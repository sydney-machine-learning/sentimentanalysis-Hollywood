1
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,277
<i>Portsmouth, December, 1787.</i>

2
00:02:28,725 --> 00:02:32,947
<i>I looked upon the vessel
that was to take me to the Island of Tahiti.</i>

3
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:35,596
<i>A destination so far from England</i>

4
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:39,343
<i>that one couldn't go farther
without starting to come home.</i>

5
00:02:39,506 --> 00:02:43,596
<i>And the length of the journey was equaled
by the importance of its mission.</i>

6
00:02:44,017 --> 00:02:47,148
<i>What could be more vital
than to find and cultivate</i>

7
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:50,381
<i>a nourishing new food
that cost nothing to grow?</i>

8
00:02:50,863 --> 00:02:54,059
<i>A blessing for the poor,
the hungry of the world.</i>

9
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,966
<i>It was a mission close to my heart.</i>

10
00:02:57,518 --> 00:02:58,979
<i>And it was I who had been chosen</i>

11
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:01,508
<i>from amongst
all the gardeners in England.</i>

12
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:04,647
<i>Oh, beg pardon.
Can you tell me if this boat is the Bounty?</i>

13
00:03:04,716 --> 00:03:06,026
- Boat, did you say?
- Yes.

14
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:09,638
- A boat! It's a ship, you landlubber.
- Hey, what kind of a seaman's this?

15
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:11,681
- He's a peddler.
- You selling something, chum?

16
00:03:11,756 --> 00:03:13,927
I'm not a peddler. I'm a gardener.

17
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,256
Assistant Botanist at
the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew.

18
00:03:17,353 --> 00:03:18,947
You know Kew Gardens, of course.

19
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:21,538
Kew's outside London.
You lost your way, mate.

20
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:23,267
Well, I haven't lost my way if this boat,

21
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,311
<i>I beg your pardon,
if this ship is the Bounty.</i>

22
00:03:25,384 --> 00:03:26,660
<i>Aye, it's the Bounty, all right.</i>

23
00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:29,345
Then, perhaps one of you gentlemen
could tell me where I sign on?

24
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:31,748
I wonder what a gardener's
doing onboard, huh?

25
00:03:31,815 --> 00:03:34,465
Gonna plant roses
in me hammock, are you?

26
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:36,159
Good thing, too, the way you smell.

27
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,044
Hold on, hold on. Look. Empty pots.

28
00:03:39,524 --> 00:03:42,459
I know. We're going to Tahiti
to fill them with something, right?

29
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:44,355
Well, one usually fills empty pots
with something.

30
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,656
- What'd you got here? Little telescope?
- Be careful, please.

31
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:49,854
These are scientific documents.
Agronomy records.

32
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:52,289
- They're what?
- Agronomy records.

33
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:54,011
They're sketches, really.

34
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:56,023
- Sketches?
- Sketches of breadfruit.

35
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:57,274
- Breadfruit?
- Breadfruit?

36
00:03:57,345 --> 00:04:00,246
You mean, where we're going,
bread grows on trees?

37
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:02,906
Bread trees.
That's daft enough for a shipload, eh?

38
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,950
There's nothing daft about breadfruit.

39
00:04:05,023 --> 00:04:07,892
It is a very real food. A staple, like wheat.

40
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:09,373
- Here.
- Goofy-looking weed.

41
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:11,674
It's funny that nobody's
ever heard of this before, then.

42
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:14,010
No one ever heard of the potato
until Sir Francis Drake

43
00:04:14,077 --> 00:04:16,891
brought it from South America.
It altered European economy.

44
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:19,028
Breadfruit may alter it again.

45
00:04:19,132 --> 00:04:20,658
I wonder what it tastes like.

46
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:23,731
The West Indies Company
plans to feed it to the slaves in Jamaica

47
00:04:23,803 --> 00:04:25,363
no matter what it tastes like.

48
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:29,110
But then, if it becomes popular,
they'll feed it to the world.

49
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,058
Gentlemen, we're about to embark
on a very momentous journey.

50
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:34,804
Personally, I'm proud to be part of it.

51
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,465
Now, where do I sign on?

52
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,542
I'll show you. Come along with me.

53
00:04:38,616 --> 00:04:40,622
Breadfruit? Did you ever hear
of that? A breadfruit?

54
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:42,484
Now come on, love, you got me money.
What more do you want?

55
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:44,656
- But when do you get paid?
- Now, come on, love. Get off the ship.

56
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:46,547
Hey, Scratch.
Sign on me mate here, will you?

57
00:04:46,614 --> 00:04:48,685
Make your mark right there.

58
00:04:56,372 --> 00:04:58,193
Captain coming aboard!

59
00:05:02,609 --> 00:05:05,708
<i>He was master of the Resolution
under Captain Cook.</i>

60
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:07,981
- What's he like?
- A hard one.

61
00:05:08,306 --> 00:05:11,784
- I sailed under him.
- But he walks like a sailor, anyway.

62
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:17,830
- Mr. Fryer.
- Captain, sir.

63
00:05:22,062 --> 00:05:24,482
- How is the crew shaping?
- A prime lot, I'd say, sir.

64
00:05:24,558 --> 00:05:26,597
- And all volunteers.
- Good.

65
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:29,672
I'd like my chest brought aboard,
Mr. Fryer.

66
00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:32,074
If you have a sober hand
who can be trusted not to desert.

67
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:33,993
At your service, sir.

68
00:05:34,154 --> 00:05:36,129
Mills is a good man, sir.

69
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:38,633
Remain by my cabin.
I'll have other errands.

70
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:40,225
Aye, aye, sir.

71
00:05:40,618 --> 00:05:42,308
Come on, give me a hand, mate.

72
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:44,515
You're not backward
in pushing yourself forward, are you?

73
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:45,991
You keep your pork-nose where it belongs

74
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:47,364
and give me a hand
with the Captain's gear.

75
00:05:47,432 --> 00:05:49,798
Well, don't be touchy, mate.
Got a long voyage ahead, you know.

76
00:05:49,864 --> 00:05:51,902
That's true. There it is.

77
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,557
Always speak up
for the easy tasks in port,

78
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:56,900
to be spared the difficult ones at sea.

79
00:06:06,084 --> 00:06:07,774
What's this? A Royal visit?

80
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,460
That's Mr. Christian's carriage, sir.

81
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:11,643
Is it, now?

82
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:19,450
So, I've had a career fop
palmed onto me as a first mate.

83
00:06:19,553 --> 00:06:22,454
- You haven't met him yet, sir?
- He was assigned only yesterday.

84
00:06:22,528 --> 00:06:24,382
Moorechild was my choice.

85
00:06:24,447 --> 00:06:27,317
He was taken ill
with some malady or other.

86
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:38,362
Aye, nothing compares with a woman
washed all over,

87
00:06:38,461 --> 00:06:40,532
smelling like a Frenchman.

88
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:51,225
Fletcher Christian, Lieutenant,
come aboard to join, sir.

89
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:55,380
Lieutenant Christian.
You are a naval lieutenant, I presume?

90
00:06:55,896 --> 00:06:57,555
Yes. Please forgive my appearance, sir.

91
00:06:57,624 --> 00:07:00,274
I was staying with friends in the country
when my orders reached me.

92
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:02,515
- So, I came directly.
- I see.

93
00:07:02,615 --> 00:07:05,517
- This is Mr. Fryer, our sailing master.
- Oh, yes.

94
00:07:05,623 --> 00:07:07,989
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Fryer.
- Same to you, Mr. Christian.

95
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,298
Yes, we sailed together.

96
00:07:09,366 --> 00:07:12,593
Let me show your men your cabin.
Your pardon, sir.

97
00:07:14,645 --> 00:07:18,189
You've come none too soon.
Please be about your duties without delay.

98
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,785
Your indulgence, sir.

99
00:07:19,892 --> 00:07:24,200
I have two charming friends here
who insist upon seeing me to my ship.

100
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:26,445
And they also insist
upon meeting the Captain.

101
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,488
They say it's important.

102
00:07:29,138 --> 00:07:30,959
- Very well.
- Thank you.

103
00:07:36,048 --> 00:07:37,836
- Hello, Ned.
- Fletcher.

104
00:07:37,936 --> 00:07:39,790
- How are you?
- I'd heard you were going to be with us.

105
00:07:39,855 --> 00:07:42,276
- Yes. We'll be together.
- What luck.

106
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,259
- Well, if you'll excuse me.
- Certainly.

107
00:07:44,334 --> 00:07:46,090
We'll dine together.

108
00:07:46,637 --> 00:07:48,971
Wonderful lad.
His mother's a great friend of the family.

109
00:07:49,037 --> 00:07:51,720
Lady Young. Wonderful horsewoman, also.

110
00:07:52,268 --> 00:07:54,242
Trains them herself, if you can imagine.

111
00:07:54,314 --> 00:07:55,624
I'll try.

112
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,671
I'm sorry, Madam. I do not speak French.

113
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:07,298
Oh, for shame, Captain.
That's uncivilized of you.

114
00:08:07,369 --> 00:08:09,059
I humbly apologize.

115
00:08:09,384 --> 00:08:12,285
May I present Captain Bligh,
the Lady Gwendolyn Arbast.

116
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,748
- Milady.
- Delighted to meet you, Captain.

117
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:18,269
May I compliment you upon your
distinguished record of command?

118
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:21,341
The compliment's
slightly premature, Milady.

119
00:08:21,446 --> 00:08:23,616
This is my first captaincy.

120
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:26,972
- The first of many, I'm sure.
- Thank you.

121
00:08:27,077 --> 00:08:28,669
Good luck, Captain.

122
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,495
Come along, Therese.

123
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,155
Excuse me, sir.

124
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:35,614
No, don't bother
to come with us, Fletcher.

125
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,997
Last minute attentions are always hollow
and you are insincere to start with.

126
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:40,415
Oh, dear.

127
00:08:45,695 --> 00:08:49,851
Well, sir,
I understand we're taking this river scow

128
00:08:49,952 --> 00:08:52,885
halfway round the world
on a grocer's errand.

129
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,965
I take a somewhat different view.

130
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,044
So do their Lordships of the Admiralty.

131
00:08:57,118 --> 00:08:59,734
- Do they really? How extraordinary.
- Tell me,

132
00:08:59,837 --> 00:09:03,184
what is a man of your particular interests
doing in the navy?

133
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,495
Oh, process of elimination.

134
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:09,780
There's something dusty about the army
and affairs of state are rather a bore.

135
00:09:09,851 --> 00:09:12,217
You know, one must do something.

136
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:14,584
Here's a fellow
trying to catch your eye, sir.

137
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,925
Looks like an embalmer.

138
00:09:15,993 --> 00:09:17,684
Beg pardon, sir. Might I have a word?

139
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:19,792
- Are you our gardener from Kew?
- Yes, sir. Brown, sir.

140
00:09:19,865 --> 00:09:21,937
- Good. Found your quarters yet?
- No, sir.

141
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:25,073
Get him a good billet.
This is the most important man aboard.

142
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:27,477
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Well, I'm hardly that, but thank you, sir.

143
00:09:27,543 --> 00:09:30,390
I have a message for you, sir,
from our chief botanist.

144
00:09:30,454 --> 00:09:31,533
Well, what is it?

145
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:34,671
He has reached the conclusion that
the breadfruit has a dormant period, sir.

146
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,707
According to his experiments,
it begins some time in October.

147
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,373
A dormant period?

148
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:41,711
Four or five months
when the fruit cannot be transplanted.

149
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,055
The cuttings die.

150
00:09:43,123 --> 00:09:45,130
Well, October's some way off.

151
00:09:45,202 --> 00:09:46,379
That shouldn't worry us,

152
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,718
unless your botanist
is wrong about the date.

153
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:49,930
Exactly, sir.

154
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:52,041
- Mr. Christian.
- Yes, sir?

155
00:09:53,297 --> 00:09:54,725
Oh, sir,

156
00:09:55,568 --> 00:09:59,528
does it really matter
when these vegetables arrive in Jamaica?

157
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:03,818
It matters to the tune
of £1,000 a day, Mr. Christian.

158
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:06,602
My word,
that is an impressive amount, yes.

159
00:10:06,702 --> 00:10:09,068
The West India merchants
are impressed by it.

160
00:10:09,134 --> 00:10:11,521
So is the Admiralty. And so am I.

161
00:10:11,853 --> 00:10:14,241
It is my intention
to land our cargo in Jamaica,

162
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:17,415
as far ahead of the Admiralty's timetable
as is humanly possible.

163
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,905
Yes. Well, one can understand that.

164
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,752
Doing so, one can look forward
to promotions and even honors.

165
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:25,507
And all that, yes.

166
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:28,325
I will do exactly all that, Mr. Christian.

167
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:31,208
Which brings me
to the subject of yourself.

168
00:10:31,272 --> 00:10:34,086
I will tolerate nothing less
than a man's best efforts,

169
00:10:34,152 --> 00:10:35,645
officer or seaman.

170
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,167
Highborn connections
are no substitute for hard work.

171
00:10:39,654 --> 00:10:41,509
No, indeed they're not, sir.

172
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:43,356
But, personally, I see no reason

173
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,528
why a good officer
cannot be a gentleman, as well.

174
00:10:46,598 --> 00:10:50,207
- Do you disagree, sir?
- Not if he's first a good officer.

175
00:10:50,276 --> 00:10:51,966
It's a debatable point,

176
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:55,069
but a good subject
for a dinner's conversation.

177
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:57,505
But I'm keeping Mr. Brown waiting.

178
00:10:57,602 --> 00:11:00,985
And I mustn't neglect
the most important man on our ship.

179
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:03,832
Excuse me, sir.

180
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:05,910
Hello, Brown.

181
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:15,795
- Make ready for sail, Mr. Christian.
- Aye, aye, sir.

182
00:11:16,222 --> 00:11:18,839
Hands to stations for leaving harbor!

183
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,371
Aye, aye, sir!

184
00:11:24,508 --> 00:11:27,824
All hands to stations for leaving harbor!

185
00:11:28,475 --> 00:11:30,198
All hands on deck!

186
00:11:35,002 --> 00:11:38,547
All hands to stations for leaving harbor!

187
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:07,503
All right, now, heavy on it!

188
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,447
Step round.

189
00:12:10,065 --> 00:12:11,854
Let go and hold!

190
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,135
Ship ready for sea, sir.

191
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,338
Set topsails and headsails. Starboard tack.

192
00:12:28,301 --> 00:12:30,090
Set topsails and headsails.

193
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:33,058
Set topsails and headsails!

194
00:12:37,741 --> 00:12:38,983
Set gallants!

195
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:41,091
- Set gallants!
- Sheet home!

196
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,807
Set royals!

197
00:12:56,903 --> 00:12:58,910
Set royals!

198
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:04,582
Midships, steady as she goes.

199
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:54,008
- Bos'n's mate!
- Aye, sir?

200
00:13:54,074 --> 00:13:55,634
Pipe up spirits.

201
00:13:58,522 --> 00:14:00,430
Up spirits!

202
00:14:00,793 --> 00:14:04,174
Watch below,
muster for grog on the upper deck!

203
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,819
Hey, Mills.

204
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:14,957
Mr. Christian wants a word with you
on the quarterdeck.

205
00:14:15,478 --> 00:14:17,780
The fact is,
I'm a little slow sometimes and...

206
00:14:17,845 --> 00:14:19,055
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon.

207
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:20,586
Mack here is reporting a theft.

208
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,732
- What? Already?
- Aye, sir.

209
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:26,059
Carry on with your investigations.

210
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:35,757
Seaman Mills at your service, sir.
No labor too long, no job too hard, sir.

211
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:41,896
Well, you're a light-hearted fellow,
as well as a light-fingered one.

212
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,527
Sir?

213
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:47,427
It seems that in a moment of exuberance,
you stole two 25-pound cheeses.

214
00:14:47,503 --> 00:14:49,739
I stole two 25-pound cheeses, sir?

215
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,411
You wish to deny it?

216
00:14:55,117 --> 00:14:56,644
Well, speak up, Mills.

217
00:14:56,748 --> 00:14:59,782
Why, yes I do, sir. Of course. Certainly, sir.

218
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:04,586
First of all, sir,
I'd be grateful to know who's accusing me.

219
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,039
Yes, of course. This observant chap here

220
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:10,310
says he saw you take them
before we left Portsmouth.

221
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:13,726
Well, he saw wrong, sir.
Or else he's a bloody liar.

222
00:15:15,945 --> 00:15:19,970
- Are you a bloody liar? Answer freely.
- No, sir.

223
00:15:20,071 --> 00:15:23,300
I saw him take them those two cheeses
with me own eyes.

224
00:15:23,815 --> 00:15:28,570
Mr. Christian, testing one man's word
against another's is an empty procedure.

225
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:32,701
List the shortage as unsolved theft
and stop the men's cheese ration

226
00:15:32,773 --> 00:15:35,936
- until the deficit is made up.
- As you say, sir.

227
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,602
- Well, that'll be all, Mills.
- Thank you, sir.

228
00:15:43,683 --> 00:15:45,689
Was there something further
you wished to discuss?

229
00:15:45,762 --> 00:15:48,150
Early Renaissance sketching, perhaps?

230
00:15:48,257 --> 00:15:50,012
No, sir. Sorry, sir.

231
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:07,768
Let it lay, whatever it is. Let it lay.

232
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:11,513
- I got a little score to settle.
- Look, son, this is a small ship.

233
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:14,394
Fill it with grudges
and there'd be no room left to live in.

234
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,879
And you're listening to 30 years at sea.

235
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:20,183
You don't preach to me, McCoy,
and I won't preach to you. All right?

236
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,039
It's a good bargain,

237
00:16:23,448 --> 00:16:25,205
with you the loser.

238
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:38,861
You can thank
your good friend Mills for this.

239
00:16:41,748 --> 00:16:45,097
Now, this is the way it's gonna be.
Captain's orders.

240
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:47,822
There'll be no cheese issue
until the shortage is made up.

241
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:49,834
You understand? And you?

242
00:16:54,162 --> 00:16:57,031
So we've got a bootlicker onboard, eh?

243
00:16:59,441 --> 00:17:01,001
A troublemaker.

244
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:04,454
- It wasn't my fault.
- Hey, what's the matter?

245
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,276
I don't like to be called a thief, that's all.

246
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:09,318
- A thief?
- A thief, that's right.

247
00:17:09,391 --> 00:17:10,568
I'll teach you a lesson.

248
00:17:10,637 --> 00:17:12,742
- Squealing on the boys.
- Hey!

249
00:17:12,846 --> 00:17:14,788
I like a bit of cheese with my grub.

250
00:17:14,862 --> 00:17:17,731
Maybe it's you
who should take the licking.

251
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,587
Now look here.

252
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:23,715
It was the Captain asked me
take the cheeses to his home, as a favor.

253
00:17:23,787 --> 00:17:26,275
It's always the same in this blasted navy.

254
00:17:26,347 --> 00:17:29,445
You do a job for an officer like that,
you're called a thief.

255
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:31,041
And the crew lose their cheeses.

256
00:17:31,114 --> 00:17:33,448
- So, you did the Captain a favor, eh?
- It was the Captain.

257
00:17:33,513 --> 00:17:35,422
The Captain helping himself
to the ship's stores.

258
00:17:35,498 --> 00:17:38,562
- Hey.
- The Captain's the thief, not me!

259
00:17:48,006 --> 00:17:50,242
The Articles of War
provide most adequately

260
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:53,058
for a man who calls his Captain a thief.

261
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,998
I think a few weeks without grog
will teach him to hold his tongue.

262
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,165
No. Two dozen with the lash
will teach him better still.

263
00:18:03,266 --> 00:18:06,648
All hands to witness punishment.
Mr. Christian, if you please.

264
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:58,444
"If any officer, mariner or soldier,
in or belonging to the fleet,

265
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:01,867
"shall behave himself
with contempt to his superior officer,

266
00:19:01,973 --> 00:19:04,940
"such superior officer
being in the execution of his office,

267
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:08,841
"he shall be punished
according to the nature of his offense."

268
00:19:09,651 --> 00:19:11,309
Two dozen lashes.

269
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:13,674
Ship's company, on hats.

270
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:25,641
You just remember,
it ain't me that's whipping you.

271
00:19:25,712 --> 00:19:27,718
Don't worry, I'll live.

272
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,027
You know, mate, it ain't me. Remember.

273
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,942
Stop worrying. You're making me nervous.

274
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,428
Lay on, Quintal.

275
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,771
One.

276
00:19:51,594 --> 00:19:52,739
Two.

277
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:56,227
Three.

278
00:19:58,025 --> 00:19:59,138
Four.

279
00:20:01,192 --> 00:20:02,305
Five.

280
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:07,457
- Six.
- You're going too lightly, Quintal.

281
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,427
Lay on with a will or you'll take his place.

282
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:15,071
Seven.

283
00:20:15,558 --> 00:20:16,735
Eight.

284
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:20,093
Nine.

285
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:22,204
Ten.

286
00:20:23,427 --> 00:20:24,671
Eleven.

287
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,938
Twelve.

288
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,596
You were ordered to witness punishment.
You can't turn away.

289
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:30,942
Thirteen.

290
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:34,205
Fourteen.

291
00:20:35,264 --> 00:20:36,508
Fifteen.

292
00:20:37,472 --> 00:20:38,749
Sixteen.

293
00:20:39,392 --> 00:20:40,733
Seventeen.

294
00:20:44,607 --> 00:20:45,883
Eighteen.

295
00:20:47,389 --> 00:20:48,698
Nineteen.

296
00:20:50,845 --> 00:20:52,121
Twenty.

297
00:20:53,245 --> 00:20:54,652
Twenty-one.

298
00:20:56,604 --> 00:20:58,010
Twenty-two.

299
00:20:59,611 --> 00:21:01,040
Twenty-three.

300
00:21:02,683 --> 00:21:04,089
Twenty-four.

301
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,996
Company dismissed!

302
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:45,289
Lay away lee braces!

303
00:22:05,965 --> 00:22:07,939
You are not eating, Mr. Young.

304
00:22:08,043 --> 00:22:10,530
- With your permission, I'm not hungry, sir.
- Permission denied.

305
00:22:10,603 --> 00:22:11,977
We'll not have food wasted.

306
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:14,114
- Eat your supper.
- Aye, sir.

307
00:22:17,706 --> 00:22:20,160
Not a very sociable group tonight.

308
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:21,378
As a matter of fact, sir,

309
00:22:21,448 --> 00:22:22,975
I was about to make a remark
when you spoke.

310
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:24,259
You're pardoned.

311
00:22:24,327 --> 00:22:26,977
Something troubling you, Mr. Christian?

312
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:29,797
No, sir. It's nothing. I just...

313
00:22:31,366 --> 00:22:33,821
Well, I don't feel my cheeriest after

314
00:22:33,926 --> 00:22:36,259
watching a man take a severe lashing.

315
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:38,877
Pass Mr. Young the potatoes, please.

316
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:41,795
You've witnessed punishment
before, surely.

317
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,499
Go ahead, speak your mind.

318
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:53,175
Well, sir, since you ask, it's...

319
00:22:54,018 --> 00:22:56,952
It's the question of degree
that troubles me.

320
00:22:57,057 --> 00:23:01,180
You see, if one flogs a man half to death
for a minor infraction,

321
00:23:01,856 --> 00:23:04,637
then how does one punish him
for a serious offense?

322
00:23:04,703 --> 00:23:06,873
Minor infraction, you said?

323
00:23:07,294 --> 00:23:09,465
Yes. I think that two cheeses, sir...

324
00:23:09,534 --> 00:23:12,501
Plus the word "thief"
applied to his Captain.

325
00:23:12,957 --> 00:23:14,266
But you still feel, though,

326
00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:16,721
that stopping the man's grog
was sufficient punishment?

327
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:18,738
Well, I agree with you.

328
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,608
- You agree?
- Eat it up. Excellent stew.

329
00:23:23,898 --> 00:23:26,931
If we were concerned
with only the one case, certainly.

330
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,911
- Well, I don't know...
- Hear me.

331
00:23:30,905 --> 00:23:34,700
You will, all of you, no doubt
command your own ships some day.

332
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:37,197
Let us suppose
that your vessel is running in heavy seas.

333
00:23:37,271 --> 00:23:39,604
The shrouds are covered with ice.
A gale is blowing.

334
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:42,354
It becomes necessary, in your opinion,
to order a seaman aloft.

335
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,850
He realizes, of course,

336
00:23:43,926 --> 00:23:46,543
that if his fingers slip from the icy shrouds
for a split second,

337
00:23:46,613 --> 00:23:48,621
he'll perish immediately.

338
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,188
Now, this is a typical seaman,

339
00:23:51,252 --> 00:23:54,929
a half-witted, wife-beating,
habitual drunkard.

340
00:23:55,027 --> 00:23:57,514
His whole life is spent evading
and defying authority.

341
00:23:57,586 --> 00:24:01,033
Tell me, sir.
What is it that makes this man go aloft?

342
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:06,413
I think, depending on the man, sir,
any number of things.

343
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:08,781
You can put it in one word. Fear.

344
00:24:08,848 --> 00:24:10,735
Fear of what you'll do to him.

345
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,589
Fear of punishment so vivid in his mind

346
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:14,990
that he fears it even more
than sudden death.

347
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:16,809
Now don't mistake me.

348
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:20,620
I'm not advising cruelty or brutality
with no purpose.

349
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:24,456
My point is that cruelty with purpose
is not cruelty.

350
00:24:24,525 --> 00:24:26,052
It's efficiency.

351
00:24:26,124 --> 00:24:28,130
But a man will never disobey you

352
00:24:28,204 --> 00:24:30,920
once he's watched
his mate's backbone laid bare.

353
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,255
He'll remember
those white ribs staring at him,

354
00:24:33,323 --> 00:24:34,665
he'll see the flesh jump

355
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,925
and hear the whistle of the whip
for the rest of his life.

356
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,966
Well, perhaps you're right, sir.

357
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:54,820
I'd be careful of that cheese
if I were you, sir.

358
00:24:54,886 --> 00:24:58,367
It has a peculiar smell.
I think it's a bit tainted.

359
00:25:02,596 --> 00:25:06,207
But then, of course,
it's a question of individual taste.

360
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:11,998
It's damn good port.

361
00:25:13,826 --> 00:25:15,036
<i>In the following weeks,</i>

362
00:25:15,107 --> 00:25:18,902
<i>Captain Bligh worked the ship
for every furlong of gain it could give.</i>

363
00:25:19,008 --> 00:25:21,179
<i>Every inch of canvas spread,</i>

364
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,753
<i>and God help the helmsman
if the wake were not arrow-straight.</i>

365
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:29,947
<i>Captain Bligh must've asked me
the same question a score of times.</i>

366
00:25:30,046 --> 00:25:33,788
<i>"What day saw the beginning
of the breadfruit's dormant period?"</i>

367
00:25:33,885 --> 00:25:35,380
<i>I told him repeatedly,</i>

368
00:25:35,484 --> 00:25:39,095
<i>I could not name the exact date
for lack of knowing it.</i>

369
00:25:40,828 --> 00:25:44,625
<i>It became clear he'd begun to worry
lest we arrive too late.</i>

370
00:25:45,595 --> 00:25:49,870
<i>He studied his charts hour on hour,
I could not imagine why.</i>

371
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:54,706
<i>I'd been told there was only one way
to get to the other side of the world.</i>

372
00:25:54,872 --> 00:25:57,621
<i>The long way,
around the Cape of Good Hope</i>

373
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,541
<i>at the bottom of Africa.</i>

374
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,389
<i>That was the course with favoring winds.</i>

375
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,508
<i>As for the other route,
the westward passage around the Horn,</i>

376
00:26:07,062 --> 00:26:10,890
<i>while arithmetic said "yes" to that,
weather said "no."</i>

377
00:27:13,927 --> 00:27:16,000
May I share your merriment?

378
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:18,142
Just a pleasantry, sir. It was nothing.

379
00:27:18,214 --> 00:27:20,003
Mayn't I be included?

380
00:27:20,357 --> 00:27:22,812
Well, it was just the way
you were walking, sir.

381
00:27:22,884 --> 00:27:26,180
It reminded me of a mutual friend,
Lord Folkestone.

382
00:27:26,693 --> 00:27:29,309
- Do continue.
- Well, that's all, sir.

383
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:32,762
What was the resemblance?

384
00:27:33,858 --> 00:27:36,575
Well, you just both have
this distinctive walk, sir.

385
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:39,543
Really? In what way distinctive?

386
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:43,289
Well, he was kicked by a horse, sir.

387
00:27:44,992 --> 00:27:46,682
I'd rather not say where, sir.

388
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:49,239
It had the effect
of making him walk most oddly.

389
00:27:49,311 --> 00:27:50,804
Poor fellow.

390
00:27:53,533 --> 00:27:54,710
I see.

391
00:27:57,054 --> 00:28:00,882
You may make yourself comfortable
at the masthead, Mr. Young.

392
00:28:00,957 --> 00:28:03,640
Please remain there until I summon you.

393
00:28:04,731 --> 00:28:06,041
Aye, sir.

394
00:28:09,275 --> 00:28:13,398
Don't repeat that mistake, Mr. Christian.
I'm not a figure of fun.

395
00:28:13,753 --> 00:28:15,760
Indeed, you're not, sir.

396
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:19,311
- Make the course south southwest, please.
- Aye, aye, sir.

397
00:28:19,384 --> 00:28:20,790
Bos'n's mate!

398
00:28:20,888 --> 00:28:23,669
- Did you say south southwest, sir?
- I did.

399
00:28:25,143 --> 00:28:28,623
- Lee braces!
- Lee braces it is, sir!

400
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:32,721
- Down helm.
- Down helm, sir!

401
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:36,301
- Hold her steady south southwest.
- South southwest, sir.

402
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:41,133
- Take away those weather sheets!
- Aye, aye, sir.

403
00:28:41,235 --> 00:28:44,812
Going around the Horn
will take five months off our journey.

404
00:28:44,914 --> 00:28:48,427
Well, we shall have ourselves
quite a little adventure.

405
00:28:49,553 --> 00:28:51,308
What amuses you now?

406
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:55,628
I was just thinking, sir,
that our little errand for groceries

407
00:28:55,696 --> 00:28:58,566
might wind up in a page of naval history.

408
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:01,453
If we succeed in negotiating the Horn
in the dead of winter.

409
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:04,268
Why shouldn't we succeed?
Admiral Anderson did.

410
00:29:04,334 --> 00:29:08,742
Yes, but of course he didn't choose
to attempt it in a 91-foot chamber pot.

411
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:10,568
In any event,
his was the only ship to do it,

412
00:29:10,637 --> 00:29:13,603
and I believe
he lost 50 percent of his crew.

413
00:29:13,868 --> 00:29:17,641
You might point that out to the crew.
It should improve their performance.

414
00:29:17,706 --> 00:29:21,187
Remember, fear is our best weapon.
Good night, sir.

415
00:29:21,355 --> 00:29:25,893
- When should I recall Mr. Young, sir?
- When I come on deck in the morning.

416
00:29:26,154 --> 00:29:29,349
I want to see how comically he walks.
Poor fellow.

417
00:29:29,415 --> 00:29:32,677
But, perhaps, in the morning, sir,
he won't be able to walk at all.

418
00:29:32,743 --> 00:29:33,986
Perhaps.

419
00:29:37,062 --> 00:29:38,688
Good night, sir.

420
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:48,900
Good fellow.

421
00:29:59,842 --> 00:30:03,419
Begging your pardon, sir.
Are we really making for the Horn?

422
00:30:03,489 --> 00:30:05,015
Yes, evidently.

423
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:08,948
May Heaven protect us.
I was in Admiral Anderson's ship, sir.

424
00:30:11,295 --> 00:30:14,196
Were you, really?
Did you find it interesting?

425
00:30:14,303 --> 00:30:15,927
Interesting, sir?

426
00:30:16,445 --> 00:30:19,576
It was like riding a cork
over a waterfall, sir.

427
00:30:19,645 --> 00:30:23,157
And wind is not the name
for what blows in your face.

428
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:27,667
It's something made of iron,
swings at you from the west,

429
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:30,291
never changing, day in and day out.

430
00:30:31,098 --> 00:30:33,717
With seas as high as the mainmast.

431
00:30:34,554 --> 00:30:36,724
We had lifelines rigged everywhere, sir,

432
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,826
and there were still 16 men
washed overboard.

433
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,353
Cold?

434
00:30:43,671 --> 00:30:45,907
Three men froze in the yards.

435
00:30:46,968 --> 00:30:48,624
Frozen stiff, sir.

436
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:53,362
Couldn't get them down without cutting
their fingers loose from the shrouds.

437
00:30:54,325 --> 00:30:55,754
I was lucky.

438
00:30:58,516 --> 00:31:02,793
Well, that's the Horn for you, sir.
A delightful passage.

439
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,913
Good morning, sir.

440
00:31:29,549 --> 00:31:32,712
And good morning to you, Ned.
Did you sleep well?

441
00:31:33,548 --> 00:31:36,515
- My hands, I can't move them at all.
- Steady.

442
00:31:36,588 --> 00:31:37,897
Easy, Ned.

443
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:40,842
- There's no feeling in them, Fletcher.
- Easy, Ned. Easy, Ned.

444
00:31:40,906 --> 00:31:43,208
None at all.
Can't you understand? Absolute...

445
00:31:43,274 --> 00:31:45,313
You're being undignified.

446
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:48,194
Yes, of course. I'm sorry.

447
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:49,671
Come along.

448
00:31:51,305 --> 00:31:53,442
I don't think I can walk very well, Fletcher.

449
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,038
Well, don't be self-conscious.

450
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:57,151
We shall probably
all walk like Lord Folkestone

451
00:31:57,222 --> 00:31:58,979
before this voyage is over.

452
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:04,860
There you are.

453
00:32:05,894 --> 00:32:08,260
Very good, Ned. Very good.

454
00:32:18,914 --> 00:32:20,986
She's straining badly, sir.

455
00:32:22,913 --> 00:32:26,426
Yes, I'll have the t'gallants off of her,
Mr. Morrison.

456
00:32:26,688 --> 00:32:29,721
Watch on deck, t'gallants fore line!

457
00:32:30,592 --> 00:32:32,763
Bos'n's mate, call all hands!

458
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:37,463
All hands on deck!

459
00:32:42,332 --> 00:32:44,373
Step lively, now. Come on.

460
00:32:45,085 --> 00:32:46,458
Jump to it!

461
00:32:48,347 --> 00:32:51,892
Try again...

462
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,584
Come on, let's get on with it!

463
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:57,552
We don't want be here if this stick breaks!

464
00:33:11,543 --> 00:33:13,647
I think that's better, sir.

465
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:16,078
I have seen this storm.

466
00:33:19,317 --> 00:33:22,131
Afraid of a little weather, Mr. Christian?

467
00:33:22,195 --> 00:33:23,603
Set the t'gallants again.

468
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:26,154
But, you see, sir,
the masts are straining, sir.

469
00:33:26,227 --> 00:33:28,462
- You arguing with me?
- By no means, sir.

470
00:33:28,563 --> 00:33:31,148
I was simply answering your question.

471
00:33:31,953 --> 00:33:35,498
- Mr. Morrison, set the t'gallants again!
- Aye, sir!

472
00:33:36,592 --> 00:33:40,236
All right, you men.
Up aloft and set the t'gallants again.

473
00:33:40,304 --> 00:33:43,816
Any excuse to retard our progress, eh,
Mr. Christian?

474
00:33:44,366 --> 00:33:45,610
But you wrong me, sir,

475
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,906
if you believe that
I would willfully obstruct our progress.

476
00:33:49,006 --> 00:33:53,227
Come now, why don't you admit
you wouldn't lift a finger to speed it?

477
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,641
But that's absurd, sir.
Why should I not wish to do my best?

478
00:33:57,708 --> 00:34:00,074
Because you are
the sort of self-styled gentleman

479
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,961
who thinks only one thought.

480
00:34:02,027 --> 00:34:04,580
You feel only one emotion, contempt.

481
00:34:05,226 --> 00:34:07,811
Contempt for effort, for ambition,

482
00:34:07,914 --> 00:34:10,117
for anyone born
less fortunate than yourself.

483
00:34:10,185 --> 00:34:12,454
You are poisoned with contempt,
Mr. Christian,

484
00:34:12,521 --> 00:34:14,822
and it makes you useless to me.

485
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,570
But I assure you, sir,
that the execution of my duties

486
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,934
is entirely unaffected
by my private opinion of you.

487
00:34:21,223 --> 00:34:25,215
Be certain of that, Mr. Christian.
Be most entirely certain.

488
00:34:26,342 --> 00:34:28,097
Land ho!

489
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:32,094
Land ho!

490
00:34:37,954 --> 00:34:40,507
Prepare the ship for heavy weather,
if you please.

491
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,040
Aye, aye, sir.

492
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:46,591
Bos'n, prepare the ship for heavy weather!

493
00:34:46,657 --> 00:34:48,118
Aye, aye, sir!

494
00:34:53,504 --> 00:34:55,326
Ahoy, below!

495
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,013
Breakers dead ahead!

496
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,858
They ain't no breakers. They're combers.

497
00:35:04,925 --> 00:35:07,097
Two oceans meeting head on.

498
00:35:25,144 --> 00:35:26,900
Lend a hand, Norman.

499
00:35:31,126 --> 00:35:34,127
Captain's orders to wear ship,
Mr. Christian!

500
00:35:34,615 --> 00:35:36,435
- Do so!
- Aye, aye, sir!

501
00:35:41,237 --> 00:35:44,498
All hands on deck! Come on!

502
00:35:45,044 --> 00:35:47,148
Come on, come on. All hands lay aloft!

503
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:48,910
We've only just come below.

504
00:35:49,011 --> 00:35:50,897
Listen here, what's he think he's doing?

505
00:35:50,962 --> 00:35:52,172
Come on, come on!

506
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:13,033
The forward storeroom, sir!
A barrel has broken loose.

507
00:36:13,709 --> 00:36:16,043
- Take over, Mr. Fryer!
- Aye, aye, sir!

508
00:36:17,548 --> 00:36:18,792
Up helm!

509
00:36:18,892 --> 00:36:20,266
Up helm!

510
00:36:20,364 --> 00:36:22,119
Quickly there. Move!

511
00:36:22,668 --> 00:36:25,221
Mills, Norman, Bennet...

512
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,436
Watch it!

513
00:36:54,755 --> 00:36:56,000
Bennet!

514
00:36:59,748 --> 00:37:02,911
Wait a moment. Go tell Mr. Fryer
to let her run before the wind.

515
00:37:02,979 --> 00:37:04,188
Right!

516
00:37:05,346 --> 00:37:07,615
We've got to get a lash on it.

517
00:37:17,663 --> 00:37:19,735
- Mr. Fryer, sir.
- What is it, Mills?

518
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,042
Mr. Christian said,
let her run before the wind.

519
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,223
Before the wind?

520
00:37:23,294 --> 00:37:25,681
We can't lash the barrels
until she steadies.

521
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:28,179
- All right, go below.
- Right you are, sir.

522
00:37:28,861 --> 00:37:31,859
- Midships to helm!
- Midships to helm!

523
00:37:49,784 --> 00:37:51,539
Quintal, stand away.

524
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:54,797
Now hold off till she steadies.

525
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:09,201
Hold her steady before the wind!

526
00:38:14,738 --> 00:38:16,167
All right, she's steady.

527
00:38:16,241 --> 00:38:19,056
Norman, Quintal, get a lash on that cask.

528
00:38:20,018 --> 00:38:21,577
Pass me a line!

529
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:48,869
What the hell are you doing, Mr. Fryer?

530
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:51,336
Mr. Christian's orders, sir.
Barrel broke loose...

531
00:38:51,401 --> 00:38:55,046
- Put the helm over instantly!
- But Mr. Christian's below, sir,

532
00:38:55,113 --> 00:38:57,568
- with a work party.
- Put the helm over!

533
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,706
- Down with helm.
- Down with helm, it is, sir.

534
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:01,985
Idiots!

535
00:39:28,386 --> 00:39:30,240
Secure those barrels.

536
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,317
Easy now, easy.

537
00:39:48,509 --> 00:39:49,753
Careful.

538
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:55,642
Gently now.

539
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:01,334
Move him carefully.

540
00:40:18,358 --> 00:40:20,530
I'll get the medicine chest.

541
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:33,904
- He's dead.
- Mr. Christian!

542
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:36,364
Mr. Christian!

543
00:40:39,026 --> 00:40:41,708
Are you deaf as well as irresponsible?

544
00:40:41,777 --> 00:40:43,718
I demand an explanation.

545
00:40:44,656 --> 00:40:46,663
I thought she was holding
steadily enough, sir.

546
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,361
I ordered Norman under a water cask...

547
00:40:48,431 --> 00:40:50,667
Never mind Norman. Answer me.

548
00:40:51,343 --> 00:40:53,098
Never mind Norman, sir?

549
00:40:53,167 --> 00:40:56,200
There was no justification
in your ordering the ship hove to.

550
00:40:56,269 --> 00:40:58,604
We lost a full league
before I could countermand your order,

551
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,043
one full league!

552
00:41:00,142 --> 00:41:03,719
- You countermanded my order, sir?
- Now, you heed me well, Mr. Christian.

553
00:41:03,787 --> 00:41:05,959
We are embarked upon a King's mission.

554
00:41:06,059 --> 00:41:09,355
Any further attempt at sabotage
and I will deal with you as a traitor.

555
00:41:09,419 --> 00:41:11,175
When you countermanded that order, sir,

556
00:41:11,243 --> 00:41:14,056
you crushed the life
out of Thomas Norman.

557
00:41:15,017 --> 00:41:18,978
I suppose you would halt the ship again
for his burial service.

558
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,058
Since we are not at war, sir,

559
00:41:21,128 --> 00:41:23,746
I would hope to give him a decent burial.
Yes, sir.

560
00:41:23,816 --> 00:41:25,125
I am at war.

561
00:41:25,223 --> 00:41:28,604
Against ill winds, contrary currents
and incompetent officers.

562
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:30,850
You'd best join my war, Mr. Christian,

563
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:34,745
for if I don't start winning soon,
the casualty list will be real enough.

564
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,742
Aye, aye, sir!

565
00:42:23,835 --> 00:42:26,321
I make our position here
by dead reckoning.

566
00:42:26,394 --> 00:42:28,814
If that's right, sir,
another three weeks will see us through.

567
00:42:28,889 --> 00:42:31,606
We'll get through.
The pumps holding their own?

568
00:42:31,672 --> 00:42:33,745
- Aye, sir.
- Good.

569
00:42:33,848 --> 00:42:37,556
We'll go on the other tack now.
Tack ship, if you please.

570
00:42:37,624 --> 00:42:39,116
Aye, aye, sir.

571
00:42:40,118 --> 00:42:42,093
All hands on deck!

572
00:42:42,486 --> 00:42:45,104
Tack ship! Come on, Williams, up top!

573
00:42:45,557 --> 00:42:47,945
- Gently, gently.
- Get up, the Horn waits for no man.

574
00:42:48,021 --> 00:42:51,468
He'll drown the lot of us.
I know the way that man's mind works.

575
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:54,855
- I felt it on my back.
- Stop your grousing.

576
00:42:55,602 --> 00:42:59,049
Portsmouth or Cape Horn,
it's all one to a seaman.

577
00:43:06,353 --> 00:43:09,221
Well, it can't stay overcast forever, sir.

578
00:43:10,383 --> 00:43:15,116
Four weeks blind tacking is forever,
Mr. Fryer, and you know it!

579
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,173
Other tack, wear ship!

580
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,346
Downwind in this weather, sir,
is very dangerous.

581
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:32,266
We have no choice!

582
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:37,443
- Weather braces!
- Aye, aye, sir!

583
00:43:40,169 --> 00:43:44,642
Starboard watch on deck!
Starboard watch on deck!

584
00:43:46,344 --> 00:43:48,166
All hands on deck!

585
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:00,927
What's the matter?

586
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:52,626
Up helm!

587
00:45:00,534 --> 00:45:02,673
Steer two points to starboard!

588
00:45:02,774 --> 00:45:04,780
Be ready to reverse your helm!

589
00:45:04,886 --> 00:45:08,115
Lay away lee braces! All the way!

590
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:10,637
All the way weather braces!

591
00:45:11,924 --> 00:45:14,825
We're back where we started
four weeks ago!

592
00:45:26,865 --> 00:45:29,832
Bad news, sir.
Your cabin's completely awash.

593
00:45:38,991 --> 00:45:42,186
The pumps are barely able
to hold their own, sir.

594
00:45:42,927 --> 00:45:44,998
We've lost, Mr. Fryer.

595
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:49,664
- Make way for the Cape of Good Hope.
- Aye, aye, sir!

596
00:46:32,418 --> 00:46:35,319
Lay away lee braces!

597
00:46:38,913 --> 00:46:41,694
Downward off the mizzen.

598
00:46:48,766 --> 00:46:51,286
Here, here, here. What's all this, then?

599
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,178
That, old son, is half a ration of meat.

600
00:46:53,246 --> 00:46:55,733
- What do you mean half a ration?
- Captain's orders.

601
00:46:55,805 --> 00:46:59,578
Orders! You dish up a full plate of that
or I'll cut your curls off.

602
00:46:59,644 --> 00:47:01,432
I don't make the rules, I just dish the stuff.

603
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,060
That's all you're gonna get,
you'd better take it.

604
00:47:03,132 --> 00:47:05,586
He's right.
Half-rations are better than none at all.

605
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:08,528
- Why half-rations? What for?
- Make up time, I suppose.

606
00:47:08,603 --> 00:47:10,904
Well, starving a man
doesn't make the ship go no faster.

607
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,595
It saves stopping for stores, doesn't it?

608
00:47:12,665 --> 00:47:15,861
Oh, so to catch up a couple of weeks,
we starve all the way to Tahiti, eh?

609
00:47:15,929 --> 00:47:19,757
I'll tell you one thing,
it's against the regulations.

610
00:47:20,247 --> 00:47:21,676
Regulations?

611
00:47:24,503 --> 00:47:27,371
If we can be flogged by the regulations,
we can be fed by them.

612
00:47:27,446 --> 00:47:29,453
Good. You convinced me.

613
00:47:29,526 --> 00:47:31,597
Now, go and convince the Captain.

614
00:47:32,598 --> 00:47:33,971
All right.

615
00:47:34,356 --> 00:47:36,212
Anybody coming along with me?

616
00:47:36,276 --> 00:47:38,862
- To see the Captain?
- That's right, the Captain.

617
00:47:38,931 --> 00:47:41,451
You sure it's regulation?
How do you know?

618
00:47:41,523 --> 00:47:42,929
Because I read them.

619
00:47:43,858 --> 00:47:47,154
A sailor with an education,
like a singing pig.

620
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,191
All right, I'm with you.

621
00:47:51,152 --> 00:47:53,967
What are you men
doing in these quarters?

622
00:47:54,257 --> 00:47:56,938
I brought them, sir.
They wish to state a complaint.

623
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:58,251
Let them do so.

624
00:48:00,747 --> 00:48:02,088
Speak up.

625
00:48:04,586 --> 00:48:08,001
I'm begging your pardon, sir.
We're sorry to disturb you, sir.

626
00:48:10,249 --> 00:48:13,697
If this isn't a good moment, sir,
why, this is nothing that won't...

627
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:15,523
That won't keep a while, sir.

628
00:48:15,591 --> 00:48:17,599
No, no, no. Please continue.

629
00:48:17,672 --> 00:48:20,421
I'm always available to hear complaints.

630
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:24,350
Well, Captain, sir, we've...

631
00:48:24,805 --> 00:48:27,455
We've come representing the whole crew.

632
00:48:27,557 --> 00:48:29,977
It's about the half-rations, sir.

633
00:48:30,564 --> 00:48:32,635
And they ain't right, sir.

634
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,201
I'd like to...

635
00:48:35,267 --> 00:48:39,128
The crew would like to remind you, sir,
what it says in the regulations.

636
00:48:39,587 --> 00:48:42,237
You dare to quote the regulations to me?

637
00:48:42,305 --> 00:48:44,477
The regulations was made to go by, sir.

638
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:46,933
We don't mean no impertinence, sir.

639
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,828
But right is right, sir.

640
00:48:48,896 --> 00:48:52,986
Five full months you've cost me,
you fumbling idlers.

641
00:48:53,343 --> 00:48:56,690
Us? How, sir? What did we do?

642
00:48:56,990 --> 00:49:00,567
This commission gave every man
in the ship's company

643
00:49:00,669 --> 00:49:03,930
the key to opportunity,
the chance to show what he's made of.

644
00:49:04,029 --> 00:49:06,646
Well, you've shown what you're made of.

645
00:49:06,748 --> 00:49:10,424
Dirt and empty silk nightcaps.

646
00:49:13,979 --> 00:49:16,498
Well, I thought I heard your voice, sir.

647
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:17,977
Good night.

648
00:49:19,161 --> 00:49:21,299
So you want full rations, do you?

649
00:49:21,369 --> 00:49:25,712
Well, I'll give you all the rations you need
to get us to Tahiti in time.

650
00:49:25,816 --> 00:49:27,311
Now get out!

651
00:49:31,095 --> 00:49:34,291
<i>"All the rations you need
to get us to Tahiti on time. "</i>

652
00:49:34,486 --> 00:49:36,874
<i>Those were Captain Bligh's words.</i>

653
00:49:37,366 --> 00:49:39,635
<i>Rations of what, he didn't say.</i>

654
00:49:40,276 --> 00:49:42,163
<i>But he soon showed us.</i>

655
00:49:42,836 --> 00:49:46,130
<i>Rations of
his favorite commodity, punishment.</i>

656
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:49,294
<i>Served up to the tune
of his favorite music,</i>

657
00:49:49,362 --> 00:49:51,849
<i>a cry of pain, a scream of agony.</i>

658
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:54,288
<i>That was the concert that played us
across three oceans</i>

659
00:49:54,354 --> 00:49:57,037
<i>as the months vanished from the calendar.</i>

660
00:49:57,138 --> 00:49:59,754
<i>And Captain Bligh's tension increased.</i>

661
00:50:24,395 --> 00:50:25,605
Three.

662
00:50:33,928 --> 00:50:37,343
Come down on deck, you clumsy lubbers!

663
00:50:38,024 --> 00:50:40,227
And that jib, hoist it taut.

664
00:50:49,636 --> 00:50:52,003
Land ho!

665
00:50:54,627 --> 00:50:57,016
Land ho!

666
00:52:01,845 --> 00:52:05,618
This island is inhabited
by over 200,000 savages.

667
00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:09,360
Eleven years ago,
when I was here with Captain Cook,

668
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,214
they were not dangerous.

669
00:52:11,283 --> 00:52:13,257
However, the natives
of the Sandwich Islands

670
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:15,117
seemed friendly enough,
but without warning,

671
00:52:15,186 --> 00:52:17,128
they turned on Captain Cook
and killed him.

672
00:52:17,202 --> 00:52:19,438
We shall take all due military precautions.

673
00:52:19,505 --> 00:52:22,635
In the event we find ourselves welcome,
you will discover that these savages

674
00:52:22,704 --> 00:52:25,965
have absolutely no conception
of ordinary morality.

675
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:30,252
And you will, no doubt,
take full advantage of their ignorance.

676
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:32,488
It is a matter
of supernatural indifference to me

677
00:52:32,558 --> 00:52:35,306
whether you contaminate the natives
or the natives contaminate you.

678
00:52:35,373 --> 00:52:38,406
I have but one concern, our mission.

679
00:52:38,477 --> 00:52:43,233
Let any one of you provoke an incident
which endangers it,

680
00:52:44,939 --> 00:52:49,411
and I shall cause that man
to curse his mother for giving him birth.

681
00:52:52,362 --> 00:52:54,401
Lee braces, Mr. Christian.

682
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,715
Stand by the anchor!

683
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:18,283
Let off.

684
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,926
Hoist out the launch. I shall want 12 men.

685
00:54:38,034 --> 00:54:40,335
- Aye, aye.
- Mr. Fryer, give them muskets.

686
00:54:40,433 --> 00:54:42,669
And arm another six men
and put them in the cutter.

687
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,776
At the first sign of treachery,
you will open fire

688
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:47,117
- and help us to retreat.
- Aye, aye, sir.

689
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:11,622
Select a work detail before you go ashore.
Advise Mr. Christian.

690
00:55:11,690 --> 00:55:14,755
If our reception is friendly,
start gathering the plants right away.

691
00:55:14,825 --> 00:55:16,713
One plant will be enough
to tell the story, sir,

692
00:55:16,777 --> 00:55:19,329
but I shall have to find a specimen
that has sprouted from the root.

693
00:55:19,401 --> 00:55:22,334
- Then instruct your men accordingly.
- Very good, sir.

694
00:56:03,967 --> 00:56:06,421
No, not as a walking stick, Brown.

695
00:56:14,364 --> 00:56:16,436
Bring the cutter in closer.

696
00:57:44,808 --> 00:57:46,215
King George?

697
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:48,770
No, Your Excellency.

698
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:52,929
But King George ordered me
to pay his compliments to King Hitihiti.

699
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:03,642
I talk you talk. I go Captain Cook.

700
00:58:04,452 --> 00:58:06,207
Visit many islands.

701
00:58:07,267 --> 00:58:10,975
You Mr. Bligh. Me Minarii.

702
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,590
I know, I remember you well.
Our island pilot, and a fine one.

703
00:58:14,656 --> 00:58:16,184
Oh, yes, very wonderful.

704
00:58:16,257 --> 00:58:18,329
Will you please tell King Hitihiti

705
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,367
that King George
sends many tokens of friendship?

706
00:58:59,767 --> 00:59:03,628
Hitihiti say, what he have,
King George want.

707
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:09,588
This is what we have come for,
Your Excellency, breadfruit.

708
00:59:14,164 --> 00:59:15,952
<i>That's right, uru.</i>

709
00:59:32,304 --> 00:59:35,336
King George wants his people
to be as strong as your people.

710
00:59:35,407 --> 00:59:37,773
He wants your breadfruit to nourish them.

711
00:59:46,155 --> 00:59:49,832
Hitihiti say take all breadfruit you want.

712
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:53,510
You are most grateful, Your Excellency.
Thank you.

713
01:00:40,864 --> 01:00:43,165
Here you are, Brownie. This is one, isn't it?

714
01:00:43,231 --> 01:00:44,757
No, no. Nothing like it.

715
01:00:44,831 --> 01:00:47,002
Brown, is that it over there?

716
01:00:48,222 --> 01:00:49,945
Right you are, sir.

717
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:51,892
Right you are.

718
01:00:52,989 --> 01:00:55,093
<i>Artocarpus incisa.</i>

719
01:00:55,806 --> 01:00:57,365
Isn't it amazing?

720
01:00:57,468 --> 01:01:00,764
Such a delicate sprig
with the power to feed a continent.

721
01:01:00,859 --> 01:01:03,313
You know, there's evidence to prove
that a diet of breadfruit

722
01:01:03,386 --> 01:01:04,979
can sustain life all by itself.

723
01:01:05,051 --> 01:01:07,253
Whose life? Not mine.

724
01:01:07,418 --> 01:01:08,595
Lay on, Mills.

725
01:01:08,697 --> 01:01:10,584
Watch your toes there.

726
01:01:31,093 --> 01:01:33,710
They're like a string of live pearls.

727
01:01:43,539 --> 01:01:46,636
- It must be some sort of game.
- Women only!

728
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:49,704
- Damn dull game.
- Oh, it has its possibilities.

729
01:01:51,216 --> 01:01:53,518
Not a single man among them.

730
01:01:53,616 --> 01:01:55,982
How many women
do you suppose are down there?

731
01:01:56,046 --> 01:01:57,061
Enough.

732
01:01:57,167 --> 01:02:00,200
Here! Do you think
we need to tell the others?

733
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:06,092
Look at those, fellows.
They're flogging the water.

734
01:02:11,564 --> 01:02:14,181
- What they do?
- Chase fish for feast.

735
01:02:14,892 --> 01:02:16,320
You like go?

736
01:02:22,729 --> 01:02:24,485
Go ask him. Go on.

737
01:02:24,553 --> 01:02:25,927
I'll ask him.

738
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:29,057
- There. Now, you see the new roots.
- I beg your pardon, sir.

739
01:02:29,127 --> 01:02:32,259
Almost like little veins, aren't they,
stretching down into the earth?

740
01:02:32,327 --> 01:02:34,563
- Would you just... For a moment, sir.
- What?

741
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:36,320
What is it, Mills?

742
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:41,213
It's a debatable point.
Some favor the longer, some the shorter.

743
01:02:41,669 --> 01:02:43,457
They're fishing, sir.

744
01:02:48,483 --> 01:02:50,490
I beg your pardon, sir,

745
01:02:50,595 --> 01:02:53,377
but seeing them down there,
working their fingers to the bones,

746
01:02:53,442 --> 01:02:55,678
well, we thought,
that is, the lads and I thought,

747
01:02:55,745 --> 01:02:59,771
that we might just, well, nip along
and give them a little hand, sir.

748
01:02:59,872 --> 01:03:01,726
Something to talk about
when we get home, sir.

749
01:03:01,792 --> 01:03:04,061
Yes, sir, considering our mission, sir.

750
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,615
Well, can we give them a hand, sir?

751
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:08,823
Yes, I think
we should all give them a hand.

752
01:03:08,895 --> 01:03:12,690
Mr. Christian, I'm ready for a man
to help me ball the root.

753
01:03:14,142 --> 01:03:16,148
- To what?
- Ball the root.

754
01:03:19,772 --> 01:03:21,201
Well...

755
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:26,745
- Mills?
- Gosh, sir, I...

756
01:03:26,811 --> 01:03:29,079
I don't know a thing about gardening, sir.

757
01:03:29,146 --> 01:03:30,772
Honest, I don't.

758
01:03:37,656 --> 01:03:38,965
Well, go on, then!

759
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:40,558
Thank you, sir.

760
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,956
- I'm ready, Mr. Christian.
- Oh, damn you, Brown! I'm coming.

761
01:04:32,844 --> 01:04:35,178
Mates! Hey, mates. What's that?

762
01:05:21,504 --> 01:05:24,854
Don't be scared.
I'm going to take you home with me.

763
01:06:26,322 --> 01:06:28,973
- Well, is it dormant, or isn't it?
- I couldn't say, sir.

764
01:06:29,042 --> 01:06:32,075
Only the transplant itself can answer you,
by living or dying.

765
01:06:32,144 --> 01:06:33,672
And when can I expect its decision?

766
01:06:33,745 --> 01:06:36,200
Perhaps 12 hours,
perhaps three weeks, sir.

767
01:06:36,304 --> 01:06:38,692
Excellent. You can't say yet.

768
01:06:38,768 --> 01:06:41,352
Perhaps 12 hours, perhaps three weeks.

769
01:06:41,583 --> 01:06:44,451
We've traveled a gardener 29,000 miles

770
01:06:44,527 --> 01:06:48,322
to be told we don't even know
the condition of the breadfruit. Excellent!

771
01:09:06,607 --> 01:09:08,744
You know, I heard that
if that bread plant dries up,

772
01:09:08,814 --> 01:09:10,275
we could be here four or five months.

773
01:09:10,349 --> 01:09:13,731
- You better pray it don't, mate.
- Pray it don't? What do you mean?

774
01:09:13,805 --> 01:09:15,746
How did you like
your voyage out here, then?

775
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:17,860
Nice? Comfortable?

776
01:09:17,932 --> 01:09:20,233
Nothing but fair and proper treatment
from the Captain, eh?

777
01:09:20,299 --> 01:09:21,542
Worst I ever remember.

778
01:09:21,611 --> 01:09:23,815
Well, what makes you
want to get underway, then?

779
01:09:23,882 --> 01:09:24,930
Use your head.

780
01:09:25,002 --> 01:09:26,910
If Captain Bligh was cooped up here
for five months,

781
01:09:26,986 --> 01:09:29,505
five months, mark you,
who do you think he'd take it out on?

782
01:09:29,577 --> 01:09:31,747
You think we sweat a bit,
making for the Horn?

783
01:09:31,816 --> 01:09:33,823
Wait till he breaks our back
making for Jamaica.

784
01:09:33,895 --> 01:09:35,302
We'll worry about that
when it comes. Here!

785
01:09:35,367 --> 01:09:36,861
- Aye.
- Might as well at that, mates.

786
01:09:36,935 --> 01:09:39,869
I wonder why they make
those women eat alone?

787
01:09:40,295 --> 01:09:42,945
Because if they didn't,
you'd be too busy to eat.

788
01:09:43,014 --> 01:09:44,126
Funny lot, aren't they?

789
01:09:44,197 --> 01:09:47,012
They let us make free with their women.
They won't let us eat with them.

790
01:09:47,077 --> 01:09:49,946
Isn't that like knocking at the wrong door?

791
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:35,796
Hitihiti say,
Captain dance with daughter now.

792
01:10:35,866 --> 01:10:37,589
Dance? No, not me.

793
01:10:37,849 --> 01:10:40,750
I thank Your Excellency, but I don't dance.

794
01:10:43,001 --> 01:10:45,683
No say no. Hitihiti angry.

795
01:10:49,622 --> 01:10:51,760
My apologies, Your Excellency.

796
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:53,619
I did not understand.

797
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:02,028
- You are amused?
- No, I hope I shall not be, sir.

798
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:05,675
But it does seem a rather difficult dance,
doesn't it?

799
01:11:05,748 --> 01:11:07,176
We shall see.

800
01:12:29,184 --> 01:12:30,592
Sorry to spoil your evening, sir,

801
01:12:30,656 --> 01:12:33,755
but you said you wished to be informed
of any development.

802
01:12:34,367 --> 01:12:36,277
It looks wilted, Brown.

803
01:12:37,054 --> 01:12:38,646
It's dead, sir.

804
01:12:40,797 --> 01:12:43,350
Might there not be
other plants that will flourish?

805
01:12:43,421 --> 01:12:46,716
Sir, this proves
that the dormant season has begun.

806
01:12:47,581 --> 01:12:49,751
Well, you did the best you could, sir.

807
01:12:49,852 --> 01:12:53,648
It's a pity the Admiralty will blame you,
in any case, for the delay.

808
01:12:53,724 --> 01:12:56,757
But, it's an unjust world. My sympathy!

809
01:13:01,338 --> 01:13:03,028
I dislike failure.

810
01:13:04,793 --> 01:13:07,661
I dislike it as much as the Admiralty does.

811
01:13:39,985 --> 01:13:43,465
Forgive me. I have a partner over there.

812
01:13:48,238 --> 01:13:50,442
Forgive me, please.

813
01:14:55,327 --> 01:14:56,504
Hello.

814
01:15:07,549 --> 01:15:10,265
Fletcher Christian is my name.

815
01:15:12,892 --> 01:15:16,852
- "Is my name."
- No, no. Fletcher.

816
01:15:19,322 --> 01:15:21,230
"No, no. Fletcher."

817
01:15:25,625 --> 01:15:26,966
All right.

818
01:15:35,095 --> 01:15:36,436
Thank you.

819
01:15:56,914 --> 01:15:58,440
How very sweet.

820
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:04,269
Now, Maimiti, if I may?

821
01:16:26,954 --> 01:16:28,677
That's a kiss!

822
01:16:29,483 --> 01:16:30,628
"Kiss."

823
01:16:31,786 --> 01:16:33,445
No, no, Fletcher.

824
01:16:34,154 --> 01:16:35,614
Yes, Fletcher.

825
01:16:36,073 --> 01:16:38,015
Yes, yes, Fletcher.

826
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:40,705
"Yes, Fletcher."

827
01:16:53,766 --> 01:16:55,227
Mr. Christian?

828
01:17:00,388 --> 01:17:01,566
You spoke, sir?

829
01:17:01,636 --> 01:17:03,806
That's the King's daughter
you're tampering with.

830
01:17:03,874 --> 01:17:06,329
You should know better
than to risk his displeasure.

831
01:17:06,402 --> 01:17:08,857
Kindly satisfy your lust elsewhere.

832
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:14,302
Quite actually, sir, we were simply
discussing the incredible variety

833
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:18,109
- of Tahitian vegetation. It was...
- Acknowledge the order.

834
01:17:21,055 --> 01:17:23,421
Lust to be satisfied elsewhere, sir!

835
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:26,551
But not today.
Report onboard, immediately.

836
01:17:32,956 --> 01:17:34,549
You bloody fool.

837
01:17:37,051 --> 01:17:39,124
Well, I'm sorry, old girl.

838
01:18:30,384 --> 01:18:31,693
Good morning.

839
01:18:33,646 --> 01:18:35,435
Thank you.
Would you like to come aboard?

840
01:18:35,502 --> 01:18:37,575
You come here.

841
01:18:41,005 --> 01:18:42,532
Yes, of course.

842
01:18:52,779 --> 01:18:56,324
You tell Captain Bligh
he not get breadfruit.

843
01:18:57,353 --> 01:18:58,847
No breadfruit?

844
01:18:59,113 --> 01:19:01,633
Last night you go away from Maimiti.

845
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:03,999
Yes, regretfully. You see, I...

846
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:07,420
Hitihiti say,
daughter not good enough for England,

847
01:19:07,527 --> 01:19:09,632
breadfruit not good enough.

848
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:13,826
Well, that's certainly
a very sound point of view.

849
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:17,088
- You tell Captain Bligh, no breadfruit.
- Yes.

850
01:19:18,468 --> 01:19:21,250
May I suggest
that you tell Captain Bligh, yourself?

851
01:19:21,316 --> 01:19:24,447
You see, I don't think
that he would believe me.

852
01:19:26,882 --> 01:19:28,856
- I tell, yes.
- Thank you.

853
01:19:37,025 --> 01:19:39,031
- Mr. Morrison?
- Aye, sir.

854
01:19:39,232 --> 01:19:41,566
Would you direct this gentleman
to Captain Bligh, please?

855
01:19:41,632 --> 01:19:43,900
Yes, sir. Please come with me.

856
01:20:26,261 --> 01:20:28,050
You sent for me, sir?

857
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:30,866
Sit down.

858
01:20:31,668 --> 01:20:34,483
A rather awkward situation has developed.

859
01:20:36,723 --> 01:20:39,209
That daughter of Hitihiti's...

860
01:20:39,923 --> 01:20:42,475
It seems he's quite attached to her.

861
01:20:43,346 --> 01:20:45,352
Yes, she's a lovely girl.

862
01:20:47,217 --> 01:20:49,583
In a civilized society,

863
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:53,388
certain lewd intentions toward
the female members of one's family

864
01:20:53,456 --> 01:20:55,397
would be regarded as...

865
01:20:55,567 --> 01:20:57,323
Well, as an insult.

866
01:20:58,094 --> 01:21:01,094
- Follow me?
- I think so, sir.

867
01:21:01,166 --> 01:21:05,572
But in Tahiti, the insult lies
in the omission of those lewd intentions.

868
01:21:05,644 --> 01:21:07,651
Manners that would offend
a dockside harlot

869
01:21:07,724 --> 01:21:11,367
seem to be the only acceptable behavior
to King Hitihiti.

870
01:21:11,915 --> 01:21:14,914
Well, it takes all sorts
to make a world, sir.

871
01:21:17,322 --> 01:21:21,030
What I'm trying to say is that
you have offended his code of etiquette.

872
01:21:23,176 --> 01:21:24,605
Well, I can assure you, sir,

873
01:21:24,681 --> 01:21:28,029
that I have done nothing
that could be construed as offensive.

874
01:21:29,671 --> 01:21:32,354
I know. I know. That's just the point.

875
01:21:34,886 --> 01:21:36,511
Which point, sir?

876
01:21:37,605 --> 01:21:41,534
The success of our mission depends upon
retaining the good will of Hitihiti.

877
01:21:43,491 --> 01:21:45,596
Well, there's no doubt of that, sir.

878
01:21:46,147 --> 01:21:47,522
Well, then.

879
01:21:50,243 --> 01:21:52,610
Well, you have my fullest attention, sir.

880
01:21:53,154 --> 01:21:55,324
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

881
01:21:56,386 --> 01:22:00,061
I'm trying to understand
exactly what it is you wish me to do, sir.

882
01:22:01,089 --> 01:22:03,739
Make love to that damn daughter of his!

883
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:09,437
Is that an order, sir?

884
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:12,380
Might I have it entered in the log?

885
01:22:12,446 --> 01:22:14,070
That will be all.

886
01:22:15,901 --> 01:22:19,161
You see, it is a rather different thing

887
01:22:19,997 --> 01:22:23,476
than being asked
to fight for one's country.

888
01:22:26,394 --> 01:22:27,954
Very well, sir.

889
01:22:32,185 --> 01:22:34,072
I'll try my best, sir.

890
01:22:42,838 --> 01:22:44,332
Thank you, sir.

891
01:22:57,555 --> 01:23:00,589
- I'll have the cutter, Mr. Fryer.
- Aye, aye, sir.

892
01:23:00,659 --> 01:23:03,659
Hold the cutter,
Mr. Christian coming aboard.

893
01:23:04,018 --> 01:23:07,213
- Shall I take you off the duty roster, sir?
- Yes.

894
01:23:07,313 --> 01:23:10,661
My commission ashore
will detain me quite some time.

895
01:23:11,185 --> 01:23:13,006
Thank you, Mr. Fryer.

896
01:23:56,103 --> 01:23:57,595
How do you do?

897
01:24:00,901 --> 01:24:02,558
No, no, Fletcher.

898
01:24:04,516 --> 01:24:05,889
Well, it's...

899
01:24:05,956 --> 01:24:08,639
I hardly know where to begin, Maimiti.

900
01:24:28,607 --> 01:24:31,127
<i>The ship's company was pleased
to have it confirmed</i>

901
01:24:31,198 --> 01:24:35,191
<i>that the Tahitians considered
lovemaking a gesture of goodwill.</i>

902
01:24:35,645 --> 01:24:37,553
<i>It may sound improbable,</i>

903
01:24:37,629 --> 01:24:40,498
<i>but do you know
the goodwill in the hearts of our crew</i>

904
01:24:40,604 --> 01:24:43,386
<i>turned out to be practically boundless.</i>

905
01:24:43,483 --> 01:24:47,476
<i>And the Tahitian ladies
gave them every opportunity to prove it.</i>

906
01:24:47,643 --> 01:24:51,471
<i>You see, to the Tahitians,
a light skin was a mark of beauty.</i>

907
01:24:52,026 --> 01:24:54,894
<i>Men with fair complexions,
like Englishmen,</i>

908
01:24:55,001 --> 01:24:57,073
<i>were regarded as beautiful.</i>

909
01:24:57,145 --> 01:25:00,722
<i>No matter how nonsensically
their features were arranged.</i>

910
01:25:00,791 --> 01:25:03,824
<i>They were beautiful
and they could do no wrong.</i>

911
01:25:03,991 --> 01:25:07,306
<i>So they did no wrong
at every possible opportunity.</i>

912
01:25:51,979 --> 01:25:54,468
- Beautiful evening, sir.
- Beautiful.

913
01:25:54,828 --> 01:25:56,584
Sounds as though
they're enjoying it ashore, sir.

914
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:58,538
- Doesn't it?
- Yes, sir.

915
01:25:59,147 --> 01:26:01,349
Forgive the liberty, Captain,

916
01:26:01,418 --> 01:26:04,581
but you have not spent one evening
ashore yourself, yet, have you?

917
01:26:04,649 --> 01:26:06,340
I don't intend to.

918
01:26:06,409 --> 01:26:10,499
It's a remarkably friendly island, sir.
It's a shame to be Ionely in this port.

919
01:26:10,567 --> 01:26:14,014
While our mission remains unfulfilled,
I'm not in any port, Mr. Fryer.

920
01:26:14,087 --> 01:26:18,658
I am in command where,
you may find one day, it's always Ionely.

921
01:26:19,366 --> 01:26:22,048
You see, command allows no intimacies.

922
01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:24,418
You can hardly expect
unquestioning obedience

923
01:26:24,485 --> 01:26:27,202
from last night's partner in a debauch.

924
01:26:27,461 --> 01:26:30,329
Suppose not, but it does seem a pity, sir.

925
01:26:31,044 --> 01:26:32,865
I prefer it that way.

926
01:26:33,379 --> 01:26:34,655
Yes, sir.

927
01:26:56,381 --> 01:26:59,926
- The men are a little slow, sir, but...
- Yes, I know.

928
01:27:00,157 --> 01:27:03,451
<i>There was only one man
who refused to take things as they came.</i>

929
01:27:03,517 --> 01:27:05,077
<i>Tahitian style.</i>

930
01:27:05,340 --> 01:27:06,768
<i>He was in love.</i>

931
01:27:06,844 --> 01:27:09,527
<i>And when you saw his girl,
it was hard to blame him.</i>

932
01:27:09,595 --> 01:27:12,212
<i>But Tahitian-style love wasn't for him.</i>

933
01:27:12,281 --> 01:27:15,314
<i>He wanted things ship-shape
in Bristol fashion.</i>

934
01:27:15,418 --> 01:27:18,613
<i>So he went to Captain Bligh
and asked to be married.</i>

935
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:22,030
<i>Well, I had seen Bligh every day
for more than a year.</i>

936
01:27:22,455 --> 01:27:25,554
<i>And that was the only time
I ever saw him laugh.</i>

937
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:34,387
Midshipmen. Be a dull navy without them.

938
01:27:34,837 --> 01:27:37,105
Now get that slut off my ship.

939
01:27:50,513 --> 01:27:52,815
He didn't have to put it
to the boy like that.

940
01:27:52,882 --> 01:27:53,994
The old pig.

941
01:27:54,065 --> 01:27:56,650
His shadow don't fit his shape,
not by a damn sight.

942
01:27:56,721 --> 01:27:58,377
Well, expect it to grow horns.

943
01:27:58,447 --> 01:28:01,959
You will, Quintal.
You'll see it, after we lift anchor.

944
01:28:03,470 --> 01:28:06,339
If I be a judge,
a man would beg to settle for the cat

945
01:28:06,446 --> 01:28:08,834
- even before we see Jamaica.
- Aye.

946
01:28:19,883 --> 01:28:21,606
You know something?

947
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:27,046
A man could have
a fine life for himself out here.

948
01:28:34,952 --> 01:28:36,806
My word, how lovely.

949
01:28:36,903 --> 01:28:38,464
Just exquisite.

950
01:28:39,304 --> 01:28:41,920
Beautiful work. Oh, isn't that jolly.

951
01:28:47,876 --> 01:28:49,153
Maimiti.

952
01:28:49,989 --> 01:28:53,762
Oh, yes. Would you excuse me? Please?
I want to say goodbye to her.

953
01:28:53,827 --> 01:28:56,095
Tell King George, send for me.

954
01:28:56,514 --> 01:28:58,336
I am good Englishman.

955
01:28:58,754 --> 01:29:02,399
I have plenty breadfruit, plenty hog.
Feed all England.

956
01:29:02,465 --> 01:29:06,556
Yes. Well, he's certainly in need of hogs.
And I'll tell him the first time I see him.

957
01:29:06,624 --> 01:29:07,966
Would you excuse me?

958
01:29:08,033 --> 01:29:09,374
Thank you.

959
01:29:25,212 --> 01:29:28,146
Well, Maimiti, it's time.

960
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:32,313
I'll be leaving in a few hours.

961
01:29:35,546 --> 01:29:36,821
I wait.

962
01:29:36,890 --> 01:29:40,947
I wait you, Fletcher.
I look for you every day.

963
01:29:42,297 --> 01:29:45,809
Maimiti, there must be some way
to make you understand

964
01:29:45,912 --> 01:29:47,733
that I won't be back.

965
01:29:48,151 --> 01:29:50,540
And if you look for me,
you'll only be unhappy,

966
01:29:50,614 --> 01:29:52,654
and I wouldn't like that.

967
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:56,364
Never come back to me?

968
01:29:56,469 --> 01:29:59,600
Never come back to Tahiti. One time?

969
01:30:05,811 --> 01:30:06,858
No.

970
01:30:10,418 --> 01:30:12,141
But I'll remember.

971
01:30:14,097 --> 01:30:15,504
You see...

972
01:30:19,761 --> 01:30:22,061
I've been happy here, Maimiti.

973
01:30:24,238 --> 01:30:25,765
I'll remember you,

974
01:30:27,342 --> 01:30:30,058
and the lovely time we've had together.

975
01:30:31,373 --> 01:30:33,576
Your sweet face, your beauty.

976
01:30:39,243 --> 01:30:41,282
But England is my home,

977
01:30:44,298 --> 01:30:46,534
and it's time to say goodbye.

978
01:30:47,593 --> 01:30:49,154
I must go.

979
01:30:51,368 --> 01:30:52,645
Goodbye.

980
01:30:58,151 --> 01:31:01,281
Goodbye, Maimiti. Take care.

981
01:31:19,491 --> 01:31:23,484
Well, that just about does it, sir.
These 20 and we're all done.

982
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:43,193
There they are.

983
01:31:45,181 --> 01:31:46,806
They've got the boat, like they said.

984
01:31:46,876 --> 01:31:50,192
- What if we're caught?
- Look, we've been over that often enough.

985
01:31:50,267 --> 01:31:52,536
Captured deserters hang,
but we won't be caught.

986
01:31:52,602 --> 01:31:54,130
I wish I could be sure of it.

987
01:31:54,201 --> 01:31:57,300
Why don't you stop shilly-shallying
and come on.

988
01:32:26,451 --> 01:32:29,418
I'm sorry to be a bore, Ned,
but your work party's gone dallying,

989
01:32:29,492 --> 01:32:31,345
and Mr. Fryer's on his way.

990
01:32:31,410 --> 01:32:33,646
I think you'd look rather graceless
being bent over a cannon,

991
01:32:33,713 --> 01:32:36,299
so I suggest that we go collect them.

992
01:32:59,468 --> 01:33:00,646
Idiots.

993
01:33:12,938 --> 01:33:14,498
Hello, Minarii!

994
01:33:30,693 --> 01:33:32,481
Overtake that canoe.

995
01:33:32,837 --> 01:33:34,778
They'll need a strong wind to outrun us.

996
01:33:34,852 --> 01:33:37,600
Well, they'll not find one
this side of the reef.

997
01:34:17,308 --> 01:34:21,397
- No, not that passage. We'll capsize!
- Not enough time. We've got to chance it.

998
01:35:45,510 --> 01:35:47,811
Quite an interesting gathering.

999
01:35:49,446 --> 01:35:52,064
What are those deserters doing here?

1000
01:35:52,326 --> 01:35:56,797
- Why aren't these men in irons?
- The men are being bandaged, sir.

1001
01:35:57,540 --> 01:36:01,433
And as to whether they are deserters,
I'm a naval officer, I'm not a judge.

1002
01:36:01,539 --> 01:36:04,887
To my mind, you are neither.
Confine them in the cable tier.

1003
01:36:04,962 --> 01:36:07,133
Release them for duty only.

1004
01:36:08,897 --> 01:36:10,620
We haven't been heard, sir.

1005
01:36:10,689 --> 01:36:14,517
- Haven't we got the right to be heard, sir?
- Oh, yes. Indeed you have.

1006
01:36:14,625 --> 01:36:16,053
At your court martial in Jamaica,

1007
01:36:16,127 --> 01:36:18,810
you may be heard
right up to the moment you hang.

1008
01:36:20,382 --> 01:36:23,034
- Did you say cable tier, sir?
- In irons.

1009
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:31,188
Six weeks in that stinking, filthy hole

1010
01:36:31,260 --> 01:36:34,293
and there won't be
enough left of them to hang.

1011
01:36:34,653 --> 01:36:36,540
I wonder why an alleged gentleman

1012
01:36:36,603 --> 01:36:39,831
should give his first loyalty
to ordinary seaman.

1013
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:42,967
Instead of to other alleged gentleman?

1014
01:36:43,577 --> 01:36:46,227
Impertinence noted. It shall be logged.

1015
01:36:46,329 --> 01:36:48,749
Do you care to enlarge the entry?

1016
01:36:49,719 --> 01:36:51,791
Yes. Only with this observation,

1017
01:36:51,896 --> 01:36:55,124
which I will report to the Admiralty,
in any case.

1018
01:36:55,446 --> 01:36:57,748
In my years of service,
I have never met an officer

1019
01:36:57,815 --> 01:37:01,675
who inflicted punishment upon men
with such incredible relish.

1020
01:37:02,486 --> 01:37:04,046
It's sickening.

1021
01:37:04,436 --> 01:37:07,599
Then go and be sick in your cabin,
Mr. Christian.

1022
01:37:08,085 --> 01:37:12,274
I have never met a naval officer
who was so proud of a weak stomach!

1023
01:37:40,877 --> 01:37:42,632
They forgot to take our knives.

1024
01:37:42,701 --> 01:37:45,035
- They don't cut iron, do they?
- No. But they cut throats.

1025
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:47,401
And I ain't going to live to hang. Not me.

1026
01:37:47,467 --> 01:37:50,663
- No, no, no. Don't be hasty.
- What's to wait for?

1027
01:37:52,234 --> 01:37:54,983
- We're finished.
- Most likely are, yes.

1028
01:37:55,497 --> 01:37:58,595
But I don't intend cutting my throat.
Not yet, that is.

1029
01:37:58,665 --> 01:38:02,658
No? I suppose the angel of mercy
is going to step out of a cloud and say,

1030
01:38:02,759 --> 01:38:07,166
"Captain Bligh, set those nice lads free.
And kindly be smart about it."

1031
01:38:07,558 --> 01:38:09,696
Something like that, yes. Yes.

1032
01:38:09,799 --> 01:38:12,318
Only, we're not the only people
onboard this ship

1033
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:14,462
who can't swallow
much more of Mr. Bligh.

1034
01:38:14,533 --> 01:38:16,288
Ah, you're grasping at straws.

1035
01:38:16,356 --> 01:38:19,226
Who's gonna chuck him overboard?
This crew?

1036
01:38:19,331 --> 01:38:21,982
It wasn't the crew I was thinking of.

1037
01:38:22,212 --> 01:38:25,177
- Who then?
- Christian.

1038
01:38:26,306 --> 01:38:27,801
Mr. Christian.

1039
01:38:28,737 --> 01:38:30,428
He came after us and caught us, didn't he?

1040
01:38:30,498 --> 01:38:32,438
- It showed whose side he's on.
- Aye!

1041
01:38:32,513 --> 01:38:35,163
It showed he was a King's Officer,
that's all.

1042
01:38:35,264 --> 01:38:38,909
But I hope Bligh keeps pushing him,
like he did just now.

1043
01:38:39,263 --> 01:38:41,532
Christian will turn on him.

1044
01:38:42,912 --> 01:38:44,820
I know what he's thinking.

1045
01:38:44,707 --> 01:38:46,665
I can see it in his face.

1046
01:38:47,018 --> 01:38:49,677
And I do not intend to let him forget it.

1047
01:38:58,099 --> 01:39:00,968
<i>Five months we'd spent in Tahiti.</i>

1048
01:39:01,074 --> 01:39:03,495
<i>They seemed more like five minutes.</i>

1049
01:39:04,594 --> 01:39:07,212
<i>The day of departure
would have been a black one for me,</i>

1050
01:39:07,281 --> 01:39:09,616
<i>as it was for everyone but Captain Bligh,</i>

1051
01:39:09,713 --> 01:39:12,430
<i>except that I didn't have a minute
to dwell on it.</i>

1052
01:39:12,497 --> 01:39:15,213
<i>The Bounty had become
a sea-going greenhouse</i>

1053
01:39:15,312 --> 01:39:18,311
<i>with over a thousand potted plants
to be tended.</i>

1054
01:39:18,384 --> 01:39:20,326
<i>Captain Bligh had doubled our quota,</i>

1055
01:39:20,399 --> 01:39:22,635
<i>thinking to please
the West Indies Company</i>

1056
01:39:22,702 --> 01:39:24,906
<i>and make amends for his tardiness.</i>

1057
01:39:24,974 --> 01:39:28,869
<i>Aboard ship, there is a danger
in having too much of anything,</i>

1058
01:39:28,974 --> 01:39:32,748
<i>for then one is bound to have
too little of something else.</i>

1059
01:39:45,066 --> 01:39:46,691
Go along, Mills.

1060
01:40:11,271 --> 01:40:12,547
Oh, dear.

1061
01:40:14,373 --> 01:40:16,129
Our first casualty.

1062
01:40:16,421 --> 01:40:19,519
But we must resign ourselves
to losing a great many of them, sir.

1063
01:40:19,588 --> 01:40:22,402
There's just no way to stretch the water.

1064
01:40:32,962 --> 01:40:36,223
- We don't have enough water?
- In the ordinary way, plenty, sir.

1065
01:40:36,289 --> 01:40:39,736
But indoors, in this heat,
they need twice the amount.

1066
01:40:55,966 --> 01:40:58,453
But they would all live
if they had the extra ration?

1067
01:40:58,525 --> 01:40:59,769
Why, of course.

1068
01:40:59,837 --> 01:41:01,625
But I measured the kegs
most carefully, sir,

1069
01:41:01,693 --> 01:41:04,540
- and there just isn't enough...
- Yes, yes!

1070
01:41:07,739 --> 01:41:10,489
Give them all the water they need, Brown.

1071
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:13,394
We'll not have another dead plant.

1072
01:41:13,659 --> 01:41:16,789
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

1073
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:26,451
Fourteen degrees, 37 minutes.

1074
01:41:32,119 --> 01:41:33,526
Belay that!

1075
01:41:36,087 --> 01:41:38,836
- And stow it away.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1076
01:41:40,694 --> 01:41:42,603
- Mr. Christian?
- Yes, sir.

1077
01:41:42,677 --> 01:41:45,611
I'll have a sentry posted at the water cask,
if you please.

1078
01:41:45,684 --> 01:41:46,764
Aye, aye, sir.

1079
01:41:46,836 --> 01:41:49,586
I want this slung
from the main t'gallant yardarm.

1080
01:41:49,685 --> 01:41:52,434
Any man desiring water
will climb and fetch it.

1081
01:41:52,531 --> 01:41:55,662
He may have just as much
as this ladle holds and no more.

1082
01:41:55,763 --> 01:41:58,445
Then he will replace the ladle
at the yardarm.

1083
01:41:58,514 --> 01:42:00,619
Are we short of water, sir?

1084
01:42:00,913 --> 01:42:05,255
- Do you wish me to repeat the order?
- No, sir. It's perfectly clear.

1085
01:42:05,712 --> 01:42:08,047
- A bit bewildering, but clear.
- Then do it.

1086
01:42:08,113 --> 01:42:11,461
Don't think about it.
Thinking seems to confuse you.

1087
01:42:15,727 --> 01:42:17,963
You go down and I'll follow.

1088
01:42:27,117 --> 01:42:30,532
All the way to the main t'gallant yardarm
for that spoonful of water, eh?

1089
01:42:30,605 --> 01:42:32,971
Yeah. A man would sweat more
than he can drink, wouldn't he?

1090
01:42:33,036 --> 01:42:35,490
That's a fine way to murder a fellow.

1091
01:42:36,875 --> 01:42:38,052
Mills?

1092
01:42:40,426 --> 01:42:41,702
Yes, sir?

1093
01:42:42,058 --> 01:42:43,552
If you feel free to speak disrespectfully

1094
01:42:43,626 --> 01:42:45,186
because you think
you've nothing more to lose,

1095
01:42:45,257 --> 01:42:46,598
you'd best think again.

1096
01:42:46,665 --> 01:42:48,073
The Captain may have a surprise for you.

1097
01:42:48,137 --> 01:42:50,624
Yes, sir. Yes, indeed, sir. He'll surprise me.

1098
01:42:50,697 --> 01:42:52,868
He'll surprise me
if he doesn't kill half the ship's company

1099
01:42:52,936 --> 01:42:55,652
before we get to Jamaica. Mark me, sir.

1100
01:43:00,295 --> 01:43:04,189
- I'll overlook what I heard this time, Mills.
- Thank you, sir.

1101
01:43:09,669 --> 01:43:11,578
- Birkett?
- Sir.

1102
01:43:12,709 --> 01:43:14,334
Take this aloft.

1103
01:43:15,556 --> 01:43:17,050
Aye, aye, sir.

1104
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:40,346
- What's the matter with him?
- He's got a touch of fever.

1105
01:43:40,416 --> 01:43:43,001
I told the bos'n. He said, sweat it out.

1106
01:43:43,102 --> 01:43:46,582
- I'll be all right if I get some water.
- Who wouldn't?

1107
01:43:46,654 --> 01:43:50,298
He hasn't had a drop in two days.
He is too weak to climb.

1108
01:43:50,654 --> 01:43:53,785
Why didn't you speak up?
I'll get the ladle for you.

1109
01:43:53,854 --> 01:43:57,082
It's against orders. I've tried it.
Every man's got to fetch his own.

1110
01:43:57,148 --> 01:43:58,642
Sick men, too?

1111
01:43:59,612 --> 01:44:01,816
Well, that a kindly rule.

1112
01:44:02,011 --> 01:44:04,694
I'll go daft. I've got to get a drink.

1113
01:44:18,041 --> 01:44:20,724
Brown, you must know
that's unnecessary.

1114
01:44:21,143 --> 01:44:22,769
Drink all the water you need, Brown.

1115
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:25,621
Don't try to climb the shrouds,
you don't know how.

1116
01:44:25,686 --> 01:44:29,331
If I may be allowed a protest, sir.
It's a matter of self-respect.

1117
01:44:29,399 --> 01:44:32,529
Damn your self-respect!
I'll not lose my gardener.

1118
01:44:32,598 --> 01:44:34,638
Damn my self-respect, sir?

1119
01:44:35,285 --> 01:44:37,619
Then, indeed, would I be damned.

1120
01:44:51,762 --> 01:44:55,439
I hope you're satisfied.
The masthead is no place for novices.

1121
01:44:55,538 --> 01:44:57,905
- Even a qualified hand...
- You murdering fool!

1122
01:44:57,969 --> 01:45:00,718
I'll tear your throat out of you. You...

1123
01:45:06,607 --> 01:45:09,923
Mr. Fryer, this man will be keelhauled.

1124
01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:15,690
We'll give him tonight to think about it,
and keelhaul him in the morning.

1125
01:45:16,238 --> 01:45:18,343
Take him below and put him in irons.

1126
01:45:18,445 --> 01:45:20,681
Birkett, Norton, lend a hand.

1127
01:46:13,955 --> 01:46:15,133
One.

1128
01:46:17,026 --> 01:46:20,189
One? Yes, that's correct, Mills.

1129
01:46:21,602 --> 01:46:23,008
One more bit of insolence

1130
01:46:23,074 --> 01:46:26,106
and you'll wish
that you'd fallen to the deck.

1131
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:34,261
Fletcher, you heard him.
He can't do such a thing, can he?

1132
01:46:34,336 --> 01:46:37,913
Hereafter, you will announce yourself
with a knock, if you don't mind.

1133
01:46:37,983 --> 01:46:40,950
You don't deceive me, Fletcher.
You feel the same way as I do.

1134
01:46:41,022 --> 01:46:43,868
Why, he's monstrous.
I believe he's insane!

1135
01:46:43,934 --> 01:46:46,170
He's the headmaster, over-fond of caning.

1136
01:46:46,237 --> 01:46:48,725
And you're the third former
who can do nothing about it,

1137
01:46:48,798 --> 01:46:50,739
except to bleat
and to beat your head against the wall.

1138
01:46:50,813 --> 01:46:52,242
Now, stop being a nuisance.

1139
01:46:52,317 --> 01:46:55,698
You're not going to patronize me
about this, Fletcher, midshipman or no.

1140
01:46:55,771 --> 01:46:58,585
You must protest, Fletcher,
keelhauling is illegal!

1141
01:46:58,651 --> 01:47:01,039
It's tantamount to executing the fellow.

1142
01:47:01,146 --> 01:47:03,033
Well, what a champion
of the obvious you are.

1143
01:47:03,098 --> 01:47:04,439
Of course, he's executing the fellow.

1144
01:47:04,506 --> 01:47:07,156
What do you suppose my punishment
would be, were I to strike a captain?

1145
01:47:07,225 --> 01:47:10,521
Well, you know very well you should be
hanged, but that's not the point.

1146
01:47:10,585 --> 01:47:13,454
Well, that's exactly the point.
Now, just ask yourself.

1147
01:47:13,529 --> 01:47:15,917
Why should a common seaman
receive a lesser punishment

1148
01:47:15,992 --> 01:47:17,846
for exactly the same offense?

1149
01:47:17,944 --> 01:47:20,791
That doesn't alter the fact
that keelhauling is illegal.

1150
01:47:20,855 --> 01:47:23,724
Even a common seaman's
entitled to a trial.

1151
01:47:24,790 --> 01:47:27,058
Take a pew. I'll have you a go at chess.

1152
01:47:27,126 --> 01:47:30,442
You can have the white.
It might improve your game.

1153
01:47:31,093 --> 01:47:33,482
Oh, come off it, Ned, sit down.

1154
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:30,363
The line's gone slack, sir.

1155
01:49:30,911 --> 01:49:32,155
Haul in.

1156
01:49:43,165 --> 01:49:45,619
There's nothing left to haul, sir.

1157
01:49:46,011 --> 01:49:47,801
Then cast him loose.

1158
01:49:54,075 --> 01:49:56,147
Get her under sail, again.

1159
01:50:02,361 --> 01:50:04,782
- Mr. Fryer?
- Sir.

1160
01:50:06,552 --> 01:50:09,236
- Headsails and courses.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1161
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:11,952
Set headsail and courses!

1162
01:50:12,887 --> 01:50:14,894
Set headsail and courses.

1163
01:50:15,223 --> 01:50:16,913
Aye, aye, sir!

1164
01:50:16,982 --> 01:50:19,502
All hands make sail!

1165
01:50:21,142 --> 01:50:23,694
Set headsails and courses!

1166
01:50:29,557 --> 01:50:31,051
Man the tacks!

1167
01:50:38,675 --> 01:50:40,616
Man the braces!

1168
01:50:52,720 --> 01:50:53,832
Two.

1169
01:52:27,679 --> 01:52:30,809
- Would you care for a drink?
- No, thank you.

1170
01:52:34,845 --> 01:52:36,306
Well, what are you standing there for?

1171
01:52:36,381 --> 01:52:40,155
Did you come down here to watch
my Adam's apple bob about while I drink?

1172
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:42,005
No, I'm thirsty.

1173
01:52:43,164 --> 01:52:47,288
- Well, take some water, then.
- I couldn't. I couldn't get it down.

1174
01:52:48,155 --> 01:52:50,227
Puking hell, you're a bore!

1175
01:52:52,155 --> 01:52:53,845
Is it a bore to want to help men

1176
01:52:53,914 --> 01:52:56,848
whose lives are being torn out of them
by a madman?

1177
01:52:56,921 --> 01:52:58,960
Why don't you have the carpenter
build you a cross,

1178
01:52:59,033 --> 01:53:01,454
so you can drag it about the ship
and put ashes on your head?

1179
01:53:01,528 --> 01:53:03,382
That would suit you, wouldn't it?

1180
01:53:03,448 --> 01:53:04,560
I've known you all my life,

1181
01:53:04,632 --> 01:53:06,900
but I've never really known you
till this moment.

1182
01:53:06,968 --> 01:53:09,172
You're just exactly what you seem to be.

1183
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:10,832
A supercilious poseur

1184
01:53:10,935 --> 01:53:14,033
without the slightest trace of humanity
or compassion.

1185
01:53:14,647 --> 01:53:17,134
Are you quite finished
with your impertinence?

1186
01:53:17,206 --> 01:53:18,220
Not quite.

1187
01:53:18,326 --> 01:53:22,187
One needn't look further for your character
than the pomade in your hair.

1188
01:53:24,244 --> 01:53:27,725
You'll close your arrogant mouth,
Mr. Midshipman Young.

1189
01:53:28,468 --> 01:53:30,671
Or I'll have you on the rack.

1190
01:53:31,763 --> 01:53:33,999
That's a promise and an order.

1191
01:53:34,322 --> 01:53:35,915
Close that cask.

1192
01:53:40,433 --> 01:53:42,472
Damn your blood, close it!

1193
01:54:04,141 --> 01:54:05,864
Grab him, somebody.

1194
01:54:06,380 --> 01:54:08,617
The Captain! The Captain!

1195
01:54:08,908 --> 01:54:11,755
Oh, the water in the sea!

1196
01:54:12,236 --> 01:54:14,275
I told her I would leave!

1197
01:54:15,339 --> 01:54:16,713
Where is he?

1198
01:54:17,387 --> 01:54:18,848
Where is he?

1199
01:54:19,914 --> 01:54:24,256
If it comes, I'll swim down
to where it's cold and dark.

1200
01:54:26,504 --> 01:54:29,407
Never dry, where it's cold.

1201
01:54:29,513 --> 01:54:31,814
The damn fool's been drinking seawater.

1202
01:54:31,912 --> 01:54:33,734
- Are you certain?
- We caught him at it.

1203
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:36,766
He's got a bucket of bilge water
hidden in the storeroom.

1204
01:54:36,838 --> 01:54:39,107
Must have been at it for days.

1205
01:54:39,654 --> 01:54:41,661
Well, you'd best bind him, then.

1206
01:54:41,734 --> 01:54:44,548
He won't be in his right head for a while
if he lives.

1207
01:54:44,613 --> 01:54:46,685
Lives? He hasn't got a chance, sir.

1208
01:54:46,789 --> 01:54:49,156
Not without sweet water
to wash out his guts.

1209
01:54:49,221 --> 01:54:51,642
- Give me his hands.
- Well, can't he have it, sir?

1210
01:54:51,716 --> 01:54:54,814
That's impossible, Quintal.
You know the Captain's orders.

1211
01:54:56,899 --> 01:54:59,233
Up he goes. Up he goes.

1212
01:55:01,314 --> 01:55:03,583
I got to go home. It's late.

1213
01:55:07,074 --> 01:55:09,495
The dinner is ruined. It's ruined.

1214
01:55:09,570 --> 01:55:11,773
The meat's burned to a crisp.

1215
01:55:12,737 --> 01:55:15,224
Oh, what a tongue that woman's got,

1216
01:55:16,576 --> 01:55:18,430
but she's a good sort.

1217
01:55:21,343 --> 01:55:24,888
You know, I'm not the easiest man
in the world to get along with.

1218
01:55:24,989 --> 01:55:26,102
Steady, man.

1219
01:55:26,173 --> 01:55:28,279
I've got a terrible temper.

1220
01:55:36,412 --> 01:55:39,640
- Three, Mr. Christian?
- Get out of my way, Mills.

1221
01:55:41,658 --> 01:55:43,087
Oh, he goes.

1222
01:56:02,359 --> 01:56:04,595
Here's the great face reader.

1223
01:56:05,302 --> 01:56:08,564
That's a rare gift you have,
for being wrong.

1224
01:56:08,663 --> 01:56:12,655
Leave him be.
At least, he did give us some hope.

1225
01:56:12,885 --> 01:56:14,990
All the mad waters for me.

1226
01:56:15,093 --> 01:56:18,126
- He should be below, out of the sun.
- I'll ask.

1227
01:56:22,963 --> 01:56:25,003
That mainmast needs attention, Mr. Fryer.

1228
01:56:25,075 --> 01:56:26,601
Aye, aye, sir.

1229
01:56:37,361 --> 01:56:41,670
Mr. Christian,
kindly give me an explanation.

1230
01:56:51,086 --> 01:56:53,388
Williams has been drinking seawater, sir.

1231
01:56:53,454 --> 01:56:55,842
I was giving him some freshwater.

1232
01:56:56,429 --> 01:56:58,795
I'm afraid he'll die without it.

1233
01:56:59,245 --> 01:57:02,146
You'll give no one water
without my permission.

1234
01:57:02,252 --> 01:57:05,600
- Take that ladle below.
- Yes, sir.

1235
01:57:34,503 --> 01:57:36,706
You bloody bastard!

1236
01:57:37,478 --> 01:57:40,063
You'll not put your foot on me again.

1237
01:57:45,284 --> 01:57:48,350
Thank you. Thank you.

1238
01:57:48,580 --> 01:57:51,547
I've been puzzling for a means
to take the strut out of you,

1239
01:57:51,620 --> 01:57:53,343
you posturing snob.

1240
01:57:54,978 --> 01:57:57,847
Now, you've solved that for me,
haven't you?

1241
01:57:58,946 --> 01:58:03,734
You have witnessed Mr. Christian's
act of violence toward a superior officer.

1242
01:58:03,841 --> 01:58:07,190
He will be placed in confinement
until a court martial can be convened.

1243
01:58:07,265 --> 01:58:09,053
In Jamaica, I expect.

1244
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:13,528
And will your fashionable friends
be there to see your execution, I wonder?

1245
01:58:13,631 --> 01:58:15,191
Let's hope so.

1246
01:58:15,263 --> 01:58:18,110
Pity if your last function
were to be a social failure.

1247
01:58:18,174 --> 01:58:20,213
Mr. Fryer, take him below.

1248
01:58:30,300 --> 01:58:34,009
Ship's company!
I'm taking command of this ship.

1249
01:58:34,395 --> 01:58:36,467
Mr. Fryer, I'll have the keys
to the arms chest.

1250
01:58:36,539 --> 01:58:38,611
You'll give him nothing!

1251
01:58:38,714 --> 01:58:40,721
Go below and arm the men off watch.

1252
01:58:40,794 --> 01:58:42,898
Stay where you are, Fryer!

1253
01:58:43,193 --> 01:58:46,543
You've given your last command, Bligh.
I'll have those keys, Fryer.

1254
01:58:46,617 --> 01:58:48,340
You heard my order!

1255
01:58:52,632 --> 01:58:56,788
One more order, Mr. Bligh,
and I'll have your head on this deck.

1256
01:58:56,855 --> 01:58:58,796
By Heaven, I swear it!

1257
01:58:58,903 --> 01:59:00,244
Don't, sir.

1258
01:59:02,709 --> 01:59:04,465
- Mills!
- Right, sir.

1259
01:59:05,589 --> 01:59:08,240
Go below and issue arms
to all those who are with us.

1260
01:59:08,310 --> 01:59:09,738
- Byrne!
- Aye.

1261
01:59:10,229 --> 01:59:13,327
It is pointless to incite a mutiny,
Mr. Christian.

1262
01:59:13,428 --> 01:59:15,664
It cannot succeed and you know it.

1263
01:59:15,732 --> 01:59:17,422
Quintal, stop him!

1264
01:59:21,938 --> 01:59:25,353
Stop Mills in the arms room.
They're trying to take over the ship.

1265
01:59:25,457 --> 01:59:27,913
- There's a mutiny!
- Look out, Mills!

1266
01:59:48,942 --> 01:59:51,210
Your mutiny has not succeeded.

1267
01:59:54,252 --> 01:59:58,212
Perhaps not. But success enough
when it puts an end to you.

1268
02:00:01,195 --> 02:00:02,755
Mr. Christian!

1269
02:00:05,354 --> 02:00:07,809
The men are armed, Mr. Christian!

1270
02:00:07,915 --> 02:00:10,248
Come on. Come on, McCoy, get them up!

1271
02:00:10,314 --> 02:00:12,680
- I'm with you.
- Come on in there!

1272
02:00:14,441 --> 02:00:15,718
Johnson!

1273
02:00:17,417 --> 02:00:20,067
Anybody else here with us? Well?

1274
02:00:20,935 --> 02:00:22,277
Take over.

1275
02:00:23,719 --> 02:00:24,929
Mills!

1276
02:00:28,839 --> 02:00:31,359
Come on, move. Move, I said.

1277
02:00:32,166 --> 02:00:35,035
Come on. Come on. Come on, move!

1278
02:00:38,085 --> 02:00:39,907
The ship is ours, sir.

1279
02:00:40,484 --> 02:00:43,036
Very well. Guard him well, Quintal.

1280
02:00:43,427 --> 02:00:45,434
Brown, go fetch my nautical tables
and sextant.

1281
02:00:45,507 --> 02:00:47,417
The left end of the shelf, my cabin.

1282
02:00:47,491 --> 02:00:49,595
- Birkett!
- You, too, Brown?

1283
02:00:49,731 --> 02:00:51,640
You'd join these swine?

1284
02:00:52,482 --> 02:00:55,515
A man like yourself, sir,
leaves me no choice.

1285
02:00:55,873 --> 02:00:57,847
Swine, are we?
Let's have him on the grating.

1286
02:00:57,921 --> 02:00:59,546
I want medical supplies and a compass.

1287
02:00:59,616 --> 02:01:01,885
All right, boys! Let's tie him up, then.

1288
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:04,439
- All right, grab him. Pull him over there!
- Tie him up!

1289
02:01:04,511 --> 02:01:06,421
- Push him!
- Mills, hold that!

1290
02:01:06,687 --> 02:01:08,989
Get him over there. Tie him up.

1291
02:01:10,239 --> 02:01:11,929
Stand away, here!

1292
02:01:13,310 --> 02:01:15,252
They'll be no more killing aboard this ship.

1293
02:01:15,325 --> 02:01:17,976
Let's kill him now and get it done with,
right, men?

1294
02:01:18,045 --> 02:01:20,248
I'm in command of this ship!

1295
02:01:20,413 --> 02:01:24,024
If there's a man amongst you
who doubts that, let me hear his voice.

1296
02:01:26,684 --> 02:01:28,505
There'll be no more killing
aboard this ship,

1297
02:01:28,571 --> 02:01:30,393
not even Captain Bligh.

1298
02:01:30,491 --> 02:01:33,786
If that's an attempt to earn clemency,
I spit on it.

1299
02:01:34,650 --> 02:01:36,341
You remarkable pig.

1300
02:01:37,049 --> 02:01:39,056
You can thank
whatever pig-god you pray to

1301
02:01:39,129 --> 02:01:41,998
that you haven't quite turned me
into a murderer.

1302
02:01:43,608 --> 02:01:46,510
Now then, Quintal, Birkett,

1303
02:01:46,744 --> 02:01:49,777
hold him at the gangway.
Mills, come with me.

1304
02:01:52,631 --> 02:01:56,111
Mack, go below
and fetch Mr. Bligh's personal effects.

1305
02:01:56,566 --> 02:01:58,093
Ship's company!

1306
02:01:59,957 --> 02:02:03,023
I'm putting Mr. Bligh
and his party in the longboat.

1307
02:02:03,124 --> 02:02:05,709
He can make the island of Tafoa
in two days.

1308
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:08,366
If there are any among you
who wish to join him,

1309
02:02:08,436 --> 02:02:10,258
stand by the gangway.

1310
02:02:11,603 --> 02:02:12,912
Mills.

1311
02:02:17,874 --> 02:02:19,215
Mr. Fryer?

1312
02:02:20,081 --> 02:02:22,797
You understand
that it wasn't my wish to harm you.

1313
02:02:22,865 --> 02:02:26,028
- I hope that you weren't injured.
- No, not at all.

1314
02:02:26,096 --> 02:02:28,398
- May I get my gear?
- Certainly.

1315
02:02:29,712 --> 02:02:32,581
- Goodbye, Mr. Fryer.
- Goodbye, Mr. Christian.

1316
02:02:32,656 --> 02:02:36,233
- I'm sorry for you. May God help you.
- Thank you.

1317
02:02:38,734 --> 02:02:41,865
Provisions aboard
and ready to lower away, sir!

1318
02:02:43,277 --> 02:02:44,553
Lower away.

1319
02:02:44,621 --> 02:02:47,305
- Here you are, Mr. Christian.
- Stand by.

1320
02:02:48,173 --> 02:02:50,441
He's sane enough
to drink all the water he's given.

1321
02:02:50,508 --> 02:02:52,613
I think he's coming around.

1322
02:02:53,036 --> 02:02:55,337
Fletcher, I'm proud to be with you.

1323
02:02:55,436 --> 02:02:59,363
Well, you've done rather well, Ned.
Being promoted to the rank of criminal.

1324
02:02:59,467 --> 02:03:01,768
Not even 20
and a death sentence on your head.

1325
02:03:01,834 --> 02:03:03,328
Take him below.

1326
02:03:04,137 --> 02:03:05,543
By your leave, sir.

1327
02:03:06,056 --> 02:03:08,708
Well, we've been talking it over, sir.

1328
02:03:09,513 --> 02:03:12,960
- And...
- Well, what? Well, get on with it.

1329
02:03:13,064 --> 02:03:15,366
Well, we'd like to be with you, sir.
But we've got families.

1330
02:03:15,432 --> 02:03:18,944
- Well, join the party at the gangway.
- Thank you, sir.

1331
02:03:30,661 --> 02:03:33,115
As you know,
Tafoa is due west, 40 leagues.

1332
02:03:33,221 --> 02:03:36,002
You have your compass.
This book is sufficient for its purpose.

1333
02:03:36,068 --> 02:03:39,362
The sextant is my own,
so you know it to be a good one.

1334
02:03:39,459 --> 02:03:41,214
Now, Mr. William Bligh...

1335
02:03:41,283 --> 02:03:43,649
Quite polite and formal, are we?

1336
02:03:44,801 --> 02:03:47,933
Playing the gentleman again,
you bloody traitor.

1337
02:03:51,585 --> 02:03:52,926
Mr. Fryer!

1338
02:03:54,208 --> 02:03:56,542
Can't you see we're overloaded?

1339
02:03:58,815 --> 02:04:00,757
One man more and you'll sink me.

1340
02:04:00,895 --> 02:04:03,262
Well, if that's the case, I'll volunteer!

1341
02:04:04,094 --> 02:04:06,483
You got to let me go, sir.
I ain't a mutineer.

1342
02:04:06,559 --> 02:04:08,533
- Hold those men!
- What's going to happen to us?

1343
02:04:08,606 --> 02:04:09,980
We want to go, too.

1344
02:04:12,253 --> 02:04:15,253
Now, I want it clearly understood
by yourself

1345
02:04:15,645 --> 02:04:17,586
and those of you below,

1346
02:04:17,692 --> 02:04:20,887
that these men who remain behind
had no hand in this mutiny.

1347
02:04:20,956 --> 02:04:22,897
- What happens to us?
- I don't want no part of it.

1348
02:04:22,971 --> 02:04:24,531
You men will be put ashore safely

1349
02:04:24,603 --> 02:04:26,775
at a British port of call
at the first opportunity.

1350
02:04:26,843 --> 02:04:28,217
How do we know when that will be?

1351
02:04:28,283 --> 02:04:30,966
- How about our family?
- Birkett,

1352
02:04:31,130 --> 02:04:33,812
confine these men below
and station an armed man at each hatch.

1353
02:04:33,881 --> 02:04:36,947
- Aye, sir. Come on get moving.
- Move or you'll be shot!

1354
02:04:37,048 --> 02:04:39,023
Come on, quick.
Take them below, Johnson.

1355
02:04:39,096 --> 02:04:41,365
Come on, quick at the back there.

1356
02:04:41,431 --> 02:04:44,627
Has your murderous friend
told you what to expect?

1357
02:04:44,727 --> 02:04:46,615
Or is he going to keep you in the dark?

1358
02:04:46,680 --> 02:04:48,054
Now hear the truth!

1359
02:04:48,951 --> 02:04:51,089
The King's Navy will not rest

1360
02:04:51,158 --> 02:04:54,507
until every mutineer is captured
and executed.

1361
02:04:54,613 --> 02:04:57,547
Wherever you go, wherever you hide,

1362
02:04:57,652 --> 02:05:01,132
- a thousand ships will search you out.
- Well, let them try!

1363
02:05:01,204 --> 02:05:03,472
If it weren't for Mr. Christian,
I'd give them more reason to look for me.

1364
02:05:05,107 --> 02:05:09,068
Will you step into the boat
or will you be thrown in, Mr. Bligh?

1365
02:05:15,410 --> 02:05:18,060
I'm not leaving you, Mr. Christian.

1366
02:05:19,793 --> 02:05:20,937
Not ever.

1367
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:23,527
Go to the dirtiest little corner of the world,

1368
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:27,113
I'll be there, right behind you,
with a rope in my hand.

1369
02:05:28,463 --> 02:05:30,219
One moment. Quintal.

1370
02:05:51,755 --> 02:05:53,729
Take your flag with you.

1371
02:05:59,433 --> 02:06:01,953
I don't need a flag, Mr. Christian.

1372
02:06:04,104 --> 02:06:07,236
Unlike you, I still have a country.

1373
02:06:13,383 --> 02:06:16,994
What a big price to pay
for a little show of temper.

1374
02:06:19,429 --> 02:06:20,858
I pity you.

1375
02:06:32,579 --> 02:06:35,710
We're rid of you now, Bligh!
You bloody maniac!

1376
02:06:35,779 --> 02:06:37,437
You and your tub and your ladles of water.

1377
02:06:37,507 --> 02:06:39,164
Bye, bye, tyranny!

1378
02:06:39,490 --> 02:06:43,798
- Hey, look, you forgot these.
- Hey, fellas, let's sink them with them.

1379
02:06:44,609 --> 02:06:46,813
Hey, Bligh, you forgot this.

1380
02:06:47,010 --> 02:06:50,108
No more Bligh!
All the grog and water we can own!

1381
02:06:50,177 --> 02:06:52,664
Hey, Bligh, you've forgotten something!

1382
02:06:53,695 --> 02:06:55,517
We're rid of you now, Bligh,
you bloody maniac.

1383
02:06:55,583 --> 02:06:58,103
You and your tub and ladles of water!

1384
02:06:58,175 --> 02:06:59,865
Bye bye, tyranny!

1385
02:08:22,095 --> 02:08:23,371
Come in.

1386
02:08:35,789 --> 02:08:37,828
Are you ready for us, sir?

1387
02:08:41,963 --> 02:08:44,330
You men are now ship's officers.

1388
02:08:45,675 --> 02:08:48,392
Mills, you're First Officer. Birkett, you're...

1389
02:08:48,491 --> 02:08:50,149
You're Second.

1390
02:08:52,106 --> 02:08:55,072
And, Smith, you'll fill the Master's duties.

1391
02:08:57,768 --> 02:08:59,491
It's gonna be a bit awkward, sir,

1392
02:08:59,560 --> 02:09:02,178
telling our mates to jump to it
when we have to.

1393
02:09:02,727 --> 02:09:04,320
Yeah, that's right.

1394
02:09:04,391 --> 02:09:07,042
They'll think we're proper poopers.

1395
02:09:07,943 --> 02:09:10,245
Let them think what they like.

1396
02:09:10,311 --> 02:09:12,133
A ship crashed on the reef
has a better chance

1397
02:09:12,198 --> 02:09:13,888
than one without discipline.

1398
02:09:13,958 --> 02:09:16,292
No doubt about that.
But making our mates swallow it,

1399
02:09:16,357 --> 02:09:18,113
that's the part that pinches.

1400
02:09:18,181 --> 02:09:20,798
I'll make the beggars heed me
if I have to break their necks.

1401
02:09:20,868 --> 02:09:23,650
Here, listen to him,
acting like an officer already.

1402
02:09:23,875 --> 02:09:26,297
Hold that noise for the fo'c'sle.

1403
02:09:28,899 --> 02:09:32,477
Your pardon, gentlemen.
I'm forgetting your new status.

1404
02:09:33,474 --> 02:09:36,321
Oh, that's all right, sir. We understand.

1405
02:09:37,761 --> 02:09:40,346
Well, at least
the common seamen are happy.

1406
02:09:40,417 --> 02:09:43,166
- They have a right. We won, didn't we?
- Aye! That we did.

1407
02:09:43,232 --> 02:09:44,409
Won?

1408
02:09:46,912 --> 02:09:48,951
Won what, you damn fool?

1409
02:09:51,999 --> 02:09:55,381
We got rid of Bligh.
I'd be a dead man if we didn't.

1410
02:09:56,894 --> 02:09:59,861
Or in prison for the rest of my life,
if I was lucky.

1411
02:09:59,933 --> 02:10:03,162
You're in prison now, Mills.
With one slight difference.

1412
02:10:03,228 --> 02:10:05,650
We're not locked in. We're locked out.

1413
02:10:13,502 --> 02:10:16,021
Briefly, and for the moment,
our plans will be as follows,

1414
02:10:16,093 --> 02:10:18,646
we'll return to Tahiti
and deposit our prisoners,

1415
02:10:18,717 --> 02:10:20,789
we'll pick up all the water
and stores we can carry,

1416
02:10:20,861 --> 02:10:23,348
and all the extra hands we can find.

1417
02:10:23,420 --> 02:10:25,940
And as to where we shall go after that,

1418
02:10:27,228 --> 02:10:30,097
we shall not decide
until we're at sea again.

1419
02:10:31,291 --> 02:10:32,948
Is that all, sir?

1420
02:10:35,610 --> 02:10:37,203
Yes, that's all.

1421
02:10:45,304 --> 02:10:47,541
Excuse me, Mr. Christian, sir.

1422
02:10:48,664 --> 02:10:52,819
It isn't my place to say this,
but I know how you must be feeling.

1423
02:10:52,887 --> 02:10:56,367
Might I say though, sir,
that, considering my years and such...

1424
02:10:57,430 --> 02:10:59,023
What is it, Smith?

1425
02:10:59,094 --> 02:11:02,475
Things are going to be all right for you, sir.
They've got be.

1426
02:11:02,581 --> 02:11:06,378
When a man gives up as much as you did,
just because he thinks it's right,

1427
02:11:06,453 --> 02:11:09,005
the Good Lord would never let him down.

1428
02:11:09,108 --> 02:11:12,850
Wherever we might go,
be it to China or Iceland or anywhere,

1429
02:11:13,427 --> 02:11:15,499
you'll find a happy life, sir.

1430
02:11:15,571 --> 02:11:18,123
It's God's will. I know.

1431
02:11:19,825 --> 02:11:23,534
I believe I did what honor dictated.
And that belief sustains me.

1432
02:11:23,601 --> 02:11:26,950
Except for a slight desire to be dead,
which I'm sure will pass.

1433
02:11:27,057 --> 02:11:29,260
Oh, yes. God bless you, sir.

1434
02:12:01,994 --> 02:12:05,441
We have 60 pieces of pork, sir.
150 pieces of bread.

1435
02:12:05,514 --> 02:12:08,448
Thirty-eight gallons of water,
a gallon of rum.

1436
02:12:08,521 --> 02:12:10,854
There's also a compass aboard. A sextant.

1437
02:12:10,921 --> 02:12:14,116
- We have seven sea bags...
- Tafoa be damned.

1438
02:12:15,016 --> 02:12:16,161
Oars!

1439
02:12:21,478 --> 02:12:23,420
Get ready to make sail!

1440
02:12:26,278 --> 02:12:27,838
Your attention.

1441
02:12:30,277 --> 02:12:32,448
We shall not make for Tafoa.

1442
02:12:33,188 --> 02:12:34,562
We shall make for a port

1443
02:12:34,628 --> 02:12:37,824
where we can get passage
to England immediately.

1444
02:12:38,307 --> 02:12:40,162
We'll head for Timor.

1445
02:12:42,914 --> 02:12:44,027
Timor!

1446
02:12:44,130 --> 02:12:47,676
- That's nearly 4,000 miles away, sir.
- I'm well aware of that, Mr. Fryer.

1447
02:12:47,746 --> 02:12:51,901
Timor is 3,600 miles away.
It's an arduous journey,

1448
02:12:52,449 --> 02:12:54,837
but the trade winds
will be in our favor all the way.

1449
02:12:54,912 --> 02:12:57,661
Do not be alarmed,
I will get you there safely.

1450
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:00,214
Yeah, like you got us
around the Horn safely.

1451
02:13:03,550 --> 02:13:07,511
It would be a mistake to imagine
that I am no longer in command.

1452
02:13:07,902 --> 02:13:10,455
I have at hand
one means of asserting my authority.

1453
02:13:10,526 --> 02:13:14,551
- There will be no minor punishments.
- Excuse me, sir, might I ask,

1454
02:13:14,621 --> 02:13:17,303
what is wrong with Tafoa,
as Mr. Christian suggested?

1455
02:13:17,372 --> 02:13:19,160
- Aye, Tafoa.
- Aye!

1456
02:13:19,228 --> 02:13:24,016
It would suit his book if it took us
a couple of years to get back to England.

1457
02:13:24,154 --> 02:13:26,489
The colder the trail, the safer he'll be.

1458
02:13:27,323 --> 02:13:28,752
It would suit him even better

1459
02:13:28,827 --> 02:13:31,673
if the natives of Tafoa
turned out to be cannibals.

1460
02:13:31,962 --> 02:13:33,750
- Cannibals.
- Cannibal? Where?

1461
02:13:33,849 --> 02:13:35,223
In Tafoa?

1462
02:13:35,321 --> 02:13:38,636
This whole island group
is infested with cannibals.

1463
02:13:38,808 --> 02:13:40,662
Continue to make sail.

1464
02:13:43,223 --> 02:13:46,639
That should help improve
the morale a bit, Mr. Fryer.

1465
02:13:49,239 --> 02:13:53,394
Don't look so concerned.
You're quite right. The odds are appalling.

1466
02:13:57,621 --> 02:14:02,191
You see, these mutineers must hang.
They must hang.

1467
02:14:36,462 --> 02:14:38,468
Fletcher, may I come in?

1468
02:14:38,541 --> 02:14:40,264
Not just now, Ned.

1469
02:14:41,196 --> 02:14:42,984
We've dropped anchor.

1470
02:14:45,517 --> 02:14:49,923
Well, then, go and make arrangements
with Minarii to land our prisoners.

1471
02:14:50,828 --> 02:14:53,893
It's a beautiful day.
Aren't you coming ashore?

1472
02:14:57,865 --> 02:15:01,247
Fletcher, you can't keep sitting
in your cabin like this.

1473
02:15:01,353 --> 02:15:02,563
It's unhealthy.

1474
02:15:02,633 --> 02:15:06,407
Oh, for God's sakes, Ned,
can't you simply do as you're told?

1475
02:15:14,790 --> 02:15:17,659
Oh, the way they laugh,
like they never heard of trouble.

1476
02:15:17,734 --> 02:15:19,228
They sound like wine tastes.

1477
02:15:19,302 --> 02:15:22,683
A man could get happy drunk
just listening to them.

1478
02:15:25,925 --> 02:15:28,478
Hutia! Hutia! Where are you, girl?

1479
02:15:28,580 --> 02:15:31,896
Come here, my little kissing bug.
I got joyful news for you.

1480
02:15:31,971 --> 02:15:35,069
You're coming with us.
You're going to make an ocean voyage.

1481
02:15:35,138 --> 02:15:38,138
Mr. Christian says
we can take women with us if we want.

1482
02:15:38,210 --> 02:15:40,414
Do you hear that, Quintal?
You can take a woman with you,

1483
02:15:40,482 --> 02:15:42,653
if you can find one
with that horrible face of yours.

1484
02:15:42,721 --> 02:15:43,833
Look who's talking?

1485
02:15:43,905 --> 02:15:45,945
You're ugly enough
to turn a funeral up an alley.

1486
02:15:46,017 --> 02:15:48,155
And we're taking men with us, too.

1487
02:15:48,289 --> 02:15:51,419
Minarii and five hands
to do our work for us.

1488
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:53,498
Now, what a navy!

1489
02:15:53,568 --> 02:15:56,382
It's too good for the likes of you, mates,
carting women along.

1490
02:15:56,447 --> 02:15:59,349
It has me worried.
What the hell does it all mean?

1491
02:15:59,454 --> 02:16:02,137
Will you stop that "what's this all mean"?

1492
02:16:02,206 --> 02:16:04,344
I wonder why we don't just stay here
in Tahiti.

1493
02:16:04,413 --> 02:16:07,577
You're mad. Tahiti's the first place
Bligh will come to look for us.

1494
02:16:07,645 --> 02:16:08,855
If he lives.

1495
02:16:08,925 --> 02:16:10,834
You ever tried to drown a snake?

1496
02:16:10,941 --> 02:16:13,690
And a sea-going snake,
at that, with a damn fine sextant.

1497
02:16:13,756 --> 02:16:15,032
Aye. And with a sextant,

1498
02:16:15,099 --> 02:16:17,684
a good sailorman, like Bligh,
could make port in a hollow tooth.

1499
02:16:17,755 --> 02:16:20,471
All right. Let's say he lived to see London,
then say he comes back here.

1500
02:16:20,538 --> 02:16:22,480
How is he going to find us
if we're hid deep in the hills?

1501
02:16:22,554 --> 02:16:24,080
Easy, he'd ask Hitihiti.

1502
02:16:24,153 --> 02:16:27,830
Aye! That old rascal could be bought
for a bucket of glass beads.

1503
02:16:27,929 --> 02:16:30,416
Mr. Christian is bound to find us
someplace safe to go.

1504
02:16:30,489 --> 02:16:33,488
- You can trust him, mates.
- Yeah. Sitting all alone in his cabin.

1505
02:16:33,560 --> 02:16:34,989
He's changed a lot.

1506
02:16:35,095 --> 02:16:37,135
So would you be changed
if you lost what he lost.

1507
02:16:37,208 --> 02:16:39,727
Anyway, there's been nothing wrong
with his plans so far, has there?

1508
02:16:39,798 --> 02:16:40,911
Not a thing.

1509
02:16:41,014 --> 02:16:44,461
Except keeping us from giving Bligh
a taste of his own lash.

1510
02:18:29,411 --> 02:18:31,069
Hello, Maimiti.

1511
02:18:32,194 --> 02:18:33,688
Fletcher sick?

1512
02:18:36,033 --> 02:18:38,007
No, I'm very well, thank you.

1513
02:18:38,209 --> 02:18:42,747
Minarii tell, Fletcher fight war.
Fletcher chief now.

1514
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:47,483
Very small chief, Maimiti,
running for his life.

1515
02:18:48,735 --> 02:18:52,597
Minarii tell you take Tahiti people
away in ship.

1516
02:18:53,534 --> 02:18:55,705
Yes, we'll need men to sail it.

1517
02:19:00,861 --> 02:19:02,649
You take women, too.

1518
02:19:04,827 --> 02:19:08,919
The men will want to be amused
while they look for a place to hide.

1519
02:19:15,642 --> 02:19:17,464
Maimiti go along you.

1520
02:19:22,809 --> 02:19:24,270
You not want?

1521
02:19:28,536 --> 02:19:30,902
I'm afraid there's no want left in me.

1522
02:19:30,968 --> 02:19:32,593
Now, if you don't mind,

1523
02:19:32,695 --> 02:19:36,339
I have some work to do
and I prefer to be alone to do it.

1524
02:19:37,462 --> 02:19:39,632
Maimiti go. You no Ionely.

1525
02:19:43,636 --> 02:19:46,735
I don't need you
to remind me of my Ioneliness.

1526
02:19:48,245 --> 02:19:51,277
- Maimiti go.
- Are you deaf as well as ignorant?

1527
02:19:52,052 --> 02:19:56,045
Can't I make it clear to you
that I have no life to share with anyone!

1528
02:19:56,115 --> 02:19:58,024
No yelling Maimiti you!

1529
02:20:11,568 --> 02:20:13,804
You pig. Pig all over.

1530
02:20:22,797 --> 02:20:25,100
Do you really want
to spend your life with a man

1531
02:20:25,166 --> 02:20:28,100
that doesn't care for anything
on this earth?

1532
02:20:30,029 --> 02:20:34,785
Tahiti people say,
"You hate life, all life hate you."

1533
02:20:35,115 --> 02:20:36,522
Maimiti go.

1534
02:21:19,875 --> 02:21:21,533
Lieutenant William Bligh,

1535
02:21:21,634 --> 02:21:24,383
the court has considered
the charges against you.

1536
02:21:24,482 --> 02:21:27,003
And their finding is that
no blame attaches to you,

1537
02:21:27,075 --> 02:21:29,595
<i>for the loss of His Majesty's ship, Bounty.</i>

1538
02:21:29,666 --> 02:21:32,665
You are, therefore,
most honorably acquitted.

1539
02:21:32,897 --> 02:21:35,318
The court finds that mutiny
and piracy have been committed

1540
02:21:35,393 --> 02:21:36,734
against His Majesty's Navy.

1541
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:39,767
The court makes recommendation
to the First Lord of the Admiralty

1542
02:21:39,840 --> 02:21:43,188
which recommendation shall be entered
in the record of these proceedings to wit,

1543
02:21:43,262 --> 02:21:47,572
an expedition of pursuit
be commissioned posthaste

1544
02:21:47,679 --> 02:21:50,712
and charged to capture,
and bring to justice the parties

1545
02:21:50,782 --> 02:21:53,912
<i>responsible for the loss
of His Majesty's ship, Bounty.</i>

1546
02:21:53,981 --> 02:21:56,402
They can hardly evade us for long.

1547
02:21:56,989 --> 02:21:59,377
I shall pray they do not, Milord.

1548
02:22:00,027 --> 02:22:04,566
The court considers it has obligation
to add comment to its verdict.

1549
02:22:06,715 --> 02:22:09,976
By the force of evidentiary conclusions,

1550
02:22:10,074 --> 02:22:13,968
you, Captain William Bligh,
stand absolved of military misdeed.

1551
02:22:14,458 --> 02:22:18,232
Yet officers of stainless record
and seamen, voluntary all,

1552
02:22:18,297 --> 02:22:20,718
were moved to mutiny against you.

1553
02:22:21,176 --> 02:22:23,347
Your methods,
so far as this court can discern,

1554
02:22:23,415 --> 02:22:27,244
showed what we shall cautiously term
an excess of zeal.

1555
02:22:28,215 --> 02:22:30,124
We cannot condemn zeal.

1556
02:22:30,230 --> 02:22:33,263
We cannot rebuke an officer
who has administered discipline

1557
02:22:33,334 --> 02:22:35,057
according to the Articles of War.

1558
02:22:35,126 --> 02:22:38,867
But the Articles are fallible
as any Articles are bound to be.

1559
02:22:38,932 --> 02:22:41,452
No code can cover all contingencies.

1560
02:22:42,484 --> 02:22:45,833
We cannot put justice
aboard our ships in books.

1561
02:22:45,941 --> 02:22:47,762
Justice and decency

1562
02:22:48,404 --> 02:22:52,232
are carried in the heart of the captain
or they be not aboard.

1563
02:22:53,522 --> 02:22:56,271
It is for this reason
that the Admiralty has always sought

1564
02:22:56,338 --> 02:22:59,021
to appoint its officers
from the ranks of gentlemen.

1565
02:22:59,089 --> 02:23:01,357
The court regrets to note that

1566
02:23:01,456 --> 02:23:05,417
the appointment of Captain William Bligh
was, in that respect, a failure.

1567
02:23:07,088 --> 02:23:09,030
The Court is dissolved.

1568
02:23:11,407 --> 02:23:14,919
<i>For several months
we sought a suitable place to dwell.</i>

1569
02:23:15,246 --> 02:23:18,279
<i>The Bounty visited at least 30 islands.</i>

1570
02:23:18,926 --> 02:23:21,292
<i>None of them served our purpose.</i>

1571
02:23:21,581 --> 02:23:26,087
<i>In some cases, the natives repulsed us
with barrages of stones and arrows.</i>

1572
02:23:26,445 --> 02:23:29,575
<i>In others, we found the vegetation
too sparse to sustain life</i>

1573
02:23:29,643 --> 02:23:31,977
<i>or the water supply too limited.</i>

1574
02:23:32,683 --> 02:23:35,432
<i>But our disappointments
did not depress us.</i>

1575
02:23:35,531 --> 02:23:38,432
<i>Mr. Christian knew
how to keep a happy ship.</i>

1576
02:23:38,537 --> 02:23:41,352
<i>As for himself,
he gave no sign of discontent.</i>

1577
02:23:41,449 --> 02:23:44,646
<i>True, he had a habit
of falling into Brown's studies</i>

1578
02:23:44,713 --> 02:23:46,207
<i>of wrestling with some problem</i>

1579
02:23:46,281 --> 02:23:48,669
<i>that took him far away
from where he stood.</i>

1580
02:23:48,777 --> 02:23:53,118
<i>Still, his failure to solve his private riddle
was never taken out on us.</i>

1581
02:23:53,511 --> 02:23:55,038
<i>He was no Bligh.</i>

1582
02:23:55,111 --> 02:23:57,979
<i>And the absence of Bligh was a daily tonic.</i>

1583
02:23:58,086 --> 02:24:00,190
Please, Officers first.

1584
02:24:01,317 --> 02:24:04,798
No matter what sort of noise they make,
they always sound lovable.

1585
02:24:21,922 --> 02:24:24,606
They've sighted us. She's turning round.

1586
02:24:24,674 --> 02:24:26,561
Merchantman or man-of-war?

1587
02:24:28,034 --> 02:24:30,237
It's the whereabouts of the sun
concerns me now.

1588
02:24:30,305 --> 02:24:32,606
It'll set in about 40 minutes.

1589
02:24:38,463 --> 02:24:40,502
What is it, Mr. Christian?

1590
02:24:41,758 --> 02:24:44,213
It's an English warship, Mr. Mills.

1591
02:24:46,398 --> 02:24:50,903
Let her mark our course well.
We'll alter it after dark.

1592
02:24:51,645 --> 02:24:55,255
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Douse all lights. Cold supper, no pipes.

1593
02:24:56,635 --> 02:24:58,096
- Mr. Birkett?
- Sir.

1594
02:24:58,203 --> 02:25:00,025
- Arm all hands.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1595
02:25:18,615 --> 02:25:20,469
What's the hour?

1596
02:25:21,879 --> 02:25:23,472
About two bells.

1597
02:25:23,734 --> 02:25:27,509
- I never spent a longer night.
- Me neither.

1598
02:25:29,494 --> 02:25:32,177
- I'm glad it's getting light.
- I ain't.

1599
02:25:32,629 --> 02:25:34,800
What if she's still there?

1600
02:25:34,869 --> 02:25:37,902
We outrun her, or we outshoot her,
or we swing.

1601
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:02,988
Not a sail in sight. Ned, I'll have that glass.

1602
02:26:08,079 --> 02:26:10,249
No sight at all of her, sir?

1603
02:26:11,662 --> 02:26:14,508
What is it you were looking at then, sir?

1604
02:26:15,597 --> 02:26:18,346
It's land. It's there,

1605
02:26:19,660 --> 02:26:21,067
but it shouldn't be.

1606
02:26:21,132 --> 02:26:23,270
Mills, Brown, come with me.

1607
02:26:33,354 --> 02:26:37,030
Yes. This is our position,
give or take 10 miles.

1608
02:26:37,833 --> 02:26:39,261
Empty water.

1609
02:26:39,752 --> 02:26:42,021
What's this piece of land over here, sir?

1610
02:26:42,088 --> 02:26:46,244
That is Pitcairn Island.
It's over a 170 miles due east.

1611
02:26:49,447 --> 02:26:50,788
Or is it?

1612
02:26:51,431 --> 02:26:55,172
Well, it must be, sir.
There isn't land anywhere else about.

1613
02:26:55,430 --> 02:26:57,120
Yes, that's right.

1614
02:26:59,844 --> 02:27:02,713
This must be Pitcairn. It's charted wrong.

1615
02:27:05,924 --> 02:27:07,266
And then, it's charted wrong

1616
02:27:07,332 --> 02:27:10,201
on every single official chart
in the British Navy.

1617
02:27:11,907 --> 02:27:16,216
Don't you see? Pitcairn is a 175 miles
away from where it actually lies.

1618
02:27:16,290 --> 02:27:19,966
It can only be found by accident,
just as we have done.

1619
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:28,254
At first, we must find out
whether or not it's inhabited,

1620
02:27:28,320 --> 02:27:29,847
and if their people are friendly.

1621
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:34,196
Mills, I want you to take an armed party.
Go ashore. We'll cover you.

1622
02:27:41,693 --> 02:27:44,541
Minarii, have your men stand by to cover.

1623
02:28:22,005 --> 02:28:23,663
It looks deserted.

1624
02:28:25,078 --> 02:28:28,208
- No people here.
- Tell Mr. Christian.

1625
02:28:31,092 --> 02:28:34,986
Well, laddies, how does it feel
to be land-owning squires, eh?

1626
02:28:35,252 --> 02:28:37,291
Without tenants
making hungry mouths at us.

1627
02:28:37,363 --> 02:28:38,988
No poachers either, eh?

1628
02:28:39,091 --> 02:28:41,676
Come on, let's take a little twirl
round our estate, then.

1629
02:28:41,746 --> 02:28:44,779
That's a good idea.
Come on, Mr. Kew Gardens.

1630
02:29:02,318 --> 02:29:03,725
Breadfruit.

1631
02:29:10,349 --> 02:29:14,276
Mr. Young, look, yams, papaya, taro root.

1632
02:29:14,348 --> 02:29:17,195
Why, the island's a garden.
Beautiful rich soil.

1633
02:29:17,259 --> 02:29:19,364
- What's that?
- Oh, it's some sort of a tuber.

1634
02:29:19,435 --> 02:29:21,442
I can't tell till I cultivate it.

1635
02:29:23,018 --> 02:29:25,669
Do you think Mr. Christian
would like the garden right here?

1636
02:29:25,738 --> 02:29:29,054
Well, not if we decide
to live on the other side of the island.

1637
02:29:31,497 --> 02:29:34,431
- I got it.
- Good shot. Here!

1638
02:29:34,601 --> 02:29:38,178
Birkett, Mr. Young,
there's tons of food here.

1639
02:29:38,311 --> 02:29:42,172
Here! I've just seen enough game
to feed the whole of the British Navy.

1640
02:29:42,279 --> 02:29:44,319
- I'm not kidding you.
- Water aplenty.

1641
02:29:44,391 --> 02:29:47,554
And fish. Big ones. Real big ones.

1642
02:29:49,094 --> 02:29:50,784
Hey, mates, look here!

1643
02:29:51,622 --> 02:29:54,850
- Pigeon pie for dinner!
- Pigeon? With red feathers?

1644
02:29:54,949 --> 02:29:56,770
All right, all right, whatever it is then.

1645
02:29:56,837 --> 02:29:58,113
- They're pretty, ain't they?
- Yeah.

1646
02:29:58,180 --> 02:30:00,187
The tail feathers are for Hutia.

1647
02:30:24,416 --> 02:30:27,317
- This is better than Tahiti, even.
- It's the climate. It's cooler.

1648
02:30:27,391 --> 02:30:31,187
Well, it's not the climate we're tasting.
It's that lovely mapmaker's mistake.

1649
02:30:31,262 --> 02:30:33,717
Mates, there's only one thing missing.
Captain Bligh.

1650
02:30:33,789 --> 02:30:35,251
Oh, yes.

1651
02:30:35,325 --> 02:30:37,016
I'd give a leg or two
if he could see us now.

1652
02:30:37,085 --> 02:30:39,506
Eating away to our heart's content
without a care in the world.

1653
02:30:39,581 --> 02:30:42,776
Yeah, I like him better where he is.
I like him going away in his little boat,

1654
02:30:42,843 --> 02:30:45,113
with the hot sun beating down
on his hot little head.

1655
02:30:45,180 --> 02:30:47,481
Well, God grant him a dry mouth.

1656
02:30:48,060 --> 02:30:51,572
Do you remember when he bid us
goodbye, all blown up like a toad?

1657
02:30:51,643 --> 02:30:54,293
"I'll never leave you, Mr. Christian.
Not ever.

1658
02:30:54,362 --> 02:30:57,012
"No matter where you go,
I'll always be at your shoulder,

1659
02:30:57,081 --> 02:30:59,317
"with a rope in me hand."

1660
02:30:59,417 --> 02:31:01,904
Of course,
he's a man of his word, is Captain Bligh.

1661
02:31:01,976 --> 02:31:04,245
So perhaps we ought to set him a plate.

1662
02:31:05,720 --> 02:31:08,719
Why, hello there. Captain Bligh, sir.

1663
02:31:09,080 --> 02:31:12,691
Sit down, sir. Sit down.
Here have a bird wing or two.

1664
02:31:12,919 --> 02:31:15,602
And kindly explain why you ain't here.

1665
02:31:18,326 --> 02:31:19,569
There's no doubt about it.

1666
02:31:19,637 --> 02:31:23,379
Nobody's glad to see a captain
who comes home without his ship.

1667
02:31:24,053 --> 02:31:26,834
You know, I'd give a stick of tabaccy
to see his ruddy report.

1668
02:31:26,900 --> 02:31:30,860
Those Admiralty Lords will look at him
like he was a piece of rotten biscuit.

1669
02:31:30,931 --> 02:31:34,192
I'm afraid your laughter
is unwarranted, gentlemen.

1670
02:31:39,057 --> 02:31:41,358
Captain Bligh will be acquitted.

1671
02:31:41,457 --> 02:31:43,279
He'll be given another ship.

1672
02:31:43,377 --> 02:31:45,482
A larger cat-o'-nine-tails to run it with.

1673
02:31:45,553 --> 02:31:48,106
You're forgetting there's mates of ours
went along with Bligh, sir.

1674
02:31:48,176 --> 02:31:49,550
They'll tell what the old pig did.

1675
02:31:49,616 --> 02:31:52,168
And they'll tell how he was out
to execute all of us, one by one.

1676
02:31:52,239 --> 02:31:53,384
Sure.

1677
02:31:55,374 --> 02:31:59,629
Your friends are under the shadow
of arraignment themselves for mutiny,

1678
02:31:59,725 --> 02:32:02,921
if Bligh chooses to charge
that they failed to rally to his calls,

1679
02:32:02,989 --> 02:32:05,062
or to protect him properly.

1680
02:32:05,453 --> 02:32:08,682
- Why should they invite his anger?
- They won't be given any choice, sir.

1681
02:32:08,749 --> 02:32:11,399
They'll be asked questions, and the facts
will speak for themselves, right?

1682
02:32:11,468 --> 02:32:15,079
The bare facts alone will not indict Bligh.

1683
02:32:15,147 --> 02:32:17,056
It's the privilege of every captain to decide

1684
02:32:17,131 --> 02:32:20,327
when an emergency warrants
the reduction of water rations.

1685
02:32:20,394 --> 02:32:22,913
Who can deny there was an emergency?

1686
02:32:23,561 --> 02:32:25,471
<i>The Bounty carried breadfruit.</i>

1687
02:32:25,545 --> 02:32:28,741
Vital to the economic life
of the British Empire.

1688
02:32:29,320 --> 02:32:30,880
Do you suppose it'll be acceptable

1689
02:32:30,952 --> 02:32:34,148
that Bligh should return
after a two-year voyage

1690
02:32:35,239 --> 02:32:37,475
with his ship laden with dead plants?

1691
02:32:37,543 --> 02:32:39,452
Better than with dead men, sir.

1692
02:32:39,559 --> 02:32:41,925
You're forgetting
the traditional answer, Mills.

1693
02:32:41,990 --> 02:32:45,339
Mission comes first
and lives of men second.

1694
02:32:46,566 --> 02:32:47,972
Well, it's all the one to us now.

1695
02:32:48,037 --> 02:32:50,241
Let them make Captain Bligh
King of China if they want to.

1696
02:32:50,309 --> 02:32:51,519
We can forget him, thank God.

1697
02:32:51,589 --> 02:32:53,890
And I move we start forgetting him
right now.

1698
02:32:53,956 --> 02:32:55,614
Bligh guilty, or Bligh not guilty,

1699
02:32:55,683 --> 02:32:58,203
it makes no difference
to our lovely little island.

1700
02:32:58,275 --> 02:33:02,332
And if it did, we could write out papers
telling our side of the story,

1701
02:33:02,434 --> 02:33:04,671
seal them in bottles
and send them floating on the sea.

1702
02:33:04,738 --> 02:33:06,876
Hey, that's a thought.
One of them might even bob along

1703
02:33:06,946 --> 02:33:10,458
and reach England ahead of Bligh.
That'd put a spike in his coffin.

1704
02:33:12,160 --> 02:33:15,127
We can make certain
that his coffin is spiked.

1705
02:33:15,360 --> 02:33:17,214
What do you mean, sir?

1706
02:33:19,199 --> 02:33:21,620
By returning to England ourselves.

1707
02:33:25,854 --> 02:33:29,083
- Well, what the holy hell for?
- You're not serious, Mr. Christian.

1708
02:33:29,150 --> 02:33:31,516
It's a joke he'll be after having, that's all.

1709
02:33:31,581 --> 02:33:34,712
- Well, it was a joke to spoil me dinner.
- Hold it, hold it.

1710
02:33:35,741 --> 02:33:38,936
Mr. Christian is meaning what he says,
I'm afraid.

1711
02:33:40,251 --> 02:33:43,599
- Yes, I am, Mills.
- Then I've got a better idea, sir.

1712
02:33:44,187 --> 02:33:46,804
Why don't we hang each other
from the yardarms in the morning?

1713
02:33:46,874 --> 02:33:49,013
- It'll save us a trip!
- Yes.

1714
02:33:49,945 --> 02:33:52,847
Listen to me for one moment,
gentlemen, please.

1715
02:33:52,953 --> 02:33:54,327
I put it to you

1716
02:33:54,425 --> 02:33:58,221
that we shall never find contentment
on this island.

1717
02:33:58,423 --> 02:34:00,976
Sir, it sounds
like you've gone out of your mind.

1718
02:34:01,048 --> 02:34:03,284
There's no chance for people like us
to go back to England,

1719
02:34:03,351 --> 02:34:05,740
give Bligh a bad name
and walk free men ourselves.

1720
02:34:05,815 --> 02:34:09,611
And anyone who thinks otherwise
hasn't got the sense that God gave geese!

1721
02:34:11,894 --> 02:34:13,649
You're right, Mills.

1722
02:34:14,773 --> 02:34:17,107
We may all very well be hanged.

1723
02:34:18,932 --> 02:34:22,761
But decency is worth fighting for.
You can't live without it.

1724
02:34:23,251 --> 02:34:26,066
And hiding here, shivering like convicts,

1725
02:34:26,708 --> 02:34:28,911
when we've a just case
to present to the courts,

1726
02:34:28,979 --> 02:34:31,248
is just another way of dying.

1727
02:34:32,850 --> 02:34:35,021
And a far less bearable one.

1728
02:34:36,209 --> 02:34:38,860
I didn't know until this moment,

1729
02:34:40,655 --> 02:34:42,794
what the rightful course to pursue was.

1730
02:34:42,864 --> 02:34:44,555
But I know it now.

1731
02:34:48,847 --> 02:34:50,537
Will you trust me?

1732
02:34:50,766 --> 02:34:53,221
Look, supposing Bligh's
been picked up already.

1733
02:34:53,294 --> 02:34:56,588
Supposing he's been tried and acquitted
by the time we get there.

1734
02:34:56,653 --> 02:34:58,213
Let it be so.

1735
02:34:58,285 --> 02:35:01,765
Our court martial
will be Bligh's court martial over again.

1736
02:35:01,836 --> 02:35:04,138
Our jeopardy
will be Bligh's' jeopardy as well.

1737
02:35:04,204 --> 02:35:06,756
And our acquittal will be Bligh's defeat.

1738
02:35:06,860 --> 02:35:11,529
It'll mean no more Captain William Bligh
or any like him in His Majesty's service.

1739
02:35:11,882 --> 02:35:15,362
We need only persuade the British people
of something they already know,

1740
02:35:15,434 --> 02:35:18,150
that inhumanity is its poorest servant.

1741
02:35:22,920 --> 02:35:24,776
Gentlemen, I beg you.

1742
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:28,509
Help me to carry that word
back to England.

1743
02:35:38,053 --> 02:35:40,835
That's a big thought for people like us.

1744
02:35:41,124 --> 02:35:44,386
Do you mind
if we take the night to talk about it?

1745
02:35:44,645 --> 02:35:45,954
Certainly.

1746
02:36:17,118 --> 02:36:19,736
Mills, Quintal, Birkett, Minarii, quickly!

1747
02:36:19,838 --> 02:36:22,684
Our ship's afire.
Hurry, for God's sake, everyone!

1748
02:36:22,750 --> 02:36:24,823
She's afire! Come quickly!

1749
02:36:27,101 --> 02:36:29,402
Mills, Quintal, Birkett!

1750
02:36:47,034 --> 02:36:48,310
Come on!

1751
02:36:50,425 --> 02:36:52,497
Get the boat in the water.

1752
02:36:59,798 --> 02:37:02,961
Madatafao, as soon as we get aboard
you and Tamas slip the anchor.

1753
02:37:03,030 --> 02:37:05,070
Brown, you and Minarii will hoist the sail.

1754
02:37:05,142 --> 02:37:08,272
When she begins to make headway,
we'll sink her on the shallows.

1755
02:37:08,341 --> 02:37:10,512
Ned, you and I will go below
and open the sea cocks.

1756
02:37:10,581 --> 02:37:13,548
She can be refloated
if we can save the hull.

1757
02:39:16,158 --> 02:39:19,190
- We're fast on a rock.
- Right through the hull.

1758
02:39:20,157 --> 02:39:22,709
- Have you got the sextant, Ned?
- What?

1759
02:39:22,812 --> 02:39:25,846
- Have you got the sextant?
- No.

1760
02:39:26,844 --> 02:39:31,185
- You can't go now. It's too late, Fletcher.
- We'll never leave here without it.

1761
02:39:31,291 --> 02:39:34,323
- Fletcher, you can't go down!
- Abandon ship!

1762
02:40:51,916 --> 02:40:54,785
The cutter's heading back.
They've given up.

1763
02:41:02,794 --> 02:41:04,201
Careful now.

1764
02:41:05,834 --> 02:41:07,590
Find something to cover him.

1765
02:41:09,801 --> 02:41:11,710
Minarii, go to my tent.

1766
02:41:11,785 --> 02:41:14,882
You'll find a chest.
In it is a medicine case, bring it quickly.

1767
02:41:14,951 --> 02:41:17,318
And bring a lamp or a torch,
we shall need light.

1768
02:41:17,383 --> 02:41:19,292
Oh, my God. My God.

1769
02:41:19,910 --> 02:41:21,765
There's some laudanum
in the medicine case.

1770
02:41:21,830 --> 02:41:24,383
It'll stop his pain within a few minutes.

1771
02:41:24,454 --> 02:41:26,875
He'll need it, if he regains consciousness.

1772
02:41:36,388 --> 02:41:38,908
Here, Ned, spread it gently.

1773
02:41:40,739 --> 02:41:41,851
Easy.

1774
02:42:08,062 --> 02:42:10,680
I gave him all the laudanum there was.

1775
02:42:14,205 --> 02:42:17,335
He'll feel nothing
as soon as he assimilates it.

1776
02:42:23,963 --> 02:42:27,127
We must cut away
what's left of his clothing.

1777
02:42:50,326 --> 02:42:52,017
Oh, look at that.

1778
02:42:52,502 --> 02:42:53,930
Oh, my God.

1779
02:42:55,093 --> 02:42:58,126
- It's us done that to him.
- Get away from here.

1780
02:42:58,420 --> 02:43:00,908
Get away from here or I'll cut your throats,
you murdering scum.

1781
02:43:00,980 --> 02:43:02,605
- Ned! Ned, stop!
- I'll kill you.

1782
02:43:02,676 --> 02:43:04,269
No. On my life I gave him bad for good.

1783
02:43:04,340 --> 02:43:07,089
I never done that to anybody
in my life before.

1784
02:43:26,128 --> 02:43:28,997
- What's happened, Brown?
- We're on the beach, Mr. Christian.

1785
02:43:29,071 --> 02:43:30,598
There was an accident.

1786
02:43:30,671 --> 02:43:33,191
You've been burned and you must lie still.

1787
02:43:33,295 --> 02:43:36,011
- Was I hurt badly?
- Not too bad. You're going to be all right.

1788
02:43:36,078 --> 02:43:39,558
But it's important
that you stay as still as possible.

1789
02:43:40,717 --> 02:43:42,309
<i>The Bounty?</i>

1790
02:43:44,269 --> 02:43:46,986
- It's hopeless.
- It's gone.

1791
02:43:51,307 --> 02:43:55,136
- The sextant, did we... Have we lost it?
- No, I have it here, Mr. Christian.

1792
02:43:55,210 --> 02:43:57,599
You must hide it, Brown. Hide it, quickly.

1793
02:44:03,466 --> 02:44:07,043
So, it was your work, the burning.
Was it? You filth.

1794
02:44:07,593 --> 02:44:10,014
I have no want in me to harm you.

1795
02:44:10,760 --> 02:44:14,752
For the love of God, believe
I regret what has happened to you.

1796
02:44:15,271 --> 02:44:16,732
We all do.

1797
02:44:17,702 --> 02:44:20,353
But each man has to follow his own belief,
no matter what.

1798
02:44:20,422 --> 02:44:23,389
You've said this many times
after the mutiny.

1799
02:44:24,197 --> 02:44:26,914
Well, I did what I thought I had to do.

1800
02:44:27,524 --> 02:44:30,273
<i>I burned the Bounty for the good of all.</i>

1801
02:44:30,564 --> 02:44:34,622
It wasn't in bad faith. It was just bad luck.

1802
02:44:37,538 --> 02:44:40,058
For the good of all, Mills?

1803
02:44:48,161 --> 02:44:49,590
Yes, sir.

1804
02:44:50,720 --> 02:44:53,502
<i>But why did you have to burn the Bounty?</i>

1805
02:44:53,760 --> 02:44:55,930
You had no reason to fear me.

1806
02:44:57,374 --> 02:44:59,676
We were afraid, Mr. Christian.

1807
02:45:00,990 --> 02:45:04,787
We were afraid you were going
to take us to London by force.

1808
02:45:05,822 --> 02:45:07,512
Oh, God.

1809
02:45:09,117 --> 02:45:12,345
We're sick
and sorry for what's happened to you.

1810
02:45:12,413 --> 02:45:15,095
We'll never forget what you've done for us.

1811
02:45:15,452 --> 02:45:18,419
It's all right, Mills. It wasn't your fault.

1812
02:45:20,410 --> 02:45:22,898
Bligh left his mark on all of us.

1813
02:45:28,153 --> 02:45:30,095
Goodbye, Mr. Christian.

1814
02:45:32,024 --> 02:45:33,431
May God have mercy on you.

1815
02:45:50,165 --> 02:45:51,855
Am I dying, Brown?

1816
02:45:54,133 --> 02:45:55,856
Yes, Mr. Christian.

1817
02:46:05,587 --> 02:46:07,659
What a useless way to die.

1818
02:46:08,850 --> 02:46:12,460
It's not useless, Fletcher. I swear it.

1819
02:46:13,297 --> 02:46:16,078
Maybe we'll get to London or maybe not.

1820
02:46:16,176 --> 02:46:18,248
The Blighs will lose.

1821
02:46:19,407 --> 02:46:22,440
We'll tell our story somehow, to someone.

1822
02:46:23,216 --> 02:46:25,735
It only needs one of us to survive.

1823
02:46:53,769 --> 02:46:55,809
Never mind, Maimiti.

1824
02:46:57,193 --> 02:46:59,048
We haven't much time.

1825
02:47:05,768 --> 02:47:07,077
Please...

1826
02:47:08,999 --> 02:47:10,690
Please know that

1827
02:47:14,629 --> 02:47:16,123
I loved you

1828
02:47:18,853 --> 02:47:20,478
