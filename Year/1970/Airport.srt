00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,016
P. A.: Attention.
Attention, please.

00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:23,576
Continental Airlines

00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:17,369
Roger. Cleared to land.
Runway in sight.

8
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,859
Lincoln Tower from Global 45.

9
00:04:20,922 --> 00:04:23,898
We cut the taxiway short.
We're stuck in the snow.

10
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:26,586
Please notify company dispatch.
We'll need assistance.

11
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:34,330
We've got a condition four
on two-niner at taxiway Echo.

12
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:37,562
Change traffic to runway 22.
Two-niner's closed.

13
00:04:37,658 --> 00:04:40,538
Trans World 729, a change.
Taxi to runway 22.

14
00:04:40,602 --> 00:04:42,170
Runway two-niner is closed.

15
00:04:46,746 --> 00:04:49,338
Air Canada ninety-niner,
hold short of taxiway Bravo.

16
00:04:49,403 --> 00:04:51,386
Emergency equipment
will pass to your left.

17
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:06,427
Runway two-niner closed
account of disabled aircraft.

18
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:08,859
22. Approach.
Runway two-niner is closed.

19
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:10,843
We'll stay with 22
with everything.

20
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:15,450
Global 10, clear for takeoff.

21
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:30,939
For this food
and your bounteous goodness,

22
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:34,619
we give thanks to thee
in the name of-Jesus Christ!

23
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:39,259
Mel, I'm glad I caught you
before you got away.

24
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:42,299
Yeah. We just lost
runway two-niner.

25
00:05:42,363 --> 00:05:44,891
Tail's sticking out
on the runway 20 yards.

26
00:05:45,883 --> 00:05:48,220
I don't know.
Could be a long time.

27
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,691
I'll go out there.

28
00:06:20,283 --> 00:06:21,532
Bakersfeld.

29
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:23,740
Mel, Tanya.
How about some coffee?

30
00:06:23,804 --> 00:06:26,299
-I just found something.
-I just lost something.

31
00:06:26,364 --> 00:06:27,740
Runway two-niner.

32
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:29,820
Oh, no. Snow?

33
00:06:29,884 --> 00:06:32,540
One of your jockeys missed
a turnoff, buried the wheel.

34
00:06:32,603 --> 00:06:33,979
No one told us.

35
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:36,380
It just happened.
I'm on my way.

36
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:37,500
Any casualties?

37
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,619
Just me.

38
00:06:38,684 --> 00:06:41,340
There's bound to be
a $50 wrenched back.

39
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:43,419
I'd better bring
some release forms...

40
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:45,339
and plenty of sympathy
and understanding.

41
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:48,092
-May I ride with you?
-See you downstairs.

42
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:02,684
P. A.: Mr. Bakersfeld,
white phone. Urgent.

43
00:07:03,323 --> 00:07:04,540
Bakersfeld.

44
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:06,140
Where the hell are you?

45
00:07:06,204 --> 00:07:08,220
We've got an emergency
on the field.

46
00:07:08,284 --> 00:07:10,619
You said you'd be home at 6:00.

47
00:07:10,684 --> 00:07:14,300
You promised me a week ago
you wouldn't miss this dinner.

48
00:07:14,364 --> 00:07:17,500
I didn't know we'd have
the worst storm in six years.

49
00:07:17,565 --> 00:07:20,060
You've always got
some damn excuse.

50
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:21,372
I'll call you back.

51
00:08:06,045 --> 00:08:09,501
Let me take that, ma'am.
You'll be warmer in the bus.

52
00:08:09,596 --> 00:08:11,068
I'm sorry this happened.

53
00:08:11,132 --> 00:08:14,012
Captain wants
to take off all the weight,

54
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:16,509
hook the nose gear,
and tow it out.

55
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:19,261
The nose gear would never
stand the strain.

56
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:20,861
That's what I said.

57
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:23,420
Maybe use pneumatic bags
and lift the wings.

58
00:08:23,516 --> 00:08:24,701
Could take until tomorrow.

59
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,461
I want it cleared tonight.

60
00:08:26,557 --> 00:08:27,581
Tonight?

61
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:29,501
Look, I know you're trying,

62
00:08:29,597 --> 00:08:33,181
but if I can get Patroni
from TA, will you object?

63
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:35,900
Joe can have
all the tries he wants.

64
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:38,077
Mr. Bakersfeld!
Yes?

65
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:39,549
Snow desk!

66
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:47,261
-Yes, Danny?
-I'm calling Patroni.

67
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:49,693
-Stand by on mobile phone.
-Roger.

68
00:09:01,437 --> 00:09:03,581
-Hello, Joe.
-Hi, Mel.

69
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:06,941
Danny gave me the poop.
Tonight I am not available.

70
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:11,101
Joe, I got 14 on the ground
and 18 stacked upstairs.

71
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:15,101
I've got 5 kids at my mother's
so me and Marie could be alone.

72
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:18,621
Tell Marie I'm sorry,
but I need two-niner badly.

73
00:09:18,717 --> 00:09:20,381
Can't Global handle it?

74
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,622
They're deciding now
what to do,

75
00:09:22,718 --> 00:09:25,981
but I need somebody who knows,
a genius like Patroni.

76
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:28,893
Hold the whipped cream.
I've just had dessert.

77
00:09:30,398 --> 00:09:33,021
-All right, I'll be there.
-Good.

78
00:09:33,117 --> 00:09:35,261
In the meantime,
give everybody a shovel.

79
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:37,822
Start digging an incline
in front of the wheels.

80
00:09:37,918 --> 00:09:39,134
-Right.
-Out.

81
00:09:40,317 --> 00:09:41,981
Aw, Joe.

82
00:09:42,078 --> 00:09:44,542
Do you have to go
to work tonight?

83
00:09:44,638 --> 00:09:46,141
They're not called
emergencies anymore.

84
00:09:46,237 --> 00:09:48,221
They're called Patronis.

85
00:09:48,317 --> 00:09:50,494
I suppose you'll be late, huh?

86
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:53,022
I'll be back in time.

87
00:09:53,118 --> 00:09:55,614
I'll pull that plane out
with my teeth.

88
00:10:01,054 --> 00:10:03,262
What's this you've found?

89
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:06,622
Your brother-in-law was
on the snow clearance committee.

90
00:10:06,718 --> 00:10:08,222
Here's the report.

91
00:10:08,318 --> 00:10:11,741
It says the airport, meaning me,
has been inefficient...

92
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,502
-in snow clearance-
-Grossly inefficient.

93
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:16,062
causing flight delays,
loss of revenue to airlines,

94
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,182
et cetera.

95
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:19,518
Signed Captain Vernon Demerest,
Chairman.

96
00:10:19,582 --> 00:10:20,862
How can he say this?

97
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,942
Because he's a no-good,
irresponsible louse...

98
00:10:23,038 --> 00:10:25,279
who'll take every opportunity
to knife me.

99
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:28,221
Mobile One, snow desk.
Where are you?

100
00:10:28,318 --> 00:10:29,598
At the ramp.

101
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:33,502
Mel, Commissioner Ackerman wants
you at the terminal. Trouble.

102
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:34,878
I'm on my way.

103
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:38,303
Close down runway 22.

104
00:10:38,398 --> 00:10:41,022
Close down runway 22.

105
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:42,462
Keep moving, please.

106
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,502
-Close down runway 22.
-Keep moving, please.

107
00:10:45,598 --> 00:10:48,894
Close down runway 22.

108
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,702
They'll break it up after
the TV cameras get a few shots.

109
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,981
TV?

110
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:56,062
A lawyer arranged
for news coverage.

111
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:57,663
That's all we need.

112
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,382
I'd better get in touch
with the other commissioners.

113
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:03,582
Afterwards you and I will meet
and figure something out...

114
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,655
to calm those people down.
I'll call you.

115
00:11:08,158 --> 00:11:09,375
WOMel!

116
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:13,663
Hi, Sis. I thought Vern
was on flight two.

117
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:14,814
He is.

118
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:18,623
Sure here early enough.

119
00:11:18,718 --> 00:11:22,143
With the weather and traffic,
Vernon didn't want to be late,

120
00:11:22,238 --> 00:11:24,414
but we just sailed right along.

121
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,702
I thought they were pilots
picketing you.

122
00:11:28,798 --> 00:11:30,559
I was set to join them.

123
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,662
I heard about your report.
Besides everything else,

124
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,063
now you're an authority
on snow clearance?

125
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:37,983
I call them
as I see them.

126
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,903
You need an eye check.

127
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:43,102
Clearing those runways and
taxiways is the equivalent...

128
00:11:43,198 --> 00:11:45,503
of 700 miles
of two-lane highway.

129
00:11:45,599 --> 00:11:49,822
And I'll bet you measured every
foot of it all by yourself.

130
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,543
We've had 10 inches
of snow in 24 hours.

131
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,782
Anchorage had twice as much,
and they're clean.

132
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,383
They've got twice
the equipment.

133
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,143
Then get some more.

134
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,703
This isn't Alaska.
You don't spend $2 million...

135
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:03,262
for machinery you'd use
once in 10 years.

136
00:12:03,359 --> 00:12:04,703
You buy for average snowfall.

137
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,263
In an emergency,
you work around the clock.

138
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,624
Sitting behind that desk,
you think like a bookkeeper.

139
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:12,511
I didn't always fly a desk.

140
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:16,543
All right, Daddy, tell me all
about when you were a war hero.

141
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,679
You flew pursuit
and could land in a parking lot.

142
00:12:19,743 --> 00:12:23,423
When I'm setting down
over 200,000 pounds of 707,

143
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,103
I want something under my wheels
that's plenty long and dry.

144
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,823
It'll be dry tonight,
but not too long.

145
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,072
29 is closed.

146
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:35,264
The pilot from your flight made
a shortcut across the field.

147
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,511
He didn't make it.

148
00:12:36,544 --> 00:12:37,760
What are you doing?

149
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:41,024
When the snow melts,
we'll get it out.

150
00:12:41,119 --> 00:12:42,784
What do you think I'm doing?!

151
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,832
Now, stop that, both of you!

152
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,447
It's a waste of time arguing
with a penguin. Good-bye.

153
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,623
Have a good flight.

154
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,864
What should I bring you
from Rome?

155
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,143
Just yourself.

156
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:57,184
If you have time,
I could use some white gloves.

157
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,103
Size 61/2, right?

158
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:00,384
No.

159
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,912
I'm the one who wears
size 71/2.

160
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,384
Hey, that's a good idea, Mel-

161
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,623
using little old ladies
for skycaps.

162
00:13:14,719 --> 00:13:16,767
You're doing a good job.

163
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,967
Mel.

164
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,728
For my sake,
be patient with him, hmm?

165
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,984
How can you live with that
overage juvenile delinquent?

166
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,024
If I left him,
what would I have?

167
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,263
What if he decided to leave you?

168
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:36,543
He won't.

169
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:39,904
A girl gets serious, he waves
his wedding ring like a flag.

170
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:41,824
I'm his disaster insurance.

171
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,904
More like group insurance.

172
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,504
Thanks for caring, Mel.

173
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,903
Don't worry.
Someday he'll come home...

174
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,944
for something other than
a change of clothes.

175
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,064
I hope so.

176
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,208
That's for me. Good-bye.

177
00:14:03,201 --> 00:14:04,288
Bakersfeld.

178
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,848
No, no.

179
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,184
I'll take care of it.

180
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,968
Vern! We don't have time.

181
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:51,264
I have a cab. We can make
the airport in 15 minutes.

182
00:14:51,361 --> 00:14:52,705
The driver will wait.

183
00:14:52,801 --> 00:14:54,624
His meter's running,
and so is mine.

184
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:56,064
I must finish packing.

185
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,785
Getting me up to full throttle,
then throwing me into reverse...

186
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:00,481
could damage my engine.

187
00:15:00,545 --> 00:15:03,584
We'll be in Rome tomorrow.
We'll have three days.

188
00:15:03,681 --> 00:15:04,865
Try a little patience.

189
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,368
Or a cold shower.

190
00:15:07,361 --> 00:15:09,185
Think about something else.

191
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:11,968
That I like.
You can see right through it.

192
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,464
Who's in the righthand seat?

193
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:15,585
I am.

194
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,866
Demoted?

195
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:19,585
It's a pilot check flight.
I'm checking Anson Harris.

196
00:15:19,682 --> 00:15:22,466
-He's been a captain for years.
-So have I.

197
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:24,385
You're checked out
every six months...

198
00:15:24,546 --> 00:15:27,329
to make sure you don't pick up
any bad habits.

199
00:15:29,281 --> 00:15:31,105
Such as nuzzling stewardesses?

200
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:34,530
Mm-hmm. Does he hold on
to the control too firmly?

201
00:15:35,521 --> 00:15:38,786
Or can he coax them along
with just his fingers?

202
00:15:38,881 --> 00:15:39,969
Ohh!

203
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:43,169
-We still have to-
-Go wash it.

204
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:46,785
When he's stacked up
and can't get clearance to land,

205
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:48,225
how does he take it?

206
00:16:10,081 --> 00:16:12,578
You and your roommate
have enough china, glasses,

207
00:16:12,642 --> 00:16:15,138
and booze for a round trip
to Australia.

208
00:16:15,202 --> 00:16:16,897
That's not all our loot.

209
00:16:16,962 --> 00:16:18,977
The girls in the building
have contributed.

210
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:21,569
Grace is getting married.
We're having a party.

211
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:25,058
You could hijack a 707
and start your own airline.

212
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:28,258
We thought of that, but none
of us has a pilot's license.

213
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,458
With the kind of fringe benefits
you girls can offer,

214
00:16:31,521 --> 00:16:34,210
I could get you a crew
right now.

215
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:54,338
Mel, Joe.
I'm stuck in traffic...

216
00:16:54,402 --> 00:16:56,899
on Carden Road,
just east of Mannheim.

217
00:16:56,962 --> 00:16:59,137
A tractor trailer jackknifed.

218
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:01,634
It's on its side
like a drunken dinosaur.

219
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,778
I need two-niner awful bad.

220
00:17:03,842 --> 00:17:07,394
If you're not out soon,
I'll get the Highway Patrol.

221
00:17:08,641 --> 00:17:10,114
What else can go wrong?

222
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:13,058
I better check the snow desk.
I'll be back soon.

223
00:17:13,123 --> 00:17:16,259
You're exhausted. You've been
rushing around for three days.

224
00:17:16,322 --> 00:17:18,819
-I've got to go.
-Why do everything yourself?

225
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:21,378
You've got an assistant.
Let Mike do it.

226
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:22,818
Sit down and relax.

227
00:17:22,883 --> 00:17:24,930
I'll fix you coffee
and a sandwich.

228
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:35,075
Oh... one thing you should do.

229
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:38,083
You promised to call
your wife back.

230
00:17:56,163 --> 00:17:58,019
Bakersfeld residence,
Libby speaking.

231
00:17:58,082 --> 00:17:59,618
This is Mr. Bakersfeld talking.

232
00:17:59,683 --> 00:18:02,498
Daddy! Isn't the snow super?

233
00:18:02,563 --> 00:18:05,219
Baby, it's cool, real cool.

234
00:18:05,282 --> 00:18:07,683
Robbie! Daddy's on the phone!

235
00:18:08,803 --> 00:18:09,859
Hello, Dad.

236
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:10,979
Hi, Robbie.

237
00:18:11,043 --> 00:18:12,578
Are you coming home tonight?

238
00:18:12,643 --> 00:18:15,235
Honey, I'm not so sure.
You see, I-

239
00:18:15,331 --> 00:18:17,699
Say good night, girls.
Mommy wants to talk.

240
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:18,851
Good night, Daddy.

241
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:20,931
Good night, Dad.

242
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:26,659
You hung up on me before.
Don't do that again.

243
00:18:26,722 --> 00:18:29,059
I'm sorry.
I was rushing to the field.

244
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:31,459
All right.
We don't have time to argue.

245
00:18:31,523 --> 00:18:34,339
You have a dinner jacket there.
Meet me at the hotel.

246
00:18:34,403 --> 00:18:36,739
I can't make it.
We've got an emergency.

247
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:39,138
I have to stay here
all night.

248
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:40,451
You can't.

249
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:43,299
You can't keep
doing this to me.

250
00:18:43,363 --> 00:18:45,859
Listen to me, Cindy.
In the past month,

251
00:18:45,923 --> 00:18:48,259
you've scheduled me
for seven charity wingdings.

252
00:18:48,323 --> 00:18:50,819
I've made four. That's not
a bad batting average.

253
00:18:50,883 --> 00:18:54,180
I'm not a ball game where
you keep score. I'm your wife.

254
00:18:54,243 --> 00:18:57,219
Then try to think of
my position for a change.

255
00:18:57,283 --> 00:18:59,939
I'm only thinking
about you.

256
00:19:00,003 --> 00:19:03,619
This isn't just another dinner.
Dad wants to talk to you.

257
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,659
He's been talking and I've
been saying no for 15 years.

258
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:09,219
Then why?
It's a wonderful opportunity.

259
00:19:09,284 --> 00:19:11,619
You two should have
gotten the message.

260
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:13,859
I'm not interested
in your father's job.

261
00:19:13,924 --> 00:19:16,260
I've been in navigation
for 20 years.

262
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:18,499
That's what I like,
and that's my life.

263
00:19:18,564 --> 00:19:20,419
Yes. What kind of a life?

264
00:19:20,483 --> 00:19:22,179
This would give you
regular hours.

265
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:24,900
We could be together
and with our children.

266
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,620
Your income would be
three times what it is.

267
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:30,019
Sure. We can join
the country club.

268
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,939
And what's wrong
with that?

269
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,540
Let's get something
straight.

270
00:19:33,603 --> 00:19:37,059
I'll support my family
on the income from my job.

271
00:19:37,124 --> 00:19:39,652
You don't give a damn
about our future.

272
00:19:40,323 --> 00:19:42,372
I'm just trying
to survive the present.

273
00:19:43,203 --> 00:19:45,380
Well, maybe you won't have to.

274
00:19:45,444 --> 00:19:48,132
-What the hell does that mean?
-Figure it out.

275
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:08,676
Why don't you have your coffee
in here and lie down?

276
00:20:09,764 --> 00:20:10,980
Guess what.

277
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,500
They just picked up a stowaway
from L. A. on flight 86.

278
00:20:14,564 --> 00:20:16,036
That's four this month.

279
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:18,819
BOAC had one on Monday,
a 16-year-old.

280
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,572
If you're wondering,
we didn't have another fight.

281
00:20:22,404 --> 00:20:24,292
It's a continuation
of the same one.

282
00:20:26,404 --> 00:20:28,484
But I'm as much to blame.

283
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:33,028
She's right. I look for excuses
not to go home.

284
00:20:35,684 --> 00:20:37,060
Hello, Joe?

285
00:20:37,124 --> 00:20:38,212
Oh, Harry.

286
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:41,380
All right, I'll be right there.

287
00:20:41,444 --> 00:20:44,740
-Get on the nose wheels.
-How deep should we go?

288
00:20:44,804 --> 00:20:48,292
You've got about three feet
at the wheels.

289
00:20:50,724 --> 00:20:54,500
The forecast is for it
to go on like this for days.

290
00:20:54,564 --> 00:20:57,541
We need a lot more men.

291
00:20:57,604 --> 00:20:59,460
I'll try to round up some.

292
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:01,060
Maybe there's an easier way.

293
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,292
Captain Demerest has
a good idea. Captain!

294
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:07,332
Tell Mr. Bakersfeld.

295
00:21:08,485 --> 00:21:11,301
My idea will make you
aviation man of the year,

296
00:21:11,366 --> 00:21:14,052
and Captain Benson
agrees with me.

297
00:21:14,821 --> 00:21:17,861
Put pneumatic jacks under
the jacking plates and lift her.

298
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:21,926
Then you fill in, plank over,
and roll her off on the flat.

299
00:21:22,021 --> 00:21:24,901
If every jack isn't absolutely
level, she'll slide off,

300
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:27,141
and you'll have a hole.

301
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:29,060
I'll stick with
Patroni's judgment.

302
00:21:29,093 --> 00:21:31,940
Do it the hard way,
but you better move this.

303
00:21:32,005 --> 00:21:33,700
I'm not taking off on 22.

304
00:21:33,764 --> 00:21:35,205
You'll use what's available.

305
00:21:35,301 --> 00:21:39,941
If it's 22, I'm not cutting back
on power over those houses.

306
00:21:40,005 --> 00:21:41,540
Unless you want a bill...

307
00:21:41,605 --> 00:21:43,621
for cracked plaster
and broken dishes,

308
00:21:43,685 --> 00:21:45,221
you'd better move this.

309
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:50,181
Keep digging.
Another pilot gets an idea,

310
00:21:50,245 --> 00:21:51,493
hand him a shovel.

311
00:21:56,486 --> 00:21:57,573
Yes, Peter?

312
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,453
Uh, Mrs. Livingston,
I've got that stowaway...

313
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:02,405
that Mr. Miller told you about.

314
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:04,133
Bring him in.

315
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:12,261
Hello. I'm Mrs. Ada Quonsett.

316
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:14,181
I'm Mrs. Livingston.
Pleased to-

317
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:16,421
I mean, won't you-
Sit down.

318
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:19,653
Thank you. It was a long walk
from that gate.

319
00:22:21,765 --> 00:22:24,454
We've got some talking to do.
Lock that door.

320
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:30,501
You've done
this sort of thing before.

321
00:22:30,565 --> 00:22:31,781
Yes, my dear.

322
00:22:31,846 --> 00:22:34,022
It's illegal.
Why do you do it?

323
00:22:34,085 --> 00:22:37,381
I'm a widow and have
a married daughter in New York.

324
00:22:37,446 --> 00:22:40,261
Sometimes I get lonely for her
and the grandchildren,

325
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:45,061
so I go to Los Angeles and get
on a plane going to New York.

326
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:48,229
When I'm ready to go home,
it's, well, vice versa.

327
00:22:48,293 --> 00:22:49,926
Without a ticket?

328
00:22:50,021 --> 00:22:52,101
I couldn't possibly afford
a ticket.

329
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:54,182
I just have
my social security...

330
00:22:54,245 --> 00:22:57,382
and the small pension
my late husband left me.

331
00:22:57,445 --> 00:22:59,494
Have you stowed away
on other airlines?

332
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,014
Oh, yes, but I like
Trans Global the best.

333
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:06,373
Well, it's nice to meet
a satisfied customer.

334
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,022
How about Patroni?

335
00:23:10,086 --> 00:23:11,941
Highway Patrol's
bringing him in.

336
00:23:12,006 --> 00:23:14,501
-How long before he's here?
-Half an hour.

337
00:23:14,566 --> 00:23:16,742
Good. Now I'll have
that sandwich.

338
00:23:16,806 --> 00:23:20,582
I'm starving. I haven't eaten
since about-Oh, I'm sorry.

339
00:23:20,646 --> 00:23:22,181
No, don't go away.

340
00:23:22,246 --> 00:23:24,422
I'd like you to meet
Mrs. Quonsett,

341
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,982
the stowaway
I was talking about before.

342
00:23:27,046 --> 00:23:30,982
This is Mr. Bakersfeld,
General Manager of the airport.

343
00:23:31,046 --> 00:23:32,742
Well, how do you do?

344
00:23:32,806 --> 00:23:35,815
It's a pleasure to meet
someone so important.

345
00:23:35,911 --> 00:23:37,542
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

346
00:23:37,606 --> 00:23:39,782
Don't go.
Come sit with us.

347
00:23:39,846 --> 00:23:42,662
Have a cup of coffee
and a sandwich.

348
00:23:42,726 --> 00:23:45,542
Perhaps Mr. Bakersfeld could
impress upon Mrs. Quonsett...

349
00:23:45,606 --> 00:23:47,942
that this isn't
a nice thing to do.

350
00:23:48,006 --> 00:23:50,374
Mrs. Livingston
hasn't been able to.

351
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:58,183
Uh, yes.
Uh... uh, Mrs. Quonsett,

352
00:23:58,278 --> 00:24:01,254
uh, what you've done
is, uh, is dishonest.

353
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,974
You've broken the law.

354
00:24:05,446 --> 00:24:07,335
You defrauded Trans Global.

355
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:10,823
They can prosecute you.

356
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:12,742
But they wouldn't, would they?

357
00:24:12,807 --> 00:24:16,262
It wouldn't be very good
public relations to prosecute

358
00:24:16,358 --> 00:24:19,142
a little old lady because she
wanted to visit her daughter.

359
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:26,182
-May I have one?
-Well, sure.

360
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,702
On the plane, the beef
was a little too well done,

361
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:32,582
and the salad dressing
had garlic in it.

362
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,438
You should tell them, my dear,

363
00:24:34,503 --> 00:24:38,182
that very often elderly people
can't tolerate garlic.

364
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:39,654
Gives them gas.

365
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,679
Well, I'll certainly mention it
to our chef. Thank you.

366
00:24:44,743 --> 00:24:46,503
Not at all.

367
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,038
Look, Mrs. Quonsett,

368
00:24:48,103 --> 00:24:51,463
since you've had so much
free travel from Trans Global,

369
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:54,823
at least you could tell us
how you get aboard.

370
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:58,983
Well, I use many methods, but I
like to be in the airport...

371
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:00,903
early enough to get
a boarding pass.

372
00:25:00,935 --> 00:25:03,176
But our boarding passes
are ticket folders.

373
00:25:03,271 --> 00:25:04,423
I know.

374
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:08,743
I go to a counter and say I've
lost mine and need another one.

375
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,623
The clerks are busy,
and lots of people are waiting.

376
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:12,935
They always give me one.

377
00:25:14,918 --> 00:25:18,503
It's just a blank folder.
It isn't made out as a pass.

378
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,614
I do that myself
in the ladies room.

379
00:25:21,479 --> 00:25:23,720
I know just what to write.

380
00:25:23,783 --> 00:25:27,143
I carry one of these black
pencils like the airlines use.

381
00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:28,423
-See?
-Yes, I do.

382
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:30,503
I'll keep that
if you don't mind.

383
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:33,224
It's really mine,
but if you want it,

384
00:25:33,319 --> 00:25:35,175
I can get another one.

385
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:38,951
So now you have a boarding pass.
What then?

386
00:25:38,983 --> 00:25:41,191
Then I go to the departure gate.

387
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:42,663
-Coffee?
-No, thank you.

388
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:45,223
I wait till the man
checking tickets is busy.

389
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:47,783
Then I walk past
and onto the plane.

390
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,959
Do you hear that, Mr. Coakley?

391
00:25:50,023 --> 00:25:52,423
No one stops you,
not even the stewardesses?

392
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:53,863
If you get on late,

393
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,063
they're hanging up coats
and talking to the men,

394
00:25:57,159 --> 00:26:02,023
and I just show them my folder
quickly, you see, like-

395
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,496
I'll keep that, too.

396
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:07,271
But I'm sure you don't always
use a boarding pass.

397
00:26:07,303 --> 00:26:10,824
No. Sometimes I tell them
that my son has gone aboard...

398
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,744
but he dropped his wallet.

399
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,744
I carry a man's wallet
in my hand...

400
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,104
That works best of all.

401
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,864
I must say, Mrs. Quonsett,

402
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,456
you have everything
figured out very carefully.

403
00:26:24,551 --> 00:26:26,984
My late husband taught me
to be thorough.

404
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,904
He was a teacher of geometry.

405
00:26:33,321 --> 00:26:36,904
My late husband was a lawyer,
and he always said,

406
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:41,960
Now I understand what he meant.

407
00:26:42,024 --> 00:26:43,464
You're a widow, too.

408
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:45,384
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear,

409
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,944
but you're young and attractive,
and I'm sure-

410
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,144
Let's confine the conversation
to you, Mrs. Quonsett.

411
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,120
We're sending you back to
Los Angeles on the next flight.

412
00:26:54,185 --> 00:26:56,136
Yes, I was afraid of that.

413
00:26:57,321 --> 00:27:01,224
I would like a cup of tea first,
so I'll go now.

414
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,952
When do you want me back?

415
00:27:02,984 --> 00:27:05,544
Oh, no, you're not going
anywhere alone.

416
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,625
Mrs. Quonsett will be
on flight 103.

417
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,120
Stick with her every second
until departure.

418
00:27:10,184 --> 00:27:13,225
-Don't lose sight of her.
-Ma'am, she'll need a ticket.

419
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,944
Yes. That will be a change,
won't it?

420
00:27:16,041 --> 00:27:17,704
I'll make out an order.

421
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,784
May I please have my tea now?

422
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,864
Yes, you-Where are you going?

423
00:27:21,961 --> 00:27:23,624
In the Commander's Club.

424
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,545
Mrs. Quonsett,
that's for members only.

425
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:27,273
But I have a card.

426
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,585
This card says
Mrs. Henry Jackson.

427
00:27:32,681 --> 00:27:35,560
My friend Gertrude lets me
use it when I'm traveling.

428
00:27:35,624 --> 00:27:39,305
We'll send it back to Gertrude
with a very strong letter.

429
00:27:39,401 --> 00:27:41,256
We'll go this way,
Mrs. Quonsett.

430
00:27:44,681 --> 00:27:45,737
Good-bye.

431
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,297
Good-bye, ma'am.

432
00:27:48,393 --> 00:27:51,336
You have been very nice.
Thank you.

433
00:27:57,802 --> 00:27:59,624
I don't believe it.

434
00:27:59,688 --> 00:28:01,544
I just don't believe it.

435
00:28:01,642 --> 00:28:04,584
You were a big help giving her
that VIP treatment-

436
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,505
deference, courtesy, sandwiches.

437
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,745
Why not break open
a bottle of champagne?

438
00:28:08,841 --> 00:28:11,625
If we had one, I would have.
She's fabulous.

439
00:28:11,721 --> 00:28:13,384
She just laughed at us.

440
00:28:13,481 --> 00:28:15,625
Take it easy.
There have been stowaways...

441
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:18,185
ever since the Egyptians
sailed the Red Sea.

442
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:20,745
When they caught them,
they tossed them overboard.

443
00:28:20,841 --> 00:28:23,465
The airlines won't do a thing,
and she knows it.

444
00:28:23,562 --> 00:28:25,065
Crafty little old biddy.

445
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:28,584
Come on. Relax. She only stole
a ride, not a plane.

446
00:28:28,681 --> 00:28:29,769
I know, but...

447
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:35,626
Mel, they've been
pressuring me...

448
00:28:35,721 --> 00:28:38,185
about that transfer
to San Francisco.

449
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:39,786
I think I'll take it.

450
00:28:39,881 --> 00:28:43,050
The pay is better.
The climate will do me good.

451
00:28:44,201 --> 00:28:45,386
No snow.

452
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:46,569
Yes.

453
00:28:48,041 --> 00:28:50,090
It's a beautiful city.
I'll miss you.

454
00:28:50,985 --> 00:28:53,449
Will you... enough
not to let me go?

455
00:28:54,825 --> 00:28:58,826
I'm sorry. You've been honest
with me from the beginning-

456
00:28:58,922 --> 00:29:01,225
no false hopes, no promises.

457
00:29:01,962 --> 00:29:04,105
I'm not as honest as you think.

458
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,889
I said I invented excuses
not to go home.

459
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:10,410
But I didn't mention why I stay.

460
00:29:14,602 --> 00:29:17,449
I tell myself I've got to
hold things together...

461
00:29:18,922 --> 00:29:20,490
for the children's sake.

462
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:24,425
But I'm not sure that's true
or even kind.

463
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:27,305
They know what's going on,
and it's hurting them,

464
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:28,490
especially Roberta.

465
00:29:30,121 --> 00:29:32,745
I think about
my mother and father, and...

466
00:29:32,843 --> 00:29:35,690
God knows they had
their ups and downs.

467
00:29:36,682 --> 00:29:39,850
But somehow they...
somehow they worked it out.

468
00:29:41,002 --> 00:29:44,330
I feel I should do the same,
or else I've failed.

469
00:29:44,906 --> 00:29:46,410
I don't like to fail.

470
00:29:49,962 --> 00:29:51,690
I don't know what to do.

471
00:29:54,411 --> 00:29:57,001
Maybe you love your wife
more than you realize.

472
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:58,986
No. No.

473
00:29:59,081 --> 00:30:00,650
Not for a long time.

474
00:30:01,483 --> 00:30:04,234
The only thing we've got
in common is our address.

475
00:30:07,403 --> 00:30:09,130
I'm not pressing you, Mel.

476
00:30:10,122 --> 00:30:12,170
I wouldn't play
that kind of game.

477
00:30:12,842 --> 00:30:15,690
But I better take
that job in San Francisco.

478
00:30:16,522 --> 00:30:17,770
Mrs. Livingston.

479
00:30:18,763 --> 00:30:21,227
-Yes?
-Excuse me, Mrs. Livingston,

480
00:30:21,322 --> 00:30:22,666
but customs just called.

481
00:30:22,762 --> 00:30:25,450
The chief wants you.
He says it's important.

482
00:30:25,962 --> 00:30:27,050
All right.

483
00:30:31,883 --> 00:30:34,186
One of our passengers
is demanding...

484
00:30:34,283 --> 00:30:37,226
to speak to someone in authority
from Trans Global.

485
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:47,626
Will you explain to this man
that this isn't the Dark Ages,

486
00:30:47,723 --> 00:30:49,867
that nowadays
stores in this country...

487
00:30:50,026 --> 00:30:52,074
import clothes from France?

488
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,890
If you'd look, you'd see
the Bergdorf Goodman labels.

489
00:30:55,242 --> 00:30:57,707
Oh, I did look, madam,
rather closely,

490
00:30:57,802 --> 00:31:00,586
and I find the sewing
of the labels...

491
00:31:00,683 --> 00:31:03,307
isn't up to Bergdorf's
usual standard.

492
00:31:03,402 --> 00:31:06,667
They're always
very professional, very neat.

493
00:31:06,763 --> 00:31:10,251
As you can see, that's...
that's a pretty sloppy job.

494
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:13,227
But I suppose everybody's
having trouble getting...

495
00:31:13,323 --> 00:31:14,795
good help these days.

496
00:31:14,891 --> 00:31:16,875
Especially the customs service.

497
00:31:24,843 --> 00:31:27,307
Well, what's the matter, boy?

498
00:31:27,402 --> 00:31:28,971
Is there something the matter?

499
00:31:29,483 --> 00:31:30,572
Huh?

500
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:33,707
Oh, your collar's too tight.

501
00:31:33,803 --> 00:31:35,787
Officer, about the fur
and the dresses,

502
00:31:35,883 --> 00:31:37,228
perhaps I made a mistake.

503
00:31:37,323 --> 00:31:40,490
I did buy them there,
and there are some other...

504
00:31:54,283 --> 00:31:55,532
I'm sorry, madam.

505
00:31:57,803 --> 00:32:00,939
Check everything else
very carefully.

506
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:03,979
Inspect the lining
of the bags and the cases.

507
00:32:04,043 --> 00:32:05,611
-Make a list.
-Yes, sir.

508
00:32:07,563 --> 00:32:08,843
Sorry, fella.

509
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:11,499
I'd like to change that
declaration, please, officer.

510
00:32:11,564 --> 00:32:13,579
I beg of you.
My husband will-

511
00:32:13,644 --> 00:32:16,492
Madam, please sit down.
This might take some time.

512
00:32:17,132 --> 00:32:18,508
When will they learn?

513
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:21,900
The duty would have been
1/10 of the fine.

514
00:32:21,963 --> 00:32:25,419
You are amazing. I never
would have suspected her.

515
00:32:25,484 --> 00:32:28,140
Well, after 30 years,
you kind of know.

516
00:32:28,203 --> 00:32:31,019
First I look in their eyes,
then the luggage.

517
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:32,300
Thanks for coming.

518
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:34,699
Now, may I ask you
another favor?

519
00:32:34,764 --> 00:32:37,739
If you want me to smuggle
anything, the answer is no.

520
00:32:37,803 --> 00:32:41,100
No. My sister's girl,
Judy Barton,

521
00:32:41,164 --> 00:32:43,980
will be on your number two
flight to Rome tonight.

522
00:32:44,044 --> 00:32:45,900
Can she have a window seat?

523
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:47,691
-I'm sure of it.
-Good.

524
00:32:48,363 --> 00:32:51,116
-Oh, uh, Mrs. Livingston.
-Yes?

525
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,581
Will it get off on time?

526
00:32:53,612 --> 00:32:55,020
Flight two, the Golden Argosy,

527
00:32:55,084 --> 00:32:57,356
will depart for Rome
on schedule.

528
00:32:57,452 --> 00:33:00,172
Good. Fine. Thank you.

529
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:26,060
I thought
you were leaving tomorrow.

530
00:34:26,125 --> 00:34:28,141
No. I have to start work
tomorrow.

531
00:34:28,205 --> 00:34:31,502
I got to be in Milwaukee
tonight. Remember?

532
00:34:31,564 --> 00:34:34,061
Is this another one of those
hello/good-bye jobs?

533
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,941
I talked to Mr. Williams
himself.

534
00:34:37,005 --> 00:34:39,021
175 a week.

535
00:34:39,085 --> 00:34:41,260
Look, this is
a 30-story building.

536
00:34:41,325 --> 00:34:44,461
The job will last, uh...
eight months at least.

537
00:34:44,525 --> 00:34:45,773
I hope so.

538
00:34:47,726 --> 00:34:50,061
This time do me one favor.

539
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:53,517
If your boss says two and two
is six, agree with him.

540
00:34:53,581 --> 00:34:57,837
Whatever way he wants to do
anything, that's my way.

541
00:34:57,934 --> 00:34:59,597
Don't lose your temper.

542
00:34:59,661 --> 00:35:02,701
And Williams said that
after the job in Milwaukee,

543
00:35:02,765 --> 00:35:03,982
they're building in Detroit,

544
00:35:04,046 --> 00:35:07,661
and he said they may subcontract
the excavating to me.

545
00:35:07,725 --> 00:35:09,421
Be satisfied
that you're working.

546
00:35:09,485 --> 00:35:11,021
I am, but you'll see.

547
00:35:11,085 --> 00:35:14,254
Everything will be fine,
the way it used to be.

548
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:19,054
Nothing's the way it used to be,
but I'm not complaining.

549
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:23,022
You never do. How you could
stick with me after-

550
00:35:23,086 --> 00:35:26,637
"FFor better or for worse. "F
I meant what I said.

551
00:35:26,701 --> 00:35:28,782
It will be better again.
I promise.

552
00:35:28,845 --> 00:35:31,822
I've got an idea
the kids won't have to live...

553
00:35:31,886 --> 00:35:34,541
with your sister anymore
and you'll have money...

554
00:35:34,606 --> 00:35:36,782
and a nice home and clothes.

555
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:39,981
Dom, stop dreaming.

556
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:42,286
Just hold on to the job.

557
00:35:44,045 --> 00:35:47,598
I'll do it right this time.
I won't mess it up.

558
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:56,302
How will you get to Milwaukee?

559
00:35:56,365 --> 00:35:59,021
The bus.
It leaves in a few minutes.

560
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:02,222
I've got enough for that.
Then I can draw in advance...

561
00:36:02,286 --> 00:36:04,014
on my salary tomorrow.

562
00:36:05,006 --> 00:36:08,846
But I will need something
for a hotel room tonight.

563
00:36:08,942 --> 00:36:09,966
If you could-

564
00:36:10,062 --> 00:36:12,750
All I've got
is enough for the rent.

565
00:36:13,486 --> 00:36:14,893
Yeah. All right.

566
00:36:16,525 --> 00:36:17,614
Dom...

567
00:36:18,766 --> 00:36:21,294
the silverware is gone.
My watch is gone.

568
00:36:23,246 --> 00:36:26,190
My mother's ring-
don't pawn that.

569
00:36:31,086 --> 00:36:34,702
Here. I can give the landlord
another hard-luck story.

570
00:36:40,686 --> 00:36:41,934
Good-bye, Dom.

571
00:36:43,566 --> 00:36:44,654
Inez...

572
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:51,022
I haven't been
a very good provider,

573
00:36:51,087 --> 00:36:53,710
but I will be.
I promise you that.

574
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:57,582
Good-bye, Inez.

575
00:36:57,646 --> 00:37:00,750
I love you. I want you
to always remember that.

576
00:37:19,247 --> 00:37:20,334
Good-bye.

577
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:43,855
$2.00.

578
00:37:44,526 --> 00:37:46,063
It's highway robbery.

579
00:37:46,127 --> 00:37:48,462
Why the airlines don't provide
free transportation...

580
00:37:48,527 --> 00:37:49,743
I'll never know.

581
00:37:49,807 --> 00:37:52,783
Mister, I just drive the bus.
You're holding up the line.

582
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:53,935
Here, here.

583
00:38:11,406 --> 00:38:12,815
Hi, Anson.

584
00:38:13,808 --> 00:38:16,687
Why are you here so early?
Trying to impress me?

585
00:38:16,783 --> 00:38:18,672
How about an "FA"F for effort?

586
00:38:18,703 --> 00:38:21,263
We're using 324 tonight.
On her last flight,

587
00:38:21,327 --> 00:38:23,183
number two engine
gave them trouble.

588
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:25,424
I wondered what
maintenance did about it.

589
00:38:25,488 --> 00:38:27,343
I hope we got a new one.

590
00:38:27,407 --> 00:38:30,223
They even replaced the wiring
to be on the safe side.

591
00:38:30,288 --> 00:38:32,335
That's the side I like.

592
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:34,703
What's the matter?

593
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:36,943
The last time
you checked me out,

594
00:38:37,008 --> 00:38:39,503
you marked me for not wearing
a regulation shirt.

595
00:38:39,568 --> 00:38:41,263
I was hoping to get even.

596
00:38:41,327 --> 00:38:44,303
Not a chance.
Knowing how tough you can be,

597
00:38:44,367 --> 00:38:46,383
tonight I even polished
my wings.

598
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:55,023
Thanks, fellas!

599
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:58,704
I tried to get more help, Joe,
but I only got 20 men.

600
00:38:58,767 --> 00:39:02,383
I did a little phoning
from my car. I got 50.

601
00:39:02,447 --> 00:39:03,984
Where'd you get them from?

602
00:39:04,048 --> 00:39:05,744
Braniff, Delta, Continental.

603
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:07,984
We're not like
those front office stiffs...

604
00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:11,183
who wear ties and steal
passengers from each other.

605
00:39:11,248 --> 00:39:13,104
Maintenance-it's like a circus.

606
00:39:13,168 --> 00:39:15,984
One of us gets in trouble,
they all come running.

607
00:39:16,047 --> 00:39:19,216
Let's go. I got a beautiful dame
waiting for me.

608
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:37,776
We should be above this
in about 20 minutes. Let's hope.

609
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:41,903
-Forget something?
-No.

610
00:39:41,968 --> 00:39:45,264
Just checking the Rome weather.
It's not too cold and sunny.

611
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:47,344
As usual, I've brought
the wrong clothes.

612
00:39:47,408 --> 00:39:50,416
-I don't have a thing to wear.
-Great.

613
00:39:54,223 --> 00:39:57,584
I'll have this mother out
by midnight, so stop worrying.

614
00:39:57,649 --> 00:39:59,984
The party starts at 12:01.

615
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:02,896
I'll settle for a box of cigars.
See you later.

616
00:40:06,481 --> 00:40:08,464
You keep leaning
on that shovel, Jack,

617
00:40:08,561 --> 00:40:10,544
you're going to freeze solid
like Lot's wife.

618
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:13,424
We want to move this airplane
before it becomes obsolete.

619
00:40:13,521 --> 00:40:15,824
The way you guys keep
heading for this bus...

620
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,065
looks like you got a broad
stashed in there!

621
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:20,016
Out! Everybody out!

622
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,264
P. A.: Attention.

623
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,153
Attention, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

624
00:40:31,185 --> 00:40:33,552
Trans Global Airlines
regrets to announce...

625
00:40:33,584 --> 00:40:35,025
that the Golden Argosy
flight two to Rome...

626
00:40:35,121 --> 00:40:37,136
will not depart until 11 p. m.

627
00:40:38,738 --> 00:40:41,584
We are indeed sorry,
but this is due solely...

628
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,504
to the condition
of the highways,

629
00:40:43,601 --> 00:40:44,945
which is causing
unavoidable delays...

630
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:46,192
in ground transportation.

631
00:40:46,224 --> 00:40:48,625
Those of you on flight two
to Rome, don't worry.

632
00:40:48,721 --> 00:40:49,937
They're going to hold the plane.

633
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:52,305
Just relax.
I'll get you there in time.

634
00:40:52,401 --> 00:40:54,865
They could have decided that
before we left the terminal.

635
00:40:54,961 --> 00:40:56,945
Making us sit here and worry-
it's inexcusable.

636
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:59,858
-Go away. Your nose is running.
-No!

637
00:41:18,385 --> 00:41:20,497
Of course,
if it's not crowded, I...

638
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:25,745
Here's the ticket.
It's flight 103.

639
00:41:25,841 --> 00:41:28,177
-Oh, thank you.
-Oh, no, you don't.

640
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:33,777
My, she has a suspicious nature.

641
00:41:34,481 --> 00:41:36,305
Well, go on.
You were saying...

642
00:41:36,401 --> 00:41:38,385
you prefer the flights
that aren't direct.

643
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:41,425
Yes. That's why your flight 86
is my favorite-

644
00:41:41,521 --> 00:41:44,081
St. Louis, Kansas City, Chicago.

645
00:41:44,145 --> 00:41:45,905
Yes, but I should think
they check...

646
00:41:46,001 --> 00:41:47,186
at all the intermediate stops.

647
00:41:47,282 --> 00:41:50,705
I pretend to be asleep.
Usually they don't disturb me.

648
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:52,017
But this time they caught you.

649
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:54,865
It was that man
sitting next to me.

650
00:41:54,962 --> 00:41:56,466
I confided in him,

651
00:41:56,561 --> 00:41:59,345
and he betrayed me
to the stewardess.

652
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:01,938
He was a policeman
from San Diego.

653
00:42:02,802 --> 00:42:06,386
I think they should make them
always wear their uniforms.

654
00:42:06,481 --> 00:42:08,658
Otherwise,
how's a person to know?

655
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:14,226
Hi, Mel. I was just
going to have you paged.

656
00:42:14,322 --> 00:42:17,106
-I had to go out in the field.
-We got trouble, Mel.

657
00:42:17,202 --> 00:42:19,345
I talked to the lawyer
for those Meadowood people,

658
00:42:19,442 --> 00:42:21,105
and he says
unless we stop planes...

659
00:42:21,202 --> 00:42:23,185
from taking off
over their houses by midnight,

660
00:42:23,282 --> 00:42:24,786
he's starting a damage suit...

661
00:42:24,882 --> 00:42:27,954
first thing in the morning
for $10 million.

662
00:42:28,081 --> 00:42:31,026
That's a nice round figure.
He hasn't got a prayer.

663
00:42:31,122 --> 00:42:33,234
He might not win,
but he can sue.

664
00:42:33,266 --> 00:42:34,545
Any legal action
will only make...

665
00:42:34,643 --> 00:42:37,106
our public relations
worse than they already are,

666
00:42:37,202 --> 00:42:39,506
and that's something
the other commissioners and I...

667
00:42:39,602 --> 00:42:40,817
don't want to risk.

668
00:42:42,481 --> 00:42:43,826
What do you propose to do
about it?

669
00:42:43,922 --> 00:42:46,385
Well, there's only one answer-
shut down runway 22...

670
00:42:46,482 --> 00:42:47,954
and cut out the noise
over Meadowood.

671
00:42:48,018 --> 00:42:49,266
And with two-niner out,

672
00:42:49,362 --> 00:42:51,025
that means closing down
the airport completely.

673
00:42:51,122 --> 00:42:52,275
Only until morning.

674
00:42:52,306 --> 00:42:54,706
After all, you've promised them
dozens of times...

675
00:42:54,803 --> 00:42:56,146
you wouldn't disturb
their sleep.

676
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,386
I promised we wouldn't take off
over their houses...

677
00:42:58,482 --> 00:42:59,666
unless there was an emergency,

678
00:42:59,762 --> 00:43:01,426
and I promised them
something else:

679
00:43:01,523 --> 00:43:02,706
In the foreseeable future,

680
00:43:02,802 --> 00:43:04,594
the noise problem would not
get any better.

681
00:43:04,659 --> 00:43:07,506
If you don't want to spend
a couple of months in court,

682
00:43:07,602 --> 00:43:09,138
you better start
conning them a little.

683
00:43:09,682 --> 00:43:11,634
You think lying to them
is the answer?

684
00:43:11,698 --> 00:43:13,074
Oh, Mel.

685
00:43:13,106 --> 00:43:14,418
There's your answer.

686
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:17,906
A modern expanded airport
big and efficient enough...

687
00:43:18,002 --> 00:43:20,306
to take anything
the designers can throw at us.

688
00:43:20,402 --> 00:43:22,066
That means buying off
Meadowood...

689
00:43:22,162 --> 00:43:23,666
and rezoning it
for industrial use...

690
00:43:23,762 --> 00:43:25,266
so the noise won't make
any difference.

691
00:43:25,363 --> 00:43:28,595
I didn't come here to talk
about the future of aviation.

692
00:43:28,659 --> 00:43:29,747
Well, you better start,

693
00:43:29,842 --> 00:43:31,698
and you better start
looking ahead a few years.

694
00:43:31,794 --> 00:43:32,947
What are we going to do...

695
00:43:33,042 --> 00:43:35,186
about these jumbos
that seat 500 passengers?

696
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:37,938
How will we get people
to and from the airport?

697
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:40,946
Save that for the women's clubs
and the Rotary luncheons.

698
00:43:41,042 --> 00:43:42,226
We've got to be practical.

699
00:43:42,322 --> 00:43:44,947
Sure, sure, ignore it.
Don't stick your neck out.

700
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:47,506
It's about time that you
and the other commissioners...

701
00:43:47,603 --> 00:43:48,946
began fighting
for a bond issue...

702
00:43:49,042 --> 00:43:50,835
to finance this kind
of an airport...

703
00:43:50,898 --> 00:43:52,306
instead of running around...

704
00:43:52,403 --> 00:43:54,226
checking to see
if the toilets flush.

705
00:43:54,323 --> 00:43:56,627
I don't think insulting me is
going to solve anything,

706
00:43:56,722 --> 00:43:58,355
so let's get back
to our immediate problem.

707
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:01,106
We've got to make a decision
about tonight!

708
00:44:01,203 --> 00:44:03,155
I've made it.
The airport's staying open.

709
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:05,715
Mel, stop being so bullheaded.
Think of the consequences.

710
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:07,187
Don't talk to me
about consequences.

711
00:44:07,282 --> 00:44:10,067
When Congress voted to cut
airport appropriations,

712
00:44:10,162 --> 00:44:12,467
you never even sent in
a letter of protest.

713
00:44:12,626 --> 00:44:14,386
Where were you when the airlines
and the pilots...

714
00:44:14,483 --> 00:44:16,306
and the rest of us
were pleading...

715
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,387
for more airports
and better traffic control?

716
00:44:18,483 --> 00:44:21,106
You were picking out the colors
in the ladies lounge.

717
00:44:21,203 --> 00:44:22,834
So now you've got
your consequences-

718
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:25,587
congested air traffic
where Sunday pilots hold up...

719
00:44:25,683 --> 00:44:27,507
airliners with thousands
of people aboard...

720
00:44:27,603 --> 00:44:30,067
and force us to stack up
planes bound for New York...

721
00:44:30,163 --> 00:44:31,411
as far away as Denver.

722
00:44:31,475 --> 00:44:33,907
When it comes to politics,
you're a child.

723
00:44:34,003 --> 00:44:36,147
Two of our councilmen
live in Meadowood.

724
00:44:36,244 --> 00:44:38,228
Think what they could do
to us downtown!

725
00:44:38,324 --> 00:44:40,787
I'm thinking of those pilots
upstairs waiting to land,

726
00:44:40,883 --> 00:44:42,227
flying blind in that muck...

727
00:44:42,323 --> 00:44:45,106
and circling in holding patterns
and praying to God...

728
00:44:45,203 --> 00:44:47,347
that some tired, overworked,
underpaid controller...

729
00:44:47,443 --> 00:44:48,467
in the tower...

730
00:44:48,563 --> 00:44:50,292
doesn't have another plane
on the same course.

731
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:52,787
You can call it pigheaded.
Call it anything you want.

732
00:44:52,883 --> 00:44:54,706
As long as we're not
below F. A. A. minimums,

733
00:44:54,804 --> 00:44:55,891
we're not closing down.

734
00:44:57,684 --> 00:44:59,667
All right,
if that's the way you want it.

735
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,107
I'm calling
the other commissioners,

736
00:45:01,204 --> 00:45:03,187
and I'll let you know
what our decision is...

737
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,307
within an hour.

738
00:45:04,404 --> 00:45:06,068
That's your privilege.
You hired me,

739
00:45:06,164 --> 00:45:07,507
and you've got
the right to fire me,

740
00:45:07,603 --> 00:45:09,971
but until you do,
this airport is staying open.

741
00:45:56,852 --> 00:45:58,708
Do you wish to make
a reservation?

742
00:45:58,804 --> 00:46:01,107
No, I don't.
Could you please tell me...

743
00:46:01,203 --> 00:46:03,188
if there's a flight to Rome
tonight?

744
00:46:03,283 --> 00:46:05,589
Yes, our Golden Argosy
flight two.

745
00:46:05,684 --> 00:46:07,028
It departs at 10 p. m.

746
00:46:07,123 --> 00:46:08,627
Only tonight,
it's delayed one hour...

747
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:10,388
due to weather conditions.

748
00:46:10,484 --> 00:46:12,788
Well, could you-
it's very important to me...

749
00:46:12,884 --> 00:46:14,708
to find out if somebody's
on that flight.

750
00:46:14,804 --> 00:46:17,108
His name is D. O. Guerrero.

751
00:46:17,204 --> 00:46:18,388
I'm terribly sorry.

752
00:46:18,483 --> 00:46:20,308
We're not allowed to give out
that information.

753
00:46:20,404 --> 00:46:21,909
You don't understand.

754
00:46:22,004 --> 00:46:23,988
The person I'm asking about
is my husband.

755
00:46:24,084 --> 00:46:26,868
I am sorry,
but it's a company rule.

756
00:46:26,964 --> 00:46:28,788
You might go out to the airport.

757
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:31,349
If you can get there
before they board the flight,

758
00:46:31,445 --> 00:46:33,108
you could see your husband
if he's there.

759
00:46:33,205 --> 00:46:37,172
I see. Well, if that's
the only way, I suppose.

760
00:46:37,684 --> 00:46:40,308
Thank you. Thank you.

761
00:46:40,405 --> 00:46:42,452
Thank you for calling
Trans Global.

762
00:46:57,429 --> 00:46:59,412
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

763
00:47:00,245 --> 00:47:03,573
I tried, but we were in a hurry,
and...

764
00:47:04,245 --> 00:47:05,492
You're sure?

765
00:47:06,005 --> 00:47:07,669
Do you mean
am I sure I'm pregnant...

766
00:47:07,765 --> 00:47:10,068
or am I sure you're the father?

767
00:47:10,165 --> 00:47:11,508
Come on, Gwen. I didn't-

768
00:47:11,605 --> 00:47:13,237
The answer
to both questions is yes.

769
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:14,549
You know I wasn't asking-

770
00:47:14,644 --> 00:47:15,925
You have a perfect right to.

771
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:18,454
I want you to know
something, Vern...

772
00:47:19,445 --> 00:47:21,492
that there hasn't been
anyone else but you.

773
00:47:22,804 --> 00:47:25,236
You see, there couldn't be.
I happen to love you.

774
00:47:27,925 --> 00:47:29,429
I'm afraid I was careless.

775
00:47:29,524 --> 00:47:30,869
I stopped taking the pills...

776
00:47:30,965 --> 00:47:32,854
because they were making me
gain weight,

777
00:47:32,917 --> 00:47:35,637
so instead of being plump,
I'm pregnant.

778
00:47:37,365 --> 00:47:39,413
Stop twisting your wedding ring.

779
00:47:39,926 --> 00:47:43,253
I know you've got a wife.
I know you can't marry me.

780
00:47:44,085 --> 00:47:45,493
I knew it in the beginning.

781
00:47:47,765 --> 00:47:49,493
I won't make things
difficult for you.

782
00:47:50,005 --> 00:47:51,348
I'll work it out myself.

783
00:47:51,445 --> 00:47:52,629
Don't be ridiculous, Gwen.

784
00:47:52,725 --> 00:47:55,604
You don't think I'd walk out
and ignore the whole thing?

785
00:47:55,669 --> 00:47:56,950
I'll take care of you.

786
00:47:57,045 --> 00:47:58,549
I'll make sure you don't go...

787
00:47:58,645 --> 00:48:01,173
to some butcher
two flights up over a drugstore.

788
00:48:01,749 --> 00:48:03,861
I hear Sweden's the best place.

789
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:07,029
Good doctors, good hospitals,
medically safe.

790
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:09,173
Very quick, very simple.

791
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:11,893
One minute you have it,
next minute you don't.

792
00:48:12,725 --> 00:48:14,582
There's no danger
of complications.

793
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:16,853
That is,
no physical complications.

794
00:48:17,685 --> 00:48:20,182
I'm not so sure
about the moral ones.

795
00:48:21,045 --> 00:48:23,221
You have religious scruples?

796
00:48:23,285 --> 00:48:25,174
No, no...

797
00:48:26,646 --> 00:48:28,662
but the strangest thing
happened to me today...

798
00:48:28,726 --> 00:48:29,973
when the doctor told me.

799
00:48:30,486 --> 00:48:33,141
I've known other girls
in the same situation...

800
00:48:33,205 --> 00:48:35,221
toss it off with bad jokes...

801
00:48:35,285 --> 00:48:36,981
like "Fl've got a bun
in the oven... "F

802
00:48:37,045 --> 00:48:39,894
or "FCaptain, we've got
an extra passenger on board. "F

803
00:48:40,726 --> 00:48:42,741
I knew I'd react the same way...

804
00:48:43,286 --> 00:48:45,493
very modern, very sophisticated.

805
00:48:48,246 --> 00:48:49,494
But I certainly didn't.

806
00:48:51,445 --> 00:48:55,094
I was suddenly filled
with a sense of wonder and awe.

807
00:48:55,926 --> 00:48:58,038
I don't want to sound
mystical or anything,

808
00:48:58,135 --> 00:49:02,134
but I am carrying someone
who's part of us.

809
00:49:03,446 --> 00:49:05,494
I'm not so sure
I want to lose it.

810
00:49:07,287 --> 00:49:09,782
And if you have the baby,
then what?

811
00:49:12,406 --> 00:49:15,574
Well, I suppose adoption
would be the answer.

812
00:49:16,726 --> 00:49:18,903
They're very careful nowadays.

813
00:49:18,966 --> 00:49:20,278
They find the right family.

814
00:49:20,342 --> 00:49:21,462
They're very careful,

815
00:49:21,526 --> 00:49:23,574
and all the arrangements
are made beforehand...

816
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,774
and the records are kept secret,
you know...

817
00:49:27,766 --> 00:49:29,654
and you'll never see the baby.

818
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:38,422
I suppose in time
I'll be sensible,

819
00:49:38,486 --> 00:49:40,694
but I've got to have time
to think.

820
00:49:47,926 --> 00:49:50,454
Vern, thank you for caring.

821
00:49:52,087 --> 00:49:55,094
Most men would have said,
"FSo long, girl. Tough luck. "F

822
00:49:56,087 --> 00:49:57,495
Not this one.

823
00:50:05,686 --> 00:50:08,375
You know, I think
you really do love me a little.

824
00:50:10,167 --> 00:50:12,054
It makes it harder to decide...

825
00:50:13,047 --> 00:50:14,455
but easier to bear.

826
00:50:22,646 --> 00:50:24,022
Is something wrong, Gwen?

827
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:26,263
The air vent was stuck.
The captain fixed it.

828
00:50:26,326 --> 00:50:27,254
Oh.

829
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:40,055
Full throttle!

830
00:50:49,303 --> 00:50:50,775
All the way!

831
00:51:06,776 --> 00:51:08,184
You chickened out on me.

832
00:51:08,247 --> 00:51:09,944
I said I wanted
all the power you got.

833
00:51:10,007 --> 00:51:12,183
At full throttle, this plane
would be standing on its nose.

834
00:51:12,247 --> 00:51:14,263
You might fly these things,
but I take them apart...

835
00:51:14,327 --> 00:51:15,703
and put them
back together again.

836
00:51:15,767 --> 00:51:17,623
If you had any guts,
we'd be on the runway by now.

837
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:18,903
You felt it vibrating.

838
00:51:18,967 --> 00:51:21,463
Another 10 seconds,
we'd have had structural damage.

839
00:51:21,528 --> 00:51:24,664
You're not talking
to some kid that fixes bicycles.

840
00:51:24,727 --> 00:51:26,583
I know every inch of the 707.

841
00:51:26,647 --> 00:51:29,143
Take the wings off this,
and you could use it as a tank.

842
00:51:29,208 --> 00:51:31,384
This plane is built
to withstand anything...

843
00:51:31,447 --> 00:51:32,983
except a bad pilot.

844
00:51:33,047 --> 00:51:34,264
All right, hold it.

845
00:51:34,327 --> 00:51:35,704
This kind of talk
will get us nowhere.

846
00:51:35,768 --> 00:51:37,623
You might tell your mechanic...

847
00:51:37,687 --> 00:51:39,224
I've got over three million
miles in the air.

848
00:51:39,288 --> 00:51:40,984
And 21/2 feet
in the ground.

849
00:51:41,047 --> 00:51:43,735
Let's stop wasting time!
What do we do now?

850
00:51:44,504 --> 00:51:47,223
Now we got to dig a lot deeper,
put lumber under the wheels,

851
00:51:47,288 --> 00:51:48,503
but the next time we try,

852
00:51:48,568 --> 00:51:50,136
since he's afraid,
I'll drive it out.

853
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,863
I'm not turning this ship
over to anybody...

854
00:51:51,928 --> 00:51:53,624
without authorization
from our chief pilot.

855
00:51:53,688 --> 00:51:55,703
I phoned Kettering,
but there's no answer.

856
00:51:55,768 --> 00:51:57,624
We'll just sit here and wait
till you get him.

857
00:51:57,687 --> 00:51:59,224
No, we don't.
We haven't got time.

858
00:51:59,287 --> 00:52:00,504
You're not in the air, Captain.

859
00:52:00,567 --> 00:52:01,784
You're on the ground-
my ground-

860
00:52:01,848 --> 00:52:03,383
and you're blocking
my primary runway.

861
00:52:03,447 --> 00:52:05,944
I'm not using full power.
It's too risky.

862
00:52:06,007 --> 00:52:07,383
Then I'll make the decision.

863
00:52:07,448 --> 00:52:09,624
I'll take the responsibility
for the aircraft.

864
00:52:09,689 --> 00:52:11,736
Mr. Patroni is licensed to taxi.
He'll take over.

865
00:52:27,928 --> 00:52:29,144
If he tears this ship apart,

866
00:52:29,207 --> 00:52:31,096
you better have eight million
to pay for it.

867
00:52:36,568 --> 00:52:40,184
Joe, my neck's out
about 14 feet.

868
00:52:40,248 --> 00:52:41,496
Sure it will work?

869
00:52:42,008 --> 00:52:43,225
Buzz, put it this way.

870
00:52:43,288 --> 00:52:45,784
You promised me a box of cigars
if I pull this off.

871
00:52:45,848 --> 00:52:47,895
What are you standing here for?
Go get them.

872
00:52:53,688 --> 00:52:57,144
Bus from the downtown terminal
is just coming in.

873
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:58,872
P. A.: Your attention, please.

874
00:52:58,936 --> 00:53:00,984
Trans Global Airlines'
the Golden Argosy...

875
00:53:01,048 --> 00:53:04,345
flight two nonstop to Rome
is now ready for boarding.

876
00:53:04,409 --> 00:53:06,425
All passengers holding
confirmed reservations,

877
00:53:06,488 --> 00:53:10,137
please proceed to gate 33,
green concourse "FD."F

878
00:53:19,448 --> 00:53:20,856
Oh, Rome.

879
00:53:22,649 --> 00:53:25,177
The Colosseum,
the Sistine Chapel...

880
00:53:25,848 --> 00:53:27,417
the Catacombs.

881
00:53:28,568 --> 00:53:32,505
My dear late husband and I
always planned to visit there.

882
00:53:32,568 --> 00:53:35,417
"FSee Rome and die,"F
he always said...

883
00:53:36,408 --> 00:53:39,417
but he died
just when we were packing.

884
00:53:39,512 --> 00:53:40,665
Oh, gee, that's too bad.

885
00:53:40,729 --> 00:53:44,536
Yes. So near, and yet so far.

886
00:53:53,529 --> 00:53:54,617
What's wrong?

887
00:53:55,448 --> 00:53:57,145
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

888
00:53:57,209 --> 00:53:59,226
-What is it, Mrs. Quonsett?
-Oh, I'm sorry.

889
00:53:59,288 --> 00:54:01,464
I'm sorry. I'm afraid
I'm having one of my spells.

890
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:03,065
I'll get help.
I'll call for a doctor.

891
00:54:03,129 --> 00:54:04,985
Oh, it's-I'll be all right.

892
00:54:05,048 --> 00:54:08,825
I've had them for years.
It will pass.

893
00:54:08,888 --> 00:54:12,376
Oh, dear! If I could just
lie down for a little while.

894
00:54:13,048 --> 00:54:17,657
I saw a cot in the ladies room
a little while ago.

895
00:54:18,649 --> 00:54:19,673
I'll help you.
Come on.

896
00:54:20,409 --> 00:54:21,498
Take it easy.

897
00:54:23,769 --> 00:54:25,306
Are you sure you're
going to be all right?

898
00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:27,033
Sit down along the way
if you're not.

899
00:54:36,089 --> 00:54:37,945
You'll be all right.
We'll be there in a second.

900
00:54:38,009 --> 00:54:39,865
I'm much better-much better.

901
00:54:39,929 --> 00:54:41,785
Are you sure you don't want me
to call for the doctor?

902
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:43,865
Oh, no.
I'm in enough trouble already.

903
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:45,305
But-but don't go away.

904
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:48,026
You will stay right here
like you did before, won't you?

905
00:54:48,089 --> 00:54:49,497
Oh, certainly.
I'll stay right here.

906
00:54:55,929 --> 00:54:57,946
Perhaps you're right.
You better get a doctor.

907
00:54:58,009 --> 00:54:59,098
Of course, right away.

908
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:03,065
But don't worry.
I'll be all right.

909
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,345
There's an attendant in there.

910
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:06,457
She'll take care of you.
I won't be a minute.

911
00:55:08,250 --> 00:55:09,337
Thank you.

912
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:37,786
Uh, that is E-R-O.

913
00:55:37,851 --> 00:55:40,666
And what amount policy were you
considering, Mr. Guerrero?

914
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:43,194
Uh, 150,000.

915
00:55:43,258 --> 00:55:45,305
-That will be $5.00.
-Yes, I know.

916
00:55:45,370 --> 00:55:49,306
But for $2.50 more,
you could take out 225,000.

917
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:51,386
It isn't much extra
for all that protection.

918
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:53,306
I don't know
if I have that much left-

919
00:55:53,371 --> 00:55:56,187
American money. I exchanged
all my dollars to lira.

920
00:55:56,282 --> 00:55:57,658
Oh, we accept foreign currency.

921
00:55:57,754 --> 00:56:01,018
Yeah, well, I've got that
all in big bills.

922
00:56:01,114 --> 00:56:02,586
We'll take a personal check
if you like.

923
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,666
No. When I go to Europe,

924
00:56:04,762 --> 00:56:07,067
I always leave my checkbook
at home.

925
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:09,627
You know, it's too much
of a temptation.

926
00:56:09,722 --> 00:56:11,578
Oh, wait a minute.
I may have enough.

927
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:14,267
I didn't mean to push you,

928
00:56:14,362 --> 00:56:15,866
but we're having
a sales contest,

929
00:56:15,962 --> 00:56:17,627
and I've got a chance
for the prize.

930
00:56:17,723 --> 00:56:19,066
Every little bit helps.

931
00:56:19,163 --> 00:56:21,146
Yeah. Could you
hurry that up, please?

932
00:56:21,243 --> 00:56:22,586
They've already
called my flight.

933
00:56:22,682 --> 00:56:24,699
Oh, just the first call.
You still have time.

934
00:56:33,722 --> 00:56:36,155
But I distinctly asked
for the fourth row.

935
00:56:38,523 --> 00:56:41,146
I'm terribly sorry.
This is the best we can do.

936
00:56:41,242 --> 00:56:42,939
Well, give it to me.

937
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:47,067
Did you say this is
some kind of exchange program?

938
00:56:47,162 --> 00:56:50,107
Yes. You see, the Italian girl
would be living with my folks,

939
00:56:50,203 --> 00:56:51,546
and then I'll be living
with them.

940
00:56:51,643 --> 00:56:53,499
Oh, well, that should be
quite an experience.

941
00:57:09,882 --> 00:57:12,155
I'm sorry.
Could you hurry, please?

942
00:57:12,219 --> 00:57:14,939
There's the terminal, lady,
over there.

943
00:57:15,035 --> 00:57:16,667
Just be a couple more
minutes now.

944
00:57:18,075 --> 00:57:20,827
How about letting me
buy you a cup of coffee?

945
00:57:20,923 --> 00:57:24,027
Good. Mr. Bakersfeld's in there
having dinner. We can join him.

946
00:57:24,123 --> 00:57:25,467
Let me check
the calendar first.

947
00:57:25,563 --> 00:57:26,587
Right.

948
00:57:26,684 --> 00:57:28,987
Here you are, sir. Seat 23A.
Have a good flight.

949
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:29,979
Thank you.

950
00:57:33,404 --> 00:57:35,707
Just two no-shows
in first class, huh?

951
00:57:35,803 --> 00:57:38,107
They've been waiting
in the Commander's Club.

952
00:57:40,763 --> 00:57:44,539
Oh, no. No. I'm just a visitor.
I work downstairs.

953
00:57:45,243 --> 00:57:46,619
Oh. Sorry.

954
00:57:54,043 --> 00:57:55,707
Ready?

955
00:57:55,803 --> 00:57:58,907
Did you see that man
with the attaché case just now?

956
00:57:59,003 --> 00:57:59,899
No.

957
00:58:00,924 --> 00:58:04,828
Well, if he were coming in from
abroad instead of going out,

958
00:58:04,923 --> 00:58:06,588
I'd want to inspect it.

959
00:58:06,683 --> 00:58:08,028
Do you think he's smuggling?

960
00:58:08,123 --> 00:58:11,228
It was the way he held the case,
the look in his eye.

961
00:58:11,323 --> 00:58:13,180
He tried to hand me
his ticket...

962
00:58:24,988 --> 00:58:26,748
Sorry about the delay,
Mr. Donovan.

963
00:58:26,843 --> 00:58:28,828
-That's all right, Mike.
-Excuse me, young man.

964
00:58:28,924 --> 00:58:30,747
My son dropped this.
All his money's in it.

965
00:58:30,844 --> 00:58:32,187
He just went on board.

966
00:58:32,283 --> 00:58:34,587
Blond hair, no hat,
camel's hair coat. I wonder-

967
00:58:34,684 --> 00:58:36,188
I'm not allowed to accept
a wallet.

968
00:58:36,284 --> 00:58:37,628
See the stewardess
about it, please.

969
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:38,620
Oh.

970
00:59:25,564 --> 00:59:28,028
But, you see,
if someone is smuggling,

971
00:59:28,124 --> 00:59:30,589
they usually start
to get nervous when they land,

972
00:59:30,685 --> 00:59:33,469
not before they take off.
This guy was really shaky.

973
00:59:33,565 --> 00:59:35,229
If it's contraband
and he's a trembler,

974
00:59:35,325 --> 00:59:37,309
Italian customs will nail him.

975
00:59:37,405 --> 00:59:39,549
There's not much we can
do about it here.

976
00:59:39,644 --> 00:59:41,820
I don't know. I think
somebody ought to.

977
00:59:43,005 --> 00:59:44,509
Maybe you should
tell your boss,

978
00:59:44,604 --> 00:59:46,556
in case he wants
to notify the captain.

979
00:59:47,484 --> 00:59:50,141
I guess you're right.
Be right back.

980
00:59:55,485 --> 00:59:58,588
P. A.: Braniff International
flight 49 for Dallas...

981
00:59:58,685 --> 01:00:00,828
now boarding at gate 19,

982
01:00:00,924 --> 01:00:02,588
the red concourse.

983
01:00:02,684 --> 01:00:04,989
All passengers holding
confirmed reservations...

984
01:00:05,084 --> 01:00:09,213
please proceed to gate 19,
the red concourse.

985
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:49,854
23B?

986
01:00:50,365 --> 01:00:52,092
Oh, yes. Right here.

987
01:01:10,046 --> 01:01:11,709
What are you doing here?

988
01:01:11,805 --> 01:01:13,054
She got away.

989
01:01:13,117 --> 01:01:14,270
She what?

990
01:01:14,365 --> 01:01:16,349
Well, what she did was-
we were-

991
01:01:16,445 --> 01:01:18,110
I don't care how she got away.

992
01:01:18,206 --> 01:01:20,349
Get on that phone
and call every airline.

993
01:01:20,445 --> 01:01:22,493
I'll see if security
can round her up.

994
01:01:27,165 --> 01:01:29,150
Forward jetway still in place.

995
01:01:29,245 --> 01:01:30,973
Your decision, Captain.

996
01:01:31,645 --> 01:01:33,054
Make some noise.

997
01:01:44,606 --> 01:01:45,630
Miss Meighen?

998
01:01:46,366 --> 01:01:48,190
Yes, Captain?

999
01:01:48,285 --> 01:01:49,630
What's the delay?

1000
01:01:49,726 --> 01:01:51,517
The tourist head count
won't tally.

1001
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:53,245
Where's the ramp supervisor?

1002
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,295
-He's back there counting.
-Get him.

1003
01:02:02,367 --> 01:02:04,158
The plane to Rome-
is it gone yet?

1004
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:05,309
-No, but hurry.
-Which way?

1005
01:02:05,405 --> 01:02:07,070
Go through there
and turn right.

1006
01:02:07,166 --> 01:02:09,374
-Green concourse, gate 33.
-Thank you.

1007
01:02:11,518 --> 01:02:13,310
I know you got problems,
and so have we,

1008
01:02:13,406 --> 01:02:15,006
but how long will we
sit here?

1009
01:02:15,038 --> 01:02:16,511
I've just ordered
a ticket recheck.

1010
01:02:16,606 --> 01:02:19,006
We should have 81.
It seems we've got 82.

1011
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:21,310
Every second, we're burning fuel
on three and four-

1012
01:02:21,407 --> 01:02:23,070
which you gave the OK
to start-

1013
01:02:23,166 --> 01:02:24,510
precious fuel
that we'll need tonight.

1014
01:02:24,606 --> 01:02:25,630
I know, Captain, but-

1015
01:02:25,726 --> 01:02:27,071
Unless this plane leaves
right now,

1016
01:02:27,166 --> 01:02:28,191
I'm going to
shut everything down...

1017
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,559
and send for fueling
to top off our tanks,

1018
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:31,711
so make up your mind.

1019
01:02:31,806 --> 01:02:33,695
It'll only take another
few minutes or so.

1020
01:02:33,758 --> 01:02:34,910
And something else-

1021
01:02:35,006 --> 01:02:36,831
the tower just told us
there's a temporary gap,

1022
01:02:36,927 --> 01:02:39,711
so if we taxi out right away,
we could take off fast.

1023
01:02:39,807 --> 01:02:41,950
But five minutes may mean
a half-hour delay,

1024
01:02:42,046 --> 01:02:44,414
so you take the responsibility.
What do we do?

1025
01:02:46,207 --> 01:02:47,710
Cancel that ticket recheck.

1026
01:02:47,806 --> 01:02:49,118
OK. You're leaving now.

1027
01:02:58,814 --> 01:03:00,575
May I see your ticket, please?

1028
01:03:04,767 --> 01:03:05,854
Thank you.

1029
01:03:06,687 --> 01:03:07,614
Ruth!

1030
01:03:08,414 --> 01:03:10,494
Cancel the ticket check.
We're leaving.

1031
01:03:11,326 --> 01:03:12,414
Fine.

1032
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:21,375
C. B.: Commander, start two.

1033
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:25,215
Turning two.

1034
01:03:31,647 --> 01:03:33,055
OKto start one?

1035
01:03:47,327 --> 01:03:51,071
P. A.: Braniff International
flight 252 from Houston...

1036
01:03:51,167 --> 01:03:53,151
now arriving at gate 10,

1037
01:03:53,247 --> 01:03:54,975
the red concourse.

1038
01:03:58,686 --> 01:04:01,471
22, 23, 24, 25,

1039
01:04:01,566 --> 01:04:05,311
26, 27, 28, 29, 30,

1040
01:04:05,406 --> 01:04:08,863
31, 32, 33, 34, 35-

1041
01:04:08,927 --> 01:04:11,583
Excuse me. I'd like
to find out if the-

1042
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:13,663
my husband's on that flight
that left. I-

1043
01:04:13,728 --> 01:04:16,223
I'm sorry. I'm not allowed to
give that information.

1044
01:04:16,287 --> 01:04:17,823
He hasn't been well lately.

1045
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:21,023
I just wanted to make sure
he got on board safely.

1046
01:04:21,087 --> 01:04:22,656
His name is D. O. Guerrero.

1047
01:04:23,487 --> 01:04:24,575
All right.

1048
01:04:26,047 --> 01:04:27,775
Yes. He's aboard.

1049
01:04:29,728 --> 01:04:34,623
19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24,

1050
01:04:34,688 --> 01:04:38,655
25, 26, 27, 28, 29...

1051
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,208
Life rafts are located in the
ceiling storage compartments.

1052
01:05:30,272 --> 01:05:31,808
In addition to the doors,

1053
01:05:31,872 --> 01:05:34,752
there are emergency exits
located over both wings.

1054
01:05:34,816 --> 01:05:37,249
For more information
concerning these items,

1055
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:39,233
please look in the seat pocket
in front of you.

1056
01:05:39,329 --> 01:05:42,400
We suggest you read it sometime
during the flight.

1057
01:06:03,777 --> 01:06:05,408
Don't worry. If you take
one of these,

1058
01:06:05,472 --> 01:06:06,849
you won't get airsick at all.

1059
01:06:06,913 --> 01:06:08,256
Thank you, Doctor.

1060
01:06:13,152 --> 01:06:15,456
Global two, Lincoln Tower.
You're clear for takeoff.

1061
01:06:27,073 --> 01:06:28,800
Global two rolling.

1062
01:06:57,153 --> 01:06:59,328
On top at 7,000.

1063
01:06:59,393 --> 01:07:01,760
Clear above.
Visibility unlimited.

1064
01:07:02,434 --> 01:07:05,793
Proceeding on course.
We'll report passing Cleveland.

1065
01:07:11,713 --> 01:07:14,370
Now, there's nothing
to be nervous about.

1066
01:07:14,433 --> 01:07:16,769
I've flown thousands of miles,
and I can tell you,

1067
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:19,201
it's a lot safer
than crossing a street.

1068
01:07:28,705 --> 01:07:31,169
P. A.:... now in the final stages
of departure...

1069
01:07:31,265 --> 01:07:34,689
at gate 41-A,
the green concourse.

1070
01:07:34,786 --> 01:07:36,769
Yeah, she was here.
I saw her go on.

1071
01:07:36,865 --> 01:07:38,689
But did you see her get off?

1072
01:07:38,785 --> 01:07:41,409
No, but I'm
almost certain she did.

1073
01:07:41,506 --> 01:07:43,970
Her son dropped his wallet.
She went on to return it.

1074
01:07:44,066 --> 01:07:46,657
The wallet gag.
She's on the plane.

1075
01:07:46,721 --> 01:07:48,930
Maybe that's why the head count
didn't tally.

1076
01:07:49,026 --> 01:07:51,617
Speaking of head counts,
have you counted yours lately?

1077
01:07:51,649 --> 01:07:53,250
I'm sure you've got
at least two.

1078
01:07:53,346 --> 01:07:55,810
Should I send word
to the captain to verify?

1079
01:07:55,906 --> 01:07:57,089
Yeah. Have
flight dispatch call...

1080
01:07:57,186 --> 01:07:59,522
on the company frequency
to keep it private.

1081
01:08:05,858 --> 01:08:09,090
Our ground speed
is 620 miles per hour.

1082
01:08:09,186 --> 01:08:12,545
We've reached our cruising
altitude of 33,000 feet,

1083
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:13,890
and the temperature outside...

1084
01:08:13,986 --> 01:08:17,057
is a pleasant
50 degrees below zero.

1085
01:08:17,089 --> 01:08:20,610
Our route tonight will take us
over Toronto, Montreal,

1086
01:08:20,706 --> 01:08:23,010
Cape Ray, St. John,
Newfoundland,

1087
01:08:23,105 --> 01:08:24,290
across the Atlantic,

1088
01:08:24,386 --> 01:08:27,297
reaching the European coastline
just north of Lisbon,

1089
01:08:27,362 --> 01:08:29,090
and on into Rome
on schedule.

1090
01:08:29,186 --> 01:08:31,329
The weather in Rome
is a lot better...

1091
01:08:31,427 --> 01:08:33,506
than what we left behind
in Chicago.

1092
01:08:33,538 --> 01:08:36,290
If there's anything we can do to
make your flight more enjoyable,

1093
01:08:36,386 --> 01:08:38,082
please let us know.
Thank you.

1094
01:08:43,426 --> 01:08:44,802
This is Global two.

1095
01:08:44,898 --> 01:08:47,650
Flight two, Cleveland.
I have a message from Lincoln.

1096
01:08:47,747 --> 01:08:49,282
Advise when ready to copy.

1097
01:08:50,946 --> 01:08:52,866
Go ahead, Cleveland.
We're ready.

1098
01:08:52,898 --> 01:08:55,970
Practically certain
you have a stowaway on board-

1099
01:08:56,066 --> 01:08:59,330
Caucasian... female...

1100
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:01,922
approximately five feet,
100 pounds...

1101
01:09:02,626 --> 01:09:04,611
age about 70...

1102
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:07,650
wearing a brown hat
with a brown pompom,

1103
01:09:07,747 --> 01:09:10,050
tweed coat with black
velvet collar.

1104
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:14,211
Name-Mrs. Ada Quonsett.
Determine and confirm.

1105
01:09:14,306 --> 01:09:15,522
We'll check and advise.

1106
01:09:16,387 --> 01:09:19,010
-I don't believe it.
-Oh, I believe it.

1107
01:09:19,107 --> 01:09:21,506
Those penguins on the ground
are idiots.

1108
01:09:27,426 --> 01:09:31,202
Now the guy in 21D
says it's too hot.

1109
01:09:32,066 --> 01:09:33,442
You want a laugh?

1110
01:09:34,627 --> 01:09:36,002
Have you seen her?

1111
01:09:39,587 --> 01:09:41,091
Well, she's not in first.

1112
01:09:41,186 --> 01:09:43,490
I've hardly checked
the tourist section yet.

1113
01:09:43,587 --> 01:09:46,691
Well, go back and see
if the old biddy's there, huh?

1114
01:09:46,787 --> 01:09:47,971
If so, what do I do?

1115
01:09:48,067 --> 01:09:50,083
Nothing. Just come back
and report.

1116
01:09:51,107 --> 01:09:53,890
How about that, huh?
Little old lady just walks on...

1117
01:09:53,987 --> 01:09:55,523
like she's walking
into an elevator.

1118
01:09:57,507 --> 01:09:58,563
Excuse me.

1119
01:10:00,867 --> 01:10:01,923
There you are.

1120
01:10:07,459 --> 01:10:10,210
WOMiss, the captain said
we'd arrive on schedule.

1121
01:10:10,307 --> 01:10:12,451
That means we'll make up
for the hour's delay.

1122
01:10:12,547 --> 01:10:16,131
Father, with a ground speed
of 620 miles per hour

1123
01:10:16,226 --> 01:10:19,171
and a distance of 4,817 miles,

1124
01:10:19,267 --> 01:10:21,539
it's a physical impossibility.

1125
01:10:21,603 --> 01:10:22,691
Your son is right.

1126
01:10:22,788 --> 01:10:25,411
The captain was referring to
scheduled flying time.

1127
01:10:25,507 --> 01:10:28,579
It will be approximately
71/2 hours from takeoff.

1128
01:10:32,067 --> 01:10:33,283
Oh, excuse me.

1129
01:10:38,787 --> 01:10:41,572
Oh, I see
you've got a boyfriend.

1130
01:10:41,667 --> 01:10:44,163
Yes. He's invited me
to Rome to a nightclub.

1131
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:51,332
Miss! Miss!
These nuts are stale.

1132
01:10:51,428 --> 01:10:53,892
I'm sorry. I'll try
and find you some fresher ones.

1133
01:10:53,987 --> 01:10:56,932
$474, and they
give you stale nuts.

1134
01:10:57,028 --> 01:10:59,331
So you play the oboe.

1135
01:10:59,427 --> 01:11:01,411
My late husband played
the violin.

1136
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,812
Not professionally,
but he was very good.

1137
01:11:03,907 --> 01:11:07,940
He once played the
"FMinute Waltz"F in 58 seconds.

1138
01:11:07,971 --> 01:11:09,924
-There you are.
-Thank you so much.

1139
01:11:27,587 --> 01:11:30,116
-Nuts to the man in 21D.
-You said it.

1140
01:11:32,227 --> 01:11:34,052
May I treat you
to another sherry?

1141
01:11:34,148 --> 01:11:36,452
Oh, no, really.
One is all I ever-

1142
01:11:36,548 --> 01:11:39,076
Well, thank you.
You're very kind.

1143
01:11:44,708 --> 01:11:47,236
She's there, all right. 23B.

1144
01:11:47,908 --> 01:11:49,732
That's why the head count
was wrong.

1145
01:11:49,828 --> 01:11:51,172
What should I do?

1146
01:11:51,267 --> 01:11:53,892
Nothing. If you start
questioning her now,

1147
01:11:53,989 --> 01:11:55,492
there's bound to be tears, and-

1148
01:11:55,588 --> 01:11:57,892
We were asked to check
and report, that's all.

1149
01:11:57,987 --> 01:12:00,292
They'll grab her in Rome,
so until then,

1150
01:12:00,389 --> 01:12:02,531
why make the old girl miserable?

1151
01:12:02,660 --> 01:12:04,996
You know, Captain,
you're a real nice person.

1152
01:12:05,828 --> 01:12:08,133
I didn't know you were
so fond of old women.

1153
01:12:08,228 --> 01:12:11,012
-Oh, I prefer the younger ones.
-So I heard.

1154
01:12:11,108 --> 01:12:13,733
But opportunities, you know,
don't last forever.

1155
01:12:13,828 --> 01:12:15,332
Pretty soon,
we'll have to settle...

1156
01:12:15,428 --> 01:12:16,613
for the not-so-young ones.

1157
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:18,916
Well, I already have
for quite some time.

1158
01:12:19,749 --> 01:12:22,213
That's right. You always played
it straight down the line.

1159
01:12:22,309 --> 01:12:24,132
No mucking around on layovers.

1160
01:12:24,228 --> 01:12:27,332
Ellen was a stewardess
flying DC-4s. That's how we met.

1161
01:12:27,429 --> 01:12:30,053
She knew what was going on,
so when we got married,

1162
01:12:30,148 --> 01:12:32,612
I made her a promise-
the obvious one.

1163
01:12:32,708 --> 01:12:33,797
Always kept it.

1164
01:12:34,788 --> 01:12:37,733
I guess all those kids
you had helped.

1165
01:12:37,829 --> 01:12:39,076
Yeah. Maybe.

1166
01:12:39,909 --> 01:12:42,053
-How many have you got? Six?
-No. Seven.

1167
01:12:42,148 --> 01:12:44,709
Four we planned.
Three we didn't.

1168
01:12:49,349 --> 01:12:52,772
The ones you didn't plan-
did you ever consider...

1169
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,461
doing anything about them
before they were born?

1170
01:12:55,556 --> 01:12:56,837
No.

1171
01:12:58,468 --> 01:13:01,893
Let me tell you something.
I love all seven of them,

1172
01:13:01,989 --> 01:13:04,452
but the three we didn't plan...

1173
01:13:04,549 --> 01:13:07,301
boy, they turned out
to be something real special.

1174
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:17,476
Detain on board...

1175
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:19,717
after landing.

1176
01:13:20,869 --> 01:13:22,116
Release only...

1177
01:13:23,429 --> 01:13:25,317
to station manager Roth.

1178
01:13:28,389 --> 01:13:30,373
I'm going to flight dispatch.
I'll take it.

1179
01:13:30,469 --> 01:13:32,262
I'll take it for you,
Mr. Weatherby.

1180
01:13:32,357 --> 01:13:34,949
No, thank you. It'll wind up
in the ladies room.

1181
01:13:34,981 --> 01:13:36,773
What about the man,
Mr. Weatherby,

1182
01:13:36,869 --> 01:13:38,181
the one with the attaché case?

1183
01:13:38,278 --> 01:13:40,294
If Standish wants to find out
what he's smuggling,

1184
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:42,373
let him get Italian customs
to check.

1185
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:43,813
I won't offend
a paying passenger...

1186
01:13:43,909 --> 01:13:45,509
with something that's
none of our business.

1187
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:48,229
I was wondering, what if
he isn't smuggling? What if-

1188
01:13:48,261 --> 01:13:49,637
Forget it.

1189
01:13:53,509 --> 01:13:56,133
I'm sorry, Mrs. Livingston,
that he got mad at you.

1190
01:13:56,229 --> 01:13:57,541
It was all my fault.

1191
01:13:57,637 --> 01:13:59,717
Never mind.
He'll get over it.

1192
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:03,334
That man was one of the last
to go aboard,

1193
01:14:03,429 --> 01:14:06,118
so he probably was on
that bus that was late.

1194
01:14:11,749 --> 01:14:14,373
-Randall.
-John, this is Tanya Livingston.

1195
01:14:14,469 --> 01:14:17,573
Do me a favor. Read me
the passengers on flight two...

1196
01:14:17,669 --> 01:14:18,853
who came out on the bus.

1197
01:14:18,949 --> 01:14:20,837
Yeah. Hang on.
I've got it right here.

1198
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:26,373
Never mind the women.
Just the men.

1199
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:29,317
OK. "FRathbone, Marcus J."F

1200
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:32,293
"FBinelli, Luigi. "F

1201
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:34,277
"FGuerrero, D. O."F

1202
01:14:35,270 --> 01:14:36,870
"FYates, Robert. "F

1203
01:14:36,902 --> 01:14:38,534
She stood us up, that's all.

1204
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:39,654
I hope that's all.

1205
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:42,277
You or me?

1206
01:14:43,109 --> 01:14:44,037
You.

1207
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:50,023
Bakersfeld.

1208
01:14:50,053 --> 01:14:52,454
Your wife insisted
that I page you.

1209
01:14:52,550 --> 01:14:54,341
She's waiting for you
in your office.

1210
01:14:55,462 --> 01:14:56,678
Thanks.

1211
01:15:04,549 --> 01:15:08,294
P. A.: Delta Air Lines flight 76
for Atlanta...

1212
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:09,734
now departing at gate 12.

1213
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:12,295
Oh, Mrs. Livingston!
I'm sorry to bother you,

1214
01:15:12,390 --> 01:15:13,894
but one of my men
found this woman...

1215
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:15,494
wandering aimlessly
about the terminal.

1216
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:17,286
Seems terribly upset
about something.

1217
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:19,334
-She should see the doctor.
-She doesn't want to.

1218
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:20,614
I think what's worrying
her most...

1219
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:22,982
is she has no money
to get back to town.

1220
01:15:23,911 --> 01:15:25,093
I'd like to help, but-

1221
01:15:25,191 --> 01:15:27,366
She let me go through her purse.
I thought I'd find...

1222
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:29,606
a little address book
or something, call somebody,

1223
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:31,942
but there was nothing
in it but this.

1224
01:15:32,039 --> 01:15:34,406
I thought since her husband
bought a ticket on Global,

1225
01:15:34,471 --> 01:15:36,486
you might want
to give her bus fare.

1226
01:15:36,551 --> 01:15:38,566
$5.00 would do it.

1227
01:15:38,631 --> 01:15:41,478
You just take it easy, ma'am.
Everything will be fine.

1228
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:45,959
Guerrero.

1229
01:15:47,718 --> 01:15:49,383
And we don't have
a home anymore.

1230
01:15:49,445 --> 01:15:52,006
We have a waiting room,
where I walk the floor...

1231
01:15:52,071 --> 01:15:54,086
and wonder whether you
will leave this damn airport...

1232
01:15:54,150 --> 01:15:56,166
long enough to drop by
for a few minutes!

1233
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:59,110
Why you have to pick tonight
to come and fight with me.

1234
01:15:59,206 --> 01:16:01,926
I came here to tell you
that Roberta left home!

1235
01:16:03,591 --> 01:16:06,247
What do you mean, left home?
When?

1236
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:09,286
I called from the banquet,
and I spoke to Libby.

1237
01:16:09,351 --> 01:16:11,526
Roberta, she said, told her
that she couldn't stand...

1238
01:16:11,591 --> 01:16:13,126
our fighting any longer,

1239
01:16:13,191 --> 01:16:16,007
that she couldn't stand
the atmosphere of hate.

1240
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:18,406
And that's a direct quote.

1241
01:16:18,470 --> 01:16:20,487
Where is she? Did Libby say?

1242
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:22,727
She's going to spend the night
at Sally Bolton's house.

1243
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:24,039
I spoke to her.

1244
01:16:25,351 --> 01:16:27,559
Cindy, we can't do this
to the kids.

1245
01:16:28,231 --> 01:16:31,527
We've got to call a truce,
even if it's a pretense.

1246
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:33,767
We've got to start being civil
to each other.

1247
01:16:33,831 --> 01:16:35,847
And add hypocrisy
to the problem?

1248
01:16:35,911 --> 01:16:38,087
They'd see through that.
That's not the answer.

1249
01:16:38,152 --> 01:16:39,943
Well, we've got to do something.

1250
01:16:40,038 --> 01:16:41,159
You're right.

1251
01:16:41,992 --> 01:16:44,326
And the only answer
is a divorce.

1252
01:16:45,191 --> 01:16:47,847
You think that will make them
feel more secure?

1253
01:16:47,911 --> 01:16:49,479
A broken home?

1254
01:16:49,543 --> 01:16:51,207
It's better to come
from a broken home...

1255
01:16:51,271 --> 01:16:52,552
than to live in one.

1256
01:16:54,951 --> 01:16:56,199
You may be right.

1257
01:16:57,351 --> 01:16:59,399
And you may be right
about me, too.

1258
01:17:00,072 --> 01:17:02,727
I'm suppose I'm like a lot
of men-a bigamist,

1259
01:17:02,791 --> 01:17:05,607
married to both a woman
and a job.

1260
01:17:05,672 --> 01:17:09,063
And I can't be number-two wife
any longer.

1261
01:17:13,831 --> 01:17:15,207
Yes, Danny?

1262
01:17:15,272 --> 01:17:17,287
Patroni wants a skip-loader.

1263
01:17:17,352 --> 01:17:20,168
Get one from the lot.
We've got to get that plane out.

1264
01:17:20,232 --> 01:17:23,847
And, Danny, keep 29 clean
so it'll be operational.

1265
01:17:23,911 --> 01:17:26,888
That's what I mean. Those things
are more important than we are.

1266
01:17:26,952 --> 01:17:29,927
No, not more important, but
at the moment, more imperative.

1267
01:17:29,992 --> 01:17:32,071
We're in a hell of a mess.

1268
01:17:32,104 --> 01:17:33,480
We certainly are.

1269
01:17:37,991 --> 01:17:39,847
It's a big step, Cindy.

1270
01:17:39,911 --> 01:17:42,279
Are you sure you don't want
to reconsider?

1271
01:17:42,343 --> 01:17:44,968
No. It's too late, Mel.

1272
01:17:45,031 --> 01:17:47,400
And it's not just the girls
I'm thinking of.

1273
01:17:48,712 --> 01:17:51,560
There's someone else, Mel. There
has been for quite a while.

1274
01:17:52,551 --> 01:17:55,239
Someone who makes me feel wanted
occasionally.

1275
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,207
You had no idea, had you?

1276
01:18:00,904 --> 01:18:03,912
Too busy to even consider
the possibility.

1277
01:18:05,128 --> 01:18:08,968
Mel? Mr. Bakersfeld, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were busy.

1278
01:18:09,031 --> 01:18:11,208
Cindy, uh, Mrs. Livingston.
Mrs. Bakersfeld.

1279
01:18:11,272 --> 01:18:13,288
-How do you do?
-How do you do?

1280
01:18:13,351 --> 01:18:15,688
I have information on that man
with the attaché case.

1281
01:18:15,752 --> 01:18:17,928
I'll talk to you about it
in a little while.

1282
01:18:17,992 --> 01:18:19,080
Certainly.

1283
01:18:24,392 --> 01:18:25,800
Are you sure?

1284
01:18:26,633 --> 01:18:28,808
Are you really sure?

1285
01:18:28,871 --> 01:18:30,121
Yes.

1286
01:18:35,752 --> 01:18:38,728
When we tell the children,
we must do it together.

1287
01:18:38,792 --> 01:18:41,608
Of course, and I promise there
won't be any trouble.

1288
01:18:41,672 --> 01:18:43,528
You may see the girls
as often as you wish.

1289
01:18:43,593 --> 01:18:44,680
Thanks.

1290
01:18:46,312 --> 01:18:49,161
As a matter of fact, you'll
probably see them more often.

1291
01:18:49,992 --> 01:18:53,161
Ex-husbands always seem to make
a special effort.

1292
01:19:01,993 --> 01:19:03,049
Bakersfeld.

1293
01:19:04,232 --> 01:19:05,768
Hang on a sec.

1294
01:19:05,833 --> 01:19:08,808
Ned, I'll be right with you.

1295
01:19:08,873 --> 01:19:11,368
OK, Hank. Go ahead.
Yes. That's all right.

1296
01:19:11,433 --> 01:19:13,928
Put it in warehouse 12.
Well, get the trucks out.

1297
01:19:13,993 --> 01:19:16,328
They're not supposed to
be blocking that area. Right.

1298
01:19:17,513 --> 01:19:18,601
What's up, Ned?

1299
01:19:19,592 --> 01:19:22,600
No, no, no, no.
Let the city police handle it.

1300
01:19:30,953 --> 01:19:33,640
Now, you stay right here.
I'll just be a minute.

1301
01:19:44,937 --> 01:19:46,409
The downtown terminal
said they remembered...

1302
01:19:46,473 --> 01:19:47,688
a man
with an attaché case.

1303
01:19:47,753 --> 01:19:49,738
They must have seen 10 men
with attaché cases.

1304
01:19:49,801 --> 01:19:51,528
But this one held it
under his arm.

1305
01:19:51,593 --> 01:19:53,609
When the agent tried
to put a tag on it,

1306
01:19:53,673 --> 01:19:56,168
he pulled away and insisted on
putting it on himself.

1307
01:19:56,233 --> 01:19:59,433
That's why they remembered him.
And it was Guerrero.

1308
01:19:59,497 --> 01:20:01,609
I can't get anything
out of his wife,

1309
01:20:01,674 --> 01:20:04,009
except a blank stare.

1310
01:20:04,073 --> 01:20:06,089
Maybe you can make her talk.

1311
01:20:06,153 --> 01:20:08,489
Please try. I have
a horrible feeling.

1312
01:20:08,552 --> 01:20:09,737
All right. Bring her in.

1313
01:20:12,392 --> 01:20:13,961
Mrs. Guerrero?

1314
01:20:26,793 --> 01:20:28,041
She's gone.

1315
01:20:33,354 --> 01:20:35,113
Hold it. Yes, sir?

1316
01:20:35,177 --> 01:20:37,129
Remember the woman you
turned over to Mrs. Livingston?

1317
01:20:37,194 --> 01:20:39,689
She's given us the slip. She's
probably still in the terminal.

1318
01:20:39,753 --> 01:20:40,937
You've got to find her, Ned.

1319
01:20:41,001 --> 01:20:42,762
We'll try. Will you
round up our boys?

1320
01:20:42,857 --> 01:20:44,010
We'll announce from here.

1321
01:20:44,073 --> 01:20:45,801
You do it. I'll call
the insurance counter.

1322
01:20:48,394 --> 01:20:50,762
-What's the security code?
-Lester Mean-Wearing.

1323
01:20:53,833 --> 01:20:56,874
Attention, please.
Attention, please.

1324
01:20:56,937 --> 01:20:59,242
For Mr. Lester Mean-Wearing's
party-

1325
01:20:59,338 --> 01:21:00,521
Mr. Mean-Wearing requests...

1326
01:21:00,618 --> 01:21:02,569
that all members
of his travel group...

1327
01:21:02,633 --> 01:21:05,449
report immediately
to the main terminal entrance.

1328
01:21:05,513 --> 01:21:07,562
To the main
terminal entrance.

1329
01:21:09,033 --> 01:21:11,754
Yes. Here it is, Mr. Bakersfeld.

1330
01:21:11,817 --> 01:21:16,234
"FD. O. Guerrero. "F
It's for 225,000.

1331
01:21:17,994 --> 01:21:19,561
Yes, I remember him.

1332
01:21:20,394 --> 01:21:23,177
Yes, sir.
He was a little nervous.

1333
01:21:23,210 --> 01:21:25,930
Aside from that, did you notice
anything unusual about him?

1334
01:21:25,994 --> 01:21:28,650
Well, just one thing.

1335
01:21:28,714 --> 01:21:32,170
For somebody going to Europe, he
didn't seem to have much money.

1336
01:21:32,234 --> 01:21:34,089
He paid me
with six $1.00 bills...

1337
01:21:34,154 --> 01:21:37,130
and the rest in change,
mostly nickels and dimes.

1338
01:21:37,193 --> 01:21:39,530
It seemed to be
just about all he had.

1339
01:21:39,595 --> 01:21:40,682
Thanks.

1340
01:21:58,954 --> 01:22:02,730
You've been so busy, we just
haven't had a chance to chat.

1341
01:22:02,794 --> 01:22:04,651
I'm Ada Quonsett.

1342
01:22:04,714 --> 01:22:06,411
How do you do?

1343
01:22:06,475 --> 01:22:08,202
What's your name, sir?

1344
01:22:09,514 --> 01:22:10,763
Guerrero.

1345
01:22:11,914 --> 01:22:13,803
Guerrero? That's Spanish,
isn't it?

1346
01:22:14,955 --> 01:22:17,290
Yes, but way back.

1347
01:22:17,354 --> 01:22:19,370
You look more Irish.

1348
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:21,003
So did my mother.

1349
01:22:21,994 --> 01:22:23,691
I've been fascinated
by that figuring...

1350
01:22:23,755 --> 01:22:24,970
you've been doing on the map.

1351
01:22:25,034 --> 01:22:27,723
I said to Mr. Davidson
I was sure you would win.

1352
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:30,602
The contest.

1353
01:22:31,435 --> 01:22:33,770
The one that comes the closest
to guessing...

1354
01:22:33,834 --> 01:22:36,523
our time of arrival
wins a sightseeing trip.

1355
01:22:37,515 --> 01:22:41,930
Oh, no. I didn't-no. I just
do this as sort of a hobby.

1356
01:22:41,995 --> 01:22:44,170
I like to see if I can...

1357
01:22:44,235 --> 01:22:46,411
calculate where we are
all the time.

1358
01:22:46,474 --> 01:22:48,010
-Now, that's-
-If you'll excuse me,

1359
01:22:48,075 --> 01:22:50,442
I think I'll take a little nap.

1360
01:22:54,123 --> 01:22:57,931
"FApproach with extreme caution.
His seat assignment is 23A."F

1361
01:22:57,995 --> 01:23:00,650
Have the dispatcher send it
on the company frequency-

1362
01:23:00,715 --> 01:23:03,371
probably New York. They're out
of the Cleveland area by now.

1363
01:23:03,434 --> 01:23:05,610
Maybe the man is just
an ordinary eccentric.

1364
01:23:05,675 --> 01:23:07,851
Maybe all he's got in there
are important papers.

1365
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:09,772
I don't think so. I wish I did.

1366
01:23:09,835 --> 01:23:11,691
I have a niece
aboard that flight.

1367
01:23:11,755 --> 01:23:13,611
All right. Suppose
he has got a bomb.

1368
01:23:13,675 --> 01:23:15,211
They've been up there
over an hour.

1369
01:23:15,307 --> 01:23:17,611
-Why hasn't he let it go?
-I don't know.

1370
01:23:17,674 --> 01:23:20,332
Maybe he's waiting until they
get out over the ocean.

1371
01:23:20,395 --> 01:23:22,315
The Atlantic
doesn't leave traces.

1372
01:23:24,907 --> 01:23:26,252
We just found
the Guerrero woman.

1373
01:23:26,315 --> 01:23:27,979
One of my men is bringing her.

1374
01:23:28,043 --> 01:23:29,932
Hold that call. We may
have something else.

1375
01:23:29,995 --> 01:23:31,243
I'll call you right back.

1376
01:23:32,459 --> 01:23:34,923
Now they say it's too cold.

1377
01:23:44,107 --> 01:23:45,931
Oh, he has fainting spells.

1378
01:23:46,027 --> 01:23:48,972
When he feels one coming on,
he takes a whiff of oxygen.

1379
01:23:49,067 --> 01:23:50,604
Sometimes it helps.

1380
01:23:55,627 --> 01:24:00,011
Don't let him kid you.
It's an F. A. A. regulation.

1381
01:24:00,108 --> 01:24:02,732
Over 25,000, if one of us leaves
the flight deck,

1382
01:24:02,827 --> 01:24:05,612
the other one must go on oxygen.
It's just a precaution.

1383
01:24:05,707 --> 01:24:06,924
Thanks.

1384
01:24:16,747 --> 01:24:19,531
Why didn't you ring?
I could have brought you that.

1385
01:24:19,627 --> 01:24:21,611
Up there, I'd have to be formal.

1386
01:24:21,708 --> 01:24:23,852
Up there, I couldn't
tell you, uh...

1387
01:24:23,948 --> 01:24:26,251
how sorry I am.

1388
01:24:26,348 --> 01:24:29,132
-How do you feel?
-I feel great, Vern.

1389
01:24:29,228 --> 01:24:31,851
No fainting spells.
No craving for pickles.

1390
01:24:31,947 --> 01:24:33,323
No morning sickness.

1391
01:24:35,148 --> 01:24:38,252
It's funny. I didn't think
you were the kind of a guy...

1392
01:24:38,348 --> 01:24:40,299
who would worry
about a thing like this.

1393
01:24:40,364 --> 01:24:42,411
Neither did I.
You know, before,

1394
01:24:42,507 --> 01:24:45,772
you said that you thought
I loved you just a little.

1395
01:24:45,868 --> 01:24:49,644
You're wrong. I-I love you
a lot more than just a little.

1396
01:25:06,828 --> 01:25:08,972
I didn't know
he was going to Rome.

1397
01:25:09,068 --> 01:25:11,051
He said he was going
to Milwaukee.

1398
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:13,325
Here, Inez.
Take another sip of this.

1399
01:25:16,301 --> 01:25:18,828
But this was in your purse.
You must have known.

1400
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:22,412
It just came tonight, special.

1401
01:25:22,509 --> 01:25:24,365
I only saw it after he left.

1402
01:25:25,548 --> 01:25:27,404
Does your husband have business
in Italy?

1403
01:25:29,709 --> 01:25:31,405
What is your husband's business?

1404
01:25:32,109 --> 01:25:34,412
Oh, he's, uh, he was...

1405
01:25:34,508 --> 01:25:37,932
he did excavations
for buildings.

1406
01:25:38,029 --> 01:25:40,812
You've said "Fwas. "F He's not
in that business anymore?

1407
01:25:40,909 --> 01:25:43,052
Things... went wrong.

1408
01:25:43,149 --> 01:25:45,453
-Financial trouble?
-Yes.

1409
01:25:45,549 --> 01:25:46,605
Bad trouble?

1410
01:25:47,948 --> 01:25:49,004
Broke? In debt?

1411
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:51,949
Then how did he pay
for his ticket?

1412
01:25:53,069 --> 01:25:55,372
I think, uh...

1413
01:25:55,468 --> 01:25:56,973
he pawned my mother's
wedding ring.

1414
01:25:57,069 --> 01:26:00,172
When I looked tonight
in the case, it was empty.

1415
01:26:00,268 --> 01:26:04,013
He-he just...

1416
01:26:04,108 --> 01:26:06,253
can't seem to hold a job lately.

1417
01:26:06,349 --> 01:26:07,534
Why not?

1418
01:26:07,629 --> 01:26:10,413
He gets in arguments.
They fire him.

1419
01:26:10,509 --> 01:26:12,173
It's his temper.
He's been like that...

1420
01:26:12,269 --> 01:26:14,284
ever since he got out
of the hospital.

1421
01:26:16,109 --> 01:26:18,093
What sort of hospital?

1422
01:26:18,189 --> 01:26:19,533
Army hospital.

1423
01:26:19,628 --> 01:26:22,445
Yes, but, uh, I mean,
what was he in the hospital for?

1424
01:26:24,589 --> 01:26:27,052
He, uh...

1425
01:26:27,148 --> 01:26:28,365
was sick.

1426
01:26:33,068 --> 01:26:34,124
Mental patient?

1427
01:26:35,213 --> 01:26:37,902
Mrs. Guerrero, what did
your husband do in the army?

1428
01:26:38,989 --> 01:26:41,069
He was a demolition expert.

1429
01:26:43,950 --> 01:26:45,934
And I suppose
in his excavation work,

1430
01:26:46,030 --> 01:26:48,301
he used explosives?

1431
01:26:50,829 --> 01:26:52,812
He, um...

1432
01:26:52,909 --> 01:26:54,445
You were about to say something.

1433
01:26:56,269 --> 01:27:01,453
His last job-they fired him.
Something...

1434
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:04,173
was missing.
Some dynamite.

1435
01:27:06,094 --> 01:27:08,109
What we need is
an unlisted number.

1436
01:27:11,021 --> 01:27:12,206
This is Global two.

1437
01:27:12,301 --> 01:27:15,246
Global two, New York. We have
an important message for you.

1438
01:27:15,342 --> 01:27:16,717
Advise when ready to copy.

1439
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:22,029
OK, New York. Go ahead.

1440
01:27:22,062 --> 01:27:23,630
Strong probability-

1441
01:27:23,661 --> 01:27:25,806
repeat, strong
probability exists...

1442
01:27:25,902 --> 01:27:31,213
that passenger D. O. Guerrero,
seat assignment 23A,

1443
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:34,670
may have an explosive device
in attaché-type briefcase.

1444
01:27:34,701 --> 01:27:37,550
Passenger purchased
excessive insurance,

1445
01:27:37,581 --> 01:27:40,269
mentally disturbed,
and desperate.

1446
01:27:40,302 --> 01:27:42,158
Approach with extreme caution.

1447
01:27:42,222 --> 01:27:46,254
Right. Tell him another section
of 3-by-12s laid crosswise.

1448
01:27:46,350 --> 01:27:48,334
Will do.
They need you?

1449
01:27:48,430 --> 01:27:50,734
No. It won't be ready to drive
for a half-hour.

1450
01:27:50,829 --> 01:27:53,261
Ingram knows what to do
in the meantime. OK.

1451
01:27:53,357 --> 01:27:56,141
So we know the kook
is sitting in 23A. That's here.

1452
01:27:56,173 --> 01:27:58,094
That's right.
What's your opinion?

1453
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:01,262
My opinion is they should get
back here as fast as they can.

1454
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:05,102
If he lets go, could the plane
stand the explosion?

1455
01:28:05,742 --> 01:28:08,270
We got one break-he's not
sitting in an aisle seat,

1456
01:28:08,302 --> 01:28:11,054
so first, it'll blow out
a hunk of the fuselage here.

1457
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:13,358
What kind of structural damage
would that cause?

1458
01:28:13,422 --> 01:28:15,374
There's nothing but skin
on the sides.

1459
01:28:15,471 --> 01:28:17,038
All the control cables run here,

1460
01:28:17,102 --> 01:28:20,398
so if it's not too big a hole,
she might still fly,

1461
01:28:20,462 --> 01:28:23,470
but the sudden decompression
at 30,000 feet...

1462
01:28:23,503 --> 01:28:25,679
is something you got to see
to believe.

1463
01:28:25,742 --> 01:28:29,294
-He'll get sucked out, won't he?
-So will anybody next to him.

1464
01:28:29,390 --> 01:28:30,798
Until that pressure equalizes,

1465
01:28:30,862 --> 01:28:33,711
everything within 20 feet of him
that's not nailed down...

1466
01:28:33,742 --> 01:28:35,502
is going to get sucked out.

1467
01:28:35,598 --> 01:28:37,358
Is it that powerful?
Are you sure?

1468
01:28:37,422 --> 01:28:40,014
Huh. Yeah, I'm sure.

1469
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:43,055
As a mechanic in the Air Force,

1470
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:44,815
I was being transferred
on a MATS plane.

1471
01:28:44,910 --> 01:28:47,790
At 20,000 feet,
one of the windows shattered.

1472
01:28:47,822 --> 01:28:50,574
The guy sitting next to it
was about 170 pounds.

1473
01:28:50,671 --> 01:28:54,255
He went through that space like
hamburger going down a disposal.

1474
01:28:54,351 --> 01:28:58,671
Right after him, coats, pillows,
blankets, cups, saucers...

1475
01:28:58,702 --> 01:28:59,951
yeah, I'm sure.

1476
01:28:59,983 --> 01:29:02,159
Takes about three seconds,
doesn't it?

1477
01:29:02,222 --> 01:29:04,398
Three, four, five.
Depends on the size of the hole.

1478
01:29:04,463 --> 01:29:07,663
Everything fogs up just
like that, and then, watch out.

1479
01:29:07,759 --> 01:29:09,103
That altitude,
you can't breathe,

1480
01:29:09,134 --> 01:29:13,230
so unless they get on oxygen
in 45 seconds, it's good-bye.

1481
01:29:31,503 --> 01:29:34,831
We'll turn back, but I'm
going to make a wide, slow turn.

1482
01:29:34,863 --> 01:29:36,783
That way, the passengers
might not notice.

1483
01:29:38,383 --> 01:29:40,239
Toronto Center,
this is Global two.

1484
01:29:40,304 --> 01:29:42,064
Seem to have a problem here.

1485
01:29:42,159 --> 01:29:44,943
Request clearance back
to Lincoln at a lower altitude.

1486
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:47,855
Roger, Global two.
Turn left, heading 2-7-0.

1487
01:29:47,951 --> 01:29:50,831
Descend and maintain
flight level 2-8-0.

1488
01:29:50,864 --> 01:29:52,431
Are you declaring an emergency?

1489
01:29:52,495 --> 01:29:54,959
Possible emergency. We might
have a disturbed passenger.

1490
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:59,311
There's no mistake.
He's in 23A.

1491
01:29:59,375 --> 01:30:02,576
-Fits the description perfectly.
-When did you see him?

1492
01:30:02,671 --> 01:30:04,111
When I was boarding
Mrs. Quonsett.

1493
01:30:04,175 --> 01:30:05,775
He's sitting right next to her.

1494
01:30:05,871 --> 01:30:07,472
Did you notice
the attaché case?

1495
01:30:07,503 --> 01:30:09,775
It's on his lap,
and he won't put it down.

1496
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:12,175
Ruth told me that when
she was serving the snacks,

1497
01:30:12,271 --> 01:30:14,192
he wouldn't use
the pull-down table.

1498
01:30:14,255 --> 01:30:17,135
He insisted on putting his tray
on top of his case.

1499
01:30:17,231 --> 01:30:19,056
Sounds as if that's
where he's got it.

1500
01:30:19,152 --> 01:30:22,223
Then he must have a trigger
on the outside of the case.

1501
01:30:22,320 --> 01:30:24,559
Is anyone sitting on the other
side of the old lady?

1502
01:30:24,623 --> 01:30:25,552
A man.

1503
01:30:26,991 --> 01:30:30,159
Then I'd have to lean over two
people. I couldn't surprise him.

1504
01:30:31,503 --> 01:30:33,200
OK if I go take a look?

1505
01:30:33,263 --> 01:30:36,592
Sure. Not too close a look.
He might suspect something.

1506
01:30:36,623 --> 01:30:37,711
No.

1507
01:30:39,344 --> 01:30:43,312
I'll do one of those smiling,
good evening walk-throughs.

1508
01:30:43,375 --> 01:30:46,000
If anybody catches the fact
that we're turning around,

1509
01:30:46,064 --> 01:30:47,376
I'll give some double-talk.

1510
01:30:49,552 --> 01:30:51,344
Toronto Center,
Global two starting to turn.

1511
01:30:51,375 --> 01:30:53,424
Would like to make it
wide and gradual.

1512
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,600
Global two, wide turn approved.

1513
01:30:55,663 --> 01:30:58,000
Will alert other sectors
to your problem.

1514
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,567
So delay serving dinner.

1515
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:13,936
Put every bottle, cup, glass,
and everything else away...

1516
01:31:14,032 --> 01:31:15,055
and lock it up.

1517
01:31:15,151 --> 01:31:16,624
Right. Be careful, Vernon.

1518
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:18,416
All right. I'll tell the girls
in tourist.

1519
01:31:28,113 --> 01:31:31,504
Oh. Oh, Captain. Our son
has a question to ask you.

1520
01:31:31,601 --> 01:31:33,584
Schuyler, here's our captain.

1521
01:31:33,681 --> 01:31:36,432
Before, Virgo and Leo
were right there, sir.

1522
01:31:36,465 --> 01:31:39,792
Now I'm beginning to see
Ursa Minor and Cassiopeia.

1523
01:31:39,824 --> 01:31:41,968
We must be turning around.

1524
01:31:42,032 --> 01:31:44,784
You have
a young navigator here.

1525
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:48,144
I'll tell you, son,
due to a setzle wind,

1526
01:31:48,208 --> 01:31:51,984
distors vexered us into
a 360 tarsan of slower traffic.

1527
01:31:52,081 --> 01:31:54,225
We'll maintain
this borton hold...

1528
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:57,040
until we get fortomagnus
clearance from Malnix.

1529
01:31:57,904 --> 01:31:59,984
Oh. Yes, of course.

1530
01:32:04,049 --> 01:32:06,609
What did he mean by that, son?

1531
01:32:06,672 --> 01:32:08,593
Never mind, Father.
I'll tell you later.

1532
01:32:10,832 --> 01:32:11,921
Enjoying your trip?

1533
01:32:11,984 --> 01:32:14,128
Very much. I was telling
my wife how smooth it is.

1534
01:32:14,192 --> 01:32:16,369
A little while ago,
I put my drink on the armrest,

1535
01:32:16,433 --> 01:32:17,745
and there wasn't even a ripple.

1536
01:32:17,808 --> 01:32:18,864
Didn't lose a drop.

1537
01:32:23,824 --> 01:32:26,160
-Hi, girls.
-Slumming, Captain?

1538
01:32:26,225 --> 01:32:28,081
-No. We got some
bumpy weather ahead,

1539
01:32:28,145 --> 01:32:29,809
so don't serve dinner yet.

1540
01:32:29,873 --> 01:32:31,345
Keep everything in the drawers.

1541
01:32:31,441 --> 01:32:32,369
OK.

1542
01:32:33,264 --> 01:32:35,281
Doug, are you getting
plane-to-ground direct?

1543
01:32:35,344 --> 01:32:36,400
Affirmative.

1544
01:32:36,465 --> 01:32:38,961
They've turned around
and started a slow descent.

1545
01:32:39,024 --> 01:32:40,561
What's the frequency?

1546
01:32:40,625 --> 01:32:42,384
132.0.

1547
01:32:46,481 --> 01:32:48,432
I'm sorry to have to
put this on you,

1548
01:32:48,529 --> 01:32:51,953
but if I go back there a second
time, he might get suspicious.

1549
01:32:52,049 --> 01:32:54,481
Don't worry.
I think I can handle it.

1550
01:33:08,273 --> 01:33:11,313
Excuse me, madam.
May I see your ticket?

1551
01:33:11,345 --> 01:33:12,913
My ticket?

1552
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:14,929
That nice young man at the gate
took it.

1553
01:33:14,993 --> 01:33:16,242
He wouldn't do that.

1554
01:33:17,233 --> 01:33:18,609
If it was a round-trip ticket,

1555
01:33:18,674 --> 01:33:20,434
you still have
the return flight coupon.

1556
01:33:20,465 --> 01:33:24,145
If it was one-way, you have the
ticket stub and boarding folder.

1557
01:33:24,242 --> 01:33:25,809
You're English, aren't you?

1558
01:33:25,873 --> 01:33:28,913
I knew it the moment
you started to talk.

1559
01:33:29,009 --> 01:33:31,570
You make our language sound
so delightful.

1560
01:33:31,633 --> 01:33:33,426
-My late husband said-
-Never mind what he said.

1561
01:33:33,522 --> 01:33:34,865
What about your ticket?

1562
01:33:34,961 --> 01:33:37,041
I'll look, dear, but I'm sure-

1563
01:33:37,106 --> 01:33:39,953
Why don't you stop
wasting my time, Mrs. Quonsett?

1564
01:33:40,050 --> 01:33:42,706
You are Mrs. Ada Quonsett,
aren't you?

1565
01:33:42,770 --> 01:33:44,754
Since you're aware
of who I am,

1566
01:33:44,850 --> 01:33:46,225
there's no use denying it,
is there?

1567
01:33:46,321 --> 01:33:48,305
If there's some
misunderstanding, I can help.

1568
01:33:48,402 --> 01:33:50,929
There's no misunderstanding.
Are you traveling with her?

1569
01:33:50,993 --> 01:33:52,049
No.

1570
01:33:52,114 --> 01:33:53,586
Then it's not your business.

1571
01:33:53,682 --> 01:33:55,889
This woman is a stowaway.

1572
01:33:55,953 --> 01:33:57,745
Are we going to turn back?

1573
01:33:57,842 --> 01:33:59,313
You're not that important.

1574
01:33:59,410 --> 01:34:02,066
When we land in Rome, you'll be
handed over to the authorities.

1575
01:34:02,130 --> 01:34:05,073
Come with me. The captain
has to make a report on you,

1576
01:34:05,106 --> 01:34:08,305
but first he'd like to see you.
Let this lady out, please.

1577
01:34:08,402 --> 01:34:11,666
-The captain wants to see me?
-He doesn't like to wait.

1578
01:34:11,730 --> 01:34:13,426
Don't treat her
like a criminal.

1579
01:34:13,490 --> 01:34:14,866
That's what she is.

1580
01:34:16,114 --> 01:34:17,905
Shoving an old lady
like that!

1581
01:34:17,970 --> 01:34:19,442
I've never seen the like.

1582
01:34:34,866 --> 01:34:35,954
Mrs. Quonsett,

1583
01:34:35,986 --> 01:34:38,130
I'm Captain Demerest.
This is Captain Harris.

1584
01:34:38,194 --> 01:34:40,306
Would you come forward
as far as you can?

1585
01:34:43,346 --> 01:34:44,786
Oh, Captain-

1586
01:34:44,883 --> 01:34:47,091
Please sit down, Mrs. Quonsett.

1587
01:34:47,154 --> 01:34:48,851
I'm sorry to be
a trouble to you,

1588
01:34:48,914 --> 01:34:52,050
but I was going to New York
to visit my poor daughter-

1589
01:34:52,113 --> 01:34:54,067
Why'd you
get on this flight?

1590
01:34:54,163 --> 01:34:56,210
Because according to the schedule,

1591
01:34:56,275 --> 01:34:59,283
the next flight back from Rome
is to New York-your number 5-

1592
01:34:59,346 --> 01:35:01,587
and I thought they'd want
to get rid of me quickly,

1593
01:35:01,682 --> 01:35:03,250
so they'd put me on that plane.

1594
01:35:03,315 --> 01:35:05,714
If you help us,
I promise you,

1595
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:08,850
you'll get to take trips
to New York, first class.

1596
01:35:08,915 --> 01:35:12,242
Oh. Thank you.
But how can I help?

1597
01:35:12,306 --> 01:35:15,154
Mrs. Quonsett, now,
whatever happened back there,

1598
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:17,554
you can forget. That's not why
you were brought here.

1599
01:35:18,386 --> 01:35:20,434
Mrs. Quonsett,
I hope I didn't hurt you.

1600
01:35:20,531 --> 01:35:23,794
No, no... not much.

1601
01:35:23,827 --> 01:35:26,099
Are you frightened easily?

1602
01:35:26,163 --> 01:35:27,315
No.

1603
01:35:27,379 --> 01:35:30,770
I get nervous sometimes,
but not as much as I used to.

1604
01:35:30,835 --> 01:35:33,683
When you get older, there isn't
a lot left to be frightened of.

1605
01:35:33,778 --> 01:35:38,291
Good. All right, now...
you listen very carefully.

1606
01:35:38,354 --> 01:35:40,274
C. B.: Global two,
this is Toronto Center.

1607
01:35:40,371 --> 01:35:43,475
Your position is 15 miles east
of Klineberg intersection.

1608
01:35:43,539 --> 01:35:44,691
Say altitude.

1609
01:35:44,755 --> 01:35:48,050
Level at 2-8-0.
Request continued slow descent.

1610
01:35:48,115 --> 01:35:50,451
Roger, Global two.
What altitude do you wish?

1611
01:35:50,515 --> 01:35:54,035
-Request flight level 2-1-0.
-Roger. Continue slow descent.

1612
01:35:54,099 --> 01:35:56,979
Maintain flight level 2-1-0.

1613
01:35:57,043 --> 01:35:59,443
Mel, I just talked
to the other commissioners,

1614
01:35:59,539 --> 01:36:01,331
and they all agree with me.

1615
01:36:01,394 --> 01:36:03,955
So as not to have more trouble
with Meadowood residents,

1616
01:36:04,019 --> 01:36:08,083
I'm instructing you to shut
the airport down until 7 a. m.

1617
01:36:12,019 --> 01:36:13,875
Read this...

1618
01:36:13,939 --> 01:36:15,475
dispatch we just sent.

1619
01:36:15,571 --> 01:36:18,579
The plane's on its way back.
You still want us to shut down?

1620
01:36:19,859 --> 01:36:22,291
Under the circumstances,
I, uh, I...

1621
01:36:26,419 --> 01:36:28,371
Global two,
this is Toronto Center.

1622
01:36:28,435 --> 01:36:29,715
Continue slow descent.

1623
01:36:32,692 --> 01:36:34,739
Whatever she's done,
you don't have to be so rough.

1624
01:36:34,803 --> 01:36:35,892
Don't interfere.

1625
01:36:41,298 --> 01:36:42,835
Ask the captain to reconsider.

1626
01:36:42,931 --> 01:36:45,684
I don't want to be handed over
to the Italian police!

1627
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:47,795
It's too late. Get in your seat.

1628
01:36:47,892 --> 01:36:49,684
All I ask is to be sent back.

1629
01:36:49,779 --> 01:36:52,339
Please, don't hand me over
in a foreign country.

1630
01:36:52,404 --> 01:36:55,475
-Can't you see she's upset?
-I told you to keep out of this.

1631
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:57,012
Sit down and be quiet.

1632
01:36:57,075 --> 01:36:59,091
You hurt me! You hurt me.

1633
01:36:59,156 --> 01:37:00,819
Stop it!
You're hysterical.

1634
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:05,076
Oh, help me! Please, help me.
Help me!

1635
01:37:05,140 --> 01:37:07,123
No! No.

1636
01:37:08,084 --> 01:37:10,740
That's his personal
property. You can't take it!

1637
01:37:14,195 --> 01:37:17,204
No! No!
You stay where you are!

1638
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:19,220
Don't try to get any closer.

1639
01:37:21,619 --> 01:37:24,819
Guerrero,
listen to me. Do you hear me?

1640
01:37:24,884 --> 01:37:26,675
Listen.

1641
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:29,140
They know about you
on the ground.

1642
01:37:29,172 --> 01:37:30,804
Your insurance is no good.

1643
01:37:31,891 --> 01:37:33,940
It's canceled. It's worthless.

1644
01:37:34,003 --> 01:37:36,276
No one has ever gotten away
with a thing like this.

1645
01:37:36,340 --> 01:37:38,195
No one has collected a penny.

1646
01:37:40,276 --> 01:37:42,900
You won't help your family.
You'll only hurt them.

1647
01:37:42,964 --> 01:37:46,292
You'll kill yourself for nothing
if you explode that bomb.

1648
01:37:46,356 --> 01:37:47,604
Stay where you are!

1649
01:37:49,012 --> 01:37:51,732
Your family will be
hounded and blamed.

1650
01:37:51,796 --> 01:37:52,981
Listen to me. Think.

1651
01:37:54,676 --> 01:37:57,941
Guerrero, let these people
sit down, and we'll talk.

1652
01:38:00,852 --> 01:38:04,019
I promise, until you're ready,
no one will come close.

1653
01:38:07,572 --> 01:38:08,885
Sit down, please.

1654
01:38:12,756 --> 01:38:15,380
Guerrero, you know now
that you've failed.

1655
01:38:19,797 --> 01:38:23,892
The only way you can help your
family is to give me that case.

1656
01:38:25,716 --> 01:38:27,060
Give me the case.

1657
01:38:29,812 --> 01:38:33,141
If you do, I promise, no one
on this plane will hurt you.

1658
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:42,932
Grab him! He's got a bomb!

1659
01:39:29,653 --> 01:39:31,061
Get on oxygen!

1660
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:36,533
Mayday! Mayday!

1661
01:40:08,821 --> 01:40:13,045
Trans Global two. Decompression.
Making emergency descent.

1662
01:40:20,022 --> 01:40:22,134
Request 10,000.

1663
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:24,566
Roger. Descend
and maintain 10,000.

1664
01:40:24,661 --> 01:40:26,549
Report your intentions
when ready.

1665
01:41:12,502 --> 01:41:14,006
Global two, Toronto Center.

1666
01:41:14,102 --> 01:41:17,814
We're level at 10,000.
Returning to heading 2-7-0.

1667
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:21,367
We have damage due to explosion.
Extent unknown.

1668
01:41:23,287 --> 01:41:24,886
Turn on all the heat you've got.

1669
01:41:26,966 --> 01:41:28,374
Can we maintain control?

1670
01:41:28,502 --> 01:41:29,591
The rudder's heavy,

1671
01:41:29,654 --> 01:41:31,767
and the stabilizer trim
won't respond,

1672
01:41:31,862 --> 01:41:34,070
but at least
the tail didn't fall off.

1673
01:41:34,102 --> 01:41:36,374
-Where'd he pull the trigger?
-In the starboard can.

1674
01:41:36,470 --> 01:41:39,510
Go back and check the damage
and report by interphone.

1675
01:41:39,543 --> 01:41:41,814
According to the manifest,
there's three doctors aboard.

1676
01:41:41,911 --> 01:41:43,126
Let's hope
they're not dentists.

1677
01:41:43,222 --> 01:41:44,534
They're probably
pitching in already.

1678
01:41:44,630 --> 01:41:46,006
Get anybody else
that can help.

1679
01:41:46,871 --> 01:41:48,727
And find out about Gwen.

1680
01:41:53,143 --> 01:41:56,023
WOI'm so cold.
I'm terribly cold.

1681
01:41:57,431 --> 01:41:59,830
Put him on the walk-around.
I'm cutting off the oxygen.

1682
01:41:59,863 --> 01:42:00,823
All right.

1683
01:42:08,695 --> 01:42:10,615
You can breathe normally.
You can take off the masks.

1684
01:42:10,710 --> 01:42:12,150
Fasten your seat belts.

1685
01:42:12,951 --> 01:42:14,007
Fasten your seat belts.

1686
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:20,950
Fasten your seat belts.

1687
01:42:24,534 --> 01:42:26,903
Stewardess, if there's any
brandy on board, pass it out.

1688
01:42:27,927 --> 01:42:30,550
Are you a doctor?
Yes, sister.

1689
01:42:30,615 --> 01:42:31,831
Press that hard.

1690
01:42:33,943 --> 01:42:35,223
Are you all right?

1691
01:42:36,055 --> 01:42:37,974
-May I help you?
-I'm all right, thank you.

1692
01:42:38,071 --> 01:42:39,671
Take care of that man behind me.

1693
01:42:47,383 --> 01:42:49,687
-How is her pulse, sister?
-Weak.

1694
01:42:50,551 --> 01:42:53,976
I have some adrenaline syringes.
Would you prepare a shot?

1695
01:42:56,695 --> 01:42:57,783
Will it hold?

1696
01:42:57,847 --> 01:43:00,247
SECOND After I get
this blanket wedged in here.

1697
01:43:14,551 --> 01:43:15,447
Joan.

1698
01:43:16,983 --> 01:43:19,096
As soon as they're patched up,
move them forward.

1699
01:43:19,192 --> 01:43:21,976
Stow the center armrests.
Put four people in three seats.

1700
01:43:22,071 --> 01:43:23,032
Right.

1701
01:43:28,984 --> 01:43:30,392
Go ahead.

1702
01:43:30,423 --> 01:43:32,824
The hole's about
three to four feet.

1703
01:43:32,855 --> 01:43:35,384
What about control surfaces?
Can you see anything?

1704
01:43:35,480 --> 01:43:37,112
Possible damage to rudder power,

1705
01:43:37,176 --> 01:43:39,544
and it looks like
we have stabilizer problems.

1706
01:43:39,576 --> 01:43:41,720
Most of the glass, thank God,
went sideways.

1707
01:43:41,783 --> 01:43:43,864
Can we stay in the air an hour?

1708
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:46,744
Hard to tell. There's a tear
in the ceiling from the hole...

1709
01:43:46,839 --> 01:43:48,696
over to the port side.

1710
01:43:48,792 --> 01:43:50,712
Think there's a rupture
in the outer skin?

1711
01:43:50,776 --> 01:43:52,599
I don't know. Could be.

1712
01:43:52,664 --> 01:43:54,040
What about the passengers?

1713
01:43:55,704 --> 01:43:57,143
I can't say anything definite.

1714
01:43:57,176 --> 01:43:58,904
I checked
the structural damage first,

1715
01:43:58,936 --> 01:44:01,336
but what I did see
was less than I expected-

1716
01:44:01,432 --> 01:44:04,152
some cuts and bruises
and shock and puking.

1717
01:44:04,183 --> 01:44:05,496
Medical help good.

1718
01:44:05,591 --> 01:44:07,576
I'm going to cut off
the passenger oxygen.

1719
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:10,231
How's Gwen?

1720
01:44:11,481 --> 01:44:15,000
Pretty bad shape.
The doctor's working on her.

1721
01:44:15,064 --> 01:44:16,697
I'll report when I can.

1722
01:44:16,793 --> 01:44:18,905
Sounds like the break
is this side of the tail.

1723
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,432
Better sit down
as fast as we can, if we can.

1724
01:44:21,496 --> 01:44:22,424
Right.

1725
01:44:24,983 --> 01:44:26,616
Toronto Center, Global two.

1726
01:44:26,712 --> 01:44:28,312
Have structural damage.

1727
01:44:28,376 --> 01:44:31,351
Would like to land
nearest available airport.

1728
01:44:31,384 --> 01:44:33,017
Global two, Toronto Center.

1729
01:44:33,112 --> 01:44:34,936
Everything east of Lincoln
on your course...

1730
01:44:35,033 --> 01:44:37,976
is closed due to weather
or field conditions.

1731
01:44:38,071 --> 01:44:41,560
However, if you are declaring
an emergency, Detroit possible.

1732
01:44:42,744 --> 01:44:45,176
They report five inches
of snow over ice,

1733
01:44:45,272 --> 01:44:46,745
but they will try to clear.

1734
01:44:48,825 --> 01:44:51,992
Request detour. Stand by in
case of any change in condition.

1735
01:44:52,024 --> 01:44:53,561
We'll try for Lincoln.

1736
01:44:53,624 --> 01:44:54,937
Roger, Global two.

1737
01:44:55,032 --> 01:45:00,152
You are leaving my area.
Contact Cleveland Center, 117.5.

1738
01:45:00,185 --> 01:45:01,241
Good luck.

1739
01:45:02,393 --> 01:45:03,544
Roger, Toronto.

1740
01:45:06,585 --> 01:45:10,360
Cleveland Center,
Global two on your frequency.

1741
01:45:10,425 --> 01:45:13,816
Global two, this is
Cleveland Center. Radar contact.

1742
01:45:13,912 --> 01:45:17,336
Turn right, heading 2-8-0.
Maintain 10,000.

1743
01:45:17,432 --> 01:45:21,465
Lincoln weather: sky obscured,
visibility 1 mile, blowing snow.

1744
01:45:21,561 --> 01:45:23,993
Runway two-niner still closed.

1745
01:45:24,024 --> 01:45:28,025
But we have control damage which
makes landing on 29 imperative.

1746
01:45:28,121 --> 01:45:30,776
-Repeat: imperative!
-Roger, Global two.

1747
01:45:30,872 --> 01:45:33,145
We'll relay your condition
and request.

1748
01:45:33,176 --> 01:45:34,936
Keep monitoring.
I'll be in Mobile One.

1749
01:45:35,032 --> 01:45:36,057
If there's any change, call me.

1750
01:45:36,153 --> 01:45:39,001
Global two,
this is Cleveland Center.

1751
01:45:39,065 --> 01:45:41,817
All eyeglasses off.
Eyeglasses off.

1752
01:45:41,913 --> 01:45:43,705
All eyeglasses off.

1753
01:45:43,737 --> 01:45:45,433
Take off your eyeglasses

1754
01:45:45,466 --> 01:45:48,281
and return your seats
to their upright position.

1755
01:45:48,346 --> 01:45:50,265
Take off your eyeglasses

1756
01:45:50,361 --> 01:45:52,921
and return your seats
to their upright position.

1757
01:46:16,344 --> 01:46:19,225
The captain deliberately
struck me across the face!

1758
01:46:19,322 --> 01:46:22,938
Unless you shut up, the second
officer's going to do the same.

1759
01:46:23,033 --> 01:46:24,921
Is there anything
I can do to help?

1760
01:46:26,265 --> 01:46:29,561
Yes, Father. I'm putting you
in charge of praying.

1761
01:46:29,626 --> 01:46:32,154
If that's an order,
you're 30 minutes too late, son.

1762
01:46:34,713 --> 01:46:36,793
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Captain Demerest.

1763
01:46:36,825 --> 01:46:39,962
I want to thank you for moving
forward in an orderly manner.

1764
01:46:40,025 --> 01:46:41,881
I think it'll be
warmer for you this way,

1765
01:46:41,946 --> 01:46:45,113
and it'll help us in controlling
the plane during landing.

1766
01:46:45,145 --> 01:46:47,801
You know we've all had trouble,
bad trouble.

1767
01:46:47,866 --> 01:46:50,265
I won't attempt to minimize it,

1768
01:46:50,361 --> 01:46:52,506
but we've all gone through
an experience...

1769
01:46:52,537 --> 01:46:54,297
that none of us
has ever had before,

1770
01:46:54,393 --> 01:46:57,466
and thank God
we have come through.

1771
01:46:57,562 --> 01:46:59,258
We have the airplane
under control.

1772
01:46:59,354 --> 01:47:02,234
We estimate landing
in about 25 minutes.

1773
01:47:02,266 --> 01:47:05,913
I won't kid you-we still have
a few problems ahead of us.

1774
01:47:05,946 --> 01:47:08,762
Now, there are two thoughts
that should comfort you.

1775
01:47:08,826 --> 01:47:11,418
First, you're in one of
the best-constructed planes...

1776
01:47:11,514 --> 01:47:12,954
that there is.

1777
01:47:12,985 --> 01:47:16,793
Second... tonight, instead of
one experienced captain,

1778
01:47:16,825 --> 01:47:19,738
you have two-
Captain Harris and myself.

1779
01:47:19,834 --> 01:47:23,002
Between us, we have more
flying years than we...

1780
01:47:23,066 --> 01:47:25,050
I'm giving you
something for the pain,

1781
01:47:25,114 --> 01:47:27,227
but don't move your head.

1782
01:47:27,323 --> 01:47:28,890
Later on,
Second Officer Jordon...

1783
01:47:28,954 --> 01:47:30,906
will give you instructions
on landing procedure.

1784
01:47:31,002 --> 01:47:34,074
Please do exactly as he says,
and I promise you,

1785
01:47:34,105 --> 01:47:36,570
we'll all come through this
together safely.

1786
01:47:36,633 --> 01:47:37,562
Thank you.

1787
01:47:52,154 --> 01:47:53,594
Global two, Cleveland Center.

1788
01:47:53,690 --> 01:47:56,602
Lincoln advises runway two-niner
still closed.

1789
01:47:56,666 --> 01:47:59,034
They are attempting to clear,
but failing that,

1790
01:47:59,131 --> 01:48:00,762
plan landing on 22.

1791
01:48:02,267 --> 01:48:03,195
Roger.

1792
01:48:06,491 --> 01:48:08,826
-Want me to take over a while?
-Yeah, thanks.

1793
01:48:19,867 --> 01:48:21,755
Ground, Mobile One.

1794
01:48:21,786 --> 01:48:23,707
Yes, Mel?

1795
01:48:23,771 --> 01:48:26,843
Tell the chief to take position
between runway 29 and 22...

1796
01:48:26,906 --> 01:48:28,411
so they can move either way.

1797
01:48:28,474 --> 01:48:30,042
We'll notify which runway later.

1798
01:48:30,107 --> 01:48:31,162
Roger.

1799
01:48:37,275 --> 01:48:39,771
Turn left, heading 2-0-5.

1800
01:48:39,835 --> 01:48:42,395
At pilot's discretion,
descend and maintain 6,000.

1801
01:48:42,491 --> 01:48:44,442
Report leaving 10,000.

1802
01:48:45,146 --> 01:48:47,131
Global two turning left,
heading 2-0-5,

1803
01:48:47,195 --> 01:48:49,083
leaving 10,000 now.

1804
01:48:53,627 --> 01:48:56,251
Mr. Jordan said you wanted
to see me again, Captain.

1805
01:48:56,315 --> 01:48:57,755
We radioed ahead,

1806
01:48:57,850 --> 01:48:59,643
and they'll have all the
equipment that you asked for.

1807
01:48:59,706 --> 01:49:02,107
Oh, good.
You'd better call again.

1808
01:49:02,203 --> 01:49:05,306
Ask the airport doctor to have
an ophthalmic surgeon stand by.

1809
01:49:06,747 --> 01:49:08,987
-For Miss Meighen?
-Yes.

1810
01:49:09,084 --> 01:49:10,970
Besides the other injuries
I mentioned,

1811
01:49:11,035 --> 01:49:13,211
I'm afraid her right eye
has splinters.

1812
01:49:13,276 --> 01:49:15,771
Whether they're wood or metal,
I have no way of knowing.

1813
01:49:15,834 --> 01:49:18,588
Her left eye, as far
as I can tell, is unharmed.

1814
01:49:18,651 --> 01:49:21,530
Of course, it's too early
to draw conclusions.

1815
01:49:21,595 --> 01:49:24,252
Modern ophthalmic surgery
can do extraordinary things.

1816
01:49:24,314 --> 01:49:25,692
I'd better get back to her-

1817
01:49:25,755 --> 01:49:27,451
Doctor?

1818
01:49:27,515 --> 01:49:31,995
Gwen-Miss Meighen-
she's pregnant.

1819
01:49:32,090 --> 01:49:33,531
Does that make a difference?

1820
01:49:33,595 --> 01:49:34,523
I had no way of knowing.

1821
01:49:34,587 --> 01:49:36,731
Her pregnancy can't be
very far advanced.

1822
01:49:36,795 --> 01:49:38,011
No, it isn't.

1823
01:49:38,076 --> 01:49:41,212
She wasn't deprived of oxygen
long enough to harm the child.

1824
01:49:41,275 --> 01:49:42,588
No one was.

1825
01:49:43,835 --> 01:49:46,651
If there are no abdominal
injuries and she survives,

1826
01:49:46,715 --> 01:49:50,044
chances are good that the baby
should be born normally.

1827
01:49:55,356 --> 01:49:56,571
Global two leaving 8,000.

1828
01:49:56,636 --> 01:49:59,131
Advise Lincoln doctor to have
ophthalmic surgeon available.

1829
01:49:59,196 --> 01:50:02,012
Roger, Global two.
Will notify.

1830
01:50:02,076 --> 01:50:03,323
I'll take over now.

1831
01:50:06,075 --> 01:50:10,012
Vern, I guess you know
how badly I feel about Gwen.

1832
01:50:10,076 --> 01:50:12,892
What's between you two,
that's none of my business,

1833
01:50:12,956 --> 01:50:14,748
but if there's anything
I can do as a friend...

1834
01:50:16,956 --> 01:50:18,365
You already have.

1835
01:50:25,115 --> 01:50:26,555
Mobile One, ground control.

1836
01:50:26,588 --> 01:50:28,252
Yes, Doug. This is Mel.

1837
01:50:28,316 --> 01:50:31,292
Cleveland just handed off
flight two to Chicago Center.

1838
01:50:31,356 --> 01:50:34,012
The aircraft transmissions
aren't exactly regulation.

1839
01:50:34,076 --> 01:50:35,547
The captain's blowing a fuse.

1840
01:50:35,645 --> 01:50:38,331
I'd like to monitor.
What's the frequency?

1841
01:50:38,396 --> 01:50:40,124
117.1.

1842
01:50:44,955 --> 01:50:46,492
We need answers,
not questions.

1843
01:50:46,557 --> 01:50:48,252
Are you guys
sleeping down there?

1844
01:50:48,316 --> 01:50:49,693
Why aren't we getting
any action?

1845
01:50:49,756 --> 01:50:51,292
We need help!

1846
01:50:51,356 --> 01:50:54,333
Global two, this is the Chicago
Center watch supervisor.

1847
01:50:54,396 --> 01:50:56,509
Please understand
we're doing everything we can.

1848
01:50:56,604 --> 01:50:59,068
We're holding other traffic
and giving you priority.

1849
01:50:59,164 --> 01:51:00,572
What type of approach
do you wish?

1850
01:51:00,636 --> 01:51:02,972
Chicago supervisor,
listen carefully.

1851
01:51:03,036 --> 01:51:06,172
Any approach is no damned good
if it ends on runway 22.

1852
01:51:06,236 --> 01:51:07,612
We need two-niner.

1853
01:51:07,677 --> 01:51:10,333
We've got an unserviceable
stabilizer trim,

1854
01:51:10,396 --> 01:51:13,212
doubtful rudder control,
and structural damage.

1855
01:51:13,276 --> 01:51:14,812
If we're brought in on 22,

1856
01:51:14,877 --> 01:51:17,692
there'll be a broken airplane
and a lot of dead people,

1857
01:51:17,757 --> 01:51:19,932
so you call Lincoln
and turn the screws.

1858
01:51:19,996 --> 01:51:22,973
You tell the Lincoln manager
to get off his butt...

1859
01:51:23,037 --> 01:51:24,445
and clear that runway!

1860
01:51:30,077 --> 01:51:32,573
Snow desk, Mobile One.

1861
01:51:32,636 --> 01:51:34,653
This is snow desk.
Go ahead, Mel.

1862
01:51:34,717 --> 01:51:38,332
Danny, listen carefully.
Break the conga line.

1863
01:51:38,397 --> 01:51:41,213
Send the heavy plows
across to runway two-niner.

1864
01:51:41,277 --> 01:51:43,580
They're to head for stuck
airplane and await instruction.

1865
01:51:43,645 --> 01:51:45,021
Roger.

1866
01:51:47,516 --> 01:51:49,181
Conga leader, snow desk.

1867
01:52:12,381 --> 01:52:13,437
Yeah, that's it.

1868
01:52:13,533 --> 01:52:16,093
On this side,
get close under the wheel.

1869
01:52:16,156 --> 01:52:18,045
Whack it on the other side.

1870
01:52:35,838 --> 01:52:38,333
Keep monitoring Chicago Central
and ground control.

1871
01:52:38,397 --> 01:52:40,253
If you hear anything
important, honk.

1872
01:52:40,317 --> 01:52:41,406
Right.

1873
01:52:46,621 --> 01:52:48,093
What's with the plows?

1874
01:52:48,158 --> 01:52:50,045
If you can't move this plane,
they will.

1875
01:52:50,141 --> 01:52:51,933
Shove an undamaged airplane
with snowplows?

1876
01:52:51,997 --> 01:52:53,597
Are you out of your mind?

1877
01:52:53,693 --> 01:52:55,102
No. I'm out of runways.

1878
01:52:55,165 --> 01:52:57,374
Think of what this baby costs.

1879
01:52:57,437 --> 01:52:59,294
I'm thinking of
that planeload of people.

1880
01:52:59,357 --> 01:53:01,214
This runway is their only hope.

1881
01:53:01,278 --> 01:53:03,101
If those snowplows
rip it apart,

1882
01:53:03,165 --> 01:53:05,021
chunks of fuselage
will be everywhere.

1883
01:53:05,054 --> 01:53:07,262
It's a chance
I've got to take.

1884
01:53:08,797 --> 01:53:11,933
OK, but you keep those toys
out of my hair...

1885
01:53:11,997 --> 01:53:14,494
and away from this airplane
for 15 minutes.

1886
01:53:14,557 --> 01:53:16,574
Maybe less.
I'll drive it out.

1887
01:53:16,637 --> 01:53:18,494
Joe, let's get one thing
straight.

1888
01:53:18,558 --> 01:53:20,606
When tower says
time is running out,

1889
01:53:20,702 --> 01:53:23,774
that's it, no arguments.
Plows will move on my order.

1890
01:53:28,798 --> 01:53:31,934
Get everybody and everything out
of the way. We're starting.

1891
01:53:31,998 --> 01:53:33,854
Get me somebody
that's cockpit-qualified.

1892
01:53:33,917 --> 01:53:36,318
All right, everybody,
we're clearing out!

1893
01:53:36,382 --> 01:53:39,454
And Chicago Center expects
to hand over in 12 minutes.

1894
01:53:39,517 --> 01:53:43,326
After that, our approach control
has the flight for 8-10 minutes.

1895
01:53:43,421 --> 01:53:45,054
We figure touchdown at 1:28.

1896
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:46,974
That's less time
than we figured.

1897
01:53:47,038 --> 01:53:49,214
Also, the runway choice
must be made...

1898
01:53:49,278 --> 01:53:51,454
no later than five minutes
before landing.

1899
01:53:51,518 --> 01:53:54,014
After that, they're committed.
They can't turn them.

1900
01:53:54,077 --> 01:53:57,342
-What'll we do now?
-Get out of the way and wait.

1901
01:54:07,326 --> 01:54:10,014
And holding 6,000
on heading 205.

1902
01:54:10,079 --> 01:54:12,255
What's the status
on runway two-niner?

1903
01:54:12,318 --> 01:54:14,174
No change.
We'll keep you advised.

1904
01:54:14,238 --> 01:54:15,678
Roger.

1905
01:54:18,303 --> 01:54:20,287
Mobile One, snow desk.

1906
01:54:21,758 --> 01:54:23,134
Go ahead, Danny.

1907
01:54:23,198 --> 01:54:26,334
The equipment is in position,
standing by, ready to move.

1908
01:54:30,847 --> 01:54:33,694
Roger. But be clear-
if the plows go in,

1909
01:54:33,758 --> 01:54:35,839
I'll give the order-
no one else.

1910
01:54:35,935 --> 01:54:37,439
Right. Better you than me.

1911
01:54:37,534 --> 01:54:39,934
You'll do a hatchet job
on that plane.

1912
01:54:39,998 --> 01:54:42,526
Then the owners
will do the same to you.

1913
01:54:42,623 --> 01:54:46,174
If the owners were on the plane,
they'd agree with me.

1914
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:49,759
-Roger. Standing by.
-Mobile One, ground control.

1915
01:54:49,854 --> 01:54:53,343
The Center estimates hand-off to
Lincoln approach control at 17.

1916
01:54:53,406 --> 01:54:56,222
This gives you 11 minutes
to make a decision.

1917
01:54:56,255 --> 01:54:59,615
I must be kept informed of exact
status of approaching flight.

1918
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:01,182
Can we hold
this frequency clear?

1919
01:55:01,247 --> 01:55:04,543
Affirmative. We've moved regular
traffic to another frequency.

1920
01:55:04,607 --> 01:55:08,415
Can you also put stuck 707 on
same frequency so I can monitor?

1921
01:55:08,479 --> 01:55:11,679
-Roger.
-May I speak to Patroni?

1922
01:55:11,742 --> 01:55:13,088
That's OK.

1923
01:55:17,311 --> 01:55:19,583
Approach control,
who's taking the hand-off?

1924
01:55:19,614 --> 01:55:21,247
Frank has east arrivals.

1925
01:55:23,711 --> 01:55:25,695
Continental 73,
due to emergency,

1926
01:55:25,791 --> 01:55:28,575
continue to hold at Joliet.
Maintain 8,000.

1927
01:55:28,671 --> 01:55:31,775
The Center will hand off
Global two in three minutes.

1928
01:55:31,872 --> 01:55:34,014
He's all yours.
Stick with it.

1929
01:55:34,110 --> 01:55:35,455
We'll take everything else.

1930
01:55:35,551 --> 01:55:38,015
You'll have the runway
as soon as we know.

1931
01:55:38,111 --> 01:55:39,007
Right.

1932
01:55:49,535 --> 01:55:52,511
OK, son... let's get going.

1933
01:55:57,984 --> 01:56:00,351
Ready to start. Pressurize.

1934
01:56:07,071 --> 01:56:08,670
Light on number three.

1935
01:56:21,312 --> 01:56:22,975
30 miles east of the airport,

1936
01:56:23,071 --> 01:56:26,496
contact Lincoln approach
control. 118 point niner.

1937
01:56:26,592 --> 01:56:28,863
-Good luck.
-Roger.

1938
01:56:30,015 --> 01:56:31,456
Lincoln approach, Global two.

1939
01:56:32,671 --> 01:56:34,176
Global two,
Lincoln approach control.

1940
01:56:34,272 --> 01:56:36,415
We're still hoping
for runway two-niner.

1941
01:56:36,512 --> 01:56:38,976
We should know
in three to five minutes.

1942
01:56:39,071 --> 01:56:41,535
Roger, Lincoln. Keep us advised.

1943
01:56:41,631 --> 01:56:45,215
Global two,
25 miles east of outer marker,

1944
01:56:45,312 --> 01:56:47,136
turn right, heading 260.

1945
01:56:47,231 --> 01:56:49,888
Begin descent at your
discretion to 2,000.

1946
01:57:49,345 --> 01:57:52,416
Hold it, Doug. Don't commit
that flight to runway 22.

1947
01:57:52,513 --> 01:57:55,552
There'll be a change in
two-niner's status any moment.

1948
01:57:55,617 --> 01:57:56,545
Roger.

1949
01:57:58,272 --> 01:58:01,537
-Snow desk, Mobile One.
-Go ahead, Mel.

1950
01:58:01,633 --> 01:58:03,072
Start the plows.

1951
01:58:04,193 --> 01:58:05,088
Roger.

1952
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:10,689
Conga leader, snow desk. Move.

1953
01:58:14,433 --> 01:58:16,897
Joe, this is Mel.
There's no more time.

1954
01:58:16,993 --> 01:58:20,449
Stop all engines. Get out.
Repeat. Stop all engines.

1955
01:58:23,713 --> 01:58:26,305
Mr. Patroni,
she won't take much more.

1956
01:58:26,369 --> 01:58:28,608
Well, anyway,
she's going to get it.

1957
01:58:37,153 --> 01:58:40,577
Joe, the plows are moving.
Shut down and hold on!

1958
01:58:40,672 --> 01:58:43,488
Joe Patroni, do you read me?
Acknowledge.

1959
01:58:45,473 --> 01:58:46,785
Joe, shut down!

1960
01:58:46,849 --> 01:58:49,665
Don't you hear?
We have to shut down!

1961
01:58:49,698 --> 01:58:51,809
Can't hear a thing.
There's too much noise.

1962
01:58:51,906 --> 01:58:53,729
Hold on! We're going for broke.

1963
01:59:22,113 --> 01:59:24,673
The instruction book
said that was impossible.

1964
01:59:24,738 --> 01:59:27,457
That's one nice thing
about the 707.

1965
01:59:27,553 --> 01:59:29,441
It can do everything but read.

1966
01:59:36,897 --> 01:59:38,306
Light up two-niner.

1967
01:59:45,313 --> 01:59:48,098
Instructing aircraft
remove from runway two-niner.

1968
01:59:48,194 --> 01:59:50,818
-I'm inspecting for debris.
-Roger. Standing by.

1969
01:59:56,226 --> 01:59:58,081
Runway two-niner clear and open.

1970
01:59:58,146 --> 02:00:00,993
Global two, turn right,
heading 285.

1971
02:00:01,058 --> 02:00:02,786
Runway two-niner is now open.

1972
02:00:04,033 --> 02:00:06,818
Roger, Lincoln. You've
just freed the slaves again.

1973
02:00:06,913 --> 02:00:08,514
Request P. A. R. approach.

1974
02:00:08,546 --> 02:00:09,697
Global two, Roger.

1975
02:00:09,793 --> 02:00:12,706
This will be a precision radar
approach to runway two-niner.

1976
02:00:12,802 --> 02:00:15,586
Stand by. We'll pick you up
on another scope.

1977
02:00:17,954 --> 02:00:19,618
-How's it handling?
-Real sluggish.

1978
02:00:21,122 --> 02:00:22,498
What was that?

1979
02:00:22,594 --> 02:00:25,506
A bump! Now shut up
and move over!

1980
02:00:32,963 --> 02:00:35,074
One bounce, we might
leave the tail behind.

1981
02:00:36,354 --> 02:00:39,522
Heads down! Keep your arms
under your pillow!

1982
02:00:41,954 --> 02:00:43,298
Heads down!

1983
02:00:47,266 --> 02:00:48,578
We're going to crash!

1984
02:00:48,674 --> 02:00:50,882
We'll be killed!
I know we're all-

1985
02:00:50,947 --> 02:00:52,323
Ohh!

1986
02:00:56,354 --> 02:01:00,899
Maintain heading 285. Position:
8 miles from the airport.

1987
02:01:00,994 --> 02:01:04,995
Final approach turn in one mile.
Maintain 2,000 feet.

1988
02:01:05,059 --> 02:01:07,746
You need not acknowledge
further transmissions.

1989
02:01:12,674 --> 02:01:15,458
Global two, turn right,
heading two-niner-five.

1990
02:01:15,555 --> 02:01:17,859
Approaching glidepath
in one mile.

1991
02:01:17,954 --> 02:01:20,067
You're cleared to land
runway two-niner.

1992
02:01:20,163 --> 02:01:23,683
Wind 300 degrees.
30, gusting 35.

1993
02:01:32,514 --> 02:01:35,523
Now intercepting glidepath.
Begin normal rate of descent.

1994
02:01:36,675 --> 02:01:38,019
On course.

1995
02:01:38,147 --> 02:01:41,218
If no transmissions received
for five seconds on final,

1996
02:01:41,315 --> 02:01:44,803
abandon radar approach and make
straight-in I. L. S. approach.

1997
02:01:49,155 --> 02:01:53,379
Now six miles from touchdown.
Course and glidepath good.

1998
02:01:53,475 --> 02:01:57,219
Now drifting left.
Turn further right, heading 305.

1999
02:01:57,315 --> 02:02:00,067
Slightly high on glidepath.
Adjust your descent.

2000
02:02:05,346 --> 02:02:06,915
Keep your head down!

2001
02:02:09,987 --> 02:02:12,099
Passing five
miles from touchdown.

2002
02:02:12,195 --> 02:02:14,979
Going through glidepath.
Adjust your descent.

2003
02:02:15,076 --> 02:02:17,923
Now 100 feet low.
Ease your aircraft up.

2004
02:02:22,755 --> 02:02:26,179
Four miles from touchdown.
Turn left, heading 301,

2005
02:02:26,275 --> 02:02:27,939
returning to glidepath.

2006
02:02:28,035 --> 02:02:30,819
Now on glidepath.
Check wheels down and locked.

2007
02:02:30,915 --> 02:02:32,323
Cleared to land.

2008
02:02:36,483 --> 02:02:39,299
Three miles from touchdown.
Course good.

2009
02:02:39,395 --> 02:02:42,179
Slightly low on glidepath.
Ease it up a little.

2010
02:02:42,275 --> 02:02:44,644
Surface wind gusting
to 35 knots.

2011
02:02:48,676 --> 02:02:52,676
Two miles from touchdown.
Course good. Glidepath good.

2012
02:02:52,707 --> 02:02:55,523
Looks OK. Advise when
approach lights in sight.

2013
02:03:00,676 --> 02:03:03,844
-We've got the lights.
-Roger. Good luck.

2014
02:03:06,916 --> 02:03:09,059
-Checklist complete?
-Checklist complete.

2015
02:03:09,156 --> 02:03:11,556
-I'll need help with the rudder.
-Right.

2016
02:04:16,228 --> 02:04:17,924
-Right rudder.

2017
02:04:44,837 --> 02:04:48,165
OK if Jordon watches
the right side for a minute?

2018
02:04:53,956 --> 02:04:55,429
I'll be right back.

2019
02:04:55,525 --> 02:04:57,253
Global two, welcome home.

2020
02:04:57,317 --> 02:04:59,972
Need a tow,
or can you taxi? Over.

2021
02:05:02,278 --> 02:05:05,605
Global two, again,
need a tow or can you taxi?

2022
02:05:06,917 --> 02:05:08,294
We can taxi.

2023
02:05:16,677 --> 02:05:19,493
-How is she?
-I think she'll be all right.

2024
02:05:19,558 --> 02:05:21,765
-Can I speak to her?
-Go ahead.

2025
02:05:26,436 --> 02:05:28,806
Gwen... it's Vern.

2026
02:05:30,597 --> 02:05:34,437
Can you hear me?
If you can, squeeze my hand.

2027
02:05:40,037 --> 02:05:43,525
Hold on. You'll be all right.
We're going to make it.

2028
02:06:01,829 --> 02:06:05,797
P. A.: Please do not obstruct
the tourist jetway.

2029
02:06:05,894 --> 02:06:07,845
Open the gate.
Get that down here!

2030
02:06:10,470 --> 02:06:11,973
-Mel!

2031
02:06:12,037 --> 02:06:13,893
They're down.
Everything's fine.

2032
02:06:13,958 --> 02:06:15,814
-I was watching television-
-I know.

2033
02:06:15,877 --> 02:06:18,918
The news picked up the mayday
and flashed it everywhere.

2034
02:06:19,013 --> 02:06:20,294
They're all right.

2035
02:06:20,358 --> 02:06:22,854
P. A.: All passengers
will deplane...

2036
02:06:22,918 --> 02:06:24,838
through the first-class
jetway.

2037
02:06:26,469 --> 02:06:29,317
Come on. Stand back, please.
Let us through here.

2038
02:06:29,349 --> 02:06:31,814
-I'd like a statement.
-I'll have one later.

2039
02:06:31,877 --> 02:06:33,479
You can talk
to the captain, too.

2040
02:06:33,509 --> 02:06:35,654
Please stand back.
This is too important.

2041
02:06:35,717 --> 02:06:38,214
-We need a wheelchair.
-A wheelchair!

2042
02:06:38,278 --> 02:06:39,814
I'm Mrs. Demerest.
Is Captain-

2043
02:06:39,877 --> 02:06:41,989
-He's coming off that jetway.
-Thank you.

2044
02:06:44,998 --> 02:06:46,854
Move back.
Let these folks through.

2045
02:06:46,919 --> 02:06:48,454
Get these people over there.

2046
02:06:48,518 --> 02:06:50,055
Step back, please. Step back.

2047
02:06:50,117 --> 02:06:52,614
Those of you who aren't
helping, step back.

2048
02:06:52,678 --> 02:06:54,886
Sit down in a central area.

2049
02:06:57,318 --> 02:07:00,615
Sit down right here.
Sit down right here, please.

2050
02:07:00,678 --> 02:07:02,118
We'll notify your families.

2051
02:07:02,214 --> 02:07:03,557
Judy!

2052
02:07:03,590 --> 02:07:05,446
Oh, thank God!

2053
02:07:09,318 --> 02:07:13,606
Stay in this area,
senora... in this area.

2054
02:07:21,254 --> 02:07:22,278
-Oh, madam.
-Oh, oh!

2055
02:07:22,342 --> 02:07:26,566
-I'm sorry, but that's my coat.
-I'm sorry, too.

2056
02:07:29,478 --> 02:07:32,423
Come on, let's move back.
Let's move back, please.

2057
02:07:36,679 --> 02:07:37,735
Hey!

2058
02:07:41,479 --> 02:07:45,254
I'm so sorry!
He didn't mean it.

2059
02:07:47,239 --> 02:07:49,447
He-he-he didn't mean it.

2060
02:07:51,239 --> 02:07:52,807
I'm sorry!

2061
02:07:54,119 --> 02:07:56,519
-I'm so sor-
-Inez.

2062
02:07:56,582 --> 02:07:57,958
I'm sorry!

2063
02:08:00,679 --> 02:08:02,214
I'm Dr. Nash, airport physician.

2064
02:08:02,278 --> 02:08:05,414
I'm Dr. Compagno. A stewardess
has splinters in her eye.

2065
02:08:05,479 --> 02:08:06,759
They may have penetrated.

2066
02:08:06,822 --> 02:08:09,895
An ambulance is waiting
to take her to the hospital.

2067
02:08:09,959 --> 02:08:12,134
An ophthalmic surgeon's waiting.
Any other complications?

2068
02:08:12,199 --> 02:08:15,495
She has a fractured right arm.
They'll probably use a general.

2069
02:08:15,559 --> 02:08:17,735
Before they decide
which type of anesthesia,

2070
02:08:17,798 --> 02:08:19,206
tell them she's pregnant.

2071
02:08:20,647 --> 02:08:22,087
Here she comes.

2072
02:08:29,798 --> 02:08:32,295
It's all right.
We'll take care of her.

2073
02:08:32,359 --> 02:08:33,767
I'm going with her.

2074
02:08:57,639 --> 02:08:59,304
Nice going, sweetheart.

2075
02:08:59,367 --> 02:09:02,568
Remind me to send a thank-you
to Mr. Boeing.

2076
02:09:16,199 --> 02:09:18,696
Good morning.
First class or economy?

2077
02:09:18,759 --> 02:09:20,327
First class.

2078
02:09:24,423 --> 02:09:27,944
You know, it was much more fun
the other way.

2079
02:09:30,120 --> 02:09:32,936
I'm too keyed up to sleep.
What about breakfast?

2080
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,207
Good idea.
Where should we go?

2081
02:09:36,328 --> 02:09:37,415
Your apartment.

2082
02:09:37,480 --> 02:09:40,008
Well, you've been bragging
about your scrambled eggs.

2083
02:09:40,103 --> 02:09:42,663
It's time I found out
how good they are.

2084
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:46,696
Mr. Bakersfeld?

2085
02:09:46,760 --> 02:09:49,160
Maintenance just called.
The snow blowers got damaged.

2086
02:09:49,256 --> 02:09:52,936
Mike wants you to decide whether
to work overtime to repair them.

2087
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,624
-Tell him to do it himself.
-Yes, sir.

2088
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:17,000
