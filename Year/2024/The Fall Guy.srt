not sure what's going on there,

67

-but...
-Let me guess-- too much face.

Okay, guys. Go to one for me.

-Jody, right?
-What's your name again?

71
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:48,402
As you can see,
that is not my chin.

72
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,738
When you look at my face, look
at my jaw compared to his jaw,

73
00:02:50,772 --> 00:02:52,372
it's like his chin is off.

74
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,641
-It's like... -Yeah,
we can't replace his face.

75
00:02:53,675 --> 00:02:55,275
It's like Mr. Potato Head.

76
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,811
-I mean, no offense or
anything, but you know. -Oh...

77
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,279
Oh, yeah, no. Sorry, I got lost
in your beautiful jawline.

78
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:00,948
-It's dreamy.
-No, listen,

79
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:02,617
we're just saying
it's not working for us.

80
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,686

-Okay.

81
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:06,219

82
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,354
Oh, yeah, no,
we're gonna have to go again.

83
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,256
-Okay. Okay.
-Yeah. -100%.

84
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:10,692
I don't know, man.
Do you think, um...

85
00:03:10,725 --> 00:03:12,459
Try and make some magic?

86
00:03:12,492 --> 00:03:14,494
Maybe you could do it backwards
or something? I don't know.

87
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,597

-Yeah.

104
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:45,993
Uh, yeah. It just looked
just now like you wanted

105
00:03:46,027 --> 00:03:47,695
-to ask me something.
-Oh.

106
00:03:47,729 --> 00:03:49,797
I was gonna go for
a spicy margarita after work.

107
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:51,899
I was wondering
if you drink spicy margaritas.

108
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,604
Um, well,
just to keep it professional,

109
00:03:56,637 --> 00:03:58,506
I can only have
one spicy margarita.

110
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:01,509
Because if I have two,
I start making bad decisions.

111
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:03,410
Well, you know,
drinking margaritas

112
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,279
is all about
making bad decisions.

113
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:08,381
Which reminds me, um,

114
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:11,586
after this job, I-I got to go
sit on the sand somewhere,

115
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:14,354
and I was wondering, uh...
I was gonna ask you a question.

116
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,823
Tell me.

117
00:04:16,724 --> 00:04:19,326
Do you have any towels
that I can borrow?

118
00:04:20,728 --> 00:04:22,029
Yeah, I have some towels.

119
00:04:22,063 --> 00:04:23,865
You know, it's so dangerous
to swim alone.

120
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,635
Well, I would ask you to,
you know, be my swim buddy,

121
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,637
but I don't know
if you have a bathing suit.

122
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:33,040
Wait a second. What do you
call that across the pond?

123
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:36,010
We call it a swimming costume.

124
00:04:38,345 --> 00:04:39,647

125
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,649

127
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:46,386

-Okay, good to go.

00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:19,006
Where I know you from, bro?

173
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,677
Oh, yeah, you were on
that Tom Ryder movie I was on.

174
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,812
-You're the stunt guy!
-Not anymore.

175
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:27,648
-Did you, like, break your back
or some shit? -I did, yeah.

176
00:07:27,682 --> 00:07:31,919
I know things haven't been easy
for you since... the incident.

177
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:33,521
And I just hope

178
00:07:33,554 --> 00:07:36,524
that you don't hold it
against me or Tom.

179
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,960
You know, we were
absolutely devastated.

180
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:40,594
He sent you a message, right?

181
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,898
The prayer hands emoji?

182
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,634
Right, yeah.
He's still an asshole.

183
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,536
How are you even still alive?
Yo, babe.

184
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:49,971
-Babe, hey, come here.
-I don't know.

185
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:51,539
-I wish I wasn't right now.
-You got to meet this guy.

186
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:52,840
Come here.
You got to hear this.

187
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,775
You don't have to hear this.
It's fine. Hi.

188
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:56,277
This dude was on a movie
I was on.

189
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:00,581
-Most epic fail I've ever seen.
-Mm.

190
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:02,149
<i>I don't blame</i>
<i>either one of you, Gail.</i>

191
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:03,684
That was my fault.

192
00:08:03,718 --> 00:08:05,553
And when you start
making mistakes like that,

193
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:06,821
it's time to hang up the pads.

194
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,622
Oh, it was an accident, Colt.

195
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,725
Everybody knows that.

196
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:14,962
Tom has put me
in a real situation here, Colt.

197
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:17,898
I just need a little bit
of help from an old friend,

198
00:08:17,932 --> 00:08:20,634
who just happens to be,
you know, the best stuntman

199
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,136
I've ever worked with
in my life.

200
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:24,939
Which is why you are getting
on a plane for me tomorrow

201
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,307
and coming to Sydney.

202
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,009
I'm not getting
on a plane, Gail.

203
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:30,144
I can't bear that you would
throw away all that talent.

204
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,613
You shouldn't be
parking cars, Colt.

205
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,216
You need to be smashing
burning Kawasakis

206
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:36,584
through panes of glass.

207
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,819
Yo, fall guy? Yo.

208
00:08:38,853 --> 00:08:41,889
Bring my car back
without a scratch,

209
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:44,525
I got a crispy fiver
here for you, bro.

210
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:08,682
Come on.
It's gonna be like old times.

211
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:10,284
I know you've missed it.

212
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:11,685
Goodbye, Gail.

213
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:13,687
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait. Hold on.

214
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:15,790
Did I, did I tell you-- I--
Did I tell you

215
00:09:15,823 --> 00:09:17,591
that the director's
asked for you specifically?

216
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,993
Sorry to disappoint him.

217
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,095

to know who it is? -Nope.

I didn't realize they were,
uh, scanning doubles now.

252
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,453
Eh, it's new technology.

253
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:28,756
Basically, we use
the geometry of your face

254
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,124
to retarget Ryder's face,

255
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:32,793
and we put Ryder's face
back on top of your face.

256
00:11:32,826 --> 00:11:35,229
Like a deepfake situation.

257

If you get a chance, turn me
into Tom Cruise, would you?

258
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,902
Hey, welcome to Sydney.
Are you Colt Seavers?

259
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:44,338
Yeah. Hey. Do you know
where I can get some coffee?

260
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,207
This jet lag
is really kicking in.

261
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,441
Yeah, no stress. I got you.

262
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,343
And does the director know
I'm here?

263
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,744
-She asked for me.
-Uh...

264
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:51,879
Does-does she want
to say hi or...?

265
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:53,847
I haven't heard.
No, sorry, bro.

266
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,482
Uh, but the stunt coordinator
wants to see you.

267
00:11:55,517 --> 00:11:58,018
-He's just in the jacket there.
-Okay, great.

268
00:11:58,052 --> 00:11:59,920
Will you just tell her
I'm here and...

269
00:11:59,954 --> 00:12:01,422
you know, that coffee
if you get a chance?

270
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:02,856
Oh.

271
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,124
Dan Tucker.

272
00:12:04,158 --> 00:12:07,127
Big-time Hollywood
stunt coordinator.

273
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:09,496
It's about time.

274
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:11,265
Congratulations.

275
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:12,866
Thank you. Look at you.

276
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,002
So do I call you "sir" now,
or how does that work?

277
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:16,971
Oh, feel free
to call me "boss," you know.

278
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,305
Okay, boss.

279
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:20,207
I don't think I should be
in this Nomex, right?

280
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:22,276
I mean, it's like, we're not
doing anything crazy, are we?

281
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,545
I was just about
to explain that.

282
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:25,279
A cannon roll?!

283
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,348
It's time for you to start
rolling cars again

284
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:28,782
instead of parking them.

285
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:30,851
You had an accident.

286
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:33,988
It was a massive
miscalculation of the rig.

287
00:12:34,021 --> 00:12:35,856
I-I almost killed myself
in front of the whole crew.

288
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,992
You know, I'd rather just not
have my first stunt back

289
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:40,261
be another epic failure,
especially in front of Jody.

290
00:12:40,294 --> 00:12:41,563
I mean, you understand.

291
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:44,164
"It's not about how hard
of a hit you can give."

292
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:46,166
-Oh.
-"It's about how many times

293
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,104
-you can get hit and keep
moving forward." -Come on.

294
00:12:50,137 --> 00:12:53,274
That's messed up. You can't
quote Rocky on me like that.

295
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:56,143
So it's a laser gun
with a dagger?

296
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,978
-Yes,
like a bayonet. -Right.

297
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:59,547
Do we need the bayonet?
Wouldn't the laser achieve...

298
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:01,148
On the battlefield, yes.
Hundred percent.

299
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,150
It just gives it
a quite a strange shape.

300
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,586
-Oh, this guitar bit at the end?
-Yeah.

301
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:06,220
Yeah, well, you said
you wanted metal,

302
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:07,888
so it's, like, heavy metal.

303
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,591
Okay, how-how... how many
have you done like this?

304
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:11,025
-Uh, two.
-Okay. Good.

305
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:13,060
-Hundred.
-Ooh. Okay. Yeah, fantastic.

306
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:15,195
-Thanks, boss.
-Okay. It looks like a guitar.

307
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:17,164
-Yes. -Nigel, how we doing
on the pyrotechnics?

308
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,899
-What's going on? -I think we
only have enough for one take.

309
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:20,301
-Boss! Boss, listen.
-No. Come on. -Yes.

310
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,136
-Yes? -We could create
something that looks

311
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:23,871
-way more realistic with VFX.
-No, no, no.

312
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,105
-Come on. Give it to me.
-Venti, Venti, Venti.

313
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:26,608
I don't want real.
I don't want real.

314
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:28,610
-This is a sci-fi epic,
cosmic love story. -Why?

315
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:30,177
Okay? Of cosmic proportions.

316
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,313
It's got to mirror
that otherworldly thing

317
00:13:32,346 --> 00:13:33,914
when you fall in love.

318
00:13:33,947 --> 00:13:35,349
You know, it's-it's imperfect.
It's beautiful.

319
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:36,884
I want it that way, okay?

320
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,620
-Let's go big with
our one take, okay? -Okay.

321
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:40,054
Holy shit.

322
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,188
Was that it?
Was that my one take?

323
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,456
Uh, I'm sure we have--

324
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,158
Oh, my God!

325
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,627
Well, I got to say, though,
looks absolutely fantastic.

326
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,027
-Boss. Listen, listen.
-Look at that.

327
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:48,462
You sure you want
to use real pyros?

328
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,997
-Yeah. -But we
definitely don't need this.

329
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,332
-No, no, no, no. Yeah.
-We don't.

330
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:52,866
Well, we're just gonna
have to loop the actors.

331
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,201
-That's all.
-That's okay, Ray.

332
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,936
It's a stuntman in a car
with a helmet on, okay?

333
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,204
-Oh. Uh, all right.
-No looping. No monologuing.

334
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,339
What the hell is going on
over there, Rush?

335
00:13:58,372 --> 00:13:59,507
We did not call for pyro.

336
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,908
I will seriously
track down your family

337
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,076
and kill every last one of them!

338
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,578
This is why they're doing it.

339
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:05,379
'Cause they feel you don't
respect them, Nigel, okay?

340
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,147
-It's my tone. -Your tone,
your words, all of it, just...

341
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:09,350
-I see, okay. -Jody? Jody?
-Darla, yes? Okay. Yeah.

342
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,218
Jody, um, sorry, I...
I couldn't get my printer

343
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:12,654
-working last night...
-Okay, yep.

344
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:14,188
...but I sort of synthesized
our conversation

345
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:16,090
that we had on the third act,
and what if

346
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:19,093
one of the characters in the
film acknowledges in the film

347
00:14:19,126 --> 00:14:21,428
that we're having a problem
with the third act?

348
00:14:21,462 --> 00:14:23,097
-Yeah?
-No. No.

349
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,498
But I appreciate you thinking
outside the box, Darla.

350
00:14:24,532 --> 00:14:25,600
I really, really do.

351
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,301
Nigel, you've got to stop them.

352
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:28,670
-I will gut you like the pigs
that you are! -Oh, my God.

353
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:30,371
-Stop testing!
-Whoo!

354
00:14:30,404 --> 00:14:31,606
-Boss!
-Yep?

355
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,641
-Test went well.
-Fantastic.

356
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:36,511
Okay, so, guys, simmer down.
Eyes on me.

357
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:38,045
Here's what's gonna happen.

358
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,913
No VFX, Venti.
It looks absolutely fabulous.

359
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:41,649
Nigel, we need to shoot now.
The tide's coming in.

360
00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:43,083
Let's go.
The shot's gonna be epic.

361
00:14:43,117 --> 00:14:45,452
Shot's up in five, people.
Thank you.

362
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,332
Colt? Brother?

363
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:00,267
What's happening, man?

364
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,437
-Bad sand.
-Bad sand.

365
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,005
Yeah.

366
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,541
I think we got to postpone.
Hate to say it.

367
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:08,676
Dan, what's the delay, please?

368
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,645
Uh, we're just doing
a little safety check.

369
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:12,012
It's the density.
It's bad density.

370
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:13,947
We're looking at
the density of the sand.

371
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:15,115
There's a new driver.

372
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:16,450
-Who is it? Where's Henry?
-No idea.

373
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,952
Nigel, this is
the biggest shot of the film,

374
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:20,454
and I have a newbie.

375
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,157
-Dan says we can do it.
-Okay.

376
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,026
Seriously, we're gonna drift
all over the place.

377
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,461
What is that, a king tide?

378
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:29,296
Here's what you do.
You wait till it comes in.

379
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:32,232
It compacts the sand,
then we shoot sunset for sunup.

380
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:33,167
You're stalling.

381
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,035
-Maybe.
-You're stalling.

382
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,739
-Two things can be true.
-Brother, I've got

383
00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:40,441
a tent full of
rookie Australians out here.

384
00:15:40,474 --> 00:15:41,576
I'm gonna be sick.

385
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:43,177
You got this. You're the one.

386
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,344
-Why you got to say that?
-Okay?

387
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:45,312
Why you got to say that?

388
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:46,748
You've done this
a million times.

389
00:15:46,781 --> 00:15:49,149
And so have you.
You know, you just jinxed it.

390
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,452
You just jinxed it!

391
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:53,120
Hey, Dan, I need the driver
in the car now, please.

392
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,321
-Okay, the tide's coming up.
-Okay.

393
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,590
Thank you so much.
Appreciate you.

394
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:56,624
-Is that Jody?
-Yes, it's Jody.

395
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:00,160
She say something about me?

396
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:03,363
Stop with-- your-your face.
Stop it. Stop it.

397
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:05,667
She didn't say
anything about you.

398
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,502
Get in the car!

399
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:12,005
This is really important to her.

400
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,407
Yes, it's important to her.

401
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,076
-Is this Comic-Con or something?
-Hall H.

402
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:18,746
"This is one of those times,

403
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,249
whether it's an inch or a mile,
a win is a win."

404
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:26,253
That's easy.
<i>Fast and the Furious.</i>

405
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:27,387
Ah!

406
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:29,624
Let's go. You got this.

407
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:31,058
Did you see the coffee lady?

408
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:32,192
She was wearing, like, a hat.

409
00:16:32,226 --> 00:16:33,661
-I see you in the car.
-Okay.

410
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,296
Let's get
the medics in place, please.

411
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,499
This is the hero set.
I've got five more after that.

412
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:39,767
Are you ready, Dan? Yeah.

413
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:42,069
-Rock and roll.
-Lock it up!

414
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:44,271
-Thank you.
-Three minute away--

415
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,206
Okay, folks,

416
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,675
he's buckled in.
Stunts are ready.

417
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:49,243
Godspeed, Colt.

418
00:16:49,276 --> 00:16:51,111
Everybody knows their spots.

419
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,113
Everybody knows
their responsibilities.

420
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,248
FX, please go hot on the cannon.

421
00:16:54,281 --> 00:16:55,550
Do this right.

422
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,217
Okay, engaging the cannon now.

423
00:16:57,251 --> 00:16:58,520
We do this safe
and everybody goes home.

424
00:16:58,553 --> 00:17:00,254
Charging the cannon.

425
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:02,757
2,000 PSI in the cannon.

426
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,391
Stunts is good.

427
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:06,393
Cannon is hot.

428
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:08,128
Cameras, where are we at?

429
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:09,463
Are you rolling? Camera one?

430
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,098
-Speed on one.
-Camera two?

431
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:12,399
-Speed.
-Camera three?

432
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:13,801
Speed on three.

433
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:21,843
Background.
And three, two, one.

434
00:17:21,876 --> 00:17:23,611
Action, action, action!

435
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:30,484
All right, guys, stay frosty.

436
00:17:30,518 --> 00:17:33,021
Three, two, one!

437
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:42,329
-Dan, I need him close to the
camera now. -Copy that!

438
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,832
Look,
I don't want to be that guy,

439
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:46,500
but the sand's a little loose.

440
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:48,168
I can't get any traction.

441
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,671
When I do, it jumps,

442
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:52,439
so if you get any closer,
you're gonna lose the camera.

443
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,241
I know, I know,
but get in there.

444
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,476
-You got this, baby!
-Move up, move up.

445
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:00,447
No, no, not that close.
Oh. What the--

446
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,550
Keep rolling.

447
00:18:02,584 --> 00:18:04,418
We have seven more cameras.
Keep rolling!

448
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,253
Okay!

449
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:09,356
Ready in three, two, one!

450
00:18:33,915 --> 00:18:35,349
Nobody goes in

451
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:36,884
until stunts gives
the all clear.

452
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,860
-Is he all right?
-Colt, you all right?

453
00:18:45,893 --> 00:18:47,829
Quickly, get him.
Come on, get him.

454
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:49,329
-Just get in there.
-Oh, my God.

455
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:52,232
-Easy, easy.
-Colt, you did it!

456
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,901
Eight and a half rolls!

457
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:56,236
Come on, you okay? You good?

458
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,906
You good? Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

459
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:02,944
Jody's coming. Hold on. Okay.

460
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:04,378
So good, Dan. Is he good?

461
00:19:04,411 --> 00:19:05,747
-Yeah, of course.
-So good, so good.

462
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,649
Loved it, loved it.

463
00:19:07,682 --> 00:19:09,349
-Incredible.
-Okay.

464
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:20,460
Whose idea was this?

465
00:19:21,663 --> 00:19:23,665
-I think it was Gail's idea.
-I thought it was your idea.

466
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:25,900
I-I just found out
about this yesterday.

467
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:27,568
Dan, come on.

468
00:19:27,602 --> 00:19:30,303
I didn't approve him.
I didn't approve him.

469
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,606
I would never have approved him.

470
00:19:31,639 --> 00:19:32,840
She didn't approve me.

471
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:33,908
Can I talk to you for a second?

472
00:19:33,941 --> 00:19:35,208
I'm not approved.

473
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,944
Interesting move. Really.

474
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:39,781
Really interesting.
Just very casual.

475
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:43,751
Here you are, you show up,
and, "I'm your new stuntman."

476
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:56,496
Don't do that.

477
00:19:56,531 --> 00:19:58,700
-Don't do that.
You can't do that. -What?

478
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,702
-Directing a movie.
-Your hat's coming off.

479
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,738
Why are you here?

480
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:06,273
-I think there's been
a misunderstanding. -Clearly.

481
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:09,342
Because I was under
the impression that...

482
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:11,813
...you did want me here.

483
00:20:11,846 --> 00:20:13,648
That's a delusional thought.
We haven't spoken in a year.

484
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:15,016
-Let's not get into it.
-Gail, Gail-- But Gail told me

485
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,751
-that you wanted me here.
-Okay. Whatever.

486
00:20:16,784 --> 00:20:18,452
I don't even care about it,
but you clipped the camera.

487
00:20:18,485 --> 00:20:20,688
I-I-I'm a little rusty.

488
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:22,523
-Comic-Con shot ruined.
-I'm sor-- I know.

489
00:20:22,557 --> 00:20:24,792
-Hall H. It's a big deal.
-Yeah. Yeah.

490
00:20:24,826 --> 00:20:26,794
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

491
00:20:26,828 --> 00:20:28,796
I'm happy for you.

492
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,267
This whole director thing
looks good on you.

493
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:36,604
Even the gardening hat, somehow.

494
00:20:36,637 --> 00:20:40,340
Everyone wears them.
It's like a set thing.

495
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,009
-Okay?
-Yeah, I see it. It's--

496
00:20:42,043 --> 00:20:44,478
They're not making it look
as good as you are, that's all.

497
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:47,280
And I'm not trying to be fla--
I'm just saying the facts.

498
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,950
But you look good in everything.

499
00:20:48,983 --> 00:20:51,451
You look good in nothing.
Whatever.

500
00:20:51,485 --> 00:20:52,887
-No, I don't mean it like that.
-Really? This isn't...

501
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,522
-But you do look good
in nothing. -This isn't work--

502
00:20:54,555 --> 00:20:55,923
-This isn't gonna work.
-I mean, you do.

503
00:20:55,957 --> 00:20:58,258
But it's not what I...

504
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,763
-I'll take anyone. Anyone else.
-Yeah.

505
00:21:01,796 --> 00:21:03,664
-Anyone but him.
-Can I be honest with you?

506
00:21:03,698 --> 00:21:06,333
-Who have you got? Yep.
-We literally have no one else.

507
00:21:07,535 --> 00:21:10,303
-What's next?
-The fire burn.

508
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,508
It's your call.

509
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,375
-Okay. -Can we get
a nurse on standby, please?

510
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:17,377
We're gonna set
this man on fire.

511
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:36,697
-Cut, cut, cut.
-That's a cut.

512
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:39,033
-Cutting there, please.
-That's a cut!

513
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:43,938
How you feeling, Colt Seavers?

514
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:45,372
-He's good.
-He's all good.

515
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:47,474
We're gonna go again.
Thumbs-up, okay?

516
00:21:47,508 --> 00:21:48,943
Technical issue.
Little bump on the dolly.

517
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:51,411
-Huh?
-Can you fix that, Jimmy?

518
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:52,780
-Back to ones, please.
-Thank you.

519
00:21:52,814 --> 00:21:54,682
-Going again.
-Please, back to one.

520
00:21:54,715 --> 00:21:56,651
Colt, do you feel a bit
flung into the deep end here?

521
00:21:56,684 --> 00:21:58,753
I'm just wondering, 'cause
you haven't read the script,

522
00:21:58,786 --> 00:22:00,121
if you'd like some backstory,
some context?

523
00:22:00,154 --> 00:22:02,089
-Would that be good?
-Just go with it.

524
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:03,791
Yeah, helpful?
Okay. Here we go.

525
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:06,627
So, sci-fi love story,
two characters,

526
00:22:06,661 --> 00:22:08,930
one of them's an alien--
Aliena--

527
00:22:08,963 --> 00:22:10,598
and you're Space Cowboy.

528
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:12,567
They shared what's called
a moon season.

529
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,936
In real life,
you might call it a fling.

530
00:22:14,969 --> 00:22:17,839
Um, brief but very intense.

531
00:22:17,872 --> 00:22:20,541
And... hopeful.

532
00:22:21,576 --> 00:22:24,011
Now, neither of them
had ever been in a relationship

533
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:25,847
that deep before.

534
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,749
And they told each other that
over and over and over again.

535
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:30,751
Him more than her,
you know, to the point where

536
00:22:30,785 --> 00:22:32,620
sometimes she was like,
"Chill out," you know.

537
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:35,455
But anyway,
in a tragic turn of events,

538
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:40,695
Space Cowboy is wounded,
and he just disappears.

539
00:22:41,896 --> 00:22:43,496
Without a trace.

540
00:22:48,836 --> 00:22:50,037
I can keep going.

541
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:52,472
I can hit the rock
better now, thanks.

542
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:53,741
We're going again!

543
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:58,145
Sound speed.

544
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:00,014
And action!

545
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:04,518
That's a cut!

546
00:23:04,552 --> 00:23:06,087
Cutting there, please.

547
00:23:08,723 --> 00:23:10,157
-Everything okay?
-You good?

548
00:23:10,191 --> 00:23:12,492
For a little more
context, Colt,

549
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:14,161
Aliena's sort of devastated.

550
00:23:14,195 --> 00:23:16,429
And she starts sort of
replaying everything

551
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:17,832
in her head over and over again.

552
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:19,901
Did she misread the vibe?

553
00:23:19,934 --> 00:23:21,168
Was it just a fling?

554
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:24,138
Did she let her imagination
run wild again?

555
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:26,107
Or did he lie to her?

556
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,542
Was he full of shit?

557
00:23:30,144 --> 00:23:31,579
But let me be clear:

558
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:33,781
eventually, Aliena did move on.

559
00:23:33,814 --> 00:23:35,549
All right?

560
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,752
And she started doing Pilates.

561
00:23:37,785 --> 00:23:41,488
Got herself
a banging revenge body,

562
00:23:41,522 --> 00:23:43,791
and then she started dating
other humans.

563
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:45,660
One after another.

564
00:23:45,693 --> 00:23:47,762
And she had
so many mind-blowing,

565
00:23:47,795 --> 00:23:51,065
far superior experiences,
you wouldn't even believe it.

566
00:23:51,098 --> 00:23:52,465
-Right, girls?
-Yeah.

567
00:23:52,499 --> 00:23:54,068
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah. Yeah.

568
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:55,236
Yeah, it was like a sushi train.

569
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:57,872
I'm gonna be sick.

570
00:23:57,905 --> 00:23:59,707
And do you know what?
We're gonna go again, Colt,

571
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,609
'cause there was
a little buzz on that one.

572
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:03,077
Okay, light him up.

573
00:24:03,978 --> 00:24:06,147
Last one, everybody. Action!

574
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,953
It-It's just feeling
so withheld,

575
00:24:11,986 --> 00:24:13,754
so how 'bout some dialogue?

576
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:15,156
Yeah, that's all right, Darla.

577
00:24:15,189 --> 00:24:16,824
I'm gonna go
straight to the source.

578
00:24:16,857 --> 00:24:20,027
Hey, Colt, if Space Cowboy
had to say something,

579
00:24:20,061 --> 00:24:23,264
if he was forced to say
something, what would he say?

580
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:24,832
How would he justify

581
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:26,634
this year she's spent
spinning out over this?

582
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:28,169
What could he say?
It's a puzzler, isn't it?

583
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:30,705
-But have you got any thoughts?
-Uh, maybe he could talk...

584
00:24:30,738 --> 00:24:32,139
Nigel, can you, can you
get him a bullhorn?

585
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:34,075
I can't hear him.

586
00:24:34,108 --> 00:24:35,576
Traveling.

587
00:24:44,285 --> 00:24:45,853
Come again, Colt.
What was that?

588
00:24:45,886 --> 00:24:47,989
-It's already on.
-In this movie,

589
00:24:48,022 --> 00:24:51,993
do the aliens and the humans
ever talk...

590
00:24:52,026 --> 00:24:53,627
in private?

591
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:56,263
-No, not really.
-No private conversations?

592
00:24:56,297 --> 00:24:57,832
No, they don't like
doing private.

593
00:24:57,865 --> 00:24:59,200
Like, they like
to keep it very public.

594
00:24:59,233 --> 00:25:01,035
-Very open.
-Oh.

595
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,141
Well, maybe I'll just, uh,
open it up to the group here.

596
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:11,078
Have you ever been in one of
those situations where...

597
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,215
...you want to say something
and it's so important

598
00:25:14,248 --> 00:25:15,883
that you can't mess it up?

599
00:25:15,916 --> 00:25:21,055
So, you think
long and hard about it,

600
00:25:21,088 --> 00:25:23,324
and then you realize...

601
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:25,059
you've already messed it up?

602
00:25:25,092 --> 00:25:30,064
'Cause you've thought
too long and too hard about it?

603
00:25:31,332 --> 00:25:33,100
You're...

604
00:25:33,134 --> 00:25:34,802
What's that?

605
00:25:35,736 --> 00:25:37,938
You want...

606
00:25:42,243 --> 00:25:43,778
I had a similar situation

607
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:46,113
when I fell in love
with my wife's sister.

608
00:25:46,147 --> 00:25:47,615
-Okay. All right. What...
-No.

609
00:25:47,648 --> 00:25:49,817
No. Okay.

610
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,819
Uh...

611
00:25:51,852 --> 00:25:54,321
And again,
this is hard because...

612
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:56,223
you know, I haven't
read the script.

613
00:25:56,257 --> 00:25:57,925
But...

614
00:25:59,827 --> 00:26:01,996
...he'd probably say...

615
00:26:03,664 --> 00:26:05,833
...that he's been living...

616
00:26:07,835 --> 00:26:10,604
...in total regret since then.

617
00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:13,340
You know, afraid...

618
00:26:13,374 --> 00:26:15,276
that he'll never get
an opportunity

619
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:17,111
to make it up to her...

620
00:26:18,712 --> 00:26:20,181
...because he waited too long.

621
00:26:20,214 --> 00:26:21,949
And...

622
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:26,353
...she's probably moved on.

623
00:26:26,387 --> 00:26:27,855
Uh, sorry, Jody,

624
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:30,791
speaking of moving on,
we, uh...

625
00:26:32,393 --> 00:26:34,728
One more?

626
00:26:39,233 --> 00:26:41,602
I'd love another chance.

627
00:26:44,839 --> 00:26:46,807
-Roll it, Nigel.
-Let's turn over, please!

628
00:26:46,841 --> 00:26:48,709
-All cameras are rolling.
-Shot's up, sound speeding.

629
00:26:48,742 --> 00:26:50,010
Okay, light him up!

630
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:53,848
Action! Thank you!

631
00:27:01,322 --> 00:27:03,023
Gail?

632
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:06,427
Gail?

633
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,729
Oh. Coffee.

634
00:27:17,238 --> 00:27:19,006
Mm! You're here.

635
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,407
Oh, no, don't use that.
It's broken.

636
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:23,144
Eight and a half rolls?

637
00:27:23,177 --> 00:27:26,147
That is a world record!

638
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,949
Thank you so much.

639
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:31,752
It's better than parking cars,
isn't it?

640
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,055
Would you cut the shit, Gail?

641
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:37,291
What? It was amazing.
What are you talking about?

642
00:27:37,324 --> 00:27:39,693
She doesn't want me here, Gail.

643
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:41,095
Yes, she does.

644
00:27:41,128 --> 00:27:42,463
Oh, of course she does.

645
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:45,199
-You lied. You lied.
-Oh.

646
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:47,334
-Colt.
-Do you know how that feels?

647
00:27:47,368 --> 00:27:49,170
I think you deserve
a second chance.

648
00:27:49,203 --> 00:27:53,040
It's, like, the message
in all my movies.

649
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:54,975
What's the message
in all my movies?

650
00:27:55,009 --> 00:27:57,178
Uh...

651
00:27:57,211 --> 00:27:59,747
Nihilism's a viable worldview?

652
00:28:00,981 --> 00:28:03,784
No, that's just
the entertainment.

653
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:05,753
That's like the...

654
00:28:05,786 --> 00:28:07,454
like the sexy bacon.

655
00:28:07,488 --> 00:28:09,223
-What is this?
-You know? It's like dogs.

656
00:28:09,256 --> 00:28:12,326
You got to wrap the message...

657
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,295
in some sexy bacon.

658
00:28:15,262 --> 00:28:17,932
I mean, all those movies,
people fall down.

659
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:19,733
They're rolling
in their own shit.

660
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:22,203
They don't think they can cope,
but they can. They get back up.

661
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:23,938
Do you mind if I lay down?

662
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:26,807
With the multiple fire burns
and the cannon rolls

663
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,376
-and the jet lag, I just...
-Yep, yep, yep.

664
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,078
...could use a little shut-eye.

665
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:31,812
Yep.

666
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:33,914
Okay, let me get this straight.

667
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:37,851
-Nihilism is the sexy bacon?
-Yeah.

668
00:28:37,885 --> 00:28:39,521
The audience are dogs?

669
00:28:39,554 --> 00:28:40,988
There we go.

670
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:44,091
And when you fall down,
you get back up.

671
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:46,026
-Thank you.
-I'm glad we did this.

672
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,263
Now, what am I
really doing here, Gail?

673
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:53,200
Um...

674
00:28:53,234 --> 00:28:54,235
Ryder's missing.

675
00:28:54,268 --> 00:28:55,803
He has fallen in

676
00:28:55,836 --> 00:28:59,106
with some shady,
shitty, shitty people.

677
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:01,242
Well, Gail...

678
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:03,844
...call the cops.

679
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:05,212
I can't call the cops.

680
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:06,548
Well, why not?

681
00:29:06,581 --> 00:29:09,383
The studio will know
that I am way over budget.

682
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,151
They will pull the plug on this.

683
00:29:11,185 --> 00:29:13,487
You know that.

684
00:29:13,521 --> 00:29:15,022
Please go and find him.

685
00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:16,090
Why me?

686
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:18,125
You're a stuntman,
for God's sake.

687
00:29:18,158 --> 00:29:20,394
No one's gonna notice
whether you're here or not.

688
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:22,296
-No offense.
-I mean, some taken.

689
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:25,132
You know him intimately.

690
00:29:25,165 --> 00:29:26,800
It can be so simple.

691
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:29,504
You pick him up,
you dust him off,

692
00:29:29,537 --> 00:29:30,871
you bring him back here.

693
00:29:30,904 --> 00:29:32,273
I know I can trust you.

694
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:34,074
And you know who can
trust you more than anyone,

695
00:29:34,108 --> 00:29:37,011
she just doesn't
realize it yet, is Jody.

696
00:29:37,044 --> 00:29:39,980
This is her big chance.

697
00:29:40,014 --> 00:29:42,850
Do you want her first movie
to be her last?

698
00:29:42,883 --> 00:29:45,219
You've got to help me out, man.

699
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:49,056
It's been a long couple days.

700
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:52,026
I'm gonna go to the hotel,
I'm gonna--

701
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:54,895
What is it? It's my yesterday,
it's your tomor--

702
00:29:54,928 --> 00:29:56,163
I'm gonna call you
your tomorrow.

703
00:29:56,196 --> 00:29:57,998
-Right, no. Today.
-My today.

704
00:29:58,032 --> 00:29:59,567
That is the door code
of Ryder's loft.

705
00:29:59,601 --> 00:30:01,503
The patio door.
Took it from his trailer.

706
00:30:01,536 --> 00:30:03,337
He's still doing
this Post-it note thing?

707
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,573
Oh.
Let's not even get into that.

708
00:30:05,607 --> 00:30:08,242
At this point,
it's like <i>Memento</i> level.

709
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:11,111
I can only keep this
from Jody and the studio

710
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:13,280
48 hours max.

711
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:14,616
Save Jody's movie,

712
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:17,351
and maybe you get
the love of your life back.

713
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:21,455
Did you just turn Jody
into the sexy bacon?

714
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:24,526
She's been
the sexy bacon all along.

715
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,993
You're good.

716
00:30:26,026 --> 00:30:28,329
It's the only left-hand drive
I have.

717
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:32,266
Please don't wreck it.
It's product placement.

718
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:34,602
There's only two of them.

719
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:37,104
I know how you stunties drive.

720
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:42,976

Uh, just, uh, chilling down.

739
00:32:18,238 --> 00:32:20,307
Were you "chilling down"
to Taylor Swift?

740
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,109
-Yep.
-Mm.

741
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:23,645
It's just something
Australians say.

742
00:32:23,678 --> 00:32:25,279
Really? I've been here for six
months, I've never heard it.

743
00:32:25,312 --> 00:32:26,714
Yeah, "chilling down under,"
you know,

744
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:28,148
but it's shorter to say
"chilling down."

745
00:32:28,182 --> 00:32:30,250
-Have you been crying?
-Not at all.

746
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:32,119
You look like
you've been crying.

747
00:32:33,487 --> 00:32:35,255
Jet lag.

748
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:38,192
That was so dangerous,
and I'm very sorry.

749
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:40,260
Lighting you up like that.

750
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,664
It was very cathartic.

751
00:32:42,697 --> 00:32:45,132
-I feel better.
-I deserved it.

752
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:50,471
I'm gonna make the camera
up to you, by the way.

753
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:53,006
Can I get in the car with you?

754
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:57,277
Clean your face. You're a mess.

755
00:33:00,515 --> 00:33:01,749
So how have you been?

756
00:33:01,783 --> 00:33:04,384
Oh, you know.

757
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,354
Yeah? Thumbs-up?

758
00:33:07,387 --> 00:33:10,424
God, I hate that bullshit,
that stunt guy bullshit.

759
00:33:11,693 --> 00:33:12,794
And that's fine.

760
00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:14,228
You don't have to
explain anything.

761
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:16,096
It's all good. It was a fling.

762
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:18,198
Less than a fling. It was
a flingette, and that's fine.

763
00:33:18,232 --> 00:33:19,701
I don't even want to know.

764
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:22,369
And the problem with forcing
something is you get nowhere.

765
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:24,238
You know, one time my mom
forced my dad to exercise.

766
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:26,106
Do you know what happened?

767
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:27,709
Snapped his ankle first time
he stepped on the treadmill.

768
00:33:27,742 --> 00:33:30,444
She forced it, now he has
a piece of metal in his foot.

769
00:33:30,477 --> 00:33:32,747
Moral of the story is
you should just be you.

770
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:37,585
Well, look, I've thought
a lot about this, actually,

771
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:39,086
and I, uh...

772
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,420
It's not like
I didn't want to apologize

773
00:33:40,454 --> 00:33:42,422
a million times.

774
00:33:42,456 --> 00:33:43,525
Yeah.

775
00:33:43,558 --> 00:33:46,260
Uh, it's just, every time I...

776
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:52,432
You know, when I think of
something to say...

777
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:57,404
...doesn't seem like enough.

778
00:34:02,577 --> 00:34:04,311
Okay.

779
00:34:04,344 --> 00:34:05,847
No problem.

780
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,816
Boundaries. Boundaries.

781
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,250
That's important.

782
00:34:10,284 --> 00:34:11,753
Because I have
a lot of pressure on me.

783
00:34:11,786 --> 00:34:15,690
You have no idea how hard it was
for me to make this movie, okay?

784
00:34:15,723 --> 00:34:18,091
I just need to focus,
so if you're gonna stay here,

785
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,427
we need to keep it...

786
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,129
like, super profesh.

787
00:34:22,797 --> 00:34:24,197
"Professional"
is my middle name.

788
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,333
Mm-hmm.

789
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:29,671
I thought your middle name
was "Danger."

790
00:34:29,704 --> 00:34:32,472

-You're in <i>Metalstorm.</i>
-Yeah.

858
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,696
Hey, were you
in that movie <i>Carjacked</i>

859
00:38:48,729 --> 00:38:50,363
where that guy named Jack
steals your car

860
00:38:50,397 --> 00:38:51,566
and then you shoot him
in the hand and you say,

861
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,834
"I hope you know
how to drive stick"?

862
00:38:52,867 --> 00:38:54,635
And it doesn't make sense
'cause it's like,

863
00:38:54,669 --> 00:38:56,469
should be "automatic,"
but the way you say it...

864
00:38:56,504 --> 00:38:58,338
That's Naomi Watts!

865
00:39:03,611 --> 00:39:04,779
I'm just a stunt guy.

866
00:39:04,812 --> 00:39:06,714
I'm working on <i>Metalstorm,</i> too.

867
00:39:06,747 --> 00:39:09,884
You lie!
We're only on <i>Metalstorm 1.</i>

868
00:39:09,917 --> 00:39:11,786
I meant also!

869
00:39:29,904 --> 00:39:31,438
Is this a prop sword?

870
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:33,875
Mm-hmm. I'm a good actress.

871
00:39:33,908 --> 00:39:37,144
Hey, if you are
really working on <i>Metalstorm,</i>

872
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:38,846
why are you
sneaking around here?

873
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,615
Just trying to find Ryder.

874
00:39:40,648 --> 00:39:43,084
He's, like, really drugged up
and paranoid right now.

875
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:44,819
He thinks someone's
trying to kill him.

876
00:39:44,852 --> 00:39:47,922
And I'm like, "If you don't
finish <i>Metalstorm,</i>

877
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:50,457
I'm gonna kill you myself."

878
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,593
Now, there is
some dark shit going on.

879
00:39:52,627 --> 00:39:54,962
And the sooner I can get
out of here, the better.

880
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,465
Wow.

881
00:39:58,498 --> 00:40:00,167
Any idea where I could find him?

882
00:40:00,201 --> 00:40:02,904
Uh, you could try this club
he hangs out at.

883
00:40:02,937 --> 00:40:05,773
But you're never gonna get in
looking like a povo.

884
00:40:05,806 --> 00:40:08,743
-What's a povo?
-A poor person like you.

885
00:40:08,776 --> 00:40:10,611
Oh. Cool.

886
00:40:10,645 --> 00:40:13,714
What's with your
<i>Miami Vice</i> Stunt Team jacket?

887
00:40:13,748 --> 00:40:15,482
Oh, it was
the first show I ever did.

888
00:40:15,516 --> 00:40:18,920
I had to jump a boat
through a ring of fire.

889
00:40:18,953 --> 00:40:20,187
I got so good I could do it

890
00:40:20,221 --> 00:40:21,722
with my hands
tied behind my back.

891
00:40:23,057 --> 00:40:24,158
Wow.

892
00:40:24,191 --> 00:40:25,893
You're really into yourself.

893
00:40:27,695 --> 00:40:29,664
I mean, you know, you did ask.

894
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:31,232
It's neon night at the club.

895
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:32,867
<i>He's always there</i>
<i>with this guy called Doone</i>

896
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:34,235
<i>who's his drug dealer.</i>

897
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:35,836
<i>He's got, like,</i>
<i>leopard print tats on his head.</i>

898
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,539
<i>They won't let a nobody</i>
<i>like you into the club,</i>

899
00:40:38,572 --> 00:40:40,473
<i>so just act like Tom.</i>
<i>You're his stunt double.</i>

900
00:40:40,508 --> 00:40:41,876
You know how to do that,
don't you?

901
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:43,778
Yeah. I'll just act like
I own everything and everyone

902
00:40:43,811 --> 00:40:45,947
and there's no repercussions
for my actions.

903
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:50,184
♪ I do it like that... ♪

904
00:40:51,652 --> 00:40:54,555
Oh, my God. Is that Tom Ryder?

905
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:55,923
Hey, Tom!

906
00:40:57,825 --> 00:40:59,994
Stuntman! Yeah, yeah, Iggy said
you were gonna come see me.

907
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:01,529
Yeah, sit down, get a drink.

908
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:02,596
Hey, hey, get him a drink.
What do you want?

909
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,898
Oh, no, no, I'm good. I'm good.

910
00:41:03,931 --> 00:41:06,466
I'm just looking for Ryder.
You seen him?

911
00:41:07,601 --> 00:41:09,704
Get him a Shirley Temple.
Sit down, brother, sit down.

912
00:41:09,737 --> 00:41:12,073
Uh, honestly, no offense,
Mr. Doone.

913
00:41:12,106 --> 00:41:13,841
I just want to find Ryder.

914
00:41:13,874 --> 00:41:16,978
How come no one ever wants
to chat with the drug dealer?

915
00:41:20,081 --> 00:41:22,583
Sorry. I, uh...

916
00:41:22,616 --> 00:41:24,952
I mean no... no disrespect.

917
00:41:24,986 --> 00:41:27,121
Just had a long day.
Ryder hasn't shown up to work.

918
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:28,889
That was fast.

919
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:30,191
You do a stunt today?

920
00:41:30,224 --> 00:41:31,792
Uh, just a, yeah, car roll.

921
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:33,260
Just a car roll?

922
00:41:33,294 --> 00:41:35,629
Hear how he said that?
"Just a car roll!"

923
00:41:35,663 --> 00:41:37,598
What a stuntman! My man!

924
00:41:37,631 --> 00:41:39,233
It's what I do.

925
00:41:39,266 --> 00:41:40,534
Hey, that's why I like you.

926
00:41:40,568 --> 00:41:42,069
'Cause you do all the hard shit.

927
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:44,805
They give Oscars for that?

928
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:46,741
For stunts?

929
00:41:46,774 --> 00:41:48,275
No.

930
00:41:48,309 --> 00:41:49,744
Nope.

931
00:41:49,777 --> 00:41:51,846
Hey, to the unsung heroes.

932
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:53,914
-I'll drink to that.
-Yeah.

933
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,618
Mm!

934
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:00,654
No offense,
but I prefer cartoons.

935
00:42:00,688 --> 00:42:03,557
See, movies are always trying
to make things real.

936
00:42:03,591 --> 00:42:05,226
But it's not real.
It's a movie.

937
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:06,994
It's not meant to be real.

938
00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:08,829
That's why I like cartoons.

939
00:42:08,863 --> 00:42:10,164
See, 'cause cartoons

940
00:42:10,197 --> 00:42:11,298
don't pretend to be real.

941
00:42:12,967 --> 00:42:15,069
That's what I like about them.
You seen <i>Dumbo?</i>

942
00:42:15,102 --> 00:42:16,637
<i>-Dumbo?</i>
-Yeah, <i>Dumbo.</i>

943
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,172
<i>Dumbo</i> changed my life.

944
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:20,708
You know that scene when Dumbo
gets into the bad champagne,

945
00:42:20,741 --> 00:42:22,076
then he starts seeing
the pink elephants

946
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:23,077
on parade and shit?

947
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,211
I was like, "Yes, please.

948
00:42:24,245 --> 00:42:25,713
"I'll have what he's having!

949
00:42:25,746 --> 00:42:27,148
Make it a double!"

950
00:42:28,315 --> 00:42:30,184
Hey, stuntman?

951
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:31,852
Why don't you come with us?

952
00:42:31,886 --> 00:42:34,655
We'll get you nice and
comfortable at the hotel, huh?

953
00:43:19,834 --> 00:43:23,003
Move, move! Get out of the way!
Get-- Move! Come on!

954
00:43:24,205 --> 00:43:26,841
Get out the way!
Move! Get off me!

955
00:43:26,874 --> 00:43:28,175
Hey!

956
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:34,115
Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Taxi! Come on, come on.

957
00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:35,382
Come on, brother, let's go.

958
00:43:35,416 --> 00:43:37,952
-Go! -See you, mate.
-Be well, mate.

959
00:43:47,895 --> 00:43:49,663
What are you doing, Colt?

960
00:43:49,697 --> 00:43:51,999
You know what I'm doing.
I'm gonna stop this car.

961
00:43:52,032 --> 00:43:54,869
You're clearly high, Colt.
And you're clearly chickenshit!

962
00:43:54,902 --> 00:43:57,071
Okay, we don't have time for
this. Talk about this later.

963
00:44:05,913 --> 00:44:07,681
-Yeah, okay.
-Driver, what are you doing?

964
00:44:07,715 --> 00:44:09,884
Drive! Drive, bro!

965
00:44:09,917 --> 00:44:11,785
Listen. Hey, you need to chill.
Just relax. Just re--

966
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:13,454
Hey, just relax! I'm a lover,
not a fighter, okay? Just...

967
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:14,822
-Where's Ryder?!
-I just drugged you

968
00:44:14,855 --> 00:44:15,890
'cause they paid me to.

969
00:44:15,923 --> 00:44:17,358
Who's "they"?

970
00:44:17,391 --> 00:44:19,160
The guy that runs
Ryder's security.

971
00:44:19,193 --> 00:44:20,327
I deliver drugs to him

972
00:44:20,361 --> 00:44:21,862
at the Pendleton Hotel
sometimes, okay?

973
00:44:21,896 --> 00:44:22,796
-What room?
-Bro, I don't know what room.

974
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:24,165
You know, it changes.

975
00:44:24,198 --> 00:44:25,432
Just ask Kevin
for the, for the fruit plate.

976
00:44:25,466 --> 00:44:27,001
-He'll give you the key.
-Kevin?

977
00:44:27,034 --> 00:44:28,435
-Kevin! K-E-V-I-N. For the...
-I know Kevin!

978
00:44:28,469 --> 00:44:29,470
You know Kevin?

979
00:44:29,504 --> 00:44:31,005
I don't know Kevin.

980
00:44:31,038 --> 00:44:32,773
Well, then you're gonna
get to know Kevin.

981
00:44:32,806 --> 00:44:35,809
Ask him for a fruit plate,
and he'll give you keys.

982
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:37,111
How long does this last?

983
00:44:37,144 --> 00:44:38,812
-What?
-How long is this gonna last?

984
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:39,914
Bro, what are you even saying?

985
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:42,883
How... long does this last?

986
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:45,953
Oh. When you stop
seeing unicorns.

987
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:52,860
I'd like to speak to Kevin.

988
00:44:52,893 --> 00:44:55,029
Kevin's, uh, on a break.

989
00:44:55,062 --> 00:44:58,465
Okay, maybe you can help me.
Can I order the "fruit plate"?

990
00:44:58,499 --> 00:45:02,369
Okay. Do you want me
to call "room service"?

991
00:45:02,403 --> 00:45:04,305
I don't know.
Is that what happens?

992
00:45:04,338 --> 00:45:05,439
D-Do you have a room?

993
00:45:05,472 --> 00:45:07,107
-Should I just...
-Do I need one?

994
00:45:07,141 --> 00:45:08,309
To order the fr...

995
00:45:08,342 --> 00:45:09,376
-I...
-The fruit plate.

996
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,778
-Hey, Colt.
-Fruit plate.

997
00:45:11,412 --> 00:45:12,446
Woof, wow.

998
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:14,481
-That's a look.
-Hi. Hey.

999
00:45:14,516 --> 00:45:15,916
-What happened to your face?
-Hi.

1000
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:17,251
Hi. Okay.

1001
00:45:17,284 --> 00:45:18,953
-Sorry about that.
-Are you good?

1002
00:45:18,986 --> 00:45:20,254
-It's just good...
-What's wrong with you?

1003
00:45:20,287 --> 00:45:21,355
-It's good to see you.
-Wow, you look terrible.

1004
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:22,790
You look amazing.

1005
00:45:22,823 --> 00:45:24,225
Did you fall?
What happened to you?

1006
00:45:24,258 --> 00:45:25,893
Wow. You're so pretty.

1007
00:45:25,926 --> 00:45:27,294
-It's crazy.
-Okay. Your face is bleeding.

1008
00:45:27,328 --> 00:45:29,096
-What?
-What happened to you?

1009
00:45:29,129 --> 00:45:31,131
Oh. No, I was running.
Just-- I was running.

1010
00:45:31,165 --> 00:45:33,500
Very unusual athleisure wear
for a run.

1011
00:45:33,535 --> 00:45:35,102
-This?
-Yeah.

1012
00:45:35,135 --> 00:45:37,805
Yeah, they gave me
the wrong bags at the airport,

1013
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:39,173
but, you know, it's-- it works.

1014
00:45:39,206 --> 00:45:40,508
I can sweat.

1015
00:45:40,542 --> 00:45:42,009
If I'm gonna play Ryder,
I thought I should just,

1016
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:43,377
like, cut weight a little,
you know...

1017
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,512
You seem kind of tweaky.

1018
00:45:44,546 --> 00:45:47,081
I'm a little... spotty.

1019
00:45:47,114 --> 00:45:49,850
Like, when I--
my glucose levels get low.

1020
00:45:49,883 --> 00:45:51,285
I get a little...

1021
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:54,388
Okay, is that a new thing?

1022
00:45:54,421 --> 00:45:55,923
Is that a new thing?

1023
00:45:55,956 --> 00:45:57,124
-What's that?
-Is that a new thing?

1024
00:45:57,157 --> 00:45:58,892
-Is your hair new?
-Yes, I cut it.

1025
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:00,127
-I changed my hair.
-It's beautiful.

1026
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,829
You changed your number.
We're even.

1027
00:46:01,862 --> 00:46:04,064
I thought we'd sort of
even the score.

1028
00:46:04,098 --> 00:46:06,000
Yeah. I have a lot of new s--

1029
00:46:06,033 --> 00:46:07,501
You know, I've learned
a lot about myself

1030
00:46:07,535 --> 00:46:09,803
since-since we last
seen each other.

1031
00:46:09,837 --> 00:46:11,438
Why'd you disappear like that?

1032
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:13,941
God, I wanted
to be there for you.

1033
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:17,144
Yeah, but how's
she supposed to do quality work

1034
00:46:17,177 --> 00:46:18,580
if you keep harassing her
all the time?

1035
00:46:21,048 --> 00:46:23,050
Okay. Can you go
and grab your things?

1036
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:25,419
-We have really got to zip.
-Okay. Yep.

1037
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:26,887
-What's going on?
-Seriously.

1038
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,557
Colt, you're...

1039
00:46:29,591 --> 00:46:30,991
You look like you've been busy.

1040
00:46:31,025 --> 00:46:33,294
-Yeah, real busy, Gail.
-Yeah, good.

1041
00:46:33,327 --> 00:46:34,428
Lot of running around, Gail.

1042
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:36,397
We'll get a drink
and discuss that.

1043
00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:37,931
But right now, the studio...

1044
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:40,100
so far up my ass,
I can taste them.

1045
00:46:40,134 --> 00:46:41,603
-We need your third act.
-Okay. Yep.

1046
00:46:41,636 --> 00:46:43,203
You having problems
with the third act?

1047
00:46:43,237 --> 00:46:45,039
We're gonna, we're gonna go
and do things right now.

1048
00:46:45,072 --> 00:46:46,440
I need to write it.
I'm gonna go write it. I just--

1049
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:48,108
It's like
the studio are wanting me

1050
00:46:48,142 --> 00:46:50,512
to contort the love story
so that it all ends happily

1051
00:46:50,545 --> 00:46:51,979
and everything's rosy and...

1052
00:46:52,012 --> 00:46:53,314
-Jody, Jody, Jody.
-But I feel like if I...

1053
00:46:53,347 --> 00:46:56,917
lean into reality,
then maybe that's the way to go.

1054
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,953
And most love stories
don't end well. Usually.

1055
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:03,223
-Know what I mean?
-I strongly disagree with that,

1056
00:47:03,257 --> 00:47:06,226
so we should keep
chopping it up.

1057
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,394
Yeah? Should we?

1058
00:47:07,428 --> 00:47:09,496
It's important.
It's the ending.

1059
00:47:09,531 --> 00:47:11,298
Okay.

1060
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,602
Sir?

1061
00:47:14,636 --> 00:47:16,203
-Huh?
-Hi.

1062
00:47:16,236 --> 00:47:17,004
-Yeah.
-Hi.

1063
00:47:17,037 --> 00:47:19,340
Um, I hear that
you're interested

1064
00:47:19,373 --> 00:47:21,075
in a-a fruit platter.

1065
00:47:21,108 --> 00:47:22,544
-Kevin?
-Yes.

1066
00:47:22,577 --> 00:47:24,178
Yes. Okay, so...

1067
00:47:25,112 --> 00:47:27,481
It's-it's on... it's on ice.

1068
00:47:48,068 --> 00:47:50,404
Yep. There we go. Sorry.

1069
00:48:35,717 --> 00:48:37,317
Hello?

1070
00:48:37,351 --> 00:48:39,019
What do you
think about split screen?

1071
00:48:39,052 --> 00:48:41,021
-Jody?
-Yeah.

1072
00:48:41,054 --> 00:48:43,290
Is this okay I'm calling?
You said to call and...

1073
00:48:43,323 --> 00:48:45,693
-Yes. Yeah, it's fine.
-Yeah? We could chop it up?

1074
00:48:45,727 --> 00:48:47,729
It's, uh... Let's chop it up.

1075
00:48:47,762 --> 00:48:49,196
It's a good time.
I'm not doing anything.

1076
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:52,299
Okay. Great.
Uh, so, split screen, right?

1077
00:48:52,332 --> 00:48:54,368
Do you think that it's,
like, nostalgic super cool

1078
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:57,104
or do you think
it's a gimmick?

1079
00:48:57,137 --> 00:48:59,973
Um, I think
it could be super cool.

1080
00:49:00,007 --> 00:49:02,476
-Mm-hmm? -Yeah, how do you,
uh, want to use it?

1081
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:05,179
I mean, you know, tell me.
Tell me everything.

1082
00:49:05,212 --> 00:49:07,281
Tell me, you know,
about your vision.

1083
00:49:07,314 --> 00:49:09,249
So, I like that
they're on-screen together.

1084
00:49:09,283 --> 00:49:11,051
-But they are in
separate worlds... -Right.

1085
00:49:11,084 --> 00:49:13,153
...you know,
visually and emotionally.

1086
00:49:13,187 --> 00:49:15,456
So you've got
this very prominent divide

1087
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:16,724
between the lovers.

1088
00:49:16,758 --> 00:49:18,392
And I want that.

1089
00:49:21,328 --> 00:49:24,231
-You want the divide?
-I want the divide, yes.

1090
00:49:26,668 --> 00:49:28,268
Hmm.

1091
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:30,037
It's funny 'cause I-I didn't
get the impression

1092
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,072
that there was that much
keeping them apart.

1093
00:49:32,105 --> 00:49:34,274
Well, you haven't
read the script.

1094
00:49:35,442 --> 00:49:37,579
All I know so far is that
the alien lady and the cowboy

1095
00:49:37,612 --> 00:49:42,115
are having what seem to be
pretty manageable problems.

1096
00:49:42,149 --> 00:49:44,786
Jody? Jod-- How's this?

1097
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:46,386
Manageable problems?

1098
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,455
The aliens invaded Earth,
and they left it in tatters.

1099
00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:50,224
So this whole thing
the studio are pushing for,

1100
00:49:50,257 --> 00:49:51,659
the "love conquers all"
thing...

1101
00:49:51,693 --> 00:49:54,261
I'm not buying it.

1102
00:49:54,294 --> 00:49:57,599
Well, I have to admit that I'm
surprised to hear you say that.

1103
00:49:57,632 --> 00:49:59,333
Why?

1104
00:49:59,366 --> 00:50:01,769
Well, I'm just
a boy in a neon suit

1105
00:50:01,803 --> 00:50:03,771
standing in front of a girl,
reminding her

1106
00:50:03,805 --> 00:50:06,206
that <i>Notting Hill</i>
is her favorite movie

1107
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:09,343
and she watches <i>Love Actually</i>
every year at Christmas.

1108
00:50:09,376 --> 00:50:11,178
Well, you know,
I watched it again this year,

1109
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:13,648
and I didn't love it, actually.

1110
00:50:13,681 --> 00:50:15,517
-Wow, it's worse than I thought.
-Yeah, I'm ruined.

1111
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,785
Yeah, it's a really sad day
for <i>Notting Hi</i> as well.

1112
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:20,120
That "happily ever after"
stuff, unsubscribe me.

1113
00:50:20,153 --> 00:50:21,523
I didn't get "happily ever
after" from <i>Notting Hill.</i>

1114
00:50:21,556 --> 00:50:23,190
What are you talking about?
Of course you did.

1115
00:50:23,223 --> 00:50:24,726
-Did you?
-Yes, of course. They're ly--

1116
00:50:24,759 --> 00:50:26,761
They're on the park bench.
She's got her head in his knee.

1117
00:50:26,794 --> 00:50:28,095
She's a "regular girl."

1118
00:50:28,128 --> 00:50:29,429
Maybe, but we don't know
for sure

1119
00:50:29,463 --> 00:50:32,099
she's not gonna go back
to working the street.

1120
00:50:32,132 --> 00:50:33,433
All we know is that
in the beginning,

1121
00:50:33,467 --> 00:50:35,335
she's pretty much up for
anything but kissing,

1122
00:50:35,369 --> 00:50:37,104
and in the end,
she's open to kissing him.

1123
00:50:37,137 --> 00:50:39,139
-No. No.
-And it gives us hope.

1124
00:50:39,172 --> 00:50:40,474
You have got your Julia Roberts
movies so twisted.

1125
00:50:40,508 --> 00:50:41,809
And that's all we want.
A little hope.

1126
00:50:41,843 --> 00:50:43,210
No, that is <i>Pretty Woman,</i>

1127
00:50:43,243 --> 00:50:44,546
where she is
a lady of the night,

1128
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:45,747
and this is <i>Notting Hill,</i>

1129
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:46,814
where she's
a very famous actress.

1130
00:50:46,848 --> 00:50:48,315
Oh. Well, don't listen to me.

1131
00:50:48,348 --> 00:50:50,417
What do I know?
Look, you're the director.

1132
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:51,786
You're gonna make
the right choice.

1133
00:50:51,819 --> 00:50:53,555
I'm just saying,
for people like me,

1134
00:50:53,588 --> 00:50:55,455
who may not necessarily get the
metaphor of the split screen.

1135
00:50:55,489 --> 00:50:57,457
You may not get
the deeper metaphor,

1136
00:50:57,491 --> 00:50:58,458
but you're gonna see it.

1137
00:50:58,492 --> 00:51:00,427
You're gonna see
this bright line between them

1138
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,565
that we're gonna ache
to see blur.

1139
00:51:03,598 --> 00:51:05,332
You know, but maybe it can't.

1140
00:51:05,365 --> 00:51:07,669
-Mm.
-Maybe it doesn't.

1141
00:51:07,702 --> 00:51:10,505
Right. Right. Yeah.

1142
00:51:12,205 --> 00:51:14,241
But what do we know, right?

1143
00:51:14,274 --> 00:51:15,810
'Cause all we know at this point

1144
00:51:15,843 --> 00:51:18,613
is that the cowboy
likes the alien.

1145
00:51:18,646 --> 00:51:19,881
Does the alien like the cowboy?

1146
00:51:19,914 --> 00:51:21,849
She's on the fence.

1147
00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:23,183
Right.

1148
00:51:23,216 --> 00:51:24,852
Because they got problems.

1149
00:51:24,886 --> 00:51:29,591
Because she's an alien and he's
a cowboy, and that's a problem.

1150
00:51:29,624 --> 00:51:31,491
But is it a problem
they can't overcome?

1151
00:51:31,526 --> 00:51:32,894
Here's a question.

1152
00:51:32,927 --> 00:51:35,797
Are they even gonna try?

1153
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:37,497
What do you think?

1154
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:40,702
Do you think they're gonna try?

1155
00:51:41,936 --> 00:51:44,539
I think...

1156
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,241
I think this was
a great brainstorm.

1157
00:51:51,546 --> 00:51:53,815
So...

1158
00:51:53,848 --> 00:51:56,517
what'd you decide
about the split screen?

1159
00:51:56,551 --> 00:51:58,418
I have a better idea.

1160
00:51:59,754 --> 00:52:01,455
I don't think you need it.

1161
00:52:01,488 --> 00:52:04,157
I think the connection between
these characters is so strong

1162
00:52:04,191 --> 00:52:06,393
that nothing can
come between them.

1163
00:52:07,662 --> 00:52:09,363
Jod?

1164
00:52:10,598 --> 00:52:11,699
Jody?

1165
00:52:35,355 --> 00:52:37,625
-Hello?
-Dead guy on ice.

1166
00:52:37,659 --> 00:52:39,226
What?

1167
00:52:39,259 --> 00:52:42,664
There's a dead guy on ice
at the hotel, Gail.

1168
00:52:42,697 --> 00:52:44,532
Wait. Sorry.
What are you talking about?

1169
00:52:44,565 --> 00:52:45,933
Well, if you think
that doesn't make sense,

1170
00:52:45,967 --> 00:52:47,702
-don't order the fruit plate.
-Hold on.

1171
00:52:47,735 --> 00:52:49,771
You're seriously telling me
you've just seen a dead body?

1172
00:52:49,804 --> 00:52:51,405
Yes, Gail.

1173
00:52:51,438 --> 00:52:53,941
On the rocks. In the hotel.

1174
00:52:53,975 --> 00:52:55,308
What hotel?

1175
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:57,277
The one
I just saw you in, Gail!

1176
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:58,813
He was so dead, Gail.

1177
00:52:58,846 --> 00:53:00,882
He was very dead. Super dead.

1178
00:53:00,915 --> 00:53:02,382
Hold on.
How did you even get there?

1179
00:53:02,416 --> 00:53:04,619
Gail, you asked me
to do this! Okay?

1180
00:53:04,652 --> 00:53:07,320
-So please try and keep up.
-I know. I'm sticking.

1181
00:53:07,354 --> 00:53:09,724
I went to Ryder's apartment
just like you told me.

1182
00:53:09,757 --> 00:53:12,359
That's where Iggy with
the sword gave me the neon suit

1183
00:53:12,392 --> 00:53:14,929
and they sent me to the man
with the leopard print head.

1184
00:53:14,962 --> 00:53:16,698
He goes by the name of Doone.

1185
00:53:16,731 --> 00:53:18,800
It was Doone's goons
who dirtied my Shirley,

1186
00:53:18,833 --> 00:53:20,500
and not in a fun way, Gail.

1187
00:53:20,535 --> 00:53:22,837
I think they were
trying to kill me, Gail!

1188
00:53:22,870 --> 00:53:24,939
Step away and calm down.

1189
00:53:24,972 --> 00:53:26,708
I am gonna handle everything.

1190
00:53:26,741 --> 00:53:28,009
No more handling!

1191
00:53:28,042 --> 00:53:29,777
-I want the police!
-You're very aggressive.

1192
00:53:29,811 --> 00:53:32,379
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to yell.
I want the police.

1193
00:53:32,412 --> 00:53:33,848
You are not gonna talk
to the police.

1194
00:53:33,881 --> 00:53:35,482
You don't talk to anyone
about this, okay?

1195
00:53:35,516 --> 00:53:36,851
-You listen to me.
-I'm calling the police.

1196
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:38,285
You are not
talking to the police.

1197
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:39,754
-Excuse me, sir.
-Wait, who's there?

1198
00:53:39,787 --> 00:53:40,988
Who's there? Who's there?

1199
00:53:41,022 --> 00:53:42,389
It's the police.
I'm gonna talk to them.

1200
00:53:42,422 --> 00:53:43,725
No, no, no, no, no!
Don't talk...

1201
00:53:45,793 --> 00:53:48,696
No parking at any time.

1202
00:53:52,667 --> 00:53:54,769
Sorry.

1203
00:53:54,802 --> 00:53:56,369
Just making sure
we're both here.

1204
00:53:57,004 --> 00:53:58,039
I'm-I'm here, mate.

1205
00:53:58,072 --> 00:54:00,007
I want to report a crime.

1206
00:54:00,041 --> 00:54:01,776
-Okay.
-An ice crime.

1207
00:54:07,715 --> 00:54:10,484
Yeah. You're still
getting a ticket, mate.

1208
00:54:10,518 --> 00:54:12,252
All right.

1209
00:54:15,455 --> 00:54:16,858
<i>I got to tell Jody.</i>

1210
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:18,059
About the dead guy.

1211
00:54:18,092 --> 00:54:19,459
How do you know he was dead?

1212
00:54:19,493 --> 00:54:20,895
He could've just been
knocked out.

1213
00:54:20,928 --> 00:54:22,362
-On ice?
-Yeah.

1214
00:54:22,395 --> 00:54:25,398
Ice baths are very good
for inflammation.

1215
00:54:25,432 --> 00:54:27,769
And are you forgetting
that you were high?

1216
00:54:27,802 --> 00:54:29,402
How can I if you keep fixating

1217
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:30,638
-on that one point?
-Okay, you know what,

1218
00:54:30,671 --> 00:54:32,372
let me just stop you
right there.

1219
00:54:32,405 --> 00:54:33,875
Whatever you told Jody
last night

1220
00:54:33,908 --> 00:54:35,676
-has got her all fired up.
-I don't know what I said.

1221
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:36,944
About what?

1222
00:54:36,978 --> 00:54:38,311
And now I have to build a truck

1223
00:54:38,345 --> 00:54:40,548
-for a 250-foot jump.
-Huh?

1224
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:42,517
-In a day and a half!
-Sounds pretty cool, actually.

1225
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:44,652
And on top of that,
the fight scene today,

1226
00:54:44,685 --> 00:54:47,487
Jody has decided that she wants
to do it all in one take.

1227
00:54:47,522 --> 00:54:49,791
-A oner. -Dan, did you
tell him about the oner?

1228
00:54:49,824 --> 00:54:50,992
-Yes.
-So cool.

1229
00:54:51,025 --> 00:54:52,325
-Right?
-Yeah.

1230
00:54:52,359 --> 00:54:53,761
-So good. He's into it.
-Hi.

1231
00:54:53,795 --> 00:54:55,530
-Hey. Yeah, can I talk to you
for a second? -Okay,

1232
00:54:55,563 --> 00:54:58,099
-about this sequence today,
Ryder's a no-show. -Yeah.

1233
00:54:58,132 --> 00:54:59,567
Again, he's probably on
a bender or something.

1234
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,802
Well, it's interesting
you say that,

1235
00:55:00,835 --> 00:55:02,469
-because that's...
-Yeah.

1236
00:55:02,502 --> 00:55:04,071
-...that's what I want to talk
to you about. -Me, too.

1237
00:55:04,105 --> 00:55:06,007
-Me, too. Because we don't even
need him. -He...

1238
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,809
-Well... -We don't need him.
I had an epiphany last night.

1239
00:55:07,842 --> 00:55:08,976
Let me just tell you.

1240
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:10,545
-Last night?
-I was so excited.

1241
00:55:10,578 --> 00:55:12,814
-Yeah. -After we spoke,
it all came to me.

1242
00:55:12,847 --> 00:55:14,715
-Really? -Yeah,
the third act, this sequence,

1243
00:55:14,749 --> 00:55:16,818
-all of it. I've been s...
-After talking to me?

1244
00:55:16,851 --> 00:55:18,085
Yeah. You know, I was shocked

1245
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:19,620
-when you showed up. Right?
-Yeah.

1246
00:55:19,654 --> 00:55:22,089
-But...
-Well, it was... shocking.

1247
00:55:22,123 --> 00:55:23,891
But I just started to wonder
if maybe

1248
00:55:23,925 --> 00:55:25,827
you showed up
just at the right time, and...

1249
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:28,095
I've been going for this thing
in the action,

1250
00:55:28,129 --> 00:55:29,630
and I've never been able
to get it.

1251
00:55:29,664 --> 00:55:32,465
Like, this feeling
of the pursuit of love.

1252
00:55:32,499 --> 00:55:35,502
And how far would you go for
the one that you love and...

1253
00:55:35,536 --> 00:55:38,005
--You know?
And then...

1254
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:40,440
-Yeah. -You know, I realize
it's not very far with Ryder,

1255
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:41,709
-'cause he's a drip.
-Right.

1256
00:55:41,742 --> 00:55:43,443
-And he runs weird.
-Right.

1257
00:55:43,476 --> 00:55:45,079
-And he can't do action. But...
-Well, it's...

1258
00:55:45,112 --> 00:55:46,714
...you can.

1259
00:55:46,747 --> 00:55:47,882
You can.

1260
00:55:47,915 --> 00:55:49,449
I'm unlimited with you.

1261
00:55:49,482 --> 00:55:51,085
I can do everything
and everything with you,

1262
00:55:51,118 --> 00:55:52,820
and it just made my brain
just...

1263
00:55:53,921 --> 00:55:55,523
So cool.

1264
00:55:55,556 --> 00:55:56,724
-I don't need cuts.
I don't need gimmicks. -Really?

1265
00:55:56,757 --> 00:55:58,726
I don't need anything.
I just need you.

1266
00:55:58,759 --> 00:56:00,561
To finish this movie.

1267
00:56:00,595 --> 00:56:02,897
-You know, maybe even make it
a great movie. -Wow.

1268
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:04,131
You know?

1269
00:56:04,165 --> 00:56:06,466
-Wow. Okay.
-What do you think?

1270
00:56:06,499 --> 00:56:07,935
Do you want to work together?

1271
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:10,605
Shoot the shit out of Sydney
Opera House in four hours?

1272
00:56:10,638 --> 00:56:12,607
-Three hours and 52 minutes.
-Three hours and 52 minutes?

1273
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,808
Yeah.

1274
00:56:13,841 --> 00:56:15,076
What are we waiting for?

1275
00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:17,444
Okay, good.
Good! Okay!

1276
00:56:17,477 --> 00:56:18,946
Venti, Venti, come on.

1277
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,882
I'm gonna get some dots
on your face, 'cause I need you

1278
00:56:20,915 --> 00:56:22,850
-but not your face. -Oh, God.
Get-- Yeah, just get rid of it.

1279
00:56:22,884 --> 00:56:24,484
-Yeah, I'm gonna stick Ryder's
head on you. -All of it. Just--

1280
00:56:24,518 --> 00:56:26,554
-Okay. Cool. Okay, okay.
-Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1281
00:56:26,587 --> 00:56:28,956
Ready for a take?
Make it rain, please!

1282
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,061
Let me get out,
for Christ's sake.

1283
00:56:34,095 --> 00:56:35,162

we're gonna go do some karaoke,

Okay.

1323
00:58:34,782 --> 00:58:36,217
I don't know what that was.

1324
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:37,685
That was just so awful and...

1325
00:58:37,718 --> 00:58:39,620

-Holster that.
-It's holstered.

1328
00:58:42,323 --> 00:58:44,592
It's done. Forget.
You-you never saw it.

1329
00:58:47,762 --> 00:58:50,531
Jody, do you like
Christina or Britney?

1330
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:53,934
I saw that.

1331
00:58:53,968 --> 00:58:57,204
-You saw the finger guns?
-Oh, I saw the finger guns.

1332
00:58:58,372 --> 00:59:00,007
She started it.

1333
00:59:00,041 --> 00:59:01,842
Hi.

1334
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:03,711
I didn't ha--
I didn't have breakfast.

1335
00:59:03,744 --> 00:59:05,112
Yeah, you did.

1336
00:59:05,146 --> 00:59:06,914
-I disagree. -I gave you
a brekky wrap this morning.

1337
00:59:06,947 --> 00:59:08,816
Technically,
this is all meal penalty,

1338
00:59:08,849 --> 00:59:10,785
-if you want the... Oh.
-It's fine. Just-just sign.

1339
00:59:10,818 --> 00:59:12,353
-Thanks. -I'm just saying,
not everyone's gonna be as cool

1340
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:14,121
-about it as I am. You know?
-No, I get it.

1341
00:59:14,155 --> 00:59:15,790
What is this?

1342
00:59:15,823 --> 00:59:19,960
I've got you on a 5:55 flight
out of here. Okay?

1343
00:59:19,994 --> 00:59:21,662
-I have a car waiting for you.
-Now?

1344
00:59:21,695 --> 00:59:24,331
Engine's on. Yeah. Colt...

1345
00:59:24,365 --> 00:59:27,001
there is some serious shit
going down, okay?

1346
00:59:27,034 --> 00:59:29,870
I just told Jody I was gonna
meet her for karaoke.

1347
00:59:29,904 --> 00:59:31,705
And I'm actually embarrassed
that I got you here

1348
00:59:31,739 --> 00:59:33,707
and got you all tangled up.

1349
00:59:33,741 --> 00:59:35,743
I just want to get you out
of here before it escalates.

1350
00:59:35,776 --> 00:59:37,078
Get your stuff together.
We're going.

1351
00:59:37,111 --> 00:59:39,013
You're gonna miss the flight.
Thank you.

1352
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:40,681
-Sorry.
-Okay, but I'm late,

1353
00:59:40,714 --> 00:59:42,083
and I got to get Ryder's dogs
to daycare.

1354
00:59:42,116 --> 00:59:44,051
Fluffy needs her oatmeal bath.
She gets hives.

1355
00:59:44,085 --> 00:59:46,387
Hey, should I be
looking for another job, Alma?

1356
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:48,222
You're Ryder's assistant.
You must know.

1357
00:59:48,255 --> 00:59:51,692
All I can tell you is that
if Ryder is a no-show tomorrow,

1358
00:59:51,725 --> 00:59:53,360
the studio will shut us down.

1359
00:59:53,394 --> 00:59:55,362

1370
01:00:42,009 --> 01:00:43,410
I worked with him on a movie,
you know.

1371
01:00:43,444 --> 01:00:44,912
Can't believe he kept him.

1372
01:00:44,945 --> 01:00:46,413
Well, it's more for
a party trick, really.

1373
01:00:46,447 --> 01:00:47,982

So, the last time I saw Tom,
everything was pretty normal.

1384
01:01:09,103 --> 01:01:11,872
<i>He and Henry were</i>
<i>in some kind of drug-induced,</i>

1385

<i>grappling match.</i>

1386
01:01:13,941 --> 01:01:16,710
But then Gail called me early
the next morning in a panic.

1387
01:01:16,744 --> 01:01:17,978
Drop whatever you're doing.

1388
01:01:18,012 --> 01:01:19,480
Tom has lost his phone again.

1389
01:01:19,514 --> 01:01:21,882
So I found the phone,
the one that Dressler,

1390
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:24,752
Ryder's creepy security goon,
just called me about.

1391
01:01:24,785 --> 01:01:26,253
<i>Metalstorm</i> crew,
we have a call time

1392
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:27,821
-of 6:00 a.m. tomorrow. Don't
be late. -All right, mate.

1393
01:01:27,855 --> 01:01:30,024
All right, thanks, mate!

1394
01:01:30,057 --> 01:01:32,393
-Hey. Two shots of tequila,
please. -Ooh, Gail.

1395
01:01:32,426 --> 01:01:34,195
-Hey.
-Wow.

1396
01:01:34,228 --> 01:01:36,096
I didn't think you liked
coming to these things.

1397
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:38,332
What are you talking about?
I love listening to people

1398
01:01:38,365 --> 01:01:40,935
murder my favorite songs.
Thank you.

1399
01:01:40,968 --> 01:01:42,336
-Mmm.
-"Gin and Juice."

1400
01:01:42,369 --> 01:01:43,904
I got to get to karaoke.

1401
01:01:43,938 --> 01:01:45,940
Hey!

1402
01:01:45,973 --> 01:01:47,141
Thanks, Amy.

1403
01:01:47,174 --> 01:01:48,342
Au revoir, Jean-Claude.

1404
01:01:48,375 --> 01:01:49,476
You got to get rid
of that thing.

1405
01:01:49,511 --> 01:01:50,978
Why don't you just give it
to Gail?

1406
01:01:51,011 --> 01:01:52,980
Whatever's on this phone
is a goddamn bazooka

1407
01:01:53,013 --> 01:01:54,815
that'll blow
a movie star-sized hole

1408
01:01:54,848 --> 01:01:56,283
through somebody's career.

1409
01:01:56,317 --> 01:01:58,953
I'm happy to get this
into the hands of a good guy.

1410
01:01:58,986 --> 01:02:01,222
-Okay...
-For the right price.

1411
01:02:01,255 --> 01:02:03,090
What do you want for it?

1412
01:02:03,123 --> 01:02:04,391
A producer credit.

1413
01:02:04,425 --> 01:02:05,926
On <i>Metalstorm?</i>

1414
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:06,927
Look, I need
career protection, okay?

1415
01:02:06,961 --> 01:02:08,128
I'm burning myself with this.

1416
01:02:08,162 --> 01:02:09,396
I'm a stunt guy.

1417
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:11,232
What am I supposed to do
about it?

1418
01:02:11,265 --> 01:02:13,000
You're a stunt guy
who used to date the director

1419
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:15,002
and seems to be getting close
to rekindling

1420
01:02:15,035 --> 01:02:17,972
some sort of short but
legendary torrid love affair.

1421
01:02:18,005 --> 01:02:19,406
Do you think
we're close to rekindling?

1422
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:20,508
I mean, it feels like it
to me...

1423
01:02:20,542 --> 01:02:22,910
Is it a deal or not?

1424
01:02:22,943 --> 01:02:25,479
It can help you find Ryder.

1425
01:02:25,513 --> 01:02:26,847
I'll do what I can.

1426
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,148
I don't have the passcode.

1427
01:02:28,182 --> 01:02:30,117
Just figure it out,
okay, stuntman?

1428
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:30,951
Just find Ryder.

1429
01:02:30,985 --> 01:02:32,820
I'm gonna need you
to sign an NDA.

1430
01:02:32,853 --> 01:02:34,121
As you know,
nothing in this industry...

1431
01:02:34,154 --> 01:02:35,923
I don't have time for an NDA.
I got to--

1432
01:02:35,956 --> 01:02:36,991
I'm late for karaoke.--

1433
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,269
Jean-Claude!

1434
01:02:51,071 --> 01:02:53,274
Ryder's phone. Where is it?

1435
01:03:00,381 --> 01:03:02,449
What am I doing?
What am I doing?

1436
01:03:04,018 --> 01:03:06,887
-You sad that he left town?
-Who?

1437
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,322
-Colt.
-No, he didn't.

1438
01:03:08,355 --> 01:03:10,558
He's coming here. He's swinging
by to sing some karaoke.

1439
01:03:10,592 --> 01:03:12,293
Jody. No.

1440
01:03:12,326 --> 01:03:14,795
I... I gave him the tickets.

1441
01:03:16,964 --> 01:03:19,333
I see it! I see it!

1442
01:03:21,603 --> 01:03:24,038
Engage your core.

1443
01:03:39,153 --> 01:03:41,255
I need him to finish the movie.

1444
01:03:41,288 --> 01:03:44,291
Why would-- why wouldn't you
talk to me about it?

1445
01:03:50,497 --> 01:03:52,099
Give me that.

1446
01:03:53,535 --> 01:03:54,935
Fine.

1447
01:03:54,968 --> 01:03:56,003
Call me chicken.

1448
01:03:56,036 --> 01:03:57,438
Huh?

1449
01:03:57,471 --> 01:03:59,273
All right. Okay, tough guy.

1450
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,019
Okay, Jean-Claude.

1451
01:04:12,052 --> 01:04:14,021
I'll buy you a drink
when this is over.

1452
01:04:14,054 --> 01:04:16,390
<i>Attaque!</i>

1453
01:04:17,491 --> 01:04:19,226
Get away! Help! Help!

1454
01:04:19,259 --> 01:04:21,929
You've been so distracted.
You should have spoken to me.

1455
01:04:21,962 --> 01:04:23,197
This crossed wires-- Excuse me.

1456
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:24,898
Can I get another, please?
Thank you.

1457
01:04:28,168 --> 01:04:29,136
God!

1458
01:04:29,169 --> 01:04:32,072
Get me out!

1459
01:04:39,012 --> 01:04:42,517
Stay back! Stay back!
Stay back! Stay back!

1460
01:04:49,423 --> 01:04:52,426
I thought you wanted me
to get rid of him.

1461
01:04:53,595 --> 01:04:55,162
And he just left?

1462
01:04:57,164 --> 01:04:59,266
Gonna need a hand out here.

1463
01:05:00,234 --> 01:05:02,136
Who are you working for?!
Where's Ryder?!

1464
01:05:02,169 --> 01:05:03,505
-I don't know! I don't know!
-Tell me where he is!

1465
01:05:03,538 --> 01:05:05,139
Oh.

1466
01:05:12,045 --> 01:05:13,681
Where's the phone, stuntman?

1467
01:05:13,715 --> 01:05:15,983
I need that video!

1468
01:05:16,016 --> 01:05:17,619

01:05:31,365 --> 01:05:33,133
It's fine. It's fine.

1474
01:05:33,167 --> 01:05:35,369
-But you know what?
-He can do whatever he wants.

1475
01:05:35,402 --> 01:05:38,105
He's an adult human male,
and he should do as he pleases.

1476
01:05:38,138 --> 01:05:39,473
-He should just...
-Right. Yeah, he is.

1477
01:05:39,507 --> 01:05:41,108
...you know,
go his own way, you know?

1478
01:05:41,141 --> 01:05:42,744

y-you can focus up now.

-All I know is

1556
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:17,618
some really bad guys
are trying to get it.

1557
01:10:17,652 --> 01:10:19,020
Are you serious? What?

1558
01:10:19,053 --> 01:10:21,421
I just got to figure out
what's on there.

1559
01:10:22,389 --> 01:10:24,659
Then find Ryder and get him
to finish Jody's movie.

1560
01:10:24,692 --> 01:10:26,594
Okay. Well, shit, yeah.

1561
01:10:26,627 --> 01:10:28,428
Venti, she's like a tech genius
at this stuff.

1562
01:10:28,462 --> 01:10:30,031
Thank you!

1563
01:10:30,064 --> 01:10:31,364
Hey, Venti!

1564
01:10:31,398 --> 01:10:33,034
-Ventilicious.
-Hey.

1565
01:10:33,067 --> 01:10:35,002
What's poppin' on, boys?

1566
01:10:35,036 --> 01:10:38,371
Yeah, Ventinator.

1567
01:10:38,405 --> 01:10:40,641
You know how
to get into this thing?

1568
01:10:41,642 --> 01:10:44,311
Oh, I've seen
some of these guys.

1569
01:10:44,344 --> 01:10:46,346
This thing is a vault.

1570
01:10:46,379 --> 01:10:48,315
It'll take me like two or
three days to crack this thing.

1571
01:10:48,348 --> 01:10:49,984
Yeah, but you're like
a tech genius, you know?

1572
01:10:50,017 --> 01:10:51,619
What if you don't have
three days?

1573
01:10:51,652 --> 01:10:53,020
You need the password.
I'm telling you that.

1574
01:10:53,054 --> 01:10:55,355
You're next.

1575
01:10:55,388 --> 01:10:57,324
Nigel. Nigel!

1576
01:10:58,793 --> 01:11:00,895
Knowing Ryder, it's...

1577
01:11:00,928 --> 01:11:03,731
written on a Post-it note
in his apartment somewhere.

1578
01:11:03,765 --> 01:11:05,465
Okay.

1579
01:11:05,499 --> 01:11:07,769
Okay, next up, we've got Dan.

1580
01:11:07,802 --> 01:11:09,771
Come on, buddy. Come on, Dan.

1581
01:11:09,804 --> 01:11:11,338
Don't be shy, mate.

1582
01:11:11,371 --> 01:11:13,541
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

1583
01:11:13,574 --> 01:11:14,776
You owe me!

1584
01:11:19,647 --> 01:11:21,649
It's got
to be around here somewhere.

1585
01:11:21,682 --> 01:11:23,684
-Mm-hmm. -Let's just split up.
Jean-Claude...

1586
01:11:41,836 --> 01:11:43,571
Hello.

1587
01:11:54,048 --> 01:11:55,716
Oh.

1588
01:11:56,617 --> 01:11:59,887
You know what? I deserve this.

1589
01:12:02,123 --> 01:12:03,658
Idiot.

1590
01:12:05,993 --> 01:12:07,494
Colt?

1591
01:12:07,528 --> 01:12:10,064
Colt! I got it! Colt!

1592
01:12:10,097 --> 01:12:11,464
To finishing the movie.

1593
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:13,466
I think I got it.

1594
01:12:14,401 --> 01:12:15,837
All right.

1595
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:17,572
That guy mentioned a video.

1596
01:12:17,605 --> 01:12:20,440
Oh, baby, I'm here at work,

1597
01:12:20,473 --> 01:12:22,743
but I got a little something
for you, a little surprise.

1598
01:12:22,777 --> 01:12:24,645
It's just above my ass. Eh?

1599
01:12:24,679 --> 01:12:26,581
Oh, my God. Cover your eyes.

1600
01:12:26,614 --> 01:12:28,916
I think I've seen Tom's ass
more than my own.

1601
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:30,084
Okay.

1602
01:12:30,117 --> 01:12:32,687
Now is the winter
of our discontent

1603
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:35,156
Made glorious summer
by this sun of York...

1604
01:12:35,189 --> 01:12:36,724
He's such a dick.

1605
01:12:36,757 --> 01:12:38,693
But, God, he's good.

1606
01:12:38,726 --> 01:12:40,393
Yeah.

1607
01:12:41,028 --> 01:12:42,429
What about this?

1608
01:12:44,765 --> 01:12:47,602
Oh, here's that party his
assistant was talking about.

1609
01:12:48,501 --> 01:12:50,104
Iggy.

1610
01:12:50,137 --> 01:12:52,506
That's Henry.
That's Ryder's stunt double.

1611
01:12:54,542 --> 01:12:56,777
He looks a lot like the guy
I saw at the hotel.

1612
01:12:58,646 --> 01:13:01,916
When you were high?
And you were seeing unicorns?

1613
01:13:01,949 --> 01:13:04,151
And a dead guy on ice.

1614
01:13:09,456 --> 01:13:11,792
Hell yeah! Come on!

1615
01:13:11,826 --> 01:13:13,628
What?! What?!

1616
01:13:13,661 --> 01:13:15,796
Do I do my own stunts?

1617
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:17,031
I think I do.

1618
01:13:17,064 --> 01:13:19,100
I think I freakin' do.

1619
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:20,768
Yeah, baby.

1620
01:13:29,677 --> 01:13:31,045
Uh, gimme, gimme,
gimme, gimme...

1621
01:13:31,078 --> 01:13:32,479
Gimme the phone.
Gimme the phone.

1622
01:13:35,216 --> 01:13:37,752
-Oh, shit.
-Did they just kill Henry?

1623
01:13:47,228 --> 01:13:49,563
They just killed Henry.

1624
01:13:49,597 --> 01:13:51,732
Oh, it's Venti.

1625
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,035
-Hey, uh... Hello?
-Dan.

1626
01:13:54,068 --> 01:13:56,469
Turn on the news right now.

1627
01:13:57,171 --> 01:13:59,206
I can't believe this!

1628
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:02,510
The dead body discovered this
morning at the Pendleton Hotel

1629
01:14:02,543 --> 01:14:04,912
has been identified
as Henry Herrera,

1630
01:14:04,946 --> 01:14:08,082
an American stuntman known for
doubling superstar Tom Ryder.

1631
01:14:08,115 --> 01:14:11,218
Authorities are investigating
his death as a murder.

1632
01:14:11,252 --> 01:14:13,087
Their prime suspect
is another stuntman,

1633
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,623
Colt Seavers, who was
last seen in the hotel room

1634
01:14:15,656 --> 01:14:18,526
where Herrera's body
was discovered.

1635
01:14:18,559 --> 01:14:20,962
Police have released
this security footage

1636
01:14:20,995 --> 01:14:23,864
showing Seavers leaving
the scene of the crime.

1637
01:14:23,898 --> 01:14:26,167
If you have any information,
please do us a favor,

1638
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:29,103
reach out to Crime Stoppers
by the number on your screen.

1639
01:14:29,136 --> 01:14:32,472
And we'll have more on that
later. In the meantime...

1640
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:37,712
I got to call Jody.

1641
01:14:37,745 --> 01:14:39,847
It's high noon

1642
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,683
at the edge of
the universe, folks.

1643
01:14:43,651 --> 01:14:44,719
Which one was that?

1644
01:14:44,752 --> 01:14:45,987
That was take four.

1645
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:47,688
Goddamn it, Jody.

1646
01:14:47,722 --> 01:14:49,256
I mean, it looks like
frickin' Burning Man.

1647
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:52,126
My balls are drenched.
I need a towel.

1648
01:14:54,895 --> 01:14:57,865
This dude always forgets
that he's mic'd.

1649
01:14:57,898 --> 01:14:59,900
-I know.
-He says the craziest shit.

1650
01:14:59,934 --> 01:15:02,269
Craziest shit. I know, I know.

1651
01:15:02,303 --> 01:15:04,271
What, is it on airplane mode?

1652
01:15:04,305 --> 01:15:06,607
If this was <i>The Fugitive</i>

1653
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:09,877
and you were Harrison Ford...

1654
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:12,613
the bad guys would be
closing in.

1655
01:15:14,348 --> 01:15:15,750
I call tomahawk.

1656
01:15:15,783 --> 01:15:17,251
-Damn it.
-You stay alive.

1657
01:15:17,284 --> 01:15:18,753
Stay alive.

1658
01:15:18,786 --> 01:15:20,688
No matter how long it takes.

1659
01:15:20,721 --> 01:15:23,257
No matter how far, I will

1660
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:25,659
find you!

1661
01:15:25,693 --> 01:15:27,895
<i>-Last of the Mohicans.</i>
-Ah,

1662
01:15:27,928 --> 01:15:29,296
boy! Stunts!

1663
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:32,099
Damn it.

1664
01:15:43,677 --> 01:15:46,147
Shit, is this rubber? Oh, God.

1665
01:16:01,128 --> 01:16:03,230
Daniel Day-Lewis!

1666
01:16:18,345 --> 01:16:20,281
Jason Bourne!

1667
01:16:36,097 --> 01:16:37,865
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson!

1668
01:16:38,899 --> 01:16:41,102
Give me the phone!

1669
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:47,741
Where's the phone, stuntman?

1670
01:16:47,775 --> 01:16:49,677
We got to get this phone
to the cops.

1671
01:16:49,710 --> 01:16:51,645
-Okay.
-It's the only thing--

1672
01:17:19,173 --> 01:17:20,407
Hey, man bun!

1673
01:17:20,441 --> 01:17:22,443
Where's the phone, stuntman?

1674
01:17:22,476 --> 01:17:26,046
Jean-Claude, <i>attaque!</i>

1675
01:17:36,223 --> 01:17:37,391
I'm gonna take that.

1676
01:17:37,424 --> 01:17:39,093
Be careful of that, big fella.

1677
01:17:39,126 --> 01:17:40,861
Shut up!

1678
01:17:41,862 --> 01:17:43,464
I'm gonna go out the front
and make sure no one's there.

1679
01:17:43,497 --> 01:17:44,865
-Okay.
-All right.

1680
01:17:44,899 --> 01:17:45,900
Hey, take Jean-Claude,
would you?

1681
01:17:45,933 --> 01:17:48,202
Okay. <i>Allons-y!</i>

1682
01:17:50,271 --> 01:17:53,174
Just you and me, stuntman.

1683
01:17:53,207 --> 01:17:55,009
Shit.

1684
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:07,788
Colt's down.

1685
01:18:07,821 --> 01:18:11,058
Big fella got away, though.

1686
01:18:11,091 --> 01:18:12,960
Uh-huh.

1687
01:18:19,433 --> 01:18:20,901
You can make it.

1688
01:18:20,935 --> 01:18:22,870
You can make it. You can
make it. You can make it!

1689
01:18:23,504 --> 01:18:25,739
No! It's too dangerous!

1690
01:18:25,773 --> 01:18:27,341
Got to be stairs.

1691
01:18:27,374 --> 01:18:29,843
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

1692
01:18:45,226 --> 01:18:47,261
Colt. Hey, man.

1693
01:18:51,031 --> 01:18:55,169
Look at that.
Yeah, makin' a movie here.

1694
01:18:56,003 --> 01:18:58,038
Could you leave us, please?

1695
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:00,808
Yeah.

1696
01:19:02,843 --> 01:19:05,746
Ooh, Gail. So tense.

1697
01:19:06,480 --> 01:19:08,516
You remember old Dressy, right?

1698
01:19:10,818 --> 01:19:12,019
Stuntman.

1699
01:19:12,052 --> 01:19:14,855
I never forget a fist.

1700
01:19:15,856 --> 01:19:18,058
Listen, I'm gonna need
the phone. Where is it?

1701
01:19:18,092 --> 01:19:20,761
It's a matter of urgency.
I need to know.

1702
01:19:22,062 --> 01:19:25,466
Right. The one that proves
that you killed Henry, not me.

1703
01:19:25,499 --> 01:19:26,867
-Eh...
-That phone.

1704
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,002
-Well...
-Yeah.

1705
01:19:28,035 --> 01:19:29,537
I'm gonna hold on to that.

1706
01:19:29,571 --> 01:19:32,072
Seems like it's the only thing
keeping me alive right now.

1707
01:19:32,106 --> 01:19:33,941
What?

1708
01:19:33,974 --> 01:19:36,544
He's the prime suspect, Jody.

1709
01:19:36,578 --> 01:19:39,547
Gail, come on.
Are you kidding me?

1710
01:19:39,581 --> 01:19:41,015
-I know.
-Colt?

1711
01:19:41,048 --> 01:19:42,149
-Yeah.
-There's no way.

1712
01:19:42,182 --> 01:19:43,350
-That's what I said.
-There's no way!

1713
01:19:43,384 --> 01:19:44,586
What went wrong?

1714
01:19:44,619 --> 01:19:46,554
-What went wrong?
-Mmm.

1715
01:19:46,588 --> 01:19:48,556
What went wrong?
Well, as I look at it,

1716
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:50,291
you know, you're--
you're torturing me

1717
01:19:50,324 --> 01:19:52,493
right outside your superyacht
like a Bond villain.

1718
01:19:52,527 --> 01:19:53,528
Dipshit!

1719
01:19:53,561 --> 01:19:55,396
What went wrong?

1720
01:19:56,363 --> 01:19:58,799
What went right?!

1721
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:03,304
You changed.

1722
01:20:03,337 --> 01:20:05,906
You changed.

1723
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:10,344
Yeah. We used to be
like brothers, you and I.

1724
01:20:10,377 --> 01:20:13,615
Entered into the sacred bond
of actor and stuntman, man.

1725
01:20:13,648 --> 01:20:15,316
-Oh, God.
-Yeah.

1726
01:20:15,349 --> 01:20:17,151
You think Colt could murder
a human being?

1727
01:20:17,184 --> 01:20:18,919
-No, I don't.
-Did you tell them that?

1728
01:20:18,952 --> 01:20:20,120
-I said that.
-This is a man--

1729
01:20:20,154 --> 01:20:21,589
This is a man
who spent 23 minutes

1730
01:20:21,623 --> 01:20:23,190
ushering a cockroach
out of my room once,

1731
01:20:23,223 --> 01:20:24,592
and I was like, "Just stomp
on it," and he was like,

1732
01:20:24,626 --> 01:20:26,460
"No, let it live."
I mean, it's Colt.

1733
01:20:26,493 --> 01:20:28,062
I told them all of that.

1734
01:20:28,095 --> 01:20:30,632
I told him who he is--
who I thought he was.

1735
01:20:30,665 --> 01:20:32,066
Did you, emphatically?

1736
01:20:32,099 --> 01:20:33,601
-Yes, I did.
-Yeah, because he

1737
01:20:33,635 --> 01:20:35,570
was at the airport
where you sent him.

1738
01:20:35,603 --> 01:20:37,304
He never got on the plane, Jody.

1739
01:20:37,338 --> 01:20:39,039
-How many movies have we done?
-Oh, I don't know.

1740
01:20:39,073 --> 01:20:40,642
How many? Yeah, too many
to count, that's right.

1741
01:20:40,675 --> 01:20:42,876
-Yeah. -'Cause I put you
in the contract, didn't I?

1742
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:44,345
I put you there, right there.

1743
01:20:44,378 --> 01:20:45,979
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah? That's right,

1744
01:20:46,013 --> 01:20:47,381
-I had the assistant,
the makeup and hair... -Right.

1745
01:20:47,414 --> 01:20:48,949
...uh, trainer, and then boom,

1746
01:20:48,982 --> 01:20:51,118
Ryder's number one stuntman,
Colt Seavers.

1747
01:20:51,151 --> 01:20:53,287
That was me, I did that.
I did that for you.

1748
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,956
What are you gonna
do for me? Huh?

1749
01:20:55,989 --> 01:20:58,325
Die, I guess?

1750
01:20:58,359 --> 01:20:59,893
Right? Die?

1751
01:20:59,927 --> 01:21:01,228
-Is that the plan?
-It's nothing personal.

1752
01:21:01,261 --> 01:21:02,930
Oh, my God.
Well, I'm taking it personal.

1753
01:21:02,963 --> 01:21:04,164
-Yeah, I can see that.
-The torture.

1754
01:21:04,198 --> 01:21:05,966
You know what?
It's just business.

1755
01:21:05,999 --> 01:21:07,301
-The drugging, the Taser.
-You know, it's just business.

1756
01:21:07,334 --> 01:21:08,969
I mean, Tom Ryder's
a global brand.

1757
01:21:09,002 --> 01:21:10,437
-I'm taking it personal.
-I literally move markets.

1758
01:21:10,471 --> 01:21:13,508
If I go down...
the freakin' Dow goes down.

1759
01:21:13,541 --> 01:21:17,978
If you break your back,
I replace you like this. Boom.

1760
01:21:18,011 --> 01:21:19,947
You know, if you'd just
stuck to your job

1761
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:22,015
instead of trying to
hog the spotlight,

1762
01:21:22,049 --> 01:21:23,917
this wouldn't have happened.
I mean, Henry wouldn't be

1763
01:21:23,951 --> 01:21:25,986
on the scene, his accident
wouldn't have happened,

1764
01:21:26,019 --> 01:21:28,389
your accident...
freaky little fall.

1765
01:21:28,422 --> 01:21:30,391
'Cause you just
push my buttons, man.

1766
01:21:30,424 --> 01:21:31,526
Wait a second. What?

1767
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:35,496
What?

1768
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:37,699
What did you say
about my accident?

1769
01:21:37,732 --> 01:21:39,466
Well, you know,
you pushed me over the edge.

1770
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,636
You literally pushed a button.
I mean, you didn't--

1771
01:21:41,669 --> 01:21:44,304
<i>I mean, I pushed the button.</i>

1772
01:21:47,575 --> 01:21:50,444
<i>I had to crank it up a notch.</i>

1773
01:21:57,317 --> 01:21:58,553
That was you?

1774
01:21:58,586 --> 01:22:00,320
Yeah.

1775
01:22:03,457 --> 01:22:05,560
Had to teach you
a little lesson, didn't I?

1776
01:22:05,593 --> 01:22:07,729
Got a little
too big for your boots,

1777
01:22:07,762 --> 01:22:09,263
didn't you?

1778
01:22:09,296 --> 01:22:10,698
Henry's no different, you know.

1779
01:22:12,199 --> 01:22:15,436
Hey. You do your own stunts?

1780
01:22:15,469 --> 01:22:17,037
Do I do my own stunts?

1781
01:22:17,070 --> 01:22:19,440
In front of all those people,
that's humiliating.

1782
01:22:19,473 --> 01:22:22,009
And yeah, I'm gonna
kick you into next week.

1783
01:22:24,011 --> 01:22:26,581
But then Gail, you know...

1784
01:22:26,614 --> 01:22:29,216
-Remember Gail, right?
-I've known her for 15 years.

1785
01:22:29,249 --> 01:22:31,051
Oh, yeah. I forget, 'cause
you've been out of the game

1786
01:22:31,084 --> 01:22:32,419
-so long, you know?
-I introduced the two of you.

1787
01:22:32,453 --> 01:22:34,087
Calls me up and says,
"It doesn't look good."

1788
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:36,624
Bad for marketing and renting,

1789
01:22:36,658 --> 01:22:38,760
and blah, blah, blah,
and murder and...

1790
01:22:38,793 --> 01:22:41,061
I know, I-I-I d--

1791
01:22:41,094 --> 01:22:44,732
I real-- I really
don't need this right now.

1792
01:22:44,766 --> 01:22:46,734
Fucking Henry!

1793
01:22:46,768 --> 01:22:48,770
Don't worry about it.

1794
01:22:48,803 --> 01:22:51,138
You lay low...

1795
01:22:51,171 --> 01:22:53,073
and I will handle everything.

1796
01:22:54,141 --> 01:22:57,211
Maybe we don't know people
as well as we think we do.

1797
01:22:57,244 --> 01:23:00,013
-Oh, my God.
-You know?

1798
01:23:00,648 --> 01:23:01,683
Oh, my God, it's Colt.

1799
01:23:01,716 --> 01:23:03,183
-Give me the phone.
-No.

1800
01:23:03,217 --> 01:23:04,619
-What are you doing?
-Gail, get off the pho--

1801
01:23:04,652 --> 01:23:06,253
-Oh! What are you doing?
-Oh, my-- Jesus Christ, Gail!

1802
01:23:06,286 --> 01:23:08,723
-Oh, my-- Oh, I'm so sorry.
-Oh, my God.

1803
01:23:08,756 --> 01:23:10,224
-Let me help you.
-No, stop it.

1804
01:23:10,257 --> 01:23:11,358
-Let me take it up to--
-Do you know what?

1805
01:23:11,391 --> 01:23:12,627
-Just give me a minute.
-Yep.

1806
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:13,695
Just give me a minute.

1807
01:23:13,728 --> 01:23:16,230
-Yep.
-Come on.

1808
01:23:16,831 --> 01:23:19,199
This plan was so simple.

1809
01:23:19,233 --> 01:23:21,636
Yeah, we were gonna put
Henry's body on ice

1810
01:23:21,669 --> 01:23:23,303
so it doesn't decompose.

1811
01:23:23,337 --> 01:23:26,106
We could pull you out from
that rock you crawled under.

1812
01:23:26,139 --> 01:23:28,275
-My life, yep.
-You know, scan your face.

1813
01:23:29,677 --> 01:23:32,079
Dressy here is gonna stick you
on the murder video.

1814
01:23:32,112 --> 01:23:33,515
Drug you, drive you
and Henry's body

1815
01:23:33,548 --> 01:23:36,651
off the Sydney Harbour Bridge,
in your car-- boom.

1816
01:23:36,684 --> 01:23:39,052
You got murder, suicide.

1817
01:23:39,086 --> 01:23:40,522
Cut. Check the gate.

1818
01:23:40,555 --> 01:23:42,122
Move on. Beautiful.

1819
01:23:42,155 --> 01:23:44,124
I think we have different ideas
of what simple is.

1820
01:23:44,157 --> 01:23:45,492
Y-You just didn't
stay down, did you?

1821
01:23:45,527 --> 01:23:47,562
You had to, like, uh,
create a big scene,

1822
01:23:47,595 --> 01:23:49,229
like Colt Seavers does.

1823
01:23:49,263 --> 01:23:51,365
You could-- But you know what?
This can still work

1824
01:23:51,398 --> 01:23:55,135
because we got the murder,
now we just need the suicide.

1825
01:23:58,171 --> 01:24:00,140
-Sad.
-It's plot heavy.

1826
01:24:00,173 --> 01:24:02,142
We're getting tangled
in exposition.

1827
01:24:02,175 --> 01:24:03,811
Lose the last part--
the suicide.

1828
01:24:03,845 --> 01:24:05,780
You lose the audience
if there's too much.

1829
01:24:05,813 --> 01:24:07,414
Colt.

1830
01:24:07,447 --> 01:24:08,550
Where's the phone?

1831
01:24:08,583 --> 01:24:11,753
Tom, you need carbs!

1832
01:24:11,786 --> 01:24:15,122
Your brain runs on glucose!

1833
01:24:15,155 --> 01:24:17,592
For simple cognitive functions.

1834
01:24:17,625 --> 01:24:20,260
-You need them.
-Colt, you're the fall guy.

1835
01:24:20,294 --> 01:24:22,530
You're the fall guy, you know.

1836
01:24:22,564 --> 01:24:25,132
Where's the phone?

1837
01:24:25,165 --> 01:24:27,467
I mean, I-- You can keep
taking hits all night,

1838
01:24:27,501 --> 01:24:28,836
but you know what?

1839
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:30,705
I can think of a few
other people who can't.

1840
01:24:30,738 --> 01:24:34,408
We could bring Dan up here,
maybe Jody, perhaps.

1841
01:24:34,441 --> 01:24:36,578
I mean, I like Jody,
but you know.

1842
01:24:36,611 --> 01:24:38,780
There's no phone.

1843
01:24:38,813 --> 01:24:40,515
Okay? That's the twist.

1844
01:24:40,548 --> 01:24:41,783
No phone.

1845
01:24:41,816 --> 01:24:44,686
He shot it out of my hand.

1846
01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:46,253
Up there, go check.

1847
01:24:46,286 --> 01:24:48,590
You, too, all of you.
I'll wait.

1848
01:24:48,623 --> 01:24:51,358
-He shot it.
-You didn't know you did that?

1849
01:24:51,391 --> 01:24:54,127
It's crazy. I've been wanting
to tell you this whole time.

1850
01:24:54,161 --> 01:24:55,329
No, he didn't.

1851
01:24:55,362 --> 01:24:57,364
-I was by the door frame.
-No.

1852
01:24:57,397 --> 01:24:59,634
And he shoots it
out of my hands!

1853
01:24:59,667 --> 01:25:01,201
-No.
-Take the ties off.

1854
01:25:01,234 --> 01:25:02,737
-Oh, my God, what a relief.
-That's crazy.

1855
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:05,238
You were right about one thing,
that was the only thing

1856
01:25:05,272 --> 01:25:08,610
keeping you alive.

1857
01:25:08,643 --> 01:25:10,277
I really wish you could see

1858
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:11,713
what Jody's gonna do
with <i>Metalstorm.</i>

1859
01:25:11,746 --> 01:25:13,213
It's gonna be awesome.

1860
01:25:13,246 --> 01:25:17,217
And honestly...
it's gonna be a banger.

1861
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:20,220
Not so cocky now,
are you, mate?

1862
01:25:20,253 --> 01:25:22,657
Jesus, Mike Mike,
put a lid on it.

1863
01:25:26,928 --> 01:25:29,162
Wish you didn't
break that bond, bro.

1864
01:25:29,196 --> 01:25:30,531
Wish you didn't break that bond.

1865
01:25:30,565 --> 01:25:32,934
All right, stuntman,
time for a drink, mate. Eh?

1866
01:25:32,967 --> 01:25:36,336
There we go. Eh?

1867
01:25:36,370 --> 01:25:37,772
Help!

1868
01:25:37,805 --> 01:25:39,641
Help!

1869
01:25:39,674 --> 01:25:41,509
-Shut up. Shut up.
-Help!

1870
01:25:41,542 --> 01:25:43,511
Shut up, mate.

1871
01:25:51,819 --> 01:25:53,320
There.

1872
01:25:53,353 --> 01:25:55,188
This fire gag's real.

1873
01:26:09,503 --> 01:26:10,972
Come on, guys, start the boat.

1874
01:26:11,005 --> 01:26:12,573
He's gone the wrong way.

1875
01:26:24,886 --> 01:26:26,521
Shit!

1876
01:27:37,825 --> 01:27:39,694
Oh, Colt.

1877
01:27:39,727 --> 01:27:40,762
Colt?

1878
01:27:40,795 --> 01:27:41,996
-Hey.
-What's going on?

1879
01:27:42,029 --> 01:27:43,030
What'd you sing?

1880
01:27:43,064 --> 01:27:44,766
-What?
-At karaoke.

1881
01:27:44,799 --> 01:27:46,366
-I'm sorry I didn't make it.
-It doesn't matter.

1882
01:27:46,399 --> 01:27:47,769
Listen. Everyone's saying
you killed Henry.

1883
01:27:47,802 --> 01:27:49,537
-What's happening?
-Oh, that's not true.

1884
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,038
You're gonna hear a lot
of things that aren't true.

1885
01:27:51,072 --> 01:27:53,775
I just wanted to say that
when I first got here,

1886
01:27:53,808 --> 01:27:55,810
when you asked how I was doing
and I gave you the thumbs-up,

1887
01:27:55,843 --> 01:27:57,545
when you were like,
"That's stunt guy bullshit,"

1888
01:27:57,578 --> 01:27:59,714
and you're right,
it's total cliché,

1889
01:27:59,747 --> 01:28:01,749
but, you know,
there's a reason you don't see

1890
01:28:01,783 --> 01:28:03,584
the thumbs-down stunt guy.

1891
01:28:05,385 --> 01:28:07,989
You know, it's kind of part
of our training.

1892
01:28:08,022 --> 01:28:10,525
Right? You know,
you get hit by a car,

1893
01:28:10,558 --> 01:28:11,859
you get thrown out of a window,

1894
01:28:11,893 --> 01:28:13,961
you get set on fire,
you give the thumbs-up.

1895
01:28:13,995 --> 01:28:16,463
But, uh, after my accident--

1896
01:28:16,496 --> 01:28:20,635
turns out was not an accident,
by the way--

1897
01:28:20,668 --> 01:28:23,403
I, uh...

1898
01:28:23,436 --> 01:28:25,438
I wasn't okay.

1899
01:28:26,073 --> 01:28:28,509
And not because I broke my back,

1900
01:28:28,543 --> 01:28:32,046
because I just felt
like a huge...

1901
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:33,915
failure.

1902
01:28:36,951 --> 01:28:38,953
And I realized that, uh...

1903
01:28:38,986 --> 01:28:41,622
you know, I'm not invincible.

1904
01:28:41,656 --> 01:28:43,456
Huge shocker.

1905
01:28:44,424 --> 01:28:47,094
And I thought maybe
I wasn't so special

1906
01:28:47,128 --> 01:28:48,796
or something, so I, uh...

1907
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:51,532
just figured that
the thumbs-down version of me

1908
01:28:51,566 --> 01:28:54,434
wasn't what you got
into it for, so I disappeared.

1909
01:28:54,467 --> 01:28:56,904
But, you know, I didn't
just disappear on you.

1910
01:28:56,938 --> 01:29:00,107
Uh... just disappeared on,

1911
01:29:00,141 --> 01:29:04,779
on, uh, myself... too.

1912
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:08,115
Anyway, I'm sorry.

1913
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:10,117
You deserved more than that.
I'm sorry.

1914
01:29:10,151 --> 01:29:12,653
I just wanted you to be honest.

1915
01:29:13,554 --> 01:29:16,958
You know, honestly,
it, uh, all hurts.

1916
01:29:22,196 --> 01:29:24,632
Getting hit by a car hurts.

1917
01:29:24,665 --> 01:29:26,634
Getting thrown out
of a window hurts.

1918
01:29:26,667 --> 01:29:30,872
Getting set on fire
really hurts.

1919
01:29:30,905 --> 01:29:34,008
But, uh...

1920
01:29:37,044 --> 01:29:39,780
...none of it ever hurt as much
as not being with you.

1921
01:29:42,116 --> 01:29:43,918
Where are you?

1922
01:29:45,219 --> 01:29:48,488
Is that from a movie
or did I just make that up?

1923
01:29:48,522 --> 01:29:49,957
It's pretty good.

1924
01:29:49,991 --> 01:29:51,792
-There he is!
-You can use it if you want.

1925
01:29:55,162 --> 01:29:56,697
No, please...

1926
01:29:56,731 --> 01:29:58,900
For what it's worth,
I'm still in love with you.

1927
01:30:00,101 --> 01:30:02,770
And I don't think you should
give up on that happy ending.

1928
01:30:02,803 --> 01:30:03,905
Colt.

1929
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,641

Jody, you need
to be quiet. Don't say a word.

1983
01:34:11,252 --> 01:34:12,987
Wait, wait. No.

Wait!

It's me. It's me.

01:34:52,493 --> 01:34:54,261
Remember?

1989
01:34:54,295 --> 01:34:56,497
Jesus Christ.

1990
01:34:56,531 --> 01:34:58,199
I knew it.

1991
01:34:58,232 --> 01:34:59,266
I knew it.

1992
01:35:00,467 --> 01:35:02,469
I knew you were alive.

1993
01:35:02,503 --> 01:35:03,737
Three shows a day,

1994
01:35:03,771 --> 01:35:04,805
six days a week for three years.

1995
01:35:04,838 --> 01:35:06,874
The <i>Miami Vice</i> stunt show.

1996
01:35:08,142 --> 01:35:09,376
You remembered.

1997
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:12,246
Yes.
I'm happy you're alive, Colt.

1998
01:35:12,279 --> 01:35:14,215
Colt, I'm so happy you're alive.

1999
01:35:14,248 --> 01:35:15,749
-I knew it.
-Oh, my God.

2000
01:35:15,783 --> 01:35:17,284
-What were you doing...
-Nice work with the pen.

2001
01:35:17,318 --> 01:35:18,886
-So sorry. -No, it was great.
You got it out just in time.

2002
01:35:18,919 --> 01:35:20,487
I think the ink poisoning
didn't set in.

2003
01:35:20,522 --> 01:35:22,957
-Chef's kiss.
-What's going on?

2004
01:35:22,990 --> 01:35:24,892
-Huh? -Everyone's saying
that you killed Henry.

2005
01:35:24,925 --> 01:35:27,161
Ryder killed Henry.
He framed me.

2006
01:35:27,194 --> 01:35:28,362
There's footage of you.

2007
01:35:28,395 --> 01:35:30,130
-Well, he deepfaked me.
-What?

2008
01:35:30,164 --> 01:35:32,166
They do it all the time
on the Internet.

2009
01:35:32,199 --> 01:35:34,935
They take Tom Cruise's face,
and they put it on yours.

2010
01:35:34,969 --> 01:35:36,370
And you can't tell
the difference.

2011
01:35:36,403 --> 01:35:37,838
No. Okay, so where's
the real footage

2012
01:35:37,871 --> 01:35:39,440
of Ryder killing Henry?
How do we get it?

2013
01:35:39,473 --> 01:35:41,375
It was on Ryder's phone, and
then it got destroyed because

2014
01:35:41,408 --> 01:35:43,511
-Dan's <i>Last of the Mohicans</i>
plan didn't work out. -What?

2015
01:35:43,545 --> 01:35:46,780
It's not his fault, you know?
He called tomahawk first, okay.

2016
01:35:46,814 --> 01:35:48,015
I got "blanks only."

2017
01:35:48,048 --> 01:35:49,350
And it was going
pretty well, actually,

2018
01:35:49,383 --> 01:35:51,085
and then Dressler showed up.

2019
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:53,988
So he, you know, he does this,
like, Jason Bourne shit.

2020
01:35:54,021 --> 01:35:56,524
Okay, I have so many questions.

2021
01:35:56,558 --> 01:35:58,025
Okay.

2022
01:35:58,058 --> 01:36:00,194
Who else knows you're alive?

2023
01:36:00,227 --> 01:36:01,862
-No one.
-Great.

2024
01:36:01,895 --> 01:36:03,297
No, that's the point.
I mean, I figure

2025
01:36:03,330 --> 01:36:04,798
we can't finish the movie
unless they think I'm dead.

2026
01:36:04,832 --> 01:36:06,400
What movie?

2027
01:36:06,433 --> 01:36:07,401
<i>Metalstorm.</i>

2028
01:36:07,434 --> 01:36:09,103
What about <i>Metalstorm?</i>

2029
01:36:09,136 --> 01:36:10,538
If they think I'm dead,
they'll come back and finish.

2030
01:36:10,572 --> 01:36:11,839
-Who?
-Ryder.

2031
01:36:11,872 --> 01:36:13,440
-Finish what?
-The movie.

2032
01:36:13,474 --> 01:36:14,875
<i>-Metalstorm?</i>
-Exactly.

2033
01:36:14,908 --> 01:36:16,544
-Are you insane? You are insane.
-What?

2034
01:36:16,578 --> 01:36:18,045
You need to be
burning your fingerprints off,

2035
01:36:18,078 --> 01:36:19,313
and you need to be
getting across the border

2036
01:36:19,346 --> 01:36:20,981
as fast as possible.

2037
01:36:21,015 --> 01:36:23,183
We're gonna hide you
until we can clear your name.

2038
01:36:23,217 --> 01:36:25,152
None of it matters anymore.
It's just a stupid movie.

2039
01:36:25,185 --> 01:36:26,353
-What?
-It's a stupid movie.

2040
01:36:26,387 --> 01:36:27,855
Don't say that.

2041
01:36:27,888 --> 01:36:30,224
That's <i>Metalstorm</i>
you're talking about.

2042
01:36:30,257 --> 01:36:32,560
That's the movie you spent
your whole life trying to make.

2043
01:36:32,594 --> 01:36:34,194
Who knows?

2044
01:36:34,228 --> 01:36:36,196
You might inspire a whole
generation of little Jodys

2045
01:36:36,230 --> 01:36:39,933
to pick up cameras
and make their own movies.

2046
01:36:41,569 --> 01:36:43,571
You're just-- you're special.

2047
01:36:44,505 --> 01:36:47,007
And all of us get to be
a part of something special

2048
01:36:47,041 --> 01:36:49,176
because it comes from you.

2049
01:36:49,209 --> 01:36:52,580
I obviously failed
at getting us our happy ending,

2050
01:36:52,614 --> 01:36:54,248
but I'll be damned
if I'm gonna let

2051
01:36:54,281 --> 01:36:56,450
Space Cowboy and Aliena
not have theirs.

2052
01:37:02,890 --> 01:37:04,091
Jody, my love!

2053
01:37:04,124 --> 01:37:05,259
-One sec!
-I'm coming...

2054
01:37:05,292 --> 01:37:06,894
Stop it.

2055
01:37:06,927 --> 01:37:08,395
Gail. She's in on it.

2056
01:37:08,429 --> 01:37:10,030
-What?
-Yes.

2057
01:37:10,064 --> 01:37:11,533
-Okay, come on. -Let's just
kiss a little bit first.

2058
01:37:11,566 --> 01:37:13,934
No, come on, we g-- got to get
you in the bathroom, please.

2059
01:37:15,269 --> 01:37:16,437
Come on.

2060
01:37:18,172 --> 01:37:19,641
Come on.

2061
01:37:19,674 --> 01:37:22,343
Christ!

2062
01:37:22,376 --> 01:37:23,545
Got to work.

2063
01:37:23,578 --> 01:37:25,346
You all right in there,
my darling?

2064
01:37:25,379 --> 01:37:28,182
Here, this-- Take this soap
and rub it on my belly.

2065
01:37:29,950 --> 01:37:31,352
Get in the bedroom.

2066
01:37:31,385 --> 01:37:34,021
-Okay. Colt. Are you good? Okay.
-Okay. Yeah.

2067
01:37:34,054 --> 01:37:36,390
-Be quiet. Don't make a sound.
-Jod?

2068
01:37:36,423 --> 01:37:37,592
-My head. The head.
-What?

2069
01:37:40,127 --> 01:37:41,962
-Hi!
-Hey. Hello, you.

2070
01:37:41,995 --> 01:37:44,231
-Hey. Hey.
-Aw, come here.

2071
01:37:44,264 --> 01:37:45,366
Thank you.

2072
01:37:45,399 --> 01:37:46,967
Aw, how's my favorite director?

2073
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,402
Uh, a bit emotional, you know.

2074
01:37:48,435 --> 01:37:49,937
Oh, no-- Jesus.

2075
01:37:49,970 --> 01:37:51,338
Like Johnny and Amber
have just been here.

2076
01:37:51,372 --> 01:37:53,307
I just need to vent,
'cause it's been...

2077
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:56,110
-it's just been so much.
-I know. I know.

2078
01:37:56,143 --> 01:37:57,645
-I'm so sorry about Colt.
-Thank you.

2079
01:37:57,679 --> 01:38:00,314
You know, it's such a shame,
but what a mess.

2080
01:38:00,347 --> 01:38:01,549
-Right.
-Who knew?

2081
01:38:01,583 --> 01:38:03,317
-Yeah.
-I mean, I tried to help him.

2082
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:05,986
I hope you know that, but
sometimes you can't help people

2083
01:38:06,019 --> 01:38:07,421
-who don't want to be saved.
-Right.

2084
01:38:07,454 --> 01:38:09,691
But silver lining

2085
01:38:09,724 --> 01:38:12,926
to this very dark
cloud.

2086
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,629
I've got Ryder to come back.

2087
01:38:14,662 --> 01:38:16,230
-And I have a plan.
-Really?

2088
01:38:16,263 --> 01:38:18,232
But we're not
gonna be able to do

2089
01:38:18,265 --> 01:38:21,135
your big third act set piece,
the car jump.

2090
01:38:21,168 --> 01:38:24,405
It is an impossible jump,
especially now with Colt gone.

2091
01:38:24,438 --> 01:38:26,440
-Dead.
-He's gone.

2092
01:38:26,473 --> 01:38:28,576
-He's so dead.
-Stay with me.

2093
01:38:28,610 --> 01:38:30,110
I spoke to Venti.

2094
01:38:30,144 --> 01:38:32,212
She says that she can do it
in VFX.

2095
01:38:32,246 --> 01:38:33,147
The car jump.

2096
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:35,650
All we need to focus on
is Ryder's new,

2097
01:38:35,683 --> 01:38:39,319
final, bombastic monologue.

2098
01:38:39,353 --> 01:38:40,555
I've read the pages.

2099
01:38:40,588 --> 01:38:42,089
God, you smashed it.
I knew you would.

2100
01:38:42,122 --> 01:38:43,591
-We're gonna get him covered.
-Yeah.

2101
01:38:43,625 --> 01:38:46,226
You, meanwhile...

2102
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:48,962
please go and rest up in Fiji,
on me.

2103
01:38:48,996 --> 01:38:52,132
You know?
Plop yourself on a beach.

2104
01:38:52,166 --> 01:38:54,569
And I'm gonna take care
of all of it for you.

2105
01:38:54,602 --> 01:38:55,570
Gail.

2106
01:38:55,603 --> 01:38:57,137
You've got so much to process.

2107
01:38:57,171 --> 01:38:58,740
-No.
-I can take care of all of it.

2108
01:38:58,773 --> 01:39:01,442
No. This is my movie.

2109
01:39:01,475 --> 01:39:03,076
Now, listen to me.

2110
01:39:03,110 --> 01:39:04,411
I've learned so much from you.

2111
01:39:04,445 --> 01:39:07,181
-I know. Thank you.
-And I'm very grateful.

2112
01:39:07,214 --> 01:39:09,283
But the lesson I stand by now,

2113
01:39:09,316 --> 01:39:11,018
-that you've taught me...
-Yeah. Yeah.

2114
01:39:11,051 --> 01:39:14,589
You fall down,
you get right back up.

2115
01:39:17,625 --> 01:39:19,594
I am directing this movie, yeah.

2116
01:39:19,627 --> 01:39:21,094
Oh, my God, that's my girl.

2117
01:39:21,128 --> 01:39:23,063
-It went in. I'm so proud
of you. -Good. Okay.

2118
01:39:23,096 --> 01:39:24,566
Thank you. All right,
let's get you out of here.

2119
01:39:24,599 --> 01:39:26,300
-One last thing.
-Yeah?

2120
01:39:26,333 --> 01:39:28,068
-Have you seen Dan? -Nope.
I think he's by the taco truck.

2121
01:39:28,101 --> 01:39:29,369
-You haven't heard from him?
-He's probably-probably

2122
01:39:29,403 --> 01:39:30,705
over there somewhere.
Thank you so much.

2123
01:39:30,738 --> 01:39:32,272
-I'm proud of you.
-Thank you.

2124
01:39:32,306 --> 01:39:33,741
Thanks for the pep talk.
Okay, buh-bye.

2125
01:39:33,775 --> 01:39:35,142
-Love you, darling.
-Love you, too. Bye!

2126
01:39:35,175 --> 01:39:36,744
Oof.

2127
01:39:36,778 --> 01:39:38,278
You're gonna finish the movie.

2128
01:39:38,312 --> 01:39:41,048
No, I'm gonna clear your name.
Okay, now listen.

2129
01:39:41,081 --> 01:39:42,349
Why can't we do both?

2130
01:39:42,382 --> 01:39:43,050
I think we can.

2131
01:39:43,083 --> 01:39:45,085
We're gonna bring him to set,

2132
01:39:45,118 --> 01:39:48,121
in a controlled environment,
and then we surround him...

2133
01:39:48,155 --> 01:39:50,592
And we beat the shit out of him.

2134
01:39:50,625 --> 01:39:52,092
No.

2135
01:39:52,125 --> 01:39:53,795
We're gonna force
a confession out of him

2136
01:39:53,828 --> 01:39:55,797
by putting him in a scene.

2137
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:57,565
-Right. -You know,
he always forgets he's mic'd.

2138
01:39:57,599 --> 01:39:59,066
That's better.

2139
01:39:59,099 --> 01:40:00,501
I just don't know
how to do it yet.

2140
01:40:04,204 --> 01:40:06,039
I know how to do that.

2141
01:40:07,809 --> 01:40:10,110
Make him do his own stunt.

2142
01:40:10,143 --> 01:40:11,679
The impossible jump.

2143
01:40:11,713 --> 01:40:14,147
Then we beat the shit
out of him.

2144
01:40:14,181 --> 01:40:17,519
One seventy-four,
alpha, take two.

2145
01:40:20,387 --> 01:40:21,723
And action!

2146
01:40:21,756 --> 01:40:24,157
O-One second, one second,
one second.

2147
01:40:26,661 --> 01:40:28,428
Action!

2148
01:40:30,297 --> 01:40:31,465
It's high noon

2149
01:40:31,498 --> 01:40:33,568
at the edge of
the universe, folks.

2150
01:40:49,416 --> 01:40:52,587
Now, we're facing
a powerful enemy.

2151
01:40:53,721 --> 01:40:58,693
An alien species born of
the worst of humanity's traits.

2152
01:40:58,726 --> 01:41:01,863
Well, what our enemy doesn't see

2153
01:41:01,896 --> 01:41:05,600
is that their demise
is imminent.

2154
01:41:06,466 --> 01:41:11,573
And the most powerful weapon
in all galaxy?

2155
01:41:14,609 --> 01:41:16,578
Love.

2156
01:41:17,745 --> 01:41:24,619
Inside each and every
one of you is a spark, baby.

2157
01:41:24,652 --> 01:41:26,453
An ember.

2158
01:41:26,486 --> 01:41:28,723
A goddamn fire!

2159
01:41:32,627 --> 01:41:35,697
Love is how we will win.

2160
01:41:35,730 --> 01:41:38,165
And even if we lose,

2161
01:41:38,198 --> 01:41:41,836
we're gonna die
fighting for a happy ending!

2162
01:41:41,869 --> 01:41:45,339
Hell yeah!

2163
01:41:45,372 --> 01:41:46,741
Whoo!

2164
01:41:46,774 --> 01:41:48,743
Well, let's go and get it, then!

2165
01:41:48,776 --> 01:41:51,546
Get on out there and go!

2166
01:41:51,579 --> 01:41:54,649
Who's with me?!
Who is with me?! Let's go!

2167
01:41:54,682 --> 01:41:56,618
Cut! Yes!

2168
01:41:56,651 --> 01:41:58,485
So good, so good.

2169
01:41:58,519 --> 01:41:59,887
-Thank you.
-Was that it?

2170
01:41:59,921 --> 01:42:01,154
-God, yeah.
-Did we get it?

2171
01:42:01,188 --> 01:42:02,590
-It was so good.
-We got it?

2172
01:42:02,624 --> 01:42:04,224
-Magic. Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah, it was hot, babe.

2173
01:42:04,257 --> 01:42:05,627
Oh, my God. Gail was in floods.

2174
01:42:05,660 --> 01:42:07,427
I really felt that one.
I really felt that one.

2175
01:42:07,461 --> 01:42:09,162
-She was-- Of course you did.
-'Cause I had tears.

2176
01:42:09,196 --> 01:42:10,531
Of course you did.
Yeah, I know. I can see them.

2177
01:42:10,565 --> 01:42:12,366
--
-Yeah, it was fantastic.

2178
01:42:12,399 --> 01:42:14,669
So, listen, all we have left
is the alien truck coverage.

2179
01:42:14,702 --> 01:42:15,937
-All right? That's it.
-No.

2180
01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:17,605
-Yep. We're gonna do
the car jump. -No.

2181
01:42:17,639 --> 01:42:19,439
-No one told me about
another setup. -We said-- No.

2182
01:42:19,473 --> 01:42:21,274
-There's another setup?
-Venti's gonna do that in VFX,

2183
01:42:21,308 --> 01:42:22,810
-so we're out of here. -I know,
but we need his close-up.

2184
01:42:22,844 --> 01:42:24,545
All right? I need his close-up
right here for the coverage.

2185
01:42:24,579 --> 01:42:25,780
All right? 15 minutes tops.
That's all I need.

2186
01:42:25,813 --> 01:42:27,381
This is the bit,
do you remember,

2187
01:42:27,414 --> 01:42:28,783
-where Space Cowboy steals
the alien vehicle? -Hmm.

2188
01:42:28,816 --> 01:42:30,417
-Come on. This is his moment.
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

2189
01:42:30,450 --> 01:42:31,786
I'm not gonna do
any driving, right?

2190
01:42:31,819 --> 01:42:33,387
Because I'm gonna feel
really nauseous.

2191
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:34,722
It's a blue screen setup.

2192
01:42:34,756 --> 01:42:37,157
I need this. I need this, okay?

2193
01:42:37,825 --> 01:42:39,259
Zero notice here.

2194
01:42:39,292 --> 01:42:41,294
We're moving as fast
as we can, all right?

2195
01:42:41,328 --> 01:42:44,264
Everyone, double the pace, yes?!

2196
01:42:44,297 --> 01:42:46,601
Use those muscles!
Yes, good! Thank you!

2197
01:42:51,271 --> 01:42:53,808
Everyone in position!

2198
01:42:53,841 --> 01:42:55,710
Light the pyro!

2199
01:42:56,711 --> 01:43:01,281
We need enough charges to blow
this canyon sky-high, people.

2200
01:43:01,314 --> 01:43:02,917
McCabe, where are we?

2201
01:43:02,950 --> 01:43:04,317
Going as fast as I can, Nige.

2202
01:43:04,351 --> 01:43:05,687
We're as ready as we can be.

2203
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:07,254
Okay. Hey, get Ray to come in

2204
01:43:07,287 --> 01:43:08,890
-and check the mic
before we go, okay? -Copy.

2205
01:43:08,923 --> 01:43:12,225
Sound, can you come down here
and check Ryder's mic, please?

2206
01:43:16,931 --> 01:43:18,498
All right, Tom. You ready?

2207
01:43:18,533 --> 01:43:20,300
-Yeah.
-Okay. Remember this bit?

2208
01:43:20,333 --> 01:43:21,435
-You're gonna be in
the alien vehicle. -Mm-hmm.

2209
01:43:21,468 --> 01:43:22,637
-Okay? Okay.
-Yep.

2210
01:43:22,670 --> 01:43:23,538
And with nowhere to go,

2211
01:43:23,571 --> 01:43:25,272
you're gonna jump the car
over the ravine.

2212
01:43:25,305 --> 01:43:26,808
So I just need
a quick pop on you...

2213
01:43:26,841 --> 01:43:28,576
Space Cowboy
ain't scared of no ravine.

2214
01:43:28,609 --> 01:43:30,477
-Of course he's not.
-So I'm thinking maybe just

2215
01:43:30,511 --> 01:43:31,846
-a couple of reaction shots
of me gritting my teeth. -Yeah.

2216
01:43:31,879 --> 01:43:32,747
Like, "Goddamn."
Something like that.

2217
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:33,981
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Stoic.

2218
01:43:34,015 --> 01:43:35,415
-Yeah, yeah. I like it.
-All right?

2219
01:43:35,449 --> 01:43:36,851
-What do you think?
-I like it. Okay.

2220
01:43:36,884 --> 01:43:38,251
I think it's gonna be great.
Yeah, I love the choice.

2221
01:43:38,285 --> 01:43:39,453
All right, let's pop these on.

2222
01:43:39,486 --> 01:43:40,988
-Okay. What's this?
-There you go.

2223
01:43:41,022 --> 01:43:42,456
No, this is because
you've escaped the aliens.

2224
01:43:42,489 --> 01:43:43,658
Is this necessary?
It's a bit much, no?

2225
01:43:43,691 --> 01:43:44,726
Yeah. It looks cool.
Raise the stakes.

2226
01:43:44,759 --> 01:43:46,393
It's kind of cool.

2227
01:43:46,426 --> 01:43:47,762
-Yeah. It's cool. Okay.
-Raise the stakes.

2228
01:43:47,795 --> 01:43:49,262
-Let's do it.
-'Cause you know, Space Cowboy.

2229
01:43:49,296 --> 01:43:50,765
Nobody can get at
the Space Cowboy.

2230
01:43:50,798 --> 01:43:52,600
-No way. Even when he's cuffed.
-Excuse me. Tom, sorry.

2231
01:43:52,633 --> 01:43:54,334
Jesus, Ray. I told you
to do it before I got on set.

2232
01:43:54,367 --> 01:43:55,970
Appreciate you, Tom.

2233
01:43:56,003 --> 01:43:56,971
Thank you. Sound good.

2234
01:43:57,004 --> 01:43:58,338
-Okay.
-Okay, great.

2235
01:43:58,371 --> 01:43:59,607
-So...
-So...

2236
01:43:59,640 --> 01:44:00,975
-You got this guy
coming on your left. -Yep.

2237
01:44:01,008 --> 01:44:02,543
-Hey, bro.
-All right, take him out.

2238
01:44:02,577 --> 01:44:03,711
Someone else is gonna
crash down on the bonnet.

2239
01:44:03,745 --> 01:44:05,345
You're gonna take him out.

2240
01:44:05,378 --> 01:44:06,781
No, no, no. See, what I'm
thinking is maybe I come down,

2241
01:44:06,814 --> 01:44:09,550
I take him out first,
and I'm like "pow, pow, pow."

2242
01:44:09,584 --> 01:44:11,586
-I slide over and go "pow."
-Yeah. Yeah.

2243
01:44:11,619 --> 01:44:13,487
And then maybe I say
a little line like,

2244
01:44:13,521 --> 01:44:16,557
"I was shooting aliens
way before I was paid to."

2245
01:44:16,591 --> 01:44:18,593
Fantastic.
All right, let's lock it up.

2246
01:44:18,626 --> 01:44:20,762
-Let's shoot, Nigel.
-Standing by, please.

2247
01:44:20,795 --> 01:44:21,829
All right.

2248
01:44:21,863 --> 01:44:23,064
Take one. Marker.

2249
01:44:23,097 --> 01:44:26,701
In three, two, one, action.

2250
01:44:27,935 --> 01:44:29,637
Not your lucky day, alien.

2251
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:31,471
You got to go.

2252
01:44:32,372 --> 01:44:33,406
You can't outrun me.

2253
01:44:33,440 --> 01:44:35,910
I'm Space Cowboy!

2254
01:44:35,943 --> 01:44:37,011
Yahoo!

2255
01:44:37,044 --> 01:44:38,880
You are approaching the ravine.

2256
01:44:38,913 --> 01:44:40,014
There's nowhere else to go.

2257
01:44:40,047 --> 01:44:41,883
Turn right. Go on.

2258
01:44:41,916 --> 01:44:43,084
You have no choice.

2259
01:44:43,117 --> 01:44:44,085
You're gonna
have to make the jump.

2260
01:44:44,118 --> 01:44:47,088
In three, two, one.

2261
01:44:47,121 --> 01:44:50,525
Yeehaw!

2262
01:44:50,558 --> 01:44:52,026
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, hey, hey, hey.

2263
01:44:52,059 --> 01:44:53,628
Who is that in the car with him?

2264
01:44:53,661 --> 01:44:56,396
We're-we're in the middle
of a take right now, asshole.

2265
01:44:56,429 --> 01:44:57,932
What are you doing? Ah!

2266
01:44:57,965 --> 01:45:00,367
-He's just buckling you in.
Safety first. That's it. -Ow!

2267
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,537
It's really tight.
Is this necessary?

2268
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:04,572
Hey, we are filming right now.

2269
01:45:04,605 --> 01:45:06,674
Keep rolling, keep rolling.

2270
01:45:06,707 --> 01:45:08,375
Sell it, Tom. It looks amazing.
Take a deep breath.

2271
01:45:08,408 --> 01:45:10,611
It does not look--
Get out of the car.

2272
01:45:11,746 --> 01:45:12,580
Howdy.

2273
01:45:12,613 --> 01:45:14,849
No, no, wait. Stop. No.

2274
01:45:15,850 --> 01:45:16,884
Wait, what's happening?

2275
01:45:16,918 --> 01:45:18,820
Yeehaw!

2276
01:45:18,853 --> 01:45:20,955
Oh, my God! Whoa!

2277
01:45:20,988 --> 01:45:23,456
Get to the cars!

2278
01:45:26,127 --> 01:45:27,728
Jody, what the hell
are you doing?!

2279
01:45:27,762 --> 01:45:28,896
I'm trying to get something
real out of him, Gail.

2280
01:45:28,930 --> 01:45:30,463
There's no cameras on him!

2281
01:45:32,465 --> 01:45:35,603
Hey, Dan? They're approaching
Ambush Alley right now.

2282
01:45:35,636 --> 01:45:36,804
We're ready.

2283
01:45:38,405 --> 01:45:40,975
Let me out right now!

2284
01:45:41,008 --> 01:45:44,145
What are you gonna do, huh?
You gonna kill me? Again?!

2285
01:45:49,150 --> 01:45:51,619
-Can you untie me?
-No.

2286
01:45:57,925 --> 01:45:59,492
McCabe!

2287
01:45:59,527 --> 01:46:03,030
Smoke screen in three, two, one!

2288
01:46:03,064 --> 01:46:04,999
Whoa!

2289
01:46:05,032 --> 01:46:06,968
This does not seem safe, man!

2290
01:46:12,472 --> 01:46:14,909
Dan, where are they?
Do you have eyes on them?

2291
01:46:14,942 --> 01:46:17,645
I see 'em.
Everything's going to plan.

2292
01:46:20,114 --> 01:46:22,016
I'll block the road.

2293
01:46:22,049 --> 01:46:23,784
They shall not pass!

2294
01:46:23,818 --> 01:46:26,821
I see them.
They're entering Ambush Alley.

2295
01:46:31,225 --> 01:46:33,393
I can't see shit!

2296
01:46:34,929 --> 01:46:36,931
McCabe, one!

2297
01:46:37,899 --> 01:46:40,467
McCabe, two!

2298
01:46:43,804 --> 01:46:45,606
McCabe! Now!

2299
01:46:55,549 --> 01:46:57,417
I love my job.

2300
01:47:01,255 --> 01:47:05,126
Whoa, mama!

2301
01:47:05,159 --> 01:47:07,194
Oh, goddamn!

2302
01:47:07,228 --> 01:47:10,064
I can't think straight when
you drive like this.

2303
01:47:10,097 --> 01:47:11,565
You're supposed to be dead.

2304
01:47:11,599 --> 01:47:14,802
You blew up
in-in a thousand pieces.

2305
01:47:14,835 --> 01:47:15,670
You went kaboom.

2306
01:47:15,703 --> 01:47:18,606
Why would I have blown up,
Tom Ryder?

2307
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:20,808
Why are you saying my name
like that?

2308
01:47:20,841 --> 01:47:22,610
-That is your name,
isn't it, Tom Ryder? -Yes, yes.

2309
01:47:22,643 --> 01:47:23,945
A blind man could see
that you're

2310
01:47:23,978 --> 01:47:25,646
-Tom Ryder.
-You're saying that like...

2311
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:26,981
-"Ryder, Tom Ryder."
-Okay. That's me.

2312
01:47:27,014 --> 01:47:28,549
You're saying it like
some obsessed fangirl.

2313
01:47:28,582 --> 01:47:29,850
That's me, Colt Seavers,
saying that.

2314
01:47:29,884 --> 01:47:31,552
Roll the cameras.
We're heading for the jump.

2315
01:47:31,585 --> 01:47:32,887
Tom Ryder's
doing his own stunts!

2316
01:47:32,920 --> 01:47:34,789
Everyone, roll. Arm car?

2317
01:47:34,822 --> 01:47:35,957
Check.

2318
01:47:35,990 --> 01:47:37,191
-Heli.
-Check.

2319
01:47:37,224 --> 01:47:38,726
I'm done taking the falls
for you.

2320
01:47:38,759 --> 01:47:40,493
You're gonna do your own stunts
from now on.

2321
01:47:40,528 --> 01:47:41,862
-I don't want to do
my own stunts, Colt! -Relax.

2322
01:47:41,896 --> 01:47:43,898
It's just a 250-foot jump
that'll probably kill us.

2323
01:47:43,931 --> 01:47:46,600
It's never been done before.
It's for Comic-Con.

2324
01:47:46,634 --> 01:47:49,570
-It's Hall H. It's a big deal.
-What are you doing, man?

2325
01:47:49,603 --> 01:47:50,838
I thought it'd be fitting.

2326
01:47:50,871 --> 01:47:53,240
Me and you, Tom Ryder,
one last stunt.

2327
01:47:53,274 --> 01:47:55,576
You know,
like Thelma and Louise.

2328
01:47:55,609 --> 01:47:57,511
-Thelma and Louise?
-Yeah.

2329
01:47:57,545 --> 01:47:59,847
-They die at the end.
-Exactly!

2330
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,582
Murder-suicide.

2331
01:48:01,615 --> 01:48:03,751
Can you just pull over
and let me out right now?

2332
01:48:04,785 --> 01:48:07,254
You're not getting
out of this car until you,

2333
01:48:07,288 --> 01:48:09,724
Tom Ryder, tell me,
Colt Seavers, the truth!

2334
01:48:09,757 --> 01:48:10,958
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

2335
01:48:10,992 --> 01:48:12,293
It was all Gail.

2336
01:48:12,326 --> 01:48:14,295
When I killed Henry,
she wanted to cover it up

2337
01:48:14,328 --> 01:48:15,863
because, to be honest,

2338
01:48:15,896 --> 01:48:18,532
Space Cowboy's one of
my best roles yet, Colt,

2339
01:48:18,566 --> 01:48:20,134
and I don't want
this movie to fail.

2340
01:48:20,167 --> 01:48:21,736
So you're saying that Gail Meyer

2341
01:48:21,769 --> 01:48:24,972
was responsible for framing me
for your murder of Henry?

2342
01:48:25,006 --> 01:48:26,741
Yes! Yes!

2343
01:48:26,774 --> 01:48:28,743
But what's your real name?

2344
01:48:28,776 --> 01:48:30,511
Tom Ryder.

2345
01:48:31,178 --> 01:48:32,646
Did you get that, Jody?

2346
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:34,915
We got it! He confessed.

2347
01:48:34,949 --> 01:48:36,684
You wearing a wire?
Bro, you recording this?

2348
01:48:36,717 --> 01:48:38,285
This is entrapment.
You can't do that.

2349
01:48:38,319 --> 01:48:39,887
-What are you doing?
-No, it's not entrapment,

2350
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:42,790
because you're wearing
the wire, dipshit!

2351
01:48:46,727 --> 01:48:48,062
He's going for it. Go. Go now.

2352
01:48:48,095 --> 01:48:49,764
I'm just an actor!

2353
01:48:49,797 --> 01:48:50,931
Wait.

2354
01:48:50,965 --> 01:48:52,666
He has a mouth guard.

2355
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:55,202
I don't have a mouth guard.

2356
01:49:42,983 --> 01:49:44,952
-Oh, good.
-Colt!

2357
01:49:44,985 --> 01:49:47,388
-You're alive.
-Are you okay?

2358
01:49:49,023 --> 01:49:49,990
Are you okay?

2359
01:49:50,024 --> 01:49:52,126
I told you
I'd make the camera up to you.

2360
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:53,828
Oh, it was fantastic.

2361
01:49:53,861 --> 01:49:55,629
-Dressler, come in!
-Ah!

2362
01:49:55,663 --> 01:49:58,032
Oy, can you hear me?
We've got to get out of here!

2363
01:49:58,065 --> 01:49:59,400
This is all Gail's fault, man.

2364
01:49:59,433 --> 01:50:01,001
This is all Gail's idea.

2365
01:50:01,035 --> 01:50:02,403
Give me that confession!
-No.

2366
01:50:02,436 --> 01:50:04,171
Give me all the media!
Are you deaf?!

2367
01:50:04,205 --> 01:50:07,308
Dressler, bring
the helicopter to the trench.

2368
01:50:07,341 --> 01:50:08,642
-What about Ryder?
-Now!

2369
01:50:08,676 --> 01:50:10,044
Now, about this date.

2370
01:50:10,077 --> 01:50:12,780
Put it in the case, you numpty!

2371
01:50:12,813 --> 01:50:13,981
Can we call it a date?

2372
01:50:14,014 --> 01:50:17,184
I mean,
that's what it is, right?

2373
01:50:17,218 --> 01:50:18,252
Such a moron!

2374
01:50:19,353 --> 01:50:22,156
-Hurry up! God!
--Take it.

2375
01:50:22,189 --> 01:50:23,891
Gail, Gail, Gail.

2376
01:50:23,924 --> 01:50:25,960
-Listen...
-Give me the recording, Gail.

2377
01:50:25,993 --> 01:50:28,896
Darling, calm down.
Just come with me.

2378
01:50:28,929 --> 01:50:31,398
We don't need
all this toxic masculinity,

2379
01:50:31,432 --> 01:50:32,867
because we're the same,
you and me.

2380
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:34,735
You know, we're survivors.

2381
01:50:34,768 --> 01:50:36,403
No, no, no, no.
I'm nothing like you.

2382
01:50:36,437 --> 01:50:38,873
I don't want to be
presumptuous, I mean,

2383
01:50:38,906 --> 01:50:41,709
but let's call a spade a spade.

2384
01:50:41,742 --> 01:50:43,410
That's why I gave you the job.

2385
01:50:43,444 --> 01:50:44,912
-Okay.
-Well, that and because

2386
01:50:44,945 --> 01:50:48,282
you're so easily moldable,
you know?

2387
01:50:49,049 --> 01:50:51,719
-Oh!
-Gail, just give me the case!

2388
01:50:51,752 --> 01:50:53,420
This is a Gail Meyer production!

2389
01:50:53,454 --> 01:50:55,022
Not yours!

2390
01:50:55,055 --> 01:50:57,291
Rendezvous with the boss
in the canyon.

2391
01:50:57,324 --> 01:50:58,459
Extraction to the spaceship set.

2392
01:50:58,492 --> 01:51:00,294
Spaceship set?

2393
01:51:00,327 --> 01:51:02,830
Oh, no, Big Red.

2394
01:51:02,863 --> 01:51:04,832
I don't think
you're gonna make that one.

2395
01:51:04,865 --> 01:51:07,201
-Stunts set!
-Stunts set!

2396
01:51:07,234 --> 01:51:09,703
Go!

2397
01:51:21,982 --> 01:51:24,718
Trust me, I will not
be taking the fall for this,

2398
01:51:24,752 --> 01:51:29,790
because I deliver hits
for all you little people.

2399
01:51:29,823 --> 01:51:30,791
You're welcome.

2400
01:51:30,824 --> 01:51:34,028
Whoa!

2401
01:51:34,061 --> 01:51:35,229
Jody?

2402
01:51:38,132 --> 01:51:40,935
-Jody? -Hey, hey!
That's for me! That's for me!

2403
01:51:40,968 --> 01:51:42,770
That's my helicopter!

2404
01:51:42,803 --> 01:51:45,739
This crazy stuntman's
lost his mind!

2405
01:51:59,286 --> 01:52:00,487
I'm on vacation!

2406
01:52:13,968 --> 01:52:16,170
Get this dog off me!
Not again, dog.

2407
01:52:17,404 --> 01:52:18,906
Just stay there!

2408
01:52:19,807 --> 01:52:22,810
Night-night, dog! You're dead.

2409
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:36,056
This design is growing on me.

2410
01:52:37,324 --> 01:52:40,861
Get in! Let's get out of here!

2411
01:52:40,894 --> 01:52:42,763
Yeah, copy that.
Taking off now.

2412
01:52:43,931 --> 01:52:45,366
Wait, what-what is this?

2413
01:52:45,399 --> 01:52:46,568
It's the evidence!

2414
01:52:46,601 --> 01:52:48,469
Why didn't you just
stop talking?!

2415
01:52:48,502 --> 01:52:49,937
Jody!

2416
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:52,006
Blow the pyros. Blow the pyros!

2417
01:52:52,039 --> 01:52:53,974
They're getting away!

2418
01:52:57,545 --> 01:52:59,547
-Whoa! Sh-- Whoa!
-Holy shit!

2419
01:52:59,581 --> 01:53:02,016
-Lower the arm! I'm gonna jump.
-Okay.

2420
01:53:02,049 --> 01:53:04,285
Okay, lower the arm.
Lower the arm.

2421
01:53:08,322 --> 01:53:10,057
I have a plan!

2422
01:53:10,090 --> 01:53:12,026
What is it?
What's-what's the plan?

2423
01:53:12,059 --> 01:53:13,027
Get me to the helicopter.

2424
01:53:13,060 --> 01:53:14,328
I'm gonna jump onto the skids,

2425
01:53:14,361 --> 01:53:15,530
and then I'm gonna
beat the shit out of him.

2426
01:53:15,563 --> 01:53:17,131
No, just-just get the recording.

2427
01:53:31,278 --> 01:53:32,813
Go!

2428
01:53:33,213 --> 01:53:34,248
Ah, shit.

2429
01:53:34,281 --> 01:53:35,816
Go!

2430
01:53:36,483 --> 01:53:39,253
Whoa! Whoa! Get me down!

2431
01:53:39,286 --> 01:53:40,921
Whoa! Get me down!

2432
01:53:40,954 --> 01:53:42,056
We're losing hydraulics here.

2433
01:53:42,089 --> 01:53:43,357
I can't get it under control.

2434
01:53:44,358 --> 01:53:46,160
Just wondering,
you know, after this movie,

2435
01:53:46,193 --> 01:53:49,163
and if I don't go to prison
and, you know, you're not busy,

2436
01:53:49,196 --> 01:53:50,931
maybe we could go
to a beach somewhere.

2437
01:53:50,964 --> 01:53:53,200
Wear a couple of
swimming costumes.

2438
01:53:53,233 --> 01:53:55,336
Just drink a spicy margarita
or something.

2439
01:53:55,369 --> 01:53:57,639
-Yeah, yeah.
Make some bad decisions. -Yeah.

2440
01:53:57,672 --> 01:53:59,239
Okay, sure. Yes.

2441
01:53:59,273 --> 01:54:00,974
-Sound like a plan?
-It's a better plan than this.

2442
01:54:01,008 --> 01:54:03,077
Okay, please be careful.

2443
01:54:03,110 --> 01:54:05,012
Okay, swing him around. Go!

2444
01:54:22,096 --> 01:54:24,131
God, get it under control!

2445
01:54:24,164 --> 01:54:26,433
Get us out of here!
What are you doing?!

2446
01:54:32,506 --> 01:54:34,375
Ryder, the confession!

2447
01:54:34,408 --> 01:54:35,643
No!

2448
01:54:35,677 --> 01:54:38,011
-No! No, Gail, no!
--No, Gail!

2449
01:54:40,314 --> 01:54:42,049
Whoa! Whoa!

2450
01:54:43,551 --> 01:54:45,386
Stunts!

2451
01:54:45,419 --> 01:54:47,488
Mobilize that airbag now!

2452
01:54:47,522 --> 01:54:48,690
No!

2453
01:54:52,226 --> 01:54:54,294
Get out of the way, Ryder!

2454
01:54:56,296 --> 01:54:58,700
87North to the rescue!

2455
01:54:58,733 --> 01:55:00,568
-Go, go, go, go!
-Go!

2456
01:55:00,602 --> 01:55:02,503
Move, move, move!

2457
01:55:04,037 --> 01:55:05,305
Get it!

2458
01:55:07,241 --> 01:55:09,009
Just keep it steady!

2459
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:11,912
You moron!

2460
01:55:20,988 --> 01:55:23,424
Yes! Nice!

2461

2462
01:55:39,674 --> 01:55:41,942
Yes!

2463

-Oh, God!
-Oh, shit!

2464
01:55:47,347 --> 01:55:49,149
No!

2465
01:55:49,183 --> 01:55:50,618
Grab it!

2466
01:55:52,019 --> 01:55:53,287
Oh, my God! My nose!

2467
01:55:57,090 --> 01:56:00,127
No! Ryder, the gun!

2468
01:56:05,667 --> 01:56:07,401
Shoot him!
He's a stupid stuntman!

2469
01:56:07,434 --> 01:56:09,069
No one gives a shit!

2470
01:56:09,102 --> 01:56:11,205
He's one of the best
stunt doubles I've ever had!

2471
01:56:11,238 --> 01:56:14,174
Oh, shut up!
Give me the confession!

2472
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:16,176
Come on, come on, come on!
Quick!

2473
01:56:16,210 --> 01:56:18,078
Give it back to me
or I will blow your head off!
