00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:56,658
<i>Imperial Diary. Year 10,191.
Third comment.</i>

2
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:03,430
<i>The battle for Arrakis
took everyone by surprise.</i>

3
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:05,667
<i>There were no witnesses.</i>

4
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:10,805
<i>The Harkonnen operation
was perpetrated overnight,</i>

5
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:14,709
<i>without warning
or declaration of war.</i>

6
00:01:16,878 --> 00:01:19,413
<i>By morning,
the Atreides were no more.</i>

7
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:22,316
<i>All died in the dark.</i>

8
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:32,794
<i>And the Emperor said...</i>

9
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:37,363
<i>nothing.</i>

10
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:42,302
<i>Since that night, my father
has not been the same.</i>

11
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:44,605
<i>Nor have I.</i>

12
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,811
<i>His inaction
is difficult for me to accept.</i>

13
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:52,747
<i>For, I know he loved
Duke Leto Atreides like a son.</i>

14
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,922
<i>But my father's
always been guided</i>

15
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:05,325
<i>by the calculus of power.</i>

16
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:08,328
<i>This would not be the first time the
Harkonnens have done his dirty work.</i>

17
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,406
In the shadows of Arrakis
lie many secrets...

18
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:24,277
<i>but the darkest of them all
may remain.</i>

19
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,615
<i>The end of House Atreides.</i>

20
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:46,868
<i>Sister, Father is dead.</i>

21
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:50,303
<i>Shouldn't you go back
to the stars,</i>

22
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,304
<i>be with him?</i>

23
00:02:54,742 --> 00:02:57,912
<i>I'm afraid I won't have enough
time to fix things before your coming.</i>

24
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,717
<i>This world is beyond cruelty.</i>

25
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:10,985
Stay here.

26
00:09:00,174 --> 00:09:03,611
Never stand with your back
towards the open.

27
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,288
How many times do I have
to tell you that, huh?

28
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:07,681
You okay?

29
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,950
- Yeah.
- How 'bout her?

30
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,019
She's fine.

31
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:23,764
They do not usually
venture this deep.

32
00:09:23,798 --> 00:09:25,633
They wanna make sure
no Atreides escaped.

33
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,102
You think too much of yourself.

34
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:30,871
No, no,
we are in the deep desert.

35
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:33,741
Only Fremen can survive here.

36
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:36,110
They were here for us,
not for you.

37
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:39,080
Don't worry.

38
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:42,183
I'm taking you somewhere
they will never find us.

39
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,635
Filthy water.

40
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:05,739
It's full of chemicals, but good
enough for cooling systems.

41
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:10,777
Don't let it out.

42
00:10:13,047 --> 00:10:15,182
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

43
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:16,383
Don't let that out.

44
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,752
Don't let it out!

45
00:10:23,057 --> 00:10:24,158
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

46
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,191
Mm-hmm.

47
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:30,931
You fought well...

48
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,167
once you woke up.

49
00:10:34,435 --> 00:10:35,435
I wasn't sleeping.

50
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,936
No, no, no. I'll do it.

51
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,769
Lor... Lord Rabban.

52
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:17,905
Now that the spice fields
have been secured,

53
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:21,175
I strongly recommend bringing
all troops out of Fremen territories.

54
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,077
We're losing too many men
to the desert.

55
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,411
Rats.

56
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:29,083
- I beg your pardon?
- We're losing men to rats.

57
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:34,321
Fremen!
I can't confirm, my Lord.

58
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:36,190
Communications are hectic
in the open sands.

59
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,093
Your orders were to control
the whole planet.

60
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:43,998
- We are.
- I see only half of it.

61
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:45,232
As you may recall,

62
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:48,102
the South is uninhabitable,
my Lord.

63
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,306
May I suggest you get some rest?

64
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:55,242
Rats! Hairy rats!

65
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:57,579
Kill them! Kill them!
Kill them all!

66
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,547
Kill them all!

67
00:12:59,581 --> 00:13:02,116
<i>Rats!</i>

68
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:49,597
He's asking why we're so late.

69
00:13:55,436 --> 00:13:56,504
He thinks you're spies.

70
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:01,543
- He said...
- I got that.

71
00:14:01,576 --> 00:14:05,112
- Thanks.
- Stay close to me. Hmm?

72
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:26,367
Sietch Tabr.

73
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:01,663
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

74
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:04,191
Look how your Bene Gesserit
propaganda has taken root.

75
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,162
Some of them already think
I'm their messiah.

76
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:12,165
Others...

77
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:14,735
false prophet.

78
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,373
I must sway the non-believers.

79
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:22,409
If they follow me, we can
disrupt spice production.

80
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,278
That's the only way
I can get to the Emperor.

81
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,481
Your father didn't believe
in revenge.

82
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,650
Yeah, well, I do.

83
00:18:03,283 --> 00:18:04,283
What is happening?

84
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:14,562
What is it?

85
00:18:14,596 --> 00:18:16,296
There is spice in the food.

86
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:28,241
Woman.

87
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,179
Come with me.

88
00:19:41,783 --> 00:19:45,252
Thirty-eight million decaliters.

89
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:50,792
None of us, even dying of
thirst, would ever drink this water.

90
00:19:50,825 --> 00:19:51,859
This is...

91
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:54,529
sacred.

92
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,767
Jamis' water.

93
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:04,639
We have a thousand such places.

94
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,010
When we have enough water,

95
00:20:09,043 --> 00:20:13,648
the <i>Lisan al-Gaib</i> will change
the face of Arrakis.

96
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:16,316
He will bring back the trees.
He will bring back...

97
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:19,520
a Green Paradise.

98
00:20:22,657 --> 00:20:24,357
So many souls.

99
00:20:34,702 --> 00:20:38,438
Never give your water away,
not even for the dead. Hmm?

100
00:20:41,341 --> 00:20:42,744
Why are you showing me this?

101
00:20:42,777 --> 00:20:44,478
Because you are Bene Gesserit.

102
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:48,448
Because you understand
the prophecies.

103
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:51,786
The mother of the <i>Lisan al-Gaib</i>
will be a Reverend Mother.

104
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:55,590
Our Reverend Mother is dying.

105
00:20:57,424 --> 00:20:59,627
You want me to take her place?

106
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,530
Yes, I do.

107
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:06,433
You believe in Paul?

108
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:10,638
There are signs.

109
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:13,775
Yes.

110
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:17,078
What if I would refuse?

111
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:20,014
Mmm.
Then, he's not <i>Lisan al-Gaib,</i>

112
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:22,083
and you have no purpose
to serve.

113
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:26,087
What else is left to do then but
to return your water to the well?

114
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,688
Huh.

115
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,560
It's an honor, isn't it?

116
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:35,830
I think you should feel honored.

117
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:37,899
Well, it was a choice
between this or death,

118
00:21:37,932 --> 00:21:39,767
so, you know, forgive me
if I'm not flattered.

119
00:21:41,936 --> 00:21:43,638
How does one become
a Reverend Mother?

120
00:21:43,671 --> 00:21:45,640
It's different from one culture
to another.

121
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:47,575
Here on Arrakis, I have no idea.

122
00:21:51,913 --> 00:21:54,081
You're afraid.

123
00:21:54,115 --> 00:21:56,026
Reverend Mothers are tasked
with holding the memories

124
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,895
of all the Reverend Mothers
that came before them,

125
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,088
so I'll be given centuries
of pain and sorrow.

126
00:22:01,923 --> 00:22:02,923
Is it dangerous?

127
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,425
It's lethal for men.

128
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,862
That's for sure.

129
00:23:16,197 --> 00:23:18,132
What are you guys
laughing about?

130
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:19,399
Don't bother.

131
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:25,773
You don't believe in all this?

132
00:23:25,806 --> 00:23:27,440
No, we don't.

133
00:23:27,474 --> 00:23:29,143
These are old Southern beliefs.

134
00:23:29,176 --> 00:23:31,444
Southern beliefs?

135
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:34,782
Southern tribes believe a messiah
will come to deliver us from evil.

136
00:23:34,815 --> 00:23:36,884
You don't believe
in the <i>Lisan al-Gaib?</i>

137
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:39,220
We believe in Fremen.

138
00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:44,725
You want to control people,
you tell them a messiah will come.

139
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,495
- Mm-hmm.
- Then they'll wait for centuries.

140
00:23:51,565 --> 00:23:54,635
Now, we must pray.

141
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,077
What about him?

142
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,812
- Stilgar?
- Mm-hmm.

143
00:24:04,845 --> 00:24:07,949
He's from the South.
You didn't notice his accent?

144
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:18,259
What'll happen to my mother?

145
00:24:40,715 --> 00:24:43,551
I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.

146
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:46,554
Fear, the little death
that brings total obliteration.

147
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:48,656
I will face my fear. I will...

148
00:25:15,282 --> 00:25:16,183
What is it?

149
00:25:16,217 --> 00:25:17,217
Drink!

150
00:27:27,915 --> 00:27:30,217
She's right. She's right!

151
00:27:32,386 --> 00:27:33,420
It's no miracle.

152
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:37,892
My mother was trained
to do that.

153
00:27:37,925 --> 00:27:40,828
Poison transmutation is something
advanced Bene Gesserit can do.

154
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:45,432
I'm not the <i>Mahdi.</i>

155
00:27:49,103 --> 00:27:50,304
I'm not here to lead.

156
00:27:56,511 --> 00:27:59,747
Let me fight beside you.
That's all I'm asking.

157
00:28:23,204 --> 00:28:24,204
How are you?

158
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:26,173
Better.

159
00:28:27,274 --> 00:28:28,275
How is she?

160
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,412
She was frightened, but she's...

161
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,081
she's okay.

162
00:28:40,287 --> 00:28:41,287
Paul.

163
00:28:44,425 --> 00:28:46,126
She talks to me.

164
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:51,165
She believes in you.

165
00:28:54,569 --> 00:28:55,836
She says...

166
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,346
You're so close now.

167
00:29:05,379 --> 00:29:09,383
Only one step remains and you
will become the <i>Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

168
00:29:10,484 --> 00:29:12,253
Only one step remains.

169
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,855
You must do what I did.

170
00:29:14,888 --> 00:29:18,192
You must drink
the Water of Life.

171
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:21,895
And your mind, it's gon... it's
gonna open and you will see.

172
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,579
If you wanna fight with us,
first thing, you must learn

173
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:39,547
to be one with the desert.

174
00:29:41,181 --> 00:29:44,552
So, here is a tent
and enough food.

175
00:29:44,586 --> 00:29:49,323
I want you to cross
that small erg and come back.

176
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:51,859
Travel by night.

177
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:53,360
You know how to use
a paracompass?

178
00:29:53,394 --> 00:29:54,394
- Yes.
- Oh.

179
00:29:57,532 --> 00:29:59,066
Anything else I should know?

180
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:01,503
Uh, beside the worms
and the Harkonnens,

181
00:30:01,536 --> 00:30:05,272
beware of the trapdoor spiders.

182
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:08,876
Centipedes are very nasty.
Not the big ones.

183
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:10,545
They are harmless.

184
00:30:10,578 --> 00:30:14,248
But the little ones, you have
to worry about. And... Oh!

185
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,387
Don't ever,
ever listen to the jinn.

186
00:30:22,657 --> 00:30:24,325
- The jinn?
- Jinn.

187
00:30:24,358 --> 00:30:26,026
Desert spirits.

188
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:30,130
They whisper at night.

189
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:37,104
They, they can possess you.

190
00:30:37,137 --> 00:30:41,175
Really, be careful.
They are demons.

191
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:46,213
But it's true.
Don't listen to them.

192
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:13,167
Jamis.

193
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:18,005
You sandwalk
like a drunk lizard.

194
00:32:21,241 --> 00:32:22,744
Yeah, I'm doing
pretty good so far.

195
00:32:22,777 --> 00:32:25,345
Yeah, well, you're not even
in worm territory yet.

196
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:46,066
You have to break up
your rhythm.

197
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,406
Like this.

198
00:32:52,439 --> 00:32:55,309
Now, that's interesting because
in the filmbooks I've studied,

199
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:58,613
the anthropologists say, in order to
properly sandwalk, you actually have...

200
00:33:02,416 --> 00:33:04,552
Never mind. Please keep going.

201
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,416
You know, I'm the only one who believes
you're gonna make it until summer?

202
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:38,370
Everyone else thinks
you won't make it two weeks.

203
00:33:39,587 --> 00:33:41,054
If you wanna follow us
in the desert,

204
00:33:41,088 --> 00:33:42,524
you need to know
how windtraps work.

205
00:33:42,557 --> 00:33:44,358
So, listen to me.

206
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:46,661
They're simple, but they
require constant attention.

207
00:33:46,694 --> 00:33:50,163
Uh, this right here,
it captures the moisture

208
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:51,757
and then it carries it
into that pocket.

209
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:55,803
Uh, and these are the filters.

210
00:33:55,837 --> 00:33:57,505
They need to be changed
every three days.

211
00:33:59,406 --> 00:34:00,406
What?

212
00:34:05,112 --> 00:34:06,614
Stop looking at me like that.

213
00:34:12,152 --> 00:34:13,688
He's training with the Fremen.

214
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:15,690
He will be back soon.
Don't worry.

215
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:17,824
Mm-hmm.

216
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:22,730
You're right. If we want
to protect your brother,

217
00:34:22,764 --> 00:34:25,867
we need all the Fremen
to believe in the prophecy.

218
00:34:30,437 --> 00:34:34,709
<i>We must convert
the non-believers one by one.</i>

219
00:34:36,844 --> 00:34:39,379
<i>We need to start
with the weaker ones.</i>

220
00:34:40,548 --> 00:34:42,282
<i>The vulnerable ones.</i>

221
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:46,386
<i>The ones who fear us.</i>

222
00:35:09,476 --> 00:35:11,879
Hey, get out of here. Go.

223
00:36:54,582 --> 00:36:56,316
- You okay?
- Yeah.

224
00:37:33,755 --> 00:37:34,889
Let's go! Move!

225
00:37:52,439 --> 00:37:53,674
Load.

226
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:14,896
Chani!

227
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:20,934
Reload!

228
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,084
Ugh! Reload.

229
00:38:37,118 --> 00:38:38,385
Oh, watch out!

230
00:38:54,936 --> 00:38:57,104
Its shield will
only open when it fires.

231
00:38:57,138 --> 00:38:58,816
I know that.
What do you think I'm trying to do?

232
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,843
I'll trigger it.
On my signal. Be ready.

233
00:39:24,632 --> 00:39:25,933
Go!

234
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:29,604
Ah, shit!

235
00:39:32,073 --> 00:39:33,941
Go! Go!

236
00:40:39,974 --> 00:40:41,809
Who taught you
to fight like that?

237
00:40:41,842 --> 00:40:43,611
- My old masters.
- Hmm.

238
00:40:43,644 --> 00:40:44,912
They were close friends.

239
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:51,152
They were massacred.
Alongside my father.

240
00:40:56,724 --> 00:40:59,894
You've been fighting
the Harkonnens for decades.

241
00:40:59,927 --> 00:41:02,495
My family's been fighting them
for centuries.

242
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:07,500
I know everything about them.
Their habits, their ways of thinking.

243
00:41:07,535 --> 00:41:08,779
You know everything
about the desert.

244
00:41:08,803 --> 00:41:12,506
You harness
the very power of it.

245
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:17,278
We can stop them together, bury
them in the sand where they belong.

246
00:41:17,311 --> 00:41:19,780
So that this planet
can be yours once more.

247
00:41:19,814 --> 00:41:23,584
What would you
have us do? Huh?

248
00:41:23,617 --> 00:41:25,519
What would you do, Stilgar?

249
00:41:25,553 --> 00:41:29,623
I? I would... would
strike even further north.

250
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:31,525
Then I will go further north.

251
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:34,228
And the further north you go,
the more likely it is you die.

252
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:01,222
I see strength in you.

253
00:42:06,861 --> 00:42:08,095
Come, come.

254
00:42:18,205 --> 00:42:23,911
You shall be know
among us as <i>Usul.</i>

255
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:25,679
<i>- Usul.
- Usul.</i>

256
00:42:25,713 --> 00:42:29,784
<i>Usul.</i> And now,
a Fedaykin is a fighter

257
00:42:29,817 --> 00:42:31,018
and needs a war name.

258
00:42:31,986 --> 00:42:33,287
You must choose.

259
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:39,627
How do you call the, uh...

260
00:42:41,062 --> 00:42:42,797
The small desert mouse, again?

261
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:45,933
<i>- Muad'Dib?
- Muad'Dib.</i>

262
00:42:45,966 --> 00:42:48,602
No, no, no.

263
00:42:48,636 --> 00:42:52,306
<i>Muad'Dib</i> is wise
in the ways of the desert.

264
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:53,741
<i>Muad'Dib...</i>

265
00:42:54,775 --> 00:42:57,211
creates his own water.

266
00:42:57,244 --> 00:43:01,115
The constellation that points to
the North Star, we call <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

267
00:43:01,148 --> 00:43:02,950
"The One Who Points the Way."

268
00:43:04,819 --> 00:43:06,053
That is a powerful name.

269
00:43:10,991 --> 00:43:15,062
Now you are our brother. Mmm.

270
00:43:15,096 --> 00:43:18,232
Paul <i>Muad'Dib Usul.</i>

271
00:43:24,772 --> 00:43:25,873
<i>Muad'Dib Usul.</i>

272
00:43:26,707 --> 00:43:27,775
<i>Muad'Dib Usul.</i>

273
00:43:29,777 --> 00:43:31,045
<i>Muad'Dib Usul.</i>

274
00:43:33,347 --> 00:43:35,850
<i>Muad'Dib Usul.</i> Mm.

275
00:43:36,784 --> 00:43:37,784
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

276
00:43:40,921 --> 00:43:41,921
<i>Usul.</i>

277
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,042
Hey! Stilgar!

278
00:44:16,924 --> 00:44:18,325
Father, I found my way.

279
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:36,677
It's breathtaking.

280
00:44:45,419 --> 00:44:46,687
Hmm.

281
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:52,359
Look. Right there. Spice.

282
00:44:52,393 --> 00:44:55,229
Arrakis is so beautiful
when the sun is low.

283
00:45:02,903 --> 00:45:07,408
Where you're from, does water
really fall from the sky?

284
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:09,743
Oh, hm, yes.

285
00:45:09,777 --> 00:45:12,947
Sometimes it rains
for weeks on Caladan.

286
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,249
Where you see sand here,
imagine water.

287
00:45:18,419 --> 00:45:22,524
Our castle stands on cliffs
high above the sea.

288
00:45:22,557 --> 00:45:25,492
If you dive in,
you can't reach the bottom.

289
00:45:25,527 --> 00:45:29,496
- You dive in?
- Yes, it's called swimming.

290
00:45:29,531 --> 00:45:32,333
I don't...
I don't believe you, <i>Usul.</i>

291
00:45:32,366 --> 00:45:33,434
<i>Usul.</i>

292
00:45:36,136 --> 00:45:37,371
What's your secret name?

293
00:45:39,807 --> 00:45:41,442
<i>Sihaya.</i>

294
00:45:41,475 --> 00:45:42,843
<i>- Sihaya.</i>
- Hmm.

295
00:45:44,311 --> 00:45:46,046
What does that mean?

296
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,915
Means Desert Spring.

297
00:45:47,948 --> 00:45:49,016
"Desert Spring."

298
00:45:50,951 --> 00:45:52,419
- I love it.
- I hate it.

299
00:45:53,588 --> 00:45:55,456
It's from some stupid prophecy.

300
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:57,525
I prefer Chani.

301
00:45:58,593 --> 00:46:00,127
I prefer Chani, too, then.

302
00:46:07,234 --> 00:46:09,169
Do you think Stilgar
would teach me?

303
00:46:09,203 --> 00:46:10,904
- To ride?
- Yeah.

304
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:14,174
No. Only Fremen ride worms.

305
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:15,976
Well, I thought I'd become one,
didn't I?

306
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:17,878
By name, not by blood.

307
00:46:20,214 --> 00:46:24,918
Your blood comes
from Dukes and Great Houses.

308
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:29,256
We don't have that here.

309
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:33,294
Here, we're equal,
men and women alike.

310
00:46:33,327 --> 00:46:35,496
What we do,
we do for the benefit of all.

311
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:37,898
Well, I'd very much like
to be equal to you.

312
00:46:44,138 --> 00:46:47,374
Paul <i>Muad'Dib Usul...</i>

313
00:46:49,276 --> 00:46:51,445
maybe you could be Fremen.

314
00:46:54,649 --> 00:46:56,050
Maybe I'll show you the way.

315
00:48:25,105 --> 00:48:26,407
Rabban.

316
00:48:37,284 --> 00:48:41,656
Fremen attacks on your watch.

317
00:48:41,689 --> 00:48:47,662
Your orders were to restore
spice production to full capacity.

318
00:48:47,695 --> 00:48:50,130
Do you know
what it means if you fail?

319
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:55,637
The Emperor will take spice
out of our control.

320
00:48:56,638 --> 00:48:58,272
Tighten your grip, Rabban.

321
00:48:58,305 --> 00:49:00,340
Uncle.

322
00:49:00,374 --> 00:49:02,677
Or feel mine on your neck.

323
00:49:18,392 --> 00:49:20,528
<i>Usul? Usul.</i>

324
00:49:20,562 --> 00:49:23,363
It's okay. It's okay.

325
00:49:26,668 --> 00:49:27,668
Hey.

326
00:49:30,471 --> 00:49:33,575
I'm here, I'm here.

327
00:49:33,608 --> 00:49:36,678
It's been a while since you've
had one of those nightmares.

328
00:49:36,711 --> 00:49:37,711
Mm.

329
00:49:41,549 --> 00:49:43,685
Tell me, what was it about?

330
00:49:49,757 --> 00:49:53,060
<i>Nothing's clear.
It's only fragments.</i>

331
00:49:55,095 --> 00:49:59,032
<i>I'm in the South,
and I'm following someone.</i>

332
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,336
<i>And it triggers a holy war.</i>

333
00:50:05,807 --> 00:50:09,511
<i>Millions and millions of people
starving to death...</i>

334
00:50:10,845 --> 00:50:12,212
<i>because of me.</i>

335
00:50:18,118 --> 00:50:21,255
You've been exposed
to spice for a long time.

336
00:50:21,288 --> 00:50:23,357
It can create weird dreams.

337
00:50:30,397 --> 00:50:31,397
It's a big day.

338
00:50:33,433 --> 00:50:35,068
We can ask Stilgar
to call it off.

339
00:50:35,102 --> 00:50:37,572
No. I'm fine.

340
00:50:53,621 --> 00:50:54,621
<i>Usul.</i>

341
00:50:57,391 --> 00:50:59,326
I tuned it myself.

342
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:02,697
- Here.
- Thanks.

343
00:51:05,499 --> 00:51:09,336
Don't try to impress anyone.
You are brave. We all know that.

344
00:51:10,304 --> 00:51:12,674
Heh? Be simple.

345
00:51:12,707 --> 00:51:16,109
Be direct. Nothing fancy.

346
00:51:16,143 --> 00:51:18,278
- Nothing fancy.
- Hey, I'm serious.

347
00:51:18,312 --> 00:51:20,782
Nothing fancy or you will shame
my teaching.

348
00:51:20,815 --> 00:51:24,852
I won't shame you.
I understand.

349
00:51:24,886 --> 00:51:29,524
<i>Shai-Hulud</i> decides today if
you become Fremen, or if you die.

350
00:51:37,565 --> 00:51:38,666
Hey, <i>Muad'Dib!</i>

351
00:52:20,508 --> 00:52:21,509
Lower.

352
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:48,235
Okay. Okay.

353
00:53:59,907 --> 00:54:04,444
Okay. Okay. Okay.

354
00:54:52,026 --> 00:54:53,060
Okay.

355
00:55:10,678 --> 00:55:12,013
Okay. Okay!

356
00:55:36,904 --> 00:55:37,939
Come on!

357
00:55:48,883 --> 00:55:49,883
Whoa!

358
00:56:53,214 --> 00:56:54,515
You're a rider!

359
00:58:50,064 --> 00:58:52,600
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
I know they do.

360
00:58:55,336 --> 00:58:58,005
<i>Our task in the North
is nearly done.</i>

361
00:58:58,039 --> 00:58:59,774
<i>They believe in Paul.</i>

362
00:59:00,808 --> 00:59:03,044
<i>Now we go South.</i>

363
00:59:03,077 --> 00:59:06,747
<i>There are millions
of fundamentalists there.</i>

364
00:59:06,781 --> 00:59:09,116
<i>They will protect him
when he comes.</i>

365
00:59:11,786 --> 00:59:15,956
<i>The</i> Kwisatz Haderach
<i>will be born in the South.</i>

366
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:31,739
As long as I breathe.

367
00:59:36,177 --> 00:59:37,177
What's wrong?

368
00:59:43,217 --> 00:59:44,185
Chani.

369
00:59:44,218 --> 00:59:45,786
There will be trouble.

370
00:59:47,955 --> 00:59:49,223
What are you talking about?

371
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,662
Chani, what do you mean?

372
00:59:54,695 --> 00:59:56,030
The way they look at you.

373
00:59:57,398 --> 00:59:58,866
They worship you now.

374
01:00:01,769 --> 01:00:04,238
The Fedaykin,
they count your victories.

375
01:00:04,271 --> 01:00:06,874
They say you can see the future.

376
01:00:06,907 --> 01:00:08,676
Whisper, " <i>Lisan al-Gaib."</i>

377
01:00:09,944 --> 01:00:11,278
I'm no messiah.

378
01:00:14,048 --> 01:00:17,218
I'm a Fedaykin of Sietch Tabr.

379
01:00:17,251 --> 01:00:19,954
Yet, we have a Bene Gesserit
among us,

380
01:00:19,987 --> 01:00:21,322
fanning the flames
of your legend,

381
01:00:21,355 --> 01:00:22,890
saying you're the One.

382
01:00:44,345 --> 01:00:45,880
Mm.

383
01:00:50,317 --> 01:00:52,153
She says you should
be coming with us.

384
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,088
You know I can't.

385
01:00:54,989 --> 01:00:56,423
She's asking why.

386
01:00:56,457 --> 01:00:58,425
Because I must continue
fighting in the North,

387
01:00:58,459 --> 01:01:00,661
to protect you down
there in the South.

388
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:06,066
She says she can tell
when you lie.

389
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:09,403
Tell her that's because our mother
keeps spreading dangerous tales.

390
01:01:17,011 --> 01:01:18,812
What is she saying now?

391
01:01:18,846 --> 01:01:21,248
She says you're blinded by love,

392
01:01:21,282 --> 01:01:23,450
and she reminds you that
you must reserve your hand

393
01:01:23,484 --> 01:01:25,319
for the most strategic alliance.

394
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:31,325
She's also wondering why
you don't believe in who you are.

395
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:32,726
I do believe.

396
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,695
I believe I matter
to these people.

397
01:01:36,297 --> 01:01:38,299
And I believe I'm making
a difference in this war.

398
01:01:40,334 --> 01:01:42,069
We're nearly
at the gates of the city.

399
01:01:42,102 --> 01:01:44,972
- That's not what she means.
- I know what she means.

400
01:01:45,005 --> 01:01:47,341
Do you not think I also feel
the weight of the prophecy?

401
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:49,343
It's not a prophecy.

402
01:01:49,376 --> 01:01:51,078
It's a story that you
keep telling,

403
01:01:51,111 --> 01:01:53,147
but it's not their story,
it's yours.

404
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:56,383
They deserve to be led
by one of their own.

405
01:01:56,417 --> 01:01:59,119
What your people did
to this world is heartbreaking.

406
01:01:59,153 --> 01:02:00,821
We gave them something
to hope for.

407
01:02:00,854 --> 01:02:02,356
That's not hope!

408
01:02:16,538 --> 01:02:18,038
I'll be waiting for you.

409
01:02:19,473 --> 01:02:20,908
All of us.

410
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:22,910
<i>All of us.</i>

411
01:03:04,285 --> 01:03:06,920
Those storms look bad.

412
01:03:54,001 --> 01:03:55,637
- How much?
- We lost...

413
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:58,339
eighty percent of our last crop.

414
01:03:58,372 --> 01:04:02,242
My Lord Rabban, you should
not leave the security perimeter.

415
01:04:02,276 --> 01:04:04,878
Security perimeter?
The rats are already inside.

416
01:04:04,912 --> 01:04:06,548
The Fremen Demon
might be with them.

417
01:04:06,581 --> 01:04:08,282
I hope so.

418
01:04:08,315 --> 01:04:09,475
We're tracking them, my Lord.

419
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:12,953
Today, <i>Muad'Dib</i> dies!

420
01:04:54,529 --> 01:04:56,196
Where is he?

421
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:57,665
Still negative, my Lord.

422
01:04:57,699 --> 01:04:59,266
Why do I have to do
everything myself?

423
01:05:02,403 --> 01:05:03,470
Open range!

424
01:05:03,505 --> 01:05:05,005
Range open.

425
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,516
Life. Delta, delta, delta.

426
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:37,037
I've lost them.

427
01:05:42,443 --> 01:05:44,278
- Strike!
- Yes, my Lord.

428
01:06:50,845 --> 01:06:53,681
<i>Muad'Dib!</i>

429
01:06:53,715 --> 01:06:55,583
Show yourself!

430
01:07:26,446 --> 01:07:30,518
<i>Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!</i>

431
01:08:23,571 --> 01:08:25,707
For <i>Muad'Dib!</i>

432
01:08:38,352 --> 01:08:39,386
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

433
01:08:41,756 --> 01:08:45,760
Some new Fremen prophet?

434
01:08:45,793 --> 01:08:48,696
It's not the first time we've
had frictions with the Fremen.

435
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:50,531
None of this magnitude.

436
01:08:54,736 --> 01:08:56,336
So, my dear daughter...

437
01:08:57,605 --> 01:08:59,807
how would you deal
with this prophet?

438
01:09:06,213 --> 01:09:08,883
If this <i>Muad'Dib</i>
is a religious figure,

439
01:09:10,618 --> 01:09:12,386
you can't use direct force.

440
01:09:13,888 --> 01:09:17,324
Repression only makes
a religion flourish.

441
01:09:17,357 --> 01:09:19,426
You'll only end up
humiliating yourself.

442
01:09:19,459 --> 01:09:21,194
You underestimate my Sardaukar.

443
01:09:21,228 --> 01:09:23,898
You underestimate
the power of faith.

444
01:09:27,802 --> 01:09:31,371
Her Highness proves once again
that she was my most acute student.

445
01:09:33,641 --> 01:09:36,511
- You'd send assassins?
- No.

446
01:09:36,544 --> 01:09:38,311
Prophets get stronger
when they die.

447
01:09:39,981 --> 01:09:42,583
Let the conflict
on Arrakis turn into war.

448
01:09:42,617 --> 01:09:45,787
You then bring peace.
As a savior.

449
01:09:48,321 --> 01:09:50,257
You'd be a formidable empress.

450
01:09:54,595 --> 01:09:57,532
<i>Muad'Dib.</i> The prophet.

451
01:09:57,565 --> 01:10:00,233
The one who points the way.

452
01:10:00,267 --> 01:10:02,436
These are our own
religious patterns, aren't they?

453
01:10:02,469 --> 01:10:03,738
This is our doing.

454
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:10,444
<i>Muad'Dib</i> means kangaroo mouse.

455
01:10:10,477 --> 01:10:12,379
An unusual war name
for a Fremen.

456
01:10:14,582 --> 01:10:17,685
- What if Paul Atreides were still alive?
- -Enough!

457
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:21,856
This must not come out. Even
to your father's ears. Understand?

458
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:25,727
I do, Reverend Mother.

459
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,996
If Paul is alive,
he likely knows the truth.

460
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:30,965
And should
the Great Houses learn

461
01:10:30,998 --> 01:10:34,334
that your father was behind
the liquidation of the Atreides,

462
01:10:34,367 --> 01:10:37,705
your father will face war
and lose the throne.

463
01:10:39,674 --> 01:10:41,008
Then what hope is there?

464
01:10:42,543 --> 01:10:43,543
Hope?

465
01:10:44,879 --> 01:10:49,016
We are Bene Gesserit.
We don't hope, we plan.

466
01:10:50,383 --> 01:10:54,354
Paul is not our only prospect.

467
01:10:54,387 --> 01:10:59,392
The Baron's youngest nephew, Feyd-Rautha
Harkonnen, will inherit Arrakis.

468
01:11:00,928 --> 01:11:02,462
He may be the answer.

469
01:11:02,496 --> 01:11:05,032
Feyd-Rautha? He's psychotic.

470
01:11:05,066 --> 01:11:07,001
That's irrelevant.

471
01:11:07,034 --> 01:11:11,371
The question is,
can we control him?

472
01:11:11,404 --> 01:11:12,807
And I intend to find out.

473
01:11:36,130 --> 01:11:38,699
Would you like some fresh meat,
my darlings?

474
01:11:39,734 --> 01:11:42,870
Lungs? Or liver?

475
01:11:42,904 --> 01:11:45,973
What would you like?
I hear they're big today.

476
01:11:46,007 --> 01:11:50,477
Your new blades
for this very special day,

477
01:11:50,511 --> 01:11:53,346
na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha.

478
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:23,711
A notch off balance.

479
01:12:23,744 --> 01:12:24,744
It's the tip.

480
01:12:25,546 --> 01:12:26,981
Should be sharper.

481
01:12:41,195 --> 01:12:42,797
Come.

482
01:12:42,830 --> 01:12:44,866
I won't die like a fool.

483
01:12:44,899 --> 01:12:46,033
Kill me now.

484
01:12:46,067 --> 01:12:48,836
No drug for you today, Atreides.

485
01:14:04,178 --> 01:14:06,213
Welcome to Giedi Prime, sisters.

486
01:14:06,247 --> 01:14:08,516
I hope your travels
were agreeable.

487
01:14:08,549 --> 01:14:10,785
A long way to come
just to watch our prospect

488
01:14:10,818 --> 01:14:12,753
risk his life, Lady Fenring.

489
01:14:12,787 --> 01:14:14,822
No fear.

490
01:14:14,855 --> 01:14:16,557
These fights are all for show.

491
01:14:18,025 --> 01:14:20,628
But we'll get
a good look at him.

492
01:14:42,683 --> 01:14:46,587
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

493
01:16:00,961 --> 01:16:01,961
That slave isn't drugged.

494
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:04,765
That bug is walking straight.

495
01:16:06,033 --> 01:16:07,268
You should cancel the fight.

496
01:16:07,301 --> 01:16:10,137
Don't spoil
my nephew's birthday.

497
01:16:57,751 --> 01:17:00,654
Happy birthday, dear nephew.

498
01:17:17,071 --> 01:17:19,039
Why do they not stop the fight?

499
01:17:19,073 --> 01:17:20,941
Plans within plans.

500
01:17:25,746 --> 01:17:27,148
Show me who you are.

501
01:17:44,131 --> 01:17:45,699
There he is.

502
01:18:30,277 --> 01:18:32,079
Back! Back!

503
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:51,165
Stay back!

504
01:19:04,945 --> 01:19:07,181
You have fought well, Atreides.

505
01:19:08,282 --> 01:19:09,551
Hmm.

506
01:19:18,959 --> 01:19:23,297
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

507
01:19:28,936 --> 01:19:30,304
He's impressive, indeed.

508
01:19:30,337 --> 01:19:34,208
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

509
01:19:42,182 --> 01:19:43,817
The slave wasn't drugged.

510
01:19:46,186 --> 01:19:48,822
You tried to kill me.

511
01:19:48,856 --> 01:19:51,225
This morning you were a playboy,

512
01:19:51,258 --> 01:19:53,160
feared and envied,

513
01:19:53,193 --> 01:19:56,497
but tonight you're a hero.

514
01:19:56,531 --> 01:19:58,265
My gift to you.

515
01:19:58,299 --> 01:20:00,301
I ought to drown you
in that tub.

516
01:20:01,869 --> 01:20:04,071
Don't be hasty.

517
01:20:04,104 --> 01:20:06,541
I have another gift for you.

518
01:20:06,574 --> 01:20:07,941
A bigger one.

519
01:20:09,443 --> 01:20:11,211
Arrakis.

520
01:20:14,982 --> 01:20:16,850
What about Rabban?

521
01:20:16,884 --> 01:20:19,153
He has failed
to protect spice production.

522
01:20:19,186 --> 01:20:21,355
Rabban will be reassigned.

523
01:20:25,326 --> 01:20:28,228
Tame Arrakis, Feyd.

524
01:20:28,262 --> 01:20:30,864
Free the spice.
I'll make you Emperor.

525
01:20:43,177 --> 01:20:45,012
Emperor?

526
01:20:48,215 --> 01:20:49,215
How?

527
01:20:51,318 --> 01:20:54,254
The Emperor helped me
destroy the Atreides.

528
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:58,359
He lent his own army
to the cause.

529
01:20:58,392 --> 01:21:00,928
A serious crime.

530
01:21:00,961 --> 01:21:05,165
If it came to light, the Great
Houses would rise against him.

531
01:21:05,999 --> 01:21:07,201
And then...

532
01:21:08,469 --> 01:21:10,904
who will sit on the throne?

533
01:21:11,673 --> 01:21:14,908
Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.

534
01:21:55,149 --> 01:21:56,283
You're following me.

535
01:21:57,652 --> 01:21:58,686
Am I?

536
01:22:00,655 --> 01:22:02,189
I may have gotten lost.

537
01:22:04,358 --> 01:22:09,062
Will you show me the way out
of this maze, my Lord na-Baron?

538
01:22:16,303 --> 01:22:18,472
We've met, haven't we?

539
01:22:21,743 --> 01:22:23,043
I don't think so.

540
01:22:24,011 --> 01:22:26,413
I'm Lady Margot Fenring.

541
01:22:26,447 --> 01:22:28,750
I'm here to honor
your coming of age.

542
01:22:28,783 --> 01:22:30,552
You're not allowed
in this section.

543
01:22:31,686 --> 01:22:33,287
How did you get past the guards?

544
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:34,522
The guards?

545
01:22:37,491 --> 01:22:39,393
May I ask,
what are you doing here?

546
01:22:41,663 --> 01:22:45,098
You're not taking part
in your own celebrations?

547
01:22:55,442 --> 01:22:58,278
You're Bene Gesserit.

548
01:22:58,312 --> 01:23:01,181
And what makes you say that?

549
01:23:01,215 --> 01:23:03,685
I remember now.

550
01:23:03,718 --> 01:23:06,420
I dreamed about you last night.

551
01:23:06,453 --> 01:23:08,155
<i>A pleasant dream, I hope.</i>

552
01:23:08,188 --> 01:23:09,691
Don't mock me, woman.

553
01:23:09,724 --> 01:23:11,058
<i>I wouldn't dare.</i>

554
01:23:13,393 --> 01:23:16,396
I know your
Bene Gesserit tricks.

555
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:18,700
And what do you know
about the Bene Gesserit?

556
01:23:22,604 --> 01:23:23,604
Tell me.

557
01:23:27,709 --> 01:23:29,309
Something wrong?

558
01:23:29,343 --> 01:23:30,645
I don't recognize this place.

559
01:23:31,846 --> 01:23:33,515
This is the guest wing.

560
01:23:36,383 --> 01:23:37,484
Where are you going?

561
01:23:39,386 --> 01:23:40,386
To my room.

562
01:24:07,582 --> 01:24:13,053
Come. To. Me.

563
01:24:16,356 --> 01:24:17,457
Kneel.

564
01:24:31,606 --> 01:24:34,474
Put your right hand in the box.

565
01:24:49,691 --> 01:24:53,126
A sociopath.
Of high intelligence.

566
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,162
Driven. Cruel.

567
01:24:55,195 --> 01:24:57,264
But strongly motivated by honor.

568
01:24:58,398 --> 01:25:00,535
He yearns to be hurt.

569
01:25:00,568 --> 01:25:02,502
He loves pain.

570
01:25:02,537 --> 01:25:04,137
Can he be redeemed?

571
01:25:04,171 --> 01:25:05,640
He can be controlled.

572
01:25:05,673 --> 01:25:07,441
He's sexually vulnerable.

573
01:25:09,611 --> 01:25:10,611
And?

574
01:25:11,946 --> 01:25:13,615
The bloodline is secured.

575
01:25:15,382 --> 01:25:18,218
Female, as you requested.

576
01:25:19,252 --> 01:25:21,589
You did well, Margot.

577
01:25:21,623 --> 01:25:24,826
Respectfully, why didn't you
test him yourself?

578
01:25:26,293 --> 01:25:28,730
I'm a motherly figure.

579
01:25:28,763 --> 01:25:32,366
And based on what happened
between him and his own mother,

580
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:34,936
I didn't expect to be effective.

581
01:25:34,969 --> 01:25:36,571
What happened between
him and his mother?

582
01:25:37,371 --> 01:25:38,371
He murdered her.

583
01:25:39,674 --> 01:25:42,644
Desire and humiliation.

584
01:25:43,911 --> 01:25:46,514
Those are his levers.

585
01:25:46,547 --> 01:25:48,916
If Feyd-Rautha
prevails on Arrakis,

586
01:25:48,950 --> 01:25:51,653
we shall know
how to control him.

587
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:14,842
Rid me of this Fremen Demon.

588
01:26:29,891 --> 01:26:33,493
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

589
01:26:33,528 --> 01:26:37,832
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

590
01:26:37,865 --> 01:26:39,534
Feyd-Rautha!

591

Juicy?

599
01:27:28,883 --> 01:27:30,718
Juicy, juicy.

600
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:35,022
Well, it was nice knowing ya.

601
01:27:35,056 --> 01:27:36,557
Oh, yeah?

602
01:27:36,591 --> 01:27:38,325
Radar's clear. We're clear.

603
01:27:39,727 --> 01:27:41,229
Cooking time.

604
01:28:01,048 --> 01:28:02,817
Juicy, juicy.

605
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:04,819
Yeah, I got a meter reading...

606
01:28:04,852 --> 01:28:06,854
All right, guys,
worms are on their way.

607
01:28:06,888 --> 01:28:07,965
- Watch out for abrasions.
- -Get ready to dock.

608
01:28:07,989 --> 01:28:09,356
It's gonna get hot.

609
01:28:13,493 --> 01:28:15,428
Crank 'em up!
Throw them up!

610
01:28:44,158 --> 01:28:45,158
Hold!

611
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:01,008
Mine! Mine!

612
01:29:01,042 --> 01:29:02,777
Get moving!

613
01:29:06,814 --> 01:29:09,050
- East! East!
- Get clear!

614
01:29:15,690 --> 01:29:17,625
Let's get out of here!

615
01:29:17,658 --> 01:29:19,026
Incoming!

616
01:29:22,462 --> 01:29:24,098
Don't run, fight!

617
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:27,869
We're in deep Fremen shit.

618
01:29:29,937 --> 01:29:31,438
Holy Mother.

619
01:29:42,617 --> 01:29:43,751
Oh, fuck.

620
01:30:00,735 --> 01:30:03,571
I recognized your footsteps...

621
01:30:03,604 --> 01:30:05,172
- old man.
- No.

622
01:30:29,563 --> 01:30:31,666
You young pup.

623
01:30:32,233 --> 01:30:34,101
You young pup!

624
01:30:41,175 --> 01:30:43,911
Mmm.
After the Battle of Arrakeen,

625
01:30:43,945 --> 01:30:47,447
I was able to negotiate a trip
back home for the survivors.

626
01:30:48,683 --> 01:30:50,718
Thanks to these guys.

627
01:30:50,751 --> 01:30:51,953
Why'd you stay?

628
01:30:52,987 --> 01:30:54,454
Well, I wanted blood.

629
01:30:56,657 --> 01:30:57,758
Rabban's head?

630
01:30:58,893 --> 01:31:00,861
Mm-hmm.

631
01:31:00,895 --> 01:31:03,998
Well, since <i>Muad'Dib's</i>
been driving Rabban crazy,

632
01:31:04,031 --> 01:31:08,903
the smuggling business
has been quite profitable.

633
01:31:08,936 --> 01:31:10,738
Gurney Halleck the smuggler.

634
01:31:12,907 --> 01:31:15,242
Paul <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

635
01:31:15,276 --> 01:31:17,979
I've heard many stories
about <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

636
01:31:19,080 --> 01:31:20,648
None of them pretty.

637
01:31:21,882 --> 01:31:23,184
You see the fear?

638
01:31:24,986 --> 01:31:26,821
When our resources
are limited...

639
01:31:29,623 --> 01:31:31,125
fear is all we have.

640
01:31:48,843 --> 01:31:50,311
How many men with you?

641
01:31:50,344 --> 01:31:52,546
- Two hundred.
- Two hundred?

642
01:31:57,118 --> 01:32:00,054
Do you realize what you're able
to achieve with 200 men?

643
01:32:01,355 --> 01:32:03,090
Incredible fighters.

644
01:32:03,124 --> 01:32:04,668
Duncan said there
were millions of them.

645
01:32:04,692 --> 01:32:06,293
In the Deep South, yes.

646
01:32:06,327 --> 01:32:08,763
Well, what are you waiting for?

647
01:32:08,796 --> 01:32:11,999
With thousands of these guys, you
could take control of the entire planet.

648
01:32:12,033 --> 01:32:14,068
It's your father's dream.
What are you afraid of?

649
01:32:14,101 --> 01:32:15,102
Hey!

650
01:32:17,204 --> 01:32:18,906
Worship, Gurney.

651
01:32:20,207 --> 01:32:21,542
They used to be friends.

652
01:32:23,177 --> 01:32:24,612
Now they're followers.

653
01:32:24,645 --> 01:32:26,714
<i>Muad'Dib,</i> the Prophet.

654
01:32:26,747 --> 01:32:28,682
Why is that a bad thing?
Use it.

655
01:32:28,716 --> 01:32:30,851
It's not that simple.

656
01:32:30,885 --> 01:32:33,687
You have the power to avenge
your father, and you're afraid to use it?

657
01:32:33,721 --> 01:32:35,723
Spice opened my mind, Gurney.

658
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:38,025
I can foresee things.

659
01:32:40,027 --> 01:32:43,964
If I go South, all my visions
lead to horror.

660
01:32:43,998 --> 01:32:47,301
Billions of corpses
scattered across the galaxy.

661
01:32:47,334 --> 01:32:48,836
All dying because of me.

662
01:32:49,870 --> 01:32:51,005
Because you lose control.

663
01:32:53,074 --> 01:32:54,141
Because I gain it.

664
01:33:13,027 --> 01:33:14,195
That's a lot of water.

665
01:33:16,964 --> 01:33:18,299
Chani.

666
01:33:18,332 --> 01:33:20,034
What?
Look at him, he's hopeless.

667
01:33:20,901 --> 01:33:21,901
He's family.

668
01:33:25,306 --> 01:33:26,307
Really?

669
01:33:54,368 --> 01:33:56,871
No need to be a prophet
to see what's ahead.

670
01:33:59,807 --> 01:34:01,142
Your path leads to war.

671
01:34:02,910 --> 01:34:03,978
You know that.

672
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:08,749
So, war is coming.

673
01:34:08,782 --> 01:34:12,353
What will you do when you feel
its breath upon your neck?

674
01:34:16,090 --> 01:34:18,359
If you don't want to raise
an army in the South,

675
01:34:18,392 --> 01:34:20,027
you may still have an option.

676
01:34:23,364 --> 01:34:24,398
Fire power...

677
01:34:26,133 --> 01:34:27,801
which you don't have.

678
01:34:29,970 --> 01:34:30,970
And here I am.

679
01:34:35,409 --> 01:34:37,945
I know where your father
hid the family atomics.

680
01:34:43,350 --> 01:34:46,153
Every House possesses
an atomic arsenal.

681
01:34:47,522 --> 01:34:49,456
I thought ours had been lost.

682
01:34:51,926 --> 01:34:54,295
It's huge, Chani.
It could change everything.

683
01:34:59,767 --> 01:35:02,937
I could aim the bombs
at the main spice fields.

684
01:35:04,905 --> 01:35:08,108
He who can destroy a thing
has the real control of it.

685
01:35:09,843 --> 01:35:11,278
So, you can control it
and not us?

686
01:35:13,548 --> 01:35:15,349
You promised me
you didn't want power.

687
01:35:17,251 --> 01:35:19,253
No matter what I do,
you still don't trust me.

688
01:35:19,286 --> 01:35:22,056
'Cause you're a foreigner.
Like your friend.

689
01:35:24,391 --> 01:35:25,993
I'm not a foreigner.

690
01:35:33,801 --> 01:35:35,069
Not to me.

691
01:35:35,102 --> 01:35:36,770
But to the desert, you are.

692
01:35:37,871 --> 01:35:39,873
My allegiance is to you.

693
01:35:40,542 --> 01:35:41,942
To the Fremen.

694
01:35:41,976 --> 01:35:43,777
I'm doing this for all of us.

695
01:35:45,246 --> 01:35:46,246
Do you believe me?

696
01:35:54,855 --> 01:35:55,923
I'll talk to Stilgar.

697
01:36:04,031 --> 01:36:05,032
There.

698
01:36:09,270 --> 01:36:12,473
It's right under
everybody's noses.

699
01:36:13,941 --> 01:36:15,209
Not clever.

700
01:36:15,242 --> 01:36:17,011
That's the idea.

701
01:36:17,044 --> 01:36:19,246
Nobody would ever look in there
because it's obvious.

702
01:36:21,915 --> 01:36:23,884
Not clever.

703
01:36:23,917 --> 01:36:25,386
Did you find it?

704
01:36:25,419 --> 01:36:27,589
I didn't look for it.

705
01:36:27,622 --> 01:36:29,089
How many heads exactly?

706
01:36:30,958 --> 01:36:32,893
Enough to blow up
the whole planet.

707
01:36:35,963 --> 01:36:37,331
It's a figure of speech.

708
01:36:39,233 --> 01:36:40,267
You know what I mean.

709
01:37:03,023 --> 01:37:04,958
Only with your genetic heritage.

710
01:37:44,632 --> 01:37:48,335
Your great-great-grandfather's
legacy.

711
01:37:48,369 --> 01:37:52,072
The 92 original Atreides
family's atomic warheads.

712
01:37:55,008 --> 01:37:58,178
Now that, that is power.

713
01:38:05,052 --> 01:38:09,256
Imperial Diary. Year 10,191.

714
01:38:09,289 --> 01:38:11,559
Eighth comment.

715
01:38:11,593 --> 01:38:15,462
Reports from the south
of Arrakis arrive rarely.

716
01:38:15,496 --> 01:38:19,199
<i>These are barren, burnt lands
hidden by sandstorms</i>

717
01:38:19,233 --> 01:38:21,502
<i>which stretch a thousand miles
across the equator.</i>

718
01:38:23,504 --> 01:38:27,441
<i>Nothing can live there
without faith.</i>

719
01:38:27,474 --> 01:38:31,546
<i>Which is why our Bene Gesserit
missionaries have been so productive there.</i>

720
01:38:35,082 --> 01:38:38,051
<i>Through them, we are receiving
reports of a mysterious figure</i>

721
01:38:38,085 --> 01:38:39,953
<i>taking grip on the imaginations</i>

722
01:38:39,987 --> 01:38:43,357
<i>of the Southern
fundamentalist tribes.</i>

723
01:38:43,390 --> 01:38:47,027
<i>A new Reverend Mother
from the North...</i>

724
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:51,165
<i>spreading word of the imminent
arrival of the</i> Lisan al-Gaib,

725
01:38:51,198 --> 01:38:54,268
<i>"The Voice
from the Outer World."</i>

726
01:38:54,301 --> 01:38:57,572
<i>With religious fervor
rising in the South,</i>

727
01:38:57,605 --> 01:39:01,408
<i>and</i> Muad'Dib <i>strangling
spice production in the North,</i>

728
01:39:01,442 --> 01:39:04,945
<i>everything points
to the escalation of war.</i>

729
01:39:24,699 --> 01:39:25,699
Hmm.

730
01:39:35,342 --> 01:39:36,342
Quiet.

731
01:41:25,252 --> 01:41:26,854
Listen carefully.

732
01:41:26,888 --> 01:41:28,590
Soon a man
is going to visit your temple

733
01:41:28,623 --> 01:41:31,358
and he may want
you to perform the rites.

734
01:41:31,391 --> 01:41:34,328
Reverend Mother,
it is forbidden.

735
01:41:39,667 --> 01:41:41,501
Let him try!

736
01:42:25,613 --> 01:42:26,781
What the hell?

737
01:42:30,384 --> 01:42:31,619
Chani!

738
01:42:37,592 --> 01:42:38,893
Chani!

739
01:42:42,964 --> 01:42:44,231
Chani.

740
01:42:53,908 --> 01:42:55,610
Sietch Tabr.

741
01:43:19,901 --> 01:43:21,602
Old fashioned artillery.

742
01:43:22,737 --> 01:43:24,672
Genius.

743
01:43:24,706 --> 01:43:27,542
We're literally melting rock
on their heads.

744
01:43:27,575 --> 01:43:30,611
I want to go on the ground.
Prepare my troops.

745
01:43:30,645 --> 01:43:33,815
My Lord. I would recommend
you stay inside. There was...

746
01:43:33,848 --> 01:43:35,783
Bring his body to my quarters.

747
01:43:36,951 --> 01:43:39,286
My poor darlings are hungry.

748
01:43:39,319 --> 01:43:40,988
There was no food
for them on the flight.

749
01:43:42,590 --> 01:43:45,026
What are you doing here?

750
01:43:45,059 --> 01:43:48,295
It's early morning.
What are you doing here?

751
01:43:48,328 --> 01:43:49,997
Kiss my feet, brother.

752
01:43:50,031 --> 01:43:51,298
I'm gonna eviscerate your...

753
01:43:57,304 --> 01:43:59,774
You humiliated our family.

754
01:44:00,908 --> 01:44:02,677
You humiliated me.

755
01:44:03,678 --> 01:44:05,046
Kiss...

756
01:44:05,079 --> 01:44:06,881
or die.

757
01:44:17,357 --> 01:44:18,458
We're even now.

758
01:44:24,632 --> 01:44:27,267
Embarrass our family
one more time...

759
01:44:28,536 --> 01:44:29,704
it will be the last.

760
01:45:04,672 --> 01:45:07,108
They didn't even
engage on the ground,

761
01:45:07,141 --> 01:45:09,510
like honorable fighters.

762
01:45:41,843 --> 01:45:44,879
<i>Usul,</i> in the South...

763
01:45:44,912 --> 01:45:47,414
only leaders
are allowed to speak.

764
01:45:48,716 --> 01:45:51,586
- You must take my place.
- I can't do that.

765
01:45:51,619 --> 01:45:54,522
It is a good time
to cross blades with me.

766
01:45:54,555 --> 01:45:57,859
I am weak.
I am an easy kill, <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

767
01:45:57,892 --> 01:45:59,861
I'd rather cut off my own hand.

768
01:45:59,894 --> 01:46:02,630
We need you. We need the
<i>Lisan al-Gaib</i> to lead our people.

769
01:46:02,663 --> 01:46:04,599
You know what I think
of all that, Stilgar.

770
01:46:04,632 --> 01:46:07,034
I don't care what you believe.
I believe.

771
01:46:21,616 --> 01:46:22,884
I didn't see it coming.

772
01:46:24,785 --> 01:46:26,520
The Harkonnens aren't done here.

773
01:46:27,622 --> 01:46:29,757
They just went back to reload.

774
01:46:29,790 --> 01:46:31,659
We're setting thumpers.

775
01:46:31,692 --> 01:46:33,036
We're moving everyone
to the South.

776
01:46:33,060 --> 01:46:34,962
I'll stay behind
and cover your retreat.

777
01:46:34,996 --> 01:46:37,430
- What are you talking about?
- Chani, I can't go with you.

778
01:46:38,099 --> 01:46:39,700
You know why.

779
01:46:39,734 --> 01:46:41,736
- I'll stay, too.
- Nobody stays but me.

780
01:46:41,769 --> 01:46:44,205
- Paul.
- That's an order, Gurney Halleck! Go South!

781
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:45,606
Protect my mother.

782
01:46:48,042 --> 01:46:49,176
- My Lord.
<i>- Muad'Dib.</i>

783
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:01,055
He's afraid
of the fundamentalists.

784
01:47:02,590 --> 01:47:03,591
And he should be.

785
01:47:17,038 --> 01:47:18,438
<i>Don't resist.</i>

786
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:27,148
Talk to me, Jamis.

787
01:47:38,025 --> 01:47:42,196
<i>You see only fragments.</i>

788
01:47:42,229 --> 01:47:46,167
<i>You cannot see the future
without seeing the past.</i>

789
01:47:48,536 --> 01:47:52,974
<i>To unlock your mind, you
need to drink the Water of Life...</i>

790
01:47:53,007 --> 01:47:55,943
<i>and you will see everything.</i>

791
01:47:59,647 --> 01:48:03,050
<i>A good hunter always climbs
the highest dune before his hunt.</i>

792
01:48:04,652 --> 01:48:05,820
<i>He needs to see...</i>

793
01:48:07,788 --> 01:48:09,256
<i>as far as he can see.</i>

794
01:48:14,662 --> 01:48:15,796
You need to see.

795
01:48:18,666 --> 01:48:20,701
<i>You must drink
the Water of Life.</i>

796
01:48:22,003 --> 01:48:23,704
<i>Your mind, it's gonna open,</i>

797
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:27,641
<i>and you will see.</i>

798
01:48:46,027 --> 01:48:47,962
The world has made
choices for us.

799
01:48:53,067 --> 01:48:54,835
If I go South, I might lose you.

800
01:48:54,869 --> 01:48:56,637
You will never lose me,

801
01:48:57,938 --> 01:48:59,106
Paul Atreides.

802
01:49:01,008 --> 01:49:03,310
Not as long
as you stay who you are.

803
01:49:10,918 --> 01:49:12,920
I'll cross the storms with you.

804
01:49:12,953 --> 01:49:14,221
Go South.

805
01:49:15,623 --> 01:49:17,091
Bring your people to safety.

806
01:49:23,230 --> 01:49:25,933
And then I will do
what must be done.

807
01:49:50,091 --> 01:49:51,258
Where?

808
01:49:51,292 --> 01:49:53,861
Spy. Left behind.

809
01:49:53,894 --> 01:49:55,796
No trace of the others.

810
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:58,299
They've gone South
to hide in the storms.

811
01:50:03,137 --> 01:50:04,872
Send this message to the Baron.

812
01:50:04,905 --> 01:50:07,208
The North is liberated
and secured.

813
01:50:07,241 --> 01:50:09,777
Harvest spice at will.

814
01:50:09,810 --> 01:50:11,145
Yes, na-Baron.

815
01:50:25,893 --> 01:50:29,263
You killed nine of my men
with one single blade.

816
01:50:30,831 --> 01:50:32,666
She won't talk.

817
01:50:32,700 --> 01:50:34,668
Tell her that's fine.

818
01:50:34,702 --> 01:50:36,937
I already know
everything I need to know.

819
01:50:44,945 --> 01:50:46,780
Only pleasure remains.

820
01:52:52,139 --> 01:52:56,043
<i>Now that you can see our past,</i>

821
01:52:59,313 --> 01:53:02,383
<i>you can see your future.</i>

822
01:53:23,404 --> 01:53:27,274
<i>Oh, brother, my dearest brother,</i>

823
01:53:27,308 --> 01:53:30,110
<i>you are not prepared
for what is to come.</i>

824
01:53:31,945 --> 01:53:35,249
<i>You'll now learn the truth
about our family.</i>

825
01:53:35,282 --> 01:53:38,852
<i>And it will hurt you
to the core.</i>

826
01:53:40,387 --> 01:53:42,356
Paul...

827
01:53:42,389 --> 01:53:45,459
<i>Don't worry. I'm with you.</i>

828
01:53:46,994 --> 01:53:48,362
I love you.

829
01:54:01,509 --> 01:54:02,910
Find them.

830
01:54:32,339 --> 01:54:33,340
Paul?

831
01:54:34,108 --> 01:54:35,142
Paul.

832
01:54:37,378 --> 01:54:39,980
I'm here. I'm here. Hey.

833
01:54:43,384 --> 01:54:44,652
What happened?

834
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:47,522
What happened?

835
01:54:58,165 --> 01:54:59,701
He's dead.

836
01:54:59,734 --> 01:55:02,469
His vital signs are so low,
they can't be detected.

837
01:55:02,503 --> 01:55:03,971
But he's alive.

838
01:55:04,004 --> 01:55:05,506
What did you do to him?

839
01:55:06,974 --> 01:55:09,076
No, not that.
Why would he do that?

840
01:55:09,109 --> 01:55:10,177
Why would you do that?

841
01:55:19,253 --> 01:55:22,657
Chani, his body is fighting the
poison and he needs your help.

842
01:55:22,690 --> 01:55:24,091
You do it.

843
01:55:25,259 --> 01:55:26,360
You did this to him.

844
01:55:26,393 --> 01:55:28,061
You did this to your own son!

845
01:55:28,095 --> 01:55:29,163
You do it!

846
01:55:29,196 --> 01:55:31,198
Fix it yourself.

847
01:55:31,231 --> 01:55:34,602
Chani, you might not believe in
the prophecy, but you're a part of it.

848
01:55:34,636 --> 01:55:36,336
You're the poison.

849
01:55:36,370 --> 01:55:39,072
You and your lies.
Why would you do this?

850
01:55:39,106 --> 01:55:40,274
Do it.

851
01:56:04,799 --> 01:56:06,233
Desert Spring tears.

852
01:56:30,525 --> 01:56:33,761
<i>Kwisatz Haderach,</i>

853
01:56:33,795 --> 01:56:37,732
<i>climb up. Arise.</i>

854
01:56:47,407 --> 01:56:49,209
<i>Usul,</i> I'm here. I'm here.

855
01:56:58,553 --> 01:57:00,254
Are you okay?

856
01:57:00,287 --> 01:57:01,288
Yes.

857
01:57:10,397 --> 01:57:11,533
Are you sure?

858
01:57:15,603 --> 01:57:17,037
Thanks to you.

859
01:58:02,684 --> 01:58:04,284
I'm sorry about Chani.

860
01:58:05,787 --> 01:58:07,689
She'll come to understand.

861
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:09,824
I've seen it.

862
01:58:11,458 --> 01:58:13,427
You can see?

863
01:58:13,460 --> 01:58:15,730
The visions are clear now.

864
01:58:17,899 --> 01:58:21,703
I see possible futures.
All at once.

865
01:58:22,870 --> 01:58:26,406
Our enemies are all around us.

866
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:28,776
And in so many futures,
they prevail.

867
01:58:29,711 --> 01:58:31,579
But I do see a way.

868
01:58:32,780 --> 01:58:35,182
There is a narrow way through.

869
01:58:45,459 --> 01:58:47,294
I saw our bloodline, Mother.

870
01:58:48,563 --> 01:58:49,897
Written across time.

871
01:59:02,577 --> 01:59:05,379
<i>You are the daughter
of Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.</i>

872
01:59:08,281 --> 01:59:09,684
Did my father know?

873
01:59:15,723 --> 01:59:18,893
I didn't know myself,
until I took the worm's poison.

874
01:59:26,768 --> 01:59:28,402
We're Harkonnens.

875
01:59:32,472 --> 01:59:34,542
So this is how we'll survive.

876
01:59:36,309 --> 01:59:37,745
By being Harkonnens.

877
02:01:14,776 --> 02:01:15,810
We must talk.

878
02:01:17,845 --> 02:01:20,748
Stilgar, you can stop this.
Do you hear me?

879
02:01:20,782 --> 02:01:22,482
You have the power to stop this.

880
02:01:22,517 --> 02:01:23,985
Northern woman!

881
02:01:24,018 --> 02:01:25,887
You are not allowed
to speak inside the circle.

882
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:27,588
If you want to speak,
you know what to do.

883
02:01:27,622 --> 02:01:30,825
Stilgar, please.
For Arrakis' sake.

884
02:01:43,538 --> 02:01:46,473
This prophecy
is how they enslave us!

885
02:01:46,506 --> 02:01:48,609
How they dominate...

886
02:01:48,643 --> 02:01:50,443
You'll get yourself in trouble.

887
02:01:50,477 --> 02:01:51,913
This is none of your business.

888
02:01:51,946 --> 02:01:53,948
Rabban Harkonnen himself
killed my family.

889
02:01:53,981 --> 02:01:55,950
He gave me this scar
to remember him by.

890
02:01:55,983 --> 02:01:58,019
This is all of my business.

891
02:02:45,032 --> 02:02:47,134
Only tribe leaders can speak.

892
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:49,469
If you wish to share your voice,

893
02:02:49,502 --> 02:02:52,439
you must take his place
by defeating him

894
02:02:52,472 --> 02:02:54,876
and returning his water
to the well.

895
02:02:54,909 --> 02:02:58,478
You think I'm stupid enough to
deprive myself of the best of us?

896
02:03:02,717 --> 02:03:04,852
Take my life, <i>Usul.</i>

897
02:03:04,886 --> 02:03:06,921
It is the only way.

898
02:03:06,954 --> 02:03:08,890
I'm pointing the way!

899
02:03:11,092 --> 02:03:12,627
Slow down.

900
02:03:48,195 --> 02:03:50,430
But you think
you could have a chance.

901
02:04:34,308 --> 02:04:35,943
Dune.

902
02:04:35,977 --> 02:04:37,611
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

903
02:04:37,645 --> 02:04:39,914
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

904
02:04:41,215 --> 02:04:42,650
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

905
02:04:53,828 --> 02:04:54,895
<i>Muad'Dib!</i>

906
02:04:54,929 --> 02:04:56,797
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

907
02:05:21,155 --> 02:05:23,224
This is my father's
ducal signet.

908
02:05:33,601 --> 02:05:36,203
I am Paul <i>Muad'Dib</i> Atreides,

909
02:05:36,237 --> 02:05:38,072
Duke of Arrakis.

910
02:05:47,348 --> 02:05:49,083
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

911
02:05:49,116 --> 02:05:51,218
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

912
02:05:51,252 --> 02:05:55,589
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

913
02:05:55,623 --> 02:05:58,325
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

914
02:05:58,359 --> 02:06:01,328
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

915
02:06:01,362 --> 02:06:04,632
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

916
02:06:04,665 --> 02:06:07,835
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

917
02:06:07,868 --> 02:06:09,303
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

918
02:06:46,841 --> 02:06:49,110
Paul Atreides is still alive.

919
02:06:50,878 --> 02:06:52,379
He challenges my father.

920
02:06:53,848 --> 02:06:55,616
You've never been on Arrakis.

921
02:06:57,084 --> 02:06:59,086
It's quite impressive.
You'll see.

922
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:00,721
Was this all upon your advice?

923
02:07:00,754 --> 02:07:02,790
What?

924
02:07:02,823 --> 02:07:05,860
Did you counsel my father
to exterminate the Atreides?

925
02:07:05,893 --> 02:07:09,230
Of course I did. Why else
would it have happened?

926
02:07:09,263 --> 02:07:11,699
You tried to sacrifice
an entire bloodline.

927
02:07:11,732 --> 02:07:13,801
And I was right to do it.

928
02:07:13,834 --> 02:07:16,971
The <i>Kwisatz Haderach</i>
is a form of power

929
02:07:17,004 --> 02:07:19,240
that our world has not yet seen.

930
02:07:19,273 --> 02:07:21,876
The ultimate power.

931
02:07:21,909 --> 02:07:23,744
For ninety generations,

932
02:07:23,777 --> 02:07:25,813
we have supervised
House Atreides.

933
02:07:25,846 --> 02:07:28,916
They were promising, but they
were becoming dangerously defiant.

934
02:07:28,949 --> 02:07:32,386
Their bloodline
had to be terminated.

935
02:07:32,419 --> 02:07:34,889
That is why we have put
many bloodlines at work.

936
02:07:34,922 --> 02:07:35,956
Several prospects.

937
02:07:35,990 --> 02:07:37,424
But it's backfired.

938
02:07:37,458 --> 02:07:39,160
Paul is alive.

939
02:07:39,193 --> 02:07:41,128
And if he defeats
Feyd-Rautha, my father...

940
02:07:41,162 --> 02:07:45,366
Your father will lose the
throne no matter who prevails.

941
02:07:45,399 --> 02:07:48,402
But there is one way your
family can remain in power

942
02:07:48,435 --> 02:07:51,872
and, through you, the
continuation of our stewardship.

943
02:07:52,973 --> 02:07:54,842
One. Way.

944
02:07:55,442 --> 02:07:57,945
Are you prepared?

945
02:07:57,978 --> 02:08:00,681
You've been preparing me
my whole life, Reverend Mother.

946
02:08:02,983 --> 02:08:05,286
You're heading north
with the others?

947
02:08:05,319 --> 02:08:07,254
I'm Fedaykin.

948
02:08:07,288 --> 02:08:09,990
I follow my leaders. If
fighting goes north, I go north.

949
02:08:10,024 --> 02:08:11,392
Paul didn't have
a choice, Chani.

950
02:08:11,425 --> 02:08:14,061
I won't be fighting for him.

951
02:08:14,094 --> 02:08:15,396
I'm fighting for my people.

952
02:08:19,266 --> 02:08:21,101
I came to wish you best of luck.

953
02:08:22,369 --> 02:08:23,938
I'd wish you the same,

954
02:08:25,906 --> 02:08:27,474
but it seems
you've won your battle.

955
02:08:50,798 --> 02:08:52,099
He took the bait.

956
02:08:58,839 --> 02:09:00,774
Oh, the Emperor's very obliging.

957
02:09:01,809 --> 02:09:03,377
He's right on time.

958
02:09:36,477 --> 02:09:38,846
What is he doing here?

959
02:09:38,879 --> 02:09:40,981
I brought spice production
under control.

960
02:09:44,151 --> 02:09:45,319
What do we do?

961
02:09:46,887 --> 02:09:49,591
Send messages
to the Great Houses.

962
02:09:49,624 --> 02:09:53,861
Tell them that Arrakis
is under Sardaukar attack.

963
02:09:53,894 --> 02:09:56,564
Tell them, their future
hangs in the balance.

964
02:10:23,924 --> 02:10:26,427
When the storm hits this ridge,

965
02:10:26,460 --> 02:10:28,929
Gurney will open
the way for you, Stilgar,

966
02:10:28,962 --> 02:10:31,231
so you can enter
the basin from the West

967
02:10:31,265 --> 02:10:33,601
and distract
their defense systems.

968
02:10:33,635 --> 02:10:35,436
Chani, I want you
and your Fedaykin

969
02:10:35,469 --> 02:10:36,970
to then attack from the East,

970
02:10:37,938 --> 02:10:39,973
inside the basin.

971
02:10:40,007 --> 02:10:42,109
I'll strike from the
North, head on,

972
02:10:42,142 --> 02:10:44,211
with the Fundamentalist troops.

973
02:10:44,244 --> 02:10:47,081
And I'll serve Arrakeen
for dessert.

974
02:10:47,114 --> 02:10:49,283
Remember,
I need the Emperor alive.

975
02:11:49,544 --> 02:11:50,545
Hm.

976
02:11:58,686 --> 02:12:01,188
Baron,

977
02:12:01,221 --> 02:12:06,059
do you have any idea
who this <i>Muad'Dib</i> could be?

978
02:12:06,093 --> 02:12:09,062
Some fanatic, your Majesty.
That's all we know.

979
02:12:09,096 --> 02:12:11,098
More. More. Give me more.

980
02:12:11,131 --> 02:12:12,232
He's a madman!

981
02:12:12,266 --> 02:12:14,268
- Mad?
- All Fremen are mad.

982
02:12:16,638 --> 02:12:18,673
That's all you know?

983
02:12:18,706 --> 02:12:20,675
Really?

984
02:12:20,708 --> 02:12:22,443
<i>Muad'Dib</i> is dead.

985
02:12:24,746 --> 02:12:27,749
Or he went hiding
in the Southern storms

986
02:12:27,782 --> 02:12:29,450
which means the same thing.

987
02:12:30,451 --> 02:12:31,753
Your Majesty,

988
02:12:31,786 --> 02:12:33,320
the sand storm
that's approaching

989
02:12:33,353 --> 02:12:35,757
threatens the integrity
of our shields.

990
02:12:35,790 --> 02:12:37,991
We recommend
going back into orbit.

991
02:12:38,025 --> 02:12:40,065
Well, the mountains will
protect us from most of it,

992
02:12:41,028 --> 02:12:42,229
your Majesty.

993
02:12:44,031 --> 02:12:48,168
Baron, have you
ever investigated

994
02:12:48,202 --> 02:12:51,539
the south regions of Arrakis?

995
02:12:51,573 --> 02:12:54,274
Well, the entire region
is uninhabitable.

996
02:12:54,308 --> 02:12:57,010
It's well known, your Majesty.

997
02:12:57,044 --> 02:13:01,148
Your uninhabited South

998
02:13:01,181 --> 02:13:04,251
exhibits evidence
of human activity.

999
02:13:04,284 --> 02:13:06,588
I wasn't aware of this.

1000
02:13:06,621 --> 02:13:09,156
I swear to you, I wasn't
aware of any of this.

1001
02:13:14,161 --> 02:13:15,597
<i>Muad'Dib</i> is alive.

1002
02:13:17,064 --> 02:13:18,265
I must find him.

1003
02:14:38,713 --> 02:14:40,213
Fire!

1004
02:15:19,887 --> 02:15:22,356
Sardaukar! On guard!

1005
02:19:36,110 --> 02:19:37,111
Sardaukar!

1006
02:20:42,610 --> 02:20:43,978
Grandfather.

1007
02:21:06,100 --> 02:21:07,702
You die like an animal.

1008
02:21:38,933 --> 02:21:39,967
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

1009
02:23:09,657 --> 02:23:10,758
Rabban!

1010
02:23:21,869 --> 02:23:23,637
Look who's back from the dead.

1011
02:23:37,985 --> 02:23:41,322
For my Duke, and my friends.

1012
02:24:46,954 --> 02:24:47,988
Warships.

1013
02:24:50,324 --> 02:24:51,425
The Great Houses.

1014
02:24:52,993 --> 02:24:55,462
Gurney, it's time.
Bring the prisoners.

1015
02:24:55,496 --> 02:24:59,099
My Lord.

1016
02:25:22,957 --> 02:25:24,124
This isn't over yet.

1017
02:25:30,130 --> 02:25:31,365
I want you to know...

1018
02:25:34,301 --> 02:25:36,303
I will love you
as long as I breathe.

1019
02:25:48,516 --> 02:25:50,985
There is a massed armada
in orbit.

1020
02:25:54,388 --> 02:25:58,158
You're facing
a full invasion, Fremen.

1021
02:25:58,192 --> 02:26:01,295
How can you be so sure the
Great Houses are here for me?

1022
02:26:07,268 --> 02:26:11,573
They may be curious to hear my
side of the story, don't you think?

1023
02:26:11,606 --> 02:26:16,176
I am Paul Atreides, son of
Leto Atreides, Duke of Arrakis.

1024
02:26:18,012 --> 02:26:19,480
- Gurney.
- My Lord.

1025
02:26:19,514 --> 02:26:21,882
Send a warning to all ships.

1026
02:26:21,915 --> 02:26:25,853
If the Great Houses attack, our
atomics will obliterate all spice fields.

1027
02:26:27,354 --> 02:26:30,057
- You're out of your mind.
- He's bluffing.

1028
02:26:30,090 --> 02:26:32,159
Consider what you're
about to do, Paul Atreides.

1029
02:26:32,192 --> 02:26:34,395
Silence!

1030
02:26:36,564 --> 02:26:38,065
Abomination.

1031
02:26:42,303 --> 02:26:43,871
Message sent, my Lord.

1032
02:26:45,906 --> 02:26:49,476
As a servant of the Imperium,
you will bow at my feet.

1033
02:26:49,511 --> 02:26:53,113
Your feet? You'll be lucky
to keep your head.

1034
02:26:56,350 --> 02:26:57,985
I'll take the hand
of your daughter.

1035
02:27:00,487 --> 02:27:02,489
She will remain safe.

1036
02:27:02,524 --> 02:27:05,159
And we will rule together
over the Empire.

1037
02:27:14,935 --> 02:27:16,170
But you...

1038
02:27:19,039 --> 02:27:20,608
You have to answer
for my father.

1039
02:27:28,248 --> 02:27:31,985
Do you know why I killed him?

1040
02:27:33,253 --> 02:27:35,222
Because he was a man

1041
02:27:35,255 --> 02:27:37,224
who believed
in the rules of the heart.

1042
02:27:38,593 --> 02:27:40,494
But the heart
is not meant to rule.

1043
02:27:42,096 --> 02:27:43,130
In other words...

1044
02:27:45,533 --> 02:27:49,203
your father was a weak man.

1045
02:27:58,278 --> 02:28:01,315
Stand or choose your champion.

1046
02:28:04,151 --> 02:28:05,587
I am here, Atreides.

1047
02:28:08,155 --> 02:28:09,390
I need a blade.

1048
02:28:09,423 --> 02:28:11,058
Accept mine.

1049
02:28:23,070 --> 02:28:26,073
Do not stain your hands
on this animal.

1050
02:28:26,106 --> 02:28:27,441
Let me deal with him.

1051
02:28:27,474 --> 02:28:29,209
It's my burden, Gurney.

1052
02:28:47,729 --> 02:28:50,230
Why does he take such risks?

1053
02:28:50,264 --> 02:28:52,567
<i>Muad'Dib</i> leads the way.

1054
02:29:16,423 --> 02:29:19,727
I'm happy
to finally meet you, cousin.

1055
02:29:21,161 --> 02:29:23,997
Cousin? Is that right?

1056
02:29:26,266 --> 02:29:31,171
Well, you wouldn't be
the first relative I've killed.

1057
02:29:33,775 --> 02:29:36,611
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1058
02:29:40,047 --> 02:29:44,184
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1059
02:30:35,202 --> 02:30:38,038
She's your pet?

1060
02:30:52,820 --> 02:30:56,189
Any special attention
for the pet?

1061
02:32:22,910 --> 02:32:24,812
You have fought well, Atreides.

1062
02:32:32,553 --> 02:32:34,221
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

1063
02:32:34,254 --> 02:32:36,490
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

1064
02:33:29,010 --> 02:33:31,713
<i>You should've believed.</i>

1065
02:33:31,746 --> 02:33:33,380
<i>You chose the wrong side.</i>

1066
02:33:34,682 --> 02:33:36,349
<i>Side?</i>

1067
02:33:36,383 --> 02:33:39,453
<i>You, of all people, should know.</i>

1068
02:33:39,486 --> 02:33:43,858
<i>There are no sides...
Reverend Mother.</i>

1069
02:34:03,044 --> 02:34:04,946
The life debt has been paid.

1070
02:34:04,979 --> 02:34:06,824
Spare my father now and
I will be your willing bride.

1071
02:34:06,848 --> 02:34:08,381
The throne will be yours.

1072
02:35:40,942 --> 02:35:44,512
My Lord,
the Great Houses have answered.

1073
02:35:44,545 --> 02:35:46,446
They refuse
to honor your ascendancy.

1074
02:35:47,949 --> 02:35:51,085
We await your orders,
<i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>

1075
02:36:00,161 --> 02:36:01,996
Lead them to Paradise.

1076
02:36:02,029 --> 02:36:03,698
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

1077
02:36:03,731 --> 02:36:05,967
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

1078
02:36:20,948 --> 02:36:24,619
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

1079
02:36:33,160 --> 02:36:34,962
<i>What is happening, Mother?</i>

1080
02:36:37,031 --> 02:36:39,533
Your brother attacks
the Great Houses.

1081
02:36:43,070 --> 02:36:45,505
The Holy War begins.
