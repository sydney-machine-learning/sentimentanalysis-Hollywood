1
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,008
That's them in there
just like that?

2
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,445
Just like that.

3
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,796
I wouldn't go in there
for a day or two.

4
00:03:34,927 --> 00:03:36,647
Heard the expression
kick the hornet's nest?

5
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:38,474
I'll stay right
here. Thank you.

6
00:03:39,062 --> 00:03:40,715
Those things scare me to death.

7
00:03:40,716 --> 00:03:42,310
They been killing my honey bees.

8
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,801
A few days unchecked,

9
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:46,261
they'll wipe out
the whole colony.

10
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:47,722
What are you gonna do with them?

11
00:03:47,723 --> 00:03:49,158
Well, that's
between me and them,

12
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,204
if you don't mind.

13
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:52,423
That's okay.

14
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,686
I understand these things.

15
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,908
I just wanted to thank you

16
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:01,867
for putting up with me,

17
00:04:03,771 --> 00:04:05,164
and all of my bees.

18
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:07,829
This place was
crabgrass and weeds,

19
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,110
and you brought it back to life.

20
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:11,536
You're a blessing.

21
00:04:13,009 --> 00:04:15,067
No one's ever taken
care of me before.

22
00:04:20,756 --> 00:04:21,800
I'll, uh...

23
00:04:24,107 --> 00:04:25,282
Mr. Clay...

24
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,766
Come back at suppertime.
Let me feed you.

25
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,263
Boss.

26
00:05:40,288 --> 00:05:42,122
- You got something, yeah?
- I got one.

27
00:05:42,333 --> 00:05:43,838
I want it. I need it.

28
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,318
Hey, put it in my ear.

29
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,147
Get this fucking hippie
shit down, please.

30
00:05:49,845 --> 00:05:52,020
United Data Group. Good
afternoon. This is Boyd.

31
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:53,065
How may I help you?

32
00:05:53,544 --> 00:05:54,936
Boyd.

33
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,156
Uh, hello. I just
got a message saying

34
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:59,158
that there's a problem
with my computer.

35
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,942
<i>Don't you worry. The
message you received</i>

36
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,162
<i>is from our United Data
Group antivirus software.</i>

37
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,528
<i>It's part of the
software package</i>

38
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,140
<i>that you pre-installed
on your computer.</i>

39
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,515
I'm sorry. I'm not
a computer person.

40
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:10,518
What did you say the name
of your product is again?

41
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:19,961
Now, our records show
that you actually

42
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,832
have an older version
on your account.

43
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:24,444
So what I'm going to need
you to do is uninstall that

44
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:26,228
<i>and install the latest version.</i>

45
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:28,143
Well, I have no
idea how to do that.

46
00:06:28,144 --> 00:06:29,710
My daughter set up
everything for me.

47
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:31,180
<i>Well, I would recommend</i>

48
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:32,645
<i>you take your computer
to an IT specialist.</i>

49
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,236
However, keep in mind

50
00:06:34,237 --> 00:06:36,238
that you will lose
all your data,

51
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:38,653
since they'll have to
replace the hard drive.

52
00:06:39,938 --> 00:06:41,591
I'm pretty remote out here.

53
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:45,291
Everything I have
is on the computer.

54
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:46,685
<i>Okay. There is actually</i>

55
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,642
<i>a software package
that you can download</i>

56
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:50,948
that would allow me
to reinstall remotely.

57
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:54,406
All right. Tell me what to do.

58
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:56,838
It's okay. Can you,
uh, can you type this,

59
00:06:56,863 --> 00:06:59,908
Friendly friend dot net?

60
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:02,021
<i>Spelled just how it sounds.</i>

61
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,832
Okay. I'm there.

62
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,268
And there should be a button

63
00:07:06,269 --> 00:07:07,356
on your screen that
says "install."

64
00:07:07,357 --> 00:07:08,705
<i>Can you click on that button?</i>

65
00:07:08,706 --> 00:07:09,911
I clicked the button.

66
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:11,685
So you're about to
see some windows

67
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,319
open, close on your desktop,

68
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,408
<i>as I reinstall the
virus shield for you.</i>

69
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,310
Okay.

70
00:07:18,335 --> 00:07:20,543
I hope you fucking clowns
are paying attention.

71
00:07:20,568 --> 00:07:22,217
You stick to the script,

72
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:26,419
but not so much that you
sound like a goddamn robot.

73
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,637
All right?

74
00:07:27,638 --> 00:07:30,336
She has got 10K checking,

75
00:07:30,337 --> 00:07:33,252
life insurance
annuity, Roth IRA,

76
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,514
teacher's pension and...

77
00:07:34,515 --> 00:07:37,125
Holy fucking shit!

78
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:38,953
All right.

79
00:07:38,954 --> 00:07:41,085
She is a signatory

80
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:44,132
on a $2 million dollar account.

81
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:47,266
Some, uh... It's
some fucking charity.

82
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:50,660
All right, kids, let
the strip mining begin.

83
00:07:52,881 --> 00:07:54,447
Ooh. My computer's
going crazy.

84
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:55,216
<i>Totally normal.</i>

85
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,599
<i>Just do not touch your keyboard.</i>

86
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:06,328
Because of this inconvenience,

87
00:08:06,329 --> 00:08:07,808
I'm going to credit back
your subscription fees.

88
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:08,983
How about that?

89
00:08:08,984 --> 00:08:10,989
I've gone ahead
and deposited $500

90
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:13,517
into the account ending 020.

91
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:15,282
Oh, that's not my account.

92
00:08:15,307 --> 00:08:17,047
That's an account that I manage.

93
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,558
Can you log into that account

94
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:20,342
and verify the transfer,
please, Miss Parker?

95
00:08:21,866 --> 00:08:24,259
Just hold on.

96
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:26,088
Yes, there's...

97
00:08:27,698 --> 00:08:30,352
There's a transfer for $50,000?

98
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,833
Set the hook with sympathy.

99
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:36,968
Miss Parker, I...

100
00:08:37,871 --> 00:08:39,122
I made a terrible mistake.

101
00:08:39,147 --> 00:08:40,669
<i>I was supposed to
credit you 500,</i>

102
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,713
<i>but I don't know, I
got a stuck key here.</i>

103
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:45,294
<i>I'm gonna lose my job here.</i>

104
00:08:46,021 --> 00:08:47,364
I got kids.

105
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:49,216
I ain't got fucking kids.

106
00:08:50,678 --> 00:08:53,380
Oh, I don't want you to
get in trouble, but...

107
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:57,423
I could wire the amount back.

108
00:08:57,424 --> 00:09:00,997
I will need a different
password though.

109
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:02,457
One second.

110
00:09:02,857 --> 00:09:06,078
This is the master password
for all her accounts.

111
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:10,958
Okay, so the second we get
it, we zero out everything.

112
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,961
Um...

113
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:17,400
You know, I, um...

114
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:21,448
I think I should
call the bank. Hm?

115
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:23,187
<i>You know what? You're
probably right.</i>

116
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,800
But there goes my job,

117
00:09:26,322 --> 00:09:29,107
and there goes all your data.

118
00:09:34,722 --> 00:09:39,770
All my kids' pictures
are on this computer.

119
00:09:43,242 --> 00:09:44,461
Okay.

120
00:09:49,147 --> 00:09:51,014
Boom! Fucking yes!

121
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,693
That is what I am
talking about! Come on!

122
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:57,874
Let me fucking hear it! I
fucking love you people!

123
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:59,223
I fucking love you!

124
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:04,901
Hello?

125
00:10:05,144 --> 00:10:06,711
Hello? You still there?

126
00:10:15,257 --> 00:10:16,606
Uh-oh.

127
00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:20,537
Oh.

128
00:10:27,873 --> 00:10:29,048
Oh.

129
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,905
What did I do?

130
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:51,373
Stupid...

131
00:11:33,243 --> 00:11:34,528
Mrs. Parker?

132
00:11:59,472 --> 00:12:00,734
Don't move.

133
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:03,523
Don't you fucking move.

134
00:12:04,393 --> 00:12:05,437
Drop the knife.

135
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:10,774
Hands behind your back.

136
00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:17,449
Slowly get on your knees
one knee at a time.

137
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,588
Now, who the fuck are you...

138
00:12:26,589 --> 00:12:28,721
and what are you doing
in my mother's house?

139
00:12:31,986 --> 00:12:33,030
Verona...

140
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:36,133
I'm so sorry.

141
00:12:36,686 --> 00:12:38,000
How do you know my...

142
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,519
Mom.

143
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,482
<i>Until we can clear him,
he's our best and only perp.</i>

144
00:12:51,483 --> 00:12:52,919
Clear him?

145
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,311
Agent Parker, I know
that's your mother.

146
00:12:54,312 --> 00:12:55,563
I understand.

147
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:58,985
But there's a world where
she committed suicide.

148
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,888
Suicide? You can't be serious.

149
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:09,544
That woman loved life
more than anybody I know.

150
00:13:09,545 --> 00:13:11,764
But by all means, let's
just completely ignore

151
00:13:11,765 --> 00:13:13,809
the big white dude in
her house with a knife.

152
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,219
Get him up.

153
00:13:15,638 --> 00:13:16,638
Come on.

154
00:13:20,948 --> 00:13:22,210
It's Clay, right?

155
00:13:22,906 --> 00:13:23,906
Adam Clay?

156
00:13:24,576 --> 00:13:25,875
I don't have much to say.

157
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,985
Mr. Clay, we just got
a couple of questions.

158
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,390
Like, what the
fuck were you doing

159
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:30,653
in my mother's house?

160
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,500
I was bringing her
a jar of honey.

161
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:36,050
A jar of honey.

162
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:38,661
Who the fuck are
you? Winnie-the-Pooh?

163
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:40,407
I keep bees.

164
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:43,492
How do you know my mother?

165
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,277
I rent some space in
the barn from her.

166
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:48,453
I have a signed lease.

167
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:52,544
But what the fuck were
you doing in her house?

168
00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:56,504
She didn't answer
when I knocked.

169
00:13:56,505 --> 00:13:57,930
I noted her car in the driveway.

170
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:00,161
I heard the smoke
alarm and I entered.

171
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:02,087
You "noted"?

172
00:14:02,563 --> 00:14:04,125
You got a law
enforcement background?

173
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,665
I told you, I take care of bees.

174
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:53,344
Oh, my God.

175
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:19,022
His hands tested negative
for gunshot residue.

176
00:15:19,675 --> 00:15:21,503
But the prints on the
gun were your mother's.

177
00:15:22,508 --> 00:15:24,724
It seems, sadly, it was suicide.

178
00:15:35,343 --> 00:15:38,520
Mr. Clay, I need to
apologize for last night.

179
00:15:39,826 --> 00:15:42,089
I realize I may have
been a little aggressive.

180
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,235
That's understandable.

181
00:15:51,011 --> 00:15:53,243
Could I interest you in
something a bit stronger?

182
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,625
No.

183
00:15:58,105 --> 00:15:59,790
But I'll sit with
you if you like.

184
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:07,809
No, thank you.

185
00:16:12,336 --> 00:16:13,337
I wanted to thank you

186
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:16,407
for taking care of my mom.

187
00:16:18,101 --> 00:16:20,834
I tried to stay in her
life as much as I could.

188
00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:22,499
Obviously, I could
have done a better job.

189
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,177
Being old can be a lonely thing.

190
00:16:29,136 --> 00:16:32,792
Turn a certain age, you cease
to exist. Cease to matter.

191
00:16:33,444 --> 00:16:36,230
Used to be a part of
life, of the family.

192
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:39,209
Part of the hive, I
guess you could say.

193
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:43,805
There's some British Isles
hiding in your accent.

194
00:16:46,453 --> 00:16:47,628
I was born there.

195
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,550
I hated that she
was out here alone.

196
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,687
She wouldn't leave.

197
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:00,086
There's too many memories.

198
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:05,711
You know, I think I
know why she liked you.

199
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:07,953
You're just like my brother.

200
00:17:09,393 --> 00:17:11,508
He was in MARSOC,
a Marine Raider.

201
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:14,743
He was killed a few
years ago kicking doors.

202
00:17:16,012 --> 00:17:18,930
She loved him.

203
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,906
He'd mow the lawn

204
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:22,579
and you'd think
he invented fire.

205
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,366
You know, while I
graduated the FBI Academy

206
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:28,543
and she said,
"Oh, that's nice."

207
00:17:31,676 --> 00:17:32,922
She got scammed.

208
00:17:34,882 --> 00:17:36,971
Somebody emptied out
all her accounts,

209
00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:39,553
her savings, her retirement.

210
00:17:39,554 --> 00:17:42,556
Got every penny. Maxed
out all her cards.

211
00:17:42,557 --> 00:17:44,471
She was an educator,

212
00:17:44,472 --> 00:17:46,672
director of a charity for kids.

213
00:17:47,352 --> 00:17:49,297
They got two million
out of that account.

214
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:53,388
You know who did it?

215
00:17:53,413 --> 00:17:55,438
I talked to an agent in
our cyber-crimes office.

216
00:17:55,844 --> 00:17:57,367
This crew's been
operating for two years

217
00:17:57,391 --> 00:17:59,086
and we don't even have names.

218
00:17:59,424 --> 00:18:01,165
And even if we did, good
luck building an indictment

219
00:18:01,189 --> 00:18:02,563
that would stand up in court.

220
00:18:03,008 --> 00:18:04,969
Some defense attorney
would just argue that

221
00:18:05,478 --> 00:18:07,477
the elderly victim agreed

222
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:09,542
to wire a complete stranger
his entire life savings.

223
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:11,902
Taking from an elderly person

224
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:13,633
is as bad as stealing
from a child.

225
00:18:15,412 --> 00:18:16,717
Maybe worse.

226
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,718
Someone hurts a child,

227
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,117
there are parents.

228
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,850
People who care,
ready to step in.

229
00:18:25,426 --> 00:18:27,123
Someone hurts an older person...

230
00:18:29,256 --> 00:18:31,823
sometimes they're left to
face the hornets alone.

231
00:18:34,391 --> 00:18:36,016
Because either it
goes unnoticed...

232
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:39,788
or no one cares.

233
00:18:41,341 --> 00:18:42,560
I care.

234
00:18:44,271 --> 00:18:45,533
And I'm stubborn.

235
00:18:46,618 --> 00:18:47,837
And so help me God,

236
00:18:47,862 --> 00:18:50,494
I'm going to get these
motherfuckers who did this.

237
00:18:56,457 --> 00:18:58,241
I need to take care of the hive.

238
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:02,601
You've been up all night.

239
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,161
The hive is more important.

240
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:23,196
What are you doing?

241
00:19:23,221 --> 00:19:25,180
- I thought you retired.
<i><i>- I did.</i>

242
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,705
I need a favor.

243
00:19:27,977 --> 00:19:29,403
<i>What kind of favor?</i>

244
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,995
A name and address.

245
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,899
<i>- Easy.</i>
- Not easy.

246
00:19:36,145 --> 00:19:38,495
Even the FBI can't
find these people.

247
00:19:39,263 --> 00:19:40,830
Well, we're not the FBI, are we?

248
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:42,596
<i>Shoot me the deets and stand by.</i>

249
00:19:49,075 --> 00:19:50,180
Yeah.

250
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:52,271
You weren't kidding.
This one kicked my butt.

251
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:53,861
They're routing
all over the world.

252
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:55,210
But you found them?

253
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:57,352
Sure. But who
are these people?

254
00:19:58,089 --> 00:19:59,569
I'm gonna find out.

255
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:06,364
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

256
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:08,043
The hell you think
you're going, pal?

257
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:10,114
This United Data Group?

258
00:20:10,139 --> 00:20:11,532
Don't know nothing about that.

259
00:20:11,851 --> 00:20:14,461
This is private property,
and you're trespassing.

260
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:16,083
I'm going inside.

261
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:18,444
I'm going to burn it down.

262
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,714
Yeah, that's not
happening, buddy.

263
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:22,237
You're not going
any-fucking-where

264
00:20:22,238 --> 00:20:24,196
except right the fuck
back the way you came.

265
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,266
Do you know what they do here?

266
00:20:27,156 --> 00:20:29,028
Buddy, I'm counting to three.

267
00:20:29,637 --> 00:20:31,378
One, two, three.

268
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:33,673
There. I did it for you.

269
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:38,266
You aware this is
a criminal outfit?

270
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:40,429
Scamming the weakest
in our society.

271
00:20:40,695 --> 00:20:42,641
Stealing everything they have.

272
00:20:43,188 --> 00:20:44,659
Do you know that's
who you work for?

273
00:20:57,735 --> 00:20:59,425
<i>I'm looking for the call center.</i>

274
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,015
Yeah, you're in the right place.

275
00:21:01,016 --> 00:21:02,757
You just have to sign in here.

276
00:21:07,586 --> 00:21:09,110
Tell any other companies
in the building

277
00:21:09,111 --> 00:21:10,111
to evacuate now.

278
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,723
- There's going to be a fire.
- Okay. Th...

279
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:14,724
Thanks.

280
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,563
Hang up the phone.

281
00:21:20,588 --> 00:21:22,959
Nah, I'm good, buddy. I'm
just doing my thing here.

282
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:26,383
Hang up the phone.

283
00:21:26,461 --> 00:21:30,446
Uh, Miss Perkins, so
sorry, I'll have to

284
00:21:30,473 --> 00:21:32,344
- call you right back.
- Everyone...

285
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,422
I need your attention, please.

286
00:21:36,138 --> 00:21:37,138
Repeat after me.

287
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:40,313
I will never steal from the weak

288
00:21:40,338 --> 00:21:41,915
and the vulnerable again.

289
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,922
I sent you a
department download,

290
00:21:45,947 --> 00:21:47,558
and we'll find out
what's going on...

291
00:22:01,468 --> 00:22:02,556
Repeat after me.

292
00:22:03,552 --> 00:22:05,510
I will never steal from the weak

293
00:22:05,535 --> 00:22:06,926
and the vulnerable again.

294
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,735
I will never steal from the weak

295
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:10,346
and the vulnerable again.

296
00:22:13,172 --> 00:22:14,829
To help you keep that promise,

297
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:17,701
I'm gonna burn this
place to the ground.

298
00:22:20,661 --> 00:22:22,445
Might be a good time to go home.

299
00:22:23,407 --> 00:22:24,838
Oh, my God!

300
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,580
It's gas! MAN 4:
Fucking psycho.

301
00:22:28,495 --> 00:22:29,670
It's gas!

302
00:22:30,754 --> 00:22:32,508
It's gas! It's gas!

303
00:22:36,696 --> 00:22:37,851
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

304
00:22:38,235 --> 00:22:40,071
What the fuck, bro?

305
00:22:41,079 --> 00:22:42,856
What the fuck do you
think you're doing?

306
00:22:42,857 --> 00:22:43,858
I'm a beekeeper.

307
00:22:44,773 --> 00:22:46,209
I protect the hive.

308
00:22:47,482 --> 00:22:49,788
Sometimes I use fire
to smoke out hornets.

309
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,302
This a multi-million
dollar operation, asshole.

310
00:22:53,327 --> 00:22:55,023
Okay, so you can't come up here,

311
00:22:55,048 --> 00:22:56,485
white-knighting shit.

312
00:23:00,527 --> 00:23:02,529
Will you stomp his
ass out, please?

313
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:20,352
I got it. You fucking get him.

314
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:21,571
You fucking get him!

315
00:23:32,207 --> 00:23:34,282
Bet you feel really
proud of yourself.

316
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,366
Mister...?

317
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:58,836
Uh...

318
00:23:58,861 --> 00:24:01,327
- Uh, uh, Garnett.
- Mr. Garnett.

319
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,765
I don't care if your
friends here live or die.

320
00:24:05,766 --> 00:24:08,811
The next call from your
little phishing scam

321
00:24:08,812 --> 00:24:10,291
to this call center

322
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:12,554
will make a spark
across these wires.

323
00:24:12,555 --> 00:24:14,949
Given all of the
gasoline fumes in here,

324
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,778
I promise you...

325
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,824
anything alive in here won't be.

326
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:29,397
Uh, guys, we might
want to dip out.

327
00:24:55,337 --> 00:24:57,207
Hey. What's going on?

328
00:24:57,208 --> 00:25:01,864
Uh, let me get flat white,
oat milk, of course,

329
00:25:01,865 --> 00:25:03,586
and, uh, extra shot of espresso.

330
00:25:03,611 --> 00:25:05,177
- Of course, sir.
- Thank you.

331
00:25:05,202 --> 00:25:09,075
Good morning. Did we get
the otoro and the uni in?

332
00:25:09,571 --> 00:25:11,134
- Yes, sure.
- We did?

333
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:12,876
- Yes.
- Fucking finally. Great.

334
00:25:15,486 --> 00:25:17,444
- Hey, Michaela.
- Yes.

335
00:25:17,469 --> 00:25:19,992
It... it came back.
The whole thing. Yeah.

336
00:25:20,017 --> 00:25:21,821
And it's like I can
barely fucking move.

337
00:25:21,846 --> 00:25:23,461
It's all tweaked.

338
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:27,399
- Oh, those are nice.
- Mmm-hmm.

339
00:25:27,424 --> 00:25:29,344
- Those the new bowls?
- Yeah.

340
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:33,026
- That's perfect. Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

341
00:25:38,425 --> 00:25:39,813
What? I'm in a meeting.

342
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:40,868
<i>You said hit me on voice</i>

343
00:25:40,893 --> 00:25:42,149
<i>if there's an emergency.</i>

344
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,813
Okay. Right. Well, uh...

345
00:25:45,641 --> 00:25:48,805
It seems we had a
disgruntled customer.

346
00:25:50,219 --> 00:25:52,797
Uh, I just can't comprehend
why you're bothering me.

347
00:25:52,822 --> 00:25:54,475
Just get in touch
with the attorney

348
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,665
and start shoving back.

349
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:59,461
Well, yeah, I don't think
that legal's gonna help much.

350
00:26:00,228 --> 00:26:02,055
Okay, tell me what the
fuck is going on right now.

351
00:26:02,056 --> 00:26:04,555
This dude just strolls in

352
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,485
saying we're
stealing from people,

353
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,329
<i>and he just tears through
all my security guys,</i>

354
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:12,850
<i>like, fucking tissue
paper and, um...</i>

355
00:26:12,875 --> 00:26:14,110
And what?

356
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:16,592
And he burns the
place to the ground.

357
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:19,446
<i>Yeah. The call center is gone.</i>

358
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:22,698
<i>I'm standing here staring
at a $30 million building,</i>

359
00:26:22,723 --> 00:26:25,769
it's now a giant
fucking ashtray.

360
00:26:27,013 --> 00:26:28,318
Four people didn't get out.

361
00:26:28,343 --> 00:26:29,722
You're telling me
that this asshole

362
00:26:29,747 --> 00:26:31,008
burnt the entire building down

363
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:32,868
and dropped four fucking bodies?

364
00:26:32,893 --> 00:26:34,939
Yeah, that's not exactly a
disgruntled customer, is it?

365
00:26:34,963 --> 00:26:36,519
<i>Who did this? Give
me a name right now.</i>

366
00:26:36,544 --> 00:26:38,372
Sir, I don't have it.

367
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:41,616
<i>All the cameras and the
drives burned up in the fire.</i>

368
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:43,444
He had a hat.

369
00:26:43,445 --> 00:26:45,533
Oh, he had a hat. Okay.

370
00:26:45,534 --> 00:26:46,637
I'm gonna hit you
back. All right?

371
00:26:46,661 --> 00:26:48,667
I got to go big-dog
this shit for a minute.

372
00:26:54,862 --> 00:26:56,893
- Hey, I need to talk to you.
- About what?

373
00:26:57,307 --> 00:26:58,607
What? What? No, nothing.

374
00:26:58,632 --> 00:27:01,401
I mean, if I had a friend
who, like, had a call center

375
00:27:01,426 --> 00:27:03,667
and someone burned it down,
maybe killed some people,

376
00:27:03,692 --> 00:27:05,682
you could get him, right?

377
00:27:06,102 --> 00:27:07,284
Get him?

378
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:08,817
Yeah, like disappear
the problem.

379
00:27:08,818 --> 00:27:10,487
Come on.

380
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:12,479
I'll be an hour.

381
00:27:12,504 --> 00:27:14,679
That's way above my pay grade.

382
00:27:14,887 --> 00:27:16,540
You literally ran the CIA,

383
00:27:16,565 --> 00:27:18,174
and you're telling me
you can't just find

384
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:19,557
some guy in Massachusetts?

385
00:27:19,582 --> 00:27:21,549
Listen, this sounds like
a job for the police.

386
00:27:22,092 --> 00:27:23,137
I just need a name.

387
00:27:23,477 --> 00:27:24,995
Well, you won't get it from me.

388
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,760
And you keep me a
million miles away

389
00:27:27,785 --> 00:27:29,151
from your metaverse meth lab

390
00:27:29,176 --> 00:27:30,401
or whatever it is.

391
00:27:31,885 --> 00:27:33,146
Yup.

392
00:27:33,147 --> 00:27:34,057
So check it out.

393
00:27:34,082 --> 00:27:36,323
Daddy can't hold your
hand on this one.

394
00:27:36,324 --> 00:27:38,984
Uh, this is clearly some
kind of crime of passion,

395
00:27:39,009 --> 00:27:40,163
spur of the moment,

396
00:27:40,188 --> 00:27:41,890
someone snapped, like, whatever.

397
00:27:41,915 --> 00:27:43,263
But, uh, what we're
going to do is

398
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:44,550
I'm going to send
you some credentials,

399
00:27:44,574 --> 00:27:46,053
you're going to
log into our cloud

400
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:47,336
and you're going to
look at anyone connected

401
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,899
to the last few deals
you closed. All right?

402
00:27:48,923 --> 00:27:50,445
<i>Just, I don't know, start there.</i>

403
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,881
And, like, what if
I find this guy?

404
00:27:52,906 --> 00:27:54,123
Then what?

405
00:27:54,124 --> 00:27:56,281
You get a wrecking crew together

406
00:27:56,306 --> 00:27:57,318
and you go <i>Goodfellas</i> on him.

407
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,985
I mean, come on, you're
a connected guy, right?

408
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:00,153
Do you understand?

409
00:28:02,156 --> 00:28:04,376
Yeah. No, I
understand. I, uh...

410
00:28:04,742 --> 00:28:06,006
I'll get it done.

411
00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:23,525
It's called a day off.

412
00:28:24,677 --> 00:28:25,678
<i>V, you good?</i>

413
00:28:26,156 --> 00:28:27,506
Yeah, I'm great. Why?

414
00:28:28,536 --> 00:28:30,357
I mean, you did lose
your mother yesterday.

415
00:28:33,449 --> 00:28:34,450
Yeah.

416
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:38,856
<i>What do you want, Wiley?</i>

417
00:28:38,881 --> 00:28:40,534
Are you leaving?
Please don't go.

418
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,561
I'm going to yoga.

419
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:45,215
Remember United Data Group?

420
00:28:48,725 --> 00:28:49,726
<i>Go on.</i>

421
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:51,882
You sober enough to drive?

422
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:56,925
Yeah.

423
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:02,142
Give us a few
seconds, thank you.

424
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,934
Where's mine?

425
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:07,239
It's an old cup from my car

426
00:29:07,264 --> 00:29:09,185
with instant and gas
station hot water.

427
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,122
Ew.

428
00:29:10,147 --> 00:29:11,373
- You want a sip?
- No.

429
00:29:12,227 --> 00:29:15,966
So the fire fried
all the CCTV footage.

430
00:29:16,885 --> 00:29:18,887
Receptionist said she saw
some jacked dude in his 40s,

431
00:29:18,911 --> 00:29:20,738
manhandled security
and walked in

432
00:29:20,763 --> 00:29:21,951
with a couple gas cans.

433
00:29:22,691 --> 00:29:25,259
This clown car saw everything,
but no one's talking.

434
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:28,060
They're all frequent
fliers with perjury,

435
00:29:28,085 --> 00:29:30,260
fraud and cyber BeEFs.

436
00:29:30,712 --> 00:29:33,846
Fucking scumbags. I
want IDs on all of them.

437
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:39,114
You know, this is just the tip
of, like, 20 spears, right?

438
00:29:40,183 --> 00:29:41,446
Can I just have this moment?

439
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:58,554
Eloise Parker.

440
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:01,153
Yeah, I took her for over
two million yesterday.

441
00:30:01,178 --> 00:30:03,536
She's, uh... she's Black,

442
00:30:03,561 --> 00:30:05,482
widow, just has a
daughter in Boston.

443
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:07,255
I don't think this
is it, but, you know.

444
00:30:10,368 --> 00:30:13,224
You said your boy has
an old-ass pickup truck.

445
00:30:14,454 --> 00:30:15,586
That's him.

446
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,348
What the hell are those?

447
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:31,107
Fucking beehives.

448
00:30:31,542 --> 00:30:33,200
Yeah, dickhead was
talking about them.

449
00:30:33,225 --> 00:30:35,938
I guess he's a, like, bee lover.

450
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,436
You know what?

451
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:41,463
He breaks my shit,
you break his shit.

452
00:31:29,403 --> 00:31:31,100
Where you at, bee boy?

453
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:35,231
You fucking hiding, bitch?

454
00:31:35,818 --> 00:31:37,951
Come out and fucking face us!

455
00:31:46,922 --> 00:31:48,315
Bye, bitch, now!

456
00:31:49,098 --> 00:31:50,360
Let's go!

457
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,908
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

458
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:02,606
Can someone, like,
fucking help me?

459
00:33:04,695 --> 00:33:06,138
Fuck.

460
00:33:07,046 --> 00:33:08,917
No! I'm okay.

461
00:33:12,161 --> 00:33:13,435
We can talk about this.

462
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,939
We can talk about this.

463
00:33:14,964 --> 00:33:16,964
Let's just work this out,
me and you. We can fix...

464
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,622
No, no!

465
00:33:21,336 --> 00:33:23,700
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

466
00:33:35,501 --> 00:33:38,895
So, help me understand
because I'm a little confused.

467
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,485
What's the nature
of your business?

468
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,489
Don't know nothing
about no business.

469
00:33:42,514 --> 00:33:44,256
So then why are
people just wiring you

470
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:45,735
their entire life savings?

471
00:33:45,736 --> 00:33:48,536
Must be your
winning personality.

472
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:49,565
They got us lawyers,

473
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,036
so maybe you want
to talk to them.

474
00:33:52,879 --> 00:33:54,750
You know, this is a really
nice shirt, by the way.

475
00:33:54,774 --> 00:33:56,724
Did you steal it out of
a casket, you dog fucker?

476
00:33:56,749 --> 00:33:58,489
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh...

477
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,140
Verona, if you're
done shitting all over

478
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,902
this gentleman's civil rights,

479
00:34:01,927 --> 00:34:03,537
can I speak to you for a moment?

480
00:34:04,854 --> 00:34:06,073
That's a nice shirt.

481
00:34:07,995 --> 00:34:10,746
- V.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

482
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:12,981
I'm an asshole.

483
00:34:14,124 --> 00:34:15,865
Oh, so you like fires?

484
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,739
Yeah, today I do.

485
00:34:18,141 --> 00:34:20,273
Good, 'cause, uh,
today's your lucky day.

486
00:34:21,665 --> 00:34:23,058
'Cause apparently,
your mother's house

487
00:34:23,082 --> 00:34:24,909
is on fire, too,
and some other shit.

488
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,515
- Let's go.
- Wait. What?

489
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:29,084
Yeah. Shit's on
fire. Let's go.

490
00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:46,802
You good?

491
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:48,756
V, you okay?

492
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:51,653
Yeah.

493
00:34:52,956 --> 00:34:55,479
- That's a new one.
- Jesus Christ.

494
00:34:55,504 --> 00:34:57,864
Where's Maggie?
Hey, Maggie, ID?

495
00:35:01,873 --> 00:35:04,267
- United Data Group.
- Well, he's handsome.

496
00:35:05,468 --> 00:35:06,600
Thank you.

497
00:35:08,836 --> 00:35:09,923
Are you okay?

498
00:35:09,948 --> 00:35:12,146
Yeah, Wiley, I'm
good. I'm good.

499
00:35:13,132 --> 00:35:14,959
You think there's even
the remotest chance

500
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,724
that the dude who burned
down United Data Group

501
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:18,990
is the same guy
renting this spot

502
00:35:19,014 --> 00:35:20,341
from your mother?

503
00:35:23,778 --> 00:35:25,028
The beekeeper.

504
00:35:28,697 --> 00:35:30,612
I lost my virginity
in that barn.

505
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,418
Fucking shit.

506
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:57,556
The universe is going
to have to wait.

507
00:35:57,581 --> 00:35:59,044
I gotta take this.

508
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,328
Yo, what's up, playa?

509
00:36:04,353 --> 00:36:05,543
This is the part
where you tell me

510
00:36:05,567 --> 00:36:06,737
what a good job you did,

511
00:36:06,762 --> 00:36:09,372
and I put you on a G6 to
Hawaii to chill for a week.

512
00:36:09,397 --> 00:36:11,230
I'm so sorry, Mr. Danforth.

513
00:36:12,385 --> 00:36:13,588
Did you fuck this up?

514
00:36:13,613 --> 00:36:15,296
Are you fucking
crying right now?

515
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,845
I'm not crying. I'm bleeding.

516
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:20,803
Bleeding? Why
are you bleeding?

517
00:36:20,804 --> 00:36:22,153
What do you mean, bleeding?

518
00:36:22,154 --> 00:36:25,809
My fingers on my right hand.

519
00:36:26,332 --> 00:36:27,462
He cut them off.

520
00:36:27,463 --> 00:36:30,510
Okay. Fuck off. Go. Go.

521
00:36:32,729 --> 00:36:35,818
He? Who the fuck is he?
Tell me who he is right now.

522
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:40,040
I don't know. A
fucking beekeeper.

523
00:36:40,041 --> 00:36:43,130
<i>Makes honey and
fucks with beehives.</i>

524
00:36:43,131 --> 00:36:45,829
He fucks with beehives?
What's he saying about bees?

525
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,800
I don't know. He
said he was, like,

526
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:49,698
protecting the
hive or something.

527
00:36:49,723 --> 00:36:51,593
Oh, fuck, man. What the...

528
00:36:51,618 --> 00:36:53,308
Oh, Jesus Christ!

529
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:54,949
No, no, no! Bro, bro, bro!

530
00:36:54,974 --> 00:36:56,496
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

531
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:58,696
You want money? You
want crypto? NFTs?

532
00:36:58,721 --> 00:37:00,244
I got fucking NFTs.

533
00:37:00,279 --> 00:37:01,972
What are you fucking... What?

534
00:37:01,997 --> 00:37:04,173
No! Dude, what the
fuck is this, man?

535
00:37:07,404 --> 00:37:08,579
Don't move.

536
00:37:10,213 --> 00:37:11,823
I fucking can't move!

537
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:14,988
<i>You're fucking crazy, man.</i>

538
00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:16,817
What the fuck, bro?

539
00:37:31,527 --> 00:37:33,789
What the fuck! No, no,
no, no! No, no, no!

540
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:37,098
Fucking stop the
fucking car! No! No!

541
00:37:53,462 --> 00:37:55,682
Who do I have the
pleasure of speaking with?

542
00:37:58,366 --> 00:38:00,778
Fuck you. That's who.

543
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,220
You burned down
my million-dollar

544
00:38:02,245 --> 00:38:03,245
fucking call center.

545
00:38:04,169 --> 00:38:05,779
Now I'm going to burn you down.

546
00:38:07,172 --> 00:38:08,563
You haven't told me your name.

547
00:38:08,564 --> 00:38:10,217
I told you my name.

548
00:38:10,218 --> 00:38:11,355
It's fuck you. Mr. Fuck You.

549
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,674
You better fucking remember it.

550
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:14,004
<i>Because you don't burn me down.</i>

551
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:15,764
<i>I burn you down.
You understand me?</i>

552
00:38:15,789 --> 00:38:18,226
You are fucking with forces
that you cannot comprehend.

553
00:38:18,835 --> 00:38:20,315
You sound young.

554
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,698
I bet you don't have
estate planning.

555
00:38:23,338 --> 00:38:25,731
I'm fucking 28 years old.
Why would I need that?

556
00:38:26,746 --> 00:38:28,193
I'm about to show you.

557
00:38:46,464 --> 00:38:48,058
<i>Breaking news in Springfield,</i>

558
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:49,736
<i>where three bodies
have been discovered</i>

559
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:52,110
<i>following an arson
fire at a small farm.</i>

560
00:38:52,135 --> 00:38:54,005
<i>There was an office
building explosion...</i>

561
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:57,308
- And you say one guy did this?
- Yup.

562
00:38:58,674 --> 00:39:01,761
Killed seven armed men
without firing a shot.

563
00:39:01,931 --> 00:39:04,941
Yup. And he said he
was going to kill me.

564
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,202
And this is your

565
00:39:08,407 --> 00:39:11,888
data mining consumer
service business, right?

566
00:39:12,776 --> 00:39:14,456
Yes, something like that.

567
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,790
Pulling in 9 million
a month in one office.

568
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:18,213
I've got, like, 20.

569
00:39:19,505 --> 00:39:20,549
Yeah.

570
00:39:22,642 --> 00:39:24,644
And the only thing
you know about him

571
00:39:25,425 --> 00:39:26,991
is he says he's a beekeeper.

572
00:39:27,888 --> 00:39:29,977
Yeah, it's like his
whole brand or whatever.

573
00:39:32,629 --> 00:39:35,327
Jesus.

574
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:37,391
What?

575
00:39:39,743 --> 00:39:45,743
For someone who has elevated
fucking up into an art form,

576
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,499
this might well
be your <i>Mona Lisa.</i>

577
00:39:50,581 --> 00:39:52,320
How did I fuck up?

578
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:55,802
I don't know. You've
done something.

579
00:39:56,753 --> 00:39:58,499
You've disturbed a Beekeeper.

580
00:39:58,893 --> 00:40:00,022
Oh.

581
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,981
Oh, okay. So fucking what?

582
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,852
Why'd I care if
the guy keeps bees?

583
00:40:03,853 --> 00:40:06,115
If a Beekeeper says
you're gonna die,

584
00:40:06,116 --> 00:40:07,292
you're gonna die.

585
00:40:07,854 --> 00:40:10,774
There's nothing I can do
or anybody else to stop it.

586
00:40:12,253 --> 00:40:15,924
So, like, what do you
even do here, then?

587
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:17,650
What good are you?

588
00:40:18,128 --> 00:40:19,391
Yeah.

589
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:26,093
I did 35 years of loyal
government service,

590
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:29,543
culminating as
director of the world's

591
00:40:29,568 --> 00:40:31,532
premier intelligence agency.

592
00:40:31,533 --> 00:40:32,838
I could have done anything,

593
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:35,932
but I chose this job as
a favor to your mother.

594
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,617
I keep Danforth
Enterprises safe.

595
00:40:40,284 --> 00:40:44,328
Keep her reputation
safe, her name safe.

596
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:46,417
It's my fucking
name too, all right?

597
00:40:46,418 --> 00:40:48,245
Oh, sit down.

598
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:49,985
I put up with you.

599
00:40:49,986 --> 00:40:51,596
I've put up with your tantrums,

600
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:55,018
kept you out of the tabloids,
kept you out of jail.

601
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:59,300
The endless stream
of sex workers.

602
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,638
You're a drowning
man. Do you know that?

603
00:41:05,686 --> 00:41:06,817
Mm.

604
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:07,799
You're scared.

605
00:41:07,831 --> 00:41:09,354
Dead right I'm scared.

606
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:13,272
Terrified. So should you be.

607
00:41:14,184 --> 00:41:17,479
Wallace, just tell me
what the fuck this guy is.

608
00:41:21,465 --> 00:41:24,554
He's probably the
last pair of eyes

609
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:26,159
that you're going to sneer at.

610
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,549
Okay, listen.

611
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,096
Remember our favorite
burning building?

612
00:41:35,121 --> 00:41:36,229
United Data Group.

613
00:41:36,254 --> 00:41:38,221
The guys who work
there are hackers,

614
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,508
con men, fraudsters,
et cetera, et cetera.

615
00:41:40,533 --> 00:41:43,086
Guy who ran it. Garnett.

616
00:41:43,111 --> 00:41:45,765
He's in the book. He's
a known mob associate.

617
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,878
He's missing, but I've
got PD chasing him down.

618
00:41:47,903 --> 00:41:50,514
Okay, so I had some
analysts run some shit,

619
00:41:50,539 --> 00:41:52,740
and I think I'm starting to
get the shape of the animal.

620
00:41:52,995 --> 00:41:55,345
Dude, I think United Data Group

621
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,066
is one of several call centers.

622
00:41:57,091 --> 00:41:58,961
So there's got to be
like a central office

623
00:41:58,986 --> 00:42:00,248
that's controlling all of them,

624
00:42:00,273 --> 00:42:01,768
and that's what we got to find.

625
00:42:01,793 --> 00:42:03,221
Wiley, this could be like

626
00:42:03,246 --> 00:42:05,205
a billion-dollar-a-year
operation.

627
00:42:05,872 --> 00:42:07,220
- Hello?
- Hey!

628
00:42:07,245 --> 00:42:09,072
Did you hear a single
word I just said?

629
00:42:09,097 --> 00:42:10,098
Yeah.

630
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:13,846
And?

631
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:15,565
I was just thinking
you come in here,

632
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,938
hungover on your day off,

633
00:42:16,963 --> 00:42:18,442
and gain more
yardage on this thing

634
00:42:18,467 --> 00:42:20,121
than the whole squad
has in two years.

635
00:42:20,995 --> 00:42:24,003
Yeah, well, they
fucked with my family.

636
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:27,000
What'd you get on Clay?

637
00:42:27,025 --> 00:42:28,495
- Your beekeeper?
- Yeah.

638
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,695
He's a ghost.

639
00:42:30,697 --> 00:42:31,877
What?

640
00:42:31,902 --> 00:42:33,642
Yeah, all I have is
a birth certificate

641
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:34,830
and a social.

642
00:42:35,338 --> 00:42:36,962
The guy's never even -

643
00:42:36,963 --> 00:42:38,050
had a bank account,

644
00:42:38,051 --> 00:42:40,358
credit card, flown on a plane.

645
00:42:40,518 --> 00:42:42,533
I ran his prints
through every database

646
00:42:42,534 --> 00:42:44,144
I can think of, no hits.

647
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,268
That's bullshit.

648
00:42:46,293 --> 00:42:48,144
This dude is former
military all day.

649
00:42:48,627 --> 00:42:50,236
No hits. I'm telling you.

650
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:51,411
Either he's never been printed,

651
00:42:51,412 --> 00:42:54,110
or Adam Clay doesn't exist.

652
00:42:55,416 --> 00:42:56,940
Which is terrifying to me

653
00:42:56,965 --> 00:42:58,879
because he's probably
in a classified program.

654
00:43:01,553 --> 00:43:02,945
Special Agent Wiley.

655
00:43:04,904 --> 00:43:06,049
Okay.

656
00:43:06,074 --> 00:43:07,597
- Let's go.
- What?

657
00:43:07,622 --> 00:43:09,927
- They found the guy, Garnett.
- What?

658
00:43:09,952 --> 00:43:11,998
- They found him. Let's go.
- Oh, shit.

659
00:43:14,827 --> 00:43:16,229
Jessica.

660
00:43:16,254 --> 00:43:17,894
<i>I think you know
why I'm calling.</i>

661
00:43:18,674 --> 00:43:21,024
You know, I'd do
anything for you.

662
00:43:21,973 --> 00:43:24,715
Anything for you.

663
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:26,851
Derek's scared shitless.

664
00:43:26,876 --> 00:43:28,574
I've never seen him this scared.

665
00:43:28,995 --> 00:43:31,234
Well, he's made his bed.

666
00:43:32,337 --> 00:43:34,209
I'll give you a board seat
on the holding company.

667
00:43:34,233 --> 00:43:35,979
That's another million a year.

668
00:43:36,004 --> 00:43:38,440
<i>Plus you promised
you'd take care of him.</i>

669
00:43:39,664 --> 00:43:42,493
Look, I don't need
that. I have enough.

670
00:43:43,249 --> 00:43:44,598
So you got this?

671
00:43:47,113 --> 00:43:48,941
Yeah. You have my word.

672
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:51,042
<i>Wallace...</i>

673
00:43:52,979 --> 00:43:54,432
I still think of you...

674
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:57,471
<i>sometimes.

675
00:43:57,698 --> 00:43:59,000
Sometimes.

676
00:44:14,974 --> 00:44:16,346
Why are you calling me

677
00:44:16,371 --> 00:44:17,845
on the "never call
this line" line?

678
00:44:17,846 --> 00:44:19,495
This is priority one, Janet.

679
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,564
Well, if it was priority
one, I would know about it.

680
00:44:21,589 --> 00:44:23,416
Look, I'm heading
downtown to a POTUS brief.

681
00:44:23,417 --> 00:44:24,462
<i>Just hear me out.</i>

682
00:44:24,487 --> 00:44:26,448
Now, you know who I
work for, don't you?

683
00:44:26,473 --> 00:44:28,517
<i>Oh, yeah. God
help you, Wallace.</i>

684
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:29,543
Exactly.

685
00:44:29,893 --> 00:44:31,741
Well, Director Harward,

686
00:44:31,766 --> 00:44:33,489
my young friend,
seems to have caught

687
00:44:33,514 --> 00:44:35,647
the unwanted attentions of...

688
00:44:36,338 --> 00:44:38,221
I don't know how
else to say this.

689
00:44:38,246 --> 00:44:39,422
Of a Beekeeper.

690
00:44:41,193 --> 00:44:43,978
Wait, a Beekeeper Beekeeper?

691
00:44:44,003 --> 00:44:45,352
As in.

692
00:44:45,842 --> 00:44:48,278
<i>- Well, that's not good.</i>
- No, it's not.

693
00:44:48,303 --> 00:44:51,132
- What's the body count?
<i>- Seven today.</i>

694
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,784
You busy making
funeral arrangements?

695
00:44:54,809 --> 00:44:57,159
I need help, Janet. Not jokes.

696
00:45:04,608 --> 00:45:05,729
Is that Garnett?

697
00:45:05,807 --> 00:45:07,809
He was strapped
to an old pickup.

698
00:45:08,713 --> 00:45:09,854
Check this out.

699
00:45:27,176 --> 00:45:29,701
Does this mean you've
taken pity on an old man?

700
00:45:30,484 --> 00:45:34,183
So your problem? He's
retired from the program.

701
00:45:34,836 --> 00:45:36,190
No longer active.

702
00:45:38,536 --> 00:45:40,538
Well, that changes everything.

703
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,462
The current active Beekeeper
is aware of the issue

704
00:45:43,487 --> 00:45:45,183
and is going to be
taking things from here.

705
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:46,861
You can rest easy, old friend.

706
00:45:46,886 --> 00:45:48,148
<i>Oh, no. Janet.</i>

707
00:45:48,633 --> 00:45:51,112
The current active Beekeeper
is a fucking lunatic

708
00:45:51,137 --> 00:45:53,182
<i>who should have been
removed months ago.</i>

709
00:45:53,207 --> 00:45:54,729
God help us now.

710
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:36,174
Get out of here!

711
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,081
Shit!

712
00:46:44,254 --> 00:46:46,343
- Excuse me.
- You're cool.

713
00:47:06,956 --> 00:47:08,668
You've been a busy bee.

714
00:47:08,669 --> 00:47:10,539
You're supposed to be retired.

715
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:12,412
I'm assuming you're
my replacement.

716
00:47:44,479 --> 00:47:46,322
Fuck you!

717
00:48:39,891 --> 00:48:41,196
I need your keys.

718
00:48:56,928 --> 00:48:58,364
There's an issue.

719
00:48:59,214 --> 00:49:00,738
The problem has not been solved.

720
00:49:02,261 --> 00:49:03,262
Well...

721
00:49:05,003 --> 00:49:06,831
That is a surprise.

722
00:49:07,657 --> 00:49:09,615
The Beekeepers have
studied the situation

723
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:11,948
and have decided
to remain neutral.

724
00:49:12,271 --> 00:49:14,054
How can they do that?

725
00:49:14,055 --> 00:49:16,057
He was their man,
for fuck's sake!

726
00:49:16,492 --> 00:49:18,016
<i>I'm sorry, Wallace.</i>

727
00:49:19,017 --> 00:49:20,279
You're on your own.

728
00:49:23,232 --> 00:49:25,016
I thought you could
fucking handle this.

729
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:26,607
I can handle this!

730
00:49:40,168 --> 00:49:41,300
Thank you.

731
00:49:42,301 --> 00:49:43,911
What you got for us, Detective?

732
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,999
That's her vehicle,

733
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,349
registered to a
Anisette Landress.

734
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:51,613
The ATF are en route
inbound to take care of it.

735
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:53,312
We're way cooler than ATF.

736
00:49:54,052 --> 00:49:55,690
I'll show you why I called them.

737
00:50:02,408 --> 00:50:03,756
That's a Minigun.

738
00:50:03,757 --> 00:50:05,865
They use those on
military vehicles.

739
00:50:05,890 --> 00:50:08,457
Did you know that puppy
shoots 6,000 rounds a minute?

740
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,458
I know.

741
00:50:10,459 --> 00:50:12,157
Did you know that's
100 rounds a second?

742
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:13,811
Yep, I know.

743
00:50:15,073 --> 00:50:16,813
Did you know that
you know a lot?

744
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:18,292
Yes, I do.

745
00:50:18,293 --> 00:50:19,246
It's because I minored in math.

746
00:50:19,271 --> 00:50:20,794
I'm a pretty smart guy actually.

747
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:23,043
Okay, then, do you know
who Anisette Landress is?

748
00:50:23,068 --> 00:50:24,982
- Yes, I do.
- Go ahead and tell me.

749
00:50:25,007 --> 00:50:26,834
Someone who doesn't exist

750
00:50:26,867 --> 00:50:29,173
in any commercial or
government database.

751
00:50:29,174 --> 00:50:30,522
Someone who's a ghost.

752
00:50:30,523 --> 00:50:32,830
Like our good friend Adam Clay.

753
00:50:34,919 --> 00:50:37,621
<i>"Beekeeping for Beekeepers."</i>

754
00:50:38,705 --> 00:50:40,184
Here's another reason

755
00:50:40,185 --> 00:50:41,340
that Anisette Landress

756
00:50:41,365 --> 00:50:42,970
is like our good
friend Adam Clay.

757
00:50:45,407 --> 00:50:46,844
Do you know what's that way?

758
00:50:47,888 --> 00:50:49,699
Springfield...

759
00:50:50,499 --> 00:50:52,371
where the call
center was torched.

760
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:55,699
And that way where
Adam Clay's headed?

761
00:50:57,419 --> 00:50:58,507
Boston.

762
00:50:59,633 --> 00:51:00,765
Let's go.

763
00:51:02,555 --> 00:51:03,746
Thank you.

764
00:51:18,864 --> 00:51:20,082
How are you, my friend?

765
00:51:20,107 --> 00:51:22,021
- Good to see you, sir.
- Good to see you.

766
00:51:22,053 --> 00:51:24,045
Yeah, come on,

767
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,559
leave them alone.
Leave them alone.

768
00:51:25,584 --> 00:51:27,535
Don't play with those
things. They go off.

769
00:51:27,536 --> 00:51:29,147
Sit down. Make
yourself comfortable.

770
00:51:32,063 --> 00:51:34,630
When I was sworn in as director,

771
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:39,069
I was read into programs
I never imagined existed.

772
00:51:41,202 --> 00:51:42,421
Well...

773
00:51:43,988 --> 00:51:48,644
there are programs
even I wasn't privy to.

774
00:51:50,255 --> 00:51:51,821
Like the Beekeepers.

775
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:56,825
The honeybee has always

776
00:51:56,826 --> 00:51:58,915
had a special relationship
with humanity.

777
00:51:58,916 --> 00:52:00,439
A sacred relationship.

778
00:52:01,353 --> 00:52:04,050
Why? No bees, no agriculture.

779
00:52:04,051 --> 00:52:06,227
No agriculture, no civilization.

780
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:10,535
Our nation is not
unlike a beehive,

781
00:52:10,536 --> 00:52:13,712
with its complex
systems of workers,

782
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,714
caretakers, even royalty.

783
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:19,848
If any of the beehive's
complex mechanisms

784
00:52:19,849 --> 00:52:21,696
are compromised,

785
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:24,397
the hive collapses.

786
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:26,986
Someone a long time ago decided

787
00:52:26,987 --> 00:52:29,206
that a mechanism was needed

788
00:52:29,207 --> 00:52:30,600
to keep our nation safe.

789
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:33,253
A mechanism outside
the chain of command,

790
00:52:33,254 --> 00:52:36,459
outside the system.

791
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:41,741
Its one mission, to
keep the system safe.

792
00:52:42,394 --> 00:52:45,483
Beekeepers are
given all resources,

793
00:52:45,484 --> 00:52:49,704
empowered to act on
their own judgment.

794
00:52:49,705 --> 00:52:52,185
For decades, they
have quietly worked

795
00:52:52,186 --> 00:52:54,449
to keep the hive safe.

796
00:52:55,494 --> 00:52:57,844
That is, until now.

797
00:52:59,193 --> 00:53:02,065
It appears that a
retired Beekeeper

798
00:53:02,066 --> 00:53:03,457
has gone off program

799
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:06,256
and is acting in what
he mistakenly believes

800
00:53:06,281 --> 00:53:08,675
is the hive's best interest.

801
00:53:09,256 --> 00:53:10,960
Can't somebody just
pick up the phone

802
00:53:10,985 --> 00:53:13,116
and tell this yahoo to
stand-the-fuck down?

803
00:53:13,141 --> 00:53:15,360
That's the one thing
Beekeepers don't do.

804
00:53:15,688 --> 00:53:17,081
Stand down.

805
00:53:17,472 --> 00:53:19,647
Not unlike bees themselves,

806
00:53:19,648 --> 00:53:23,260
Beekeepers keep
working until they die.

807
00:53:23,261 --> 00:53:25,044
So he's basically one of us.

808
00:53:25,045 --> 00:53:28,134
No. He's not like you.

809
00:53:28,135 --> 00:53:29,832
You're tier one operators,

810
00:53:30,572 --> 00:53:33,010
former SEAL Team
Six, Delta Group.

811
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:38,188
You are, in other
words, pussies.

812
00:53:38,189 --> 00:53:40,277
If you were in the same room,

813
00:53:40,278 --> 00:53:41,409
he would kill you.

814
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:46,413
With enough of you, then
maybe you just might

815
00:53:46,414 --> 00:53:48,894
in fact be able to kill him

816
00:53:48,895 --> 00:53:51,070
before he accomplishes his goal.

817
00:53:51,071 --> 00:53:52,420
What would that be?

818
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:56,990
To kill his way to
the top of the hive.

819
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:02,604
Mr. Pettis, you should
get your people moving.

820
00:54:11,091 --> 00:54:13,266
Dude, bees are
interesting little shits.

821
00:54:13,267 --> 00:54:14,561
Did you know that?

822
00:54:14,586 --> 00:54:16,748
I know they pollinate
a bunch of shit

823
00:54:16,749 --> 00:54:18,141
and we'd be fucked without them.

824
00:54:18,142 --> 00:54:19,142
Listen.

825
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,318
"Some bees are queen slayers,

826
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:22,884
"which will rise up
and kill their queen

827
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:24,076
"if she fails to produce

828
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:26,373
"the right kind of
male offspring."

829
00:54:27,107 --> 00:54:28,499
Fascinating.

830
00:54:29,718 --> 00:54:31,719
- No.
- Hm. Nope.

831
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,944
- No.
- No!

832
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,569
- It's your turn. You can't...
- No!

833
00:54:41,295 --> 00:54:42,818
Special Agent Parker.

834
00:54:44,807 --> 00:54:46,053
Yeah.

835
00:54:46,605 --> 00:54:47,822
Okay.

836
00:54:47,823 --> 00:54:48,824
Thank you.

837
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,525
What?

838
00:54:55,092 --> 00:54:57,442
The deputy director is
flying up from DC to see us.

839
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:03,655
Oh, fuck. This is your fault.

840
00:56:35,627 --> 00:56:37,584
Here's another
interesting factoid.

841
00:56:37,585 --> 00:56:38,933
Thank fuck.

842
00:56:38,934 --> 00:56:40,979
You know, I was getting
sick of enjoying

843
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,420
my peaceful thoughts.

844
00:56:45,709 --> 00:56:46,767
Sir.

845
00:56:46,768 --> 00:56:48,421
Sir, this is Special
Agent Parker,

846
00:56:48,422 --> 00:56:49,683
Special Agent Wiley.

847
00:56:49,684 --> 00:56:51,207
They'll be briefing you.

848
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:52,643
This is Deputy Director Prigg

849
00:56:52,644 --> 00:56:55,080
and Amanda Munoz,
special counsel.

850
00:56:55,081 --> 00:56:56,889
Mr. Deputy Director,

851
00:56:57,126 --> 00:56:58,649
my colleague and I believe

852
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,694
that three major crime
scenes in our area

853
00:57:00,695 --> 00:57:02,609
are connected to
a single subject.

854
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:03,697
Adam Clay.

855
00:57:03,698 --> 00:57:05,177
He killed six people today.

856
00:57:05,178 --> 00:57:07,875
Based on the extensive
use of tradecraft

857
00:57:07,876 --> 00:57:09,984
and the nature of his alias,

858
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:11,488
we believe that
Mr. Clay is connected

859
00:57:11,489 --> 00:57:13,882
to a classified program
named Beekeeper.

860
00:57:14,535 --> 00:57:16,667
A program that none of
our partner agencies

861
00:57:16,668 --> 00:57:17,843
seem willing to acknowledge.

862
00:57:17,868 --> 00:57:20,282
Let's stick to what we
know, Special Agent Parker.

863
00:57:21,072 --> 00:57:22,291
Yes, sir.

864
00:57:22,316 --> 00:57:25,337
In any event, this
individual is highly capable

865
00:57:25,362 --> 00:57:27,029
and extremely motivated,

866
00:57:27,185 --> 00:57:29,055
and we believe that he's
on his way to Boston,

867
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,472
if not already here.

868
00:57:30,497 --> 00:57:33,586
And we believe that
this is his next target,

869
00:57:33,611 --> 00:57:35,133
Nine Star United,

870
00:57:35,164 --> 00:57:36,787
which appears to be the entity

871
00:57:36,812 --> 00:57:38,378
operating the
regional call centers,

872
00:57:38,403 --> 00:57:40,231
like the one that
Mr. Clay burned down.

873
00:57:40,866 --> 00:57:43,260
Why is Adam Clay
on this rampage?

874
00:57:44,609 --> 00:57:48,569
He's, um, protecting
the hive, sir.

875
00:57:49,222 --> 00:57:50,484
It's what Beekeepers do.

876
00:57:51,006 --> 00:57:52,725
I have enough to
brief the director.

877
00:57:53,444 --> 00:57:55,314
- What's your ask?
- My ask?

878
00:57:55,315 --> 00:57:58,989
Uh, well, a SWAT
team, for starters.

879
00:57:59,014 --> 00:58:01,626
Surveillance support,
additional agents, analysts.

880
00:58:02,453 --> 00:58:03,845
That shouldn't be a problem.

881
00:58:04,237 --> 00:58:05,238
Thank you.

882
00:58:12,941 --> 00:58:15,117
- Did that just happen?
- Yeah.

883
00:58:22,037 --> 00:58:23,255
All right.
Everybody, listen up.

884
00:58:23,256 --> 00:58:24,517
It's roll call time.

885
00:58:24,518 --> 00:58:26,867
I'm getting ready for
my dick to get hard

886
00:58:26,868 --> 00:58:29,566
with some wonderful,
beautiful numbers.

887
00:58:29,567 --> 00:58:31,481
Let's start with
Phoenix. Where we at?

888
00:58:31,482 --> 00:58:33,570
Phoenix is up 201K.

889
00:58:33,571 --> 00:58:35,963
200K, I'm gonna suck
your dick. I love you.

890
00:58:35,964 --> 00:58:37,835
New Orleans, show me,

891
00:58:37,836 --> 00:58:39,402
tell me. Where we at?

892
00:58:39,403 --> 00:58:40,794
It's down 93K, boss.

893
00:58:40,795 --> 00:58:42,796
Down? You're a fucking loser.

894
00:58:42,821 --> 00:58:44,311
You give me a fucking headache.

895
00:58:44,336 --> 00:58:45,692
You give me fucking cancer.

896
00:58:45,717 --> 00:58:47,801
New York, make me
happy. I beg you.

897
00:58:47,802 --> 00:58:50,850
New York City's up 64 ASCOT.

898
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:53,486
Yeah! I love you, New York!

899
00:59:00,685 --> 00:59:02,381
Gather around!

900
00:59:02,382 --> 00:59:04,252
I want all weapons
front on entry.

901
00:59:04,253 --> 00:59:05,950
- Everybody give me an oos!
- Oos!

902
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:07,038
Let's go!

903
00:59:12,087 --> 00:59:15,046
Power down, my federal
friend. Power down.

904
00:59:15,047 --> 00:59:17,309
Private security here on
the orders of the Governor.

905
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:19,311
State Department
certified to carry weapons

906
00:59:19,312 --> 00:59:20,400
in all 50 states.

907
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:23,489
Feel free to call the
highlighted numbers

908
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:24,622
to verify.

909
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:27,407
You're not welcome
here. Get the fuck out.

910
00:59:28,539 --> 00:59:30,192
All right, boys, let's go!

911
00:59:32,499 --> 00:59:34,371
Set up a perimeter outside.

912
00:59:34,936 --> 00:59:37,590
Your goals, they mean bonuses.

913
00:59:37,591 --> 00:59:39,990
Money, money, money,
we fucking love it.

914
00:59:41,026 --> 00:59:43,217
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the fuck?

915
00:59:43,242 --> 00:59:45,330
Who the fuck are you?
You can't be in here.

916
00:59:45,355 --> 00:59:47,182
We're the guys
keeping you alive.

917
00:59:47,207 --> 00:59:48,599
Shut it down now.

918
00:59:48,646 --> 00:59:50,255
Everybody, listen up.

919
00:59:50,256 --> 00:59:51,654
Anyone who's not
carrying a weapon,

920
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,201
get the fuck out!

921
00:59:53,226 --> 00:59:54,715
Shouldn't you be killing
bin Laden or something?

922
00:59:54,739 --> 00:59:58,437
Listen to me, my friend.
This place prints money.

923
00:59:58,438 --> 01:00:00,221
No one's shutting down.

924
01:00:00,222 --> 01:00:03,661
Anybody so much as puts a
phone down, they're fired!

925
01:00:04,614 --> 01:00:05,875
I'm sorry to break it to you,

926
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,466
but bin Laden's been
dead for a while.

927
01:00:07,491 --> 01:00:09,796
So I'm going to say
this one last time.

928
01:00:09,797 --> 01:00:11,059
Shut it down.

929
01:00:12,017 --> 01:00:13,506
The fuck I am.

930
01:00:13,932 --> 01:00:15,976
Call your fucking boss.

931
01:00:15,977 --> 01:00:17,576
You want me to call my boss?

932
01:00:18,351 --> 01:00:19,395
I'll do that.

933
01:00:19,851 --> 01:00:24,290
And you'll be so fucked,
it's gonna be beautiful.

934
01:00:26,118 --> 01:00:27,652
Don't be shy. Come on.

935
01:00:28,773 --> 01:00:30,556
What about the parking garage?

936
01:00:30,557 --> 01:00:32,471
Closed and locked. Steel gate.

937
01:00:32,472 --> 01:00:34,332
I want a body on
comms watching it.

938
01:00:34,692 --> 01:00:36,562
- Delivery dock?
- Same deal.

939
01:00:36,563 --> 01:00:38,521
- Station an agent there too.
- Yes, sir.

940
01:00:38,522 --> 01:00:40,653
Sure there's no back
entrances into this place?

941
01:00:40,654 --> 01:00:42,133
Hey, there're no
other entrances.

942
01:00:42,134 --> 01:00:44,440
Federal law enforcement
operation in progress.

943
01:00:44,441 --> 01:00:45,702
Move along at a minimum retreat

944
01:00:45,703 --> 01:00:47,138
to a safe distance. Thank you.

945
01:00:47,139 --> 01:00:48,574
Someone scout the
service tunnel.

946
01:00:48,575 --> 01:00:51,490
The other option,
instead of going in

947
01:00:51,491 --> 01:00:52,839
is to smoke them out.

948
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,145
Excuse me?

949
01:00:54,146 --> 01:00:56,340
I figured I'd give the
firefighters a break.

950
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:58,976
I've put them through
enough already.

951
01:00:58,977 --> 01:01:00,543
What'd you say your name was?

952
01:01:00,544 --> 01:01:02,154
Currently I go by Adam Clay.

953
01:01:02,807 --> 01:01:04,764
Trust me, if there
was a back entrance,

954
01:01:04,765 --> 01:01:06,026
I would've used it.

955
01:01:06,027 --> 01:01:07,506
I don't want to injure anyone

956
01:01:07,507 --> 01:01:08,787
who's innocent and non-involved.

957
01:01:09,814 --> 01:01:11,293
But it is what it is.

958
01:01:11,859 --> 01:01:13,425
Somebody detain this guy!

959
01:01:39,725 --> 01:01:41,253
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

960
01:01:51,638 --> 01:01:53,465
Oh, wow, if it isn't the fucking

961
01:01:53,466 --> 01:01:54,858
golden goose himself.

962
01:01:54,859 --> 01:01:56,555
Sir, I got Captain Caveman here

963
01:01:56,556 --> 01:01:58,609
telling me to send
everyone home.

964
01:01:58,634 --> 01:01:59,382
If we do that,

965
01:01:59,407 --> 01:02:01,517
we're walking away
from a lot of money.

966
01:02:01,674 --> 01:02:03,240
Mm. Put him on.

967
01:02:04,415 --> 01:02:05,460
It's for you.

968
01:02:07,045 --> 01:02:08,828
Why are you fucking
with my business?

969
01:02:08,829 --> 01:02:10,613
Because Mr. Westwyld hired me

970
01:02:10,614 --> 01:02:12,659
to kick some fucking
Beekeeper's ass.

971
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,574
Mr. Westwyld works for me,

972
01:02:15,575 --> 01:02:18,156
which means that
you work for me.

973
01:02:18,341 --> 01:02:19,559
Now, listen, that place

974
01:02:19,584 --> 01:02:22,015
is the crown jewel
of my kingdom.

975
01:02:22,277 --> 01:02:23,713
I'm not gonna let
some crash test dummy

976
01:02:23,714 --> 01:02:25,105
with a fucking gun fuck it up.

977
01:02:25,106 --> 01:02:26,593
Is that clear, Mr. Pettis?

978
01:02:26,618 --> 01:02:28,108
Didn't this character
already burn

979
01:02:28,109 --> 01:02:29,588
one of your centers
to the ground?

980
01:02:29,589 --> 01:02:31,459
Well, you know, they
didn't have you,

981
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:32,722
and that's why.

982
01:02:32,723 --> 01:02:34,898
So maybe you just
do your fucking job

983
01:02:34,899 --> 01:02:37,030
and don't tell me how
to do mine, please.

984
01:02:37,031 --> 01:02:39,116
<i>- We got it?</i>
- Copy that.

985
01:02:40,992 --> 01:02:43,515
Fall out. Set up a
perimeter outside.

986
01:02:43,516 --> 01:02:44,951
Let's go. Move!

987
01:02:44,952 --> 01:02:46,593
Round of applause.

988
01:02:46,618 --> 01:02:48,532
Let's say goodbye
to our good friends.

989
01:02:48,557 --> 01:02:52,108
Bye-bye, Admiral. Go
join fucking Space Force.

990
01:02:52,133 --> 01:02:55,614
You are beautiful.
Now get the fuck out!

991
01:02:55,615 --> 01:02:57,050
Keep walking.

992
01:02:57,051 --> 01:02:58,575
Bye-bye, dickhead.

993
01:02:59,793 --> 01:03:02,273
What a bunch of jackoffs.

994
01:03:02,274 --> 01:03:03,971
Yeah, we love you!

995
01:03:14,765 --> 01:03:16,374
One time amnesty.

996
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,984
Whoever doesn't want
to die this evening,

997
01:03:17,985 --> 01:03:21,607
can in an orderly
fashion leave now.

998
01:03:21,632 --> 01:03:24,045
Uh, uh, uh. No fucking
way. It's not happening.

999
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:25,601
Anybody moves, you're fired.

1000
01:03:25,602 --> 01:03:27,994
- No bonus, vesting, two weeks.
- Come on, boys! Move, move!

1001
01:03:27,995 --> 01:03:29,083
Nada. Zero!

1002
01:03:29,848 --> 01:03:31,501
Are you fucking nuts?

1003
01:03:31,526 --> 01:03:33,124
Each one of these
pricks is worth

1004
01:03:33,149 --> 01:03:35,248
30 to 40 million
a year in profit.

1005
01:03:35,273 --> 01:03:37,980
So no one is shooting no guns.

1006
01:03:38,005 --> 01:03:40,485
Not a good day to drag
innocent people into this.

1007
01:03:40,486 --> 01:03:42,400
These assholes?
They're not innocent.

1008
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,620
For either one of us
to close that distance,

1009
01:03:44,621 --> 01:03:46,317
some of them will get hurt.

1010
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:48,146
Let's start with this
prick right here.

1011
01:04:03,117 --> 01:04:04,249
On me!

1012
01:04:13,345 --> 01:04:14,476
Take right!

1013
01:04:29,796 --> 01:04:31,189
Pettis, we got a man down.

1014
01:04:53,031 --> 01:04:54,843
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1015
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,322
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1016
01:05:04,918 --> 01:05:06,874
You know who you're working for?

1017
01:05:07,269 --> 01:05:08,879
None of my fucking business.

1018
01:05:08,904 --> 01:05:10,906
I'm just the guy they call
when there's a problem.

1019
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:16,935
And you are our problem.

1020
01:05:17,426 --> 01:05:19,297
Goddamn right, I'm a problem.

1021
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:44,175
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1022
01:05:46,307 --> 01:05:48,221
<i>Fire. Fire.</i>

1023
01:05:58,276 --> 01:06:00,002
Dan, what the hell happened?

1024
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:01,506
Any dead?

1025
01:06:01,531 --> 01:06:03,357
Not dead, but we got
our asses kicked.

1026
01:06:03,585 --> 01:06:06,109
- Our guy. What do we know?
- He's in the building.

1027
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:07,502
I'm waiting more men to roll in.

1028
01:06:07,981 --> 01:06:09,373
I don't know what this guy is,

1029
01:06:09,374 --> 01:06:10,896
but nobody can do
what he's done.

1030
01:06:10,897 --> 01:06:12,725
He's just a Beekeeper.

1031
01:06:13,944 --> 01:06:15,206
Bad idea.

1032
01:06:16,737 --> 01:06:17,868
I'm not waiting.

1033
01:06:17,893 --> 01:06:19,197
- V, wait!
- Move!

1034
01:06:19,253 --> 01:06:20,572
Come on, Wiley, keep up.

1035
01:06:21,038 --> 01:06:22,126
Fuck.

1036
01:06:35,487 --> 01:06:36,793
We got him!

1037
01:06:48,021 --> 01:06:49,762
- You done?
- Reload.

1038
01:06:55,894 --> 01:06:57,199
Everybody out!

1039
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:10,228
You're done.

1040
01:07:27,234 --> 01:07:28,635
We should take the stairs.

1041
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:29,846
Smart.

1042
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:32,718
<i>Subject is in the hallway.</i>

1043
01:07:34,221 --> 01:07:36,504
<i>Command, report back.
Anybody on comm?</i>

1044
01:07:47,602 --> 01:07:49,647
Please, please don't kill me.

1045
01:07:49,648 --> 01:07:53,043
I'm just a middle manager.
I never hurt nobody.

1046
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:55,305
I'd respect you more
if you look people

1047
01:07:55,306 --> 01:07:57,308
in their eyes when
you steal from them.

1048
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:11,341
Now, you're making
a lot of money here.

1049
01:08:11,971 --> 01:08:13,732
Tell me where it's all going.

1050
01:08:14,175 --> 01:08:15,176
I don't know, man.

1051
01:08:19,358 --> 01:08:21,011
I know you're the middle man.

1052
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:25,104
- Who's above you?
- No. They'll kill me.

1053
01:08:28,948 --> 01:08:30,731
I'll torture you, then kill you.

1054
01:08:36,343 --> 01:08:37,735
Come on, guys. You got it.

1055
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,022
Wiley, get your ass up here!

1056
01:08:40,046 --> 01:08:42,961
Yeah, well, I'm not an Olympian.

1057
01:08:42,962 --> 01:08:44,424
Make it stop.

1058
01:08:44,877 --> 01:08:46,416
You can make it stop.

1059
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:49,402
You've stolen
hundreds of millions

1060
01:08:49,403 --> 01:08:50,708
from people who've done nothing

1061
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:52,102
but work hard all their lives.

1062
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:59,266
She was an educator, a mom.

1063
01:08:59,291 --> 01:09:01,554
Dedicated her whole
life to helping people.

1064
01:09:03,809 --> 01:09:05,666
Yesterday, she shot herself

1065
01:09:06,768 --> 01:09:09,249
because you took two million
from a charity she ran.

1066
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:16,996
She was the only person
who ever took care of me.

1067
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,580
Who and where, Mr. Anzalone?

1068
01:09:24,047 --> 01:09:26,135
- Tell me who and where.
- I can't.

1069
01:09:26,136 --> 01:09:27,353
Look, these people,

1070
01:09:27,354 --> 01:09:28,861
they're untouchable.
I can't...

1071
01:09:28,886 --> 01:09:31,454
No, please! Please!
Stop! I will! I will!

1072
01:09:31,921 --> 01:09:34,127
Let me show you.
Let me show you.

1073
01:09:52,379 --> 01:09:53,990
I told you they
were untouchable.

1074
01:09:55,992 --> 01:09:57,564
Nobody's untouchable.

1075
01:10:01,432 --> 01:10:03,682
Sometimes when the
hive's out of balance...

1076
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:07,635
you have to replace the queen.

1077
01:10:13,149 --> 01:10:14,338
Clay!

1078
01:10:17,448 --> 01:10:19,362
That man is directly responsible

1079
01:10:19,363 --> 01:10:20,752
for your mother's death.

1080
01:10:24,107 --> 01:10:25,369
I believe you.

1081
01:10:26,109 --> 01:10:28,241
But we have laws
for these things.

1082
01:10:31,244 --> 01:10:33,638
You have laws for these
things until they fail.

1083
01:10:35,727 --> 01:10:36,902
Then you have me.

1084
01:10:47,115 --> 01:10:48,464
Arrest him!

1085
01:10:48,635 --> 01:10:51,046
On your feet before I blow
your fucking head off.

1086
01:10:51,047 --> 01:10:53,091
I just been thrown through
a plate glass window.

1087
01:10:53,092 --> 01:10:54,180
Shut your fucking mouth!

1088
01:11:07,618 --> 01:11:09,620
Whoa. I have four kids.

1089
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:14,119
I know. Three boys and a girl.

1090
01:11:26,386 --> 01:11:28,648
Wiley? You okay?

1091
01:11:28,649 --> 01:11:30,520
- Yeah. He went that way.
- You okay?

1092
01:11:30,521 --> 01:11:31,912
- Have you been hit?
- My wife thinks

1093
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:33,218
I'm doing computer nerd shit.

1094
01:11:33,219 --> 01:11:34,417
Well, I won't tell
her if you don't.

1095
01:11:34,441 --> 01:11:36,047
- Have you been hit?
- No, I'm good, Mom.

1096
01:11:36,048 --> 01:11:37,309
Did you get him?

1097
01:11:37,310 --> 01:11:39,137
- Did you?
- No, he's tricky.

1098
01:11:39,138 --> 01:11:40,834
- Get up. You okay?
- Almost, but...

1099
01:11:40,835 --> 01:11:42,358
I guess that's just evidence.

1100
01:11:42,359 --> 01:11:44,643
- Can I borrow your gun?
- Yeah. Let's go.

1101
01:11:44,668 --> 01:11:46,697
- On me. On me. On me. On me.
- Clear!

1102
01:11:54,298 --> 01:11:56,082
I want interviews
with all of them.

1103
01:12:02,466 --> 01:12:03,775
We're going to talk.

1104
01:12:04,424 --> 01:12:05,658
Get him out of here.

1105
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:24,270
Wiley.

1106
01:12:31,886 --> 01:12:32,931
Holy shit.

1107
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,551
Do you mind if I ask you

1108
01:12:45,576 --> 01:12:47,150
a really boring question?

1109
01:12:47,424 --> 01:12:50,080
Do you actually prefer
the money or the power?

1110
01:12:50,470 --> 01:12:51,601
Mm.

1111
01:12:51,602 --> 01:12:52,873
That's deep.

1112
01:12:52,898 --> 01:12:55,058
Oh, I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

1113
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:59,348
Oh, God. Uh...

1114
01:12:59,349 --> 01:13:01,351
Would you excuse me for
a moment? Come upstairs.

1115
01:13:05,311 --> 01:13:08,095
<i>You said these guys were
the fucking best. Uh...</i>

1116
01:13:08,096 --> 01:13:09,141
Why are they all dead?

1117
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:11,591
You kicked the beehive

1118
01:13:11,616 --> 01:13:13,792
and now we have to
reap the whirlwind.

1119
01:13:16,049 --> 01:13:18,225
- Unless...
- Unless.

1120
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:20,346
Unless, unless,
unless fucking what?

1121
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:23,459
Maybe now is the time
to call your mother.

1122
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:27,804
I'm paying you so
much fucking money

1123
01:13:27,829 --> 01:13:29,572
and your advice is
to call my mother?

1124
01:13:30,336 --> 01:13:33,251
He can't make his move on us

1125
01:13:33,252 --> 01:13:36,078
if we're in her
proximity, can he?

1126
01:13:36,103 --> 01:13:37,256
Her people.

1127
01:13:44,568 --> 01:13:45,846
You're a fuck.

1128
01:13:46,309 --> 01:13:47,815
- You're scared...
- I certainly am scared.

1129
01:13:47,839 --> 01:13:49,311
And you want to use my mother

1130
01:13:49,312 --> 01:13:50,486
as a human shield.

1131
01:13:50,487 --> 01:13:52,576
Just call her. Just
call her. Come on.

1132
01:13:53,446 --> 01:13:55,142
It's not a game now.

1133
01:13:55,143 --> 01:13:56,455
Oh, it's all a game.

1134
01:13:56,754 --> 01:13:58,103
Come on.

1135
01:13:58,843 --> 01:14:00,583
Yes, Derek. What do you want?

1136
01:14:00,584 --> 01:14:02,585
<i>Hey, Mom. No, nothing.</i>

1137
01:14:02,586 --> 01:14:04,413
<i>I was just, you know,
thinking about you.</i>

1138
01:14:04,414 --> 01:14:07,314
<i>I miss you. I was hoping to
maybe see you this weekend.</i>

1139
01:14:07,595 --> 01:14:08,943
I'm at the beach house.

1140
01:14:08,968 --> 01:14:10,580
You're welcome to
join if you behave.

1141
01:14:11,116 --> 01:14:13,160
<i>I would love to. And, hey,
I actually was going to,</i>

1142
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:14,464
<i>you know, get together
with some of my</i>

1143
01:14:14,488 --> 01:14:15,946
<i>tech homies and
stuff, if that's, uh,</i>

1144
01:14:15,947 --> 01:14:17,382
<i>if that's cool with you.</i>

1145
01:14:17,383 --> 01:14:18,861
Fine. No drugs.

1146
01:14:18,886 --> 01:14:21,041
Give Kelly the details.
Love you. Have to go.

1147
01:14:22,277 --> 01:14:23,625
Derek's joining me this weekend.

1148
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:24,911
Help me keep him sober.

1149
01:14:24,912 --> 01:14:26,349
Yes, ma'am. I
love babysitting.

1150
01:14:26,914 --> 01:14:28,741
Madame President, Funmi Lawal.

1151
01:14:28,742 --> 01:14:30,482
Hello. Good to meet you.

1152
01:14:30,483 --> 01:14:31,705
Sola Oyemade.

1153
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:33,209
Sola, thank you so
much for coming.

1154
01:14:33,234 --> 01:14:34,525
Susan Aneno.

1155
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,290
Thank you so much for
coming all this way.

1156
01:14:36,315 --> 01:14:37,447
Oli Ray-Imanuel.

1157
01:14:37,472 --> 01:14:39,672
- Oli, how good to meet you.
- Great to meet you, ma'am.

1158
01:14:46,804 --> 01:14:48,877
You don't have to
do this, you know?

1159
01:14:50,242 --> 01:14:52,150
Why not let Clay do his thing?

1160
01:14:54,246 --> 01:14:56,533
Your mom is dead
because of these people.

1161
01:15:04,648 --> 01:15:06,018
Wherever it's headed...

1162
01:15:07,651 --> 01:15:08,739
I swore an oath.

1163
01:15:10,001 --> 01:15:12,220
I can't stand by
and watch it happen.

1164
01:15:19,532 --> 01:15:20,707
Even if he's right?

1165
01:15:27,018 --> 01:15:28,106
Even if he's right.

1166
01:15:30,804 --> 01:15:33,502
<i>Apologies. Damn
plane was delayed.</i>

1167
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,643
<i>What have you got?</i>

1168
01:15:35,069 --> 01:15:38,333
We think we have a sense of
Mr. Clay's true intentions.

1169
01:15:38,334 --> 01:15:40,727
He seems to be
following the money.

1170
01:15:41,772 --> 01:15:43,034
<i>What money is that?</i>

1171
01:15:43,556 --> 01:15:46,732
Usually it's from people
with no heirs, no family.

1172
01:15:46,733 --> 01:15:49,387
Nine Star United uses
data mining software

1173
01:15:49,388 --> 01:15:53,149
to identify these people and
then target their assets.

1174
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:56,020
There's another
company involved, sir,

1175
01:15:56,045 --> 01:15:58,788
a company who is a vendor to
the intelligence community

1176
01:15:58,789 --> 01:16:00,180
and to the Justice Department.

1177
01:16:00,181 --> 01:16:02,313
In fact, we use this
company's software

1178
01:16:02,314 --> 01:16:03,923
in this very office

1179
01:16:03,924 --> 01:16:06,492
to identify financial fraud.

1180
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,473
<i>Are you going to tell me
the name of this company?</i>

1181
01:16:15,893 --> 01:16:18,155
Danforth Enterprises.

1182
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:21,506
With an annual revenue
of $10 billion,

1183
01:16:21,507 --> 01:16:25,554
founded and operated
by Jessica Danforth,

1184
01:16:25,555 --> 01:16:28,034
who recently stepped down
because she was sworn in

1185
01:16:28,035 --> 01:16:31,100
as President of
the United States.

1186
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:32,952
<i>She self-financed her campaign.</i>

1187
01:16:32,953 --> 01:16:35,652
Yeah. None of that
money was clean.

1188
01:16:36,043 --> 01:16:37,305
<i>Who else knows this?</i>

1189
01:16:38,785 --> 01:16:40,090
Us three.

1190
01:16:40,091 --> 01:16:42,614
I have a really bad memory, sir.

1191
01:16:42,615 --> 01:16:45,617
<i>Let's, uh, keep
the circle small,</i>

1192
01:16:45,618 --> 01:16:47,880
<i>until I can brief the director
and the attorney general.</i>

1193
01:16:47,881 --> 01:16:49,882
<i>Not a word of this to
anyone. Understood?</i>

1194
01:16:49,883 --> 01:16:50,911
Yes, sir.

1195
01:16:50,936 --> 01:16:52,842
<i>And, Mr. Clay, I
see his kill count</i>

1196
01:16:52,843 --> 01:16:54,409
<i>is steadily rising.</i>

1197
01:16:54,410 --> 01:16:55,714
In a beehive, there is something

1198
01:16:55,715 --> 01:16:57,195
called a "queen slayer."

1199
01:16:57,587 --> 01:17:01,261
It's a bee that will rise
up and kill the queen

1200
01:17:01,286 --> 01:17:03,896
if she produces
defective offspring.

1201
01:17:03,897 --> 01:17:06,333
<i>I thought we were sticking
to the known knowns.</i>

1202
01:17:06,817 --> 01:17:09,380
Right. Yes. Not that
Beekeepers exist.

1203
01:17:09,381 --> 01:17:12,383
But Mr. Clay does
keep honey bees.

1204
01:17:12,384 --> 01:17:14,472
He admires their willingness

1205
01:17:14,473 --> 01:17:17,128
to sacrifice themselves
for the greater good.

1206
01:17:18,738 --> 01:17:22,655
Our concern is that Clay
believes that Derek Danforth

1207
01:17:23,134 --> 01:17:25,441
is the defective
offspring of a queen,

1208
01:17:26,093 --> 01:17:29,095
thereby Clay will strike
at the heart of the problem

1209
01:17:29,096 --> 01:17:31,316
and become a queen slayer.

1210
01:17:33,274 --> 01:17:36,539
<i>Adam Clay's next victim is
Derek Danforth's mother?</i>

1211
01:17:37,409 --> 01:17:39,542
President Danforth, sir.

1212
01:17:39,870 --> 01:17:42,872
<i>You have a blank
check. Good luck.</i>

1213
01:17:44,503 --> 01:17:45,678
Thank you.

1214
01:18:01,825 --> 01:18:03,608
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
This is a private event.

1215
01:18:03,609 --> 01:18:05,828
I'm gonna need you to
turn around, go away.

1216
01:18:05,829 --> 01:18:07,699
Federal Bureau of
something or another.

1217
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:09,353
We're good. We have
invites right here.

1218
01:18:09,354 --> 01:18:11,050
All right. You'll need
to excuse my partner.

1219
01:18:11,051 --> 01:18:12,740
He's recently concussed and
hasn't slept in two days.

1220
01:18:12,764 --> 01:18:13,997
We're on the access list.

1221
01:18:15,016 --> 01:18:16,317
We're good, boss.

1222
01:18:44,607 --> 01:18:46,521
Get the Secret Service
out of the house.

1223
01:18:46,522 --> 01:18:47,696
I don't want them here.

1224
01:18:47,697 --> 01:18:50,283
They're C team.
B team at best.

1225
01:18:50,308 --> 01:18:52,918
Uh, Mom's detail is
not going to like that.

1226
01:18:52,919 --> 01:18:55,660
Well, if Mom's detail
gets in the way

1227
01:18:55,661 --> 01:18:56,792
of what's coming for us,

1228
01:18:56,793 --> 01:18:58,786
they're dead men and so are we.

1229
01:19:00,013 --> 01:19:01,797
Tell them they can
stay in the kitchen.

1230
01:19:01,798 --> 01:19:02,798
Yes, sir.

1231
01:19:07,412 --> 01:19:09,587
He has a little
talent, doesn't he?

1232
01:19:09,588 --> 01:19:11,067
He's absolutely
fucking terrifying.

1233
01:19:11,068 --> 01:19:12,262
Yeah.

1234
01:19:12,287 --> 01:19:14,655
Good men, but clearly
not good enough.

1235
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,594
- Hm.
- Fuck, bruh!

1236
01:19:16,595 --> 01:19:18,596
How'd you piss
this oak off, huh?

1237
01:19:18,597 --> 01:19:19,825
I...

1238
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:21,730
- You're looking at me?
- Mm-hmm.

1239
01:19:21,731 --> 01:19:23,969
How is any of this my fault?

1240
01:19:23,994 --> 01:19:25,951
Wasn't your supersecret CIA

1241
01:19:25,952 --> 01:19:27,562
data mining software
supposed to,

1242
01:19:27,563 --> 01:19:28,824
I don't know, maybe filter out

1243
01:19:28,825 --> 01:19:30,317
un-fucking-stoppable
killing machines?

1244
01:19:30,342 --> 01:19:32,044
Don't you fuck
with me, young man!

1245
01:19:32,045 --> 01:19:33,829
Any other life,
you'd be in jail.

1246
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:36,354
Hey, this is the
fucking Beekeeper!

1247
01:19:39,966 --> 01:19:41,967
Yeah, you know I
killed one once.

1248
01:19:41,968 --> 01:19:43,273
Oh, you see?

1249
01:19:43,274 --> 01:19:45,492
Yeah. Only 'cause I was lucky.

1250
01:19:45,493 --> 01:19:48,105
- And un-fucking-lucky.
- Oh, jeez.

1251
01:19:50,934 --> 01:19:53,065
Yeah, don't piss
your pants, bruh.

1252
01:19:53,066 --> 01:19:54,869
My team will be out shortly.

1253
01:19:54,894 --> 01:19:56,242
If anyone can knock

1254
01:19:56,243 --> 01:19:58,070
this guy's dick in
the dirt, it's them.

1255
01:19:58,071 --> 01:20:00,895
Ain't that right, money man?

1256
01:20:02,833 --> 01:20:04,004
Yeah.

1257
01:20:19,789 --> 01:20:21,528
I'm supposed to be at
a kids' birthday party

1258
01:20:21,529 --> 01:20:22,786
with my wife.

1259
01:20:26,578 --> 01:20:28,448
You are at a kids'
birthday party.

1260
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:30,082
And I'm your work wife.

1261
01:20:44,857 --> 01:20:47,511
Madam President, you
look spectacular.

1262
01:20:47,512 --> 01:20:49,034
When the fuck are
you going to tell me

1263
01:20:49,035 --> 01:20:50,684
what's going on, Wallace?

1264
01:20:54,127 --> 01:20:55,607
Good. Go through.

1265
01:20:56,695 --> 01:20:58,783
Tell that guy to hurry up.

1266
01:20:58,784 --> 01:21:01,612
I want every manhole on
this street welded shut.

1267
01:21:10,535 --> 01:21:11,710
Six up.

1268
01:21:12,678 --> 01:21:13,723
Good to go.

1269
01:21:14,974 --> 01:21:16,280
Let's go. Let's go.

1270
01:21:28,379 --> 01:21:30,120
Come on. Move it up.

1271
01:21:47,006 --> 01:21:48,997
Put your head on a
swivel, gentlemen.

1272
01:22:05,289 --> 01:22:06,290
Go!

1273
01:22:33,966 --> 01:22:36,186
We got eyes on the second floor.

1274
01:22:43,628 --> 01:22:45,586
All right, you're
good. Coming through.

1275
01:23:09,349 --> 01:23:10,828
Oh.

1276
01:23:10,829 --> 01:23:14,223
Hey. When, uh, did you
get in? What a surprise.

1277
01:23:15,834 --> 01:23:18,314
You didn't hear the
giant Marine helicopter

1278
01:23:18,315 --> 01:23:20,335
land on the front lawn?

1279
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,318
Ah, I guess not. Hm.

1280
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:24,537
Is this, uh, nicotine
or a carnival ride?

1281
01:23:24,538 --> 01:23:27,149
Uh, I wouldn't
unless you want to go

1282
01:23:27,150 --> 01:23:28,754
talk with the machine elves.

1283
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,765
Hey, you look fucking
great, by the way.

1284
01:23:34,766 --> 01:23:38,043
I mean, power, it just
looks so good on you.

1285
01:23:38,074 --> 01:23:40,379
Doing blow on your
father's desk.

1286
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:42,164
God, how I wish
he was still alive

1287
01:23:42,165 --> 01:23:43,949
so I could kill him.

1288
01:23:46,169 --> 01:23:48,040
Stop picking your face.

1289
01:23:50,956 --> 01:23:53,740
Why does Wallace Westwyld
look nervous as a burning cat?

1290
01:23:53,741 --> 01:23:55,047
What have you done to the man?

1291
01:23:55,874 --> 01:23:58,067
Mm, I wouldn't know, Mother.

1292
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:00,225
Well, he's there to protect you

1293
01:24:00,226 --> 01:24:01,543
if you'll let him.

1294
01:24:04,481 --> 01:24:07,580
You're a good looking kid.
You really are. You know that?

1295
01:24:09,234 --> 01:24:10,379
What does that mean?

1296
01:24:12,195 --> 01:24:15,980
It means that God doesn't
give with both hands.

1297
01:24:15,981 --> 01:24:18,243
Uh, okay. I love you too, Mom.

1298
01:24:18,244 --> 01:24:19,854
Hm.

1299
01:24:19,855 --> 01:24:21,832
Gotta go run the free world.

1300
01:24:22,205 --> 01:24:23,614
Don't burn it down.

1301
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:31,909
Fucking fantastic!

1302
01:25:39,412 --> 01:25:40,932
Wiley, look.

1303
01:25:42,024 --> 01:25:43,809
Oh, shit.

1304
01:25:43,834 --> 01:25:45,855
Danforth looks like
she wants to throw up.

1305
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:48,421
Look at her body
language. Bad vibes.

1306
01:25:49,668 --> 01:25:51,163
She got caught riding dirty.

1307
01:25:52,599 --> 01:25:53,905
What have we done?

1308
01:25:54,598 --> 01:25:56,887
Are you, uh, fucking with
crypto at all, right now?

1309
01:25:56,912 --> 01:25:57,934
It's gonna pop.

1310
01:25:57,959 --> 01:26:00,714
They're minting next week,
so just hit me up on Insta.

1311
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:02,536
- Okay.
- I'll connect your wallet.

1312
01:26:02,561 --> 01:26:04,344
- May I borrow my son?
- Of course.

1313
01:26:04,369 --> 01:26:05,917
Speak to you a
moment in private?

1314
01:26:07,926 --> 01:26:09,051
Sorry.

1315
01:26:12,008 --> 01:26:13,356
Uh, who's this?

1316
01:26:13,381 --> 01:26:15,641
Jackson Prigg. He's
number two at the FBI.

1317
01:26:15,666 --> 01:26:17,014
Have a seat.

1318
01:26:17,015 --> 01:26:18,711
Uh, I'm cool. I'll stand.
What is this, like,

1319
01:26:18,712 --> 01:26:20,583
an ambush or something? This
feels weird. I don't like it.

1320
01:26:20,584 --> 01:26:21,889
No, you'll sit.

1321
01:26:25,075 --> 01:26:26,250
I'll sit.

1322
01:26:30,036 --> 01:26:31,376
Kelly, would you
give us a moment?

1323
01:26:31,377 --> 01:26:32,987
It's okay, ma'am.
I can take notes.

1324
01:26:32,988 --> 01:26:34,467
I need you to step outside.

1325
01:26:42,912 --> 01:26:45,914
The deputy director has
flagged his, uh, concerns

1326
01:26:45,939 --> 01:26:47,417
about some uncomfortable things

1327
01:26:47,442 --> 01:26:48,966
happening inside
the family company.

1328
01:26:49,632 --> 01:26:50,934
Like what?

1329
01:26:50,959 --> 01:26:52,395
Uncomfortable things about

1330
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:54,129
the source of my campaign funds.

1331
01:26:55,532 --> 01:26:57,360
Sounds serious. What's up?

1332
01:26:58,578 --> 01:26:59,817
Deputy Director.

1333
01:26:59,842 --> 01:27:04,317
Mr. Danforth, are you familiar
with, uh, United Data Group?

1334
01:27:05,597 --> 01:27:07,468
United Data Group.

1335
01:27:08,153 --> 01:27:11,294
Yeah. Yeah, I, uh...

1336
01:27:11,319 --> 01:27:13,365
I invested in that.

1337
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:14,767
I invest everywhere.

1338
01:27:14,768 --> 01:27:16,291
I mean, there's...
It's everywhere.

1339
01:27:16,292 --> 01:27:18,012
- It's very diverse.
- Uh-huh.

1340
01:27:18,037 --> 01:27:20,997
How about, uh, Nine Star United?

1341
01:27:23,965 --> 01:27:25,487
Yeah, that was, uh...

1342
01:27:25,512 --> 01:27:28,036
that's more of, like,
a consulting type role.

1343
01:27:28,061 --> 01:27:30,279
It's block chain issues.
And you probably...

1344
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:32,914
I don't want to bore
you with all that.

1345
01:27:33,855 --> 01:27:37,689
What do you know about
a classified algorithmic

1346
01:27:37,714 --> 01:27:39,193
data mining software package

1347
01:27:39,218 --> 01:27:41,809
developed by the
intelligence community?

1348
01:27:55,722 --> 01:27:57,028
He's here.

1349
01:27:57,867 --> 01:27:59,782
All stations, target's in
the building. East wing.

1350
01:27:59,806 --> 01:28:01,329
<i>Give me everything you got.</i>

1351
01:28:01,354 --> 01:28:02,442
He's in the house!

1352
01:28:03,016 --> 01:28:04,973
Assault team, saddle up!

1353
01:28:04,998 --> 01:28:06,477
Let's move, boys!
Get a move on!

1354
01:28:06,502 --> 01:28:07,689
Let's move! Come on!

1355
01:28:07,714 --> 01:28:10,072
- Go! Come on. Move!
- Go! Go!

1356
01:28:11,514 --> 01:28:13,498
Break-break! Package
is in the house!

1357
01:28:13,523 --> 01:28:15,350
Level three, side four.

1358
01:28:15,351 --> 01:28:18,136
Blue over blue, you see
him, you fucking get him!

1359
01:28:18,603 --> 01:28:21,306
Hey! Put your
fucking hands up.

1360
01:28:23,095 --> 01:28:24,939
Now turn the fuck around.

1361
01:28:29,495 --> 01:28:31,280
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

1362
01:28:34,152 --> 01:28:35,587
He's outside.
Target's outside.

1363
01:28:35,588 --> 01:28:37,111
Move! Move!

1364
01:28:37,112 --> 01:28:38,596
Let's get this fucking guy!

1365
01:28:38,621 --> 01:28:40,275
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Easy, killer. You see him?

1366
01:28:40,299 --> 01:28:41,471
Negative.

1367
01:28:42,613 --> 01:28:44,268
- Clay!
- That's right.

1368
01:28:46,209 --> 01:28:49,080
That's right. Now,
on your knees!

1369
01:28:49,105 --> 01:28:50,846
On your knees!

1370
01:28:52,028 --> 01:28:54,248
Lace your fingers
behind your head.

1371
01:28:56,368 --> 01:29:00,299
Down on your knees now!

1372
01:29:00,324 --> 01:29:01,630
Do it now!

1373
01:29:07,403 --> 01:29:10,754
Beekeeper, huh?
God's right hand?

1374
01:29:11,252 --> 01:29:12,383
You aren't shit.

1375
01:29:12,408 --> 01:29:13,582
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1376
01:29:13,583 --> 01:29:14,783
Hey, take a step back.

1377
01:29:15,352 --> 01:29:17,388
I'm putting this asshole's
brains on the lawn.

1378
01:29:17,413 --> 01:29:19,283
What are you doing?
He's not even armed.

1379
01:29:19,284 --> 01:29:20,666
Armed?

1380
01:29:20,691 --> 01:29:23,189
As long as this motherfucker's
breathing, he's armed.

1381
01:29:23,214 --> 01:29:25,766
You're not fucking
executing him.

1382
01:29:25,791 --> 01:29:27,489
Nice crowd you're rolling with.

1383
01:29:35,433 --> 01:29:36,608
Watch me.

1384
01:29:37,588 --> 01:29:39,043
V, what the fuck is going on?

1385
01:29:39,589 --> 01:29:42,288
To "bee" or not to "bee"?

1386
01:29:42,313 --> 01:29:44,402
Isn't that the bloody question?

1387
01:29:45,310 --> 01:29:46,529
I think I'll take

1388
01:29:47,482 --> 01:29:48,580
to "bee."

1389
01:29:59,018 --> 01:30:00,977
- Wiley?
- Yeah, you good?

1390
01:30:00,978 --> 01:30:02,022
- Yeah.
- Go.

1391
01:30:04,029 --> 01:30:05,726
Get off me!

1392
01:30:07,637 --> 01:30:09,116
He's fucking mine!

1393
01:30:10,030 --> 01:30:11,857
Talk to me, people.
I need news.

1394
01:30:21,085 --> 01:30:22,259
He's here!

1395
01:30:22,284 --> 01:30:24,112
Go! Go! All stations!

1396
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:29,179
Take it easy. Take it easy.

1397
01:30:33,711 --> 01:30:34,928
Go with the flow.

1398
01:30:34,968 --> 01:30:36,447
Not clear. He's not clear.

1399
01:30:36,448 --> 01:30:37,709
Hang tight.

1400
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:38,929
On me.

1401
01:30:58,666 --> 01:31:01,038
Get on the ground.
Get on the ground.

1402
01:31:03,823 --> 01:31:06,260
You understand you
did this, right?

1403
01:31:06,261 --> 01:31:07,369
You broke the rules.

1404
01:31:07,394 --> 01:31:09,705
You corrupted an imperfect
but functioning system.

1405
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:11,818
I was just trying to get
you into office, Mom.

1406
01:31:11,843 --> 01:31:13,089
How else do you think
you got elected?

1407
01:31:13,113 --> 01:31:15,353
I was going to win with
or without your help.

1408
01:31:15,389 --> 01:31:18,797
We were already rich. Your
father built an empire.

1409
01:31:18,822 --> 01:31:20,728
Yeah. And you were
going to fucking

1410
01:31:20,753 --> 01:31:22,624
break it up into
pieces and sell it off.

1411
01:31:22,625 --> 01:31:24,103
Well, in the name
of public service

1412
01:31:24,104 --> 01:31:26,758
because I care and I want
to leave a better world.

1413
01:31:26,759 --> 01:31:27,799
Okay. Right.

1414
01:31:27,824 --> 01:31:29,674
Yeah, because you hate the fact

1415
01:31:29,675 --> 01:31:30,713
that being the president

1416
01:31:30,738 --> 01:31:32,260
is just like an
endless cocktail party.

1417
01:31:32,339 --> 01:31:33,731
You realize that you were behind

1418
01:31:33,756 --> 01:31:35,743
in 15 of 20 counties
you needed to win.

1419
01:31:35,768 --> 01:31:37,421
15 of 20 counties!

1420
01:31:37,422 --> 01:31:40,307
I taught CIA software
to hunt money

1421
01:31:40,332 --> 01:31:41,594
and not terrorists.

1422
01:31:43,414 --> 01:31:44,719
You didn't hear that.

1423
01:31:58,005 --> 01:31:59,963
You got elected because
of me, and you know that.

1424
01:31:59,988 --> 01:32:02,676
Yeah, I know it.
Everyone knows it.

1425
01:32:02,701 --> 01:32:04,888
Now I know where the
money came from...

1426
01:32:04,913 --> 01:32:06,305
and all the people you hurt.

1427
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:09,016
Okay, whatever. It's
computer data, Mom.

1428
01:32:09,041 --> 01:32:10,402
Somebody in this family has
to have their fucking feet

1429
01:32:10,426 --> 01:32:12,826
on the ground to actually get
shit done. You understand that?

1430
01:32:28,519 --> 01:32:32,480
Mom, the wolves are at the
fucking door right now.

1431
01:32:32,505 --> 01:32:34,392
What are you going
to do to fix this?

1432
01:32:38,091 --> 01:32:39,283
Tell the truth.

1433
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:42,444
The fucking...

1434
01:32:42,469 --> 01:32:44,296
What does that even mean?

1435
01:32:44,321 --> 01:32:46,365
What does that even mean,
tell the fucking truth?

1436
01:32:46,390 --> 01:32:47,651
You have an entire building

1437
01:32:47,676 --> 01:32:48,869
full of PR people

1438
01:32:48,894 --> 01:32:50,440
that are going to choose
the right way forward.

1439
01:32:50,464 --> 01:32:52,857
That guy who's coming to
kill us, that Beekeeper,

1440
01:32:52,882 --> 01:32:55,753
I'm telling him the truth
about what you did, Derek.

1441
01:32:55,778 --> 01:32:57,475
Then I'm telling
the entire nation.

1442
01:32:57,500 --> 01:32:59,784
And if it costs me everything,

1443
01:32:59,809 --> 01:33:01,288
well, so be it.

1444
01:34:14,884 --> 01:34:16,189
You fucking git!

1445
01:34:22,413 --> 01:34:23,414
Fuck!

1446
01:34:28,463 --> 01:34:29,942
You're just a man.

1447
01:34:30,429 --> 01:34:31,777
I know.

1448
01:35:25,175 --> 01:35:26,252
Thank you.

1449
01:36:01,932 --> 01:36:04,602
Jesus. Looks like a
tornado came through here.

1450
01:36:10,346 --> 01:36:11,869
What's your plan here, huh?

1451
01:36:11,870 --> 01:36:13,245
You're going to tell this
guy the fucking truth

1452
01:36:13,269 --> 01:36:14,909
and hope that he spares
you and kills me instead?

1453
01:36:14,933 --> 01:36:16,195
No, Derek, I'll
tell him the truth

1454
01:36:16,219 --> 01:36:17,650
because it's the truth.

1455
01:36:27,669 --> 01:36:29,801
It's gone far enough.
You've proved your point.

1456
01:36:30,662 --> 01:36:33,057
Beekeepers live for
the good of society.

1457
01:36:34,627 --> 01:36:35,894
I'm retired.

1458
01:36:37,111 --> 01:36:38,462
This is personal.

1459
01:36:39,416 --> 01:36:40,986
All the more reason to stop.

1460
01:36:42,578 --> 01:36:44,841
Go back. Live a quiet life.

1461
01:36:45,472 --> 01:36:47,478
Making honey for your neighbors.

1462
01:36:47,705 --> 01:36:49,081
That's all I wanted.

1463
01:36:50,237 --> 01:36:53,065
- My neighbor's dead.
- I know. I'm sorry.

1464
01:36:53,129 --> 01:36:55,652
But do you live
in the real world

1465
01:36:55,653 --> 01:36:57,307
or just protect it?

1466
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:01,904
What does it matter to you

1467
01:37:01,929 --> 01:37:04,637
how presidents
come to be elected?

1468
01:37:04,662 --> 01:37:06,882
- Hm?
- It doesn't.

1469
01:37:07,244 --> 01:37:09,058
What does matter to you?

1470
01:37:09,697 --> 01:37:10,973
Right and wrong.

1471
01:37:11,877 --> 01:37:13,366
It's not fashionable.

1472
01:37:14,385 --> 01:37:16,194
I believe there's
good in the universe.

1473
01:37:16,195 --> 01:37:20,373
Yeah, well, we agree.
I mean, that's my view.

1474
01:37:21,542 --> 01:37:23,544
Until the Danforth
family bought you.

1475
01:37:24,127 --> 01:37:26,031
- Ah.
- You can stop pretending.

1476
01:37:26,911 --> 01:37:29,768
We wouldn't need Beekeepers
if it wasn't for men like you.

1477
01:37:30,254 --> 01:37:31,493
Don't do that.

1478
01:37:31,518 --> 01:37:33,025
Sir, you might
want to step back.

1479
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:34,119
No.

1480
01:37:34,144 --> 01:37:36,822
- I don't want you to get hurt.
- I'm sorry. I can't do that.

1481
01:37:38,544 --> 01:37:39,675
Now, have a seat.

1482
01:37:43,951 --> 01:37:47,214
Nah, fuck the truth,
man. The truth...

1483
01:37:47,239 --> 01:37:48,588
- Wait. You put that down.
- No, Derek.

1484
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:49,961
Comes out of your fucking...

1485
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:52,462
Jesus Christ!

1486
01:37:52,487 --> 01:37:53,767
That's fucking real right there.

1487
01:38:06,158 --> 01:38:08,482
- Clay, no!
- Drop your weapon. Drop it!

1488
01:38:25,189 --> 01:38:27,005
You decide who you work for.

1489
01:38:29,111 --> 01:38:30,443
For the law

1490
01:38:32,180 --> 01:38:33,660
or for justice.

1491
01:38:36,885 --> 01:38:37,973
Fuck this.

1492
01:38:38,408 --> 01:38:39,408
Bye, Mom.

1493
01:38:45,981 --> 01:38:47,588
- Go! Go!
- Move. Move.

1494
01:38:47,613 --> 01:38:49,611
- Move it out. Out of the way.
- You're okay.

1495
01:38:49,636 --> 01:38:52,683
- I got you. I got you.
- No. No. I want my...

1496
01:38:54,041 --> 01:38:55,207
Clay!

1497
01:38:58,689 --> 01:39:00,031
Come with us right now!

1498
01:39:00,865 --> 01:39:03,998
- No! I want my... I want my...
- Back away. Back away.

1499
01:39:03,999 --> 01:39:05,375
No!

1500
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:07,053
You need to come
with me. Come on.

1501
01:39:07,078 --> 01:39:08,775
- No!
- Move out. Move out.

1502
01:39:09,695 --> 01:39:11,914
- Give me your hand. Come on!
- No!

1503
01:39:24,899 --> 01:39:26,379
Goodbye, Adam Clay.

1504
01:39:27,401 --> 01:39:29,708
Keep eyes on! Let's go!
