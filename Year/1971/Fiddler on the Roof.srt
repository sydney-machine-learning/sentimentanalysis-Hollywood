1
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,671
A fiddler on the roof.
Sounds crazy, no?

2
00:02:22,801 --> 00:02:26,957
But here, in our
little village of Anatevka,

3
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:33,881
you might say every one of us
is a fiddler on the roof.

4
00:02:33,985 --> 00:02:40,510
Trying to scratch out
a pleasant, simple tune

5
00:02:40,614 --> 00:02:44,140
without breaking his neck.

6
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:46,392
It isn't easy.

7
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:53,528
You may ask why do we stay
up there if it's so dangerous?

8
00:02:53,633 --> 00:03:00,207
Well, we stay because
Anatevka is our home.

9
00:03:01,465 --> 00:03:04,495
And how do we keep our balance?

10
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:08,249
That I can tell you in one word:

11
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,805
Tradition.

12
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:15,213
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

13
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:17,185
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

14
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,299
<i>~ Tradition! ~</i>

15
00:03:19,403 --> 00:03:21,763
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

16
00:03:21,867 --> 00:03:23,734
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

17
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:26,695
<i>~ Tradition! ~</i>

18
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:42,616
Because of our traditions,

19
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,709
we've kept our balance
for many, many years.

20
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:58,551
Here in Anatevka,
we have traditions for everything.

21
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,098
How to sleep. How to eat.

22
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,362
How to work.

23
00:04:08,406 --> 00:04:11,526
How to wear clothes.

24
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:17,486
For instance,
we always keep our heads covered,

25
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,444
and always wear a little prayer shawl.

26
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:26,534
This shows our constant devotion to God.

27
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:32,294
You may ask,
how did this tradition get started?

28
00:04:32,398 --> 00:04:35,169
I'll tell you.

29
00:04:35,273 --> 00:04:37,336
I don't know.

30
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:39,966
But it's a tradition.

31
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:44,097
And because of our traditions,

32
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:47,971
every one of us knows who he is

33
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:51,654
and what God expects him to do.

34
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:58,445
<i>~ Who, day and night,</i>
<i>must scramble for a living ~</i>

35
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:01,237
<i>~ Feed a wife and children,</i>
<i>say his daily prayers ~</i>

36
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,326
<i>~ And who has the right</i>
<i>as master of the house ~</i>

37
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,662
<i>~ To have the final word at home ~</i>

38
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,038
<i>~ The papa ~</i>

39
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:12,876
<i>~ The papa ~</i>

40
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,002
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

41
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:16,170
<i>~ The papa ~</i>

42
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,963
<i>~ The papa ~</i>

43
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,183
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

44
00:05:23,565 --> 00:05:26,512
<i>~ Who must know the way</i>
<i>to make a proper home ~</i>

45
00:05:26,616 --> 00:05:29,640
<i>~ A quiet home, a kosher home ~</i>

46
00:05:29,744 --> 00:05:32,601
<i>~ Who must raise a family</i>
<i>and run the home ~</i>

47
00:05:32,705 --> 00:05:35,700
<i>~ So Papa's free to read the Holy Book ~</i>

48
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,236
<i>~ The mama ~</i>

49
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,206
<i>~ The mama ~</i>

50
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:44,956
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

51
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,281
<i>~ The mama ~</i>

52
00:05:47,386 --> 00:05:49,911
<i>~ The mama ~</i>

53
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:52,166
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

54
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:59,086
<i>~ At three I started Hebrew school ~</i>

55
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:02,009
<i>~ At ten I learned a trade ~</i>

56
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:05,178
<i>~ I hear they picked a bride for me ~</i>

57
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:08,181
<i>~ I hope she's pretty ~</i>

58
00:06:08,286 --> 00:06:14,149
<i>~ And who does Mama teach</i>
<i>to mend and tend and fix ~</i>

59
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:20,940
<i>~ Preparing her to marry</i>
<i>whoever Papa picks ~</i>

60
00:06:21,044 --> 00:06:23,109
<i>~ The daughters ~</i>

61
00:06:23,213 --> 00:06:25,082
<i>~ The daughters ~</i>

62
00:06:26,044 --> 00:06:27,050
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

63
00:06:27,155 --> 00:06:28,827
<i>~ The papas</i>
<i>Mamas ~</i>

64
00:06:28,931 --> 00:06:32,163
<i>~ Sons</i>
<i>The daughters ~</i>

65
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,132
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

66
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:45,427
And in the circle of our little village,
we've always had our special types.

67
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:50,433
For instance,
Yente, the matchmaker.

68
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:54,231
Reb Nachum, the beggar.

69
00:06:56,158 --> 00:07:01,313
And, most important of all,
our beloved rabbi.

70
00:07:01,417 --> 00:07:03,733
Rabbi, may I ask you a question?

71
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:05,530
Certainly, Leibesh.

72
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:08,866
Is there a proper blessing for the Tzar?

73
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,575
A blessing for the Tzar? Of course.

74
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:16,082
May God bless and keep the Tzar...

75
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:19,297
far away from us.

76
00:07:20,056 --> 00:07:21,421
<i>~ Dai dai dai dai ~</i>

77
00:07:21,526 --> 00:07:22,881
<i>~ Dai dai dai dai ~</i>

78
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:26,090
<i>~ Dai dai dai dai</i>
<i>Dai dai dai dai dai ~</i>

79
00:07:26,194 --> 00:07:27,636
<i>~ Dai dai dai dai ~</i>

80
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,263
<i>~ Dai dai dai dai ~</i>

81
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:32,275
<i>~ Dai dai dai dai</i>
<i>Dai dai dai dai dai ~</i>

82
00:07:56,802 --> 00:08:00,415
Then there are
the others in our village.

83
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:04,677
They make a much bigger circle.

84
00:08:07,813 --> 00:08:13,518
We don't bother them
and, so far, they don't bother us.

85
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:21,943
And among ourselves,
we always get along perfectly well.

86
00:08:23,078 --> 00:08:27,195
Of course, there was the time
when he sold him a horse

87
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:33,200
and told him it was only six years old
when it was really twelve.

88
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,910
But now it's all over.

89
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:41,215
And we all live
in simple peace and harmony.

90
00:08:44,266 --> 00:08:46,502
- It was really twelve years old.
- It was six.

91
00:08:46,607 --> 00:08:49,353
Tevye knows it was twelve.

92
00:08:55,443 --> 00:08:57,807
Twelve.

93
00:08:57,912 --> 00:09:01,024
It was twelve.

94
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,817
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

95
00:09:09,922 --> 00:09:11,790
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

96
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:13,573
<i>~ Tradition! ~</i>

97
00:09:13,677 --> 00:09:15,785
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

98
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,754
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

99
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,037
<i>~ Tradition! ~</i>

100
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:23,248
<i>~ Dai dai dai dai dai ~</i>

101
00:09:23,353 --> 00:09:25,220
<i>~ Dai dai dai dai ~</i>

102
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:29,046
Traditions, traditions.

103
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,464
Without our traditions,

104
00:09:31,568 --> 00:09:36,974
our lives would be as shaky as... as...

105
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:40,852
As a fiddler on the roof.

106
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:27,867
Mama, Yente the matchmaker is coming.

107
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:30,996
Maybe she's finally found
a good match for you, Tzeitel.

108
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,541
From your mouth to God's ears.

109
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,879
Why is she here now?
It's almost Sabbath.

110
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,506
Out, all of you.
I want to talk to Yente alone.

111
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,971
But, Mama, the men she finds...
The last one was so old.

112
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:47,150
And he was bald.
He had no hair.

113
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:50,894
A poor girl without a dowry
can't be so particular.

114
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:53,059
You want hair, marry a monkey.

115
00:13:53,163 --> 00:13:56,188
Even a poor girl
has to look at her husband sometimes.

116
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:58,945
A husband is not to look at,
a husband is to get.

117
00:13:59,049 --> 00:14:02,363
- I'm not yet 20 years old. I don't think...
- Sha!

118
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:05,118
Do you have to boast about your age?

119
00:14:05,222 --> 00:14:07,826
You wanna tempt the evil eye? Da, da, da.

120
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,750
Out, all of you. There's work
to be done before the Sabbath.

121
00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:21,336
Golde. Golde.

122
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,967
I have such news for you.

123
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:30,557
And not every-day-in-the-week news.
Once-in-a-lifetime news.

124
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,894
Such diamonds, such jewels.

125
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:37,520
I'll find a husband for every one of them.

126
00:14:37,624 --> 00:14:42,070
But you shouldn't be so picky.
Right? Of course, right.

127
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:48,907
After all, even the worst husband
is better than no husband. God forbid!

128
00:14:49,012 --> 00:14:51,075
Who should know better than me?

129
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:53,872
Ever since my husband died,
I've been a poor widow.

130
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,293
All alone, no one to talk to,
nothing to say to anyone.

131
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,875
All I do at night is think of him.

132
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:03,675
And even thinking of him
gives me no pleasure.

133
00:15:08,942 --> 00:15:12,056
- Is Tzeitel in the house?
- Why don't you go and find out?

134
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,230
Thank you, Bielke.

135
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:22,064
He never raised his voice.

136
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:25,155
Good afternoon.
Is Tzeitel in the house?

137
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:27,320
She's busy. Come back later.

138
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:29,617
There's something I'd like to tell her.

139
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,949
- Later.
- Later?

140
00:15:32,054 --> 00:15:33,922
Hm.

141
00:15:35,427 --> 00:15:38,207
What does that poor skinny tailor
want with Tzeitel?

142
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:41,418
They've been friends since
they were babies. They play...

143
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:46,089
- They play? What do they play?
- I don't know. They're children.

144
00:15:46,193 --> 00:15:48,929
From such children come other children.

145
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:51,094
Motel is nothing.

146
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,517
Yente, you said you had news for me.

147
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,516
Ah, children, children...

148
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,274
They are your blessing in your old age.

149
00:15:59,378 --> 00:16:03,568
But my Aaron, may he rest in peace,
couldn't give me children.

150
00:16:03,673 --> 00:16:07,071
To tell you the truth, he hardly tried.

151
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:11,451
But what's the use complaining?
Other women enjoy complaining.

152
00:16:11,556 --> 00:16:13,616
Not Yente.

153
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,290
Not every woman in the world is a Yente.

154
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:22,918
Well, I have to go home now
to prepare my poor Sabbath meal.

155
00:16:23,022 --> 00:16:25,131
So, goodbye, Golde.

156
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:29,050
And it was a pleasure
talking our hearts out to each other.

157
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,511
You said you had news for me.

158
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,806
I'm losing my head.

159
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,266
Some day it will fall off altogether.

160
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,480
And a horse will kick it in the mud
and "Goodbye, Yente".

161
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:43,197
Of course, the news.

162
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,831
It's about Lazar Wolf, the butcher.

163
00:16:46,935 --> 00:16:48,997
A good man. A fine man.

164
00:16:49,102 --> 00:16:53,297
And I don't have to tell you
he's well off, no?

165
00:16:53,402 --> 00:16:55,840
But he's lonely, the poor man.

166
00:16:55,944 --> 00:17:00,804
He's been a widower all these years.
You understand? Of course you do.

167
00:17:00,908 --> 00:17:08,021
To make it short, out of the whole town
he's cast his eye on Tzeitel.

168
00:17:08,125 --> 00:17:12,106
- My Tzeitel?
- No, the Tzar's Tzeitel.

169
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,689
Of course your Tzeitel.

170
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:18,703
Such a match for my Tzeitel.

171
00:17:19,752 --> 00:17:24,575
But Tevye wants a learned man.
He doesn't like Lazar.

172
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:29,623
Lazar won't marry him.
He wants the daughter, not the father.

173
00:17:29,728 --> 00:17:31,790
Listen to me, Golde.

174
00:17:31,894 --> 00:17:35,668
You send Tevye to him.
Don't tell him what it's about.

175
00:17:35,772 --> 00:17:38,005
Let Lazar discuss it himself.

176
00:17:38,109 --> 00:17:42,637
He'll win him over,
he's a good man and a wealthy man.

177
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:47,723
You'll let me know how it went.
And you don't have to thank me, Golde,

178
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:51,601
because, aside from my fee,
which Lazar will pay anyway,

179
00:17:51,705 --> 00:17:56,024
it gives me satisfaction
to make people happy.

180
00:17:56,128 --> 00:17:59,319
True? Of course, true.

181
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:03,573
So, goodbye, Golde,
and you're welcome.

182
00:18:03,677 --> 00:18:05,130
Goodbye, Yente.

183
00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:08,703
Come, children.

184
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:11,998
Get changed for the Sabbath.
Hurry with your work.

185
00:18:12,102 --> 00:18:14,582
I wonder if Yente found a husband for you.

186
00:18:14,686 --> 00:18:17,545
I'm not anxious for her to find me one.

187
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:20,635
- Unless it's Motel, the tailor.
- I didn't ask you.

188
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:25,302
Tzeitel, they have to make a match for you
before they can make one for me.

189
00:18:25,406 --> 00:18:27,803
- Then after her, one for me.
- So if Yente...

190
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:30,389
Yente, Yente, Yente!

191
00:18:30,494 --> 00:18:32,809
Somebody has to arrange the matches.

192
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:35,567
- She may bring someone wonderful.
- Interesting.

193
00:18:35,672 --> 00:18:38,532
- And well off.
- And important.

194
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:45,284

200
00:19:10,952 --> 00:19:17,900
<i>~ Bring me a ring for I'm longing</i>

201
00:19:18,005 --> 00:19:21,153

202
00:19:21,257 --> 00:19:24,656

205
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:38,333

206
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:41,340
<i>~ Night after night in the dark I'm alone ~</i>

207
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:48,482
<i>~ So find me a match of my own ~</i>

208
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:52,141
Since when are you
interested in a match, Chava?

209
00:19:52,245 --> 00:19:55,101
I thought you just had
your eye on your books.

210
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:57,646
And you have your eye
on the rabbi's son.

211
00:19:57,751 --> 00:19:59,275
Why not?

212
00:19:59,379 --> 00:20:04,109
We only have one rabbi
and he only has one son.

213
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:06,489
Why shouldn't I want the best?

214
00:20:06,593 --> 00:20:11,203
Because you're from a poor family,
so whatever Yente brings, you'll take.

215
00:20:11,307 --> 00:20:14,632
Right? Of course, right.

216
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:18,374
<i>~ Hodel, oh, Hodel,</i>
<i>have I made a match for you ~</i>

217
00:20:18,479 --> 00:20:21,586
<i>~ He's handsome, he's young -</i>
<i>all right, he's sixty-two ~</i>

218
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,964
<i>~ But he's a nice man, a good catch ~</i>

219
00:20:24,069 --> 00:20:25,299
<i>~ True? True ~</i>

220
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:28,553

221
00:20:28,658 --> 00:20:33,027

222
00:20:35,823 --> 00:20:38,937
<i>~ Chava, I found him,</i>

223
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:42,192
<i>~ He's handsome, he's tall -</i>
<i>that is, from side to side ~</i>

224
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:45,279
<i>~ But he's a nice man, a good catch, right? ~</i>

225
00:20:45,384 --> 00:20:46,344
<i>~ Right ~</i>

226
00:20:46,448 --> 00:20:49,488
<i>~ You heard he has a temper</i>
<i>He'll beat you every night ~</i>

227
00:20:49,592 --> 00:20:53,750
<i>~ But only when he's sober -</i>
<i>so you're all right ~</i>

228
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,786
<i>~ Did you think you'd get a prince ~</i>

229
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,803
<i>~ Well, I'll find the best I can ~</i>

230
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:04,335
<i>~ With no dowry, no money ~</i>

231
00:21:04,439 --> 00:21:06,921
<i>~ No family background ~</i>

232
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:11,434
<i>~ Be glad you've got a man ~</i>

233
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:22,228
<i>~ Matchmaker, matchmaker,</i>
<i>you know that I'm still very young ~</i>

234
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:24,730
<i>~ Please, take your time ~</i>

235
00:21:24,835 --> 00:21:28,693
<i>~ Up to this minute I misunderstood ~</i>

236
00:21:28,797 --> 00:21:32,572
<i>~ That I could get stuck for good ~</i>

237
00:21:32,676 --> 00:21:35,785
<i>~ Dear Yente, see that he's gentle ~</i>

238
00:21:35,889 --> 00:21:38,958
<i>~ Remember, you were also a bride ~</i>

239
00:21:39,062 --> 00:21:43,043
<i>~ It's not that I'm sentimental ~</i>

240
00:21:43,148 --> 00:21:47,258
<i>~ It's just that I'm terrified ~</i>

241
00:21:47,362 --> 00:21:50,345
<i>~ Matchmaker, matchmaker,</i>
<i>plan me no plans ~</i>

242
00:21:50,449 --> 00:21:53,680
<i>~ I'm in no rush,</i>
<i>maybe I've learned ~</i>

243
00:21:53,784 --> 00:21:58,393
<i>~ Playing with matches,</i>
<i>a girl can get burned ~</i>

244
00:21:58,497 --> 00:22:02,229
<i>~ So bring me no ring,</i>
<i>groom me no groom ~</i>

245
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:05,817
<i>~ Find me no find,</i>
<i>catch me no catch ~</i>

246
00:22:05,922 --> 00:22:11,334
<i>~ Unless he's a matchless match ~</i>

247
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,603
Dear God,

248
00:22:31,707 --> 00:22:34,703
was that necessary?

249
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:40,362
Did you have to make him lame
just before the Sabbath?

250
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:43,158
That wasn't nice.

251
00:22:43,262 --> 00:22:45,408
It's enough you pick on me.

252
00:22:45,512 --> 00:22:49,959
Bless me with five daughters,
a life of poverty, that's all right.

253
00:22:50,063 --> 00:22:52,675
But what have you got against my horse?

254
00:22:54,141 --> 00:23:00,218
Really, sometimes I think,
when things are too quiet up there,

255
00:23:00,322 --> 00:23:02,634
you say to yourself,

256
00:23:02,738 --> 00:23:08,237
"Let's see. What kind of mischief
can I play on my friend, Tevye?"

257
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,774
Uh-huh. So you're finally here,
my breadwinner.

258
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:18,858
I'll talk to you later.

259
00:23:18,963 --> 00:23:22,365
- Why are you late today?
- His foot went lame.

260
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:26,995
Hurry up. The sun won't wait.
I have something important to say to you.

261
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:29,160
I still have deliveries.

262
00:23:29,265 --> 00:23:32,334
- You'll be late for the Sabbath.
- I won't be late.

263
00:23:32,439 --> 00:23:37,668
- You'll be late.
- I won't be late. I won't be late.

264
00:23:37,772 --> 00:23:42,385
- If you ever stop talking, I won't be late.
- You can die from such a man.

265
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:48,807
As the Good Book says "Heal us,
O Lord, and we shall be healed."

266
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:52,018
In other words, send us the cure.

267
00:23:52,122 --> 00:23:54,737
We've got
the sickness already.

268
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:08,662
Well, I'm not really complaining.

269
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:11,877
After all, with your help...

270
00:24:13,554 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm starving to death.

271
00:24:17,104 --> 00:24:19,305
Oh, dear Lord.

272
00:24:23,647 --> 00:24:27,848
You made many, many poor people.

273
00:24:27,952 --> 00:24:32,311
I realise, of course,
it's no shame to be poor.

274
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:35,822
But it's no great honour either.

275
00:24:40,664 --> 00:24:44,155
So what would have been so terrible

276
00:24:44,259 --> 00:24:48,878
if I had a small fortune.

<i>~ A fine, tin roof</i>

00:29:30,571 --> 00:29:35,691
<i>~ Would it spoil some vast eternal plan ~</i>

334
00:29:37,114 --> 00:29:46,700
<i>~ If I were a wealthy man ~</i>

335
00:30:01,096 --> 00:30:03,960
Tevye, where's your horse?

336
00:30:04,064 --> 00:30:07,881
It decided to take the day off.

337
00:30:07,986 --> 00:30:12,973
- Have a good Sabbath.
- Thank you, Your Honour. Thank you.

338
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:21,991
- It's almost the Sabbath.
- You kept us all waiting.

339
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:27,493
Look at this.
Look what it says in the paper.

340
00:30:29,124 --> 00:30:30,989
Quiet!

341
00:30:31,093 --> 00:30:36,579
Will you stop braying like mules?
Let the man talk. Talk, Avram.

342
00:30:36,683 --> 00:30:40,958
My paper came to the post office today,
like it does every week.

343
00:30:41,062 --> 00:30:43,539
Usually on a Thursday, but sometimes...

344
00:30:43,643 --> 00:30:47,923
Avram, that's not talking.
That's babbling.

345
00:30:48,028 --> 00:30:50,504
The news, what does it say?

346
00:30:50,608 --> 00:30:52,425
Quiet!

347
00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:53,844
Talk, Avram.

348
00:30:53,948 --> 00:30:56,427
I was reading my paper.

349
00:30:56,531 --> 00:31:01,349
Nothing important, a story about
the crops in the Ukraine, and this and that.

350
00:31:01,454 --> 00:31:04,782
Avram, talk.

351
00:31:05,911 --> 00:31:09,529
And then I saw this.

352
00:31:10,749 --> 00:31:14,699
All right. We all see it.

353
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,797
What does it say?

354
00:31:21,177 --> 00:31:24,168
"In a village called Rajanka,

355
00:31:24,272 --> 00:31:29,258
all the Jews were evicted,
forced to leave their homes."

356
00:31:30,936 --> 00:31:33,634
For what reason?

357
00:31:33,738 --> 00:31:38,386
It doesn't say. Maybe the Tzar
wanted their land. Maybe a plague.

358
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:42,098
- May he have his own personal plague.
Amen!

359
00:31:42,203 --> 00:31:45,727
Why don't you ever bring us
some good news?

360
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:49,067
It's not my fault. I only read it.

361
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:51,527
"An edict from the authorities."

362
00:31:51,631 --> 00:31:55,658
May the authorities grow like onions,
with their heads in the ground.

363
00:31:55,762 --> 00:31:57,029
Amen!

364
00:31:57,133 --> 00:32:00,786
What good will your cursing do?

365
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:05,841
You stand around, you curse and
you chatter, and you don't do anything.

366
00:32:06,722 --> 00:32:10,252
- You'll all chatter your way into the grave.
- Excuse me.

367
00:32:10,356 --> 00:32:13,464
- You're not from this village.
- No.

368
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:18,271
- Where are you from?
- Kiev. I was a student in the university.

369
00:32:21,028 --> 00:32:25,729
Tell me, is that the place where you
learned how not to respect your elders?

370
00:32:25,833 --> 00:32:29,232
That is where I learned
there is more to life than talk.

371
00:32:29,336 --> 00:32:33,362
You should know what's
going on in the outside world.

372
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:36,116
Why break my head
about the outside world?

373
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,539
Let the outside world
break its own head. Well put.

374
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:44,664
He is right.
As the Good Book says,

375
00:32:44,768 --> 00:32:48,833
"If you spit in the air,
it lands in your face."

376
00:32:48,937 --> 00:32:50,834
Nonsense.

377
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:56,171
You can't close your eyes
to what's happening in the world.

378
00:32:56,276 --> 00:32:59,347
- He is right.
- He's right and he's right?

379
00:32:59,451 --> 00:33:01,897
They can't both be right.

380
00:33:02,862 --> 00:33:04,931
You are also right.

381
00:33:05,036 --> 00:33:07,894
He's too young to wipe his own nose.

382
00:33:07,998 --> 00:33:10,946
Good Sabbath, Tevye.

383
00:33:12,955 --> 00:33:16,945
- Here. Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath, Tevye.

384
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:21,788
- Tevye, Tevye?
- I'm sorry. I apologise.

385
00:33:22,882 --> 00:33:24,746
Good Sabbath.

386
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:28,175
- Tevye, the rabbi's order.
- Of course.

387
00:33:29,430 --> 00:33:31,583
So you're from Kiev, Reb?

388
00:33:31,687 --> 00:33:34,296
- Perchik.
- Perchik.

389
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,088
So you're a newcomer here, huh?

390
00:33:38,193 --> 00:33:43,971
As Abraham said,
"I'm a stranger in a strange land."

391
00:33:44,076 --> 00:33:46,139
Moses said that.

392
00:33:46,243 --> 00:33:47,892
Forgive me.

393
00:33:47,996 --> 00:33:52,562
As King David said,
"I'm slow of speech and slow of tongue."

394
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:55,781
That was also Moses.

395
00:33:56,957 --> 00:34:00,872
For a man with a slow tongue,
he talked a lot.

396
00:34:02,796 --> 00:34:04,866
Here, Reb Perchik.

397
00:34:04,971 --> 00:34:07,163
Have a piece.

398
00:34:07,268 --> 00:34:09,873
I have no money, and I'm not a beggar.

399
00:34:09,978 --> 00:34:14,015
Take it.
It's a blessing for me to give.

400
00:34:15,893 --> 00:34:18,379
Very well.
For your sake.

401
00:34:18,483 --> 00:34:20,934
Thank you.

402
00:34:21,982 --> 00:34:24,430
It's no crime to be poor.

403
00:34:24,534 --> 00:34:28,434
It is the rich who are the criminals.
Some day, their wealth will be ours.

404
00:34:28,538 --> 00:34:33,814
That would be nice.
If they would agree, I would agree.

405
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,819
And who will make
this miracle to come to pass?

406
00:34:36,923 --> 00:34:38,945
Ordinary people.

407
00:34:39,049 --> 00:34:42,033
- Like you?
- Like me.

408
00:34:42,137 --> 00:34:46,700
Until your golden day comes,
Reb Perchik, how will you live?

409
00:34:46,804 --> 00:34:49,956
By giving lessons to children.
Do you have children?

410
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,128
I have five daughters.

411
00:34:53,013 --> 00:34:54,712
Five?

412
00:34:54,816 --> 00:34:56,710
Daughters.

413
00:34:56,814 --> 00:34:59,717
Girls should learn, too.
Girls are people.

414
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:01,382
- A radical.
- Go away.

415
00:35:01,486 --> 00:35:05,970
I'd be willing to teach them,
open their minds to great thoughts.

416
00:35:06,074 --> 00:35:08,183
I'd like them to know the Good Book.

417
00:35:08,287 --> 00:35:11,519
The Bible has many lessons
for our times.

418
00:35:11,624 --> 00:35:14,101
Perchik,

419
00:35:14,205 --> 00:35:16,732
I'm a very poor man.

420
00:35:16,836 --> 00:35:20,902
But, food for lessons, huh?

421
00:35:21,006 --> 00:35:23,447
Good. Stay with us for the Sabbath.

422
00:35:23,551 --> 00:35:27,578
Of course, we don't eat like kings,
but we don't starve either.

423
00:35:27,682 --> 00:35:29,076
As the Good Book says,

424
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:33,414
"When a poor man eats a chicken,
one of them is sick."

425
00:35:33,518 --> 00:35:36,587
- Where does the Book say that?
- All right, all right.

426
00:35:36,691 --> 00:35:42,049
It doesn't exactly say that,
but some place, it mentions a chicken.

427
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:44,601
- Good Sabbath.
- Good Sabbath.

428
00:35:48,277 --> 00:35:50,763
Good Sabbath, children.

429
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:53,143
Children, this is Perchik.

430
00:35:53,248 --> 00:35:56,770
- Perchik, this is my eldest daughter.
- Good Sabbath.

431
00:35:56,874 --> 00:36:01,237
- You have a pleasant daughter.
- I have <i>five</i> pleasant daughters.

432
00:36:01,341 --> 00:36:04,611
This is mine.
And this is mine.

433
00:36:04,715 --> 00:36:07,112
And this is mine.

434
00:36:07,217 --> 00:36:09,077
And this is mine.

435
00:36:09,181 --> 00:36:10,660
And this is mine.

436
00:36:10,764 --> 00:36:12,622
And...

437
00:36:12,726 --> 00:36:17,125
Well, this is not mine.
Perchik, this is Motel Kamzoil.

438
00:36:17,229 --> 00:36:20,177
So, you did us a favour and came home.

439
00:36:22,186 --> 00:36:24,300
This is also mine.

440
00:36:24,405 --> 00:36:30,889
Golde, this is Perchik from Kiev.
He's staying the Sabbath with us.

441
00:36:30,994 --> 00:36:33,894
He's a teacher.
Would you like lessons from him?

442
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:36,309
- Yes, Papa.
- I'm a very good teacher.

443
00:36:36,414 --> 00:36:41,154
I heard that the rabbi who must praise
himself has a congregation of one.

444
00:36:42,748 --> 00:36:45,279
Your daughter has
a quick and witty tongue.

445
00:36:45,383 --> 00:36:47,696
The wit she gets from me.

446
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,574
- As the Good Book says...
- The Good Book can wait. Get washed.

447
00:36:51,678 --> 00:36:56,246
- The tongue she gets from her mother.
- Motel, you're also eating with us?

448
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:59,337
Of course. Another blessing.

449
00:36:59,441 --> 00:37:02,922
Tzeitel, get the small table.
Chava, the chairs from outside.

450
00:37:03,027 --> 00:37:06,759
Children, finish dressing.
You can wash at the well.

451
00:37:06,863 --> 00:37:09,691
Hurry, it's almost the Sabbath.

452
00:37:11,193 --> 00:37:13,067
Tevye.

453
00:37:13,946 --> 00:37:16,099
Tevye, I've something to say to you.

454
00:37:16,203 --> 00:37:18,896
Why should today be different?

455
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,229
I have something to tell you.

456
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:24,442
- I have something to tell you.
- Yente was here.

457
00:37:24,546 --> 00:37:25,694
I saw her.

458
00:37:25,798 --> 00:37:29,404
If they agree on a match,
it will be too late for us.

459
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:33,871
But I have found someone who will
sell me his used sewing machine.

460
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:36,580
In a few weeks, I'll be able to buy it.

461
00:37:36,684 --> 00:37:39,124
- Then your father...
- It might be too late.

462
00:37:39,229 --> 00:37:42,751
- Lazar Wolf wants to see you.
- The butcher? What about?

463
00:37:42,855 --> 00:37:45,297
I don't know.
Only he says it's important.

464
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:48,757
What can be important?
I have nothing for him to slaughter.

465
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:51,303
After the Sabbath, talk with him.

466
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:53,182
About what?

467
00:37:53,286 --> 00:37:58,227
If he's thinking about buying
my new milk cow, he can forget it.

468
00:37:58,331 --> 00:38:00,281
- Tevye, I want you to talk.
- Shh.

469
00:38:05,372 --> 00:38:08,539
Tevye. Tevye, I want you to talk to...

470
00:38:13,297 --> 00:38:16,168
What else can I do?

471
00:38:17,218 --> 00:38:20,580
You could ask my father
for my hand tonight. Now.

472
00:38:20,685 --> 00:38:23,793
Why should he consider me now?
I'm only a poor tailor.

473
00:38:23,897 --> 00:38:26,799
And I'm only the daughter
of a poor milkman.

474
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:31,770
- Just talk to him.
- If your father says no, that's it.

475
00:38:32,858 --> 00:38:35,056
- He'll yell at me.
- Motel...

476
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,060
- I'm just a poor tailor.
- Motel!

477
00:38:38,165 --> 00:38:41,571
Even a poor tailor
is entitled to some happiness.

478
00:38:44,537 --> 00:38:45,912
That's true.

479
00:38:47,665 --> 00:38:49,402
- Amen.
- Amen.

480
00:38:49,506 --> 00:38:53,823
A man sends you an important a message,
at least you can talk to him.

481
00:38:53,927 --> 00:38:57,328
All right, after the Sabbath I'll talk to him.

482
00:38:57,433 --> 00:39:00,959
All right, I'll talk to him.

483
00:39:08,978 --> 00:39:12,008
It's getting late.

484
00:39:12,112 --> 00:39:15,263
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, Papa.

485
00:39:15,367 --> 00:39:18,972
Children, come down.
We are lighting the candles.

486
00:39:19,076 --> 00:39:23,144
- Reb Tevye...
- Not now, Motel. Hurry up, children.

487
00:39:23,248 --> 00:39:24,896
- Reb Tevye.
- Not now.

488
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,940
Golde, the sun is almost down.

489
00:39:28,045 --> 00:39:30,985
- Reb Tevye...
- What is it?

490
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:32,570
- Reb Tevye...
- Yes?

491
00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:36,076
- Reb Tevye...
- Yes? Yes? Yes?

492
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,841
Well, Motel, what is it?

493
00:39:41,051 --> 00:39:43,537
Good Sabbath, Reb Tevye.

494
00:39:43,641 --> 00:39:46,128
Good Sabbath. Good Sabbath.

495
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:49,382
Hurry up.

496
00:39:49,486 --> 00:39:52,892
Hurry, children, hurry. It's getting late.

497
00:40:31,185 --> 00:40:37,262
<i>~ May the Lord protect and defend you ~</i>

498
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:42,814
<i>~ May he always shield you from shame ~</i>

499
00:40:43,948 --> 00:40:53,699
<i>~ May you come to be</i>
<i>in Israel a shining name ~</i>

500
00:40:56,752 --> 00:41:01,959
<i>~ May you be like Ruth and like Esther ~</i>

<i>~ May you be deserving of praise ~</i>

502
00:41:09,265 --> 00:41:19,064

503
00:41:22,278 --> 00:41:28,893

513
00:42:20,049 --> 00:42:24,955
<i>~ Amen ~</i>

514
00:42:39,021 --> 00:42:41,097
Is Reb?

515
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:46,145
Is Reb Lazar Wolf at home?

516
00:42:49,823 --> 00:42:52,393
Is Reb Lazar Wolf at home?

517
00:42:52,497 --> 00:42:55,484
- He's in the back.
- Oh.

518
00:42:55,589 --> 00:42:58,782
May I... Hm?

519
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:03,245
- Come in.
- Thank you. Thank you.

520
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:19,213
And all this from killing
innocent animals?

521
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:22,431
- Don't touch anything.
- All right.

522
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,296
Well, Tevye.

523
00:43:56,223 --> 00:43:59,170
You're here. Sit down. Sit down.

524
00:43:59,274 --> 00:44:01,050
Thank you.

525
00:44:01,154 --> 00:44:06,352
- Have a drink.
- I won't insult you by saying no.

526
00:44:09,236 --> 00:44:11,722
How goes it with you, Reb Tevye?

527
00:44:11,826 --> 00:44:14,602
- How should it go?
- You're right.

528
00:44:14,706 --> 00:44:17,231
- And you?
- The same.

529
00:44:17,335 --> 00:44:20,661
I'm sorry to hear that.

530
00:44:28,797 --> 00:44:30,457
Uh...

531
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:32,870
Uh...

532
00:44:32,975 --> 00:44:37,253
How is your brother-in-law in America?

533
00:44:37,357 --> 00:44:39,795
- He's doing very well.
- He wrote you?

534
00:44:39,899 --> 00:44:42,423
- Not lately.
- How do you know?

535
00:44:42,527 --> 00:44:46,683
If he was doing badly, he would write.

536
00:44:49,026 --> 00:44:51,102
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

537
00:44:53,489 --> 00:44:56,194
- Lechaim.
- Lechaim.

538
00:44:59,954 --> 00:45:02,824
- Tevye.
- Yeah?

539
00:45:03,249 --> 00:45:08,872
I suppose you know
why I wanted to see you.

540
00:45:09,213 --> 00:45:12,121
Yes, I do, but...

541
00:45:12,225 --> 00:45:14,837
There is no use talking about it.

542
00:45:18,305 --> 00:45:21,713
Tevye, I understand how you feel,

543
00:45:21,817 --> 00:45:27,841
but after all you have
a few more without her.

544
00:45:27,945 --> 00:45:32,973
I see. Today you want one.
Tomorrow you may want two.

545
00:45:33,077 --> 00:45:36,810
Two? What would I do with two?

546
00:45:36,915 --> 00:45:40,027
The same as you do with one.

547
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,108
Tevye.

548
00:45:52,954 --> 00:45:56,067
This is very important to me.

549
00:45:56,171 --> 00:45:59,285
Why is it so important to you?

550
00:46:00,628 --> 00:46:04,412
Frankly, because...

551
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:08,541
I'm lonely.

552
00:46:11,097 --> 00:46:12,917
Lonely?

553
00:46:13,022 --> 00:46:16,755
Reb Lazar,
what are you talking about?

554
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,172
How can a little cow keep you company?

555
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,009
Little cow?

556
00:46:21,113 --> 00:46:24,220
- Is that what you call her?
- But that's what she is.

557
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:26,599
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you know?

558
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:31,851
Of course, I know. We are talking about
the milk cow you want to buy from me.

559
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,358
A milk cow.

560
00:46:37,582 --> 00:46:39,954
A milk cow so I won't be lonely?

561
00:46:46,132 --> 00:46:48,701
I'm talking about...

562
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:52,375
your daughter Tzeitel.

563
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,041
My daughter Tzeitel?

564
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,588
Of course, your daughter Tzeitel.

565
00:46:57,692 --> 00:47:01,719
I see her every Thursday
in my butcher's shop.

566
00:47:01,823 --> 00:47:05,509
And she's made
a very good impression on me.

567
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,763
A very good impression.

568
00:47:07,867 --> 00:47:09,810
Reb Tevye,

569
00:47:09,914 --> 00:47:12,064
I like her.

570
00:47:14,285 --> 00:47:19,492
Why don't we just shake hands
and call it a match, huh?

571
00:47:22,627 --> 00:47:24,613
And...

572
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:28,247
I will be good to her.

573
00:47:28,966 --> 00:47:30,840
Tevye.

574
00:47:33,554 --> 00:47:35,428
I...

575
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:39,142
I like her.

576
00:47:41,354 --> 00:47:43,430
Well?

577
00:47:44,941 --> 00:47:47,221
What do you think?

578
00:47:47,325 --> 00:47:49,809
- What do I think?
- Huh?

579
00:47:56,369 --> 00:48:00,192
I never really liked him.

580
00:48:00,297 --> 00:48:04,280
Why should I? You can have
a fine conversation with him

581
00:48:04,384 --> 00:48:07,739
if you talk about kidneys and livers.

582
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:10,913
On the other hand,

583
00:48:11,018 --> 00:48:15,081
not everyone has to be a scholar.

584
00:48:15,185 --> 00:48:20,802
And with a butcher, my daughter
will surely never know hunger.

585
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:24,219
Maybe I misjudged him.

586
00:48:26,232 --> 00:48:28,937
He's a good man.

587
00:48:30,194 --> 00:48:32,483
He likes her.

588
00:48:34,907 --> 00:48:38,572
And he'll try to make her happy.

589
00:48:42,081 --> 00:48:43,990
What do I think?

590
00:48:45,084 --> 00:48:47,825
It's a match.

591
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:50,791
- You agree?
- I agree.

592
00:48:51,799 --> 00:48:55,123
Tevye, you've made me a happy man.

593
00:48:55,227 --> 00:48:58,339
- Let's drink on it.
- Why not?

594
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,296
- To you.
- No, my friend. To you.

595
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,466
- To the both of us.
- To our agreement.

596
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:09,351
To our prosperity.

597
00:49:10,776 --> 00:49:15,393
To our good health and happiness.

598
00:49:15,498 --> 00:49:17,696
And most important of all...

599
00:49:20,453 --> 00:49:21,901
Well...

600
00:49:22,005 --> 00:49:25,442
<i>~ To life, to life, lechaim ~</i>

601
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:28,698

602
00:49:28,803 --> 00:49:31,408

603

604
00:49:33,513 --> 00:49:34,745

<i>~ Lechaim, lechaim, to life ~</i>

607
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:44,169
<i>~ Life has a way of confusing us ~</i>

608
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:46,338
<i>~ Blessing and bruising us ~</i>

609
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:49,142
<i>~ Drink, lechaim, to life ~</i>

610
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:52,637
<i>~ God would like us to be joyful ~</i>

611
00:49:52,741 --> 00:49:57,352
<i>~ Even when our hearts</i>
<i>lie panting on the floor ~</i>

612
00:49:57,456 --> 00:50:00,107
<i>~ How much more can we be joyful ~</i>

613
00:50:00,211 --> 00:50:04,818
<i>~ When there's really something</i>
<i>to be joyful for ~</i>

614
00:50:04,922 --> 00:50:07,452
<i>~ To life, to life, lechaim ~</i>

615
00:50:08,417 --> 00:50:11,614
<i>~ To Tzeitel my daughter</i>
<i>My wife ~</i>

616
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:14,160
<i>~ It gives you something to think about ~</i>

617
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:16,204
<i>~ Something to drink about ~</i>

618
00:50:16,309 --> 00:50:21,711
<i>~ Drink, lechaim, to life ~</i>

619
00:50:21,815 --> 00:50:24,547
- Mordcha!
- Yes? What is it?

620
00:50:24,651 --> 00:50:27,089
- Drinks for everyone.
- What's the big occasion?

621
00:50:27,193 --> 00:50:29,506
I'm taking myself a bride.

622
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:33,354
- Who's the lucky one?
- Tevye's eldest, Tzeitel.

623
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,729
<i>~ To Lazar Wolf ~</i>

624
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:41,477
<i>~ To Tevye ~</i>

625
00:50:41,582 --> 00:50:44,355
<i>~ To Tzeitel your daughter</i>
<i>My wife ~</i>

626
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,316

<i>~ Lechaim, lechaim, to life ~</i>

630
00:50:56,014 --> 00:51:00,163

634

635
00:51:12,863 --> 00:51:16,348

636

Hey!

Hey!

659
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,911

Mazel tov. Mazel tov.

666
00:56:11,351 --> 00:56:13,882
Tevye?

667
00:56:15,389 --> 00:56:20,718
Tevye, after the marriage,

668
00:56:20,822 --> 00:56:24,136
- we will be related.
- Yeah?

669
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,525
You will be my papa.

670
00:56:30,029 --> 00:56:32,105
Your papa.

671
00:56:36,702 --> 00:56:38,900
Lazar Wolf,

672
00:56:39,005 --> 00:56:42,661
I always wanted a son.

673
00:56:44,085 --> 00:56:48,830
But I wanted one
a little younger than myself.

674
00:56:59,558 --> 00:57:01,931
Good night.

675
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:15,808
I hear that congratulations
are in order, Tevye.

676
00:57:15,912 --> 00:57:19,443
Thank you, Your Honour. Thank you.

677
00:57:20,454 --> 00:57:22,328
Tevye.

678
00:57:23,165 --> 00:57:25,039
Tevye.

679
00:57:29,463 --> 00:57:31,586
Yes, Your Honour?

680
00:57:32,758 --> 00:57:36,083
I have some news
I think I should tell you as a friend.

681
00:57:36,187 --> 00:57:37,543
Yes, Your Honour?

682
00:57:37,648 --> 00:57:41,500
I'm giving you this news
because I like you.

683
00:57:41,605 --> 00:57:45,100
You're an honest, decent person,
even though you are a Jew.

684
00:57:47,607 --> 00:57:50,009
Thank you, Your Honour.

685
00:57:50,113 --> 00:57:54,854
How often does a man
get a compliment like that?

686
00:57:55,448 --> 00:57:57,934
And the news?

687
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:05,278
Sometime soon this district is to have
a little unofficial demonstration.

688
00:58:06,829 --> 00:58:08,905
What?

689
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:13,597
A pogrom here?

690
00:58:13,975 --> 00:58:17,995
No, just a little unofficial demonstration.

691
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:19,955
Little?

692
00:58:20,059 --> 00:58:21,954
How little?

693
00:58:22,058 --> 00:58:24,206
Just some mischief.

694
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:29,128
So, if an inspector comes through,
he can see we did our duty.

695
00:58:29,232 --> 00:58:33,217
I don't know why there has to be
this trouble between people.

696
00:58:33,321 --> 00:58:37,138
But I thought I should tell you.

697
00:58:37,242 --> 00:58:40,022
Thank you, Your Honour.

698
00:58:41,072 --> 00:58:43,610
You are a good man.

699
00:58:44,742 --> 00:58:47,106
If I may say so...

700
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:51,193
It's too bad you're not a Jew.

701
00:58:51,298 --> 00:58:56,036
That's what I like about you.
You're always joking.

702
00:59:00,633 --> 00:59:03,541
Congratulations again for your daughter.

703
00:59:03,645 --> 00:59:06,416
Thank you, Your Honour.

704
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,548
Oh, about the other matter.
It won't be too bad. I wouldn't worry.

705
00:59:10,652 --> 00:59:12,434
Of course not.

706
00:59:30,496 --> 00:59:32,816
Dear God,

707
00:59:32,921 --> 00:59:39,962
did you have to send me news
like that today of all days?

708
00:59:41,299 --> 00:59:46,666
I know we are the chosen people.

709
00:59:46,770 --> 00:59:52,184
But once in a while,
can't you choose someone else?

710
00:59:57,982 --> 01:00:00,384
Anyway,

711
01:00:00,489 --> 01:00:06,737
thank you for sending
a husband for my Tzeitel.

712
01:00:10,161 --> 01:00:12,237
Lechaim.

713
01:01:12,790 --> 01:01:17,407
Now, after Jacob had
worked for Laban for seven years,

714
01:01:17,512 --> 01:01:19,701
do you know what happened?

715
01:01:19,806 --> 01:01:24,204
Laban fooled him
and gave him his ugly daughter Leah.

716
01:01:24,308 --> 01:01:29,291
So to marry Rachel, Jacob was forced
to work another seven years.

717
01:01:29,395 --> 01:01:35,476
So, you see, the Bible clearly teaches us
you can never trust an employer.

718
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:38,383
And that is what the Bible teaches us?

719
01:01:38,487 --> 01:01:43,350
That is the lesson of the story of Jacob
if you interpret it correctly.

720
01:01:43,454 --> 01:01:46,400
- Is your papa up yet?
- No, Mama.

721
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:51,063
Enough lessons. Back to the house.
There's work to be done.

722
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:54,697
Go on, children.
Another story tomorrow.

723
01:01:59,879 --> 01:02:03,082
That was a very
interesting lesson, Perchik.

724
01:02:04,342 --> 01:02:07,083
- Do you think so?
- Mmm.

725
01:02:07,187 --> 01:02:12,711
Although I don't know if the rabbi
would agree with your interpretation.

726
01:02:12,815 --> 01:02:16,465
Neither, I suppose, would the rabbi's son.

727
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:19,342
My little sisters talk too much.

728
01:02:19,447 --> 01:02:22,931
And what do you know about him,
except that he is the rabbi's son?

729
01:02:23,036 --> 01:02:28,605
At least I know he has no strange ideas
about turning the world upside down.

730
01:02:28,709 --> 01:02:30,520
Good day, Perchik.

731
01:02:30,624 --> 01:02:36,151
You have wit, even some intelligence.
Perhaps, but what good is your brain?

732
01:02:36,255 --> 01:02:39,240
Without curiosity, it is a rusty tool.

733
01:02:39,345 --> 01:02:40,950
Good day, Hodel.

734
01:02:41,055 --> 01:02:45,535
We have an old custom here.
A boy talks respectfully to a girl.

735
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:49,706
But that is too traditional
for an advanced thinker like you.

736
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:53,750
Our traditions. Nothing must change.
Everything is perfect as it is.

737
01:02:53,854 --> 01:02:57,840
- We like our ways.
- Our ways are changing all over but here.

738
01:02:57,944 --> 01:03:03,358
In the city boys and girls are affectionate
without the permission of a matchmaker.

739
01:03:04,402 --> 01:03:07,726
They hold hands together.
They even dance together.

740
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:10,360
New dances like this.

741
01:03:15,997 --> 01:03:18,784
I learned it in Kiev.

742
01:03:22,253 --> 01:03:25,254
- Do you like it?
- It's very nice.

743
01:03:43,024 --> 01:03:45,344
There.

744
01:03:45,448 --> 01:03:48,557
We've just changed an old custom.

745
01:03:48,661 --> 01:03:50,315
Yes.

746
01:03:52,283 --> 01:03:55,403
I mean, thank you.

747
01:03:58,498 --> 01:04:02,661
I mean, good day.

748
01:04:05,338 --> 01:04:07,414
Go away.

749
01:04:26,067 --> 01:04:27,727
Oh!

750
01:04:35,118 --> 01:04:39,235
So, my prince is finally out of bed.

751
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:42,821
Open your eyes.
The day's half gone.

752
01:04:42,925 --> 01:04:44,865
Well?

753
01:04:44,969 --> 01:04:48,823
Well, what happened last night,
besides you drinking like a peasant?

754
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:51,953
Did you see Lazar Wolf?

755
01:04:52,058 --> 01:04:54,793
Well? Well?

756
01:04:54,897 --> 01:04:56,919
What did he say?

757
01:04:57,023 --> 01:04:59,684
What did you say?

758
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,885
- Where's Tzeitel?
- She's in the barn.

759
01:05:03,989 --> 01:05:07,970
Do you have news for me?
Did you talk with Lazar Wolf?

760
01:05:08,075 --> 01:05:11,732
- What happened?
- Patience, woman, patience.

761
01:05:13,406 --> 01:05:16,980
As the Good Book says,
"Good news will stay,

762
01:05:17,085 --> 01:05:19,940
and bad news will refuse to leave."

763
01:05:20,044 --> 01:05:23,656
- And another saying goes...
- You can die from such a man.

764
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:29,285
Did you see Lazar? How was it?

765
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:31,994
Are you still drunk or what?

766
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:34,244
Ah, here she is.

767
01:05:34,349 --> 01:05:37,168
Tzeitel, my lamb. Come here.

768
01:05:37,273 --> 01:05:41,125
You are to be congratulated.

769
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:45,171
- You are going to be married.
Married!

770
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:48,179
What do you mean, Papa?

771
01:05:48,284 --> 01:05:51,221
Lazar Wolf has asked for your hand.

772
01:05:51,325 --> 01:05:54,016
- I knew it.
- The butcher?

773
01:05:54,121 --> 01:05:56,644
Dear God, I thank thee.

774
01:05:56,748 --> 01:05:58,727
Why do you have to?

775
01:05:58,832 --> 01:06:02,151
- What do you have to say, Tzeitel?
- What can she say?

776
01:06:02,255 --> 01:06:06,375
- Let her say one word.
- My first-born a bride.

777
01:06:09,462 --> 01:06:13,785
May you grow old with him
in fortune and honour.

778
01:06:13,889 --> 01:06:16,581
Not like Fruma Sarah, his first wife.

779
01:06:16,685 --> 01:06:19,502
She was a bitter woman,
may she rest in peace.

780
01:06:19,607 --> 01:06:23,459
Not like my Tzeitel.

781
01:06:23,564 --> 01:06:25,923
And now I must thank Yente.

782
01:06:26,028 --> 01:06:30,138
My Tzeitel a bride. A bride!

783
01:06:30,242 --> 01:06:33,557
I thank thee. I thank thee. Oh, a bride!

784
01:06:33,661 --> 01:06:36,274
Well, Chava?

785
01:06:37,323 --> 01:06:39,232
Mazel tov, Tzeitel.

786
01:06:40,243 --> 01:06:42,313
"Mazel tov, Tzeitel."

787
01:06:42,417 --> 01:06:44,897
What kind of a mazel tov is that?

788
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:50,326
And you, Reb Perchik,
aren't you going to congratulate her?

789
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:54,115
Congratulations, Tzeitel,
for getting a rich man.

790
01:06:54,219 --> 01:06:55,869
Ah.

791
01:06:55,973 --> 01:06:59,829
Again with the rich.
What's wrong with being rich?

792
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:03,594
It's no reason to marry.
Money's the world's curse.

793
01:07:04,892 --> 01:07:08,671
May the Lord smite me with it.

794
01:07:08,775 --> 01:07:12,134
And may I never recover.

795
01:07:12,238 --> 01:07:14,107
World's curse.

796
01:07:16,279 --> 01:07:21,479
My Tzeitel knows I mean only
her welfare. Am I right, Tzeitel?

797
01:07:21,583 --> 01:07:24,522
- Yes, Papa.
- There, you see?

798
01:07:24,627 --> 01:07:27,740
I see.
I see very well.

799
01:07:38,134 --> 01:07:40,371
Well, my child?

800
01:07:40,475 --> 01:07:43,333
Why are you so silent?

801
01:07:43,437 --> 01:07:49,008
Aren't you happy with this blessing, huh?

802
01:07:49,113 --> 01:07:51,845
Papa... Papa...

803
01:07:51,949 --> 01:07:54,644
What is it? Tell me.

804
01:07:55,276 --> 01:08:00,560
Papa, I don't want to marry him.
I can't marry him. I can't.

805
01:08:00,664 --> 01:08:03,020
What do you mean, you can't?

806
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:07,690
If I say you will, you will.

807
01:08:07,794 --> 01:08:11,779
If it's a matter of money,
I'll do anything.

808
01:08:11,883 --> 01:08:14,362
I'll hire myself out as a servant...

809
01:08:14,466 --> 01:08:17,409
But we made an agreement.

810
01:08:17,513 --> 01:08:20,840
And with us,
an agreement is an agreement.

811
01:08:22,595 --> 01:08:28,468
Is that more important than I am, Papa?

812
01:08:33,106 --> 01:08:35,803
Papa, don't force me, please!

813
01:08:35,907 --> 01:08:39,980
I'll be unhappy all my days.

814
01:08:43,366 --> 01:08:47,909
- I don't want to marry him.
- All right. All right.

815
01:08:48,955 --> 01:08:51,244
I won't force you.

816
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:55,126
Oh, thank you, Papa. Thank you.

817
01:08:55,878 --> 01:08:58,416
"Thank you, Papa."

818
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:07,966
It seems it was not ordained that
you should have all the comforts of life.

819
01:09:17,066 --> 01:09:20,346
- Reb Tevye, may I speak to you?
- Later, Motel.

820
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:27,242
- But I would like to speak to you.
- Not now. I have problems.

821
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:31,484
That's what I want to speak
to you about. I think I can help.

822
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:35,737
Like a bandage can help a corpse.
Goodbye, Motel.

823
01:09:35,841 --> 01:09:39,032
At least listen to him, Papa.

824
01:09:39,136 --> 01:09:42,870
All right, you have a tongue. Talk.

825
01:09:42,974 --> 01:09:45,708
I hear you are arranging
a match for Tzeitel.

826
01:09:45,813 --> 01:09:47,879
Ah, he also has ears.

827
01:09:48,348 --> 01:09:50,668
Well...

828
01:09:50,772 --> 01:09:54,007
- I have a match for Tzeitel.
- What kind of a match?

829
01:09:54,112 --> 01:09:56,423
A perfect fit.

830
01:09:56,528 --> 01:09:58,925
Like a glove.

831
01:09:59,029 --> 01:10:01,389
This match was made
exactly to measure.

832
01:10:01,493 --> 01:10:03,555
Perfect fit? Made to measure?

833
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:06,895
Stop talking like a tailor
and tell me, who is it?

834
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:12,911
- Please don't shout at me.
- All right. All right, I won't shout.

835
01:10:13,957 --> 01:10:16,110
Who is it?

836
01:10:16,214 --> 01:10:17,946
Who is it?

837
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:20,907
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

838
01:10:21,011 --> 01:10:22,797
Who is it?!

839
01:10:25,593 --> 01:10:27,669
It's me.

840
01:10:28,846 --> 01:10:30,839
Myself.

841
01:10:33,393 --> 01:10:35,469
It's him.

842
01:10:36,104 --> 01:10:37,635
Himself.

843
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:42,386
Either you're out of your mind
or you're crazy. He must be crazy.

844
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:46,098
Arranging a match for yourself?
What are you? Everything?

845
01:10:46,202 --> 01:10:49,394
Bridegroom, matchmaker,
and guests rolled into one?

846
01:10:49,498 --> 01:10:52,190
I suppose you'll perform
the ceremony, too?

847
01:10:52,294 --> 01:10:54,356
Please don't shout at me.

848
01:10:54,461 --> 01:10:57,613
As for being my matchmaker,
I know it's unusual.

849
01:10:57,717 --> 01:10:59,695
Unusual? It's crazy.

850
01:10:59,799 --> 01:11:01,864
Times are changing.

851
01:11:01,968 --> 01:11:08,084
Over a year ago, Tzeitel and I gave each
other our pledge that we would marry.

852
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:16,434
You gave each other a pledge?

853
01:11:23,569 --> 01:11:25,645
Yes, Papa.

854
01:11:26,614 --> 01:11:29,698
We gave each other our pledge.

855
01:11:31,452 --> 01:11:34,232
They gave each other a pledge?

856
01:11:34,336 --> 01:11:36,694
Unheard of. Absurd.

857
01:11:36,798 --> 01:11:40,456
<i>~ You gave each other</i>
<i>a pledge - unthinkable ~</i>

858
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:45,535
<i>~ Where do you think you are,</i>
<i>in Moscow, in Paris? ~</i>

859
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:48,749
<i>~ Where do they think they are, America? ~</i>

860
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:53,413
<i>~ What do you think you're doing,</i>
<i>you're a stitcher, you're nothing ~</i>

861
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:56,959
<i>~ Who do you think you are,</i>
<i>King Solomon? ~</i>

862
01:11:57,063 --> 01:12:00,920
<i>~ This isn't the way it's done,</i>
<i>not here, not now ~</i>

863
01:12:01,024 --> 01:12:07,473
<i>~ Some things I will not,</i>
<i>I cannot allow ~</i>

864
01:12:09,111 --> 01:12:11,187
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

865
01:12:11,656 --> 01:12:15,690
<i>~ Marriages must be arranged</i>
<i>by the papa ~</i>

866
01:12:15,794 --> 01:12:17,816
<i>~ This should never be changed ~</i>

867
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:22,151
<i>~ One little time, you pull out a prop and</i>
<i>where does it stop? Where does it stop? ~</i>

868
01:12:22,256 --> 01:12:24,319
Where does it stop?

869
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:27,948
Do I still have something
to say about my daughter?

870
01:12:28,052 --> 01:12:31,077
Doesn't anyone have to ask
a father any more?

871
01:12:31,181 --> 01:12:36,669
I've wanted to ask you for a while, but first
I wanted to get my own sewing machine.

872
01:12:36,773 --> 01:12:39,166
Stop talking nonsense.

873
01:12:39,271 --> 01:12:41,420
You are just a poor tailor.

874
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:45,516
That's true, but even a poor tailor
is entitled to some happiness.

875
01:12:57,410 --> 01:13:02,237
I promise you, Reb Tevye,
your daughter will not starve.

876
01:13:05,334 --> 01:13:10,411
Ah. He's beginning to talk like a man.

877
01:13:12,008 --> 01:13:14,039
On the other hand,

878
01:13:14,143 --> 01:13:19,212
what kind of a match
would that be with a poor tailor?

879
01:13:21,550 --> 01:13:27,665
On the other hand,
he is an honest, hard worker.

880
01:13:27,769 --> 01:13:33,925
But on the other hand,
he has absolutely nothing.

881
01:13:34,029 --> 01:13:40,273
On the other hand, things could never
get worse for him, only better.

882
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:46,936
They gave each other a pledge.

883
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:49,692
Unheard of. Absurd.

884
01:13:49,797 --> 01:13:53,654
<i>~ They gave each other</i>
<i>a pledge - unthinkable ~</i>

885
01:13:54,916 --> 01:14:01,077
<i>~ But look at my daughter's face,</i>
<i>she loves him, she wants him ~</i>

886
01:14:01,181 --> 01:14:04,036
<i>~ And look at my daughter's eyes ~</i>

887
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:07,337
<i>~ So hopeful ~</i>

888
01:14:10,307 --> 01:14:12,383
Tradition!

889
01:14:22,302 --> 01:14:24,378
Well, children...

890
01:14:25,806 --> 01:14:29,340
When shall we make the wedding?

891
01:14:30,936 --> 01:14:33,012
Thank you, Papa.

892
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:38,223
Reb Tevye, you won't be sorry.
You won't be sorry.

893
01:14:38,328 --> 01:14:40,388
I won't be sorry?

894
01:14:40,492 --> 01:14:42,518
I'm sorry already.

895
01:14:42,622 --> 01:14:44,441
Thank you, Papa.

896
01:14:44,616 --> 01:14:48,151
- Thank you, Papa.
- All right, all right.

897
01:14:50,038 --> 01:14:51,912
Papa.

898
01:14:58,964 --> 01:15:02,249
They gave each other a pledge.

899
01:15:10,017 --> 01:15:12,093
Golde.

900
01:15:14,563 --> 01:15:16,472
What shall I tell Golde?

901
01:15:23,405 --> 01:15:27,901
- Motel, you were wonderful.
- It was a miracle.

902
01:15:28,535 --> 01:15:31,527
<i>~ Wonder of wonders,</i>
<i>miracle of miracles ~</i>

903
01:15:31,631 --> 01:15:34,485
<i>~ God took a Daniel once again ~</i>

904
01:15:34,589 --> 01:15:37,658
<i>~ Stood by his side</i>
<i>and miracle of miracles ~</i>

905
01:15:37,762 --> 01:15:40,532
<i>~ Walked him through the lion's den ~</i>

906
01:15:40,637 --> 01:15:43,993
<i>~ Wonder of wonders,</i>
<i>miracle of miracles ~</i>

907
01:15:44,098 --> 01:15:46,872
<i>~ I was afraid that God would frown ~</i>

908
01:15:46,976 --> 01:15:53,139
<i>~ But like he did so long ago in Jericho,</i>
<i>God just made a wall fall down ~</i>

909
01:15:56,438 --> 01:16:02,637
<i>~ When Moses softened Pharaoh's heart,</i>
<i>that was a miracle ~</i>

910
01:16:02,741 --> 01:16:08,851
<i>~ When God made the waters of</i>
<i>the Red Sea part, that was a miracle, too ~</i>

911
01:16:08,956 --> 01:16:15,482
<i>~ But of all God's miracles large</i>
<i>and small, the most miraculous one of all ~</i>

912
01:16:15,586 --> 01:16:26,582
<i>~ Is that out of a worthless lump of clay</i>
<i>God has made a man today ~</i>

913
01:16:26,686 --> 01:16:30,001
<i>~ Wonder of wonders,</i>
<i>miracle of miracles ~</i>

914
01:16:30,105 --> 01:16:33,043
<i>~ God took a tailor by the hand ~</i>

915
01:16:33,148 --> 01:16:36,255
<i>~ Turned him around</i>
<i>and miracle of miracles ~</i>

916
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:39,133
<i>~ Led him to the Promised Land ~</i>

917
01:16:39,237 --> 01:16:45,679
<i>~ When David slew Goliath,</i>
<i>yes, that was a miracle ~</i>

918
01:16:45,783 --> 01:16:54,064
<i>~ When God gave us manna</i>
<i>in the wilderness, that was a miracle, too ~</i>

919
01:16:54,169 --> 01:17:02,288
<i>~ But of all God's miracles large</i>
<i>and small, the most miraculous one of all ~</i>

920
01:17:03,505 --> 01:17:09,378
<i>~ Is the one I thought could never be ~</i>

921
01:17:10,053 --> 01:17:18,595
<i>~ God has given you to me ~</i>

922
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:51,413
- Good day.
- Hello, Sarah.

923
01:17:51,518 --> 01:17:55,124
Mazel tov, Chava.
Soon it will be you.

924
01:17:55,229 --> 01:17:58,131
- I hope so.
- Give my best wishes to Tzeitel.

925
01:17:58,236 --> 01:18:01,144
- Mazel tov! Mazel tov!
- Goodbye.

926
01:18:04,232 --> 01:18:09,726
- Mazel tov, Chava.
- Mazel tov, Chava.

927
01:18:09,831 --> 01:18:11,897
Don't run away...

928
01:18:16,036 --> 01:18:21,108
No, don't.
Please, I just want... to get by.

929
01:18:21,212 --> 01:18:23,406
All right, stop it.

930
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:26,071
- What's wrong with you, Fyedka?
- Stop it.

931
01:18:26,175 --> 01:18:31,243
- We're just having a little fun, Fyedka.
- Goodbye, Sasha.

932
01:18:31,347 --> 01:18:33,501
I said goodbye.

933
01:18:51,571 --> 01:18:54,102
I'm sorry about that.
They mean no harm.

934
01:18:54,206 --> 01:18:56,275
Don't they?

935
01:19:09,798 --> 01:19:11,784
Is there something you want?

936
01:19:11,889 --> 01:19:14,830
Yes, I'd like to talk to you.

937
01:19:14,934 --> 01:19:17,597
I'd rather not.

938
01:19:18,765 --> 01:19:21,334
I've often noticed you at the bookseller's.

939
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:24,925
Not many girls in this village like to read.

940
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:28,845
Would you like to borrow this book?

941
01:19:28,949 --> 01:19:31,647
It's very good.

942
01:19:34,322 --> 01:19:36,030
No.

943
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:41,235
- Thank you.
- Why?

944
01:19:41,339 --> 01:19:44,200
Because I'm not Jewish?

945
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:49,740
Do you feel about me
the way they feel about you?

946
01:19:49,844 --> 01:19:52,673
I didn't think you would.

947
01:19:53,800 --> 01:19:57,413
And what do you know about me, eh?

948
01:19:57,517 --> 01:20:00,292
Let me tell you about myself.

949
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:02,543
I'm a pleasant fellow.

950
01:20:02,648 --> 01:20:05,550
Charming, honest,

951
01:20:05,655 --> 01:20:09,175
ambitious, quite bright,

952
01:20:09,279 --> 01:20:12,524
and very modest.

953
01:20:20,410 --> 01:20:23,447
Go ahead. Take the book.

954
01:20:24,247 --> 01:20:27,655
And after you return it,
I'll ask you how you like it.

955
01:20:27,759 --> 01:20:30,365
And we can talk about it for a while.

956
01:20:30,469 --> 01:20:35,420
Then we can talk about life.
How we feel about things.

957
01:20:36,718 --> 01:20:38,047
Here.

958
01:20:48,522 --> 01:20:50,763
Thank you.

959
01:20:53,652 --> 01:20:56,432
- Good day, Chava.
- Good day.

960
01:20:56,536 --> 01:20:58,606
Fyedka.

961
01:21:03,912 --> 01:21:05,988
Fyedka.

962
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:51,986
- Help! Help!
- Tell me, what's the matter with you?

963
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:56,119
Wake up. What is
the matter with you? Wake up!

964
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:59,206
- Where is she?
- Who?

965
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:02,292
- What are you talking about?
- Fruma Sarah.

966
01:22:02,397 --> 01:22:06,000
Lazar Wolfs first wife
was standing here a minute ago.

967
01:22:06,104 --> 01:22:10,550
What are you talking about?
Fruma Sarah has been dead for years.

968
01:22:10,655 --> 01:22:17,388
Sha! You must have been dreaming.
Sha. Sha.

969
01:22:17,492 --> 01:22:23,312
Now, tell me what you dreamt
and I'll tell you what it meant.

970
01:22:23,416 --> 01:22:25,894
Ooh, it was terrible.

971
01:22:25,998 --> 01:22:28,396
- Tell me.
- All right.

972
01:22:28,501 --> 01:22:32,197
Only don't be frightened!

973
01:22:34,586 --> 01:22:40,579
In the beginning, I dreamt that...

974
01:22:40,684 --> 01:22:47,129
we were having
a celebration of some kind.

975
01:22:49,184 --> 01:22:57,096
Everybody we knew,
all of our beloved departed were there.

976
01:22:58,985 --> 01:23:01,349
All of them.

977
01:23:01,453 --> 01:23:06,813
Even your Great Uncle
Mordechai was there.

978
01:23:06,917 --> 01:23:10,983
And your cousin Rachel was there.

979
01:23:11,087 --> 01:23:13,361
And in the middle of the dream,

980
01:23:13,465 --> 01:23:17,659
in walks your grandmother Tzeitel,
may she rest in peace.

981
01:23:17,764 --> 01:23:20,829
Grandmother Tzeitel?
How did she look?

982
01:23:20,933 --> 01:23:25,580
For a woman who is dead 30 years,
she looked very good.

983
01:23:25,684 --> 01:23:28,625
Naturally, I went up to greet her.

984
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:32,714
<i>~ A blessing on your head</i>
<i>Mazel tov, mazel tov ~</i>

985

988
01:23:42,536 --> 01:23:43,767

<i>~ A worthy boy is he</i>

991
01:23:50,710 --> 01:23:54,361
<i>~ They named him after my</i>

992
01:23:54,465 --> 01:23:56,489
<i>~ The tailor Motel Kamzoil ~</i>

993
01:23:56,593 --> 01:23:57,988
Tailor?

994
01:23:58,092 --> 01:24:01,865
- She heard wrong. It's the butcher.
- I'll tell her.

995
01:24:01,969 --> 01:24:04,828
<i>~ You must have heard wrong, Grandma ~</i>

996
01:24:04,933 --> 01:24:07,624
<i>~ There's no tailor ~</i>

997
01:24:07,728 --> 01:24:08,792
Huh?

998
01:24:08,896 --> 01:24:12,002
<i>~ You mean the butcher, Grandma ~</i>

999
01:24:12,106 --> 01:24:13,754
<i>~ By the name of Lazar Wolf ~</i>

1000
01:24:13,858 --> 01:24:18,424
<i>~ No, no, no</i>
<i>I mean the tailor, Tevye ~</i>

1001
01:24:18,528 --> 01:24:21,303
<i>~ My great grandchild ~</i>

1002
01:24:21,407 --> 01:24:24,931
<i>~ My little Tzeitel, who you named for me ~</i>

1003
01:24:25,035 --> 01:24:28,853

1004
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:32,147
<i>~ For such a match I prayed</i>

1005

1006
01:24:36,006 --> 01:24:39,407
<i>~ A fine, upstanding boy,</i>

1007
01:24:39,511 --> 01:24:40,989
<i>~ The tailor Motel Kamzoil ~</i>

1008
01:24:41,094 --> 01:24:44,534
But let me explain to you. Stop!

1009
01:24:44,638 --> 01:24:47,830
We announced it already.
We made a bargain with the butcher.

1010
01:24:47,934 --> 01:24:51,003
<i>~ A blessing on your house</i>
<i>Mazel tov, mazel tov ~</i>

1011
01:24:51,107 --> 01:24:54,089

<i>Mazel tov, mazel tov ~</i>

1012
01:24:54,193 --> 01:24:57,425
<i>~ And such a son-in-law</i>
<i>like no one ever saw ~</i>

1013
01:24:57,529 --> 01:25:00,883
- Stop them.
Listen to me. But he is a butcher.

1014
01:25:00,988 --> 01:25:03,680
Tell them.
- His name is Lazar Wolf.

1015
01:25:03,784 --> 01:25:06,944
<i>~ The tailor Motel Kam...</i>
<i>Sha! Sha! ~</i>

1016
01:25:08,448 --> 01:25:10,396
<i>~ Look</i>
<i>Who is this? ~</i>

1017
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:13,659
<i>~ Who comes here?</i>
<i>Who? Who? Who? Who? Who? ~</i>

1018
01:25:15,497 --> 01:25:18,904
<i>~ What woman is this,</i>
<i>by righteous anger shaken ~</i>

1019
01:25:19,009 --> 01:25:20,782
<i>~ Could it be</i>
<i>Yes, it could ~</i>

1020
01:25:20,887 --> 01:25:23,997
<i>~ Why not?</i>
<i>Who could be mistaken? ~</i>

1021
01:25:26,091 --> 01:25:28,843
<i>~ It's the butcher's wife</i>
<i>come from beyond the grave ~</i>

1022
01:25:30,470 --> 01:25:34,710
<i>~ It's the butcher's dear, darling,</i>
<i>departed wife Fruma Sarah ~</i>

1023
01:25:34,814 --> 01:25:36,599
<i>~ Fruma Sarah</i>
<i>Fruma Sarah ~</i>

1024
01:25:41,982 --> 01:25:44,218
Tevye!

1025
01:25:44,323 --> 01:25:47,309
<i>~ What is this about your daughter</i>
<i>marrying my husband? ~</i>

1026
01:25:47,413 --> 01:25:48,597
<i>~ Yes, her husband ~</i>

1027
01:25:48,701 --> 01:25:51,356
<i>~ Would you do this to your friend</i>
<i>and neighbour Fruma Sarah? ~</i>

1028
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:52,492
<i>~ Fruma Sarah ~</i>

1029
01:25:52,597 --> 01:25:55,400
<i>~ Have you no consideration</i>
<i>for a woman's feelings? ~</i>

1030
01:25:55,505 --> 01:25:56,605
<i>~ Woman's feelings ~</i>

1031
01:25:56,709 --> 01:25:59,485
<i>~ Handing over my belongings</i>
<i>to a total stranger ~</i>

1032
01:25:59,589 --> 01:26:00,623
<i>~ Total stranger ~</i>

1033
01:26:00,728 --> 01:26:04,238
<i>~ How can you allow it? How can</i>
<i>you let your daughter take my place? ~</i>

1034
01:26:04,343 --> 01:26:08,871
<i>~ Live in my house, carry my keys</i>
<i>and wear my clothes, pearls, how? ~</i>

1035
01:26:08,975 --> 01:26:11,136
<i>~ How can you allow your daughter</i>
<i>to take her place? ~</i>

1036
01:26:11,261 --> 01:26:12,298
<i>~ Pearls?</i>
<i>House? ~</i>

1037
01:26:12,403 --> 01:26:13,388
<i>~ Pearls?</i>
<i>Keys? ~</i>

1038
01:26:13,492 --> 01:26:14,400
<i>~ Pearls?</i>
<i>Clothes? ~</i>

1039
01:26:14,504 --> 01:26:15,963
<i>~ Pearls?</i>
<i>How? ~</i>

1040
01:26:16,067 --> 01:26:19,177
Tevye!

1041
01:26:23,815 --> 01:26:25,974
<i>~ Such a learned man as Tevye</i>
<i>wouldn't let it happen ~</i>

1042
01:26:26,078 --> 01:26:27,305
<i>~ Let it happen ~</i>

1043
01:26:27,409 --> 01:26:30,349
<i>~ Tell me that it isn't true</i>
<i>and then I wouldn't worry ~</i>

1044
01:26:30,453 --> 01:26:31,446
<i>~ Wouldn't worry ~</i>

1045
01:26:31,550 --> 01:26:34,269
<i>~ Say you didn't give your blessing</i>
<i>to your daughter's marriage ~</i>

1046
01:26:34,374 --> 01:26:35,644
<i>~ Daughter's marriage ~</i>

1047
01:26:35,748 --> 01:26:38,485
<i>~ Let me tell you what would follow</i>
<i>such a fatal wedding ~</i>

1048
01:26:38,589 --> 01:26:39,825
<i>~ Fatal wedding ~</i>

1049
01:26:42,083 --> 01:26:44,160
Shh! Shh!

1050
01:26:46,254 --> 01:26:48,662
Sha!

1051
01:26:49,216 --> 01:26:54,748
<i>~ If Tzeitel marries Lazar Wolf ~</i>

1052
01:26:54,853 --> 01:26:58,503
<i>~ I pity them both ~</i>

1053
01:26:58,607 --> 01:27:03,217
<i>~ She'll live with him three weeks ~</i>

1054
01:27:03,321 --> 01:27:06,516
<i>~ And when three weeks are up ~</i>

1055
01:27:07,484 --> 01:27:10,236
<i>~ I'll come to her by night ~</i>

1056
01:27:11,238 --> 01:27:15,100
<i>~ I'll take her by the throat ~</i>

1057
01:27:15,204 --> 01:27:20,076
<i>~ And this I'll give your Tzeitel,</i>
<i>that I'll give your Tzeitel ~</i>

1058
01:27:32,509 --> 01:27:34,585
Jump!

1059
01:27:36,763 --> 01:27:45,177
Here's my wedding present
if she marries Lazar Wolf!

1060
01:27:45,281 --> 01:27:48,385
Evil spirit, away.

1061
01:27:48,489 --> 01:27:50,431
Such an evil spirit.

1062
01:27:50,535 --> 01:27:53,973
May it sink back into the earth.

1063
01:27:54,077 --> 01:27:57,934
Such a dark and horrible dream.

1064
01:27:58,039 --> 01:28:02,191
And to think it was brought on
because you went to see that butcher.

1065
01:28:02,295 --> 01:28:03,737
Tevye...

1066
01:28:03,841 --> 01:28:08,200
If my grandmother Tzeitel,
may she rest in peace,

1067
01:28:08,304 --> 01:28:13,162
took the trouble to come from
the other world to tell us about the tailor,

1068
01:28:13,266 --> 01:28:17,248
all I can say is that it's for the best
and couldn't possibly be any better.

1069
01:28:17,353 --> 01:28:19,248
- But, Golde...
- Amen.

1070
01:28:19,353 --> 01:28:21,423
Amen.

1071
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:31,684
Cu-cu-cooo!

1072
01:29:31,570 --> 01:29:35,604
Do you like these troublemakers?
These Christ-killers?

1073
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:37,897
Of course not.

1074
01:29:38,001 --> 01:29:42,287
I just meant that things
have been peaceful here.

1075
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:47,365
I have other villages to visit.

1076
01:29:47,469 --> 01:29:52,328
If you don't want to follow orders,
we shall get someone else who will.

1077
01:29:52,432 --> 01:29:56,208
Oh, no, no, no, no, sir.
I'll take care of it. Of course.

1078
01:31:51,918 --> 01:31:54,782
Quiet down. Quiet down.

1079
01:31:54,886 --> 01:31:58,083
Quiet down.

1080
01:32:39,758 --> 01:32:46,462
<i>~ Is this the little girl I carried? ~</i>

1081
01:32:46,566 --> 01:32:52,966
<i>~ Is this the little boy at play? ~</i>

1082
01:32:53,070 --> 01:33:00,017
<i>~ I don't remember growing older ~</i>

1083
01:33:00,121 --> 01:33:05,402
<i>~ When did they? ~</i>

1084
01:33:06,076 --> 01:33:12,524
<i>~ When did she</i>
<i>get to be a beauty? ~</i>

1085
01:33:12,628 --> 01:33:17,203
<i>~ When did he grow to be so tall? ~</i>

1086
01:33:19,131 --> 01:33:29,262
<i>~ Wasn't it yesterday</i>
<i>when they were small? ~</i>

1087
01:33:33,687 --> 01:33:39,719
<i>~ Sunrise, sunset,</i>
<i>sunrise, sunset ~</i>

1088
01:33:39,823 --> 01:33:46,311
<i>~ Swiftly flow the days ~</i>

1089
01:33:46,415 --> 01:33:52,856
<i>~ Seedlings turn overnight to sunflowers ~</i>

1090
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:59,409
<i>~ Blossoming even as we gaze ~</i>

1091
01:33:59,963 --> 01:34:05,829
<i>~ Sunrise, sunset,</i>
<i>sunrise, sunset ~</i>

1092
01:34:05,934 --> 01:34:12,210
<i>~ Swiftly fly the years ~</i>

1093
01:34:12,314 --> 01:34:18,674
<i>~ One season following another ~</i>

1094
01:34:18,778 --> 01:34:27,279
<i>~ Laden with happiness and tears ~</i>

1095
01:34:31,119 --> 01:34:38,112
<i>~ What words of wisdom</i>
<i>can I give them? ~</i>

1096
01:34:38,216 --> 01:34:44,536
<i>~ How can I help to ease their way? ~</i>

1097
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:51,126
<i>~ Now they must</i>
<i>learn from one another ~</i>

1098
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:57,255
<i>~ Day by day ~</i>

1099
01:34:57,359 --> 01:35:03,514
<i>~ They look so natural together ~</i>

1100
01:35:03,618 --> 01:35:09,936
<i>~ Just like two newlyweds</i>
<i>should be ~</i>

1101
01:35:10,041 --> 01:35:20,497
<i>~ Is there a canopy in store for me? ~</i>

1102
01:35:24,756 --> 01:35:31,498
<i>~ Sunrise, sunset,</i>
<i>sunrise, sunset ~</i>

1103
01:35:31,603 --> 01:35:37,712
<i>~ Swiftly fly the years ~</i>

1104
01:35:37,816 --> 01:35:45,470
<i>~ One season following another ~</i>

1105
01:35:45,574 --> 01:35:50,685
<i>~ Laden with happiness ~</i>

1106
01:35:50,790 --> 01:35:58,078
<i>~ And tears ~</i>

1107
01:36:10,469 --> 01:36:11,963
Mazel tov!

1108
01:37:13,657 --> 01:37:16,990
Quiet down. Quiet down.

1109
01:37:22,749 --> 01:37:25,157
Quiet down.

1110
01:40:10,834 --> 01:40:14,031
Take your places, everybody. Quiet!

1111
01:40:14,135 --> 01:40:18,452
Quiet down. Quiet down.

1112
01:40:18,556 --> 01:40:20,914
Quiet down.

1113
01:40:21,018 --> 01:40:23,087
Sha!

1114
01:40:24,681 --> 01:40:26,879
The newlyweds.

1115
01:40:26,983 --> 01:40:33,340
Friends, we are gathered here
to share in the joys of the newlyweds,

1116
01:40:33,444 --> 01:40:35,638
Motel and Tzeitel.

1117
01:40:35,742 --> 01:40:38,847
May they live together to a ripe old age.

1118
01:40:38,952 --> 01:40:41,770
- Amen.
Amen.

1119
01:40:41,874 --> 01:40:45,644
- And now I want to say...
- Ni, ni, ni, ni, ni...

1120
01:40:45,748 --> 01:40:47,398
Reb Nachum...

1121
01:40:47,502 --> 01:40:51,070
Please not here.

1122
01:40:51,174 --> 01:40:56,199
I'd like to announce the bride's parents
are giving the newlyweds the following:

1123
01:40:56,303 --> 01:40:59,659
A new feather bed, two pillows.

1124
01:40:59,763 --> 01:41:02,289
Goose pillows.

1125
01:41:02,393 --> 01:41:05,915
A Sabbath tablecloth.

1126
01:41:06,019 --> 01:41:08,137
And a pair of candlesticks.

1127
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,069
Quiet!

1128
01:41:13,174 --> 01:41:14,989
Now,

1129
01:41:15,093 --> 01:41:18,201
we are just here on earth
for a short visit.

1130
01:41:18,305 --> 01:41:22,371
Even the great and wealthy must die.

1131
01:41:22,476 --> 01:41:27,253
In fact, if the rich could hire others
to die for them,

1132
01:41:27,358 --> 01:41:31,014
we, the poor, would all make a nice living.

1133
01:41:32,271 --> 01:41:34,809
Well put. Well put.

1134
01:41:36,025 --> 01:41:39,559
Lazar Wolf, talking about the rich,

1135
01:41:40,279 --> 01:41:43,892
there sits our good friend Lazar Wolf.

1136
01:41:43,996 --> 01:41:49,910
Lazar has everything in the world,
except a bride.

1137
01:41:50,831 --> 01:41:53,945
But Lazar has no ill feelings.

1138
01:41:54,049 --> 01:41:59,909
In fact, he told me he has a gift for the
newlyweds that he wants to announce.

1139
01:42:00,013 --> 01:42:03,091
Come on. Come on!

1140
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:11,628
Just like he said, I have no ill feelings.

1141
01:42:11,732 --> 01:42:15,584
What's done is done.

1142
01:42:15,688 --> 01:42:20,423
I am giving the newlyweds five chickens.

1143
01:42:20,528 --> 01:42:28,352
One for each of the first five
Sabbaths of their wedded life.

1144
01:42:35,662 --> 01:42:37,899
Reb Lazar Wolf,

1145
01:42:38,003 --> 01:42:40,235
you are a decent man.

1146
01:42:40,339 --> 01:42:45,701
On behalf of my daughter
and her new husband,

1147
01:42:45,805 --> 01:42:48,502
I accept your gift.

1148
01:42:48,842 --> 01:42:50,745
There is a famous saying...

1149
01:42:50,850 --> 01:42:54,041
Reb Tevye,
I'm not marrying your daughter.

1150
01:42:54,146 --> 01:42:56,881
I don't have to listen to your sayings.

1151
01:42:56,985 --> 01:42:58,546
If you would only listen...

1152
01:42:58,650 --> 01:43:03,466
Why should I listen to you?
A man who breaks an agreement.

1153
01:43:03,571 --> 01:43:06,890
- I have a right to talk.
- What right? It's not your wedding.

1154
01:43:06,994 --> 01:43:09,977
- It should have been.
- It's not, thank goodness.

1155
01:43:10,081 --> 01:43:11,770
Sit down.

1156
01:43:11,875 --> 01:43:17,286
He shamed me
in front of the whole village.

1157
01:43:17,788 --> 01:43:20,357
Sha!

1158
01:43:20,461 --> 01:43:23,571
Rabbi, say something.

1159
01:43:23,675 --> 01:43:25,745
I say...

1160
01:43:26,797 --> 01:43:30,842
I say, let's sit down.

1161
01:43:31,927 --> 01:43:35,501
Yes, yes.
We all heard the words of the rabbi.

1162
01:43:35,606 --> 01:43:37,545
Let's sit down.

1163
01:43:37,649 --> 01:43:40,891
Now I'm going to sing a little song.

1164
01:43:43,564 --> 01:43:47,893
<i>~ Dai-dai dai</i>
<i>deedle deedle dai-dai ~</i>

1165
01:43:49,737 --> 01:43:53,106
I don't want your apple.
Leave me alone.

1166
01:43:55,200 --> 01:43:57,731
You can keep your diseased chickens.

1167
01:43:57,835 --> 01:44:00,985
You leave my chickens out of this.

1168
01:44:01,090 --> 01:44:04,239
- We made a bargain.
- The terms weren't settled.

1169
01:44:04,343 --> 01:44:06,865
- We drank on it.
- Terms weren't settled.

1170
01:44:06,969 --> 01:44:08,826
You just sit down, all right?

1171
01:44:08,931 --> 01:44:11,492
Once a butcher, always a butcher.

1172
01:44:11,596 --> 01:44:14,842
- Once a liar, always a liar.
- Sit down, all right?

1173
01:44:15,721 --> 01:44:19,250
Those happen to be my chickens...

1174
01:44:19,355 --> 01:44:23,846
- I had a sign.
- Quiet, I'm singing.

1175
01:44:24,188 --> 01:44:27,550
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

1176
01:44:27,655 --> 01:44:30,052
What's all the screaming about?

1177
01:44:30,156 --> 01:44:32,683
They drank on it. An agreement.

1178
01:44:32,787 --> 01:44:35,643
A sign. It's all nonsense.

1179
01:44:35,747 --> 01:44:38,604
Tzeitel wanted to marry Motel
and not Lazar.

1180
01:44:38,708 --> 01:44:40,855
A young girl decides for herself?

1181
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,152
Why not? They love each other.

1182
01:44:43,257 --> 01:44:46,028
- Love?
- He's a radical.

1183
01:44:46,133 --> 01:44:50,949
Musicians, play.
It's a dance. Everybody, dance.

1184
01:44:51,053 --> 01:44:53,579
- It's a wedding.
Some wedding

1185
01:44:53,683 --> 01:44:55,745
- What is he doing?
- Perchik!

1186
01:44:55,850 --> 01:44:58,503
Who will dance with me?

1187
01:44:58,608 --> 01:45:00,917
- That's a sin.
- It's no sin to dance.

1188
01:45:01,021 --> 01:45:02,548
- With a girl?
- Yes!

1189
01:45:02,652 --> 01:45:05,840
That's what comes
from taking a wild man into your house.

1190
01:45:05,944 --> 01:45:10,555
He's not a wild man. His ideas are
a bit different, but... Perchik, come here.

1191
01:45:10,659 --> 01:45:13,431
- It's a sin.
- It's no sin!

1192
01:45:13,535 --> 01:45:16,732
Ask the rabbi. Go on, ask him.

1193
01:45:18,158 --> 01:45:20,356
Well, Rabbi?

1194
01:45:20,461 --> 01:45:22,439
Dancing?

1195
01:45:22,543 --> 01:45:25,651
Well, it's not exactly forbidden.

1196
01:45:25,755 --> 01:45:28,196
There you see. It's not forbidden.

1197
01:45:28,301 --> 01:45:31,157
And it's no sin. Now...

1198
01:45:31,261 --> 01:45:34,375
Who will dance with me?

1199
01:45:44,727 --> 01:45:49,104
- Hodel!
- It's only a dance, Mama.

1200
01:45:51,775 --> 01:45:53,851
Play.

1201
01:46:10,711 --> 01:46:15,954
- She's dancing with a man.
- I can see that she's dancing with a man.

1202
01:46:19,470 --> 01:46:23,419
- And I'm going to dance with my wife!
- Tevye!

1203
01:46:24,808 --> 01:46:26,673
- Mama, no.
- Golde.

1204
01:46:26,777 --> 01:46:28,845
Golde!

1205
01:46:29,355 --> 01:46:31,228
Golde!

1206
01:46:33,609 --> 01:46:35,096
- No, I will not.
- Tzeitel!

1207
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:37,067
Motel!

1208
01:46:42,826 --> 01:46:46,401
You see that?
You are responsible for that.

1209
01:46:46,505 --> 01:46:49,996
- And I can't stand it.
- I tried my best.

1210
01:46:59,635 --> 01:47:02,042
Everybody dance.

1211
01:47:21,865 --> 01:47:24,435
Come on. Dance, Rabbi, dance!

1212
01:47:24,539 --> 01:47:26,611
Hey!

1213
01:48:16,670 --> 01:48:17,713
Go on!

1214
01:48:37,649 --> 01:48:39,303
Perchik!

1215
01:48:39,407 --> 01:48:42,153
Perchik!

1216
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:47,655
All right! Enough!

1217
01:48:52,331 --> 01:48:55,581
I said, enough! Come!

1218
01:49:12,226 --> 01:49:14,379
Orders are orders.

1219
01:49:14,483 --> 01:49:16,767
You understand?

1220
01:49:52,599 --> 01:49:54,675
Well...

1221
01:49:56,353 --> 01:49:59,722
Why are you all standing around?

1222
01:50:00,733 --> 01:50:02,809
Clean up.

1223
01:50:06,196 --> 01:50:08,522
Clean up!

1224
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:27,832
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

1225
01:53:27,936 --> 01:53:29,801
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

1226
01:53:30,931 --> 01:53:32,207
<i>~ Tradition! ~</i>

1227
01:53:32,311 --> 01:53:34,627
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

1228
01:53:34,731 --> 01:53:36,600
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

1229
01:53:37,646 --> 01:53:39,519
<i>~ Tradition! ~</i>

1230
01:54:02,754 --> 01:54:06,088
Troubles, troubles.

1231
01:54:07,133 --> 01:54:10,708
That's all you hear from me, right?

1232
01:54:10,812 --> 01:54:16,759
But who else can we simple people
take our troubles to?

1233
01:54:18,812 --> 01:54:24,268
You know, sometimes I wonder,
who do you take your troubles to?

1234
01:54:27,487 --> 01:54:30,358
Ah, go away.

1235
01:54:36,162 --> 01:54:41,501
Anyway, Motel and Tzeitel
have been married for some time now.

1236
01:54:43,461 --> 01:54:46,325
They work very hard.

1237
01:54:46,429 --> 01:54:52,342
And they're as poor as squirrels in winter.

1238
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:58,887
But they're so happy,
they don't know how miserable they are.

1239
01:55:05,525 --> 01:55:09,182
Motel keeps talking about
a sewing machine.

1240
01:55:09,286 --> 01:55:13,269
I know. You are very busy now.

1241
01:55:13,374 --> 01:55:15,936
Wars, revolutions, floods, plagues.

1242
01:55:16,040 --> 01:55:21,069
All those little things
that bring people back to you.

1243
01:55:21,173 --> 01:55:27,880
But couldn't you take a second
and get him his sewing machine?

1244
01:55:28,465 --> 01:55:32,871
Yeah, and while
you are in the neighbourhood...

1245
01:55:32,975 --> 01:55:37,042
As you can see, my horse's leg...

1246
01:55:37,146 --> 01:55:39,671
Am I bothering you too much?

1247
01:55:39,775 --> 01:55:43,969
I'm sorry. As the Good Book says...

1248
01:55:44,073 --> 01:55:48,476
Why should I tell <i>you</i>
what the Good Book says?!

1249
01:55:56,409 --> 01:55:59,023
So you must go away?

1250
01:55:59,128 --> 01:56:00,941
Yes.

1251
01:56:01,045 --> 01:56:03,486
So soon?

1252
01:56:03,590 --> 01:56:05,486
Yes.

1253
01:56:05,590 --> 01:56:07,910
Tomorrow morning.

1254
01:56:12,092 --> 01:56:13,413
Alone?

1255
01:56:13,517 --> 01:56:16,585
No, with a few friends.
And we will be joining others.

1256
01:56:16,689 --> 01:56:19,959
- Where?
- In the city, Kiev.

1257
01:56:20,063 --> 01:56:25,265
Hodel, there are some things
I cannot tell even you.

1258
01:56:26,481 --> 01:56:28,557
I see.

1259
01:56:29,609 --> 01:56:33,849
- Please don't be upset.
- If you must leave, you must.

1260
01:56:33,953 --> 01:56:36,349
- I do have to.
- So you told me.

1261
01:56:36,454 --> 01:56:41,483
Great changes are about to take place.
Tremendous changes.

1262
01:56:41,587 --> 01:56:43,943
But they can't happen by themselves.

1263
01:56:44,048 --> 01:56:48,075
- So you feel that you, personally, must...
- Not only me. Many people.

1264
01:56:48,179 --> 01:56:52,287
Jews, Gentiles, many people hate
what's going on. Don't you understand?

1265
01:56:52,391 --> 01:56:55,539
I understand, of course.

1266
01:56:55,644 --> 01:56:58,249
You want to leave.

1267
01:56:58,354 --> 01:57:01,626
Then, goodbye.

1268
01:57:01,730 --> 01:57:03,628
Hodel, listen to me.

1269
01:57:03,732 --> 01:57:08,934
I have work to do.
The greatest work a man can do.

1270
01:57:11,776 --> 01:57:14,777
Don't you understand?

1271
01:57:15,864 --> 01:57:18,355
Yes, Perchik.

1272
01:57:22,370 --> 01:57:24,446
Hodel... Hodel!

1273
01:57:25,457 --> 01:57:27,655
Hodel, wait.

1274
01:57:27,759 --> 01:57:32,035
Hodel, there's a certain question
I wish to discuss with you.

1275
01:57:32,139 --> 01:57:34,789
- Yes?
- It's a political question.

1276
01:57:34,893 --> 01:57:39,759
- What is it?
- The question of... marriage.

1277
01:57:42,140 --> 01:57:44,754
Is this a political question?

1278
01:57:44,858 --> 01:57:46,715
Well, yes.

1279
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:49,969
Everything's political.

1280
01:57:50,073 --> 01:57:56,233
The relationship between a man and
a woman has a socioeconomic base.

1281
01:57:57,572 --> 01:58:02,395
Marriage must be
founded on mutual beliefs.

1282
01:58:02,499 --> 01:58:05,569
A common attitude
and philosophy towards society...

1283
01:58:05,673 --> 01:58:08,027
And affection?

1284
01:58:08,132 --> 01:58:10,239
Yes, of course.

1285
01:58:10,343 --> 01:58:13,742
That is also necessary.

1286
01:58:13,847 --> 01:58:18,539
Such a relationship
can have positive social values.

1287
01:58:18,643 --> 01:58:22,791
When two people face the world
with unity and solidarity...

1288
01:58:22,895 --> 01:58:27,635
- And affection?
- Yes, that is an important element.

1289
01:58:30,563 --> 01:58:33,049
At any rate, I...

1290
01:58:33,154 --> 01:58:38,226
I personally am in favour of
such a socioeconomic relationship.

1291
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:43,484
I think...

1292
01:58:44,703 --> 01:58:47,538
you are asking me to marry you.

1293
01:58:49,499 --> 01:58:51,530
Well,

1294
01:58:51,635 --> 01:58:56,253
in a theoretical sense, yes, I am.

1295
01:58:57,632 --> 01:58:59,755
I was hoping you were.

1296
01:59:04,264 --> 01:59:07,294
I am very happy, Hodel.

1297
01:59:07,398 --> 01:59:10,227
I'm very, very happy.

1298
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:43,875
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Reb Tevye.

1299
01:59:43,980 --> 01:59:47,211
- I have some bad news.
- What?

1300
01:59:47,315 --> 01:59:49,754
- I must leave here.
- When?

1301
01:59:49,858 --> 01:59:54,219
- Tomorrow morning.
- I'm sorry to hear that, Perchik.

1302
01:59:54,323 --> 01:59:57,927
- We'll all miss you.
- But I also have some good news.

1303
01:59:58,031 --> 02:00:00,096
- Good.
- You can congratulate me.

1304
02:00:00,200 --> 02:00:03,475
- Congratulations. What for?
- We are engaged.

1305
02:00:04,190 --> 02:00:07,090
- Engaged?
- Yes, Papa, we're engaged.

1306
02:00:07,195 --> 02:00:12,091
Oh, no, you're not.
I know you like him and he likes you.

1307
02:00:12,195 --> 02:00:15,930
But you're going away
and you're staying here.

1308
02:00:16,035 --> 02:00:18,974
So have a nice trip,
and I hope you'll be very happy

1309
02:00:19,078 --> 02:00:21,103
and my answer is no.

1310
02:00:21,208 --> 02:00:24,440
- Papa, you don't understand.
- I understand.

1311
02:00:24,544 --> 02:00:29,819
I gave my permission to Motel and
Tzeitel, so you feel you also have a right.

1312
02:00:29,924 --> 02:00:32,863
I'm sorry, Perchik, I like you.

1313
02:00:32,967 --> 02:00:36,075
But you're going away,
so go in good health,

1314
02:00:36,179 --> 02:00:38,120
and my answer is still no.

1315
02:00:38,225 --> 02:00:42,668
- You don't understand, Papa.
- And you are not listening. I said no.

1316
02:00:42,772 --> 02:00:45,920
Reb Tevye, we are not asking
for your permission.

1317
02:00:46,024 --> 02:00:49,340
Only for your blessing.

1318
02:00:49,444 --> 02:00:53,564
We <i>are</i> going to get married.

1319
02:00:58,403 --> 02:01:02,401
You are not asking for my permission?

1320
02:01:04,576 --> 02:01:08,870
But we would like your blessing, Papa.

1321
02:01:12,250 --> 02:01:15,114
I can't believe my own ears.

1322
02:01:15,218 --> 02:01:17,826
My blessing? For what?

1323
02:01:17,930 --> 02:01:21,957
<i>~ For going over my head - impossible ~</i>

1324
02:01:22,061 --> 02:01:26,208
<i>~ At least with Tzeitel and Motel</i>
<i>they asked me, they begged me ~</i>

1325
02:01:26,312 --> 02:01:30,085
<i>~ But now, if I like or not,</i>
<i>you'll marry him ~</i>

1326
02:01:30,189 --> 02:01:33,880
<i>~ What do you want from me -</i>
<i>go on, be wed ~</i>

1327
02:01:33,985 --> 02:01:39,354
<i>~ And tear out my beard</i>
<i>and uncover my head ~</i>

1328
02:01:41,780 --> 02:01:43,600
<i>~ Tradition ~</i>

1329
02:01:43,705 --> 02:01:48,354
<i>~ They're not even asking permission</i>
<i>from the papa ~</i>

1330
02:01:48,458 --> 02:01:50,773
<i>~ What's happening to the tradition? ~</i>

1331
02:01:50,877 --> 02:01:55,362
<i>~ One little time, I pulled out a thread</i>
<i>and where has it led? Where has it led? ~</i>

1332
02:01:55,466 --> 02:01:57,780
Where has it led? To this.

1333
02:01:57,884 --> 02:02:02,580
A man tells me he's getting married.
He doesn't ask me, he tells me.

1334
02:02:02,684 --> 02:02:04,874
But first, he abandons you.

1335
02:02:04,978 --> 02:02:07,084
He's not abandoning me, Papa.

1336
02:02:07,189 --> 02:02:10,959
As soon as I can,
I will send for her and marry her.

1337
02:02:11,063 --> 02:02:13,135
I love her.

1338
02:02:16,064 --> 02:02:18,353
He loves her.

1339
02:02:19,359 --> 02:02:23,727
Love. It's a new style.

1340
02:02:23,831 --> 02:02:25,725
On the other hand,

1341
02:02:25,829 --> 02:02:30,275
our old ways were once new,
weren't they?

1342
02:02:30,379 --> 02:02:33,733
On the other hand,
they decided without parents,

1343
02:02:33,837 --> 02:02:37,029
without the matchmaker.

1344
02:02:37,133 --> 02:02:39,158
On the other hand,

1345
02:02:39,262 --> 02:02:44,204
did Adam and Eve have a matchmaker?

1346
02:02:44,308 --> 02:02:47,996
Oh, yes, they did.

1347
02:02:48,100 --> 02:02:53,303
And it seems these two
have the same matchmaker.

1348
02:02:56,980 --> 02:02:59,594
They're going over my head.

1349
02:02:59,698 --> 02:03:02,138
Unheard of. Absurd.

1350
02:03:02,243 --> 02:03:08,267
<i>~ For this, they want</i>
<i>to be blessed - unthinkable ~</i>

1351
02:03:08,372 --> 02:03:10,897
I'll lock her up in her room.

1352
02:03:11,001 --> 02:03:13,902
I couldn't. I should.

1353
02:03:14,006 --> 02:03:17,488
<i>~ But look at my daughter's eyes ~</i>

1354
02:03:17,592 --> 02:03:20,668
<i>~ She loves him ~</i>

1355
02:03:23,673 --> 02:03:28,003
Tradition!

1356
02:03:32,974 --> 02:03:38,561
Well, children, I've decided to give you
my blessing <i>and</i> my permission.

1357
02:03:40,273 --> 02:03:44,180
Oh, thank you, Papa.

1358
02:03:44,285 --> 02:03:46,014
What else could I do?

1359
02:03:46,119 --> 02:03:47,939
Thank you, Papa.

1360
02:03:48,114 --> 02:03:51,032
"Thank you, Papa"?

1361
02:03:52,661 --> 02:03:55,275
What am I going to tell your mother?

1362
02:03:55,379 --> 02:03:57,863
Another dream?

1363
02:04:00,293 --> 02:04:03,906
Perhaps if you tell her
I am going to visit a rich uncle.

1364
02:04:04,011 --> 02:04:08,466
Perchik, please.
I can handle my own wife.

1365
02:04:09,219 --> 02:04:12,339
Golde! Golde!

1366
02:04:13,056 --> 02:04:15,179
- Gol...
- Hm?

1367
02:04:17,394 --> 02:04:20,514
- Hello, Golde.
- Have some soup.

1368
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:26,066
Golde...

1369
02:04:27,237 --> 02:04:30,267
I have something
very important to tell you.

1370
02:04:30,371 --> 02:04:33,699
Have the soup. It's warm.

1371
02:04:38,415 --> 02:04:40,289
Golde.

1372
02:04:41,293 --> 02:04:45,071
I've just met Perchik and Hodel.

1373
02:04:45,176 --> 02:04:47,460
- Well?
- Well...

1374
02:04:48,758 --> 02:04:50,995
Well, uh...

1375
02:04:51,099 --> 02:04:54,669
Well, they seem to be
very fond of each other.

1376
02:04:54,773 --> 02:04:57,137
So? What do you mean?

1377
02:04:57,893 --> 02:04:59,766
So...

1378
02:05:01,938 --> 02:05:07,554
So, I've decided to give them
my permission to become engaged.

1379
02:05:07,659 --> 02:05:09,555
- I'll eat later.
- What?

1380
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:12,895
Just like that, without even asking me?

1381
02:05:12,999 --> 02:05:15,482
Who asks you?

1382
02:05:16,495 --> 02:05:19,192
- I am the father.
- Who is he?

1383
02:05:19,296 --> 02:05:23,868
A pauper. He has nothing,
absolutely nothing.

1384
02:05:26,171 --> 02:05:29,088
I wouldn't say that.

1385
02:05:31,301 --> 02:05:34,875
I hear he has a rich uncle.

1386
02:05:34,980 --> 02:05:38,091
A rich uncle.

1387
02:05:42,479 --> 02:05:44,353
Golde...

1388
02:05:46,274 --> 02:05:49,266
Golde, he's a good man.

1389
02:05:49,370 --> 02:05:54,477
I like him.
He's a little crazy, but I like him.

1390
02:05:54,582 --> 02:05:59,651
And what's more important,

1391
02:06:00,914 --> 02:06:03,405
Hodel likes him.

1392
02:06:04,751 --> 02:06:07,456
Hodel loves him.

1393
02:06:09,548 --> 02:06:12,667
So what can we do?

1394
02:06:14,010 --> 02:06:18,083
It's a new world, Golde.

1395
02:06:18,187 --> 02:06:20,886
A new world.

1396
02:06:22,769 --> 02:06:24,845
Love.

1397
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:30,806
Golde,

1398
02:06:30,911 --> 02:06:33,358
do you love me?

1399
02:06:33,989 --> 02:06:36,058
- Do I what?
- Shh.

1400
02:06:36,163 --> 02:06:38,982
<i>~ Do you love me? ~</i>

1401
02:06:39,086 --> 02:06:41,358
<i>~ Do I love you? ~</i>

1402
02:06:41,462 --> 02:06:42,858
Well?

1403
02:06:42,962 --> 02:06:47,362
<i>~ With our daughters getting married</i>
<i>and this trouble in the town ~</i>

1404
02:06:47,467 --> 02:06:51,458
<i>~ You're upset, you're worn out,</i>
<i>go inside, go lie down ~</i>

1405
02:06:52,007 --> 02:06:58,250
- Maybe it's indigestion.
- No, Golde, I'm asking you a question.

1406
02:06:58,355 --> 02:07:00,960
<i>~ Do you love me? ~</i>

1407
02:07:01,065 --> 02:07:04,049
- You're a fool.
- I know.

1408
02:07:04,153 --> 02:07:07,468
<i>~ But do you love me? ~</i>

1409
02:07:07,572 --> 02:07:11,093
<i>~ Do I love you?</i>
<i>Well? ~</i>

1410
02:07:11,198 --> 02:07:14,267
<i>~ For 25 years, I've washed your clothes ~</i>

1411
02:07:14,372 --> 02:07:16,810
<i>~ Cooked your meals,</i>
<i>cleaned your house ~</i>

1412
02:07:16,914 --> 02:07:19,770
<i>~ Given you children, milked your cow ~</i>

1413
02:07:19,874 --> 02:07:24,984
<i>~ After 25 years,</i>
<i>why talk about love right now? ~</i>

1414
02:07:25,089 --> 02:07:26,697
Golde.

1415
02:07:26,801 --> 02:07:31,159
<i>~ The first time I met you</i>
<i>was on our wedding day ~</i>

1416
02:07:31,264 --> 02:07:33,702
<i>~ I was scared</i>
<i>I was shy ~</i>

1417
02:07:33,806 --> 02:07:36,790
<i>~ I was nervous</i>
<i>So was I ~</i>

1418
02:07:36,894 --> 02:07:42,584
<i>~ But my father and my mother said</i>
<i>we'd learn to love each other ~</i>

1419
02:07:42,689 --> 02:07:45,712
<i>~ And now I'm asking, Golde ~</i>

1420
02:07:45,817 --> 02:07:48,552
<i>~ Do you love me? ~</i>

1421
02:07:48,656 --> 02:07:51,388
- I'm your wife.
- I know.

1422
02:07:51,492 --> 02:07:54,603
<i>~ But do you love me? ~</i>

1423
02:07:55,779 --> 02:07:58,309
<i>~ Do I love him? ~</i>

1424
02:07:58,414 --> 02:08:00,726
Well?

1425
02:08:00,831 --> 02:08:03,484
<i>~ For 25 years, I've lived with him ~</i>

1426
02:08:03,589 --> 02:08:06,403
<i>~ Fought with him, starved with him ~</i>

1427
02:08:06,507 --> 02:08:10,738
<i>~ 25 years, my bed is his ~</i>
<i>Shh!</i>

1428
02:08:10,842 --> 02:08:14,576
<i>~ If that's not love, what is? ~</i>

1429
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:18,505
<i>~ Then you love me? ~</i>

1430
02:08:19,219 --> 02:08:21,295
I suppose I do.

1431
02:08:23,765 --> 02:08:29,139
<i>~ And I suppose I love you, too ~</i>

1432
02:08:31,690 --> 02:08:36,096
<i>~ It doesn't change a thing ~</i>

1433
02:08:36,200 --> 02:08:40,479
<i>~ But even so ~</i>

1434
02:08:40,583 --> 02:08:45,366
<i>~ After 25 years ~</i>

1435
02:08:47,122 --> 02:08:55,876
<i>~ It's nice to know ~</i>

1436
02:09:20,447 --> 02:09:22,736
Halt!

1437
02:09:29,247 --> 02:09:32,987
There is no authority
above the will of the people.

1438
02:09:33,092 --> 02:09:35,948
And we are the people.

1439
02:09:36,052 --> 02:09:39,296
We are Russia!

1440
02:09:41,259 --> 02:09:45,304
The time has come,
and the time is now.

1441
02:09:46,348 --> 02:09:50,126
We stand here before you.
Not one, but many.

1442
02:09:50,231 --> 02:09:52,425
Many like you.

1443
02:09:52,529 --> 02:09:58,220
Students, workers
striving for a better life.

1444
02:09:58,324 --> 02:10:03,979
And I urge you, fellow workers,
to band together with us.

1445
02:10:04,083 --> 02:10:08,108
Join our movement, in the factories.

1446
02:10:08,212 --> 02:10:10,862
In the schools.

1447
02:10:10,966 --> 02:10:13,441
In the army.

1448
02:10:13,546 --> 02:10:19,580
The winds of freedom
are beginning to blow all over Russia.

1449
02:10:39,234 --> 02:10:41,310
Halt!

1450
02:10:49,828 --> 02:10:52,366
Wait! Wait! Stand!

1451
02:11:18,523 --> 02:11:20,599
Good day to you, Esther.

1452
02:11:23,236 --> 02:11:26,266
Just a minute. Tzeitel. Tzeitel.

1453
02:11:26,371 --> 02:11:29,023
- Good day, Yente.
- Tzeitel.

1454
02:11:29,128 --> 02:11:34,067
I happened to stop in the post office
today, to say hello, see what's what.

1455
02:11:34,171 --> 02:11:37,194
It doesn't cost anything to be friendly.

1456
02:11:37,298 --> 02:11:39,445
So few people are like that.

1457
02:11:39,549 --> 02:11:42,203
- Ni, ni.
- People.

1458
02:11:42,307 --> 02:11:47,791
I tell you, if God lived on earth,
people would break his windows.

1459
02:11:47,895 --> 02:11:51,210
- So you went to the post office.
- Yes, and the postman told me

1460
02:11:51,314 --> 02:11:54,003
there was a letter for your sister Hodel.

1461
02:11:54,108 --> 02:11:57,258
- Thanks, I'll go get it.
- I got it.

1462
02:11:57,362 --> 02:11:59,756
It's from her intended - Perchik.

1463
02:11:59,860 --> 02:12:04,557
Hodel will be so happy.
She's been waiting to hear from him...

1464
02:12:04,661 --> 02:12:08,602
- But it's open.
- So it happened to be open.

1465
02:12:35,058 --> 02:12:40,213
You don't have to wait for the
train, Papa. You'll be late for customers.

1466
02:12:40,318 --> 02:12:42,345
It's all right.

1467
02:12:42,449 --> 02:12:46,604
They'll just have to wait for a while.

1468
02:12:55,178 --> 02:12:58,419
Is he in bad trouble,

1469
02:12:58,523 --> 02:13:02,263
that hero of yours?

1470
02:13:04,354 --> 02:13:06,430
Arrested?

1471
02:13:08,525 --> 02:13:12,220
- Convicted?
- Yes. But he did nothing wrong.

1472
02:13:12,324 --> 02:13:16,810
He cares nothing for himself.
Everything he does is for other people.

1473
02:13:16,914 --> 02:13:21,315
Yes, but if he did nothing wrong,
he wouldn't be in trouble.

1474
02:13:21,419 --> 02:13:24,859
Papa, how can you say that?

1475
02:13:24,963 --> 02:13:30,325
What wrongs did Joseph do,
and Abraham, and Moses?

1476
02:13:30,429 --> 02:13:32,536
And they had troubles.

1477
02:13:32,641 --> 02:13:35,291
Yes, but...

1478
02:13:35,395 --> 02:13:41,500
Why won't you tell me where he is now,

1479
02:13:41,605 --> 02:13:45,174
this Joseph of yours?

1480
02:13:45,278 --> 02:13:48,354
It is far, Papa.

1481
02:13:49,566 --> 02:13:51,772
Terribly far.

1482
02:13:54,696 --> 02:13:58,897
He is in a settlement in Siberia.

1483
02:13:59,001 --> 02:14:01,068
Siberia?

1484
02:14:02,454 --> 02:14:07,443
And he asks you
to leave your father and mother

1485
02:14:07,547 --> 02:14:13,574
and join him in that frozen wasteland
and marry him there?

1486
02:14:13,678 --> 02:14:18,041
No, Papa.
He did not ask me to go.

1487
02:14:18,145 --> 02:14:22,504
I want to go.
I don't want him to be alone.

1488
02:14:22,608 --> 02:14:25,340
I want to help him in his work.

1489
02:14:25,444 --> 02:14:29,130
- Hodel.
- Papa.

1490
02:14:29,235 --> 02:14:33,682
<i>~ How can I hope</i>
<i>to make you understand? ~</i>

1491
02:14:33,786 --> 02:14:39,144

02:15:43,979 --> 02:15:49,300

<i>~ I'm home ~</i>

1513
02:16:52,749 --> 02:17:00,408
And who, my child, will there be
to perform a marriage in the wilderness?

1514
02:17:00,512 --> 02:17:05,662
Papa, I promise you,
we will be married under a canopy.

1515
02:17:05,766 --> 02:17:07,838
Yes. Yes.

1516
02:17:11,059 --> 02:17:17,014
No doubt a rabbi or two
were also arrested.

1517
02:18:01,259 --> 02:18:03,133
Papa!

1518
02:18:04,262 --> 02:18:08,556
God alone knows
when we shall see each other again.

1519
02:18:09,392 --> 02:18:14,469
Then we will leave it in his hands.

1520
02:18:51,059 --> 02:18:53,977
Take care of her.

1521
02:18:56,064 --> 02:19:00,358
See that she dresses warm.

1522
02:19:15,417 --> 02:19:22,909
Even though she only burned his cooking,
he is permitted to divorce her.

1523
02:19:23,013 --> 02:19:25,712
Just for supper?

1524
02:19:26,761 --> 02:19:28,793
I'm sorry, Rabbi.

1525
02:19:28,897 --> 02:19:32,213
Yes, of course.
What news of the outside world?

1526
02:19:32,317 --> 02:19:34,878
- Terrible, Rabbi.
- Then don't tell me.

1527
02:19:34,982 --> 02:19:39,355
If I want bad news,
I'll read about Noah and the flood.

1528
02:19:41,401 --> 02:19:43,432
Tell me, Avram,

1529
02:19:43,537 --> 02:19:47,729
surely somewhere
there are good things happening?

1530
02:19:47,834 --> 02:19:51,648
Can't you buy a paper
that prints those things?

1531
02:19:51,752 --> 02:19:54,820
It's not my fault, Rabbi. I only read it.

1532
02:19:54,924 --> 02:19:57,151
Rabbi, did you hear the news?

1533
02:19:57,255 --> 02:19:59,781
- More bad news?
- No, good news.

1534
02:19:59,885 --> 02:20:02,786
At Motel's and Tzeitel's, a new arrival.

1535
02:20:02,890 --> 02:20:06,131
A new arrival at Motel and Tzeitel's!

1536
02:20:10,931 --> 02:20:14,044
We just heard the good news. Mazel tov.

1537
02:20:14,148 --> 02:20:16,379
Thank you very much.

1538
02:20:16,483 --> 02:20:18,342
It's a nice thing.

1539
02:20:18,446 --> 02:20:20,424
Very nice.

1540
02:20:20,529 --> 02:20:24,180
- What is it?
- It's a sewing machine.

1541
02:20:24,285 --> 02:20:26,308
You can work twice as fast.

1542
02:20:26,413 --> 02:20:30,145
- You got it.
- I got it.

1543
02:20:30,249 --> 02:20:32,522
- It's beautiful.
- I know.

1544
02:20:32,626 --> 02:20:36,149
- Have you tried it yet?
- Look.

1545
02:20:36,253 --> 02:20:37,901
- Beautiful.
- I know.

1546
02:20:38,006 --> 02:20:41,945
And in less than a minute.
See how close and even the stitches are.

1547
02:20:42,049 --> 02:20:43,744
- It's beautiful.
- I know.

1548
02:20:43,848 --> 02:20:46,952
From now on, my clothes will be perfect.

1549
02:20:47,056 --> 02:20:51,379
Made by machine.
No more handmade clothes.

1550
02:20:52,681 --> 02:20:55,635
- Look, Mama. Look.
- Oh.

1551
02:20:56,852 --> 02:21:01,885
It's wonderful.
Mazel tov, Motel.

1552
02:21:01,989 --> 02:21:04,899
- The rabbi. The rabbi.
- Shh. Shh.

1553
02:21:08,196 --> 02:21:11,059
Rabbi, is there a blessing
for a sewing machine?

1554
02:21:11,164 --> 02:21:15,155
There is a blessing for everything.

1555
02:21:23,712 --> 02:21:28,163
That's your new arrival?
What is it, a boy or a girl?

1556
02:21:28,267 --> 02:21:31,342
Well put. Well put.

1557
02:21:32,387 --> 02:21:35,174
Yankela. Yankela.

1558
02:21:37,225 --> 02:21:39,506
Why isn't he asleep?

1559
02:21:39,610 --> 02:21:42,382
But he's wonderful.
He never cries or anything...

1560
02:21:42,487 --> 02:21:45,927
Sha! Do you want to invite bad luck?

1561
02:21:46,031 --> 02:21:48,556
Aaah! Well...

1562
02:21:48,661 --> 02:21:50,934
Well, Motel.

1563
02:21:51,038 --> 02:21:53,939
I never thought
you'd amount to anything.

1564
02:21:54,043 --> 02:21:58,031
But look at you.
A baby and a sewing machine.

1565
02:21:58,955 --> 02:22:01,236
You're a person.

1566
02:22:01,340 --> 02:22:06,327
- Look, I'll show you how it works.
Go, children.

1567
02:22:07,714 --> 02:22:09,867
First, you put the cloth in like this.

1568
02:22:09,972 --> 02:22:14,675
It's an amazing thing.
You work it with your foot and your hand.

1569
02:22:23,355 --> 02:22:25,264
Your father is coming.

1570
02:22:28,401 --> 02:22:30,765
Chava, let me tell him about us.

1571
02:22:30,870 --> 02:22:33,348
That would be the worst thing.

1572
02:22:33,452 --> 02:22:35,518
- But let me try.
- No.

1573
02:22:35,622 --> 02:22:39,235
I'll talk to him, I promise.

1574
02:22:46,378 --> 02:22:49,408
Good afternoon, sir.

1575
02:22:49,512 --> 02:22:52,127
Good afternoon.

1576
02:22:55,136 --> 02:22:58,832
It's a cold day, isn't it?

1577
02:22:58,936 --> 02:23:00,806
Mm.

1578
02:23:03,770 --> 02:23:05,846
Well, uh...

1579
02:23:07,399 --> 02:23:09,641
Good day, sir.

1580
02:23:10,861 --> 02:23:13,980
- Good day, Chava.
- Good day.

1581
02:23:19,619 --> 02:23:23,526
What were you and he talking about?

1582
02:23:23,631 --> 02:23:26,743
Nothing. We were just talking.

1583
02:23:28,044 --> 02:23:30,120
Good.

1584
02:23:31,756 --> 02:23:33,630
Papa.

1585
02:23:34,676 --> 02:23:38,710
Fyedka and I, we've known each other
for a long time now, and...

1586
02:23:38,815 --> 02:23:40,875
Chaveleh,

1587
02:23:40,979 --> 02:23:47,173
I would be much happier if
you would remain friends from a distance.

1588
02:23:47,277 --> 02:23:54,181
You must not forget
who you are and who that man is.

1589
02:23:54,285 --> 02:23:56,765
- He has a name, Papa.
- Of course.

1590
02:23:56,869 --> 02:23:59,645
All creatures on earth have a name.

1591
02:23:59,749 --> 02:24:03,067
Fyedka is not a creature.
Fyedka is a man.

1592
02:24:03,171 --> 02:24:05,860
Who says he isn't?

1593
02:24:05,965 --> 02:24:11,112
It's just that he's a different kind of man.

1594
02:24:11,217 --> 02:24:13,199
As the Good Book says,

1595
02:24:13,303 --> 02:24:16,661
"Each shall seek his own kind."

1596
02:24:16,765 --> 02:24:21,128
In other words, a bird may love a fish,

1597
02:24:21,232 --> 02:24:25,552
but where would they
build a home together?

1598
02:24:28,438 --> 02:24:32,889
- The world is changing.
- No, Chaveleh.

1599
02:24:32,994 --> 02:24:34,599
No.

1600
02:24:34,704 --> 02:24:38,185
Some things do not change for us.

1601
02:24:38,290 --> 02:24:40,523
Some things will never change.

1602
02:24:42,369 --> 02:24:44,657
We don't feel that way.

1603
02:24:46,581 --> 02:24:48,657
We?

1604
02:24:49,292 --> 02:24:52,905
Fyedka and I.
We want to be married.

1605
02:24:53,010 --> 02:24:57,205
What? Are you out of your mind?

1606
02:24:57,310 --> 02:24:59,165
What?

1607
02:24:59,269 --> 02:25:03,961
Don't you understand what that means,
marrying outside of the faith?

1608
02:25:04,065 --> 02:25:07,752
- But, Papa.
- No! I said no!

1609
02:25:07,857 --> 02:25:10,716
Never talk about it again.

1610
02:25:10,820 --> 02:25:15,053
Never mention his name again.
Never see him again.

1611
02:25:15,158 --> 02:25:17,810
Never.

1612
02:25:17,915 --> 02:25:20,395
Do you understand me?

1613
02:25:22,534 --> 02:25:24,610
Yes, Papa.

1614
02:25:25,829 --> 02:25:28,664
I understand you.

1615
02:25:35,172 --> 02:25:38,202
You're finally here.
It's late for supper.

1616
02:25:38,306 --> 02:25:42,456
- I want to see Motel's new machine.
- You'll see it another time.

1617
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:48,131
Quiet, woman, because when
I get angry, even flies don't dare to fly!

1618
02:25:48,236 --> 02:25:52,882
I'm very frightened of you.
After we finish supper, I'll faint.

1619
02:25:52,986 --> 02:25:57,304
Golde, I am the man in the house.

1620
02:25:57,408 --> 02:25:59,722
I am the head of the family.

1621
02:25:59,826 --> 02:26:05,195
And I want to see
Motel's new machine now!

1622
02:26:10,123 --> 02:26:12,910
Now let's go home.

1623
02:27:41,381 --> 02:27:44,916
What are you doing here?
What do you want?

1624
02:27:45,677 --> 02:27:48,502
May I see His Honour, the priest?

1625
02:27:48,606 --> 02:27:50,666
- The Reverend Father?
- Yes.

1626
02:27:50,771 --> 02:27:53,380
Why do you want to see him?

1627
02:27:53,484 --> 02:27:57,688
It's a family matter. A personal matter.

1628
02:27:59,357 --> 02:28:02,682
- My daughter.
- Yes? What about your daughter?

1629
02:28:02,786 --> 02:28:06,307
Please, if I could speak with the p...

1630
02:28:06,411 --> 02:28:10,562
If I could speak
with the Reverend Father.

1631
02:28:10,667 --> 02:28:12,736
Please?

1632
02:28:13,914 --> 02:28:15,990
Wait here.

1633
02:28:52,118 --> 02:28:53,992
Tevye!

1634
02:28:56,706 --> 02:28:58,580
Tevye!

1635
02:29:05,632 --> 02:29:07,663
What is it?

1636
02:29:07,767 --> 02:29:09,829
It's Chava.

1637
02:29:09,933 --> 02:29:13,874
She left home this morning with Fyedka.

1638
02:29:13,978 --> 02:29:17,752
- What?
- I looked everywhere for her.

1639
02:29:17,857 --> 02:29:20,308
I even went to the priest.

1640
02:29:23,984 --> 02:29:27,103
He told me they were married.

1641
02:29:31,283 --> 02:29:32,898
Married?

1642
02:29:33,002 --> 02:29:34,985
Yes.

1643
02:29:38,748 --> 02:29:40,658
Well...

1644
02:29:41,459 --> 02:29:44,164
Go home, Golde.

1645
02:29:45,630 --> 02:29:48,577
We have other children at home.

1646
02:29:48,681 --> 02:29:51,916
You have work to do, I have work to do.

1647
02:29:52,020 --> 02:29:54,419
- Go home.
- But Chaveleh...

1648
02:29:55,098 --> 02:29:58,265
Chava is dead to us.

1649
02:30:00,896 --> 02:30:03,600
We'll forget her.

1650
02:30:04,524 --> 02:30:06,600
Go home.

1651
02:30:07,527 --> 02:30:10,647
Go home, Golde.

1652
02:30:30,217 --> 02:30:32,624
Oh...

1653
02:30:46,316 --> 02:30:52,189
<i>~ Little bird, little Chaveleh ~</i>

1654
02:30:52,322 --> 02:30:56,017
<i>~ I don't understand</i>
<i>what's happening today ~</i>

1655
02:30:56,122 --> 02:31:01,151
<i>~ Everything is all a blur ~</i>

1656
02:31:01,255 --> 02:31:04,822
<i>~ All I can see is a happy child ~</i>

1657
02:31:04,926 --> 02:31:09,286
<i>~ The sweet little bird you were, Chaveleh ~</i>

1658
02:31:09,390 --> 02:31:11,457
<i>~ Chaveleh ~</i>

1659
02:31:15,971 --> 02:31:22,131
<i>~ Little bird, little Chaveleh ~</i>

1660
02:31:22,235 --> 02:31:26,051
<i>~ You were always</i>
<i>such a pretty little thing ~</i>

1661
02:31:26,155 --> 02:31:30,359
<i>~ Everybody's favourite child ~</i>

1662
02:31:34,447 --> 02:31:38,060
<i>~ Gentle and kind and affectionate ~</i>

1663
02:31:38,165 --> 02:31:42,444
<i>~ What a sweet little bird</i>
<i>you were, Chaveleh ~</i>

1664
02:31:42,548 --> 02:31:44,615
<i>~ Chaveleh ~</i>

1665
02:33:13,797 --> 02:33:15,873
Papa.

1666
02:33:17,342 --> 02:33:19,418
Papa!

1667
02:33:22,097 --> 02:33:25,382
Papa, I've been looking
everywhere for you.

1668
02:33:46,329 --> 02:33:48,405
Papa, stop!

1669
02:33:51,126 --> 02:33:54,246
At least listen to me.

1670
02:33:55,088 --> 02:33:57,491
Papa...

1671
02:33:57,595 --> 02:34:01,339
I beg you to accept us.

1672
02:34:07,500 --> 02:34:09,789
Accept them?

1673
02:34:10,837 --> 02:34:13,542
How can I accept them?

1674
02:34:14,882 --> 02:34:18,880
Can I deny everything I believe in?

1675
02:34:20,179 --> 02:34:23,004
On the other hand,

1676
02:34:23,108 --> 02:34:26,717
can I deny my own daughter?

1677
02:34:32,108 --> 02:34:35,554
On the other hand,

1678
02:34:35,658 --> 02:34:39,560
how can I turn my back on my faith,

1679
02:34:39,665 --> 02:34:42,575
my people?

1680
02:34:43,786 --> 02:34:48,858
If I try and bend that far,

1681
02:34:48,962 --> 02:34:51,663
I'll break.

1682
02:34:54,088 --> 02:34:57,208
On the other hand...

1683
02:35:01,220 --> 02:35:06,725
No, there is no other hand.

1684
02:35:07,226 --> 02:35:10,257
- No, Chava! No!
- But, Papa!

1685
02:35:10,361 --> 02:35:13,272
- No! No!
- Papa!

1686
02:35:15,818 --> 02:35:17,894
Papa!

1687
02:35:36,422 --> 02:35:40,035
Golde, here they are.

1688
02:35:40,140 --> 02:35:44,957
The boys I told you about.
Wonderful boys from good families.

1689
02:35:45,061 --> 02:35:49,424
Each of them a prize, a jewel.
You couldn't do better for your girls.

1690
02:35:49,528 --> 02:35:53,426
I don't know, Yente.
My girls are still so young.

1691
02:35:53,530 --> 02:35:56,092
So what do they look like, grandfathers?

1692
02:35:56,196 --> 02:35:58,429
True, the marriage can wait,

1693
02:35:58,533 --> 02:36:03,100
but meanwhile, their future
will be all signed and sealed.

1694
02:36:03,204 --> 02:36:05,519
Which one for which one?

1695
02:36:05,623 --> 02:36:09,525
What's the difference? Take your pick.
They're both wonderful boys.

1696
02:36:09,630 --> 02:36:14,655
Yankel, the fat one,
is apprenticed to a carpenter.

1697
02:36:14,760 --> 02:36:17,532
- I am Yankel.
- Did I ask you?

1698
02:36:17,636 --> 02:36:20,289
Yankel, the skinny one, is...

1699
02:36:20,393 --> 02:36:25,372
- Mama, is Reb Tevye in the house?
- He's in the barn. Is there trouble?

1700
02:36:25,477 --> 02:36:27,678
Stay inside, children.

1701
02:36:29,726 --> 02:36:31,546
What's the matter?

1702
02:36:31,650 --> 02:36:35,257
Tevye, have you seen
the constable lately?

1703
02:36:35,361 --> 02:36:39,302
- No. Why?
- There are some rumours in town.

1704
02:36:39,406 --> 02:36:42,349
We thought, since you knew him so well,

1705
02:36:42,453 --> 02:36:45,522
maybe he told you
what is true and what is not.

1706
02:36:45,626 --> 02:36:48,608
Rumours? What rumours?

1707
02:36:48,712 --> 02:36:51,317
Quiet! Talk, Avram.

1708
02:36:51,421 --> 02:36:56,409
Someone from Zolodin told me
an edict issued in St Petersburg...

1709
02:37:05,011 --> 02:37:09,628
Welcome, Your Honour.
What's the good news in the world?

1710
02:37:09,732 --> 02:37:13,003
I see that you have company.

1711
02:37:13,108 --> 02:37:15,422
They are my friends.

1712
02:37:15,527 --> 02:37:19,815
It's just as well.
What I have to say is for their ears also.

1713
02:37:20,860 --> 02:37:26,144
How much time do you need
to sell your house and household goods?

1714
02:37:26,248 --> 02:37:30,980
Why should I sell my house?
Is it in anybody's way?

1715
02:37:31,084 --> 02:37:34,080
I came to tell you
you have to leave Anatevka.

1716
02:37:35,667 --> 02:37:39,029
How did I come
to deserve such an honour?

1717
02:37:39,134 --> 02:37:41,880
Not just you, of course, but all of you.

1718
02:37:50,014 --> 02:37:54,466
At first, I thought you might be spared
because of your daughter's marriage.

1719
02:37:54,570 --> 02:37:57,840
My daughter is dead.

1720
02:37:57,944 --> 02:38:00,015
I understand.

1721
02:38:01,234 --> 02:38:05,518
At any rate, it affects all of you.
You have to leave.

1722
02:38:05,623 --> 02:38:13,028
But this corner of the world
has always been our home.

1723
02:38:14,205 --> 02:38:17,113
- Why should we leave?
- I don't know why.

1724
02:38:17,218 --> 02:38:21,242
There's trouble in the world.
Troublemakers.

1725
02:38:21,347 --> 02:38:24,451
- Like us?
- You aren't the only ones.

1726
02:38:24,555 --> 02:38:27,706
Your people must leave all
the villages - Zolodin, Rabalevka.

1727
02:38:27,810 --> 02:38:30,922
The entire district must be emptied.

1728
02:38:31,431 --> 02:38:34,550
I have an order here!

1729
02:38:36,185 --> 02:38:40,230
It says that you must sell your homes
and be out of here in three days.

1730
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:54,230
And you?

1731
02:38:54,334 --> 02:38:59,861
You, who have known us all your life,
you'd carry out this order?

1732
02:38:59,965 --> 02:39:02,618
I've nothing to do with it.
Don't you understand?

1733
02:39:02,722 --> 02:39:06,574
I wish you wouldn't say me.

1734
02:39:06,678 --> 02:39:10,830
- I understand.
- Suppose we refuse to go?

1735
02:39:10,935 --> 02:39:14,291
- You will be forced out.
- We will defend ourselves.

1736
02:39:14,396 --> 02:39:18,547
- We'll stay in our homes.
- We will keep our land and fight.

1737
02:39:18,651 --> 02:39:22,301
Against our militia, our army?
I wouldn't advise that.

1738
02:39:22,406 --> 02:39:25,850
I have some advice for you.

1739
02:39:27,028 --> 02:39:29,891
Get off my land.

1740
02:39:29,995 --> 02:39:35,228
This is still my home, my land.

1741
02:39:35,332 --> 02:39:38,448
Get off my land.

1742
02:39:46,881 --> 02:39:50,001
You have three days.

1743
02:40:00,812 --> 02:40:03,010
After a lifetime,

1744
02:40:03,114 --> 02:40:06,097
a piece of paper, and get thee out.

1745
02:40:06,201 --> 02:40:08,851
We should unite
with the people of Zolodin.

1746
02:40:08,955 --> 02:40:12,142
- Maybe they have a plan.
- We should defend ourselves.

1747
02:40:12,246 --> 02:40:15,853
- An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
- Very good

1748
02:40:15,957 --> 02:40:19,398
That way the whole world
will be blind and toothless.

1749
02:40:19,502 --> 02:40:25,574
Rabbi, we've been waiting
for the Messiah all our lives.

1750
02:40:25,678 --> 02:40:28,505
Wouldn't this be
a good time for him to come?

1751
02:40:32,385 --> 02:40:37,177
We'll have to wait for him someplace else.

1752
02:40:41,394 --> 02:40:45,344
Meanwhile, let's start packing.

1753
02:41:04,208 --> 02:41:09,908
Well, Anatevka hasn't exactly been
the Garden of Eden.

1754
02:41:10,012 --> 02:41:11,870
That's true.

1755
02:41:11,975 --> 02:41:15,329
After all, what have we got here?

1756
02:41:15,433 --> 02:41:20,334
<i>~ A little bit of this, a little bit of that ~</i>

1757
02:41:20,438 --> 02:41:22,835
<i>~ A pot</i>
<i>A pan ~</i>

1758
02:41:22,940 --> 02:41:25,966
<i>~ A broom</i>
<i>A hat ~</i>

1759
02:41:26,070 --> 02:41:31,641
<i>~ Someone should have set a match</i>
<i>to this place years ago ~</i>

1760
02:41:31,745 --> 02:41:33,767
<i>~ A bench</i>
<i>A tree ~</i>

1761
02:41:33,871 --> 02:41:36,643
<i>~ What's a house?</i>
<i>Or a stove? ~</i>

1762
02:41:36,747 --> 02:41:41,774
People who pass through Anatevka
don't even know they've been here.

1763
02:41:41,878 --> 02:41:46,405
<i>~ A stick of wood</i>
<i>A piece of cloth ~</i>

1764
02:41:46,509 --> 02:41:48,903
<i>~ What do we leave? ~</i>

1765
02:41:49,007 --> 02:41:51,494
<i>~ Nothing much ~</i>

1766
02:41:51,714 --> 02:41:54,964
<i>~ Only Anatevka ~</i>

1767
02:41:57,679 --> 02:42:00,081
<i>~ Anatevka ~</i>

1768
02:42:00,185 --> 02:42:02,583
<i>~ Anatevka ~</i>

1769
02:42:02,688 --> 02:42:08,383
<i>~ Underfed, overworked Anatevka ~</i>

1770
02:42:08,487 --> 02:42:15,480
<i>~ Where else would Sabbath be so sweet? ~</i>

1771
02:42:18,283 --> 02:42:20,730
<i>~ Anatevka ~</i>

1772
02:42:20,834 --> 02:42:23,107
<i>~ Anatevka ~</i>

1773
02:42:23,211 --> 02:42:28,653
<i>~ Intimate, obstinate Anatevka ~</i>

1774
02:42:28,758 --> 02:42:35,501
<i>~ Where I know everyone I meet ~</i>

1775
02:42:38,219 --> 02:42:48,258
<i>~ Soon I'll be a stranger</i>
<i>in a strange new place ~</i>

1776
02:42:48,363 --> 02:42:55,430
<i>~ Searching for an old familiar face ~</i>

1777
02:42:55,534 --> 02:42:59,692
<i>~ From Anatevka ~</i>

1778
02:43:20,553 --> 02:43:25,420
<i>~ I belong to Anatevka ~</i>

1779
02:43:25,525 --> 02:43:31,094
<i>~ Tumbledown, workaday Anatevka ~</i>

1780
02:43:31,198 --> 02:43:34,430
<i>~ Dear little village ~</i>

1781
02:43:34,534 --> 02:43:44,407
<i>~ Little town of mine ~</i>

1782
02:44:04,138 --> 02:44:06,170
It's just a place.

1783
02:44:06,274 --> 02:44:12,381
Our forefathers have been forced out of
many, many places at a moment's notice.

1784
02:44:12,485 --> 02:44:18,601
Maybe that's why
we always wear our hats.

1785
02:46:10,848 --> 02:46:12,502
Golde!

1786
02:46:12,606 --> 02:46:14,254
Golde, darling.

1787
02:46:14,358 --> 02:46:18,636
I had to see you before I left
because I have such news for you.

1788
02:46:18,741 --> 02:46:24,476
Remember, yesterday I didn't know where
to go, what to do with these old bones.

1789
02:46:24,580 --> 02:46:27,767
Now I know.
You want to hear? I'll tell you.

1790
02:46:27,872 --> 02:46:31,644
All my life,
I've dreamed of going to one place.

1791
02:46:31,748 --> 02:46:34,691
Guess where?
Nah, you'll never guess.

1792
02:46:34,795 --> 02:46:38,113
Every year at Passover, what do we say?

1793
02:46:38,217 --> 02:46:43,242
Next year in Jerusalem.
Next year in the Holy Land.

1794
02:46:43,347 --> 02:46:46,869
- You're going to the Holy Land?
- You guessed.

1795
02:46:46,973 --> 02:46:49,332
Goodbye, Yente.

1796
02:46:49,436 --> 02:46:54,046
Be well and go in peace.

1797
02:46:54,150 --> 02:46:56,128
And so, goodbye, Golde.

1798
02:46:56,232 --> 02:46:59,923
Sometime, maybe we'll meet
on a happier occasion.

1799
02:47:00,027 --> 02:47:03,263
Meanwhile, we suffer. Oh, we suffer.

1800
02:47:03,368 --> 02:47:06,850
We suffer in silence, right?
Of course, right.

1801
02:47:06,955 --> 02:47:11,896
Where are you going?
You don't know where you're going?

1802
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:16,777
- Come, Golde, we have to leave.
- Leave. It sounds so easy.

1803
02:47:16,881 --> 02:47:20,568
Golde, we'll all be together soon.

1804
02:47:20,672 --> 02:47:23,782
Motel, Tzeitel and the baby,
they'll come too, you'll see.

1805
02:47:23,886 --> 02:47:25,950
This Motel is a person.

1806
02:47:26,054 --> 02:47:29,705
And Hodel and Perchik?
When will we ever see them again?

1807
02:47:29,810 --> 02:47:33,377
Do they come visiting us
from Siberia every Sabbath?

1808
02:47:33,481 --> 02:47:38,840
You know what she writes.
He sits in prison, she works.

1809
02:47:38,944 --> 02:47:45,219
But soon he'll be set free and together
they'll turn the world upside down.

1810
02:47:45,323 --> 02:47:50,979
She couldn't be happier,
and the other children will be with us.

1811
02:47:51,083 --> 02:47:53,150
Not all.

1812
02:47:54,494 --> 02:47:56,570
All.

1813
02:48:02,293 --> 02:48:04,158
Come, Golde.

1814
02:48:04,262 --> 02:48:07,744
I have to clean up, sweep the floor.

1815
02:48:07,849 --> 02:48:12,549
- Sweep the floor?
- I don't want to leave a dirty house.

1816
02:48:16,474 --> 02:48:18,348
Tevye.

1817
02:48:19,936 --> 02:48:24,426
Tevye, I am on my way.

1818
02:48:24,530 --> 02:48:27,229
Where are you going?

1819
02:48:28,278 --> 02:48:30,763
Chicago, in America.

1820
02:48:30,868 --> 02:48:33,227
Chicago, America?

1821
02:48:33,332 --> 02:48:36,648
We are going to New York, America.

1822
02:48:36,753 --> 02:48:39,108
We'll be neighbours.

1823
02:48:39,212 --> 02:48:42,113
My wife, Fruma Sarah,
has a brother there.

1824
02:48:42,218 --> 02:48:45,821
- That's nice.
- I hate him!

1825
02:48:45,925 --> 02:48:51,259
But a relative is a relative.

1826
02:48:52,719 --> 02:48:55,838
- Goodbye, Tevye.
- Goodbye, Lazar Wolf.

1827
02:49:59,600 --> 02:50:03,763
Well, my old friends,
it's time to say goodbye.

1828
02:50:10,152 --> 02:50:13,106
The farmer Bushenko
will be coming for you later.

1829
02:50:14,365 --> 02:50:16,690
He's not a bad sort.

1830
02:50:17,826 --> 02:50:22,120
If you are good to him,
he'll be good to you.

1831
02:50:24,541 --> 02:50:28,160
Take care of your leg, huh?

1832
02:50:38,847 --> 02:50:41,219
Thanks for everything.

1833
02:50:56,782 --> 02:50:58,858
Chava!

1834
02:51:04,748 --> 02:51:06,901
- Papa will see you.
- I want him to.

1835
02:51:07,006 --> 02:51:10,824
I want to say goodbye to him.

1836
02:51:10,928 --> 02:51:13,996
- He won't listen to you.
- But at least he will hear.

1837
02:51:14,100 --> 02:51:17,376
Maybe it would be better if I told Mama.

1838
02:51:19,430 --> 02:51:21,506
Chaveleh!

1839
02:51:37,573 --> 02:51:39,649
Papa.

1840
02:51:54,339 --> 02:51:56,416
Papa.

1841
02:51:58,969 --> 02:52:01,092
We came to say goodbye.

1842
02:52:06,393 --> 02:52:09,596
We are also leaving this place.

1843
02:52:10,939 --> 02:52:13,009
We are going to Cracow.

1844
02:52:13,113 --> 02:52:19,063
We cannot stay among people
who can do such things to others.

1845
02:52:20,908 --> 02:52:24,490
We wanted you to know that.

1846
02:52:36,632 --> 02:52:39,911
Some are driven away by edicts,

1847
02:52:40,015 --> 02:52:42,964
others by silence.

1848
02:52:52,689 --> 02:52:55,394
Goodbye, Papa.

1849
02:52:57,027 --> 02:52:59,103
Mama.

1850
02:53:02,074 --> 02:53:04,150
Come, Chava.

1851
02:53:20,217 --> 02:53:22,625
Goodbye, Chava... Fyedka.

1852
02:53:27,307 --> 02:53:29,715
And God be with you.

1853
02:53:38,110 --> 02:53:42,682
- And God be with you.
- We will write to you in America.

02:53:42,786 --> 02:53:45,479
We will be staying with Uncle Avram!

1855
02:53:45,583 --> 02:53:47,652
Yes, Mama.

1856
02:53:58,063 --> 02:54:02,470
"We'll be staying with Uncle Avram?"
"We'll be staying with Uncle Avram?"

1857
02:54:02,574 --> 02:54:05,808
The whole world
has to know our business.

1858
02:54:05,913 --> 02:54:11,021
Stop yelling and finish packing.
We have a long way to go.

1859
02:54:11,125 --> 02:54:14,647
Golde, I don't need your advice.

1860
02:54:14,752 --> 02:54:17,866
Tzeitel, don't forget the baby.

1861
02:54:35,267 --> 02:54:37,343
Goodbye, Papa.

1862
02:54:46,278 --> 02:54:48,937
Work hard, Motel,

1863
02:54:49,041 --> 02:54:51,939
and come to us soon.

1864
02:54:52,043 --> 02:54:54,441
I will, Papa.

1865
02:54:55,579 --> 02:54:58,450
I'll work hard.

1866
02:55:34,451 --> 02:55:36,527
All right, children.

1867
02:55:39,206 --> 02:55:41,282
Let's go.
