1
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:25,842
<i>There were
probably no two people</i>

2
00:00:25,843 --> 00:00:27,552
<i>on this earth more opposite
than each other</i>

3
00:00:27,553 --> 00:00:30,013
<i>than myself and Billy Jack,</i>

4
00:00:30,014 --> 00:00:32,015
<i>and now that I look back on it,</i>

5
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:33,850
<i>it's hard to believe
that the chain of events</i>

6
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:36,770
<i>that that would first
bring us so close</i>

7
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:40,357
<i>and then end up in so much
tragedy in bloodshed</i>

8
00:00:40,358 --> 00:00:42,943
<i>could begin with an early
Saturday morning drive</i>

9
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:45,446
<i>by Sheriff Cole over
to his deputy's house.</i>

10
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,119
Morning, Cole.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,204
What brings you out this hour?

12
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:55,205
They found your daughter.

13
00:00:59,127 --> 00:01:01,337
Where? Haight-Ashbury again?

14
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,381
Yeah.

15
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:05,465
They're flying her in
to Phoenix.

16
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,427
You want to take my car
and go down and get her?

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,761
When?

18
00:01:08,928 --> 00:01:09,928
Now.

19
00:01:10,013 --> 00:01:11,389
I can't, damn it.

20
00:01:11,597 --> 00:01:12,889
Posner just called and told me

21
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:14,725
to be out at Box Canyon
in half an hour.

22
00:01:14,726 --> 00:01:17,060
It's illegal for anyone
to hunt wild mustang, Mike.

23
00:01:17,061 --> 00:01:19,229
Especially a deputy sheriff.
You know that.

24
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:21,982
I know. I also know that when
Posner says jump a lot of

25
00:01:21,983 --> 00:01:24,527
people in this town have to
jump, including me.

26
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,071
What do you want to do about
Barbara?

27
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:33,619
Look, Cole I'll try to get back
before she gets here.

28
00:01:36,914 --> 00:01:38,041
Hey, Mike?

29
00:01:40,376 --> 00:01:41,376
Yeah?

30
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:43,045
How much is the dog
food company paying

31
00:01:43,046 --> 00:01:44,380
for mustang meat now?

32
00:01:46,424 --> 00:01:48,301
Six cents a pound. Why?

33
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:49,510
Nothing.

34
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:52,221
I was wondering if Barbara
would think it's worth it.

35
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,177
Get the gate!

36
00:05:14,423 --> 00:05:16,883
You like the first
shot, Mr. Posner?

37
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,887
Thanks, Mike.
I'll let Bernard have that.

38
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,691
Come on now, Bernard.

39
00:05:32,692 --> 00:05:34,944
Get your ass out of that truck.

40
00:05:35,361 --> 00:05:36,946
Get up there and start shootin'.

41
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:40,907
Please, Dad.
You know I can't shoot.

42
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,702
I said now!

43
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:55,088
Shoot!

44
00:06:01,429 --> 00:06:02,722
Shoot, damn you!

45
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:05,975
I can't.

46
00:06:11,314 --> 00:06:13,356
All right, Mike. Start shootin'.

47
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,867
I knew he'd find us.

48
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:21,050
Morning, Billy.

49
00:07:21,384 --> 00:07:23,719
You're illegally on Indian land.

50
00:07:25,137 --> 00:07:27,056
I'm sorry about that.

51
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:30,433
I guess we just got caught up
in the chase and

52
00:07:30,434 --> 00:07:32,520
crossed over without knowing it.

53
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:36,273
You're a liar.

54
00:07:41,278 --> 00:07:43,072
We got the law here, Billy Jack.

55
00:07:43,614 --> 00:07:47,034
When policemen break the law
then there isn't any law.

56
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:49,412
Just a fight for survival.

57
00:07:49,578 --> 00:07:51,455
Mr. Posner, I got no authority

58
00:07:51,622 --> 00:07:53,040
on a federal Indian reservation.

59
00:07:57,253 --> 00:07:58,629
Drop it or die.

60
00:08:02,758 --> 00:08:04,718
On this reservation
I am the law,

61
00:08:05,553 --> 00:08:07,304
so I'll tell you this just once.

62
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,599
Have your men drop their guns
and you can leave quietly.

63
00:08:12,309 --> 00:08:14,060
You're making a mistake.

64
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,521
I've made 'em before.

65
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,023
We got him
outnumbered, Mr. Posner.

66
00:08:19,483 --> 00:08:20,859
You know me, Posner.

67
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,236
And you know my meaning.

68
00:08:26,365 --> 00:08:27,574
Drop 'em.

69
00:08:32,288 --> 00:08:34,372
<i>All the townspeople knew about.</i>

70
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:36,040
<i>Billy Jack was that he was</i>

71
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:39,545
<i>a half-breed, a war hero who
hated the war and turned his</i>

72
00:08:39,712 --> 00:08:42,755
<i>back on society by returning
to the reservation,</i>

73
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:45,842
<i>where he watched over the
Indians, the wild horses,</i>

74
00:08:45,843 --> 00:08:47,803
<i>and the kids at my school.</i>

75
00:08:48,429 --> 00:08:50,472
<i>No one even knew where he lived.</i>

76
00:08:50,473 --> 00:08:54,684
<i>Somewhere way back in ancient
ruins with an old holy man who</i>

77
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:56,561
<i>who was teaching him secret
Indian ways</i>

78
00:08:56,562 --> 00:08:59,565
<i>and preparing him for a sacred
initiation ceremony.</i>

79
00:09:09,033 --> 00:09:10,326
Hiya, sweetie...

80
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,889
My first instinct is
to beat the hell out of you.

81
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:33,265
You know that, don't you?

82
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,020
But it probably wouldn't do
any good, now would it?

83
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:41,357
I bet you're hungry.

84
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:44,150
Can I fix you something
to eat, Barb?

85
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:45,902
How long since you last eaten?

86
00:09:45,903 --> 00:09:47,320
Two days.

87
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:49,656
Two days?

88
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:51,200
No wonder you don't look well.

89
00:09:52,243 --> 00:09:54,869
I don't look well because
I've got hepatitis

90
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,456
and a goddamn abscessed
tooth that's killing me.

91
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,082
Well, let's call a doctor.

92
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:00,416
You can't call the doctor.

93
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:01,668
He'll make me stay
in the hospital.

94
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:04,003
I know, but that's the only
way to cure hepatitis.

95
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,798
Not because of hepatitis,
because of the baby.

96
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,132
What baby?

97
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:09,676
The it baby. I'm pregnant.

98
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:10,760
You're what?

99
00:10:10,761 --> 00:10:11,887
Pregnant.

100
00:10:17,476 --> 00:10:19,061
I've been expecting this.

101
00:10:20,145 --> 00:10:21,188
How long?

102
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,233
Maybe six weeks.

103
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:33,032
All right.

104
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,368
Where's the father?

105
00:10:34,827 --> 00:10:36,369
Where's the father?
That's funny.

106
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,163
I don't even know
who the father is.

107
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,252
What's that supposed to mean?

108
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:46,504
It means, concerned father,
that I was passed around

109
00:10:46,505 --> 00:10:48,881
by so many of those
phony Maharishi types

110
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:51,342
who kept telling me
love is beautiful

111
00:10:51,343 --> 00:10:52,803
and all that bullshit.

112
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,889
In other words,
concerned father,

113
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,890
I got balled by so many guys,

114
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,017
I don't know if the father

115
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:04,398
is going to be white,
Indian, Mexican, or black.

116
00:11:30,215 --> 00:11:31,300
Hey.

117
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,259
Hey, miss.

118
00:11:34,428 --> 00:11:35,721
Hey, come on, wake up.

119
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:41,852
Well, she's a pretty sick girl,

120
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:44,562
but nothing a lot
of bed rest won't cure.

121
00:11:44,563 --> 00:11:46,643
The question now is what
are we going to do with her?

122
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:48,814
Another beating like that
and she'll lose that baby.

123
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:50,943
May be the best thing
that could happen to her.

124
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:52,404
- Cole!
- All right, all right.

125
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:55,574
Billy, anyone
see you bring her in here?

126
00:11:56,909 --> 00:11:58,702
Why? What do you have in mind?

127
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,705
Well we can't take her home,
and Posner would protect her

128
00:12:01,872 --> 00:12:03,272
father against anything we
could do.

129
00:12:03,415 --> 00:12:05,501
We sure can't hide her
anywhere around town,

130
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:07,001
so...

131
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,421
So you want to hide her out
at the school?

132
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:12,299
Yeah. At least until
she gets well.

133
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:14,593
I ain't going to no damn school.

134
00:12:18,097 --> 00:12:20,223
Well, it's either that
or go back to your father.

135
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:21,724
Besides, this isn't
an ordinary school.

136
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:24,811
It's a very progressive
school out on the reservation

137
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:26,438
run by a very remarkable woman.

138
00:12:26,647 --> 00:12:27,856
You'll like her.

139
00:12:28,524 --> 00:12:30,359
Person hasn't been born
I'd like.

140
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:32,068
What is her father going to do

141
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:33,445
when he finds out
she's out there?

142
00:12:33,904 --> 00:12:34,988
He thinks she ran away.

143
00:12:35,531 --> 00:12:37,950
Nobody here is going to
tell him any different.

144
00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:40,119
Too narrow!

145
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:41,995
Come in much wider!

146
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:52,422
If you want to win, Kit, you've
gotta do better than 18 seconds!

147
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:54,173
Gee, I just can't seem
to get close enough.

148
00:12:54,174 --> 00:12:55,467
Could you show me again?

149
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:04,183
What are they doing?

150
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:07,020
Probably teaching some of
the kids how to barrel race.

151
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,609
Anything any kid wants to learn,

152
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,930
they try to teach it
to them here.

153
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,239
I told you this was a
different kind of school.

154
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:20,825
<i>When I took over this school</i>

155
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:23,662
<i>out here at the reservation,
I knew here would be trouble.</i>

156
00:13:24,538 --> 00:13:27,623
<i>First because I opened it up
to any kid with a problem...</i>

157
00:13:27,624 --> 00:13:30,501
<i>Black, white, Indian, Chicano...</i>

158
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:33,504
<i>Who could come any time they
wanted, stay as long as they</i>

159
00:13:33,505 --> 00:13:35,256
<i>wanted and leave
when they wanted.</i>

160
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:36,633
<i>No questions asked.</i>

161
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:39,886
<i>Then people became
even more hostile</i>

162
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,181
<i>when I announced that there
would only be three rules.</i>

163
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:45,808
<i>No drugs, everyone had
to carry his own load,</i>

164
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:48,353
<i>and everyone had to get turned
on by creating something,</i>

165
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,396
<i>anything.</i>

166
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,274
<i>Whether it be weaving a blanket,</i>

167
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:55,986
<i>making a film,</i>

168
00:13:57,404 --> 00:13:58,655
<i>or doing a painting.</i>

169
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,240
<i>Preferably something
that made one proud</i>

170
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:03,160
<i>of one's own heritage and past.</i>

171
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,082
<i>Or by getting involved
in such strange things</i>

172
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:10,667
<i>as yoga meditation.</i>

173
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:13,295
Keep your eyes
focused on the third eye point.

174
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:17,256
Or psychodrama and role playing,

175
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,802
things that the townspeople
could never understand.

176
00:14:31,063 --> 00:14:33,231
You guys are my last chance.

177
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:35,358
Do you think you can
do anything with her?

178
00:14:35,359 --> 00:14:36,859
Sure.

179
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,528
Sure. Okay. No problem.

180
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:40,571
Hold it for just a minute, okay?

181
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,035
Everybody, this is Barbara.

182
00:14:46,036 --> 00:14:48,996
She's going to be working
with us for a while, and

183
00:14:48,997 --> 00:14:51,707
instead of going through a lot
of introduction, why don't we

184
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:55,044
just get to know each other
by getting into another scene?

185
00:14:55,045 --> 00:14:56,754
Why don't we do one of
those role-playing things,

186
00:14:56,755 --> 00:14:57,922
where we send her out the room

187
00:14:57,923 --> 00:15:00,216
and then she has to come back
and figure out who we are.

188
00:15:00,217 --> 00:15:01,300
Good Idea.

189
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:03,928
And all you have to do
is come into the scene

190
00:15:03,929 --> 00:15:06,849
and discover who you are
as the scene progresses.

191
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:08,099
I can't.

192
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,226
Why not?

193
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:12,770
The reason I'm here is
because I'm knocked up.

194
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:14,939
Congratulations.

195
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,732
Okay well just do it about her

196
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:17,900
being pregnant, that's all.

197
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:19,069
Great!

198
00:15:21,613 --> 00:15:23,240
All right,
then let's get it together.

199
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:26,785
I got a good one.

200
00:15:26,952 --> 00:15:29,246
How 'bout if the world
is really messed up,

201
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:30,997
and it really needs
a new savior,

202
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:32,398
and she's going to give
birth to it.

203
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,417
Agreeing.

204
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:37,169
Okay. Let's rap it out.
What happens?

205
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,588
Okay, a virgin birth.

206
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:42,592
Okay, a virgin birth.

207
00:15:42,593 --> 00:15:44,219
But this is
going to be a modern one,

208
00:15:44,386 --> 00:15:47,263
it won't have to be,
like, the old kind.

209
00:15:47,264 --> 00:15:48,974
Okay, let's do it.

210
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:52,643
Let's get in aisles.

211
00:15:52,644 --> 00:15:53,979
I'm going to be the Savior...

212
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:08,827
What are you doing?

213
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,626
That's beautiful...
a black Jesus...

214
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,880
so they should crucify Him,

215
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:24,550
and then the rest of us say
give us a sign before you

216
00:16:24,551 --> 00:16:27,136
die, or give us the answer,
or something before you die

217
00:16:27,137 --> 00:16:28,888
because He's dying on the cross,

218
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:31,307
and that's when He gives us
the sign.

219
00:16:31,308 --> 00:16:32,975
What's the sign of the
new religion

220
00:16:32,976 --> 00:16:34,894
so people will know each other?

221
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,160
Carol wrote a new
song about her brother,

222
00:16:51,161 --> 00:16:52,662
but she's too bashful
to sing it.

223
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:54,205
Will you go up
and sing it for us?

224
00:16:54,206 --> 00:16:55,581
I don't want to.

225
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,083
Come on. Don't be so bashful,

226
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,209
you sing so well.

227
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:06,969
What's her trip?

228
00:17:07,219 --> 00:17:08,804
She's really out of it.

229
00:17:09,054 --> 00:17:10,614
She wears three pairs
of false eyelashes

230
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:13,100
and thinks the world
is Hollywood in the 1940s.

231
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:14,517
She's just not quite right.

232
00:17:14,518 --> 00:17:16,318
I guess she doesn't
have any place else to go.

233
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:20,106
This whole idea of doing
your thing in the mess hall

234
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,651
came from a visit somebody made
to a Benedictine monastery.

235
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,610
And anybody who wants
to read or sing

236
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,651
or just do anything at all
just gets up and does it.

237
00:17:26,863 --> 00:17:29,241
Carol has written us a new
song about her brother.

238
00:17:29,408 --> 00:17:30,533
Two of 'em.

239
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:33,578
I beg your pardon,
two of them. Go ahead.

240
00:19:29,361 --> 00:19:31,153
When you go through
that ceremony to become a

241
00:19:31,154 --> 00:19:33,435
brother to the snake, do you
let the rattlesnake bite you?

242
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:36,493
Over and over?

243
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:39,995
Could I be your apprentice

244
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:41,540
and help during
the purification part?

245
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:46,419
In order to be an apprentice
you have to be able to...

246
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:48,838
strip yourself of your greed
and and your ego trips

247
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:51,049
in order to let the spirit
enter into you.

248
00:19:51,508 --> 00:19:53,050
My grandmother is a Kachina.

249
00:19:53,051 --> 00:19:54,635
They say the spider woman came

250
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:55,956
and worked through my
grandfather.

251
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:57,681
He was a medicine man.

252
00:20:01,518 --> 00:20:02,894
You believe in the spirit?

253
00:20:03,103 --> 00:20:04,353
One night when I was a boy,

254
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:06,481
one came and left the bow
arrows on my bed.

255
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:11,153
Most people think
that's a bunch of crap.

256
00:20:11,653 --> 00:20:12,653
I don't.

257
00:21:08,793 --> 00:21:10,378
What are you so worried about?

258
00:21:10,921 --> 00:21:12,881
About the kids going
into town tomorrow.

259
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:15,428
Why don't you just tell them
that they can't go?

260
00:21:15,634 --> 00:21:17,676
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

261
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:19,655
Because they have to make
their own decisions here,

262
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,847
you know that.

263
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:26,811
Do they love each other?

264
00:21:30,273 --> 00:21:31,566
Nobody knows.

265
00:22:03,265 --> 00:22:04,723
It's funny, isn't it?

266
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:07,018
How everybody in town is
afraid of you.

267
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,396
But I guess it's a good thing
they are,

268
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:11,897
because if they weren't,
they'd hurt the school

269
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:13,566
a lot more than they do now.

270
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:18,571
It's an awfully lonely life,
though, isn't it?

271
00:22:21,116 --> 00:22:22,908
What's going to happen tomorrow
is going to happen,

272
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,910
and all your worry in the world

273
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:26,454
isn't going
to change that, okay?

274
00:22:26,705 --> 00:22:29,332
Come on, smile. Okay.

275
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,375
Right.

276
00:23:30,685 --> 00:23:32,728
Hey, Cole, when are you
going to do something

277
00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:34,605
about those long-haired
weirdoes?

278
00:23:34,606 --> 00:23:36,982
Before or after they start
to burn their draft cards?

279
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:38,401
He's waiting till
some of our kids

280
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:40,819
start going out there
and smoking, ain't you, Cole?

281
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,821
Nope.

282
00:23:41,988 --> 00:23:43,238
As soon as I finished my shine,

283
00:23:43,239 --> 00:23:44,967
I'm going outside and shoot
three or four of them,

284
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:46,284
show 'em who's boss.

285
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:49,204
Wow! Is that nice!

286
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:53,166
Wow! Is that nice!

287
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,044
Was that class?
Or was that class!

288
00:23:58,088 --> 00:23:59,421
I've seen better.

289
00:23:59,422 --> 00:24:01,006
Mr. Stud, himself.

290
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:02,884
He could pick up that chick
just like that.

291
00:24:03,051 --> 00:24:04,259
Couldn't ya, Bernard?

292
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,386
Are you kidding!

293
00:24:05,387 --> 00:24:07,389
Of course he could handle her,
can't you, Bernard?

294
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:10,225
Just put up the money.

295
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,311
Like, say, 50 bucks.

296
00:24:17,732 --> 00:24:19,400
Covered.

297
00:24:28,952 --> 00:24:32,122
Howdy. My name is
Bernard Posner.

298
00:24:32,372 --> 00:24:33,540
Really?

299
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:35,708
Really.

300
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:38,670
Is that supposed
to mean something?

301
00:24:39,671 --> 00:24:42,257
Around these parts, you hear
the name Posner quite a bit.

302
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,133
That's very interesting.

303
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:45,654
You know, you hear
my name quite a bit,

304
00:24:45,844 --> 00:24:47,886
Not just around here, either.

305
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:49,556
No fooling. What's your name?

306
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:51,473
Up...

307
00:24:51,474 --> 00:24:54,936
Up. That's an odd name.

308
00:24:55,687 --> 00:24:56,896
What's your last name?

309
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,565
Yours.

310
00:25:01,526 --> 00:25:02,861
Up yours!

311
00:25:11,536 --> 00:25:13,246
Hey, why isn't
everybody going in?

312
00:25:13,538 --> 00:25:14,830
They're afraid to go in.

313
00:25:14,831 --> 00:25:15,998
Why?

314
00:25:15,999 --> 00:25:17,791
Indians aren't allowed
in some of the stores here.

315
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:19,793
What do you mean, not allowed?
I don't see a sign.

316
00:25:19,794 --> 00:25:20,961
Indians don't need a sign.

317
00:25:20,962 --> 00:25:22,838
They know damn well
when they're not wanted.

318
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:24,465
Then why you going in?

319
00:25:24,466 --> 00:25:25,884
'Cause I like ice cream.

320
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:29,428
Here you go.

321
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:30,430
Thank you.

322
00:25:41,858 --> 00:25:43,526
Could we have
some ice cream, please?

323
00:25:53,077 --> 00:25:56,039
Look we'd like to buy some
ice-cream cones. Please!

324
00:25:57,415 --> 00:25:59,459
Sorry, I'm all out of cones.

325
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:01,628
You just sold to the
kid ahead of us.

326
00:26:03,671 --> 00:26:05,507
Look, I told you.
I'm all out of cones.

327
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:12,597
You're a liar.

328
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,727
You're a smart little
punk, aren't you?

329
00:26:17,936 --> 00:26:19,394
Hey, hold it, hold it!

330
00:26:19,395 --> 00:26:20,646
Come on, you guys.

331
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:22,898
There's no need for
all this violence.

332
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:24,900
It's a simple problem, really.

333
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:27,986
Harry look, I know you worked
hard to own your own store

334
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:30,197
and you feel you should
have a right

335
00:26:30,198 --> 00:26:32,157
to serve whoever you
want to, right?

336
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:34,035
- Right!
- Okay.

337
00:26:34,786 --> 00:26:37,829
While little Miss Up Yours here
feels if she wants you to serve

338
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,665
her non-white friends,

339
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,833
you damn well better serve
her non-white friends.

340
00:26:41,834 --> 00:26:44,379
That doesn't sound like an
insurmountable problem.

341
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:48,174
Hey Dinosaur, bring me some of
that flour over there.

342
00:26:55,139 --> 00:26:57,099
Simple solution
is simply to make.

343
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:59,185
Miss Up Yours
non-white friends...

344
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,354
white.

345
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:04,691
All right, all right.

346
00:27:09,445 --> 00:27:10,612
What's the matter, boy,

347
00:27:10,613 --> 00:27:12,282
you gonna let the women
do your fighting?

348
00:27:13,116 --> 00:27:14,659
Come on. Let's get out of here.

349
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:17,954
You know, I'm always suspicious
of you pacifist types,

350
00:27:18,496 --> 00:27:20,582
that it's just a fancy way
of covering up

351
00:27:20,748 --> 00:27:21,873
that you're yellow.

352
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:24,669
Please this won't accomplish
anything. We'll just leave.

353
00:27:24,961 --> 00:27:29,924
No. Our good deeds not done!
As for the little one here...

354
00:27:30,091 --> 00:27:31,134
Hey!

355
00:27:32,594 --> 00:27:33,720
Stop it!

356
00:27:57,619 --> 00:28:00,829
There. Now everybody is white.

357
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,665
So Harry, why don't you serve

358
00:28:02,832 --> 00:28:05,126
all our friends
an ice-cream cone?

359
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:16,638
Remember,
before you try anything,

360
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:19,807
you're in our territory now!

361
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:22,226
With the sheriff nearby!

362
00:28:25,688 --> 00:28:27,649
Bernard, the Sheriff is out
at the school.

363
00:28:32,028 --> 00:28:33,446
Go get my dad.

364
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,158
And have someone
get the Sheriff!

365
00:28:56,094 --> 00:28:57,136
Bernard,

366
00:29:00,682 --> 00:29:01,891
I want you to know

367
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,144
that I try.

368
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:09,481
When Jean and the kids at the
school tell me

369
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:11,441
that I'm supposed
to control my violent

370
00:29:11,442 --> 00:29:16,280
temper and be passive and
non-violent like they are,

371
00:29:20,076 --> 00:29:22,412
I try. I really try.

372
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:30,420
But when I see this girl...

373
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:34,632
of such a beautiful spirit

374
00:29:35,675 --> 00:29:36,884
so degraded...

375
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:41,973
and when I see this boy
that I love...

376
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,770
sprawled out by this big
ape, here.

377
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:57,195
And this little girl
who is so special to us

378
00:29:57,196 --> 00:30:00,074
that we call her God's
little gift of sunshine.

379
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,833
And I think
of the number of years

380
00:30:09,834 --> 00:30:12,128
she's gonna have to carry
in her memory

381
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:20,261
the savagery of this idiotic
moment of yours...

382
00:30:24,348 --> 00:30:25,975
I just go...

383
00:30:26,142 --> 00:30:27,935
berserk!

384
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:44,410
You hurt?

385
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:45,745
Get in your eyes?

386
00:30:46,954 --> 00:30:49,290
A lot of stupid people in this
world, aren't there?

387
00:30:52,543 --> 00:30:57,131
Sure you're all right?
How come you don't smile?

388
00:30:58,216 --> 00:30:59,634
You do look kind of funny.

389
00:30:59,801 --> 00:31:01,401
You better go.
They're going to kill you.

390
00:31:02,762 --> 00:31:03,971
You okay? Okay.

391
00:31:18,861 --> 00:31:20,238
Don't go out there.

392
00:31:21,155 --> 00:31:22,782
Nobody in town is
going to help you.

393
00:31:28,371 --> 00:31:29,664
Please don't go out there.

394
00:32:34,896 --> 00:32:36,105
Big Indian chief.

395
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:38,858
So special. So above the law.

396
00:32:39,442 --> 00:32:41,694
You think you can do
just as you please.

397
00:32:42,862 --> 00:32:45,615
I told you you'd make a
mistake and I'd be waiting.

398
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,450
Watch his feet, man.
He can kill you with his feet.

399
00:32:48,451 --> 00:32:50,620
He can do anything he
wants with his feet.

400
00:32:52,371 --> 00:32:54,372
Do you really think those green
beret karate tricks

401
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:56,133
are going to help you
against all these boys?

402
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:01,004
Well, it doesn't look like to me

403
00:33:01,005 --> 00:33:02,882
like I really have
any choice, now does it?

404
00:33:04,634 --> 00:33:06,218
That's right. You don't.

405
00:33:07,303 --> 00:33:09,137
You know what I think
I'm going to do, then,

406
00:33:09,138 --> 00:33:10,181
just for the hell of it?

407
00:33:10,973 --> 00:33:12,099
Tell me.

408
00:33:12,433 --> 00:33:14,352
I'm going to take
this right foot...

409
00:33:16,854 --> 00:33:20,399
and I'm going to wop you
on that side of your face.

410
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,860
And you want to know something?

411
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:25,403
There's not a damn thing

412
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:27,073
you're going to be able
to do about it.

413
00:33:28,699 --> 00:33:29,699
Really?

414
00:33:31,118 --> 00:33:32,118
Really.

415
00:33:38,501 --> 00:33:40,127
Kill that Indian son of bitch.

416
00:34:33,222 --> 00:34:34,515
Johnny.

417
00:34:35,975 --> 00:34:37,435
How you doing?

418
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:48,237
Ben, hear you got a new foal
out at your place.

419
00:34:50,281 --> 00:34:51,449
Howdy, AI.

420
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,201
How's that new Olds working out?

421
00:34:57,747 --> 00:34:58,873
Pete.

422
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:01,750
Well,

423
00:35:02,084 --> 00:35:03,251
I think we've done enough damage

424
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:04,420
for one day, don't you?

425
00:35:05,963 --> 00:35:08,007
Mike, take care of Billy Jack.

426
00:35:10,384 --> 00:35:13,888
All right, let's everybody
go home and take a hot bath.

427
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:16,891
Wait a minute! Aren't
you going to press charges?

428
00:35:19,018 --> 00:35:20,269
Where would I begin?

429
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:31,571
Please, Martin.
Wait until they get back.

430
00:35:31,572 --> 00:35:33,824
Billy Jack said you should never
practice alone, Martin.

431
00:35:34,033 --> 00:35:35,241
You know that.

432
00:35:35,242 --> 00:35:36,952
Why don't you two
go play in the hay?

433
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:49,298
Stop it, Martin!

434
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:54,178
Please, stop!

435
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:55,763
I better go get Jean.

436
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,017
The only thing I can do
is put him in a cast

437
00:36:01,018 --> 00:36:03,229
for a month or two
and see how it mends.

438
00:36:03,854 --> 00:36:05,397
Is there anything
further we can do?

439
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:08,733
Not for him, but you better
do something about her.

440
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:09,735
Why?

441
00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:12,821
Well, her father suspects
she might be out here,

442
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:14,197
and he'll probably
come out here with

443
00:36:14,198 --> 00:36:15,758
a search party tomorrow
looking for her.

444
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:19,161
Any ideas?

445
00:36:19,537 --> 00:36:21,288
At the moment
I'm fresh out of them.

446
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:23,248
I want you to know that warrant

447
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:24,434
isn't legal on reservation land.

448
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:26,794
You don't have to let us
search unless you want to.

449
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:35,469
Cole, whose side are you on?

450
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:38,722
These people are holding this
man's daughter illegally.

451
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:45,186
Hey kids, they don't really
have a right to search here,

452
00:36:45,187 --> 00:36:47,397
but if it will make them
feel like big men,

453
00:36:47,398 --> 00:36:48,918
we're going to let
them go ahead, okay?

454
00:36:54,989 --> 00:36:56,740
To hell with this...

455
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:34,713
Well, one thing is pretty clear
Posner, she's not here.

456
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,132
I guess that means
Billy has taken her off.

457
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:40,386
Don't you think you ought to
found out where Billy is?

458
00:38:44,807 --> 00:38:46,684
Jean, they want to
know where Billy is.

459
00:38:46,934 --> 00:38:48,393
Who ever knows where Billy is?

460
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:50,687
Well, you must have some way
of getting in touch with him

461
00:38:50,688 --> 00:38:51,896
when you need him
for emergencies.

462
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:54,316
Whenever we want Billy, we just
contact him Indian style.

463
00:38:54,483 --> 00:38:55,693
What does that mean?

464
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:58,279
We just want him,
and somehow he shows up.

465
00:38:58,779 --> 00:39:01,139
How the hell are we going to
find Billy on this reservation,

466
00:39:01,657 --> 00:39:03,367
much less get Barbara if we do.

467
00:39:04,368 --> 00:39:05,910
Jean, this has gone far enough.

468
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:08,121
I think we better find Barbara
and forget the whole thing.

469
00:39:08,122 --> 00:39:09,915
I honestly don't know
where she is.

470
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:12,208
But if you did, you
would tell me?

471
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:13,876
You know me better than that.

472
00:39:13,877 --> 00:39:15,545
The only way we're going
to find Billy

473
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:18,464
is to get one of these
kids to tell us where he is.

474
00:39:18,465 --> 00:39:22,219
Offer them a reward.
I'll back it. Make it $1,000.

475
00:39:26,056 --> 00:39:28,266
Kids, can I talk
to you a minute?

476
00:39:30,728 --> 00:39:32,604
Can I talk to you
a minute, please?

477
00:39:34,398 --> 00:39:36,899
Please I want to talk to you
a minute, goddamn it!

478
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:39,152
Now look, I want my
daughter back.

479
00:39:39,153 --> 00:39:40,863
She's sick, and she needs help.

480
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:43,782
She has to be home
or in a hospital.

481
00:39:45,159 --> 00:39:47,243
Can't you damn kids
listen a minute?

482
00:39:47,244 --> 00:39:49,830
Now look I'll offer $1,000!

483
00:39:50,998 --> 00:39:53,417
You can do it anonymously,
no questions asked.

484
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:57,295
Don't you damn kids know what
you can do with $1,000?

485
00:39:57,296 --> 00:39:59,256
You can live in Big Sur
for a year!

486
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:02,925
Damn hippie creeps.

487
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:07,764
I'm sorry I got you
into all this, Jean.

488
00:40:07,765 --> 00:40:10,016
From now on it's going
to get very ugly.

489
00:40:10,017 --> 00:40:13,019
Think about it for
the sake of all these kids.

490
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,103
You think about it.

491
00:40:14,104 --> 00:40:15,438
Will you tell?

492
00:40:15,439 --> 00:40:17,316
Now you know me
better than that.

493
00:40:48,263 --> 00:40:50,224
In view of the
violence of the episode

494
00:40:50,391 --> 00:40:51,517
at the ice cream store and

495
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:53,059
in view of
the extreme likelihood

496
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,727
that more such
violence even more

497
00:40:54,728 --> 00:40:57,188
severe in nature is liable
to erupt at any moment,

498
00:40:57,189 --> 00:40:59,400
inflicting serious harm
to members of the community

499
00:40:59,566 --> 00:41:01,527
as well as students and faculty
of the school

500
00:41:02,152 --> 00:41:03,861
and in the interest
of everyone's safety

501
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:05,822
and the establishment of law
and order the board

502
00:41:05,823 --> 00:41:08,909
unanimously votes to request
the city attorney

503
00:41:09,118 --> 00:41:11,452
to seek a court injunction
restraining members

504
00:41:11,453 --> 00:41:12,453
of the Freedom School

505
00:41:12,746 --> 00:41:15,039
from coming into town
except on Saturday between

506
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,834
the hours of noon and 4:00,

507
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,044
and then only in
groups of six or less.

508
00:41:19,586 --> 00:41:21,254
To the point of this resolution,

509
00:41:21,255 --> 00:41:22,756
we're now opening the floor.

510
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,757
If you'd care to make a
statement

511
00:41:24,758 --> 00:41:27,386
or ask a question
affecting this matter.

512
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:30,698
My name is Phil Crowder,
and I'm a student at the school.

513
00:41:30,722 --> 00:41:33,267
He was beat up. All those guys
jumped Billy Jack, right?

514
00:41:33,684 --> 00:41:34,559
Mr. Chairman...

515
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,646
Would you yield?
The chair recognizes Doc.

516
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,690
I'd like to remind this board

517
00:41:39,898 --> 00:41:41,858
this board that the violence
at the ice cream parlor

518
00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:44,445
was caused by the townspeople
and Billy Jack.

519
00:41:44,611 --> 00:41:46,822
The students from the school
had nothing to with it.

520
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:51,075
There's one man on our
council here who agrees

521
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:53,745
with you that it was not
the fault of the school.

522
00:41:53,996 --> 00:41:56,956
We are there are more than one
person... excuse me.

523
00:41:56,957 --> 00:41:58,557
Well, Mary... there are a
lot of citizens

524
00:41:58,667 --> 00:41:59,959
that agree with that.

525
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,461
He has the floor...

526
00:42:01,462 --> 00:42:03,005
Why don't you take a bath?

527
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:05,757
That's a beautiful statement.

528
00:42:06,049 --> 00:42:09,135
If you have something
to say, you'll come forward and

529
00:42:09,136 --> 00:42:11,722
you'll give your name to the
give your name,

530
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,098
and make your statement.

531
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:14,850
O.K. Corrales.

532
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,811
Respect this meeting
enough to give your proper name.

533
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,147
My proper name is O.K. Corrales.

534
00:42:20,314 --> 00:42:21,856
Do you have
something against Mexicans?

535
00:42:21,857 --> 00:42:25,109
O.K. wants to speak.
Let O.K. speak. Okay, O.K.

536
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,362
Do you have anything
to say, Mr. Corrales?

537
00:42:27,529 --> 00:42:30,948
To speak to the resolution, it
opposes not only the spirit but

538
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:33,952
the letter of the constitution,
and many state and federal laws.

539
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:36,162
And it's something that you
ought to consider before you

540
00:42:36,163 --> 00:42:38,003
even bother to sending it
to the city attorney.

541
00:42:38,957 --> 00:42:40,666
The chair recognizes Mr. Posner!

542
00:42:40,667 --> 00:42:42,919
But the door doesn't!

543
00:42:48,425 --> 00:42:53,805
Order! Order! Order!
The chair recognizes Mr. Posner!

544
00:42:55,307 --> 00:42:57,184
I respect what
Mr. Corrales said.

545
00:42:57,351 --> 00:42:59,811
And our intensions are really
parallel with his.

546
00:43:00,187 --> 00:43:02,231
We would like
to preserve the peace.

547
00:43:02,689 --> 00:43:05,150
We would like to see
the children unharmed,

548
00:43:05,317 --> 00:43:08,362
and we are passing this measure
with that intent.

549
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,571
We would like
not to have violence.

550
00:43:10,572 --> 00:43:13,158
So how come your son
pours flour all over Indians?

551
00:43:14,409 --> 00:43:15,702
Mr. Johnson...

552
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:17,556
When's the last time
you cut your hair?

553
00:43:17,788 --> 00:43:20,916
When's the last time
you brushed your teeth, sir?

554
00:43:21,083 --> 00:43:22,083
You're out of order Phil.

555
00:43:23,085 --> 00:43:25,754
All right, now I want
this meeting run orderly.

556
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:30,467
Chairman by our
behavior as this council,

557
00:43:30,676 --> 00:43:33,011
we're proving
to these students that

558
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:35,222
most of the things they believe
about us are true.

559
00:43:35,764 --> 00:43:37,265
But they're proving to us

560
00:43:37,266 --> 00:43:39,685
that most of the things
we fear about them are true.

561
00:43:40,269 --> 00:43:41,895
Man, this council sucks.

562
00:43:49,111 --> 00:43:50,111
Proceed.

563
00:43:50,612 --> 00:43:53,197
A little girl in the school has
something she'd like to read.

564
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,574
What's your name, young lady?

565
00:43:54,575 --> 00:43:56,325
My name is Kit,
and her name is Carol,

566
00:43:56,326 --> 00:43:57,926
and she has something
she'd like to read.

567
00:43:59,663 --> 00:44:01,123
How old are you, young lady?

568
00:44:01,665 --> 00:44:02,665
11.

569
00:44:02,958 --> 00:44:04,001
11.

570
00:44:04,835 --> 00:44:06,378
Too old for you.

571
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:12,884
Just about old enough
for you, I guess.

572
00:44:16,179 --> 00:44:16,888
Proceed, young lady.

573
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:18,723
I'd like to read a speech,
and after it's done,

574
00:44:18,724 --> 00:44:23,061
I'd like you to guess
who said it in public.

575
00:44:23,562 --> 00:44:25,397
"The streets of our country
are in turmoil."

576
00:44:25,564 --> 00:44:26,690
The universities are filled

577
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:28,483
with students rebelling
and rioting.

578
00:44:28,942 --> 00:44:31,445
Communists are seeking
to destroy our country.

579
00:44:31,695 --> 00:44:33,738
Russia is threatening us
with their might,

580
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:36,449
and the republic
is in danger, yes danger

581
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,826
from within and from without.

582
00:44:38,327 --> 00:44:39,870
We need law and order.

583
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,998
"Without law and order,
our nation cannot survive."

584
00:44:43,373 --> 00:44:45,167
Who wrote it?

585
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:48,211
Well, that's very
nice, young lady.

586
00:44:48,503 --> 00:44:50,004
Do you want to know
who wrote it?

587
00:44:50,005 --> 00:44:51,881
Adolf Hitler wrote it in 1932,

588
00:44:51,882 --> 00:44:55,301
and everyone from Nixon's
cabinet to your council

589
00:44:55,302 --> 00:44:57,095
is repeating it today.

590
00:44:57,638 --> 00:44:59,430
Now, I'd like to know
from this child

591
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:02,100
if she would tell us who
told her to read it here?

592
00:45:02,726 --> 00:45:05,311
She has her own mind. She
can read by herself, you know.

593
00:45:05,312 --> 00:45:06,813
I wish she'd answer
the question!

594
00:45:07,064 --> 00:45:08,774
Nobody told me
to read it. I just...

595
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:09,650
Then why did you?

596
00:45:09,816 --> 00:45:11,859
I think I have a right to read
what I feel like reading.

597
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:12,860
Why did you read it?

598
00:45:12,861 --> 00:45:14,529
Were you taught this in school?

599
00:45:15,489 --> 00:45:17,156
Because her brain is damaged

600
00:45:17,157 --> 00:45:19,409
by the heathen
devil-weed, marijuana.

601
00:45:23,330 --> 00:45:24,998
Thank you, very kindly.

602
00:45:25,165 --> 00:45:26,207
She still has the floor!

603
00:45:26,208 --> 00:45:29,044
I have another question
for Mr. Posner.

604
00:45:29,836 --> 00:45:32,381
Well like this council here
is always talking

605
00:45:32,547 --> 00:45:34,256
about law and order
and things, well,

606
00:45:34,257 --> 00:45:36,968
how come he kills stallions,
which is against the law?

607
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:39,470
Right on!

608
00:45:40,555 --> 00:45:42,057
This is irrelevant
and immaterial.

609
00:45:44,893 --> 00:45:46,602
I've been sitting
here for like over an hour,

610
00:45:46,603 --> 00:45:47,843
and I've been listening to you.

611
00:45:47,938 --> 00:45:50,773
And all I can see
is that you're really scared

612
00:45:50,774 --> 00:45:52,733
and you're scared of all of us
and you're scared of me.

613
00:45:52,734 --> 00:45:53,776
Right on.

614
00:45:53,777 --> 00:45:55,319
We're scared of what you can do.

615
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,382
I can come into this town
but I'm not going to hurt you.

616
00:45:57,406 --> 00:45:58,926
I'm not going to do
anything like that.

617
00:45:59,199 --> 00:46:00,659
How do I intimidate you?

618
00:46:00,867 --> 00:46:02,661
Because, like,
I'm another human being.

619
00:46:03,245 --> 00:46:05,789
Are you scared of me sexually?
What is it?

620
00:46:08,083 --> 00:46:09,584
I really want an answer.

621
00:46:09,835 --> 00:46:10,835
I'll give you an answer:

622
00:46:11,336 --> 00:46:13,505
Because you're a filthy
little girl.

623
00:46:13,714 --> 00:46:15,006
David! You're out order!

624
00:46:20,178 --> 00:46:22,889
You're sick! Every one of you!
Go ahead and take a bath!

625
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,572
You're out of order!

626
00:46:39,698 --> 00:46:42,367
You want to speak?
You'll have your opportunity!

627
00:46:43,285 --> 00:46:45,120
Order! Order!

628
00:46:48,123 --> 00:46:49,291
Hold it!

629
00:46:49,708 --> 00:46:52,335
Hold it, everybody
is a little crazy.

630
00:46:53,837 --> 00:46:55,255
You people think you're free.

631
00:46:58,467 --> 00:47:00,761
Why don't we all calm down for
a few minutes,

632
00:47:01,136 --> 00:47:03,221
and probably the best thing
to do would be

633
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:05,307
if you all could
come out to the school and see

634
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,308
what we do at our natural
habitat.

635
00:47:07,309 --> 00:47:09,352
This is a fine
example of what you do.

636
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:15,150
We've been invited
to this council...

637
00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:17,109
Chairman!

638
00:47:17,194 --> 00:47:18,236
Chairman!

639
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:21,198
This is no more an example
of what the school is like

640
00:47:21,364 --> 00:47:23,408
than it is for
what the town is like,

641
00:47:23,617 --> 00:47:27,162
and what you're like as people.

642
00:47:28,205 --> 00:47:31,458
This is the example,
This is the example!

643
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:34,503
Are you afraid? Come on
out to the school and see us.

644
00:47:34,753 --> 00:47:36,838
Yes. I, for one, am afraid.

645
00:47:37,172 --> 00:47:39,090
Will any of you come
to the school?

646
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:42,010
Very well. Very
well. I will come.

647
00:47:45,555 --> 00:47:48,683
Well, I don't know, man.
I don't feel loaded, y'know.

648
00:47:49,893 --> 00:47:51,228
We should smoke another one?

649
00:47:51,645 --> 00:47:53,438
Okay. My grass or yours?

650
00:47:54,856 --> 00:47:57,818
All tastes about the same
past a certain point.

651
00:47:58,193 --> 00:47:59,945
I think your taste buds
have burned out.

652
00:48:00,445 --> 00:48:02,948
No, actually, it's my brain
that's burned out.

653
00:48:10,997 --> 00:48:12,457
Cool it! There's a
plain-clothes car

654
00:48:12,624 --> 00:48:13,810
coming out at the intersection.

655
00:48:13,834 --> 00:48:15,877
Come on, man.
Straighten up and act normal.

656
00:48:22,634 --> 00:48:24,434
You sure look weird
when you're acting normal.

657
00:48:31,017 --> 00:48:33,143
The red one means stop, right?

658
00:48:33,144 --> 00:48:34,144
Right.

659
00:48:36,356 --> 00:48:38,108
Keeps you on your toes.

660
00:48:38,942 --> 00:48:41,111
Don't you think you better
pull up to the intersection?

661
00:48:43,488 --> 00:48:44,698
Just testing you.

662
00:48:46,491 --> 00:48:48,284
Hey, look! Over in the next car.

663
00:48:48,285 --> 00:48:51,037
A couple of high school
kids passing a joint around.

664
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:54,623
I'll turn on the red light.

665
00:48:54,624 --> 00:48:56,626
Right. You kids
want to pull over up here!

666
00:48:59,629 --> 00:49:02,423
The police when they see
them in their rear-view mirrors.

667
00:49:02,424 --> 00:49:04,091
Yeah, it seemed a
little one-sided to me.

668
00:49:04,092 --> 00:49:06,761
Yeah, but kids look
at things one-sided.

669
00:49:06,928 --> 00:49:08,262
Most of the things they're
looking at

670
00:49:08,263 --> 00:49:09,430
are pretty much one-sided.

671
00:49:09,431 --> 00:49:11,284
Well no I have an idea though,
let's try something here.

672
00:49:11,308 --> 00:49:12,392
Would you want to come up?

673
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:16,146
By the way does everybody know
who Mr. Eldridge

674
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:18,356
and Miss Osgood
from the city council?

675
00:49:20,483 --> 00:49:21,859
Why don't we do another scene

676
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,987
which involves a policeman
and differing attitudes

677
00:49:24,988 --> 00:49:27,348
so we can use your attitude
about policemen as well as ours.

678
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:31,076
And, Kit, we want you
to come up too.

679
00:49:31,077 --> 00:49:34,414
And why don't
Kit you be a mother

680
00:49:34,748 --> 00:49:37,125
and Howard be a father
a family together?

681
00:49:37,334 --> 00:49:40,253
And, Ed, why don't you be
a Sheriff Cole?

682
00:49:40,837 --> 00:49:44,966
And the two of you be teenage
children there of this family.

683
00:49:45,258 --> 00:49:48,385
Sure! Sure!

684
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:49,887
Well, I just can't do that.

685
00:49:49,888 --> 00:49:51,139
Sure you can.

686
00:49:51,306 --> 00:49:53,808
Sheriff, why don't
arrest them for, say, marijuana

687
00:49:54,017 --> 00:49:55,184
and then take them home

688
00:49:55,185 --> 00:49:57,019
to meet their parents
and explain the situation.

689
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,146
Are you ready to be busted?

690
00:49:58,355 --> 00:50:00,982
You're under arrest.
Come with me.

691
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:05,612
Hello, Kit. What brings me
here are these two.

692
00:50:06,279 --> 00:50:07,488
Some trouble sheriff?

693
00:50:07,489 --> 00:50:08,447
Yes, Howard.

694
00:50:08,448 --> 00:50:10,208
I'm very sorry to have
to come here for this,

695
00:50:10,325 --> 00:50:11,594
but these children
have been smoking

696
00:50:11,618 --> 00:50:13,160
marijuana with a known
dope fiend.

697
00:50:13,161 --> 00:50:15,288
What? Our children?

698
00:50:15,538 --> 00:50:17,289
I want to thank you
again for coming down.

699
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,626
Well I'm sorry it had
to happen this way.

700
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:21,377
I know I appreciate
your doing this.

701
00:50:21,378 --> 00:50:22,730
We'll see you Saturday night
at the Donavans'.

702
00:50:22,754 --> 00:50:23,754
Sure. Good luck.

703
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:24,546
Pig!

704
00:50:24,547 --> 00:50:26,674
Kit! Love from Marge!

705
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:28,300
Bye-bye. Thanks again, Cole.

706
00:50:28,301 --> 00:50:30,052
All right, just calm down.
Calm down!

707
00:50:30,053 --> 00:50:31,637
How can I come down
at a time like this?

708
00:50:31,638 --> 00:50:32,639
Just sit down. Sit down.

709
00:50:32,847 --> 00:50:33,847
How can I sit down?

710
00:50:33,848 --> 00:50:35,225
Just bend your legs and sit!

711
00:50:35,475 --> 00:50:37,101
Now just calm down.
Now what happened here?

712
00:50:37,102 --> 00:50:37,644
Nothing happened.

713
00:50:37,811 --> 00:50:38,829
What do you mean
nothing happened?

714
00:50:38,853 --> 00:50:40,563
Nothing happened.
Can you believe me?

715
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:41,356
He lied to us.

716
00:50:41,523 --> 00:50:42,232
That's right. He lied.

717
00:50:42,399 --> 00:50:44,316
You listen. We pay
that man to tell us the truth!

718
00:50:44,317 --> 00:50:45,753
- Now what happened?
- Nothing happened.

719
00:50:45,777 --> 00:50:48,570
Saint Jones, you owe me
an honest explanation.

720
00:50:48,571 --> 00:50:49,738
I want to hear it right now.

721
00:50:49,739 --> 00:50:51,031
- I'm not your dog.
- Right On!

722
00:50:51,032 --> 00:50:52,658
As long as you live
under my roof

723
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:54,159
and eat the clothes I give you...

724
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,662
I owe you!

725
00:50:56,663 --> 00:50:58,583
What are you, are you
high on the stuff?! Get up!

726
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,000
Don't yell at me!

727
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:01,519
Don't use that tone
of voice with me.

728
00:51:01,543 --> 00:51:02,293
Dig yourself!

729
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,504
What's that supposed
to mean, young lady?

730
00:51:04,879 --> 00:51:07,173
What happened?

731
00:51:07,465 --> 00:51:08,174
I don't know.

732
00:51:08,341 --> 00:51:09,133
Tell me what happened,

733
00:51:09,134 --> 00:51:10,736
or I'll knock the words
right out off your mouth.

734
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,387
Nothing happened.

735
00:51:12,554 --> 00:51:13,823
Are you smoking
this dope or not?

736
00:51:13,847 --> 00:51:14,555
No.

737
00:51:14,556 --> 00:51:16,765
Snake, you talk to me, or you
are going to be in big trouble.

738
00:51:16,766 --> 00:51:17,766
Violent creature!

739
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,687
Come talk to me.

740
00:51:21,688 --> 00:51:25,150
You're just a big hypocrite.
That's what you are!

741
00:51:27,736 --> 00:51:29,612
Get the door!

742
00:51:30,447 --> 00:51:31,527
Tell him we don't want any.

743
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:32,865
Get the door!

744
00:51:32,866 --> 00:51:34,034
Tell him we don't want any.

745
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:37,327
Sit! Watch television. Now watch
the television and enjoy it.

746
00:51:39,205 --> 00:51:40,685
Just everyone be quiet
for a second...

747
00:51:40,915 --> 00:51:42,709
Watch yourself.

748
00:51:43,001 --> 00:51:44,761
And I wondered if
everything was all right...

749
00:51:44,836 --> 00:51:46,963
Snake's car broke down,

750
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,339
and Cole was kind enough
to bring him home.

751
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,550
You hypocrite!

752
00:51:50,717 --> 00:51:52,237
Now you watch your
language, young man.

753
00:51:52,302 --> 00:51:54,386
- You told me...
- Never mind what I told you!

754
00:51:54,387 --> 00:51:55,387
I'm telling you something
different!

755
00:51:55,388 --> 00:51:57,306
A whole new set of lies!

756
00:51:57,307 --> 00:52:03,021
Show some respect for your
father, son. I'll thrash you!

757
00:52:03,271 --> 00:52:03,980
If you ask me,

758
00:52:04,189 --> 00:52:05,815
I think you ought to put on
a whole show.

759
00:52:05,982 --> 00:52:08,568
Invite the whole town. Let 'em
know what you're doing up here.

760
00:52:08,777 --> 00:52:09,986
Why not?

761
00:52:14,282 --> 00:52:15,909
Is Billy still in the kiva?

762
00:52:16,076 --> 00:52:18,411
No. The grandfather
took him away.

763
00:52:18,995 --> 00:52:20,079
Would you like to come

764
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,623
and watch the ceremony with me?

765
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:31,549
What is the snake ceremony?

766
00:52:31,758 --> 00:52:34,070
It's a ceremony where Billy
becomes a brother to the snake.

767
00:52:34,094 --> 00:52:35,095
How does he do that?

768
00:52:35,345 --> 00:52:36,345
By going on the mountain

769
00:52:36,346 --> 00:52:38,973
and being bitten by the snake
over and over.

770
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:41,309
Then he passes
into unconsciousness

771
00:52:41,476 --> 00:52:43,019
for the last
time and if he lives

772
00:52:43,311 --> 00:52:46,146
he has a vision and in this
vision he finds out what his

773
00:52:46,147 --> 00:52:48,399
life's mission will be
and who the spirit will be

774
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:49,943
to guide him on this mission.

775
00:52:51,528 --> 00:52:54,781
Also during this purification
part Billy has taken a secret

776
00:52:54,948 --> 00:52:57,909
herb medicine and given a sacred
poultice to put on the bites.

777
00:52:58,243 --> 00:53:00,286
Without it,
he would die for sure.

778
00:53:00,787 --> 00:53:02,663
It takes about three days

779
00:53:02,664 --> 00:53:04,544
for the poison to work
its way through his body.

780
00:53:04,874 --> 00:53:06,959
And by then
it'll either kill him

781
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,586
or make him a blood
brother to the snake.

782
00:53:10,255 --> 00:53:11,255
Listen.

783
00:53:11,631 --> 00:53:13,466
The old man is giving him
a final blessing.

784
00:53:14,384 --> 00:53:17,387
Achieva the Snake waits for you

785
00:53:17,554 --> 00:53:19,055
upon sacred mountain.

786
00:53:19,264 --> 00:53:22,892
If you pass this test,
then you will have a vision.

787
00:53:23,685 --> 00:53:25,018
It is not easy,

788
00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:27,063
and if you show fear,
you shall die.

789
00:53:28,106 --> 00:53:31,025
Hold on to this eagle feather,
and do not let it go,

790
00:53:31,818 --> 00:53:34,571
regardless of what you see
or what you hear.

791
00:53:35,488 --> 00:53:37,240
The demons will come
and try to scare you,

792
00:53:37,907 --> 00:53:39,659
but show no fear
or you shall die.

793
00:53:40,827 --> 00:53:48,827
May the Great Spirit
watch over you.

794
00:55:22,136 --> 00:55:24,180
How long before we know?

795
00:55:24,514 --> 00:55:25,514
Tomorrow.

796
00:55:44,325 --> 00:55:47,537
The time is now when
the Indian will triumph.

797
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:49,664
He's still in the rapture
of the vision.

798
00:55:50,039 --> 00:55:51,958
A great Indian holy man, Wovoka,

799
00:55:52,166 --> 00:55:53,251
is speaking through him.

800
00:55:54,168 --> 00:55:56,087
You mean they had holy men,
like saints?

801
00:55:56,254 --> 00:55:57,421
They sure did.

802
00:55:57,422 --> 00:55:59,007
And Wovoka was one
of the greatest.

803
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,301
Once even Christ
appeared to him.

804
00:56:01,968 --> 00:56:03,487
To prevail, and
the whole spiritual wisdom

805
00:56:03,511 --> 00:56:05,805
of the great holy men of the

806
00:56:05,972 --> 00:56:08,057
Indian tradition is now

807
00:56:08,224 --> 00:56:10,560
what the young people of
the world are looking for.

808
00:56:11,352 --> 00:56:12,645
I wonder if I have the guts.

809
00:56:12,895 --> 00:56:14,187
This is crazy, man.

810
00:56:14,188 --> 00:56:16,691
You pull that trigger and well
never get out of here alive.

811
00:56:17,025 --> 00:56:18,817
The young whites, they know

812
00:56:18,818 --> 00:56:21,446
there is a supernatural
world and a great spirit,

813
00:56:21,612 --> 00:56:23,132
and they try to reach
the Great Spirit.

814
00:56:24,073 --> 00:56:25,241
They try by drugs.

815
00:56:26,034 --> 00:56:27,367
They are made to do this

816
00:56:27,368 --> 00:56:29,329
because their religions no
longer believe

817
00:56:29,495 --> 00:56:30,495
in the other world.

818
00:56:30,705 --> 00:56:34,125
Heaven is not out there,
the other world is here.

819
00:56:34,709 --> 00:56:40,340
The Great Spirit, the Messiah,
the Christ are here in this pit.

820
00:56:40,715 --> 00:56:43,593
Your people, my loved ones,

821
00:56:44,218 --> 00:56:47,221
there is a thin veil
separating us from them.

822
00:56:48,681 --> 00:56:51,642
The whites do not know how to
reach through that veil,

823
00:56:51,809 --> 00:56:53,311
they do not have the belief

824
00:56:53,728 --> 00:56:56,773
and they cannot touch their
loved ones or the other spirits.

825
00:56:59,942 --> 00:57:02,403
I could do it. I could kill him.

826
00:57:02,737 --> 00:57:05,072
Yeah, sure you can.
But not now, man!

827
00:57:05,073 --> 00:57:06,633
Let's get out of here
and get some help.

828
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:08,701
And lastly you must
learn the dance,

829
00:57:09,786 --> 00:57:12,997
the dance of friendship
and welcome in which all

830
00:57:13,164 --> 00:57:15,082
whites who come to you with
open hearts

831
00:57:15,083 --> 00:57:17,502
must be taught the dance
in the Indian way.

832
00:57:18,169 --> 00:57:20,546
Rise up now and I will teach
you the dance

833
00:57:20,713 --> 00:57:24,258
exactly as Wovoka
has seen it should be done.

834
00:57:25,301 --> 00:57:27,970
Yeah, well be back.
But not with help.

835
00:57:30,431 --> 00:57:32,100
I'm going to get him
all by myself.

836
00:57:48,074 --> 00:57:51,577
Hey, Bernard!
Isn't that Barbara?

837
00:57:55,915 --> 00:57:59,544
Damn! She is screwing
around with an Indian.

838
00:58:00,628 --> 00:58:01,788
I thought that was just talk.

839
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:13,557
Okay, Martin. You run
and get the paint,

840
00:58:13,558 --> 00:58:14,892
and we'll pick you up later,
okay?

841
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:18,019
Okay. I don't see how you expect
me to carry all the paint?

842
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:20,648
You hang it up on the
top of your crunches.

843
00:58:22,108 --> 00:58:23,151
Hey...

844
00:58:26,946 --> 00:58:28,573
Can we bring it back in
case it isn't

845
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:30,019
it might be kind of, you know...

846
00:58:30,408 --> 00:58:31,409
Yeah, look at these.

847
00:58:31,701 --> 00:58:33,453
They're great.

848
00:58:34,203 --> 00:58:36,706
And if you help us get
her out of there,

849
00:58:36,956 --> 00:58:38,583
you'll not
only collect that big fat

850
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:41,669
reward I offered, but you'll
save someone's life.

851
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:43,880
Like whose?

852
00:58:44,672 --> 00:58:45,672
Yours.

853
00:58:46,048 --> 00:58:47,049
And Billy Jack's.

854
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,552
But if you fail to help us as
sure as this pipe is at your

855
00:58:50,553 --> 00:58:52,930
throat you're going to be
one hell of a dead Indian.

856
00:58:53,848 --> 00:58:54,474
Savvy?

857
00:58:54,682 --> 00:58:56,142
You know, I think he
is sweet on her.

858
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,101
Did it look that
way to you Dinosaur?

859
00:58:58,102 --> 00:59:01,772
Yeah. Holding hands,
kissing her...

860
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:09,614
Now you listen to me,
grease ball.

861
00:59:10,573 --> 00:59:12,533
If you ever touch her again,

862
00:59:12,783 --> 00:59:14,951
I'm going to cripple your
other leg, and I don't mean

863
00:59:14,952 --> 00:59:16,871
the one you walk on, you hear?

864
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,209
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

865
00:59:22,043 --> 00:59:24,711
Well, I guess the boys found him
sneaking out the back

866
00:59:24,712 --> 00:59:25,712
without paying.

867
00:59:26,339 --> 00:59:27,339
Right, Sam?

868
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,426
Yeah, that's right.

869
00:59:30,927 --> 00:59:32,720
What are the charges, then, Sam?

870
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,892
You heard me,
what are the charges?

871
00:59:38,351 --> 00:59:39,101
Charges?

872
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:41,145
Well, no charges.

873
00:59:41,312 --> 00:59:42,772
Sam here is a pretty good guy.

874
00:59:43,356 --> 00:59:45,236
You're not going to press
charges, are you, Sam?

875
00:59:45,274 --> 00:59:45,900
No charges.

876
00:59:46,192 --> 00:59:48,194
No, you're a nice guy,
aren't you, Sam?

877
00:59:52,949 --> 00:59:56,201
You're a dirty, rotten,
lying son of a...

878
00:59:56,202 --> 00:59:57,203
Bitch!

879
00:59:57,578 --> 01:00:00,790
We are going to do it
because of the injunction,

880
01:00:00,957 --> 01:00:02,541
we're going to do it
by their rules,

881
01:00:02,542 --> 01:00:04,102
but we're going
to do with our attitudes.

882
01:00:04,126 --> 01:00:06,211
And what we want to do
is to send six people,

883
01:00:06,212 --> 01:00:08,381
because that's as much
as we can, into town,

884
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:11,079
where we're going to do some
street theatre rather than...

885
01:00:11,133 --> 01:00:13,343
Sure! Why let Bernard and the
deputy ruin all the friendships

886
01:00:13,344 --> 01:00:14,178
we're starting to build.

887
01:00:14,345 --> 01:00:16,222
It just pulls us down
to their level.

888
01:00:34,282 --> 01:00:36,402
Give me all your money!
Give me your money. Come on...

889
01:00:36,576 --> 01:00:38,661
I left my wallet at home.

890
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:40,746
Well, you got any change?

891
01:00:40,913 --> 01:00:41,913
No, sorry.

892
01:00:41,998 --> 01:00:42,998
What's in the briefcase?

893
01:00:43,249 --> 01:00:44,249
Yogurt.

894
01:00:44,709 --> 01:00:45,751
You got a wristwatch?

895
01:00:45,918 --> 01:00:47,794
Well, it's a Timex, actually.

896
01:00:47,795 --> 01:00:49,130
What did you pay for the band?

897
01:00:49,338 --> 01:00:52,675
No, man! That doesn't work!
That doesn't scare me.

898
01:00:52,967 --> 01:00:54,175
You've blown it as a robber.

899
01:00:54,176 --> 01:00:55,256
You've got to come out here

900
01:00:55,344 --> 01:00:57,679
and give this man something
for his trouble.

901
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:59,807
I as a spectator
felt nothing for you

902
01:00:59,974 --> 01:01:01,767
other than total embarrassment.

903
01:01:02,018 --> 01:01:04,437
You've got to let this man
know that as the robber

904
01:01:04,687 --> 01:01:07,690
you are going to give a
performance to the rob-ee.

905
01:01:08,441 --> 01:01:09,734
Now you've got no energy.

906
01:01:09,942 --> 01:01:11,152
You need a subtext.

907
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,445
In theatre it's a place

908
01:01:12,653 --> 01:01:14,780
where you get your energy
from the center

909
01:01:14,947 --> 01:01:17,824
so that you can bring
it out, all at once.

910
01:01:17,825 --> 01:01:20,025
Now, what's the first emotion
that comes into your head?

911
01:01:20,828 --> 01:01:21,703
Confusion.

912
01:01:21,704 --> 01:01:24,332
All right. Then use that
and bring out that energy.

913
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:26,150
Do you have any bullets
in the gun?

914
01:01:26,334 --> 01:01:27,654
No. I didn't want to
hurt anybody.

915
01:01:27,835 --> 01:01:30,379
You should put a bullet in
there so that he knows, see?

916
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:32,733
Or at least make him think
there are bullets in there.

917
01:01:32,757 --> 01:01:34,359
Did you think there were
any bullets in the gun?

918
01:01:34,383 --> 01:01:35,926
Well, I wasn't very intimidated.

919
01:01:36,344 --> 01:01:37,511
I didn't. I'm sorry.

920
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,220
Okay, well, it doesn't
work that way.

921
01:01:39,221 --> 01:01:41,223
You take the gun
and you put a bullet in it,

922
01:01:41,432 --> 01:01:43,309
and have that feeling
of power that you plant

923
01:01:43,476 --> 01:01:46,103
in the back of your brain and
you mix it with your energy

924
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:47,937
so that when you come out here,

925
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:49,981
you come out a dynamo
of robbery.

926
01:01:49,982 --> 01:01:52,401
A man who's going to get
respect as well as money.

927
01:01:52,652 --> 01:01:55,029
I'm going to be robbing you in
just a second, so hold on.

928
01:01:55,363 --> 01:01:57,406
Okay I'm going to show you
exactly what I mean,

929
01:01:57,698 --> 01:01:59,407
you get yourself together as a

930
01:01:59,408 --> 01:02:01,242
robber and you can even keep
it down

931
01:02:01,243 --> 01:02:03,412
because it's all
flowing out so fast,

932
01:02:03,621 --> 01:02:06,165
so you keep it cool
and you play it yourself

933
01:02:06,582 --> 01:02:08,501
and this man won't
know what is happening and

934
01:02:08,709 --> 01:02:11,879
you come up to him very cool,
let's have your money.

935
01:02:12,588 --> 01:02:13,338
Let's go.

936
01:02:13,339 --> 01:02:14,339
Freeze!

937
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:16,332
I don't want to hurt you, son,

938
01:02:16,384 --> 01:02:18,094
so don't you make
any sudden move.

939
01:02:19,387 --> 01:02:22,431
Now you just very slowly drop
that gun down on the sidewalk?

940
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:26,686
Put your hands up above your
head, way up!

941
01:02:27,103 --> 01:02:29,313
Move to your right. Keep moving.

942
01:02:31,774 --> 01:02:33,317
Hey, you! I want you...

943
01:02:33,526 --> 01:02:34,819
No, man!

944
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:35,986
Absolutely not!

945
01:02:36,404 --> 01:02:39,364
You took your eyes off me and
I'm the suspect.

946
01:02:39,365 --> 01:02:41,534
When you look at me and you
get me

947
01:02:41,784 --> 01:02:43,577
and you don't say
freeze while I've got a gun

948
01:02:43,744 --> 01:02:45,996
pointed his head. I could
freeze his brains out.

949
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:48,164
There's an honest
tax-paying citizen

950
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:50,418
ready to blow his own
foot up because you

951
01:02:50,626 --> 01:02:52,586
haven't put the situation in
your control

952
01:02:52,795 --> 01:02:54,672
with something
short and sharp and

953
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:57,550
authoritative like drop the
gun and up against the wall.

954
01:02:57,967 --> 01:02:59,218
Hey man, now come...

955
01:03:03,139 --> 01:03:04,557
What's going on here?

956
01:03:04,807 --> 01:03:06,934
I think it would be
a lot clearer

957
01:03:07,101 --> 01:03:09,144
if perhaps we just did
it all over again.

958
01:03:09,145 --> 01:03:10,145
Very good idea.

959
01:03:10,312 --> 01:03:12,314
Okay, fine.
We'll take it from the top.

960
01:03:12,481 --> 01:03:15,568
Okay here's your gun. Remember
energy is what's important.

961
01:03:15,735 --> 01:03:16,901
I'm waiting for the bus, right?

962
01:03:16,902 --> 01:03:17,611
You're waiting for the bus.

963
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:19,220
What have I got here,
three psychos?

964
01:03:19,363 --> 01:03:20,448
You're not even here yet.

965
01:03:22,992 --> 01:03:24,075
Okay, give me your money

966
01:03:24,076 --> 01:03:26,116
because I'm confused and
I'll explode at any minute.

967
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:28,748
I forgot the line.

968
01:03:28,956 --> 01:03:30,290
"Drop the gun
up against the wall."

969
01:03:30,291 --> 01:03:32,041
I can't drop the gun.
I've got bullets in it.

970
01:03:32,042 --> 01:03:33,419
Well, then take the bullets out.

971
01:03:35,504 --> 01:03:37,672
Wait a minute. I have
an idea. Here, here.

972
01:03:37,673 --> 01:03:39,341
Excuse me.
Here, take the briefcase.

973
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:41,677
All right, now look.

974
01:03:41,927 --> 01:03:43,595
You stand right over here, sir,

975
01:03:43,596 --> 01:03:46,056
and you'll see
the whole thing right

976
01:03:46,474 --> 01:03:47,224
from the beginning now.

977
01:03:47,391 --> 01:03:49,351
You're a businessman,
you're a...

978
01:03:49,685 --> 01:03:51,103
Let him discover
all those things.

979
01:03:51,312 --> 01:03:52,354
Fine, good idea.

980
01:03:52,605 --> 01:03:54,482
What if the bus comes?
Do I get on it?

981
01:03:54,648 --> 01:03:55,816
Don't play it that real.

982
01:04:02,072 --> 01:04:04,450
Okay give me all your money
right now, or bad news.

983
01:04:05,159 --> 01:04:06,994
All right, drop the gun.

984
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:11,998
I think that gesture is
a little too flamboyant.

985
01:04:11,999 --> 01:04:14,460
I wouldn't use that. But you
get the tone, don't you?

986
01:04:14,877 --> 01:04:16,545
Right, the line was good.

987
01:04:16,712 --> 01:04:18,589
That was the important thing...

988
01:04:18,881 --> 01:04:20,883
Let's take it from the top
once more, please.

989
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:22,468
You're beginning to mesh
as a unit.

990
01:04:23,385 --> 01:04:24,552
Can I be the robber this time?

991
01:04:24,553 --> 01:04:25,470
Sure, mix it up.

992
01:04:25,471 --> 01:04:26,889
- My hat...
- Yes. Your hat.

993
01:04:27,097 --> 01:04:28,723
No subtext is fine,

994
01:04:28,724 --> 01:04:30,809
but he just wants to play
another guy.

995
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:32,353
I get to be the
sheriff, don't I?

996
01:04:32,603 --> 01:04:33,979
Right - But I'm not here yet.

997
01:04:34,146 --> 01:04:34,897
No you're not here.

998
01:04:35,064 --> 01:04:36,856
Okay, I'm gonna warn you,
if you drop the gun again,

999
01:04:36,857 --> 01:04:38,358
I'm going to mess up
the briefcase.

1000
01:04:38,359 --> 01:04:40,109
- Fair is fair.
- Okay, fine.

1001
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:41,296
Okay, so I'm waiting
for the bus.

1002
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,738
Right, you're a businessman.

1003
01:04:42,947 --> 01:04:44,323
Where is that darn bus?

1004
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:46,909
Well, Madge and the kids
are gonna...

1005
01:04:47,952 --> 01:04:49,495
All right, you!

1006
01:04:49,787 --> 01:04:51,455
You've got to be prepared.

1007
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:54,083
All right, one of you...
I don't care who it is...

1008
01:04:54,333 --> 01:04:55,709
Get up there and drop the gun.

1009
01:04:55,918 --> 01:04:57,502
Okay, man. I warned you.

1010
01:04:57,503 --> 01:04:59,128
You're going to throw the gun
around...

1011
01:04:59,129 --> 01:05:00,464
Hey! Hey! New briefcase there.

1012
01:05:00,673 --> 01:05:01,673
I borrowed the gun!

1013
01:05:01,715 --> 01:05:02,758
I don't care if it's a...

1014
01:05:04,927 --> 01:05:06,511
Okay, Jean. Is that enough?

1015
01:05:10,182 --> 01:05:11,475
You knew she was there?

1016
01:05:11,642 --> 01:05:13,402
I knew she was there,
you knew she was there.

1017
01:05:13,602 --> 01:05:15,436
Did you know she was there?

1018
01:05:15,437 --> 01:05:17,189
Yeah, come by the school
anytime.

1019
01:05:39,128 --> 01:05:40,408
You like nice things, don't you?

1020
01:05:40,504 --> 01:05:42,171
You better believe it.

1021
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:45,259
Maybe you can have them
sooner than you think.

1022
01:05:46,176 --> 01:05:47,970
Just what's that
supposed to mean?

1023
01:05:49,638 --> 01:05:50,764
You heard the deputy.

1024
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:54,268
He'll pay $1,000
just to find out

1025
01:05:54,435 --> 01:05:56,812
where his daughter is.
No questions asked.

1026
01:05:57,688 --> 01:05:59,565
Look, those kids are my friends.

1027
01:06:00,691 --> 01:06:02,192
What kind of person
do you think I am?

1028
01:06:05,279 --> 01:06:06,655
One would do anything
for a buck.

1029
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,960
Where is Billy Jack
hiding Barbara?

1030
01:06:20,836 --> 01:06:22,379
I honestly don't know.

1031
01:06:22,713 --> 01:06:25,591
Okay, Miss False Eyelashes.

1032
01:06:26,091 --> 01:06:27,384
Off with your blouse.

1033
01:06:29,595 --> 01:06:30,638
OFF!

1034
01:06:47,112 --> 01:06:48,155
Where's Barbara?

1035
01:06:48,572 --> 01:06:52,076
Please... I don't know
where she is.

1036
01:06:52,368 --> 01:06:56,246
None of the kids do. I'd tell
you if I knew, I would,

1037
01:06:56,413 --> 01:06:58,749
but I don't know where she is.

1038
01:07:02,211 --> 01:07:03,712
All the way off...

1039
01:07:40,624 --> 01:07:42,167
I can't believe it.

1040
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:44,378
I really can't believe this guy.

1041
01:07:45,587 --> 01:07:46,797
Can you believe him?

1042
01:07:47,715 --> 01:07:49,091
Not really, no.

1043
01:07:49,425 --> 01:07:50,676
You know what he reminds me of?

1044
01:07:51,301 --> 01:07:51,885
What?

1045
01:07:52,261 --> 01:07:53,261
A little monkey.

1046
01:07:54,096 --> 01:07:55,222
Posner's little monkey,

1047
01:07:55,556 --> 01:07:57,808
just running around trying
to get in all the bananas.

1048
01:08:00,185 --> 01:08:01,645
Get your blouse
and get out of here.

1049
01:08:02,187 --> 01:08:03,187
Will you look?

1050
01:08:05,941 --> 01:08:07,151
Probably.

1051
01:08:07,568 --> 01:08:09,069
Go on, get your blouse.

1052
01:08:13,198 --> 01:08:14,324
Okay, Bernard.

1053
01:08:16,994 --> 01:08:19,079
Get out of the car and let's
teach you a lesson

1054
01:08:19,246 --> 01:08:21,248
your daddy should have
taught you a long time ago.

1055
01:08:21,832 --> 01:08:23,125
No, Billy, you can't do it.

1056
01:08:24,626 --> 01:08:25,419
If you hurt Bernard,

1057
01:08:25,586 --> 01:08:27,462
they're going to close down
the school and ruin everything

1058
01:08:27,463 --> 01:08:28,463
we've tried to build.

1059
01:08:29,048 --> 01:08:30,424
What do you suggest I do?

1060
01:08:30,758 --> 01:08:33,093
Teach him a lesson, but
without really hurting him.

1061
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:34,510
How?

1062
01:08:40,184 --> 01:08:42,102
Why don't you drive his
car into the lake?

1063
01:08:44,563 --> 01:08:45,563
What?

1064
01:08:45,647 --> 01:08:49,109
I said why don't you
drive his car into the lake.

1065
01:08:53,155 --> 01:08:55,240
You know, that's not
a bad thought for a pacifist.

1066
01:08:55,991 --> 01:08:56,991
We have our days.

1067
01:09:03,207 --> 01:09:04,792
All right, Bernard.

1068
01:09:05,542 --> 01:09:06,710
Which is it going to be?

1069
01:09:07,628 --> 01:09:09,213
Drive your car into the lake

1070
01:09:09,463 --> 01:09:12,883
or... get a dislocated elbow?

1071
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:14,467
What do you mean
dislocated elbow?

1072
01:09:14,468 --> 01:09:15,748
What are you, nuts or something?

1073
01:09:16,929 --> 01:09:19,515
Yeah, a lot of people think so.

1074
01:09:20,641 --> 01:09:22,476
But then we're stuck
with that, you and I.

1075
01:09:23,519 --> 01:09:24,520
Now which is it gonna be?

1076
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:26,855
My old man is going to kill me
if anything happens.

1077
01:09:27,022 --> 01:09:29,024
He just bought this car for me.

1078
01:09:29,233 --> 01:09:31,610
I mean, he'll kill me
if I hurt this car. Really.

1079
01:09:32,528 --> 01:09:35,489
Come on, Bernard.
You get to choose.

1080
01:09:36,532 --> 01:09:37,699
Which is it going to be?

1081
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:43,997
What if I drive away?
Or take the knife.

1082
01:09:47,918 --> 01:09:50,963
Bernard, I wish you would.

1083
01:09:52,464 --> 01:09:55,259
I really wish you would.

1084
01:09:55,509 --> 01:09:57,109
Don't, Bernard. You
don't stand a chance.

1085
01:09:58,178 --> 01:09:59,847
Next time I'll cut off your bra!

1086
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:01,974
Now...

1087
01:10:02,724 --> 01:10:03,809
You've got to choose.

1088
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:10,566
When I count to three...

1089
01:10:12,484 --> 01:10:14,069
You drive your car in the lake.

1090
01:10:16,822 --> 01:10:17,822
One...

1091
01:10:20,409 --> 01:10:21,493
Two...

1092
01:10:24,746 --> 01:10:25,746
FLOOR IT!

1093
01:10:45,559 --> 01:10:46,643
You're gonna sit there

1094
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:49,146
and tell me that he didn't
pull a gun on you?

1095
01:10:49,771 --> 01:10:51,565
A knife? Nothing?

1096
01:10:53,609 --> 01:10:54,609
Nothing.

1097
01:10:55,444 --> 01:10:58,280
He just told you to drive
the car in the lake,

1098
01:10:59,239 --> 01:11:00,239
and you obeyed him?

1099
01:11:02,701 --> 01:11:04,203
Now why didn't you drive away?

1100
01:11:06,538 --> 01:11:07,789
I was scared.

1101
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,081
You were what?

1102
01:11:09,082 --> 01:11:10,082
I WAS SCARED!

1103
01:11:10,792 --> 01:11:12,294
You were sacred?

1104
01:11:13,086 --> 01:11:14,253
You were scared,

1105
01:11:14,254 --> 01:11:17,049
so you drove a $6,000
automobile into the lake?

1106
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:19,384
Well, you're nothing
but a lousy coward.

1107
01:11:21,345 --> 01:11:24,806
Cole, things are getting
uglier and uglier around here.

1108
01:11:26,391 --> 01:11:27,893
Nothing but a lot
of hot heads in town

1109
01:11:28,101 --> 01:11:29,685
that would like nothing
better than to charge right

1110
01:11:29,686 --> 01:11:31,480
up to that school now
and start a fire.

1111
01:11:33,482 --> 01:11:34,775
Unless you do something,

1112
01:11:35,609 --> 01:11:37,295
there are going to be
a lot of innocent people

1113
01:11:37,319 --> 01:11:38,612
on both sides getting hurt.

1114
01:11:39,404 --> 01:11:41,198
So suppose we begin
by pressing charges.

1115
01:11:42,241 --> 01:11:43,909
What kind of charges?

1116
01:11:44,785 --> 01:11:46,536
What can we prove?
That my son is an idiot?

1117
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,913
A stupid coward, what else?

1118
01:11:48,914 --> 01:11:50,314
I told you, Stewart.
I'll handle it!

1119
01:11:55,671 --> 01:11:57,798
How come you're hanging
around down here, Barbara?

1120
01:11:59,508 --> 01:12:01,486
It wouldn't have anything to
do with Martin, would it?

1121
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:02,510
Martin?

1122
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,079
Listen, I'm going to go
for a swim.

1123
01:12:04,304 --> 01:12:05,944
But you stay off
that horse now, you hear?

1124
01:12:06,223 --> 01:12:07,432
Yes, Mama.

1125
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,935
How come you never
try to lay me?

1126
01:12:10,686 --> 01:12:11,937
That's a stupid question.

1127
01:12:13,272 --> 01:12:15,314
Don't cover up.
Are you afraid of me?

1128
01:12:15,315 --> 01:12:16,355
No, I'm not afraid of you.

1129
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:19,111
Then what?
Wasn't I good enough for you?

1130
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:21,654
I heard all Indian boys
want to go to bed

1131
01:12:21,655 --> 01:12:22,655
with white girls.

1132
01:12:23,907 --> 01:12:25,176
Don't believe
everything you hear.

1133
01:12:25,200 --> 01:12:27,034
But I know you want to.
I can tell.

1134
01:12:27,035 --> 01:12:28,036
How come you never tried?

1135
01:12:28,453 --> 01:12:30,205
Because you've always
been an anybody's...

1136
01:12:30,664 --> 01:12:31,832
What's an anybody's?

1137
01:12:32,332 --> 01:12:35,084
An anybody's is someone who puts
out so she can get dates or

1138
01:12:35,085 --> 01:12:36,085
be accepted.

1139
01:12:36,628 --> 01:12:38,046
I want you to experience
the fact

1140
01:12:38,213 --> 01:12:39,047
that I don't love you

1141
01:12:39,214 --> 01:12:40,494
because you'll give me some sex.

1142
01:12:41,550 --> 01:12:43,802
I love you for yourself and
for what you are.

1143
01:12:44,469 --> 01:12:47,306
You see you are very
soft and beautiful person

1144
01:12:47,806 --> 01:12:49,474
and I love you very much.

1145
01:12:57,733 --> 01:12:58,775
What's that?

1146
01:12:59,484 --> 01:13:01,403
It's a saying
by St. Francis of Assisi.

1147
01:13:02,487 --> 01:13:04,614
It's kind of dumb,
but go ahead and read it.

1148
01:13:05,699 --> 01:13:07,659
"Lord grant me this serenity"

1149
01:13:08,410 --> 01:13:10,746
to accept the things
I cannot change,

1150
01:13:11,913 --> 01:13:12,913
courage to change the

1151
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:16,501
things I can, and the wisdom
to know the difference.

1152
01:13:18,879 --> 01:13:22,841
My mother left that to me.
It was all she had.

1153
01:13:28,889 --> 01:13:30,015
I want you to have it.

1154
01:13:37,689 --> 01:13:41,734
Tell me, Dinosaur, why is it

1155
01:13:41,735 --> 01:13:44,654
when a guy hates his old man
as much as I do,

1156
01:13:45,822 --> 01:13:46,864
you still keep trying

1157
01:13:46,865 --> 01:13:48,950
to do that one thing
that he'll be proud of?

1158
01:13:49,576 --> 01:13:51,661
What makes you think
Billy is going to be by here?

1159
01:13:51,995 --> 01:13:53,789
I mean he could be in Africa
for all we know.

1160
01:14:02,756 --> 01:14:06,635
My God, Bernard! Look at that!

1161
01:14:17,104 --> 01:14:18,563
God-damn.

1162
01:14:24,444 --> 01:14:25,821
What are we going to do now?

1163
01:14:39,835 --> 01:14:44,631
One move, one sound,
one twitch of your eye lash,

1164
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:46,216
and you're dead.

1165
01:14:51,972 --> 01:14:52,972
Put your feet forward!

1166
01:14:57,352 --> 01:14:58,478
Hang on to the horn!

1167
01:15:07,988 --> 01:15:09,906
Y'know, for all my braggin'...

1168
01:15:11,450 --> 01:15:14,369
I never really been able to go
all the way with a girl.

1169
01:15:17,330 --> 01:15:20,250
What if I get all worked up
and can't finish it?

1170
01:15:33,346 --> 01:15:36,808
Hey, it was so funny when my
car went into the lake.

1171
01:15:37,517 --> 01:15:39,060
How come you're not
laughing now?

1172
01:15:40,854 --> 01:15:42,981
Martin? Have you found Jean yet?

1173
01:15:43,148 --> 01:15:44,868
- We've sent for her.
- You better hurry up.

1174
01:15:44,983 --> 01:15:46,823
I'm afraid Barbara is going
to loose that baby.

1175
01:15:47,694 --> 01:15:49,529
Bernard, this is
kidnapping and rape.

1176
01:15:50,363 --> 01:15:51,865
You stop now and I'll forget it.

1177
01:15:52,657 --> 01:15:55,075
You go on and I swear
that I'll see you in prison

1178
01:15:55,076 --> 01:15:56,243
for the rest of your life.

1179
01:15:56,244 --> 01:15:58,413
Not a chance.
You got no witnesses.

1180
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:01,373
Whose word do you think
my old man and the Sheriff

1181
01:16:01,374 --> 01:16:03,251
will believe anyway,
yours or ours?

1182
01:16:11,134 --> 01:16:12,761
Lousy rotten bitch!

1183
01:16:22,687 --> 01:16:24,731
You touch me again
and I will scream.

1184
01:16:25,607 --> 01:16:27,107
You let out one sound,

1185
01:16:27,108 --> 01:16:29,027
and I'll put a bullet
right in your mouth.

1186
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:32,280
Then you better pull
a trigger right now,

1187
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:36,618
because I would rather die
than have you touch me again.

1188
01:16:39,621 --> 01:16:41,081
Try Peer Lake.

1189
01:16:46,461 --> 01:16:48,461
You know part of me doesn't
really want to do this.

1190
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:49,710
Then let's get out of here.

1191
01:17:12,654 --> 01:17:18,535
Billy! Kit! They're
down here! Help! Billy!

1192
01:17:19,744 --> 01:17:20,996
Race you, man.

1193
01:17:21,204 --> 01:17:22,372
Lets get out of here.

1194
01:17:36,428 --> 01:17:38,471
I pray Billy kills him.

1195
01:17:40,557 --> 01:17:42,225
You mustn't tell Billy, Cindy.

1196
01:17:42,892 --> 01:17:43,893
Why not?

1197
01:17:44,811 --> 01:17:46,187
Because he will kill him.

1198
01:17:46,813 --> 01:17:48,607
Damn your pacifism!

1199
01:17:48,815 --> 01:17:52,694
I am not going to let that
sick animal get away with this!

1200
01:17:54,946 --> 01:17:58,742
He has gotten away with it.

1201
01:17:59,451 --> 01:18:05,123
Even if Billy kills him,
kills them all,

1202
01:18:05,373 --> 01:18:08,209
it wouldn't change
what's happened here today.

1203
01:18:11,254 --> 01:18:13,298
He wouldn't take away
any of the horror.

1204
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:25,810
It will just destroy
a lot of innocent kids.

1205
01:18:28,855 --> 01:18:30,523
Can't you understand that?

1206
01:18:33,234 --> 01:18:36,029
My religion, my non-violence...

1207
01:18:37,447 --> 01:18:40,784
the kids, that's all I have
left now.

1208
01:18:51,127 --> 01:18:53,254
If you rob me of this chance...

1209
01:18:55,799 --> 01:18:59,302
if I can't really
turn the other cheek...

1210
01:19:00,595 --> 01:19:02,472
when I can help
the kids the most...

1211
01:19:05,725 --> 01:19:09,521
then I couldn't endure
what happened here today.

1212
01:19:17,028 --> 01:19:20,949
And if they took
the school away,

1213
01:19:21,491 --> 01:19:25,829
I just couldn't live
with what happened here.

1214
01:19:27,455 --> 01:19:30,625
Please, Cindy, please.

1215
01:19:54,983 --> 01:19:57,944
Hey, what happened?

1216
01:19:59,237 --> 01:20:02,699
I guess she got thrown when she
was doing some trick riding.

1217
01:20:07,036 --> 01:20:08,371
What else is wrong?

1218
01:20:12,834 --> 01:20:14,919
Come on, I've never seen you
act so strange.

1219
01:20:16,504 --> 01:20:18,506
I guess I'm just upset
about Barbara.

1220
01:20:34,647 --> 01:20:37,192
It was a boy. White.

1221
01:20:38,485 --> 01:20:39,485
We lost it.

1222
01:21:54,769 --> 01:21:58,106
Martin, do you know what
mental toughness is?

1223
01:22:00,608 --> 01:22:02,359
Well, mental toughness
is the ability

1224
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:04,695
to accept the fact
that you're human, and that

1225
01:22:04,696 --> 01:22:07,448
your going to make mistakes.
Lots of 'em. All your life.

1226
01:22:08,741 --> 01:22:10,826
And some of them are going
to hurt people

1227
01:22:10,827 --> 01:22:13,912
that you love very badly,
but you have the guts

1228
01:22:13,913 --> 01:22:15,707
to accept the fact
that you're imperfect,

1229
01:22:15,874 --> 01:22:17,417
and you
don't let your mistakes crush

1230
01:22:17,584 --> 01:22:20,461
you and keep you from doing
the very best that you can.

1231
01:22:21,713 --> 01:22:22,993
A lot of good I could have done.

1232
01:22:23,798 --> 01:22:24,798
You sure could have.

1233
01:22:26,217 --> 01:22:28,720
You could've gone inside and
comforted that girl

1234
01:22:28,887 --> 01:22:30,137
instead of sitting
out in the porch

1235
01:22:30,138 --> 01:22:33,141
whining, feeling so sorry for
yourself.

1236
01:22:37,562 --> 01:22:39,730
And the only reason they
cremated it was to keep us

1237
01:22:39,731 --> 01:22:41,566
from knowing that it was
that Indian's kid.

1238
01:22:42,108 --> 01:22:43,359
It was not an Indian.

1239
01:22:43,526 --> 01:22:45,862
I told you, I handled it.
It was a white foetus.

1240
01:22:47,238 --> 01:22:48,823
You're a goddamn liar.

1241
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:55,121
Come on, now, Mike. I don't have
to listen to that from you.

1242
01:23:02,879 --> 01:23:04,422
The hell you don't.

1243
01:23:08,885 --> 01:23:10,637
Did you know Barbara
was at that school?

1244
01:23:16,684 --> 01:23:20,855
What the hell. I can see
this is going no place.

1245
01:23:22,190 --> 01:23:27,153
Doc! Did Cole know
she was at the school?

1246
01:23:38,623 --> 01:23:39,623
You guys wait.

1247
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:42,590
Just wait until it happens
to one of your kids.

1248
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:44,796
Well, now... I don't
think we ought to wait.

1249
01:23:47,131 --> 01:23:47,799
Jean?

1250
01:23:47,966 --> 01:23:48,633
Yeah...

1251
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:49,384
Telephone.

1252
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:50,550
Thank you.

1253
01:23:51,094 --> 01:23:52,094
Come on, you guys!

1254
01:23:52,095 --> 01:23:54,931
Star Spangled Banner group get
out here! Places! Come on...

1255
01:23:55,932 --> 01:23:56,765
Hello?

1256
01:23:56,766 --> 01:23:58,976
Jean, I'm afraid
it's really bad.

1257
01:23:58,977 --> 01:24:00,395
Nobody is going to
show up tonight.

1258
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:01,770
Why not?

1259
01:24:01,813 --> 01:24:03,398
It's Posner and the deputy.

1260
01:24:03,690 --> 01:24:06,484
Seems they are up to something
very stupid and crazy.

1261
01:25:08,087 --> 01:25:10,548
Don't get out of your
cars, boys.

1262
01:25:11,007 --> 01:25:12,767
I don't even want to know
who any of you are.

1263
01:25:12,925 --> 01:25:14,653
Now the only trouble we're
going to have here tonight

1264
01:25:14,677 --> 01:25:16,095
if you are trying
to get past me.

1265
01:25:16,345 --> 01:25:17,388
What do you want to do?

1266
01:25:19,265 --> 01:25:20,558
Inch forward.

1267
01:25:26,522 --> 01:25:27,522
You all know me,

1268
01:25:28,733 --> 01:25:30,533
and you know I'm not going
to let this happen.

1269
01:25:31,861 --> 01:25:34,572
Now you just turn around
and go on back home.

1270
01:25:35,198 --> 01:25:37,282
Every night Martin
goes down to the barn

1271
01:25:37,283 --> 01:25:38,283
to feed the horses,

1272
01:25:38,409 --> 01:25:39,827
why don't we grab him
and hold him

1273
01:25:39,994 --> 01:25:41,579
until they give you
Barbara back?

1274
01:25:55,343 --> 01:25:57,260
- Cindy?
- Yes.

1275
01:25:57,261 --> 01:25:59,061
Go down to the barn and
get Martin, would you?

1276
01:25:59,097 --> 01:26:00,097
Okay.

1277
01:26:01,349 --> 01:26:03,726
Martin... come out come out
wherever you are.

1278
01:26:09,273 --> 01:26:10,273
Stop it!

1279
01:26:11,192 --> 01:26:13,319
I thought I told you
to leave him alone.

1280
01:26:13,653 --> 01:26:15,173
I was just giving
the pacifist a chance

1281
01:26:15,321 --> 01:26:16,321
to turn the other cheek.

1282
01:26:23,871 --> 01:26:25,998
Look, Jean, if I knew
where they were holding him,

1283
01:26:26,165 --> 01:26:27,166
I'd go there right away,

1284
01:26:27,333 --> 01:26:28,708
but at this point
they don't trust me

1285
01:26:28,709 --> 01:26:29,749
any more than they do you.

1286
01:26:29,836 --> 01:26:31,963
I couldn't possibly turn
her over to that man.

1287
01:26:32,130 --> 01:26:33,130
Why not?

1288
01:26:33,506 --> 01:26:35,526
She can just run away again
right after she gets there,

1289
01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:37,342
and in the meantime,
the boy will be safe.

1290
01:26:37,343 --> 01:26:38,802
Cole, you know damn well

1291
01:26:38,803 --> 01:26:40,304
that Posner will never
hurt that boy.

1292
01:26:40,513 --> 01:26:41,833
Wouldn't you arrest him
if he did?

1293
01:26:41,889 --> 01:26:42,806
Sure I'd arrest him,

1294
01:26:42,807 --> 01:26:45,268
but we can't get a conviction
in this town and you know it.

1295
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:47,019
I'm going back with you.

1296
01:26:47,645 --> 01:26:50,231
He's right. As long as I stay
here, anything can happen.

1297
01:26:50,648 --> 01:26:52,567
As soon as Martin's safe,
I can split again.

1298
01:26:55,862 --> 01:26:56,946
What can I say?

1299
01:27:01,576 --> 01:27:02,952
All right, Buck. Where is she?

1300
01:27:07,206 --> 01:27:08,332
WHERE IS SHE?

1301
01:27:17,049 --> 01:27:18,049
Leave him alone!

1302
01:27:19,343 --> 01:27:20,463
She can't pull that trigger.

1303
01:27:20,761 --> 01:27:23,055
You release that boy,
or I swear I'll shoot!

1304
01:27:25,683 --> 01:27:26,767
I swear it!

1305
01:27:28,728 --> 01:27:30,104
Please, don't make me shoot you!

1306
01:27:30,313 --> 01:27:33,940
Now, look miss, do you have
the courage to shoot a man

1307
01:27:33,941 --> 01:27:35,341
that's looking you
right in the eye?

1308
01:27:35,693 --> 01:27:36,933
Please don't make me shoot you.

1309
01:27:38,863 --> 01:27:39,863
Please!

1310
01:27:45,119 --> 01:27:46,119
Look out!

1311
01:27:49,165 --> 01:27:50,166
Martin, get in the truck.

1312
01:27:55,379 --> 01:27:56,421
Okay. Come on, get in.

1313
01:27:56,422 --> 01:27:57,423
No, they'll follow you.

1314
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:58,966
I can't leave without you.

1315
01:27:59,133 --> 01:28:00,468
Martin, get going.

1316
01:28:00,801 --> 01:28:02,177
As soon as you're gone,
it's all over.

1317
01:28:02,178 --> 01:28:03,262
Now go back to the school.

1318
01:28:03,554 --> 01:28:04,138
I can't.

1319
01:28:04,472 --> 01:28:06,015
Martin, please get going.

1320
01:28:12,605 --> 01:28:13,981
All right Bernard, go get him!

1321
01:28:23,407 --> 01:28:24,784
Careful! He's armed!

1322
01:28:28,037 --> 01:28:29,247
Billy's gone after Martin!

1323
01:28:29,413 --> 01:28:30,790
Lord, no.

1324
01:29:10,037 --> 01:29:11,455
Well, I'll be damned!

1325
01:29:12,248 --> 01:29:13,708
That injun is shootin' back.

1326
01:29:14,959 --> 01:29:16,002
Take her home.

1327
01:29:16,877 --> 01:29:19,754
No, sir. Not until we get
Martin back.

1328
01:29:19,755 --> 01:29:21,132
She's all the insurance
I've got.

1329
01:29:27,096 --> 01:29:28,180
Where's Martin?

1330
01:29:31,851 --> 01:29:33,394
I said, where's Martin?

1331
01:29:33,936 --> 01:29:34,687
He got away.

1332
01:29:34,895 --> 01:29:35,895
Hold it!

1333
01:29:37,690 --> 01:29:39,290
Now you drop that gun,
or I'll shoot her.

1334
01:29:43,446 --> 01:29:44,613
I'm not gonna ask you again.

1335
01:29:48,617 --> 01:29:49,660
You won't have to.

1336
01:29:50,661 --> 01:29:51,661
What?

1337
01:29:52,246 --> 01:29:53,331
I said shoot her.

1338
01:29:57,918 --> 01:29:59,170
You'd kill her, just like that?

1339
01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:01,756
You'll kill her.

1340
01:30:03,507 --> 01:30:06,594
And then I'll kill you,
just like that.

1341
01:30:10,139 --> 01:30:11,299
I'm itching to kill somebody,

1342
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:12,850
so it might just as well be you.

1343
01:30:13,768 --> 01:30:14,810
Pull the trigger...

1344
01:30:24,028 --> 01:30:25,548
I wasn't going to hurt
the little girl.

1345
01:30:26,781 --> 01:30:28,908
You knew it all the time,
didn't you, Buck?

1346
01:30:31,619 --> 01:30:34,205
All right, Cindy. Get on.

1347
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:38,959
Did you see anyone with a gun?

1348
01:30:39,293 --> 01:30:40,835
I only heard the shots.

1349
01:30:40,836 --> 01:30:42,087
Yeah, then what happened?

1350
01:30:42,088 --> 01:30:43,464
I saw a Corvette pull out.

1351
01:30:44,590 --> 01:30:45,841
Where did the shots come from?

1352
01:30:46,175 --> 01:30:47,176
Came from over there.

1353
01:31:13,411 --> 01:31:14,411
Was he shot?

1354
01:31:15,746 --> 01:31:16,872
Four times.

1355
01:31:17,623 --> 01:31:18,623
In the head.

1356
01:31:20,292 --> 01:31:22,336
I'll give you 24 hours
to bring him in, Stuart.

1357
01:31:24,463 --> 01:31:25,663
And then I'm coming after him.

1358
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:27,258
Cole, the girl is gone.

1359
01:31:37,726 --> 01:31:38,726
It's my fault.

1360
01:31:40,563 --> 01:31:44,775
It is my fault.
If I'd have said something,

1361
01:31:45,109 --> 01:31:46,389
Martin wouldn't have had to die.

1362
01:31:46,569 --> 01:31:47,689
If you would have said what?

1363
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,440
You're not making any sense.

1364
01:31:49,738 --> 01:31:50,738
Cindy!

1365
01:31:51,782 --> 01:31:54,118
If she would have told me
that Bernard raped Jean.

1366
01:31:55,536 --> 01:31:56,579
How did you know?

1367
01:31:58,247 --> 01:31:59,247
I didn't.

1368
01:32:04,378 --> 01:32:05,546
Billy, please!

1369
01:32:06,547 --> 01:32:08,298
We haven't crossed over
that thin line yet,

1370
01:32:08,299 --> 01:32:09,776
but if you kill Bernard,
you'll be doing

1371
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,136
just what they want.
Can't you see that?

1372
01:32:13,262 --> 01:32:15,347
You just can't keep making
your own laws.

1373
01:32:15,848 --> 01:32:17,974
There's got to be one
set of laws fair for everyone,

1374
01:32:17,975 --> 01:32:19,142
including you.

1375
01:32:19,143 --> 01:32:19,768
That's fine.

1376
01:32:19,977 --> 01:32:21,853
When that set of laws
is fairly applied to everyone,

1377
01:32:21,854 --> 01:32:23,272
then I'll turn
the other cheek, too.

1378
01:32:23,898 --> 01:32:26,274
There's got to be a better
way to change those people.

1379
01:32:26,275 --> 01:32:27,484
To change those people?

1380
01:32:27,485 --> 01:32:28,503
You worked with King,
didn't you?

1381
01:32:28,527 --> 01:32:29,527
- Yes.
- Where is he?

1382
01:32:29,528 --> 01:32:31,237
- Dead.
- Where is Bob and Jack Kennedy?

1383
01:32:31,238 --> 01:32:32,071
- Dead.
- Not dead.

1384
01:32:32,072 --> 01:32:33,364
Their brains blown out

1385
01:32:33,365 --> 01:32:34,699
because your people
wouldn't even put the same

1386
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:36,910
controls on their guns
as they do on their dogs,

1387
01:32:36,911 --> 01:32:38,536
their bicycles, their cats,
and their automobiles.

1388
01:32:38,537 --> 01:32:40,955
I don't care about all that!

1389
01:32:40,956 --> 01:32:42,917
I just don't want you to go
out and commit murder.

1390
01:32:46,629 --> 01:32:48,297
Please, Billy, please.

1391
01:32:49,298 --> 01:32:50,590
We'll go someplace else.

1392
01:32:50,591 --> 01:32:52,471
Someplace where it doesn't
have to be like this.

1393
01:32:52,635 --> 01:32:53,635
Really?

1394
01:32:53,677 --> 01:32:55,763
You tell me where is
that place, where is it?

1395
01:32:56,013 --> 01:32:57,764
In what remote corner
of this country...

1396
01:32:57,765 --> 01:32:59,391
No, the entire goddamn planet...

1397
01:32:59,558 --> 01:33:01,351
Is there such a place
where men really care about

1398
01:33:01,352 --> 01:33:02,811
another and really love each
other?

1399
01:33:03,103 --> 01:33:05,303
Now you tell me where such a
place is, and I promise you

1400
01:33:05,356 --> 01:33:07,676
that I'll never hurt another
human being as long as I live.

1401
01:33:07,942 --> 01:33:09,193
Just one place?

1402
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:16,116
That's what I thought.

1403
01:33:23,374 --> 01:33:24,917
I'll be back for Barbara.

1404
01:33:48,732 --> 01:33:50,192
How old are you?

1405
01:33:51,610 --> 01:33:52,610
13.

1406
01:33:53,946 --> 01:33:55,072
Get out.

1407
01:34:28,439 --> 01:34:30,691
Search warrant Federal,
search warrant State,

1408
01:34:31,108 --> 01:34:32,359
search warrant County,

1409
01:34:32,610 --> 01:34:34,236
And a court order
demanding that Barbara

1410
01:34:34,403 --> 01:34:36,381
be turned over to the court
pending an investigation

1411
01:34:36,405 --> 01:34:38,198
into her father's fitness
as a parent.

1412
01:34:39,450 --> 01:34:41,201
Come on, let's get out of here.

1413
01:34:45,664 --> 01:34:46,664
What do you want to do?

1414
01:34:46,915 --> 01:34:47,915
Go with you.

1415
01:34:49,209 --> 01:34:50,209
We can try.

1416
01:35:33,962 --> 01:35:36,002
All right, tell him I'll
take care of it right away.

1417
01:35:36,131 --> 01:35:37,883
Well, it went out over
the wire services.

1418
01:35:38,050 --> 01:35:39,426
It's a big story now.

1419
01:35:39,593 --> 01:35:40,612
The governor is sending someone

1420
01:35:40,636 --> 01:35:41,761
to take personal charge.

1421
01:35:41,762 --> 01:35:43,448
He wants everything
frozen till he gets here.

1422
01:35:43,472 --> 01:35:44,912
We've cornered him
in the old church.

1423
01:35:45,265 --> 01:35:46,599
He's killed Mike.

1424
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:47,600
No.

1425
01:35:56,402 --> 01:35:58,112
What are we going to do, Jean?

1426
01:35:58,362 --> 01:36:00,155
He'll die before he'll
give himself up.

1427
01:36:00,989 --> 01:36:03,367
Can you talk to him? Try?

1428
01:36:05,327 --> 01:36:06,870
You never told me
what's in that thing.

1429
01:36:09,707 --> 01:36:10,749
It's my medicine bag.

1430
01:36:11,625 --> 01:36:16,213
Got some owl's feathers,
sacred corn, snake teeth.

1431
01:36:17,256 --> 01:36:18,382
What's it for?

1432
01:36:20,050 --> 01:36:21,093
Contains my power.

1433
01:36:21,510 --> 01:36:24,388
Without it I'd be outside of
the flow of life's forces.

1434
01:36:25,764 --> 01:36:27,474
Like Samson without his hair?

1435
01:36:28,142 --> 01:36:29,476
You got it.

1436
01:36:29,893 --> 01:36:31,812
Billy! Billy Jack!

1437
01:36:32,062 --> 01:36:33,397
Can you hear me?

1438
01:36:34,606 --> 01:36:36,358
Jean is coming in to
talk to you.

1439
01:36:36,942 --> 01:36:39,944
It's no trick. No one will
try to sneak up on you.

1440
01:36:39,945 --> 01:36:41,363
She just wants to talk to you.

1441
01:36:58,881 --> 01:37:00,715
I don't suppose
you care too much

1442
01:37:00,716 --> 01:37:01,916
that you're bleeding to death.

1443
01:37:03,302 --> 01:37:05,512
Everything they want
from here on out,

1444
01:37:07,347 --> 01:37:09,224
they're gonna have to take.

1445
01:37:10,559 --> 01:37:12,144
You don't understand that,
do you?

1446
01:37:14,563 --> 01:37:15,563
No.

1447
01:37:18,942 --> 01:37:22,529
I only know you can't solve
everything by violence, Billy.

1448
01:37:48,472 --> 01:37:49,932
They'll kill you, Billy.

1449
01:37:52,267 --> 01:37:55,187
I wish there was something
I could say to change all that.

1450
01:38:03,445 --> 01:38:05,489
I know I've never said it
to you,

1451
01:38:08,659 --> 01:38:10,077
but I think you know.

1452
01:38:12,162 --> 01:38:13,455
I love you.

1453
01:38:18,377 --> 01:38:20,212
I think you know too.

1454
01:38:28,053 --> 01:38:33,267
It just seems so insane that we
have to go living without you.

1455
01:38:38,730 --> 01:38:40,440
What about Barbara?

1456
01:38:41,733 --> 01:38:42,901
It's up to her to decide.

1457
01:38:44,528 --> 01:38:46,154
Barbara,
will you go out with me?

1458
01:38:46,780 --> 01:38:47,780
No.

1459
01:38:48,407 --> 01:38:49,658
May I ask why?

1460
01:38:50,617 --> 01:38:52,785
From the day I was
born till this moment,

1461
01:38:52,786 --> 01:38:54,580
and every second in between,

1462
01:38:55,455 --> 01:38:57,833
life has just been one
big shit brick.

1463
01:38:59,126 --> 01:39:00,919
I just can't take it anymore.

1464
01:39:02,713 --> 01:39:04,047
The way things are going,

1465
01:39:06,258 --> 01:39:09,052
well as the Indians say, today
is as good as any to die.

1466
01:39:13,140 --> 01:39:14,474
You've taught her well.

1467
01:39:15,601 --> 01:39:17,561
An Indian isn't afraid to die.

1468
01:39:18,186 --> 01:39:20,522
Don't ever expect a white man
to understand that.

1469
01:39:21,231 --> 01:39:25,319
I understand it. That's
good for an Indian.

1470
01:39:26,737 --> 01:39:28,405
Like the old man said,

1471
01:39:28,614 --> 01:39:30,657
being an Indian is not
a matter of blood.

1472
01:39:31,783 --> 01:39:32,783
It's a way of life.

1473
01:39:33,952 --> 01:39:35,203
I understand that, too.

1474
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:38,497
She's a 15-year-old child

1475
01:39:38,498 --> 01:39:40,250
who worships the ground
you walk on,

1476
01:39:41,084 --> 01:39:43,169
and now she's going
to die needlessly

1477
01:39:43,170 --> 01:39:45,964
because you haven't got
the guts to control your temper.

1478
01:39:50,344 --> 01:39:52,930
It's so easy for you
to die dramatically.

1479
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:54,889
It's a hell of a
lot tougher for those

1480
01:39:54,890 --> 01:39:56,725
of us who have to
keep on trying.

1481
01:40:16,370 --> 01:40:17,537
Stay back there!

1482
01:40:17,704 --> 01:40:18,704
Hello, Charlie. How are you?

1483
01:40:18,705 --> 01:40:19,745
Jim, what's the situation?

1484
01:40:19,831 --> 01:40:21,311
He's barricaded himself
in the church.

1485
01:40:21,458 --> 01:40:23,209
We've got to make
every effort to take him alive.

1486
01:40:23,210 --> 01:40:23,835
No way.

1487
01:40:24,086 --> 01:40:26,088
Hell, he's only one man.
It shouldn't be too tough.

1488
01:40:26,254 --> 01:40:27,505
What do you mean no way?

1489
01:40:27,506 --> 01:40:28,839
Why can't you just
move on in there

1490
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,633
and take him with some
cover fire, and bring him on

1491
01:40:30,634 --> 01:40:31,676
out with some tear gas?

1492
01:40:31,677 --> 01:40:32,885
You've got a whole army here.

1493
01:40:32,886 --> 01:40:33,886
No way.

1494
01:40:34,221 --> 01:40:35,012
Can you do it?

1495
01:40:35,013 --> 01:40:36,013
Well do it.

1496
01:41:10,173 --> 01:41:12,050
- Get down!
- I want to help load.

1497
01:41:12,259 --> 01:41:15,302
Put your head up and I'll
knock it off. Now get down!

1498
01:41:34,031 --> 01:41:35,031
Stay down!

1499
01:41:59,431 --> 01:42:01,224
Pull back! Pull back!

1500
01:42:01,808 --> 01:42:03,643
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1501
01:42:04,186 --> 01:42:07,731
Cease fire! Pull back.

1502
01:42:10,609 --> 01:42:14,071
Okay. You can come out now.

1503
01:42:14,321 --> 01:42:15,822
I don't think I can.

1504
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:26,208
This dying stuff's not all
it's cracked up to be.

1505
01:42:26,875 --> 01:42:29,711
You crazy nut.

1506
01:42:41,306 --> 01:42:42,641
Don't let them take me.

1507
01:42:42,974 --> 01:42:45,268
You don't even have
a medicine bag,

1508
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:47,813
so how can it be your
day to die?

1509
01:42:48,313 --> 01:42:49,606
You're going, period.

1510
01:42:50,315 --> 01:42:53,526
It's just that if you die,

1511
01:42:53,527 --> 01:42:55,278
that'll kill Jean,
the school, and

1512
01:42:55,445 --> 01:42:56,988
everything she lives for.

1513
01:42:59,032 --> 01:43:00,116
And if you love her,

1514
01:43:00,117 --> 01:43:01,557
I don't see why you'd
do that to her.

1515
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:08,040
That's all.

1516
01:43:27,060 --> 01:43:29,980
Got to take him alive.
Where's that girl?

1517
01:43:30,689 --> 01:43:32,691
She's already been
in there several times.

1518
01:43:32,983 --> 01:43:35,109
Well, then send her
in there several more times.

1519
01:43:35,110 --> 01:43:37,320
Maybe a couple of us ought
to go in with her this time.

1520
01:43:44,035 --> 01:43:45,035
Hey, Billy!

1521
01:43:49,833 --> 01:43:53,879
We're not armed. No tricks.
You have my word.

1522
01:43:57,883 --> 01:43:58,883
Come ahead.

1523
01:44:02,554 --> 01:44:04,306
But you will get a fair trial,

1524
01:44:05,223 --> 01:44:06,765
because the whole world
will have reporters

1525
01:44:06,766 --> 01:44:08,018
here watching it.

1526
01:44:08,476 --> 01:44:10,312
And because a lot of
politicians will realize

1527
01:44:10,520 --> 01:44:12,731
it's in their own selfish
interest to at least go

1528
01:44:12,898 --> 01:44:14,900
through the form of
giving you a fair trial.

1529
01:44:15,275 --> 01:44:16,026
But in the meantime,

1530
01:44:16,193 --> 01:44:18,153
you will have accomplished
an awful lot of good.

1531
01:44:20,614 --> 01:44:21,614
Like what?

1532
01:44:22,532 --> 01:44:23,782
Like calling attention

1533
01:44:23,783 --> 01:44:26,493
to the unbelievably horrible
way that the Indian is cheated

1534
01:44:26,494 --> 01:44:28,038
and forced to live
in this country.

1535
01:44:28,371 --> 01:44:30,498
And the stupid insensitivity
of Washington,

1536
01:44:30,665 --> 01:44:32,000
the whole damn Indian bureau.

1537
01:44:32,751 --> 01:44:35,003
For God's sake, Billy, you
get yourself killed now,

1538
01:44:35,170 --> 01:44:37,130
it's a headline in tomorrow's
paper and that's it.

1539
01:44:37,839 --> 01:44:39,007
But if you go to trial,

1540
01:44:39,299 --> 01:44:41,301
millions of people will learn
what's happening.

1541
01:44:41,593 --> 01:44:42,844
Like you just said,

1542
01:44:44,179 --> 01:44:46,306
still not
a damn thing will be done.

1543
01:44:46,598 --> 01:44:47,891
What about the school?

1544
01:44:48,683 --> 01:44:50,851
Could we get enough money
and freedom to run it

1545
01:44:50,852 --> 01:44:52,979
for the next five years
without interference?

1546
01:44:53,188 --> 01:44:54,564
They'll give you that
in a minute.

1547
01:44:55,106 --> 01:44:56,106
In writing?

1548
01:44:56,441 --> 01:44:57,441
I'm sure they would.

1549
01:44:59,069 --> 01:45:00,069
It's funny, isn't it?

1550
01:45:00,779 --> 01:45:03,240
Only the white man wants
everything put in writing,

1551
01:45:04,199 --> 01:45:06,826
and only then so he can
use it against you in court.

1552
01:45:08,495 --> 01:45:11,206
You know, among the Indians,
a promise is good enough.

1553
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:16,210
As far as I can tell,

1554
01:45:16,211 --> 01:45:20,173
Washington entered into 3,500
treaties with the Indians

1555
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:25,845
to date, and they've broken
about 3,499.

1556
01:45:26,429 --> 01:45:27,597
I agree with you, Billy.

1557
01:45:27,847 --> 01:45:29,307
Promises haven't meant
very much.

1558
01:45:30,392 --> 01:45:31,726
But this is one they'll keep.

1559
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:33,979
The important point is this.

1560
01:45:34,813 --> 01:45:36,022
If you have to go out,

1561
01:45:36,273 --> 01:45:38,073
you might as well make it
count for something.

1562
01:45:44,114 --> 01:45:46,741
Well, I can't think of
anything else to say.

1563
01:45:49,953 --> 01:45:55,667
Tell them that I'll give them
an answer in the morning.

1564
01:46:11,141 --> 01:46:12,642
We're different, you and I.

1565
01:46:16,563 --> 01:46:21,108
Your spirit is more calm
and pacific in you

1566
01:46:21,109 --> 01:46:23,028
than any person
I have ever known.

1567
01:46:27,407 --> 01:46:31,286
And mine has been in a violent
rage from the day I was born.

1568
01:46:37,334 --> 01:46:38,334
And you know something?

1569
01:46:44,758 --> 01:46:46,593
I didn't really want it
that way.

1570
01:46:48,887 --> 01:46:51,306
Billy, that's a bunch of crap.

1571
01:46:52,682 --> 01:46:54,934
I'm no different than you.

1572
01:46:56,144 --> 01:46:59,230
Do you think when Bernard
was on top of me,

1573
01:46:59,981 --> 01:47:02,525
grunting and slobbering,
I didn't hate?

1574
01:47:03,443 --> 01:47:07,197
I hated more than anybody else
on this earth ever hated.

1575
01:47:08,990 --> 01:47:12,452
And every time that picture
pops in to my mind,

1576
01:47:12,869 --> 01:47:15,205
I... whoo...

1577
01:47:16,373 --> 01:47:18,541
I've never hated so much
in my life.

1578
01:47:19,626 --> 01:47:23,546
When I think of that,
I dismember and I mangled,

1579
01:47:24,297 --> 01:47:27,257
and I castrate Bernard
over and over and over

1580
01:47:27,258 --> 01:47:28,635
and over in my mind.

1581
01:47:29,427 --> 01:47:31,679
At least a million times a day.

1582
01:47:35,809 --> 01:47:37,102
The bad part is,

1583
01:47:38,478 --> 01:47:40,188
even though he's dead...

1584
01:47:42,023 --> 01:47:43,733
I couldn't tell you.

1585
01:47:44,818 --> 01:47:46,694
You had to get your hate out.

1586
01:47:47,779 --> 01:47:49,572
I had to keep mine in.

1587
01:47:50,990 --> 01:47:52,617
I knew what you'd do.

1588
01:47:54,411 --> 01:47:57,080
But I knew how important
it was to the kids.

1589
01:47:58,873 --> 01:48:01,626
And I knew that their lives
and their needs

1590
01:48:02,585 --> 01:48:05,296
were more important
than any hate I had.

1591
01:48:07,006 --> 01:48:09,342
They're more important
than killing Bernard.

1592
01:48:10,885 --> 01:48:11,886
But maybe...

1593
01:48:16,558 --> 01:48:18,309
maybe if I had told you...

1594
01:48:21,187 --> 01:48:23,231
Martin may... might be alive now.

1595
01:48:28,027 --> 01:48:29,446
I don't know.

1596
01:48:37,287 --> 01:48:39,372
I don't know anymore.

1597
01:48:52,177 --> 01:48:54,428
First, the school be
guaranteed to operate

1598
01:48:54,429 --> 01:48:56,848
for the next ten years
without any interference,

1599
01:48:57,265 --> 01:49:00,059
and that I be given a ten-year
contract as directress.

1600
01:49:00,977 --> 01:49:03,270
Second, that
Barbara be put in my custody

1601
01:49:03,271 --> 01:49:04,271
as her legal guardian.

1602
01:49:06,524 --> 01:49:07,524
That's all he wants?

1603
01:49:07,609 --> 01:49:09,693
No, he also wants you
to guarantee

1604
01:49:09,694 --> 01:49:11,820
that someone from the governor's
office will hold

1605
01:49:11,821 --> 01:49:13,156
a press conference every year

1606
01:49:13,323 --> 01:49:14,991
to report on the progress
of the school.

1607
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:16,451
Hell, he's got it.

1608
01:49:16,826 --> 01:49:19,306
Call Washington. See if they'll
honor their end of the bargain.

1609
01:49:23,833 --> 01:49:25,668
Some lawyer
from the East called.

1610
01:49:28,713 --> 01:49:30,924
He wants to defend you free.

1611
01:49:58,326 --> 01:50:03,039
I know to let them
handcuff you...

1612
01:50:04,999 --> 01:50:07,460
close you in, and lock you up

1613
01:50:09,003 --> 01:50:11,631
is by far the hardest thing
you've ever done.

1614
01:50:14,801 --> 01:50:16,469
And I know that you're only
doing it

1615
01:50:17,262 --> 01:50:19,722
because of the love
you have for the kids...

1616
01:50:21,307 --> 01:50:22,308
and me.

1617
01:50:39,867 --> 01:50:41,286
Washington says okay, Billy.

1618
01:50:41,786 --> 01:50:44,289
I love you, Billy.

1619
01:50:45,331 --> 01:50:53,331
You've got a deal!
