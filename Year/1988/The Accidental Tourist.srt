1
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,088
<i>The business traveler should bring
only what fits in a carry on bag.</i>

2
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:59,092
<i>Checking your luggage
is asking for trouble.</i>

3
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:12,355
<i>Add several travel-size packets
of detergent...</i>

4
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:16,318
<i>...so you won't fall into the hands
of unfamiliar laundries.</i>

5
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:19,029
<i>There are very few necessities
in this world...</i>

6
00:01:19,196 --> 00:01:22,616
<i>...which do not come
in travel-size packets.</i>

7
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,791
<i>One suit is plenty...</i>

8
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:34,712
<i>...if you take along travel-size packets
of spot remover.</i>

9
00:01:34,878 --> 00:01:36,797
<i>The suit should be medium gray.</i>

10
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:42,345
<i>Gray not only hides the dirt
but is handy for sudden funerals.</i>

11
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:52,897
<i>Always bring a book
as protection against strangers.</i>

12
00:01:53,064 --> 00:01:54,356
<i>Magazines don't last...</i>

13
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:58,986
<i>...and newspapers from elsewhere
remind you you don't belong.</i>

14
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:01,238
<i>But don't take more than one book.</i>

15
00:02:01,406 --> 00:02:05,493
<i>It is a common mistake to overestimate
one's potential free time...</i>

16
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,705
<i>...and consequently over-pack.</i>

17
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:14,210
<i>In travel, as in most of life,
less is invariably more.</i>

18
00:02:16,963 --> 00:02:20,842
<i>And most importantly, never take
along anything on your journey...</i>

19
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:24,429
<i>...so valuable or dear...</i>

20
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:29,518
<i>...that its loss would devastate you.</i>

21
00:02:46,117 --> 00:02:49,497
- Sir, would you like a snack?
- Just some peanuts.

22
00:02:49,705 --> 00:02:51,498
I'm sorry I'm so fat.

23
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:53,875
Name's Lucas Loomis.

24
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:58,047
Macon Leary.

25
00:02:58,214 --> 00:03:00,674
You a Baltimore man?

26
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,386
- Yes.
- Me too.

27
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,055
Greatest city on the Earth.

28
00:03:06,472 --> 00:03:09,058
One of these seats
is not really enough for me.

29
00:03:09,225 --> 00:03:12,311
The stupid thing is,
I travel for a living.

30
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:16,315
I demonstrate software
to computer stores.

31
00:03:16,483 --> 00:03:18,567
What do you do, Mr. Leary?

32
00:03:18,735 --> 00:03:20,861
I write travel guidebooks.

33
00:03:21,112 --> 00:03:22,905
Is that so? What kind?

34
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:26,659
Well, guides for businessmen...

35
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:29,829
...people just like you, I guess.

36
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:32,916
<i>Accidental Tourist.</i>

37
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:36,670
- Why, yes.
- Really? Am I right?

38
00:03:36,836 --> 00:03:39,673
Well, what do you know?
Look at this:

39
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,384
Gray suit. Just what you recommend.

40
00:03:42,592 --> 00:03:45,262
Appropriate for all occasions.

41
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:47,180
See my luggage?

42
00:03:47,346 --> 00:03:51,768
Carry on. Change of underwear,
clean shirt, packet of detergent powder.

43
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:54,813
- Oh, good.
- You're my hero.

44
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:58,525
You've improved my trips 100 percent.

45
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:04,114
I tell my wife, Going with the Accidental
Tourist is like going in a cocoon.

46
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:06,033
Well, this is very nice to hear.

47
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,454
Times I've flown clear to Oregon
and hardly knew I left Baltimore.

48
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:12,748
Excellent.

49
00:04:13,623 --> 00:04:18,379
I see you have your book
for protection there.

50
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:22,966
Didn't work with me, though, did it?

51
00:04:52,705 --> 00:04:55,166
Edward, how you doing, boy?

52
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:58,502
- Hello, Sarah.
- Hello, Macon.

53
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:03,883
- You made good time from the airport.
- We landed early...

54
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:05,802
...even with the storm.

55
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,598
- I made you some tea.
- Well, that's very nice of you, Sarah.

56
00:05:14,686 --> 00:05:16,271
So how was Atlanta?

57
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:18,065
About the same.

58
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:23,445
Peachtree Road, Peachtree Centre,
Peachtree Fire Hydrant.

59
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:26,031
Come on. Come on, Edward.

60
00:05:26,198 --> 00:05:27,949
Hello, Edward.

61
00:05:28,117 --> 00:05:29,534
He's a boy.

62
00:05:29,702 --> 00:05:31,954
How's your ears?

63
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:34,122
Okay.

64
00:05:34,873 --> 00:05:39,629
I think he still expects Ethan
to come home, even after a year.

65
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:44,883
Macon?

66
00:05:46,677 --> 00:05:48,512
Macon.

67
00:05:49,638 --> 00:05:51,890
You know I love you.

68
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:55,228
But I can't live with you anymore.

69
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:00,399
What?

70
00:06:01,066 --> 00:06:03,235
What did you say?

71
00:06:04,737 --> 00:06:07,239
I want a divorce, Macon.

72
00:06:08,115 --> 00:06:10,910
I rented an apartment downtown.

73
00:06:14,747 --> 00:06:16,749
Honey, listen, it's been a hard year.

74
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,751
We've had a hard time.

75
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:21,421
People who lose a child
often feel this way.

76
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:24,007
It puts a terrible strain
on a marriage...

77
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:27,093
...but it doesn't have to tear us apart.

78
00:06:28,762 --> 00:06:30,388
Listen, I've been thinking...

79
00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:32,849
...have you considered
having another baby?

80
00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:35,769
- Oh, Macon.
- I know we can't replace Ethan, but-

81
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:38,688
No, I'm sorry. It would never work.

82
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:43,360
All right, forget that.

83
00:06:43,527 --> 00:06:47,031
It was a crazy idea, right?
Crazy notion, but...

84
00:06:48,532 --> 00:06:51,534
All I'm saying is, we can start over.

85
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:59,543
Macon, ever since Ethan died, I've had
to admit that people are basically bad.

86
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,628
Evil, Macon.

87
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,381
They're so evil they'd take
our 12-year-old boy...

88
00:07:04,548 --> 00:07:07,384
...and shoot him through the skull
for no reason.

89
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:11,055
There have been times
I haven't been sure I-

90
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,475
Haven't been sure I could live
in this kind of world anymore.

91
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,648
It's true what you say
about human beings.

92
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:22,900
I'm not trying to argue.

93
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,820
Tell me, Sarah, why would
that cause you to leave me?

94
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,656
Because I knew you wouldn't
try and argue.

95
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,659
You believed all along they were evil.

96
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:36,163
This whole past year I've felt myself
withdrawing from people...

97
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,416
...just like you do, Macon.

98
00:07:38,582 --> 00:07:40,543
I've felt myself becoming a Leary.

99
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,505
Well, there are worse disasters
than that, I guess.

100
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,215
Not for me.

101
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,509
Macon, I know you loved Ethan.

102
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:53,347
And I know you mourn him,
but there's something so...

103
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:54,974
What do you call it?

104
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,519
Muffled about the way
you experience things.

105
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,564
It's like you're trying to slip
through life unchanged.

106
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,777
Sarah, I'm not muffled.
I endure. I'm holding steady.

107
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:11,074
I know you think that,
but I think you're fooling yourself.

108
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:16,455
It's not by chance you write books telling
people how to make trips without a jolt...

109
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:21,251
...so they can travel to wonderful, exotic
places and never be touched by them.

110
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,879
Never feel they've left home.

111
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,924
That traveling armchair isn't
just your logo. It's you.

112
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:30,385
No, it's not. It's not.

113
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:37,476
When Ethan was in this house with us,
we were all right.

114
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:42,230
If there was a distance between us, it
didn't matter. We had Ethan in common.

115
00:08:42,398 --> 00:08:46,735
But when we lost him, I needed you.

116
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:49,655
I needed you to comfort me.

117
00:08:49,822 --> 00:08:53,326
I needed you to be the kind of person
you've never been...

118
00:08:53,492 --> 00:08:56,412
...and that isn't even fair to ask of you.

119
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,873
That's why I have to go.

120
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:04,212
- Sarah-
- Don't fight this, Macon.

121
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:07,340
I don't know
how much strength I've got.

122
00:09:07,507 --> 00:09:11,427
I'm never gonna recover from
Ethan's death. I don't expect it.

123
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:15,599
But there's a chance that I could
make a life anyway.

124
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:20,019
But my only hope
is to get out of here...

125
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:22,272
...away from you.

126
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:25,942
Let me go.

127
00:10:09,361 --> 00:10:12,365
<i>In the Southeast they say
that if you want to go to heaven...</i>

128
00:10:12,573 --> 00:10:16,327
<i>...you have to change planes
in Atlanta.</i>

129
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:23,084
<i>The airport in Atlanta must have
10 miles of corridors.</i>

130
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,347
Come or go, Edward.
Oh, make up your mind.

131
00:10:46,065 --> 00:10:50,528
I could stop by and pick up the rug
on Saturday, if that's convenient.

132
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,034
Well, I leave for England
tomorrow afternoon.

133
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:58,870
Maybe I could bring the rug over.

134
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:01,957
<i>Or I could let myself in on Saturday.</i>

135
00:11:04,376 --> 00:11:08,296
I should have agreed to teach
summer school or something.

136
00:11:09,465 --> 00:11:14,636
Open my eyes in the morning and I think,
Why bother getting up?

137
00:11:16,597 --> 00:11:20,684
<i>Why bother eating?
Why bother breathing?</i>

138
00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:24,981
Me too, sweetheart.

139
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,318
Mr. Leary, come with me, please,
to identify the body.

140
00:12:22,456 --> 00:12:24,750
Yes, that is my son.

141
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:37,470
<i>So I guess I'll come by
while you're gone, if that's all right.</i>

142
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:22,183
Oh, sorry.

143
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:30,358
Come on, Edward.
There's nothing to worry about.

144
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:37,282
- Hi there.
- Do you board dogs?

145
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,577
- Sure.
- I'd like to board Edward here.

146
00:13:40,744 --> 00:13:43,163
- Do you have a reservation?
- A reservation? No.

147
00:13:43,371 --> 00:13:46,041
- Most people reserve.
- Could you make an exception?

148
00:13:46,207 --> 00:13:48,877
I've just come from the place
we've used before.

149
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:53,131
Suddenly they tell me they can't take
him, that he bit someone last time.

150
00:13:53,298 --> 00:13:57,218
Edward, do you bite?
How could you do such a thing?

151
00:13:57,386 --> 00:13:59,722
I'm catching a plane.
I'm leaving for a week...

152
00:13:59,888 --> 00:14:04,225
...and I don't have a soul to look
after him. I'm desperate, I tell you.

153
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,812
- Can't you leave home with your wife?
- No.

154
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:10,065
- You're not married?
- I am, but she's living elsewhere.

155
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:12,902
They don't allow pets.

156
00:14:14,903 --> 00:14:16,655
I'm a divorcee myself.

157
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:19,075
I know what you're going through.

158
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:20,660
So will you keep him?

159
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:24,329
I guess, if you're desperate.

160
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:27,833
Fill this out. Your name and address
and when you'll be back.

161
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,419
Don't forget to put when you'll be back.

162
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:36,008
I'll most likely see you again
when you pick him up...

163
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,511
...if you put the time of day
to expect you.

164
00:14:38,844 --> 00:14:40,221
My name is MurieI.

165
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:42,014
Is this place open evenings?

166
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:45,851
- Every evening but Sundays, till 8.
- Oh, good.

167
00:14:47,771 --> 00:14:49,647
MurieI Pritchett.

168
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:01,868
<i>In London, England, I recommend
the Underground...</i>

169
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:06,122
<i>...for everyone except those
afraid of heights...</i>

170
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:11,962
<i>...and even for them, if they will avoid
the following stations.</i>

171
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:19,678
<i>It's mystifying why all hotels
throughout the world choose only...</i>

172
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:24,641
<i>...the most abrasive fabrics
for their bedspreads.</i>

173
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:31,106
<i>London is among
the better foreign destinations...</i>

174
00:15:31,315 --> 00:15:35,903
<i>...in the important category
of hotel plumbing.</i>

175
00:15:51,377 --> 00:15:54,755
<i>The British have only mixed success
with American cuisine...</i>

176
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,844
<i>...but the traveler with persistence
can find a meal in London...</i>

177
00:16:00,011 --> 00:16:02,430
<i>...not much different from a meal
in Cleveland.</i>

178
00:16:10,354 --> 00:16:11,522
Here you are, guvnor.

179
00:16:13,107 --> 00:16:15,526
Just as sold at the Yankee Stadium.

180
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,904
Have a nice day.

181
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:45,640
- Can I help you?
- I'm here for my dog.

182
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:47,893
- Your last name?
- Leary.

183
00:16:48,477 --> 00:16:51,730
Oh, just a minute.

184
00:17:03,325 --> 00:17:06,245
Hi there. How was your trip?

185
00:17:08,413 --> 00:17:10,582
Oh, it was...

186
00:17:10,749 --> 00:17:12,460
Where's Edward? Is he all right?

187
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:15,337
Sure, he's all right.
We got on like a house afire.

188
00:17:15,505 --> 00:17:18,340
Seems he took a shine to me.
I couldn't say why.

189
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:22,344
That's wonderful. So...

190
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,350
- ...could I have him back, please?
- Caroline will bring him.

191
00:17:29,101 --> 00:17:32,313
- Maybe I could pay.
- Yes.

192
00:17:34,023 --> 00:17:37,777
That will be $42.

193
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,616
Thank you.

194
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:57,672
Signature and phone.

195
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,554
I don't know if I mentioned before
that it so happens I train dogs.

196
00:18:04,137 --> 00:18:05,931
Is that right?

197
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:08,976
- That home phone or your business?
- Both.

198
00:18:09,142 --> 00:18:10,936
Why? What difference does it make?

199
00:18:11,561 --> 00:18:15,232
I was just wondering.
My specialty is dogs that bite.

200
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:19,987
Specialty. Webster prefers specialty.

201
00:18:20,153 --> 00:18:23,741
- That must be dangerous.
- Not for me. I can handle anything...

202
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,371
...dogs that haven't been treated right,
even split personality.

203
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,333
- Split personality?
- Your dog is nice to you but kills others.

204
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:35,419
- Come on.
- Not that he would bite me.

205
00:18:35,586 --> 00:18:37,797
- He just fell in love with me.
- I'm glad to hear it.

206
00:18:39,966 --> 00:18:41,300
I could train him
not to bite other people.

207
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:43,761
Think about it and give me a call.
MurieI, remember?

208
00:18:43,928 --> 00:18:47,640
MurieI Pritchett.
Let me give you my card.

209
00:18:49,433 --> 00:18:52,270
Oh, well, I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you very much.

210
00:18:52,437 --> 00:18:55,022
Or just call for no reason. Call and talk.

211
00:18:55,189 --> 00:18:57,108
- Talk?
- Sure.

212
00:18:57,275 --> 00:19:00,904
Talk about Edward, his problems.
Talk about anything.

213
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:07,786
- Don't you ever get the urge to do that?
- Not really.

214
00:20:05,845 --> 00:20:08,764
- Yeah?
- Dad?

215
00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:11,517
<i>Dad?</i>

216
00:20:11,934 --> 00:20:13,853
Ethan?

217
00:20:15,313 --> 00:20:17,106
Where are you?

218
00:20:17,272 --> 00:20:19,442
<i>I'm at camp, Dad.</i>

219
00:20:19,608 --> 00:20:21,777
<i>You never came to get me.</i>

220
00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:24,406
But we thought you were dead.

221
00:20:24,614 --> 00:20:26,908
<i>Why would you think that?</i>

222
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:59,148
<i>We have, coming up,
brand-new pieces of gold...</i>

223
00:20:59,316 --> 00:21:02,068
<i>...brand-new Capodimonte
and two gorgeous rings.</i>

224
00:21:02,235 --> 00:21:05,321
<i>Bob, guess what ring I have.
My mom's and my favourite...</i>

225
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:08,617
<i>...this is the beautiful
one-carat diamond swirl cluster ring.</i>

226
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:11,620
<i>Take a look at this ring.
It is gorgeous. I have the-</i>

227
00:21:12,496 --> 00:21:15,666
- Leary.
- Macon, it's Muriel.

228
00:21:17,334 --> 00:21:19,753
- MurieI?
- Muriel Pritchett.

229
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,089
Oh, yes.

230
00:21:22,255 --> 00:21:25,009
From the vet's, who got on so good
with your dog.

231
00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:29,054
- Oh, right.
- I was just wondering how Edward was.

232
00:21:31,348 --> 00:21:34,268
- Looks all right to me.
- No problems?

233
00:21:34,435 --> 00:21:38,648
Well, he's developed this new symptom.
He gets angry when I leave the house.

234
00:21:38,856 --> 00:21:41,776
He starts barking and showing his teeth.

235
00:21:41,943 --> 00:21:43,736
<i>He ought to be trained.</i>

236
00:21:44,112 --> 00:21:47,698
Tell you what, maybe I could just
come around and discuss it.

237
00:21:48,616 --> 00:21:51,119
- I don't think-
- Or you could come to my place.

238
00:21:51,286 --> 00:21:53,287
<i>I'd fix you supper.</i>

239
00:21:53,954 --> 00:21:56,290
<i>Macon, what do you say?</i>

240
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:01,045
I think for now I'll just try
to manage on my own.

241
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:03,381
Well, I can understand that.

242
00:22:03,548 --> 00:22:06,259
Believe me, I've been through that stage.

243
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:09,470
So, what I'll do is, I'll wait for you
to get in touch.

244
00:22:10,472 --> 00:22:12,808
Yes, that would be good.

245
00:22:12,974 --> 00:22:16,645
- Goodbye.
- I don't wanna be pushy-

246
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:26,404
<i>This is a porcelain rocking horse
and a music box.</i>

247
00:22:26,571 --> 00:22:30,618
<i>This is handcrafted porcelain.
Hand-painted and gorgeous.</i>

248
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:33,662
<i>Nine inches high. $59, a very low-</i>

249
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:46,758
If you wanna come down, come.
Otherwise, go away...

250
00:22:46,926 --> 00:22:50,971
...but stop that pitiful whimpering.
This basement is not haunted.

251
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:59,981
That ought to do nicely.

252
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:27,383
Buck up.

253
00:23:33,723 --> 00:23:36,393
That's the stuff, Edward.

254
00:23:37,144 --> 00:23:41,314
Don't give up, Edward. We can make it.
Come on.

255
00:24:23,941 --> 00:24:27,528
<i>There is something elementally
comforting to the business traveler...</i>

256
00:24:27,695 --> 00:24:30,990
<i>...about that moment when his flight
touches down once again...</i>

257
00:24:31,156 --> 00:24:32,867
<i>...at his own airport.</i>

258
00:24:33,034 --> 00:24:36,705
<i>After a demanding journey,
even the most impersonal terminal...</i>

259
00:24:36,871 --> 00:24:41,000
<i>...can seem as welcoming
as an ancestral home.</i>

260
00:24:47,173 --> 00:24:50,301
I don't think anyone else
has any idea where I am.

261
00:24:50,468 --> 00:24:53,638
- What do you mean?
- I've come over here to stay for a while.

262
00:24:53,805 --> 00:24:56,099
- Does it matter?
- Should you tell Sarah?

263
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:58,560
It's nice to be so...

264
00:24:59,978 --> 00:25:02,897
...unconnected.
I wish things could stay that way.

265
00:25:03,065 --> 00:25:04,733
Why can't they?

266
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:09,404
Well, you know, someone will call here,
Sarah or someone.

267
00:25:09,613 --> 00:25:12,824
- We could just not answer the phone.
- What? Let it ring?

268
00:25:12,991 --> 00:25:14,826
Why not?

269
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:16,411
Not answer it ever?

270
00:25:16,578 --> 00:25:20,082
Most who call me are neighbours.
They'll pop over if no one answers.

271
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:21,709
I won't miss it.

272
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,003
Let it ring.

273
00:25:33,094 --> 00:25:34,764
You stinker!

274
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,765
Hypodermic.

275
00:25:48,194 --> 00:25:49,695
You're a real stinker, Rose.

276
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:52,031
Disinfectant.

277
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:56,035
- You got it.
- I know.

278
00:25:56,202 --> 00:25:57,786
Doctors and nurses.

279
00:25:57,954 --> 00:25:59,622
Nurse.

280
00:26:02,458 --> 00:26:04,043
There you go.

281
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:06,796
Down! Down, dog!

282
00:26:06,963 --> 00:26:09,215
Macon!

283
00:26:09,382 --> 00:26:10,800
Help!

284
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:13,136
Call him off, damn it!

285
00:26:13,302 --> 00:26:14,554
Edward!

286
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,347
Call off your dog!

287
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,892
Edward, stop that. Who is that?

288
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:20,852
This is your employer, Macon.

289
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,063
Julian?

290
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:25,148
Come here, Edward.
Come on. Come on.

291
00:26:25,315 --> 00:26:27,150
Come here.

292
00:26:27,316 --> 00:26:29,736
Come on. Come on.

293
00:26:34,908 --> 00:26:37,911
I really hate a man
with an obnoxious dog.

294
00:26:38,077 --> 00:26:40,330
I don't hate just the dog,
I hate the owner.

295
00:26:40,496 --> 00:26:44,751
I'm sorry about this. I thought he was
off on a walk with my brother, Porter.

296
00:26:44,918 --> 00:26:47,087
- What happened to your leg?
- I broke it.

297
00:26:47,254 --> 00:26:49,005
I can see that. But how?

298
00:26:49,173 --> 00:26:53,302
Well, it's kind of hard to explain.
How did you find me here?

299
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:57,264
From the return address
on the chapters you sent me.

300
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,683
Very interesting.

301
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:04,021
Do you realize how late you're running
with this guidebook?

302
00:27:04,647 --> 00:27:07,274
Edward, cut it out!

303
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:25,627
This is quite a place.

304
00:27:25,793 --> 00:27:28,880
It was my grandparents' house.
I grew up here.

305
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:30,631
Where's Sarah?

306
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:33,008
- Who?
- Your wife, Macon.

307
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:36,887
Oh, she and I are...

308
00:27:39,849 --> 00:27:42,852
She has this...

309
00:27:44,354 --> 00:27:46,523
...apartment downtown.

310
00:27:46,689 --> 00:27:48,692
You've split?

311
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:50,402
Yeah.

312
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,196
Jesus, Macon.

313
00:27:53,363 --> 00:27:56,365
- What went wrong?
- Nothing.

314
00:27:57,451 --> 00:28:01,704
It turns out these things can happen
for no particular reason.

315
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:04,791
Hush, now.

316
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:11,215
Hello.

317
00:28:11,548 --> 00:28:13,383
Hello.

318
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:17,554
Julian Hedge, this is my sister, Rose,
and my other brother, Charles.

319
00:28:17,721 --> 00:28:19,306
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

320
00:28:19,472 --> 00:28:22,226
Here, let me help you with that.

321
00:28:23,977 --> 00:28:27,356
- Charles, how do you do?
- Hello.

322
00:28:27,523 --> 00:28:31,402
Macon Leary with a sister
and brothers too.

323
00:28:31,569 --> 00:28:34,363
Who would've guessed?
That Macon Leary had a family...

324
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,699
...just never entered my mind somehow.

325
00:28:36,991 --> 00:28:39,077
I'm right here, Julian.

326
00:28:39,576 --> 00:28:43,080
Yes, I do see a family resemblance.

327
00:28:43,247 --> 00:28:47,668
You're Macon's publisher. I'm the one
who mailed you Macon's chapters.

328
00:28:47,835 --> 00:28:50,504
- Oh, yes.
- I'm supposed to send you some more...

329
00:28:50,672 --> 00:28:55,260
...but first I have to buy 9 by 12
envelopes. All we've got left is 10 by 13.

330
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:57,303
It's terrible when things
don't fit precisely.

331
00:28:57,469 --> 00:29:00,181
They get all out of alignment.

332
00:29:03,601 --> 00:29:05,520
We wouldn't wanna keep you, Rose.

333
00:29:06,187 --> 00:29:10,150
Oh, no. Here, I'll take that.

334
00:29:16,864 --> 00:29:21,369
The Macon Leary 9 by 12 envelope crisis.

335
00:29:21,537 --> 00:29:23,538
Oh, Julian, drop it.

336
00:29:23,705 --> 00:29:25,373
Sorry.

337
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:30,045
You know, Macon, if you'd just let me
know what was going on in your life.

338
00:29:30,212 --> 00:29:31,797
I had no idea.

339
00:29:31,963 --> 00:29:35,467
Look, if you want another-
I don't know, another month?

340
00:29:35,634 --> 00:29:38,303
Oh, nonsense.
What's a missing wife or two, right?

341
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,556
Here, let me get what I've typed
and you can check it.

342
00:29:55,154 --> 00:29:57,156
Just what I thought.

343
00:29:57,323 --> 00:30:00,493
You monster, do you know how long
I've been looking for you?

344
00:30:07,416 --> 00:30:09,418
Great.

345
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:36,738
<i>Call it something catchy.
The Reluctant Tourist.</i>

346
00:30:36,905 --> 00:30:39,199
<i>And you are the fella
to write it.</i>

347
00:30:39,365 --> 00:30:41,285
<i>But I hate to travel.</i>

348
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:44,203
I thought so.
So do businessmen.

349
00:30:44,371 --> 00:30:47,082
They would rather be at home
in their living rooms.

350
00:30:47,248 --> 00:30:50,501
So you will be helping them
to pretend...

351
00:30:50,669 --> 00:30:52,880
...that that's where they are.

352
00:30:53,797 --> 00:30:55,549
What do you think?

353
00:30:56,925 --> 00:30:59,678
Your logo. You get it?

354
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,807
While armchair travelers
dream of going places...

355
00:31:04,016 --> 00:31:07,394
...traveling armchairs
dream of staying put.

356
00:31:15,235 --> 00:31:19,615
After this, I want you to start
on New York and the Northeast again.

357
00:31:20,532 --> 00:31:22,368
So soon?

358
00:31:22,535 --> 00:31:24,286
It's been three years, Macon.

359
00:31:28,332 --> 00:31:30,918
Edward! Stop it!

360
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:39,259
Macon, did he get you?

361
00:31:42,263 --> 00:31:45,432
- I wouldn't have a dog like that.
- He's never done that.

362
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,436
I'd call the SPCA or the dogcatcher.

363
00:31:48,603 --> 00:31:51,397
Tell them you want him done away with.

364
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:54,567
Just go, Julian.

365
00:31:55,193 --> 00:31:56,861
Hold on, hold on.

366
00:31:57,069 --> 00:31:59,906
We have a couple more limas.
Yeah, we do.

367
00:32:00,114 --> 00:32:02,075
What do we have next?

368
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:08,581
Now I need M's or N's,
anything starting with those.

369
00:32:08,749 --> 00:32:11,751
Then how about these noodles?
N for noodles.

370
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,044
P for pasta?

371
00:32:13,252 --> 00:32:17,173
E for elbow macaroni. You might
have passed those up earlier, Porter.

372
00:32:17,382 --> 00:32:19,092
Rose?

373
00:32:19,885 --> 00:32:21,636
Rose?

374
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:25,891
It seems Edward's given me
a little sort of nip.

375
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:27,892
- Oh, Macon.
- How did it happen?

376
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:31,230
It was an accident,
but I think I need an antiseptic.

377
00:32:31,397 --> 00:32:34,483
- You need a tetanus shot.
- You need to get rid of that dog.

378
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:35,985
He didn't mean any harm.

379
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:38,737
Takes your hand off
and he means no harm?

380
00:32:38,905 --> 00:32:41,240
You should get rid of him, I tell you.

381
00:32:41,448 --> 00:32:43,909
- Well, I can't.
- Why not?

382
00:32:45,953 --> 00:32:48,289
Come on, boy. Yeah!

383
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:58,424
Ethan, you think
you could do that outside?

384
00:32:59,425 --> 00:33:01,260
Right.

385
00:33:04,263 --> 00:33:06,975
I just can't get rid of him,
that's all.

386
00:33:13,314 --> 00:33:15,650
Macon, come sit down.

387
00:33:15,816 --> 00:33:18,277
Let me see what I have.

388
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,868
Maybe we could send him
to obedience school.

389
00:33:27,954 --> 00:33:29,956
Edward, sit.

390
00:33:35,294 --> 00:33:37,839
Now, you kind of cluck
your tongue.

391
00:33:42,844 --> 00:33:46,765
They get to know a cluck means praise.
When I hold my hand out, see...

392
00:33:46,973 --> 00:33:48,558
...that means he has to stay.

393
00:33:48,725 --> 00:33:50,310
Stay.

394
00:33:57,567 --> 00:33:59,736
That was very good.

395
00:34:03,324 --> 00:34:05,951
He's supposed to wear this
till he's trained.

396
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,914
That way, you can yank him back
whenever he does something wrong.

397
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,921
Here you go.

398
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,968
Make him sit.

399
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,184
Sit.

400
00:34:31,186 --> 00:34:33,020
Poke him down.

401
00:34:51,373 --> 00:34:54,959
- He doesn't take you seriously.
- I know that.

402
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:59,630
Years ago, I saw this ad in the paper:
Make extra money in your off-hours.

403
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:02,342
A dog-training firm
that went to people's houses.

404
00:35:02,509 --> 00:35:06,263
Doggie Do, it was called.
Don't you just hate that name?

405
00:35:10,726 --> 00:35:11,893
Who's the lady?

406
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:14,187
Lady?

407
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:16,648
I saw a lady walking
through the kitchen.

408
00:35:16,816 --> 00:35:18,817
Oh, that's Rose.

409
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:21,987
- Is she your ex-wife, or what?
- She's my sister.

410
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,447
Your sister.

411
00:35:24,657 --> 00:35:27,451
This house belongs to her.

412
00:35:28,243 --> 00:35:30,537
I don't live with anybody either.

413
00:35:30,788 --> 00:35:33,082
You can release him now.

414
00:35:33,958 --> 00:35:35,084
Pardon?

415
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,294
Release your dog.

416
00:35:38,796 --> 00:35:40,797
What do you do for a living?

417
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:43,050
I write.

418
00:35:43,592 --> 00:35:46,178
- Travel guidebooks.
- Travel guides!

419
00:35:46,345 --> 00:35:48,806
Lucky. I love to travel.

420
00:35:48,973 --> 00:35:51,934
Oh, travel.
It's just red tape, mostly.

421
00:35:52,101 --> 00:35:54,645
Ticket lines, customs lines.

422
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:58,858
Should Edward be barking that way?

423
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:06,323
If I could go anywhere,
I'd go to Paris.

424
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:08,034
It sounds so romantic.

425
00:36:08,201 --> 00:36:10,245
Paris, actually, is terrible.

426
00:36:10,495 --> 00:36:12,664
Everybody's impolite.

427
00:36:12,831 --> 00:36:14,749
Take me with you next time.

428
00:36:14,916 --> 00:36:17,168
I could show you the good parts.

429
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:21,131
I have a very limited expense account.

430
00:36:21,298 --> 00:36:23,967
I never even took my wife.

431
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,220
My wife.

432
00:36:27,387 --> 00:36:30,056
I was only teasing.
You think I meant it?

433
00:36:31,015 --> 00:36:32,059
Oh, no.

434
00:36:32,768 --> 00:36:35,896
That'll be $ 14.40, including
the leash and the choke chain.

435
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:41,401
You have to practice what he's learned.
No one else can practice for you.

436
00:36:45,029 --> 00:36:47,533
You can pay me the other
4 cents tomorrow.

437
00:36:48,575 --> 00:36:50,368
Sit.

438
00:37:00,295 --> 00:37:03,174
Are you absolutely clear about this?

439
00:37:04,258 --> 00:37:07,344
Yes. I know exactly where we are.

440
00:37:07,553 --> 00:37:09,596
I have the address right here.

441
00:37:09,763 --> 00:37:13,100
- Now, I'll be back in one half hour.
- Are you sure?

442
00:37:13,267 --> 00:37:17,772
Macon, please. I'm just going
around the corner. Now, goodbye.

443
00:37:46,468 --> 00:37:49,804
<i>The Accidental Tourist on Crutches.</i>

444
00:37:53,558 --> 00:37:56,060
I guess I'll be going.
My sister's picking me up.

445
00:37:56,227 --> 00:37:58,563
Rose? She's coming here?

446
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,773
I'd like to see her.

447
00:38:00,983 --> 00:38:04,028
Macon, do me a favour.

448
00:38:04,194 --> 00:38:06,613
Couldn't you invite me
to a family dinner?

449
00:38:08,657 --> 00:38:11,786
Well, we're really not much
for socializing.

450
00:38:11,952 --> 00:38:16,123
Wouldn't have to be anything fancy,
just whatever you eat normally.

451
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:18,292
What do you eat, normally?

452
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:21,170
Or I'll bring the meal myself.

453
00:38:21,337 --> 00:38:25,091
You could lock up your dog
and I'll come spend the evening.

454
00:38:25,257 --> 00:38:26,467
We'll see.

455
00:38:27,134 --> 00:38:28,845
Whenever my dad said that,
it meant no.

456
00:38:35,142 --> 00:38:38,146
When I was in high school,
I made nothing but A's.

457
00:38:38,521 --> 00:38:40,648
You're surprised at that, aren't you?

458
00:38:41,815 --> 00:38:44,026
Now, this is the heel command.

459
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:50,116
You think I'm kind of,
like, not an intellect.

460
00:38:50,282 --> 00:38:53,286
- I know you're surprised.
- No, I'm not.

461
00:38:54,995 --> 00:38:58,208
Now, he's supposed
to match his pace to anything I do.

462
00:38:58,374 --> 00:39:01,168
Slow, fast, anything.

463
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:07,926
Sit!

464
00:39:09,094 --> 00:39:10,637
Heel!

465
00:39:15,683 --> 00:39:16,935
Good.

466
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:25,652
I think he's got the hang of it.
Now you.

467
00:39:33,618 --> 00:39:36,455
Yank that leash!
He knows what he's supposed to do.

468
00:39:37,748 --> 00:39:41,960
Good. Don't forget to cluck. Every
little minute you have to praise him.

469
00:39:43,462 --> 00:39:45,088
Pick up that slack!

470
00:39:45,338 --> 00:39:47,008
Cluck!

471
00:39:49,468 --> 00:39:51,804
This is a bit more difficult
with crutches.

472
00:39:51,971 --> 00:39:55,057
I once taught a man who had no legs
and only one arm.

473
00:39:55,224 --> 00:39:57,059
- And he had a Great Dane.
- Really?

474
00:39:57,226 --> 00:39:59,437
You're not in such bad shape.

475
00:40:00,646 --> 00:40:03,857
I have to get going.
That'll be $5, please.

476
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:06,402
Plus the 4 cents
you owe me from yesterday.

477
00:40:13,284 --> 00:40:17,497
Next time I'll stay longer and talk.
That's a promise.

478
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:25,546
<i>It is an unfortunate fact that even
the most conscientious traveler...</i>

479
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,216
<i>...cannot be prepared
for every encounter.</i>

480
00:40:28,383 --> 00:40:30,468
<i>At such times,
one must remain calm...</i>

481
00:40:30,635 --> 00:40:32,262
<i>...and rely upon one's
innate common sense.</i>

482
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:05,212
- Hello, Rose.
- Hello, Julian.

483
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,172
Come in.

484
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:14,054
I've brought some materials
for Macon.

485
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:19,393
- Do I hear that dog?
- Yes, he's in the back yard.

486
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,355
Hello, Julian.

487
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:24,314
Hi, guys.

488
00:41:25,899 --> 00:41:29,820
- Hope I'm not interfering with supper.
- No, no.

489
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:32,948
- We're finished.
- Really?

490
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,619
What time do you eat, anyhow?

491
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:39,830
We haven't had our coffee.
Wouldn't you like some coffee?

492
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:42,083
I'd love some.

493
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:48,089
Well, that seems a little silly,
if you haven't eaten.

494
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:52,176
For me, home-brewed coffee's
a real treat.

495
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,929
Everybody in my apartment
building eats out.

496
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:56,806
There's nothing in their kitchens...

497
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,642
...but a couple of cans of soda
and some peanuts.

498
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:03,020
- What kind of place is that?
- It's the Calvert Arms.

499
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:06,774
It's a singles' building.
Everybody's single.

500
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:08,777
What an interesting idea.

501
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,988
Well, not really.

502
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,450
Sometimes I wish for the
old-fashioned way of doing things...

503
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:18,245
...with children and old people,
like normal buildings.

504
00:42:18,704 --> 00:42:20,622
Well, of course you do.

505
00:42:20,789 --> 00:42:24,293
I'm going to get you
some nice, hot coffee.

506
00:42:30,757 --> 00:42:32,092
Here you go.

507
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,103
Where's Porter?

508
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:46,315
We're not sure. He went to a hardware
store. We think he got lost.

509
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:49,944
- Good grief! When did this happen?
- A little while before supper.

510
00:42:50,486 --> 00:42:51,988
Supper. You mean today?

511
00:42:52,154 --> 00:42:54,239
He's running an errand
on Howard Street.

512
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:57,284
He's not lost
in any permanent sense.

513
00:42:58,244 --> 00:42:59,787
He got lost on Howard Street?

514
00:42:59,996 --> 00:43:02,540
It's a problem with this family,
directions.

515
00:43:02,999 --> 00:43:04,875
- Really?
- Charles.

516
00:43:05,335 --> 00:43:06,794
What?

517
00:43:07,253 --> 00:43:08,421
Never mind.

518
00:43:08,588 --> 00:43:10,214
I'll go help Rose.

519
00:43:15,052 --> 00:43:17,722
Julian seems very nice.

520
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:20,809
He's here because he hopes
we'll do something eccentric.

521
00:43:20,975 --> 00:43:24,020
I pray none of us says anything
unconventional around him.

522
00:43:24,187 --> 00:43:25,480
What would we say?

523
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:28,775
We're the most
conventional people I know.

524
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:34,948
We bought every map
you can buy for Baltimore.

525
00:43:35,114 --> 00:43:38,743
Alphabetized them, and still...
It's sad, really.

526
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:49,338
Oh, and what do you want
in your coffee?

527
00:43:49,505 --> 00:43:51,506
Just black's fine.

528
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:55,969
Coffee, Macon?

529
00:43:56,303 --> 00:43:57,679
No, thank you.

530
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:00,141
Here you go.

531
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:08,482
What do you do
for a living, Charles?

532
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:10,401
I make bottle caps.

533
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:13,654
- Bottle caps? Is that a fact.
- Well...

534
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:17,241
...it's not half as exciting
as it sounds, really.

535
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:22,163
And, Rose, do you work?

536
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:26,333
Yes, I do.
I work at home.

537
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:28,044
I keep house for the boys.

538
00:44:28,211 --> 00:44:33,174
Also, I take care of the older neighbours.
They need me to repair their plumbing.

539
00:44:34,926 --> 00:44:36,803
You repair their plumbing.

540
00:44:44,227 --> 00:44:46,605
What do you think?
It could be, Porter.

541
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:48,564
But he knows we wouldn't answer.

542
00:44:48,731 --> 00:44:51,901
Yes, he'd surely call
a neighbour instead.

543
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:54,153
On the other hand...

544
00:44:55,322 --> 00:44:58,366
Do you always give this much thought
to your phone calls?

545
00:44:59,201 --> 00:45:02,079
Now, where exactly
is the Calvert Arms?

546
00:45:22,766 --> 00:45:24,477
Edward...

547
00:45:24,643 --> 00:45:26,353
...stay.

548
00:45:28,146 --> 00:45:30,232
Good dog.

549
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:36,155
To tell you the truth,
I didn't exactly plan on having a baby.

550
00:45:37,572 --> 00:45:40,993
In fact, the baby was the reason
we got married.

551
00:45:41,243 --> 00:45:44,288
Now, you watch him
while I walk away.

552
00:45:46,624 --> 00:45:49,668
Pretty soon he'll lie like that
for three hours straight.

553
00:45:49,877 --> 00:45:52,296
Three hours?
Isn't that sort of cruel?

554
00:45:53,005 --> 00:45:55,132
I thought you promised
not to talk like that.

555
00:45:55,299 --> 00:45:57,719
Right. Sorry.

556
00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:01,806
My son's name is Alexander.
Did I tell you that?

557
00:46:02,432 --> 00:46:06,143
Something went wrong, they had to do
a caesarean and take him out early.

558
00:46:06,353 --> 00:46:08,772
I can't ever have any more children.

559
00:46:09,271 --> 00:46:12,191
Alexander was so teeny,
he didn't even look like a human.

560
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,613
He had to stay in an incubator forever,
just about, and nearly died.

561
00:46:17,489 --> 00:46:19,408
Norman, that's my ex-husband...

562
00:46:19,574 --> 00:46:23,244
...he went, When's it gonna
look like other babies?

563
00:46:24,037 --> 00:46:26,831
Norman always called Alexander it.

564
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:30,585
Maybe you and Alexander
should get together sometime.

565
00:46:30,794 --> 00:46:34,298
- Oh, well, I-
- He doesn't have enough men in his life.

566
00:46:34,464 --> 00:46:37,842
Maybe the three of us could go
to a movie. You ever go to movies?

567
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,136
I...

568
00:46:39,302 --> 00:46:42,472
...really don't care for movies.

569
00:46:43,015 --> 00:46:46,602
They make everything seem so close-up.

570
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,571
Bedpan.

571
00:46:57,821 --> 00:47:00,407
- Outpatient.
- Anesthetic.

572
00:47:00,908 --> 00:47:02,827
Hypodermic.

573
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:21,762
One hundred forty degrees?

574
00:47:22,222 --> 00:47:24,641
Certain death.
What is she thinking?

575
00:47:24,807 --> 00:47:28,019
Two quarts of stuffing,
I heard her say so.

576
00:47:28,185 --> 00:47:31,981
Two quarts of teeming,
swarming bacteria.

577
00:47:35,985 --> 00:47:39,739
Is this the Thanksgiving we all die?

578
00:47:43,118 --> 00:47:45,203
Here comes the turkey.

579
00:47:49,123 --> 00:47:51,084
Here it is.

580
00:47:52,419 --> 00:47:55,714
Now, this is a real Thanksgiving.

581
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,925
I just wish my neighbours could see this.

582
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,222
There may be a little problem here.

583
00:48:03,889 --> 00:48:05,724
The rest of the meal is excellent.

584
00:48:05,891 --> 00:48:09,728
We could fill up on the vegetables alone.
In fact, I think I'll do that.

585
00:48:09,895 --> 00:48:11,354
What?

586
00:48:12,314 --> 00:48:15,150
- The turkey.
- What?

587
00:48:15,651 --> 00:48:17,777
Pure poison.

588
00:48:17,945 --> 00:48:18,987
Come again?

589
00:48:19,447 --> 00:48:24,285
We think it may have been cooked
at a slightly inadequate temperature.

590
00:48:24,743 --> 00:48:26,537
It was not.

591
00:48:26,704 --> 00:48:29,081
It's perfectly good.

592
00:48:29,707 --> 00:48:32,585
- Mrs. Barrett!
- I can hear you.

593
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:36,714
Maybe you'd rather just
stick to the side dishes.

594
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:40,426
Well, perhaps I will.

595
00:48:41,594 --> 00:48:44,763
I don't have much
of an appetite anyway.

596
00:48:45,639 --> 00:48:47,933
Macon, how could you do this?

597
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:50,770
My lovely turkey. All that work.

598
00:48:51,521 --> 00:48:53,230
I think it looks delicious.

599
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,775
Yes, but you don't know
about the other times.

600
00:48:55,942 --> 00:48:57,985
Other times?

601
00:48:59,445 --> 00:49:01,906
You don't fool me for an instant.

602
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:06,202
I know why you're doing this. You wanna
make me look bad in front of Julian.

603
00:49:06,703 --> 00:49:08,079
Julian?

604
00:49:08,246 --> 00:49:09,831
You wanna drive him off.

605
00:49:10,582 --> 00:49:13,752
You three wasted your chances
and now you want me to waste mine...

606
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:16,880
...but I won't do it!
I can see what's what.

607
00:49:18,131 --> 00:49:21,718
Love is what it's all about.
You wanna make me miss it.

608
00:49:21,968 --> 00:49:23,594
Well, goodness.

609
00:49:23,804 --> 00:49:27,558
You don't want me to stop cooking
for you and taking care of this house.

610
00:49:27,724 --> 00:49:30,143
You don't want Julian
to fall in love with me.

611
00:49:33,230 --> 00:49:34,607
Do what?

612
00:49:54,001 --> 00:49:56,837
Do you think I ought
to go after her?

613
00:49:57,504 --> 00:49:59,507
No.

614
00:50:01,342 --> 00:50:04,721
That poor, dear girl.
I feel just awful.

615
00:50:05,971 --> 00:50:08,265
- But she seems so-
- She's fine.

616
00:50:08,474 --> 00:50:10,726
She's perfectly fine.

617
00:50:12,103 --> 00:50:14,981
- Now, who wants a baked potato?
- I do.

618
00:50:15,147 --> 00:50:16,649
Me.

619
00:50:17,275 --> 00:50:19,361
Julian, potato?

620
00:50:20,695 --> 00:50:23,448
I'll take the turkey.

621
00:51:08,076 --> 00:51:12,706
Actually, have you ever noticed
that Julian wears crew necks?

622
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:18,003
That doesn't mean he wouldn't
wear a V-neck if he had one.

623
00:51:18,171 --> 00:51:21,590
He's younger, you know.
I don't know if you realize that.

624
00:51:21,799 --> 00:51:23,217
Two years.

625
00:51:23,718 --> 00:51:28,806
But he's got a younger style of living.
Singles apartments and so on.

626
00:51:29,015 --> 00:51:30,432
He's tired of all that.

627
00:51:31,976 --> 00:51:34,103
Don't try to spoil this, Macon.

628
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:35,980
I only want to protect you.

629
00:51:36,147 --> 00:51:39,442
It's wrong, you know,
what you said at Thanksgiving.

630
00:51:39,608 --> 00:51:42,403
Love is not what it's all about.

631
00:51:43,362 --> 00:51:46,116
There are all kinds of other issues.

632
00:51:47,742 --> 00:51:52,289
He ate my turkey and didn't get sick.

633
00:51:52,747 --> 00:51:56,834
Two big helpings.

634
00:52:07,721 --> 00:52:11,808
I got this car for only $200.
That's because it needed work.

635
00:52:11,975 --> 00:52:15,103
But I took it to Dominick,
this boy down the street.

636
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:18,566
I go, Dominick, here's the deal.
You fix my car...

637
00:52:18,732 --> 00:52:22,027
...I'll let you use it three nights
a week and all day Sunday.

638
00:52:22,194 --> 00:52:24,113
Wasn't that a good idea?

639
00:52:24,279 --> 00:52:26,490
Very inventive.

640
00:53:03,027 --> 00:53:04,069
Hi.

641
00:53:04,237 --> 00:53:06,030
What a good boy.

642
00:53:08,324 --> 00:53:10,452
Give him lots of praise.

643
00:53:11,411 --> 00:53:14,163
- We'll both go in the drugstore.
- Is it safe?

644
00:53:14,331 --> 00:53:16,916
Have to try it sooner or later.

645
00:53:25,592 --> 00:53:27,343
Too pink.

646
00:53:28,886 --> 00:53:31,640
What are you doing for dinner
tomorrow night?

647
00:53:32,182 --> 00:53:33,516
For dinner?

648
00:53:35,685 --> 00:53:37,854
Come and eat at my house.
Come on, it'll be fun.

649
00:53:38,438 --> 00:53:41,483
Just for dinner.
You and me and Alexander.

650
00:53:41,941 --> 00:53:44,027
Say 6:00.

651
00:53:44,194 --> 00:53:47,155
It's 51021 st Street.
Know where that is?

652
00:53:47,322 --> 00:53:49,783
Well, I don't believe I'm free then.

653
00:53:50,659 --> 00:53:51,993
Think it over.

654
00:53:58,501 --> 00:54:00,753
How old did you say
Alexander was?

655
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,505
He's 7.

656
00:54:03,297 --> 00:54:05,132
Have you thought?

657
00:54:06,383 --> 00:54:08,761
Have you given any thought
to coming to dinner?

658
00:54:08,969 --> 00:54:10,637
Oh, I...

659
00:54:12,723 --> 00:54:14,809
...could come.

660
00:54:15,976 --> 00:54:17,770
If it's only for dinner.

661
00:54:19,355 --> 00:54:21,440
What else would it be for?

662
00:54:21,774 --> 00:54:23,318
Here he is.

663
00:54:26,779 --> 00:54:27,822
Hi, sweetie.

664
00:54:32,952 --> 00:54:36,581
Alexander, this is Macon.
Can you say hi?

665
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:39,709
You're young to be at the doctor's
without your mother.

666
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:42,962
He's used to it. He's had to go often.
He's got allergies.

667
00:54:43,129 --> 00:54:44,172
I see.

668
00:54:45,006 --> 00:54:49,719
He's allergic to shellfish, milk, eggs
and most vegetables.

669
00:54:50,345 --> 00:54:52,305
We think he may be allergic to air.

670
00:54:52,472 --> 00:54:57,101
Whenever he's outside a long time,
any uncovered skin gets these bumps.

671
00:54:57,644 --> 00:55:00,480
If a bee stings him
and he hasn't had his shots...

672
00:55:00,647 --> 00:55:03,108
...he could be dead in half an hour.

673
00:55:10,156 --> 00:55:13,952
<i>Dear Muriel...</i>

674
00:55:15,996 --> 00:55:19,750
<i>...I am very sorry...</i>

675
00:55:20,501 --> 00:55:23,921
<i>...but I won't be able to have dinner
with you tomorrow after all.</i>

676
00:55:27,883 --> 00:55:30,678
<i>Something has come up.</i>

677
00:55:31,762 --> 00:55:33,764
<i>Regretfully...</i>

678
00:55:33,931 --> 00:55:35,807
<i>...Macon.</i>

679
00:56:32,574 --> 00:56:36,870
I've got a double-barreled shotgun
and I'm aiming it where your head is.

680
00:56:37,036 --> 00:56:38,706
It's Macon.

681
00:56:38,997 --> 00:56:40,332
Macon.

682
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:49,758
What are you doing here?

683
00:57:05,775 --> 00:57:07,318
Last year...

684
00:57:07,485 --> 00:57:09,445
...I- I lost-

685
00:57:09,612 --> 00:57:11,905
I experienced a loss.

686
00:57:12,073 --> 00:57:13,658
I lost-

687
00:57:14,116 --> 00:57:15,952
I lost my son.

688
00:57:17,537 --> 00:57:22,083
He was just-
He went into a hamburger joint...

689
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:25,628
...and then someone came...

690
00:57:25,962 --> 00:57:28,047
...a holdup man...

691
00:57:29,132 --> 00:57:31,259
...and shot him.

692
00:57:34,512 --> 00:57:37,682
I can't go to dinner with people.

693
00:57:38,558 --> 00:57:42,312
I can't talk to their little boys.
You have to stop asking me.

694
00:57:42,479 --> 00:57:47,483
I don't want to hurt your feelings,
but I'm just not up to this.

695
00:57:49,361 --> 00:57:51,362
Do you hear?

696
00:58:22,728 --> 00:58:26,649
Every day I tell myself
it's time to be getting over this.

697
00:58:26,815 --> 00:58:29,777
I know that people expect it of me.

698
00:58:31,278 --> 00:58:33,447
But if anything, I'm getting worse.

699
00:58:33,656 --> 00:58:37,743
The first year was like a bad dream.
I was clear to his door in the morning...

700
00:58:37,911 --> 00:58:41,205
...before I remembered
he wasn't there to be wakened.

701
00:58:45,627 --> 00:58:48,838
But the second year is real.

702
00:58:50,673 --> 00:58:55,511
I've stopped going to his door,
I've sometimes let a whole day pass by...

703
00:58:57,763 --> 00:59:01,351
...without thinking about him.

704
00:59:06,606 --> 00:59:11,027
I believe Sarah thinks I could have
prevented what happened somehow.

705
00:59:11,194 --> 00:59:15,157
She's so used to my arranging her life.

706
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:21,913
Now I'm far from everyone.

707
00:59:25,084 --> 00:59:27,919
I don't have any friends anymore.

708
00:59:30,172 --> 00:59:34,551
And everyone looks trivial
and foolish and...

709
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:40,099
...not related to me.

710
01:00:51,255 --> 01:00:52,881
Just sleep.

711
01:00:53,299 --> 01:00:55,508
Lie down and sleep.

712
01:01:38,386 --> 01:01:40,555
What is it, Mom?

713
01:01:41,222 --> 01:01:44,476
Go back to sleep, baby.
Everything's all right.

714
01:02:21,847 --> 01:02:24,683
I just want to sleep.

715
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,085
Can you take this off?

716
01:02:52,336 --> 01:02:54,338
I'm bashful.

717
01:03:43,013 --> 01:03:45,265
- Hey there, Macon.
- Hey there, girls.

718
01:03:45,432 --> 01:03:47,601
- Going to see MurieI?
- I thought I might.

719
01:03:47,768 --> 01:03:49,436
- You brought your own dinner.
- Yeah.

720
01:03:49,603 --> 01:03:51,938
- Good idea.
- You bet.

721
01:03:54,274 --> 01:03:56,902
All right, Gunther!

722
01:03:58,862 --> 01:04:02,866
Pizza man. Extra-large
combination, no anchovies.

723
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,994
I'm allergic to pizza.

724
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:08,288
What part?

725
01:04:08,456 --> 01:04:10,082
What part are you allergic to?

726
01:04:12,251 --> 01:04:14,837
Pepperoni? Sausage? Mushrooms?
We can take it off.

727
01:04:15,004 --> 01:04:16,881
All of it.

728
01:04:17,048 --> 01:04:20,384
- Can't be allergic to all of it.
- Well, I am.

729
01:04:23,179 --> 01:04:27,558
You didn't ask what happened with
his eye doctor. I was so worried about it.

730
01:04:27,726 --> 01:04:30,769
Sometimes you'd think
Alexander wasn't your grandson.

731
01:04:34,398 --> 01:04:37,068
Ma, I'm going now. Macon's here.

732
01:06:00,403 --> 01:06:02,197
See?

733
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:05,533
I shut the valve off.

734
01:06:05,742 --> 01:06:06,993
What did I do that for?

735
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:09,829
I'm not so sure about this.
He's not very strong.

736
01:06:10,496 --> 01:06:13,000
Why did I shut off the valve, Alexander?

737
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:15,835
- Why?
- You tell me.

738
01:06:16,002 --> 01:06:19,672
- You tell me.
- No, you.

739
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:23,760
- So the water won't whoosh all over?
- Right.

740
01:06:24,094 --> 01:06:27,931
Now, first you
unscrew the top screw.

741
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,644
- Let's see you do it.
- Me?

742
01:06:32,811 --> 01:06:35,105
- I don't want to.
- Just let him watch.

743
01:06:35,271 --> 01:06:38,316
Then he won't know how
to fix the one in the bathtub...

744
01:06:38,483 --> 01:06:42,070
...and I'm going to ask him
to manage that without me.

745
01:06:45,157 --> 01:06:48,493
That's it. Hard!

746
01:06:49,453 --> 01:06:51,038
Good.

747
01:06:51,205 --> 01:06:53,416
Good. Good.

748
01:06:55,292 --> 01:06:57,503
Look at that.

749
01:06:57,669 --> 01:07:01,673
Wonderful!
I think you may have natural talents.

750
01:07:01,883 --> 01:07:04,052
Now, take off the faucet head...

751
01:07:04,218 --> 01:07:07,221
...and there is the culprit.

752
01:07:07,388 --> 01:07:09,223
That has to be re-taped.

753
01:07:09,389 --> 01:07:11,851
Then we take this wrench
to tighten this up.

754
01:07:19,233 --> 01:07:22,528
- Now what?
- Go ahead and turn that valve.

755
01:07:24,071 --> 01:07:26,240
There we go.

756
01:07:26,407 --> 01:07:29,077
- Now what?
- Now we turn the water back on...

757
01:07:29,243 --> 01:07:32,580
...and see what
kind of job you've done.

758
01:07:33,707 --> 01:07:35,917
Look at that!

759
01:07:36,084 --> 01:07:39,170
You've solved the problem.

760
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:44,092
Now, when you're grown,
you can fix the faucets for your wife.

761
01:07:44,258 --> 01:07:46,678
Step back, dearie, you can say.

762
01:07:46,845 --> 01:07:49,097
Just let me see to this.

763
01:07:49,264 --> 01:07:52,559
Let a real man take care of this.

764
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:09,701
Good. Really excellent material.

765
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:12,746
I'd like to show you something, Macon.

766
01:08:15,957 --> 01:08:18,210
Your sister's Christmas present.

767
01:08:18,377 --> 01:08:21,464
- What is it?
- It's an engagement ring, Macon.

768
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,634
- Engagement?
- I wanna marry her.

769
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:28,053
- You want to marry Rose?
- I'm gonna ask her at Christmas...

770
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:31,015
...when I give her the ring.
I wanna do this properly.

771
01:08:31,182 --> 01:08:32,725
Old-fashioned.

772
01:08:32,891 --> 01:08:37,646
- You think she'll have me?
- Well, I really couldn't say.

773
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:43,403
Well, she's got to. I'm 36 years old,
Macon, but I tell you...

774
01:08:43,611 --> 01:08:46,239
...I feel like I'm a schoolboy
around that woman.

775
01:08:46,406 --> 01:08:49,950
You may laugh at this,
but I love the surprise of her.

776
01:08:50,118 --> 01:08:53,538
And I'm surprised by myself
when I'm with her.

777
01:08:54,205 --> 01:08:58,084
I'm not exactly the person
that I thought I was.

778
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:01,797
I'm afraid I'm gushing.

779
01:09:02,380 --> 01:09:05,800
Want to know something?
I've never even slept with her.

780
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:08,178
Well, I don't care to hear about that.

781
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:10,763
I want us to have a real wedding night.

782
01:09:10,930 --> 01:09:13,850
I want to do everything right. God...

783
01:09:14,017 --> 01:09:18,897
...Macon, isn't it amazing how two
separate lives can link up together?

784
01:09:19,106 --> 01:09:21,066
I mean, two differentnesses.

785
01:09:25,946 --> 01:09:29,700
- What I really like is T-shirts.
- T-shirts.

786
01:09:30,742 --> 01:09:33,912
The kind with a sort of
stretched-out neck.

787
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:36,040
I don't want it new.

788
01:09:36,206 --> 01:09:38,500
Tell you what.
Everything we buy...

789
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:41,878
...we'll wash about 20 times
before you wear it.

790
01:09:42,046 --> 01:09:44,172
- But nothing prewashed.
- No, no.

791
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:47,342
Only nerds wear prewashed.

792
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:49,220
Right.

793
01:09:51,555 --> 01:09:53,891
- Shall I come with you?
- I can do it myself.

794
01:09:54,058 --> 01:09:55,894
All right.

795
01:10:16,622 --> 01:10:19,667
- Macon!
- Yes.

796
01:10:21,210 --> 01:10:24,505
Laura Canfield.
Scott's mother, remember?

797
01:10:24,673 --> 01:10:26,507
Of course.

798
01:10:26,674 --> 01:10:29,761
Why, Scott.

799
01:10:30,178 --> 01:10:32,389
- Hi.
- It's nice to see you.

800
01:10:32,556 --> 01:10:34,641
- Yeah, me too.
- It's nice to see you.

801
01:10:34,808 --> 01:10:38,353
- Are you doing your spring shopping?
- Oh, I...

802
01:10:41,648 --> 01:10:43,733
I'm helping the son of a friend.

803
01:10:44,526 --> 01:10:49,072
We're buying the sock department. Every
other week Scott runs through his socks.

804
01:10:49,239 --> 01:10:51,909
You know how they are at this age.
Or rather-

805
01:10:53,493 --> 01:10:56,913
Yes, it's amazing, isn't it?

806
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:00,709
I look great!

807
01:11:18,978 --> 01:11:21,939
I think it's time we had a talk.

808
01:11:22,106 --> 01:11:24,317
About what?

809
01:11:24,483 --> 01:11:28,321
I'd like to know what you think
you're up to with this MurieI person.

810
01:11:28,487 --> 01:11:31,490
Is that what you call her,
this MurieI person?

811
01:11:33,159 --> 01:11:36,120
You're not yourself these days, Macon...

812
01:11:36,287 --> 01:11:39,540
...and this MurieI person
is just a symptom. Everybody says so.

813
01:11:39,749 --> 01:11:42,002
Who is everybody, anyway?

814
01:11:42,168 --> 01:11:46,339
We're just worried for you, Macon.

815
01:11:46,505 --> 01:11:49,467
Could we switch to some other topic?

816
01:11:51,177 --> 01:11:55,515
- I had to tell you what I thought.
- Fine. You've told me.

817
01:11:58,059 --> 01:12:02,189
Can you tell me
one unique thing about her?

818
01:12:02,355 --> 01:12:05,024
I mean, one really
special quality, Macon...

819
01:12:05,149 --> 01:12:08,111
...not something sloppy like
she appreciates me?

820
01:12:09,029 --> 01:12:11,865
I'm not such a bargain myself,
if you haven't noticed.

821
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:14,576
Somebody ought to
warn her away from me.

822
01:12:14,743 --> 01:12:16,954
That's not true. That's not true at all.

823
01:12:17,454 --> 01:12:20,791
I imagine her people
are congratulating her on her catch.

824
01:12:20,958 --> 01:12:24,587
- Her catch.
- Well, someone to support her. Anyone.

825
01:12:24,753 --> 01:12:26,713
She'd be lucky to find anyone.

826
01:12:27,339 --> 01:12:30,885
She lives in that slummy house,
her boy looks like he has hookworm-

827
01:12:31,051 --> 01:12:33,929
Porter, just shut the hell up.

828
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:49,236
Hey, you guys, let me catch up!

829
01:12:52,823 --> 01:12:54,408
Creep.

830
01:12:54,909 --> 01:12:57,037
Wait up for me!

831
01:12:57,286 --> 01:12:59,539
- Hey, guys!
- Get lost, Pritchett!

832
01:12:59,705 --> 01:13:02,959
- We don't need you around here.
- Come on, let me catch up!

833
01:13:03,709 --> 01:13:06,421
Go itch it, Pritchett!

834
01:13:07,338 --> 01:13:08,757
You heard me. Get lost!

835
01:13:08,923 --> 01:13:11,426
<i>- Itch it, Pritchett. Pritchett, itch it.
- Go.</i>

836
01:13:12,385 --> 01:13:14,179
Watch out!

837
01:13:14,345 --> 01:13:16,515
<i>Pritchett, itch it.</i>

838
01:13:20,393 --> 01:13:22,646
Hiya, boy. How you doing?

839
01:13:22,812 --> 01:13:24,940
Good boy!

840
01:13:26,107 --> 01:13:28,401
Good dog, Edward.

841
01:13:33,532 --> 01:13:34,907
Are you all right?

842
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:38,954
- What was that all about?
- Nothing.

843
01:13:53,468 --> 01:13:56,263
<i>Even the most disciplined
professional traveler...</i>

844
01:13:56,430 --> 01:13:59,767
<i>...may sometimes stumble across
that unexpected item he feels...</i>

845
01:13:59,934 --> 01:14:02,394
<i>...he simply must take home.</i>

846
01:14:02,561 --> 01:14:06,148
<i>That's fine, as long as one is willing
to accept the inconvenience...</i>

847
01:14:06,357 --> 01:14:10,820
<i>...and awkwardness that come
with each additional piece of baggage.</i>

848
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:21,414
I don't think Alexander's
getting a proper education.

849
01:14:21,581 --> 01:14:22,831
He's okay.

850
01:14:22,999 --> 01:14:27,128
I asked him to figure what change
they'd give back when we bought milk...

851
01:14:27,295 --> 01:14:30,882
...and he had no idea. He didn't
even know he'd have to subtract.

852
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:34,761
- He's only in second grade.
- You should switch to a private school.

853
01:14:34,969 --> 01:14:38,014
- Private schools cost money.
- So I'll pay.

854
01:14:38,181 --> 01:14:40,183
What are you saying?

855
01:14:41,017 --> 01:14:42,310
Pardon?

856
01:14:42,477 --> 01:14:44,729
Are you saying you're committed?

857
01:14:44,896 --> 01:14:47,357
Well, that's not really the point.

858
01:14:47,523 --> 01:14:51,152
Alexander's got 10 more years of school.
Will you be around for that?

859
01:14:51,319 --> 01:14:53,363
I can't put him
in a private school...

860
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:56,825
...and take him out again
on every passing whim of yours.

861
01:14:59,035 --> 01:15:02,706
Just tell me this. Do you picture us
getting married sometime?

862
01:15:02,873 --> 01:15:06,460
- When your divorce comes through?
- MurieI...

863
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:08,712
...marriage is...

864
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,883
I don't know.

865
01:15:13,049 --> 01:15:15,803
You don't, do you?
You don't know what you want.

866
01:15:15,969 --> 01:15:18,222
One minute you like me,
the next you don't.

867
01:15:18,388 --> 01:15:22,976
One minute you're ashamed of me, the
next I'm the best thing to happen to you.

868
01:15:23,143 --> 01:15:26,439
You think you can just
go along like this. No plans.

869
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:29,233
Maybe tomorrow you'll be here,
maybe you won't.

870
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:32,945
Maybe you'll just go on back to Sarah.

871
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:37,116
- All I'm saying is-
- All I'm saying is...

872
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:39,326
...take care what you promise my son.

873
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:42,413
Don't go making him promises
you don't intend to keep.

874
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:47,502
But I just want him to learn
how to subtract.

875
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:14,195
Shall I dry?

876
01:16:14,988 --> 01:16:17,198
Just tell me this, Macon.
Be honest.

877
01:16:17,365 --> 01:16:19,451
Why can't we get married in the fall?

878
01:16:19,952 --> 01:16:22,287
You'll be separated a year then, Macon.

879
01:16:22,454 --> 01:16:26,458
Hey, MurieI, please,
I'm not ready for this.

880
01:16:27,793 --> 01:16:30,462
I don't think I ever will be.

881
01:16:34,466 --> 01:16:37,678
I don't think marriage
ought to be as common as it is.

882
01:16:37,845 --> 01:16:42,349
I really believe it ought to be
the exception to the rule.

883
01:16:42,516 --> 01:16:46,270
Perfect couples could marry, maybe...

884
01:16:46,437 --> 01:16:48,188
...but who's a perfect couple?

885
01:16:48,396 --> 01:16:51,734
- You and Sarah, I suppose.
- No, no.

886
01:16:51,901 --> 01:16:55,988
You are so selfish.
You are so self-centred!

887
01:16:56,154 --> 01:17:00,201
You have all these fancy reasons
for never doing a single thing I want!

888
01:17:20,846 --> 01:17:23,265
Macon's sister, Rose, is getting married.

889
01:17:23,433 --> 01:17:25,977
You understand that, Alexander?

890
01:17:29,648 --> 01:17:32,192
Now, don't be nervous, honey.

891
01:17:34,611 --> 01:17:36,988
You're it! I'm coming to get you!

892
01:17:37,196 --> 01:17:39,699
- No, you're not!
- You're it!

893
01:17:39,866 --> 01:17:42,452
- Is that right?
- Yes, I did.

894
01:17:44,746 --> 01:17:48,458
- What's this?
- Hey, look! Something for you.

895
01:17:48,791 --> 01:17:50,461
Look out!

896
01:17:53,379 --> 01:17:54,798
Hello, Macon.

897
01:17:56,634 --> 01:18:00,721
- Hello, Sarah.
- Turned out to be a beautiful day.

898
01:18:03,265 --> 01:18:07,060
Yes. Yes.
I worried when it rained last night.

899
01:18:08,395 --> 01:18:10,523
How've you been, Macon?

900
01:18:10,689 --> 01:18:12,774
I've been all right.

901
01:18:14,652 --> 01:18:16,237
How have you been?

902
01:18:17,404 --> 01:18:19,073
Fine.

903
01:18:19,866 --> 01:18:21,742
Well, good.

904
01:18:24,579 --> 01:18:27,331
I know you're living with someone.

905
01:18:28,248 --> 01:18:31,461
Yes, actually.

906
01:18:34,839 --> 01:18:36,340
Yes, I am.

907
01:18:36,925 --> 01:18:39,760
Rose told me when she invited me.

908
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:42,680
- How about you?
- Me?

909
01:18:42,847 --> 01:18:46,767
- Are you living with anyone?
- Not really.

910
01:18:49,271 --> 01:18:50,729
We're ready now.

911
01:18:50,897 --> 01:18:53,942
Sarah's my matron of honour.
Did I happen to mention that?

912
01:18:54,442 --> 01:18:56,611
No, you didn't.

913
01:18:58,446 --> 01:19:00,365
Let's go.

914
01:19:55,338 --> 01:19:57,548
Welcome, friends.

915
01:19:57,757 --> 01:20:00,635
We are gathered here today
in this lovely garden...

916
01:20:00,843 --> 01:20:04,179
...to join Rose Anne Leary
and Julian Hedge...

917
01:20:04,347 --> 01:20:06,724
...in holy matrimony.

918
01:20:06,933 --> 01:20:12,313
In turbulent, troubling times, a good
marriage can be the one safe place...

919
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:15,024
...we know we can go.

920
01:20:15,608 --> 01:20:20,363
Once we've been to that place,
known that peace...

921
01:20:21,197 --> 01:20:23,742
...we can never forget it.

922
01:20:45,889 --> 01:20:48,600
I have to be able
to tell you what I want, Macon.

923
01:20:48,725 --> 01:20:51,186
- I have to.
- You can.

924
01:20:51,353 --> 01:20:54,439
But without being afraid
you'll go away.

925
01:20:54,607 --> 01:20:59,570
- I can't be afraid all the time.
- It's all right, I'm not going away.

926
01:21:00,154 --> 01:21:02,239
You are. You're all packed.

927
01:21:02,406 --> 01:21:07,244
I'm going to Canada tomorrow,
remember? It's just my work.

928
01:21:10,164 --> 01:21:12,249
Don't leave me, Macon.

929
01:21:15,545 --> 01:21:17,839
Go to sleep, MurieI.

930
01:21:20,716 --> 01:21:22,885
Sleep.

931
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:39,235
<i>- Yes.
- Macon?</i>

932
01:21:39,402 --> 01:21:42,113
<i>- Sarah.
- I didn't get you at a bad time, did I?</i>

933
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:44,490
No. Is anything wrong?

934
01:21:44,699 --> 01:21:46,576
No.

935
01:21:46,785 --> 01:21:49,412
Well, actually...

936
01:21:49,579 --> 01:21:51,998
...my lease runs out
at the end of the month...

937
01:21:52,165 --> 01:21:54,292
...and I haven't found a new apartment.

938
01:21:54,459 --> 01:21:56,044
<i>Yes?</i>

939
01:21:56,377 --> 01:21:59,297
So I was wondering
if it would be all right with you...

940
01:21:59,464 --> 01:22:04,052
...if I moved back into our house,
just as a place to stay for a while.

941
01:22:04,969 --> 01:22:06,847
But...

942
01:22:08,056 --> 01:22:11,976
...the house is a mess. Something
happened to it over the winter.

943
01:22:12,186 --> 01:22:14,730
<i>- Pipes burst, or something-
- Yeah, I know.</i>

944
01:22:15,105 --> 01:22:18,359
I talked to your brothers.
I went over to the house.

945
01:22:18,525 --> 01:22:21,737
<i>- Rose told me she'd been over, and she-
- Rose?</i>

946
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:23,822
Yeah. She's back at your brothers'.

947
01:22:24,197 --> 01:22:27,284
<i>- She's what?
- She's living there for a while.</i>

948
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:28,785
Really.

949
01:22:28,994 --> 01:22:31,204
Charles and Porter weren't eating right.

950
01:22:31,372 --> 01:22:34,875
<i>So is Julian living alone now, or what?</i>

951
01:22:35,042 --> 01:22:39,087
Yes. She takes casseroles
over to him at the apartment.

952
01:22:39,922 --> 01:22:41,841
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

953
01:22:42,007 --> 01:22:46,137
<i>- About what?
- About my using the house.</i>

954
01:22:51,601 --> 01:22:54,812
Well, yes. Fine. Of course.

955
01:22:55,813 --> 01:22:59,317
Good. Oh, incidentally...

956
01:22:59,484 --> 01:23:04,155
...the papers came through
from the lawyers, about the divorce.

957
01:23:06,574 --> 01:23:10,954
<i>Yeah, it was kind of a shock,
seeing them in black and white.</i>

958
01:23:11,329 --> 01:23:14,332
Didn't take into account
the feelings of the thing. I...

959
01:23:14,499 --> 01:23:17,377
<i>- I guess I hadn't expected that.
- Yes.</i>

960
01:23:17,543 --> 01:23:20,004
Certainly. That seems
a natural reaction.

961
01:23:20,172 --> 01:23:25,218
So, anyway, good luck
with the house, Sarah. Goodbye.

962
01:23:31,641 --> 01:23:34,186
<i>- How's the weather in Edmonton?
- It's kind of gray.</i>

963
01:23:34,353 --> 01:23:36,855
Here it's sunny. Sunny and humid.

964
01:23:37,021 --> 01:23:42,069
Here the air is so dry that rain
disappears before it hits the ground.

965
01:23:42,235 --> 01:23:44,779
<i>- Really?
- You can see it above the plains.</i>

966
01:23:44,947 --> 01:23:50,243
It looks like stripes that just fade away
about halfway down from the sky.

967
01:23:51,786 --> 01:23:54,498
I wish I were there
to watch it with you.

968
01:23:59,253 --> 01:24:02,006
Well, I moved back into the house.

969
01:24:02,214 --> 01:24:04,383
Mostly I just stay upstairs.

970
01:24:05,051 --> 01:24:07,720
<i>You wouldn't believe how lonely it is.</i>

971
01:24:09,263 --> 01:24:11,266
Macon, do you-?

972
01:24:12,850 --> 01:24:16,187
What's that person's name,
the one you live with?

973
01:24:18,689 --> 01:24:20,650
MurieI.

974
01:24:22,568 --> 01:24:25,738
Do you plan on staying
with MurieI forever?

975
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:30,619
I really couldn't say.

976
01:24:35,831 --> 01:24:38,292
<i>Macon, come home.</i>

977
01:24:39,336 --> 01:24:41,630
<i>Let's try again.</i>

978
01:26:40,250 --> 01:26:44,588
- I like this, Macon.
- Me too, sweetheart.

979
01:26:52,929 --> 01:26:56,767
You know what I missed most when
we were separated? Little things.

980
01:26:56,934 --> 01:27:00,229
The Saturday errands. Even the
things that used to bother me...

981
01:27:00,437 --> 01:27:03,774
...like your taking forever
in a hardware store.

982
01:27:04,525 --> 01:27:09,154
Macon, I think when people
have been married as long as we have...

983
01:27:09,322 --> 01:27:12,074
...maybe it's just meant to be.

984
01:27:12,908 --> 01:27:17,205
Anything different
just doesn't feel right.

985
01:27:26,631 --> 01:27:29,342
Rose, why haven't you
moved back with Julian?

986
01:27:29,509 --> 01:27:33,596
Sarah, you wouldn't believe the state
the boys were in when I came back here.

987
01:27:33,763 --> 01:27:36,766
They were living in their pajamas
to avoid doing laundry.

988
01:27:36,974 --> 01:27:40,479
- They were eating gorp for supper.
- I won't even ask what gorp is.

989
01:27:40,645 --> 01:27:43,189
It's a mixture of wheat germ
and nuts and dried fruit.

990
01:27:43,357 --> 01:27:47,026
What about your apartment?
What about Julian?

991
01:27:48,153 --> 01:27:51,907
You know, I kept losing that apartment
every time I turned around.

992
01:27:52,074 --> 01:27:56,328
I would head east to the grocery
store and turn west to get back again...

993
01:27:56,495 --> 01:27:59,289
...and I would always be wrong.
Always.

994
01:27:59,497 --> 01:28:03,835
I mean, the apartment building
would've worked to the north somehow.

995
01:28:29,821 --> 01:28:32,365
<i>Macon, are you really doing this?</i>

996
01:28:32,949 --> 01:28:36,828
You mean to tell me you can just
use a person up and move on?

997
01:28:37,036 --> 01:28:40,707
You think I'm some kind of bottle
of something you don't need anymore?

998
01:28:41,458 --> 01:28:44,168
<i>Is that the way you see me, Macon?</i>

999
01:28:58,099 --> 01:29:01,352
Thought I'd bring you
the materials for Paris.

1000
01:29:17,745 --> 01:29:21,123
Yeah, it just arrived this morning.

1001
01:29:23,917 --> 01:29:27,046
Do you think that Rose
is not coming back?

1002
01:29:28,881 --> 01:29:33,093
She's worried about the boys.
They're eating glop or something.

1003
01:29:33,260 --> 01:29:36,430
Those aren't boys, Macon,
they're men in their 40s.

1004
01:29:37,723 --> 01:29:42,311
- I'm afraid that she's left me.
- No, no, you can't be sure of that.

1005
01:29:42,477 --> 01:29:46,482
And not even for any reason.
Our marriage was working out fine...

1006
01:29:46,649 --> 01:29:50,444
...but she wore herself a groove
in that house and she can't help...

1007
01:29:50,611 --> 01:29:53,030
...but swerve back into it.

1008
01:29:53,406 --> 01:29:56,451
At least, I can't think of
any other explanation.

1009
01:29:56,617 --> 01:29:58,953
Well, that sounds about right.

1010
01:30:10,965 --> 01:30:13,425
Why don't you give her a job, Julian?

1011
01:30:14,176 --> 01:30:17,597
- A job?
- Yeah. Show her that office of yours.

1012
01:30:17,764 --> 01:30:20,183
That filing system
you never get sorted...

1013
01:30:20,349 --> 01:30:24,145
...the secretary chewing her gum
and forgetting appointments.

1014
01:30:24,313 --> 01:30:26,773
Don't you think Rose
could take all that in hand?

1015
01:30:27,941 --> 01:30:30,944
- Well, sure, but-
- Call her up.

1016
01:30:31,152 --> 01:30:34,489
Tell her your business is going
to pieces. Ask her to come in...

1017
01:30:34,656 --> 01:30:36,616
...and get things organized.

1018
01:30:38,493 --> 01:30:40,746
Get things under control.

1019
01:30:42,456 --> 01:30:46,626
Put it that way.
Use those words.

1020
01:30:46,794 --> 01:30:49,504
Get things under control, tell her.

1021
01:30:53,843 --> 01:30:55,636
Then sit back and wait.

1022
01:30:58,055 --> 01:30:59,431
Of course, what do I know?

1023
01:31:00,265 --> 01:31:02,476
No, you're right.

1024
01:31:05,228 --> 01:31:07,439
You're absolutely right.

1025
01:31:13,529 --> 01:31:15,239
What do you think of
the sofa bed?

1026
01:31:15,406 --> 01:31:18,367
It's okay. It's good.

1027
01:31:22,538 --> 01:31:24,456
How about the fabric?

1028
01:31:24,623 --> 01:31:26,834
Seems very nice.

1029
01:31:27,293 --> 01:31:29,379
Honestly, Macon, what's come over you?

1030
01:31:29,545 --> 01:31:31,547
You used to be downright finicky.

1031
01:31:31,715 --> 01:31:33,383
Well, it's...

1032
01:31:33,549 --> 01:31:37,637
...fine, Sarah. It looks very nice.

1033
01:31:37,803 --> 01:31:39,556
Let's make it up.

1034
01:32:13,757 --> 01:32:16,635
Why don't we give the bed a trial run?

1035
01:32:17,093 --> 01:32:20,222
- Trial run?
- Yeah.

1036
01:33:00,471 --> 01:33:02,139
Macon?

1037
01:33:03,474 --> 01:33:07,311
You've never asked if I slept with
anyone while we were separated.

1038
01:33:09,356 --> 01:33:11,274
Don't you want to know?

1039
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:14,653
No.

1040
01:33:14,944 --> 01:33:17,823
- I think you'd wonder.
- Well, I don't.

1041
01:33:20,784 --> 01:33:22,494
Macon, the trouble with you is-

1042
01:33:22,661 --> 01:33:24,955
Sarah? Look, don't even start.

1043
01:33:25,121 --> 01:33:27,791
By God, if that doesn't
sum up everything...

1044
01:33:27,958 --> 01:33:29,334
...that's wrong with being married.

1045
01:33:29,543 --> 01:33:31,920
Macon, the trouble
with you is...

1046
01:33:32,421 --> 01:33:36,007
...I know you better than you
know yourself, Macon.

1047
01:33:39,511 --> 01:33:42,973
The trouble with you is,
you don't believe in people opening up.

1048
01:33:43,139 --> 01:33:46,602
You think everyone should stay
in their own little sealed package.

1049
01:33:46,768 --> 01:33:50,021
Okay. Let's say that that's true.

1050
01:33:50,188 --> 01:33:54,902
Let's say for now that you do know what
the trouble with me is, that nothing...

1051
01:33:55,069 --> 01:33:58,114
...that I might feel
could surprise you.

1052
01:33:58,864 --> 01:34:03,077
And that the reason I don't want to hear
about this thing is that I can't open up!

1053
01:34:03,243 --> 01:34:05,371
If we agree on all that,
can we drop it?!

1054
01:34:24,181 --> 01:34:27,184
<i>Flight 615, service from
Baltimore to Paris.</i>

1055
01:34:27,394 --> 01:34:29,270
<i>If you need help
with your luggage...</i>

1056
01:34:29,478 --> 01:34:33,274
<i>...the flight attendants
will be happy to assist you.</i>

1057
01:34:45,287 --> 01:34:46,662
MurieI.

1058
01:34:46,955 --> 01:34:48,498
I'm going to France.

1059
01:34:49,082 --> 01:34:51,167
But you can't!

1060
01:34:51,668 --> 01:34:53,920
Excuse me. Can I get by?

1061
01:35:24,118 --> 01:35:26,495
- MurieI, what in-?
- You don't own this plane.

1062
01:35:26,662 --> 01:35:29,540
- You don't own Paris, either.
- I don't understand this.

1063
01:35:29,707 --> 01:35:31,709
How could you afford the fare?

1064
01:35:31,876 --> 01:35:32,918
I borrowed.

1065
01:35:33,252 --> 01:35:36,630
But the point is, why, MurieI?
Why are you doing this?

1066
01:35:37,756 --> 01:35:39,216
You need to have me around.

1067
01:35:39,509 --> 01:35:40,885
What?

1068
01:35:41,052 --> 01:35:43,679
You were falling to pieces
before you had me.

1069
01:36:30,393 --> 01:36:32,855
Your room is bigger than mine is.

1070
01:36:34,022 --> 01:36:36,191
I have a better view, though.

1071
01:36:36,524 --> 01:36:40,112
Just think. We're really in Paris.

1072
01:36:40,529 --> 01:36:44,157
The bus driver said it might rain,
but I said I didn't care.

1073
01:36:44,367 --> 01:36:47,995
- Rain or shine, it's Paris.
- How did you know which bus to take?

1074
01:36:48,161 --> 01:36:50,414
I brought along your guidebook.

1075
01:36:51,164 --> 01:36:54,627
- Wanna go for breakfast?
- No, I don't. I can't.

1076
01:36:54,794 --> 01:36:56,838
You better leave, MurieI.

1077
01:36:58,339 --> 01:36:59,966
Okay.

1078
01:37:13,063 --> 01:37:15,856
Hello? Hello?

1079
01:37:16,023 --> 01:37:19,610
Oh, for crying out loud.

1080
01:37:32,123 --> 01:37:33,500
Hello?

1081
01:37:33,708 --> 01:37:35,085
<i>Sarah?</i>

1082
01:37:35,251 --> 01:37:37,420
Macon, where are you?
What's the matter?

1083
01:37:38,379 --> 01:37:41,341
Nothing's the matter,
I just felt like talking to you.

1084
01:37:42,967 --> 01:37:44,511
What time is it?

1085
01:37:44,677 --> 01:37:48,056
<i>I know it's early.
I'm sorry I woke you.</i>

1086
01:37:48,223 --> 01:37:49,974
<i>I wanted to hear your voice.</i>

1087
01:37:50,141 --> 01:37:52,769
There's some kind
of static on the line.

1088
01:37:53,354 --> 01:37:55,272
Will you be gardening today?

1089
01:37:55,438 --> 01:37:56,523
<i>What?</i>

1090
01:37:56,690 --> 01:37:58,608
Gardening?

1091
01:37:59,652 --> 01:38:02,404
<i>It depends on whether it's sunny.</i>

1092
01:38:02,571 --> 01:38:05,074
I wish I were there.
I could help you.

1093
01:38:06,659 --> 01:38:10,371
Macon, you hate gardening.
Are you all right?

1094
01:38:10,538 --> 01:38:12,456
<i>Yes, I'm fine.</i>

1095
01:38:12,915 --> 01:38:14,708
Well, how was the flight over?

1096
01:38:14,875 --> 01:38:17,920
<i>Oh, the flight.</i>

1097
01:38:18,587 --> 01:38:20,255
Goodness...

1098
01:38:22,675 --> 01:38:25,970
I guess I was so busy reading
I didn't really notice.

1099
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:29,974
<i>Maybe you have jet lag.</i>

1100
01:38:31,559 --> 01:38:33,853
Yes, maybe I do.

1101
01:38:42,611 --> 01:38:47,534
<i>Don't fall for prix fixe.
It's like a mother saying, Eat, eat.</i>

1102
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:50,411
<i>All those courses forced on you.</i>

1103
01:39:09,139 --> 01:39:12,351
- Look! See what all I bought!
- MurieI...

1104
01:39:12,559 --> 01:39:15,521
...have you lost your senses?
What must this have cost?

1105
01:39:15,687 --> 01:39:17,690
Nothing, or next to nothing.

1106
01:39:17,856 --> 01:39:21,026
I found a place that's, like,
the granddaddy of garage sales.

1107
01:39:21,193 --> 01:39:22,902
You say something's too expensive...

1108
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:25,364
...they lower the price
till it's cheap enough.

1109
01:39:25,572 --> 01:39:29,535
I saw this leather coat I would've killed
for, but the man wanted 90 francs.

1110
01:39:29,743 --> 01:39:32,037
Ninety francs is $ 15 or so.

1111
01:39:32,871 --> 01:39:35,874
Really? I thought francs and dollars
were about the same.

1112
01:39:36,334 --> 01:39:38,168
No.

1113
01:39:38,335 --> 01:39:40,838
Well, then these things
were super bargains.

1114
01:39:41,047 --> 01:39:42,923
I'll take this to my room
so we can go eat.

1115
01:39:43,174 --> 01:39:45,551
No, I can't.

1116
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:49,430
Macon, what harm would it do
to have supper with me?

1117
01:39:49,597 --> 01:39:52,307
I'm someone from home
you've run into in Paris.

1118
01:39:52,475 --> 01:39:54,643
Can't we have a bite together?

1119
01:39:59,566 --> 01:40:02,151
Careful, those aren't
the Whoppers you're used to.

1120
01:40:02,359 --> 01:40:05,780
You'll wanna scrape off
the extra pickle and onion.

1121
01:40:10,242 --> 01:40:12,746
Who's looking after Alexander?

1122
01:40:13,621 --> 01:40:15,415
Different people.

1123
01:40:17,417 --> 01:40:20,920
What different people?
I hope you haven't just parked him.

1124
01:40:21,088 --> 01:40:22,922
Relax, he's fine.

1125
01:40:23,089 --> 01:40:27,135
Claire has him in the daytime and then
Bernice comes in and cooks supper.

1126
01:40:27,302 --> 01:40:31,598
And any time Claire has a date with
the general, the twins will take him.

1127
01:40:31,806 --> 01:40:33,099
Or...

1128
01:40:33,266 --> 01:40:36,770
...if the twins can't, the general says
he's welcome to go with...

1129
01:40:36,895 --> 01:40:38,813
...him and Claire to the movies.

1130
01:40:38,981 --> 01:40:42,818
Long as it's not, like,
too adult of a movie.

1131
01:40:53,954 --> 01:40:55,706
- Macon?
- Yes, MurieI?

1132
01:40:55,872 --> 01:40:58,041
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Tomorrow...

1133
01:40:58,208 --> 01:41:02,880
...I'm going out of Paris altogether.
Tomorrow I start on the other cities.

1134
01:41:03,047 --> 01:41:04,256
You're going without me?

1135
01:41:04,465 --> 01:41:07,176
This is high-speed travel,
MurieI, not fun.

1136
01:41:07,342 --> 01:41:09,636
I'm waking up at crack of dawn.

1137
01:41:09,803 --> 01:41:11,472
Take me anyway.

1138
01:41:16,853 --> 01:41:18,896
You don't have to decide right now.

1139
01:41:19,063 --> 01:41:22,567
You can think about it tonight
and tell me if I can go tomorrow.

1140
01:41:24,485 --> 01:41:26,446
Good night, MurieI.

1141
01:42:06,862 --> 01:42:09,531
MurieI Pritchett.

1142
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:45,902
No.

1143
01:43:14,598 --> 01:43:16,141
Macon?

1144
01:43:20,979 --> 01:43:22,689
Macon?

1145
01:43:24,190 --> 01:43:25,442
Darn it.

1146
01:43:25,859 --> 01:43:28,194
Why did you go without me?

1147
01:43:29,904 --> 01:43:32,283
Macon, when are you gonna change?

1148
01:43:40,332 --> 01:43:42,668
Businessman's Press.

1149
01:43:43,294 --> 01:43:46,963
<i>This is Macon Leary.
To whom am I speaking?</i>

1150
01:43:47,131 --> 01:43:49,174
Oh, Macon!

1151
01:43:49,342 --> 01:43:50,509
<i>Rose?</i>

1152
01:43:50,676 --> 01:43:53,136
- Yes, it's me.
- What are you doing there?

1153
01:43:53,304 --> 01:43:54,430
I work here now.

1154
01:43:54,638 --> 01:43:58,308
I'm putting things in order.
You wouldn't believe this place.

1155
01:43:58,893 --> 01:44:01,312
Rose, my back has gone out on me.

1156
01:44:01,478 --> 01:44:04,440
<i>Oh, no. Of all times.
Are you still in Paris?</i>

1157
01:44:04,606 --> 01:44:06,150
Yes. So I was wondering-

1158
01:44:06,316 --> 01:44:08,986
<i>Don't you worry.
I'll take care of everything.</i>

1159
01:44:09,153 --> 01:44:10,488
<i>Have you seen a doctor?</i>

1160
01:44:10,654 --> 01:44:13,073
Doctors don't help, just bed rest.

1161
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:15,618
<i>Well, rest, then, Macon.</i>

1162
01:44:23,334 --> 01:44:24,835
Sarah.

1163
01:44:25,170 --> 01:44:27,004
Hello, Macon.

1164
01:44:29,633 --> 01:44:32,052
Everything's taken care of.

1165
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:34,429
I'll make your day trips for you.

1166
01:44:34,596 --> 01:44:36,514
We've rescheduled the other cities.

1167
01:44:36,681 --> 01:44:39,100
I start on them the day after tomorrow.

1168
01:44:40,018 --> 01:44:41,686
How did you get here so soon?

1169
01:44:41,894 --> 01:44:44,314
Rose. She's a wizard.

1170
01:44:44,523 --> 01:44:49,402
She's revamped that entire office.
You would not believe it.

1171
01:44:50,987 --> 01:44:52,364
<i>Merci.</i>

1172
01:44:52,572 --> 01:44:55,409
- I have a pill from Dr. Levitt.
- I don't take pills.

1173
01:44:55,617 --> 01:44:57,243
This time you do.

1174
01:44:57,410 --> 01:45:00,122
You're gonna get all
the sleep you can...

1175
01:45:00,288 --> 01:45:03,626
...so that your back
has a chance to heal.

1176
01:45:06,378 --> 01:45:07,630
Swallow.

1177
01:45:24,897 --> 01:45:26,523
Hi.

1178
01:45:29,735 --> 01:45:32,863
- How do you feel?
- Okay.

1179
01:45:33,655 --> 01:45:35,199
Here's your next pill.

1180
01:45:35,366 --> 01:45:39,704
Those things are deadly.
They really knock me out.

1181
01:45:40,413 --> 01:45:41,873
Open.

1182
01:45:48,254 --> 01:45:49,922
Macon?

1183
01:45:51,257 --> 01:45:53,884
I saw that woman friend of yours.

1184
01:45:54,803 --> 01:45:59,140
She saw me too.
She seemed very surprised.

1185
01:46:02,602 --> 01:46:04,645
Sarah, this is not the way it looks.

1186
01:46:05,188 --> 01:46:07,064
How is it? I'd like to hear.

1187
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:09,109
She came over here on her own.

1188
01:46:09,275 --> 01:46:12,779
I didn't even know it till
just before the plane took off.

1189
01:46:13,196 --> 01:46:16,783
She followed me, I swear it. I told her.

1190
01:46:16,950 --> 01:46:19,703
I didn't want her along.
I told her it was no use.

1191
01:46:20,579 --> 01:46:22,956
You didn't know till just
before you took off?

1192
01:46:23,164 --> 01:46:24,249
I swear it.

1193
01:46:27,168 --> 01:46:29,296
Do you believe me?

1194
01:46:31,506 --> 01:46:33,091
Yes.

1195
01:46:33,759 --> 01:46:35,635
I believe you.

1196
01:46:42,517 --> 01:46:44,227
Look who's up.

1197
01:46:45,146 --> 01:46:48,815
I brought you a snack,
some fresh fruit and things.

1198
01:46:49,316 --> 01:46:51,986
That's very nice of you, Sarah.

1199
01:46:52,153 --> 01:46:57,032
I was thinking, after I finish these trips,
if your back's feeling better...

1200
01:46:57,199 --> 01:46:58,993
...maybe we could go sightseeing.

1201
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:00,911
- Fine.
- Second honeymoon, sort of.

1202
01:47:04,624 --> 01:47:07,001
We can change your tickets
to a later date.

1203
01:47:07,168 --> 01:47:10,672
Your reservation's for tomorrow.
I don't think you can manage that.

1204
01:47:10,838 --> 01:47:13,216
- Did I tell you about Julian?
- No, what?

1205
01:47:13,382 --> 01:47:15,510
He moved in with Rose
and your brothers.

1206
01:47:15,676 --> 01:47:17,970
- What?
- He's living there.

1207
01:47:18,179 --> 01:47:21,140
He plays Vaccination
every night after supper.

1208
01:47:21,348 --> 01:47:22,976
I'll be damned.

1209
01:47:25,061 --> 01:47:26,855
Apple cider.

1210
01:47:27,438 --> 01:47:29,774
Here you are.
To a second honeymoon.

1211
01:47:29,942 --> 01:47:32,277
- Second honeymoon.
- Eighteen more years.

1212
01:47:32,485 --> 01:47:34,445
- Eighteen.
- Or would you say 17?

1213
01:47:34,613 --> 01:47:36,573
No. It's 18, all right.

1214
01:47:36,739 --> 01:47:38,742
We sort of skipped this past year.

1215
01:47:38,908 --> 01:47:41,036
- It can still be 18.
- You think so?

1216
01:47:41,202 --> 01:47:44,122
I consider this last year
just another stage in our marriage.

1217
01:47:44,289 --> 01:47:46,875
Don't worry. It's 18.

1218
01:47:49,545 --> 01:47:51,797
Just tell me one thing, Macon.

1219
01:47:52,381 --> 01:47:54,466
Was the little boy the attraction?

1220
01:47:56,635 --> 01:47:59,388
The fact she had a child.
Is that what attracted you?

1221
01:47:59,555 --> 01:48:03,767
Sarah, I swear to you, I had no idea
she was planning to follow me over here.

1222
01:48:03,976 --> 01:48:06,186
Oh, no, I realize that. I was just...

1223
01:48:06,354 --> 01:48:10,233
- ...wondering about the child question.
- What child question?

1224
01:48:10,399 --> 01:48:13,068
Yeah. Remember when you said...

1225
01:48:13,235 --> 01:48:15,112
...that we could have another baby?

1226
01:48:15,320 --> 01:48:18,825
Oh, well, that was-
I don't know what that was.

1227
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:21,410
I was thinking maybe you were right.

1228
01:48:21,577 --> 01:48:26,624
What? No. Lord.
Sarah, it was a terrible idea.

1229
01:48:32,463 --> 01:48:34,882
So the little boy wasn't the reason.

1230
01:48:37,593 --> 01:48:39,470
What are we talking about here?

1231
01:48:39,638 --> 01:48:42,306
Can't you just answer me?
I'd like to understand.

1232
01:48:42,473 --> 01:48:46,019
It's over! Can't we close the lid on it?
I don't cross-examine you.

1233
01:48:46,185 --> 01:48:47,854
Nobody's following me to Paris!

1234
01:48:48,271 --> 01:48:51,441
Would I blame you if someone got
on a plane without you knowing?

1235
01:48:51,608 --> 01:48:53,276
Before it left the ground?

1236
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:55,821
Pardon? What-? Sarah!

1237
01:48:56,321 --> 01:48:58,198
Before it left, you saw her.

1238
01:48:58,365 --> 01:49:01,034
You could have said,
No. Stop this. Get off...

1239
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:03,579
...I never want to see you again.

1240
01:49:03,787 --> 01:49:05,788
You think I own the airline, Sarah?

1241
01:49:05,956 --> 01:49:09,960
You could have stopped her if you
wanted. You could have taken steps.

1242
01:49:10,168 --> 01:49:12,003
For once!

1243
01:51:08,289 --> 01:51:10,082
Sarah?

1244
01:51:26,724 --> 01:51:29,269
Sarah, I'm going back to MurieI.

1245
01:51:43,449 --> 01:51:45,910
I knew what you were going to say.

1246
01:51:48,038 --> 01:51:51,750
I'm sorry, Sarah.
I tried, but I can't make this work.

1247
01:51:53,835 --> 01:51:58,298
You were right about me,
I haven't taken steps very often.

1248
01:51:59,173 --> 01:52:02,135
But maybe it's not too late
for me to start.

1249
01:52:04,679 --> 01:52:07,057
I thought this might happen.

1250
01:52:08,601 --> 01:52:11,603
I don't know why it's
no good for us anymore.

1251
01:52:13,938 --> 01:52:17,234
I'm beginning to think it's not
just how much you love someone.

1252
01:52:17,401 --> 01:52:19,653
Maybe what matters is...

1253
01:52:20,153 --> 01:52:22,990
...who you are when you're with them.

1254
01:52:24,325 --> 01:52:26,827
Was it a mistake to try again?

1255
01:52:27,703 --> 01:52:32,291
No. It's wrong to think
we can plan everything.

1256
01:52:33,751 --> 01:52:36,712
As though it were a business trip.

1257
01:52:38,923 --> 01:52:43,719
I don't believe that anymore.
Things just happen.

1258
01:52:44,845 --> 01:52:48,641
I don't regret a minute
I've spent with you, Sarah.

1259
01:52:49,350 --> 01:52:51,352
When I saw you...

1260
01:52:52,687 --> 01:52:54,772
...at Rose's wedding...

1261
01:52:56,149 --> 01:52:59,069
...I knew that somehow
you'd recovered, that you'd...

1262
01:52:59,277 --> 01:53:01,238
...gone on with your life after Ethan.

1263
01:53:01,446 --> 01:53:04,449
Well, I'd tried, but I couldn't
do it on my own.

1264
01:53:05,867 --> 01:53:07,536
This woman...

1265
01:53:10,288 --> 01:53:12,999
...this odd woman...

1266
01:53:14,042 --> 01:53:15,919
...helped me.

1267
01:53:18,796 --> 01:53:22,842
She's given me another chance
to decide who I am.

1268
01:53:25,429 --> 01:53:28,474
To step out of the Leary groove...

1269
01:53:30,392 --> 01:53:32,311
...and stay out.

1270
01:53:35,230 --> 01:53:37,816
You don't need me anymore.

1271
01:53:39,318 --> 01:53:41,403
We both know that.

1272
01:53:45,657 --> 01:53:47,660
But I need her.

1273
01:56:11,890 --> 01:56:14,392
Charles de Gaulle Airport, s 'il vous plait.

1274
01:57:12,193 --> 01:57:15,493
Stop...
for that woman.
