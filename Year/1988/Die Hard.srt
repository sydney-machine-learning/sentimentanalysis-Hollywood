1
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,599
You don't like flying, do you?

2
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,728
What gives you that idea?

3
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:07,525
You want to know the secret
to surviving air travel?

4
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,738
After you get where you're going,
take off your shoes and socks.

5
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:16,409
Then you walk around on the rug barefoot
and make fists with your toes.

6
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,829
Fists with your toes?

7
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,165
I know. It sounds crazy.

8
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:24,333
Trust me.
I've been doing it for nine years.

9
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:28,129
Yes, sir! Better than a shower
and a hot cup of coffee.

10
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,131
OK.

11
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:41,934
It's OK. I'm a cop.

12
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:48,107
Trust me.
I've been doing this for 11 years.

13
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,902
On behalf of the captain and the crew,

14
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,070
I'd like to welcome you to Los Angeles.

15
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:55,948
Have a very merry Christmas.

16
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:15,009
flight 247 to Tucson
now boarding at gate 14.

17
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,108
How do you do?

18
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,456
Ladies and gentlemen...

19
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,999
Ladies and gentlemen!

20
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,253
I want to congratulate
each and every one of you

21
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:52,588
for making this
one of the greatest years

22
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,508
in the history
of the Nakatomi Corporation.

23
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,889
On behalf of the Chief
Executive Officer, Mr Ozu,

24
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:04,016
and the Board of Directors,

25
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:05,268
we thank you one and all

26
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,396
and wish you a merry Christmas
and a happy New Year!

27
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,983
Merry Christmas!
Happy New Year!

28
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,820
Hey, Holly.
What about dinner tonight?

29
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:18,531
Harry, it's Christmas Eve.

30
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:21,701
Families, stockings...

31
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,704
Chestnuts?

32
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:27,039
Rudolph and Frosty?

33
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,125
Any of these things ring a bell?

34
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,960
Actually, I was thinking more of

35
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,547
mulled wine, a nice aged Brie

36
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,842
and a roaring fireplace.
You know what I'm saying?

37
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:44,181
Ginny, it's 5.40. Go join the party.
Have some champagne.

38
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,726
You're making me feel
like Ebenezer Scrooge.

39
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:50,479
Thanks. Do you think the baby
can handle a little sip?

40
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,691
That baby's ready to tend bar.

41
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,568
Last chance.

42
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:56,903
Bye.

43
00:04:03,327 --> 00:04:06,287
McClane residence.
Lucy McClane speaking.

44
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:10,124
Hello, Lucy McClane.
This is your mother speaking.

45
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,753
Mommy!
when are you coming home?

46
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,379
Pretty soon.

47
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,090
You'll be in bed
when I get there, though.

48
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,509
Let me talk to Paulina, OK, hon?

49
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:24,680
And no snooping around the house
looking for presents.

50
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,767
Is Daddy coming home with you?

51
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,354
Well, we'll see what

52
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,814
Santa and Mommy can do, OK?

53
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,067
Put Paulina on. Bye, honey.

54
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,110
Paulina!

55
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:44,825
Hola, Mrs Holly.

56
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,620
Um, did Mr McClane call?

57
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:50,539
No, Mrs Holly. No telefono.

58
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:54,460
He probably didn't have time
before his flight.

59
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,380
It might be a good idea
to make up the spare bedroom

60
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,965
just in case.

61
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,676
Si, Mrs Holly. I do that already.

62
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,720
What would I do without you, Paulina?

63
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,664
California!

64
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:46,470
Hey, I'm John McClane.

65
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,555
Argyle.

66
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,515
I'm your limo driver.

67
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,061
Nice bear.

68
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,401
OK... Argyle.

69
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:02,361
What do we do now?

70
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:05,072
I was, uh, hoping you could tell me.

71
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,116
It's my first time driving a limo.

72
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,161
That's OK.
It's my first time riding in one.

73
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,289
Relax.
We got everything in this mug, man.

74
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,208
Look at this... CD, CB, TV,

75
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:19,670
telephone, full bar, VHS.

76
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,298
If your friend's hot to trot,

77
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,259
I know a few mama bears
we can hook up with.

78
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,179
Or is he married?

79
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,430
He's married.

80
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:30,514
OK.

81
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,853
Sorry about that.
It's the girl's day off.

82
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,147
I didn't know
you were gonna sit up front.

83
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,107
Your lady live out here?

84
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:41,734
About the past six months.

85
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,112
Meaning you still live in New York?

86
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,783
You always ask
this many questions, Argyle?

87
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:53,245
Sorry. I used to drive a cab
and people would expect a little chitchat.

88
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,999
- So, you divorced?
- Just drive the car, man.

89
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:00,795
Hey, come on. You divorced?
You separated? She beat you up?

90
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,802
She had a good job.
It turned into a great career.

91
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:12,431
- That meant she had to move here.
- You're very fast, Argyle.

92
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,101
So, why didn't you come?

93
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,313
Well?

94
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,607
Why didn't you come with her?

95
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,818
Because I'm a New York cop.

96
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:27,571
I got a backlog of New York scumbags
I'm still trying to put behind bars.

97
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,532
I can't just go that easy.

98
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,784
You thought she wasn't
gonna make it out here

99
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,955
and she'd come crawling back to you
so why bother to pack, right?

100
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,667
Like I said, you're very fast, Argyle.

101
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,211
Mind if we hear some tunes?

102
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,133
Hey, that'll work.

103
00:07:49,845 --> 00:07:51,262
Don't you got any Christmas music?

104
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,140
This is Christmas music.

105
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,921
So your lady sees you,
you run into each other's arms,

106
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:29,633
the music comes up
and you live happily ever after, right?

107
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,635
I can live with that.

108
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:36,182
So, if it doesn't work out,
you got a place to stay?

109
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,100
I'll find a place.

110
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,477
I tell you what...

111
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:45,107
I'll wait in the parking garage. You score,
give me a call on the car phone.

112
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:49,528
I'll take your bags to the desk.
You strike out, I'll get you a hotel.

113
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:53,782
- You're all right, Argyle.
- Remember that when you sign for the tip.

114
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,975
- Hi.
- Good evening.

115
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,311
I'm here to see Holly McClane.

116
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,313
Just type it in there.

117
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,695
Cute toy.

118
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,949
Yeah, if you have to take a leak,
it'll even help you find your zipper.

119
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,008
Christ.

120
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,225
- Thirtieth floor?
- The party.

121
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,102
They're the only ones
left in the building.

122
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,436
Take the express elevator.

123
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,522
Get off where you hear the noise.

124
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,274
Thanks.

125
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,168
- Champagne, sir?
- Yeah, thanks.

126
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,871
Oh, I'm sorry.

127
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,582
Hey! Merry Christmas!

128
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,379
Jesus.

129
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,131
Fuckin' California!

130
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,300
I couldn't agree with you more.

131
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:00,219
Why don't I talk to him right now?

132
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:04,139
Hi. I'm looking for...

133
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,141
- Holly Gennero.
- Yeah.

134
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,643
Then you must be John McClane.

135
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,145
Joe Takagi.
How was your ride in?

136
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,731
Nice. I have you to thank for that?

137
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,983
Seemed the least we could do.

138
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,737
- Quite a place you have here.
- It will be if we ever get it finished.

139
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,823
Still several floors under construction.

140
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,952
Holly went to fax some documents.
She should be back any minute.

141
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:28,414
In the meanwhile,
her office is back here.

142
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,292
Ellis?

143
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,547
I was just making a call.
This was the nearest phone.

144
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,966
I want you to meet John McClane,

145
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,676
Holly's husband.

146
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,220
Holly's policeman.

147
00:12:43,388 --> 00:12:45,806
Ellis is in charge
of international development.

148
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,808
Heard a lot about you.

149
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:50,102
You missed some.

150
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,980
Can I get you anything?

151
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:56,108
Food? Cake?
Some watered-down champagne?

152
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,610
No, thank you. I'm fine.

153
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,822
You throw quite a party.

154
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:05,826
I didn't realize they celebrated
Christmas in Japan.

155
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,035
We're flexible.

156
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,914
Pearl Harbor didn't work out,
so we got you with tape decks.

157
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,962
It's sort of a double celebration.
We closed a pretty big deal today

158
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,297
and a lot of it was due to Holly.
Right, Joe?

159
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,175
I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

160
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:27,890
John.

161
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,770
Have you met everyone?

162
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,564
We've been sticking him with spears.

163
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,316
Of course he has.

164
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:41,236
She was made for the business.
Tough as nails.

165
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,198
I was hoping you made that flight.

166
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,034
Show him the watch.

167
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,619
Later.

168
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:51,079
Show him. Are you embarrassed?

169
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,706
It's just a small token of appreciation

170
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,626
for all her hard work. It's a Rolex.

171
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,670
I'm sure I'll see it later.

172
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,715
Is there a place
where I could wash up?

173
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,300
Sure.

174
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,192
You have to forgive Ellis.

175
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,028
He gets very depressed
this time of year.

176
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,615
He thought he was
God's greatest gift, you know?

177
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,367
I know the type.

178
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,370
I think he's got his eye on you.

179
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:35,541
That's OK. I have my eye
on his private bathroom.

180
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:39,211
Where are you staying?
Things happened so fast

181
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,297
I didn't get a chance
to ask you on the phone.

182
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,758
Cappy Roberts retired out here.

183
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:45,968
Oh, yeah?

184
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,427
He said I could bunk with him.

185
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,013
Cappy retired, huh?
Where's he live?

186
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,600
- Romona.
- Ha! Pomona.

187
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,894
- Huh?
- Pomona.

188
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,021
- Pomona.
- Yeah.

189
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,275
You'll be in the car half the time.

190
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:06,071
Why don't we make it easy?
I have a spare bedroom.

191
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,740
It's not huge or anything, but

192
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:12,077
the kids would love to have you
at the house.

193
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,330
They would, huh?

194
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:20,252
I would, too.

195
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,257
Sorry.

196
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,099
I missed you.

197
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,026
Didn't miss my name, though, huh?

198
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:47,446
Except maybe
when you're signing checks?

199
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,657
Since when did you start using
Ms Gennero?

200
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:56,622
This is a Japanese company.
They figure a married woman's...

201
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,582
You are a married woman.

202
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,418
This conversation again?
We did this in July.

203
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,711
We never finished this conversation.

204
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,963
I had an opportunity. I had to take it.

205
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:07,466
No matter what it did to our marriage.

206
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,927
It only changed your idea
of our marriage.

207
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:12,679
You have no clue what my idea...

208
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:16,642
I know exactly what your idea
of our marriage should be.

209
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,810
Ms Gennero, I...

210
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,022
Excuse me.

211
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,066
Hi.

212
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,569
Um, Mr Takagi is looking for you.

213
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,072
He wants you to say something
to the troops.

214
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,490
Thank you.

215
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:37,329
Speech time.

216
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:39,623
Be back in a few minutes.

217
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,136
That was great, John.

218
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:56,014
Good job. Very mature.

219
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,399
So Kareem rebounds.

220
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,986
Feeds Worthy on the break,
over to AC, to Magic,

221
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,779
then back to Worthy.

222
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,490
Boom! Two points.

223
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:00,829
We're in.

224
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,813
Links,

225
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,567
rechts,

226
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,444
und wieder links.

227
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,476
Son of a bitch.

228
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,606
Fists with your toes.

229
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,472
Yeah, Argyle?

230
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,140
How's it going?

231
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,725
All right. Where are you?

232
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,770
Down at the garage.
What's with you and your lady?

233
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,106
The vote's not in yet.

234
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,825
- Hey, Bruder.
- Moment.

235
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,494
Nein! Nein! Nein!

236
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,014
Argyle?

237
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,683
Mac, you there? Hello?

238
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,277
You know the number. Use it.

239
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,330
Stay calm.
Everything's going to be fine.

240
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,457
Everything's going to be fine.

241
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,311
Shit!

242
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:46,401
Think.

243
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:08,506
Ladies and gentlemen.

244
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,767
Due to the Nakatomi Corporation's
legacy of greed around the globe

245
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:23,730
they're about to be taught a lesson
in the real use of power.

246
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,192
You will be witnesses.

247
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,778
Now

248
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:33,781
where is Mr Takagi?

249
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,370
Joseph Yashinobo Takagi,

250
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,124
born Kyoto, 1937.

251
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,709
Don't move.

252
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:49,297
Family emigrated to San Pedro,
California, 1939,

253
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:55,136
interned at Manzanar, 1942 to '43,

254
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,099
scholarship student,
University of California,

255
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,393
1955.

256
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,610
Law degree, Stanford, 1962.

257
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:14,572
MBA, Harvard, 1970.

258
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,243
President, Nakatomi Trading.

259
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,663
Vice Chairman,
Nakatomi Investment Group...

260
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,289
Enough.

261
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,000
And father

262
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,418
of five.

263
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,379
I am Takagi.

264
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,382
How do you do?

265
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,635
It's a pleasure to meet you.

266
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,608
OK, 32... construction,
33... computers.

267
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,124
Nice suit.

268
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,793
John Phillips, London.

269
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,547
I have two myself.

270
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,592
Rumor has it
Arafat buys his there.

271
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:24,267
- This way?
- On the left.

272
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:50,001
And when Alexander saw
the breadth of his domain

273
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,963
he wept, for there were
no more worlds to conquer.

274
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:01,346
The benefits of a classical education.

275
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:05,099
Ohh, that's beautiful.

276
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:09,937
I always enjoyed to make models
when I was a boy.

277
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:14,734
The exactness, the attention
to every conceivable detail.

278
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,986
It's beautiful.

279
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:20,865
Is this what this is all about?
Our project in Indonesia?

280
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,327
Contrary to what you people may think,

281
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,789
we're going to develop
that region, not exploit it.

282
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:32,293
I believe you.
I read the article in Forbes.

283
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,255
Mr Takagi,

284
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:41,094
I could talk about industrialization
and men's fashions all day

285
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:43,304
but I'm afraid work must intrude

286
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:46,599
and my associate here
has some questions for you.

287
00:28:47,518 --> 00:28:50,561
Sort of fill-in-the-blanks questions,
actually.

288
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,240
I don't have that code.

289
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,618
You broke in here
to access our computer?

290
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,703
Any information you could get

291
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,956
when they wake up in Tokyo,
they'll change it.

292
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,375
You won't be able to blackmail
our executives...

293
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:14,502
Sit... down!

294
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,850
Mr Takagi, I'm really not
interested in your computer.

295
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,606
But I need the code key

296
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:40,695
because I am interested
in the $640 million

297
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:45,116
in negotiable bearer bonds
that you have locked in your vault

298
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:48,453
and the computer
controls the vault.

299
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:51,789
You want money?

300
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,042
What kind of terrorists are you?

301
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,631
Who said we were terrorists?

302
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:22,987
The bonds represent, at most

303
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,741
10 days' operating capital
for your parent organization.

304
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,994
It's really no more
than a temporary inconvenience.

305
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,287
Now...

306
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,752
the code, please.

307
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,338
It's useless to you.

308
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:43,341
There are seven safeguards on our vault
and the code key's only one of them.

309
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,759
You'll never get it open.

310
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,720
Then there's no reason
not to tell it to us.

311
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,807
- I told you.
- It's not over yet.

312
00:30:56,939 --> 00:31:00,149
It's a very nice suit, Mr Takagi.

313
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,528
It would be a shame to ruin it.

314
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:09,033
I'm going to count to three.

315
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:12,286
There will not be a four.

316
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,873
Give me the code.

317
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:18,417
One,

318
00:31:21,255 --> 00:31:22,463
two,

319
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,968
- three.
- I don't know it.

320
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,428
Get on a jet to Tokyo
and ask the chairman.

321
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,847
You're just gonna have to kill me.

322
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:33,224
OK.

323
00:31:36,687 --> 00:31:38,437
We do it the hard way.

324
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:40,439
Tony, see if you can dispose of that.

325
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:44,527
Karl, you better check on Heinrich's work
up on the machine floor.

326
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:10,428
Nothing.

327
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:12,346
See to Heinrich.

328
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,099
Now

329
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,394
you can break the code?

330
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:22,565
You didn't bring me
for my charming personality.

331
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:31,490
Argyle, tell me you heard the shots.

332
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:33,159
You're calling the police right now.

333
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:36,120
Of course I'm still coming by later.

334
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:39,415
Sweetheart, have I ever lied to you?

335
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:42,460
My boss? He thinks
I'm on my way to Vegas.

336
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:45,630
Uli, get up on the pipes.

337
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,966
Marco, you go through here.

338
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:52,637
I'll throw you the cord.

339
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,477
Hans, we're on the roof.

340
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:12,948
Here.

341
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:17,578
Uli.

342
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,587
30 minutes to break the code,

343
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:31,842
two hours, two and a half hours
for the five mechanicals, at the minimum.

344
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:35,680
The 7th lock, however,
is out of my hands.

345
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,453
I'm sorry?

346
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,331
The 7th lock...
the electromagnetic seal.

347
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,210
You do understand the circuits
cannot be cut locally?

348
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:08,337
Trust me.

349
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:13,050
Why the fuck
didn't you stop him, John?

350
00:34:14,344 --> 00:34:17,138
'Cause then you'd be dead, too,
asshole.

351
00:34:17,264 --> 00:34:19,265
Think, goddamn it! Think!

352
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:33,654
We've got a fire alarm.

353
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,489
Call 911.

354
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:39,744
Give them the guard's name
and cancel the alarm.

355
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,328
Then disable the sys...

356
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,585
Eddie, on what floor
did the alarm go off?

357
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,172
Shall we go?

358
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,631
Nein.

359
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:04,852
Yes.

360
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,730
Hello, baby.
Come to Papa. Come on.

361
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,483
Ah ha ha ha!

362
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:14,695
Come on, baby.

363
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,071
Come on, baby. Come to Papa.

364
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:18,616
I'll kiss your fuckin' Dalmatian.

365
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,871
You stupid motherfuckers!
No! No!

366
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,290
Turn the fuckin' truck around!

367
00:35:59,908 --> 00:36:02,993
The fire has been called off, my friend.

368
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,251
No-one is coming to help you.

369
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:17,299
You might as well come out
and join the others.

370
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,012
I promise I won't hurt you.

371
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:54,295
Drop it, dickhead. It's the police.

372
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:56,380
You won't hurt me.

373
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,215
Yeah? Why not?

374
00:36:58,884 --> 00:37:00,426
Because you're a policeman.

375
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,720
There are rules for policemen.

376
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:06,307
Yeah, that's what my captain
keeps telling me.

377
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,626
Bet your ass I wish to proceed.

378
00:38:55,709 --> 00:38:57,126
Nine million terrorists in the world

379
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,671
and I got to kill one with feet
smaller than my sister.

380
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:52,973
I wanted this to be professional,

381
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,892
efficient, adult, cooperative.

382
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,602
Not a lot to ask.

383
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,063
Alas, your Mr Takagi
did not see it that way

384
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:02,816
so he won't be joining us
for the rest of his life.

385
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:06,779
We can go any way you want it.

386
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,116
You can walk out of here
or be carried out

387
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:15,579
but have no illusions...
we are in charge.

388
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:19,583
So... decide now, each of you

389
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,795
and please remember

390
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:26,340
we have left nothing to chance.

391
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:32,429
It's Tony!

392
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:36,350
Get them back!

393
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:48,112
Now I have a machine gun.

394
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:53,075
Ho... ho... ho.

395
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,871
A security guard we missed?

396
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:02,543
They're usually tired old policemen.
No, this is something else.

397
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,013
We have to do something, Hans.

398
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,306
Yes, we do.

399
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,351
Tell Karl his brother is dead.

400
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:21,478
Tell him to come down.

401
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,481
Karl... komm sofort.

402
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,526
Franco, Fritz, take the body upstairs

403
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,610
and out of sight.

404
00:41:28,695 --> 00:41:30,988
I don't want the hostages
to think too much.

405
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:33,949
Komm sofort. Schnell.

406
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:37,804
I want blood!

407
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,307
You'll have it, but let
Heinrich plant the detonators

408
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,809
and Theo prepare the vault.
After we call the police,

409
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:46,313
you can tear the building apart
looking for this man

410
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,691
but until then,
do not alter the plan!

411
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,985
And if he alters it?

412
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:58,909
What do you think?

413
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,871
Something's wrong.

414
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,331
Cops?

415
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,919
- John.
- John?

416
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,463
He can fuck this whole thing up.

417
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,006
What does he think he's doing?

418
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,132
His job.

419
00:43:14,217 --> 00:43:17,594
Bullshit.
His job's 3,000 miles away.

420
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:21,181
Without him, we still have
a chance to get out of here.

421
00:43:22,267 --> 00:43:24,101
Tell that to Takagi.

422
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,627
Mayday, Mayday,
anyone copying channel nine.

423
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,963
Terrorists have seized
the Nakatomi building

424
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,840
and are holding
at least 30 people hostage.

425
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,925
I repeat.
unknown number of terrorists

426
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:58,844
six or more
armed with automatic weapons

427
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,304
at Nakatomi Plaza,

428
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:01,388
Century City.

429
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,056
Where's the best place to transmit?

430
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,225
The roof!

431
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,643
Go! Go!

432
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,773
It's the same address
as that fire signal.

433
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,358
I'll handle it.

434
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,446
Attention, whoever you are,

435
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,740
this channel is reserved
for emergency calls only.

436
00:44:19,824 --> 00:44:22,951
No fucking shit, lady!
Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza?

437
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,342
No-one kills him but me.

438
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,511
They have already killed one hostage.

439
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:45,098
They are fortifying their positions
while you're jerkin' me off on the radio!

440
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,100
Sir, I've already told you.

441
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,102
This is a reserved channel.

442
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:53,148
If this is an emergency call,
dial 911 on your telephone.

443
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:56,401
Otherwise, I'll report this
as an FCC violation.

444
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:59,029
Fine! Report me!
Come the fuck down here and arrest me!

445
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:00,864
Just send the police now!

446
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,047
See if a black and white can drive by.

447
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,728
Thought you guys just ate donuts.

448
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,649
- They're for my wife.
- Yeah.

449
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,319
- She's pregnant.
- Yeah.

450
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,239
Bag it.

451
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:44,574
Big time.

452
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:48,745
Thanks.

453
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,209
Dispatch to 8-Lincoln-30. Over.

454
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,586
This is 8-Lincoln-30.

455
00:45:56,671 --> 00:46:00,632
Investigate a code two
at Nakatomi Plaza, Century City.

456
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,927
8-Lincoln-30 to Dispatch.
I'm on my way.

457
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,381
Girls.

458
00:48:19,981 --> 00:48:22,065
Shit! Where the fuck is it?

459
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:45,547
Oh, my God.

460
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:03,690
He's in the elevator shaft.

461
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:06,151
Perfect.

462
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:08,153
The elevators are locked off.
He can't escape.

463
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:09,946
Just shut him in
and come back down.

464
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:15,035
Oh, fuck.

465
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,168
Karl, the police are probably
on their way

466
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:24,419
already.

467
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:25,629
Karl?

468
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:47,817
Christ.

469
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:55,283
I can stall them,
but not if they hear gunshots.

470
00:49:55,368 --> 00:49:57,744
If you lock him in,
he'll be neutralized...

471
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:04,310
"Come out to the coast!"

472
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:07,063
"We'll get together,
have a few laughs."

473
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:16,698
Now I know
what a TV dinner feels like.

474
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:27,834
Such!

475
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:25,892
Karl, komm! Die polizei!

476
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,769
Karl, die polizei!

477
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,649
Well, it's about time.

478
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,866
No signs of disturbance, Dispatch.

479
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:24,826
Roger. Possible crank call.

480
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,619
Check the area again and confirm.

481
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,295
Who's driving this car,
Stevie Wonder?

482
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:39,549
I do see a guard inside.

483
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:41,926
I'm gonna go in for a closer look.

484
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:43,386
use caution.

485
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,640
Eddie?

486
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,268
I had a feelin' you'd be calling.

487
00:54:13,918 --> 00:54:16,669
Evenin', officer.
What can I do for you?

488
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:29,849
We had that false alarm.

489
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,935
You ask me, that goddamn
computer sent you

490
00:54:32,019 --> 00:54:34,145
on another wild-goose chase.

491
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:37,690
They been chasing bugs in this system
ever since they installed it.

492
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:40,109
...Notre Dame on top of uSC.

493
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,945
Aw, shit!

494
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:44,614
I got 50 bucks bet on them assholes.

495
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:50,453
Come on, come on,
where's the fucking cavalry?

496
00:55:14,395 --> 00:55:16,229
...was good for 52 yards.

497
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,356
Mind if I look around?

498
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,732
Help yourself.

499
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:22,235
27 seconds left in this first period.
Seven to nothing, Notre Dame.

500
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,321
The Irish driving 74 yards
in eight plays...

501
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:29,659
I'll put this fuckin'...

502
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,494
Freeze, motherfucker! Drop it!

503
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,912
Don't shoot!

504
00:55:32,997 --> 00:55:35,581
- Put the gun down!
- OK! Don't shoot!

505
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:36,749
Drop that fuckin' gun!

506
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:38,126
Marco, down!

507
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,020
Ah, to hell with this!

508
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,780
You are done!

509
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:10,992
No more table!
Where are you going, pal?

510
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:13,911
Next time you have a chance
to kill someone,

511
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,621
don't hesitate.

512
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:24,922
Thanks for the advice.

513
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:28,426
- Sorry to waste your time.
- No problem at all.

514
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,137
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

515
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,480
Oh, the weather outside is frightful

516
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:43,149
Dum de dum delightful

517
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,403
Oh, for the love...

518
00:56:50,991 --> 00:56:52,575
8-Lincoln-30 to Dispatch.

519
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:53,743
Go ahead.

520
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,245
A wild-goose chase
over here at Nakatomi Plaza.

521
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,331
Everything here's OK. Over.

522
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,085
But nobody has no place to go

523
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:06,089
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

524
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:08,341
Shit!

525
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,510
Goddamn it! Jesus H Christ!

526
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,019
Welcome to the party, pal!

527
00:57:20,104 --> 00:57:21,270
Goddamn it!

528
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:30,279
Get someone here now, goddamn it!

529
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:33,074
Policeman under automatic
rifle fire at Nakatomi!

530
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,201
I need backup assistance now!

531
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:37,662
Now, goddamn it! Now!

532
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,307
Monica, I can get us a table.

533
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:01,727
Wolfgang and I
are very close friends.

534
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,604
I interviewed him, for God's sake.

535
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,439
...Nakatomi.

536
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:08,484
Repeat.
Officer needs assistance at...

537
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:09,861
I'm at Nakatomi Plaza.

538
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,988
They're turning my car
into Swiss cheese!

539
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:14,198
I need backup assistance now!

540
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:16,325
Now, goddamn it! Now!

541
00:58:37,306 --> 00:58:39,056
Never thought
I'd love to hear that sound.

542
00:58:39,558 --> 00:58:40,766
All of you relax.

543
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:43,936
This is a matter
of inconvenient timing, that's all.

544
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:45,688
Police action was inevitable

545
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:48,774
and, as it happens, necessary.

546
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:52,361
So, let them fumble about outside
and stay calm.

547
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,530
This is simply the beginning.

548
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:58,701
I told you all I wanted
radio silence until...

549
00:58:58,827 --> 00:59:02,121
I'm very sorry, Hans.
I didn't get that message.

550
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,790
Maybe you should have put it
on the bulletin board.

551
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:07,793
I figured since I waxed Tony
and Marco and his friend here,

552
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:10,671
I figured you and Karl
and Franco might be lonely

553
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:12,506
so I wanted to give you a call.

554
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:15,218
How does he know
so much about us?

555
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,930
That's very kind of you.

556
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,391
I assume you are
our mysterious party crasher.

557
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:24,310
You are most troublesome

558
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,229
for a security guard.

559
00:59:26,647 --> 00:59:29,607
Eeeh! Sorry, Hans. Wrong guess.

560
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:32,860
would you like to go for double jeopardy
where the scores can really change?

561
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,825
Mm, these are very bad for you.

562
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,203
Who are you, then?

563
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:44,747
Just the fly in the ointment, Hans.

564
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:46,332
The monkey in the wrench,

565
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,376
the pain in the ass.

566
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:51,754
Whoa!

567
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,675
Check on all the others.
Don't use the radio.

568
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,009
See if he's lying about Marco

569
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:59,804
and find out
if anyone else is missing.

570
01:00:03,767 --> 01:00:05,851
Mr Mystery Guest,

571
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,521
are you still there?

572
01:00:09,273 --> 01:00:10,856
Yeah, I'm still here

573
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,693
unless you want to open
the front door for me.

574
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:15,695
No, I'm afraid not

575
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:18,698
but you have me at a loss.

576
01:00:18,782 --> 01:00:20,324
You know my name, but who are you?

577
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:24,704
Just another American
who saw too many movies as a child?

578
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:27,707
Another orphan
of a bankrupt culture

579
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:31,627
who thinks he's John wayne,
Rambo, Marshal Dillon?

580
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:35,298
I was always partial
to Roy Rogers, actually.

581
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:37,758
I liked those sequined shirts.

582
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:40,970
Do you really think you have
a chance against us, Mr Cowboy?

583
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:46,309
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

584
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,231
I'll beat everyone if I get a remote.

585
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:54,066
Sam, I don't have the new pages.

586
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:56,360
Harvey, keep your pants on.

587
01:00:56,737 --> 01:00:58,237
Sam, I'm begging you.

588
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:01,532
Simon's with the remote.
I'll tell him to swing by.

589
01:01:01,658 --> 01:01:03,492
I won't sit on this!

590
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:05,953
This is my story!
I'm going out there!

591
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:07,955
Look, Sam. Tell you what.

592
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,374
You don't give me a truck,
I'll steal a truck.

593
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:12,001
Give us a break, Thornburg.

594
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:13,127
Eat it, Harvey!

595
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:15,755
...four, three, two,

596
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,006
one.

597
01:01:17,466 --> 01:01:19,425
Harvey, we're on the air.

598
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:25,556
Good evening.
This is Harvey Johnson.

599
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:28,934
And I'm Gail Wallens.

600
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:31,020
This is Nightline News at 10.00.

601
01:01:31,146 --> 01:01:33,939
Our top stories
on this Christmas Eve...

602
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:37,193
Take truck number five.
Get out of here.

603
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:48,329
He wasn't lying about Marco.
He's down on the street.

604
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:50,331
The other man was Heinrich

605
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,666
and his bag is missing.

606
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:56,712
He had the detonator.

607
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:04,011
Theo.

608
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:05,221
Yo!

609
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:08,891
we may have some problems.
How's our schedule?

610
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,310
Three down, four to go.

611
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:12,520
Then don't waste time

612
01:02:12,604 --> 01:02:14,480
talking to me.

613
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:15,898
This is Sergeant Al Powell

614
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:18,025
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

615
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,360
If the person who radioed for help

616
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,903
can hear me on this channel,

617
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:22,988
acknowledge this transmission.

618
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,323
I say again,

619
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:27,743
if the person who radioed
for help can hear me,

620
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:29,912
acknowledge this transmission!

621
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,211
I read you, pal.
You the guy in the car?

622
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,255
What's left of him.

623
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:41,006
Can you identify yourself?

624
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,925
Not now. Maybe later.

625
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,552
Listen fast. This is a party line.

626
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:46,637
The neighbors got itchy trigger fingers.

627
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:48,264
All right, here's the deal.

628
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:50,516
You got 30 or so hostages
on the 30th floor.

629
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:52,017
The leader's name is Hans.

630
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,602
We have to find him and shut him up.

631
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:54,770
He's telling them everything!

632
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:56,939
Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI.

633
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,691
He can waste
as much time as he likes

634
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:01,986
but we must find the bag, Fritz.

635
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:03,362
They have a freakin' arsenal here.

636
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:05,364
We must have the detonators.

637
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,408
They got missiles, automatic weapons,

638
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:10,119
and enough plastic explosives
to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.

639
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:13,372
They're down to nine now,
counting the skydiver you met.

640
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:14,832
These guys are mostly European

641
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,418
judging by their clothing labels and

642
01:03:24,468 --> 01:03:25,968
cigarettes.

643
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:28,762
They're well-financed and very slick.

644
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,389
How do you know that?

645
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:32,224
I've seen enough phony IDs in my time

646
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:36,145
to recognize the ones they got
must have cost a fortune.

647
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,816
Add all that up. I don't know
what the fuck it means

648
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,693
but you got
some bad-ass perpetrators

649
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,487
and they're here to stay.

650
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:47,573
I hear you, partner.

651
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:48,908
LA's finest are on it,

652
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:50,493
so light 'em if you got 'em.

653
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,204
Way ahead of you, partner.

654
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:56,081
So what do I call you?

655
01:03:58,001 --> 01:03:59,126
Call me...

656
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:02,087
Roy.

657
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:05,466
Listen up, Roy,
if you think of anything else,

658
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:07,259
don't be shy, OK?

659
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:10,387
In the meantime, find a safe place
and let us do our job.

660
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:13,015
They're all yours, Al.

661
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:32,451
Who's talking to 'em?

662
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:36,330
I am, sir.
Sergeant Powell. Al Powell.

663
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:38,582
Dwayne Robinson. What's the deal?

664
01:04:38,667 --> 01:04:40,584
What do these pricks want?

665
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:42,795
If you mean the terrorists,

666
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:45,130
we haven't heard a peep from them.

667
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:47,466
Who have you been talking to?

668
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:51,053
We don't know.
He won't give us his name.

669
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,973
But he appears to be
the one who phoned.

670
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:57,101
He's killed one terrorist for sure
and claims he capped off two others.

671
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:58,394
He claims?

672
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:00,646
Powell, has it occurred to you

673
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,524
he could be
one of the terrorists pulling your chain

674
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:05,192
or some nutcase in there?

675
01:05:05,277 --> 01:05:08,320
I don't think so.
In fact, I think he's a cop,

676
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:11,282
maybe not LAPD,
but he's definitely a badge.

677
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:14,577
- How do you know that?
- A hunch... things he said

678
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:17,037
like being able to spot a phony ID.

679
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:19,498
Jesus Christ, Powell!

680
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:22,334
He could be a fucking bartender
for all we know!

681
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:23,919
TV's here.

682
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:26,171
Oh, shit.

683
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:44,607
I have a request.

684
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:47,067
What idiot put you in charge?

685
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:48,402
You did

686
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:51,530
when you murdered my boss.

687
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:54,241
Now everybody's looking to me.

688
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:55,868
Personally, I'd pass on the job.

689
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,621
I don't enjoy being this close to you.

690
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,672
Go on.

691
01:06:09,591 --> 01:06:11,508
We have a pregnant woman.

692
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:13,969
Relax. She's not due
for a couple weeks

693
01:06:14,054 --> 01:06:17,014
but sitting on that rock
isn't doing her back any good.

694
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:20,476
So I'd like permission to move her
to an office with a sofa.

695
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:25,230
No, but I'll have a sofa
brought out. Good enough?

696
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:26,690
Good enough.

697
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:28,567
And unless you like it messy,

698
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:30,903
start bringing us
in groups to the bathroom.

699
01:06:33,156 --> 01:06:34,907
Yes. You're right.

700
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,659
It will be done.

701
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:39,161
Was there something else?

702
01:06:40,914 --> 01:06:42,498
No, thank you.

703
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:51,799
Mr Takagi
chose his people well, Mrs...?

704
01:06:52,676 --> 01:06:53,676
Gennero.

705
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:58,013
Ms Gennero.

706
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:03,268
we interrupt this programme
for a special news bulletin.

707
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:06,313
This is Richard Thornburg
live from Century City.

708
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:09,441
Tonight, Los Angeles has joined

709
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:12,611
the sad and worldwide
fraternity of cities

710
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:14,154
whose only membership requirement

711
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:17,324
is to suffer the anguish
of international terrorism.

712
01:07:17,826 --> 01:07:22,121
Approximately two hours ago,
an unidentified group of men

713
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:24,707
seized control
of the Nakatomi building,

714
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:27,167
sealing off all entrances and exits.

715
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:29,420
All telephone lines have been cut

716
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:31,964
and the only communication
now possible

717
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,800
has been through the use
of CB communicators

718
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:37,219
which the group
apparently brought with them.

719
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:39,138
According to official sources,

720
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,640
the perpetrators of this building siege...

721
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:44,476
Unit five,
hold your position in the main entrance.

722
01:07:44,853 --> 01:07:47,020
We got Charlie unit in position

723
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:48,981
by the parking structure.

724
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,315
Let me ask you something.

725
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,818
Does this stairway
go up to the escalator?

726
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:53,902
Yeah.

727
01:07:54,195 --> 01:07:55,988
Tell them to go ahead.

728
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,574
What's going on?

729
01:07:59,367 --> 01:08:01,243
What's it look like? We're going in.

730
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,954
Going in? Man, that's crazy!

731
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:06,457
There could be over 30 hostages
in there for all we know.

732
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:08,250
We don't know shit, Powell.

733
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:11,920
If there's hostages, how come
there were no ransom demands?

734
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:15,507
If there's terrorists in there,
where's their list of demands?

735
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:17,593
All we know is that
somebody shot your car up.

736
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:19,762
It's probably the same silly son of a bitch

737
01:08:19,888 --> 01:08:21,764
you've been talking to on that radio.

738
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,515
Excuse me, sir,

739
01:08:24,184 --> 01:08:27,019
but what about the body
that fell out the window?

740
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,021
Probably some stockbroker
got depressed.

741
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,147
We're ready, Chief.

742
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:32,608
- Light 'em up. Let's go.
- Hit your lights.

743
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:35,611
- Blue units, go.
- Lights on!

744
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,707
Powell?

745
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,212
Powell, you still with me, babe?
What's going on?

746
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:54,630
Yo, Al.

747
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:57,216
I'm here, Roy,
but I'm kind of busy right now.

748
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:58,467
I'll talk to you later.

749
01:08:58,551 --> 01:08:59,551
Al, what's wrong?

750
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,470
I'll talk to you later.

751
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,180
If you are what I think you are,

752
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:05,808
you'll know when to listen,
shut up, and

753
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:09,478
and when to pray.

754
01:09:09,729 --> 01:09:11,772
Jesus Christ!
You're coming in, right?

755
01:09:12,524 --> 01:09:13,524
Christ, Powell,

756
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,484
I told you what kind of people
you're dealing with here.

757
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,569
Let's load them up.

758
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:24,326
They'll be coming.
Everyone get ready.

759
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:27,162
Theo, you are the eyes now.

760
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:40,926
- Rivers.
- Yo.

761
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,804
Begin your reconnoiter.

762
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,681
Let's go.

763
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,185
Shit!

764
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:11,790
Come on. Let's go.

765
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:23,510
Ow! Jesus!

766
01:10:57,587 --> 01:10:59,421
All right, spread out.

767
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,407
Shut up.

768
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:30,452
Let's go.

769
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,668
You macho assholes. No! No!

770
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:43,632
Ahem... all right. Listen up, guys.

771
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,678
'Twas the night before Christmas

772
01:11:47,762 --> 01:11:49,137
and all through the house

773
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:51,932
not a creature was stirring, except

774
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,726
the four assholes
coming in the rear in standard

775
01:11:54,811 --> 01:11:56,603
two-by-two cover formation.

776
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,315
We're all set.

777
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:02,818
We're ready.

778
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:05,070
Kick ass.

779
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,405
Go!

780
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:08,657
Right. Let's do it.

781
01:12:24,007 --> 01:12:25,424
Take cover!

782
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:27,342
They're shooting at 'em.

783
01:12:27,427 --> 01:12:29,594
It's panic fire.
They can't see anything.

784
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:31,596
They're shooting at the lights.

785
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:39,521
They're going after the lights.
Call them back.

786
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:41,606
It's not happening.

787
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,191
Mike, burn it.

788
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,862
Don't be impatient.

789
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,531
Just wound them.

790
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:53,910
Get them back.
They're sitting ducks without lights.

791
01:12:54,162 --> 01:12:55,954
They're almost in.

792
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:58,498
Send in the car.

793
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,805
Jesus Christ!

794
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:19,478
Rivers, Rodriguez, report.

795
01:13:19,562 --> 01:13:22,522
Wait a minute.
What have we here, gentlemen?

796
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:29,196
The police have themselves an RV.

797
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:35,869
Southeast corner.

798
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:50,842
Oh, Jesus Christ.

799
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:05,899
Get back! Get the fuck back!

800
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:08,360
Get over there.

801
01:14:08,444 --> 01:14:09,861
Schnell! Schnell!

802
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:12,114
Mach schnell!

803
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:16,409
Weiter! Weiter! Weiter!

804
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:18,537
Mach schnell! Mach schnell!

805
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:19,788
Weiter!

806
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:24,793
Mach los! Mach los!

807
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:45,564
I see him!

808
01:14:57,285 --> 01:14:58,952
- Fire!
- Clear!

809
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:07,711
Oh, my God!
The quarterback is toast!

810
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:12,132
Hang on, Rivers. That's an order.

811
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,300
Hit it again.

812
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:15,427
All right, you motherfucker,
you made your point!

813
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:16,636
Let them pull back!

814
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:18,263
Thank you, Mr Cowboy.
I'll take it under advisement.

815
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,347
Hit it

816
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:20,682
again.

817
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:36,323
Fire.

818
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,380
Fuck me.

819
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:55,467
Get them out of the car! They're burning!

820
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:06,895
Fuck it.

821
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:10,899
Mach schnell! Mach los!

822
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:22,410
Let's see you take this
under advisement, jerkweed.

823
01:16:26,082 --> 01:16:28,083
Geronimo, motherfucker.

824
01:16:46,602 --> 01:16:48,061
Oh, shit!

825
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:54,693
They're using artillery on us!

826
01:16:54,777 --> 01:16:57,070
You idiot, it's not the police.

827
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,072
It's him.

828
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:07,956
Holy shit.

829
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:14,296
My God!

830
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:19,884
- Tell me you got that.
- I got it.

831
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:23,513
Eat your heart out, Channel Five.

832
01:17:24,348 --> 01:17:25,348
we've had an update

833
01:17:25,433 --> 01:17:27,726
on the terrorist takeover
of the Nakatomi building.

834
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,978
Sources say
the terrorist leader, Hans,

835
01:17:30,104 --> 01:17:31,938
may be this man... Hans Gruber.

836
01:17:32,023 --> 01:17:35,150
A member of the radical
West German Volksfrei movement.

837
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:39,029
Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership
issued a communiqué an hour ago

838
01:17:39,113 --> 01:17:41,906
stating that Gruber had been
expelled from that organization.

839
01:17:42,283 --> 01:17:44,367
Al, do you copy?

840
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:46,119
Are you all right?

841
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,330
Yeah, I'm fine.

842
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,082
W-what was that?

843
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:53,626
Remember that plastic
explosive I told you about?

844
01:17:54,045 --> 01:17:56,838
There you go.
Is the building on fire?

845
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,506
No, but it's gonna need a paint job

846
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,467
and a shitload of screen doors.

847
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:02,802
Our spotter said you got two
with that blast.

848
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:05,889
- Is that him?
- Yes, sir.

849
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:10,477
I don't know who you think you are

850
01:18:10,561 --> 01:18:12,479
but you just destroyed a building.

851
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:15,690
we do not want your help.
Is that clear?

852
01:18:15,775 --> 01:18:17,609
we don't want your help.

853
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,779
I've got 100 people down here,
and they're covered with glass.

854
01:18:20,863 --> 01:18:23,782
Glass? Who gives a shit about glass?

855
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:24,866
Who the fuck is this?

856
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:28,912
This is Deputy Chief of Police
Dwayne T Robinson

857
01:18:28,996 --> 01:18:31,289
and I am in charge of this situation.

858
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:33,041
Oh, you're in charge?

859
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:35,126
I got some bad news for you, Dwayne.

860
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:38,254
from up here it doesn't look
like you're in charge of shit.

861
01:18:38,422 --> 01:18:40,382
Listen to me, you little asshole...

862
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:41,549
Asshole?

863
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,468
I'm not the one
who just got buttfucked

864
01:18:43,552 --> 01:18:45,387
on national TV, Dwayne.

865
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:46,721
Ah ha ha!

866
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:48,098
Listen to me, jerk-off,

867
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:49,891
if you're not part of the solution,
you're part of the problem.

868
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:53,770
Quit being part of the problem
and put the other guy back on!

869
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,484
Hey, Roy, how you feeling?

870
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,569
Pretty fucking unappreciated, Al.

871
01:19:02,029 --> 01:19:03,905
Hey, look. I love you.

872
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,282
So do a lot of the other guys.

873
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:08,952
So hang in there, man, you hear me?

874
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:10,912
You hang in there.

875
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,874
Yeah, thanks, partner.

876
01:19:20,923 --> 01:19:22,257
What are you doing?

877
01:19:22,383 --> 01:19:23,591
I'm tired of sitting here

878
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:25,927
waiting to see
who gets us killed first,

879
01:19:26,011 --> 01:19:27,762
them or your husband.

880
01:19:27,847 --> 01:19:29,305
What are you going to do?

881
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:30,348
Hey, babe,

882
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:32,100
I negotiate million-dollar deals
for breakfast.

883
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:34,727
I think I can handle this Eurotrash.

884
01:19:34,854 --> 01:19:37,730
Hey, sprechen sie talk, huh?

885
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,608
If you'd listened to me,
he would be neutralized already.

886
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:43,111
I don't want neutral. I want dead.

887
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:45,989
Hope I'm not interrupting.

888
01:19:46,073 --> 01:19:47,615
What does he want?

889
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,785
It's not what I want.
It's what I can give you.

890
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:00,628
Look, let's be straight, OK?

891
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:03,214
It's obvious you're not
some dumb schmuck

892
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:05,300
up here to snatch a few purses.

893
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,385
You're very perceptive.

894
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:08,803
I watch 60 Minutes.

895
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:11,556
I say to myself,
these guys are professional,

896
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:14,058
they're motivated, they're happening,

897
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:15,768
they want something.

898
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:18,688
I couldn't care less
about your politics.

899
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:20,732
Maybe you're pissed off
at the camel jockeys.

900
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,150
Maybe it's the Hebes,
Northern Ireland.

901
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:23,735
It's none of my business.

902
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:26,571
I figure you're here
to negotiate, am I right?

903
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:27,655
You're amazing.

904
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:30,033
You figured this all out already?

905
01:20:30,117 --> 01:20:32,243
Hey, business is business.

906
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:34,245
You use a gun,
I use a fountain pen.

907
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:35,580
What's the difference?

908
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:36,748
Let's put it in my terms.

909
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,166
You're here on a hostile takeover.

910
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:39,542
You grab us for some green

911
01:20:39,627 --> 01:20:42,921
but you didn't expect some poison pill
was gonna be running around the building.

912
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:44,339
Am I right?

913
01:20:44,465 --> 01:20:45,673
Hans,

914
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,383
bubbie...

915
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,552
I'm your white knight.

916
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:53,139
I must have missed 60 Minutes.

917
01:20:53,224 --> 01:20:55,016
What are you saying?

918
01:20:56,769 --> 01:20:59,979
The guy upstairs
who's fucking things up, huh?

919
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,319
I can give him to you.

920
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:11,115
Oh, God...

921
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:15,537
Roy? Roy, you all right?

922
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:20,041
Just trying to fire down
a 1,000-year-old Twinkie.

923
01:21:21,293 --> 01:21:22,293
What do they put in these things,

924
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:23,419
anyway?

925
01:21:23,796 --> 01:21:25,547
Sugar, enriched flour,

926
01:21:25,673 --> 01:21:27,715
partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil,

927
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,217
polysorbate 60,

928
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:31,010
and yellow dye number five.

929
01:21:31,554 --> 01:21:34,013
Just everything
a growing boy needs.

930
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,474
How many kids you got, Al?

931
01:21:36,559 --> 01:21:39,936
As a matter of fact,
my wife is working on our first.

932
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,355
How about you, cowboy?

933
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:44,857
You got any kids
back on your ranch?

934
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:47,569
Yeah.

935
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:48,987
Two.

936
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,030
Sure hope I can see them

937
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:53,408
swinging on a jungle gym
with Al Jnr someday.

938
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:57,829
Well, now, that's a date

939
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,039
but you bring the ice cream.

940
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:02,750
Touching, cowboy. Touching.

941
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:04,919
Or should I call you

942
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:07,714
Mr McClane?

943
01:22:08,507 --> 01:22:11,175
Mr Officer John McClane

944
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,928
of the New York
Police Department?

945
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:17,765
Get on the phone to Harry in New York.

946
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,059
You better get a hold of somebody
at Dispatch.

947
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:24,272
Sister Theresa called me
Mr McClane in the third grade.

948
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,816
My friends call me John

949
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:29,152
and you're neither, shithead.

950
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:33,489
I have someone
who wants to talk to you.

951
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:35,783
A very special friend

952
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:38,453
who was with you
at the party tonight.

953
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:46,544
Hey, John boy.

954
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,297
Ellis?

955
01:22:49,548 --> 01:22:50,882
Yeah.

956
01:22:50,966 --> 01:22:54,927
Listen, John, they're giving me
a few minutes to talk sense into you.

957
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:58,056
I know you think you're doing your job
and I can appreciate that

958
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,849
but you're just dragging
this thing out.

959
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:02,977
Look, no-one gets out of here
until these guys

960
01:23:03,062 --> 01:23:04,729
can talk to the LA Police.

961
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:08,232
That won't happen until you stop
messing up the works. Capisce?

962
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:15,490
Ellis, what have you told them?

963
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:19,577
I told them we were old friends
and you were my guest

964
01:23:19,662 --> 01:23:21,162
at the party.

965
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:24,248
Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.

966
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:26,125
Tell me about it.

967
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:33,841
All right, John, listen.

968
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:37,387
They want you to tell them
where the detonators are.

969
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:39,555
They know people are listening.

970
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:43,476
They want the detonators,
or they're gonna kill me.

971
01:23:47,147 --> 01:23:48,481
John, didn't you hear me?

972
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:52,735
Yeah, I hear you.

973
01:23:53,153 --> 01:23:55,154
John, get with the programme.

974
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:57,407
The police are here now.
It's their problem.

975
01:23:57,491 --> 01:24:00,034
Tell these guys where the detonators are
so no-one else gets hurt!

976
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:03,204
I'm putting my life
on the line for you, pal!

977
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:04,831
Ellis, listen to me carefully.

978
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:05,957
John...

979
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,751
Shut up, Ellis!
Just shut your mouth!

980
01:24:08,836 --> 01:24:10,211
Put Hans back on the line.

981
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:14,924
Hans, this shithead doesn't know
what kind of man you are but I do.

982
01:24:15,008 --> 01:24:16,968
Good. Then you'll
give us what we want

983
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,219
and save your friend's life.

984
01:24:18,303 --> 01:24:20,722
You're not part of this equation.

985
01:24:20,848 --> 01:24:23,141
Hey, what am I, a method actor?

986
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:24,809
Babe, put away the gun.

987
01:24:24,893 --> 01:24:26,644
this is radio, not television.

988
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:28,646
Hans, this asshole is not my friend!

989
01:24:28,731 --> 01:24:30,273
I just met him tonight!
I don't know him!

990
01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:32,400
Jesus Christ, Ellis!
These people will kill you!

991
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:34,360
Tell them you don't know me!

992
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:37,905
How can you say that
after all these years?

993
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:41,909
John? John?

994
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:06,392
Do you hear that?

995
01:25:07,019 --> 01:25:09,437
Talk to me!
Where are my detonators?

996
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:12,565
Where are they,
or shall I shoot another one?

997
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:13,900
Sooner or later

998
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:16,444
I might get to someone
you do care about.

999
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,739
Go fuck yourself, Hans.

1000
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:22,784
He just let the guy die.

1001
01:25:22,868 --> 01:25:25,369
He just gave him up.
Give me that headset.

1002
01:25:25,454 --> 01:25:27,330
That's like pulling the trigger yourself.

1003
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:31,334
Can't you see what's happening?
Can't you read between the lines?

1004
01:25:31,418 --> 01:25:34,003
He did everything he could
to save him.

1005
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:36,672
If he gave himself up,
they'd both be dead right now!

1006
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:39,175
No way, man. They'd be talking to us.

1007
01:25:39,259 --> 01:25:42,762
You tell this partner of yours
to stay out of this from now on.

1008
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:46,516
Because if he doesn't,
I'm really going to nail his ass.

1009
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,184
The man is hurting.

1010
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:50,061
He is alone, tired,

1011
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:53,648
and he hasn't seen diddly-squat
from anybody here!

1012
01:25:53,732 --> 01:25:56,234
You're gonna tell me he'll give a damn

1013
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:59,695
about what you do to him
if he makes it out of there alive?

1014
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:02,281
Why don't you wake up
and smell what you're shoveling?

1015
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:04,158
You listen to me, sergeant.

1016
01:26:04,243 --> 01:26:07,745
Any time you want to go home,
you consider yourself dismissed.

1017
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:11,082
No, sir.
You couldn't drag me away.

1018
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:16,337
Attention, police.

1019
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:19,507
- This is Sergeant Al Powell...
- Give me that.

1020
01:26:19,842 --> 01:26:22,093
This is Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson.

1021
01:26:22,177 --> 01:26:23,177
Who is this?

1022
01:26:23,345 --> 01:26:25,137
This is Hans Gruber.

1023
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:29,267
I assume you realize the futility
of direct action against me.

1024
01:26:29,351 --> 01:26:31,519
We have no wish
for further loss of life.

1025
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:34,689
What is it you do wish for?

1026
01:26:35,107 --> 01:26:39,026
I have comrades in arms
around the world languishing in prison.

1027
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:42,572
The American State Department
enjoys rattling its saber for its own ends.

1028
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:44,699
Now it can rattle it for me.

1029
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:49,996
The following people
are to be released from their captors.

1030
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:53,708
In Northern Ireland the seven members
of the New Provo Front.

1031
01:26:54,293 --> 01:26:58,462
In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders
of Liberté de Quebec.

1032
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:02,466
In Sri Lanka, the nine members
of the Asian Dawn.

1033
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:04,051
What the fuck?

1034
01:27:04,428 --> 01:27:06,012
Asian Dawn?

1035
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:09,056
I read about them in Time magazine.

1036
01:27:09,433 --> 01:27:12,894
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free,

1037
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:16,105
the hostages in this building
will be taken to the roof

1038
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:18,149
and they will accompany us
in helicopters

1039
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,651
to the Los Angeles
International Airport

1040
01:27:20,736 --> 01:27:22,737
where they will be given
further instructions.

1041
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:25,114
You have two hours to comply.

1042
01:27:26,033 --> 01:27:28,826
Wait a minute. Uh, Mr. Gruber.
This is crazy.

1043
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:32,663
I don't have the authority.
Two hours is not enough.

1044
01:27:32,748 --> 01:27:35,166
Hello? Hello!

1045
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:40,338
Did you get all that?
We got to make some calls.

1046
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:42,548
Do you think they'll even try?

1047
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:44,800
Who cares?

1048
01:27:47,471 --> 01:27:49,138
Theo, are we on schedule?

1049
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:51,265
One more to go, then it's up to you.

1050
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:54,769
You better be right
because the last one will take a miracle.

1051
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,354
It's Christmas, Theo.

1052
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:59,023
It's the time of miracles,
so be of good cheer

1053
01:27:59,107 --> 01:28:01,901
and call me
when you hit the last lock.

1054
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:03,653
Karl,

1055
01:28:03,737 --> 01:28:07,406
hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.

1056
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:09,617
Fritz is checking the explosives.

1057
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:12,370
I'll check the explosives.
You just get the detonators.

1058
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:14,789
Hey, Powell, you out there?

1059
01:28:16,166 --> 01:28:18,000
I'm here, John. I'm here.

1060
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:21,587
You gotta believe me.
There was nothing I could do.

1061
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:25,591
Well, it's gonna be
both our asses if you're wrong.

1062
01:28:25,968 --> 01:28:27,510
I hear you.

1063
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:35,643
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?

1064
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:39,063
It doesn't make sense, man.

1065
01:28:39,523 --> 01:28:40,523
Hey, don't ask me, man.

1066
01:28:40,607 --> 01:28:43,609
I'm just a desk jockey
who was on my way home when you rang.

1067
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:47,238
The way you drove that car
I figured you for the street, Al.

1068
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:50,116
In my youth. In my youth.

1069
01:28:50,450 --> 01:28:54,412
...author of "Hostage Terrorist,
Terrorist Hostage,

1070
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:56,080
A Study in Duality."

1071
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:57,206
Dr Hasseldorf,

1072
01:28:57,290 --> 01:28:59,000
what can we expect
in the next few hours?

1073
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:00,126
Well, Gail,

1074
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:02,753
by this time,
the hostages should be going through

1075
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:05,172
the early stages
of the Helsinki Syndrome.

1076
01:29:05,257 --> 01:29:07,091
As in Helsinki, Sweden.

1077
01:29:08,093 --> 01:29:09,093
Finland.

1078
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:12,430
Basically, it's when the hostages
and the terrorists

1079
01:29:12,514 --> 01:29:15,182
go through a sort of
psychological transference

1080
01:29:15,267 --> 01:29:17,351
and a projection of dependency.

1081
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:20,312
A strange sort of trust
and bond develops.

1082
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:22,857
We've had situations
where the hostages

1083
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:25,276
have embraced their captors
after release

1084
01:29:25,485 --> 01:29:27,486
and even corresponded with them
in prison.

1085
01:29:28,030 --> 01:29:30,823
No, no, darling. Asian Dawn. Dawn.

1086
01:29:31,491 --> 01:29:33,868
D-A-W-N.

1087
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,369
- Sir?
- Yeah?

1088
01:29:35,495 --> 01:29:37,371
Sir, the FBI is here.

1089
01:29:37,497 --> 01:29:40,708
- The FBI is here now?
- Yes, sir. Right over there.

1090
01:29:40,917 --> 01:29:42,043
Hold this.

1091
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:44,545
Want a breath mint?

1092
01:29:49,051 --> 01:29:51,552
Hey, how you doing, man?

1093
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:54,138
I'm Agent Johnson.
This is Special Agent Johnson.

1094
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:56,682
- Oh, how you doing?
- No relation.

1095
01:29:57,476 --> 01:29:58,809
I'm, uh...

1096
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:03,397
I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.
I'm in charge here.

1097
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:05,941
Not any more.

1098
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:04,375
Hi, there. How you doing?

1099
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:09,046
Ohh...

1100
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:13,634
Please, God. No.
You're one of them, aren't you?

1101
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:15,427
You're one of them.

1102
01:31:15,512 --> 01:31:18,389
No! Don't kill me! Please!

1103
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:20,724
Don't kill me, please!
Please, please, please.

1104
01:31:20,809 --> 01:31:23,853
Whoa. Relax.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1105
01:31:23,937 --> 01:31:25,813
I'm not gonna hurt you!

1106
01:31:28,108 --> 01:31:29,733
Oh, God.

1107
01:31:33,155 --> 01:31:34,905
What the fuck
are you doing up here?

1108
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:36,407
What were you looking for?

1109
01:31:36,491 --> 01:31:38,909
I managed to get out of there and

1110
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:42,079
I was just trying
to get up on the roof

1111
01:31:42,164 --> 01:31:44,915
and see if I could signal for help.

1112
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:48,711
It's just over here.
Why don't you come and help?

1113
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:51,922
Hold it. Forget the roof.

1114
01:31:52,465 --> 01:31:55,718
I said forget the roof.
They got people all over it.

1115
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:59,346
You want to stay alive,
you stay with me.

1116
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:04,059
The best we can figure it,

1117
01:32:04,144 --> 01:32:07,605
we've got maybe
30 or 35 hostages up there

1118
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:09,356
probably on the 30th floor

1119
01:32:09,441 --> 01:32:13,068
and maybe seven or eight
terrorists up there.

1120
01:32:13,445 --> 01:32:15,613
Sounds like an A-7 scenario.

1121
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:17,740
Thank you.
We'll handle it from here.

1122
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:21,035
When we commandeer your men,
we'll try and let you know.

1123
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:23,037
Aren't you forgetting something?

1124
01:32:23,163 --> 01:32:24,121
Such as?

1125
01:32:24,206 --> 01:32:26,123
What about John McClane?

1126
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:29,126
He's the reason
we have any information.

1127
01:32:29,669 --> 01:32:33,297
He's also the reason
you're facing seven terrorists, not twelve.

1128
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:35,257
He's inside? Who is he?

1129
01:32:35,342 --> 01:32:38,219
He might be a cop.
We're checking on that.

1130
01:32:38,345 --> 01:32:40,846
- One of yours?
- No, no way.

1131
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:47,895
You smoke?

1132
01:32:48,813 --> 01:32:49,980
Yeah.

1133
01:32:55,195 --> 01:32:56,403
Thanks.

1134
01:33:00,951 --> 01:33:03,118
You don't work for Nakatomi.

1135
01:33:07,249 --> 01:33:09,583
And if you're not one of them...

1136
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,338
I'm a cop from New York.

1137
01:33:15,757 --> 01:33:17,341
New York?

1138
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:18,634
Yeah.

1139
01:33:19,427 --> 01:33:22,263
Got invited to
the Christmas party by mistake.

1140
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:23,931
Who knew?

1141
01:33:32,190 --> 01:33:35,401
Better than being caught
with your pants down, huh?

1142
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,244
I'm John McClane.

1143
01:33:46,413 --> 01:33:47,913
You're, uh...

1144
01:33:49,291 --> 01:33:50,416
Clay.

1145
01:33:52,919 --> 01:33:54,253
Bill Clay.

1146
01:34:00,385 --> 01:34:02,636
Know how to use a handgun, Bill?

1147
01:34:03,763 --> 01:34:05,889
I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.

1148
01:34:05,974 --> 01:34:08,225
That game with the guns
that shoot red paint.

1149
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:10,811
Probably seems kind of stupid to you.

1150
01:34:12,272 --> 01:34:13,480
Nope.

1151
01:34:16,276 --> 01:34:18,485
Time for the real thing, Bill.

1152
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:29,163
All you got to do
is pull the trigger.

1153
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:30,831
Come on.

1154
01:34:49,642 --> 01:34:51,143
Put down the gun

1155
01:34:51,686 --> 01:34:53,854
and give me my detonators.

1156
01:34:58,443 --> 01:34:59,860
Well, well, well...

1157
01:35:01,696 --> 01:35:02,780
Hans.

1158
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:06,367
Put it down now.

1159
01:35:09,954 --> 01:35:12,623
That's pretty tricky
with that accent.

1160
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:16,543
You oughta be on fucking TV
with that accent.

1161
01:35:19,047 --> 01:35:21,882
But what do you want
with the detonators?

1162
01:35:22,884 --> 01:35:25,552
I already used all the explosives.

1163
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:29,056
Or did I?

1164
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:32,142
I'm going to count to three.

1165
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:34,686
Yeah. Like you did with Takagi?

1166
01:35:35,814 --> 01:35:36,897
Oops.

1167
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:39,733
No bullets.

1168
01:35:39,818 --> 01:35:41,568
What do you think...
I'm fucking stupid, Hans?

1169
01:35:42,737 --> 01:35:43,737
You were saying?

1170
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:39,835
Karl.

1171
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:42,045
Schieß dem Fenster.

1172
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:51,138
Shoot the glass!

1173
01:37:24,297 --> 01:37:25,797
Jesus Christ!

1174
01:37:55,036 --> 01:37:57,996
Smile, Karl.
We're back in business.

1175
01:38:00,667 --> 01:38:03,627
...is the last resort of diplomacy,

1176
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:06,797
then couldn't we just as well say

1177
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:10,050
that terrorism has an equal claim
on being that, too?

1178
01:38:10,510 --> 01:38:12,636
Tell me you got something.

1179
01:38:12,845 --> 01:38:16,390
McClane's name, badge number,
employment record, vital statistics,

1180
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:18,600
and his family's home address

1181
01:38:18,685 --> 01:38:20,644
right here in LA.

1182
01:38:22,564 --> 01:38:23,605
Whoo!

1183
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:29,820
Go to work.

1184
01:38:30,363 --> 01:38:31,697
Got it.

1185
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:47,546
God, that man looks really pissed.

1186
01:38:49,882 --> 01:38:51,466
He's still alive.

1187
01:38:52,260 --> 01:38:53,260
What?

1188
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:57,556
Only John can drive
somebody that crazy.

1189
01:39:14,449 --> 01:39:16,575
Hans, you better heat up that miracle

1190
01:39:16,659 --> 01:39:18,702
because we just broke through
on number six

1191
01:39:18,786 --> 01:39:21,538
and the electromagnetic
came down like a fucking anvil.

1192
01:39:22,123 --> 01:39:26,501
Have a look at what our friends
outside are doing and I'll be right up.

1193
01:39:29,255 --> 01:39:30,422
Hey, John.

1194
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,841
John McClane, you still with us?

1195
01:39:32,925 --> 01:39:34,051
Yeah.

1196
01:39:35,053 --> 01:39:38,889
But all things being equal,
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

1197
01:39:39,474 --> 01:39:41,600
Chalk up two more bad guys.

1198
01:39:42,185 --> 01:39:44,978
The boys down here
will be glad to hear that.

1199
01:39:45,605 --> 01:39:47,856
we got a pool going on you.

1200
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:49,441
What kind of odds am I getting?

1201
01:39:49,776 --> 01:39:51,193
You don't want to know.

1202
01:39:51,277 --> 01:39:52,653
Put me down for 20.

1203
01:39:52,779 --> 01:39:54,321
I'm good for it.

1204
01:39:57,742 --> 01:40:00,410
Hey, pal, you got flat feet?

1205
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:05,248
What the hell
are you talking about, man?

1206
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,751
Something had
to get you off the street.

1207
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:08,835
What's the matter?

1208
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:12,339
You don't think jockeying papers
across a desk is a noble effort for a cop?

1209
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:15,842
No.

1210
01:40:19,222 --> 01:40:20,597
I had an accident.

1211
01:40:20,682 --> 01:40:22,974
The way you drive, I can see why.

1212
01:40:23,351 --> 01:40:24,434
what'd you do?

1213
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:26,728
Run over your captain's foot
with the car?

1214
01:40:30,817 --> 01:40:32,025
I shot a kid.

1215
01:40:33,611 --> 01:40:35,445
He was 13 years old.

1216
01:40:36,698 --> 01:40:38,699
Oh, it was dark. I couldn't see him.

1217
01:40:38,825 --> 01:40:40,701
He had a ray gun, looked real enough.

1218
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:47,207
When you're a rookie, they teach you
everything about being a cop

1219
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:49,167
except how to live with a mistake.

1220
01:40:53,715 --> 01:40:58,051
Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself
to draw my gun on anybody again.

1221
01:41:01,556 --> 01:41:02,889
Sorry, man.

1222
01:41:04,392 --> 01:41:07,060
Hey, man, how could you know?

1223
01:41:09,397 --> 01:41:11,231
I feel like shit anyway.

1224
01:41:14,235 --> 01:41:15,861
Well, then, this won't matter.

1225
01:41:16,738 --> 01:41:20,741
The LAPD is not calling the shots
down here any more.

1226
01:41:23,161 --> 01:41:24,327
The Feds?

1227
01:41:24,871 --> 01:41:25,912
You got it.

1228
01:41:27,749 --> 01:41:30,083
Those are the city engineers.

1229
01:41:31,127 --> 01:41:32,335
Wait.

1230
01:41:32,587 --> 01:41:34,504
They're going into the street circuits.

1231
01:41:35,423 --> 01:41:37,174
Those guys in the suits,
I don't know who they are.

1232
01:41:37,258 --> 01:41:38,467
That's the FBI.

1233
01:41:39,886 --> 01:41:43,138
They're ordering the others
to cut the building's power.

1234
01:41:43,222 --> 01:41:45,223
Regular as clockwork.

1235
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:48,435
Or a time lock.

1236
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:50,353
Precisely.

1237
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:54,775
The circuits that cannot be cut
are cut automatically

1238
01:41:54,901 --> 01:41:57,611
in response to a terrorist incident.

1239
01:41:57,737 --> 01:41:59,863
You asked for miracles, Theo.

1240
01:41:59,947 --> 01:42:03,784
I give you the F-B-I.

1241
01:42:04,202 --> 01:42:05,952
I want the building shut down.

1242
01:42:06,037 --> 01:42:08,079
I got a problem. I got a switch...

1243
01:42:08,164 --> 01:42:12,501
I don't care
about your switch. I want it out. Dark!

1244
01:42:13,419 --> 01:42:14,961
You can't do it from here.

1245
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:17,464
- Yeah, you could.
- It can't be done from here.

1246
01:42:17,548 --> 01:42:18,590
I could just... I got the radio...

1247
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:22,719
You can't do it from here.
It's got to be done from downtown.

1248
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:24,471
They've gotta take out
a whole city grid.

1249
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:26,431
We're talking 10 square blocks.

1250
01:42:26,516 --> 01:42:28,433
Ten blocks? Johnson, that's crazy.

1251
01:42:28,518 --> 01:42:30,894
It's Christmas Eve.
There's thousands of people.

1252
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:32,646
You have to go wider.

1253
01:42:32,939 --> 01:42:34,773
I need authorization.

1254
01:42:34,857 --> 01:42:37,609
How about the United States government?

1255
01:42:38,069 --> 01:42:40,153
Lose the grid, or you lose your job.

1256
01:42:46,577 --> 01:42:48,203
- Yeah, Central?
- Yeah?

1257
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:50,622
This is Walt down at Nakatomi.

1258
01:42:50,832 --> 01:42:55,752
Would it be possible for you
to turn off grid 212?

1259
01:42:55,837 --> 01:42:57,003
Are you crazy?

1260
01:42:57,088 --> 01:42:59,214
Maybe I should call the Mayor.

1261
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:01,716
No shit it's my ass.
I got a big problem here.

1262
01:43:01,801 --> 01:43:04,177
Shut it down now.

1263
01:43:08,683 --> 01:43:10,934
Emergency lighting activated.

1264
01:43:11,519 --> 01:43:14,354
Al, talk to me. What's going on here?

1265
01:43:14,438 --> 01:43:15,981
Ask the FBI.

1266
01:43:16,566 --> 01:43:18,775
They got the universal
terrorist playbook

1267
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:21,319
and they're running it step by step.

1268
01:43:23,447 --> 01:43:25,365
It's gonna go. It's gonna go!

1269
01:43:27,159 --> 01:43:28,535
Yes!

1270
01:43:51,392 --> 01:43:52,893
Merry Christmas.

1271
01:43:55,396 --> 01:43:57,606
They must be pissing in their pants.

1272
01:43:57,690 --> 01:43:59,566
The Mayor is gonna have my ass.

1273
01:44:06,574 --> 01:44:07,908
Whoo!

1274
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:23,715
What are we gonna do now?

1275
01:44:23,799 --> 01:44:26,468
Arrest them for not paying
their electric bill?

1276
01:44:26,552 --> 01:44:28,094
We've shut them down.

1277
01:44:28,179 --> 01:44:31,598
We let them sweat for a while,
then we give them helicopters.

1278
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:33,892
Right up the ass.

1279
01:44:36,437 --> 01:44:38,188
This is Agent Johnson.

1280
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:39,773
No, the other one.

1281
01:44:39,857 --> 01:44:42,859
I want that air support ready
to lift off in five minutes.

1282
01:44:42,944 --> 01:44:45,904
Damn right. Fully armed.
We're on the way.

1283
01:44:52,787 --> 01:44:54,746
Oh, yes!

1284
01:44:55,957 --> 01:44:58,375
I wish to talk to the FBI.

1285
01:45:00,962 --> 01:45:03,088
This is Special Agent Johnson.

1286
01:45:03,923 --> 01:45:07,217
The State Department has arranged
for the return of your comrades.

1287
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:10,303
Helicopters are en route
as you requested.

1288
01:45:10,429 --> 01:45:12,389
I hear you. we'll be ready.

1289
01:45:12,473 --> 01:45:15,600
By the time he figures out
what hit him, he'll be in a body bag.

1290
01:45:15,685 --> 01:45:17,227
When they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.

1291
01:45:17,311 --> 01:45:18,979
They'll spend a month
sifting through the rubble.

1292
01:45:19,063 --> 01:45:21,690
By the time they figure out
what went wrong,

1293
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:24,901
we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20%.

1294
01:45:30,116 --> 01:45:31,574
Ah! Jeez!

1295
01:45:31,659 --> 01:45:32,742
Powell?

1296
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:35,412
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

1297
01:45:37,164 --> 01:45:38,832
I'm here, John.

1298
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:43,628
Listen, I'm starting to get
a bad feeling up here.

1299
01:45:44,171 --> 01:45:46,172
I want you to do something for me.

1300
01:45:46,257 --> 01:45:47,507
Um... ahem...

1301
01:45:49,010 --> 01:45:50,135
I want you to find my wife.

1302
01:45:50,219 --> 01:45:52,929
Don't ask me how.
By then you'll know how.

1303
01:45:53,014 --> 01:45:56,433
Uh, I want you
to tell her something.

1304
01:45:57,852 --> 01:45:59,978
I want you to tell her that...

1305
01:46:06,652 --> 01:46:09,279
Tell her it took me
a while to figure out

1306
01:46:09,363 --> 01:46:11,364
what a jerk I've been

1307
01:46:12,033 --> 01:46:13,324
but, um...

1308
01:46:14,994 --> 01:46:15,994
that...

1309
01:46:19,874 --> 01:46:22,542
that when things started
to pan out for her

1310
01:46:22,668 --> 01:46:26,713
I should have been more supportive.

1311
01:46:26,881 --> 01:46:28,131
And, uh...

1312
01:46:29,383 --> 01:46:32,343
I just should have been
behind her more.

1313
01:46:35,222 --> 01:46:36,514
Oh, shit.

1314
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:41,311
Tell her that, um

1315
01:46:42,646 --> 01:46:46,566
that she's the best thing
that ever happened to a bum like me.

1316
01:46:48,694 --> 01:46:52,155
She's heard me say "I love you"
a thousand times.

1317
01:46:53,574 --> 01:46:56,993
She never heard me say I'm sorry.

1318
01:46:57,369 --> 01:47:03,583
I want you to tell her that, Al.
Tell her that John said that he was sorry.

1319
01:47:04,919 --> 01:47:06,002
OK?

1320
01:47:06,921 --> 01:47:08,088
You got that, man?

1321
01:47:08,964 --> 01:47:10,298
Yeah, I got it, John.

1322
01:47:11,759 --> 01:47:13,510
But you can tell her that yourself.

1323
01:47:14,512 --> 01:47:18,264
You just watch your ass
and you'll make it out. You hear me?

1324
01:47:18,766 --> 01:47:21,434
I guess that's up to the man upstairs.

1325
01:47:24,772 --> 01:47:28,274
John?

1326
01:47:28,901 --> 01:47:32,445
What the fuck
were you doing upstairs, Hans?

1327
01:47:34,073 --> 01:47:35,115
John?

1328
01:47:35,199 --> 01:47:38,284
No, Al, listen.
Just lay off for a while.

1329
01:47:40,287 --> 01:47:43,081
I gotta go check on something.

1330
01:47:45,835 --> 01:47:48,378
One minute, that's all I'm asking.

1331
01:47:48,462 --> 01:47:50,088
One minute to speak to them.

1332
01:47:50,172 --> 01:47:52,465
All right. Get back. Get back.

1333
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:54,926
All right, look.

1334
01:47:55,386 --> 01:47:59,556
You let me in right now,
or I call the INS, comprende?

1335
01:48:01,767 --> 01:48:03,601
This is the last time
these kids are gonna have

1336
01:48:03,686 --> 01:48:05,812
to speak to their parents.

1337
01:48:07,731 --> 01:48:08,857
All right?

1338
01:48:09,441 --> 01:48:11,276
All right. Come on. Come on.

1339
01:48:21,662 --> 01:48:23,580
What were you doing, Hans?

1340
01:48:23,831 --> 01:48:25,331
What were you doing?

1341
01:48:47,688 --> 01:48:50,857
Jesus, Mary, mother of God.

1342
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,613
Al, listen to me!
It's a double-cross!

1343
01:48:56,697 --> 01:48:58,573
The roof is wired to...

1344
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:02,702
John?

1345
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:06,581
John!

1346
01:49:06,874 --> 01:49:08,208
John, come in!

1347
01:49:08,792 --> 01:49:09,834
Did you get that?

1348
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:12,045
Something about a double-cross.

1349
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:15,423
Tell me about it.

1350
01:49:20,721 --> 01:49:23,014
We are both professionals.

1351
01:49:25,351 --> 01:49:27,018
This is personal.

1352
01:49:28,187 --> 01:49:29,562
Aww...

1353
01:49:50,793 --> 01:49:52,961
They're coming!

1354
01:49:53,545 --> 01:49:55,213
Choppers are coming.

1355
01:49:55,339 --> 01:49:58,675
Time to gather your flock,
Miss Gennero.

1356
01:49:59,635 --> 01:50:02,595
Your mom and dad
are very important people.

1357
01:50:02,680 --> 01:50:04,639
They're very brave people.

1358
01:50:05,057 --> 01:50:08,977
Is there something you'd like
to say to them, if they're watching?

1359
01:50:09,812 --> 01:50:11,771
Come home.

1360
01:50:20,698 --> 01:50:22,031
Mrs McClane.

1361
01:50:25,494 --> 01:50:28,621
How nice to make your acquaintance.

1362
01:50:32,126 --> 01:50:33,835
On your feet, everyone! To the roof!

1363
01:50:33,919 --> 01:50:36,587
Lock them up there
and come right back.

1364
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:06,993
You should have heard
your brother squeal

1365
01:51:07,077 --> 01:51:09,662
when I broke his fucking neck!

1366
01:51:13,542 --> 01:51:15,418
What do you figure the breakage?

1367
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:17,670
I figure we take out the terrorists,

1368
01:51:17,796 --> 01:51:21,090
lose 20, 25% of the hostages, tops.

1369
01:51:21,967 --> 01:51:23,926
I can live with that.

1370
01:51:24,011 --> 01:51:25,970
Get this thing on the deck.

1371
01:51:26,055 --> 01:51:29,515
They're expecting transports,
not gun ships.

1372
01:51:41,236 --> 01:51:43,321
Move it! Come on! Move!

1373
01:51:43,405 --> 01:51:44,781
Come on! Come on!

1374
01:51:44,865 --> 01:51:46,115
Move it!

1375
01:51:47,034 --> 01:51:48,493
Go! Move!

1376
01:51:52,373 --> 01:51:53,539
Theo.

1377
01:51:53,791 --> 01:51:55,249
A little bonus for us.

1378
01:51:55,334 --> 01:51:57,460
Please, sit down. Sit down!

1379
01:51:58,212 --> 01:52:00,254
A policeman's wife
might come in handy.

1380
01:52:00,339 --> 01:52:02,840
McClane, I have some news for you.

1381
01:52:04,009 --> 01:52:05,301
McClane?

1382
01:52:16,522 --> 01:52:17,814
Move!

1383
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:21,818
Come on!

1384
01:52:34,081 --> 01:52:36,374
Motherfucker! I'll kill you!

1385
01:52:40,587 --> 01:52:41,712
Armed.

1386
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:44,048
- The truck?
- The truck.

1387
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:55,101
After all your posturing,
all your little speeches,

1388
01:52:55,185 --> 01:52:57,687
you're nothing but a common thief.

1389
01:52:58,230 --> 01:53:00,314
I am an exceptional thief,
Mrs McClane.

1390
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:01,941
And since I'm moving up
to kidnapping,

1391
01:53:02,025 --> 01:53:04,026
you should be more polite.

1392
01:53:11,076 --> 01:53:13,202
You motherfucker,
I'm gonna kill you!

1393
01:53:13,287 --> 01:53:16,831
I'm gonna fuckin' cook you,
and I'm gonna fuckin' eat you!

1394
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:42,064
I don't like this, Sarge.

1395
01:53:49,656 --> 01:53:55,578
Yee-hah!
Just like fucking Saigon, eh, Slick?

1396
01:53:56,997 --> 01:53:59,874
I was in Junior High, dickhead.

1397
01:54:28,028 --> 01:54:29,028
Where's Holly?

1398
01:54:29,112 --> 01:54:30,613
Where's Holly Gennero?

1399
01:54:30,697 --> 01:54:32,615
Holly Gennero? Where's Holly?

1400
01:54:32,699 --> 01:54:34,534
Where's Holly? Where is she?

1401
01:54:34,618 --> 01:54:36,035
- They took her!
- Where?

1402
01:54:36,161 --> 01:54:37,119
The vault!

1403
01:54:37,204 --> 01:54:39,372
- Where is the vault?
- The 30th floor!

1404
01:54:39,456 --> 01:54:41,374
They just took her!

1405
01:54:42,251 --> 01:54:43,793
Get downstairs!

1406
01:54:44,211 --> 01:54:45,878
The whole fucking roof
is wired to blow!

1407
01:54:45,963 --> 01:54:46,963
Get down!

1408
01:54:47,047 --> 01:54:49,715
Get down!
Get the fuck downstairs!

1409
01:54:51,843 --> 01:54:54,720
They made us, Bureau.
Terrorist shooting hostages.

1410
01:54:54,805 --> 01:54:56,514
Break left!

1411
01:55:03,063 --> 01:55:04,730
Nail that sucker!

1412
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,616
I'm on your side, you assholes!

1413
01:55:16,535 --> 01:55:19,662
Swing around again!
I'll bag this little bastard.

1414
01:55:38,265 --> 01:55:40,099
What the fuck...

1415
01:55:41,518 --> 01:55:44,395
Oh, John,
what the fuck are you doing?

1416
01:55:45,063 --> 01:55:47,940
How the fuck
did you get into this shit?

1417
01:55:58,118 --> 01:56:01,037
There's something wrong!
They're coming back down!

1418
01:56:01,121 --> 01:56:03,122
- Blow the roof.
- But Karl's up there!

1419
01:56:03,206 --> 01:56:04,624
Blow the roof!

1420
01:56:07,794 --> 01:56:10,630
I promise I will never even think

1421
01:56:10,756 --> 01:56:13,758
about going up
in a tall building again.

1422
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:19,430
Oh, God, please don't let me die!

1423
01:57:51,064 --> 01:57:53,566
Holy Christ!

1424
01:57:54,735 --> 01:57:57,361
We're gonna need
some more FBI guys, I guess.

1425
01:58:10,375 --> 01:58:12,168
Jesus fucking Christ!

1426
01:58:12,878 --> 01:58:14,003
Fuck!

1427
01:58:38,403 --> 01:58:40,946
What the fuck is going on?

1428
01:58:43,158 --> 01:58:46,786
What are you gonna do?
Sit here while the building falls down?

1429
01:58:55,295 --> 01:58:56,295
Shit!

1430
01:58:56,963 --> 01:58:58,798
All right!

1431
01:58:59,049 --> 01:59:00,257
Hey! Hey!

1432
01:59:01,426 --> 01:59:03,010
Hang on, baby.

1433
01:59:03,094 --> 01:59:04,637
Hang on, honey.

1434
01:59:05,722 --> 01:59:06,764
Oh, God.

1435
01:59:52,185 --> 01:59:53,894
Hans!

1436
02:00:08,535 --> 02:00:09,869
Jesus.

1437
02:00:10,662 --> 02:00:12,037
Hi, honey.

1438
02:00:34,603 --> 02:00:38,564
So that's what this is all about?
A fucking robbery?

1439
02:00:38,773 --> 02:00:40,482
Put down the gun.

1440
02:00:42,027 --> 02:00:44,528
Why'd you have to nuke
the whole building, Hans?

1441
02:00:44,613 --> 02:00:46,989
Well, when you steal $600,
you can just disappear.

1442
02:00:47,073 --> 02:00:50,075
When you steal 600 million,
they will find you

1443
02:00:50,201 --> 02:00:52,828
unless they think
you're already dead.

1444
02:00:52,913 --> 02:00:55,039
Put down the gun.

1445
02:01:05,592 --> 02:01:07,259
Nein. This is mine.

1446
02:01:10,305 --> 02:01:11,931
You got me.

1447
02:01:12,015 --> 02:01:14,767
Still the cowboy, Mr McClane.

1448
02:01:14,893 --> 02:01:16,518
Americans... all alike.

1449
02:01:16,603 --> 02:01:20,940
This time, John Wayne does not walk off
into the sunset with Grace Kelly.

1450
02:01:21,024 --> 02:01:22,858
That was Gary Cooper, asshole.

1451
02:01:22,943 --> 02:01:24,401
Enough jokes.

1452
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:27,363
You'd have made a pretty
good cowboy yourself, Hans.

1453
02:01:28,114 --> 02:01:32,117
Oh, yes. What was it
you said to me before?

1454
02:01:33,036 --> 02:01:36,789
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

1455
02:01:57,310 --> 02:01:58,477
Holly!

1456
02:02:03,817 --> 02:02:05,317
Happy trails, Hans.

1457
02:02:10,657 --> 02:02:12,658
- Aah!
- Holly.

1458
02:02:50,196 --> 02:02:52,031
I hope that's not a hostage.

1459
02:03:20,143 --> 02:03:24,146
Gimme water hook-ups
for engine companies 5, 3, 9, 6.

1460
02:03:28,068 --> 02:03:30,319
Over here. It's a better angle.

1461
02:03:30,403 --> 02:03:32,321
Let's give them a hand.

1462
02:03:34,574 --> 02:03:37,659
Keep it going, now. Keep it going.

1463
02:03:42,540 --> 02:03:46,168
- Come on. We're going to miss it!
- OK. Hand me my notes!

1464
02:04:09,275 --> 02:04:13,362
What was it like in there?
How did they treat you?

1465
02:04:59,367 --> 02:05:01,118
Al, this is my wife Holly.

1466
02:05:01,202 --> 02:05:03,162
Holly Gennero.

1467
02:05:03,663 --> 02:05:05,414
Holly McClane.

1468
02:05:05,498 --> 02:05:07,166
Hello, Holly.

1469
02:05:07,250 --> 02:05:09,168
You got yourself a good man.

1470
02:05:09,294 --> 02:05:11,295
You take good care of him.

1471
02:05:11,963 --> 02:05:13,422
McClane!

1472
02:05:13,882 --> 02:05:16,258
McClane, I want a debriefing!

1473
02:05:16,676 --> 02:05:19,428
You got some things
to answer for, mister.

1474
02:05:19,512 --> 02:05:21,221
Ellis' murder, for one thing.

1475
02:05:21,306 --> 02:05:25,017
Property damage,
interfering with police business.

1476
02:06:05,934 --> 02:06:09,061
Two of you go inside
and see if there's anybody else!

1477
02:06:18,905 --> 02:06:21,490
No. This one's with me.

1478
02:06:31,960 --> 02:06:33,502
Mr McClane, Mr McClane!

1479
02:06:33,586 --> 02:06:35,879
Now that it's all over,
after this incredible ordeal,

1480
02:06:35,964 --> 02:06:37,923
what are your feelings?

1481
02:06:43,304 --> 02:06:44,388
Well, well, well.

1482
02:06:45,598 --> 02:06:48,600
- Merry Christmas, Argyle.
- Merry Christmas.

1483
02:06:52,272 --> 02:06:53,522
Did you get that?

1484
02:06:53,606 --> 02:06:55,607
Let me through.

1485
02:06:56,442 --> 02:07:00,445
If this is their idea of Christmas,
I gotta be here for New Year's.

1486
02:12:04,083 --> 02:12:05,083
English - US
