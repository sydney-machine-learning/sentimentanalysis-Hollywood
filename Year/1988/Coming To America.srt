1
00:03:40,528 --> 00:03:44,031
Good morning, your Highness.

2
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,743
Good morning, your Highness.

3
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:51,247
Good morning, your Highness.

4
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:57,670
- Happy birthday, your Highness.
- Yes, it is my birthday.

5
00:04:36,584 --> 00:04:39,003
Oha, it is my 21st birthday.

6
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:43,716
Do you think, just once,
I might use the bathroom by myself?

7
00:04:43,924 --> 00:04:47,762
Most amusing, sir.
Wipers!

8
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:09,116
The royal penis is clean,
your Highness.

9
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:09,343
His Highness
must be very excited today.

10
00:06:09,552 --> 00:06:13,347
Today is your 21st birthday.
It means you meet your wife-to-be.

11
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:16,809
How can a man get excited
about a woman he's never seen?

12
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:03,147
He certainly is quiet this morning.

13
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:06,067
He looks sad.

14
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:14,325
- Is something troubling you, my son?
- No, Father.

15
00:07:15,743 --> 00:07:22,083
I'm more than the exalted ruler
of this land and master of all I survey.

16
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,169
I'm also a concerned dad.

17
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:31,675
Well, Father... Just a moment.

18
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,930
- What is he doing?
- It looks as if he's coming here.

19
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:39,683
Wait right there, Akeem.

20
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,685
Rose bearers!

21
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,987
Akeem. Come sit.

22
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:08,212
Now, my son...
Have you grown a moustache?

23
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:11,298
Jaffe, it has been a year.

24
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:17,471
- So, what is it, my son?
- First of all, things like this.

25
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,683
- Like what?
- The rose petals.

26
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:25,604
You're the son of a king, why shouldn'
you walk on the petals of roses?

27
00:08:25,813 --> 00:08:29,233
But if there were no rose petals,
I would still be the son of a king.

28
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:32,653
Then it is settled. From this day forth,

29
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:38,617
anyone who throws roses
at my son's feet will answer to me.

30
00:08:38,826 --> 00:08:41,328
It is not just that, it is everything.

31
00:08:41,537 --> 00:08:46,041
The cooking, the pampering,
the dressing, the bathing...

32
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,919
Actually, I rather enjoy the bathing,

33
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:53,924
but I'd like to cook for myself,
dress myself, wipe my own backside.

34
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:59,805
- And why can't I find my own wife?
- Aha! So that's it?

35
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:04,852
We've gone through a lot of trouble
to select for you a very fine wife.

36
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:10,232
Since she was born, she was taught
to walk, speak and think as a queen.

37
00:09:12,526 --> 00:09:14,403
But what if I don't love her?

38
00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:17,782
It's normal to feel anxiety
about meeting your queen.

39
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,618
When I met your father, I was terrified.

40
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:23,788
I must admit, I was frightened, too.

41
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:27,416
I was so nervous, I became nauseous.

42
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:31,670
But over the years, I have grown
to love your father very much.

43
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:36,342
You see, my son, there's a fine line
between love and nausea.

44
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,678
I understand, but when I marry,

45
00:09:39,887 --> 00:09:44,058
I want the woman to love me
for who I am, not because of what I am.

46
00:09:44,266 --> 00:09:48,521
- And who are you?
- A man who's never tied his shoes.

47
00:09:48,729 --> 00:09:53,317
Wrong! You're a prince
who's never tied his shoes.

48
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:59,073
I tied my own shoes once.
It is an overrated experience.

49
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:04,787
Good morning, your Majesty.
It's another beautiful day in Zamunda.

50
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:07,540
And, Semmi, what is it now?

51
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:14,130
You look especially radiant today,
your Grace.

52
00:10:14,338 --> 00:10:20,386
I was remarking to my mother the other
day what lovely skin the Queen has.

53
00:10:20,594 --> 00:10:23,681
Semmi, don't you have somewhere
you should go?

54
00:10:25,307 --> 00:10:28,853
Yes, I was about to take the birthday
boy for his daily workout.

55
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,981
Excuse me, Father. And Mother.

56
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:38,070
Have a good day, my son.

57
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:43,284
Akeem, what happened
to the rose bearers?

58
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:51,709
Let's see if you can defend yourself,
you sweat from a baboon's balls.

59
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:15,316
So you can have a woman
who will obey your every command,

60
00:11:15,524 --> 00:11:18,986
but you'd rather have a woman
who has an opinion?

61
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:23,657
Only dogs are to obey. If you love
your wife, you'll value her opinion.

62
00:11:30,748 --> 00:11:34,543
Hippopotamus shit! You're the heir
to the throne of Zamunda.

63
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:40,591
Your wife need only have a pretty face,
firm backside and big breasts.

64
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:58,692
So you would share your bed,
and your fortune, with a beautiful fool

65
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:03,155
That's the way it's always been
with men of power. It's tradition.

66
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:10,329
It's also tradition
that times must change.

67
00:12:29,098 --> 00:12:34,687
Get your Royal Engagement T-shirt!
Step up and get your Royal T-shirt!

68
00:13:16,437 --> 00:13:20,816
- These really are delicious.
- Yes, thank you.

69
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:31,202
Your Majesty.

70
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:34,413
I am Colonel Issy.

71
00:13:34,622 --> 00:13:40,878
And today, with your blessing,
I offer my daughter to your son.

72
00:13:43,714 --> 00:13:48,219
My blessing is granted.
Let the courtship commence.

73
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:55,059
Pardon me. Step aside, please. Coming
through. Excuse me. Out of the way!

74
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:03,901
Greetings, great Prince.
Presenting Miss Imani Issi.

75
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:18,411
She's your Queen-to-be

76
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:23,040
A Queen-to-be forever

77
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:26,794
A Queen who'll do whatever

78
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:31,715
His Highness desires

79
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:38,097
She's your Queen-to-be

80
00:16:38,305 --> 00:16:42,685
A vision of perfection

81
00:16:42,893 --> 00:16:46,105
Ah object of affection

82
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:50,943
To quench your royal fire

83
00:16:51,152 --> 00:16:57,283
Completely free from infection

84
00:16:57,491 --> 00:17:00,828
To be used at your discretion

85
00:17:01,036 --> 00:17:07,585
Waiting only for your direction

86
00:17:08,836 --> 00:17:17,136
Your Queen-to-be

87
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:38,115
May I talk to you alone
for a moment, please?

88
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,206
Excuse us for a moment.

89
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:20,074
- So...
- Am I not all you dreamed I would be?

90
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:21,992
You're fine. Beautiful

91
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:26,872
But if we're going to be married, we
should talk and get to know each other.

92
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:31,544
Ever since I was born,
I have been trained to serve you.

93
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:36,382
I know, but I'd like to know about you.
What do you like to do?

94
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,552
Whatever you like.

95
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,473
- What kind of music do you like?
- Whatever kind of music you like.

96
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:49,895
I know what I like, and you know what
I like, 'cause you were trained to know,

97
00:18:50,104 --> 00:18:54,024
but I would like to know what you like.
Do you have a favourite food?

98
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,694
Good! What is your favourite food?

99
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:59,780
Whatever food you like.

100
00:19:01,115 --> 00:19:05,286
This is impossible.
I command you not to obey me.

101
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:07,621
No.

102
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:12,918
Are you saying that no matter
what I tell you to do, you will do?

103
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:15,004
Yes, your Highness.

104
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:19,258
- Ahything I say, you'll do?
- Yes, your Highness.

105
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:21,927
Bark like a dog.

106
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:27,058
A big dog.

107
00:19:29,977 --> 00:19:32,646
Hop on one leg.

108
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:37,902
Make a noise like an orang-utan.

109
00:19:40,988 --> 00:19:44,492
I see the two of you are getting along.

110
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:50,498
Excuse me, Imani, for a moment.

111
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:04,345
Fine girl, isn't she?
I told you not to worry.

112
00:20:05,388 --> 00:20:07,348
Father...

113
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:13,771
About this wedding...

114
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,232
The guests are waiting, your Majesty.

115
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,195
Let them wait! I'm talking to my son.

116
00:20:22,863 --> 00:20:25,199
Come. Let's go for a stroll.

117
00:20:38,295 --> 00:20:40,965
Hello, Babar.

118
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:51,851
Time flies. It seems only yesterday
I ordered your first diaper changed,

119
00:20:52,059 --> 00:20:56,188
and now you're a man
who's about to be married.

120
00:20:56,397 --> 00:21:00,109
She will give you much pleasure,
don't you think?

121
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,487
I'm not sure if I'm ready.

122
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:07,324
I know we never had a talk about this,

123
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:12,747
but I always assumed you had sex
with your bathers. I know I do.

124
00:21:12,955 --> 00:21:18,878
It's not that. I'm 21 years old,
and I have never left Zamunda.

125
00:21:19,086 --> 00:21:23,132
I have yet to experience
what the outside world has to offer.

126
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,219
- So you want to sow your royal oats?
- No, it's not that...

127
00:21:27,428 --> 00:21:31,182
You're right! Get out, see the world.
Enjoy yourself.

128
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,729
Fulfil every erotic desire,
and in 40 days, you will marry Imani.

129
00:21:36,937 --> 00:21:39,857
- But, Father...
- it is settled.

130
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,917
May I have your attention, please?

131
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:03,547
The wedding will proceed in 40 days.
You may go home now. Good night.

132
00:22:03,756 --> 00:22:07,760
Oha. Prepare the royal baggage.
My son is going on a trip.

133
00:22:11,055 --> 00:22:13,933
Prepare the royal baggage!

134
00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:20,606
This trip is an excellent idea.
40 days of fornication.

135
00:22:20,815 --> 00:22:26,821
Semmi. I have something else in mind.
I intend to find my bride.

136
00:22:27,822 --> 00:22:32,910
What is wrong with the one you have?
Didn't you want to rip her clothes off?

137
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,580
I want a woman who will arouse
my intellect as well as my loins.

138
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:39,750
- Where would you find such a woman?
- In America.

139
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:46,215
The land is so big,
the choices so infinite.

140
00:22:46,424 --> 00:22:50,761
Where shall we go?
Los Ahgeles or New York?

141
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,681
We'll let fate decide.

142
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:58,728
Heads, New York. Tails, Los Ahgeles.

143
00:23:01,772 --> 00:23:04,608
We go to New York.

144
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:09,196
But where in New York can one find
a woman with grace and elegance?

145
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:12,032
A woman suitable for a king.

146
00:23:15,703 --> 00:23:17,246
Queens!

147
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:38,434
Mr Frank Oznowitz. Please p¡ck up
a white courtesy telephone.

148
00:23:43,439 --> 00:23:47,943
No one here can know I am royalty.
I must appear as an average man.

149
00:23:48,152 --> 00:23:50,863
I will not say a word.

150
00:24:04,752 --> 00:24:06,837
Halt!

151
00:24:07,588 --> 00:24:10,341
You dumb fuck!

152
00:24:14,845 --> 00:24:17,473
Take us to Queens at once.

153
00:24:21,102 --> 00:24:26,315
Do you want to go to Queens?
Rich fellows should be in Manhattan.

154
00:24:26,524 --> 00:24:28,567
Stay at the Waldorf or the Palace.

155
00:24:28,776 --> 00:24:32,655
- Take us to the Palace.
- No, I want Queens.

156
00:24:32,863 --> 00:24:36,909
And we're not rich.
We're ordinary African students.

157
00:24:37,118 --> 00:24:39,995
Whatever you say, pal

158
00:24:40,204 --> 00:24:45,584
- What part of Queens do you want?
- Take us to the most common part.

159
00:24:46,335 --> 00:24:51,632
That's easy. If there's one thing
Queens got a lot of, it's common parts.

160
00:24:54,051 --> 00:24:56,178
What does "dumb fuck" mean?

161
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:30,296
- Is this shitty enough for you?
- Yes, this is perfect.

162
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:11,378
Fascinating! Semmi, look at this.

163
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:19,637
America is great indeed. A country so
free, one can throw glass on the street.

164
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:23,349
You must be
out of your goddamn m¡nd!

165
00:26:25,393 --> 00:26:27,019
Listen. Real Americans.

166
00:26:28,771 --> 00:26:31,399
Sugar Ray Robinson's
the greatest fighter that ever lived.

167
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:34,985
- What about Joe Louis?
- "The Brown Bomber".

168
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:38,489
- That was a great boxer.
- You're damn right.

169
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,575
I suppose nobody in here
ever heard of Cassius Clay.

170
00:26:41,784 --> 00:26:44,495
He's got a point. Cassius Clay
was a bad motherfucker.

171
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:46,080
I ain't saying Clay ain't bad.

172
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:51,085
I stopped liking him when he changed
his name to Muhammad Ali.

173
00:26:51,293 --> 00:26:53,379
Wait a second. Wait a second.

174
00:26:53,587 --> 00:26:58,843
A man has the right to change his name
to whatever he wants to change it to.

175
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:02,304
And if a man wants to be called
Muhammad Ali,

176
00:27:02,513 --> 00:27:08,394
you should respect his wishes
and call the man Muhammad Ali.

177
00:27:08,602 --> 00:27:12,273
His momma named him Clay.
I'm going to call him Clay.

178
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:15,818
- I say Clay.
- Get out of here.

179
00:27:16,026 --> 00:27:21,365
He'll always be Clay to me. I don'
care what he change his name to.

180
00:27:21,574 --> 00:27:24,827
Well, then you're a putz.
The three of you. Three putzes.

181
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:29,749
You should change the name from
"My-T-Sharp" to "The Three Putzes".

182
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:45,848
- What the fuck do you want?
- We desire a room.

183
00:27:46,057 --> 00:27:49,685
You'd better not be wasting my time.
You got money?

184
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:53,856
Come on in, gentlemen.

185
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:59,403
Yo, man! Get the big bag.

186
00:28:03,532 --> 00:28:09,121
Excuse me if I was brusque, but we
get boo-boos in here without a dollar.

187
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:13,459
Obviously, you gentlemen
came in on another boat.

188
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:17,171
- We seek meagre accommodations.
- Excuse me?

189
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:19,924
We require a room that is very poor.

190
00:28:25,054 --> 00:28:27,723
Hey, Stu.
Your rent's due, motherfucker.

191
00:28:27,932 --> 00:28:33,312
And don't pull that falling down the stairs
shit on me. You're conscious.

192
00:28:33,521 --> 00:28:36,774
Every month, the same damn thing...

193
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:56,502
Here we are.

194
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:02,341
There's only one bathroom on this floor,
so you have to share it.

195
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:10,307
Got a bit of an insect problem, but
you boys from Africa are used to that.

196
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:15,646
And don't use the elevator.
It's a death trap.

197
00:29:15,855 --> 00:29:20,484
This is the place that I was
telling you about. It's real fucked up.

198
00:29:20,693 --> 00:29:25,740
The window faces a brick wall.
I used to rent it to a blind man.

199
00:29:34,415 --> 00:29:38,335
It's a damn shame
what they did to that dog.

200
00:29:43,841 --> 00:29:46,010
We will take the room.

201
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,596
Yes.

202
00:30:03,402 --> 00:30:06,739
Behold, Semmi! Life. Real life.

203
00:30:06,947 --> 00:30:10,493
A thing that we have been denied
for far too long.

204
00:30:12,703 --> 00:30:16,040
- Good morn¡ng, my ne¡ghbours!
- Fuck you!

205
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:21,378
Yes! Yes! Fuck you, too!

206
00:30:40,356 --> 00:30:44,652
I suspect that these are the people
that have stolen our luggage.

207
00:30:50,074 --> 00:30:51,909
Do you want to buy
some toothbrushes?

208
00:30:52,118 --> 00:30:57,331
I've got some real fly personal
hygiene products, and a hair-dryer.

209
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:01,043
Thief! Stop thief! Come back, thief!

210
00:31:01,252 --> 00:31:04,296
- Semmi, let him go.
- Those things belong to us.

211
00:31:04,505 --> 00:31:08,718
It's good we're rid of those things.
Let them wear our princely robes.

212
00:31:08,926 --> 00:31:13,055
We're in New York now.
Let us dress as New Yorkers.

213
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:23,941
- I feel like a complete idiot.
- Don't be ridiculous.

214
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:30,573
You know, you can be all the th¡ngs
you've always wanted to be.

215
00:31:30,781 --> 00:31:33,743
Beautiful, sexy...

216
00:31:34,368 --> 00:31:37,288
One, two, three...

217
00:31:58,225 --> 00:31:59,769
Soul Glo.

218
00:32:02,146 --> 00:32:04,774
Perhaps I should cut off
my prince's lock.

219
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:09,862
You're out of your mind! Joe Louis
is the greatest boxer that ever lived.

220
00:32:10,071 --> 00:32:11,489
I'll be with you in a minute.

221
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:17,286
He was better than Clay, Sugar Ray
and that new boy - Mike Tyson.

222
00:32:17,495 --> 00:32:20,706
He was better than him, too.
He'd whip all their asses!

223
00:32:21,582 --> 00:32:25,753
- What about Rocky Marciano?
- There they go. There they go.

224
00:32:25,961 --> 00:32:30,883
Every time I talk about boxing, a white
man pulls Rocky Marciano out his ass.

225
00:32:31,092 --> 00:32:34,387
That's their one, that's their one.
"Rocky Marciano, Rocky Marciano!"

226
00:32:34,595 --> 00:32:37,556
Let me tell you something.
Rocky Marciano was good,

227
00:32:37,765 --> 00:32:41,268
but compared to Joe Louis,
Rocky Marciano ain't shit!

228
00:32:41,477 --> 00:32:43,771
He beat Joe Louis' ass.

229
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:48,734
- He did whop Joe Louis' ass.
- Joe Louis was 75 years old!

230
00:32:48,943 --> 00:32:50,903
I don't know how old he was,
but he got his ass whooped.

231
00:32:51,112 --> 00:32:55,282
Joe Louis came out of retirement
to fight Marciano. He was 76 years old.

232
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:58,202
Joe Louis always lied about his age.

233
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:00,579
Once, Frank Sinatra sat in this chair.

234
00:33:00,788 --> 00:33:04,041
I said, "Y ou hang out with Joe Louis.
How old is he?"

235
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:09,004
Frank said,
"Joe Louis is 137 years old".

236
00:33:09,213 --> 00:33:12,591
Oh, man.
You ain't never met no Frank Sinatra.

237
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:17,805
Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you!
Who's next?

238
00:33:26,647 --> 00:33:28,983
What's that? Some kind
of weave or something?

239
00:33:29,191 --> 00:33:32,153
It's my natural hair.
I've been growing it since birth.

240
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,781
What kind of chemicals
you got in there?

241
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,076
None, only juices and berries.

242
00:33:39,285 --> 00:33:43,330
That ain't nothing but Ultra-Perm.
How do you want it cut?

243
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:48,210
Just make it nice and neat.

244
00:33:56,844 --> 00:33:59,722
That'll be 8 dollars.

245
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:11,650
Tell me, Semmi. Honestly...
How do I look?

246
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:16,822
It is time to find your queen.

247
00:34:48,521 --> 00:34:51,357
I've got a secret.

248
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:54,276
I worship the devil

249
00:34:58,781 --> 00:35:04,036
See, that's the problem.
I can't find a man that can satisfy me.

250
00:35:04,245 --> 00:35:07,665
Some guys go an hour,
hour and a half. That's it.

251
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:12,670
A man's got to put in overtime
for me to get off.

252
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:16,549
I'm not interested in a man
unless he drives a B.M.W.

253
00:35:16,757 --> 00:35:21,220
Well, you know, baby, I'm almost single.
My husband's on Death Row.

254
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:27,601
This is the first date Teresa and I have
been on since the doctor separated us.

255
00:35:28,853 --> 00:35:32,314
I'm into the group thing.

256
00:35:34,108 --> 00:35:37,486
I was Joan of Arc in my former life.

257
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:43,868
My name is Peaches
And I'm the best

258
00:35:44,076 --> 00:35:46,954
All the D.J. S want
to feel my breasts

259
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:55,629
I want to work in videos, but I want to be
my own star in the video,

260
00:35:55,838 --> 00:36:01,135
because I want to be a pop singer,
a rock singer, and write my own songs.

261
00:36:01,343 --> 00:36:06,015
And then I'm going to try an actress,
'cause people tell me I'm a natural

262
00:36:06,223 --> 00:36:11,437
Then I'm going to write and direct
my own stories, produce the movies...

263
00:36:25,076 --> 00:36:27,661
I hope you don't mind me coming over
and sitting down.

264
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:33,250
But I've been watching you all evening,
and I want to tear you apart.

265
00:36:35,169 --> 00:36:37,797
And your friend, too.

266
00:36:41,384 --> 00:36:46,931
Does every woman in New York
have a severe emotional problem?

267
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:50,101
I doubt we will ever find your queen.

268
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:56,982
- Mr Clarence.
- The boys from Africa! How are you?

269
00:36:57,608 --> 00:37:02,822
- Where can one find nice women here?
- You've got to get out and look.

270
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,032
We've been to every bar in Queens.

271
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:07,868
You can't go to no bar
to find a nice woman.

272
00:37:08,077 --> 00:37:13,624
You've got to go to nice places,
like the library and church.

273
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:17,044
Or this place, where I'm going tonight.
The Black Awareness Rally.

274
00:37:17,253 --> 00:37:20,589
There's going to be
some fine women there. Clean girls.

275
00:37:28,013 --> 00:37:31,183
I didn't come here
to preach to you today.

276
00:37:36,105 --> 00:37:42,194
But when I look at these contestants
for The Miss Black Awareness pageant,

277
00:37:42,403 --> 00:37:48,117
I feel good, 'cause I know
there's a God somewhere.

278
00:37:48,325 --> 00:37:50,411
There's a God somewhere.

279
00:37:50,619 --> 00:37:52,830
Turn around, ladies.

280
00:37:53,038 --> 00:37:57,460
You know there's a God
who sits up high, and looks down low.

281
00:37:57,668 --> 00:38:00,337
Man cannot make it like this.

282
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:03,924
Larry Flint, Hugh Hefner...
They can take the picture,

283
00:38:04,133 --> 00:38:09,638
but they can't make it.
Only God above can make it for ya.

284
00:38:09,847 --> 00:38:14,935
These are the best women Queens has
to offer. Pick one, and let's go home.

285
00:38:15,144 --> 00:38:16,937
Be patient, my friend.

286
00:38:17,146 --> 00:38:21,067
Do you love him? Do you feel joy?
Say "joy"!

287
00:38:21,275 --> 00:38:23,903
- Joy!
- Joy.

288
00:38:24,111 --> 00:38:25,780
- Joy!
- Joy!

289
00:38:25,988 --> 00:38:31,118
- Can I get a "Amen"?
- Amen, brother!

290
00:38:31,327 --> 00:38:34,163
Don't be ashamed to call his name.

291
00:38:34,371 --> 00:38:35,706
Yes, Lord!

292
00:38:35,915 --> 00:38:39,877
Only God can give that woman
that kind of joy.

293
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:45,383
- Make a joyful noise unto the Lord.
- Joy!

294
00:38:45,591 --> 00:38:48,427
- I am very happy to be here.
- Amen!

295
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,974
Can I get a "Amen"?

296
00:38:55,351 --> 00:39:01,107
I don't know what you've come to do,
but I've come to praise His name.

297
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:04,610
Lord, Lord...

298
00:39:06,862 --> 00:39:10,658
Girls, you can leave now.
Thank you very much.

299
00:39:10,866 --> 00:39:13,744
There's a God somewhere.

300
00:39:14,912 --> 00:39:17,790
I've got a special treat for you
this evening.

301
00:39:17,998 --> 00:39:22,002
A young man, that you all know
as Joe the policeman

302
00:39:22,211 --> 00:39:26,048
from the "What's Going Down"
episode of "That's My Momma".

303
00:39:26,257 --> 00:39:30,094
I want you to put your hands together
and welcome him to the stage.

304
00:39:30,302 --> 00:39:34,306
A big round of applause
for Jackson Height's own

305
00:39:34,515 --> 00:39:39,520
Mr Randy Watson! Randy Watson.

306
00:39:39,729 --> 00:39:43,399
- That boy's good.
- Good and terrible.

307
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:46,861
And Reverend Brown.

308
00:39:47,069 --> 00:39:51,240
He's been my reverend since
I was a little boy, and I love him dearly.

309
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:57,037
You're a very special man.
Reverend Brown! Reverend Brown.

310
00:39:58,372 --> 00:40:04,378
It feels so lovely to be here tonight.
Give yourselves a round of applause.

311
00:40:04,587 --> 00:40:09,508
Give a big round of applause
to my band, Sexual Chocolate.

312
00:40:13,471 --> 00:40:18,059
Sexual Chocolate.
They play so fine, don't you agree?

313
00:40:38,162 --> 00:40:42,291
- Some of the good stuff? Coming up.
- Do you want a Coke?

314
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:47,671
- Enjoying the show?
- Enjoy, young man.

315
00:41:15,157 --> 00:41:17,952
Sexy Chocolate!

316
00:41:19,328 --> 00:41:20,663
Sexy Chocolate!

317
00:41:26,085 --> 00:41:30,381
- Goddamn, that boy can sing.
- You must be crazy.

318
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:42,852
Put your hands together
for Mr Randy Watson.

319
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:47,022
Yeah, one more time!
Randy Watson, how about it!

320
00:41:47,231 --> 00:41:51,902
Before we go any further,
I'd like to thank Mr Cleo McDowell,

321
00:41:52,111 --> 00:41:56,657
who's responsible for the fine food
and beverage here tonight.

322
00:41:56,866 --> 00:42:00,536
Cleo, I know you're proud
of your daughters. We are, too.

323
00:42:00,745 --> 00:42:04,081
Please welcome one of the organisers
of tonight's festivities.

324
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:07,543
Miss Lisa McDowell.
Lisa, come up here, baby girl

325
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:12,381
- Work in a plug for the new salad bar.
- I'm not mentioning the restaurant.

326
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:15,593
At least give them the address.

327
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:24,310
Someone ought to put you on a plate
and suck you up with a biscuit.

328
00:42:28,147 --> 00:42:33,944
Black Awareness Week is
an opportunity for self -expression.

329
00:42:34,153 --> 00:42:36,989
- May we leave now?
- No, wait.

330
00:42:37,198 --> 00:42:43,162
...express himself through song.
In his own unique way, but...

331
00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:46,123
The song makes a good point.

332
00:42:46,332 --> 00:42:48,834
The ch¡ldren are our future,

333
00:42:49,043 --> 00:42:54,048
and it's up to all of us to provide a place
where children can express themselves.

334
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:58,427
We need to rebuild Lincoln Park.

335
00:42:59,303 --> 00:43:05,393
Ushers are passing with donation
baskets, so please - give all you can.

336
00:43:06,811 --> 00:43:10,272
We're happy to get
the kind of money that jingles,

337
00:43:10,481 --> 00:43:13,150
but we'd rather get the kind that folds.

338
00:43:22,326 --> 00:43:25,704
- Donations. Donations!
- I thought it was the trash.

339
00:43:25,913 --> 00:43:28,249
- Stupid ass.
- I'll whip your ass.

340
00:43:28,457 --> 00:43:33,879
- You tar-black motherfucker.
- There's women here. Calm down.

341
00:43:46,183 --> 00:43:48,352
Thank you.

342
00:43:52,231 --> 00:43:55,818
- She is wonderful
- Akeem...

343
00:43:56,527 --> 00:44:01,240
You can see Lisa, and Mr McDowell,
at McDowell's Restaurant,

344
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:05,661
8507, Queens Boulevard.

345
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:08,497
8507, Queens Boulevard.

346
00:44:20,718 --> 00:44:24,263
Your first job every morning
will be to sweep this walkway.

347
00:44:24,472 --> 00:44:28,434
Then I want you to wash
all the windows. Real good, too.

348
00:44:28,642 --> 00:44:31,729
And don't leave no streaks.

349
00:44:34,815 --> 00:44:38,110
What are you doing?

350
00:44:39,653 --> 00:44:43,282
Get the hell out of here
before I bust that camera!

351
00:44:46,994 --> 00:44:52,249
Me and the McDonald's people,
we've got this little misunderstanding.

352
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,673
See, they're "McDonald's".
I'm "McDowell's".

353
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:06,722
They've got the golden arches.
Mine are the golden arcs.

354
00:45:09,683 --> 00:45:12,603
They've got the Big Mac.
I've got the Big Mick.

355
00:45:12,812 --> 00:45:17,316
We both got two all -beef patties, sauce,
lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions.

356
00:45:17,525 --> 00:45:23,364
But they use a sesame seed bun.
My buns have no seeds.

357
00:45:25,449 --> 00:45:28,119
I've got it.

358
00:45:30,996 --> 00:45:35,334
You've got to mop the food-prep area
twice a day.

359
00:45:35,543 --> 00:45:39,088
- Do you know how to mop?
- Yes, of course.

360
00:45:39,964 --> 00:45:42,258
There you go.

361
00:45:55,938 --> 00:46:00,109
Don't use the bucket.
It'll just confuse you.

362
00:46:00,317 --> 00:46:04,572
When you get through here,
you take out the trash.

363
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:08,617
Come with me,
I've got an easy job for you.

364
00:46:39,273 --> 00:46:43,152
- Hi!
- Hello.

365
00:46:45,488 --> 00:46:47,740
Hello.

366
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:51,160
Hi...

367
00:46:52,286 --> 00:46:54,747
I am Akeem.

368
00:46:56,374 --> 00:46:59,502
It's nice to meet you, Akeem.

369
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:05,174
I've been placed in charge of garbage.
Do you have any that needs disposal

370
00:47:05,383 --> 00:47:08,636
No, it's totally empty.

371
00:47:09,762 --> 00:47:14,350
When it fills up, don't be afraid
to call me. I'll take it out urgently.

372
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:18,187
That's good to know.

373
00:47:18,396 --> 00:47:22,358
When you think of garbage,
think of Akeem.

374
00:47:24,485 --> 00:47:28,155
Well, I have to get back
to my sanitation duties.

375
00:47:28,364 --> 00:47:33,452
Maybe we will have a chance
to talk again on a professional level

376
00:47:35,037 --> 00:47:37,331
Goodbye, Akeem.

377
00:48:35,389 --> 00:48:39,769
Darryl You're looking sharp.

378
00:48:39,977 --> 00:48:44,190
How about a Mick-Shake?
I believe strawberry is your favourite.

379
00:48:44,398 --> 00:48:46,067
Straw.

380
00:48:46,275 --> 00:48:50,946
Lisa's in the back.
She's waiting for you. Come on.

381
00:48:52,948 --> 00:48:56,327
- How's everything at Soul Glo?
- Fine.

382
00:48:56,535 --> 00:48:59,747
Our home weave products
are really taking off.

383
00:48:59,955 --> 00:49:05,252
Dad isn't using the tickets for the Jets
game. I thought you might enjoy them.

384
00:49:05,461 --> 00:49:08,839
That's very considerate of you.
Thank you!

385
00:49:11,342 --> 00:49:15,012
- Lisa! Look who's here, honey.
- Hi!

386
00:49:15,221 --> 00:49:18,682
You two kids have a good time,
you hear?

387
00:49:23,396 --> 00:49:25,189
- Ready?
- Sure.

388
00:49:26,273 --> 00:49:28,692
I want to ask you something.

389
00:49:28,901 --> 00:49:34,532
At the rally, someone stuck a large
amount of cash in one of the boxes.

390
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,119
You wouldn't happen to know
who that was, would you?

391
00:49:40,204 --> 00:49:43,666
- Well, I...
- I thought it was you!

392
00:49:44,709 --> 00:49:47,962
You know me. Ahything for the kids.

393
00:49:54,468 --> 00:49:57,096
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

394
00:50:00,391 --> 00:50:05,354
I got four tickets to the St. John's game.
Maybe your sister can bring someone.

395
00:50:05,563 --> 00:50:08,941
Take care of this, will you?

396
00:50:21,162 --> 00:50:24,373
- Excuse me.
- Hey, it's Kunta Kinte.

397
00:50:29,003 --> 00:50:31,464
What can I do you for?

398
00:50:34,508 --> 00:50:38,471
- Can you make my hair look like this?
- Why would you want that?

399
00:50:38,679 --> 00:50:40,848
I like your hair, it's natural

400
00:50:41,057 --> 00:50:44,977
I wish more children would wear their
hair natural, like Martin Luther King.

401
00:50:45,186 --> 00:50:50,983
You ain't never seen Martin Luther King
with no messy curls on his head.

402
00:50:51,192 --> 00:50:55,529
- I met Dr Martin Luther King once.
- You're lying, you ain't never met him.

403
00:50:55,738 --> 00:50:58,741
I met him in 1962
in Memphis, Tennessee.

404
00:50:58,949 --> 00:51:01,744
I'm walking down the street
minding my own business.

405
00:51:01,952 --> 00:51:04,663
I walk round the corner,
and a man hits me in the chest.

406
00:51:04,872 --> 00:51:07,458
I fall on the ground. I look up,
and it's Martin Luther King.

407
00:51:07,666 --> 00:51:11,170
I said, "Dr King." He said,
"Oops, I thought it was someone else."

408
00:51:11,379 --> 00:51:14,215
- You never met Martin Luther King.
- He knocked me over.

409
00:51:14,423 --> 00:51:16,842
- No, he didn'.
- Yes, he did.

410
00:51:17,051 --> 00:51:18,886
Why do you worry about how you look?

411
00:51:19,095 --> 00:51:23,391
I'm trying to gain the interest
of a certain young lady.

412
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,061
I ain't heard no woman give no man
no lovin' 'cause his hair looks good.

413
00:51:27,269 --> 00:51:30,898
- That's right.
- Is this an American girl

414
00:51:32,608 --> 00:51:36,570
You got to go through her papa. People
don't know that about American women.

415
00:51:36,779 --> 00:51:38,614
Ain't nothing to do with your hair
or your pocket.

416
00:51:38,823 --> 00:51:43,202
You get in good with American
woman's father, you in good with her.

417
00:51:43,411 --> 00:51:46,747
Get in good with the father,
you home free.

418
00:51:46,956 --> 00:51:50,084
- Home free.
- Like a bird.

419
00:52:00,428 --> 00:52:03,305
- Mr McDowell.
- What is it?

420
00:52:04,265 --> 00:52:09,228
Sir, did you catch the professional
football contest on television last night?

421
00:52:10,688 --> 00:52:13,691
- No, I didn'.
- It was most exhilarating.

422
00:52:13,899 --> 00:52:16,861
The Giants of New York
took on the Packers of Green Bay.

423
00:52:17,069 --> 00:52:22,074
The Giants triumphed by kicking
an oblong pigskin ball through a big "H".

424
00:52:22,283 --> 00:52:24,368
It was a ripping victory.

425
00:52:26,662 --> 00:52:30,916
Son, and I'm just going
to tell you this one time.

426
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:34,295
You want to keep working here,
stay off the drugs.

427
00:52:35,755 --> 00:52:38,174
Yes, sir.

428
00:52:43,554 --> 00:52:48,059
I don't know how it is in Africa,
but here rich guys get all the chicks.

429
00:52:53,481 --> 00:52:58,027
- He must work very hard.
- The Prince of Soul Glo?

430
00:52:58,235 --> 00:53:02,490
No way.
He lives off his father's invention.

431
00:53:02,698 --> 00:53:07,828
He can buy her anything he wants. How
are you going to compete with that?

432
00:53:35,064 --> 00:53:37,525
I'll get it.

433
00:53:45,157 --> 00:53:48,119
- Delivery for Miss Lisa McDowell.
- I'll take it, I'm her sister.

434
00:53:48,327 --> 00:53:50,955
Would you sign here, please?

435
00:53:59,213 --> 00:54:03,050
- What is it?
- Something for you.

436
00:54:03,259 --> 00:54:06,220
Do you mind if I open it?

437
00:54:10,474 --> 00:54:13,728
- Do you think they're real
- They couldn't be.

438
00:54:16,939 --> 00:54:20,192
"From an admirer. Not Darryl"

439
00:54:20,401 --> 00:54:23,446
- Somebody's messing around.
- I am not.

440
00:54:24,363 --> 00:54:26,574
I don't care
how much a man admires you.

441
00:54:26,782 --> 00:54:30,703
He's not giving you earrings like that
unless you've given him booty.

442
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:36,751
- Not everybody thinks like you.
- They do, but they don't admit it.

443
00:54:54,143 --> 00:54:58,105
Do you realise I have not had sex
since we got to America?

444
00:54:58,314 --> 00:55:01,233
Semmi, look. There she is.

445
00:55:02,276 --> 00:55:04,737
- I'm going to talk to her.
- Good.

446
00:55:04,945 --> 00:55:07,531
Tell her you sent her the 500,000 dollar
pair of earrings.

447
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:11,911
She will fall into your arms, and we
can leave this god-forsaken place.

448
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:13,954
- I cannot do that.
- Do something.

449
00:55:14,163 --> 00:55:18,876
- Do not worry, I have a plan.
- To mop your way into her heart?

450
00:55:19,085 --> 00:55:22,588
- That's not fair.
- Nor is me doing manual labour.

451
00:55:24,465 --> 00:55:27,760
- I'm badly in need of a manicure.
- Listen to you...

452
00:55:27,968 --> 00:55:30,930
"I'm badly in need of a manicure."

453
00:55:31,138 --> 00:55:34,392
Are you going to say something?

454
00:55:38,104 --> 00:55:42,817
- Hey, Akeem! This is my sister, Patrice.
- Hello, how are you?

455
00:55:43,025 --> 00:55:46,862
- Akeem's from Africa.
- What are you doing in New York?

456
00:55:47,071 --> 00:55:50,449
- I'm a student.
- What school are you going to?

457
00:55:50,658 --> 00:55:53,494
I go to the University.

458
00:55:53,703 --> 00:55:55,287
Which one?

459
00:55:57,415 --> 00:56:00,209
The University of the United States.

460
00:56:01,961 --> 00:56:04,171
I've never heard of that.

461
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:07,925
It's a very small university.
We don't even have a basketball team.

462
00:56:08,134 --> 00:56:13,556
Really? We've got an extra ticket
for the St. John's game. Want to come?

463
00:56:15,099 --> 00:56:16,642
Yes.

464
00:56:16,851 --> 00:56:20,396
You can double -date
with me and Darryl

465
00:56:46,297 --> 00:56:48,591
In his face! In his face!

466
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,552
Yes! In the face!

467
00:56:55,056 --> 00:56:58,142
Why don't you take off yourjacket,
Akeem?

468
00:56:58,350 --> 00:57:01,854
"Put it in the face," right? I like this.

469
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:06,108
- Isn't that better?
- Yes, thank you very much.

470
00:57:13,824 --> 00:57:17,495
Wearing clothes must be
a new experience for you.

471
00:57:17,703 --> 00:57:21,749
- Are you able to follow the game?
- Oh, yes!

472
00:57:21,957 --> 00:57:25,211
I'm following the game quite well.

473
00:57:27,046 --> 00:57:31,008
What kind of games do you play
in Africa? Chase the monkey?

474
00:57:32,426 --> 00:57:35,805
No, we play football.
I believe you call it soccer.

475
00:57:36,013 --> 00:57:37,890
Yeah, right. Soccer.

476
00:57:38,099 --> 00:57:44,021
That's a real cute sport. Especially the
way you bounce the ball off your heads.

477
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:48,192
I don't like any sport
where you don't use your hands.

478
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:51,779
Yes! Yes!

479
00:57:51,987 --> 00:57:55,908
What are you doing?
It's just the half -time?

480
00:57:56,951 --> 00:58:01,038
This is my favourite part of the game.
Will you excuse me for a moment?

481
00:58:01,247 --> 00:58:04,834
Excuse me. I'll be back in a minute.

482
00:58:19,306 --> 00:58:22,643
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness, it is you!

483
00:58:23,728 --> 00:58:26,063
I cannot believe it.

484
00:58:29,108 --> 00:58:33,028
- Greetings, your Highness.
- Please, stop bowing.

485
00:58:33,237 --> 00:58:37,408
- I am a loyal citizen of Zamunda.
- You will spill your beverages.

486
00:58:38,534 --> 00:58:41,704
This is the greatest day of my life.

487
00:58:42,621 --> 00:58:46,667
It was very nice meeting you, too.
Excuse me.

488
00:58:50,254 --> 00:58:54,925
Please! Please, may I just have
my picture taken with you?

489
00:59:06,312 --> 00:59:11,901
I will cherish this experience
for the rest of my life.

490
00:59:17,865 --> 00:59:20,743
For the rest of my life.

491
00:59:23,204 --> 00:59:27,625
- Who was that?
- Just a man I met in the restroom.

492
00:59:35,299 --> 00:59:39,637
- Why don't you quit this job?
- Because I like it here.

493
00:59:39,845 --> 00:59:43,641
But you're my lady.
My lady doesn't have to work.

494
00:59:44,975 --> 00:59:48,521
I'll take care of you.
Get you anything you want.

495
00:59:49,772 --> 00:59:52,691
- What can I get you?
- Nothing.

496
00:59:54,652 --> 00:59:57,780
I'll get you some... coffee.

497
00:59:59,156 --> 01:00:01,909
I'll be right back.

498
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:11,836
Hey, Akeem. Did you have
a good time at the game?

499
01:00:12,044 --> 01:00:13,462
Yes, I did.

500
01:00:13,671 --> 01:00:17,258
I hope Darryl didn't offend you.
He can be pretty obnoxious.

501
01:00:17,466 --> 01:00:21,512
- He cannot help it.
- Sit down, take a break for a minute.

502
01:00:25,224 --> 01:00:27,685
You're an unusual guy.

503
01:00:27,893 --> 01:00:31,021
I've never seen anybody take
so much pride in mopping a floor.

504
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:35,317
"He who would learn to fly
must first learn to stand and walk."

505
01:00:35,526 --> 01:00:40,406
"One cannot fly into flying."
That's not mine, that's Nietzsche's.

506
01:00:40,614 --> 01:00:44,452
That's what I mean. The guys
that work here don't quote Nietzsche.

507
01:00:49,582 --> 01:00:52,918
Everybody shut up and do what I say.

508
01:00:53,127 --> 01:00:57,631
Get the money out!
Stay cool, nobody gets hurt.

509
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,301
Take the money out! All of it.

510
01:01:00,509 --> 01:01:03,596
Don't stall me, fat boy. Let's go.

511
01:01:03,804 --> 01:01:07,391
Come on! You're wasting my time.
Come on!

512
01:01:10,853 --> 01:01:13,856
Ahybody move,
I'll blow your fucking head off.

513
01:01:14,065 --> 01:01:17,318
What are you looking at, buddy?

514
01:01:19,195 --> 01:01:22,865
Come on! Stop stalling.

515
01:01:25,368 --> 01:01:29,538
Come on. Don't stall me. All of it!

516
01:01:34,627 --> 01:01:38,422
- Come on!
- Excuse me for a moment.

517
01:01:44,637 --> 01:01:46,597
It would be wise for you
to put the weapon down.

518
01:01:46,806 --> 01:01:49,016
Who is this asshole?

519
01:01:50,643 --> 01:01:55,356
Please refrain from using any more
obscenities in front of these people.

520
01:01:55,564 --> 01:01:58,234
I've warned you.
I'll be forced to thrash you.

521
01:01:58,442 --> 01:02:00,444
Fuck you!

522
01:02:05,741 --> 01:02:09,370
Freeze,
you diseased rhinoceros' pizzle.

523
01:02:21,674 --> 01:02:26,387
Hey, fellas. I'm real proud of the job
you did in there today.

524
01:02:26,595 --> 01:02:29,140
We've been hit by that guy five times,

525
01:02:29,348 --> 01:02:34,311
but I don't think he's coming back,
thanks to my African connections.

526
01:02:36,063 --> 01:02:41,652
Leave Sunday night open.
I'm having a get-together at my house.

527
01:02:43,362 --> 01:02:45,489
You see?
He has accepted us as equals.

528
01:02:48,325 --> 01:02:53,122
OK, fellas. Give them a ticket, take their
keys and park the cars down the street.

529
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:56,167
When you're finished, come inside
and help out in the kitchen.

530
01:02:56,375 --> 01:03:02,214
Akeem, I want to show you
the inside of McDowell's little castle.

531
01:03:07,011 --> 01:03:12,183
This here is my showplace.
It pretty much speaks for itself.

532
01:03:13,434 --> 01:03:20,066
When I grew up, nine of us lived
in a shack no bigger than this room.

533
01:03:20,775 --> 01:03:23,944
And look what I have today.

534
01:03:24,153 --> 01:03:27,406
I only wish Mrs McDowell
could have lived to see it.

535
01:03:27,615 --> 01:03:31,452
- You have a fine house, sir.
- Thank you.

536
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:37,166
In 20 or 30 years, with hard work,
maybe you could have a place like this.

537
01:03:40,753 --> 01:03:43,339
- That would be something.
- Wouldn't it?

538
01:03:47,301 --> 01:03:50,930
This is where you're going
to be working tonight.

539
01:03:59,522 --> 01:04:04,318
- Ever open a champagne bottle?
- I have seen it done before.

540
01:04:04,527 --> 01:04:07,321
Make sure you keep all the glasses full.

541
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:11,951
I'd better get dressed. Make yourself
comfortable 'til the guests arrive.

542
01:04:15,121 --> 01:04:20,793
I love the Lord. Do you understand
what I'm saying? I love the Lord.

543
01:04:21,001 --> 01:04:24,964
And if loving the Lord is wrong,
I don't want to be right.

544
01:04:25,172 --> 01:04:30,761
Hi, Mike. Good to see you. Enjoy, drink
up. Lots more where that came from.

545
01:04:31,011 --> 01:04:35,182
Hey, Randy! Good to see you.
Watch out for this guy.

546
01:04:35,391 --> 01:04:37,184
Big Ed, my man!

547
01:04:38,227 --> 01:04:42,648
You know, I can appreciate the way
you handled that dude with the gun.

548
01:04:43,274 --> 01:04:46,152
I would've helped you out, except...

549
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,405
I had a cup of coffee in my hand.
You understand, right?

550
01:04:49,613 --> 01:04:55,327
I bet you learnt all that stuff
fighting lions and tigers and shit.

551
01:04:55,536 --> 01:04:59,165
Yes, where I'm from,
we have to be very aggressive.

552
01:04:59,373 --> 01:05:03,044
I'm all for that. Especially with women.

553
01:05:03,836 --> 01:05:06,630
They may not admit it...

554
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:11,594
...but they all want
a man to take charge.

555
01:05:16,307 --> 01:05:19,393
Tell them what to do.

556
01:05:27,234 --> 01:05:29,445
That's one of the things
I want to talk to you...

557
01:05:29,653 --> 01:05:34,158
Darryl, your mother gets lovelier
every time I see her.

558
01:05:34,367 --> 01:05:39,330
- Cleo, I'd like to talk to you alone.
- Sure. Excuse us.

559
01:05:39,538 --> 01:05:42,833
- Mum, Dad, Grandma...
- Sure, son.

560
01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:47,380
I like the fries better at McDonald's,
but I'd never tell Mr McDowell that.

561
01:05:49,507 --> 01:05:52,510
Make sure everybody's glass
is kept full.

562
01:05:52,718 --> 01:05:56,472
We're about to make
a very special announcement.

563
01:06:01,018 --> 01:06:04,313
May I have
everyone's attention, please.

564
01:06:08,025 --> 01:06:13,364
Mr and Mrs Jenks, would you join me?
Mother Jenks, you come up here, too.

565
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:26,252
I've just heard some news
that makes me a very happy man.

566
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:28,003
Semmi, please...

567
01:06:30,548 --> 01:06:32,883
Champagne.

568
01:06:34,051 --> 01:06:36,971
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

569
01:06:37,179 --> 01:06:40,641
Okay, get going. Get out of here. Go on.

570
01:06:42,768 --> 01:06:48,524
As you know, Darryl and Lisa have
been going together for quite some time.

571
01:06:48,733 --> 01:06:53,904
I'm pleased to announce
that Darryl just popped the big question.

572
01:06:56,157 --> 01:06:59,452
And Lisa happily accepted.

573
01:07:06,751 --> 01:07:10,379
So as it turns out, this has become
an engagement party.

574
01:07:11,172 --> 01:07:14,759
Amen! Praise the Lord.

575
01:07:14,967 --> 01:07:19,138
- Married?
- To the bride and groom.

576
01:07:19,346 --> 01:07:21,348
To the bride and groom!

577
01:07:21,557 --> 01:07:23,684
To the bride and groom.

578
01:07:31,192 --> 01:07:35,362
I want you and that young man
to tie that knot. I'll pray for you.

579
01:07:35,571 --> 01:07:38,532
And I want you to hold on
to God's unchanging hand.

580
01:07:38,741 --> 01:07:42,411
'Cause he helped Joshua
fight the battle of Jericho.

581
01:07:43,662 --> 01:07:46,540
And he helped Daniel
get out of the lion's den.

582
01:07:46,749 --> 01:07:50,920
He helped Gilligan get off the island.
Lord!

583
01:07:51,128 --> 01:07:54,173
I want to talk to you, now!

584
01:08:04,266 --> 01:08:09,313
The next time you and my father
plan my life, let me in on it.

585
01:08:09,522 --> 01:08:11,899
- It's not like...
- Don't touch me!

586
01:08:12,108 --> 01:08:15,403
But baby, it's our engagement party.

587
01:08:26,622 --> 01:08:28,582
Thanks.

588
01:08:35,756 --> 01:08:41,303
- Would you like some champagne?
- No, I don't feel like celebrating.

589
01:08:43,806 --> 01:08:48,394
Wait. Sit down and keep me company.

590
01:08:57,278 --> 01:09:00,948
If you're going to hang out with me,
you've got to loosen up.

591
01:09:01,157 --> 01:09:03,993
I can be loose. See?

592
01:09:05,327 --> 01:09:07,329
Much better.

593
01:09:08,998 --> 01:09:11,959
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

594
01:09:12,168 --> 01:09:17,006
But I won't be pressured into marriage,
not by Darryl, my father or anybody.

595
01:09:17,965 --> 01:09:21,510
I understand.
In my country they arrange marriages,

596
01:09:21,719 --> 01:09:24,430
but no one should marry
out of obligation.

597
01:09:24,638 --> 01:09:30,269
You're right. How could I even have
considered marrying a guy like Darryl

598
01:09:30,478 --> 01:09:36,108
- I wondered the same thing.
- He made me so furious back there.

599
01:09:36,317 --> 01:09:41,322
- Do you think I overreacted?
- The first reaction is often correct.

600
01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:47,495
You're very easy to talk to.
I feel like I could tell you anything.

601
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:57,922
Hey, Akeem. We need
some more champagne over here.

602
01:09:59,715 --> 01:10:02,927
I almost forgot that I was here
in a domestic capacity.

603
01:10:03,135 --> 01:10:07,515
Thanks for listening to me, Akeem.
I really appreciate it.

604
01:10:07,723 --> 01:10:10,893
Ahy time, Lisa McDowell.

605
01:10:15,731 --> 01:10:18,317
Hey! Be careful

606
01:10:19,568 --> 01:10:22,905
I think my sister likes you.

607
01:10:30,246 --> 01:10:32,248
Semmi!

608
01:10:34,875 --> 01:10:36,919
Semmi.

609
01:10:41,632 --> 01:10:47,972
- Come, you're going to be late for work.
- So what if I am?

610
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:52,977
We cannot anger Mr McDowell.
Things are going so well with Lisa.

611
01:10:53,185 --> 01:10:57,064
I do not care.
I'm not going to work today.

612
01:10:57,314 --> 01:11:00,401
Yes, you are going to work today.

613
01:11:01,444 --> 01:11:03,988
I'm sick of living like a peasant.
Look at this filth.

614
01:11:04,196 --> 01:11:08,659
Do you want to live better? Fine.
Fix this place up.

615
01:11:08,868 --> 01:11:11,537
But you are going to work today!

616
01:11:21,422 --> 01:11:23,591
- Hello!
- Hi!

617
01:11:23,799 --> 01:11:27,511
I started on clean-up just like you guys,
but now...

618
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:32,892
See, I'm washing lettuce.
Soon, I'll be on fries. Then the grill.

619
01:11:33,726 --> 01:11:36,771
In a year or two,
I'll make assistant manager

620
01:11:36,979 --> 01:11:40,274
and that's where the big bucks
start rolling in.

621
01:11:40,483 --> 01:11:43,319
Just two years, huh?

622
01:11:47,031 --> 01:11:52,411
Maybe I've stayed with him
because everyone expected me to.

623
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:56,540
- You must be tired of my problems.
- No, not at all.

624
01:11:57,833 --> 01:12:00,586
I feel like I owe you a favour.

625
01:12:00,795 --> 01:12:05,716
Come to my house and I'll fix
you dinner. Patrice will be there.

626
01:12:05,925 --> 01:12:10,304
Let's go to my house.
I'd like to cook for you.

627
01:12:10,513 --> 01:12:14,141
- You cook?
- I dabble a little, yes.

628
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:17,269
Great! Tell you what,
I'll buy the groceries.

629
01:12:17,478 --> 01:12:22,817
Fine. But I have to warn you.
My home is very poor.

630
01:12:23,025 --> 01:12:27,321
I don't care about that.
I'd love to see where you live.

631
01:12:40,876 --> 01:12:43,879
Welcome to my humble abode.

632
01:12:52,596 --> 01:12:56,392
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

633
01:12:56,600 --> 01:13:00,896
Everything's fine.
Excuse me for a moment, please.

634
01:13:05,151 --> 01:13:08,779
- What have you done?
- You told me to fix up the place.

635
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:14,618
I should kill you!
I'm supposed to be a poor man.

636
01:13:14,827 --> 01:13:17,830
Akeem? Akeem.

637
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:22,877
- Is everything all right?
- Everything is fine.

638
01:13:23,085 --> 01:13:25,838
Excuse me, I have to tidy up.

639
01:13:42,021 --> 01:13:44,690
What are you doing?

640
01:13:46,817 --> 01:13:50,404
For God's sake,
do not take my pocket money.

641
01:13:55,076 --> 01:13:58,245
If you have no more money,
you can cause no more mischief.

642
01:13:58,454 --> 01:14:01,207
You are being unreasonable.

643
01:14:01,415 --> 01:14:07,338
If you have ruined my chances
with Lisa, I will never forgive you.

644
01:14:10,674 --> 01:14:13,177
- I'm very sorry.
- Can we go in now?

645
01:14:13,386 --> 01:14:16,430
- No, we cannot.
- Why not?

646
01:14:16,639 --> 01:14:20,059
There's a big rat inside.

647
01:14:20,267 --> 01:14:22,978
I think there is no rat.

648
01:14:23,187 --> 01:14:28,651
You're so ashamed of your apartment
you can't even let me see it.

649
01:14:28,859 --> 01:14:32,196
Once again, you have judged correctly.

650
01:14:32,405 --> 01:14:37,201
- If it bothers you, we can go out to eat.
- That would be much better.

651
01:15:03,018 --> 01:15:05,688
Excuse me for a moment, please.

652
01:15:15,239 --> 01:15:19,994
- What did you give him?
- I just gave him some pocket change.

653
01:15:34,675 --> 01:15:37,887
- Randolph...
- Leave me alone, Mortimer.

654
01:15:38,095 --> 01:15:41,057
Randolph! Randolph!

655
01:15:42,767 --> 01:15:46,812
- I'm still not talking to you.
- Look!

656
01:15:53,778 --> 01:15:57,156
Mortimer, we're back.

657
01:15:57,365 --> 01:16:00,076
Yeah!

658
01:16:00,785 --> 01:16:03,162
To America!

659
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:09,460
Why did you come here?

660
01:16:09,668 --> 01:16:13,172
- To find something special
- it's a long way to travel

661
01:16:13,381 --> 01:16:18,135
No journey is too great,
when one finds what he seeks.

662
01:16:18,344 --> 01:16:22,765
- Does everyone in Africa talk like you?
- Why, do you not like it?

663
01:16:22,973 --> 01:16:28,687
I love it. It's nice to be with a man
who knows how to express himself.

664
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:31,649
- Thank you!
- Thank you very much!

665
01:16:31,857 --> 01:16:34,276
Let's have lunch.

666
01:16:37,613 --> 01:16:40,950
You have the most amazing effect
on people.

667
01:16:41,158 --> 01:16:46,122
- No, I don'.
- Take the guy at the basketball game.

668
01:16:46,330 --> 01:16:48,958
People love you.

669
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:54,588
I bet where you're from,
women throw themselves at your feet.

670
01:16:54,797 --> 01:17:00,302
- Why do you say that?
- You have an inner glow.

671
01:17:00,511 --> 01:17:04,640
You're above anything petty.
It's almost regal

672
01:17:08,644 --> 01:17:15,317
- What did you do back home?
- I was... in the family business.

673
01:17:16,193 --> 01:17:20,072
- What's that?
- Goat herding.

674
01:17:21,073 --> 01:17:24,160
Yes, yes. Does it surprise you?

675
01:17:24,368 --> 01:17:27,538
No, it's just that you seem so educated.

676
01:17:27,747 --> 01:17:32,918
The life of a goat herder is easy,
the goats take care of themselves.

677
01:17:33,127 --> 01:17:37,256
Which leaves a man
with a great deal of time to read.

678
01:17:40,092 --> 01:17:43,804
- Please, let me.
- No, I should pay.

679
01:17:44,013 --> 01:17:47,600
Akeem, I wish you'd stop
worrying about being poor.

680
01:17:47,808 --> 01:17:51,604
If I wanted a wealthy guy,
I'd be with Darryl

681
01:17:51,812 --> 01:17:54,148
Not you.

682
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:03,366
- Would you like to dance?
- Yes.

683
01:18:31,602 --> 01:18:34,563
What about Patrice?

684
01:18:34,772 --> 01:18:38,275
I'm not interested in Patrice.

685
01:18:39,652 --> 01:18:42,279
What about Darryl

686
01:18:42,488 --> 01:18:45,866
I'm not interested in Darryl, either.

687
01:19:11,517 --> 01:19:15,855
- Do you actually want to send this?
- Why? What is wrong?

688
01:19:16,063 --> 01:19:17,690
Read it to me.

689
01:19:17,898 --> 01:19:23,612
"To his Majesty King Jaffe Joffer,
the Royal Palace, Zamunda."

690
01:19:23,821 --> 01:19:27,950
"Sire, Akeem and I
have depleted our funds."

691
01:19:28,159 --> 01:19:32,121
"Kindly send 300,000 American dollars
immediately,"

692
01:19:32,329 --> 01:19:36,709
"as we are in dire straits.
Your humble servant, Semmi."

693
01:19:36,917 --> 01:19:39,295
Semmi.

694
01:19:39,503 --> 01:19:44,258
- Should I make it 400,000?
- Do you think that'll be enough?

695
01:19:44,467 --> 01:19:47,136
You are right. 500,000.

696
01:19:48,012 --> 01:19:51,348
As long as you're asking,
why not go for a cool million?

697
01:19:51,557 --> 01:19:55,853
- Don't you think that's too much?
- Nah.

698
01:20:02,234 --> 01:20:04,820
Okay, what's going on?

699
01:20:05,029 --> 01:20:07,490
Patrice...

700
01:20:09,492 --> 01:20:11,786
I came to see Akeem.

701
01:20:11,994 --> 01:20:16,248
What are you involved in?
You can't afford this on your salary.

702
01:20:19,168 --> 01:20:23,631
Someone to kiss
Someone to miss

703
01:20:23,839 --> 01:20:27,843
When you're away
Through here, gone each day

704
01:20:28,052 --> 01:20:33,224
To be loved, to be loved
Wow! What a feeling

705
01:20:33,432 --> 01:20:38,771
- Qu¡et! People are try¡ng to sleep.
- Some w¡sh to be a k¡ng or a queen

706
01:20:38,979 --> 01:20:41,982
- Some w¡sh for fortune and fame
- Shut up!

707
01:20:42,191 --> 01:20:47,071
But to be truly, truly, truly, truly loved

708
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:50,950
it must mean all of these things

709
01:20:52,827 --> 01:20:56,872
Someone to care
Someone to share

710
01:20:57,081 --> 01:21:01,711
Lonely hours and moments of despair

711
01:21:01,919 --> 01:21:07,800
To be loved, to be loved
Wow! What a feeling

712
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:12,555
Semmi, I just had the most wonderful...

713
01:21:14,014 --> 01:21:18,477
Hi, Akeem. Semmi told me everything.

714
01:21:19,812 --> 01:21:24,650
Sorry things didn't work out between
you and me, but you understand.

715
01:21:24,859 --> 01:21:28,487
Goodnight, sweet prince.

716
01:21:35,619 --> 01:21:38,581
Remember, you must not tell a soul

717
01:21:38,789 --> 01:21:44,003
Your secret is safe with me,
your Highness. Bye...

718
01:21:51,886 --> 01:21:54,930
If you're the prince, then who am I

719
01:21:57,975 --> 01:22:00,478
My servant.

720
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:16,786
They smell good. Darryl must be
spending a fortune on flowers.

721
01:22:16,994 --> 01:22:19,663
Stay out of this, Dad.

722
01:22:19,872 --> 01:22:23,751
- Where are you going?
- To a museum. With Akeem.

723
01:22:23,959 --> 01:22:28,089
- I don't like that one bit.
- What's wrong with Akeem?

724
01:22:29,173 --> 01:22:32,134
You told me yourself.
He's a goat herder.

725
01:22:33,427 --> 01:22:38,432
Why don't you marry Darryl
He dresses nice, he treats you good.

726
01:22:38,641 --> 01:22:42,019
You only like Darryl because he's rich.

727
01:22:43,354 --> 01:22:47,650
I don't want you to have to struggle
like your mother and I did.

728
01:22:47,858 --> 01:22:51,278
I know. Bye, Daddy.

729
01:22:58,285 --> 01:23:00,496
Come in.

730
01:23:02,748 --> 01:23:07,545
- You boys wanted to see me.
- We would like to change apartments.

731
01:23:09,296 --> 01:23:12,091
Goddamn! What the hell
have you done in here?

732
01:23:12,299 --> 01:23:16,846
My friend Semmi has altered the
apartment, so we would like to change.

733
01:23:17,054 --> 01:23:18,723
This stuff ain't hot, is it?

734
01:23:18,931 --> 01:23:25,020
No, but I'm bringing a young lady up,
and she can't see me living like this.

735
01:23:26,647 --> 01:23:32,737
I'll let you boys stay in my apartment
and I'll move up here.

736
01:23:32,945 --> 01:23:38,284
- Does your apartment look poor?
- It's a real shithole. You'll love it.

737
01:23:39,577 --> 01:23:45,166
Here are the keys. It's apartment 1 A.
Downstairs. First floor.

738
01:23:45,374 --> 01:23:49,211
Thank you, you're too kind.
Semmi, move our things.

739
01:23:57,261 --> 01:24:00,556
I have a date with Lisa.
Isn't that wonderful

740
01:25:19,427 --> 01:25:22,722
Who in the hell is that?

741
01:25:32,982 --> 01:25:39,113
What's up, brother? You're a little late
for the Christmas pageant.

742
01:25:43,075 --> 01:25:45,995
I'm King Jaffe Joffer, ruler of Zamunda.

743
01:25:46,203 --> 01:25:50,332
Have a seat. Chair number two
will be ready in a second.

744
01:25:53,669 --> 01:25:56,547
This is beautiful What is that - velvet?

745
01:25:58,716 --> 01:26:00,926
I have come for my son Akeem.

746
01:26:01,135 --> 01:26:05,973
- Who?
- You know, Kunta.

747
01:26:06,182 --> 01:26:12,396
- The boy upstairs.
- He live upstairs on the fifth floor.

748
01:26:14,815 --> 01:26:17,902
Who's going to clean up the flowers?

749
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,955
You may enter.

750
01:26:36,754 --> 01:26:40,633
- You are not Akeem.
- I know that.

751
01:26:49,183 --> 01:26:52,561
- What is this?
- A photograph.

752
01:26:52,770 --> 01:26:54,855
What is this "McDowell's"?

753
01:26:55,064 --> 01:27:00,236
It's a place over on Queens Boulevard.
I think he works there.

754
01:27:00,444 --> 01:27:03,364
My son works?!

755
01:27:03,572 --> 01:27:09,161
- Where is he now?
- He moved to apartment 1 A.

756
01:27:20,381 --> 01:27:23,801
Your Majesty.
What are you doing here?

757
01:27:24,009 --> 01:27:27,096
I received your telegram.
Where is Akeem?

758
01:27:28,514 --> 01:27:32,393
He went out. How was your flight?
Comfortable, I trust.

759
01:27:32,601 --> 01:27:37,565
Yourjob was to look after Akeem.
How could you let this happen?

760
01:27:37,773 --> 01:27:41,402
Akeem will not listen to me,
he's gone quite mad.

761
01:27:43,029 --> 01:27:44,864
Semmi...

762
01:27:45,072 --> 01:27:49,827
You've disgraced yourself,
and you must be punished.

763
01:27:50,786 --> 01:27:55,958
You will confine yourself to our
royal suite at the Waldorf-Astoria.

764
01:27:56,167 --> 01:28:01,297
See that he puts on some decent attire.
And bathe him thoroughly.

765
01:28:07,094 --> 01:28:09,513
Thank you, your Majesty!

766
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:15,770
Look, Zamunda!
That's where you're from, isn't it?

767
01:28:15,978 --> 01:28:19,648
- What's it like?
- It's the most beautiful place on earth.

768
01:28:19,857 --> 01:28:26,155
The people are very friendly, and you...
You, they would treat like a queen.

769
01:28:31,786 --> 01:28:34,622
People will see us.

770
01:28:35,247 --> 01:28:37,958
Then let them see. Lisa...

771
01:28:38,167 --> 01:28:40,252
- Let us go.
- Now?

772
01:28:40,461 --> 01:28:43,297
Yes. Right now.

773
01:28:59,313 --> 01:29:05,111
Darryl, come by the house tonight.
About 9 p.m.

774
01:29:05,986 --> 01:29:08,614
Lisa will be home by then.

775
01:29:08,823 --> 01:29:12,118
Don't worry about it,
we'll work something out.

776
01:29:12,326 --> 01:29:14,912
Okay, see you later.

777
01:29:20,626 --> 01:29:25,005
There's some people here to see you.

778
01:29:26,799 --> 01:29:30,136
- Are they from McDonald's?
- I don't think so.

779
01:29:37,184 --> 01:29:39,812
What can I do for you?

780
01:29:42,857 --> 01:29:45,443
This is King Jaffe Joffer,
ruler of Zamunda.

781
01:29:45,651 --> 01:29:49,947
- He's searching for his son Akeem.
- Your son?

782
01:29:50,156 --> 01:29:54,201
- Yes, my son, the Prince.
- Prince? Are you serious?

783
01:29:54,410 --> 01:29:57,246
Prince Akeem is the sole heir
to the throne of Zamunda.

784
01:29:57,455 --> 01:30:00,583
I knew there was something special
about that boy.

785
01:30:00,791 --> 01:30:05,796
- Can you tell us where he might be?
- He's out with my lovely daughter Lisa.

786
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:11,719
I'm staying at the Waldorf-Astoria.
When you see him, call me.

787
01:30:11,927 --> 01:30:14,180
- I'll tell him you're here.
- No.

788
01:30:14,388 --> 01:30:19,101
Do not alert him to my presence.
I shall deal with him myself.

789
01:30:24,982 --> 01:30:29,987
- For your trouble.
- Thank you, your Royalness.

790
01:30:40,498 --> 01:30:42,041
A prince!

791
01:31:04,397 --> 01:31:07,191
Wait! We cannot go in.

792
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:09,318
Why not?

793
01:31:09,527 --> 01:31:12,613
Wait in the car. I will be right back.

794
01:31:22,748 --> 01:31:25,084
- We must leave.
- I don't care about the apartment.

795
01:31:25,292 --> 01:31:28,003
It's not that. I feel like I'm rushing you.

796
01:31:28,212 --> 01:31:30,297
No, you're not.

797
01:31:31,173 --> 01:31:34,844
- It's better if we take our time.
- But I want to.

798
01:31:35,052 --> 01:31:37,972
It's better if I take you home.

799
01:31:44,353 --> 01:31:49,191
Look who's here!
Akeem, it's good to see you.

800
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:52,319
- It's good to see you, too.
- Have a drink.

801
01:31:52,528 --> 01:31:57,116
- I have to get going, Mr McDowell.
- You have time for one drink.

802
01:31:57,324 --> 01:31:58,993
Get out of here, dog.

803
01:31:59,201 --> 01:32:01,454
We don't spend enough time talking.

804
01:32:01,662 --> 01:32:04,248
Perhaps some other time,
I have to get going.

805
01:32:04,457 --> 01:32:08,002
Sit down,
I'll be right back with that drink.

806
01:32:25,519 --> 01:32:28,439
King Jaffe Joffer's room, please.

807
01:32:30,608 --> 01:32:33,527
Hello, King. Cleo McDowell here.

808
01:32:33,736 --> 01:32:36,906
Both the kids are here, together.

809
01:32:37,114 --> 01:32:42,870
2432 Derby Avenue,
Jamaica Estates. Right.

810
01:32:43,079 --> 01:32:46,791
King, I was wondering if... Hello, King?

811
01:32:50,419 --> 01:32:53,714
- I really have to go, sir.
- No. Have a seat right here.

812
01:32:53,923 --> 01:32:56,425
Did you want ice in that?

813
01:32:56,634 --> 01:32:59,053
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

814
01:33:10,648 --> 01:33:13,776
- Who was that?
- Jehovah's Witness.

815
01:33:15,194 --> 01:33:16,946
Excuse me.

816
01:33:23,202 --> 01:33:27,039
She doesn't like you anymore.
Get that through your greasy head!

817
01:33:27,248 --> 01:33:29,917
But you told me to come over.

818
01:33:32,628 --> 01:33:34,588
Now, where were we?

819
01:33:50,104 --> 01:33:52,815
I warned you, didn't I? Dottie, get him!

820
01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:05,619
I appreciate your hospitality,
but I have to get going.

821
01:34:05,828 --> 01:34:07,788
You can stay a little while longer.

822
01:34:07,997 --> 01:34:12,001
I just put some delicious hors d'oeuvres
in the oven... son.

823
01:34:13,085 --> 01:34:15,337
Let me go see if they're ready.

824
01:34:18,883 --> 01:34:21,927
- Lisa, I must leave.
- Is something wrong, Akeem?

825
01:34:23,012 --> 01:34:25,598
I'll tell you when the time is right,
but now I must go.

826
01:34:25,806 --> 01:34:28,809
Tell your father goodbye for me.

827
01:34:32,355 --> 01:34:34,648
- Where's Akeem?
- He had to leave.

828
01:34:34,857 --> 01:34:38,778
- He can't leave!
- What is going on?

829
01:34:38,986 --> 01:34:42,490
And why are you so nice to Akeem
all of a sudden?

830
01:34:42,698 --> 01:34:45,201
I like the boy.

831
01:34:45,409 --> 01:34:48,621
- What are you up to?
- What? Nothing.

832
01:34:48,829 --> 01:34:51,290
A man's got a right
to change his mind.

833
01:34:51,499 --> 01:34:55,836
- Daddy...
- You two make a beautiful couple.

834
01:34:56,045 --> 01:34:59,673
- Daddy...
- He's a real fine young man.

835
01:34:59,882 --> 01:35:06,013
- Dad!
- Okay, Lisa. He's rich. He is rich!

836
01:35:06,222 --> 01:35:08,849
- What?
- He's got his own money.

837
01:35:09,058 --> 01:35:14,855
When I tell you he's got his own money,
I mean the boy has got his own money.

838
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:25,408
A prince. He's a prince!

839
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:31,247
Lisa, you did it this time.
You hit the jackpot!

840
01:35:31,455 --> 01:35:35,292
Your goat herder makes Darryl
look like a welfare case.

841
01:35:49,014 --> 01:35:51,475
I will get out here.

842
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,730
That'll be nine bucks.

843
01:36:17,752 --> 01:36:20,838
Good news, Akeem.
We've been rescued.

844
01:36:21,047 --> 01:36:26,010
- Where are my parents?
- They've gone to the McDowell's.

845
01:36:26,218 --> 01:36:28,345
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

846
01:36:28,554 --> 01:36:30,473
Back to Queens.

847
01:36:31,849 --> 01:36:35,311
Look who's here! Come in, come in.

848
01:36:35,519 --> 01:36:38,314
Welcome to Casa de McDowell's.
Come right in.

849
01:36:48,324 --> 01:36:51,202
- Where is Akeem?
- He just stepped out.

850
01:36:51,410 --> 01:36:55,498
Probably went for a pizza.
You know these youngsters.

851
01:36:55,706 --> 01:36:59,418
This must be your lovely wife.
How are you today?

852
01:36:59,627 --> 01:37:01,587
Very well, thank you.

853
01:37:01,796 --> 01:37:06,592
I don't know whether to shake
your hand, kiss it or bow or what.

854
01:37:06,801 --> 01:37:10,012
I feel like break dancing.

855
01:37:10,221 --> 01:37:16,060
Come in, have a seat, take a load off.
Your son ought to be back in a minute.

856
01:37:16,268 --> 01:37:19,980
- Try the Lazy-Boy. It's comfortable.
- It's very nice.

857
01:37:20,189 --> 01:37:21,982
Put your feet up.

858
01:37:29,657 --> 01:37:32,368
Here you go, King.
Try one of these pigs in a blanket.

859
01:37:32,576 --> 01:37:34,787
They're the frozen kind,
but you'd never know it.

860
01:37:34,995 --> 01:37:37,832
You told me my son was here.

861
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:42,670
My daughter Lisa might know where
he went. They've gotten quite close.

862
01:37:42,878 --> 01:37:45,840
Where is your daughter?
I must speak to her at once.

863
01:37:46,424 --> 01:37:49,260
Lisa?
There's someone here to see you.

864
01:37:55,474 --> 01:37:58,894
This is Akeem's father. The King!

865
01:37:59,103 --> 01:38:01,147
Leave us.

866
01:38:10,197 --> 01:38:13,868
- I understand you're seeing my son.
- I was seeing him.

867
01:38:14,076 --> 01:38:16,120
So you know about his wife
in Zamunda?

868
01:38:16,328 --> 01:38:18,789
- He's married?
- No, but he will be soon.

869
01:38:18,998 --> 01:38:22,918
We've already chosen his bride.
So you see...

870
01:38:23,127 --> 01:38:25,671
...he cannot be serious about you.

871
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:30,176
Akeem came to America to...
sow his royal oats.

872
01:38:31,635 --> 01:38:34,055
Excuse me, I need to be alone.

873
01:38:34,263 --> 01:38:38,601
Are you comfortable, Miss...
I'm not sure what to call you.

874
01:38:38,809 --> 01:38:43,981
- My name is Cleo.
- Nice to meet you. My name's Aoleon.

875
01:38:44,190 --> 01:38:46,859
Aoleon. Aeolon...

876
01:38:50,363 --> 01:38:55,701
Lisa, where are you going?
I want you to meet the Queen.

877
01:38:55,910 --> 01:39:01,916
- Are you all right, my dear?
- I'm sorry. I have to get out of here.

878
01:39:02,124 --> 01:39:04,752
What's the matter, baby?

879
01:39:09,965 --> 01:39:12,134
What did you say to my daughter?

880
01:39:12,343 --> 01:39:16,055
The truth. That Akeem
could not be interested in her.

881
01:39:16,263 --> 01:39:21,227
- How can you be so sure?
- Our son can't consort with such a girl

882
01:39:21,435 --> 01:39:23,938
Now, wait a minute!

883
01:39:25,147 --> 01:39:26,565
Oha...

884
01:39:29,902 --> 01:39:33,989
You have been inconvenienced,
and I'm prepared to compensate you.

885
01:39:34,198 --> 01:39:37,451
- Shall we say 1 million dollars?
- No way.

886
01:39:37,660 --> 01:39:41,122
- 2 million.
- You can't buy my daughter off.

887
01:39:41,330 --> 01:39:44,875
- Nonsense!
- Jaffe, apologise to Mr McDowell.

888
01:39:45,084 --> 01:39:48,629
I will not. The man is beneath me,
and so is his daughter.

889
01:39:48,838 --> 01:39:52,258
I don't give a damn who you are.
This is America, Jack.

890
01:39:52,466 --> 01:39:57,555
You say one more word about Lisa,
and I'll break my foot off in your ass.

891
01:39:58,931 --> 01:40:02,643
- Pardon me?
- What's everybody yelling about?

892
01:40:02,852 --> 01:40:06,897
Their son, the Prince, loves your sister,
but the King can't handle it.

893
01:40:07,106 --> 01:40:10,526
No, he's not.
The Prince is in love with me.

894
01:40:15,948 --> 01:40:19,118
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Mother. I'm fine.

895
01:40:19,326 --> 01:40:22,329
Why are you hugging him?
He's just the servant.

896
01:40:23,664 --> 01:40:27,001
He's the Prince.

897
01:40:28,419 --> 01:40:30,963
Who told you that?

898
01:40:37,303 --> 01:40:41,348
- You mean Akeem's the Prince?
- Yeah, and he's in love with Lisa.

899
01:40:41,557 --> 01:40:44,727
How come she always gets
the good ones?

900
01:40:47,605 --> 01:40:51,442
- Where is Lisa?
- Your daddy ran her off.

901
01:40:55,488 --> 01:40:58,491
- What did you tell her?
- It is of no consequence.

902
01:40:58,699 --> 01:41:03,162
- We shall return to Zamunda at once.
- I will not leave without Lisa.

903
01:41:03,371 --> 01:41:06,248
So you do care for her?

904
01:41:07,917 --> 01:41:10,878
Mother, I love her.

905
01:41:11,087 --> 01:41:13,714
Then go after her.

906
01:41:18,344 --> 01:41:23,349
- Akeem! I forbid you.
- Put a sock in it, Jaffe. The boy's in love.

907
01:41:49,792 --> 01:41:52,253
Darryl, what happened?

908
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:58,759
- Lisa dumped me.
- I know. You poor thing.

909
01:42:00,803 --> 01:42:06,225
The first thing we have to do
is get you out of these wet clothes.

910
01:42:08,602 --> 01:42:10,563
Stop!

911
01:42:10,771 --> 01:42:12,732
Lisa!

912
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:14,483
Lisa!

913
01:42:19,780 --> 01:42:22,033
I will be fine by myself.

914
01:43:12,875 --> 01:43:15,086
Lisa, please.

915
01:43:16,003 --> 01:43:19,090
I did not mean to hurt you.

916
01:43:19,298 --> 01:43:23,135
Well, at least I know
who gave me these.

917
01:43:23,344 --> 01:43:26,889
You can keep them,
'cause I don't want them...

918
01:43:27,098 --> 01:43:29,725
...and I don't want you.

919
01:43:46,492 --> 01:43:48,077
Just leave me alone!

920
01:43:48,285 --> 01:43:51,455
Lisa, please. I love you.

921
01:43:51,664 --> 01:43:53,999
What about the woman
you are supposed to marry?

922
01:43:54,208 --> 01:43:57,128
I don't love her.
Why do you think I came here?

923
01:43:57,336 --> 01:44:00,381
Your father told me -
to sow your royal oats.

924
01:44:00,589 --> 01:44:06,137
I came to America to find my bride.
I came to Queens to find you.

925
01:44:06,345 --> 01:44:10,516
So why did you lie to me? Why didn'
you just tell me you were a prince?

926
01:44:10,725 --> 01:44:14,186
I wanted you to love me for who I am.

927
01:44:14,395 --> 01:44:18,315
- I'm not sure who are.
- I'm the man you fell in love with.

928
01:44:18,524 --> 01:44:21,360
Should it matter that I am a prince?

929
01:44:24,280 --> 01:44:25,614
It shouldn', but I...

930
01:44:25,823 --> 01:44:31,287
Say you never loved me,
and I won't bother you again.

931
01:44:38,461 --> 01:44:41,756
It just wouldn't work out,
we're too different.

932
01:44:41,964 --> 01:44:44,425
You're royalty, for God's sake.

933
01:44:44,633 --> 01:44:46,594
Do you want me
to renounce my throne? I will.

934
01:44:46,802 --> 01:44:51,140
I renounce my throne. I am no longer
the Prince of Zamunda.

935
01:44:51,349 --> 01:44:53,601
I renounce my throne!

936
01:44:58,064 --> 01:45:00,941
Does this make you happy?

937
01:45:09,784 --> 01:45:13,204
I can't let you do that.

938
01:45:13,412 --> 01:45:16,290
I do not care about my crown.

939
01:45:16,499 --> 01:45:19,502
All I care about is you.

940
01:45:19,710 --> 01:45:22,338
Marry me, Lisa.

941
01:45:26,884 --> 01:45:32,431
- So, what do you think?
- Go on, honey. Take a chance.

942
01:45:45,444 --> 01:45:50,491
Look, I'm sorry. I can'.
Goodbye, Akeem.

943
01:45:57,873 --> 01:46:01,544
If you're really a prince, I'll marry you.

944
01:47:18,412 --> 01:47:23,459
Look at it this way. At least we learned
how to make French fries.

945
01:47:49,902 --> 01:47:52,863
You're still not speaking to me.

946
01:47:53,906 --> 01:47:57,284
- I only want our son to be happy.
- And so do I.

947
01:47:57,493 --> 01:48:00,955
Aoleon, please. It is out of our hands.
The girl told him no.

948
01:48:01,163 --> 01:48:04,417
After the way you treated her,
who could blame her?

949
01:48:04,625 --> 01:48:08,921
Even if she said yes, they still couldn'
marry. It's against the tradition.

950
01:48:09,130 --> 01:48:11,757
Well, it is a stupid tradition.

951
01:48:12,508 --> 01:48:16,804
- Who am I to change it?
- I thought you were the King.

952
01:49:40,554 --> 01:49:45,851
Your Highness.
We have not come to that part yet.

953
01:49:53,484 --> 01:49:57,530
Your Highness. Your Highness!

954
01:50:25,433 --> 01:50:27,935
Would you really
have given this up for me?

955
01:50:28,144 --> 01:50:31,647
Of course. If you like,
we can give it all up now.

956
01:50:34,692 --> 01:50:36,277
Nah!

957
01:51:45,179 --> 01:51:48,140
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Stop right there.

958
01:51:48,349 --> 01:51:50,935
Listen! Stop right there a minute.

959
01:51:51,143 --> 01:51:53,979
A man goes in to a restaurant.
Are you listening?

960
01:51:54,188 --> 01:51:58,693
A man goes into a restaurant.
He sits down and has a bowl of soup.

961
01:51:58,901 --> 01:52:01,612
He says to the waiter,
"Come, taste the soup".

962
01:52:01,821 --> 01:52:04,657
The waiter says, "Is there something
wrong with the soup?" "Taste the soup."

963
01:52:04,865 --> 01:52:07,910
"Is the soup too hot?"
"Will you taste the soup?"

964
01:52:08,119 --> 01:52:10,996
"Is the soup too cold?"
"Will you just taste the soup!"

965
01:52:11,205 --> 01:52:14,333
"All right, I'll taste the soup.
Where's the spoon?"

966
01:52:21,507 --> 01:52:24,218
What do you know from funny,
you bastard?

967
01:56:39,724 --> 01:56:41,767
ENGLISH
