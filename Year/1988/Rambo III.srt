1
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,630
John!

2
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,648
John Rambo!

3
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:49,459
I don't believe this!

4
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,060
- So where you're coming from?
- Washington.

5
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:02,157
- Good to see you again!
- Yeah, you too.

6
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:05,960
Do you want to tell me about it?

7
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:08,141
About what?

8
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:12,118
About yesterday, I've seen you stick
fighting in a warehouse in Bangkok.

9
00:08:12,562 --> 00:08:14,713
- You saw that?
- Yeah.

10
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:18,057
And today I find you,
working in a monastery.

11
00:08:19,003 --> 00:08:21,862
They let me live here and
I help out, fixing things.

12
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,380
And the stick fighting?

13
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:25,758
I just do that for their lack of money.

14
00:08:28,243 --> 00:08:30,599
Yeah... I saw you give it to the monks.

15
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:32,232
You see a lot.

16
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:36,882
Colonel, who are they?

17
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:38,720
They're part of the reason I'm here.

18
00:08:41,364 --> 00:08:44,342
This is Robert Griggs, he's a
field officer of our local embassy.

19
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:45,753
John Rambo.

20
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:47,957
Pleasure.

21
00:08:48,724 --> 00:08:50,164
Well, you're sure not easy to find!

22
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:51,804
Why are you keepin' track?

23
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,796
Well, like the Colonel says,
good men are hard to find!

24
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:02,015
John, I'd like you to take a
look at some of these photos.

25
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:04,837
I don't know how much you
know about Afghanistan.

26
00:09:05,287 --> 00:09:07,847
Most people can't even find it on a map!

27
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:10,401
But over two million civilians,

28
00:09:10,796 --> 00:09:12,895
mostly peasants
farmers and their families,

29
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:16,596
have been systematically
slaughtered by invading Russian armies.

30
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:19,162
Every new weapon,

31
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:25,039
including chemical warfare, has
been used to eliminate these people.

32
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:27,944
And they've been very
successful, at many levels.

33
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:32,843
I assume that you're out of touch
with the current states of the war.

34
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,205
But after nine years of fighting,

35
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:38,066
the Afghan Forces are now
getting their Stinger missiles,

36
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:40,483
and are now beginning to hold
their own against the Air-Strikes.

37
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:44,365
Except for one region,
50 miles over the border.

38
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:48,421
Apparently, the Soviet Commander
there is exceptionally brutal,

39
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:50,161
as those photos indicate.

40
00:09:50,609 --> 00:09:53,663
And he's managed to string
allow all aid from the outside.

41
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:56,961
So we want to...

42
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,844
investigate the problem firsthand.

43
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:02,862
And what that's got to do with me?

44
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:06,368
They've asked me to go in.

45
00:10:07,269 --> 00:10:08,367
You're not gonna do it?

46
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,967
Yes. And I want you to
come with me, John.

47
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:13,906
I put in my time.

48
00:10:14,408 --> 00:10:15,484
What does that mean?

49
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:18,485
It means my war is over.

50
00:10:29,051 --> 00:10:32,030
I thought you said he
was this great soldier.

51
00:10:32,973 --> 00:10:34,292
Well, Colonel...

52
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:37,366
that's like we've got a
long walk down those stairs.

53
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:56,370
Don't be tough on him,
he's just following orders.

54
00:10:57,613 --> 00:10:59,569
This mission's important, John.

55
00:11:00,414 --> 00:11:01,750
Do you really think we
can make a difference?

56
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,387
If I didn't, I wouldn't be going.

57
00:11:03,533 --> 00:11:06,369
- It didn't before.
- That was another time.

58
00:11:07,814 --> 00:11:09,373
Come with me, John.

59
00:11:14,176 --> 00:11:17,849
I don't know what you think
about this place, but I like it.

60
00:11:18,295 --> 00:11:22,769
I like bein' here, I like workin'
here. I like belong into something.

61
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,376
You DO belong into something. Not this.

62
00:11:26,857 --> 00:11:28,349
When you're gonna come full circle?

63
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,144
What are you talkin' about?

64
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:34,453
You said that your war is over.
I think the one out there is,

65
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:36,852
but not the one inside you.

66
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:40,368
I know the reasons you're here, John.
But it doesn't work that way.

67
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:44,687
You may try, but you can't get
away from what you really are.

68
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:45,970
And what is it I am?

69
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:47,504
A full-blooded combat soldier.

70
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:49,853
Not any more. I dont want it.

71
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:52,048
That's too bad, 'cause
you're stuck with it.

72
00:11:52,698 --> 00:11:54,096
Let me tell you a story, John.

73
00:11:54,537 --> 00:11:58,417
There was a sculptor and he
found a stone, a special stone.

74
00:11:58,858 --> 00:12:00,775
He dragged it home and he
worked on it for months,

75
00:12:00,776 --> 00:12:02,392
until he finally finished.

76
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,097
When he was ready, he
showed it to his friends,

77
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,098
and they said he had
created a great statue.

78
00:12:07,577 --> 00:12:09,414
The sculptor said he
hadn't created anything.

79
00:12:09,415 --> 00:12:11,650
The statue was always there.

80
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,590
He just cleared away to small pieces.

81
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:18,098
We didn't make you
this fighting machine.

82
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:21,728
We just shifted away the rough edges.

83
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:24,305
Your own is gonna be
tearing away with yourself,

84
00:12:24,306 --> 00:12:26,430
until you come to terms
with what you are!

85
00:12:27,261 --> 00:12:28,933
Until you come full circle.

86
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,695
I guess I'm not ready yet.

87
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,813
Well, I got to move.

88
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:46,416
Promise me you'll look me
when you're next in the States.

89
00:12:47,221 --> 00:12:48,370
I promise.

90
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,221
Colonel!

91
00:12:50,902 --> 00:12:54,372
I'm sorry. But it's gotta
end for me sometime.

92
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,244
I understand.

93
00:14:18,848 --> 00:14:20,300
Take cover!

94
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,362
Drop your weapons and
remain where you are!

95
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,387
You cannot escape!

96
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:57,342
Drop your weapons!

97
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,348
You have no chance of escape!

98
00:15:01,431 --> 00:15:03,102
Drop your weapons!

99
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,546
Now!

100
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:30,447
Rambo!

101
00:15:32,452 --> 00:15:33,801
Something went wrong.

102
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:34,988
What happened?

103
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:37,726
Soviets intercepted the
team, just over the border.

104
00:15:39,434 --> 00:15:42,072
Among we've gathered,
Trautman and the rest of his party

105
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:44,312
have been taken to the
regional commandment post.

106
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,461
And what are you doing about it?

107
00:15:47,954 --> 00:15:49,393
I can't do anything about it.

108
00:15:49,994 --> 00:15:51,094
I'm sorry.

109
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:53,721
I just thought you should know.

110
00:15:55,514 --> 00:15:56,763
What about me?

111
00:15:59,113 --> 00:16:00,308
About you?

112
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:01,902
Can you get me in?

113
00:16:02,354 --> 00:16:03,530
You're not serious.

114
00:16:03,731 --> 00:16:05,108
Oh yeah, I'm serious.

115
00:16:07,714 --> 00:16:08,954
It can't be done officially.

116
00:16:08,955 --> 00:16:10,493
Make it unofficial.

117
00:16:11,835 --> 00:16:15,034
If it can be done, I want you to
know upfront of your capture,

118
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:16,909
or any of this leaks,

119
00:16:17,355 --> 00:16:21,146
we'll deny any participation, or
even knowledge of your existence.

120
00:16:22,596 --> 00:16:23,949
I'm used to it.

121
00:16:25,476 --> 00:16:26,795
We'll get back.

122
00:17:48,482 --> 00:17:51,537
You want to buy? Many guns here!

123
00:17:51,842 --> 00:17:54,477
No. I'm looking for Mousa Chanin.

124
00:17:55,363 --> 00:17:58,400
- What's your name?
- John Rambo.

125
00:18:01,243 --> 00:18:02,391
Wait here.

126
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:25,513
They sell many in Afghanistan.

127
00:18:28,164 --> 00:18:29,562
Many landmines.

128
00:18:30,004 --> 00:18:31,403
Landmines everywhere.

129
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,642
I am Mousa Chanin.
What is it you want?

130
00:18:35,742 --> 00:18:37,040
I was sent by Griggs.

131
00:18:38,605 --> 00:18:41,000
You do not look like
men Griggs sent before.

132
00:18:41,102 --> 00:18:43,395
You not look like you are with military.

133
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,382
I'm not.

134
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,200
What you are? A mercenary?

135
00:18:48,887 --> 00:18:50,263
No.

136
00:18:50,365 --> 00:18:51,953
You're not a military, you're
not a mercenary, what are you?

137
00:18:52,453 --> 00:18:53,741
Lost tourist?

138
00:18:59,687 --> 00:19:01,403
I'm not a tourist.

139
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:04,123
Sorry.

140
00:19:04,224 --> 00:19:05,781
Do you know where the American is?

141
00:19:05,927 --> 00:19:08,401
Yes. In a Soviet fort.

142
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:12,238
Near the village of Khost,
30 miles over the border.

143
00:19:12,688 --> 00:19:15,348
Mr. Griggs sent you the
supplies you asked for.

144
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:17,006
You wish to see them now?

145
00:19:17,408 --> 00:19:18,307
Yeah.

146
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:22,342
Is this what you asked for?

147
00:19:23,043 --> 00:19:23,997
Yeah.

148
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:26,918
Never seen these things
before. What are these?

149
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:29,803
- Detonators.
- And this?

150
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:32,078
What is this for?

151
00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:34,746
It's blue light.

152
00:19:34,747 --> 00:19:36,123
What does it do?

153
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,646
It turns blue.

154
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:40,605
I see.

155
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:43,267
Can you tell me how many
more men come with us?

156
00:19:43,409 --> 00:19:45,320
There's no rescue team. There's just me.

157
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,847
Just you? Come on, this is no good!

158
00:19:47,948 --> 00:19:49,848
I can not take only one man to the fort.

159
00:19:49,849 --> 00:19:51,749
You need more men to help.

160
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:54,844
Griggs said you'd take
me there. Take me there!

161
00:19:55,451 --> 00:19:57,344
I am meant to take medical supplies,

162
00:19:57,345 --> 00:19:59,538
if I not take it, many people will die.

163
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:01,010
Do you understand?

164
00:20:02,532 --> 00:20:04,409
Well, I do not know who you really are,

165
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:07,908
but by the way you look, I can see
you have no experience in war. Do you?

166
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:10,439
Come on, do you?

167
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,502
I've fired a few shots.

168
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:18,422
A few shots?

169
00:20:19,372 --> 00:20:21,969
Come on, maybe you should go back home,

170
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,566
and think it all over again.

171
00:20:23,812 --> 00:20:25,068
For a very long time.

172
00:20:29,292 --> 00:20:31,045
I did think it over.

173
00:20:32,212 --> 00:20:34,089
You did?

174
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:37,163
Well, this is your choice.

175
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:40,890
But let me tell you, you can
not get this American alone.

176
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:44,494
If you fail, do not blame me.

177
00:20:44,933 --> 00:20:46,613
I will accept no responsibility.

178
00:20:49,093 --> 00:20:50,550
Sounds familiar.

179
00:21:23,815 --> 00:21:27,774
My name is Colonel Zaysen,
Regional Commander of this sector.

180
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:35,616
You're here as the first
American captured in Afghanistan.

181
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,009
Congratulations.

182
00:21:39,537 --> 00:21:42,328
I believe you're planning to
supply enemy rebels forces

183
00:21:42,378 --> 00:21:46,153
with Stinger missiles, intending
to destroy Soviet aircraft.

184
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:48,058
If I'm gonna be interrogated,

185
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,698
I wanna be interrogated
by your superiors.

186
00:21:52,617 --> 00:21:55,416
Out here, I have no superiors.

187
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:58,607
I am in full command.

188
00:22:00,699 --> 00:22:02,513
You're alone here.

189
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,771
Abandoned by your government.

190
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:13,854
- What do you want?
- Cooperation.

191
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,717
This sector has been under
total control for over five years.

192
00:22:22,421 --> 00:22:25,015
There's little more I can do here.

193
00:22:25,702 --> 00:22:29,709
It is, as you say, without challenges.

194
00:22:32,902 --> 00:22:35,041
If you supply to me
worth information about most

195
00:22:35,042 --> 00:22:37,380
stinger missiles
you're planning to deliver,

196
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:40,281
it could provide a way
out of this further post.

197
00:22:41,462 --> 00:22:45,012
After all, the end what
everyone really wants...

198
00:22:46,981 --> 00:22:48,098
...is peace.

199
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:50,454
The Kremlin's got a hell
of a sense of humor.

200
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:53,138
Please explain.

201
00:22:53,623 --> 00:22:56,080
You talk peace and
disarmament to the world,

202
00:22:56,081 --> 00:22:58,539
and here you are, wiping
out a race of people.

203
00:22:58,983 --> 00:23:01,861
We are wiping out no one.

204
00:23:02,463 --> 00:23:06,694
I think you're too intelligent
to believe such a propaganda!

205
00:23:07,823 --> 00:23:09,895
Now again: where are the missiles?

206
00:23:09,944 --> 00:23:11,400
I don't know anything
about any missiles!

207
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:12,856
Of course you do!

208
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:16,444
But you do not seem to realize
I'm providing a way out for us both.

209
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:18,340
You expect sympathy?

210
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:21,301
You started this damn war,
now you have to deal with it!

211
00:23:21,544 --> 00:23:25,764
And we will. It is just a matter of time
before we achieve a complete victory.

212
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:27,134
You know there won't be a victory.

213
00:23:27,763 --> 00:23:30,819
Everyday, your war machines lose
ground to a bunch of poorly armed,

214
00:23:31,264 --> 00:23:32,817
poorly equiped freedom-fighters!

215
00:23:33,065 --> 00:23:35,660
The fact is that you
underestimated your competition.

216
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:37,470
If you studied your History,

217
00:23:37,471 --> 00:23:39,119
you'd know this people
never gave up to anyone.

218
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:43,061
They'd rather die than be
slaves to an invading army.

219
00:23:43,306 --> 00:23:44,983
You can't defeat a people like that.

220
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:48,525
We tried. We already had our Vietnam!

221
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:51,501
Now you're gonna have yours!

222
00:23:51,546 --> 00:23:55,180
So, you wish to test me. Good.

223
00:24:32,989 --> 00:24:34,344
This is Afghanistan.

224
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,946
Alexander the Great tried
to conquer this country,

225
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:42,118
then Ghenghis Khan, then
the British, now Russia.

226
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,789
But Afghan people fight
hard, they never be defeated.

227
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,367
Ancient enemy make prayer about
these people. Do you wish to hear?

228
00:24:51,592 --> 00:24:54,230
Very good. It says:

229
00:24:54,671 --> 00:24:56,822
"May God deliver us from
the venom of the cobra,

230
00:24:57,271 --> 00:25:00,467
teeth of the tiger, and the
vengeance of the Afghans. "

231
00:25:02,391 --> 00:25:03,744
Understand what this means?

232
00:25:05,472 --> 00:25:08,351
That you guys don't take any shit.

233
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:11,427
Yes, something like this.

234
00:25:16,231 --> 00:25:17,142
We go now!

235
00:25:50,753 --> 00:25:53,508
In the north, there are many
caves, we'll travel through them.

236
00:25:54,274 --> 00:25:56,232
It'll be safer. We go!

237
00:26:00,636 --> 00:26:02,910
This cave leads to the
"Valley of the Five Lions".

238
00:26:03,515 --> 00:26:08,032
The Afghan King was asked to send
500 of his warriors into battle.

239
00:26:08,476 --> 00:26:10,033
He sent only five.

240
00:26:12,795 --> 00:26:15,469
His greatest five, and they won.

241
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:18,874
He said, it's better to send
five lions than 500 sheep.

242
00:26:19,316 --> 00:26:22,356
- What do you think of this?
- I think the King was lucky.

243
00:26:24,517 --> 00:26:27,986
- How much longer till the village?
- About two hours.

244
00:26:38,718 --> 00:26:41,835
Where in my sector are the
missiles being delivered?

245
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:46,913
I don't know.

246
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:49,232
You liar.

247
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:53,234
Where?

248
00:26:56,798 --> 00:26:57,993
Where?

249
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,277
OK, I'll tell ya.

250
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,720
I knew you were lying.

251
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,732
Now, where are the missiles located?

252
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,749
Close.

253
00:27:12,442 --> 00:27:13,510
How close?

254
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:16,869
In your ass!

255
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:32,239
You've tried my patience long enough.

256
00:27:39,664 --> 00:27:41,938
I tried to be civilian.

257
00:28:12,784 --> 00:28:14,297
The name John Rambo...

258
00:28:19,105 --> 00:28:20,943
...do you know it?

259
00:28:22,624 --> 00:28:23,580
No?

260
00:28:24,824 --> 00:28:27,122
He says that there's a
plan for a rescue attempt

261
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:29,422
with the help of some of the rebels.

262
00:28:30,146 --> 00:28:32,741
He also says he knows
where this man is going.

263
00:28:37,545 --> 00:28:38,739
We will welcome him.

264
00:28:56,907 --> 00:29:00,344
It's the last village in the
valley. About 200 man here.

265
00:29:02,548 --> 00:29:04,168
There's a lot of lot of kids in.

266
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:06,587
Yes, and they are good fighters, too.

267
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:09,041
I'll tell the leaders you want to talk.

268
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:17,342
They've never seen men look like you.

269
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:25,809
Here are Mujahedin horsemen.

270
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:28,947
There are 10.000 horsemen
more waiting at the border.

271
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:30,866
They are waiting to get
weapons, when they'll get it,

272
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:32,725
they'll come back here to fight.

273
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,704
Let's go to the hospital.

274
00:29:58,032 --> 00:29:59,991
He is the only doctor for 500 km.

275
00:30:03,792 --> 00:30:05,942
The first medicine they
get in two months.

276
00:30:14,872 --> 00:30:18,501
More gifts from the Soviets. They
look like toys, but they're mines.

277
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:21,112
We teach the childrens not to
touch, some of them too late.

278
00:30:25,513 --> 00:30:26,992
Who's that?

279
00:30:27,433 --> 00:30:29,424
His name is Juri. He's Russian.

280
00:30:29,873 --> 00:30:31,032
A deserter?

281
00:30:31,033 --> 00:30:33,390
He calls himself a defector.
There are many like him.

282
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:37,732
He is the one who can help the most,
he knows the inside of the fort.

283
00:30:41,554 --> 00:30:43,110
I think we should go now.

284
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:07,753
Mines start here: one meter like
this, then two meters like this,

285
00:31:08,196 --> 00:31:09,344
and like this.

286
00:31:09,796 --> 00:31:12,310
There are four towers, four guards,

287
00:31:12,757 --> 00:31:15,749
here, here, here and here.

288
00:31:16,317 --> 00:31:17,456
Where do they keep the prisoners?

289
00:31:17,857 --> 00:31:18,994
Here.

290
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,909
If we get in there,
is there another way out?

291
00:31:23,678 --> 00:31:26,039
Underground, where
there's all dirty water.

292
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:28,793
But I do not know word for this place.

293
00:31:29,238 --> 00:31:31,467
He means sewer. Where is it?

294
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:36,035
Here. Outside, you go there.
Guards patrolls there.

295
00:31:36,838 --> 00:31:38,591
I do not think you go this way.

296
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,314
I wish we go to the minefields.
They'll never expect it.

297
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,770
This can not be done.
There are many Spetnaz commandos.

298
00:31:46,518 --> 00:31:49,137
We have all of this,
we've lost many men.

299
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,139
We'll lose more men if we go there.

300
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,798
I don't need many men.

301
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,398
What is it you want to do?

302
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,878
I need two men to lead
me to the minefield,

303
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:00,437
and two to help to escape.

304
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:03,917
If this is done, Soviets
will come here like before,

305
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,378
and more people will die.

306
00:32:06,378 --> 00:32:07,596
I can't wait.

307
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,595
You must wait for help the way we wait.

308
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,274
- Then I'll go alone.
- And you will die!

309
00:32:18,161 --> 00:32:19,753
Then I'll die.

310
00:32:24,921 --> 00:32:26,036
Wait!

311
00:32:27,482 --> 00:32:28,756
Please don't go.

312
00:32:36,562 --> 00:32:37,960
My name is Masoud.

313
00:32:39,402 --> 00:32:40,481
You must not judge us,

314
00:32:40,482 --> 00:32:43,260
before you understand why
we are not directed to help.

315
00:32:45,843 --> 00:32:47,833
Most of the Afghan
people are very strong,

316
00:32:48,283 --> 00:32:51,116
and we are determined not
to be driven from our land.

317
00:32:52,564 --> 00:32:56,539
Our children die of disease,
mines, and poison gas.

318
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,998
And our women are raped and killed.

319
00:33:00,643 --> 00:33:04,796
Last year, in the valley of
Legman, the next valley,

320
00:33:05,246 --> 00:33:06,623
6.000 Afghans were killed.

321
00:33:08,564 --> 00:33:11,079
Pregnant women were cut with bayonets,

322
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,720
and their babies thrown into the fire.

323
00:33:15,484 --> 00:33:19,638
This is done, so they will not have to
fight the next generation of Afghans.

324
00:33:20,086 --> 00:33:23,396
Yet nobody sees anything, or
reads anything in the papers.

325
00:33:24,885 --> 00:33:26,319
What you see here,

326
00:33:27,765 --> 00:33:29,721
are the Mujahedin soldiers,

327
00:33:30,205 --> 00:33:31,525
holy warriors.

328
00:33:31,966 --> 00:33:34,686
To us, this war is a holy war.

329
00:33:35,126 --> 00:33:37,521
And there is no true
death for a Mujahedin,

330
00:33:37,522 --> 00:33:39,916
because we have taken our last nights,

331
00:33:40,367 --> 00:33:43,120
and because we consider us already dead.

332
00:33:44,047 --> 00:33:47,437
To us, death for our
land and God is an honor.

333
00:33:47,887 --> 00:33:49,196
So, my friend,

334
00:33:50,647 --> 00:33:54,960
what we must do is to stop this
killing of our women and children.

335
00:33:56,729 --> 00:33:58,678
If getting this man free,

336
00:33:59,342 --> 00:34:05,141
so he can tells to the free world, and
tell what happens here, is necessary

337
00:34:05,188 --> 00:34:06,885
then of course we will help.

338
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:13,566
Leave us now, so we may
speak among ourselves

339
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,442
and find the best way to free this man.

340
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:24,530
- Thank you.
- We thank you.

341
00:34:47,732 --> 00:34:50,565
Don't worry, they will decide soon.

342
00:34:51,011 --> 00:34:53,269
- We got to leave tonight.
- What is your name?

343
00:34:56,812 --> 00:34:59,042
This boy is very hard inside.

344
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:01,007
His parents were killed last year.

345
00:35:02,453 --> 00:35:05,013
His brother died in the
fort where the American is.

346
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:08,285
He looks like a boy, but
he fights like a man.

347
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,962
- What's your name?
- Rambo.

348
00:35:11,413 --> 00:35:14,132
- Where are you from?
- Arizona.

349
00:35:14,574 --> 00:35:16,310
Arizona? How much days walk?

350
00:35:17,511 --> 00:35:18,646
About two years.

351
00:35:19,093 --> 00:35:20,288
Two years...

352
00:35:21,734 --> 00:35:24,282
- Are you a soldier?
- No more.

353
00:35:25,733 --> 00:35:28,453
I am a soldier. Are you here to fight?

354
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:30,966
- No.
- Are you scared?

355
00:35:33,934 --> 00:35:36,209
What is this?

356
00:35:36,655 --> 00:35:37,634
It's a knife.

357
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,213
- Can I see this?
- Sure.

358
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:48,134
Very good. Can I have it?

359
00:35:48,574 --> 00:35:49,529
No.

360
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:53,527
- What is this?
- You want everything!

361
00:35:53,977 --> 00:35:56,490
- This is for luck.
- What is luck?

362
00:35:56,935 --> 00:35:58,368
Luck is...

363
00:36:00,496 --> 00:36:02,231
Can I have it? I need luck.

364
00:36:02,232 --> 00:36:03,967
So do I!

365
00:36:07,377 --> 00:36:10,574
What a child! Always like this.

366
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:16,136
Look there! It's our national sport.

367
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:19,028
An old, insane game,
maybe 3.000 years old!

368
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:21,451
Look, they never stop playing.

369
00:36:25,338 --> 00:36:27,353
War or not war, they don't mind.

370
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,938
- You like it?
- I'll take football.

371
00:36:31,378 --> 00:36:34,415
What is football? You
play it with the foot?

372
00:36:34,858 --> 00:36:35,972
Not really.

373
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,778
Come on, let's go!

374
00:36:59,141 --> 00:37:01,974
- What are they saying?
- They want you to try.

375
00:37:02,421 --> 00:37:06,129
It's a way to them for you to be with
them. If you want to try, go ahead but

376
00:37:06,581 --> 00:37:08,855
I'm not responsible for it!

377
00:37:12,782 --> 00:37:14,773
- I'll try it.
- Yes?

378
00:37:16,661 --> 00:37:17,756
What are the rules?

379
00:37:17,857 --> 00:37:20,353
Well, you have to take
the sheep once around,

380
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:23,175
and then thrown it in the circle.

381
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,756
Why?

382
00:37:24,857 --> 00:37:25,971
Because there is a circle there.

383
00:37:28,142 --> 00:37:30,337
- That's it?
- That's it! Very simple.

384
00:37:32,482 --> 00:37:33,978
Like football.

385
00:37:33,979 --> 00:37:36,174
God must love crazy people!

386
00:37:36,982 --> 00:37:39,240
- Why?
- He makes so many of them!

387
00:44:59,214 --> 00:45:01,044
Now you see how it is here.

388
00:45:02,373 --> 00:45:05,205
Somewhere in a war,
there's supposed to be honor.

389
00:45:05,653 --> 00:45:08,009
Where is the honor here? Where?

390
00:45:10,934 --> 00:45:13,607
We're taking the survivors to
the border. Are you coming?

391
00:45:15,174 --> 00:45:16,402
I'm going to the fort.

392
00:45:16,853 --> 00:45:19,083
Have you not seen enough death?

393
00:45:19,815 --> 00:45:24,207
Go away while you can.
This is not your war.

394
00:45:27,254 --> 00:45:28,813
It is now.

395
00:45:32,495 --> 00:45:35,214
So be it.

396
00:45:35,656 --> 00:45:36,929
You are a good friend.

397
00:45:47,098 --> 00:45:49,486
I stay. I will show you the way.

398
00:45:49,937 --> 00:45:51,210
I will go too.

399
00:45:52,296 --> 00:45:53,285
No, you go with them.

400
00:45:53,736 --> 00:45:58,049
I will not. They killed all
my family. I want to fight!

401
00:45:59,137 --> 00:46:01,606
Not with me. You go!

402
00:46:03,058 --> 00:46:04,012
Go on.

403
00:46:09,178 --> 00:46:10,532
Why must you do this?

404
00:46:12,499 --> 00:46:14,296
Cause he'd do it for me.

405
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,936
Are you decided to talk?

406
00:46:41,979 --> 00:46:42,934
No?

407
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,169
Very well.

408
00:46:46,379 --> 00:46:50,260
Soon you will be my
guest down the hall...

409
00:48:18,387 --> 00:48:19,615
- Go back!
- No!

410
00:48:20,068 --> 00:48:21,056
Go back!

411
00:48:48,789 --> 00:48:50,017
Go on!

412
00:48:51,949 --> 00:48:53,165
Stay here! Stay back.

413
00:48:53,166 --> 00:48:54,782
I know this place. You need me!

414
00:48:55,229 --> 00:48:57,823
I don't need you dead!
Now go back. You understand?

415
00:55:43,777 --> 00:55:44,766
American?

416
00:55:46,297 --> 00:55:47,491
American?

417
00:56:09,019 --> 00:56:10,657
Colonel? Colonel?

418
00:56:16,739 --> 00:56:18,731
John? How the hell did you get in here?

419
00:56:19,181 --> 00:56:21,899
- Can you move?
- I can.

420
00:56:23,859 --> 00:56:25,009
Let's go!

421
00:56:29,779 --> 00:56:30,717
John, behind you!

422
00:56:41,101 --> 00:56:42,580
Go!

423
00:56:47,942 --> 00:56:50,057
John, get out of here!
Get the hell outta here!

424
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:44,127
Over here!

425
00:58:44,568 --> 00:58:45,445
Come on!

426
00:58:52,091 --> 00:58:53,410
Help me!

427
00:59:26,893 --> 00:59:28,372
Take him!

428
00:59:49,053 --> 00:59:50,009
Come on!

429
00:59:53,934 --> 00:59:55,128
Give me the boy!

430
01:00:14,134 --> 01:00:15,567
Come!

431
01:00:27,216 --> 01:00:28,046
Come on!

432
01:00:30,097 --> 01:00:31,213
Take the kid!

433
01:00:34,417 --> 01:00:35,567
Jump down!

434
01:01:46,063 --> 01:01:48,531
Give me the boy!

435
01:02:40,545 --> 01:02:44,425
Who is this terrorist? What
makes you so valuable to him?

436
01:02:44,865 --> 01:02:48,375
This bastard tried to destroy
me tonight. But he failed!

437
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:52,700
At sunrise, I will track him down, and
have his skin hanging on the wall!

438
01:02:53,147 --> 01:02:56,219
- You don't have to hunt him.
- What?

439
01:02:56,667 --> 01:02:58,180
He'll find you.

440
01:03:01,266 --> 01:03:03,418
Are you insane?

441
01:03:03,868 --> 01:03:06,826
One man against trained commandos?

442
01:03:07,268 --> 01:03:10,782
Who do you think this man is? God?

443
01:03:12,628 --> 01:03:15,745
No. God would have mercy. He won't!

444
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:31,448
It's all right. There's nobody there.

445
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:32,408
Good.

446
01:03:32,549 --> 01:03:33,566
This will hold a while.

447
01:03:35,066 --> 01:03:36,482
What's the fastest way outta here?

448
01:03:37,129 --> 01:03:39,668
Northwest, there's a
trail between mountains,

449
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:43,585
about three kilometers from
here. The trail is very difficult.

450
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:48,262
- You take the boy and go.
- I want to stay.

451
01:03:48,790 --> 01:03:50,121
You can't.

452
01:03:51,910 --> 01:03:54,949
You can not go back there.
We must all go to Pakistan.

453
01:03:55,591 --> 01:03:57,207
No, I gotta go back.

454
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:59,823
I know he's your friend,
but you can't do this!

455
01:04:00,271 --> 01:04:02,745
You both will die.
For what? Come with us!

456
01:04:02,846 --> 01:04:03,820
Just do what I say.

457
01:04:06,271 --> 01:04:08,705
Give me your gun.

458
01:04:13,752 --> 01:04:16,505
All right, let's go. Come on!

459
01:04:32,954 --> 01:04:34,945
I will see you again?

460
01:04:35,674 --> 01:04:36,629
Sure.

461
01:10:19,297 --> 01:10:20,616
Come on!

462
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:32,537
Can you fly that thing?

463
01:10:33,137 --> 01:10:34,015
Let's find out.

464
01:10:57,739 --> 01:10:59,331
Let's go!

465
01:11:25,261 --> 01:11:26,489
Hold on!

466
01:11:36,342 --> 01:11:37,775
Over there!

467
01:11:43,383 --> 01:11:44,293
There!

468
01:12:02,903 --> 01:12:04,336
Hold on!

469
01:12:04,784 --> 01:12:06,059
Get him up!

470
01:12:06,505 --> 01:12:08,381
Take my hand!

471
01:12:31,906 --> 01:12:32,815
We're going down!

472
01:12:47,788 --> 01:12:48,617
Hold on!

473
01:13:04,549 --> 01:13:06,106
Take what you can!

474
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:08,938
- Come on, move it, move it!
- Go on!

475
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:23,099
- We gotta hit the border.
- We stay here.

476
01:13:23,550 --> 01:13:24,948
We know where to go.

477
01:13:25,389 --> 01:13:28,267
- Which direction, John?
- Northeast!

478
01:14:14,393 --> 01:14:15,826
Hold it, John!

479
01:14:19,033 --> 01:14:20,589
I gotta rest a minute.

480
01:14:22,713 --> 01:14:23,671
How's your wound?

481
01:14:24,672 --> 01:14:26,627
You taught us to ignore
the pain, didn't ya?

482
01:14:27,075 --> 01:14:28,250
Has it worked?

483
01:14:29,649 --> 01:14:30,625
Not really!

484
01:14:32,113 --> 01:14:33,666
Don't take it personally!

485
01:14:35,274 --> 01:14:36,228
Thanks.

486
01:14:56,076 --> 01:14:58,636
You go on ahead and see if
you can find some cover.

487
01:16:07,921 --> 01:16:10,232
That was close, John! How are you?

488
01:16:11,081 --> 01:16:12,396
Well done!

489
01:16:23,402 --> 01:16:26,360
We won't make it easy for them.
We'd better split out!

490
01:16:27,602 --> 01:16:29,672
I'm sorry I got you into this, John!

491
01:16:30,121 --> 01:16:31,635
No, you're not!

492
01:17:29,766 --> 01:17:32,998
- Are you listening?
- Who are you?

493
01:17:34,327 --> 01:17:36,443
Your worst nightmare.

494
01:19:25,855 --> 01:19:26,811
It's good timing!

495
01:19:27,312 --> 01:19:28,267
What are friends for?

496
01:19:30,477 --> 01:19:32,877
You go back to the hole. I'll cover
you, and see if there's any more left.

497
01:22:42,348 --> 01:22:44,243
Across the valley is the border.

498
01:22:46,388 --> 01:22:47,658
We did it, John!

499
01:22:50,028 --> 01:22:51,256
Wait!

500
01:22:55,030 --> 01:22:56,985
What the hell is that?

501
01:23:00,228 --> 01:23:01,628
The son of a bitch!

502
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:28,820
Do not try to retreat!

503
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:30,671
You can not escape.

504
01:23:31,111 --> 01:23:33,341
We will not attack if you do not run!

505
01:23:33,991 --> 01:23:35,206
We do not want to hurt you.

506
01:23:36,207 --> 01:23:37,222
Somehow I don't believe him!

507
01:23:37,672 --> 01:23:41,505
I order you to come forward,
and you will be given a fair trial.

508
01:23:41,951 --> 01:23:44,404
Drop your weapons,
and remain where you are.

509
01:23:44,552 --> 01:23:46,270
You got any ideas?

510
01:23:47,592 --> 01:23:49,867
Drop your weapons!

511
01:23:50,511 --> 01:23:52,162
Surrounding them, Sir.

512
01:23:53,752 --> 01:23:56,268
Helluva time for humor, John!

513
01:23:56,713 --> 01:23:59,022
Drop your weapons! Now!

514
01:24:00,473 --> 01:24:02,066
You have no chance of escape.

515
01:24:02,513 --> 01:24:06,142
Come forward! I want
to pick you back alive.

516
01:24:06,592 --> 01:24:08,710
This is your last warning!

517
01:24:11,835 --> 01:24:13,029
The choice is yours.

518
01:24:13,474 --> 01:24:15,065
What do you say, John?

519
01:24:17,193 --> 01:24:19,154
Fuck 'em!

520
01:24:36,637 --> 01:24:39,024
If we're gonna go, I would
crave to take that bastard with us!

521
01:25:15,598 --> 01:25:16,668
What is that?

522
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:27,917
It's the rebels!

523
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:40,790
Come on!

524
01:29:16,615 --> 01:29:17,491
John, get out of there!

525
01:30:49,621 --> 01:30:52,978
You're sure you don't want to stay?
You fight good for a tourist!

526
01:30:55,822 --> 01:30:57,197
Maybe next time.

527
01:30:58,542 --> 01:31:00,100
Do you want this back?

528
01:31:01,101 --> 01:31:03,570
No. You keep it.

529
01:31:04,261 --> 01:31:05,854
Can you not stay?

530
01:31:19,104 --> 01:31:20,378
I gotta go.

531
01:31:44,145 --> 01:31:45,499
Goodbye.

532
01:31:53,345 --> 01:31:54,363
Hard to believe, John!

533
01:31:55,162 --> 01:31:56,079
What's that, Sir?

534
