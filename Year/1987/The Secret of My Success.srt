1
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:21,572
New York City.

2
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,905
He wants to see what's there.

3
00:00:23,907 --> 00:00:25,705
I can tell him what's there.

4
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:29,251
I don't know how,
when you've never been.

5
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:27,601
Well, Toto, I guess
we're not in Kansas any more.

6
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:33,353
I can't figure out why he'd want to go
to New York when we got everything here.

7
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:36,572
Somethin' I have to do, Dad.

8
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:39,241
Did you pack an iron
like I told you to?

9
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:40,442
Mom.

10
00:01:40,526 --> 00:01:43,700
You're gonna walk around
wrinkled in New York if you don't.

11
00:01:43,779 --> 00:01:47,534
Elmer Whitfield's cousin Carlton
went off to New York a normal boy.

12
00:01:47,616 --> 00:01:51,211
Came back with his head shaved
and an earring stuck in his cheek.

13
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:32,293
Mom, there's
a whole world out there.

14
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:34,918
I mean big, exciting.

15
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:37,336
I got a nice,
small apartment lined up.

16
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,669
I got a great job.

17
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:42,095
I wanna make lots of money.

18
00:02:42,212 --> 00:02:46,217
I want to have a meaningful experience
with an incredibly beautiful woman.

19
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:49,432
I can't even take a woman like that
to a small apartment.

20
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:52,014
- I gotta get a penthouse.
- A penthouse?

21
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,062
With a Jacuzzi in it.

22
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:58,062
Doin' this for you
as much as for me, Mom.

23
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:02,195
All those years of college...
They're gonna start payin' off.

24
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:02,835
Back!

25
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:21,024
All right, listen up.

26
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:24,448
If there are any bugs in here or rats or
anything that has more legs than I do...

27
00:04:24,523 --> 00:04:27,402
you just stay on your side
of the room, okay?

28
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,486
I'll stay on mine.

29
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,324
I should warn you.
I'm packing an iron.

30
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:38,211
You weren't listening.

31
00:04:57,931 --> 00:05:00,309
Darling, please pack it
as fast as you can.

32
00:05:00,392 --> 00:05:02,850
- Mr Forbush?
- Not me! He's two doors down the hall.

33
00:05:02,853 --> 00:05:05,072
Into the shredder
as fast as possible.

34
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:11,279
- Mr Forbush.
- Yep.

35
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:14,285
Hi, I'm Brantley Foster
from Kansas.

36
00:05:14,364 --> 00:05:17,413
- You hired me. I start work here today.
- You're fired, kid. Sorry.

37
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:20,086
We all saw it coming, but we
looked for some kind of miracle.

38
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:21,755
Miracle never happened.

39
00:05:21,913 --> 00:05:23,790
- What did happen?
- Hostile takeover.

40
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:26,718
Ninety percent of the people
in this building are out on the street.

41
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:30,388
You are one of those 90%.
Tough break.

42
00:05:31,632 --> 00:05:35,557
Mr Forbush, I was counting on this job.
What do I do now?

43
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:37,896
Punt!

44
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:45,316
Okay, New York...

45
00:05:45,395 --> 00:05:47,944
if this is the way
you want it, okay.

46
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:52,278
- I'm sorry, Mister...
- Foster.

47
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:55,414
I'm sorry, Mr Foster.
We need someone with experience.

48
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:59,744
But how can I get experience until
I get a job that gives me experience?

49
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,994
If we gave you a job
just to give you experience...

50
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,748
you'd take that experience
and get a better job.

51
00:06:04,873 --> 00:06:07,163
Then that experience
would benefit someone else.

52
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:10,171
But I was trained in college
to handle a job like this.

53
00:06:10,253 --> 00:06:13,348
So in a sense,
I already have experience.

54
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,300
What you've got is
college experience...

55
00:06:15,384 --> 00:06:18,854
not the practical, hard-nosed business
experience we're looking for.

56
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:22,274
If you'd joined our training program out
of high school, you'd be qualified now.

57
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,192
Then why did I go to college?

58
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:26,277
Had fun, didn't you?

59
00:06:29,523 --> 00:06:31,366
What impresses me most...

60
00:06:31,441 --> 00:06:35,116
is the amount of experience you picked
up while still attending college.

61
00:06:35,278 --> 00:06:38,248
Well, ma'am, I knew all
those years of college...

62
00:06:38,323 --> 00:06:41,918
would be worthless without practical,
hard-nosed business experience.

63
00:06:41,993 --> 00:06:45,213
"Assistant personnel manager,
J. Hall Communications.

64
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:48,462
Junior purchasing agent,
Midland Furniture.

65
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:51,591
Vice President in Charge of
Production, Central Manufacturing."

66
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:54,048
Outstanding.

67
00:06:56,299 --> 00:06:59,223
You're not gonna tell me I have
too much experience, are you?

68
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:01,725
Certainly not.
You're perfect for the job.

69
00:07:01,805 --> 00:07:03,352
- Great!
- Except...

70
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:05,776
No.
No exceptions.

71
00:07:05,851 --> 00:07:08,183
I want this job.
I need it. I can do it.

72
00:07:08,186 --> 00:07:10,405
Everywhere I've been today
there's been something wrong.

73
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,778
Too young, too old,
too short, too tall.

74
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:14,943
Whatever the exception is,
I can fix it.

75
00:07:15,026 --> 00:07:17,529
I can be older. I can be taller.
I can be anything.

76
00:07:17,612 --> 00:07:19,706
Can you be a minority woman?

77
00:07:22,284 --> 00:07:25,754
- Mom, I'm doin' great.
- Is it dirty? Are the people rude?

78
00:07:25,829 --> 00:07:28,503
No, this town is terrific.
The people are really nice.

79
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:32,086
<i>- That's good. What about your job?</i>
- Job? Hey!

80
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:35,756
I got a fantastic office,
got a gorgeous secretary. The works.

81
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:38,513
<i>We don't care if she's gorgeous.
Is she any good?</i>

82
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:41,477
- What?
- <i>You heard me. Can she type?</i>

83
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:43,351
Ma, of course she can type.

84
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,105
<i>Some can't, you know. Is it safe there?
You haven't been robbed?</i>

85
00:07:47,184 --> 00:07:50,279
Ma, will you quit worryin'?
There is no danger.

86
00:07:50,353 --> 00:07:54,449
- <i>But New York is...</i>
- New York is like Kansas intensified.

87
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,574
- What?
- <i>What's that? Something the matter?</i>

88
00:07:58,653 --> 00:08:01,122
No, Mom.
That's just the TV.

89
00:08:01,198 --> 00:08:03,576
<i>- It sounds so real.</i>
- It's Miami Vice.

90
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,873
<i>Can you turn the sound down?
It's too loud.</i>

91
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,081
Ma, it's broken.
The knob came off in my hand.

92
00:08:09,164 --> 00:08:13,449
<i>Goodness. Well, what about
Uncle Howard? Did you call him?</i>

93
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,054
Uncle Howard!
Yeah, the phone number.

94
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:18,506
<i>Well, you still have
the number, don't you?</i>

95
00:08:18,507 --> 00:08:21,852
Oh, yeah.
I got it right here.

96
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:24,312
<i>Are you all right?
You seem distracted.</i>

97
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,389
They just totalled a Ferrari.

98
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:29,226
<i>But Uncle Howard...
did you call him?</i>

99
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,812
No, I haven't had a chance
to call Uncle Howard yet.

100
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:33,647
<i>Will you try to see him?</i>

101
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,573
I'll probably bump into him
at the country club.

102
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:38,156
<i>Get the TV fixed, dear.</i>

103
00:08:38,235 --> 00:08:39,862
Yeah.

104
00:08:39,945 --> 00:08:43,370
- Listen, I gotta go. Okay?
- <i>Okay.</i>

105
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:46,206
- Give Dad my love.
<i>- I will, dear. I love you, Brantley.</i>

106
00:08:46,284 --> 00:08:50,130
- I love you too, Mom. Bye-bye.
- Bye!

107
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:36,336
Well, at least let me
buy you an airline ticket.

108
00:09:36,501 --> 00:09:38,503
Dad, I'm gonna do this
on my own.

109
00:09:38,587 --> 00:09:41,340
But you did make it
a round-trip ticket?

110
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:43,972
Yeah. I'm not
gonna need it.

111
00:09:44,843 --> 00:09:48,268
No, when I come back to Kansas,
I'm comin' back in my own jet.

112
00:10:06,907 --> 00:10:10,411
Take this. It's Uncle Howard's
phone number in New York.

113
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:12,291
I got an uncle in New York?

114
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:15,256
My cousin Ellen married
his half sister's nephew...

115
00:10:15,332 --> 00:10:18,176
before she got bit
by that dog and died.

116
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,629
But he's still kin,
and kin is kin.

117
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:25,986
Hi.

118
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:29,531
I'd like to see
Mr Prescott, please.

119
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:31,948
Do you have an appointment?

120
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,999
I tried to get one, but I couldn't,
so I just thought I'd surprise him.

121
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:37,456
Mr Prescott
doesn't like surprises.

122
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,709
- Everybody likes surprises.
- Not Mr Prescott.

123
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,713
- You can leave your name.
- Brantley Foster.

124
00:11:44,796 --> 00:11:48,221
- Of?
- Of Kansas.

125
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,268
Of what company?

126
00:11:52,429 --> 00:11:54,898
What do you wanna see
Mr Prescott about?

127
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:00,349
About being his nephew.

128
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:03,106
Well, why don't you
have a seat?

129
00:12:03,231 --> 00:12:05,700
I'll see if I can work you
into Mr Prescott's schedule.

130
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:07,197
Thank you.

131
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:34,141
Give Uncle Howard my card.

132
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:44,064
Are you really
Mr Prescott's nephew?

133
00:12:46,024 --> 00:12:48,026
In a roundabout sort of way.

134
00:12:48,109 --> 00:12:51,534
You sons of bitches don't
have a half a brain between you!

135
00:12:51,613 --> 00:12:54,867
I'm looking at
a $300 million deficit here...

136
00:12:54,949 --> 00:12:58,419
because you idiots didn't anticipate
the needs of a changing market!

137
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,248
- Uncle Howard?
- Now, get out, all of you!

138
00:13:01,372 --> 00:13:03,662
And bring me back some
new ideas that'll work!

139
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:07,261
Or I'll have your heads
mounted on my wall!

140
00:13:07,378 --> 00:13:10,177
- Geez, he's gonna burst a blood vessel.
- Yeah, wishful thinking.

141
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,631
I'll see if I can
get you in now.

142
00:13:13,635 --> 00:13:15,012
Thank you.

143
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:18,640
You know, it can't be good
for his heart to shout that way.

144
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:20,725
He doesn't have a heart.

145
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:25,064
- What, Maureen, what?
- Brantley Foster is here to see you.

146
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:27,194
I don't know any Brantley Foster.

147
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:30,025
- Your nephew from Kansas.
- Who?

148
00:13:30,026 --> 00:13:33,656
- He says he's your nephew from Kansas.
- Kansas?

149
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,543
Mr Prescott will see you now.

150
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,717
Clever.

151
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,640
So you're one
of the Kansas Fosters, huh?

152
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:55,218
Shirttail relative,
to say the least.

153
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,182
Listen...

154
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,807
I know you probably told your secretary
to get me outta here in five minutes.

155
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,767
- Two.
- Right.

156
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:06,947
So I'll get right to the point.

157
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,235
- I need a job, Uncle Howard.
- Around here, I'm Mr Prescott.

158
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:13,949
Do you have any idea
what we do here?

159
00:14:14,028 --> 00:14:15,450
Yes, sir.

160
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:18,905
Pemrose is a multinational conglomerate
with 27 different divisions.

161
00:14:18,908 --> 00:14:22,037
Products ranging from dog food
to guided missile systems.

162
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,124
There are 30,000 people
working in this building alone.

163
00:14:25,206 --> 00:14:28,176
Their accumulated salary is higher
than the gross national product...

164
00:14:28,251 --> 00:14:31,050
of half the nations
in the Common Market.

165
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:36,010
Last year we borrowed more money
from banks than Mexico did.

166
00:14:36,134 --> 00:14:38,254
It's a great company, Uncle...

167
00:14:38,261 --> 00:14:41,515
Mr Prescott. That's why I'm here.

168
00:14:43,266 --> 00:14:46,987
What can you do for us, Brantley?
What experience have you had?

169
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:50,907
Practically none.

170
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:54,411
But I believe in myself.

171
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,451
Doesn't that count? Deep inside, I know
I can do anything if I get a chance.

172
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,293
Think back to when
you were my ahe.

173
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,707
Remember how you felt when
you went after that first job.

174
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,710
Remember how
you wanted it so badly...

175
00:15:10,793 --> 00:15:12,795
you couldn't sleep
the night before the interview.

176
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,052
Remember how crushed you were
when the guy said...

177
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:17,133
"What kind
of experience have you got?"

178
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:21,222
You wanted to shake
your fists and say...

179
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:24,854
"I can do anything
if I can just get a chance."

180
00:15:26,017 --> 00:15:28,611
They're ready for you
in the boardroom, Mr Prescott.

181
00:15:32,482 --> 00:15:35,406
Call Bates in Personnel.
Tell him I'm sending somebody up.

182
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:38,954
Well, you're
in the front door, kid.

183
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,658
What you do on this side of it
is up to you.

184
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:49,580
Congratulations. He really
must have taken a shine to you.

185
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:53,212
Thanks.
He's a warm guy.

186
00:16:01,844 --> 00:16:03,096
May I?

187
00:17:48,576 --> 00:17:51,375
You can't come in here, bozo.
Take your crap to the mail slot.

188
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:53,294
I work here.
Just started.

189
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,217
What do you want, an engraved
invitation? Come on. Come on.

190
00:18:00,254 --> 00:18:02,803
Brantley, eh?
Somebody gave you that name?

191
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:07,770
Jesus, a college puke!
This really makes my day.

192
00:18:07,845 --> 00:18:10,143
- Well, you're welcome.
- Melrose, get over here!

193
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,607
Listen to what he says,
then do what he does.

194
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,450
Stay out of my way. Don't use
the stamp machine for personal letters.

195
00:18:21,526 --> 00:18:24,871
Take off that stupid-looking tie.
Looks like you shot your couch.

196
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:27,324
- You got any questions?
- Yeah. What do I call you?

197
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:30,160
- Call me God.
- Got a problem, Boss? I'm your man.

198
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:33,037
Show the college puke the ropes
and keep him outta my face.

199
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:35,544
His name is Brantley.

200
00:18:35,623 --> 00:18:38,001
All right, kid.
Follow me.

201
00:18:39,127 --> 00:18:42,381
<i>All right, you stick with me
and everything's gonna be copacetic.</i>

202
00:18:42,463 --> 00:18:45,840
<i>Twice a day you deliver. Like a mailman,
you pick up whatever's goin 'out.</i>

203
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:49,016
<i>I can do it in 30 minutes. Rattigan
thinks it takes me two hours.</i>

204
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:51,268
What's this department?
What do they do here?

205
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:55,352
Who knows? This place is a zoo.
Nobody knows what anybody else is doin'.

206
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,483
Can you get promoted
out of the mailroom?

207
00:18:57,562 --> 00:19:01,738
You can't even get paroled out of
the mailroom. Excuse me, dear.

208
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:04,865
Good morning.

209
00:19:04,944 --> 00:19:07,447
- Nix.
- What?

210
00:19:07,572 --> 00:19:10,416
- Good morning.
- Look, not the suits.

211
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:12,960
- What do you mean?
- Excuse me, sir.

212
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:15,492
- Good morning.
- Look, not the suits, man.

213
00:19:15,496 --> 00:19:18,966
You never consort with the suits,
unless they consort with you first.

214
00:19:19,709 --> 00:19:23,054
That's ridiculous. He's a person.
I'm a person. I can't say hello?

215
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,881
He's not a person.
He's a suit.

216
00:19:24,964 --> 00:19:27,968
You're mailroom.
No consorting. Come on.

217
00:19:30,261 --> 00:19:32,013
We're entering
a sensitive zone.

218
00:19:32,096 --> 00:19:34,190
This guy in that office
just got canned.

219
00:19:34,265 --> 00:19:36,859
Mailroom knew about it on Friday.
He just found out today.

220
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:40,029
No kidding.
Is his job still open?

221
00:19:40,104 --> 00:19:42,653
No, man, an economic cutback.
His job was dissolved.

222
00:19:42,732 --> 00:19:45,281
About two dozen
suits got the ax.

223
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:51,161
Will you quit trying to consort?
Come on.

224
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:58,165
<i>All right, the yellow ones
go to purchasing.</i>

225
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:00,750
<i>All the white ones are a bunch
of suits talkin 'to themselves.</i>

226
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:11,227
You're supposed to
deliver 'em, not read 'em.

227
00:20:11,302 --> 00:20:13,521
Some of this stuff
doesn't make any sense.

228
00:20:13,596 --> 00:20:15,564
They send requisitions
through two departments...

229
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,313
to get procurements
for a third.

230
00:20:17,391 --> 00:20:19,769
- What kind of thinking is that?
- That's suit thinking.

231
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,355
Something happens to a man
when he puts on a necktie.

232
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:24,315
Cuts off all the oxygen
to his brain.

233
00:20:26,943 --> 00:20:30,573
You crazy? You're not supposed to
take the memos out of the mailroom.

234
00:20:30,655 --> 00:20:33,579
I can't follow a chain of
command in this company.

235
00:20:33,658 --> 00:20:37,003
They got the right title, but their job
assignments and objectives are screwed...

236
00:20:37,078 --> 00:20:39,547
- Look at this. Jesus. Purchasing.
- What?

237
00:20:39,664 --> 00:20:42,133
It's a joke. They've got two people
doin' basically the same job.

238
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:44,051
Neither one of them
is doin' it right.

239
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:46,128
I'll bring it up at the next
stockholders meeting.

240
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:49,432
- Would you put these things away?
- Whoa, Melrose.

241
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:53,436
How ya doin'? We've been gettin'
a lot of requests in the mailroom...

242
00:20:53,511 --> 00:20:56,811
for stockholder information,
company assets, expenditures.

243
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,517
- Anything you can give us.
- You're kidding?

244
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,149
Any of this research
you want, you can have.

245
00:21:02,937 --> 00:21:05,611
- Take it all.
- Thanks very much.

246
00:22:24,268 --> 00:22:27,067
She's the most incredible-looking woman
I've ever seen in my life.

247
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:31,447
She's a Rolls-Royce,
but she's also a suit.

248
00:22:32,735 --> 00:22:35,534
What's she like?
What do you know about her?

249
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:37,988
I know enough never
to consort with the suits, pal.

250
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:41,711
- Even when they do have legs like hers.
- Come on. You know more than that.

251
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:43,625
Her name is Christy Wills.

252
00:22:43,704 --> 00:22:46,082
She's supposed to be some
sort of financial wizard, you know?

253
00:22:46,165 --> 00:22:47,838
Harvard.
All that crap.

254
00:22:51,128 --> 00:22:53,051
And forget it.

255
00:23:10,564 --> 00:23:13,317
No.
That's Transportation's problem.

256
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:15,699
No, we do not supply drivers
for executives' wives.

257
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,868
We are a messenger service.

258
00:23:17,947 --> 00:23:20,917
I don't care if the other
drivers are all busy.

259
00:23:22,451 --> 00:23:24,829
Yeah, well, the same
to you, sweetheart.

260
00:23:25,496 --> 00:23:27,874
Hey, Dartmouth, get over here.

261
00:23:27,957 --> 00:23:30,210
Executive's wife wants
a ride up to Litchfield.

262
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:33,592
- Check out a car and drive her.
- Where's Litchfield?

263
00:23:33,671 --> 00:23:36,220
You'll find it. Just follow
the smell of money.

264
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:48,477
Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm not quite sure which way...

265
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,861
Turn the key, start the car,
put it in drive and step on the gas.

266
00:23:51,939 --> 00:23:54,692
Any idiot can do that,
even my husband.

267
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:01,248
Excuse me, ma'am.

268
00:24:01,323 --> 00:24:03,951
- I know I'm not supposed to consort...
- Then don't.

269
00:24:06,203 --> 00:24:09,673
You seem kind of upset. I was wonderin'
if there was anything I could do.

270
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,635
I don't know.
My cook quit this morning.

271
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:15,259
My analyst is away on vacation.
My Mercedes broke down.

272
00:24:15,379 --> 00:24:19,100
I split my nail, and my husband
is screwing somebody at the office.

273
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:21,428
What did you have in mind?

274
00:24:22,595 --> 00:24:24,393
Stick of gum?

275
00:24:28,142 --> 00:24:32,022
This is the third weekend he's found
an excuse not to come to the country.

276
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:36,985
No, I don't know. But knowing him,
it's probably some teenage airhead...

277
00:24:36,986 --> 00:24:38,736
from the steno pool.

278
00:24:39,904 --> 00:24:42,123
The last one I caught
him with was so dumb...

279
00:24:42,124 --> 00:24:46,210
she thought dictation
was some kind of S and M trip.

280
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:48,208
Do you know my husband?

281
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:51,336
I'm sorry.
I can't hear you.

282
00:24:51,415 --> 00:24:53,292
Never mind.

283
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:57,300
- Didn't hear a thing.
- I'm gonna have to call you back.

284
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,718
I'm so mad, I could spit.

285
00:25:02,384 --> 00:25:05,308
He looks twice as good today
as the day we were married.

286
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:07,431
I just look twice as old.

287
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,483
Are you kiddin'?

288
00:25:11,727 --> 00:25:14,822
I hope that when I'm his age,
I can wake up every morning...

289
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:18,618
and find a woman as beautiful
as you are lying next to me.

290
00:25:20,069 --> 00:25:21,446
Thank you.

291
00:26:55,623 --> 00:26:57,421
Turn in here.

292
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:00,218
Please.

293
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:07,654
- Bring those inside. Charles.
- May I help you with those, sir?

294
00:28:07,736 --> 00:28:09,613
What are you drinking?

295
00:28:09,738 --> 00:28:12,412
I can't really.
I have to get back.

296
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,628
God, I hate the country.

297
00:28:17,454 --> 00:28:20,424
Yeah, I can see
how you'd be real miserable here.

298
00:28:21,959 --> 00:28:24,257
Who can live
with so many trees?

299
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:26,464
They suck up all the oxygen.

300
00:28:27,381 --> 00:28:29,884
No, actually,
trees produce oxygen.

301
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:32,011
Who are you?
Mr Wizard?

302
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:35,435
What did you say your name was?

303
00:28:36,098 --> 00:28:38,692
- Brantley.
- No, I mean your first name.

304
00:28:40,269 --> 00:28:42,397
That's it: Brantley.

305
00:28:42,479 --> 00:28:46,029
Well, Brantley, I don't know what
you want out of Pemrose Corporation...

306
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,193
but I'll tell you
what you do not want.

307
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:51,614
You don't ever, ever
wanna become a corporate wife.

308
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:54,784
I'll watch my step.

309
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:02,757
Have another.

310
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:08,096
Thanks.

311
00:29:08,964 --> 00:29:11,137
I've run 8,000 miles
on that tennis court...

312
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:15,062
chasing a fuzzy, little yellow ball
with an oversized racket.

313
00:29:15,137 --> 00:29:16,980
Do my legs look heavy to you?

314
00:29:19,349 --> 00:29:20,350
No.

315
00:29:20,434 --> 00:29:23,813
I've swum laps from here
to the moon in that pool.

316
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:27,491
Do you see anything
in this body that isn't firm?

317
00:29:29,985 --> 00:29:33,279
Tennis, swimming,
aerobics, jogging, massage...

318
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,284
Anything and everything
to stay in shape.

319
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:38,368
Not that he'd ever notice.

320
00:29:39,536 --> 00:29:43,382
So, Brantley, do you
know why I stay in shape?

321
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:52,007
- How 'bout a dip in the pool?
- No, wait!

322
00:29:52,091 --> 00:29:54,594
Are you serious?
Listen...

323
00:29:54,676 --> 00:29:58,772
I have to get back. This is a
tempting diversion, but I got a job.

324
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:02,522
- I don't know if this is a good idea.
- Transportation, please.

325
00:30:02,643 --> 00:30:05,943
Yes. The young man from the
mailroom who drove me home?

326
00:30:05,944 --> 00:30:10,024
He's going to stay here and do
a little work in my garden.

327
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:13,245
See that he gets full credit
on his time card.

328
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,867
Thank you.

329
00:30:15,572 --> 00:30:17,995
Help me out of this, will you, dear?

330
00:30:34,758 --> 00:30:38,638
- That was great.
- Thanks. I swim five miles a day.

331
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,599
- Supposed to tone my ass.
- Yeah, it works.

332
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:46,733
Just when I thought it was safe
to go back in the water.

333
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,335
- You sure this is a good idea?
- It's okay. I know the owner.

334
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:05,171
Last one out of the...

335
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,588
- Sure your husband's not coming home?
- Who knows?

336
00:31:13,046 --> 00:31:14,889
He could be home any minute...

337
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:17,680
or several hours from now.

338
00:31:21,471 --> 00:31:23,599
Oh, my God.

339
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:37,162
I'm gonna see that
my husband gives you a leg up.

340
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,374
I think we've done pretty well
so far by ourselves.

341
00:31:43,076 --> 00:31:45,204
I mean Pemrose.

342
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:50,168
No.

343
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,211
No, thanks.

344
00:31:53,337 --> 00:31:55,965
No, I'm gonna make it
to the top by myself.

345
00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:00,052
God, you're adorable.

346
00:32:03,347 --> 00:32:07,568
I could spend a week inside
those sweet, unwrinkled eyes.

347
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:12,815
- Can I make a personal observation?
- Anything but the thighs.

348
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,320
Somebody sold you a bill of goods and
convinced you you had to be 21 forever.

349
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:21,748
That's bullshit!
I think you're terrific.

350
00:32:21,823 --> 00:32:24,451
The only thing wrong with you
is your husband is a jerk.

351
00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:26,707
You're beautiful.
You're intelligent.

352
00:32:26,787 --> 00:32:29,006
You're sensuous.

353
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,713
Say that again!

354
00:32:33,543 --> 00:32:36,217
- Which part?
- All of it!

355
00:32:39,675 --> 00:32:41,677
Oh, no!

356
00:32:42,469 --> 00:32:45,018
- What? What is it?
- It's the jerk.

357
00:32:51,144 --> 00:32:52,691
My husband.

358
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:57,739
- My uncle.
- Your what?

359
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:00,487
- Oh, God! That makes you...
- Auntie Vera?

360
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:08,962
What's my mother gonna say?

361
00:33:09,037 --> 00:33:11,790
- I've disgraced my whole family.
- The hell you did!

362
00:33:12,541 --> 00:33:15,545
Not funny! Okay?
This is not a funny moment in my life.

363
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,800
Relax.
Who's gonna find out?

364
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:19,756
I'm home!

365
00:33:20,882 --> 00:33:23,556
He's gonna find out.
That's who's gonna find out.

366
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,683
Don't worry!
He won't fire you.

367
00:33:25,762 --> 00:33:28,436
There's no way I'm gonna
get a raise out of this.

368
00:33:28,515 --> 00:33:31,485
Vera, what's the company car
doing in the driveway?

369
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,814
It broke down, darling. The driver
had to take the train back to town.

370
00:33:34,896 --> 00:33:37,740
No, he didn't, darling. He's in here
having trouble with his fly.

371
00:33:37,816 --> 00:33:40,114
- Get back! Do you ever stop?
- No!

372
00:33:40,235 --> 00:33:42,363
How am I gonna get home?

373
00:33:42,446 --> 00:33:45,245
Maybe we'll just have to keep
you here and adopt you.

374
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:47,618
You're a riot, Vera.

375
00:33:58,128 --> 00:34:00,130
Please, Lord,
get me out of this.

376
00:34:00,213 --> 00:34:03,433
I'll go all over the world telling
people not to screw the boss's wife.

377
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:07,809
- What are you doing in here?
- Feeling romantic.

378
00:34:07,888 --> 00:34:10,391
What's for dinner?

379
00:34:10,474 --> 00:34:14,820
Oh, Howard! You really know how
to sweep a girl back onto her feet.

380
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:23,745
Go back!

381
00:34:29,117 --> 00:34:31,165
Sit! Sit down!

382
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:40,671
You look like death on a cracker, man.
What happened to you?

383
00:34:40,754 --> 00:34:44,554
I was chased by a 200-pound dog
with a mouth as big as my head.

384
00:34:44,633 --> 00:34:46,975
And that was the best thing
that happened last night.

385
00:34:46,976 --> 00:34:49,517
- What was the worst thing?
- I got laid.

386
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,977
I'm not sure you got
your priorities straight.

387
00:34:56,561 --> 00:34:58,313
Hold the elevator.
Good morning.

388
00:34:59,022 --> 00:35:00,740
Hi.

389
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:35,108
<i>We're entering a sensitive zone.</i>

390
00:35:35,183 --> 00:35:37,402
<i>The guy in that office
just got canned.</i>

391
00:35:37,477 --> 00:35:40,822
<i>The mailroom knew about it on Friday.
He just found out today.</i>

392
00:36:18,894 --> 00:36:21,522
<i>I'm gonna see
that my husband gives you a leg up.</i>

393
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:23,699
No, thanks.

394
00:36:24,774 --> 00:36:26,242
No.

395
00:36:27,611 --> 00:36:30,080
No, I'm gonna make it
to the top on my own.

396
00:37:20,622 --> 00:37:23,671
- Hello.
<i>- Tucker, where the hell have you been?</i>

397
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,718
We got a problem
in Midwest Distribution.

398
00:37:25,794 --> 00:37:28,343
What are you gonna do about it?

399
00:37:28,505 --> 00:37:31,008
What's the problem?

400
00:37:31,091 --> 00:37:34,641
Our stock is down
another quarter point this morning.

401
00:37:34,761 --> 00:37:36,604
Whose fault is that, Thomas?

402
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,524
Nobody's fault, sir.
It's a momentary lapse in the market.

403
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,853
- Whose fault is it, Thomas?
- It's Davis's fault, sir.

404
00:37:42,936 --> 00:37:45,153
His department hasn't been
pulling its weight.

405
00:37:45,154 --> 00:37:48,320
- What do you have to say for yourself?
- I've been having troubles at home.

406
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,823
My wife ran over
the children's dog with her car...

407
00:37:50,902 --> 00:37:52,904
then we had to buy a new dog.

408
00:37:52,988 --> 00:37:56,208
Then the new dog chewed up this
entire report that I'd been working on.

409
00:37:57,033 --> 00:38:00,162
Are you suggesting
that your dog ate your homework?

410
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,043
In a way, yes, sir.

411
00:38:02,122 --> 00:38:05,922
This is not grade school, Davis!
Run at the back of the line.

412
00:38:06,001 --> 00:38:08,003
- Consider yourself on warning.
- Yes, sir.

413
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:12,432
Everybody, check your pulse. Make sure
you're exercising at the optimum level.

414
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:17,145
I'm a bit above my level.
I better stop running now, maybe.

415
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,895
- I'm above too.
- I really don't care. Everybody, run!

416
00:38:20,974 --> 00:38:25,400
<i>I can't get anybody's approval
for the extra two trucks!</i>

417
00:38:25,478 --> 00:38:27,731
<i>Tucker, what're you
gonna do about it?</i>

418
00:38:28,982 --> 00:38:32,407
All right, look.
What does a boxcar cost?

419
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:34,871
The transfer sheet
shows that somebody...

420
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:37,415
is accumulating
an enormous block of our stock.

421
00:38:37,532 --> 00:38:40,911
- What do you think about that, Thomas?
- I think it's very encouraging.

422
00:38:40,994 --> 00:38:43,203
- You do, do you?
- Yes, sir.

423
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:45,582
When a stock takes a dive
and somebody buys a ton of it...

424
00:38:45,665 --> 00:38:48,009
It means that stock is
on its way to a quick rebound.

425
00:38:48,084 --> 00:38:51,382
It means that the company
is ripe for a hostile takeover!

426
00:38:51,383 --> 00:38:54,428
- That's what I meant!
- A hostile takeover, sir?

427
00:38:54,507 --> 00:38:57,306
Yes. I'm afraid that's
what we're looking at.

428
00:38:57,385 --> 00:38:59,353
I want each of you
to examine your department...

429
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:01,272
and see where you
can cut costs.

430
00:39:01,389 --> 00:39:03,357
Cut! Cut them to the core!

431
00:39:03,433 --> 00:39:06,357
We need to raise capital quickly
so we can boost stock support.

432
00:39:06,436 --> 00:39:10,236
Boost it!
Boost it to the moon!

433
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:12,317
You gonna put that in writin'?

434
00:39:15,445 --> 00:39:17,243
Yeah.

435
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:20,201
You tell the trucking company that
we have to service our customers.

436
00:39:20,283 --> 00:39:23,787
If they're not gonna help us,
we're gonna find somebody who will.

437
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,668
Well, all right!

438
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:29,339
That's what we need, some gutsy
decisions! I'll get back to you.

439
00:39:29,417 --> 00:39:31,590
Okay. Bye.

440
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:34,256
Yes!

441
00:40:26,808 --> 00:40:29,059
I have got to get that report
by the end of the day, Art...

442
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,733
or you're in the doghouse!

443
00:40:30,854 --> 00:40:32,652
I don't know.
Mr Prescott?

444
00:40:37,152 --> 00:40:39,621
I'm sorry this came in so
late, but it just arrived.

445
00:40:39,738 --> 00:40:41,115
It's about time!

446
00:40:47,662 --> 00:40:49,414
- This isn't the men's room.
- No.

447
00:40:49,497 --> 00:40:52,376
They took the urinals out last week.
I didn't like them.

448
00:40:52,459 --> 00:40:54,837
How about a paper cup?

449
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:55,920
What?

450
00:40:56,004 --> 00:40:58,473
Sorry. I'm just about the only
woman executive at Pemrose.

451
00:40:58,548 --> 00:41:01,677
Some days, I have a chip
about the men's room.

452
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,012
Sorry.

453
00:41:04,179 --> 00:41:06,102
Hey, nice office.

454
00:41:06,181 --> 00:41:09,355
Nice furniture.
It goes with your hair.

455
00:41:10,018 --> 00:41:13,067
Thank you. I like your suit.
It goes nicely with your nose.

456
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,192
Well.

457
00:41:19,736 --> 00:41:22,205
This conversation
isn't going very well.

458
00:41:22,906 --> 00:41:27,286
Thank you. There's enough talk in
the world already. Good morning.

459
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:32,545
That meant "good-bye."

460
00:41:36,211 --> 00:41:37,804
I have work.

461
00:41:42,091 --> 00:41:45,015
Sorry.
I have a lot of work myself.

462
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:51,484
Good morning.

463
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,159
I really swept her
off her feet.

464
00:42:19,462 --> 00:42:22,932
Nice furniture.
It goes with your hair.

465
00:42:27,554 --> 00:42:31,229
Hello. This is
Carlton Whitfield, 4319.

466
00:42:31,766 --> 00:42:35,145
That's right. I'm still waiting for that
secretary I requested last week.

467
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:39,820
I realize you're
busy down there...

468
00:42:39,899 --> 00:42:42,368
but I'm typing my own letters
and answering my own calls...

469
00:42:42,443 --> 00:42:44,445
and it's getting to be a pain.

470
00:42:45,321 --> 00:42:46,789
Empty?

471
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:51,290
Well, I've been here a week,
got my name on the door...

472
00:42:51,411 --> 00:42:54,130
got a desk full of supplies and
a geranium on my window ledge.

473
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:56,549
What I don't have
is a secretary.

474
00:42:58,084 --> 00:43:00,052
Okay, I'll tell you what.

475
00:43:00,128 --> 00:43:03,598
I'll have Personnel send a boy up from
the mailroom with the requisitions.

476
00:43:03,715 --> 00:43:07,595
Just send me my secretary, okay?
Thank you very much.

477
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:27,618
Got a memo here. Big cheese in 4319
wants his new secretary pronto.

478
00:43:27,697 --> 00:43:29,699
I got a memo here that's
burning up my fingers.

479
00:43:29,782 --> 00:43:34,333
New suit in 4319 wants his personalized
memos and stationery immediately.

480
00:43:34,334 --> 00:43:36,252
- This guy is hot.
- Who?

481
00:43:36,372 --> 00:43:38,295
I don't know.
Name's on the memo.

482
00:43:38,374 --> 00:43:41,924
He wants nameplates for his door,
and he wants it by noon. Okay?

483
00:43:42,003 --> 00:43:43,425
Smile.

484
00:43:47,717 --> 00:43:50,812
- You're late.
- I already done my rounds.

485
00:43:50,887 --> 00:43:52,560
You didn't punch in.

486
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:56,519
Well, I couldn't wait to get to it.
Boy, I love my work.

487
00:43:56,643 --> 00:44:00,443
Punch in, then run this up to
Personnel and wait for an answer.

488
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:02,068
Right.

489
00:44:22,835 --> 00:44:25,588
I'm Jean, your secretary.

490
00:44:25,672 --> 00:44:27,595
I'm not wearing anything.

491
00:44:27,674 --> 00:44:30,143
I see that.

492
00:44:30,551 --> 00:44:32,553
It was warm.

493
00:44:33,596 --> 00:44:36,475
Seems cooler now.
I'll get dressed.

494
00:44:37,725 --> 00:44:41,070
Yes, sir.
I'll move my stuff in.

495
00:44:41,229 --> 00:44:43,607
Great, Jean.
Good idea.

496
00:44:57,412 --> 00:44:59,380
Jean? I have
some notes here.

497
00:44:59,455 --> 00:45:02,379
I also have some charts,
some graphs, some tapes.

498
00:45:02,458 --> 00:45:04,961
They're all sorted by department.
Can you read my handwriting?

499
00:45:05,044 --> 00:45:06,796
- Sort of.
- Do your best.

500
00:45:06,921 --> 00:45:09,674
I need some poster boards, coloured
pencils, coloured push pins...

501
00:45:09,757 --> 00:45:14,354
T square, drawing table, lots of
pencils, and my lunch. Chinese?

502
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:20,105
- Hey, 4319?
- Yeah.

503
00:45:24,397 --> 00:45:25,944
Great.

504
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:29,448
- Morning.
- Morning.

505
00:45:35,074 --> 00:45:37,668
- Morning.
- Hi.

506
00:46:57,406 --> 00:47:00,205
Hello again.
Small world.

507
00:47:01,369 --> 00:47:03,212
Hello.

508
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,298
Are you standing still
for some purpose?

509
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:16,760
Hey, I'm just soaking up
the atmosphere.

510
00:47:19,095 --> 00:47:21,268
Executive lounge, huh?

511
00:47:21,347 --> 00:47:24,565
- Care to do a little lounging?
- No, I'm busy.

512
00:47:24,566 --> 00:47:27,779
Ron, did you get those figures
on transfer costs and insurance?

513
00:47:27,854 --> 00:47:30,824
Not yet.
Big delay in Chicago.

514
00:47:30,898 --> 00:47:34,027
- Damn! I really need them!
- Blame Chicago.

515
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:36,112
- Maybe I can help.
- I'm sorry?

516
00:47:36,195 --> 00:47:37,993
Transfer costs
and insurance for what?

517
00:47:38,072 --> 00:47:40,791
By the time I explained,
I could find out myself.

518
00:47:41,284 --> 00:47:43,286
Ron.
Big weenie.

519
00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:46,168
Hey, listen. Why don't you
explain it to me over lunch?

520
00:47:46,247 --> 00:47:49,626
- I'll have the answer by dessert.
- I don't eat lunch.

521
00:47:50,918 --> 00:47:53,467
Why don't we start this again?
Carlton Whitfield. And you're?

522
00:47:53,588 --> 00:47:55,590
Annoyed.
Shit.

523
00:47:56,883 --> 00:48:00,260
You know, I'm just
trying to be friendly.

524
00:48:00,261 --> 00:48:03,606
You picked a bad time. I was counting
on those figures from Ron.

525
00:48:03,723 --> 00:48:05,771
- Christy Wills. How do you do?
- Good.

526
00:48:06,434 --> 00:48:09,233
Terrible news.
Just awful!

527
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:12,023
Conference room, everybody.
Come on. On the double.

528
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:17,863
- You don't eat lunch. Do you eat dinner?
- Occasionally.

529
00:48:17,945 --> 00:48:19,572
- Tonight?
- Booked.

530
00:48:19,655 --> 00:48:22,033
- Tomorrow night?
- Booked.

531
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:24,995
All right, but don't beg, okay?
It's embarrassing.

532
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:32,093
Who are you?

533
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:37,173
Carlton Whitfield.
New employee.

534
00:48:40,218 --> 00:48:42,687
I didn't get a memo on that.

535
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:44,396
You will.

536
00:48:44,472 --> 00:48:48,022
All right.
As long as I get the memo.

537
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:56,360
The absolute worst has happened.
We are the target of a corporate raid.

538
00:48:56,442 --> 00:49:00,447
Donald Davenport
has filed a 13-D.

539
00:49:00,529 --> 00:49:02,497
A 13-D?

540
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:04,575
He's acquired five
percent of the stock...

541
00:49:04,659 --> 00:49:09,460
and this is definitely the beginning of
a hostile takeover of our corporation.

542
00:49:09,538 --> 00:49:12,667
I think we all know what happened the
last time Davenport took over a company.

543
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,343
Everyone was canned!

544
00:49:15,503 --> 00:49:18,677
Mr Prescott has sent down word
of what he wants us to do.

545
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:22,386
We are to recommend cuts
in every department.

546
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:27,562
Our job is to slash the red ink
in every nook and cranny...

547
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,565
because our company needs
the cash for its defence.

548
00:49:33,521 --> 00:49:35,819
Anybody wanna fire
the first shot?

549
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:38,860
Kill Toledo.

550
00:49:41,946 --> 00:49:43,994
If we close down
our distribution centres...

551
00:49:44,073 --> 00:49:45,871
in Toledo, Joplin, Jacksonville...

552
00:49:45,992 --> 00:49:48,370
we'll slash the red ink
completely off the books.

553
00:49:51,414 --> 00:49:53,837
Whitfield, you don't have to
raise your hand. Just speak.

554
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:55,634
Thank you.

555
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:59,212
Well, I know I'm new here
and everything.

556
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:01,386
On the surface, these cuts
seem like a good idea...

557
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,138
"Seem like a good idea"?

558
00:50:03,259 --> 00:50:05,728
But closing down those distribution
centres would be a big mistake.

559
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:09,307
It so happens that those closings
are exactly what Mr Prescott wants.

560
00:50:10,224 --> 00:50:12,727
Well, then Mr Prescott hasn't
thought things through very well.

561
00:50:13,644 --> 00:50:16,397
I'm going to tell him you said that.

562
00:50:16,897 --> 00:50:19,070
Good. Closing down
those centres...

563
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,448
will put a strain on
this company's cash position.

564
00:50:21,527 --> 00:50:24,701
In the long run, those cuts are going
to hurt this company's innate value.

565
00:50:24,702 --> 00:50:28,122
Innate value?
What is he talking about?

566
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,999
Davidson here will back me up
on this. Davidson?

567
00:50:31,078 --> 00:50:32,671
I'm Proctor.
He's Davidson.

568
00:50:32,788 --> 00:50:34,790
Well, damn it,
Davidson, tell him!

569
00:50:34,874 --> 00:50:37,593
You wrote a memo to Mr Thomas
explaining what I'm talking about.

570
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:40,046
Well, how did you know
I wrote that memo?

571
00:50:45,801 --> 00:50:47,803
How did I know
you wrote that memo?

572
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:54,360
Who else could write
that memo, Davidson?

573
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:57,780
That memo was famous.

574
00:50:57,855 --> 00:50:59,857
That memo was a masterpiece.

575
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,820
Clear, concise, to the point.
That was the best damn memo I ever read!

576
00:51:04,278 --> 00:51:07,655
In fact, that memo wasn't even a memo.
That memo was literature.

577
00:51:07,656 --> 00:51:09,454
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

578
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:13,037
If you have finished your book report,
could you explain what your point is?

579
00:51:13,162 --> 00:51:16,632
- The point is, we gotta be bold.
- That's my point.

580
00:51:16,707 --> 00:51:19,631
We gotta build.
We gotta expand.

581
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:22,509
Expanding is the only way
to help the situation.

582
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:24,598
We gotta make this
company so damn strong...

583
00:51:24,673 --> 00:51:28,018
Davenport won't be able to find anyone
willing to give up Pemrose stock.

584
00:51:28,094 --> 00:51:31,268
It'll be too damn valuable.
Then we'll buy his ass out!

585
00:51:37,103 --> 00:51:39,606
- How old are you, Mister...
- Whitfield.

586
00:51:39,772 --> 00:51:41,774
- Yes.
- Twenty-four.

587
00:51:41,857 --> 00:51:44,406
I think you should keep quiet
until you're at least 25.

588
00:51:45,361 --> 00:51:48,991
If I may, I don't think Whitfield's
age should be an issue here.

589
00:51:49,115 --> 00:51:52,119
No one is interested
in your opinion, Davis.

590
00:51:52,201 --> 00:51:54,579
We gotta block that takeover.

591
00:51:54,662 --> 00:51:56,664
I'm too old to look
for another job.

592
00:51:56,747 --> 00:51:58,875
Nobody in their right mind
would hire me.

593
00:52:02,545 --> 00:52:06,391
This meeting is going nowhere!

594
00:52:06,507 --> 00:52:09,056
Mr Prescott's command stands!

595
00:52:09,135 --> 00:52:12,355
We are to find those cuts!

596
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,273
Meeting adjourned.

597
00:52:19,478 --> 00:52:22,277
You'll pick up the coats.
That looks like one only a lot smaller.

598
00:52:22,356 --> 00:52:24,950
Hey! Harvard!
Where the hell've you been?

599
00:52:25,025 --> 00:52:29,326
Personnel. You said to wait for
an answer. They are real slow up there.

600
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:33,080
There's something going on
around here, Foster.

601
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:36,584
I'm gonna be on you like a rash.
You got that? Like a rash.

602
00:52:36,704 --> 00:52:39,924
Won't the other guys get jealous?
Heads!

603
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,715
You guys were good tonight.

604
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:26,985
Oh, God.
What are you doin' here?

605
00:54:27,064 --> 00:54:30,364
Brantley, darling, I heard you calling
me telepathically... I'm very psychic...

606
00:54:30,442 --> 00:54:32,536
so of course
I rushed right over.

607
00:54:34,113 --> 00:54:38,334
- I would've used the phone.
- Mental telepathy's much more reliable.

608
00:54:39,994 --> 00:54:42,042
Aren't you gonna ask me in?

609
00:54:44,707 --> 00:54:47,301
Yeah. Sorry.

610
00:54:47,376 --> 00:54:49,128
Just a minute.

611
00:54:59,722 --> 00:55:02,225
Father used to live like this
before he founded Pemrose.

612
00:55:02,391 --> 00:55:04,143
Aunt Vera...

613
00:55:04,226 --> 00:55:07,526
I had a hell of a day,
and I really have to get some sleep.

614
00:55:08,731 --> 00:55:11,280
Brantley, you're a young man.

615
00:55:12,443 --> 00:55:14,912
Young men have lots of energy.

616
00:55:18,032 --> 00:55:19,204
Look.

617
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:23,834
- We have a problem.
- What?

618
00:55:25,164 --> 00:55:28,168
Your husband is my boss.

619
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:31,424
Oh, him.
We won't tell him.

620
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:35,137
Besides,
Howard's working late tonight.

621
00:55:35,257 --> 00:55:37,931
On whom, I have no idea.

622
00:55:39,386 --> 00:55:42,560
You look very beautiful
tonight, Christy.

623
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,315
Thank you. Now, there are some
business things we should discuss.

624
00:55:46,435 --> 00:55:49,939
Do you think that this restaurant
has an upstairs with beds in it?

625
00:55:50,022 --> 00:55:52,445
Howard, please!

626
00:55:52,524 --> 00:55:55,994
I don't feel altogether good
about what's happened between us.

627
00:55:56,695 --> 00:55:58,993
You are married.

628
00:55:59,073 --> 00:56:01,792
- I'm not married.
- You are married!

629
00:56:01,867 --> 00:56:05,917
Well, yeah, I am married,
but she and I have an understanding.

630
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:28,811
- I love you.
- I don't really think so.

631
00:56:28,977 --> 00:56:32,322
Well, then I lust after you.
That oughta be worth something.

632
00:56:32,398 --> 00:56:34,776
To you, perhaps.
Now, let's talk business.

633
00:56:34,858 --> 00:56:37,281
I pitched the need for cutbacks
at the meeting today...

634
00:56:37,361 --> 00:56:40,579
but a dissenting opinion was offered
by Carlton Whitfield.

635
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:43,371
Who's Carlton Whitfield?
I didn't hire any Carlton Whitfield.

636
00:56:43,492 --> 00:56:45,039
Somebody did.

637
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:48,293
- Oh, my God. Donald Davenport.
- What?

638
00:56:48,372 --> 00:56:51,501
He may be a plant for Davenport,
gathering information on the takeover.

639
00:56:51,583 --> 00:56:55,383
It's just like him. I want you
to get close to this guy Whitfield.

640
00:56:55,462 --> 00:56:57,180
Find out what he's up to.

641
00:56:57,256 --> 00:57:00,430
- You want me to spy on him?
- No, I don't want you to spy on him.

642
00:57:00,509 --> 00:57:02,477
I want you to get
to be friends with him...

643
00:57:02,553 --> 00:57:04,555
then rifle through his papers
and tell me what you find.

644
00:57:04,638 --> 00:57:06,515
That's spying, Howard.

645
00:57:06,598 --> 00:57:09,647
Look, you have got to drop
this incessant innocence.

646
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:13,698
Life is harsh and ugly,
and only the strong survive.

647
00:57:13,772 --> 00:57:15,866
Or didn't they teach you that
at Harvard?

648
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:22,452
- What you got in there?
- My lunch.

649
00:57:22,531 --> 00:57:24,625
Your lunch?
In a briefcase?

650
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:27,453
Yeah.
Ran out of brown bags.

651
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:31,082
One of you guys got
a spare pair of laces?

652
00:57:31,165 --> 00:57:33,588
Hey, man, I had a babe last night
you wouldn't believe.

653
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:38,218
"Ta-Na's" out to here, man.
She was fine. Where'd he go?

654
00:57:55,731 --> 00:57:58,530
- Coming through. Excuse me.
- Take it easy. Come on.

655
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:00,782
Sorry.

656
00:58:32,267 --> 00:58:34,019
- What a nightmare.
- Stuck again?

657
00:58:34,102 --> 00:58:36,230
- I'm all right, though. I'm fine.
- You okay?

658
00:58:36,313 --> 00:58:40,363
- You all right?
- Don't worry about me. Thanks.

659
00:58:40,442 --> 00:58:44,743
Jean, transcribe these notes. There's
some things on there I need right away.

660
00:58:45,364 --> 00:58:48,368
Make copies of this,
copies of this.

661
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:50,828
- Did you get those supplies I needed?
- Yes, sir.

662
00:58:50,911 --> 00:58:54,006
Good.
I'll be back later.

663
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,672
- Gentlemen.
- Good morning.

664
00:59:10,264 --> 00:59:13,108
- Goddam that thing!
- This thing stuck again?

665
00:59:16,436 --> 00:59:18,313
These elevators are stuck again?

666
00:59:20,858 --> 00:59:24,158
I'm sick and tired of these
elevators always gettin' stuck.

667
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:35,214
Hi, Jean. Will you take
those to the cleaners?

668
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:01,069
These are some of the notes
I found in Whitfield's office.

669
01:00:01,148 --> 01:00:04,197
If you want anything more,
you can go after it yourself.

670
01:00:04,443 --> 01:00:06,571
Do you think he's working
for Davenport?

671
01:00:06,653 --> 01:00:10,829
I have no idea.
I'm out of the spy business.

672
01:00:15,787 --> 01:00:18,666
We can't wait for Whitfield
any longer. Let's get started.

673
01:00:19,291 --> 01:00:23,044
Davis here has prepared what I'm sure
is a thoroughly incompetent analysis...

674
01:00:23,045 --> 01:00:25,548
but let's listen to him read it
before we start criticizing.

675
01:00:25,631 --> 01:00:27,599
Fine. I won't read it at all.
Is that all right?

676
01:00:27,674 --> 01:00:30,723
You have a bad attitude, and I am
gonna tell Mr Prescott about it.

677
01:00:30,802 --> 01:00:33,351
Does anybody else
have anything to say?

678
01:00:35,557 --> 01:00:38,310
Hi. Sorry, I'm late.

679
01:00:38,393 --> 01:00:40,566
Sorry.
Hi, everybody.

680
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:43,569
Casual attire today, Whitfield?

681
01:00:45,901 --> 01:00:47,653
Yeah, trousers, yeah.

682
01:00:47,778 --> 01:00:50,782
New product line.
Testing 'em out. Pretty good.

683
01:00:50,864 --> 01:00:53,367
- Good fabric.
- Good idea.

684
01:00:53,909 --> 01:00:56,583
- Christy, you have something to say.
- Yes.

685
01:00:56,662 --> 01:00:59,632
I came up with some more cuts
in the Middle States area.

686
01:00:59,706 --> 01:01:01,549
Let me pass these out.

687
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:05,004
Why can't you be
more like her, Davis?

688
01:01:06,171 --> 01:01:09,050
Mr Prescott!
Well, what a surprise!

689
01:01:10,217 --> 01:01:13,560
Art, I haven't received
the full report on the cutbacks yet...

690
01:01:13,561 --> 01:01:16,147
so I thought I'd drop in
and see what the problem is.

691
01:01:16,264 --> 01:01:19,188
No problem.
No, sir. Everything is tip-top.

692
01:01:19,267 --> 01:01:21,565
Whitfield has pointed out
a few wrinkles...

693
01:01:21,645 --> 01:01:24,569
and we are going
to iron those wrinkles out.

694
01:01:25,607 --> 01:01:27,701
You don't mind if I stay
for a few minutes, do you?

695
01:01:27,776 --> 01:01:29,528
Yes, sir.

696
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:33,165
- Which one of you is Whitfield?
- Oh, my God!

697
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,164
Nosebleed! Dry heat!
Get 'em all the time!

698
01:01:36,243 --> 01:01:39,042
Oh, God!
No sight for the squeamish.

699
01:01:40,372 --> 01:01:42,081
Who was that?

700
01:01:42,082 --> 01:01:44,380
Well, that's the new boy, Whitfield.

701
01:01:53,385 --> 01:01:54,637
Sorry.

702
01:01:55,345 --> 01:01:57,143
Needed some supplies.

703
01:01:57,222 --> 01:01:59,520
Well, back to business.

704
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,228
A few of these, and...

705
01:02:03,311 --> 01:02:04,984
Oh, God!

706
01:02:05,856 --> 01:02:08,405
You're from Receiving,
aren't you?

707
01:02:09,317 --> 01:02:11,445
<i>I see you're a workaholic.</i>

708
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:16,958
Yeah, well...

709
01:02:18,618 --> 01:02:20,746
I got a lot of work to do.

710
01:02:22,664 --> 01:02:26,794
- What are you doing here so late?
- I'm a workaholic too.

711
01:02:27,294 --> 01:02:29,797
Wow. You mean we have
something in common?

712
01:02:32,507 --> 01:02:36,683
So, what's all this
supposed to be?

713
01:02:36,762 --> 01:02:41,186
It's the heart and soul of an idea
you hated: expansion in the Midwest.

714
01:02:41,187 --> 01:02:43,481
I don't hate it.
I just think it's risky.

715
01:02:43,643 --> 01:02:45,611
Furthermore,
Mr Prescott doesn't want it.

716
01:02:45,687 --> 01:02:48,065
It's a waste of time to pursue it.

717
01:02:49,024 --> 01:02:51,743
But if something's right,
how can it be a waste of time?

718
01:02:51,818 --> 01:02:55,072
There is no right or wrong.
There is only opinion.

719
01:02:57,741 --> 01:03:01,666
You know, in some states,
you can get arrested for saying that.

720
01:03:03,497 --> 01:03:05,920
All right. Convince me.

721
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:09,545
Convince me then that
your opinion is the right one.

722
01:03:10,837 --> 01:03:12,339
All right.

723
01:03:12,881 --> 01:03:16,010
Take a look at this.
And this.

724
01:03:16,676 --> 01:03:19,304
<i>And, yeah.</i>

725
01:03:19,429 --> 01:03:21,727
<i>peruse that.</i>

726
01:03:21,807 --> 01:03:25,059
Why do you keep saying
the exact opposite of what I say?

727
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:28,906
- 'Cause you keep saying stupid things.
- Will you look at these figures?

728
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:31,153
They prove that
the elimination of salaries...

729
01:03:31,233 --> 01:03:33,907
would create a war chest for the
defence of the Pemrose Corporation.

730
01:03:33,985 --> 01:03:36,079
- Can't you see that?
- No, I can't. I'll tell you why.

731
01:03:36,154 --> 01:03:39,283
Closing those factories is just gonna
send a panic through the market.

732
01:03:39,366 --> 01:03:42,870
- That might happen or that might not.
- No, it will happen.

733
01:03:42,994 --> 01:03:46,715
All right, close the centres, put
thousands of people out of work.

734
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:49,634
You're gonna waste all your profits
on unemployment contributions...

735
01:03:49,709 --> 01:03:52,337
severance pay, union lawsuits.

736
01:03:53,171 --> 01:03:54,844
Are you all right?

737
01:03:54,923 --> 01:03:57,722
- My blood sugar's dropping.
- What?

738
01:03:57,801 --> 01:04:00,224
It's just my mind wandered in
the middle of what you were saying.

739
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:04,024
It means I need food.
Do you wanna get a bite?

740
01:04:04,099 --> 01:04:08,070
- Yeah, come on. I'll buy you dinner.
- No, no, no. Dutch.

741
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:13,867
Just tell me one more time
what your solution is to this crisis.

742
01:04:13,942 --> 01:04:17,822
- We don't cut. We expand.
- I agree.

743
01:04:17,904 --> 01:04:21,249
Expansion is a positive reaction
to the universe.

744
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:23,998
While retraction
or cutting back or pulling off...

745
01:04:24,077 --> 01:04:26,751
Those are all negative forces.

746
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:30,926
I used to be very negative, and
then I took this personality workshop.

747
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:33,302
My whole life turned around.

748
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:36,260
Hiya.
My name's Sheila.

749
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:40,344
You make a good-lookin' couple.
How long you been goin' together?

750
01:04:40,427 --> 01:04:44,102
- About 20 minutes.
- First date, huh? Good luck.

751
01:04:44,181 --> 01:04:46,183
No, we're business colleagues.

752
01:04:46,266 --> 01:04:48,564
Colleagues!
Who needs that?

753
01:04:48,643 --> 01:04:50,862
You should go together.
You look good together.

754
01:04:55,275 --> 01:04:57,118
Did you wanna order?

755
01:04:58,069 --> 01:05:01,869
- Yeah, we need to see some menus.
- Menus! I'm sorry.

756
01:05:02,949 --> 01:05:06,453
I'm studying to be an actress. I'm
a better actress than I am a waitress.

757
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:09,460
Concentration, that's my big problem.
I'll be right back.

758
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:14,004
Well, Sheila's in favour
of expansion.

759
01:05:14,005 --> 01:05:18,303
We should bring her to our next meeting.
Art Thomas would like her a lot.

760
01:05:18,673 --> 01:05:21,301
Sheila is also in favour
of us seeing each other.

761
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:24,763
- Yes, well, Sheila is clearly a nut.
- I heard that.

762
01:05:24,846 --> 01:05:27,144
You should try to be
more positive with your life...

763
01:05:27,265 --> 01:05:29,609
or you're gonna
wind up miserable.

764
01:05:29,684 --> 01:05:31,186
She heard me.

765
01:05:34,856 --> 01:05:38,317
I'm having a nice time.
How 'bout you?

766
01:05:38,318 --> 01:05:40,412
Yes, very nice.

767
01:05:40,487 --> 01:05:42,410
Well, it's pleasant walking.

768
01:05:42,489 --> 01:05:45,083
I mean,
I don't want to imply anything.

769
01:05:46,952 --> 01:05:50,832
About your expansion plan,
I did some checking...

770
01:05:50,914 --> 01:05:55,761
and we can get some tax breaks if we
put up a facility in the Midwest region.

771
01:05:56,503 --> 01:05:58,972
You checked?
Earlier today?

772
01:05:59,047 --> 01:06:00,674
That's great.

773
01:06:00,757 --> 01:06:03,431
The powers that be seem
to want the cutting, but I...

774
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:08,061
I've been trying to stay open
to your ideas... your business ideas.

775
01:06:08,181 --> 01:06:09,854
That's great.

776
01:06:16,147 --> 01:06:18,866
Okay, so you're
open to my business ideas.

777
01:06:18,942 --> 01:06:22,027
Now, how about
my after-work ideas?

778
01:06:22,028 --> 01:06:25,783
Don't push. Yesterday,
I thought you were obnoxious.

779
01:06:28,994 --> 01:06:31,543
You know, a lot of people
start out that way.

780
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,134
- They usually end up gettin' married.
- Don't hold your breath.

781
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:37,927
Come on.

782
01:06:39,671 --> 01:06:42,925
Look, I think you're
secretly crazy about me.

783
01:06:43,008 --> 01:06:46,308
And I think you'd feel a lot better
if you'd just admit it.

784
01:06:47,345 --> 01:06:51,100
Come on. You'll like me.
I'm an acquired taste.

785
01:07:07,866 --> 01:07:11,086
My dad insisted
on buying me this.

786
01:07:12,996 --> 01:07:15,044
A round-trip ticket
back to Kansas.

787
01:07:16,916 --> 01:07:18,918
I almost traded it in
a couple of times.

788
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:21,801
But now, it's kind of a symbol.

789
01:07:21,921 --> 01:07:24,140
The day I use this ticket...

790
01:07:24,841 --> 01:07:26,843
is the day New York
has beaten me.

791
01:07:28,887 --> 01:07:30,889
You know, I just
noticed something.

792
01:07:31,431 --> 01:07:35,311
- You're kind of a mess.
- Thank you.

793
01:07:35,393 --> 01:07:38,567
- Did anybody ever tell you that?
- You're the first.

794
01:07:38,646 --> 01:07:40,990
So what I was wonderin' was...

795
01:07:43,151 --> 01:07:46,362
how you can be so
incredibly beautiful...

796
01:07:46,363 --> 01:07:48,491
and be such a mess?

797
01:07:51,242 --> 01:07:53,745
When two people get involved
on a project together...

798
01:07:53,828 --> 01:07:57,173
there's a danger of getting
emotionally involved.

799
01:07:58,583 --> 01:08:00,426
That would be bad.

800
01:08:00,502 --> 01:08:03,847
They confuse the intensity
of their involvement on the project...

801
01:08:03,922 --> 01:08:06,175
and mistake it
as a relationship.

802
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:12,930
- What are you, a shrink?
- It's happened to me.

803
01:08:12,931 --> 01:08:15,229
It's actually still happening
to me, I guess.

804
01:08:15,308 --> 01:08:17,606
And then...

805
01:08:17,685 --> 01:08:21,155
the project ends and they find
they don't have anything to talk about.

806
01:08:22,649 --> 01:08:25,323
Okay, it's settled then.

807
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:30,745
We won't get involved while
we're working on this project.

808
01:08:32,826 --> 01:08:34,373
Right.

809
01:08:42,085 --> 01:08:44,304
So who is he?

810
01:08:44,379 --> 01:08:45,756
Who?

811
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:48,763
Who?
My competition.

812
01:08:48,842 --> 01:08:50,515
Just a guy.

813
01:08:51,636 --> 01:08:53,855
All right, so why don't
we call this guy?

814
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,932
Tell him you met a new guy.
The whole thing is off.

815
01:08:56,015 --> 01:08:59,770
- I can't call him.
- Why not?

816
01:08:59,853 --> 01:09:02,231
His wife might answer
the phone.

817
01:09:04,732 --> 01:09:07,360
- Big mistake.
- Yeah, well, let's not talk about it.

818
01:09:07,444 --> 01:09:10,414
- I've done a lot of stupid things...
- I bet you have.

819
01:09:10,488 --> 01:09:12,240
- But I have never...
- Ever?

820
01:09:14,909 --> 01:09:17,412
Been involved with
a married man.

821
01:09:17,871 --> 01:09:20,545
Well, he was sort of separated
when we started.

822
01:09:23,668 --> 01:09:26,091
Yeah, well, it turned
out to be a lie.

823
01:09:26,171 --> 01:09:28,765
The whole thing was a mistake.

824
01:09:29,883 --> 01:09:32,727
But we live and we learn
and we move on...

825
01:09:47,317 --> 01:09:48,944
That wasn't bad.

826
01:09:50,111 --> 01:09:51,533
Thank you.

827
01:09:53,865 --> 01:09:56,288
Can you do it again
just as good?

828
01:09:59,078 --> 01:10:01,046
I could try.

829
01:11:11,317 --> 01:11:14,161
- Where were you all weekend?
- At least begin with "good morning."

830
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:16,740
I'm madder than hell!

831
01:11:17,782 --> 01:11:20,376
I want to know why
you weren't answering your phone.

832
01:11:20,451 --> 01:11:22,419
I owe a lot to you, Howard.

833
01:11:22,495 --> 01:11:24,873
I'll always be grateful for the chance
you gave me in this company...

834
01:11:25,039 --> 01:11:26,791
and the things I've learned.

835
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:30,587
What is this?
What are you leading up to?

836
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:32,468
<i>I wanna work with you.</i>

837
01:11:32,547 --> 01:11:35,346
<i>I respect you more
than you know, but...</i>

838
01:11:36,259 --> 01:11:39,980
I can't be involved with you
outside the office any more.

839
01:11:42,223 --> 01:11:43,975
Hello?

840
01:11:50,273 --> 01:11:55,029
Yes, I'm looking for the transportation
costs from Toledo dating September...

841
01:11:55,111 --> 01:11:56,909
I'll call you back.

842
01:12:00,283 --> 01:12:03,253
Look, I'm not
gonna pressure you on this.

843
01:12:03,328 --> 01:12:05,205
I want you to take your own time...

844
01:12:06,039 --> 01:12:08,417
and decide what's best for you.

845
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:10,259
Thank you.

846
01:12:12,503 --> 01:12:15,507
I do think the timing's
a little ironic, though.

847
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:18,514
I was gonna tell you
last night...

848
01:12:19,385 --> 01:12:22,730
that Vera and I have agreed
on terms for a divorce.

849
01:12:24,515 --> 01:12:28,236
I only wish that Vera and I
could have worked things out sooner.

850
01:12:28,895 --> 01:12:31,865
That way, you and I
might have had a chance.

851
01:12:34,108 --> 01:12:37,078
This arrived this morning
by messenger.

852
01:12:38,237 --> 01:12:40,740
Davenport has called
an emergency meeting...

853
01:12:40,823 --> 01:12:44,498
of the board of directors
for Monday morning...

854
01:12:44,619 --> 01:12:47,042
and he's offering
to take over the company.

855
01:12:48,748 --> 01:12:52,798
I'm inviting all key personnel to spend
the weekend at my house in Litchfield.

856
01:12:53,628 --> 01:12:55,471
I'd like you to be there too.

857
01:12:56,756 --> 01:12:58,758
Of course I'll be there.

858
01:13:01,052 --> 01:13:04,477
One more question... personal.

859
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:08,818
Just out of curiosity,
who were you with last night?

860
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:13,444
Whitfield.
Carlton Whitfield.

861
01:13:14,774 --> 01:13:18,244
It was all business.
Some of his ideas are brilliant.

862
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:21,744
I'm looking forward to hearing 'em.
I have to talk to him today.

863
01:13:23,533 --> 01:13:27,834
Those notes that I took from Whitfield's
office... I'd like them back, please.

864
01:13:27,912 --> 01:13:30,756
Of course.
I'll get them to you.

865
01:13:30,832 --> 01:13:33,005
Heads up. Thanks.

866
01:13:35,545 --> 01:13:38,839
What's your hurry?
What's goin' on?

867
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:41,218
I got a special delivery
here marked "urgent."

868
01:13:41,342 --> 01:13:43,060
I'm watching you, Foster.

869
01:13:43,136 --> 01:13:44,934
Just remember, every minute...

870
01:13:45,012 --> 01:13:46,980
God is watching you.

871
01:13:48,725 --> 01:13:52,229
Excuse me, Miss, I'm a reporter for the
Times, and I couldn't help noticing...

872
01:13:52,311 --> 01:13:54,405
you look like a woman
who's recently been made love to.

873
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,778
- Not here.
- You weren't made love to here.

874
01:13:56,858 --> 01:13:59,407
Was it anywhere within the New York
State lines, because we usually let...

875
01:13:59,485 --> 01:14:02,409
the philadelphia Gazette
handle Pennsylvania.

876
01:14:04,615 --> 01:14:06,709
What's up?
You seem kind of upset.

877
01:14:06,784 --> 01:14:08,878
I hate men.

878
01:14:08,953 --> 01:14:11,206
Well, I'm glad
I'm not one of 'em.

879
01:14:13,082 --> 01:14:15,176
Listen, there's something
I gotta explain to you.

880
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:19,006
I have something to tell you too.
I did something I wish I hadn't, and...

881
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,507
All right, look.

882
01:14:22,008 --> 01:14:24,477
- This weekend?
- Can't.

883
01:14:24,552 --> 01:14:28,853
- I have some loose ends to tie up.
- Good!

884
01:14:29,056 --> 01:14:32,185
- I'll take care of it.
- Have a nice weekend. See you Monday.

885
01:14:37,565 --> 01:14:39,613
Excuse me, Miss.
I'm sorry. Excuse me!

886
01:14:41,277 --> 01:14:43,279
You didn't see me.
I wasn't here.

887
01:14:47,116 --> 01:14:50,040
- Where is he? Where'd he go?
- I didn't see him. He wasn't here.

888
01:14:59,796 --> 01:15:01,719
You still here?

889
01:15:02,715 --> 01:15:04,388
You look great.

890
01:15:08,179 --> 01:15:10,557
The end of the second lap,
you still got a comfortable lead.

891
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:17,647
Excuse me again.

892
01:15:20,483 --> 01:15:22,110
- Hi, boss.
- Shit!

893
01:15:25,196 --> 01:15:26,743
Bye, boss.

894
01:15:29,951 --> 01:15:31,828
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

895
01:15:31,911 --> 01:15:33,879
Looking for Whitfield.
Got a delivery for him.

896
01:15:33,955 --> 01:15:35,582
Why are you wearing a suit?

897
01:15:37,291 --> 01:15:40,386
- Because of the funeral.
- Whose funeral?

898
01:15:40,461 --> 01:15:43,931
A friend. He died.
We buried him.

899
01:15:44,966 --> 01:15:46,809
What is all this stuff?

900
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,856
Production performance charts
for the Midwest region, I guess.

901
01:15:54,976 --> 01:15:56,444
Where is Whitfield?

902
01:15:57,770 --> 01:15:59,272
He's not here?

903
01:15:59,814 --> 01:16:03,316
- Have you ever seen Whitfield?
- Yes, sir.

904
01:16:03,317 --> 01:16:04,944
Well, lots of times.

905
01:16:05,111 --> 01:16:07,660
I deliver here every day.
Great guy.

906
01:16:08,614 --> 01:16:10,662
How does he get
all this information?

907
01:16:10,741 --> 01:16:14,086
Well, it's available in most
quarterly stock reports...

908
01:16:15,329 --> 01:16:17,002
Probably.

909
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:21,636
- Take this up to my office.
- Yes, sir.

910
01:16:27,675 --> 01:16:30,895
- You're not comin'?
- I'll be there in a minute.

911
01:16:42,481 --> 01:16:44,654
One question:
What the hell are you doin'?

912
01:16:44,734 --> 01:16:47,237
- Having a nervous breakdown.
- No wonder.

913
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:50,164
Look, nothin' good can come from this.
If you get caught, you get canned.

914
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,458
If you don't get caught, you become
one of them... a suit.

915
01:16:52,533 --> 01:16:56,959
- It's a no-win situation.
- I'm still a half a step ahead of them.

916
01:17:08,215 --> 01:17:12,510
<i>I hear music when I look at you</i>

917
01:17:12,511 --> 01:17:15,731
Aunt Vera, hi.
How are you?

918
01:17:17,808 --> 01:17:20,857
<i>I'm in the mood for love</i>

919
01:17:20,937 --> 01:17:24,783
<i>Simply because you're near me</i>

920
01:17:24,857 --> 01:17:27,781
A medley. Gee, that's nice.

921
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:29,908
Why are you singing a medley?

922
01:17:29,987 --> 01:17:33,912
<i>I get no kick from champagne</i>

923
01:17:33,991 --> 01:17:39,839
<i>- Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all</i>
- Please, don't sing any more.

924
01:17:41,207 --> 01:17:42,459
Oh, God!

925
01:17:42,583 --> 01:17:45,336
I haven't sung in years.
You see what you do to me?

926
01:17:45,419 --> 01:17:47,092
He's on his way up.

927
01:17:47,171 --> 01:17:50,766
He's gonna be here any minute.
Why are you doing this?

928
01:17:50,925 --> 01:17:53,599
- I'm going to have you for lunch.
- Can't I get you a ham and cheese?

929
01:17:53,678 --> 01:17:55,680
Look at that
cute little Adam's apple.

930
01:17:56,722 --> 01:17:59,601
Listen. Oh, shit. Since the last time
we met, there's been a change.

931
01:17:59,684 --> 01:18:01,812
Yes, nice suit, Brantley.

932
01:18:02,728 --> 01:18:06,323
Look, what I mean to say is...
Oh, Christ!

933
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:09,068
- I'm not free any more.
- You're gonna charge me?

934
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:11,654
You're getting awfully cynical.
Does your mother know about this?

935
01:18:11,737 --> 01:18:16,117
- No, I mean I'm not available!
- Good, you're not gonna charge me.

936
01:18:16,701 --> 01:18:19,454
Don't worry, Brantley. I don't wanna
marry you. I'm already married.

937
01:18:19,578 --> 01:18:22,081
- I just wanna love you.
- Love.

938
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:25,543
I don't mean love as in two star-crossed
virginettes running through the clover.

939
01:18:25,668 --> 01:18:29,136
Nothing icky like that. I'm a practical
woman. You should be a practical man.

940
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:32,851
If you just let me, I could steer you
through these shark-infested waters...

941
01:18:32,967 --> 01:18:35,390
of this stupid company
just like I steered Howard.

942
01:18:35,469 --> 01:18:38,598
Look, I like you. I really like you.
But I gotta tell you.

943
01:18:38,681 --> 01:18:42,436
I've become seriously and emotionally
involved with someone who isn't my aunt.

944
01:18:43,144 --> 01:18:46,114
- I forgive you, Brantley.
- Listen!

945
01:18:46,522 --> 01:18:49,196
- There is someone else in my life!
- I got it. I don't care.

946
01:18:49,275 --> 01:18:51,243
There's someone else
in my life too.

947
01:18:51,318 --> 01:18:54,367
Maybe we should introduce
your girlfriend and my husband.

948
01:18:54,447 --> 01:18:58,168
Look, I don't wanna get rough with you,
but I'll belt you around if I have to.

949
01:18:58,284 --> 01:19:02,039
Jesus Christ, Vera!
I'm gonna get fired. Gimme a break.

950
01:19:02,121 --> 01:19:04,294
Don't whine, Brantley.
Life is too short.

951
01:19:04,373 --> 01:19:07,798
Before you know it, you'll be 25,
wondering where it all went.

952
01:19:10,963 --> 01:19:13,967
- What the hell is this?
- He fainted.

953
01:19:14,050 --> 01:19:15,302
Fainted?

954
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:20,140
- Dead away.
- Actually, he hit his head.

955
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:23,351
- It was like fainting. Knocked out.
- Hit his head on what?

956
01:19:23,434 --> 01:19:24,902
- The floor.
- The ceiling.

957
01:19:24,903 --> 01:19:26,362
- Which one?
- Both.

958
01:19:26,437 --> 01:19:28,690
- Neither.
- What the hell happened?

959
01:19:28,773 --> 01:19:31,492
Uncle Howard, it was like this.

960
01:19:31,567 --> 01:19:34,036
I walked into your office...

961
01:19:34,779 --> 01:19:37,030
and I saw this beautiful woman...

962
01:19:37,031 --> 01:19:39,282
who I had never seen
before in my life.

963
01:19:39,283 --> 01:19:43,208
And imagine my surprise
when I found out it was my Aunt Vera.

964
01:19:43,287 --> 01:19:47,292
Well, he was so excited,
his blood pressure shot up...

965
01:19:47,374 --> 01:19:49,422
and then he fell and
hit his head on the floor.

966
01:19:49,502 --> 01:19:54,383
Out like a light.
So I crawled deliriously to the sofa.

967
01:19:54,465 --> 01:19:57,059
- And I rushed to his aid.
- And you walked in.

968
01:19:57,218 --> 01:20:01,439
And shame on you for not telling me
our nephew's working for the company.

969
01:20:01,514 --> 01:20:03,312
Our nephew works
for the company.

970
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:05,267
I've got a million things
to take care of today.

971
01:20:05,351 --> 01:20:07,319
- Why are you here?
- Lunch.

972
01:20:07,394 --> 01:20:10,489
- We were supposed to have lunch.
- I've had my lunch.

973
01:20:10,564 --> 01:20:14,364
- You don't seem to realize...
- I do realize, Howard.

974
01:20:14,443 --> 01:20:17,743
So, you won't mind if Brantley and I go
out to lunch to get better acquainted?

975
01:20:17,822 --> 01:20:21,908
- Fine.
- I can't. I gotta go to a funeral.

976
01:20:21,909 --> 01:20:24,128
You said you already went.

977
01:20:25,788 --> 01:20:28,462
You know, in my grief, I forgot.

978
01:20:31,168 --> 01:20:34,593
Why don't we bring Brantley out
to the house this weekend for the party?

979
01:20:34,672 --> 01:20:36,515
I mean, he is family.

980
01:20:37,675 --> 01:20:41,555
Yes, you know, that might be
a very good idea.

981
01:20:41,637 --> 01:20:43,685
No, I don't think
I'd fit in, Aunt Vera.

982
01:20:43,764 --> 01:20:46,483
But you do fit in, Brantley.

983
01:20:46,559 --> 01:20:48,653
I'll make sure he has
a wonderful time.

984
01:20:48,727 --> 01:20:52,732
All right. It's settled.
Now, can I get back to work here?

985
01:20:54,024 --> 01:20:56,573
It'll be nice to have
a playmate for the weekend.

986
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:10,170
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Oh, yeah, Brantley.

987
01:21:10,249 --> 01:21:13,799
I want you to know I've been
watching you very closely lately.

988
01:21:13,878 --> 01:21:17,633
- You have?
- I know everything you've been up to.

989
01:21:18,591 --> 01:21:20,935
- You do?
- Everything.

990
01:21:22,595 --> 01:21:26,600
Sir, I can explain this.
See, I didn't know who that was...

991
01:21:26,682 --> 01:21:29,481
I know, for example, that you've
been working hard in the mailroom.

992
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:31,688
You've kept your eyes open
and your nose clean.

993
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:33,647
You stayed out of trouble.

994
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,193
I'm gonna reward you for that
one of these days.

995
01:21:38,068 --> 01:21:41,663
But first I'd like to ask
a favour of you.

996
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,867
You name it, sir.

997
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:47,294
We'll talk about it
while we work out.

998
01:21:49,038 --> 01:21:51,461
You like to sweat,
don't you, Brantley?

999
01:21:57,087 --> 01:22:00,307
Your Aunt Vera seems to have
taken an instant liking to you.

1000
01:22:02,301 --> 01:22:05,225
- I hadn't noticed.
- It's obvious.

1001
01:22:05,304 --> 01:22:08,604
I think she'd like to get
to know you a lot better.

1002
01:22:08,682 --> 01:22:10,480
I want to encourage that.

1003
01:22:11,101 --> 01:22:13,900
I'd like you to spend
lots of time with Aunt Vera...

1004
01:22:13,979 --> 01:22:16,027
at the party this weekend.

1005
01:22:17,983 --> 01:22:22,363
Men like us can't be locked in
to one woman, Brantley.

1006
01:22:22,446 --> 01:22:26,872
We need variety.
Keeps us young, energetic, competitive.

1007
01:22:26,992 --> 01:22:31,372
You get my meaning? Of course you do.
We're men of the world, right?

1008
01:22:31,373 --> 01:22:34,000
Now, a problem has developed.

1009
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:37,804
- I have a friend, a companion...
- A girl.

1010
01:22:38,379 --> 01:22:41,303
She's been getting
a little antsy lately.

1011
01:22:41,382 --> 01:22:43,180
Wants me to leave my wife.

1012
01:22:43,259 --> 01:22:46,934
Well, I'm not about to leave my wife...
not for her, not for anyone.

1013
01:22:47,012 --> 01:22:50,607
I just need a little time to get
the situation under control again.

1014
01:22:50,683 --> 01:22:53,357
- Understand?
- Not altogether.

1015
01:22:53,477 --> 01:22:55,855
Well, I'm inviting her out
to the party this weekend...

1016
01:22:55,938 --> 01:22:58,441
and we're gonna spend
a little time together...

1017
01:22:58,565 --> 01:23:01,034
which is why I need you
to keep your Aunt Vera...

1018
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:03,829
occupied as much as possible.

1019
01:23:03,904 --> 01:23:06,282
- Get the picture?
- Yeah, wide-screen.

1020
01:23:06,365 --> 01:23:10,038
- But I got some big plans this weekend.
- Fine. I won't forget this favour.

1021
01:23:10,039 --> 01:23:13,005
- No, you don't understand. See...
- Great. It's all settled then.

1022
01:23:13,747 --> 01:23:17,172
I've got my eye out for some rapid
advancement for you, Brantley.

1023
01:23:17,251 --> 01:23:21,222
You seem to be a young man
with a lot on the ball. Keep it up.

1024
01:23:25,384 --> 01:23:27,057
Schmuck.

1025
01:23:30,556 --> 01:23:32,775
That's nice.

1026
01:23:33,809 --> 01:23:38,155
Excuse me. Brantley, darling,
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

1027
01:23:42,067 --> 01:23:45,412
I'm going to introduce you to the most
powerful money men in New York.

1028
01:23:45,487 --> 01:23:47,364
If you can do to them
what you've done to me...

1029
01:23:47,448 --> 01:23:50,452
- I can't do that.
- I mean bowl them over, darling.

1030
01:23:50,534 --> 01:23:53,629
You're irresistible
when you turn on that boyish charm.

1031
01:23:53,704 --> 01:23:56,253
- Hi, Whitfield.
- Whitfield?

1032
01:23:56,332 --> 01:23:58,334
Yeah, it's my middle name.
Brantley Whitfield...

1033
01:23:58,417 --> 01:24:00,385
- Hi, Carlton.
- Carlton Foster.

1034
01:24:00,461 --> 01:24:03,590
- You go by all those names?
- Yeah, I got a lot of 'em.

1035
01:24:03,672 --> 01:24:07,518
My parents couldn't make up their mind.
My monogram looks like an eye chart.

1036
01:24:08,093 --> 01:24:11,939
You're always surprising me, Brantley.
That's your most attractive quality.

1037
01:24:12,973 --> 01:24:15,351
Promise me you'll never stop.

1038
01:24:17,144 --> 01:24:19,897
- I promise.
- Good. Now.

1039
01:24:19,980 --> 01:24:23,655
Roland Owens, First Federal.
Very rich. We start with him.

1040
01:24:23,734 --> 01:24:26,487
He made his money
the really old-fashioned way.

1041
01:24:26,570 --> 01:24:28,538
He inherited it.

1042
01:24:28,614 --> 01:24:30,616
And see the man playing tennis
with the elbow brace...

1043
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:32,326
the knee strap and the glove?

1044
01:24:32,409 --> 01:24:35,583
Vernon S. Fletcher,
Wall Street's iron man.

1045
01:24:35,662 --> 01:24:39,587
If he likes you, you can write
your own ticket, and he'll like you.

1046
01:24:39,666 --> 01:24:41,668
Who's the tall guy
with all the girls?

1047
01:24:41,752 --> 01:24:45,507
Good eye, Brantley. Harley
McMasters, First Multinational.

1048
01:24:45,631 --> 01:24:50,478
Recently divorced. They're all dying to
be the second Mrs First Multinational.

1049
01:24:50,969 --> 01:24:55,440
Listen, you're not gonna tell anybody
I work in the mailroom, are ya?

1050
01:24:55,599 --> 01:24:57,317
Trust me, Brantley.

1051
01:24:57,393 --> 01:24:59,612
I got Howard his key
to the executive washroom.

1052
01:24:59,686 --> 01:25:01,688
I can do the same thing for you.

1053
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:09,663
Here are Whitfield's notes.

1054
01:25:12,324 --> 01:25:14,326
- Impressive.
- Thank you.

1055
01:25:16,203 --> 01:25:19,628
This is supposed to be
a business trip, remember?

1056
01:25:19,706 --> 01:25:22,676
Baby, how can I concentrate
on business?

1057
01:25:23,335 --> 01:25:25,303
Howard, let me go!

1058
01:25:34,596 --> 01:25:37,349
What are you doing here?

1059
01:25:38,016 --> 01:25:40,860
Would Carlton Whitfield
miss a party?

1060
01:25:40,936 --> 01:25:44,190
- I'm so glad you're here.
- So am I.

1061
01:25:46,483 --> 01:25:47,860
Quick!

1062
01:25:48,694 --> 01:25:50,412
Stop! Not here!

1063
01:25:54,032 --> 01:25:56,126
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1064
01:25:56,201 --> 01:25:59,125
Wait. I gotta tuck.
You go first. Go first.

1065
01:25:59,204 --> 01:26:02,299
- How do I look?
- Come on. Come on.

1066
01:26:02,374 --> 01:26:05,093
Well, I've had a look
at that preliminary report...

1067
01:26:05,169 --> 01:26:08,673
and I'm satisfied that the proposed
cutbacks are our best line of defence.

1068
01:26:08,797 --> 01:26:11,926
Thank you, sir. We have tried
to cut hard and to cut deep.

1069
01:26:12,009 --> 01:26:16,389
- Yes. The job was adequately done.
- Thank you, sir.

1070
01:26:16,472 --> 01:26:19,191
I think Whitfield is right,
and this report is wrong.

1071
01:28:04,037 --> 01:28:07,132
- Have you seen Christy?
- No, I haven't, sir. Not for a while.

1072
01:28:10,127 --> 01:28:13,131
- Have you seen Christy?
- Sorry. No, I haven't.

1073
01:28:15,674 --> 01:28:17,972
- Jack.
- Yes, Howard.

1074
01:28:18,051 --> 01:28:19,803
Have you seen Christy Wills?

1075
01:28:19,886 --> 01:28:21,854
She's talking to Whitfield.

1076
01:28:26,351 --> 01:28:29,446
No? Come on.
That's my best... trust me.

1077
01:28:29,521 --> 01:28:31,364
It's my best one.

1078
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,818
Would you excuse us
for a minute, Christy?

1079
01:28:40,574 --> 01:28:43,248
Brantley, did you know
that Whitfield is here?

1080
01:28:43,952 --> 01:28:46,250
Yeah, I think he was
here earlier, but he left.

1081
01:28:46,330 --> 01:28:49,425
No. Somebody saw him
a few minutes ago talking to Christy.

1082
01:28:51,877 --> 01:28:54,211
Now, I've got my reasons.

1083
01:28:54,212 --> 01:28:56,214
I want you to stay
close to Christy...

1084
01:28:56,298 --> 01:28:58,471
and keep Whitfield
away from her.

1085
01:28:58,550 --> 01:29:01,053
Can you do that for me?

1086
01:29:01,178 --> 01:29:03,180
Hey, I'm your man.

1087
01:29:03,263 --> 01:29:06,608
Good. I knew
I could count on you.

1088
01:29:12,397 --> 01:29:14,365
What was that all about?

1089
01:29:14,441 --> 01:29:18,821
Well, he wants me to stay
as close to you as possible.

1090
01:29:19,488 --> 01:29:21,786
- He told you that?
- Yeah.

1091
01:29:23,075 --> 01:29:25,828
I don't know. I guess he thinks
we make a good couple.

1092
01:30:10,288 --> 01:30:11,961
Are you awake?

1093
01:33:04,629 --> 01:33:06,131
Darling?

1094
01:33:48,965 --> 01:33:51,434
Sweetheart, it's Howard.

1095
01:33:51,509 --> 01:33:55,059
- Go away!
- Let's make this a night to remember.

1096
01:33:55,221 --> 01:33:58,316
Darling, I know
you're angry with me...

1097
01:33:58,391 --> 01:34:02,237
but think of all the things
that we've meant to each other.

1098
01:34:03,146 --> 01:34:06,025
I want to marry you, Christy.

1099
01:34:14,032 --> 01:34:15,875
Don't be that way, baby.

1100
01:34:23,041 --> 01:34:26,090
What do you say?
Will you marry me?

1101
01:34:26,169 --> 01:34:28,672
No, but I'd like
to beat the shit outta you!

1102
01:34:35,261 --> 01:34:37,059
Wait till I get my...

1103
01:34:41,309 --> 01:34:42,777
Who is that?

1104
01:34:43,895 --> 01:34:45,897
Oh, my God!

1105
01:34:46,690 --> 01:34:48,192
Oh, my God!

1106
01:34:48,274 --> 01:34:51,778
The sexual revolution is over.
Everybody, out of bed.

1107
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:55,828
What are you doing in
Christy's bed, Brantley?

1108
01:34:55,907 --> 01:34:58,285
- I'm talking to you, Howard.
- Who's Brantley?

1109
01:34:58,451 --> 01:35:02,251
Brantley is the guy who just found
his stolen notes in your bag.

1110
01:35:02,330 --> 01:35:06,460
Those are Whitfield's notes, and they
are not stolen. He gave them to me.

1111
01:35:06,543 --> 01:35:10,013
You were so grateful to him, you climbed
into bed and asked him to marry you.

1112
01:35:10,088 --> 01:35:12,637
What are you talking about?
I climbed into bed with you.

1113
01:35:12,757 --> 01:35:13,966
Baloney!

1114
01:35:13,967 --> 01:35:15,890
You thought you were
climbing into bed with her.

1115
01:35:15,969 --> 01:35:19,064
Wait. When I came in,
he was in bed with Whitfield.

1116
01:35:19,139 --> 01:35:21,267
Whitfield?
He wasn't even here.

1117
01:35:21,349 --> 01:35:23,818
- Are you blind? Who's that?
- That's Brantley.

1118
01:35:24,978 --> 01:35:28,073
So this is the bimbo you've been
screwing around with at the office?

1119
01:35:28,148 --> 01:35:31,446
- Who are you calling a bimbo?
- If the shoe fits...

1120
01:35:31,447 --> 01:35:33,411
What's that supposed to mean?

1121
01:35:33,486 --> 01:35:35,705
Why didn't you ask for those?
I would have given 'em to you.

1122
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:38,750
I was gonna tell you about that.
It happened before I really knew you.

1123
01:35:38,825 --> 01:35:42,955
So when we were in bed, that whole
thing was James Bond time, right?

1124
01:35:43,038 --> 01:35:46,383
- No!
- You went to bed with Brantley?

1125
01:35:46,458 --> 01:35:50,304
Don't worry, Howard. She's probably got
microfilm pictures of the whole thing.

1126
01:35:50,378 --> 01:35:52,346
What were you doing
in bed with my nephew?

1127
01:35:52,422 --> 01:35:55,175
- Whitfield's your nephew?
- This is Brantley Foster.

1128
01:35:55,258 --> 01:35:57,010
He works in the mailroom.

1129
01:35:57,093 --> 01:35:59,562
The mailroom?
You mean you're not an executive?

1130
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:03,559
Let me get this straight.
Brantley is Whitfield?

1131
01:36:03,641 --> 01:36:05,018
That's right.

1132
01:36:05,101 --> 01:36:07,980
Brantley is Whitfield.
Whitfield is Brantley.

1133
01:36:08,063 --> 01:36:09,531
And Christy is the bimbo.

1134
01:36:09,689 --> 01:36:12,488
Well, now that we've had
Mouseketeer roll call...

1135
01:36:12,567 --> 01:36:14,911
I'm just going to go
call my lawyer.

1136
01:36:15,028 --> 01:36:18,496
Wait. Christy is not the bimbo I was
screwing around with at the office.

1137
01:36:18,497 --> 01:36:20,288
People better stop
calling me "bimbo."

1138
01:36:20,366 --> 01:36:22,084
It was an entirely
different bimbo.

1139
01:36:22,160 --> 01:36:24,834
That's fine. How many
bimbos would you say there were?

1140
01:36:24,996 --> 01:36:28,296
I misspoke myself.
There weren't any bimbos at all.

1141
01:36:28,297 --> 01:36:30,760
- Except Christy.
- Right. No!

1142
01:36:32,462 --> 01:36:35,807
The question is, how many people
did you sleep with to get to the top?

1143
01:36:39,344 --> 01:36:42,061
That was a very expensive
vase, you bitch.

1144
01:36:42,062 --> 01:36:46,026
Shut up! Now listen. Whatever I did
was my business, not yours.

1145
01:36:46,027 --> 01:36:48,691
No, you mean it was
company business.

1146
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:52,650
That's right, and that's
all it was: business.

1147
01:36:57,862 --> 01:37:00,285
Let me tell you somethin',
sweetheart.

1148
01:37:02,534 --> 01:37:04,753
You're very good at your job.

1149
01:37:16,965 --> 01:37:19,844
You mean I was workin'
for a guy from the mailroom?

1150
01:37:19,926 --> 01:37:23,100
- You're not an executive?
- He's too good to be an executive.

1151
01:37:24,222 --> 01:37:26,190
- Disappointed?
- Yes!

1152
01:37:26,266 --> 01:37:28,815
I was having fun on this job.

1153
01:37:28,893 --> 01:37:32,989
You had all this energy,
and all these crazy ideas.

1154
01:37:33,064 --> 01:37:35,158
And you kept takin'
your pants off.

1155
01:37:35,233 --> 01:37:37,531
I don't want you to go.

1156
01:37:38,736 --> 01:37:40,363
Here.

1157
01:37:40,738 --> 01:37:43,036
Just a little somethin'
to remember me by.

1158
01:37:43,825 --> 01:37:47,079
- Thank you.
- Brantley, why you lookin' so sad?

1159
01:37:47,745 --> 01:37:50,498
I don't know. I just thought
it'd work out better, you know?

1160
01:37:50,623 --> 01:37:52,250
The job or the girl?

1161
01:37:53,376 --> 01:37:56,300
The job.
To hell with the girl.

1162
01:37:56,921 --> 01:37:59,891
Yeah.
You sound real convincing.

1163
01:38:00,758 --> 01:38:03,056
Well, look at it this way, pal.

1164
01:38:04,179 --> 01:38:07,934
For a few weeks, you sat up here in
the lofty atmosphere of the big cheeses.

1165
01:38:08,057 --> 01:38:11,857
You had a nice view of Manhattan
and a clean lunchroom to eat in.

1166
01:38:11,936 --> 01:38:15,736
Hell, you did more in two months
than most people do in a lifetime.

1167
01:38:16,733 --> 01:38:18,735
Yeah, I'm gonna miss it.

1168
01:38:19,777 --> 01:38:22,280
The job or the girl?

1169
01:38:30,455 --> 01:38:33,459
- Goin' back to Kansas?
- No, I'm not goin' back to Kansas.

1170
01:38:33,541 --> 01:38:35,259
I came to New York to succeed.

1171
01:38:35,376 --> 01:38:37,424
I hear there's an opening
in the mailroom.

1172
01:38:37,503 --> 01:38:40,427
You should talk.
You're just as unemployed as I am.

1173
01:38:40,506 --> 01:38:42,508
Not for long.
I have contacts all over town.

1174
01:38:42,592 --> 01:38:45,719
- There's always another Prescott around.
- Low blow, Foster. Dirty pool.

1175
01:38:45,720 --> 01:38:48,018
- I call 'em like I see 'em.
- Yeah, you're perfect, right?

1176
01:38:48,139 --> 01:38:50,813
- I never slept with the boss.
- No, you slept with the boss's wife.

1177
01:38:50,892 --> 01:38:52,269
She seduced me.

1178
01:38:52,393 --> 01:38:54,236
He seduced me.
What's the difference?

1179
01:38:54,312 --> 01:38:56,565
I couldn't help it.
You went willingly.

1180
01:38:56,648 --> 01:38:59,527
- I see. You were tied up in chains.
- I'll tell you what the difference is.

1181
01:38:59,609 --> 01:39:01,907
- I thought you were a nice guy.
- I am a nice guy!

1182
01:39:01,986 --> 01:39:03,403
You're a rat!

1183
01:39:03,404 --> 01:39:05,281
You lied to me, deceived me,
then acted as judge and jury...

1184
01:39:05,365 --> 01:39:07,038
in a situation you
knew nothing about.

1185
01:39:07,116 --> 01:39:10,461
- I know you were spying on me.
- I wasn't spying on you!

1186
01:39:10,536 --> 01:39:14,006
- And I won't be spying on you any more!
- No, you won't, 'cause if I see you...

1187
01:39:22,632 --> 01:39:24,930
Sorry.
This car is full.

1188
01:39:30,056 --> 01:39:32,650
- We could never pull that off.
- How do you know?

1189
01:39:32,725 --> 01:39:35,444
I'm a kid from the mailroom who
moved into a top executive position.

1190
01:39:35,561 --> 01:39:37,359
Are you gonna tell me
I can't pull it off?

1191
01:39:37,438 --> 01:39:39,031
But you didn't.

1192
01:39:39,524 --> 01:39:43,028
I almost did.
We could pull this off.

1193
01:39:45,363 --> 01:39:48,617
- I'm gonna need your help, both of you.
- Is it somethin' I could get fired for?

1194
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:50,909
- Absolutely.
- I like it.

1195
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:53,754
Jean, see if you can find Harley
McMasters' phone number.

1196
01:39:53,871 --> 01:39:56,374
And get some food up here.
Chinese sound good to you?

1197
01:39:57,625 --> 01:40:01,380
Mr Davenport, we realize you'll want
to move some of your own people...

1198
01:40:01,462 --> 01:40:05,217
into the medium control
positions here at Pemrose.

1199
01:40:07,635 --> 01:40:08,932
Naturally.

1200
01:40:09,887 --> 01:40:13,812
What we're concerned about, frankly,
is the upper management positions.

1201
01:40:16,519 --> 01:40:19,944
- Most of 'em will have to go.
- Oh, no.

1202
01:40:22,025 --> 01:40:23,572
I see.

1203
01:40:25,653 --> 01:40:28,031
But a handful of 'em...

1204
01:40:29,532 --> 01:40:31,455
who have been so helpful...

1205
01:40:33,536 --> 01:40:35,755
like yourselves, of course...

1206
01:40:36,581 --> 01:40:38,629
will be stayin'
as long as you like.

1207
01:40:40,251 --> 01:40:42,219
Well, then I see nothing
to stand in the way...

1208
01:40:42,295 --> 01:40:44,844
of the immediate merger
of our two companies.

1209
01:40:44,922 --> 01:40:47,971
Is this the place? it is!
Hey, good. Sorry we're late.

1210
01:40:48,051 --> 01:40:51,976
- Get them out of here.
- I'm sorry. This is a private meeting.

1211
01:40:52,055 --> 01:40:55,605
- I have to ask you to leave.
- Hold these, will you? Thanks a lot.

1212
01:40:58,353 --> 01:41:01,152
- Call building security.
- Howard, relax. Listen.

1213
01:41:01,230 --> 01:41:03,324
On behalf of the personnel
in the mailroom...

1214
01:41:03,399 --> 01:41:06,573
the girls in the secretarial pool,
the female executives here at Pemrose...

1215
01:41:06,652 --> 01:41:08,654
we wanted to give our blessing
to this little merger.

1216
01:41:08,738 --> 01:41:12,584
- Who in hell are these people?
- Is that Don? Donny!

1217
01:41:12,658 --> 01:41:16,663
How ya doin'? You mind if I stand up?
I think better when I'm movin' around.

1218
01:41:16,746 --> 01:41:18,544
Gotta tell you, Don...

1219
01:41:18,623 --> 01:41:20,625
at first, the idea of this merger
made me as nervous...

1220
01:41:20,708 --> 01:41:23,632
as a long-tailed cat
in a room full of rocking chairs.

1221
01:41:23,711 --> 01:41:26,009
But then I realized
I was wrong.

1222
01:41:26,130 --> 01:41:29,475
The combination of our products
and your distribution capabilities...

1223
01:41:29,550 --> 01:41:32,679
could vault Pemrose right
to the top of the market.

1224
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:35,807
So glad you approve...

1225
01:41:36,224 --> 01:41:37,817
whoever you are.

1226
01:41:37,892 --> 01:41:40,395
Now if you get the hell out of here,
we'll finish the job.

1227
01:41:40,895 --> 01:41:42,772
I can't do that for you, Don.

1228
01:41:43,648 --> 01:41:45,867
See, the problem here
is management.

1229
01:41:46,859 --> 01:41:49,201
Things were bad enough
when Howard was running the company.

1230
01:41:49,202 --> 01:41:53,496
- Now we got you to deal with too.
- Get them out of here, now.

1231
01:41:53,574 --> 01:41:56,828
He can't, Don. You see,
Brantley made arrangements...

1232
01:41:56,911 --> 01:41:58,913
to buy five percent
of the stock...

1233
01:41:58,996 --> 01:42:01,875
in your company, Davenport
Enterprises, this morning.

1234
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,423
- We're buying you out.
- What?

1235
01:42:05,503 --> 01:42:07,301
Get in there!

1236
01:42:08,256 --> 01:42:10,008
That's right!

1237
01:42:10,675 --> 01:42:13,474
We've initiated a takeover
of Davenport Enterprises...

1238
01:42:13,553 --> 01:42:16,352
in a proxy fight for the
Pemrose Corporation.

1239
01:42:16,472 --> 01:42:20,227
- This way, Mr McMasters.
- Gentlemen, good afternoon.

1240
01:42:20,309 --> 01:42:22,727
These are my
financial advisers.

1241
01:42:22,728 --> 01:42:25,777
They agreed to lend me the money
to finance this takeover.

1242
01:42:25,857 --> 01:42:28,531
Surely you're not going to invest
in some crackpot scheme...

1243
01:42:28,651 --> 01:42:31,994
cooked up by a kid who used
to work in our mailroom.

1244
01:42:31,995 --> 01:42:35,333
Not at first, Howie, but I
had an ace in the hole:

1245
01:42:35,450 --> 01:42:38,624
a major stockholder in the company
with the clout and support I needed.

1246
01:42:38,703 --> 01:42:40,797
Don, I want you to meet...

1247
01:42:40,872 --> 01:42:43,921
the new chairperson
of the Pemrose Corporation...

1248
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,253
and the daughter of the founder...

1249
01:42:46,254 --> 01:42:48,095
Vera Prescott.

1250
01:42:50,590 --> 01:42:53,434
Afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

1251
01:42:53,509 --> 01:42:55,477
Brantley and I
are very old friends...

1252
01:42:55,553 --> 01:42:58,682
and when he told me his wonderful
ideas for running the company...

1253
01:42:58,764 --> 01:43:00,766
I knew he was
the man for the job.

1254
01:43:00,850 --> 01:43:05,447
I think we all understand
your real motivation here, Vera.

1255
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:09,649
I admit I felt...

1256
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:12,654
some attraction towards
Brantley at the beginning...

1257
01:43:12,737 --> 01:43:15,115
but as you've always
told me, Howard...

1258
01:43:15,198 --> 01:43:16,950
love is love...

1259
01:43:17,033 --> 01:43:19,252
but business is business.

1260
01:43:19,827 --> 01:43:22,580
You've run Daddy's company
into the ground, Howard...

1261
01:43:22,705 --> 01:43:26,005
and I believe these people here can
bring it back to where it belongs again.

1262
01:43:26,918 --> 01:43:29,922
Now, up, Howard,
out of that chair.

1263
01:43:30,671 --> 01:43:34,016
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm not about to resign my position.

1264
01:43:34,017 --> 01:43:37,888
You don't have to, Howard.
You're fired.

1265
01:43:37,970 --> 01:43:39,597
What?

1266
01:43:40,264 --> 01:43:42,642
- Vera, you can't!
- Yes, I can.

1267
01:43:42,808 --> 01:43:44,810
You see, Mr Davenport...

1268
01:43:44,894 --> 01:43:49,397
as of this afternoon,
I control 50.1% of the voting stock.

1269
01:43:49,398 --> 01:43:51,617
You, too, Art.
You're history.

1270
01:43:55,279 --> 01:43:58,909
Brantley, Christy,
Jean, Melrose.

1271
01:44:08,042 --> 01:44:09,840
Gentlemen, just in time.

1272
01:44:09,919 --> 01:44:12,718
Mr Prescott and his aide have
disrupted a very important meeting.

1273
01:44:12,797 --> 01:44:14,891
Would you please escort them
out of the building?

1274
01:44:14,966 --> 01:44:17,845
Vera! Why this open hostility?

1275
01:44:17,927 --> 01:44:20,476
I don't understand.
How did you get so...

1276
01:44:20,596 --> 01:44:22,690
Would you take charge of
the meeting now, Brantley?

1277
01:44:22,765 --> 01:44:25,143
- What did I ever do to deserve this?
- Excuse me.

1278
01:44:35,736 --> 01:44:38,205
Feel free to do that
amongst yourselves if you want.

1279
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:45,504
- So have you been to Kansas?
- No. What's in Kansas?

1280
01:44:45,621 --> 01:44:49,296
Well, I figured we'd take
the private Pemrose jet...

1281
01:44:49,375 --> 01:44:51,503
drop in on the folks.

1282
01:44:51,836 --> 01:44:53,838
They're gonna want to meet you.

1283
01:44:57,383 --> 01:44:59,681
Why haven't I met you before?

1284
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:02,058
Baby, you ain't been hangin'
out in the mailroom.

1285
01:45:02,221 --> 01:45:04,974
The mailroom.
I like that sound.

1286
01:45:12,273 --> 01:45:15,573
Charlie, we got that same problem
with elevator three again.

1287
01:45:15,651 --> 01:45:17,824
I don't believe this.

1288
01:45:18,613 --> 01:45:20,365
This elevator's stuck again.

1289
01:46:23,844 --> 01:46:26,814
- Where to, sir?
- The opera, Rattigan.

1290
01:46:26,889 --> 01:46:29,392
Yes, sir.
