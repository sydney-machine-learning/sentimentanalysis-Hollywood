1
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,487
Do exactly as I say.

2
00:00:56,591 --> 00:01:00,084
Stand up slowly,
walk ahead of me and open the door.

3
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:13,004
Freeze!

4
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:16,132
Everybody freeze! Nobody move!

5
00:01:16,236 --> 00:01:17,761
You, lock the doors.

6
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:21,136
All of you, eat the floor! Now!

7
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,283
Now!

8
00:01:24,988 --> 00:01:26,725
Get your ass down here now.

9
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,361
Lock it. Right now, lock it.

10
00:01:30,536 --> 00:01:31,994
Eat the floor. Move!

11
00:01:39,127 --> 00:01:40,752
Let's go!

12
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,454
Come on, move it. Go.

13
00:01:46,558 --> 00:01:48,675
Two minutes.

14
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:53,267
1:45.

15
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,192
Stay down.

16
00:02:04,736 --> 00:02:06,314
One minute.

17
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:12,110
30 seconds.

18
00:02:15,664 --> 00:02:16,707
Now!

19
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:26,300
Time!

20
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:29,007
- Move out.
- Move it.

21
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:06,868
<i>~ No matter what</i>
<i>you think you pulled ~</i>

22
00:03:06,973 --> 00:03:08,958
<i>~ You'll find it's not enough ~</i>

23
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,330

24
00:03:12,434 --> 00:03:14,338

00:03:27,653 --> 00:03:30,267

00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:33,227
<i>~ Everybody wants into the crime life ~</i>

29
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:37,275
<i>~ Breakdown, takedown, you're busted ~</i>

30
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:41,822
<i>~ Shakedown, breakdown, honey ~</i>

31
00:03:41,926 --> 00:03:44,658
<i>~ Just about the time</i>
<i>you're thinking it's all right ~</i>

32
00:03:44,762 --> 00:03:49,545
<i>~ Breakdown, shakedown, you're busted ~</i>

33
00:03:57,766 --> 00:03:59,426

00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:26,704

37
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,747

00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:38,305

48
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:14,454
- Hey, Ace, over here.
- Hey, Vinnie.

49
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:16,871
I'd very much like you to meet Judy.

50
00:05:16,976 --> 00:05:20,250
She can suck a golf ball
through 20 feet of garden hose.

51
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:22,380
Impressive. Can you excuse us?

52
00:05:22,484 --> 00:05:26,421
Go over there!
Go over there!

53
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,596
Thank you, Judy.
Where'd you find that bitch?

54
00:05:29,701 --> 00:05:32,055
- She's my girl.
- The bitch ain't happy.

55
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,638
I need help.
I need more credit cards.

56
00:05:34,742 --> 00:05:36,142
How many?

57
00:05:36,246 --> 00:05:39,231
American Express blank credit cards.
I need 2,000.

58
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:42,567
- Get the fuck out of here!
- If you can't handle it,

59
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:45,360
I'll take my money
to somebody who can.

60
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:48,198
OK, whoa, whoa.
You got the money?

61
00:05:48,303 --> 00:05:50,363
I said I got a bag of money.

62
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:53,870
This big, this wide,
full to the brim with money.

63
00:05:53,974 --> 00:05:56,625
- When do you need the cards?
- In three hours.

64
00:05:56,729 --> 00:05:58,500
Get out. Give me time.

65
00:05:58,605 --> 00:06:01,165
I'm a businessman.
I got to make moves.

66
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,457
Three hours!

67
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:05,299
If you can't help me,
I'll go somewhere else.

68
00:06:05,403 --> 00:06:07,297
I got to move all the time.

69
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,842
- You got the money?
- I got the money. You got the cards?

70
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:15,847
Listen, you meet me at this address.
Three hours.

71
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:20,314
Don't have me standing around while
you're messing with the titty woman.

72
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:22,062
- Three hours.
- Three hours.

73
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:25,069
- Three hours...
- Three hours...

74
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:27,484
<i>~ Shakedown, breakdown, takedown ~</i>

75
00:06:27,588 --> 00:06:30,780
<i>~ Just about the time you're</i>
<i>thinking it's all right ~</i>

76
00:06:30,884 --> 00:06:34,543
<i>~ Breakdown, takedown, shakedown,</i>
<i>you're busted ~</i>

77
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:38,077
<i>~ Shakedown, breakdown... ~</i>

78
00:06:38,182 --> 00:06:42,211
Hey, Foley, only real cops
can come in here.

79
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:47,098
- I thought you were dead, Granby.
- I hate to bother you. One question.

80
00:06:47,227 --> 00:06:49,547
- I got to go.
- I'll ask you later.

81
00:06:49,652 --> 00:06:51,639
You act like you never saw a suit!

82
00:07:32,564 --> 00:07:34,687
Detective Axel Foley, please.

83
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,861
Hello!

84
00:07:38,904 --> 00:07:41,767
You has reached the home
of George Kingfish Stephens.

85
00:07:41,871 --> 00:07:44,773
Sorry I'm not in
but I done gone to the Lodge Hall.

86
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:48,859
Leave a message and I'll get back
at my earliest inconvenience.

87
00:07:48,963 --> 00:07:51,864
- Axel, it's Bogomil.
- Hey! How you doing?

88
00:07:51,968 --> 00:07:54,656
I have to cancel out
on the fishing trip.

89
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,322
Man! I was going to teach you
how to fish.

90
00:07:57,427 --> 00:08:01,829
It's OK cos I'm up to my ass on this
credit card fake - and I'm close.

91
00:08:01,933 --> 00:08:03,709
How's your daughter, Jan?

92
00:08:03,813 --> 00:08:07,583
'If she didn't have a father with
a gun, something would've happened!'

93
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,214
She's great, isn't she?

94
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,339
Look, I'm into something
kind of important here.

95
00:08:12,444 --> 00:08:15,429
I'll fill you in
when I get it straight myself.

96
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:20,141
I'm late, Axel. Look,
you take care of yourself, you hear?

97
00:08:20,245 --> 00:08:24,809
Listen, punch Rosewood in his eye
and slap Taggart's bald head for me.

98
00:08:24,913 --> 00:08:27,862
Bye, Axel. I'll call you in a week.

99
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,698
Marcy doesn't want to meet you.

100
00:08:35,802 --> 00:08:38,408
Inspector Todd wants
to see you immediately.

101
00:08:38,512 --> 00:08:41,330
What do you mean she
doesn't want to see me?

102
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:44,416
- She doesn't like you.
- She doesn't know me.

103
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:47,419
- I described you to her.
- Why?! I help you.

104
00:08:47,524 --> 00:08:50,294
I tell Todd
you're working 24 hours a day.

105
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:52,423
Jesus, look at that watch.

106
00:08:52,528 --> 00:08:54,922
Jeffrey, please, leave me alone!

107
00:08:55,026 --> 00:08:57,763
I got to work undercover with you.
Why not?

108
00:08:57,867 --> 00:09:00,011
If Marcy won't give me her number,

109
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:02,596
I'll give you mine
and you pass it on.

110
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,811
I'm very close to shooting you.

111
00:09:04,915 --> 00:09:08,269
As far as undercover goes,
I want to be involved.

112
00:09:08,374 --> 00:09:10,816
- You want to work undercover?
- Yes!

113
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,487
When Todd asks where I am, tell
him I'm pursuing my credit card bust.

114
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:15,634
Now you're undercover.

115
00:09:24,676 --> 00:09:27,418
LA Times got a letter like that
two hours ago.

116
00:09:27,522 --> 00:09:29,339
He knows that, Billy.

117
00:09:30,766 --> 00:09:32,714
Is this guy serious?

118
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:35,756
He's serious about
the way he pulled the job.

119
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,550
He knew exactly how long
to stay inside and what to take.

120
00:09:39,654 --> 00:09:41,636
Captain, I have this friend...

121
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,099
Why are you involved with this case?

122
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:48,058
I assigned you and Taggart
to the Peterson extortion case.

123
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:51,195
Bogomil, get your men in here.
Come on.

124
00:09:53,664 --> 00:09:56,111
You can't keep God waiting.

125
00:09:56,215 --> 00:09:58,610
I don't want to hear
that kind of talk.

126
00:09:58,715 --> 00:10:01,657
He's fired every cop who
worked for the old chief.

127
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:03,576
There's only us three left.

128
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,916
He's still head of this department.

129
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:10,263
Yes, sir.

130
00:10:12,891 --> 00:10:14,712
Very smart, Billy.

131
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:16,924
I have a relationship with this dude.

132
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:21,138
Dude? Dude? We're not even
supposed to be working on this case.

133
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:24,390
Come on, Sarge.
I know you have domestic troubles,

134
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:26,806
but you got to cool out, relax.

135
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,274
Things like this work out. Trust me.

136
00:10:34,037 --> 00:10:38,821
You moron. You called the
Supervising Agent of the goddamn FBI

137
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:41,159
to help break this Alphabet code?

138
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:47,371
This is a local crime. My men
will solve it locally, Roseweed.

139
00:10:47,475 --> 00:10:50,919
- Sir, my name's not Roseweed...
- Shut up, please.

140
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,960
And you, Captain Bogomil,

141
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:58,005
this Alphabet investigation
was your baby.

142
00:10:58,109 --> 00:11:02,471
Did you call the FBI? Did you order
Rosewood to do that? Did you?

143
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:05,474
Captain Bogomil didn't know about it.

144
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:06,845
I said shut up!

145
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:09,770
Captain Bogomil didn't
call the FBI. I did.

146
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:12,524
I said shut up.

147
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:15,442
I'm waiting on you, Andrew.

148
00:11:15,547 --> 00:11:19,905
Did you order him to call
the goddamn FBI or what?

149
00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:22,402
No, sir, but that's beside the point.

150
00:11:22,507 --> 00:11:27,164
No, that is exactly the point.
Thank you. You're history, kiddo.

151
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,081
You know very well
that half of police work

152
00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:33,376
are cops following their hunches.

153
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,503
They go with their gut reaction.

154
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:39,839
I've encouraged this in my men
and I'm standing behind Rosewood.

155
00:11:39,943 --> 00:11:42,051
Good! Tell me something, Andrew,

156
00:11:42,156 --> 00:11:45,593
how do you consider yourself
a commanding officer?

157
00:11:45,698 --> 00:11:50,015
You can't maintain a supervisory
relationship with your own personnel.

158
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,060
And now you've superseded
the chain of command.

159
00:11:53,164 --> 00:11:55,023
As of now, you are suspended.

160
00:11:55,127 --> 00:11:57,066
- What?
- Shut up!

161
00:11:57,171 --> 00:11:58,983
On what grounds?

162
00:11:59,087 --> 00:12:02,610
You have no control
over your troop's activities.

163
00:12:02,715 --> 00:12:04,696
God damn it, you can't do this!

164
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,367
I can't do it? I will not have
this investigation pissed away.

165
00:12:09,471 --> 00:12:14,000
This crime, this robbery, could be
a political disaster for the mayor.

166
00:12:14,104 --> 00:12:15,794
What about due process?

167
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:20,007
Policy requires we give you
a board of review within two days.

168
00:12:20,111 --> 00:12:21,717
You got two days.

169
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:24,675
I am fighting you on this, Harold.

170
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,433
Chief Lutz to you.

171
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:33,392
Where are you going?
I'm not through with you two guys.

172
00:12:33,496 --> 00:12:37,813
Would you two like to hold onto
your jobs a little while longer?

173
00:12:37,918 --> 00:12:41,411
You report to traffic duty,
effective immediately.

174
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,119
Yes, sir.

175
00:13:39,556 --> 00:13:41,255
- Hi.
- Hi. Trouble?

176
00:13:41,359 --> 00:13:42,402
Yeah.

177
00:13:42,643 --> 00:13:44,674
Maybe I can help.

178
00:13:44,778 --> 00:13:46,590
Yeah, it just stopped.

179
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,930
- Is it getting gas?
- I don't know.

180
00:13:56,073 --> 00:13:58,149
What do you make of this, Andrew?

181
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:02,070
Who the hell are you?

182
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:44,071
Hey, Vinnie!

183
00:14:46,206 --> 00:14:47,249

'I just found out.
I'm sorry. What happened?'

202

00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:21,536
This Alphabet Bandit.

It's all politics here now, Axel.

212
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:31,925
I don't think they'll let
me and Taggart on it.

- Hey, Ace!

Axel? Axel?

Ace, I'm sorry I'm late,
but I run into this broad.

00:16:48,087 --> 00:16:51,569
You're the fucking guy
with the truckload of cigarettes!

218
00:16:51,673 --> 00:16:54,029
He told the cops he was from Buffalo.

219
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:57,450
Hey, man, take off your glasses.

220
00:16:57,554 --> 00:16:59,744
I thought that was you, man.

221
00:16:59,848 --> 00:17:02,870
I did get busted
and I lost my whole investment!

222
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:06,331
What's wrong with you?
You know I'm a businessman.

223
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:09,921
You come a half-hour late
and you bring a cop!

224
00:17:10,025 --> 00:17:12,253
What cop? He ain't no cop.

225
00:17:12,358 --> 00:17:15,344
It's Dirty Harry himself.
What's wrong with you?

226
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:17,137
- Cop?
- Definitely!

227
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:18,387
He's my nephew.

228
00:17:18,491 --> 00:17:21,558
Well, the dude is definitely
bad luck to me!

229
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:27,064
I'll tell you what's bad luck.
My friend's in a prison body shop.

230
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:29,523
- He's a fucking clown.
- What?

231
00:17:29,627 --> 00:17:32,317
I'm checking you for a wire, man.

232
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:36,071
If he ain't a cop,
why can't I frisk him?

233
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:37,533
Stop this bullshit.

234
00:17:37,637 --> 00:17:40,197
Why won't he let me frisk him then?
Why?

235
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:41,700
Cut the bullshit.

236
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:45,289
I got 2,000 blank
American Express cards. Right now.

237
00:17:45,394 --> 00:17:47,001
You wanna do business?

238
00:17:47,105 --> 00:17:51,041
With you, but not in front of him
because this dude's a cop.

239
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:53,172
I can smell a pig.

240
00:17:53,277 --> 00:17:57,508
I used to be a Muslim. I know pork.
Yes, pork! Definitely pork.

241
00:17:57,612 --> 00:18:00,347
I ain't doing shit
around this dude, man.

242
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:02,512
Fuck you, man. Allahu Akhbar.

243
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:04,432
You calling me a cop?

244
00:18:04,536 --> 00:18:06,569
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

245
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:17,501
Jeff. Hey.

246
00:18:18,126 --> 00:18:21,035
Where have you been?
Todd's looking for you.

247
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:23,116
I hope you made the bust.

248
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,746
- Can I count on you, trust you?
- Yes.

249
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,000
We working undercover together?
And you'll be quiet?

250
00:18:29,104 --> 00:18:32,346
- Who are you talking to?
- OK, listen. Shh, wait.

251
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:38,382
- Drive the Ferrari for a few days.
- The Ferrari?

252
00:18:38,486 --> 00:18:41,054
I'm leaving town
for a few days and...

253
00:18:42,693 --> 00:18:45,684
- I need you to drive the Ferrari.
- Where?

254
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:47,600
Around. But you have to be me.

255
00:18:47,704 --> 00:18:51,144
- How do I do that?
- Duck down. Drive like this.

256
00:18:51,248 --> 00:18:54,522
- Drive it...
- No one can know it's you.

257
00:18:54,627 --> 00:18:57,319
Don't have people
hanging around the car.

258
00:18:57,423 --> 00:19:00,573
It draws attention to yourself.
Have one person... Marcy!

259
00:19:00,677 --> 00:19:02,239
Drive Marcy in it.

260
00:19:02,344 --> 00:19:04,701
- We're supposed to meet...
- What?

261
00:19:04,805 --> 00:19:07,245
For the car.
She wants to be in the car.

262
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,912
- She likes the car?
- She loves it.

263
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:15,128
Drive with Marcy, scootch down.
Don't tell anybody about this. OK?

264
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:19,759
And I know you don't understand,
but this'll make me cop of the month.

265
00:19:19,863 --> 00:19:22,008
We'll be there smiling together.

266
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:23,806
- I can trust you?
- Yes.

267
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,515
You're my friend?
You understand this?

268
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:28,735
- No.
- Good.

269
00:19:35,787 --> 00:19:37,819
Inspector T, how you doing?

270
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:40,203
Where the fuck you been, Foley?

271
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:45,324
- And what the fuck is this?
- It's a blue slip.

272
00:19:45,428 --> 00:19:47,953
Why the hell you need $1,000?

273
00:19:48,057 --> 00:19:51,750
- A little flash money...
- Flash money? Let's see...

274
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:55,257
$2,000 for a suit.

275
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:57,968
$200 for a tie.

276
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:01,216
A requisition order for a Ferrari.

277
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,175
I've seen enough blue slips.
How about some arrest slips?

278
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:10,347
I know you're getting upset. You have
reason to be, but I am close.

279
00:20:10,451 --> 00:20:14,687
I am so close now
and it's making me crazy.

280
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:17,648
I could smell it. It's in the air.

281
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:20,026
Do you smell it? Cos I smell it.

282
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:21,944
All I smell is your bullshit.

283
00:20:22,048 --> 00:20:24,611
I'm pouring money
down a bottomless hole.

284
00:20:24,716 --> 00:20:27,159
Where are the bad guys
at the end of this?

285
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,080
Wait. I thought
if there was a problem...

286
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:32,789
Don't think, Axel!
It makes my dick itch.

287
00:20:32,894 --> 00:20:36,416
Truth is, this department's
furnished you a fortune.

288
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,014
My ass is on the line.
I OK'd all this shit.

289
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,093
I must have been
out of my fucking mind.

290
00:20:46,197 --> 00:20:49,721
But I can't pull out
without a bust or I'm finished.

291
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:55,187
I promise you, I won't go down alone.
I'm gonna give you three days.

292
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:58,775
If I don't see some results,
I'll cover my own ass.

293
00:20:58,879 --> 00:21:01,234
How do you like that arrangement?

294
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:05,449
If I only have three days,
I have to go deep undercover.

295
00:21:05,553 --> 00:21:07,281
I'm deep now. This is deep.

296
00:21:07,385 --> 00:21:09,910
But I'm going deeper.
No more money.

297
00:21:10,014 --> 00:21:12,537
I'm going deep,
deep, deep undercover.

298
00:21:12,642 --> 00:21:16,375
Sign that, and I'm going so deep,
you will not even know...

299
00:21:16,479 --> 00:21:17,748
People will page me.

300
00:21:17,852 --> 00:21:21,588
Axel? No answer
cos I'll be deep undercover.

301
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:25,547
I'm tired of your bullshit, Foley.
You got three days.

302
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:29,970
If I don't see results,
I'll grind your ass into dog meat.

303
00:21:30,075 --> 00:21:32,727
Deal. I'll have a dog-meat ass.

304
00:21:32,832 --> 00:21:35,102
Now please sign for my flash money.

305
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:38,894
Flash money! Make sure
nothing happens to that Ferrari.

306
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,980
That's a $50,000 automobile.

307
00:21:41,085 --> 00:21:46,869
No, no, no. It's $67,000. And fast.
It goes from 100 to 150 in like...

308
00:21:48,003 --> 00:21:51,087
You just better make sure
nothing happens to it.

309
00:21:52,508 --> 00:21:55,416
Don't worry about a thing.
The car's safe.

310
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,208
No one else will be driving but me.

311
00:21:58,312 --> 00:22:02,877
I will sleep, eat, drink, shit...
No, I ain't going to shit.

312
00:22:02,982 --> 00:22:06,051
You thought I was going to...
I ain't gonna shit.

313
00:22:06,156 --> 00:22:09,009
Don't worry about it.
I'm on the job. I'm on the job.

314
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:10,198
That's what I'm afraid of!

315
00:22:26,375 --> 00:22:28,043
He's OK.

316
00:22:29,294 --> 00:22:32,618
- What are you doing here?
- How's he doing?

317
00:22:32,723 --> 00:22:36,871
If he's strong enough to live
through that, he's got a chance.

318
00:22:36,975 --> 00:22:40,376
- I got to see those letters.
- They're at the station.

319
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,459
Yeah, but we can't take you there.

320
00:22:42,563 --> 00:22:45,172
We're not supposed
to be on that case.

321
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:48,177
It's a new ball game
and we're not invited.

322
00:22:48,281 --> 00:22:51,512
Neither am I,
but I got to see those letters.

323
00:22:51,617 --> 00:22:53,980
It won't hurt
to let him see them.

324
00:22:55,237 --> 00:22:57,268
OK, but we got to be careful.

325
00:22:57,372 --> 00:23:01,059
Lutz is just looking for a reason
to bust our asses.

326
00:23:01,164 --> 00:23:03,774
Meet me back at the station
in an hour.

327
00:23:03,878 --> 00:23:08,238
I'm going to say hi to Jan
and... take a peek.

328
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:10,041
- All right?
- OK.

329
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:15,215
Hey.

330
00:23:17,551 --> 00:23:20,552
- How you doing?
- Oh, Axel.

331
00:23:22,347 --> 00:23:24,334
Oh, come on, stop that.

332
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:28,300
I get shot like this all the time
in Detroit. He'll be fine.

333
00:23:37,154 --> 00:23:40,683
He was talking about going fishing
until yesterday.

334
00:23:40,788 --> 00:23:45,022
Then... he seemed preoccupied.

335
00:23:45,126 --> 00:23:49,699
I'm gonna come by the house after
I get settled and look around, OK?

336
00:23:50,918 --> 00:23:52,542
Thanks, Axel.

356
00:25:16,128 --> 00:25:18,408
Where are the owners of this house?

357
00:25:18,512 --> 00:25:22,035
They haven't taken possession yet.
They're in Hawaii for a week.

358
00:25:22,139 --> 00:25:25,467
Is there a foreman around? Thank you.

359
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:39,222
Everybody, stop what
you're doing, please. Stop it!

360
00:25:39,326 --> 00:25:41,265
Stop what you're doing!

361
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,353
Beverly Hills building inspector.

362
00:25:44,457 --> 00:25:48,981
Everybody, stop what you're doing.
I'd like to speak with your foreman.

363
00:25:49,086 --> 00:25:53,362
You. Put the bucket down!
Somebody get me the foreman.

364
00:25:53,466 --> 00:25:57,114
- I'm the foreman here.
- You? Where are the plans?

365
00:25:57,218 --> 00:26:01,450
Cos you're making a very big fucking
mistake. Get the plans, please.

366
00:26:01,554 --> 00:26:04,956
- Who are you?
- I'm the building investigator.

367
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,250
- Nobody told you I was coming?
- No.

368
00:26:07,354 --> 00:26:10,170
Get me the goddamn plans.
Can you guys stop working?

369
00:26:10,275 --> 00:26:13,756
Stop it! Stop working!
Get me the plans.

370
00:26:13,861 --> 00:26:18,008
- Whoa, wait a second. This is wrong.
- What do you mean?

371
00:26:18,113 --> 00:26:22,141
These are the old plans!
Weren't you at the meeting?

372
00:26:22,245 --> 00:26:24,267
- No.
- Before they went to Hawaii?

373
00:26:24,371 --> 00:26:25,850
- No.
- Not at the meeting?

374
00:26:25,954 --> 00:26:30,065
I was there to change these plans.
The Andersons changed the plans.

375
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,398
Oh, man!

376
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:34,442
There's not supposed
to be any right angles.

377
00:26:34,546 --> 00:26:37,615
- You! You! Stop working!
- Stop working!

378
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:39,657
You're destroying the house.

379
00:26:39,761 --> 00:26:42,950
Wait! No right angles?
It's like a doughnut.

380
00:26:43,054 --> 00:26:47,082
What are you, a fucking art critic?
Let them live inside a doughnut.

381
00:26:47,187 --> 00:26:51,462
Some people want to live in a round
house. You got the money? Fuck it.

382
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:54,754
Guys, stop it.
I'll have to straighten this out.

383
00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:56,716
I'll talk to my people,

384
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,969
they'll talk to your people
and nobody gets fired.

385
00:27:00,073 --> 00:27:01,635
I did what they said.

386
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,930
You were right,
but whoever told you's an asshole.

387
00:27:05,035 --> 00:27:08,807
Everybody come down, go home.
Relax. You got the week off.

388
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:10,894
We'll straighten this thing out.

389
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:13,440
Give your boys
a big round of applause.

390
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:15,152
You've done a good job.

391
00:27:15,256 --> 00:27:18,987
Other than the house being square,
it's beautiful.

392
00:27:19,091 --> 00:27:21,698
Go home and relax
for the rest of the week.

393
00:27:21,802 --> 00:27:24,620
I'll straighten this out.
It's Miller time.

394
00:27:24,724 --> 00:27:26,043
All right. Thank you.

395
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:31,917
So you'll straighten
all this out, huh?

396
00:27:32,021 --> 00:27:35,180
Will you stop worrying and go home?
Trust me.

397
00:27:37,186 --> 00:27:40,768
Could somebody clean this shit up
before you leave?

398
00:27:46,445 --> 00:27:49,142
Lutz's guys are working
on the codes.

399
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:52,602
Lutz thinks he's a serial robber.
I think he's a nutcase.

400
00:27:52,706 --> 00:27:54,105
Lutz IS a nut case.

401
00:27:54,209 --> 00:27:57,194
Not Lutz. The Alphabet Bandit.

402
00:27:57,298 --> 00:28:00,319
I don't think so.
He's too smart. What else you got?

403
00:28:00,423 --> 00:28:04,960
These shell casings are from
the first robbery at Adriano's.

404
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:11,539
These are.44 auto mags. They don't
make these any more - too expensive.

405
00:28:11,643 --> 00:28:16,376
This is a casing from a.308 rifle.
They cut it down to fit a.44.

406
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,378
They knew what they were doing.

407
00:28:18,482 --> 00:28:21,634
- Oh, shit. Put this stuff away.
- Who's this?

408
00:28:21,738 --> 00:28:23,967
- Lutz.
- All right. Show time!

409
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:26,052
What's going on? Who are you?

410
00:28:26,156 --> 00:28:29,105
- Uh, chief, this is...
- Shut up, Rosewood.

411
00:28:30,405 --> 00:28:33,269
Uh, my name is
Johnny Wish... Wishbone.

412
00:28:33,373 --> 00:28:36,275
I'm a psychic from
the island of St Croix.

413
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:39,278
Yes, I'm a psychic and
I read in the St Croix Gazette

414
00:28:39,382 --> 00:28:43,151
that the Beverly Hills Police
had some trouble solving crime.

415
00:28:43,256 --> 00:28:45,321
So I came to Beverly Hills to help.

416
00:28:45,426 --> 00:28:49,411
They tell me they don't want my help.
I'm a psychic!

417
00:28:49,515 --> 00:28:52,915
I'm a psychic phenomenon.
Watch. I don't know you.

418
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,003
Your name is, um... Lutz! Right?

419
00:28:56,107 --> 00:29:00,043
Chief Lutz, that's your name.
The name pop inside my head.

420
00:29:00,148 --> 00:29:03,551
- And your name is, um...
- Biddle.

421
00:29:03,655 --> 00:29:06,261
Two more seconds
and I'd say it myself.

422
00:29:06,365 --> 00:29:10,559
I don't need no help. I'm Johnny
Wishbone, psychic extraordinaire.

423
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:14,311
If you need me, just think
Johnny Wishbone and I come.

424
00:29:14,415 --> 00:29:17,232
Lutz and Biddle,
it's like Kibbles and Bits!

425
00:29:17,337 --> 00:29:22,150
Excuse me. Sorry to bother you.
Your name is Johnson, right?

426
00:29:22,254 --> 00:29:25,112
What the hell is going on?
Is this a magic show?

427
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:28,626
I'll have your badges unless
you go to traffic duty. Get out!

428
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:34,333
I got angina the minute I saw Foley.
Axel's got nine lives. I don't.

429
00:29:34,437 --> 00:29:36,136
You boys ready? Let's go.

430
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,631
You both know Lutz
is a shit tinhorn politician.

431
00:29:41,735 --> 00:29:46,260
His boy Biddle couldn't catch the
Alphabet killer if he nuked the city.

432
00:29:46,365 --> 00:29:49,264
We got to do this.
All for one, one for all.

433
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:52,972
Lutz is about to fire our asses.
I'll lose my pension.

434
00:29:53,077 --> 00:29:55,186
I got a wife and two kids to feed.

435
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,435
You got two kids, not a wife.

436
00:29:57,539 --> 00:29:59,355
Shut up. She might come back.

437
00:29:59,459 --> 00:30:02,444
Maureen's divorcing him again.
She's with her mother.

438
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:05,281
Two years ago, I almost lost my job.

439
00:30:05,385 --> 00:30:08,450
The man put his neck
on the line for me.

440
00:30:08,555 --> 00:30:11,908
I'm not going back to
Detroit without helping him.

441
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:15,370
And his boys don't even
have any loyalty for him!

442
00:30:15,474 --> 00:30:18,377
OK, don't give me
this crap about loyalty.

443
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:20,678
Andy and I joined the force together.

444
00:30:24,853 --> 00:30:26,182
OK, OK.

445
00:30:27,606 --> 00:30:31,354
If we do this, it's got to be
low-profile. Covert.

446
00:30:32,528 --> 00:30:35,807
Billy and I have traffic duty,
for Christ's sake.

447
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:37,780
Give me a break.

448
00:30:40,702 --> 00:30:43,982
- Where'd you get that?
- You stole evidence!

449
00:30:44,086 --> 00:30:46,234
- I only took one.
- Why?

450
00:30:46,338 --> 00:30:48,236
This is known as a clue.

451
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,198
Few people know how
to do this quality work.

452
00:30:51,303 --> 00:30:54,704
- We'll see who recognises it.
- Who are these guys?

453
00:30:54,808 --> 00:30:57,414
This is your town.
You should know that.

454
00:30:57,518 --> 00:31:00,624
There's a guy
at the Beverly Hills Shooting Club.

455
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:03,292
Russ Fielding.
Supposed to be the best.

456
00:31:03,396 --> 00:31:05,764
Let's go see Russ Fielding, then.

457
00:31:19,116 --> 00:31:21,352
- What's in the bag?
- My vitamins.

458
00:31:21,457 --> 00:31:25,366
- Give them to me.
- You want my vitamins? All of them?

459
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:29,168
An hour.

460
00:31:29,293 --> 00:31:31,119
Enjoy good health.

461
00:31:41,305 --> 00:31:44,213
- Excuse me.
- One second. What year is this?

462
00:31:44,317 --> 00:31:45,360
'73.

463
00:31:46,768 --> 00:31:48,844
- Yes. It is '73.
- I know.

464
00:32:01,283 --> 00:32:05,190
Ahem. Uh, may I help you?

465
00:32:05,294 --> 00:32:08,528
I'm from
Medalux Explosive Research Company.

466
00:32:08,632 --> 00:32:11,071
Does Russell Fielding work here?

467
00:32:11,175 --> 00:32:12,218
Yes.

468
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,781
He ordered these plutonium-nitrate,

469
00:32:14,885 --> 00:32:17,955
multi-explosive,
sound-seeking projectiles.

470
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:20,036
Here they go. Have a nice day.

471
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,876
Wait a minute.
What did you say? Medalux?

472
00:32:22,981 --> 00:32:25,374
Medalux Explosive Research Company.

473
00:32:25,478 --> 00:32:28,171
I don't show any record
of that delivery.

474
00:32:28,276 --> 00:32:32,008
I think there must be a mistake.
Your company made a mistake.

475
00:32:32,113 --> 00:32:35,929
- Y'all made a mistake.
- Ha! No. You don't understand.

476
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:40,643
I know about every delivery here.
They put it in this little log.

477
00:32:40,747 --> 00:32:43,519
We'll straighten this out
with research.

478
00:32:43,623 --> 00:32:49,066
This is a sound-seeking projectile.
I suggest no telephones. Don't cough.

479
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,733
If you break wind,
make it a quiet one.

480
00:32:51,838 --> 00:32:55,612
The slightest peep and your
designer jeans won't fit no more.

481
00:32:55,717 --> 00:32:57,752
Y'all handle this after I go.

482
00:32:59,842 --> 00:33:04,831
Ahem. Excuse me. I just realised,
you could do me a big favour

483
00:33:04,935 --> 00:33:07,793
and drop this off
at Mr Fielding's office.

484
00:33:07,897 --> 00:33:09,590
Let me explain something.

485
00:33:09,694 --> 00:33:12,509
My friend Bootsie
got killed doing this.

486
00:33:12,614 --> 00:33:16,927
I ain't carrying this cos y'all made
a mistake. I carry from A to B.

487
00:33:17,032 --> 00:33:21,226
I have a wife and two kids. I'd
like to see my twin daughters again.

488
00:33:21,331 --> 00:33:24,185
It's right on your way out.
It's no problem.

489
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:27,191
If you just drop it off
at Mr Fielding's.

490
00:33:27,295 --> 00:33:31,148
What about my daughters, Monique and
Eunique? What's in it for my family?

491
00:33:31,252 --> 00:33:34,073
What do you want?

492
00:33:34,177 --> 00:33:37,659
What's in it for me?
I have beautiful daughters.

493
00:33:37,763 --> 00:33:41,254
You're asking me to risk my life.
What will I get?

494
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:50,391
$10? I have twin daughters...
with pigtails.

495
00:33:51,602 --> 00:33:55,509
Would you take that off my desk
and drop it off at Mr Fielding's?

496
00:33:55,613 --> 00:34:00,012
That's all I have.
Please take it. I'm sorry, that's it.

497
00:34:00,116 --> 00:34:03,805
- Where's his office?
- Along the corridor, down the steps.

498
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,603
On your way out.
The name's on the office.

499
00:34:06,707 --> 00:34:08,270
Just over there.

500
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:10,438
I'm just doing this for my kids.

501
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:12,568
This is how Bootsie got killed.

502
00:34:12,673 --> 00:34:16,072
All they found was $20 and
a pair of Adidas. Down the hall?

503
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:19,252
Along the corridor. Down the stairs.

504
00:34:25,552 --> 00:34:27,206
We almost got fucked up.

505
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,846
Thank you.

506
00:34:31,141 --> 00:34:34,004
- Shoe money for my daughters.
- Thank you.

507
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:36,510
$5 a shoe. That's four shoes.

508
00:34:39,691 --> 00:34:43,554
She knew you were hard to live with
when she married you.

509
00:34:43,658 --> 00:34:46,600
It's her fault
for thinking you'd change.

510
00:34:46,705 --> 00:34:48,109
Thanks.

511
00:34:49,451 --> 00:34:51,354
I really have to admire her

512
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:55,403
for having the courage to leave you
in search for a better life.

513
00:34:57,334 --> 00:35:00,658
I'm sorry. I was trying
to make you feel better.

514
00:35:00,762 --> 00:35:03,323
- Do me a favour?
- Sure.

515
00:35:03,428 --> 00:35:05,499
Take a break from cheering me up.

516
00:35:16,478 --> 00:35:20,262
Keep the grip tight. There you go.

517
00:35:22,985 --> 00:35:24,811
Fire when you're ready.

518
00:35:32,244 --> 00:35:34,652
Grip down here. There you go.

519
00:35:35,747 --> 00:35:36,946
All right.

520
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:41,293
Keep it up and to the left.
All right?

521
00:35:42,796 --> 00:35:44,617
Excuse me.

522
00:35:44,721 --> 00:35:47,623
- Are you Russ Fielding the gunsmith?
- Yeah.

523
00:35:47,727 --> 00:35:50,120
Have you ever seen this before?

524
00:35:50,224 --> 00:35:53,750
It's a.308 rifle shell
cut to fit the.44.

525
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:56,304
- Where'd you get it?
- Christmas gift.

526
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:00,549
Charles Bronson
is a friend of the family.

527
00:36:00,654 --> 00:36:05,931
- He gave me this for Christmas.
- I'm Karla Fry, assistant manager.

528
00:36:06,035 --> 00:36:09,268
How are you?
Beautiful place you have here.

529
00:36:09,373 --> 00:36:12,449
My name's Richard James.
Very nice to meet you.

530
00:36:13,702 --> 00:36:15,900
Russ, could I see you for a minute?

531
00:36:16,004 --> 00:36:19,080
- Be right back.
- Take your time, Russ.

532
00:36:20,792 --> 00:36:22,702
God damn, that's a big bitch.

533
00:36:52,616 --> 00:36:54,814
- Who is that man?
- I don't know.

534
00:36:54,918 --> 00:36:57,773
He's got a.44 auto mag casing
from here.

535
00:36:57,877 --> 00:36:59,858
I saw. You sure it's ours?

536
00:36:59,962 --> 00:37:05,323
- I made a whole bunch for Mr Cain.
- You didn't tell him that, did you?

537
00:37:05,428 --> 00:37:07,285
- No.
- Don't.

538
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:10,050
Keep him there while I check him out.

539
00:37:16,348 --> 00:37:18,085
I think we have a problem.

540
00:37:18,189 --> 00:37:20,390
Fielding made that casing for Cain.

541
00:37:25,607 --> 00:37:27,434
You wanted to see me?

542
00:37:32,906 --> 00:37:35,520
I'd like to go over plans C and D.

543
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:40,650
We've promised to deliver Thomopolis
$10 million, Friday at 6pm.

544
00:37:40,755 --> 00:37:42,485
If we fail,

545
00:37:42,589 --> 00:37:46,784
I stand to be put to considerable
inconvenience to say the least.

546
00:37:46,888 --> 00:37:48,826
So I'd like to go over it

547
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:52,701
and avoid the same mistakes
that were made on the Adriano job.

548
00:37:52,805 --> 00:37:56,004
What mistakes? Adriano's was perfect.

549
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,434
Adriano's was not perfect.

550
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:10,469
It was perfectly planned,

551
00:38:10,573 --> 00:38:13,439
but it was executed
with incompetence.

552
00:38:17,242 --> 00:38:19,063
It was partly my fault.

553
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:22,069
I assumed that
if my instructions were clear,

554
00:38:22,173 --> 00:38:24,234
even you could follow them.

555
00:38:24,338 --> 00:38:27,287
- Obviously, I was wrong.
- I don't understand.

556
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:35,206
You supplied your thugs
with guns from my club?

557
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:38,997
Yes. But they were totally clean.
Nobody could trace them.

558
00:38:39,102 --> 00:38:43,631
Nobody knows you planned the jobs.
Nobody knows you wrote the notes,

559
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:46,802
Karla did the job and left the notes.

560
00:38:46,906 --> 00:38:49,805
Then why is there a man in my club

561
00:38:49,909 --> 00:38:53,973
with shell casings
from one of my guns asking questions?

562
00:38:54,077 --> 00:38:55,269
I don't know.

563
00:38:57,783 --> 00:38:59,158
Who is he?

564
00:39:00,702 --> 00:39:03,361
I'd say he's a cop. Wouldn't you?

565
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,662
I don't know. I haven't seen him.

566
00:39:08,085 --> 00:39:11,454
Well, here he is - on television.

567
00:39:13,257 --> 00:39:17,080
Take a good look at him
because you're going to kill him.

568
00:39:17,184 --> 00:39:18,227
What?

569
00:39:19,263 --> 00:39:21,551
Kill him, burn him, blow him away.

570
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:35,932
How long would it take
to shave those legs?

571
00:39:36,037 --> 00:39:39,315
I suppose you're trying
to be charming.

572
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:43,814
I'm just offering
my grooming services.

573
00:39:43,919 --> 00:39:45,656
I don't think so.

574
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,447
Chip, perfect timing for once.

575
00:39:50,551 --> 00:39:52,824
Chip Cain. I'm the manager here.

576
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:57,078
How are you, Chip? Beautiful place
here, very comfortable.

577
00:39:57,182 --> 00:40:02,165
We do our best. Maybe you'd like
to have a guest membership.

578
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:05,794
That'd be nice, kinda like
shooting guns in the house.

579
00:40:05,898 --> 00:40:08,462
Where can I send you an application?

580
00:40:08,566 --> 00:40:11,925
1603 Hillcrest.
A big white house. Beautiful place.

581
00:40:12,029 --> 00:40:15,221
We'll send it along
with the.44 shells.

582
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:17,395
Well, I'll be sure to duck.

583
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:21,141
Goodbye, Mr James.

584
00:40:21,245 --> 00:40:23,356
I guess that's my cue.

585
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,863
Excuse me.

586
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:31,997
You got a match? Damn.

587
00:40:34,505 --> 00:40:37,074
Richard James. 1603 Hillcrest Road.

588
00:40:37,178 --> 00:40:41,670
Right. Hey, Cain... you got a match?

589
00:40:44,473 --> 00:40:48,850
Here you go. Keep it.
And, Jack, don't screw this up.

590
00:40:54,149 --> 00:40:56,052
What about the cop in hospital?

591
00:40:56,156 --> 00:40:59,567
He's guarded 24 hours a day.

592
00:41:02,157 --> 00:41:05,020
Here's the impending Alphabet note.

593
00:41:05,125 --> 00:41:07,816
Will they be able
to break this one?

594
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,071
They'll crack it
when we want them to.

595
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:19,332
How'd it go?

596
00:41:20,592 --> 00:41:24,665
What would you guys say if I said
a six-foot blonde works here?

597
00:41:24,769 --> 00:41:27,755
Witnesses reported
a six-foot blonde at Adriano's.

598
00:41:27,859 --> 00:41:29,714
Axel, this isn't Detroit.

599
00:41:29,818 --> 00:41:32,840
Six-foot blonde women
grow on trees in California.

600
00:41:32,944 --> 00:41:35,091
He's right. They're everywhere.

601
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:39,680
You really need me! You can't
tell there's something weird here?

602
00:41:39,784 --> 00:41:43,602
Meet me at my house
at 1603 Hillcrest in about an hour.

603
00:41:43,706 --> 00:41:45,314
Where are my vitamins?

604
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:47,146
Oh. Your vitamins...

605
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:49,275
Here's $20. Get some more.

606
00:41:49,379 --> 00:41:52,989
- My house in an hour.
- What did he do, sell them?

607
00:42:09,266 --> 00:42:10,726
Freeze.

608
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:15,059
Damn it, Axel.
You scared the hell out of me.

609
00:42:16,398 --> 00:42:19,639
I'm sorry. I let myself in.
How you doing?

610
00:42:19,743 --> 00:42:23,142
I'm tired.
I had some work to do at the office.

611
00:42:23,247 --> 00:42:26,185
- You still at the insurance company?
- Mm-hmm.

612
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:27,648
Find anything?

613
00:42:27,752 --> 00:42:30,940
A lot of newspaper cut-outs
about oil prices dropping.

614
00:42:31,044 --> 00:42:32,858
Did you invest in oil stocks?

615
00:42:32,963 --> 00:42:35,903
On a cop's pay? No way.

616
00:42:36,007 --> 00:42:39,325
And there's an ad
for a club called 385 North.

617
00:42:39,429 --> 00:42:42,829
Is that one
of your father's hangouts?

618
00:42:42,933 --> 00:42:46,969
Your father got shot
cos he was on to something. But what?

619
00:42:48,305 --> 00:42:51,713
Do me a favour,
use your connections at your company

620
00:42:51,817 --> 00:42:54,717
to find out about
a guy named Maxwell Dent.

621
00:42:54,821 --> 00:42:56,298
I'll try.

622
00:42:56,403 --> 00:43:00,553
Listen, you can let yourself out.
I'm gonna take a shower.

623
00:43:00,657 --> 00:43:01,700
OK.

624
00:43:02,486 --> 00:43:04,360
Don't shoot nobody.

625
00:43:49,116 --> 00:43:52,401
- This has got to be a mistake.
- There's his car.

626
00:43:57,124 --> 00:43:59,911
If he's here,
he must be robbing the place.

627
00:44:03,964 --> 00:44:05,007
Axel?

628
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,183
Axel!

629
00:44:15,017 --> 00:44:17,093
I don't like this, Billy.

630
00:44:23,734 --> 00:44:24,776
Axel?

631
00:44:26,236 --> 00:44:27,851
Why would he be here?

632
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,516
Maybe the Pointer Sisters live here.

633
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,231
- Shh!
- What?!

634
00:44:32,335 --> 00:44:33,820
Out back.

635
00:44:34,953 --> 00:44:37,983
'Thank you.
Welcome to Wheel of Fortune.

636
00:44:38,088 --> 00:44:40,990
'I just thought I heard Jack say...'

637
00:44:41,094 --> 00:44:44,531
Hey!
Watch out. The deck's very slippery.

638
00:44:44,635 --> 00:44:48,747
There's beer in the refrigerator
or you can make yourself martinis.

639
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:52,915
Wait. You're on duty. No martinis.
Perrier water is what you want.

640
00:44:53,019 --> 00:44:56,421
Swimming trunks in the bedroom.
Dive in the pool.

641
00:44:56,525 --> 00:44:59,425
What are you doing
in a place like this?

642
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:01,051
What? A place like what?

643
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:05,680
- Like this. Swimming pool, jacuzzi.
- What? I'm spoiling myself rotten.

644
00:45:05,784 --> 00:45:08,851
The construction?
I am embarrassed about that.

645
00:45:08,955 --> 00:45:13,397
I'm just using the other five
bedrooms - compromising my lifestyle.

646
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:15,274
You've stolen this house.

647
00:45:15,378 --> 00:45:18,566
How can you steal a house?
It's my uncle's house.

648
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:22,609
- Is he in rock 'n' roll?
- No! Look at the big titties.

649
00:45:22,714 --> 00:45:26,200
Look at this,
titties, orange juice, beer...

650
00:45:26,305 --> 00:45:29,493
Will you put your trunks on
and get in this pool?

651
00:45:29,598 --> 00:45:33,166
I want you out of this pool and house
in seven minutes.

652
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:36,875
You're still a police officer!
You'll get us all in deep shit!

653
00:45:36,979 --> 00:45:40,298
I love when you talk dirty.
Get your mad ass in this pool.

654
00:45:40,402 --> 00:45:42,719
Axel, get out of the goddamn pool!

655
00:45:45,357 --> 00:45:47,231
I told you the deck was slippery.

656
00:45:49,486 --> 00:45:53,069
Hey, Taggart!
What's taking you so long?

657
00:45:57,953 --> 00:46:00,029
What do you think? Sharp, huh?

658
00:46:35,157 --> 00:46:38,020
Go right in, Mr President.
Relax. Have fun.

659
00:46:38,124 --> 00:46:41,980
Excuse me. Who are you?
And who are those people?

660
00:46:42,085 --> 00:46:43,862
I'm his representative.

661
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,828
That's former president
Gerald Ford there.

662
00:46:49,129 --> 00:46:51,160
It doesn't look like Gerald Ford.

663
00:46:51,265 --> 00:46:54,619
Have you seen him without make-up?
Probably not.

664
00:46:54,723 --> 00:46:57,626
This is what he looks like now,
the ex-president.

665
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:00,796
He couldn't get out
when he was running the country.

666
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,753
Now he's a civilian,
it's his right to shake his ass.

667
00:47:04,857 --> 00:47:08,428
He says, "I wanna go to 385 North,"
and I said, "Let's go."

668
00:47:08,532 --> 00:47:12,098
We came to party.
You should be proud to have him here.

669
00:47:12,202 --> 00:47:15,973
- It's our pleasure.
- Thank you very much. Excuse me.

670
00:47:16,077 --> 00:47:18,187
<i>- ~ I'm not your father ~</i>
<i>- ~ Sex ~</i>

671
00:47:18,292 --> 00:47:20,853
<i>- ~ I'm not your brother ~</i>
<i>- ~ Sex ~</i>

672
00:47:20,957 --> 00:47:23,233
<i>- ~ Talk to your sister ~</i>
<i>- ~ Sex ~</i>

673
00:47:23,337 --> 00:47:26,193
<i>- ~ I am alone ~</i>
<i>- ~ Sex ~</i>

674
00:47:26,298 --> 00:47:31,114
<i>- ~ Oo-oooh yeah ~</i>
<i>- ~ Sex ~</i>

675
00:47:31,218 --> 00:47:32,284
<i>~ Ow ~</i>

676
00:47:32,388 --> 00:47:34,451
<i>~ C-c-c-c-come on ~</i>

677
00:47:34,555 --> 00:47:36,786
<i>~ What's your definition of dirty,</i>
<i>baby? ~</i>

678
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:39,627
<i>~ Don't you think it's time</i>
<i>you had sex with me... ~</i>

679
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:43,802
- Can I have a Coke with no ice?
- One Coke, no ice, coming up.

680
00:47:47,187 --> 00:47:50,105
- There you go.
- Who's the popular blond?

681
00:47:50,941 --> 00:47:53,895
That's Nik Thomopolis.
He owns this place.

682
00:47:56,822 --> 00:48:00,405
- OK, that's seven bucks, buddy.
- For a Coke?!

683
00:48:01,493 --> 00:48:03,608
I can get blown for $7.

684
00:48:03,712 --> 00:48:05,735
<i>~ All the girls</i>
<i>go crazy over you... ~</i>

685
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:08,490
Things are getting pretty crazy, huh?

686
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,153
We're getting in deep
with Axel again.

687
00:48:11,257 --> 00:48:14,918
We'll be directing traffic
the rest of our lives anyway.

688
00:48:16,008 --> 00:48:20,081
- The hell with it. To Bogomil.
- To Bogomil.

689
00:48:20,185 --> 00:48:22,459
<i>~ Then maybe I ~</i>

690
00:48:22,563 --> 00:48:25,170
<i>~ Am what you need... ~</i>

691
00:48:25,274 --> 00:48:28,175
Drinks are on the house,
President Ford.

692
00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:31,217
What? My name's John Taggart.

693
00:48:31,321 --> 00:48:35,093
That's the name he's using now.
His marriage is breaking up.

694
00:48:35,198 --> 00:48:39,766
The judge awarded her the name
for the Betty Ford clinic and stuff.

695
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:42,645
You're much better looking in person.

696
00:48:42,749 --> 00:48:45,523
<i>~ Lovin' you, needing you ~</i>

697
00:48:45,627 --> 00:48:48,325
<i>~ Wanna make you mine, all mine ~</i>

698
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:51,528
<i>~ And that's the way it is ~</i>

699
00:48:51,632 --> 00:48:53,658
<i>~ It's a love-Iove-hate ~</i>

700
00:48:53,762 --> 00:48:55,663
<i>~ Got to love you... ~</i>

701
00:49:01,386 --> 00:49:04,084
Does the name Thomopolis
mean anything to you?

702
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:07,588
He's the biggest arms dealer
on the West coast.

703
00:49:07,693 --> 00:49:11,508
- Do I look like Gerald Ford?
- Y'all both look like Gerald Ford.

704
00:49:11,612 --> 00:49:12,926
Come on. Let's go.

705
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:14,555
<i>~ So hypnotic, baby ~</i>

706
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:17,219
<i>~ Feels so good to be yours ~</i>

707
00:49:17,323 --> 00:49:22,396
<i>~ Whoa, so let me entertain you... ~</i>

708
00:49:42,970 --> 00:49:44,012
Gun!

709
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,683
Go!

710
00:49:56,859 --> 00:49:59,017
Move it. Get out of here!

711
00:50:22,676 --> 00:50:24,752
Jesus, Billy! Come on, Axel.

712
00:50:32,603 --> 00:50:35,639
Watch yourself.
Anybody in there?

713
00:50:41,486 --> 00:50:43,479
What the fuck is going on here?

714
00:50:49,828 --> 00:50:51,815
Everybody back.

715
00:50:51,919 --> 00:50:53,787
Whoever it was got away clean.

716
00:51:00,881 --> 00:51:02,663
What are you still doing here?

717
00:51:02,767 --> 00:51:05,621
I ran a check -
there is no Johnny Wishbone.

718
00:51:05,725 --> 00:51:10,042
You're illegal. Who the hell
are you and why are you here? Now!

719
00:51:10,146 --> 00:51:13,753
I'm a cop. I didn't say before
cos I knew you'd be upset.

720
00:51:13,857 --> 00:51:17,049
It's a Detroit badge.
Why are you in Beverly Hills?

721
00:51:17,153 --> 00:51:20,843
Uh, I'm attached
to a multi-jurisdictional,

722
00:51:20,947 --> 00:51:23,722
Federal task force
on organised crime.

723
00:51:23,827 --> 00:51:27,938
And my code name...
code name is Wishbone.

724
00:51:28,042 --> 00:51:30,064
I'm the Chief of Police here,

725
00:51:30,169 --> 00:51:33,357
if there's a Federal task force,
I want to know!

726
00:51:33,461 --> 00:51:38,072
You can call back to Detroit tomorrow
and ask for an Inspector Todd.

727
00:51:38,177 --> 00:51:42,324
He'll tell you all about it.
My real name is Axel Foley.

728
00:51:42,429 --> 00:51:46,285
Call there between the hours
of nine and ten, Detroit time,

729
00:51:46,389 --> 00:51:47,872
he'll tell you everything.

730
00:51:47,976 --> 00:51:52,098
Right now, I have the rest of my case
to finish, so excuse me.

731
00:51:54,726 --> 00:51:57,967
And you two,
what the hell were you doing here?

732
00:51:58,071 --> 00:52:00,343
Checking parking meters in the area?

733
00:52:00,448 --> 00:52:04,053
- Well, sir, uh...
- We're off duty, sir. I live nearby.

734
00:52:04,158 --> 00:52:08,392
Now, listen, if you do
anything except traffic duty,

735
00:52:08,496 --> 00:52:11,687
I'll have you both
investigated and suspended!

736
00:52:11,791 --> 00:52:15,731
Well, sir, technically,
this is traffic duty.

737
00:52:15,835 --> 00:52:19,959
Technically, you're a goddamn idiot.
Get out of here, Taggart!

738
00:52:21,837 --> 00:52:23,414
- Yes, sir.
- Jesus Christ!

739
00:52:31,597 --> 00:52:34,218
- Are you sure you got Super glue?
- Yeah.

740
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:38,258
Yo, man, this is Wild Kingdom.

741
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:41,133
I tried to create
a stress-free environment.

742
00:52:41,238 --> 00:52:42,763
Well, you have.

743
00:52:42,867 --> 00:52:47,680
These are my friends.
That's Sidney. He's a wandering Jew.

744
00:52:47,785 --> 00:52:49,766
And this is Mona.

745
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:53,644
Hi, baby. They actually like
different kinds of music.

746
00:52:53,748 --> 00:52:56,485
If I play the Beatles,
the begonias perk up.

747
00:52:56,589 --> 00:52:59,194
If I play Beethoven, they wither.

748
00:52:59,298 --> 00:53:01,905
The ferns like the Boston Pops.

749
00:53:02,009 --> 00:53:04,042
But everybody loves Mozart.

750
00:53:05,547 --> 00:53:06,792
Who's this?

751
00:53:07,883 --> 00:53:11,790
Big Al. Had him about six years.
Isn't he great?

752
00:53:11,894 --> 00:53:13,835
What kind of music does he like?

753
00:53:13,939 --> 00:53:19,047
- James Brown. Drives him nuts.
- Is that turtle shit in there?

754
00:53:19,151 --> 00:53:22,052
You know, turtles are amazing to me.

755
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,050
Hey, what are you doing?

756
00:53:24,154 --> 00:53:28,011
I'm curious to know
where his dick is at.

757
00:53:28,116 --> 00:53:31,852
Give me him. You know where it is,
don't you, Big Al?

758
00:53:31,956 --> 00:53:35,273
- Do turtles have dicks?
- How's it hanging, Big Al?

759
00:53:35,377 --> 00:53:38,399
- Give me that Super glue.
- OK.

760
00:53:38,503 --> 00:53:42,404
Billy's really... out there,
isn't he, Axel?

761
00:53:42,508 --> 00:53:44,707
Yeah, Billy's pretty fucked up.

762
00:53:47,047 --> 00:53:49,538
- I heard that.
- I know. I was joking!

763
00:53:50,634 --> 00:53:52,923
Give me the Super glue.

764
00:54:04,648 --> 00:54:06,347
What's that music from?

765
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,517
- The Dating Game.
- Yeah!

766
00:54:17,828 --> 00:54:20,497
Let's give Billy
a big Dating Game kiss.

767
00:54:21,248 --> 00:54:23,234
- Where's your phone?
- Bedroom.

768
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:25,456
Where, in the alligator pit?

769
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:39,762
Jesus, Billy.

770
00:54:51,278 --> 00:54:53,393
- Y'ello?
- 'Jeff? Yeah, Axel.'

771
00:54:53,497 --> 00:54:55,974
Axel. Axel, it's one in the morning.

772
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,983
Jeffrey, stop talking.
How's the Ferrari?

773
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:02,402
Great. What a great car!
Do those seats go back?

774
00:55:02,506 --> 00:55:05,444
I was with Marcy trying
to get the seats back...

775
00:55:05,548 --> 00:55:07,823
You can't do freaky shit in that car.

776
00:55:07,927 --> 00:55:10,911
You have to do something for me -
you won't like it.

777
00:55:11,015 --> 00:55:12,827
Am I going to get in trouble?

778
00:55:12,931 --> 00:55:16,122
- You see that?
- Weird, huh?

779
00:55:16,226 --> 00:55:18,040
It's not weird. It's simple.

780
00:55:18,144 --> 00:55:22,599
The fumes from the Super glue attach
to the acid from the fingerprints.

781
00:55:23,727 --> 00:55:27,340
It's a street cop trick.
Hasn't filtered down to you boys yet.

782
00:55:27,444 --> 00:55:29,221
Now we have to match it.

783
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:32,179
- We could use the computer downtown.
- No.

784
00:55:32,284 --> 00:55:35,768
There won't be anybody
there this time of night, Sarge.

785
00:55:35,873 --> 00:55:38,811
Oh, shit.
There goes my medical insurance.

786
00:55:38,915 --> 00:55:42,771
- You can be such a pussy sometimes.
- Really.

787
00:55:42,875 --> 00:55:44,698
Let's go. Come on.

788
00:55:50,045 --> 00:55:53,075
You boys definitely
get an A in High-tech.

789
00:55:53,179 --> 00:55:56,423
It takes 60 cops
to do this shit in Detroit.

790
00:55:58,846 --> 00:56:02,428
Charles Cain.
Used to be Charles Campos.

791
00:56:04,768 --> 00:56:08,592
I just met this guy. He works
in the Beverly Hills gun club.

792
00:56:08,696 --> 00:56:10,387
- He does?
- Yeah.

793
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,096
This ain't the guy - he's a weasel.

794
00:56:13,201 --> 00:56:16,889
- This isn't a master criminal.
- That's his print.

795
00:56:16,993 --> 00:56:20,480
This guy had nothing to do
with Bogomil getting shot.

796
00:56:20,584 --> 00:56:23,484
If he suspected him,
he would've picked him up.

797
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,859
Well, let's put an APB out on Cain.

798
00:56:25,963 --> 00:56:30,324
We can't. All we got is fingerprints.
We need something else.

799
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:34,453
- What do we do now?
- Let's go to the gun club.

800
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:37,994
Wait. It's 11:00.
The gun club's closed.

801
00:56:38,098 --> 00:56:40,216
- So?
- So?

802
00:56:52,316 --> 00:56:55,640
This is a big mistake. A big mistake.

803
00:56:55,744 --> 00:56:59,310
It's breaking the law. Once we cross
the line, there's no way back.

804
00:56:59,414 --> 00:57:01,074
I'll go.

805
00:57:02,367 --> 00:57:03,605
I'll go.

806
00:57:03,709 --> 00:57:07,201
See? Would you lighten up
and take some risks?

807
00:57:11,502 --> 00:57:13,293
Fuck it. Let's go.

808
00:57:35,275 --> 00:57:37,057
Oh, shit. Alarm tape.

809
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,359
There are ways around alarm tape.

810
00:57:41,406 --> 00:57:43,271
If we open this door now,

811
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:46,275
the connection will break
between the magnets.

812
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:47,940
If we use this foil,

813
00:57:48,044 --> 00:57:52,323
and you squeeze it
between the two magnets,

814
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:55,159
then take your gum
to hold it in place.

815
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:59,909
Now the magnets have the illusion
that the connection's not broken.

816
00:58:00,014 --> 00:58:02,048
Then we take our knife...

817
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:07,932
open the door without...

818
00:58:12,354 --> 00:58:14,968
We walk in
without the alarm going off.

819
00:58:15,072 --> 00:58:16,469
You've done that before.

820
00:58:16,573 --> 00:58:21,600
I wasn't always a police officer,
I fractured a law or two as a kid.

821
00:58:21,704 --> 00:58:23,100
Can I have a piece?

822
00:58:23,204 --> 00:58:25,357
- It's my last one.
- Split it.

823
00:58:29,496 --> 00:58:31,204
None for you.

824
00:58:49,057 --> 00:58:52,473
- What are we looking for?
- A needle in a haystack.

825
00:58:54,396 --> 00:58:56,472
Give me some light over here.

826
00:59:00,777 --> 00:59:01,820
Shit.

827
00:59:03,989 --> 00:59:06,492
Here you go.

828
00:59:07,034 --> 00:59:08,771
- What is that?
- What?

829
00:59:08,875 --> 00:59:09,978
That knife.

830
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:14,372
- It's mine. Home protection.
- Billy, we gotta talk.

831
00:59:16,919 --> 00:59:18,995
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

832
00:59:22,049 --> 00:59:25,079
- What is that?
- A needle in a haystack.

833
00:59:25,183 --> 00:59:27,004
Map coordinates?

834
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:57,818
Hello?

835
00:59:57,922 --> 01:00:00,781
Is this Inspector Todd
of the Detroit Police?

836
01:00:00,885 --> 01:00:02,661
Yes, it is.

837
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:06,580
I'm sorry to be bothering you,
my name is Lionel Hand,

838
01:00:06,684 --> 01:00:09,418
I'm with
the FBI Enforcement Bulletin.

839
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:12,959
- 'I read it all the time.'
- Thanks. We're proud of it.

840
01:00:13,063 --> 01:00:14,590
Don't touch the leather.

841
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,132
My director has asked me to interview

842
01:00:17,236 --> 01:00:20,009
an exceptional
law enforcement officer,

843
01:00:20,113 --> 01:00:22,554
and your name came up
on our computer.

844
01:00:22,658 --> 01:00:23,844
Is that right?

845
01:00:23,948 --> 01:00:25,347
This is short notice,

846
01:00:25,452 --> 01:00:29,563
but could you meet me this morning
for breakfast at my office?

847
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,644
'How's nine o'clock?'

848
01:00:31,749 --> 01:00:33,730
Yeah, uh-huh. I'll be there.

849
01:00:33,834 --> 01:00:35,868
Thank you. My pleasure.

850
01:00:52,389 --> 01:00:53,432
Ring.

851
01:00:57,102 --> 01:00:59,133
Here's your coffee, sir.

852
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:02,720
Just once a week, I'd like tea.
Do you know what I mean?

853
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,023
- Yes, sir.
- That too much to ask?

854
01:01:06,695 --> 01:01:08,853
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

855
01:01:12,284 --> 01:01:14,360
OK, damn it, who tricked my ass?

856
01:01:15,996 --> 01:01:20,076
- 440...
- Don't confuse me when I'm dialling.

857
01:01:25,339 --> 01:01:26,532
This is Todd.

858
01:01:26,636 --> 01:01:29,201
- 'Inspector Todd?'
- That's what I said.

859
01:01:29,305 --> 01:01:33,873
This is Harold Lutz. I'm chief of
the Beverly Hills Police Department.

860
01:01:33,978 --> 01:01:36,375
'Do you have an officer
Axel Foley...'

861
01:01:36,479 --> 01:01:40,049
Yes, he's under my command,
but he's assigned to some

862
01:01:40,154 --> 01:01:43,553
multi-jurisdictional,
Federal task force.

863
01:01:43,657 --> 01:01:47,178
I never know where the hell he is.
It's a real pain.

864
01:01:47,283 --> 01:01:51,056
I can't control him.
He reports directly to the Feds.

865
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,688
I have to go now.

866
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:55,618
What the hell are you doing in here?

867
01:01:57,454 --> 01:02:00,989
- This is not my office.
- You damn right it isn't.

868
01:02:08,423 --> 01:02:11,332
I want to see if these
coordinates intercept.

869
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:14,214
What makes you think
they mean anything?

870
01:02:22,229 --> 01:02:24,926
9752 Gregory Way.

871
01:02:25,031 --> 01:02:28,220
- City Deposit.
- What's City Deposit?

872
01:02:28,325 --> 01:02:31,226
It's where banks take their money.

873
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:34,026
I bet that's the next place
that gets hit.

874
01:03:19,495 --> 01:03:22,025
Unit 21, handle. Unit 22, assist.

875
01:03:22,129 --> 01:03:24,608
City Deposit, 341 Gregory.

876
01:03:24,712 --> 01:03:27,239
Lines are down. Unable to verify.

877
01:03:27,343 --> 01:03:29,293
Can't this car go any faster?

878
01:03:35,135 --> 01:03:36,178
Hey!

879
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:40,430
Come on, guys. Come on.

880
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:43,426
- Looks good.
- I got it.

881
01:03:44,269 --> 01:03:47,677
Out of the hole. Come on. Move it.

882
01:03:47,781 --> 01:03:49,260
Let's do it.

883
01:03:49,364 --> 01:03:50,686
OK, here we go.

884
01:03:57,616 --> 01:03:59,407
Two... one...

885
01:04:10,671 --> 01:04:12,951
Three minutes!

886
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,951
Sarge, relax and trust me.

887
01:04:15,055 --> 01:04:18,834
- You drive worse than Maureen.
- No way!

888
01:04:22,891 --> 01:04:24,516
Where's the seat belt?!

889
01:04:34,361 --> 01:04:36,733
- It's a red light!
- It's green!

890
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:42,484
- It was red, OK.
- It was yellow!

891
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:49,459
2:30.

892
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,038
Construction.

893
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:02,378
Aw, shit!

894
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:08,390
- Hey, Taggart, you coming?
- I'm coming! Don't wait for me.

895
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:15,435
Two minutes.

896
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:22,480
Yo, man, what's that for?

897
01:05:22,584 --> 01:05:26,566
After the club shootout,
I figured I needed more firepower.

898
01:05:26,671 --> 01:05:28,195
We gotta talk.

899
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:31,741
Who do you think you are?
Clint Eastwood? Dirty Rosewood?

900
01:05:33,962 --> 01:05:35,005
1:30.

901
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:42,376
Hey! Sound the alarm.
You got a break-in.

902
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,179
I need authorisation.

903
01:05:47,351 --> 01:05:48,422
Authorised!

904
01:05:48,526 --> 01:05:51,759
Fuck! Get out of here!

905
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,812
Come on! Go! Go! Go!

906
01:05:56,151 --> 01:05:58,856
Get out! Get out! Go!

907
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:19,582
Hey, Rosewood, get some wheels.

908
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:43,350
Well, this is pretty sporty

909
01:06:43,455 --> 01:06:45,646
It's all I could find.

910
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:47,940
<i>~ If you stick with me, baby... ~</i>

911
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:49,288
Billy!

912
01:06:49,496 --> 01:06:51,111
<i>~ I won't do you wrong ~</i>

913
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:54,077
<i>~ And we're gonna have some fun... ~</i>

914
01:06:55,919 --> 01:07:00,453
Police business! I need your car!
I'm a police officer!

915
01:07:00,557 --> 01:07:02,369
<i>~ You can't count on anyone... ~</i>

916
01:07:02,474 --> 01:07:05,801
Oh, God. Here I go again.

917
01:07:08,932 --> 01:07:10,972
Come on, let's go!

918
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,969
- You just hit a squad car!
- It's OK. I know the guy.

919
01:07:20,074 --> 01:07:21,444
He's a jerk!

920
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,729
<i>~ Lay it on the line ~</i>

921
01:07:25,834 --> 01:07:27,772
<i>~ And I'm saying my last prayer ~</i>

922
01:07:27,876 --> 01:07:30,275
<i>~ I know you're gonna be there... ~</i>

923
01:07:36,877 --> 01:07:37,920
Whoa!

924
01:07:40,422 --> 01:07:43,340
- Does the steering wheel work?
- I'm steering!

925
01:07:50,224 --> 01:07:53,059
- Do the brakes work?
- I haven't tried them yet.

926
01:07:59,858 --> 01:08:02,563
Ah, shit, we should have went left.

927
01:08:04,112 --> 01:08:05,728
<i>~ Got my Continental ~</i>

928
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:08,278
<i>~ Jam it to the floor... ~</i>

929
01:08:23,257 --> 01:08:25,133
Oh, fuck!

930
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:27,541
<i>~ And I'm saying my last prayer ~</i>

931
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:29,335
<i>~ I know you're gonna be there ~</i>

932
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,751
<i>~ Be there... ~</i>

933
01:08:30,855 --> 01:08:35,344
Are you driving with your eyes open,
or are you, like, using the Force?

934
01:08:39,648 --> 01:08:42,056
Stop! There's the truck.

935
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:10,302
Now what?

936
01:09:16,435 --> 01:09:18,549
This was the pick-up vehicle.

937
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,389
Let's follow it.

938
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:38,697
Sarge? You old bloodhound!

939
01:09:38,801 --> 01:09:41,116
- Billy, isn't this, uh...
- Yeah.

940
01:09:42,169 --> 01:09:43,212
No!

941
01:09:54,848 --> 01:09:57,546
What the fuck is up, man?
Check this out.

942
01:09:57,650 --> 01:10:01,256
I get $10 for cars,
I get $20 for limos.

943
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,137
What the hell is this?

944
01:10:03,241 --> 01:10:04,726
My truck.

945
01:10:05,859 --> 01:10:09,477
Here's $50. Put it next to a limo.

946
01:10:12,866 --> 01:10:15,155
Let me call you back, OK?

947
01:10:16,078 --> 01:10:18,692
- I'm here to clean the pool.
- Your name?

948
01:10:18,796 --> 01:10:22,529
- I'm the pool cleaner.
- The pool was cleaned yesterday.

949
01:10:22,633 --> 01:10:27,282
It WAS clean. Today it's dirty.
Somebody made a mistake in the pool.

950
01:10:27,386 --> 01:10:29,118
What do you mean by "mistake"?

951
01:10:29,222 --> 01:10:31,414
Someone had a little...

952
01:10:31,518 --> 01:10:34,207
- uh, accident in the pool.
- Accident?

953
01:10:34,312 --> 01:10:36,707
There's something floating
in the pool.

954
01:10:36,811 --> 01:10:39,127
- What?
- During some wild party,

955
01:10:39,231 --> 01:10:41,379
somebody got drunk
and shit in the pool.

956
01:10:41,483 --> 01:10:43,881
- I'm here to clean it up.
- I see, uh...

957
01:10:43,985 --> 01:10:46,383
I ain't happy about it,
but it's my job.

958
01:10:46,487 --> 01:10:50,013
You write names down, I clean pools.
Where's the pool at?

959
01:10:50,117 --> 01:10:52,060
Who are these gentlemen with you?

960
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:53,771
The Board of Health.

961
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:57,106
They're making sure
I do the job thoroughly.

962
01:10:57,211 --> 01:11:01,525
If you like, I can bring it by
and you can verify it afterwards.

963
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:04,197
- No, that's fine.
- Excuse me.

964
01:11:08,881 --> 01:11:13,414
<i>~ Hold on, I'm the one</i>
<i>who loves you... ~</i>

965
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:16,048
Jesus Christ!

966
01:11:17,222 --> 01:11:21,378
<i>~ Hold on to the one who loves you ~</i>

967
01:11:21,483 --> 01:11:24,135
Wake up! This is what
we always talked about.

968
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:26,260
Look alive.
You may never see it again.

969
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:28,593
I don't want to step
on your tongues.

970
01:11:28,697 --> 01:11:30,762
Why aren't my parties like this?

971
01:11:30,866 --> 01:11:33,613
You gotta die sometime.
Might as well be here.

972
01:11:35,032 --> 01:11:39,149
<i>~ No mystery,</i>
<i>I'm in love with you... ~</i>

973
01:11:39,254 --> 01:11:40,776
What are we doing?

974
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,068
Whoever took that truck
is here somewhere.

975
01:11:44,172 --> 01:11:47,113
How are we supposed to find them?

976
01:11:47,217 --> 01:11:49,168
Follow your dick.

977
01:11:56,011 --> 01:11:58,248
That's the girl from the gun club.

978
01:11:58,352 --> 01:12:01,680
- With Dent and Thomopolis?
- Yeah, that big bitch.

979
01:12:07,814 --> 01:12:10,300
Max! How'd you get in here?

980
01:12:10,405 --> 01:12:13,558
Forget I asked.
I see how, it's the suit.

981
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,141
Nice suit, Max.

982
01:12:15,245 --> 01:12:19,606
- This person is annoying us.
- May I see your invitation?

983
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:22,776
- I haven't begun to annoy you.
- What's going on?

984
01:12:22,881 --> 01:12:26,989
It's Max. Check your guest list
cos Max ain't supposed to be here.

985
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:28,821
Are we having a problem?

986
01:12:28,925 --> 01:12:32,032
Hef! Hugh Hefner! Axel Foley!

987
01:12:32,137 --> 01:12:37,202
I feel like I know you already cos
I put your magazine up... Forget it.

988
01:12:37,306 --> 01:12:39,916
Here's some background
on your guests.

989
01:12:40,021 --> 01:12:42,793
This is Thomopolis,
he's into guns and drugs.

990
01:12:42,897 --> 01:12:48,130
And this is Max
and Max kills cops for a living.

991
01:12:48,234 --> 01:12:50,889
Well, I don't know him. Or you.

992
01:12:50,993 --> 01:12:55,889
- I think it's time all of you left.
- I happen to be a major contributor.

993
01:12:55,993 --> 01:12:57,770
We appreciate it. Goodbye.

994
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:01,022
He appreciates it, Max,
but take your ass home.

995
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:03,316
You outdone your welcome.

996
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:07,780
But it's been real, it's been nice.
Everybody, party's over!

997
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:11,742
Max fucked it up for everybody,
so let's just go home.

998
01:13:13,881 --> 01:13:15,701
We'll go ahead as planned.

999
01:13:15,805 --> 01:13:18,540
Get Cain to prepare E.

1000
01:13:18,645 --> 01:13:22,715
<i>~ Hold on cos I'm on my way ~</i>

1001
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:29,716
- You picked Dent's pocket?
- Ho!

1002
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:32,177
I told y'all
I wasn't always a cop.

1003
01:13:32,281 --> 01:13:35,515
Yeah, you fractured an occasional law
as a kid.

1004
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:39,140
This is not good. This is not good.

1005
01:13:39,244 --> 01:13:43,063
See? Every now and then,
an occasional long shot pays off.

1006
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,562
Dent's accountant, Sidney Bernstein.

1007
01:13:45,667 --> 01:13:49,780
Anything Dent's into, he'll have
a record. We'll visit him tomorrow.

1008
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:51,784
It's all we got to go on.

1009
01:13:56,924 --> 01:13:59,748
There's no B and D,
I'm looking for something.

1010
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:02,041
And what about that cement truck?

1011
01:14:02,145 --> 01:14:04,706
What about that, Rosewood?
Talk to me!

1012
01:14:04,811 --> 01:14:06,709
I have a theory on that, Chief.

1013
01:14:06,814 --> 01:14:09,809
I think the cement truck
was a tactical decoy.

1014
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:11,839
A decoy?

1015
01:14:11,943 --> 01:14:14,930
A diversion to protect
the criminals' getaway.

1016
01:14:15,034 --> 01:14:17,472
That's why it rammed the police car.

1017
01:14:17,577 --> 01:14:20,561
Have you submitted yourself
for drug testing yet?

1018
01:14:20,665 --> 01:14:23,058
I want you in by Thursday.
Understand?

1019
01:14:23,162 --> 01:14:26,066
Are you aware that
whoever was in that truck

1020
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:28,276
foiled the goddamn crime?

1021
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,530
- Are you?
- Putz.

1022
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:35,034
- Did you say something?
- He called you Putz.

1023
01:14:35,138 --> 01:14:37,205
No, I called you a putz.

1024
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:40,545
He's right... putz.

1025
01:14:42,135 --> 01:14:46,708
And you. You, Mr Scribbler... What
the hell were you doing there, Foley?

1026
01:14:46,812 --> 01:14:49,209
Hey, aren't I
a police officer, too?

1027
01:14:49,313 --> 01:14:50,796
Remains to be seen.

1028
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:53,175
Did you call Inspector Todd for me?

1029
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:55,802
I did. He doesn't like you very much.

1030
01:14:55,907 --> 01:14:58,346
- OK...
- Hear this insubordination?

1031
01:14:58,451 --> 01:15:03,266
Yes, and I've never heard such abuse.
Whatever's happened, the fact remains

1032
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:06,562
that the robbery was foiled
and the money was saved.

1033
01:15:06,666 --> 01:15:10,234
If I were you, I'd concentrate
on cracking this code

1034
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,900
and determining where
the E crime will be.

1035
01:15:13,004 --> 01:15:16,778
There's not many targets
beginning with E, so find them.

1036
01:15:16,883 --> 01:15:18,865
- I will, Ted.
- Mayor!

1037
01:15:18,969 --> 01:15:20,791
Yes, Mayor.

1038
01:15:24,344 --> 01:15:27,252
And you! I want you out of here!

1039
01:15:27,357 --> 01:15:29,334
Get out of here, you degenerate!

1040
01:15:29,438 --> 01:15:32,268
You're not even
part of this department!

1041
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:35,889
- Is this a black thing?
- Out.

1042
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:45,602
Weren't you supposed
to leave for Detroit?

1043
01:15:45,706 --> 01:15:49,689
- Yeah, today at noon.
- Well, you're not gonna make it.

1044
01:15:49,794 --> 01:15:51,607
You're gonna get fired.

1045
01:15:51,711 --> 01:15:54,862
We started this together,
we'll finish together.

1046
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,081
Check if Bernstein owns a car.

1047
01:15:59,713 --> 01:16:01,699
- Give me a pen.
- Oh, Axel...

1048
01:16:01,804 --> 01:16:04,035
- Give me a pen!
- '86 Mercedes.

1049
01:16:04,139 --> 01:16:07,550
License number CRL 507.

1050
01:16:14,478 --> 01:16:16,592
Naturally, I can see... Yeah...

1051
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:19,347
I mean, I understand.
Somebody... Wait...

1052
01:16:19,452 --> 01:16:23,016
Come right in! Don't let the fact
that my door's closed

1053
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,597
dissuade you from entering my office.

1054
01:16:25,702 --> 01:16:28,894
Beverly Pills Police.
Are you Mr Sidney Bernstein?

1055
01:16:28,999 --> 01:16:30,102
Yes. Lucky guess.

1056
01:16:30,206 --> 01:16:33,776
You have 25 unpaid tickets.
We have a warrant for your arrest.

1057
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:37,818
- 25? What 25?
- You have 25 unpaid parking tickets.

1058
01:16:37,922 --> 01:16:40,826
I pay my tickets.
I pay all my tickets.

1059
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:45,289
Do you own a black Mercedes-Benz,
license plate number CRL 507?

1060
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:48,330
507? That's my wife's car.
That's not my car.

1061
01:16:48,435 --> 01:16:49,960
You have 25 tickets.

1062
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:54,089
It's under my name, but it's
my wife's car! No, no, no! Bitch!

1063
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:58,591
These tickets haven't been paid.
Can you cuff Mr Bernstein?

1064
01:16:58,695 --> 01:17:01,175
There are people out
there with chainsaws!

1065
01:17:01,279 --> 01:17:05,098
You have unpaid tickets and
it's your car. We're taking you in.

1066
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:11,061
Wait. I've got an idea. Is there
something that I have in this office

1067
01:17:11,166 --> 01:17:15,693
that I could hand to you and
that would make you kind of forget

1068
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:19,529
that you're holding those
little pink tickets there?

1069
01:17:19,634 --> 01:17:21,113
What are you saying?

1070
01:17:21,217 --> 01:17:25,534
You'd have something in that hand
and this hand you'd forget about.

1071
01:17:25,639 --> 01:17:29,750
That hand you'd go, "What did
I have there? I don't remember."

1072
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:31,802
You mean if I had, um...

1073
01:17:34,266 --> 01:17:36,419
$200 in this hand?

1074
01:17:36,523 --> 01:17:38,588
Ouch! Let go of my arm.

1075
01:17:38,692 --> 01:17:43,759
$200? Ouch! Please, I'm robbing you.
That's what I'm doing.

1076
01:17:43,863 --> 01:17:46,889
Here's one, here's two.
They're real crisp.

1077
01:17:46,993 --> 01:17:53,186
I have to use your computer to wipe
all evidence of this transaction out.

1078
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:55,355
No problem. No problem at all.

1079
01:17:55,459 --> 01:17:57,024
Thank you, Sidney, so much.

1080
01:17:57,128 --> 01:17:58,986
Oh, certainly. Certainly.

1081
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,530
- Also, one other thing.
- Yes?

1082
01:18:01,634 --> 01:18:03,197
I'm sure you understand

1083
01:18:03,301 --> 01:18:07,074
my contact at headquarters
wouldn't want his name to be known.

1084
01:18:07,178 --> 01:18:10,953
- Don't I know it.
- Could you excuse me while I...

1085
01:18:11,057 --> 01:18:13,001
Oh, yeah, it's secretive.

1086
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:15,711
It's like a James Bond thing!
Yes, yes.

1087
01:18:15,815 --> 01:18:17,755
- Thank you.
- No problem!

1088
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,798
No problem at all.
Anything you want to use.

1089
01:18:20,902 --> 01:18:24,561
- I can't believe...
- I don't want to hear it, Billy.

1090
01:18:37,663 --> 01:18:40,609
- Hey, Jan, Axel. How you doing?
- 'Hi, Axel.'

1091
01:18:40,714 --> 01:18:41,900
What do you got?

1092
01:18:42,005 --> 01:18:45,491
Strange. Before 1978,
everything's blank.

1093
01:18:45,596 --> 01:18:49,788
'It's classified,
but its policy date is 1974.'

1094
01:18:49,893 --> 01:18:52,369
I checked our foreign office
in London

1095
01:18:52,473 --> 01:18:54,584
and found something very interesting.

1096
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:59,213
'Dent was the cultural attaché to
the East German embassy in Honduras.'

1097
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:03,005
He's got a racetrack, shooting club,

1098
01:19:03,109 --> 01:19:06,135
drilling rig companies,
an oil company.

1099
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:09,474
- Oil company?
- 'That's his biggest business.'

1100
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:13,183
But from these records,
seems like Dent's in trouble.

1101
01:19:13,287 --> 01:19:17,733
'He's let his insurance lapse on
everything in the last six months.'

1102
01:19:17,837 --> 01:19:20,691
Dent Petroleum,
even the shooting club.

1103
01:19:20,795 --> 01:19:23,320
All his businesses except one.

1104
01:19:23,424 --> 01:19:27,367
- Which one is that?
- 'The racetrack. Empyrean Fields.'

1105
01:19:29,339 --> 01:19:31,742
He's got a huge policy on that one.

1106
01:19:31,846 --> 01:19:35,371
Good, good, good, good, good.
OK. Great.

1107
01:19:35,476 --> 01:19:37,918
Hey, when your father wakes up...

1108
01:19:38,022 --> 01:19:40,295
'He's better. He's up and around.'

1109
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:42,794
- 'Tell him you found his man.'
- OK.

1110
01:19:42,899 --> 01:19:44,093
Bye-bye.

1111
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,975
Empyrean Fields.

1112
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:55,561
- Rip off his own racetrack?
- Yes, if it's insured.

1113
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:56,978
What was in the files?

1114
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:59,734
We won't find oil field equipment
if we find Dent.

1115
01:19:59,839 --> 01:20:01,232
IF we find him?

1116
01:20:01,336 --> 01:20:04,487
Dent's visa to Costa Rico
had today's date on it.

1117
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:06,955
If we don't step on it,
he's out of here.

1118
01:20:16,345 --> 01:20:21,167
I, uh... I don't know what happened
on the City Deposit, Max.

1119
01:20:21,271 --> 01:20:22,891
And the Foley hit?

1120
01:20:24,061 --> 01:20:25,472
I don't know.

1121
01:20:27,981 --> 01:20:31,389
That's why I need you
to go along personally

1122
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:33,849
to make certain nothing goes wrong.

1123
01:20:33,953 --> 01:20:36,437
I'm on the team, of course.

1124
01:20:46,875 --> 01:20:49,617
Hey, hey, hey. I broke it.

1125
01:20:49,721 --> 01:20:52,703
You son of a bitch.
You beat the computer?

1126
01:20:52,807 --> 01:20:57,332
- What's it say?
- "Chinguen sus puercos, Carlos."

1127
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:59,830
Screw you cops. Signed, Carlos.

1128
01:20:59,934 --> 01:21:03,209
- Puercos ain't cops.
- Pigs. Another word for cops.

1129
01:21:03,314 --> 01:21:06,632
Wait a minute, Carlos?
It is Cain. Charles Cain.

1130
01:21:06,737 --> 01:21:08,760
Carlos is Spanish for Charles.

1131
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:12,679
Cain changed his name.
He didn't want to grow up to be poor.

1132
01:21:12,783 --> 01:21:16,471
- Cain is the Alphabet robber?
- I ain't said that.

1133
01:21:16,576 --> 01:21:19,435
The first code was very hard.
This is easy.

1134
01:21:19,539 --> 01:21:22,102
Whoever did this
wanted the cops to get it.

1135
01:21:22,206 --> 01:21:23,984
You ran numbers, too?

1136
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:28,077
- I wasn't always a cop.
- He fractured an occasional law.

1137
01:22:16,465 --> 01:22:20,593
'The horses have now
reached the starting gate.'

1138
01:22:25,974 --> 01:22:28,338
Freeze! Hit the floor!

1139
01:22:28,442 --> 01:22:30,392
Freeze, God damn it!

1140
01:22:32,731 --> 01:22:33,774
1:30.

1141
01:22:41,114 --> 01:22:42,157
1:15.

1142
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:54,490
30 seconds.

1143
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:02,302
Time!

1144
01:23:10,894 --> 01:23:12,638
Goodbye, Mr Cain.

1145
01:23:23,991 --> 01:23:25,938
'...winning it by a nose.

1146
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:29,941
'The General was second
and Marshall's Madness came third.'

1147
01:23:30,046 --> 01:23:32,947
I'm afraid our horse didn't come in.

1148
01:23:33,051 --> 01:23:34,701
Cain's did.

1149
01:23:40,507 --> 01:23:44,042
'The result is now official.
The winner, Johnny's Dilemma...'

1150
01:23:54,271 --> 01:23:57,058
- Police officers!
- Police!

1151
01:24:07,201 --> 01:24:08,778
We're a little late.

1152
01:24:14,374 --> 01:24:17,488
All I can tell you now
is that we are confident

1153
01:24:17,592 --> 01:24:20,865
that we have identified
the Alphabet Bandit.

1154
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:24,205
The man was shot dead
at the scene this morning

1155
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:26,454
by security guard Jack Stiles.

1156
01:24:26,558 --> 01:24:30,587
In his latest robbery attempt,
the man was fatally wounded.

1157
01:24:30,692 --> 01:24:35,255
So I give you my oath right here
there will be no F crime.

1158
01:24:35,359 --> 01:24:36,719
My own computer team

1159
01:24:36,823 --> 01:24:41,597
personally cracked the Alphabet
Bandit's code this afternoon.

1160
01:24:41,702 --> 01:24:46,016
All of the notes, mind you,
were signed "Carlos", right?

1161
01:24:46,121 --> 01:24:51,020
Carlos. Carlos, which, as you all
know, is Spanish for Charles.

1162
01:24:51,125 --> 01:24:53,273
Do you hear what I'm saying?

1163
01:24:53,377 --> 01:24:55,941
If Cain's the man, where's the money?

1164
01:24:56,045 --> 01:24:57,445
Where's Dent?

1165
01:24:57,549 --> 01:25:00,994
- You said shipping oil equipment.
- But how? Where?

1166
01:25:03,257 --> 01:25:06,536
- Let's put an APB out on Dent.
- For what reason?

1167
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:08,924
- Hey, where'd you get that?
- What?

1168
01:25:10,389 --> 01:25:12,631
It's coming from there.

1169
01:25:16,478 --> 01:25:19,508
Excuse me.
How did the mud get on the horse?

1170
01:25:19,613 --> 01:25:21,804
He was grazing in the pasture.

1171
01:25:21,909 --> 01:25:26,646
- Where's the pasture at?
- There. Dent's oil field.

1172
01:25:37,457 --> 01:25:40,737
Bogomil had that red mud
on his sneakers.

1173
01:25:40,841 --> 01:25:44,576
Maybe he got a tip, he came here
and they tried to waste him.

1174
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:46,576
Who pulled the Alphabet jobs?

1175
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:48,828
Dent's going broke, OK?

1176
01:25:48,932 --> 01:25:52,041
So he heists some bank,
heists some jewellery,

1177
01:25:52,145 --> 01:25:55,169
then throws this easy code
with Cain's name on it.

1178
01:25:55,273 --> 01:25:58,047
Simple. You frame Cain, kill Cain,

1179
01:25:58,151 --> 01:26:01,591
Cain's the Alphabet killer,
Dent gets away scot-free.

1180
01:26:01,695 --> 01:26:05,636
Why would an oil man risk this,
even if he was broke?

1181
01:26:05,740 --> 01:26:09,809
Dent's not buying oil equipment,
he's buying guns from Thomopolis.

1182
01:26:09,913 --> 01:26:12,565
Probably selling them
in Central America.

1183
01:26:12,670 --> 01:26:14,646
Why not split with the cash?

1184
01:26:14,750 --> 01:26:18,440
Dent buys guns here for a million
and sells them there for 10 million.

1185
01:26:18,544 --> 01:26:21,071
Look at all that oil.

1186
01:26:21,175 --> 01:26:22,792
I don't see oil.

1187
01:26:24,004 --> 01:26:25,463
I see trucks.

1188
01:26:40,437 --> 01:26:42,258
Come on, Billy.

1189
01:26:42,362 --> 01:26:44,592
Billy, what are you doing?

1190
01:26:44,697 --> 01:26:48,432
I've been wanting to wear this
for a while, Sarge.

1191
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:51,891
What, are you nuts?
Christ, Billy, we gotta talk.

1192
01:26:51,996 --> 01:26:53,855
What the hell is this?

1193
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,187
You can never have
too much firepower.

1194
01:26:56,292 --> 01:26:59,204
- Come on!
- Shit.

1195
01:27:15,347 --> 01:27:16,925
Bogomil was here.

1196
01:27:31,864 --> 01:27:34,727
- Hey! You like rap music?
- Yeah.

1197
01:27:34,831 --> 01:27:39,276
I'm from the Rap Coalition of
America. Throw that gun over there.

1198
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:42,318
If you like rap music,
why ain't you smiling?

1199
01:27:42,422 --> 01:27:45,407
- I'm smiling.
- Smile. Let's rap together.

1200
01:27:45,512 --> 01:27:48,782
<i>~ Yo, baby, yo, baby, yo</i>
<i>Yo, baby, yo, baby, yo ~</i>

1201
01:27:48,886 --> 01:27:51,835
<i>~ Say ow!</i>
<i>Ow! ~</i>

1202
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:02,590
Those look like oil pumps to you?

1203
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:05,177
It looks like World War III.

1204
01:28:11,403 --> 01:28:13,057
- Here, Billy.
- What?

1205
01:28:13,161 --> 01:28:15,527
You don't have one of these, do you?

1206
01:28:19,828 --> 01:28:23,485
You guys hang around the back,
I'll check out the front.

1207
01:28:23,589 --> 01:28:24,632
Yeah!

1208
01:28:44,686 --> 01:28:47,633
- What are you doing?
- Element of surprise.

1209
01:28:47,737 --> 01:28:50,898
What? What, are you nuts?

1210
01:28:56,532 --> 01:28:59,689
Fool the connecting wire...

1211
01:28:59,793 --> 01:29:02,074
into thinking it's still intact.

1212
01:29:03,330 --> 01:29:08,490
These documents will make your life
much easier. You need to sign them.

1213
01:29:10,629 --> 01:29:12,782
- You still got that thing?
- Shh!

1214
01:29:12,886 --> 01:29:17,876
It's a bad idea. Of all the ideas
you've had, this is the worst.

1215
01:29:29,606 --> 01:29:32,856
- Sure you know what you're doing?
- Trust me.

1216
01:29:49,084 --> 01:29:50,247
Come on, Axel!

1217
01:29:57,509 --> 01:29:59,178
Get him!

1218
01:30:01,597 --> 01:30:03,221
Get your head down!

1219
01:30:08,478 --> 01:30:10,352
From behind!

1220
01:30:22,409 --> 01:30:24,698
"Pull pin."

1221
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:28,785
- Billy, what are you doing?
- "Extend."

1222
01:30:30,834 --> 01:30:33,198
- "Pull open and..." Wow!
- Billy!

1223
01:30:33,302 --> 01:30:34,754
"Release safety."

1224
01:30:36,465 --> 01:30:37,716
Billy!

1225
01:30:39,176 --> 01:30:41,215
Aim through there, push this.

1226
01:30:53,482 --> 01:30:55,106
Fuck Rambo.

1227
01:30:56,652 --> 01:30:58,940
Get me fucking out of here.

1228
01:31:06,495 --> 01:31:07,943
Cover me.

1229
01:31:08,047 --> 01:31:09,449
Go, Axel!

1230
01:31:41,113 --> 01:31:42,655
Watch it! OK!

1231
01:31:47,035 --> 01:31:49,316
C'mon, let's get the hell
out of here!

1232
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:50,824
Hold it!

1233
01:31:53,959 --> 01:31:56,445
Stay right there!

1234
01:31:56,549 --> 01:31:57,743
Freeze!

1235
01:32:01,717 --> 01:32:04,172
All right!
Lay your weapons down!

1236
01:32:17,065 --> 01:32:18,942
Mr Foley.

1237
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:30,070
You involved yourself in business
that doesn't concern you.

1238
01:32:33,207 --> 01:32:34,665
That was a mistake.

1239
01:33:38,146 --> 01:33:39,806
Goodbye, Mr Foley.

1240
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:51,357
Women.

1241
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:55,364
Come on, let's go.

1242
01:34:04,464 --> 01:34:06,995
Police! You're under arrest!

1243
01:34:07,099 --> 01:34:09,329
I think they know that, Billy.

1244
01:34:09,433 --> 01:34:12,585
Drop your weapons!
Put your hands on your heads!

1245
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:14,335
They got their hands up.

1246
01:34:14,439 --> 01:34:17,006
What took you guys so long?

1247
01:34:19,771 --> 01:34:21,636
Shit. We're in trouble now.

1248
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:26,100
Axel's AWOL. We can get out
of this if we keep quiet.

1249
01:34:26,204 --> 01:34:27,432
Don't say anything.

1250
01:34:27,537 --> 01:34:30,476
What the hell have you done here?

1251
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:34,858
Looks like a goddamn war zone.
What have you done, Taggart?

1252
01:34:34,963 --> 01:34:36,901
We solved the Alphabet crimes.

1253
01:34:37,005 --> 01:34:39,528
Shut up.
Who the hell is talking to you?

1254
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:43,199
I solved the Alphabet case
in a body bag over an hour ago.

1255
01:34:43,303 --> 01:34:49,205
And you. I don't give a damn who
you're working for. You're in jail.

1256
01:34:49,309 --> 01:34:50,955
- Chief...
- Shut up.

1257
01:34:51,059 --> 01:34:54,210
What are you doing,
bringing a fire fight to my city?

1258
01:34:54,314 --> 01:34:58,462
- You're out of the cop business!
- Will you just listen a minute?

1259
01:34:58,566 --> 01:35:01,923
- You shut your mouth!
- No, God damn it! You shut up!

1260
01:35:02,027 --> 01:35:06,594
This is what the Alphabet crimes
are about... guns! That guy sold them,

1261
01:35:06,699 --> 01:35:11,349
then bought them with stolen money
from Adriano's at his own racetrack.

1262
01:35:11,453 --> 01:35:13,479
He was going to Central America.

1263
01:35:13,584 --> 01:35:16,189
If you'd take your head
out of your ass,

1264
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:18,689
you'd see we solved the whole thing!

1265
01:35:18,793 --> 01:35:21,530
Lutz, why didn't I know about this?

1266
01:35:21,634 --> 01:35:24,822
Chief Lutz doesn't have
the guts to hear the truth.

1267
01:35:24,926 --> 01:35:28,411
We had to go undercover
with Foley to solve this case.

1268
01:35:28,515 --> 01:35:30,077
You're fired, Taggart!

1269
01:35:30,181 --> 01:35:34,376
- Yeah? Kiss my ass!
- Kiss mine! You're fired, too!

1270
01:35:34,481 --> 01:35:38,295
Lutz, I've had it
with your abusive attitude.

1271
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:40,378
I'm sorry. I get carried away.

1272
01:35:40,482 --> 01:35:44,423
- You're fired. Do you understand?
- Don't overreact, Ted.

1273
01:35:44,527 --> 01:35:46,970
I want you out of here now.

1274
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:49,347
Get out of here! Fired!

1275
01:35:49,452 --> 01:35:53,307
- You'll regret this, Ted.
- I've regretted it for two months.

1276
01:35:53,411 --> 01:35:56,398
You too. You're out of here.
Will you get out?

1277
01:35:56,503 --> 01:35:58,358
- Are they civilians?
- You bet.

1278
01:35:58,462 --> 01:36:00,856
I'll kick your ass later!

1279
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,276
Axel, thank you so much, really.

1280
01:36:03,380 --> 01:36:06,783
I've got a charity meeting
for the homeless for Beverly Hills.

1281
01:36:06,887 --> 01:36:11,163
I'd like to make a donation.
Here's $200 from Sidney Bernstein.

1282
01:36:11,267 --> 01:36:13,917
That's my alias.
I don't like publicity.

1283
01:36:14,021 --> 01:36:17,124
Thank you, Axel...
I mean, Sidney Bernstein.

1284
01:36:17,228 --> 01:36:20,057
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Thank you, sir.

1285
01:36:21,977 --> 01:36:24,546
"If you get your head
out of your ass"?

1286
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:26,594
"Kiss my ass"?

1287
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:29,221
You're getting more
like me every day.

1288
01:36:29,325 --> 01:36:33,446
Next thing you know, you'll have
afros... big dicks and all.

1289
01:36:39,286 --> 01:36:40,329
Axel.

1290
01:36:40,579 --> 01:36:43,148
- You make Chief of Police yet?
- Right.

1291
01:36:43,252 --> 01:36:44,863
You are the new chief?

1292
01:36:44,968 --> 01:36:47,866
Inspector Todd?
Ted Egan, mayor of Beverly Hills.

1293
01:36:47,971 --> 01:36:49,660
As I told your mayor,

1294
01:36:49,764 --> 01:36:54,039
we're very thankful you allowed Foley
to help us with this case.

1295
01:36:54,144 --> 01:36:56,959
According to him,
he's acquired all his skills

1296
01:36:57,063 --> 01:36:58,874
under your expert tutelage.

1297
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:01,012
Certainly. He's just arrived.

1298
01:37:03,894 --> 01:37:04,937
Hi!

1299
01:37:05,145 --> 01:37:08,220
Expert tutelage?
What the fuck have you been saying?

1300
01:37:08,324 --> 01:37:09,930
Let me talk to him.

1301
01:37:10,034 --> 01:37:12,805
Now that you're done
being a California hero,

1302
01:37:12,909 --> 01:37:14,889
get your ass home to your real job.

1303
01:37:14,994 --> 01:37:18,102
Yeah, I'm leaving now.
My ass left already.

1304
01:37:18,206 --> 01:37:19,815
I got to catch up with it.

1305
01:37:19,919 --> 01:37:21,774
Oh, yes, one other thing,

1306
01:37:21,879 --> 01:37:25,067
your secret partner
Mario Andretti Friedman

1307
01:37:25,171 --> 01:37:27,402
wrecked the goddamn Ferrari.

1308
01:37:27,506 --> 01:37:29,238
Here, you talk to Jeffrey.

1309
01:37:29,342 --> 01:37:33,659
Axel, it wasn't my fault.
There was a bus coming...

1310
01:37:33,763 --> 01:37:36,877
Hello? He hung up. Hello?

1311
01:37:39,555 --> 01:37:41,835
Axel, you don't have to go home now.

1312
01:37:41,939 --> 01:37:45,462
Let's go down to Mexico
and catch another marlin.

1313
01:37:45,566 --> 01:37:47,047
Fishing's too tiring.

1314
01:37:47,152 --> 01:37:50,425
It's back to Detroit for some
old-fashioned street violence.

1315
01:37:50,529 --> 01:37:56,018
Come with me. Your wife left you.
Come hang out. I know a lot of girls.

1316
01:37:56,122 --> 01:37:59,520
- Maureen came back.
- Did she? Congratulations.

1317
01:37:59,625 --> 01:38:02,563
The people you least expected,
they're studs.

1318
01:38:02,667 --> 01:38:05,358
The man's a stud
and we ain't even know it.

1319
01:38:05,463 --> 01:38:09,823
- She couldn't live without you?
- Her mother didn't have cable TV.

1320
01:38:09,928 --> 01:38:13,583
It wasn't no mother's cable TV.
Your cable brought her back.

1321
01:38:15,132 --> 01:38:16,325
I'm off.

1322
01:38:16,429 --> 01:38:18,705
Thanks a lot, Axel.

1323
01:38:18,809 --> 01:38:20,795
Don't thank me. I love you guys.

1324
01:38:23,348 --> 01:38:26,506
- See you around.
- Be cool, man.

1325
01:38:26,610 --> 01:38:29,049
Anything we can do for you?

1326
01:38:29,153 --> 01:38:32,720
Yeah. Take care of my uncle's house
till he gets back.

1327
01:38:32,825 --> 01:38:36,429
Axel, that's not really
your uncle's house, is it?

1328
01:38:36,533 --> 01:38:38,735
Oh, yeah. Trust me.

1329
01:38:41,492 --> 01:38:45,441
What the hell's going on?
Who are you? Who's that black guy?

1330
01:38:46,705 --> 01:38:48,359
