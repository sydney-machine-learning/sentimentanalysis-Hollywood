1
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,490
He looks great.

2
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,530
That Al Conti is a genius.

3
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,870
I am a genius!

4
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,630
So, how come you can't
keep track of your receipts?

5
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,630
How am I supposed to do your income
tax with this mess you've got here?

6
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,140
Numbers, taxes, receipts...

7
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,760
I make 'em look better than
they did in real life.

8
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,180
I'm an artistic genius.

9
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,100
Then, how come
you've got butter on your tie?

10
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:28,650
Give it here!

11
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,280
You know what? I give you this.
You make good coffee.

12
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,320
You're a slob, but you make good coffee.

13
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,870
Ah, red roses.

14
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,910
Very romantic, huh?

15
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,000
Ah, the guy that sends these
really knows what he's doing.

16
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,630
The guy who sends those
spends a lot of money

17
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
on something that ends up as garbage.

18
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,470
I'm glad everybody ain't like you, Loretta.

19
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,590
I'd be out of business.

20
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,760
What are you talking? I love flowers.

21
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,980
Thanks, Carmine.

22
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,830
Are you ready?

23
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:21,990
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?

24
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
Very good, Mr Johnny.

25
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,830
We will both have the Ticino salad.

26
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,500
And I'll have special fish.

27
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,880
No, it's oily fish tonight.
Not before the plane ride.

28
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,050
Maybe you're right.

29
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,930
<i>OK, we'll have the manicotti, Bobo.</i>

30
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,300
That'll give you a base for your stomach.

31
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:42,470
You eat oily fish,
you go up in the air,

32
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,310
halfway to Sicily,
you'll be green and sweating.

33
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,060
You look after me.

34
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,490
You'll ruin the evening...
Patricia, please, don't leave.

35
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,660
Do you think I'm a talking doll?!

36
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:04,830
I was just making a point about
the way you stated your aspirations...

37
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,120
You can kiss my aspirations, Professor!

38
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,210
Kiss my aspirations? Very clever.

39
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,380
The height of cleverness!

40
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,670
Waiter.

41
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,840
Yes?

42
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,260
Would you do away
with any evidence of her

43
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,430
and bring me a big glass of vodka?

44
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,600
But absolutely.

45
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,860
A man who can't control his woman...
is funny.

46
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,780
She was too young for him.

47
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,700
What's up, Uncle Bobo?

48
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:43,240
Tonight Mr Johnny's
gonna propose marriage.

49
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,660
- How do you know?
- He arranged it with me.

50
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,830
When he asks, he's gonna wave,

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,420
and then I serve the champagne.

52
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,420
A good bachelor customer for 20 years.

53
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,930
<i>Mille grazie.</i>

54
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,810
- How's things, hey?
- Fine, Bobo. We'll have the check.

55
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,350
No, no. I...

56
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,820
I wanna see the dessert cart.

57
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,360
Very good.

58
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,200
- You never have dessert.
- Never is a long time.

59
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
What's the matter with you?

60
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,220
My scalp is not getting
enough blood sometimes.

61
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,720
- Have some dessert.
- No, I shouldn't.

62
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:46,350
- Will you marry me?
- What?

63
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,430
Will you marry me?

64
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,020
Bobo, take the cart away.

65
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,190
Very good, Miss Loretta.

66
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,190
- Are you proposing marriage to me?
- Yes.

67
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,820
All right. You know I was married
and that my husband died.

68
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:06,200
What you don't know is
I think he and I had bad luck.

69
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,160
- What do you mean?
- We got married at the City Hall.

70
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:12,500
- It gave bad luck the whole marriage.
- I don't understand.

71
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,380
Right from the start, we didn't do it right.
Could you kneel down?

72
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,840
- On the floor?
- Yeah, on the floor.

73
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,930
- This is a good suit!
- I know!

74
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,760
I helped you pick it out.
It had two pairs of pants!

75
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:30,520
It's for luck. A man proposes marriage
to a woman, he should kneel down.

76
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,740
She's got him on his knees!
He's ruining his suit.

77
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,250
Is that man praying?

78
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,210
- So...
- Where's the ring?

79
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,090
- The ring!
- A ring, that's right.

80
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,300
<i>I would have sprung for the ring
if it was me, capisce?</i>

81
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,810
- You could use your pinky ring.
- I like this ring!

82
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:13,850
You propose marriage to a woman, you
should offer her a ring of engagement.

83
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,570
Loretta...

84
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,990
Loretta Castorini Clark,

85
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,410
on my knees,
in front of all of these people,

86
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:36,920
will you marry me?

87
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes, Johnny.

88
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:43,380
Yes, John Anthony Cammareri,
I will marry you. I will be your wife.

89
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,980
<i>Salute, paesano!</i>

90
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,860
Bobo!

91
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,860
- The check!
- Right away, Mr Johnny.

92
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
What about the wedding?

93
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,760
My mother is dying.

94
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,260
When she's dead,
I'll come back and we'll get married.

95
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,430
How near death is she?

96
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,100
A week.

97
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,350
Two weeks... No more.

98
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,310
How about we set a date? A month?

99
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,900
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say
we'll be married when I get back?

100
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,570
Where? The City Hall? No.

101
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,740
My mother is dying.

102
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,360
I want a whole wedding,
or we'll have bad luck.

103
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,410
For a whole wedding to be planned,
you gotta set a date.

104
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,700
All right, all right. A month.

105
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,910
- A month from today.
- In a month.

106
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,370
- A month from today.
- Yes, from today.

107
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,210
- OK, OK.
- From today, right.

108
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,670
I'll take care of the whole thing.
All you gotta do is show up.

109
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:15,930
<i>Departure for Paris,
please proceed to gate No.29.</i>

110
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,730
<i>Come on, andiamo.</i>

111
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:22,650
- Call me when you get in.
- I'll call from Mamma's.

112
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,820
OK. You made me very happy.

113
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,110
There's one thing about this wedding
I want you to do.

114
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
I want you to call...

115
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,070
Call this number. It's a business number.
You ask for Ronny.

116
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,790
- Invite him to the wedding.
- Who is it?

117
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:40,830
- It's my younger brother.
- You've got a brother?

118
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,210
We haven't spoken in five years.

119
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,710
There was some bad blood.

120
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,050
I want you to invite him to the wedding.

121
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,420
- Will you do it?
- Sure.

122
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:55,640
<i>Flight 604 for Rome with connections
to Palermo is now boarding at gate 43.</i>

123
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,640
I gotta go.

124
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:00,020
Have you got your ticket?

125
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:06,360
OK. Here, I got you these.
Gum and cough drops.

126
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,690
Gum opens your ears when you chew.

127
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,860
I gotta go.

128
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,790
<i>This is the last call
for flight No.604 for Rome...</i>

129
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,260
You have someone on that plane?

130
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,220
Yeah. My fiancé.

131
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:39,180
I put a curse on that plane.
My sister is on that plane.

132
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:44,690
I put a curse on that plane that it's going
to explode, burn and fall into the sea.

133
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,110
50 years ago, she stole a man from me.

134
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,280
<i>Si ha preso il mio uomo!</i>

135
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,030
Today she tells me
that she never loved him,

136
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,990
that she took him to be strong on me.

137
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,330
Now she's going back to Sicily.

138
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,500
<i>Si torna in Sicilia.</i>

139
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,040
I cursed her that the green Atlantic water
should swallow her up!

140
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,210
I don't believe in curses.

141
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,380
Neither do I.

142
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
- Mr Johnny's, right?
- Yeah.

143
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,040
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

144
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,210
The key's in it.

145
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:58,890
What do you mean?!
I've seen the way you look at her

146
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,720
- and it isn't right!
- How do I look at her?

147
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,810
- Can I help you?
- A split of Mumm.

148
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:06,520
- So, how do I look at her?
- Like a wolf!

149
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:11,610
- Like a wolf, huh?
- Like a wolf.

150
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,030
You've never seen a wolf in your life.

151
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:16,200
That's $11.99.

152
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,240
I've seen the wolf in everybody I ever met

153
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,620
and I see a wolf in you.

154
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,290
- That makes $20. Have a nice night.
- You, too.

155
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,920
- You know what I see in you?
- What?

156
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:33,090
The girl I married.

157
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,550
Oh, come on!

158
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,970
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

159
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,470
Goodnight.

160
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,760
Hi, guys! Oh, sweethearts!

161
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,550
How are you, how are you?
Guess what happened to me today.

162
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,930
<i>Ciao, bello.</i>

163
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,310
<i>Ciao, cara, ciao. Buonanotte.</i>

164
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,270
<i>Hey! Venite qua!</i>

165
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,110
Hey! How long must I wait?

166
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,150
Come here!

167
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,240
<i>Che cani sono questi?</i>

168
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,160
<i>Tutti a casa.</i>

169
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,240
- Hi, Pop.
- Oh, hi.

170
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,410
- Where's Ma?
- In bed.

171
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,620
- You're not sleeping?
- I can't sleep any more.

172
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,790
It's too much like death.

173
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,090
Pop, I've got news.

174
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,670
All right.

175
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Let's go into the kitchen.

176
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,880
<i>Ti amo.</i>

177
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,970
<i>Ti amo.</i>

178
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,350
You look tired, Pop.

179
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,690
So what's your news?

180
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,940
I'm getting married.

181
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,030
- Again?
- Yeah.

182
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:04,240
You did it before and it didn't work out.

183
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:06,410
- The guy died.
- What killed him?

184
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,160
- He got hit by a bus.
- No. Bad luck.

185
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,330
You mother and I were married 52 years.
Nobody died.

186
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,670
You were married two years,
somebody's dead. Don't get married again.

187
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:19,130
- Who's the man?
- Johnny Cammareri.

188
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,960
Jo!

189
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,550
Johnny Cammareri. He's a big baby.

190
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,100
- Why isn't he here telling me this?
- He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.

191
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,010
More bad luck.
I don't like his face, Loretta.

192
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,520
When he smiles, I can't see his teeth.
What does he hide?

193
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,100
- When are you gonna do it?
- In a month.

194
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,560
- I won't come.
- You've gotta give me away.

195
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,650
- I didn't give you away the first time.
- And I had bad luck!

196
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:46,320
Maybe, if you gave me away and I got
married in a church in a wedding dress,

197
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,990
instead of at the City Hall
with strangers at the door,

198
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,580
maybe I wouldn't have
had the bad luck I had.

199
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,460
Maybe.

200
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,080
Pop, I had no reception,
no wedding cake, no nothing.

201
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,380
Johnny got down on his knees
and proposed to me at the Grand Ticino.

202
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,470
- He did?
- Yes.

203
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,220
- That don't sound like Johnny.
- Well...

204
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,680
- Where's the ring?
- Here.

205
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,350
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring.

206
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,810
- It's a man's ring!
- It's temporary!

207
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,770
Everything is temporary!
That excuses nothing.

208
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,690
You're coming?

209
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,280
Let's go tell your mother.

210
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,950
Rose.

211
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,300
Who's dead?

212
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,380
Nobody.

213
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,760
- Loretta's getting married.
- Again?

214
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,140
Yeah.

215
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,430
- Johnny Cammareri.
- I don't like him.

216
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,060
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo.

217
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:57,230
- Do you love him, Loretta?
- No.

218
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,730
Good. When you love 'em, they drive
you crazy cos they know they can.

219
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,940
- But you like him?
- Oh, yeah.

220
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,110
He's a sweet man, Ma.

221
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:09,910
This time I'm gonna get married
in a church and have a big reception.

222
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,070
- And who's gonna pay for that?
- Pop.

223
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,160
- What?
- The father of the bride pays.

224
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,330
I have no money.

225
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,920
You're rich as Roosevelt.
You're just cheap.

226
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,540
I won't pay!

227
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,090
It's a father's duty
to pay for the wedding.

228
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,260
I won't pay for nothing.

229
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,340
He didn't used to be cheap.

230
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:31,390
He thinks if he holds onto his money,
he will never die.

231
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,140
Now he's gonna play
that damn Vicki Carr record

232
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:41,060
and when he comes to bed,
he won't touch me.

233
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,490
<i>Dai! Piano, piano!</i>

234
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,700
<i>Ecco, piano.</i>

235
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,840
Hey! Keep your dogs off my lawn!

236
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,100
Come on.

237
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,900
Don't do that!

238
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,570
She's asleep. Look at all the flowers.

239
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:31,070
My brother sent her a blue flower.

240
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,330
I can only see things in my house.
And things in my house are very bad.

241
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,540
I don't know what to advise my son.

242
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,370
I think he should pay for the wedding.

243
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:45,670
But it's important
that he don't look ridiculous.

244
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:48,550
- Why don't you talk to him?
- I will.

245
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,760
I must find the right moment.

246
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,130
<i>- Did you see la bella luna last night?
- Ah, si.</i>

247
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,350
<i>Ah, si, la luna. La bella luna.</i>

248
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:03,690
<i>The moon uh...
brings the woman to the man, capisci?</i>

249
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,520
<i>La luna attira I'uomo...
la donna verso I'uomo.</i>

250
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,820
<i>Avete capito?</i>

251
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,990
<i>Non avete capito niente.</i>

252
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,530
<i>Andiamo.</i>

253
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,200
<i>Vieni, vieni.</i>

254
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,950
<i>Non tirare. Non tirare. Non tirare!</i>

255
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,050
<i>Andiamo! Andiamo a casa.</i>

256
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,760
<i>Ciao.</i>

257
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,060
<i>Disgraziato!</i>

258
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,620
<i>Andiamo, andiamo, eh?</i>

259
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,620
<i>Come va?</i>

260
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,790
<i>Bene, bene. Upstairs.</i>

261
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:04,960
Everybody upstairs!

262
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,210
<i>Lo so. Va bene, va bene!</i>

263
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,630
<i>Come on! Andiamo! Insieme.</i>

264
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,670
<i>Tutti! Andiamo a casa.</i>

265
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,800
<i>Ciao, bello.</i>

266
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,180
<i>Ciao, cara. Ciao.</i>

267
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,860
- So, will you live here?
- No.

268
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,910
Why not?

269
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,080
Pop don't like Johnny.

270
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,870
- We can sell the house.
- I got married before, you didn't sell.

271
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,080
Grandma was still alive.
Ciro was still home, going to school.

272
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,750
Now he's married, gone to Florida.

273
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,840
If you and Johnny moved in
and had a baby...

274
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,430
Ma, I'm 37 years old.

275
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,640
What's 37?
I didn't have Ciro until after I was 37.

276
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:06,020
It ain't over till it's over.

277
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,190
Johnny's got a big apartment.
We'll move in there.

278
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,360
So we'll sell the house.

279
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,320
You know... What?

280
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,280
I wanna live here, I love the house.
Pop don't like Johnny.

281
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,450
No, we don't.

282
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,080
I'll get it.

283
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,250
OK.

284
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,500
<i>- Hello?
- Una chiamata per signorina Loretta...</i>

285
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,510
Yeah, yeah! This is Loretta Castorini.

286
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,050
<i>Si può parlare, signore.</i>

287
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,010
- Johnny!
- Johnny?

288
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,050
<i>Operator?</i>

289
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,470
<i>- Op... Loretta?
- Yeah!</i>

290
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,350
Yes. Sh sh sh! It's me.

291
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,150
I'm calling from the deathbed
of my mother.

292
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,360
Yeah. How was your plane ride?

293
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,740
The waitresses were very nice.

294
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,740
- My mother is slipping away.
- How long do I have to wait?

295
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,330
<i>Quanto io devo aspettare?</i>

296
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,700
<i>Stai ferma, stai ferma, mammita!</i>

297
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,880
I can't talk long.

298
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,500
Did you tell her we're getting married?

299
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:17,670
Oh, no, no. Not yet.

300
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,130
I'm waiting... I'm waiting
till a moment when she's peaceful.

301
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,340
Well, don't wait till she's dead.

302
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:27,640
- Have you called my brother?
- No. I'm sorry, no, not yet. I forgot.

303
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,730
<i>- Will you do it today?
- Yes. Yes.</i>

304
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:33,310
Make sure he comes to the wedding.

305
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,980
Five years is too long
for bad blood between brothers.

306
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:40,190
Nothing can replace the family, Loretta.

307
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,070
I can see that now...

308
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,990
<i>Loretta? Loretta, are you there?</i>

309
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,580
<i>- Loretta!
- OK, I'm sorry. I'll do it today.</i>

310
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,750
And listen, Johnny, you know,

311
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,960
<i>call me after you tell her, OK?</i>

312
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,630
All right, all right.

313
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:58,630
And

314
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,590
Don't stand directly under the sun.
Use your hat.

315
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,180
I got my hat, all right, all right.

316
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,470
Bye.

317
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,100
All right, bye-bye.

318
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,060
What did I do with that card?

319
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,890
How's the mother?

320
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,810
She's dying.
But I could still hear her big mouth.

321
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,590
He didn't tell her!

322
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,170
You know, the woman makes him crazy.

323
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:48,180
<i>Now who are you calling? Uffa!</i>

324
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,270
Cammareri's.

325
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,480
Yeah, is Ronny Cammareri there, please?

326
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,900
Hold on.

327
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,020
Ronny! The phone!

328
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,440
<i>Ronny!</i>

329
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,820
Yeah, this is Ronny.

330
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:07,280
Yeah. I'm calling for your brother.

331
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,530
He's getting married
and would like it if you would come.

332
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,700
<i>Why didn't he call himself?</i>

333
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,040
<i>- He's in Palermo.
- What's wrong can never be made right.</i>

334
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:18,080
Let me just come and talk...

335
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,750
talk to you!

336
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,090
Animal! What an animal!

337
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,320
Thanks, Mrs Fugacci.

338
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,280
There you go.

339
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:51,240
- Bye, see you tomorrow.
- Bye.

340
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,250
- Is Ronny Cammareri here?
- He's down at the ovens.

341
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,080
- What do you want?
- I wanna talk to him.

342
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:10,550
This way.

343
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,140
- Ronny!
- What?

344
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,060
- Somebody here to see Ronny.
- Ronny!

345
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,520
Ronny! Somebody wants to see you!

346
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,670
Have you come from my brother Johnny?

347
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,880
Yeah.

348
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,380
Why?

349
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:51,930
Well, we're gonna get married.

350
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,890
- You're gonna marry my brother Johnny.
- Yeah.

351
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,520
- Shall we go someplace to talk?
- I have no life.

352
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:03,270
Excuse me?

353
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,440
I have no life.

354
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:08,360
My brother Johnny took my life from me.

355
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,530
I... I don't understand you.

356
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,820
And now he's getting married.

357
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,200
He has his!

358
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,120
He's getting his.

359
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:21,870
And he wants me to come.

360
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,590
What is life?

361
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,380
- I didn't come here to upset you.
- They say bread is life.

362
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:33,220
And I bake bread... bread... bread!

363
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,720
And I sweat...
and shovel this stinking dough

364
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:39,350
in and out of this hot hole in the wall

365
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,810
and I should be so happy!

366
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,230
Huh, sweetie?

367
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,900
You want me to come
to the wedding of my brother?

368
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,860
Where's my wedding?

369
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,950
Chrissy! Over by the wall!

370
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,950
Bring me the big knife.

371
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,410
- No, Ronny!
- Bring me the big knife!

372
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,160
I'm gonna cut my throat!

373
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,750
Maybe I should come back another time.

374
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,540
No, I want you to see this.

375
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:09,000
You can watch me kill myself
so you can tell my brother Johnny

376
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,840
on his wedding day. OK?

377
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,970
Chrissy! Bring me the big knife!

378
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,680
I tell ya, I won't do it!

379
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,510
She won't do it. Do you know about me?

380
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,430
- Oh, Mr Cammareri...
- What?!

381
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:24,060
Do you know about me?

382
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,770
OK.

383
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,940
Nothing is anybody's fault.

384
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,490
But... things happen.

385
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,530
Look.

386
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,830
This wood is fake.

387
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,580
Five years ago,
I was engaged to be married. And

388
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,750
And Johnny came in here.

389
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,090
And he ordered bread from me.
And I said, "OK, some bread."

390
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,920
And I... I put my hand in the slicer

391
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,800
and it got caught
cos I wasn't paying attention.

392
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:58,510
The slicer chewed off my hand.

393
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,180
And it's funny, cos when
my fiancée found out about it...

394
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,350
When she found out I had been maimed,

395
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,520
she left me for another man.

396
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:10,270
That's the bad blood
between you and Johnny?

397
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,110
Yes, that's it.

398
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,450
Yeah, but that's not Johnny's fault.

399
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,240
I don't care!
I ain't no freakin' monument to justice!

400
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:22,200
I lost my hand!

401
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:24,290
I lost my bride!

402
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,830
Johnny has his hand!
Johnny has his bride!

403
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,790
You want me to take my heartbreak,
put it away and forget?!

404
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,810
Is it just a matter of time

405
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,730
before a man opens his eyes

406
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,730
and gives up his one

407
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,280
dream,

408
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:59,320
his one dream of happiness?

409
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,410
Maybe.

410
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,290
Maybe.

411
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,770
This is the most tormented man
I have known.

412
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,940
I'm in love with this man.

413
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:36,110
But he doesn't know that.

414
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,200
Cos I never told him

415
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:42,410
cos he could never love anybody
since he lost his hand and his girl.

416
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,960
Where do you live?

417
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,130
Upstairs.

418
00:30:56,630 --> 00:30:58,630
Can't we just talk?

419
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,200
What are we painting here?
The Sistine Chapel?

420
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,750
We should have been plumbers
like Castorini.

421
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:48,600
Well, Mr Castorini, what do you think?

422
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,820
$10,800.

423
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,360
That seems like a lot.

424
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,780
Look.

425
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:07,950
There are three kinds of pipe.

426
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,080
There's the kind of pipe you have,
which is garbage.

427
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,420
And you can see where that's gotten you.

428
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,130
Then there's bronze...
which is very good.

429
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:20,340
Unless something goes wrong.
And something always goes wrong.

430
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,090
And then

431
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,220
there's copper
which is the only pipe I use.

432
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:28,390
It costs money.

433
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,520
It costs money because it saves money.

434
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:38,730
I think we should follow
Mr Castorini's advice, heart.

435
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,710
And then

436
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,210
there's copper
which is the only pipe I use.

437
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,790
It costs money.

438
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:03,010
It costs money because it saves money.

439
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,180
And what did they say?

440
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:09,260
Well, the man understood me.

441
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,430
The woman wanted to be cheap.

442
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,480
But the man saw I was right.

443
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,810
You have such a head for knowing.

444
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,980
You know everything.

445
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,240
I've brought you something.

446
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,120
It's a present.

447
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,500
Oh, Cosmo!

448
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,460
Oh, my God!

449
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:45,420
They're little birds and stars.

450
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:52,470
Birds fly to the stars, I guess. Huh?

451
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,940
What's that smell?

452
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
- I'm making you a steak.
- I don't want it.

453
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,650
You'll eat it.

454
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,020
I like it well done.

455
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,280
You'll eat this one bloody
to feed your blood.

456
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:05,590
This is good.

457
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,760
Loretta.

458
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,930
- Where did Johnny find you?
- He knew my husband who died.

459
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:12,720
- How did he die?
- A bus hit him.

460
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,680
- Fast?
- Instantaneous.

461
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:18,180
- When did you get engaged?
- Yesterday.

462
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:23,440
So, five years ago, you got your hand
cut off and your woman left you.

463
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:25,190
- No woman since then?
- No.

464
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,480
Stupid.

465
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:31,320
When did your husband get hit by a bus?

466
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:33,280
Seven years ago.

467
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,910
- How many men since then?
- Just Johnny.

468
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,250
Stupid yourself.

469
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,540
No. Unlucky. I've not been lucky.

470
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,540
I don't care about luck.
You understand me?

471
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,540
It ain't that.

472
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,710
What's the matter with you?

473
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,590
You think you're the only one
who ever shed a tear?

474
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,430
Why are you talking to me?

475
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,270
You got any whiskey? How about
you give me a glass of whiskey?

476
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:21,870
I'll call you later.

477
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:44,810
Well...

478
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,650
She was right to leave me.

479
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:50,110
- You think so?
- Yeah.

480
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,150
You really are stupid, you know that?

481
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:56,700
You don't know nothing about it.

482
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,080
Look,

483
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,330
you know, I was raised
that a girl gets married young.

484
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,500
I held out for love.

485
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,670
I got married when I was 28.

486
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:10,340
I met a man, I loved him, I married him.

487
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:14,050
He wanted to have a baby right away.
I said we should wait.

488
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,220
Then he gets hit by a bus.

489
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,350
So what do I got?
I got no man, no baby, no nothing.

490
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:22,980
How did I know that
that man was a gift I couldn't keep?

491
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,140
My one chance of happiness.

492
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,310
You tell me the story
and act like you know what it means.

493
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,150
But I can see
what the true story is and you can't.

494
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,280
That woman didn't leave you.

495
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,950
You can't see what you are
and I see everything.

496
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,700
You're a wolf.

497
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,870
- I'm a wolf?
- Yeah.

498
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,460
The...
The big part of you has no words and

499
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,210
it's a wolf.

500
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,380
That woman was a trap for you.

501
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,750
You couldn't get away,
so you chewed off your own foot.

502
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,920
That was the price of your freedom.

503
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:58,340
Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did
what you had to do between you and you.

504
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:02,430
And now you're afraid because you
know the big part of you is a wolf

505
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,310
that has the courage to bite off its hand
to escape from the trap of the wrong love.

506
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,650
That's why there's been no woman
since that wrong woman. OK?

507
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:14,070
You're scared of what the wolf will do
if you slip up again.

508
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,490
- What are you doing?
- Telling you your life.

509
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,820
- Stop it.
- No.

510
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,070
Why are you marrying Johnny?
He's a fool.

511
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,410
Because I have no luck.

512
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:27,290
He made me look the wrong way
and I cut off my hand.

513
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,170
If you look the wrong way,
you could lose your head.

514
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:32,540
I'm looking where I have to to be a bride.

515
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,760
- A bride without a head.
- A wolf without a foot!

516
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,770
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

517
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,710
What are you doing?

518
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,290
Son of a bitch!

519
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,460
Where are you taking me?

520
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:14,500
To the bed.

521
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:17,340
Oh, God! OK, I don't care, I don't care.

522
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,470
Take me, take me to the bed.

523
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,640
I don't care about anything.

524
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,300
I don't believe this is happening.

525
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,100
- I was dead.
- Me, too.

526
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,860
- What about Johnny?
- You're mad at him.

527
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:39,070
Take your revenge out on me.

528
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:44,280
Leave nothing left for him to marry,
nothing but the skin over my bones.

529
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:47,410
All right, there will be nothing left.

530
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,600
- Let's eat while it's hot.
- Where's Loretta, huh?

531
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:10,810
- She must be eating out.
- She don't know what she's missing!

532
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,980
It's not like her not to call.

533
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:15,440
Well, she's got a lot on her mind.

534
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:18,110
We can talk about it, right?
Everybody knows.

535
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,320
I don't wanna talk about it.

536
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:26,370
Johnny Cammareri.
I think it's a great idea and about time.

537
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,370
What is she gonna do with the rest
of her life if she don't get married?

538
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,750
I don't wanna talk about it.

539
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,540
My father needs another plate.

540
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,840
Cosmo, many years ago,
when they told me

541
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:47,050
you were marrying my sister,

542
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,010
I was happy.

543
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,430
When I told Rose that I was marrying Rita,

544
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,480
she was happy.

545
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,060
Well, marriage is happy news, right?

546
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:01,150
Rose, pass the wine.

547
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,660
I never seen anybody so in love

548
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,830
like Cosmo was back then.

549
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:12,960
He'd stand outside the house all day
looking in the windows.

550
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,830
I never told you this,
cos it's not really a story.

551
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,840
But one time,
I woke up in the middle of the night

552
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,510
cos of this bright light in my face.

553
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:27,090
Like a flashlight.
I couldn't think of what it was.

554
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:29,930
I looked out the window

555
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,060
and it was the moon,

556
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,180
as big as a house.

557
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:37,730
I never seen the moon so big
before or since.

558
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:41,480
I was almost scared,
like it was gonna crush the house.

559
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:45,950
Then I looked down, and standing there
in the street was Cosmo

560
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,160
looking up at the windows.

561
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,040
This is the funny part!

562
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
I got mad at you, Cosmo.

563
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:57,080
I thought you had brought
that big moon over to my house,

564
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:59,290
because you were so in love

565
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:01,460
and woke me up with it.

566
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,630
I was half-asleep, I guess.

567
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,090
You were altogether asleep.
You were dreaming.

568
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:09,890
No.

569
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:12,010
You were there.

570
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,520
I don't wanna talk about it.

571
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,850
Well, what do you wanna talk about?

572
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,060
Why are you drinking so much?

573
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:24,650
Old man! You give those dogs
another piece of my food,

574
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,490
I'm gonna kick you till you're dead.

575
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,150
Cosmo.

576
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,860
Cosmo!

577
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,080
You drank too much.

578
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:20,080
Now you'll sleep too hard and later
you'll be up when you should be down.

579
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,050
What's the matter?

580
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,640
Nothing. I'm looking at the moon.

581
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,110
It's perfect.

582
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:28,070
I never seen a moon like that before.

583
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:32,030
It makes you look like an angel.

584
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,740
It looks like a

585
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:41,370
giant snowball.

586
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,960
- Rita.
- What?

587
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:47,710
- Rita, dear.
- What?

588
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,590
- Wake up!
- What?

589
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:54,130
Look.

590
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,930
Oh.

591
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,060
It's Cosmo's moon.

592
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:04,440
What are you talking about?
Cosmo can't own the moon.

593
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,730
It's that moon I was talking about

594
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:10,230
at dinner.

595
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,580
Is he down there?

596
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,540
Is who down there?

597
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,040
Cosmo.

598
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:30,090
- What would he be doing down there?
- I don't know.

599
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,760
You know something?

600
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:40,850
In that light,

601
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:44,350
with that expression on your face,

602
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,560
you look about 25 years old.

603
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,080
- Rita.
- What do you want?

604
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,840
Get out, get out!

605
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:16,970
- Rita...
- No!

606
00:46:31,110 --> 00:46:33,110
<i>Piano!</i>

607
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,740
<i>Ho detto di non tirare!</i>

608
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:41,910
<i>Piano.</i>

609
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:44,500
<i>Piano, piano, piano.</i>

610
00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:47,290
<i>Non tirare. Non tirare!</i>

611
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,130
<i>E guardate la luna.</i>

612
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,290
<i>Guardate la bella luna!</i>

613
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,510
<i>Guarda!</i>

614
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:57,800
<i>Ah, veramente una luna bella.</i>

615
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:01,970
<i>Ma guardate.
Ma non giù! Su! Guardate su!</i>

616
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,770
Why do you make me wait?

617
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,730
Come on, come on!

618
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,690
Howl, howl!

619
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:19,740
Hey, howl, come on!

620
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,660
<i>Guarda la luna!</i>

621
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:54,650
- Oh, my God!
- What?

622
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:56,820
- What?!
- Take it easy.

623
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,950
- This time I wanted to do it right.
- Don't become excited.

624
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:03,530
I thought if I didn't go to the City Hall,
I wouldn't have bad luck.

625
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,540
- You make me feel guilty.
- I'm marrying your brother!

626
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,620
All right, I'm guilty. I confess.

627
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:11,080
The wedding's in two weeks.
You're invited.

628
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:14,040
How come you didn't
be with your mother in Palermo?

629
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:16,210
She don't like me.

630
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,920
You don't get along with anybody,
do you?

631
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:21,130
- What did you do?
- What did I do?!

632
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:25,680
- You ruined my life.
- That's impossible.

633
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:28,720
It was ruined when I got here.
You ruined my life.

634
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:32,190
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, yes, you did.

635
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:34,360
Oh, yes, you did.

636
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,230
You've got them bad eyes, like a gypsy.
Why didn't I see it yesterday?

637
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,200
Bad luck, that's it.
Is that all I'm ever gonna have?

638
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,660
I should have taken a rock
and killed myself years ago.

639
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,830
I'm gonna marry him. Do you hear me?

640
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,830
Last night never happened.
I'm gonna marry him.

641
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,580
You and I are gonna take this
to our coffins.

642
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,750
- I can't do that?
- Why not?

643
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,960
I'm in love with you.

644
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,470
- Snap out of it!
- I can't.

645
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,640
Then I must never see you again

646
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:09,060
and the bad blood will have to stay
between you and Johnny.

647
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,600
- And you won't come to the wedding.
- I will.

648
00:49:11,770 --> 00:49:14,650
- I'm telling you, you can't!
- He wants me to come.

649
00:49:14,810 --> 00:49:16,810
That's because he don't know, OK?

650
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,030
Now wait a minute, honey.
Listen, all right.

651
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:22,950
I won't come to the wedding
provided one thing.

652
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:26,200
- What?
- Come with me tonight to the opera.

653
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:29,030
- What are you talking about?!
- I love two things.

654
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,370
I love you and... and I love the opera.

655
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:35,040
If I can have the two things I love
together for one night,

656
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,380
I would be satisfied to give up...

657
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,250
Oh, Christ, to give up the rest of my life.

658
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,670
- All right, all right.
- All right.

659
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,800
All right!

660
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:46,300
- Meet me at the Met.
- All right, all right.

661
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,430
- Where's the Met?
- Well, you gotta...

662
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:23,090
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
It's two months since my last confession.

663
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,260
What sins have you to confess?

664
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,510
Twice I took the Lord's name in vain,

665
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,930
once I slept with my fiancé's brother,

666
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,180
and I bounced a check
at the liquor store, but by mistake.

667
00:50:33,350 --> 00:50:35,350
Then it's not a sin.

668
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,520
But,

669
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:41,480
what was that second thing you said,
Loretta?

670
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:44,570
You mean the one about
I slept with my fiancé's brother?

671
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,900
That's a pretty big sin.

672
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:49,490
- I know.
- You should think about this.

673
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:50,660
I know.

674
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,410
All right.

675
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,450
For your penance, say two rosaries.

676
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,080
Be careful, Loretta.

677
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,960
Reflect on your life.

678
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:04,130
All right.

679
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:08,300
<i>Ego te absolvo, in nomine Patris,
Filii et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

680
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:10,010
Amen.

681
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:32,830
Hi.

682
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:35,790
- Where you been?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

683
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:37,960
Just like your father.

684
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:40,790
I lied to him.

685
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,460
He thinks you came home last night.

686
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:46,590
Thanks.

687
00:51:49,550 --> 00:51:51,550
What's the matter with you?

688
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,720
Cosmo's cheating on me.

689
00:51:53,890 --> 00:51:55,890
What? How do you know this?

690
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:58,060
A wife knows.

691
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:02,060
You don't even know.
You're just imagining it. He's too old.

692
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,520
I won't be home for dinner.

693
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,750
I feel great!

694
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:25,750
I got no sleep,
but I feel like Orlando Furioso.

695
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:27,920
You were a tiger last night.

696
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:33,840
And you were a lamb. As soft as... milk.

697
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:36,010
Ssh! They'll hear you in the back.

698
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:40,350
The pleasure of marriage is you sleep
with the woman and worry about nothing.

699
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,560
- Be quiet, Raymond!
- Hey! How about a date tonight?

700
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:46,980
- What's the matter with you?!
- We'll eat some pasta...

701
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:50,320
- What's got into you?
- I don't know. I really don't know.

702
00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:52,280
That moon...

703
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:54,870
That crazy moon Cosmo sent over.

704
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:57,280
Hi, Rita. Hi, Uncle Raymond.

705
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:58,910
Hey, there!

706
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:05,880
- What's the matter with him?
- You got me.

707
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:09,460
- Did you see that moon last night?
- What... what moon?

708
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:11,220
- Did you see it?
- No.

709
00:53:12,970 --> 00:53:15,680
I gotta go.
I'll take the deposit to the bank,

710
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,890
but I gotta do the books tomorrow.

711
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:20,060
Oh, sure. You got a date.

712
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,390
What are you talking about, you fool?

713
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:25,270
Her fiancé's in Palermo. What date?!

714
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,060
Oh. Right.

715
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:29,230
I just got a lot of things to do.

716
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:31,570
- All that wedding stuff, huh?
- Yeah.

717
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:35,240
Hey! That's romantic, too.

718
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,080
Hey, Frankie!

719
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,290
Make me a bowl of minestrone!

720
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:47,790
What's the matter with you?
You look crazy.

721
00:53:48,590 --> 00:53:51,090
- I got a lot on my mind.
- What?

722
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:53,380
- I got a lot on my mind...
- Don't say that.

723
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:56,760
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't wanna talk about it!

724
00:53:57,970 --> 00:53:59,970
I don't wanna talk about it.

725
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,790
Take out the grey.

726
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:26,040
I have wanted to do this for three years!
Let me show you some magazines.

727
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:29,380
And then you need a manicure, yes.

728
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:31,960
You take her, Bettina. Take out the grey.

729
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:35,840
<i>- Finalmente, che brutta!
- And someone has to do the eyebrows...</i>

730
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:38,010
Wait a minute, wait...

731
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:41,720
- Has anybody here been to the opera?
- Not me.

732
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,140
<i>Bellissima without those ugly greys.</i>

733
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,310
It's fantastic.

734
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,150
- Have you ever been to the opera?
- No. Have you?

735
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,740
Ow!

736
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,400
Bettina, you ever been to the opera?

737
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,990
- I never been.
- You going to the Met?

738
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,660
Yes.

739
00:55:03,830 --> 00:55:06,830
She turned 40 and her husband left her.

740
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:11,880
- Bye-bye.
- OK, OK, OK.

741
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,890
- Wow.
- Look at that.

742
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,080
Careful.

743
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,550
Hi, I'm home!

744
00:55:57,720 --> 00:56:00,470
Don't everybody answer at the same time.

745
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:02,640
Hello!

746
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,050
- Hi.
- Hi.

747
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:26,720
You look beautiful.

748
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:30,340
- Your hair.
- Yeah, I had it done.

749
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:34,520
- You look beautiful, too.
- Thank you.

750
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,600
No.

751
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:42,270
I said I'd go to the opera with you,
but... that's all.

752
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,740
Come on, let's go in.

753
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:08,340
- Oh, look at that.
- It's something, isn't it?

754
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:26,690
Wow! Thank you.

755
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,860
For what?

756
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:31,280
I don't know. For your hair.

757
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:33,450
For your beautiful dress.

758
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:38,910
I don't know. It's been a long time
since I've been to the opera.

759
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:43,540
So where are we sitting?

760
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,500
Come on.

761
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:45,810
Here we go.

762
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,040
- So. Who's coming?
- Just me. I want to eat.

763
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:07,000
OK. I got a table for you right now.

764
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:09,170
- This all right?
- Fine.

765
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,390
- Enjoy your meal, Mrs Castorini.
- Thanks.

766
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:20,220
Signora Castorini,
you dining alone tonight?

767
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:23,980
Hello, Bobo, yeah.
Let me have a martini, no ice, two olives.

768
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,100
Ah, very good.

769
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:32,940
When I tell you how I feel,
you tell me how you feel.

770
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:37,070
- That's not much of a response.
- It's the only response I've got.

771
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:40,410
- You want something to eat?
- Not now. I'll wave.

772
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:41,740
Very good.

773
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:45,040
I really hate it
when you use that tone with me.

774
01:02:45,210 --> 01:02:47,210
Like isn't it so amusing.

775
01:02:47,370 --> 01:02:49,420
- But it is.
- Not to me!

776
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:53,210
This is my life, no matter
how comical it may seem to you.

777
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:56,550
I don't need some man watching
while I roll around in the mud.

778
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:00,600
I think you like to roll around in the mud
and I don't. That's fair...

779
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,360
Sorry about that, folks.

780
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:16,780
She's a very pretty mental patient.

781
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:22,450
No, don't...
No, no, no. Please, don't mind me.

782
01:03:22,620 --> 01:03:24,750
Just do me a favour and clear her place.

783
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:28,120
Get rid of all evidence of her
and bring me a big glass of vodka.

784
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:30,080
Absolutely.

785
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:33,340
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.

786
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:36,340
I'm not disturbed by you.

787
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:40,180
My lady friend has a personality disorder.

788
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,180
She's just too young for you.

789
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:46,230
- Ah, thanks, comrade.
- It's nothing.

790
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:47,940
Too young?

791
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,310
I just got that.
You know how to hurt a guy.

792
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,360
- How old are you?
- None of your business.

793
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:56,150
I'm sorry. That was rude.

794
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:03,030
Would you like to join me for dinner?

795
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:06,450
Are you sure?

796
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,540
I'd be delighted.

797
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:14,500
I hate to eat alone. It's amazing
how often I end up doing just that.

798
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,850
Signora Castorini... your minestrone.

799
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:28,020
<i>- Thanks, Bobo.
- Prego.</i>

800
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,900
What do you do?

801
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:34,310
I'm a professor of communication at NYU.

802
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,570
- That woman was a student of yours?
- Sheila? Yeah, she was.

803
01:04:37,740 --> 01:04:39,530
Is.

804
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,570
Was.

805
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:45,080
There's an old saying
my mother taught me.

806
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,830
Don't shit where you eat.

807
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:50,870
OK, I'll remember that.

808
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:55,380
- What do you do?
- I'm a housewife.

809
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:59,470
- How come you're eating alone?
- I'm not eating alone.

810
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:05,050
- May I ask you a question?
- Yeah, go ahead.

811
01:05:06,390 --> 01:05:08,390
Why do men chase women?

812
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,310
Nerves.

813
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:18,650
I think it's because they fear death.

814
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:24,820
Well, maybe.
Do you wanna know why I chase women?

815
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:27,530
I find women charming.

816
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:31,160
I teach these classes
I've taught for a million years.

817
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:34,790
The spontaneity went out of it for me
a long time ago.

818
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,000
At first, I was excited about something,
I wanted to share it. Now it's rote.

819
01:05:39,170 --> 01:05:41,670
A multiplication table.

820
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,840
Except sometimes...

821
01:05:44,010 --> 01:05:46,600
Sometimes, I'll be droning along

822
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:50,470
and I'll look up and I'll see a fresh,

823
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,730
beautiful young face.

824
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:54,900
And it's all new to her.

825
01:05:55,060 --> 01:05:59,440
I'm just this great guy
who's brilliant and thinks out loud.

826
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:03,610
When that happens,
when I look out there among those chairs,

827
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:06,070
and see a young woman's face

828
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,240
and see me in her eyes,

829
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:11,290
me, the way I always wanted to be,
maybe once was,

830
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:13,660
I ask her out for a date.

831
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,960
It doesn't last long.

832
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:21,130
A few weeks,

833
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:23,510
a couple of precious months.

834
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:29,850
Then she catches on that
I'm just this burned-out old gasbag

835
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:32,350
and she's as fresh and bright

836
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,980
and full of promise
as moonlight in a martini.

837
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:47,030
And at that moment she stands up
and throws a glass of water in my face

838
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,870
or some action to that effect.

839
01:06:50,030 --> 01:06:53,000
What you don't know
about women is a lot.

840
01:06:55,830 --> 01:06:58,830
Well... that's not what I hear.

841
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:09,550
- Two white wines, please.
- Yes, sir.

842
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,900
I'd like two glasses of champagne.

843
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:27,780
Canadian Club with ginger ale
and Dubonnet on the rocks, please.

844
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:31,080
- What's that?
- This was done by Marc Chagall.

845
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:33,410
As you can see, he was a great artist.

846
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:36,710
- It's kinda gaudy.
- He was having some fun.

847
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:39,540
They get some turnout for this stuff, huh?

848
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:41,630
It's the best thing there is.

849
01:07:41,790 --> 01:07:46,470
You know, I like parts of it,
but I just don't... really get it.

850
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:51,390
You haven't once said you like my dress.

851
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:53,560
I like your dress.

852
01:07:54,850 --> 01:07:57,810
It's very bright. Oh...

853
01:08:07,070 --> 01:08:09,200
Will you hold this? Thanks.

854
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:11,910
May I walk with you a ways?

855
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:14,280
Sure. Thanks.

856
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:20,370
- Do you live far from here?
- Just up there.

857
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:31,650
- You knew that man?
- Yes.

858
01:11:20,010 --> 01:11:22,010
That was so awful.

859
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:25,640
- Awful?
- Beautiful! Sad.

860
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:27,810
- She died.
- Yes.

861
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:30,810
I couldn't believe it.
I didn't think she would die.

862
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:33,190
- I knew she was sick, but...
- She had TB.

863
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,820
I know! She was coughing her brains out.

864
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:38,160
And still she had to keep singing.

865
01:11:41,370 --> 01:11:42,330
Pop.

866
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:46,500
Pop, what are you doing here?

867
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:50,460
Wait for me by the doors, Mona.

868
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,840
- Mona?
- Excuse me!

869
01:11:58,680 --> 01:12:01,300
- What did you do to your hair?
- I... had it done.

870
01:12:02,220 --> 01:12:05,060
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

871
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,770
- Who's that? You're engaged.
- You're married.

872
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:10,310
<i>You're my daughter.
Don't act like a puttana.</i>

873
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:12,860
- And you're my father...
- All right.

874
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:15,690
I didn't see you here.

875
01:12:15,820 --> 01:12:18,110
I don't know if I saw you here or what.

876
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:31,130
Let's get outta here.
I'll buy you a drink.

877
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:33,500
That woman was not my mother, OK?

878
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:37,050
That's my house.

879
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:39,880
- You mean the whole house?
- Yes.

880
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,720
My God! It's a mansion.

881
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:44,890
It's a house.

882
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:47,220
I live in a one-bedroom apartment.

883
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:49,390
What exactly does your husband do?

884
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:51,350
He's a plumber.

885
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,810
Well, that explains it, then.

886
01:12:57,150 --> 01:12:59,650
Temperature's dropping.

887
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:03,410
- I guess you can't invite me in.
- No.

888
01:13:03,570 --> 01:13:04,950
People home.

889
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:07,910
No. I think the house is empty.

890
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,960
I can't invite you in because I'm married.

891
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,130
Because I know who I am.

892
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:18,380
- You're shivering.
- I'm a little cold.

893
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:22,050
You're a little boy. And you like to be bad.

894
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:26,220
We could go to my apartment.
See how the other half lives.

895
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:29,100
I'm too old for you.

896
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:32,600
I'm too old for me.
That's my predicament.

897
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,480
Goodnight.

898
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:39,940
Goodnight.
Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?

899
01:13:41,990 --> 01:13:43,990
Sure.

900
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:52,830
I'm freezing.

901
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,790
Goodnight.

902
01:13:55,380 --> 01:13:57,380
Goodnight.

903
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,960
Anything else, folks?

904
01:14:41,130 --> 01:14:42,920
- Loretta?
- No.

905
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:46,590
- I think that's it, Al.
- See you, Al!

906
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:56,400
- What do you wanna do now?
- I wanna go home.

907
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:05,360
- Goodnight, Al.
- Take it easy, Ronny.

908
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,240
God, it's cold.

909
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:13,410
It smells like snow.

910
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:16,830
You know, my mother guessed
my father was seeing somebody.

911
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,170
That Mona, I mean,
she's some piece of cheap goods.

912
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:22,710
Who am I to talk?

913
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:25,920
- What's the matter?
- How can you ask me that?

914
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:29,470
- You're making me feel guilty.
- You are guilty! I'm guilty.

915
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:32,810
Of what?
Only God can point the finger, Loretta.

916
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:36,230
- Yeah, well, I know what I know.
- And what do you know?

917
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:40,730
OK, you tell me my life.
I'll tell you yours.

918
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:45,690
I'm a wolf. You run to the wolf in me.
That don't make you no lamb.

919
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:47,860
You're gonna marry my brother.

920
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:52,330
Why do you wanna sell your life short?

921
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:57,250
Playing it safe's the most dangerous
thing a woman like you could do.

922
01:15:57,410 --> 01:16:00,460
I mean, you waited for
the right man the first time.

923
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:04,670
- Why didn't you wait for him again?
- Because he didn't come.

924
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:07,130
- I'm here.
- You're late.

925
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,770
This is your place.
So this is where we were going.

926
01:16:15,930 --> 01:16:17,100
Yeah.

927
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:19,270
You know, we had a deal.

928
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,730
You said if I came with you to the opera

929
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:24,900
you'd leave me alone for ever.
And I came with you!

930
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:29,950
I'm gonna marry your brother and you're
gonna leave me alone for ever, right?

931
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:34,030
A person can see
where they've messed up in their life.

932
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:38,250
They can change the way they do things.
They can even change their luck.

933
01:16:38,410 --> 01:16:42,420
So maybe my nature does draw me
to you. But I don't have to go with it.

934
01:16:42,580 --> 01:16:46,670
I can take hold of myself
and I can say yes to some things

935
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:50,050
and no to other things
that will ruin everything.

936
01:16:50,220 --> 01:16:52,970
Otherwise, you know, what...

937
01:16:53,930 --> 01:16:57,770
What good is this stupid life
that God gave us? I mean, for what?

938
01:16:57,930 --> 01:17:00,520
Are you listening to me?!

939
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:02,560
Yeah.

940
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:07,650
Everything seems like nothing to me now.
I want you in my bed.

941
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:10,280
I don't care if I burn in hell.

942
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:13,660
I don't care if you burn in hell.

943
01:17:13,820 --> 01:17:15,830
The past and the future is

944
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:18,000
a joke to me now.

945
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:21,120
I see that they're nothing,
I see they ain't here.

946
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:23,040
The only thing that's here

947
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:26,420
is you... and me.

948
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:28,590
- I wanna go home.
- No.

949
01:17:28,710 --> 01:17:29,970
- I'm gonna go home.
- No!

950
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:32,510
- I'm freezing to death.
- Come upstairs.

951
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:34,680
I don't care why you come.

952
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:37,390
No, that's not what I mean.

953
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:39,560
Loretta,

954
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:41,730
I love you.

955
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:44,730
Not... not like they told you love is.

956
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:48,820
I didn't know this either.
But love don't make things nice.

957
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:52,740
It ruins everything.
It breaks your heart.

958
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:56,910
It makes things a mess.
We aren't here to make things perfect.

959
01:17:57,990 --> 01:18:00,500
- The snowflakes are perfect...
- Oh!

960
01:18:03,250 --> 01:18:05,380
The stars are perfect.

961
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:07,880
Not us. Not us!

962
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:11,630
We are here to ruin ourselves

963
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:14,680
and... and to break our hearts

964
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:17,350
and love the wrong people.

965
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:19,310
And die!

966
01:18:19,470 --> 01:18:22,140
I mean that the storybooks are bullshit!

967
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:27,020
Now I want you to come upstairs with me

968
01:18:27,190 --> 01:18:29,190
and get in my bed!

969
01:18:37,450 --> 01:18:39,490
Come on.

970
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:46,210
Come on.

971
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:50,920
Come on.

972
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:00,030
19 Cranberry Street, Brooklyn.

973
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:03,240
Got it.

974
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,750
Hold it!

975
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:24,970
- How much?
- 25.

976
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:27,140
- 25 dollars?
- Yeah.

977
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:33,070
Hold it.

978
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,950
Hey!

979
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:59,300
Oh, hi. I'm sorry to call so late.

980
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:01,430
Moving in?

981
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:03,600
No, I came right from the airport.

982
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:05,760
Come on in.

983
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:15,020
Can you wake up Loretta?
I need to talk to her.

984
01:21:15,190 --> 01:21:19,570
She's not home yet. Take off your coat
and come through. I'll make you a drink.

985
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:22,450
I wanna talk to you!

986
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,500
Thank you. Where is she?

987
01:21:33,630 --> 01:21:35,670
Out. I don't know where.

988
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,880
So. What are you doing here?

989
01:21:39,050 --> 01:21:41,590
You're supposed to be in Palermo.

990
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:45,390
This is what I came to tell Loretta.
There's been a miracle.

991
01:21:45,550 --> 01:21:49,100
A miracle? Well, that's news.

992
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:53,150
My mother's recovered.

993
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:56,730
- You're kidding?
- Oh, no.

994
01:21:56,900 --> 01:22:00,990
The breath had almost totally left
her body. She was as white as snow.

995
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:03,110
And then,

996
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:06,240
she completely pulled back from death,

997
01:22:06,410 --> 01:22:10,080
and stood up... and put on her clothes,

998
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:13,080
and began to cook
for everyone in the house.

999
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:16,420
The mourners, and me, and herself.

1000
01:22:16,590 --> 01:22:18,960
She ate a meal that could choke a pig.

1001
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:21,260
- That's incredible.
- Yes.

1002
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:28,850
Hi, Pop.

1003
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,560
Oh, my God.

1004
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:37,270
Is he all right?

1005
01:22:38,150 --> 01:22:41,900
My father-in-law's got
this wrong idea in his head.

1006
01:22:44,150 --> 01:22:46,160
Listen, Johnny.

1007
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,490
There's a question I want to ask.

1008
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:51,540
I want you to tell me the truth...
if you can.

1009
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:55,920
Why do men chase women?

1010
01:22:58,460 --> 01:23:00,460
Well uh...

1011
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,760
There's the Bible story.

1012
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:06,930
God.

1013
01:23:07,090 --> 01:23:10,720
God took a rib from Adam...
and made Eve.

1014
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:14,940
Now, maybe men chase women
to get the rib back.

1015
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:17,100
When God took the rib,

1016
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:20,110
he left a big hole there.

1017
01:23:20,270 --> 01:23:23,110
A place where
there used to be something.

1018
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,280
And the women have that.

1019
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:27,360
Now maybe,

1020
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:31,950
just maybe,
a man isn't complete as a man,

1021
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:34,410
without a woman.

1022
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:39,750
Why would a man need
more than one woman?

1023
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:43,550
I don't know.

1024
01:23:44,590 --> 01:23:46,590
Maybe because he fears death.

1025
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:50,720
That's it. That's the reason.

1026
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:52,680
- I don't know!
- No!

1027
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:55,810
That's it. No. Thank you.

1028
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:59,310
Thank you for answering my question.

1029
01:24:03,820 --> 01:24:05,650
Hi.

1030
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:08,570
Hello, Mr Castorini.

1031
01:24:09,910 --> 01:24:11,910
Oh. Hi.

1032
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,870
Where you been?

1033
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:17,710
I don't know where I've been
and I don't know where I'm going.

1034
01:24:17,870 --> 01:24:20,040
All right?

1035
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:23,340
You'll have your eyes opened for you,
my friend.

1036
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,170
- I have my eyes open.
- Oh, yeah?

1037
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:29,340
Well, stick around.
Don't go on any long trips.

1038
01:24:29,510 --> 01:24:34,390
- I don't know what you mean.
- That's the point. I'll say no more.

1039
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,350
You haven't said anything.

1040
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:38,560
And that's all I'm saying.

1041
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:40,480
- Cosmo.
- What?

1042
01:24:40,650 --> 01:24:43,360
I just want you to know,
no matter what you do,

1043
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:46,190
you're gonna die,
just like everybody else.

1044
01:24:46,360 --> 01:24:48,700
Thank you, Rose.

1045
01:24:48,860 --> 01:24:51,120
You're welcome.

1046
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,280
I'm going to bed now.

1047
01:24:56,540 --> 01:24:58,410
I'm going.

1048
01:24:58,580 --> 01:25:00,580
Good.

1049
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:04,840
He doesn't like you.
But thank you for answering my question.

1050
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,550
- You don't know where Loretta is?
- No. No idea.

1051
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:11,800
Mrs Castorini, will you tell Loretta
that I'll come by in the morning?

1052
01:25:11,970 --> 01:25:14,890
- We... We need to talk.
- OK, I'll tell her. OK.

1053
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:17,100
Thank you.

1054
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:22,150
Watch it! The house!

1055
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:00,830
What the hell happened to you?

1056
01:27:00,990 --> 01:27:03,000
I really don't know where to start.

1057
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:07,080
- Your hair's different.
- Ma, everything is different.

1058
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:10,130
- Are you drunk?
- No. Are you drunk?

1059
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:12,300
No. But I have a hangover.

1060
01:27:12,460 --> 01:27:14,470
- Where's Pop?
- Upstairs.

1061
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:18,800
Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.

1062
01:27:18,970 --> 01:27:21,810
What?! He's in Sicily.

1063
01:27:21,930 --> 01:27:24,810
- No more, he's not.
- He's there with his dying mother.

1064
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:26,900
- She recovered.
- She was dying!

1065
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:28,900
It was a miracle.

1066
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:32,650
This is modern times!
There ain't supposed to be miracles.

1067
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,820
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily.

1068
01:27:34,990 --> 01:27:38,990
He came right from the airport.
He wanted to talk to you.

1069
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:43,410
You got a lovebite on your neck.
He's coming back this morning.

1070
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:46,170
Your life's going down the toilet.

1071
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:48,830
Cover up that damn thing!
Put some make-up on it!

1072
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:52,460
All right! Ma, OK, fine!
But you gotta help me.

1073
01:27:52,630 --> 01:27:53,590
Hurry up...

1074
01:27:58,390 --> 01:27:59,510
You get it.

1075
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,680
Answer the door!

1076
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:03,470
Mother?

1077
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:13,940
Hi. Is Loretta home?

1078
01:28:14,070 --> 01:28:15,990
Come on in.

1079
01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:25,540
It's not Johnny.

1080
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:28,790
Ronny!

1081
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:30,460
Is Johnny here?

1082
01:28:30,630 --> 01:28:32,590
- No, but he's coming.
- Good.

1083
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:34,960
We can get this out on the table.

1084
01:28:35,130 --> 01:28:37,550
Hi. I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother.

1085
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:39,760
I'm Rose Castorini.

1086
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:43,390
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

1087
01:28:43,560 --> 01:28:46,230
You got a lovebite on your neck.

1088
01:28:46,350 --> 01:28:49,560
- Your mother's recovered from death.
- Oh, good.

1089
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:52,230
- We're not close. I'm not...
- Ouch!

1090
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,780
- You gotta leave.
- I want to meet the family.

1091
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:56,940
No. Really, you gotta get out of here.

1092
01:28:57,110 --> 01:28:58,950
- Anyone want some oatmeal?
- No, Ma.

1093
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:01,490
Yes, Mrs Castorini. I would love some.

1094
01:29:01,660 --> 01:29:03,620
No, we don't want any oatmeal.

1095
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:05,330
Ma!

1096
01:29:05,490 --> 01:29:07,500
That was a... This is a... Oh!

1097
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:10,750
- Thanks, Ma.
- You're welcome.

1098
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:12,920
- Hi.
- Hi.

1099
01:29:13,790 --> 01:29:16,670
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.

1100
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:22,340
It's very good to meet you, Mr Castorini.

1101
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:27,680
I have a feeling
this is going to be just delicious.

1102
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:32,600
- You're Johnny's brother?
- Yeah.

1103
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,400
Don't look at me like that, OK?

1104
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:43,910
Hi, Pop.

1105
01:29:53,170 --> 01:29:56,880
- What's the matter, Pop?
- I'm old.

1106
01:29:57,050 --> 01:29:59,050
The old are not wanted.

1107
01:29:59,210 --> 01:30:01,970
And if they say it, they have no weight.

1108
01:30:02,590 --> 01:30:05,300
But, my son... I must speak.

1109
01:30:06,140 --> 01:30:10,770
You must pay for the wedding
of your only daughter.

1110
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:14,190
You break your house through pride.

1111
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:16,900
There.

1112
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:19,940
- I... I've said it.
- It's OK, Pop.

1113
01:30:20,110 --> 01:30:23,910
If she gets married...
I'll pay for the whole thing.

1114
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:31,330
Now you're talking.

1115
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:36,340
Let's eat.

1116
01:30:44,890 --> 01:30:47,100
Have I been a good wife?

1117
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:49,810
Yeah.

1118
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:55,650
I want you to stop seeing her.

1119
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:25,220
OK.

1120
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:32,270
And go to confession.

1121
01:31:34,390 --> 01:31:38,860
A man understands one day
that his life is built on nothing

1122
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:42,610
and that's a bad, crazy day.

1123
01:31:47,490 --> 01:31:51,540
Your life is not built on nothing.

1124
01:32:23,570 --> 01:32:25,570
- It's Johnny, I'll get it.
- I'll get it.

1125
01:32:25,740 --> 01:32:27,910
- I should tell him.
- I will.

1126
01:32:28,070 --> 01:32:29,820
What am I gonna tell him?

1127
01:32:29,990 --> 01:32:33,870
Tell him the truth, Loretta.
They find out anyway.

1128
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:36,620
You're right, Papa.

1129
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,920
- Hi, Loretta.
- Hi.

1130
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,930
- Hi, Loretta.
- Hi.

1131
01:32:48,090 --> 01:32:50,510
Why aren't you two at the store?

1132
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:53,560
Do you have something
you wanna tell us, honey?

1133
01:32:54,180 --> 01:32:56,180
No.

1134
01:32:58,190 --> 01:33:00,230
We just come from the bank.

1135
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,400
Yeah.

1136
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:05,440
Oh, my God! I forgot to make the deposit!

1137
01:33:05,610 --> 01:33:07,190
Oh, she's got it.

1138
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:10,160
- I knew she had it!
- We didn't know what to think.

1139
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:12,620
You were so weird yesterday.

1140
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:16,290
And then we went to the bank
this morning, and no bag.

1141
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:18,460
We never suspected you.

1142
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:21,130
Listen, would anyone like some coffee?

1143
01:33:21,290 --> 01:33:23,290
That's a good idea.

1144
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:26,760
- What's with this suspected?
- I'll tell you later.

1145
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:28,720
I forgot to make the deposit.

1146
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,680
Sit down. Have some coffee.

1147
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:47,360
- So what are we doing?
- Waiting. For Johnny Cammareri.

1148
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:51,490
My name's Ronny.

1149
01:33:51,660 --> 01:33:53,660
Johnny's brother.

1150
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:58,040
Oh. Nice to meet you.
I'm Rita Cappomaggi.

1151
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:01,420
- Raymond Cappomaggi. Rose's brother.
- Hi.

1152
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:16,470
Someone tell a joke.

1153
01:34:23,980 --> 01:34:25,770
I'll get it.

1154
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:36,370
I thought Johnny was in Palermo.

1155
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:43,460
It's Johnny Cammareri!

1156
01:34:47,540 --> 01:34:48,920
Loretta?

1157
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:55,260
Ronny!

1158
01:34:57,760 --> 01:35:00,810
- Have you come to make peace with me?
- Yes.

1159
01:35:00,970 --> 01:35:02,980
But...

1160
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,600
you may not want to.

1161
01:35:05,770 --> 01:35:07,770
Ronny, of course I want to.

1162
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:10,650
Johnny, your mother was dying.
How did she recover?

1163
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:14,360
I told her we were to be married
and she got well right away!

1164
01:35:14,530 --> 01:35:16,570
- I'm sure she did!
- It was a miracle.

1165
01:35:18,370 --> 01:35:21,290
Johnny,
I have something I have to tell you.

1166
01:35:21,450 --> 01:35:25,210
And I have something to tell you.
But I must talk to you alone.

1167
01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:27,880
No, I need my family around me now.

1168
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:31,550
Loretta,

1169
01:35:31,710 --> 01:35:33,720
I can't marry you.

1170
01:35:34,090 --> 01:35:35,470
What?!

1171
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:39,220
- If I marry you, my mother will die!
- What do you mean? We're engaged!

1172
01:35:39,390 --> 01:35:41,520
Loretta, what are you talking about?

1173
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:44,100
I'm talking about a promise?
He proposed!

1174
01:35:44,270 --> 01:35:46,350
My mother was dying and now she's not!

1175
01:35:46,520 --> 01:35:49,190
You're 42 years old.
She's still running your life.

1176
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:51,280
And you don't love your mother!

1177
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:54,320
You are a big liar.
Because I have a ring right here.

1178
01:35:54,490 --> 01:35:56,490
Oh, I must ask for that back.

1179
01:35:56,910 --> 01:36:00,740
- All right. The engagement is off!
- You will see this is the best thing.

1180
01:36:00,910 --> 01:36:03,910
And you'll drop dead
and I'll mourn you in a red dress!

1181
01:36:04,080 --> 01:36:06,080
- Loretta...
- What?

1182
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:09,330
- Will you marry me?
- What?!

1183
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:11,500
Where's the ring?

1184
01:36:13,420 --> 01:36:15,420
Johnny.

1185
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:17,760
Can I borrow that ring?

1186
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,600
Thanks.

1187
01:36:31,820 --> 01:36:33,820
Loretta Castorini,

1188
01:36:34,740 --> 01:36:36,740
will you marry me?

1189
01:36:38,610 --> 01:36:41,740
Yes, Ronny.
In front of all these people, I'll marry you.

1190
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:44,910
- Do you love him, Loretta?
- Ma, I love him awful.

1191
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:47,080
Oh, God. That's too bad.

1192
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:50,420
She loves me.

1193
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:59,470
What's the matter, Pop?

1194
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:00,800
I'm confused.

1195
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:13,900
To Loretta and Ronny!

1196
01:37:17,900 --> 01:37:20,410
There we are! Thank you, thank you.

1197
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:25,040
Come on, Raymond!

1198
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:31,380
- Come, come. Your brother is here and...
- No, I don't want any.

1199
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:35,800
<i>You are a part of the family.
Don't you realise? Come on, bevi!</i>

1200
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:43,890
Everybody, come on! Glass in hand!

1201
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:49,560
To... to family!

1202
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:51,730
To family!
