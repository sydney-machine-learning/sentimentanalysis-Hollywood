- Good evening.
- Is this the penthouse?
- Yes, ma'am.
- On the roof.

62
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:19,924
Welcome to another edition of
<i>Lifestyles of the Average and Anxious.</i>

63
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:23,158
We move about the apartment
of Peter Mitchell...

64
00:04:23,247 --> 00:04:25,886
young architect about town.

65
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:30,643
It's his late 30s-- Or is it his
early 40s? We'll never know--

66
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:32,479
- birthday party!
- Hi!

67
00:04:32,567 --> 00:04:35,639
Entranced by
the euphoria and ease...

68
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:38,321
these glamourous people exude...

69
00:04:38,407 --> 00:04:41,922
I think I spy
the birthday boy himself.

70
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:44,202
Peter!
How are you, old chum?

71
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:46,960
You're looking so well, so well.

72
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:52,804
Over here is his semi-main squeeze,
Rebecca Davidson.

73
00:04:52,887 --> 00:04:58,007
The public wants to know
what an attractive,
witty, successful woman sees...

74
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:00,203
in a bozo like my roommate.

75
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,245
Well, he's, um,
he's charming and he's sweet.

76
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:06,364
He's very thoughtful.
He's sort of boyishly handsome.

77
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:10,838
But he has got
the most amazing--

78
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:15,557
- Thank you, Rebecca.
- You're welcome, Michael.

79
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:20,084
So, Peter, tell me, are you
and Rebecca still exclusive? Hmm?

80
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:22,727
- Me and Rebecca?
- Yeah.
- No, we both see other people.

81
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:25,401
- Oh, really? Oh.
- Yeah, a lot.
- Oh, that's nice to know.

82
00:05:25,487 --> 00:05:28,001
- Bye, Vanessa.
- Bye.

83
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:30,840
- Hey, uh, birthday boy.
- Oh, hi, Adam.

84
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:33,157
- Rebecca's looking sexier than ever.
- Yeah.

85
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:37,240
- You two, uh, still together?
- Oh, yeah. Me and Rebecca
for five years now.

86
00:05:37,327 --> 00:05:39,318
- Tight. Tight as ever. Excuse me.
- Cool.

87
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:44,996
<i>- Good lovin'</i>
<i>- Gimme that good, good lovin'</i>

88
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,317
<i>- Good lovin'</i>
<i>-All I need is good lovin'</i>

89
00:05:47,407 --> 00:05:49,318
<i>- Good lovin'</i>
-James!

90
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:51,841
- Yeah, baby.
- Remember the Young Rascals?
What happened to them?

91
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:54,395
- Man, they old.
- No, don't say that.
- Real old.

92
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:57,445
- I think one of them's a senator now.
- No, God, no, no!

93
00:05:57,527 --> 00:06:00,280
- A real old senator!
-Jack.Jack. Can I talk
to you for a minute?

94
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:02,562
Paul, I'm serious. I'm not doing
commercials any more. Really.

95
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:06,765
No more talking T-bones
or cowboys with heartburn.
I'm only doing serious stuff now.

96
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,758
- Hi. How are ya?
- Oh,Jack.

97
00:06:08,847 --> 00:06:11,680
Whew! Angela. Whew, boy,
you look different. What happened?

98
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:13,917
- I'm dressed.
- That's it. That's it.

99
00:06:17,207 --> 00:06:20,961
<i>Everybody gather 'round now</i>

100
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,356
<i>Move your body to the beat</i>

101
00:06:27,807 --> 00:06:29,923
Gentlemen, I'm in love.

102
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:32,237
- You?
- Yeah. In a generic sense.

103
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:34,443
- Right. Right.
- Oh, my. Oh.

104
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:36,483
- So many women--
- And so little time.

105
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:39,035
So little time, yeah.

106
00:06:40,287 --> 00:06:42,403
- So,Jack.
- Yeah, what's up?

107
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:45,763
- You're not really gonna
do this movie in Turkey, are ya?
- Yes. Yes, I am.

108
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:48,361
As a matter of fact, I leave
in a few short hours. Here.

109
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:53,601
- What is it, uh, <i>Zalmon the Beautician?</i>
- Barbarian. <i>Zalmon the Barbarian.</i>
I knew you were gonna say that.

110
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:56,520
Okay, well, what about the play in Soho?
The one you said you wanted to do.

111
00:06:56,607 --> 00:06:58,165
- You said it was a chance to--
- Uh, excuse me, please.

112
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:02,160
Excuse me. You said it was
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

113
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:03,362
- Hi.
- Oh, come on.

114
00:07:03,447 --> 00:07:07,679
What d-- What do you want,
my inevitably brilliant reviews,
or, uh, next month's rent?

115
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:11,646
Forget about next month's rent.
I'll cover you, you do the play.

116
00:07:11,727 --> 00:07:15,481
That's sweet of you. You know,
you are a very decent man, Peter.

117
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:19,162
- I'm a goddamned saint.
- ''Saint'' is a little bit much, but--

118
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:22,557
Hey, how's it goin', baby?

119
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:24,877
Name's Johnny. Gimme five.

120
00:07:24,967 --> 00:07:29,199
Ooh, I mean, gimme three.
Yeah. Yeah.

121
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:32,916
I can't believe you draw Johnny Cool.
Coolest cat in the world, right?

122
00:07:33,007 --> 00:07:35,157
No one cooler, baby.

123
00:07:36,047 --> 00:07:39,164
I can't believe it.
Makes me so happy.

124
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:41,886
- What's wrong?
- It's David.

125
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:46,643
- The guy you broke up with?
- The good-looking one.
Incredibly good-looking.

126
00:07:46,727 --> 00:07:50,197
He used to read me Johnny Cool
every morning over breakfast.

127
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:53,518
Hey. Hey, hey.
Oh, you poor baby.

128
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:56,167
You know how
to get over a lover, hmm?

129
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:01,044
Dance with a stranger.

130
00:08:02,727 --> 00:08:04,957
David's an incredible dancer.

131
00:08:05,047 --> 00:08:08,084
He studied for three years
with the Joffrey Ballet.

132
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:11,961
Three years? Joffrey Ballet?

133
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,683
I think you guys
are gonna get back together.

134
00:08:17,767 --> 00:08:21,442
You think that I could call him up
and invite him to the party?

135
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:23,483
Uh, yeah, uh--

136
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,319
<i>Come on, shake your body</i>
<i>Baby, do that conga</i>

137
00:08:25,407 --> 00:08:27,318
<i>I know you can't</i>
<i>control yourself any longer</i>

138
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,398
<i>Feel the rhythm of the beat</i>
<i>It's getting stronger</i>

139
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:32,081
<i>Don't you fight it</i>
<i>till you try to do that conga beat</i>

140
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:35,358
Twins!

141
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:39,445
There it is.

142
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:44,521
Yeah! Arguably one of the best
clutch shots of all time.

143
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:49,727
Forget the guys playing today.
Nobody played this game better
than Reed, West, Chamberlain, Baylor.

144
00:08:49,807 --> 00:08:52,037
I'll run it for you again
in slow motion.

145
00:08:52,127 --> 00:08:55,403
People are asking for you.
Come on, let's go mingle.

146
00:08:55,487 --> 00:08:58,684
I hate that word. It sounds like
something sea lions do before they mate.

147
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:01,235
You are the guest of honour,
and they love you.

148
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:03,716
Of course they do,
but these guys need me in here.
Don't you need me in here, guys?

149
00:09:03,807 --> 00:09:07,516
- Go on, get outta here.
- Leave your money.
- Yeah, we need that.

150
00:09:07,607 --> 00:09:10,519
- Wait, there it is.
- Yeah!

151
00:09:10,607 --> 00:09:13,963
- Undoubtedly, the greatest clutch shot
in basketball history.
- ...clutch shot in basketball...

152
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:16,561
- Unarguably.
- In slow motion.

153
00:09:16,647 --> 00:09:18,239
The best.

154
00:09:19,927 --> 00:09:22,043
Oh, Paul, Paul. Wait, wait.
Listen to me, man.

155
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:24,402
You are my friend.
You're a great director.

156
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:26,682
But I am not doing commercials
ever again. I mean it.

157
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:29,759
Jack, I don't want you to do
a commercial. I need a favour.

158
00:09:29,847 --> 00:09:31,758
Oh. Yeah, all right, shoot. What?

159
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:34,520
I'm having a package delivered tomorrow,
but I won't be home to get it.

160
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:37,679
I gotta go off to San Francisco all week
on a commercial shoot.

161
00:09:37,767 --> 00:09:40,281
- You're gonna shoot in San Francisco?
- Yeah.

162
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:42,597
- Who are you using?
- Oh, Len Peters.

163
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:46,680
Lenny. Lenny. What's wrong? Didn't you
like my last dog food commercial?

164
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:48,803
Oh,Jack, that was a classic.

165
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:51,685
But now look,
I was hoping that I could have
this package delivered here instead.

166
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:53,723
Sure, no problem. No problem.

167
00:09:53,807 --> 00:09:56,605
Listen, let me ask you something here.

168
00:09:56,687 --> 00:10:00,999
- Do you think I'm overexposed?
- Overexposed? Oh, no,Jack, not at all.

169
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,601
Now look, it'll be delivered tomorrow
and picked up by a couple of guys
on Thursday morning.

170
00:10:03,687 --> 00:10:06,076
- That's all there is to it.
- All right. Tomorrow, pick up Thursday.

171
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:09,842
Okay, but this is-- this is
a very delicate matter,Jack, so don't
mention it to anybody, all right?

172
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:12,839
- All right, yeah. Delicate.
<i>- Happy birthday to you</i>

173
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:18,206
<i>Happy birthday, dear Peter</i>

174
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:22,838
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

175
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:28,681
He's so shy.

176
00:10:28,767 --> 00:10:31,964
- Speech! Speech!
- Oh, look, um--

177
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:37,919
First of all, um, uh...

178
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:41,317
I wanna thank, uh,
Jack and Michael and Rebecca...

179
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:46,117
for, uh, embarrassing me
with this unending flow of sentiment.

180
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:48,038
- Oh!
- I, uh--

181
00:10:48,127 --> 00:10:51,039
- Thanks for coming.
- Hey, all right! All right!

182
00:10:51,127 --> 00:10:54,199
- Go on! Blow out the candles! Quick!
- Whoa! Whoa!

183
00:10:57,847 --> 00:11:01,044
I think everybody had a great time.
Don't you?

184
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,436
I sure did.

185
00:11:06,127 --> 00:11:08,641
Why don't you stick around a while?

186
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,721
I thought sentiment
made you uncomfortable.

187
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:16,398
- I can handle it...
- Mm-hmm.

188
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:18,796
as long as it's disguised as sex.

189
00:11:21,087 --> 00:11:23,396
So stay tonight.

190
00:11:27,007 --> 00:11:29,646
I can't.

191
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:32,844
- I have to be up at 7:00
for a pretrial meeting.
- Yeah?

192
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:36,398
Yeah.

193
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:44,916
Happy birthday, Peter. Mmm.

194
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:49,916
Yeah, right.

195
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,396
It was a great party.

196
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:06,126
You know, in this light
you're kinda ugly. Yeah.

197
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:09,438
Yeah, that rut
in the middle of your forehead?
Gettin' out of hand. Out of hand.

198
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,597
- How come that always happens to you?
- What?

199
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,757
Well, as soon as you get
a woman into your room...

200
00:12:13,847 --> 00:12:16,759
you turn into her big brother
and start solving her problems.

201
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:20,840
Well, unlike yourself and our
sexually insatiable roommate...

202
00:12:20,927 --> 00:12:24,840
I happen to be a sensitive guy,
and I have more on my mind
than simply pronging chicks.

203
00:12:24,927 --> 00:12:28,397
Hey, guys. Say, what's a good year
for pronging chicks?

204
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:30,637
The '82 bordeaux on the left
works every time.

205
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:33,195
Thank you very much.

206
00:12:33,287 --> 00:12:35,517
- What happened here? Somebody die?
- Rebecca left early.

207
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:39,395
- Oh.
- Michael saved another
doomed relationship.

208
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:41,637
Post-party depression.

209
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:45,925
Listen, you guys, you know,
I'm outta here tomorrow for ten weeks.

210
00:12:46,007 --> 00:12:48,282
What do you say
I get rid of Cherise--

211
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:52,155
No, no, the three of us
hunker down here with a bottle of wine
and shoot some pool.

212
00:12:52,247 --> 00:12:56,206
I got a better idea.
Why don't you two guys hunker down,
shoot some pool, and I'll, uh, take--

213
00:12:56,287 --> 00:12:59,120
- No, no, no.
- Why don't you just go
and have a good time?

214
00:12:59,207 --> 00:13:02,483
- Yeah, enjoy yourself.
- Oh, guys.

215
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:05,923
Tough job, but it's gotta be done.
Oh.

216
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:09,522
- He's unbelievable.
- The man is one giant gland.

217
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:17,437
-Jack.
- Seventy-nine.

218
00:13:17,527 --> 00:13:20,519
-Jack!
- He left already, Cherise. Eighty.

219
00:13:20,607 --> 00:13:22,723
<i>- Hi, this is Peter, Michael and Jack.</i>
- Great. I think he took my mousse.

220
00:13:22,807 --> 00:13:24,638
<i>- We're out playing</i>
<i>and can't come to the phone.</i>
- That's our boy. Eighty-two.

221
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:27,525
<i>- We'll call you back as soon as we can.</i>
<i>- So leave a message</i>
<i>at the sound of the tone.</i>
- Thanks, Peter. See you around.

222
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,837
Yeah. Eighty-four.

223
00:13:29,927 --> 00:13:33,397
<i>Hi, it's me, Jack. Uh, I'm at the</i>
<i>airport just about to board the plane.</i>

224
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:37,924
<i>But I forgot to tell you something.</i>
<i>There's a package</i>
<i>gonna be delivered today.</i>

225
00:13:38,007 --> 00:13:40,475
<i>Uh, some guys'll pick it up</i>
<i>Thursday before noon.</i>

226
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,956
<i>Just put it aside, don't worry about it.</i>
<i>And, oh, wait a minute.</i>

227
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:46,756
<i>It's, uh, it's a very delicate</i>
<i>matter, so don't, don't say</i>
<i>anything to anybody. Okay?</i>

228
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:51,159
<i>I'll bring you guys something back</i>
<i>from Turkey if you're good.</i>
<i>Maybe a drumstick or somethin'.</i>

229
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,523
<i>- See you later. Bye-bye.</i>
- Ninety.

230
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:07,764
- Hi, Harry.
- Good morning, sir.

231
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:28,002
Michael! Michael, get out here!

232
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:31,601
- What is it?
-Just get out here.

233
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:41,561
What?

234
00:14:42,767 --> 00:14:45,998
- What's goin' on?
- I don't know. What's goin' on?

235
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:48,999
Oh, okay.
Just look out in the hall.

236
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:52,841
- Yeah?
-Just look out in the hall.

237
00:14:54,127 --> 00:14:57,278
Okay.

238
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:02,526
- That's a baby.
- Oh, I know it's a baby.

239
00:15:02,607 --> 00:15:05,724
- What's it doing there?
- It's sleeping.

240
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:08,560
Oh, okay. Who do you
suppose it belongs to?

241
00:15:08,647 --> 00:15:12,196
Oh, Peter, there's a little note.

242
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:15,882
All right, I'll just go in and...

243
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,276
okay, play along.

244
00:15:20,407 --> 00:15:23,205
''Dear Jack, here is our baby--''

245
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:25,323
Oh, no.

246
00:15:25,407 --> 00:15:27,967
- You really don't know
anything about this?
- I knew it.

247
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:31,357
I knew it. I knew this was gonna
happen to him sooner or later.

248
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:35,838
- ''I can't handle this now.
I don't know where else to turn.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right.

249
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:39,124
- ''Someday I hope
you can both forgive me.
- Unbelievable.

250
00:15:39,207 --> 00:15:41,437
Her name is Mary. Love, Sylvia.''
Who's Sylvia?

251
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:45,805
How am I supposed to know?
You have to be a social secretary
to keep track of all his women.

252
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:48,606
He left a message about a package.
He said it'd be delivered today.

253
00:15:48,687 --> 00:15:50,757
He said to put it aside
and not to worry about it.

254
00:15:50,847 --> 00:15:54,044
- He said that about a baby?
- I'd say he takes his procreation
business a little lightly.

255
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:57,437
- So what are we supposed
to do about this?
- We pick it up.

256
00:15:57,527 --> 00:15:59,961
- You pick it up.
- I'm not picking it up.

257
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:02,117
You found it!

258
00:16:07,407 --> 00:16:11,036
- Look, we gotta do something.
One of us has to pick it up.
- Well, it's not gonna be me!

259
00:16:20,087 --> 00:16:22,203
Now what? I don't know anything
about taking care of babies.

260
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:24,517
Well, neither do I!

261
00:16:24,607 --> 00:16:26,916
- Look, we gotta do something!
- Be my guest.

262
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:29,396
- Hey, it's not my responsibility.
- It's not mine either!

263
00:16:29,487 --> 00:16:32,718
- Don't yell at me, Peter.
- Well, it can't be that difficult.

264
00:16:32,807 --> 00:16:34,923
All we gotta do is, is feed it.
It'll shut up.

265
00:16:35,007 --> 00:16:37,475
- Well, I don't know what babies eat.
- Soft stuff.

266
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:40,206
I mean, we were babies once, for God's
sake. What did-- What did we eat?

267
00:16:40,287 --> 00:16:42,847
I don't know. It couldn't have been
very good. I can't remember.

268
00:16:45,727 --> 00:16:49,163
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where you goin'?
- I'm going to the market
to get some baby food.

269
00:16:49,247 --> 00:16:51,203
We can't feed it birthday cake
and goat cheese.

270
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:54,359
- So what am I supposed to do?
- Entertain it.

271
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,756
''Entertain it.''

272
00:16:59,807 --> 00:17:02,844
Entertain it?
How do you entertain a baby?

273
00:17:02,927 --> 00:17:06,397
Hey, junior. Hey, look.
L-Look at my hands. Hey.

274
00:17:06,487 --> 00:17:09,843
Hey. Look at this. Look at this.

275
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:13,363
Oh, it's a-- it's a gla-- it's a prism.
Whoa. Look at those colours, huh?

276
00:17:13,447 --> 00:17:16,598
This is nice stuff, huh? This is
expensive. You don't like that, huh?

277
00:17:16,687 --> 00:17:19,076
Well, how about, uh-- Oh! Ooh, look!
It's almost like, uh--

278
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:22,204
Look,Japanese origami, almost,
with the hands.

279
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:24,437
It's a bird! It's a bird!
No, huh?

280
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:29,762
Uh-- Uh-- I'm gettin' a headache.
You're givin' me a headache.

281
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:32,315
Uh, how about, uh-- how about this?
How about this? Look at this.

282
00:17:32,407 --> 00:17:36,036
Look at the hairy chest.
You like that? You like that?
You wanna-- You want one of these?

283
00:17:36,127 --> 00:17:38,436
Price check!

284
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:42,560
Excuse me. Uh, where could I
get a jar of baby food?

285
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:44,956
- Uh, third aisle to the right.
- Right.

286
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:54,006
-Joe, I need a cheque okay on three.
- It's the larger size?

287
00:17:54,087 --> 00:17:56,555
- Got it.
- This is cheaper.
- Oh.

288
00:18:01,407 --> 00:18:03,363
They gotta be kidding.

289
00:18:03,447 --> 00:18:06,644
What's happenin', baby?
How you doin' today, huh?

290
00:18:06,727 --> 00:18:09,799
My name is Johnny.
That's right. That's right.

291
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:11,957
But you can call me Mr Cool.
You know what I'm sayin'?

292
00:18:12,047 --> 00:18:15,722
Hey, wh-what's your name, huh?
Huh? Haven't I seen you
around the neighbourhood?

293
00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:18,082
Come on, baby, wh-- Wait, what's
the matter? Cat got your tongue?

294
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:21,318
Why can't you talk? Huh? Huh?

295
00:18:24,007 --> 00:18:27,841
Come on, kid, laugh it up.
I'm doin' my best.

296
00:18:31,287 --> 00:18:34,199
<i>Mr Foley, I need</i>
<i>a cheque okay on two.</i>

297
00:18:37,007 --> 00:18:39,805
Excuse me. Uh, is this
a good meal for a baby?

298
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:42,321
- That's for toddlers.
- Toddler? What's a toddler?

299
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:45,558
- Ayear and half, two years.
- No, no, I-I need something for a baby.

300
00:18:45,647 --> 00:18:47,478
- This is your first.
- First what?

301
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:51,242
- Baby.
- Uh, yeah. First and the last.

302
00:18:51,327 --> 00:18:54,478
- No matter how much you prepare, you're
never quite ready for 'em, are you?
- No, you're not.

303
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:57,923
- Um, listen, could you-- Can you hel--
- Did you know that what an infant eats
in its first 1 2 months...

304
00:18:58,007 --> 00:19:01,079
can determine its entire
psychological and physical future?

305
00:19:01,167 --> 00:19:03,635
That's fascinating,
but all I need is some food.

306
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,161
Just some food, that's all, uh, Edna.

307
00:19:06,247 --> 00:19:08,715
- What's the best-selling brand?
- That white can over there.

308
00:19:08,807 --> 00:19:14,040
- Great. This is the best, then?
- No, it's the cheapest.
That's why it sells the most.

309
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:16,436
- Uh-huh. How about this one, then?
- Oh, that's good.

310
00:19:16,527 --> 00:19:18,802
- Good.
- But it's got iron in it.

311
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:21,355
- Is that bad?
- It is if your baby's allergic to it.

312
00:19:21,447 --> 00:19:24,519
- How do you know
if she's allergic to it?
- They throw up all over you.

313
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:28,441
Of course, they throw up all over you
even if they're not allergic to it too.

314
00:19:28,527 --> 00:19:31,166
Some babies can't hold anything down
for more than a minute.

315
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,800
- What about this one?
- That's for older babies.

316
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:37,196
How old's your baby?

317
00:19:39,287 --> 00:19:42,279
- About that old.
- You don't know how old your baby is?

318
00:19:42,367 --> 00:19:44,642
Yes, I do. I know--
I know how old my baby is.

319
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:46,319
- Is she teething?
- Teething?

320
00:19:46,407 --> 00:19:48,967
Well, you know, uh,
does she cry all night?

321
00:19:49,047 --> 00:19:51,038
Does she chew on her fist
and drool a lot?

322
00:19:51,127 --> 00:19:57,157
All right, okay, then I'll take three of
these and I'll take some of these, and
thanks very much for your time, Edna.

323
00:19:58,927 --> 00:20:01,487
You've been a source of great stress.

324
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,765
Don't forget, if the baby's
less than three months old,
you gotta sterilize the nipples.

325
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:10,805
Aw, shit!

326
00:20:13,207 --> 00:20:15,004
Here I come!

327
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:27,479
Hey, hey, hey, look, I'll, uh-- I'll
give you ten bucks if you stop crying.
Huh? Ten bucks. Huh? You like that?

328
00:20:29,287 --> 00:20:33,644
Hey, I'm gonna pick you up now, huh?
Here you go, junior. Here you go.

329
00:20:33,727 --> 00:20:36,116
Is that better? No, huh?

330
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:39,597
All right, well, how about,
uh, how about a little walk, huh?
How about a little walk?

331
00:20:39,687 --> 00:20:42,565
Here, hey, wait a minute. Let me--
Let me-- Here you go. Here we go.

332
00:20:42,647 --> 00:20:45,161
Okay. Hey, how 'bout this, huh?

333
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:48,284
There-- N-No, no-no, no-no-no.
We're not gonna keep cryin'.

334
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:51,757
No, no, no, no! No, no!
Hey, wait a minute. Oh, look! Hey!

335
00:20:51,847 --> 00:20:55,556
<i>Rock-a-bye baby</i>
<i>On the treetop</i>

336
00:20:55,647 --> 00:20:58,684
<i>When the bough breaks--</i>

337
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:00,997
<i>Something and something</i>
<i>Something--</i>

338
00:21:01,087 --> 00:21:04,079
Come on. Where the hell is he,
milkin' the cows or somethin'?

339
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:07,000
Hey, look. No, no, no, no, no crying.
No, no, no. No-- No crying.

340
00:21:07,087 --> 00:21:10,238
Hey, wait a minute. Whoa, ooh, no!
You can-- You can drive a guy to drink.
You know that?

341
00:21:10,327 --> 00:21:14,525
No. No, not you.
You're a cute little thing. Yeah, yeah.

342
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,804
Oh, wait a minute. How about--
<i>Hush, little baby, don't you cry</i>

343
00:21:17,887 --> 00:21:21,357
<i>When Peter gets home</i>
<i>I'm gonna punch him in the eye--</i> Hush.

344
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:25,838
All right-- All right, here we are.
Here we are in my room. Yeah.

345
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:28,236
Look-- Look around here.
This is nice, huh?

346
00:21:28,327 --> 00:21:32,081
Uh, uh, maybe you can, uh--
Here, we'll sit down here and, uh--

347
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,442
Oh, look! Look!
We're gonna watch a little TV.

348
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:38,520
Yeah. Yeah. We'll watch a little TV.
Just you and me, huh?

349
00:21:38,607 --> 00:21:42,839
Here you go. There you go.
Amuse yourself.

350
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:46,044
<i>Women are wondering.</i>:
<i>Are they having an orgasm?</i>

351
00:21:46,127 --> 00:21:50,405
<i>- Men are worried</i>
<i>maybe their penis isn't--</i>
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

352
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:54,321
No, no, no, no, no, you don't want
to hear that. No, no, no, no, no.

353
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:57,963
Okay, we're gonna have a nice
conversation with Uncle Peter...

354
00:21:58,047 --> 00:22:00,197
and let him have some fun now, yeah?

355
00:22:00,287 --> 00:22:03,757
Yeah, that's a good idea.
Where the hell have you been?

356
00:22:03,847 --> 00:22:06,202
- Oh, hi, Mrs Hathaway.
- Mr Kellam, this package just arri--

357
00:22:06,287 --> 00:22:09,006
- Oh, what a darling little baby.
- Yeah.

358
00:22:09,087 --> 00:22:11,362
- Is it yours?
- No, no, no, no. It's not mine.

359
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:15,326
- Mr Mitchell's?
- No, no, no, no, no.
Someone sort of loaned it to us.

360
00:22:15,407 --> 00:22:18,285
- W-We're watching her for a while.
- Well, what is its name?

361
00:22:18,367 --> 00:22:21,279
Her name is, uh, it's, uh, Sylvia.

362
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:23,756
No, Mary. Mary. Mary. Yeah.

363
00:22:23,847 --> 00:22:26,281
Well, we've had a tough morning,
and we're all tuckered out.

364
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:29,120
We've been drooling, so, uh,
we're gonna just say goodbye, okay?

365
00:22:29,207 --> 00:22:32,597
- Bye-bye, Mrs Hathaway. Bye-bye. Yeah.
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

366
00:22:32,687 --> 00:22:37,807
Oh, by the way, um, this package
just arrived for you downstairs.

367
00:22:37,887 --> 00:22:41,357
Uh, all right, great. Great.
Th-Thanks, Mrs Hathaway.

368
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:44,245
- Could I hold her for just a minute?
- Oh, I don't think so.
She doesn't really--

369
00:22:44,327 --> 00:22:47,842
I just love babies. Oh, yes.

370
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:51,796
I just love babies.

371
00:22:51,887 --> 00:22:55,800
Unfortunately, Mr Hathaway and I
were never able to have any of our own.

372
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:59,118
- Mr Hathaway has a low sperm count.
- Well, some guys have all the luck.

373
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:01,801
Oh, oh, you are--

374
00:23:01,887 --> 00:23:04,799
You are a cute little bundle,
aren't you?

375
00:23:06,807 --> 00:23:10,402
You do realize she did a doodle.
Yes, you did.

376
00:23:10,487 --> 00:23:14,002
Would you like me to
give you a hand in changing her?

377
00:23:14,087 --> 00:23:17,159
No. No, no, no, I can do it.
I-I-I'm used to it. I'm used to it.

378
00:23:17,247 --> 00:23:20,205
Well, thanks a lot, Mrs Hathaway.
We gotta go now. All right?

379
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:22,562
So, uh, so we're gonna say bye-bye now.

380
00:23:22,647 --> 00:23:24,922
- All right? Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye, Mary.

381
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:27,840
- Bye-bye. Bye. Bye-bye. Okay, bye.
- Little child.

382
00:23:27,927 --> 00:23:30,077
Of course, if you ever need
anyone to babysit--

383
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:32,044
All right. Yeah? All right.
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

384
00:23:32,127 --> 00:23:35,199
- Mr Mitchell, she's a lovely baby.
- Yeah, adorable.

385
00:23:35,287 --> 00:23:38,597
Where the hell have you been?
This baby hasn't stopped crying
since you left, and she did a doodle.

386
00:23:38,687 --> 00:23:42,396
''Doodle''? What the hell's that?
No, don't tell me. I don't want to know.

387
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:45,320
Oh, you're gonna know, pal, 'cause
she did it. What's with all the bags?

388
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:49,320
I had to go to three different places to
buy four different kinds of formula...

389
00:23:49,407 --> 00:23:54,003
two different kinds of diapers,
bottles, towels, nipples.

390
00:23:54,087 --> 00:23:56,476
You have no idea
how much crap these kids need.

391
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:59,081
- How old is she, anyway?
- How should I know? You want me
to check her driver's licence?

392
00:23:59,167 --> 00:24:01,317
- Feel her teeth.
- What?
-Just feel her teeth.

393
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:03,921
The druggist said that you can tell
how old she is by feeling her teeth.

394
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:07,204
Well, I'm not feeling her teeth!
You feel her teeth!
I'm tired of holding her, anyway! Here!

395
00:24:07,287 --> 00:24:10,040
No! Uh, no, I can't hold her and,
and make her bottle at the same time.

396
00:24:10,127 --> 00:24:13,039
All right, I'll hold her,
you check for the teeth, okay?

397
00:24:14,607 --> 00:24:17,121
- Come on!
- All right.

398
00:24:23,927 --> 00:24:25,599
- I can't feel anything.
- What do you think that means?

399
00:24:25,687 --> 00:24:29,282
- It means she doesn't
have any damn teeth!
- Well, neither did Gabby Hayes,
and he was 90! So what?

400
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:32,962
All right, then we'll give her
the stuff for newborns,
hope she's not allergic to it.

401
00:24:33,047 --> 00:24:37,040
You have no idea how much stuff
these kids can be allergic to.
What's that stench?

402
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:41,006
Michael, hold her.
Just hold her. That's it.

403
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:44,921
- Wait a minute. Peter, this is a girl.
Should we be doing this?
- Michael, just hold her, will ya,
so I can get the diaper off.

404
00:24:46,407 --> 00:24:48,796
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

405
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,243
How can something so small create
so much of something so disgusting?

406
00:24:52,327 --> 00:24:56,161
Oh, God. Beats the shit out of me.
All right, hand me the other diaper.
There, take--

407
00:24:57,967 --> 00:25:00,197
- Wait a minute.
Shouldn't we wash her first?
- Uh, we'll wash her later.

408
00:25:00,287 --> 00:25:03,518
Just-- Well, give me the cotton.
Give me the-- Oh!

409
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:06,405
How about this?

410
00:25:06,487 --> 00:25:08,523
Come on. Uh, Michael, I--
Just give me a little cotton.

411
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:10,404
- I don't need a package.
I just need some cotton.
- All right, here.

412
00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:13,524
Oh, no, wait, g-- The wipies. Get me the
g-- the, you know, the cotton wipies.

413
00:25:13,607 --> 00:25:15,916
Right.

414
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,241
Here it is.

415
00:25:20,327 --> 00:25:22,921
- All right.
- Ooh, this is disgusting.

416
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:26,920
It's all over, and it's, it's--
it's sticky and--

417
00:25:27,007 --> 00:25:29,919
We're gonna need some kind of
cleaning fluid to get it off.

418
00:25:30,007 --> 00:25:33,556
- How about after-shave?
- Aw, come on, Michael!
Just get me one of the diapers!

419
00:25:33,647 --> 00:25:35,365
All right.

420
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:41,762
All right, good. Now, these tape things
go in the front or the back?

421
00:25:41,847 --> 00:25:45,396
- Uh, how am I supposed to know?
- Okay. There.

422
00:25:45,487 --> 00:25:47,717
Whoa! These diapers are way too big.

423
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:50,879
- What size did you get, adult?
- They're ultra-absorbent.

424
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:53,162
The more absorbent the better,
if you ask me.

425
00:25:53,247 --> 00:25:55,636
Will you hold her for a minute?
The kid's going crazy. I--

426
00:25:55,727 --> 00:25:57,319
- I don't want to.
- Come on, Michael!

427
00:25:57,407 --> 00:25:59,875
- Hey, don't pull that so hard.
It's gonna rip.
- I'm not gonna rip it.

428
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:02,276
Yes, you are.

429
00:26:02,367 --> 00:26:05,439
All right, well, okay, uh, get me
another diaper. I'll use the tape.

430
00:26:05,527 --> 00:26:09,076
I'll use the tape from the diaper,
I'll tape it up.
I'm an architect, for Christ's sakes.

431
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:12,239
I build 50-storey skyscrapers.
I assemble cities of the future.

432
00:26:12,327 --> 00:26:15,205
I can certainly put together
a goddam diaper.

433
00:26:15,287 --> 00:26:17,482
Take it easy, kid, all right?

434
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:23,160
There. There. See? It's working.

435
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:26,205
Piece of cake. There. Yeah.

436
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:30,799
Nice job, Pete.

437
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:44,401
The little insect was just waiting
for that diaper to fall off.

438
00:26:44,487 --> 00:26:47,240
I think we're in trouble.

439
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:55,876
I'm gonna kill Jack.

440
00:26:58,007 --> 00:26:59,520
I'm gonna kill him.

441
00:27:09,647 --> 00:27:12,002
- This is the deal. Yeah, that's it.
- Michael.

442
00:27:12,087 --> 00:27:14,647
- What?
- You're gonna have to wash
where the poop was.

443
00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:17,480
- Now, come on.
- All righty.

444
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:19,717
- Come on.
- I've got that handled.
- No, no, just--

445
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:22,037
- Perfect.
- You're not getting
anything off that way.

446
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:25,164
There. There you go.

447
00:27:25,247 --> 00:27:27,078
- That's clean. Isn't that clean?
- Yeah, right.

448
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:29,078
- And her-- her privates.
- I'll rinse her.

449
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,601
- All right. Rinse her out a little bit.
- There we go.

450
00:27:31,687 --> 00:27:35,600
Okay. This says--
This says ''For moisturizing and--''

451
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,201
- Don't use the baby lotion now.
It's lotion.
- Well, it says---

452
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:40,755
- It says ''Prevents
chapping and chaffing.''
-Just wash the baby.

453
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:44,681
Well, I should put some in there anyway
just to sort of make sure she's not--

454
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,685
Okay.

455
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:50,077
We gotta get some help.

456
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:55,958
Jack said this is a delicate situation,
that we shouldn't tell anybody.

457
00:28:56,047 --> 00:29:01,405
Can you believe him, putting us through
hell to save his precious reputation?

458
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:03,796
I'm not doing it any more.

459
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:08,285
Odds.

460
00:30:16,807 --> 00:30:19,116
Willie, they need you
over here a minute.

461
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:25,761
Make a little room.

462
00:30:25,847 --> 00:30:30,159
- Well, at least it ain't rainin'.
- You're gonna have a headache.
- Try sleepin' nights, Peter.

463
00:30:30,927 --> 00:30:33,680
Mary, let me have the pen.

464
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:37,396
Come on. Come on. I'm later than usual
this week for the deadline.

465
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:40,559
Come here. Okay-- Oh!

466
00:30:48,887 --> 00:30:51,799
Actually, Sam, I-- I don't seem
to have them here after all.

467
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:56,403
I must have left them at the office,
but, uh, I'll get them
first thing in the morning. Right.

468
00:30:58,687 --> 00:31:00,996
Your daddy's a dead man.

469
00:31:09,807 --> 00:31:12,560
- Rebecca, you're--
- Yeah, I came as soon as I got
your messages. What's the emer--

470
00:31:12,647 --> 00:31:15,286
- Who are-- Who are you?
- Um--
-Jan.

471
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:19,201
- This is Jan Clopatz.
This is Peter Mitchell.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do? Come on.

472
00:31:19,287 --> 00:31:21,676
Jan is a cellist from Hungary.

473
00:31:21,767 --> 00:31:24,440
He's playing with the Brauslau
Baroque Ensemble at Carnegie Hall.

474
00:31:24,527 --> 00:31:27,599
- What a thrill.
- Peter, what's the emergency?

475
00:31:27,687 --> 00:31:31,077
Just come with me.

476
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:33,476
This is the big emergency.

477
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:41,438
- It's a baby.
- Why is that the first thing
everybody says-- ''It's a baby''?
Of course it's a baby.

478
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:43,961
- It's your baby?
- No, it's not my baby.

479
00:31:44,047 --> 00:31:46,163
- It's Jack's baby.
-Jack has a baby?

480
00:31:46,247 --> 00:31:49,922
I realize such a concept
tends to negate our belief
in a benevolent God, but yes.

481
00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:52,726
Well, it doesn't look like Jack.
Jack's got more hair.

482
00:31:52,807 --> 00:31:55,765
I'm glad you can joke at a time
like this. See? She needs to be held.

483
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,759
- Babies like to be held.
- Hmm.

484
00:31:58,847 --> 00:32:00,963
- Where is he?
-Jack? Oh.

485
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:03,880
Jack's in Turkey, which is where I'd be
if my baby was in New York.

486
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:05,923
Now look, Rebecca, we're dying here.

487
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:09,522
Michael doesn't know
anything about babies.
I don't know anything about babies.

488
00:32:09,607 --> 00:32:12,121
On top of that,
I got deadlines hanging all over me.

489
00:32:12,207 --> 00:32:15,643
I've been reading these--
these books about babies.

490
00:32:15,727 --> 00:32:18,036
I can't figure it out.
For instance, it says here-- Look.

491
00:32:18,127 --> 00:32:22,245
''Feed every two hours.'' Well, it takes
me two hours to get her to eat anything.

492
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:24,966
So does it mean feed her
every two hours from when I start?

493
00:32:25,047 --> 00:32:26,765
- Yeah.
- Or every two hours from when I finish?

494
00:32:26,847 --> 00:32:30,806
Because I've been feeding her
every two hours from when I start,
and I'm feeding her all the time!

495
00:32:30,887 --> 00:32:33,560
- Mmm.
- So which is it?

496
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:35,842
- Why are you asking me?
- Because you're a woman.

497
00:32:35,927 --> 00:32:38,680
Yeah. That doesn't mean I automatically
know what to do with babies.

498
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:40,519
Rebecca, now, pl--

499
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:46,126
please, uh, stay with me and,
and help me take care of her.

500
00:32:46,207 --> 00:32:48,516
- You want me to take care of her.
- Yes.

501
00:32:48,607 --> 00:32:52,077
- Now?
- No, when she graduates from college.
Yes, now.

502
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,317
I can't do that, Peter.

503
00:32:54,407 --> 00:32:58,116
Baby take very,
very much work, huh? Yeah.

504
00:32:58,207 --> 00:33:01,517
Thank you for telling me that,Jan.
I didn't know that.
What is he, an idiot savant?

505
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:04,075
Rebecca, we--we'll be late and--

506
00:33:04,167 --> 00:33:07,716
Uh-- W--Uh-- Rebecca, no, now--

507
00:33:09,007 --> 00:33:14,001
Rebecca, please! Stay with me!

508
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:17,204
- I have got a date.
- Oh?

509
00:33:18,527 --> 00:33:20,916
Oh, excuse me for cramping
your romantic style.

510
00:33:21,007 --> 00:33:22,599
Rebecca, we'll be late, huh?

511
00:33:22,687 --> 00:33:25,155
- Uh, just--
- You can't be serious about this guy.

512
00:33:25,247 --> 00:33:28,284
Oh, come on, Peter. You go out
with other people and so do I.
We agreed to that.

513
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:31,200
You can go out with the whole damn
string section for all I care.
That's not the issue.

514
00:33:31,287 --> 00:33:33,676
- Right now I need you here.
- Well, I can't be here now.

515
00:33:33,767 --> 00:33:37,043
- Oh! She doodled.
- Doodled!

516
00:33:37,127 --> 00:33:40,119
Yes, doodled! What's the matter?
Don't babies doodle in Hungary?

517
00:33:40,207 --> 00:33:43,324
- We're leaving.
- Uh, Rebecca, no, wait.

518
00:33:44,727 --> 00:33:47,161
Come on, Rebecca, please. Don't go.

519
00:33:48,487 --> 00:33:51,524
Peter, you're a very big boy,
you're very capable...

520
00:33:51,607 --> 00:33:54,519
and you're gonna get through this
just fine.

521
00:33:57,727 --> 00:34:00,195
I hate the cello.

522
00:34:00,287 --> 00:34:02,642
Don't.

523
00:34:06,087 --> 00:34:10,444
I keep waiting for <i>Candid Camera</i>
to walk through the door.

524
00:34:10,527 --> 00:34:14,725
- What did you cancel for tonight?
- Box seats at Shea. You?

525
00:34:14,807 --> 00:34:17,116
Dinner with Cheryl.

526
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:21,596
Two more days.

527
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:28,997
Where'd you put the baby powder?

528
00:34:29,087 --> 00:34:30,645
I'll get it.

529
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:34,276
What'd you put it out there for? We're
bathing her in here. You should have
brought it in with her bath stuff.

530
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:37,279
- It's just down the hall.
- Well, we're not bathing her
in the hall, are we?

531
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,676
Well, maybe we should start, goddam it!

532
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:43,316
You're going to clean that up.

533
00:34:46,767 --> 00:34:50,203
- What time are those guys
supposed to get here?
-Jack's message said before noon.

534
00:34:50,287 --> 00:34:52,517
Good. I gotta see my editor
about 1 :00.

535
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:57,563
Michael, did you move my blueprints? I
need 'em for my meeting this afternoon.

536
00:35:01,647 --> 00:35:03,365
Sorry.

537
00:35:12,727 --> 00:35:15,639
I think she did a doodle.
Your turn to change her.

538
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:19,561
I'll give you a thousand dollars
if you'll do it.

539
00:35:26,807 --> 00:35:29,002
Check this out.

540
00:35:30,287 --> 00:35:32,596
What do you know?

541
00:35:34,287 --> 00:35:36,596
Coming! Coming!

542
00:35:38,607 --> 00:35:40,916
- Does, uh,Jack Holden live here?
- Yeah.

543
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:43,840
- Someone asked us to pick up a package.
- A package?

544
00:35:43,927 --> 00:35:47,317
I love the way everybody
keeps calling it a package.

545
00:35:47,407 --> 00:35:51,286
You can tell Sylvia for us
that she's got a lot of nerve
dumping her problems in our laps.

546
00:35:51,367 --> 00:35:54,120
- Who's Sylvia?
- When it first got here,
we considered calling the cops.

547
00:35:54,207 --> 00:35:57,165
- Hey, w-- Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait. No, no, w--
- But we didn't. We stuck it out, even
though it totally disrupted our lives.

548
00:35:57,247 --> 00:36:00,444
No, you wait. Hey, we haven't
been able to work or to sleep.

549
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:02,995
- And there's been shit
all over this place for days.
- ''Shit''?

550
00:36:03,087 --> 00:36:05,521
- What?
- You mean the package? It busted?

551
00:36:05,607 --> 00:36:08,405
Busted? Yeah.
Yeah, you could say that.

552
00:36:08,487 --> 00:36:12,400
- Well, did you put the shit back?
- Put it back? No, we had it bronzed for
posterity. What do you think we did?

553
00:36:12,487 --> 00:36:14,796
Michael.

554
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:20,398
Her next bottle's in 45 minutes. I
made it up already. It's in the basket.

555
00:36:22,087 --> 00:36:24,601
- It's a baby.
- You're sharp, aren't ya?
He's all right, huh?

556
00:36:24,687 --> 00:36:27,565
Twenty minutes after she eats,
she gets tired. Put her to bed.

557
00:36:27,647 --> 00:36:31,322
- And I'm getting you a can
of powdered milk.
- Oh, yeah.

558
00:36:31,407 --> 00:36:35,719
- Yeah.
- Right. Powdered milk. Right.
- Yeah, powdered milk.

559
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:39,925
So, all right, so we'll
take the ''powdered milk''
and, uh, we'll get out of here.

560
00:36:49,567 --> 00:36:51,876
What, you want us to take the baby?

561
00:36:51,967 --> 00:36:54,356
That was the arrangement.

562
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:59,276
- Are you sure that's the plan?
- You're damn straight.

563
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:02,996
Well, if you say so. Let's go.

564
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:05,840
- You won't forget what we said?
- No.

565
00:37:05,927 --> 00:37:08,964
And she likes to be
rocked to sleep. Gently.

566
00:37:09,047 --> 00:37:13,802
Gently. Absolutely. Gently.
I-I can handle it.

567
00:37:13,887 --> 00:37:17,402
Maybe you should leave a phone number,
in case you need some advice.

568
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:19,842
Oh, uh, I'll call you.

569
00:37:31,807 --> 00:37:37,006
Do you hear that, Peter?
Just listen. Isn't it wonderful?

570
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:40,682
- Isn't what wonderful?
- Quiet.

571
00:37:40,767 --> 00:37:43,406
Peace and quiet.

572
00:37:43,487 --> 00:37:46,877
There's something screwy going on,
Michael. I got a funny feeling.

573
00:37:46,967 --> 00:37:49,640
What are you talking about?
You've been tense the last five days.

574
00:37:49,727 --> 00:37:52,036
It's just your nerves unwinding.

575
00:37:54,407 --> 00:37:56,716
Maybe you're right.

576
00:38:08,607 --> 00:38:11,121
Michael.

577
00:38:14,007 --> 00:38:16,601
- Michael, what is this?
- A package.

578
00:38:16,687 --> 00:38:19,281
- When did it get here?
- Sunday.

579
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:23,076
- Mrs Hathaway br--
- Go to the window.
See if you can stop them.

580
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:26,045
I gotta try and catch up with them!

581
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:34,643
Hi. Hello.

582
00:38:34,727 --> 00:38:37,002
Yeah, you're beautiful.
Come on. Wanna go for a ride?

583
00:38:42,207 --> 00:38:44,038
Hey! Hey, up here!

584
00:38:53,207 --> 00:38:55,880
- Where am I gonna put this little baby?
- Right on your lap.

585
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:58,800
Huh? No, we need
a little baby car seat, I think.

586
00:38:58,887 --> 00:39:02,641
- Put her in the trunk.
- Yeah? You wanna go for a ride
in the car, in the trunk?

587
00:39:02,727 --> 00:39:04,922
Huh? Wanna go in the trunk?

588
00:39:13,047 --> 00:39:16,960
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

589
00:39:17,047 --> 00:39:19,959
Hey, hey. You wanna try this?
It's an adventure.

590
00:39:21,887 --> 00:39:26,324
Why am I listening to you? Why-- Why do
I listen to you? I mean, this is absurd.
I can't put a little baby in the trunk.

591
00:39:27,807 --> 00:39:30,196
- Hey!
- It's okay. Yeah.

592
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:32,243
- Oh, Mr Wonderful.
- Hey!

593
00:39:32,327 --> 00:39:34,682
-Yeah?
-Look, uh, I gave you the wrong package.

594
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:37,042
- W-W-What wrong package?
What are you talking--
- I made a-- I made a terrible mistake.

595
00:39:37,127 --> 00:39:39,846
I gave you the wrong package.
Look, I've got-- Give me the baby first.

596
00:39:39,927 --> 00:39:42,043
- No. Hey, no-- Take it easy. Be gentle.
- Give me the-- Give me the baby first.

597
00:39:42,127 --> 00:39:44,800
- Give me the baby. Give me the baby.
- Be gentle. You're disturbing the baby.

598
00:39:44,887 --> 00:39:46,366
- Hey, hey, hey, what are you, crazy?
- Give me the baby first.

599
00:39:46,447 --> 00:39:49,280
- Look, hey, Satch.
Hey, listen, this guy's an animal.
- Give me the baby! Please!

600
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:51,642
I keep him chained to the wall.
I feed him raw meat.

601
00:39:51,727 --> 00:39:54,719
- Hey! What's goin' on here?
- Oh, God, it's Roy and Trigger.

602
00:39:54,807 --> 00:39:57,321
- I said, what's goin' on here?
- Nothing, Officer.

603
00:39:57,407 --> 00:40:01,082
- You gonna ride
with that kid in the trunk?
- No! Of course not. That's absurd.

604
00:40:01,167 --> 00:40:04,204
I mean, it's unhealthy for the child,
and it's illegal also, I understand.

605
00:40:04,287 --> 00:40:05,766
- No, he's not, Officer.
Give me the baby.
- Yeah--

606
00:40:05,847 --> 00:40:08,759
- All right, let me see
your licence and registration.
- Why?

607
00:40:08,847 --> 00:40:11,486
- Why?
- Yeah, why?
- 'Cause you're double-parked, wise guy!

608
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:13,478
- Oh. Why-- All right.
Wait a minute. What's--
- Give me the baby.

609
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:16,923
Just be gentle. Be gentle. Be gentle.

610
00:40:17,007 --> 00:40:19,157
- Hey. Stay there.
- One second, Officer.
I'll be right with you.

611
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,516
Book! Book! Book! Book!

612
00:40:23,607 --> 00:40:26,679
Hey, come back here! You, freeze!

613
00:40:28,847 --> 00:40:32,886
I have no intention of moving, Officer.
I'm not a criminal, I'm an architect.

614
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:35,879
- W-With a baby. See?
- Ah, let me see some I.D.

615
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:39,004
Oh, yeah, sure.

616
00:40:39,087 --> 00:40:42,397
- I don't have any with me.
- Up against the car. Spread 'em.

617
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:45,081
Uh, Officer, look, uh, uh,
my wallet's up in my apartment.

618
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:47,601
It's right up there. You can
come up with me. You're welcome to.

619
00:40:47,687 --> 00:40:52,886
Uh, uh, I-I'll some you some I.D,
but I'm not gonna spread 'em because
I have a baby, as you can plainly see.

620
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:55,276
All right, architect, let's go.

621
00:41:00,887 --> 00:41:04,197
Here we are. Come on in. Can I
get you a cup of coffee or something?

622
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:06,243
No, thanks.
I'll just wait here by the door.

623
00:41:06,327 --> 00:41:09,125
Michael!
I'll just be a second.

624
00:41:09,207 --> 00:41:12,438
Come with me, Michael.
Here we go. I'm coming.

625
00:41:12,527 --> 00:41:16,520
Uh, just listen. The package
those guys came for is full of drugs.

626
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:19,519
- What?
- Drugs. All right, here.

627
00:41:20,807 --> 00:41:23,196
- Coming. Do something with it.
- Like what?

628
00:41:23,287 --> 00:41:26,199
Hide it. I gotta show him some I.D.
I'm coming.

629
00:41:29,567 --> 00:41:34,277
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
There you are.
- Would you mind removing that
from the cover, please?

630
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:37,882
- Well, sure.
- Thank you.

631
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:42,205
Shh, shh. Shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh.

632
00:41:42,287 --> 00:41:45,563
Shh. Sure. Shh. Shh. Shh.

633
00:41:45,647 --> 00:41:48,559
Thanks for coming up, Officer.
I hope it hasn't been an inconvenience.

634
00:41:48,647 --> 00:41:51,002
And if there's anything else
I can do for you, just let me know.

635
00:41:51,087 --> 00:41:53,396
I was just doin' my job.

636
00:41:55,447 --> 00:42:00,157
Hi. I'm Detective Sergeant Melkowitz,
Narcotics.

637
00:42:00,247 --> 00:42:02,203
Officer, you can go down
and saddle up now.

638
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,596
- Yes, sir.
- I'll handle this.

639
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:13,916
Aren't you gonna ask me in?

640
00:42:21,367 --> 00:42:24,882
Can I, uh, get you a cup of coffee,
some water, a beer?

641
00:42:24,967 --> 00:42:27,242
No, no. No, thanks, I'm fine.

642
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:29,079
Ah.

643
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:33,479
- You don't mind me asking
a few questions, do you?
- No, not at all.

644
00:42:33,567 --> 00:42:36,035
- Is that your baby
I saw you with downstairs?
- No.

645
00:42:36,127 --> 00:42:38,436
Uh, well, um, it's my roommate Jack's.

646
00:42:38,527 --> 00:42:41,041
Well, who were those two men
I saw you talking to?

647
00:42:41,127 --> 00:42:45,723
Friends. Of the mother's.
They were gonna take her for a ride.

648
00:42:45,807 --> 00:42:48,116
The baby! Baby. Not the mother.

649
00:42:48,207 --> 00:42:51,438
But they couldn't, see,
because they brought the wrong car.
There's no baby seat.

650
00:42:53,047 --> 00:42:57,484
Well, do you mind if I have a look at
that baby? I just love little babies.

651
00:42:57,567 --> 00:43:00,923
She's sleeping.

652
00:43:01,007 --> 00:43:03,965
Sounds like she's awake to me.
Do you mind if I see her?

653
00:43:04,047 --> 00:43:06,845
I don't know. You know,
she doesn't really like strangers.

654
00:43:06,927 --> 00:43:10,397
- She may not be decent.
- Oh, I don't think she'll mind.

655
00:43:12,887 --> 00:43:17,756
Well, there she is.
And she's got a friend.

656
00:43:17,847 --> 00:43:19,963
Oh, yeah,
this is my, uh, other roommate.

657
00:43:20,047 --> 00:43:22,242
Uh, Detective Melkowitz,
this is Michael Kellam.

658
00:43:22,327 --> 00:43:25,956
- Hello.
- Oh, what a cutie.

659
00:43:26,047 --> 00:43:28,083
Do you mind if I hold her?
I just love kids.

660
00:43:28,167 --> 00:43:30,317
Well, I'd rather not, actually.
She's, um--

661
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:34,923
- Go ahead, Michael. It won't hurt her.
- Uh, well, you know how she is
around people, Peter. She's so--

662
00:43:35,007 --> 00:43:39,842
Michael, will you let him hold her.
He's not gonna hurt her.
He's a police officer.

663
00:43:39,927 --> 00:43:42,043
- All right.
- Oh.
- Yeah.

664
00:43:43,527 --> 00:43:46,246
Oh. Oh.

665
00:43:51,407 --> 00:43:54,160
You're a heavy little girl,
aren't you?

666
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:59,801
Yes. Yes, she really is heavy,
isn't she?

667
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,162
- She's a good eater.
- Yeah. That's a good sign.

668
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:05,398
It means she won't grow up
to be a nervous adult.

669
00:44:05,487 --> 00:44:08,604
You've got nothing to be nervous about,
have you, sweetie?

670
00:44:11,807 --> 00:44:14,275
- Feels as though
she's ready for a change.
- Oh.
- Yeah.

671
00:44:14,367 --> 00:44:17,404
- Oh. You know babies.
- Yep.
- All they do is eat, sleep and poop.

672
00:44:17,487 --> 00:44:20,047
- Here, Michael.
- Yeah, I'll take her.
- Good idea.

673
00:44:20,127 --> 00:44:22,721
Oh, what a cute little baby.

674
00:44:22,807 --> 00:44:24,923
Uh, do you happen to know
where her father is at the moment?

675
00:44:25,007 --> 00:44:28,716
- No. Uh, yeah, he's on location,
uh, doing a TV movie.
- Huh?

676
00:44:28,807 --> 00:44:32,243
- But I-I don't have any idea where.
- Uh, do you know this guy?

677
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:40,683
Oh, not very well. He's a friend of
Jack's. Uh, I don't remember his name.

678
00:44:40,767 --> 00:44:44,077
His name is Paul Milner.
He directs TV commercials.

679
00:44:44,167 --> 00:44:47,682
And on the side, he just happens to
dabble in a little heroin smuggling.

680
00:44:50,367 --> 00:44:53,803
- Really?
- Yeah.

681
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:56,082
I don't know him. I don't--

682
00:44:56,167 --> 00:44:59,716
I'd appreciate that glass of water now,
Mr Mitchell.

683
00:44:59,807 --> 00:45:02,605
- Of course. No problem.
- Thank you.

684
00:45:04,887 --> 00:45:06,798
I got it.

685
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:20,283
<i>- Hi, this is Peter...</i>
<i>- Michael...</i>
<i>- and Jack.</i>

686
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:22,801
<i>- We're out playing</i>
<i>and we can't come to the phone--</i>
<i>- But we'll call you back.</i>

687
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:25,526
- Shit!
<i>- So please leave a message</i>
<i>at the sound of the tone.</i>

688
00:45:25,607 --> 00:45:28,485
- Hold on. Whoever it is, I'm here.
<i>- Uh, Peter! Jack.</i>

689
00:45:28,567 --> 00:45:33,357
Yeah, how are you? L-Listen, uh,
I got a message saying you're trying
to get through to me. What's up?

690
00:45:33,447 --> 00:45:39,841
Jack, Michael and I really have to
talk to you, but, uh, uh, you called us
at a bad time. We'll call back later.

691
00:45:39,927 --> 00:45:42,839
<i>Wh-whoa, wait a minute! Wait a minute!</i>
<i>Don't hang up. I'm calling from Turkey.</i>

692
00:45:42,927 --> 00:45:46,966
<i>It took me an hour to put this call</i>
<i>through. It's not an easy place</i>
<i>to phone from, you know.</i>

693
00:45:47,047 --> 00:45:49,436
Hey, Peter, this place is amazing.

694
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:52,485
<i>You will not believe some of the stuff</i>
<i>I bought for you guys.</i>

695
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:55,559
-Jack!
<i>- I mean, the shit is so cheap here.</i>

696
00:45:55,647 --> 00:45:58,639
<i>I probably bought too much of it,</i>
<i>but what the hell,</i>
<i>I can always smuggle it in.</i>

697
00:45:59,847 --> 00:46:01,838
-Just kidding.
<i>-Jack, thanks for calling.</i>

698
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:04,566
Uh, and we'll see you when you get back.

699
00:46:13,167 --> 00:46:18,195
I gotta get him a glass of water
so his mouth doesn't go dry
when he reads me my rights.

700
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:25,607
- Here you are, Sergeant.
- Oh, thanks.

701
00:46:36,367 --> 00:46:38,722
Goodbye.

702
00:46:38,807 --> 00:46:41,719
Nice talking to you.
It was very illuminating.

703
00:46:46,407 --> 00:46:48,716
- He heard the phone call.
- We're dead.

704
00:46:48,807 --> 00:46:51,196
- You think Jack's involved in this?
- I don't know.

705
00:46:51,287 --> 00:46:53,596
We gotta talk to Paul Milner.

706
00:46:53,687 --> 00:46:56,076
- Why him?
- Because he is involved.

707
00:46:58,727 --> 00:47:00,797
Couldn't you think of somewhere better
to hide the drugs?

708
00:47:00,887 --> 00:47:03,401
Hey, it was perfect until you insisted
that he hold the baby.

709
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,365
All right, you're right, Michael.
I'm sorry. Where'd you put 'em now?

710
00:47:06,447 --> 00:47:10,156
In the garbage pail
under the other dirty diapers.
Nobody's gonna look for it there.

711
00:47:10,247 --> 00:47:11,965
You realize we're in trouble
with this cop.

712
00:47:12,047 --> 00:47:15,323
You realize, of course, that
no one's coming back to get this kid.

713
00:47:15,407 --> 00:47:18,524
<i>- ...is not in service.</i>
-Jesus, you're right.

714
00:47:18,607 --> 00:47:20,757
We're stuck with her
until Jack gets back.

715
00:47:20,847 --> 00:47:23,884
It's disconnected.

716
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:26,640
- Oh, I'm late.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute, so am I.

717
00:47:26,727 --> 00:47:28,718
Oh, damn it.

718
00:47:28,807 --> 00:47:30,718
Mr Kellam?

719
00:47:31,687 --> 00:47:34,485
Mr Mitchell?

720
00:47:36,367 --> 00:47:39,086
- Hello, Mrs Hathaway.
- Oh, Mr Mitchell.

721
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:43,638
It seems that a horse
has befouled the front walk.
Do you know anything about it?

722
00:47:45,287 --> 00:47:48,962
- Mrs Hathaway, how nice to see you.
- Really nice to see you.

723
00:47:49,047 --> 00:47:51,322
Oh.

724
00:47:51,407 --> 00:47:53,477
- She can sit till 5:00.
- Well, I'll try and hurry.

725
00:47:53,567 --> 00:47:56,684
Me too. I'm worried.

726
00:48:00,087 --> 00:48:03,875
- I got the one with the mustache.
- I'll call Sergeant Melkowitz
and tell him we're moving.

727
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:05,798
Right.

728
00:48:17,607 --> 00:48:19,518
There.

729
00:48:28,847 --> 00:48:30,963
Here you go, pal.
What can I do for ya?

730
00:48:31,047 --> 00:48:35,404
I'd like, uh, <i>Sports Illustrated,</i>
<i>Popular Science,</i> some of this gum...

731
00:48:35,487 --> 00:48:37,876
and that giraffe up there.

732
00:48:37,967 --> 00:48:41,164
- Which one's the giraffe?
- The rubber one.

733
00:48:41,247 --> 00:48:43,841
That's not a giraffe.
That's a dinosaur.

734
00:48:43,927 --> 00:48:47,522
- Whatever.
- You mean the one with
the little polka dots up there?

735
00:48:47,607 --> 00:48:49,996
- Yes, uh, thank you.
- That's a dinosaur.
A giraffe has big ears.

736
00:48:50,087 --> 00:48:53,636
- I don't care whether it has ears
or not.Just give me the damn thing.
- It's got little ears. It's a dinosaur.

737
00:48:55,247 --> 00:48:58,239
- Hey, what about your change?
- Never mind.
- What about your change, pal?

738
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:20,682
He left at 4:00.
He'll be back on Thursday.

739
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:23,918
Mrs Hathaway.
Mrs Hathaway, I'm home.

740
00:49:28,007 --> 00:49:30,646
Mrs Hathaway.
Mrs Hathaway, where's Mary?

741
00:49:30,727 --> 00:49:33,036
- I don't know. I don't know.
- Where's Mary?

742
00:49:35,647 --> 00:49:37,638
Mary?

743
00:49:37,727 --> 00:49:39,445
Oh, my God.

744
00:49:40,807 --> 00:49:43,196
Mary! Mary!

745
00:49:44,727 --> 00:49:46,445
Mary.

746
00:49:49,167 --> 00:49:50,885
Mary!

747
00:49:52,287 --> 00:49:54,005
Mary!

748
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:57,645
Mary!

749
00:50:01,807 --> 00:50:03,525
Mary!

750
00:50:17,327 --> 00:50:19,636
Thank God.

751
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:26,400
Thank God.

752
00:50:26,487 --> 00:50:29,877
No, everything's fine, darling.
Everything's fine.

753
00:50:29,967 --> 00:50:32,276
Don't you worry.

754
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:37,364
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
No. It's okay.

755
00:50:37,447 --> 00:50:40,519
Peter? Peter!

756
00:50:42,407 --> 00:50:44,318
She's okay. She's not hurt.

757
00:50:48,247 --> 00:50:51,080
- How are you?
- I'm fine.Just--

758
00:50:52,367 --> 00:50:55,996
See what those bastards did
to my videotapes?

759
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:58,396
We got a message.

760
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:01,997
What'd it say?

761
00:51:02,087 --> 00:51:04,476
''Next time we'll take the baby.''

762
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:08,480
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Mr Kellam.

763
00:51:09,847 --> 00:51:12,407
Mr Mitchell!

764
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:16,116
''The champ caught Smith
with a savage left hook...

765
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:20,280
''that sent the challenger
crashing into the ropes.

766
00:51:20,367 --> 00:51:27,364
''Smith, his left eye swollen
and the cut above his right eye
now much more bloody...

767
00:51:27,447 --> 00:51:30,883
countered with a barrage
of vicious body blows.''

768
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:35,483
- What are you reading her?
- It doesn't matter what I read.

769
00:51:35,567 --> 00:51:37,922
It's the tone you use.

770
00:51:38,007 --> 00:51:41,363
She doesn't understand the words anyway.
Now, where were we?

771
00:51:41,447 --> 00:51:45,076
''The champ began the fifth round...

772
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:48,045
''like a man possessed...

773
00:51:48,127 --> 00:51:52,200
''going straight for
his opponent's body...

774
00:51:52,287 --> 00:51:54,596
with ferocious energy.''

775
00:52:01,687 --> 00:52:03,996
Here you go, darlin'.

776
00:53:35,247 --> 00:53:37,681
Stupid-- I can't believe--

777
00:53:44,767 --> 00:53:48,442
My face! Watch out for my face!
Peter, it's me,Jack!

778
00:53:48,527 --> 00:53:50,677
-Jack!
-Jesus,Jack!

779
00:53:50,767 --> 00:53:53,918
- Get up!
- No, wait--
- W-What are you-- Get him off!
- You irresponsible-- Come here!

780
00:53:54,007 --> 00:53:57,283
- What is it with you guys?
- We should be asking you that question!

781
00:53:57,367 --> 00:54:00,882
- Why? What'd I do?
- What the hell are you doing
back so soon anyway?

782
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:03,322
- My part got cut. Okay?
- Good!

783
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,796
What is with him? Wh--Je--

784
00:54:05,887 --> 00:54:09,800
Look at this place.
Will somebody please tell me
what the hell is goin' on around here?

785
00:54:11,647 --> 00:54:14,559
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

786
00:54:14,647 --> 00:54:17,798
What was that?
No, I'm not goin' anywhere
until you tell me what's goin' on.

787
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:20,401
- We'll be glad to.
- That really hurt, Peter.

788
00:54:20,487 --> 00:54:24,400
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Sunday morning
I come back from jogging...

789
00:54:24,487 --> 00:54:29,641
to find this basket with this baby in it
waiting in the vestibule.

790
00:54:29,727 --> 00:54:32,924
- Well, why--
- Inside is a little note
from a Sylvia...

791
00:54:33,007 --> 00:54:36,283
saying that the baby was yours
and she was leaving it here
for you to deal with it.

792
00:54:36,367 --> 00:54:40,076
- M-Mine?
- Then along comes another little
package with your name on it...

793
00:54:40,167 --> 00:54:42,840
only this time
the package has heroin in it...

794
00:54:42,927 --> 00:54:46,681
and the narcotics squad permanently
camped downstairs knows all about it.

795
00:54:46,767 --> 00:54:51,283
The cops? I don't believe this.
I don't know anything about any drugs
or any police.

796
00:54:51,367 --> 00:54:55,201
I mean, I thought
I was just doing a favour for Paul.
I didn't know what was in that package.

797
00:54:55,287 --> 00:54:57,198
And I certainly don't know anything
about that baby.

798
00:54:57,287 --> 00:55:03,078
I mean, for God's sake, somebody
drops a baby off on, on your doorstep,
and you automatically assume he's mine?

799
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,806
Look, the child doesn't look
anything like me.

800
00:55:07,327 --> 00:55:10,285
I'm bigger and, and I have more hair.

801
00:55:10,367 --> 00:55:15,077
''Dear Jack, Here is our baby.
I can't handle this now.
I don't know where else to turn. S--''

802
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:19,404
Sylvia? Oh, my--

803
00:55:19,487 --> 00:55:23,036
Oh, my God. Stratford.
Ayear and a ha--

804
00:55:23,127 --> 00:55:26,199
Ayear and a half ago.

805
00:55:26,287 --> 00:55:28,881
I was doing <i>Taming of the Shrew.</i>
She was the shrew.

806
00:55:28,967 --> 00:55:32,357
I mean, I did some of
my best work in that.

807
00:55:32,447 --> 00:55:35,723
- I got great reviews.
-Jack, you're such a jerk.

808
00:55:35,807 --> 00:55:40,198
- You're always thinkin' about yourself.
I wanna kill you.
- Michael, you won't have to.

809
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:45,315
Jack, I would like to introduce you
to your daughter Mary.

810
00:55:48,607 --> 00:55:53,522
Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute,
you guys. You can't be sure
that this is my kid. Uh-- Um--

811
00:55:53,607 --> 00:55:59,125
- What the hell am I
supposed to do with it?
- We've put our lives on hold,Jack,
taking care of this kid...

812
00:55:59,207 --> 00:56:02,404
and now it's your turn.

813
00:56:04,087 --> 00:56:06,476
Okay. All right. All right, fine.

814
00:56:07,567 --> 00:56:12,163
All right, until I straighten this mess
out, I'll, uh, I'll take care of her.

815
00:56:12,247 --> 00:56:14,841
I mean, sure, why not?

816
00:56:14,927 --> 00:56:17,839
I'm an actor.
I can, uh, I can do a father.

817
00:56:19,127 --> 00:56:23,678
Yeah. Yeah. See, huh?
What could be so difficult, huh? Yeah.

818
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:27,203
- Goodnight,Jack.
- Goodnight,Jack.
- Goodnight. Goodnight.

819
00:56:27,287 --> 00:56:30,165
Oh. Down we go.

820
00:56:30,247 --> 00:56:32,761
W-W-Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What-What's the matter with her?

821
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:35,486
- Goodnight,Jack.
- Goodnight,Jack.

822
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:45,479
Hold still, kid. Gee-- Hey, how do you
put on these goddam things anyway?

823
00:56:45,566 --> 00:56:48,683
Figure it out for yourself,
dickhead.

824
00:56:48,766 --> 00:56:50,996
- Nice shot.
- Look at that stuff. Oh, my God!

825
00:56:51,086 --> 00:56:53,475
What are you guys feeding her, huh?
Oh, no, no, please!

826
00:56:53,566 --> 00:56:56,478
Not on the silk sheets.
Not on the silk sheets. Please, please!

827
00:56:56,566 --> 00:56:59,319
Maybe I should show him
how to put on the diaper.

828
00:56:59,406 --> 00:57:03,797
Oh, no. I don't believe this.
Why me? Oh, come on, baby.

829
00:57:03,886 --> 00:57:07,640
Nope. Let's give him
another half hour.

830
00:57:07,726 --> 00:57:10,035
Let him suffer.

831
00:57:11,966 --> 00:57:15,083
Yes, yes, I'm trying
to reach Paul Milner.

832
00:57:15,166 --> 00:57:17,919
No, he was supposed to be
in San Francisco, but I can't find him.

833
00:57:18,006 --> 00:57:22,636
Wo-Would you please tell him to call
Jack Holden as soon as he gets in?

834
00:57:22,726 --> 00:57:25,957
<i>- Is this urgent?</i>
- Yeah, urgent's an understatement.

835
00:57:27,046 --> 00:57:29,355
Lady.

836
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:34,283
I don't know why I bother giving you
this. It just goes right through you.

837
00:57:34,366 --> 00:57:36,561
- Did you get a hold of your friend?
- No.

838
00:57:36,646 --> 00:57:39,444
- Don't forget to bolt the door.
- I won't.

839
00:57:39,526 --> 00:57:42,962
And remember, there's
a quarter of a million dollars
in heroin in that diaper pail.

840
00:57:43,046 --> 00:57:45,480
- And the new baby wipes
are in the cabinet.
- Right.

841
00:57:45,566 --> 00:57:48,797
Heroin's in the diaper pail.
Baby wipes are in the cabinet.

842
00:57:48,886 --> 00:57:51,958
Where else would they be?
I can't believe this.

843
00:57:52,046 --> 00:57:56,164
You're kidding me. Thirty-two
Benningtons i-in the London area?

844
00:57:56,246 --> 00:57:59,079
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

845
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:02,681
Uh, uh, uh, I'll get back to you.
I-I--

846
00:58:03,766 --> 00:58:06,075
Oh, boy.

847
00:58:06,166 --> 00:58:09,795
Oh, baby. Look, I-I know.
I know. I know. Yes.

848
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:12,195
Yes, yes, yes.

849
00:58:16,646 --> 00:58:19,763
Oh, God. Y-Yeah.

850
00:58:19,846 --> 00:58:22,644
Well, we tried your mommy.
Maybe I should, uh--

851
00:58:22,726 --> 00:58:25,638
Maybe I should try mine, huh?

852
00:58:29,486 --> 00:58:31,795
Yeah.

853
00:58:34,006 --> 00:58:36,156
Mom?

854
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:39,044
- Well, where is she?
- Oh, Mom, wait till you see her.

855
00:58:39,126 --> 00:58:42,084
Oh, you won't believe this.
She is so beautiful.

856
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:44,396
She looks just like you.

857
00:58:44,486 --> 00:58:47,637
- You know, you boys live like pigs.
- Oh, Mom.

858
00:58:47,726 --> 00:58:49,637
Look, look. There.
Isn't she beautiful?

859
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:53,401
There she is.
Look at that little baby!

860
00:58:53,486 --> 00:58:55,158
- Yeah.
- You're such a pretty little girl.

861
00:58:55,246 --> 00:58:57,282
Will you come to me?
I'm gonna pick you right up.

862
00:58:57,366 --> 00:59:00,039
- Yes, I'm gonna pick you right up.
- Oh, I am in awe. I mean, look at you.

863
00:59:00,126 --> 00:59:02,082
You-You pick her up like a pro.

864
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:04,600
I pick her up like a grandmother.

865
00:59:04,686 --> 00:59:07,075
It's called experience.
Darling.

866
00:59:07,166 --> 00:59:10,476
Let's see you. Oh, she's so lovely.
What's her name?

867
00:59:10,566 --> 00:59:13,034
- Mary.
- Mary.

868
00:59:13,126 --> 00:59:16,277
Well, Mary!

869
00:59:16,366 --> 00:59:18,880
Look at the way
she's looking at me.

870
00:59:20,126 --> 00:59:24,677
-For a moment there, I had her laughing.
-Yeah, just like me, huh?

871
00:59:24,766 --> 00:59:27,439
Don't ruin this for me,Jack.

872
00:59:27,526 --> 00:59:29,881
- Oh!
- Oh, she adores you!

873
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:32,764
- You-- Well, well, well.
- She knows that you're her grandmother.

874
00:59:32,846 --> 00:59:35,883
It's like a-- It's like a biological
thing, an instant connection.

875
00:59:35,966 --> 00:59:38,685
Cut the crap,Jack.
What do you want?

876
00:59:40,206 --> 00:59:43,482
Mom, I can't take care of her.

877
00:59:43,566 --> 00:59:45,477
I don't know what to do.

878
00:59:45,566 --> 00:59:48,034
I was kinda hoping that-- that maybe you
could take her, just for a little while.

879
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,594
Not forever. You know,
until she's ready to vote.

880
00:59:50,686 --> 00:59:55,601
Oh, I would love to.
Do you know,Jack?

881
00:59:55,686 --> 00:59:59,042
Some people live all their lives...

882
00:59:59,126 --> 01:00:02,277
without having anything as wonderful
as this to show for it?

883
01:00:02,366 --> 01:00:06,882
- I know, Mom.
- So I'm gonna do the most wonderful
thing in the world for you.

884
01:00:06,966 --> 01:00:10,163
Absolutely nothing.

885
01:00:10,246 --> 01:00:12,635
Why?

886
01:00:12,726 --> 01:00:15,479
Jack, you've always run away
from responsibility.

887
01:00:15,566 --> 01:00:18,797
Now you have to turn and face it.

888
01:00:20,806 --> 01:00:24,321
Mom, I'm a screw-up.

889
01:00:24,406 --> 01:00:27,159
You were a screw-up.
Now you're a father.

890
01:00:28,446 --> 01:00:31,085
And you'll be a fine one.

891
01:00:32,406 --> 01:00:34,681
- You think so?
- I know it.

892
01:00:38,726 --> 01:00:41,479
Your father, God rest his soul...

893
01:00:41,566 --> 01:00:44,683
he was a screw-up
and he turned out just fine.

894
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:47,280
- Really?
- Don't you remember?

895
01:00:47,366 --> 01:00:50,563
- Well, yeah, I guess.
- Now, give me a kiss.

896
01:00:52,246 --> 01:00:54,476
Mary, give me a kiss.

897
01:00:55,846 --> 01:01:00,362
And now, you and your friends
clean this place up.

898
01:01:00,446 --> 01:01:03,961
If not for yourselves,
do it for my granddaughter.

899
01:01:04,046 --> 01:01:06,276
- We-We will. We will.
- Bye.

900
01:01:06,366 --> 01:01:08,675
Bye. Thanks anyway, Mom.

901
01:01:10,566 --> 01:01:14,479
Well, looks like it's just
you and me now, kid.

902
01:01:14,566 --> 01:01:16,841
What? Mama.

903
01:01:19,006 --> 01:01:22,078
Oh,Jack? There's four bottles
prepared already.

904
01:01:22,166 --> 01:01:24,077
So you should be fine
till tomorrow morning.

905
01:01:24,166 --> 01:01:26,157
And if her bottom gets red,
you just give her a bottle of water.

906
01:01:26,246 --> 01:01:28,601
Works miracles.
In about three hours, white as marble.

907
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:30,677
We'll be in seats D-1 1 ,
1 2, 1 3 and 1 4.

908
01:01:30,766 --> 01:01:34,076
Yeah, if there's a problem, just call.
The usher will come and get us. Oh!

909
01:01:34,166 --> 01:01:36,475
Here's the number.

910
01:01:38,326 --> 01:01:40,886
- Wait a minute.
Are you leaving right now?
- Yeah, now.

911
01:01:40,966 --> 01:01:43,161
- When are you coming back?
- About midnight.

912
01:01:43,246 --> 01:01:45,885
All right. Don't worry about us.
Wait a minute. Is this a four?

913
01:01:45,966 --> 01:01:48,275
Yeah, it's a four.

914
01:01:51,006 --> 01:01:53,315
It's good to have.

915
01:01:54,966 --> 01:01:56,957
So, uh, what do you want to do?

916
01:02:04,646 --> 01:02:07,479
You know, this show's been running
longer than Mary's been alive?

917
01:02:07,566 --> 01:02:10,160
Peter, we agreed not to mention
her name tonight, right?

918
01:02:10,246 --> 01:02:13,158
- Right. My mistake.
- Who did you guys con
into sitting for you?

919
01:02:13,246 --> 01:02:16,238
-Jack.
-Jack? Daddy?

920
01:02:20,326 --> 01:02:22,635
Patty.

921
01:02:27,766 --> 01:02:31,156
Are you hungry? Huh?
Well, we're in luck here.

922
01:02:31,246 --> 01:02:33,157
Uh, oh-ho-ho!

923
01:02:33,246 --> 01:02:35,635
Tonight, uh, the chef has, uh...

924
01:02:35,726 --> 01:02:37,842
cooked up something
very special for you.

925
01:02:37,926 --> 01:02:40,486
He has taken the juice
of one cow...

926
01:02:40,566 --> 01:02:43,797
and, uh, sauteed it,
uh, with a fine sauce.

927
01:02:43,886 --> 01:02:47,276
It is, uh, presented
surrounded by a bottle...

928
01:02:47,366 --> 01:02:51,405
and topped off, uh, with
a delicious rubber nipple, huh?

929
01:02:51,486 --> 01:02:54,478
Oh-ho. Yes.
Oh, excellent choice. Yes, yes.

930
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:57,876
Here we go. Oh, yes.

931
01:02:59,246 --> 01:03:01,555
Wh-What?

932
01:03:02,646 --> 01:03:05,080
Here you go. Come on.

933
01:03:06,966 --> 01:03:09,275
Please?

934
01:03:10,886 --> 01:03:13,354
You don't want it, huh?

935
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:20,555
Yeah, I just changed you. Huh?

936
01:03:20,646 --> 01:03:24,161
And you're not hungry.
What else is there in life?

937
01:03:30,886 --> 01:03:33,354
I always wanted to be
a musical comedy star.

938
01:03:33,446 --> 01:03:35,198
- Did you ever try?
- No.

939
01:03:39,806 --> 01:03:43,958
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>act two will begin in three minutes.</i>

940
01:03:44,046 --> 01:03:46,640
<i>Three minutes.</i>

941
01:03:46,726 --> 01:03:49,081
Michael, have you
ever done any acting?

942
01:03:49,166 --> 01:03:52,636
No. No, I leave that to Jack.
The idiot.

943
01:03:57,646 --> 01:04:01,036
<i>I got sunshine on a cloudy day</i>

944
01:04:01,126 --> 01:04:05,244
<i>When it's cold outside</i>
<i>I've got the month of May</i>

945
01:04:05,326 --> 01:04:09,080
<i>I guess you say</i>

946
01:04:09,166 --> 01:04:13,762
<i>What can make me feel this way</i>
<i>My girl</i>

947
01:04:13,846 --> 01:04:16,519
But maybe he fell asleep.
Maybe he fell and hit his head.

948
01:04:16,606 --> 01:04:19,279
He's probably unconscious.

949
01:04:19,366 --> 01:04:21,675
- Will you come on? It's started.
- It's terrible, terrible.

950
01:04:21,766 --> 01:04:23,438
- I had a great time.
- I'll see you at P.J.'s later.

951
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:26,245
Oh, you can sing us a song
from the second act, okay?

952
01:04:26,326 --> 01:04:28,476
Are they always this strange?

953
01:04:28,566 --> 01:04:32,559
Yes, since they got involved
with another woman.

954
01:04:34,246 --> 01:04:37,397
Wasn't that fun, huh? Yeah.
Oh, cover that.

955
01:04:37,486 --> 01:04:39,841
-Jack?
-Jack, where are you?

956
01:04:39,926 --> 01:04:43,282
-Jack!
- I'm right here. What? What?

957
01:04:43,366 --> 01:04:46,995
- What are you doing?
- Well, what's it look
like I'm doing, Peter?

958
01:04:47,086 --> 01:04:49,964
- Is everything all right?
- Everything's fine, yeah.

959
01:04:50,046 --> 01:04:52,401
Why you guys back so soon
anyway, huh?

960
01:04:52,486 --> 01:04:55,558
Uh, we thought that we might
have left the stove on.

961
01:04:55,646 --> 01:04:57,557
No, no. The stove's not on.

962
01:04:57,646 --> 01:05:01,480
I think that Uncle Peter
and Uncle Michael are having
a nervous breakdown, yes.

963
01:05:01,566 --> 01:05:06,481
I called,Jack.
I let the phone ring for five minutes.

964
01:05:06,566 --> 01:05:10,878
- Why didn't you answer the phone?
- Well, because Mary and I
were taking a shower.

965
01:05:10,966 --> 01:05:13,036
Weren't we?
Yeah, we didn't hear anything.

966
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:17,404
Yeah. Yeah.
Isn't that the truth, mademoiselle?

967
01:05:17,486 --> 01:05:18,999
Yes.

968
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:23,645
Oh, you are cute, yes.

969
01:05:24,286 --> 01:05:26,846
I never put a phone
in a shower before.

970
01:05:26,926 --> 01:05:29,679
- You get many calls in here?
- A steady stream.

971
01:05:31,686 --> 01:05:35,281
- What if you slipped down there?
- Well, I did try.

972
01:05:37,766 --> 01:05:40,758
- We did pretty well
for the first time out.
- Yeah.

973
01:05:45,126 --> 01:05:47,435
- Here.
- What?

974
01:05:50,566 --> 01:05:52,796
''Commercial director hospitalized
after mugging.''

975
01:05:52,886 --> 01:05:55,878
- What?
- Yeah, take a look at this.
This is your friend, Paul Milner.

976
01:05:55,966 --> 01:05:57,877
''Don't let this happen to you.

977
01:05:57,966 --> 01:06:00,275
''Be at the phone booth at the corner
of 81 st and Columbus...

978
01:06:00,366 --> 01:06:02,277
at exactly 8:00 p.m. tonight.''

979
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:06,236
They're trying to intimidate us.
I hate that.

980
01:06:06,326 --> 01:06:09,682
- I've had enough of this doo-doo.
- I want to finish this, okay?

981
01:06:22,126 --> 01:06:24,401
Hello?

982
01:06:24,486 --> 01:06:27,364
Yeah, we got your message.

983
01:06:27,446 --> 01:06:29,880
Uh-uh. No good.

984
01:06:29,966 --> 01:06:32,161
We do it our way.

985
01:06:32,246 --> 01:06:36,603
Because we got the stuff,
and if you don't do it our way--

986
01:06:36,686 --> 01:06:39,996
- Come on.
- Say it, say it.

987
01:06:41,686 --> 01:06:44,075
We flush it down the toilet!

988
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:47,397
Okay, now listen, and listen good.

989
01:06:47,486 --> 01:06:49,556
There's a-- a construction site.

990
01:07:34,846 --> 01:07:38,282
Car 20 following suspects,
southbound Central Park West.

991
01:07:53,766 --> 01:07:56,405
Come on, Peter!

992
01:08:03,406 --> 01:08:06,762
- Damn it,Joe! We lost 'em!
- I got it. Three blocks, turn around.

993
01:08:08,046 --> 01:08:11,641
That was great. That was great.
Everybody remember what they're
supposed to do?

994
01:08:11,726 --> 01:08:13,637
Oh, come on, Peter.
It's not that complicated a plan.

995
01:08:13,726 --> 01:08:15,842
Yeah, next he's gonna want us
to synchronize our watches, right?

996
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:18,679
Should we do that?

997
01:08:34,766 --> 01:08:36,836
Yes, thank you.

998
01:08:36,926 --> 01:08:40,236
Hello, Sergeant Melkowitz.
Uh, my name is Jack Holden.

999
01:08:40,326 --> 01:08:42,237
I think you know my two roommates.

1000
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:45,398
I must have been crazy
to agree to this. Goddam.

1001
01:08:46,966 --> 01:08:49,685
- Orange elevator. Here it is.
- Right.

1002
01:09:00,486 --> 01:09:03,080
Close door.

1003
01:09:06,966 --> 01:09:08,877
- Okay, 1 5, please.
- Fifteen?

1004
01:09:08,966 --> 01:09:12,117
Yeah. I'm all filthy
and everything.

1005
01:09:30,646 --> 01:09:34,685
What's wrong, my sweetheart?
Come here. What is it, huh?

1006
01:09:34,766 --> 01:09:37,075
Sweetie.

1007
01:09:38,766 --> 01:09:42,759
Oh. Well, you should have
told me before we left.

1008
01:09:44,726 --> 01:09:48,321
Oh, boy, this is not a--
this is not a good time to do this.

1009
01:09:48,406 --> 01:09:50,397
Hold still.

1010
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:52,954
Oh, you make such a--
There you go.

1011
01:09:55,206 --> 01:09:57,242
Michael.

1012
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,635
They're here.

1013
01:10:01,086 --> 01:10:03,281
- Hey, look. Hey, you know,
this is really aggravating.
- I'm here.

1014
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:05,960
- I'm here by the pipes.
- You know, I don't have
a lot of time, but, uh--

1015
01:10:06,046 --> 01:10:08,640
- Hold it.
- What, what, what?
- Hold it! All right, just hold it.

1016
01:10:08,726 --> 01:10:11,684
Look, where is the stuff?
Will you give it to me?

1017
01:10:11,766 --> 01:10:13,836
- It's in the elevator.
- Oh, bullshit.

1018
01:10:13,926 --> 01:10:16,838
Uh, i-it's in the control panel.
Uh, check for yourself.

1019
01:10:16,926 --> 01:10:19,724
What am I supposed to do,
bring my handy little tool kit here?

1020
01:10:19,806 --> 01:10:22,400
You realize that, uh...

1021
01:10:22,486 --> 01:10:25,080
we had absolutely nothing
to do with this.

1022
01:10:25,166 --> 01:10:27,885
We had no idea
what was in the package.

1023
01:10:27,966 --> 01:10:30,764
Yeah, no kidding. I mean, I could have
figured that out in about four seconds.

1024
01:10:30,846 --> 01:10:33,804
I mean, you know, you guys
don't behave like a couple of pros.

1025
01:10:33,886 --> 01:10:36,275
- You know what I mean?
- Right.
- Yeah.

1026
01:10:36,366 --> 01:10:38,675
- We're not pros.
- I just said that, didn't I?

1027
01:10:38,766 --> 01:10:40,757
I'm sensitive to that.

1028
01:10:40,846 --> 01:10:43,076
I mean, why do you make it
so complicated?

1029
01:10:44,166 --> 01:10:47,681
- We've never done this.
- I got it.
- Great.

1030
01:10:47,766 --> 01:10:51,122
You're forgiven this time.

1031
01:10:51,206 --> 01:10:53,674
Very wise of you to cooperate,
finally.

1032
01:10:53,766 --> 01:10:57,156
- Glad it's over.
- No-No happier than I am, believe me.

1033
01:10:57,246 --> 01:11:00,955
I mean, dealing with, uh, amateurs
is a real pain in the ass.

1034
01:11:01,046 --> 01:11:03,685
- So is dealing with professionals.
- No doubt.

1035
01:11:07,126 --> 01:11:10,084
Hey, what is that?

1036
01:11:10,166 --> 01:11:13,522
- What, are you abusing
my trust here or what?
- Whoa!

1037
01:11:13,606 --> 01:11:15,517
- There's someone in there!
- Come on.

1038
01:11:20,566 --> 01:11:22,204
Come on, Michael.

1039
01:11:22,286 --> 01:11:24,436
- Oh, no.
- Oh, look-- look out.

1040
01:11:33,086 --> 01:11:34,963
- I lost my balance.
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1041
01:11:35,046 --> 01:11:38,322
- Did you get it?
- Yeah. Yeah, I got it!
- We got 'em!

1042
01:11:48,726 --> 01:11:52,036
Who's doing this? Huh?
I want that camera, punk!

1043
01:11:55,246 --> 01:11:59,478
- There's six switches!
- Aw, these guys wrecked my day.

1044
01:12:05,886 --> 01:12:07,797
-Jack!
- What the hell happened?

1045
01:12:07,886 --> 01:12:11,356
- He hit the wrong button.
- He what?

1046
01:12:11,446 --> 01:12:13,596
- Can it go any faster or what?
- This is it.

1047
01:12:13,686 --> 01:12:18,635
- Huh? Come on. You punks!
-Jack!

1048
01:12:18,726 --> 01:12:22,480
-Jack!
- Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.

1049
01:12:22,566 --> 01:12:26,400
I want that home movie.
I'll wait for you. I want that movie.

1050
01:12:27,566 --> 01:12:31,479
- Oh, no.
-Jack!

1051
01:12:31,566 --> 01:12:35,081
- Hit the button on the left!
- The button on the left,Jack!

1052
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:38,602
- What? What?
- Hit the button on the left!

1053
01:12:38,686 --> 01:12:41,280
There is no left. The le--

1054
01:12:42,846 --> 01:12:45,360
- Come on, get it going faster,
will ya? Is that it?
- I can't.

1055
01:12:46,726 --> 01:12:49,399
Please.

1056
01:12:49,486 --> 01:12:51,795
- Hey, why are we stopped?
What's the matter? Huh?
- I don't understand.

1057
01:12:51,886 --> 01:12:53,365
- Why is this elevator stopped?
- What do you want? It's dead.
The whole thing's no good.

1058
01:12:53,446 --> 01:12:55,880
I got 'em!

1059
01:12:55,966 --> 01:12:58,036
- It ain't running.
It just ain't running.
- What's going on?

1060
01:12:58,126 --> 01:13:01,482
- Did you hit the button? Jesus.
- Yeah, it's dead.
- Oh, boy.

1061
01:13:01,566 --> 01:13:04,922
Uncle Peter and Uncle Michael are
gonna be plenty ticked off with Daddy.

1062
01:13:09,646 --> 01:13:12,797
- Aren't you glad he's on our side?
- What happened? What happened?
Can you get--

1063
01:13:12,886 --> 01:13:14,922
You wait for me.
I know where you live, man!

1064
01:13:35,246 --> 01:13:38,682
- Oh, no, no, Vince.
- Oh, why? Why is this happening?

1065
01:13:38,766 --> 01:13:41,917
- Oh, no!
- Why is this happening? Why?

1066
01:13:42,006 --> 01:13:43,917
Okay. It's okay, guys. It's okay.

1067
01:13:46,486 --> 01:13:49,842
Hi. Um, are you Sergeant Melkowitz?

1068
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:52,394
- Yeah.
- Oh, good.

1069
01:13:52,486 --> 01:13:55,284
- Are you-- Are you the father?
- Yes. Yes, yes, I am.

1070
01:13:55,366 --> 01:13:57,755
Hey! Oh, thanks for the phone call.

1071
01:13:57,846 --> 01:14:00,155
Oh, actually it was, uh,
Peter's idea. Hi, guys.

1072
01:14:00,246 --> 01:14:02,157
- She's okay, she's okay.
- Hello, Sergeant.

1073
01:14:02,246 --> 01:14:05,477
-The guys you want are in that elevator.
-The drugs are up there too.

1074
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:08,558
- Everything you need
to know is right here.
- It's very illuminating.

1075
01:14:08,646 --> 01:14:10,637
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

1076
01:14:10,726 --> 01:14:12,398
If I have any questions,
I know where to reach you guys.

1077
01:14:12,486 --> 01:14:14,397
- Yeah.
- Okay, fellas.
- Let's get 'em,Jimmy.

1078
01:14:14,486 --> 01:14:17,284
- Hey, can I hold the baby, huh?
- No.

1079
01:14:17,366 --> 01:14:20,438
- No.
- Oh, I guess not.

1080
01:14:23,446 --> 01:14:27,200
<i>When the sun goes down</i>
<i>and it's getting late</i>

1081
01:14:27,286 --> 01:14:30,278
<i>You say it's time for bed</i>

1082

1083

<i>Heard a word you said</i>

1084
01:14:41,046 --> 01:14:45,164
<i>Little baby</i>
<i>want to hold you tight</i>

1085
01:14:45,246 --> 01:14:49,444
<i>She don't ever wanna</i>
<i>say goodnight</i>

1086
01:14:49,526 --> 01:14:54,520
<i>She's in love</i>
<i>She want to be Daddy's girl</i>

1087
01:14:56,886 --> 01:15:00,959
<i>When the morning comes</i>
<i>and it's time to go</i>

1088
01:15:01,046 --> 01:15:03,355
<i>Start another day</i>

1089
01:15:05,246 --> 01:15:09,842
<i>She won't let you leave</i>
<i>and she does her best</i>

1090
01:15:09,926 --> 01:15:12,360
<i>Try to make you stay</i>

1091
01:15:14,726 --> 01:15:18,799
<i>Pretty baby</i>
<i>gonna start to cry</i>

1092
01:15:18,886 --> 01:15:22,674
<i>She don't ever wanna</i>
<i>say goodbye</i>

1093
01:15:22,766 --> 01:15:28,204
<i>She's in love</i>
<i>She want to be Daddy's girl</i>

1094
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:35,677
<i>She don't ever wanna be</i>
<i>without you</i>

1095
01:15:35,766 --> 01:15:39,884
<i>Never have to worry</i>
<i>She won't doubt you</i>

1096
01:15:39,966 --> 01:15:43,959
<i>Then she puts her head</i>
<i>upon your shoulder</i>

1097
01:15:44,046 --> 01:15:48,358
<i>- Says she'll marry you</i>
<i>when she gets older</i>
- Go again, please.

1098
01:15:49,446 --> 01:15:52,643
- I will see you burn in hell.
- You'll see me where?

1099
01:15:52,726 --> 01:15:55,684
- In hell. You heard me.
- Yes, and where will you be...

1100
01:15:55,766 --> 01:15:57,757
while I'm burning in hell?

1101
01:15:57,846 --> 01:16:01,122
I'll tell you where I'll be,
you silly bitch.

1102
01:16:01,206 --> 01:16:04,278
I will be in Niagara Falls,
that's where.

1103
01:16:06,406 --> 01:16:09,079
Can you say ''Michael''?
Michael.

1104
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:13,159
Huh? Yeah.
Can you say ''Michael''?

1105
01:16:13,246 --> 01:16:16,397
Michael. Michael.

1106
01:16:16,486 --> 01:16:20,957
<i>She won't understand</i>
<i>why you're feeling sad</i>

1107
01:16:21,046 --> 01:16:26,040
<i>'Cause she's leaving you alone</i>

1108
01:16:26,126 --> 01:16:30,244
<i>Little woman gonna make you cry</i>

1109
01:16:30,326 --> 01:16:34,478
<i>You don't ever</i>
<i>wanna say goodbye</i>

1110
01:16:34,566 --> 01:16:40,277
<i>She's a lady</i>
<i>She'll always be Daddy's girl</i>

1111
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:47,039
<i>Little woman</i>
<i>gonna break your heart</i>

1112
01:16:47,126 --> 01:16:49,082
<i>- She's a lady</i>
- One bottle, please. One bottle.

1113
01:16:49,166 --> 01:16:51,634
<i>- She'll always be Daddy's girl</i>
- Bottle.

1114
01:16:51,726 --> 01:16:56,641
- Bottle, please. Bottle. Here it comes.
<i>-Always be Daddy's girl</i>

1115
01:16:56,726 --> 01:17:00,082
<i>She'll always be Daddy's girl</i>

1116
01:17:12,966 --> 01:17:17,357
Shh. I know, I know, I know, I know.
I know, I know. Yes, yes, yes.

1117
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:27,357
- What's the matter?
- I don't know. She just-- She doesn't
seem to want to stop crying.

1118
01:17:27,446 --> 01:17:29,641
That's not like her.

1119
01:17:29,726 --> 01:17:32,160
- Well?
- Let's give it a try.

1120
01:17:32,246 --> 01:17:35,283
Really? All right. I'll, uh--

1121
01:17:37,966 --> 01:17:42,084
<i>Goodnight, sweetheart</i>
<i>Well, it's time to go</i>

1122
01:17:43,766 --> 01:17:48,282
<i>Goodnight, sweetheart</i>
<i>Well, it's time to go</i>

1123
01:17:49,646 --> 01:17:54,481
<i>I hate to leave you</i>
<i>but I really must say</i>

1124
01:17:54,566 --> 01:17:58,195
<i>Goodnight, sweetheart</i>
<i>Goodnight</i>

1125
01:17:59,286 --> 01:18:02,039
<i>Well, it's 3.</i>:<i>00</i>

1126
01:18:02,126 --> 01:18:04,560
<i>In the morning</i>

1127
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:08,878
<i>Baby, I just can't treat you right</i>

1128
01:18:08,966 --> 01:18:11,958
<i>Well, I hate to leave you, baby</i>

1129
01:18:12,046 --> 01:18:14,560
<i>I don't mean maybe</i>

1130
01:18:14,646 --> 01:18:17,558
<i>Because I love you so</i>

1131
01:18:20,366 --> 01:18:23,756
<i>Goodnight, sweetheart</i>
<i>Well, it's time to go</i>

1132
01:18:25,166 --> 01:18:29,842
<i>Goodnight, sweetheart</i>
<i>Well, it's time to go</i>

1133
01:18:29,926 --> 01:18:34,283
<i>I hate to leave you</i>
<i>but I really must say</i>

1134
01:18:34,366 --> 01:18:38,598
<i>Goodnight, sweetheart</i>
<i>Goodnight</i>

1135
01:18:48,366 --> 01:18:50,880
I didn't know you sang so well.

1136
01:18:50,966 --> 01:18:53,275
Well, you know, it, uh,
kind of helps her sleep.

1137
01:18:56,246 --> 01:19:00,034
This is having quite an effect on you.
You gonna have any more kids?

1138
01:19:00,126 --> 01:19:02,845
I don't want to talk about it,
Rebecca. Goodnight.

1139
01:19:10,566 --> 01:19:13,364
Peter, I'm having
a lot of trouble sleeping.

1140
01:19:13,446 --> 01:19:16,085
Could you sing to me, please?

1141
01:19:30,086 --> 01:19:32,884
All right, so, uh--

1142
01:19:32,966 --> 01:19:35,480
Thank you. Thank you.

1143
01:19:35,566 --> 01:19:37,875
Great.

1144
01:19:39,966 --> 01:19:42,480
- Good morning.
- Hello.

1145
01:19:48,246 --> 01:19:50,555
There you go.

1146
01:19:55,566 --> 01:19:58,319
Yes?

1147
01:19:58,406 --> 01:20:00,715
I'm Sylvia.

1148
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:03,917
Mary's mother.
I've come to get her.

1149
01:20:08,646 --> 01:20:11,285
-Just a minute.
- How is she doing?

1150
01:20:13,966 --> 01:20:18,676
She's fine. She's teething.
That can be rough.

1151
01:20:21,766 --> 01:20:25,441
- Can I see her?
- Yeah, sure. Come on in.

1152
01:20:39,726 --> 01:20:43,878
I don't believe
how wonderful she looks!

1153
01:20:43,966 --> 01:20:46,878
Oh! Hello, Mary.

1154
01:20:46,966 --> 01:20:49,116
Hello, my darling.

1155
01:20:49,206 --> 01:20:53,404
It's your mommy.
Yes, it's your mommy.

1156
01:20:53,486 --> 01:20:57,445
You're very beautiful.
Your hair is growing.

1157
01:20:57,526 --> 01:21:00,165
You've changed so much,
and I've missed it.

1158
01:21:00,246 --> 01:21:02,714
Mommy has missed you.

1159
01:21:02,806 --> 01:21:06,401
Oh, I never thought
I'd miss her this much.

1160
01:21:06,486 --> 01:21:08,954
Hello!

1161
01:21:09,046 --> 01:21:11,765
Hello!

1162
01:21:11,846 --> 01:21:14,804
Where's my baby?
Is Jack here?

1163
01:21:16,646 --> 01:21:20,844
- I'll get him.
- Mary, look how big you've gotten!

1164
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:27,041
Michael. Michael.

1165
01:21:29,646 --> 01:21:32,160
Sylvia's here.

1166
01:21:32,246 --> 01:21:34,555
Mary's leaving.

1167
01:21:56,646 --> 01:21:59,160
She looks very happy,Jack.

1168
01:21:59,246 --> 01:22:02,363
You've obviously taken
good care of her.

1169
01:22:04,366 --> 01:22:06,880
I'm sorry.

1170
01:22:06,966 --> 01:22:10,754
I shouldn't have left her
the way I did.

1171
01:22:10,846 --> 01:22:13,280
I hope it didn't cause
too much trouble.

1172
01:22:15,046 --> 01:22:17,685
Uh, no, no. No trouble at all.

1173
01:22:21,046 --> 01:22:23,799
Sylvia.

1174
01:22:23,886 --> 01:22:26,400
There's something I need to know.

1175
01:22:26,486 --> 01:22:28,795
Is she really mine?

1176
01:22:30,646 --> 01:22:32,955
Yes. She is.

1177
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:43,364
So, uh, what are you gonna do now?
Do you-- Do you have any idea?

1178
01:22:43,446 --> 01:22:45,880
I, um--

1179
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:47,877
I'm going home.

1180
01:22:47,966 --> 01:22:50,764
I can't work and take care
of Mary on my own...

1181
01:22:50,846 --> 01:22:53,565
so, um...

1182
01:22:53,646 --> 01:22:56,365
we're going to move in
with my family.

1183
01:22:56,446 --> 01:22:58,755
They said they'd help.

1184
01:23:00,566 --> 01:23:02,875
You're going to London?

1185
01:23:05,206 --> 01:23:07,515
Yeah.

1186
01:23:17,646 --> 01:23:20,160
When?

1187
01:23:20,246 --> 01:23:22,555
Tonight.

1188
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:28,636
- Is that what you really want to do?
- Sorry?

1189
01:23:28,726 --> 01:23:31,035
Never mind.

1190
01:23:34,646 --> 01:23:38,400
- You pack all the bottles?
- Yeah.

1191
01:23:38,486 --> 01:23:40,954
And cans of formula?

1192
01:23:41,046 --> 01:23:43,480
- You packed 'em.
- Yeah.

1193
01:23:45,646 --> 01:23:49,434
What about the blender?
Maybe we should give her that,
to mash up bananas and stuff.

1194
01:23:49,526 --> 01:23:52,086
Sure.

1195
01:23:52,166 --> 01:23:55,681
And diapers?
You pack extra Pampers?

1196
01:23:55,766 --> 01:23:58,075
Yeah.

1197
01:23:59,646 --> 01:24:03,355
How can he let her go?
If I were Jack, I would not let her go.

1198
01:24:03,446 --> 01:24:06,882
Neither would I, Michael.
Neither would I.

1199
01:24:06,966 --> 01:24:10,356
But he's the father.

1200
01:24:10,446 --> 01:24:12,676
I don't think he wants her to go...

1201
01:24:12,766 --> 01:24:15,075
but he just can't admit it.

1202
01:24:19,646 --> 01:24:22,683
You know, if you want anything,
anything at all, you call us, okay?

1203
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:26,554
She'll probably be hungry in an hour.
She's a real good eater, so, uh--

1204
01:24:26,646 --> 01:24:29,558
- Like her daddy.
- Some of this stuff's fragile in here.

1205
01:24:29,646 --> 01:24:32,399
- Okay, I got it.
- You know, if she-- if she wakes up
in the middle of the night...

1206
01:24:32,486 --> 01:24:34,397
she likes to be sung to.

1207
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,556
'50s and '60s music works best.

1208
01:24:36,646 --> 01:24:40,400
- Thanks. I'll remember that.
- You're all set. Everything's packed.

1209
01:24:40,486 --> 01:24:43,159
If there's anything else you need,
just, uh, call us.

1210
01:24:43,246 --> 01:24:47,205
- Anything. Okay?
- Thank you.

1211
01:24:47,286 --> 01:24:49,675
Well, maybe, uh--

1212
01:24:49,766 --> 01:24:52,075
Here, let me, uh-- Go ahead.

1213
01:24:58,006 --> 01:25:00,884
- Gloucester Hotel, please.
- The Gloucester, okay.

1214
01:25:00,966 --> 01:25:04,481
I'll write and let you know
how we're doing.

1215
01:25:05,566 --> 01:25:08,080
Come on, darling.

1216
01:25:08,166 --> 01:25:10,634
Wave goodbye, sweetheart.

1217
01:25:10,726 --> 01:25:13,365
- Bye, Mary.
- Bye, Mary.

1218
01:25:25,486 --> 01:25:30,355
<i>Goodnight, sweetheart</i>
<i>Well, it's time to go</i>

1219
01:25:32,286 --> 01:25:37,076
<i>Goodnight, sweetheart</i>
<i>Well, it's time to go</i>

1220
01:25:38,686 --> 01:25:43,680
<i>I hate to leave you</i>
<i>but I really must say</i>

1221
01:25:43,766 --> 01:25:49,398
<i>Oh, goodnight, sweetheart</i>
<i>Goodnight</i>

1222
01:25:51,126 --> 01:25:55,756
<i>Goodnight, sweetheart</i>
<i>Well, it's time to go</i>

1223
01:25:57,366 --> 01:26:02,076
<i>Goodnight, sweetheart</i>
<i>Well, it's time to go</i>

1224
01:26:03,726 --> 01:26:08,402
<i>I hate to leave you</i>
<i>I really must say</i>

1225
01:26:08,486 --> 01:26:14,277
<i>Oh, goodnight, sweetheart</i>
<i>Goodnight</i>

1226
01:26:14,366 --> 01:26:17,802
<i>Well, it's 3.</i>:<i>00</i>

1227
01:26:17,886 --> 01:26:20,195
<i>In the morning</i>

1228
01:26:21,846 --> 01:26:26,681
<i>Baby, I just can't do right</i>

1229
01:26:26,766 --> 01:26:30,884
<i>Well, I hate to leave you, baby</i>

1230
01:26:30,966 --> 01:26:33,764
<i>I don't mean maybe</i>

1231
01:26:33,846 --> 01:26:37,521
<i>Because I love you so</i>

1232
01:26:40,366 --> 01:26:45,076
<i>Goodnight, sweetheart</i>
<i>Well, it's time to go</i>

1233
01:26:46,566 --> 01:26:51,560
<i>Goodnight, sweetheart</i>
<i>Well, it's time to go</i>

1234
01:26:53,006 --> 01:26:57,636
<i>I hate to leave you</i>
<i>I really must say</i>

1235
01:26:57,726 --> 01:27:02,561
<i>Oh, goodnight, sweetheart</i>
<i>Goodnight</i>

1236
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:09,562
<i>I hate to leave you</i>
<i>I really must say</i>

1237
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:13,958
<i>Oh, goodnight, sweetheart</i>
<i>Goodnight</i>

1238
01:27:26,966 --> 01:27:30,038
Guys like us shouldn't be
raising kids anyway.

1239
01:27:30,126 --> 01:27:31,718
Right?

1240
01:27:31,806 --> 01:27:34,115
Well, should we?

1241
01:27:34,206 --> 01:27:36,720
I suppose not.

1242
01:27:36,806 --> 01:27:38,717
She's better off with her mother.

1243
01:27:41,766 --> 01:27:46,396
And we are definitely better off
now that everything's back to normal.

1244
01:27:46,486 --> 01:27:48,716
- Right?
- Whatever you say,Jack.

1245
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:54,075
Right.

1246
01:27:58,166 --> 01:28:00,964
So how come I feel so bad?

1247
01:28:01,046 --> 01:28:03,480
What'd you say?

1248
01:28:03,566 --> 01:28:07,798
How come I feel so bad?
I have this ache right here.

1249
01:28:07,886 --> 01:28:10,798
I don't know.
What do you think, Mike?

1250
01:28:10,886 --> 01:28:13,081
- It could be the wine.
- It's not the wine.

1251
01:28:13,166 --> 01:28:15,634
Well, what is it then?

1252
01:28:15,726 --> 01:28:18,638
I don't know.
I wish it would go away.

1253
01:28:18,726 --> 01:28:20,637
Maybe it's something you ate.

1254
01:28:22,126 --> 01:28:26,563
- Maybe you're not getting enough sleep.
- It's not that.

1255
01:28:26,646 --> 01:28:28,876
Then what the hell is it?

1256
01:28:30,326 --> 01:28:33,284
I miss Mary.

1257
01:28:35,366 --> 01:28:37,960
Okay?

1258
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:40,355
I miss Mary.

1259
01:28:41,726 --> 01:28:44,160
I just wish there was
something I could do.

1260
01:28:46,126 --> 01:28:48,845
Well, maybe there is.

1261
01:28:50,166 --> 01:28:52,885
- What?
- When's her flight leaving?

1262
01:28:57,566 --> 01:28:59,796
- Yo, taxi!
- Taxi!

1263
01:28:59,886 --> 01:29:02,195
- Taxi!
- Taxi!

1264
01:29:03,966 --> 01:29:05,877
- Kennedy Airport.
- Yeah, Kennedy.

1265
01:29:05,966 --> 01:29:08,275
Kennedy Airport.

1266
01:29:12,286 --> 01:29:14,880
- Who you guys chasing?
- My baby girl.

1267
01:29:14,966 --> 01:29:18,163
- Her mother's taking her to London.
- Oh, yeah? How old?

1268
01:29:18,246 --> 01:29:20,999
- Se-Seven months.
- Seven months.
- Seven months? That's hard work.

1269
01:29:21,086 --> 01:29:22,997
But pretty soon,
they start to walk.

1270
01:29:23,086 --> 01:29:24,997
And let me tell you, the first time you
hear the word ''Daddy''...

1271
01:29:25,086 --> 01:29:28,078
I don't care who you are,
your heart just melts.

1272
01:29:28,166 --> 01:29:30,236
- Can you drive a little faster, please?
- Yeah.

1273
01:29:45,566 --> 01:29:48,876
- Thank you.
- Good luck to you.

1274
01:29:48,966 --> 01:29:51,719
Thanks. Good luck, guys.

1275
01:30:10,006 --> 01:30:13,362
Four. Gate four.

1276
01:30:15,246 --> 01:30:17,476
Excuse me, sir.
Hold it, fellas. One at a time.

1277
01:30:17,566 --> 01:30:20,080
Please, one at a time.
Any metal.

1278
01:30:20,166 --> 01:30:22,555
Put it in here, please.

1279
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:27,078
Thank you, sir.
One at a time. Thank you.

1280
01:30:33,766 --> 01:30:37,122
One, two, three, four. Four!

1281
01:30:40,766 --> 01:30:43,997
- 1 76. Flight 1 76?
- That's it.

1282
01:31:35,366 --> 01:31:37,675
Thank you. Goodnight.

1283
01:32:09,166 --> 01:32:12,078
Sylvia, are you all right?
What happened?

1284
01:32:12,166 --> 01:32:15,636
- We thought you'd gone.
- I couldn't go,Jack. I couldn't do it.

1285
01:32:15,726 --> 01:32:17,956
I mean, I don't want to
make another mistake.

1286
01:32:18,046 --> 01:32:21,755
And I knew if I took her away,
I'd just be making another mistake.

1287
01:32:21,846 --> 01:32:23,359
I mean, I-I have to work.

1288
01:32:23,446 --> 01:32:26,802
I mean, I can't do that
and take care of Mary alone.

1289
01:32:26,886 --> 01:32:28,797
I mean, do you know what it's like?

1290
01:32:28,886 --> 01:32:31,639
A one-room flat,
on your feet all day...

1291
01:32:31,726 --> 01:32:34,035
working or auditioning.

1292
01:32:34,126 --> 01:32:36,082
And I'm on the job sometimes
until 3:00 in the morning.

1293
01:32:36,166 --> 01:32:38,885
- And since Mary gets up at 5:30--
- Oh, I know, I know. It's awful.

1294
01:32:38,966 --> 01:32:41,321
- I mean, you can imagine
how much sleep I get.
- Yeah.

1295
01:32:41,406 --> 01:32:43,840
A-And after the 5:30 bottle,
it starts all over again at 9:00.

1296
01:32:43,926 --> 01:32:46,076
And by the time I change her and play
with her a little, it's already 8:00.

1297
01:32:46,166 --> 01:32:48,077
Well, forget about sleeping after that.
It's impossible.

1298
01:32:48,166 --> 01:32:50,077
And then the babysitters
until 3:00 in the morning.

1299
01:32:50,166 --> 01:32:52,077
All my money
is sucked down the tubes.

1300
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:54,555
And me so tired.
I can't take Mary to the park.

1301
01:32:54,646 --> 01:32:57,160
Oh, tell me about it. Gettin' time to
take her to the park? That's a bitch.

1302
01:32:57,246 --> 01:33:00,875
- Sit down.
- I mean, I love my job, but...

1303
01:33:00,966 --> 01:33:03,560
I sometimes feel like I'm
just working to pay the sitters...

1304
01:33:03,646 --> 01:33:05,876
and I run around all day...

1305
01:33:05,966 --> 01:33:08,082
and I-I don't get enough sleep.

1306
01:33:09,646 --> 01:33:12,160
And what's worse, I don't think
I'm taking very good care of Mary.

1307
01:33:12,246 --> 01:33:15,044
- No, of course you are.
- I am? I mean, I couldn't cope.

1308
01:33:15,126 --> 01:33:19,085
- Sylvia, we know how hard it is.
- Yeah, there's three of us.
We could hardly manage.

1309
01:33:19,166 --> 01:33:23,557
And I don't want to go to London.
I want to work in New York.

1310
01:33:23,646 --> 01:33:26,160
But I can't do that alone.

1311
01:33:26,246 --> 01:33:29,636
I hope I don't have to.

1312
01:33:29,726 --> 01:33:32,843
I need help.
I need someone to help me.

1313
01:33:32,926 --> 01:33:34,757
We'll help. We will help.

1314
01:33:34,846 --> 01:33:37,360
- Yes, yes, absolutely. I mean,
you can leave her anytime you want.
- Yes. Yes.

1315
01:33:37,446 --> 01:33:39,357
- We'd love to have her.
- Oh, gosh, yeah.

1316
01:33:39,446 --> 01:33:42,358
When you go for an audition or--
or you go shopping, or-- or whatever.

1317
01:33:42,446 --> 01:33:44,880
- You want to be by yourself.
- I was hoping you would say that.

1318
01:33:44,966 --> 01:33:46,684
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Really? Oh--

1319
01:33:46,766 --> 01:33:48,722
- Thank you so much. Mary.
- Yeah, of course.

1320
01:33:48,806 --> 01:33:52,401
Hold it, guys. I don't think
I like this arrangement.

1321
01:33:52,486 --> 01:33:55,762
I just don't want to be
Mary's babysitter.

1322
01:33:55,846 --> 01:34:00,476
I want-- We want to be able
to see her all the time. May I?

1323
01:34:00,566 --> 01:34:02,716
I-I agree. So what are you saying?
What do you-- What do you mean?

1324
01:34:02,806 --> 01:34:04,922
I'm saying...

1325
01:34:05,006 --> 01:34:08,794
that I think Mary should
move in with us permanently...

1326
01:34:08,886 --> 01:34:11,002
that we should be her family.

1327
01:34:11,086 --> 01:34:13,725
Well, I-I think it's lovely
of you to offer, Peter...

1328
01:34:13,806 --> 01:34:15,717
but I-I couldn't let Mary--

1329
01:34:15,806 --> 01:34:17,922
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
- Oh, no, you don't understand.

1330
01:34:18,006 --> 01:34:21,476
You're right, Sylvia. She's-- She's your
daughter. She needs a full-time mother.

1331
01:34:21,566 --> 01:34:25,878
- That's why we think that--
that-- that you should move in too.
- We-- We--

1332
01:34:25,966 --> 01:34:27,843
- Oh, it's a great idea. Oh, Sylvia.
- Yeah!
- I--

1333
01:34:27,926 --> 01:34:29,837
- What do you think? Come on.
- Of course, it's better than--
Four is better than three.

1334
01:34:29,926 --> 01:34:32,486
Uh-- Do you-- Do you have room?

1335
01:34:32,566 --> 01:34:35,000
I'll build you a room.
I'll build Mary a room.

1336
01:34:35,086 --> 01:34:36,963
- That's what he does in life.
- Yeah, that's what he does.
He builds rooms.

1337
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:39,685
- Oh, please, say yes.
- Yes!

1338
01:34:39,766 --> 01:34:42,564
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1339
01:34:51,166 --> 01:34:54,283
<i>Something happened, baby</i>
<i>in my life</i>

1340
01:34:54,366 --> 01:34:56,277
<i>The minute I saw you</i>

1341
01:34:56,366 --> 01:34:58,357

1344
01:35:04,566 --> 01:35:08,400
<i>Hey, nothing mattered, baby</i>
<i>in my life</i>

1345
01:35:08,486 --> 01:35:10,556
<i>Till the minute I saw you</i>

1346

<i>I'm happy when I'm near to you</i>

1350
01:35:37,726 --> 01:35:41,355
<i>Yeah, it's true</i>
<i>Can't get any better</i>

1351
01:35:41,446 --> 01:35:44,677
<i>If someone else</i>
<i>would ever turn from me</i>

1352
01:35:44,766 --> 01:35:48,679
<i>You would see</i>
<i>that I wouldn't let her</i>

1353
01:35:48,766 --> 01:35:52,281
<i>Trust me, baby</i>
<i>You're the only one</i>

1354
01:35:52,366 --> 01:35:55,881

01:36:39,166 --> 01:36:42,283

<i>Hey, hey</i>

1391
01:38:07,126 --> 01:38:11,483
<i>Just don't want to</i>
