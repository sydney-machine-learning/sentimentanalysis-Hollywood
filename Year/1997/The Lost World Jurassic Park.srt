1
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:32,493
That looks fabulous.

2
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:35,526
Thank you, Geoffrey.

3
00:01:35,614 --> 00:01:38,889
We'll also take a bottle of red as well.
Thank you.

4
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:44,931
Thank you, Barry.

5
00:01:46,053 --> 00:01:48,886
That looks wonderful. Beautiful day.

6
00:01:50,173 --> 00:01:51,526
Where are you going?

7
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:54,172
- To eat my sandwich.
- You won't be hungry for prawns.

8
00:01:54,252 --> 00:01:57,085
- I don't like prawns.
- Darling, don't wander off.

9
00:01:58,092 --> 00:02:00,560
For God's sake, leave her alone, Deirdre.

10
00:02:01,452 --> 00:02:03,647
- Go play with your ball.
- Don't be so annoying!

11
00:02:09,251 --> 00:02:10,570
Darling...

12
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:12,728
...what about snakes?

13
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:17,849
There aren't any snakes on the beach.
Just let her enjoy herself for once.

14
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:22,285
Edward?

15
00:02:55,528 --> 00:02:57,007
Hello, there.

16
00:02:57,448 --> 00:03:00,485
What are you, a little bird or something?

17
00:03:05,328 --> 00:03:09,081
Are you hungry? Take a bite.
It's roast beef.

18
00:03:09,487 --> 00:03:12,160
It's good. Come on. I won't hurt you.

19
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:18,045
Mummy! Daddy! Come see this!
I found something!

20
00:03:31,286 --> 00:03:33,277
Cathy, darling, lunch is ready!

21
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:37,041
Are you looking at this?

22
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:40,358
I'm afraid there isn't enough to go around.

23
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,840
Paul?

24
00:03:48,845 --> 00:03:49,994
Cathy?

25
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:55,597
Will you hurry up? Hurry up!

26
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:52,592
You're him, right?

27
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,439
Excuse me?

28
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,753
The scientist? The guy? I saw you on TV.

29
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,073
I believed you.

30
00:05:33,878 --> 00:05:36,186
Who shall I tell Mr. Hammond is calling?

31
00:05:36,277 --> 00:05:38,996
Ian Malcolm. I've been summoned.

32
00:06:00,636 --> 00:06:02,035
Dr. Malcolm!

33
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:06,067
Hello, Dr. Malcolm.

34
00:06:06,155 --> 00:06:07,588
Kids, kids.

35
00:06:07,715 --> 00:06:10,673
- It's so great to see you.
- It's so great to see you.

36
00:06:11,715 --> 00:06:13,034
Look at you.

37
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:14,874
You came to see Grandpa?

38
00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:18,072
Yeah, he called me.
Do you know what it's about?

39
00:06:19,275 --> 00:06:22,744
I don't, either.
This joint's kind of creepy, isn't it?

40
00:06:23,154 --> 00:06:24,223
Is everything okay?

41
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,545
Well, not exactly.

42
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:39,345
Dr. Malcolm.

43
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:43,826
Dr. Malcolm. Here to share
a few campfire stories with my uncle?

44
00:06:49,593 --> 00:06:53,585
<i>Convince the Washington Post
and Sceptical Inquirer of what you want...</i>

45
00:06:53,672 --> 00:06:56,266
...but I was there.
I know what happened and so do you.

46
00:06:56,352 --> 00:06:59,549
Do you believe everyone
who chose discretion did so...

47
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:02,749
...for a nefarious motive?
Even Lex and Tim?

48
00:07:02,832 --> 00:07:05,265
Leave them out of it. It's not a game.

49
00:07:05,551 --> 00:07:09,510
No. You signed a nondisclosure agreement
before you went to the island...

50
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:13,664
...that forbade you from discussing what
you saw. You violated that agreement.

51
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:16,709
I did. And you lied about the deaths
of three people.

52
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:19,868
You misinformed the public,
which made me look like a nut.

53
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,702
Not so good for my career-

54
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:24,543
We made a generous compensatory offer
for your injuries.

55
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,063
A payoff and an insult.

56
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,701
When you spin reality, cover up evidence,
it hurts more than my reputation.

57
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,382
As I recall...

58
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,588
...your university revoked your tenure
for your selling wild stories to the press.

59
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:40,587
I didn't sell anything.
I took no money and I told the truth.

60
00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:41,977
Your version of it.

61
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:45,823
There are no " versions" of the truth.
InGen can't keep spewing out-

62
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:50,021
InGen is my responsibility.
I will jealously defend its interests.

63
00:07:50,468 --> 00:07:52,379
Yours? What about Mr. Hammond?

64
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:57,498
It is our board of directors I must face,
not my uncle.

65
00:07:57,668 --> 00:08:01,104
Trust me, your problems
are about to be rendered moot.

66
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:04,864
In a few weeks' time,
they'll be long forgotten.

67
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:08,266
Not by me.

68
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:09,866
Careful.

69
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:14,820
This suit cost more than your education.

70
00:08:16,547 --> 00:08:18,855
<i>You were right and I was wrong. There!</i>

71
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:21,699
<i>Did you ever expect
to hear me say such a thing?</i>

72
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:25,023
Thank God for Site B.

73
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:27,905
Site B?

74
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:32,138
Isla Nublar was just a showroom
for tourists.

75
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:37,380
Site B was the factory floor.
Isla Sorna, 80 miles from Nublar.

76
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:41,135
We bred the animals there,
nurtured them for a few months...

77
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:43,455
...then moved them into the park.

78
00:08:43,665 --> 00:08:45,621
Really? I did not know that.

79
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:48,500
After the accident in the park...

80
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:52,054
...Hurricane Clarissa wiped out
our facility on Site B.

81
00:08:52,184 --> 00:08:54,015
Call it an act of God.

82
00:08:55,064 --> 00:08:57,942
We had to evacuate.
The animals were released...

83
00:08:58,064 --> 00:08:59,941
...to mature on their own.

84
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:04,502
" Life will find a way,"
as you once so eloquently put it.

85
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,655
By now we have a complete
ecological system on the island...

86
00:09:07,783 --> 00:09:10,661
...with dozens of species
living in social groups...

87
00:09:10,743 --> 00:09:14,577
...without fences, boundaries
or constraining technology.

88
00:09:14,743 --> 00:09:16,540
And for four years...

89
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:20,572
...I've tried to keep it safe
from human interference.

90
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:26,259
Right. Hopefully, you've kept
the island quarantined and contained.

91
00:09:26,342 --> 00:09:30,301
But I'm in shock.
I mean, that they're still alive.

92
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,533
You bred them lysine-deficient.

93
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:36,336
Shouldn't they have kicked after seven
days without supplemental enzymes?

94
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:38,810
But, by God, they're flourishing.

95
00:09:38,901 --> 00:09:42,018
That's one of 1,000 questions
I want the team to answer.

96
00:09:42,141 --> 00:09:43,256
Team?

97
00:09:44,821 --> 00:09:48,813
I've organised an expedition to go in...

98
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,655
...thank you, and document them.

99
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:56,018
To make the most spectacular living
fossil record the world has ever seen.

100
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,297
Go in and document?
You mean with people?

101
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:02,769
Yes, the animals won't know they're there.
Very low impact.

102
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:05,532
Strictly observation and documentation.

103
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:10,574
Our satellite infrareds
show the animals are fiercely territorial.

104
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,891
The carnivores are isolated
in the interior of the island...

105
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:16,413
...so the team can stay on the outer rim.

106
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:20,248
Don't worry.
I'm not making the same mistakes again.

107
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:22,852
No, you're making all new ones.

108
00:10:24,058 --> 00:10:27,892
John! So, there's another island
with dinosaurs...

109
00:10:28,018 --> 00:10:31,488
...no fences this time,
and you want to send people in...

110
00:10:31,658 --> 00:10:34,933
...very few people, on the ground, right?

111
00:10:35,457 --> 00:10:38,290
Who are the four lunatics
you're trying to con into this?

112
00:10:38,377 --> 00:10:41,255
It was hard to convince them
of what they would see...

113
00:10:41,377 --> 00:10:43,652
...in the end had to use my chequebook.

114
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:48,128
But there's Nick van Owen,
a video documentarian...

115
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:53,053
...Eddie Carr,
who's a field equipment expert.

116
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:56,805
We have our palaeontologist...

117
00:10:57,216 --> 00:11:00,845
...and I was hoping that perhaps
you might be the fourth.

118
00:11:02,655 --> 00:11:06,364
We've been on the verge of Chapter 11
since that accident in the park.

119
00:11:06,495 --> 00:11:10,090
There are those in the company
who wanted to exploit Site B...

120
00:11:10,215 --> 00:11:12,012
...in order to bail us out.

121
00:11:12,095 --> 00:11:16,407
They've been planning it for years,
but I've stopped them until now.

122
00:11:17,174 --> 00:11:20,689
A few weeks ago,
a British family on a yacht cruise...

123
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:26,094
...stumbled across the island
and their wee girl was injured.

124
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:28,127
She's fine.

125
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:33,691
But the board has used the incident
to take control of InGen from me.

126
00:11:34,773 --> 00:11:37,765
Now it's only a matter of time before this...

127
00:11:38,293 --> 00:11:40,966
...lost world is found and pillaged.

128
00:11:42,653 --> 00:11:47,487
Public opinion is the one thing I can use
to preserve it, but to rally that support...

129
00:11:47,812 --> 00:11:50,326
...I need a complete photo record...

130
00:11:50,412 --> 00:11:53,324
...of those animals alive
in their natural habitat.

131
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:57,009
So you went from capitalist
to naturalist in just four years.

132
00:11:57,892 --> 00:11:59,041
That's something.

133
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:05,486
It's our last chance at redemption.

134
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:10,205
John...

135
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:12,400
...no.

136
00:12:13,051 --> 00:12:15,087
Of course, no.

137
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:18,845
And I'm going to contact
the other three members of your team...

138
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,841
...and stop them from going.

139
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,200
Who's the palaeontologist, by the way?

140
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,765
She came to me, I want you to know.

141
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:27,925
Who did?

142
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,162
Leave it to you, Ian, to have associations...

143
00:12:31,249 --> 00:12:34,366
...even liaisons with the best people
in so many fields.

144
00:12:34,449 --> 00:12:35,643
Not Sarah.

145
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:40,325
Palaeontological behaviour study is a new
field, and Sarah Harding is on that frontier.

146
00:12:40,489 --> 00:12:44,607
Her theories on parenting and nurturing
in carnivores have framed the debate.

147
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:47,317
- What are you doing?
- Where's your phone?

148
00:12:50,648 --> 00:12:52,127
It's too late.

149
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:54,640
She's already there.

150
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,876
The others are meeting her in three days.

151
00:13:06,927 --> 00:13:09,885
You sent my girlfriend to this island alone?

152
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:13,559
" Sent" is hardly the word.
She couldn't be restrained.

153
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:17,355
She was already in San Diego,
doing research at the animal park.

154
00:13:17,566 --> 00:13:20,000
It's only a few hours' flight from there.

155
00:13:20,086 --> 00:13:23,601
She was adamant,
absolutely adamant about, here you are...

156
00:13:23,726 --> 00:13:26,559
...about making the initial foray by herself.

157
00:13:26,846 --> 00:13:28,757
She thinks she's Dian Fossey.

158
00:13:28,886 --> 00:13:32,958
" Observation without interference,"
she said. You know how it is.

159
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:36,715
After you were injured in the park,
she sought you out.

160
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,117
Then she went all the way to a hospital
in Costa Rica...

161
00:13:40,205 --> 00:13:43,754
...to ask someone she didn't know
if the rumours were true.

162
00:13:43,845 --> 00:13:46,597
If you want to leave your name
on something, fine.

163
00:13:46,684 --> 00:13:49,960
But stop putting it
on other people's headstones.

164
00:13:50,244 --> 00:13:54,715
She'll be fine. She's spent years
studying African predators.

165
00:13:54,804 --> 00:13:58,240
Sleeping downwind and all.
She knows what she's doing.

166
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,958
And, believe me, the research team will-

167
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:07,198
It's not a research expedition anymore.
It's a rescue operation and it's leaving now.

168
00:14:26,322 --> 00:14:29,393
I can't shave three days off my deadline
and expect to be ready.

169
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:31,949
I'm not supplied.
I haven't tested any of this.

170
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,879
Why give her a satellite phone
if it doesn't work?

171
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:38,431
Could be solar flares, the satellite,
or maybe she turned it off.

172
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:41,911
I need half air on the tires.
We're flying pressurised.

173
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:44,195
- Does she know how to use it?
- You kidding?

174
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,192
She's faxed me refinements
on half the plans for this stuff.

175
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,033
Don't do that. You have to baby it.
Love it.

176
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,953
- I'll love it when it works.
- It'll work when you love it.

177
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,350
- You coming along?
- I don't usually, but I can't resist.

178
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,271
Thanks for the two-minute warning.

179
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,271
Nick van Owen, Ian Malcolm.
Nick's our photographer.

180
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:03,237
How do you do?

181
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,755
- You do wildlife photography?
- Wildlife, combat, you name it.

182
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,354
<i>When I was with Nightline,
I was in Rwanda, Chechnya, Bosnia.</i>

183
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:13,033
I do volunteer work for Greenpeace
once in a while.

184
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:15,029
What drew you to Greenpeace?

185
00:15:15,478 --> 00:15:16,627
Women.

186
00:15:17,438 --> 00:15:19,156
Greenpeace is 80-percent female.

187
00:15:19,718 --> 00:15:20,787
Noble.

188
00:15:21,638 --> 00:15:24,471
Noble was last year.
This year I'm getting paid.

189
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:28,153
Hammond's check cleared,
or I wouldn't go on this wild-goose chase.

190
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:32,232
You're going to the only place
where the geese chase you.

191
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:34,869
Dad! Dad!

192
00:15:37,197 --> 00:15:40,030
Kelly, honey, you found it.
What took you so long?

193
00:15:40,157 --> 00:15:41,510
Couldn't get a cab.

194
00:15:41,597 --> 00:15:46,386
Sweetie, that's okay.
I've got to tell you something.

195
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:51,624
- I don't even know this woman.
- You've known Karen for 10 years.

196
00:15:51,956 --> 00:15:54,993
She doesn't have Sega.
She's such a troglodyte.

197
00:15:55,076 --> 00:15:57,067
Cruel, but good word use.

198
00:15:57,476 --> 00:15:59,352
Why can't I stay with Sarah?

199
00:15:59,435 --> 00:16:02,313
She's out of town. Karen's fantastic.

200
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:05,228
She'll take you places.
You'll have a fantastic time.

201
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:08,273
Stop saying "fantastic. "
Where are you going?

202
00:16:08,915 --> 00:16:13,112
It's only for a few days.
I wouldn't be going if it wasn't important.

203
00:16:13,194 --> 00:16:17,631
I'm your daughter full time. You can't
abandon me whenever opportunity knocks.

204
00:16:17,994 --> 00:16:20,588
That hurts. Your mom tell you to say that?

205
00:16:20,674 --> 00:16:22,983
<i>Dr. Malcolm, downstairs, please.</i>

206
00:16:23,474 --> 00:16:25,544
I know we've had some hard going.

207
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:29,109
But in the last few years,
we've started to work things out.

208
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:33,431
Yeah, but crack on me a bit. Ground me
or something. Send me to my room.

209
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:35,464
You never do any of that stuff.

210
00:16:35,553 --> 00:16:37,669
Why would I? You turned out so...

211
00:16:37,753 --> 00:16:41,189
...beautiful, brilliant, powerful,
funny and generous.

212
00:16:41,273 --> 00:16:43,342
The queen, goddess. My inspiration.

213
00:16:43,472 --> 00:16:44,507
<i>Dr. Malcolm.</i>

214
00:16:44,592 --> 00:16:48,107
I could come be your research assistant,
like in Austin.

215
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:50,542
This is nothing like Austin.

216
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:53,988
Anyway, you have your own stuff.

217
00:16:54,072 --> 00:16:57,223
Your gymnastics competition.
You've been training for months.

218
00:16:57,312 --> 00:16:58,664
Gymnastics?

219
00:16:58,871 --> 00:17:02,500
I scrubbed out, got cut from the team.
Thanks for knowing.

220
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:05,509
I'm sorry, honey.

221
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:08,825
I know how much that meant to you.

222
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:12,946
You like having kids.
You just don't want to be with them.

223
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:19,586
It wasn't me who dumped you and split
for Paris, so don't take it out on me.

224
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,946
<i>Dr. Malcolm, downstairs!</i>

225
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:30,464
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

226
00:17:32,069 --> 00:17:35,141
You want some good parental advice?
Don't listen to me.

227
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:40,700
How are we doing here?

228
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:45,622
The specs say it can't deform at 12,000 PSl,
so we'll test it.

229
00:17:45,708 --> 00:17:48,176
- Let's clear. We clear?
- What's this?

230
00:17:49,828 --> 00:17:51,181
A high hide.

231
00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:54,985
A high hide.
You know, you go up and hide, high.

232
00:17:55,228 --> 00:17:59,937
It goes up to where the trees are and
keeps the researchers out of harm's way.

233
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:03,818
Actually, it puts them
at a very convenient biting height.

234
00:18:04,707 --> 00:18:06,265
Do you have the time?

235
00:18:06,827 --> 00:18:09,216
- Why?
- We're leaving in three hours.

236
00:18:28,265 --> 00:18:29,857
This is so cool.

237
00:19:26,461 --> 00:19:30,249
Lindstradt air rifle.
Fires a subsonic Fluger dart.

238
00:19:30,341 --> 00:19:33,219
- It work better than your satellite phone?
- Funny.

239
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:37,135
<i>I loaded it with enhanced venom from
Conus purpurascens: South Sea cone shell.</i>

240
00:19:37,221 --> 00:19:40,690
Most powerful neurotoxin in the world.
Acts within 0.002 of a second.

241
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,771
Faster than nerve-conduction velocity.

242
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,051
So the animal's down
before it even feels the dart.

243
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,257
- Is there an antidote?
- Like if you shot yourself in the foot?

244
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,377
Don't do that.
You'd be dead before you realised it.

245
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:00,854
He says he's unloading us here.
He won't go further up the river.

246
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:05,730
He's heard too many stories.
He'll drop us off and anchor offshore.

247
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:07,411
What kind of stories?

248
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:17,211
Stories of fishermen that came too close
to the island and never returned.

249
00:20:17,978 --> 00:20:20,776
He has a radio. He has a satellite phone.

250
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:26,615
When you need him,
call and he'll be here in two hours.

251
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,848
But he will not stay here.

252
00:20:30,217 --> 00:20:32,777
He won't stay anywhere near these islands.

253
00:20:32,897 --> 00:20:35,934
<i>They call the islands " Las Cinco Muertes"?</i>

254
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:39,776
What does that mean?

255
00:20:41,336 --> 00:20:42,815
" The Five Deaths"...

256
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:44,729
...he says.

257
00:20:58,695 --> 00:21:03,132
I put a location sensor in Dr. Harding's
phone, so we should get a reading.

258
00:21:03,215 --> 00:21:05,888
- I'm so relieved.
- Don't push my buttons.

259
00:21:05,975 --> 00:21:09,603
We're almost on top of her dot.
She should be around here.

260
00:21:10,494 --> 00:21:11,847
Over there.

261
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:26,088
Sarah!

262
00:21:28,773 --> 00:21:30,570
Sarah Harding!

263
00:21:30,933 --> 00:21:33,686
How many Sarahs do you think
are on this island?

264
00:21:44,412 --> 00:21:45,527
What?

265
00:21:47,452 --> 00:21:48,931
Something big.

266
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:21,088
This is magnificent.

267
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:24,487
Yeah. " Ooh, ah,"
that's how it always starts.

268
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:28,007
But then later
there's running and screaming.

269
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:53,123
Nick!

270
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:58,641
I guess you got the jump on us,
didn't you, Sarah?

271
00:22:58,727 --> 00:22:59,716
Yeah.

272
00:23:04,087 --> 00:23:07,716
Ian, I never thought Hammond
could get you to come here.

273
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:12,403
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hi, Sarah.

274
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,917
Got a granola bar or something?
I'm starving.

275
00:23:17,766 --> 00:23:19,484
Did you see those animals?

276
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:23,717
A family group, a pair-bond and a subadult,
long after the juvenile was nest bound.

277
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:26,723
Every egg clutch I've seen has crushed,
trampled shells.

278
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:30,320
Hatchlings stay in the birth environment
a long time. That's conclusive.

279
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:33,715
I can end that controversy
if I get a shot of the nest.

280
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,842
Have you been attacked?

281
00:23:35,965 --> 00:23:39,320
No, that's my lucky pack.
That's how it always looks.

282
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:42,718
Okay, Sarah-

283
00:23:42,804 --> 00:23:45,557
Is that a Nikon? Can I borrow it?

284
00:23:46,284 --> 00:23:48,434
I'll be right back, I promise.

285
00:23:51,284 --> 00:23:55,959
When Hammond called you,
why didn't you say something to me?

286
00:23:56,203 --> 00:23:58,433
I knew you would have stopped me
from coming.

287
00:23:58,523 --> 00:24:00,718
I would have tied you to the bed.

288
00:24:00,803 --> 00:24:04,159
- I know how they survived without lysine.
- I don't care.

289
00:24:04,283 --> 00:24:06,797
The herbivore species that are thriving...

290
00:24:06,883 --> 00:24:10,192
...eat mostly agama beans, soy,
anything lysine-rich.

291
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,440
And the carnivores eat
the herbivores, so...

292
00:24:15,362 --> 00:24:16,920
Wait.

293
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:21,115
Stay there. Be quiet. I'll be back.

294
00:24:24,321 --> 00:24:25,834
Stay there.

295
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:56,558
She's much too close.

296
00:24:56,639 --> 00:24:59,107
- What is she doing?
- Too close.

297
00:25:19,838 --> 00:25:23,034
She has to touch it. She can't not touch.

298
00:25:24,197 --> 00:25:27,667
- She's going right up to it.
- Once she sees something, she has to...

299
00:25:36,436 --> 00:25:38,267
Is this even possible?

300
00:25:39,476 --> 00:25:40,465
What?

301
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:45,751
This? What did you think you'd document?
What did you think you'd see?

302
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,111
Animals. Maybe...

303
00:25:49,996 --> 00:25:51,508
...big iguanas.

304
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:55,504
Fruitcakes.

305
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:05,194
He got very angry.

306
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,029
Shoot him!

307
00:26:17,114 --> 00:26:18,706
They're protecting their baby.

308
00:26:18,794 --> 00:26:19,988
So am I!

309
00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:42,424
I think they're leaving.

310
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:56,107
Incredible. Guys shoot their whole life
and never get stuff half this good.

311
00:26:56,311 --> 00:26:58,825
Just give me the Pulitzer right now.

312
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:03,390
The competition's over, close the entries,
I'd like to thank everyone who lost.

313
00:27:03,471 --> 00:27:06,826
Don't light that!
Dinosaurs pick up scents from miles away.

314
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,663
We're here to observe and document,
not interact.

315
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,423
Which is a scientific impossibility.

316
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,707
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.
What you study, you change.

317
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:19,220
I'll risk it. I'm sick of scratching around
in rock and bone...

318
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:23,018
...making assumptions about
the nurturing habits of animals...

319
00:27:23,149 --> 00:27:25,902
...that have been dead for 65 million years.

320
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:29,744
Then you fill my head with stories.
Of course I came down here.

321
00:27:29,829 --> 00:27:32,707
Stories of mutilation and death.
Were you paying attention?

322
00:27:32,789 --> 00:27:35,302
Please! Don't treat me like a grad student.

323
00:27:35,388 --> 00:27:37,982
I've worked around predators
since I was 20.

324
00:27:38,108 --> 00:27:40,542
Lions, jackals, hyenas, you.

325
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:49,899
Where's the fire?

326
00:27:50,187 --> 00:27:52,985
I'm trying to change 100 years
of entrenched dogma.

327
00:27:53,107 --> 00:27:56,702
Dinosaurs were characterised early on
as vicious lizards.

328
00:27:56,787 --> 00:28:00,063
There's resistance to the idea of them
as nurturing parents.

329
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:02,581
Robert Burke said the T. Rex was a rogue...

330
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:06,579
...who abandoned its young at the first
opportunity. I can prove otherwise.

331
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:09,544
Fire! Dr. Malcolm, fire, base camp!

332
00:28:15,346 --> 00:28:18,224
No! Water makes the smoke billow.
Use dirt!

333
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:20,142
Who started the fire?

334
00:28:21,465 --> 00:28:23,615
I just wanted to make dinner.

335
00:28:24,065 --> 00:28:26,863
I wanted it ready when you guys got back.

336
00:28:29,105 --> 00:28:31,858
Do you see any family resemblance there?

337
00:28:32,985 --> 00:28:34,736
You practically told me to come.

338
00:28:34,824 --> 00:28:36,052
I... What?

339
00:28:36,544 --> 00:28:40,219
You said, " Don't listen to me. "
I thought you were trying to tell me-

340
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:43,057
Kelly, you knew exactly what I meant.
You have no-

341
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:46,739
You want to lock her up for her curiosity?
Where do you think she gets it?

342
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:50,782
- Thank you, Sarah.
- Don't start the teaming-up thing.

343
00:28:52,463 --> 00:28:55,899
Out of the conversation. Please. Really.

344
00:28:56,543 --> 00:29:00,172
Eddie, why doesn't this thing ever work?

345
00:29:00,263 --> 00:29:03,494
It's not a land line.
You're not in a phone booth.

346
00:29:03,623 --> 00:29:05,613
Wait for a decent signal.

347
00:29:07,982 --> 00:29:11,338
Violence and technology:
not good bedfellows.

348
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:17,491
Hammond wants your equipment
as close to the animals as possible.

349
00:29:17,582 --> 00:29:20,857
Great idea. And why don't you smear on
a little sheep's blood?

350
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:24,929
Eddie, is there any reason to think
the radio in the trailer might work?

351
00:29:25,061 --> 00:29:26,494
Don't tease me.

352
00:29:26,621 --> 00:29:30,091
If you feel qualified,
try flicking the switch to " on. "

353
00:29:31,461 --> 00:29:34,258
Okay, I'm taking my daughter out of here.

354
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,372
Anyone coming with me,
this is your last chance.

355
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,935
When you're out in the field...

356
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,338
Nick, if you're staying, I'll gladly deliver
a letter to your wife or loved one...

357
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,172
...so you can say good-bye.

358
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,177
Eddie, if you have any personal effects...

359
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:52,171
...it's the least I can do.
I'll be in there, guys.

360
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:54,819
Our presence needs
to be 100-percent antiseptic.

361
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:57,208
If we so much as bend a blade of grass...

362
00:29:57,339 --> 00:30:00,172
- Dad, are you mad?
- No, I'm not mad. I'm furious.

363
00:30:01,899 --> 00:30:03,616
This looks like your room.

364
00:30:03,698 --> 00:30:06,087
- I was going to clean it up.
- Right now.

365
00:30:07,378 --> 00:30:10,415
What is this? There are 100 switches!

366
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:14,332
Don't be mad. I was going to call
to let you know where I was.

367
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:16,369
I always do, don't I?

368
00:30:16,658 --> 00:30:19,490
I'm the best kind of girlfriend there is.

369
00:30:19,657 --> 00:30:23,570
One who travels a lot. You like that.
You love your independence.

370
00:30:23,737 --> 00:30:27,855
I've gotten used to being apart,
but that's not how I want to live.

371
00:30:28,097 --> 00:30:32,409
Kelly, this is tall talk. Just for a minute.

372
00:30:32,617 --> 00:30:35,210
It's like a height restriction
at an amusement park.

373
00:30:36,176 --> 00:30:39,293
If you wanted to rescue me,
why didn't you save me from...

374
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:42,652
...that museum fundraiser
three weeks ago?

375
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,292
This is a slightly different situation.

376
00:30:46,576 --> 00:30:49,965
What about the dinner with your parents
you never showed up for?

377
00:30:50,095 --> 00:30:54,771
Why not rescue me when I need it?
Be there when you say you will?

378
00:30:55,015 --> 00:30:58,291
I have made a career
out of waiting for you.

379
00:30:58,615 --> 00:31:00,765
You know, she has a pretty good-

380
00:31:00,855 --> 00:31:05,245
It's so important to your future that you
not finish that sentence. Please, outside!

381
00:31:06,974 --> 00:31:09,488
Ian, come on. Look.

382
00:31:11,694 --> 00:31:15,448
I love that you rode in here
on a white horse. I really do.

383
00:31:16,734 --> 00:31:19,805
It's very touching, very dramatic.

384
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:23,405
I just need you to show up in a cab
now and then, too.

385
00:31:23,493 --> 00:31:26,405
What are you doing? Don't go out there.
It's not safe.

386
00:31:26,493 --> 00:31:29,246
Stay in here. Come back. Shut the door.

387
00:31:35,892 --> 00:31:39,248
I know what I'm doing.
You guys should definitely go.

388
00:31:40,452 --> 00:31:42,044
But I'm staying.

389
00:31:42,652 --> 00:31:45,803
I love you. I just don't need you right now.

390
00:31:47,251 --> 00:31:50,243
What you need is a good anti-psychotic.

391
00:31:50,611 --> 00:31:54,490
- I'll be back in five or six days.
- You'll be back in five or six pieces.

392
00:31:54,571 --> 00:31:57,449
What bothers you is that I'm not afraid
and you are.

393
00:31:57,531 --> 00:31:59,965
Of course I am. That's the whole thing.

394
00:32:01,371 --> 00:32:02,769
What's that sound?

395
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,964
I'll get you out on one of these right now.

396
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,721
Hello! Over here!

397
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:23,558
I don't get it.
It says InGen on the side of that chopper!

398
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:27,521
I don't get that.
Why would Hammond send two teams?

399
00:32:29,569 --> 00:32:31,365
Cut the umbilical, Dad!

400
00:32:31,768 --> 00:32:34,726
Doesn't he trust us?
We haven't even started.

401
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,478
This is as good a place as any
for base camp.

402
00:32:45,768 --> 00:32:48,122
That's first priority after we're finished.

403
00:32:48,247 --> 00:32:52,001
I want it up and running in 30 minutes.
That's half an hour.

404
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,681
- Understood? Over.
- Cancel that order.

405
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:56,520
What? Why?

406
00:32:56,687 --> 00:32:59,963
This is a game trail.
Carnivores hunt on game trails.

407
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:02,685
You want to set up base camp or a buffet?

408
00:33:06,046 --> 00:33:09,322
Let's find a new spot, shall we?
Over and out.

409
00:33:09,606 --> 00:33:13,519
Peter, if I run your little camping trip,
there are two conditions.

410
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:16,683
First, I'm in charge.
If I'm not around, Dieter is.

411
00:33:16,765 --> 00:33:21,520
You just pay us, tell us we're doing well,
and serve us Scotch after a good day.

412
00:33:21,725 --> 00:33:24,364
Second, my fee. You can keep it.

413
00:33:24,605 --> 00:33:28,234
All I want for my services,
is the right to hunt a Tyrannosaurus.

414
00:33:28,325 --> 00:33:31,043
A male. A buck only.
How and why are my business.

415
00:33:31,124 --> 00:33:33,718
If you don't like those conditions,
you're on your own.

416
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:38,400
So go ahead, set up base camp here,
in a swamp, or in the middle of a Rex nest.

417
00:33:39,204 --> 00:33:44,073
I've had too many safaris with rich dentists
to listen to any more suicidal ideas.

418
00:33:44,244 --> 00:33:45,154
Okay?

419
00:33:52,923 --> 00:33:56,438
Cycle, break off the stray from the herd
and flush him to the right.

420
00:33:56,523 --> 00:34:00,198
Snaggers, stay ready.
He's bringing them out to you. It'll be a...

421
00:34:02,162 --> 00:34:04,881
...Pachy... Pachya... Oh, hell.

422
00:34:05,362 --> 00:34:07,956
The fat head with the bald spot.
Friar Tuck.

423
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,595
Stop.

424
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,159
Pachycephalosaurus.

425
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,468
Carnivore?

426
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,875
No, herbivore, late Cretaceous.

427
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:49,629
See the distinctive domed skull?

428
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,517
Nine inches of solid bone. Now, careful.

429
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,996
A pachy's neck attaches at the bottom
of its skull, not at the back of its head.

430
00:34:59,279 --> 00:35:02,907
When it lowers its head,
its neck lines up with its backbone...

431
00:35:02,998 --> 00:35:05,796
...which is perfect for absorbing impact.

432
00:35:11,558 --> 00:35:15,232
Snagger, Friar Tuck's on the loose,
just about to cross your path.

433
00:36:19,113 --> 00:36:23,391
Dieter, get in the outrigger.
You're closing in on a carina...

434
00:36:24,073 --> 00:36:26,348
Say that again, Roland. A what?

435
00:36:27,593 --> 00:36:30,902
The one with the big red horn.
The pompadour. Elvis.

436
00:36:33,312 --> 00:36:35,109
Take me out.

437
00:36:49,551 --> 00:36:51,223
Okay, Carter, reel me in.

438
00:36:55,831 --> 00:36:56,946
Easy!

439
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,549
Not too close.

440
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,708
Go for the legs! The legs! Watch the tail!

441
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,216
Burke!

442
00:37:52,947 --> 00:37:54,266
Come here.

443
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:01,018
Recognise this trackway?

444
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:03,102
Yes, I do. Tyrannosaur.

445
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:09,260
Roland.

446
00:38:16,265 --> 00:38:17,903
Where do you think you're going?

447
00:38:17,985 --> 00:38:21,136
To collect my fee, Mr. Ludlow.
To collect my fee.

448
00:38:33,824 --> 00:38:34,939
Oh, my God.

449
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:40,342
<i>Procompsognathus Triassicus,
found by Frass in Bavaria in 1913.</i>

450
00:38:40,664 --> 00:38:41,982
Is it dangerous?

451
00:38:43,663 --> 00:38:45,301
No, I wouldn't think so.

452
00:38:46,063 --> 00:38:49,260
The Compy's been presumed
to be a scavengers, like jackals.

453
00:38:50,263 --> 00:38:53,619
It gives me the creeps.
It's like it's not scared.

454
00:38:54,783 --> 00:38:57,057
There haven't been any visitors
to this island.

455
00:38:57,142 --> 00:38:59,053
There's no reason for it to fear man.

456
00:39:03,702 --> 00:39:04,851
Now it does.

457
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,220
It's the Rex nest.

458
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,811
It's probably only a couple weeks old.
Never left the nest.

459
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:40,374
Offspring that young, the parents
won't leave him alone for too long.

460
00:39:42,059 --> 00:39:44,857
Make your blind here?
Wait for the buck to return?

461
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:49,287
If the nest is upwind, then so are we.

462
00:39:50,379 --> 00:39:54,452
When he comes back, he's gonna know
we're here without us having a chance.

463
00:39:55,739 --> 00:39:58,855
The trick is to get him...

464
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:01,689
...to come where we want him.

465
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:53,968
This is why Hammond was in a hurry to
get you here. He knew they were coming.

466
00:40:54,095 --> 00:40:56,050
My God, they are well-organised.

467
00:40:57,214 --> 00:40:59,045
Those are major-league toys.

468
00:41:00,014 --> 00:41:03,848
Maybe I should ask to use their phone.
Their dish is bigger than yours.

469
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:06,933
So they actually want
to build another park here?

470
00:41:07,014 --> 00:41:09,608
After what you said happened
on the other island?

471
00:41:09,694 --> 00:41:13,208
They're not building anything.
They're taking these animals out of here.

472
00:41:13,293 --> 00:41:14,612
Back to the mainland.

473
00:41:16,013 --> 00:41:19,608
I think I should tell you. Hammond told me
these people might show up.

474
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:23,481
He thought we'd be finished by the time
they started, but if they weren't...

475
00:41:23,573 --> 00:41:24,767
...he sent a backup plan.

476
00:41:24,853 --> 00:41:26,205
What backup plan?

477
00:41:27,092 --> 00:41:28,081
Me.

478
00:41:28,852 --> 00:41:33,243
Simply put, InGen is seeking limited
partners to defray some of our expenses.

479
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:36,724
The prospectus you've been given
by the board details...

480
00:41:36,812 --> 00:41:39,565
...our projected hardware
and construction expenses.

481
00:41:39,652 --> 00:41:44,247
As you can see by my two friends here,
the software is already fully developed.

482
00:41:47,411 --> 00:41:50,244
<i>One might say, "It'd be up and running. "</i>

483
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:54,768
<i>In a moment,
I'll take you on a stroll through the camp...</i>

484
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,603
<i>...and you'll see some larger,
more impressive specimens.</i>

485
00:42:25,048 --> 00:42:28,484
You don't bring people halfway
around the world to visit a zoo.

486
00:42:28,808 --> 00:42:30,526
You bring the zoo to them.

487
00:42:30,968 --> 00:42:33,038
San Diego is the perfect setting.

488
00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:37,283
People already associate our beautiful city
with animal attractions:

489
00:42:38,008 --> 00:42:42,558
San Diego Zoo, Sea World,
San Diego Chargers.

490
00:43:09,285 --> 00:43:10,843
Mr. Hammond knew this.

491
00:43:11,725 --> 00:43:13,955
Before he ever dreamt of an island...

492
00:43:15,165 --> 00:43:17,759
...he began construction
on an amphitheatre...

493
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:22,639
...very near to where you're sitting now,
the InGen waterfront complex.

494
00:43:23,405 --> 00:43:25,201
But he abandoned it...

495
00:43:26,044 --> 00:43:29,116
...in favour of something far grander...

496
00:43:29,324 --> 00:43:31,554
...and ultimately impossible.

497
00:43:32,724 --> 00:43:36,194
And so, the facility sits unused,
unfinished...

498
00:43:36,924 --> 00:43:41,235
...when it could be completed and ready
to receive visitors in less than a month.

499
00:44:03,082 --> 00:44:04,959
Ajay, look out! Jump!

500
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,354
That's the last time I leave you in charge.

501
00:44:56,078 --> 00:44:58,114
Oh, my God. Are you out of your mind?

502
00:44:58,198 --> 00:45:01,395
She's got a broken leg.
Let's get in the car before they hear us.

503
00:45:01,478 --> 00:45:04,629
- You have any idea what that is?
- Come on, open the door.

504
00:45:05,398 --> 00:45:06,547
You're nuts.

505
00:45:08,837 --> 00:45:11,271
Man, Ian's not going to like this.

506
00:45:15,677 --> 00:45:16,996
What's going on?

507
00:45:17,357 --> 00:45:18,710
Isn't it obvious?

508
00:45:21,717 --> 00:45:23,672
We're not alone on this island.

509
00:45:33,276 --> 00:45:35,187
It's not set to the frequency.

510
00:45:38,675 --> 00:45:39,744
Look here.

511
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:58,867
What the hell is that?

512
00:46:01,234 --> 00:46:02,633
Hello?

513
00:46:06,833 --> 00:46:09,870
No, not Enrique. Ian Malcolm.
Are you on the boat?

514
00:46:11,233 --> 00:46:12,746
No, is this the boat?

515
00:46:14,553 --> 00:46:18,512
<i>We're on Isla Sorna.
We need to talk to the boat, Mar del Plata.</i>

516
00:46:25,712 --> 00:46:26,906
I'll get him.

517
00:46:27,432 --> 00:46:29,741
All right. That's it. I got you.

518
00:46:30,952 --> 00:46:32,180
- I got you.
- Hurry up.

519
00:46:32,272 --> 00:46:35,901
Let's go. Go. Come on.
Watch his tail. Get the door.

520
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:39,865
Boy, is she mad at you.

521
00:46:39,951 --> 00:46:42,670
- I feel sorry for that guy, Enrique.
- No lectures, please.

522
00:46:42,751 --> 00:46:45,663
Honey, stay back. Don't stand up, okay?

523
00:46:45,911 --> 00:46:47,264
- I got it!
- Watch his head.

524
00:46:48,351 --> 00:46:50,501
- Watch his head.
- Ian, he's hurt!

525
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:53,022
No, honey, no.

526
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:55,986
He'll snip at you. Watch his tail.

527
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:01,703
- All right?
- Okay, I got him.

528
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:02,779
- Got him?
- Yeah.

529
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:06,343
There you go.

530
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:08,738
What must I do, hit her with a stick?

531
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,342
No, don't get close, honey.

532
00:47:10,429 --> 00:47:13,660
- Watch out! Don't stand too close.
- He has that not-so-fresh smell.

533
00:47:15,429 --> 00:47:18,660
No, lady, enough! Wrong frequency.

534
00:47:23,268 --> 00:47:25,987
Nick, don't let him
get those things around you.

535
00:47:31,828 --> 00:47:33,819
Okay, let's take a look at this.

536
00:47:34,628 --> 00:47:37,061
Easy, easy. Just calm down now.

537
00:47:39,187 --> 00:47:41,178
Okay, here are the metatarsals.

538
00:47:46,227 --> 00:47:49,264
Tibia, fibula. There it is.
There's the fracture.

539
00:47:49,347 --> 00:47:51,302
- Right above the epiphysis.
- How bad is it?

540
00:47:51,386 --> 00:47:55,584
If we don't set it, he'll die. It won't heal.
He won't be able to pivot on his ankle.

541
00:47:55,866 --> 00:47:59,222
He won't be able to run or walk.
A predator will pick him off.

542
00:48:00,626 --> 00:48:02,218
Carlos, come in.

543
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,662
Goddamn it, you bastard, listen...

544
00:48:05,585 --> 00:48:07,621
Other animals are going to hear this.

545
00:48:07,705 --> 00:48:09,935
Come in, please. Can you hear me?

546
00:48:10,025 --> 00:48:12,175
I've got to get out of here. I want to leave.

547
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:14,859
- I'm calling the boat.
- I want to go someplace else.

548
00:48:14,945 --> 00:48:17,379
I don't want to be here.
I want to be somewhere safe.

549
00:48:17,465 --> 00:48:20,456
- Isn't it safe here?
- I want to be somewhere high.

550
00:48:20,744 --> 00:48:23,861
What? What is it? What's going on?

551
00:48:24,344 --> 00:48:26,062
Information, please. What?

552
00:48:26,144 --> 00:48:29,580
You're much happier not knowing.
Get us up. Here we go.

553
00:48:31,144 --> 00:48:32,259
There we go.

554
00:48:34,624 --> 00:48:37,535
I'm so stupid.
I shouldn't have come along with you.

555
00:48:38,623 --> 00:48:39,612
Can you set it?

556
00:48:39,703 --> 00:48:44,094
Yeah, I just need something temporary
to break apart and fall off as he grows.

557
00:48:45,143 --> 00:48:47,941
Whenever you're ready.
He's fighting, Dr. Quinn.

558
00:48:52,382 --> 00:48:54,452
What's the frequency for the boat?

559
00:48:54,542 --> 00:48:56,931
15888. Third from the top.

560
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:02,697
Okay, we're high.
This is the safest place you can be.

561
00:49:03,342 --> 00:49:07,175
Like Sarah said, the plants make it
so the animals won't know you're here.

562
00:49:07,261 --> 00:49:10,697
You're just saying that.
I remember the stories you told.

563
00:49:11,221 --> 00:49:15,931
No, this is nothing like that. We're in
a completely different situation now.

564
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,899
Is there a way to communicate
with the trailer?

565
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:33,691
He's moving again, more morphine.

566
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:37,488
We have no idea what his metabolism is.
We'll kill him with too much.

567
00:49:38,419 --> 00:49:41,138
I need your hand here.
Put some pressure there.

568
00:49:41,939 --> 00:49:44,692
No answer. What a surprise.
How do I get down?

569
00:49:45,259 --> 00:49:46,931
Tie this belt around you.

570
00:49:47,419 --> 00:49:48,897
Where are you going?

571
00:49:49,138 --> 00:49:51,129
Stay here. Come on, stay here.

572
00:49:51,218 --> 00:49:52,890
Squeeze this rope hard.

573
00:49:52,978 --> 00:49:55,128
The harder you squeeze, the slower you go.

574
00:49:55,218 --> 00:49:57,778
- If you don't squeeze at all-
- I get the idea.

575
00:49:57,858 --> 00:49:59,416
Dad, please stay here.

576
00:49:59,938 --> 00:50:03,408
- Stay here, please.
- Honey, the queen? The goddess?

577
00:50:04,817 --> 00:50:06,250
Your inspiration?

578
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:08,973
Now you're talking. All right.

579
00:50:12,297 --> 00:50:15,175
I'm coming right back. I give you my word.

580
00:50:15,457 --> 00:50:17,334
But you never keep your word!

581
00:50:23,616 --> 00:50:26,210
Personally, I would have squeezed
just a little harder.

582
00:50:26,336 --> 00:50:28,327
Okay, I'm almost finished.

583
00:50:28,536 --> 00:50:32,211
Damn. I need another adhesive.
Something pliable I can...

584
00:50:36,015 --> 00:50:36,891
Spit.

585
00:50:39,935 --> 00:50:41,050
Your gum.

586
00:51:17,613 --> 00:51:20,206
Get the amoxicillin and fill a syringe.

587
00:51:20,532 --> 00:51:23,251
Quick injection of antibiotics
and he's out of here.

588
00:51:28,892 --> 00:51:31,452
For once in your life,
would it kill you to pick it up?

589
00:51:31,772 --> 00:51:34,763
- Help me get it out of here.
- No, we just set its leg.

590
00:51:40,091 --> 00:51:41,604
Mommy's very angry.

591
00:52:55,206 --> 00:52:58,994
This isn't hunting behaviour, Ian.
They're searching.

592
00:53:00,086 --> 00:53:01,837
They came for their infant.

593
00:53:03,245 --> 00:53:04,963
Let's not disappoint them.

594
00:53:07,245 --> 00:53:08,963
Let me get his head, okay?

595
00:53:10,005 --> 00:53:11,643
Careful. Be careful.

596
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:14,444
I got him.

597
00:53:14,725 --> 00:53:15,919
Muzzle off.

598
00:53:54,202 --> 00:53:57,956
<i>- Yes, Eddie?
- They're going back to the jungle.</i>

599
00:53:58,922 --> 00:54:02,596
<i>- I know. I see. How's Kelly?
- She's fine. She's right here.</i>

600
00:54:04,321 --> 00:54:05,231
Hello?

601
00:54:05,321 --> 00:54:08,199
<i>- Kelly, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.</i>

602
00:54:09,161 --> 00:54:12,915
<i>Stay there. Don't move.
I'll be right back up. Understand?</i>

603
00:54:13,121 --> 00:54:14,554
Yeah, I understand.

604
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:20,676
I beg people to listen to me.
I use plain, simple English.

605
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,389
Shut up.

606
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,233
That should make an interesting chapter
in your book.

607
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:30,155
The debate over the parental instincts
of the T. Rex is now academic.

608
00:54:36,359 --> 00:54:38,315
Hang on. This is gonna be bad.

609
00:54:56,398 --> 00:54:58,468
They're pushing us over the cliff.

610
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:00,073
Oh, my God.

611
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:07,916
Come on, come on.

612
00:55:07,997 --> 00:55:10,033
- Once we're out of here-
- Into the woods.

613
00:55:10,117 --> 00:55:13,905
- Straight into the woods. Come on!
- This is where they hit us.

614
00:55:20,676 --> 00:55:23,144
- Hang on to something!
- Hang on to something!

615
00:56:01,113 --> 00:56:03,263
Oh, my God. Oh, God, please!

616
00:56:08,993 --> 00:56:10,221
Don't move!

617
00:56:11,193 --> 00:56:13,991
I'm coming down for you.
Here I come. Stay still.

618
00:56:15,352 --> 00:56:16,785
Here I come, Sarah.

619
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,463
The satellite phone, get it!

620
00:56:59,509 --> 00:57:00,942
Give me your hand.

621
00:57:06,869 --> 00:57:08,302
Heads up!

622
00:57:20,468 --> 00:57:21,742
Your lucky pack.

623
00:57:27,588 --> 00:57:28,656
I got her.

624
00:57:58,625 --> 00:58:00,422
- Nick?
- We're in here.

625
00:58:00,545 --> 00:58:02,501
Wait. Hold on! I'm coming!

626
00:58:03,265 --> 00:58:04,380
I'm coming.

627
00:58:11,425 --> 00:58:12,619
What did this?

628
00:58:13,144 --> 00:58:15,214
Kelly. What'd you do with Kelly?

629
00:58:15,384 --> 00:58:17,500
She's okay. She's in the High Hide.

630
00:58:18,464 --> 00:58:21,058
- Who's hurt? What do you need?
- We need rope.

631
00:58:21,344 --> 00:58:22,823
Rope. Anything else?

632
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:26,223
- Three cheeseburgers with everything.
- No onions on mine.

633
00:58:26,304 --> 00:58:27,941
And an apple turnover.

634
00:59:04,501 --> 00:59:05,490
Hold on.

635
00:59:07,621 --> 00:59:08,736
I'm coming!

636
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,093
Bring the rope. Let's go.

637
00:59:11,181 --> 00:59:12,738
- I'm coming.
- Now, now.

638
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:15,528
- Eddie, you all right?
- Yeah. I'm coming.

639
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,288
We need the rope. Throw it down here.
Hurry!

640
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,288
Good throw. Did you tie this to anything?

641
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,933
- We're sliding!
- We're sliding down!

642
00:59:41,699 --> 00:59:43,097
Up you go.

643
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:55,007
Increase your rate of climb.

644
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,880
Our communication equipment's
been destroyed.

645
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:17,828
And if your radio and satellite phone
were in those trailers-

646
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,229
- They were.
- Then we're stuck here.

647
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:22,715
And stuck together, thanks to you people.

648
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,472
We came to watch.
You came to strip-mine the place.

649
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:27,789
- Back off.
- At least we came prepared.

650
01:04:27,919 --> 01:04:32,470
Five years of work and electrified fence
couldn't prepare the other island.

651
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:36,678
- You think your Marlboro men will help?
- You're looters. You came to take.

652
01:04:36,759 --> 01:04:37,874
You have no rights.

653
01:04:37,959 --> 01:04:40,518
An extinct animal brought
back to life has no rights.

654
01:04:40,598 --> 01:04:43,715
It exists because we made it.
We patented it. We own it.

655
01:04:44,998 --> 01:04:47,831
- You looking for a problem?
- And I found you, didn't I?

656
01:04:52,478 --> 01:04:53,592
I know you.

657
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:56,393
You're that Earth First bastard.

658
01:04:56,677 --> 01:04:58,827
- What's Earth First?
- Professional saboteurs.

659
01:04:58,917 --> 01:05:00,270
- Environmentalists!
- Criminals.

660
01:05:00,357 --> 01:05:01,995
Knock it off! Listen to me.

661
01:05:02,117 --> 01:05:05,792
Moving the baby to our camp may have
changed the adults' perceived territory.

662
01:05:05,877 --> 01:05:07,026
Their what?

663
01:05:07,397 --> 01:05:09,830
That's why they attacked the trailers.

664
01:05:09,996 --> 01:05:13,352
- They're defending this entire area now.
- We have to move now.

665
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:17,628
To where? Our boat and their airlift
are waiting for orders we can't send.

666
01:05:19,196 --> 01:05:23,268
There's a communications centre here
near the old operations building.

667
01:05:23,355 --> 01:05:27,143
Everything ran on geothermal power.
It was never meant to need replenishing.

668
01:05:27,635 --> 01:05:30,547
If we can get here,
we can send a radio call to the airlift.

669
01:05:31,115 --> 01:05:33,629
- You know the frequency?
- Here in this book.

670
01:05:33,835 --> 01:05:36,269
- We'll mind those.
- How far is the village?

671
01:05:36,555 --> 01:05:38,226
A day's walk, maybe more.

672
01:05:41,754 --> 01:05:44,029
- That's not the problem.
- What is?

673
01:05:45,314 --> 01:05:46,793
What is the problem?

674
01:05:47,674 --> 01:05:48,868
Velociraptors.

675
01:05:54,153 --> 01:05:58,305
Their nesting sites are
in the island's interior, which is why...

676
01:05:58,673 --> 01:06:01,790
- ... we were keeping to the outer rim.
- Wait. What's a Veloc-

677
01:06:01,873 --> 01:06:04,671
Velociraptor. Carnivore. Pack hunter.

678
01:06:05,393 --> 01:06:07,348
Two meters tall, long snout...

679
01:06:07,632 --> 01:06:11,466
...binocular vision, strong forearms,
killing claws on both feet.

680
01:06:11,832 --> 01:06:16,189
The Rexes may track us, too,
if they feel we're a threat to their infant.

681
01:06:16,352 --> 01:06:19,389
No, we'll lose them
once we leave their territory.

682
01:06:19,552 --> 01:06:23,510
Don't bet on it. Tyrannosaur has the
largest proportional olfactory cavity...

683
01:06:23,591 --> 01:06:26,310
...of any creature in fossil record,
except one.

684
01:06:27,871 --> 01:06:31,227
The Turkey Vulture
could scent up to 10 miles.

685
01:06:31,311 --> 01:06:35,668
Right. This is all very thrilling,
but I say we should head for the village.

686
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:38,020
We could head back down to the lagoon.

687
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:42,103
And sit out in the open,
near a heavily used water source...

688
01:06:42,350 --> 01:06:45,547
- ... hope that your captain comes back?
- He won't. He knows better.

689
01:06:45,630 --> 01:06:49,339
Then we head for the village,
find shelter and call for help.

690
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:52,303
Rex just fed, so he won't stalk us for food.

691
01:06:52,389 --> 01:06:55,301
Just fed? You mean Eddie?
Show some respect.

692
01:06:55,389 --> 01:06:58,699
- He saved our lives by giving his.
- Then his troubles are over.

693
01:06:58,789 --> 01:07:01,508
My point is predators don't hunt
when they're not hungry.

694
01:07:01,589 --> 01:07:03,944
- No, only humans do.
- You're breaking our heart.

695
01:07:04,029 --> 01:07:06,463
Saddle up!
Let's get this moveable feast underway.

696
01:07:23,627 --> 01:07:25,026
Excuse me, cowboy.

697
01:07:26,507 --> 01:07:27,906
You want some gum?

698
01:07:30,307 --> 01:07:33,777
You seem like you have common sense.
Why the hell are you here?

699
01:07:35,467 --> 01:07:38,617
Somewhere on this island
is the greatest predator that ever lived.

700
01:07:38,786 --> 01:07:41,425
The second greatest predator
must take him down.

701
01:07:41,506 --> 01:07:44,384
- You going to use that?
- If he doesn't surrender, yes.

702
01:07:44,666 --> 01:07:46,384
- Let me see it.
- No.

703
01:07:48,226 --> 01:07:51,661
The animal exists for the first time
in tens of millions of years...

704
01:07:51,745 --> 01:07:54,623
...and the only way you can express
yourself is to kill it.

705
01:07:54,705 --> 01:07:57,583
Remember that chap about 20 years ago?
I forget his name.

706
01:07:57,665 --> 01:08:00,623
Climbed Everest without any oxygen.
Came down nearly dead.

707
01:08:00,905 --> 01:08:03,624
They asked him,
"Why did you go up there to die?"

708
01:08:03,825 --> 01:08:06,463
He said, " I didn't. I went up there to live. "

709
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:15,179
I didn't wish you luck on your new venture.
You're off to a promising start.

710
01:08:15,264 --> 01:08:18,062
My team is intact.
I'm sorry for the loss of your man.

711
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:22,336
It's easy to criticise someone
who generates an idea, assumes the risk.

712
01:08:22,423 --> 01:08:25,335
When you try to sound like Hammond,
it comes off as a hustle.

713
01:08:25,423 --> 01:08:28,495
It's not your fault.
They say talent skips a generation.

714
01:08:28,943 --> 01:08:31,411
I'm sure your kids will be sharp as tacks.

715
01:08:31,743 --> 01:08:34,655
Hammond's reach exceeded his grasp.
Mine does not.

716
01:08:35,023 --> 01:08:36,774
Taking dinosaurs off this island...

717
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:40,616
...is the worst idea in the long,
sad history of bad ideas.

718
01:08:40,702 --> 01:08:43,136
And I'll be there when you learn that.

719
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:17,776
Take a break. Five minutes.

720
01:09:29,539 --> 01:09:30,858
Are you injured?

721
01:09:33,379 --> 01:09:37,769
No, it's the baby's. I set its broken leg.
It won't dry in the humidity.

722
01:09:37,898 --> 01:09:39,968
Roland, a word?

723
01:09:41,538 --> 01:09:43,733
I'd love to know where we are.

724
01:09:48,778 --> 01:09:50,688
Making friends with Ahab?

725
01:10:05,416 --> 01:10:07,691
Carter, I'm going to the ladies' room.

726
01:10:08,016 --> 01:10:10,166
Wait for me here. Okay?

727
01:10:58,533 --> 01:11:00,808
It's not polite to sneak up on people.

728
01:11:20,411 --> 01:11:23,528
Carter! Where are you?

729
01:11:28,331 --> 01:11:30,242
I got turned around in here.

730
01:11:32,611 --> 01:11:33,599
Shit!

731
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:37,249
Carter, let me hear from you!

732
01:13:34,322 --> 01:13:36,358
Okay, break's over. Moving on!

733
01:13:44,242 --> 01:13:45,436
Carry me.

734
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:16,708
Get off!

735
01:15:15,396 --> 01:15:18,512
- When did you last see him?
-10, 15 minutes.

736
01:15:20,955 --> 01:15:24,106
Come with me. And you.
If he's alive, we'll find him.

737
01:15:24,595 --> 01:15:27,871
The rest of you go on.
You'll reach the ridge in 10 minutes.

738
01:15:28,115 --> 01:15:29,514
Wait for us there.

739
01:15:32,674 --> 01:15:34,551
No one tells the little girl.

740
01:15:39,634 --> 01:15:42,626
Right. Let's carry on.

741
01:15:45,234 --> 01:15:47,110
Everybody up.

742
01:15:48,713 --> 01:15:50,351
Come on. Up, up.

743
01:15:51,793 --> 01:15:54,512
All right guys, let's get the hell out of here.

744
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:45,622
Did you find him?

745
01:16:50,149 --> 01:16:52,788
Just the parts they didn't like. Map.

746
01:16:56,029 --> 01:16:59,657
The operations building
is right down in there...

747
01:17:00,068 --> 01:17:02,866
...about a mile and a half
from the base of these cliffs.

748
01:17:02,948 --> 01:17:05,098
- How do you know that?
- I've seen it.

749
01:17:05,748 --> 01:17:07,625
The climb down won't be easy.

750
01:17:08,948 --> 01:17:11,257
We'll let them sleep one more hour.

751
01:17:12,788 --> 01:17:14,062
Then we hit it.

752
01:19:17,859 --> 01:19:19,008
What is that?

753
01:19:53,857 --> 01:19:55,927
Stay down! Don't move!

754
01:19:56,417 --> 01:19:57,326
Don't run!

755
01:20:05,616 --> 01:20:07,607
Don't look, just run! Run!

756
01:20:22,495 --> 01:20:23,291
Bastard!

757
01:21:58,008 --> 01:21:59,407
You son of a bitch!

758
01:21:59,688 --> 01:22:01,644
He can't reach you! Stay back!

759
01:22:03,888 --> 01:22:05,287
He can't reach us!

760
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:19,605
Oh, my God! A snake!

761
01:22:20,087 --> 01:22:21,281
Stay back!

762
01:22:33,846 --> 01:22:34,915
It's okay.

763
01:22:35,926 --> 01:22:37,325
It's coming back!

764
01:22:41,005 --> 01:22:41,881
Dad!

765
01:22:43,965 --> 01:22:45,000
Thank you.

766
01:22:57,364 --> 01:22:59,639
Don't go into the long grass!

767
01:23:05,084 --> 01:23:07,314
Not into the long grass!

768
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,194
Look at this.

769
01:24:09,599 --> 01:24:11,829
- What is it?
- I think it's Ajay's bag.

770
01:24:27,478 --> 01:24:29,946
Go, as fast as you can.

771
01:24:31,478 --> 01:24:32,354
Go!

772
01:25:02,916 --> 01:25:04,554
I see structures there.

773
01:25:05,636 --> 01:25:09,150
They said the communications centre
is in the operations building.

774
01:25:09,235 --> 01:25:12,625
I'll get in there and send the radio call.
See you there.

775
01:25:12,915 --> 01:25:14,507
- Wait for us.
- Every second counts.

776
01:25:14,595 --> 01:25:16,665
If you can keep up, you're welcome to try.

777
01:25:16,755 --> 01:25:19,110
- Okay, here we come.
- No! Rest.

778
01:27:17,387 --> 01:27:18,342
Damn it!

779
01:27:23,946 --> 01:27:27,700
CQ, this is InGen Operations
Harvest Leader to Harvest Base.

780
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:30,738
Repeating, I'm calling
for InGen Harvest Leader...

781
01:27:30,906 --> 01:27:34,342
<i>- ... seeking InGen Harvest Base.
- Go ahead, Harvest Leader.</i>

782
01:27:34,466 --> 01:27:36,899
The operation has suffered
severe casualties.

783
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:41,137
The survivors are now in mortal danger.
I need you to send rescue immediately.

784
01:27:41,305 --> 01:27:43,694
Our co-ordinates here are...

785
01:27:44,025 --> 01:27:48,018
...9° 58' north, 85°...

786
01:29:18,619 --> 01:29:19,734
Here, here!

787
01:29:21,258 --> 01:29:22,611
Inside! Anywhere!

788
01:31:22,810 --> 01:31:23,879
Go.

789
01:31:24,090 --> 01:31:27,002
- Where do I go when I'm out?
- I'm right behind you-

790
01:31:52,928 --> 01:31:53,963
Look out!

791
01:31:57,648 --> 01:31:58,922
Up here!

792
01:32:23,126 --> 01:32:24,115
Hey, you!

793
01:32:44,005 --> 01:32:45,882
The school cut you from the team?

794
01:32:45,965 --> 01:32:47,284
Get out of here!

795
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:07,752
Come on. Let's go!

796
01:34:10,439 --> 01:34:12,236
Let's go!

797
01:34:34,477 --> 01:34:37,628
- What about the other survivors?
- Another chopper's coming.

798
01:34:56,076 --> 01:34:57,634
It's okay. It's over.

799
01:34:59,796 --> 01:35:02,673
That's one souvenir
they won't be taking with them.

800
01:35:11,115 --> 01:35:12,946
Find the infant tyrannosaur.

801
01:35:13,115 --> 01:35:16,152
Roland knows where the nest is.
I want it on my jet.

802
01:35:16,634 --> 01:35:19,626
I'll take it directly to the infirmary
in San Diego.

803
01:35:20,274 --> 01:35:23,630
Hurry. I want to be airborne
before the female knows.

804
01:35:31,193 --> 01:35:32,865
You probably saved InGen.

805
01:35:33,073 --> 01:35:35,428
We lost everything
we came after on this trip.

806
01:35:35,513 --> 01:35:38,505
But this animal
and its infant will bail us out.

807
01:35:38,793 --> 01:35:40,112
Congratulations.

808
01:35:40,673 --> 01:35:42,311
You've got your trophy!

809
01:35:42,713 --> 01:35:43,748
A buck.

810
01:35:44,553 --> 01:35:48,864
But it's alive! Everyone will line up
and appreciate it and what you did for us.

811
01:35:50,792 --> 01:35:52,191
What's the matter?

812
01:35:52,432 --> 01:35:54,388
He didn't make it. Ajay.

813
01:35:55,672 --> 01:35:56,866
I'm sorry.

814
01:35:57,872 --> 01:35:59,430
Really, I am.

815
01:36:03,151 --> 01:36:05,221
I remember the people who help me.

816
01:36:05,431 --> 01:36:08,025
There's a job for you in San Diego,
if you want it.

817
01:36:08,111 --> 01:36:09,305
No, thank you.

818
01:36:11,591 --> 01:36:14,230
I've spent enough time
in the company of death.

819
01:36:27,550 --> 01:36:28,619
Oh, my God.

820
01:37:27,226 --> 01:37:29,739
<i>Fifteen years ago,
John Hammond had a dream.</i>

821
01:37:30,425 --> 01:37:34,657
<i>Like John himself, the dream was grand.
It was outsized. It was bold.</i>

822
01:37:34,865 --> 01:37:37,743
<i>It was impractical. It was not to be.</i>

823
01:37:38,425 --> 01:37:39,983
Half an hour from now...

824
01:37:40,185 --> 01:37:43,382
...John Hammond's dream,
re-imagined, will come true.

825
01:37:44,305 --> 01:37:48,058
For.01 of the cost
of building a destination resort...

826
01:37:49,064 --> 01:37:50,782
Is this the Ludlow affair?

827
01:37:50,864 --> 01:37:52,855
- This is private property.
- We're on the list.

828
01:37:52,944 --> 01:37:54,457
Turn around, get back in your car.

829
01:37:54,544 --> 01:37:58,093
- This is Dr. Harding, I'm Dr. Malcolm.
- We have Mr. Ludlow's test results.

830
01:37:58,384 --> 01:37:59,862
There's good and bad news.

831
01:38:00,143 --> 01:38:02,703
Tonight we will christen
Jurassic Park, San Diego...

832
01:38:02,783 --> 01:38:05,820
...a mega-attraction
that will drive turnstile numbers...

833
01:38:05,903 --> 01:38:08,258
...to rival any theme park in the world.

834
01:38:12,063 --> 01:38:16,021
I want to thank each one of you for coming
in these wee small hours of the morning.

835
01:38:17,422 --> 01:38:19,890
- The ship is here.
- It's early?

836
01:38:21,222 --> 01:38:22,701
You better come now.

837
01:38:24,622 --> 01:38:25,975
It's so exciting!

838
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:30,290
- See that couple?
- Sir, you need to look at this.

839
01:38:30,381 --> 01:38:32,133
Let them see this up close.

840
01:38:35,221 --> 01:38:37,610
I need a direct line to the Coast Guard.

841
01:38:38,581 --> 01:38:41,891
Look. That's their transponder signal,
Venture 5888.

842
01:38:42,621 --> 01:38:45,657
- They're coming in, but I can't raise them.
- Try again.

843
01:38:46,580 --> 01:38:50,698
Skipper, SS Venture, this is InGen
Harbour Master. Do you copy? Over.

844
01:38:53,140 --> 01:38:56,689
Skipper, SS Venture, you are approaching
the breakwater at flank speed.

845
01:38:56,780 --> 01:38:58,213
Reduce at once. Over.

846
01:39:12,459 --> 01:39:14,733
SS Venture, reduce your speed at once.

847
01:39:14,818 --> 01:39:19,096
SS Venture, this is InGen Harbour Master.
You are entering a docking area.

848
01:39:19,898 --> 01:39:21,650
What's everybody looking at?

849
01:39:26,058 --> 01:39:27,650
We should've stayed in the car.

850
01:40:18,254 --> 01:40:21,212
- You okay, Mr. Ludlow?
- I don't know. How do I look?

851
01:40:52,572 --> 01:40:54,528
- Oh, my God.
- Where's the crew?

852
01:40:56,492 --> 01:40:57,924
All over the place.

853
01:41:08,171 --> 01:41:09,650
I smell a fuel leak!

854
01:41:45,248 --> 01:41:46,727
Check the cargo hold!

855
01:41:47,288 --> 01:41:50,598
- There may be crew down there.
- Everybody off the boat!

856
01:41:58,327 --> 01:41:59,965
No! Get away from that!

857
01:42:32,405 --> 01:42:34,043
Now you're John Hammond.

858
01:43:03,203 --> 01:43:07,242
- Why wasn't it tranquillised?
- It was hit it with two darts of Carfentanil.

859
01:43:07,323 --> 01:43:09,712
- It was over 10 milligrams.
- That'd put it in a coma.

860
01:43:09,803 --> 01:43:12,521
It stopped breathing.
We gave it naltrexone to counteract.

861
01:43:12,602 --> 01:43:13,717
But we didn't know how much.

862
01:43:13,802 --> 01:43:16,316
You gave an antagonist
without knowing the dosage?

863
01:43:16,402 --> 01:43:19,155
You put it in a narcoleptic state.
It's a locomotive now.

864
01:43:19,242 --> 01:43:22,040
- We're prepared here.
- Any more dinosaurs on the boat?

865
01:43:22,122 --> 01:43:25,432
No, the infant was flown in.
We had this to tranquillise it.

866
01:43:30,121 --> 01:43:31,759
Do you have the infant?

867
01:43:33,481 --> 01:43:34,596
It's safe.

868
01:43:38,521 --> 01:43:41,432
The animal's dehydrated.
First, it'll go to a water source...

869
01:43:41,520 --> 01:43:44,159
...then look for the next thing
its body needs.

870
01:43:44,280 --> 01:43:48,239
All the containment equipment is here.
We must get it back to the boat.

871
01:43:48,320 --> 01:43:49,912
I know what you're gonna say.

872
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,434
When we brought the baby to the trailer,
it came.

873
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:55,795
There's no reason why it won't do
the same thing here.

874
01:44:00,319 --> 01:44:01,752
Where's the infant?

875
01:44:04,759 --> 01:44:06,750
In a secured facility. Why?

876
01:44:09,998 --> 01:44:11,511
Where's the facility?

877
01:45:32,833 --> 01:45:34,949
There's a dinosaur in our backyard.

878
01:45:41,232 --> 01:45:43,109
Benjamin, what are you doing?

879
01:45:43,312 --> 01:45:44,745
What are you doing?

880
01:45:45,552 --> 01:45:46,382
What?

881
01:45:47,632 --> 01:45:50,146
Come on. There's a dinosaur
in our backyard.

882
01:45:50,632 --> 01:45:53,100
The problem is, you need to read to him.

883
01:45:55,111 --> 01:45:57,671
If you serve him dinner,
he won't be up all night.

884
01:45:57,751 --> 01:45:59,423
It's the stupid fish tank!

885
01:45:59,511 --> 01:46:01,900
He needs a proper nightlight.

886
01:46:01,991 --> 01:46:05,063
- It may as well be daytime.
- Just turn it off.

887
01:46:25,869 --> 01:46:27,746
Slow down. Slow it down!

888
01:46:50,868 --> 01:46:52,017
There it is.

889
01:46:58,627 --> 01:46:59,821
He's sedated.

890
01:47:01,947 --> 01:47:05,178
Really heavily. Give me a hand.

891
01:47:08,386 --> 01:47:12,379
When the adult sees us again
with his baby, isn't he going to be like:

892
01:47:12,466 --> 01:47:13,501
" You!"

893
01:47:14,626 --> 01:47:17,982
There may be some angry recognition.

894
01:47:19,466 --> 01:47:22,264
Who knows?
He may be just happy to see us.

895
01:47:23,065 --> 01:47:24,976
What the hell are you doing?

896
01:47:26,585 --> 01:47:28,098
We're taking the kid.

897
01:47:28,945 --> 01:47:31,618
If you really want to stop us, shoot us.

898
01:47:33,425 --> 01:47:36,383
- How will we find the adult?
- Follow the screams.

899
01:48:53,859 --> 01:48:55,656
- There.
- Oh, my God.

900
01:49:09,018 --> 01:49:10,087
It's too drugged.

901
01:49:10,178 --> 01:49:12,772
He won't know we have it
unless it makes some sound!

902
01:49:12,858 --> 01:49:15,053
Wake up. Come on.

903
01:49:22,777 --> 01:49:23,812
He knows.

904
01:49:39,096 --> 01:49:40,893
Ian, slow down a little.

905
01:49:42,936 --> 01:49:44,289
I don't think so.

906
01:50:03,695 --> 01:50:07,050
This guy's almost fully awake.
You know where you're going?

907
01:50:08,174 --> 01:50:10,847
The waterfront's on the other side
of these warehouses.

908
01:50:10,934 --> 01:50:13,971
- Is there a way through?
- There could be.

909
01:50:19,894 --> 01:50:21,008
There we go.

910
01:50:23,773 --> 01:50:25,491
You have to follow me now.

911
01:50:25,573 --> 01:50:26,767
There we go.

912
01:50:27,613 --> 01:50:29,092
- Got him?
- Yep.

913
01:50:30,853 --> 01:50:33,811
- Ready?
- Where's the Rex? Is it still behind us?

914
01:50:41,732 --> 01:50:42,881
There's the water.

915
01:50:42,972 --> 01:50:45,486
Shoot it. Tell them to shoot it.

916
01:50:49,972 --> 01:50:54,283
No, you idiot, the adult. Shoot the adult.
I want the baby back alive.

917
01:51:25,849 --> 01:51:28,204
What have you done with it?
I want that infant!

918
01:51:58,687 --> 01:51:59,961
Are you there?

919
01:52:29,485 --> 01:52:30,804
There you are.

920
01:54:55,595 --> 01:54:58,746
<i>There's a first-rate shot
of the deck of the ship...</i>

921
01:54:58,995 --> 01:55:01,589
<i>...and the cargo hold that,
for the moment...</i>

922
01:55:01,675 --> 01:55:05,667
<i>...contains the animal itself,
presumably with the infant alongside.</i>

923
01:55:06,194 --> 01:55:10,631
<i>By our calculations, they are nearing
the halfway point of this trip.</i>

924
01:55:10,714 --> 01:55:12,784
<i>Jim, can you hear me there?</i>

925
01:55:13,434 --> 01:55:16,346
<i>Yes, I can, Bernard.
We are halfway to the island.</i>

926
01:55:16,434 --> 01:55:19,630
<i>It is 206 nautical miles
from our present location.</i>

927
01:55:19,713 --> 01:55:21,510
<i>The ship is moving at 20 knots...</i>

928
01:55:21,593 --> 01:55:24,744
<i>...which will put it in at about 11:30 a. m.,
Eastern time.</i>

929
01:55:24,833 --> 01:55:28,109
<i>One of the Navy's primary concerns
has been safety.</i>

930
01:55:28,313 --> 01:55:31,464
<i>If we look at the ever-growing escort
around the ship...</i>

931
01:55:31,633 --> 01:55:35,261
<i>...they're taking no chances of a repeat
of the San Diego incident.</i>

932
01:55:35,832 --> 01:55:38,869
<i>Let's take a moment to run the tape...</i>

933
01:55:38,952 --> 01:55:41,864
<i>...of our interview earlier today
with John Hammond.</i>

934
01:55:42,032 --> 01:55:44,865
<i>He's the former head
of InGen BioEngineering...</i>

935
01:55:44,992 --> 01:55:47,630
<i>...the man who is now spearheading
this movement...</i>

936
01:55:47,711 --> 01:55:50,271
<i>...not only to return the animals
to their island...</i>

937
01:55:50,351 --> 01:55:52,865
<i>...but to keep the island itself intact.</i>

938
01:55:53,871 --> 01:55:56,829
<i>It is absolutely imperative...</i>

939
01:55:57,471 --> 01:56:01,543
<i>...that we work with the Costa Rican
Department of Biological Preserves...</i>

940
01:56:01,630 --> 01:56:03,700
<i>...to establish a set of rules...</i>

941
01:56:04,270 --> 01:56:07,979
<i>...for the preservation and isolation
of that island.</i>

942
01:56:09,310 --> 01:56:15,101
<i>These creatures require our absence
to survive, not our help.</i>

943
01:56:16,070 --> 01:56:19,106
<i>And if we could only step aside...</i>

944
01:56:20,909 --> 01:56:22,581
<i>...and trust in nature...</i>

945
01:56:23,669 --> 01:56:25,978
<i>...life will find a way.</i>
