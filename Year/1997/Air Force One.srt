1
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,320
<i>Check. Head count.
Head count. Two. Three.</i>

2
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,800
<i>Four. Five.</i>

3
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,200
<i>Six.</i>

4
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,760
<i>Demo set.</i>

5
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,040
Let's move.

6
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,200
Clear.

7
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,480
<i>Low Boy, this is Black Cat.</i>

8
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,200
<i>ETA Romeo, L-Z-one-niner.</i>

9
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,760
<i>We are hot. Copy.</i>

10
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,320
Come on. Get out there!
Go, go!

11
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,160
Come on.

12
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,840
Get in!

13
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,800
Cover! I'm on the roof!

14
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,800
Go!

15
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,240
<i>This is Low Boy.
Package is wrapped.</i>

16
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,360
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

17
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,160
<i>three weeks ago,
Russian and American special forces...</i>

18
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,080
<i>apprehended the self-proclaimed leader
of Kazakhstan...</i>

19
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,440
<i>General Ivan Radek.</i>

20
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,800
<i>The forces of Radek were directed
toward the suppression of democracy.</i>

21
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,360
<i>His nuclear arsenal
could have brought the world...</i>

22
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,000
<i>into a new cold war.</i>

23
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,600
<i>But thanks to the support of one
of the world's greatest leaders...</i>

24
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,840
<i>Radek is now in prison.</i>

25
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,760
<i>Today we are honoring this brave man.</i>

26
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,400
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
my friend...</i>

27
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,760
<i>the president of the
United States of America.</i>

28
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,640
<i>The dead remember our indifference.</i>

29
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,960
<i>The dead remember our silence.</i>

30
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,280
I came here tonight
to be congratulated.

31
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,720
But today when I visited
the Red Cross camps...

32
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,000
overwhelmed by the flood of refugees...

33
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,400
fleeing from the horror
of Kazakhstan...

34
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,880
I realized I don't deserve
to be congratulated, none of us do.

35
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,280
-What's he doing?
-That's not the speech.

36
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,680
The truth is...

37
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,040
we acted too late.

38
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,400
Only when our own national security
was threatened did we act.

39
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,320
Radek's regime murdered over 200,000
men, women and children...

40
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,240
and we watched it on TV.

41
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,280
We let it happen.
People were being slaughtered...

42
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,560
for over a year.

43
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,280
We issued economic sanctions and hid
behind the rhetoric of diplomacy.

44
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,680
How dare we?

45
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,920
The dead remember.

46
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,320
Real peace...

47
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,120
is not just the absence of conflict,
it's the presence of justice.

48
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,520
Tonight I come to you with a pledge
to change America's policy.

49
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,680
Never again...

50
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,280
will I allow
our political self-interest...

51
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,440
to deter us from doing what we know
to be morally right.

52
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,760
Atrocity and terror
are not political weapons.

53
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,760
And to those who would use them...

54
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,320
your day is over.

55
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,720
We will never negotiate.

56
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,240
We will no longer tolerate
and we will no longer be afraid.

57
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,160
It's your turn to be afraid.

58
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,120
The Russian was a nice touch.

59
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,480
Tell my mother.
She wanted me to study French.

60
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,160
-Do you know what you committed us to?
-I know exactly what I committed us to.

61
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,480
Gentlemen,
welcome to "Air Force One."

62
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,000
Please present your equipment
for inspection.

63
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,400
We were just inspected at the gate.

64
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,840
This plane carries the president
of the United States.

65
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,760
I understand. I'm terribly sorry.

66
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,080
Please place your thumb
on the I.D. pad.

67
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,160
<i>Access cleared.</i>

68
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,720
Hello. I'm Melanie Mitchell,
deputy press secretary.

69
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,120
-I'll be taking you in from here.
-Oh, Miss Mitchell.

70
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,360
It is so nice to finally meet you
in person.

71
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,600
The president and I were delighted
we could accommodate your news crew.

72
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,920
So, if you boys are all cleared?

73
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,160
The president's on a very tight schedule
so this is how it works.

74
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,080
During the flight,
two members of your crew...

75
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,240
will be allowed outside the press area
for filming.

76
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
You'll get exactly 10 minutes
with the president, 20 with the crew.

77
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,160
Gary, the president is ready
to take Congress on.

78
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,880
He's not gonna kiss their ass
for each vote.

79
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,120
Let them vote us down
and stand on their record.

80
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,440
Yeah, I'm with him now.
I'll call you from the plane.

81
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,800
-What did they say about the speech?
-Your speech is leading the news.

82
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,720
They're calling it
the "Be Afraid" speech.

83
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,120
Good.

84
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,160
With all due respect,
next time you want to make...

85
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,200
a major policy departure,
you might want to discuss it...

86
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,000
with your national security advisor
first.

87
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,680
-We did discuss it, Jack.
-We discussed it...

88
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,080
in private, which is where I thought
it would remain.

89
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,960
Now it's public.
Now it's policy.

90
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,600
Get behind it.

91
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,320
The allies are going to be very upset
they weren't consulted about this.

92
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,560
It might come back and bite us
in the ass in November.

93
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,880
It's the right thing to do.

94
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,360
You know it.

95
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,000
There goes the neighborhood.

96
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,680
If you'd like,
we have time for a quick tour.

97
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,600
-We'd be delighted.
-Good.

98
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,240
Andrei, Boris.

99
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,920
Follow me.

100
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,160
Ahead of this staff cabin
is Secret Service. Right here.

101
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,760
Never try to go past them without
an escort or you'll be very sorry.

102
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,880
-Hello.
-Hi.

103
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,440
Thanks for the warning.

104
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,680
Here we have
our in-flight offices.

105
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,680
A lot of the plane's features
are classified.

106
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,040
But I can tell you
it's bullet-resistant...

107
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,520
and it's even protected against
the pulse of a nuclear blast.

108
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,680
I'm not sure that's very comforting.

109
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,800
Upstairs is the cockpit along with the
most advanced communications center...

110
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,400
on or above the face of the earth.

111
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,200
We could run the whole country
from here.

112
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,280
Or even a war if we had to.

113
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,200
Just last week, the president called
the shuttle astronauts from there.

114
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,320
The president's arriving.
They should take their seats.

115
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,800
Right away.

116
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,360
I'll get out of here and let you all
get some sleep.

117
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,560
-Mr. President, welcome aboard.
-Hey, Danny. How are you?

118
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,080
Mr. President!

119
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,600
Change in plan, Danny.
Let's go to Barbados.

120
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,480
Anything you want.
You're the president.

121
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,040
Boy, I wish.

122
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,320
-Mr. President.
-Mr. Gibbs, where's my bunch?

123
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,560
Ballet ran late.
They'll be here in five minutes.

124
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,560
-Lewis, you tape the game?
-It was a real squeaker, sir.

125
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,840
Don't brief me on it.
I wanted to watch it, for Christ's sake.

126
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,560
We'll be underway
in about 30 minutes, sir.

127
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,520
Mr. President.

128
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,960
Could you put the game on now?
Yeah, Jack?

129
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
The Iraqis have mobilized
two armored brigades toward...

130
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,440
Just got it. Give me 15 minutes.
Get the guys together.

131
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,640
"Repel them.
Make them relinquish the ball."

132
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,480
-Did you hear about Notre Dame?
-Don't. Don't tell me the score.

133
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,280
-Great game.
-Mr. President.

134
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,680
We need to strategize,
smooth some things out politically.

135
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,600
-What was that?
-It's not so important.

136
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,080
-Damage control. What if...
-Give me a minute alone.

137
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,480
What if a "high-ranking
White House official"...

138
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,400
Just give me a few moments alone.

139
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,280
A "high-ranking official" were
to qualify what you said last night?

140
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,680
Drop it. Do yourself a favor.

141
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,320
It's policy.
Drop it.

142
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,360
-Or find another ride home. Yeah?
-The Russian news crew's with us.

143
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,760
I told them you'd give them a sound bite
about life in the White House.

144
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,520
There is no life in the White House.

145
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,760
You said it.
The president needs some time alone.

146
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,320
14-13 Michigan!

147
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,640
All right, Mr. President!

148
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,040
That wasn't you napping
during the performance, was it, Tom?

149
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,520
No, ma'am. It was very enjoyable.

150
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,680
Alice, you can finish it on the plane.
Let's not keep your father waiting.

151
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,840
Try and smile, sweetheart. Okay?

152
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,280
-Alice, one picture, please!
-Thank you very much.

153
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,280
Great, something from Tom.

154
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,240
Shh. Daddy's asleep.

155
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,680
How was the ballet?

156
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,000
It was great!

157
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,840
You trying to kill me?
Wait it really good? Did you enjoy it?

158
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,600
Did you love it? Men in tights?
Did you hear my speech?

159
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,640
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

160
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,960
-You're gonna get yourself reelected.
-That's what I keep telling them.

161
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,280
<i>This is the aircraft commander.
We'll take to the runway in a moment.</i>

162
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,240
-Are you guys comfortable?
-Yes, very.

163
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,240
-I brought you V.I.P. press kits.
-Thank you.

164
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,680
You're welcome.

165
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,120
Pass interference.
That's cheating.

166
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,080
-Only if they get caught.
-Dad!

167
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,040
The way of the world, kiddo.

168
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,080
Why didn't you take me with you
when you went to the refugee camp today?

169
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,800
For one thing,
it's not 100 percent secure.

170
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,800
You've got your whole life to live.
You don't need to see that stuff.

171
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,640
Come on, Dad. It's not like
I don't see it on the news.

172
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,600
It's different on the news.

173
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,280
All I'm saying is I'm ready for things
you don't think I'm ready for.

174
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,360
Maybe I'm not ready.

175
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,400
I'm 12 years old, Dad!
In the caveman days...

176
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,680
I'd be having children of my own.

177
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,560
That's what we call progress. You're
missing the best part of the game.

178
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,120
God!

179
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,280
We're so looking forward to seeing you.

180
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,280
-She is so anxious to grow up.
-I know. She's...

181
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,440
Yes, the both of us.

182
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,520
Okay. Bye, bye.

183
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,600
Well, she couldn't stay
your little girl forever, Jim.

184
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,000
I was hoping it would last
till she was 14 or 15.

185
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,680
Or 50.

186
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,960
They hated your speech, didn't they?

187
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,440
They're afraid we won't have the guts
to back it up.

188
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,360
And, then, if we do,
it'll be political suicide.

189
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,920
Remember our first campaign?

190
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,880
-In the House?
-Yeah.

191
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,200
-Downstate, driving around with...
-Who was that kid, our volunteer?

192
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,640
-Henry.
-Henry with the convertible.

193
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,200
-With the broken top.
-And the snow coming in.

194
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,240
We were the only three people
who thought you could win that.

195
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,760
You didn't give a damn. You knew
what needed to be done and you did it.

196
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,840
And you spoke from your heart.
That's what I heard tonight.

197
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:59,480
Well, it felt good.

198
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,760
I'll bet it did.

199
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,200
Sorry to interrupt.
Everybody's assembled, sir.

200
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,240
<i>United States "Air Force One."</i>

201
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,480
<i>It is an honor to clear you
for immediate takeoff on runway 2-5.</i>

202
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,600
"Air Force One" cleared for takeoff.

203
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
Thank you for your hospitality, Moscow.

204
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,800
<i>In Moscow tonight,
President Marshall defended...</i>

205
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,120
<i>the military action
against the Radek regime...</i>

206
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,480
<i>an act the administration had
been calling a one-time intervention.</i>

207
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,400
<i>But in a rare display of emotion...</i>

208
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,080
<i>the president alluded to a change
in U.S. foreign policy when he stated...</i>

209
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,440
<i>that America will no longer tolerate
any terrorist government.</i>

210
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,280
<i>Meanwhile in Kazakhstan, Radek's ouster
stalled the neo-communist revolution.</i>

211
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,160
These are two of Saddam Hussein's
Republican Guard brigades...

212
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,880
that have been moved north.

213
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,080
He knows we're watching,
knows we'll retaliate.

214
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,320
Why the hell is he sending tanks
to the border?

215
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,040
Could be a response to your speech,
Mr. President.

216
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,080
-Maybe he's got a son-in-law up there.
-Very funny.

217
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,640
I think there's one or two
he hasn't shot yet.

218
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,600
What does State have to say?

219
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,800
The Iraqi ambassador is claiming
it's just an exercise.

220
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,440
Let's not waste more time.
Send the "Nimitz" back in.

221
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,200
-Gibbs.
-Guys.

222
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,120
-Sleeping on the job?
-No, sir.

223
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,080
Hey, guys...

224
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,920
these are the advance team reports
from the Miami field agent.

225
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,200
-Take a look at them.
-Thank you.

226
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,200
Smoke.
There's smoke!

227
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,280
Steward, there's smoke in the cabin.

228
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,200
Everybody move to the back of the plane.
Now! Please!

229
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,800
Smoke! Notify the cockpit!

230
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,200
Mr. President, stay back.

231
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,880
Everybody down!

232
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,600
Code red! We have a code red!
I repeat. Shots fired on board.

233
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,480
Code red acknowledged.
Lock that door now.

234
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,760
Flight control, this is "Air Force One"
declaring emergency.

235
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,920
Cover us!

236
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,360
Stay back.

237
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,720
Move up!
I'll cover you.

238
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,760
Go! Go!

239
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,560
-What's going on?
-Shots fired, sir.

240
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,200
-What about my family?
-We're handling it, sir.

241
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,560
Boy Scout coming out!
Cover!

242
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,320
-Give us cover!
-Daddy?

243
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,800
Alice, get back!

244
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,680
Alice, get down!

245
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,160
-Take him around here.
-Get down.

246
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,640
This is "Air Force One."

247
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,200
We are code red.
Shots fired on board.

248
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,040
Request emergency assistance.
ETA 15 minutes.

249
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,720
Acknowledged. We are scrambling
our fighters. Emergency equipment...

250
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,720
<i>will be standing by.</i>

251
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,040
Get him to the escape pod!

252
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,840
Boy Scout is headed to the vault.

253
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,640
The football!
The football!

254
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,720
Get him around here.

255
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,440
Get him down to the pod!

256
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,920
Don't move!

257
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,120
-They're on us.
-Where's my family?

258
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,600
-Get in the pod, sir. Get in!
-What about my family?

259
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,360
"Air Force One," landing runway 0-9.
I repeat, runway 0-9.

260
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,760
<i>Roger. Turning to heading 1-8-5.
Descending to 5,000 feet.</i>

261
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,000
<i>Ramstein, this is "Air Force One."</i>

262
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,600
<i>Emergency pod has been deployed.
I repeat.</i>

263
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,280
<i>-The emergency pod has been deployed.
-Ramstein tower, acknowledge.</i>

264
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,880
We are picking up the homing beacon
and deploying search and rescue.

265
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,800
-Is the locking ready to look at?
-Just about, sir.

266
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,200
-Has General Northwood arrived?
-Yes, he has.

267
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,800
-Give me an update.
-Madam Vice President, this way.

268
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,120
-We'll avoid the press.
-Is the president secure?

269
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,160
Not yet. The recovery team
will have him very soon.

270
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,440
<i>"Air Force One"...</i>

271
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,880
<i>this is Halo Flight Lead,:
you are under escort.</i>

272
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,160
<i>All airspace has been cleared.
Alert force has been mobilized.</i>

273
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,120
-Is everyone here?
-We're working on it.

274
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,880
How did this happen?
How did they get "Air Force One"?

275
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,200
Gentlemen. Mr. Secretary.

276
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,040
<i>Ramstein tower, we are at ten mile...</i>

277
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,320
<i>Final coming in red hot.</i>

278
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,640
Roger, "Air Force One." Wind is
0-niner-0 at 1-2. You are clear to land.

279
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,640
Get down! Now!

280
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,480
Open the door!

281
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,720
Open!
Open the door!

282
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,960
No matter what happens, we land
this aircraft. Is that understood?

283
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,560
Come on. Flaps 30.

284
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,320
Flaps 30.

285
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,440
-No!
-Get the fuck in the air!

286
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,360
Now!
Take this plane up!

287
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,680
Up! Up!

288
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,960
-Get us back in the air now!
-Artie!

289
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Take it up!

290
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,800
Get this plane back in the air now
or you die.

291
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,440
Get up now!

292
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,000
No! Jesus!

293
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,480
Contact those F-15s.

294
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,480
I want them to keep "Air Force One"
in visual contact.

295
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,520
-What are our airborne scenarios?
-There are no airborne scenarios.

296
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,080
Then we'd better start generating them.
They better be good and better work.

297
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,080
How long can they stay up there
with the fuel they have?

298
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,520
-That's a question of airspeed, wind.
-Altitude.

299
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,040
We need an "Air Force One" pilot. Any
educated guesses where they might go?

300
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,200
-Iraq, Libya, Algeria.
-Those are guesses, but not educated.

301
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,480
Notify our allies.
We'll need secure airspace.

302
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,400
-Can we keep that under wraps?
-We'll do our best.

303
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,960
Try and relax, Kathryn.
I'm in charge here.

304
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,640
I don't know.
It seems to me they're in charge.

305
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,240
-Don't hurt me.
-Go.

306
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,680
Go.

307
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,040
Moscow police found six members
of a Russian TV news crew murdered.

308
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,920
The same crew that was cleared
to fly on "Air Force One."

309
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,640
Tell me it's not that easy.

310
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,280
No. You would have to generate
fake I.D., photos.

311
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,560
-Fingerprints.
-Could be with help from Moscow.

312
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,280
How would they get weapons on board?

313
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,040
There's no way to get weapons on board
"Air Force One." It's impossible.

314
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,360
There are enough weapons on board to
take Panama, but who has access to them?

315
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,120
You think someone on the plane
helped them?

316
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,800
What if somebody did
and they're still on the plane?

317
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,800
Who do they trust up there?
Who do we trust?

318
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,800
Madam Vice President,
Mr. Secretary.

319
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,120
All compromised nuclear launch codes
have been cancelled.

320
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,080
New codes are active.

321
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,320
<i>Ramstein, the president's escape pod
has been located.</i>

322
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,840
<i>We're honing in at 2-8-5 degrees.</i>

323
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,920
<i>There it is.
Ramstein, we have a strong signal.</i>

324
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,360
ETA, two minutes.

325
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,120
Where is the wife and daughter?

326
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,200
Where is my husband?

327
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,160
He had fled.
The coward chose to save himself.

328
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,120
But one can always
strike a bargain.

329
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,560
You listen to me.

330
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,920
I don't know who you are
or what you want...

331
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,440
but you will never get it.

332
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,680
He will not negotiate.

333
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,760
Really?

334
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,440
His wife. His daughter.

335
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,720
A man could not live with himself.

336
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,720
And it would be such bad politics.

337
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,200
I think he'll negotiate.

338
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,680
The escape pod is visually acquired.

339
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,760
Location of Ramstein is 2-8-4 degrees.

340
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,760
Twelve miles out.

341
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,120
It's "Air Force One."
They want to talk to the vice president.

342
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,720
<i>Hello. Can you hear me?</i>

343
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,760
<i>This is the vice president
of the United States.</i>

344
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,760
<i>To whom am I speaking?</i>

345
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,680
<i>This is the person who controls
"Air Force One."</i>

346
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,200
The world's most secure aircraft.

347
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,600
What is it that you want?

348
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,240
We'll get to that.

349
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:11,880
<i>-I want to speak to the First Lady.
-No.</i>

350
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:15,520
<i>-No. Why?
-I need to know they're safe.</i>

351
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,200
The president is safe.

352
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,280
But then you must know that.

353
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,840
He ran from here like a whipped dog.

354
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:26,960
I'm sure you can't wait for him
to get back to making the decisions...

355
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,800
so you can stop sweating
through that silk blouse of yours.

356
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:38,480
What is the condition
of the people on board?

357
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,200
Some are dead.

358
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,640
What are your intentions?

359
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,520
What arrogance to think
you could ever understand my intentions.

360
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,920
I want to understand
what it is that you want.

361
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,840
What do I want?

362
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:59,360
When Mother Russia becomes
one great nation again...

363
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,760
when the capitalists are dragged
from the Kremlin...

364
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,640
and shot in the street...

365
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,480
when our enemies run and hide in fear
at the mention of our name...

366
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,000
and America begs our forgiveness...

367
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,320
on that great day of deliverance...

368
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,720
you will know what I want.

369
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,720
We can give you a forum
for your grievances.

370
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,040
<i>We can contact the Russian government.</i>

371
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,640
<i>But you must understand
that it will take some time.</i>

372
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,640
<i>Really?
When you talk to the president...</i>

373
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,720
you might remind him that I am holding
his wife, his daughter...

374
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,280
his chief of staff,
his national security advisor...

375
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,000
his classified papers
and his baseball glove.

376
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,200
If he wants them back, he will prevail
upon the puppet regime in Moscow...

377
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,240
<i>to release General Radek.</i>

378
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,200
<i>Fifty for one.</i>

379
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,760
It's a good deal.

380
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,200
How's your blouse?

381
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,760
What assurances do I have
that you'll keep your word?

382
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,320
I'll wait for confirmation that
General Radek has been released.

383
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,000
Until then...

384
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,840
I will execute a hostage
every half an hour.

385
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,400
<i>You have my word.</i>

386
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,160
You must understand that we...
Hello?

387
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,640
They're off!

388
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,920
Damn it!
Nobody does this...

389
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,840
to the United States.

390
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,280
The president will get back his glove
and play catch with this guy's balls.

391
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,080
We can't do anything in half an hour.
We need more time.

392
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,440
He's a zealot. Tough to negotiate with.
All you can do is wear them down.

393
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,880
Mr. Secretary!

394
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,600
We found the escape pod.

395
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,120
It's empty.

396
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,040
So where's the president?

397
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,560
I think we have to acknowledge
the possibility...

398
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,160
that the president
may be dead.

399
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,360
Why wouldn't they tell us?

400
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,960
Diversion.
Try to buy some time.

401
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,520
It could have happened in a cross fire,
and they're afraid we'll retaliate.

402
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,920
Damn right, we'll retaliate.
We'll release Radek into the atmosphere.

403
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,880
It doesn't add up. That terrorist knew
we'd recover the pod in short order.

404
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,920
He expected that we'd be talking
to Marshall.

405
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,440
Let's not bury him yet.
He could still be alive in that plane.

406
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:45,040
Let's not forget this president
is a Medal of Honor winner.

407
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,720
In Vietnam, he flew more helicopter
missions than any man in my command.

408
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,640
He knows how to fight.

409
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,040
Then he's taking a terrible chance
with his life.

410
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:56,680
The element of surprise
is a formidable advantage in combat.

411
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,560
If he's up there,
he's the best chance that we have.

412
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,040
That pod was designed
for a reason, General.

413
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,880
He has no right to take chances
with his life.

414
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,480
What does the psych profile say?
How far will he go?

415
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:10,360
He's a Radek loyalist. That tells us
all we need to know, doesn't it?

416
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,360
He'll see this thing through
to the last hostage or his own death.

417
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,080
Release this bastard
and Central Asia will go up in flames!

418
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,320
I'm aware of that.

419
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,680
Bring back the old Soviet empire
under a flag of genocide?

420
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,760
Radek with a nuclear arsenal?

421
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,800
I hate to say this,
but 50 people...

422
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,520
is a small price to pay
to stop that from happening.

423
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,160
Even if one of them is the president?

424
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,520
The presidency is bigger than any man.
Didn't they teach you that at Yale?

425
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,880
Can't we release him today
and pick up the pieces tomorrow?

426
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,520
We caught him before,
we'll catch him again.

427
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,960
If Petrov releases Radek,
his government will fall.

428
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,160
I promise you that.
Then who's gonna stand up to Radek?

429
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,400
You go to catch him again,
you'll find him in Moscow.

430
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:51,120
With respect, Mr. Secretary, we don't
need more dramatics, we need options.

431
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,040
-It's not an option.
-We need a decision.

432
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,880
It's not her decision.

433
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,440
This is a military situation.
I'm the secretary of defense.

434
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,200
Check your regs. In the absence
of the president, the buck stops here.

435
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,280
Get the attorney general
with a copy of the Constitution.

436
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,480
We have... Oh, my God!
Nineteen minutes.

437
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,400
I'm going to consult
with President Petrov.

438
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,680
<i>Madam Vice President, I'm sorry.
I cannot release him.</i>

439
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,160
<i>We would train...</i>

440
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,080
all our military might
against this one target.

441
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,120
<i>-He wouldn't stay at large for long.
-Maybe so.</i>

442
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,400
But millions of lives
are hanging in the balance.

443
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,320
I am trying to save a nation!

444
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,760
As am I.

445
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:35,600
No nation can survive the loss,
nor soon replace, a great leader.

446
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,480
Let us be pragmatic.
Fifty lives means nothing...

447
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,920
<i>in the grand scheme.</i>

448
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,640
Let me be equally pragmatic.

449
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,240
Our president took a great risk
to come to your aid...

450
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,920
against strong opposition
in both parties and among our allies.

451
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,240
It would be politically impossible
to do so again.

452
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,240
If it meant saving his life,
I would gladly do it.

453
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:54,200
<i>But I would have to know for sure.</i>

454
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,520
<i>And you cannot tell me he's alive,
can you?</i>

455
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,480
No, Mr. President, I cannot.

456
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:03,600
<i>Then there is nothing I can do.
I am truly sorry. Good-bye.</i>

457
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,000
Okay, Walter,
you and your generals get to work.

458
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,720
Okay, they can't keep the plane
in the air indefinitely.

459
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,120
There are only four possible
landing sites in Kazakhstan...

460
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,040
that are still controlled
by Radek's forces.

461
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,080
We have to go in and take all of them.
Can we do it?

462
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,080
I'd rather take my chances in the air.

463
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:08,520
I just looked at the airborne scenarios.
They're no good.

464
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,360
-Can we do this?
-In the time we have? Messy.

465
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,880
Three more minutes
before they execute the first hostage.

466
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,840
You'll have to buy us more time.

467
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,280
All right.

468
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,400
You both, come here.

469
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,520
Now!

470
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:18,640
They will transfer the call here.

471
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,120
So...

472
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,840
let's just wait.

473
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,720
Excuse me.

474
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,360
Sir, if you will permit me,
I am the national security advisor.

475
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,280
I'm the man the president
would be listening to.

476
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,440
I believe you are negotiating right now
with the vice president.

477
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,000
In our system, the vice president
is like the queen of England.

478
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,200
She can't even get airline tickets
without talking...

479
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:52,040
to somebody like me; therefore,
let me speak to the White House.

480
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,120
I promise you, I'm the one person
who can make this all work out.

481
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,840
Has he been released?

482
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,920
I've contacted the Russian government.
We've set things in motion.

483
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,040
But at this point,
we have to be realistic.

484
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,000
It's going to take more time.

485
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,320
More time?

486
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,560
Your national security advisor
has just been executed.

487
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,000
He's a very good negotiator.

488
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,360
<i>He bought you another half hour.</i>

489
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:40,720
Mrs. Marshall.

490
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,520
Alice.

491
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:46,600
If you please, come with me.

492
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,000
That's the first time
you ever seen a man killed, huh?

493
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,920
Leave her alone.

494
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,040
You think I'm a monster?

495
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,120
That I would kill this man?

496
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,560
Somebody's son?

497
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,920
Somebody's father?

498
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,600
I am somebody's son, too.

499
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:47,240
I have three small children.

500
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,520
Does that surprise you?

501
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,240
-Tell her to answer.
-Leave her alone!

502
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,480
Shut up!

503
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,720
Why did you kill him?

504
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,680
Because I believe.

505
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,360
And when I shoot this man,
I know in that instant...

506
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,440
how deep was my belief.

507
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:19,520
That I would turn my back
on God Himself...

508
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,560
for Mother Russia.

509
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,400
My doubts, my fears.

510
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,080
My own private morality.

511
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,600
It dissolve in this moment...

512
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,040
for this love.

513
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,680
You know, your father,
he has also killed.

514
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,800
-Is he a bad man?
-That's not true.

515
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,760
Why?

516
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,920
Because he does it in a tuxedo
with a telephone call and a smart bomb?

517
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,880
You are a monster.

518
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,280
And my father is a great man.

519
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,920
You're nothing like my father.

520
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,520
What's the goddamn number?

521
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,320
<i>-What city please?
-Washington D.C., the White House.</i>

522
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,800
<i>-Just a moment. Here's the number.
-Can you connect me to that number?</i>

523
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,320
<i>-There's a connect fee of one dollar.
-Fine.</i>

524
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,960
White House switchboard.
How may I direct your call?

525
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,320
All right, listen.
Listen carefully.

526
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,560
<i>This is an emergency call from
"Air Force One." This is the president.</i>

527
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:11,400
Connect me to the vice president.

528
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,200
<i>Who did you say is calling?</i>

529
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:19,600
<i>-This is the president!
-Right, and I'm the First Lady.</i>

530
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,560
Don't cut me off.
This is an emergency.

531
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,600
<i>The president doesn't call this
particular number, so whoever you are...</i>

532
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,760
Trace the call.

533
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,640
Follow your standard security procedure.

534
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,000
Trace the goddamn call!

535
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,960
Okay, sir. You want to make
a federal case out of this, fine by me!

536
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,720
Hello. Anyone there?

537
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,200
Don't move.

538
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,520
<i>-I traced the call, sir.
-Give me the gun.</i>

539
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,160
<i>-Are you there?
-Slowly.</i>

540
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,960
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

541
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,080
<i>I'll put you right through,
Mr. President.</i>

542
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,120
The switchboard has a call from someone
claiming to be the president.

543
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,120
She traced it back to
the White House satellite account.

544
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,160
The caller's gone,
but the line is still active.

545
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,120
Put it through.

546
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,720
<i>Listen to me.</i>

547
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:20,600
Listen to me.
You know who I am.

548
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,720
I'm the president of the United States.

549
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,320
-Yes!
-Quiet!

550
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:27,280
<i>Don't think that means
I don't shoot you.</i>

551
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,240
Put your hands behind your head
and move.

552
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,360
This is your lucky day.

553
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,320
What more can my people do?
Tell the F-15s to fire at the plane?

554
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,760
<i>Even if they tried, we're equipped
with tactical countermeasures.</i>

555
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,600
<i>-He's talking to us.
-What do you mean?</i>

556
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,920
<i>I just want you to feel secure.
That way no one will get hurt.</i>

557
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,560
<i>The computer will fly circles
around any missile they fire at us.</i>

558
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,480
<i>-And no hit, just a shock wave.
-He's telling us what to do.</i>

559
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,600
Believe me, all that would happen
is that we'd get knocked off our feet.

560
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,280
-That's all!
-Shut up!

561
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:06,600
My God! Is he saying
what I think he's saying?

562
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,760
-lf we're going to act, we must act now.
-It's too risky.

563
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,840
The president is up there
with a gun to his head.

564
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,480
He's asking us to do that
to "Air Force One"?

565
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,080
He's not asking.

566
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,840
Your commander in chief has issued
a direct order. Do it!

567
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,920
Are you sure that's what
you want me to do?

568
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,480
<i>You heard me. Let's pray it works
the way it's supposed to.</i>

569
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,440
Boys, give me room.

570
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,800
<i>I've been ordered to fire
on "Air Force One."</i>

571
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,240
I'm in position.
Missiles are armed.

572
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,400
The target is acquired.
I have a good lock.

573
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,320
God, I hope this works.
Fox Three.

574
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,920
This is Marshall.

575
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,120
<i>-Anyone there?
-We're here, Mr. President.</i>

576
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,920
Where's my family?
Are they safe?

577
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,360
The terrorists claim they're
holding them. We can't confirm.

578
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,800
<i>Who are they?</i>

579
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,040
What do they want?

580
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,480
They're Russian ultranationalist
radicals. They want General Radek...

581
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,560
<i>...released from prison.
-Radek?</i>

582
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,520
<i>-What are our tactical options?
-We're working on that, Mr. President</i>

583
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:17,440
<i>-But the bastards have us in a corner.
-There is no rescue attempt?</i>

584
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:20,800
<i>I ruled out a midair rescue. We can
do nothing while the plane's in the air.</i>

585
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:24,160
We gotta get this plane on the ground.
Take me off the speakerphone.

586
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,000
<i>-Where's Bennett?
-Mr. President.</i>

587
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,000
We cannot release Radek.

588
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:32,480
They're gonna shoot a hostage
every half hour until we do.

589
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:34,600
<i>I don't want a plane
full of dead people.</i>

590
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:38,200
Jim, they shot Jack Doherty.

591
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,360
Oh Christ!

592
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:45,280
We can't give in to their demands.
It won't end there.

593
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,760
If you die in the plane,
does it end there?

594
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:51,000
<i>Kathryn, we've got a job to do...
whatever the cost.</i>

595
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,960
-Mr. President, I--
-Kathryn...

596
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,440
...if you give a mouse a cookie--

597
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:01,200
He'll want a glass of milk.

598
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,080
We gotta get this plane
on the ground.

599
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:04,800
Get the plane on the ground.

600
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,320
I thought I'd ask you
to come and join us.

601
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,720
It is starting to feel
a little empty up here.

602
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,800
Sit down. Please.

603
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,920
Come.

604
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,000
<i>Tell me your name again...</i>

605
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,440
<i>for the record.</i>

606
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,120
<i>Melanie.</i>

607
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,680
Melanie Mitchell.

608
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,040
You travel often...

609
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,440
<i>with the President?</i>

610
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,680
<i>Yes.</i>

611
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:16,680
<i>So you know everyone on the plane?</i>

612
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,760
<i>Yes.</i>

613
01:02:21,160 --> 01:02:23,520
<i>I bet they like you, huh?</i>

614
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,760
You're a nice person, yes?

615
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,080
I guess so.

616
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,920
You are trembling.

617
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,720
Why are you afraid?

618
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:59,480
Because I don't wanna die.

619
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:04,720
Tell me...

620
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:08,040
<i>what am I doing at this moment?</i>

621
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,880
<i>You're pointing a gun at me.</i>

622
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,360
<i>Thank you, Melanie.</i>

623
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,800
This is to the secret service agent
in the baggage deck.

624
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,160
<i>I will count to ten.</i>

625
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,960
<i>And if you do not surrender,
this nice woman will die.</i>

626
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,320
One.

627
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,400
<i>-Please don't.
-Two.</i>

628
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:34,520
<i>-Don't do this!
-Three.</i>

629
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,200
<i>-Let me talk to him!
-Four.</i>

630
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:38,840
<i>-I beg you, please.
-Five.</i>

631
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:41,000
<i>Let me talk to the agent.</i>

632
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:43,240
<i>-Six.
-He might listen to me.</i>

633
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,440
Seven.

634
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,640
-I beg you, don't do this.
-Eight.

635
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,080
<i>-Don't do this, please!
-Nine!</i>

636
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,160
Oh, God.

637
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:13,880
<i>Let's think about that one
for a moment.</i>

638
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:17,560
And then we'll start again.

639
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,640
Next time...

640
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,240
I'll choose someone
more important.

641
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,400
I know what you are thinking,
First Lady.

642
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:47,080
You want me dead.

643
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,600
It may come to that.
In a war, people die.

644
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,600
This isn't war!

645
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,240
You just murdered
an unarmed woman.

646
01:04:56,320 --> 01:05:00,520
You, who murdered 100,000 Iraqis
to save a nickel on a gallon of gas...

647
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,600
are going to lecture me
about the rules of war?

648
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:04,880
Don't!

649
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,400
<i>Mr. President,
how can I help you?</i>

650
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:12,560
<i>Chief, you can help me
dump some fuel.</i>

651
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,960
Who's down there in the baggage deck?

652
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,840
-It's a secret service agent. Who?
-We have no idea.

653
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,400
Melanie was shot because one of your men
wouldn't show himself.

654
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,680
-I want to know who he is.
-We'd like to know ourselves.

655
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,640
Sir, it's someone
smart enough to know...

656
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,040
if you're hunting with one bullet,
you wait for a clean shot.

657
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,160
What are you saying?

658
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,760
Whoever that is down there,
he may be our only hope.

659
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:37,840
Our only hope is that Washington
complies with this bastard.

660
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,640
Because any minute now
another one of us is dead.

661
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,720
And you know what?

662
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,400
I'm afraid it might be me.

663
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,880
-Sir, do you see the maintenance panel?
-I see it.

664
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:57,080
Pop it open. There should be
a red switch. Toggle it up.

665
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,280
Hang on.

666
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:03,200
We got some indicator lights here.

667
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,160
To dump the fuel, you have to close
the circuit for the pump.

668
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:09,240
<i>There's no switch,
so you'll have to cross the wires.</i>

669
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:12,400
<i>-Open the fuel control door.
-Hang on.</i>

670
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,400
There should be five of them.

671
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,040
<i>-Do you see them, sir?
-I see them. Yeah.</i>

672
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:22,760
Jesus. There's a lot of goddamn wires.
All right, wait a second.

673
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,240
We got five.

674
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:27,280
Green, yellow, red, white and blue.

675
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:28,800
<i>Let me double-check.</i>

676
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,880
Come on. For Christ's sake, hurry up.

677
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,600
Get the wrong wire, you'll cut
the engine feeds. The plane will crash.

678
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:36,720
Then we don't want to get
the wrong wire, do we?

679
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,360
<i>Cut the green wire.</i>

680
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:43,880
Cut.

681
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:48,960
<i>-Then, cross the... With the...
-With the what?</i>

682
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:52,280
Hello? Cross it with the what?
Say again.

683
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:55,440
Cross the green wire with the...

684
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,760
For Christ's sake!

685
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,440
Wait, green...

686
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:04,920
yellow...

687
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:08,000
red, white and blue.

688
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,000
I'm counting on you,
red, white and blue.

689
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:33,520
Sirs, it looks like "Air Force One"
is losing fuel.

690
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:17,360
<i>Madam Vice President, the time has come
for you to demonstrate your good faith.</i>

691
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,720
<i>I've been reading through
your press kit.</i>

692
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:24,880
I understand "Air Force One"
is able to refuel in midair.

693
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,640
We need fuel.
And we need it now.

694
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,600
I'm sure we can come
to some sort of arrangement.

695
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:36,040
If you'll land the plane,
we'll trade fuel for hostages.

696
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:38,040
This is bullshit!

697
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:42,440
It's simple physics. Without fuel,
the plane crashes. Everybody dies.

698
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:44,720
We're trying to do everything
that we can.

699
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,880
Tell me what I want to hear, or I will
execute a member of the senior staff...

700
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,760
and continue killing one hostage
every minute...

701
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:56,640
until the plane crash
or refueling plane arrive!

702
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,680
What do you say?

703
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,440
Fuel's on its way.

704
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:07,960
Thank you.

705
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,600
Move.

706
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,240
-Jim, what are you doing here?
-I never left.

707
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:10,000
Watch the door.

708
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,560
Where's my family?

709
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:13,760
Another part of the plane.
We haven't seen them.

710
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:15,920
We got weapons now.
We should try to retake the plane.

711
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,160
Not while they've got Grace and Alice.
I can't take that chance.

712
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,240
What about trying to disable the plane
and force them to land?

713
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,920
I tried. I dumped some fuel.
Now they're gonna refuel us in midair.

714
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:28,760
A refueling tanker?
Jesus! Sir?

715
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:33,120
-There may be a way to get people off.
-What do you mean?

716
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:36,240
We have emergency parachutes
in the tail cone, but we're too high.

717
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:39,200
If we could get a message
to the refueling tanker...

718
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,320
get him to drop to 15,000 feet,
we could jump.

719
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,280
They've disabled the phones.
They control the radios.

720
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:49,440
-Mr. President? Sir? The fax machines.
-The phone lines are out.

721
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:53,520
No. Voice lines and faxes are on
two different systems of encryption.

722
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:56,040
If you disable one,
it'd be easy to overlook the other.

723
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,880
If this works, you get to be
postmaster general. Come with me.

724
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,840
-Get these people ready.
-Yes. Remember.

725
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:08,880
15,000 feet and 200 knots.
Otherwise it's suicide.

726
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,960
You'll need this.

727
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,320
Good luck, people.

728
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:27,080
-Where are we sending it?
-Situation Room.

729
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,400
It makes me so proud
that you stuck with us.

730
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:34,360
-Thanks.
-Whatever happens.

731
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,720
Yes!

732
01:13:21,880 --> 01:13:24,280
Madam Vice President,
the attorney general is here.

733
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:31,760
-Thank you for coming, Andrew.
-Good that you're here.

734
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,840
You want my interpretation of what the
Constitution says about the situation?

735
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:38,320
Yes. Andrew,
my understanding is...

736
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,400
that if the president is out of contact
in a military situation...

737
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,120
the secretary of defense
is in charge as second in command.

738
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:46,600
-Yes, of course.
-Good. Then that settles it.

739
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,640
It doesn't settle it at all.

740
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,800
The president is not merely out
of contact. He is also under duress.

741
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,280
His family is held hostage,
possibly himself a hostage.

742
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:01,040
It creates an incapacity to discharge
the office under the 25th amendment.

743
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:03,280
Surely just as if he'd had a stroke.

744
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:06,240
I think the president would dispute
that any incapacity exists.

745
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:11,080
It exists if a majority of the cabinet,
including yourself, says it exists.

746
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:15,000
The president may be alive,
but he may not be the president.

747
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,280
Madam Vice President?
I think you need to see this.

748
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,800
<i>This is CNN breaking news.</i>

749
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:25,320
<i>We interrupt programming to bring you
this breaking news bulletin.</i>

750
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:28,440
<i>CNN has received
unconfirmed reports...</i>

751
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,920
<i>that "Air Force One" has crashed.</i>

752
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,480
-Oh, my God! How did they get that?
-I don't know.

753
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,880
<i>The aircraft was en route from Moscow
when it began its Mayday hail.</i>

754
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,120
<i>I repeat.
We have unconfirmed reports...</i>

755
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,080
Call the press room.
We have to issue a statement.

756
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:43,920
<i>that the president's plane
has crashed in Eastern Europe.</i>

757
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,440
-Has "Air Force One" crashed?
-That is a rumor.

758
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:20,960
-Where'd the story come from?
-I don't know where it came from.

759
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:23,960
Listen.
I cannot confirm anything...

760
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,960
at this point.

761
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:33,880
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a statement.

762
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:40,720
The president's plane,
"Air Force One," has been hijacked.

763
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:45,000
Please.

764
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
please let me finish.

765
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:50,440
For security reasons,
I cannot divulge...

766
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,880
the identity of the hijackers
or who was on board the plane.

767
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,320
But I'm here to assure
the American people...

768
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,520
that we are doing everything we can
to resolve the situation.

769
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,000
For the safety of all the people
on the plane...

770
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:08,240
I cannot tell you any more than I have,
and I'm sure you understand that.

771
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,040
Is James Marshall still the president?

772
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:13,480
I'm coordinating with
the National Security Council...

773
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,560
pending the president's return.

774
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:17,560
And, yes, James Marshall
is still the president.

775
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,040
At this time...

776
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:26,400
At this time,
I would like to ask all Americans...

777
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:33,600
to pray for the safety of everyone
on board "Air Force One."

778
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:35,600
<i>Thank you.</i>

779
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,960
The president.

780
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:50,160
Where is the president?

781
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:34,480
Folks, listen up.
This is your main rip cord.

782
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,640
As soon as you clear the plane,
give it a yank.

783
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,600
If your chute doesn't open,
this is your reserve chute.

784
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,240
Pull it down. Clear?

785
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:06,120
<i>"Air Force One," do you read?</i>

786
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:09,080
Yes, we read. Go ahead.

787
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:11,880
<i>"Air Force One,"
this is "Extender 1-0."</i>

788
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:15,120
<i>-We have been instructed to refuel you.
-Go ahead.</i>

789
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:19,440
<i>Drop to 15,000 feet
and slow to 200 knots.</i>

790
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,080
Acknowledged. Two hundred.

791
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:28,640
-They got it!
-They got the fax.

792
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:31,080
Sir, your chute.

793
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:33,800
-Please, sir.
-I'm not leaving without my family.

794
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:38,440
<i>Okay, "Air Force One,"
you need to open your receptacle door.</i>

795
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:41,360
<i>Pull the yellow lever
on the upper control panel.</i>

796
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:43,360
Done.

797
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,040
<i>Go ahead and close distance
nice and easy.</i>

798
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:51,040
Almost there.

799
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:56,320
-Where are your chutes?
-We stay with the president, sir.

800
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,520
Thank you.

801
01:19:05,560 --> 01:19:09,000
All right, that's close enough.
Here we go!

802
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,080
Go! Go!

803
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:19,680
Go! Come on!

804
01:19:22,840 --> 01:19:25,440
Go! You, come on!

805
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,280
We got...

806
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,680
so far 25 chutes.

807
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,840
<i>-I can't hold her.
-What are you doing?</i>

808
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,320
<i>Break away! Break away!</i>

809
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,040
Sir, take my hand!

810
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,960
Everybody, break now!

811
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,520
-Don't move!
-Let me save him!

812
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,800
He's the president,
for God's sake!

813
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,000
Go get him!

814
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:26,440
Grab my hand!

815
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:29,800
Major!

816
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:35,640
I got you.

817
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,840
We've lost the tanker?
What else?

818
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,040
-They're counting 32 survivors.
-That means they still have hostages.

819
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,320
-What about the first family?
-No word yet.

820
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,480
Losing hostages will make
the terrorists more desperate.

821
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,880
Madam Vice President,
we've got "Air Force One" on the line.

822
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:05,560
This is Vice President Bennett.
We're listening.

823
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,560
<i>I now hold hostage...</i>

824
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,840
<i>the president of the United States
of America.</i>

825
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,760
<i>Soon we shall enter
the sovereign airspace of Kazakhstan.</i>

826
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,880
You will cease your military escort
at the border.

827
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,960
If you violate our airspace...

828
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:27,400
<i>I will execute a member
of the first family.</i>

829
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,680
Tell our fighters to back off.

830
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,840
Get me Ops.

831
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:41,200
You said a presidential incapacity
could be declared by a cabinet majority.

832
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,080
-Would you sign it?
-Under the circumstances.

833
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,160
See who else would.

834
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:57,040
Move! Come on, move!

835
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:03,080
Fast! Move! Quick! Right here.

836
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,320
-It'll be all right.
-I know.

837
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:34,920
You've been very busy downstairs.

838
01:23:36,160 --> 01:23:37,640
Haven't you?

839
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,760
Killing my men.

840
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:02,400
You don't wanna do that.

841
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,760
I'm what you came for.
Don't forget that.

842
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,360
Then I kill them.

843
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,120
Or just one.

844
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:13,240
You pick.

845
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:16,960
That's what you do in the White House.
You play God.

846
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,920
Go ahead.

847
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,880
Which one lives?

848
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,560
Go ahead.

849
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:43,600
You're not here for this.
You want something.

850
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,560
-What is it?
-Radek.

851
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:51,440
-How can I do that? I can't.
-Then you die, the three of you.

852
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:54,000
I'll do anything to save my family.
Don't ask something I can't give!

853
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:58,000
The most powerful man on the earth.
Suddenly, there are things you can't do.

854
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:02,080
This is very curious.
Stop with your fucking lies!

855
01:25:12,360 --> 01:25:16,280
-Petrov will never give up Radek.
-Petrov is a dog.

856
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,040
He does what you tell him.

857
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,480
Tell him to do this.

858
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:29,520
Petrov used me.
I just wanted to stop the bloodshed.

859
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,640
He wanted a personal victory.
Petrov hates Radek.

860
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:36,400
Of course he hates Radek.
Radek is everything he is not.

861
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,880
A great man, a strong man.

862
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:41,600
Are you saying...

863
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,640
he would refuse you?

864
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:48,200
You'd be playing right into his hands.
Are you an idiot?

865
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:52,920
You'd make him into a hero.
The man who stopped the terrorists.

866
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:55,720
Or better yet,
the man who stopped me.

867
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:59,600
You talk as if you have nothing
to do with this.

868
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:05,200
This is all your doing.

869
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:08,000
This infection you call freedom.

870
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,320
Without meaning, without purpose.

871
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:13,320
You have given my country...

872
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:15,800
to gangsters and prostitutes.

873
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:20,800
You have taken everything from us.

874
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,440
There is nothing left.

875
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,640
Call him.

876
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:43,320
No!

877
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:46,400
No!

878
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:55,080
Sit!

879
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:57,280
-No.
-I have no choice.

880
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,120
-You have the choice.
-Leave her alone. It's between us.

881
01:27:02,200 --> 01:27:04,880
You lose a child,
it hollows you out.

882
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,840
We're soldiers.

883
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:10,160
You take my life.

884
01:27:11,200 --> 01:27:13,040
Have you no honor?

885
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:15,800
-I'll count to five.
-No!

886
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,960
-It's gonna be all right, honey.
-One.

887
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,240
-It's gonna be all right.
-Two.

888
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,880
I'll do it.

889
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,360
Yes.

890
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,320
I'll do it.

891
01:27:30,040 --> 01:27:32,480
You just leave my family alone.

892
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,480
Leave 'em alone.

893
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,360
Mr. President!

894
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,760
We just got an intercept.

895
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,200
The president called Petrov
and asked him to release Radek.

896
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:15,760
-He can't do that!
-He must have no choice.

897
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,000
We have a choice.

898
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:22,400
I have the signatures of the cabinet
attesting to the president's incapacity.

899
01:28:22,520 --> 01:28:25,760
-Sign it and you can overrule him.
-No. I won't do that.

900
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:29,320
The United States does not negotiate
with terrorists.

901
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:31,280
It's been our principle
for 25 years.

902
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,440
You can't give in to them now.

903
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:36,240
It'll be open season on
the United States. Many more will die.

904
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:43,120
Jim isn't making this decision as
president, but as a husband and father.

905
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,840
History will judge you
by what you do right now.

906
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,920
For God's sake, sign it.

907
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:32,560
<i>I can now confirm that General Radek
is in the process of being released.</i>

908
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:35,920
<i>I repeat. General Radek
is now being released.</i>

909
01:29:56,600 --> 01:30:00,520
Yes, yes.
General Radek has been released.

910
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,800
It is confirmed.

911
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,880
They are releasing the general.

912
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:14,160
Now what?

913
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:17,040
Now we return to our homeland...

914
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:19,920
where Radek will decide
how best to use you...

915
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,960
now that we know you are willing...

916
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,680
to negotiate.

917
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:27,320
Our nation needs so many things.

918
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:31,240
-You said you were gonna release us.
-Forgive me. I lied.

919
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:13,720
Listen.

920
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,560
-Sir, are you hit?
-Stay with the major, honey.

921
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:51,320
-Alice, get in the cockpit.
-Lie down.

922
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:23,560
-Let her go!
-Not until Radek is safely away.

923
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:27,360
Call it off.
Don't give up Radek.

924
01:33:27,480 --> 01:33:31,400
If anything happens to the general,
your wife will die!

925
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:47,840
You hear that?
It's almost over, Mr. President.

926
01:34:20,640 --> 01:34:22,000
Drop the gun!

927
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:38,120
You made one mistake when
you killed my pilot, Mr. President.

928
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:41,160
No one left to fly the plane.

929
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:46,840
And no parachute.

930
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:50,920
Whatever happens...

931
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:54,800
you lose and I win.

932
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,840
Get off my plane!

933
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,960
You all right?

934
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:13,800
Go.

935
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:16,400
Go! Call Petrov!

936
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:18,080
They killed him.

937
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:19,680
Mr. President.

938
01:37:27,720 --> 01:37:31,840
<i>He almost got away.
Did you hear me? Radek is dead.</i>

939
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:35,080
Yes! It's the president.
We have retaken the plane!

940
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:47,440
-How's he doing?
-Not good, sir.

941
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,960
-I don't suppose you know how to fly.
-No, sir.

942
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:53,480
-Come along. I'll need a copilot.
-Yes, sir.

943
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,240
How long since you've flown, sir?

944
01:37:57,320 --> 01:38:01,920
Twenty-five years.
Little planes. Never jets.

945
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,600
Nothing like this.

946
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:06,760
<i>-Anybody there?
-Yes, we're here, sir.</i>

947
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:08,840
You got somebody
that can help me fly this?

948
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:12,600
Sir, this is Colonel Jackson. We need
to get you out of hostile territory.

949
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:16,280
<i>-Good idea, Bob.
-Look above the central video screen.</i>

950
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:20,480
<i>There's a series of L.E.D. numbers.
One of them should read 1-1-0.</i>

951
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:22,880
<i>-Got it.
-That's your course heading.</i>

952
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:26,280
Just below, there's a knob
surrounded by hash marks.

953
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:29,840
<i>Turn that knob counterclockwise
to 290.</i>

954
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:33,160
<i>-We're turning, Bob.
-Good.</i>

955
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:38,960
<i>-This will take you out of Kazakhstan.
-We're gonna be okay.</i>

956
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:43,760
<i>Now, we can't land this plane on autopilot,
so we'll need to go over a few things.</i>

957
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,800
Where's the nearest safe landing site?

958
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,520
Incirlik, Turkey.

959
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:52,440
-General Northwood.
-Madam?

960
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:54,920
What's that?

961
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:58,160
Madam Vice President,
that red dot represents MiGs.

962
01:38:58,280 --> 01:38:59,880
On course to intercept "Air Force One".

963
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,240
Christ! They took off from Aktubinsk.

964
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:05,040
The base commander there
is loyal to Radek.

965
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:08,880
General, send our fighters
into Kazakhstan.

966
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:12,200
Order them to use any and all means
to protect the president.

967
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:15,400
When you're on final approach,
keep the throttles mid-range.

968
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:17,600
<i>-Mr. President, can you hear me?
-Yes, Kathryn.</i>

969
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:20,600
We're tracking six MiGs closing
on your position. I'm sending in...

970
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,520
<i>our F-15s to protect you.</i>

971
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,720
-Shit!
-Did she say MiGs?

972
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:27,200
Yes, she said MiGs.

973
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:30,120
Get in that seat and put a seat belt on.
We're having trouble.

974
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:36,360
These MiGs get closer,
I'm gonna have to maneuver this thing.

975
01:39:36,440 --> 01:39:38,320
How do I get it off autopilot?

976
01:39:38,440 --> 01:39:41,480
<i>Push the button on the yoke
by your left thumb.</i>

977
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:43,880
I'll try a little right turn.

978
01:39:43,960 --> 01:39:46,400
<i>Keep your moves smooth and steady.
It's all flying.</i>

979
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:49,600
Just step on the ball.

980
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:51,720
That's right.
Just like riding a bike.

981
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:55,880
Halo Flight, we are cleared to commit,
bearing 0-9-0.

982
01:39:55,960 --> 01:39:57,960
<i>Jettison tanks and push it up.</i>

983
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:05,440
These MiGs, how far away are they?

984
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:09,480
Never mind.

985
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:31,200
-One coming. Countermeasures activated.
-Left turn.

986
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:36,680
Jesus Christ!

987
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:39,720
-We need some help.
-U.S. fighters, this is "Air Force One."

988
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,480
<i>We are under attack.
Where are you?</i>

989
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:45,840
<i>This is Halo Flight closing
on your position. E. T.A. two minutes.</i>

990
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:47,520
We may not be here!

991
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:56,080
We're hit!

992
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:01,000
Christ. We're on fire.
We've got an engine on fire.

993
01:41:01,120 --> 01:41:04,040
<i>-Number four engine is on fire.
-Pull the fire handle overhead.</i>

994
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,000
I got it.

995
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:12,240
<i>-We're rolling right.
-Left rudder. You have to compensate.</i>

996
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:15,040
<i>-Do I pull back on number one engine?
-Negative. You'll slow down.</i>

997
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,160
-Trim it out.
-How do I do that?

998
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:20,240
<i>-Knob. Aft pedestal.
-Jesus Christ!</i>

999
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:24,560
We got a red light.
Looks like we're losing fuel.

1000
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:27,400
<i>Halo Flight.</i>

1001
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,600
Everybody lock a bandit.

1002
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:31,760
Stand by for max range.

1003
01:41:31,880 --> 01:41:33,800
And Fox Three!

1004
01:41:49,880 --> 01:41:51,680
<i>Kill one!</i>

1005
01:41:56,320 --> 01:42:00,560
<i>Kill two! Four more bandits
bearing 0-9-0. Halo Flight engage!</i>

1006
01:42:03,560 --> 01:42:05,640
Ha, ha! Good guys are here.

1007
01:42:08,320 --> 01:42:11,400
-Bug out west. We'll cover you.
-You got it.

1008
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:16,640
-Sir, pull up! You got one on your tail.
-Get him off my tail!

1009
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:19,760
Missile away.

1010
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:23,920
<i>-Break left and climb!
-Shit! Sir, we've lost countermeasures.</i>

1011
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:28,360
<i>This is "Halo 2." They've lost
countermeasures. I'm going in.</i>

1012
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:38,800
<i>Two's down! "Halo 2"is down!</i>

1013
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:41,000
<i>"Air Force One,"
are you still with us?</i>

1014
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:43,200
Yes! We're still here.

1015
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:51,040
Not so fast, you son of a bitch!

1016
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:01,080
The last three MiGs
are bugging out, sir.

1017
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:03,960
<i>-We're clear!
-Yes!</i>

1018
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,520
<i>-Bob, are you still there?
-Yes, sir.</i>

1019
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:11,080
Got a little problem here.
My rudder is sluggish.

1020
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,640
Let me look.

1021
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:18,320
Oh, man!

1022
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,520
<i>Sir, you're torn up pretty bad.</i>

1023
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:23,120
<i>Do you have any elevator control?</i>

1024
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:26,240
It's sluggish, too.
And we're still losing fuel.

1025
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:33,120
We got a problem up here.
Sirs, "Air Force One" is badly hit.

1026
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:37,920
<i>With the damage,
there's no way they can land.</i>

1027
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:42,600
I'm sorry, sir.

1028
01:43:44,600 --> 01:43:47,840
<i>-Thanks for your help.
-I'll stay on your wing, sir.</i>

1029
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:50,440
Take it straight and steady
until we figure out what to do.

1030
01:43:51,560 --> 01:43:52,720
Sir.

1031
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:57,200
You did great.

1032
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:19,440
They can't control the plane. Engines
are failing and they're losing fuel.

1033
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:21,560
There must be something
we can do to help them.

1034
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:25,880
-Is that our airstrip strike team?
-Yeah. Why?

1035
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,080
I just had a wild idea.

1036
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:30,920
<i>Time is critical.
Start turning north.</i>

1037
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,960
<i>-You'll get more details en route.
-Yes, sir.</i>

1038
01:44:34,080 --> 01:44:36,280
Change of orders acknowledged.

1039
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:46,600
<i>Try to hold your heading, sir.
They'll rejoin in about 25 minutes.</i>

1040
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:47,840
All right.

1041
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:49,880
<i>-We know it's risky.
-Understood.</i>

1042
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,360
<i>But we are all out of options.</i>

1043
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:56,120
Yeah, baby?

1044
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:59,400
It'll be okay.
Everything's gonna work.

1045
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:16,560
<i>Concerned Americans have gathered
at the White House...</i>

1046
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:18,960
to await word on the president
and his family.

1047
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:21,080
But CNN has learned
that "Air Force One"...

1048
01:45:21,160 --> 01:45:24,400
is severely crippled
and virtually unlandable.

1049
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:27,600
Sources report that the first family
is still trapped on board.

1050
01:45:27,720 --> 01:45:31,560
And a daring midair rescue operation
is said to be underway.

1051
01:45:34,200 --> 01:45:36,560
<i>"Air Force One," this is "Liberty 2-4"
approaching on your left side.</i>

1052
01:45:36,640 --> 01:45:39,040
<i>-Do you read?
-"Air Force One." Loud and clear.</i>

1053
01:45:39,120 --> 01:45:42,680
Gibbs, they're here.
Get the door.

1054
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:46,320
<i>-We'll need 10,000 feet and 200 knots.
-We've got to get her slowed down.</i>

1055
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:51,760
<i>"Air Force One" and "Liberty 2-4,"
this is "AWACS Blue Star."</i>

1056
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,280
<i>We have you in radar contact.</i>

1057
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,680
<i>"Liberty 2-4,"
they're almost out of fuel.</i>

1058
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,160
<i>Roger.</i>

1059
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:12,320
<i>"Air Force One," keep the wings level.</i>

1060
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:16,080
<i>If the engines fail, sacrifice altitude
to maintain airspeed.</i>

1061
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:23,120
Ready!

1062
01:46:23,120 --> 01:46:26,160
"Liberty 2-4," ramp leader.
First man is on his way.

1063
01:46:26,200 --> 01:46:28,680
Back up. Easy.

1064
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:31,920
<i>"Air Force One," come left, six.</i>

1065
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:39,160
-How's my speed?
-It's good. See if you can hold it.

1066
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:42,760
<i>A little more left, sir.
Three, two, stop.</i>

1067
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:54,600
Take my arm! Pull me in!

1068
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:58,760
Come on! Come on!

1069
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:05,000
-Unhook me.
-I got it.

1070
01:47:04,960 --> 01:47:06,520
Good.

1071
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:11,840
"Liberty," locked in.
Where's the president?

1072
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:14,040
Up in the cockpit.

1073
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:28,360
-We lost another engine.
-"Liberty," we lost another engine.

1074
01:47:28,480 --> 01:47:29,840
"Liberty 2-4." Acknowledged.

1075
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:32,840
Sir, time to go.

1076
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:37,400
-Who's gonna fly the plane?
-I'll take care of that, sir. Got it.

1077
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,000
Go!

1078
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:41,640
Ramp to pilot.
Second P.J.'s on the way.

1079
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:54,520
-Mr. President, this way!
-My family first.

1080
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:57,960
-Sir, I have orders to take you off.
-Them first.

1081
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:03,600
<i>"Blue Star," the third parajumper
is boarding "Air Force One."</i>

1082
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:07,000
<i>-Standing by for recovery.
-Roger. Moving into receiver position.</i>

1083
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:13,880
-Dad?
-You'll be all right, honey.

1084
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,240
-Promise?
-Promise.

1085
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,080
Close your eyes.

1086
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:20,560
You can do it.
Just hold on tight.

1087
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:24,280
It's okay. Don't worry.

1088
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:29,480
She's okay.

1089
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:37,880
-Hang on!
-Ramp to pilot. We got her!

1090
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,720
I'm right behind you.

1091
01:48:57,240 --> 01:48:58,680
Come on there!

1092
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:00,880
Hang on. Good.

1093
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:04,480
-You're next, sir.
-Him next. He's wounded.

1094
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:07,600
-You go.
-Come on, Shep. Come on, pal.

1095
01:49:13,400 --> 01:49:15,040
We've lost another engine.

1096
01:49:20,440 --> 01:49:24,720
<i>You're sinking too fast. We only
have time for one more retrieval.</i>

1097
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:29,800
<i>We're passing 3,000 feet.
Impact in less than two minutes.</i>

1098
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:32,680
<i>Get the president out of there!</i>

1099
01:49:32,760 --> 01:49:34,480
Right here.

1100
01:49:34,600 --> 01:49:37,000
Easy there.

1101
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:38,880
He's on.

1102
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,760
-Get your arms ready. It's time to go.
-What about the other team?

1103
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:46,400
There's no time.
I can only take one more.

1104
01:49:46,480 --> 01:49:48,320
No! We're all going!

1105
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:52,120
That's impossible, sir.
I have to take you.

1106
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:55,560
It's time to get you off this plane.
Go, sir.

1107
01:49:55,640 --> 01:49:57,160
Go!

1108
01:49:58,680 --> 01:50:00,440
Please go!

1109
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,920
It was you?

1110
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:27,720
-Give me the strap!
-I trusted you with my life.

1111
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:30,760
So will the next president.
Now, give it to me.

1112
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:37,320
<i>We have to release the cable.
We're descending from 1200 feet.</i>

1113
01:50:39,200 --> 01:50:41,840
I'm getting off this plane!

1114
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:56,800
<i>Seven hundred!</i>

1115
01:50:59,680 --> 01:51:00,920
<i>Five hundred!</i>

1116
01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:02,920
We have to pull up!

1117
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:33,160
<i>"Blue Star."
"Air Force One" is down.</i>

1118
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:35,720
<i>I repeat.
"Air Force One" is down.</i>

1119
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:38,360
<i>"Liberty 2-4,"
do you have the president?</i>

1120
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:43,880
Right. You can do it.

1121
01:51:47,320 --> 01:51:50,760
<i>-"Liberty," do you have the president?
-Stand by.</i>

1122
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:08,320
Hang on!

1123
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,000
We got him!

1124
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:17,040
<i>"Liberty 2-4"is changing call signs.
"Liberty 2-4"is now...</i>

1125
01:52:17,120 --> 01:52:18,800
<i>"Air Force One"!</i>

1126
01:52:27,640 --> 01:52:31,240
Mr. President, welcome aboard, sir.
