1
00:00:29,074 --> 00:00:33,374
They say the great thing aboutbeing a kidis,
it's so easy to pretend.

2
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:38,883
You can have a conversation
with your dog, ora baseball, ora banana.

3
00:00:39,017 --> 00:00:43,078
Well, whatifit wasn'tpretend?
What ifyou couldhave a conversation?

4
00:00:43,188 --> 00:00:47,420
l mean, not with a baseball ora banana -
that's ridiculous. But with your dog...

5
00:00:47,492 --> 00:00:52,395
l mean, we don't have the same concept
of time that, for instance, people do.

6
00:00:52,464 --> 00:00:56,059
Because you have watches and clocks.

7
00:00:56,168 --> 00:01:01,265
But we do know that you go away. And it's
not like we don't know that you're gone.

8
00:01:01,373 --> 00:01:04,171
So, we don't know exactly how long, no.

9
00:01:04,242 --> 00:01:07,871
Why do dogs sniff each other's butts?

10
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:11,677
Well, that's just kinda
our way of shaking hands.

11
00:01:11,783 --> 00:01:15,844
lf you really wanna get a sense of
who somebody is, you gotta snifftheir butt.

12
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:19,254
Son. Stop talkin' to the dog.

13
00:01:19,324 --> 00:01:21,588
She doesn't understand a word.

14
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,288
At firsthis dad thought ''Hey, it's harmless.''

15
00:01:24,396 --> 00:01:29,527
But as time went on, John crossed that
fine line between harmless andjust weird.

16
00:01:29,635 --> 00:01:30,659
Mr Galvin.

17
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:32,897
- Mr Dolittle.
- This is my son John.

18
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:37,442
- John, this is your new principal, Mr Galvin.
- Nice to meet you, John.

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,877
That's not good.

20
00:01:43,949 --> 00:01:46,247
- Nice to meet you.
- John...!

21
00:01:48,654 --> 00:01:51,145
lt was time to putan end to it.

22
00:01:52,557 --> 00:01:55,355
Thank you for coming, Reverend.

23
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:08,331
Leave this boy, devil man. Go now, Satan.
Take the serpent's voices with you.

24
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:13,434
l command you to come outta this boy.
Come on outta this boy.

25
00:02:13,512 --> 00:02:15,571
God said it. Come on!

26
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:17,842
l'm gonna bite ya.

27
00:02:18,583 --> 00:02:20,141
Get off.

28
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:23,449
Get this dog... get this dog off of me.

29
00:02:29,194 --> 00:02:31,685
She was my best friend.

30
00:02:31,763 --> 00:02:35,199
You'll make some real friends now.

31
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:38,964
From that day on, John Dolittle
never spoke to animals again.

32
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:42,336
Someday, you're gonna thank me for this.

33
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:44,671
And aftera while allhe couldremember

34
00:02:44,743 --> 00:02:47,371
was that deep down
there was something missing.

35
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,317
And, justlike his dad wanted, he grew up
to be a regularguy. You know, miserable.

36
00:02:53,385 --> 00:02:55,615
Hey! Hey, get outta here.

37
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:09,363
Stupid mutt.
A vicious animal's in the hallway.

38
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:17,105
Did lmention he was a father? A lotlike his
own father, who was a father to him before

39
00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:18,904
he himselfbecame...

40
00:03:19,711 --> 00:03:21,542
She's gota giant egg.

41
00:03:25,617 --> 00:03:30,350
- Good morning, Charisse.
- l have changed my name to Paprika.

42
00:03:30,422 --> 00:03:33,516
Paprika? Paprika Dolittle.
That has a nice ring to it.

43
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:36,959
Not Dolittle. Just Paprika.

44
00:03:37,028 --> 00:03:39,963
Well, l don't understand it.
What is that about?

45
00:03:40,031 --> 00:03:42,829
You know, Salt-n-Pepa? Paprika?

46
00:03:42,934 --> 00:03:47,200
- OK. Paprika. l get it.
- l think Paprika is a beautiful name.

47
00:03:47,272 --> 00:03:49,934
Really? l think Paprika
sounds like a seasoning.

48
00:03:51,777 --> 00:03:54,803
- Dolittle.
- He doesn't take anything we want seriously.

49
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,745
Tell me about it.

50
00:03:56,815 --> 00:03:59,249
l did go over the proposal. lt's unbelievable.

51
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:03,287
- OK, l'm on my way in now.
- Maya, where are you goin' with that?

52
00:04:03,388 --> 00:04:07,154
- lt's for my swan egg l found.
- Looks like it'd be a good omelette.

53
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:11,361
- lt's gonna hatch any day now.
- You'll miss that cos you'll be at camp.

54
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:17,231
l can't go. When a bird hatches, the first thing
it sees, it bonds with it. l want it to be me.

55
00:04:17,302 --> 00:04:21,500
You know, it is not healthy for you
to spend all your time with your experiments.

56
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:25,702
An experiment for you would be to spend
time with kids your own age at camp,

57
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:29,076
which is exactly where you're goin'
this Sunday - camp.

58
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:31,843
And what about my pet egg?

59
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:35,444
Here. Here's half a dozen pet eggs
to take with you to camp.

60
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,250
- Stop it.
- l don't know what all the fuss is about.

61
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:42,384
We went and bought you that thing -
what was that pet rat thing that we bought?

62
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,829
- A guinea pig.
- The thing died. And it's not our fault.

63
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:49,867
lt didn't die.
His name is Rodney and he's in my room.

64
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:52,426
So why are you bothering me
about the swan...?

65
00:04:52,504 --> 00:04:55,064
- l'm goin' to work. Goodbye.
- Bye.

66
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,405
Have a nice day, everybody. Nice day.

67
00:05:03,882 --> 00:05:07,750
Johnny. Gene has got some qualms
about the new proposal. Talk to him.

68
00:05:07,853 --> 00:05:11,687
- No room for qualms, Gene.
- No room for qualms.

69
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:15,522
- Qualms are bad.
- Qualms are bad. Listen to Johnny.

70
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:17,959
l have qualms l'd like to discuss.

71
00:05:18,063 --> 00:05:22,762
l'm just afraid that ifwe let a big company
like Calnet take us over,

72
00:05:22,868 --> 00:05:25,701
you know, we're not gonna be us any more.

73
00:05:25,937 --> 00:05:29,873
- You know? We'd be them.
- Let me explain.

74
00:05:30,442 --> 00:05:33,275
''Them'' has the best hospitals,
the best labs,

75
00:05:33,345 --> 00:05:37,509
and ''them'' is gonna pay us
a very big, giant amount of money.

76
00:05:37,582 --> 00:05:41,313
l swear to God that
when l think about the money, l get teary.

77
00:05:41,386 --> 00:05:45,288
- Look at me.
- Those are real tears in his eyes.

78
00:05:45,357 --> 00:05:49,691
So Saturday we're sitting down with the
Calnet people. l'm very excited about it.

79
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:54,061
Hey, wait. Whoa. Saturday morning? l'm
supposed to take my family to the country.

80
00:05:54,132 --> 00:05:56,191
Well, don't.

81
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:59,065
You see? lt's happening already.

82
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:03,130
- What?
- You're being forced to neglect your family.

83
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:05,608
Gene, relax. No such thing.

84
00:06:06,711 --> 00:06:09,578
- Mrs O'Brien?
- Yes.

85
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:12,946
How are you? ls your tummy still...?

86
00:06:13,018 --> 00:06:17,079
Saturday morning, guys.
Gene, no tank tops, please.

87
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:20,022
- Mrs Parkus.
- Yes, Doctor?

88
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:23,993
- Mrs Parkus. Have you eaten shellfish again?
- Just soft-shell crab.

89
00:06:24,095 --> 00:06:26,427
- And what's the middle word?
- Shell.

90
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:30,033
Rodney's lost. He's not in his cage.

91
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:32,399
Y'all get goin'. l'll find your hamster.

92
00:06:32,504 --> 00:06:36,235
- He's a guinea pig.
- Whatever. lt's a rodent. l'll find the rodent.

93
00:06:36,374 --> 00:06:38,433
Hey, Nutmeg, let's go.

94
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:43,572
You better wipe that look offyour face.

95
00:06:43,648 --> 00:06:45,639
That's better.

96
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,810
- She's turnin' into a wiseass.
- She's turning into you.

97
00:06:49,254 --> 00:06:54,590
You know, there's more to this HMO deal
than money. You sell, they own you.

98
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:56,752
This will be good for us.

99
00:06:56,828 --> 00:07:02,198
l am so tired ofthat rap. lt's always for us.
But sometimes l don't know who ''us'' is.

100
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:06,203
What do you mean? Us is us.
Me and you and Maya and Charisse.

101
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:11,834
Lisa, the more money you have, the more
time you can spend with your family.

102
00:07:11,943 --> 00:07:16,573
Meanwhile you'll just have to make do with
this fancy sports car you always wanted.

103
00:07:16,648 --> 00:07:20,140
- Right here. Beautiful.
- Oh, my God, John. You didn't!

104
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:25,053
No, l didn't. But l saw how fluttery you got,
so don't tell me you don't care about money.

105
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:29,456
- ''John, you didn't!''
- That's not funny.

106
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:32,621
So, Daddy, you have to find Rodney.

107
00:07:32,697 --> 00:07:36,098
- l'll put down some ofthat sticky paper.
- No, don't.

108
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:39,864
Don't worry. You peel him
right off it and he'll live.

109
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:45,671
Tell you what. l will turn the house upside
down and l will find Rodney for you. Yes?

110
00:07:45,777 --> 00:07:50,407
- And call me if my egg starts to hatch.
- l will call you ifyour egg starts to hatch.

111
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:33,347
Ma!

112
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:40,323
Let's go. Let's go.

113
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:43,457
Get in there. And you stay in there.

114
00:08:57,849 --> 00:08:58,873
Dolittle.

115
00:09:02,487 --> 00:09:05,047
Mrs Parkus, do you have a death wish?

116
00:09:05,123 --> 00:09:07,353
But l took it out ofthe shell.

117
00:09:08,793 --> 00:09:11,887
- Can l talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

118
00:09:12,864 --> 00:09:16,061
- You couldn't tell what it was without me?
- l knew what it was.

119
00:09:16,134 --> 00:09:18,329
She was frightened. She wanted her doctor.

120
00:09:18,403 --> 00:09:22,169
- lt's a beautiful thing.
- That's a beautiful thing?

121
00:09:22,273 --> 00:09:24,298
- How old are you?
- 26.

122
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:29,711
You spend all your time here, right? Probably
grab your naps curled up in the break room.

123
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:32,944
Occasional nooky with
one ofthe interns in the closet.

124
00:09:33,017 --> 00:09:37,920
l have a real life. And l'd appreciate it ifyou
only called me when it was a real emergency.

125
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:40,890
lf a patient comes in
carrying his own head, call me.

126
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,985
Somebody has a bicycle up their ass,
call me. Understand?

127
00:09:44,095 --> 00:09:47,758
Yeah, l understand.
So, you want me to give her the injection?

128
00:09:47,832 --> 00:09:51,393
l would not be a smartass right now
if l was you.

129
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:56,906
Making little smart statements to me
at two o'clock in the morning after l came...

130
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,184
ls there something wrong, Doctor?

131
00:10:11,923 --> 00:10:13,982
No, Mrs Parkus.

132
00:10:16,361 --> 00:10:18,056
There we go.

133
00:10:18,163 --> 00:10:19,858
- OK.
- Thank you.

134
00:10:19,964 --> 00:10:21,556
You're welcome.

135
00:11:07,712 --> 00:11:10,442
Watch where you're goin'
next time, bonehead.

136
00:11:34,005 --> 00:11:38,237
Let me start by saying thank you very much
for giving up part ofyour weekend.

137
00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:42,268
We just want to make sure
we can answer any and all ofyour questions.

138
00:11:42,347 --> 00:11:45,407
We want you to be comfortable
with what we're proposing.

139
00:11:45,483 --> 00:11:49,749
And, speaking ofwhich,
that explains the details ofthe buyout.

140
00:11:49,854 --> 00:11:54,291
The information you're probably
most interested in is on page four.

141
00:11:54,359 --> 00:11:57,692
Wow, four million dollars.
That's pretty comfortable.

142
00:11:57,762 --> 00:12:01,960
- l'm comfortable. You comfortable, Geno?
- l have some questions.

143
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:04,330
- No, you don't.
- Yes, l do.

144
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:07,670
Are we gonna have to cut back on our staff?

145
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:10,503
Yes. Unfortunately,
we'll have to make some cuts.

146
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:12,667
Bread?

147
00:12:12,744 --> 00:12:14,837
No, thank you.

148
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,843
- ''No, thank you''?
- Yeah. You offered me some bread.

149
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:23,114
- l don't want any, thanks.
- So you have no problem with staff cuts?

150
00:12:23,187 --> 00:12:26,748
- You gonna share that bread?
- You just said you didn't want any.

151
00:12:26,858 --> 00:12:30,089
- What is it, some kind ofjoke?
- Absolutely not.

152
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:32,994
- Bagel chips!
- Back off or you'll find your nuts in a tree.

153
00:12:33,097 --> 00:12:34,689
Where's the love?

154
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:38,930
So, John, do you have a problem
with that or not? John?

155
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:42,769
- Watch your head.
- That's enough meeting for me. l gotta go.

156
00:12:42,874 --> 00:12:45,399
This was a great meeting. Very productive.

157
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:47,978
Wonderful meeting.
See you guys on Monday.

158
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,980
l'll talk to you later. 'Scuse me.

159
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:56,314
Johnny's been on call all night,
Mr Calloway. He's very excited.

160
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,789
You gotta move it.

161
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,966

162
00:13:12,036 --> 00:13:16,302
Oh, jeez. Thanks, man.

163
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,788
This is ridiculous.

00:13:47,138 --> 00:13:49,868
Boy, we gotsome fresh airhere.

165
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:53,842
That's the thing about the city.
You don't realise it...

166
00:13:53,945 --> 00:13:56,004
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

167
00:13:56,748 --> 00:13:59,182
l should've put on my seat belt.

168
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:04,483
Easy now. Easy now.
Slow your butt down! Whoa.

169
00:14:07,158 --> 00:14:09,353
Jeez, Louise! That didn't seem too safe.

170
00:14:10,194 --> 00:14:12,185
My back hurt.

171
00:14:12,263 --> 00:14:16,495
This is a dream. l'm dreaming right now.

172
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:20,059
Hold it. Stop.
You're talkin' and l understand you.

173
00:14:21,072 --> 00:14:26,908
Those guys in my dorm told me that stuff
was safe. 15 years later, this starts happenin'.

174
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:29,502
Let's chill. Let's just chill.

175
00:14:30,848 --> 00:14:33,817
l'm not gonna chill. You gonna chill.

176
00:14:33,885 --> 00:14:36,649
- Are you switchin' sides?
- All right, you. Come on.

177
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:40,781

178
00:14:41,826 --> 00:14:44,090

- No. We're fine.

179
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:47,824
- l'm just stretchin' my legs.
- Ask her if she's got any lettuce.

180
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:52,666
- Shut your little furry mouth right now.
- Are you sure you're OK?

181
00:14:54,472 --> 00:14:56,997
Yeah. l'm fine.

182
00:14:57,074 --> 00:15:00,202
- That's good.
- Thank you. Thank you so much.

183
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:02,337
- Goodbye.

184
00:15:05,149 --> 00:15:06,013
Monster!

185
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,483
- Hey, what are you doin'?
- Leave me alone.

186
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:11,954
- What are you, nuts? l'll roast.
- Stay away or l'll kill you.

187
00:15:12,056 --> 00:15:16,516
Don't leave me out here. lt's hot.
Hey, what kind of doc are you?

188
00:15:16,627 --> 00:15:19,425
Hey, doc. This is cruel to animals.

189
00:15:22,099 --> 00:15:24,226
Come on. l'm your friend.

190
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:26,361
l'm your buddy.

191
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:29,064
Reverse.

192
00:15:30,174 --> 00:15:35,908
That's it. Back up. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Don't run over the cage now.

193
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:42,147
Man, you scared the crap outta me.
See? There it is.

194
00:15:42,253 --> 00:15:44,517
Shut up. Shut up right now.

195
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:48,919
Say one more word and l'll leave you
here in the road. Understand?

196
00:15:48,993 --> 00:15:50,654
OK, OK, OK.

197
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:55,928
Stop. Slow down.

198
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,298
Shut up. l can hear you up there. Shut up.

199
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:00,860
l'm gettin' whisker-whipped up here.

200
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:06,774
One more word and l'm gonna pull over, let
you out your cage and leave you in the wild.

201
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,312
See how much you talk
with real squirrels kickin' in your ass.

202
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:12,281
Fine, then l'll sing.

203
00:16:16,087 --> 00:16:18,578
- You know it is.
- Turnin' up the radio.

204
00:16:20,091 --> 00:16:22,992
- l can't hear you. l'm groovin'.
- Come on. Let me in.

205
00:16:23,094 --> 00:16:28,157
Hey, why they call me guinea pig anyway?
l'm not ltalian and l'm not pork.

206
00:16:32,603 --> 00:16:35,902
Grandpa, did Daddy learn
how to be bossy from you?

207
00:16:35,973 --> 00:16:38,771
Maya, don't talk to your grandfather that way.

208
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,937
He certainly didn't learn it from his mother,
God rest her soul.

209
00:16:43,014 --> 00:16:49,146
One day you'll understand that sometimes
your parents do know what they're doing.

210
00:16:53,991 --> 00:16:57,552
- l made it.
- Daddy, what's Rodney doing on the roof?

211
00:16:57,628 --> 00:17:01,120
l thought the fresh air
would do him some good, honey.

212
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:02,927
- Hey.
- Are you OK?

213
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,126
l'm fine.

214
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:05,930
- Hey.
- Lunatic.

215
00:17:06,003 --> 00:17:08,733
Daddy, we still got those BB guns
l used to play with?

216
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:11,274
- Crazy man.
- BB gun?

217
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:12,774
Psycho.

218
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:16,938
- Son, l think you need a vacation.
- And l'm gonna have one too.

219
00:17:17,014 --> 00:17:22,816
This is beautiful. 'Scuse me, honey.
Hey, what's that step called?

220
00:17:25,022 --> 00:17:27,217
Let's get rid of Maya's little rat thing.

221
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:32,422
He's a guinea pig.
l don't know why you let him get to you.

222
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:36,557
l goan get gim. l guss... Gugga geggond.

223
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,103
l'm not lettin' him get to me. Not the least bit.

224
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,269
Good.

225
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,780
- l'll be right back.
- ls it all right if l wait in the bed naked?

226
00:17:56,854 --> 00:17:58,583
Yes.

227
00:17:58,656 --> 00:18:01,386
Time to come out ofthese drawers, then.

228
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:03,518
Hello!

229
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:06,520

Hello.

That's right. You're the one

234
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,478
No, l'm not hearing anything.
l can't hear you.

235
00:18:21,545 --> 00:18:25,447
The whole woods are talking about you,
you know.

236
00:18:25,516 --> 00:18:27,677
Listen, can you do me a favour?

237
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:32,246
Can you just take this stick out of my wing?
lt's killin' me. Can ya, huh?

238
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:37,317
Don't worry. l won't hurt you.

239
00:18:44,101 --> 00:18:47,036
Much better. Good job. Thank you.

240
00:18:51,308 --> 00:18:53,435
What's happenin' to me?

241
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:57,504
You're gonna be
pleasantly surprised, that's what.

242
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:03,748
- Oh, my goodness. lt's an owl.
- Yeah, a big, nasty owl. Let's go in.

243
00:19:03,854 --> 00:19:06,288

- They're very dangerous.

244
00:19:06,357 --> 00:19:09,292
- No, they're not.
- They are. They can poke your eye out.

245
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,852
- Come on!
- Yes, they can. Very easily.

246
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,865
- Take a finger off.
- What you doin' with that owl?

247
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:19,596
Go get into bed.
l'm gonna go check on Charisse and Maya.

248
00:19:19,704 --> 00:19:21,365
- Are you OK?
- l'm fine.

249
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:24,305

Crazy man! You havin' fun in there.

Can l make a request?
Can l get tuna in oil instead ofwater?

253
00:19:44,495 --> 00:19:46,554
Who put in that bug-zapper?

254
00:19:50,534 --> 00:19:52,695

00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:59,175
Yo, looky here. Hey, buddy, my old lady

Got to lose that bug light.
l know you can hear me.

258
00:20:04,315 --> 00:20:07,580
Hey, doc, while you're out, get some salmon.

259
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:10,711

261
00:20:13,424 --> 00:20:16,621

- Wait! John, why?

262
00:20:16,727 --> 00:20:18,957
- John, you just got here.

(coughs)

267
00:20:34,745 --> 00:20:36,804
(squawks)

268
00:20:40,251 --> 00:20:43,379

- Come on. Pick up the phone. Pick it up!

269
00:20:43,454 --> 00:20:47,857

l wondered ifyou wanted to get together
for a drink or a CAT scan or somethin'.

274
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,408
A CATscan?

275
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,572
Can it wait tillmorning?

00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,828

Come on. Bring it on. l'll tear you to pieces.

281
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:40,038
- You are tempting fate now, buddy.
- Right here, fat boy.

00:21:40,144 --> 00:21:42,237
Put it right here. l'll murderise you.

283
00:21:42,313 --> 00:21:46,272
- Stick 'em up, you little rat.
- Hey, come here, you gerbil.

- Hey, what are you looking at?
- Me?

285
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:51,520
Yeah, you. Who else, buddy?

286
00:21:51,622 --> 00:21:54,921
l'm lookin' at a couple of greasy rats
fightin' over garbage.

287
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:58,119
Come here and say that,
you four-eyed dufus biped!

288
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:00,891
l'll get bubonic on your ass. Come here.

289
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:04,861
What if l take that light bulb,
put it between your butt cheeks

290
00:22:04,935 --> 00:22:07,165
and make a rodent lamp out ofyou?

291
00:22:07,271 --> 00:22:10,468
Let me tell you somethin'.
l'm a human. l'm a human.

292
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:14,944
Hey. Sam, how are you? How are you?
Thanks for comin' down, Sam. Thanks.

293
00:22:16,347 --> 00:22:21,080
- There's no abnormalities of any kind.
- All right, then.

294
00:22:21,185 --> 00:22:23,915
- Why are you hearing animal voices?
- Exactly.

295
00:22:23,988 --> 00:22:27,287
Why do l think l am if everything is fine?
l tell ya, Sam,

296
00:22:28,525 --> 00:22:32,791
l don't wanna wind up like one ofthese guys
on the street, talking to myself

297
00:22:32,897 --> 00:22:36,355
and stinking, with my hair all matted.
lt's not a cool look.

298
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:40,494
Have you been under
any unusual stress lately?

299
00:22:41,071 --> 00:22:46,304
Not really. My wife's been givin' me
a hard time about Calnet, but that can't be it.

300
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:49,408
- Small potatoes.
- l did hit a dog the other day.

301
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,378
Oh, my God! A dog?

302
00:22:52,483 --> 00:22:56,214
- Hey, make me feel worse, huh?
- Well, l'm sorry, but a little doggie?

303
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,312
- The dog was fine. lt got up and ran off.
- He was injured?

304
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:02,723
He felt well enough to scream out
''bonehead'' before he left.

305
00:23:04,094 --> 00:23:08,428
- John, the dog couldn't have spoken to you.
- Well, Sam, with all due respect...

306
00:23:08,532 --> 00:23:13,231
No, John. The dog did not speak to you.

307
00:23:14,571 --> 00:23:18,507
Maybe you're right.
l'm sorry l woke you up for this.

308
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:21,034
Thanks.

309
00:23:21,145 --> 00:23:22,908

00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,574
- l'm OK.
- Are you sure?

311
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:27,981
Really. l just freaked out a little bit.

312
00:23:28,052 --> 00:23:30,520
- What's wrong?
- l got stress l been under.

313
00:23:30,587 --> 00:23:33,147
- From what?
- The merger and the practice.

314
00:23:33,257 --> 00:23:35,521
lt's all come to a head, and l'm sorry.

315
00:23:35,592 --> 00:23:38,459
OK, John, just come back out here, OK?

316
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:41,531
Yeah, l'm on my w...
Yeah, l'm on my way out now.

317
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:45,732
Bonehead!

318
00:23:45,803 --> 00:23:47,930
- l'll see you in a few.
- John?

319
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:49,969
John?

320
00:23:57,948 --> 00:24:02,681
- 'Scuse me. Where's the stray dogs?
- Right this way.

321
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:07,616
- Yo!
- What's up?

322
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,753
Hey, buddy.

323
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:13,421
Over here.

324
00:24:13,497 --> 00:24:17,558
Hey, mister.
Bet you l won't bite nobody again.

325
00:24:18,969 --> 00:24:21,028
l am Keyser Soze.

326
00:24:21,105 --> 00:24:24,097
l have owners.
They've just been out oftown for a few...

327
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:26,301
..a few years.

328
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:30,908
- Dead dog walkin'.
- That does not sound good.

329
00:24:31,015 --> 00:24:35,213
When are we gonna get
some decent chow in here?

330
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,446
Hey, thanks a lot. Whoa, that was close, huh?

331
00:24:39,523 --> 00:24:42,390
Hey, hey, you got kids?
Kids, they're the greatest.

332
00:24:42,459 --> 00:24:45,986
- Kids are great(!) What the hell is goin' on?
- Hey, you understood me.

333
00:24:46,063 --> 00:24:49,294
You don't say.
How come l can understand you talkin'?

334
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,664
l don't know. Maybe you're just weird.

335
00:24:51,735 --> 00:24:54,295
Hey, shut up. You're a dog. Dogs can't talk.

336
00:24:54,405 --> 00:24:57,067
What do you think barking is?
An involuntary spasm(?)

337
00:24:57,141 --> 00:25:00,008
l don't know what it is.
l know you're not barking.

338
00:25:00,077 --> 00:25:02,875
And l'm going to be with my family.
Good luck to you.

339
00:25:02,946 --> 00:25:05,141
That's it?

340
00:25:07,718 --> 00:25:12,849
lt must be that truck exhaust or something.
Oh, no! Everything's going black.

341
00:25:14,625 --> 00:25:17,150
lt's not good.

342
00:25:26,737 --> 00:25:28,898
Thank you. Oops.

343
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:33,701
ls that the biggest ass you've ever seen?

344
00:25:33,777 --> 00:25:35,836
Lie down.

345
00:25:35,913 --> 00:25:40,782
Lie down. Lie down, Chauncy.

346
00:25:42,352 --> 00:25:46,755
- He's deaf.
- l'm not. l just can't stand listening to her.

347
00:25:46,857 --> 00:25:51,191
Just don't fix me, OK? Please. Don't fix me.

348
00:25:51,995 --> 00:25:54,657
l won't look at another female ever, l swear.

349
00:25:54,731 --> 00:25:59,998
Anything but my manhood, man.
Not my manhood, please! l'm...

350
00:26:00,604 --> 00:26:04,404
Yo, baby, what's up?
You lookin' sweet there, sugar. ls it the...

351
00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:08,274
No. Don't, please.
Please, ju... No, no, no, don't.

352
00:26:08,378 --> 00:26:10,539
Please, l'm begging you.

353
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:14,175
Dolittle.

354
00:26:14,284 --> 00:26:16,309
Come on.

355
00:26:24,828 --> 00:26:27,797
So, what seems to be the problem?

356
00:26:27,898 --> 00:26:32,335
Well, l really think it's pulmonary distress.
And he might have fluid on his lungs.

357
00:26:32,903 --> 00:26:36,202
- Let me guess. You're an MD.
- Yes, l am.

358
00:26:36,306 --> 00:26:41,209
l can always tell when a real doctor comes in.
They always do a little amateur diagnosis.

359
00:26:41,311 --> 00:26:46,510
- Tell him to get away from my butt.
- l did go to veterinary school for five years.

360
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:49,916
ls itjust me,
or is he hovering around my butt a lot?

361
00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:53,946
And unlike an MD,
my patient cannot tell me where it hurts.

362
00:26:54,024 --> 00:26:56,652
Seriously,
could you tell him my butt is great?

363
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,321
So, Doctor, ifyou don't mind...

364
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:02,591
Hey, where's he's gonna put that?

365
00:27:02,666 --> 00:27:06,796
Look, look, l was faking it, OK? l feel fine.
Just don't let him stick that...

366
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,599
Hello!

367
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,970
Let's just have a listen to those lungs.

368
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,942
l'm gonna swallow it.
And l don't mean in my mouth.

369
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:16,639
Dr Fish, l should pull that out a little bit.

370
00:27:16,747 --> 00:27:20,615
- Don't you touch that.
- lt's headin' in. lt's goin' south for the winter.

371
00:27:22,352 --> 00:27:26,652
Now, you see? l have to interpret
what the dog is moaning about.

372
00:27:26,757 --> 00:27:30,488
What's to interpret?
There's a thermometer. lt's in my butt.

373
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:34,294
- Take it easy. lt'll be over in a minute.
- What?

374
00:27:34,431 --> 00:27:38,367
- Yes.
- Well, there it goes. Buttjust swallowed it.

375
00:27:39,102 --> 00:27:44,301
Doctor? l'm just guessing, but l think
you might have just lost your thermometer.

376
00:27:52,783 --> 00:27:54,512
lt's gone.

377
00:27:55,986 --> 00:27:58,318
All right, l have... l have three options.

378
00:27:58,655 --> 00:28:01,783
- One: l can manually retrieve it.
- What's he sayin'?

379
00:28:01,858 --> 00:28:03,917
Options. Retrieve it manually.

380
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:08,987
- Pass.
- Two: give the dog a laxative and wait it out.

381
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:11,830
And three: surgically remove it.

382
00:28:11,902 --> 00:28:14,063
- A laxative or surgery.
- Laxative!

383
00:28:14,638 --> 00:28:18,506
Why don't you just give him a laxative?
lt'd probably come out later on.

384
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:21,510
- Never works.
- So what would you suggest?

385
00:28:24,314 --> 00:28:27,010
l'd like to go in manually.

386
00:28:31,822 --> 00:28:34,518
- Here we go.
- Oh, my Lord!

387
00:28:34,658 --> 00:28:38,059
This is not good. Lassie go home!

388
00:28:45,902 --> 00:28:50,168
Why on earth would a guy
go into a line ofwork like that?

389
00:28:50,274 --> 00:28:54,904
- All right. That's it for you. Hit the road.
- What? But l'm your pet.

390
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:59,915
You are not my pet. lf l were gonna get a pet,
l wouldn't get one as annoying as you. Go.

391
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:04,343
Hey, don't worry about it.
You sprung me from the joint. l'm thankful.

392
00:29:04,454 --> 00:29:06,945
- Yeah. Just go.
- Don't worry about me.

393
00:29:07,057 --> 00:29:10,549
l'll just be goin' down the road,
disappearing without a trace.

394
00:29:11,728 --> 00:29:14,196
l hope a car doesn't hit me.
Oh, well, one less dog.

395
00:29:14,298 --> 00:29:16,198
- Dolittle.
- Hi, Daddy.

396
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,566
- Hey, baby. How you doin'?
- Am l gonna see you before l go to camp?

397
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:23,469
l'm really workin' on it.

398
00:29:23,573 --> 00:29:25,370
Get outta here.

399
00:29:25,475 --> 00:29:28,171
- Daddy, is that a dog?
- Yeah, but it's a...

400
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:32,271
- Mommy, guess what. Daddy got me a dog.
- No! Daddy didn't...

401
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:35,341
Hey. ls that what you've
been up to, you sneak?

402
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,384
You caught me.

403
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:42,424
What? l have allergies.

404
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,323
Yeah, l guess we'll see you at camp.

405
00:29:46,296 --> 00:29:49,356
Grandpa, Daddy got me a dog.
He got me a dog.

406
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:51,924
Can you believe it? My own dog.

407
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,567
Hi.

408
00:29:55,639 --> 00:29:59,302
- They're gonna want to know your name.
- l don't have one.

409
00:29:59,376 --> 00:30:01,936
- We'll have to think of one.
- Let me see.

410
00:30:02,012 --> 00:30:06,142
A little girl once called me
''Please, Mommy, not him.'' How 'bout that?

411
00:30:06,216 --> 00:30:10,653
Nah, that's not gonna work.
You got red hair. How 'bout Lucy?

412
00:30:10,754 --> 00:30:13,314
Yes, l like that. Lucy. Just one problem.

413
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:17,019
- l'm a guy.
- Really? How 'bout Lucky?

414
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:20,654
Perfect. Lucky, yes. ''Hi, l'm Lucky.''

415
00:30:20,764 --> 00:30:23,164
Hey, it works on two levels. l love it.

416
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:25,201
Daddy!

417
00:30:25,268 --> 00:30:29,398
- That's my daughter. Be nice.
- Oh, you got me a dog. Oh, he's adorable.

418
00:30:29,473 --> 00:30:32,340
Oh, you're such a cute dog.

419
00:30:35,245 --> 00:30:37,236
- What's his name?
- Lucky.

420
00:30:37,347 --> 00:30:41,443
- Does he do any tricks?
- He does a neat trick with a thermometer.

421
00:30:41,551 --> 00:30:43,246
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.

422
00:30:43,353 --> 00:30:47,380
- You got her a dog.
- Yeah, well, l got us a dog.

423
00:30:48,258 --> 00:30:50,351
Are you OK?

424
00:30:51,228 --> 00:30:52,252
Yeah.

425
00:30:52,362 --> 00:30:54,455
Come on, let's get you all set up here.

426
00:30:54,564 --> 00:30:59,365
- Come on, Maya.
- Look at this nice rabbit on your door.

427
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,870
This is nice.

428
00:31:02,973 --> 00:31:05,168
- Yeah!
- What a fun cabin.

429
00:31:07,444 --> 00:31:09,503
You smell the air here?

430
00:31:09,646 --> 00:31:12,979
What a wonderful place.
What a wonderful camp.

431
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:15,449
Daddy, can l go home with you and Lucky?

432
00:31:17,421 --> 00:31:21,414
Hey, Maya. Look, here's the deal.

433
00:31:21,491 --> 00:31:25,484
You stay here for a while,
have a great time, then Lucky's all yours.

434
00:31:25,595 --> 00:31:28,291
Three weeks is a long time.
Can't l go home with...

435
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:31,265
No. No camp, no dog.

436
00:31:34,938 --> 00:31:37,907
- OK, l'll stay.
- You're gonna have a great time.

437
00:31:38,008 --> 00:31:43,275
When you get older you're gonna thank me,
cos you'll have so many friends. You'll see.

438
00:31:43,847 --> 00:31:45,337
You'll see.

439
00:31:51,755 --> 00:31:55,122
- What's the matter with you?
- Everything's goin' by so fast.

440
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:58,717
Don't you dare throw up in this car.
What are you lookin' at?

441
00:31:58,829 --> 00:32:01,764
The lines on the road.
They're just whippin' by.

442
00:32:01,865 --> 00:32:05,096
Lines. Line, line, line, line, line, line.

443
00:32:05,168 --> 00:32:08,569
Don't focus on somethin' so close.
Don't look at the lines.

444
00:32:09,072 --> 00:32:10,334
OK.

445
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,932
Tree, tree, tree, tree, tree, tree.

446
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:17,173
Tree, tree, tree.

447
00:32:18,348 --> 00:32:20,543
Sir, could you just...

448
00:32:22,185 --> 00:32:24,278
Who knew?

449
00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:29,950
And not only could he understand me,
but it turns out he's a doctor.

450
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,494
Look. Not even a scar.

451
00:32:32,562 --> 00:32:37,966
And it hurt so bad. l don't know
what l would have done without him.

452
00:32:38,068 --> 00:32:40,400
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yup.

453
00:32:41,471 --> 00:32:43,939
Oh, what a day.

454
00:32:44,007 --> 00:32:46,407
You have knots all over the place.

455
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:50,071
l'm all messed up. l'm fallin' apart.

456
00:32:53,783 --> 00:32:56,775
- How's that feel?
- Mrs Dolittle!

457
00:32:56,887 --> 00:32:59,185
Yeah, baby!

458
00:33:02,292 --> 00:33:04,226
- Excuse me one second.
- OK.

459
00:33:04,327 --> 00:33:06,591
Excuse me just one second.

460
00:33:07,631 --> 00:33:10,759
- Come on. Let's go.
- What a gyp.

461
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:13,962
You mind if l have a little privacy, please?

462
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:17,370
Oh, yeah, but it's fine
when people watch us do it, huh?

463
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,533
Fine to turn on the garden hose.

464
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:22,510
Hey, you want a tip on a good position?

465
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:25,514
- You were barking.
- Well, l'm excited.

466
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:28,415
When l get excited l make all kinds of sounds.

467
00:33:29,619 --> 00:33:33,146
- You never barked before.
- Oh.

468
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,060
Hello.

469
00:33:44,868 --> 00:33:49,328
- Yoo-hoo, doc. We got trouble here.
- Let's go.

470
00:33:49,406 --> 00:33:51,840
Hey! No. You take the ducks.
l'll take the goat.

471
00:33:51,942 --> 00:33:54,240
Me?

472
00:33:54,344 --> 00:33:56,471
All right. l'll get the ducks.

473
00:34:02,252 --> 00:34:03,651
What's goin' on?

474
00:34:03,787 --> 00:34:08,815
Mark just showed up. So l'm gonna have to
go over the proposal. We have to...

475
00:34:08,892 --> 00:34:10,450
- Come on!
- Don't do that.

476
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,997
Lucky wants me to take him for a walk.
So l gotta do that, then l gotta deal with Mark.

477
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:18,466
Great. l'll be the one cooking breakfast.

478
00:34:19,102 --> 00:34:20,831
Tomorrow.

479
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:25,633
Hey, Mark! How you doin'?

480
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:28,872
You're trying to destroy my life, all ofyou.
Aren't you?

481
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:31,846
Freeze! Stop right there. Don't you move.

482
00:34:31,915 --> 00:34:36,318
- What are you doin' in the hallway?
- Going to the bathroom. What are you doin'?

483
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:42,253
l'm p-p-patrolling the hallways. l'm the father.
l make sure it's safe while you're asleep.

484
00:34:42,325 --> 00:34:45,021
l patrol these halls.
You wait. Don't you move.

485
00:34:45,495 --> 00:34:50,626
The reason you're up this time of night is cos
you spend too much time drinkin' liquids.

486
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,329
You're old enough to be able to hold it in.
So go on back to bed.

487
00:34:54,437 --> 00:34:57,099
But, Dad, l have to go.

488
00:34:58,475 --> 00:35:00,705
Lucky's in the bathroom right now.

489
00:35:01,411 --> 00:35:03,470
The dog is using the bathroom?

490
00:35:13,223 --> 00:35:18,058
Let me make sure he put the seat down.
Then it's your turn, OK? Don't you move.

491
00:35:20,697 --> 00:35:24,497
- You heard of knockin'?
- Not one quack. Not one quack.

492
00:35:30,507 --> 00:35:34,967
Here's the toilet. lt's all down
like y'all like it, ready for you.

493
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:40,779
No little sprinklets on it or anything.
lt's waitin' for you to come and do your thing.

494
00:35:41,384 --> 00:35:45,115
- Dad, l don't need adult supervision.
- OK.

495
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,955
- Somebody get this thing off me.
- Come here.

496
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:52,585
Get this thing off... Whoa.

497
00:35:52,696 --> 00:35:54,459
Take it easy.

498
00:35:58,535 --> 00:36:00,901
- Night, Dad.
- Night, honey.

499
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,801
Yeah, yeah.

500
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,340
OK, let's go.
See what you almost made happen?

501
00:36:06,409 --> 00:36:09,139
What l almost made happen? What did l do?

502
00:36:09,212 --> 00:36:11,942
- Beep, beep! We're the sheep.
- Oh, no.

503
00:36:12,015 --> 00:36:14,677
- Not these clones.
- Where you goin'?

504
00:36:14,751 --> 00:36:17,618
- Move aside.
- Am l late?

505
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:20,212
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Oh, no, no.

506
00:36:20,323 --> 00:36:23,486
You gonna have to take your fat ass back...
l don't...

507
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:27,360
- Oh, my God! What a zoo.
- Obviously not a kosher establishment.

508
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:31,628
- Everybody, just come in...
- Where are the chicks? l'm cool.

509
00:36:38,308 --> 00:36:40,367
Landing! Make way.

510
00:36:43,346 --> 00:36:45,610
Very well appointed sty.

511
00:36:48,184 --> 00:36:48,218
- What's goin' on?
- Hey, there's the guy.

512
00:36:48,218 --> 00:36:51,415
- What's goin' on?
- Hey, there's the guy.

513
00:36:51,521 --> 00:36:54,251
l don't know. You know, tell a friend.

514
00:36:54,357 --> 00:36:56,985
Looks like they need to talk to a doctor, doc.

515
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,255
Our butts hurt.

516
00:37:00,263 --> 00:37:02,356
OK, let's do this.

517
00:37:02,432 --> 00:37:05,959
- Watch your droppings.
- This is the house of love.

518
00:37:06,035 --> 00:37:09,971
East coast, west coast, let's unite!
ls Brooklyn in the house?

519
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:14,339
This should take care ofthe inflammation.
But who'll wipe it on for you?

520
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,173
Does Brad Pitt need a goat?

521
00:37:16,246 --> 00:37:19,841
Don't be ashamed.
lt happens to most men occasionally.

522
00:37:19,983 --> 00:37:23,419
- You're probably under a lot of pressure.
- He's not.

523
00:37:23,486 --> 00:37:26,353
He's not interested because l'm just a pigeon.

524
00:37:26,422 --> 00:37:28,390
- But...
- He's a self-hating pigeon.

525
00:37:28,458 --> 00:37:31,450
- That is not true.
- Ask him what he does all day.

526
00:37:31,561 --> 00:37:33,688
- What do...
- l sit in a tree by myself.

527
00:37:33,897 --> 00:37:38,197
He's too good to eat with the rest of us
when the old people feed us in the park.

528
00:37:38,268 --> 00:37:41,101
- Can l speak?
- The way he stares at a robin's breast...

529
00:37:41,204 --> 00:37:45,834
- lt's enough to make you sick.
- l happen to be attracted to orange breasts.

530
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:50,039
You're not a robin. Or a dove or a hawk.
You're a pigeon and l'm a pigeon.

531
00:37:50,113 --> 00:37:55,380
l'm sorry. She sits on that nest all day long,
and she just gets a little crazy.

532
00:37:55,451 --> 00:38:00,388
May l ask you something? lf l turn this way,
don't l look a little like a blue jay?

533
00:38:00,456 --> 00:38:02,856
Poor equilibrium may mean an ear infection.

534
00:38:05,895 --> 00:38:11,800
- Or it may be due to this.
- l'm a social drinker. Very social.

535
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:14,234
Stand up. Stand up.

536
00:38:14,737 --> 00:38:18,730
- Touch your nose and raise your left foot.
- Nose. Leg.

537
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,276
l don't know. l think you're wasted.

538
00:38:23,346 --> 00:38:26,713
- l want to see you walk this line.
- Oh, my goodness.

539
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,443
Ooh-la-la!

540
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:33,287
You have a drinking problem.
l suggest that you stop drinking.

541
00:38:33,356 --> 00:38:35,449
- l think you may be an alcoholic.
- Really?

542
00:38:35,525 --> 00:38:38,494
- Nobody likes a drunk monkey.
- Sorry.

543
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:41,894
You're suffering from
obsessive-compulsive behaviour.

544
00:38:42,031 --> 00:38:43,089
Throw!

545
00:38:43,166 --> 00:38:46,533
Whenever you want the ball,
think about something else.

546
00:38:46,636 --> 00:38:49,571
- Just throw the ball.
- Can you relax your mind?

547
00:38:49,672 --> 00:38:54,336
This is the way it works. You're the person.
You throw the ball. l'm the dog. l get it.

548
00:38:54,444 --> 00:38:57,038
- Look at you goin'!
- l'll pee on your carpet.

549
00:38:57,113 --> 00:39:00,514
- lt's very irritating, this ball thing.
- Shut up and throw it.

550
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:06,078
Am l alone here? Am l by myself?
Am l in another universe?

551
00:39:06,155 --> 00:39:10,387
- Throw the damn ball.
- He threw the ball. He threw the ball.

552
00:39:10,493 --> 00:39:12,859
l'll get it. Hold on. l'll get it, l'll get it.

553
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:15,523
l love you. l love you. You threw the ball.

554
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:18,129
You can't save 'em all, Hasselhoff.

555
00:39:18,201 --> 00:39:20,396
'Ey, is there a doctor in the house?

556
00:39:22,205 --> 00:39:23,467
Up here.

557
00:39:23,539 --> 00:39:26,906
Doc, they're gonna kick me offthe force.
l'm as blind as a bat.

558
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,877
- Can you help me?
- Just gimme a minute, all right?

559
00:39:29,946 --> 00:39:32,141
- All right.
- Keep it quiet.

560
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:34,911
Tell me what you think ofthese.

561
00:39:37,487 --> 00:39:41,890
Holy road apples! l can see!
No deskjob for me.

562
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:44,518
- Thanks a million.
- You are most welcome.

563
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:50,622
This is gonna be great. l'll make lieutenant.
Nothing can stop me. Look, a doughnut shop.

564
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:50,900
Wow, what a night. All those animals.

565
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,993
Wow, what a night. All those animals.

566
00:39:53,136 --> 00:39:56,731
And l bet that's just the tip ofthe iceberg.
When word gets around...

567
00:39:56,806 --> 00:39:59,969
- Doctor, you must help us, quick.
- What happened?

568
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:02,541
lt is all my fault.
l should not have let him out.

569
00:40:02,612 --> 00:40:05,308
- Calm down.
- The circus tiger, he will jump.

570
00:40:05,415 --> 00:40:08,612
- l told you to stop drinkin'.
- Drinking. l give it up.

571
00:40:08,718 --> 00:40:12,449
- That's better. Let's go.
- Wait for me. You don't know where it is.

572
00:40:12,755 --> 00:40:15,315
And now, on the day l end it all,

573
00:40:15,391 --> 00:40:19,919
l'd like to leave Margaret the bearded lady
my rhinestone collar and my wet-dry shaver.

574
00:40:19,996 --> 00:40:24,524
l'd like to leave Jack the midget nothing.
lt's too late for you. You're a short...

575
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,433
Hey, get outta there.
You're in my landing space.

576
00:40:27,537 --> 00:40:30,438
- Man!
- See ifyou land on your feet, road kill.

577
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,338
Why don't you bloodsuckin' vermin
take a break?

578
00:40:33,743 --> 00:40:35,870
- Blood sucking!
- Look out below.

579
00:40:35,979 --> 00:40:38,038
- Hey, Lucky, come on.
- Come on what?

580
00:40:38,181 --> 00:40:41,617
- Come on. We gotta go up there.
- Are you crazy? That's a tiger.

581
00:40:41,684 --> 00:40:45,643
- l'm jumping now. Don't try and stop me.
- Will you come on?

582
00:40:45,755 --> 00:40:48,883
Comin' right up.
One order of man, side of dog.

583
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:51,657
l need a drink.

584
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:53,854
Goodbye, cruel world.

585
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:58,491
Oh, no, l just remembered.
l wanted to leave the whip to the baboon.

586
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:01,633
One ofthe few animals that enjoys that stuff.

587
00:41:01,704 --> 00:41:04,502
- Hi.
- Who are you?

588
00:41:04,807 --> 00:41:07,571
- l'm Dolittle.
- Yeah, well, get outta here.

589
00:41:07,643 --> 00:41:11,909
- l'm in a lot of pain and l'm gonnajump.
- Whoa, take it easy now.

590
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:15,883
- l'm a doctor. Maybe l can help.
- l don't need a doctor. l need a miracle.

591
00:41:15,985 --> 00:41:21,719
l'm a train wreck. l have headaches, nausea...
The worst thing is this double vision.

592
00:41:22,492 --> 00:41:26,622
What's the use?
lt's not like anybody cares about tigers.

593
00:41:26,696 --> 00:41:30,462
Now stop, you're being silly.
There have been lots of loveable tigers.

594
00:41:30,533 --> 00:41:32,626
Yeah? Name one.

595
00:41:34,337 --> 00:41:36,464
How about Tony?

596
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:40,100
- Tony the cereal tiger?
- l didn't hear you come up with anything.

597
00:41:42,278 --> 00:41:45,338
Remember that song
''Eye ofthe Tiger'' from Rocky lll?

598
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:52,548
That one from Rocky lll, when Rocky
was fightin' Mr T, couldn't beat Mr T,

599
00:41:52,655 --> 00:41:55,021
Apollo Creed played ''Eye ofthe Tiger'',

600
00:41:55,091 --> 00:42:01,052
he went back and beat the snot out of Mr T
because ofthat song. lt moved him inside.

601
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:04,429
Not ''Eye ofthe Moose'', not ''Eye ofthe Bull''.
''Eye ofthe Tiger''.

602
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,764
- That's it. l'm jumping.
- No, no, don't.

603
00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:11,329
Jump, you big pussy. l'll catch ya - not!

604
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:15,037
Didn't l say take a break?

605
00:42:15,111 --> 00:42:18,274
All right, doc. Then youjump!

606
00:42:18,347 --> 00:42:21,839
- Why do you want to help me?
- Because l'm the only one who can.

607
00:42:21,918 --> 00:42:26,480
Maybe it's my destiny. And maybe it's yours
to be the one tiger everybody remembers.

608
00:42:26,556 --> 00:42:32,358
- Why else would l be here talkin' to you?
- Cos the monkey can't keep his mouth shut.

609
00:42:32,462 --> 00:42:35,863
- Are you gonna let me help?
- What ifyou can't?

610
00:42:35,932 --> 00:42:40,266
- lf l can't help, you can eat me and Lucky.
- Yeah, orjust him.

611
00:42:40,336 --> 00:42:44,966
- Really? Will you take me back to the circus?
- l will take you back to the circus.

612
00:42:45,074 --> 00:42:49,340
All right. But don't think
l wasn't gonnajump, because l was.

613
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,608
Hope you're a better doctor
than you are a singer.

614
00:42:53,716 --> 00:42:59,518
Good job, doc. Although seein'
a tigerjump five stories would've been cool.

615
00:42:59,589 --> 00:43:01,819
l heard that.

616
00:43:02,058 --> 00:43:02,091
Hey, Dr D. Three o'clock, Calnet. Meeting to
go over the agreement. You gonna be there?

617
00:43:02,091 --> 00:43:07,586
Hey, Dr D. Three o'clock, Calnet. Meeting to
go over the agreement. You gonna be there?

618
00:43:07,697 --> 00:43:11,758
You're not gonna believe what l got for us.
Corporate cars - every two years.

619
00:43:11,834 --> 00:43:14,325
Why aren't you paying attention to me?

620
00:43:14,403 --> 00:43:19,102
Atlas ofFeline Anatomyfor Veterinarians.
But, John, we treat humans.

621
00:43:19,175 --> 00:43:22,838
Hey, Mark, sit down a second. Just a minute.

622
00:43:22,945 --> 00:43:26,642
- OK.
- Do you remember when we started out?

623
00:43:26,749 --> 00:43:31,243
We had crummy offices in the worst
neighbourhood and got paid almost nothing.

624
00:43:31,354 --> 00:43:33,345
- l've blocked it out.
- Really?

625
00:43:33,523 --> 00:43:37,118
- l guess so, yeah.
- Those were the most exciting times to me.

626
00:43:37,193 --> 00:43:41,459
lt was like, you felt like
you were making a difference, you know?

627
00:43:41,564 --> 00:43:45,432
And last night l had to treat some...
some emergencies.

628
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:48,402
And l was challenged, and it was difficult,

629
00:43:48,471 --> 00:43:51,269
and l got the same kind of rush
l had back then.

630
00:43:51,374 --> 00:43:54,810
l felt like l was doin' somethin',
like l was makin' a difference.

631
00:43:54,877 --> 00:44:01,043
And l started thinkin' that here l'm not giving
my patients the right amount of attention.

632
00:44:01,851 --> 00:44:06,345
Do me a favour. Don't confide in me.
l'm utterly useless. l'm very self-absorbed.

633
00:44:06,422 --> 00:44:08,481
Let's get Geno.

634
00:44:08,591 --> 00:44:10,456
Hey, Geno?

635
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,792
You did yourjob just by pretending
you were listening. lt was very helpful.

636
00:44:14,864 --> 00:44:16,957
- Any time.
- OK.

637
00:44:18,067 --> 00:44:21,901
- Calnet, three o'clock.
- Three o'clock sharp.

638
00:44:30,513 --> 00:44:34,574
- This is Dr Fish.
- The author of Feline lllnesses andDiseases?

639
00:44:34,884 --> 00:44:37,045
Yes it is. You've read my book?

640
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,613
Have l read your book? l sleep with
your book next to your bed. lt's my bible.

641
00:44:41,691 --> 00:44:46,890
Well, some people consider it
the definitive work on cats, but

642
00:44:46,996 --> 00:44:50,090
bible? l... l... l...

643
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:52,599
Well, no, l can... l can see your point.

644
00:44:52,668 --> 00:44:57,105
Dr Fish, l have a very very sick,
very very big cat.

645
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,871
l'm concerneditmightbe serious
because his vision's impaired.

646
00:45:01,944 --> 00:45:04,344
And he seems to be in a lot ofpain.

647
00:45:04,447 --> 00:45:08,474
Unfortunately,
ifitis in the head there's only two options.

648
00:45:08,551 --> 00:45:12,612
One is surgery
and the otheris putting it down.

649
00:45:14,557 --> 00:45:16,821
l have no idea how l'm gonna do this.

650
00:45:16,892 --> 00:45:21,955
- l'm gonna try to take care ofyou. l promise.
- Just hurry back.

651
00:45:22,064 --> 00:45:25,295
Every minute you're gone
l'm one minute closer to death.

652
00:45:25,434 --> 00:45:28,767
l just might hang myself by my underpants.

653
00:45:28,871 --> 00:45:31,135
l can get underpants.

654
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,571
Not really.

655
00:45:32,675 --> 00:45:36,042
- He blew offthe Calloway meeting.
- l don't care about that.

656
00:45:36,112 --> 00:45:40,981
l need to speak with John.
You wouldn't believe what's goin' on here.

657
00:45:45,488 --> 00:45:47,285
Doc!

658
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:50,518
You gotta help me. He's dead.
You gotta help me.

659
00:45:51,727 --> 00:45:54,890
- He's not dead.
- Oh, no, no, don't go, old buddy, old pal.

660
00:45:54,964 --> 00:45:57,990
- You gotta help him.
- Really? Why's that?

661
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,263
Cos... cos... cos you're the man.
You're the man!

662
00:46:01,337 --> 00:46:04,397
Oh? l thought l was the guy
you wanted to get bubonic with.

663
00:46:04,507 --> 00:46:07,908
- l'm going towards the light now.
- l was kiddin'. We were riffin'.

664
00:46:07,977 --> 00:46:10,946
Serious? Come on!

665
00:46:11,013 --> 00:46:13,538
Goodbye, world. l smell flowers.

666
00:46:13,616 --> 00:46:16,881
l'm begging you. Don't let him die.
Don't let my buddy go.

667
00:46:16,952 --> 00:46:19,147
l'm sinking fast.

668
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:22,885
- John...! Where have you been?
- Hi.

669
00:46:22,958 --> 00:46:24,892
- What?
- The meeting.

670
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,588
l had an emergency. Excuse me. Sorry.

671
00:46:27,697 --> 00:46:29,528
Excuse you!

672
00:46:29,598 --> 00:46:32,726
- Hang in there, brother.
- Does it hurt when l do this?

673
00:46:32,802 --> 00:46:35,532
- lt ain't no day at the dump.
- lf he dies

674
00:46:35,604 --> 00:46:37,765
- l don't know what l'll do.
- He'll eat me.

675
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,638
Only out of respect.

676
00:46:40,743 --> 00:46:43,337
Be quiet. l can't hear while you're talkin'.

677
00:46:43,446 --> 00:46:45,641
- Sorry, doc.
- John.

678
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:50,346
He said he was suffering
from abdominal cramps.

679
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,578
''He said''?

680
00:46:52,655 --> 00:46:56,716
l wouldn't be working on this rat
unless it was an emergency. Take a look.

681
00:46:58,794 --> 00:47:02,457
- What happened?
- He's gone into arrest. l don't feel a pulse.

682
00:47:02,565 --> 00:47:05,557
- Oh, my God, he's a goner.
- He's not breathing.

683
00:47:05,634 --> 00:47:08,068
- Johnny.
- Maybe we should shock him, huh?

684
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:11,970
- l don't know.
- The paddles'll be too big. He needs CPR.

685
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:15,636
- You know how to do CPR?
- l can't even spell it.

686
00:47:15,745 --> 00:47:19,146
- OK.
- l can't even look. Doc, no.

687
00:47:19,215 --> 00:47:21,683
- No, Johnny.
- For Chrissakes.

688
00:47:21,784 --> 00:47:26,949
You didn't even wine him or dine him, doc.
l think my friend would rather die.

689
00:47:27,022 --> 00:47:29,081
No tongue, doc.

690
00:47:30,693 --> 00:47:33,218
- Come on. l got no pulse.
- Doc, do somethin'.

691
00:47:33,295 --> 00:47:35,661
- John...
- Not now.

692
00:47:35,765 --> 00:47:38,097
- Honey...
- Lisa, please!

693
00:47:40,503 --> 00:47:42,164
l'm hungry.

694
00:47:42,238 --> 00:47:46,572
lt's a false alarm. There's nothing wrong
with him. He just has gas.

695
00:47:46,642 --> 00:47:49,702
- Whoa, you're telling me!
- He just had gas.

696
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:54,115
You're back.
l don't care ifyou stink. l love ya, pal.

697
00:47:54,216 --> 00:47:57,674
Thanks a lot, little buddy. l felt your presence.

698
00:47:58,521 --> 00:48:01,820
Lisa, stop lookin' at me like that.

699
00:48:07,329 --> 00:48:09,524
John Dolittle.

700
00:48:10,299 --> 00:48:15,100
Who'd have ever thought
you would end up in a mental institution?

701
00:48:15,204 --> 00:48:18,332
Number one in our medical school class.

702
00:48:18,441 --> 00:48:23,071
Not that l'm jealous, John.
Someone had to finish first.

703
00:48:23,145 --> 00:48:26,137
And someone had to finish last too.

704
00:48:27,049 --> 00:48:30,314
So, John. You talk to animals now, do ya?

705
00:48:31,287 --> 00:48:35,314
Would you like to tell me about it?
Or would you rather tell Bettelheim?

706
00:48:36,325 --> 00:48:41,092
- l don't need to talk to your cat, Blain.
- Why? Do you think he'd talk back to you?

707
00:48:41,163 --> 00:48:44,929
- You know, he just might.
- And what would he say?

708
00:48:45,034 --> 00:48:47,366
l'd say you were a butthead.

709
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,933
l really like this cat.

710
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:57,643
He's recommending you stay
a minimum often days.

711
00:48:57,713 --> 00:49:01,740
You really think l need to be here
for that long?

712
00:49:02,785 --> 00:49:05,686
You said that you can talk to animals.

713
00:49:07,156 --> 00:49:09,386
You know, l can really hear 'em.

714
00:49:10,893 --> 00:49:13,088
l can.

715
00:49:13,162 --> 00:49:15,255
You gotta believe me.

716
00:49:16,699 --> 00:49:18,758
l can't.

717
00:49:27,743 --> 00:49:30,473
Here you go. Your medicine.

718
00:49:33,182 --> 00:49:34,911
OK, then.

719
00:49:37,887 --> 00:49:40,913
l can get you anything you need.
Saucers, coasters...

720
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:42,514
Go away.

721
00:49:42,625 --> 00:49:45,219
lf you have any extra medication
l could use it.

722
00:49:45,327 --> 00:49:48,023
You're not following me, are you? Whoa.

723
00:49:49,431 --> 00:49:53,993
- Now, what is all this?
- This is to prove to me and the world

724
00:49:54,103 --> 00:49:56,435
that you can actually talk to animals.

725
00:49:56,539 --> 00:50:01,772
Now, the orang-utan is attached to
this brain-wave monitor.

726
00:50:02,344 --> 00:50:06,007
Normally he responds to
visual stimulation, but

727
00:50:06,115 --> 00:50:11,849
since you have got the gift of gab, you won't
need pictures to make him respond, will ya?

728
00:50:11,954 --> 00:50:14,514
Get acquainted, John.

729
00:50:15,824 --> 00:50:20,454
OK, listen. l need your help. l need you
to make that needle over there move,

730
00:50:20,563 --> 00:50:23,657
cos ifyou don't
they'll make me stay here for ever. OK?

731
00:50:23,766 --> 00:50:27,167
So just make the little needle jump.

732
00:50:28,971 --> 00:50:30,165
Come on.

733
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,266
l know you can hear me now, so don't play.
This is very serious right now.

734
00:50:35,044 --> 00:50:37,979
l guess he's just not a big talker, John.

735
00:50:38,581 --> 00:50:42,415
Look, gimme a break. Say somethin', please.

736
00:50:51,994 --> 00:50:54,656
Please escort Dr Dolittle back to his room.

737
00:51:02,972 --> 00:51:05,702
Wait. You speak Spanish?

738
00:51:05,808 --> 00:51:09,437
That's why he couldn't understand.
He's from south ofthe border.

739
00:51:09,511 --> 00:51:13,709
- Remove him. Go.
- Turn that machine back on.

740
00:51:13,816 --> 00:51:15,579
Spanish...

741
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:22,048
l'm worried, John.

742
00:51:22,124 --> 00:51:26,458
Who are you trying to fool?
You're worrying about Calnet.

743
00:51:26,862 --> 00:51:29,330
John l admit it.

744
00:51:29,431 --> 00:51:32,195
l want the money. l'm not ashamed ofthat.

745
00:51:32,267 --> 00:51:35,236
Look, here's what l want you to do for me.

746
00:51:35,304 --> 00:51:38,239
Just stop barking and chirping for one day.

747
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:40,832
lf you do, l'm pretty sure
you can get out of here.

748
00:51:40,909 --> 00:51:43,275
And that'd be a really good idea,

749
00:51:43,345 --> 00:51:48,942
because Calloway said ifyou're not back
for Friday's press conference, the deal's off.

750
00:51:49,051 --> 00:51:53,750
lf you would do that for me, Johnny,
l'll buy you a rat farm.

751
00:51:53,856 --> 00:51:58,623
And you can... you can burp and fart
the little rats till you pass out.

752
00:51:58,727 --> 00:52:02,254
But let's just get it signed. OK, my shot.

753
00:52:09,471 --> 00:52:11,735
Pick it up. Pick the phone up, please.

754
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,241
Hi. We're nothere. Leave a message.

755
00:52:15,310 --> 00:52:17,369
Hey. Hi, it's me.

756
00:52:19,481 --> 00:52:22,314
l'm really startin' to miss you guys.

757
00:52:22,384 --> 00:52:25,785
l'm startin' to wonder what l'm doin' here too.

758
00:52:25,888 --> 00:52:28,914
Maybe you were right.
Maybe it was all my imagination.

759
00:52:28,991 --> 00:52:31,323
- Hey, honey, feelin' better?
- Who's this?

760
00:52:31,393 --> 00:52:35,853
l'll give you a hint. l'm cute, l'm furry
and l make 500 babies a year.

761
00:52:36,298 --> 00:52:38,357
Rodney. Get back in your cage.

762
00:52:38,467 --> 00:52:41,994
What's up with that trap behind the fridge?
You tryin' to kill me?

763
00:52:42,104 --> 00:52:45,335
Never mind that.
Get your little furry ass back in your cage.

764
00:52:45,407 --> 00:52:47,875
Now. l don't want your droppings on...

765
00:52:48,711 --> 00:52:50,576
Bye-bye.

766
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:53,580
My son Rodney.
Little hairy boy, sleeps in the cage.

767
00:52:53,682 --> 00:52:57,709
l have to keep him in the cage
cos he has hygiene problems.

768
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,513
He's not coming back.

769
00:53:01,023 --> 00:53:03,958
l can't believe l fell for it.

770
00:53:04,493 --> 00:53:08,395
- Oh, boy, l'm getting dizzy.
- Man, you don't look so good.

771
00:53:08,497 --> 00:53:11,364
Look who's talking!
What do the three ofyou know?

772
00:53:12,801 --> 00:53:14,894
l'm in bad shape.

773
00:53:15,804 --> 00:53:17,328
My head!

774
00:53:17,406 --> 00:53:19,533
What kind ofa name is Edfora horse?

775
00:53:19,608 --> 00:53:22,600
What kind ofa name is Wilburfora man?

776
00:53:22,711 --> 00:53:26,112
Peanut butter. That's how they
got the horse to move his lips.

777
00:53:26,181 --> 00:53:29,207
- ln the back ofthe mouth.
- l disagree, sir.

778
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:31,752
- Side. The side.
- Look, look. See his jaw?

779
00:53:31,854 --> 00:53:34,152
- See? See?
- The oesophagus, yes.

780
00:53:34,223 --> 00:53:37,124
- He's not talking. That's an act.
- No, no, no.

781
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:44,031
Finish what you were talking about.

782
00:53:44,133 --> 00:53:46,863
- No, he's...
- Full teeth. Full teeth.

783
00:53:46,969 --> 00:53:48,561
Doc. Out here.

784
00:53:48,637 --> 00:53:50,832
Doc. Hey, over here.

785
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:00,141
What are you doin' here?

786
00:54:00,215 --> 00:54:05,278
l crossed three freeways to rescue you,
and all l get is ''What are you doing here?''

787
00:54:05,754 --> 00:54:09,087
- This isn't a prison. lt's a clinic.
- The tiger's in bad shape.

788
00:54:09,191 --> 00:54:11,785
The tiger? Listen, forget the tiger.

789
00:54:11,894 --> 00:54:15,762
l had a perfect life until you came along
and started talkin' to me.

790
00:54:15,864 --> 00:54:19,095
Now l'm sittin' here in a robe
discussin' Mr Ed with these guys.

791
00:54:19,201 --> 00:54:22,193
You've ruined my life enough. Just go away.

792
00:54:22,271 --> 00:54:24,705
Just get outta here, please. This is crazy.

793
00:54:25,007 --> 00:54:28,033
l get it.
Now it's crazy to want to save a tiger's life.

794
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:30,840
Listen, tigers die every day.
lt's called nature.

795
00:54:30,913 --> 00:54:35,179
Let me tell you a little about nature.
l'm a dog, and l act like a dog.

796
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,878
l don't try to be anybody else.
We are who we are.

797
00:54:37,986 --> 00:54:42,389
And you are a doctor who can talk to animals.
That's who you are.

798
00:54:42,457 --> 00:54:45,426
- That is not who l am.
- Stop lying to yourself.

799
00:54:45,494 --> 00:54:48,622
Didn't l tell you to get outta here?
Go. Get outta here.

800
00:54:48,697 --> 00:54:50,460
- Get outta here.
- Fine.

801
00:54:50,532 --> 00:54:53,399
- Stop talkin' to me.
- With pleasure.

802
00:54:53,468 --> 00:54:56,301
You better not come back.

803
00:54:56,905 --> 00:54:59,203
- Bonehead.
- That's all ofyou.

804
00:54:59,675 --> 00:55:02,041
Leave me alone. Stop talkin' to me.

805
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:04,670
Ruined his life. That's a laugh.

806
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,894
- OK, Blain, look. l wanna go home.
- So soon? And miss the field trip to the zoo?

807
00:55:30,472 --> 00:55:33,305
Listen.
You've hated me since medical school,

808
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:36,310
but we are both adults now.
Let's put that behind us.

809
00:55:36,378 --> 00:55:39,711
We both have families.
l want to get back to mine. How do l do that?

810
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:44,275
Well, it's very simple.
Stop talking to animals, John.

811
00:55:44,353 --> 00:55:45,445
Simple.

812
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,455
All right, listen.
You're right. l made a mistake.

813
00:55:48,523 --> 00:55:54,120
Maybe it was a case oftemporary insanity,
but it's over. l don't talk to animals any more.

814
00:55:55,530 --> 00:56:00,331
l'm not convinced.
We'll talk again in a month or so, OK?

815
00:56:01,336 --> 00:56:04,169
Tell you what, Blain.
You sign my release form

816
00:56:04,273 --> 00:56:09,267
and l won't tell our fellow-doctor friends
about that pink tutu you keep in your closet.

817
00:56:09,344 --> 00:56:11,972
With the thong back.

818
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:24,718
- Daddy's home.
- Daddy? Hey, Daddy.

819
00:56:24,793 --> 00:56:28,695
- Hey, beautiful, how are you?
- Oh, l'm fine.

820
00:56:28,764 --> 00:56:31,130
- Hey, baby.
- Wh...?

821
00:56:31,767 --> 00:56:35,726
- Why didn't you call me?
- l wanted to surprise you.

822
00:56:35,804 --> 00:56:40,002
- Hey, why aren't you in camp, young lady?
- Mom brought her home.

823
00:56:41,043 --> 00:56:43,910
l didn't fit in.

824
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:49,812
You're just gonna have to try a little harder
next year. Gimme a hug. l missed you.

825
00:56:49,918 --> 00:56:52,409
- Still Daddy's baby, huh?
- Honey?

826
00:56:52,521 --> 00:56:54,921
Do they know that you left?

827
00:56:55,023 --> 00:57:00,017
No, l escaped. Of course they know l left.
l'm better. Time to spend some time with you.

828
00:57:00,862 --> 00:57:03,023
Are you not talkin' to me?

829
00:57:03,131 --> 00:57:05,725
- You're sure you're OK?
- Yeah, l'm fine.

830
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:09,168
Cos l got scared,
wonderin' when you were comin' home.

831
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:14,405
Well, l am back and l'm fine, and everything's
gonna be just like it was in the old days.

832
00:57:14,476 --> 00:57:19,072
l know what you're doin'. Two can play at
that game. l don't have to listen to you either.

833
00:57:19,181 --> 00:57:22,150
l was thinkin' maybe
we should get rid ofthat dog.

834
00:57:22,217 --> 00:57:27,450
Comin' home empty-handed...! Don't tell me
there wasn't a gift shop at the loony bin.

835
00:57:28,156 --> 00:57:32,183
Diane, please call down to Radiology
and get me the x-rays on Mr Galvin.

836
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:36,094
Also, see if Mrs Rivers
can switch her appointment to 3.15.

837
00:57:36,198 --> 00:57:39,099
- l may need Gene for a consultation.
- Yes, Doctor.

838
00:57:39,468 --> 00:57:43,427
Gene can you check your schedule
and see ifyou can do a 3.15 consult?

839
00:57:43,505 --> 00:57:45,439
- Sure.
- Good. And Mark.

840
00:57:45,507 --> 00:57:49,773
- Did you get back the tests on Mr Freeman?
- l think they're comin' in this afternoon.

841
00:57:49,845 --> 00:57:52,780
Good. Keep me informed, OK?

842
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:56,443
Hey, doc, do you think
l should get my beak done?

843
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:02,646
Tell Maintenance we need to put some
permanent screens up, set some traps.

844
00:58:02,724 --> 00:58:06,285
This is a doctor's office, not a zoo.

845
00:58:06,395 --> 00:58:09,091
He's back. We're gonna be rich.

846
00:58:12,534 --> 00:58:17,335
This is where he lives,
and this is where he exercises.

847
00:58:17,439 --> 00:58:21,432
- Does he do aerobics?
- Yeah, the guinea pig aerobics.

848
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:26,345
Let's get this show on the road. Put that thing
away. You're gonna get your dress dirty.

849
00:58:26,448 --> 00:58:28,541
Pop, help out. l can't be late for this.

850
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:31,619
- But Rodney wants to come.
- Rodney cannot come.

851
00:58:31,686 --> 00:58:34,883
This is a press conference for people.
No animals allowed.

852
00:58:34,956 --> 00:58:39,325
- Why don't you tell him? He'll listen to you.
- No, l am not going to tell him.

853
00:58:43,432 --> 00:58:45,957
Help out.

854
00:58:47,369 --> 00:58:48,893
Come on, Pop.

855
00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:51,564
- Can l tell you a secret?
- Yes.

856
00:58:52,941 --> 00:58:57,469
When Mommy told me what happened
to Daddy, l wasn't afraid - l was happy.

857
00:58:57,546 --> 00:59:00,947
Because l believed
that he can talk to animals.

858
00:59:01,049 --> 00:59:04,143
Cos l wanted Dad to be weird. Like me.

859
00:59:04,252 --> 00:59:07,346
- ls that wrong?
- No. No, it's not wrong.

860
00:59:07,456 --> 00:59:10,323
lt's just, sometimes
l don't think he likes me much.

861
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:13,887
Honey, he loves you.

862
00:59:14,262 --> 00:59:17,720
l know he loves me. l don't think he likes me.

863
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:21,167
And l really want him to.

864
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:23,499
l'm gonna try to do things his way.

865
00:59:24,539 --> 00:59:27,667
And stop doing these stupid experiments.

866
00:59:29,878 --> 00:59:31,937
No, Maya.

867
00:59:32,781 --> 00:59:35,011
Don't stop your experiments.

868
00:59:36,184 --> 00:59:41,144
Sometimes daddies are the ones
who need to change.

869
00:59:53,902 --> 00:59:58,965
- Let me park this car.
- All right. Come on, girls. Let's go.

870
00:59:59,441 --> 01:00:01,909
Maya. Let me talk to you a second.

871
01:00:01,977 --> 01:00:05,174
- We'll be in there in a second.
- OK.

872
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,340
Hey, listen.

873
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:11,216
l don't think your egg is a stupid idea.
lt's kinda cool.

874
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:13,048
- You do?
- Yes.

875
01:00:13,188 --> 01:00:16,749
You have curiosity and ideas,
and that's what makes you special.

876
01:00:16,825 --> 01:00:20,261
- You mean weird.
- l didn't say weird. l said special.

877
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:27,026
Being weird's not so bad. A lot ofthe greatest
people in history were considered weird.

878
01:00:27,169 --> 01:00:30,229
- Like who?
- Lots of people. Albert Einstein.

879
01:00:30,338 --> 01:00:35,571
With his crazy hair, people thought he was
weird. A guy that smart was weird to people.

880
01:00:35,644 --> 01:00:39,410
Muhammad Ali, when he said what round
he was gonna knock out people in

881
01:00:39,481 --> 01:00:43,611
and screamed ''l'm the greatest.''
People thought that was super-weird.

882
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:47,348
- And Joan ofArc, she heard voices.
- Like you, Daddy?

883
01:00:49,591 --> 01:00:51,650
Yeah, like me.

884
01:00:52,594 --> 01:00:57,793
Listen, this is what l'm tryin' to tell you.
No matter what happens, you be who you are.

885
01:00:57,866 --> 01:01:00,198
And you love who you are.

886
01:01:01,236 --> 01:01:03,295
Cos l love you.

887
01:01:05,674 --> 01:01:07,801
Gimme a kiss.

888
01:01:09,244 --> 01:01:09,835
Yes.

889
01:01:09,911 --> 01:01:13,005
- You know, you're a great person.
- Oh, thank you.

890
01:01:13,081 --> 01:01:16,073
And a weird one too.

891
01:01:16,218 --> 01:01:18,686
- See you inside.
- OK.

892
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:32,297
That was beautiful, man.

893
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,892
- Lucky! What are you doin' here?
- Do you have a tissue?

894
01:01:36,004 --> 01:01:39,337
Yes, l do.
Right in the back in that pocket over there.

895
01:01:39,441 --> 01:01:42,137
Listen. l'm sorry l ignored you
back at the house.

896
01:01:44,145 --> 01:01:47,114
You were the one who said
''Be who you are.'' You were right.

897
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:53,415
Put me back in touch with the part of me
that l'd forgotten years ago, Lucky.

898
01:01:54,889 --> 01:01:57,881
Can you take it easy?
l'm tryin' to say somethin'.

899
01:01:57,959 --> 01:02:01,451
- Well, then just say it.
- l'm trying to say it.

900
01:02:01,529 --> 01:02:04,657
- What do you think l'm tryin' to say?
- ''l love you, Lucky.''

901
01:02:04,733 --> 01:02:07,293
- That's not what l'm tryin' to say.
- Yes, it is.

902
01:02:07,369 --> 01:02:09,462
That is not what l'm tryin' to tell you.

903
01:02:09,537 --> 01:02:13,268
Come on. Deep down inside
that's exactly what you want to say.

904
01:02:13,341 --> 01:02:16,276
Come on, now.
You'll feel a lot better. Come on.

905
01:02:16,344 --> 01:02:19,711
Let it out. Go ahead. You know it. l know it.

906
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:22,375
- l love you.
- You love me?

907
01:02:23,518 --> 01:02:25,645
l'm gonna need another tissue.

908
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,917
- Where are we offto?
- We are offto ruin my life.

909
01:02:31,526 --> 01:02:34,086
Wake up!

910
01:02:35,063 --> 01:02:37,930
Hey, doc. You came back.

911
01:02:38,566 --> 01:02:40,761
You need help. l wanna take you for tests.

912
01:02:40,869 --> 01:02:44,999
- Tests? That's good, right? Tests?
- Yeah. Come on.

913
01:02:46,941 --> 01:02:49,102
l hate these stairs.

914
01:02:49,711 --> 01:02:52,407
Take good care of him, doc. He's our star.

915
01:02:52,514 --> 01:02:54,311
He'll be OK.

916
01:02:54,382 --> 01:02:56,577
- Great. More steps.
- Come on. Get in.

917
01:02:58,386 --> 01:03:01,947
Wait a minute. The dog gets to ride up front?

918
01:03:02,023 --> 01:03:06,187
- Stop looking at me like l'm a side dish.
- Don't flatter yourself.

919
01:03:06,328 --> 01:03:09,354
- Now, you two guys shut up. Quiet.
- Hey, look. Jerry.

920
01:03:09,431 --> 01:03:12,025
- Can you keep your voice down?
- He's a big fan.

921
01:03:12,133 --> 01:03:16,729
Hey, Jerry. How you doin', dude?
Just goin' for some tests.

922
01:03:17,739 --> 01:03:21,231
l'm fine! ''The tiger's fine.'' l'm sick.

923
01:03:22,644 --> 01:03:25,909
- l told you they'd get away.
- No thanks to you.

924
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:29,848
No? Three armed guards
versus a pigeon - that's a fair fight?

925
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:36,388
He's not at home and he's not
answering his pager. l'm worried.

926
01:03:36,925 --> 01:03:38,358
- Mom.
- Yes?

927
01:03:38,426 --> 01:03:41,554
Guess who Maya brought to the party.

928
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:44,464
Rodney. Rodney, there you are.

929
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:48,264
- Man...
- Where the hell is Dolittle?

930
01:03:48,403 --> 01:03:53,238
You know, l just talked to him. He stopped
at an orphanage to take care of a sick child.

931
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:57,175
That is so John. lt's so typical ofthe man.
He just cares.

932
01:03:57,245 --> 01:04:03,480
Weller. Take your lips off my butt
long enough to hear what l'm going to say.

933
01:04:03,585 --> 01:04:07,783
lf Dolittle's not here in ten minutes,

934
01:04:07,856 --> 01:04:10,222
- l'm pulling the plug.
- You won't have to.

935
01:04:10,291 --> 01:04:12,657
He's gonna be here in five minutes.

936
01:04:12,761 --> 01:04:17,198
- l hope so.
- He will be. He'll be here in five minutes.

937
01:04:19,033 --> 01:04:21,058
Hey.

938
01:04:21,169 --> 01:04:25,401
Where's the kitchenette? l gotta get in here.
Where's the food?

939
01:04:26,608 --> 01:04:29,634
- Rodney.
- She's comin' to get me.

940
01:04:30,278 --> 01:04:32,405
Rodney.

941
01:04:40,422 --> 01:04:44,119
- Who's Rodney?
- Sorry.

942
01:04:49,297 --> 01:04:53,495
This ain't no kitchen. Smell bad.
Must be cookin' chitlins.

943
01:04:56,471 --> 01:04:59,065
Now what's this for?

944
01:05:01,743 --> 01:05:03,836
Somebody help me.

945
01:05:08,049 --> 01:05:10,108
l can't swim.

946
01:05:12,821 --> 01:05:14,652
Aaaggghhh yourself!

947
01:05:21,029 --> 01:05:24,430
Where you goin'? Get me outta here.

948
01:05:27,902 --> 01:05:33,738
Somebody get the license plate number.
l have just been violated.

949
01:05:43,952 --> 01:05:47,649
- This is where you work?
- Come on.

950
01:05:51,459 --> 01:05:56,954
Don't throw that away. That's
the marrow - it's the best part ofthe bone.

951
01:05:58,132 --> 01:06:01,693
- Look who's here.
- Well, if it isn't Siegfried and Roy!

952
01:06:01,769 --> 01:06:02,929
Quiet.

953
01:06:03,004 --> 01:06:06,667
- Lucky, keep an eye out. You rats help him.
- We don't work for you.

954
01:06:06,741 --> 01:06:10,336
- Gimme a break. l saved your life.
- That's yesterday's news.

955
01:06:11,312 --> 01:06:13,371
You want gratitude, get a hamster.

956
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:16,882
''Get a hamster.'' You kill me!

957
01:06:16,951 --> 01:06:18,578
l gotta get help.

958
01:06:18,686 --> 01:06:21,621
Yeah, l got a plate lD on the catnapper.

959
01:06:21,723 --> 01:06:23,588
Do something.

960
01:06:23,691 --> 01:06:26,683
The heart of a hawk.
The heart of a hawk.

961
01:06:26,761 --> 01:06:30,629
- A chicken hawk
- The heart of a hawk.

962
01:06:41,242 --> 01:06:43,972
That feels good.

963
01:06:44,045 --> 01:06:48,379
l enjoy my personal relationships
with my patients.

964
01:06:48,516 --> 01:06:51,041
- You'll get over that.
- l just might not.

965
01:06:51,152 --> 01:06:53,313
l'm joking. Gene, l'm...

966
01:06:54,722 --> 01:07:00,820
This is the kind of guy who would rather be
trudging through the snow with a black bag

967
01:07:00,929 --> 01:07:03,659
- makin' house calls.
- Exactly.

968
01:07:05,433 --> 01:07:08,061
- That hurt me.
- Oh, my gosh, l'm sorry.

969
01:07:08,169 --> 01:07:11,036
- l may have broken my nose.
- l think l broke his nose.

970
01:07:11,139 --> 01:07:13,334
- ls it broken?
- Let me check.

971
01:07:13,408 --> 01:07:16,434
Oh, my God! l broke his nose.

972
01:07:17,078 --> 01:07:20,570
- Let me take him to X-ray.
- l'm blackin' out.

973
01:07:29,857 --> 01:07:36,023
Thaaaat feeeeels goooood!

974
01:07:37,098 --> 01:07:39,999
- This really hurts. l think...
- Of course it hurts.

975
01:07:40,068 --> 01:07:42,263
You walked right into a door.

976
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:44,463
Oh, God, l'm bleeding.

977
01:07:44,606 --> 01:07:47,803
l'm bleeding.
Do we have any morphine in the vault?

978
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:50,002
- Hey, guys.
- John.

979
01:07:50,378 --> 01:07:52,778
- What happened to you?
- l walked into a door.

980
01:07:52,847 --> 01:07:55,179
- l crushed his septum.
- Really?

981
01:07:55,249 --> 01:07:58,685
Look, this is not really a good time.
l'm kinda

982
01:07:58,786 --> 01:08:00,879
- here with somebody.
- Oh, my God.

983
01:08:00,989 --> 01:08:04,857
l-l-l do not approve.
Lisa is a wonderful woman!

984
01:08:06,828 --> 01:08:08,261
- Jesus.
- lt's OK.

985
01:08:08,329 --> 01:08:10,422
- lt's a friggin' tiger.
- He won't hurt you.

986
01:08:11,633 --> 01:08:14,830
- l know him.
- Be afraid. Be very afraid.

987
01:08:14,902 --> 01:08:17,393
Oh, my goodness. l have to sit.

988
01:08:19,474 --> 01:08:23,308
Here's what we do. We tell Johnny
we're gonna fix his little tiger up

989
01:08:23,411 --> 01:08:25,504
after he signs. OK?

990
01:08:25,647 --> 01:08:29,743
Then we'll have him committed.
lt's perfect! That way we get our money.

991
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:39,119
lt's shifted to the left.
So there's something applying pressure to it.

992
01:08:39,227 --> 01:08:43,425
You can't operate on a tiger.
Especially as you don't know the symptoms.

993
01:08:43,498 --> 01:08:48,060
- Double vision and headaches. He told me.
- You'll wind up back at Hammersmith's.

994
01:08:48,136 --> 01:08:50,070
l've been supportive,

995
01:08:50,138 --> 01:08:53,904
but ifyou expect me to believe
that a tiger told you his symptoms,

996
01:08:54,308 --> 01:08:56,538
l might have to draw the line.

997
01:08:58,646 --> 01:09:01,137
You have to do something. Quick.

998
01:09:01,249 --> 01:09:04,548
We gotta get him into OR fast.
lt's the only chance he's got.

999
01:09:04,686 --> 01:09:07,780
What about the press conference?

1000
01:09:07,889 --> 01:09:10,289
20 bucks says this guy never shows.

1001
01:09:10,358 --> 01:09:13,657
Watch your back.
Trying to get to the operating room.

1002
01:09:13,728 --> 01:09:19,360
- Outta the way, please.
- Clear a spot. We have an emergency here.

1003
01:09:19,467 --> 01:09:22,095
Clear the way, please. Comin' through.

1004
01:09:22,170 --> 01:09:26,539
- There you are. Let's do this.
- Mr Calloway, Mark broke his nose.

1005
01:09:26,674 --> 01:09:30,770
- The nose can wait. The press is waiting.
- l-l-l-l...

1006
01:09:30,878 --> 01:09:35,315
- We're announcing.
- l really don't know ifwe should...

1007
01:09:36,384 --> 01:09:38,579
- Where were you?
- l'll explain.

1008
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:43,589
Thank you all for coming,
and thank you all for being so patient.

1009
01:09:43,725 --> 01:09:48,355
As you all know, the practice of medicine
and the business of medicine

1010
01:09:48,429 --> 01:09:52,092
have been undergoing
very big changes in this country.

1011
01:09:52,166 --> 01:09:56,227
We at Calnet strive to be
at the forefront ofthese changes.

1012
01:09:56,337 --> 01:09:59,898
That is why l'm proud to announce
the acquisition of...

1013
01:09:59,974 --> 01:10:04,138
This is the life! Hot wings, nuts.
l love nuts.

1014
01:10:05,046 --> 01:10:08,709
Oh, my! Live prey.

1015
01:10:15,056 --> 01:10:19,459
- That's a big cat!
- lt's all right. lt's OK.

1016
01:10:19,961 --> 01:10:22,521
lt's OK. He's not gonna hurt anybody.

1017
01:10:23,998 --> 01:10:26,057
He's just a very, very sick tiger.

1018
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:29,261
You'd better have a rational
explanation for all this.

1019
01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:34,569
Mr Calloway, l don't have a rational
explanation. l wish l did, but l don't.

1020
01:10:34,842 --> 01:10:39,370
Right now l got a sick tiger on my hands. l'm
gonna try to save it. That's all that matters.

1021
01:10:39,447 --> 01:10:41,608
Dolittle, you go through with this...

1022
01:10:46,154 --> 01:10:48,486
So ifyou'll excuse me...

1023
01:10:50,224 --> 01:10:52,988
- Stupid cat. Ruined the party.
- Shut up.

1024
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:55,893
What do you mean, shut up?
l was gonna do karaoke!

1025
01:11:10,077 --> 01:11:12,807
What the hell is this?

1026
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,713
- No more bacon.
- One, two, three, four.

1027
01:11:15,817 --> 01:11:18,911
You ain't gettin' through this door.

1028
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:21,113
Make love, not war.

1029
01:11:21,656 --> 01:11:24,784
Fur is murder. Free Willy.

1030
01:11:24,859 --> 01:11:29,262
Pigs go home. Pigs go home. Pigs go home.

1031
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:30,627
Huh?

1032
01:11:30,731 --> 01:11:33,131
No, no, not you. The police.

1033
01:11:33,234 --> 01:11:35,464
Wow, this is great.

1034
01:11:35,536 --> 01:11:38,903
- Are you OK?
- The man's comin' down hard, but

1035
01:11:39,006 --> 01:11:42,533
- we're holdin' strong.
- l got such a chill.

1036
01:11:42,643 --> 01:11:45,669
l'm gonna give you a local.
lt's not gonna hurt.

1037
01:11:45,813 --> 01:11:48,304
lt'll feel like a little bee sting.

1038
01:11:48,416 --> 01:11:51,852
A little pressure. That's about it.

1039
01:11:51,919 --> 01:11:54,012
OK? Here l come.

1040
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:57,514
There you go.

1041
01:11:57,758 --> 01:11:59,692
He can't do this.

1042
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:05,130
- He still thinks he can talk to animals.
- He can, Lisa. He can talk to animals.

1043
01:12:05,233 --> 01:12:08,464
lt all started when he was a kid.
l didn't know what to do.

1044
01:12:08,536 --> 01:12:11,903
- What are you saying, Dad?
- l thought it was a handicap,

1045
01:12:11,973 --> 01:12:14,066
but it's a gift, Lisa.

1046
01:12:14,141 --> 01:12:17,269
Don't you believe it? Look. See for yourself.

1047
01:12:21,716 --> 01:12:26,517
l need you to stay alert and tell me ifyou feel
numbness in your paws or on your right side.

1048
01:12:26,587 --> 01:12:30,853
Have you ever done this operation before?

1049
01:12:30,925 --> 01:12:33,325
Yeah, once in medical school.

1050
01:12:33,394 --> 01:12:35,658
But it was to a cadaver.

1051
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:39,723
My professor told me that had my patient
not been dead, he would have lived.

1052
01:12:40,167 --> 01:12:42,397
Very comforting, doc.

1053
01:12:49,577 --> 01:12:53,343
lt's like Noah's ark out here.
lt truly is a remarkable sight.

1054
01:12:53,414 --> 01:12:59,148
This collection of animals has prevented San
Francisco's finest from entering the building.

1055
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:02,519
Which is apparently
where the stolen tiger is being held.

1056
01:13:02,690 --> 01:13:02,723
OK, we're open. Gene, irrigate, please.

1057
01:13:02,723 --> 01:13:06,090
OK, we're open. Gene, irrigate, please.

1058
01:13:10,231 --> 01:13:14,429
All right, Jake, l need you to be alert.
Tell me ifyou feel anything at all.

1059
01:13:14,535 --> 01:13:16,628
- Can you feel anything now?
- No.

1060
01:13:16,737 --> 01:13:18,830
Just the same old pain.

1061
01:13:20,174 --> 01:13:24,133
How about now?
You feeling any numbness at all?

1062
01:13:24,211 --> 01:13:27,408
l... l can't. l don't know!

1063
01:13:27,515 --> 01:13:30,382
Just relax and listen to
the sound of my voice, OK?

1064
01:13:30,451 --> 01:13:34,785
- l'm scared.
- Don't be scared. l'm not gonna let you go.

1065
01:13:34,922 --> 01:13:36,981
John?

1066
01:13:38,993 --> 01:13:42,986
- What did he say?
- He said he's a little scared.

1067
01:14:25,473 --> 01:14:28,772
Pulse is dropping fast.

1068
01:14:28,843 --> 01:14:32,973
His dura is bulging.
There's too much pressure.

1069
01:14:33,047 --> 01:14:35,607
- My left side went numb.
- Pulse still dropping.

1070
01:14:35,683 --> 01:14:39,619
All right. Hey, you just hang in there,
OK, Jacob? Hang in there for me.

1071
01:14:39,687 --> 01:14:42,815
- OK, doc.
- lt's a blood clot. lt has to be.

1072
01:14:42,923 --> 01:14:47,383
All l gotta do is find it. We're too close
to his motor strip. More suction, Gene.

1073
01:14:47,461 --> 01:14:50,794
- We're losin' him. We gotta relieve pressure.
- Come on, Jake.

1074
01:14:50,865 --> 01:14:55,325
- Don't let go yet. We're almost there.
- l can feel it.

1075
01:14:55,436 --> 01:14:57,267
- There.
- There?

1076
01:14:57,338 --> 01:14:59,738
OK. OK, here we go.

1077
01:15:05,312 --> 01:15:08,145
lt's gone. The pain is gone.

1078
01:15:08,249 --> 01:15:11,446
Blood pressure stabilising.

1079
01:15:11,519 --> 01:15:14,818
lt's gone. lt's really gone.

1080
01:15:15,122 --> 01:15:17,682
He's OK.

1081
01:15:24,131 --> 01:15:27,726
- Thank you.
- You are very welcome.

1082
01:15:27,835 --> 01:15:32,636
You just lay back and relax. We're gonna
have you back in the centre ring in no time.

1083
01:15:37,845 --> 01:15:39,710
Why'd you do that?

1084
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:43,716
lf he tries to eat me again, l'm gonna
smack that moustache offyour face.

1085
01:15:47,488 --> 01:15:51,185
He's a lunatic.
He has a history of mental illness.

1086
01:15:51,292 --> 01:15:53,385
- He's frankly...
- He's the most

1087
01:15:53,494 --> 01:15:58,397
- remarkable surgeon l have ever seen.
- He's here to stay.

1088
01:15:58,499 --> 01:16:02,799
- He is the straw that stirs the drink.
- l want exclusive rights to him.

1089
01:16:02,903 --> 01:16:05,599
He's dynamic, caring. l can't imagine...

1090
01:16:05,706 --> 01:16:08,504
- What's the matter?
- Dolittle. Wonderful work.

1091
01:16:08,576 --> 01:16:12,672
- Bravo. Bravo, Johnny. l'm so inspired.
- Welcome aboard.

1092
01:16:12,746 --> 01:16:16,739
- l feel like l bought a winning franchise.
- Yeah.

1093
01:16:17,151 --> 01:16:20,416
You haven't bought anything.
We're not for sale.

1094
01:16:20,588 --> 01:16:25,525
Look. We don't need these namby-pamby
wacko freaks. lt's you and me,

1095
01:16:26,093 --> 01:16:30,120
- straight to the top.
- You want pigeon? You'll get pigeon.

1096
01:16:35,836 --> 01:16:40,637
- Are ya happy now?
- l'm right behind ya.

1097
01:16:50,117 --> 01:16:52,415
Hey. Somebody come here.

1098
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:55,114
l think we got birth here.

1099
01:16:55,189 --> 01:16:58,852
Hey, hey! Somebody!
l see some shakin' in that egg.

1100
01:16:58,959 --> 01:17:01,154
l see shakin' in the egg.

1101
01:17:01,228 --> 01:17:03,719
Hey, how's it goin', McGruff?

1102
01:17:03,797 --> 01:17:06,197
You know what? A Tic Tac wouldn't kill you.

1103
01:17:06,267 --> 01:17:09,395
Hey, girl, get up. We got birth comin'.

1104
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:11,597
A swan egg. This is gonna be great.

1105
01:17:11,672 --> 01:17:14,163
- Come on, girl.
- One question. What is a swan?

1106
01:17:14,241 --> 01:17:16,971
- That's my egg hatching.
- OK, just breathe.

1107
01:17:17,077 --> 01:17:20,069
Yeah, here it come, the magic moment.

1108
01:17:20,181 --> 01:17:23,548
Oh, no. Just like Jurassic Park.
lt's gonna kill us.

1109
01:17:23,617 --> 01:17:26,347
My swan egg's hatching. lt's hatching. lt...

1110
01:17:28,556 --> 01:17:31,150
Good lord, doc. What on earth is that?

1111
01:17:31,692 --> 01:17:35,355
That would be Maya's
brand-new baby alligator.

1112
01:17:35,429 --> 01:17:37,294
Cool.

1113
01:17:37,398 --> 01:17:39,832
- Momma?
- Momma? l'm not your momma.

1114
01:17:41,569 --> 01:17:45,164
- Momma?
- Oh, no, don't look at me.

1115
01:17:45,239 --> 01:17:49,801
Although there was that one time
l got drunk in the Everglades...

1116
01:17:51,011 --> 01:17:52,501
Doc, wait up.

1117
01:17:52,613 --> 01:17:55,446
So, you're gonna treat humans andanimals.
l love it.

1118
01:17:55,516 --> 01:17:58,178
lt's no big thing. We're all basically the same.

1119
01:17:58,252 --> 01:18:02,279
My thoughts exactly. First l want to
move my bowl up on the dining-room table.

1120
01:18:02,389 --> 01:18:05,381
Second, no more dog food.
That stuff's just gross.

1121
01:18:05,459 --> 01:18:08,724
l want my own room, with a TV.
Basic cable will be fine.

1122
01:18:09,029 --> 01:18:11,998
l hate stories with happy endings.

1123
01:18:12,099 --> 01:18:13,896
- Yoo-hoo.
- What?

1124
01:18:14,001 --> 01:18:17,129
- l didn't say nothin'.
- Then who...?

1125
01:18:17,238 --> 01:18:21,106
Run for your lives.
Oh, my God. l don't wanna die.

1126
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:24,109
Hang a left. No, hang a right.

1127
01:18:24,211 --> 01:18:30,275
- Legs, do your thing. Outta my way.
- This circle of life really stinks.
