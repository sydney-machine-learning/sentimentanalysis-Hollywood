1
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:06,878
Baba...

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,255
<i>Yes, my son.</i>

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,836
<i>Tell me a story.</i>

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,089
<i>Which one?</i>

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,340
<i>The story of home.</i>

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,091
<i>Millions of years ago...</i>

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,851
<i>a meteorite
made of vibranium...</i>

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,353
<i>the strongest substance
in the universe...</i>

9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,435
<i>struck the continent
of Africa...</i>

10
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,478
<i>affecting the plant life
around it.</i>

11
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,647
<i>And when
the time of man came...</i>

12
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:36,658
<i>five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.</i>

13
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,956
<i>The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...</i>

14
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,287
<i>until a warrior shaman...</i>

15
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,419
<i>received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...</i>

16
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,627
<i>who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...</i>

17
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,042
<i>a plant that granted him</i>

18
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:57,130
<i>superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.</i>

19
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,718
<i>The warrior became king...</i>

20
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,259
<i>and the first Black Panther...</i>

21
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,019
<i>the protector of Wakanda.</i>

22
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,022
<i>Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...</i>

23
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:11,527
<i>but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.</i>

24
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,314
<i>The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...</i>

25
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,735
<i>more advanced
than any other nation.</i>

26
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,573
<i>But as Wakanda thrived...</i>

27
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,160
<i>the world around it descended
further into chaos.</i>

28
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,544
<i>To keep vibranium safe...</i>

29
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,673
<i>the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...</i>

30
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,505
<i>keeping the truth
of their power</i>

31
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,587
<i>from the outside world.</i>

32
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,965
<i>And we still hide,</i> Baba?

33
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,016
<i>Yes.</i>

34
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,893
<i>Why?</i>

35
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,106
- Lucky shot!
- That ain't lucky!

36
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,615
Whatever!
Get outta here!

37
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,744
Check up.

38
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,990
Pick your man up! He open.

39
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,200
Where you at?

40
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,160
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

41
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,496
Pass! Pass!

42
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,784
- Got you, E.
- E, hurry up!

43
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,452
Watch me get this.

44
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,422
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.

45
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,508
Come on.

46
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,593
What you got?

47
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,677
You ain't got nothing.

48
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,714
Hey, look,
if we get in and out quick,

49
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,805
won't be no worries.

50
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,930
You in the van,
come in through from the west.

51
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,261
Come around the corner.

52
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,513
- Land right here.
- Mmm-hmm.

53
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,366
Me and the twins
are pulling up right here.

54
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,642
We're leaving this car behind,
okay? We come this...

55
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,028
Hide the straps.

56
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,362
Yo, is it the Feds?

57
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,365
No.

58
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,297
It's these two
Grace Jones-looking chicks.

59
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,007
They're holding spears.

60
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,602
Open it.

61
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,469
You serious?

62
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,180
They won't knock again.

63
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,032
Who are you?

64
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,247
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.

65
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,463
Prove to me you are one of us.

66
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,263
My King.

67
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,267
Leave us.

68
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,430
This is James. I trust him
with my life. He stays...

69
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,723
with your permission,
King T'Chaka.

70
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,314
As you wish.

71
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,602
At ease.

72
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,165
Come, baby brother.

73
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,174
Let me see
how you are holding up.

74
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,214
You look strong.

75
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,299
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.

76
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,390
How is home?

77
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,683
Not so good.

78
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,644
Baby brother.

79
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,294
There has been an attack.

80
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,814
This man...

81
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:38,896
Ulysses Klaue...

82
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,317
stole a quarter ton of
vibranium from us...

83
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,732
and triggered a bomb
at the border to escape.

84
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,527
Many lives were lost.

85
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,906
He knew where we hid
the vibranium...

86
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,619
and how to strike.

87
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,710
He had someone on the inside.

88
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,875
Why are you here?

89
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,340
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes...

90
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,424
and tell me
why you betrayed Wakanda.

91
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,214
I did no such thing.

92
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,176
Tell him who you are.

93
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,686
Zuri, son of Badu...

94
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,856
What?

95
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,067
James. James, you lied to me?

96
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,157
Leave him.

97
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,302
You were Wakandan
this whole time?

98
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,326
You betrayed Wakanda!

99
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,471
How could you lie
to me like...

100
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,452
Stand down.

101
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,326
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?

102
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,556
Prince N'Jobu...

103
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,342
you will return home
at once...

104
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,386
where you will face
the Council...

105
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,226
and inform them
of your crimes.

106
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,684
Check up!

107
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,404
Guard your man,
guard your man!

108
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,701
Yo.

109
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,667
<i>The tiny nation of Wakanda</i>

110
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,621
<i>is mourning the death
of its monarch, King T'Chaka.</i>

111
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,290
<i>The beloved ruler was one of
many confirmed dead...</i>

112
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,549
<i>after a terrorist attack</i>

113
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,297
<i>at the United Nations
a week ago.</i>

114
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,634
<i>The suspect
has since been apprehended.</i>

115
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:13,759
<i>Though it remains one of</i>

116
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,119
<i>the poorest countries
in the world...</i>

117
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,884
<i>fortified by
mountain ranges...</i>

118
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,678
<i>and an impenetrable
rainforest...</i>

119
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,937
<i>Wakanda does not engage</i>

120
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,686
<i>in international trade
or accept aid.</i>

121
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,100
<i>The succession
of the throne...</i>

122
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,547
<i>is expected to fall
to the oldest</i>

123
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,857
<i>of the king's two children...</i>

124
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,362
<i>Prince T'Challa.</i>

125
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,232
My Prince...

126
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,321
coming up on them now.

127
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,760
No need, Okoye.
I can handle this alone.

128
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,022
Hmm.

129
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,936
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.

130
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,196
Just don't freeze
when you see her.

131
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,906
What are you talking about?

132
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,697
I never freeze.

133
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,826
What's going on?

134
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,388
It's the car.
It lost power. It won't start.

135
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,678
The car no start.

136
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,146
What happened?

137
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,521
The engine failed.

138
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,183
Ours, too.

139
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,482
What is it, Captain?

140
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,417
Defense positions.

141
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,868
Defense positions.

142
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,378
Are we under attack?

143
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,959
Defense positions.

144
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,257
Get around to the side.

145
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,301
Defense positions.

146
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,632
Hey. Defense positions!

147
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,681
No games.

148
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,204
What do you see?

149
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,759
Come in. Come in.

150
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,257
Over there! Look back!

151
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,099
Watch out!

152
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,324
T'Challa, no!

153
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,744
This one's just a boy.

154
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,255
He got kidnapped as well.

155
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,341
Nakia...

156
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,924
I...

157
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,639
- I wanted...
- Hey!

158
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,472
I have her!
Don't move! I will shoot!

159
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,391
I will shoot her right now.

160
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,149
You froze.

161
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,147
Ah...

162
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,991
Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.

163
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,369
My father is dead, Nakia.

164
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,540
I will be crowned king
tomorrow.

165
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,584
And I wish for you
to be there.

166
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,381
Carry yourselves home now.

167
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,475
Thank you.

168
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,120
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.

169
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,514
Thank you oh.

170
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,395
You will speak
nothing of this day.

171
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:39,907
Yes.

172
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,783
Thank you.

173
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,827
Thank you.

174
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,566
Sister Nakia...

175
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,531
My Prince...

176
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,941
we are home.

177
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,855
This never gets old.

178
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,046
Queen Mother...

179
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,958
Princess...

180
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,048
My comfort for your loss.

181
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,257
Thank you, Nakia.

182
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,044
It is so good
to have you back with us.

183
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,366
Take her to
the River Province

184
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,630
to prepare her
for the ceremony.

185
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,928
Yes, General.

186
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,225
Did he freeze?

187
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,694
Like an antelope
in headlights.

188
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,321
Are you finished?

189
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,279
So surprised
my little sister came

190
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,285
to see me off
before our big day.

191
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,459
You wish!

192
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,285
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.

193
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,625
Update? No.
It worked perfectly.

194
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,279
How many times
do I have to teach you?

195
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,631
Just because something works

196
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,425
doesn't mean
that it cannot be improved.

197
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,757
You are teaching me?
What do you know?

198
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,054
More than you.

199
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,721
I can't wait to see what kind
of update you make...

200
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,806
to your ceremonial outfit.

201
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,396
Shuri!

202
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,182
Sorry, Mother!

203
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,026
How are you
feeling today, Mama?

204
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,566
Proud.

205
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,325
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.

206
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,862
He is with us...

207
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,077
and it is your time
to be king.

208
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,892
Good morning.

209
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,561
How can I help you?

210
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,597
I was just checking out
these artifacts.

211
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:43,892
They tell me
you're the expert.

212
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,230
Ah. You could say that.

213
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,066
They're beautiful.

214
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,690
Where's this one from?

215
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,325
The Bobo Ashanti tribe...

216
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,735
present day Ghana...

217
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:56,994
19th century.

218
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,165
For real?

219
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,158
What about this one?

220
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,961
That one's from the Edo people
of Benin...

221
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,997
16th century.

222
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,090
Now, tell me about this one.

223
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,052
Also from Benin,
seventh century.

224
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,225
Fula tribe, I believe.

225
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,769
Nah.

226
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,596
I beg your pardon?

227
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,640
It was taken by
British soldiers in Benin

228
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,896
But it's from Wakanda.

229
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,559
And it's made
out of vibranium.

230
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,355
Don't trip.

231
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,906
I'mma take it
off your hands for you.

232
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,285
These items aren't for sale.

233
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,034
How do you think
your ancestors got these?

234
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,698
You think they paid
a fair price?

235
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,038
Or did they take it, like they
took everything else?

236
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,127
Sir, I'm going to have to

237
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,670
ask you to leave.

238
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,296
You got
all this security in here

239
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,873
watching me
ever since I walked in.

240
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,488
But you ain't checking for

241
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,549
what you put in your body.

242
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,879
All right, mate.
Let's have it.

243
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,509
Come on, mate. Time.

244
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,323
I think she might not
be feeling too good.

245
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,684
Somebody get some help!
Come here!

246
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,562
Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!

247
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,834
Medical emergency
right away

248
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,377
in the West African Exhibit,
please, right away.

249
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,401
Look out.

250
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,103
Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.

251
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,988
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.

252
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,491
I'm gonna take a break.

253
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:22,017
Let's give the lady
some space, please.

254
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,143
Step back,
please, gents.

255
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,453
Step back, please.

256
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,213
Hey, come here.

257
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,250
Come here. It's okay.

258
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,137
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?

259
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,873
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?

260
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,958
Because it's better to leave

261
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,222
the crime scene
more spread out.

262
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,899
Makes us look like amateurs.

263
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,868
Now then,
let's see if you know

264
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,544
what you're talking about.

265
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,428
That's just a taste.

266
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,147
- You're gonna be a rich boy.
- You better sell that quick.

267
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,941
It's already sold!

268
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:40,744
Whatever you try,

269
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,930
the Wakandans'll
probably show up.

270
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,410
That'll make my day.

271
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,897
I can kill two birds
with one stone.

272
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,250
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?

273
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,206
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

274
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,873
Onward!

275
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,330
Onward!

276
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,871
I, Zuri...

277
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,170
son of Badu...

278
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,081
give to you...

279
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,420
Prince T'Challa...

280
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,301
the Black Panther!

281
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,803
The prince...

282
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:14,596
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther...

283
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,015
stripped away.

284
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,844
Praise the ancestors.

285
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,307
Praise the ancestors.

286
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,479
Victory in ritual combat...

287
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:00,187
comes by yield or death.

288
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,899
If any tribe wishes to
put forth a warrior...

289
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,905
I now offer...

290
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,533
a path to the throne.

291
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,951
The Merchant Tribe
will not challenge today.

292
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:24,041
The Border Tribe
will not challenge today.

293
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,754
The River Tribe
will not challenge today.

294
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,725
The Mining Tribe
will not challenge today.

295
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,808
Is there any member
of a royal blood...

296
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,892
who wishes to challenge
for the throne?

297
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,489
This corset
is really uncomfortable...

298
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,902
so could we all just
wrap it up and go home?

299
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,573
Mother!

300
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,476
- Are they Jabari?
- Yes.

301
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,192
M'Baku, what are you
doing here?

302
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,320
It's challenge day.

303
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,161
We have watched...

304
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,293
and listened
from the mountains!

305
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,424
We have watched
with disgust...

306
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,382
as your
technological advancements

307
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,554
have been overseen by a child!

308
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,598
Who scoffs at tradition!

309
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,264
And now you want to
hand the nation

310
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,270
over to this prince...

311
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:11,406
who could not keep
his own father safe.

312
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,988
Mmm?

313
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,079
We will not have it.

314
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:22,333
I said,
we will not have it, oh!

315
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,995
I, M'Baku...

316
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,251
leader of the Jabari...

317
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:32,714
I accept your challenge,
M'Baku.

318
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,925
Glory to Hanuman.

319
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,200
Jabari!

320
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:57,912
Dora Milaje!

321
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,414
Onward!

322
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,247
Let the challenge begin!

323
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,847
Oh!

324
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,648
Stand up!

325
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,615
Come!

326
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,208
T'Challa!

327
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,882
Where is your god now?

328
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,810
Yes!

329
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,440
No powers.

330
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,238
No claws.

331
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,195
No special suit, oh!

332
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,407
Just a boy not fit to lead!

333
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,573
Show him who you are!

334
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,849
I am Prince T'Challa...

335
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,601
son of King T'Chaka!

336
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,387
You can do this, T'Challa!

337
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,203
Yes!

338
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,746
Come on!

339
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,076
Yield! Don't make me kill you.

340
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,832
I would rather die!

341
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,255
T'Challa!

342
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,465
T'Challa!

343
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,217
T'Challa!

344
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,219
T'Challa!

345
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,054
T'Challa!

346
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,254
You have fought with honor!

347
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,014
Now yield!
Your people need you.

348
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,184
T'Challa!

349
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,602
T'Challa!

350
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:27,848
Yield, man!

351
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,261
T'Challa!

352
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,690
T'Challa!

353
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,018
Yes! Yes!

354
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,175
I now present to you...

355
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,676
King T'Challa...

356
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,257
the Black Panther.

357
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,389
Zuri.

358
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,524
My King.

359
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,821
Wakanda forever!

360
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,080
Wakanda forever!

361
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,027
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

362
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:07,364
to restore the powers
of the Black Panther...

363
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,405
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

364
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:15,997
T'Chaka...

365
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,163
we call on you.

366
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,208
Come here to your son.

367
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,184
Praise the ancestors.

368
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,198
Father.

369
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,735
My son.

370
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,582
I'm sorry.

371
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,539
Stand up.

372
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,920
You are a king.

373
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,846
What is wrong my son?

374
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,606
I am not ready.

375
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,776
Have you not prepared

376
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:51,157
to be king your whole life?

377
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,864
Have you not trained
and studied,

378
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,867
been by my side?

379
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,284
That is not
what I am talking about.

380
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,421
I am not ready
to be without you.

381
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,587
A man who has not prepared
his children

382
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,218
for his own death...

383
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,554
has failed as a father.

384
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,264
Have I ever failed you?

385
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,312
Never.

386
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,563
Tell me how to
best protect Wakanda.

387
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,280
I want to be
a great king, <i>Baba.</i>

388
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,241
Just like you.

389
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,826
You're going to struggle.

390
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,833
So you'll need to
surround yourself

391
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,626
with people you trust.

392
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,039
You're a good man
with a good heart.

393
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,546
And it's hard
for a good man to be king.

394
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,343
Breathe.

395
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,054
T'Challa, breathe.

396
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,228
Breathe.

397
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,773
He was there.

398
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:10,527
He was there. My father.

399
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,379
Just one?

400
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,053
Come home, Nakia.

401
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,463
I'm right here.

402
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,097
Stay.

403
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:43,261
I came to support you
and to honor your father...

404
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,803
but I can't stay.

405
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,807
I found my calling out there.

406
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,436
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.

407
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,445
I can't be happy here...

408
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,324
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.

409
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,370
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?

410
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,664
Share what we have.

411
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,323
We could provide aid...

412
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,502
and access to technology

413
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,826
and refuge
to those who need it.

414
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,412
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.

415
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:15,005
We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.

416
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,241
If the world found out
what we truly are...

417
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,755
what we possess...

418
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,594
we could lose our way of life.

419
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,055
Wakanda is strong enough
to help others

420
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,977
and protect ourselves
at the same time.

421
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,687
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.

422
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,318
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.

423
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,981
- Ah! See, you admit it!
- If that's what I wanted.

424
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,743
Is that him?

425
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,999
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?

426
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,507
Of course.

427
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,333
I see Nakia is back.

428
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,046
You guys going to work it out?

429
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,468
T'Challa...

430
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,724
what's wrong?

431
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,480
Nakia thinks
we should be doing more.

432
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,650
More, like what?

433
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,059
Foreign aid, refugee programs.

434
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,069
You let the refugees in...

435
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,697
they bring their problems
with them.

436
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,154
And then Wakanda
is like everywhere else.

437
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,863
Now if you said
you wanted me and my men...

438
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,540
to go out there
and clean up the world,

439
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,243
then I'll be all for it.

440
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,627
But waging war
on other countries

441
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,296
has never been our way.

442
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,054
You, too, huh?

443
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,882
Bast! We're in trouble.

444
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,008
<i>My King.</i>

445
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:47,936
<i>My love.</i>

446
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:51,563
<i>You will never guess who just
popped up on our radar.</i>

447
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,148
A misidentified
Wakandan artifact...

448
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,984
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.

449
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,276
We have learned
Ulysses Klaue...

450
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,287
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...

451
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,788
in South Korea...

452
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,369
tomorrow night.

453
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:15,955
Klaue has escaped our pursuits
for almost 30 years.

454
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:20,384
Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.

455
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,636
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.

456
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:28,426
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.

457
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:29,853
We need a king.

458
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,683
My parents were killed
when he attacked.

459
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,565
Not a day goes by
when I do not think

460
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,734
about what Klaue took from us.

461
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,364
From me.

462
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,445
It's too great
an opportunity to pass.

463
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,733
Take me with you.

464
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,819
We'll take him down together,
side by side.

465
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,034
I need you here
protecting the border.

466
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,448
Then I ask...

467
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,742
you kill him
where he stands...

468
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,002
or you bring him back to us.

469
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,292
You have my word.

470
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,167
I will bring him back.

471
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,675
We will proceed
with the mission.

472
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:52,728
My King!

473
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,637
Stop it. Stop it.

474
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,812
I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.

475
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,311
Who are you taking with you
to Korea?

476
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,820
Okoye.

477
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,398
And Nakia as well.

478
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,029
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?

479
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:13,580
Yes.

480
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:15,786
We'll be fine.

481
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,797
Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.

482
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,123
Yes!

483
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,664
I have great things
to show you, Brother.

484
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,208
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.

485
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,714
Unlimited range,

486
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,547
also equipped with
audio surveillance system.

487
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,055
Check these out.

488
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,385
Remote access Kimoyo Beads.

489
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,351
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.

490
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,057
Ah.

491
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,191
And what are these?

492
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:45,275
The real question is
what are those?

493
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:48,009
Why do you have
your toes out in my lab?

494
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,067
What, you don't like
my royal sandals?

495
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,033
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.

496
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,117
I bet the Elders loved that.

497
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,376
Try them on.

498
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,499
Fully automated.

499
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,165
Like the old American movie
<i>Baba</i> used to watch.

500
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,260
Mmm.

501
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,506
And I made them
completely sound absorbent.

502
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:11,682
Interesting.

503
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,591
Guess what I call them.

504
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,133
Sneakers.

505
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,095
Because you...

506
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,434
Never mind.

507
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,344
If you're going to take
on Klaue...

508
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:26,649
you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.

509
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:27,938
Exhibit A.

510
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,652
- My design.
- Old tech.

511
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,067
- Old?
- Functional, but old.

512
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,906
"Hey, people are shooting
at me.

513
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,954
"Wait, let me put on
my helmet."

514
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,706
Enough.

515
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,750
Now, look at these.

516
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,712
Do you like that one?

517
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,169
Tempting.

518
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,383
But the idea
is to not be noticed.

519
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,222
This one.

520
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,933
Now tell it to go on.

521
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,485
Ooh!

522
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,694
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.

523
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,988
Strike it.

524
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,161
- Anywhere?
- Mmm-hmm.

525
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,287
Not that hard, genius!

526
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,668
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.

527
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,124
I invite you to my lab,

528
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,670
and you just
kick things around?

529
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,549
Well, maybe you should make it
a little stronger.

530
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,671
Hey.

531
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,298
Wait a minute.

532
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:35,180
The nanites
absorb the kinetic energy...

533
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,762
and hold it in place
for redistribution.

534
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,267
Very nice.

535
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,099
Strike it again
in the same spot.

536
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,266
You're recording?

537
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,602
For research purposes.

538
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,243
Delete that footage.

539
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:18,845
This way.

540
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,470
Bast willing,
this will go quickly...

541
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,640
and I can get this ridiculous
thing off my head.

542
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:30,027
It looks nice.
Just whip it back and forth.

543
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,858
What? It's a disgrace.

544
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,487
Hello Sophia.

545
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,993
Good to see you.

546
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,871
Who are these two?

547
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,078
My friends from Kenya.

548
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,626
Very deep pockets.
They're good.

549
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,504
Good for trouble...

550
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,256
...like you?

551
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,557
Thank you!

552
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,695
Spread out.

553
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:28,202
The buyer
is likely already here.

554
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,805
The woman outside.

555
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,936
What trouble
was she referring to?

556
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,815
Ah... I got into
a disagreement

557
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,737
with some ivory traders.

558
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,944
- Made a bit of a mess.
- Hmm.

559
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:00,196
And will there be
any trouble tonight,

560
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,197
Ms. Kenyan Heiress?

561
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,532
Depends...

562
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,913
on how quickly we finish
the mission.

563
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,916
<i>Can we please focus?</i>

564
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,956
Thank you.

565
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,590
Over here.

566
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,132
One whiskey, please.

567
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,559
Eyes up. Americans.

568
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,355
I count three.

569
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,729
Five.

570
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:39,301
How could you miss
Greased Lightning

571
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,565
there behind you?

572
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,858
Six.

573
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:45,449
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.

574
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,206
It just got
a little more complicated.

575
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:52,619
Agent Ross.

576
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:53,912
Your Highness.

577
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,005
You are buying from Klaue.

578
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,710
What I'm doing or not doing...

579
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,298
on behalf of
the U.S. government

580
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,595
is none of your concern.

581
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,426
Now, whatever the hell
you're up to...

582
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,682
do me a favor,
stay out of my way.

583
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,139
I gave you Zemo.

584
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,677
Didn't I keep it
under wraps...

585
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,472
that the king of
a third world country

586
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,523
runs around
in a bulletproof cat suit?

587
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,058
I'd say we were even.

588
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,818
You really need to leave, now.

589
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,780
Klaue is leaving
out that door with me.

590
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,484
You've been warned.

591
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,448
Three, craps.

592
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,321
Hey, you won!

593
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,162
You know what?

594
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,326
I think
I'll just take these...

595
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,211
bring them over here

596
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,630
- and hold on for safekeeping.
- Mmm-hmm.

597
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,344
Okay, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.

598
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,221
He cannot leave with Klaue.

599
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,767
All right.

600
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,335
Vibranium from the attack
on Sokovia

601
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,395
links back to a person...

602
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:51,683
that I'm not actually saying

603
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:52,916
I'm here to make
a deal with...

604
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,307
but that deal
will not be called off.

605
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,724
When the dust settles,

606
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,355
you and me can work
something out.

607
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,395
I'm not here to make a deal.

608
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,303
Klaue, plus eight!

609
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:30,644
General.

610
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,677
In position
to secure our exit.

611
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:33,855
And the vibranium?

612
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,642
I don't see it yet.

613
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,399
<i>I thought there were
no weapons allowed in here.</i>

614
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,310
There's not supposed to be.

615
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,855
Somebody did not get the memo.

616
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,365
Definitely armed.

617
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,068
Well, that is quite
the entourage.

618
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,407
You got a mixtape coming out?

619
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,197
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, actually, there is one.

620
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,241
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.

621
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,854
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the tape?

622
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,558
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.

623
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,430
I just meant you got a lot of
people with you.

624
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,957
You think they're for you?

625
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,255
Don't worry.

626
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,294
I can do a deal with you
all by myself,

627
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:07,550
thank you very much.

628
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,473
<i>Six more. It's a setup.</i>

629
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,728
You got the diamonds?

630
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,185
Okay. That's enough.

631
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,689
- We need to move on Klaue.
<i>- Stand down.</i>

632
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,779
We can't afford a shootout.

633
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:29,953
Vibranium?

634
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,371
I was going to buy
a fancy suitcase...

635
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:44,041
but I thought
I'd save myself some money.

636
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,126
It's now or never.

637
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,419
Stand down!

638
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:49,014
Hey!

639
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,415
Wakandans! They're here!

640
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,130
- Get outta here!
- Kill 'em all!

641
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,317
Diamonds, quick!

642
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:09,094
Murderer!

643
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,975
You know, you look just like
your old man.

644
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,855
I made it rain!

645
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,656
Let's get out of here, boss!

646
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:38,363
That was awesome!
That was awesome!

647
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:41,078
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!

648
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:45,420
- Do we just leave him?
- He'll catch up.

649
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:54,796
Shuri!

650
00:48:58,394 --> 00:48:59,394
Yes!

651
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,974
<i>Remote
driving system activated.</i>

652
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,522
Wait! Which side of
the road is it?

653
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,723
<i>For Bast's sake!</i>

654
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,232
<i>- Just drive!</i>
- Okay, calm down!

655
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,201
Whoo! Let's go!

656
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,578
Put some music on. What do you
think this is, a funeral?

657
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,666
Which one is he in now?

658
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,295
Hey, split Up!

659
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:32,092
- They're trying to lose us.
- I'll take the right.

660
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,463
We'll take the other two!
I see a shortcut.

661
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,771
We're not going to make it!

662
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:56,532
Keep going!

663
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,616
Whoo! Brother!

664
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,592
Hey, what was that?

665
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,963
Don't worry
about it. You're doing great.

666
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,308
Guns.

667
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:32,852
So primitive!

668
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,862
It's a vibranium car,
you idiots!

669
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,110
The bullets won't penetrate!

670
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:39,362
What are you doing?

671
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,743
Just drive.

672
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,799
- Whoo!
- Shit!

673
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,813
Hey, look at your suit.

674
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,103
You've been taking bullets,

675
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,063
charging it up
with kinetic energy.

676
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,391
Pull around the truck.

677
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,205
Where'd he go?

678
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:36,924
You show-off.

679
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,178
There he is!

680
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,599
Hold tight!

681
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,720
All right.
Let's have some fun!

682
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:16,924
Hop in.

683
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:19,793
Put that spear in the trunk.

684
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,177
Faster, Shuri.

685
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,926
I'm going as fast as I can!

686
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:30,811
Take a right! Take a right!

687
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,608
No, no, no!

688
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,066
Brother!

689
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,590
Klaue!

690
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,349
Did you think we would forget?

691
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,360
Look at me, murderer!

692
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:21,771
Where did you get this weapon?

693
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,615
You savages didn't deserve it.

694
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,746
Oh, mercy, King. Mercy.

695
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,032
Every breath you take
is mercy from me.

696
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,450
King!

697
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:36,953
The world watches.

698
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,042
Come on. Guys.
Let's go, huh?

699
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:45,805
Yeah.

700
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:01,769
Hello.

701
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,446
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.

702
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,376
So this is a big mess, huh?

703
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:19,753
I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.

704
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,643
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in.

705
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:25,176
We can't let him
talk to Klaue alone.

706
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:31,215
Better to let him talk to
Klaue alone for 5 minutes

707
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,223
than to make a scene here.

708
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,728
After your questioning,

709
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,726
we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.

710
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:41,438
What? No.
Look, I like you, a lot.

711
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:44,400
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.

712
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,234
Listen, I'm doing you guys
a favor

713
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:47,907
by letting you
even be in here.

714
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,736
If he touches you again,

715
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,664
I'm going to impale him
to this desk.

716
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:57,916
Does she speak English?

717
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,002
When she wants to.

718
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:01,874
Huh.

719
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,000
I'm going in.

720
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,253
When I'm done,
you guys are up.

721
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,168
- Agent Ross.
- Yeah?

722
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,634
I do appreciate your help
in Busan.

723
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,389
You see that?

724
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,137
It's called diplomacy.

725
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,270
You're welcome.

726
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:20,606
Okoye.

727
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:21,773
Play nice.

728
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,025
Americans.

729
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:37,082
You know, you really shouldn't
trust the Wakandans.

730
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,453
I'm much more your speed.

731
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:40,459
I don't trust anybody,
not in this job.

732
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:43,121
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.

733
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,459
Where'd you get that?

734
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,486
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.

735
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,877
But I can get you one,
if you like.

736
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,934
Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier,

737
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,008
and I'll ask them.

738
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,638
He's right outside.

739
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,391
Why don't you
ask him yourself?

740
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,051
What? T'Challa?

741
00:55:57,229 --> 00:56:00,563
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?

742
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:01,732
Bingo.

743
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:06,064
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?

744
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:07,478
Um...

745
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,739
Shepherds, textiles,
cool outfits.

746
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,389
<i>It's all a front.</i>

747
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:15,411
<i>Explorers searched for it
for centuries.</i>

748
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,039
<i>El Dorado, the Golden City.</i>

749
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,540
<i>They thought they could
find it in South America...</i>

750
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:23,578
but it was in Africa
the whole time.

751
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,541
A technological marvel.

752
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,128
All because it was built
on a mound

753
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,255
of the most valuable metal
known to man.

754
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,512
<i>Isipho,</i> they call it.
The gift.

755
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,214
Vibranium.

756
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,554
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.

757
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:38,934
It's not just a metal.

758
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,641
They sew it
into their clothes.

759
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,603
It powers their city,
their tech...

760
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,016
their weapons.

761
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:47,776
Weapons?

762
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:48,946
Yeah.

763
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,443
Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.

764
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:52,903
That's a nice fairy tale,

765
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,904
but Wakanda is
a third world country...

766
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,536
and you stole
all their vibranium.

767
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:58,992
I stole...

768
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,617
All of it?

769
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,505
I took a tiny piece of it.

770
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,381
They have
a mountain full of it.

771
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,758
<i>They've been mining it
for thousands of years...</i>

772
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,170
<i>and they still haven't
scratched the surface.</i>

773
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,305
<i>I'm the only outsider
who's seen it</i>

774
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,973
<i>and got out of there alive.</i>

775
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,804
<i>If you don't believe me,</i>

776
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:23,138
<i>you ask your friend
what his suit is made of.</i>

777
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:26,065
What his claws are made of.

778
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,756
Your father told the UN...

779
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,839
that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.

780
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,548
But now he's telling me
you have more.

781
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,133
And you believe the word

782
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,716
of an arms dealer
strapped to a chair?

783
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:19,610
Where is that?

784
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,371
Back there.

785
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,508
How much more are you hiding?

786
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,837
Something is happening
out back.

787
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,098
Get down!

788
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,021
Stand down!

789
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:56,574
Cover!

790
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,700
Grenade!

791
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,571
I see you took your time,
didn't you?

792
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,554
My King!

793
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:29,017
My King.

794
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,306
Nakia.

795
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,856
He just jumped in front of me.

796
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,360
I don't think
he'll make it here.

797
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:40,816
It hit his spine.

798
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:45,162
Give me a Kimoyo Bead.

799
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,414
This will stabilize him
for now.

800
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:00,961
Give him to us.

801
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,380
We can save him.

802
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,809
Our mission
was to bring back Klaue.

803
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,277
We failed.

804
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,655
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.

805
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:23,363
How do we justify
bringing him into our borders?

806
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:24,777
He took a bullet for me.

807
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,662
That was his choice.

808
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,365
So now we are just supposed to
let him die?

809
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,375
Let us consider
that we heal him.

810
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,791
It is his duty to report back
to his country.

811
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,623
And as king, it is your duty
to protect ours.

812
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:40,213
I'm well aware of
my duties, General.

813
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:44,009
I cannot just let him die...

814
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,217
knowing we can save him.

815
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,806
Where exactly
are we taking him?

816
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:00,233
Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.

817
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,364
This is going to be fun.

818
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,697
He will live.

819
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,332
W'Kabi is here.

820
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,972
What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?

821
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,008
He's not here.

822
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,102
He slipped through our hands.

823
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,900
"Slipped"?

824
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:44,653
For 30 years, your father was
in power and did nothing.

825
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:47,033
With you,
I thought it'd be different.

826
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,911
But it's more of the same.

827
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,433
Let's get going, boss.

828
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,811
You always sell to the CIA?

829
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,892
I sell to the highest bidder.

830
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,183
But don't you worry.
When I get back to Joburg...

831
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:20,647
and I lay low for a bit,

832
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,217
I'll make sure
both you guys get paid.

833
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,091
Oh, I ain't worried
about the money, bro.

834
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,115
I know you good for it.

835
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,866
On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.

836
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,013
You don't want to
go there, boy.

837
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:30,037
Yeah, I do.

838
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:33,999
Drop it!

839
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,621
Or your little
Bonnie and Clyde routine

840
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:37,997
ends today.

841
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,536
Put your gun down now!

842
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,296
I'm sorry.

843
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,707
- Sorry, Erik.
- It's gonna be okay.

844
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,617
You really want to go
to Wakanda?

845
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,123
They're savages.

846
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:21,207
This is what they do
to people like us.

847
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:22,692
I ain't worried
about no brand.

848
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:24,172
Check these out.

849
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,875
Each one is for a kill.

850
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,053
You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.

851
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,011
To them,
you'll just be an outsider.

852
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,471
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.

853
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:45,318
Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.

854
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:00,913
Leave us!

855
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:15,341
So your mission did not go
as planned.

856
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:20,100
What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?

857
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,603
My father told me
he disappeared.

858
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,143
There was a man today...

859
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:31,031
wearing a ring
identical to this one.

860
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,568
That is not possible.

861
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:38,448
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!

862
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,866
My grandfather's ring!

863
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,580
Do not tell me
what is possible.

864
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,705
Tell me the truth!

865
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,000
Some truths...

866
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:56,465
are too much to bear,
T'Challa.

867
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,969
That is not your choice
to make.

868
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:01,855
What happened to him?

869
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,476
I promised the king
to say nothing.

870
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,482
I am your king now!

871
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,412
Your uncle took...

872
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:28,585
a War Dog assignment
in America.

873
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:32,592
Your father...

874
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,095
placed me there...

875
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:36,974
<i>to observe...</i>

876
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,642
unbeknownst to him.

877
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:43,725
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.

878
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,521
They had a child.

879
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,275
The hardships he saw there...

880
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,737
radicalized your uncle.

881
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:55,114
I observed
for as long as I could.

882
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,943
Their leaders
have been assassinated.

883
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,533
Communities flooded with drugs
and weapons.

884
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:03,074
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.

885
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,284
All over the planet...

886
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:06,748
our people suffer because

887
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:08,829
they don't have the tools
to fight back.

888
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:11,127
With vibranium weapons,

889
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,799
they could overthrow
every country...

890
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,755
and Wakanda could
rule them all

891
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:16,132
the right way.

892
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:19,844
He knew your father
would not support this.

893
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:23,810
So, your uncle betrayed us.

894
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,186
No!

895
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:28,599
<i>He helped Klaue
steal the vibranium.</i>

896
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,564
No, no, no.

897
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,320
You will return home
at once...

898
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,322
where you will face
the Council...

899
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:38,450
and inform them
of your crimes.

900
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,327
<i>He drew his weapon
on me.</i>

901
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:42,738
No!

902
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:01,590
<i>Your father
killed his own brother...</i>

903
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:05,636
to save my life.

904
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:12,644
Speak nothing of this.

905
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,315
And the Child?

906
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,699
We left him.

907
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:33,292
We had to...

908
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:35,586
maintain...

909
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:38,339
the lie.

910
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,241
What is this?

911
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,280
Just a little gift.

912
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,310
Who are you?

913
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,189
All right, where am I?

914
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,984
Don't scare me like that,
colonizer!

915
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,320
What?
My name is Everett.

916
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:31,615
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...

917
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:34,581
former air force pilot
and now CIA.

918
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,123
Right.

919
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,254
Okay, is this Wakanda?

920
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,044
No, it's Kansas.

921
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,886
How long ago was Korea?

922
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,175
Yesterday.

923
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,353
I don't think so.

924
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,724
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.

925
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:56,022
They do here.

926
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:59,435
But not by magic,
by technology.

927
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:07,071
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.

928
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,268
These train things...

929
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:35,679
that's magnetic levitation,
right?

930
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:36,892
Obviously.

931
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:41,310
Obviously, but I've never
seen it this efficient.

932
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,146
The light panels,
what are they?

933
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,740
<i>- Sonic stabilizers.
- Sonic what?</i>

934
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:49,405
In its raw form...

935
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,195
vibranium is too dangerous

936
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:53,030
to be transported
at that speed...

937
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:56,290
so I developed a way
to temporarily deactivate it.

938
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,980
<i>There's vibranium
on those trains?</i>

939
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,295
There's vibranium
all around us.

940
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,632
That's how I healed you.

941
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,180
<i>Where is T'Challa?</i>

942
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,344
<i>His Kimoyo Beads
have been switched off.</i>

943
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,763
Well, we are not
joined at the hip, Okoye.

944
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,227
<i>A man showed up at the border</i>

945
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:21,604
<i>who claims
to have killed Klaue.</i>

946
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:22,778
What?

947
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:25,399
<i>W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.</i>

948
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:27,405
<i>We need to find your brother!</i>

949
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:28,575
An outsider?

950
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:30,359
<i>No, a Wakandan.</i>

951
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,947
He's not a Wakandan.

952
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:35,788
He's one of ours.

953
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,842
He killed his own brother...

954
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,177
and left a child behind...

955
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:54,591
with nothing.

956
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,178
What kind of king...

957
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:02,269
What kind of man does that?

958
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,650
No man is perfect.

959
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:06,861
Not even your father.

960
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:09,739
He didn't even give him
a proper burial.

961
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:14,702
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...

962
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,160
he may have created something
even worse.

963
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,584
Hey.

964
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,581
Look at me.

965
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:29,710
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.

966
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:35,966
You get to decide what kind of
king you are going to be.

967
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:44,649
<i>Brother, you need to
get here now!</i>

968
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,355
Erik Stevens.

969
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,028
Graduated Annapolis age 19...

970
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,109
MIT for grad school.

971
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:53,446
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan...

972
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,030
where he wrapped up
confirmed kills,

973
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:56,202
like it was a video game.

974
01:12:56,664 --> 01:12:58,405
Started calling him
Killmonger.

975
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:01,245
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.

976
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:02,830
They will drop off the grid...

977
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,284
so they can
commit assassinations

978
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:05,453
and take down governments.

979
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:09,667
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?

980
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,501
He has
a War Dog tattoo...

981
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:14,762
but we have no record of him.

982
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,312
Is this man Wakandan or not?

983
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,353
Tell us what is going on.

984
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:46,831
Speak.

985
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,256
Speak.

986
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:52,458
I'm standing in your house...

987
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,002
serving justice to a man

988
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,383
who stole your vibranium
and murdered your people.

989
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:58,584
Justice your king
couldn't deliver.

990
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:06,606
I don't care
that you brought Klaue.

991
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,108
Only reason I don't kill you
where you stand

992
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,232
is because I know who you are.

993
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:14,192
Now, what do you want?

994
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:17,450
I want the throne.

995
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,161
My goodness.

996
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,957
Y'all sittin' up here
comfortable.

997
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,076
Must feel good.

998
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,287
It's about two billion people

999
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:30,998
all over the world
that looks like us.

1000
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,549
But their lives
are a lot harder.

1001
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,006
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.

1002
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,387
And what tools are those?

1003
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,637
Vibranium. Your weapons.

1004
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:45,429
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.

1005
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:49,349
It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner...

1006
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:51,359
for people
who are not our own.

1007
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:53,402
Not your own?

1008
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:56,030
But didn't life start
right here on this continent?

1009
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,611
So ain't all people
your people?

1010
01:14:57,785 --> 01:15:01,403
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.

1011
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,155
And it is my responsibility

1012
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,116
to make sure
our people are safe...

1013
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:08,500
and that vibranium
does not fall

1014
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,373
into the hands
of a person like you.

1015
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:11,788
- Mmm...
- Son.

1016
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:14,423
We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.

1017
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,342
Reject his request.

1018
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,004
Oh, I ain't
requesting nothing.

1019
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,843
- Ask who I am.
- You're Erik Stevens.

1020
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:24,675
An American black operative.

1021
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,561
A mercenary
nicknamed Killmonger.

1022
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:27,647
That's who you are.

1023
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:29,351
That's not my name, Princess.

1024
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,099
Ask me, King.

1025
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:32,438
No.

1026
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:34,686
Ask me.

1027
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,444
Take him away.

1028
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:40,910
Who are you?

1029
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,364
I am N'Jadaka,
son of Prince N'Jobu.

1030
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,535
Son of N'Jobu?

1031
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:48,729
I found my daddy

1032
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:49,855
with Panther claws
in his chest!

1033
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:51,961
You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.

1034
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,246
You're lying!

1035
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:55,464
- Lies!
- I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.

1036
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:58,964
What?

1037
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:02,593
The descendent of N'Jobu.

1038
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,303
Hey, Auntie.

1039
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:09,724
I'm exercising my blood right

1040
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,476
to challenge
for the mantles of king...

1041
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,232
and Black Panther.

1042
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:19,313
Do not do this, T'Challa.

1043
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,654
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,

1044
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,360
he is within his rights.

1045
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:24,823
He has no rights here!

1046
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,079
The challenge will take weeks
to prepare.

1047
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:30,458
Weeks? I don't need weeks.

1048
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:32,869
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.

1049
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:35,209
And somebody to get me
outta these chains.

1050
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:42,128
T'Challa,
what do you know of this?

1051
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,890
I accept your challenge.

1052
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,401
He'll never beat T'Challa.

1053
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:07,661
He should've just come
to the first challenge

1054
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:09,489
and gotten it over with.

1055
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:17,873
The king
will now have the strength

1056
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:20,709
of the Black Panther
stripped away.

1057
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:53,996
Where is Agent Ross?

1058
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,912
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.

1059
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,296
This is your last chance.

1060
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:07,138
Throw down your weapons,

1061
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:09,841
and we can handle this
another way.

1062
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:21,193
I lived my entire life
waitin' for this moment.

1063
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:25,072
I trained, I lied, I killed...

1064
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:26,949
just to get here.

1065
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:31,329
I killed in America,
Afghanistan...

1066
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:34,244
Iraq.

1067
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:37,702
I took life from
my own brothers and sisters

1068
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:38,957
right here on this continent.

1069
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:43,086
And all this death...

1070
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,670
just so I could kill you.

1071
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,522
Let the challenge begin.

1072
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:37,105
Yield!

1073
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:00,208
Snap out of it, T'Challa!

1074
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:21,607
Come on, get up.

1075
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:23,943
Come here.

1076
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:28,942
This is for my father.

1077
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:31,695
Erik!

1078
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:34,118
- Zuri, no.
- Stop!

1079
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:35,702
- Zuri!
- Zuri, don't!

1080
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,864
I am the cause of
your father's death.

1081
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:39,248
Not him.

1082
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:40,954
Take me.

1083
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:43,878
I'll take you both,
Uncle James.

1084
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,380
No!

1085
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:48,925
No! No!

1086
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:51,631
Zuri, no!

1087
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:53,973
No!

1088
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:57,809
No! No! Zuri! Zuri!

1089
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:00,144
No! No!

1090
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,646
Is this your king? Huh?

1091
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:09,191
Is this your king?

1092
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,027
The Black Panther,

1093
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:18,908
who's supposed to
lead you into the future?

1094
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,573
Come on, Brother!

1095
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,071
Is there nothing
that can be done?

1096
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,536
Him?

1097
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:27,792
He's supposed to protect you?

1098
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:41,685
- No.
- No!

1099
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:51,107
No!

1100
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:56,696
Nah. I'm your king.

1101
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:58,531
- No! No!
- We have to go now!

1102
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:00,787
Queen Mother, let's go!

1103
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,325
The Queen Mother and Shuri,
they are safe?

1104
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:40,156
Yes.

1105
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:41,612
Thank you.

1106
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,157
We should get
to them immediately.

1107
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:46,201
I cannot.

1108
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:46,958
What?

1109
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:48,540
Though my heart is with you.

1110
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:52,252
We cannot turn over
our nation to a man

1111
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:54,049
who showed up here
only hours ago.

1112
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:55,136
He is of royal blood.

1113
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:57,549
- He killed T'Challa!
- In ritual combat.

1114
01:22:57,723 --> 01:22:59,555
Does that really matter?

1115
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:05,140
You are the greatest warrior
Wakanda has.

1116
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:09,311
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.

1117
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:10,600
Overthrow?

1118
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:12,643
Nakia!

1119
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:16,856
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!

1120
01:23:18,619 --> 01:23:23,079
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.

1121
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:25,414
What are you loyal to?

1122
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,290
I loved him.

1123
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:34,002
I loved my country, too.

1124
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:36,213
Then you serve your country.

1125
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:39,549
No. I save my country.

1126
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:49,642
What's wrong?

1127
01:23:49,983 --> 01:23:51,394
The king is dead.

1128
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,689
Come with me,
unless you want to join him.

1129
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:16,006
First <i>Baba.</i>

1130
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:19,093
And now my brother.

1131
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:24,765
Mama, we didn't
even get to bury him.

1132
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:35,017
- It's me.
- Nakia. Who is this man?

1133
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:37,027
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.

1134
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:39,233
Where's Okoye?

1135
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:40,405
Okoye is not coming.

1136
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,318
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.

1137
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,582
Wait here.

1138
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:56,964
What has happened
to our Wakanda?

1139
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,460
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

1140
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:04,596
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther...

1141
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:07,554
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

1142
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:45,527
What did I tell you
about going into my things?

1143
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:46,909
Hmm?

1144
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:55,120
What did you find?

1145
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,455
Your home.

1146
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:02,790
I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.

1147
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,836
Yes. The sunsets there

1148
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:08,716
are the most beautiful
in the world.

1149
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,141
But I fear you still may not
be welcome.

1150
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:16,897
Why?

1151
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,728
They will say you are lost.

1152
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,980
But I'm right here.

1153
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:29,741
No tears for me?

1154
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:35,281
Everybody dies.

1155
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:39,076
It's just life around here.

1156
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,374
Well, look at what
I have done.

1157
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:49,462
I should've taken you back
long ago.

1158
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:54,721
Instead, we are both
abandoned here.

1159
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:02,441
Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.

1160
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:06,858
That's why they can't find us.

1161
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:16,284
Breathe!
Breathe, My King, breathe.

1162
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:18,825
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

1163
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:37,430
The Heart-Shaped Herb
did that?

1164
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:41,517
This all of it?

1165
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,557
Yes. So when it comes time
for another king,

1166
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:44,767
we will be ready.

1167
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:46,685
Another king?

1168
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,940
Yeah, go ahead
and burn all that.

1169
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:53,700
My King, we cannot do that.
It is our tradition...

1170
01:28:57,374 --> 01:29:00,332
When I tell you to do
something, I mean that shit.

1171
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,792
Burn it all!

1172
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,421
You know, where I'm from...

1173
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,508
when black folks
started revolutions,

1174
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:01,344
they never had
the firepower...

1175
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:03,603
or the resources
to fight their oppressors.

1176
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:05,848
Where was Wakanda?

1177
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:09,445
Hmm?

1178
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,697
Yeah, all that ends today.

1179
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:16,985
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.

1180
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,869
Already in place.

1181
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:20,370
I know how colonizers think.

1182
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:23,077
So we're gonna use their own
strategy against 'em.

1183
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:26,952
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.

1184
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,838
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...

1185
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:32,420
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.

1186
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:34,255
And their children.

1187
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:36,087
And anyone else
who takes their side.

1188
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,722
It's time they know
the truth about us!

1189
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:40,508
We're warriors!

1190
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:43,848
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.

1191
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:48,766
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.

1192
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:52,189
Wakanda has survived
for so long...

1193
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:55,652
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.

1194
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:58,442
Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.

1195
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:02,203
But the world is changing,
General.

1196
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:06,371
Elders, it is getting smaller.

1197
01:31:06,544 --> 01:31:08,410
The outside world
is catching up...

1198
01:31:08,588 --> 01:31:10,579
and soon it will be
the conquerors

1199
01:31:10,674 --> 01:31:12,756
or the conquered.

1200
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,380
I'd rather be the former.

1201
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:21,173
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.

1202
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:24,256
<i>So where are we
going again?</i>

1203
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:25,928
<i>We're taking
the Heart-Shaped Herb</i>

1204
01:31:26,022 --> 01:31:27,022
to Jabariland.

1205
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:28,806
Heart-Shaped Herb?
What is that?

1206
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:31,396
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.

1207
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:34,152
It's what made T'Challa
so strong.

1208
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:35,733
Nakia.

1209
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,986
I don't like this.

1210
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:43,904
The Herb belongs to us.

1211
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:47,291
We may be creating
a bigger monster with M'Baku.

1212
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:57,126
Nakia, you should
take it yourself.

1213
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:01,089
I am a spy with no army.

1214
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:04,216
I wouldn't stand a chance.

1215
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:07,511
We'll go.

1216
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:15,440
Oh, boy.

1217
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:22,075
Oh, shit.

1218
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:25,070
Look down. Stay calm.

1219
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:26,248
Shuri.

1220
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:28,953
Look down.

1221
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:05,573
My son...

1222
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:10,244
was murdered in ritual combat.

1223
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,872
- Were the odds fair?
- Yes, but...

1224
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:14,628
So it was less a murder
than a defeat.

1225
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:16,664
- Do not rub our noses in it!
- Silence!

1226
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:20,425
I make
the pronouncements here, girl.

1227
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:23,257
Look, uh, Your Highness,
the new king is a U.S...

1228
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,223
The new king...

1229
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:37,275
You cannot talk!

1230
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:38,810
One more word,

1231
01:33:38,905 --> 01:33:41,146
and I will feed you
to my children.

1232
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:47,535
I'm kidding.
We are vegetarians.

1233
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:58,047
Great Gorilla M'Baku...

1234
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:03,840
this is why we are here.

1235
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,801
To offer this to you.

1236
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:09,926
An outsider
sits on our throne.

1237
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,935
Only you can help us stop him.

1238
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:30,825
Come with me.

1239
01:34:47,182 --> 01:34:49,219
Impossible!

1240
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:56,141
Is he breathing?

1241
01:34:56,316 --> 01:34:59,058
He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.

1242
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:01,105
<i>One of our fishermen found him</i>

1243
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:02,812
<i>at the edge
of the river border.</i>

1244
01:35:02,989 --> 01:35:04,275
<i>He brought him to me.</i>

1245
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:06,190
Why do you have him
in the snow?

1246
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:07,595
It is the only thing
keeping him

1247
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:08,699
from joining the ancestors.

1248
01:35:08,828 --> 01:35:11,365
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.

1249
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:13,075
Take him.
He'll be dead in seconds.

1250
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:16,408
Nakia, the Herb.

1251
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:35,268
I call upon the ancestors.

1252
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,687
I call upon Bast.

1253
01:35:38,191 --> 01:35:41,149
I am here
with my son, T'Challa.

1254
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:43,651
Heal him.

1255
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:58,541
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!

1256
01:35:58,711 --> 01:35:59,951
Okay.

1257
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:13,389
Praise the ancestors.

1258
01:36:13,559 --> 01:36:14,559
Praise the ancestors.

1259
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:17,143
Praise the ancestors.

1260
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,600
Praise the ancestors.

1261
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,107
Wake up, T'Challa.

1262
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:24,692
<i>Wake up.</i>

1263
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:28,529
My son.

1264
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:37,823
The time has come
for you to come home...

1265
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,413
and be reunited with me.

1266
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:52,800
Why?

1267
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:58,017
Why didn't you
bring the boy home?

1268
01:36:59,772 --> 01:37:01,262
Why, <i>Baba?</i>

1269
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:04,315
He...

1270
01:37:05,278 --> 01:37:08,566
He was the truth
I chose to omit.

1271
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:12,316
You were wrong to abandon him.

1272
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:14,359
I chose my people.

1273
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:17,741
I chose Wakanda.

1274
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:19,781
Our future depended...

1275
01:37:19,959 --> 01:37:21,495
You were wrong!

1276
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:23,910
All of you were wrong!

1277
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:27,877
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!

1278
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:32,130
We let the fear
of our discovery

1279
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:34,804
stop us from doing
what is right!

1280
01:37:35,892 --> 01:37:37,223
No more!

1281
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:44,765
I cannot stay here with you.

1282
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:50,813
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.

1283
01:37:51,324 --> 01:37:54,362
He is a monster
of our own making.

1284
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:59,371
I must take the mantle back.
I must!

1285
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:04,079
I must right these wrongs.

1286
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:16,592
Do you have a blanket?

1287
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:21,226
Killmonger
has the full support

1288
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,473
of our military.

1289
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:26,769
And he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.

1290
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:28,975
Of course he did.

1291
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:30,856
That's what he was
trained to do.

1292
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,646
His unit used to work
with the CIA

1293
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,572
to destabilize
foreign countries.

1294
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:36,824
They would always strike
at transitions of power...

1295
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:39,156
like an election year,
or the death of a monarch.

1296
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,697
You get control of government,
the military...

1297
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:43,956
- Our resources.
- Right.

1298
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:46,086
The Great Mound.

1299
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:47,915
Our vibranium,
all of my designs.

1300
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:50,751
He will send our weapons
all over the world.

1301
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:56,382
You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.

1302
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:57,556
- What?
- What about you?

1303
01:38:58,474 --> 01:39:00,431
The challenge
will have to continue.

1304
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:03,889
T'Challa, we will not
leave Wakanda.

1305
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:06,054
It is my duty
to keep you safe.

1306
01:39:06,232 --> 01:39:08,724
If he gets control
of our technology,

1307
01:39:08,818 --> 01:39:10,149
nowhere will be safe.

1308
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:32,709
The Black Panther lives.

1309
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:35,758
And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda...

1310
01:39:35,928 --> 01:39:38,465
I will be right there
beside him.

1311
01:39:39,599 --> 01:39:40,805
As will I.

1312
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:42,507
I'm in, too.

1313
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:46,352
What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

1314
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,061
Are you done?

1315
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:54,273
Are you done?

1316
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:58,986
Could you give me
and Lord M'Baku a moment?

1317
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:08,617
Thank you.

1318
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:11,536
I owed you a great debt.

1319
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,922
A life for a life.

1320
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:15,627
Consider it paid.

1321
01:40:16,302 --> 01:40:18,509
Please allow my mother
to stay here.

1322
01:40:19,305 --> 01:40:22,218
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.

1323
01:40:23,392 --> 01:40:26,054
You know, I could use
an army as well.

1324
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,846
I bet you could.

1325
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:30,180
But no.

1326
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:34,476
I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.

1327
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:36,315
It is our cause.

1328
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:39,239
- It is for all of us.
- Oh, us?

1329
01:40:39,408 --> 01:40:41,649
Us? You are the first king
to come here in centuries...

1330
01:40:41,827 --> 01:40:45,786
and now you speak of "us"?

1331
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:49,745
I cannot speak for past kings.

1332
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:53,245
But an enemy sits
on the throne right now.

1333
01:40:53,422 --> 01:40:56,289
We both know the power
of vibranium.

1334
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:59,050
If Killmonger
gains control of it,

1335
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:01,093
who do you think
he will come for next?

1336
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:12,101
We will not help you.

1337
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:42,030
Everything is on schedule.

1338
01:41:42,054 --> 01:41:43,215
Have the spies been alerted?

1339
01:41:43,389 --> 01:41:45,505
Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.

1340
01:41:45,891 --> 01:41:47,381
But the War Dogs in London,

1341
01:41:47,476 --> 01:41:49,262
New York and Hong Kong
are standing by.

1342
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:52,554
We'll strike there first.

1343
01:41:52,732 --> 01:41:54,518
The others'll come around.

1344
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:56,057
Look at this.

1345
01:41:56,235 --> 01:41:57,316
A handheld sonic cannon,

1346
01:41:57,403 --> 01:41:58,768
powerful enough
to stop a tank...

1347
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:00,562
untraceable by
metal detectors.

1348
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:02,777
And we got thousands of them.

1349
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:08,070
The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.

1350
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:40,818
He lives.

1351
01:42:44,867 --> 01:42:46,778
N'Jadaka!

1352
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:49,235
Wassup?

1353
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:51,154
I never yielded!

1354
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:55,625
And as you can see,
I am not dead!

1355
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,252
All that challenge shit
is over with!

1356
01:42:58,339 --> 01:42:59,454
I'm the king now!

1357
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:01,839
Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!

1358
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:12,029
- Shuri, now.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

1359
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:17,980
Go, go, go!
Come on, Ross!

1360
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:20,608
W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.

1361
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:24,820
W'Kabi, the challenge
is not complete.

1362
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:30,030
What will we do?

1363
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:32,536
Border Tribe!

1364
01:43:46,595 --> 01:43:47,595
You!

1365
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:50,095
Your heart
is so full of hatred...

1366
01:43:50,266 --> 01:43:52,098
you are not fit to be a king!

1367
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,595
Come on!

1368
01:43:57,773 --> 01:43:58,773
Ayo, the king!

1369
01:44:14,373 --> 01:44:15,408
Shields!

1370
01:44:46,071 --> 01:44:47,071
Ah!

1371
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:51,865
W'Kabi, stop this!

1372
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:54,610
Stop this now!

1373
01:44:58,793 --> 01:44:59,793
No!

1374
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:30,613
Nakia and I will get control
of the <i>Royal Talon</i> with this.

1375
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:32,239
So what do I do?

1376
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:33,490
You'll have to fly it.

1377
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:36,281
- What?
- You were a great pilot.

1378
01:45:36,455 --> 01:45:38,492
Don't worry,
I'll guide you through it.

1379
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:40,782
It's just like riding
a hoverbike.

1380
01:45:41,502 --> 01:45:43,163
What? You guys
have hoverbikes?

1381
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:45,123
Hey, Nakia, take that.

1382
01:45:45,297 --> 01:45:48,039
- I'm not a Dora.
- Just put it on, it's armor!

1383
01:45:49,552 --> 01:45:50,587
Come!

1384
01:45:53,013 --> 01:45:54,174
Good luck, Agent Ross!

1385
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:55,784
Yeah, I don't know
what I'm doing with this.

1386
01:45:55,808 --> 01:45:57,173
We're counting on you.

1387
01:46:09,864 --> 01:46:11,229
Wakanda forever.

1388
01:46:19,456 --> 01:46:20,456
Come on!

1389
01:46:30,968 --> 01:46:32,083
Go, go!

1390
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:40,842
<i>Remote
piloting system activated.</i>

1391
01:46:41,896 --> 01:46:42,896
My God.

1392
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:46,101
<i>I made it American
style for you. Get in.</i>

1393
01:46:46,275 --> 01:46:47,811
All right.

1394
01:46:53,991 --> 01:46:54,991
Yes!

1395
01:46:57,077 --> 01:46:59,785
Go! We can't let those weapons
get beyond Wakanda.

1396
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:02,825
All right, I'm on it.

1397
01:47:19,975 --> 01:47:21,215
Lock!

1398
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:23,600
Get him down!

1399
01:47:23,812 --> 01:47:25,394
Get the necklace!

1400
01:47:25,856 --> 01:47:27,438
Get the necklace!

1401
01:47:34,114 --> 01:47:36,196
Wakanda forever!

1402
01:47:43,999 --> 01:47:46,240
Okay, Shuri. I got 'em.
What do I do?

1403
01:47:46,418 --> 01:47:47,783
Shoot them down, genius!

1404
01:47:47,962 --> 01:47:48,962
All right.

1405
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:51,624
Here goes nothing.

1406
01:47:58,889 --> 01:48:00,004
All right, got them.

1407
01:48:04,353 --> 01:48:05,593
Oh, shit.

1408
01:48:06,563 --> 01:48:08,304
Shit, Shit, shit.

1409
01:48:28,585 --> 01:48:29,785
Nice!

1410
01:49:04,913 --> 01:49:05,948
Shuri!

1411
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:11,617
What's up, Princess?

1412
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:13,877
You'll never be a true king.

1413
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:17,842
Brother!

1414
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,286
Shuri.

1415
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:52,710
Brother!

1416
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:55,248
Turn on the train
on the bottom track.

1417
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:57,459
<i>The stabilizers
will deactivate your suit!</i>

1418
01:49:57,633 --> 01:49:58,964
You won't have protection!

1419
01:49:59,134 --> 01:50:00,465
Neither will he.

1420
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:02,001
Okay!

1421
01:50:26,078 --> 01:50:28,319
I don't need a suit
to kill you.

1422
01:50:28,497 --> 01:50:29,703
Your reign is over!

1423
01:50:29,873 --> 01:50:31,455
You sat up here,
safe and protected.

1424
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:33,036
You want to
see us become

1425
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:35,038
just like the people
you hate so much.

1426
01:50:35,212 --> 01:50:36,953
Divide and conquer the land
as they did!

1427
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:39,543
Nah, I learn from my enemies.
Beat them at they own game.

1428
01:50:39,716 --> 01:50:40,956
You have become them!

1429
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:43,627
You will destroy the world,
Wakanda included!

1430
01:50:43,804 --> 01:50:45,545
The world took
everything away from me!

1431
01:50:45,722 --> 01:50:47,212
Everything I ever loved!

1432
01:50:47,391 --> 01:50:48,847
But I'mma make sure
we're even.

1433
01:50:49,017 --> 01:50:50,203
I'mma track down
anyone who would

1434
01:50:50,227 --> 01:50:51,717
even think
about being loyal to you!

1435
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:53,289
And I'm gonna put
they ass in the dirt

1436
01:50:53,313 --> 01:50:54,394
right next to Zuri!

1437
01:50:56,692 --> 01:50:57,978
Nakia!

1438
01:51:01,113 --> 01:51:02,899
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay. You?

1439
01:51:03,073 --> 01:51:04,814
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1440
01:51:11,957 --> 01:51:14,244
Shuri, I've lost one of them,
but two are on my tail.

1441
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:17,876
Shit. What the hell was that?

1442
01:51:18,046 --> 01:51:19,440
<i>The lab is under attack.</i>

1443
01:51:19,464 --> 01:51:20,499
What? Where?

1444
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:22,502
<i>Deactivating hologram.</i>

1445
01:51:26,555 --> 01:51:29,388
<i>Ross, you have to
get out of there, now!</i>

1446
01:51:29,975 --> 01:51:31,340
How long have I got?

1447
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:35,098
<i>Glass integrity is at 50%.</i>

1448
01:51:35,898 --> 01:51:36,933
Put me back in.

1449
01:51:37,107 --> 01:51:38,814
<i>Ross! Ross!</i>

1450
01:51:57,711 --> 01:51:59,201
Surrender now!

1451
01:51:59,671 --> 01:52:02,538
You have three seconds
to lay down your weapon!

1452
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:03,831
One!

1453
01:52:03,967 --> 01:52:04,967
Two!

1454
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:19,264
Witness the might
of the Jabari firsthand!

1455
01:53:00,357 --> 01:53:02,689
<i>Glass integrity is at 15%.</i>

1456
01:53:11,576 --> 01:53:13,533
<i>- Critical weapons failure.</i>
- Shit!

1457
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:20,366
Hey, Shuri!
The last cargo ship

1458
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:21,700
is almost at the border...

1459
01:53:21,878 --> 01:53:23,189
but they got me trapped
with some kind of cables.

1460
01:53:23,213 --> 01:53:24,499
Make an X with your arms!

1461
01:53:25,299 --> 01:53:27,506
<i>Sonic Overload initiated.</i>

1462
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:29,508
Now break it!

1463
01:53:38,437 --> 01:53:40,348
<i>System rebooting in five...</i>

1464
01:53:40,814 --> 01:53:42,896
<i>four, three...</i>

1465
01:53:43,066 --> 01:53:44,682
<i>two, one.</i>

1466
01:53:45,277 --> 01:53:46,392
<i>System rebooted.</i>

1467
01:53:58,707 --> 01:54:00,038
Yes! We did it!

1468
01:54:00,208 --> 01:54:01,744
<i>Great!
Now get out of there!</i>

1469
01:54:12,929 --> 01:54:14,215
Charge!

1470
01:54:34,034 --> 01:54:36,366
Drop your weapon!

1471
01:54:37,913 --> 01:54:40,075
Would you kill me, my love?

1472
01:54:40,248 --> 01:54:41,704
For Wakanda?

1473
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:46,710
Without question!

1474
01:55:30,715 --> 01:55:32,251
This is it for you, Cousin.

1475
01:55:57,993 --> 01:55:59,529
Hell of a move!

1476
01:56:20,724 --> 01:56:22,306
My pop said Wakanda was

1477
01:56:22,392 --> 01:56:23,974
the most beautiful thing
he ever seen.

1478
01:56:27,689 --> 01:56:30,181
He promised he was gonna
show it to me one day.

1479
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:33,442
You believe that?

1480
01:56:34,321 --> 01:56:35,436
Kid from Oakland,

1481
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:37,396
running around
believing in fairy tales.

1482
01:57:25,789 --> 01:57:27,700
It's beautiful.

1483
01:57:41,888 --> 01:57:44,300
Maybe we can still heal you.

1484
01:57:46,726 --> 01:57:47,887
Why?

1485
01:57:49,688 --> 01:57:51,895
So you can just lock me up?

1486
01:57:55,151 --> 01:57:56,482
Nah.

1487
01:57:58,697 --> 01:58:00,358
Just bury me in the ocean...

1488
01:58:00,532 --> 01:58:03,069
with my ancestors
that jumped from the ships.

1489
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:07,278
'Cause they knew
death was better than bondage.

1490
01:59:31,831 --> 01:59:32,831
Thank you.

1491
01:59:34,834 --> 01:59:36,416
You saved me.

1492
01:59:37,337 --> 01:59:39,453
You saved my family.

1493
01:59:41,675 --> 01:59:43,086
Our nation.

1494
01:59:43,259 --> 01:59:45,591
There's nothing
to thank me for.

1495
01:59:45,762 --> 01:59:47,298
It is our duty to...

1496
01:59:50,934 --> 01:59:53,596
It was my duty to fight
for what I love.

1497
01:59:54,646 --> 01:59:55,646
I should've...

1498
02:00:02,362 --> 02:00:04,569
You can't blame me,
I almost died.

1499
02:00:08,243 --> 02:00:09,483
Stay.

1500
02:00:11,955 --> 02:00:13,195
I think I know a way

1501
02:00:13,289 --> 02:00:15,530
you can still fulfill
your calling.

1502
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:18,121
Please stay.

1503
02:00:51,244 --> 02:00:52,985
Oh, he moves it!
He moves it!

1504
02:00:53,163 --> 02:00:54,824
- Who man is that?
- Bucket!

1505
02:00:54,998 --> 02:00:55,998
Easy.

1506
02:00:59,002 --> 02:01:00,333
When you said
you would take me

1507
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:02,331
to California
for the first time...

1508
02:01:02,505 --> 02:01:04,462
I thought
you meant Coachella...

1509
02:01:04,632 --> 02:01:06,088
or Disneyland.

1510
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:08,171
Why here?

1511
02:01:11,306 --> 02:01:14,765
This is where our father
killed our uncle.

1512
02:01:19,981 --> 02:01:21,722
They're tearing it down.

1513
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:23,817
Good.

1514
02:01:23,985 --> 02:01:25,976
They are not tearing it down.

1515
02:01:27,113 --> 02:01:28,729
I bought this building.

1516
02:01:30,784 --> 02:01:32,695
And that building.

1517
02:01:33,536 --> 02:01:35,277
And that one over there.

1518
02:01:36,498 --> 02:01:37,784
This will be the first

1519
02:01:37,874 --> 02:01:40,206
Wakandan International
Outreach Center.

1520
02:01:41,461 --> 02:01:44,123
Nakia will oversee
the social outreach.

1521
02:01:44,881 --> 02:01:46,121
And you will spearhead

1522
02:01:46,216 --> 02:01:48,378
the science
and information exchange.

1523
02:01:49,093 --> 02:01:51,050
You're kidding.

1524
02:01:51,429 --> 02:01:52,715
Eh?

1525
02:02:01,981 --> 02:02:03,016
Oh...

1526
02:02:03,107 --> 02:02:06,020
Hey, yo.
Man, what the hell is that?

1527
02:02:06,194 --> 02:02:07,901
That's like
a Bugatti spaceship!

1528
02:02:08,071 --> 02:02:10,654
Bro, it came out of nowhere.
Did y'all see that?

1529
02:02:13,785 --> 02:02:14,946
What?

1530
02:02:16,788 --> 02:02:17,788
Check it out, bro.

1531
02:02:17,956 --> 02:02:19,321
We can take this back
to the house.

1532
02:02:20,625 --> 02:02:21,706
Pull up to school in this.

1533
02:02:21,793 --> 02:02:23,750
Look, we can break it apart.
We can sell it.

1534
02:02:23,837 --> 02:02:24,837
On eBay.

1535
02:02:24,921 --> 02:02:26,148
Everybody get, like,
a million apiece.

1536
02:02:26,172 --> 02:02:27,483
I wouldn't do that
if I were you guys.

1537
02:02:27,507 --> 02:02:28,692
- Where you come from?
- From Wakanda.

1538
02:02:28,716 --> 02:02:29,831
What is a Wakanda?

1539
02:02:29,926 --> 02:02:30,926
KID 5; Hey, yo!

1540
02:02:31,636 --> 02:02:32,842
This yours?

1541
02:02:36,641 --> 02:02:37,972
Who...

1542
02:02:38,351 --> 02:02:39,512
Who are you?

1543
02:05:25,518 --> 02:05:27,680
<i>My name is King T'Challa...</i>

1544
02:05:27,854 --> 02:05:29,970
<i>son of King T'Chaka.</i>

1545
02:05:30,148 --> 02:05:34,483
<i>I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.</i>

1546
02:05:34,652 --> 02:05:37,394
<i>And for the first time
in our history...</i>

1547
02:05:37,572 --> 02:05:40,781
<i>we will be sharing
our knowledge and resources...</i>

1548
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:42,816
<i>with the outside world.</i>

1549
02:05:42,994 --> 02:05:46,362
<i>Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.</i>

1550
02:05:46,539 --> 02:05:47,950
<i>We cannot.</i>

1551
02:05:49,083 --> 02:05:50,573
<i>We must not.</i>

1552
02:05:50,918 --> 02:05:53,535
<i>We will work to be an example
of how we...</i>

1553
02:05:53,713 --> 02:05:55,954
<i>as brothers and sisters
on this earth...</i>

1554
02:05:56,132 --> 02:05:58,169
<i>should treat each other.</i>

1555
02:05:58,342 --> 02:06:00,174
<i>Now, more than ever...</i>

1556
02:06:01,429 --> 02:06:05,844
<i>the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.</i>

1557
02:06:06,267 --> 02:06:08,178
<i>We all know the truth.</i>

1558
02:06:08,352 --> 02:06:11,765
<i>More connects us
than separates us.</i>

1559
02:06:11,939 --> 02:06:13,646
<i>But in times of crisis...</i>

1560
02:06:13,816 --> 02:06:16,274
<i>the wise build bridges...</i>

1561
02:06:16,444 --> 02:06:19,232
<i>while the foolish
build barriers.</i>

1562
02:06:19,405 --> 02:06:21,442
<i>We must find a way...</i>

1563
02:06:21,616 --> 02:06:24,233
<i>to look after one another...</i>

1564
02:06:24,410 --> 02:06:29,120
<i>as if we were one,
single tribe.</i>

1565
02:06:29,290 --> 02:06:30,770
<i>With all due respect,
King T'Challa...</i>

1566
02:06:30,917 --> 02:06:32,157
<i>what can a nation of farmers</i>

1567
02:06:32,251 --> 02:06:34,117
<i>have to offer
the rest of the world?</i>

1568
02:13:33,714 --> 02:13:35,705
Are you playing around
with that man again?

1569
02:13:35,799 --> 02:13:37,079
- No.
- You're teasing him again.

1570
02:13:38,219 --> 02:13:40,335
- Don't wake him. He must rest.
- No, I'm not.

1571
02:13:41,305 --> 02:13:42,670
No, I'm not.

1572
02:13:43,641 --> 02:13:44,881
Thabo,
you're doing that.

1573
02:13:45,017 --> 02:13:46,382
He's doing it.
He's lying.

1574
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:47,971
No, he's resting.

1575
02:13:48,270 --> 02:13:49,476
Go, go!

1576
02:13:49,647 --> 02:13:51,433
White Wolf!

1577
02:13:51,565 --> 02:13:52,709
Stop that!

1578
02:13:52,733 --> 02:13:53,853
White Wolf!

1579
02:13:56,612 --> 02:13:58,292
Good morning, Sergeant Barnes.

1580
02:13:59,740 --> 02:14:00,740
Bucky.

1581
02:14:02,368 --> 02:14:03,403
How are you feeling?

1582
02:14:04,036 --> 02:14:05,036
Good.

1583
02:14:07,665 --> 02:14:08,746
Thank you.

1584
02:14:08,832 --> 02:14:10,368
Come.

1585
02:14:11,877 --> 02:14:13,743
Much more for you to learn.
