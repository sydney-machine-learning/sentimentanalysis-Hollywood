00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:19,893
Jules Verne once wrote

3
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:22,767
Put two ships in the open sea

4
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,831
without wind or tide, it will come together.

5
00:00:47,794 --> 00:00:49,922
That's how my parents met.

6
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:52,831
Like two ships destined for each other.

7
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,975
Hey, it's ok.

8
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:17,691
Easy, easy, easy.

9
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:19,886
You weren't breathing.

10
00:01:32,772 --> 00:01:34,934
They were from different worlds.

11
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:41,772
But life, like the sea,
has a way of bringing people together.

12
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,794
I was gonna make you some eggs.

13
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,956
Just don't eat my dog, ok?

14
00:02:35,935 --> 00:02:38,962
It's ok. It's ok. I made tea.

15
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:47,709
Come, try it. It'll
make you better.

16
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:02,801
So, who are you?

17
00:03:05,907 --> 00:03:07,876
Atlantian.

18
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:11,877
Queen of Atlantis.

19
00:03:12,914 --> 00:03:18,979
Wow. I'm Tom. Keeper of lighthouse.

20
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:54,879
She had fled an arranged marriage,
left her whole world behind.

21
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:58,051
But in my father's lighthouse,
she found something

22
00:03:58,059 --> 00:04:00,028
unexpected.

23
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,858
And my father, found
the love of his life.

24
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:17,911
How about Arthur?

25
00:04:17,912 --> 00:04:19,972
After the hurricane.

26
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:24,042
Afterall, he's a king, no?

27
00:04:24,085 --> 00:04:26,919
He's more than that.

28
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:30,824
He's living proof our people
can co-exist.

29
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:33,953
He could unite our worlds
one day.

30
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:45,862
And the Trident could only be wielded
by the strongest Atlantean.

31
00:04:45,873 --> 00:04:50,937
And it gave the king mastery
of the seven seas.

32
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:55,781
Made him so powerful.
the ocean became so jealous,

33
00:04:55,816 --> 00:04:59,878
and sent a terrible earthquake
to destroy Atlantis.

34
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,890
Down it fell to the bottom of the ocean.

35
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,018
But legend has it that one day

36
00:05:05,026 --> 00:05:07,018
a new king will come

37
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:09,087
who will use the power of the Trident

38
00:05:09,096 --> 00:05:12,897
to put Atlantis back together again.

39
00:05:18,873 --> 00:05:20,808
Tom, take him!

40
00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:40,794
Queen Atlanna.

41
00:05:40,828 --> 00:05:42,057
By the authority of King Orvax,

42
00:05:42,096 --> 00:05:45,066
You re ordered to return to Atlantis.

43
00:05:45,066 --> 00:05:46,967
Atlanna!

44
00:06:10,717 --> 00:06:13,744
Tom! Here!

45
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:42,806
The two worlds were never meant to meet

46
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:46,616
and I was a product of a love that
never should have been.

47
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:48,747
You don't have to do this,
Atlantean. Please.

48
00:06:48,788 --> 00:06:54,819
Tom. They will always find me.
Next time they will send an army.

49
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:58,688
I have to go back.

50
00:06:58,698 --> 00:07:01,668
It's the only way to save him.

51
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,796
To save you.

52
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:12,777
Where I come from,

53
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,739
the sea carries our tears away.

54
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:23,822
Not here. You'd feel it.

55
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:36,601
I will return to you
when it's safe.

56
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:37,865
One day.

57
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:40,874
Right here. At sunrise.

58
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,679
We'll be together again.

59
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,817
You stay strong, my little prince.
I'll always be with you.

60
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,755
Don't let him forget me.

61
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:40,794
Now today, we have better maps of Mars
than our own sea floor.

62
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:46,639
Come on. Come over here.
Boys, stop.

63
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:50,837
Hi, fishy.

64
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:55,747
My name's Arthur. What's yours?

65
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:57,680
You guys hungry?

66
00:08:57,717 --> 00:09:01,813
Check it out. Arthur is talking to the fish.

67
00:09:01,854 --> 00:09:03,720
You're such a prick, Arthur.

68
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:06,625
Stop! Stop it!

69
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:09,721
Stop! Let me go!

70
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:12,150
Move it! Come on, hurry up!

71
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:23,119
Sir, we've secured the captain.

72
00:11:23,163 --> 00:11:26,258
Distress signal disabled.
We're running dark in here.

73
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:28,292
Well they heard it, you can count on it.

74
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:30,327
I'll make you a deal.

75
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:33,204
I won't tell you how to captain,

76
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:35,334
and you don't tell me how to pirate.

77
00:11:46,353 --> 00:11:52,224
Where's the rest of the crew?
They've sealed themselves up in the torpedo bay.

78
00:11:52,225 --> 00:11:53,352
Our reputation precedes us.

79
00:11:53,393 --> 00:11:57,228
Your reputation. This is your win.

80
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:03,169
Here.

81
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,207
You take this piece of junk,
this is part of your life.

82
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:12,369
I never told you the story behind it.

83
00:12:12,412 --> 00:12:15,246
This was your grandfather's.

84
00:12:15,248 --> 00:12:19,276
He was one of the navy first
fought in World War 2.

85
00:12:19,319 --> 00:12:20,287
He was so stealthy in the water.

86
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:24,222
His unit nicknamed him Manta.

87
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:28,192
But after the war, his country
forgot about him

88
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:32,097
So he went back to the seas,
scavenging and surviving with his wit.

89
00:12:32,232 --> 00:12:38,263
And this knife, he gave it to me
when I was your age.

90
00:12:40,306 --> 00:12:42,298
And now, it's yours, son.

91
00:13:11,304 --> 00:13:13,205
We just hit something.

92
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:19,236
No. Something hit us./
Sir, there's something out there.

93
00:13:19,245 --> 00:13:22,272
Another submarine? /No.
I think it's a man.

94
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:12,188
That's not a man.

95
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:19,361
Stopper, to the right.
Bravo team, clear the passageway.

96
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:43,330
Permission to come on board.

97
00:16:44,183 --> 00:16:46,345
I've waited a long time for this.

98
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:01,224
Am I supposed to know who you are?

99
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:04,201
I scavenge the high seas.

100
00:17:05,138 --> 00:17:06,333
You're the Aquaman.

101
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:09,103
We're about to meet at some point.

102
00:17:12,412 --> 00:17:14,347
Let's not make it happen.

103
00:18:10,236 --> 00:18:12,171
Ow!

104
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,375
Dad!

105
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,380
Dad.

106
00:18:32,225 --> 00:18:34,285
That's your kid?

107
00:18:38,297 --> 00:18:40,391
Shame on you.

108
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:44,397
You get yourself into this mess,
get yourself out of this.

109
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:46,201
Bastard!

110
00:19:09,362 --> 00:19:12,196
Wait! Help me he's trapped!

111
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:14,291
You can't leave him like this!

112
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:17,132
Please!

113
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:19,162
You killed innocent people.

114
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:21,333
You ask the sea for mercy.

115
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,188
Get out of here!

116
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:38,158
I'll never leave you.

117
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:41,351
You need to live so that you can kill
that son of a bitch.

118
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:48,357
Now, go!

119
00:19:55,374 --> 00:19:57,309
Go!

120
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,161
Damn you!

121
00:20:16,162 --> 00:20:18,131
Go.

122
00:21:36,142 --> 00:21:38,202
I'll always know where to find you.

123
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,202
Old habits.

124
00:21:48,321 --> 00:21:50,381
Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.

125
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:58,188
You want me to hand it in a sippy cup for you.

126
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,332
How is it that I could breathe underwater
and lose the drink on the table with you.

127
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:08,102
That's my superpower.

128
00:22:12,178 --> 00:22:15,307
The same pirate who are suspected

129
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:19,183
to be connected with the disappearance of the Navy's
high classified prototype stealth submarine.

130
00:22:19,218 --> 00:22:22,382
And in further development, we now have unconfirmed reports

131
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:26,291
that the meta-human dubbed by social media
as the Aquaman

132
00:22:26,325 --> 00:22:29,124
was responsible for this daring rescue…

133
00:22:29,128 --> 00:22:30,289
It's not me.

134
00:22:30,296 --> 00:22:34,233
Oh shit. You're doing it, aren't you?

135
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:37,168
What Vulco trained you to do.

136
00:22:37,203 --> 00:22:41,106
I knew you couldn't stand on the sidelines forever.

137
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:44,304
Your mother always knew you were
special./ Don't even start.

138
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,213
She believed you'd be the one to unite our two worlds.

139
00:22:48,214 --> 00:22:50,183
Please, stop.

140
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:56,154
Whatever Atlantis's problem are, you're bigger than them.

141
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:58,215
Atlantis murdered my mother.

142
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:01,159
You didn't know that for sure./ Yes, I do.

143
00:23:01,193 --> 00:23:05,130
They took her, for loving you and having me.

144
00:23:05,364 --> 00:23:08,129
And you know it.

145
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:15,205
Son, one day you'd have to stop blaming yourself.

146
00:23:21,247 --> 00:23:23,239
Hey buddy.

147
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:27,114
You'd that fish boy from the TV?

148
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:29,185
Oh, great.

149
00:23:35,227 --> 00:23:38,254
Hey fish man. What'd you want?

150
00:23:38,364 --> 00:23:40,356
I'll tell you what I want.

151
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,238
Can I get a picture with you?

152
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:48,264
You're like our local hero, man.

153
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:53,111
It'll be quick.

154
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:59,311
Whatever./Alright. Let's do this.

155
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:02,288
Dont' touch me./Right, that's exactly
what I'd want to do down here.

156
00:24:02,321 --> 00:24:04,347
Here we go.
Everybody smile.

157
00:24:58,144 --> 00:25:01,239
He understands the significance of this meeting.

158
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,215
He'll hear you out.

159
00:25:22,234 --> 00:25:25,170
King Orm./King Nereus.

160
00:25:25,171 --> 00:25:28,198
You pick a meeting place too close to the
surface to my liking.

161
00:25:28,207 --> 00:25:30,199
You don't recognise the council of the kings?

162
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:36,274
At the site where the seven kings were one.
Our ancestors gathered here.

163
00:25:37,116 --> 00:25:39,381
…Sat here at the head of the table.

164
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:43,855
Xebel were always by his side.

165
00:25:43,855 --> 00:25:49,852
Brine, Fishermen, Deserters and Trench had not yet followed.
Lost nations had not yet vanished.

166
00:25:49,928 --> 00:25:53,956
Together we were the greatest empire the world had ever seen.

167
00:25:53,965 --> 00:25:58,801
But now, several long wars shattered by archaic laws and politics

168
00:25:58,837 --> 00:26:00,863
While the threat above us grows undeniable.

169
00:26:00,872 --> 00:26:02,966
Violence has always plagued the surface.

170
00:26:03,808 --> 00:26:05,800
They will destroy themselves.

171
00:26:05,877 --> 00:26:07,937
Not before destroying us first.

172
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:10,848
We have been hiding long enough.

173
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:14,843
The time has come for
Atlantis to rise again.

174
00:26:14,886 --> 00:26:17,856
We honour you King Nereus…

175
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:23,089
by inviting Xebel to be the first kingdom
to join King Orm's alliance.

176
00:26:23,094 --> 00:26:25,859
As if you have a choice, Vulko.

177
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:28,993
By law you need four to seven kingdoms to send an attack.

178
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,902
The lost nations and the Deserters have long perished.

179
00:26:31,937 --> 00:26:33,997
The Trench were nothing but anglers.

180
00:26:34,005 --> 00:26:36,941
The Brine wouldn't join you, and
the Fishermen are cowards.

181
00:26:36,942 --> 00:26:39,002
With only my army to convince them,

182
00:26:39,044 --> 00:26:41,878
your plans are still burnt.

183
00:26:41,913 --> 00:26:44,041
But I know what you really want.

184
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:46,917
Once you'd obtained the pledge of the four kingdoms,

185
00:26:46,918 --> 00:26:48,944
you will be deemed

186
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:51,957
Ocean Master.

187
00:26:51,957 --> 00:26:56,053
That's merely a title./I'm not a fool King Orm.

188
00:26:56,061 --> 00:27:00,795
As Ocean Master you'll be commander of
the greatest military might on this planet.

189
00:27:00,832 --> 00:27:03,825
I'm the natural choice to lead it.

190
00:27:04,002 --> 00:27:06,801
Are you?

191
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:09,832
What about the rumours there is another?

192
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:12,867
An Atlantian living on the surface

193
00:27:12,877 --> 00:27:15,813
One of royal blood.

194
00:27:15,814 --> 00:27:19,808
You may sit on the throne of Atlantis.

195
00:27:19,951 --> 00:27:21,920
But your claim is just weak.
How can you possibly hope to unite the empire?

196
00:27:22,453 --> 00:27:25,514
My mother's bastard has never even been to Atlantis.

197
00:27:25,523 --> 00:27:26,582
His loyalty is to the…

198
00:27:37,502 --> 00:27:39,562
Surface dwellers! Move out!

199
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:02,457
The king is injured!

200
00:29:00,585 --> 00:29:03,521
I'm not trying to start a war.

201
00:29:03,521 --> 00:29:06,423
The war has already begun.

202
00:29:06,457 --> 00:29:09,450
Then it's time to send them a message that we're here.

203
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:17,425
Here's the key./ Thank you.

204
00:29:17,468 --> 00:29:19,494
Let's go home.

205
00:29:19,503 --> 00:29:23,463
If your grandpa's still alive,
he'd be banging our heads when we're not finishing it.

206
00:29:25,409 --> 00:29:28,345
Tell you what. There's still plenty of time for that.

207
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:30,405
Got to get you to bed.

208
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,449
Got it.

209
00:29:41,325 --> 00:29:43,556
I've been looking for you./
Oh no. No. No.

210
00:29:43,561 --> 00:29:46,326
I need you to come with me to Atlantis./ Listen.

211
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:49,391
I'm going to tell you the same thing
I told that rusty starfish Vulko.

212
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,301
It's been nice meeting you, lady.

213
00:29:51,302 --> 00:29:52,531
No, thank you. I'm not interested.

214
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:56,405
You defeated Steppenwolf
and saved Atlantis.

215
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,306
That had nothing to do with Atlantis.

216
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:00,403
Your half brother, Raja Orm,
is about to declare war

217
00:30:00,444 --> 00:30:03,414
with the surface world.
Billions will die.

218
00:30:03,414 --> 00:30:05,474
Your people and mine.

219
00:30:05,483 --> 00:30:08,385
We must stop him.

220
00:30:12,423 --> 00:30:14,483
And how do you propose we do that?

221
00:30:14,492 --> 00:30:17,485
You re the first born son of
Queen Atlanna.

222
00:30:17,528 --> 00:30:20,327
The throne is yours by birthright.

223
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:22,493
The only way to stop this war

224
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,436
and save both worlds

225
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:28,530
is for you to take your rightful
place as King.

226
00:30:31,475 --> 00:30:35,344
You think if I just show up,
Orm will give up the throne?

227
00:30:35,379 --> 00:30:38,349
I'm the bastard son of a queen your people executed.

228
00:30:38,349 --> 00:30:41,547
Trust me. I'm no king.
I I agree.

229
00:30:41,585 --> 00:30:43,554
That's awesome. Go.

230
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:47,285
But, Vulko seems to believe in you for some reason.

231
00:30:47,425 --> 00:30:50,327
And that's why I'm here.
Vulko has learnt of the location of

232
00:30:50,327 --> 00:30:53,388
the lost trident of
Atlantis./ Ooh, Fairy tales.

233
00:30:53,431 --> 00:30:55,332
It's a myth./lt's not a myth.

234
00:30:55,332 --> 00:30:57,528
With the sacred trident,
people will listen to you.

235
00:30:57,568 --> 00:30:59,366
You can then claim your birthright

236
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:00,531
and dethrone Orm.

237
00:31:00,571 --> 00:31:04,303
My birthright? It died with my mother.

238
00:31:04,341 --> 00:31:06,367
But I'll promise you this.

239
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:08,402
If Orm attacks, I'll treat him the same way

240
00:31:08,412 --> 00:31:10,506
your people treated her.

241
00:31:10,548 --> 00:31:13,313
With no mercy.

242
00:32:10,508 --> 00:32:15,310
That submarine was barely operational. But it served its purpose.

243
00:32:15,346 --> 00:32:18,441
One of your kind intervened.

244
00:32:18,482 --> 00:32:23,443
He is not one of us./ He killed my father.

245
00:32:24,355 --> 00:32:26,483
Our transaction has ended.

246
00:32:30,361 --> 00:32:32,330
Keep the money.

247
00:32:32,496 --> 00:32:34,522
I want Aquaman.

248
00:33:44,602 --> 00:33:46,434
Dad!

249
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:52,535
Dad!

250
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:39,489
He;s not breathing./Move! Let me help.

251
00:35:15,492 --> 00:35:18,291
You know I don't even know your name.

252
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:24,425
You may call me Mera.

253
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:27,429
Thank you, Mera.

254
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,351
My god.

255
00:35:50,361 --> 00:35:52,489
This was Orm's doing.

256
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:56,366
The worst has yet to come.

257
00:36:03,507 --> 00:36:07,444
There's a flash flood…
/Building has been destroyed…

258
00:36:07,478 --> 00:36:10,607
….unprecedented sites from all over the world today…

259
00:36:10,614 --> 00:36:14,483
we're seeing warships and trash washed up
by massive waves.

260
00:36:16,387 --> 00:36:20,381
Garbage in multiple counties.

261
00:36:20,557 --> 00:36:23,527
Decades of pollution has been thrown back to land.

262
00:36:23,527 --> 00:36:26,326
Question,
was this a natural disaster

263
00:36:26,363 --> 00:36:27,422
or something else.

264
00:36:27,464 --> 00:36:29,330
No. This was no natural disaster.

265
00:36:29,366 --> 00:36:31,494
They threw out our garbage and warships.

266
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:33,562
This was our first contact with the
people of Atlantis.

267
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:37,405
Here you go again, with your insane Atlantean theory.

268
00:36:37,441 --> 00:36:39,376
You have absolutely no proof of this.

269
00:36:39,376 --> 00:36:40,400
Open your eyes.

270
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:42,277
We already have an Atlantean
living among us

271
00:36:42,312 --> 00:36:43,541
and his name is Aquaman.

272
00:36:51,422 --> 00:36:52,583
What is it?

273
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:56,390
This is the exact spot that Vulko gave me
my first formal lesson.

274
00:36:57,361 --> 00:37:00,388
You have to forgot all the teachings of the surface world.

275
00:37:00,431 --> 00:37:05,369
Go deeper, to uncover your Atlantean instinct.

276
00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:06,564
But I already know how to swim.

277
00:37:07,438 --> 00:37:09,430
Not even close.

278
00:37:12,543 --> 00:37:18,505
So, we're clear.

279
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,420
Help you stop this war, then I'm done.
Maybe that's for the best.

280
00:37:41,472 --> 00:37:45,568
The ocean is more than our life soul.
It's who we are.

281
00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:48,443
Wait. You can talk underwater?

282
00:37:48,445 --> 00:37:51,381
Hey, I can talk underwater too!

283
00:37:51,381 --> 00:37:52,508
This is awesome!

284
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:56,486
No. We can do more than just talk.

285
00:38:02,593 --> 00:38:07,554
Being an Atlantean means being more than just able to breathe in water.

286
00:38:07,598 --> 00:38:12,536
Your body is equipped to survive the extreme cold, and pressure.

287
00:38:12,536 --> 00:38:16,371
And your eyes adjust to see in the dark.

288
00:38:39,363 --> 00:38:41,355
This is awesome!

289
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:11,556
SO Vulko, when can I meet my mother?

290
00:39:13,363 --> 00:39:16,424
Soon, my young prince.

291
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:21,428
When you're ready, I will take you to
Atlantis to meet the Queen.

292
00:39:31,348 --> 00:39:33,317
I hid my ship in here.

293
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:36,453
Listen. I'm not getting in that thing.

294
00:39:36,486 --> 00:39:38,455
Well to get to where we're going,
you're gonna have to.

295
00:39:38,455 --> 00:39:42,415
Your fish ship has been marinated in chump butter. I might come out like small bud.

296
00:39:42,459 --> 00:39:44,428
That's be an improvement.

297
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:50,525
Yup.

298
00:41:47,303 --> 00:41:50,171
Welcome home.

299
00:42:37,386 --> 00:42:42,324
There is a safe house down in the old city. The high ones never ventured to the sea floor.

300
00:42:42,324 --> 00:42:44,350
We're here.

301
00:43:12,454 --> 00:43:14,480
What is this?

302
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:17,358
These are air pockets we used as
natural air precaution.

303
00:43:17,393 --> 00:43:19,419
Only the high ones can breathe on air.

304
00:43:19,428 --> 00:43:22,193
Plus, it keeps the animals out.

305
00:43:22,231 --> 00:43:24,257
They get kind of messy.

306
00:43:26,468 --> 00:43:29,233
Vulko. Here I am old man.

307
00:43:29,238 --> 00:43:32,299
After all these years,
you finally get what you wanted.

308
00:43:34,343 --> 00:43:38,337
Arthur, I wish it was under better circumstances.

309
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,440
I can't believe Orm attacked.

310
00:43:40,449 --> 00:43:44,318
It wasn't an attack.
Legally, he's not allowed to yet.

311
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,380
What he did to your surface warships

312
00:43:46,388 --> 00:43:49,187
was merely a warning./
What provoked him?

313
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:55,255
King Orm and your father were ambushed by the surface.
/The surface? I don't think so.

314
00:43:55,264 --> 00:43:58,428
I'd still think that's Atlantis fairytale./ I was there.

315
00:43:58,434 --> 00:44:01,268
A surface warship fired at us.

316
00:44:01,303 --> 00:44:04,239
Now, Xebel sides with Atlantis.

317
00:44:04,273 --> 00:44:08,472
Giving Orm a fleet big enough to force
the other two kingdoms to join him.

318
00:44:08,477 --> 00:44:13,245
If we're gonna prevent this war,
you must dethrone him now.

319
00:44:13,282 --> 00:44:15,376
How many times do I have to tell you,
I don;t want to be king.

320
00:44:18,017 --> 00:44:20,885
Once he's named Ocean Master,
that'll be too late.

321
00:44:20,887 --> 00:44:23,880
The power at his disposal will be
unlike anything you've ever seen.

322
00:44:23,923 --> 00:44:26,893
I'm from the surface. No one's
gonna take me seriously.

323
00:44:26,893 --> 00:44:28,020
Heck, I'd don't even know where to begin.

324
00:44:28,061 --> 00:44:30,997
By winning the hearts and minds of the people

325
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,864
by proving to them that you're worthy.

326
00:44:33,866 --> 00:44:35,027
By retrieving this.

327
00:44:41,908 --> 00:44:43,934
I already got one of those.

328
00:44:44,877 --> 00:44:47,073
Not like this one you don't.

329
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,016
This is the lost Trident of Atlantis.

330
00:44:50,049 --> 00:44:52,814
Oh, I know the story./
It's more than a story.

331
00:44:52,852 --> 00:44:54,047
It's real.

332
00:44:54,988 --> 00:44:59,084
It was forged by the greatest weapon masters
in history.

333
00:45:00,026 --> 00:45:02,962
Crafted from Poseidon's steel.

334
00:45:02,962 --> 00:45:06,899
For King Atlan,
the first ruler of Atlantis.

335
00:45:08,835 --> 00:45:09,996
Legend says, the Trident was build with the power

336
00:45:10,003 --> 00:45:12,871
to command the sea.

337
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,864
So what happened to it?

338
00:45:14,874 --> 00:45:18,038
To know that, is to go back to the time before
the Great Fall.

339
00:45:18,945 --> 00:45:22,040
When King Atlan ruler over all that was,

340
00:45:23,082 --> 00:45:25,984
the Kingdoms of Atlantis were one.

341
00:45:28,855 --> 00:45:33,919
It was a time of great prosperity and
technological advancement.

342
00:45:34,927 --> 00:45:37,897
We've unlocked the secret to unlimited energy

343
00:45:37,897 --> 00:45:41,800
when the rest of the world still thought
the earth was flat.

344
00:45:43,002 --> 00:45:46,905
But we became too ambitious,

345
00:45:46,906 --> 00:45:49,034
too hungry for power.

346
00:46:05,858 --> 00:46:09,818
…Swallowed us and Atlantis sank.

347
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:16,030
But the very power that collapsed our civilisation also paved the way to our future.

348
00:46:16,035 --> 00:46:20,871
It gave us ability to breathe underwater.

349
00:46:20,907 --> 00:46:23,001
And so, we evolved.

350
00:46:23,876 --> 00:46:25,037
Others regressed.

351
00:46:25,078 --> 00:46:27,843
Became savage.

352
00:46:28,047 --> 00:46:33,816
And the king lived out the remainder of
his days in self imposed exile.

353
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:37,052
Neither he, nor the Trident were ever seen again.

354
00:46:38,024 --> 00:46:42,792
One of our archeological team uncovered this
a few months ago.

355
00:46:42,829 --> 00:46:46,857
It's an ancient recording dating back to the first dynasty.

356
00:46:46,866 --> 00:46:50,030
I believe it contained Atlan's final message
to it's people

357
00:46:50,069 --> 00:46:54,905
and the whereabouts of the sacred Trident./
So what does it say?

358
00:46:54,907 --> 00:46:55,966
We don't know.

359
00:46:56,008 --> 00:46:57,874
The technology's too old.

360
00:46:57,877 --> 00:47:00,904
The cylinder bears the marking of the
Deserter Kingdom.

361
00:47:00,913 --> 00:47:03,974
You must take it there to retrieve the message.

362
00:47:04,016 --> 00:47:08,078
The clue to Atlan's final resting
place is inside this.

363
00:47:26,038 --> 00:47:28,974
You're under arrest for illegal entry./Go.

364
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:32,970
You must be seen here.

365
00:48:28,968 --> 00:48:31,836
I don't suppose you want to talk about this, do you?

366
00:48:35,875 --> 00:48:36,968
Neither do I.

367
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:21,887
In the name of His Highness King Orm,
I place you under arrest.

368
00:49:42,008 --> 00:49:44,807
Welcome to Atlantis,

369
00:49:45,978 --> 00:49:47,970
Brother.

370
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:53,943
I can't believe you're finally here.

371
00:49:54,987 --> 00:49:57,923
I've heard so many stories about you.

372
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:09,962
All these years, I'm ashamed of my mother's surface brother.

373
00:50:09,969 --> 00:50:17,001
Ashamed of the fact that I have a half breed brother I want to run my Trident through.

374
00:50:17,043 --> 00:50:20,912
But now that you're finally here before me,

375
00:50:20,946 --> 00:50:22,972
I must admit…

376
00:50:29,021 --> 00:50:31,013
I'm conflicted.

377
00:50:31,023 --> 00:50:35,961
You want conflict, will you take these chains off little brother?

378
00:50:35,995 --> 00:50:38,863
And we'll see what we can run through.

379
00:50:40,866 --> 00:50:44,860
Yes. I see you brought our mothers weapon.

380
00:50:44,904 --> 00:50:48,932
Is that why you've come here after all this time?

381
00:50:48,974 --> 00:50:51,000
To kill me?

382
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:53,878
I came here to stop a maniac from destroying my world.

383
00:50:53,879 --> 00:50:55,814
I see.

384
00:50:55,815 --> 00:51:00,844
And how do you plan to stop the atrocities by the surface to commit

385
00:51:00,986 --> 00:51:06,926
over centuries polluted our waters

386
00:51:06,926 --> 00:51:09,862
and poisoned our children.

387
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:12,991
Now the skies are burning our oceans

388
00:51:14,967 --> 00:51:18,961
You've come all this way to take side against your own people?

389
00:51:19,004 --> 00:51:21,064
There are no sides I don't want this.

390
00:51:21,073 --> 00:51:23,975
You've clearly chosen a side to come here to challenge the throne

391
00:51:24,009 --> 00:51:26,843
Thats to stop your war.

392
00:51:28,047 --> 00:51:30,949
Are you invoking the combat of the Kings?

393
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:34,045
Call it whatever you want. I call it an ass whooping.

394
00:51:34,887 --> 00:51:37,857
Well then perhaps that's how we'll proceed

395
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:38,949
Your majesty!/Orm please.

396
00:51:38,991 --> 00:51:40,823
Don't you see?

397
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:45,059
If I defeat the first born son of Atlanna in front of everyone.

398
00:51:45,064 --> 00:51:48,091
Then all seven kingdoms will have to concede that

399
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,797
I, am the one true king.

400
00:51:50,803 --> 00:51:54,001
Your majesty. There is no victory in feeding the ignorant.

401
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:56,907
Your brother is clearly an imbecile.

402
00:51:56,909 --> 00:52:00,073
Your Highness. He doesn't know our ways.

403
00:52:00,112 --> 00:52:02,877
Then he'll about to get an education.

404
00:52:03,849 --> 00:52:07,013
Are you officially challenging me?/
Hell yes, I'll challenge you.

405
00:52:07,052 --> 00:52:09,817
And when I win, if you win.

406
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:12,950
I will cease all immediate action.
The war is over.

407
00:52:12,992 --> 00:52:15,985
But if I win,

408
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:18,855
you're over.

409
00:52:18,864 --> 00:52:21,925
Good./So be it.

410
00:52:21,967 --> 00:52:23,028
Challenge has been made,
and I accept.

411
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:27,140
Prepare him for the ring of fire!

412
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,166
Wait. What?

413
00:52:48,929 --> 00:52:52,127
How can you be so foolish to let Orm bait you into a fight?

414
00:52:52,132 --> 00:52:54,897
It seems to me that'll solve all our problems.

415
00:52:54,935 --> 00:52:57,928
I beat him in battle. War's over.
I'm getting home.

416
00:52:57,938 --> 00:52:59,964
You're a formidable fighter on land.

417
00:53:00,006 --> 00:53:02,066
But here, you're out of your element literally.

418
00:53:02,075 --> 00:53:05,045
Orm has spent his entire life underwater.

419
00:53:05,045 --> 00:53:07,913
Training to be a warrior. Training to be the best.

420
00:53:08,048 --> 00:53:10,176
You taught me how to fight.

421
00:53:10,183 --> 00:53:12,948
Let's see if you remember anything

422
00:53:16,089 --> 00:53:19,116
What's with the big fork?
/That's a Trident.

423
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:20,957
Now defend!

424
00:53:54,127 --> 00:53:58,087
The hell is this?/I'll teach you the
movement to master the Trident.

425
00:54:08,074 --> 00:54:09,167
It;s not fair.

426
00:54:09,209 --> 00:54:11,974
This thing is too big. Why can't I use a sword?

427
00:54:11,978 --> 00:54:13,139
That's your mother's Trident.

428
00:54:13,146 --> 00:54:16,014
A traditional weapon of royalty.

429
00:54:16,016 --> 00:54:18,918
You'll never be a King until you mastered it.

430
00:54:18,952 --> 00:54:20,944
Why she never come to see me, ha?

431
00:54:20,954 --> 00:54:24,152
I told you, when you're ready…/
Stop lying to me!

432
00:54:24,157 --> 00:54:27,025
I've done everything you've asked.

433
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:29,962
And everytime I passed a
test, you make another one.

434
00:54:29,963 --> 00:54:31,090
When am I ever gonna be good enough?

435
00:54:35,168 --> 00:54:37,933
Did she not love me?

436
00:54:37,937 --> 00:54:40,998
Your mother loved you more than
anything in the world.

437
00:54:41,007 --> 00:54:44,136
But she had to return to Atlantis
to keep you safe.

438
00:54:44,978 --> 00:54:48,107
Her marriage to
King Orvax was arranged a long time ago

439
00:54:48,148 --> 00:54:51,983
so she had to marry him and bear him

440
00:54:51,985 --> 00:54:53,954
a son, Prince Orm.

441
00:54:53,987 --> 00:54:55,979
But Orvax eventually found out about you,

442
00:54:55,989 --> 00:55:03,089
He became overwhelmed with jealousy and
sacrificed her to the creatures of the Trench

443
00:55:05,131 --> 00:55:07,999
Are you saying they executed her

444
00:55:09,135 --> 00:55:11,934
because she had me?

445
00:55:25,085 --> 00:55:28,954
I remember, everything.

446
00:55:31,991 --> 00:55:36,952
I have something for you.
It belonged to my mother.

447
00:55:38,198 --> 00:55:46,072
Tell me, do you think she would enjoy
watching her sons murder each other?

448
00:55:46,106 --> 00:55:51,010
I understand your fear, your reluctance, Mera.

449
00:55:51,044 --> 00:55:52,945
I surely do.

450
00:55:52,979 --> 00:55:54,914
I don't want war.

451
00:55:54,914 --> 00:55:57,179
Don't patronise me. I know you.

452
00:55:57,217 --> 00:56:01,052
What you're doing is against every advise your mother gave us when we were children.

453
00:56:01,054 --> 00:56:05,958
If she were her…/ But she's not here, is she.

454
00:56:05,992 --> 00:56:09,121
What my mother taught us was treason.

455
00:56:09,129 --> 00:56:12,031
Don't follow her ways.

456
00:56:12,631 --> 00:56:15,692
Alright, the feared ring of fire, huh?

457
00:56:15,735 --> 00:56:19,695
How it works…
Let's keep your ass right here.

458
00:56:22,641 --> 00:56:28,581
Vulko, will you escort my betrothed to the royal box.

459
00:56:38,758 --> 00:56:41,626
Let's go, Lady Mera.

460
00:56:46,699 --> 00:56:51,501
Down here we have a legend called Karathen.

461
00:56:51,537 --> 00:56:55,565
An ancient sea monster so powerful that King Atlan himself feared it.

462
00:56:55,708 --> 00:57:00,510
So he imprisoned it./
In the depths of the ocean.

463
00:57:00,546 --> 00:57:04,711
And it that abyss, the creature buys time waiting to rise again.

464
00:57:04,717 --> 00:57:07,619
Atlantis has been lying and wait.

465
00:57:08,654 --> 00:57:10,714
And now the beast has awaken.

466
00:57:16,629 --> 00:57:19,497
You know, there was a time

467
00:57:19,532 --> 00:57:22,661
when I wanted to meet you more than anything.

468
00:57:22,701 --> 00:57:25,694
To get to know my little brother.

469
00:57:25,704 --> 00:57:28,572
To let him know that he wasn't alone.

470
00:57:28,574 --> 00:57:30,600
Then we run into together.

471
00:57:32,711 --> 00:57:36,512
For me I know what a dick you turned out to be.

472
00:57:38,651 --> 00:57:41,553
You're the reason our mother was executed.

473
00:57:42,555 --> 00:57:45,525
And I've hated you since the beginning

474
00:57:47,526 --> 00:57:50,690
But I do not want to kill you, Arthur.

475
00:57:50,696 --> 00:57:54,565
I'm going to give you one chance.

476
00:57:56,034 --> 00:58:01,234
Go home. Do not ever come back to Atlantis.

477
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:04,107
You re not going to win it.

478
00:58:04,109 --> 00:58:08,012
The war is coming to the surface,
whether you like it or not.

479
00:58:08,046 --> 00:58:11,983
And I'm bringing the wrath of the seven seas with me.

480
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:15,952
You know I can't let that happen.

481
00:58:15,987 --> 00:58:17,979
I know.

482
00:58:20,925 --> 00:58:22,894
What the hell is that?

483
00:58:24,095 --> 00:58:26,826
The ring of fire.

484
00:58:47,051 --> 00:58:49,020
Shit.

485
00:58:50,054 --> 00:58:55,789
People of Atlantis, hear me. My brother has come from the surface

486
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:57,056
to challenge me for the throne!

487
00:58:58,062 --> 00:59:01,931
Let us settle this in the ancient way.

488
00:59:01,933 --> 00:59:05,961
By bloodshed to the gods…

489
00:59:41,005 --> 00:59:42,871
Never thought I'd see the day when my own father

490
00:59:42,874 --> 00:59:44,968
would bow to the King of Atlantis.

491
00:59:44,976 --> 00:59:47,036
The surface dweller drew first blood.

492
00:59:47,078 --> 00:59:50,845
What would you have us do? Beg them for mercy?

493
00:59:50,848 --> 00:59:52,840
I detest the surface as much as you do.

494
00:59:52,884 --> 00:59:56,048
But don't you find the timing of all of this a bit convenient?

495
00:59:59,056 --> 01:00:03,892
You wouldn't be that gullible, would you?

496
01:00:05,897 --> 01:00:07,957
You want this war too, don't you?

497
01:00:07,999 --> 01:00:10,867
It's past time the surface dweller earn their place in the world.

498
01:00:10,868 --> 01:00:13,963
If this is what must be done, then so be it.

499
01:00:19,877 --> 01:00:24,975
That's my mother's Trident, powerful but flawed like her.

500
01:00:25,016 --> 01:00:27,850
I wield my father's.

501
01:00:27,852 --> 01:00:30,822
And it has never known defeat!

502
01:01:18,869 --> 01:01:21,031
I promised Atlanna I'll protect him.

503
01:01:28,012 --> 01:01:32,814
This isn't a competition.
It's an execution.

504
01:03:27,998 --> 01:03:32,902
I am the one true king!

505
01:04:15,045 --> 01:04:18,106
You waiting for an invitation? Get in!

506
01:04:27,925 --> 01:04:30,895
Mera!

507
01:04:33,998 --> 01:04:37,958
So what's the plan?/The plan was to recover
Atlan's Trident. Then challenge Orm.

508
01:04:38,002 --> 01:04:40,904
Ok. So we do things not in order.
Shit happens.

509
01:04:45,976 --> 01:04:49,811
Heads up. We got a bogey on our six./
What does that even mean?

510
01:04:49,847 --> 01:04:51,873
Bad guys behind us./ We just did that.

511
01:04:51,882 --> 01:04:53,043
Bad guys behind us.

512
01:06:00,918 --> 01:06:03,854
Woah, woah, wait. You said we shouldn't go over these walls/
I did.

513
01:06:03,854 --> 01:06:05,914
We shouldn't hide these things./
I did! Now shut up!

514
01:06:39,823 --> 01:06:42,884
We are not dead yet!

515
01:06:43,927 --> 01:06:46,021
Jump!

516
01:06:52,069 --> 01:06:54,834
Here, hold this.

517
01:06:55,973 --> 01:06:58,841
What are you doing?/
We're gonna follow Pinnochio.

518
01:06:58,876 --> 01:07:01,072
Who?/ Never mind, come here. Get in. Come on.

519
01:07:03,113 --> 01:07:06,049
Great. So we are getting eaten.

520
01:07:27,905 --> 01:07:31,069
How'd you even doing this anyway?/ I don't know.

521
01:07:31,075 --> 01:07:36,946
I can hear them sometimes. They can hear me/
Right. We're both is some animal stomach.

522
01:07:36,947 --> 01:07:38,006
Hey, I just saved your life.

523
01:07:38,048 --> 01:07:39,812
I saved yours first.

524
01:07:43,987 --> 01:07:48,823
He said, coast is clear.
So, where to now?

525
01:07:49,827 --> 01:07:52,888
To the ocean of sand, your people called the Sahara.

526
01:07:53,997 --> 01:07:55,829
Right.

527
01:08:22,926 --> 01:08:23,916
Thanks for the ride buddy.

528
01:08:27,965 --> 01:08:29,866
Are you ok?

529
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,936
I've never been so high up.

530
01:08:33,871 --> 01:08:36,033
We're so far from home.

531
01:08:37,007 --> 01:08:39,067
At least you have a home.

532
01:08:39,076 --> 01:08:42,877
Not anymore. I can never go back.

533
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:45,975
I betrayed everything when I saved you at the Coliseum.

534
01:08:49,953 --> 01:08:53,048
Kalau begitu, I have to take you back.

535
01:08:53,090 --> 01:08:56,060
Atlantis is many wonderful things.

536
01:08:56,093 --> 01:08:59,063
But forgiving does not./
But you're royalty.

537
01:08:59,096 --> 01:09:01,031
So is your mother.

538
01:09:01,832 --> 01:09:04,859
If I go back now, I would be sacrificed
for the Trench.

539
01:09:04,868 --> 01:09:07,838
Even my own father wouldn't take me back.

540
01:09:11,041 --> 01:09:16,036
Look on the bright side. You don't have to marry someone you're obligated.

541
01:09:16,046 --> 01:09:18,880
Obligation isn't love.

542
01:09:18,916 --> 01:09:21,943
This is my family and my nation.

543
01:09:21,952 --> 01:09:24,046
And I've turned my back on both.

544
01:09:26,023 --> 01:09:29,050
Sometimes we have to do what's right,

545
01:09:29,059 --> 01:09:32,996
even if your heart aches against it.

546
01:09:47,811 --> 01:09:50,872
Your Highness.

547
01:09:51,849 --> 01:09:53,909
The tracking puts Princess Mera here.

548
01:09:54,017 --> 01:09:56,043
In the desert.

549
01:09:56,086 --> 01:10:00,820
You aid she was dead./Apparently not.

550
01:10:01,959 --> 01:10:04,861
Does your brother still lives as well?/
Not for long.

551
01:10:04,862 --> 01:10:07,923
Captain Murk, assemble the strike force immediately./
No!

552
01:10:07,931 --> 01:10:11,060
Mira is to be arrested and she returned to me.

553
01:10:11,068 --> 01:10:12,832
She betrayed the throne…

554
01:10:12,836 --> 01:10:14,828
She's the daughter of Xebel.

555
01:10:14,872 --> 01:10:18,775
If any harm befalls her, our coalition is over.

556
01:10:18,809 --> 01:10:23,042
Your Highness, we are now entering the waters of the Fisherman Kingdom.

557
01:10:23,046 --> 01:10:29,850
Securing the alliance of the other two kingdoms should be our immediate concern.

558
01:10:32,089 --> 01:10:34,923
My vizier is correct.

559
01:10:35,826 --> 01:10:37,852
As usual.

560
01:10:38,929 --> 01:10:45,859
Arrest them and bring back King Nereus's
daughter unharmed.

561
01:11:08,058 --> 01:11:09,219
We're here.

562
01:11:11,194 --> 01:11:14,096
Hey, is there anything nearby?

563
01:11:14,097 --> 01:11:17,067
Nothing but deserts for hundreds of… mate./Nothing but deserts…

564
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,068
He's wrong!

565
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:21,229
Mera, no!

566
01:11:24,141 --> 01:11:26,167
She just jumped without a parachute.

567
01:11:26,209 --> 01:11:29,145
Redhead. You gotta love 'em.

568
01:11:58,208 --> 01:12:00,200
You're crazier than I thought.

569
01:12:03,013 --> 01:12:04,072
This way.

570
01:12:25,268 --> 01:12:29,205
You were defeated the last time because your surface weapons failed you.

571
01:12:29,239 --> 01:12:31,265
Ours will not.

572
01:12:34,144 --> 01:12:38,138
It's prototype armour for the next generation
Atlantean soldier.

573
01:12:38,315 --> 01:12:42,047
Revenge is something we Atlantean understand.

574
01:12:42,052 --> 01:12:45,181
You will lead my finest commandoes as your personal army,

575
01:12:45,188 --> 01:12:47,248
to hunt the half breed abomination.

576
01:12:47,290 --> 01:12:50,158
I can't touch them but you can.

577
01:12:50,193 --> 01:12:52,094
He's fled to your world.

578
01:12:52,095 --> 01:12:54,087
Kill him and the woman he's with

579
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:55,257
and you will be rewarded.

580
01:12:55,298 --> 01:12:58,132
Killing him is my reward.

581
01:13:01,204 --> 01:13:05,005
The crown jewel is too experimental.

582
01:13:05,175 --> 01:13:08,202
Converge water into beams of energised plasma.

583
01:14:21,217 --> 01:14:24,153
Hmm, I think we're gonna need a bigger helmet.

584
01:14:23,554 --> 01:14:28,492
One of the tribes of Atlantis
broke off and settled here when the region was still an inland sea.

585
01:14:28,525 --> 01:14:31,461
When the water dried up, they perished along with it.

586
01:14:31,462 --> 01:14:33,430
Perished? Yeah that's great.

587
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:35,490
We're getting close now./ Yeah, close to what?

588
01:14:35,499 --> 01:14:37,559
Dying of thirst?/I'm close to punching your face.

589
01:14:37,601 --> 01:14:40,469
A fight club? I didn't know you knew
how things work up here.

590
01:14:40,471 --> 01:14:42,406
Why don;t you look around, we are lost.

591
01:14:42,439 --> 01:14:45,432
You see that over there. What is that? Na-da.

592
01:14:45,442 --> 01:14:46,466
This place's a wasteland.

593
01:14:46,610 --> 01:14:49,444
You're the one who call this
'wasteland' a home.

594
01:14:49,480 --> 01:14:50,675
This isn't my home.

595
01:14:50,714 --> 01:14:53,411
The whole shore doesn't look like this.

596
01:14:53,417 --> 01:14:54,544
Oh, no. Of course not.

597
01:14:54,585 --> 01:14:58,420
You also got disgusting cities with sewers
emptying out into our ocean

598
01:14:58,455 --> 01:14:59,684
and whole mountains made out of thrash.

599
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:03,650
You got great factories, and…

600
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,629
Ok, ok, ok. Point taken. Listen.

601
01:15:05,662 --> 01:15:08,530
Yeah, we got some idiots running the show. But
there are good things too right.

602
01:15:08,532 --> 01:15:10,524
We got green forest, big mountains,

603
01:15:10,534 --> 01:15:11,502
and beautiful lakes.

604
01:15:11,535 --> 01:15:15,438
You'd love them. There are like baby oceans./ Are you trying to provoke me?

605
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:17,635
I'm just trying to say don't judge a place before you even see it.

606
01:15:17,641 --> 01:15:19,667
You judged Atlantis on far less.

607
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:26,548
No, no, no. Will you just stop it with that.

608
01:15:26,583 --> 01:15:27,642
No.

609
01:15:27,651 --> 01:15:30,644
Your stupid Atlantean GPS just told you to
jump out of an airplane

610
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:33,555
over the middle of the desert.
And now we are stranded.

611
01:15:36,627 --> 01:15:39,563
If you are the next true king we're doomed.

612
01:16:07,424 --> 01:16:08,551
That was awesome.

613
01:16:14,665 --> 01:16:17,430
Look what I found.

614
01:16:17,434 --> 01:16:20,404
What you found?/Yeah.

615
01:16:30,414 --> 01:16:31,677
Check this place out.

616
01:16:32,483 --> 01:16:35,453
This is badass!

617
01:16:35,652 --> 01:16:41,489
This is the hall of armoury where the legend
says where Atlann's Trident was forged.

618
01:16:43,427 --> 01:16:45,487
I don't think they are a legend anymore.

619
01:16:51,468 --> 01:16:53,596
I was right.

620
01:16:55,472 --> 01:16:57,464
It's real.

621
01:17:35,646 --> 01:17:37,581
Nothing.

622
01:17:37,581 --> 01:17:39,675
Of course it's not working.
It's been sitting here

623
01:17:39,716 --> 01:17:42,447
collecting dust since before
the Sahara was a desert.

624
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:49,491
Man./Since before the Sahara
was a desert.

625
01:17:49,493 --> 01:17:51,553
Thank you for repeating what I just said.

626
01:17:51,595 --> 01:17:53,587
It's completely dried out.

627
01:17:55,566 --> 01:17:58,559
You do the best thinking when you're not thinking at all.

628
01:17:58,569 --> 01:18:00,595
Now hold still.

629
01:18:00,604 --> 01:18:03,506
What are you doing?/ We need water.

630
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:07,668
You are the closest source. Now hold still.

631
01:18:45,649 --> 01:18:47,584
We could've just peed on it.

632
01:18:57,594 --> 01:18:59,495
King Atlann.

633
01:19:01,498 --> 01:19:06,436
In this Trident resides the power of Atlantis.

634
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:10,601
In the wrong hands, it would bring destruction.

635
01:19:10,607 --> 01:19:14,544
In the hands of the true heir,
it will unite all our

636
01:19:14,578 --> 01:19:16,570
kingdoms above and below.

637
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:21,450
If you seek my power,
you must prove your worth.

638
01:19:21,485 --> 01:19:25,388
Journey beyond the edge of the world to the hidden sea.

639
01:19:25,422 --> 01:19:28,483
Look inside the bottle for the chartered path.

640
01:19:28,492 --> 01:19:31,485
Only in the hands of the true king,

641
01:19:31,528 --> 01:19:34,521
can he truly see.

642
01:19:49,579 --> 01:19:51,673
We can't let Orm find this.

643
01:19:53,617 --> 01:19:55,483
Hey, wait! No…

644
01:19:56,486 --> 01:19:57,579
What?

645
01:19:57,587 --> 01:19:59,556
Shouldn't we have written it down first?

646
01:19:59,589 --> 01:20:02,525
I memorised it. Didn't you?

647
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,426
Oh, yeah.

648
01:20:05,662 --> 01:20:07,631
What did it just said?

649
01:20:09,599 --> 01:20:12,467
Something something Trident.

650
01:20:34,691 --> 01:20:37,422
It's our next stop.

651
01:22:11,454 --> 01:22:13,616
I'm starting to think you actually like the surface dwellers.

652
01:22:13,623 --> 01:22:16,559
It'd be wrong to judge a place I've never seen before.

653
01:22:18,461 --> 01:22:21,488
I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.

654
01:22:41,518 --> 01:22:43,680
Well, apparently she's right up on the
hill in the old castle.

655
01:22:43,687 --> 01:22:46,623
I've just learnt something very interesting.

656
01:22:47,524 --> 01:22:49,390
Pinocchio.

657
01:22:49,526 --> 01:22:52,553
You risk our lives on something you read
on a children's book?

658
01:22:53,597 --> 01:22:57,398
Wait it's a book? How about that.

659
01:22:57,667 --> 01:23:01,434
We have to go.

660
01:23:05,608 --> 01:23:09,636
King Nereus, I had hoped that our people had evolved

661
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:12,672
that war with the surface is inevitable.

662
01:23:12,716 --> 01:23:18,519
It is the position of the Fishermen that
when the time comes to make ourselves known

663
01:23:18,521 --> 01:23:19,580
to the lands men.

664
01:23:19,589 --> 01:23:21,524
It shall be to educate them,

665
01:23:21,691 --> 01:23:23,660
not destroy them.

666
01:23:23,793 --> 01:23:27,628
I admire your lofty aspirations King…

667
01:23:30,633 --> 01:23:35,697
But I suspect they are a cloud of ink hiding the
heart of coward

668
01:23:35,705 --> 01:23:37,571
How dare you!

669
01:23:39,676 --> 01:23:42,669
Please, I implore you.

670
01:23:42,679 --> 01:23:46,707
Your kingdom's bloated philosophers and flaccid moments

671
01:23:46,716 --> 01:23:50,517
whose waters have gone stagnant and it sickens me.

672
01:23:58,661 --> 01:23:59,685
My king!

673
01:23:59,729 --> 01:24:01,561
The king is dead.

674
01:24:01,765 --> 01:24:04,564
Long live the heir.

675
01:24:05,635 --> 01:24:10,699
Princess. Prepare your armies, Your Highness.

676
01:24:10,707 --> 01:24:14,508
We move against the Brine kingdom at once.

677
01:24:22,552 --> 01:24:23,747
What are the records saying again?

678
01:24:23,787 --> 01:24:27,690
Journey beyond the edge of the world to the hidden sea.

679
01:24:27,690 --> 01:24:29,682
Look into the bottle for the chartered path.

680
01:24:29,726 --> 01:24:31,718
Only in the hands of the true king,

681
01:24:31,728 --> 01:24:33,697
can he truly see.

682
01:24:35,665 --> 01:24:38,726
Look into the bottle for the chartered path.

683
01:24:42,806 --> 01:24:46,766
Oh man./What?

684
01:24:52,715 --> 01:24:55,583
But how do you know where to point it…/Let me see.

685
01:24:55,585 --> 01:24:56,678
What's the last line?

686
01:24:56,719 --> 01:24:59,484
Only in the hands of the true king,

687
01:24:59,522 --> 01:25:00,649
can he truly see.

688
01:25:05,662 --> 01:25:07,756
He was a great General, but he wasn't a king.

689
01:25:12,702 --> 01:25:16,662
How do you know all this stuff?/My pops.
He make sure I know my history.

690
01:25:16,706 --> 01:25:21,770
None of these guys are kings, except this guy.

691
01:25:21,778 --> 01:25:24,680
Romulos, first king of Rome.

692
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:28,677
Only in the hands of the true king,

693
01:25:28,718 --> 01:25:30,619
can he truly see.

694
01:25:39,696 --> 01:25:43,690
There it is. That's where we're heading./
What? Let me see.

695
01:25:50,573 --> 01:25:52,667
Not bad, for an imbecile huh?

696
01:25:53,776 --> 01:25:56,575
Not bad at all.

697
01:30:58,552 --> 01:31:00,384
Go!

698
01:31:10,564 --> 01:31:14,467
I'll show you the same mercy you showed my father.

699
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:17,438
And cut you like the fish you are.

700
01:33:12,419 --> 01:33:14,479
Arthur!

701
01:33:17,391 --> 01:33:21,419
Mera. They are tracking you./ What?

702
01:33:21,462 --> 01:33:24,330
They are tracking you.

703
01:33:33,541 --> 01:33:37,535
Arthur! Stay with me.

704
01:33:37,545 --> 01:33:40,413
Arthur, wake up.

705
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:34,392
Did you steal a boat?

706
01:34:34,401 --> 01:34:37,371
Are the boats at the marina not for public use?

707
01:34:37,371 --> 01:34:40,535
No. Those belong to people.

708
01:34:43,544 --> 01:34:47,345
Those are Orm's elite commandoes.
The one who lead them

709
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:52,480
isn't Atlantean. I've never seen him before./
Yeah, I have.

710
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:56,288
He and his father were pirates.

711
01:34:56,323 --> 01:34:59,521
He blames me for his father's death.

712
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:04,555
He pick a dangerous line of trade.
It's not your fault.

713
01:35:04,565 --> 01:35:08,366
It's not how I feels.

714
01:35:08,402 --> 01:35:11,429
It was up to me, I let him die,

715
01:35:12,506 --> 01:35:15,442
I could save him but I didn't.

716
01:35:15,442 --> 01:35:21,473
I know I made an enemy. And he could hurt you,
knowing it's my fault.

717
01:35:22,583 --> 01:35:24,575
Well he's behind us now.

718
01:35:26,453 --> 01:35:29,514
It's what lies ahead that should concerns us.

719
01:35:30,457 --> 01:35:34,417
The chartered path leads to the kingdom of the Trench.

720
01:35:35,529 --> 01:35:38,499
That's the same creatures that killed my mother.

721
01:35:38,532 --> 01:35:42,333
Yes. She was taken there and sacrificed to them.

722
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:44,430
It has become a place of death.

723
01:35:44,471 --> 01:35:47,373
I know next to nothing about what's down there.

724
01:35:50,477 --> 01:35:52,469
We should turn back.

725
01:35:52,613 --> 01:35:55,549
We can still warn the surface, try to
prepare them for what's coming.

726
01:35:55,549 --> 01:35:58,576
Turn back? /Look. I learn from a young age

727
01:35:58,585 --> 01:36:01,316
about not to show weakness.

728
01:36:01,355 --> 01:36:04,325
Hey, it's not a problem with my anger and my fist.

729
01:36:04,325 --> 01:36:07,295
I'm a blunt instrument and I'm damn good at it.

730
01:36:07,328 --> 01:36:10,389
I've done nothing.
Getting my ass kicked

731
01:36:10,397 --> 01:36:11,558
this whole trip.

732
01:36:11,565 --> 01:36:15,366
I'm no leader. I'm not a king.

733
01:36:15,402 --> 01:36:17,530
I do not work or play well with others.

734
01:36:18,372 --> 01:36:20,398
And I”m not going to let you die

735
01:36:20,407 --> 01:36:22,535
trying to turn me into something I'm not.

736
01:36:23,376 --> 01:36:28,110
You think you're unworthy to lead because
we're from two different worlds.

737
01:36:28,248 --> 01:36:32,208
But that is exactly why you are worthy.

738
01:36:32,218 --> 01:36:36,087
You are the bridge between land and sea.

739
01:36:36,122 --> 01:36:38,284
I can see that now.

740
01:36:38,324 --> 01:36:44,230
The only question is, can you?

741
01:36:59,045 --> 01:37:03,073
The tracking on Lady Mera is still
dark, Your Highness.

742
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:07,987
Vulko, my trusted vizier.

743
01:37:08,021 --> 01:37:11,856
You stood by the throne since my father.

744
01:37:13,059 --> 01:37:16,894
Have you any advise for me since this war begins

745
01:37:16,897 --> 01:37:19,765
I've already given it, my king.

746
01:37:19,799 --> 01:37:22,997
That I will stand by your decision as always.

747
01:37:23,036 --> 01:37:26,029
My decision…

748
01:37:26,039 --> 01:37:29,976
To protect it…

749
01:37:30,877 --> 01:37:33,039
While you betray it.

750
01:37:33,847 --> 01:37:37,784
You think I do not know of your treachery.

751
01:37:37,817 --> 01:37:42,084
That you ever made loyal to my mother's bastard son.

752
01:37:42,923 --> 01:37:48,794
That you have spent years training him to take the throne from me.

753
01:37:50,864 --> 01:37:52,992
Do not deny it.

754
01:37:55,035 --> 01:37:58,938
I do not./Why?

755
01:37:59,806 --> 01:38:02,071
I am a pure blood.

756
01:38:02,075 --> 01:38:06,035
I have devoted my life to Atlantis.

757
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:07,980
You wanted nothing to do with it.

758
01:38:08,014 --> 01:38:09,846
You swore to serve the throne.

759
01:38:09,849 --> 01:38:10,873
I do serve it.

760
01:38:10,917 --> 01:38:12,943
Arthur may only be half Atlantean,

761
01:38:12,953 --> 01:38:17,857
but he is already twice the king you'll ever be.

762
01:38:23,096 --> 01:38:24,962
Take him.

763
01:38:25,865 --> 01:38:29,097
But make sure he has a view.

764
01:40:09,610 --> 01:40:13,411
What the hell are these things?/The Trench!
We're here!

765
01:40:14,715 --> 01:40:17,651
There's too many of them!/ Come on inside!

766
01:40:26,890 --> 01:40:29,758
They re from the depths. They are afraid of lights.

767
01:40:47,795 --> 01:40:49,696
Get ready to jump.

768
01:41:57,798 --> 01:41:59,699
Over there!

769
01:42:34,735 --> 01:42:38,695
That thing will tear us apart.
/We don't have a choice.

770
01:42:58,859 --> 01:43:00,725
Arthur!

771
01:43:03,698 --> 01:43:04,791
Mera!

772
01:43:35,696 --> 01:43:39,599
Mera! Mera!

773
01:44:01,622 --> 01:44:02,851
Mera!

774
01:44:49,837 --> 01:44:53,638
Arthur./Mom.

775
01:45:31,745 --> 01:45:34,806
They sacrificed me to the Trench.

776
01:45:34,849 --> 01:45:38,752
But I survived, fought my way through like you did,

777
01:45:38,752 --> 01:45:41,813
and I ended up here./You've been here
alone for twenty years?

778
01:45:41,856 --> 01:45:45,793
Yes. Come, sit here.

779
01:45:49,730 --> 01:45:53,758
You must forgive me.
Forgive me for everything.

780
01:45:53,801 --> 01:45:56,771
This happened because you had me.

781
01:45:57,705 --> 01:45:59,674
Not for having you.

782
01:45:59,707 --> 01:46:02,676
None of this is your fault.

783
01:46:02,676 --> 01:46:03,837
I made a choice.

784
01:46:03,844 --> 01:46:07,576
I had to leave to say you.

785
01:46:07,615 --> 01:46:09,880
To save your father.

786
01:46:11,619 --> 01:46:15,818
Tell me, tell me about him. Is he….

787
01:46:19,693 --> 01:46:22,629
He still walks to the end of the dock…

788
01:46:23,864 --> 01:46:25,856
Every morning.

789
01:46:27,868 --> 01:46:29,734
…Every day.

790
01:46:31,872 --> 01:46:34,808
Waiting for you.

791
01:46:41,815 --> 01:46:43,807
Why didn't you ever come back?

792
01:46:48,722 --> 01:46:52,659
Because the portal that brought you here
will never let us return.

793
01:46:53,627 --> 01:46:56,722
The Trident is the only way back.

794
01:46:56,730 --> 01:47:01,634
But it is guarded by the Karathen.

795
01:47:02,636 --> 01:47:05,697
The creature from our legend is real.

796
01:47:05,706 --> 01:47:08,767
It lies beyond the waterfall.

797
01:47:12,680 --> 01:47:16,617
We'll go with you. We fight it together.
/No.

798
01:47:16,617 --> 01:47:18,779
Its; too powerful.

799
01:47:18,819 --> 01:47:21,789
I've tried many times over the years.

800
01:47:22,690 --> 01:47:25,751
The creature will only allow the true king to pass.

801
01:47:28,629 --> 01:47:30,689
You're afraid.

802
01:47:32,666 --> 01:47:34,658
Yes.

803
01:47:34,868 --> 01:47:37,599
Good.

804
01:47:37,905 --> 01:47:39,897
You're ready.

805
01:47:40,774 --> 01:47:43,744
Atlantis had always had a king.

806
01:47:43,777 --> 01:47:46,611
Now it needs something more.

807
01:47:46,647 --> 01:47:48,707
What could be greater than a king?

808
01:47:49,683 --> 01:47:52,653
A hero.

809
01:47:52,686 --> 01:47:54,655
A king only fights for its nation.

810
01:47:54,655 --> 01:47:58,820
You fight for everyone.

811
01:49:27,848 --> 01:49:32,616
You do not belong here.

812
01:49:33,654 --> 01:49:42,825
I have guarded the Trident against false
kings since the beginning and for a thousand years.

813
01:49:42,863 --> 01:49:47,597
I have seen the greatest champion tried,

814
01:49:47,601 --> 01:49:48,762
and failed.

815
01:49:48,802 --> 01:49:54,742
But never have I sense one as unworthy as you.

816
01:49:54,742 --> 01:50:01,706
You dare to come here with your tainted
mongrel blood

817
01:50:01,715 --> 01:50:05,743
to claim Atlantis's greatest treasure?

818
01:50:07,755 --> 01:50:09,747
So be it.

819
01:50:10,624 --> 01:50:12,650
Half breed.

820
01:50:31,712 --> 01:50:34,739
You thought yourself worthy?

821
01:50:34,748 --> 01:50:37,718
You thought yourself a king?

822
01:50:37,751 --> 01:50:42,746
You dishonour this place with your presence.

823
01:50:50,731 --> 01:50:54,759
You're right. I am a half breed
mongrel.

824
01:50:54,802 --> 01:50:59,763
But I did not come here because I thought I was worthy.
I know I'm not.

825
01:50:59,807 --> 01:51:06,611
You understand me./
I do.

826
01:51:06,613 --> 01:51:13,645
No mortal has conversed with me since King Atlan.

827
01:51:13,887 --> 01:51:17,824
Who are you?

828
01:51:17,858 --> 01:51:19,827
I'm nobody.

829
01:51:21,628 --> 01:51:24,598
I came because I have no choice.

830
01:51:25,899 --> 01:51:28,733
I came to save my home,

831
01:51:28,769 --> 01:51:30,761
and the people that I love.

832
01:51:32,939 --> 01:51:37,070
I came because the Trident is our only hope.

833
01:51:37,077 --> 01:51:39,979
And if that's not good enough,

834
01:51:41,915 --> 01:51:43,941
then screw you.

835
01:51:45,886 --> 01:51:52,850
No man has ever freed the Trident from Atlann's grip.

836
01:51:52,893 --> 01:51:57,024
Should he deemed you unworthy,

837
01:51:57,030 --> 01:52:02,867
Well I haven't insisted in yours

838
01:52:02,903 --> 01:52:05,964
and I am damaged

839
01:53:33,994 --> 01:53:37,829
The one true king.

840
01:53:50,811 --> 01:53:58,048
Remember, the Brine are a powerful savage group
It will sweep us all and declare their leadership will turn the tide.

841
01:53:58,051 --> 01:54:03,786
Defeat the Brine king and you will command the greatest military might on this planet.

842
01:54:04,991 --> 01:54:07,051
Today we unite our kingdoms.

843
01:54:08,061 --> 01:54:10,929
Tomorrow we scorch the surface!

844
01:54:12,732 --> 01:54:17,864
Rise, Atlantians!

845
01:54:39,892 --> 01:54:41,827
Go!

846
01:55:55,868 --> 01:55:58,667
No, we need him.

847
01:56:00,606 --> 01:56:05,738
You expect me to address you as Your Highness?

848
01:56:05,745 --> 01:56:07,646
Not Your Highness

849
01:56:07,847 --> 01:56:12,785
Call me Ocean Master.

850
01:56:12,785 --> 01:56:17,655
You can take my army,
you sub belly slut,

851
01:56:17,690 --> 01:56:20,785
You will never have my allegiance!

852
01:56:20,826 --> 01:56:21,816
So be it!

853
01:57:29,795 --> 01:57:31,821
The King has risen.

854
01:57:39,605 --> 01:57:41,767
Attack!

855
01:59:40,426 --> 01:59:42,625
There's too many casualties.
We have to stop fighting now.

856
01:59:42,762 --> 01:59:45,755
I'll find my father.
You must defeat Orm.

857
01:59:46,933 --> 01:59:50,802
And what if I can't?/
Last time you was in his element.

858
01:59:51,771 --> 01:59:54,969
This time, make him fight in yours.

859
02:00:23,803 --> 02:00:26,932
What's the plan again?/
Plan is not to get killed.

860
02:00:27,874 --> 02:00:30,844
Ya. Good plan. Not get killed.

861
02:01:03,776 --> 02:01:06,803
The Trident. He has the Trident./ Impossible!

862
02:01:23,730 --> 02:01:25,858
Stand down! Let her pass.

863
02:01:25,865 --> 02:01:27,800
Please, father.

864
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:28,893
He has the Trident.

865
02:01:28,935 --> 02:01:30,961
I know you think this was necessary.

866
02:01:31,004 --> 02:01:33,940
But Arthur is king by our most sacred law.

867
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:35,966
And if you turn your back on that now

868
02:01:35,975 --> 02:01:38,911
then the Atlantis you're fighting for is already dead./ It's true.

869
02:01:38,945 --> 02:01:42,712
The half breed wields King Atlan's Trident./
He …the sea.

870
02:01:43,983 --> 02:01:46,748
Then the half breed is your king.

871
02:03:02,929 --> 02:03:06,024
Vulko! Come on, he needs our help.

872
02:03:06,065 --> 02:03:08,034
We can't. Look.

873
02:03:08,034 --> 02:03:11,061
The people must bear witness.

874
02:03:15,942 --> 02:03:18,776
The Trident doesn't change what you are.

875
02:03:19,045 --> 02:03:21,844
Half breed bastard.

876
02:03:22,982 --> 02:03:26,919
Atlantis will never accept you as it's King.

877
02:03:28,988 --> 02:03:31,822
Well then my blood shed

878
02:03:32,825 --> 02:03:35,056
will the gods make on your will.

879
02:04:04,857 --> 02:04:05,916
Yield the throne.

880
02:05:42,054 --> 02:05:44,853
Finish it./Yield the throne.

881
02:05:44,891 --> 02:05:46,951
Mercy is not our way.

882
02:05:47,994 --> 02:05:50,930
Maybe you don't know this brother.

883
02:05:55,001 --> 02:05:57,994
But I'm not one of you./ Do it!

884
02:06:00,940 --> 02:06:03,967
Kill me!/No!

885
02:06:05,978 --> 02:06:08,038
That is enough killing!

886
02:06:14,820 --> 02:06:16,083
Mother.

887
02:06:17,023 --> 02:06:19,822
Orm, my son.

888
02:06:27,867 --> 02:06:30,996
It's a long story.
I'll tell you later.

889
02:06:31,938 --> 02:06:33,873
Come on.

890
02:06:40,046 --> 02:06:47,044
I don't understand. We thought…/
I know. Arthur saved me.

891
02:06:50,890 --> 02:06:53,917
You're with him?/I am.

892
02:06:55,061 --> 02:06:59,795
You're both my children,
and I love you so much.

893
02:07:00,066 --> 02:07:03,901
But you have been misguided.

894
02:07:03,903 --> 02:07:09,035
Your father taught you that there were two worlds.
He was wrong.

895
02:07:09,041 --> 02:07:16,778
The land and the sea are one.

896
02:07:35,901 --> 02:07:37,836
My Queen.

897
02:07:39,839 --> 02:07:40,898
Vulko.

898
02:07:42,975 --> 02:07:48,039
Take him. But make sure he has a view.

899
02:07:54,954 --> 02:07:59,016
When you're ready… let's talk.

900
02:08:15,040 --> 02:08:20,979
People of Atlantis, today we gather in bloodshed.

901
02:08:20,979 --> 02:08:25,940
I give you, King
Arthur, of Atlantis.

902
02:08:25,984 --> 02:08:30,888
Hail to the King!

903
02:08:39,998 --> 02:08:43,935
So what do I do now?/
Be their king.

904
02:08:46,805 --> 02:08:48,933
This is gonna be fun.

905
02:09:38,423 --> 02:09:41,416
I love you./
I love you too.

906
02:09:41,460 --> 02:09:43,520
You're back./Yes.

907
02:09:51,336 --> 02:09:53,396
My father was my housekeeper.

908
02:09:54,373 --> 02:09:57,343
My mother was a queen.

909
02:09:57,542 --> 02:09:59,534
They were never meant to meet.

910
02:10:03,415 --> 02:10:06,408
But their love saved the world.

911
02:10:08,353 --> 02:10:10,322
They made me what I am.

912
02:10:10,355 --> 02:10:14,383
A son of the land, a king of the seas.

913
02:10:16,295 --> 02:10:20,289
I am the protector of the deep.

914
02:10:20,295 --> 02:10:23,289
I am Aquaman.
