15
00:02:56,283 --> 00:02:58,314
I don't want to have to wait
for full clean-up just to get

16
00:02:58,316 --> 00:02:59,783
- a status report.
- We're collecting this data

17
00:03:00,018 --> 00:03:01,783
- as quickly as possible.
- That's not good enough.

18
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:03,582
Okay, maybe you can tell me
what happened.

19
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:05,381
There was some kind of breach.
One of the astronauts

20
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:07,748
- sent a distress call.
- What about the crew?

21
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,381
- We're still investigating.
- Where did it go down?

22
00:03:11,383 --> 00:03:13,382
It's 20 kilometers
west of Sibu.

23
00:03:13,384 --> 00:03:15,582
Did we at least retrieve
all of the samples?

24
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,382
No. We have
three of them.

25
00:03:17,384 --> 00:03:19,348
One of the organisms
got out of containment,

26
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,417
and it's missing.
We don't know which one.

27
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:37,449
What is she saying?

28
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,585
One of the astronauts
is still alive.

29
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:46,583
That's Jameson.

30
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:11,786
- Morning, sunshine.
- What?

31
00:05:11,788 --> 00:05:13,221
I'm awake.

32
00:05:14,321 --> 00:05:15,653
Missed me.

33
00:05:15,655 --> 00:05:17,352
- I'm awake.
- Here you go.

34
00:05:17,354 --> 00:05:19,585
- You can have it back.
- Thank...

35
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:22,619
Oh, wow,
you're wearing a suit. Yes!

36
00:05:22,621 --> 00:05:25,119
- I love it when you wear the suit.
- Thank you.

37
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:27,419
I have depositions today
in the Life Foundation case.

38
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:29,686
Hey, let me know
how your meeting goes.

39
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:31,320
My meeting?

40
00:05:31,322 --> 00:05:33,185
Oh, shit. Yeah.

41
00:05:33,187 --> 00:05:35,088
My meeting.

42
00:05:39,087 --> 00:05:41,587
- Coffee.
- Oh. Mmm!

43
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:43,487
- You are perfect.
- Thank you.

44
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:45,387
Hey, you know what...
You know what night

45
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:47,219
- it is tonight, right?
- Date night.

46
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,153
Mmm-hmm. So, I will pick
you up around, uh, 6:00.

47
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:52,587
And please do not forget
your helmet.

48
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:54,153
Oh, I'm glad
that you like it,

49
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:55,654
'cause I plan on wearing it
at our wedding.

50
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,387
That's hot.

51
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:59,287
Feed the cat.

52
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:00,587
I will.

53
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:02,120
I love you!

54
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:03,721
Love you, too.
Feed the cat.

<i>I'm Eddie Brock,</i>

72
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:06,389
Hey, Richard!

73
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:08,824
- Lookin' good!
- Eddie, you can't park there, bro.

74
00:07:09,057 --> 00:07:11,155
Come on, man. There's
no such thing as can't.

75
00:07:11,157 --> 00:07:12,422
How'd she do?

76
00:07:12,424 --> 00:07:15,356
Berkeley. Brown. MIT.

77
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:17,355
- She's got a scholarship, bro.
- What'd I tell you?

78
00:07:17,357 --> 00:07:18,825
You told me what?

79
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:20,791
- No such thing as can't.
- Eddie.

80
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:23,356
The bike.

81
00:07:23,358 --> 00:07:26,757
MIT! Whoo!

82
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:30,224
You know what I love
about this view?

83
00:07:30,226 --> 00:07:32,825
- It never gets old.
- Yeah, well, uh...

84
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:35,723
Height's not really my thing.

85
00:07:35,725 --> 00:07:38,291
But, uh...
What's the deal?

86
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:40,658
- I got you the big one, exclusive.
- Yeah? Who?

87
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,290
Carlton Drake.

88
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,324
- Carlton Drake?
- The man's a visionary.

89
00:07:44,326 --> 00:07:46,524
He wants to talk
about his rockets,

90
00:07:46,526 --> 00:07:49,224
assure everyone they're safe,
that the crash was an anomaly.

91
00:07:49,226 --> 00:07:50,591
Uh...

92
00:07:50,593 --> 00:07:52,591
He's... He's seriously off.

93
00:07:52,593 --> 00:07:54,290
I'm gonna level with you.

94
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,691
Carlton Drake could buy us
with his pocket cash,

95
00:07:56,693 --> 00:08:00,124
turn this building into his
own garage if he so wished.

96
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:03,124
Now, you're just gonna ask him
about his space program,

97
00:08:03,126 --> 00:08:05,526
you're gonna thank him, and
you're gonna bid him a nice day.

98
00:08:07,127 --> 00:08:10,457
He's a crook.

99
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:13,658
Eddie, when you had nowhere
to go, we gave you a home.

100
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,827
Now, you know we love
the Eddie Brock show.

101
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:18,759
There isn't a better investigative
reporter working today,

102
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:20,525
but no one
is above the network.

103
00:08:20,527 --> 00:08:23,592
So do me a favor, Eddie,
don't start your shit again.

104
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:25,292
All right, all right.

105
00:08:25,294 --> 00:08:29,659
- For me.
- All right. I'll do it.

106
00:08:29,661 --> 00:08:31,325
I don't know why he gave
me this assignment, Annie.

107
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:33,125
It's not...
It's not what I do.

108
00:08:33,127 --> 00:08:34,659
Well, my mother
always told me

109
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:37,625
that anything in life worth
having would take sacrifice...

110
00:08:37,627 --> 00:08:38,827
- Mmm-hmm.
- Patience...

111
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,258
- Mmm.
- And be a lot of work.

112
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,692
- Oh.
- That's you...

113
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:44,359
- That's not.
- ...that I'm talking about.

114
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:45,560
- Nah.
- Yeah.

115
00:08:45,562 --> 00:08:46,760
Well, you're lucky
to have me.

116
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:48,760
To be fair,
I'm quite a catch.

117
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,226
That's what my mom told me.

118
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:53,258
Are you gonna
behave yourself tomorrow?

119
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,493
No. No, I'm gonna do my job.
That's what I'm gonna do.

120
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:58,560
I can't, you know,
not do my job.

121
00:08:58,562 --> 00:09:00,426
The guy you work for
is a complete...

122
00:09:00,428 --> 00:09:02,493
I don't work for Drake.
I work for my firm,

123
00:09:02,495 --> 00:09:04,126
and my firm works for him.

124
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:06,593
And I'm sure
that they defend many people

125
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:09,694
that you don't deem worthy,
but we don't want a repeat.

126
00:09:09,696 --> 00:09:12,459
- A repeat?
- Of the <i>Daily Globe</i> incident.

127
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:14,193
Ow! Really?

128
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:15,795
- Incident? That's not an incident.
- Mmm-hmm.

129
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:17,293
- Baby, you were run out of New York.
- I was not. I did not.

130
00:09:17,295 --> 00:09:18,694
I don't want you
run out of San Francisco.

131
00:09:18,696 --> 00:09:21,227
No, I still have
currency in New York.

132
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:23,527
I was going places.

133
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,627
I wasn't running.

134
00:09:24,629 --> 00:09:26,394
I was going places.

135
00:09:26,396 --> 00:09:28,227
In fact, I moved
to San Francisco for you.

136
00:09:28,229 --> 00:09:31,093
- Me?
- You are my home.

137
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:33,829
You're not so bad yourself,
champ.

138
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,495
- Less talking, more kissing.
- All right.

139
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:40,762
Let's just get the check.

140
00:10:08,364 --> 00:10:10,463
I'm gonna get a drink.

141
00:10:54,632 --> 00:10:56,098
Shh.

142
00:11:11,599 --> 00:11:14,664
Very soon,
another Life Foundation rocket

143
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,230
will be sent
on an exploratory mission.

144
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:20,497
And that's how, one day,
we might all live in space.

145
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:23,196
Cool, huh? And now that I've shown you

146
00:11:23,198 --> 00:11:25,330
some of the cool stuff
that we do here,

147
00:11:25,332 --> 00:11:27,598
I'm hoping I've inspired
each and every one of you

148
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,798
to go out there
and create things that others

149
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,197
- have only dreamt of.
- Mr. Drake?

150
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:35,264
- Shh!
- It's okay. Don't silence her.

151
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:37,197
Come here. What's your name?

152
00:11:37,199 --> 00:11:39,231
- Allie.
- It's okay, Allie.

153
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:40,801
You know, sometimes
that's what people do.

154
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,498
They try and silence
those of us who ask questions.

155
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,566
But you know what?
In the end,

156
00:11:45,568 --> 00:11:48,498
we're the ones
who change the world.

157
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,432
Take good care
of that, Allie.

158
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:53,197
Guys, this is Dr. Skirth.

159
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:54,565
- Say hi.
- Hi.

160
00:11:54,567 --> 00:11:55,766
Hello, kids.

161
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:57,798
Um, sorry to interrupt,

162
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,164
but it's time to get changed
for your interview.

163
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,365
Yeah. Uh, kids,
sorry to leave you.

164
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,666
Allie, you're in charge.
High five up top.

165
00:12:04,668 --> 00:12:08,132
Dr. Skirth will answer Allie's
question, and any others.

166
00:12:08,134 --> 00:12:09,801
- See you next time, guys. Bye!
- Bye!

167
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:11,834
<i>What do you say,
Mr. Drake,</i>

168
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,799
we just start
at the beginning?

169
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:15,834
- Born to British parents.
- Mmm-hmm.

170
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:19,365
And then at 19, you
discovered a gene therapy

171
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:22,165
that literally doubles
the life expectancy

172
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:23,667
- of pancreatic cancer patients.
- Well, actually,

173
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:25,732
it tripled their
life expectancy.

174
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:27,400
But it's okay.

175
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:30,433
Okay, um, 24.
That's still extremely young.

176
00:12:30,435 --> 00:12:32,432
All right, you create

177
00:12:32,434 --> 00:12:34,133
- the Life Foundation!
- It didn't happen overnight.

178
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:35,800
- And then...
- Rockets.

179
00:12:35,802 --> 00:12:37,802
You then decide,
like any normal human being,

180
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:39,802
that you're gonna go
and explore space.

181
00:12:40,036 --> 00:12:42,333
You know what it is?
I have always believed...

182
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:44,166
- Uh-huh.
- ...that space exploration

183
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:45,767
is crucial
in our quest to cure

184
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:47,701
everything that ails us
here on Earth.

185
00:12:47,703 --> 00:12:49,266
But if you think about
everything we've found...

186
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,700
- Uh-huh.
- ...in the oceans and on land,

187
00:12:50,702 --> 00:12:52,634
- isn't it time to look up there?
- Mmm-hmm.

188
00:12:52,636 --> 00:12:55,134
To this plethora
of untapped resources?

189
00:12:55,136 --> 00:12:56,633
And you have a plethora
of untapped resources, also,

190
00:12:56,635 --> 00:12:58,467
from your pharmaceutical
companies

191
00:12:58,469 --> 00:13:00,266
that you're involved with,
you know, to help you realize

192
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:01,466
- that ambition, I suppose.
- Of course.

193
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:02,801
- Yeah.
- Full circle.

194
00:13:02,803 --> 00:13:05,100
So, I have to ask,
how does that work,

195
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:06,701
you know, exactly,
the Life Foundation thing?

196
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,701
How does it...
How does it, um...

197
00:13:08,703 --> 00:13:10,634
I don't know,
how does it go about,

198
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:13,701
- say, testing pharmaceuticals?
- Eddie, we're talking

199
00:13:13,703 --> 00:13:15,535
- about the rocket here.
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

200
00:13:15,537 --> 00:13:17,534
I'm talking
about the allegations.

201
00:13:17,536 --> 00:13:19,135
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- It says that

202
00:13:19,137 --> 00:13:20,634
your entire empire
has been built

203
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:22,702
- on dead bodies.
- Eddie.

204
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:25,135
It's true, right?
It says that you recruit

205
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,335
the most vulnerable of us
to volunteer for tests...

206
00:13:27,337 --> 00:13:28,669
- Hmm.
- ...that more often than not

207
00:13:28,671 --> 00:13:30,234
end up killing people.

208
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:31,735
Yeah, I'm aware
of these rumors online.

209
00:13:31,737 --> 00:13:33,101
There's a lot of fake news
out there these days.

210
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,535
Right. What about
the legal cases?

211
00:13:34,537 --> 00:13:36,100
Sorry?

212
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:38,235
Uh, the actual legal cases,
like Sarah Chambers,

213
00:13:38,237 --> 00:13:40,168
- Phil Barclay, Rob MacDonald.
- That's it. Time to go.

214
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,502
Thank you so much for coming
to talk to me, Mr. Brock.

215
00:13:41,504 --> 00:13:43,101
And they're just some
of the people who walked

216
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:45,101
- through these doors...
- Have a nice day.

217
00:13:45,103 --> 00:13:46,769
- Cut the camera off, please.
- Thank you very much.

218
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:48,468
- Time is up. Come on.
- They're dead. The Dead...

219
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:49,735
- Could you show him out, please?
- The Dead Found...

220
00:13:49,737 --> 00:13:51,536
Don't touch me.
The Dead Foundation thing.

221
00:13:51,538 --> 00:13:52,403
- Get out of here, Brock.
- We're not finished.

222
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:53,268
Yes, you are, Mr. Brock.

223
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,135
Is that a threat?

224
00:13:54,137 --> 00:13:55,771
Have a nice life.

225
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:01,435
I know what
you're going to say, but...

226
00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:04,102
This guy, he is
all the way bad, Jack.

227
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:06,135
- If you just give...
- Who's your source?

228
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,672
- Excuse me?
- Who's your source, Eddie?

229
00:14:13,071 --> 00:14:16,102
I don't have a source, per se.
But I have a hunch.

230
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:17,839
This isn't the Wild Wild West.

231
00:14:18,071 --> 00:14:20,803
We don't go off half-cocked
based on a hunch.

232
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:22,369
We do the work.

233
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:24,839
We substantiate
our accusations.

234
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,137
We provide evidence.

235
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:30,470
You know, for a smart guy,
you really are a dumbass.

236
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:38,403
You're fired, Eddie.

237
00:14:38,405 --> 00:14:40,404
I can't trust you.

238
00:14:40,406 --> 00:14:42,806
Have a nice life.

239
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,806
- Will just take a second.
- Okay.

240
00:14:46,372 --> 00:14:47,671
Hey.

241
00:14:47,673 --> 00:14:49,671
You are pathologically
self-absorbed.

242
00:14:49,673 --> 00:14:51,203
Annie. Annie,
can you talk to me first?

243
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:52,237
Your ego requires
constant attention,

244
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:54,304
and you're stubborn as hell.

245
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:56,537
But I was willing to roll with
it, Eddie, because I loved you.

246
00:14:56,539 --> 00:14:58,706
You "loved" me?
What is that supposed to mean?

247
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:02,739
What you did
got me fired.

248
00:15:04,173 --> 00:15:05,574
You used me.

249
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,607
Annie? Annie.

250
00:15:48,241 --> 00:15:50,208
Oh, my God.

251
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,341
You're beautiful.

252
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:54,276
Test 36.

253
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:55,810
Biological interactions

254
00:17:55,812 --> 00:17:58,143
between two different organisms.

255
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:00,744
These creatures need to bond
with a respiratory host

256
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,777
in order to survive
for any amount of time

257
00:18:02,779 --> 00:18:04,610
in an oxygen-rich environment.

258
00:18:04,612 --> 00:18:05,812
Well, why are
all these hosts

259
00:18:06,046 --> 00:18:07,578
showing this hyper-acute
rejection?

260
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,545
That's what
we're trying to find out.

261
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:13,780
The bonding process
is starting.

262
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:20,279
It's equalizing.

263
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:29,344
But why? Why this rabbit?

264
00:18:29,346 --> 00:18:31,814
- It's similar to an organ transplant.
- Huh.

265
00:18:32,048 --> 00:18:34,778
Where the donor and recipient
must be an exact match?

266
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,344
- That's correct.
- Okay. So wait, think about it.

267
00:18:37,346 --> 00:18:41,211
If we do achieve symbiosis, they
should be able to survive here,

268
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:45,511
but also we would
be able to survive there.

269
00:18:45,513 --> 00:18:47,211
"We"?

270
00:18:47,213 --> 00:18:49,345
- Begin human trials.
- Oh, it's way too soon

271
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:51,311
to even begin to think
about something like...

272
00:18:51,313 --> 00:18:52,745
Dr. Skirth, you're at the forefront
of a scientific breakthrough.

273
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:55,245
I need you to hold your nerve.
All right?

274
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:56,814
I understand,
but it's an ethical question.

275
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:58,779
Think of future generations.
Think of your kids.

276
00:18:58,781 --> 00:19:00,647
Hey, how are your kids?

277
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:04,179
Let's begin human trials.

278
00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:05,315
Good work.

279
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,748
Hey, Jack.

280
00:19:30,448 --> 00:19:32,713
Do you ever feel
like your life

281
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:36,346
- is like one monumental screwup?
- Nope.

282
00:19:36,348 --> 00:19:37,849
<i>Here at the Life Foundation,</i>

283
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:40,113
- <i>we've always believed...</i>
- Isn't that your buddy?

284
00:19:40,115 --> 00:19:41,581
<i>...in finding the lessons
in our disappointments.</i>

285
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,279
<i>In the months
since our rocket failed,</i>

286
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:44,814
<i>we've learned so much.</i>

287
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,815
Do you think we could,
like, switch him off?

288
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:49,514
Some people
are trying to watch that.

289
00:19:49,516 --> 00:19:50,816
Oh, you are, are you?

290
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,416
- Yeah?
- Aren't you Eddie Brock?

291
00:19:55,316 --> 00:19:56,816
I used to be.

292
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,714
<i>We take
the same view of progress.</i>

293
00:19:58,716 --> 00:20:01,347
<i>Thrilled to announce
that the Life Foundation</i>

294
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:04,315
<i>has now begun preparations
on its next launch.</i>

295
00:20:04,317 --> 00:20:05,714
All right, Jack,
this is for you.

296
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:07,682
I do not want you
to spend it all at once.

297
00:20:07,684 --> 00:20:09,714
I'm going to go home and chase
myself around the room,

298
00:20:09,716 --> 00:20:11,714
playing hard to get.

299
00:20:15,316 --> 00:20:17,181
- Hey, Maria.
- Eddie.

300
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,815
- How's it going?
- Righteous, Eddie.

301
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:21,817
Oh! Yeah, we're empty.

302
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,181
Cost you $5.

303
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,315
$5 for a paper that's free?

304
00:20:28,317 --> 00:20:30,315
I walked all the way over
to the vending machine,

305
00:20:30,317 --> 00:20:33,115
got the papers out and
brought 'em back over here,

306
00:20:33,117 --> 00:20:35,583
so you can have 'em
personally delivered to you.

307
00:20:35,585 --> 00:20:36,649
You did that for me?

308
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:38,250
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

309
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:42,316
- Five bucks.
- That's pretty steep.

310
00:20:42,318 --> 00:20:44,749
Tell you what, you give
me a dollar for a song,

311
00:20:44,751 --> 00:20:46,415
I'll throw in the paper.

312
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:49,148
I'll tell you what,
I will give you 20 bucks,

313
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,618
but not to sing,
all right?

314
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,382
Deal.

315
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,282
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

316
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:58,115
No. You're welcome.

317
00:20:58,117 --> 00:21:00,416
Hey, Mrs. Chen.

318
00:21:00,418 --> 00:21:02,683
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Ah, aches and pains,

319
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:04,683
you know, aches and pains.

320
00:21:04,685 --> 00:21:05,851
You look like shit.

321
00:21:06,752 --> 00:21:08,249
Excuse me?

322
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:09,618
You look like shit.

323
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:13,817
And you look
as beautiful as ever.

324
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:16,549
- Jesus.
- Mind is body, Eddie.

325
00:21:16,551 --> 00:21:18,417
Have you been meditating
like I showed you?

326
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,417
- No, I have not. And it does not work.
- It doesn't work,

327
00:21:20,419 --> 00:21:22,549
- because you don't give it a chance.
- No, it doesn't work,

328
00:21:22,551 --> 00:21:25,750
because I bought a DVD off your
cousin, and it was in Mandarin.

329
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:28,550
Yeah, I don't understand that, either.

330
00:21:28,552 --> 00:21:30,283
See, that right there, I don't
understand what you just said.

331
00:21:30,285 --> 00:21:31,450
That is the problem.

332
00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:39,317
Bottle of whiskey,
and don't forget my change.

333
00:21:39,319 --> 00:21:41,717
Please.

334
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:43,183
Let's go.

335
00:21:43,185 --> 00:21:44,685
Before the price goes up
for my protection.

336
00:21:47,486 --> 00:21:50,718
The full payment is due.
Now.

337
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,818
Make sure you have
my money ready, Chen.

338
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,520
I don't like to wait.

339
00:22:12,688 --> 00:22:13,788
Life hurts, Eddie.

340
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,787
It just does.

341
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,118
I gotta go.

342
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,186
- Okay. Love you, babe.
- See you, babe.

343
00:22:43,589 --> 00:22:44,820
What a dick.

344
00:23:14,322 --> 00:23:16,154
I'm not even
asking to staff there.

345
00:23:16,156 --> 00:23:17,687
Why would I do that?
I can't use my name.

346
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:19,153
I can use a pseudonym.

347
00:23:19,155 --> 00:23:20,621
Any name. Think...
You pick a name.

348
00:23:20,623 --> 00:23:22,620
I could be a woman.
Have you seen <i>Tootsie?</i>

349
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:29,520
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

350
00:23:29,522 --> 00:23:31,389
Okay, I won't. Thank you. Bye.

351
00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:42,821
<i>Realize deeply that the
present moment is all you ever have.</i>

352
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:46,654
<i>Make the now the primary
focus of your life.</i>

353
00:23:46,656 --> 00:23:49,120
<i>Any action is often better
than no action,</i>

354
00:23:49,122 --> 00:23:50,755
<i>especially if you
have been stuck</i>

355
00:23:50,757 --> 00:23:54,488
<i>in an unhappy situation
for a long time.</i>

356
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,488
<i>If it is a mistake, at least
you learned something,</i>

357
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,121
<i>in which case
it's no longer...</i>

358
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:21,355
Thank you all for
bringing us to this moment.

359
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:25,790
Our names will be spoken
long after we are dust.

360
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:27,457
History starts now.

361
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,156
This is day one.

362
00:24:30,158 --> 00:24:33,423
This is first contact.

363
00:24:33,425 --> 00:24:35,790
Let's get to work.

364
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:50,759
<i>Establishing subject baseline.</i>

365
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,091
<i>All vital signs are normal.</i>

366
00:25:01,693 --> 00:25:03,824
Put me through.

367
00:25:03,826 --> 00:25:05,659
There's no need to be
frightened, Isaac.

368
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:09,457
There's no need.

369
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:12,490
Isaac. You know
that's a biblical name?

370
00:25:12,492 --> 00:25:14,524
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

371
00:25:14,526 --> 00:25:16,657
<i>God said to Abraham,
"Give me your son,</i>

372
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:19,390
<i>"show me you are willing
to sacrifice the one thing</i>

373
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:22,557
"most precious to you,"
and Abraham was willing.

374
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,624
You know what's always
impressed me about that story?

375
00:25:24,626 --> 00:25:27,694
<i>It isn't Abraham's sacrifice.
It's Isaac's.</i>

376
00:25:32,327 --> 00:25:35,224
<i>Now, I don't know what kind of
God would ask that of someone,</i>

377
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:36,558
<i>but it doesn't change
anything for me.</i>

378
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,358
Isaac is still the hero
of this story.

379
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,258
Look around you.
Look at the world.

380
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,725
<i>What do you see?
War, poverty,</i>

381
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:47,860
<i>a planet on the brink
of collapse.</i>

382
00:25:48,093 --> 00:25:51,158
<i>I would argue that God
has abandoned us.</i>

383
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,792
He didn't keep
his end of the bargain, Isaac,

384
00:25:52,794 --> 00:25:55,825
<i>so now it's down to you and me
to put this right.</i>

385
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:58,360
<i>And this time, Isaac,
we can.</i>

386
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,358
We will.

387
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,428
<i>This time,
I will not abandon us.</i>

388
00:26:09,761 --> 00:26:10,828
<i>Yes.</i>

389
00:26:13,729 --> 00:26:14,728
Open it.

390
00:26:27,696 --> 00:26:29,793
What the hell is that?
What? No, what...

391
00:26:29,795 --> 00:26:31,527
<i>Please let me... No.</i>

392
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:33,694
Oh, please, please, please!

393
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:53,827
His vitals are holding steady.

394
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:56,528
- Where the hell did it go?
- <i>Incredible.</i>

395
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,096
<i>Where did it go?</i>

396
00:27:02,697 --> 00:27:04,260
<i>Where is it?</i>

397
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,531
Bring in the next volunteer.

398
00:28:12,564 --> 00:28:15,263
You know,
I used to be a reporter.

399
00:28:15,265 --> 00:28:16,663
I was...

400
00:28:16,665 --> 00:28:19,396
I was pretty successful,
as well, you know?

401
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:23,563
My job, it required you to...
You know, to follow people

402
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:28,866
that did not want to be followed
and hide in plain sight.

403
00:28:29,099 --> 00:28:30,663
I mean...

404
00:28:30,665 --> 00:28:32,466
You have to know
how to disappear.

405
00:28:34,165 --> 00:28:37,531
I was pretty good, but,
you know, you...

406
00:28:37,533 --> 00:28:39,466
Whoever you are, you suck.

407
00:28:40,466 --> 00:28:42,430
Okay.

408
00:28:42,432 --> 00:28:44,497
- Uh, my name is Dora Skirth.
- Mmm.

409
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:45,831
I need your help.

410
00:28:45,833 --> 00:28:47,531
- I work at the Life Foundation.
- You do?

411
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:49,264
- Yes.
- Wow. Good for you.

412
00:28:49,266 --> 00:28:51,264
We're done.

413
00:28:51,266 --> 00:28:52,864
No...

414
00:28:52,866 --> 00:28:56,197
Mr. Brock, please...
Please listen to me.

415
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:58,264
Everything that you
accused him of,

416
00:28:58,266 --> 00:28:59,598
you were right.
It's all true.

417
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,130
- I don't care anymore.
- Really?

418
00:29:01,132 --> 00:29:03,197
Because he's got a lab
filled with poor people,

419
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,531
and they're all signing waivers
that they don't understand,

420
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:07,365
and he's using them
like guinea pigs,

421
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:09,432
and they are dying.

422
00:29:09,434 --> 00:29:11,531
They are all dying.

423
00:29:11,533 --> 00:29:13,100
- You've seen that?
- Yes.

424
00:29:14,068 --> 00:29:15,267
Come here.

425
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:18,498
Why would I believe you?

426
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,665
Because it's true.

427
00:29:19,667 --> 00:29:21,432
I believed in him, and I...

428
00:29:21,434 --> 00:29:23,365
I told myself
that it was worth it

429
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:25,533
because we were curing cancer,
but now this is different.

430
00:29:25,535 --> 00:29:26,867
- Something else.
- Go to the cops.

431
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,398
I can't do that.

432
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,199
I'm afraid of what
will happen to my family.

433
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:31,832
He's a very dangerous man, and
he's a very powerful man...

434
00:29:31,834 --> 00:29:33,499
I know, I know
how dangerous he is,

435
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:35,166
because the very first time
I interviewed him,

436
00:29:35,168 --> 00:29:37,366
just once, I lose my job
the very next day.

437
00:29:37,368 --> 00:29:39,733
I lost my career,
I lost my relationship,

438
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:42,498
I lost my apartment, I lost
everything I ever cared about.

439
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,801
You know why? Carlton Drake
ruined me. Finished.

440
00:29:46,234 --> 00:29:48,333
Now, if you are
who you say you are,

441
00:29:48,335 --> 00:29:50,633
genuinely,
and you have proof,

442
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:53,700
then you should be
very, very, very afraid.

443
00:29:53,702 --> 00:29:55,733
I am.

444
00:29:55,735 --> 00:29:57,733
You need to find yourself another
white knight, Ms. Skirth,

445
00:29:57,735 --> 00:29:59,199
because I am done.

446
00:29:59,201 --> 00:30:00,568
I am done
with all of this shit.

447
00:30:01,436 --> 00:30:02,800
What shit?

448
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:05,766
All of this "saving my
fellow man" shit.

449
00:30:05,768 --> 00:30:07,336
All right? Good night.

450
00:30:26,502 --> 00:30:27,502
Eddie?

451
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:29,869
Well, hey. Whoa.

452
00:30:30,103 --> 00:30:33,133
Anne, I was just walking by,
and, uh...

453
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:34,467
I saw Mr. Belvedere.

454
00:30:34,469 --> 00:30:36,234
I felt concerned for
his welfare, so...

455
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:37,836
Eddie...

456
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,668
This is Dan.

457
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,702
- Dan, this is Eddie.
- Yeah.

458
00:30:41,704 --> 00:30:43,435
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

459
00:30:43,437 --> 00:30:44,869
- Yeah.
- Annie's told me a lot about you.

460
00:30:45,103 --> 00:30:46,167
- Really?
- Yeah.

461
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:48,168
I'm a big fan of your work.

462
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:50,501
- Thank you.
- Really?

463
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:52,704
It's pretty cool, all the
people that he took down.

464
00:30:53,604 --> 00:30:55,136
Yeah, I was one of them.

465
00:30:57,303 --> 00:30:58,668
Well, look,
I'll let you guys catch up.

466
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,303
- So I'll see you inside?
- You're the best.

467
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,170
- Really nice meeting you, man.
- Uh, you, too.

468
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,371
He has a key. You know he has a key?

469
00:31:14,504 --> 00:31:16,736
Yeah. How else
would he get in?

470
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:22,202
Yeah. Well, uh...

471
00:31:22,204 --> 00:31:24,603
So, uh, what you up to?

472
00:31:24,605 --> 00:31:27,803
You realize that's light-years away
from being any of your business, right?

473
00:31:27,805 --> 00:31:29,838
Hey, well, just asking,
you know.

474
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,402
So, is Dan, uh, a lawyer?

475
00:31:33,404 --> 00:31:35,369
No, he's a doctor.

476
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:37,405
- Surgeon, actually.
- Oh.

477
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,402
How's Mr. Belvedere, anyway?

478
00:31:40,404 --> 00:31:41,837
I would say
that he misses you,

479
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:43,603
but that would be bullshit,
'cause...

480
00:31:43,605 --> 00:31:45,303
- He's a cat.
- No, because he never liked you.

481
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:46,704
No, he's a cat,
and cats don't like anyone.

482
00:31:46,706 --> 00:31:48,839
You look good, by the way.
You doing good?

483
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,270
What are you
doing here, Eddie?

484
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,339
I'm here 'cause I miss you.

485
00:31:52,439 --> 00:31:54,336
A lot.

486
00:31:54,338 --> 00:31:55,737
You know, we were gonna
get married.

487
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:58,303
That wasn't so long ago,
and now, you know...

488
00:31:58,305 --> 00:32:00,206
I can't really believe
that we're not...

489
00:32:02,138 --> 00:32:04,606
Are we gonna try
and find our way back?

490
00:32:05,572 --> 00:32:07,106
No, we can't.

491
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:11,238
You did this, Eddie.

492
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,805
Not Carlton Drake,
not the network.

493
00:32:15,807 --> 00:32:16,873
You.

494
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:26,173
<i>Uh, hello.
This is Dr. Skirth.</i>

495
00:33:26,175 --> 00:33:27,575
Yes, Eddie Brock here.

496
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:30,408
Talk to me.

497
00:33:34,342 --> 00:33:36,506
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

498
00:33:36,508 --> 00:33:37,842
Just stay down
and shut up, please.

499
00:33:40,108 --> 00:33:42,709
<i>53.5,
win-909 RPM.</i>

500
00:33:48,475 --> 00:33:49,773
Whew.

501
00:33:49,775 --> 00:33:52,341
<i>Overpopulation
and climate change.</i>

502
00:33:52,343 --> 00:33:54,474
These are two things
that Drake cannot control.

503
00:33:54,476 --> 00:33:56,441
Yeah, got it, right.

504
00:33:56,443 --> 00:33:59,474
We are literally a generation
away from an uninhabitable Earth.

505
00:33:59,476 --> 00:34:02,307
- Uh, yeah.
- Drake is using his personal rockets

506
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:04,407
to scout real estate.

507
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:06,274
You know, it's a really
interesting story,

508
00:34:06,276 --> 00:34:08,408
but we need to just get to the
part where he's killing people.

509
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:11,474
Drake sent a ship
on a recon mission.

510
00:34:11,476 --> 00:34:14,308
On the way back,
they found a comet.

511
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,609
A comet?

512
00:34:16,611 --> 00:34:19,674
Onboard computers indicated the presence
of life, of millions of organisms.

513
00:34:19,676 --> 00:34:21,609
Wait, wait, wait, when you
say "millions of organisms,"

514
00:34:21,611 --> 00:34:23,408
- what do you mean?
- We brought back some specimens.

515
00:34:23,410 --> 00:34:24,844
You're talking about aliens?

516
00:34:25,078 --> 00:34:27,475
Like, aliens?

517
00:34:27,477 --> 00:34:28,842

518
00:34:28,844 --> 00:34:30,575
Aliens, yeah.

519
00:34:30,577 --> 00:34:32,877
Yes.

520
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,310
But we don't
call them that.

521
00:34:36,143 --> 00:34:38,175
- We call them Symbiotes.
- Symbiotes?

522
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:40,843
And they cannot survive in
our environment without help.

523
00:34:40,845 --> 00:34:45,309
Drake believes that the union
between human and Symbiote

524
00:34:45,311 --> 00:34:48,175
is the key to our survival,
but not here on Earth.

525
00:34:48,177 --> 00:34:52,643
Drake is trying to put human
beings and aliens together?

526
00:34:52,645 --> 00:34:54,141
So they can live in space?

527
00:34:54,143 --> 00:34:55,575
We call them hosts.

528
00:34:55,577 --> 00:34:58,376
That's nuts, isn't it?
That's completely insane.

529
00:34:58,378 --> 00:35:00,476
Yes. There's no protocol
for this thing.

530
00:35:00,478 --> 00:35:01,743

We don't know what happened.

584
00:40:38,488 --> 00:40:39,620
- Already did, sir.
- But I didn't.

585
00:40:39,622 --> 00:40:41,454
Get it out of my sight.

586
00:40:41,456 --> 00:40:43,587
- Carlton, you need to see this.
- What now?

587
00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:45,453

589
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:51,520

590
00:40:51,522 --> 00:40:53,522
See, his body just needed
time to adjust.

591
00:40:56,522 --> 00:40:58,521
I don't want to waste any more time.
I want to up the tests.

592
00:40:58,523 --> 00:40:59,889
- Okay?
- Yeah.

593
00:41:02,156 --> 00:41:03,256

688
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,262
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Mrs. Manfredi. How are you?

689
00:45:28,264 --> 00:45:29,830
Oh, I just saw Morris.

690
00:45:29,832 --> 00:45:32,898
And he's whining and complaining
like an old baby again.

691
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:34,865
- Oh, good.
- Oh, thank you so much.

692
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,162
Yeah, my pleasure.

693
00:45:37,164 --> 00:45:38,863
Okay, Mrs. Manfredi,
we talked about the dog.

694
00:45:38,865 --> 00:45:40,463
Okay, love the dog.
You can't have the dog.

695
00:45:40,465 --> 00:45:42,530
Sorry. Gemini.

696
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:44,162
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
All right? That I can promise you.

697
00:45:44,164 --> 00:45:45,596
- But for now, go home, get some rest.
- Uh-huh.

698
00:45:45,598 --> 00:45:47,163
I'll call you when
your tests are in.

699
00:45:47,165 --> 00:45:48,497
- All right, thank you.
- Okay? Yep.

700
00:45:48,499 --> 00:45:49,633
- Thank you, Dan. Thank you.
- You got it.

701
00:45:52,232 --> 00:45:53,630
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.

702
00:45:53,632 --> 00:45:54,863
Did you have
the same reactions

703
00:45:54,865 --> 00:45:56,530
regardless
of the temperature...

704
00:45:59,432 --> 00:46:01,132
Good afternoon,
Dr. Skirth.

705
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:08,464
The creature
and the host are one.

706
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:09,899
Everything was fine.

707
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:12,732
So, why does the human
continue to waste away?

708
00:46:12,734 --> 00:46:15,731
I don't know. We've given him enough
liquid nutrition to feed an elephant.

709
00:46:15,733 --> 00:46:17,264
But the organism
is unaffected?

710
00:46:17,266 --> 00:46:18,632
- The Symbiote is thriving.
- Good.

711
00:46:18,634 --> 00:46:20,832
But once again,
it's killing the host.

712
00:46:20,834 --> 00:46:21,867
It's consuming his organs.

713
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,533
Oh, watch this.

714
00:46:28,867 --> 00:46:30,531
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
You're hurting it. Stop it!

715
00:46:32,433 --> 00:46:35,431
Sounds in the 4,000 to 6,000 hertz
range are very harmful for it.

716
00:46:35,433 --> 00:46:37,868
- Well, then don't make those sounds.
- Okay.

717
00:46:39,367 --> 00:46:41,164
He was stabilizing.
What happened?

718
00:46:41,166 --> 00:46:42,300
He's approaching
acute liver failure.

719
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,398
We're gonna need another host.

720
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,432
Such poor design.

721
00:46:47,434 --> 00:46:50,264
- Excuse me?
- Human beings.

722
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:51,533
Sorry to interrupt.

723
00:46:54,301 --> 00:46:55,901
Thought you'd like
some good news.

724
00:46:56,133 --> 00:46:57,835
I'm sorry.

725
00:47:08,568 --> 00:47:09,901
<i>Hungry!</i>

726
00:47:10,135 --> 00:47:12,299
Oh, goddamn.

727
00:47:12,301 --> 00:47:14,199
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

728
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:16,399
Can I get through, please?
Excuse me.

729
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:17,699
Thank you.

730
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,265
I'm just gonna stay here,
all right?

731
00:47:19,267 --> 00:47:21,836
Until the cable car stops.

732
00:47:26,769 --> 00:47:28,867
We're good.
All right. Thank you.

733
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:30,868
Excuse me.

734
00:47:36,202 --> 00:47:37,266
Oh, hey, Anne.

735
00:47:37,268 --> 00:47:40,234
Eddie, hi. How you feeling?

736
00:47:40,236 --> 00:47:41,902
Oh, feeling... I'm sick.

737
00:47:42,135 --> 00:47:45,233
Well, Eddie,
you have a parasite.

738
00:47:45,235 --> 00:47:46,869
They're not exactly sure
how you got it,

739
00:47:47,104 --> 00:47:48,834
but it would
explain the fever.

740
00:47:48,836 --> 00:47:50,433
<i>That would make sense.</i>

741
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:54,301
Also, I'm hearing,
uh, a voice.

742
00:47:54,303 --> 00:47:56,200
<i>Auditory hallucinations
are actually very common.</i>

743
00:47:56,202 --> 00:47:57,568
Oh, hey, Dan.
How you doing?

744
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,201
<i>I didn't realize that
you were on the call, too.</i>

745
00:47:59,203 --> 00:48:01,434
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Mmm.

746
00:48:01,436 --> 00:48:03,334
Hey, Dan,
would this parasite...

747
00:48:03,336 --> 00:48:05,267
Would it, like, be able to
make me, I don't know...

748
00:48:05,269 --> 00:48:08,401
Like, climb a really, really,
really tall tree,

749
00:48:08,403 --> 00:48:10,434
but super, super fast?

750
00:48:10,436 --> 00:48:12,201
<i>Yes. We just did.</i>

751
00:48:12,203 --> 00:48:13,568
<i>Uh, well, Eddie,
it sounds like</i>

752
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:15,434
it might be causing
some metabolic abnormalities

753
00:48:15,436 --> 00:48:17,601
that are making it hard for your
body to maintain homeostasis.

754
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,501
You said "causing" and "body,"
and... I lost you.

755
00:48:20,503 --> 00:48:22,468
Listen, Eddie, um, we are
gonna get you on some meds,

756
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:23,801
and we are gonna
clear that out.

757
00:48:23,803 --> 00:48:25,369
- Yes.
- <i>Never gonna happen.</i>

758
00:48:25,371 --> 00:48:27,871
Will you stop doing that now.
Not now.

759
00:48:28,105 --> 00:48:29,768
- Eddie, we're just trying to help you.
- <i>I know.</i>

760
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:32,302
I know. I'm just, I'm not
actually talking to you, Annie.

761
00:48:32,304 --> 00:48:33,769
Who are you talking to?

762
00:48:33,771 --> 00:48:35,669
I'm just gonna call you back,
all right?

763
00:48:35,671 --> 00:48:38,569
Thank you. Thank you, Dan.
Thank you. Thank you, both.

764
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:55,303
Yeah?

765
00:48:55,305 --> 00:48:56,872
Hey, can you turn
your music down, please?

766
00:48:57,105 --> 00:48:58,837
'Cause I'm having
a really hard time.

767
00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:00,336
Whatever.

768
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:05,269
Yeah, sure, man. Yeah.

769
00:49:05,271 --> 00:49:06,472
- I'll just turn it right down. Sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you.

770
00:49:09,705 --> 00:49:12,205
I was troubled by

771
00:49:13,238 --> 00:49:14,838
what we've been doing.

772
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,637
I get it.

773
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:17,905
I get it.

774
00:49:19,171 --> 00:49:20,604
We've all been troubled.

775
00:49:20,606 --> 00:49:23,172
It's the nature
of what we do.

776
00:49:24,805 --> 00:49:27,873
But I need you to tell me
who was here with you.

777
00:49:29,572 --> 00:49:30,872
I need that from you.

778
00:49:33,873 --> 00:49:36,404
I can't do that.

779
00:49:36,406 --> 00:49:39,840
We can't fix things
unless we begin with

780
00:49:40,706 --> 00:49:42,139
your friend.

781
00:49:43,473 --> 00:49:45,204
The person who was here.

782
00:49:45,206 --> 00:49:46,506
Because they're gonna die.
They're in grave danger.

783
00:49:47,506 --> 00:49:49,739
You know that, right?

784
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:52,237
They're gonna die unless
we bring them back here,

785
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,507
where you can help
to keep them alive.

786
00:49:57,539 --> 00:49:59,173
Hey. Dora.

787
00:50:00,773 --> 00:50:03,641
I promise, from here on in,
we will do things differently.

788
00:50:06,874 --> 00:50:08,173
Will you trust me?

789
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:16,705
Eddie Brock.

790
00:50:16,707 --> 00:50:17,874
- Eddie Brock?
- Mmm-hmm.

791
00:50:27,507 --> 00:50:29,208
You were our best.

792
00:50:29,807 --> 00:50:31,539
Open it.

793
00:50:35,675 --> 00:50:36,873
No! No!

794
00:50:36,875 --> 00:50:38,875
No! No! No!

795
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:45,475
<i>Do not open that door.</i>

796
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:48,306
Huh?

797
00:51:00,775 --> 00:51:02,841
Stay put.

798
00:51:02,843 --> 00:51:04,707
- Hey, Eddie.
- <i>Who the hell is this guy?</i>

799
00:51:04,709 --> 00:51:06,909
I'm gonna need
Mr. Drake's property back.

800
00:51:07,175 --> 00:51:08,841
Whoa.

801
00:51:08,843 --> 00:51:11,607
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- I'm, uh...

802
00:51:11,609 --> 00:51:13,307
I'm putting my hands up.

803
00:51:13,309 --> 00:51:15,607
<i>You are making us
look bad.</i>

804
00:51:15,609 --> 00:51:18,574
I...
No, I am not.

805
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:19,876
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

806
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:21,507
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Yes, you are!</i>

807
00:51:21,509 --> 00:51:23,208
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Why would you do that?</i>

808
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:25,207
'Cause it is
a very sensible thing to do.

809
00:51:25,209 --> 00:51:27,407
- Eddie...
- <i>I will take care of this myself.</i>

810
00:51:27,409 --> 00:51:29,307
- What?
- Eddie, where's the bug?

811
00:51:31,111 --> 00:51:31,909
Take him down.

812
00:51:43,276 --> 00:51:44,677
I'm so sorry
about your friends.

813
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:55,877
- What is that?
- <i>Not "what." Who.</i>

814
00:51:57,577 --> 00:51:58,710
Oh.

815
00:52:08,211 --> 00:52:09,211
Shit.

816
00:52:31,112 --> 00:52:33,442
<i>Outstanding.</i>

817
00:52:33,444 --> 00:52:35,476
<i>Now let's bite all their heads off
and pile them up in the corner.</i>

818
00:52:35,478 --> 00:52:36,576
Why would we do that?

819
00:52:36,578 --> 00:52:39,379
<i>Pile of bodies, pile of heads.</i>

820
00:52:46,612 --> 00:52:48,212
What the shit, man?

821
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,812
No! No, no, no!

822
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:04,610
- What the hell?
- Dude! How did you do that?

823
00:53:04,612 --> 00:53:06,879
Apparently, I have a parasite.

824
00:53:15,546 --> 00:53:17,880
Mr. Drake, our subject
is carrying the Symbiote.

825
00:53:18,114 --> 00:53:19,546
<i>Connecting you
to the feed now.</i>

826
00:53:24,713 --> 00:53:26,411
He's achieved symbiosis.

827
00:53:26,413 --> 00:53:27,846
Are you seeing this?

828
00:53:27,848 --> 00:53:29,847
Are you seeing this?
He's achieved symbiosis!

829
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:32,845
Treece...

830
00:53:32,847 --> 00:53:34,848
Treece, bring me back
my creature.

831
00:53:43,314 --> 00:53:44,547
<i>Eddie.</i>

832
00:53:54,214 --> 00:53:56,579
You're not even here, are you?
I'm just seeing things.

833
00:53:56,581 --> 00:53:58,679
It's not real.
You're in my head.

834
00:53:58,681 --> 00:54:00,246
'Cause you're just a parasite.

835
00:54:00,248 --> 00:54:01,281
"Parasite"?

836
00:54:08,482 --> 00:54:10,548
You have a brain tumor, Eddie.

837
00:54:14,382 --> 00:54:16,513
I got him. He's in the alley
behind the Schueller Building.

838
00:54:16,515 --> 00:54:18,313
I am sorry that I
called you a parasite.

839
00:54:18,315 --> 00:54:20,713
We can discuss this
like two men.

840
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,215
What is that? What is that?

841
00:54:30,649 --> 00:54:32,714
What?

842
00:54:32,716 --> 00:54:35,179
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me, Treece?

843
00:54:35,181 --> 00:54:37,713
<i>Copy.
Weapons are armed and ready.</i>

844
00:54:37,715 --> 00:54:38,815
Launch the drones.

845
00:55:08,149 --> 00:55:10,280
<i>Duck.</i>

846
00:55:11,651 --> 00:55:13,281
Whew!

847
00:55:13,283 --> 00:55:15,183
- Thank you.
- <i>You are welcome.</i>

848
00:55:21,217 --> 00:55:23,384
Oh!

849
00:55:31,517 --> 00:55:33,884
This is beyond
anything we thought was possible.

850
00:55:40,718 --> 00:55:42,450
Oh, God, no!

851
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,449
Holy shit!

852
00:56:13,685 --> 00:56:15,717
Treece, do not
let him get away.

853
00:56:15,719 --> 00:56:18,185
I've got him.
All ground vehicles, move in.

854
00:56:24,284 --> 00:56:26,419
Target is now eastbound
on Grant.

855
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:29,219
Oh, God! Do something!

856
00:56:36,753 --> 00:56:37,753
What the...

857
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:46,720
Oh, yeah! We got more friends.
Awesome.

858
00:56:50,886 --> 00:56:51,886
No, no, no! No, no!

859
00:56:55,253 --> 00:56:56,253
No! You're out of your mind!

860
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,654
No!

861
00:57:20,488 --> 00:57:22,454
- That is a dead-end!
- <i>Not for us.</i>

862
00:57:24,154 --> 00:57:26,254
Whoa!

863
00:57:32,421 --> 00:57:33,421
Yeah!

864
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:04,522
Whoa!

865
00:58:11,355 --> 00:58:12,787
I am going to die!

866
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:14,223
<i>You are not
going to die!</i>

867
00:58:26,289 --> 00:58:28,590
Whoa! That was pretty cool,
actually. I'm not gonna lie...

868
00:58:38,124 --> 00:58:39,388
I got him.

869
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,454
- <i>Bring him home.</i>
- Copy that.

870
00:58:40,456 --> 00:58:42,390
This is incredible.

871
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:51,589
You have been a serious
pain in the ass for me, Eddie.

872
00:58:51,591 --> 00:58:54,624
Well, you know,
I aim to please.

873
00:59:06,424 --> 00:59:10,389
Eyes, lungs, pancreas.

874
00:59:10,391 --> 00:59:12,858
So many snacks,
so little time.

875
00:59:23,492 --> 00:59:25,422
SFPD. Don't move!

876
00:59:25,424 --> 00:59:26,591
Get off the car!

877
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:44,393
My legs.

878
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,523
Oh, my God,
my legs were broken.

879
00:59:48,525 --> 00:59:50,925
Now they're not broken.
What is happening?

880
01:00:06,259 --> 01:00:08,190
What the hell
are you?

881
01:00:08,192 --> 01:00:10,658
I am Venom.

882
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:13,424
And you are mine.

883
01:00:13,426 --> 01:00:15,791
You bit somebody's head off.

884
01:00:15,793 --> 01:00:17,859
Fuel in the tank.

885
01:00:17,861 --> 01:00:19,893
Listen carefully, Eddie.

886
01:00:20,128 --> 01:00:22,358
You did not find us.

887
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:24,927
We found you.

888
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:27,191
Think of yourself
as my ride.

889
01:00:27,193 --> 01:00:28,458
Where are you going?

890
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,558
We need
Carlton Drake's rocket.

891
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,525
You remember him.

892
01:00:33,527 --> 01:00:34,924
How do you even know
about that?

893
01:00:34,926 --> 01:00:37,425
- I know everything, Eddie.
- You do?

894
01:00:37,427 --> 01:00:39,258
- Everything about you.
- How?

895
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,692
I am inside your head.

896
01:00:41,694 --> 01:00:44,259
You are a loser, Eddie.

897
01:00:48,827 --> 01:00:51,593
Are you gonna eat
anybody else?

898
01:00:51,595 --> 01:00:52,892
Most likely.

899
01:00:52,894 --> 01:00:54,358
Oh, God.

900
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,359
That is why we are here.

901
01:00:57,361 --> 01:01:00,662
Cooperate,
and you might just survive.

902
01:01:01,828 --> 01:01:03,928
That is the deal.

903
01:01:07,428 --> 01:01:08,760
<i>Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

904
01:01:08,762 --> 01:01:10,660
<i>Welcome to San Francisco.</i>

905
01:01:10,662 --> 01:01:12,561
<i>For your safety and comfort,
please remain seated...</i>

906
01:01:33,595 --> 01:01:35,360
Hey, babe. I'm almost home.

907
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:37,192
- <i>Where's Eddie?</i>
- Why? What's happening?

908
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,262
I got Eddie's labs back,

909
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:42,594
and it's worse than I thought.

910
01:01:42,596 --> 01:01:45,761
His systems, renal, endocrine,
they're behaving abnormally.

911
01:01:45,763 --> 01:01:47,494
<i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

912
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:49,293
What does that mean, Dan?
What are you telling me?

913
01:01:49,295 --> 01:01:50,929
- You need to get him here.
- <i>My God.</i>

914
01:01:54,897 --> 01:01:56,729
- <i>Eddie Brock here. Leave a message.</i>
- Shit.

915
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:06,595
Where were you when
it left Dr. Skirth's body?

916
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:08,762
- Where was he?
- I was...

917
01:02:08,764 --> 01:02:12,764
This is the higher life-form. You
stood by and watched while it died.

918
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:14,830
The arrogance.

919
01:02:20,563 --> 01:02:24,796
Treece, listen to me. After this,
we can't risk killing Brock,

920
01:02:24,798 --> 01:02:26,930
not until we find
another suitable host.

921
01:02:27,164 --> 01:02:31,561
I don't want to see you again
unless you have Brock!

922
01:02:36,264 --> 01:02:38,562
Officer, what's happening?
I need to get in there.

923
01:02:38,564 --> 01:02:40,663
- It's my friend's apartment.
- Building's been evacuated.

924
01:02:40,665 --> 01:02:41,729
It's not safe for you
to be here, ma'am.

925
01:02:41,731 --> 01:02:43,663
Found another one, Bill.

926
01:02:43,665 --> 01:02:45,562
Get off the streets.
Go home.

927
01:02:45,564 --> 01:02:47,262
There's bodies
all over the city tonight.

928
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:48,297
Bodies?

929
01:02:49,731 --> 01:02:51,698
My God, Eddie,
where are you?

930
01:02:54,698 --> 01:02:56,663
<i>Who is Anne?
Your pulse has quickened.</i>

931
01:02:56,665 --> 01:02:58,597
That is none of your
goddamn business.

932
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:00,932
<i>Everything of yours
is my business, Eddie.</i>

933
01:03:01,164 --> 01:03:02,729
<i>We have no secrets.</i>

934
01:03:02,731 --> 01:03:04,363
Yeah? Well, then you know
exactly why I'm going here

935
01:03:04,365 --> 01:03:05,864
before we get to your rocket,
huh?

936
01:03:05,866 --> 01:03:09,397
<i>Sure.
I'm not unreasonable.</i>

937
01:03:09,399 --> 01:03:11,196
Shit. Yeah?

938
01:03:11,198 --> 01:03:12,932
Eddie. Thank God. Where are you?
I need to see you.

939
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:14,897
No, no, you can't see me.

940
01:03:14,899 --> 01:03:17,196
Eddie, I need you to tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

941
01:03:17,198 --> 01:03:18,764
No, you cannot come
anywhere near me.

942
01:03:18,766 --> 01:03:21,331
You cannot come
near me right now.

943
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:22,899
- Richard. Hey, Richard...
- <i>No!</i>

944
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:24,630
- Eddie?
- <i>No, I gotta go up there.</i>

945
01:03:24,632 --> 01:03:25,664
You know you're not
supposed to be here, Eddie.

946
01:03:25,666 --> 01:03:26,932
I got to get up there, man.

947
01:03:27,166 --> 01:03:29,230
Look, I got love for you, bro,
but no can do.

948
01:03:29,232 --> 01:03:30,598
There's no such thing
as can't.

949
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,767
I'm sorry, man.

950
01:03:32,699 --> 01:03:35,197
Okay, okay... Uh...

951
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:37,498
Can you, uh,
just give him this?

952
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,431
- He needs to see what's on it.
- Eddie, please. I really need this job.

953
01:03:40,433 --> 01:03:42,731
- <i>Let's eat his brains.</i>
- No! You do not touch him!

954
01:03:42,733 --> 01:03:44,731
- He is my friend.
- What's wrong with you?

955
01:03:44,733 --> 01:03:46,798
He works three jobs just so
that he can support his family.

956
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,297
- Eddie, what's going on?
- We're leaving.

957
01:03:48,299 --> 01:03:49,831
- <i>"We"?</i>
- Yeah.

958
01:03:49,833 --> 01:03:51,401
- What are you talking about, "we"?
- Just stay back!

959
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,433
Yeah.

960
01:04:01,299 --> 01:04:03,733
- Shit.
- <i>You want up?</i>

961
01:04:07,501 --> 01:04:09,834
<i>Well, why didn't you just say?</i>

962
01:04:20,634 --> 01:04:22,934
Hmm.

963
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:26,365
- It is peaceful up here.
- <i>I'm not very good with heights.</i>

964
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:30,566
Your world is not so ugly
after all.

965
01:04:30,568 --> 01:04:32,902
I'm almost sorry
to see it end.

966
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:34,299
<i>What does that mean?</i>

967
01:04:42,568 --> 01:04:44,265
Where'd you go?
Where did you go?

968
01:04:55,168 --> 01:04:56,566
<i>I got us.</i>

969
01:04:56,568 --> 01:04:57,669
Whoa.

970
01:05:03,137 --> 01:05:06,701
Again?
You're gonna get me killed.

971
01:05:06,703 --> 01:05:08,834
<i>You die, I die.</i>

972
01:05:08,836 --> 01:05:11,234
Yeah, well, you can always
just shed my carcass

973
01:05:11,236 --> 01:05:13,734
and exchange it for another
one whenever you need.

974
01:05:13,736 --> 01:05:15,634
<i>Why would I do that?</i>

975
01:05:15,636 --> 01:05:18,634
<i>You are far too good of a
match to throw away so soon.</i>

976
01:05:18,636 --> 01:05:20,801
<i>Plus, I am starting
to like you.</i>

977
01:05:20,803 --> 01:05:22,269
<i>You and I
are not so different.</i>

978
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:23,936
Thank you.

979
01:05:27,803 --> 01:05:28,836
Okay.

980
01:05:30,804 --> 01:05:32,302
Here's your evidence.

981
01:05:36,236 --> 01:05:37,436
<i>Jump.</i>

982
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:41,602
<i>Pussy.</i>

983
01:05:51,704 --> 01:05:52,837
Hands!

984
01:05:54,771 --> 01:05:56,504
On the ground! Now!

985
01:06:00,905 --> 01:06:03,735
Guys, you do not want to do this.
Trust me.

986
01:06:03,737 --> 01:06:05,802
- Mask!
- Copy!

987
01:06:05,804 --> 01:06:08,301
All right,
have it your own way.

988
01:06:08,303 --> 01:06:09,938
- Mask!
- <i>Copy.</i>

989
01:06:10,171 --> 01:06:11,703
What the hell
is that thing?

990
01:06:17,304 --> 01:06:18,471
What the hell?

991
01:06:19,705 --> 01:06:21,302
Hold your fire!

992
01:06:21,304 --> 01:06:23,436
Flares!

993
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:24,536
He's there!
He's there!

994
01:06:24,538 --> 01:06:25,738
Reload!

995
01:06:26,838 --> 01:06:28,569
Anybody see him?

996
01:06:39,471 --> 01:06:41,404
Does anyone have eyes on him?

997
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:45,239
<i>Switching to
thermal. Seeking target.</i>

998
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:00,570
I don't have
eyes on him.

999
01:07:02,272 --> 01:07:03,339
Where is it?

1000
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:11,438
Flash grenade!

1001
01:07:12,707 --> 01:07:13,838
Throw them!

1002
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,370
Flash grenade!

1003
01:07:26,407 --> 01:07:27,672
He's in the rafters!

1004
01:07:27,674 --> 01:07:28,738
Above!

1005
01:07:34,174 --> 01:07:35,206
There he is!

1006
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,274
Move, move, move!

1007
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:12,906
<i>No! We do not
eat policemen!</i>

1008
01:08:19,275 --> 01:08:20,774
Annie! Annie, wait!

1009
01:08:20,776 --> 01:08:22,606
- Wait, please.
- Oh, what the hell is that?

1010
01:08:22,608 --> 01:08:25,273
That's not me.
I've been infected.

1011
01:08:25,275 --> 01:08:27,740
- Eddie, what's happening?
- He's inside me.

1012
01:08:27,742 --> 01:08:29,340
- "He"?
- Yes.

1013
01:08:29,342 --> 01:08:31,774
- I know it sounds crazy, but...
- You're sick.

1014
01:08:31,776 --> 01:08:34,475
- Eddie, you're really sick.
- No, I am scared!

1015
01:08:36,842 --> 01:08:39,542
- And I need help.
- Hospital.

1016
01:08:43,308 --> 01:08:44,308
Right now.

1017
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:50,306
I can't go with you.
It's not safe.

1018
01:08:50,308 --> 01:08:51,375
Get in the car, Eddie.

1019
01:08:53,476 --> 01:08:56,543
- In the back.
- <i>I like her. Get in.</i>

1020
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:05,710
I'm out of control.

1021
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:08,876
Dan just needs to do
another MRI.

1022
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:10,710
- <i>No MRI.</i>
- No. No. No MRI.

1023
01:09:11,411 --> 01:09:12,910
What? Why?

1024
01:09:13,144 --> 01:09:15,241
<i>Sound at 4,000
to 6,000 hertz is lethal.</i>

1025
01:09:16,810 --> 01:09:20,575
Sound frequency in the MRI
is really harmful for him.

1026
01:09:20,577 --> 01:09:23,375
What, so, sound
is like his kryptonite?

1027
01:09:23,377 --> 01:09:25,944
- Not all sounds.
- <i>And fire.</i>

1028
01:09:26,176 --> 01:09:29,210
Fire. And fire.
He's talking to you?

1029
01:09:30,811 --> 01:09:32,244
Always.

1030
01:09:33,344 --> 01:09:35,510
- Are you in pain?
- No.

1031
01:09:35,512 --> 01:09:38,208
No, I don't feel anything,
actually, apart from...

1032
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:40,509
I'm hungry all the time.

1033
01:09:40,511 --> 01:09:43,845
<i>And you feel sad, do you
not, Eddie, when you are with her?</i>

1034
01:09:45,146 --> 01:09:46,842
Get out of my head, man.

1035
01:09:46,844 --> 01:09:49,309
<i>You never apologized.</i>

1036
01:09:49,311 --> 01:09:51,912
<i>You might not live
to get another chance.</i>

1037
01:09:57,779 --> 01:09:59,609
Annie.

1038
01:09:59,611 --> 01:10:03,276
I just want to say
that whatever happens,

1039
01:10:03,278 --> 01:10:09,276
that I am truly sorry for whatever...
And everything I have ever done to you.

1040
01:10:09,278 --> 01:10:10,879
I am truly, truly sorry.

1041
01:10:12,278 --> 01:10:14,345
And that I love you.

1042
01:10:14,913 --> 01:10:17,543
Oh, Eddie...

1043
01:10:17,545 --> 01:10:20,644
Now's really not the time. Let's
just keep you alive, okay?

1044
01:10:20,646 --> 01:10:23,277
<i>Aw, that's nice.</i>

1045
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:31,377
You know, I'm really wet and
cold. Can I, uh, wear this?

1046
01:10:31,379 --> 01:10:34,577
Yeah, yeah, you can wear
whatever you want.

1047
01:10:34,579 --> 01:10:35,646
Thank you.

1048
01:10:54,247 --> 01:10:55,280
Hello?

1049
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,815
What are you doing here?

1050
01:11:11,514 --> 01:11:12,515
Are you lost?

1051
01:11:14,681 --> 01:11:16,681
I'm not lost.

1052
01:11:24,248 --> 01:11:25,746
Thanks for coming in.

1053
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:29,246
- Eddie, I'm sorry.
- What?

1054
01:11:29,248 --> 01:11:31,914
Eddie, I got your labs back, and
your heart has atrophied severely.

1055
01:11:32,149 --> 01:11:34,646
<i>Do not listen to him.
I can fix it.</i>

1056
01:11:34,648 --> 01:11:35,948
I don't want you to fix it.

1057
01:11:36,181 --> 01:11:37,513
<i>I can heal you.</i>

1058
01:11:39,715 --> 01:11:41,414
Can you fix it?

1059
01:11:41,416 --> 01:11:43,346
No. I've never seen
anything like this before.

1060
01:11:43,348 --> 01:11:45,546
- This parasite, whatever this is...
- <i>"Parasite"?</i>

1061
01:11:45,548 --> 01:11:46,846
It's eating you
from the inside.

1062
01:11:46,848 --> 01:11:48,480
Not a parasite.
He's not.

1063
01:11:48,482 --> 01:11:50,580
- You're using him up.
- <i>No. She is wrong.</i>

1064
01:11:50,582 --> 01:11:53,613
- We need to get you to the ICU.
- Wait. Shh!

1065
01:11:53,615 --> 01:11:56,212
- I, Eddie, am I dying?
- <i>No!</i>

1066
01:11:56,214 --> 01:11:57,814
You're killing him.

1067
01:11:57,816 --> 01:11:59,280
<i>They do not know
what they are talking about.</i>

1068
01:11:59,282 --> 01:12:00,846
Listen,
we don't have a lot of time...

1069
01:12:00,848 --> 01:12:02,380
- Oh, God!
- <i>We have to get out of here.</i>

1070
01:12:03,716 --> 01:12:04,781
- Stop!
- Oh, God, he's killing you.

1071
01:12:04,783 --> 01:12:05,916
I'm killing you.
I'm so sorry.

1072
01:12:08,482 --> 01:12:11,482
No! Don't do that!

1073
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:29,681
Are you all right? Eddie, I'm sorry.
I had to get him out of you.

1074
01:12:29,683 --> 01:12:30,950
What is that?

1075
01:12:37,917 --> 01:12:40,882
You were killing me?

1076
01:12:40,884 --> 01:12:43,950
What happened to "we," man?
What happened to "we"?

1077
01:12:45,784 --> 01:12:50,450
Yeah, look at you now, huh?
Now you're dying, too.

1078
01:12:51,684 --> 01:12:52,817
We're done.

1079
01:12:55,183 --> 01:12:57,549
- Where do you think you're going?
- Anywhere other than here.

1080
01:12:57,551 --> 01:12:59,315
You don't think we have
a little problem on our hands?

1081
01:12:59,317 --> 01:13:01,317
Wait, you're not gonna
leave me here with this thing.

1082
01:13:04,250 --> 01:13:05,783
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

1083
01:13:05,785 --> 01:13:09,683
I do. And you're right.
We do need to talk about it,

1084
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:11,916
but I don't know
much more than you do.

1085
01:13:11,918 --> 01:13:14,884
I guess he had
no one else to turn to.

1086
01:13:14,886 --> 01:13:18,616
He's a very complicated man.
But, Dan, I promise,

1087
01:13:18,618 --> 01:13:20,349
there's nothing going on
between me and Eddie.

1088
01:13:20,351 --> 01:13:22,482
I'm not talking
about you and Eddie, Anne.

1089
01:13:22,484 --> 01:13:23,751
- Oh.
- I'm talking about that.

1090
01:13:27,552 --> 01:13:28,551
Dan.

1091
01:13:35,384 --> 01:13:36,618
Where is it?

1092
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,520
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

1093
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:34,317
You can kill me,
'cause I'm dying anyway.

1094
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:38,918
I'm not just gonna kill you.
That wouldn't be any fun.

1095
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:42,954
No, no, no. I'm gonna rip your
tongue out of your face.

1096
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:45,485
Whoo!

1097
01:14:47,155 --> 01:14:50,820
Stop. You're bleeding
all over my lab. Go. Go!

1098
01:15:00,388 --> 01:15:02,453
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1099
01:15:02,455 --> 01:15:05,485
And you know what? Even if I
did, I wouldn't tell you anyway.

1100
01:15:05,487 --> 01:15:09,386
I don't trust you,
and you're insane.

1101
01:15:09,388 --> 01:15:11,318
- That hurts.
- Sorry.

1102
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,787
Long journal entry
about that tonight.

1103
01:15:12,789 --> 01:15:14,553
You're being dumb, Brock.
I'm not insane.

1104
01:15:14,555 --> 01:15:17,720
What's insane is the way
humans choose to live today.

1105
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:20,286
Think about it.
All we do is take, take, take.

1106
01:15:20,288 --> 01:15:21,720
It can't go on.

1107
01:15:21,722 --> 01:15:24,254
We've brought the planet
to the brink of extinction.

1108
01:15:24,256 --> 01:15:26,253
We're parasites.
You're a good example.

1109
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:27,923
Think about it.
All you do is take.

1110
01:15:28,156 --> 01:15:31,853
You took my Symbiote. You
take potshots at a great man

1111
01:15:31,855 --> 01:15:33,654
- trying to get something done.
- Who?

1112
01:15:35,588 --> 01:15:37,853
Didn't you take from the
person you loved the most,

1113
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:40,354
who trusted you the most?
That's insane.

1114
01:15:40,356 --> 01:15:44,854
What I've initiated is a whole
new world, a new species.

1115
01:15:44,856 --> 01:15:47,287
Man and Symbiote combined.

1116
01:15:47,289 --> 01:15:49,854
Let me tell you something, buddy.
All right? Just man-to-man.

1117
01:15:49,856 --> 01:15:52,921
Because I have spent a significant
amount of time, all right,

1118
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:56,320
with one of these creatures
up my ass.

1119
01:15:56,322 --> 01:15:57,621
It's not a lot of fun.

1120
01:15:57,623 --> 01:16:00,221
And then I find out,
all along,

1121
01:16:00,223 --> 01:16:01,622
that they're killing you.

1122
01:16:01,624 --> 01:16:03,354
This is the last time
I'm asking you.

1123
01:16:03,356 --> 01:16:05,889
- Where is my Symbiote?
- I have no idea.

1124
01:16:05,891 --> 01:16:08,422
- Where is he?
- Oh, my God!

1125
01:16:08,424 --> 01:16:09,924
Where's Venom?

1126
01:16:10,157 --> 01:16:13,721
That is the ugliest-looking
thing I have ever seen.

1127
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:23,588
You know, Brock,
I have no use for you.

1128
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:26,255
Treece! Come and clean up
your mess.

1129
01:16:26,257 --> 01:16:30,488
Whoa, he has one
up his ass, too.

1130
01:16:38,725 --> 01:16:43,925
Your friends, the others, I apologize.
I tried to keep them alive.

1131
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:47,556
There are more of us.
Millions more.

1132
01:16:47,558 --> 01:16:49,758
They will follow
wherever I lead.

1133
01:16:51,792 --> 01:16:53,556
Where we lead.

1134
01:16:53,558 --> 01:16:55,289
Yes, "we."

1135
01:16:55,291 --> 01:16:58,558
But first,
we must retrieve them.

1136
01:16:59,925 --> 01:17:01,492
I can take care of that.

1137
01:17:06,525 --> 01:17:09,524
Yeah, what you gonna do,
you gonna walk me to death?

1138
01:17:09,526 --> 01:17:10,526
Shut up.

1139
01:17:14,359 --> 01:17:15,959
Not so tough
without your friend.

1140
01:17:20,859 --> 01:17:22,526
Did your mama not love you?

1141
01:17:25,427 --> 01:17:26,891
God damn it!

1142
01:17:28,759 --> 01:17:31,924
I guess it
pays to be a specialist, huh?

1143
01:17:31,926 --> 01:17:33,925
You know, it doesn't matter
if you kill me anyway,

1144
01:17:33,927 --> 01:17:35,691
because there's something
way bigger afoot

1145
01:17:35,693 --> 01:17:36,759
in this world than you and me.

1146
01:17:37,693 --> 01:17:39,925
Much bigger than me.

1147
01:17:39,927 --> 01:17:44,427
And it's much,
much bigger than you.

1148
01:17:46,794 --> 01:17:48,625
Karma's a bitch.

1149
01:17:48,627 --> 01:17:49,860
I don't believe in karma.

1150
01:17:51,593 --> 01:17:53,593
Oh! Ooh!

1151
01:17:58,293 --> 01:17:59,358
Hi, Eddie.

1152
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:01,392
Whoa. Whoa...

1153
01:18:01,394 --> 01:18:04,224
Oh...

1154
01:18:04,226 --> 01:18:05,226
Mmm...

1155
01:18:06,261 --> 01:18:07,461
Mmm!

1156
01:18:23,695 --> 01:18:24,861
Oh, no.

1157
01:18:26,461 --> 01:18:28,859
I just bit
that guy's head off.

1158
01:18:28,861 --> 01:18:31,360
I know, I know. I've been there, too.
It's not fun.

1159
01:18:31,362 --> 01:18:33,961
- <i>The one with Drake is Riot.</i>
- Who's Riot?

1160
01:18:34,194 --> 01:18:36,693
<i>Riot is what you would call
a team leader.</i>

1161
01:18:36,695 --> 01:18:38,759
<i>He has an arsenal of weapons.</i>

1162
01:18:38,761 --> 01:18:40,962
- Drake's got his own Symbiote.
- <i>He is unstoppable.</i>

1163
01:18:41,194 --> 01:18:42,759
- Oh, great.
- <i>We have got to go!</i>

1164
01:18:42,761 --> 01:18:44,460
Go where? Where we going?

1165
01:18:44,462 --> 01:18:45,894
- Well, I'm coming with you.
- <i>No!</i>

1166
01:18:45,896 --> 01:18:47,794
<i>It's going to get ugly.</i>

1167
01:18:47,796 --> 01:18:49,896
- Well, she can fight ugly. Trust me.
- Yeah, I can fight ugly.

1168
01:18:51,662 --> 01:18:53,228
Not today.

1169
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:56,295
Oh, that's bullshit!

1170
01:18:58,462 --> 01:18:59,962
This is not a simulation.

1171
01:19:00,196 --> 01:19:02,360
Well, the flight team
aren't prepped yet.

1172
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:04,795
I'll be piloting
the spacecraft.

1173
01:19:04,797 --> 01:19:06,527
- You?
- Yes, me.

1174
01:19:06,529 --> 01:19:08,227
How long?

1175
01:19:08,229 --> 01:19:09,927
We're loading the probe
and running diagnostics.

1176
01:19:09,929 --> 01:19:13,296
But even fully automated, you
can't pilot that craft all alone.

1177
01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:16,630
I'm not alone.

1178
01:19:20,263 --> 01:19:23,561
God damn it! What the hell
happened there? We just left Annie.

1179
01:19:23,563 --> 01:19:25,528
<i>It is not safe for her.</i>

1180
01:19:25,530 --> 01:19:26,930
<i>If we do not stop Riot,</i>

1181
01:19:27,164 --> 01:19:30,561
<i>he will come back here
with millions more of my kind.</i>

1182
01:19:30,563 --> 01:19:34,929
Millions? What, you were
gonna take the rocket,

1183
01:19:34,931 --> 01:19:36,963
and you were gonna come back
here with an invasion force?

1184
01:19:37,197 --> 01:19:38,895
Then what were you gonna do,
you were gonna go feed

1185
01:19:38,897 --> 01:19:40,662
- on a whole planet?
- <i>Yes!</i>

1186
01:19:40,664 --> 01:19:42,862
<i>But it is
different now, Eddie.</i>

1187
01:19:42,864 --> 01:19:45,429
- <i>I have decided to stay.</i>
- Wow!

1188
01:19:45,431 --> 01:19:48,461
<i>On my planet, I am
kind of a loser, like you.</i>

1189
01:19:48,463 --> 01:19:50,964
- <i>But here, we could be more.</i>
- Excuse me?

1190
01:19:51,197 --> 01:19:52,929
<i>And I'm getting to
like it here.</i>

1191
01:19:52,931 --> 01:19:55,595
Oh, you like us now,
do you, huh?

1192
01:19:55,597 --> 01:19:58,228
<i>However, there will be nothing left to
like if we do not stop that rocket.</i>

1193
01:19:58,230 --> 01:20:01,964
Oh, I see. Right. When it comes
to being completely annihilated,

1194
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,328
- then it's back to "we."
- <i>It is "we."</i>

1195
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:06,729
<i>Like it or not, it is
going to take both of us.</i>

1196
01:20:06,731 --> 01:20:08,430
Hey, come on, man.
Cut the bullshit.

1197
01:20:08,432 --> 01:20:09,898
What really made you
change your mind?

1198
01:20:13,698 --> 01:20:16,665
You. You did, Eddie.

1199
01:20:18,665 --> 01:20:21,329
Scrub diagnostics.

1200
01:20:21,331 --> 01:20:23,699
- Sir?
- Did you hear me? Initiate the launch.

1201
01:20:30,398 --> 01:20:33,463
<i>T-minus
five minutes to launch.</i>

1202
01:20:33,465 --> 01:20:35,799
<i>Auto sequence has been
initiated.</i>

1203
01:20:48,498 --> 01:20:49,866
Oh, shit.

1204
01:20:59,433 --> 01:21:02,366
<i>T-minus
four minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1205
01:21:09,833 --> 01:21:13,597
<i>Oh, Jesus!
You can take this guy, right?</i>

1206
01:21:13,599 --> 01:21:16,297
He has got shit
you have never seen.

1207
01:21:16,299 --> 01:21:18,397
<i>What does that mean?
What are our chances?</i>

1208
01:21:18,399 --> 01:21:21,831
Hmm. Pretty much zero.

1209
01:21:21,833 --> 01:21:24,734
<i>Oh, fuck it. Well,
let's go save the planet.</i>

1210
01:21:27,734 --> 01:21:29,834
<i>T-minus four minutes.</i>

1211
01:21:33,534 --> 01:21:36,333
<i>Initiate orbiter
aerosurface profile.</i>

1212
01:21:39,601 --> 01:21:42,432
Venom. Get in the rocket.

1213
01:21:42,434 --> 01:21:46,566
No. We won't let you destroy
this world.

1214
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:47,900
Then die.

1215
01:21:58,635 --> 01:22:00,633
- <i>Holy shit!</i>
- Told you.

1216
01:22:00,635 --> 01:22:02,268
<i>T-minus three minutes.</i>

1217
01:22:14,702 --> 01:22:16,234
You have a strong host.

1218
01:22:18,501 --> 01:22:19,835
But not strong enough.

1219
01:22:58,570 --> 01:23:01,300
<i>T-minus
two minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1220
01:23:03,503 --> 01:23:04,637
Eddie.

1221
01:23:09,171 --> 01:23:10,537
Drake, stop!

1222
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:19,206
Told you I could fight ugly.

1223
01:24:26,339 --> 01:24:28,640
<i>T-minus one minute.</i>

1224
01:24:46,607 --> 01:24:48,304
You're too late.

1225
01:24:48,306 --> 01:24:49,306
This is the next stage...

1226
01:24:51,374 --> 01:24:53,607
You talk too much.

1227
01:25:03,207 --> 01:25:04,940
<i>T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

1228
01:25:05,175 --> 01:25:06,808
You are nothing.

1229
01:25:35,442 --> 01:25:36,742
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

1230
01:25:37,508 --> 01:25:38,642
<i>Nine...</i>

1231
01:25:39,475 --> 01:25:40,542
<i>Eight...</i>

1232
01:25:41,475 --> 01:25:42,475
<i>Seven...</i>

1233
01:25:43,241 --> 01:25:44,241
<i>Six...</i>

1234
01:25:44,775 --> 01:25:45,809
<i>Five...</i>

1235
01:25:46,609 --> 01:25:48,239
<i>Four...</i>

1236
01:25:48,241 --> 01:25:49,773
<i>Three...</i>

1237
01:25:49,775 --> 01:25:51,640
<i>Two...</i>

1238
01:25:51,642 --> 01:25:53,643
<i>One...</i>

1239
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:56,608
<i>Liftoff.</i>

1240
01:26:03,943 --> 01:26:05,574
Traitor!

1241
01:26:05,576 --> 01:26:07,341
Have a nice life.

1242
01:26:33,609 --> 01:26:34,976
<i>Goodbye, Eddie.</i>

1243
01:26:36,243 --> 01:26:37,677
Venom, no!

1244
01:27:25,678 --> 01:27:29,644
Thanks for sticking by me, Annie.
Thanks for saving me.

1245
01:27:29,646 --> 01:27:31,242
So, how you feeling
after all that?

1246
01:27:31,244 --> 01:27:32,979
I feel great. Awesome.

1247
01:27:33,212 --> 01:27:34,978
Wow.

1248
01:27:35,212 --> 01:27:36,877
Yeah, I'm thinking of suing, though.
You want to prosecute?

1249
01:27:36,879 --> 01:27:40,377
Hmm. You're in luck. I've
decided to work pro bono.

1250
01:27:40,379 --> 01:27:42,377
I'm joining
the public defenders' office.

1251
01:27:42,379 --> 01:27:44,342
You're a good person, Annie.

1252
01:27:44,344 --> 01:27:45,844
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

1253
01:27:45,846 --> 01:27:47,677
Uh, the network asked me
to bring the show back,

1254
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:49,711
and they want to start
with a piece on Drake.

1255
01:27:49,713 --> 01:27:51,811
Oh, wow, really?
So, what did you say?

1256
01:27:51,813 --> 01:27:56,244
Uh, I'm not into it. I want to
concentrate on the written word.

1257
01:27:56,246 --> 01:27:58,344
I scored the interview
of a lifetime.

1258
01:27:58,346 --> 01:28:00,678
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- You're gonna have to read it.

1259
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:03,311
Oh! Like everyone else.

1260
01:28:03,313 --> 01:28:04,313
Yeah.

1261
01:28:06,747 --> 01:28:08,980
Hey, I'm sorry about Venom.

1262
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:11,879
Hey, um...

1263
01:28:14,547 --> 01:28:16,378
Do you want to talk
about that kiss?

1264
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:19,580
Oh, that? You call that a kiss...
No, that was...

1265
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:24,946
Uh, that was your
buddy's idea.

1266
01:28:24,948 --> 01:28:27,347
Oh, right. Well,
that is good to know.

1267
01:28:29,847 --> 01:28:32,214
- It did feel kind of great, though.
- What?

1268
01:28:32,847 --> 01:28:34,279
I mean, the...

1269
01:28:34,281 --> 01:28:37,813
- The power?
- Yeah. When it's, you know...

1270
01:28:37,815 --> 01:28:39,379
- Inside you?
- You know what I mean.

1271
01:28:39,381 --> 01:28:40,481
Okay.

1272
01:28:41,781 --> 01:28:43,379
- Hey, Eddie?
- Mmm-hmm?

1273
01:28:43,381 --> 01:28:45,612
We're not gonna
tell Dan about this. Okay?

1274
01:28:45,614 --> 01:28:49,345
<i>Look at her. She has no
idea we are going to get her back.</i>

1275
01:28:49,347 --> 01:28:52,279
No, I don't think so.

1276
01:28:52,281 --> 01:28:54,746
- Sorry, what was that?
- We're not gonna tell Dan.

1277
01:28:54,748 --> 01:28:56,546
Eddie, is there something
you want to tell me?

1278
01:28:56,548 --> 01:28:58,948
- Nope.
- <i>You belong with us, Annie.</i>

1279
01:28:59,182 --> 01:29:00,714
Eddie, are you sure?

1280
01:29:00,716 --> 01:29:02,713
Good Lord, look at that.

1281
01:29:02,715 --> 01:29:04,848
- Look at the time.
- I have to go.

1282
01:29:06,615 --> 01:29:08,780
- Hey, it's nice seeing you.
- Yeah.

1283
01:29:08,782 --> 01:29:10,915
You take care, all right?

1284
01:29:11,183 --> 01:29:12,982
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.
- Bye.

1285
01:29:16,916 --> 01:29:20,346
Hey. Don't give up on her.

1286
01:29:20,348 --> 01:29:21,515
Either of you.

1287
01:29:22,248 --> 01:29:23,613
We won't.

1288
01:29:23,615 --> 01:29:25,313
- <i>Who is that guy?</i>
- Okay.

1289
01:29:25,315 --> 01:29:27,880
<i>Wait.
This thing looks delicious.</i>

1290
01:29:27,882 --> 01:29:30,547
I have absolutely no problem
with you sticking around,

1291
01:29:30,549 --> 01:29:33,480
but if you do, we're gonna have to
have some ground rules, all right?

1292
01:29:33,482 --> 01:29:37,246
You cannot just go around eating
anybody that you want to.

1293
01:29:37,248 --> 01:29:38,983
- <i>I cannot?</i>
- No, you cannot.

1294
01:29:39,216 --> 01:29:40,914
All right, we need to...
We need to reiterate this.

1295
01:29:40,916 --> 01:29:44,481
There are good people
in this world, a lot of them.

1296
01:29:44,483 --> 01:29:46,781
And then there are bad people.

1297
01:29:46,783 --> 01:29:48,648
You have to tell
the difference.

1298
01:29:48,650 --> 01:29:52,514
The deal is, you will only
ever be allowed to touch,

1299
01:29:52,516 --> 01:29:55,881
harm, hurt, possibly,
very possibly,

1300
01:29:55,883 --> 01:29:58,314
eat very, very bad people,

1301
01:29:58,316 --> 01:30:00,983
but never, ever,
ever good people. All right?

1302
01:30:01,216 --> 01:30:03,581
- <i>Fine.</i>
- Good.

1303
01:30:03,583 --> 01:30:05,348
<i>But how does one
tell the difference?</i>

1304
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:07,448
Well, it's super simple.

1305
01:30:07,450 --> 01:30:10,348
I mean, you just have to... You
can intuit it, you can sense it.

1306
01:30:10,350 --> 01:30:12,415
Sometimes you can
even feel it.

1307
01:30:12,417 --> 01:30:13,849
<i>Whatever you say.</i>

1308
01:30:13,851 --> 01:30:15,916
<i>But can we get something to
eat now?</i>

1309
01:30:15,918 --> 01:30:21,347
<i>Otherwise, your liver, it's starting
to look really, really good and juicy.</i>

1310
01:30:21,349 --> 01:30:23,651
Yeah. Definitely.
I know a place down here.

1311
01:30:25,217 --> 01:30:27,517
Hey, Mrs. C.

1312
01:30:28,584 --> 01:30:30,282
How you doing, Eddie?

1313
01:30:30,284 --> 01:30:31,850
Ain't nothing changed
but the weather. You know.

1314
01:30:31,852 --> 01:30:34,816
No.

1315
01:30:34,818 --> 01:30:37,952
So, what culinary delights will
tickle the pickle tonight?

1316
01:30:38,185 --> 01:30:39,849
<i>Tater tots
and chocolate.</i>

1317
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:41,516
Right. Okay, no problem.

1318
01:30:42,785 --> 01:30:44,350
The payment's due, Chen.

1319
01:30:45,852 --> 01:30:47,849
Please.
I can't keep doing this.

1320
01:30:47,851 --> 01:30:49,416
Now.

1321
01:30:49,418 --> 01:30:50,985
- <i>Bad guy, right?</i>
- Yep.

1322
01:30:58,518 --> 01:31:00,583
You come in here again...

1323
01:31:00,585 --> 01:31:05,249
In fact, you go anywhere in this
city, preying on innocent people,

1324
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:08,750
and we will find you
and eat both your arms

1325
01:31:08,752 --> 01:31:10,750
- and then both of your legs.
- No, no.

1326
01:31:10,752 --> 01:31:13,818
And then we will eat your face right
off your head. Do you understand?

1327
01:31:13,820 --> 01:31:15,718
- Please...
- Yes.

1328
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:19,617
So, you will be this armless,
legless, faceless thing, won't you,

1329
01:31:19,619 --> 01:31:24,384
rolling down the street,
like a turd in the wind?

1330
01:31:24,386 --> 01:31:26,753
- Do you feel me?
- What the hell are you?

1331
01:31:28,653 --> 01:31:31,219
We are Venom.

1332
01:31:32,753 --> 01:31:34,820
- On second thought...
- Please.

1333
01:31:41,886 --> 01:31:44,284
Eddie? What was that?

1334
01:31:44,286 --> 01:31:45,684
Oh...

1335
01:31:45,686 --> 01:31:49,487
I have a parasite. Yeah.
Night, Mrs. Chen.

1336
01:31:50,821 --> 01:31:52,351
- <i>"Parasite"?</i>
- Yeah.

1337
01:31:52,353 --> 01:31:54,351
It's a term of endearment,
that's all.

1338
01:31:54,353 --> 01:31:56,351
- <i>Apologize!</i>
- No.

1339
01:31:56,353 --> 01:31:59,285
- <i>Apologize!</i>
- All right, fine.

1340
01:31:59,287 --> 01:32:01,988
I'm sorry. So, what do you
want to do now?

1341
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:06,351
<i>The way I see it,
we can do whatever we want.</i>

1342
01:34:33,492 --> 01:34:35,423
I need you
to stay quiet.

1343
01:34:35,425 --> 01:34:38,390
This is a "me" thing.
It is not a "we" thing.

1344
01:34:38,392 --> 01:34:41,525
- You got that?
- <i>Fine, but make it quick.</i>

1345
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:47,424
Open on five.

1346
01:34:47,426 --> 01:34:50,558
Go. Opening up.

1347
01:34:52,625 --> 01:34:55,324
You ask me, they're dumb
to let him call the shots.

1348
01:34:55,326 --> 01:34:57,858
Second he asked
for you to interview him,

1349
01:34:57,860 --> 01:34:59,590
I'd have shut that
shit down.

1350
01:34:59,592 --> 01:35:01,758
Oh, yeah, you know the FBI.
They're just taking advantage

1351
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,391
of the one and only time
he'll ever speak to anyone.

1352
01:35:04,393 --> 01:35:07,524
They're hoping that I might help them
identify some additional bodies.

1353
01:35:07,526 --> 01:35:10,960
FBI don't work up close
and personal with him.

1354
01:35:11,194 --> 01:35:14,660
The FBI will have to identify you,
if you don't follow the rules.

1355
01:35:17,727 --> 01:35:20,627
Hey, Red!
I got a visitor for you.

1356
01:35:40,761 --> 01:35:43,392
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

1357
01:35:43,394 --> 01:35:47,826
Do you mind if we forego the whole
creepy serial killer thing here?

1358
01:35:47,828 --> 01:35:48,994
Sure, it's good with me.

1359
01:35:49,227 --> 01:35:51,559
I mean, I can turn it on
if you want.

1360
01:35:51,561 --> 01:35:58,425
I can talk about the Dadaist
patterns of arterial spray.

1361
01:35:58,427 --> 01:36:00,493
I bet you can.

1362
01:36:00,495 --> 01:36:02,962
Tough to see you
in this light, Eddie.

1363
01:36:03,795 --> 01:36:04,829
Come on over.

1364
01:36:05,795 --> 01:36:07,261
All right.

1365
01:36:12,295 --> 01:36:13,593
I'm here.

1366
01:36:13,595 --> 01:36:17,327
When I get out of here,
and I will,

1367
01:36:18,662 --> 01:36:20,629
there's gonna be carnage.

1368
01:48:30,419 --> 01:48:32,585
I'm sorry, Mr. Parker.

1369
01:48:34,285 --> 01:48:36,350
I want to do what you asked.

1370
01:48:36,352 --> 01:48:37,984
I really do.

1371
01:48:37,986 --> 01:48:40,283
But... I'm sorry.

1372
01:48:44,552 --> 01:48:46,951
I can't do this without you.

1373
01:48:48,419 --> 01:48:49,484
Hey, kid...

1374
01:48:49,486 --> 01:48:50,784
Whoa.

1375
01:48:50,786 --> 01:48:51,786
What was... Whoa!

1376
01:48:55,652 --> 01:48:56,652
What?

1377
01:48:58,687 --> 01:48:59,720
Huh?

1378
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:09,320
No.

1379
01:49:13,587 --> 01:49:15,519
Who are you?

1380
01:49:15,521 --> 01:49:16,520
What are you
doing over there?

1381
01:49:17,755 --> 01:49:19,685
Freeze! PDNY.

1382
01:49:19,687 --> 01:49:21,685
Kid, freeze!

1383
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:26,453
You're kidding me right now?

1384
01:49:28,521 --> 01:49:29,921
Hey, kid.
Drop the body.

1385
01:49:38,921 --> 01:49:40,319
Ow!

1386
01:49:40,321 --> 01:49:41,521
Somebody stop that train!

1387
01:49:53,955 --> 01:49:55,022
Aah!

1388
01:50:03,956 --> 01:50:05,453
Sorry.

1389
01:50:14,555 --> 01:50:16,920
<i>...looks like
a child dressed like Spider-Man,</i>

1390
01:50:16,922 --> 01:50:18,453
<i>dragging a homeless corpse</i>

1391
01:50:18,455 --> 01:50:19,754
<i>behind a train.</i>

1392
01:50:19,756 --> 01:50:20,989
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

1393
01:50:21,224 --> 01:50:22,554
Why are you
trying to kill me?

1394
01:50:22,556 --> 01:50:23,954
I'm not.
I'm trying to save you.

1395
01:50:43,556 --> 01:50:46,755
Hey, maybe you guys
can go around?

1396
01:50:46,757 --> 01:50:49,289
All right.
Thanks, New York.
