Other languages not subtitled

2
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,773
You need a bath, Borras.

3
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,999
- [ Manita, manita. ]
- [ Yes? ]

4
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,587
- [ It's almost 1pm. ]
- [ I'm coming. ]

5
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,237
- Manita, my keys...
- [ There they are. ]

6
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,626
- [ I'm leaving. ]
- [ Take care. ]

7
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,425
Borras, stay.

8
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:40,501
- Don't let him out.
- Hi, Borras.

9
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,217
[ Manita, manita!
Fermín is on the phone. ]

10
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:51,262
What are you saying?

11
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:58,603
- [ Go away. ]
- [ Ok, but I want to know. ]

12
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,899
- What are you saying?
- Go upstairs.

13
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:06,319
Stop talking like that.

14
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,197
Go.

15
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,215
- [ What did Fermín say? ]
- [ Just hello. ]

16
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,468
[ Yeah right. ]
You're dating!

17
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:35,431
[ Of course not. ]
He's just a friend.

18
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:42,855
- Besides, you introduced us.
- I'm just messing with you.

19
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,691
They're home.

20
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,778
Borras.

21
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:55,952
Borras, stay.
Come in.

22
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:15,137
So that kid was throwing water balloons
at cars that were driving by.

23
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:21,143
Then an army jeep drove by,
the kid throws a balloon at it,

24
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,854
the solider gets mad,
he gets out, and shoots him.

25
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,189
Oh God! Is he ok?

26
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,858
He shot him in the head.
He's dead.

27
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,402
How awful.

28
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,071
Adela?

29
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:38,327
Mrs. Sofia is here
and the kids want strawberries.

30
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,538
Hurry.

31
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,375
Thank you.

32
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,003
- I got an A plus.
- That's great!

33
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,755
And Sofi did, too, I imagine.

34
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,926
Cleo, my husband's two suits
need to be taken to the cleaners.

35
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:56,679
But do it today, please.
He needs to pack, he's leaving Friday.

36
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,514
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you.

37
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,976
- Dad's going away?
- To a conference in Quebec.

38
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,146
- Where is that?
- In Canada!

39
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:10,359
- You're so stupid!
- I didn't know, so what?

40
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,903
Not for Sofi, she'll get fat.

41
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:21,787
...when I tell you that I'm poor,
you won't ever, smile again...

42
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:29,962
...I long to have it all,
and lay it at your feet...

43
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:39,263
...But I was born poor,
and you'll never love me.

44
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,603
- You shouldn't be up here.
- I'm taking care of him.

45
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:51,484
Your mom won't like it.
Don't go near the edge.

46
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:15,132
- You were supposed to die.
- Why me?

47
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:18,219
- 'Cause it's my game.
- Then I don't want to play anymore.

48
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,138
Well, I don't want you to play it,
you little sissy.

49
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:54,714
And what's up with you?
Aren't you gonna tell me?

50
00:11:54,922 --> 00:12:00,219
- Can't talk. I'm dead.
- Then resurrect.

51
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:04,932
- I can't. I'm dead.
- Alright then.

52
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,862
What are you doing?

53
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:24,535
What are you doing?
Tell me.

54
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:28,372
I can't. I'm dead.

55
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:40,468
Hey. I like being dead.

56
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,396
Here, Borras.

57
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,913
Dad's home early!

58
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,327
- Who's here?
- Daddy.

59
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:40,731
- Hello.
- Who are these kids?

60
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:45,235
- I'm glad you're home early.
- What a surprise!

61
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,618
-Money for the hurdy gurdy?
-I don't see any.

62
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,495
No, money to get one.

63
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,164
- So tell me Your Excellence.
- Your Excellence.

64
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,041
Thank you, sir.

65
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,419
-Have you heard the latest news?
-What about?

66
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,129
Hawaii, Doctor.

67
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,383
I'm very well, thank you.

68
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:47,673
-Cleo, can you get the Doctor a tea?
- No! She's with me!

69
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:52,344
- She'll be right back.
-Just a few more minutes.

70
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:19,913
[ Scoot. ]

71
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,458
[ Hey! ]

72
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:27,546
Make Dr. Antonio a chamomile.
[ Move. ]

73
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,934
Angel of God, my guardian dear...

74
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,396
...to whom God's love commits me here.
Ever this day, be at my side...

75
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:48,108
...to light and guard,
and rule and guide.

76
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:57,868
[ Little one, sleepy little one. ]

77
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:03,791
[ Sleep with the angels. ]

78
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,763
Time to sleep, my darling.

79
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,433
- Good night, Cleo.
- Good night, Sofi.

80
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,352
I love you.

81
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:27,564
I love you too.
Sweet dreams.

82
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,858
You too.

83
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,739
Toño, go to sleep!

84
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:39,952
...and if your mom asks
when you'll be back?

85
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:44,206
I'll call her.
Where's my brown tie?

86
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:48,418
- I'll ask Cleo.
- This house is a mess.

87
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:55,134
The fridge is full of empty cartons
and there's dog crap everywhere.

88
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:45,244
- [ Why so long, manita? ]
- [ Pepe turned on the lights again. ]

89
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,829
[ He's a prankster. ]

90
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,124
- Yes. My boy.
- Little devil.

91
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,379
Yes. But I love him.
Turn off the light.

92
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:59,091
[ Mrs. Teresa doesn't
like it on. ]

93
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:05,264
[ Oh that Mrs. Teresa.
She is probably spying on us. ]

94
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:11,103
Yeah, she's there stalking you.

95
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:15,774
- Hurry up.
- She probably stays awake.

96
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,903
Taking care of us.

97
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,657
Taking care we don't
waste electricity.

98
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,660
- Ready?
- Yes.

99
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,621
One.

100
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,791
Two.

101
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,128
Three.

102
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,425
[ Mrs. Adela. ]

103
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,928
One.

104
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:49,433
- For the tamales.
- They were yummy.

105
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,395
Two.
For the tortas.

106
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,009
- [ I won. ]
- [ We drew. ]

107
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,137
- [ No, I won. ]
- [ But the car! ]

108
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,015
[ Let's eat. ]

109
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,440
No movement yet.

110
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:44,529
Professor Zovek is used
to challenges.

111
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:50,577
[ Do you remember 'pushy' Moises,
from home? ]

112
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:55,707
- [ He kept sending me letters. ]
- [ What did they say? ]

113
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:58,460
[ That he can't stop
thinking about me. ]

114
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,421
[ That he needs to see me. ]

115
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:06,843
[ Then my cousin arrives carrying
a bunch of letters. ]

116
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:11,098
[ And I recognized Moises'
handwriting on one. ]

117
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:15,102
[ So I grabbed it and opened it. ]

118
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:21,775
[ "I can't stop thinking about you.
I want to see you." ]

119
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,278
- [ Sweet thing. ]
- [ Yeah right, 'sweet'. ]

120
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:29,658
- [ That letter was for another girl! ]
- No!

121
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:35,080
The bastard sends exactly the
same letter to all the girls.

122
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:41,670
Why so lonely with your tacos?

123
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,548
Hello, Ramón!
Hello, Fermín!

124
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:47,175
- You guys want a bite?
- Thanks, we ate.

125
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,763
If you're done, let's go.
I like watching the previews.

126
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,473
Let's go.

127
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:27,466
- You really feel like seeing a movie?
- I like movies. Don't you?

128
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:30,886
But it's so nice outside.

129
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,389
Yes, it's nice.
Want to go to the park?

130
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,642
Sure.
Give me a sec.

131
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,982
What, you not coming?

132
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:47,694
- It's really nice outside.
- Look at you.

133
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:52,073
I'd rather play in the dark.
Tell me everything later.

134
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,079
Shall we?

135
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:06,439
- What?
- You train every day?

136
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:12,028
I must.
I owe my life to martial arts.

137
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,199
I grew up with nothing.

138
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:26,918
My mother died when I was a kid.
I moved with my aunt to the slums.

139
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:32,340
There my cousins beat me.
And I met the wrong crowd.

140
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:37,554
And I started drinking, and then huffing.
I was dying.

141
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:44,060
But then I discovered martial arts.

142
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,271
And everything came into...

143
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,899
...focus.

144
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:58,450
Just like when you look at me.

145
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:38,758
[ Kitty, kitty,
sleepy kitty cat. ]

146
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:43,596
[ Wake up as here
comes the mouse. ]

147
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:58,820
- Good morning, my princess.
- Morning, Cleo.

148
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,322
Time to wake up.

149
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,743
I need to pee.

150
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,916
- Good morning, Sofi.
- Good morning, Grandma.

151
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,846
Paco.
Wake up, my angel.

152
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,599
Come on.

153
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,771
It's time.

154
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,529
- I want one!
- They're mine.

155
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:26,366
- I got them for everyone.
- But I put them in the freezer.

156
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:31,037
Give Sofi one and I'll
get you a box.

157
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,462
Hurry up kids, it's 7:20.

158
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:43,174
Nah-huh, it's 7:17.

159
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,135
Here. Get fatter.

160
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,263
- Turn that off!
- No!

161
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,473
- Turn it off!
- Ok, I'll turn it off.

162
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:53,101
- Cleo, hold the dog.
- Yes, ma'am.

163
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,436
- Get out my way!
- You get out of my way!

164
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,980
Shotgun!

165
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:06,656
- Put on Radio Exitos!
- I'm up front. I choose.

166
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:12,328
- Be careful.
- Move over.

167
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:16,457
- Change the station!
- No, it's Creedence vs. Beatles.

168
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:20,336
- Move!
- Calm down, for God's sake!

169
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:24,257
You choose when
it's your turn.

170
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:28,052
- Settle down.
- Shut up.

171
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:31,890
- I'm not going to shut up.
- You too, quiet!

172
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:00,543
When I was old, you were there,
but you were someone else.

173
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:04,213
- When you were old?
- Yes.

174
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:09,344
- Or when you get old?
- No, when I was old.

175
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:15,350
- And when was that?
- Before I was born.

176
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:20,521
- And what did you do then?
- I was a pilot.

177
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:24,233
- A pilot?
- Yes, a fighter pilot.

178
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:28,112
- Did you like it?
- No, it was scary.

179
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:32,909
Was it?
I'll be right back.

180
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,750
- [ Good evening. ]
- [ Why didn't you wake me? ]

181
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:47,048
God forbid you'll get tired.
Prepare Dr. Antonio's oatmeal.

182
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:53,054
- Mom!
- Good morning!

183
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,355
Your juice.

184
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,984
Pepe will wait to say
goodbye to Daddy.

185
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,611
- It's fine if he's late.
- Yes, ma'am.

186
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,864
- I'll take the bags, Doctor.
- Thanks.

187
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,034
- Hi, Daddy!
- Your oatmeal is ready, Doctor.

188
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,704
Pepe waited to say goodbye.

189
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,288
Morning, Pepón!

190
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,624
Yuck! Cigarette!

191
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:49,902
- Damn...
- Mom, Daddy stepped on dog poo.

192
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:54,073
- Let me help you, Cleo.
- Thank you, Doctor.

193
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,583
- Bye, Pepón!
- Bye, Daddy.

194
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,377
- Take care.
- You too.

195
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:09,839
- Go with Cleo.
- Yes, Mom.

196
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:28,232
- We'll be here, Antonio.
- It's just a few weeks.

197
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:37,260
Goddamnit! I've told you
to clean up the dog shit!

198
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,555
I'll take him. Come on.

199
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,850
- Bye, Cleo!
- Bye.

200
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:07,433
Hey, I have to...

201
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:26,327
It's just that, I'm late.

202
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:44,053
I think I'm pregnant.

203
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:52,228
Ah, well.
That's good, right?

204
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,147
Yes?

205
00:37:57,316 --> 00:38:00,861
Yeah.

206
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:26,971
- I need the bathroom.
- But it's almost over.

207
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,432
Yes, but I have to go now.
I won't be long.

208
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:31,767
- Want an ice cream?
- No.

209
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:44,233
No strings!
No tricks!

210
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:55,327
Boom!
Bones is dead!

211
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:10,885
It's raining, it's pouring!
The old man is snoring...

212
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:52,468
[ Manita. You take it. ]

213
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,388
[ Don't be afraid. ]

214
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:10,653
- And when they ask about their dad?
- Say he's on a business trip.

215
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:15,908
Thank you, Cleo.

216
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:21,830
Mrs. Sofi? When you have
a minute can we talk?

217
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:27,211
Sure,
but just call the kids first.

218
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:29,046
Ok.

219
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:35,594
- Stay calm.
- Paco, Toño, your mom is calling you!

220
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:41,684
- You have to be strong for the children.
- Okay, Mom.

221
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:47,940
Sofi, Pepe, your mother
is calling you.

222
00:42:54,572 --> 00:43:00,869
Come, sweetie.
We'll come back after.

223
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:20,097
- I got more hail than Sofi!
- I got more than Pepe!

224
00:43:20,222 --> 00:43:24,518
- No, I got more.
- You both have the same.

225
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:28,814
- I'm going to the stationers.
- You can go later. Sit down, Cleo.

226
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,524
I have news.

227
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,235
- We're going to Disneyland!
- Yeah, Disneyland!

228
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:36,822
No. We're spending Christmas
at your uncle's.

229
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:41,952
- It's so boring there!
- No it isn't, my cousins are there!

230
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,039
And New Year's,
we'll go to the Bárcenas' Hacienda.

231
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,207
Are the Richards going?

232
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:51,420
- And the Larssons.
- When's Dad coming?

233
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:57,176
His research is keeping
him in Quebec a little longer.

234
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,845
- Until January?
- He doesn't know.

235
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:04,683
But I brought paper so you
can write him a letter.

236
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:09,271
Tell him that you love him and
to please come home soon...

237
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,856
I'm going to the store.

238
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,692
You're not going anywhere
until you're done with your letter.

239
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:17,321
- Where are you going?
- Can't I write it in my room?

240
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,572
No!

241
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:24,536
- Sure. Go to your room.
- Then I'm going up too.

242
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,504
Sofi, I need to talk with Cleo.

243
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:36,465
Help Pepe write his letter at the table.

244
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:40,469
Help him write,
"I miss you a lot, Dad".

245
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:44,848
- Make lots of pretty drawings.
- Let's go, Pepe.

246
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,021
Wait, Sofi!

247
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,818
Come, Cleo.

248
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,032
What's up?

249
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:07,705
What is it?
Are you alright?

250
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:12,876
- Yes.
- Sure? What's wrong?

251
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:17,798
- Is your mom alright?
- Yes.

252
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:22,636
- Oh, Mrs. Sofi...
- What's wrong?

253
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:27,933
It's just that I think
I'm pregnant.

254
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:33,939
- What do you mean you "think"?
- I haven't gotten my period.

255
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:40,946
- Since when?
- I don't know...

256
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:46,910
- Who's the father?
- Fermín. The cousin of Adela's boyfriend.

257
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:52,791
- Does he know?
- He's gone.

258
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,836
Silly.

259
00:45:55,961 --> 00:46:02,217
- Are you going to fire me?
- Fire you? Of course not!

260
00:46:02,301 --> 00:46:07,598
We have to take
you to get checked.

261
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:12,519
- Look, Mom! I drew a plane.
- Let's see.

262
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:16,148
Why is Cleo crying?

263
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:19,943
She has a tummy ache.

264
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:26,241
Pain, pain, go away.
I don't want this pay to stay.

265
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:29,745
Sofi! I told you to help Pepe
write "I miss you a lot, Dad".

266
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,497
He wouldn't let me help!

267
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,916
Sorry.

268
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:15,058
We have an appointment
with Doctor Vélez.

269
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:19,771
- Under what name?
- Cleodegaria Gutiérrez.

270
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,315
Here she comes.

271
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,235
- Sofía!
- Margarita! How are you?

272
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,696
Thank you for seeing us.
Remember Cleo?

273
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:30,824
- Hi, Cleo, how are you?
- Fine, thank you, Doctor.

274
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:34,995
I'm going to check her
and we'll see you later.

275
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:38,165
Ok. I'll go to say
hi to Dr. Zavala.

276
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,460
It'll take about 40 minutes.

277
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:44,546
Cleo, come with me.

278
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:51,720
When was your last period?
About when?

279
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,598
Three months.

280
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:59,811
Are you sexually active?

281
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,607
You are.

282
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,654
When did you start?

283
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:13,700
Has it been long?

284
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:19,831
- Not long.
- One or two years?

285
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:27,798
- Less.
- But more than three months?

286
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:32,552
How many sexual partners
have you had?

287
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:38,684
Just one?

288
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,353
Don't worry. This is common.

289
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:46,400
We'll examine you from the waist down...

290
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:51,154
...she'll get you in position.

291
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:54,408
Lie down, carefully.

292
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,792
Put one leg here.

293
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,878
And the other here.

294
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:15,887
I'll see you in a month.
Any questions?

295
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:21,226
There she is.
I'll go with you.

296
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:25,397
He hasn't even
called the kids.

297
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,775
- Mario!
- Doctor.

298
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:34,448
- How's Cleo?
- Cleo is fine.

299
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:38,076
She's three to four months
pregnant.

300
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:41,663
With some rest she'll be fine.

301
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:47,044
- When's she due?
- Around the end of June.

302
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:50,172
- Thanks for seeing her.
- It's nothing!

303
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,883
- Take care.
- You too.

304
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,634
- Mario.
- Doctor.

305
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,678
- Take care.
- Thanks.

306
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:59,890
Cleo, why don't you go to see the
newborns...

307
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:03,852
...while I finish up with Dr. Zavala?

308
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,188
You have to talk to Antonio.

309
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:14,905
- Look at your little sister, Azucena.
- I'm glad she's a girl.

310
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:20,619
Yes. So you can play with her.

311
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:26,583
I'll do her hair, and bathe her...

312
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:34,132
Soon we'll take her home so
you can play with her.

313
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:39,596
Earthquake!
Kneel.

314
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,641
Get the babies out!

315
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:45,685
- Don't run!
- Use the stairs!

316
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:48,563
"Our Father, Who art in Heaven..."

317
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,443
Hurry, the babies!

318
00:52:57,883 --> 00:52:59,885
Are they gonna be talking in English
the whole time?

319
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:03,263
Yes. And Ricky isn't even Gringo,
he was born in Mexico.

320
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:06,641
- Yes, but his mom is Gringa.
- Leslie scares me.

321
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,727
She makes me feel like I stink.

322
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,395
Because you do stink, fatty.

323
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:13,064
You smell even more, idiot.

324
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,525
Stinky.

325
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,236
Shut up, idiot.

326
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:37,172
- Comadre, welcome!
- Hi, "commy".

327
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:42,427
- That belly of yours?
- I'll tell you later.

328
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:48,391
- Yes, you will.
- Sure, but give me a hand.

329
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:52,437
You sure you
can carry it all?

330
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:56,316
I'm pregnant, not sick.
Why, you tired?

331
00:53:56,441 --> 00:54:00,654
- As if!
- You've got so old since last year.

332
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:03,949
Mountains are old,
but they're still green.

333
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:08,453
Here! You're pregnant
and forgetful?

334
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:13,333
- That's one bed.
- This goes here.

335
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:16,878
And there's the other.

336
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,923
This one's for Paco.

337
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,345
They were in storage.

338
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,682
They're all the dogs
that lived here.

339
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:32,269
Look. That there
was Pirata...

340
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:36,022
...he died in 1911.

341
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:40,610
- Do you remember Canela?
- Yes, where is she?

342
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:44,364
Look at her.
She died last summer.

343
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:47,409
They say she ate a poisoned rat.

344
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:53,498
But I'm sure it was the villagers
angry with Don José over the land.

345
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:57,043
Come on.

346
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,984
What do you think
of these city folks, Celso?

347
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:07,447
- Should we send for more bullets?
- There's plenty, Doctor José.

348
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:11,701
Paco! Don't go there!
Cleo, get him.

349
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:15,205
Paco, I'm telling you.
Stay there!

350
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,832
What? Women don't shoot?

351
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,169
No, no, no. Not that.
Leslie is our representative.

352
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:25,882
- Doesn't count, she's a Gringa.
- Ok, I'll go.

353
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:45,026
You look great, Lola.

354
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:57,789
Watch out Pepe! Your wife is
going to join the guerrilla!

355
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:03,753
- She's going to expropriate your hacienda!
- Nah, I'll whack her first.

356
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:48,483
- Come with me.
- Where?

357
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,402
- Just come.
- What about him?

358
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:54,656
Is the boogeyman coming?

359
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:02,247
Where are we going?

360
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:06,251
Don't ask.
The city's made you distrustful.

361
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,461
No, Benita.

362
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:12,757
- Look at the dogs.
- They're tired.

363
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:16,427
The kids won't leave
them alone.

364
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:25,436
Be careful, don't roll down
with that belly of yours.

365
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:28,398
No, Benita.

366
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:44,330
- There's a lot of music.
- It's New Years!

367
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:46,541
Should I call Lupe and Yola?

368
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:50,086
No, no, no.
We don't want those city nannies here.

369
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,880
They feel fancier than their bosses.
Come on.

370
00:59:57,635 --> 01:00:01,180
- They allowed you out?
- Move aside.

371
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,516
Sit here.

372
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:08,021
- What are you drinking?
- Nothing, thank you.

373
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:11,899
You're not going to toast the
New Year with us?

374
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:16,195
- It's not good for the baby.
- A little won't hurt.

375
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:21,034
Celebrate while you can!
See that man over there?

376
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:25,913
They killed his son in
August over the land dispute.

377
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:29,667
- You're carrying life, right?
- Yes.

378
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:34,213
- So then? Mezcal?
- No, just a little pulque.

379
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:37,008
That's the spirit!

380
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,305
Here.

381
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:48,770
To a beautiful 1971 and
your baby's health!

382
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:54,567
- Sorry, Manita...
- Go dance, Gloria!

383
01:00:54,692 --> 01:01:00,073
Don't worry.
I'll pour you some more.

384
01:01:00,531 --> 01:01:04,077
Here.
Clean yourself up.

385
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,746
Salud!

386
01:01:34,273 --> 01:01:37,860
- What's wrong with you?
- I know you need it.

387
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:42,782
- Billy, no!
- I just wanted to comfort you.

388
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:49,205
- You're drunk.
- You're not even that hot, comadre.

389
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,488
Fire!

390
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:06,115
Fire!... Fire!...

391
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,785
The forest is burning!

392
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:14,540
Everybody! Quick!
Fire in the woods!...

393
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:20,087
Come on! Move!
This way, everyone!

394
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:32,433
Careful!
Cover that side!

395
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:40,274
- Come here. Now!
- We need water!

396
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:44,237
Make a chain!

397
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:51,035
We need water!
Pass the buckets!

398
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,955
Kids! Stay back!

399
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:59,377
Kids! Don't step on the flames!

400
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:07,969
Cleo, help the little ones
get water.

401
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:12,723
Just the little fires.

402
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:18,604
That's it, Andy!
Gerardo, Cleo will help you.

403
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:28,447
Not too close to the fire!

404
01:06:25,606 --> 01:06:29,860
I got one!
It ran away!

405
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:37,159
Got it!

406
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:56,429
- We'll reach the hill skirt and come back!
- Skirt?

407
01:06:56,595 --> 01:06:59,890
- The hillside.
- The hill has a skirt?

408
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:04,270
- The slope then!
- Alex! The hill has a skirt!

409
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:08,649
If we look under we
can see its panties.

410
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:11,861
- What are you doing?
- Peeking at the hill's panties.

411
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,655
Hills don't have panties.

412
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:17,950
- Neither do you!
- Asshole!

413
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:21,162
I'm going to tell your parents!

414
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,597
This feels like my village.

415
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:43,893
It's drier there.
But it feels like it...

416
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:49,899
The animals do that too.

417
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:56,906
It sounds like this.

418
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:04,371
And smells the same.

419
01:08:30,147 --> 01:08:35,569
They repaired the Galaxy.
It looks like new!

420
01:08:40,658 --> 01:08:43,160
The Cowboys won because
Baltimore got cocky.

421
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:47,665
- We won anyway!
- Baltimore got cocky...

422
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:51,836
- Who likes the Cowboys?
- And Cruz Azul champions forever!

423
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:53,754
- Hello, Beto.
- Afternoon, Señora.

424
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:56,048
- Can we go to the movies?
- To see what?

425
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:58,259
- Marooned.
- I wanna see it too.

426
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:01,762
- Only Beto and me.
- Why?

427
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:04,056
- I wanna go too!
- No!

428
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:06,517
- Everyone can go!
- Not fair!

429
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:09,812
- I'm going.
- You're not.

430
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:12,481
- Everyone goes!
- That's not fair!

431
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:15,025
If you don't like it,
go live elsewhere!

432
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,069
Mrs. Molly is on the phone.

433
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:19,238
- I'll get it upstairs.
- I'll take them.

434
01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:21,740
No! You won't like it.

435
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:24,326
- I like movies.
- Not this one.

436
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:26,495
Eat poo!

437
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:31,458
- Is it a cartoon?
- No, it's not.

438
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:35,713
- You don't know what Marooned is.
- Yes, I do!

439
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:57,234
We're late!
Are you coming?

440
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:01,572
- Grandma, we need to go.
- Toño, let's go. We're leaving!

441
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:05,576
Wait! I'm coming.

442
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:25,763
- Catch him!
- Hurry up!

443
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:29,433
Come on, we're late!

444
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:38,025
What are you waiting for?

445
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:44,531
Don't run!

446
01:11:01,382 --> 01:11:03,467
- Toño!
- Run!

447
01:11:03,592 --> 01:11:06,470
- Cleo, get them!
- I'll see you at the movies!

448
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,973
Control your children!

449
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:34,975
- Check her out!
- Look at her!

450
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:38,228
Antonio.

451
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:41,398
Hey, watch out!

452
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:44,276
- Look, your dad!
- Run, Antonio, run!

453
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:47,321
- No, it wasn't my dad.
- Yes, it was your dad.

454
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:49,948
I said no!

455
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:55,871
Put the magazine away!

456
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:03,087
Your grandma is worried.

457
01:13:06,799 --> 01:13:09,927
Come on, let's get the tickets.

458
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:23,375
...following our illustrious governor
instructions...

459
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:29,798
...to improve the infrastructure,
I've come here today...

460
01:14:29,923 --> 01:14:40,851
...to respond to your
demand for water.

461
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:49,026
This can only happen by
uniting the will of the people...

462
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:57,409
...with the leadership of our illustrious
President Luis Echeverría Álvarez.

463
01:14:57,534 --> 01:15:01,205
Excuse me, do you know
where this address is?

464
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,916
- That way.
- Thank you.

465
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:08,712
We will move... above and beyond!

466
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:19,658
Ramón!

467
01:16:23,245 --> 01:16:25,205
Ramón!

468
01:16:26,873 --> 01:16:29,668
Hold up.
Wait.

469
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:32,087
- What's up, Cleo?
- Hi.

470
01:16:32,212 --> 01:16:34,965
I just came to give
Fermín his jacket.

471
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:38,885
- I'll give it to him.
- But, I need to talk to him.

472
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:42,431
- He's not here.
- It's important.

473
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:45,475
But we're rehearsing.

474
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:49,354
Adela said you
would help.

475
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:52,441
One sec.

476
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:56,194
Hold on to this.

477
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:59,197
Can you give me a ride?

478
01:16:59,323 --> 01:17:00,407
Let's go.

479
01:17:00,532 --> 01:17:03,493
Hold on, let me
put on some pants.

480
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:24,723
Here is where he trains.

481
01:17:24,848 --> 01:17:27,059
Thank you, Ramón.

482
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:33,774
- Don't tell him I brought you.
- No. Thank you.

483
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:06,408
Right flank!

484
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,470
- It's Zovek.
- No! Really?

485
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,930
Yes! Look at him.

486
01:19:29,055 --> 01:19:32,309
- The Professor Zovek?
- Yes!

487
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,103
Does he always come here?

488
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:38,315
No. But sometimes
he trains them.

489
01:19:52,579 --> 01:20:00,378
Welcome!
May the energy dwell in you.

490
01:20:02,422 --> 01:20:03,715
You.

491
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:05,050
You...

492
01:20:05,175 --> 01:20:07,093
...and you as well!

493
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:09,262
You can become a warrior!

494
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:12,349
Every human has a great potential...

495
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:15,435
...that can be developed
through physical training.

496
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:23,068
Yes! But most importantly through
the evolution of the mind...

497
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:25,612
...and the spirit.

498
01:20:25,862 --> 01:20:30,617
You can develop this potential.
But don't expect a miracle!

499
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:37,123
The only miracle resides
within your own will.

500
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:46,216
Remember, the mind
is the motor for the physical.

501
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:50,762
And next up next...

502
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:56,184
an act.

503
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:05,527
This act requires total
physical and mental focus.

504
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:15,495
Only the Lamas, martial arts masters
and a few great athletes...

505
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:19,374
...have been able to master it.

506
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:23,712
You.

507
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:26,339
Yes, you. Come here.

508
01:21:29,342 --> 01:21:32,554
Please cover my eyes.

509
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:38,393
Make sure they are properly covered.

510
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,816
Thank you. You may return to
your place.

511
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:27,901
What? Disappointed?

512
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:32,739
What did you expect?
For me to levitate or lift a jet?

513
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:35,533
You are witnessing an
incredible feat!

514
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:39,829
If you don't believe me?
Then try it.

515
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:43,249
But with your eyes closed.

516
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:44,644
Hey, Lobo!

517
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:46,688
Hey, Fermín.

518
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:50,525
What about the new trainers?

519
01:23:50,650 --> 01:23:56,364
- The Korean coach is good.
- Yes, but tough.

520
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:05,457
Fermín.

521
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:09,502
Do you have a minute?

522
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:14,049
Piss off!

523
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:19,220
- Hi, Cleo.
- Hi, Fermín.

524
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:21,723
What brings you around?

525
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:26,936
I've left you messages,
but I couldn't find you.

526
01:24:27,437 --> 01:24:30,607
I'm sorry, training has been intense.

527
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:33,777
They even brought a gringo coach
and a Korean.

528
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:37,155
Well, the American was already here,
but the Korean is new.

529
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:41,576
- Is it for the Olympics?
- Something like that.

530
01:24:41,701 --> 01:24:44,704
Who told you I was here?

531
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:52,003
A neighbor's brother-in-law
trains here with you.

532
01:24:52,128 --> 01:24:54,964
- It was Ramón.
- No.

533
01:24:55,090 --> 01:25:01,930
I'm gonna kick that
fat fucker's ass.

534
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:08,186
- It's just that I'm pregnant.
- What's it to me?

535
01:25:08,311 --> 01:25:12,023
- It's that... The little one's yours.
- No fucking way.

536
01:25:12,148 --> 01:25:16,027
- I swear it is.
- I told you, no fucking way.

537
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:19,989
And if you don't want me to beat
the shit out of you and your "little one"...

538
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:24,077
...don't ever say it again,
and don't ever come looking for me again.

539
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:30,542
Fucking servant!

540
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:36,339
Hurry up, Fermín!

541
01:25:58,027 --> 01:26:02,991
He went with his mistress
to Acapulco.

542
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:08,163
He hasn't sent a dime,
and it's been six months.

543
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:12,458
He says he's short on money
and doesn't have any to send.

544
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:17,130
But now he likes diving,
and is buying all the gear.

545
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:21,968
You know how much that costs?

546
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:28,683
He sent the kids a letter
pretending he's in Quebec.

547
01:26:28,808 --> 01:26:35,899
Just bullshit he invents:
That the landscape is beautiful...

548
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:42,238
That he misses them
but his research is delayed.

549
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:45,658
Lies!

550
01:26:47,493 --> 01:26:51,539
- Ok, don't worry, I'll call you later.
- Paco, come here.

551
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:56,044
Are you spying on me?

552
01:26:56,169 --> 01:26:59,631
I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry!

553
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:06,012
And you! Why did
you let him? Why?

554
01:27:07,597 --> 01:27:12,101
Why are you still there?
Don't you have anything to do?

555
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:14,896
Get out!

556
01:27:15,021 --> 01:27:19,400
Please, don't tell your siblings.

557
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:29,035
You're winning by two laps!

558
01:27:30,620 --> 01:27:33,248
He's passing you, Paco!

559
01:27:33,373 --> 01:27:36,417
But I'm still winning.

560
01:27:37,001 --> 01:27:41,714
- I want to play!
- No. Move!

561
01:27:43,132 --> 01:27:45,426
- Move, Pepe.
- No.

562
01:27:45,551 --> 01:27:48,012
- Move!
- No.

563
01:27:48,137 --> 01:27:50,598
I said move!

564
01:27:51,266 --> 01:27:53,977
- That's mine, Paco!
- No, it's mine.

565
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:35,893
Cleo!

566
01:28:36,019 --> 01:28:39,355
- They're fighting.
- I'm coming.

567
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:48,906
Paco, Toño, stop!
You're going to get hurt!

568
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:51,576
You're not animals!

569
01:28:53,619 --> 01:28:55,621
Let him go!

570
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:59,334
Paco, drop that!

571
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:02,128
What are you doing!
Drop that!

572
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:07,008
Don't be an idiot!

573
01:29:07,133 --> 01:29:11,721
Are you stupid?
You could've killed him!

574
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:15,308
It's very dangerous.

575
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:23,900
[ Hey manita. ]

576
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:27,904
[ I heard the government
came to the village... ]

577
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:31,741
[ ...to seize land, and they've
taken your mom's. ]

578
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:36,954
- [ How can I help her? ]
- [ You could go see her. ]

579
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:42,919
- [ Like this? ]
- [ Don't worry. ]

580
01:29:48,174 --> 01:29:51,636
[ Go rest, I'll open the gate. ]

581
01:31:15,052 --> 01:31:17,346
We are alone.

582
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:23,644
No matter what they tell you,
we women are always alone.

583
01:32:10,316 --> 01:32:13,819
We'll have to park here.
The students are protesting.

584
01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:17,573
Oh, God. I hope they don't
beat them again.

585
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:19,492
Look. Someone's leaving.

586
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:39,345
Go ahead.

587
01:33:42,992 --> 01:33:45,202
Good afternoon, Señora.

588
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:50,082
My maid needs a crib.
Can you show them to us?

589
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:55,087
- She'll show them to you.
- Thank you.

590
01:33:55,212 --> 01:33:58,341
This way, please.

591
01:34:06,265 --> 01:34:08,184
How about this one?

592
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:12,438
- Do you like it, Cleo?
- It's very pretty.

593
01:34:12,563 --> 01:34:14,774
How much is it?

594
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:18,861
No, but with a
long-standing client discount.

595
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:21,781
Let me ask the manager.

596
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:25,451
We bought the furniture for
the boy's room here.

597
01:34:25,534 --> 01:34:27,703
Which is now in
Sofi and Pepe's room.

598
01:34:27,828 --> 01:34:29,664
- The blue set?
- Yes.

599
01:35:04,073 --> 01:35:06,283
Please help me!
They're killing us!

600
01:35:13,165 --> 01:35:15,418
Where is he?

601
01:35:17,586 --> 01:35:20,214
Get in!
Leave him alone!

602
01:35:20,339 --> 01:35:22,174
Move!

603
01:35:22,299 --> 01:35:24,969
- Shut up!
- Come here!

604
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:28,889
I said shut up!

605
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:33,018
Fermín!
Let's go!

606
01:35:38,649 --> 01:35:41,318
Let's go! Now!

607
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:44,947
Help me!

608
01:35:49,618 --> 01:35:52,788
Help!

609
01:35:54,582 --> 01:36:00,421
Be calm, Cleo.
Ignacio!

610
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:27,323
Help me!

611
01:36:28,824 --> 01:36:31,911
Jorge, please, let's go!

612
01:36:34,246 --> 01:36:36,916
Why?

613
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,126
Help!

614
01:36:39,251 --> 01:36:42,588
Help me!

615
01:37:14,745 --> 01:37:20,376
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee...

616
01:38:21,145 --> 01:38:23,731
Dr. Vélez!

617
01:38:24,106 --> 01:38:26,859
- Dr. Vélez!
- Get in line!

618
01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:29,778
- You have an appointment?
- Her water broke.

619
01:38:29,904 --> 01:38:34,742
- Find Dr. Vélez.
- Here she comes.

620
01:38:34,867 --> 01:38:37,661
Doctor, your patient is here.

621
01:38:37,786 --> 01:38:41,081
Orderly, please.
Sofía just called me.

622
01:38:41,206 --> 01:38:45,169
Hello, ma'am.
Cleo, you're having contractions.

623
01:38:45,294 --> 01:38:50,007
Let's get her to delivery.
You'll have to fill out some forms.

624
01:38:50,132 --> 01:38:52,968
Paty, take their information.
We're going to delivery.

625
01:38:53,093 --> 01:38:56,722
Yes, doctor.
Please, come this way.

626
01:38:56,847 --> 01:39:01,060
- What's her full name?
- Cleodegaria Gutiérrez.

627
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:04,355
- Her middle name?
- I don't know.

628
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:07,441
- How old is she?
- I don't know.

629
01:39:07,566 --> 01:39:10,486
Her date of birth?

630
01:39:10,611 --> 01:39:14,114
- What's your relationship with the patient?
- I'm her employer.

631
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:17,284
Is there any family
member here?

632
01:39:17,409 --> 01:39:20,079
- No. No.
- That's fine.

633
01:39:20,245 --> 01:39:23,332
One last question.
Is your patient insured?

634
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:33,133
Good evening.

635
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:38,138
Careful.
Let's go.

636
01:39:41,308 --> 01:39:43,435
One moment, please.

637
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:45,104
Excuse me.

638
01:39:45,229 --> 01:39:46,855
Doctor.

639
01:39:46,981 --> 01:39:51,193
Hello, Cleo. How are you feeling?
Don't worry. Everything will be fine.

640
01:39:51,318 --> 01:39:54,196
Isn't it, Dr. Vélez?
How many babies have you delivered?

641
01:39:54,321 --> 01:39:57,241
Hundreds, doctor.

642
01:39:57,366 --> 01:40:02,788
Give me your hand.
And breathe.

643
01:40:02,913 --> 01:40:06,542
- We must hurry.
- Yes, doctor.

644
01:40:10,879 --> 01:40:13,757
Excuse me.
Over here.

645
01:40:14,717 --> 01:40:16,385
This way.

646
01:40:16,510 --> 01:40:20,180
Dr. Vélez won't let me go in.
You'll do great, Cleo.

647
01:40:20,305 --> 01:40:23,267
Feel free to come if you like.

648
01:40:23,392 --> 01:40:27,438
- I can't. I have an appointment.
- Come on, let's go.

649
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:33,569
I'm taking a patient to delivery.
Ask admissions for her file.

650
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:38,157
Please assist me.

651
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:41,994
Pass me the partogram.
Let's examine her.

652
01:40:42,411 --> 01:40:44,288
Yes, doctor.

653
01:40:44,413 --> 01:40:48,417
She's in labor.
Her water broke.

654
01:40:48,542 --> 01:40:51,837
Cleo, when was your last period?

655
01:40:51,962 --> 01:40:54,006
September.

656
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:57,843
I'm removing your underwear
and shoes.

657
01:40:57,968 --> 01:41:00,262
We're moving you into position.

658
01:41:00,387 --> 01:41:05,392
- I'm going to listen to your baby.
- When did your water break?

659
01:41:05,517 --> 01:41:10,522
- Around two hours ago?
- We couldn't get here quicker.

660
01:41:10,647 --> 01:41:15,027
- Don't worry. Breathe.
- I'm uncovering your belly.

661
01:41:15,194 --> 01:41:18,781
Easy, Cleo.
Breathe deep.

662
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:23,410
- How is the heart rate?
- I can't hear anything, doctor.

663
01:41:23,535 --> 01:41:26,288
- A glove, please.
- Glove, doctor.

664
01:41:26,413 --> 01:41:29,958
I need you to breathe deeply.

665
01:41:30,084 --> 01:41:34,213
I'm going to inspect you.
It'll bother a bit.

666
01:41:34,338 --> 01:41:37,674
- Relax. Easy, please.
- It's going to hurt a little.

667
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:41,762
- How is it?
- Complete. Direct. Third plane.

668
01:41:41,887 --> 01:41:46,225
- Meconium liquid, doctor.
- We need to canalize.

669
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:50,354
- Moving patient to surgery.
- Let me listen to your baby.

670
01:41:50,479 --> 01:41:52,856
Easy.

671
01:41:52,981 --> 01:41:55,692
- I'm not hearing anything, doctor.
- Let's move.

672
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:58,487
Get the stretcher.

673
01:41:58,612 --> 01:42:01,865
Cleo, breathe deeply.
We're taking you to surgery.

674
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:04,660
Ok. One, two, three.

675
01:42:04,785 --> 01:42:07,538
- Let's go!
- Easy.

676
01:42:07,913 --> 01:42:13,669
Patient coming through.
Call pediatrics!

677
01:42:45,951 --> 01:42:49,913
- Call pediatrics.
- No scrubs. It's an emergency.

678
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:52,374
Turning on lamp.

679
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:59,506
Everyone ready?
One, two, three.

680
01:43:00,382 --> 01:43:03,552
Pediatrics to surgery!

681
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:08,849
Move your waist
further down, please.

682
01:43:10,976 --> 01:43:15,314
Doctor, she's crowning.
No time for your scrubs.

683
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:19,526
- Pediatrician to the room!
- He's in the room, doctor.

684
01:43:19,651 --> 01:43:24,489
- Doctor, she's crowning.
- I'm checking.

685
01:43:24,615 --> 01:43:28,535
Where is the pediatrician?

686
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:31,038
I'm here, doctor.

687
01:43:31,163 --> 01:43:36,919
Patient ready to deliver.
The head is out.

688
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:42,007
Edwin, please.
Cut the cord.

689
01:43:42,132 --> 01:43:45,844
- Tongs.
- Cut the cord, please.

690
01:43:45,969 --> 01:43:48,263
Cutting.

691
01:43:48,847 --> 01:43:53,769
- We couldn't hear a heart rate, doctor.
- Bulb.

692
01:43:53,894 --> 01:43:55,729
Your stethoscope.

693
01:43:55,854 --> 01:43:58,941
We're going to give you
a few stitches.

694
01:43:59,066 --> 01:44:02,653
- I can't hear a heartbeat.
- Listening.

695
01:44:02,778 --> 01:44:06,698
It's in arrest. Begin resuscitation.

696
01:44:06,823 --> 01:44:09,159
Your placenta is coming out.

697
01:44:09,284 --> 01:44:12,537
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

698
01:44:12,788 --> 01:44:14,122
Listening.

699
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:17,459
Your placenta is coming out.

700
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:21,672
Ma'am, I can't hear
a heartbeat.

701
01:44:21,797 --> 01:44:23,507
Placenta coming out.

702
01:44:23,632 --> 01:44:28,136
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

703
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:33,058
Listening.
No response.

704
01:44:33,183 --> 01:44:36,061
- Another cycle, doctor?
- Let's continue.

705
01:44:36,186 --> 01:44:40,607
- One, two, three.
- Ventilating.

706
01:44:40,732 --> 01:44:44,278
- Here it is, doctor.
- Listening.

707
01:44:44,444 --> 01:44:50,033
No response.
We're suspending CPR.

708
01:44:57,082 --> 01:45:02,629
- Doctor, what's the patient's name?
- Cleo, doctor.

709
01:45:02,754 --> 01:45:05,424
Cutting...

710
01:45:06,133 --> 01:45:12,389
Cleo, I'm very sorry.
Your baby was born dead.

711
01:45:12,514 --> 01:45:16,977
We did all we could, but
there was no response.

712
01:45:17,102 --> 01:45:19,146
Would you like to hold it?

713
01:45:23,942 --> 01:45:29,364
Here is your baby.
It's a girl.

714
01:45:34,828 --> 01:45:39,166
Say goodbye to her.

715
01:45:40,584 --> 01:45:46,465
I need to take her now, Cleo.
Say goodbye to her.

716
01:45:51,345 --> 01:45:56,558
Let me have her, please.
I need to prepare her.

717
01:46:02,397 --> 01:46:05,901
Allow me...

718
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:09,613
- Prepare her, please.
- Yes, doctor.

719
01:46:09,738 --> 01:46:11,740
...Gutiérrez, Cleodegaria.

720
01:46:11,865 --> 01:46:15,077
Here's the file, doctor.

721
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:28,799
There's a bit of bleeding.
We gave you a few stitches.

722
01:46:28,965 --> 01:46:33,345
We're very sorry, Cleo.

723
01:48:21,077 --> 01:48:26,833
Cleo! The knife sharpener!
[ Shake yourself off. ]

724
01:50:02,053 --> 01:50:06,224
- Toño! Sofi! Come!
- Mom bought a new car!

725
01:50:06,349 --> 01:50:09,728
- You like it?
- How fast does it go?

726
01:50:09,853 --> 01:50:11,521
Why not a Maverick?

727
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:14,858
Too expensive.
I wanted a smaller car.

728
01:50:14,983 --> 01:50:18,820
- I've had it with that Galaxy.
- I like it, Mommy.

729
01:50:18,945 --> 01:50:23,074
- What about the Galaxy?
- I sold it.

730
01:50:23,199 --> 01:50:25,285
- It goes next week.
- Does Dad know?

731
01:50:25,452 --> 01:50:28,371
No, it's a surprise.

732
01:50:28,496 --> 01:50:31,583
- Do you like the new car, Cleo?
- Yes.

733
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:33,126
And speaking of surprises.

734
01:50:33,251 --> 01:50:36,630
We're taking the Galaxy
for a goodbye trip.

735
01:50:36,755 --> 01:50:38,256
- Where to?
- Tuxpan.

736
01:50:38,381 --> 01:50:39,424
Where's that?

737
01:50:39,549 --> 01:50:41,301
- I've got a match.
- Skip it.

738
01:50:41,426 --> 01:50:42,844
Tuxpan is near Veracruz.

739
01:50:42,969 --> 01:50:44,387
- Is there a beach?
- Yes.

740
01:50:44,512 --> 01:50:46,514
The beaches in Veracruz are ugly.

741
01:50:46,640 --> 01:50:49,017
And we're going to invite
Cleo along, right?

742
01:50:49,184 --> 01:50:50,477
Yes!

743
01:50:50,602 --> 01:50:52,395
Will you come?

744
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:54,356
Come on. It'll do you good.

745
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:56,066
-Right, Adela?
-Yes, ma'am.

746
01:50:56,191 --> 01:50:59,194
Besides, the kids will miss you
if you don't come.

747
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:02,614
But she'll be on vacation,
you can't make her work.

748
01:51:02,739 --> 01:51:07,494
- Will you come?
- [ Go Manita. I'll take care of the house. ]

749
01:51:07,619 --> 01:51:10,997
So, you're coming?

750
01:51:11,122 --> 01:51:13,291
Perfect!
Would you help me pack?

751
01:51:13,416 --> 01:51:15,377
- Yes, ma'am.
- Let's go pack.

752
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:18,088
[ Go. It'll lift your spirits. ]

753
01:51:18,213 --> 01:51:23,176
- I'm gonna help her pack.
- Pepe, bring the guns.

754
01:51:53,289 --> 01:51:56,418
Stop changing it.

755
01:51:58,211 --> 01:52:02,507
- La Pantera doesn't reach this far.
- I just heard it.

756
01:52:02,632 --> 01:52:04,551
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

757
01:52:04,676 --> 01:52:07,262
No, it's not! It's only in the city.

758
01:52:08,847 --> 01:52:10,223
Look! The sea!

759
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:11,850
Mom, stop, stop!

760
01:52:11,975 --> 01:52:16,688
- Let's go to the hotel first.
- No. It'll be dark by then.

761
01:52:16,813 --> 01:52:19,399
Beach! Beach!

762
01:52:25,029 --> 01:52:27,323
Alright.
But just for a little bit!

763
01:52:27,490 --> 01:52:28,783
Yeah!

764
01:52:43,256 --> 01:52:46,259
Let's go.

765
01:53:04,360 --> 01:53:07,906
- Come.
- No, I don't know how to swim.

766
01:53:08,031 --> 01:53:09,824
Come on.

767
01:53:09,908 --> 01:53:13,661
You go.
I'll watch you from here.

768
01:53:31,513 --> 01:53:36,226
- Which way?
- Follow me.

769
01:53:36,351 --> 01:53:39,521
- Can we go back again?
- Yes, of course.

770
01:53:39,646 --> 01:53:43,274
- But now a hot bath.
- Yes.

771
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:47,445
I want to go back.

772
01:53:47,570 --> 01:53:49,280
It was amazing!

773
01:53:49,405 --> 01:53:52,158
I jumped over a huge wave!

774
01:54:04,045 --> 01:54:08,049
Ow! Mom. Ow! Don't!

775
01:54:14,305 --> 01:54:19,394
- Ow! It burns!
- I'm almost done.

776
01:54:20,436 --> 01:54:24,023
Did you like the waves?

777
01:54:24,148 --> 01:54:27,318
I did.

778
01:54:27,443 --> 01:54:32,240
Do you know how to dive
under them?

779
01:54:33,491 --> 01:54:36,369
Have you gone mute?

780
01:54:36,494 --> 01:54:38,621
No. Let's go.

781
01:54:38,955 --> 01:54:42,208
- I told you to put on a t-shirt!
- But it was cloudy!

782
01:54:42,333 --> 01:54:45,461
The glare burns the most.

783
01:54:47,755 --> 01:54:50,091
Dressed already?

784
01:54:50,216 --> 01:54:53,177
Yes, but Cleo's gone mute.

785
01:54:53,303 --> 01:54:55,597
- Thank you, Cleo.
- You're welcome, ma'am.

786
01:54:55,722 --> 01:54:59,183
You two smell like salad.

787
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:25,418
Children...!

788
01:55:26,669 --> 01:55:29,005
Kids! Listen!

789
01:55:29,505 --> 01:55:31,382
I have something to tell you.

790
01:55:34,135 --> 01:55:36,554
Your dad isn't in Ottawa.

791
01:55:36,679 --> 01:55:42,060
- Is he back?
- No. Your dad never went away.

792
01:55:42,518 --> 01:55:46,648
Well he did, but only for a week.

793
01:55:46,773 --> 01:55:51,319
Your dad isn't coming back home.

794
01:55:52,362 --> 01:55:55,657
We came here so he
can take his things.

795
01:55:55,782 --> 01:56:01,454
- What things?
- What he says are his things.

796
01:56:01,579 --> 01:56:05,208
His clothes... his books...
the bookcases...

797
01:56:05,959 --> 01:56:08,962
Are you getting a divorce?

798
01:56:10,338 --> 01:56:14,092
- He doesn't know.
- He doesn't love us anymore?

799
01:56:14,217 --> 01:56:17,804
Of course he loves you,
a lot.

800
01:56:18,638 --> 01:56:21,975
- He says he wants to see you.
- When?

801
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:27,522
He doesn't know.
But soon.

802
01:56:27,897 --> 01:56:31,943
There's going to be changes.
But we'll be together!

803
01:56:32,068 --> 01:56:34,445
And it's going to be an adventure!

804
01:56:34,570 --> 01:56:37,573
I'm starting a full-time job
at a publishing house.

805
01:56:37,699 --> 01:56:40,535
But you're a biochemist.

806
01:56:40,660 --> 01:56:43,871
I know, but your dad
hasn't sent us any money.

807
01:56:43,997 --> 01:56:46,499
And teaching isn't enough.

808
01:56:46,624 --> 01:56:51,045
And I love books!
And I never really liked biochemistry.

809
01:56:51,170 --> 01:56:54,090
It'll be another adventure.

810
01:56:54,215 --> 01:56:57,802
And we must stay together,
really close.

811
01:56:57,927 --> 01:57:00,430
- Right, Cleo?
- Yes.

812
01:57:00,555 --> 01:57:04,100
Very, very close...

813
01:57:04,225 --> 01:57:07,228
Darling?

814
01:57:10,565 --> 01:57:12,483
Are you finished?

815
01:57:12,608 --> 01:57:15,028
For dessert, we have ice cream...

816
01:57:15,153 --> 01:57:17,447
...coconut, strawberry...

817
01:57:17,572 --> 01:57:19,323
...vanilla, banana...

818
01:57:19,449 --> 01:57:22,201
...and flan.

819
01:57:33,421 --> 01:57:36,090
Ready for the picture.

820
01:58:39,862 --> 01:58:43,950
- Are you coming in?
- No, I have to go check the tires.

821
01:58:44,075 --> 01:58:46,786
We're leaving early tomorrow.
Want to come?

822
01:58:46,911 --> 01:58:49,497
- No, it's our last day.
- I want to stay too.

823
01:58:49,622 --> 01:58:53,126
Ok, but no swimming.
Cleo can't swim.

824
01:58:53,251 --> 01:58:56,879
- But it's really calm.
- If you want to stay, that's the rule.

825
01:58:57,004 --> 01:58:59,966
- Near the shore?
- Ok. But only near the shore.

826
01:59:00,091 --> 01:59:02,135
- Yes!
- Can I swim too, Mom?

827
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:04,846
- Yes, but only near the shore.
- Yeah!

828
01:59:04,971 --> 01:59:08,349
Can you watch over them?
I won't be long.

829
01:59:10,434 --> 01:59:13,354
Stay close to the shore!

830
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:28,119
Paco! You heard your mom.
Otherwise, you're getting out.

831
01:59:32,957 --> 01:59:37,253
Sofi! Paco! Closer to the shore!

832
01:59:51,893 --> 01:59:57,064
When I was older,
I used to be a sailor.

833
01:59:57,190 --> 02:00:02,195
But I drowned in a storm.

834
02:00:02,737 --> 02:00:06,949
The waves were huge!

835
02:00:07,408 --> 02:00:12,997
- Sofi! Paco! Near the shore!
- It was dark...

836
02:00:13,122 --> 02:00:18,044
...and there was lightning,
and I didn't know how to swim.

837
02:00:18,169 --> 02:00:22,006
Wait here.

838
02:00:22,590 --> 02:00:26,177
Paco! Come closer!

839
02:00:29,764 --> 02:00:31,974
Sofi!

840
02:00:34,310 --> 02:00:38,231
Paco, help your sister!

841
02:02:43,356 --> 02:02:48,152
What happened?
Are you ok, my love?

842
02:02:48,277 --> 02:02:52,907
- Cleo saved us.
- Thank you... Thank you.

843
02:02:53,366 --> 02:02:56,369
Are you ok?

844
02:02:57,328 --> 02:03:02,333
- I didn't want her.
- What?

845
02:03:02,458 --> 02:03:07,421
- I didn't want her.
- They're ok.

846
02:03:09,131 --> 02:03:15,054
I didn't want her to be born.

847
02:03:16,722 --> 02:03:22,728
- We love you so much, Cleo. Right?
- Poor little thing.

848
02:03:25,606 --> 02:03:30,861
We love you so, so much.

849
02:04:31,922 --> 02:04:38,679
- I love you, Cleo.
- I love you too, darling.

850
02:05:31,106 --> 02:05:36,654
Hey, Toño, Sofi, Paco, come help.
Don't play dumb.

851
02:05:38,906 --> 02:05:41,992
Hi, Borras.

852
02:05:45,829 --> 02:05:48,999
- Hi, Adela.
- Hi.

853
02:05:49,124 --> 02:05:52,878
- Hi, Adela.
- Hello, kids.

854
02:05:53,003 --> 02:05:55,589
- Hi, Adela.
- Welcome, ma'am.

855
02:05:55,714 --> 02:05:59,009
- Can I leave this with you?
- Yes, ma'am.

856
02:06:01,971 --> 02:06:05,057
It looks awful.

857
02:06:05,182 --> 02:06:08,727
Without the bookshelves,
it's awful.

858
02:06:08,852 --> 02:06:12,773
- I like it like this.
- It's awful.

859
02:06:12,898 --> 02:06:17,027
- What's awful, Mommy?
- He misses the bookshelves.

860
02:06:17,152 --> 02:06:20,072
- Which bookshelves?
- The ones that were there.

861
02:06:20,197 --> 02:06:25,786
- [ I'm going to make dinner. ]
- [ I have so much to tell you. ]

862
02:06:25,911 --> 02:06:31,333
- They've switched the rooms!
- Where's mine?

863
02:06:31,458 --> 02:06:34,712
- Why change them?
- It's better this way.

864
02:06:34,837 --> 02:06:37,881
- I liked the old way better.
- Go check yours.

865
02:06:38,007 --> 02:06:42,553
- How did it go?
- Sofi and Paco almost drowned.

866
02:06:42,678 --> 02:06:46,223
Hi, Cleo.
Mrs. Sofi's room is there.

867
02:06:46,348 --> 02:06:49,893
- It's bigger.
- More comfy.

868
02:06:50,019 --> 02:06:54,273
- Cleo, check out my room!
- In a bit, ok?

869
02:06:54,398 --> 02:06:58,068
I love it, Mom!

870
02:06:58,193 --> 02:07:05,159
And we'll have more adventures!
We'll travel a lot.

871
02:07:05,284 --> 02:07:08,537
We'll go to Disneyland!

872
02:07:08,662 --> 02:07:12,916
We can't afford Disney,
but we can go to Oaxaca.

873
02:07:13,042 --> 02:07:17,129
- Yes, and visit Cleo's village!
- Great idea!

874
02:07:17,254 --> 02:07:21,467
Sure, whenever you like.
Mrs. Molly is on the phone.

875
02:07:21,592 --> 02:07:25,346
- Tell me, you almost drowned?
- Yes, the current pulled us.

876
02:07:25,471 --> 02:07:29,350
- The waves were 15 meters tall.
- No, they were only two meters.

877
02:07:29,475 --> 02:07:33,729
- No, they were taller!
- And Cleo saved us, right, Cleo?

878
02:07:33,854 --> 02:07:36,398
- Cleo, can I have a smoothie?
- Yes.

879
02:07:36,523 --> 02:07:38,776
- Me too.
- Are there any Twinkies?

880
02:07:38,901 --> 02:07:41,987
- Let me check.
- Yes, I got a box.

881
02:07:55,542 --> 02:07:57,878
[ Wait, ]
where are you going?

882
02:07:58,003 --> 02:08:01,465
- [ To buy ham. ]
- [ But I have so much to tell you. ]

883
02:08:01,590 --> 02:08:04,551
- [ Did you have a good time? ]
- [ Yes, it was very nice. ]

884
02:08:04,635 --> 02:08:07,262
[ I want to hear everything,
I'll be right back. ]

885
02:08:07,388 --> 02:08:10,683
[ But just get the ham.
No flirting. ]

886
02:08:45,759 --> 02:08:49,722
For Libo.
