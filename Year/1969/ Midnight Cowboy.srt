00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,235
Get along, little doggie

2
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,359
<i>It's your misfortune
and none of my own</i>

3
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,711
Get along, little doggies

4
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:49,399
For you know New York
will be your new home

5
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,595
Get along, little doggies

6
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,150
<i>It's your misfortune
and none of my own</i>

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,710
<i>Where's that Joe Buck?</i>

8
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,553
Get along, little doggies

9
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,310
Look at this crap!

10
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,709
<i>Yeah, where's that Joe Buck?</i>

11
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,758
<i>Where's that Joe Buck?</i>

12
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,399
You're late!

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:18,314
You know what you can do
with them dishes.

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,757
<i>If you ain't man enough,
I'd be happy to oblige.</i>

15
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,273
I really would.

16
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,192
<i>How you doin', Ralph?</i>

17
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,072
<i>4.00 to midnight.
That's when you're here.</i>

18
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,516
Could you have a word with me?

19
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,752
Why are you in that getup?
Grab an apron.

20
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,556
He knows what he can do
with that.

21
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,108
- You come to work?
- Guess not.

22
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,476
<i>Come for my pay.
I'm heading up east.</i>

23
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,950
<i>- Heading up east?
- Thought I'd say goodbye.</i>

24
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,156
Just come to look around.

25
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,275
Cups!

26
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,468
Well...

27
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,679
Goodbye.

28
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,355
Goodbye.
What'll you do back east?

29
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,150
<i>There's a lot of rich women
begging and paying for it.</i>

30
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,309
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,596
The men are tutti-fruttis.

32
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,875
<i>It's a mess back there.</i>

33
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,632
<i>I'm gonna cash in.</i>

34
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,154
<i>I don't know nothing about it.</i>

35
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,472
Why stay around here?
I got places to go.

36
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,757
<i>Oh, that's nice.</i>

37
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,398
Oh, lower...

38
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,270
<i>That's real... nice, honey.</i>

39
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,832
<i>It's powerful, ain't it?</i>

40
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,156
Yeah, sure is powerful.

41
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,478
<i>It's shooting season.</i>

42
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,428
<i>Go to Lloyd's
for all of your gun supplies.</i>

43
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,718
Listen to these values:
Remington shotgun for $72.47...

44
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,591
You look real nice, lover boy.

45
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,158
Make your old grandma proud.

46
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,277
You're the handsomest cowboy
in the parade,

47
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,476
<i>the best-lookin' one.</i>

48
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,589
<i>Bye, honey.
Dinner's in the fridge.</i>

49
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,195
Grandma got herself a new beau!

50
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,037
Excuse me. Do you have
another piece of gum for her?

51
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,952
Yes, I do. Here.

52
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,277
Take one for yourself.

53
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,275
<i>No, thanks. It's just till the
Dramamine works. She's carsick.</i>

54
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,430
I get carsick on boats.

55
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,708
<i>But that's more the fish smell
than the bouncing.</i>

56
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,472
How far you headed?

57
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,029
- To Dallas.
- Up Dallas?

58
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,351
- Where you going?
- New York City, ma'am.

59
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,712
Do you love me, Joe?

60
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:12,190
Do you love me? You love me?

61
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,439
You're the only one, Joe.
You're the only one.

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,629
You're better
than any of 'em, Joe.

63
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:31,236
You love me? You're the best!
Love me, Joe.

64
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,791
Do you love me, Joe?
Do you love me? Love me.

65
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,429
You're the only one, Joe.

66
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,550
You're the best, Joe. The best.

67
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,433
This is the Sunshine Hour.

68
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,876
Yes, sweet Jesus, faith healeth!

69
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,316
<i>Here's a letter from a sister
enclosing $10...</i>

70
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,793
<i>and two tumours she coughed up
during last week's broadcast.</i>

71
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,758
Before we join
in prayer for her,

72
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,312
Jesus wants to know who sent in
$5.00 for the home worship kit.

73
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,075
- Want a cigarette, sir?
- No, thanks. Chew tobacco.

74
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,992
<i>...with Sister Rosellen.</i>

75
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,072
Throw in Rosellen,
you got a deal!

76
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,357
You ever met a cowhand named
Woodsy Niles? Woodsy Niles, sir?

77
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,477
<i>- Not to my knowledge.
- My grandma's friend.</i>

78
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,392
I want it on.

79
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:08,911
<i>For it's hi! Hi! Hee!
in the field artillery</i>

80
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,551

Hear that?

84
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,434
<i>What's your male ideal?</i>

85
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,797
<i>Gary Cooper, but he's dead.</i>

86
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,394
<i>Thanks. And what's your ideal?</i>

87
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,028

Excuse me, ma'am.

Thank you.

95
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,671
Shit.

96
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,473
She'll give us
her remedy for insomnia.

97
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:56,156
<i>It's pretty unusual,
but I move furniture around.</i>

98
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,950
<i>Everything but the sofa.
That's my remedy for insomnia.</i>

99
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,272

<i>I'm looking for
the Statue of Liberty.</i>

109
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,674
Ma'am!

110
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,518
Were you serious
about the Statue of Liberty?

111
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,913
<i>- Yes, ma'am. I mean business.
- I'm sorry. I...</i>

112
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,550
Well, the Statue of Liberty...

113
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,792
I think you take
the Seventh Avenue subway.

114
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,155
- No, wait...
- You're sure pretty.

115
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,914
You're not looking for
the Statue of Liberty at all!

116
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,992
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

117
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:40,189
<i>Come on, Baby, do it for Mama.
Come on, Mama's tired.</i>

118

<i>Hey, little ol' dog!
How you doin'?</i>

<i>I'm brand new here. I was hoping
to see the Statue of Liberty.</i>

122
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,197

- Statue of Liberty.

123
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,397
<i>It's in Central Park
taking a leak.</i>

124

I got your message.
How do you feel?

127
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,554
I loved your friend
Mr Needleman,

128
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,598
the last of the great
King Midases.

129
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,514
My God, I was exhausted.
It was beautiful, but...

130
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,991
God, stop!
I die from that! What?

131
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,713
No one. I was talking to Baby.
I was talking to the dog, Maury.

132
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,997
<i>You're annoying me.
Don't start up again.</i>

133
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,029
<i>Why don't you say hello to Baby?
Baby wants to say hello.</i>

134
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,636
<i>I won't talk to the dog!</i>

135
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,998
- Daddy wants to say hello.
- Hello, Baby.

136
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,472
Hello, you goddamn dog.
Bow-wow-wow, Baby.

137
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:15,633
Will I see you tonight?
Wherever you say.

138
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,268
<i>- Just you and me.
- That's great.</i>

139
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,794
- How about Lindy's?
- What time?

140
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,872
<i>Like 5.30.
We don't have to rush.</i>

141
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,952
<i>- My wife's away.
- Beautiful, baby.</i>

142
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,874
I can stay all night.
How about a kiss?

143
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,748
You got it. A big wet one.

144
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,473
Save some of that
for tonight. Love you.

145
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,313
- Love you.
- Love you, kid.

146

Welcome to Dateline.

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,630
In our isolation booths...

148
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,110
<i>- Because I'm a stable-hand?
- One, two...</i>

149
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,395
<i>- Is God dead?
- Let's not talk about it!</i>

150
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,160
Can I take my mother?

151
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,959
- My God!
- It makes black whiter.

152
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,951
- Knees up.
- Come on out!

153
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,429
Cass, you got yourself
a damn penthouse.

154
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,953
Real damn penthouse.

155
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,714
<i>Don't look.</i>

156
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:56,234
<i>Knock off a couple of pounds,
and I'd really be gorgeous.</i>

157
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,838
<i>Don't touch. I'm late already.
What time is it? Oh, my God.</i>

158
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,796
Straighten out the bed, Tex.

159
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,997
Say, Cass, sure have
enjoyed being here.

160
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,868
<i>It's as fine a time
as I've ever had.</i>

161
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,428
<i>- Me, too, lover.
- That's good.</i>

162
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,231
You made me feel so at home,
I hate to bring up business.

163
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,598
<i>It's murder. What line are
you in? Zip me up.</i>

164
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,838
<i>Maury's always complaining
about ulcers.</i>

165
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:38,109
<i>I don't know what line Maury's
in, but I'm a kind of hustler.</i>

166
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,956
Pardon me, ma'am?

167
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,951
Got to make a living.

168
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,273
<i>- Did you hear me?
- My mind isn't all here.</i>

169
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,990
<i>I don't want to be late.
Why don't you run along.</i>

170
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,629
Take the number.
We'll get in touch soon.

171
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:06,637
I forgot to get to the bank.
I need a few bucks for a taxi.

172
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,918
I hate to ask you,
but you're such a doll.

173
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,197
<i>That's funny,
you mentioning money.</i>

174
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:20,674
- I was gonna ask you for some.
- You were?

175
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:23,752
<i>That's why I come up here.</i>

176
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,392
You were gonna ask me for money.
Who do you think I am?

177
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,153
Some old slut on 42nd Street?

178
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,995
<i>In case you didn't notice,
you Texas longhorn bull,</i>

179
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,877
<i>I'm a gorgeous chick!</i>

180
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,520
- Take it easy.
- You're 28!

181
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,876
<i>You can't pull
this kind of crap!</i>

182
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,349
- You're crazy!
- Come on now.

183
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,955
I could kill you!
Get out of here!

184
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,031
Get out of here!

185
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,113
Cass, honey...

186
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,079
Come on.

187
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,035
You think I meant that?

188
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,796
Would I ask you for money
with a wad like that?

189
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,440
Stop your crying.
You're gorgeous.

190
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,548
<i>A guy gets horny just lookin'
at you. How much you want?</i>

191
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,712
Five? Ten?

192
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,593
Twenty?

193
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,756
There you go, girl.

194
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,799
Terrific shirt.

195
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,908
- You speaking to me?
- I was admiring your shirt.

196
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,959
I bet you paid
a pretty price for it.

197
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,793
<i>- I ain't cheap.
- Yeah. Birds.</i>

198
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,599
<i>- It's an all-right shirt.
- I like birds.</i>

199
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,150
<i>I don't like
to wear cheap stuff.</i>

200
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,993
- Sure.
- Hi, cowboy. Got a cigarette?

201
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,319
- Hey, sweetheart.
- More faggots in this town...

202
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,789
- Kiss it, Ratso.
- Up yours.

203
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,668
- Watch out for that.
- You really know the ropes.

204
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,320
Wish I bumped into you before.

205
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,273
- Joe Buck from Texas.
- Enrico Rizzo from the Bronx.

206
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,397
<i>- I'm gonna buy you a drink.
- Sure.</i>

207
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,029
Drinks all around.
One for my friend, too.

208
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,033
When I get satisfaction,
I give her satisfaction.

209
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,954
<i>See what I'm getting at?
She got a penthouse,</i>

210
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,316
a colour TV, more diamonds
than the archbishop.

211
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,676
- She bawls when I ask her.
- For what?

212
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,116
- For money.
- Money for what?

213
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,476
<i>I'm a hustler.
You didn't know that?</i>

214
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,553
How should I know? You gotta
tell people these things.

215
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,312
<i>I'm a hustler.</i>

216
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,676
All right, you're a hustler.

217
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,152
<i>You're pickin' up trade
on the street... that's nowhere.</i>

218
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,598
- You gotta get some management.
- You put your finger on it.

219
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,559
You need my friend O'Daniel.

220
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,838
He operates the biggest stable
in the whole metropolitan area.

221
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,878
<i>It's stupid,
a stud like you paying.</i>

222
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,748
<i>A dame starts crying,
I'd cut my heart out.</i>

223
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,798
<i>I'd call that
a very minor operation.</i>

224
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,193
You just sit comfy, and
I'll cut it out for you, Ratso.

225
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,033
<i>- It's Rizzo.
- That's what I said.</i>

226
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,554
<i>- You heard him.
- That's OK.</i>

227
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,952
<i>I'm used to these types
that like picking on cripples.</i>

228
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,715
<i>- The sewer's full of 'em.
- One question, cowboy.</i>

229
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,712
<i>You're sitting here,
and he's sitting there.</i>

230
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:18,318
<i>How'll he get into your pocket?
But I guess he's figured it out.</i>

231
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,029
- Good night, sweets.
- Faggot.

232
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,358
Most of these gals
are older, dignified.

233
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,431
Social register types.

234
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:34,354
<i>They can't pick out
the merchandise in Times Square.</i>

235
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,116
<i>They got to have a middleman.
That's where O'Daniel comes in.</i>

236
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,879
<i>Hey! I'm walkin' here!</i>

237
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,748
Up yours, you son of a bitch!

238
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,872
<i>Don't worry about that.
Good way to pick up insurance.</i>

239
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,715
<i>That's crazy, a stud like you
paying that dame.</i>

240
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,392
With proper management,

241
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,836
you could earn 50,
$100 a day, easy.

242
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,117
Hey, Brucie,
hang in there, baby.

243
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,474
<i>What's that?</i>

244
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,438
Placed him with O'Daniel
two weeks ago.

245
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,750
<i>Ain't much of a stud.</i>

246
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,553
All right.

247
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,668
How about you introduce me
to Mr O'Diddleburg right now?

248
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,595
<i>I'd be doing both of you
a favour, but for what?</i>

249
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,036
Why am I dragging
my bum leg around?

250
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,113
Tomorrow, someone like that
may be scratching your back.

251
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,918
Where will I be?

252
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,993
<i>Hold on. You think
I'm that kind of son'bitch?</i>

253
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:55,437
You name your cut,
and you got it, I swear.

254
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,432
- All right.
- What you want? Five? Ten?

255
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,876
You kidding me?
I'll ask somebody else.

256
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,951
<i>- There's ten.
- All right.</i>

257
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,873
Forget it. I'll take the ten.

258
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:12,557
But I'll have to have
another ten to cover expenses.

259
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,393
I'll buy you a coffee.

260
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,829
Get out of here, creeps.
Go to work.

261
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,837
<i>He needs you tonight.
I got his tongue hangin' out.</i>

262
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,276
<i>His name is Joe Buck.
He's a cowboy.</i>

263
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,717
<i>Came in from Texas.
He don't know the ropes yet,</i>

264
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,792
<i>but he's
very promising material.</i>

265
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,910
<i>Fabulous. Right away.
What's your room number again?</i>

266
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,433
Right. OK.

267
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,719
The guy...
Hold it a second, will you?

268
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,472
How do you look?

269
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,472
Fine. You look fine.

270
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,393
Could I have that other ten?

271
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,918
I'll make this right
when I get set up.

272
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,594
- Forget it.
- Where do you live?

273
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,037
<i>- Sherry Netherland's Hotel.
- Sherry Neverland's Hotel.</i>

274
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,875
<i>Get your ass in there.
He's waitin'. You on vacation?</i>

275
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,077
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

276
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,150
- You must be Joe Buck.
- Yes, sir.

277
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,958
<i>Let's take a look.</i>

278
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,235
Turn around.

279
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:57,794
Good strong back.
You'll need it.

280
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,235
So you want help, hey?

281
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,518
Sit down. Relax.

282
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,910
<i>- Cowboy?
- I ain't a for-real cowboy.</i>

283
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,834
<i>- I'm one hell of a stud.
- Take it easy.</i>

284
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,838
You're different
from most of the others.

285
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:29,754
Most of them
are troubled and confused.

286
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,559
You know exactly what you want.

287
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,437
You bet I do.

288
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:41,551
Yeah... but you got one thing
in common with those other boys.

289
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,517
I'll bet you're lonesome.

290
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,353
Well, not too. I mean, a little.

291
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,669
Lonesome.

292
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,672
<i>I'm lonesome, so I'm a drunk.</i>

293
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,709
<i>I'm lonesome, so I'm
a dope fiend, I'm a thief,</i>

294
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,679
<i>I'm a fornicator, a whoremonger!</i>

295
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,196
Poop, I say. Poop!
I've heard it all.

296
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,239
<i>- I'm sick of it.
- I can see that.</i>

297
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:22,238
Lonesomeness... you take it, and
you go right on with your work.

298
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,108
<i>- I'm rarin' to go, sir!
- I believe you are.</i>

299
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,192
- Cowboy, eh?
- Yes, sir.

300
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,636
<i>- Ready for hard work?
- I'm ready for anything!</i>

301
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,508
It'll be easier for you
than for most others.

302
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,512
- Like money from home.
- Money from home!

303
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,750
<i>There's your strength, son!</i>

304
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,469
You put things earthy
so anybody can understand.

305
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:51,351
<i>I warn you, I'm gonna use you.
I'm gonna run you ragged!</i>

306
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,788
You're wonderful, boy.
We'll have fun together.

307
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,917
<i>- It needn't be joyless.
- No, it don't.</i>

308
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,348
<i>Why don't you and me get right
down on our knees right now.</i>

309
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,274
<i>- How's that strike you?
- Where?</i>

310
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:16,674
Right here! Here!
Right now! Why not?

311
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:22,039
I've prayed in the streets,
the saloons, and the toilets.

312
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:26,398
<i>It don't matter where
if He gets that prayer!</i>

313
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,119
<i>- Shit!
- That's the ticket!</i>

314
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,320
Open your heart and let it flow!

315
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,439
<i>- Don't be frightened!
- I baptise thee...</i>

316
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,160
And you shall be heard!

317
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,436
<i>...and the Holy Spirit.</i>

318
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,391
<i>Don't run from Him!</i>

319
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,990
You know that runty bastard
I was with?

320
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,638
<i>Don't know nothing.</i>

321
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,592
Stop it! Stop it!

322
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,076
<i>What's that monstrosity?</i>

323
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,754
- A toupee for dogs.
- For dogs?

324
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,834
<i>- This is Fifi's wig.
- That's for that dog?</i>

325
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,835
<i>I don't believe this!
There's something going on here.</i>

326
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:35,109
<i>Seriously, isn't this a case of
conning a lot of lonely people?</i>

327
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,319
We're lonely, yes.
Who else would do it?

328
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,074
A woman who is alone...

329
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:45,516
<i>Dinner's in the fridge,
lover boy.</i>

330
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,113
<i>Here's movie money.</i>

331
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,839
<i>That's sick,
dressing dogs like children.</i>

332
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,551
This is in case
she eats an onion.

333
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,678
<i>- That's terrible!
- She likes it.</i>

334
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,273
If I can find the hole...

335
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,519
Gold, silver, candlelight,

336
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,915
wine, and skyrockets
that glitter in your mind.

337
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,714
You're special.
Give yourself special treatment.

338
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,677
<i>Need money?
We'd love to lend it to you.</i>

339
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,073
Why worry about your future?
What do you want?

340
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,799
Take it easy, but take it.

341
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,155
Room 514, please.

342
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:23,628
Looks like you been locked out
till you pick up the tab.

343
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,915
What about all my things?

344
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,788
We keep them safe
till you get this settled.

345
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:36,319
You can keep everything but the
suitcase. It means a lot to me.

346
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,709
We keep everything. House rules.

347
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,712
Gonna eat them crackers?

348
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,838
<i>Spilled somethin' on my pants.</i>

349
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,792
- How do I get to Grand Central?
- Follow the green lights.

350
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:56,078
Officer, how do I get
to Grand Central?

351
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,316
You know what
you got to do, cowboy?

352
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,751
Spacecraft to Earth Control.
Check trajectory.

353
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,753
Captain Grace is
investigating the malfunction.

354
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,913
Orbital module has failed
to separate as planned.

355
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,076
Mission Control to spacecraft.
You have 30 seconds...

356
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,835
before you are ejected
into lunar trajectory.

357
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,592
Do you read me?

358
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,758
Spacecraft to Earth Control,
I read you.

359
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,229
Chuck, I've lost you!

360
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,757
We've lost contact with Captain
Grace. Can you track him?

361
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,911
Kiss me, Joe.

362
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,073
<i>He's in freefall.
Try to make contact.</i>

363
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,672
You're the only one, Joe.

364
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:56,472
<i>Kissin' Crazy Annie, man,
you'd better drink a drugstore.</i>

365
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,559
Kiss me, Joe.

366
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,158
You're the only one, Joe!

367
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,755
<i>I'm sorry you're sick.</i>

368
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,398
You'll have to give me
that money.

369
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:36,268
<i>I was lying. I don't have it.
What'll you do to me?</i>

370
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:40,319
<i>- You ain't got no $25 on you?
- No.</i>

371
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,393
- What'll you do to me?
- What do you think?

372
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:49,110
Want me to beat on you?
Is that what you want?

373
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,270
- How much you got?
- Nothing.

374
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,920
Empty your pockets out
over there.

375
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,558
<i>- Take my books.
- Don't want your books.</i>

376
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,757
<i>- What's that worth?
- Don't take my watch.</i>

377
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,719
<i>Please don't take it.
It's a cheap watch.</i>

378
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,952
<i>I can't go home without it.</i>

379
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:17,194
<i>My mother would die.
Don't take it. She'd die.</i>

380
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,191
She would die.

381
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,952
Please.

382
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,877
<i>I don't want it.</i>

383
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,270
Preparing for
this moment of glory,

384
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,752
<i>a basic training as rigorous
as the the star players'...</i>

385
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,876
long hours of choreography...

386
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,872
that would put
the Rockettes to shame.

387
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,953
Musical arrangements,
rehearsals, costume fittings.

388
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,989
America is being invaded.

389
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,516
You can spot the invaders
if they're alone.

390
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,115
They're dark, heavy,
and have noticeable accents.

391
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,670
Every day, they're working
themselves into more homes.

392
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,389
What can you do about them?
Enjoy them.

393
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:18,315
Better Homes and Gardens tells
you about new Spanish furniture.

394
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:21,437
<i>Don't hit me! I'm a cripple!</i>

395
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,876
<i>I ain't gonna hit you.
I'll strangle you!</i>

396
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,635
<i>- Wait a minute.
- Where's my money?</i>

397
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,358
- Here.
- Put it there.

398
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:33,512
All right, here.

399
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,398
<i>- That's all I got.
- That's all?</i>

400
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,512
<i>- What's in your socks?
- Nothing, I swear.</i>

401
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:46,152
<i>I swear on my mother's eyes.
Sixty-four cents. Take it.</i>

402
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,754
<i>It's sticky.
You slobber on it?</i>

403
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,992
Here. Have a cigarette.
Come on.

404
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,799
Come on.

405
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,394
Sit down.

406
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,918
<i>How do you like
O'Daniel flippin' out?</i>

407
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,555
I tried to find you,
but I've had this cold.

408
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:24,037
You want some medical advice?
Keep your mouth shut about that.

409
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:27,908
Right. Fine. OK.
Another subject.

410
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,116
You still at the hotel?

411
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,920
<i>Why am I talkin' to you?</i>

412
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:38,472
Hey, come on!

413
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,357
- Hey, wait up!
- Keep away from me!

414
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,079
<i>Don't come near me again.</i>

415
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,551
<i>I ain't fightin' you.
I got a place for you.</i>

416
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,757
<i>- I'm invitin' you!
- You're inviting shit.</i>

417
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:01,114
<i>The "X" on the windows
means no rent. It's condemned.</i>

418
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,870
Front door. Actually,
I prefer it that way.

419
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,520
Keeps the punks and creeps out.

420
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,078
My own private entrance.
You're the only one who knows.

421
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,635
Watch the plank!
Break your goddamn skull.

422
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,233
<i>Can't collect insurance.</i>

423
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,199
Back, back.

424
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,833
<i>There's glass there.</i>

425
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,317
Get that fridge, will you?

426
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,154
- Need any help?
- Not from you.

427
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,916
<i>You OK? It's not far.</i>

428
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,476
<i>It's just one more up.
The electric's off.</i>

429
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,791
<i>I don't mess with it.
Another convenience.</i>

430
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,475
But the icebox
will keep out the roaches.

431
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,519
<i>- Where'd you steal it?
- Been down there for weeks.</i>

432
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:13,718
<i>- I don't mean now. Before.
- Don't get a hernia.</i>

433
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,675
Just drop it anywhere.

434
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,678
Not bad, huh?

435
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,836
<i>There's no heat, but by winter,
I'll be in Florida.</i>

436
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,036
You want to stretch out?

437
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,673
Make yourself comfortable?

438
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:04,955
<i>OK... go ahead.
Why don't you take a nap?</i>

439
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,636
You like some coffee?

440
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:49,068
Joe, do you love me?

441
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,839
You're the only one, Joe.
You're the only one.

442
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,551
Joe, stop that!

443
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,318
<i>He's the one. The only one.</i>

444
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,676
<i>He's the one.
He's the only one.</i>

445
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:21,753
There have been
429 American casualties,

446
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:26,436
twenty-nine on the death list,
as opposed to 643...

447
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:30,718
Hey, why are you mad?

448
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,318
<i>- What's the matter?
- Where's my damn boots?</i>

449
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,319
Over there.

450
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,630
<i>- How'd they get off?
- I took 'em off.</i>

451
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:54,395
- What for?
- So you could sleep. Christ.

452
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:04,869
<i>- I should haul ass out of here.
- What's the matter now?</i>

453
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,191
You're after something.
What are you after?

454
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,230
<i>- Don't look like a fag.
- What's that mean?</i>

455
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,068
You want me to stay, right?

456
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,038
<i>I ain't forcing you.
Who's forcing you?</i>

457
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,635
<i>I'm truly sorry. Must've got
the wrong impression.</i>

458
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,830
OK. OK, boy.

459
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,392
I want you to stay.
I invited you, right?

460
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,871
<i>I hope you know what
you're in for. I'm dangerous.</i>

461
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,235
Someone does me bad...

462
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:54,394
<i>If I'd caught up to you
that night, you'd be dead.</i>

463
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:58,234
<i>- You hear?
- I'm impressed. You're a killer</i>

464
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,671
<i>I thought you should know,
that's all.</i>

465
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:21,470
Probably Y.M.C.A.
You make me want to puke, Ratso.

466
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,514
Joe, do me one favour.

467
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,353
- This is my place. Am I wrong?
- No.

468
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:39,989
<i>In my own place,
my name ain't Ratso.</i>

469
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:48,512
In my own place, my name
is Enrico Salvatore Rizzo.

470
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,318
<i>Can't say all that.</i>

471
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,635
Rico, then. At least
call me Rico in my own place.

472
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:59,836
OK. Rico, Rico, Rico.

473
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,310
<i>- Rico, Rico, Rico. That enough?
- That's fine.</i>

474
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,392
Give me one of those pillows.

475
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,717
<i>Don't touch my radio.</i>

476
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:46,312
Are you here again?
I told you to stay away!

477
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,632
- Every time, you take stuff!
- Stop picking on the cripple!

478
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,349
<i>- Cripple or not, I don't care!
- Goddamn it!</i>

479
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,394
The two basic items
necessary to sustain life...

480
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,199
are sunshine and coconut milk.

481
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:16,230
<i>You know that? That's a fact.</i>

482
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:19,676
<i>In Florida,
there's a lot of coconut trees.</i>

483
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,150
They even got 'em
in the gas stations.

484
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,191
And ladies! In Miami,
you got... You listening to me?

485
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:36,714
You got more ladies
than in any resort area.

486
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,078
<i>On a given day, there's
probably 300 on the beach.</i>

487
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,072
<i>You can't scratch yourself...</i>

488
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,232
<i>without gettin'
a bellybutton up the kazoo.</i>

489
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:49,470
<i>It's hot. Let's go.</i>

490
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,993
Come on!

491
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,392
Smells worse hot.

492
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:11,958
Then cook for yourself or get
a rich lady to cook for you.

493
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,508
<i>- I'm eatin' it.
- In her penthouse.</i>

494
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,558
<i>I'm eatin' it, Ratso. Good!</i>

495
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,396
<i>- It's good.
- Got to get out of here.</i>

496
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:31,040
Got to get out of here.

497
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,793
Anybody can score
in MiamiBeach, even you.

498
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:53,031
Nobody buys
that cowboy crap any more.

499
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:54,792
They're laughing at you.

500
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,750
<i>- Nobody's laughin'.
- I seen 'em laughin' at you.</i>

501
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:04,071
<i>When's the last time
you scored, boy?</i>

502
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,114
I only talk about that
in confession.

503
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,714
<i>When's the last time
you confessed?</i>

504
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,678
<i>That's between me
and my confessor.</i>

505
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:19,151
<i>You're beginning to smell.
For a stud, that's a handicap.</i>

506
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:25,713
<i>I ain't never seen you change
your underwear. That's weird.</i>

507
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:29,190
<i>I ain't got no need
to expose myself.</i>

508
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:35,469
<i>Bet you ain't never been laid,
and you tell me what women want!</i>

509
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,712
<i>I know that cowboy crap
don't appeal to nobody...</i>

510
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,030
except every 42nd Street Jackie.

511
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,270
<i>That's faggot stuff!</i>

512
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,557
<i>That's strictly for fags!</i>

513
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,110
<i>You gonna tell me
John Wayne's a fag?</i>

514
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,869
The way I look
makes me feel good.

515
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:18,788
<i>Women like me. Only thing
I ever been good for is lovin'.</i>

516
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:23,271
They're crazy for me.
They had to send Annie away.

517
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:26,875
<i>How come you ain't scored
this whole time?</i>

518
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,192
<i>'Cause I need management!
You stole $20 off of me!</i>

519
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,397
<i>Stop crappin' around
about Florida.</i>

520
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,836
Get your butt moving
and earn some management,

521
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,592
which you owe me!

522
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,238
<i>A woman in your condition
shouldn't have to do this.</i>

523
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,800
You have a lot of laundry!

524
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,755
<i>- It ain't right.
- What did it cost her?</i>

525
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,992
- What do you mean?
- The laundry lost some coins.

526
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,911
<i>- That's it.
- Take it.</i>

527
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,959
<i>That's good. Where's mine?
The black Homburg.</i>

528
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:43,273
<i>I don't know if your hat's here.
Bring me the ticket.</i>

529
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,989
What about that black Homburg?
Is that it?

530
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:54,116
<i>Ticket? Yeah, here's my ticket.
It's right there in the corner.</i>

531
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:59,274
- I'll look 'em over.
- Keep going. In the corner.

532
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:04,548
It not belong to you.
It belong to somebody else.

533
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,316
Bet you could
make a living at that.

534
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:41,394
And end up a hunchback
like my old man?

535
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:10,312
My dad spent 14 hours
a day in the subway.

536
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,188
<i>He'd come home
with two or three dollars.</i>

537
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:18,193
Coughed his lungs out
from breathing in that wax.

538
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,993
<i>Even the faggot undertaker
couldn't get his nails clean.</i>

539
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:27,196
Buried him with gloves on.

540
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,396
Go ahead. Take a look.

541
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,830
<i>Don't rush me.
Got to take your time.</i>

542
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,391
Get myself primed up for
some pretty little blond lady.

543
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,070
<i>When I'm feelin' good,
I spin around.</i>

544
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,914
There you are,
you handsome deviI!

545
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,072
Not bad. Not bad...

546
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,353
<i>...for a cowboy.</i>

547
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,633
You're OK.

548
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:07,753
You're OK.

549
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,393
Taxi!

550
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:33,038
You got something
on your shoulder. You got it.

551
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,599
Go ahead.

552
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,155
<i>You haven't got
a quarter, have you?</i>

553
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:49,156
- How do you like that?
- What you got?

554
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,152
I struck gold -
one high-class chick.

555
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,472
Barkley Hotel for Women. Women.

556
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:01,079
<i>Is this the gentlemen's
escort service?</i>

557
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:06,154
<i>I'm calling for Miss Beecham
at the Barkley Hotel.</i>

558
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:10,074
<i>She changed her mind.
She won't need nobody tonight.</i>

559
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,674
<i>That's right. Thanks. Bye.</i>

560
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:29,070
Would you believe a whole hotel
full of lonely ladies?

561
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,072
Score once,
and the way they talk,

562
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,118
I could open an office in there.

563
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:40,589
Go ahead. Get the money.

564
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:46,196
Listen, get the cash!
Remember the penthouse lady.

565
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,794
Those rich ladies
write a cheque,

566
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,838
and in the morning,
they stop payment.

567
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,754
Watch the car! Go on.

568
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:09,989
Rico! Up here! Up here!

569
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:36,354
B-6, G-49.

570
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,795
G-49.

571
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,118
L-24.

572
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,952
L-24.

573
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:48,956
And the next one is O-62,
ladies and gentlemen.

574
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:54,319
O-62. Are there any bingos?
The next one is B-13.

575
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,551
- How dare you!
- Wait a second, lady!

576
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,517
<i>Don't touch her!</i>

577
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,152
<i>It's 28 degrees,
and it's going down tonight.</i>

578
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,710
We can expect some
snow flurries later on.

579
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:20,120
I'll give you $5.00 for it.

580
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,039
Yeah.

581
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,639
I got a telephone
call from Jesus

582
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,393
I got him on the line

583
01:07:22,520 --> 01:07:24,954
Got a telephone call from Jesus

584
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:27,634
I got him on the line

585
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,720
I want to show you something.

586
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,595
<i>There's money for you.</i>

587
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:22,148
<i>That's $9.00 plus assorted
change, minus 26 cents for milk.</i>

588
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:25,232
Plus five cents
for Dentyne. Gum.

589
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:32,315
<i>That's smart. Light a cigarette.</i>

590
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:37,680
Buy a carton. Do it right.

591
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:43,235
<i>- Where'd you get it?
- I got it.</i>

592
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:49,715
<i>Where you been, 42nd Street?
That's where you been.</i>

593
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,109
<i>- Movies, that's where you been.
- Ain't been nowhere.</i>

594
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:00,876
<i>- That's where you got that.
- What, this?</i>

595
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,714
- "What, this?"
- A friend give it to me.

596
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,631
- A friend.
- Yeah.

597
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:11,555
<i>Who'd you ever do
a favour for? You stole it.</i>

598
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:17,268
<i>It's for you.
It's too big for me.</i>

599
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:21,717
<i>- I wouldn't wear it.
- I'll be goddamned if I will.</i>

600
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,153
Here.

601
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,837
Buy some medicine
before you die.

602
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:11,594
<i>- I hate boneyards.
- He ain't your father.</i>

603
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:49,395
<i>He was dumber than you.
He couldn't write his own name.</i>

604
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:54,315
<i>"X", that's what it ought
to say on that headstone.</i>

605
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:59,076
Just like our dump,
condemned by order of City Hall.

606
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:09,076
<i>My grandma, Sally Buck... she
died without lettin' me know.</i>

607
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:28,039
They're stormtroopers!
They made me get out of the car.

608
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,556
It all depends
on what you believe in.

609
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:36,839
Sometimes your spirit goes up,
sometimes it goes other places.

610
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,039
How long did I hold up traffic?

611
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:45,239
Give someone power, and they'll
supercede their authority.

612
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:48,835
This kind of thing is spiritual.

613
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:51,798
<i>Now you're talkin' priest talk.</i>

614
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,553
<i>I'm talkin' about
what people believe.</i>

615
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,838
Some people believe you can
come back in another body.

616
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:03,152
<i>- Not in yours, I hope.
- I ain't askin' you to.</i>

617
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:08,758
You could come back as
anything - a dog or a president.

618
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:14,198
<i>If I had my choice,
I'd come back as the president.</i>

619
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,271
What do you think?

620
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:21,150
Maybe you got to think
about those things for a while.

621
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:25,916
<i>I'm usually a very calm person.
Forgive me, I'm awfully sorry.</i>

622
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,958
I'll write a letter
to the mayor.

623
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,189
You're entitled
to think what you want.

624
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,794
- Maybe I do.
- Him.

625
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:40,315
Maybe I do believe it.

626
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:42,399
And I'll...

627
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,475
<i>...do some thinkin' about it.</i>

628
01:13:51,640 --> 01:13:54,837
- What was that all about?
- Lookee here.

629
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,150
I've been chosen for something.

630
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:04,079
- A come-on.
- A come-on to a party.

631
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:08,438
<i>Couple of whackos. Where do you
go, Klein's Bargain Basement?</i>

632
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,637
You go, you'll get
an encyclopaedia subscription.

633
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:16,555
Broadway and Harmony Lane.
Hansel and Gretel McAlbertson.

634
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:18,790
<i>- That's perfectly clear.
- Get out of here.</i>

635
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:22,589
What do whackos like that
want with us?

636
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:25,911
<i>It don't say nothin' about you.</i>

637
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:32,110
<i>- Nothin' about you, either.
- They took my picture.</i>

638
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,715
Want me to get lost?

639
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:41,909
<i>I didn't say nothin' about that.
Did I say that? Did I?</i>

640
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,312
<i>I'll tell 'em I don't go
nowhere without my buddy.</i>

641
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:53,040
<i>I ain't dressed for a party.</i>

642
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,036
There you go, right here.

643
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,359
Hey, dog.

644
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,633
You all right?

645
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:33,959
You OK?

646
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,631
You're sweating
all over the damn place.

647
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,719
Come here.

648
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:58,072
<i>- You got a comb?
- I don't need one.</i>

649
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:01,869
<i>Here. A few dozen cooties
won't kill me.</i>

650
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,351
- OK?
- Yeah.

651
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,351
- I look OK?
- Yeah.

652
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,596
OK, come on.

653
01:16:26,120 --> 01:16:27,792
Take my picture.

654
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,508
One more close-up of her.

655
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:49,993
I love the theatre.
I want to die on the stage.

656
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:55,791
<i>My hair, it's fur. It's tendrils
reaching out into space.</i>

657
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,269
I've watched it touch stars.

658
01:16:58,360 --> 01:17:00,112
They're all whackos.

659
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:02,919
<i>We better tell
somebody I'm here.</i>

660
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:12,268
- I made it. This is Ratso.
- Rico. Rico Rizzo.

661
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:16,035
<i>- Hello.
- There's beer behind me.</i>

662
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:17,713
Anything you want.

663
01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:20,838
Oh, Jesus.

664
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:29,312
<i>Hansel's a fag, and Gretel's
got the hots for herself.</i>

665
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:31,311
Load up on salami.

666
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,914
<i>- It's like what?
- It's like heroin.</i>

667
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,073
<i>Death is like heroin,
and it's nothing.</i>

668
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,230
<i>It's like death. It's nothing.</i>

669
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,834
- Why are you here?
- I dunno.

670
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:47,232
<i>- Who brought you?
- I don't know.</i>

671
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:05,993
Thank you, ma'am.

672
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,628
<i>What you doin'?
She give it to me.</i>

673
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,119
Do you want up or down?

674
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:29,878
Why are you stealing food?

675
01:20:29,960 --> 01:20:32,758
I noticed you're out of salami.

676
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:36,594
You should have someone go
to the delicatessen.

677
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:40,593
<i>You don't have
to steal it. It's free.</i>

678
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:44,912
<i>- Then I ain't stealing.
- How'd you get crippled?</i>

679
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:48,470
<i>- Slipped on a banana peel.
- What's the matter?</i>

680
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,597
- Get off me!
- Go use my shower.

681
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:56,037
<i>Go take a walk.
Don't touch me! Take a walk.</i>

682
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:58,395
Take a shave.

683
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:01,711
- Keep your hands off!
- You look hot!

684
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,997
- Guess who I am.
- Who?

685
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:09,232
<i>Me! How you doin'?
Gettin' your picture taken?</i>

686
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:29,358
Let's... leave now.

687
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:35,554
Your place... or mine?

688
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:43,274
<i>- She's hooked.
- Why, cowboy?</i>

689
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:47,148
- I'll expect 20 bucks.
- Why, cowboy whore?

690
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:52,792
<i>- Did you know we'd make it?
- You really mean business?</i>

691
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:57,954
<i>Who is he? Don't tell me
you two are a couple.</i>

692
01:23:06,920 --> 01:23:10,071
Are you really a cowboy?

693
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:14,915
<i>I ain't a for-real cowboy,
but I'm a stud.</i>

694
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,151
<i>A very expensive stud.
I'm his manager.</i>

695
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:25,190
- How much will this cost me?
- Twenty bucks.

696
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,638
- OK.
- And taxifare.

697
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:31,280
Get lost, will you?

698
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:34,432
That'll cost
one buck taxifare.

699
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:39,832
- OK?
- Yeah, OK, OK.

700
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,198
Oh, boy.

701
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,879
Here.

702
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,357
- Go ahead.
- Come on.

703
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:53,558
<i>- I don't even know your name.
- My name's Joe.</i>

704
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:57,792
Oh, fabulous!
Joe could be anyone.

705
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,668
I like that.
"Come here, Joe. Kiss me, Joe".

706
01:24:01,760 --> 01:24:04,593
<i>That's a good idea. Kiss me.</i>

707
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:17,872
Too much. He fell.
Hey, fella, you fell.

708
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:23,671
<i>- Is he all right?
- Yeah, he's fine.</i>

709
01:24:24,920 --> 01:24:28,799
<i>Why you hangin' on the banister?
Can't you walk?</i>

710
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:32,668
<i>- Naturally, I can walk.
- Yeah. He's got taxifare.</i>

711
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,753
- Come on.
- You sure you're all right?

712
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:23,397
<i>Well, it happens.
Don't worry about it.</i>

713
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:26,836
<i>It ain't never happened
to me before.</i>

714
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:31,152
<i>Bet your bottom dollar on that.
Where's the matches?</i>

715
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:33,913
Behind that thing.

716
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:49,868
<i>Maybe if you didn't call me
ma'am, it might work out better.</i>

717
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:52,918
<i>That's the first time
the thing ever quit.</i>

718
01:25:56,680 --> 01:26:01,117
<i>That's a fact.
You think I'm lying to you?</i>

719
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:06,228
<i>No, I don't think you're lying.
I just had this funny image.</i>

720
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:13,074
I had an image of a policeman
without his stick...

721
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:18,757
and a bugler without his horn,
etcetera, etcetera.

722
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,677
<i>I'm making it worse.</i>

723
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,596
We should take a nap...

724
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,355
<i>...and see what happens.</i>

725
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,998
<i>I ain't sleepy.</i>

726
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,190
I know... Scribbage.

727
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,033
Shit!

728
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:20,510
<i>- Look at this here.
- There's an "E" in "money".</i>

729
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:25,469
<i>- I mean, if that's your word.
- That's how you spell it.</i>

730
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:29,872
<i>It's on that big building.
M-O-N-Y. Money.</i>

731
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:36,756
"Y". What starts with "Y"?

732
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:42,152
It can end in "Y".

733
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:46,750
Like "say", "pay..."

734
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,592
"Lay".

735
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:53,956
Hey, hey... "lay".

736
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:01,509
<i>You're teasing me
so I can't think.</i>

737
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:11,712
"Gay" ends in "Y".
You like that?

738
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:19,872
- Cut that out.
- Gay. Is that your problem?

739
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:23,676
I'll show you a problem.

740
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,668
<i>I'm not. I'm not exaggerating.</i>

741
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:44,915
You should try it.
It might be terrific for you.

742
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:51,469
<i>For God's sake! What night
is PhiI's poker night?</i>

743
01:29:51,560 --> 01:29:53,039
Well, think!

744
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:56,356
Yeah, all right.

745
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:00,353
Joe, are you available
Thursday night? What time?

746
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:04,274
- Around 8.30?
- Let me think.

747
01:30:04,360 --> 01:30:10,356
Thursday, 8.30. I guess
I can be available. Hell, yes!

748
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,310
<i>It's all set
for Thursday at 8.30.</i>

749
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:20,472
<i>I can't talk now.
Call me at the office.</i>

750
01:30:20,640 --> 01:30:22,119
Yeah. Bye-bye.

751
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:27,157
Ma'am, I sure hate
to trouble you...

752
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:28,593
Sure.

753
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:32,399
<i>Twenty, wasn't it?</i>

754
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:33,879
Yes'm.

755
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:42,033
Bye.

756
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:07,479
Look right in there.
What do you see?

757
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:10,632
Try that on for size.

758
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:16,556
I got some aspirin,
Mentholatum, and all that crap.

759
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:24,357
<i>- Are they raw?
- No, but why'd you buy 'em?</i>

760
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:29,514
I could've lifted this.
Is that hot?

761
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:32,910
- You want some soup?
- Yeah.

762
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,630
<i>I'll get you some.
We ain't got to steal no more.</i>

763
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:42,999
I got eight bucks in my pockets
and 20 more come Thursday.

764
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:47,596
<i>- Give me some soup.
- What do you think I'm gettin'?</i>

765
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:50,319
<i>That's good healthy stuff.</i>

766
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:54,188
- Lookee there. Soup.
- Thank you.

767
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:55,952
<i>It's hot. Watch out.</i>

768
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:58,919
How was she?

769
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:02,994
- She went crazy.
- Yeah?

770
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:07,312
- She turned into an alley cat.
- Thanks for this stuff.

771
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,994
<i>- Don't mention it.
- It's good.</i>

772
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:17,791
<i>- Don't get sore.
- I ain't sore.</i>

773
01:32:19,440 --> 01:32:23,319
<i>I can't walk any more.
I've been falling down.</i>

774
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,748
<i>I'm scared.</i>

775
01:32:30,200 --> 01:32:32,236
What are you scared of?

776
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:38,190
<i>You know what they do when
they find out you can't walk.</i>

777
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:39,599
Oh, Christ.

778
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:46,598
I got to lay down.
I got to lay down.

779
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:50,070
Just take it easy.
I'll lay you down.

780
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:54,669
I'll lay you down.
There you go.

781
01:32:54,760 --> 01:32:58,150
Put this over you.
Now, you stay here.

782
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,998
<i>- Where you goin'?
- To get a doctor.</i>

783
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,798
- What?
- A doctor.

784
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,270
<i>- Don't get me no doctor!
- You're sick.</i>

785
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:13,353
<i>No doctors. No cops.
Don't be so stupid.</i>

786
01:33:13,440 --> 01:33:16,432
- What do you want?
- Florida.

787
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:20,229
<i>- I can't go.
- Put me on a bus.</i>

788
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:24,950
<i>- I don't need you.
- How will you get to Florida?</i>

789
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:30,398
<i>They'll only send me
to Bellevue. What're you doin'?</i>

790
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,916
- You're sick. Keep it on.
- Too hot now.

791
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,549
<i>Dumb. You're really dumb.
I don't need...</i>

792
01:33:37,640 --> 01:33:40,552
- Shut up!
- Dumb cowboy.

793
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:43,154
Damn it! Shut up!

794
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:47,199
You got to pull
a damn stunt like this.

795
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:51,952
<i>Shirley, how you doin'?</i>

796
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,193
With who?

797
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:59,235
When will she be home?

798
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:03,913
<i>It's a good friend of hers.</i>

799
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:10,316
<i>It can't wait that long.</i>

800
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:31,038
Too bad. We all have off days.

801
01:34:33,720 --> 01:34:38,271
<i>I'm Townsend P Lott
from Chicago. Call me Towny.</i>

802
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:42,273
<i>I'm here to have a little fun.</i>

803
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:47,598
<i>It's my first night.
Will you have dinner with me?</i>

804
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:51,912
<i>There's a French restaurant
not too far from here.</i>

805
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:56,193
<i>Don't worry about
how you're dressed.</i>

806
01:34:56,280 --> 01:35:01,229
I'll tell them
you're with a rodeo.

807
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:04,153
Besides, you look very elegant.

808
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:08,472
<i>I'm expecting a telephone call
back at the hotel.</i>

809
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:13,717
Mama? A coincidence.
Guess who was being discussed.

810
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:18,476
<i>Is that thing turned up?
Why aren't you wearing it?</i>

811
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:21,233
Really, Mama,
this is impossible.

812
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:23,436
Why go to the expense?

813
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:29,351
Did I tell you
I got me a sick kid?

814
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:33,752
I got to get him south,
quick as I can.

815
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:39,470
<i>I got a sick boy,
and I'm gonna get him south.</i>

816
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:41,278
You understand me, Towny?

817
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:47,118
What you got me up here for?

818
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:51,948
<i>Joe, it's... it's so difficult.</i>

819
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,390
I should never
have asked you up here.

820
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:01,192
You're lovely, really.

821
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:06,312
Oh, God, I loathe life.

822
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:10,916
- Please go.
- You want me to leave?

823
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:14,079
No.

824
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:21,395
I mean yes. Please go.
Come back tomorrow. Promise?

825
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:24,836
<i>- I'm going to Florida tomorrow.
- That's terrible.</i>

826
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:29,038
You meet someone, you think...

827
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:33,193
I want to give you
something for your trip.

828
01:36:36,280 --> 01:36:37,759
Please take it.

829
01:36:40,200 --> 01:36:44,273
<i>Take it. You don't have
to be Catholic.</i>

830
01:36:44,360 --> 01:36:47,796
<i>St Christopher's the patron
saint of all travellers.</i>

831
01:36:47,880 --> 01:36:50,838
Take it...
for helping me be good.

832
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:56,040
- I got to have money.
- Yes, of course. Wait here.

833
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:06,393
I said wait.

834
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,354
<i>Here. Don't thank me.</i>

835
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:13,318
I need more than 10. I need $57.

836
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:16,392
<i>- I don't have it.
- I got family!</i>

837
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:19,597
<i>- There's nothing here.
- Out of my way.</i>

838
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:24,632
- Get out of my way!
- No, no...

839
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:30,511
Let go of that table,
please, sir.

840
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:36,550
Oh, I deserve it. I know I do.
My nose is bleeding.

841
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:42,795
You gonna let go of that table,
or you want a busted skull?

842
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:52,796
Joe... thank you.

843
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:55,349
Operator. Number, please.

844
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,637
- Number, please.
- Hello. Hello.

845
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:01,792
<i>- I wasn't calling anyone.
- Hello?</i>

846
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:04,838
<i>I wasn't calling anyone.</i>

847
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,599
<i>I wasn't calling anyone, Joe...</i>

848
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:26,349
31 hours. 11.30 in the morning,
we get there.

849
01:38:27,680 --> 01:38:31,070
Not this morning,
but the next, at 11.30.

850
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:36,834
- These guys are good drivers.
- They got to be.

851
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:44,996
<i>You didn't kill him, did you?
There's blood on your jacket.</i>

852
01:38:48,920 --> 01:38:50,592
<i>Don't talk about it.</i>

853
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:25,470
If you're shivering,
put your blankets up.

854
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,912
<i>I been thinkin'.</i>

855
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:36,553
<i>I hope we won't have any trouble
about my name down there.</i>

856
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,638
Keep your blankets on.

857
01:39:42,160 --> 01:39:46,392
<i>Can you see this guy
runnin' around with a suntan,</i>

858
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:51,838
<i>goin' in swimmin', and then
somebody yells, "Hey, Ratso!"</i>

859
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:56,870
<i>What's that sound like?</i>

860
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:59,349
Sounds like they knew you.

861
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:03,479
<i>Sounds like crap.
I'm Rico all the time, OK?</i>

862
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:11,200
<i>We'll tell everyone
my name's Rico.</i>

863
01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:16,351
- OK?
- OK.

864
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:53,596
<i>- What's the matter?
- I'm wet.</i>

865
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:58,196
- You're... you're what?
- I wet my pants.

866
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:02,995
Hell, no use crying
over the damn thing.

867
01:41:05,080 --> 01:41:10,108
My leg hurts, my butt hurts,
my chest hurts, my face hurts.

868
01:41:10,200 --> 01:41:13,909
Now I got to pee
all over myself.

869
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:18,790
<i>That's funny?
I'm fallin' apart here.</i>

870
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:22,558
You just took a little rest stop

871
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:25,313
<i>that wasn't on the schedule.</i>

872
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,756
I'll put you up here.

873
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:50,313
What size pants you wear?

874
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:21,272
Hi, honey.

875
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:25,990
- Where you from?
- New York.

876
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:30,829
<i>- Ever been here before?
- It's my first time.</i>

877
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:34,429
- Have a good time in Florida.
- Thanks.

878
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,917
<i>Hey... what are you doin'?</i>

879
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,389
<i>I'm zippin' your fly.</i>

880
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:18,870
- Thanks, Joe.
- These shirts are comfortable.

881
01:43:20,440 --> 01:43:24,319
Yours was the last one
with a palm tree.

882
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:31,991
Clothes are cheap here.

883
01:43:38,440 --> 01:43:41,398
All this only set us back ten.

884
01:43:43,920 --> 01:43:48,835
You know, Ratso...
Rico, I mean...

885
01:43:48,920 --> 01:43:51,434
I got this figured out.

886
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:57,789
<i>When we get to Miami, I'm gonna
get some sort of job, you know?</i>

887
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:03,000
<i>I ain't no hustler. There must
be easier ways to make money.</i>

888
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:08,712
Some sort of outdoors work.
What do you think?

889
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:15,832
<i>That's what I'll do.</i>

890
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,433
OK, Rico?

891
01:45:05,320 --> 01:45:07,880
<i>Everything's fine.
Nothing to worry about.</i>

892
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,672
He kin to you?

893
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:19,959
- Want to close his eyes?
- What?

894
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:22,759
Just close his eyes.

895
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:32,034
Nothing else we can do.

896
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:36,870
Just a little illness.
We'll be in Miamisoon.

897
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:46,437
<i>Nothin' to worry about.
Just a little illness.</i>

898
