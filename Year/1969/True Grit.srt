1
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:50,860
Little Frank, you take care of your mom.

2
00:01:51,028 --> 00:01:52,028
I will.

3
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:02,205
- You're not travelling very heavy, Tom.
- I got all I need.

4
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:11,798
You should be taking the train, Frank.
Fort Smith is too long a ride.

5
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,967
On Judy, 70 miles will be
just a pleasant outing.

6
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,597
Yarnell, I know you'll take
good care of the place for me.

7
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,265
You and my Mattie.

8
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:26,270
- Where is Mattie?
- I'm in here, Papa.

9
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:35,488
Well, little bookkeeper,
you got my wherewithal ready?

10
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,241
- Of course.
- How much are you allowing?

11
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,911
There's right around...

12
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,165
...$150 cash money.

13
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,920
You better hand me
my good luck gold pieces, too.

14
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,422
Buying Texas mustang ponies,

15
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,217
you're gonna need more luck
than they put in at the mint.

16
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,594
You'll come around to my plan.

17
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,806
I intend to buy as many ponies
as I can swing.

18
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,474
We'll breed them for deer hunting.

19
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:07,979
I don't think much of Texas ponies.
They're small and chicken-brained.

20
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,856
I'd say small and tough.

21
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,400
Just right for keeping up with dogs
through the brush.

22
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,611
- You want my advice, papa?
- I always do.

23
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:19,282
- Buy the ponies cheap.
- I expect to.

24
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:24,412
This Colonel Stonehill, he's got to
get rid of them before winter sets in.

25
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,539
Papa, that gun's old-fashioned.

26
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,624
Why don't you buy a new one
in Fort Smith?

27
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:33,004
It served me well at Chickamauga.
It's got a long way to go yet.

28
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:47,310
Goodbye, Papa.

29
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,404
Tom Chaney,
now there's trash for you.

30
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,324
He should have stayed here and
looked after the place, it's his job.

31
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,910
After all, papa took him in
when he was starving

32
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,369
and gave him a house to live in.

33
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:09,123
Come, Mattie,
it's only an old tool shed.

34
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,959
You can still throw a cat
through the south wall.

35
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:14,503
It's got a good roof.

36
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,260
- This game's crooked.
- What do you mean?

37
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,179
You've been dealing me seconds!

38
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:29,018
Goddamn crooks!
You've been stacking the decks!

39
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,816
Aw, come on, Tom.

40
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,027
We got our business done, we want
to make an early start for home.

41
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,695
I don't think it's happening here.

42
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,198
Them card sharks is cheatin' me.
I wanna get my money back.

43
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,575
Not full of whisky and with a gun,
that's no way.

44
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,202
A gun'll say a whole lot quick.

45
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:48,871
You work for me,
I won't allow you to get in trouble.

46
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,917
- Give me your gun.
- I'll give you one end of it.

47
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,671
Give me that gun. Give me your gun.

48
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,076
All aboard!

49
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,665
Can you tell me where
the undertaker is?

50
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,376
Around the corner
from the courthouse, ma'am.

51
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:36,961
Thank you.

52
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,928
Can't understand
all these people being here.

53
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,098
Man on the train told me everybody
comin' here from every place.

54
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,558
I'd like to know why.

55
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:53,185
They're hanging three men today
at the courthouse.

56
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,855
We better go and see about papa.

57
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,247
I'll get you!

58
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,841
Man out rustling up business
for himself, looks like.

59
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:29,430
Seems like we have us a lot of time
to waste before we see anybody much.

60
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:34,310
I can tell what you want, Yarnell.
You want to go to that hanging.

61
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,521
'Fraid I can't.
Your mama said to keep an eye on you.

62
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,070
Well, I'll go along.
Don't worry, I won't tell mama.

63
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:20,147
Who wants peanuts?! Fresh!

64
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,861
Hot tamales!

65
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,492
That man up there on the porch...

66
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:39,959
That's Judge Parker.
He watches all the hangings.

67
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:44,588
- He says it's his sense of duty.
- Who knows what's in a man's heart?

68
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,147
Hangman's a Yankee.

69
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,483
They say he won't spring the trap
on a boy that wore the blue.

70
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,825
No, I'm here. I'll see it all.

71
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,503
My goodness.

72
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,851
That's not a faint-hearted judge.

73
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,229
Chaney would get his due
before such a judge.

74
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,713
Is that the man?

75
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,760
That is my father.

76
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,641
If you would like to kiss him,
it will be all right.

77
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,146
No.

78
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:30,319
Put the lid on it.

79
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,167
I'm Mattie Ross
of near Dardanelle in Yell County,

80
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:31,922
and this is my friend, Yarnell
Poindexter, he works on our place.

81
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,966
Yes, ma'am.
State your business.

82
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:39,471
My father was killed in Fort Smith
by a coward named Tom Chaney.

83
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,557
I'm here to find out
what you're doing about the murder.

84
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:46,228
Well, we do know this much: his name's
Chambers, he's now in Indian territory,

85
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,897
we think he was with Lucky Ned Pepper
robbing a mail hack

86
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,483
Tuesday down on the Poteau River,

87
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,236
he's a medium-height man
with a black mark on his cheek.

88
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:59,033
That's a description of Tom Chaney,
there's no Chambers to it.

89
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,744
He got that black mark
when a man fired a pistol in his face

90
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,704
and the powder got under the skin.

91
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,416
Why aren't you out looking for him?

92
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:11,003
I have no authority
in the Indian Nation.

93
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:14,340
He's now the business
of the US marshal.

94
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,008
Who's the best marshal they have?

95
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,095
Bill Waters is the best tracker.

96
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:24,725
The meanest one is Rooster Cogburn,
a pitiless man, double tough,

97
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:28,312
fear don't enter into his thinking.
I'd have to say L.T. Quinn

98
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,522
is the straightest,
he brings his prisoners in alive.

99
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,316
Where would I find this Rooster?

100
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:35,736
He'll be at the federal court
this afternoon.

101
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:38,572
His bringing in a load of prisoners
from the territory.

102
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,868
- Is Chaney one of them?
- I don't know, that's federal business.

103
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:46,413
Your father's gun, you'll...

104
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,625
...want to take it home, I expect.

105
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:53,921
His saddle is at Colonel Stonehill's
stock barn

106
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:56,632
and the rest of his things
are at the Monarch Boarding House.

107
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:01,387
I won't rest until Tom Chaney's
barking in hell.

108
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:10,813
Yarnell...

109
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,316
...you stay with Papa.

110
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,903
When you get him home,
you put him in a better coffin,

111
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,696
and you bury him in Mason's apron.

112
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,740
Your mama ain't gonna like you
not coming home with me.

113
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,284
Mama knows I can take care of myself.

114
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,454
And tell her not to sign anything
until I get back.

115
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,917
People will take it wrong
that I leave this to you, Yarnell,

116
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,294
but I got Papa's business to attend to.

117
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,506
Now, you tell Mama that I'm staying at
the Monarch Boarding House

118
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,676
and I'm gonna stop over and see
if Tom Chaney's one of the prisoners.

119
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,929
And then I'll see this Rooster Cogburn.

120
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,360
All right, get outta the way!
Back up!

121
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,820
Back up!

122
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,207
Stand up!

123
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,751
Come on out!

124
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:20,424
Move along!

125
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,718
Are those the prisoners
from the Indian territory?

126
00:13:22,886 --> 00:13:24,386
Yes, ma'am.

127
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,472
Do you know if any one of them
is Tom Chaney?

128
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,765
Cogburn ain't turned in his list yet.

129
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:34,229
- Which marshal is Rooster Cogburn?
- The big fella with the eye patch.

130
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,486
Come on!

131
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,409
All right, take it away!

132
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:50,287
- Mr. Cogburn!
- Wait! You come back here!

133
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,790
Mr. Cogburn! Mr. Cogburn!

134
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,626
I said you come back here!

135
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:01,048
All right, come on up.

136
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,926
If Mr. Cogburn thinks I'm gonna be put
off by a locked door,

137
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,929
he does not know me!
I will be here when it opens.

138
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,014
When it opens,
you're gonna be mighty hungry.

139
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,683
Best time for you to nail Rooster
would be tomorrow.

140
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,520
He's due to testify before Judge Parker
in the Wharton case.

141
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,907
Thank you very much.
I appreciate your kindness.

142
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,047
Have some more dumplings, dear?

143
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,469
At the rate of 25 cents per meal,
I might just as well.

144
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,933
I was hoping you were
enjoying the dumplings.

145
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:57,813
They're all right. I can't see 25 cents
in a little flour and grease.

146
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,533
- You're late, Mr. La Boof.
- The French is "La Boeuf,"

147
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,993
I call it "La Beef".

148
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,836
Mr. La Boeuf came in this evening.

149
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,131
Your spurs, please.

150
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,967
My poor chairs are scratched
enough already.

151
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,899
A right fancy rig, sir.

152
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,321
Watch out
for the chicken and dumplings.

153
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,282
- They'll hurt your eyes.
- How's that?

154
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,951
They'll hurt your eyes
looking for the chicken!

155
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,040
You squirrel-headed bastard!

156
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,295
Howdy. What's your name?

157
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:09,134
I'd like to go to bed now. But first
I'd like to see my father's traps.

158
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:23,774
I'll take a guess
and say your name is Mattie Ross.

159
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,954
- This Mr. La Boeuf is a handsome man.
- He needs a bath and a shave.

160
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,790
He hails from Texas.

161
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,167
Judge he's right proud
of his cowlick.

162
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,211
How do you suppose
he guessed my name?

163
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,505
He's a good guesser, I guess!

164
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,385
We're short of rooms
on account of the hanging.

165
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,679
But you'll sleep in here
with Grandma Turner.

166
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,307
Now, don't you worry about Grandma
Turner, she's used to doubling up.

167
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,268
I take it my rent will be half, then?

168
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:05,607
This is your father's traps.
The watch and the knife are inside.

169
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,443
The man Chaney stole his money
and his horse.

170
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,710
What is your opinion of a federal
marshal called Rooster Cogburn?

171
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:29,756
Rooster Cogburn! Lord, I've heard
some terrible things about him!

172
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,300
He loves to pull a cork, I know that!

173
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,290
His Honour, Judge Parker!
All rise!

174
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:52,422
I'll have a peppermint
to settle my stomach.

175
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,216
Yes, sir. Right, sir.

176
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,022
The United States Court
of the western district,

177
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,485
having criminal jurisdiction in the
Indian territory, is now in session.

178
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,071
Is that Judge Parker,
the hanging judge?

179
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:19,866
Yeah. He's a tough customer.
There's no appeal from his court

180
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,661
except to the President
of the United States!

181
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,998
Call Deputy Marshal Cogburn.

182
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:31,044
Mr. Reuben J. Cogburn
will take the stand.

183
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:43,139
Sworn this morning,
you're still sworn. Take the stand.

184
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,975
Defence will cross-examine.

185
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:56,278
Mr. Cogburn, you testified
for the prosecution this morning.

186
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,824
Now, in order to refresh our memories,
allow me to summarise what you said.

187
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,493
According to your story...

188
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:07,581
...C. C. Wharton grabbed a shotgun
and killed Marshal Potter.

189
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:12,043
Then he turned the gun on you,
you say, and you shot him.

190
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:16,798
Then you say the father swung his axe,
and you shot him, too.

191
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:21,803
The defendant here tried to run,
you say, and you also shot him.

192
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:25,265
Just winged him,
or he wouldn't be here to pay up.

193
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:28,977
The old man and C.C.
hit the ground dead.

194
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,690
How long have you been
a deputy marshal, Mr. Cogburn?

195
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,734
Four years, come March.

196
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,613
How many men have you shot
in that time?

197
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,574
- The prosecution objects!
- Overruled!

198
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:49,289
How many men have you shot since you
became a marshal, Mr. Cogburn?

199
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:54,336
- I never shot nobody I didn't have to!
- That was not the question. How many?

200
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,422
Shot or killed?

201
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,468
Let's restrict it to killed, so we
may have a manageable figure!

202
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:06,264
Well, 12 to 15, stopping men
in flight and defending myself.

203
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:11,144
Twelve to fifteen? So many that
you cannot keep a specific count.

204
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,855
I have examined the records,
Mr. Cogburn.

205
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:18,193
A much more accurate figure is
available. Come now, how many?

206
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:22,113
Counting them two Whartons, 23.

207
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:25,116
I felt you would come to it
with a little effort.

208
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:30,288
Twenty-three dead men in four years.
That makes about six men a year!

209
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,873
It's a dangerous business.

210
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:35,627
How much more dangerous
for those arrested by you?

211
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:40,465
Now, is it not true that you sprang upon
old man Wharton and his two sons

212
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,926
with a deadly six-shot revolver
in your hand?

213
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:47,889
- I always try to be ready.
- Was this revolver loaded and cocked?

214
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,059
A gun that's unloaded and cocked
ain't good for nothing!

215
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:53,061
Just answer my questions, if you please.

216
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:58,817
- Well, the question don't make sense!
- Don't bandy words with counsel.

217
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,568
Yes, sir.

218
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,947
I believe you testified that
you backed away from old man Wharton.

219
00:22:04,115 --> 00:22:06,741
- Yes, sir.
- Which direction were you going?

220
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:10,286
Backward! I always go backward
when I'm backing away!

221
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,747
I appreciate the humour of that remark.

222
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,418
Aaron Wharton was standing by a pot
when you arrived?

223
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:20,964
More like squatting. He was stirring
the fire under the scalding pot.

224
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:26,011
- How far did you back away?
- Six, eight steps.

225
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:30,932
Meaning Wharton advanced on you the
same distance? Six or eight steps?

226
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,935
- Say about 16 feet?
- Something like that.

227
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:38,106
Then will you explain why the body was
found immediately by the wash pot,

228
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:42,235
one arm in the flames,
the sleeve and hand smouldering?

229
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:46,656
Them hogs. They was rooting around,
they may have moved the body.

230
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,535
Hogs, indeed.

231
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:54,456
Mr. Goudy, do you have anymore
questions for Mr. Cogburn?

232
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,293
None that I'll get a straight answer to.
I'm finished with him.

233
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,795
You're dismissed, Mr. Cogburn.

234
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,964
Call the next witness!

235
00:23:06,302 --> 00:23:08,970
Cecil Falling Leaf, take the stand!

236
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,312
Raise your right hand.

237
00:23:24,278 --> 00:23:27,030
- Mr. Rooster Cogburn?
- What is it?

238
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,657
I'd like to talk with you a minute.

239
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,243
They tell me you're a man
with true grit.

240
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,329
Well, what do you want? Speak up!

241
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,666
You've already wrinkled the paper.

242
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,211
It's pretty loose
because your makings are too dry.

243
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,677
- I'm looking for Tom Chaney.
- Well, who's he?

244
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:53,056
He shot and killed my father,
Frank Ross.

245
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,808
They tell me he's in
the Indian territory

246
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,518
and I need somebody
to go after him.

247
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,770
- Well, who are you?
- Mattie Ross.

248
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,356
My family has 480 acres
of good bottomland

249
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:03,358
near Dardanelle in Yell County.

250
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:06,653
My mother's home looking after my baby
sister and my brother, Little Frank.

251
00:24:06,821 --> 00:24:10,323
Well then, why don't you go home
and leave me alone?

252
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,826
They'll need help with the churning.

253
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,375
Mr. Cogburn!

254
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,465
You can get a fugitive warrant
for Tom Chaney

255
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,968
and the government will give you two
dollars for bringing him in,

256
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:34,764
plus ten cents a mile for each of you,
and I'll give you $50 reward.

257
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:37,142
Well, you've looked into this
right smart.

258
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:41,521
- Yes, I have. I mean business.
- What have you got there in your poke?

259
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:48,403
By God, girl, that's a Colt's Dragoon!

260
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:52,574
You're no bigger than a corn nubbin.
What are you doing with all this pistol?

261
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:55,827
It belonged to my father.
He carried it bravely in the war

262
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:59,497
and I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it,
if the law fails to do so.

263
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,416
Well this'll sure get the job done,

264
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:07,297
if you can find a fence post
to rest it on while you take aim!

265
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,553
I'm afraid nothing's gonna be done
about Chaney unless I do it myself.

266
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,014
I don't think you've got $50.

267
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:19,100
I've got some horse-trading to do,
I'll have it by tomorrow.

268
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:22,520
Do you know a robber
by the name of Lucky Ned Pepper?

269
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,607
I know him... well!

270
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:30,320
I shot him in the lip last August
over at Winding Stair Mountains.

271
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,948
He was lucky that day all right,
my shooting was off.

272
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:36,451
Well, I think Tom Chaney's
tied up with him.

273
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,120
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

274
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,672
- Ned Pepper, huh?
- Yeah.

275
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:55,637
Well, baby sister,
I don't think you can get $50.

276
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,181
But if you're hungry,
I'll take you home and give you supper.

277
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:01,851
We'll talk it over.
Make medicine. How does that suit you?

278
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:05,980
Right down to the ground.
I'd like to meet your family.

279
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:30,505
This is my father, Chen Lee,
and my nephew, General Sterling Price.

280
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,523
You want more, missy?

281
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:51,859
I've had enough,
and enough is good as a feast.

282
00:26:52,987 --> 00:26:55,363
I've never seen chopsticks work before.

283
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,700
Chopsticks save your fingers.

284
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:14,173
- Give me your cup.
- I don't drink coffee, thank you.

285
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,009
Well, now, what do you drink?

286
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,053
I'm partial to cold buttermilk.

287
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,350
Well, we ain't got none of that.
We ain't got no lemonade, neither.

288
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,104
Let's get to the game.

289
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,413
- My deal?
- Yes, sir.

290
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:48,708
- What about my proposition?
- I'm thinking on it.

291
00:27:48,876 --> 00:27:51,919
Sounds like a mighty easy way
to make $50 to me.

292
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,465
Don't crowd me. I'm figuring expenses.

293
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,260
Don't see how you can play cards
and drink whiskey

294
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,971
and think of this detective business
all at the same time.

295
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:05,558
Well, I'll tell you one thing,
if I have to go up against Ned Pepper,

296
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:08,686
it'll cost $100.
I figured that much out.

297
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:12,648
- And $50 in advance.
- You're trying to take advantage of me.

298
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,651
I'm giving you my children's rates.

299
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,821
It isn't going to be easy
smoking old Ned out.

300
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:22,116
He'll be holed up
down in that Indian Nation.

301
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,453
Well, I hope you don't think
I'm going to keep you in whiskey.

302
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:30,124
I don't buy that, I confiscate it.

303
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,461
A touch of it wouldn't do you any harm
against the night air.

304
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:34,712
No, thank you.

305
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,050
Well, it's the real article.
Genuine, double-rectified busthead.

306
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,593
Aged in the keg.

307
00:28:41,178 --> 00:28:44,514
I would not put a thief in my mouth
to steal my brains.

308
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:50,728
Well, sis, my price is $100.
There it is. Want to make medicine?

309
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,439
I will think about your proposition
and talk to you again.

310
00:28:53,607 --> 00:28:55,400
Now, I wanna go
to the Monarch Boarding House.

311
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,859
You better walk me over there.

312
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,654
You are a lot of trouble.

313
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,490
Wait till I finish this hand.

314
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:09,080
You can never tell
what's in a Chinaman's mind.

315
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,582
That's the way he bests you at cards.

316
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:15,878
I go.

317
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,761
Scat!

318
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,350
Mr. Rat...

319
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,686
...I have a writ here

320
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:35,189
says you're to stop eating
Chen Lee's cornmeal forthwith.

321
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:42,155
Now, it's a rat writ, writ for a rat,
and this is lawful service of same.

322
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,783
See? Doesn't pay any attention to me.

323
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:53,249
- Outside is place for shooting!
- I'm serving some papers.

324
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:17,064
That was your job in the first place.

325
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,864
You can't serve papers on a rat,
baby sister.

326
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,034
You got to kill him or let him be.

327
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:31,412
- What's your thoughts on it?
- You going to drink all of that?

328
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:37,710
Judge Parker, old carpetbagger,
but he knows his rats.

329
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:43,591
We had a good court going around here
'til them pettifogging lawyers moved in.

330
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:49,597
A rat catcher's too tough on the rats.
"Give them rats a fair show," they say.

331
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:53,351
Well, what kind of a fair show
did they give old man Potter?

332
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,021
Tell me that.
Finer man never lived.

333
00:30:57,189 --> 00:31:01,734
You're useless in this condition.
I'll walk over there by myself.

334
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,612
- You scared of the dark?
- I've never been scared of the dark.

335
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,114
Well, if I had a big horse pistol
like that,

336
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:11,369
- I wouldn't be scared of no boogerman.
- I'm not scared of no boogerman.

337
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:21,629
- Sugar?
- No, thanks.

338
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,881
- Cream?
- Please.

339
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,634
Just a dab.

340
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,344
Oh, Miss Ross.

341
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:31,639
I've been waiting
to have some private words with you.

342
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,224
And you, dear lady,

343
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:36,602
I find a sweet distraction,
as I suppose most men do.

344
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,814
- Will you excuse us?
- Why, of course, Mr. La Boeuf.

345
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:49,740
What do you want of me?
Who are you?

346
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:53,619
- Nobody yet, but I expect to go high.
- How?

347
00:31:54,788 --> 00:31:57,540
Well, to begin with,
I expect to marry well.

348
00:31:57,708 --> 00:31:59,917
Well, you have the hair combed for it.

349
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:02,086
How'd you know my name
was Mattie Ross?

350
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:04,672
I saw your mother yesterday.

351
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:07,508
What business did you have with her?

352
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,386
This.

353
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,722
Can you identify the man
in this picture?

354
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,182
It's a likeness of Tom Chaney.

355
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,185
There's no black mark on his face,
but that's him.

356
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,981
I'm looking for him
and I hear you're looking for him, too.

357
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:23,441
I know all about your father.

358
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,527
How come you didn't
show me this last night when we met?

359
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:29,947
I only take one step at a time.
That's why I was given two feet.

360
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,867
His real name is Theron Chelmsford.

361
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:35,995
He shot and killed a state senator
named Bibbs down in Waco, Texas.

362
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,331
I've been on his trail
the best part of four months now.

363
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,166
- You some kind of law?
- Yeah.

364
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:42,376
I'm a sergeant in the Texas Rangers.

365
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:44,879
I'm working for the family
of the late Senator Bibbs.

366
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,714
Chelmsford or Chaney as you call him,

367
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:50,426
he shot and killed the Senator's bird
dog. Bibbs threatened to whip him,

368
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:53,346
and Chaney shot the old gentleman
while he was sitting in a porch swing.

369
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:57,266
Well, you need not worry about Chaney
anymore. I aim to have him hanged.

370
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,352
The sheriff informed me
that you were looking for a man

371
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,687
to go after Chaney
in the Indian territory.

372
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:05,191
I've already found one for the job.
His name is Rooster Cogburn.

373
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,236
He's a deputy marshal for the federal
court, toughest one they have.

374
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,239
Maybe I'll throw in with you
and your federal marshal.

375
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,283
You'll have to talk that over
with Rooster Cogburn.

376
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:18,245
It's to our mutual advantage.
He knows the land, and I know Chaney.

377
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,040
It's at least a two-man job
to take him alive.

378
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:24,126
And I must have him alive
down to McLennan County, Texas.

379
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,921
When we get Chaney,
we're not taking him back to Texas.

380
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:28,756
We're taking him
to Fort Smith and hang.

381
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,800
Is it important where he hangs?

382
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:33,094
- It is to me.
- Well, more so to me.

383
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,929
There's a well-placed
young lady in Waco

384
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:37,765
who'd look with favour on me
if I brought in Chaney.

385
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,184
Now, wouldn't a hanging in Texas
serve you just as well

386
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,228
- as the hanging in Fort Smith?
- No.

387
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:44,772
I want Tom Chaney to pay
for killing my father,

388
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,607
not for some Texas bird dog.

389
00:33:46,775 --> 00:33:48,234
It won't be for the dog.

390
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:52,613
It'll be for the senator and your father
too. Chaney will be just as dead.

391
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:55,616
Well, if in four months
I could not find Tom Chaney

392
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,535
with a mark on his face
like banished Cain,

393
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:59,203
I would not advise others how to do it.

394
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:02,415
A little earlier, I gave some thought
to stealing a kiss from you,

395
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:06,544
although you are very young
and you're unattractive to boot.

396
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:10,005
But now I'm of a mind to give you
five or six good licks with my belt.

397
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,133
One would be as
unpleasant as the other.

398
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,178
Lay a hand on me and you'll answer for
it. You Texans are ignorant of our ways.

399
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:19,682
Good people of this state don't go easy
on men who abuse women and children.

400
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:21,726
The children of Texans are brought up

401
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,853
to show a little more respect
for their elders.

402
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,480
I also noticed that people
of your state gouge their horses

403
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,525
with great brutal spurs
and cultivate their hair like lettuce.

404
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,695
You'll push that saucy line too far.

405
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,613
Mr. La Boeuf, I have no regard for you,

406
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,533
but I'm sure you have enough
for yourself to go around.

407
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,339
They are all for sale...

408
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,343
...except those four scrubby ones.

409
00:34:57,387 --> 00:35:02,183
- And, who do they belong to?
- The heirs of the late Frank Ross.

410
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,684
I'm Mattie Ross.

411
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:06,395
I'd like to sell you back those ponies
that my father bought.

412
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:08,439
I fear that is out of the question.

413
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,317
My father bought those
ponies for breeding.

414
00:35:11,485 --> 00:35:13,527
Now, I've looked at them,
and they're all geldings.

415
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:16,071
You cannot breed geldings.

416
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,533
That hardly concerns me.
Your father bought four ponies

417
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,869
and paid $100 for them,
and there's an end of it.

418
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:25,664
I want $300 for Papa's saddle horse
that was stolen from your barn.

419
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,458
You'll have to take that up
with the man who stole it.

420
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:31,378
Tom Chaney stole it while it was
in your care. You are responsible.

421
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:36,133
I admire your sand, but I am not liable.

422
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:40,095
- I will take it to the law.
- You must do as you think best.

423
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,264
We will see if a widow
and three small children

424
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,725
can get fair treatment
in the courts of this city.

425
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,938
- You have no case.
- Lawyer J. Noble Daggett of Dardanelle

426
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:52,149
- in Yell County may think otherwise.
- You are impudent.

427
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:55,194
I do not wish to be, sir,
but I will not be pushed about

428
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:56,612
when I'm in the right.

429
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,531
I'll take it up with my attorney.

430
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,991
And I will take it up with mine.
Lawyer Daggett.

431
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,077
And he will make money,
and I will make money,

432
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,745
and your lawyer will make money.

433
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,915
And you, Mr. Licensed Auctioneer,
you will foot the bill.

434
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,209
You are a damn nuisance.

435
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:13,254
Lawyer Daggett? Lawyer Daggett?
Who is this famous pleader

436
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,798
whose name I was happily ignorant
of 10 minutes ago?

437
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:16,966
Have you ever heard

438
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,553
of the Great Arkansas River Vicksburg
and Gulf and Steamship Company?

439
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,138
I have done business
with the G.A.V. & G., yes.

440
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:26,183
Well, he was the one
that forced them into receivership.

441
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:28,352
They tried to mess with him.

442
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,065
All right. Come inside.

443
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,113
Sit down.

444
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:48,122
I will pay a total of $200
to your father's estate

445
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:53,043
when I have in my hand a letter
absolving me of all liability

446
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:55,296
from the beginning of the world to date.

447
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,715
I want $200 for Papa's horse, Judy,

448
00:36:57,883 --> 00:37:01,093
plus another $100 for the ponies.
That's $300 total.

449
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,928
The ponies have no part in this.

450
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,513
I will not buy them back.

451
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:08,392
Then I'll keep the ponies and
the price for Judy alone will be $300.

452
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,437
Three hun... I wouldn't
pay that for a winged Pegasus.

453
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:15,107
Now, listen very carefully,
as I will not bargain further.

454
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:19,069
I will take the ponies back,
and keep your father's saddle,

455
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,821
and settle for $200.

456
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:25,326
My lawyer would not wish me to
consider anything under $300.

457
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,661
For that, you get everything
except the saddle.

458
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:35,169
I would like to have that in writing,
for what it is worth.

459
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:40,049
When I have it in my hand,
I'll remit the extortion money.

460
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:43,886
Now, this is your release.
You'll find it in order.

461
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:46,180
You had that already written out.

462
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,685
- I'll give you a check.
- I prefer cash.

463
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:03,489
One hundred. Two hundred.
Three hundred.

464
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:14,833
Now, I'm sure you'll find a buyer
for those ponies very soon.

465
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:20,089
I have a tentative offer of $10 a head
from the soap works at Little Rock.

466
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:23,050
It seems such a shame to render
such spirited horseflesh into soap.

467
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,636
I'm confident the deal
will fall through.

468
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:29,098
- You can expect me back for my saddle.
- I'm sure I can.

469
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,062
Do you know
a Marshal Rooster Cogburn?

470
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,232
Most people around here
have heard of Rooster Cogburn,

471
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,734
and some people live to regret it.

472
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:44,113
I would not be surprised to learn
that he's a relative of yours.

473
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,292
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

474
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,798
- Where's Rooster Cogburn?
- Sleep late. Very drunk last night.

475
00:39:18,815 --> 00:39:22,776
I've never seen anybody in bed
at 10:00 in the morning who wasn't sick.

476
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:27,322
Coffee.

477
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:42,463
You ain't such
an early bird yourself, baby sister.

478
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,716
I just about give up on you.
I figured you'd gone home.

479
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,926
You need some more slats in that bed.

480
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:51,513
Yeah. Well, trouble is,
there's no slats in it at all.

481
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:56,060
Some kind of a damn
Chinese rope bed torture contraption.

482
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,311
I'd like to burn it...

483
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,481
God, don't you got it.
How much is there?

484
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,232
You still game?

485
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,320
Baby sister, I was born game
and I intend to go out that way.

486
00:40:06,488 --> 00:40:08,155
All right. One understanding,

487
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:11,241
that we leave for the territory
this afternoon to get Tom Chaney.

488
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,494
- Well, you're not going.
- You've misjudged me.

489
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:18,332
I can't go up against Ned Pepper's gang
and try and take care of a baby

490
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,793
- all at the same time.
- I'm not a baby.

491
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:24,546
You'll slow me down. There's no hot
grub or warm beds out there.

492
00:40:24,714 --> 00:40:26,173
I've slept out at night before.

493
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:27,758
Papa took me
coon hunting last summer.

494
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:31,512
Well, this ain't no coon hunt and
It's no place for a shirttailed kid.

495
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,388
That's what they said
about coon hunting.

496
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,849
First night out,
you'd be calling, "Mama! Mama!"

497
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:39,269
I've left off crying.
Now make up your mind.

498
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,605
I'm aimed to get Tom Chaney
and if you're not game,

499
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,065
I'll find somebody who is.

500
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,360
Now, I know you can drink whiskey
and I saw you kill a rat.

501
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:48,987
But all the rest has been talk.
I'm not paying for talk.

502
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,948
I can get all the talk I need
at the Monarch Boarding House.

503
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:52,825
I ought to paddle your rump.

504
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:57,204
I don't know how you propose to do that
from the hog wallow you're sunk into.

505
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,999
If I smelled as bad as you,
I wouldn't live near people.

506
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,418
I've made up a short agreement here
between us.

507
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:05,838
Sign it.

508
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:08,757
And here's $25.

509
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:15,889
I'll give you another $25 when we leave
and $50 when the job is done.

510
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:22,938
Well, I guess we can get started
at first light. We'll cross the ferry.

511
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:26,191
I want to talk to an informer
in the Indian Nation.

512
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,485
Might know something.

513
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,904
I'll be more than ready.

514
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,451
Well, General...

515
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,580
...look what we got.

516
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:09,401
There's an old saw that says,
"One white foot, buy them...

517
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,070
...two white feet, try them.

518
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:15,115
Three white feet, be on the sly...

519
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:18,160
...four white feet, pass them by".

520
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,331
But I do not hold with that.

521
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,856
I just received word that a young girl

522
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:51,109
fell head first into a 50-foot well
on the Towsend road.

523
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,153
I thought perhaps it was you.

524
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,657
No, it was not I.

525
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:59,159
What do you hear
from the Little Rock soap man?

526
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:00,452
Nothing.

527
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,997
Well, I'll take one of those ponies
off your hands,

528
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:07,960
the black one with the white stockings.
I will call him Little Blackie.

529
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,670
What is your offer?

530
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,214
I will pay the market price.

531
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:14,633
I believe the soap man offered you
$10 a head.

532
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:15,926
That is a lot price.

533
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,846
You will recall, I paid you $25 a head
only this morning.

534
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,682
That was the market price at that time.

535
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:22,891
Tell me this...

536
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:27,104
...do you entertain plans
of ever leaving this city?

537
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,857
Yes. I'm off early tomorrow morning
for the Indian Nation.

538
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:34,444
Marshal Rooster Cogburn and I are
going after the murderer Tom Chaney.

539
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:40,701
Cogburn. How did you light
on that greasy vagabond?

540
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:42,911
They say he has grit.

541
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:48,041
- I wanted a man with grit.
- Well, I suppose he has that.

542
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:50,294
He's a notorious thumper.

543
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,587
He's not a man
I would care to share a bed with.

544
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:56,508
- Nor would I.
- I wouldn't trust him too much.

545
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,760
I have only paid him a token payment.

546
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:00,971
The balance will be paid
when the job is done.

547
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:03,890
It may prove to be a long, hard journey.

548
00:44:04,851 --> 00:44:07,227
A good Christian
does not flinch from these difficulties.

549
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,855
Neither does he rashly court them.

550
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:13,483
The good Christian
is not wilful or presumptuous.

551
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:17,571
- You think I'm wrong?
- I think you are wrong-headed.

552
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,075
I will pay you $12 for that pony,

553
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:26,413
if you shoe him for me.
I will not ride a barefoot pony.

554
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,131
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

555
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:43,096
- Howdy.
- What are you doing here?

556
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,766
I'm having a little conversation
with the marshal.

557
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,435
Sit down, sis. Have some taffy.

558
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:52,439
This jaybird says he's on the track
of the same man we're after,

559
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,107
like to throw in with us.

560
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:56,985
I've already told him
we're not interested in his help.

561
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,278
He's gone behind my back.

562
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,991
Well, a fellow that
carries a big-bore Sharps Carbine

563
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,743
might come in handy,

564
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:08,080
if we get jumped by elephants
or buffalo or something.

565
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,623
We don't need him.

566
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,126
- Got everything ready?
- All but the grub.

567
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,420
I reckon I must have the wrong man.

568
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,798
Do you let little girls
hurrah you, Cogburn?

569
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:20,759
Would you mind repeating that, jaybird?

570
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:23,345
There's no hurrahing in it.
The marshal's working for me.

571
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:25,222
- How much she paying you?
- Enough.

572
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,682
Is she paying you $500?

573
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:30,685
No.

574
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,479
That's what the Governor of Texas
has put up

575
00:45:32,647 --> 00:45:35,399
for this man she calls Chaney.
Payment on conviction.

576
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,192
- Five hundred dollars?
- Yep.

577
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,653
Very little for a man
who's killed a senator.

578
00:45:39,821 --> 00:45:41,321
Bibbs was a little senator.

579
00:45:42,824 --> 00:45:44,908
Well, I guess I'll just stick with sis.

580
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:48,370
The Bibbs family's
put up another $1,500 for Chaney.

581
00:45:48,538 --> 00:45:50,288
Have they now. What are the terms?

582
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,542
Just deliver Chaney.
They don't care if he's alive or dead.

583
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,627
That's more to my liking.

584
00:45:56,546 --> 00:45:58,380
How you figuring
on splitting up the money?

585
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:01,466
Well, if we take him alive,
I'll split the $1,500 with you

586
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:04,136
and keep the state reward of $500
for myself.

587
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:07,389
If we have to kill him, I'll give you
$500 of the Bibbs' money.

588
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:10,684
This man wants to take Chaney
back to Texas. That's not what I want.

589
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:12,644
He wants him caught and punished,
so do you.

590
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:15,355
I want Tom Chaney to hang
for killing my father.

591
00:46:15,523 --> 00:46:18,066
It's little to me how many dogs
and senators he killed in Texas.

592
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:21,903
Well, you can tell him to his face,
you can spit in his eye,

593
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:24,448
you can make him eat sand
out of the road,

594
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,908
you can shoot him in the foot,
and I'll hold him for you.

595
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,869
But first, we got to catch him.

596
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:31,872
You got to learn you can't have
everything your own way.

597
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,332
When I bought and paid for something,
I'll have it my way.

598
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,960
I don't understand
this conversation at all.

599
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:38,837
She ain't going, anyhow.

600
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,173
You run along home, little britches,
your mama wants you.

601
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,258
- I told her she could go.
- No.

602
00:46:43,426 --> 00:46:44,551
She'll make nothing but trouble.

603
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:49,097
Maybe I'll catch this Chaney by myself
and take all the money.

604
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:53,560
You might deliver him, but I'd see to it
that you didn't collect a thing for it.

605
00:46:53,728 --> 00:46:55,228
How'd you go about that?

606
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:58,023
I'd dispute your claim,
I'd muddy up the water.

607
00:46:58,191 --> 00:46:59,774
You do that and I'll kill you.

608
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,945
I wouldn't count too much on being able
to shade somebody I didn't know, fellow.

609
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:10,243
I ain't never seen
nobody from Texas I couldn't shade.

610
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,078
La Boeuf, you get crossways of me,

611
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,290
and you'll think
a thousand of brick have fell on you.

612
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,918
You'll wished you was
back at the Alamo with Travis.

613
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,920
- Knock him down, Rooster.
- Stay out of this.

614
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,630
That reward money's
just a pig in the poke.

615
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:24,591
All La Boeuf is, is talk.
I've given you good cash money.

616
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,468
Look at him grin, he'll cheat you.

617
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:30,013
Fellow's got to think about himself
once in a while, baby sister.

618
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:32,641
We'll get your man,
that's the main thing.

619
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:36,811
Give me my $25 back.
Hand it over.

620
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,106
I spent it.

621
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,570
- You sorry piece of trash.
- I'll get it for you.

622
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:47,197
- I'll send it to you.
- That's a big story.

623
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:48,782
If you think you can cheat me
you're mistaken.

624
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:50,367
You've not heard the last
of Mattie Ross.

625
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,786
You may well hear
from my lawyer, Daggett.

626
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:03,547
Lawyer Daggett?
Who's Lawyer Daggett?

627
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:07,092
I wouldn't worry about him.
I'd worry about our business at hand.

628
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:54,014
- Red.
- Good morning.

629
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,476
- The river looks kind of high.
- Yeah. It's been raining upcountry.

630
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,437
Who you looking for this time, Marshal?

631
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:03,982
Well now, Red, if I was
to tell you that, you might tell him.

632
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:17,704
Well, you're well-enough armed.
I would say, "Tom Chaney, look out".

633
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,460
Can't you get anything through
your head? You're not going.

634
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,931
Forget about the freight, Paddy,
and take us on across.

635
00:49:39,477 --> 00:49:41,061
You're not getting on this ferry.

636
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:43,104
This is open to the public.

637
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:45,273
I have paid my 10 cents
for horse and rider.

638
00:49:45,441 --> 00:49:47,525
Red, take this girl into town
to the sheriff.

639
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,986
She's a runaway.
There's also a $50 reward.

640
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,906
- That's a big story.
- Ask the marshal.

641
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:56,785
Oh, she's a runaway, all right.
Bound to be paper on her.

642
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,955
They're in this story together.
I've got business across the river

643
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,124
and if you interfere with me
you may land up in court,

644
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:04,709
which you don't want to be.

645
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:07,337
I've got a good lawyer
in J. Noble Daggett.

646
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:17,013
- Lawyer Daggett again.
- She draws him like a gun.

647
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:31,069
I will not walk up that hill.

648
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,405
Well, I'm not about to let $50 slide.

649
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,823
Get on that horse, then.

650
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:42,872
Wait a minute.

651
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,375
I got to fix my hat.

652
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:53,174
Hey! Come back here!

653
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:58,156
By God! She reminds me of me.

654
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:00,533
Then we might just not get along.

655
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:53,419
Well, you were
a little slow getting across.

656
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,422
I said you wasn't going.
Go back.

657
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,174
I will do no such thing.

658
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:00,260
La Boeuf...

659
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:10,937
Right.

660
00:53:18,988 --> 00:53:21,447
Those horses can't get away
from Little Blackie.

661
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:23,950
They're loaded down
with fat men and iron.

662
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:12,999
Now we'll see what tune you sing.

663
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,091
I'm going to raise welts on you
like worms.

664
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,010
See what good it does you!

665
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:27,180
You're not hurting me! I'm just mad!

666
00:54:27,932 --> 00:54:31,684
- Are you going to let him do this?
- I don't believe I will.

667
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:33,519
Drop that switch, La Boeuf.

668
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,815
Put it down, I said.
You're enjoying it too much.

669
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:40,818
You'll find that
I go ahead with what I start.

670
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:46,407
You do, and it'll be the biggest mistake
you ever made, you Texas brushpopper.

671
00:54:47,576 --> 00:54:51,704
You've taken her part all along. But
you ain't doing her no kindness here.

672
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,373
Just leave her alone.

673
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:03,383
Listen, this has given me a plan.

674
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,927
When we locate Chaney,
we can jump him in the same way,

675
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:08,179
hit him on the head with sticks
and knock him insensible.

676
00:55:08,347 --> 00:55:11,140
Then we can tie his feet and
hands together and take him back alive.

677
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:12,308
What do you think?

678
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:15,103
I don't think you'd like to know
what I think.

679
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,729
Get on your horse.

680
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,941
It's not dinnertime by now?

681
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:23,111
Dinnertime will come
and go without notice on this trip.

682
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,821
Get on your horse.

683
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:15,788
Presbyterian, huh?

684
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:17,415
- Southern or Cumberland?
- Southern.

685
00:56:17,583 --> 00:56:19,876
My folks are Cumberland.
Proud of it, too.

686
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,545
I was raised
in an Episcopal church myself.

687
00:56:23,047 --> 00:56:24,797
Figured you for some kind of kneeler.

688
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,222
Well, what did you learn?

689
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:38,061
Well, Ned was sighted at McAlester's
store about three days ago.

690
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:42,523
He goes there from time to time
to pay attention to a lewd woman.

691
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:45,276
There's an old thief
named Hayes with him

692
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:47,779
and a Mexican on a round-bellied pony.

693
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,073
Our man Chaney wasn't seen,

694
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,160
but it's certain he was in
on that mail hijacking job.

695
00:56:54,328 --> 00:56:55,495
Stew?

696
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,355
This is worse than a pig trail.

697
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:26,275
- Shortest way to McAlester's.
- How far is it?

698
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:32,406
Around 60 miles. We'll make 15 today,
get an early start tomorrow.

699
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,535
How do you like this coon hunt, sister?

700
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:39,038
Don't be looking around for me,
I'll be right here.

701
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:46,879
You look like a hog on ice.

702
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,382
Bucket is heavy.

703
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,260
I'm stronger than I look.

704
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,263
What did you bring for us to eat?

705
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:56,514
Salt...

706
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:58,516
...red pepper...

707
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:00,643
...taffy.

708
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,147
Carry those in your pockets?

709
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:08,401
Yeah. Along with cartridges
and skinning knife.

710
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:12,989
- What are those things?
- Corn dodgers.

711
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,033
Goodness. How many you got in there?

712
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:19,036
Must be 175.

713
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,956
Can't scarcely credit that.

714
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:27,253
Yeah. Chen Lee must've thought
it was for a wagonload of marshals.

715
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:32,925
That tastes like iron.

716
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:35,136
You're lucky to be where
water's so handy.

717
00:58:36,096 --> 00:58:38,598
I've seen the time
I've drank out of a filthy hoof print,

718
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:40,266
and I was glad to get it.

719
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:45,479
If ever I meet one of you Texas waddies
who ain't drunk water from a hoof print,

720
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:51,319
I think I'll shake their hand
or buy them a Daniel Webster cigar.

721
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:54,947
How long you boys down there
been mounted on sheep?

722
00:58:57,075 --> 00:59:01,120
Go ahead and have your little joke,
but I'll tell you one thing,

723
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:02,705
that little fellow there
will still be running

724
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:06,292
when that big American stud of yours
is winded and collapsed.

725
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,627
Sheep.

726
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:16,844
Don't you think that fire's a little big
if we're going to pass unnoticed?

727
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:18,679
A small fire's ranger's policy.

728
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,806
Yeah.

729
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:24,393
- Of all the dumb things to do...
- Hey, listen. I have an idea.

730
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:27,813
How would you two like to hear
the story of the midnight caller?

731
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,523
Now, one of you'll have to
play the caller,

732
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:33,110
I'll tell you what to say
and I'll play all the other parts.

733
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,571
Fine. Go ahead and tell it.

734
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,533
I'll tell the story
if you stop drinking.

735
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:45,331
Let it go.
That, baby sister, is no trade.

736
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:19,198
Least Little Blackie
likes the corn dodgers.

737
01:00:19,366 --> 01:00:20,825
It's the salt in them.

738
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:33,796
We won't get to McAlester's by dark,
so we better head for a dugout I know.

739
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:37,717
It's empty, and we can shelter in it.
We can eat your turkey there.

740
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:42,722
- I don't see how. It's all ripped up.
- Yeah. Pretty chewed.

741
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:44,307
Too much gun.

742
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:04,720
I thought you said it'd be empty.

743
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,994
Who are you?
What do you want?

744
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:34,834
- We're looking for a place to sleep.
- Well, there's no room for you here.

745
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:52,685
Try that on the chimney.

746
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:55,456
I am a federal officer.
Speak up. Who's in there?

747
01:03:55,624 --> 01:03:58,459
None of your damn business.
Keep riding.

748
01:03:58,627 --> 01:04:02,463
- Is that Emmett Quincy?
- We don't know any Emmett Quincy!

749
01:04:02,631 --> 01:04:07,051
Emmett, this is Rooster.
I got five more marshals out here,

750
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:10,513
- and we got a bucket of coal oil.
- Drink it!

751
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:13,265
One more minute,
and you're going to drink it.

752
01:04:13,433 --> 01:04:16,268
Chuck your guns out,
follow them with your hands high,

753
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:20,356
and nobody'll get hurt!
If that coal oil goes down the chimney,

754
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:23,275
we're killing everybody
that comes out that door.

755
01:04:24,110 --> 01:04:26,362
There's no five marshals out there.

756
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:31,075
Well, now, don't you
bet your life on it.

757
01:04:31,243 --> 01:04:34,995
- Moon can't walk. He's hit.
- Well, drag him out.

758
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,830
What kind of papers you got on me?

759
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:39,917
Got no papers on you.
You better move.

760
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:42,253
Tell those others
to be careful with their guns.

761
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,963
We're coming out.

762
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:52,471
Hit the dirt. Belly down.

763
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:54,139
Spread-eagle.

764
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:09,655
I forgot they was there.

765
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:13,826
Get inside. Both of you.

766
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,088
Wrap that around your leg.

767
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:31,343
Put the horses in the lean-to.

768
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:39,643
Cuff them.

769
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,061
Get up.

770
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:47,610
Sit down.
Get down there!

771
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,529
You fellows are way too jumpy.

772
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:53,782
What have you been up to,
besides stealing stock?

773
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,367
You said you ain't got no papers on us.

774
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:58,829
Well, not by name,
but I got a few John Does.

775
01:05:58,997 --> 01:06:01,915
Resisting a federal officer.
That's a year right there.

776
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,753
- But my leg hurts.
- I'll bet it do, sonny boy.

777
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,173
Now you just sit right still
so it won't bleed so bad.

778
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,884
When's the last time
you saw Ned Pepper?

779
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:14,136
I don't remember any Ned Pepper.

780
01:06:14,304 --> 01:06:17,890
Short, feisty fellow. Nervous and quick.
Got a messed-up lower lip.

781
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:19,600
That don't bring nobody to mind.

782
01:06:19,768 --> 01:06:22,353
- A funny lip?
- Wasn't always like that.

783
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,813
- I shot him in it.
- In the lower lip?

784
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,691
- What was you aiming at?
- His upper lip.

785
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:31,862
Ned's got a new boy running with him
with a black powder mark on his face.

786
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:34,406
That don't bring nobody to mind either.

787
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:37,826
You don't know
anything I want to know, do you?

788
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,829
- If I did know, I wouldn't blow.
- How about you?

789
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:44,583
I always like to help the law
as long as it don't harm my friends.

790
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,378
Pretty good idea,

791
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:51,048
'cause otherwise I'll turn you in
back at Fort Smith.

792
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:55,719
By that time, that leg of yours will be
swelled up tighter than Dick's hatband.

793
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:57,805
Mortify, and they'll have to cut it off.

794
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:00,349
And then if you live,
I'll get you three or four years

795
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:04,061
- in a federal penitentiary.
- You're trying to get at me.

796
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:08,774
Of course, if you talk,
I'll take you to McAlester's.

797
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:13,237
They'll get that ball out of your leg,
and I'll give you two, three days

798
01:07:13,405 --> 01:07:15,614
to get out of the territory.

799
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,783
Don't go flapping your mouth, Moon.
I'll do the talking.

800
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:22,454
Yeah. You listen to Quincy, Moon,
and you'll lose your leg or your life.

801
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:24,123
Quincy ain't hurting.

802
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:27,459
Don't let him spook you!
Ain't got nothing on us.

803
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:34,091
Been looking around outside.
Six horses in the stock shelter.

804
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:35,509
What kind of horses?

805
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:37,970
Right good mounts to me.
They're all shod.

806
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:41,640
- These men are waiting for somebody.
- You don't say.

807
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:46,645
If you won't talk, you can keep busy.
Cut that up for frying.

808
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,662
What are you looking at?
Who are you?

809
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:07,207
I'm Mattie Ross
of near Dardanelle in Yell County.

810
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,501
What the hell's she doing here?
I don't understand it!

811
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,670
She's after the man
that killed her father.

812
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:15,215
His name is Tom Chaney.
He's a whiskey drinker like you.

813
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:17,009
Led to killing in the end.

814
01:08:17,177 --> 01:08:19,511
Now, if you'll just answer the
marshal's questions, he'll help you.

815
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:21,638
I have a good lawyer at home.
He'll help you, too.

816
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:23,682
Don't get to jawing
with these people, Moon.

817
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:26,310
- We'll get clear of this.
- I don't like the way you look.

818
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:29,730
- You talking to me, runt?
- Yes. I don't like the way you look.

819
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:32,107
And I don't like the way
you're cutting up that turkey!

820
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:34,693
Rooster, this Quincy's making a mess
of that turkey.

821
01:08:34,861 --> 01:08:37,780
Do the job right, Quincy,
or I'll have you eating them feathers.

822
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,741
I hope you go to jail.
My lawyer will not help you.

823
01:08:40,909 --> 01:08:43,869
It's a shame,
a kid like Moon losing his leg.

824
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:47,331
Too young to be hopping around
on a log peg.

825
01:08:47,499 --> 01:08:50,793
Loves to dance too much,
and sports.

826
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,546
- You're trying to get at me again.
- I'm getting at you with the truth.

827
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:57,049
We seen Ned and Ace
two days ago at McAlester's.

828
01:08:57,217 --> 01:08:58,467
You blow, and I'll kill you!

829
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:02,888
I'm played out, Quincy. I got
to have a doctor! I'll tell what I know.

830
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:13,190
Oh, Lord! Oh, God!
I'm dying. Help me, I'm dying.

831
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:15,943
I can't do a thing for you, son.

832
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:19,196
Your partner's killed you,
and I've done for him.

833
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:22,491
Don't leave me laying here.
Don't let those wolves get me.

834
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:25,911
I'll see you get buried.
Where's Ned Pepper?

835
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:29,706
They're going to rob the Katy Flyer.

836
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:33,544
They're coming here tonight
for remounts. They wanted four horses.

837
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:36,547
Did you see a fellow with them
with a powder burn on his face?

838
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:37,840
No.

839
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:41,718
My brother... George Garrett,

840
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:44,972
Methodist circuit rider
out of Austin, Texas.

841
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:46,932
When's Pepper due here?

842
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:53,647
Sell my traps, Rooster.
Send that money to my brother.

843
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:56,108
Do you want us to tell your brother
what happened to you?

844
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:58,318
It doesn't matter. He knows.

845
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:04,074
I'll meet him later,
walking the streets of glory.

846
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:07,995
- Don't expect to see Quincy there.
- Quincy?

847
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:13,083
He never played me false
until he killed me.

848
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:16,420
Let me have a cool drink of water.

849
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:31,143
Look. I still have fingers there.

850
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:55,500
Let me have that.

851
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:58,837
- It's one of Papa's gold pieces.
- Are you sure?

852
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:03,926
Yes. It was minted in California.
It says so. Worth a little over $36.

853
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,511
Grandpa Sperling gave Papa
two of these when he married Mama.

854
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,597
Looks like we're on Chaney's trail.

855
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:13,602
At least we're on Ned's.
Give me the key to these cuffs.

856
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:16,521
Now, go saddle the horses.

857
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:19,691
Well, Moon said they were coming here.
You aim to run?

858
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:24,529
I aim to do what I come here to do.
Saddle the horses.

859
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:30,953
Straighten up the place.

860
01:12:07,699 --> 01:12:10,951
You take your horse
and find a position over there.

861
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:14,079
I'll be up on this side
and don't shoot unless I do.

862
01:12:14,247 --> 01:12:16,456
Now, what we want to do
is get them in that dugout.

863
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:20,085
I'll shoot the last man through the door
and we'll have them over a barrel.

864
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:21,920
You'd shoot them without a call?

865
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:24,923
That'll get him
to know our intentions is serious.

866
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,802
Well, I'll holler down after I shoot.

867
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,054
See if any of them
want to be taken alive.

868
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:33,640
When they won't, we'll shoot them
as they come out the door.

869
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:36,768
- I want Chaney alive.
- And so does the Governor of Texas.

870
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:40,605
All I know is there's a lot of them
and only two of us.

871
01:12:40,773 --> 01:12:43,650
Why don't I try to nick Chaney
before he gets inside?

872
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:45,944
Any shooting
before they get in that dugout,

873
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:47,154
and they'll break.

874
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:49,781
We're apt to come up
with an empty sack.

875
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:52,951
All right.
But if they break, I'll nick Chaney.

876
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:54,995
You hit Chaney
with that Sharps rifle of yours,

877
01:12:55,163 --> 01:12:56,246
you're apt to kill him.

878
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:58,623
- Yes. Remember the turkey?
- Yeah.

879
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:02,753
You go after Ned.
I'll take care of Chaney.

880
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,504
What does Ned look like?

881
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:07,549
He's a short, feisty fellow.
Do most of the talking.

882
01:13:07,717 --> 01:13:10,135
- Where does she go?
- I go where Rooster goes.

883
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:18,745
- You stay here. Keep the horses quiet.
- Can't see anything from over there.

884
01:14:18,913 --> 01:14:21,206
Haven't you seen
enough killings for one day?

885
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:24,793
I'm not staying here by myself.
Wait a minute. I'll get my revolver.

886
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:28,713
What for?
So you can shoot your own foot off?

887
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,042
Why do you keep
that one chamber empty?

888
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,211
So I won't shoot my foot off.

889
01:15:11,048 --> 01:15:12,382
Corn dodger?

890
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,344
Light a match and let me see it first.

891
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:20,098
- What for?
- Some of them got blood on them.

892
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,684
Well, we ain't lighting no matches.

893
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:25,312
Well, I don't want any.

894
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,903
What did you do before you
became a peace officer?

895
01:15:33,070 --> 01:15:34,529
Just about everything...

896
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:36,531
...except keep school.

897
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:38,450
How'd you lose your eye?

898
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:40,785
It was in the war.

899
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:44,539
The Lone Jack.
Little scrap outside of Kansas City.

900
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:46,499
What did you do after the war?

901
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:50,629
I robbed me a federal paymaster
and went to Cairo, Illinois,

902
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:53,506
and bought a eating place there
called the Green Frog

903
01:15:53,674 --> 01:15:55,425
and married a grass widow.

904
01:15:56,969 --> 01:16:01,306
- Place had a billiard table.
- You never told me you had a wife.

905
01:16:01,474 --> 01:16:03,725
Oh, well, I didn't have her long.

906
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:08,313
My friends was a pack of river rats.
She didn't crave their society,

907
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:12,984
so she upped and left me
and went back to her first husband

908
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:16,363
who was clerking
in a hardware store in Paducah.

909
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,532
"Goodbye, Reuben," she says,

910
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,619
"the love of decency
does not abide in you".

911
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:28,500
That's a divorced woman talking for you,
about decency.

912
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:32,879
Well, I told her,
I said, "Goodbye, Nola,

913
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:36,633
and I hope that nail-selling bastard
makes you happy this time".

914
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:40,470
Did you have any children?

915
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:45,558
There was a boy.
Nola taken him with her.

916
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:49,437
He never liked me anyway.

917
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:56,820
A clumsier child you'll never see
than Horace. I bet he broke 40 cup.

918
01:16:58,698 --> 01:17:01,032
Never did get you
for stealing that money.

919
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:04,327
Why, I didn't consider it stealing.

920
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:07,706
- It didn't belong to you.
- I needed a road stake.

921
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,625
It was like that little high-interest
bank in New Mexico.

922
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:12,919
Needed a road stake, and there it was.

923
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:16,589
I never robbed no citizen
or taken a man's watch.

924
01:17:16,757 --> 01:17:18,383
It's all stealing.

925
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:24,097
That's the position them New Mexicans
took. I had to flee for my life.

926
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:28,059
Bo was a young colt then.
No horse could run him into the ground.

927
01:17:29,562 --> 01:17:34,649
When that posse thinned out,
I turned old Bo around,

928
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:38,486
and taking them reins in my teeth,
I charged them boys

929
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:40,822
firing two navy sixes.

930
01:17:42,116 --> 01:17:45,994
They must've all been married men
that loved their families

931
01:17:46,162 --> 01:17:48,830
'cause they scattered and run for home.

932
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:54,794
You don't have any family, do you?
Except Chen Lee and that lazy cat.

933
01:17:54,962 --> 01:18:00,258
General Price don't belong to me.
Cats don't belong to nobody.

934
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:03,636
He just rooms with me.
'Course, I depend on him.

935
01:18:05,765 --> 01:18:10,977
Well, baby sister,
you better try and get some sleep.

936
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:14,314
I'll wake you up when they get here.

937
01:18:49,141 --> 01:18:52,310
Looks like Moon was telling the truth.

938
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:43,570
- What are they doing?
- They're smelling around.

939
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:45,405
You see Chaney?

940
01:19:48,742 --> 01:19:50,535
Can't make out their faces.

941
01:19:51,537 --> 01:19:53,746
Well, that's Ned Pepper, all right.

942
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:26,779
Quincy!

943
01:20:27,907 --> 01:20:28,990
Moon!

944
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:31,576
- That's him hollering.
- Moon!

945
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:35,205
That's the original
Mexican Bob with him.

946
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,874
You mean there's more than one?

947
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:42,337
Yeah. There's a younger one,
but he ain't a patch to this one.

948
01:20:42,505 --> 01:20:43,713
Moon!

949
01:20:45,299 --> 01:20:46,633
Quincy!

950
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:56,601
Now he done it!

951
01:21:36,225 --> 01:21:37,809
Over here, Ned!

952
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:42,438
I'm hit!

953
01:21:56,787 --> 01:21:59,497
They don't call him
"Lucky" Ned Pepper for nothing.

954
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:02,500
That man gave his life for him.
He didn't even look back.

955
01:22:02,668 --> 01:22:06,004
Yeah. Looking back is a bad habit.

956
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:09,007
Well...

957
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,604
Well, what's your story?

958
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,314
I was on the move to a better place.

959
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:27,233
I heard the first shot,
and I thought you'd opened up.

960
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:28,901
More likely asleep.

961
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:32,530
You know who they are?

962
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:35,950
The one on the sand spit is old Hayes.

963
01:22:42,833 --> 01:22:43,833
The boy...

964
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:46,210
...I don't know.

965
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:49,631
He's not much older than I am.

966
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:56,554
That's nothing but a little scratch.

967
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:01,643
Well, that's nothing to do with you.

968
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,436
Why don't you go make us some coffee?

969
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:04,896
It won't take long.

970
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:10,068
- Let it go and go on inside.
- Why are you being so foolish?

971
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,580
Well, La Boeuf,
you're quite a horse shooter.

972
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:24,415
I was trying for Ned Pepper.

973
01:23:24,583 --> 01:23:27,585
Well, next time, try for the horse
and maybe you'll hit Pepper.

974
01:23:27,753 --> 01:23:28,753
What are we waiting for?

975
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:31,506
- I say we ride after them.
- And I say no.

976
01:23:31,674 --> 01:23:33,424
I know where they're going to earth.

977
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:35,843
You can't take men
by watching them run away.

978
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:40,139
Back up. I know this country,
and I know these men.

979
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:43,518
We'll take the horses
and the dead in to McAlester.

980
01:23:43,686 --> 01:23:48,064
And I'll put in a claim for any reward
the railroad may have offered.

981
01:23:48,232 --> 01:23:52,068
- You backed up?
- Some, for now.

982
01:24:12,715 --> 01:24:14,173
Damn a man that whistles.

983
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:17,218
Maybe he's trying to keep
his mind off of his hand.

984
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:20,096
You don't think very much of me,
do you, Cogs?

985
01:24:20,264 --> 01:24:23,725
Don't think about you at all.
You keep your mouth closed.

986
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:25,268
I was told in Fort Smith

987
01:24:25,436 --> 01:24:28,271
that you rode with Quantrill
and that border trash.

988
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:32,442
And I heard Quantrill and his men
weren't soldiers at all

989
01:24:32,609 --> 01:24:36,237
- but a bunch of murdering thieves.
- I heard the same thing.

990
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:39,741
I heard they murdered women
and children in the Lawrence raid.

991
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:42,535
I heard that, too, and it's a damn lie.

992
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:45,580
What outfit were you
with during the war?

993
01:24:45,748 --> 01:24:49,709
- Freeport, with Kirby Smith.
- I mean, what side were you on?

994
01:24:50,419 --> 01:24:52,545
I served with General Kirby Smith.

995
01:24:53,505 --> 01:24:55,798
I don't have to
hang my head when I say it, either.

996
01:24:55,966 --> 01:24:57,467
Go ahead and make
another joke about it.

997
01:24:57,634 --> 01:24:59,844
You want to make me
look foolish in the girl's eyes, anyway.

998
01:25:00,012 --> 01:25:01,804
You don't need me for that.

999
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:04,891
I don't like the way
you make conversation.

1000
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:08,770
And I don't like your conversation
about Captain Quantrill.

1001
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:12,899
Captain? Captain of what?
A bunch of thieves?

1002
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:17,779
Young fellow, if you're looking
for trouble, I'll accommodate you.

1003
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,448
Otherwise, leave it alone.

1004
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:22,867
You know, I've been thinking about
Lucky Ned Pepper.

1005
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:25,203
Maybe he planned on murdering
those two stock thieves

1006
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:26,704
so they wouldn't inform against him.

1007
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:29,373
- No. Ned wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

1008
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:32,919
Ned doesn't go
around killing people for no reason.

1009
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:35,087
Had he a reason, he'd kill them.

1010
01:25:47,893 --> 01:25:50,561
It looks like we might joggle
some of our passengers off.

1011
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:54,232
Well, they're past hurting.

1012
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:17,380
We'll tie up here, if you don't mind.

1013
01:26:17,548 --> 01:26:20,591
Sure, Marshal.
You got quite a load there.

1014
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:24,887
Yeah, about half the load
I was looking for.

1015
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:27,014
Why don't you go in
and meet Mrs. McAlester?

1016
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,683
She'll fix you some dinner.

1017
01:26:28,851 --> 01:26:30,434
I want to have a word
with the peace officer.

1018
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:31,769
I want to go, too.

1019
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:34,772
I'll tell the wife
to fix something for all of you.

1020
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:37,942
Well, why don't you go inside?

1021
01:26:38,110 --> 01:26:41,988
Maybe Mrs. McAlester
can fix that poor little hand of yours.

1022
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:43,948
My poor little hand can keep.

1023
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:11,142
- Rooster, what are you doing here?
- Boots, Gaspargo.

1024
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:14,145
How come you're letting that Indian
get behind you with a cutting tool?

1025
01:27:14,313 --> 01:27:15,354
'Cause I'm an Indian.

1026
01:27:15,522 --> 01:27:18,649
I've seen plenty of Indian scalps
on Indian belts.

1027
01:27:19,902 --> 01:27:22,987
If you're after little Ned Pepper,
you're on a cold trail here.

1028
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:24,655
We're looking for another man, too.

1029
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:27,950
He's got a black mark on his face,
carries a Henry rifle.

1030
01:27:28,118 --> 01:27:29,744
We think maybe he's running with Ned.

1031
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:32,997
Go ahead.
That's what Texas calls a peace officer.

1032
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:35,416
Well, Ned passed through here
a couple of days ago.

1033
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:38,878
Him and Hayes, Mexican Bob.
Only them three was seen.

1034
01:27:39,046 --> 01:27:41,005
I have a pretty good idea
where Ned's holed up.

1035
01:27:41,173 --> 01:27:44,175
If he is where I think he is, it will
take 100 marshals to smoke him out.

1036
01:27:44,343 --> 01:27:46,886
My name's Mattie Ross
from near Dardanelle in Yell County.

1037
01:27:47,054 --> 01:27:49,931
That man with the black mark
on his face, he killed my father.

1038
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,390
His name's Tom Chaney.

1039
01:27:51,558 --> 01:27:54,518
Boots, I got Hayes
and some youngster outside

1040
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:57,688
with Moon and Quincy.
I want you to bury them for me.

1041
01:27:57,856 --> 01:28:00,191
- I'm in a hurry.
- They're dead?

1042
01:28:01,026 --> 01:28:03,694
Well, I wouldn't want you to bury them
if they wasn't.

1043
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:07,198
What about La Boeuf's hand?

1044
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:10,368
Gaspargo's a pretty good doctor
when he ain't currying hair.

1045
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:12,912
- Take care of it.
- It can wait.

1046
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:14,747
You're of no good use
when you're handicapped.

1047
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:17,208
And small use if he ain't.

1048
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:22,380
- Wash first.
- Why?

1049
01:28:22,547 --> 01:28:26,050
- Don't you wash before you eat?
- I'm not going to eat his hand.

1050
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:28,219
- Don't you know about germs?
- No.

1051
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:31,806
Go wash, Gaspargo. You lost.

1052
01:28:44,695 --> 01:28:45,820
That's Moon.

1053
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:53,077
Quincy.

1054
01:28:57,374 --> 01:28:58,374
Hayes.

1055
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:00,543
First time he ever stayed shot.

1056
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:07,758
I know this boy, Billy Walsh.

1057
01:29:07,926 --> 01:29:10,094
He comes from a good family
down by the south Canadian.

1058
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:13,764
Well, then hold good boy Billy
for his folks

1059
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:16,100
and bury the rest of them.
I'll post their names.

1060
01:29:16,268 --> 01:29:18,686
If anybody wants them,
they can come dig them up.

1061
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:23,399
Sell the horses and get what you
can for their coats, guns, and saddles.

1062
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:24,567
I'll split it with you.

1063
01:29:24,735 --> 01:29:27,028
You told Moon
whatever his traps would fetch,

1064
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:28,195
you'd send it to his brother.

1065
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:29,739
I forget where he said to send it.

1066
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:31,449
His brother's a preacher
named George Garrett.

1067
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:33,951
He can be reached at the
Methodist Church in Austin, Texas.

1068
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:37,413
Are you sure it was Austin?
Or was it Dallas?

1069
01:29:37,581 --> 01:29:39,206
You know it was Austin.

1070
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,418
Write it out and give it to Captain.

1071
01:29:42,586 --> 01:29:44,420
Boots, send this man $10,

1072
01:29:44,588 --> 01:29:47,048
and tell him his brother got caught
and is buried here.

1073
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:48,466
I'll do that.

1074
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:51,302
So this is the man who shot
Ned Pepper's horse from under him.

1075
01:29:51,470 --> 01:29:55,556
Yeah, this is the famous horse killer
from El Paso.

1076
01:29:55,724 --> 01:30:00,061
He believes in putting everybody afoot.
Says there'll be less mischief that way.

1077
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:02,354
Fewer horses, fewer horse thieves.

1078
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:04,023
How's your hand feel?

1079
01:30:04,649 --> 01:30:06,817
Both rifle and hand
are ready to shoot again.

1080
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:09,612
Straighter than before, I hope.

1081
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:14,575
Well, sister, the time has come
for me to ride hard and fast.

1082
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:16,535
You stay here with the McAlesters.

1083
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:18,788
I'll be back in two or three days
with Tom Chaney.

1084
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:20,664
You can't get shed of me.

1085
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:23,292
- Well, she's come this far.
- That's far enough.

1086
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,419
You think I'm gonna quit
when we're so close?

1087
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:27,254
There's something
in what she's saying, Cogburn.

1088
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:29,799
She's won her spurs.
I think she's done just fine.

1089
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:34,011
Let it go. I've said my piece.
There'll be no more talk about

1090
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:36,764
- who won whose spurs.
- I'm going.

1091
01:30:36,932 --> 01:30:40,226
Not because you say I can't,
and not because you say I can.

1092
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:43,771
I paid good cash money to be here
and I'm on my own business.

1093
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:45,815
Now, we'll have no more talk about it.

1094
01:30:47,818 --> 01:30:48,859
Let's eat.

1095
01:31:31,736 --> 01:31:32,736
What are you doing?

1096
01:31:34,614 --> 01:31:36,031
Looking for a sign.

1097
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:39,243
You couldn't see it if you saw it.

1098
01:31:41,246 --> 01:31:42,913
We'll walk a ways.

1099
01:32:19,951 --> 01:32:21,535
You looking for sign again?

1100
01:32:23,997 --> 01:32:25,122
It was Bo.

1101
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:29,752
He put his foot wrong.
He's tired.

1102
01:32:33,131 --> 01:32:34,506
This is no grade.

1103
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:39,970
I've freighted iron stoves
up harder grades than this.

1104
01:32:50,023 --> 01:32:51,815
We'll camp here.

1105
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:01,325
Here.

1106
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:12,419
I was a pretty fair hand
with a jerkline

1107
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:15,839
when I was freighting in Colorado.

1108
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:22,680
Worked for a fellow
that was always down with something.

1109
01:33:26,685 --> 01:33:29,687
He was carrying around
a 21-foot tapeworm,

1110
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:32,690
along with his business
responsibilities.

1111
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:34,191
That aged him.

1112
01:33:35,277 --> 01:33:37,569
Then his wife
commenced running things.

1113
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:42,574
I wasn't about to work for her.
So I told her so.

1114
01:33:45,036 --> 01:33:47,579
Women have no generosity.

1115
01:33:48,707 --> 01:33:51,709
Lord God, how they hate to pay up.

1116
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:58,882
A man will never work for a woman,
unless he's got clabber for brains.

1117
01:33:59,342 --> 01:34:01,719
What about the $25 I paid you?

1118
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:05,639
What $25?

1119
01:34:06,558 --> 01:34:08,559
I will not bandy words with a drunkard.

1120
01:34:09,936 --> 01:34:13,897
And that's real smart. You've done
nothing when you've bested a fool.

1121
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:20,738
We have come near about
50 miles from McAlester.

1122
01:34:21,614 --> 01:34:26,368
We're close to Ned Pepper's camp.
Tomorrow we'll take him.

1123
01:35:05,992 --> 01:35:07,368
If we're as close
to Ned Pepper as you say,

1124
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:09,870
I don't think too much
of making that fire.

1125
01:35:10,038 --> 01:35:11,580
Nobody asked you.

1126
01:35:12,999 --> 01:35:14,917
Where are you going with that canteen?

1127
01:35:15,085 --> 01:35:17,002
To wash the sleep off of me, of course.

1128
01:35:17,170 --> 01:35:18,962
We got no water to spare
for foolishness.

1129
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:20,547
Take a drink and let it go at that.

1130
01:35:21,800 --> 01:35:24,051
I'd say there's
a stream down below there.

1131
01:35:28,848 --> 01:35:31,558
You'll wash
and you'll get no breakfast!

1132
01:35:31,726 --> 01:35:33,519
We'll waste no more time!

1133
01:35:34,562 --> 01:35:38,232
Shouldn't one of us go down with her?
Might not be safe.

1134
01:35:39,192 --> 01:35:43,904
Well, safer for her than whatever
she meets, man or beast.

1135
01:36:47,719 --> 01:36:48,719
Well...

1136
01:36:49,262 --> 01:36:52,139
I know you, little Mattie,
the bookkeeper.

1137
01:36:53,308 --> 01:36:56,977
- And I know you, Tom Chaney.
- What are you doing?

1138
01:36:57,145 --> 01:36:59,980
There's no money for you
to squeeze around here.

1139
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:04,651
- I came to fetch water.
- That was not my meaning.

1140
01:37:11,075 --> 01:37:13,952
I'm here to take you back to Fort Smith
and hang you.

1141
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:17,247
And I think I will not go.
Now, how do you like that?

1142
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:22,169
There's a posse of officers up the hill
that'll force you to go.

1143
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:23,545
How many officers?

1144
01:37:23,713 --> 01:37:27,549
I'd say right around 50,
and they mean business.

1145
01:37:27,717 --> 01:37:30,469
So you just walk
right in front of me, up that hill.

1146
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:34,097
I think I'll oblige those officers
to come after me.

1147
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:38,310
If you refuse to go with me,
I'll have to shoot you.

1148
01:37:38,937 --> 01:37:40,103
Is that so?

1149
01:37:41,231 --> 01:37:43,106
You better cock your piece.

1150
01:37:46,152 --> 01:37:47,778
All the way back until it locks.

1151
01:37:50,406 --> 01:37:51,907
I know how to do it.

1152
01:37:53,243 --> 01:37:54,952
Now, you mean to say that
you won't go with me

1153
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:56,495
on your own free will?

1154
01:37:57,914 --> 01:38:00,958
You just got it the other way around.
Now you will follow me.

1155
01:38:11,636 --> 01:38:13,053
I didn't think you'd do it.

1156
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:16,974
Sis! Where are you?

1157
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:19,726
I'm down here! I got Chaney!

1158
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:22,312
I just didn't think you'd do it.

1159
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:26,692
One of my short ribs is broke.

1160
01:38:26,859 --> 01:38:30,779
You killed my father
when he was trying to help you.

1161
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:33,115
You're just a piece of trash!

1162
01:38:33,283 --> 01:38:37,661
You also killed a senator in Texas
when he was sitting on a porch swing.

1163
01:38:38,413 --> 01:38:41,707
Everything happens to me.
Now I'm shot by a child!

1164
01:38:42,083 --> 01:38:43,875
I'll shoot you again
if you don't get up!

1165
01:38:44,919 --> 01:38:47,421
My father took you in
when you were hungry.

1166
01:39:02,020 --> 01:39:03,854
You little busybody!

1167
01:39:04,022 --> 01:39:05,689
I'll teach you a lesson
you'll never forget!

1168
01:39:05,857 --> 01:39:08,108
Sis! Sis!

1169
01:39:08,693 --> 01:39:10,527
Hurry up! Down here!

1170
01:39:17,201 --> 01:39:18,577
Take her and go!

1171
01:39:38,056 --> 01:39:39,723
Up the hill with the horses,
and don't stop.

1172
01:39:41,476 --> 01:39:43,393
Who all's out there?

1173
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:45,771
Marshal Rooster Cogburn
and 50 other officers.

1174
01:39:45,938 --> 01:39:47,189
They're all armed
and they mean business.

1175
01:39:47,357 --> 01:39:49,900
Tell me another lie,
I'll stove in your head.

1176
01:39:53,738 --> 01:39:55,280
The truth! Who's out there?

1177
01:39:56,407 --> 01:39:59,201
Marshal Rooster Cogburn
and a Texas Ranger.

1178
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:09,002
Rooster!
Rooster, can you hear me?

1179
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:11,713
You better answer, Rooster,
or I'll kill this girl!

1180
01:40:13,174 --> 01:40:16,259
You know I'll do it!
You want me to kill her?

1181
01:40:17,762 --> 01:40:20,305
You do what you think is best, Ned.

1182
01:40:20,473 --> 01:40:21,765
What are you...

1183
01:40:25,687 --> 01:40:28,730
She's nothing to me.
Nothing but a runaway.

1184
01:40:28,898 --> 01:40:31,983
You and that ranger
get moving double fast!

1185
01:40:32,151 --> 01:40:36,530
If I see you riding over that bald ridge
to the north, I'll spare the girl!

1186
01:40:36,698 --> 01:40:38,281
You got five minutes!

1187
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,451
We'll need more than five minutes, Ned.

1188
01:40:41,619 --> 01:40:43,370
I won't give you any more.

1189
01:40:45,331 --> 01:40:49,459
There'll be a party of marshals
coming through here pretty soon.

1190
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:53,922
You give me Tom Chaney
and I'll mislead them for six hours.

1191
01:40:54,966 --> 01:40:57,801
You can throw in
that spitfire of a girl, too.

1192
01:40:58,177 --> 01:41:00,053
Too thin, Rooster, too thin.

1193
01:41:00,638 --> 01:41:02,013
I won't trust you.

1194
01:41:03,015 --> 01:41:06,643
Your five minutes is running!
You better move!

1195
01:41:06,811 --> 01:41:10,397
All right, we're moving,
but we'll need more than five minutes.

1196
01:41:15,361 --> 01:41:18,321
I never busted a cap on a woman
or nobody much under 16,

1197
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:21,658
but it's enough that you know
I'll do what I have to do.

1198
01:41:21,826 --> 01:41:24,119
I'm Mattie Ross
of Dardanelle in Yell County.

1199
01:41:24,287 --> 01:41:25,495
My family has property,

1200
01:41:25,663 --> 01:41:27,998
and I don't know
why I'm being treated like this.

1201
01:41:28,499 --> 01:41:32,335
Well, it's enough that you know
I'll do what I have to do.

1202
01:41:37,884 --> 01:41:41,511
I saw you shot at the dugout.
Where are your wounds?

1203
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:44,222
My wounds
heal by themselves from inside.

1204
01:41:47,393 --> 01:41:49,728
Bob, you and Harold stay here,
keep a watch out below.

1205
01:41:51,689 --> 01:41:54,941
Keep this turkey cock quiet,
or we'll have him for supper.

1206
01:41:57,278 --> 01:41:58,820
Why don't you shut up?

1207
01:42:04,494 --> 01:42:06,036
Is that man simpleminded?

1208
01:42:06,204 --> 01:42:08,872
All the Parmalees is touched,
but Harold's the worst.

1209
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:11,833
No, their Ma's the worst,
then comes Harold's brother Farrell.

1210
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:13,710
But they're all good shots.

1211
01:42:37,944 --> 01:42:38,985
Get there!

1212
01:42:40,238 --> 01:42:42,072
I'll wring your scrawny neck!

1213
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,240
No, you won't.

1214
01:42:43,407 --> 01:42:45,242
Now, let that doctor
and go get those horses saddled.

1215
01:42:45,409 --> 01:42:48,620
Farrell, lend him a hand.
You set there and be still.

1216
01:43:02,134 --> 01:43:04,094
Your five minutes is up.
They better show.

1217
01:43:04,262 --> 01:43:06,012
Now what are you doing here?

1218
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:08,932
Tom Chaney shot my father to death
in Fort Smith.

1219
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:11,434
I was told
that Rooster Cogburn has grit.

1220
01:43:11,602 --> 01:43:14,980
I hired him to go after the murderer.
I found him myself and I shot him.

1221
01:43:15,147 --> 01:43:17,440
If I'd killed him,
I would not be in this fix.

1222
01:43:17,859 --> 01:43:21,486
- My revolver misfired.
- They will do it.

1223
01:43:21,654 --> 01:43:24,865
Most girls like little play-prettys,
but you like guns, don't you?

1224
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:27,492
If I did, I'd have one that worked.

1225
01:43:28,828 --> 01:43:30,954
I'll give him a little more time.

1226
01:43:32,331 --> 01:43:34,457
Was that Rooster and the Ranger
waylaid us last night?

1227
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:35,667
Yes.

1228
01:43:36,335 --> 01:43:37,794
Did they take Quincy and Moon?

1229
01:43:38,963 --> 01:43:42,591
They're both dead.
It was a terrible thing to see.

1230
01:43:42,758 --> 01:43:46,136
- Do you need a good lawyer?
- I need a good judge.

1231
01:43:47,346 --> 01:43:51,850
That man called Hayes, he's dead, too,
and the boy that saved your life.

1232
01:43:52,018 --> 01:43:53,393
I'm happy he done what he done,

1233
01:43:53,561 --> 01:43:56,229
but he should've kept his head
and looked out for himself.

1234
01:43:57,273 --> 01:43:58,815
Goes for your good friend Rooster.

1235
01:44:00,234 --> 01:44:01,484
Hey, Ned!

1236
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:47,030
Rooster Cogburn
is no good friend of mine.

1237
01:44:47,198 --> 01:44:51,618
He's a drunken, gabbing fool.
He led us right into your hands.

1238
01:44:51,786 --> 01:44:53,954
Now he's left me
with a gang of cutthroats.

1239
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:57,248
Is that what they call grit
in Fort Smith?

1240
01:44:57,416 --> 01:44:59,501
We call it something else
in Yell County.

1241
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:10,637
I was shot from ambush.
And it was one of them officers got me.

1242
01:45:10,805 --> 01:45:12,764
How can you tell a big story like that?

1243
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:16,142
We're five men and four horses,
one of us stays behind.

1244
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:18,019
That's you, Chaney. You lost the horse.

1245
01:45:18,187 --> 01:45:20,981
When we get out, I'll send somebody
back to fetch you with a fresh mount.

1246
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:23,650
What about me?
I'm not staying with Tom Chaney.

1247
01:45:23,818 --> 01:45:26,069
He won't harm you.
You understand that?

1248
01:45:26,237 --> 01:45:28,363
Rooster give us six hours
if we keep this girl safe.

1249
01:45:28,531 --> 01:45:32,283
If she don't stay safe,
you don't neither. You don't get paid.

1250
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:35,578
- Let me ride up with you, Farrell.
- No!

1251
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:37,914
- How about you, Bob?
- No.

1252
01:45:38,082 --> 01:45:39,124
Harold?

1253
01:45:40,543 --> 01:45:42,252
Do it again, Harold!

1254
01:45:50,469 --> 01:45:52,262
We'll see you tonight at Ma's.

1255
01:46:12,783 --> 01:46:14,117
What are you doing?

1256
01:46:14,285 --> 01:46:16,619
I'm getting some water
so I can wash my hands.

1257
01:46:16,787 --> 01:46:19,122
A little smut won't hurt you.

1258
01:46:19,290 --> 01:46:22,792
That's true, or else you and your
chums would surely be dead.

1259
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,294
Don't provoke me!

1260
01:46:25,171 --> 01:46:26,963
There's rattlesnakes down there
in that pit,

1261
01:46:27,131 --> 01:46:28,381
and I'm going to throw you in it!

1262
01:47:00,790 --> 01:47:04,501
Lucky Ned Pepper said
if you molest me, he will not pay you.

1263
01:47:04,668 --> 01:47:06,669
He is your boss,
you must do as he tells you.

1264
01:47:06,837 --> 01:47:10,048
He has no idea of paying me.
He left me here, knowing I'll be caught.

1265
01:47:11,675 --> 01:47:16,346
If you let me go now, I will keep silent
as to your whereabouts for two days.

1266
01:47:16,514 --> 01:47:20,016
I tell you I can do better than that.
I can shut you up forever!

1267
01:47:30,027 --> 01:47:32,862
All right, Chaney, that's enough!

1268
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:35,490
Put your hands up.

1269
01:47:45,918 --> 01:47:47,001
You get over there.

1270
01:47:47,169 --> 01:47:49,546
- Everything's against me!
- You hurt, Mattie?

1271
01:47:49,713 --> 01:47:51,840
I'm the one who's hurt.
It was this girl who done it!

1272
01:47:52,007 --> 01:47:53,007
Where's Rooster?

1273
01:47:53,175 --> 01:47:55,218
He's down below,
watching the front door.

1274
01:47:55,386 --> 01:47:56,553
He's found a place where we can watch.

1275
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:59,097
- Where's Little Blackie?
- Rooster's got him.

1276
01:48:00,766 --> 01:48:02,976
You get over there,
and you stay over there.

1277
01:48:07,356 --> 01:48:08,565
Watch out where you step.

1278
01:48:08,732 --> 01:48:10,984
He says there's deadly snakes
in that hole.

1279
01:48:50,649 --> 01:48:52,358
Where is the girl, Ned?

1280
01:48:52,902 --> 01:48:55,361
She was in wonderful health
when last I saw her.

1281
01:48:55,529 --> 01:48:57,113
I can't answer for her now.

1282
01:48:57,489 --> 01:48:59,866
You'll answer for her now.
Where is she?

1283
01:49:00,034 --> 01:49:02,869
Rooster! Make a run for it!

1284
01:49:03,037 --> 01:49:05,997
I got Mattie! Chaney, too!

1285
01:49:08,167 --> 01:49:09,959
Well, Rooster,
will you give us the road?

1286
01:49:10,127 --> 01:49:11,628
I have business elsewhere.

1287
01:49:13,005 --> 01:49:16,758
Farrell, you and
your brother stand clear.

1288
01:49:16,926 --> 01:49:21,137
I got no interest in you today.
Stand clear and you won't get hurt.

1289
01:49:24,642 --> 01:49:28,686
What's your intention?
You think one on four's a dogfall?

1290
01:49:30,606 --> 01:49:35,818
I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned,
or see you hanged in Fort Smith

1291
01:49:35,986 --> 01:49:39,364
at the Judge Parker's convenience.
Which will it be?

1292
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:42,533
I call that bold talk
for a one-eyed fat man.

1293
01:49:45,079 --> 01:49:48,206
Fill your hand, you son of a bitch!

1294
01:49:55,756 --> 01:49:56,756
Shoot them!

1295
01:49:56,924 --> 01:49:58,758
They're too far
and they're moving too fast.

1296
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:07,350
No grit?
Rooster Cogburn, not much.

1297
01:51:09,246 --> 01:51:10,371
Well, Rooster...

1298
01:51:12,416 --> 01:51:14,083
...I'm shot to pieces.

1299
01:51:21,884 --> 01:51:25,470
Hooray for the man from Texas!
Some bully shot.

1300
01:51:37,733 --> 01:51:38,941
Damn you, Bo.

1301
01:51:39,943 --> 01:51:43,613
First time you ever give me a reason
to cuss you.

1302
01:52:41,088 --> 01:52:42,588
Help me!

1303
01:52:43,757 --> 01:52:44,841
Please!

1304
01:52:45,801 --> 01:52:47,677
Help me! I'm in the pit!

1305
01:52:51,390 --> 01:52:53,933
There's a snake
down here and skeletons!

1306
01:52:54,101 --> 01:52:59,981
I warrant there'll be another one
before long, a little spindly one.

1307
01:53:00,274 --> 01:53:04,068
- How do you like it?
- Help me.

1308
01:53:06,947 --> 01:53:12,034
- Please help me!
- You say you don't like it?

1309
01:53:21,962 --> 01:53:23,379
Baby sister!

1310
01:53:35,809 --> 01:53:37,226
Are you down there, sis?

1311
01:53:37,394 --> 01:53:42,565
- Yes! Hurry! I'm in a bad way.
- All right. Hold on. Hold on.

1312
01:53:49,865 --> 01:53:51,532
I'm going to pitch you a rope.

1313
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:55,369
Now slip it under both arms
and tie a good knot.

1314
01:53:55,537 --> 01:53:59,040
I can't. I'm caught,
and my arm is broken.

1315
01:53:59,208 --> 01:54:00,958
There are snakes down here.

1316
01:54:20,437 --> 01:54:22,438
It's in here now!

1317
01:54:46,838 --> 01:54:48,381
Hang on right here.

1318
01:54:59,226 --> 01:55:01,686
Damn that Texan!
When you need him, he's dead!

1319
01:55:01,853 --> 01:55:04,564
I ain't dead yet, you bushwhacker.

1320
01:55:04,731 --> 01:55:05,815
Hang on.

1321
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:16,826
I want Papa's gun.

1322
01:55:23,709 --> 01:55:28,254
- I want the other gold piece, too.
- Are you sure you don't want the snake?

1323
01:55:28,422 --> 01:55:29,880
No, but I do want that other gold piece.

1324
01:55:30,048 --> 01:55:33,509
- Forget the gold piece.
- But it's mine, and I want it.

1325
01:56:33,028 --> 01:56:36,656
That Texican saved my neck twice.

1326
01:56:38,033 --> 01:56:39,659
Once after he was dead.

1327
01:56:42,579 --> 01:56:46,999
We're going to have to do something
about this snakebite in a hurry.

1328
01:57:37,926 --> 01:57:39,635
Let's get up.

1329
01:57:42,305 --> 01:57:44,306
Hold this arm up, little sister.

1330
01:58:03,869 --> 01:58:07,830
- We can't leave him like this.
- I'm the one that's leaving him.

1331
01:58:07,998 --> 01:58:11,500
If I don't get you a doctor,
you're going to be deader than he is.

1332
01:58:13,712 --> 01:58:18,841
- Little Blackie cannot carry us both.
- He'll have to. He's all I could catch.

1333
01:58:52,292 --> 01:58:55,920
Stop it!
We must stop! He's played out.

1334
01:59:01,718 --> 01:59:03,719
Stop it! You're killing him.

1335
02:00:16,918 --> 02:00:17,918
Hold it!

1336
02:00:18,712 --> 02:00:20,921
Wing them guns into that creek.

1337
02:00:23,300 --> 02:00:25,467
I'm borrowing this wagon off of you.

1338
02:01:15,894 --> 02:01:17,937
Boots! Finch!

1339
02:01:30,075 --> 02:01:34,036
Boots!

1340
02:02:14,285 --> 02:02:17,329
Am I addressing
Marshal Reuben J. Cogburn?

1341
02:02:17,497 --> 02:02:21,250
You're addressing him, Chen Lee,
and General Sterling Price.

1342
02:02:22,419 --> 02:02:27,965
Well, I'll not ask which is which
but I'll identify myself.

1343
02:02:29,259 --> 02:02:31,218
I am Lawyer J. Noble Daggett.

1344
02:02:33,471 --> 02:02:36,306
- I'll be damned.
- What?

1345
02:02:36,474 --> 02:02:37,599
Well, you're not...

1346
02:02:38,601 --> 02:02:41,103
...exactly what we expected.

1347
02:02:41,271 --> 02:02:42,271
You're a little...

1348
02:02:42,439 --> 02:02:45,649
- You're shrunk.
- I'll tell you frankly, sir,

1349
02:02:45,817 --> 02:02:50,070
I fully intended to have you jailed,
and I'm just the man who could do it,

1350
02:02:50,238 --> 02:02:52,740
but when Mattie told me
the straight of the matter,

1351
02:02:52,907 --> 02:02:54,158
I had second thoughts.

1352
02:02:54,325 --> 02:02:57,536
I still think you showed
very poor judgment in this affair,

1353
02:02:57,704 --> 02:03:00,539
but you're not
the scoundrel I took you for.

1354
02:03:00,707 --> 02:03:02,041
You have my thanks

1355
02:03:02,208 --> 02:03:05,377
and, with certain reservations,
my respect.

1356
02:03:05,545 --> 02:03:08,505
How nice.
Well, how is sis?

1357
02:03:09,924 --> 02:03:15,054
Gravely ill, I'm afraid
but still able to direct her affairs.

1358
02:03:16,056 --> 02:03:18,265
She commissioned me
to pay you the balance

1359
02:03:18,433 --> 02:03:21,560
of the $75 due
in the matter of Tom Chaney.

1360
02:03:23,646 --> 02:03:28,067
- She didn't ask for a receipt, did she?
- Well, as a matter of fact, she did.

1361
02:03:30,361 --> 02:03:35,991
You'll find that it also covers
an additional $200 for saving her life.

1362
02:03:36,910 --> 02:03:38,535
Well, I will be damned.

1363
02:03:39,913 --> 02:03:43,749
She says that when she goes home,
she wants you to take her there.

1364
02:03:45,085 --> 02:03:48,378
Poor child, I fear,
does not know how ill she really is.

1365
02:03:49,714 --> 02:03:53,926
Lawyer J. Noble Daggett,
are you a betting man?

1366
02:03:54,094 --> 02:03:55,177
On occasion.

1367
02:03:56,137 --> 02:03:59,181
All of this and General Price

1368
02:03:59,349 --> 02:04:01,975
that baby sister
makes it back to Yell County.

1369
02:04:05,855 --> 02:04:06,855
Oh, no.

1370
02:04:08,024 --> 02:04:09,483
No, sir. No, sir.

1371
02:04:22,789 --> 02:04:26,375
I still don't see why you didn't look up
La Boeuf's girl when you were in Waco.

1372
02:04:26,543 --> 02:04:29,211
Well, I did the best I could.

1373
02:04:29,379 --> 02:04:32,172
I took the boy home
to be buried in his Ranger suit.

1374
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:36,218
No girl showed up.
I don't believe there was one.

1375
02:04:36,386 --> 02:04:38,887
I think you were too busy collecting
a reward for Chaney.

1376
02:04:39,055 --> 02:04:41,306
Well, I was just a little busy.

1377
02:04:41,474 --> 02:04:44,810
Them Texicans forgot how much money
they offered for a reward.

1378
02:04:44,978 --> 02:04:48,188
- I had to help them remember.
- I can imagine how you did that.

1379
02:04:52,902 --> 02:04:54,987
This is what I wanted you to see.

1380
02:04:56,197 --> 02:04:58,490
Papa's marker
was not what was ordered.

1381
02:04:59,492 --> 02:05:02,744
I will make that wool-headed
fool of a stoneman change it.

1382
02:05:06,958 --> 02:05:10,586
Someday, Mama will be here.

1383
02:05:10,753 --> 02:05:13,797
And my brother, Little Frank,
and his family over there.

1384
02:05:13,965 --> 02:05:16,800
And that is for my sister Veronica
and her family.

1385
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:21,889
And I will be here,
on the other side of Papa.

1386
02:05:23,266 --> 02:05:27,186
I think it's comforting to know
where one will meet eternity, don't you?

1387
02:05:29,981 --> 02:05:32,524
I would like you
to rest beside me, Rooster.

1388
02:05:35,361 --> 02:05:38,405
Now, sis, that place
should be for your...

1389
02:05:39,407 --> 02:05:43,619
...your family, your husband, kids.

1390
02:05:50,210 --> 02:05:54,463
You have no kin.
I do not count Chen Lee and the cat.

1391
02:05:54,631 --> 02:05:58,133
Now where else would you end up,
in some neglected patch of weeds?

1392
02:05:58,801 --> 02:06:01,803
Now I might just
take you up on that offer, sis,

1393
02:06:01,971 --> 02:06:04,848
if you'll excuse me
if I don't move in too soon.

1394
02:06:07,227 --> 02:06:09,853
I think it's only right
that you have Papa's gun.

1395
02:06:10,021 --> 02:06:14,191
- It might keep you alive.
- Well, I'm not so sure about that.

1396
02:06:14,359 --> 02:06:17,236
Almost got you killed
when it misfired once.

1397
02:06:17,403 --> 02:06:18,445
That'd be 'cause you loaded it wrong

1398
02:06:18,613 --> 02:06:19,988
when you were
in a state of drunkenness.

1399
02:06:20,156 --> 02:06:22,324
Well, then I suppose
I ought to get you to show me how.

1400
02:06:22,492 --> 02:06:23,700
I will.

1401
02:06:28,998 --> 02:06:32,501
- Trust you to ride another tall horse.
- Yeah.

1402
02:06:33,670 --> 02:06:35,003
He's not as game as Bo,

1403
02:06:35,171 --> 02:06:39,341
but Stonehill says
he can jump a four-rail fence.

1404
02:06:39,509 --> 02:06:42,344
You're too old and too fat
to be jumping horses.

1405
02:06:46,349 --> 02:06:49,726
Well, come to see
a fat old man sometime.
