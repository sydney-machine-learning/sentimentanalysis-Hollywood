1
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,483
I hope you split your breeches, kid!

2
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:23,233
Control yourself, Aicha.

3
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:07,086
They talk like they were Herculeses,
all of them.

4
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:10,318
And after a few turns,
they pant, they gasp, and they wheeze.

5
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,082
- One has to give them smelling salts!
- What is the matter?

6
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,323
My shoes are soaking wet.
I shall die of cold.

7
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:18,765
- Then take them off.
- I can't. I haven't any socks on.

8
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:28,045
When the wine arrives, you pay for
it as if it were your own money.

9
00:07:08,398 --> 00:07:12,465
You should not drink so fast,
<i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec. It burns your stomach.

10
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:14,133
I'm thirsty. Please.

11
00:07:14,237 --> 00:07:16,009
Wine is for thirst.

12
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,137
- At least you did not say water.
- Water is for Americans.

13
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:22,005
Some men can swing by their heels
on the flying trapeze.

14
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:26,228
Some men can become President
of the Republic. I can drink cognac.

15
00:07:51,566 --> 00:07:54,798
Henri, I thought I'd find you here.
I've great news.

16
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:56,570
Maurice, have a drink.

17
00:07:56,571 --> 00:07:58,447
- You're made, Henri.
- Again?

18
00:07:58,448 --> 00:08:01,316
This is serious.
Guess who came into the gallery today.

19
00:08:01,317 --> 00:08:02,515
- Who?
- Camondo!

20
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:03,869
To get out of the rain?

21
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,695
- And what do you think?
- What?

22
00:08:05,696 --> 00:08:08,144
He halted by your canvas
of the woman ironing.

23
00:08:08,145 --> 00:08:11,273
Stepped back two paces, nodded twice.

24
00:08:11,586 --> 00:08:14,088
- You realize what this means, of course.
- What?

25
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:15,443
Henri, you've arrived!

26
00:08:15,444 --> 00:08:18,520
He's the greatest collector
of contemporary art in the world.

27
00:08:18,521 --> 00:08:20,865
When he buys, the painter is made.

28
00:08:20,866 --> 00:08:22,952
- Did he buy?
- Not exactly.

29
00:08:23,056 --> 00:08:25,140
I see. The sun came out
and he was in a hurry.

30
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:28,686
Mark my words, he'll be back.
I'll make a frame for the canvas tonight.

31
00:08:28,687 --> 00:08:30,875
You'd do much better to sit
and have a drink.

32
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:34,004
Trust me, Henri, the
sale's as good as made.

33
00:08:44,536 --> 00:08:47,820
Did you see that dirty-necked Algerian
step on my foot?

34
00:08:47,821 --> 00:08:49,436
I saw you kick her in the derriere.

35
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:53,502
Kick her?
One day I'll go right down her throat...

36
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,734
pull her heart out, and feed it to my cat.

37
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:59,237
If you can get at her.
She has long arms, Aicha.

38
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,219
I'll break them! I'll...

39
00:09:05,494 --> 00:09:08,622
- You kick me.
- You kicked me.

40
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:11,229
This calls for a drink. Cognac?

41
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:13,210
Thank you.

42
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:22,908
Now we're all friends again.

43
00:10:03,677 --> 00:10:07,013
I tell you, <i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec,
I am fed up with these Lorettes!

44
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:08,786
They behave like alley cats.

45
00:10:08,787 --> 00:10:12,541
A regiment of angels with flaming swords
could not keep order.

46
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,981
- That's not bad.
- Thank you.

47
00:10:16,503 --> 00:10:20,257
- It might make a good poster for the Moulin.
- It might at that.

48
00:10:20,258 --> 00:10:22,341
I'll tell you what I'll
do, <i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec.

49
00:10:22,342 --> 00:10:25,886
You make that poster,
and I'll give you free drinks for a month.

50
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:29,224
- Well, that's the best offer I've had.
- Think it over.

51
00:10:29,432 --> 00:10:31,309
<i>Away.</i>

52
00:10:31,622 --> 00:10:35,793
<i>The river goes rolling.</i>

53
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:40,171
<i>O may, O may.</i>

54
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:46,116
<i>Our love remain true.</i>

55
00:10:47,784 --> 00:10:51,537
<i>It's April again.</i>

56
00:10:51,538 --> 00:10:55,082
<i>And lovers are lining.</i>

57
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:58,731
<i>The banks of the Seine.</i>

58
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:01,964
<i>It's April again.</i>

59
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:07,178
<i>And every eye is shining.</i>

60
00:11:07,596 --> 00:11:11,765
<i>Was it love let your lucky fingers.</i>

61
00:11:11,766 --> 00:11:15,519
<i>Seek mine that you were meant to hold.</i>

62
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:20,211
<i>Was it love sang a song that lingers.</i>

63
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:26,364
<i>Now both of us are growing old.</i>

64
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:31,368
<i>Lie closer, my dear.</i>

65
00:11:31,369 --> 00:11:35,539
<i>And hear the refrain.</i>

66
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,023
<i>Of your seventeenth year.</i>

67
00:11:40,024 --> 00:11:43,777
<i>In the sun and the rain.</i>

68
00:11:43,778 --> 00:11:50,034
<i>Beside the River Seine O.</i>

69
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:56,393
<i>Away, away.</i>

70
00:11:56,394 --> 00:12:00,147
<i>The river goes rolling.</i>

71
00:12:00,148 --> 00:12:04,214
<i>O may, O may.</i>

72
00:12:04,215 --> 00:12:10,367
<i>Our love remain true.</i>

73
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:14,536
<i>It's April again.</i>

74
00:12:14,538 --> 00:12:17,873
<i>And lilacs are springing.</i>

75
00:12:17,874 --> 00:12:21,001
<i>The length of the Seine.</i>

76
00:12:21,002 --> 00:12:23,712
<i>It's April again.</i>

77
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:28,510
<i>And everyone is singing.</i>

78
00:12:28,823 --> 00:12:32,680
<i>Was it love led me on a Sunday.</i>

79
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:36,225
<i>To dance with you beneath the trees?</i>

80
00:12:36,226 --> 00:12:40,291
<i>Was it love echoed on a Monday.</i>

81
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:46,027
<i>The music of the river breeze?</i>

82
00:12:46,444 --> 00:12:50,927
<i>Lie closer, my dear.</i>

83
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:54,578
<i>And listen again.</i>

84
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:58,643
<i>To your seventeenth year.</i>

85
00:12:58,644 --> 00:13:02,084
<i>In the sun and the rain.</i>

86
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:07,716
<i>Beside the River Seine O.</i>

87
00:13:09,697 --> 00:13:14,492
<i>Away, away.</i>

88
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:19,081
<i>The river goes rolling.</i>

89
00:13:19,185 --> 00:13:23,668
<i>O may, O may.</i>

90
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:29,717
<i>Our love remain true.</i>

91
00:13:31,907 --> 00:13:37,016
<i>Lie closer again.</i>

92
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,352
<i>I danced with you here.</i>

93
00:13:41,395 --> 00:13:45,669
<i>In the sun and the rain.</i>

94
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:49,527
<i>The very next year.</i>

95
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:55,576
<i>Beside the River Seine O.</i>

96
00:14:06,524 --> 00:14:07,775
They like you tonight.

97
00:14:07,776 --> 00:14:11,947
They are cruel.
They only pretend to applaud my song.

98
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:16,013
What they really want
is another glimpse of my broken heart.

99
00:14:16,535 --> 00:14:18,828
What is wrong with me, Henri?

100
00:14:19,037 --> 00:14:24,250
Other women find love and happiness.
I find only disenchantment.

101
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:28,317
- But you find it so often.
- I know it's all my fault, Henri.

102
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:32,384
I see them as I want them to be,
not as they really are.

103
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:35,512
The mist of my dreams surrounds them.

104
00:14:35,825 --> 00:14:39,369
They walk in beauty
to the music of a shepherd's pipe.

105
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:42,759
And then the morning wind blows,
and the mist is swept away.

106
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,816
Poor Philippe. I can see him standing there
in the cold light of dawn, shivering.

107
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:50,110
Philippe? Oh, Philippe.

108
00:14:50,214 --> 00:14:53,550
What has he to do with it?
That has been over for ages.

109
00:14:53,551 --> 00:14:56,469
Forgive my confusion.
You were telling me only last week...

110
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,598
Last week, last year,
so what's the difference?

111
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:04,916
Though now that you remind me,
he was in many ways superior to Etienne.

112
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,209
So many ways.

113
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,879
Now, who is Etienne?

114
00:15:08,983 --> 00:15:12,215
Have you ever had contact
with the legal mind, Henri?

115
00:15:12,216 --> 00:15:13,466
It's beyond belief.

116
00:15:13,571 --> 00:15:18,576
I wasn't the vision of his dreams.
I was "the party of the first part."

117
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:22,433
He didn't declare his love.
He merely acknowledged:

118
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:25,249
"Whereas a state of affection exists."

119
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,836
Why couldn't you be tall and handsome?

120
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:32,027
Two more of these, and I shall be.

121
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,049
You are the only man
who has never bored me.

122
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:37,866
I am the only man who has never loved you.

123
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,994
Henri, over there.

124
00:15:41,515 --> 00:15:44,956
There is the most beautiful creature.

125
00:15:45,165 --> 00:15:47,459
Look at those shoulders.

126
00:15:48,084 --> 00:15:50,900
For your sake,
I pray that they are not padded.

127
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:01,074
Bravo!

128
00:18:39,506 --> 00:18:42,529
- Good night, <i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec.
- Good night, Sarah.

129
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,405
Can I drop you, <i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec?

130
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:47,743
There's one drink left, Zidler.
I will finish it.

131
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:25,653
No offence, little man.

132
00:20:25,654 --> 00:20:29,303
With hunchbacks and midgets,
I always rub the back for luck.

133
00:20:54,015 --> 00:20:55,995
<i>Yours is a great heritage.</i>

134
00:20:55,996 --> 00:20:58,706
<i>Your great, great, great, great,</i>
<i>great-grandfather...</i>

135
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,437
<i>Your great, great, great, great,</i>
<i>great-grandfather...</i>

136
00:20:59,438 --> 00:21:04,024
<i>Raymond, the fourth Comte de Toulouse,</i>
<i>led the Christian knights to Jerusalem...</i>

137
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:06,684
<i>and rescued the sacred tomb</i>
<i>from the wicked Turks.</i>

138
00:21:06,685 --> 00:21:08,509
We were dukes of Aquitaine...

139
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:11,846
counts of Louergue, Gercy, Albi...

140
00:21:12,576 --> 00:21:17,059
marquises of Narbonne, Gothea,
viscounts of Lautrec.

141
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:21,960
But, above all, we are
and always will be counts of Toulouse.

142
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:25,244
Today I am the head of the house.

143
00:21:25,246 --> 00:21:29,050
Some day it will be your turn.
Then your first son's turn.

144
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,908
And his son's and his son's son's.

145
00:21:33,951 --> 00:21:36,037
As long as there is France.

146
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,617
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Denise de Frontenac...

147
00:22:14,721 --> 00:22:17,849
may I present
<i>Monsieur</i> Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.

148
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,830
One, two, three.

149
00:23:10,297 --> 00:23:11,757
Papa!

150
00:23:20,412 --> 00:23:21,767
Little one...

151
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:23,644
My legs.

152
00:23:33,654 --> 00:23:35,896
The bones are not knitting as they should.

153
00:23:35,897 --> 00:23:40,015
We need the advice of a specialist.
An operation may be necessary.

154
00:23:48,356 --> 00:23:52,006
Unfortunately, <i>madame,</i>
the operation has not been a success.

155
00:23:52,214 --> 00:23:54,507
It will be necessary to re-break the legs.

156
00:23:54,508 --> 00:23:57,636
Then perhaps a better union
can be effected.

157
00:23:59,201 --> 00:24:04,310
<i>Madame,</i> you must both know the truth.
All that can be done, has been done.

158
00:24:04,831 --> 00:24:08,481
- The legs will never grow again.
- It's not true.

159
00:24:09,002 --> 00:24:12,651
- You are first cousins, are you not?
- We are.

160
00:24:13,381 --> 00:24:16,405
I am afraid that is the
root of the problem.

161
00:24:54,985 --> 00:24:58,843
You don't remember me?
I'm Denise de Frontenac.

162
00:25:00,408 --> 00:25:03,953
The time has come to be honest, Adele.
We should never have married.

163
00:25:04,057 --> 00:25:07,707
Henri's poor misshapen body
is the proof of our mistake.

164
00:25:08,124 --> 00:25:10,522
We dare not have another child.

165
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,337
That is why I must leave this house.

166
00:25:17,508 --> 00:25:20,844
But I don't love you, Henri.
It never occurred to me...

167
00:25:20,845 --> 00:25:25,745
I'll spend my life trying to make you happy.
I swear you won't regret marrying me.

168
00:25:27,205 --> 00:25:31,584
Please, you're hurting me! I wouldn't dream
of marrying you. Why, the idea's absurd!

169
00:25:31,585 --> 00:25:35,338
Why is it absurd? Because I'm a cripple?
Is that it? Because I'm a cripple?

170
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:37,737
Yes, you ugly little monster!

171
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:41,907
No girl will ever marry you, ever!
Do you hear?

172
00:25:44,931 --> 00:25:47,120
It is so easy to deceive oneself, <i>Maman.</i>

173
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:50,039
By degrees you minimize your ugliness,
your lameness...

174
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:52,229
and you begin to think of yourself...

175
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,044
as a presentable young man
with a slight limp.

176
00:25:55,046 --> 00:26:00,155
Until you are brought face to face with the
grotesque, stunted thing you really are.

177
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:06,307
Someday a woman will have eyes
to see you tall and straight.

178
00:26:06,828 --> 00:26:08,704
And she will love you.

179
00:26:08,705 --> 00:26:12,563
No woman will ever love me.
I have it on the best authority.

180
00:26:13,397 --> 00:26:16,421
<i>Maman,</i> I'm leaving here.
I am going to Paris.

181
00:26:16,838 --> 00:26:20,800
I shall become a painter.
I shall try to make a life for myself.

182
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:25,805
You will be lonely there, Riri.

183
00:26:26,535 --> 00:26:28,934
I'll be lonely anywhere, <i>Maman.</i>

184
00:26:46,451 --> 00:26:49,475
<i>Monsieur,</i> please say I'm with you?

185
00:26:56,044 --> 00:26:58,390
- Let her go. You're hurting her.
- Don't interfere!

186
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:02,874
- Leave her alone or I'll tell the police.
- Police? That's a good one. I am the police.

187
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,438
Why aren't you in uniform?

188
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:07,617
I am Sgt. Balthazar Patou.
Here are my credentials.

189
00:27:07,618 --> 00:27:11,633
It's all right, I believe you. But this
young woman has been with me all evening.

190
00:27:11,634 --> 00:27:14,499
All evening?
Don't take me for a fool, <i>monsieur.</i>

191
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,461
I know this girl, who she is,
where she comes from. Everything.

192
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:21,643
She's as bad as they come.
A real rotten apple.

193
00:27:21,644 --> 00:27:25,083
I am not a moralist, Sergeant.
I do not blame people for what they are.

194
00:27:25,085 --> 00:27:27,324
Only for seeming to be what they are not.

195
00:27:27,325 --> 00:27:29,931
- You're <i>Monsieur</i> Toulouse-Lautrec?
- That's right.

196
00:27:29,932 --> 00:27:31,757
I'm only doing my duty, you understand?

197
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:34,727
It's all right,
and I understand your mistake in the dark.

198
00:27:34,729 --> 00:27:38,378
As a matter of fact,
we just saw a woman going that way.

199
00:27:38,587 --> 00:27:41,923
- Didn't we, my dear?
- Yes, she went down that way.

200
00:27:43,174 --> 00:27:44,843
Very well, <i>monsieur.</i>

201
00:27:44,947 --> 00:27:48,544
If you choose to give her your protection,
there is nothing I can do.

202
00:27:48,545 --> 00:27:51,203
But you shouldn't amuse yourself
at the law's expense.

203
00:27:51,516 --> 00:27:52,871
You really shouldn't.

204
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:56,834
Good night, Sergeant.
Come along, my dear. It's getting late.

205
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:10,805
Can't you walk a little faster?
What's the matter with your legs?

206
00:28:10,806 --> 00:28:14,560
You don't have to stay with me.
He'll leave you alone now.

207
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:18,157
Once I knew a man
who got his arm caught in a machine.

208
00:28:18,158 --> 00:28:19,669
He was lucky, that one.

209
00:28:19,774 --> 00:28:22,379
He got 500 francs
from the insurance company.

210
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,769
- Please hurry.
- Go on, why don't you? You're safe.

211
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,584
I'd like to spit in that policeman's face.

212
00:28:28,586 --> 00:28:30,408
He let you go, didn't he?

213
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:33,746
Because of you.
They're hard to fool, the police.

214
00:28:34,267 --> 00:28:35,571
You're a sharp one.

215
00:28:35,572 --> 00:28:39,167
Look, here is a hotel. They are open
all night and you can get a room.

216
00:28:39,168 --> 00:28:42,557
- Have you got any money?
- I don't want to go to a hotel.

217
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:45,319
They won't even let you in
unless they know you.

218
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,613
And if they do,
they charge you twice the price.

219
00:28:47,614 --> 00:28:51,785
And in the morning, they tell the police
just to get the 10 franc reward.

220
00:28:52,202 --> 00:28:56,060
- You live around here?
- Yes, a little farther up the street.

221
00:28:56,373 --> 00:28:59,397
Let me stay there. I
won't make any trouble.

222
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:02,837
When you wake up in the morning,
I'll be gone.

223
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,800
Please, you can trust me.

224
00:29:07,634 --> 00:29:09,615
I won't steal anything.

225
00:29:24,213 --> 00:29:25,777
You're an artist.

226
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:31,095
Once I knew one.
He painted Cupids on soup plates.

227
00:29:32,555 --> 00:29:34,119
Got a cigarette?

228
00:29:38,498 --> 00:29:40,375
Looks like real gold.

229
00:29:41,939 --> 00:29:45,797
Once a man gave me
a pair of gold earrings. But I lost them.

230
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,570
Match?

231
00:30:16,244 --> 00:30:18,433
Were you born that way, or what?

232
00:30:18,434 --> 00:30:21,979
Go away! I don't want you here.
I didn't ask you to come.

233
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,752
Why do you get so mad?

234
00:30:30,217 --> 00:30:34,283
When I was a child, I broke my legs.
The bones wouldn't knit.

235
00:30:38,141 --> 00:30:40,018
The stove's going!

236
00:30:41,061 --> 00:30:43,667
Do you keep it going all the time?

237
00:30:45,961 --> 00:30:48,881
For an artist, you don't talk very much.

238
00:30:50,654 --> 00:30:54,303
The one who painted soup plates,
he never stopped talking.

239
00:31:10,986 --> 00:31:12,968
You can undress in there.

240
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,243
Take this lamp.

241
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:32,988
A bathtub! You have a bathtub.

242
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,637
Let me have a bath, please. Please let me.

243
00:31:37,054 --> 00:31:39,451
I'll clean up after myself, I promise.

244
00:31:39,452 --> 00:31:40,912
If you like.

245
00:31:44,145 --> 00:31:48,420
It'll be the first time I ever had a bath.
In a real bathtub, I mean.

246
00:32:14,487 --> 00:32:17,407
- Are you still there?
- Yes, I'm here.

247
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:23,768
You will sleep here.

248
00:32:25,853 --> 00:32:28,147
"I am Sgt. Balthazar Patou.

249
00:32:28,668 --> 00:32:31,796
"If you don't believe me,
I'll show you my credentials."

250
00:32:31,901 --> 00:32:33,465
I believe you.

251
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:37,792
"Give her a good, stiff sentence,
Your Honor. She's a habitual offender.

252
00:32:37,793 --> 00:32:42,536
"A menace to the morals of my district.
Also, she called me the name of a dog."

253
00:32:43,058 --> 00:32:46,290
There, I made you laugh. I knew I could.

254
00:32:47,437 --> 00:32:49,418
I'll make you like me, too.

255
00:32:52,546 --> 00:32:56,404
You have beautiful eyes
without those spectacles.

256
00:32:58,803 --> 00:33:02,452
It's the first time I was ever told that
by a policeman.

257
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:10,585
What was it that policeman called you?
<i>Monsieur</i> Toulouse something?

258
00:33:11,732 --> 00:33:12,879
Yes.

259
00:33:13,713 --> 00:33:15,903
What kind of a name is that?

260
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:17,884
My own.

261
00:33:18,406 --> 00:33:20,908
It isn't a name. It's a town.

262
00:33:21,846 --> 00:33:26,017
People don't go about calling themselves
Paris or Marseilles, do they?

263
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:32,274
But, come to think of it, I knew a
man once they called Five Points...

264
00:33:32,691 --> 00:33:37,122
after that corner in the Temple district
where all the streets come together.

265
00:33:37,123 --> 00:33:40,146
He was born
while his mother was crossing the road.

266
00:33:40,147 --> 00:33:41,970
She was delivering washing.

267
00:33:41,971 --> 00:33:45,829
He said she put him in a wash basket
and carried him home.

268
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:51,042
Are you from Toulouse? Is it the
same with you as with Five Points?

269
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:53,023
More or less.

270
00:33:54,692 --> 00:33:57,923
You didn't waste any time getting into bed,
did you?

271
00:33:57,924 --> 00:34:00,843
What's the matter? Afraid
I'd see your legs?

272
00:34:00,844 --> 00:34:04,284
Get out! Put your clothes back on
and get out of here.

273
00:34:04,285 --> 00:34:07,726
Stop shouting. Do you want to wake
everybody in the house?

274
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,374
Look, I don't care about your legs.

275
00:34:11,375 --> 00:34:14,138
It makes no difference to me
that you are a cripple.

276
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:16,797
- Do you want the light on?
- Put it out.

277
00:34:28,684 --> 00:34:31,917
You don't really want me to go, do you?

278
00:34:35,045 --> 00:34:36,087
Do you?

279
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:13,520
Did you used to sing in the mornings,
before me, I mean?

280
00:35:13,521 --> 00:35:16,857
Does a man ever sing in the morning,
when he is alone?

281
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,421
Oh, rats.

282
00:35:19,256 --> 00:35:20,506
What's the matter?

283
00:35:20,507 --> 00:35:23,374
I always mean to sketch you
with your hands in your hair.

284
00:35:23,375 --> 00:35:26,972
But the sight is so enchanting
I forget to do anything about it.

285
00:35:26,973 --> 00:35:28,640
You're nice, Toulouse.

286
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:32,394
I never thought
I'd be wearing real silk stockings.

287
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:37,816
Bébert always says they do things to him.
Even on a plaster leg in a window.

288
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:40,527
Who is Bébert?

289
00:35:40,944 --> 00:35:42,612
A fellow I know.

290
00:35:43,238 --> 00:35:45,428
But I don't like him anymore.

291
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:48,243
I finished a long time ago with him.

292
00:35:48,451 --> 00:35:52,831
He'd give anything to have me back.
But when I'm through, I'm through.

293
00:35:52,935 --> 00:35:55,438
If I saw him now, I'd spit on him.

294
00:35:56,897 --> 00:35:58,253
Pretty.

295
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:01,590
Very pretty.

296
00:36:01,902 --> 00:36:05,448
Real silk, and three pairs.

297
00:36:08,054 --> 00:36:10,765
Did you ever go to the Rue Mouffetard?

298
00:36:11,495 --> 00:36:12,955
Where is it?

299
00:36:13,268 --> 00:36:17,022
It's where I was born,
in the liquor district.

300
00:36:17,647 --> 00:36:22,339
There is a thick slime
all over the cobblestones, from the wine.

301
00:36:22,444 --> 00:36:25,989
It's so slippery
even the cats can't keep their feet.

302
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:28,179
And talk about a stink.

303
00:36:29,117 --> 00:36:33,288
I was 12 before I found out
the whole world didn't stink like that.

304
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:35,478
When I did, I left.

305
00:36:35,686 --> 00:36:38,606
I was glad to get out of
that, I can tell you.

306
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:42,464
I've only been back once, to see my mother.

307
00:36:43,924 --> 00:36:45,799
She still lives there?

308
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,867
She likes it. One thing you can say
for the Rue Mouffetard:

309
00:36:49,868 --> 00:36:52,578
You may go hungry, but never thirsty.

310
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,896
My mother has a pushcart.

311
00:36:58,417 --> 00:36:59,773
She was smart.

312
00:37:00,086 --> 00:37:03,944
When she was my age,
she put a little away each week...

313
00:37:04,048 --> 00:37:07,697
and got herself a license.
You know, saved up for it.

314
00:37:08,531 --> 00:37:12,077
When you've got a pushcart license,
you'll never starve.

315
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:15,829
Once you get it,
you never have to buy another one.

316
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:17,602
It's good for life.

317
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:20,522
- You need a new dress.
- They cost money.

318
00:37:20,523 --> 00:37:24,172
- We'll go and pick one out for you.
- You mean you'd buy me one?

319
00:37:25,423 --> 00:37:29,280
We'll go down the Rue St. Honore. We'll
find you the prettiest dress in Paris.

320
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:31,574
I know just the dress. I've even had it on.

321
00:37:31,575 --> 00:37:34,181
You won't have to come with me.
Just give me the money.

322
00:37:34,182 --> 00:37:35,381
But I want to come with you.

323
00:37:35,382 --> 00:37:38,560
It's on the other side of town
where things are not so expensive.

324
00:37:38,562 --> 00:37:40,334
It'll save you money.

325
00:37:40,438 --> 00:37:41,898
As you wish.

326
00:37:44,192 --> 00:37:45,756
100 francs!

327
00:37:47,842 --> 00:37:50,240
You're so good to me, Toulouse...

328
00:37:50,553 --> 00:37:53,994
and I'll be good to you.
Nicer than ever, you'll see.

329
00:37:54,411 --> 00:37:58,686
There'll be no complaints out of you.
I'll smother them like this.

330
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,710
It's getting late.

331
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:05,672
When will you be back?

332
00:38:05,776 --> 00:38:08,487
One hour, as soon as I get the dress.

333
00:38:47,485 --> 00:38:48,736
Come in.

334
00:38:51,238 --> 00:38:52,489
It's you, <i>Madame</i> Loubet.

335
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:55,044
- Are you all right, <i>monsieur?</i>
- Yes, of course.

336
00:38:55,045 --> 00:38:57,494
I didn't see you about last night
or this morning.

337
00:38:57,495 --> 00:38:59,579
I was afraid you were ill or something.

338
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:02,499
This room is as cold as ice
and your stove's gone out.

339
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,201
- I'll make some soup and bring it up.
- Please don't bother. I'm going out.

340
00:39:06,202 --> 00:39:09,851
- It's no bother. It's on the stove already...
- I'm going out, I said.

341
00:39:09,852 --> 00:39:12,510
I'm sorry, <i>Madame</i> Loubet.
You are very kind.

342
00:39:16,263 --> 00:39:18,036
If I starve...

343
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:21,580
I'll never take another
canvas to that dealer.

344
00:39:21,581 --> 00:39:23,562
He sucks blood, that one.

345
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:27,732
I've always got 7 francs for an Ascension.
This morning he offered me 5 francs.

346
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:32,633
He says religious sentiment is waning.
Everybody knows it's a lie.

347
00:39:32,634 --> 00:39:35,762
Go to any church on Sunday,
even a Protestant one.

348
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:37,952
Packed to the doors.

349
00:39:38,265 --> 00:39:40,036
Henri, sit with us.

350
00:39:40,037 --> 00:39:43,373
Hello, Seurat, Gauzi, Anquetin.
Waiter, a cognac.

351
00:39:43,374 --> 00:39:46,084
A round of cognacs, if you're paying.

352
00:39:46,085 --> 00:39:49,213
Is that why you called me?
Bring the bottle.

353
00:39:50,151 --> 00:39:52,445
How is the work going, Henri?

354
00:39:53,071 --> 00:39:55,991
The smell of paint sickens
me, and painters.

355
00:39:56,408 --> 00:39:59,743
- We missed you at the meeting last night.
- Meeting? What meeting?

356
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,516
The Society of Independents.

357
00:40:01,517 --> 00:40:04,228
I had better things to do. Independents!

358
00:40:04,645 --> 00:40:06,521
Pariahs, rather. Outcasts.

359
00:40:06,522 --> 00:40:09,023
It is not ideals which bind us together,
but failure.

360
00:40:09,024 --> 00:40:11,839
Call me any name.
Insult the memory of my mother.

361
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:15,750
But do not dare speak so of
the Society of Independents in my presence.

362
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:18,095
What a dismal bore you are, Anquetin.

363
00:40:18,096 --> 00:40:21,536
Drink your drink. Then we'll go
to the Louvre and refresh our souls.

364
00:40:21,537 --> 00:40:23,726
The Louvre, that graveyard.

365
00:40:23,727 --> 00:40:28,419
Graveyard! The home of the <i>Mona Lisa,</i>
and he calls it a graveyard.

366
00:40:28,836 --> 00:40:33,528
The <i>Mona Lisa.</i>
Truly the greatest painting in the world.

367
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:38,742
At this moment, I could kneel down
and give thanks to Leonardo.

368
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,243
How do you know
it is the greatest painting?

369
00:40:41,244 --> 00:40:43,329
How do you know
it was painted by Leonardo?

370
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,884
How do I know it? Because I feel it.

371
00:40:45,885 --> 00:40:47,709
I feel it here in my heart.

372
00:40:47,918 --> 00:40:51,566
I feel in my heart that you're a pompous
ass, but that doesn't make it so.

373
00:40:51,567 --> 00:40:54,487
Only Leonardo
could have painted that smile.

374
00:40:54,591 --> 00:40:57,927
- She smiles with her eyes.
- I don't care if she smiles with her navel.

375
00:40:57,928 --> 00:40:59,908
That still doesn't say da Vinci painted it.

376
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:02,723
The technique, the brush strokes.
Each bears his signature.

377
00:41:02,724 --> 00:41:05,747
There is only one way
you know the <i>Mona Lisa</i> is by Leonardo.

378
00:41:05,748 --> 00:41:07,937
By the little brass plate
with his name on it.

379
00:41:07,938 --> 00:41:11,586
That is what you bow down to,
a name printed on brass.

380
00:41:11,587 --> 00:41:13,881
Good day, gentlemen. I'm leaving.

381
00:41:16,696 --> 00:41:18,990
If I hadn't needed this drink...

382
00:41:19,824 --> 00:41:21,909
I'd have thrown it at him.

383
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,517
I wonder what has made him so unhappy.

384
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:30,980
I've been looking for you.
Guess what happened.

385
00:41:30,981 --> 00:41:33,691
I know. Camondo did not come.
You did not sell a painting.

386
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:37,915
Who cares about him? This is important.
<i>Figaro's</i> art critic wants to write about you.

387
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:39,426
Is this another delusion?

388
00:41:39,427 --> 00:41:41,929
I saw him outside the Café Noir
where he breakfasts.

389
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:45,319
I was waiting for him. I introduced myself,
told him about your work.

390
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:49,228
I was eloquent. He wants to write about you
if your paintings justify my words.

391
00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:51,679
I invited him to the gallery.
He said he would come.

392
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,190
- When?
- When he has time.

393
00:41:53,191 --> 00:41:54,442
Idiot!

394
00:42:12,794 --> 00:42:14,775
How do you like my new dress?

395
00:42:18,842 --> 00:42:21,657
I got it from a friend. Only 50 francs.

396
00:42:22,074 --> 00:42:26,035
That's cheap for real velvet.
My friend wanted more.

397
00:42:26,037 --> 00:42:29,373
She wanted 75 francs, but I beat her down.

398
00:42:32,501 --> 00:42:34,587
I love the feel of velvet.

399
00:42:35,212 --> 00:42:36,985
Feel it, Toulouse.

400
00:42:37,715 --> 00:42:39,592
Where have you been?

401
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,824
- Is that your idea of a welcome?
- Answer me.

402
00:42:44,492 --> 00:42:48,976
Hey, watch yourself, Toulouse.
You didn't buy me with that 100 francs.

403
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,104
I don't have to account
to you for anything.

404
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:56,119
If you want to know where I've been,
you'll have to ask me nice.

405
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,255
I don't have to. I know already.

406
00:42:58,256 --> 00:42:59,925
You followed me?

407
00:43:00,029 --> 00:43:03,522
I can imagine your night out.
I can see every move you made...

408
00:43:03,523 --> 00:43:07,015
from the first sour-smelling kiss
in a dark doorway...

409
00:43:07,328 --> 00:43:09,309
Well, it doesn't matter.

410
00:43:10,456 --> 00:43:12,853
You'd better go, Marie. Quickly.

411
00:43:12,854 --> 00:43:15,774
Go? I just got here. Go where?

412
00:43:16,399 --> 00:43:19,319
I don't care. Wherever you were last night.

413
00:43:28,078 --> 00:43:29,433
All right.

414
00:43:30,372 --> 00:43:32,040
Whatever you say.

415
00:43:36,941 --> 00:43:38,713
So long, Toulouse.

416
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:51,747
I'll tell you where I was, though.

417
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:57,378
First I hunted for my
friend to buy the dress.

418
00:43:57,586 --> 00:44:00,923
Then I went to see my sister. She was sick.

419
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:04,781
Very sick. She was in bed with a fever.

420
00:44:05,302 --> 00:44:08,743
I had to call a doctor.
He said someone had to stay with her.

421
00:44:08,744 --> 00:44:11,037
What could I do? My own sister.

422
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:13,747
Am I supposed to believe all that?

423
00:44:13,748 --> 00:44:18,232
I don't tell lies, Toulouse,
except sometimes to the police.

424
00:44:18,962 --> 00:44:21,359
I was a fool
ever to let you stay in this place.

425
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,446
You said I made you happy.

426
00:44:24,488 --> 00:44:26,887
I wish I'd never laid eyes on you!

427
00:44:30,536 --> 00:44:31,892
You are.

428
00:44:38,252 --> 00:44:40,129
You're in love with me.

429
00:44:41,067 --> 00:44:42,736
The real thing.

430
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:44,925
Aren't you?

431
00:44:46,594 --> 00:44:49,096
That's why you're acting like this.

432
00:44:49,409 --> 00:44:52,433
You're in love with me and you're jealous.

433
00:44:54,518 --> 00:44:57,855
Imagine being jealous over me.

434
00:44:59,419 --> 00:45:02,756
Nobody ever was before. I like it.

435
00:45:04,216 --> 00:45:06,509
But you've no cause to be jealous.

436
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:08,908
Honest, you haven't, now or ever.

437
00:45:09,221 --> 00:45:12,870
I'm so crazy about you,
I wouldn't look at anybody else.

438
00:45:13,287 --> 00:45:15,267
How many times have you said that before?

439
00:45:15,268 --> 00:45:17,979
I'm all yours, as long as you want me.

440
00:45:18,813 --> 00:45:22,880
And if you ever stop wanting me,
I don't know what I'll do.

441
00:45:25,383 --> 00:45:27,572
I'll never stop wanting you.

442
00:45:28,094 --> 00:45:31,013
Hold me, then. Hold me tight.

443
00:45:31,535 --> 00:45:33,203
Hug me. I love it.

444
00:45:46,237 --> 00:45:48,009
What day is today?

445
00:45:48,531 --> 00:45:49,782
Friday.

446
00:45:50,408 --> 00:45:52,910
My sister will be worried to death.

447
00:45:53,014 --> 00:45:56,664
She'll think I've been murdered,
or in jail again, or something.

448
00:45:57,081 --> 00:45:58,957
Hold still, my dear.

449
00:45:58,958 --> 00:46:01,669
- What are you doing?
- Painting you.

450
00:46:01,982 --> 00:46:04,588
- How long will it take?
- Not long.

451
00:46:05,005 --> 00:46:06,881
I've got to see my sister.

452
00:46:06,882 --> 00:46:10,949
- You've seen her almost every day.
- But I've got to see her today.

453
00:46:12,513 --> 00:46:16,371
Please sit still. And if you like
the portrait, I'll give it to you.

454
00:46:22,314 --> 00:46:24,608
How much is a painting worth?

455
00:46:24,921 --> 00:46:26,902
It all depends who painted it.

456
00:46:27,007 --> 00:46:28,884
One of yours, I mean.

457
00:46:29,092 --> 00:46:31,073
It's too soon to tell.

458
00:46:31,699 --> 00:46:33,784
How do you mean, too soon?

459
00:46:35,765 --> 00:46:39,884
Some 300 years ago, a man named da Vinci
painted a portrait of a woman.

460
00:46:39,885 --> 00:46:44,003
Her husband did not like it and would not pay for it.
Today, it hangs in the Louvre...

461
00:46:44,107 --> 00:46:46,870
and no one man in the world
has enough money to buy it.

462
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:50,780
What good does that do
old what's-his-name the painter?

463
00:46:51,197 --> 00:46:53,596
He had his reward. He painted it.

464
00:46:55,368 --> 00:46:57,454
Doesn't make any sense to me.

465
00:46:58,914 --> 00:47:01,102
How much do you pay your models?

466
00:47:01,103 --> 00:47:05,118
The usual rate is 3 francs for the morning,
and 5 francs for the whole day.

467
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,715
Then you should pay me.
I didn't ask you to do my portrait.

468
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:11,530
So you must pay me the same as a model.

469
00:47:11,635 --> 00:47:16,535
- I said I'd give it to you. Isn't that enough?
- How do I know it'll ever be worth anything?

470
00:47:16,536 --> 00:47:20,081
If I've got to work, you've got to pay me.
3 francs.

471
00:47:20,393 --> 00:47:24,251
A model poses four hours for that.
You haven't posed five minutes.

472
00:47:24,252 --> 00:47:27,484
If you won't pay me,
then I won't pose for you.

473
00:47:29,673 --> 00:47:31,655
It doesn't look like me.

474
00:47:31,967 --> 00:47:35,825
I'm prettier than that!
I knew you didn't know how to paint.

475
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:37,963
The one who painted soup plates, he was...

476
00:47:37,964 --> 00:47:40,934
Get out! Leave me alone!
Go back to him. I don't care.

477
00:47:40,935 --> 00:47:45,000
What about my 3 francs? Now you don't
want me to pose so you need not pay me.

478
00:47:45,001 --> 00:47:46,669
- You owe me the money!
- Here, take it!

479
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:50,267
You bet I'll take it.
And I'll get out, too, like you told me!

480
00:47:50,268 --> 00:47:52,822
I'm sick of this place, sick of you!

481
00:48:27,544 --> 00:48:30,151
Forgive me, Toulouse. I'm awful.

482
00:48:31,506 --> 00:48:33,903
I don't know why you put up with me.

483
00:48:33,904 --> 00:48:37,762
All the other men I've known
would beat me up and kick me out.

484
00:48:38,179 --> 00:48:40,369
Is that what I should do?

485
00:48:40,473 --> 00:48:44,644
I could, you know. I'm very strong.
My arms make up for my legs.

486
00:48:46,313 --> 00:48:47,981
I wouldn't hurt you.

487
00:48:48,398 --> 00:48:51,735
I want to be good to you.
Please let me, Marie.

488
00:48:52,673 --> 00:48:55,906
Let me have the joy
of giving you things freely.

489
00:48:56,531 --> 00:48:59,346
Don't put a tariff on everything you do.

490
00:49:00,389 --> 00:49:02,058
I'll try, Toulouse.

491
00:49:02,683 --> 00:49:05,080
I don't know what gets into me.

492
00:49:05,081 --> 00:49:07,792
I don't know why I say the things I do.

493
00:49:08,105 --> 00:49:11,962
If I were sick of you,
I'd have kept on going down those stairs.

494
00:49:11,963 --> 00:49:14,882
I'm just as crazy about you as ever I was.

495
00:49:14,883 --> 00:49:17,802
I know you don't mean
half the things you say.

496
00:49:17,803 --> 00:49:22,181
The streets of Paris have taught you
to strike quickly and draw blood first.

497
00:49:22,182 --> 00:49:27,395
Maybe that's it. Maybe it's being cooped up
in this room that's getting on my nerves.

498
00:49:27,917 --> 00:49:30,628
I've never been so long in one place.

499
00:49:30,941 --> 00:49:33,755
Sometimes I feel like I was back in jail.

500
00:49:33,756 --> 00:49:35,840
We'll go out.
We'll make tonight an occasion.

501
00:49:35,841 --> 00:49:38,447
We'll dress up
and go to the Pre Catalan in the Bois.

502
00:49:38,448 --> 00:49:41,680
You'll love it, Marie.
You'll have a wonderful time.

503
00:49:41,889 --> 00:49:45,956
I don't like those fancy places where
the waiters look down their noses at you.

504
00:49:45,957 --> 00:49:48,458
How do you know? You've never been.

505
00:49:49,918 --> 00:49:51,378
All right.

506
00:49:55,027 --> 00:49:59,146
<i>- Monsieur</i> Lautrec, this is a pleasure.
- Good evening, Felix. It's been a long time.

507
00:49:59,147 --> 00:50:01,283
Too long. Your father, the Comte...

508
00:50:01,388 --> 00:50:04,255
did us the honor
of dining with us last week.

509
00:50:04,256 --> 00:50:06,392
- Do you have a table for us?
- But of course.

510
00:50:06,393 --> 00:50:08,061
Thank you, Felix.

511
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:22,346
Good evening, <i>monsieur.</i>

512
00:50:24,014 --> 00:50:25,786
You have a good champagne nature?

513
00:50:25,787 --> 00:50:29,228
- It is perfection.
- Good. A champagne nature to start.

514
00:50:29,437 --> 00:50:32,773
Then for food,
I think a Coquille St. Jacques first.

515
00:50:32,878 --> 00:50:36,006
Then Pheasant Under Glass.
And the sauce...

516
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,508
I know, <i>monsieur.</i> With the armagnac.

517
00:50:39,447 --> 00:50:41,741
And to drink, Pommard '89.

518
00:50:42,262 --> 00:50:44,138
Very good, <i>monsieur.</i>

519
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:48,049
- Have you ever had champagne nature?
- Sure, plenty of times.

520
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:52,376
What did he mean, "Your father,
the Comte"? Is it a joke or something?

521
00:50:52,585 --> 00:50:56,338
My father still lives in a world
where people use titles.

522
00:50:56,443 --> 00:50:57,694
The wine.

523
00:51:09,685 --> 00:51:11,353
To you, my dear.

524
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,836
That man over there is staring at me.

525
00:51:15,837 --> 00:51:17,087
And who shall blame him?

526
00:51:17,088 --> 00:51:21,154
Every man in the room would be looking at
you, were he not afraid of his companion.

527
00:51:21,155 --> 00:51:23,345
- More wine?
- Slop.

528
00:51:23,866 --> 00:51:25,274
Would you like something else?

529
00:51:25,275 --> 00:51:28,870
Why doesn't that orchestra
play something with some life in it?

530
00:51:28,871 --> 00:51:30,538
They'll play anything you ask for.

531
00:51:30,539 --> 00:51:34,293
Why don't they bring our food?
The service isn't very good.

532
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:36,587
It takes time to prepare.

533
00:51:36,796 --> 00:51:40,549
Anyway, they ought to have things ready.
They charge enough, I bet.

534
00:51:40,654 --> 00:51:45,242
- How much do they charge for that wine?
- You must learn not to think of the cost.

535
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:51,029
Isn't it a lovely room? That table is
reserved for the President of the Republic.

536
00:51:51,030 --> 00:51:53,375
- I'm sick.
- What's the matter?

537
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:55,669
I don't feel well, that's all.

538
00:51:56,399 --> 00:51:59,527
It's too close in here.
There isn't any air.

539
00:52:11,414 --> 00:52:13,915
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. Why?

540
00:52:13,916 --> 00:52:15,689
Are you really ill?

541
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,632
Can't you walk any faster than that?

542
00:52:22,883 --> 00:52:26,585
- How did you break them anyway?
- I told you, I slipped on the floor.

543
00:52:26,586 --> 00:52:28,983
There must have been
something wrong with you.

544
00:52:28,984 --> 00:52:32,581
Kids fall all the time
and they don't break their legs.

545
00:52:32,893 --> 00:52:36,229
- Did you have to use crutches?
- Yes, for a while.

546
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:38,680
- What did your mother do when...
- That's enough!

547
00:52:38,681 --> 00:52:43,425
There you go again, losing your temper.
You're a hard one to get along with.

548
00:52:43,529 --> 00:52:46,135
- I was only talking about your legs.
- Shut up!

549
00:52:46,136 --> 00:52:51,035
Go ahead, hit me.
Make out you're a real man. I dare you.

550
00:52:51,037 --> 00:52:52,287
Go off, before I do.

551
00:52:52,288 --> 00:52:56,040
Look at him, full of fight.
Throw it at me, why don't you?

552
00:52:56,042 --> 00:52:58,283
Or buy yourself a new pair of legs.

553
00:52:58,284 --> 00:53:00,420
Go back to the Rue Mouffetard
where you belong!

554
00:53:00,421 --> 00:53:03,235
That's right, Toulouse.
My father wasn't a count.

555
00:53:03,236 --> 00:53:06,729
I'm scum. Real scum.
That's why you hang on to me.

556
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:10,743
You know if you can't hold someone
like me, you'll never hold any woman!

557
00:53:10,744 --> 00:53:13,507
Before morning,
you'll come crawling after me...

558
00:53:13,508 --> 00:53:16,374
begging me to come back,
if you know where to look!

559
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:17,730
Hey, cabby!

560
00:53:18,147 --> 00:53:21,795
So long, Toulouse.
You won't be singing tomorrow morning.

561
00:53:21,796 --> 00:53:24,299
Rue du Poirier, and I'm in a hurry.

562
00:53:38,271 --> 00:53:40,044
Let me in, Toulouse.

563
00:53:40,357 --> 00:53:43,172
I know you're there.
I saw the light from below.

564
00:53:45,466 --> 00:53:48,177
I didn't mean all those things I said.

565
00:53:49,428 --> 00:53:51,618
Please, let me in.

566
00:53:52,556 --> 00:53:55,684
I'll be good. I'll be good to you.

567
00:53:56,519 --> 00:54:00,116
I'll do anything you want.
I'm so crazy about you.

568
00:54:00,117 --> 00:54:04,026
Would you like me to pose for you?
I won't charge you anything.

569
00:54:04,443 --> 00:54:07,362
I'll pose in the altogether, if you want.

570
00:54:07,363 --> 00:54:09,761
Only don't send me away.

571
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:13,828
I can't stand it if you do.
I'll kill myself in the Seine.

572
00:54:14,453 --> 00:54:16,017
Honest, I will.

573
00:54:18,624 --> 00:54:22,064
Let me in. I'll never
quarrel with you again...

574
00:54:22,065 --> 00:54:26,653
or say mean things.
All I want is to be good to you.

575
00:54:26,861 --> 00:54:30,407
Make you happy,
happier than you've ever been.

576
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,326
You'll never get another girl like me.

577
00:54:34,578 --> 00:54:37,914
Please, Toulouse, don't be mean to me.

578
00:54:39,895 --> 00:54:42,397
I won't come back again, Toulouse.

579
00:54:42,398 --> 00:54:44,379
This is your last chance.

580
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:48,863
I'll count to three, that's all,
and then I'm gone.

581
00:54:50,427 --> 00:54:51,678
One...

582
00:54:54,285 --> 00:54:55,536
two...

583
00:54:59,081 --> 00:55:00,124
three!

584
00:56:13,322 --> 00:56:16,971
<i>Madame</i> la Comtesse,
I'm so glad you are here.

585
00:56:16,972 --> 00:56:18,118
Where is my son?

586
00:56:18,119 --> 00:56:22,184
Upstairs, as I wrote you.
In 11 days, he has not left that room.

587
00:56:22,185 --> 00:56:24,688
I send him food,
but it comes back untouched.

588
00:56:24,689 --> 00:56:27,607
He always drinks. He will kill himself.

589
00:56:27,712 --> 00:56:31,048
But why? What is the matter with him,
do you know?

590
00:56:31,778 --> 00:56:33,759
There was a girl, <i>madame.</i>

591
00:56:39,911 --> 00:56:41,162
Go away.

592
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:57,429
<i>Maman,</i> I'm so sorry. Why did you not write?
I would have met your train.

593
00:56:57,742 --> 00:56:59,617
How are you, Riri?

594
00:56:59,618 --> 00:57:02,851
Never better, <i>Maman.</i>
I've been working very hard.

595
00:57:03,164 --> 00:57:07,439
Will you just give me five minutes
to comb my hair and put on a tie?

596
00:57:09,003 --> 00:57:11,401
What kind of girl is she, Riri?

597
00:57:12,652 --> 00:57:17,136
Your bearded son is just as transparent
as when he was a little boy of 9.

598
00:57:17,137 --> 00:57:18,179
Tell me.

599
00:57:20,785 --> 00:57:23,288
The kind you will never know, <i>Maman.</i>

600
00:57:23,496 --> 00:57:25,268
When she was a child...

601
00:57:25,269 --> 00:57:29,127
she had to choose between the streets
and the river.

602
00:57:29,857 --> 00:57:31,525
But you love her?

603
00:57:33,715 --> 00:57:38,199
It is all I can do to keep from going
after her and begging her to come back.

604
00:57:38,616 --> 00:57:40,701
What happened between you?

605
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,957
Her past was too strong for her.

606
00:57:47,479 --> 00:57:51,545
The world she lives in is a jungle,
where people prowl like wild animals.

607
00:57:51,962 --> 00:57:54,985
They go without eating
when the game is scarce.

608
00:57:54,986 --> 00:57:59,053
And when there is a kill,
they claw and bite each other over it.

609
00:57:59,157 --> 00:58:01,868
It is a world of cruelty and cunning.

610
00:58:02,494 --> 00:58:04,058
But it is free.

611
00:58:05,309 --> 00:58:08,750
I put chains on her.
They only made her vicious.

612
00:58:09,793 --> 00:58:14,172
One night she broke them,
and escaped into her alleyways.

613
00:58:15,945 --> 00:58:19,386
How could you expect such a woman
to care for anyone?

614
00:58:21,471 --> 00:58:25,016
In the jungle
they feel neither pity nor revulsion.

615
00:58:25,955 --> 00:58:28,666
The sight of me did not offend her
as a woman.

616
00:58:28,874 --> 00:58:32,732
She did not see me tall and straight
as you once prophesied.

617
00:58:32,837 --> 00:58:34,922
Her eyes were wide open.

618
00:58:35,339 --> 00:58:37,529
She loved me for what I am.

619
00:58:40,031 --> 00:58:42,534
If only I knew more of the world.

620
00:58:43,368 --> 00:58:45,557
It is your father you need now.

621
00:58:45,558 --> 00:58:48,893
To what purpose?
To tell me that a Comte de Toulouse...

622
00:58:48,894 --> 00:58:52,126
does not permit himself
to fall in love with such a girl?

623
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:55,046
To say that a cripple has no right to...

624
00:58:57,132 --> 00:59:00,468
Forgive me, <i>Maman.</i>
It was the cognac speaking.

625
00:59:03,492 --> 00:59:05,161
How are things at Albi?

626
00:59:05,578 --> 00:59:09,436
As always, Riri.
Your room kept ready for you.

627
00:59:10,687 --> 00:59:13,711
Perhaps next summer
I can spend a few weeks.

628
00:59:13,919 --> 00:59:16,839
Come home now, Riri. Give up this life.

629
00:59:19,341 --> 00:59:24,137
It is the only one I have, <i>Maman.</i> It is
not all dissipation, as you might think.

630
00:59:24,138 --> 00:59:26,640
There is some virtue in it, too.

631
00:59:27,058 --> 00:59:30,081
These canvases are your son.

632
00:59:30,811 --> 00:59:33,835
Not a miserable cripple with shrunken legs.

633
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:40,508
Can you not paint at home, Riri?

634
00:59:40,926 --> 00:59:43,220
The countryside is so beautiful.

635
00:59:44,054 --> 00:59:47,078
I have a friend, <i>Maman.
</i> He is a painter, too.

636
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:49,684
His name is Vincent van Gogh.

637
00:59:50,414 --> 00:59:53,647
He paints wheat fields
hot with the sun of Provence.

638
00:59:54,689 --> 00:59:58,964
A man can stare at one of his canvases
and go blind with the light.

639
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,467
I cannot paint his fields...

640
01:00:01,988 --> 01:00:04,908
but he cannot paint
my girls of the Moulin Rouge.

641
01:00:05,116 --> 01:00:08,557
I am a painter of the streets
and of the gutter.

642
01:00:10,747 --> 01:00:13,771
It is no accident that I met Marie Charlet.

643
01:00:16,378 --> 01:00:18,984
Show me your latest painting, Riri.

644
01:00:21,591 --> 01:00:22,634
This.

645
01:00:33,791 --> 01:00:35,355
The paint is dry.

646
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:44,531
Sometimes one's inspiration falters.

647
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:56,939
- Forgive me, <i>Maman.</i>
- Go and find her, Riri.

648
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:00,588
You cannot kill the pain of losing her
with cognac...

649
01:01:00,589 --> 01:01:02,777
the way you can the pain in your legs.

650
01:01:02,778 --> 01:01:04,759
You can only kill yourself.

651
01:01:05,072 --> 01:01:08,200
I offend my own conscience
by saying this...

652
01:01:08,826 --> 01:01:11,120
but I care more for your survival.

653
01:01:11,746 --> 01:01:13,414
Bring her back.

654
01:02:17,749 --> 01:02:19,209
Stop here.

655
01:02:29,115 --> 01:02:32,451
I'm sorry, <i>mademoiselle.</i>
I mistook you for somebody else.

656
01:02:33,077 --> 01:02:35,684
She can't be much if
she'd take up with you.

657
01:03:28,653 --> 01:03:29,592
<i>Monsieur?</i>

658
01:03:30,217 --> 01:03:31,260
Cognac.

659
01:03:31,886 --> 01:03:34,075
- Rum only.
- Rum, then.

660
01:03:35,744 --> 01:03:39,654
I used to have a bottle of cognac.
But my wife, she likes it.

661
01:03:39,655 --> 01:03:41,374
She drank it up herself.

662
01:03:42,209 --> 01:03:43,667
I'm looking for a girl.

663
01:03:43,668 --> 01:03:46,379
You may know her.
Her name is Marie Charlet.

664
01:03:51,384 --> 01:03:53,157
Her sister lives in this neighborhood.

665
01:03:53,261 --> 01:03:55,138
She has no sister.

666
01:03:57,641 --> 01:03:59,517
You know Marie Charlet?

667
01:04:05,044 --> 01:04:08,067
Rue de la Planchette, the Bon Vivant.

668
01:04:08,068 --> 01:04:10,779
She hangs out there. You have only to wait.

669
01:05:07,398 --> 01:05:10,422
Want to dance? Buy me wine.

670
01:05:15,322 --> 01:05:17,512
I've come to take you home.

671
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:22,830
Hello, Toulouse.

672
01:05:24,290 --> 01:05:25,854
Come on, Marie.

673
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:30,650
- Marie, I said that I...
- I heard you. You've come after me.

674
01:05:30,755 --> 01:05:33,674
What do you want me to do? Kiss your feet?

675
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:38,054
Hey, Giselle, send your man over here.

676
01:05:53,277 --> 01:05:54,737
Look who's here.

677
01:05:55,362 --> 01:05:59,012
My rich cripple from Montmartre.
He's come after me.

678
01:05:59,742 --> 01:06:02,557
He'll give me anything I want, won't you?

679
01:06:03,183 --> 01:06:04,746
50 francs a day.

680
01:06:04,747 --> 01:06:08,501
100 francs. It makes no difference to him.
He's got millions.

681
01:06:08,918 --> 01:06:10,482
Haven't you, Toulouse?

682
01:06:11,107 --> 01:06:13,193
His father is a count.

683
01:06:13,818 --> 01:06:17,155
Now, Bébert, what have you got to say?

684
01:06:17,259 --> 01:06:20,179
Don't listen to her, <i>monsieur.</i> She's drunk.

685
01:06:21,535 --> 01:06:24,454
For sure, Bébert. My Bébert!

686
01:06:24,871 --> 01:06:28,104
Why did you think I stayed with you
one night even?

687
01:06:28,312 --> 01:06:30,606
For love of your ugly face?

688
01:06:30,815 --> 01:06:34,568
A runt, that's what you are.
A runt and a cripple!

689
01:06:35,194 --> 01:06:37,592
It made me sick when you touched me.

690
01:06:37,801 --> 01:06:41,033
I'd never have come back except for Bébert.

691
01:06:41,242 --> 01:06:43,848
To keep him in silk shirts and pomade.

692
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:48,436
<i>Monsieur,</i> I beg of you.
She doesn't know what she's saying.

693
01:06:48,645 --> 01:06:52,086
Believe me, she holds
only the tenderest feelings for you.

694
01:06:52,087 --> 01:06:53,754
Get out of my way!

695
01:06:54,797 --> 01:06:59,385
I told you he'd come back, Bébert.
I told you he couldn't live without me...

696
01:06:59,489 --> 01:06:59,906
but you wouldn't listen.

697
01:06:59,907 --> 01:07:01,470
But you wouldn't listen.

698
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:04,598
You threw me over for a mangy redhead...

699
01:07:04,807 --> 01:07:07,725
with a few measly francs in her stocking.

700
01:07:07,727 --> 01:07:10,646
You sold out cheap, Bébert.

701
01:07:10,959 --> 01:07:12,419
Too cheap.

702
01:11:48,298 --> 01:11:49,758
<i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec!

703
01:11:49,862 --> 01:11:53,460
- A cognac if you please, Sarah.
- Where have you been? It has been weeks.

704
01:11:53,461 --> 01:11:56,222
- Have you been ill?
- A malady of the mind only.

705
01:11:56,223 --> 01:11:58,307
- Where is Zidler?
- In his office.

706
01:11:58,308 --> 01:12:02,374
Now that you are back, he will have
no cause to complain of bad business.

707
01:12:02,375 --> 01:12:07,171
I am no longer an asset, Sarah. Zidler has
to supply me with free drinks for a month.

708
01:12:07,172 --> 01:12:08,943
I am furious with you.

709
01:12:08,944 --> 01:12:12,801
Why did you allow me
to make such a ridiculous fool of myself?

710
01:12:12,802 --> 01:12:15,096
That mountebank of a guardsman.

711
01:12:15,617 --> 01:12:20,309
Have you ever had contact
with the military mind? It's fantastic.

712
01:12:20,727 --> 01:12:24,637
There is nothing one does
except according to the military manual.

713
01:12:24,638 --> 01:12:26,044
But absolutely nothing.

714
01:12:26,149 --> 01:12:30,424
- I was afraid those shoulders were padded.
- What has padding to do with it?

715
01:12:30,425 --> 01:12:35,219
<i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec, where have you been?
How we have missed you!

716
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:37,305
- I have something for you.
- What's that?

717
01:12:37,306 --> 01:12:39,912
You commissioned me to do a poster.

718
01:12:40,747 --> 01:12:41,788
Well?

719
01:12:41,789 --> 01:12:44,813
It's good, very good.

720
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:47,002
I like it immensely, but...

721
01:12:47,003 --> 01:12:49,088
- But what?
- It's so very different.

722
01:12:49,089 --> 01:12:50,131
I hope so.

723
01:12:50,235 --> 01:12:52,842
If you are going to do a poster,
it should be of me.

724
01:12:52,946 --> 01:12:56,596
I am the attraction here.
It's my singing that draws the crowd.

725
01:12:56,597 --> 01:12:59,410
Forgive me, but it's much harder
to draw a song than a dance.

726
01:12:59,411 --> 01:13:03,113
- I also dance.
- To be sure, and most exquisitely.

727
01:13:03,114 --> 01:13:05,666
True, <i>monsieur,</i> it is striking.
Most striking.

728
01:13:05,667 --> 01:13:09,107
But doesn't it make the Moulin Rouge
seem a little small?

729
01:13:09,108 --> 01:13:12,027
After all, it holds some 2,000 persons...

730
01:13:12,028 --> 01:13:14,634
and you only show, one, two, three, four.

731
01:13:14,635 --> 01:13:18,336
- I have not got an Adam's apple like that.
- True, Valentin, true.

732
01:13:18,337 --> 01:13:22,454
It is an exaggeration. But you must allow
an artist to take certain liberties.

733
01:13:22,455 --> 01:13:24,332
But not with my Adam's apple.

734
01:13:24,436 --> 01:13:28,190
The point is, Zidler, this makes
La Goulue seem to be the star here...

735
01:13:28,191 --> 01:13:31,943
- which is false and misleading.
- I leave it to anybody.

736
01:13:31,944 --> 01:13:34,238
Have I got an Adam's apple like that?

737
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:36,426
Is that supposed to be me?

738
01:13:36,427 --> 01:13:39,241
It couldn't be. Her linen is clean.

739
01:13:39,243 --> 01:13:41,901
- Which could never be said of your neck.
- Ladies, ladies!

740
01:13:41,902 --> 01:13:43,518
- Carrion!
- Gutter filth!

741
01:13:43,622 --> 01:13:47,167
- You will drink your own bathwater.
- You drink other peoples'.

742
01:14:07,396 --> 01:14:09,794
- You can't print that.
- Why not?

743
01:14:10,107 --> 01:14:13,443
Because there are no such colors
in lithography.

744
01:14:13,548 --> 01:14:17,614
What kind of green is that?
It looks like green, but it isn't.

745
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:22,514
It's blue, pink, yellow, gray.
Anything but green.

746
01:14:22,515 --> 01:14:25,435
I mixed the paints. I shall blend the inks.

747
01:14:35,757 --> 01:14:38,156
Imbecile. What are you doing?

748
01:14:38,886 --> 01:14:42,952
- Stippling the stone.
- No, it's impossible.

749
01:14:43,161 --> 01:14:46,289
Nobody has ever done crachis
with a toothbrush.

750
01:14:47,227 --> 01:14:48,687
It seems to work.

751
01:14:54,943 --> 01:14:55,986
Perfect.

752
01:15:01,929 --> 01:15:05,683
Not enough acid,
and the solution won't bite.

753
01:15:06,309 --> 01:15:10,375
Too much, and the fine lines will break.

754
01:16:31,915 --> 01:16:34,731
Good evening, <i>Monsieur</i> Toulouse-Lautrec.

755
01:16:35,043 --> 01:16:37,024
Good evening, Sergeant.

756
01:16:37,233 --> 01:16:40,883
I was wondering
could I ask a great favor of you?

757
01:16:41,091 --> 01:16:44,531
- Name it.
- I have a daughter. She is to be married.

758
01:16:44,532 --> 01:16:48,389
Her fiancé is a good man. At present,
he is a guard at Roquette Prison...

759
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:51,518
but he has already been promoted
to the guillotine section.

760
01:16:51,519 --> 01:16:52,874
A post of trust.

761
01:16:53,186 --> 01:16:56,992
Mark my words, some day he'll be a captain.
Perhaps an inspector.

762
01:16:56,993 --> 01:16:59,442
You will congratulate your daughter for me,
I hope.

763
01:16:59,443 --> 01:17:02,258
Thank you, <i>monsieur.</i> But I shall miss her.

764
01:17:03,301 --> 01:17:07,263
If I had a portrait of her,
I could keep it on my mantelpiece.

765
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:11,016
Of course, I am a poor man,
but I could pay something.

766
01:17:11,017 --> 01:17:15,292
Bring your daughter to my studio.
The portrait can be my wedding present.

767
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,898
<i>Monsieur,</i> I would be so grateful.

768
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:21,652
- Would you do me a favor in return?
- As you said, name it.

769
01:17:24,676 --> 01:17:26,240
Here's 1,500 francs.

770
01:17:26,866 --> 01:17:29,994
I want you to take out a license
for a pushcart...

771
01:17:29,995 --> 01:17:32,080
in the name of Marie Charlet.

772
01:17:33,331 --> 01:17:35,312
See that it is given to her.

773
01:17:45,948 --> 01:17:47,512
It's an outrage.

774
01:17:51,474 --> 01:17:52,829
It's disgusting!

775
01:17:53,768 --> 01:17:55,228
<i>Magnifique.</i>

776
01:17:57,313 --> 01:18:01,692
You should be horsewhipped for smearing
our name over every kiosk in Paris.

777
01:18:01,694 --> 01:18:03,882
That revolting poster is a disgrace.

778
01:18:04,612 --> 01:18:06,905
I'm sorry you do not like my work, Father.

779
01:18:06,906 --> 01:18:11,285
But I shall continue to sign it as I please,
for it is my name and it is my work.

780
01:18:11,494 --> 01:18:15,456
Work? A pretext to hang about
cheap dancehalls and drink all night.

781
01:18:15,561 --> 01:18:18,272
You call that pornographic trash work?

782
01:18:18,376 --> 01:18:20,044
Yes, I call it work.

783
01:18:20,148 --> 01:18:22,912
On this, I am more of an authority
than you, Father.

784
01:18:22,913 --> 01:18:25,466
You've never worked. Our kind never did.

785
01:18:25,571 --> 01:18:28,072
We are the <i>grands seigneurs.</i>
We are above work.

786
01:18:28,073 --> 01:18:33,234
We cloak ourselves in the glory of our name
as if it were an achievement just to be born.

787
01:18:33,235 --> 01:18:36,414
The truth is our world died
with Versailles and Marie Antoinette.

788
01:18:36,415 --> 01:18:39,020
We are the fossils of a bygone age...

789
01:18:39,021 --> 01:18:41,628
and I have dared to break the pattern.

790
01:18:41,941 --> 01:18:45,069
I work. And, as you say, I drink.

791
01:18:45,591 --> 01:18:47,467
A little more each day.

792
01:18:47,572 --> 01:18:50,283
Thus I forget my loneliness
and my ugliness...

793
01:18:50,491 --> 01:18:52,160
and the pain in my legs.

794
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:54,974
We each have our own escape, you see.

795
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:56,539
Mother, her prayers.

796
01:18:56,643 --> 01:19:01,023
You, your horses and your falcons
and your dreams of an age that is no more.

797
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,795
And I...

798
01:19:04,672 --> 01:19:05,923
my cognac.

799
01:19:07,592 --> 01:19:11,867
So let us put an end to this scene, Father,
for it serves no purpose.

800
01:19:12,805 --> 01:19:15,933
We won't meet again, Henri.
Live as you please.

801
01:19:16,246 --> 01:19:20,103
But don't call on me for help
as I shall not give it to you.

802
01:19:20,104 --> 01:19:24,484
You did not give it in the past.
I shall not expect it in the future.

803
01:19:42,001 --> 01:19:45,390
- Big crowd tonight.
- Too big, thanks to your poster.

804
01:19:45,391 --> 01:19:48,986
I know I'm making millions,
but I liked the Moulin Rouge as she was:

805
01:19:48,987 --> 01:19:50,916
Lightheaded and hot-blooded.

806
01:19:50,917 --> 01:19:53,732
A little strumpet
who thought only of tonight.

807
01:19:53,733 --> 01:19:57,328
Now she's grown up and knows better.
She has money in her stocking...

808
01:19:57,329 --> 01:20:00,092
wears corsets,
and never drinks a drop too much.

809
01:20:00,093 --> 01:20:02,854
Worst of all,
she never sees her old friends anymore.

810
01:20:02,855 --> 01:20:04,731
She has gone into society.

811
01:20:04,732 --> 01:20:08,693
Last night, she entertained
a cabinet minister, his wife, and daughter.

812
01:20:08,694 --> 01:20:10,154
It's disgusting.

813
01:20:10,363 --> 01:20:12,917
You are to paint my portrait. Life-size.

814
01:20:12,919 --> 01:20:14,428
- He insists.
- Who is he?

815
01:20:14,429 --> 01:20:17,035
I haven't heard
around whom your life revolves this week.

816
01:20:17,036 --> 01:20:21,310
Don't be cynical. It's not for this week.
It's for eternity.

817
01:20:21,311 --> 01:20:25,690
- He is the most divine...
- Of this, I am sure. Has he a name?

818
01:20:25,691 --> 01:20:27,255
Paul Biradiaut.

819
01:20:27,463 --> 01:20:31,478
If you must chose for eternity, one can
hardly do better than the Bank of France.

820
01:20:31,479 --> 01:20:35,596
Don't be coarse. You know that money
means nothing to me. But nothing!

821
01:20:35,701 --> 01:20:38,412
- You see what's approaching?
- Is that...

822
01:20:38,516 --> 01:20:39,559
Can that be...

823
01:20:39,663 --> 01:20:42,687
Before, she was difficult.
Now she's impossible.

824
01:20:44,251 --> 01:20:46,022
There you are, Zidler.

825
01:20:46,023 --> 01:20:50,507
- Don't "Zidler" me, you...
- You will rise, please, on my approach.

826
01:20:51,237 --> 01:20:53,427
I insist upon politeness.

827
01:20:53,844 --> 01:20:56,346
I am the <i>premiere danseuse</i> here...

828
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:58,535
and entitled to courtesy.

829
01:20:58,536 --> 01:21:01,351
Good evening, <i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec.

830
01:21:02,081 --> 01:21:04,584
Waiter, a glass for La Goulue.

831
01:21:04,897 --> 01:21:08,025
- I only drink champagne.
- But naturally.

832
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:12,717
Moët et Chandon,
and be sure it's '78 vintage.

833
01:21:14,802 --> 01:21:16,679
I think I shall sell out.

834
01:22:50,314 --> 01:22:52,400
Driver, stop a moment.

835
01:23:10,230 --> 01:23:14,192
The morning wind is cold,
but not so cold as the waters of the Seine.

836
01:23:15,548 --> 01:23:19,615
You are mistaken, <i>monsieur.</i>
I am not a candidate for the river.

837
01:23:19,823 --> 01:23:22,950
We are all candidates
when driven by the mania of love.

838
01:23:22,951 --> 01:23:26,184
Must it be love that brought me
to the Pont d'Alexandre?

839
01:23:26,705 --> 01:23:27,852
What else?

840
01:23:27,956 --> 01:23:31,137
The latest creations
are not worn by those in dire poverty.

841
01:23:31,138 --> 01:23:32,753
Believe me, <i>monsieur...</i>

842
01:23:32,961 --> 01:23:35,881
I didn't come here
to throw myself in the river.

843
01:23:36,194 --> 01:23:37,341
Only this.

844
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,990
So now we can both go home.

845
01:23:41,303 --> 01:23:44,952
- My carriage is at your disposal.
- Good morning, <i>monsieur.</i>

846
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:07,006
I do not see the signature.
I buy nothing that is not signed.

847
01:24:07,007 --> 01:24:09,247
The signature is on the back,
<i>Monsieur</i> Camondo.

848
01:24:09,248 --> 01:24:11,958
But if you would like one
on the front of the painting...

849
01:24:11,959 --> 01:24:14,044
I'm sure <i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec
would be glad to...

850
01:24:14,148 --> 01:24:16,703
Where is he?
Supposed to be here, is he not?

851
01:24:16,704 --> 01:24:20,195
Yes, <i>Monsieur</i> Camondo, of course.
I expect him at any moment.

852
01:24:20,196 --> 01:24:23,011
I buy nothing that is not signed.

853
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:25,722
Do you suppose he really looks like that?

854
01:24:27,078 --> 01:24:29,685
From what I've heard, it's very flattering.

855
01:24:30,206 --> 01:24:31,874
Here he is, in the flesh.

856
01:24:39,486 --> 01:24:42,301
<i>Madame. Monsieur.</i>

857
01:24:46,785 --> 01:24:51,477
- You've been drinking again.
- One must be fortified for such an occasion.

858
01:24:52,103 --> 01:24:55,492
<i>Monsieur</i> la Fontaine,
I am honored by your presence.

859
01:24:55,493 --> 01:24:57,941
- Camondo's here.
- Is it raining?

860
01:24:57,942 --> 01:24:59,715
Are you <i>Monsieur</i> Joyant?

861
01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:02,530
- Yes, <i>madame.</i>
- You should be arrested.

862
01:25:02,947 --> 01:25:07,639
To hang such a thing on your wall!
Look at this woman. She is undressing.

863
01:25:07,744 --> 01:25:09,620
With a man looking on.

864
01:25:09,829 --> 01:25:11,289
Disgusting!

865
01:25:12,019 --> 01:25:13,477
Forgive me, <i>madame.</i>

866
01:25:13,478 --> 01:25:16,137
The lady is not undressing.
She is dressing.

867
01:25:16,138 --> 01:25:18,327
The gentleman happens to be her husband.

868
01:25:18,328 --> 01:25:21,089
They are celebrating
their 27th wedding anniversary.

869
01:25:21,090 --> 01:25:25,261
They are going to have dinner
with their oldest son. He is a taxidermist.

870
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:28,963
I am appalled that you should thus malign
these good people.

871
01:25:28,964 --> 01:25:31,516
It goes to prove
what I have always maintained...

872
01:25:31,517 --> 01:25:34,854
that evil exists
only in the eye of the beholder.

873
01:25:35,167 --> 01:25:38,191
I will thank you
to stop looking at my pictures.

874
01:25:45,177 --> 01:25:46,949
You're right. I am tipsy.

875
01:25:48,096 --> 01:25:50,390
Perhaps if I can wash my face...

876
01:26:02,277 --> 01:26:03,841
How much is it?

877
01:26:07,178 --> 01:26:09,785
- 4,000 francs, <i>monsieur.</i>
- 4,000 francs?

878
01:26:09,889 --> 01:26:12,756
Look here, Lautrec is
still a very young man.

879
01:26:12,758 --> 01:26:14,581
So was Raphael, <i>monsieur.</i>

880
01:26:15,207 --> 01:26:16,562
I'll take it.

881
01:26:16,667 --> 01:26:19,899
Excuse me, <i>monsieur,</i>
I am negotiating for this painting.

882
01:26:20,212 --> 01:26:22,193
Deliver it to my hotel.

883
01:26:25,634 --> 01:26:27,198
Yes, Your Majesty.

884
01:26:48,678 --> 01:26:50,398
I must have slipped off.

885
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:52,743
- I'll go right in.
- It's all over, Henri.

886
01:26:52,744 --> 01:26:54,934
The last of the guests have gone.

887
01:26:56,290 --> 01:26:58,166
Well, in that case...

888
01:26:59,313 --> 01:27:01,295
Including the King of Serbia.

889
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,589
I'm sorry, Maurice...

890
01:27:05,048 --> 01:27:06,820
but don't take it too hard.

891
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:10,627
After all, his forefathers were tending
sheep in the wilds of Bosnia...

892
01:27:10,628 --> 01:27:13,964
- when mine were kings of Navarre.
- You can't go on this way.

893
01:27:13,965 --> 01:27:16,362
- Quite.
- Work or dissipate. You can't do both.

894
01:27:16,363 --> 01:27:19,855
Don't lecture me, Maurice.
If I could be different, I would.

895
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:23,504
I know I drink too much,
but I can't stop myself.

896
01:27:23,817 --> 01:27:26,110
- I wish I could.
- You must stop.

897
01:27:26,111 --> 01:27:29,030
At the rate you're going,
you'll never reach 40.

898
01:27:29,031 --> 01:27:32,263
Neither did Raphael, nor Watteau,
nor Correggio.

899
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,661
I shall be in good company.

900
01:27:34,766 --> 01:27:36,747
Anyway, it's all for the best.

901
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:40,083
Think how my paintings will soar in value.

902
01:27:40,396 --> 01:27:42,586
You stand to benefit hugely.

903
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:45,297
That isn't funny, Henri.

904
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:48,321
No, it isn't.

905
01:27:49,363 --> 01:27:50,928
Forgive me, Maurice.

906
01:27:52,179 --> 01:27:55,307
Now let us get out of here. I need a drink.

907
01:29:25,852 --> 01:29:28,667
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Avril. How ravishing you look.

908
01:29:28,668 --> 01:29:32,942
Isn't he sweet? <i>Monsieur</i> Paquin,
<i>Monsieur</i> Toulouse-Lautrec.

909
01:29:32,943 --> 01:29:34,506
I am honored, <i>monsieur.</i>

910
01:29:34,507 --> 01:29:37,583
Won't you sit down, <i>mademoiselle?</i>
We are all ready for you.

911
01:29:37,584 --> 01:29:39,094
I will call your mannequin.

912
01:29:39,095 --> 01:29:43,630
You've traveled a long road. A few years
ago, you were singing for your supper...

913
01:29:43,631 --> 01:29:46,080
and here you are, a
full-fledged star at 29.

914
01:29:46,081 --> 01:29:49,417
- Twenty-five.
- Of course. I beg your pardon. 25.

915
01:29:49,522 --> 01:29:53,692
I have been 25 for four years,
and I shall stay there another four.

916
01:29:53,693 --> 01:29:56,090
Then I'll be 27 for a while.

917
01:29:56,091 --> 01:29:59,949
- I intend to grow old gracefully.
<i>- Voila, mademoiselle.</i>

918
01:30:00,574 --> 01:30:02,347
Myriame, darling!

919
01:30:02,556 --> 01:30:05,370
Ravishing! But then, what isn't on you?

920
01:30:05,371 --> 01:30:09,333
It isn't fair to your customers
to have her model your things.

921
01:30:09,334 --> 01:30:13,713
Forgive me. <i>Mademoiselle</i> Hayem,
<i>Monsieur</i> Toulouse-Lautrec.

922
01:30:14,025 --> 01:30:17,310
- Well, Henri, what do you think?
- How do you do, <i>mademoiselle?</i>

923
01:30:17,311 --> 01:30:19,655
We've already met, haven't we,
<i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec?

924
01:30:19,656 --> 01:30:23,930
Of course, Henri knows everybody.
Well, Henri, what do you think? Will it do?

925
01:30:23,931 --> 01:30:26,121
If it looks as well on you,
it will do admirably.

926
01:30:26,225 --> 01:30:29,979
Don't talk nonsense. Of course it will.
<i>Au revoir,</i> darling.

927
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:32,376
Don't forget,
you're coming to my opening, Thursday.

928
01:30:32,377 --> 01:30:36,496
Henri will bring you, won't you, darling?
I'll tell him where to pick you up.

929
01:30:36,497 --> 01:30:39,468
- I shall be delighted, <i>mademoiselle.</i>
- I shall be waiting.

930
01:30:39,469 --> 01:30:43,743
<i>Au revoir,</i> Paquin. <i>Au revoir,</i> darling.
Come now, Henri.

931
01:30:47,288 --> 01:30:50,729
She's lovely to look at,
but I'm not sure I approve of Myriame...

932
01:30:50,730 --> 01:30:52,397
if what I hear is true.

933
01:30:52,501 --> 01:30:55,786
They say that she buys her own clothes,
pays her own rent.

934
01:30:55,787 --> 01:30:59,123
What I mean is, there's no telling
where something like that can end.

935
01:30:59,124 --> 01:31:02,199
Men will start getting
the most ridiculous ideas.

936
01:31:02,511 --> 01:31:04,074
I know it for a fact...

937
01:31:04,075 --> 01:31:07,621
that Marcel de la Voisier wanted to
give her one of his thoroughbreds.

938
01:31:07,622 --> 01:31:12,417
I ask you, what is the world coming to
when a girl won't even accept a horse?

939
01:31:25,764 --> 01:31:29,935
<i>I had one fine son.</i>

940
01:31:30,352 --> 01:31:33,375
<i>Born to be a sailor.</i>

941
01:31:33,376 --> 01:31:35,982
<i>Singing.</i>

942
01:31:37,129 --> 01:31:40,986
<i>Wine can leave you pale.</i>

943
01:31:40,987 --> 01:31:46,201
<i>But a man can leave you paler.</i>

944
01:31:46,618 --> 01:31:51,414
<i>Wine can leave you pale.</i>

945
01:31:51,519 --> 01:31:57,462
<i>But a man can leave you paler.</i>

946
01:31:58,922 --> 01:32:02,467
<i>He has his father's eye.</i>

947
01:32:02,571 --> 01:32:06,534
<i>Never was a bluer.</i>

948
01:32:11,330 --> 01:32:15,500
<i>Never walks a maid.</i>

949
01:32:15,501 --> 01:32:18,732
<i>But he is her wooer.</i>

950
01:32:18,733 --> 01:32:21,236
<i>Singing.</i>

951
01:32:22,487 --> 01:32:26,448
<i>Wine can make you true.</i>

952
01:32:26,450 --> 01:32:31,872
<i>But a man can make you truer.</i>

953
01:32:31,976 --> 01:32:36,877
<i>Wine can make you true.</i>

954
01:32:36,981 --> 01:32:43,029
<i>But a man can make you truer</i>

955
01:32:48,034 --> 01:32:49,858
Victor, you do the ordering.

956
01:32:49,859 --> 01:32:53,873
No problem. Caviar, bowls and bowls.
And keep the champagne flowing.

957
01:32:53,874 --> 01:32:55,541
It's enough, isn't it?

958
01:32:56,062 --> 01:32:58,878
I adore generals.
They come right to the point.

959
01:32:58,879 --> 01:33:00,337
I'm surprised at you, Jane.

960
01:33:00,338 --> 01:33:02,943
I thought that
you had given up the military years ago.

961
01:33:02,944 --> 01:33:06,125
Oh, this is different.
I might even marry Victor.

962
01:33:06,126 --> 01:33:07,219
Perish the thought.

963
01:33:07,324 --> 01:33:10,139
Marriage is like a dull meal
with dessert at the beginning.

964
01:33:10,243 --> 01:33:12,328
I have it on the very highest authority.

965
01:33:12,329 --> 01:33:15,769
Pay no attention to him.
He's a cynic. He doesn't believe in love.

966
01:33:15,770 --> 01:33:18,898
Love is a purifying influence...

967
01:33:19,419 --> 01:33:21,817
that ennobles the heart of man.

968
01:33:21,922 --> 01:33:23,329
On the contrary, General...

969
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:26,717
love is a state of confusion
in which the victim cannot distinguish...

970
01:33:26,718 --> 01:33:31,045
between spiritual aspiration,
carnal desire, and pride of ownership.

971
01:33:31,046 --> 01:33:34,746
The wise man satisfies the different
thirsts at different fountains.

972
01:33:34,747 --> 01:33:36,310
And the wise woman?

973
01:33:36,311 --> 01:33:40,585
The wise woman patterns her life on
the theory and practice of modern banking.

974
01:33:40,586 --> 01:33:44,026
She never gives her love,
but only lends it on the best security...

975
01:33:44,027 --> 01:33:46,111
and at the highest rate of interest.

976
01:33:46,113 --> 01:33:49,241
- Don't you agree?
- Tomorrow I'll think of an answer to that.

977
01:33:49,345 --> 01:33:51,534
In the meantime,
I prefer to change the subject.

978
01:33:51,535 --> 01:33:53,829
Come on, Victor, I want to dance.

979
01:33:58,729 --> 01:34:02,900
- Will you dance, <i>mademoiselle?</i>
- No, thank you, not this evening.

980
01:34:03,630 --> 01:34:07,175
I hope that wasn't because of me?
I shan't be lonely.

981
01:34:07,697 --> 01:34:11,033
I enjoyed your exhibition very much,
<i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec.

982
01:34:11,138 --> 01:34:13,222
I have been back three times.

983
01:34:13,223 --> 01:34:17,498
- You are interested in paintings?
- When they have wit and elegance...

984
01:34:17,602 --> 01:34:18,749
and truth.

985
01:34:19,271 --> 01:34:22,920
I am flattered on my account
and sorrowful on yours.

986
01:34:23,233 --> 01:34:24,587
What do you mean?

987
01:34:24,588 --> 01:34:27,352
One should never meet a person
whose work one admires.

988
01:34:27,353 --> 01:34:31,262
What they do is always so much better
than what they are.

989
01:34:31,263 --> 01:34:33,034
Is this true of you?

990
01:34:33,452 --> 01:34:35,224
More than of anyone else.

991
01:34:39,499 --> 01:34:42,210
Do you drink for pleasure,
<i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec?

992
01:34:42,627 --> 01:34:44,086
Is there any other reason?

993
01:34:44,087 --> 01:34:46,902
Many. My father, for instance...

994
01:34:47,528 --> 01:34:49,301
because he sought oblivion.

995
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:53,784
Mercifully, he found it quickly.

996
01:34:55,870 --> 01:35:00,562
- Your father was very fortunate.
- Then do you, too, seek oblivion?

997
01:35:00,771 --> 01:35:03,168
I meant to have
so understanding a daughter.

998
01:35:03,169 --> 01:35:05,776
Myriame, you are incorrigible.

999
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:10,155
The first time you're out with a man, you
tell him your father died of alcoholism.

1000
01:35:10,156 --> 01:35:12,240
Anyway, whose father didn't?

1001
01:35:26,734 --> 01:35:29,497
Good night.
Thank you for a most pleasant evening.

1002
01:35:29,498 --> 01:35:32,208
- Won't you come in?
- Need of sleep brought you home.

1003
01:35:32,209 --> 01:35:35,806
Not really.
And I have something that may interest you.

1004
01:35:36,014 --> 01:35:38,412
Curiosity is my cardinal weakness.

1005
01:35:41,123 --> 01:35:43,105
It's not really an apartment.

1006
01:35:44,147 --> 01:35:46,754
Just one room over the courtyard.

1007
01:35:53,323 --> 01:35:56,660
- Where did you get that?
- Are you surprised?

1008
01:35:58,432 --> 01:36:02,499
- Where did you get it?
- I bought it years ago in the flea market.

1009
01:36:07,295 --> 01:36:08,755
What's the matter?

1010
01:36:09,485 --> 01:36:11,675
- Nothing.
- Who is she?

1011
01:36:12,822 --> 01:36:15,428
Her name is Marie Charlet.

1012
01:36:18,869 --> 01:36:20,538
She owns a pushcart.

1013
01:36:22,206 --> 01:36:23,770
My congratulations.

1014
01:36:23,979 --> 01:36:27,211
If you bought it in the flea market,
you made a good investment.

1015
01:36:27,212 --> 01:36:28,984
It didn't come cheaply.

1016
01:36:29,401 --> 01:36:32,842
The King of Serbia bid 4,000 francs
for his Lautrec.

1017
01:36:33,155 --> 01:36:34,509
Camondo, 6,000 francs.

1018
01:36:34,510 --> 01:36:37,534
But I paid all I had. 2 francs.

1019
01:36:38,681 --> 01:36:41,288
I was an apprentice in a dressmaking shop.

1020
01:36:42,018 --> 01:36:46,710
1 franc a day for 10 hours' work
in a crowded, unventilated room.

1021
01:36:47,440 --> 01:36:51,819
My evenings were spent sewing buttons
on gloves to earn a few extra <i>centimes.</i>

1022
01:36:53,592 --> 01:36:56,303
But having the painting
was more important to me...

1023
01:36:56,304 --> 01:36:58,909
than the suppers
I should have to go without.

1024
01:36:59,014 --> 01:37:00,056
Why?

1025
01:37:01,099 --> 01:37:05,583
Because her eyes told me there were
worse things than cold or hunger.

1026
01:37:05,896 --> 01:37:07,564
Or even loneliness.

1027
01:37:08,711 --> 01:37:11,942
I should think loneliness would be unknown
to a beautiful woman.

1028
01:37:11,943 --> 01:37:15,071
Not when the man you loved is dead,
<i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec.

1029
01:37:17,991 --> 01:37:19,242
Forgive me.

1030
01:37:19,764 --> 01:37:23,674
And the key to all the dreams you shared
lies at the river's bottom?

1031
01:37:23,675 --> 01:37:25,811
He has been dead for five years.

1032
01:37:27,584 --> 01:37:30,921
That key was to another door
in the Avenue du Bois.

1033
01:37:31,963 --> 01:37:36,446
Had the offer included marriage,
I might have opened it.

1034
01:37:36,447 --> 01:37:37,907
But it didn't.

1035
01:37:38,950 --> 01:37:42,078
And not being the wise woman
of your description...

1036
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:46,144
loneliness still seemed to me
the better choice.

1037
01:37:49,481 --> 01:37:53,234
Will you go to the opera
with me tomorrow night, <i>mademoiselle?</i>

1038
01:37:53,235 --> 01:37:56,779
While you decide, let me remind you
of the ladies of the Spanish court...

1039
01:37:56,780 --> 01:38:01,159
who kept pet apes, so that they themselves
would look more beautiful.

1040
01:38:01,263 --> 01:38:05,017
Is your wit always turned against yourself,
<i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec?

1041
01:38:05,434 --> 01:38:09,605
This is to assure you that, in my case,
there will be no advances to repulse.

1042
01:38:09,709 --> 01:38:13,255
I will ask for no more
than an occasional handful of peanuts.

1043
01:38:13,776 --> 01:38:15,653
Until tomorrow, then.

1044
01:38:16,279 --> 01:38:18,051
Good night, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

1045
01:38:23,577 --> 01:38:25,975
Henri, how nice to find you here.

1046
01:38:25,976 --> 01:38:30,042
Good evening, Myriame. I was passing
by and could not resist these.

1047
01:38:31,189 --> 01:38:34,005
- Now that I am here, may I take you home?
- Yes.

1048
01:39:05,807 --> 01:39:06,954
Excuse me.

1049
01:39:14,253 --> 01:39:16,443
Good afternoon, Myriame.

1050
01:39:16,756 --> 01:39:18,424
Good afternoon, Marcel.

1051
01:39:19,467 --> 01:39:22,595
<i>Monsieur</i> de Toulouse-Lautrec.
<i>Monsieur</i> de la Voisier.

1052
01:39:22,803 --> 01:39:24,576
I am honored, <i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec.

1053
01:39:24,993 --> 01:39:27,286
You are the lucky owner of Magnific?

1054
01:39:27,287 --> 01:39:29,371
Congratulations. He's a fine individual.

1055
01:39:29,372 --> 01:39:32,605
- It's all in the breeding.
- Not necessarily.

1056
01:39:32,813 --> 01:39:35,316
- I beg your pardon?
- An idle comment.

1057
01:39:36,046 --> 01:39:39,278
Perhaps one day you'll honor me
by sketching Magnific.

1058
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:42,406
Horses are my next-to-favorite subject.

1059
01:39:43,970 --> 01:39:46,473
I am overwhelmed, <i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec.

1060
01:39:46,994 --> 01:39:48,871
I shall treasure this.

1061
01:39:50,227 --> 01:39:53,668
<i>Au revoir,</i> Myriame. I have missed you.

1062
01:39:55,544 --> 01:39:57,421
Thank you again, <i>monsieur.</i>

1063
01:40:01,488 --> 01:40:02,738
Now that I have seen him...

1064
01:40:02,739 --> 01:40:06,024
I admire even more
your courage in throwing away that key.

1065
01:40:06,025 --> 01:40:08,994
He is as handsome a man
as his horse is a horse.

1066
01:40:08,995 --> 01:40:11,394
Conformation isn't everything, Henri.

1067
01:41:20,525 --> 01:41:23,652
All we know is that a Greek peasant
found her in a cave...

1068
01:41:23,653 --> 01:41:26,782
and sold her to the French government
for 6,000 francs.

1069
01:41:27,511 --> 01:41:30,744
She is so beautiful,
we forget how old she is.

1070
01:41:31,787 --> 01:41:34,080
She is older than Paris itself.

1071
01:41:34,289 --> 01:41:37,417
She was before Christ, before Caesar.

1072
01:41:39,920 --> 01:41:41,379
Until the end of time...

1073
01:41:41,484 --> 01:41:44,820
men will try to penetrate
the mystery of her perfection.

1074
01:41:44,821 --> 01:41:47,010
But it will always elude them.

1075
01:41:52,954 --> 01:41:57,020
It is not true that great art is simple.
Why should it be?

1076
01:41:57,437 --> 01:42:01,087
Life itself is not simple,
nor is the human mind.

1077
01:42:02,442 --> 01:42:05,362
Nor, for that matter, is the human heart.

1078
01:42:12,765 --> 01:42:13,964
Won't you come in?

1079
01:42:13,965 --> 01:42:17,249
Not tonight, Myriame.
I have another engagement.

1080
01:42:17,561 --> 01:42:18,813
Where does one go at this hour?

1081
01:42:18,708 --> 01:42:19,751
Where does one go at this hour?

1082
01:42:19,855 --> 01:42:23,192
Some of the fountains at which I drink
flow ceaselessly.

1083
01:42:26,007 --> 01:42:27,050
Please.

1084
01:42:27,676 --> 01:42:29,240
Good night, Henri.

1085
01:42:46,027 --> 01:42:50,615
On the <i>Bateaux Mouche</i> the only
polite direction in which to look is up...

1086
01:42:50,824 --> 01:42:52,284
at the moon.

1087
01:43:01,877 --> 01:43:05,735
- You're shivering.
- It is cold and I need a drink.

1088
01:43:06,047 --> 01:43:08,862
The first words you ever said to me:

1089
01:43:08,863 --> 01:43:13,242
"The morning wind is cold, but not
so cold as the waters of the Seine."

1090
01:43:13,868 --> 01:43:18,039
- Was that only one month ago, Henri?
- Four weeks and five days.

1091
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,540
I am cursed with such a memory.

1092
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:24,138
It is exactly 11 weeks and 4 days
since I last saw my tailor.

1093
01:43:24,139 --> 01:43:27,475
Two weeks and three days before
I deliver <i>Madame</i> Natanson's portrait.

1094
01:43:27,476 --> 01:43:32,115
My mind is a storehouse of such trivia.
Really important things, I forget instantly.

1095
01:43:33,158 --> 01:43:35,034
The bar is one deck below.

1096
01:43:35,035 --> 01:43:38,580
Henri, tell me about Marie Charlet.

1097
01:43:40,457 --> 01:43:43,898
- What do you want to know?
- Were you in love with her?

1098
01:43:44,211 --> 01:43:48,380
Let us say that she opened doors for me
that might better have remained closed.

1099
01:43:48,381 --> 01:43:51,927
- It's a long time ago.
- And have you never loved since?

1100
01:43:52,969 --> 01:43:57,036
My dear Myriame,
any man can play the fool once, no more.

1101
01:43:57,244 --> 01:43:58,913
Unless he enjoys the role.

1102
01:44:01,728 --> 01:44:04,022
That's how it went.

1103
01:44:05,482 --> 01:44:08,297
And then I toured Spain.

1104
01:44:08,506 --> 01:44:11,425
I can still hear the applause.

1105
01:44:12,781 --> 01:44:15,596
Nobody held a candle to me.

1106
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:19,663
I was the one. Only.

1107
01:44:20,288 --> 01:44:24,042
I danced rings around all the others!

1108
01:44:26,857 --> 01:44:31,028
The musicians got tired...

1109
01:44:31,862 --> 01:44:34,573
before I did.

1110
01:44:36,346 --> 01:44:41,247
I could dance faster than they could play.

1111
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:42,811
Look at that.

1112
01:44:45,209 --> 01:44:49,380
There was no one who could kick like me.

1113
01:44:49,484 --> 01:44:53,342
Once you'd have paid 5 francs to see that.

1114
01:44:53,447 --> 01:44:55,114
You never saw 5 francs.

1115
01:44:55,115 --> 01:44:59,286
You're a liar! I got 50 francs a night.

1116
01:44:59,390 --> 01:45:00,745
Every night.

1117
01:45:01,058 --> 01:45:04,499
I fed my cat better than you eat.

1118
01:45:05,125 --> 01:45:06,793
I was a star.

1119
01:45:07,002 --> 01:45:10,651
People came from all over Paris to see me.

1120
01:45:12,632 --> 01:45:16,073
- In a sideshow.
- You don't believe me...

1121
01:45:16,282 --> 01:45:19,410
any of you. But it's true.

1122
01:45:20,557 --> 01:45:22,017
Yes, it is true.

1123
01:45:22,642 --> 01:45:26,709
I hope you remember me.
We've pledged many a glass in our day.

1124
01:45:29,316 --> 01:45:31,505
The little gentleman...

1125
01:45:33,904 --> 01:45:35,572
with the funny legs.

1126
01:45:35,885 --> 01:45:39,743
- Of course.
- The little gentleman.

1127
01:45:41,515 --> 01:45:45,789
I was the star of the Moulin Rouge!
Wasn't I, <i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec?

1128
01:45:45,791 --> 01:45:48,814
- Yes.
- Tell them I was a star.

1129
01:45:49,753 --> 01:45:51,838
When you made the poster...

1130
01:45:52,464 --> 01:45:55,592
it was La Goulue you put
in the middle of it.

1131
01:45:56,009 --> 01:45:59,137
Who else but the great La Goulue?

1132
01:45:59,450 --> 01:46:01,118
Here, cab.

1133
01:46:06,019 --> 01:46:08,105
What do you think of that?

1134
01:46:09,251 --> 01:46:12,901
Now will you believe me?

1135
01:46:23,224 --> 01:46:24,996
To the hospital in Passy.

1136
01:46:25,309 --> 01:46:27,395
You made her very happy, Henri.

1137
01:46:28,750 --> 01:46:31,461
They say men kill the thing they love most.

1138
01:46:31,774 --> 01:46:34,798
My posters did their part
in destroying the Moulin.

1139
01:46:35,006 --> 01:46:37,717
With great success, it became respectable.

1140
01:46:38,552 --> 01:46:42,201
There was no place for La Goulue,
or any of us.

1141
01:46:49,083 --> 01:46:50,437
1815.

1142
01:46:50,439 --> 01:46:55,496
- I'm appalled at such extravagance.
- One of the joys of being independent...

1143
01:46:55,497 --> 01:46:59,092
is to buy an occasional bottle
for a dissolute friend.

1144
01:46:59,093 --> 01:47:02,117
And long-stemmed hothouse roses
for oneself.

1145
01:47:05,141 --> 01:47:07,956
We'll have to hurry
or we shall miss the first act.

1146
01:47:08,269 --> 01:47:11,606
Would you mind very much
our not going out tonight?

1147
01:47:11,710 --> 01:47:13,170
Just as you please.

1148
01:47:17,549 --> 01:47:20,364
There is something
I want to talk to you about.

1149
01:47:21,824 --> 01:47:22,867
Well?

1150
01:47:25,891 --> 01:47:27,872
The roses are from Marcel.

1151
01:47:30,374 --> 01:47:32,043
I should have guessed.

1152
01:47:32,564 --> 01:47:35,484
He came here last night after you left.

1153
01:47:35,901 --> 01:47:38,403
Did he offer you another brighter key?

1154
01:47:39,342 --> 01:47:41,323
He asked me to marry him.

1155
01:47:41,636 --> 01:47:45,076
So withholding yourself from him
turned the trick.

1156
01:47:45,181 --> 01:47:47,214
Congratulations on a signal victory.

1157
01:47:47,215 --> 01:47:49,299
- Henri!
- Forgive me, my dear.

1158
01:47:49,300 --> 01:47:54,044
I forgot that once accepted, it's vulgar to
suggest marriage isn't arranged in heaven.

1159
01:47:54,045 --> 01:47:57,015
- You're even blinder than I thought.
- On the contrary...

1160
01:47:57,017 --> 01:48:01,708
I saw clearly the other day, that your Marcel
is fighting a losing battle with himself.

1161
01:48:01,709 --> 01:48:04,575
- How do you know I accepted him?
- It stands to reason.

1162
01:48:04,576 --> 01:48:09,215
He is everything that a woman could desire.
Tall, handsome, rich.

1163
01:48:09,216 --> 01:48:12,865
And, thanks to your strategy,
an abject slave to love.

1164
01:48:12,866 --> 01:48:15,314
Do horses bore you, he
will sell his stable.

1165
01:48:15,315 --> 01:48:17,661
Do you like a moustache, he will grow one.

1166
01:48:17,662 --> 01:48:19,903
Will you change your mind,
he will shave it off.

1167
01:48:19,904 --> 01:48:21,154
Stop, Henri!

1168
01:48:21,258 --> 01:48:24,073
Forgive me again.
I was merely rejoicing for you.

1169
01:48:24,074 --> 01:48:25,950
I haven't given him my answer.

1170
01:48:25,951 --> 01:48:28,349
Excellent! Keep him on the rack longer.

1171
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:30,851
He deserves it for being so tardy.

1172
01:48:31,164 --> 01:48:32,520
Thank you, Henri.

1173
01:48:34,188 --> 01:48:36,690
You have told me what I wanted to know.

1174
01:48:36,691 --> 01:48:38,255
And what is that?

1175
01:48:39,089 --> 01:48:41,487
That you are not in love with me.

1176
01:48:44,407 --> 01:48:47,013
- Did I ever act as though I were?
- No.

1177
01:48:49,829 --> 01:48:53,635
I am moved by your concern for my feelings,
but it is quite without cause.

1178
01:48:53,636 --> 01:48:57,388
And now that I have set your mind at rest,
I think I shall go to the play.

1179
01:48:57,389 --> 01:48:59,838
So please give your devoted monkey
his hat.

1180
01:48:59,839 --> 01:49:01,924
Don't call yourself that!

1181
01:49:16,314 --> 01:49:17,773
Good night, Myriame.

1182
01:49:20,797 --> 01:49:23,821
Will you be outside Paquin's tomorrow?

1183
01:49:24,030 --> 01:49:26,323
You can count on me to
perform faithfully...

1184
01:49:26,324 --> 01:49:29,764
as long as it pleases you
to keep Marcel in torment.

1185
01:50:29,303 --> 01:50:30,762
<i>- Monsieur</i> Lautrec?
- Yes.

1186
01:50:30,763 --> 01:50:33,057
- From <i>Mademoiselle</i> Hayem.
- Thank you.

1187
01:50:36,915 --> 01:50:40,877
<i>"Dearest Henri, Marie Charlet</i>
<i>has worked her evil on us both.</i>

1188
01:50:41,086 --> 01:50:44,996
<i>"I have tried to win your love,</i>
<i>but know now it is hopeless.</i>

1189
01:50:44,997 --> 01:50:47,238
<i>"I cannot endure things as they are.</i>

1190
01:50:47,239 --> 01:50:48,906
<i>"I am marrying Marcel.</i>

1191
01:50:49,219 --> 01:50:52,139
<i>"He knows I do not love
him, but is content.</i>

1192
01:50:52,347 --> 01:50:53,494
"Adieu, <i>Henri."</i>

1193
01:50:53,703 --> 01:50:54,849
Driver.

1194
01:50:54,850 --> 01:50:56,621
Myriame, where are you?

1195
01:50:56,622 --> 01:50:57,583
Myriame, where are you?

1196
01:50:57,873 --> 01:51:00,375
- Are you there?
- What do you want, <i>monsieur?</i>

1197
01:51:00,376 --> 01:51:02,252
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Hayem. Where is she?

1198
01:51:02,253 --> 01:51:05,277
She gave up the room, <i>monsieur.</i>
She left no address.

1199
01:51:21,334 --> 01:51:24,044
Bring me more absinthe
and be quick about it.

1200
01:51:24,045 --> 01:51:26,443
Now, <i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec, you've had enough.

1201
01:51:26,444 --> 01:51:28,633
Besides it's time I closed up.

1202
01:51:28,842 --> 01:51:30,197
You insolent lout.

1203
01:51:31,136 --> 01:51:32,387
Don't argue with me.

1204
01:51:32,491 --> 01:51:36,662
Bring me more absinthe,
or I will break everything in this...

1205
01:51:40,416 --> 01:51:43,127
He'll fall and break his neck some day.

1206
01:51:44,587 --> 01:51:48,862
This is the last one, <i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec.
I close in five minutes.

1207
01:51:49,800 --> 01:51:52,407
Thank you, Victor. You're a good man.

1208
01:51:53,450 --> 01:51:55,118
You are my friend.

1209
01:52:03,251 --> 01:52:05,857
For a year I've told him
to take his trade elsewhere.

1210
01:52:05,858 --> 01:52:07,734
But, no, he keeps on coming back.

1211
01:52:07,735 --> 01:52:11,906
Can I do anything about it?
Not unless I want Patou down my neck.

1212
01:52:12,010 --> 01:52:14,773
I'd throw him out in a minute
if it wasn't for Patou.

1213
01:52:14,774 --> 01:52:16,805
He's told every bistro owner in Montmartre:

1214
01:52:16,807 --> 01:52:19,725
"If anything happens to him,
I'll put the screws on you."

1215
01:52:19,726 --> 01:52:22,124
Nobody wants trouble with the police.

1216
01:52:22,333 --> 01:52:25,982
Look at him.
Reading the same letter over and over.

1217
01:52:26,817 --> 01:52:29,527
You'd think that after a year
he'd know what's in it.

1218
01:52:29,528 --> 01:52:33,072
But, no, he keeps on reading it.
It gets on a man's nerves.

1219
01:52:33,073 --> 01:52:36,827
- Victor, get me a drink.
- There's no more absinthe.

1220
01:52:37,869 --> 01:52:39,538
I didn't ask for absinthe.

1221
01:52:40,059 --> 01:52:41,727
Here, give me a glass.

1222
01:52:46,628 --> 01:52:48,296
Your health, Victor.

1223
01:52:56,534 --> 01:52:58,305
Take him out of here, Inspector.

1224
01:52:58,306 --> 01:53:01,591
I don't care if you close my bistro,
I don't want him in it.

1225
01:53:01,592 --> 01:53:04,562
He'll kill himself,
and I don't want it to happen here.

1226
01:53:04,563 --> 01:53:06,179
It gives a place a bad name.

1227
01:53:06,180 --> 01:53:08,732
- Time to go home.
- Take your hands off me.

1228
01:53:08,733 --> 01:53:12,487
- How dare you...
- Come on. Be sensible, <i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec.

1229
01:53:12,696 --> 01:53:15,720
- It's time to go home.
- It's you, Patou.

1230
01:53:16,762 --> 01:53:20,568
We're old friends, Patou and I.
You didn't know that, did you, Victor?

1231
01:53:20,569 --> 01:53:22,913
Come on, let's get out of this rat's nest.

1232
01:53:22,914 --> 01:53:25,833
Let's go somewhere, just you and I,
and have a drink.

1233
01:53:25,834 --> 01:53:30,057
- By all means, <i>Monsieur</i> Lautrec.
- You think you're fooling me, don't you?

1234
01:53:30,058 --> 01:53:33,811
You say you'll have a drink,
but you really mean to take me home.

1235
01:53:33,812 --> 01:53:35,426
What are you doing here anyhow?

1236
01:53:35,427 --> 01:53:38,086
Always putting your nose
in other people's business.

1237
01:53:38,087 --> 01:53:40,118
Why don't you stop pestering me?

1238
01:53:40,119 --> 01:53:43,351
I'm a citizen.
Have you a warrant for my arrest?

1239
01:54:00,869 --> 01:54:03,163
It's a mystery how he can go on.

1240
01:54:04,206 --> 01:54:05,561
He still works.

1241
01:54:05,978 --> 01:54:10,358
He drags himself to his easel and paints
in spite of all.

1242
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:18,282
He is sleeping soundly enough now.

1243
01:54:19,221 --> 01:54:22,349
Nothing will wake him, not for hours.

1244
01:54:32,776 --> 01:54:36,216
I must report to the prefecture
that he needs medical attention.

1245
01:54:36,217 --> 01:54:39,553
He must go to a hospital.
They'll know what to do.

1246
01:54:39,658 --> 01:54:43,932
They'll give him things to make him sleep,
and they'll keep him away from the bottle.

1247
01:54:43,933 --> 01:54:45,287
Wait till tomorrow.

1248
01:54:45,288 --> 01:54:48,834
Then if he's not any better,
I will send for his mother.

1249
01:54:50,710 --> 01:54:52,692
<i>Madame</i> Loubet!

1250
01:54:52,796 --> 01:54:54,256
Where are you? They're back, the roaches!
Millions of them!

1251
01:54:54,151 --> 01:54:56,654
Where are you? They're back, the roaches!
Millions of them!

1252
01:55:26,997 --> 01:55:28,039
Amen.

1253
01:56:01,927 --> 01:56:03,909
His eyes are open.

1254
01:56:14,961 --> 01:56:16,734
Can you hear me, Henri?

1255
01:56:17,047 --> 01:56:20,071
Listen, this is from Maurice Joyant.

1256
01:56:21,739 --> 01:56:22,990
Listen.

1257
01:56:24,971 --> 01:56:27,578
"The Louvre has accepted
Camondo Collection."

1258
01:56:27,787 --> 01:56:30,393
This makes you only artist
to be so honored in his lifetime.

1259
01:56:30,289 --> 01:56:32,750
This makes you only artist
to be so honored in his lifetime.

1260
01:56:33,522 --> 01:56:35,190
Do you hear me, Henri?

1261
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:38,422
Your paintings are to hang in the Louvre.

1262
01:56:39,569 --> 01:56:41,342
I didn't understand.

1263
01:56:41,759 --> 01:56:43,219
Forgive me, Henri.

1264
01:56:43,844 --> 01:56:45,408
I didn't understand.

1265
01:57:50,056 --> 01:57:52,298
<i>Henri, my dear,</i>
<i>we just heard you were dying.</i>

1266
01:57:52,299 --> 01:57:54,175
<i>We simply had to say goodbye.</i>

1267
01:57:54,176 --> 01:57:57,250
<i>It was divine knowing you.</i>
<i>We will see you later, of course.</i>

1268
01:57:57,251 --> 01:57:59,753
<i>But now, if you forgive me, I must fly.</i>

1269
01:57:59,754 --> 01:58:03,194
<i>There is the most beautiful creature</i>
<i>waiting for me at Maxim's.</i>

1270
01:58:03,195 --> 01:58:05,176
<i>Goodbye, Henri.</i>
