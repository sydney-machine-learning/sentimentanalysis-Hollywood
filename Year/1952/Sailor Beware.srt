00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,113
- Well, Jim, they look pretty good, huh?
- Certainly do, Chief.

3
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,596
If it does, it'll be a miracle.

4
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,551
Hey, how long we gotta
stand in line, sailor?

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,309
- Sailor?
- Oh, you're the doorman?

6
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,034
Have you ever considered
any other branch of the service?

7
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,118
The Army recruiting office is
just down the street, you know.

8
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,118
Oh, thanks gobs, gob,
but I gotta get in the Navy.

9
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,356
It's practically doctor's orders,
practically.

10
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,549
Doctor's orders?

11
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,275
Oh, yes, sir. You see, it's my allergies,
and my doctor says I need ocean travel,

12
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,391
and this is the only way I can afford it.

13
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,158
Do you know anyone in there?

14
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,477
The chief of this station and I are
as close as that.

15
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,230
Oh. Then maybe you can
do me a favour, sir.

16
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,794
You see, I'm a little bit worried
about passing a physical,

17
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,751
and I thought maybe
you could get the chief in there

18
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,233
to put in a good word for me.

19
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,679
Well, you can depend on that.

20
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,997
I'll see that the chief tells them
all about you.

21
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,913
Oh, thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.

22
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,395
Gee, I hope he don't forget
to tell the chief about me.

23
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,796
Hey, buddy, I can't watch you go down
for the third time.

24
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,434
Be my guest?
http://www.divx-titlovi.com

25
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,357
Oh, you want I should change places
with her?

26
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,515
No!

27
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,710
You don't have to get mad.
I was just asking.

28
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,037
Now, look, honey,
we can't hold up the Navy.

29
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,798
Oh, Al, doll!

30
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,474
That'll hold you for four years.
Goodbye, sugar.

31
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,794
Goodbye.

32
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,513
Goodbye, Al.

33
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,476
- Wasrt that...
- Hetty Button.

34
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,837
You know, if I could kiss a girl like that,
I wouldn't have to join the Navy.

35
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,030
Oh, cheer up, Atlas,
I'm only going through the motions.

36
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,469
I go in one door and come out the other.
They won't have me.

37
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,478
- How do you know?
- This is the 11th time I've tried to enlist.

38
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,591
They keep rejecting me.
I have a trick knee.

39
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,551
But these goodbyes
sure make it won'thwhile.

40
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,990
You mean after 11 times
she hasn't caught on?

41
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,189
That's the 11th girl.

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,070
Gee, you're lucky.
I can't even get close to a girl.

43
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,395
I'm allergic to face powder,
perfume and lipstick.

44
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,114
If I get too close to a girl,
my uvula becomes oedematous,

45
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,708
which means inflamed,
and if it becomes inflamed, it swells up.

46
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,875
Then I can't breathe.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,309
And if I can't breathe,
that could become fatal.

48
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:13,159
- You said a mouthful.
- Do you know women could kill me?

49
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,474
What a way to die.

50
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,910
Although I could dose myself with
privine, pyrobenzamine and Benadryl,

51
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,268
then breathing would be possible

52
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,277
but so expensive
I'd probably starve to death.

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,389
Yeah, what's the difference?

54
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,478
If you can't go out with any women,
you might as well be dead anyhow.

55
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,114
I got it. Why don't you go out
with a lot of women,

56
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,117
kiss them and build up an immunity?

57
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,357
I can't even get close to a girl.
I've never been kissed.

58
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,152
Even my mother wouldn't have
the nerve.

59
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,349
Well, that figures.

60
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,993
All right, come on, let's close up.

61
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,638
The old man is still as bad as ever.

62
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,438
Where do you think you're going?

63
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,391
I was just... Nowhere.

64
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,750
- What's it to you?
- Get back where you belong.

65
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,836
Don't let that fathead
talk to you like that.

66
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,188
Who's calling me a fathead?

67
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,038
My friend has a right to his own opinion.

68
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,149
Is that your opinion?

69
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,236
I'll say it is. He thinks you're a stupid ox.

70
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,075
- Now I'm a stupid ox, huh?
- I didn't say anything.

71
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,430
Don't back down.
Tell him you'll punch him in the nose.

72
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,630
Stop putting words in my mouth.
I won't say that.

73
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,433
- You won't say what?
- "I'll punch you in the nose."

74
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,039
- Oh, I said it.
- Why, you...

75
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,956
He broke the whole chest. Now my ribs
are busted, they're all smashed.

76
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,115
Come on.

77
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,508
Hey, do you see that?
That little guy down the line?

78
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,834
- Yeah, Chief.
- Well, naturally, I don't want to interfere

79
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,030
and I don't want any leniency shown,

80
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,278
but I do want to make certain
that this guy is really physically fit

81
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,833
for the Navy.
http://www.divx-titlovi.com

82
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,234
Okay, Chief.

83
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,709
The squirt down the line is
a friend of the chief's. Pass it on.

84
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,230
The weird one's a friend of the chief.

85
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,918
Wouldrt you know?

86
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,075
See that squirrelly character
down there?

87
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,349
A friend of the chief's.

88
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,832
Hey, they're all staring at me.

89
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,429
Stare back at them.

90
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,830
Well, let's face it,
you are a little different.

91
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,157
Fill these out. Go over in the corner
and strip. Make it snappy.

92
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,352
Fill these out. Go over in the corner
and strip. Move along.

93
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,158
Here are some papers
that we have to have filled out.

94
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,430
We hope it won't be too much trouble.

95
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,269
Then after that, would you mind going
over in the corner and disrobing?

96
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,032
I don't even know you.

97
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,954
Well, all of the other fellows are.
Wouldrt you?

98
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,108
Okay.

99
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,109
In your mouth.

100
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,639
Open up. Open up.

101
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,239
What's your surname?

102
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,314
You talk backwards.
You mean, "What's my name, sir?"

103
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,919
I said surname.

104
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,393
- Sir?
- Yes.

105
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,308
Yes, what?

106
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,834
Yes, sir.

107
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,076
Oh, you don't have to talk so polite
to me. No one ever does.

108
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,189
You can call me Melvin.

109
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,429
Melvin?

110
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,869
Melvin Jones.

111
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,189
Have you ever had erysipelas,
appendicitis, mumps, whooping cough,

112
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,550
eye, ear, nose or throat trouble,
hay fever?

113
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,035
Any illness
other than those already noted?

114
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,149
That's all.

115
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,476
Hey! Where's my thermometer?

116
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,232
That was a thermometer?
I thought it was a peppermint stick.

117
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,631
- Roger. Over and out.
- Quiet!

118
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,272
Did you lose something?

119
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,550
No, but I think you did.
Where's your heart?

120
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,874
You're the doctor.

121
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,715
Yes.

122
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,752
Be a good little boy now
and tell the doctor where your heart is.

123
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,552
You find it. I'm no stool pigeon.

124
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,595
You're cold.

125
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,597
Cold. Getting warmer.

126
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,869
Here, I'll help you.

127
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,950
I don't like to worry you, son, but did you
ever think of taking it easier?

128
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,115
You know, a thing...

129
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,399
There must be one someplace.

130
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,234
Finally found it. Running like a watch.

131
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,954
Gee, I wish they'd tell us if we passed.

132
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,998
Say, before they do,
I'd like to get something off my chest.

133
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,509
Fellas, in the 11 times
that I've tried to enlist,

134
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,437
I've never met a nicer bunch of men.

135
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,834
That goes for me, too.

136
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,951
Thanks to you, Al. Best of luck to youse.

137
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,593
I'm really sorry to have to leave,

138
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,359
except for you.

139
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,115
And I can say in all my Navy experience,
I've never met a bigger fathead.

140
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,275
Why you, I...

141
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,630
Lardoski, recruiting officer wants
to see you.

142
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,749
Right, Chief.

143
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,269
- Crowthers?
- Well, this is it, fellas.

144
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,389
Yeah?

145
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,511
Congratulations.
I've got good news for you.

146
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,916
They lowered the physical requirements
in the past two weeks. You're in now.

147
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,993
In fact, you all made it.

148
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,793
They can't do this to me.

149
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,070
Why don't you write a letter
to your congressman?

150
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,474
What good will that do?

151
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,989
No good, but you'll have a pen pal.

152
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,996
Lardoski, when we find someone
in a group of recruits

153
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,350
who has the qualities of leadership,
we put him in charge.

154
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,276
As a veteran
who has decided to re-enlist,

155
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,833
you'll get your old rating back.

156
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,190
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh, yes. Here are the records.

157
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,913
It's guys like that fathead Lardoski

158
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,395
that must've caused the physical
requirements to be lowered.

159
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,829
Yeah, and I bet the Navy will get
those brainy guys

160
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,518
to boss around the fatheads.

161
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,993
Boy, I'm gonna work real hard, too,

162
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,473
and I'm gonna try
and get a commission.

163
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,990
And if I ever become a private,
will I boss that Lardoski around.

164
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,269
Oh, no, I will.

165
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,756
I'll walk right up to him,
I'll say, "You're a fathead."

166
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,634
And I'd say,
"You're a stupid ox and you're..."

167
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,995
You're here!

168
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,475
Petty Officer Lardoski will take charge
of this group.

169
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,794
You will take your orders from him.

170
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,199
Remember, men,
you're in the Navy now.

171
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,788
Okay, men, two ranks through this door,

172
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,195
and I don't want no goldbricking.

173
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,232
Excuse me, handsome.

174
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,112
Where do you get
that "handsome" stuff?

175
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,231
Didrt I hear the man call you
a pretty officer?

176
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,237
He said, "Petty officer."

177
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,993
Okay, look alive, now.
Get going. Keep moving.

178
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,599
What's the matter?

179
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,359
I'm seasick already.

180
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,754
Oh, come here.

181
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,313
Oh, boys.

182
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:53,875
Boys!

183
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,832
Come on. Come on.

184
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,077
Pardon me, gentlemen,
but you are keeping the Navy waiting.

185
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,350
If you will kindly pass through the gates,

186
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,914
we'll try to make your life
comfortable and cosy.

187
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,953
Come up and see us sometime.

188
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,513
Get going, you dumb clucks!

189
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,835
On the double. You're in the Navy now!

190
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,915
Step up. Right up here.

191
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,309
You're done.

192
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,718
- Hey, give me that.
- Don't yell. I'm nervous.

193
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,590
- What do they want me here for?
- They want a sample of your blood.

194
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,948
Who's giving samples?

195
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,469
Blood isn't dress goods.
You say, "Snip off a swatch."

196
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,511
You wanna see if it matches
the living room drapes.

197
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,675
Don't get excited.

198
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,439
Well, blood isn't orange juice.
What do they wanna do, sample it?

199
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,676
And if they like it,
come back tomorrow for two quarts?

200
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,279
They want a sample so they can type it.

201
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,558
They're not gonna type with my blood.

202
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,952
Let them use a typewriter ribbon.

203
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,991
- Ma!
- Hey, Melvin!

204
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,839
- Ma!
- Hey, get back in line there.

205
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,119
Do you have an appointment?

206
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,678
Would you mind waiting just a minute?

207
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,191
What's the matter?
Arert you housebroken?

208
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,591
Hey, you don't use makeup, do you?

209
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,552
No, just a little lipstick.

210
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,196
Oh, I'm glad. What's your name?

211
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,594
Hilda Jones.

212
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,472
That's a coincidence. That's my name.

213
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,239
- Hilda?
- No, Jones. Melvin Jones.

214
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,157
- Where were you born?
- I don't know.

215
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,997
You don't know where you were born?

216
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,076
Oh, I thought you asked me
why was I born.

217
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,153
I was born in a bed, I think.

218
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,349
Don't you know?

219
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,310
How would I know?
I was just a little baby at the time.

220
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,558
Oh, come on, we're wasting time.

221
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,276
- Have you been to the bank before?
- Three times.

222
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,480
- Three times?
- I wanted to get a loan.

223
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,238
You wanted to borrow from the bank?

224
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,518
Well, I was a little short at the time.

225
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,073
I'd have paid it back
in a couple of months.

226
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,633
You should be ashamed of yourself,

227
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,716
trying to borrow blood
when it's so badly needed.

228
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,875
- Blood?
- Yes.

229
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,752
Everyone should donate
to the blood bank.

230
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,677
- What type are you?
- Oh, the quiet type.

231
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,552
I go to bed at 9:00,
see a movie now and then,

232
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,954
read some books, play checkers.

233
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,117
No, I mean,
what kind of blood have you?

234
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,954
- Red.
- Oh, come on, we're wasting time.

235
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,913
I'll turn you over to the Red Cross nurse,
and she'll give you your orange juice.

236
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,075
- Orange juice?
- Yeah.

237
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,873
She'll give you a glass of orange juice,
and you give her a pint of blood.

238
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,115
Oh, that sounds like a fair exchange.

239
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,151
She gives me a glass of orange juice
and I give her...

240
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,509
A pint?

241
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,315
I haven't got any more samples, fellas.

242
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,590
I just gave it all away.

243
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,637
I'm scared. No, I'm scared.
Oh, come on, fellas.

244
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,152
- You still here?
- Yeah.

245
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,590
Did you expect me to be back
at my old job, singing in a nightclub?

246
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,711
Meet my agent. He gets 10% .

247
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,918
That's all for you.

248
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,717
All right, let's go. You're next.

249
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,989
Come on. Come on.

250
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,429
Come on, Melvin, this won't hurt you.
Go ahead.

251
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,913
- It won't hurt?
- It won't hurt.

252
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,798
- It won't hurt.
- No.

253
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,871
- What have you been doing?
- I've been to the blood bank.

254
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,797
Looks like your account's overdrawn.

255
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,992
Could I get fired for this?

256
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,680
No, but if you should see birds
following your ship,

257
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,917
don't bet they're seagulls, brother.
They're vultures.

258
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,917
Let me try that other arm.

259
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,993
You sure you're living?

260
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,519
Am I sure I'm living?

261
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,040
I don't know.

262
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,992
Made a hole in the wrong place.

263
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,917
I missed the hole, too.

264
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,713
- What's par for this course?
- All right, all right.

265
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,274
It don't have to be blood.
I'll take anything.

266
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,598
Let's turn him upside down.
Maybe it runs the other way.

267
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,431
Well, might as well give up, fellas.

268
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,233
We'll get blood if we have to dig all day.

269
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,997
What're you doing, patching a tyre?

270
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,588
I never had so many needles stuck
in me in my whole life.

271
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,280
- Oh, I don't feel good.
- Oh, I'll get some water.

272
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,630
- You'll be all right.
- But I don't feel good.

273
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,955
- Oh, brace up now.
- I'm dizzy.

274
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,911
- No, you're all right.
- I'm all right.

275
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,234
Here, drink this.

276
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,199
I feel much better now.
Thank you very much.

277
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,399
I'm leaking. Oh, I'm leaking.

278
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,037
Oh, no! Oh, no! No, not that.

279
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,230
Oh, no! No, not that.

280
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,354
I never touched him.

281
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,669
All right, men, this is your new home.

282
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,756
Grab any bunk
and stow away your gear.

283
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,154
Hey, you, tuck in your skivvy shirt.

284
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,558
Well, what's that for?

285
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,797
This is my money belt, so I can save
all the money I earn in the Navy.

286
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,909
For what?

287
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,554
So I can study electronics
when I'm through with my enlistment.

288
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:44,399
I'm not gonna be foolish with my money
and gamble and drink it away.

289
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,078
Besides, I can't go out with girls.

290
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,111
Well, all right, come on.
Let's look for our bunks,

291
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,231
because the only thing
you'll be able to do around here

292
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,669
- in your spare time is sleep.
- Oh, here's a couple.

293
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,633
Okay, you take the top. Go ahead.
Throw the bag up there.

294
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,354
Hey, what...

295
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,999
Why, you... Let me up out of here.

296
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,915
- I ought to...
- All right, now, take it easy, Chief.

297
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,155
He didn't mean to. He slipped.

298
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,989
I'll take care of you later, Jones.

299
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,109
Come on, Melvin.

300
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,557
Why do I always get in trouble?

301
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,150
You know,
I thought you were gonna be my friend,

302
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,872
someone I could look up to,

303
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,352
someone to be real close to me.

304
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,310
Someone who'd stick by me
through thick or thin.

305
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,833
Now you think I'm stupid.

306
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,392
Don't cry, Melvin.
I don't think you're stupid.

307
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,909
That's funny. Everyone else does.

308
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,959
- Hey, Al?
- Yeah?

309
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,634
Do you think I'll ever get
to look like a sailor?

310
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,478
Sure. Why, in eight weeks
I won't know you from Admiral Halsey.

311
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,996
Arms out. Two- count exercise.
Keep your arms straight, your head up.

312
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,712
Keep your arms straight. Ready?

313
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,079
Begin! One, two, one, two.

314
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,159
- Up, down, up, down.
- One, two, one, two,

315
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,432

316
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:15,314
one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two.

317
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,237
One, two and two.

318
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,113
Feet apart with a jump, arms sideward.
Place.

319
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,555
A four-count exercise
beginning with the left hand.

320
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,955
Four-count exercise
beginning with the left hand. Ready?

321
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,275
- Begin.
- Begin!

322
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,628
One, two,

323
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,954
three, four.

324
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,399
- One, two.
- Left up.

325
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,839
- Three, four.
- Right up.

326
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,428
Left up, right up.

327
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,835
A one, two and four.

328
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,713
Feet together with jump,
arms downward. Sink.

329
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,791
Arms sideward and upward.

330
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,149
Raise!

331
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,077
Ready? Begin!

332
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,953
One, two, down, up.

333
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,472
Down, up, a one, two.

334
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,633
Down, up, a one, two.

335
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,311
A one, two, one, two, one, two.

336
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,996
Down, up, down, up.

337
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:08,591
One, two, one, two, one, two.

338
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,952
Down. Up. Two and halt.

339
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,192
Palms together, turn,
arms sideward and downward. Sink.

340
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,117
Feet apart with a jump and neck.

341
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,869
- Fast.
- Fast.

342
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,639
Begin!

343
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,309
...two, three, four.
A one, two, three, four.

344
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,228
A one, two, three, four.
A one, two, three, four.

345
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,035
A one, two, three, four.
A one, two, three, four.

346
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,038
A one, two, three, four. A one, two.

347
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,233
Feet together with a jump,
arms downward. Sink.

348
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,677
Break rank, fall out
and get your clothes!

349
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,234
Break ranks!
Fall out, get your clothes! Dismissed!

350
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,512
All right, men, this is the procedure
for lowering a boat.

351
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,473
Muster crew,
remove cover and strongback.

352
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,636
See that the automatic plug is free.

353
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,069
Have painter forward outside of davits.

354
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,909
Let go all gripes and boat chocks.
Remove reel covers,

355
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,952
raise boat clear of chocks,
belay the falls,

356
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,672
slack davit, guys, and...

357
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,797
Jones, repeat what I just said.

358
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,633
Word for word?

359
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,318
Every if, and, and but?

360
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,793
Start talking!

361
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,676
Muster crew,
remove cover and strongbacks.

362
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,349
Be sure the automatic plug is free.

363
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,752
Have painter forward
outboard of davits.

364
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,350
Let go of gripes and boat chocks,
remove reel cover.

365
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,277
Raise boat to clear chocks.

366
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,789
Belay the falls and slack davit, guys.

367
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,959
Stroke!

368
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,953
One, two, stroke!

369
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,118
That's it, men. Put your backs into it.

370
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,159
Stroke!

371
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,710
- Watch the head.
- Stroke.

372
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,717
Come on, I said, watch the head!

373
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,717
- Get it out of the way.
- Stroke.

374
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,879
You missed.

375
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,235
Stroke.

376
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,029
Jones.

377
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,310
Get the water out of that boat.

378
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,073
Aye, aye, sir.

379
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,635
Stroke.

380
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,395
Stroke.

381
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,557
Get the water out of the boat!
Get the water out of the boat!

382
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,430
Jones, I said,
get the water out of the boat!

383
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,553
Get the water out of the boat.
Get the water out of the boat.

384
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,875
One.

385
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,315
Two.

386
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,749
Stroke.

387
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,278
Put that plug back!

388
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,193
Aye, aye, sir.

389
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,039
- Jones, get the water out of that boat.
- Aye, aye, sir.

390
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,150
- Get the water out of the boat!
- Aye, aye, sir.

391
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,318
- Out of the boat.
- Aye, aye, sir.

392
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,112
Get the water...

393
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,199
At this point in your training,
you guys could figure on a big liberty,

394
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,515
but it don't look like
we're gonna get one on account

395
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,393
of the way a certain bluejacket
has been acting up.

396
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,952
What's this "certain bluejacket" stuff?
You afraid to mention his name?

397
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,753
No, I ain't. If the shoe fits, put it on.

398
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,430
There's no basis for metabolism.

399
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,393
Certainly I'm aware of the fact that
there are other men concerned here,

400
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,795
and you still can't feel that
a physical being is abstract.

401
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,718
You've got to base the full heart
and soul on the ingredient

402
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:58,276
that other people are aware of the fact
that physical being isn't even involved.

403
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,119
- Isn't that right?
- Why, you stupid, little...

404
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,198
- Which one of you guys is Crowthers?
- Here, sir.

405
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,350
Special Service would like you to sing
on the Tempting Kiss TV show today.

406
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,879
I've arranged for your liberty.

407
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,958
Thank you, sir, but I don't think it's fair
that I should take liberty

408
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,274
just because I can sing a song,

409
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,799
and the rest of the fellows
have to stay here

410
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,833
because a certain chief enjoys
taking liberty from a certain bluejacket.

411
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,313
All right, Crowthers.

412
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,351
Lardoski, give all of these men liberty,

413
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,198
if they can be ready in a half an hour.

414
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,870
- Are you on liberty, too?
- Uh-huh.

415
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,153
Gee, Hilda, I'm glad I met you.

416
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,069
- You know, I just thought of something?
- What?

417
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,509
What would happen if I get a call
to return to the base,

418
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,428
pack my equipment, board the ship, and
they sent me to Alaska or someplace?

419
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,312
I wouldn't forget you.

420
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,353
Well, I'll see that you don't.
Stick out your hand.

421
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,039
- Hey, you tied a square knot.
- I did?

422
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,551
I didn't even know I could do it.

423
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,350
Would you go into town with me?

424
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,273
You know, you're the first girl I ever met
that I'm not allergic to.

425
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,311
Well, that'll keep you away
from the rest of the girls, won't it?

426
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,475
Uh-huh.

427
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,556
We better hurry.
I want you to hear Al sing.

428
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,636
What is this Tempting Kiss Lipstick?

429
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,671
Oh, that's the kind I use.
It doesn't smear or rub off.

430
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,835
You want to test it?

431
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,428
Here in the street, in front of everyone?
No!

432
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,999
Okay, test it.

433
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,237
- You're right, nothing happened.
- I'll say nothing happened.

434
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,157
Come on, we'll be late.

435
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,352
- Come on.
- All right.

436
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,199
Oh, here we are.

437
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,075
- Where are we going?
- Right here.

438
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,872
A television station?

439
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,629
They got a cathode tube and
a master oscillator that just won't quit.

440
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,909
Come on.

441
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,033
Thank you. Thank you.

442
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,391
Well, how are
all my kissable girls today?

443
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,078
Fine, Mr Chubby.

444
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,031
We have a lot of fun here, don't we?

445
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,788
Yes, sir.

446
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:32,595
And today, today we're going to select
the most kissable girl in San Diego.

447
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,199
Now, what do you think of that, huh?

448
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,635
And the winner will receive
a Hellman mink coat,

449
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,399
a complete set
of Chapman bicycle tyres,

450
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,873
an Ellington grease gun,

451
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,514
a 10-year supply
of Go Gettum Dog Food,

452
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,517
four Donavan wristwatches,

453
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,871
10 glorious days
at the Palm Garden Hotel in Honolulu

454
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,516
and a complete wardrobe by Edythe
for the lucky girl who gets the trip.

455
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,991
There's our sailor now.

456
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,714
- We've been waiting for you.
- Who, me? What did I do?

457
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,434
- Will you come up here, please?
- Oh, yeah.

458
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,596
Isn't he handsome, girls?

459
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,477
This is my pal, Al Crowthers. He's
supposed to sing on your programme.

460
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,398
Here's our first guest, ladies,
Al Crowthers.

461
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,278
Take it away, Al. You'll accompany him?

462
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,994
- Oh, yeah. Where are we going, Al?
- We're not going anywhere, Melvin.

463
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,395
- He wants you to help me with my song.
- Oh, well, how?

464
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,114
I don't know. We haven't got
an orchestra. I don't know what to do.

465
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,196
- You want I should hum?
- No, no.

466
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,548
Got any other ideas?

467
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,838
Yeah, I have an idea.

468
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,111
- Oh, good. Go ahead, bring them up.
- Come on up, fellas.

469
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,031
Yeah, you play the piano, Fred.

470
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,029
Melvin.

471
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,156
I'll be too old to sing this number.

472
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,879
Now, hurry up.

473
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,953
Today

474
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,514
Tomorrow

475
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,509
Forever

476
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,795
You are the one girl I love

477
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,155
Today

478
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,074
Tomorrow

479
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,155
Forever

480
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,031
As long as stars shine above

481
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,593
The stars that shine
The stars that shine

482
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,709
The stars that shine

483
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,275
This is no mere infatuation

484
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,113
One, two, three, four
We love your voice, so sing some more

485
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,792
This time it's real
The sweet sensation

486
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:07,391
Always and always together

487
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,592
That's how it's fated to be

488
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,799
Today

489
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,949
Tomorrow

490
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,954
Forever

491
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:30,557
You are the one girl

492
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,351
For me

493
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,349
You are my one love

494
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,189
And now, ladies, don't you think
a sailor would make a perfect judge

495
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,833
for our Tempting Kiss contest?

496
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,474
Where's the handsome one?

497
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,511
Oh, well, you'll do.
We want you to be our judge.

498
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,949
You're going to be Mr Temptation.

499
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,833
- Oh, no, you don't.
- He seems to be a little bit shy.

500
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,791
But we'll take care of that,
won't we, girls?

501
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,194
Can you imagine anyone being shy
who comes from...

502
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,311
Where'd you say you were from?
He's from Brooklyn!

503
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,837
Now, before our contest begins,
a word on behalf of our sponsor. We...

504
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,188
I didn't say Brooklyn.

505
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,348
We of the Tempting Kiss
Lipstick Company believe...

506
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,712
- I was born in Ottumwa, Iowa.
- Ottumwa, Iowa! Well...

507
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,957

509
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,672

Now, please. You just go

513
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,394
Will you, please? Just take a chair
for a minute. Right over there.

514
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,714
That's right. Thank you very much.

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,276
Our product is sold in the stubby,

Harlan, Kentucky.

518
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,152
Quincy, Massachusetts.

519
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,511
Clearwater, Florida.

520
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,757
San Diego, California.

521
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:25,072
San Diego? That's my station.
I gotta get off of here.

522
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,918
Oh, no, you don't. No, you don't.

523
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,075
You're going to stay right here

524
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,236
and select the most kissable girl
in San Diego.

525
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,916
Now, remember, ladies, it's within
Mr Temptatiors power

526
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,031
to give any of you a mink coat

527
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,038
and 10 glorious days in Honolulu!

528
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,315
All right.

529
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,318
All right, now one contestant at a time,
please, one at a time.

530
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,112
Ready? Go!

531
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,238
One at a time, girls, one at a time!
One at a time!

532
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,354
Ladies, ladies, ladies!

533
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,312
Ladies, one at a time.
Oh, stop it, you stupid, old...

534
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,472
One at a time, girls!

535
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,279
One at a time!

536
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,468
Stop!

537
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,555
One at a time!

538
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,119
- Maybe he's in Studio 7.
- Try it. Try it.

539
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,595
I am Pierre. I am the top man.

540
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,709
There he is.

541
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,237
I am the top man.
This man is an impostor.

542
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,596
These lovely models will now show
the newest trend in swim fashion.

543
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,835
What a town this is.

544
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,349
The dames won't have anything to do
with sailors around here.

545
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,748
Oh, yeah?

546
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,788
Wait till you see the beautiful babe
that's gonna meet me here.

547
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,956
Boy, look at those beautiful babes.

548
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,868
Hey, the one on the end is my date.

549
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:32,236
The black Lastex moulded
one-piece suit with one shoulder strap.

550
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,316
Note the water-proofed jewelled pin
at the neckline.

551
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,477
Wait a minute. Hey, ain't that Jones?

552
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,751
It's Mr Temptation.

553
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,997
Hey, he's kissing my dame.

554
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,990
What's the matter,
somebody blow a tube?

555
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,599
Yeah, my friend here.

556
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:14,116
Hilda, please let me explain.
It wasrt my fault.

557
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,071
Well, you certainly acted
like you enjoyed it.

558
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,077
Go on back to your public,
Mr Temptation.

559
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,189
I'm going back to the base.

560
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,958
Oh, but, Hilda, listen.

561
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,512
Please, leave me alone.
I can hardly breathe.

562
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,752
Well, here you are.

563
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,599
Now, before you run away again,
I want to know who won our contest.

564
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,598
I don't care who won the contest.
All I know is I lost.

565
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,631
But we must know who won our contest.

566
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,830
Now, who's the most kissable girl
in San Diego?

567
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,154
Miss Hilda Jones
of the Navy training centre.

568
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,315
Some nerve!

569
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,273
Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

570
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,470
You're my witnesses. Thank you.

571
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,715
Hilda.

572
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,069
Hilda.

573
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,069
Hilda!

574
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,395
Don't speak to me
after kissing all those girls.

575
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,557
- You won the contest.
- You can have your old contest

576
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,553
and you can have your piece of string,
too. I don't want it!

577
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,033
Hilda!

578
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,279
Hilda!

579
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,308
Hilda!

580
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,549
Hilda!

581
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,919
Hilda!

582
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,955
What's the matter, sailor,
did you lose something?

583
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,832
I lost a piece of string.

584
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,790
You wouldn't have any Benadryl,
would you?

585
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,751
This one must've been drinking
tear gas.

586
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,515
Oh, gee.
I was just trying to find a string.

587
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,634
Imagine just kissing girls
putting a guy in a hospital.

588
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,471
Hey, Doc,
what room is Melvin Jones in?

589
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,397
Right in here. But no visitors.

590
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,794
No kidding. Is he real sick?

591
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,070
He has an oedema
of the olfactory system.

592
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,998
See? You ask a foolish question,
you get a foolish answer.

593
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,270
And stay out of this room, huh?

594
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,559
Oh, pardon me, Lieutenant.

595
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,319
Jones in 116. He won't take his pill.

596
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,670
- Oh, he won't, eh?
- Pardon me, Lieutenant.

597
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,756
- How's our friend Jones?
- I don't know.

598
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,713
But if he doesn't cooperate with me,
his condition is going to be a lot worse.

599
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,149
How would you like me to be waiting
for you when you get off duty?

600
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,635
How would you like to spend 30 days
in the brig?

601
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,471
I see you got refrigeration here.

602
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,353
When it comes to sailors,
she's colder than a deep freeze.

603
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,556
And my pal Melvirs just lucky enough
to be the one to defrost her.

604
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,592
Come on, now, let's take this pill.

605
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,192
I only have a 13 and a half neck.
It'll choke me.

606
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,312
Not if you take it
with a big swallow of water.

607
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,918
I want my mother.

608
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,593
Isn't he sweet?

609
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,155
Now, if your mother was here,
she'd say,

610
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,872
"Open your mouth."

611
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,791
Well, come on, open it.

612
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,391
Open it up. Come on.

613
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,080
That's right. Now, stick out your tongue.

614
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,553
Stick it out.

615
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,318
Now, take a big swallow of water.

616
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,678
That's the boy.

617
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,269
- It went down.
- Of course it did.

618
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,717
Now, it'll make you sleep.
Come on, now, lie back.

619
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,510
Lieutenant, I'm homesick.

620
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,310
- I don't think I'll be able to sleep.
- But you must sleep.

621
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,591
If my mother was here,
she'd kiss me right here.

622
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,354
All right.

623
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,710
It's sure taking her a long time
to give him a pill.

624
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,752
He probably didn't cooperate,
and she had to get rough.

625
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,429
Hey, let's take a look.

626
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,757
Sleep well, my dear boy.

627
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,357
Boy, the way those models
went after that Melvin...

628
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,198
I don't know. It's a mystery to me.

629
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,276
Did you see the way
they tore him apart?

630
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:37,558
I figure it this way.
Girls just can't resist him.

631
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,592
Hey, I'll lay a little money
I can pick a dame

632
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,312
who won't have anything to do with him.

633
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,396
If she does, I'll pay off.

634
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,955
- Well, put up or shut up.
- I'll bet six months pay.

635
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,071
- I'll take $100 of that.
- I'll take $200 of that.

636
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,235
I'll bet my wristwatch.

637
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,352
Okay, I'll take all bets.
You're all covered.

638
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,836
And if you know of anybody else,
just send them around to see me.

639
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,949
Hey, Chief.

640
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,479
Sailing orders for your draft.

641
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,077
Okay, men, gather around.
These are our orders.

642
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,590
"For the purpose of fleet training

643
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,320
"and for familiarisation
with various types of naval craft,

644
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,871
"Training Squadron 87 B will be
dispatched to Honolulu

645
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,831
"in the following manner."

646
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,953
They got it cut up into three classes.
Destroyers, battleships and submarine.

647
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,150
- Submarine?
- Yeah, and our group's on it.

648
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,714
Honolulu.

649
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,669
Hey, that's where Corinne Calvet is.
I'll be able to see her.

650
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,791
You better be careful
Melvin doesn't see her first.

651
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,755
Hey, that's the girl. Corinne.

652
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,151
All the dough that Jones can't make
the grade with her.

653
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,236
- Corinne?
- No, that makes it too tough.

654
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,955
- What's the matter, you getting yellow?
- Okay, Corinne it is.

655
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,834
All right, men, let's get on the ball.
Turn in and get a good night's sleep.

656
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,871
Tomorrow we're on our way.

657
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,319
Now, hear this.
http://www.divx-titlovi.com

658
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,034
Now, hear this. Drill in one hour.

659
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,275
Hi, Al. Look, I'm all cured.

660
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,120
Well, you look like you're in shape
to kiss a girl.

661
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,879
Hilda? Oh, she's mad at me.
She won't even talk to me.

662
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,399
No, not Hilda.

663
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,829
Well, you know, any other dame,
I can't get close to.

664
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,393
I get a swelling in back of my nose.

665
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,238
If you don't get close to the girl
I tell you to,

666
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,271
you'll get a swelling
in the front of your nose.

667
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,231
There's a lot of money bet on you.

668
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,316
What if Tiger disappears
with all that loot?

669
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,592
Don't worry.
I got a couple of guys watching him.

670
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,076
And he's holding the bets.

671
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,475
Holding bets on me? What for?

672
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:34,280
- Now, look, you're my pal, right?
- Yeah.

673
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,995
I said that no girl can resist you,
and Lardoski says they can.

674
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,917
So the guys got a lot of dough together,

675
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,713
and they bet that you can kiss any girl
that Lardoski named.

676
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,398
He named Corinne.

677
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,673
And, kid, I bet a bundle myself.

678
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,109
What if I'm allergic to her
and I can't kiss her?

679
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,117
Then you and all the boys will lose
all your money.

680
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,876
I won't do it on purpose, but if I do,
well, you can borrow money from me.

681
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,639
- No, Melvin, that's all right.
- Oh, no. I won't take no for an answer.

682
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,877
You are my friend and you are my pal.
You can have all the money you want.

683
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,276
- No, Melvin, that's all right.
- What do you keep saying no for?

684
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,078
Because I bet six months of your pay

685
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,679
and every cent you had
in your money belt.

686
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,233
Well, that's no reason to say no.

687
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,588
Because you bet six months of my pay

688
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,280
and all the money in my money belt?

689
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,230
Take it easy.
Now, just shut up and listen.

690
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:21,113
There was nothing else I could do.
You're my buddy, right?

691
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,353
You wouldn't want me to lose my money
and not lose yours, too, would you?

692
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,471
Oh, well, that would be selfish
on your part.

693
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,353
Sure. Besides, if you win,
you'll practically be a millionaire.

694
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,391
If I win, I won't be able to breathe.

695
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,909
Now, which is more important,
breathing or money?

696
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,190
Besides, the boys bet a fortune on you.

697
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,835
All right, I'll do the best I can.

698
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,077
And where's this Corinne dame,
anyway?

699
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,189
Honolulu.

700
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,351
Well, what's there to worry about?

701
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,596
If she's in Honolulu,
we're here in San Diego,

702
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,075
- it could be years before we ever met.
- Yeah.

703
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,069
Yeah.

704
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,117
We're going to Honolulu tomorrow.

705
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,953
Tomorrow?

706
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,115
- What ship?
- Not by ship.

707
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,952
- Not by ship?
- No.

708
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,832
- Plane?
- Not by plane.

709
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,313
Not by plane?

710
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,557
What do they want us to do,
swim across?

711
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,353
- We're going by submarine.
- Oh, submarine.

712
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:13,869
I get sick going down in an elevator.

713
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,638
- What did he have to wind them for?
- Quit your beefing.

714
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,671
You're lucky nobody bet a cuckoo clock.

715
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,029
Detail, halt.

716
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,071
Detail from Training Squadron 87 B
reporting as ordered, sir.

717
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,349
At ease, men.

718
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,190
Lardoski, you'll be the only one
for whom it will not be a new experience

719
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,834
to sail aboard a submarine.
You'll be in charge of our passengers

720
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,678
and see that they don't get in the way
of ship's company.

721
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,552
- Yes, sir.
- It must be remembered that

722
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,159
we're merely transporting them.

723
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,430
They'll get their further assignments
when we get to Honolulu.

724
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:58,995
And for the rest of you men,

725
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,873
there is a certain freedom that's
permitted in the submarine service.

726
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,992
Among the officers and enlisted men,
we do away with the usual formalities

727
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,872
because of the confined space.

728
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,157
All right, Lardoski, you can load them
aboard the forward torpedo room hatch.

729
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,636
Oh, he's friendly.
Wort this be ginger peachy?

730
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,028
Yeah, real keen.

731
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,232
All right, men, follow me, single file.
Let's go!

732
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,918
Put your bag right down the hatch.

733
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,998
Take it easy now.

734
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,073
Watch your step.

735
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,277
You'll get used to it.

736
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,359
Follow him right down.

737
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,993
Bag, that's right.

738
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,951
I'm very glad we're gonna be informal.

739
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:49,072
My name is Melvin Jones,
but you can call me Melvin.

740
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,909
- Go on, get going!
- I'm going. You don't have to yell.

741
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,035
Why don't you watch what you're doing?

742
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,037
Stop the head, Al, stop the head.

743
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,879
- I don't like it here. I'm gonna quit.
- What do you mean quit?

744
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,116
Submarine service is
the safest part of the Navy.

745
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,832
Safest part? I almost got killed.

746
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,793
All you have to do is keep your head up,
eyes straight and watch your step.

747
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,558
Once you get the hang of it,
it's very simple.

748
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,595
Head up, eyes straight
and watch your step.

749
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,757
Now, let's go find our quarters
before something else happens to you.

750
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,273
Oh, come on!

751
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,591
Gee, I hope they checked this for leaks.

752
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,392
Watch where you're going.

753
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,715
Hey, Al, it ain't much,
but we could fix it up.

754
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,592
Well, do you think
it's good enough for us?

755
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,757
Not really, but I think we should grab it
before a couple of other guys do.

756
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,189
- Somebody else already grabbed it.
- Yeah?

757
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,038
Well, possession is
nine points of the law.

758
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:57,230
I'd like to see somebody else grab it,
huh, Al?

759
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,555
We'll put clean sheets on
and everything.

760
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,597
Melvin, you better leave the sheets on.

761
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,518
Leave the sheets on?
How do we know who slept on it?

762
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,072
Come on, Al, you're not helping me
at all. Throw these out in the hall.

763
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,317
- AI, the Commander. The Commander.
- This is my stateroom, sailor.

764
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,874
You've got one minute
to get this place cleaned up and get out,

765
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,230
or you'll spend the rest of this trip
chained to a torpedo!

766
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,237
I'm sorry, sir, we'll take care of it.

767
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,873
We'd better hurry.
They'll be assigning bunks.

768
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,830
All right, men, get your gear in order

769
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,349
and stow your empty sea bags
under the bunks.

770
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,838
And where were you?
Kissing the engineer?

771
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,555
- Come on, Lardoski, lay off of him.
- Yeah, lay off. I've been sick.

772
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,591
That first bunk is yours.

773
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,599
- Oh!
- Not up there. Down there.

774
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,037
- How am I supposed to get in there?
- You just lie down,

775
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,789
and the man above pulls his bunk down,
gets in, and so on.

776
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,118
Turk, Crowthers, these two are yours.

777
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,874
Bull, 'Bama, take those two.

778
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,190
Put that back into your sea bag.

779
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,197
It's just in case
we have to abandon ship.

780
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,436
I said put it back.
http://www.divx-titlovi.com

781
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,990
How can I get this back in my sea bag?

782
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,433
Now, get rid of that thing,
then turn in, all of you.

783
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,153
Shut up and turn in, all of you.

784
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,713
Big man, big...

785
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,474
Hey, Al?

786
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,708
- What?
- I forgot to take my shoes off.

787
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,072
- Hey, Turk.
- What?

788
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,792
He forgot to take his shoes off.

789
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,314
Thank you.

790
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,872
- You all right now?
- I never sleep with my shoes on.

791
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,955
All right, come on. Let's go.

792
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,238
You can put it down now.

793
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,479
Okay, Turk.

794
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:11,714
Hey, Al?

795
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,150
- What?
- I forgot to brush my teeth.

796
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,748
- Oh, do it in the morning.
- I'm thirsty.

797
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,950
Drill a hole in the side of the ship.

798
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,872
Where will I get the tools?

799
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,353
Lie still, will you?

800
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:29,354
I think I'm gonna faint. I gotta get up.

801
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,232
- Hey, Turk.
- What?

802
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,794
- Melvirs gotta get up.
- Why does he gotta get up?

803
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,718
He's sick. We gotta take care of him.
We gotta a lot of dough on him.

804
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,592
We've done everything
but sing him to sleep.

805
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,676
I like to be sung to sleep.

806
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,828
Okay, okay. I'll do that, too.

807
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,035
Today

808
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,952
Tomorrow, forever

809
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,595
What's going on here?
You were ordered secured for the night.

810
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,312
- Yes, sir.
- Who was singing?

811
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,953
I was, sir. Seaman Crowthers.

812
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,752
Report to me in the mess compartment
in 10 minutes.

813
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,155
He didn't do it, sir. It was me.

814
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,759
Do what you want with me.

815
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,917
Swing me to the yardarm,
batten me down the hatches,

816
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:10,793
hoist me to the mizzenmast,
make me walk the plank,

817
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:13,798
throw me to the sharks.
I did the singing.

818
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,349
You couldn't.

819
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,116
- Crowthers reporting, sir.
- Very well.

820
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,912
Hey, I only sent for Crowthers.

821
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,712
Well, we wanted to take
the blame, too, sir.

822
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,637
I'm not blaming him for anything.

823
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,955
As you know, life aboard a submarine
can be pretty confining.

824
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,274
We like to keep the morale up.

825
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,231
I thought he'd like to sing
with the boys here.

826
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,909
- Oh, you mind if the fellows sit in?
- No, carry on.

827
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,075
Thank you, sir.

828
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,476
Well, let's start messing around
with something.

829
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,318
You know The Sailors' Polka?

830
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,829
Let's go.

831
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:49,509
Come on and play the sailors' polka

832
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,872
Make way for Navy blue

833
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,232
Oh, how the girls all love to polka

834
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:02,559
With a sailor who's tried and true

835
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,355
Where there is music
and there's moonlight

836
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,437
The Navy knows what to do

837
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,750
So come on and play the sailors' polka

838
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:18,712
Make way for Navy blue

839
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,710
Oh, the band will start in playing

840
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,831
When the fleet comes sailing in

841
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,951
They'll be hip hip hip hooray-ing

842
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,991
And the good times will begin

843
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,076
They'll be gobs and gobs of misses

844
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,191
Who'll be waiting on the shore

845
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,231
With gobs and gobs of kisses

846
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,271
For the gobs that they adore

847
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,356
Long before they drop the anchor

848
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,357
You will hear the music start

849
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,391
Every pretty girl will hanker

850
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,033
To win a sailor's heart

851
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,594
Yeah, the band will start in playing

852
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,517
And the dancing will begin

853
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,950
When the fleet comes sailing in

854
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:56,671
Come on and play the sailors' polka

855
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,796
Make way for Navy blue

856
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:04,390
Oh, how the girls all love to polka

857
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,558
With a sailor who's tried and true

858
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,871
Where there is music
And there is moonlight

859
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,912
The Navy knows what to do

860
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,470
So come on and play the sailors' polka

861
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,229
Make way for Navy blue

862
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,078
Make way for Na...

863
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,117
Submerge, submerge.

864
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:36,790
...vy
...vy

865
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:38,313
Scrape the bottom.

866
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,755
- Blue
- Blue

867
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,592
Clark, go forward and relieve the watch.

868
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:55,789
Aye, aye, Chief.

869
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,036
Hey, Jones, take these wheels,
will you?

870
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,918
Chief, the hydraulic line carried away.
Come on down and give me a lift.

871
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,029
Okay.

872
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,510
I wonder which one is the brake.

873
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,349
Take the scope.
I'll see what's going on down there.

874
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,432
What are you, a wise guy?

875
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,959
You ought to be shot out of a torpedo.

876
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,469
- He ought to be shot, period.
- I didn't mean to do nothing.

877
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,589
Knock it off.

878
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,109
Jones, you've caused more trouble
in the few days you've been on my ship

879
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,959
- than I've had in all my years of service.
- Nobody's perfect.

880
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:46,310
Lardoski, will you see
that he's kept out of mischief

881
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,158
- until we reach Pearl Harbour?
- Aye, aye, sir.

882
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:56,073
I know a very nice, quiet, safe place

883
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,509
to put you for the rest of this voyage.

884
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,995
Come on!

885
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,274
This is the Captain speaking
to all you new men.

886
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:53,752
We're going to make a dive shortly.
This is a normal operation.

887
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,950
You'll hear two blasts
on the diving alarm,

888
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,513
and in about 50 seconds we'll be under.

889
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:03,032
Clear the bridge, clear the bridge.
Dive, dive.

890
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,152
Green board, pressure in the boat, sir.

891
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,113
- Very well, 60 feet.
- 60 feet. Aye, aye, sir.

892
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,909
Al! Al!

893
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,512
Hey, down there,
if you can hear me, yell "Roger!"

894
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,554
- What is it, Captain?
- I don't know. You look.

895
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,835
If you can't hear me, can you see me?

896
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,188
Over. Roger.

897
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,953
- What do you figure it is?
- I've got no idea, sir.

898
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,750
It's Melvin. Melvin Jones.

899
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,868
Let's see.

900
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,597
Bye, seagull.

901
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,108
Pete, take a look at this.

902
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:51,794
- Did you make it out?
- Can't make it out, Captain.

903
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:53,834
Let's wipe it off.

904
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,548
- Still there, sir.
- Let's see.

905
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,354
Al! Al!

906
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:11,879
Take a look at this.

907
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,391
Looks like a sea monster to me,
Captain.

908
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:19,112
Sea monster? What?

909
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,030
I've never seen anything like it before.

910
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,515
Make all preparations to surface.
Two main engines.

911
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,108
Standby to surface. Two main engines.
Aye, aye, sir.

912
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:57,195
Hey, you, there! Get down here.

913
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:00,790
- Who is that man?
- This is a fine way to treat a guest.

914
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:05,233
- What's that character doing up there?
- That character, sir, is Melvin Jones.

915
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,591
- Hey, you, get down here!
- I'm hurrying.

916
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,676
I'm coming as fast as I can.

917
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,835
You, Jones,
what were you doing on deck?

918
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,473
You closed the doors.

919
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,316
I can't swim. I could've drowned.

920
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,670
Didrt you hear the order
to clear the bridge and dive?

921
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:26,991
- Dive? I just told you I can't swim.
- Lay below.

922
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,759
- Through the hatch.
- Aye, aye, sir.

923
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,191
Liberty commences immediately.

924
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:08,949
Expires on board at 0745 tomorrow.

925
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:10,718
Leave your quarters.

926
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,909
Honolulu!

927
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:19,119
Come on, let's go.

928
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,792
Pearl Harbour.

929
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,309
- Corinne.
- Oh, you lucky women.

930
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,752
Oh, you catching cold?

931
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,959
- No, I think there's girls on shore.
- You mean you can smell them?

932
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,230
No, he's used to that.
Every time women are around,

933
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,349
that's what happens to him.

934
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,516
He has that female radar
built right in his nose.

935
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,551
- And when it clogs, it means girls.
- Dames.

936
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,669
Women.

937
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,989
Now, put me down, fellas, please.

938
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:46,714
Hey, Al, tell them to put me down!

939
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:50,037
Fellas, please put me down.

940
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,352
Come on, fellas, will you put me down?

941
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,392
He's allergic to dames, lady.
We're using him like radar.

942
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:00,553
Yeah, they must be in here.
Look, his eyes are getting watery.

943
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:03,911
I can't breathe.
Put me down, I can't breathe.

944
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:06,474
That means we're warm.
Coming in, Lardoski?

945
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,036
You can say that again, mate.
And I'll point out Corinne.

946
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,957
You don't have to. I saw the picture.

947
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,354
Hilda!
http://www.divx-titlovi.com

948
01:03:15,120 --> 01:03:16,394
Don't you "Hilda" me.

949
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,839
I'm even sorry we have the same name.

950
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,758
Let me down, fellas.
Are you stationed here?

951
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,155
No, I'm living here
for the 10 glorious days

952
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:25,635
I won on the Tempting Kiss
Lipstick contest.

953
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,875
The Navy granted me a leave.

954
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,195
Lady, stay away from him,
will you, please?

955
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:30,799
He's concentrating on only one dame.

956
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,036
Don't worry, sailor,
I'll stay away from him,

957
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,435
- as far as I can get.
- Hilda, please.

958
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,915
- Save your strength, Romeo.
- Hilda.

959
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,679
- Come on. Let's go inside.
- Let me down, fellas.

960
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,115
Hilda!

961
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,155
Hilda.

962
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:49,713
Merci beaucoup

963
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,992
Thank you, monsieur

964
01:03:52,360 --> 01:03:53,679
Thank you

965
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,479
The cocktails you served
Were really so grand

966
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:04,559
And my heart skipped a beat
When you touched my hand

967
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,556
As you served me the

968
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,396
Caviar

969
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:13,353
And that delightful cheese

970
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,437
It was so nice

971
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,439
Merci beaucoup

972
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,030
Thank you, monsieur

973
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:27,752
Thank you

974
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,313
I'm afraid that the wine
It went to my head

975
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,237
But I got such a

976
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,400
Thrill

977
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:40,392
- There she is.
- What a piece of furniture.

978
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:43,671
Wow! I ain't never seen anything
like that except in pictures.

979
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:46,234
Gee, I wonder how that dress
would look on Hilda.

980
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,552
- Come on, let's go to the bar.
- Come on.

981
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:56,230
It was so nice

982
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,439
Thank you, monsieur

983
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,516
Thank you

984
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,995
- A bourbon and water, please.
- I'll have a Scotch and water.

985
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,109
Right, sir.

986
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:20,639
I thought you were out of the Navy,
Lardoski.

987
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,079
Oh, I shipped over.

988
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,508
Where did Corinne go?

989
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,477
She'll be back soon. Are you still trying?

990
01:05:25,600 --> 01:05:27,750
- Isn't everybody?
- They sure are.

991
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,394
My singer quit me last week on account
of she wouldn't date him.

992
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:31,589
I didn't understand it.

993
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,154
She used to get dreamy-eyed
every time he'd sing like this.

994
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,111
Moonlight becomes you

995
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:37,275
Oh, you mean,

996
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,392
Moonlight becomes you

997
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:43,512
Say, my patrons would enjoy having
a serviceman entertain them.

998
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:46,313
- Oh, I'm not interested.
- A little number in front of the band?

999
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:48,158
Anything the boys want is on the house.

1000
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,793
Oh, that's different!

1001
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:59,317
- Melvin, you're staying with me.
- I want to find Hilda.

1002
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,429
You're staying with me

1003
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:02,357
if you have to stand next to me
while I sing the song.

1004
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,118
Oh, Al, no. Al.

1005
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,195
- What was the name?
- AI Crowthers.

1006
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:08,029
Ladies and gentlemen, we're very
fortunate in having a guest artist,

1007
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:10,355
Seaman Al Crowthers,
United States Navy.

1008
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,512
All right, Melvin,
you're gonna do a song with me.

1009
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:17,916
- I don't know no song.
- Sure, the one we did in the submarine?

1010
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:19,912
Oh, yeah, I like that number.

1011
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,519
- The Sailors' Polka.
- Yeah, what do I do in it?

1012
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:22,914
- You do the fast part.
- How's it go?

1013
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:26,112
Oh, the band will start in playing
And the good times will begin

1014
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,753
Oh, that's good. What part do you sing?

1015
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:28,835
The slow part.

1016
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:31,713
Come on and play the sailors' polka

1017
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,398
Oh, let's try it.

1018
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:38,597
- Come on and play the sailors' polka
- Oh, the band will start in

1019
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:43,316
playing

1020
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:44,839
Mel.

1021
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:47,595
You're probably wondering
why I stopped.

1022
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,439
- You forgot the words?
- Come on, Melvin, do the fast parts.

1023
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:53,438
Oh, the band will start in playing
And the good times will begin

1024
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,790
I got it now. Hurry up before I forget.

1025
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:59,392
- Come on and play the sailors'
- Oh, the band will start in playing

1026
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,669
Shut up!

1027
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:02,355
What's wrong with you?

1028
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,311
You got the easy part,
that's what's wrong.

1029
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,431
- You want to switch parts?
- Yeah, let me do your part.

1030
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:07,629
Okay.

1031
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:12,718
Come on and play the sailors' polka

1032
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:17,231
I see birdies with wheels so bare

1033
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,308
"See birdies with wheels so bare"?

1034
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:22,112
- Oh, you, too?
- Will you get out of here?

1035
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,435
Well, I didn't know the words,
so I made them up.

1036
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,437
I don't like that song, anyhow.

1037
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,358
How would you like to do a song
in unison?

1038
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,199
- No, let's do it here in the club.
- Sure. Why leave?

1039
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,955
Let's make it a little harder.
You and I do a trio.

1040
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:36,071
Where we gonna get four guys?

1041
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,880
Look, in this next number,
you don't even have to know the song.

1042
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,274
You don't even have to sing.

1043
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,277
Oh, we're gonna do another one
together both?

1044
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,868
"Together both"? That's as bad as,
"Up the street, the soldiers,

1045
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,479
"they're marching down."

1046
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,872
Now, come on, let's sing the song.
You just automatically flow right into it.

1047
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,797
- All right, let's flow.
- Okay.

1048
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:02,915
My grandpa was a minstrel man

1049
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:06,710
A minstrel man was he

1050
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,035
And to tell the truth

1051
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:11,071
I guess I've got

1052
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,477
Some minstrel blood in me

1053
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:17,914
You can have all the harps in heaven

1054
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:21,237
Blow all the horns here on the ground

1055
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:23,920
But I find I still

1056
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,595
Get my greatest thrill

1057
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:31,712
Every time I hear this sound

1058
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:34,115
I love to hear

1059
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,995
An old calliope

1060
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:41,830
I love the melody of an old calliope

1061
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,676
And when you hear

1062
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:48,198
The thrilling harmony

1063
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:52,313
Gather round
The minstrel's show's in town

1064
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:55,669
It sounds so grand

1065
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:58,748
That old calliope

1066
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,474
What is more heavenly

1067
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,160
Than an old calliope

1068
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:06,475
Here comes the band

1069
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,872
Oh, what a sight to see

1070
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,630
Gather round
The minstrel's show's in town

1071
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,275
Banjos strumming

1072
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,715
Folks are humming

1073
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,115
Minstrel's coming

1074
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:34,433
What a show
What a show

1075
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,915
- It's the finest show I know
- It's the finest show I know

1076
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,474
- It's coming near
- It's coming near, it's coming near

1077
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,830
- That old calliope
- What a sight to see

1078
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,633
- Oh, what a melody
- What a melody

1079
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:47,194
- On the old calliope
- Old calliope

1080
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:49,914
- So loud and clear
- So loud and clear

1081
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,112
- That thrilling harmony
- That thrilling harmony

1082
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:54,992
- Gather round
- Gather round

1083
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,918
- The minstrel's show's in town
- The minstrel's show's in town

1084
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:04,279
There's the interlocutor

1085
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:07,153
And Mr Bones so full of life

1086
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,954
Who's that lady
You were with last night?

1087
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,469
That was no lady
That was my wife

1088
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:13,919
- Ha ha
- Ha ha

1089
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,234
- Ho ho
- Ho ho

1090
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,793
- What a show what a show
- What a show what a show

1091
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:17,989
- What a show
- What a show

1092
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,554
Says the interlocutor

1093
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:23,194
To Mr Bones so full of pride

1094
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:28,276
- Why does a chicken cross the road?
- Why, to get to that other side

1095
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,271
I love to hear

1096
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,395
An old calliope

1097
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:55,193
I love the melody

1098
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,709
Of an old calliope

1099
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,308
And when you hear

1100
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,113
That thrilling harmony

1101
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:05,879
- Gather round
- Gather round

1102
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:10,710
- The minstrel's show's in town
- The minstrel's show's in town

1103
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,672
We're going to take you with us
wherever we go.

1104
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,950
With that voice of yours,
we'll get free drinks all over the world.

1105
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,149
- Okay.
- What'll you have?

1106
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,874
Ginger ale. Then I wanna go home.

1107
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,911
I don't think Corinne is gonna show up.

1108
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,593
There she blows.

1109
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:42,628
Who's the tugboat with her?

1110
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:45,433
Oh, that's her secretary.
Her first line of defence.

1111
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:47,669
Wow.

1112
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,468
Hold fast.

1113
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,678
Here's to Corinne.

1114
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,911
- Here's to Hilda.
- To dames.

1115
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,155
Women.

1116
01:12:58,280 --> 01:13:00,077
Hello, Corinne, baby.

1117
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:02,033
Remember me?

1118
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,998
Miss Calvet to you.
Now go away, sailor, will you?

1119
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:08,317
Oh, just testing. Same old Corinne.

1120
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,033
All right, come on, champ.
Now you can do it.

1121
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:14,354
Yeah, she can't resist you.

1122
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,233
- I want Hilda.
- After all the dough we've got on you?

1123
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:20,750
Go on, lover boy,
take a crack at Miss Hard-to-get.

1124
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:22,639
And keep an eye on him,

1125
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:26,036
because pretty soon everything on him
belongs to me.

1126
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:28,156
I wish everything on me
belonged to somebody.

1127
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,511
The way I'm ticking, my heart could stop
and I wouldn't know it for two days.

1128
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,835
- You ready, Melvin?
- No, I'm scared.

1129
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:35,279
Come on,
there's nothing to worry about.

1130
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:38,358
- Come on, Melvin.
- Come on.

1131
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,516
- All right.
- Atta boy.

1132
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,868
- Good luck, Melvin.
- You can do it.

1133
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:42,989
Watch this.

1134
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,834
Hi, girls.

1135
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,751
Don't say a word. Maybe they'll go away.

1136
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,552
- Sit down, Melvin.
- Thank you.

1137
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:55,477
Oh, pardon me,
but my name is Melvin Jones.

1138
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,352
Would you like a sarsaparilla?

1139
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,475
You sure he's a sailor?

1140
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,273
Oh, sure. He's a wonderful guy
once you get to know him.

1141
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,516
- We won't be around that long.
- Let's you and I dance.

1142
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,073
Oh, I'd love...

1143
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,997
Miss Calvet and I have
an agreement with the management.

1144
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,998
We can't mingle with the guests,
especially sailors.

1145
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,157
We only have an hour.
What can happen in an hour?

1146
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:16,391
Now I'm not sure you're a sailor.

1147
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:19,034
Go ahead. This one looks safe.

1148
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:23,759
I don't feel safe.

1149
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,828
- Do you have a light?
- Oh, I don't smoke.

1150
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,030
- Do you mind if I do?
- Oh, yes, I do.

1151
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:33,152
You see, the smoke irritates
the membranes in my nose.

1152
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,998
Then my uvula becomes
oedematous and...

1153
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:36,269
Why don't you speak English?

1154
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,914
Oh, I am. That means I can't breathe.

1155
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,671
Well, I'm starting to feel that way, too.

1156
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,995
Oh. You know, I wanted to say that...

1157
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,599
- Well...
- Sailor, I don't know

1158
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,517
what you and your friend have in mind,

1159
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:52,710
but please count me out of it, will you?

1160
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,674
- I think I better leave.
- I'm sorry.

1161
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,270
You're not bad at all.
You're the quiet type, aren't you?

1162
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:01,958
Not the wolf type.

1163
01:15:03,160 --> 01:15:05,071
May I walk with you?

1164
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,039
Now, you see,
why did you have to spoil everything?

1165
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:12,233
Just like the other sailors.
My answer is the same to everyone.

1166
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:13,475
No.

1167
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,279
Hello, Corinne.

1168
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,913
How about me taking you
to the base gym tonight

1169
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:19,473
to see the Navy Relief Smoker?

1170
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,875
Sailor, I'd love to,
but this is a public appearance,

1171
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,197
- not a private one.
- Yeah, and excuse me, sir, I'm with her.

1172
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,799
Oh, go pick a coconut, sailor.

1173
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:29,559
- Oh, no, I have an appointment with her.
- Well, I just cancelled it.

1174
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:31,671
What do you mean by barging in
when I'm talking to a lady?

1175
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,836
Shove off before
I belt you where you breathe!

1176
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,951
Take your hand off me.
You're wrinkling this suit.

1177
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,149
Now, stop, both of you!

1178
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:39,191
- You coward, hiding behind a lady.
- Why, you!

1179
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:41,550
All right, men, that's enough.
There'll be no brawling in public.

1180
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:44,035
- What seems to be the trouble, Melvin?
- No trouble, Al.

1181
01:15:44,160 --> 01:15:46,720
It's a good thing you came along,
Lieutenant. I'd have smashed him.

1182
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:49,070
I'm Lieutenant Conners,
Base Recreation Officer.

1183
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,476
There's no use wasting a good fight.

1184
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,477
You fellas can settle your score
at the base gym tonight.

1185
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,113
I'd have given him the old one-two, Al.

1186
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,071
Three, four, seven, eight, nine.

1187
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,794
- The base gym?
- The fights start at 8:00.

1188
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,595
And you better be there
promptly, too, buddy.

1189
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:05,951
- And if I ain't there, start without me.
- Come on, Melvin.

1190
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,036
Well, he started it, Al.
I would've given him a shot...

1191
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,273
Why'd you put
the bandage on my hands

1192
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,753
before you put the gloves on?

1193
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,996
So when you hit him,
you won't break your knuckles.

1194
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:20,999
Why don't you put some on my shoes

1195
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:23,475
so I won't wear them out
from running away from him?

1196
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,239
Now, look, Melvin, half the fights are
won in the locker room.

1197
01:16:26,360 --> 01:16:29,352
- You got to wage psychological warfare.
- What?

1198
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,836
He's just as scared as you are.
Act like this is nothing to you.

1199
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:36,190
Make him believe you've been a fighter
all your life.

1200
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:39,999
Then he'll be so scared that when
you lift your arm, he'll fall right down.

1201
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,075
Yeah?

1202
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,031
I wouldn't let anything happen to you,
would I?

1203
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:44,559
We'll soon find out.

1204
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,955
Put on the act right now. Go ahead.

1205
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,196
Listen, Melvin,
how long you been fighting?

1206
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,594
Oh...

1207
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,356
I been fighting now
for about sisteen years.

1208
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:56,833
- Sisteen?
- Yeah.

1209
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,554
- Oh, it's about sisteen years.
- Sisteen. What do you mean?

1210
01:16:59,680 --> 01:17:01,830
- Sisteen. Fourteen, fifteen, sisteen.
- Sisteen.

1211
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:04,997
Oh, sure. How many fights have you
had altogether?

1212
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:06,348
Oh...

1213
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,557
Altogether now, when you add them up,
I had

1214
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:13,194
- 101 fights.101.
- Yeah.

1215
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:15,709
- I win them all but a hundred.
- Good.

1216
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,593
Where... Let's see,
where are you from originally?

1217
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,274
- Oh, I moved.
- You moved?

1218
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,630
Yeah. Originally I come from
Newark, New Jersey.

1219
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:25,079
That's my hometown.

1220
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,792
And I started fighting there,
I was just a kid.

1221
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,512
- I think I was...
- How old were you?

1222
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,108
- Oh, about sisteen years old.
- Sisteen?

1223
01:17:31,240 --> 01:17:34,118
- Like before. Fourteen, fifteen, sisteen.
- Sisteen. Yeah, sure.

1224
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:35,798
Well, who was your toughest fight?

1225
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,790
The toughest fight I had was
with Gene Tierney.

1226
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:43,433
- That was the toughest fight.
- Gene Tierney.

1227
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,879
You mean Gene Tunney.

1228
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,116
You fight who you want,
I fight who I want.

1229
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,037
Oh, yeah, I got it. Listen...

1230
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,397
You know, there are a lot of different
types of fighters in here, right?

1231
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:57,193
There're body punchers
and left hookers.

1232
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:59,788
- What are you, a boxer?
- No, I'm a cocker spaniel.

1233
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,751
What do you think I am?
Sure, I'm a boxer.

1234
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:04,952
- I'm a very, very crowd-pleasing boxer.
- Crowd-pleasing?

1235
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:07,594
Crowd-pleasing. I was fighting about
two and a half months ago

1236
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,711
- at the Howwood Wegion in California.
- Howwood Wegion?

1237
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:10,989
- The Howwood Wegion.
- Howwood Wegion.

1238
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:12,519
- Howwood Wegion in California.
- The Howwood Wegion?

1239
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,108
- The Hollywood Legion in California.
- California! Oh.

1240
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:16,229
I'm fighting there.

1241
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:18,112
I'm sitting in my dressing room,
minding my own business.

1242
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:20,390
A guy came backstage and says to me.
He says to me,

1243
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,715
"Kid, I'll give you
a tousand dollars if you do..."

1244
01:18:22,840 --> 01:18:24,796
No, he said he'd give you
a thousand dollars.

1245
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:29,397
- He said he'd give me a tousand dollars.
- A thousand dollars.

1246
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,317
- Oh, you know him?
- No, I don't know him.

1247
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,590
Oh, well, he offered me
a tousand dollars. I said...

1248
01:18:33,720 --> 01:18:35,358
Thousand dollars, he offered you.

1249
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:36,959
- Tousand dollars.
- Thousand.

1250
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:40,390
- Tou.
- T-H-O-U-S-A-N-D. Thousand.

1251
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:43,675
Thou, thou, thousand.

1252
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,199
- Thousand.
- Tousand dollars.

1253
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,435
- Thousand.
- Kid, this is tough.

1254
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:47,913
- It was ten hundred dollars.
- Ten hundred dollars!

1255
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,554
Ten hundred dollars. I said,
"What I gotta do for this money?"

1256
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:53,114
He said, "I'll give you the money
if you'll lay down in round two."

1257
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:54,958
Well, I had turned it down, naturally,

1258
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,638
because I never went
that distance before.

1259
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,159
Oh, yes, it's a long way to go.

1260
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,508
Hey, that guy's a professional.

1261
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,358
Gee whiz, I can't fight a professional.

1262
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:03,357
Why, that wouldn't be fair.
He's ring-wise.

1263
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:05,198
Say, come on in
to the other dressing room.

1264
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:06,469
I got an idea.

1265
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:07,828
- Good.
- I tell you one thing, though,

1266
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,349
the best fight I ever had in my whole life
was three years ago

1267
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,152
- in Por Orga.
- Where?

1268
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,077
- In Por Orga.
- Por Orga?

1269
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:15,599
- I was... Por Orga.
- Por Orga.

1270
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:19,076
- Por Orga! Por Orga!
- Oh, Portland, Oregon.

1271
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:22,476
- That wasrt so hard now, was it?
- No, it wasrt hard.

1272
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,717
Well, I got in the ring with that guy.
I don't forget that night, boy.

1273
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:28,229
I get the guy. I get one, two, three, four.

1274
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,828
And I thought I had him down that time
and I hit him a shot.

1275
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,029
Melvin!

1276
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:34,720
Hey! They've gone.

1277
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:37,513
Oh, what am I gonna do, Al?

1278
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,039
Don't worry about it.

1279
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:42,792
- Look, I'm gonna teach you what to do.
- Yeah, because I don't know.

1280
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,195
No, I'm gonna teach you to fight
in about a few seconds.

1281
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:47,914
Come over here. We'll pretend
that this is the squared circle. Right?

1282
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,315
- Yeah, yeah, what do I do?
- Always protect yourself.

1283
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:52,476
Put your guard up like that.
Put up your guard.

1284
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,033
- Yeah.
- Right, put this up. Right.

1285
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:56,635
Now, I hit you in the stomach.
Why? Why?

1286
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,398
Well, you hit me.

1287
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:01,717
Why? 'Cause it wasrt protected.
Always protect your stomach.

1288
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:02,829
Now watch. Put up...

1289
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,394
Hit you on the head. Why? Why?

1290
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:07,909
- It wasrt protected.
- You gotta protect it at the same time.

1291
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,474
Up, down. Up, down. Protect.
Up, one. Watch.

1292
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,875
The head, head. Stomach, stomach.
Head, stomach.

1293
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,355
Gotta watch yourself all the time, see?
Watch what you're doing.

1294
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:16,754
- Oh, that's good.
- Understand?

1295
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,393
- Yeah.
- Now, any other questions?

1296
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,909
Yeah, well, what happens
if we're in the ring

1297
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,759
- and he hugs me?
- He doesn't hug you. That's a clinch.

1298
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,313
- Yeah?
- Like this, watch.

1299
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:27,396
Now, we're gonna watch this hand.
Look, watch that hand.

1300
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,318
- Yeah, I'm watching it.
- No, protect it, not watch it.

1301
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,749
Protect yourself
with this other hand, here,

1302
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,552
and he'll hit you in the stomach
like that.

1303
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:36,557
- Oh, I see. Yeah.
- Always protect yourself at all times.

1304
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:39,478
Well, what happens when
this happens? I hit him? What'll he do?

1305
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,715
He does this!

1306
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,029
Hey!

1307
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,195
Hey!

1308
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,309
Hey!

1309
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:51,718
I didn't even hit you.

1310
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:54,989
- 'Cause you like me?
- Come on, let's go in the ring.

1311
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:56,348
- I know what to do now, Al.
- You sure?

1312
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,674
- Yeah.
- Come on.

1313
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,155
You let me know how the fight turns out.

1314
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,794
- Come on.
- Good luck, Melvin.

1315
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,833
Boy, is this gonna be a slaughter.

1316
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,439
Come on, let's go, Melvin.

1317
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,752
Get in through here.

1318
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,799
Oh, I'm sorry, kid. Come on, get up.

1319
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:29,070
What for?
I'll be back down here in a minute.

1320
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,112
He hasn't got a chance against us.

1321
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:33,912
We'll lick him. We'll murder him.

1322
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,871
Gee, I wish we had this fight
in the hospital

1323
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,479
so I could be nearer the medicine.

1324
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,594
Oh, look!

1325
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,955
That's not the guy
I was supposed to fight.

1326
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,752
Well, maybe
the other guy didn't feel good.

1327
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:50,553
- I don't feel good, either.
- Oh, Melvin, after all,

1328
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,318
if it wasrt all right,
he wouldn't be in there.

1329
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:53,873
They have rules, you know.

1330
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,113
Everybody makes rules
how I should get beat up.

1331
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,800
The next bout presenting
four rounds of boxing.

1332
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:04,674
In this corner at 137 and a quarter,
Melvin Jones!

1333
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:21,759
And his opponent in this corner
at 175 pounds,

1334
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,108
Killer Jackson!

1335
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,157
You werert the guy
that was mad at me.

1336
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,599
That was me kid brother.

1337
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:34,109
We heard you was a pro,
so I'm substituting.

1338
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:37,312
That's enough talk, boys.
Now, I want a good, clean fight.

1339
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:40,113
Anyone knocked down,
I want you to go to a neutral corner.

1340
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:43,279
No rabbit punches,
no hitting below the belt.

1341
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:45,471
And keep your thumbs in.

1342
01:22:45,680 --> 01:22:47,238
Shake hands now, go to your corners

1343
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:48,679
and come out fighting.

1344
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,556
Remember, we're gonna give him
everything we got.

1345
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,917
- What's that for?
- He said no hitting below the belt.

1346
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,075
Come on, put that back in.

1347
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:01,519
Now remember, we're going to give him
the old one-two.

1348
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,232
- Open your mouth.
- What's that for?

1349
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,430
That's so if he hits us,
he won't knock our teeth out.

1350
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:06,754
Knock our teeth out.

1351
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,275
Look at that.

1352
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,189
One, two,

1353
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,471
three, four, five.

1354
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:27,159
I wasrt ready.

1355
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,191
Melvin, get up!

1356
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:04,393
Three, four, five, six.

1357
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:05,748
Foul, foul.

1358
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,836
- Let's go, Jones.
- Where we going?

1359
01:24:07,960 --> 01:24:09,234
Quit stalling and get in and mix it up.

1360
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:12,431
- Foul.
- Quit stalling.

1361
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:14,710
- Get in and mix it up.
- Foul!

1362
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:39,751
Melvin, wake up here. Wake up.

1363
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:43,350
It's so nice here.
Just the two of us in the moonlight.

1364
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,118
All alone.

1365
01:25:47,240 --> 01:25:49,595
And by the ocean.

1366
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:53,111
Come on. There, we'll get him this time.

1367
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:00,513
Get up here and fight!

1368
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,837
- I have my own strategy.
- Go on in that corner.

1369
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:07,873
One, two, three, four.

1370
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:09,558
- Come on, Melvin!
- Five.

1371
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,112
Get up. Get up off the floor, Melvin.

1372
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,478
Melvin, get up!

1373
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:50,870
Look, Melvin, get up off the floor!

1374
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:55,674
Come on, Melvin, let's go.

1375
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:24,595
One,

1376
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:28,030
two, three, four, five,

1377
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:32,119
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

1378
01:27:36,280 --> 01:27:37,998
Oh, I didn't mean to do it.

1379
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,515
Atta boy, atta boy, Melvin.

1380
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,598
- I hope he's not mad at me.
- Oh, I thought for a while he had us,

1381
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:52,314
but we took care of him.
Come on, let's get in the dressing room.

1382
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,589
Come on, Melvin.
Watch your step here now.

1383
01:27:57,160 --> 01:27:58,513
Watch it.

1384
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:01,233
How do you feel?

1385
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,397
I could go another 10 rounds.

1386
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,829
Atta boy. How about that fight, huh?

1387
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,238
How do you like that?

1388
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:16,275
Hey, maybe I'd better go in and check
and see what lover boy is doing.

1389
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,994
Okay.
But don't go too far with those bets.

1390
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,553
- Don't worry.
- Hey, what gives?

1391
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:23,035
- I thought this thing was in the bag.
- Oh, it was just tough luck.

1392
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:25,071
I thought the Killer was gonna
take care of him.

1393
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,679
But now, it's up to you guys to see that

1394
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,836
he doesn't get to the party to
see Corinne.

1395
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:31,395
After all, you guys got dough
bet on him, too, you know.

1396
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,192
Sure, but what're we gonna do about it?

1397
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:35,959
- Just keep him out of circulation.
- How?

1398
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,150
Figure it out for yourselves.

1399
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:41,280
These ain't Red Cross armbands,
you know.

1400
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:42,835
Okay.

1401
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:47,029
Come on, Melvin,
we still have two hours to win that bet.

1402
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:48,149
Hey, Melvin.

1403
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,316
Some SPs are trying to keep you
from getting to that luau.

1404
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:52,715
- How do you know?
- Lardoski talked them into it.

1405
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,432
Let's get to the beach.
Corinne'll be there.

1406
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,437
- Come on, it's our only chance.
- Not that way, Al.

1407
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,393
- They're waiting outside.
- Then how am I gonna get out of here?

1408
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,272
Oh, no, fellas.

1409
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:05,550
Oh, come on, Melvin,
we haven't got much time.

1410
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:07,477
Well, they're gonna recognise me
like this.

1411
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,670
We'll figure out something
so they won't recognise you.

1412
01:29:10,040 --> 01:29:11,598
Upsy Daisy, that's it.

1413
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,951
Look at that bunch of wolves.

1414
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:41,594
- And I want to get thrown to them.
- Oh, now, wait a minute.

1415
01:29:41,720 --> 01:29:43,676
Remember what I told you
about sailors?

1416
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,028
I remember.

1417
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:46,878
Why do you think
I want to get thrown to them?

1418
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,553
Never before

1419
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:58,272
Has my heart felt a thrill like this

1420
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:01,470
Never before

1421
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,673
Never before

1422
01:30:09,960 --> 01:30:13,157
Never before

1423
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:17,398
Has the whole world stood still like this

1424
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:21,710
As I gaze at the face

1425
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,310
I simply adore

1426
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,834
After today

1427
01:30:32,440 --> 01:30:36,911
When they speak about paradise

1428
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:41,550
Ill smile and Ill say

1429
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:43,951
Ive been there

1430
01:30:44,080 --> 01:30:47,470
Once or twice

1431
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:54,071
For this is that once in a lifetime

1432
01:30:54,640 --> 01:30:59,350
The miracle of your kiss

1433
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:03,715
Ive never loved like this

1434
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:09,515
Never before

1435
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:17,000
His singing kind of gets you. I mean...

1436
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,554
I know what you mean. It gets me, too.

1437
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:23,830
- I like him when he sings.
- Were you listening?

1438
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:25,552
It was nice.

1439
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:28,274
I hope you didn't think I was rude
in the Mango Room.

1440
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:30,159
Oh, I can easily forget all about it

1441
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:31,759
if you'll take a stroll with me
down along the beach.

1442
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:34,030
I thought this was a public appearance.

1443
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:36,390
It is. He's my public.

1444
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:48,431
I don't see why the chief needs
so many men

1445
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,869
- just to catch one poor guy.
- Neither do I.

1446
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:52,558
Drop us off here, fella.

1447
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,514
Drop off, very quick. Chop, chop.

1448
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:03,751
- I'm glad I changed my mind.
- You mean about hating sailors?

1449
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:06,269
Well, you can't blame a girl
for being cautious.

1450
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:09,233
- After all, how do I know when...
- When you're in love?

1451
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:12,079
- Now, wait a minute. I didn't say that.
- Well, you shouldn't.

1452
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:13,838
I ought to bring it up first.

1453
01:32:13,960 --> 01:32:16,554
You see, a guy says,
"All my life I've been waiting for you."

1454
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:18,750
The girl says, "You have?"
He says, "Yeah."

1455
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:20,313
Before you know it, you're in love.

1456
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:23,637
And I know, because all my life
I've been waiting for someone like you.

1457
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:26,752
- You have?
- Stop. Don't kiss him. Don't kiss him.

1458
01:32:26,880 --> 01:32:29,189
- Why?
- I just heard tonight there's a bet on

1459
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:31,880
that a certain sailor will kiss you,
and half the fleet's in on it.

1460
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,672
Who could resist kissing you?

1461
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,119
I'm so sorry.

1462
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:37,515
You almost won
a lot of money for your sailor friends.

1463
01:32:37,640 --> 01:32:39,039
Kissing me? Now, wait a minute.

1464
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:40,718
Too bad,
you are just like the rest of them.

1465
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,309
- Corinne, look...
- Stay out of my way, will you?

1466
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:45,593
That's for all you men.

1467
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:06,956
Very quick, very quick. Chop, chop.

1468
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:18,797
- Aloha.
- Same to you.

1469
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:45,197
- Have you seen anything of Jones?
- Nope.

1470
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:48,357
Nobody went by me
but one of them Hawaiian dancers.

1471
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,754
Which one?

1472
01:35:50,160 --> 01:35:51,275
That one.

1473
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:02,759
It's Melvin.

1474
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,716
- That's Melvin.
- That's Jones.

1475
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,874
Shore patrol, shore patrol! Come on.

1476
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:39,793
Run for it! They can't catch us.
Come on, run!

1477
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,592
We can run faster than that.

1478
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:45,110
Run, Melvin, run! Atta boy! Run!

1479
01:37:48,840 --> 01:37:51,308
- Leave me alone.
- Stop it. All of you.

1480
01:37:51,440 --> 01:37:54,113
Arert you ashamed of yourselves
running after this little boy?

1481
01:37:54,240 --> 01:37:55,719
- Leave him alone.
- But he was

1482
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,956
out of uniform and disturbing the peace.

1483
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:00,150
He was entertaining the guests.

1484
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,793
This is a party.

1485
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:03,876
Are you hurt, little boy?

1486
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:08,430
She kissed me! I won the bet!

1487
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:11,679
- I won the bet!
- Sure.

1488
01:38:11,800 --> 01:38:13,199
You mean it wasrt Al?

1489
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,470
No, they were betting I could kiss you.

1490
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:17,352
Oh, you don't know how glad I am.

1491
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:19,198
I could really kiss you for telling me this.

1492
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:21,754
- Then what're you waiting for?
- All right.

1493
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:26,399
Yay, Melvin!

1494
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:29,029
- Hey.
- Oh, we won the bet, Al!

1495
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:32,749
We won.

1496
01:38:40,360 --> 01:38:42,112
Gee, when you kiss me, I like it.

1497
01:38:42,440 --> 01:38:44,396
The other girls inflame my uvula.

1498
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:47,950
Hurry it up, men. We're shoving off.

1499
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,672
- Look, honey, we can't hold up the Navy.
- Wait a minute, Al.

1500
01:38:56,480 --> 01:38:58,391
That'll hold you for four years.
So long, sugar.

1501
01:38:58,520 --> 01:39:01,796
Why, you no good two-timer.
That's the same thing you told me.

1502
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:05,516
Hey, Mel! Come on, Melvin.

1503
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:07,596
- Go!
