1
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,540
Marvellous salad.

2
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:56,795
Marvellous.
May I have a bit more, please?

3
00:02:56,964 --> 00:02:58,755
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, me too.

4
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:01,696
Count me in. It is divine.

5
00:03:07,558 --> 00:03:11,556
- Tell Sissie everything is excellent.
- She'll be pleased.

6
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:16,355
And I'll have a little fraction more
of that wonderful salad.

7
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:17,556
Yes, ma'am.

8
00:03:21,614 --> 00:03:23,405
Is it ready?

9
00:03:28,287 --> 00:03:31,074
- It needs more oregano.
- I put a lot in.

10
00:03:31,248 --> 00:03:33,537
Well, just a touch more.

11
00:03:36,754 --> 00:03:40,087
- Where did you get this?
- Out of your bag.

12
00:03:40,257 --> 00:03:43,709
That's not my bag.
That's the waiter's bag.

13
00:03:44,553 --> 00:03:48,136
Four more salads
for four very hungry people who--

14
00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:51,557
- What's wrong, Mavis?
- Harry, what is this?

15
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:57,730
That's personal.

16
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,857
What is it?

17
00:04:00,694 --> 00:04:04,063
- It ain't oregano.
- Oh, my God!

18
00:04:04,907 --> 00:04:08,157
- You put this in the veal?
- And the soup.

19
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:10,865
- No!
- And the salad.

20
00:04:11,038 --> 00:04:14,288
Lord have mercy! Grass!

21
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,745
My grass!

22
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,039
Jesus! You cooked half my stash!

23
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:27,420
Excuse me, dear.
May I talk with you for a minute?

24
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:29,719
- Up your kazoo!
- Up my.... Wait.

25
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,555
I'm not trying to be a pest.
I know you're an actress.

26
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:36,812
- Who are you?
- Skip Donahue. I'm a playwright.

27
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:39,851
I saw you do a scene
from Romeo and Juliet.

28
00:04:40,025 --> 00:04:44,853
You were wonderful. I'm not just
saying it to be kind. You were lovely.

29
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,649
Get out of my way
or I'll kick you in the nuts.

30
00:04:48,826 --> 00:04:54,698
Kick in the nuts! You're fantastic.
The way you can switch characters.

31
00:04:54,874 --> 00:04:58,325
The difference between this
and Juliet is fabulous.

32
00:04:58,502 --> 00:05:02,037
I know you're not wearing
anything under that coat.

33
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:05,548
- What?
- I also know you're a shoplifter.

34
00:05:05,718 --> 00:05:08,884
- Part-time.
- Are you some kind of loony tune?

35
00:05:09,054 --> 00:05:13,218
No. I'm the store detective here.
Part-time.

36
00:05:17,146 --> 00:05:20,479
Mrs. R.H. was my best customer too.

37
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:25,477
Well, I was James' best customer.
He sold me this African gungi '65.

38
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:30,281
Do you know what you've done?
For a little of this, my girlfriend...

39
00:05:30,492 --> 00:05:34,324
...was gonna let me have her
and two of her girlfriends.

40
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:37,332
She'll ruin me when she finds out!

41
00:05:37,499 --> 00:05:40,500
- Maybe she'll think it's the wine.
- The wine?

42
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:44,334
There's no wine in the world that--
Smell that.

43
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:47,875
This is '65 African gungi
from the motherland.

44
00:05:48,052 --> 00:05:52,548
Understand? It's been soaked
in the earth back home. This is mean!

45
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:57,718
One joint of this put Southern
California to sleep back in '65.

46
00:05:57,895 --> 00:06:02,058
There was a revolution in '65.
We missed it because of this.

47
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:06,147
This is bad! And you went
and spread it over everything.

48
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,274
I hope you had fun,
because I ain't gonna.

49
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:13,909
I saw you pretend to steal that dress.
You even looked guilty.

50
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:17,447
You're a wonderful actress.
But you didn't know...

51
00:06:17,623 --> 00:06:22,415
...l also saw you take off the dress
and throw it in the trash bin.

52
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:25,288
Let me get this right...

53
00:06:25,464 --> 00:06:26,875
...shithead!

54
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:30,009
You kill me.

55
00:06:30,177 --> 00:06:33,760
- You think I was a terrific Juliet--
- You were!

56
00:06:33,931 --> 00:06:39,222
Thanks. And you think that I stole
a dress, and then threw it away!

57
00:06:39,395 --> 00:06:42,645
- Right!
- You think I have nothing on under this?

58
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:45,567
I know that you don't.

59
00:06:55,244 --> 00:06:57,865
- More wine, sir?
- What is this stuff?

60
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:01,538
- Domestic '65. Hot, isn't it?
- Was that a good year?

61
00:07:01,709 --> 00:07:03,951
- The best ever.
- It's a bitch.

62
00:07:04,128 --> 00:07:07,378
- What did you say?
- I didn't say nothing, ma'am.

63
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,922
- I'm feeling something very strange.
- That's my leg.

64
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:21,142
Oh, that's all right.
Hit him again, Harry.

65
00:07:21,312 --> 00:07:24,478
Yes, ma'am.
Hitting you again, Father.

66
00:07:24,648 --> 00:07:28,397
You know, I've never
felt like this before.

67
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:30,941
You know, I'm.... I'm....

68
00:07:31,113 --> 00:07:32,691
Horny?

69
00:07:32,865 --> 00:07:34,739
- Yes?
- Which reminds me.

70
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:40,199
There's something I always wanted to
ask someone like you. Do you get much?

71
00:07:40,372 --> 00:07:44,702
Not too often.
Just an occasional glass at dinner.

72
00:07:44,877 --> 00:07:47,498
That's not what she meant.

73
00:08:26,335 --> 00:08:28,126
- Harry.
- Yes, yes, yes.

74
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:31,130
The most wonderful thing
just happened.

75
00:08:31,298 --> 00:08:32,923
Me too.

76
00:08:36,637 --> 00:08:40,053
She's bad, ain't she?
What are you laughing for?

77
00:08:40,224 --> 00:08:42,929
Harry, I got fired today.

78
00:08:43,102 --> 00:08:45,557
- I got fired too.
- What do you mean?

79
00:08:45,729 --> 00:08:47,687
- I got fired.
- You got fired?

80
00:08:47,857 --> 00:08:49,979
Today? This afternoon?

81
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,309
- Yep.
- Between 3:30 and 4?

82
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:55,820
Yeah, about that.
What happened? I win a prize?

83
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,445
Harry. This is fantastic!

84
00:08:58,617 --> 00:09:03,160
- Any deaths we can celebrate too?
- Don't you know what I'm saying?

85
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,406
- Skip.
- Hi, Nancy.

86
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,583
- How you doing, honey?
- How you doing, Nancy?

87
00:09:08,752 --> 00:09:11,588
- I'm sitting back there.
- Nancy, hello.

88
00:09:11,755 --> 00:09:15,207
- Okay.
- Harry-- You don't introduce me?

89
00:09:15,384 --> 00:09:18,005
- She's not for you.
- What do you mean?

90
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:20,634
- Nancy is a fascinating girl.
- Yeah.

91
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:24,638
She may be the single hottest girl
on the East Side.

92
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:28,724
But when you wake up,
you'll find she's not very serious.

93
00:09:28,898 --> 00:09:30,855
Neither am l.

94
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:33,397
Harry, listen to me.

95
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:37,780
For the first time in our lives,
we're free.

96
00:09:37,948 --> 00:09:41,234
Yeah, free to walk in the cold.
To be ridiculed.

97
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,988
I don't mean that.

98
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:47,871
I mean we're free to get out
of this city. It's driving me buggy.

99
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,373
What are you trying to pull?

100
00:09:50,544 --> 00:09:53,166
I gave you a $10 bill.
Think I'm crazy?

101
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:55,580
And it's 8:50 on the clock. Okay?

102
00:09:55,758 --> 00:09:59,590
- You gave me a buck, not 10.
- Bullshit! I gave you a 10!

103
00:09:59,762 --> 00:10:04,969
- Why are you trying to steal from me?
- Get lost, Chico.

104
00:10:06,602 --> 00:10:10,765
See what this city does to people?
They need room to breathe.

105
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,016
They need love, affection!

106
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:18,648
The little guy needs money. The big
guy needs a two-by-four to his head.

107
00:10:18,822 --> 00:10:23,734
All they need is someone to talk
to them gently, with compassion.

108
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:27,494
- That's all they need.
- Are you serious? Huh?

109
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:31,330
I'm serious. That's what
I don't like about this city.

110
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:33,993
- You're a saint.
- Why make fun of me?

111
00:10:34,171 --> 00:10:38,667
You ought to go over there.
They're gentlemen, they'll understand.

112
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:44,513
Because you convinced me. Go on over
there, tell them what you told me.

113
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,762
Go on over there.

114
00:10:52,481 --> 00:10:55,268
- Okay.
- Skip, what are you--? Skip!

115
00:10:55,442 --> 00:10:58,313
Skip, don't go over there, man.

116
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:02,104
- Skip.
- Oh, hi, Lana.

117
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:11,537
Call me.

118
00:11:12,084 --> 00:11:14,836
Excuse me.
Hold on one second, fellas.

119
00:11:15,004 --> 00:11:17,958
Listen, I know this
is a delicate situation.

120
00:11:18,132 --> 00:11:20,539
But let's talk a little sense.

121
00:11:20,718 --> 00:11:23,090
Do you really want
to hurt this man?

122
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:24,970
No, no, not at all.

123
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:27,677
Do you want more
than what you're due?

124
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,471
- No.
- Then we're halfway home.

125
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:33,515
Can we work this out
in a civilized manner?

126
00:11:33,689 --> 00:11:35,183
It's okay with me.

127
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:39,857
By the way, sir, what is your name?

128
00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:43,483
Alex.

129
00:11:44,033 --> 00:11:46,405
Alex. And you, sir?

130
00:11:46,577 --> 00:11:49,447
- My name is Chico.
- Chico.

131
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:55,080
Alex, may I present Chico.
Chico, this is Alex.

132
00:11:55,252 --> 00:11:57,044
How do you do?

133
00:12:00,507 --> 00:12:03,081
Wallet. Wallet.

134
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,882
Okay. Okay.

135
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:11,477
- Here. Here.
- Hey, thanks, sir.

136
00:12:11,644 --> 00:12:15,226
- Does this include the tip?
- Yes. Have it all. Okay?

137
00:12:15,397 --> 00:12:16,856
Thanks a lot.

138
00:12:17,024 --> 00:12:20,725
I'll leave you. You seem
to have a friendship starting.

139
00:12:20,903 --> 00:12:23,358
- Have a nice evening.
- Thank you.

140
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:26,366
- So long, fellas.
- So long.

141
00:12:26,575 --> 00:12:28,200
Take care.

142
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:32,821
No, no, don't. That--

143
00:12:40,923 --> 00:12:43,628
- Well?
- What if you got hurt, huh?

144
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:45,509
Did you think about that?

145
00:12:45,678 --> 00:12:51,882
Do you see what can be accomplished
if you get people to make real contact?

146
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:56,638
The little man had the contact.
He got his point across.

147
00:12:56,814 --> 00:13:00,598
Harry, I don't like it here anymore.
I want to get out.

148
00:13:00,776 --> 00:13:03,350
Let's go where there's some sunshine.

149
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:07,479
Where there's human feelings.
Tenderness and kindness.

150
00:13:07,658 --> 00:13:12,783
- Where the noise is not so loud.
- You wanna leave New York? Broadway?

151
00:13:12,955 --> 00:13:14,414
You love New York?

152
00:13:14,582 --> 00:13:18,994
I got a callback on a play.
I'm an actor. I'm going to stay.

153
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:24,460
Harry, you made $35
last year as an actor.

154
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,502
- How much you make as a playwright?
- Nothing.

155
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:33,507
That's why I want to get out of here.
Let's go. We can head out West.

156
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:37,468
We could grab odd jobs on the way.
Build up a nest egg.

157
00:13:37,646 --> 00:13:42,807
And then head for Hollywood.
That's the place for us. Picture it.

158
00:13:42,985 --> 00:13:45,274
Harry and Skip in the Sunbelt.

159
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:49,859
In the Sunbelt, you just smile
and they pour money out on you.

160
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:53,948
And the women. Oh, God, the women.

161
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:59,040
Natural, robust, open, carefree...

162
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:02,210
...uninhibited, healthy.

163
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:05,131
- Talk some more.
- Okay.

164
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:08,051
- You can talk shit.
- Okay, picture this.

165
00:14:08,219 --> 00:14:13,094
You and me, and two girls.
Romping through the desert.

166
00:14:13,265 --> 00:14:16,930
Splashing into the ocean.
And the moonlight is out.

167
00:14:17,102 --> 00:14:21,396
We glimpse their bodies
when the moonlight hits their breasts.

168
00:14:21,565 --> 00:14:24,899
We watch those breasts
bounce gently to and fro.

169
00:14:25,069 --> 00:14:28,485
- In the sand?
- After the water, we go in the sand.

170
00:14:28,656 --> 00:14:30,862
- We have a blanket.
- You serious?

171
00:14:31,033 --> 00:14:33,904
- That's what I'm trying to say.
- Let's go!

172
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:36,699
Okay! California, here I come!

173
00:15:28,215 --> 00:15:30,540
Harry, what's the matter?

174
00:15:33,387 --> 00:15:35,296
- 150 bucks?
- 150?

175
00:15:35,472 --> 00:15:37,845
That'll put a dent in our bankroll.

176
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:41,386
Don't worry.
Jobs shouldn't be hard to find here.

177
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:44,017
I think this is too much, though.

178
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:47,356
I have a good feeling
about this town.

179
00:15:47,568 --> 00:15:50,320
I think this is gonna be
our lucky town.

180
00:15:50,487 --> 00:15:52,943
Give me the 5 back, please.

181
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,907
Merry Christmas.

182
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:42,451
- How did you do on the job front?
- I drew a blank.

183
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:47,451
Well, I have one possibility.
It's nothing ideal. But it's a start.

184
00:16:47,628 --> 00:16:51,791
Harry, I have something
very important to tell you.

185
00:16:52,091 --> 00:16:55,376
I love this place!
I'm thrilled here, Harry.

186
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:58,637
I'm telling you, I am....
I'm thrilled.

187
00:16:58,806 --> 00:17:02,389
- I'm thrilled for you.
- You can taste the atmosphere.

188
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,596
Do you know what this will do
for my writing?

189
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:07,771
See those two guys?

190
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,143
The Sunbelt's history
is written on their faces.

191
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:13,644
- They'll bring your hat to you.
- Don't worry.

192
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:19,064
I'd love to talk with those fellows. I
want to try and capture their rhythm.

193
00:17:19,243 --> 00:17:23,323
- It won't take you long. Skip--
- I'll be right back.

194
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:26,617
Jesus Christ, goddamn! Skip!

195
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:32,290
Hi. Hi, fellas.

196
00:17:33,007 --> 00:17:36,210
Hello. Hi. How are you?

197
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:39,671
I'm Skip Donahue. I'm from back East.

198
00:17:39,847 --> 00:17:43,845
Me and my buddy--
My buddy and I just rolled into town.

199
00:17:44,018 --> 00:17:48,265
We were wondering, what is the job
situation like around here?

200
00:17:48,898 --> 00:17:52,101
Wow! That surprised me.
Do you mind if I try it?

201
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,691
Okay.

202
00:18:21,388 --> 00:18:22,764
Skip!

203
00:18:23,766 --> 00:18:27,716
Excuse me, gentlemen,
I just want to speak to my friend.

204
00:18:27,895 --> 00:18:31,478
- What?
- Socializing with them is hazardous.

205
00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:34,852
- They're nice guys.
- They'll take your head off.

206
00:18:35,027 --> 00:18:39,321
- Tell me about the job opportunity.
- It's in banking.

207
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:42,989
- We don't know about banking.
- We don't have to.

208
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,992
I've sold the manager
on a new promotion idea.

209
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,576
Oh, you'll save money
Knock on wood

210
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:54,202
When you do what
A good woodpecker should

211
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,250
Save for a horse
Or a brand-new ranch

212
00:18:57,424 --> 00:19:01,125
When you flock to the
Glenboro Savings branch

213
00:19:01,303 --> 00:19:04,672
You can feather your nest
With frills

214
00:19:04,849 --> 00:19:08,264
Fill your garage
With Coup de Villes

215
00:19:08,435 --> 00:19:12,219
Just relax if you have a big bill

216
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:14,604
Are you really a woodpecker?

217
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:18,109
No, I'm just a man pretending
to be a woodpecker.

218
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:20,770
That's a real woodpecker.

219
00:19:22,783 --> 00:19:26,318
Be a smart bird too

220
00:19:26,495 --> 00:19:29,947
You little pecker, you

221
00:19:34,795 --> 00:19:39,671
You gotta admit, for an interim gig,
this really wasn't bad.

222
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:43,092
Oh, you'll save money
Knock on wood

223
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:02,860
You'll save money
Knock on wood

224
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:05,986
When you do what
A good woodpecker should

225
00:20:06,452 --> 00:20:09,239
Save for a horse
Or a brand-new ranch

226
00:20:09,413 --> 00:20:12,996
When you flock to the
Glenboro Savings--

227
00:20:16,003 --> 00:20:18,541
Get down on the floor.

228
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:48,944
Stay where you are
and nobody gets hurt.

229
00:21:23,988 --> 00:21:26,526
- Looks like trouble.
- What happened?

230
00:21:26,782 --> 00:21:29,736
- Let's not find out.
- It might be important.

231
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,239
Skip!

232
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:43,548
Would you mind looking
at some mug shots?

233
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:46,420
Maybe you can identify those guys.

234
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:52,214
- There they are! The New Yorkers!
- Can we help?

235
00:21:52,391 --> 00:21:54,218
Is that your van?

236
00:21:55,102 --> 00:21:59,515
- No, sir. It doesn't belong to me.
- Yes, sir. What are you doing?

237
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:04,103
- This is my first frisk.
- Why are you searching me?

238
00:22:04,278 --> 00:22:08,276
- I hope you're enjoying this shit.
- What are you doing?

239
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:14,443
Welcome to the desert.
But I don't see no naked women.

240
00:22:14,622 --> 00:22:16,863
I shouldn't have listened to you.

241
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:20,125
- Grandma was right. Shit for brains!
- Me?

242
00:22:20,294 --> 00:22:21,954
No, me!

243
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:30,335
- What are you doing?
- Getting bad.

244
00:22:30,513 --> 00:22:34,261
You better get bad.
If you ain't, you'll get fucked.

245
00:22:34,433 --> 00:22:37,434
You bad, they don't mess with you.

246
00:22:38,812 --> 00:22:42,063
- Hey, home, get down.
- Hey.

247
00:22:42,942 --> 00:22:45,480
You a little too bad, ain't you?

248
00:22:45,736 --> 00:22:47,278
Yeah.

249
00:22:47,988 --> 00:22:50,064
Do some of these.

250
00:23:03,754 --> 00:23:06,790
That's right, that's right, we bad.

251
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:11,213
That's right. We don't want
no shit, either. That's right.

252
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:12,881
Darn right.

253
00:23:13,305 --> 00:23:16,259
We don't want no shit, you understand?

254
00:23:16,433 --> 00:23:21,510
We don't take too much shit.
We take a little, but no monster shit.

255
00:23:21,689 --> 00:23:23,183
Damn right!

256
00:23:23,357 --> 00:23:26,026
- That's right. Say, "No shit."
- No shit!

257
00:23:26,193 --> 00:23:29,313
That's right, no shit. No.
Try it again.

258
00:23:29,488 --> 00:23:31,777
- We don't take no shit.
- No shit.

259
00:23:31,949 --> 00:23:33,657
No shit.

260
00:23:34,243 --> 00:23:38,537
- And we ain't shitting.
- You better believe it, baby.

261
00:24:11,238 --> 00:24:13,908
What the hell's wrong with him?

262
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:23,121
Oh, shit. Skip?
Skip, come on, man.

263
00:24:25,836 --> 00:24:27,580
Come on.

264
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:41,423
Carry me back to old Virginia, Lord.

265
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:43,393
Did you get it?

266
00:24:46,398 --> 00:24:49,565
Oh. There it is.

267
00:24:49,735 --> 00:24:53,649
Right on the end of your nose.

268
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:20,219
Sinsemilla!

269
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,852
Oh, shit!

270
00:25:36,824 --> 00:25:38,900
Give him a light.

271
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:43,818
- Give me a light.
- He wants a light.

272
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:49,495
Right on.

273
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:52,204
The man wants a light.

274
00:25:53,424 --> 00:25:54,799
A light.

275
00:26:04,185 --> 00:26:07,803
It doesn't....
Don't.... Just doesn't....

276
00:26:09,565 --> 00:26:11,890
Oh, shit.

277
00:26:12,985 --> 00:26:15,523
Oh, shit.

278
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,780
- Short-ass son of a bitch, ain't you?
- Oh, I'm a short son of a bitch.

279
00:26:23,954 --> 00:26:27,074
My father was a short
son of a bitch too.

280
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:29,823
My mother was shorter than him.

281
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:35,245
And my brother was real short, and we
couldn't even see him. He was short.

282
00:26:35,424 --> 00:26:38,129
- What's the charge?
- I'm innocent.

283
00:26:38,302 --> 00:26:40,840
- Ain't we all.
- Bank robbery.

284
00:26:41,597 --> 00:26:44,882
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit!

285
00:26:45,726 --> 00:26:48,431
You can kiss the baby.

286
00:26:50,314 --> 00:26:52,105
Kiss the baby?

287
00:26:52,775 --> 00:26:54,435
What baby is that, sir?

288
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,520
Ask your lawyer.

289
00:26:56,695 --> 00:26:58,735
Kiss the baby?

290
00:26:59,782 --> 00:27:00,944
- Hi.
- Hi.

291
00:27:01,116 --> 00:27:04,236
- I'm Slowpoke.
- Hi. Slowpoke, this is Harry.

292
00:27:04,411 --> 00:27:08,575
This state gives long sentences,
especially for bank robbing.

293
00:27:08,749 --> 00:27:12,794
Don't wet your pants. They have
a liberal good-time program.

294
00:27:12,962 --> 00:27:15,749
If the bottom drops out
from under you...

295
00:27:15,965 --> 00:27:19,084
...that's one bright spot
to look forward to.

296
00:27:20,719 --> 00:27:24,385
- Okay. Okay.
- What is he talking about?

297
00:27:24,557 --> 00:27:27,641
- What did he say?
- I don't know what he said.

298
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,597
He said if the bottom falls out.

299
00:27:30,771 --> 00:27:36,062
This filthy, roach-ridden reality
is inspiring.

300
00:27:38,362 --> 00:27:41,731
What did that cop say
when he grabbed your throat?

301
00:27:41,907 --> 00:27:46,071
- I don't fucking believe you!
- "I don't fucking believe you."

302
00:27:46,245 --> 00:27:48,487
- Fabulous!
- You don't get it.

303
00:27:48,664 --> 00:27:51,618
Think this is
The Count of Monte Cristo?

304
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:55,042
This is the real deal.
We're in deep shit.

305
00:27:55,212 --> 00:27:58,913
You and I are innocent.
You know that. I know that.

306
00:27:59,091 --> 00:28:03,468
The two guys who really pulled
that bank job know it too.

307
00:28:03,637 --> 00:28:05,760
But the cops don't know it!

308
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:08,054
Donahue. Monroe.

309
00:28:08,225 --> 00:28:12,721
- I am entitled to a private interview.
- Forget it.

310
00:28:17,526 --> 00:28:20,100
- Are you here for us?
- I believe so.

311
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:23,648
I'm Skip Donahue.
This is my buddy, Harry Monroe.

312
00:28:23,824 --> 00:28:27,738
- I'm Len Garber, your lawyer.
- It's a pleasure to see you.

313
00:28:27,912 --> 00:28:32,159
Call my girlfriend, Cindy Laurence.
They won't let me.

314
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:34,456
- It's important to him.
- I will.

315
00:28:34,627 --> 00:28:38,671
- Say we're at our cousins.
- There's been a misunderstanding.

316
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:42,006
I am more or less familiar
with the case.

317
00:28:42,176 --> 00:28:44,050
You know we're innocent?

318
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,339
Can't you just cut through
all this garbage?

319
00:28:47,515 --> 00:28:50,883
This isn't funny.
Do they know I hate confinement?

320
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:56,350
They don't care. I can only shower
them with motions. I've filed two.

321
00:28:56,524 --> 00:28:59,097
- Only two?
- How about a dozen on me?

322
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:01,898
We're dealing with robbery
and assault.

323
00:29:02,071 --> 00:29:04,941
You might as well have
burned the Pentagon!

324
00:29:06,575 --> 00:29:08,983
Will the defendants rise?

325
00:29:10,579 --> 00:29:14,363
Considering the arguments
presented by both counsel...

326
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:16,790
...and after deliberation...

327
00:29:16,961 --> 00:29:20,412
...l find the defendants
guilty as charged.

328
00:29:20,589 --> 00:29:24,421
Do you wish to waive the right
to a pre-sentence hearing?

329
00:29:24,593 --> 00:29:26,052
- No.
- Yes, Your Honour.

330
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,636
Considering the ruthless nature
of this crime...

331
00:29:29,807 --> 00:29:33,010
...and the bleak prospects
for rehabilitation...

332
00:29:33,185 --> 00:29:36,768
...l hereby sentence you
to serve 125 years...

333
00:29:36,939 --> 00:29:42,064
...in the custody of the commissioner
of the Department of Corrections.

334
00:29:44,154 --> 00:29:46,361
Wait. No, no, no, wait.

335
00:29:46,532 --> 00:29:48,026
No, no, sit. Sit.

336
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,154
We didn't do it.
There's a misunderstanding.

337
00:29:51,328 --> 00:29:53,238
- Right.
- We didn't do it.

338
00:29:53,414 --> 00:29:57,032
- Our lawyer told us to come up--
- I know I didn't.

339
00:29:57,209 --> 00:30:01,159
He's joking. He means we didn't do it.
We didn't do it.

340
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:05,383
- Have you got the right case?
- This is Monroe and Donahue.

341
00:30:05,551 --> 00:30:10,343
- Harry Monroe. Look under there.
- Sir.

342
00:30:10,514 --> 00:30:13,184
- A tall, black man--
- Sir, we didn't--

343
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:16,470
How much does that mean
in actual time?

344
00:30:16,645 --> 00:30:19,682
- Thirty years, tops.
- I'll be a dead old man.

345
00:30:19,857 --> 00:30:23,190
- Thirty years.
- I don't want to do one.

346
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,812
I don't even want to do 100.
I can't....

347
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:29,112
I'm gonna kill this mother.

348
00:30:31,327 --> 00:30:35,538
- I'm mad about what happened.
- It's not the end of the world.

349
00:30:35,706 --> 00:30:39,075
- What do we do?
- Start your sentence. I'll appeal.

350
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:43,794
- A hundred and twenty-five years!
- Stop it! It's only 30 years.

351
00:30:44,006 --> 00:30:49,427
Can you get your staff to track down
those guys who really pulled it off?

352
00:30:49,595 --> 00:30:54,008
It's a one-man show. My cousin
is visiting from Massachusetts.

353
00:30:54,183 --> 00:30:56,804
She's a terrific social worker.
Bright.

354
00:30:56,977 --> 00:30:59,978
Oh, 125 years.
I won't have grandchildren!

355
00:31:30,886 --> 00:31:32,297
Thanks.

356
00:31:45,901 --> 00:31:50,231
It's chilling. It's frighteningly real.
It's almost surreal.

357
00:31:50,406 --> 00:31:54,700
Will you shut up until we get out
of this mess you got us into?

358
00:31:54,952 --> 00:31:57,906
Let's go. And no slow bucking.

359
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,125
- Sir, how come--?
- Shut up, asshole, and move out!

360
00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:13,756
This is from the Middle Ages.
How do they expect you to move?

361
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:16,681
I bet this whole thing is illegal.

362
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:21,310
- Sir, wasn't this whole contraption--?
- Keep moving, turkey!

363
00:32:21,478 --> 00:32:23,270
Get up. Get up!

364
00:32:24,773 --> 00:32:28,225
You're gonna have to learn
the hard way, fella.

365
00:32:29,612 --> 00:32:32,613
I was right.
This is illegal and he knows it.

366
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,907
Jesus! The man
ain't never gonna learn.

367
00:32:36,076 --> 00:32:38,864
Maybe after they hit him a few times.

368
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:42,952
Just get into the flow of it.
Don't fight the metal.

369
00:32:43,125 --> 00:32:45,082
I'm not. It's fighting me.

370
00:32:45,252 --> 00:32:50,329
- What you up for, Sweetpants?
- We're innocent. I swear we are.

371
00:32:50,507 --> 00:32:53,508
My name ain't no goddamn "Sweetpants."

372
00:32:53,677 --> 00:32:55,504
Holy shit!

373
00:32:58,015 --> 00:33:01,716
- I have the swing of it now. Thanks.
- Sure.

374
00:33:01,894 --> 00:33:04,302
- I'm Skip Donahue.
- Jesus Ramirez.

375
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,805
Nice to meet you.
Why are you here?

376
00:33:06,982 --> 00:33:10,932
I've been here seven years,
away from my beautiful Teresa.

377
00:33:11,111 --> 00:33:14,445
I was in court on an appeal hearing.
Lost again.

378
00:33:14,615 --> 00:33:17,367
They accused me
of robbing several banks.

379
00:33:17,535 --> 00:33:21,698
I was drunk, but I'm positive
I only robbed one bank. You?

380
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:25,075
My friend and I were doing
a song and dance act.

381
00:33:25,251 --> 00:33:27,658
Must have been pretty bad.

382
00:33:35,344 --> 00:33:38,962
Excuse me. I'm not very good
at these written tests.

383
00:33:39,139 --> 00:33:44,098
I think you'll get much more of my
original flavour in an oral exam--

384
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:48,599
You know, I'm just about to lose
my patience with you.

385
00:33:48,774 --> 00:33:52,724
- I was trying to explain--
- Keep writing, shitface!

386
00:33:57,491 --> 00:33:59,863
Two pears, three apples....

387
00:34:00,035 --> 00:34:04,947
Listen. A kid tried that on me once
at Camp Minikani in Vermont.

388
00:34:05,124 --> 00:34:09,335
I hit him so hard his braces
ripped his whole upper lip.

389
00:34:09,503 --> 00:34:13,501
His mother had to come get him
in the middle of the season.

390
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:34,776
- What do they put in the dollhouses?
- Guess.

391
00:34:34,945 --> 00:34:38,314
- Us?
- Yes. You got it on the first try.

392
00:34:38,616 --> 00:34:40,158
- Harry.
- What?

393
00:34:41,327 --> 00:34:44,743
- We're in prison.
- Welcome to the real world!

394
00:34:44,914 --> 00:34:49,955
And not a minute too soon,
I might add. Now, brace up. Be strong.

395
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,349
- Harry.
- What?

396
00:35:13,526 --> 00:35:16,277
I don't think I'm going to make it.

397
00:35:17,404 --> 00:35:21,354
Hang on, man. Don't mess up.
Just think about our appeal.

398
00:35:22,952 --> 00:35:25,240
Skip, please.

399
00:35:38,551 --> 00:35:40,590
Excuse me. Could I please--?

400
00:35:40,761 --> 00:35:43,928
Wait a minute,
I'm not a troublemaker.

401
00:35:46,225 --> 00:35:47,600
Skip.

402
00:35:53,274 --> 00:35:54,649
Skip!

403
00:35:55,943 --> 00:35:57,770
Okay, no more hitting.

404
00:35:57,945 --> 00:36:01,693
Did you hear what I said?
No more hitting. Turn around.

405
00:36:01,866 --> 00:36:04,403
Wanna stay late tonight?
Turn around.

406
00:36:04,577 --> 00:36:08,621
Let's get out of here!
Come on, Silver! Harry, I'm freaking.

407
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:11,161
Giddyap! So long, suckers!

408
00:36:11,333 --> 00:36:14,370
Hey, Harry, he thinks he's a horse.

409
00:36:14,545 --> 00:36:16,004
Help me! Harry!

410
00:36:16,171 --> 00:36:18,413
Don't hit him! Please, he's sick.

411
00:36:18,591 --> 00:36:22,719
He's having a fit.
He don't have his fit pills.

412
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:27,015
- He's got them, honest. Vietnam....
- Harry, help me, Harry!

413
00:36:27,183 --> 00:36:28,926
- Skip!
- Help!

414
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:33,183
Oh, shit, Skip.

415
00:36:39,737 --> 00:36:44,315
It's okay. It's okay.
You did it. You did it.

416
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:48,074
- He's okay now.
- I'm okay now. It's out of my system.

417
00:36:48,245 --> 00:36:49,490
- You okay?
- Yep.

418
00:36:49,663 --> 00:36:51,739
- He's okay.
- I'm 100 percent.

419
00:36:51,916 --> 00:36:53,576
Please, just this once.

420
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:56,668
I mean, it's okay. Pretend it's okay.

421
00:36:56,837 --> 00:36:58,248
Okay.

422
00:36:58,422 --> 00:37:00,747
- He's okay, see?
- Yeah, we're okay.

423
00:37:00,925 --> 00:37:03,213
- Okay?
- Yeah.

424
00:37:07,598 --> 00:37:10,801
For God's sake!
You're gonna get us in trouble.

425
00:37:10,976 --> 00:37:14,844
- Harry, it's all right.
- I can't take it! Mama!

426
00:37:15,022 --> 00:37:16,564
- Come here.
- Mama!

427
00:37:16,732 --> 00:37:20,066
Take your pill.
Three seconds, it's over.

428
00:37:20,236 --> 00:37:24,862
One thousand one. One thousand two.
One thousand three. Finished!

429
00:37:25,032 --> 00:37:27,072
Finished!

430
00:37:27,243 --> 00:37:30,576
What did I tell you?
Okay, let's go.

431
00:37:30,746 --> 00:37:33,747
Back in line. Here we go.
Thanks very much.

432
00:37:33,958 --> 00:37:38,620
- Okay! Here we go. What's next?
- This way.

433
00:37:45,553 --> 00:37:48,090
I'd like spareribs, French fries...

434
00:37:48,347 --> 00:37:53,223
...and a big old juicy cheeseburger
on the side with a chocolate malt!

435
00:37:53,477 --> 00:37:54,640
Thanks.

436
00:37:55,145 --> 00:37:58,182
I can get you things,
like a cheeseburger.

437
00:37:58,399 --> 00:38:01,519
I don't want you
to get me no cheeseburger.

438
00:38:02,027 --> 00:38:05,147
- I'll wash your socks.
- Don't wash my socks.

439
00:38:05,364 --> 00:38:09,196
You leave my socks alone, man.
Stay out of my face.

440
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:17,410
These are delicious.

441
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:22,621
Aren't you amazed at the quality
of these vegetables? In a prison?

442
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,841
I'm amazed at what's
crawling in our soup.

443
00:38:26,051 --> 00:38:29,337
- What are you talking about?
- Little creatures.

444
00:38:29,555 --> 00:38:31,512
- Where?
- There.

445
00:39:03,964 --> 00:39:07,629
What's his story?
Why does he get a separate table?

446
00:39:07,843 --> 00:39:13,264
That's Grossberger. The biggest killer
in the history of the Southwest.

447
00:39:13,474 --> 00:39:17,935
He killed his whole family and all
his relatives in one weekend.

448
00:39:18,145 --> 00:39:21,894
Then he killed some people
who reminded him of them.

449
00:39:22,107 --> 00:39:26,816
- He here for rehabilitation?
- He threw the chaplain through a wall...

450
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:31,074
...burned down the factory.
But he hasn't killed anyone here.

451
00:39:31,283 --> 00:39:35,826
I wouldn't sit with him,
and I killed my stepdaddy.

452
00:39:36,038 --> 00:39:42,076
I wonder what triggered all that
violence. He seems so gentle.

453
00:40:02,314 --> 00:40:04,022
I see what it is.

454
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:10,485
Nobody has ever just sat down
and honestly talked with that man.

455
00:40:13,909 --> 00:40:19,663
- Poor kid.
- The man's not ready for an interview.

456
00:40:36,098 --> 00:40:37,473
Hello.

457
00:40:41,645 --> 00:40:46,272
I'll wait till after
he's had a little nap.

458
00:40:46,483 --> 00:40:50,528
Do you mind? Why did you
kill your stepfather anyway?

459
00:40:50,738 --> 00:40:56,361
Criticizing my new fur jacket.
And slapping my hand.

460
00:41:31,737 --> 00:41:35,320
- What should we do with him, Jack?
- How late was he?

461
00:41:35,533 --> 00:41:37,027
A week.

462
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:43,327
You snort up all that nice blow
and then you forget about paying.

463
00:41:43,582 --> 00:41:46,619
Teach him to be punctual.

464
00:42:04,895 --> 00:42:08,015
- What was that all about?
- That's Jack Graham.

465
00:42:08,232 --> 00:42:10,271
You don't mess with him.

466
00:42:10,484 --> 00:42:15,230
- A guard can yank you out like that?
- He's an inmate like you and me.

467
00:42:15,447 --> 00:42:18,863
He runs the cellblock.
Dope, whiskey, a woman.

468
00:42:19,076 --> 00:42:23,655
He can get you anything you want.
And he can get you killed.

469
00:42:23,873 --> 00:42:27,953
Well, I don't want anything from him.

470
00:42:28,127 --> 00:42:33,880
That's Blade. He runs the Third World
side of cellblock two.

471
00:42:34,091 --> 00:42:39,298
Before Grossberger, he held the
axe-murder record in the Southwest.

472
00:42:39,513 --> 00:42:41,387
It's hard to be the best.

473
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,762
He's gonna give me the cheeseburger.
How do you like it?

474
00:42:45,978 --> 00:42:49,727
I don't want a cheeseburger.
I'm watching my weight.

475
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,933
- Don't worry.
- Getting fat.

476
00:42:52,151 --> 00:42:57,228
- I'll protect you. I make him uneasy.
- I wonder why.

477
00:42:58,449 --> 00:43:03,490
Hi. I'm going. Skip, my friend.
Excuse me, would you?

478
00:43:03,704 --> 00:43:06,076
- I'll come with you.
- Oh, shit.

479
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:13,128
I'm a little nervous.
Did you sleep any better last night?

480
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:17,206
A little between nightmares.
The walls close in on me.

481
00:43:17,426 --> 00:43:22,503
I know. I have it on the list. Roomier
cells, soap dish, toilet seats--

482
00:43:22,723 --> 00:43:24,965
What are you talking about?

483
00:43:28,729 --> 00:43:30,971
- That's ridiculous.
- Put that on your list.

484
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:35,270
- I will. Unnecessary violence.
- See what they did to him?

485
00:43:35,486 --> 00:43:37,146
Okay, you two, inside.

486
00:43:45,663 --> 00:43:54,417
- Inmates 65984 and 65985.
- The New Yorkers.

487
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:57,666
How do you do, sir?
Very nice to meet you.

488
00:43:57,883 --> 00:44:01,252
We'd like to touch--
I think I speak for Harry.

489
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,095
- Would like to--
- No.

490
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:09,394
Harry's a little nervous,
and I am a little bit too.

491
00:44:09,645 --> 00:44:12,562
This is a different
way of life for us.

492
00:44:12,815 --> 00:44:15,685
We'd like to discuss
with you some ideas...

493
00:44:15,943 --> 00:44:19,027
...we think would make
life easier for all.

494
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,820
- Oh, do we have to listen to this?
- Were you in the middle of something?

495
00:44:25,035 --> 00:44:31,405
No. Mr. Wilson just doesn't feel the
same need to be hospitable as I do.

496
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:33,624
Get on the bull!

497
00:44:33,878 --> 00:44:37,827
- Get on the ball?
- Get on the bull!

498
00:44:39,174 --> 00:44:45,213
Is that what that is? I didn't know.
Oh, is that a recreational activity?

499
00:44:45,431 --> 00:44:48,182
I was hoping for volleyball or tennis.

500
00:44:48,392 --> 00:44:52,604
We have an annual prison rodeo
we're awfully proud of.

501
00:44:52,813 --> 00:44:56,348
We like to run you new
fellas through a test...

502
00:44:56,609 --> 00:44:59,775
...to see if you have any
aptitude for it.

503
00:44:59,987 --> 00:45:01,695
Sure. Fine with me.

504
00:45:01,906 --> 00:45:06,484
- Be sure we don't miss some rodeo star.
- You don't need me, right?

505
00:45:06,702 --> 00:45:08,778
- You wanna shut up?
- Okay.

506
00:45:08,996 --> 00:45:13,207
- Okay, let her rip.
- You're on backwards.

507
00:45:16,295 --> 00:45:17,458
Okay.

508
00:45:20,925 --> 00:45:24,175
Over the rigging.

509
00:45:24,386 --> 00:45:26,924
I thought you meant the other way.

510
00:45:27,139 --> 00:45:31,007
I was looking for the
horns to come out. Okay.

511
00:45:31,227 --> 00:45:33,266
- You ready, Mr. Wilson?
- Ready.

512
00:45:33,521 --> 00:45:35,264
Proceed.

513
00:45:41,237 --> 00:45:45,448
Harry, you gotta try this.
It's fun.

514
00:45:45,658 --> 00:45:48,991
It's like the merry-go-round
at Coney Island.

515
00:45:49,203 --> 00:45:51,160
Try two level.

516
00:45:59,046 --> 00:46:03,091
Where's the part where I go,
"Hee-ya"?

517
00:46:03,342 --> 00:46:05,299
Go to three.

518
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:13,508
This is fun.

519
00:46:29,869 --> 00:46:31,908
Look, Ma. I'm dancing.

520
00:46:49,763 --> 00:46:51,839
Ride it, Skip!

521
00:47:03,819 --> 00:47:07,153
Ride that son of a bitch!

522
00:47:35,392 --> 00:47:36,768
All right.

523
00:47:44,777 --> 00:47:49,688
- Is it all right if I get off now?
- Yes. You can get off now.

524
00:47:52,493 --> 00:47:55,778
You two fellas can
go on back to your cells.

525
00:47:56,038 --> 00:47:57,366
Mr. Barstow!

526
00:47:57,581 --> 00:48:01,449
- We had a nice visit, didn't we?
- Yeah. Mr. Barstow!

527
00:48:01,669 --> 00:48:06,378
Here are the ideas I mentioned.
Why don't you chew on these?

528
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:09,260
When you're ready, we'll go over them.

529
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:13,175
- Get rid of them.
- Maybe we can meet for lunch.

530
00:48:14,431 --> 00:48:18,512
- I don't believe what I saw.
- The machine's malfunctioning!

531
00:48:18,727 --> 00:48:21,728
The machine's fine.
You want to try it?

532
00:48:21,939 --> 00:48:24,264
- It was luck.
- He's a born cowboy.

533
00:48:24,483 --> 00:48:27,769
- From New York?
- I don't care where he's from.

534
00:48:27,987 --> 00:48:30,904
No inmate ever took it to six level.

535
00:48:31,115 --> 00:48:37,070
Your big rodeo star, Graham,
never got it past a four.

536
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:41,541
- Graham's had injuries.
- I've had 10 years of humiliation!

537
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,668
I won't mention the money
trouble I'm in...

538
00:48:44,879 --> 00:48:49,375
...from losing to Warden Sampson
and his gorillas, because of him!

539
00:48:49,592 --> 00:48:54,337
If that kid's for real, he'll ride
for Glenboro in the next rodeo...

540
00:48:54,555 --> 00:48:59,098
...and we're gonna whip Sampson's boys
and win that goddamn prize!

541
00:48:59,351 --> 00:49:05,805
Get that kid back here in an hour.
I wanna test him on Double Aught again.

542
00:49:06,025 --> 00:49:09,857
- Check it out.
- You check it out.

543
00:49:15,826 --> 00:49:20,287
My back hurts, fellas,
I'm gonna have to drop out.

544
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:24,290
Okay.

545
00:49:25,794 --> 00:49:30,503
My back still hurts from yesterday.
Hurt it again.

546
00:49:30,716 --> 00:49:35,129
Harry, rub me a little bit,
right here, would you? That's it.

547
00:49:37,932 --> 00:49:42,261
That's better. Did you try that
thing in the warden's office?

548
00:49:42,478 --> 00:49:43,723
- It's fun.
- It is.

549
00:49:43,979 --> 00:49:47,929
Jesus was the champion
bull rider from his province.

550
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:53,061
You're kidding! That's wonderful.
Are you gonna ride in the rodeo?

551
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:57,527
- Jesus says the rodeo is bullshit.
- Why? How come?

552
00:49:57,743 --> 00:50:02,452
Do you know how much money
they make on it? $85,000 to $100,000.

553
00:50:02,665 --> 00:50:04,788
Hundred thousand dollars.

554
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,619
We're supposed to get the money.
We don't get shit.

555
00:50:08,837 --> 00:50:12,041
We get our ass kicked. They get rich.

556
00:50:12,258 --> 00:50:15,840
The prisoners don't get one
penny of that money?

557
00:50:16,053 --> 00:50:19,339
No, I'm exaggerating a little,
I guess.

558
00:50:19,557 --> 00:50:24,053
Two years ago we got new
Ping-Pong balls. Five boxes.

559
00:50:24,311 --> 00:50:28,938
I don't understand one thing.
Why do the guys go to the rodeo?

560
00:50:29,191 --> 00:50:33,568
They scare everybody by threatening
to deny their parole.

561
00:50:33,821 --> 00:50:37,404
- That's how they get the kiss-asses.
- Outrageous!

562
00:50:37,658 --> 00:50:44,159
In Texas, they run an honest rodeo.
The prisoners keep the prize money.

563
00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:49,373
Them wardens over there are pretty
decent. Not like these pricks.

564
00:50:49,587 --> 00:50:52,078
Isn't that fucking outrageous?

565
00:50:52,464 --> 00:50:56,925
Say, I hear you went to six
on Double Aught, hey?

566
00:50:57,178 --> 00:51:02,385
- He's my man.
- Did you tell him? It wasn't so tough.

567
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,051
Well, if you really did a six...

568
00:51:06,312 --> 00:51:11,104
...they're gonna want you to ride
in that Top Hand competition.

569
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:13,684
Don't worry. I'm no brown-noser.

570
00:51:13,903 --> 00:51:18,150
Everybody knows that.
Why don't you hear the man out?

571
00:51:18,407 --> 00:51:24,659
If you ride in the Top Hand event,
there's a good chance we can bust out.

572
00:51:24,914 --> 00:51:27,487
You know what I mean?

573
00:51:39,094 --> 00:51:44,053
- Is he talking about a jailbreak--?
- You bet your ass.

574
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:50,724
- What about our appeal?
- Appeal? Rory, tell him about appeals.

575
00:51:50,981 --> 00:51:56,568
The day I met you and Sweetpants was
my fifth appeal hearing in six years.

576
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:58,231
Turned me down.

577
00:51:58,489 --> 00:52:02,700
Do you want to spend 30 years in here?
I couldn't take it.

578
00:52:02,952 --> 00:52:06,736
And I know you can't.
We gotta get out of here.

579
00:52:10,543 --> 00:52:17,210
Hello, operator, get me Warden Sampson
at Doerin Prison, please. Thank you.

580
00:52:17,591 --> 00:52:21,803
Hello, Wally.
How's your team look this year?

581
00:52:22,054 --> 00:52:25,719
Not too bad. We might
give you a race this year.

582
00:52:25,975 --> 00:52:28,548
Is that right?

583
00:52:28,769 --> 00:52:30,762
You got some new blood?

584
00:52:31,647 --> 00:52:33,474
Something like that.

585
00:52:33,732 --> 00:52:37,148
Seeing as how you're in
such good shape...

586
00:52:37,361 --> 00:52:40,196
...you want to put some real
money down?

587
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:44,324
Well, I realize that $50,000...

588
00:52:44,535 --> 00:52:50,158
...ain't much these days, but it might
stimulate a little interest.

589
00:52:52,918 --> 00:52:58,957
Henry, one way or another,
I'm gonna cover that bet.

590
00:52:59,717 --> 00:53:02,208
What do you want me to do?

591
00:53:17,943 --> 00:53:22,985
You've got to convince the warden
that you won't ride, no matter what.

592
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:28,738
He'll be so mad, he'll wet his pants,
because he makes this very big bet.

593
00:53:28,996 --> 00:53:34,156
But you gotta hold out, no matter
what they do. Don't give up.

594
00:53:34,376 --> 00:53:38,326
The longer you hold out,
the better chance for a bargain.

595
00:53:38,589 --> 00:53:39,752
What bargain?

596
00:53:39,965 --> 00:53:42,291
- You pick your crew.
- That's us.

597
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:47,468
- The county stadium is tough to crack.
- Even tougher than this joint.

598
00:53:47,681 --> 00:53:53,387
- It's supposed to be escape-proof.
- But there's a weakness.

599
00:53:55,898 --> 00:54:00,607
This is fantastic.
Harry, there's a great novel in this.

600
00:54:00,819 --> 00:54:05,232
Which you won't start writing
till we get out of here, right?

601
00:54:06,742 --> 00:54:09,198
I guess I can wait seven months.

602
00:54:09,453 --> 00:54:11,362
Donahue!

603
00:54:13,832 --> 00:54:18,827
- Hello, warden. Nice to see you again.
- I've got some good news for you.

604
00:54:19,046 --> 00:54:23,755
- My wine magazines came?
- No, it's better than that.

605
00:54:23,968 --> 00:54:29,342
You're gonna represent Glenboro Prison
in the annual Top Hand competition.

606
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:32,842
Congratulations.

607
00:54:33,102 --> 00:54:36,720
Oh, my God! Warden!

608
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:42,058
- I can't do that.
- What the hell are you talking about?

609
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:45,777
I should've told you.
My mom was a veterinarian.

610
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:49,608
I can't exploit animals,
she'd roll over in her grave.

611
00:54:49,827 --> 00:54:53,611
You didn't hear me.
This is very important to me.

612
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:59,413
Important to you? My mother
is watching over every step I make.

613
00:54:59,628 --> 00:55:04,337
Do you know my soul is on the line?
Please, let's drop-- What?

614
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:09,212
I said no. I told him no.

615
00:55:09,471 --> 00:55:14,430
Ma, are you crazy? I have witnesses.
We'll talk about it in my cell.

616
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:23,522
I have to go to the bathroom.
Would you excuse me, warden?

617
00:55:26,572 --> 00:55:30,107
That boy is very confused.
Straighten him out!

618
00:55:30,367 --> 00:55:34,697
Well, what about Jack Graham?
His knees have mended.

619
00:55:45,132 --> 00:55:46,757
Wake him up.

620
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:53,094
- All right. On your feet. Let's move!
- What happened?

621
00:55:53,307 --> 00:55:57,803
Let's go, Mayor Koch.
And you too, Count Basie!

622
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,562
- What time is it?
- 4:30.

623
00:55:59,772 --> 00:56:00,851
Why so early?

624
00:56:01,065 --> 00:56:05,312
It's called paying your debt
to society. Now, let's move!

625
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:10,949
- Is breakfast ready?
- Somebody stole the toilet!

626
00:56:11,158 --> 00:56:13,696
Over here.

627
00:56:18,207 --> 00:56:21,540
You're peeing on me.

628
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:13,690
- Close 12.
- Close 12.

629
00:58:25,334 --> 00:58:31,337
Oh, shit! They're trying to kill me.
Please, God, please.

630
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:37,592
They're coming back.
They're coming back.

631
00:59:11,046 --> 00:59:12,754
Pillow.

632
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:17,502
I want my pillow.

633
00:59:32,276 --> 00:59:36,819
All right, you two. Up and at 'em!

634
00:59:50,711 --> 00:59:54,578
I can't feel nothing in my leg!

635
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,599
- Don't you see the white line?
- Yes.

636
01:00:03,807 --> 01:00:09,561
- You're not to be to the side of it.
- Sorry, mistake. Won't happen again.

637
01:00:09,813 --> 01:00:12,684
Too late for that.
Get him out of here.

638
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,056
Come on.

639
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:24,408
- Close 10!
- Close 10!

640
01:00:58,904 --> 01:01:05,025
Hey! My back!
My 11 -year-old back problem is gone.

641
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:11,538
I feel terrific. Thanks, cap. Wow!
What a lucky guy!

642
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:14,913
You son of a guns!

643
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:21,461
All right, get in there. I'll see you
in about five days, if you make it.

644
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:36,810
Donahue?

645
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:44,399
One more day, please.

646
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:50,322
Just one more day. I was beginning
to get into myself. Be a pal.

647
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:57,916
Harry, guess who's here?
How's my best--?

648
01:02:10,392 --> 01:02:14,722
Help me. Please help me!

649
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:21,517
I left my wallet in the solitary.
Could l? Oh, please.

650
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:29,741
Nighty-night, boys.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

651
01:02:43,884 --> 01:02:49,258
Grossberger.... Grossberger....

652
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:55,767
- Come here. I want to talk to you.
- I can't go to you. It's amazing.

653
01:02:56,021 --> 01:02:57,053
Excuse me.

654
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:02,611
- Don't touch him. Don't touch him.
- Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

655
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,896
Please don't touch him.

656
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:07,153
- See you later.
- Don't touch.

657
01:03:07,366 --> 01:03:08,777
I'll stand here.

658
01:03:09,034 --> 01:03:12,735
- Don't leave me, please.
- No. I'll just be over here.

659
01:03:21,672 --> 01:03:26,001
You think Grossberger ate them
up or did he leave some bones?

660
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:30,507
If he did, we're gonna ship them
back to Times Square.

661
01:03:38,772 --> 01:03:43,434
- Say what? No, this is a jack.
- I know this is illegal.

662
01:03:43,652 --> 01:03:48,777
- We tried charades. He doesn't get it.
- This is dead. You can't play it.

663
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:52,111
What is this? Look, what?
Cheating, look!

664
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,407
- Wait.
- What?

665
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:55,281
- Wait a second.
- What?

666
01:03:55,539 --> 01:03:59,584
- What? What do you call--?
- That's for this one.

667
01:04:02,671 --> 01:04:07,879
Well, how have you been getting along?

668
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:13,924
Excuse me. This is my cousin, Meredith.
She's been helping out on your case.

669
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:19,141
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

670
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:22,023
You too.

671
01:04:24,401 --> 01:04:28,980
It's amazing. There's hardly any
family resemblance. No offence.

672
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:37,447
We're just barely cousins. See,
my mother was a French cancan dancer.

673
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:43,546
And.... It's a long story.

674
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:47,170
Say, how've you been getting along?

675
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:53,798
Swell. Just swell.
A few ups and downs.

676
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:58,184
You know, people see movies
about prison life...

677
01:04:58,435 --> 01:05:01,520
...but until you've actually
spent time here...

678
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:07,111
...it's hard to get the real
flavour of what it's like.

679
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:11,573
More Americans should spend
time behind bars to understand.

680
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:14,320
More Americans probably will.

681
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:20,033
Now, we have made your preliminary
bid for retrial and....

682
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:23,997
Well, Meredith,
why don't you tell him?

683
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:28,458
Remember the little girl in the bank?
She's ready to swear...

684
01:05:28,674 --> 01:05:32,886
...you weren't in the woodpecker
suits during the robbery.

685
01:05:33,095 --> 01:05:37,971
She remembers that one
of the robbers had a tattoo.

686
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,721
- Do either of you have a tattoo?
- No.

687
01:05:40,936 --> 01:05:43,558
Good. I'll check the tattoo places.

688
01:05:43,772 --> 01:05:47,817
There's a raunchy strip joint
where tattooed guys hang out.

689
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:51,727
I'm gonna try for
a part-time job there.

690
01:05:51,947 --> 01:05:55,482
Now, because the little girl
is only 6...

691
01:05:55,701 --> 01:06:00,778
...the court said that her information
doesn't justify a new hearing.

692
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:03,038
We're trying to change that.

693
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,002
On the basis that
information was withheld.

694
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:09,296
All legal bullshit.
You were railroaded!

695
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:12,668
Another example
of a repressive system...

696
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,596
...coming down
on the bottom of society.

697
01:06:15,804 --> 01:06:21,143
I don't know about the bottom part,
but I agree with you on the rest.

698
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:27,556
You want to know something
that's always fascinated me...

699
01:06:27,775 --> 01:06:31,773
...are the prison romances
that sometimes spring up...

700
01:06:31,987 --> 01:06:38,654
...between inmates and girls from the
outside. Sometimes beautiful girls.

701
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:41,486
I mean, would you, for example...

702
01:06:41,705 --> 01:06:47,957
...could you actually become involved,
I mean romantically, with a prisoner?

703
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:53,171
Absolutely not.

704
01:06:57,263 --> 01:07:00,679
No, I didn't think so.

705
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:06,802
I was just curious.

706
01:07:07,022 --> 01:07:11,601
- How's he tougher than you thought?
- In a few days I'll break him.

707
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:16,730
We don't have a few days. Stock's
delivered. The contracts are out.

708
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:19,030
And Doerin is ahead of us.

709
01:07:19,243 --> 01:07:22,410
I thought the kid
would be a little softer.

710
01:07:22,621 --> 01:07:26,833
He's soft. You just don't know
where to kick him.

711
01:07:27,042 --> 01:07:31,621
What are you talking about, my
appendix? I know about appendix!

712
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:38,506
I had my appendix taken out already.
I had my appendix taken out. Help!

713
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:44,058
Sir, help me! Please! Help!

714
01:07:50,566 --> 01:07:54,480
- What you in for?
- There's gotta be some confusion.

715
01:07:54,695 --> 01:07:59,024
They say my appendix grew back,
but I had it removed years ago. You?

716
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:04,236
I came for a hernia operation. They
cut off one of my nuts by mistake.

717
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:06,531
Say what?

718
01:08:06,749 --> 01:08:08,741
They said I didn't need it.

719
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:14,879
Now I can't eat, I don't sleep, I got
no enthusiasm. I don't write my woman.

720
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:18,257
I'm getting out next year,
but I don't care.

721
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:20,426
You're sure taking it calm.

722
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:22,381
Nothing I can do now.

723
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:28,138
They got this Korean doctor just came
to this country. Don't get him.

724
01:08:28,354 --> 01:08:30,477
- Right.
- He did this to me.

725
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:35,310
Korean, right. Jesus Christ!
What's the matter with him?

726
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:41,613
Johnson's on a hunger strike. They're
force-feeding him to keep him alive.

727
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:45,402
Thank God.
There's some humanity in this place.

728
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:48,538
They're gonna electrocute
him next month.

729
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:51,703
Mr. Frazier? How do you go?

730
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:56,881
That's the cat that did me.

731
01:08:57,132 --> 01:08:59,458
Be sure you cover up them jewels!

732
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:12,601
- Hello, Donahue. What can I do for you?
- I'm ready to make a deal.

733
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:19,899
- Oh? What kind of deal?
- I want my own team.

734
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:25,071
And I want a bigger cell
with better ventilation.

735
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:30,867
- Has Grossberger been farting on you?
- Settle down, Wilson.

736
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:34,919
- I don't make deals, Donahue.
- I know.

737
01:09:35,170 --> 01:09:38,456
- But I think it might be arranged.
- Good.

738
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:43,674
I want to win that trophy. And I'm
counting on you to go balls-out.

739
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:48,342
I only have one speed: balls-out.

740
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:54,520
That's the spirit. You'll get
out of here a relatively young man.

741
01:09:54,773 --> 01:09:58,771
- I'm looking forward to that.
- I guess we have a deal.

742
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:00,564
I guess so.

743
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:04,772
Ride 'em, cowboy.

744
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,861
Okay.

745
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:18,670
- I want an inmate guard on them.
- Graham'll watch them.

746
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,039
Put Blade on Graham.

747
01:10:22,593 --> 01:10:24,087
Right.

748
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,979
Hey, sucker!

749
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:44,603
The shit's gonna start now.

750
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:49,826
Why are you joining the rodeo?
Sucking up to the warden?

751
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:54,746
He's not sucking up. We're having fun.
We showed aptitude for it.

752
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,035
Aptitude? You hear that?

753
01:10:57,253 --> 01:11:03,587
Lay off. The man's doing what he's got
to. They were gonna cut his nuts off.

754
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:07,549
- I don't want to discuss my nuts.
- Work your tail off...

755
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,044
Don't sweat it.

756
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:13,179
...then get replaced by an amateur
who knows nothing.

757
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:17,012
He may be going into the rodeo,
but he may not come out.

758
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:30,446
Oh, what a horse.
Jesus, what a beauty.

759
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:35,495
What a sweet, beautiful face he has.
Look, he's listening to us.

760
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:41,788
He's listening to every word we say,
I bet. Okay, sweetheart, here I come.

761
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:45,666
- Don't be misled. He's a chute fighter.
- Hello.

762
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:51,175
- He'll try to kill you in the chute.
- I don't think so. I'd love to try him.

763
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,299
Aren't you rushing a bit?

764
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:58,013
Did you see the look he gave?
He's a sweetheart, a pussycat.

765
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:03,141
- I've never ridden a real horse.
- Remember, no spurs in the belly.

766
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,400
- Not in the belly.
- Spurs high.

767
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:09,195
Okay. Well, this should be a snap.
Let her rip!

768
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:28,128
Skip! Skip! Are you all right?

769
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:36,512
I'm fine. I wanted to see
what it's like to get thrown.

770
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:40,262
Grossberger, I'm fine.
You can put me down now.

771
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:45,819
You get a little overprotective
sometimes. Okay, where's that sucker?

772
01:12:46,445 --> 01:12:50,063
Now, let me explain to you
about bulls, okay?

773
01:12:50,282 --> 01:12:56,949
A bull is the most evil, disgusting,
and crafty sucker in the world.

774
01:12:57,498 --> 01:13:03,951
He'll snot on you, fart on you, do
anything he can to mash out your brain.

775
01:13:04,171 --> 01:13:07,920
The worst kind of bull is the one
that won't do nothing.

776
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:10,541
Just stand there. Look at you.

777
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,759
That means he's studying you.

778
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,757
Learning your weak spots...

779
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:19,095
...and remembering them for
the time he prances on your head.

780
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:22,389
Blade, you got it wrong. I'm a clown.

781
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,806
I shoot firecrackers off...

782
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:27,735
...there's a little car
with midgets....

783
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:30,525
- That ain't no rodeo clown.
- I know--

784
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:34,695
A rodeo clown is the most
dangerous job in the world.

785
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:37,739
He's the one that
gets closest to the bull.

786
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:40,998
- He gets the best of the bull.
- I don't want--

787
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:44,537
- Hook to the left, hook to the side--
- Blade--

788
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:48,959
If the bull rider is in danger,
he's got to protect him.

789
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:52,632
Even if it means
getting his ribs pulled out!

790
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:55,341
- And being freight-trained.
- Freight-trained?

791
01:13:55,556 --> 01:14:01,262
Run over, just like a freight train.
Only with a bull, it's worse.

792
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:05,481
A freight train don't back up
and finish the job.

793
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:08,983
Later I'll show you how
to lie on a stretcher...

794
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:11,644
- ...when they come to pick you up.
- What?

795
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:17,492
Right. Now, let's practice trying
to sucker the bull out of the chute.

796
01:14:17,661 --> 01:14:21,659
The warden wants you in one
piece till after the rodeo.

797
01:14:21,832 --> 01:14:26,660
- Then your ass belongs to me, got that?
- What about balloons and stuff?

798
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:31,341
Every bull has a secret word
that makes him crazy.

799
01:14:31,508 --> 01:14:34,130
Sends him into his wildest ride.

800
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:37,090
Your job is to figure out that word.

801
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,972
Blade....

802
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:54,862
Bull.... Let me see....
Rumpelstiltskin?

803
01:14:57,660 --> 01:15:01,492
Uh.... Malt liquor.

804
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:03,788
Come on. Come on, bull.

805
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:10,541
Bull? Come on.

806
01:15:11,382 --> 01:15:13,374
Come on.

807
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:23,635
Hey. Hey, sexy.

808
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:25,887
Shit.

809
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,731
Oh, you motherfucker!

810
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:32,186
Congratulations! You found the word!

811
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:55,693
Over there.

812
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:10,076
Teresa....

813
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:38,444
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

814
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:42,195
A little groggy from looking
at records of tattoos.

815
01:17:42,366 --> 01:17:45,949
Who got which, when and where.
So far, nothing.

816
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:50,698
The court refuses to act
on the little girl's word.

817
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:52,743
Doesn't look too good, huh?

818
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:58,453
- Can you think of anything else?
- Some small piece of evidence...

819
01:17:58,716 --> 01:18:00,625
- ...anything.
- Anything.

820
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:05,262
This may sound silly, but have you seen
A Place in the Sun?

821
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:13,180
A Place in the Sun with
Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift?

822
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,265
Yeah.

823
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:17,066
That's my favourite.

824
01:18:18,235 --> 01:18:23,941
Your favourite? That's your--?
That's my favourite too!

825
01:18:30,039 --> 01:18:32,660
What does that tell us?

826
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:37,377
Maybe we're not such strangers
as circumstances would imply.

827
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:42,926
Maybe we're not.

828
01:18:43,761 --> 01:18:50,048
You know, I'm working on a new play,
and I just wondered...

829
01:18:50,226 --> 01:18:54,093
...would you like to come
to the opening night with me?

830
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,689
I'd love to.

831
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,808
You....

832
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:05,070
Maybe we ought to get you
out of here first, though.

833
01:19:05,241 --> 01:19:08,989
Okay. Shoot.

834
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:37,182
Supposed to be doing time.
It's a goddamned vacation for them.

835
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:40,685
How would you like an old-time
prison funeral?

836
01:21:40,855 --> 01:21:43,392
Could you go for that?

837
01:21:47,862 --> 01:21:54,860
Just relax. He's gonna draw Untamed
in the bronc event.

838
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:26,288
A hundred and twenty-five years
without a whiff of pussy.

839
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:32,545
- How'd that make you feel, Mason?
- Mean. Very, very mean.

840
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:43,926
Hello? Mr. Len Garber, please.

841
01:23:44,103 --> 01:23:47,554
Did he leave word
where he could be reached?

842
01:23:47,731 --> 01:23:50,816
Okay. Thank you.

843
01:23:58,409 --> 01:24:03,616
Operator? Please get me the sheriff's
office. This is an emergency.

844
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,960
I've been looking for you.

845
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:19,212
- Where've you been?
- Look at this.

846
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:24,346
It's so simple it is absurd.
It should be laughed out of court.

847
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:26,427
We'll talk about that later.

848
01:24:26,645 --> 01:24:29,730
- They're gonna kill your clients.
- They're innocent!

849
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:32,935
That's not the point.
I'll explain it later.

850
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,191
We have to get to the rodeo.

851
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:37,604
It's across town.
We'll never make it.

852
01:24:37,781 --> 01:24:40,782
We have to try.
Will you shut up and hurry?

853
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:44,534
I almost blew it.
How can I call myself a lawyer?

854
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:06,307
That's it for the preliminaries.

855
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,680
Get ready for the event
that you all came to see.

856
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:14,647
It's our featured event,
the Top Hand competition.

857
01:25:18,155 --> 01:25:22,200
- How's your secret weapon, Wally?
- Fit as a fiddle, Henry.

858
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:25,737
- It's a nice day for it, ain't it?
- Sure is.

859
01:25:26,413 --> 01:25:32,368
- Come on down, got your Coke here....
- Peanuts, popcorn....

860
01:26:59,882 --> 01:27:03,832
Now remember, spur him high
on the shoulders, okay?

861
01:27:04,011 --> 01:27:05,802
Try to keep a good rhythm.

862
01:27:05,971 --> 01:27:09,803
It's time for the wild and woolly
Top Hand competition.

863
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:14,269
Leading off for Glenboro Prison
is New Yorker Skip Donahue...

864
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:19,557
...doing time for making a withdrawal
without having an account.

865
01:27:19,735 --> 01:27:24,730
He told the judge he was just trying
to help New York by using our money.

866
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:29,118
- I hope I can remember everything.
- Good luck.

867
01:27:29,662 --> 01:27:32,995
Thanks. That's very kind of you.

868
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:59,306
That's our boy, baby!
That's our boy there!

869
01:28:05,531 --> 01:28:11,154
What do you say about that, folks?
He's got some cowboy in him, huh?

870
01:28:11,328 --> 01:28:14,614
He sure does. You old sly bones.

871
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:17,993
- Where'd you get him?
- We'll see.

872
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:24,210
Next up, five-time winner and current
champion, Caesar Geronimo.

873
01:28:24,383 --> 01:28:28,048
Got caught selling
some white powder at the border.

874
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,506
And by white powder,
I don't mean talcum powder.

875
01:28:31,682 --> 01:28:37,222
His horse is so tough it's already
put 11 cowboys in the hospital.

876
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:40,848
And that's just by breaking wind
on them.

877
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:23,770
All right! That cowboy must have
some real strong glue in the saddle.

878
01:29:35,371 --> 01:29:39,451
Ladies and gentlemen,
that man of mischief from Oklahoma...

879
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:45,123
...last year's runner-up is getting set
in chute number five, Ringo Stapelton.

880
01:29:45,339 --> 01:29:49,835
He's doing 99 years for kidnapping
a trainload of college girls...

881
01:29:50,052 --> 01:29:53,801
...on their way to a singing
contest in Las Vegas.

882
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:07,268
Oh, Ringo's in trouble already. He's
down, and the bull's on top of him!

883
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:19,612
Next is Bucky Stillwater...

884
01:30:19,832 --> 01:30:26,084
...found guilty of misplacing
$4 million worth of insurance money.

885
01:30:26,297 --> 01:30:28,669
The money was never recovered...

886
01:30:28,883 --> 01:30:32,963
...which is why Bucky has more friends
among the inmates...

887
01:30:33,179 --> 01:30:36,429
...than any other prisoner
in the whole system.

888
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:41,386
Whatever Bucky wants, old Bucky gets.
Except for parole, that is....

889
01:30:50,988 --> 01:30:56,777
Don't be too surprised if Bucky's out
in time to enjoy that loot...

890
01:30:56,994 --> 01:31:00,197
...before old age catches up
with him.

891
01:32:04,019 --> 01:32:09,180
Third up, out of chute number four,
is the Glenboro Prison entry.

892
01:32:09,358 --> 01:32:14,234
It's that city slicker again, who's
giving the champ a run for his money.

893
01:32:14,405 --> 01:32:17,489
Can he keep it up?
We're gonna all find out...

894
01:32:17,658 --> 01:32:21,952
...whether it's luck or if he's
really got some redneck in him.

895
01:32:22,121 --> 01:32:26,071
Up on Flapjack, here's Skip Donahue.

896
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:29,120
Okay. A little tighter, Jesus.

897
01:32:29,336 --> 01:32:31,044
- How's that?
- That's it.

898
01:32:34,633 --> 01:32:36,293
Watch his head.

899
01:32:39,972 --> 01:32:43,590
- Ready?
- Okay, let's go.

900
01:32:45,853 --> 01:32:48,142
Open the gate!

901
01:32:48,439 --> 01:32:51,724
Seem to have ourselves
a problem down here.

902
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:55,691
He'll be killed in there!

903
01:32:58,073 --> 01:33:01,324
Some son of a bitch
put a lock on the gate!

904
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:24,231
That New Yorker is full of surprises.

905
01:34:24,451 --> 01:34:28,117
Now here's last year's champ,
Caesar Geronimo...

906
01:34:28,289 --> 01:34:32,666
...riding a bull that nobody
can ride for more than 3 seconds.

907
01:34:32,877 --> 01:34:35,581
A bull by the name of Tornado.

908
01:35:15,836 --> 01:35:18,837
Now you know why he's
our defending champ.

909
01:35:19,048 --> 01:35:24,208
Well, folks, take a breather while
the judges tally up the scores.

910
01:35:24,428 --> 01:35:26,255
We'll pause for the cause...

911
01:35:26,472 --> 01:35:30,683
...and I'll be back in just a bit
to announce the winner.

912
01:35:40,194 --> 01:35:43,563
Hold on, folks, we got
ourselves the first...

913
01:35:43,781 --> 01:35:46,901
...push in the history of the prison
rodeo.

914
01:35:47,076 --> 01:35:51,453
There ain't gonna be any push.
I was ready for this.

915
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:06,135
Ladies and gentlemen,
hold on to your hats.

916
01:36:06,303 --> 01:36:11,974
As a tiebreaker, both wardens
have okayed the Hard Money event...

917
01:36:12,142 --> 01:36:16,010
...the single most dangerous
event in all of rodeo competition.

918
01:36:16,188 --> 01:36:18,810
All you have to do to win this event...

919
01:36:18,983 --> 01:36:24,225
...is snatch a little sack of money
between the horns of a bull.

920
01:36:24,405 --> 01:36:30,906
As soon as our two boys get ready,
we'll start our final competition.

921
01:36:47,469 --> 01:36:51,384
Are you ready for the main event?

922
01:36:52,016 --> 01:36:56,345
Well, listen to this. Warden Beatty
has just informed me...

923
01:36:56,520 --> 01:37:01,016
...that he and Warden Sampson
have so much faith in their boys...

924
01:37:01,233 --> 01:37:04,934
...that instead of splitting the purse
as usual...

925
01:37:05,154 --> 01:37:07,989
...it'll be a winner-take-all event.

926
01:37:08,199 --> 01:37:12,196
I'm saying that $50, 000 in bills
is gonna be tied...

927
01:37:12,369 --> 01:37:16,414
...between the horns of one of the
meanest bulls around.

928
01:37:16,624 --> 01:37:20,408
And whichever inmate grabs the money
is the winner.

929
01:37:20,586 --> 01:37:22,958
And here they are,
ladies and gentlemen.

930
01:37:23,130 --> 01:37:25,668
I get nervous sometimes before
these things.

931
01:37:25,841 --> 01:37:31,511
- Word is that your warden's a nice guy.
- He's a prick.

932
01:37:31,680 --> 01:37:38,264
A prick? Boy, did I hear that wrong.
Well, is it true you're an ass-kisser?

933
01:37:38,437 --> 01:37:43,348
- You're gonna get a punch in the mouth.
- I'm just telling you what I heard.

934
01:37:43,526 --> 01:37:45,186
I'm an ass-kisser too.

935
01:37:45,361 --> 01:37:49,939
We're both dumb if no one's gonna
get this money except two pricks.

936
01:37:50,115 --> 01:37:52,191
Stands to reason, doesn't it?

937
01:38:23,774 --> 01:38:27,523
I'll distract the bull,
you grab the money. Okay?

938
01:38:27,695 --> 01:38:30,102
What difference
does it make who wins?

939
01:38:30,281 --> 01:38:32,985
Why don't we give the cash
to the prisoners?

940
01:38:33,158 --> 01:38:39,778
I'll tell you what. You do whatever you
think is best, okay? Get ready.

941
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:06,883
The winner, and champion for the
sixth time in a row, Caesar Geronimo.

942
01:41:07,146 --> 01:41:09,933
Goddamn!

943
01:41:45,976 --> 01:41:49,844
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle!
That boy's lost his mind.

944
01:41:50,022 --> 01:41:54,649
Holy cow, there's gonna
be hell to pay for that.

945
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:07,369
Now to wrap up our day, here's
the greased-pig sacking contest.

946
01:44:15,918 --> 01:44:17,163
- Holy shit!
- What?

947
01:44:22,049 --> 01:44:25,085
What the hell is going--?
Are you okay?

948
01:44:25,511 --> 01:44:27,005
They're in the camper!

949
01:44:30,975 --> 01:44:34,759
Look, I'm sorry, but we're
in a real hurry, okay?

950
01:44:34,979 --> 01:44:36,936
What is going on?

951
01:45:02,798 --> 01:45:05,633
I'm sorry.
Harry Monroe, Skip Donahue...

952
01:45:05,801 --> 01:45:08,209
...Rory Schultebrand.

953
01:45:08,387 --> 01:45:13,096
- My wife, Teresa, and my brother, Ramon.
- Hello.

954
01:45:13,267 --> 01:45:16,470
- Hey, guys. That is yours.
- Where you guys going?

955
01:45:16,645 --> 01:45:19,101
Veracruz. We got some family there.

956
01:45:19,273 --> 01:45:23,816
- Hey, Rory going with you?
- Try to be brave, Sweetpants.

957
01:45:23,986 --> 01:45:27,735
- Oh, man! Take care.
- Be a good girl, now.

958
01:45:27,907 --> 01:45:32,284
Ramon! A su casa, honey.
It's me and you!

959
01:45:39,084 --> 01:45:42,038
He kissed me. Damn!

960
01:45:52,765 --> 01:45:54,556
Let's go.

961
01:46:02,191 --> 01:46:05,108
We got to get the hell out of here!

962
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:24,245
Wait a minute.

963
01:46:29,218 --> 01:46:31,257
- How'd you get out?
- We busted out.

964
01:46:31,428 --> 01:46:33,670
- But you're free!
- You're damn right!

965
01:46:33,848 --> 01:46:38,842
- No, they caught the other two guys.
- Thanks to Meredith.

966
01:46:39,019 --> 01:46:40,430
Oh!

967
01:46:42,523 --> 01:46:47,766
You mean, we're really free?
We're free!

968
01:46:53,534 --> 01:46:57,033
- You're a hell of a lawyer.
- Thanks. Thanks very much.

969
01:46:57,204 --> 01:47:00,573
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

970
01:47:04,920 --> 01:47:08,336
- Thanks for everything.
- It's okay.

971
01:47:14,263 --> 01:47:16,220
Thank you.

972
01:47:16,390 --> 01:47:18,098
It's okay.

973
01:47:28,736 --> 01:47:33,978
Come on. Let's get out of this state
before somebody changes their mind.

974
01:47:47,129 --> 01:47:50,913
- Aren't you forgetting something?
- What?

975
01:47:51,175 --> 01:47:54,129
What about my opening night?

976
01:47:54,303 --> 01:47:56,854
Am I still invited?

977
01:47:57,723 --> 01:48:01,550
Holy mackerel! How many times
