1
00:03:46,723 --> 00:03:50,576
D'you know
we've made love 113 times?

2
00:03:51,663 --> 00:03:54,751
I figured it out
on my Bowmar calculator.

3
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:58,316
To know someone that well
is a wonderful thing.

4
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,621
<i>- Two lumps?
- No. One.</i>

5
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,162
<i>So I don't know everything about you.</i>

6
00:04:02,162 --> 00:04:04,067
<i>I don't know who
your favorite movie stars are.</i>

7
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:06,708
<i>And I can't remember
the name of your favorite perfume.</i>

8
00:04:06,795 --> 00:04:09,057
<i>I've racked my brain
and I can't remember.</i>

9
00:04:09,187 --> 00:04:11,841
That's funny. It's "My Sin".

10
00:04:13,493 --> 00:04:17,798
<i>But I do know, in the last 24 years, that
I have never been out of love with you.</i>

11
00:04:25,537 --> 00:04:27,755
- Well, did we like it?
- I loved it.

12
00:04:27,886 --> 00:04:31,017
- Bev Walsh was wonderful.
- I liked them all.

13
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:35,539
It was funny. Well, it was a comedy,
wasn't it? Essentially?

14
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:39,104
Let's face it, Clyde Banner's getting fat.

15
00:04:39,234 --> 00:04:43,062
- He should never turn profile.
- Most of us shouldn't.

16
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:47,541
What was it you were thinking about?

17
00:04:48,775 --> 00:04:50,862
When?

18
00:05:41,678 --> 00:05:43,766
Yeah.

19
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:48,202
- You OK?
- Yeah. How was the show?

20
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:51,810
- Trouble sleeping?
- No.

21
00:05:51,942 --> 00:05:54,072
You're sure?

22
00:05:54,202 --> 00:05:56,289
- Burning the midnight oil?
- Yeah.

23
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,463
OK.

24
00:06:00,246 --> 00:06:03,768
- Thought about calling that doctor?
- No.

25
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:06,942
The month's up. I think
we should stick to the plan.

26
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:09,552
The plan was if I needed to call him.

27
00:06:09,682 --> 00:06:13,163
Yeah, OK.
Don't worry about it.

28
00:06:13,293 --> 00:06:16,745
Get some sleep. I'm workin' on
those Michigan State tickets.

29
00:06:16,832 --> 00:06:18,919
OK.

30
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,341
<i>Did you call the Warrens?</i>

31
00:06:55,472 --> 00:06:58,166
<i>They said they'll come
some evening soon.</i>

32
00:06:58,297 --> 00:07:01,255
<i>Everybody I grew up with
is in the paper these days.</i>

33
00:07:01,385 --> 00:07:05,820
"Joey Georgella. New football coach
for Trinity."

34
00:07:05,907 --> 00:07:08,559
<i>Did you check with Jane
for the Michigan State tickets?</i>

35
00:07:08,689 --> 00:07:12,779
Yes. She'll talk to John.
Where's Conrad? This'll get cold.

36
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,910
Con! Will you drop those suits
at the cleaners?

37
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,953
- They won't be back by Saturday.
- That's OK. Connie!

38
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:28,084
- Conrad!
- I'll be right there.

39
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:43,799
- Here he is.
- Morning.

40
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:46,016
Good morning.

41
00:07:49,087 --> 00:07:51,393
- Did you sleep?
- Yeah.

42
00:07:52,435 --> 00:07:54,479
Hungry?

43
00:07:55,306 --> 00:07:56,610
Hungry

44
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,350
- It's french toast. It's your favorite.
- Yeah.

45
00:08:02,394 --> 00:08:04,523
I'm not really hungry.

46
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:07,220
Breakfast, pal, remember?
Main meal, energy.

47
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,917
- If you're not hungry...
- Wait, Beth.

48
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:12,917
Heil eat it. It's french toast.

49
00:08:13,048 --> 00:08:15,830
There's fresh fruit
when you get home from school.

50
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:18,831
- What are you doing?
- You can't save french toast.

51
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:23,005
I've gotta run. Will you call
Mr. Hermann about the shutters?

52
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:27,310
- I can't get anywhere with that man.
- You have to charm Mr. Hermann.

53
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:29,701
Did you charm him?

54
00:08:34,051 --> 00:08:38,181
You have to eat, Con. We just want you
to keep on getting stronger.

55
00:08:38,746 --> 00:08:40,833
Dad, I'm not hungry.

56
00:08:40,964 --> 00:08:43,051
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

57
00:08:48,226 --> 00:08:51,966
- I gotta go. Lazenby's picking me up.
- Is he? Great.

58
00:08:53,227 --> 00:08:55,837
Why is it great?

59
00:08:55,923 --> 00:09:00,140
Well, I don't see the old gang
much any more. I kinda miss them.

60
00:09:01,227 --> 00:09:04,490
Why not bring them around?
Phil, Don and Dick Van Buren.

61
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,184
- We'll play touch football.
- See you later.

62
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:26,927
Con!

63
00:09:54,408 --> 00:09:56,931
Come on, Jarrett. We're late. Let's go.

64
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,714
Jarrett, come on!

65
00:10:05,714 --> 00:10:08,671
We're late cos little Dickie's mom
had to pack his lunch.

66
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:10,977
You were late
when you got to my house.

67
00:10:11,107 --> 00:10:14,020
I been up all night studying
for this poli-sci exam.

68
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,717
That guy wants a goddamn
personal analysis of it all.

69
00:10:17,848 --> 00:10:21,500
- How do you make sense of that crap?
- You read the crap.

70
00:10:21,631 --> 00:10:24,066
When's the last time
you read somethin'?

71
00:10:24,196 --> 00:10:26,413
We swim every day.
When are we meant to study?

72
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:30,154
- I swim and I study.
- Get a sense of reality, Lazenby.

73
00:10:30,284 --> 00:10:31,892
- What are you reading?
- Hardy.

74
00:10:32,023 --> 00:10:36,893
- You guys tried meditation?
- It's just like thinking. I don't do it often.

75
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:40,241
Is that junior English?
You got all junior classes this year?

76
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:42,458
They didn't pass you on anything?

77
00:10:43,372 --> 00:10:47,111
Stillman, they don't pass you
on breathing if you don't take the final.

78
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:50,199
Hey, get something on that radio.
I gotta study.

79
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,548
Get something lighter for your head.

80
00:10:52,678 --> 00:10:57,070
I hope it's a long train - I gotta get this
stuff down. I'm gonna flunk this test.

81
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,638
- My hair looks like shit, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

82
00:11:19,768 --> 00:11:21,639
Hey, there's Pratt.

83
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:24,335
- Look at that ass.
- Let me out. I need a jump.

84
00:11:24,465 --> 00:11:26,944
- No dirty stuff out of the window.
- No dirty stuff?

85
00:11:27,074 --> 00:11:31,596
Pratt, you have nice knees!
Interested in something, Jarrett?

86
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,858
Hey, Clary!

87
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:49,991
<i>How about we discuss some theory?</i>

88
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:52,858
Conrad, what's your theory
on Jude fawley?

89
00:11:53,772 --> 00:11:57,164
Conrad? What's your theory
on Jude fawley?

90
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:04,122
Was he powerless
in the grip of circumstances,

91
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:07,165
- or could he have helped himself?
- I don't...

92
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:11,514
Powerless?
I guess he thought he was, yeah.

93
00:12:11,645 --> 00:12:15,776
The guy was a jerk. He was hung up
on what was the moral thing to do.

94
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:19,603
- It made no sense.
- I think that's a little too easy, Joel.

95
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:21,386
Paul, what do you think?

96
00:12:21,472 --> 00:12:24,907
I found the book hard to follow.
I couldn't figure it out.

97
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:37,039
- Hello?
- Hello.

98
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:39,518
<i>- Hello?
- Dr. Berger?</i>

99
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:41,128
<i>Yes.</i>

100
00:12:41,258 --> 00:12:44,389
<i>- Hi, this is Conrad Jarrett calling.
- Who?</i>

101
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,084
Conrad Jarrett.

102
00:12:46,215 --> 00:12:51,737
Dr. Crawford at Hillsboro Hospital
gave me your number.

103
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:55,999
<i>Oh, yes. I'm with a patient now.
Can you call back at 2.15?</i>

104
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,781
I don't think I'll be free.

105
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:02,261
<i>Then give me your number.
I'll call you tonight.</i>

106
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:05,131
<i>Hello.</i>

107
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,565
<i>- Hello?
- That's OK. I'll try to call you back.</i>

108
00:13:08,696 --> 00:13:10,958
Thanks.

109
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,090
Go!

110
00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:18,350
OK, move it, you guys. Keep it goin'.

111
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:21,350
Keep pluggin'. Use those legs.

112
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:24,742
Lazenby, get with it.
Jarrett, keep your head down.

113
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,090
Work it out there. Come on.

114
00:13:27,222 --> 00:13:30,917
Come on. Push off.
Get your head down, Jarrett!

115
00:13:31,047 --> 00:13:35,831
Come on. Keep it goin'.
Dig in there. Get with it.

116
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:38,223
Push off, Jarrett!

117
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,398
Was he actually a client of yours?

118
00:13:54,355 --> 00:13:56,877
Well, Ray knew him more than me.

119
00:13:57,007 --> 00:14:02,269
It's too bad. Tragic really.
When you look at him now...

120
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:07,791
- fish too dry?
- No, not too dry.

121
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:15,619
- They have a new mechanic at CNS.
- What happened to little Harry?

122
00:14:15,706 --> 00:14:18,490
I don't know. I think
he took a job in Skokie.

123
00:14:19,184 --> 00:14:22,446
Anyway, this new mechanic
is just so awkward.

124
00:14:22,577 --> 00:14:25,924
Is that shirt ripped?
Leave it on the hall table.

125
00:14:26,055 --> 00:14:29,664
That girl from the hospital that you
painted with, wasn't she from Skokie?

126
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:31,273
- What was her name?
- Karen.

127
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,709
- Sharon?
- Karen.

128
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,404
Conrad, shall I sign you up
for a round robin at the club?

129
00:14:37,535 --> 00:14:42,144
- I haven't played in a year.
- Don't you think it's time to start?

130
00:14:48,492 --> 00:14:51,623
Also, Calvin, we have to go
to the Murrays' on Saturday.

131
00:14:51,754 --> 00:14:55,016
It's Clark's birthday.
I bought him that book on wine.

132
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:57,537
Dear God, not the Murrays.

133
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:02,451
Lift the rope off, Bucky.

134
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,147
We're goin' in.

135
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,147
Give me your hand.

136
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:10,712
Bucky!

137
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:11,930
fuck... fuck...

138
00:15:51,022 --> 00:15:53,240
Oh, hi. How are you?

139
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:56,633
I'm fine. Couldn't be better.
Really. Oh, terrific.

140
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,504
Hi. Come in.
It's OK. They all do that.

141
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:21,376
Jarrett?

142
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:24,593
Come in. Sit down.

143
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:33,638
Just have to... Wires... Volume.

144
00:16:42,204 --> 00:16:44,508
Sorry. Sit down.

145
00:16:46,987 --> 00:16:49,770
- Have trouble finding the place?
- Not yet.

146
00:16:54,162 --> 00:16:55,901
Jarrett.

147
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:59,032
How long have you been
out of the hospital?

148
00:16:59,163 --> 00:17:01,206
A month and a half.

149
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:04,598
- feeling depressed?
- No.

150
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:07,772
- On stage?
- Pardon me?

151
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:12,208
People nervous, treating you
like you're a dangerous character?

152
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,861
Yeah, I guess a little.

153
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:19,165
- Are you?
- I don't know.

154
00:17:24,514 --> 00:17:27,864
- How long were you in the hospital?
- four months.

155
00:17:29,384 --> 00:17:33,255
- What did you do?
- I tried to off myself. Isn't it there?

156
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,474
- It doesn't say what your method was.
- Double-edge Super Blue.

157
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:48,605
So how is it being home?
Everybody glad to see you?

158
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,170
Yeah.

159
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:53,126
- friends? OK?
- Yeah.

160
00:17:53,257 --> 00:17:56,736
You're back in school?
Everything OK at school?

161
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:59,302
- Teachers?
- Yeah.

162
00:17:59,432 --> 00:18:01,475
No problems?

163
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:05,214
So why are you here?

164
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:14,826
I'd like to be more in control, I guess.

165
00:18:15,912 --> 00:18:18,000
Why?

166
00:18:18,088 --> 00:18:20,696
So people can quit worrying about me.

167
00:18:21,739 --> 00:18:26,088
- Who's worried about you?
- My father, mostly. This is his idea.

168
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:29,611
What about your mother?
Isn't she worried about you too?

169
00:18:29,741 --> 00:18:30,819
I don't know, listen...

170
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:33,263
If you're a friend of Dr. Crawford
you're probably all right

171
00:18:33,394 --> 00:18:37,221
but I'll be straight with you,
I don't like this already.

172
00:18:37,307 --> 00:18:39,611
As long as you're straight.

173
00:18:39,742 --> 00:18:42,395
What do you know about me?
Have you talked to Crawford?

174
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,630
Yes, he called me on the phone.

175
00:18:43,637 --> 00:18:48,134
He told me your name and told me to look for you.

176
00:18:48,264 --> 00:18:53,745
He said you had a brother who died.
Boating accident, wasn't it?

177
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:58,265
Want to tell me about it?

178
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,224
I suppose you talked this over
with Crawford, right?

179
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:15,356
- Right.
- Good. How'd that go?

180
00:19:15,617 --> 00:19:17,705
It didn't change anything.

181
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:22,269
- What do you wanna change?
- I told you, I'd like to be more in control.

182
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:28,096
- Why?
- So people can quit worrying about me.

183
00:19:29,922 --> 00:19:32,401
Well, I'll tell you something.

184
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:34,619
I'll be straight with you, OK?

185
00:19:35,663 --> 00:19:37,968
I'm not big on control.

186
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:43,055
- But it's your money.
- Yeah, so to speak.

187
00:19:44,446 --> 00:19:46,535
So to speak.

188
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:49,578
OK...

189
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,535
How's Tuesdays and Fridays,
same time?

190
00:19:58,623 --> 00:20:02,840
- Twice a week?
- Well, control's a tough nut.

191
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:06,840
I got swim practice every night.

192
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:12,710
That's a problem.
How do we solve that?

193
00:20:14,015 --> 00:20:17,146
I guess I have to skip practice
mice a week and come here.

194
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:19,496
It's up to you.

195
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:23,104
I don't like being here.
I don't like it at all.

196
00:20:29,193 --> 00:20:33,063
I saw Mort Swain. His sister died.

197
00:20:33,584 --> 00:20:37,062
- The one from Idaho?
- The one with the restaurant.

198
00:20:38,454 --> 00:20:41,672
- Did she die in Idaho?
- I guess so.

199
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,020
Why?

200
00:20:44,194 --> 00:20:47,629
You said she was always traveling.
I wondered if she died in Idaho.

201
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:50,629
I don't know. Maybe she died in Idaho.

202
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,760
Maybe in Kansas City.

203
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:02,805
I went to see Dr. Berger.

204
00:21:02,892 --> 00:21:05,545
- Berger? Did you?
- Yeah.

205
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:08,022
- You didn't say anything. Good.
- I went.

206
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:09,501
- When?
- Today.

207
00:21:09,631 --> 00:21:11,980
I didn't know
you made an appointment.

208
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:17,200
- If it's too much money, it's not nec...
- Don't worry about the money. It's OK.

209
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:20,330
Well, it's $50 an hour, mice a week.

210
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,547
It's OK, and it is necessary.

211
00:21:23,677 --> 00:21:26,417
- What did you talk about?
- Not much.

212
00:21:26,548 --> 00:21:29,417
What about your schedule?
Will that be all right?

213
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:32,026
Well, it'll cut into swim practice.

214
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:35,896
- Where's his office?
- Highland Park.

215
00:21:40,419 --> 00:21:44,854
Keep that head straight, Genthe.
I don't wanna tell you again.

216
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:50,202
Now, this is what I see.

217
00:21:51,246 --> 00:21:54,464
I see you yawnin'. I see you come late.

218
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,900
I don't see you havin' any fun out there.

219
00:21:57,986 --> 00:22:00,509
- Are you gettin' enough sleep?
- Yeah.

220
00:22:02,378 --> 00:22:06,030
- Well, are you havin' fun out there?
- fun?

221
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,640
There's no point
if you're not havin' fun. Right?

222
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:12,162
- I guess so.
- You guess so?

223
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:19,512
Are you on medication, Jarrett?
Tranquillizers? Anything?

224
00:22:20,033 --> 00:22:21,990
No, sir.

225
00:22:22,121 --> 00:22:25,947
Did I ask you before
if they gave you shock out there?

226
00:22:26,077 --> 00:22:28,513
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what?

227
00:22:28,644 --> 00:22:31,123
Yeah, you asked me. Yeah, they did.

228
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:35,426
Don't look at us, Lazenby.

229
00:22:35,513 --> 00:22:39,123
Get your ass in the water!
Look at the bottom of the pool.

230
00:22:43,385 --> 00:22:45,688
You know, I'm no doctor, Jarrett.

231
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:50,211
I would never have let 'em
put electricity in my head.

232
00:22:51,646 --> 00:22:54,777
God, that Salan! He's such a picky
bastard. Drives me nuts.

233
00:22:54,864 --> 00:22:57,168
Everybody drives you nuts.

234
00:22:58,516 --> 00:23:01,908
- Danoff and Edge look good, Jarrett.
- They look very good.

235
00:23:01,996 --> 00:23:05,474
- Con, is he givin' you a hard time?
- He gives everybody a hard time.

236
00:23:05,605 --> 00:23:10,083
- You don't want a clarinet, do you?
- Van Buren wants a clarinet.

237
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:12,476
- Who's selling it?
- My brother.

238
00:23:12,606 --> 00:23:14,954
- I need new shoes.
- You need a new personality.

239
00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:19,128
- You stand behind me in the choir.
- I do? You do? Is that you?

240
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,607
- You have a lot of energy.
- I do?

241
00:23:21,737 --> 00:23:24,391
Yeah. I mean, that's good.

242
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:27,869
- My name's Jeannine Pratt.
- Nice. Hi.

243
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,129
- You're Conrad Jarrett, remember?
- Right.

244
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:35,000
- Bye
- Bye-bye

245
00:23:37,131 --> 00:23:39,436
You got a lot of energy.

246
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:43,914
Trick or treat!

247
00:23:44,044 --> 00:23:47,915
This is the scariest ghost I've ever
seen! And the tiger and the witch...

248
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:50,957
You all look just wonderful.
Take an apple.

249
00:23:51,089 --> 00:23:53,133
There you go. Be careful.

250
00:23:53,263 --> 00:23:55,741
Thank you, Mrs. Jarrett. Bye.

251
00:23:57,264 --> 00:24:01,351
The Cabbots. Little Julie's first time.
God, she's so cute.

252
00:24:06,874 --> 00:24:09,047
Know what I've been thinking?

253
00:24:09,135 --> 00:24:13,266
That Christmas in London would be
like something out of Dickens.

254
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:17,702
We've never done that before, right?
Christmas in London?

255
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:20,702
Maybe we shouldn't plan
to go away right now.

256
00:24:22,095 --> 00:24:25,267
We talked about that.
We decided on that.

257
00:24:26,138 --> 00:24:30,399
I know we did, but the more I talk
about it, the more the timing doesn't...

258
00:24:30,486 --> 00:24:34,138
Calvin, we've always
gone away at Christmas.

259
00:24:34,268 --> 00:24:39,574
I think it would be good for him too.
Isn't it time we got back to normal?

260
00:24:39,661 --> 00:24:42,618
He's just started with this doctor.

261
00:24:42,705 --> 00:24:45,183
- So he'll miss three weeks.
- Why interrupt it?

262
00:24:45,314 --> 00:24:48,140
Because I wanna get away.

263
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,706
I think we all should. It's important.

264
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:56,271
Look, if he doesn't
go through with this now,

265
00:24:56,402 --> 00:24:58,750
he might change his mind.

266
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:04,186
If he changes his mind,
maybe it wasn't right for him to do.

267
00:25:04,274 --> 00:25:08,881
- Does he want to go to London?
- I don't think he knows what he wants.

268
00:27:16,249 --> 00:27:17,466
I'm sorry.

269
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:20,075
- Don't do that!
- I'm sorry.

270
00:27:21,727 --> 00:27:25,293
- I didn't think you were here.
- I'm sorry. I just got in.

271
00:27:25,423 --> 00:27:28,641
- I didn't play golf. It's too cold.
- How was your golf game?

272
00:27:28,728 --> 00:27:31,902
- I didn't play.
- It did get colder today.

273
00:27:32,033 --> 00:27:34,599
No, I mean, for the year it's colder.

274
00:27:34,729 --> 00:27:36,338
Yeah.

275
00:27:37,295 --> 00:27:41,077
- Weren't you swimming today?
- Uh-huh. Sorry I scared you.

276
00:27:41,207 --> 00:27:43,903
- How'd it go?
- Good. I swam well today.

277
00:27:43,991 --> 00:27:46,209
Good.

278
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:49,210
- I could swim the 50 if my timing...
- Off.

279
00:27:49,643 --> 00:27:53,165
..if my timing got better.
I'm just a little off on my timing.

280
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:55,775
- Well, you have to work at that.
- Yeah.

281
00:27:57,471 --> 00:27:59,776
I got 74 on a trig quiz.

282
00:28:00,818 --> 00:28:04,471
74? Gee, I was awful at trig.

283
00:28:05,645 --> 00:28:07,559
You took trig?

284
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,776
Wait a minute...

285
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:16,865
Did I take trig?

286
00:28:21,083 --> 00:28:24,170
I bought you two shirts.
They're on your bed.

287
00:28:26,822 --> 00:28:29,780
- Who's gonna be there?
- The Murrays, of course,

288
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:33,041
and the Gunthers, the Kanes
and the good old us.

289
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,954
Why don't we just
go to the movies instead?

290
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:38,999
Don't be negative.

291
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:41,782
That's not negative.
That's unpredictable.

292
00:28:41,912 --> 00:28:44,912
- Come on. Let's really go to the movies.
- OK.

293
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:48,522
- Really?
- OK, yeah. Let's go.

294
00:28:49,913 --> 00:28:52,173
What's our excuse?

295
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,261
Beth wanted to go to the movies?

296
00:28:56,348 --> 00:28:58,869
Good. Very good.

297
00:29:04,915 --> 00:29:09,002
All right, now, smile.
And remember, not too many martinis.

298
00:29:14,524 --> 00:29:17,613
Hello, Gladyce. Will you put that
with the rest of them?

299
00:29:17,699 --> 00:29:21,917
- We're in time for the grand entrance.
- Look who's here!

300
00:29:22,483 --> 00:29:25,136
Three blocks away
and the last to arrive.

301
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:26,701
Come on in.

302
00:29:26,787 --> 00:29:31,092
Clark! Happy birthday.
You look wonderful for a 75-year-old.

303
00:29:37,703 --> 00:29:40,180
- Hey, partner. How are you?
- Hey, pal.

304
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:44,703
- Hi, Beth.
- And where were you at the lunch?

305
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:48,095
- Borrow the money.
- I was thinking of going public.

306
00:29:48,183 --> 00:29:51,833
I wouldn't do that now.
Cos the market's low.

307
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:56,226
Your hair looks wonderful.
It's shorter, isn't it? I like that.

308
00:29:56,313 --> 00:30:01,052
I said "Would you please put out
our cigar?" and he says "Huh?"

309
00:30:01,183 --> 00:30:05,010
I said "Will you put out your cigar?"
and he says "I don't have another one."

310
00:30:06,445 --> 00:30:08,489
Good to see you.

311
00:30:09,837 --> 00:30:12,401
It's a macho factor.
When these kids are at school,

312
00:30:12,532 --> 00:30:16,447
they just think they've got
to walk on the edge of danger.

313
00:30:16,577 --> 00:30:20,840
- What are these hushed tones about?
- He just told the funniest joke!

314
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,796
- I'm not talking to you.
- Why?

315
00:30:27,013 --> 00:30:30,579
Obviously, you know, I have
my fingers crossed on this merger.

316
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,927
- Let's get together for lunch.
- Great.

317
00:30:33,013 --> 00:30:36,406
Call me in the office.
I have no idea what my schedule is.

318
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:39,971
I ran into Billy White.
Bob McClean's leaving Coles & Johnson.

319
00:30:40,058 --> 00:30:43,103
- Where's he going?
- He doesn't know.

320
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:48,799
No, you didn't. You are so mean.
He's the meanest man you ever met.

321
00:30:49,712 --> 00:30:51,146
When a ball is in play,

322
00:30:51,234 --> 00:30:55,843
if a player, his partner, their equipment
or their caddies accidentally move it...

323
00:31:19,368 --> 00:31:20,847
Hi, Annie.

324
00:31:20,934 --> 00:31:24,891
- What's your boy up to these days?
- Who knows? They won't tell.

325
00:31:24,978 --> 00:31:28,500
- How's Conrad doing?
- He's great. Just great.

326
00:31:29,543 --> 00:31:32,544
I asked Donald and he says
they haven't talked much.

327
00:31:32,674 --> 00:31:35,719
I said "Maybe he's
a little self-conscious."

328
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:42,197
No, no.

329
00:31:43,328 --> 00:31:44,850
No, he's...

330
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,198
There's a doctor in Highland Park
that he sees mice a week.

331
00:31:48,285 --> 00:31:50,894
That kinda cuts into his social life.

332
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:56,417
- He's great, just great.
- Really? Is he still having problems?

333
00:31:56,504 --> 00:32:01,026
Oh, no. Nothing like that.
Just somebody to talk to, that's all.

334
00:32:01,156 --> 00:32:03,896
Polish off the rough edges, that's all.

335
00:32:04,027 --> 00:32:06,766
How you doing, darling?
Is he falling asleep yet?

336
00:32:06,853 --> 00:32:09,287
No. He's great.

337
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,417
Mr. Great, that's me.

338
00:32:19,247 --> 00:32:22,116
- You drink too much at parties.
- I'm not drunk.

339
00:32:22,247 --> 00:32:25,116
Why did you say
Conrad is seeing a psychiatrist?

340
00:32:25,247 --> 00:32:26,594
Why not?

341
00:32:26,726 --> 00:32:29,857
People don't hear
that kind of thing very easily.

342
00:32:29,988 --> 00:32:33,160
for most people it's a status symbol,
like going to Europe.

343
00:32:33,248 --> 00:32:36,291
Well, I thought blurting it out
was in very bad taste.

344
00:32:36,379 --> 00:32:38,510
Not to mention a violation of privacy.

345
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:41,684
- Whose privacy?
- Our privacy. The family's privacy.

346
00:32:41,814 --> 00:32:44,380
I think it is a very private matter.

347
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:55,468
So what do I do? Tell you my dreams?

348
00:32:55,554 --> 00:32:57,816
I don't hold much stock in dreams.

349
00:32:57,947 --> 00:33:00,598
All psychiatrists believe in dreams.

350
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,687
Really?

351
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:04,861
What's happening?

352
00:33:05,644 --> 00:33:08,165
What's going on?

353
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:10,774
I just feel so...

354
00:33:12,861 --> 00:33:15,428
- What?
- Jumpy. I don't know...

355
00:33:16,471 --> 00:33:18,994
Look, kiddo...

356
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,081
I lied. I do believe in dreams.

357
00:33:22,994 --> 00:33:25,909
But I wanna know what's happening
when you're awake.

358
00:33:25,995 --> 00:33:29,560
Something's making you nervous.
You're making me nervous.

359
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,778
Maybe I need a tranquillizer.

360
00:33:31,908 --> 00:33:35,082
- Tranquillizer.
- Yeah. What do you think?

361
00:33:35,692 --> 00:33:38,865
You came in looking like
something out of the Body Snatchers,

362
00:33:38,995 --> 00:33:42,474
It's not my impression
that you need a tranquillizer.

363
00:33:44,954 --> 00:33:47,258
- What is this?
- Clock.

364
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,389
So you get to tell the time, but I can't?

365
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:55,259
- So you know when the hour's up?
- Right.

366
00:33:55,389 --> 00:33:58,260
50 minutes, 55 minutes? What is it?

367
00:34:06,347 --> 00:34:09,218
Maybe I don't wanna swim any more.

368
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:11,695
I mean, my timing's for shit.

369
00:34:11,826 --> 00:34:15,652
Now he's got mo guys swimming
the 50 that are better than me.

370
00:34:15,783 --> 00:34:18,176
Jeez, they're a bunch
of boring-ass jocks.

371
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:21,959
And him, I can't stand him.
He's a tight-ass son of a bitch.

372
00:34:22,045 --> 00:34:23,394
Ever thought of quitting?

373
00:34:23,524 --> 00:34:26,046
- Are you telling me to?
- No.

374
00:34:26,742 --> 00:34:30,786
- It wouldn't look good.
- forget how it looks. How does it feel?

375
00:34:32,134 --> 00:34:34,264
How does it feel? How does it feel?

376
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:37,265
Yes. How does it feel?

377
00:34:39,222 --> 00:34:42,527
It's the same damn thing I did last year.

378
00:34:42,613 --> 00:34:45,265
- Are you the same person as last year?
- I don't know.

379
00:34:45,396 --> 00:34:47,136
- So you need a tranquillizer?
- You tell me.

380
00:34:47,266 --> 00:34:48,396
It's up to you.

381
00:34:48,484 --> 00:34:51,441
$50 an hour. Can't you decide
if I should have a pill or not?

382
00:34:51,528 --> 00:34:55,224
- I'm supposed to feel better, right?
- Not necessarily.

383
00:35:01,486 --> 00:35:04,399
How is it with your friends?
Getting any easier?

384
00:35:04,529 --> 00:35:06,572
No, it's still hard.

385
00:35:06,703 --> 00:35:08,747
Is anyplace easy?

386
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:15,618
- The hospital was.
- It was? Why?

387
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:21,010
Because nobody hid anything there.

388
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:23,967
Was there anyone there
you could talk to?

389
00:35:25,446 --> 00:35:27,793
I mean besides Dr. Crawford?

390
00:35:38,185 --> 00:35:39,229
Hi.

391
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,273
Hey, Karen.

392
00:35:41,405 --> 00:35:42,665
Hi.

393
00:35:42,796 --> 00:35:45,623
- How are you?
- Good. Real good.

394
00:35:45,709 --> 00:35:48,232
- Sit down, please.
- Thank you.

395
00:36:17,019 --> 00:36:20,019
- When did you get back?
- The end of August.

396
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:21,714
God...

397
00:36:21,845 --> 00:36:24,063
- It's great to see you.
- You too.

398
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,760
I can't stay a real long time.
I've got a meeting over at school.

399
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:33,802
Drama club meeting. We're doing
A thousand Crowns this year.

400
00:36:33,933 --> 00:36:38,543
We are going crazy trying to get it
together. I'm secretary this year too.

401
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,109
- Don't let me hang you up.
- You're not.

402
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,716
No, I really wanted to see you.

403
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:49,153
I didn't know quite what to expect.
You sounded sorta funny on the phone.

404
00:36:49,283 --> 00:36:53,675
No, I wasn't... It was a gray day,
that's all. Kind of...

405
00:36:53,763 --> 00:36:56,763
But everything's great.
I'm in school, on the swim team.

406
00:36:56,849 --> 00:37:01,285
You're swimming. Terrific, Conrad.
God, that's really wonderful.

407
00:37:01,415 --> 00:37:04,329
We haven't had any meets yet.
I could stay on the bench...

408
00:37:04,459 --> 00:37:06,762
Come on, you'll do great.

409
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:10,198
- I bet your folks are real proud of you.
- Yeah.

410
00:37:12,633 --> 00:37:15,416
- What can I get you guys?
- Are you hungry at all?

411
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:19,070
- I just want a Coke.
- Two Cokes, please.

412
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:23,984
- You think we offended him?
- Something I said?

413
00:37:25,507 --> 00:37:28,071
Definitely a low self-image day.

414
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,376
So.

415
00:37:31,463 --> 00:37:33,550
- Are you...
- What are...

416
00:37:36,029 --> 00:37:40,637
I can't believe how beautiful you look.
You really look beautiful.

417
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,421
So do you.

418
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:45,900
- Do you miss it?
- Miss what?

419
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,377
- The hospital.
- No.

420
00:37:49,856 --> 00:37:50,899
Thank you.

421
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:53,987
- You don't miss it? Nothing about it?
- No.

422
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:56,684
You don't miss Leo's corny jokes?

423
00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:05,467
- Are you seeing a doctor?
- Yeah, I'm seeing a doctor. Are you?

424
00:38:08,033 --> 00:38:11,599
Well, Dr. Crawford gave me a name,
and I went for a while, but...

425
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:16,991
It just didn't work for me, I guess.
He kept telling me what I already knew,

426
00:38:17,122 --> 00:38:21,339
and finally I decided the only one
who can help me is myself.

427
00:38:23,904 --> 00:38:26,557
At least, that's what my dad says.

428
00:38:27,644 --> 00:38:30,255
I don't mean it's not right
for you, Conrad.

429
00:38:30,385 --> 00:38:33,123
If it's what you wanna do,
that's what you should do.

430
00:38:33,253 --> 00:38:37,603
I don't know how long I'm gonna
keep it up. I sorta got shoved into it.

431
00:38:40,124 --> 00:38:42,211
Your hair grew in.

432
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,472
That was such a dumb thing to do.

433
00:38:47,343 --> 00:38:49,647
- I like it.
- You do?

434
00:38:53,604 --> 00:38:55,822
I don't know, I just...

435
00:38:55,909 --> 00:38:58,561
I miss it sometimes, the hospital.

436
00:38:59,431 --> 00:39:01,518
Really do.

437
00:39:03,084 --> 00:39:07,780
- Things have to change, you know.
- But that's where we had the laughs.

438
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:10,693
But that was a hospital.

439
00:39:10,823 --> 00:39:12,911
This is the real world.

440
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:15,173
Yeah. I guess you're right.

441
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:25,479
I really have to go.

442
00:39:25,566 --> 00:39:29,827
I'm sorry. I have a meeting
over at the school.

443
00:39:29,957 --> 00:39:32,305
Drama club meeting. We're doing
A thousand Crowns...

444
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:34,697
I know. You told me.

445
00:39:36,698 --> 00:39:39,088
- Did I?
- Yeah.

446
00:39:40,915 --> 00:39:43,828
I better hurry. Don't wanna be late.

447
00:39:47,482 --> 00:39:50,524
Thanks for seeing me.

448
00:39:51,177 --> 00:39:53,656
Conrad?

449
00:39:53,786 --> 00:39:56,265
Let's have a great Christmas.

450
00:39:59,004 --> 00:40:00,874
OK?

451
00:40:01,004 --> 00:40:04,005
Let's have a great year.

452
00:40:05,832 --> 00:40:09,398
Let's have the best year
of our whole lives, OK?

453
00:40:09,528 --> 00:40:12,788
We can, you know.
This could be the best year ever.

454
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,659
Yeah.

455
00:40:17,225 --> 00:40:19,269
Yeah.

456
00:40:21,747 --> 00:40:23,400
- Will you call me?
- Yeah.

457
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:25,574
- You mean it?
- Yep.

458
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:31,574
You... you look good, Conrad.

459
00:40:34,271 --> 00:40:36,358
Bye, Bye
- b Y e.

460
00:40:42,402 --> 00:40:44,488
Would you cheer up?

461
00:41:23,842 --> 00:41:26,278
It's cold out here.

462
00:41:27,756 --> 00:41:31,018
You should put that on,
or do you want a sweater?

463
00:41:31,713 --> 00:41:33,802
Do I need one?

464
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:41,758
- What are you doin'?
- Nothin'.

465
00:41:43,193 --> 00:41:45,149
Thinkin'.

466
00:41:46,411 --> 00:41:49,715
- About what?
- Not about anything.

467
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:56,238
Your hair is starting to grow out.

468
00:41:56,326 --> 00:41:58,760
It's looking better.

469
00:42:05,195 --> 00:42:07,239
I was thinking about the pigeon.

470
00:42:07,326 --> 00:42:09,892
The one that used to
hang around the garage.

471
00:42:10,022 --> 00:42:14,718
He'd get on top of your car and take off
when you pulled out of the driveway.

472
00:42:14,848 --> 00:42:17,024
Yeah, I remember.

473
00:42:18,155 --> 00:42:23,546
I remember how scared I used to get,
that whoosh...

474
00:42:23,633 --> 00:42:26,155
every time I started the car.

475
00:42:26,286 --> 00:42:30,157
Yeah. That was the closest
we ever came to having a pet.

476
00:42:31,677 --> 00:42:36,288
You remember Buck tried
to talk you into getting a dog?

477
00:42:36,418 --> 00:42:40,375
He said "How about if it's just
the size of a little football?"

478
00:42:40,897 --> 00:42:45,810
You know, that animal next door,
that Pepper or Pippin or whatever...

479
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:47,245
Pippin.

480
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:51,029
He's not a very friendly dog.
I don't care what Mr. McGreary says...

481
00:42:51,116 --> 00:42:53,246
What he really wanted
was a retriever...

482
00:42:53,332 --> 00:42:56,159
Every time that dog
comes into this back yard...

483
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:06,160
Put that on if you're
gonna stay out here, OK?

484
00:43:44,993 --> 00:43:47,254
- Can I help?
- Help what?

485
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:50,296
You mean with this? No.

486
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:54,167
- I will.
- No, I tell you what you can do, though.

487
00:43:54,255 --> 00:43:58,082
You can upstairs to that room of yours
and clean out the closet.

488
00:43:58,212 --> 00:44:00,733
- Mom...
- OK?

489
00:44:01,995 --> 00:44:04,690
Because it really is a mess.

490
00:44:18,432 --> 00:44:19,824
.

491
00:44:19,911 --> 00:44:21,346
Oh, hi.

492
00:44:21,476 --> 00:44:25,346
Yeah, I didn't get there.
I was swamped with work. How'd it go?

493
00:44:25,476 --> 00:44:29,390
No, I'm not doing anything,
just getting ready for dinner.

494
00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:33,477
Did she really?

495
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:40,044
Anyway, Mary Ann Raymond
started to just scream, just cry.

496
00:44:40,131 --> 00:44:43,740
It was crazy. We got so drunk
that we couldn't talk to each other.

497
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:46,262
It was the last day of school.

498
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:49,523
We walked right out of the building
in the middle of class!

499
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,741
Oh, Bucky!

500
00:44:53,436 --> 00:44:55,740
No, stop!

501
00:44:57,697 --> 00:45:01,089
- What do you expect from her?
- We just don't connect.

502
00:45:01,221 --> 00:45:04,133
- Why not?
- I don't know. We just don't.

503
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:16,830
What are you thinking?

504
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:21,441
That I jack off a lot.

505
00:45:21,571 --> 00:45:25,181
So what else is new? Does it help?

506
00:45:25,311 --> 00:45:27,397
for a minute.

507
00:45:35,138 --> 00:45:37,225
What now?

508
00:45:40,226 --> 00:45:42,704
- John Boy.
- Who?

509
00:45:43,443 --> 00:45:45,966
<i>You know, in the Waltons, John Boy?</i>

510
00:45:46,097 --> 00:45:48,140
Yeah. What about him?

511
00:45:50,487 --> 00:45:53,967
My father came into my room
and he didn't know what to say.

512
00:45:54,097 --> 00:45:56,880
This was right after Buck died.

513
00:45:58,271 --> 00:46:02,316
He sat on the bed next to me,
he put his arm around my shoulder.

514
00:46:02,446 --> 00:46:06,490
We just sat there.
I remember I was watching his shoe,

515
00:46:07,534 --> 00:46:09,576
and thinking...

516
00:46:09,664 --> 00:46:11,838
Cos his shoe was turned
over on its side.

517
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:15,927
I was thinking "He's so uptight
it's gonna crack off."

518
00:46:19,145 --> 00:46:24,841
I knew I should have felt something.
But I didn't know what to feel.

519
00:46:24,927 --> 00:46:29,929
I kept thinking what they say on TV,
stuff like "Oh, no" and "Oh, my God".

520
00:46:31,407 --> 00:46:34,624
I didn't say them
because I didn't feel sad...

521
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:38,408
so much as...

522
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:44,060
So much as what?

523
00:46:44,538 --> 00:46:49,453
I kept thinking that John Boy would
have said something about how he felt.

524
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,061
What would John Boy have said?

525
00:46:54,409 --> 00:46:56,584
I don't know.

526
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,757
Come on.

527
00:47:03,194 --> 00:47:06,497
- Come on.
- Come on what?

528
00:47:06,627 --> 00:47:08,889
Don't hold back.

529
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,631
At least she's an improvement.
She doesn't crack gum in your face.

530
00:47:19,761 --> 00:47:23,066
That's what you get when your partner
does the hirin' and firin'.

531
00:47:23,197 --> 00:47:25,111
I'm sorry. That's my fault.

532
00:47:25,241 --> 00:47:29,806
I just can never seem to tell anybody
that they're not making it.

533
00:47:32,676 --> 00:47:34,764
Wait a minute.

534
00:47:36,197 --> 00:47:38,503
That's not the problem.

535
00:47:38,634 --> 00:47:40,677
- Where are you?
- What?

536
00:47:40,807 --> 00:47:43,286
I've been losing you these days.

537
00:47:45,678 --> 00:47:48,591
- I'm sorry.
- That's OK.

538
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:51,678
You're off the track?

539
00:47:53,331 --> 00:47:57,549
I've known you for 20 years. You think
I can't tell when something's wrong?

540
00:47:57,635 --> 00:48:00,418
- How's Connie?
- Connie's all right.

541
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,984
He is. He's OK.

542
00:48:05,898 --> 00:48:09,897
Look, it's none of my business,
but I think you worry too much.

543
00:48:09,985 --> 00:48:13,855
You've been on the rack about him
long enough. You're making it a habit.

544
00:48:13,941 --> 00:48:17,334
- You've gotta let him go sometime.
- I'm not on the rack about him.

545
00:48:17,464 --> 00:48:20,422
The thing about it is
in a year he'll be gone.

546
00:48:20,552 --> 00:48:25,378
Off to Michigan or Harvard or wherever
he gets it in his head he wants to go.

547
00:48:25,509 --> 00:48:30,250
Maybe he'll decide to take a tour of
Europe and not even go to school at all.

548
00:48:30,336 --> 00:48:33,597
- Who knows?
- I can't argue with "Who knows?"

549
00:48:33,727 --> 00:48:36,294
I'm just giving you
the benefit of my experience.

550
00:48:36,381 --> 00:48:38,599
Thanks.

551
00:48:38,729 --> 00:48:42,946
With Valerie, it's more than
her living away from home. She's gone.

552
00:48:43,077 --> 00:48:46,034
Got her own friends, her own life.

553
00:48:46,164 --> 00:48:49,731
She breezes in for a couple of days
on vacations, but...

554
00:48:51,731 --> 00:48:54,382
I don't know, maybe girls are different.

555
00:48:55,382 --> 00:48:59,775
Or maybe she was too aware of what
was happening between Nance and me.

556
00:48:59,862 --> 00:49:01,384
But they leave.

557
00:49:01,514 --> 00:49:06,645
And all that worrying doesn't amount to
a hill of crap. It's just wasted energy.

558
00:49:12,341 --> 00:49:15,471
Give me back my sweater!
Come on, it's my sweater!

559
00:49:15,602 --> 00:49:17,647
- Possession is nine-tenths...
- Hang on.

560
00:49:17,777 --> 00:49:20,735
- Dad, what's possession?
- Wait...

561
00:49:20,865 --> 00:49:23,040
- Give it to me.
- I can't. It's already on me.

562
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,256
Wait. Whose sweater is it?

563
00:49:25,387 --> 00:49:28,648
- It's my sweater.
- OK, I'll give it back to you

564
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:31,431
if you give me back
my hockey stick and my skis.

565
00:49:31,562 --> 00:49:33,302
All right.

566
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,692
Conrad!

567
00:49:38,215 --> 00:49:39,737
- Conrad!
- What is it?

568
00:49:40,172 --> 00:49:42,215
Watch your back.

569
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,346
Cuts are vertical.
He really meant business.

570
00:49:45,433 --> 00:49:47,346
Let's go.

571
00:49:48,432 --> 00:49:51,042
Lake forest is next.

572
00:50:48,138 --> 00:50:52,528
What is it you want?
I don't know what else to do for you.

573
00:50:52,659 --> 00:50:55,182
I'm not asking you to do anything.

574
00:50:55,312 --> 00:50:58,009
You gotta be kiddin' me. I don't get it.

575
00:50:59,095 --> 00:51:02,923
I excuse you from practice mice
a week so you can see some shrink.

576
00:51:03,008 --> 00:51:06,357
I work with you every damn night
at your convenience.

577
00:51:06,488 --> 00:51:09,270
What the hell more
am I supposed to do for you?

578
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:11,053
Nothing.

579
00:51:11,446 --> 00:51:14,271
Bright kid like you,
everything goin' for you.

580
00:51:14,401 --> 00:51:18,358
I don't get it. Why do you
wanna keep messin' up your life?

581
00:51:18,488 --> 00:51:22,403
I don't think quitting swimming
will mess up my life.

582
00:51:24,143 --> 00:51:26,621
I really don't.

583
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,144
OK.

584
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,449
- OK. Now, this is it.
- Yeah.

585
00:51:36,535 --> 00:51:40,189
You're a big kid now.
Actions have consequences.

586
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,928
- I'm not taking you back again.
- I won't ask you to, sir.

587
00:52:07,062 --> 00:52:10,322
- What happened? You all right?
- Yeah.

588
00:52:10,452 --> 00:52:12,756
- Salan says you quit the swim team.
- Yeah.

589
00:52:12,889 --> 00:52:15,976
- Why?
- I don't know. I felt like it was a bore.

590
00:52:16,889 --> 00:52:19,802
- That's not a real reason.
- Well, that's the way it is.

591
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:22,237
- What happened?
- Nothin'.

592
00:52:22,324 --> 00:52:25,630
- Connie, talk to me.
- Swimming's a bore, that's all.

593
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,630
- I talked to Salan...
- Well, quit talkin' to people! OK?

594
00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:33,457
Holy shit. Yeah, sure.

595
00:52:34,413 --> 00:52:36,674
fuck you, Jarrett.

596
00:52:40,806 --> 00:52:44,197
- Leave it alone.
- I told you the guy's a flake.

597
00:52:50,416 --> 00:52:53,894
- What does your dad say about it?
- I haven't told him yet.

598
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:56,242
How come?

599
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:58,720
I don't know. The timing isn't right.

600
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:02,504
He sweats everything so much,
he'll just get worried about it.

601
00:53:02,634 --> 00:53:05,634
- Can you tell your mother?
- My mother and I don't connect.

602
00:53:05,764 --> 00:53:07,983
Don't you listen? I told you that.

603
00:53:08,069 --> 00:53:12,549
What do people have in common with
mothers anyway? It's all surface junk.

604
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:17,505
You know, clean your room,
brush your teeth, get good grades...

605
00:53:19,158 --> 00:53:22,812
I'm just wasting money today.
I'm not gonna feel anything. I'm sorry.

606
00:53:22,942 --> 00:53:26,029
No, sorry's out.
Come on, something's on your mind.

607
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:29,551
- What time is it?
- Never mind the time. There's time.

608
00:53:30,638 --> 00:53:33,987
Look. Remember the contract?
Control?

609
00:53:34,596 --> 00:53:39,421
Maybe there's a connection
between control and... lack of feeling.

610
00:53:39,552 --> 00:53:41,683
- I said I feel things.
- When?

611
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:43,857
God, come on.

612
00:53:45,467 --> 00:53:47,074
- When?
- I don't know...

613
00:53:47,206 --> 00:53:49,987
- I thought you didn't like to fool around.
- I'm not.

614
00:53:50,076 --> 00:53:53,033
- Like to play games, do you?
- I don't. What do you want?

615
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,817
I want you to leave "I don't know"
on the table with the magazines.

616
00:53:56,947 --> 00:53:58,641
You want me to make answers up?

617
00:53:58,772 --> 00:54:01,903
Yeah. Make one up about
how there's no feelings in there.

618
00:54:02,034 --> 00:54:05,556
- I said I have feelings.
- Now you have 'em, now you don't.

619
00:54:05,686 --> 00:54:08,382
- Why are you trying to make me mad?
- Are you mad?

620
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:11,557
- No!
- Cut the shit. You're mad as hell.

621
00:54:11,687 --> 00:54:15,209
You don't like being pushed, so do
something about it. Tell me to fuck off!

622
00:54:15,297 --> 00:54:17,993
Well, fuck o... No, I can't do this.

623
00:54:18,123 --> 00:54:20,297
- Why not, kid?
- I can't do this. No.

624
00:54:20,385 --> 00:54:24,255
- It takes too much energy to get mad.
- And how much energy to hold it back?

625
00:54:24,385 --> 00:54:27,168
When I let myself feel, all I feel is lousy.

626
00:54:27,298 --> 00:54:31,081
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I never promised you a rose garden.

627
00:54:31,211 --> 00:54:33,994
- fuck you, Berger. fuck you.
- Yeah?

628
00:54:34,124 --> 00:54:35,647
- fuck you!
- That's it.

629
00:54:35,735 --> 00:54:38,474
Jesus, you're really weird.
What do you feel, huh?

630
00:54:38,604 --> 00:54:41,778
- Do you jack off, jerk off, whatever?
- What do you think?

631
00:54:41,864 --> 00:54:46,171
I think you're married to a fat lady
and fuck the living daylights out of her!

632
00:54:46,301 --> 00:54:48,388
Sounds good to me.

633
00:55:02,347 --> 00:55:06,738
A little advice about feeling, kiddo.
Don't expect it always to tickle.

634
00:55:10,521 --> 00:55:15,477
- Mother, do you know how to aim that?
- Be quiet. I have to concentrate.

635
00:55:15,564 --> 00:55:17,914
- Smile, everybody.
- Is it in focus?

636
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,958
Smile.

637
00:55:20,088 --> 00:55:23,828
OK, good. Now I wanna take
the three young ones.

638
00:55:24,957 --> 00:55:27,654
- Dad, will you get outta there?
- Oh, all right.

639
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:31,438
And be quiet. Be quiet.

640
00:55:31,568 --> 00:55:33,395
Conrad, where are you?

641
00:55:33,525 --> 00:55:36,699
In the middle,
between your mother and father.

642
00:55:36,785 --> 00:55:41,004
- All right, smile, everybody.
- You're taller than your mother.

643
00:55:41,918 --> 00:55:45,091
- All right, smile.
- This is beautiful. Hold it level.

644
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:48,658
Wonderful. OK, now I want
to take Cal and Beth.

645
00:55:49,092 --> 00:55:51,179
Great. Sure.

646
00:55:51,309 --> 00:55:54,354
- Come on. You can do better than that.
- Hold it...

647
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:57,701
Connie. I wanna take a picture
of Connie and his mother.

648
00:55:57,831 --> 00:56:01,484
No, let's get the three men in there
and I'll take a picture of you.

649
00:56:01,615 --> 00:56:04,180
Connie, move in closer to your mother.

650
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:07,007
- Prize winner.
- That's great.

651
00:56:07,659 --> 00:56:10,007
- Do it.
- Page one, Lake Forester,

652
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:13,834
- This is marvellous.
- Shoot, I didn't cock it.

653
00:56:13,965 --> 00:56:17,357
- Calvin...
- Hold it. Connie, smile.

654
00:56:18,269 --> 00:56:20,314
- Calvin.
- Just a second. Smile.

655
00:56:20,444 --> 00:56:23,314
- Calvin, give me the camera.
- I didn't get it yet.

656
00:56:23,445 --> 00:56:26,793
- Dad, give her the camera.
- I want a good picture of you mo.

657
00:56:26,923 --> 00:56:29,619
But I really want to get
a shot of you men.

658
00:56:29,705 --> 00:56:32,881
- Give me the camera.
- Not until I get a picture of you mo.

659
00:56:32,967 --> 00:56:35,316
- Cal.
- Give her the goddamn camera!

660
00:56:54,231 --> 00:56:55,971
Smile.

661
00:56:59,841 --> 00:57:02,449
Who's hungry?
I'll make the sandwiches.

662
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:18,147
Beth.

663
00:57:18,277 --> 00:57:20,539
I think it can be saved.

664
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:25,671
That was dumb. It was just so dumb.

665
00:57:30,019 --> 00:57:32,498
I don't think he's happy in school.

666
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:37,672
Have you talked to his teachers?

667
00:57:37,803 --> 00:57:41,846
I don't think people want to be with him.
He provokes people.

668
00:57:41,933 --> 00:57:45,804
Well... Here, why don't you do this?
It's an awkward age.

669
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,761
Maybe he needs a change.

670
00:57:50,413 --> 00:57:54,283
- Are you sure he's eating enough?
- Yes, Mother, of course.

671
00:57:54,369 --> 00:57:57,892
I think he'll be all right -
if you are firm with him.

672
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,371
I think maybe he should
go away to school.

673
00:58:02,458 --> 00:58:05,849
I just don't know
how to deal with him any more.

674
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,545
Who would make that decision?

675
00:58:08,632 --> 00:58:12,328
I don't know. I suppose
this doctor he's seeing.

676
00:58:12,459 --> 00:58:15,242
What sort of doctor would
make that decision for you?

677
00:58:15,373 --> 00:58:17,547
A psychiatrist.

678
00:58:17,633 --> 00:58:20,069
I thought we were finished with that.

679
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:22,635
No.

680
00:58:22,722 --> 00:58:25,243
- What's his name?
- Berger.

681
00:58:26,027 --> 00:58:29,505
- Jewish doctor?
- I don't know. I suppose he's Jewish.

682
00:58:29,636 --> 00:58:31,679
Maybe just German.

683
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:35,289
What does Cal say about all this?

684
00:58:36,986 --> 00:58:40,724
You know, I think this can be saved.
It's a nice clean break.

685
00:58:55,682 --> 00:58:59,466
OK. Altos, that last E natural
could be just a little higher.

686
00:58:59,553 --> 00:59:03,292
Officers, don't forget
your meeting tonight. That's it.

687
00:59:22,905 --> 00:59:24,817
Hi, Jeannine.

688
00:59:24,903 --> 00:59:27,470
You are really a terrific tenor.

689
00:59:28,123 --> 00:59:32,384
In fact, you should be the one
doing the solo in that Russian thing.

690
00:59:32,471 --> 00:59:33,515
No, I.

691
00:59:33,645 --> 00:59:36,862
I'm serious. You sing well.
I'm getting to know your voice.

692
00:59:36,993 --> 00:59:39,080
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

693
00:59:39,167 --> 00:59:41,906
How can you hear me sing
if you're singing?

694
00:59:42,776 --> 00:59:46,167
Well, I don't always sing.
Sometimes I just listen.

695
00:59:47,342 --> 00:59:50,299
for instance, Marsha Blair
can't sing a note.

696
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:54,300
Janet fox only mouths the words
and never sings.

697
00:59:55,778 --> 00:59:57,343
- A detective.
- Yeah.

698
00:59:58,473 --> 01:00:00,735
Do you like Vivaldi?

699
01:00:00,865 --> 01:00:04,257
- Telemann?
- Telemann?

700
01:00:04,387 --> 01:00:06,910
What kind of music do you like?

701
01:00:08,865 --> 01:00:13,519
Modern jazz, I like.
folk rock, spoon on a glass...

702
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:17,477
Spoon on a glass?

703
01:00:22,173 --> 01:00:25,434
Oh, you mean like tablespoon.

704
01:00:27,565 --> 01:00:29,652
Oh, dear.

705
01:00:31,174 --> 01:00:34,131
Why do I ask dumb questions?

706
01:00:34,217 --> 01:00:36,741
I'm just showing off.

707
01:00:40,957 --> 01:00:44,263
Why is it so hard the first time
you talk to somebody?

708
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,437
You make it look easy.

709
01:00:50,786 --> 01:00:52,872
Really?

710
01:00:55,264 --> 01:00:57,960
That's my bus. I gotta go.

711
01:00:58,439 --> 01:01:00,308
I'll see you later.

712
01:01:02,439 --> 01:01:04,744
And you're really a terrific tenor.

713
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:07,917
Are you just saying that?

714
01:02:04,795 --> 01:02:06,840
<i>- Hello?
- Hello. Is Karen there?</i>

715
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:11,405
<i>- Who's calling, please?
- It's a friend of hers from Hillsboro.</i>

716
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,841
<i>Well, she's not home from school yet.</i>

717
01:02:20,276 --> 01:02:23,495
Well, just tell her I called.
This is Conrad calling.

718
01:02:23,625 --> 01:02:26,582
Tell her I'm feeling great
and I just wanted to talk to her.

719
01:02:26,712 --> 01:02:29,190
<i>- Yes, I will.
- OK. Thank you.</i>

720
01:03:05,455 --> 01:03:07,282
All right.

721
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:14,544
Hello, Jeannine. This is Conrad.

722
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:18,284
Hello, Jeannine. This is Conrad.

723
01:03:26,285 --> 01:03:28,938
Hello, Jeannine. This is Conrad.

724
01:03:29,634 --> 01:03:31,504
Conrad.

725
01:03:31,635 --> 01:03:34,417
Conrad? What a dumb name.

726
01:03:35,155 --> 01:03:38,069
Hello, Jeannine. This is Bill.

727
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:47,809
<i>- Hello?
- Hello... Hello, this is...</i>

728
01:03:48,766 --> 01:03:51,898
Hello, this is Conrad calling. Jarrett?

729
01:03:52,898 --> 01:03:54,462
<i>Oh, hi.</i>

730
01:03:54,811 --> 01:04:00,289
Hi. Listen, I was wondering if
maybe you'd like to go out sometime?

731
01:04:00,421 --> 01:04:03,159
<i>You mean with you? Like on a date?</i>

732
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:05,682
Well, we wouldn't have
to call it a real date.

733
01:04:05,769 --> 01:04:08,551
We could fake it, sort of,
see how it goes.

734
01:04:10,118 --> 01:04:13,074
<i>That was dumb. Just forget it.
Now start over.</i>

735
01:04:13,814 --> 01:04:17,119
<i>- Hi, this is Conrad Jarrett.
- I'd love to. When?</i>

736
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:54,775
I didn't see you there.
What do you think?

737
01:04:55,211 --> 01:04:56,558
It's fine.

738
01:04:56,689 --> 01:04:59,473
Rawlins used to have
such great, full Scotch pines

739
01:04:59,603 --> 01:05:02,385
and they all look like
skeletons this year.

740
01:05:03,298 --> 01:05:05,602
Hi. What do you think?

741
01:05:07,822 --> 01:05:09,865
Very nice.

742
01:05:11,648 --> 01:05:14,212
- What's wrong?
- Why don't you ask him?

743
01:05:14,604 --> 01:05:16,778
Then you won't hear it
from Carol Lazenby.

744
01:05:16,909 --> 01:05:19,562
Hear what?

745
01:05:23,866 --> 01:05:26,607
- Dad, I quit the swim team.
- What?

746
01:05:26,737 --> 01:05:30,912
Carol thought I knew. Why wouldn't I?
It happened over a month ago.

747
01:05:31,042 --> 01:05:33,390
Quit? When?

748
01:05:33,913 --> 01:05:37,303
- Where have you been every night?
- Around. The library mostly.

749
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:40,956
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I didn't think it mattered.

750
01:05:41,086 --> 01:05:44,044
- Of course it matters.
- That was meant for me, Calvin.

751
01:05:44,174 --> 01:05:46,739
- What was?
- It's important to hurt me, isn't it?

752
01:05:46,826 --> 01:05:50,088
- Don't you have that backwards?
- Oh? How do I hurt you?

753
01:05:50,218 --> 01:05:52,783
By embarrassing you
in front of a friend?

754
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:56,871
Poor Beth! She has no idea what her
son does. He lies and she believes him.

755
01:05:56,958 --> 01:06:00,653
- I didn't lie.
- You lied every time you came in late!

756
01:06:00,784 --> 01:06:05,046
If it's starting again, the lying,
the disappearing, I will not stand for it.

757
01:06:05,133 --> 01:06:06,569
I really can't!

758
01:06:06,698 --> 01:06:08,568
- Don't then! Go to Europe!
- Connie...

759
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:13,395
The only reason she gives a fuck
about it is cos someone else knew first!

760
01:06:13,526 --> 01:06:16,135
- Just stop it, Connie...
- Tell her to stop it!

761
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:20,004
You never tell her a thing! I know
why she never came to the hospital.

762
01:06:20,135 --> 01:06:23,484
She was busy going to goddamn Spain
and goddamn Portugal!

763
01:06:23,614 --> 01:06:25,962
Why should she care
if I'm hung up by the balls?

764
01:06:26,094 --> 01:06:30,049
Maybe this is how they talk
at the hospital, but we're not there now.

765
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:33,703
- You never came to the hospital!
- Your mother did come.

766
01:06:33,833 --> 01:06:36,181
She had flu and couldn't come inside.

767
01:06:36,312 --> 01:06:39,702
She wouldn't have had flu
if Buck was in the hospital.

768
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:44,269
- Buck never would've been in there!
- That's enough!

769
01:06:45,487 --> 01:06:49,835
- I won't do it again. I really won't.
- What in hell has happened?

770
01:06:49,923 --> 01:06:54,313
- Somebody better go up there.
- Oh, God! That's the pattern, isn't it?

771
01:06:54,443 --> 01:06:56,879
He walks all over us
and you go and apologise.

772
01:06:56,967 --> 01:06:59,880
- I'm not going to apologise...
- Of course you are.

773
01:06:59,966 --> 01:07:03,533
You've been apologizing to him
ever since he got out of the hospital.

774
01:07:03,663 --> 01:07:06,706
I'm not apologizing. I am trying
to goddamn understand him!

775
01:07:06,836 --> 01:07:10,534
Don't talk to me that way.
Don't talk to me the way he talks to you.

776
01:07:10,664 --> 01:07:13,620
Beth, let's not fight, OK?

777
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:16,099
No fighting, OK?

778
01:07:16,186 --> 01:07:17,839
Please.

779
01:07:17,969 --> 01:07:20,317
Let's go upstairs.

780
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:40,407
- I wanna talk to you.
- I need to sleep.

781
01:07:40,537 --> 01:07:41,581
In a minute.

782
01:07:41,711 --> 01:07:45,364
I didn't mean any of it.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad.

783
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,234
I'm not. I just want
to figure out what happened.

784
01:07:48,364 --> 01:07:52,626
I don't know what happened. I'm sorry
about what I said. I didn't mean it.

785
01:07:52,756 --> 01:07:56,235
Just please tell her.
Tell her I'm sorry, will you?

786
01:07:56,365 --> 01:07:58,844
- Why don't you tell her?
- Oh, God! No, I can't!

787
01:07:58,931 --> 01:08:01,323
Don't you see? I can't talk to her.

788
01:08:02,193 --> 01:08:03,627
Why not?

789
01:08:03,758 --> 01:08:07,801
Because it doesn't change
the way she looks at me.

790
01:08:07,933 --> 01:08:12,454
She was upset. Your mother was hurt
because you quit the swim team.

791
01:08:12,585 --> 01:08:14,542
I don't understand it myself.

792
01:08:14,672 --> 01:08:18,889
No, I don't mean just now.
Don't you see? I don't mean just today.

793
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:21,238
- What then? Explain it to me.
- I can't.

794
01:08:21,326 --> 01:08:24,153
It's all Jell-O and pudding with you.
You don't see things.

795
01:08:24,284 --> 01:08:26,935
What things?

796
01:08:27,066 --> 01:08:30,414
What things?
Please, I want you to tell me.

797
01:08:30,631 --> 01:08:33,327
That she hates me. Can't you see that?

798
01:08:33,457 --> 01:08:35,502
Your mother doesn't hate you.

799
01:08:35,588 --> 01:08:38,546
All right. You're right. She doesn't.

800
01:08:38,634 --> 01:08:40,937
Please leave me alone now.

801
01:08:53,808 --> 01:08:56,417
What about this Dr. Berger?
Is he helping you?

802
01:08:56,548 --> 01:08:59,418
Don't blame it on Berger.
It's not his fault.

803
01:09:05,027 --> 01:09:07,375
I'll be downstairs if you need me.

804
01:09:12,114 --> 01:09:16,246
Tuesday you felt great. You bought
a Christmas tree, it was all hunky-dory.

805
01:09:16,333 --> 01:09:18,420
You're the doctor.

806
01:09:20,508 --> 01:09:23,595
Don't take refuge in one-liners
like "You're the doctor".

807
01:09:23,725 --> 01:09:26,421
- That pisses me off.
- OK.

808
01:09:28,335 --> 01:09:32,292
It was fine until you had the fight
with your mother. Then it was lousy.

809
01:09:32,423 --> 01:09:35,944
Yeah, but I don't blame her.
She's got her reasons.

810
01:09:36,074 --> 01:09:38,380
It's impossible after the shit I've pulled.

811
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:40,772
What shit have you pulled?

812
01:09:43,077 --> 01:09:47,728
Remember, I'm talking proportion here.
Now, what shit?

813
01:09:50,468 --> 01:09:54,165
Come on. You must be able to come up
with at least one example.

814
01:09:54,252 --> 01:09:56,469
"I tried to kill myself' is old turkey.

815
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,643
- What have you done lately?
- Lately?

816
01:09:58,773 --> 01:10:02,905
Come on. Listen, I'm never
gonna be forgiven for that. Never!

817
01:10:04,165 --> 01:10:09,644
You can't get it out.
All the blood in her towels, in her rug...

818
01:10:10,515 --> 01:10:16,081
Everything had to be pitched. Even
the bathroom tiles had to be re-grouted.

819
01:10:17,253 --> 01:10:22,168
Christ, she fired the maid because
she couldn't dust the living room right.

820
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:27,387
If you think I'm gonna forgive...
that she's gonna forgive me...

821
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:36,171
What?

822
01:10:55,172 --> 01:10:58,086
I think I just figured something out.

823
01:10:58,608 --> 01:11:00,695
What?

824
01:11:01,825 --> 01:11:04,783
Who it is who can't forgive who.

825
01:11:09,654 --> 01:11:12,740
Well, a real problem has a real solution.

826
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:15,045
I've heard this all before.

827
01:11:15,175 --> 01:11:18,828
- That doesn't make it any less true.
- I'm so tired.

828
01:11:20,045 --> 01:11:23,742
Well, that's a hell of a secret
you've been keeping to yourself.

829
01:11:23,873 --> 01:11:26,178
So what do I do now?

830
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:30,135
Recognize her limitations.

831
01:11:31,135 --> 01:11:36,614
- You mean, like she can't love me?
- Kiddo, no. She can't love you enough.

832
01:11:36,962 --> 01:11:40,528
Don't blame her for not loving you
more than she's able.

833
01:11:41,006 --> 01:11:45,397
But she loves my father.
I know she loved my brother.

834
01:11:46,179 --> 01:11:48,136
It's me.

835
01:11:48,224 --> 01:11:50,789
Now we're back
to the rotten-kid routine.

836
01:11:50,919 --> 01:11:53,660
She can't love you
because you're unlovable.

837
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:57,659
How come your dad loves you?
You're a rotten kid.

838
01:11:57,790 --> 01:12:02,834
That's different. He feels responsible.
Besides, he loves everybody.

839
01:12:03,530 --> 01:12:07,399
I get it. The guy's got no taste.
He loves you, but he's wrong.

840
01:12:08,444 --> 01:12:10,531
Look...

841
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:14,792
Maybe she just can't express it
the way you'd like her to.

842
01:12:15,966 --> 01:12:19,141
Maybe she's just afraid
to show you what she feels.

843
01:12:19,271 --> 01:12:20,793
What do you mean?

844
01:12:20,924 --> 01:12:23,838
There's someone besides your mother
you gotta forgive.

845
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:26,273
You mean me?

846
01:12:29,664 --> 01:12:32,099
for trying to off myself?

847
01:12:33,229 --> 01:12:35,883
Don't just stare at me. What for?

848
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:39,753
Why don't you give yourself a break?
Let yourself off the hook?

849
01:12:39,883 --> 01:12:42,101
What did I do?

850
01:12:42,622 --> 01:12:44,102
What did I do?

851
01:12:44,188 --> 01:12:46,710
- We'll talk about it on Thursday.
- Come on!

852
01:12:46,840 --> 01:12:48,885
- Time's up.
- You're gonna pull the plug?

853
01:12:49,016 --> 01:12:50,536
What did I do?

854
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:54,276
- Come on, Con. You know the rules.
- Can't I have a few minutes?

855
01:12:54,363 --> 01:12:57,146
You think about it. Just think about it.

856
01:13:00,233 --> 01:13:02,278
Jesus.

857
01:13:05,755 --> 01:13:08,105
Say, after going to a new high,

858
01:13:08,235 --> 01:13:12,365
it falls to 112'/4,
then rallies on good volume.

859
01:13:13,148 --> 01:13:16,105
I shoot an order to buy
four thou at the market.

860
01:13:16,235 --> 01:13:20,496
If I get the 4,000 shares at 1 133/4,
I know something's wrong.

861
01:13:20,628 --> 01:13:25,715
But suppose the order I put in to buy
the shares when the price was 1 133/4,

862
01:13:25,803 --> 01:13:30,543
I get 2,000 at 114, 500 at 114'/4,
and the rest on the way up,

863
01:13:30,673 --> 01:13:35,065
so the last 500 shares I pay 115'/2,

864
01:13:35,152 --> 01:13:37,369
then I know I'm right.

865
01:13:37,499 --> 01:13:39,674
- I'm gonna peel off here.
- OK.

866
01:13:39,804 --> 01:13:42,240
- I'll see you, Cal.
- See you later.

867
01:13:46,935 --> 01:13:49,718
<i>Suppose the order I put in
to buy the shares...</i>

868
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:52,937
<i>He walks all over us
and you go and apologise.</i>

869
01:13:53,067 --> 01:13:54,372
<i>..500 at 114'/4...</i>

870
01:13:54,459 --> 01:13:57,589
<i>It's all Jell-O and pudding with you.
You don't see things.</i>

871
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:01,460
<i>You've been apologizing
ever since he got out of the hospital.</i>

872
01:14:01,546 --> 01:14:03,982
<i>Tell her to stop it!
You never tell her a thing!</i>

873
01:14:04,112 --> 01:14:06,025
<i>Buck never would've been in there!</i>

874
01:14:06,155 --> 01:14:08,851
<i>She hates me! Can't you see that?</i>

875
01:14:30,203 --> 01:14:33,682
- I wanna be clear.
- That's good.

876
01:14:35,595 --> 01:14:40,073
In the car, I was thinking "Be clear".

877
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:48,510
Well, I suppose that's what psychiatry
is about - being precise and clear.

878
01:14:49,509 --> 01:14:51,857
And honest, of course.

879
01:14:52,336 --> 01:14:55,937
I'll level with you. I'm not
a great believer in psychiatry.

880
01:14:56,223 --> 01:14:57,250
OK.

881
01:14:57,381 --> 01:15:01,120
I know what happens here is only
between you and him, and I like that.

882
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:05,163
I respect that,
and he's better, I can see that.

883
01:15:05,816 --> 01:15:10,948
I'm not putting you down. I just don't
believe in psychiatry as a panacea.

884
01:15:11,077 --> 01:15:13,164
Neither do I.

885
01:15:17,426 --> 01:15:20,122
I wish I knew
what the hell I was doin' here.

886
01:15:20,992 --> 01:15:24,862
You said you thought you could
shed some light on some things.

887
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:29,341
- What did you mean by that?
- I think I meant in terms of Conrad.

888
01:15:29,471 --> 01:15:33,950
You see, I knew something was wrong
even before he tried to kill himself,

889
01:15:34,037 --> 01:15:36,124
but I thought that.

890
01:15:38,299 --> 01:15:41,995
It's clear that he's very smart.
He's always been an A student,

891
01:15:42,127 --> 01:15:48,000
and naturally I thought that intelligent
people could work out their problems.

892
01:15:49,823 --> 01:15:53,084
- But you still feel responsible.
- Yeah, sure I do.

893
01:15:53,388 --> 01:15:55,430
It's hard not to.

894
01:15:56,257 --> 01:16:00,171
It was luck. It was just luck that
I happened to be there when he tried it.

895
01:16:00,302 --> 01:16:04,607
I could have been at a meeting. We both
could have been away. It was luck.

896
01:16:04,694 --> 01:16:06,867
So you think of yourself as a lucky man.

897
01:16:06,998 --> 01:16:08,346
No.

898
01:16:08,477 --> 01:16:11,390
No. I used to.

899
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:17,086
I used to think that I was a lucky person
before... the accident.

900
01:16:23,523 --> 01:16:25,828
I guess life's nothing but an accident.

901
01:16:25,959 --> 01:16:29,262
What happens to you,
what you do with it.

902
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:33,264
That sounds more like the philosophy
of a drifter than a tax attorney.

903
01:16:33,394 --> 01:16:35,742
Maybe I am drifting a little.

904
01:16:37,743 --> 01:16:42,177
I can see myself, and I can see
the mo of them drifting away from me,

905
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,874
and I just stand there watching.

906
01:16:45,917 --> 01:16:48,484
- What do you want to do about that?
- Something.

907
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:50,743
I've gotta do something about it.

908
01:16:50,874 --> 01:16:54,222
I feel like I'm sitting on a fence
and I don't like it.

909
01:16:54,961 --> 01:16:58,048
And you see them as on
opposite sides of this fence.

910
01:16:58,180 --> 01:16:59,441
Yeah.

911
01:16:59,571 --> 01:17:02,136
No. I don't know.

912
01:17:03,136 --> 01:17:06,050
I see her not being able to forgive him.

913
01:17:08,484 --> 01:17:11,310
- for what?
- I don't know exactly.

914
01:17:12,572 --> 01:17:14,920
Being too much like her.

915
01:17:15,008 --> 01:17:19,400
People always think that
she and Buck are... were alike.

916
01:17:20,835 --> 01:17:23,095
But it's really she and Conrad.

917
01:17:24,357 --> 01:17:28,402
They were the only mo that didn't cry
at the funeral, you know?

918
01:17:29,619 --> 01:17:32,967
It's not easy for me to admit this,

919
01:17:33,097 --> 01:17:35,618
but she didn't...

920
01:17:41,273 --> 01:17:43,577
His mother doesn't show him
much affection.

921
01:17:43,707 --> 01:17:47,403
I'm not trying to put her down
in any way. She is a wonderful woman.

922
01:17:47,491 --> 01:17:50,274
Did she give much affection to Buck?

923
01:17:50,578 --> 01:17:52,883
God, yes! She loved Buck.

924
01:17:53,014 --> 01:17:55,100
Bucky got so much...

925
01:17:56,056 --> 01:17:58,448
I think what she felt
for him was special.

926
01:17:58,578 --> 01:18:01,797
He was her first-born.
That's not unusual, is it?

927
01:18:02,145 --> 01:18:04,449
- And you?
- Me? I loved Buck.

928
01:18:05,275 --> 01:18:07,754
What I mean is, your wife's affection.

929
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,145
- for me, you mean?
- Yes.

930
01:18:11,189 --> 01:18:13,146
Well, she's very...

931
01:18:15,277 --> 01:18:18,320
No, there's no problem with her for me.

932
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:21,234
We've been married nearly 21 years.

933
01:18:22,147 --> 01:18:24,235
Everybody loves Beth.

934
01:18:24,322 --> 01:18:27,148
But for Conrad it's been difficult.

935
01:18:27,974 --> 01:18:30,019
He didn't talk about that?

936
01:18:30,323 --> 01:18:33,932
We don't know what happens here.
It doesn't come up.

937
01:18:39,498 --> 01:18:42,019
I guess that's what it is.

938
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:47,760
- It's private here, isn't it?
- Very private.

939
01:18:50,891 --> 01:18:53,369
I think I know why I came here.

940
01:18:56,891 --> 01:18:59,978
I think I came here to talk about myself.

941
01:19:00,108 --> 01:19:02,413
OK. Why don't we?

942
01:19:09,242 --> 01:19:10,458
Hi.

943
01:19:14,501 --> 01:19:16,589
Calvin?

944
01:19:18,895 --> 01:19:21,371
What's the matter?

945
01:19:26,809 --> 01:19:29,288
This'll sound strange.

946
01:19:31,289 --> 01:19:34,114
What I'm gonna say will sound strange.

947
01:19:34,245 --> 01:19:36,766
What happened? Come inside.

948
01:19:39,159 --> 01:19:42,855
- Could we talk about Buck's funeral?
- What?

949
01:19:42,985 --> 01:19:44,482
I know it'll seem trivial,

950
01:19:44,582 --> 01:19:47,562
but it's on my mind,
and I'd just like to talk about it.

951
01:19:48,464 --> 01:19:49,508
Why?

952
01:19:49,595 --> 01:19:53,030
When I was getting dressed
for Buck's funeral, I was...

953
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:57,160
- Calvin, what's the matter with you?
- Just let me get it off my chest.

954
01:19:57,291 --> 01:20:00,595
What could dressing for Buck's
funeral have to do with anything?

955
01:20:00,726 --> 01:20:03,422
I was wearing a blue shirt,

956
01:20:03,552 --> 01:20:06,901
and you said "Wear a white shirt
and the other shoes."

957
01:20:06,987 --> 01:20:11,815
It was nothing at the time.
But it's always seemed to stay with me.

958
01:20:12,075 --> 01:20:14,685
I've for some reason
been thinking about it,

959
01:20:14,815 --> 01:20:19,380
and it suddenly occurred to me - what
difference did it make what I wore?

960
01:20:19,989 --> 01:20:22,120
Hear me out. It won't hurt you to listen.

961
01:20:22,207 --> 01:20:24,730
No one in their right mind
would listen to that!

962
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:27,643
I just wanna talk about
something I remember.

963
01:20:27,773 --> 01:20:29,470
Why do you wanna remind me?

964
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,557
I've always wondered, in some needling
way, what it mattered what I wore.

965
01:20:36,557 --> 01:20:41,080
I was crazy that day.
We were going to our son's funeral.

966
01:20:43,906 --> 01:20:47,037
And you were worried about
what I wore on my feet.

967
01:20:48,645 --> 01:20:53,864
I'm sure it sounds like nothing to you,
but I just wanted to tell you about it.

968
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:09,867
It's all right.

969
01:21:22,259 --> 01:21:25,173
Beth, hi! How are you?

970
01:21:25,303 --> 01:21:27,739
- Carol! How are you?
- I haven't seen you.

971
01:21:27,869 --> 01:21:31,870
I've been so busy. I promise I'll call you
soon and we'll have lunch.

972
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,174
How's Brad? Give him my love.

973
01:21:34,304 --> 01:21:37,957
Isn't this madness?
It gets worse every year.

974
01:21:38,087 --> 01:21:40,175
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

975
01:21:47,523 --> 01:21:49,872
May I show you this in your size?

976
01:21:50,485 --> 01:21:51,485
What?

977
01:21:51,611 --> 01:21:54,307
May I show you this dress in your size?

978
01:21:55,133 --> 01:21:57,481
No. No, thank you.

979
01:22:03,266 --> 01:22:06,917
We've got the Bennetts' and the Grants'
and the Foleys'.

980
01:22:07,352 --> 01:22:11,006
Conrad should get something
for my mother and father.

981
01:22:11,744 --> 01:22:14,397
He's not meant to get something
for his doctor, is he?

982
01:22:14,527 --> 01:22:18,962
I don't think so. I think we should
go see him, Beth. Dr. Berger.

983
01:22:20,875 --> 01:22:23,834
- What?
- We could all go and see him together.

984
01:22:23,964 --> 01:22:26,529
- Why?
- He thinks it's a good idea.

985
01:22:26,616 --> 01:22:30,051
He thinks it's a good idea? What
does he know about me, this family?

986
01:22:30,181 --> 01:22:33,357
- I've never even met him.
- Exactly. That's the point.

987
01:22:33,487 --> 01:22:37,009
Wouldn't it be easier if we all
talked about it, in the open?

988
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:40,227
About what?
What are we gonna talk about?

989
01:22:40,357 --> 01:22:44,097
Don't try to change me, Calvin. I don't
want any more changes in my life.

990
01:22:44,227 --> 01:22:47,793
Hasn't enough happened?
Let's just hold on to what we've got.

991
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:52,053
Darling, that is what this is for.
Maybe you'll get a surprise.

992
01:22:52,184 --> 01:22:54,490
I don't want any surprises.

993
01:22:56,967 --> 01:23:02,359
I'm not perfect. If I can't hug everybody
all the time like you do, then I'm sorry.

994
01:23:02,490 --> 01:23:04,882
I'm not asking you to be perfect.

995
01:23:05,012 --> 01:23:08,057
I don't want to see
any doctors or counselors.

996
01:23:08,143 --> 01:23:10,533
I'm me. This is my family.

997
01:23:11,230 --> 01:23:14,709
If we have problems, we will solve them
in the privacy of our own home,

998
01:23:14,839 --> 01:23:18,014
not by running to some
specialist every time...

999
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:20,406
Are you folks ready to order?

1000
01:23:21,187 --> 01:23:23,492
Could you give me a couple of minutes?

1001
01:23:24,928 --> 01:23:28,711
..running to experts every time
something goes wrong.

1002
01:23:34,103 --> 01:23:36,190
I know you mean well.

1003
01:23:36,321 --> 01:23:39,931
- I want this to be a nice Christmas.
- I do too.

1004
01:23:40,757 --> 01:23:43,670
I want all of them
to be nice Christmases.

1005
01:23:43,757 --> 01:23:46,888
We need time together, Calvin.
You and I.

1006
01:23:46,974 --> 01:23:49,411
We have to get away. New Year's.

1007
01:23:50,454 --> 01:23:53,931
We can spend some time in Houston
with my brother and Audrey.

1008
01:23:54,019 --> 01:23:57,020
Play a little golf. Relax.

1009
01:23:58,410 --> 01:24:03,324
I've already talked to Mother about it
and Conrad can stay with them.

1010
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,499
Don't worry about him.

1011
01:24:05,629 --> 01:24:08,237
Please, for his sake, don't indulge him.

1012
01:24:09,543 --> 01:24:12,761
We need time together. OK?

1013
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:16,890
OK. OK.

1014
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:20,284
I love you.

1015
01:24:22,675 --> 01:24:25,764
I love you too.

1016
01:24:28,501 --> 01:24:30,981
Let's just give things time, OK?

1017
01:24:32,547 --> 01:24:34,242
OK.

1018
01:24:42,635 --> 01:24:44,678
Conrad?

1019
01:24:46,418 --> 01:24:50,114
I don't bowl. I mean,
I'm a horrible bowler.

1020
01:24:50,244 --> 01:24:52,941
- That's all right.
- Yeah, well...

1021
01:24:54,594 --> 01:24:56,681
I got it. That's OK.

1022
01:24:57,202 --> 01:25:00,201
Thing is, I'm a funny bowler.

1023
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:05,159
We don't have to go bowling.
I'm not a bowling nut or anything.

1024
01:25:05,247 --> 01:25:08,551
- How funny are you?
- On a scale from one to ten...

1025
01:25:09,595 --> 01:25:11,681
about a ten.

1026
01:25:11,811 --> 01:25:15,638
That's pretty funny.
Well, I promise you won't look silly.

1027
01:25:15,769 --> 01:25:18,118
- Guarantee it?
- Guarantee it.

1028
01:25:45,078 --> 01:25:48,514
- Can you ever break the ball?
- Can't break the ball,

1029
01:25:48,644 --> 01:25:52,253
can't break the floor, can't break
anything in a bowling alley.

1030
01:25:52,384 --> 01:25:57,384
And that is what I like about bowling
alleys. You can't even break the record.

1031
01:26:04,124 --> 01:26:06,689
- Anyway...
- What?

1032
01:26:07,515 --> 01:26:09,994
Just "anyway".
It's a conversation starter.

1033
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:11,472
- Catchy.
- You like it?

1034
01:26:11,559 --> 01:26:15,168
I thought it'd get to ya.
I've been workin' on it all day.

1035
01:26:16,821 --> 01:26:19,387
Do you think people are punished
for the things they do?

1036
01:26:19,517 --> 01:26:21,518
You mean by God?

1037
01:26:21,604 --> 01:26:24,562
- Yeah.
- I don't believe in God.

1038
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:26,301
- Not at all?
- No.

1039
01:26:26,432 --> 01:26:28,954
It's not a question of degree.
You do or you don't.

1040
01:26:29,085 --> 01:26:31,736
I believe in God.

1041
01:26:31,824 --> 01:26:35,346
So are you afraid he'll punish you
for something you did?

1042
01:26:35,477 --> 01:26:39,521
I've done a lot of things I'm ashamed of.

1043
01:26:41,389 --> 01:26:43,565
Yeah? So have I.

1044
01:26:52,088 --> 01:26:54,131
Did it hurt?

1045
01:26:59,348 --> 01:27:01,522
I don't remember really.

1046
01:27:01,653 --> 01:27:04,828
- You don't want to talk about it?
- I don't know.

1047
01:27:05,828 --> 01:27:08,655
I've never really talked about it.

1048
01:27:08,786 --> 01:27:13,567
To doctors, but not to anyone else.
You're the first person who's asked.

1049
01:27:13,655 --> 01:27:15,829
Why'd you do it?

1050
01:27:24,091 --> 01:27:28,267
I don't know. It was like...
falling into a hole.

1051
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:35,702
It was like falling into a hole and
it keeps getting bigger and bigger,

1052
01:27:35,832 --> 01:27:41,225
and you can't get out.
Then, all of a sudden, it's inside,

1053
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,442
and you're the hole,

1054
01:27:44,573 --> 01:27:47,921
and you're trapped and it's all over.
Something like that.

1055
01:27:48,312 --> 01:27:52,965
And it's not really scary,
except it is when you think back on it,

1056
01:27:53,095 --> 01:27:57,009
cos you know that what you were
feeling was strange and new...

1057
01:28:08,402 --> 01:28:09,576
.

1058
01:28:09,662 --> 01:28:11,359
- Hey, Jarrett.
- Come on!

1059
01:28:11,489 --> 01:28:14,272
Hey, Jarrett, how ya doing?
Hey, Jeannine.

1060
01:28:14,620 --> 01:28:16,706
What are you doing?

1061
01:28:16,794 --> 01:28:18,708
No.

1062
01:28:19,577 --> 01:28:22,055
What's your problem? Lighten up!

1063
01:28:50,189 --> 01:28:52,451
Energetic, those guys.

1064
01:28:53,365 --> 01:28:56,844
- Yeah, they were pretty funny.
- No.

1065
01:28:56,974 --> 01:28:59,756
- What? You thought they were funny.
- No...

1066
01:29:10,062 --> 01:29:12,541
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

1067
01:29:16,412 --> 01:29:18,672
Anyway.

1068
01:29:33,849 --> 01:29:36,327
- Do you wanna talk?
- About what?

1069
01:29:39,849 --> 01:29:42,415
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1070
01:29:42,545 --> 01:29:44,632
Yeah, I'm fine.

1071
01:29:46,589 --> 01:29:48,937
- I'll give you a call.
- Will you?

1072
01:29:50,024 --> 01:29:52,721
- I want you to.
- Sure.

1073
01:30:01,853 --> 01:30:03,721
Well...

1074
01:30:05,069 --> 01:30:07,114
Guess I'll see you in choir.

1075
01:30:07,244 --> 01:30:09,506
OK, yeah. Thanks.

1076
01:30:10,723 --> 01:30:12,637
OK.

1077
01:30:12,723 --> 01:30:14,810
I mean, good night.

1078
01:30:15,636 --> 01:30:17,680
Good night.

1079
01:30:28,857 --> 01:30:32,509
- Seven.
- Yes... It's not even plugged in.

1080
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:36,770
<i>In preparation for landing, please
observe the "fasten seat belt" sign.</i>

1081
01:30:36,900 --> 01:30:41,250
<i>And, please, no smoking until
well inside the terminal. Thank you.</i>

1082
01:30:49,294 --> 01:30:52,381
All right. Watch this. Pessimistic golfer.

1083
01:30:53,164 --> 01:30:55,251
Pessimistic golfer.

1084
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:58,122
Oh, damn!

1085
01:30:59,686 --> 01:31:01,860
- Are we mo up? Two?
- Two.

1086
01:31:01,991 --> 01:31:04,165
Let's hustle up. We're up close here.

1087
01:31:04,296 --> 01:31:06,643
I'll never get over how flat it is here.

1088
01:31:06,731 --> 01:31:10,078
I know it's flat,
but we're gonna teach you to love it.

1089
01:31:10,209 --> 01:31:12,993
He's trying to get everybody
to move down here.

1090
01:31:13,123 --> 01:31:16,340
Gosh, you guys,
it is so good to see you.

1091
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:19,558
- You look tired, Cal.
- Airplane Scotch.

1092
01:31:19,864 --> 01:31:21,993
Would you tell me why I'm still hungry?

1093
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,167
Cos you're in Texas, girl.

1094
01:31:24,341 --> 01:31:28,474
When we get done, we'll get ya home,
get ya some steaks on the barbecue.

1095
01:31:28,604 --> 01:31:32,865
- Audrey will make her famous salad.
- And a baked potato and sour cream?

1096
01:31:32,995 --> 01:31:36,344
- How long has he had that drawl?
- Since we joined the country club.

1097
01:32:22,567 --> 01:32:25,916
I'm glad you can laugh about it,
cos it sure as hell wasn't funny.

1098
01:32:26,047 --> 01:32:29,742
- We weren't that bad.
- Let's face it, we stunk.

1099
01:32:29,872 --> 01:32:33,178
How can you listen to that lecture
about Buck Jarrett again?

1100
01:32:33,265 --> 01:32:36,873
I know he was the world's greatest
swimmer, but it bugs the hell outta me.

1101
01:32:37,004 --> 01:32:38,525
Stillman, cut it.

1102
01:32:38,657 --> 01:32:43,092
- Will he ever stop kissin' his picture?
- Stillman, shut the hell up.

1103
01:32:43,962 --> 01:32:46,789
- Con, you want a ride?
- No, thanks.

1104
01:32:46,919 --> 01:32:50,310
- Sure could've used you today, buddy.
- No, I don't think so.

1105
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:53,397
Yeah - I don't think anybody
could've helped us today.

1106
01:32:53,529 --> 01:32:58,137
How's it goin', Jarrett? Hear you got
eyes for Pratt. You in her pants yet?

1107
01:32:58,268 --> 01:33:00,703
Stillman, try not to be such a prick.

1108
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:04,834
You're the prick. Guys like you
walk around like you're king shit,

1109
01:33:04,921 --> 01:33:08,182
you give me a goddamn pain in the ass.
You think we owe you...

1110
01:33:12,791 --> 01:33:14,835
Come on!

1111
01:33:18,662 --> 01:33:21,531
- Come on! Connie!
- Cool it, Jarrett.

1112
01:33:21,661 --> 01:33:24,140
No, Stillman! No!

1113
01:33:24,228 --> 01:33:26,316
Let go.

1114
01:33:27,532 --> 01:33:30,577
It's all right. Just calm down, huh?

1115
01:33:31,229 --> 01:33:34,360
You're crazy.
You're crazy, you know that?

1116
01:33:37,708 --> 01:33:41,925
- Send him back where he came from!
- Enough. It's over.

1117
01:33:42,665 --> 01:33:45,101
All right. Shit!

1118
01:33:58,145 --> 01:34:00,232
Here's your hat.

1119
01:34:08,712 --> 01:34:11,017
You wanna talk?

1120
01:34:11,626 --> 01:34:14,973
The guy's a nothing.
He's a zero upstairs.

1121
01:34:16,104 --> 01:34:20,041
You know that, Con. Ever since
fourth grade, you've known it.

1122
01:34:20,191 --> 01:34:23,366
So you make yourself look stupid
when you let him get to you.

1123
01:34:23,497 --> 01:34:26,542
- So I look stupid? Is that it?
- No, it isn't.

1124
01:34:26,672 --> 01:34:30,976
What is it with you? I don't know
why you wanna be in this alone.

1125
01:34:34,369 --> 01:34:37,282
You know, I miss him too.

1126
01:34:39,673 --> 01:34:43,370
Connie, the three of us
were best friends.

1127
01:34:44,675 --> 01:34:47,630
I can't help it. It hurts too much
to be around you.

1128
01:34:51,153 --> 01:34:53,892
I gotta go.

1129
01:34:56,415 --> 01:34:58,501
Yeah, OK.

1130
01:36:18,469 --> 01:36:21,643
<i>- Hello?
- Hello. Is Karen there?</i>

1131
01:36:21,773 --> 01:36:23,862
<i>She...</i>

1132
01:36:26,687 --> 01:36:27,732
<i>.</i>

1133
01:36:27,818 --> 01:36:31,689
Is Karen there? This is Conrad Jarrett.
I'm a friend of hers.

1134
01:36:33,690 --> 01:36:37,689
<i>- Karen's dead.
- What? What?</i>

1135
01:36:37,777 --> 01:36:40,124
She killed herself.

1136
01:36:47,951 --> 01:36:50,822
<i>Let's have the best Christmas ever.</i>

1137
01:36:52,039 --> 01:36:54,387
We can, you know.

1138
01:36:54,517 --> 01:36:57,692
<i>We could have the best year
of our whole lives.</i>

1139
01:37:03,693 --> 01:37:06,346
- Get the sail down!
- I can't hold it!

1140
01:37:06,476 --> 01:37:08,562
Keep it starboard!

1141
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:12,955
- Get the sail down!
- Keep it starboard.

1142
01:37:15,956 --> 01:37:18,000
- Go for it.
- I'm trying!

1143
01:37:18,130 --> 01:37:20,390
I can't! Let it out!

1144
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:25,216
- Let it out!
- Just keep it starboard.

1145
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:37,872
- Bucky!
- Give me your hand!

1146
01:37:38,003 --> 01:37:40,351
Here!

1147
01:37:42,177 --> 01:37:45,959
We screwed up this time, buddy.
Dad's gonna haul ass over this.

1148
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:48,786
It ain't so goddamned funny!

1149
01:37:52,395 --> 01:37:55,439
- Just don't let go.
- I won't. Honest to God.

1150
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:57,613
Everything's gonna be OK.

1151
01:38:00,744 --> 01:38:03,049
Hang on, brother.

1152
01:38:04,527 --> 01:38:07,049
Stay with me!

1153
01:38:08,007 --> 01:38:09,963
Stay with me!

1154
01:38:10,094 --> 01:38:12,050
Bucky! Where are you?

1155
01:38:14,006 --> 01:38:16,746
Bucky!

1156
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:19,963
Bucky!

1157
01:38:21,269 --> 01:38:22,443
Buck!

1158
01:38:24,139 --> 01:38:25,573
Buck!

1159
01:38:30,444 --> 01:38:32,880
<i>- Hello?
- This is Conrad.</i>

1160
01:38:33,011 --> 01:38:35,618
<i>- What's going on?
- I need to see you.</i>

1161
01:38:35,706 --> 01:38:37,358
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

1162
01:38:37,488 --> 01:38:40,533
<i>- Where are you?
- I don't know.</i>

1163
01:38:40,664 --> 01:38:46,012
<i>All right. Listen to me. Get to the office
somehow and I'll meet you there.</i>

1164
01:38:50,143 --> 01:38:51,969
Good. You're here.

1165
01:38:52,056 --> 01:38:54,578
- Something happened.
- Just hold on.

1166
01:38:54,708 --> 01:38:58,360
- I need...
- Just let me get inside.

1167
01:39:00,230 --> 01:39:02,317
There.

1168
01:39:02,970 --> 01:39:08,144
Shit. You'd think they would assume
there'd be an emergency now and then.

1169
01:39:08,231 --> 01:39:10,580
No. Don't take it off. Just sit down.

1170
01:39:14,971 --> 01:39:16,928
- Something happened.
- What?

1171
01:39:17,058 --> 01:39:19,363
- It's.
- It's what?

1172
01:39:19,449 --> 01:39:21,537
Oh, God!

1173
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:26,278
- I need something.
- What do you need? Tell me.

1174
01:39:26,408 --> 01:39:29,322
It just keeps coming!
I can't make it stop!

1175
01:39:29,452 --> 01:39:30,887
Don't try.

1176
01:39:31,018 --> 01:39:33,757
I gotta get off the hook for it.

1177
01:39:33,844 --> 01:39:35,322
- for what?
- for what I did.

1178
01:39:35,454 --> 01:39:37,585
- What did you do?
- for what I did to him.

1179
01:39:37,715 --> 01:39:39,584
- What did you do?
- It's something.

1180
01:39:39,714 --> 01:39:43,671
Don't you see? It's gotta be somebody's
fault, or there's no goddamn point!

1181
01:39:43,801 --> 01:39:46,802
- Point? What point? It happened!
- No. It ain't it.

1182
01:39:46,933 --> 01:39:50,586
No, I don't mean that. It's that...

1183
01:39:50,716 --> 01:39:53,542
Buck! Bucky, I didn't mean it!

1184
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:58,412
- Bucky, I didn't mean it! Bucky!
- I know that. It wasn't your fault.

1185
01:39:58,543 --> 01:40:01,195
It was! You said get the sail down,
and I couldn't!

1186
01:40:01,283 --> 01:40:04,934
I couldn't! It jammed!
The halyard jammed.

1187
01:40:05,064 --> 01:40:08,110
I couldn't because
the goddamn halyard jammed!

1188
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:12,240
And you're screwing around
until it's too late to do anything!

1189
01:40:12,371 --> 01:40:15,154
And I'm supposed to take care of it!

1190
01:40:15,284 --> 01:40:17,588
- And that wasn't fair, was it?
- No!

1191
01:40:17,675 --> 01:40:20,242
And then you say "Hang on!"

1192
01:40:20,372 --> 01:40:22,329
And then you let go!

1193
01:40:22,720 --> 01:40:25,241
- Why'd you let go?
- Because I got tired.

1194
01:40:25,371 --> 01:40:28,069
Yeah? Well, screw you, you jerk!

1195
01:40:40,810 --> 01:40:43,811
It hurts to be mad at him, doesn't it?

1196
01:40:43,942 --> 01:40:45,985
Yeah.

1197
01:40:47,414 --> 01:40:53,289
He just wasn't careful. He didn't see
how a bad thing might happen.

1198
01:40:54,073 --> 01:40:57,203
Bad things happen even when
people are careful.

1199
01:40:57,290 --> 01:41:02,161
We were screwin' around. We shoulda
come in when it started to look bad.

1200
01:41:02,465 --> 01:41:04,595
OK. So you made a mistake.

1201
01:41:05,292 --> 01:41:08,378
Why did he let go? Why?

1202
01:41:09,596 --> 01:41:11,684
Maybe you were stronger.

1203
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:16,379
Did it ever occur to you
that you might have been stronger?

1204
01:41:23,250 --> 01:41:27,121
How long are you gonna punish
yourself? When are you gonna quit?

1205
01:41:27,773 --> 01:41:30,859
- Oh, God, I'd like to quit.
- Why don't you?

1206
01:41:30,948 --> 01:41:33,165
It's not that easy.

1207
01:41:39,558 --> 01:41:42,601
God... I loved him.

1208
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:50,168
I know.

1209
01:42:03,212 --> 01:42:06,995
You said something happened.
What started all this?

1210
01:42:07,126 --> 01:42:09,213
Karen...

1211
01:42:10,388 --> 01:42:15,735
She killed herself.
I just found out she's dead.

1212
01:42:16,128 --> 01:42:17,778
Jesus.

1213
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:20,171
And she was fine. She was OK.

1214
01:42:20,519 --> 01:42:22,824
No. She wasn't.

1215
01:42:22,911 --> 01:42:24,867
She was!

1216
01:42:24,954 --> 01:42:27,650
- She told me. She said she was...
- What?

1217
01:42:27,781 --> 01:42:29,999
She was busy, she was
feeling good and...

1218
01:42:30,086 --> 01:42:32,173
And what?

1219
01:42:32,869 --> 01:42:34,043
What?

1220
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:37,086
I just wish I'd known.
I could've done something.

1221
01:42:37,435 --> 01:42:39,913
You saw her once,
and you wanna take her on too?

1222
01:42:39,999 --> 01:42:41,740
- No!
- No?

1223
01:42:41,870 --> 01:42:43,914
- No, I just...
- What?

1224
01:42:44,219 --> 01:42:49,175
That isn't it. I feel really bad about this.

1225
01:42:49,262 --> 01:42:52,654
Just let me feel bad about this.

1226
01:42:54,219 --> 01:42:56,263
OK.

1227
01:42:58,133 --> 01:43:00,481
Listen, I feel bad about it too.

1228
01:43:05,525 --> 01:43:09,656
Why do things have to happen
to people? It isn't fair.

1229
01:43:10,178 --> 01:43:12,395
You're right. It isn't fair.

1230
01:43:13,005 --> 01:43:15,700
You just do one wrong thing and...

1231
01:43:20,222 --> 01:43:23,223
And what was the one
wrong thing you did?

1232
01:43:31,006 --> 01:43:33,094
You know.

1233
01:43:45,009 --> 01:43:46,314
You know.

1234
01:43:50,663 --> 01:43:54,270
I hung on. I stayed with the boat.

1235
01:43:54,879 --> 01:43:56,967
Exactly.

1236
01:44:03,663 --> 01:44:06,185
Now, you can live with that, can't you?

1237
01:44:12,796 --> 01:44:16,579
I'm scared! I'm scared...

1238
01:44:17,273 --> 01:44:19,752
feelings are scary.

1239
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:22,101
And sometimes they're painful.

1240
01:44:22,970 --> 01:44:27,231
And if you can't feel pain, then you're
not gonna feel anything else either.

1241
01:44:27,363 --> 01:44:29,450
You know what I'm saying?

1242
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,408
I think so.

1243
01:44:36,407 --> 01:44:40,669
You're here and you're alive.
And don't tell me you don't feel that.

1244
01:44:40,799 --> 01:44:43,148
It doesn't feel good.

1245
01:44:43,496 --> 01:44:45,800
It is good. Believe me.

1246
01:44:50,670 --> 01:44:52,757
How do you know?

1247
01:44:55,367 --> 01:44:57,758
Because I'm your friend.

1248
01:45:01,933 --> 01:45:05,586
I don't know what I would've done
if you hadn't been here.

1249
01:45:12,064 --> 01:45:14,499
Are you really my friend?

1250
01:45:15,891 --> 01:45:18,282
I am. Count on it.

1251
01:46:10,942 --> 01:46:14,942
Hi. I was gonna call,
but I didn't wanna wake anyone.

1252
01:46:16,725 --> 01:46:19,856
- It might've been easier.
- About the other night.

1253
01:46:19,943 --> 01:46:23,335
I mean, I liked being with you.
I didn't like myself...

1254
01:46:23,465 --> 01:46:26,204
Conrad, I was stupid.

1255
01:46:26,291 --> 01:46:29,380
That was dumb of me to laugh
and it was my fault.

1256
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:33,294
I just didn't know what to do.
I was embarrassed.

1257
01:46:33,381 --> 01:46:35,554
Really? You were embarrassed?

1258
01:46:35,815 --> 01:46:40,338
Yes. When those boys came in,
it was awful and awkward.

1259
01:46:40,425 --> 01:46:42,991
That's what I do when I get
embarrassed. I laugh.

1260
01:46:43,121 --> 01:46:46,468
But they were all right. They were
just up and havin' a good time,

1261
01:46:46,555 --> 01:46:49,817
and I let them get in the way
of what was happening.

1262
01:46:49,947 --> 01:46:54,645
It was dumb. I've been doing
a lot of dumb things lately.

1263
01:46:54,731 --> 01:46:59,078
I just didn't know whether or not
you were being straight with me.

1264
01:47:03,471 --> 01:47:05,515
Yeah?

1265
01:47:06,515 --> 01:47:11,863
I'd like to try it again. I thought it worked
out OK. Well, except for the bowling.

1266
01:47:12,820 --> 01:47:15,342
- Yes.
- Yes?

1267
01:47:17,081 --> 01:47:19,560
Yes.

1268
01:47:20,386 --> 01:47:22,560
Are you going to school?

1269
01:47:23,038 --> 01:47:24,995
No, not on Sunday.

1270
01:47:28,736 --> 01:47:31,911
- Have you eaten?
- No, I haven't.

1271
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:34,084
Do you want some breakfast?

1272
01:47:51,912 --> 01:47:52,999
Mom!

1273
01:47:55,348 --> 01:47:58,652
- All right! How about that?
- Oh, boy.

1274
01:47:58,739 --> 01:48:03,088
- Oh, I do love that.
- These holes sure do love you.

1275
01:48:05,653 --> 01:48:08,645
We should spend more time
playing golf together, you know that?

1276
01:48:08,732 --> 01:48:11,218
Maybe our next vacation, strictly golf.

1277
01:48:11,348 --> 01:48:12,847
Pinehurst, Myrtle Beach...

1278
01:48:13,528 --> 01:48:17,571
Pinehurst would be nice. I think
Connie would like Pinehurst.

1279
01:48:18,524 --> 01:48:21,785
Do you do that deliberately
or is it just a reflex?

1280
01:48:21,917 --> 01:48:24,307
You said vacation.
I assumed you meant him too.

1281
01:48:24,394 --> 01:48:27,264
I'm surprised you haven't called him.

1282
01:48:27,351 --> 01:48:29,570
I was gonna call him tonight.

1283
01:48:29,701 --> 01:48:32,006
Can we have a little drink
before we head back?

1284
01:48:32,136 --> 01:48:34,353
Drink, yes. Little, no.

1285
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:36,441
- Let's finish this.
- finish what?

1286
01:48:36,527 --> 01:48:38,354
- What you started.
- What I started?

1287
01:48:38,442 --> 01:48:41,136
- What you started.
- There's no point discussing it.

1288
01:48:41,268 --> 01:48:43,224
He controls you from 2,000 miles away.

1289
01:48:43,355 --> 01:48:45,180
- He isn't the problem.
- Isn't he?

1290
01:48:45,310 --> 01:48:48,355
No. Let's talk about
what's really bothering you.

1291
01:48:48,485 --> 01:48:52,095
No, let's talk about what's bothering
you. That's what you want.

1292
01:48:52,225 --> 01:48:54,530
What have I done to make you
so angry with me?

1293
01:48:54,661 --> 01:48:58,095
It's not that, it's what you think
I've done. You blame me.

1294
01:48:58,225 --> 01:49:01,052
Can't you see anything except
in terms of how it affects you?

1295
01:49:01,182 --> 01:49:06,706
No! And neither can you or anybody
else. Only I'm more honest about it.

1296
01:49:06,835 --> 01:49:11,662
Well, stop being so honest and start
being a little generous. Think about him.

1297
01:49:11,792 --> 01:49:15,575
- I don't know what he expects from me.
- I'll tell you.

1298
01:49:15,707 --> 01:49:20,141
What? He wants me to throw my arms
around him? Well, I can't.

1299
01:49:20,228 --> 01:49:25,316
I cannot respond when someone says
"I just did this great thing. Love me."

1300
01:49:25,403 --> 01:49:29,709
All he wants is to know
that you don't hate him. That's it.

1301
01:49:29,839 --> 01:49:32,622
Hate him? My God!
How could I hate him?

1302
01:49:32,752 --> 01:49:36,362
Mothers don't hate their sons.
Is that what he told you?

1303
01:49:36,450 --> 01:49:40,362
Do you see how you accept what he
says and you can't do the same for me?

1304
01:49:40,492 --> 01:49:44,450
- I'm trying to keep this family together.
- I don't know what people want of me!

1305
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:47,625
Beth, nobody wants
anything from you.

1306
01:49:47,712 --> 01:49:51,537
We all just want... Cal, Con, everybody,
we just want you to be happy.

1307
01:49:51,667 --> 01:49:53,146
- Happy?
- Yes.

1308
01:49:53,277 --> 01:49:56,146
Ward, tell me the definition of happy.

1309
01:49:56,278 --> 01:49:59,017
But first make sure
that your kids are safe,

1310
01:49:59,148 --> 01:50:03,061
that no one's fallen off a horse,
or been hit by a car,

1311
01:50:03,147 --> 01:50:06,192
or drowned in that swimming pool
you're so proud of.

1312
01:50:06,322 --> 01:50:10,018
Then you come to me and tell me
how to be happy.

1313
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:05,896
I think I'm gonna turn in.

1314
01:51:06,548 --> 01:51:08,852
Dinner was good. Really good.

1315
01:51:09,678 --> 01:51:14,157
- It's pretty early. You tired?
- Yeah. It was kind of a rough week.

1316
01:51:14,245 --> 01:51:17,202
I hope your grandmother
wasn't too tough on you.

1317
01:51:17,289 --> 01:51:19,809
No. She was fine.

1318
01:51:22,549 --> 01:51:25,246
I'm glad you're back.

1319
01:51:39,249 --> 01:51:41,336
Good night.

1320
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:13,000
Calvin?

1321
01:53:23,784 --> 01:53:26,480
Why are you crying?

1322
01:53:32,654 --> 01:53:36,221
Can I... can I get you something?

1323
01:53:38,744 --> 01:53:41,308
- I don't...
- What did you say?

1324
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:48,614
Calvin, what did you say?

1325
01:53:54,180 --> 01:53:56,267
Tell me.

1326
01:54:02,267 --> 01:54:04,571
You are beautiful.

1327
01:54:07,138 --> 01:54:09,400
And you are unpredictable.

1328
01:54:11,573 --> 01:54:13,877
But you're so cautious.

1329
01:54:16,356 --> 01:54:18,574
You're determined, Beth.

1330
01:54:18,661 --> 01:54:20,966
But you know something?

1331
01:54:22,097 --> 01:54:24,400
You're not strong.

1332
01:54:26,661 --> 01:54:29,185
And I don't know if you're really giving.

1333
01:54:32,664 --> 01:54:35,576
Tell me something. Do you love me?

1334
01:54:38,317 --> 01:54:40,622
Do you really love me?

1335
01:54:43,318 --> 01:54:46,839
I feel the way I've always felt about you.

1336
01:54:59,449 --> 01:55:04,537
We would have been all right
if there hadn't been any... mess.

1337
01:55:07,320 --> 01:55:09,580
But you can't handle mess.

1338
01:55:11,277 --> 01:55:14,582
You need everything neat and easy.

1339
01:55:15,931 --> 01:55:20,060
I don't know.
Maybe you can't love anybody.

1340
01:55:20,538 --> 01:55:23,017
It was so much Buck.

1341
01:55:23,147 --> 01:55:26,236
When Buck died, it was as if
you buried all your love with him,

1342
01:55:26,366 --> 01:55:29,541
and I don't understand that.
I just don't know...

1343
01:55:32,063 --> 01:55:36,369
Maybe it wasn't even Buck.
Maybe it was just you.

1344
01:55:37,933 --> 01:55:41,977
Maybe, finally, it was the best of you
that you buried.

1345
01:55:45,238 --> 01:55:47,543
But whatever it was...

1346
01:55:51,021 --> 01:55:53,282
I don't know who you are.

1347
01:55:55,022 --> 01:55:57,762
And I don't know what
we've been playing at.

1348
01:56:01,240 --> 01:56:03,936
So I was crying.

1349
01:56:08,111 --> 01:56:11,632
Because I don't know
if I love you any more.

1350
01:56:15,895 --> 01:56:19,199
And I don't know what
I'm going to do without that.

1351
01:58:50,612 --> 01:58:52,699
Dad?

1352
01:58:55,003 --> 01:58:57,743
The yard looks smaller without leaves.

1353
01:58:59,047 --> 01:59:01,135
Dad? What happened?

1354
01:59:02,744 --> 01:59:05,440
Your mother's going away for a while.

1355
01:59:06,091 --> 01:59:08,396
Where? Why?

1356
01:59:09,396 --> 01:59:12,746
Back to Houston. Then, I don't know.

1357
01:59:14,136 --> 01:59:16,223
Why? What...

1358
01:59:18,833 --> 01:59:21,529
- I know why. It's me, isn't it?
- No.

1359
01:59:21,659 --> 01:59:25,920
- Yeah, it is. It's my fault.
- Don't do that! Don't do that to yourself!

1360
01:59:26,008 --> 01:59:30,923
It's nobody's fault. Things happen.
People don't always have the answers.

1361
01:59:35,444 --> 01:59:37,794
I don't know why I'm yelling at you.

1362
01:59:37,924 --> 01:59:41,400
No, you're right.
You oughta do that more often.

1363
01:59:41,489 --> 01:59:45,098
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Haul my ass, get after me.

1364
01:59:47,359 --> 01:59:49,881
The way you used to for him.

1365
01:59:50,011 --> 01:59:52,533
He needed it. You didn't.

1366
01:59:53,620 --> 01:59:56,925
You were always so hard on yourself,
I never had the heart.

1367
01:59:57,056 --> 01:59:59,361
Dad, don't.

1368
02:00:00,403 --> 02:00:02,447
No, it's the truth.

1369
02:00:03,665 --> 02:00:06,100
I never worried about you.

1370
02:00:07,883 --> 02:00:09,971
I just wasn't listening.

1371
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:14,623
I wasn't putting out signals. I don't
think you could have done anything.

1372
02:00:14,753 --> 02:00:18,320
No, I should've
got a handle on it somehow.

1373
02:00:23,363 --> 02:00:27,842
You know, I used to figure you had a
handle for everything. You knew it all.

1374
02:00:28,972 --> 02:00:34,583
It wasn't fair, but you always made us
feel everything would be all right.

1375
02:00:34,713 --> 02:00:39,236
I thought about that a lot lately.
I really admire you for it.

1376
02:00:39,888 --> 02:00:43,018
Well, don't admire people too much.

1377
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:45,540
They'll disappoint you sometimes.

1378
02:00:46,845 --> 02:00:49,150
I'm not disappointed.

1379
02:00:51,803 --> 02:00:54,108
I love you.

1380
02:00:59,934 --> 02:01:01,457
I love you too.
