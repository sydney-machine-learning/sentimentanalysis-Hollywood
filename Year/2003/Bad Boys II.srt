1
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,872
Ja, all this is under control.

2
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:45,062
A hundred and fifty million dollars,
and my dope is on the way.

3
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:47,690
Today is gonna be a good day.

4
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,236
We are 25 degrees north,
84 degrees west.

5
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:54,989
The cargo's being dropped.

6
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,940
Good.

7
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,983
- Do you wanna see his gun?
- Yeah.

8
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,364
Bang. Bang.

9
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,159
Sorry, Johnny.

10
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:41,828
Fucking bitches.

11
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,959
Infrared's got a live one on the water.

12
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,211
Air Force Stallion C-14 to Coast Guard.

13
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,841
We've got a fast-moving contact
heading 3-5-0 toward South Florida.

14
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:58,052
Captain, Air Force Stallion has a
contact at 1-8-0 closing fast.

15
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,472
This is Coast Guard cutter Valiant.
Request to know your intentions.

16
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,517
Vessel off our port bow,
this is U.S. Coast Guard.

17
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,520
Intercept is 1-8-0, speed 17 knots.

18
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,397
Make it so, chief. Scramble the helo.

19
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:16,195
Vessel off our port bow.
Vessel off our port bow.

20
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,488
This is U.S. Coast Guard.

21
00:03:17,698 --> 00:03:20,074
Request to know your intentions
at this time.

22
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,913
Incoming.

23
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,051
Valiant, Valiant, Valiant.

24
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,137
This is Coast Guard 6-0-0-3.

25
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,598
Negative contact with target. Over.

26
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:45,391
Captain, we've lost target.

27
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,781
Here's your delivery and payment.

28
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:04,994
Is it done?

29
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,122
- Cargo is on Dixie 7.
- Okay.

30
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:21,010
All right, TNT, for the millionth time,
listen up.

31
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:25,431
Since 9-11, we've gone hi-tech over
water. Dope runners have gone low.

32
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,601
Our source says the biggest X
shipment on record arrives tonight...

33
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,478
and we wanna know who's behind it.

34
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,397
Hopefully, in a few hours,
we'll have our answer.

35
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,316
We'll hit from three directions:

36
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:40,112
We'll go in with a water team, vehicle
assault and we got guys on foot.

37
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:45,159
We cannot make a move until our UCs
have ID'd the drugs and called us in.

38
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:48,955
No call, we back away.
And these guys we're going after...

39
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:53,668
they got a lot of firepower and they
hate the law. So eyes open out there.

40
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,343
Bravo's on the move.

41
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,865
Heads up. Here comes the drop.

42
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:34,834
Fuck. My lens is flaring.

43
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,711
I can't see shit.

44
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,715
Brothers! Gather around!

45
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,552
Hey.

46
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:48,139
- Why didn't you say there was a rally?
- Who's looking?

47
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,058
- Take that shit. I'm out of here.
- Shit.

48
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,354
- White power!
- White power!

49
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,982
- White power!
- White power!

50
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:05,197
Blue power, motherfuckers. Miami PD.

51
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,867
Aw, damn. It's the nigras.

52
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:11,078
Casper, drop the bag.
Alpha leader, bring them in.

53
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:14,290
Bad boys, bad boys What you gonna do?

54
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,460
What you gonna do When we come for you?

55
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,675
- Dude, you gotta learn the words.
- We usually only do the chorus.

56
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,635
Alpha leader, hit it. Br

57
00:06:26,845 --> 00:06:28,220
Repeat your transmission.

58
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,266
Alpha leader to Bravo Four,
please continue relay.

59
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,435
Where's backup?

60
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:37,897
- Alpha leader, bring them in. Hit it.
- Mike, I'm only getting static.

61
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,940
It's all static. The radios are fucked.

62
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:44,612
- Something funny? Something funny?
- Mike, where are they?

63
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,243
Got you, nigger.

64
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,041
- Looks like we got us a situation here.
- You won't shoot.

65
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,920
You got a gun to his head, so you
think I won't splatter you all over?

66
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,129
That's what I think.

67
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,174
My partner came here tonight
prepared to die.

68
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,467
Hell Hell, no!

69
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,261
Incinerating trash like you.
Ready to die, right, Marcus?

70
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,181
- The fuck I wanna do that for?
- Scared, ain't you, boy?

71
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,892
A: Put the gun down, tell me
who brings this shit in...

72
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,186
and maybe I'll just
pop one in your shoulder.

73
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,022
Or B: Keep acting all Brody,
and I'll put one in your chest.

74
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:23,025
Or C: You know, take the time
to talk a minute.

75
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,653
You know, de-escalate the situation.

76
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,197
See, that's my partner's
new spiritual bullshit.

77
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,075
Me? I actually prefer shooting
motherfuckers.

78
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,119
A lot of movement going on.

79
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,495
Can't see the UCs.

80
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,081
- I think something's going down.
- Don't move yet.

81
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,542
Mike, the man has a gun to my head.

82
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,169
He'll put it down if a hollow point's
in his eye!

83
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,213
Your partner's a cocky nigger.

84
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,508
- Damn. Now, was that necessary, sir?
- See?

85
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,010
He can't just be a cop?
He got to be a nigga too?

86
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,262
I'll hot this fool.

87
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,681
- Calm down.
- Calm down? I'm calm.

88
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,100
I'm calm! Hey!

89
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,520
I am way too unstable for that bullshit.

90
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,357
Stop all the goddamned movement!
Everybody stop moving!

91
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,569
We can't let you all go, but this
shit will get worked out in court.

92
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,654
We got our rights.

93
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,073
Exercise your right to shut the fuck up.

94
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:16,579
I'm all right. I'll give you a warning.
It's the best I can do for all of youse!

95
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,455
Okay? He's crazy.

96
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:22,543
- You got three seconds to drop your gun.
- He has anger issue problems!

97
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,879
- One.
- He goes to bed early for this shit!

98
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:27,631
Just to wake up to pop one
in a motherfucker!

99
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:29,550
- Two!
- Mike, no!

100
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,801
Gun!

101
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,347
Rock 'n' roll! Let's go!

102
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,932
Kill them cops!

103
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:10,257
Marcus!

104
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:47,920
Go! Go! Go! Come on, go!

105
00:09:53,969 --> 00:09:55,344
- Get down!
- Drop the!

106
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,931
- I didn't do shit!
- Get your hands up.

107
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,140
I didn't do it!

108
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,769
The radios were fucked up. Get some
medics over here. You guys okay?

109
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,313
- Yeah, we're fine.
- What you mean, "we"?

110
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,191
Motherfucker shot me in the ass, man.

111
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,195
- Who shot you in the ass?
- Who? That "who" would be you.

112
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,406
- Me? I shot you?
- Yeah.

113
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,993
I mean, I was shooting.
Yeah, I did a lot of shooting.

114
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:21,662
But I ain't saying I shot you
in the ass.

115
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,456
I ain't saying I didn't shoot you...

116
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:28,419
but, damn! Somebody shot you in the ass.

117
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,670
Tell me about it.

118
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:32,006
- Yo, man, how's it feel?
- It's hot, man.

119
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,008
I can smell my ass burning.

120
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:37,303
Mike, you should give it a little kiss
so it'll feel better.

121
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,305
Pretend like we're not even here.

122
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:42,349
Hey, isn't Ricky Martin having
a concert? Get the fuck on.

123
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,394
- You always gotta go racial, man.
- It's sad, man.

124
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:50,441
I think it's cool. It hit the meat.
It ain't nowhere near the hole.

125
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,278
Two lousy bags?

126
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:58,157
What about the biggest shipment
of ecstasy to come out of Amsterdam?

127
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,075
Let me worry about my snitch, all right?

128
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,328
It's a lot of cop work for nothing!

129
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,413
Take your ass home somewhere.

130
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,882
Tonight la policia jacked my mules.

131
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:19,887
Who can tell me how those jackals
knew where to bite Johnny Tapia?

132
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,514
Speak up, cousins.

133
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,768
You're lucky they did not find
my drugs on Dixie 7.

134
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,728
Change the boat schedule.

135
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,314
We can't. We got a shipment Thursday.

136
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,734
Change it after.
Just keep them guessing.

137
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:40,157
You know, unlike you, my daddy
didn't leave me no trust fund.

138
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,743
I got real-world shit
to deal with, Mike.

139
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,287
I'm not in it for the thrills.

140
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,498
Same old shit, different day.

141
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,293
All right, yes, damn.
I shot you, all right?

142
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,463
But you'd be seeing nothing at all
if I hadn't made my move.

143
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,256
I don't know why you acting so angry.

144
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,760
- You're misinformed. I'm not angry.
- No, you're very angry.

145
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,804
No, I'm not angry.

146
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,599
You are angry. It's okay.

147
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:10,229
I'm not angry. Except when
you keep repeating "you're angry."

148
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,356
That shit's fucking annoying.

149
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,442
Like a fucking gnat at a barbecue.

150
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:17,945
Just bugging the fuck out of me.

151
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,072
Good. I want you to say:

152
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:24,618
"I'm angry. It's okay.
I'll process my anger.

153
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,537
I love myself."

154
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,915
I don't know what the fuck you mean.

155
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,501
Yes, you do know what the fuck I mean.

156
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,253
You're the one that needs therapy.

157
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,712
- I did my therapy.
- When?

158
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,174
Captain Howard made me do it after
I shot them people at the airport.

159
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,474
Officer Mike.

160
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,354
- Papi. That's "daddy," right?
- Yeah.

161
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:58,652
Mike, you go to therapy
to get your issues worked out...

162
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:00,654
not bang your therapist.

163
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:04,283
- See, now you just talking nasty.
- I gotta survive.

164
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,077
I gotta start loving me for me.

165
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,371
That sound like that group thing.

166
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,332
Maybe I did the group thing
once or twice.

167
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:15,419
And:

168
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:21,884
A bunch of men hugging and kissing,
that's some cult shit.

169
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,048
Buy.

170
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,092
Ignore him, doc, he's blowing
this out of proportion.

171
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:49,221
My ass is what's out of proportion,
Mike, okay? I got a big chunk missing.

172
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,889
It's actually a small chunk.

173
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,433
This tension you bringing
into this relationship...

174
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,227
won't be healthy in the long run.

175
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,521
Maybe there ain't gonna be no long run.

176
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,897
Whatever.

177
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,400
He's seeing a shrink. I mean:

178
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,948
- Icepick, Lowrey.
- Hey, brother.

179
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:11,159
Two bags? You embarrassed me
in front of my people.

180
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:14,621
Wait, brother. No, no, no, brother.
Wait, wait, wait.

181
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,541
Whatever. You better pray
to whoever it is you pray to...

182
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,253
because you got 24 hours
to find that X before I find you.

183
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:29,803
The cops hit my mule.

184
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:32,806
Well, Mr. Tapia, I don't know
where the heat is coming from.

185
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,767
It's a delicate situation
for both of us, isn't it?

186
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:39,229
- I'm telling you, I've checked them.
- Alex, look. A guy's OD'ing.

187
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,814
I'm sorry, I gotta hang up.

188
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,442
Some fucking punk
thinks he can die in my club.

189
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,530
Ecstasy fucks them up.

190
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:53,702
- Get him out of here, Josef.
- Sure. We'll dump him around the block.

191
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,000
Dump him.

192
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,688
Auntie Syd, it must be so cool.

193
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,066
Young, single, living in New York.

194
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,526
Probably hook up
with a lot of cute guys.

195
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:30,322
- Just like Sex and the City.
- Theresa, cancel the damn cable.

196
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,408
So, Auntie Syd, you're a cop too, huh?

197
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,328
Sort of. I work for the DEA,
but I just push a lot of papers.

198
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,789
- Nothing exciting.
- Well, you keep pushing papers.

199
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,668
Don't have to worry about
my little sister fighting crime.

200
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:43,919
Okay?

201
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:46,755
Possibly getting hurt.

202
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,093
James. Get my screwdriver. Damn bolts.

203
00:16:51,302 --> 00:16:53,553
Ignore him. He's being mean
because he got injured.

204
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,890
- Are you okay?
- His wound is fine. It's...

205
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,768
other things that were affected.

206
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,603
- Theresa!
- What?

207
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:05,315
You It's just nerve damage, that's all.

208
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,860
Y'all not gonna spoil it.

209
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,445
I'll talk to you about it.

210
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,831
It's a donut.

211
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,207
It's a medical thing.

212
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,419
I got it from a maternity store.
You know, pregnant women use it.

213
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,714
They can put one cheek here.
It take pressure off the other cheek.

214
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:31,133
- For you, dog.
- Thoughtful.

215
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,094
Look, man...

216
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,805
last night there was something
different in your eyes.

217
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:40,434
You know, Mike, I had an epiphany.
You know?

218
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:44,146
- I realised you're an enigma.
- Yeah, I could see that.

219
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:47,315
God sent you here to test me.
But guess what.

220
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,444
You not gonna break me, Mike. No.

221
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:54,448
Is that Syd?

222
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,658
- That's Syd.
- Now's not a good time.

223
00:17:56,868 --> 00:17:58,869
Mike, listen, now's not a good time.

224
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,579
Hit me, hit me, hit me.

225
00:18:01,164 --> 00:18:03,665
No throwing balls in the house.

226
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,590
- What's up, Theresa?
- Hey.

227
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,800
Aw, they ain't tell me it was a luau.

228
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,428
Hey, hey.

229
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,639
Hey, whoa, Syd.
Hold up. Hold up. Hold on.

230
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,517
Behave yourself, girl. Hey, hold up.
Hold up. Hold up.

231
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:25,228
Oh, look at you. Look at you.

232
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,522
Oh, okay. Okay. I see now.

233
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,317
You didn't tell Marcus about New York.

234
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:33,737
- He knows about New York.
- About us? You told him about us?

235
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,822
No, he knows about New York.

236
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:40,202
You know, it's a nice city and that I
dropped a witness off last month.

237
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:45,290
Mike is so sweet.

238
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,920
- So sweet he make your teeth rot.
- So have you told him yet?

239
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:53,173
Baby, soon, okay? Real soon.

240
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,760
He needs to know you're transferring
and won't be his partner anymore.

241
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,678
Theresa, timing is everything.

242
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,014
Marcus is not very happy
with me right now.

243
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,016
- Mike.
- No, no, Syd, I'm telling you.

244
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:04,851
That is Scarface
limping around in there.

245
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:08,104
We need to give that boy a few
minutes to let his butt heal up good.

246
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,190
We like each other. What's the big deal?

247
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,360
I'm just gonna go tell him right now,
because this is dumb.

248
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,612
Hold up. Hold up. I'm gonna tell him.

249
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,198
It ain't like I won't tell him.
How am I not tell him?

250
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,075
- When?
- I need a minute.

251
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,870
Straight up. We're not vibing
right now. I just need a minute.

252
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,208
Mike, he's my brother, okay?
Don't be scared. Toughen up, chief.

253
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:31,169
Hey. Hey, I ain't say I was scared.

254
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,504
Just

255
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,339
There's something wrong
with your brother.

256
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,720
So, Mike, I understand you
were in New York last month.

257
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,600
Yeah, I was...

258
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,144
- Remember I did the thing?
- No.

259
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:49,646
You remember?

260
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:53,650
The two of you should've gotten
together. That would've been nice.

261
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,778
I never told you Mike was in New York.

262
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:58,864
Well, you know what, Mike?

263
00:19:59,073 --> 00:20:02,284
Syd, she's gonna be in town,
what, another week?

264
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:04,619
Why don't you show her around?
That'd be nice.

265
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,204
That would be so great.

266
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,499
Yeah. Yeah, I could Well, me and...

267
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:13,378
Marcus, you wanna show her some stuff?

268
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,132
Yeah, because I'm in town on vacation.

269
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,217
I'm staying at the most amazing hotel.

270
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,304
The view, the pool. Oh, my God.

271
00:20:22,513 --> 00:20:24,389
We got a pool right here.

272
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:26,850
That ain't exactly a pool, man.

273
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,478
That's like a big-ass puddle
wrapped in blue plastic.

274
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,398
Didn't they have any good pools
when you bought this one?

275
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,650
Megan, that pool cost $3900.

276
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,153
Okay, so how much
do the good pools cost?

277
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,947
- It's all right, baby.
- It is kind of whack, huh?

278
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:45,035
I gotta go meet somebody.
It was nice seeing you again, Mike.

279
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,203
Nice Good to see you.

280
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,706
Where you going?

281
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,999
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

282
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,876
I thought you were on vacation.

283
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,337
So glad you could join us, Mike.

284
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,506
I'm telling you, spending time like this
make a partnership strong.

285
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,550
Mike, can I see you by my stupid pool?

286
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,345
What's the deal, baby?

287
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:07,182
Why you gotta always come over
here and try to take over, Mike?

288
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,560
- What are you talking about?
- This is my family, man. Okay?

289
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,063
- What are you talking about?
- My place of peace.

290
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,981
Are you taking medication?

291
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,192
You taking medicine
for the thing, right?

292
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,527
- What'd I do?
- Forget it. Just forget it.

293
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,322
- What'd I do?
- Mason, go fetch.

294
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,581
Oh, shit!

295
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,921
Now, that shit is funny.

296
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,423
That's some funny shit.

297
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:42,425
Oh, man, hold up.

298
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,469
Yo, Lowrey, you hot.

299
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,055
Thirty-nine hundred dollars.
Thirty-nine hundred.

300
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,892
You better pray to God you right
this time. Yo, dry off, sweetheart.

301
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:54,270
Icepick said the Haitian Zoepounds
about to do a rip. Let's move.

302
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,535
All right, guys, smarten up. Talk to me.

303
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,371
Eyes on, agents. Good luck.

304
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,665
This is 105.

305
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,127
They're backing in.

306
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,712
I got a good look.

307
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,464
- We got a good eyeball.
- All right, we're in.

308
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,305
What's up?

309
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:40,358
You come highly recommended
out of New York.

310
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,778
You did some good jobs
for our Russian crew up there.

311
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,321
How old are you?

312
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,906
Old enough.

313
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:50,452
Come on. If you wanna move
this stuff you gotta do it quick.

314
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,873
Wow, nice getup. You can start
to run these through.

315
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,916
I'd like to see how your machine works.

316
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,545
That sounded dirty.

317
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:03,882
"I would like to see how
your machine works, baby."

318
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,718
I wouldn't be so crude.

319
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,345
I mean, I'm more of a refined kind
of a human being.

320
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,682
You follow ballet?

321
00:23:13,684 --> 00:23:17,604
Three of my cousins are dancing with
the famous Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow.

322
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,192
I like hippie-hop too.

323
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,324
I gave you 5000.

324
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,867
You gave me 4900.

325
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,911
- I gave you 5000.
- Forty-nine hundred.

326
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
- Five thousand.
- Count it.

327
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,874
If you want to fuck with me again,
find yourself another chump.

328
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,542
Okay.

329
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,005
- How much?
- Three.

330
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:46,758
Look at this. Money everywhere.
Clean it up.

331
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:51,054
Okay, we wanna change a little
over $3 million, all right?

332
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:54,641
How many jobs did you do with
my friends up there in New York?

333
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,892
Quite a few.

334
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:59,187
How you behave with me
has consequences for a lot of people.

335
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,523
You found me, not the other way around.

336
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:05,193
You need me to change small bills to
large ones and deliver to a third party.

337
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,612
I bet he'd like his money
in a timely fashion.

338
00:24:07,822 --> 00:24:10,406
Delivery's late,
it's your ass, not mine.

339
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:26,881
Here's 50,000 in 100s
for your 50,000 in 10s.

340
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,759
Third party takes his million
in these five briefcases here.

341
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,846
- I hope I'm not losing you, chief.
- I hate math.

342
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,682
So for your $3 million
that we shrunk for you...

343
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:38,059
you get 2 million in clean money back.

344
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:41,187
Less our percentage: $300,000.

345
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:44,983
- I'll be delivering these to your dealer.
- Alexei.

346
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,318
- What?
- We're giving too fucking much away.

347
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,237
We take all the risk.

348
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:53,032
And our suppliers take too much
of our profit.

349
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:56,411
Yeah, we'll call the general,
renegotiate.

350
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,664
He's a businessman, we're businessmen.

351
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:01,583
Yeah, call him.

352
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,084
You call.

353
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,962
Agents, we're on the move
to the money drop.

354
00:25:07,131 --> 00:25:08,631
Forward.

355
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,801
Hey, man, the truck's leaving.
We're going to follow it.

356
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:17,098
Don't lose that truck.

357
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,436
Follow that truck. Follow that truck.

358
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,865
Yep, they saddling up.
Look like Icepick came through.

359
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,659
Wonder whose shit they about to rip now?

360
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,119
Falcon One, do you see her?

361
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,831
Stand by.

362
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,292
I don't wanna get spotted, take a burn.

363
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:28,878
Zoepound a bunch of pirates, man.
Steal anything.

364
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,895
Black Suburban at 10 o'clock.

365
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:49,315
Oh, come on, baby. Park it at the top.

366
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,192
Roberto, she's coming to you.

367
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:56,406
I got her.

368
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,494
This is Falcon One, guys.
I got her coming up.

369
00:27:01,704 --> 00:27:04,163
Heads up, guys.
I got an orange muscle car.

370
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,708
Looks to be three black male occupants.

371
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:09,252
It's out of our field of vision.
Bring it up.

372
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,879
All right, be aware,
we got three bogeys unidentified.

373
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,727
Guys, we got three bogeys.
They're splitting up. They're moving.

374
00:27:25,936 --> 00:27:27,812
Be aware. They're approaching
Shit. Shit.

375
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,776
- Fuck, it's a hit!
- Shit.

376
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,954
Agent down. Agent down.

377
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:48,791
Roberto, fucking follow them!

378
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,501
- I'm on it! I'm on it!
- Shit!

379
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:52,587
Stay here!

380
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,297
Son of a bitch!

381
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:36,339
It's Syd!

382
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,384
Move! Move!

383
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,306
Man, what is your sister into?

384
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,985
Sidewalk! Sidewalk!

385
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,571
Move! Move! Move!

386
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,866
Shit.

387
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,546
- Shit!
- I need backup on Canal, now!

388
00:29:22,678 --> 00:29:24,429
You just get ready to shoot.

389
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,475
Police!

390
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,061
Stop the car!

391
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:35,189
Man, your badge? He has a gun!
Shoot him!

392
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,874
Mike, she's in trouble, man.

393
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,462
Move! Get out of the way!

394
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,644
I think I done just got mad.

395
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,572
- Gun! Gun! Gun!
- Hold on.

396
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,751
Now show them your badge!

397
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,159
- This shit is crazy.
- I know, right?

398
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:11,953
Move! Move!

399
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:33,057
Get the world down here!

400
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,078
Mag.

401
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:01,252
Shit!

402
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,095
Go! Go!

403
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:21,230
Get out!

404
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,190
You, drive!

405
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,408
Go!

406
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,543
Go, go, go, Mike! Punch that shit!
Punch it!

407
00:33:04,775 --> 00:33:06,150
Kill the fucker!

408
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,912
Shit!

409
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:24,710
Move! Move!

410
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,342
- Don't lose her, Mike!
- This is what I do!

411
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:50,236
Shit! Shit.

412
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,446
Definitely shoot
that motherfucker that just

413
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,115
Oh, man, my headlight.

414
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,618
Shoot back! Shoot back! Shoot! Shoot!

415
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:12,425
What the? What are you doing, man?

416
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,760
- That's my bad.
- Shoot outside!

417
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,804
Pay attention to what you're doing.

418
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:36,407
These dudes is off the chain!

419
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:48,002
Jesus! Fuck!

420
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:58,220
- This is some sick shit!
- Yep, it's about to get sicker.

421
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,441
Watch out! Watch out!

422
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,527
Oh, sh!

423
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:17,031
- Oh, they are not about to do that.
- Hell, yes, they are!

424
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,741
Go!

425
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,712
- You see that?
- They throwing cars! How can I not?

426
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:39,762
- I'm just trying to help, okay?
- You know what'd be fucking helpful?

427
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,556
Just shut the fuck up and let me drive!
Let's try that!

428
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,900
Hey, come on, man,
with the screaming shit!

429
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,196
I'm concentrating on dodging
these motherfuckers.

430
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,829
Just relax.

431
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,212
- That was a flip!
- That motherfucker flipped!

432
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,757
- That one puckered up my butthole.
- Almost fucking crushed my head.

433
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,903
The boat!

434
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:04,054
I lost them. Yeah, I've got your cargo
to the backup drop point.

435
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,895
Attention all units,
suspects still at large.

436
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:15,149
There she is.

437
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:23,991
What the fuck is going on, Syd?

438
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:26,285
Some desk you're driving.

439
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:29,580
Get over here, I'm undercover.
And please call off your dogs.

440
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,458
I got DEA watching my back,
so don't blow my case.

441
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,002
- We saved your life.
- And I appreciate that.

442
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,671
What I don't appreciate is
you two following me here...

443
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,341
nearly burning a case
that took five months to set up.

444
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,177
So now we lie to each other?
Is that what we do?

445
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,179
- What do you want me to do?
- All right.

446
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:48,849
- Fuck that, Mike, she's wrong.
- Calm down. Relax.

447
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:51,018
Syd, are there drugs in that truck?

448
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,062
- There's cash.
- Where's it going?

449
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,773
- I can't tell you that.
- Why not?

450
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,318
Because I have a career and if I
wanna keep it, I have rules to follow.

451
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,611
What's that mean?

452
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,323
My orders are, under no circumstances
share information with Miami P.D...

453
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,910
- because they got too many leaks.
- Oh, I'm Miami P.D. now?

454
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,037
You done forgot
I'm your big brother, huh?

455
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:13,123
You know what, Syd,
that shit you did was reckless...

456
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:16,168
it was stupid and it was dangerous.
Okay?

457
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:20,631
I'm telling Mommy. Okay?
I'm definitely leaking that shit.

458
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,007
Hey, Marcus

459
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,178
Syd, come on, he got a point.

460
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,013
Your brother loves you.

461
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:31,016
Not to mention a little thing
called professional courtesy.

462
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:34,770
You bouncing in somebody's yard,
you should let them know about it.

463
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:42,027
First time using your gun?

464
00:38:43,196 --> 00:38:46,115
Hey, you handled yourself very well.

465
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:48,367
Too bad your partner didn't notice.

466
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,412
Thanks.

467
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:54,707
Think you get off that easy?
You been working this for five months?

468
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,583
How come you ain't tell me in New York?

469
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,585
- What would you have said?
- I would've

470
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,463
I'd have let you know this job
is rugged, you know.

471
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,299
It's dangerous. And if something
happen to you I might...

472
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,469
Exactly why I didn't say anything.

473
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,562
Somebody stealing your money.

474
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,651
The drop's done. I gotta go.

475
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:28,782
Thanks.

476
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,970
We gotta close this case
before it get her killed.

477
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:51,680
Yeah, no doubt.

478
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:54,767
You ready to go back to the station,
get our asses whupped?

479
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,561
I think we gonna be all right.

480
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,564
Fellas.

481
00:40:00,774 --> 00:40:02,775
What's your job description?

482
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:04,485
No, you two.

483
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:07,529
What is your job description?

484
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:08,739
I'll tell you.

485
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,158
TNT:

486
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:14,119
Tactical Narcotics Team.

487
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,622
Keyword: "tactical."

488
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:21,877
"Displaying finesse and subtlety
in achieving a goal!"

489
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,797
Tell me, gentlemen...

490
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:29,134
what was subtle about your work today?

491
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,558
Twenty-two cars...

492
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:39,019
and a boat, totalled?

493
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,231
How did you sink a boat?

494
00:40:45,527 --> 00:40:47,236
We didn't sink it.

495
00:40:58,248 --> 00:41:01,208
All right, the positive.
Thank God no cops died.

496
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:06,463
The negative: I got a police
commissioner so far up my ass...

497
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:09,716
if he spits,
it's coming out of my mouth.

498
00:41:11,845 --> 00:41:15,347
But I know that there's
always two sides to a story.

499
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:17,349
So, what's yours?

500
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,185
Well, I was at a family barbecue.

501
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,229
We got a tip that the Zoepounders...

502
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:26,024
were gonna do a hit on cash or
drugs from this big-time X-man.

503
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,652
That's what they call
a ecstasy dealer on the streets.

504
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:30,988
Marcus, I know what they call them.

505
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,115
That's why I'm captain. It's cool.

506
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,117
So you got the drugs.

507
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:39,955
No drugs. Oh, okay. All right.
How about the money?

508
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:41,540
- No money.
- Nope.

509
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,208
Then who is this X-man?

510
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,086
Captain, I was at a family barbecue.
So I

511
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:49,131
We don't know,
but we are going to find out.

512
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,300
Well, then all that...

513
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,052
- was for nothing?
- We didn't do all of that.

514
00:41:54,262 --> 00:41:57,055
If you look close
Watch. Hold up. Let me s

515
00:41:57,307 --> 00:42:00,934
There's DEA all over.
Wait, the Wait, hold up.

516
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,228
The DEA? Without consulting me?

517
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,063
That's a DEA car right there.

518
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:07,941
Christ! Fuck!

519
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:11,528
Cap. No. Remember your pressure points.

520
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:14,114
Do my My exercises.

521
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:16,158
Holler at your boy.

522
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:20,787
Twenty-one thousand? What?

523
00:42:21,414 --> 00:42:24,583
Oh, kiss my black ass.

524
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,002
It was the dashboard.

525
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:30,172
- You know what?
- Better.

526
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,840
Yeah, you'll get your money.

527
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,218
Somebody's on they way with your money.

528
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:39,932
Is it possible we could discuss
potential reimbursement

529
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:43,227
We don't cover personal property.
That's why we drive police cars.

530
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:45,103
So where do we go from here?

531
00:42:46,022 --> 00:42:48,982
Zoepounders knew exactly when
to hit the drop, where to hit the drop...

532
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:51,151
so we figure they know
where the cash is.

533
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:53,195
We find the cash, we find the X-man.

534
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,740
Hey, I'm through playing games,
all right? I have three cops critical.

535
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,743
I got kids dying on my streets
from souped-up X.

536
00:42:59,953 --> 00:43:03,747
I do not want these animals
taking over my city.

537
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,082
Do you understand?

538
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:09,044
So I want you guys to do whatever you
do, whatever it takes, but do it now.

539
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,345
It's not good, boss.

540
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,227
Oh, my God.

541
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:30,816
Fucking ratones eating my fucking money.

542
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:36,738
Carlos, this is a stupid
fucking problem to have.

543
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:40,409
But it is a problem nonetheless.

544
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:42,536
Rat fuckers.

545
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,329
Rat fuckers.

546
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,292
Boss, it ended up crazy.

547
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:52,796
This black chica working for the
Russians was a maniac lunatic.

548
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:54,006
She saved your money.

549
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,550
She wasted some Haitians
and got the load to the drop.

550
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,636
Also, Roberto saw these two
crazy gangbanger homeys.

551
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:01,680
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah. Chasing and shooting.

552
00:44:02,307 --> 00:44:04,808
Old days, did I have this problem? No.

553
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:08,603
Just fly the drugs in
and ship the money out.

554
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:14,609
Now American security's
so goddamned tight over the water...

555
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:15,986
and in the sky...

556
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,531
that the rats eat my money
before I can get it to Cuba.

557
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,994
- You see?
- Fiery crash...

558
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:28,123
I can't even get my money across town
without making the news.

559
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:31,626
Hey, man. Man.

560
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:33,462
Tell me...

561
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:36,048
should I be worried?

562
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,383
- No, boss.
- Shut the fuck up.

563
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,762
People is trying to jack my loads
here in Miami.

564
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:44,890
I own this fucking town. You see?

565
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,558
This is my town.

566
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:50,812
Oh, my God. Pink.

567
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,107
Pink, niña, pink. Pink. No powder blue.

568
00:44:54,317 --> 00:44:55,484
Pink is prettier.

569
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,737
But the lady at the store
said I look like a model.

570
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,493
You're lucky your mother
was my mother's cousins.

571
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:06,495
Don't pay attention to Roberto.

572
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,624
Besides, models are filthy creatures.

573
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,793
You look more like an angel.

574
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,712
- What do you think, Carlos?
- Of course.

575
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,715
- Roberto, what do you think?
- It's fucking beautiful.

576
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:24,012
Talk polite in front
of my little bonbon...

577
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:27,641
or I'm gonna chop your balls off.

578
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:33,480
For real, I'm straight with all your
spiritual enlightenment and that shit.

579
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:37,234
But I need to know if a crackhead rolls
to me with a .9, you'll cook that fool.

580
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:39,653
No question about it.
Shoot him in the leg.

581
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,321
Come on with that leg shit.

582
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:44,574
- Everybody deserves a little dignity.
- What about my dignity?

583
00:45:44,784 --> 00:45:47,661
Your crackhead will be missing
a kneecap. I'll be in a body bag.

584
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,913
- So sad.
- What's so sad?

585
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:52,749
Your untreated control issues.

586
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:54,334
It's not your fault.

587
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,087
What in the hell
is that supposed to mean?

588
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:00,507
Your mama probably refused you
her tit when you were a baby.

589
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:03,468
You grew up a malnourished
high-school softie.

590
00:46:03,678 --> 00:46:06,221
Got your gun, little tight T-shirt...

591
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:09,057
and became a overcompensating tough guy.

592
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:15,313
That is the last time you will ever
refer to my mother's titties.

593
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:18,567
I don't even want them up in your head.

594
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:24,531
You know, I said all that, Mike,
and all you heard was "titties."

595
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:28,160
Man, you can't keep suppressing
my spiritual growth, Mike.

596
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:31,621
You need to suppress my mother's
titties out of your psychoanalysis.

597
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:35,584
You just remember one thing, my friend.
I may not always be here.

598
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,714
What's up, Icepick?

599
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:44,801
Jesus is the way, my brothers.
Step inside.

600
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:47,220
You just went number one
on Uncle Mike's shit list.

601
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:50,348
- We got two lousy bags, man.
- My brothers.

602
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,642
Haitian blond with dreads. Where is he?

603
00:46:52,852 --> 00:46:54,394
Blondie Dread?

604
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:58,064
He's very expensive.

605
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:02,027
You and you have to do something for me.

606
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,571
Oh, you trying to get gangster
on me like that?

607
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,073
- Yeah, he went gangster.
- So we should probably

608
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,743
- So we wanna do the? You got them?
- Yeah, sure.

609
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:13,914
Me and my partner, we're on
the Miami P.D. tandem dance team.

610
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:16,416
We got a routine.
We won all the local talent shows.

611
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:18,043
We thinking about going national.

612
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,629
You wanna show him some of the routine?

613
00:47:21,047 --> 00:47:23,798
Warm it up. Don't hurt nothing.

614
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,383
Yo, yo, watch this. Watch this.

615
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:27,886
This the shit right here.
This is the shit.

616
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,731
- What you doing to my shop?
- Watch this spin.

617
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,066
Wait.

618
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:46,238
- What are you doing?
- Oh, give me some.

619
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:48,073
You're ruining my shop. Stop!

620
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:51,451
- Do the dance thing.
- I'm gonna bring the house down.

621
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,292
Stop! Stop!

622
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:03,880
He lives in a pink house
eight blocks from here on Carl Street.

623
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:11,137
One...

624
00:48:11,931 --> 00:48:13,640
- Police! Get down.
- Police!

625
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,761
Who that? Who in my house?

626
00:48:51,971 --> 00:48:56,099
- I'm the devil, who's asking?
- The devil is not welcome here!

627
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:59,311
You got to call yourself the devil
in his house? Shit!

628
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,188
You're in my house!

629
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,190
This is all your fault!

630
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:07,027
- You're in my country, though.
- Fuck you, how's that?

631
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:10,155
- I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker!
- Your country, my ass!

632
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,825
- Fuck you.
- Fuck me? Fuck you!

633
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,452
You no problem!

634
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,330
Mike, do you have to be so combative?

635
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,040
Fucking!

636
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:22,375
You calling me a bitch?

637
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:26,046
Do or die, man!

638
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:29,341
A bullet in the head will
really mess up your extensions.

639
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:32,177
Take your bullet and eat that shit, man.

640
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,970
How about that?

641
00:49:38,893 --> 00:49:40,268
What the?

642
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:51,071
Sir, we just wanna talk.

643
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,823
You wanna talk? Well, go ahead.
Go ahead.

644
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,575
We're not Immigration.

645
00:49:55,785 --> 00:49:58,912
They can't hear you because
they're still shooting at you.

646
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,124
Fucking Haitians in
a fucking little-ass room...

647
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:05,877
with fucking guns. Shit!

648
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,434
Got to make it home to my babies.
Damn, now.

649
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,069
Motherfucker! You killed my brother!

650
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,574
That's a bitch!

651
00:50:37,827 --> 00:50:39,786
Shoot them. Fucking shoot them.

652
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:45,583
They shot me. They got me, man. Yo!

653
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:00,974
Got you.

654
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,896
Oh, shit! Motherfucker!

655
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:08,314
They killed the boy!

656
00:51:08,524 --> 00:51:09,733
They kill me!

657
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:11,651
They're killing everybody!

658
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:14,654
Motherfucker!

659
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:21,161
My eyes!

660
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,163
I'm gonna kill you, motherfucker!

661
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,669
Come. Come kill me, motherfucker.

662
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:31,963
Come. You don't take me alive.

663
00:51:32,173 --> 00:51:34,090
You got three seconds
to drop your weapon!

664
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,759
I got a present for you!

665
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,927
- A nice present for you!
- One!

666
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,639
- Two!
- I'm gonna kill you.

667
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:52,525
Don't shoot. Don't shoot, man.
Don't kill me.

668
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:59,491
- Bullets and all Excuse me.
- You all right, man?

669
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:05,163
Apologise to that man.
Apologise to that man.

670
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,665
Apologise! Apologise.

671
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,293
Hey, listen, I owe you

672
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:13,171
It's just that, you know,
you was disrespect

673
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,174
But that don't mean it give me
the right, though. It don't.

674
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,842
Excuse me.

675
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:20,887
Whoosah, motherfucker!

676
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:27,352
See, the interesting thing is he's
the one of us that's not pissed off.

677
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,313
- I don't know nothing.
- I didn't ask you no question yet!

678
00:52:30,523 --> 00:52:32,023
- I don't know nothing.
- Lying already?

679
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:34,317
- No, get
- How'd you know about the drop?

680
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:36,319
- I don't know nothing!
- Stop lying!

681
00:52:36,529 --> 00:52:37,987
Do you know anything?

682
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:41,157
I'm gonna be nice about it.
Do you know anything?

683
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,326
Let's ask some other suspects.

684
00:52:43,536 --> 00:52:46,746
- Hey, look, man, fuck it.
- Let's try this. Let's talk to his homeys.

685
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,457
Hey, look here, man.

686
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:53,419
Can you tell me who was driving
the black Suburban?

687
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,631
Oh, he don't know nothing.

688
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:59,092
His brains is under the end table.

689
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,972
He can't tell us shit, Mike.

690
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,724
- He's all fucked up.
- What's your point?

691
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:09,352
Dead suspects can't say shit.

692
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:13,565
It seems like live suspects don't say
shit either, so I'll hot this dude here.

693
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:15,900
- Save us the paperwork.
- I don't know nothing!

694
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:19,279
I don't do motherfucking surveillance,
man. He do surveillance.

695
00:53:19,488 --> 00:53:21,781
He don't let nobody touch his camera.

696
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:27,120
- What's on that camera?
- Trigger Mike strikes again.

697
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:29,914
Hi, welcome to Phat's.
How can I help you?

698
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:33,042
- Miami P.D.
- Whoa, Cops. I love that show.

699
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:35,712
- We need to see what's on this video.
- Absolutely.

700
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:39,507
You got a little bullet hole in there.
You guys tell me about it?

701
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:43,094
Guess not. We'll put this
in our central floor model.

702
00:53:43,304 --> 00:53:45,597
It has kick-ass bass.
You like hip-hop? I love it.

703
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:49,517
We freestyle in the break room. If you
guys ever wanna kick it, we'll flow.

704
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:53,271
We're gonna set you up on
the wide-screen. Correct ratio.

705
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:55,148
There you go.

706
00:53:58,152 --> 00:54:00,737
"Spanish Palms Mortuary."

707
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:04,782
Why would they be doing
surveillance at a funeral home?

708
00:54:05,326 --> 00:54:06,659
Is that a Cuban flag?

709
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:08,745
Right there. See the gun?

710
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:12,957
Never knew guards at funeral homes
needed to carry them kind of weapons.

711
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:18,212
It just seems like
we should turn it off...

712
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:19,964
because my dad owns the store.

713
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,799
She got a tongue ring.

714
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:26,596
- This is like a porno. We're not
- Dude. Dude.

715
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,139
- All right?
- Yeah.

716
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,392
Okay. Okay.

717
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,978
It's just, you know, my dad's gonna be

718
00:54:34,188 --> 00:54:35,730
I just need to I think I

719
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,982
- I think I screwed this up.
- Relax.

720
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:42,737
- My dad's gonna This is like a porno.
- Oh, yeah. I want more.

721
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,076
- Okay.
- This is official police business.

722
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,162
- What the fuck's going on here?
- Out of my way.

723
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:54,207
My dad is coming.
My dad is coming. My dad is coming.

724
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,960
What the hell is going on in my store?

725
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:00,964
Son, how did this porno crap get
on my videos in my store?

726
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,967
What the hell is going on in here?

727
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:09,055
- You all right?
- No, I'm not all right, Mike.

728
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:13,267
Three days of this shit.
Got my nerves all rattled.

729
00:55:17,106 --> 00:55:18,856
My ass still hurts...

730
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:22,110
from what you did to it the other night.

731
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:23,820
Oh, my Lord.

732
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:26,114
Yeah, it got rough.

733
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:27,991
You know?

734
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,078
I mean, we got caught up
in the moment, shit got crazy.

735
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,413
You know how I get.

736
00:55:36,417 --> 00:55:40,003
When you popped me from behind,
I think you damaged some nerves.

737
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:41,629
Okay.

738
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,090
Now, I can't

739
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,135
I can't Now, I can't...

740
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:51,514
- Can't what?
- I can't even get an erection.

741
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:53,850
What's an erection?

742
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:57,937
I tried taking Viagra, you know,
pop one, pop two.

743
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,981
Been eating them like Skittles.

744
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,859
That poor man is pouring out his heart.

745
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,695
And I'm still flaccid.

746
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,698
Okay. I'm comfortable talking to you...

747
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,992
It's got 5. 1 Dolby.

748
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:14,287
...about what I did to your ass...

749
00:56:14,955 --> 00:56:17,248
but you not getting an erection...

750
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,251
that's a real problem for me.

751
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:22,920
- I just figured I could talk to you.
- Yeah. No, no.

752
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:27,467
We're We partners, but we are
partners with boundaries.

753
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:29,886
We got a new rule.

754
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:34,057
From now on you can't say
the word "flaccid" to me.

755
00:56:34,558 --> 00:56:36,142
He's a mean fuck.

756
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,644
Look here.
This is our little boundary box.

757
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,688
So we gonna take the word "flaccid"...

758
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,608
and we're gonna put it in there
with my mom's titties...

759
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:47,070
with your erection problems,
and we're gonna close this box...

760
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:49,363
and we're gonna throw
this bitch in the ocean.

761
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:52,617
And the only way that you can
get to this box...

762
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,745
is you got to be motherfucking
Jacques Cousteau.

763
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,580
We cool?

764
00:57:02,127 --> 00:57:03,503
No...

765
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,839
Oh, shit.

766
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:09,092
We gotta go.

767
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:12,637
In front of my babies you got porno
and homo shows up in here?

768
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:15,014
What kind of freak-ass store is this?

769
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,810
And you two motherfuckers need Jesus.

770
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,645
Cover your ears, baby.

771
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:24,273
Palm Mortuary, owned by an offshore
holding company...

772
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:26,442
which, after 17 layers of bullshit...

773
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:29,821
turns out to be registered
to Donna Maria Tapia...

774
00:57:30,072 --> 00:57:33,741
mother of Hector Juan Carlos Tapia,
who calls himself Johnny.

775
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:36,077
Johnny Tapia. Shit.

776
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,329
Every time the P.D. goes after him...

777
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:41,707
he sues for wrongful arrest.
And, oh, does he win.

778
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:44,502
Look. Last year,
he was awarded $9 million.

779
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:47,755
And got a dozen dumb-ass officers
like you fired.

780
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:50,007
Well, he hasn't run across us yet.

781
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:52,510
We'd love to hear what's going on
in that house.

782
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,138
Use your computer brain
and tap the phone.

783
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:01,644
Well, that happens to be
highly illegal without a judge.

784
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:07,400
We were thinking of something more
along the lines of a training operation.

785
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:08,860
No, I can't do that.

786
00:58:09,069 --> 00:58:11,571
- Get you tickets to the Heat game.
- I need floor seats.

787
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:14,157
With thick-ass glasses
you don't need floor seats.

788
00:58:14,366 --> 00:58:16,159
He can see the game
from the parking lot.

789
00:58:16,368 --> 00:58:20,079
- I can't work under these conditions.
- Floor seats to the Heat. You got it.

790
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:22,582
- Lakers.
- Yes, Lakers.

791
00:58:22,791 --> 00:58:24,458
Okay. Watch me work.

792
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:38,472
Hello? Is this the pest control?

793
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:41,309
Yeah. We got a fucking problem.

794
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,894
You know where we live.

795
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:44,145
- Yeah, South Miami.
- We got it.

796
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,148
Got our way in.

797
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,233
- Illegally?
- You gotta put a word to it.

798
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:50,526
It's like, secret.

799
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:52,445
So, y'all wanna kill roaches?

800
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:55,406
- Illegal.
- We'll plant a couple gypsy wires...

801
00:58:55,616 --> 00:58:57,033
find out what Tapia's up to.

802
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,493
These are your basic household bugs.

803
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,078
Dog, this is what we do.

804
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:07,668
- What's the sprayers for?
- The roaches.

805
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:11,255
- Roaches? We got rats.
- Say what?

806
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:13,633
That's not an issue. We can handle that.

807
00:59:13,842 --> 00:59:17,011
We'll just have to slightly adjust
our approach a little bit.

808
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,097
Nope. Nope. I don't mess with no rats.

809
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:22,225
Hey. Stop it.

810
00:59:22,434 --> 00:59:25,895
- We're in. Get your head right.
- Mike, I'm a grown-ass man.

811
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,731
Get your grown-ass self together
and let's do this.

812
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:32,401
This is a beautiful house
you got here, sir.

813
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:34,195
Well, start looking.

814
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:36,864
They're all over.

815
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:45,581
Those ain't normal rats.

816
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,542
What he means is that they're
obviously a special breed.

817
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:51,254
- What kind of breed are they?
- Big motherfuckers.

818
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,839
Disposing of the rats isn't a problem.

819
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:56,884
But we should ensure there's no
breeding elsewhere in the house.

820
00:59:57,094 --> 00:59:58,803
Yeah, at Zook...

821
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:02,098
we like to work from the outside in,
you know.

822
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:05,017
So we gonna leave these Excuse me.

823
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:07,687
We'll leave these here
and send in a special unit.

824
01:00:07,896 --> 01:00:10,147
It'd be better to begin
in the rest of the house.

825
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,066
You're not getting
in the rest of the house.

826
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:14,151
We won't be able to guarantee our work.

827
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:16,696
The only thing that we can guarantee...

828
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:19,615
is that these rats will keep fucking.

829
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:22,410
Giving off offspring
until we find the colony.

830
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,704
Rats don't got no stinking colony.

831
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:26,706
Well, actually these are colonial rats.

832
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:30,126
What they do is they send out
worker rats that are called...

833
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,128
Marsupials.

834
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:34,046
Marsupials.

835
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:38,426
These drones, they're explorers
of the rat world, you know.

836
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:41,554
They just looking for rat pussy.

837
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,391
- You know.
- Are you fucking with me?

838
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,269
Hold on. You called us. We can leave.

839
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,856
But what you should understand is
that these rats will hump twice a day.

840
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:55,109
All right. Down there. Just kill them
and bring me the bill.

841
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:00,698
That's that bullshit.
That's that bullshit right there.

842
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,575
- You see these rats?
- Plant your wires.

843
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:05,328
- You're not leaving me with them.
- Plant your wires.

844
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:09,874
Gentlemen. Alexei, Josef.

845
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:13,919
Oh, I really like that word, Johnny.
"Gentlemen."

846
01:01:14,129 --> 01:01:17,715
I'm just trying being civil.
This is business, we can all relax.

847
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:20,343
- Alexei, would you like a Cohiba?
- Why not?

848
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:23,012
Of course. And you? Josef.

849
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:25,806
I'm told you're
quite a wine connoisseur.

850
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,058
I am.

851
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:32,396
Carlos, have Josef pick a wine and
Alexei and I will have a cigar. Come.

852
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:41,572
- Where the fuck you going?
- Pretty bad problem you got here.

853
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:45,076
I'm gonna head down to the truck,
get some poison pellets and stuff.

854
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:47,119
Come straight back. No screwing around.

855
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:52,500
They're all over.

856
01:01:53,001 --> 01:01:55,461
Nice place you got here.

857
01:01:56,755 --> 01:02:01,384
It's Mama's, and it's a shithole.
Built a fucking million years ago.

858
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:04,136
- Expensive shithole, eh?
- Oh, no.

859
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:08,265
My new place,
the one I'm building in Cuba.

860
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:13,062
Almost finished. Everything fucking
shiny new. Come on upstairs.

861
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:15,815
Oh, shit.

862
01:02:16,608 --> 01:02:19,693
Oh, shit! Look at the balls
on that motherfucker.

863
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,152
Roberto...

864
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:05,156
- the general's office camera is out.
- Everything in this house is broken.

865
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:14,081
My wire's planted.

866
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,500
- How about yours?
- Almost got three wires planted.

867
01:03:22,382 --> 01:03:23,591
Mike!

868
01:03:24,426 --> 01:03:28,137
There's a papa rat humping
the shit out of this mama rat.

869
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,806
No, he's straight pile-driving her!

870
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:34,101
Now, how is that information
gonna help me do my job?

871
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:36,353
They fuck just like us.

872
01:03:36,605 --> 01:03:38,314
Where's the pest guy?

873
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,958
There's something going on down here.

874
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:15,184
Goddamn rats.

875
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:18,812
Yeah, they everywhere.
Just like cockroaches.

876
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:20,981
No disrespect...

877
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:25,319
but I do not wish to talk business
until my partner return.

878
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:29,490
It's baffling. You secretly decide to pay
me less and you talk about respect?

879
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:33,619
Let's wait for Josef. You know,
me and digits.

880
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:36,789
Carlos, could you bring Josef in?

881
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:52,471
So...

882
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:57,059
your partner is here.

883
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:01,105
Would you like to talk now?

884
01:05:04,234 --> 01:05:05,401
Carlos, another box.

885
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:13,284
So, you sign over ownership papers
for all the Florida clubs you own...

886
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:15,369
and I will control everything...

887
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:17,997
from point of origin to sale. Okay?

888
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:21,709
No middleman.
Especially Russian middleman.

889
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:24,503
With all due respect, Mr. Tapia...

890
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:28,841
in my country,
I see such things all the time.

891
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:30,843
I'm sorry for your country.

892
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:34,763
That must be some Cuban stupid
tradition to put them in a tortilla bin.

893
01:05:34,973 --> 01:05:37,474
Now, listen to me, you Russian punk.

894
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:42,438
I, me, Johnny Tapia,
will sever your head off!

895
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:45,983
You kill me,
and you will have a shit-storm.

896
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,407
Should I screw your young wife...

897
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:56,827
or visit your son, the soccer player?

898
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,998
My daughter knows your son.

899
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:14,637
- You're gonna regret this.
- I hope that we can remain friends.

900
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:18,098
Because at the end, what else
do we have but friendship, trust...

901
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,017
honour?

902
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:25,898
Without this,
we are no more than beasts.

903
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,497
The kitchen monitor's out.

904
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:43,749
What the hell's going on out there?

905
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:48,504
Shit.

906
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,715
I found something.

907
01:06:56,513 --> 01:07:00,140
- It's a guy's finger.
- What, did the rats eat the rest of him?

908
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:04,728
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Hey, I was just looking for you.

909
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:06,939
I think I figured out your problem.

910
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:09,024
Y'all a bunch of filthy motherfuckers.

911
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:12,528
Blow out!

912
01:07:12,737 --> 01:07:14,947
- What's going on? Shit!
- Get out of the house!

913
01:07:19,244 --> 01:07:21,662
This shit's got to stop.

914
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,588
Fuck!

915
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:33,507
We should go.

916
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:38,595
Go! Go!

917
01:07:38,805 --> 01:07:40,431
Just another day with Mike Lowrey.

918
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:49,231
- Damn! Go!
- Come on!

919
01:07:57,907 --> 01:07:59,908
Roberto thinks they were
the gangbangers...

920
01:08:00,118 --> 01:08:02,077
that tried to hijack the drop, boss.

921
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:06,790
How did this thing happen?

922
01:08:09,169 --> 01:08:13,380
I don't know. We called the rat people
and these guys showed up.

923
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,424
Maybe you're the rat, huh?

924
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:20,637
They tried to steal from me,
and you let them into my mother's house.

925
01:08:20,847 --> 01:08:22,890
Johnny. Hey, no.

926
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,850
I would never...

927
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:30,189
Nobody puts in danger
my daughter, my mother...

928
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,274
or my money.

929
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:39,740
Send him to the mortuary.

930
01:08:40,325 --> 01:08:43,869
Johnny. Johnny,
what happened to Roberto?

931
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,538
He killed himself, Mama.

932
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:52,169
- Very sad.
- Write a nice letter to his mother.

933
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,754
I'll do it.

934
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,547
Okay. Bye.

935
01:08:57,509 --> 01:09:00,803
- Yo, run the print.
- Mike, stop playing, man!

936
01:09:01,012 --> 01:09:03,680
- Run the print.
- Don't touch me with no dead finger.

937
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:08,560
Excuse me, run this print.
I need to find the owner.

938
01:09:09,145 --> 01:09:10,187
Thank you.

939
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,773
Think you can find out
what's on these shreds?

940
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,316
Of course.

941
01:09:16,653 --> 01:09:18,862
We're thinking about ordering lunch.

942
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:23,075
Should we put you down for some extra
crispy and a couple of grape sodas?

943
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:26,036
"Couple of grape sodas."

944
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,540
- Very funny. That's hilarious.
- Isn't it low tide?

945
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:30,791
I think it is.

946
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:34,169
- Don't you have relatives to pick up?
- What?

947
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:37,548
Yo, now you crossed the line, man.
Okay, no, that's not funny.

948
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:41,093
We're fucking with you. We planted
wires, we need some help. No bullshit.

949
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,931
I want you...

950
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:51,728
to find out...

951
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:55,274
who those two black puta de mierda are.

952
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:59,570
And I want them lying right here...

953
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:04,116
in Mama's garden in these coffins!

954
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:08,412
And our mystery finger belongs to:

955
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:10,831
Josef Kuninskavich.

956
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,625
Oh, man. He was a lieutenant
in the Russian mob.

957
01:10:13,835 --> 01:10:16,420
Owned a couple dozen Florida nightclubs.

958
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:19,131
Tapia's starting to knock off
Russian mob bosses.

959
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:22,926
Got something.

960
01:10:23,553 --> 01:10:24,595
What you got, dickhead?

961
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:27,431
The computer matches half tones,
grey tones, densities.

962
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,100
Sort of like a visual code-breaking.

963
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:32,311
Little something I put together.

964
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:37,065
The shredded papers was a photo.
Some kind of boat. "Dixie 7."

965
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:38,317
Dixie 7.

966
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:43,530
- It's registered to a one Floyd Poteet.
- Poteet brothers.

967
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:48,493
One of the KKK guys we busted.
You blew his ear off, remember?

968
01:10:48,995 --> 01:10:51,121
Mike, can you teach me
how to shoot people?

969
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:54,416
Listen to what we got at Tapia's.

970
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,467
The second-in-command is talking.

971
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:08,138
He's telling him, "Yes, boss.
We found a bunch of fat doe fuckers...

972
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:11,350
- and we're getting them emptied."
- "Fat does emptied"?

973
01:11:11,559 --> 01:11:14,645
- The hell does that mean?
- He has a meeting this afternoon.

974
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:18,982
- You know who I am?
- Name sounds familiar.

975
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:21,234
Sense of humour. I like that.

976
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:24,780
Meet me on the sand, 2:00, Shore Club.

977
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:28,492
- She has no idea. Let's roll.
- Y'all come with us.

978
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:40,504
I ordered a couple of Bacardi Mojitos.

979
01:11:45,677 --> 01:11:47,010
Miami.

980
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:52,516
Okay, zoom in on nine.
A little more audio, please.

981
01:11:52,725 --> 01:11:55,852
So why don't we take a swim? Cool off.

982
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,857
Or we could just stay here
and get drunk. How about that?

983
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:03,151
Or we could drink this later.

984
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:05,153
Unless you have a reason...

985
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:09,241
why you don't want to get
that beautiful body of yours wet.

986
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:12,577
Why not just ask if I'm wearing a wire?

987
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:16,164
I'd rather go swimming.

988
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,796
- What the hell's he doing?
- Son of a bitch.

989
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:25,549
Shit. He's taking her into the water.

990
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:39,521
This guy's smart.

991
01:12:40,606 --> 01:12:45,444
I want you to work for me. Why waste
time on this unnecessary talking?

992
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:49,406
It's very unnecessary.
What do you need with another banker?

993
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:53,285
For the same reason
as your previous employer.

994
01:12:53,536 --> 01:12:57,247
But now I own all the Russian clubs.
No middleman.

995
01:12:57,457 --> 01:13:00,167
You know, I'm about to be
the biggest importer...

996
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,878
and distributor
of ecstasy in North America.

997
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:05,464
You're gonna be a very rich young woman.

998
01:13:05,673 --> 01:13:07,007
That's why I thought

999
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,885
I know what you thought, Mr. Tapia.

1000
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:12,554
As long as you don't think it
more than once...

1001
01:13:12,764 --> 01:13:15,182
I'm happy to be in business with you.

1002
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:17,893
All right.

1003
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,895
Let's do business.

1004
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:33,492
What are you, a cop or a model?

1005
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:34,993
What you talking about, man?

1006
01:13:35,203 --> 01:13:37,204
Threw something on.
I like looking good. What?

1007
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,747
For who?

1008
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:41,374
Hey, don't hate the player.
Hate the game.

1009
01:13:41,584 --> 01:13:42,959
I hate the tailor.

1010
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:46,630
Good job. We'll get him.

1011
01:13:48,925 --> 01:13:51,426
Your brother would love to talk
to you down the street.

1012
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:53,428
Whoa, what's going on?

1013
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:00,102
You trying to blow my case
or you just insane?

1014
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:02,896
You're the one taking a dip
with the Cubano maniac.

1015
01:14:04,816 --> 01:14:07,025
- How'd you know that?
- We had a wire in the house.

1016
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:10,987
- You two have a warrant for that wire?
- Look, fuck that, okay?

1017
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:13,949
You don't know the kind of danger
that you're in, Syd.

1018
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:18,453
I am fully aware, and I am fully capable
of what I am doing.

1019
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:20,288
I am not your baby sister anymore.

1020
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:22,499
For the DEA,
you ain't nothing but a honeypot.

1021
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:23,792
What'd you just say?

1022
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:27,671
That's why you got the job, because
you look good in a bathing suit.

1023
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,465
All right, let's sit down somewhere.

1024
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:36,096
All right, look, Syd, there's
some shit you need to know.

1025
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:39,891
Johnny Tapia is cutting up Russian
mob bosses in his mom's kitchen.

1026
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:41,476
In the kitchen, Syd.

1027
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:43,895
He found a severed finger
by the crock pot.

1028
01:14:44,105 --> 01:14:46,815
You're about to be in the middle
of a drug war.

1029
01:14:47,441 --> 01:14:51,361
Miami P.D. has arrested this guy
12 times with no convictions.

1030
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:54,114
Why don't you just hang back
and let us bring him down?

1031
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,908
Guys, look, I need this, okay?
And I am this close.

1032
01:14:57,118 --> 01:14:58,160
What's "this close"?

1033
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:01,163
I'm in charge of money laundering
for his entire operation.

1034
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:04,749
In a month or two, we'll have enough
for a conviction, and it'll be over.

1035
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:06,543
What about a day or two? Sound better?

1036
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:10,130
Marcus and I think we found the key
to Tapia's whole operation.

1037
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,090
You have nothing to say now, huh?

1038
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:16,136
- Just stuck, right?
- Okay, time-out, y'all. Damn.

1039
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,180
We got this peckerwood
that'll put us down...

1040
01:15:18,389 --> 01:15:21,933
with the transport end of Tapia's
operation. Do you want in?

1041
01:15:22,143 --> 01:15:23,143
- Why would you?
- When?

1042
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:24,728
- Tonight.
- Page me.

1043
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:26,855
Should I bring my thong?

1044
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:31,943
Get your bitch hands off.
I'll knock you the fuck out.

1045
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:36,198
Mike, we're trying to keep her
out of trouble, man...

1046
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:38,241
not invite her in.

1047
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:40,952
Man, I just figured, you know,
if she with us...

1048
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:44,247
that's just less trouble
she could get into.

1049
01:15:44,457 --> 01:15:48,627
I'm gonna keep it real with you too, man.
I think she can handle herself.

1050
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:52,130
I'm gonna keep it real with you.
Don't nobody know my sister like I do.

1051
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,425
Okay? She doesn't
make good choices, Mike.

1052
01:15:55,635 --> 01:15:58,470
- She's not street-smart.
- Doesn't make good?

1053
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:00,889
- Like, what kind of choices?
- Men, for one.

1054
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,808
She's attracted to these dumb...

1055
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:08,355
flashy, just musclebound dickheads,
Mike. You know?

1056
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:14,361
Cock diesel motherfuckers that can't
even fucking turn to wipe their ass.

1057
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,029
- You feel me?
- Yeah.

1058
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:19,699
You know?
Just dumb as a bucket of shrimp.

1059
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:23,286
Yeah. Yeah. That shit's crazy.

1060
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:26,122
I mean, you don't think maybe you

1061
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:29,251
Maybe you didn't, like,
get a chance to know any of them?

1062
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:31,419
I'm gonna give the next one a chance.

1063
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:34,589
A chance to whup his ass.

1064
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:38,176
- Whup the shit out of him.
- Oh, you gonna fight him?

1065
01:16:38,386 --> 01:16:40,887
What I'm gonna do
ain't even gonna be legal.

1066
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:43,807
I might be up in here
with these motherfuckers.

1067
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:46,142
Do you know what I mean?

1068
01:16:47,395 --> 01:16:48,895
The fuck you looking at?

1069
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,230
Thank you kindly.

1070
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:54,693
- Who sprung me?
- Hey, Cousin Floyd.

1071
01:16:54,902 --> 01:16:56,236
- Oh, you.
- Remember me?

1072
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:02,200
Cheese.

1073
01:17:03,035 --> 01:17:04,327
Y'all look great together.

1074
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:06,746
- What the fuck you doing?
- Just a little insurance.

1075
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:08,748
You gonna help us find Dixie 7...

1076
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:11,418
and tell us what that boat
has to do with Johnny Tapia.

1077
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,462
- I ain't no snitch.
- Oh, you ain't no snitch?

1078
01:17:14,672 --> 01:17:18,466
- Oh, damn. That's a shame.
- Know what I'm gonna do?

1079
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:23,555
I'm gonna send a special 8 x 10
to his KKK buddies back in jail.

1080
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:25,640
You know what, it's a digital photo too.

1081
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,560
So we can do
whatever we want to do with it.

1082
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:30,312
By the time we get done with you...

1083
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:32,981
you gonna be in the next
Busta Rhymes video on BET.

1084
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:34,816
Tuck ass.

1085
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:38,028
I got my rights.

1086
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:41,573
I'm worried.
There's too much heat around in Miami.

1087
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:44,659
I can feel it. I can feel it.

1088
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:49,706
We need to put my money in coffins
to Cuba faster.

1089
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:53,043
You should tell the mortuary
to speed things up. All right?

1090
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:04,554
That's the channel marker way out there.

1091
01:18:04,764 --> 01:18:09,476
They make the drop mostly at dawn,
but there'll be one today, though.

1092
01:18:14,565 --> 01:18:17,859
Syd, you talk to Mama? She's got hives.

1093
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:21,654
Oh, and I told Mama
about your Cubano boyfriend.

1094
01:18:21,864 --> 01:18:23,531
He ain't invited to Christmas dinner.

1095
01:18:23,741 --> 01:18:26,743
Change the station.
More music, less Marcus.

1096
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:31,873
If you open the door, he'll be a black
Dr. Phil for the next 40 minutes.

1097
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,169
Syd, you might not wanna get
too flirty with Mike.

1098
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:39,381
Your boyfriend might cut off
his trigger finger.

1099
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,135
Maybe Mike's been flirting with me.
Did you ever think about that?

1100
01:18:47,098 --> 01:18:48,139
Trigger Mike?

1101
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:50,433
Not like this. Don't play with that boy.

1102
01:18:50,643 --> 01:18:53,812
- Seriously. Don't play with that boy.
- Just tell him about New York.

1103
01:18:54,021 --> 01:18:55,688
- Do it.
- Tell me what?

1104
01:18:55,898 --> 01:18:57,941
Oh, shit. Is he walking down the steps?

1105
01:18:58,609 --> 01:19:01,236
Oh, shit. He coming down.

1106
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:04,114
- It's okay.
- Yeah, you done fucked up.

1107
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:06,366
You done fucked up.

1108
01:19:07,868 --> 01:19:09,202
You remember...

1109
01:19:09,412 --> 01:19:11,246
Remember I went to New York?
You remember?

1110
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:13,373
And...

1111
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,208
I said, "Syd."

1112
01:19:15,543 --> 01:19:16,876
I ran in

1113
01:19:17,294 --> 01:19:20,588
Syd ran into me in New York
on the street in that place.

1114
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,715
And I said:

1115
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:24,217
"What's up?"

1116
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:27,262
And we was hungry, so then...

1117
01:19:28,013 --> 01:19:29,806
she had fish.

1118
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:32,851
It was grouper.

1119
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:35,895
And then I had some chicken.

1120
01:19:36,647 --> 01:19:38,982
Remember, I was supposed to come home?

1121
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:40,775
But I didn't.

1122
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:43,069
We went out on a date.

1123
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:47,031
Five, actually.
Now we're seeing each other.

1124
01:19:48,868 --> 01:19:49,909
Hold up.

1125
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:53,997
You know, really out of respect
for you, Marcus, nothing happened.

1126
01:19:55,332 --> 01:19:57,208
Hey, Mike, why you tripping, man?

1127
01:19:57,418 --> 01:19:59,794
I mean, we wanted to make sure
you was cool with it.

1128
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:03,756
Doesn't matter what I think, you know.
Hey, I had to find out like this, right?

1129
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:05,175
Don't matter.

1130
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:09,387
Let me ask you, y'all gonna have babies?
Little bunch of mini Mikes?

1131
01:20:09,597 --> 01:20:11,598
Bunch of little lying, violent
motherfuckers?

1132
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,600
Marcus, nothing happened.

1133
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:15,894
I just wanna say,
Mama's gonna be thrilled.

1134
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:19,355
All right, you know what, you need to
"whoosah" or something for a second.

1135
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:21,524
Hey, here comes the Dixie 7.

1136
01:20:26,197 --> 01:20:27,280
Just leave it alone.

1137
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:30,408
- Why you acting like that?
- Go on about your business, man.

1138
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:32,994
- We gonna talk about this.
- No. Get out of my face.

1139
01:20:33,204 --> 01:20:36,206
- I'm trying to talk to you.
- Get the fuck off me, Mike.

1140
01:20:36,415 --> 01:20:40,168
What the hell is your problem, man?
Why you acting so stupid?

1141
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:43,505
This is a dysfunctional partnership.
That's why I'm acting like that.

1142
01:20:43,714 --> 01:20:45,131
- You know
- There ain't no trust.

1143
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:46,591
I didn't lie to you!

1144
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,927
I was waiting
for the right time to tell you.

1145
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:50,136
But that ain't your issue.

1146
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:53,473
Why don't you bring it to me real.
What is your problem with this?

1147
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:56,434
You know what? You a dog, man.

1148
01:20:56,644 --> 01:20:59,812
- That's it. There it is. I said it.
- Oh, okay.

1149
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:03,316
You like a pit bull with that little
pink thing hanging out.

1150
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:07,237
Oh, it's like that. Oh, okay.

1151
01:21:07,821 --> 01:21:10,990
I'm not good enough for your sister.

1152
01:21:12,493 --> 01:21:14,661
Guys, enough. The boat's coming.

1153
01:21:15,579 --> 01:21:19,624
Okay. We gonna handle that shit.
Go ahead, man.

1154
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:25,880
In about an hour,
the drop boat's gonna come.

1155
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:43,815
We got them.

1156
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:48,278
Wonder what mortuary
that coffin's going to.

1157
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:03,042
Keep going straight by.

1158
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:10,883
You seeing what I'm seeing?

1159
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:19,642
Get the load to the mortuary
and don't screw up.

1160
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:21,060
I got it.

1161
01:22:21,812 --> 01:22:22,854
Load up.

1162
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:36,200
They're getting away!

1163
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:37,952
Stop! Stop!

1164
01:22:38,621 --> 01:22:40,038
We need your car. All right?

1165
01:22:40,331 --> 01:22:42,832
- Get out the car.
- Can't you get a better car than that?

1166
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,001
Let that man go!

1167
01:22:45,294 --> 01:22:48,004
- Don't be coming at me with that tone.
- Freak.

1168
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:51,466
- Small cars don't hurt the ozone layer.
- That's what I'm talking about.

1169
01:22:51,675 --> 01:22:53,426
- Stop the car.
- Get Yeah.

1170
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:56,471
- Pop the trunk. Get out. Get in.
- Get out. Get out.

1171
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,723
- Get your ass in.
- Okay.

1172
01:22:59,266 --> 01:23:01,934
- I am in the middle of a sale.
- Do I have to pull my gun?

1173
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:05,897
Oh, shit. Dan Marino. What's up?
Back up, Dan. Hey, you're the truth.

1174
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:08,316
- Whatever you need, officers.
- That's Dan Marino.

1175
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:11,027
- Hey. Back up.
- Let me know how it rides.

1176
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:13,446
He's gonna test-drive the shit out this.

1177
01:23:13,656 --> 01:23:15,323
Go. I don't wanna blow my cover.

1178
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:22,080
Got them. Got them right there.

1179
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:37,970
Why you gotta get so close?

1180
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:41,015
- I won't let that coffin get away.
- But they're all around us.

1181
01:23:41,225 --> 01:23:42,725
Shit, those are the gangbangers.

1182
01:23:42,935 --> 01:23:44,811
Relax, they don't know us.

1183
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:47,939
Boss, we got a problem here.
We're being followed.

1184
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:50,650
This is a big problem, Carlos.

1185
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:56,114
- Sorry, boss. I'll take care of it, okay?
- Kill those black bitches. All right?

1186
01:23:56,407 --> 01:23:58,783
They made us. Get some
undercovers to roll with us.

1187
01:23:59,243 --> 01:24:02,578
We're splitting up. Everybody
go to Third and Boxter, now!

1188
01:24:05,666 --> 01:24:06,708
Here we go.

1189
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:19,762
I didn't sign up for no
goddamned car chase!

1190
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,610
Have you lost your mind?

1191
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:42,952
I see you got your mind set on doing
dumb shit, so please let me out!

1192
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:54,672
I seen this in a movie once.
They didn't make it!

1193
01:24:55,716 --> 01:24:56,716
Mike.

1194
01:24:57,968 --> 01:24:59,010
Oh, shit!

1195
01:25:07,728 --> 01:25:08,978
- Dump truck!
- I got it.

1196
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:12,815
- Mike!
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

1197
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:17,361
Mike, whoa.

1198
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:19,405
Right there! Oh, shit, Mike!

1199
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:21,657
- Did you see that shit?
- No shit.

1200
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:32,668
Dan Marino should definitely
buy this car.

1201
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:37,298
Not this one. I'm fucking this one up.
But definitely one like this.

1202
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:40,426
I almost missed that.

1203
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:45,181
All right, that was almost fucked up.
I almost fucked up.

1204
01:25:47,518 --> 01:25:48,684
Shit!

1205
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:51,646
This is not necessary.

1206
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:02,698
Oh, shit!

1207
01:26:06,453 --> 01:26:08,871
- Damn!
- Dead man on the hood! Dead man!

1208
01:26:09,081 --> 01:26:10,748
- I'm trying to get it off.
- Get it off!

1209
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:12,124
I'm trying to get it off.

1210
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:16,170
- That shit's nasty. That's nasty.
- Get it off! Get

1211
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:17,839
That shit is nasty.

1212
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,987
- Undercover police! Move!
- Undercover police!

1213
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,823
- Move!
- Move! Move! Move!

1214
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:56,127
Coming around the corner!

1215
01:26:56,503 --> 01:26:58,921
Get ready, they're coming
around the block. Move!

1216
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:15,855
Up top!

1217
01:27:23,614 --> 01:27:24,739
Shit!

1218
01:27:24,948 --> 01:27:27,700
Boy, if this was my car, I'd be pissed!

1219
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:29,577
Get down! Get down!

1220
01:27:34,416 --> 01:27:37,126
Trying to break the world record
for gun fights in a week?

1221
01:27:37,336 --> 01:27:39,378
This is not the time to criticise!

1222
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,756
I can't work with you
blaming me all the time!

1223
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:45,426
- This is not your fault?
- This is not No! No!

1224
01:27:45,636 --> 01:27:48,429
Bullshit, Mike! Everything's your fault!

1225
01:27:56,939 --> 01:27:58,439
Okay, let's go! Let's go!

1226
01:28:07,449 --> 01:28:09,325
- Clear room!
- Cool!

1227
01:28:14,206 --> 01:28:15,498
I'm going around!

1228
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:22,004
- Mike, got him!
- They got the coffin.

1229
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:35,017
Move!

1230
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,812
Move! Move! Get down! Police! Get down!

1231
01:28:44,194 --> 01:28:45,236
Move! Move!

1232
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:48,197
Police! Move! Move!

1233
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:50,032
Get out of my way! Move! Move!

1234
01:28:50,242 --> 01:28:51,659
Get down! Get down!

1235
01:28:57,165 --> 01:29:00,167
Shit! Open the door! Police!

1236
01:29:01,378 --> 01:29:02,712
No!

1237
01:29:04,089 --> 01:29:05,423
Whoa! Shit!

1238
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:08,718
Mike! Mike!

1239
01:29:22,566 --> 01:29:24,108
That boy bit me!

1240
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,655
Mike!

1241
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:46,547
Move! Move!

1242
01:29:49,426 --> 01:29:50,885
Police! Move!

1243
01:30:06,902 --> 01:30:08,360
Police! Move!

1244
01:30:12,157 --> 01:30:13,866
He under there?

1245
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,744
We lost the coffin...

1246
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:19,830
and you barbecued our only lead, Mike.

1247
01:30:20,207 --> 01:30:24,126
This has got to be the worst, most
emotional cop-week of my life.

1248
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:26,879
Yeah, it's been a little rough.

1249
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:36,597
- Where were these bodies going?
- I don't know. It's really strange.

1250
01:30:36,807 --> 01:30:38,891
All the John Does we found
out here are empty.

1251
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:41,685
Empty Does. Fat Does.

1252
01:30:41,895 --> 01:30:44,897
Cut them open, took the organs out.
Sewed them back up.

1253
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:47,191
Nice work.

1254
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,277
The more you guys fuck up,
the more we look like rock stars.

1255
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:53,114
The van you was chasing
is a transport for the city morgue.

1256
01:30:53,323 --> 01:30:57,118
The John Does were being delivered
to the university for medical research.

1257
01:30:57,327 --> 01:30:59,537
- Nice going.
- I can't believe you guys.

1258
01:30:59,746 --> 01:31:02,373
Do you both wake up
in the morning, call each other up?

1259
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:04,291
"Good morning, Marcus." "Morning, Mike."

1260
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:05,793
"How you doing?" "A'ight."

1261
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:08,921
"So how are we gonna fuck up
the captain's life today?"

1262
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:10,756
"Gee, I don't know." "I don't know."

1263
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:13,092
"Ooh. Look, over there.

1264
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:16,053
Let's kill three fat people...

1265
01:31:16,263 --> 01:31:18,389
and leave them on the street."

1266
01:31:18,598 --> 01:31:20,391
They were dead before we ran over them.

1267
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:24,603
It doesn't matter whether they
were dead or not, goddamn it!

1268
01:31:24,855 --> 01:31:27,731
Every time you leave a corpse
on the street...

1269
01:31:27,941 --> 01:31:32,987
I have to get these forensic coroner
guys to come to see what happened.

1270
01:31:33,196 --> 01:31:36,824
Then I gotta get detectives.
See? They're detecting shit.

1271
01:31:37,033 --> 01:31:42,246
Then I gotta get these forensic guys
to stick them back in the fucking bag!

1272
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:44,623
Jesus Christ!

1273
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:46,876
You guys, you're like...

1274
01:31:47,294 --> 01:31:50,546
You're like a bunch
of bloodsucking ticks...

1275
01:31:50,881 --> 01:31:54,049
draining the life's blood
out of this department.

1276
01:31:55,594 --> 01:31:57,970
Damn the "whoosah," captain.
Did you just call me a tick?

1277
01:31:58,180 --> 01:31:59,346
I was referring to him.

1278
01:31:59,556 --> 01:32:01,348
- Thought so.
- These aren't normal corpses.

1279
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:04,685
If I threw you out
of a speeding ice truck...

1280
01:32:04,895 --> 01:32:07,938
and then ran over your head,
you wouldn't be normal either.

1281
01:32:08,148 --> 01:32:11,108
Think about this for a second.
These bodies have been emptied...

1282
01:32:11,318 --> 01:32:14,361
from a drug smuggler that just
happens to own a mortuary.

1283
01:32:14,571 --> 01:32:17,406
I got a bunch of bodies waiting
with plenty of room in them...

1284
01:32:17,616 --> 01:32:19,116
I could smuggle some shit.

1285
01:32:19,326 --> 01:32:21,911
Johnny Tapia has the perfect cover.

1286
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:24,371
Johnny Tapia?

1287
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:27,041
I want a warrant to go
into his mortuaries immediately.

1288
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:29,126
No warrant. What? For what? For what?

1289
01:32:29,336 --> 01:32:32,046
For a bunch of dead guys
on their way to med research?

1290
01:32:32,255 --> 01:32:37,092
No. Every time we go after him,
he sues us and wins.

1291
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:41,388
This shit stops now,
or they'll fire us, disband TNT...

1292
01:32:41,598 --> 01:32:43,557
and stick me in a fucking coffin.

1293
01:32:43,767 --> 01:32:46,894
- This is over now!
- What happened to "whatever it takes"?

1294
01:32:47,103 --> 01:32:51,065
That was pre-vehicular manslaughter.
Not to mention Johnny Tapia

1295
01:32:51,274 --> 01:32:53,692
- What the fuck is that?
- Oh, shit.

1296
01:32:58,031 --> 01:33:01,575
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

1297
01:33:01,785 --> 01:33:04,245
This man has violated my rights!

1298
01:33:04,454 --> 01:33:05,829
Who the fuck is that?

1299
01:33:06,206 --> 01:33:09,917
Running people over is not enough
for you? Now you're into kidnapping?

1300
01:33:10,126 --> 01:33:12,419
That man is a criminal. Okay?
We busted him at the

1301
01:33:12,629 --> 01:33:14,755
Excuse me, I have so much brass
up my ass...

1302
01:33:14,965 --> 01:33:17,383
I could be playing
"The Star-Spangled Banner."

1303
01:33:18,969 --> 01:33:20,761
I ain't cut out for this, man.

1304
01:33:21,137 --> 01:33:23,264
Come on, man. I can't do this
with you right now.

1305
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:27,476
- I'm re-evaluating what's important.
- About what? Being a cop?

1306
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:29,478
No, about you being my partner.

1307
01:33:29,729 --> 01:33:32,773
Is this about Syd? God! Hey, Marcus, man

1308
01:33:32,983 --> 01:33:35,859
That was messed up, but that
ain't what this is about, Mike.

1309
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:39,947
Once we nail Tapia,
you and me, we're over.

1310
01:33:40,156 --> 01:33:42,157
I already signed my transfer papers.

1311
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:52,501
Megan, what's the name of this boy
taking you to the movies?

1312
01:33:52,711 --> 01:33:53,794
Reggie.

1313
01:33:54,004 --> 01:33:57,131
Daddy, please don't embarrass me
and ask him a lot of questions.

1314
01:33:57,340 --> 01:34:00,050
Everybody knows you're a cop,
and it makes people nervous.

1315
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:02,845
Well, why nervous? He on crack?

1316
01:34:05,849 --> 01:34:08,475
- It's cool?
- Yeah. Come in.

1317
01:34:08,685 --> 01:34:10,185
What'd you?

1318
01:34:10,770 --> 01:34:12,229
I got a sneak and peek.

1319
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:15,149
Judge Sinclair said we can go
into the mortuary tonight.

1320
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:17,526
We can't touch nothing,
but if we find something...

1321
01:34:17,736 --> 01:34:19,361
he'll give us a righteous warrant.

1322
01:34:19,571 --> 01:34:21,780
You love pissing Captain Howard off,
don't you?

1323
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:23,532
It's what I do.

1324
01:34:24,242 --> 01:34:26,368
So when you start playing golf?

1325
01:34:27,037 --> 01:34:30,998
Hey, so you real serious about
this transfer thing, huh?

1326
01:34:31,207 --> 01:34:34,752
I mean, you been quitting for 10 years.
I just always thought it was...

1327
01:34:34,961 --> 01:34:36,545
how you dealt with all this shit.

1328
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,506
It's what's best for me and my family.

1329
01:34:42,302 --> 01:34:44,386
Look, I'm gonna get my stuff, man.

1330
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:10,329
"We ride together, we die together.

1331
01:35:10,789 --> 01:35:12,456
Bad boys for life."

1332
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:14,750
We getting old, Mike.

1333
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:18,420
One of them young punks coming
to take my baby out on her first date.

1334
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:25,427
- Who the fuck are you?
- Hi, Mr. Burnett. I'm Reggie.

1335
01:35:26,096 --> 01:35:28,222
- What you doing here?
- I came to take out Megan.

1336
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:30,724
- What?
- I came to take out Megan.

1337
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:32,893
- How old are you?
- I'm 15, Mr. Burnett.

1338
01:35:33,103 --> 01:35:34,812
Motherfucker, you look 30.

1339
01:35:35,647 --> 01:35:37,564
- Show me some ID.
- I don't have none on me.

1340
01:35:37,774 --> 01:35:40,734
You don't have no ID.
Get your ass up against that wall.

1341
01:35:40,944 --> 01:35:42,069
What is your problem?

1342
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:45,072
You think you know it all.
Little young Thundercats.

1343
01:35:45,281 --> 01:35:46,407
- Got joints on you?
- No.

1344
01:35:46,616 --> 01:35:48,117
- You smoke that shit?
- No, sir.

1345
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:50,911
You trying to get my daughter high?
Do you smoke that shit?

1346
01:35:51,121 --> 01:35:53,122
- Nigga, who that is at the door?
- It's Reggie.

1347
01:35:53,498 --> 01:35:56,542
- Who the fuck is Reggie?
- Came to take Megan out.

1348
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:00,254
- What you want, nigga?
- I'm here to take his daughter out.

1349
01:36:00,463 --> 01:36:01,755
- What's your name?
- Reggie.

1350
01:36:01,965 --> 01:36:03,924
I heard the motherfucker
say your name Reggie.

1351
01:36:04,134 --> 01:36:05,217
You taking Megan out?

1352
01:36:05,427 --> 01:36:06,802
- How old is you?
- Fifteen.

1353
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:09,096
- Shit, nigga, you at least 30.
- This is Mike.

1354
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:10,597
- Can you fight?
- Yeah.

1355
01:36:10,807 --> 01:36:13,851
You can fight? Motherfucker.
You can't fight. Look at you

1356
01:36:14,060 --> 01:36:15,936
- Cut it out.
- I wanna know if

1357
01:36:16,146 --> 01:36:19,106
When somebody taking my niece out,
I wanna know if he can fight.

1358
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:22,443
Somebody might come say something,
the nigga can't fight, she can't go.

1359
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:25,320
This is Megan's godfather, okay?
He just got out the joint.

1360
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:27,948
Why you putting all my business
in the street?

1361
01:36:28,158 --> 01:36:31,201
- They call him
- I got out of jail. I ain't going back!

1362
01:36:31,411 --> 01:36:32,619
I ain't going back!

1363
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:36,123
What's wrong with you? Acting scared.
You ain't seen a gun before?

1364
01:36:36,332 --> 01:36:37,791
Stop pointing the gun at the boy.

1365
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,627
Look, don't you disrespect me
in front of company.

1366
01:36:40,837 --> 01:36:41,962
Let the gun go off.

1367
01:36:42,172 --> 01:36:45,716
Nigga, you a big, tall, Ludacris-looking
motherfucker, ain't you?

1368
01:36:45,925 --> 01:36:46,967
- You rap?
- No.

1369
01:36:52,765 --> 01:36:53,891
Hey, Mike!

1370
01:36:54,517 --> 01:36:57,227
Now, listen.
Have my daughter home at 10:01.

1371
01:36:57,437 --> 01:37:00,397
If she ain't home at 10:01,
I'm in the car, okay?

1372
01:37:00,607 --> 01:37:03,650
Lock, loaded and hunting
your motherfucking ass down.

1373
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:06,069
- Do you hear me? Speak up.
- I'll go with him.

1374
01:37:06,279 --> 01:37:09,239
If I'm there, know what it'll be?
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, nigga.

1375
01:37:09,449 --> 01:37:11,033
- That's what it'll be.
- Marcus!

1376
01:37:11,242 --> 01:37:15,287
Reggie, baby, I am so sorry.
Forgive Megan's dad and his silly friend.

1377
01:37:15,538 --> 01:37:16,663
- You a virgin?
- Yes.

1378
01:37:16,873 --> 01:37:19,208
Keep it that way.
Ain't gonna be no fucking tonight.

1379
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:22,169
Baby, the red shirt's nice.
You guys have a good time.

1380
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:24,129
- You ever made love to a man?
- No.

1381
01:37:24,422 --> 01:37:26,048
- You want to?
- No, sir.

1382
01:37:26,382 --> 01:37:28,759
- Hey, have a good time, baby.
- Go. Go.

1383
01:37:28,968 --> 01:37:31,261
- All right.
- I need to go.

1384
01:37:31,846 --> 01:37:33,430
That was cool.

1385
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:35,724
So, you ready to bust this case open?

1386
01:37:35,934 --> 01:37:38,227
Oh, yeah. Let's finish strong.
All right?

1387
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:52,199
All right, ladies. We cannot take
a burn tonight or Tapia walks.

1388
01:37:52,408 --> 01:37:54,743
I need a good, clean break-in.

1389
01:37:55,245 --> 01:37:58,080
- Zank, eyeball.
- Eyeball set.

1390
01:37:58,289 --> 01:38:00,707
- Dex, high ground.
- Rooftop set.

1391
01:38:00,917 --> 01:38:03,418
- Fanuti, light your crack pipe.
- Got you.

1392
01:38:03,836 --> 01:38:04,920
Lockman, you buzzing?

1393
01:38:06,172 --> 01:38:07,214
We're up, baby.

1394
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:20,018
- Hello, anybody home?
- We got a stiff to deliver!

1395
01:38:23,106 --> 01:38:26,066
- What's going on here, man?
- We got a stiff to deliver.

1396
01:38:26,276 --> 01:38:29,444
- Nobody told me about any stiff.
- The guy's in the van now. He's fresh.

1397
01:38:29,654 --> 01:38:30,946
No deliveries tonight.

1398
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:39,371
They told us to come right over
to the place. This is the place.

1399
01:38:40,498 --> 01:38:43,000
- We must bring him in here. I'm sorry.
- No one in.

1400
01:38:43,209 --> 01:38:45,586
- You get that body to the morgue yet?
- Morgue?

1401
01:38:45,795 --> 01:38:48,088
You said to get it to
the Spanish Palms Mortuary.

1402
01:38:48,298 --> 01:38:49,756
No, you dumb Latin fuck.

1403
01:38:49,966 --> 01:38:51,592
What you smoking in that crack pipe?

1404
01:38:51,801 --> 01:38:53,468
Who you calling a Latin fuck, man?

1405
01:38:57,515 --> 01:38:58,932
Check.

1406
01:38:59,142 --> 01:39:01,143
There's burnt people down here, Mike.

1407
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:04,354
Oh, fuck.

1408
01:39:06,566 --> 01:39:08,650
Damn, somebody's teeth.

1409
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:11,528
Now that we're here, you need
to sign some paperwork...

1410
01:39:11,738 --> 01:39:15,532
because the man is very contagious.
His contagiousness could touch you.

1411
01:39:15,742 --> 01:39:17,618
You guys have a nice evening.
Good night.

1412
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:20,495
Might you see us inside
for some hot cocoa?

1413
01:39:47,565 --> 01:39:51,276
Cam 1, I got a good signal.
Cam 2, I got a good signal.

1414
01:40:06,042 --> 01:40:08,585
- Damn!
- Stop it. Do not do that tonight.

1415
01:40:08,795 --> 01:40:10,837
- You don't smell that?
- Oh, yeah, I smell it.

1416
01:40:11,047 --> 01:40:12,756
- It stinks.
- Stop!

1417
01:40:14,717 --> 01:40:16,885
I'm gonna have some Pepto.

1418
01:40:25,144 --> 01:40:28,021
- This dude hasn't been embalmed yet.
- What you talking about?

1419
01:40:28,231 --> 01:40:32,567
They stick a tube down your throat
and just suck out all the gunk and bile.

1420
01:40:32,777 --> 01:40:36,196
Because what happens is, your body will
get gaseous, and you'll decompose.

1421
01:40:36,406 --> 01:40:38,699
Don't want that to happen
before your family see you.

1422
01:40:38,908 --> 01:40:41,743
- I don't need to know that now.
- They sew your mouth closed.

1423
01:40:41,953 --> 01:40:45,122
They got to get it all out because
a lot of times, dead people will fart.

1424
01:40:45,623 --> 01:40:47,624
That shit will clear a funeral home out.

1425
01:40:47,834 --> 01:40:49,167
How do you know all that?

1426
01:40:49,377 --> 01:40:51,670
Learning Channel, man. That shit got me.

1427
01:40:54,757 --> 01:40:56,258
Oh, shit.

1428
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:03,557
You're not even gonna warm up to it?

1429
01:41:03,766 --> 01:41:06,101
Hey! Do some cop work.

1430
01:41:06,477 --> 01:41:09,187
- He's a human being.
- Check the casket.

1431
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:12,149
Why don't you check his spine
while you're in there.

1432
01:41:14,944 --> 01:41:16,153
I'm retching.

1433
01:41:22,285 --> 01:41:23,493
Mike!

1434
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:25,620
- What?
- Have some dignity.

1435
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:27,956
- I ain't doing nothing.
- Cover her titties up.

1436
01:41:28,166 --> 01:41:31,835
Like, what am I gonna do
with these big-ass dead titties?

1437
01:41:32,044 --> 01:41:33,336
But you're looking, though.

1438
01:41:33,546 --> 01:41:35,922
There's
Something's wrong with your brain.

1439
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:37,299
Just cover the titties.

1440
01:41:37,717 --> 01:41:39,718
Goddamn!

1441
01:41:41,137 --> 01:41:43,847
Damn. This nicer than some cribs.

1442
01:41:44,474 --> 01:41:46,224
She's going to Cuba.

1443
01:41:49,812 --> 01:41:52,022
Who's top cop now, huh?

1444
01:41:52,231 --> 01:41:54,483
That's what I'm talking about. See?
There you go.

1445
01:41:54,984 --> 01:41:58,236
That's it right there. Take a picture
of the money, then check this body.

1446
01:41:59,238 --> 01:42:01,239
No, I'm gonna count these. You know?

1447
01:42:01,449 --> 01:42:02,449
Check the body.

1448
01:42:02,658 --> 01:42:06,495
I'm gonna check the body, Mike.
I'm not rushing into it, that's all.

1449
01:42:08,164 --> 01:42:10,332
This one's going to a mortuary in L.A.

1450
01:42:12,001 --> 01:42:14,503
I'm gonna check this one.

1451
01:42:37,693 --> 01:42:40,153
That's that bullshit
that I be talking about.

1452
01:42:40,363 --> 01:42:42,531
Mike, the motherfucking head fell off.

1453
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:44,574
Come here.

1454
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:49,162
I'm back in the game.

1455
01:42:52,792 --> 01:42:54,376
Think I got something.

1456
01:42:55,711 --> 01:42:57,045
Feels like a bag.

1457
01:42:58,214 --> 01:42:59,714
Shit, it's his kidney.

1458
01:43:09,267 --> 01:43:11,142
I smell dead people.

1459
01:43:11,727 --> 01:43:14,312
Drugs and money. We got him, baby.

1460
01:43:24,574 --> 01:43:25,907
This dude is loaded.

1461
01:43:26,492 --> 01:43:30,495
Bet he thinks he's a damn genius,
transporting them in dead bodies.

1462
01:43:31,497 --> 01:43:32,956
Let's get this body.

1463
01:43:35,084 --> 01:43:36,710
Mike, you got company, man.

1464
01:43:36,919 --> 01:43:39,921
Somebody's coming. Hide!
Give me the X. Give me the X.

1465
01:43:42,508 --> 01:43:44,134
You gotta stall them.
You gotta stall them.

1466
01:43:50,099 --> 01:43:51,766
Hide! Hide! Hide!

1467
01:43:52,143 --> 01:43:53,184
Shit!

1468
01:43:53,436 --> 01:43:55,687
Punk kids do this? Go check it out.

1469
01:43:55,897 --> 01:43:56,938
Hide!

1470
01:44:00,860 --> 01:44:04,863
Marcus! Why would you?
That's just not smart, man.

1471
01:44:09,118 --> 01:44:11,286
You tell Theresa, I'll kill you.

1472
01:44:17,126 --> 01:44:18,668
Bimbo's next.

1473
01:44:19,128 --> 01:44:22,213
Oh, God. Not that. Not the bimbo.

1474
01:44:23,633 --> 01:44:25,634
Let's hurry this shit up.

1475
01:44:35,478 --> 01:44:37,145
Shit.

1476
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:39,439
We got a big problem.
We got a big problem.

1477
01:44:39,649 --> 01:44:41,775
Drive that ambulance
into the building right now.

1478
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:45,320
- Crash it into the building!
- No. Not me, baby.

1479
01:44:45,529 --> 01:44:47,530
I got too many crashes on my file.
You do it.

1480
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:50,951
No. You're kidding. I got red-flagged
last month for the thing.

1481
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,579
You know how much the city paid.
I can't have another ding on my file.

1482
01:44:56,207 --> 01:44:59,125
Mike, my man, we wanna help
you out here, you know...

1483
01:44:59,335 --> 01:45:02,629
but we got a couple of administration
problems over here, you know?

1484
01:45:02,838 --> 01:45:05,382
So how about we give sirens
and some flashing lights?

1485
01:45:05,591 --> 01:45:06,841
Make a racket. How's that?

1486
01:45:07,843 --> 01:45:09,469
Negative! Negative!

1487
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:11,846
Crash that ambulance
into the building right now!

1488
01:45:12,181 --> 01:45:14,641
We wanna help the team out
and everything, but...

1489
01:45:14,850 --> 01:45:16,643
But I'm not getting suspended for this.

1490
01:45:16,852 --> 01:45:20,981
Okay, I plan on whupping y'all
asses the second I get out of here.

1491
01:45:21,190 --> 01:45:23,566
- Crash into the building right now!
- Screw it.

1492
01:45:23,776 --> 01:45:25,360
Just the price of cop business.

1493
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:27,529
Now, get her on the table.

1494
01:45:38,207 --> 01:45:39,666
Oh, my God.

1495
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:45,422
Jeez! What the hell! I'm so I'm so

1496
01:45:45,715 --> 01:45:46,798
That's tragic, man.

1497
01:45:47,091 --> 01:45:48,800
Go, go, go. Back door's clear. Go! Go!

1498
01:45:49,301 --> 01:45:50,844
Get up, Marcus!

1499
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:53,638
The gas got stuck. I didn't mean to.

1500
01:46:00,396 --> 01:46:01,980
Oh, man.

1501
01:46:04,150 --> 01:46:06,151
Supple leather, you know.

1502
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:09,821
You ever rub your leather?

1503
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:13,241
You know, like, just rub it.
See how good it feels.

1504
01:46:16,746 --> 01:46:19,122
What does love mean to you, Mike?

1505
01:46:19,790 --> 01:46:22,250
Don't worry about me and my love.

1506
01:46:23,294 --> 01:46:25,837
Look, I got plenty of love in my life.

1507
01:46:27,006 --> 01:46:28,840
Like a woman's butt.

1508
01:46:29,133 --> 01:46:31,843
- Don't do that.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Mike.

1509
01:46:32,094 --> 01:46:34,054
Let's just concentrate
and get this warrant.

1510
01:46:34,346 --> 01:46:35,805
I need to express right now.

1511
01:46:36,098 --> 01:46:40,018
I want you to know, if this is
our last job, I really appreciate you.

1512
01:46:40,269 --> 01:46:41,352
Okay?

1513
01:46:41,604 --> 01:46:42,687
No, this is not gay shit.

1514
01:46:42,938 --> 01:46:45,482
This is man shit. You know what I mean?

1515
01:46:45,775 --> 01:46:47,901
And you a beautiful man. You know?

1516
01:46:48,194 --> 01:46:50,445
And when you let the beautiful side

1517
01:46:51,947 --> 01:46:53,740
- What?
- Look at your pupils.

1518
01:46:54,033 --> 01:46:56,034
How am I look at my pupil? What, I'm

1519
01:46:56,786 --> 01:46:59,704
Yo, what are you taking?
Did you take some of that X?

1520
01:47:00,289 --> 01:47:03,333
- Hey, look, give me a hug.
- Hey, get off. Listen, listen. Listen!

1521
01:47:03,626 --> 01:47:07,337
We need this warrant. Do not
fuck this up. Pull yourself together.

1522
01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:15,220
Evening, captain.

1523
01:47:15,471 --> 01:47:17,055
Hello...

1524
01:47:17,306 --> 01:47:18,723
"captain."

1525
01:47:18,974 --> 01:47:21,893
So how do you two plan to fuck up
my evening tonight?

1526
01:47:22,144 --> 01:47:25,396
Well, captain, believe me,
we would not be here...

1527
01:47:25,689 --> 01:47:28,733
if it weren't seriously,
utterly important.

1528
01:47:29,527 --> 01:47:30,735
Get in here.

1529
01:47:31,987 --> 01:47:33,488
Get off me!

1530
01:47:42,665 --> 01:47:46,251
Cap, this is beautiful.

1531
01:47:46,502 --> 01:47:48,711
Have such a warm feel, you know.

1532
01:47:49,004 --> 01:47:52,048
Sort of like a "ving shwa."
What's it, Mike?

1533
01:47:52,341 --> 01:47:56,094
- It was a V, like a "von schwo."
- Why don't you have a seat?

1534
01:47:56,387 --> 01:47:59,264
- Or "ven wangs" or
- Feng shui.

1535
01:47:59,515 --> 01:48:00,932
"Von sway."

1536
01:48:01,517 --> 01:48:03,768
You have a "von sway" home.

1537
01:48:04,061 --> 01:48:05,311
Make yourself at home.

1538
01:48:05,604 --> 01:48:08,481
All right, captain, I know you said
that Johnny Tapia was hands

1539
01:48:08,774 --> 01:48:11,401
- Oh, no! No!
- Look, captain, we got him. It's a wrap.

1540
01:48:11,694 --> 01:48:14,988
Look, we messed up today,
but we got him. Please just look.

1541
01:48:15,281 --> 01:48:18,283
- How do I move it?
- Here, you flip through the pictures.

1542
01:48:19,368 --> 01:48:21,452
You can flip
You can flip through picture

1543
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:23,288
This is horrible.

1544
01:48:28,711 --> 01:48:31,337
- Take the picture.
- You can look really close.

1545
01:48:31,589 --> 01:48:34,048
Listen, we got everything
that we need to take this dude.

1546
01:48:34,884 --> 01:48:36,301
Oh, God.

1547
01:48:36,927 --> 01:48:38,845
They're taking the organs out.

1548
01:48:39,096 --> 01:48:42,473
Right there you can You can
Yeah. If you look there...

1549
01:48:42,892 --> 01:48:44,392
Oh, gosh.

1550
01:48:48,063 --> 01:48:50,440
This is good. That's horrible.

1551
01:48:52,401 --> 01:48:53,818
Look at this.

1552
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:57,488
Everybody just needs to relax.

1553
01:48:59,158 --> 01:49:02,660
What are you doing? Marcus,
it's 2 a.m. Get your hands off me.

1554
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:07,874
Remember we said we
were gonna call Vargas and Reyes?

1555
01:49:08,167 --> 01:49:10,501
- No, I don't
- Call Vargas!

1556
01:49:11,045 --> 01:49:13,338
Tell him the thing we said to tell him.

1557
01:49:14,006 --> 01:49:16,716
- What thing?
- Tell him we said About yesterday.

1558
01:49:17,509 --> 01:49:19,010
And tell him about the thing.

1559
01:49:19,220 --> 01:49:21,930
So, captain, listen,
we've also got videotape.

1560
01:49:22,181 --> 01:49:24,724
Yesterday, we fucked up bad.
But we got him now.

1561
01:49:25,517 --> 01:49:26,684
Oh, shit.

1562
01:49:27,102 --> 01:49:28,770
- What?
- No, a lot of times with these

1563
01:49:29,063 --> 01:49:30,104
Oh, shit!

1564
01:49:30,522 --> 01:49:32,440
- What? Did I erase it?
- No. We got video.

1565
01:49:32,650 --> 01:49:35,360
- We got fucking...
- Oh. Let me see.

1566
01:49:36,946 --> 01:49:37,987
Oh, shit.

1567
01:49:38,447 --> 01:49:40,740
He's shipping the drugs around
the country in bodies.

1568
01:49:40,991 --> 01:49:42,951
We found coffins of cash,
tagged for Cuba.

1569
01:49:43,202 --> 01:49:45,912
And you think Tapia's about
to move out with all this money?

1570
01:49:46,455 --> 01:49:49,082
I love it when you call me Bunny Nose.

1571
01:49:49,333 --> 01:49:50,750
Shit!

1572
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,335
Yeah, I do, girl.

1573
01:49:52,544 --> 01:49:54,712
You should see this sexy shit I got on.

1574
01:49:54,964 --> 01:49:56,714
Who the hell are you talking to?

1575
01:49:56,966 --> 01:49:59,759
I talked to Vargas and...

1576
01:50:00,552 --> 01:50:04,931
Ru Reyes. They said that
they down for whatever.

1577
01:50:05,182 --> 01:50:07,767
This is a nice fish, you know.

1578
01:50:07,977 --> 01:50:11,396
Big fucking eyes,
but a nice fucking fish.

1579
01:50:11,981 --> 01:50:13,773
We need this warrant, captain.

1580
01:50:14,066 --> 01:50:15,775
Let's take this scumbag down.

1581
01:50:21,991 --> 01:50:23,741
What the fuck is going on?

1582
01:50:24,868 --> 01:50:28,997
- He ingested X.
- You okay, pal? Take it easy.

1583
01:50:30,165 --> 01:50:31,499
Okay, thank you.

1584
01:50:31,709 --> 01:50:33,876
Poison lady says we gotta keep him cool.

1585
01:50:34,128 --> 01:50:36,879
Otherwise, he's burning up,
he can get brain damage.

1586
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:38,840
Nobody will even notice that.

1587
01:50:43,762 --> 01:50:45,305
Mike, I got an erection.

1588
01:50:48,058 --> 01:50:49,684
- Take me home.
- Hey.

1589
01:50:50,269 --> 01:50:53,730
Call the wife, tell her I'm on the way.

1590
01:51:03,782 --> 01:51:05,825
Hope you guys hear me.

1591
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:11,289
- We got her. Loud and clear.
- She's in.

1592
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:12,999
Showtime.

1593
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:15,293
Palm Mortuary, Alpha team.

01:51:15,544 --> 01:51:18,796
Tapia's mansion, Delta.
Dixie Boy boat dock, Bravo.

1595
01:51:19,048 --> 01:51:21,883
Coast Guard gunships,
anything that hits the water.

1596
01:51:22,092 --> 01:51:23,885
We hit all three places simultaneously.

1597
01:51:24,511 --> 01:51:28,973
Tac up at 08:45.
We go hot at 09:00 sharp.

1598
01:51:29,183 --> 01:51:30,224
Bring the noise.

1599
01:51:37,983 --> 01:51:41,235
You're such a beautiful girl.

1600
01:51:41,487 --> 01:51:43,071
Thank you.

1601
01:51:43,655 --> 01:51:45,656
- Johnny.
- Yeah?

1602
01:51:45,949 --> 01:51:47,909
- Is she a Negro?
- Please, Mama!

1603
01:51:48,118 --> 01:51:49,494
Shut up! Get out of here!

1604
01:51:50,788 --> 01:51:52,497
You make your bed, you sleep in it!

1605
01:52:00,756 --> 01:52:02,423
Make way!

1606
01:52:03,801 --> 01:52:06,677
- Get down!
- Don't fucking move!

1607
01:52:07,638 --> 01:52:10,681
You take risks. I like that.

1608
01:52:11,225 --> 01:52:12,433
Or...

1609
01:52:15,145 --> 01:52:18,564
maybe I'm the one
taking a risk on you, huh?

1610
01:52:19,316 --> 01:52:20,525
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1611
01:52:23,237 --> 01:52:26,072
Excuse me, boss. We need to talk now.

1612
01:52:26,782 --> 01:52:28,282
Something's going on outside.

1613
01:52:29,743 --> 01:52:31,744
- Cops.
- What the fuck do you mean, cops?

1614
01:52:34,164 --> 01:52:35,623
Goddamn it.

1615
01:52:37,251 --> 01:52:39,669
DEA. You don't plan on entering, do you?

1616
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:44,048
- We have a warrant to get in there.
- A UC's inside. She's gotta leave first.

1617
01:52:44,299 --> 01:52:45,383
You got two minutes.

1618
01:52:45,634 --> 01:52:47,552
- Call her on her cell.
- Yes, sir.

1619
01:52:48,846 --> 01:52:50,638
Cut the power to the house.

1620
01:52:52,349 --> 01:52:54,308
- You got her? Well, let's go.
- No, sir.

1621
01:52:58,814 --> 01:53:00,231
We got a bogey.

1622
01:53:03,986 --> 01:53:08,823
God. This is for you, Josef,
and me and Mother Russia.

1623
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:14,162
They're not gangbanger homeys.
They're cops.

1624
01:53:14,413 --> 01:53:15,580
Cops?

1625
01:53:16,123 --> 01:53:20,418
They weren't trying to hit the load.
I think they were looking after her.

1626
01:53:27,885 --> 01:53:29,093
Now, you tell me...

1627
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:31,929
- where is the wire?
- They made her.

1628
01:53:32,806 --> 01:53:35,099
We gotta get her out. Go! Come on!

1629
01:53:35,684 --> 01:53:39,479
Hey, Tapia, you fucking mother.

1630
01:53:45,319 --> 01:53:47,945
The Russian Grim Reaper is here.

1631
01:53:49,156 --> 01:53:50,823
Everything's in here.

1632
01:53:51,575 --> 01:53:54,368
- Oh, shit.
- Goddamn.

1633
01:53:54,578 --> 01:53:57,413
Eyeball, has anything left this
mortuary in the past two hours?

1634
01:53:57,664 --> 01:54:01,209
A four-hearse funeral just left.
We trailed them to Miami Harbour.

1635
01:54:01,752 --> 01:54:04,962
Miami Air, Tapia's running his
money to Cuba. Get us a chopper!

1636
01:54:11,929 --> 01:54:14,388
Hey, Tapia!

1637
01:54:15,766 --> 01:54:17,892
You scared of me, you little scumbag?

1638
01:54:18,101 --> 01:54:20,561
- We got some heat.
- Pull the car back.

1639
01:54:20,854 --> 01:54:23,856
I'll fucking kill you!
Who the hell are you?

1640
01:54:24,107 --> 01:54:25,983
- Drop the weapon!
- Drop the weapon now!

1641
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:28,903
- I'm with you guys!
- Put it down, now!

1642
01:54:29,112 --> 01:54:30,780
- I'm over here!
- Shut up!

1643
01:54:31,031 --> 01:54:33,699
- Drop the weapon!
- I'll kill that son of a bitch!

1644
01:54:44,294 --> 01:54:47,171
This is Alpha. Heads up to the
Coast Guard Sharks and Bravo Team.

1645
01:54:47,422 --> 01:54:49,549
Close the harbour.
Freeze any moving speedboat.

1646
01:54:49,758 --> 01:54:50,758
This is Bravo.

1647
01:54:50,968 --> 01:54:53,844
We got a go-fast slinging a high rate
of speed down Miami harbour.

1648
01:54:54,096 --> 01:54:55,721
Stop that boat.

1649
01:55:10,904 --> 01:55:12,446
This guy's moving us.

1650
01:55:15,576 --> 01:55:17,535
Think we're going for the bridge.

1651
01:55:47,441 --> 01:55:49,150
Coast Guard, we're going in.

1652
01:55:50,861 --> 01:55:52,653
Miami Police. Shut it down.

1653
01:55:52,946 --> 01:55:55,239
This is the police. Shut it down.

1654
01:56:01,121 --> 01:56:03,331
- Watch out, he got a weapon.
- Bail out!

1655
01:56:07,878 --> 01:56:09,754
Coast Guard, take him down. Burn him.

1656
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:23,184
Vessel is dead in the water.
Vessel is dead in the water.

1657
01:56:26,813 --> 01:56:28,689
This is what we do.

1658
01:56:32,402 --> 01:56:34,862
Oh, man, it's full up. It's full up.

1659
01:56:35,155 --> 01:56:36,781
It's a righteous bust.

1660
01:56:46,708 --> 01:56:48,376
How the hell they slip away?

1661
01:56:49,503 --> 01:56:51,545
Give me the watch commander on the horn.

1662
01:56:51,755 --> 01:56:54,298
Do you know her brother
on Miami P.D.? Find him.

1663
01:56:55,175 --> 01:56:59,387
Do you know anyone
who might want to save your life?

1664
01:57:04,351 --> 01:57:06,644
- Hello?
- Marcus, they!

1665
01:57:06,895 --> 01:57:10,439
You have $100 million of mine...

1666
01:57:10,691 --> 01:57:13,067
and I want it back in 48 hours.

1667
01:57:25,038 --> 01:57:27,039
Shit just got real.

1668
01:57:37,801 --> 01:57:39,677
Jack Snell, DEA.

1669
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:41,512
Agent Eames, FBI...

1670
01:57:41,972 --> 01:57:43,848
who has just informed me...

1671
01:57:44,307 --> 01:57:48,602
that satellite pinpointed Tapia's jet
in Cuban airspace 20 minutes ago.

1672
01:57:48,812 --> 01:57:50,438
Cuba?

1673
01:57:50,647 --> 01:57:53,858
United States does not negotiate
with hostage-takers.

1674
01:57:54,109 --> 01:57:56,068
Especially Cuban hostage-takers.

1675
01:57:56,319 --> 01:57:58,738
It's a delicate situation.

1676
01:57:59,406 --> 01:58:02,825
This is not just a situation.
This is my sister.

1677
01:58:03,076 --> 01:58:05,911
Off the record,
all State Department agencies...

1678
01:58:06,163 --> 01:58:09,081
are using their back-channel
contacts for a diplomatic solution.

1679
01:58:09,332 --> 01:58:12,418
You know, by the time
y'all finish being diplomatic...

1680
01:58:12,669 --> 01:58:16,130
my sister could be in a fucking box.
This is bullshit.

1681
01:58:38,445 --> 01:58:40,821
He ain't getting away from us that easy.

1682
01:58:50,540 --> 01:58:52,166
We ride together...

1683
01:58:53,877 --> 01:58:55,503
we die together.

1684
01:58:57,547 --> 01:58:59,340
Bad boys for life.

1685
01:59:06,348 --> 01:59:08,516
We just gotta do it ourselves, man.

1686
01:59:36,253 --> 01:59:37,545
I don't know you.

1687
01:59:37,754 --> 01:59:40,631
You look like you're about to do
something stupid. I'm in.

1688
01:59:41,424 --> 01:59:44,009
Dodd tell you how
crazy us ex-Delta guys are?

1689
01:59:45,345 --> 01:59:47,096
My brother, Tito, lives in Cuba.

1690
01:59:47,347 --> 01:59:50,391
He's a little crazy, but he's hooked up
with the underground.

1691
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:53,227
Weapons, men, a safe house.
Whatever we need.

1692
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:55,688
You can forget about passports
and all that stuff.

1693
01:59:55,897 --> 01:59:58,816
Because if the Cubans catch us,
we're all dead.

1694
01:59:59,192 --> 02:00:02,862
My brother Tito's in Alpha 66,
the Anti-Castro Underground.

1695
02:00:03,113 --> 02:00:04,738
What does that have to do with Tapia?

1696
02:00:05,448 --> 02:00:08,659
Everything. Tapia's the biggest
supplier of drug cash to Castro.

1697
02:00:08,910 --> 02:00:10,744
So Alpha 66 will be all over him.

1698
02:00:11,037 --> 02:00:15,124
Brother, that is perfect. He says he
can get men on the tunnel right away.

1699
02:00:15,375 --> 02:00:16,542
Let me holler at him.

1700
02:00:17,377 --> 02:00:20,504
Tito, we need layout, security,
the whole deal.

1701
02:00:20,755 --> 02:00:24,675
We got info that Tapia's got a casket
coming in tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.

1702
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:27,845
Yeah, that might be our way in. Yeah.

1703
02:00:28,597 --> 02:00:32,433
Brought you a little care package
from my friends over at the CIA.

1704
02:00:32,726 --> 02:00:35,769
They want to help. And don't ask me.

1705
02:00:36,897 --> 02:00:38,063
They're spies.

1706
02:00:38,398 --> 02:00:42,902
Former Delta Intel and Demo.
Requesting permission to tag along.

1707
02:00:59,669 --> 02:01:02,630
Ronnie, I hear there's a boat
on fire off the coast of Cuba.

1708
02:01:03,173 --> 02:01:05,633
Shouldn't we break
international waters to help them?

1709
02:01:05,926 --> 02:01:06,967
That's my dog.

1710
02:01:11,932 --> 02:01:13,641
Point of no return.

1711
02:01:14,184 --> 02:01:16,560
I wanna thank y'all
from the bottom of my heart.

1712
02:01:18,021 --> 02:01:22,274
- Mike, look, I just
- Tell me when we get back.

1713
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:25,819
The target's in sight. I see the boat.

1714
02:01:26,112 --> 02:01:28,822
Roger. Target 12 o'clock, 300 yards.

1715
02:01:31,409 --> 02:01:33,827
Roper in the door. Stand by.

1716
02:01:37,582 --> 02:01:39,416
Go! Go! Go!

1717
02:01:50,845 --> 02:01:53,639
- Tito?
- Welcome to Cuba.

1718
02:02:11,324 --> 02:02:16,078
Damn. What's up with the safe house
across the street from Tapia's crib?

1719
02:02:16,287 --> 02:02:18,038
This is the last place
anyone would look.

1720
02:02:18,331 --> 02:02:22,167
We've been watching the place.
Guards play soccer each day at 3:30.

1721
02:02:23,086 --> 02:02:27,131
The bad news, everyone knows he
uses the army like his bodyguards.

1722
02:02:28,174 --> 02:02:31,385
- This is Tapia's compound.
- CIA hooked us up, huh?

1723
02:02:31,678 --> 02:02:35,055
Yeah. This LIDAR laser technology
even shows his escape tunnel.

1724
02:02:35,265 --> 02:02:37,808
The alarm security is wired to the army.

1725
02:02:38,059 --> 02:02:41,645
We're screwed if we don't blow up this
security room before we make a move.

1726
02:02:41,896 --> 02:02:43,564
The tunnel we're digging branches off.

1727
02:02:43,857 --> 02:02:47,651
One under his back yard
and the other into his escape tunnel.

1728
02:02:48,611 --> 02:02:50,154
We gotta hurry up.

1729
02:02:51,614 --> 02:02:54,992
See? I told you my brother was a maniac.

1730
02:02:56,703 --> 02:02:59,079
- How we looking?
- Let me check it out.

1731
02:03:18,391 --> 02:03:20,476
Papi, you look like Jesus.

1732
02:03:21,227 --> 02:03:23,479
Why they call this The Last Supper?

1733
02:03:23,730 --> 02:03:27,775
It was the last time they were all
together before Jesus was crucified.

1734
02:03:28,651 --> 02:03:30,402
Crucified?

1735
02:03:31,654 --> 02:03:33,906
Hold your ears. Hey, you.

1736
02:03:34,491 --> 02:03:38,535
Listen to me. This is fucking
depressing! You understand?

1737
02:03:38,787 --> 02:03:40,871
I mean, who had this fucking idea?

1738
02:03:41,915 --> 02:03:45,876
I just want little angels
looking down on me.

1739
02:03:46,878 --> 02:03:49,963
Okay, here's the ocean,
300 yards from Tapia's house.

1740
02:03:50,256 --> 02:03:53,801
We're here. Safe house.
First tunnel comes through to here.

1741
02:03:54,052 --> 02:03:56,470
First team takes out
the security station.

1742
02:03:56,763 --> 02:03:59,640
Second tunnel comes through
into the centre of the house.

1743
02:04:00,016 --> 02:04:03,310
Tito, your contacts inside
said Syd's in the last bedroom...

1744
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:04,812
on the second floor, right?

1745
02:04:05,063 --> 02:04:07,648
Lupe's one of us.
If she says your sister's there...

1746
02:04:07,857 --> 02:04:08,857
she is there.

1747
02:04:09,067 --> 02:04:12,694
Three o'clock sharp, the bag of cats
and iguanas go over the fence.

1748
02:04:12,946 --> 02:04:16,198
Hopefully, the motion detectors will go
so crazy, security will shut them off.

1749
02:04:16,533 --> 02:04:19,159
My guys will watch the outside
for any military.

1750
02:04:19,369 --> 02:04:21,328
If they come, that's bad.

1751
02:04:30,713 --> 02:04:32,339
Let's make this count, guys.

1752
02:04:56,281 --> 02:04:57,906
We're in.

1753
02:05:17,177 --> 02:05:20,053
Goddamn it, it's the fifth time today.

1754
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:25,100
Carlos, turn off the motion sensors
till we get it fixed.

1755
02:05:25,435 --> 02:05:27,561
- Look what I found. Can I keep them?
- No.

1756
02:05:27,937 --> 02:05:29,229
All right, guys...

1757
02:05:29,439 --> 02:05:32,566
- sensors are down. Time to move.
- We are 100 percent go.

1758
02:05:33,818 --> 02:05:35,402
Let's go.

1759
02:05:51,377 --> 02:05:54,922
Left. Left. Yeah. There we go.
This is not as easy as it looks.

1760
02:06:14,025 --> 02:06:16,276
Okay, we're at the T. Split right.

1761
02:06:19,197 --> 02:06:20,614
Good luck, guys.

1762
02:06:24,661 --> 02:06:26,787
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

1763
02:06:29,457 --> 02:06:32,918
Find the soccer game.
Sniff it out, baby. Sniff it out.

1764
02:06:38,967 --> 02:06:40,759
To the left. To the left. Oh, shit.

1765
02:06:47,225 --> 02:06:49,268
Oh, you did not see me.

1766
02:06:53,731 --> 02:06:57,150
- Ready to bust into the escape tunnel.
- There we go. Soccer.

1767
02:07:09,664 --> 02:07:10,789
Sorry.

1768
02:07:18,298 --> 02:07:19,923
Go, go, go!

1769
02:07:36,065 --> 02:07:37,566
Go!

1770
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:40,861
Get me the American bitch.

1771
02:07:41,112 --> 02:07:43,405
Call General Santos.
Tell him I need him now!

1772
02:07:44,282 --> 02:07:46,908
Sorry, darling. Take her outside
to safety. Come on.

1773
02:08:05,887 --> 02:08:07,804
- Carlos, this is not good!
- I know!

1774
02:08:08,222 --> 02:08:10,599
- Where is General Santos?
- He's coming, boss!

1775
02:08:17,565 --> 02:08:20,692
You fucking maricons!
I'm gonna blow your head off!

1776
02:08:21,152 --> 02:08:22,527
Fuck!

1777
02:08:22,904 --> 02:08:26,823
What's happened to this gun?
My son will slice you into chorizo.

1778
02:08:27,367 --> 02:08:29,159
- Mama, I'm very sorry.
- You little puta!

1779
02:08:39,003 --> 02:08:41,296
- Vargas, you in?
- We got Mama and the girl.

1780
02:08:41,547 --> 02:08:43,632
We're entering the house. Go!

1781
02:08:58,314 --> 02:08:59,606
Move! Move! Move!

1782
02:09:12,662 --> 02:09:15,789
Everything's clear outside.
You got 30 seconds max. Haul ass.

1783
02:09:20,545 --> 02:09:23,964
You got two rovers on the balcony.
I can't get a shot off.

1784
02:09:26,509 --> 02:09:28,552
See the rover? I missed him!

1785
02:09:34,934 --> 02:09:36,309
Get down! Get down now!

1786
02:09:36,519 --> 02:09:37,644
- Get down!
- Down!

1787
02:09:40,356 --> 02:09:42,315
Move! Move! Move!

1788
02:09:42,733 --> 02:09:44,317
- Marcus!
- Come on!

1789
02:09:44,527 --> 02:09:46,278
Move! We got the package.

1790
02:09:46,529 --> 02:09:48,989
Move now. It's turning
into a real bad day.

1791
02:09:49,240 --> 02:09:52,492
- Vargas, we're coming back. Cover us!
- We got you covered, baby.

1792
02:10:06,382 --> 02:10:08,175
Somebody talk to me. What's going on?

1793
02:10:08,426 --> 02:10:09,759
The military is everywhere.

1794
02:10:17,059 --> 02:10:20,145
- This is bad, I have to go.
- Listen, you have a lot of company.

1795
02:10:20,396 --> 02:10:22,689
Get out of there now!

1796
02:10:30,072 --> 02:10:31,573
I'm hit! I'm hit!

1797
02:10:32,992 --> 02:10:35,410
Head for the tunnel. I'll blow this.

1798
02:10:38,748 --> 02:10:40,540
Go, go! Get out!

1799
02:10:53,930 --> 02:10:55,847
Mike, you gotta get out.

1800
02:10:57,350 --> 02:10:59,601
Vargas! Get out! Abort!

1801
02:10:59,852 --> 02:11:01,853
We won't reach the tunnel! Go to plan B.

1802
02:11:02,104 --> 02:11:03,939
- We're going to plan B!
- What plan B?

1803
02:11:04,190 --> 02:11:05,565
You don't pay attention to shit!

1804
02:11:05,816 --> 02:11:07,567
- What's the plan B?
- That's your problem!

1805
02:11:07,777 --> 02:11:09,694
Are you fucking shitting me? Let's go!

1806
02:11:09,946 --> 02:11:11,446
- Follow me! Follow me!
- I will

1807
02:11:11,697 --> 02:11:14,407
Plan B? What the hell is plan B?

1808
02:11:15,618 --> 02:11:18,870
- Tito, what you doing here?
- You need a Cuban guide, fool.

1809
02:11:19,121 --> 02:11:20,497
This way!

1810
02:11:22,124 --> 02:11:24,793
- They won't make it to the tunnel.
- Let's blow out of here!

1811
02:11:27,838 --> 02:11:29,506
Keys, keys, keys!

1812
02:11:44,730 --> 02:11:47,774
Oh, my God! No! God! Oh, my God!

1813
02:11:51,988 --> 02:11:53,863
Plan B did not have
that big-ass gun in it!

1814
02:11:54,323 --> 02:11:57,826
You call this plan B?
What the plan B stand for? Bullshit!

1815
02:11:58,035 --> 02:11:59,077
Do you wanna drive?

1816
02:11:59,328 --> 02:12:01,746
Yeah, pull over by the fuckers
with the machine guns!

1817
02:12:01,998 --> 02:12:03,290
Shit!

1818
02:12:10,047 --> 02:12:11,715
Yeah.

1819
02:12:12,091 --> 02:12:13,800
I am not to be fucked with!

1820
02:12:16,012 --> 02:12:19,639
I missed the part of the meeting when
you drive through the dining room.

1821
02:12:19,890 --> 02:12:21,683
And right out the front door.

1822
02:12:38,951 --> 02:12:40,410
Get in the truck!

1823
02:12:44,790 --> 02:12:46,041
Cuban army was everywhere.

1824
02:13:02,475 --> 02:13:05,018
- Gotta get us to Guantanamo Bay!
- No.

1825
02:13:05,269 --> 02:13:07,145
You can't drive onto a U.S. Naval base.

1826
02:13:07,396 --> 02:13:08,688
Hey, we're Americans, okay?

1827
02:13:12,401 --> 02:13:15,362
Marcus, you know how when
we usually get in these situations...

1828
02:13:15,571 --> 02:13:19,074
I'm always trying to make you
feel better, like, "We'll be all right."

1829
02:13:19,325 --> 02:13:21,159
- Yeah, yeah.
- I could say it...

1830
02:13:21,369 --> 02:13:23,745
but that'd be a bunch of bullshit today.

1831
02:13:34,090 --> 02:13:35,382
Military, military.

1832
02:13:35,591 --> 02:13:37,717
- Which way?
- No, right! Right! Go right!

1833
02:13:43,265 --> 02:13:45,892
These are drug-dealer shacks.
They make cocaine here.

1834
02:13:46,102 --> 02:13:48,228
Hope there's shit in there
that likes to blow.

1835
02:13:57,321 --> 02:13:59,572
Faster! I'll kill you, motherfucker!

1836
02:13:59,782 --> 02:14:00,907
I'm gonna go for it.

1837
02:14:01,117 --> 02:14:03,118
- This is a big-ass hill.
- Shit.

1838
02:14:11,210 --> 02:14:15,130
- Oh, shit! Is this still called plan B?
- No, this is definitely plan C.

1839
02:14:50,124 --> 02:14:51,166
Oh, Jesus!

1840
02:15:10,686 --> 02:15:12,312
God! God!

1841
02:15:12,521 --> 02:15:14,981
Everybody, start shooting at somebody!

1842
02:15:17,943 --> 02:15:19,444
Shoot! Shoot!

1843
02:15:24,116 --> 02:15:27,035
- Shit! I'm out!
- I got two rounds left.

1844
02:15:27,286 --> 02:15:28,828
- One in the chamber.
- I'm out.

1845
02:15:29,038 --> 02:15:31,331
All these guns,
and none of you got no bullets?

1846
02:15:31,540 --> 02:15:34,709
- I got one in my hip!
- Oh, God, he's hit!

1847
02:15:37,254 --> 02:15:38,546
There! Gitmo!

1848
02:15:40,424 --> 02:15:42,467
U.S. soil, baby. U.S. soil.

1849
02:15:42,676 --> 02:15:43,718
Come on! Go!

1850
02:15:45,304 --> 02:15:48,223
- Americans on the way!
- Whoa, watch

1851
02:15:54,313 --> 02:15:55,688
Run it! Run it!

1852
02:16:11,455 --> 02:16:12,872
Go.

1853
02:16:25,344 --> 02:16:26,886
Go! Go! Go!

1854
02:16:34,979 --> 02:16:36,229
Fuck.

1855
02:16:39,191 --> 02:16:40,275
Mike!

1856
02:16:59,503 --> 02:17:01,296
We're Americans!

1857
02:17:01,547 --> 02:17:04,632
I pay my motherfucking taxes!
Shoot them!

1858
02:17:04,884 --> 02:17:07,260
Hey, fucking gringo. Drop the gun!

1859
02:17:07,469 --> 02:17:10,513
Put it down! Put it down!

1860
02:17:14,643 --> 02:17:18,938
They can't help you.
You're staying in Cuba.

1861
02:17:23,527 --> 02:17:25,945
You are standing on a live minefield!

1862
02:17:26,322 --> 02:17:27,780
Do not move!

1863
02:17:29,533 --> 02:17:32,619
Look, why don't we all go home

1864
02:17:32,870 --> 02:17:35,288
Well, we'll go home, you go to a hotel.

1865
02:17:35,539 --> 02:17:39,459
Work this shit out another day. None of
us is having a good day right now.

1866
02:17:39,710 --> 02:17:40,960
- Give me the gun!
- Okay.

1867
02:17:41,253 --> 02:17:42,962
I'll toss it right at your feet...

1868
02:17:43,172 --> 02:17:45,548
right next to the mine.

1869
02:18:41,397 --> 02:18:43,648
Now, that's how you supposed to shoot!

1870
02:18:43,899 --> 02:18:46,776
From now on, that's how you shoot!

1871
02:18:48,070 --> 02:18:50,863
Oh, I want my next partner
to shoot just like that.

1872
02:18:51,073 --> 02:18:54,534
It take a dysfunctional motherfucker
to bust somebody in the head like that.

1873
02:18:54,743 --> 02:18:56,577
That's some dysfunctional shit.

1874
02:18:56,829 --> 02:18:59,497
My next partner willll invite me
to his barbecues, though.

1875
02:18:59,748 --> 02:19:01,749
Come here, girl. Come here.

1876
02:19:04,086 --> 02:19:06,337
I came all the way to Cuba for this.

1877
02:19:08,841 --> 02:19:10,925
Come on.

1878
02:19:11,176 --> 02:19:14,095
Y'all gotta do that
around the land mines?

1879
02:19:16,974 --> 02:19:20,768
Would you tell them that that shit is
dangerous around these land mines?

1880
02:19:33,490 --> 02:19:37,702
You know, Mike, this ain't easy for me,
but I was wrong.

1881
02:19:37,953 --> 02:19:41,748
I'll be very proud for you
to date my sister.

1882
02:19:41,999 --> 02:19:43,541
- Thanks, man.
- All right.

1883
02:19:44,084 --> 02:19:46,085
You know, me and Syd thought about it...

1884
02:19:46,295 --> 02:19:48,296
and your behaviour was so crazy that...

1885
02:19:48,589 --> 02:19:53,134
any magic we could've captured,
probably best if we didn't... You know.

1886
02:19:53,385 --> 02:19:56,012
You're just gonna take advantage
of my little sister?

1887
02:19:56,263 --> 02:19:57,722
Already, you breaking her heart?

1888
02:19:57,973 --> 02:20:00,349
- What you talking about?
- She not good enough for you?

1889
02:20:00,893 --> 02:20:03,227
Syd, Mike says you ain't shit!

1890
02:20:03,479 --> 02:20:06,355
Now, why would you scream out
some crazy nonsense like that?

1891
02:20:06,607 --> 02:20:11,194
I don't appreciate you coming here,
disrespecting me in my new pool.

1892
02:20:11,445 --> 02:20:12,612
I bought your new pool.

1893
02:20:12,905 --> 02:20:17,617
Why don't you hook this pool up
to your Ferrari and drag it out of here?

1894
02:20:17,910 --> 02:20:19,368
First of all, I was joking.

1895
02:20:19,578 --> 02:20:22,622
And second of all, all this right here,
smell yourself right now.

1896
02:20:22,831 --> 02:20:24,999
Because this moment is
what's wrong with you.

1897
02:20:25,209 --> 02:20:27,376
I got the transfer papers
in the trash can.

1898
02:20:27,753 --> 02:20:29,921
I'll get them and glue them the fuck up.

1899
02:20:30,255 --> 02:20:31,422
- Glue them up.
- What?

1900
02:20:31,673 --> 02:20:33,424
- Want some glue?
- We won't be partners no more.

1901
02:20:33,634 --> 02:20:34,675
I got glue in the car.

1902
02:20:34,927 --> 02:20:38,638
I'm trying to talk to you. It's hot,
I feel like I'm cooking in this fucker...

1903
02:20:38,847 --> 02:20:41,849
and I gotta hear shit out of you?
Then on top of that shit...

1904
02:20:42,059 --> 02:20:43,935
you gonna dog my baby sister?

1905
02:20:48,524 --> 02:20:50,399
Oh, this that bullshit!

1906
02:20:56,031 --> 02:20:57,240
Dad!

1907
02:20:57,449 --> 02:20:58,491
Dad!

1908
02:20:58,742 --> 02:21:02,286
I kept the warranty.
I kept the warranty!

1909
02:21:03,372 --> 02:21:05,248
Bad boys, bad boys

1910
02:21:05,499 --> 02:21:07,083
What you gonna do?

1911
02:21:07,334 --> 02:21:10,294
What you gonna do When we come for you?

1912
02:21:14,550 --> 02:21:16,843
Bad boys, bad

1913
02:21:19,888 --> 02:21:22,181
Come on, you gotta learn the words.

1914
02:21:22,391 --> 02:21:25,351
Mike, you don't know
the damn words either.

1915
02:21:25,561 --> 02:21:28,688
Bad boys, bad boys What you gonna do?

1916
02:21:29,022 --> 02:21:31,858
What you gonna do
When they come for you?
