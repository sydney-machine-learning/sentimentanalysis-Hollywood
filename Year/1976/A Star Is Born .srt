1
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:06,099
<i>Is this thing working?</i>

2
00:00:06,875 --> 00:00:10,311
<i>Are we getting anything?
I can't tell if it's on or not.</i>

3
00:00:11,813 --> 00:00:13,075
<i>It's on now. Thanks.</i>

4
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:16,208
<i>Folks, you want to listen
for a minute, please?</i>

5
00:00:16,284 --> 00:00:19,549
<i>Please, sit down. We don't want
to keep repeating these things...</i>

6
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:23,352
<i>but there are two or three of you assholes
out there who don't want to listen.</i>

7
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:25,120
<i>We're asking you to take your seats.</i>

8
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:28,094
<i>We cannot begin the show
until everyone is seated.</i>

9
00:00:28,163 --> 00:00:31,428
<i>Thanks for your cooperation,
we're sorry about the delay.</i>

10
00:01:07,302 --> 00:01:09,497
Rockwell, any sign of him?

11
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:17,134
God damn it,
it's been two-and-a-half hours.

12
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:18,702
Where the fuck is he?

13
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:36,789
Sounds like the gunfire
at the O.K. Corral out here.

14
00:01:36,865 --> 00:01:39,993
I don't know what's going on.
We may have to get the equipment off.

15
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:42,593
If he's not here in 15,
I'm putting the group on anyway.

16
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:08,718
Hold it.

17
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:27,178
Nanook of the North, let's go buddy.

18
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:29,342
Let's go, we got a show to do.

19
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:31,942
Get out of the car. Watch your hands.

20
00:02:32,087 --> 00:02:34,055
- Come on, let's go.
- John Norman, it's me.

21
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:35,714
You been out shopping, or what?

22
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:45,526
Let's go, let's clear the stage hall
out of here.

23
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,001
You people don't have backstage passes,
we're gonna find your asses out!

24
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,303
All of you, get the hell out of here!

25
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,104
Let's go, security.

26
00:02:55,177 --> 00:02:56,644
Where's my security?

27
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:59,441
You were hired to keep
these people out of this damn hall.

28
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:02,244
If you don't have backstage passes,
you get your asses out.

29
00:03:08,323 --> 00:03:12,020
Keep it going for four and a half,
then turn the amps on.

30
00:03:12,327 --> 00:03:13,988
Very good, Rockwell.

31
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:17,090
Little treat here for you, slick.

32
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:19,497
This will get you set.

33
00:03:29,044 --> 00:03:30,238
I'll be up here.

34
00:03:59,574 --> 00:04:00,563
Are you okay?

35
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:05,002
<i>Okay, folks,
I thank you for your patience.</i>

36
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,641
<i>Would you welcome please,
the John Norman Howard Speedway!</i>

37
00:04:22,097 --> 00:04:24,327
<i>Are you a figment of my imagination...</i>

38
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,534
<i>or am I one of yours?</i>

39
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,461
You guys aren't using
the new math on me?

40
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:08,525
Old logic. Half the people walk out,
the other half are comps.

41
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:11,163
Where was the promotion?
I didn't see any ads.

42
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:14,265
- Anybody see the ads?
- I don't see the big attraction.

43
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,636
<i>How's it going?</i>

44
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:24,184
<i>- "Don't be frightened, baby, come on in."
- I can't hear you.</i>

45
00:06:24,252 --> 00:06:26,516
"Don't be frightened, baby, come on in."

46
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:30,252
<i>- Is that all there is to it?
- That's all there is to it.</i>

47
00:06:30,325 --> 00:06:31,519
<i>That ain't so goddamn much.</i>

48
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:35,025
<i>I'm sorry, this booze'll blow your brain.</i>

49
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:38,359
- The refrain, friend!
- What's coming down?

50
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:40,424
<i>I have temporary amnesia.</i>

51
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:45,335
<i>No, listen, we did that song 3,726 times.</i>

52
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:48,103
- We've been waiting five fucking hours!
- Come on!

53
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:50,038
Yeah, let's go!

54
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:52,871
<i>- If you feel that way about it...
- Hey, turkey!</i>

55
00:06:54,716 --> 00:06:56,308
<i>...go to hell!</i>

56
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,235
Know what? Go with Nicky.

57
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:07,781
No, I know them all.
Honey, you get in this car.

58
00:09:07,849 --> 00:09:12,013
We'll sort out who's with who later.
Yeah, go on in, don't worry about it.

59
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:13,911
- No, baby.
- Security!

60
00:09:14,756 --> 00:09:16,587
Come here. Get these guys.

61
00:09:16,658 --> 00:09:18,592
Come on, John, don't you remember me?

62
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:21,787
I know an intern who can get you
some adrenalin.

63
00:09:22,297 --> 00:09:23,889
I mean, pure adrenalin.

64
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:26,866
- He rips it off from emergency hospitals.
- Move it.

65
00:09:34,842 --> 00:09:38,573
- 'Cause we need room for the truckers.
- How can I screw up a fella's bass?

66
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:41,706
- Got to go out for the rain date.
- Tonight was shit.

67
00:09:41,783 --> 00:09:43,580
And it's gonna be shit tomorrow night...

68
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:46,119
if you don't go home
and get some shuteye.

69
00:09:52,327 --> 00:09:53,794
Everybody out.

70
00:09:55,029 --> 00:09:56,929
Sweetheart, let me help you out.

71
00:09:56,998 --> 00:09:59,193
If you don't have a key,
see me at the desk.

72
00:10:03,004 --> 00:10:06,098
- I can do you, too.
- I got all the adrenalin I need.

73
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:09,403
- Let's go, Mo.
- Sweetheart, excuse me.

74
00:10:09,477 --> 00:10:12,071
Let's go up to the room,
roll one, get a good sleep...

75
00:10:12,146 --> 00:10:13,909
get a sound check, and make good music.

76
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:16,348
- What do you say?
- Not tonight, I can't sleep, man.

77
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:18,442
- Bobby, let's go boogie.
- Boogie?

78
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,977
Where you going to boogie to?
We've got a gig tomorrow. It's important.

79
00:10:23,758 --> 00:10:25,658
You don't seem to understand, jack.

80
00:10:25,727 --> 00:10:29,458
We had to book four groups in here
to get enough people to fill this place up.

81
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:33,466
Brian gave his word personally
that you'd show up straight enough...

82
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:37,095
to remember the words of the damn song,
and there's 50,000 people coming...

83
00:10:37,205 --> 00:10:39,139
to see if you've still got
something to show.

84
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:40,196
Are you ready?

85
00:10:41,275 --> 00:10:44,506
You horse's ass, it took a court order
to get you back on stage.

86
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:47,776
Don't you understand that?
After Detroit, your ass is on the line.

87
00:10:47,849 --> 00:10:49,680
- I'm not shitting you.
- The hell with it.

88
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:52,777
- Come on, Mo, let's go.
- Goddamn.

89
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,614
Hey...

90
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:02,853
- I don't want you to blow this deal.
- Floor it.

91
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:14,336
Where to?

92
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:18,475
Back about 10 years.

93
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,939
Yeah, but, what about tonight?

94
00:11:27,822 --> 00:11:30,950
<i>Will you welcome, please, the Oreos.</i>

95
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:49,670
- Sorry.
- What a thrill.

96
00:12:49,737 --> 00:12:51,705
I want to shake your hand, man.

97
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,500
I mean, I love the way you do it.

98
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:56,065
- Where you playing? You playing in town?
- No.

99
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:58,338
- Where you playing now?
- Stop.

100
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:01,274
Hey, man,
I wouldn't do anything to bug you.

101
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,253
Can I buy you a beer?

102
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:23,636
This table's reserved.

103
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:26,665
We got a nice table for you,
Mr. John Norman.

104
00:13:38,886 --> 00:13:40,410
Wine, beer, or herbal tea?

105
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:46,452
- What?
- Wine, beer, or herbal tea.

106
00:13:48,095 --> 00:13:49,892
- Those are the options?
- Right.

107
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:52,127
We don't have a license.

108
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,725
So what are you planning
to do with that bottle?

109
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:56,497
I was planning to open it.

110
00:13:56,571 --> 00:13:58,869
You can't do that,
we don't have a license.

111
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:07,845
Wine, beer, or herbal tea.

112
00:14:09,817 --> 00:14:12,342
Do you make herbal iced tea?

113
00:14:14,488 --> 00:14:17,924
- Bring me some herbal iced tea.
- Okay.

114
00:14:17,992 --> 00:14:21,052
- Without the herbal tea.
- Why don't you give me the bottle...

115
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,589
It's stupid.

116
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:30,498
We don't have a license.

117
00:14:31,405 --> 00:14:34,897
Well, you don't tell, and I won't tell.

118
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:38,434
- Don't you think you've had enough?
- Of what?

119
00:14:46,587 --> 00:14:48,418
I could lose my job this way.

120
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,323
Well, we don't want that to happen,
do we?

121
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:54,190
Just turn your back.
What you don't know won't hurt you.

122
00:14:58,499 --> 00:15:02,162
Why don't I hold
that bottle till you leave?

123
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,534
<i>What are you going to do with my bottle?</i>

124
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:08,803
Right on.

125
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,872
You're blowing my act.

126
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:18,007
Okay.

127
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:25,257
I'm sorry, really I am.

128
00:16:22,183 --> 00:16:24,174
You don't mind, John, just one?

129
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:28,148
Okay, smile.

130
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,418
Terrific.

131
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:32,819
Thanks, pal.

132
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:08,655
John Norman, how you doing?

133
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:09,855
Shut it, man.

134
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:13,197
I want a moment of peace.

135
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:15,766
Son of a bitch!

136
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:17,895
You ain't going dry while I'm around.

137
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:23,075
I'm Marty, this is Sheila.
She's a big fan of yours.

138
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:27,372
I saw you on TV,
I thought you were lousy...

139
00:17:27,448 --> 00:17:30,281
but Sheila, she really liked you.
Didn't you, Sheila?

140
00:17:30,885 --> 00:17:32,250
I thought he was okay.

141
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:37,850
- Let's listen to the song, man, it's great.
- That's shit.

142
00:17:37,925 --> 00:17:41,884
John Norman, why don't you
go up there and sing us a song.

143
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:44,861
I can't, they're working.

144
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:47,929
Don't tell me about work, superstar.
I work for a living!

145
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:50,994
- Shut up and let the lady sing.
- Shut up your goddamn self.

146
00:17:52,373 --> 00:17:54,739
She only bought every album
you ever made.

147
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:58,310
She paid for those clothes.
Now get up there and sing her a song!

148
00:18:00,014 --> 00:18:01,675
Not tonight, Sheila.

149
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:05,076
Just what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

150
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:07,484
It means this drink
ain't worth it, friend.

151
00:18:16,564 --> 00:18:18,293
What the hell is going on?

152
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:28,698
That's a hell of a way to act.

153
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:32,245
- Okay. Everybody's out!
- He didn't sing for me.

154
00:18:32,513 --> 00:18:34,310
Everybody out.

155
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:37,641
Pay your checks at the door.
We have to close for the night.

156
00:18:38,352 --> 00:18:40,445
Esther, don't forget your sweater.

157
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,778
See you, guys.

158
00:18:43,424 --> 00:18:45,949
- Through the back.
- Sing for me.

159
00:18:46,026 --> 00:18:47,891
- Wait up.
- He'll sing for you in the car.

160
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:52,161
- Hey, Mo!
- Look you better get out of here fast!

161
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:53,825
- I ain't going without you.
- What?

162
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:56,426
I don't even know you.
I know you, but I don't know you.

163
00:18:56,504 --> 00:18:58,597
Talk to me then.
Let's get inside. It's raining.

164
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:01,004
- I have to go home. Don't be silly.
- We'll drive you.

165
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:03,942
- Get in the car. We're getting wet.
- Wait a minute here.

166
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:06,036
Come on, go on, get out of here.

167
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,805
Just once, I'd like to go
someplace without a hassle.

168
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:11,681
- You're not responsible, right?
- I wish I was invisible.

169
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:14,050
You can really be invisible in this thing.

170
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:15,416
Want your bottle back?

171
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:18,686
- Oh, God, here they come.
- Hit it, Mo, here comes the posse.

172
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:21,886
Stop driving around here, you shithead.

173
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:24,624
- Come on back, honey.
- I'll beat you, man.

174
00:19:24,698 --> 00:19:27,098
- Can we go to the car now?
- Fucking star!

175
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:33,403
What am I doing in here? You're crazy.

176
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:35,905
You want everything, right?

177
00:19:36,277 --> 00:19:37,744
You're a hell of a singer.

178
00:19:37,811 --> 00:19:40,473
How could you tell?
You were talking through my whole song.

179
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:44,382
- Not me, that other guy wouldn't shut up.
- So you had to hit him, right?

180
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,146
What was I supposed to do?
Sit there and let him pop me.

181
00:19:47,221 --> 00:19:48,552
All you did was make him a hero.

182
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:51,785
You gave him a story for the next
couple of years. Are you drunk?

183
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:53,417
Jesus, you talk a lot.

184
00:19:53,494 --> 00:19:56,258
- I always talk a lot when I'm nervous.
- Where are we heading?

185
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,661
Back to the motel.

186
00:19:57,731 --> 00:20:00,529
No, 211 Orchid Street, please.
It's in Hollywood.

187
00:20:03,837 --> 00:20:06,806
Aren't you embarrassed
driving around in a thing like this?

188
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,069
Isn't this the kind of car
they use for funerals?

189
00:20:09,143 --> 00:20:12,442
- You change the subject a lot.
- What was the subject?

190
00:20:14,081 --> 00:20:16,072
God, you've got incredible eyes.

191
00:20:19,787 --> 00:20:20,947
Do you fish?

192
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:25,648
Do I what?

193
00:20:27,962 --> 00:20:31,693
- I was trying to tell you how you sing.
- Like a fish?

194
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:35,158
There's a rush.

195
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:40,404
There's a little ball of fire inside you
whenever you hook into a big marlin.

196
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:45,204
And you never forget it.
And that's what it felt like...

197
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,747
hearing you sing.

198
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:51,481
That's nice.

199
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:54,281
That sounded nice.

200
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:12,532
Check into a motel and call up Bobby.

201
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:16,303
- Well, thanks for the ride.
- Wait a minute, are you married?

202
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:19,904
Not anymore, why? Are you?

203
00:21:20,614 --> 00:21:22,605
Oh, Esther, how ridiculous.

204
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,248
You read about it
in the entertainment section.

205
00:21:25,352 --> 00:21:26,751
Listen, I'm sorry.

206
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,687
I'm not used to the rich and famous.
It makes me act stupid.

207
00:21:30,324 --> 00:21:33,555
You're acting okay. I ain't done so hot.

208
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:35,393
Let's start clean.

209
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:39,190
- You've got a beautiful mouth.
- Even though I talk too much?

210
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:40,756
You have a great ass.

211
00:21:41,135 --> 00:21:42,830
You live alone?

212
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,732
Terrific.

213
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,440
I wouldn't send up fireworks about it.

214
00:21:47,675 --> 00:21:50,940
- Well, actually, I want to come in.
- Well, actually, no.

215
00:21:51,011 --> 00:21:52,000
Why not?

216
00:21:57,084 --> 00:21:58,415
Listen...

217
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,881
if you want to come back for breakfast,
I'll make beaten biscuits.

218
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,857
- I don't eat breakfast.
- Oh, okay, well, good night.

219
00:22:05,926 --> 00:22:08,588
But I will, damn it.
And we'll have beaten breakfast.

220
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:10,687
Or beaten biscuits.

221
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:13,357
What time is it? It's got to be 4:00.

222
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:16,527
- In two hours I'll be back here at 6:00.
- Make it 7:00.

223
00:22:29,316 --> 00:22:31,784
Come on, wake up, it's 6:55.

224
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:38,013
Don't ever scare me like that again.

225
00:22:48,302 --> 00:22:49,394
Just a minute!

226
00:22:53,374 --> 00:22:54,966
I'll be right there!

227
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:03,280
Okay.

228
00:23:04,685 --> 00:23:06,084
Hi, it's me.

229
00:23:10,357 --> 00:23:11,449
Breakfast.

230
00:23:14,361 --> 00:23:17,524
- Sausage pizza for breakfast?
- No, it's pepperoni.

231
00:23:17,598 --> 00:23:20,499
- You got the biscuits ready?
- I never made biscuits in my life.

232
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:24,162
- I was just doing a number on you.
- I know, that's why I brought the pizza.

233
00:23:24,438 --> 00:23:27,669
Got anything to drink?
Anything to drink in here?

234
00:23:28,542 --> 00:23:30,339
You mean like orange juice?

235
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:34,848
- Trying to improve my character?
- You could use it.

236
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:39,643
<i>- Hello, brother.
- Where are you?</i>

237
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,518
<i>- Back...
- Beer, wine, anything?</i>

238
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:47,886
<i>- Now, listen, slick, whatever it is...
- Mo will get us to the airport.</i>

239
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:52,061
You just save us a place on the chopper.
I'm bringing someone with me.

240
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:54,496
- What's your name?
- Esther Hoffman.

241
00:23:55,536 --> 00:23:56,525
Hoffman?

242
00:23:57,404 --> 00:23:58,928
Jesus, I love that.

243
00:23:59,473 --> 00:24:00,531
Why?

244
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:03,940
In the past year, I bet you're
the only girl I've met with a last name.

245
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:07,037
<i>Be there! Are you gonna be there?
You better be there!</i>

246
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:09,138
<i>- You be there!
- I'll be there, Bobby.</i>

247
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,013
<i>- Just be there, damn it!
- I'll be there.</i>

248
00:24:13,053 --> 00:24:14,987
What went wrong?

249
00:24:16,223 --> 00:24:18,088
- With what?
- It's "with whom."

250
00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:20,016
Your old man.

251
00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:24,920
He put mayonnaise
on his liver and onions.

252
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:27,431
He wouldn't fight.

253
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:29,464
There you go.

254
00:24:30,404 --> 00:24:31,803
You like a fight.

255
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:36,037
Less tenderness, more on the wild side.

256
00:24:41,448 --> 00:24:44,679
I can take all the tenderness you got,
as a matter of fact.

257
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:50,056
Eat your breakfast.

258
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:55,219
- I told you, I don't eat breakfast.
- What are you doing here, then?

259
00:24:55,729 --> 00:24:57,196
I'm picking you up.

260
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:00,800
There's some raceway, we got a concert.

261
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,268
I'm not that kind of girl.

262
00:25:03,337 --> 00:25:06,329
First we meet through mutual friends,
then you call me in a week.

263
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:09,136
- Then I think about it.
- It's this afternoon.

264
00:25:10,277 --> 00:25:12,074
But you didn't even ask me.

265
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:16,847
I swear, I got the manners of a hog.

266
00:25:18,318 --> 00:25:19,751
Esther...

267
00:25:20,053 --> 00:25:23,022
- it'd mean a lot to me if you came.
- Okay, I'll come.

268
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:53,576
Tell me again how
you like to be invisible.

269
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,514
- Esther Hoffman.
- How do you do?

270
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,955
Bless your heart!

271
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:32,450
Let's go.

272
00:26:56,516 --> 00:26:59,508
- All right, this is me getting up.
- Are the people following?

273
00:26:59,586 --> 00:27:01,679
This is what I hired you for,
God damn it.

274
00:27:01,755 --> 00:27:03,222
I'm sorry. Get that off.

275
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,190
Here they are.

276
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,391
Esther, that's good. I'm Gary Danziger.

277
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:11,056
John Norman's PR man.

278
00:27:11,531 --> 00:27:14,091
Bobby told me about you.
This is Pumpkin, everybody.

279
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:16,101
Rolling in to it.

280
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:19,137
Is your last name Pie?

281
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,147
<i>It's all right!</i>

282
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:38,916
<i>Let's get crazy down in the first row.</i>

283
00:27:39,526 --> 00:27:41,050
Where's Rockwell?

284
00:27:43,897 --> 00:27:45,626
Let's go.

285
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:47,630
Over here.

286
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:52,364
John. There you are.

287
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:56,402
How is it?

288
00:27:57,911 --> 00:27:59,401
Smell the monsters in there.

289
00:28:04,484 --> 00:28:07,248
<i>Okay, folks, good things
are certainly worth waiting for.</i>

290
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,153
<i>Would you welcome
John Norman Howard Speedway!</i>

291
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:07,672
<i>Are you a figment of my imagination,
or am I one of yours?</i>

292
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:51,545
Come on out
and see how it feels in the lights.

293
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:53,044
No!

294
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,956
<i>- There aren't any lights!
- You want lights? Give her lights!</i>

295
00:30:59,326 --> 00:31:02,227
John, the audience is gonna walk out.
Anyway, the sun's out.

296
00:31:02,596 --> 00:31:04,996
<i>Strike the sun and give her a pink spot.</i>

297
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:07,359
You are crazy, you better go back there.

298
00:31:07,434 --> 00:31:10,369
They are gonna get mad at you.
Go back on the stage!

299
00:31:13,773 --> 00:31:17,174
- Hey, where are you going?
- I'm going with her, Bob, is that okay?

300
00:31:20,747 --> 00:31:22,977
- Oh, man, you're beautiful.
- You're crazy.

301
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:24,676
I love what you do.

302
00:31:24,751 --> 00:31:27,242
Can't say much for your kissing
but I love your bike.

303
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,811
It's yours, man. I mean it, it's yours.

304
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,757
- You got to be kidding.
- Come on, John.

305
00:31:32,826 --> 00:31:34,453
Get back on the stage.

306
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:51,741
You're gonna kill yourself!

307
00:31:51,811 --> 00:31:54,006
Just giving them what they want.

308
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:09,017
Stop him.

309
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:17,729
Get off that motorcycle.
Get off that goddamn motorcycle.

310
00:32:31,284 --> 00:32:35,015
<i>- Rockwell, get me an ambulance!
- Okay, folks, he's all right.</i>

311
00:32:35,088 --> 00:32:39,286
<i>Believe me, he is okay.
Please move away from the scene.</i>

312
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:41,850
<i>If anyone's hurt,
go to the medical aid station.</i>

313
00:32:41,928 --> 00:32:46,092
<i>Please move back, let the stretcher
through right in front here.</i>

314
00:32:46,166 --> 00:32:48,600
<i>Let the stretcher through, please.</i>

315
00:32:48,668 --> 00:32:51,034
<i>Please move back
from the front of the stage.</i>

316
00:32:51,104 --> 00:32:52,867
<i>Everything will be okay.</i>

317
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:07,249
That's the third time he's done that.

318
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:09,887
Move it.

319
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,623
Wait up!

320
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:04,636
<i>This time, only 17 people were hurt.</i>

321
00:34:05,512 --> 00:34:09,778
Sweetheart, listen to me, Brian is trying
to turn this disaster into a plus.

322
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:11,476
Yeah, dignity. We give it dignity.

323
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:14,111
<i>We plant a story with Time,
The New York Times.</i>

324
00:34:14,187 --> 00:34:15,814
- Not just the rock creeps.
- Good idea.

325
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:18,255
How about something simple,
like "nobody was killed"?

326
00:34:18,324 --> 00:34:20,315
I'm with John Norman Howard,
what's doing?

327
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,619
Portside, that's where the action is.

328
00:34:23,396 --> 00:34:26,627
- Bloody Mary.
- You go by her house?

329
00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:28,423
Who's that?

330
00:34:29,836 --> 00:34:32,964
- Esther.
- Yes, she wasn't home.

331
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:35,837
Son of a bitch. Why won't she call me?

332
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:38,304
What is all this fuss about this girl?

333
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:40,505
Maybe she just doesn't like your style.

334
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,411
When Brian says he's canceling the tour...

335
00:34:42,482 --> 00:34:46,441
he does not mean it in a pejorative
or punitive way, sweetheart.

336
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:49,181
- It'll be John Norman's decision.
- I don't have all day.

337
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:51,450
- Let's move it.
- What? Cancel what out?

338
00:34:52,058 --> 00:34:55,391
The tour's a disaster and the promoters
won't take that kind of shit.

339
00:34:55,528 --> 00:34:59,225
Late starts and the legal hassles,
damage to the halls.

340
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:01,297
Somebody has to be realistic. Yes?

341
00:35:01,367 --> 00:35:04,632
$27,000 deducted for vodka,
$11,000 for orange juice.

342
00:35:04,704 --> 00:35:06,365
The man likes screwdrivers.

343
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:09,169
Why don't you go and get laid,
it's been almost three hours.

344
00:35:09,242 --> 00:35:12,575
- Then there's the tax lean.
- We've got 50% going out to taxes.

345
00:35:12,812 --> 00:35:17,215
By the time he pays his agent's fees,
business management, expenses, dues...

346
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:19,285
What does the government
want from him?

347
00:35:19,352 --> 00:35:23,789
$186,654.32.

348
00:35:27,694 --> 00:35:29,457
Come on, John.

349
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:32,690
You're getting to be a cosmic joke.
Come on, enough is enough.

350
00:35:32,932 --> 00:35:35,594
John, I've had inexhaustible patience.

351
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:37,770
Come on, man, I've kept my temper.

352
00:35:37,837 --> 00:35:41,773
I've left you alone to do as you please.
Now you've got to help.

353
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:45,868
I can put you into the Indian Relief
Benefit, if you get there on time.

354
00:35:45,945 --> 00:35:47,344
The promoters don't give a shit.

355
00:35:47,413 --> 00:35:49,779
They'll put you in anything,
if they can make a buck.

356
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:52,374
<i>- Who the hell is that?
- John Norman Howard...</i>

357
00:35:52,552 --> 00:35:56,682
<i>an oldie but a goodie on KLAX.
Hey, John Norman...</i>

358
00:35:56,823 --> 00:36:00,259
<i>- Wait a minute, Bebe Jesus.
- Bebe Jesus.</i>

359
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:03,727
<i>Hey, big John, why don't you
come down and rap with us, man...</i>

360
00:36:03,796 --> 00:36:06,162
<i>on our All-time Top 40 weekend?</i>

361
00:36:06,232 --> 00:36:08,860
<i>Three of which
are John Norman Howard's.</i>

362
00:36:08,935 --> 00:36:11,995
<i>Platinum Planet played by Bebe Jesus!</i>

363
00:36:12,071 --> 00:36:15,529
<i>50,000 watts of KLAX power, man.</i>

364
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:18,270
<i>- John Norman, up here.
- John!</i>

365
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:21,637
<i>Don't shoot, big John.
Hey, man, we're on your side, man.</i>

366
00:36:21,714 --> 00:36:22,703
Don't do it!

367
00:36:24,584 --> 00:36:25,642
<i>See that?</i>

368
00:36:25,718 --> 00:36:27,447
You crazy bastard.

369
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:31,286
<i>48 straight hit-making hours and not once
am I gonna mention your name.</i>

370
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:32,722
<i>Shit face!</i>

371
00:36:33,426 --> 00:36:35,291
Very funny, Howard.

372
00:36:36,129 --> 00:36:37,790
Hello, police?

373
00:36:39,465 --> 00:36:41,433
I need to report a sniper.

374
00:36:41,734 --> 00:36:42,894
A sniper.

375
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:45,900
That's an unknown person who fires a gun.

376
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:49,174
God damn it,
I don't know how many shots he fired.

377
00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:52,040
He just fired at us. That's all.
I'm Bobby Ritchie.

378
00:36:52,111 --> 00:36:54,579
John Norman Howard's road manager.

379
00:36:54,948 --> 00:36:57,712
I love it here in Hollywood,
it's so much fun.

380
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,209
<i>Honey.</i>

381
00:37:02,255 --> 00:37:05,122
<i>- You, the one on the right.
- Which one?</i>

382
00:37:05,425 --> 00:37:07,689
<i>The kinky-headed one. Yeah, you.</i>

383
00:37:08,228 --> 00:37:10,696
<i>You're too strong anyway,
pull it down some.</i>

384
00:37:10,763 --> 00:37:13,891
<i>- Okay, listen, one more time, okay?
- Okay.</i>

385
00:37:15,768 --> 00:37:17,998
I know it's funny,
but we need the money.

386
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:21,803
<i>- Take 7.
- We got the first part, let's do a pick up.</i>

387
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:26,768
<i>Girls, we've already got the first part,
so let's just pick it up from:</i>

388
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,940
<i>- "Kittens have to chew."
- Okay.</i>

389
00:37:30,016 --> 00:37:31,847
<i>- It's "Love to chew."
- "Love to chew."</i>

390
00:37:31,918 --> 00:37:33,545
<i>"That kittens love to chew."</i>

391
00:37:33,686 --> 00:37:35,881
<i>"That kittens love to chew."</i>

392
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:37,923
<i>- Right. Yes, sir.
- Got it, all right.</i>

393
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:39,887
<i>Rolling.</i>

394
00:37:40,326 --> 00:37:43,090
<i>Meow Chow cat food commercial, Take 7.</i>

395
00:37:44,063 --> 00:37:45,553
I'm hungry.

396
00:37:56,709 --> 00:38:00,736
This is terrible, you can't...
How do you think the old cats feel?

397
00:38:00,847 --> 00:38:02,678
<i>Forget about that. Just get rid of her.</i>

398
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:05,149
<i>Okay, girls, Take 10.
Try to pull yourselves together.</i>

399
00:38:05,218 --> 00:38:06,742
<i>- Okay.
- We don't have time for this.</i>

400
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:08,081
<i>Get rid of her.</i>

401
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:15,958
- What's the matter? What's wrong?
- I always crack up when I'm sad.

402
00:38:16,029 --> 00:38:18,589
<i>Okay, girls, thank you. That's it.</i>

403
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:22,332
I'm sorry.

404
00:38:22,669 --> 00:38:24,159
I'm allergic to cats anyway.

405
00:38:27,974 --> 00:38:28,963
- See you later.
- Okay.

406
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:49,088
<i>I got a phone in here.
I can have a cop in here in a minute.</i>

407
00:38:49,529 --> 00:38:50,894
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

408
00:38:51,164 --> 00:38:52,495
<i>Who gives a rat's ass?</i>

409
00:38:53,132 --> 00:38:57,000
You took a shot at me, man.
My lawyers are talking about it.

410
00:38:59,038 --> 00:39:01,336
Okay. What the hell is it?

411
00:39:09,816 --> 00:39:11,477
<i>KLAX with Bebe Jesus.</i>

412
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:13,746
<i>You'll never guess
who just walked in here...</i>

413
00:39:13,853 --> 00:39:15,821
<i>with his hat in his hand.</i>

414
00:39:16,222 --> 00:39:18,816
<i>I'm not even going to mention his name
on the air.</i>

415
00:39:18,891 --> 00:39:22,725
<i>But his lawyers told him he better
get on the right side of Bebe Jesus...</i>

416
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:25,855
<i>because Bebe don't take no jive...</i>

417
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:28,660
<i>from no burned-out superstar.</i>

418
00:39:28,935 --> 00:39:31,563
<i>- Who needs him?
- I said I'm sorry.</i>

419
00:39:32,772 --> 00:39:35,400
<i>Oh, he says he's sorry.</i>

420
00:39:35,975 --> 00:39:39,706
<i>Can't bite no more,
but he still can lick.</i>

421
00:39:40,747 --> 00:39:42,510
<i>Why don't you take this...</i>

422
00:39:43,649 --> 00:39:47,278
shit, or whatever it is,
out of my office.

423
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,019
<i>Because I don't take nothing from you.
I don't take your bribe.</i>

424
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,785
<i>And I'll tell you why...</i>

425
00:39:52,925 --> 00:39:55,018
<i>because you are a rude...</i>

426
00:39:55,094 --> 00:39:57,028
<i>joyless, burned-out...</i>

427
00:39:57,096 --> 00:39:59,587
<i>spoiled pain in the ass!</i>

428
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:02,190
<i>And we're bored by you.</i>

429
00:40:07,006 --> 00:40:10,464
Stop that son of a bitch!
Get a cop down here, man.

430
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:13,374
This fucker's crazy,
get a cop down here!

431
00:40:13,446 --> 00:40:15,778
You son of a bitch! Fucker!

432
00:40:15,848 --> 00:40:18,510
Send the bill to my business manager.

433
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:24,115
He'll lose his money.
Came in the studio and went berserk.

434
00:40:24,223 --> 00:40:26,555
He never had a woman
he didn't send away screaming.

435
00:40:26,692 --> 00:40:28,319
Who told you that?

436
00:40:28,394 --> 00:40:31,557
Nobody told me. I read it
at the check stand at the supermarket.

437
00:40:31,631 --> 00:40:32,825
But he's cute.

438
00:40:32,932 --> 00:40:34,991
Look, guys, I'll see you later, okay?

439
00:40:35,368 --> 00:40:38,269
- There he is.
- Speak of the devil.

440
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:42,136
- Excuse me.
- Where did you go?

441
00:40:46,412 --> 00:40:49,438
Everywhere you go fighting
breaks out and things get broken.

442
00:40:49,515 --> 00:40:50,914
Have you noticed that?

443
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,985
I called you eight times.
How come you never called me back?

444
00:40:54,053 --> 00:40:56,180
- Excuse me.
- How come you never called me back?

445
00:40:56,255 --> 00:40:57,244
I tried three times.

446
00:40:57,323 --> 00:40:59,257
The fourth time,
I got a disconnected number.

447
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:02,260
What do you mean?
Oh, Jesus! Hey, what's the date?

448
00:41:02,328 --> 00:41:03,420
Oh, God.

449
00:41:03,563 --> 00:41:07,693
They change my phone every six weeks,
because I get all these whacko calls.

450
00:41:07,767 --> 00:41:10,201
Listen, I'm really glad you're okay.

451
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:14,069
And I'd like to wish you lots of luck,
because you'll need it.

452
00:41:14,373 --> 00:41:16,170
Wait a minute.

453
00:41:16,709 --> 00:41:18,939
It'll never work.
I'm a non-violent person.

454
00:41:19,011 --> 00:41:21,707
- We got so many things to talk about.
- I don't think so.

455
00:41:21,781 --> 00:41:23,578
Yeah, we do. I need to know some things.

456
00:41:23,649 --> 00:41:26,209
I don't even know
your Social Security number.

457
00:41:28,054 --> 00:41:31,217
You could've reached me if
you'd wanted to. I'm real easy to reach.

458
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:33,815
All you got to do
is call my public relations man...

459
00:41:33,893 --> 00:41:36,919
he calls my agent, my agent calls
my business manager...

460
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:39,863
who calls my personal manager,
he calls the secretary...

461
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:44,266
who makes a list and gives it to me
in a green folder every other Tuesday.

462
00:41:44,337 --> 00:41:48,068
- Which you never open.
- Which I give unopened to my PR man.

463
00:41:48,241 --> 00:41:49,640
To handle.

464
00:41:51,244 --> 00:41:53,508
- It's my birthday today.
- What?

465
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:56,480
It's my birthday. I can't handle it.
Let's run away.

466
00:41:57,283 --> 00:41:59,615
Or meet my mother, or marry me.

467
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:04,650
Sure, maybe when you need a tambourine
I get to shake it.

468
00:42:04,991 --> 00:42:06,288
Maybe.

469
00:42:07,793 --> 00:42:08,885
Esther...

470
00:42:10,162 --> 00:42:11,857
I want you.

471
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:14,356
I don't want to lose you again.

472
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:22,364
Is today really your birthday?

473
00:42:23,142 --> 00:42:25,269
You just changed the subject again.

474
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,843
Where's the hearse?

475
00:42:31,651 --> 00:42:32,913
Come on.

476
00:42:33,586 --> 00:42:35,679
I bought it
because it looked so much like you.

477
00:42:35,755 --> 00:42:38,223
- What do you mean?
- Fast and out of my league.

478
00:42:54,106 --> 00:42:56,472
One of the privileges of wealth?

479
00:43:07,887 --> 00:43:10,321
- Calm them down.
- I ain't getting out.

480
00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:12,646
Hold them, Mo.

481
00:43:12,725 --> 00:43:14,192
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

482
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,421
Can't you guys be more friendly?

483
00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:17,621
Don't be afraid.

484
00:43:18,698 --> 00:43:20,928
Come on, boys, we got company.

485
00:43:22,034 --> 00:43:25,265
See how they listen to me?
Don't be scared, they're harmless.

486
00:43:25,338 --> 00:43:27,806
You like living like this?

487
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,334
Like what?

488
00:43:38,985 --> 00:43:41,249
How many rooms are you
crammed into here?

489
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,283
I don't know exactly.

490
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,414
This is a funny place.

491
00:43:47,493 --> 00:43:49,893
Yeah, I haven't got it all together yet.

492
00:43:50,696 --> 00:43:52,186
Wow!

493
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,534
What are you planning here?
A skating rink, or what?

494
00:43:56,669 --> 00:43:58,500
It's going to be a studio.

495
00:43:59,405 --> 00:44:00,804
This is wild.

496
00:44:01,007 --> 00:44:03,475
You can throw
your own block party, indoors.

497
00:44:03,576 --> 00:44:05,635
We're going to record here.

498
00:44:06,078 --> 00:44:08,603
If we ever get the acoustics right.

499
00:44:10,149 --> 00:44:13,607
Well, as long as you're having fun in it.

500
00:44:15,254 --> 00:44:18,621
Otherwise, I'd get rid of it.

501
00:44:19,992 --> 00:44:21,983
Yeah, that's what I'd do.

502
00:44:22,128 --> 00:44:24,460
They tell me it's an investment.

503
00:44:26,098 --> 00:44:29,397
When you want to eat,
you order in some deli?

504
00:44:31,237 --> 00:44:33,205
Chinese takeout, mostly.

505
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:39,978
- Are you an alcoholic?
- Probably.

506
00:44:41,614 --> 00:44:43,844
You could have used
some vocational guidance.

507
00:44:45,284 --> 00:44:47,343
Well, what did I do wrong?

508
00:44:48,621 --> 00:44:51,613
You're living in a million-dollar slum.
Why do you do that?

509
00:44:52,425 --> 00:44:54,586
What were you, rich or poor?

510
00:44:57,830 --> 00:44:59,229
You're cute.

511
00:44:59,632 --> 00:45:01,156
You are fucking cute.

512
00:45:04,937 --> 00:45:07,064
Who are you, Esther Hoffman?

513
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,707
Where did you come from?

514
00:45:09,775 --> 00:45:11,470
There are so many rooms here.

515
00:45:13,345 --> 00:45:16,678
This is a great house for people
who never want to see each other.

516
00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:18,979
Come on, I'll give you a tour.

517
00:45:22,655 --> 00:45:24,782
Where are the phones? No phones?

518
00:45:24,857 --> 00:45:27,485
There's one out by the pool,
when I need it.

519
00:45:29,128 --> 00:45:31,392
I just happen to love it
when the phone rings.

520
00:45:32,631 --> 00:45:36,567
You won't love it, when it wakes you up
at 4:00 in the morning.

521
00:45:37,136 --> 00:45:40,936
Somebody you never heard of is calling
to tell you he's full of Quaaludes...

522
00:45:42,141 --> 00:45:43,870
and he's got a gun...

523
00:45:45,845 --> 00:45:48,780
and you're the only person in the world
who can tell him...

524
00:45:49,482 --> 00:45:52,178
why he shouldn't use it.

525
00:45:56,622 --> 00:45:58,453
Aren't you going to cross my "T"?

526
00:46:00,926 --> 00:46:02,484
How clumsy of me.

527
00:46:06,031 --> 00:46:07,328
Why do they call you?

528
00:46:08,033 --> 00:46:10,729
They love my music.
They think I got all the answers.

529
00:46:10,803 --> 00:46:12,566
You mean, you don't?

530
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:16,108
I don't even understand the questions.

531
00:46:24,483 --> 00:46:27,043
- Who cleans up around here?
- I don't know.

532
00:46:37,997 --> 00:46:41,125
- You don't know?
- My manager takes care of it.

533
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,559
I'm always on a plane somewhere.

534
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,940
Too many takeoffs, too many landings...

535
00:46:50,276 --> 00:46:52,836
too many places I didn't want to go.

536
00:46:53,879 --> 00:46:56,109
I've been on too many planes.

537
00:46:56,782 --> 00:46:58,682
I've only been on two.

538
00:46:59,285 --> 00:47:01,981
Wait a minute, is a helicopter a plane?

539
00:47:03,622 --> 00:47:05,852
I got to teach you everything.

540
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:10,822
Been on two planes
and you think you got the answer to...

541
00:47:12,231 --> 00:47:14,062
for anyone who calls you up.

542
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:20,566
How many names have you painted
around this house?

543
00:47:23,509 --> 00:47:24,601
One.

544
00:48:08,888 --> 00:48:11,288
Jesus, that's pretty. What is it?

545
00:48:11,757 --> 00:48:13,156
Just a little piece I wrote.

546
00:48:13,225 --> 00:48:15,750
I keep hoping
it'll be a sonata when it grows up.

547
00:48:16,896 --> 00:48:18,591
Make a hell of a song.

548
00:48:18,664 --> 00:48:22,691
I can't imagine that. It goes so high,
nobody could ever sing it.

549
00:48:23,002 --> 00:48:26,233
Play it again.
Just like you done it before.

550
00:48:26,472 --> 00:48:28,565
- Real sweet.
- Okay.

551
00:48:28,641 --> 00:48:31,269
With them little allegros or whatever.

552
00:48:31,644 --> 00:48:34,374
Arpeggios. Okay.

553
00:49:14,687 --> 00:49:16,655
I'm sorry. That was so good!

554
00:49:16,722 --> 00:49:19,156
- Don't quit.
- I got so lost in what you were doing...

555
00:49:19,224 --> 00:49:22,716
- I forgot my own song. Can we continue?
- Yeah.

556
00:49:24,363 --> 00:49:27,821
- Pick it up, right where you were.
- Okay. Right where I was going.

557
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,831
Okay, ready?

558
00:49:32,871 --> 00:49:34,065
No.

559
00:49:35,841 --> 00:49:38,969
We got to get past that word
or you'll never forgive me.

560
00:49:40,045 --> 00:49:41,740
Come on, it gets prettier.

561
00:49:42,381 --> 00:49:44,576
I really did forget my song.

562
00:49:45,651 --> 00:49:47,516
Wait. Ready, get set, go.

563
00:49:47,586 --> 00:49:50,180
- It's a pretty song. Family hour.
- Ready? Here we go.

564
00:50:19,018 --> 00:50:21,009
God, that's wonderful.

565
00:50:22,588 --> 00:50:24,146
It's your song.

566
00:50:25,557 --> 00:50:27,582
Is that inside your head?

567
00:54:09,181 --> 00:54:12,446
- You're so pretty.
- Oh, kiss my ass.

568
00:54:15,153 --> 00:54:17,087
- Let's do it again.
- I'm tired.

569
00:54:17,155 --> 00:54:18,486
Come on.

570
00:54:18,557 --> 00:54:20,684
You want to make me into a machine?

571
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:24,422
- I want to make you a perfectionist.
- I already am a perfectionist.

572
00:54:25,597 --> 00:54:29,465
Running in and picking up the bathmat
after every shower I take doesn't count.

573
00:54:29,668 --> 00:54:31,659
- You noticed that?
- Do it.

574
00:54:37,276 --> 00:54:39,836
Wait. Again.

575
00:54:45,384 --> 00:54:47,113
Wait a minute. Again.

576
00:54:50,922 --> 00:54:53,823
Now that's closer.
You got a little righteous anger into it.

577
00:54:53,892 --> 00:54:56,053
You reckon you can handle two lines?

578
00:54:56,295 --> 00:54:58,058
I reckon I can try.

579
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:00,255
Well, then, play it for me.

580
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:09,064
I also wash out your hairbrush.

581
00:55:09,408 --> 00:55:11,205
Just what am I supposed to tell Brian?

582
00:55:11,276 --> 00:55:14,109
You're standing here,
your album is three months overdue.

583
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:16,170
They got a beef and it's legitimate.

584
00:55:17,182 --> 00:55:19,207
Listen, they said your tour was shit...

585
00:55:19,284 --> 00:55:23,118
you're handing in old stuff you rejected...
Turn that down a minute.

586
00:55:23,288 --> 00:55:25,279
Yet you rejected from old albums.

587
00:55:25,457 --> 00:55:28,324
Where's your new stuff?
And now you're recording a chick.

588
00:55:28,393 --> 00:55:30,486
She's great.

589
00:55:30,562 --> 00:55:32,223
I know she's great, I love her, man.

590
00:55:32,297 --> 00:55:34,595
But if you're going to record her,
record her right.

591
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:36,861
Get her with somebody
who can complement her.

592
00:55:36,935 --> 00:55:38,334
I don't think it's Speedway.

593
00:55:38,403 --> 00:55:41,634
I wanted something to show somebody,
and I got who I know.

594
00:55:41,707 --> 00:55:44,005
Shit, Bobby, these guys are as good
as you can get.

595
00:55:44,076 --> 00:55:45,600
Slick, don't pull that shit with me.

596
00:55:45,677 --> 00:55:47,941
I know who they are,
I know how good they are...

597
00:55:48,013 --> 00:55:49,776
and what they got that is special.

598
00:55:50,082 --> 00:55:51,310
John Norman?

599
00:55:52,117 --> 00:55:54,585
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
- Certainly.

600
00:55:54,653 --> 00:55:56,382
- How are you doing, baby?
- Look...

601
00:55:56,455 --> 00:55:59,015
you know I'm grateful and all that, right?

602
00:55:59,624 --> 00:56:02,855
- And they're fantastic musicians, but...
- What's wrong?

603
00:56:06,198 --> 00:56:08,029
It's just not like what's in my head.

604
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,627
- How do you hear it?
- They have these guitar things going...

605
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:16,603
I love it. I love this part, don't you?

606
00:56:16,675 --> 00:56:18,802
And the piano also is going like this...

607
00:56:19,344 --> 00:56:21,141
You know? Like chords like that.

608
00:56:21,213 --> 00:56:23,841
Instead of...
What I hear is a kind of rolling thing.

609
00:56:26,017 --> 00:56:28,110
- Classical? Like classical?
- Yeah.

610
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,217
It's your move.
This one's on you, slick.

611
00:56:30,322 --> 00:56:33,018
I feel embarrassed,
I don't know how to tell them.

612
00:56:33,959 --> 00:56:36,052
Well, you're exactly right.

613
00:56:36,928 --> 00:56:38,987
- And I'll tell them.
- Oh, great.

614
00:56:39,097 --> 00:56:41,998
- Thank you.
- Thank you, John.

615
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:48,198
I'm not bad for him.

616
00:56:48,273 --> 00:56:50,537
- Well, he ain't working.
- Man, that was great.

617
00:56:50,609 --> 00:56:54,170
He can pass a day without being drunk
and can sleep without downers.

618
00:56:54,246 --> 00:56:58,205
- So we're gonna try it again tomorrow.
- He ain't working, Esther. Rock and roll.

619
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,039
It's your dime.

620
00:57:00,152 --> 00:57:03,553
- So tomorrow we record it as she wants it.
- God damn it, women.

621
01:00:10,642 --> 01:00:11,836
<i>Okay.</i>

622
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:16,745
<i>We're really happy to have with us
for the American Indian Relief Fund...</i>

623
01:00:16,815 --> 01:00:20,842
<i>the star of our show,
the John Norman Howard Speedway!</i>

624
01:00:32,764 --> 01:00:36,256
<i>Are you a figment of my imagination,
or am I one of yours?</i>

625
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:00,487
Get ready for anything now.

626
01:01:02,961 --> 01:01:05,054
<i>Wait, hear me out. At ease.</i>

627
01:01:07,032 --> 01:01:10,729
<i>Now wait a minute, you just think
you want to hear that same old shit.</i>

628
01:01:11,302 --> 01:01:14,965
<i>This being a benefit, hold it,
for a good cause...</i>

629
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,237
<i>and just by being here
you all deserve more than you're getting...</i>

630
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:21,608
<i>so, we're fixed to do you all a favor.
Hold it.</i>

631
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:25,178
<i>Me and the boys
stumbled onto something real...</i>

632
01:01:25,483 --> 01:01:27,075
<i>a little while back.</i>

633
01:01:27,352 --> 01:01:29,718
<i>It's so good. That's right.</i>

634
01:01:29,988 --> 01:01:33,583
That crazy son of a bitch.
This may have something to do with you.

635
01:01:33,858 --> 01:01:35,849
Me? What are you talking about?

636
01:01:36,394 --> 01:01:37,952
<i>Well, keep it up, man.</i>

637
01:01:38,029 --> 01:01:40,554
<i>You got the corner
on the ignorance market!</i>

638
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:47,333
What's going on?

639
01:01:47,939 --> 01:01:50,703
- What are you doing, you bastard?
- Trust me.

640
01:01:50,909 --> 01:01:52,740
- Why should I trust you?
- Let's go.

641
01:01:52,811 --> 01:01:54,176
- Why not?
- Oh, shut up.

642
01:01:55,246 --> 01:01:57,544
I am not prepared. What are you doing?

643
01:01:57,716 --> 01:02:00,082
You just recorded 10 songs
with these guys.

644
01:02:00,151 --> 01:02:01,140
Motherfucker.

645
01:02:01,753 --> 01:02:04,278
- Charm them.
- What am I going to sing?

646
01:02:05,957 --> 01:02:08,391
<i>All right, that's real good.</i>

647
01:02:09,127 --> 01:02:11,618
<i>We've seen your act,
now shut the fuck up.</i>

648
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:15,763
<i>Give the lady a chance, all right?</i>

649
01:02:20,472 --> 01:02:22,269
<i>A friend of mine...</i>

650
01:02:22,507 --> 01:02:24,202
<i>Esther Hoffman.</i>

651
01:02:35,754 --> 01:02:38,450
<i>- Why don't you do Woman in the Moon?
- Okay.</i>

652
01:07:06,441 --> 01:07:07,499
I love you.

653
01:07:07,575 --> 01:07:09,543
Great. You got some more to do.

654
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:13,206
No. Really.

655
01:07:13,315 --> 01:07:14,942
Promise you won't go away?

656
01:07:15,016 --> 01:07:16,415
You stay right here.

657
01:10:23,905 --> 01:10:26,135
- Hold on, you don't wanna leave.
- Where is John?

658
01:10:26,207 --> 01:10:28,266
I remember you,
I'm sure you don't remember me.

659
01:10:28,343 --> 01:10:30,607
- I remember you. How's your pumpkin?
- That's good!

660
01:10:30,678 --> 01:10:32,737
- I want you to meet some people.
- There she is!

661
01:10:32,947 --> 01:10:34,642
Esther!

662
01:10:35,183 --> 01:10:36,548
Hello, I'm Freddie Lowenstein.

663
01:10:36,618 --> 01:10:38,313
- The JS's agent.
- You were awesome.

664
01:10:38,386 --> 01:10:39,375
Thank you.

665
01:10:40,588 --> 01:10:43,284
- I want you to meet Brian Wexler.
- That was extraordinary.

666
01:10:43,458 --> 01:10:46,120
- John Norman's manager.
- How do you do?

667
01:10:46,361 --> 01:10:47,623
Very nice to meet you.

668
01:10:49,063 --> 01:10:51,088
Did you see John Norman?
Where is John Norman?

669
01:10:51,165 --> 01:10:52,359
I'll get John Norman for you.

670
01:10:52,433 --> 01:10:54,560
- I'll get him.
- Please get him for me.

671
01:10:55,503 --> 01:10:58,131
No, this ain't gonna happen now.
I'll get back to you.

672
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:00,474
We'll send a bio in the morning,
you hear me?

673
01:11:00,875 --> 01:11:02,968
- Would you get him and bring back to me?
- Yes.

674
01:11:03,044 --> 01:11:04,375
You handle this here.

675
01:11:04,445 --> 01:11:05,707
Anything else you need?

676
01:11:11,586 --> 01:11:13,213
Hey, just a second.

677
01:11:15,023 --> 01:11:16,388
Turn off this light!

678
01:11:18,326 --> 01:11:21,659
Esther, I want you to meet
Ricky Vingo, K3SC, Seattle.

679
01:11:21,729 --> 01:11:23,526
Let's take it easy, all right?

680
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:27,565
- What name are you performing under?
- Wait a minute.

681
01:11:27,635 --> 01:11:28,659
What?

682
01:11:28,736 --> 01:11:31,136
- Ever think of changing the name?
- Why would I do that?

683
01:11:31,205 --> 01:11:34,402
I'd need a new driver's license,
stationery, Social Security number.

684
01:11:34,475 --> 01:11:35,669
It really would be a bother.

685
01:11:36,811 --> 01:11:38,676
Excuse me. Please. Excuse me.

686
01:11:38,746 --> 01:11:41,180
- Esther, we love you.
- You are beautiful.

687
01:11:45,553 --> 01:11:48,454
Out of the way!

688
01:11:52,193 --> 01:11:55,162
Esther, you're dynamite,
but get rid of the creep.

689
01:12:01,002 --> 01:12:02,162
What just happened?

690
01:12:02,770 --> 01:12:05,000
You did it! It's all yours, baby!

691
01:12:05,673 --> 01:12:06,799
Everything you want.

692
01:12:06,874 --> 01:12:09,240
Your own personal piece
of the American dream.

693
01:12:13,081 --> 01:12:15,515
It's not everything I want.
You know what I want?

694
01:12:15,617 --> 01:12:17,414
You know what it means, don't you?

695
01:12:17,852 --> 01:12:19,479
You're gonna be on the road.

696
01:12:20,521 --> 01:12:23,217
That's every cliché
you ever heard about it.

697
01:12:24,092 --> 01:12:26,925
You got your junk food
and your jailhouse tan.

698
01:12:28,296 --> 01:12:30,093
Lots of crazy strangers.

699
01:12:31,399 --> 01:12:34,061
It's a full-tilt boogie,
from motel to motel.

700
01:12:34,135 --> 01:12:35,363
I want to marry you.

701
01:12:38,139 --> 01:12:40,505
You got your basic meeting
with your basic mayor...

702
01:12:40,575 --> 01:12:44,204
you got the basic keys to the city,
only you don't know what city you're in.

703
01:12:44,278 --> 01:12:45,472
I want to marry you.

704
01:12:48,216 --> 01:12:49,444
No, you don't.

705
01:12:49,917 --> 01:12:52,442
I drink too much, I throw my money away.

706
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,654
I owe the government $180,000.

707
01:12:54,722 --> 01:12:57,020
- Don't you want to?
- That's not the point.

708
01:12:57,125 --> 01:12:59,093
So do I, so we should do it together.

709
01:12:59,327 --> 01:13:02,524
I never thought I'd get married again.
You'd be lucky to have me.

710
01:13:03,197 --> 01:13:05,062
It's not my luck I'm worried about.

711
01:13:08,102 --> 01:13:09,933
Shut up! We're talking here!

712
01:13:10,038 --> 01:13:11,437
I want you.

713
01:13:12,774 --> 01:13:15,504
What do you know what you want?
You been on two planes...

714
01:13:15,576 --> 01:13:17,134
I really do want you, Johnny.

715
01:13:22,917 --> 01:13:24,316
Don't bullshit me, Esther.

716
01:13:26,254 --> 01:13:27,778
I might start believing you.

717
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,697
John Norman Howard, do you take
this woman as your husband... wife?

718
01:13:42,937 --> 01:13:43,961
Excuse me.

719
01:13:44,038 --> 01:13:46,836
John Norman Howard, do you take
this woman as your wife?

720
01:13:46,908 --> 01:13:47,966
I do.

721
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:52,004
Esther Leona Hoffman, do you take
this man as your husband?

722
01:13:52,413 --> 01:13:55,678
Wait a minute. No. That's it?
That can't be. It's too short.

723
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:58,014
What about the "love, honor...

724
01:13:58,086 --> 01:14:00,987
"and obey till death do us part" part?

725
01:14:01,055 --> 01:14:03,148
Honey, this is what they tell us to say.

726
01:14:03,224 --> 01:14:05,852
If you want the long form
you have to do it in church.

727
01:14:05,927 --> 01:14:08,725
Anyway, "obey" is out,
the dawn of a new century.

728
01:14:08,996 --> 01:14:11,726
- Say "cherish," it's friendlier.
- That's okay.

729
01:14:11,899 --> 01:14:15,335
I'm already stretching this,
doing it out here instead of in my office.

730
01:14:15,403 --> 01:14:16,927
Are you gonna do it, or not?

731
01:14:17,438 --> 01:14:18,666
I'm gonna do it.

732
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:20,466
Me, too.

733
01:14:21,476 --> 01:14:23,671
- Me, too.
- Good.

734
01:14:24,078 --> 01:14:25,943
I now pronounce you man and wife.

735
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:47,892
- That's so funny.
- It's strange.

736
01:14:49,837 --> 01:14:53,238
All the people are looking.
We're married, stop that.

737
01:14:53,674 --> 01:14:55,938
This is a sample gift,
courtesy of the city.

738
01:14:56,010 --> 01:14:58,240
Let's get out of here
before we get arrested!

739
01:14:58,312 --> 01:15:00,780
I can't believe it!
What is this, a box of candy?

740
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:18,261
Pre-moistened handy wipes...

741
01:15:20,101 --> 01:15:23,867
fabric softener, stain remover...

742
01:15:24,505 --> 01:15:26,166
strawberry douche?

743
01:15:27,208 --> 01:15:30,177
- Everything for a perfect marriage kit!
- Strawberry douche?

744
01:15:31,579 --> 01:15:33,012
Unless you prefer apricot.

745
01:15:43,724 --> 01:15:44,884
Over there?

746
01:15:46,327 --> 01:15:47,316
Wait.

747
01:15:51,299 --> 01:15:52,823
How much further is it?

748
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:53,958
We are on it.

749
01:15:54,035 --> 01:15:56,128
- This is your farm?
- Ranch, Esther.

750
01:15:56,204 --> 01:15:58,798
This is your average 88,000-acre,
non-working ranch.

751
01:15:58,873 --> 01:16:00,704
You mean as far as I can see, you own it?

752
01:16:00,775 --> 01:16:03,005
You and I own it, babe,
community property.

753
01:16:03,644 --> 01:16:05,908
You and I,
and the First National Bank of Tucson...

754
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:08,642
and the Bankers Trust in Phoenix.

755
01:16:08,716 --> 01:16:10,911
Brian's got a second mortgage
in there somewhere.

756
01:16:10,985 --> 01:16:12,009
I bet he does.

757
01:16:12,086 --> 01:16:15,146
Outright, I think, you and I own
maybe a quarter of an acre.

758
01:16:15,456 --> 01:16:16,616
That's plenty.

759
01:16:21,095 --> 01:16:22,460
Look at the clouds.

760
01:16:24,832 --> 01:16:26,823
- Where's your ranch house?
- This is it.

761
01:16:26,901 --> 01:16:28,596
What do you mean, "this is it"?

762
01:16:28,803 --> 01:16:30,100
- This is it.
- Where?

763
01:16:30,538 --> 01:16:32,301
Hold it, let's do it right.

764
01:16:33,841 --> 01:16:35,468
This is getting to be a habit.

765
01:16:36,477 --> 01:16:37,967
I kind of like it.

766
01:16:38,913 --> 01:16:41,905
- This is the stone entrance way.
- Stone?

767
01:16:42,750 --> 01:16:44,274
Careful of those five steps.

768
01:16:45,219 --> 01:16:46,550
Thanks for telling me.

769
01:16:48,522 --> 01:16:51,013
- You're in the kitchen.
- The kitchen?

770
01:16:51,325 --> 01:16:53,657
- I thought you lived here.
- I do.

771
01:16:54,562 --> 01:16:55,961
It's just not finished yet.

772
01:16:56,898 --> 01:17:00,459
- How come you never finished it?
- I guess I never had a reason to.

773
01:17:03,471 --> 01:17:04,870
What do you think of it?

774
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:10,402
It's beautiful.

775
01:17:17,551 --> 01:17:20,418
- Where's the bedroom?
- You're standing in it.

776
01:17:23,257 --> 01:17:25,691
How convenient to put a kitchen
in the bedroom.

777
01:17:31,666 --> 01:17:34,464
Watch out. Wait a minute,
I'll get a blanket.

778
01:17:34,769 --> 01:17:36,794
You're gonna get stickers in your ass.

779
01:17:37,004 --> 01:17:38,562
I don't care.

780
01:17:38,906 --> 01:17:40,897
That's the spirit that built the West!

781
01:18:20,681 --> 01:18:21,875
Great place.

782
01:18:21,949 --> 01:18:23,746
We don't even have any floors yet!

783
01:18:23,985 --> 01:18:26,249
Look at this. Isn't that beautiful?

784
01:18:39,266 --> 01:18:40,756
Stop, don't!

785
01:18:46,273 --> 01:18:47,501
It's in my ear!

786
01:18:50,611 --> 01:18:51,805
I can't hear anything.

787
01:18:53,814 --> 01:18:55,281
I'm so sorry.

788
01:18:57,551 --> 01:19:01,351
- I'm drowning! You have to do first aid.
- Quick, aid, medic!

789
01:19:01,422 --> 01:19:03,788
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

790
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:06,621
I'm drowning, honey.

791
01:19:10,731 --> 01:19:12,995
I want you to always do
what you want, okay?

792
01:19:15,536 --> 01:19:18,027
You're so cute. You're fucking cute!

793
01:19:18,172 --> 01:19:20,868
Esther, I'm not cute.
I've told you not to call me cute.

794
01:19:20,941 --> 01:19:22,340
You are cute.

795
01:19:25,079 --> 01:19:27,070
You sure like whipped cream.

796
01:19:27,648 --> 01:19:29,411
Tastes much better that way, doesn't it?

797
01:19:29,683 --> 01:19:31,446
I love to watch you eat.

798
01:19:31,585 --> 01:19:33,177
I never seen anything like it.

799
01:19:33,254 --> 01:19:37,088
You put your whole heart and soul,
and back, and everything else into it.

800
01:19:37,391 --> 01:19:39,052
You just like me, don't you?

801
01:19:41,896 --> 01:19:43,056
Well, yes!

802
01:19:43,898 --> 01:19:45,661
Look what Brian gave us...

803
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,095
- for a wedding present.
- What did Brian get us?

804
01:19:48,169 --> 01:19:49,466
It appears to be...

805
01:19:49,537 --> 01:19:52,267
Look at this. We can do
our whole tour in trash-flash.

806
01:19:52,339 --> 01:19:54,603
I'll get you a matching
sequined guitar strap.

807
01:19:55,209 --> 01:19:57,302
Your tour, baby, not ours.

808
01:19:57,711 --> 01:20:01,044
A genuine, leather-bound,
hand-illustrated...

809
01:20:01,148 --> 01:20:04,140
<i>sixteenth-century edition
of the Kamasutra.</i>

810
01:20:04,618 --> 01:20:06,176
We could have used a toaster.

811
01:20:08,222 --> 01:20:09,314
What's that?

812
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:12,949
- Who would send us an empty bottle?
- Me.

813
01:20:14,261 --> 01:20:16,786
You like this? Look at this!
How would this look?

814
01:20:17,998 --> 01:20:19,795
It'll never work under the lights.

815
01:20:20,768 --> 01:20:22,963
I'm not gonna plan my life
around the lights.

816
01:20:23,137 --> 01:20:26,334
You are right now.
You haven't earned the right not to yet.

817
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,704
Crap! You know how I hate that attitude.

818
01:20:28,776 --> 01:20:31,745
You can tell me how to do it
and you won't do it yourself.

819
01:20:31,812 --> 01:20:34,007
I do not like this anymore than you do.

820
01:20:34,081 --> 01:20:35,912
Please do it with me.

821
01:20:37,017 --> 01:20:40,009
Please do the tour with me.
It would mean so much to me.

822
01:20:44,525 --> 01:20:45,787
You're a charmer...

823
01:20:46,327 --> 01:20:49,387
and you got a sweet little ass,
but I ain't going to.

824
01:20:51,932 --> 01:20:54,924
Either you do this tour with me,
or, God damn it, I won't do it.

825
01:20:55,002 --> 01:20:58,438
I'll stay home and bake bread.
We'll get fat and our teeth will fall out.

826
01:20:58,506 --> 01:21:01,771
That would be just great.
Because you're so good in the kitchen.

827
01:21:04,445 --> 01:21:05,434
Fucker.

828
01:21:18,559 --> 01:21:20,049
For God's sake.

829
01:21:27,334 --> 01:21:28,995
Love and cherish?

830
01:21:29,603 --> 01:21:33,300
How are you going to cherish me
in traction, you dumb bastard?

831
01:21:33,707 --> 01:21:35,641
Get yourself paralyzed
from the neck down...

832
01:21:35,709 --> 01:21:38,837
how you gonna think we are ever
gonna have a baby? Stop it!

833
01:21:41,215 --> 01:21:42,580
What are you doing?

834
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:44,345
Stop!

835
01:21:53,327 --> 01:21:54,760
John Norman!

836
01:22:03,834 --> 01:22:05,358
You son of a bitch!

837
01:22:05,536 --> 01:22:08,300
What did you do that to me for?
I thought you were dead!

838
01:22:08,672 --> 01:22:10,936
I'm too pretty to die!

839
01:22:12,409 --> 01:22:13,637
You pervert!

840
01:22:14,678 --> 01:22:16,578
Bullshit, what's wrong with you?

841
01:22:17,014 --> 01:22:19,983
You only feel alive when you're scaring
yourself half to death?

842
01:22:20,050 --> 01:22:22,211
Who was scared?
You were scared, I wasn't scared.

843
01:22:22,286 --> 01:22:23,947
You're such an asshole sometimes.

844
01:22:24,021 --> 01:22:25,010
Honestly!

845
01:22:26,056 --> 01:22:28,388
- Quit that.
- You knew that all the time.

846
01:22:30,060 --> 01:22:32,392
Life is so lousy with me,
you want to leave it?

847
01:22:32,463 --> 01:22:33,930
Hold still!

848
01:22:34,031 --> 01:22:36,158
No, I will not, I don't like hairy men!

849
01:22:37,635 --> 01:22:39,159
Look what you did to me!

850
01:22:40,938 --> 01:22:43,964
Then off it goes. How clumsy of me.

851
01:22:44,041 --> 01:22:46,703
- Off what goes?
- The beard, I'll cut it off!

852
01:22:47,077 --> 01:22:49,341
- What are you going to do?
- Cut her off.

853
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:52,073
What do you mean? Cut what off?
Come on back.

854
01:22:52,149 --> 01:22:53,673
You just keep wondering about it.

855
01:22:53,751 --> 01:22:55,548
Stop being like a nut!

856
01:22:56,887 --> 01:23:00,015
What are you going to do now?
How are you going to top that one?

857
01:23:00,357 --> 01:23:02,154
You're crazy, you're a damn fool.

858
01:23:02,292 --> 01:23:05,352
Stop it!
Come on, how would I recognize you?

859
01:23:05,462 --> 01:23:07,453
I don't know what you would look like.

860
01:23:07,531 --> 01:23:10,591
I might be very superficial
and not even like you anymore.

861
01:23:20,878 --> 01:23:22,903
Don't scare me anymore, Johnny.

862
01:23:24,181 --> 01:23:25,375
Just hold me.

863
01:23:29,353 --> 01:23:31,082
If you ever die, I'll kill you.

864
01:23:34,024 --> 01:23:35,685
I ain't never going to die.

865
01:23:37,928 --> 01:23:40,328
- Promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

866
01:23:50,274 --> 01:23:54,005
- Hell, I'll go on your goddamn tour.
- Really?

867
01:23:55,512 --> 01:23:56,945
I love you!

868
01:24:23,006 --> 01:24:26,237
Do you realize how long it's been
since you've seen anybody but me?

869
01:24:26,376 --> 01:24:27,741
Yeah, and I love it.

870
01:24:27,978 --> 01:24:30,674
It gives the day a focus.
I wake up looking at you.

871
01:24:30,748 --> 01:24:33,808
I go to sleep looking at you.
It's simple and I can handle it.

872
01:24:37,254 --> 01:24:38,346
Oh, no!

873
01:24:39,189 --> 01:24:40,178
Shit.

874
01:24:43,727 --> 01:24:44,716
God!

875
01:24:48,432 --> 01:24:51,731
<i>Esther looks great and happy.
I'm happy for her and I'm happy for you.</i>

876
01:24:51,935 --> 01:24:54,426
Brian, what did you bring me
out here to say?

877
01:24:54,505 --> 01:24:56,666
You seem like somebody I knew
a long time ago.

878
01:24:56,740 --> 01:24:57,729
It's nice.

879
01:24:59,510 --> 01:25:02,343
You don't want me going out
on the road with her, right?

880
01:25:02,412 --> 01:25:05,279
John, remember, I'm talking to you
as a man who loves you.

881
01:25:05,449 --> 01:25:07,849
Esther's got her own music
and her own public.

882
01:25:07,918 --> 01:25:11,376
They want her, you they're suing.
She shouldn't have to pick up on that.

883
01:25:12,890 --> 01:25:14,482
Jeez, don't beat around the bush.

884
01:25:14,558 --> 01:25:17,618
Tell me what you feel about me
going out on tour with that lady.

885
01:25:17,694 --> 01:25:20,219
- Can you take it?
- Certainly I can take it.

886
01:25:20,531 --> 01:25:22,192
You blew it.

887
01:25:22,733 --> 01:25:25,566
Your songs don't work.
You're causing people a lot of trouble.

888
01:25:25,636 --> 01:25:27,536
- People are getting hurt.
- I was wrong...

889
01:25:27,604 --> 01:25:29,333
Her single's Number 6 with a bullet.

890
01:25:29,473 --> 01:25:32,067
She's up for a Grammy,
she's ready to fly on her own.

891
01:25:32,442 --> 01:25:33,875
Let her go, John.

892
01:25:35,546 --> 01:25:37,605
Think you're telling me
something I don't know?

893
01:25:37,681 --> 01:25:39,114
I've been trying to tell her that.

894
01:25:40,951 --> 01:25:43,511
I know our music doesn't even belong
on the same stage...

895
01:25:43,587 --> 01:25:45,521
but she doesn't want to do it on her own.

896
01:25:45,622 --> 01:25:47,590
Maybe you could produce her tour.

897
01:25:49,226 --> 01:25:51,456
I can't even keep a bank account, man.

898
01:25:52,629 --> 01:25:53,994
You might enjoy it.

899
01:25:54,998 --> 01:25:56,761
Me and the boys
are getting back together.

900
01:25:56,834 --> 01:25:58,301
We got some new stuff.

901
01:25:58,368 --> 01:25:59,960
Better than anything you ever heard.

902
01:26:00,037 --> 01:26:01,026
You're gonna love it.

903
01:26:02,506 --> 01:26:03,973
John, about Esther...

904
01:26:04,041 --> 01:26:06,839
All right. I will tell her.
Don't worry about it, Brian.

905
01:26:07,578 --> 01:26:09,705
- Great!
- I don't want to laugh.

906
01:26:09,813 --> 01:26:11,906
Don't laugh. That's great!

907
01:26:11,982 --> 01:26:13,973
Serious? Perfect.

908
01:26:14,051 --> 01:26:15,450
- Then what?
- Do seedy.

909
01:26:15,519 --> 01:26:16,884
Now I'm in trouble.

910
01:26:17,988 --> 01:26:19,285
Esther sings.

911
01:26:19,356 --> 01:26:21,415
I'm tired, can I get off this bar stool?

912
01:26:21,491 --> 01:26:24,460
- Sure, give me a chance to reload.
- Just take a little break.

913
01:26:25,329 --> 01:26:27,160
- How are you doing down there?
- Fine.

914
01:26:28,265 --> 01:26:31,496
Freddie? I want you to come outside
and look at this goddamn view.

915
01:26:31,635 --> 01:26:33,796
I already saw it, thanks a lot.

916
01:26:33,871 --> 01:26:36,533
Out here, Freddie.
You won't believe it, come.

917
01:26:37,608 --> 01:26:40,236
- Like it?
- I love it!

918
01:26:43,947 --> 01:26:46,347
I got a terrific idea
for the middle of the set!

919
01:26:47,017 --> 01:26:48,848
I was gonna talk to you about that.

920
01:26:48,986 --> 01:26:50,817
Sorry I'm taking so long, Esther...

921
01:26:50,888 --> 01:26:54,221
I was gonna have an assistant,
but I was afraid it'd spoil the mood.

922
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:55,349
You changed your mind.

923
01:26:55,459 --> 01:26:58,758
When I photograph someone
for the first time, it's got to be perfect.

924
01:26:58,862 --> 01:27:02,764
- You're not gonna do the tour.
- I've been thinking a lot about that...

925
01:27:04,234 --> 01:27:07,362
I think it's right that you should go out
and do it by yourself.

926
01:27:07,437 --> 01:27:09,132
If I'm on a bill...

927
01:27:09,473 --> 01:27:13,000
- they can say I'm carrying you.
- Since when do you care what people say?

928
01:27:13,577 --> 01:27:15,374
I care what they say about you.

929
01:27:15,545 --> 01:27:18,412
Esther, relax. Your face, my God,
this light is fantastic.

930
01:27:18,482 --> 01:27:21,178
I don't want do it alone.
I am scared of going public.

931
01:27:21,752 --> 01:27:23,185
You're already gone, babe.

932
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:24,509
Esther.

933
01:27:26,123 --> 01:27:27,112
Beautiful.

934
01:27:43,941 --> 01:27:46,569
What do you think about
the reviews on your new album?

935
01:27:46,643 --> 01:27:49,168
- I haven't read them.
- They're selling like crazy.

936
01:27:49,246 --> 01:27:51,077
I heard some are good...

937
01:27:51,148 --> 01:27:54,379
my manager tells me some are terrible,
I don't really care.

938
01:27:54,451 --> 01:27:57,420
I don't go into a studio
and say I'm gonna cut a hit record.

939
01:27:57,487 --> 01:27:59,318
I just cut songs I like.

940
01:28:14,037 --> 01:28:16,597
She's able to handle it pretty good.
Better than I would.

941
01:28:51,441 --> 01:28:53,409
Johnny, I wish I could go with you.

942
01:28:53,477 --> 01:28:56,605
When you finish your TV thing,
you can come on the road with us.

943
01:28:56,680 --> 01:29:00,207
Listen, darling, you've never heard
the Speedway when we're really cooking.

944
01:29:00,317 --> 01:29:03,411
- You're gonna be proud of me.
- I am proud of you already, Johnny.

945
01:29:07,190 --> 01:29:09,681
What am I gonna do without you
for six whole hours?

946
01:29:12,896 --> 01:29:14,124
I'll write you.

947
01:29:16,266 --> 01:29:17,460
Okay, I got to go.

948
01:29:18,168 --> 01:29:19,260
Okay.

949
01:29:24,641 --> 01:29:26,108
Give the guys a hug for me.

950
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:30,473
I miss you already.

951
01:29:35,452 --> 01:29:37,943
- Esther.
- What?

952
01:29:43,293 --> 01:29:45,853
- What's the matter?
- I was just taking another look.

953
01:29:48,331 --> 01:29:49,593
You're crazy.

954
01:30:14,624 --> 01:30:16,421
It's Amelia Earhart.

955
01:30:19,362 --> 01:30:20,522
What's all this?

956
01:30:20,597 --> 01:30:21,996
Did you hear any of that?

957
01:30:22,532 --> 01:30:25,092
- What is it?
- That's Freeway.

958
01:30:25,168 --> 01:30:28,069
That's your new album,
it's gonna be released in three weeks.

959
01:30:28,138 --> 01:30:30,072
We're still cutting basic tracks.

960
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:32,701
Nothing changes but the changes, slick.

961
01:30:33,176 --> 01:30:34,370
Freeway?

962
01:30:34,744 --> 01:30:36,837
Last I heard it was the Speedway.

963
01:30:37,013 --> 01:30:40,471
Then I guess you haven't heard.
They're the hottest thing since Tabasco.

964
01:30:44,721 --> 01:30:46,188
When did all this happen?

965
01:30:46,456 --> 01:30:47,582
Survival.

966
01:30:48,892 --> 01:30:50,519
We thought you retired, slick.

967
01:30:51,361 --> 01:30:52,953
Now that the old lady's working...

968
01:30:53,029 --> 01:30:56,863
can't expect these guys to sit around
while you're out lollygagging...

969
01:30:56,933 --> 01:30:58,332
in the desert with Esther.

970
01:30:59,136 --> 01:31:02,697
They got a single chasing up the charts
right now, Number 5 with a bullet.

971
01:31:02,772 --> 01:31:04,740
Don't you ever listen to your radio?

972
01:31:05,108 --> 01:31:07,906
I had my radio turned off
for about a minute.

973
01:31:08,245 --> 01:31:09,837
Gotta get some more of that.

974
01:31:12,048 --> 01:31:14,881
- Come on outside with me.
- Bring that up, Lou.

975
01:31:16,253 --> 01:31:18,221
Is your old lady on the road, or what?

976
01:31:18,388 --> 01:31:20,754
She had to stop the tour
for that television thing.

977
01:31:20,991 --> 01:31:22,891
You're not gonna believe this.

978
01:31:23,193 --> 01:31:27,425
All the way over here, I've been trying
to think how I was gonna tell you all...

979
01:31:27,597 --> 01:31:29,929
- about this thing I got to do.
- What? Tell me.

980
01:31:30,033 --> 01:31:31,466
But it's perfect now.

981
01:31:31,801 --> 01:31:35,931
They want me to go out on the road.
They want me alone, without Speedway...

982
01:31:36,573 --> 01:31:38,973
with some new material. It's good.

983
01:31:39,509 --> 01:31:41,773
But it's different.
It's a different sound, you see.

984
01:31:41,845 --> 01:31:43,506
I have been working...

985
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:46,048
with these couple
of young punks I found...

986
01:31:46,249 --> 01:31:49,116
in a club out there in some canyon,
and they're hungry...

987
01:31:49,319 --> 01:31:51,981
and they love my stuff, man,
and it's exciting.

988
01:31:52,923 --> 01:31:54,652
That's good, I'm glad.

989
01:31:54,724 --> 01:31:56,248
What time is it anyway, man?

990
01:31:56,927 --> 01:31:59,225
I don't know... Come in here a minute.

991
01:31:59,296 --> 01:32:00,923
- Got a rehearsal.
- No. Come on.

992
01:32:01,064 --> 01:32:04,659
I can't do it. Would you tell them
I like what they are doing?

993
01:32:06,069 --> 01:32:08,469
- I love you, brother.
- And I love you, man.

994
01:33:33,723 --> 01:33:35,953
Can somebody pick that up out there?

995
01:33:47,137 --> 01:33:48,195
Hello?

996
01:33:49,439 --> 01:33:54,342
Yes, this is 652-1652.
No, she isn't in here now.

997
01:33:56,313 --> 01:33:58,338
No, this isn't her secretary.

998
01:34:01,484 --> 01:34:03,543
No, this isn't her answering service.

999
01:34:04,888 --> 01:34:05,980
Yeah, bye.

1000
01:34:45,862 --> 01:34:48,888
God damn it!
Pick up the phone out there!

1001
01:34:51,868 --> 01:34:53,096
Hoffman residence.

1002
01:34:54,637 --> 01:34:56,264
No, she isn't here yet.

1003
01:34:58,108 --> 01:34:59,973
All right, I'll tell her. Yes.

1004
01:35:29,139 --> 01:35:30,299
John Norman?

1005
01:35:31,374 --> 01:35:32,500
Over here.

1006
01:35:33,943 --> 01:35:35,103
Hi!

1007
01:35:36,446 --> 01:35:37,743
How did it go?

1008
01:35:38,314 --> 01:35:39,872
God, it's dark in here.

1009
01:35:40,617 --> 01:35:42,346
How can you work in the dark?

1010
01:35:45,021 --> 01:35:46,921
Tell me. I can't wait to hear.

1011
01:35:47,190 --> 01:35:48,851
What happened with the guys?

1012
01:35:49,993 --> 01:35:52,291
Do you know
when you are going out with them?

1013
01:35:52,395 --> 01:35:54,454
I'll be your groupie, if you'll be mine.

1014
01:35:54,697 --> 01:35:56,688
- Did you play your stuff for them?
- No.

1015
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,126
Why not?

1016
01:35:58,768 --> 01:36:01,236
I don't even know
where their heads are right now.

1017
01:36:01,304 --> 01:36:04,034
They're into something new
that I can't get next to.

1018
01:36:04,107 --> 01:36:06,371
I hope they know
what the hell they are doing.

1019
01:36:06,476 --> 01:36:08,740
You're not gonna go on tour with them?

1020
01:36:08,845 --> 01:36:11,746
I don't want to talk about that crap,
I want to talk about you.

1021
01:36:11,815 --> 01:36:13,476
How did it go today?

1022
01:36:15,318 --> 01:36:18,287
They hire me and they want to change
everything about me.

1023
01:36:19,088 --> 01:36:22,455
I'm too short for the costumes,
I'm too tall for the men...

1024
01:36:22,926 --> 01:36:25,622
I'm too loud for the songs,
too quiet for the jokes.

1025
01:36:26,729 --> 01:36:28,321
I don't know what they want.

1026
01:36:28,965 --> 01:36:30,762
You just stick to your guns.

1027
01:36:32,702 --> 01:36:34,135
I'm sticking with you.

1028
01:36:35,438 --> 01:36:38,999
- You tired?
- Yeah. I'm starving.

1029
01:36:40,276 --> 01:36:43,643
So am I. I want some beer and a pickle.

1030
01:36:45,682 --> 01:36:49,413
I want some oysters and Greek olives.

1031
01:36:52,555 --> 01:36:54,113
Let's have a picnic in bed.

1032
01:36:56,125 --> 01:36:57,251
Good idea.

1033
01:36:57,594 --> 01:37:01,291
I'll bring up some peanut butter and jelly
and unfiltered honey.

1034
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:04,831
God damn it!

1035
01:37:04,934 --> 01:37:08,768
- Forget it. Just don't answer it.
- It's probably for you.

1036
01:37:08,905 --> 01:37:11,533
I don't care, just let it ring,
maybe they'll go away.

1037
01:37:11,608 --> 01:37:15,203
Which reminds me. Jameson wants you
to do an interview show on the 12th.

1038
01:37:15,712 --> 01:37:20,115
You've a wardrobe fitting and an insurance
examination on the day after tomorrow.

1039
01:37:20,183 --> 01:37:22,344
Johnny, I don't want to talk about it now.

1040
01:37:22,418 --> 01:37:25,581
Let me finish it before I forget.
You gotta have...

1041
01:37:25,989 --> 01:37:28,514
They want to know how many
places you want at the...

1042
01:37:29,125 --> 01:37:31,059
table at the Grammy Awards.

1043
01:37:32,095 --> 01:37:34,154
And two hang ups.

1044
01:37:36,032 --> 01:37:38,899
Who said that the booze and the dope
would ruin your brain?

1045
01:37:39,669 --> 01:37:41,796
Your memory ain't your liver anyway,
is it?

1046
01:37:45,575 --> 01:37:47,543
I'm gonna make a drink, you want some?

1047
01:37:47,744 --> 01:37:49,541
What happened today, Johnny?

1048
01:37:51,447 --> 01:37:53,108
Why don't we talk about it?

1049
01:37:55,051 --> 01:37:56,177
Johnny?

1050
01:37:59,789 --> 01:38:02,121
<i>And now to present
this year's Grammy Award...</i>

1051
01:38:02,191 --> 01:38:04,455
<i>for the Best Performance
by a Female Artist...</i>

1052
01:38:04,527 --> 01:38:06,825
<i>here are Rita Coolidge and Tony Orlando!</i>

1053
01:38:13,136 --> 01:38:14,831
<i>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen!</i>

1054
01:38:15,071 --> 01:38:18,507
<i>This is the year where the have-nots,
once again, give to the haves.</i>

1055
01:38:18,575 --> 01:38:21,305
<i>The winner is going to have
to fight me off to get this.</i>

1056
01:38:21,377 --> 01:38:24,437
<i>Spoons, forks, guns, knives,
it makes no difference.</i>

1057
01:38:25,748 --> 01:38:26,942
<i>Yes, indeed.</i>

1058
01:38:27,917 --> 01:38:31,409
<i>In fact, I wonder who the lucky person is.
I hope they don't outweigh me.</i>

1059
01:38:32,589 --> 01:38:33,954
You're a shoo-in.

1060
01:38:34,023 --> 01:38:35,581
Brian, I gotta leave.

1061
01:38:35,658 --> 01:38:37,626
He's probably stuck in traffic.

1062
01:38:37,694 --> 01:38:40,857
Bullshit, you know better.
He probably forgot. I got to go find him.

1063
01:38:40,930 --> 01:38:44,866
<i>The winner for the Best Performance
by a Female Artist is Esther Hoffman!</i>

1064
01:39:15,098 --> 01:39:16,258
<i>Thank you.</i>

1065
01:39:17,533 --> 01:39:20,058
<i>I tell you,
this one caught me by surprise...</i>

1066
01:39:21,704 --> 01:39:24,002
<i>I really didn't plan on winning it...</i>

1067
01:39:24,807 --> 01:39:27,640
<i>but I did prepare a little something,
just in case, you know?</i>

1068
01:39:29,345 --> 01:39:32,246
<i>The problem is I wrote it
on the tablecloth over there.</i>

1069
01:39:32,315 --> 01:39:35,011
<i>So you're gonna have to read it
to me or something.</i>

1070
01:39:35,084 --> 01:39:38,053
<i>No, to make this as brief as possible...</i>

1071
01:39:39,455 --> 01:39:41,946
<i>there are two people
that I would really like to thank.</i>

1072
01:39:42,025 --> 01:39:43,049
Table six.

1073
01:39:43,126 --> 01:39:46,721
<i>The first one
is Abraham Burakovski, who...</i>

1074
01:39:46,796 --> 01:39:48,923
What do you say, let's go outside,
get some air.

1075
01:39:48,998 --> 01:39:51,398
Let go of my goddamn arm.

1076
01:39:51,467 --> 01:39:53,367
Let go of my arm.

1077
01:39:53,469 --> 01:39:55,699
Christ! I'm sorry, baby,
I can't find my place.

1078
01:39:55,772 --> 01:39:58,002
They don't seem to have a place
for me down here.

1079
01:39:58,074 --> 01:40:01,635
<i>The second one is here with us tonight.</i>

1080
01:40:01,711 --> 01:40:03,645
<i>John Norman Howard.</i>

1081
01:40:03,746 --> 01:40:05,680
Don't do that.

1082
01:40:06,315 --> 01:40:08,044
Not to me anyway.

1083
01:40:08,785 --> 01:40:10,810
At least don't do it to me.

1084
01:40:12,422 --> 01:40:15,118
You did something all by yourself
and it was good.

1085
01:40:15,558 --> 01:40:19,790
You don't owe anybody a goddamn thing
for that, not me, and certainly not them.

1086
01:40:20,496 --> 01:40:21,861
You don't have to thank them...

1087
01:40:21,931 --> 01:40:24,661
for the privilege of giving them
something good.

1088
01:40:24,734 --> 01:40:26,634
I missed you all day, baby.

1089
01:40:27,303 --> 01:40:28,793
You're blowing your act.

1090
01:40:28,871 --> 01:40:30,236
I'm blowing whose act?

1091
01:40:30,306 --> 01:40:32,001
<i>Good night, everyone, thank you.</i>

1092
01:40:33,676 --> 01:40:35,405
<i>Wait, you forgot your thing...</i>

1093
01:40:35,478 --> 01:40:37,446
<i>for best performance.</i>

1094
01:40:39,749 --> 01:40:41,842
<i>Which is what it's all about, ain't it?</i>

1095
01:40:42,518 --> 01:40:45,248
<i>What about the one you got
for the worst performance?</i>

1096
01:40:48,357 --> 01:40:50,018
<i>You all know I deserve it.</i>

1097
01:40:51,627 --> 01:40:54,152
<i>And, God knows, I couldn't have
done it without you.</i>

1098
01:40:54,230 --> 01:40:55,720
Get him off the stage.

1099
01:40:55,832 --> 01:40:58,767
<i>Anyway, I work hard for it,
and I want it!</i>

1100
01:40:59,368 --> 01:41:00,960
<i>So where the fuck is it?</i>

1101
01:41:02,004 --> 01:41:04,404
<i>Let me see the worst thing
you got to offer...</i>

1102
01:41:04,607 --> 01:41:06,438
<i>for the worst I got to offer!</i>

1103
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:09,740
<i>You know, I'd really like to rub salt
in your ass?</i>

1104
01:41:10,213 --> 01:41:13,046
<i>The Grammy Awards will continue
after this commercial message.</i>

1105
01:41:13,149 --> 01:41:14,673
Who the hell is Burakovski?

1106
01:41:19,088 --> 01:41:20,248
I'm okay!

1107
01:41:20,323 --> 01:41:24,089
...managed to upstage his Grammy
Award-winning wife, Esther Hoffman.

1108
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:25,559
You're an ass!

1109
01:41:25,628 --> 01:41:26,720
Keep the lights on them!

1110
01:41:26,796 --> 01:41:28,024
Out of the way!

1111
01:41:28,531 --> 01:41:30,396
Keep them in the shot. Go. Follow them.

1112
01:41:30,466 --> 01:41:32,696
Put the lights on it.
Get a shot of that.

1113
01:41:33,169 --> 01:41:35,069
We're catching all the action for you!

1114
01:41:35,138 --> 01:41:38,164
Mr. Jesus Christ Superstar
just belted out his new champion.

1115
01:41:38,241 --> 01:41:40,903
Tarzan, how does it feel
to uncork on the old lady?

1116
01:41:42,678 --> 01:41:43,804
Johnny!

1117
01:41:44,781 --> 01:41:45,941
You see it?

1118
01:41:46,282 --> 01:41:47,476
What are you doing?

1119
01:41:47,950 --> 01:41:49,349
He's trying to kill me!

1120
01:41:51,454 --> 01:41:52,443
Stop it.

1121
01:41:52,922 --> 01:41:54,890
Shut off your goddamn lights!

1122
01:41:55,057 --> 01:41:56,957
When is it ever enough?

1123
01:41:57,860 --> 01:41:59,452
Don't you ever have enough?

1124
01:42:07,603 --> 01:42:10,504
What are you gonna do for an encore,
set yourself on fire?

1125
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:14,468
What is it?
Don't you know how good you are?

1126
01:42:15,611 --> 01:42:17,238
What is it? Is it me?

1127
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:20,105
Am I doing something wrong?

1128
01:42:26,422 --> 01:42:28,253
I love you, Johnny.

1129
01:42:29,926 --> 01:42:31,553
But it's not enough, is it?

1130
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:59,410
I'm sorry, I can't...

1131
01:43:00,456 --> 01:43:01,718
This is ridiculous.

1132
01:43:02,058 --> 01:43:03,389
Wait a minute. Hold on.

1133
01:43:03,659 --> 01:43:06,150
Can you hold the playback, please?

1134
01:43:07,363 --> 01:43:11,094
I can't walk when I'm singing down
the steps. I mean, I'll kill myself.

1135
01:43:14,070 --> 01:43:17,369
Could you please stop the playback?
In rehearsal, we...

1136
01:43:19,375 --> 01:43:22,071
In rehearsal there was white tape
on the floor...

1137
01:43:22,144 --> 01:43:24,271
I guess it was supposed to be the steps...

1138
01:43:24,347 --> 01:43:27,680
but anyway, actually, it comes
in a very important part of my lyric.

1139
01:43:27,750 --> 01:43:30,344
Why don't I just stand there
and sing the song?

1140
01:43:30,419 --> 01:43:34,116
I'm not trying to be difficult or anything,
I'm just trying to get it right.

1141
01:43:35,858 --> 01:43:36,950
Hello?

1142
01:43:39,028 --> 01:43:40,586
Anybody hear me?

1143
01:43:42,131 --> 01:43:44,998
What's wrong?
What's going on down there?

1144
01:43:45,134 --> 01:43:46,999
- I don't know, let me check!
- Hi.

1145
01:43:48,371 --> 01:43:50,339
Can we take a break, please?

1146
01:43:50,907 --> 01:43:54,035
Roll it back, five minutes, everyone!

1147
01:43:54,110 --> 01:43:56,101
<i>- Fucking star...
- Your mike's on.</i>

1148
01:43:56,178 --> 01:43:57,304
<i>Sorry.</i>

1149
01:43:57,880 --> 01:43:59,939
- You want a Valium?
- Not yet.

1150
01:44:00,549 --> 01:44:02,813
- How's it going?
- Fine.

1151
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:04,279
How is he?

1152
01:44:05,021 --> 01:44:06,989
The same. I fly out to him on weekends.

1153
01:44:07,056 --> 01:44:10,492
And he pretends that it is okay,
you know, for a day or so.

1154
01:44:10,559 --> 01:44:12,584
Then I pretend I don't notice
he's pretending.

1155
01:44:12,662 --> 01:44:14,562
- Ms. Hoffman?
- Hoffman.

1156
01:44:14,630 --> 01:44:16,063
- That's what I said.
- What?

1157
01:44:16,132 --> 01:44:18,327
We have a little problem
with your reflection.

1158
01:44:18,401 --> 01:44:20,164
We'll deal with it in a moment.

1159
01:44:20,236 --> 01:44:22,329
- All right.
- I will be with you shortly.

1160
01:44:22,438 --> 01:44:25,896
I just can't do it anymore,
Brian. I just...

1161
01:44:27,143 --> 01:44:29,668
I get on a plane,
I lock myself in the bathroom...

1162
01:44:29,745 --> 01:44:32,305
and I scream
all the way from Tucson to L.A.

1163
01:44:34,116 --> 01:44:37,244
Sometimes, I look at him
when he's sleeping...

1164
01:44:38,688 --> 01:44:39,950
and he...

1165
01:44:40,923 --> 01:44:44,120
He has no pain in his face, no hurt.

1166
01:44:44,994 --> 01:44:46,256
He's so beautiful.

1167
01:44:46,696 --> 01:44:49,062
Can we see wardrobe in the booth,
right away, please?

1168
01:44:49,131 --> 01:44:50,655
And I wish I could just...

1169
01:44:50,933 --> 01:44:54,061
wake him up and have him stay that way.

1170
01:44:54,770 --> 01:44:56,931
Calm, peaceful.

1171
01:44:59,108 --> 01:45:01,099
He's been writing songs, you know.

1172
01:45:01,177 --> 01:45:04,044
- Has he talked to you about them?
- No, he doesn't call me.

1173
01:45:04,413 --> 01:45:07,576
Why don't you call him for Christ's sake,
what are you waiting for?

1174
01:45:07,650 --> 01:45:10,210
You're supposed to be his oldest friend.
What is it?

1175
01:45:10,286 --> 01:45:12,015
We have to check your light reflection.

1176
01:45:12,088 --> 01:45:15,080
- When I finish talking to Mr. Wexler...
- Thank you.

1177
01:45:15,224 --> 01:45:17,488
- Thank you very much.
- Okay, thank you.

1178
01:45:17,626 --> 01:45:18,820
He is my oldest friend.

1179
01:45:18,894 --> 01:45:22,022
He made me rich, turned my life around,
I can't do any more for him.

1180
01:45:22,098 --> 01:45:23,622
That sucks, Brian.

1181
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,935
There's a lot you can do for him.
You can give him your time.

1182
01:45:27,003 --> 01:45:29,631
You can give him your support,
you can earn your 25%...

1183
01:45:29,705 --> 01:45:32,299
Let's not justify this.
I am as good a friend as you are.

1184
01:45:32,375 --> 01:45:33,467
I am not in love with him.

1185
01:45:33,542 --> 01:45:35,806
I don't have to believe something
that's not true...

1186
01:45:35,878 --> 01:45:37,277
Don't say that, don't...

1187
01:45:38,881 --> 01:45:41,281
- Don't say that, Brian.
- We're ready, Ms. Hoffman.

1188
01:45:42,084 --> 01:45:44,245
These songs...

1189
01:45:45,021 --> 01:45:46,818
that he's writing are really good.

1190
01:45:46,889 --> 01:45:48,288
I mean, they're not what...

1191
01:45:48,591 --> 01:45:50,786
you're used to hearing but they're really...

1192
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:51,884
- fine.
- Well...

1193
01:45:52,028 --> 01:45:53,495
let me go listen to them...

1194
01:45:53,662 --> 01:45:55,425
let me hear them, and we'll see.

1195
01:45:55,498 --> 01:45:56,487
We'll see.

1196
01:45:56,565 --> 01:45:59,033
It makes me angry
that I have to pitch you like this...

1197
01:45:59,101 --> 01:46:00,659
that I have to sell you, make you go.

1198
01:46:00,736 --> 01:46:01,725
- Come on.
- Why not go?

1199
01:46:01,804 --> 01:46:04,398
You don't have to pitch me,
sell me, or ask me.

1200
01:46:04,507 --> 01:46:06,065
I'll go. If they're good...

1201
01:46:06,675 --> 01:46:08,643
I'll record them.
I will record them, okay?

1202
01:46:09,412 --> 01:46:10,401
Okay.

1203
01:46:13,349 --> 01:46:15,180
I would appreciate that, Brian.

1204
01:46:15,484 --> 01:46:17,349
We're all waiting, Ms. Hoffman.

1205
01:46:18,821 --> 01:46:19,913
Thank you, John.

1206
01:46:20,823 --> 01:46:21,915
I like the songs.

1207
01:46:24,493 --> 01:46:25,482
You do?

1208
01:46:27,563 --> 01:46:28,552
Yeah.

1209
01:46:34,336 --> 01:46:35,701
Bull squash, Brian.

1210
01:46:36,806 --> 01:46:40,333
You got a different sound there, John,
a different sound altogether.

1211
01:46:41,177 --> 01:46:43,805
I think we gotta give them
some of your golden oldies.

1212
01:46:43,879 --> 01:46:45,870
Stuff that made you a household word.

1213
01:46:46,082 --> 01:46:48,141
I'll fix it, no favors.
I'll make a mint.

1214
01:46:48,217 --> 01:46:51,345
You're new stuff is good,
I'll record it if you want.

1215
01:46:51,487 --> 01:46:53,751
But I don't think they'll buy
what they don't know.

1216
01:46:53,989 --> 01:46:55,752
I appreciate what you're doing...

1217
01:46:55,858 --> 01:46:58,486
but you can't have them songs anyway.
I want them.

1218
01:46:58,627 --> 01:47:01,289
- I wanna start my own label.
- That's good.

1219
01:47:01,397 --> 01:47:03,524
I'm getting too damn old for this road...

1220
01:47:04,366 --> 01:47:06,493
and I wanna be a mogul like you.

1221
01:47:07,203 --> 01:47:08,636
Live off everybody else.

1222
01:47:42,505 --> 01:47:43,529
Who are you?

1223
01:47:44,406 --> 01:47:45,395
Quentin.

1224
01:47:46,742 --> 01:47:47,731
Remember?

1225
01:47:48,677 --> 01:47:50,804
I used to be with Gary Danziger.

1226
01:47:51,013 --> 01:47:52,241
Oh, that Quentin.

1227
01:47:54,650 --> 01:47:55,742
How did you get in?

1228
01:47:56,252 --> 01:47:58,015
I came in with the pool man.

1229
01:48:00,122 --> 01:48:01,680
Guess how long I've had this.

1230
01:48:01,757 --> 01:48:03,520
Since Gary Danziger, I bet.

1231
01:48:05,461 --> 01:48:07,156
I was with him for a week.

1232
01:48:07,663 --> 01:48:10,097
It was a meaningful relationship.

1233
01:48:11,100 --> 01:48:12,965
Listen, you could help me out.

1234
01:48:14,069 --> 01:48:16,060
How about the same way you got in?

1235
01:48:16,138 --> 01:48:17,730
Listen, I'd like an interview.

1236
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:20,968
<i>I string for Rolling Stone
and all the pop magazines.</i>

1237
01:48:21,810 --> 01:48:24,176
An exclusive interview.

1238
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:25,606
I bet you would.

1239
01:48:26,382 --> 01:48:27,747
This is far out.

1240
01:48:29,151 --> 01:48:30,379
Out of sight!

1241
01:48:31,654 --> 01:48:33,144
Blows the mind.

1242
01:48:33,389 --> 01:48:35,380
Boy, you really have a way with words.

1243
01:48:35,691 --> 01:48:37,556
I can't wait to see what you write.

1244
01:48:37,693 --> 01:48:40,127
Please.
I'd do anything for this interview.

1245
01:48:40,462 --> 01:48:42,157
You can ask Gary what I'd do.

1246
01:48:42,965 --> 01:48:44,296
I'm sure he'd tell me.

1247
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:48,094
Gary says I'm terrific.
He really gets off on me.

1248
01:48:50,072 --> 01:48:52,233
Gary's been known to say things like that.

1249
01:48:52,675 --> 01:48:54,336
I'd really like this interview.

1250
01:48:56,212 --> 01:48:57,201
Far out.

1251
01:48:58,881 --> 01:48:59,870
Exclusive.

1252
01:49:00,849 --> 01:49:01,838
Out of sight.

1253
01:49:03,719 --> 01:49:04,708
With Esther.

1254
01:49:08,991 --> 01:49:09,980
Perfect.

1255
01:49:18,567 --> 01:49:19,556
He's home!

1256
01:49:20,269 --> 01:49:21,258
Fantastic.

1257
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:26,234
John Norman!

1258
01:49:27,876 --> 01:49:28,865
You're back.

1259
01:49:51,500 --> 01:49:53,229
She wants an interview with you.

1260
01:49:54,003 --> 01:49:54,992
Yeah.

1261
01:49:55,971 --> 01:49:56,960
Far out, huh?

1262
01:49:57,473 --> 01:49:58,963
I'll get my tape recorder.

1263
01:49:59,942 --> 01:50:01,375
This means so much to me.

1264
01:50:02,244 --> 01:50:04,212
This is terrific. Give me a minute.

1265
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:06,272
I'll get this tape recorder.

1266
01:50:07,116 --> 01:50:08,413
I don't know, this is amazing.

1267
01:50:08,951 --> 01:50:10,578
I'm really excited.

1268
01:50:11,287 --> 01:50:12,686
Okay, now wait a minute.

1269
01:50:12,921 --> 01:50:14,582
Get this tape recorder on here.

1270
01:50:15,024 --> 01:50:16,013
Okay.

1271
01:50:16,825 --> 01:50:17,814
Go!

1272
01:50:25,701 --> 01:50:28,693
What's the matter with her?
Is she gonna talk to me, or what?

1273
01:50:29,938 --> 01:50:31,235
I did my part.

1274
01:50:35,844 --> 01:50:37,641
You dirty son of a bitch!

1275
01:50:38,314 --> 01:50:39,303
All right, get out.

1276
01:50:39,481 --> 01:50:42,939
- What do you mean, get out?
- I mean, get out!

1277
01:50:43,052 --> 01:50:44,986
The hell with you, man.

1278
01:50:48,257 --> 01:50:49,246
Listen...

1279
01:50:49,925 --> 01:50:51,415
he couldn't make it anyway.

1280
01:50:51,694 --> 01:50:54,720
Put it in the interview.
Don't leave anything out.

1281
01:50:55,264 --> 01:50:56,925
I said, get out!

1282
01:50:59,535 --> 01:51:00,866
I've had it with you.

1283
01:51:02,438 --> 01:51:06,238
You can trash your life,
but you're not gonna trash mine.

1284
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:24,216
Esther, for Christ's sake!

1285
01:51:26,829 --> 01:51:28,524
Esther, for God's sake.

1286
01:51:29,932 --> 01:51:32,298
God damn it, you're gonna hurt yourself.

1287
01:51:34,002 --> 01:51:35,196
You stupid bastard!

1288
01:51:35,637 --> 01:51:37,502
I won't let you humiliate me.

1289
01:51:37,773 --> 01:51:38,797
Fight!

1290
01:51:39,141 --> 01:51:40,665
Fight, you bastard!

1291
01:51:40,876 --> 01:51:42,400
Protect yourself.

1292
01:51:42,511 --> 01:51:44,138
I'll kill you.

1293
01:51:51,186 --> 01:51:52,710
I tried to tell you.

1294
01:51:53,655 --> 01:51:54,883
It's no good with me.

1295
01:51:56,191 --> 01:51:57,317
It was good.

1296
01:51:58,961 --> 01:52:00,155
You stupid...

1297
01:52:01,964 --> 01:52:03,295
Until you blew it.

1298
01:52:05,768 --> 01:52:06,757
With her?

1299
01:52:08,203 --> 01:52:09,795
You're crazy. She's nothing.

1300
01:52:11,240 --> 01:52:12,502
Don't insult me.

1301
01:52:13,275 --> 01:52:15,072
She has nothing to do with it.

1302
01:52:21,917 --> 01:52:24,511
- Esther.
- Would you shut up?

1303
01:52:27,089 --> 01:52:29,023
What are you trying to do,
make me hate you?

1304
01:52:29,091 --> 01:52:31,150
So long. I'll let you go.

1305
01:52:31,727 --> 01:52:33,854
Oh, God, how corny.

1306
01:52:36,832 --> 01:52:40,268
- Esther, listen...
- Shut up, don't try to say anything to me.

1307
01:52:41,437 --> 01:52:42,802
I have to think.

1308
01:52:50,546 --> 01:52:52,946
- Baby...
- Don't touch me.

1309
01:52:56,752 --> 01:52:58,310
Don't touch me.

1310
01:53:02,691 --> 01:53:04,124
I don't like you anymore.

1311
01:53:18,140 --> 01:53:20,973
Where the hell are you running to now,
you fucking coward?

1312
01:53:24,279 --> 01:53:26,213
I don't wanna do this to you anymore.

1313
01:53:26,281 --> 01:53:28,306
Then fight for me, God damn it...

1314
01:53:29,284 --> 01:53:30,876
because if you keep walking...

1315
01:53:32,688 --> 01:53:33,677
I'll hate you.

1316
01:53:37,392 --> 01:53:38,791
And I'll hate you forever.

1317
01:53:43,131 --> 01:53:44,462
I love you, Esther.

1318
01:53:47,603 --> 01:53:49,161
Well, I hate you.

1319
01:53:57,045 --> 01:53:58,342
I love you.

1320
01:54:01,183 --> 01:54:02,172
I hate you.

1321
01:54:11,927 --> 01:54:14,555
- I love you.
- I hate you.

1322
01:54:28,944 --> 01:54:29,933
I love you.

1323
01:55:17,559 --> 01:55:20,027
Johnny, I'm so happy
we're going out together.

1324
01:55:20,629 --> 01:55:21,618
Yeah.

1325
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:25,829
God, how great, no phones.

1326
01:55:28,403 --> 01:55:30,200
Did you call Brian about the tour?

1327
01:55:30,806 --> 01:55:31,795
No, not yet.

1328
01:55:31,907 --> 01:55:35,104
I figured I'll tell him when
I pick him up at the airport tomorrow.

1329
01:55:35,243 --> 01:55:36,801
I can't wait to see his face.

1330
01:55:37,212 --> 01:55:41,308
I hope it's not too late to change
all those ads and the promos.

1331
01:55:43,518 --> 01:55:45,179
You know what I want you to do?

1332
01:55:45,988 --> 01:55:48,821
I want you to tell me about the road again.
Tell me again.

1333
01:55:49,024 --> 01:55:50,252
How's it gonna be? Go ahead.

1334
01:55:52,894 --> 01:55:54,486
Everything's gonna be all right.

1335
01:55:56,298 --> 01:55:59,529
Remember that thing you told me
just the other night.

1336
01:56:00,202 --> 01:56:03,103
I don't wanna talk about it.
I'm tired. Tired of words.

1337
01:56:03,171 --> 01:56:06,231
About how you weren't gonna let me
trash your life.

1338
01:56:06,308 --> 01:56:08,936
I don't know what I said,
I don't even remember.

1339
01:56:09,444 --> 01:56:10,536
Yeah, well, I do.

1340
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:14,340
I liked the way you said it.
You were right.

1341
01:56:16,551 --> 01:56:18,917
Yeah, well,
maybe I can teach you something, too.

1342
01:56:20,589 --> 01:56:22,489
What I liked about it was that...

1343
01:56:23,191 --> 01:56:24,920
it sounded like you knew who you were.

1344
01:56:27,996 --> 01:56:29,861
I'm Esther Hoffman Howard.

1345
01:56:30,332 --> 01:56:31,356
That's right.

1346
01:56:31,933 --> 01:56:33,491
And don't you ever forget it.

1347
01:57:25,754 --> 01:57:26,948
Where are you going?

1348
01:57:27,489 --> 01:57:28,922
I gotta go pick up Brian.

1349
01:57:30,859 --> 01:57:31,848
Oh, I forgot.

1350
01:57:33,462 --> 01:57:34,986
Just wait a minute, okay?

1351
01:57:35,697 --> 01:57:37,790
I'll get dressed, okay?

1352
01:57:39,067 --> 01:57:40,125
It's so cold.

1353
01:57:41,236 --> 01:57:43,397
I wish you could come back to bed
with me.

1354
01:57:44,372 --> 01:57:47,000
You go back to sleep, darling.

1355
01:57:47,209 --> 01:57:48,198
I'll go get him.

1356
01:57:48,276 --> 01:57:50,801
He would have to take an early plane,
wouldn't he?

1357
01:57:51,012 --> 01:57:52,001
That's Brian.

1358
01:57:53,782 --> 01:57:56,410
- You hurry up home now, okay?
- Okay.

1359
01:58:01,723 --> 01:58:03,714
I'll have breakfast waiting for you.

1360
01:58:04,659 --> 01:58:06,126
Like a good little wife.

1361
01:58:15,871 --> 01:58:16,860
What?

1362
01:58:18,707 --> 01:58:19,867
Just looking, baby.

1363
01:58:23,178 --> 01:58:24,167
I love you.

1364
01:58:47,903 --> 01:58:48,892
Hey, boy. Good morning.

1365
01:58:50,806 --> 01:58:52,205
Yeah, that's a good dog.

1366
02:02:08,770 --> 02:02:10,465
<i>5821 to Adam.</i>

1367
02:02:10,638 --> 02:02:14,506
<i>All right, I'm about 14 miles due east...</i>

1368
02:02:14,576 --> 02:02:17,170
<i>of the interstate on County 327.</i>

1369
02:02:17,245 --> 02:02:21,545
<i>I've got a single-vehicle fatality,
no secondary vehicle involvement.</i>

1370
02:02:21,616 --> 02:02:26,417
<i>The subject vehicle left the roadway
approximately 160 mph.</i>

1371
02:02:28,556 --> 02:02:33,084
<i>Crossed the shoulder,
impact at 145 feet due east.</i>

1372
02:02:33,294 --> 02:02:36,161
<i>No roll bar, no subsequent fire damage.</i>

1373
02:02:36,231 --> 02:02:38,927
<i>The deceased will be transported
by rescue ambulance.</i>

1374
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,195
<i>- 10-4, bye, Victor.
- 10-4, Grace.</i>

1375
02:02:41,269 --> 02:02:43,203
- I got it.
- Go on. Get out of here.

1376
02:02:43,538 --> 02:02:44,766
You, too, mac.

1377
02:03:10,432 --> 02:03:14,528
He needs a blanket.
Could you... Bring him a blanket, okay?

1378
02:03:28,817 --> 02:03:32,150
Could you please not stare at him now?
Just...

1379
02:03:55,844 --> 02:03:57,243
I'm so scared, Johnny.

1380
02:04:02,117 --> 02:04:03,778
I don't know what to do.

1381
02:04:08,890 --> 02:04:10,050
Hold me!

1382
02:04:12,060 --> 02:04:13,391
Please, hold me!

1383
02:04:26,908 --> 02:04:28,239
Gotta move him.

1384
02:04:30,211 --> 02:04:31,235
What?

1385
02:04:31,312 --> 02:04:33,280
Gotta move him, honey, come on.

1386
02:04:34,015 --> 02:04:35,004
No.

1387
02:04:36,551 --> 02:04:37,984
- Yes, we gotta move him.
- No.

1388
02:04:38,786 --> 02:04:40,014
- Come on.
- No.

1389
02:04:52,834 --> 02:04:54,062
No, please, don't.

1390
02:04:57,138 --> 02:04:59,038
Be gentle with him, please.

1391
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:01,037
- He'll be all right.
- Don't hurt him.

1392
02:05:01,809 --> 02:05:03,174
- Don't hurt him.
- One...

1393
02:05:04,612 --> 02:05:05,601
two...

1394
02:05:07,448 --> 02:05:08,437
three.

1395
02:05:09,017 --> 02:05:10,780
Come on, let me give you a hand.

1396
02:05:16,724 --> 02:05:18,123
Watch your foot there.

1397
02:05:20,762 --> 02:05:23,162
- I got it.
- Come on, lady, please.

1398
02:05:23,264 --> 02:05:24,925
I told you to get out of here.

1399
02:05:26,067 --> 02:05:27,364
You, too, buddy. Enough is enough.

1400
02:05:27,435 --> 02:05:28,424
Just one more.

1401
02:05:31,906 --> 02:05:33,771
<i>He was like a brother to me.</i>

1402
02:05:35,009 --> 02:05:36,840
<i>I don't know what you boobies call him...</i>

1403
02:05:37,212 --> 02:05:39,680
<i>but Bebe Jesus calls him
one of the greats.</i>

1404
02:05:40,715 --> 02:05:42,239
<i>One of the all-time greats.</i>

1405
02:05:44,052 --> 02:05:45,815
<i>John Norman Howard.</i>

1406
02:06:20,221 --> 02:06:22,451
<i>Can somebody pick that up out there?</i>

1407
02:06:22,957 --> 02:06:24,322
Johnny.

1408
02:06:29,230 --> 02:06:30,857
<i>- Hello?
- Johnny.</i>

1409
02:06:32,400 --> 02:06:34,129
<i>No, this isn't her secretary.</i>

1410
02:06:42,343 --> 02:06:43,332
Hey, lady.

1411
02:06:44,412 --> 02:06:46,107
How do you turn this thing off?

1412
02:07:23,017 --> 02:07:24,006
You're a liar.

1413
02:07:29,324 --> 02:07:30,689
You're a liar.

1414
02:07:35,029 --> 02:07:36,428
And you're a big talker.

1415
02:07:37,799 --> 02:07:39,664
Talk.

1416
02:07:42,937 --> 02:07:44,962
What the hell is wrong with you, anyway?

1417
02:07:48,976 --> 02:07:50,466
You're selfish, that's what.

1418
02:07:54,315 --> 02:07:55,304
Shit!

1419
02:07:57,018 --> 02:07:58,315
Oh, God!

1420
02:08:02,724 --> 02:08:05,192
You are a very selfish person.

1421
02:08:08,596 --> 02:08:09,824
And a liar!

1422
02:08:10,631 --> 02:08:14,761
Because you promised me,
you son of a bitch, you promised me.

1423
02:08:15,370 --> 02:08:17,429
You promised me and you lied.

1424
02:08:18,373 --> 02:08:19,465
You lied.

1425
02:08:23,745 --> 02:08:27,806
You lied to me!

1426
02:08:47,568 --> 02:08:48,830
I'm sorry, Johnny.

1427
02:08:50,405 --> 02:08:53,863
It's just that there were so many things
I wanted to tell you.

1428
02:09:28,042 --> 02:09:29,373
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1429
02:09:30,711 --> 02:09:34,010
<i>Esther Hoffman Howard.</i>
