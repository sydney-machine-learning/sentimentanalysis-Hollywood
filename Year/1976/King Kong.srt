00:00:56,291 --> 00:01:03,957
SURABAYA
INDONESIA

2
00:01:35,291 --> 00:01:40,541
- How much you got here, Boan?
- About 1,800.

3
00:01:40,707 --> 00:01:43,707
- What's going on?
- There's Bagley.

4
00:01:43,874 --> 00:01:50,124
Mr. Bagley! Something haywire.
We haven't loaded enough pipe.

5
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:54,166
- Less than 2,000 feet.
- That'll be enough.

6
00:01:54,332 --> 00:02:00,457
On Huang a tan, it didn't come
until we were past 26,000 feet.

7
00:02:00,624 --> 00:02:04,624
This hole proves out within 2,000,
or it's a write-off.

8
00:02:25,499 --> 00:02:28,041
How are you this evening?

9
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:34,041
All right.

10
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:50,207
The barometer is still falling.
It's a lousy forecast all right.

11
00:02:50,374 --> 00:02:54,082
We should stay here
another 48 hours.

12
00:02:54,249 --> 00:02:58,666
Every hour we delay gives others
a chance of beating us to the island.

13
00:02:58,832 --> 00:03:01,999
- I thought only we knew...
- We'll sail right away.

14
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:05,416
You'll be sorry.

15
00:03:05,582 --> 00:03:09,457
All right, Mr. Carnahan,
ready to let go.

16
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:15,582
- Stand by fore and aft.
- OK, haul the gangway ashore!

17
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:53,582
Let it go.

18
00:04:01,499 --> 00:04:04,582
- Roy.
- Fred.

19
00:04:06,207 --> 00:04:10,666
Well, here's to the big one.

20
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:31,374
MAIN TITLE

21
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:41,624
Mayday, mayday.

22
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:46,457
Mayday.

23
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,707
I'm reminded of Amsterdam.

24
00:07:05,874 --> 00:07:11,874
Ever eat a raw herring with a beer
chaser and a scoop of ice cream?

25
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:31,666
- Captain here.
- I picked up a mayday call.

26
00:07:31,832 --> 00:07:36,082
- It faded before I could get a fix.
- Keep listening.

27
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:39,749
Let me know if you get anything.

28
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:49,624
Like you said:
"The hell with the weather.”

29
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:58,291
We can get out of this
by backtracking around Timor.

30
00:07:58,457 --> 00:08:03,082
- It'll only cost us a few days.
- Keep on course, I'm fine.

31
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:11,749
I gotta admit, for a New York
desk guy, you got a lot of guts.

32
00:08:11,916 --> 00:08:15,457
I sold this one to the board.

33
00:08:15,624 --> 00:08:21,041
If that island doesn't produce huge,
I'll be wiping windshields.

34
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:38,541
Men.
Carnahan.

35
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:48,749
I'd have told you earlier,
but I couldn't risk any talk.

36
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:57,082
Men, we may be sailing into
the history books. Hit the lights.

37
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:03,416
I believe we're headed for
the biggest oil strike ever.

38
00:09:03,582 --> 00:09:07,291
- Here in the magic circle.
- It's magic all right.

39
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:11,916
Are we supposed to find oil
under 2,000 fathoms of sea?

40
00:09:12,082 --> 00:09:18,374
Just sea is what the charts say.
Now let's take a look a low angle.

41
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:23,332
This was taken in 1943.

42
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:27,707
This wake was left by the ship
that took the photograph.

43
00:09:27,874 --> 00:09:33,957
No sign of land. Here's a fog bank
you wouldn't look at twice.

44
00:09:34,124 --> 00:09:37,416
Let's look at another picture.

45
00:09:37,582 --> 00:09:41,707
This is taken from precisely
the same angle.

46
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:46,082
Same area, same fog bank.

47
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:54,249
This was taken two weeks ago.
35 years later.

48
00:09:54,416 --> 00:09:59,874
A bank of fog that doesn't change
a wisp in 35 years. Fantastic.

49
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:04,249
Still nothing to explore,
except for one reason.

50
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:09,041
A spy satellite photographed it
by mistake.

51
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:15,541
I got hold of the classified pictures
via a donation to someone.

52
00:10:15,707 --> 00:10:19,916
No names, but he lives
on Pennsylvania Ave.

53
00:10:20,082 --> 00:10:22,749
OK, fellas.

54
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:27,457
Roy Bagley, would you take over
and let science make the point?

55
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:39,999
The satellite was to analyze
exhaust gases from a missile test.

56
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:44,624
So it was loaded with
two special kinds of film.

57
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:48,541
No, first the infrared.

58
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:55,082
The different colors represent
different surface temperatures.

59
00:10:55,249 --> 00:10:59,124
- You mean there's land there?
- Correct, Joe.

60
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:03,249
An island,
hidden by a perpetual fog bank.

61
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:08,457
Never seen by human eye
nor walked by human foot.

62
00:11:09,749 --> 00:11:14,499
The infrared patterns aren't like
any I've ever seen.

63
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:19,332
More surprising, though, is
what the spectrograph picked up.

64
00:11:19,499 --> 00:11:23,541
Chemical composition
of our mysterious fog bank.

65
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:29,666
Free hydrocarbon radicals,
excess nitrogen, carbon dioxide.

66
00:11:29,832 --> 00:11:33,957
And, not poisonous
but very damn curious...

67
00:11:34,124 --> 00:11:39,791
This has to be caused by vapors
seeping up through the ground.

68
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:44,207
- Vapors from petroleum deposits.
- Yes!

69
00:11:44,374 --> 00:11:50,582
That island is the tip of a huge
underground tank just waiting for us.

70
00:11:50,749 --> 00:11:55,166
- I'm betting everything I've got.
- I'll take 50 cents of that.

71
00:11:55,332 --> 00:12:00,624
The excess CO2 might also be
accounted for by animal respiration.

72
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:05,457
- Turn the lights on.
- Animal breathing.

73
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:07,582
Are you crazy?

74
00:12:07,749 --> 00:12:13,582
And I'm not so sure human feet
have never walked the island before.

75
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:19,832
In 1605, Fernando De Queres
was blown south from Tenotang.

76
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:25,666
He wrote of the piercing the
white veil. That's the cloud bank.

77
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:29,624
And landing on the beach of the skull,
where he heard the roar -

78
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:33,874
- of the greatest beast...

79
00:12:34,041 --> 00:12:39,874
The rest of that log entry
was suppressed by Rome.

80
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:45,166
In 1749, a water-logged lifeboat
was found in the same area.

81
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:51,291
It was empty,
but drawn in blood on the port -

82
00:12:51,457 --> 00:12:58,582
- was a likeness of a huge,
slouchy humanoid thing.

83
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:01,332
And this strange warning:

84
00:13:03,624 --> 00:13:08,124
"From thy wedding with the creature
who touches heaven, lady, -

85
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:12,832
- God preserve thee."

86
00:13:12,999 --> 00:13:19,124
I also heard of a note in a bottle
from a dying Japanese in 1944...

87
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:22,957
What the hell are you talking about?
Who is this joker?

88
00:13:23,124 --> 00:13:26,624
- Beats me.
- He's wearing a crew jersey.

89
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,582
I'll pay any fair amount
for my... passage.

90
00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:33,082
- You're a stowaway?
- Jack Prescott. From Princeton.

91
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:36,374
- Dept. Of Primate Paleonthology.
- You lying hippie!

92
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:41,291
You're from another oil company!
The meeting's over.

93
00:13:41,457 --> 00:13:45,457
He's got one of our T-shirts.

94
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:55,874
This doesn't mean a thing. Gulf
or Exxon can fix a fake passport.

95
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:59,749
- Who the hell are you?
- I am Jack Prescott...

96
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:07,124
My interest in your island
has got nothing to do with oil.

97
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:11,499
You're not even a good liar. You
couldn't find out where we're going.

98
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:17,916
- You bought charts!
- Come on. Who'd you pay off?

99
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:25,499
They hadn't sold charts for this area
in years. A friend tipped me.

100
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:30,457
I did pick up
some charts in Surabaya.

101
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:36,499
Take this spy below till he's hungry
enough to stop spouting ape shit.

102
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,916
Let's go. Come on.

103
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:55,291
- There's something out there.
- Oh, come on!

104
00:14:55,457 --> 00:14:59,499
- Honest to God, look!
- Quit horsing around.

105
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,749
Come back here!

106
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:08,957
There's something out there!
About 2 o'clock. Use your glasses.

107
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:13,082
Son of a bitch, it's a raft!

108
00:15:35,249 --> 00:15:37,916
All stop.

109
00:16:10,957 --> 00:16:13,624
She's alive!

110
00:16:28,624 --> 00:16:31,207
Gently.

111
00:16:34,207 --> 00:16:39,416
I've had first-aid training, Captain.
Will you all clear out of here?

112
00:16:39,582 --> 00:16:42,291
- You have to undress her, huh?
- It's usual.

113
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:46,791
In case of internal injury
or shock syndrome.

114
00:16:46,957 --> 00:16:50,124
- Get outta here!
- Clear out.

115
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:04,207
Eye Magnate. Beverly Hills.

116
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:09,082
There's no sign of
injuries anywhere.

117
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:15,999
C-Y-N-A-R-A. Sounds like a yacht.

118
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:21,832
- Careless yachtsman, to lose this.
- Remember that mayday call?

119
00:17:28,249 --> 00:17:32,582
You can stop sweating. Navy
record's clean, it all checks out.

120
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:35,999
Fingerprints.
The guy's kosher.

121
00:17:37,499 --> 00:17:41,582
I know just how to use him, too.

122
00:17:44,499 --> 00:17:50,916
The girl's about to come to. She
could be hysterical, so follow me.

123
00:17:54,541 --> 00:18:00,916
- Can I get a cheeseburger here?
- You went to medical school, right?

124
00:18:01,082 --> 00:18:05,082
What have you got, crystal balls?

125
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:07,957
There's nothing I haven't checked.

126
00:18:08,124 --> 00:18:12,291
I know the day and hour
you completed your toilet training.

127
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:16,916
Now we gotta figure a way for you
to work off your room and board.

128
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:23,582
- You're pretty good with a camera.
- I've snapped a few monkeys.

129
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:28,832
Congratulations.
You're now our official photographer.

130
00:18:56,207 --> 00:18:59,541
Hello. Everything's fine.

131
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:04,249
You're safe and well
on an American merchant vessel.

132
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:11,082
Where's Harry and everyone?

133
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:23,332
- You mean they're gone?
- Do you remember anything?

134
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,791
No. No.

135
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,541
Yeah...

136
00:19:41,874 --> 00:19:45,124
I was on deck and then...

137
00:19:47,082 --> 00:19:50,957
- Then I was swimming to a star.
- To a light.

138
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:54,666
Let her call it a star.

139
00:19:54,832 --> 00:20:00,499
The life-raft was blown over board
near you. It had an automatic flare.

140
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,374
I'm Fred Wilson, I'm in charge.

141
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:08,707
The yacht didn't get very far
after the SOS.

142
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:14,916
The radio reported that someone
found a piece of charred hull.

143
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,582
We're sorry, ma'am.

144
00:20:21,374 --> 00:20:24,541
So am I.

145
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:30,041
Harry had discovered me.

146
00:20:31,457 --> 00:20:37,457
He was going to put me in a movie
he was making in Hong Kong.

147
00:20:37,624 --> 00:20:40,707
Dumb luck.

148
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:46,291
But I guess I really can't complain.

149
00:20:47,707 --> 00:20:53,707
When you're alone adrift
in the Pacific and somebody just...

150
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:58,999
- Who spotted me, by the way?
- That young fellow.

151
00:21:03,124 --> 00:21:06,124
How can I ever thank you?

152
00:21:09,666 --> 00:21:13,082
I'm Dwan.

153
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:21,624
D-W-A-N. That's my name.
Like Dawn, -

154
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:27,707
- except that I switched two letters
to make it more memorable.

155
00:21:27,874 --> 00:21:33,082
- I'm a mere Jack.
- You must be kidding.

156
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:39,291
How could anybody
who saved my life be mere to me?

157
00:21:39,457 --> 00:21:42,957
You need some rest.

158
00:21:43,124 --> 00:21:48,207
I haven't had a good one of those
in years.

159
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:54,957
- Are we headed back to Singapore?
- Not directly, ma'am.

160
00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:06,541
I guess it doesn't matter.
I'm in no rush.

161
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:15,041
Harry probably wouldn't have
put me in that movie anyhow.

162
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:24,124
Oh, my God!

163
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:31,166
What a meaningful miracle!

164
00:22:31,332 --> 00:22:35,582
- I owe my life to a movie.
- Is that so?

165
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:39,124
I swear to God.

166
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:43,374
Harry was showing
this film that I refused to watch.

167
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:48,582
That's why I was up on deck
when the yacht exploded.

168
00:22:48,749 --> 00:22:54,707
Did you ever meet anyone whose
life was saved by "Deep Throat"?

169
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:58,541
Come on, men, let her rest.

170
00:23:04,791 --> 00:23:08,124
Maybe my luck has changed.

171
00:25:05,124 --> 00:25:07,416
You know something?

172
00:25:07,582 --> 00:25:12,249
I always wondered how Cortes felt
when he first saw the Inca treasure.

173
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:16,332
It was Pizarro,
and he died busted.

174
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:40,916
Here we go...
Solid land all right.

175
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:47,082
This is its profile east to west.
Typical Pacific formation...

176
00:25:47,249 --> 00:25:51,874
This would be the slope at the beach,
the mountainous sector at the west.

177
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:54,332
Let's get in closer.

178
00:25:56,916 --> 00:26:00,166
- What was that?
- Just a glitch.

179
00:26:00,332 --> 00:26:04,541
- False echo off a flock of birds.
- Spot anything unusual?

180
00:26:04,707 --> 00:26:08,541
- Not a thing.
- Look at the screen, Fred.

181
00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:20,541
All those going ashore,
report to the companionway.

182
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:29,207
Hi there.
How do you like this for beach wear?

183
00:26:29,374 --> 00:26:33,582
Fantastic. I'm afraid
you can't come ashore, though.

184
00:26:33,749 --> 00:26:37,041
Wait a minute.

185
00:26:37,207 --> 00:26:41,749
You said I could come
on the first boat.

186
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:45,624
You should wait
till the recon is gone.

187
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:49,582
You want full coverage
of this landing, don't you?

188
00:26:49,749 --> 00:26:53,916
I must be in it. The all-American
girl saved from a yacht -

189
00:26:54,082 --> 00:26:57,582
- by "Deep Throat".

190
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:03,916
- Don't print those, I'm married.
- Guaranteed to be on People Magazine.

191
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:08,207
- Print just one.
- Really, Mr. Wilson...

192
00:27:08,374 --> 00:27:12,457
I need a break,
and you owe it to me.

193
00:27:12,624 --> 00:27:17,916
Because I am a holder of
a Petrox credit card. I really am!

194
00:27:18,082 --> 00:27:20,874
Ask your computer.

195
00:27:21,041 --> 00:27:27,332
I may be late on my payments, but
you take 18% interest plus charges.

196
00:27:27,499 --> 00:27:34,249
Dwan, you come ashore with us.
Captain, she'll come ashore.

197
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:39,624
Good luck. As soon as you get
through, get on the horn.

198
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:49,541
Hey, Jack? Maybe it's him.
Fred Wilson.

199
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:55,707
I had my horoscope done
before I flew to Hong Kong.

200
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:59,041
- It said that I was...
- Here you go.

201
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:03,499
It said that I was going to cross
over water -

202
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:07,291
- and meet the biggest person
in my life.

203
00:28:54,416 --> 00:29:00,666
That's interesting. The current is
18 degrees cooler than the air.

204
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:06,166
- What does that mean?
- The fog might lift at the edge.

205
00:29:06,332 --> 00:29:10,541
Crossing 20 fathoms.
Shallowing rapidly.

206
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:19,541
Standing up ahead.
I think I hear breakers.

207
00:29:36,832 --> 00:29:41,082
Shore boat to Explorer.
There's a curtain around the island.

208
00:29:41,249 --> 00:29:44,291
We just broke through.
There's a beach dead ahead.

209
00:29:44,457 --> 00:29:47,874
In two words: No problem.

210
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:54,707
Let me get down! I haven't
touched the ground in weeks.

211
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:05,749
That's good.

212
00:31:05,916 --> 00:31:10,332
Jack! I'm coming ashore.

213
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:15,457
Wait, hold it. All right.

214
00:31:19,124 --> 00:31:21,916
Beautiful.

215
00:31:27,374 --> 00:31:32,749
Let's start getting a line on this
island. Bring the mosquito spray!

216
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:39,207
We won't have to start wondering
which way to go.

217
00:31:39,374 --> 00:31:43,332
You want to start setting
seismic charges this morning?

218
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:49,082
- Yes. Got to knock the structure.
- All right, move out!

219
00:32:01,749 --> 00:32:05,166
There's a waterfall ahead!

220
00:32:05,332 --> 00:32:08,749
Last one to get in
is a rotten egg.

221
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:56,041
Don't go running off anymore.

222
00:32:57,582 --> 00:33:00,582
We'll wait here for them.

223
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:07,666
Just stick close by me, OK?

224
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:35,832
Holy Mother!
That looks as old as the pyramids.

225
00:34:35,999 --> 00:34:42,332
Could be. But the pyramids
weren't repaired six months ago.

226
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:48,749
There's earth on those timbers. It has
to be replaced after each monsoon.

227
00:34:48,916 --> 00:34:53,166
Are you telling me
there's people here?

228
00:34:53,332 --> 00:34:57,832
What's more, I'll characterize them.
Scared people.

229
00:34:57,999 --> 00:35:02,832
- Scared of what?
- I don't exactly what it is.

230
00:35:02,999 --> 00:35:09,291
But apparently, they thought
they needed a wall to keep it out.

231
00:35:09,457 --> 00:35:12,999
Let me straighten you out
on a couple of points.

232
00:35:13,166 --> 00:35:18,832
One: This wall is an ancient ruin.

233
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:23,541
Two: The island is uninhabited.

234
00:35:31,999 --> 00:35:36,957
And three: There's an uninhabited
German beer hall in there.

235
00:35:37,124 --> 00:35:39,707
Let's go.

236
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:55,666
Fred? Look down there.
Take your binoculars.

237
00:36:57,291 --> 00:37:01,499
- What?
- Down there, that pool.

238
00:37:12,207 --> 00:37:17,082
- Do you think it could be?
- The surface seems viscous.

239
00:37:17,249 --> 00:37:20,166
It sure as hell could be oil.

240
00:37:21,749 --> 00:37:26,041
Sweet Jesus! Rockefeller!

241
00:37:46,457 --> 00:37:51,457
- Maybe it's a wedding.
- A good guess.

242
00:37:51,624 --> 00:37:56,249
It's scheduled for the night
when the moon's full.

243
00:38:00,124 --> 00:38:03,291
Where's the groom?

244
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:16,082
See the one
in the ape mask?

245
00:38:16,249 --> 00:38:21,207
You might say
that's the groom's stand-in.

246
00:38:21,374 --> 00:38:25,041
The groom is
on the other side of the wall.

247
00:38:25,207 --> 00:38:29,374
You mean it's bad luck if they
see each other before the wedding?

248
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:32,124
Ghastly luck
for the whole congregation.

249
00:39:01,416 --> 00:39:03,874
Oh, Christ!

250
00:39:10,374 --> 00:39:13,374
You want to talk for us?

251
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:18,332
I'll try.

252
00:39:18,499 --> 00:39:21,749
Shoot in the air only.

253
00:39:30,082 --> 00:39:33,082
What's he bitching about?

254
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:38,999
He's probably telling us we've
contaminated their magic.

255
00:40:01,624 --> 00:40:04,291
No.

256
00:40:10,332 --> 00:40:13,957
Remember, in the air.

257
00:40:36,499 --> 00:40:38,957
What is it?

258
00:40:40,666 --> 00:40:44,916
He wants to make a deal.
Six of them for Dwan.

259
00:40:45,082 --> 00:40:48,832
Tell them that I like him, too,
but not that way.

260
00:40:51,874 --> 00:40:54,749
In the air!

261
00:42:21,624 --> 00:42:25,707
- You'll have trouble with the chief.
- I will buy the chief.

262
00:42:25,874 --> 00:42:29,582
What have we got
that wogs go for?

263
00:42:29,749 --> 00:42:34,541
Radios, pots and pans,
all sorts of junk.

264
00:42:34,707 --> 00:42:39,916
This is no longer the 19th century.
You can't just grab their island.

265
00:42:40,082 --> 00:42:43,041
I'll check that with the UN.
In the meantime -

266
00:42:43,207 --> 00:42:46,374
- we scare them into the boondocks
with a July 4th number.

267
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:49,416
Are your men ready
to set the charges?

268
00:42:49,582 --> 00:42:51,916
Kong! Kong!

269
00:42:52,082 --> 00:42:56,749
You heard him chant.
He exists. You saw the wall.

270
00:42:56,916 --> 00:42:59,957
Who do you think they were planning
to give the girl to?

271
00:43:00,124 --> 00:43:06,166
It's some nutty religion.
A priest dresses up and gets laid.

272
00:43:06,332 --> 00:43:09,874
We'll humor Jack.
Take plenty of TNT.

273
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:13,832
Any sign of a monkey bigger
than four feet, send it bang-bang.

274
00:43:13,999 --> 00:43:16,749
- You wouldn't.
- Bet me.

275
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:26,999
Even you wouldn't be asshole enough
to wipe out a unique new species.

276
00:43:29,582 --> 00:43:34,124
The kids would burn every
Petrox gas station in the country.

277
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:50,832
- He could be right.
- Kong, Kong, Kong...

278
00:43:53,332 --> 00:43:57,957
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to steal a boat.

279
00:43:58,124 --> 00:44:03,332
- Seriously?
- As soon as I've swiped supplies.

280
00:44:03,499 --> 00:44:08,582
- I'm going on a camera hunt.
- That sounds dangerous.

281
00:44:08,749 --> 00:44:14,082
It's a chance of a lifetime. You
either grab it or you're dead meat.

282
00:44:14,249 --> 00:44:21,332
You shouldn't go ashore tonight.
It's not a good night for Aries.

283
00:44:21,499 --> 00:44:24,874
How did you know I was an Aries?

284
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:30,541
By the shape of your ears.

285
00:44:30,707 --> 00:44:36,499
All right, I asked Fred Wilson.
He knows everything about you.

286
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:42,749
- I really wish you wouldn't go.
- Is it better to watch an old movie?

287
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:45,416
There's nothing else to do.

288
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:48,666
Use your imagination.

289
00:44:50,624 --> 00:44:55,249
80 times around the deck
is a mile. We could jog.

290
00:45:04,457 --> 00:45:09,749
I guess my camera hunt can wait
a couple of hours.

291
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:16,457
Excuse me, I'll just finish stealing
in the galley.

292
00:45:16,624 --> 00:45:20,582
You'll disappoint me if you're here
when I get back.

293
00:45:20,749 --> 00:45:26,666
- What do you mean?
- I hope you'll wait in your cabin.

294
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:05,166
Here you are, son.
Get it out right away.

295
00:46:05,332 --> 00:46:08,166
All right.

296
00:46:10,541 --> 00:46:15,374
I said that pool might be oil.
We can't be sure...

297
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:21,457
Think positive. Guys who think
negative don't get far at Petrox.

298
00:46:21,624 --> 00:46:26,249
"Has to be the biggest ever.
No problems at all."

299
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:32,707
- Well, you're the boss.
- Don't worry about it, Roy.

300
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:55,957
Help!

301
00:54:59,707 --> 00:55:02,832
Help me!

302
00:55:13,332 --> 00:55:16,332
No!

303
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:06,749
We're too late.
Set off the show.

304
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:53,374
- Help him with that bolt.
- Cover the gate.

305
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:59,041
Get on the other side!
Pull!

306
00:57:03,624 --> 00:57:06,874
Open that gate!

307
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:15,582
The lights will hold him back!
Don't shoot.

308
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:46,582
- He's taken her.
- No one's taken her.

309
00:57:46,749 --> 00:57:51,291
Who do you think went through
there, some guy in an ape suit?

310
00:57:56,957 --> 00:58:01,124
- You all right?
- I just fell in a Goddamn hole.

311
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:05,707
No, you didn't.
You're not in a hole.

312
00:58:05,874 --> 00:58:08,874
That's a footprint.

313
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:30,916
Carnahan here. We've gone over two
miles. There's still no sign of her.

314
00:58:31,082 --> 00:58:36,332
- It's better than finding remains.
- Unless he's gobbled her down.

315
00:58:36,499 --> 00:58:41,832
Give me that thing.
Most jungle apes eat only fruit.

316
00:58:41,999 --> 00:58:46,249
Most jungle apes don't have
a size-90 foot.

317
00:58:46,416 --> 00:58:49,999
The men have had it.
I'm going to pitch camp.

318
00:58:50,166 --> 00:58:53,249
Are you a bunch of old ladies?
Come on.

319
00:58:53,416 --> 00:58:55,999
Keep moving.

320
00:58:59,707 --> 00:59:02,791
Carnahan's right.
It makes more sense to stop.

321
00:59:02,957 --> 00:59:06,666
All right, Carnahan.
You know the drill.

322
00:59:06,832 --> 00:59:11,332
We'll plant seismic charges
for mapping and fire rockets...

323
00:59:11,499 --> 00:59:16,541
- Right, right!
- Will somebody be on the radar?

324
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:25,957
Any large, furry blimp seen moving
in your direction, you'll know.

325
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:33,499
That footprint measured 6.4 feet.

326
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:37,749
If that were for real.
How high would that make him?

327
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:42,291
Multiplied by about eight, I guess.

328
00:59:44,499 --> 00:59:47,374
He'd make a hell of a commercial.

329
00:59:47,541 --> 00:59:52,416
"The battles we at Petrox fight
to fill your tank."

330
01:00:06,374 --> 01:00:10,457
If he's not going to eat her,
why did he take her?

331
01:00:13,707 --> 01:00:18,666
Apes are very territorial.
He'll probably take her to his turf.

332
01:00:18,832 --> 01:00:21,249
What for?

333
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:25,957
Joe said you said that the ape
was going to marry her.

334
01:00:26,124 --> 01:00:31,624
- Is that some kind of joke or...
- I don't know, Carnahan!

335
01:00:31,791 --> 01:00:37,332
I'm as ignorant as you. Quit asking
me so many dumb questions.

336
01:03:37,582 --> 01:03:40,749
I can't stand heights.

337
01:03:43,832 --> 01:03:50,999
Honest I can't. When I was ten I got
sick in the Empire State Building.

338
01:03:57,207 --> 01:04:00,624
Put me down!

339
01:04:04,957 --> 01:04:07,666
You put me down!

340
01:04:13,374 --> 01:04:17,499
You put me down!

341
01:04:19,916 --> 01:04:23,707
Put me down.

342
01:04:28,916 --> 01:04:32,499
Please put me down.

343
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:50,749
You Goddamn chauvinist pig ape!

344
01:04:50,916 --> 01:04:55,749
What are you waiting for?
You wanna eat me?

345
01:04:55,916 --> 01:05:02,624
Then go ahead! Do it!
Go ahead and eat me!

346
01:05:02,791 --> 01:05:07,166
Go ahead! Choke on me!

347
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:18,416
I didn't mean that.
Sometimes I get too physical.

348
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:23,707
It's a sign of insecurity,
like when you knock down trees.

349
01:05:26,541 --> 01:05:33,457
Such a nice ape.
Such a nice, sweet monkey.

350
01:05:34,916 --> 01:05:38,916
We're going to be great friends.

351
01:05:39,082 --> 01:05:45,791
I'm a Libra, what sign are you?
No, don't tell me.

352
01:05:45,957 --> 01:05:50,957
I'll bet you're an Aries.
Of course you are.

353
01:05:51,124 --> 01:05:54,457
I think that's just wonderful.

354
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:54,916
Help me!

355
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:02,499
Help me!

356
01:07:51,749 --> 01:07:55,332
Radar had him on the screen.

357
01:07:55,499 --> 01:08:02,499
3.6 kilometers west of your flare.
He moved in a random manner.

358
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:07,249
- Not in our direction?
- Affirmative. Random. Like a circle.

359
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:12,124
Maybe he's lost her. She got away
and he's searching for her.

360
01:08:12,291 --> 01:08:15,457
Carnahan! Wait a minute!

361
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:20,041
- Have you set seismic charges?
- The men are doing it now.

362
01:08:20,207 --> 01:08:24,666
- Don't move until it's finished.
- He's nuts.

363
01:08:24,832 --> 01:08:30,832
The girl might be running for her life
from a gigantic turned-on ape.

364
01:08:30,999 --> 01:08:34,791
I know how you feel.

365
01:08:34,957 --> 01:08:37,707
But there's an energy crisis.

366
01:08:37,874 --> 01:08:42,541
We must all rise above
our self-interests.

367
01:08:42,707 --> 01:08:48,249
- You hypocritical bastard...
- Save your wind, he's signed off.

368
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:50,916
Let's get going.

369
01:08:51,082 --> 01:08:54,416
I ain't busting my ass for no whites.

370
01:08:54,582 --> 01:09:00,499
OK. Who gives a shit that
the ape's headed in our direction?

371
01:11:16,082 --> 01:11:21,082
- There's Roy.
- Well, Fred...

372
01:11:21,249 --> 01:11:24,832
I finished testing the samples
from that pool.

373
01:11:24,999 --> 01:11:29,374
- It'll be real great oil!
- Son of a bitch!

374
01:11:30,874 --> 01:11:33,541
Fred Wilson is crazy, is he?

375
01:11:33,707 --> 01:11:38,666
Wait till those candy-asses
in New York hear about this.

376
01:11:38,832 --> 01:11:43,082
- I'll grind them...
- Like I said, it will be great oil.

377
01:11:43,249 --> 01:11:48,957
As soon as Mother Nature
finishes cooking it a little longer.

378
01:11:49,124 --> 01:11:51,624
How much longer?

379
01:11:51,791 --> 01:11:57,791
Hardly a tick of clock, in geological
terms. Say 10,000 years.

380
01:11:59,041 --> 01:12:05,207
Till then you'd get better mileage
filling your Cadillac with mule piss.

381
01:12:07,457 --> 01:12:10,124
Oh, my God!

382
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:15,624
I hate to kick a fella when he's dead,
but I told you.

383
01:12:15,791 --> 01:12:20,916
You shouldn't have told New York
you were bringing in the big one.

384
01:12:24,249 --> 01:12:28,541
The big one. Jesus!

385
01:12:30,832 --> 01:12:35,624
Who says I ain't gonna?
Wilson to Explorer.

386
01:12:35,791 --> 01:12:39,624
Get me a channel to Surabaya,
I want an engineer drop.

387
01:12:56,624 --> 01:12:59,457
OK, Jack, you go first.

388
01:13:32,124 --> 01:13:37,707
- Come on, it's solid as a rock.
- OK, let's go.

389
01:13:53,666 --> 01:13:57,249
- Stop firing!
- Jack!

390
01:16:20,624 --> 01:16:24,041
Boan! Try to make it back.

391
01:16:26,874 --> 01:16:30,124
I'm going on.

392
01:16:59,957 --> 01:17:03,541
All hands, stand by for recovery.

393
01:17:22,707 --> 01:17:26,207
- Over and out.
- Recharge the batteries.

394
01:17:26,374 --> 01:17:30,749
- Air drop done, right on target.
- Perfect. Haul your asses.

395
01:17:30,916 --> 01:17:34,999
Get that equipment working.

396
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:38,041
- You think I'm crazy?
- You said it.

397
01:17:38,207 --> 01:17:43,374
If I had found oil, Gulf, Shell, Exxon
would be crawling all over here.

398
01:17:43,541 --> 01:17:47,749
Not this one, pal.
Kong is all me and Petrox.

399
01:17:47,916 --> 01:17:53,541
A Fred S. Wilson exclusive.
Move your ass, Shorty.

400
01:17:57,666 --> 01:18:01,416
You think it'll ring the bell?
Promise oil, bring back a monkey?

401
01:18:01,582 --> 01:18:06,957
<i>Look at Exxon's
"We'll Put a Tiger in Your Tank".</i>

402
01:18:07,124 --> 01:18:12,499
Beach green to Carnahan.
Report back immediately.

403
01:18:12,666 --> 01:18:16,166
Do nothing to endanger Kong.
Acknowledge.

404
01:18:17,541 --> 01:18:22,749
Carnahan, do you read me?
Do you read me?

405
01:18:55,499 --> 01:18:59,166
Give us a hand over here.

406
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:09,041
Wilson!
Still no contact with Carnahan.

407
01:19:09,207 --> 01:19:13,416
- The radio's not working. No sweat.
- I want to take out a search party.

408
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:18,791
- I can't spare any men.
- Six guys are cut off in the bush.

409
01:19:18,957 --> 01:19:24,582
And you're building monkey traps.
You're playing with their lives.

410
01:19:24,749 --> 01:19:27,666
Don't worry about it.

411
01:19:33,582 --> 01:19:37,082
Boan!

412
01:19:40,499 --> 01:19:43,582
Where's the others?

413
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:27,291
Come on, Kong, forget about me.

414
01:20:27,457 --> 01:20:33,124
This is never going to work.
Can't you see?

415
01:23:00,374 --> 01:23:03,041
Jack!

416
01:24:26,124 --> 01:24:29,082
We've got to do it.

417
01:24:29,249 --> 01:24:32,582
Are you ready?

418
01:24:59,416 --> 01:25:04,749
Radar update. Monkey spotted
1,800 yards west by north-west -

419
01:25:04,916 --> 01:25:10,291
- heading 0-89,
velocity 2.2 miles per hour.

420
01:25:10,457 --> 01:25:15,207
Estimated time to your position,
five minutes or less.

421
01:25:15,374 --> 01:25:19,374
Kill the lights.
Everybody clear out!

422
01:25:27,166 --> 01:25:33,541
- Logan, how are you doing?
- Almost finished. One minute more.

423
01:25:37,916 --> 01:25:42,374
- That's enough.
- All set, Mr. Bagley!

424
01:25:45,041 --> 01:25:49,582
- Ready, Boan?
- OK. It's hot now.

425
01:25:49,749 --> 01:25:54,874
Are you sure that monkey will
be able to bust through that gate?

426
01:25:56,624 --> 01:25:59,999
Pull back the bolt halfway.

427
01:26:06,957 --> 01:26:10,416
- Come on.
- I can't.

428
01:26:50,041 --> 01:26:53,374
Open the gate! Help!

429
01:26:55,624 --> 01:26:59,124
- Help!
- Jack!

430
01:27:00,957 --> 01:27:03,874
It's Prescott, open the gate.

431
01:27:20,707 --> 01:27:23,457
Come on!

432
01:27:37,666 --> 01:27:40,207
Close the bolt!

433
01:29:17,332 --> 01:29:21,416
Wilson, blow the Goddamn thing!

434
01:32:15,624 --> 01:32:19,124
Still want to play?

435
01:32:21,124 --> 01:32:25,249
Dwan! Congratulations.

436
01:32:37,416 --> 01:32:40,749
Hey, Jack.
Do I look different?

437
01:32:42,707 --> 01:32:47,541
- Yeah, you shine.
- That's right.

438
01:32:47,707 --> 01:32:50,666
- I'm a star.
- It's all set.

439
01:32:50,832 --> 01:32:56,832
Coast-to-coast tour. We open in
New York. Lights, cameras, Kong!

440
01:32:56,999 --> 01:33:00,249
And probably Nureyev and Fontaine.

441
01:33:00,416 --> 01:33:05,832
I want Balanchine to choreograph
"The Beauty and the Beast".

442
01:33:07,749 --> 01:33:10,666
Any chance of you two
getting married?

443
01:33:10,832 --> 01:33:15,791
I don't know.
This is so sudden.

444
01:33:15,957 --> 01:33:21,332
We could think of some nutty way
of Kong giving away the bride.

445
01:33:24,582 --> 01:33:31,707
It'd be tough to get him to do it.
Probably just old-fashioned, huh?

446
01:33:31,874 --> 01:33:36,582
I don't know.
What do you think, Jack?

447
01:33:45,832 --> 01:33:48,207
Christ.

448
01:33:51,541 --> 01:33:58,374
After all these years,
I'll finally end up with a shrink.

449
01:34:05,666 --> 01:34:09,541
How can I become a star
because of someone -

450
01:34:09,707 --> 01:34:15,124
- that was stolen off that gorgeous
island and locked up in that tank?

451
01:34:15,291 --> 01:34:21,749
It's not someone. It's an animal
that tried to rape you.

452
01:34:21,916 --> 01:34:26,541
That's not true.
He risked his life to save me.

453
01:34:26,707 --> 01:34:29,499
He tried to rape you, honey.

454
01:34:29,666 --> 01:34:33,999
Ask the natives what they thought
of losing Kong.

455
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:38,499
- They'll miss him a lot.
- Like leprosy.

456
01:34:38,666 --> 01:34:45,249
You're dead wrong. He was the
terror, the mystery of their lives.

457
01:34:46,541 --> 01:34:51,499
A year from now, the island
will be full of burned-out drunks.

458
01:34:51,666 --> 01:34:55,874
When we took Kong,
we kidnapped their god.

459
01:34:59,874 --> 01:35:02,999
It's like there's a curse
on all of us.

460
01:35:03,166 --> 01:35:06,291
I'm tired of your trying to confuse
this girl.

461
01:35:06,457 --> 01:35:10,207
This is her big chance. And yours.
There's stars at Princeton -

462
01:35:10,374 --> 01:35:15,374
- just like in Hollywood. You want
me to get Kong another keeper?

463
01:35:15,541 --> 01:35:18,832
Coast-to-coast tours?
"Beauty and the Beast"? It's a farce.

464
01:35:18,999 --> 01:35:23,332
Just say the word and your contract
is torn up. Tell me right now.

465
01:35:28,374 --> 01:35:31,291
See you opening night.

466
01:35:44,082 --> 01:35:48,291
Oh, God,
I'm tired of thinking.

467
01:36:00,666 --> 01:36:05,707
- The ape had the right idea.
- What's that?

468
01:37:16,166 --> 01:37:19,249
Wait a minute.

469
01:37:22,666 --> 01:37:25,791
I'll be right back.

470
01:38:12,582 --> 01:38:15,999
All hands on deck!

471
01:38:20,624 --> 01:38:24,541
Fire detail,
report to the control room.

472
01:38:28,332 --> 01:38:32,332
This is the captain.
Sea water pumps to full pressure.

473
01:38:32,499 --> 01:38:37,124
Prepare to flood tank No. 4.
I'm ordering the ape drowned.

474
01:38:40,624 --> 01:38:44,916
Hey, Kong! Here I am.

475
01:38:50,499 --> 01:38:55,291
Do you remember me?
Remember your blind date?

476
01:38:55,457 --> 01:38:58,624
You haven't forgotten, have you?

477
01:39:07,124 --> 01:39:12,416
Dwan! Come back here!
He's going berserk.

478
01:39:12,582 --> 01:39:16,791
- Stop, or I'll jump.
- Dwan, please.

479
01:39:16,957 --> 01:39:21,582
- You can't help him now.
- Don't come any closer.

480
01:39:21,749 --> 01:39:24,291
OK.

481
01:39:26,916 --> 01:39:32,916
Hey, Kong? Why are you waking up
all these people?

482
01:39:33,082 --> 01:39:38,416
No one's going to hurt you.
You're just going to be a star.

483
01:39:47,582 --> 01:39:51,749
Don't flood the tank! She fell in.

484
01:41:59,791 --> 01:42:02,541
You could've...

485
01:43:03,832 --> 01:43:07,749
Jack! I'm so glad to see you.

486
01:43:10,749 --> 01:43:16,416
- What is it? You're not dressed.
- That's right.

487
01:43:16,582 --> 01:43:21,124
I was wrong when I called this
thing a farce, it's a tragedy.

488
01:43:21,291 --> 01:43:26,666
- I'm quitting your circus, Fred.
- You signed a contract.

489
01:43:26,832 --> 01:43:29,791
- You took an advance.
- I donated it in your name.

490
01:43:29,957 --> 01:43:35,457
To the SPCA Fund for Sending
Kong Home. Here's your receipt.

491
01:43:35,624 --> 01:43:40,582
- Sue me.
- Don't leave me tonight, please.

492
01:43:40,749 --> 01:43:44,874
- My horoscope says...
- Shut up. I love you.

493
01:43:48,791 --> 01:43:54,207
Come with me right now.
The hell with the contract.

494
01:43:54,374 --> 01:43:59,249
Go ahead. But I promise you
you'll never get another booking.

495
01:43:59,416 --> 01:44:03,332
You'll end up tap-dancing
at rotary clubs.

496
01:44:05,832 --> 01:44:11,082
- Don't you understand?
- Yeah...

497
01:44:11,249 --> 01:44:15,874
I do. Sorry.

498
01:44:18,541 --> 01:44:21,791
Stay well.

499
01:44:44,666 --> 01:44:48,499
Ladies and gentlemen
of our TV-satellite audience, -

500
01:44:48,666 --> 01:44:52,541
- you are seeing this
live around the world-

501
01:44:52,707 --> 01:44:58,416
- as it is happening
here in New York City.

502
01:44:58,582 --> 01:45:05,374
You have better seats than these
lucky King Kong contest winners.

503
01:45:26,499 --> 01:45:32,291
Thus, Beauty set foot on the
forbidden island and was seized.

504
01:45:32,457 --> 01:45:35,957
Great was the fear
as Beauty was lashed -

505
01:45:36,124 --> 01:45:41,249
- to the dreadful bridal altar
of the Beast.

506
01:45:41,416 --> 01:45:45,207
Now the earth booms.

507
01:46:19,416 --> 01:46:24,582
Kong's power!
Superpower!

508
01:46:26,791 --> 01:46:29,791
Hail the power!

509
01:47:03,207 --> 01:47:08,457
That's the power of Kong,
and Petrox!

510
01:47:20,707 --> 01:47:23,332
No! Don't push her around!

511
01:47:31,707 --> 01:47:35,707
Ladies and gentlemen,
there is nothing to fear!

512
01:47:35,874 --> 01:47:42,291
That is an escape-proof cage
certified by the city government.

513
01:48:06,082 --> 01:48:10,207
Come on out! Easy.

514
01:48:10,374 --> 01:48:14,041
His feet are still chained.

515
01:48:15,499 --> 01:48:19,582
It's all right. Come on.

516
01:50:18,041 --> 01:50:20,582
We're in position.

517
01:50:20,749 --> 01:50:25,624
The Queensboro Bridge is buttoned
up. What's the situation at Brooklyn?

518
01:50:25,791 --> 01:50:29,957
I'll tell that monkey to spread
before he crosses it.

519
01:50:32,624 --> 01:50:35,874
Come on, there's a train coming.

520
01:52:37,416 --> 01:52:39,916
Hit the lights.

521
01:52:55,541 --> 01:52:59,749
This is a message to all traffic.

522
01:52:59,916 --> 01:53:04,082
Clear all streets.
Proceed to shelters.

523
01:53:04,249 --> 01:53:11,541
Repeating: Clear all streets. Any
person found looting will be shot.

524
01:53:29,624 --> 01:53:32,541
Keep running.

525
01:53:32,707 --> 01:53:37,582
Jack! Buy me a drink, will you?

526
01:53:37,749 --> 01:53:40,707
Come on, buy me a drink.

527
01:53:40,874 --> 01:53:45,041
Ten more blocks and we've got
the key to a great apartment.

528
01:53:45,207 --> 01:53:48,166
We've put a river between us.

529
01:53:48,332 --> 01:53:52,791
The bridges are mined, and apes
don't swim. Your book says so.

530
01:53:52,957 --> 01:53:58,707
Please, buy me a drink.
Buy me a drink over there.

531
01:54:01,166 --> 01:54:03,457
OK.

532
01:54:06,749 --> 01:54:09,874
What's the matter?

533
01:54:10,041 --> 01:54:15,541
Déjà vu. I don't know where,
but I've seen this view before.

534
01:54:50,041 --> 01:54:53,249
Here.

535
01:54:53,416 --> 01:54:57,249
We don't want to get shot as looters.

536
01:54:57,416 --> 01:55:01,832
OK, get smashed.

537
01:55:01,999 --> 01:55:07,041
How about that nice offer
you made me? Do you still want me?

538
01:55:09,999 --> 01:55:16,041
Look, chinchilla.
Looks great on you.

539
01:55:16,207 --> 01:55:21,291
I asked you a question.

540
01:55:21,457 --> 01:55:25,332
- You know what I earn?
- Do you think I need furs?

541
01:55:25,499 --> 01:55:31,666
Yes. Excitement is in your blood
like dope.

542
01:55:33,416 --> 01:55:38,207
You're going to need new fixes
I'm not able to give you.

543
01:55:38,374 --> 01:55:41,707
Don't be stupid.

544
01:56:18,999 --> 01:56:21,791
It's OK.

545
01:56:23,707 --> 01:56:29,207
Probably some National Guardsman
ran his tank into a powerhouse.

546
01:56:29,374 --> 01:56:32,582
Do you remember that black-out?

547
01:56:32,749 --> 01:56:38,207
And all the babies born
exactly nine months later?

548
01:56:38,374 --> 01:56:43,166
Well, here's to all the future
sons and daughters of King Kong.

549
01:56:44,416 --> 01:56:47,416
I'll drink to that.

550
01:56:49,957 --> 01:56:56,707
The hell with furs. Tell me,
does that nice offer still stand?

551
01:56:58,499 --> 01:57:05,291
It depends on Kong. He's bigger
than both of us, know what I mean?

552
01:57:05,457 --> 01:57:08,374
Don't tease me, I'm serious.

553
01:57:14,166 --> 01:57:18,374
Of course. I know
where I've seen that view before.

554
01:57:31,457 --> 01:57:36,332
I think we've got a chance. Sit tight,
I've got to make a phone call.

555
01:57:37,749 --> 01:57:41,541
Keep it down, everyone.

556
01:57:41,707 --> 01:57:45,749
What do you think?
Is he flipped out or not?

557
01:57:45,916 --> 01:57:50,582
Hello? Hello...

558
01:57:50,749 --> 01:57:54,416
Excuse me, Professor. You say
you know where Kong is headed.

559
01:57:54,582 --> 01:57:58,249
Yes.
You can trap him without danger.

560
01:57:58,416 --> 01:58:02,916
Get some helicopters and
blasting nets on top of him.

561
01:58:03,082 --> 01:58:08,582
No problem. Where is he headed,
Professor Prescott?

562
01:58:08,749 --> 01:58:14,499
Promise me to capture him
without injury and I'll tell you.

563
01:58:23,624 --> 01:58:27,832
- Do we have a deal?
- Yes, Professor.

564
01:58:27,999 --> 01:58:30,541
Where is Kong heading?

565
01:58:30,707 --> 01:58:36,416
A place in Manhattan that looks
exactly like his natural habitat.

566
01:58:36,582 --> 01:58:40,874
Let him climb to the top of
the World Trade Center.

567
01:59:20,207 --> 01:59:23,124
Jack!

568
01:59:53,249 --> 01:59:58,499
He's coming down Fifth Avenue
on schedule.

569
01:59:58,666 --> 02:00:04,249
The power is back on.
Keep quiet, get in the shadows.

570
02:00:46,666 --> 02:00:49,041
No.

571
02:01:47,332 --> 02:01:49,957
Hold on! Close your eyes!

572
02:01:50,124 --> 02:01:54,291
The helicopters are coming
to net him!

573
02:02:39,374 --> 02:02:41,999
Hold on!

574
02:04:02,749 --> 02:04:05,499
Kong...

575
02:04:38,749 --> 02:04:43,332
What are those men doing up there?
Didn't they get my orders?

576
02:06:05,416 --> 02:06:08,041
The rotten bastards!

577
02:06:26,124 --> 02:06:32,541
He's still got the girl. Follow me
in a tight holding pattern.

578
02:06:53,416 --> 02:06:57,707
No! Don't put me down.

579
02:06:57,874 --> 02:07:01,624
Hold on to me.

580
02:07:04,082 --> 02:07:07,999
Hold on to me, or they'll kill you.

581
02:07:15,166 --> 02:07:17,791
Now!

582
02:07:25,374 --> 02:07:27,832
Oh, God.

583
02:07:43,541 --> 02:07:45,916
Wait.

584
02:07:53,791 --> 02:07:56,499
Hold on to me.

585
02:07:56,666 --> 02:08:00,582
Please don't let me go.

586
02:08:13,124 --> 02:08:15,416
Don't kill him!

587
02:08:18,166 --> 02:08:20,666
Don't kill him!

588
02:08:33,207 --> 02:08:35,874
Assholes!

589
02:09:41,374 --> 02:09:43,916
Kong.

590
02:11:32,541 --> 02:11:35,374
Dwan!

591
02:11:35,541 --> 02:11:37,916
Jack!

592
02:11:39,749 --> 02:11:42,832
Jack!
