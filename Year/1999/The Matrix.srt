1
00:00:49,142 --> 00:00:52,562
<i>- Is everything in place?</i>
<i>- You weren't supposed to relieve me,</i>

2
00:00:52,813 --> 00:00:55,440
<i>I know, but I felt like taking a shift,</i>

3
00:00:55,983 --> 00:00:58,360
<i>You like him, don't you?</i>
<i>You like watching him,</i>

4
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,613
<i>- Don't be ridiculous,</i>
<i>- We're gonna kill him, You understand?</i>

5
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:04,366
<i>Morpheus believes he is the One,</i>

6
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:07,536
<i>- Do you?</i>
<i>- It doesn't matter what I believe,</i>

7
00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:09,413
<i>You don't, do you?</i>

8
00:01:09,663 --> 00:01:11,748
<i>- Did you hear that?</i>
<i>- Hear what?</i>

9
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:13,583
<i>Are you sure this line is clean?</i>

10
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:15,836
<i>Yeah, of course I'm sure,</i>

11
00:01:16,169 --> 00:01:17,629
<i>I better go,</i>

12
00:01:55,584 --> 00:01:57,377
- Freeze! Police!
- Hands on your head!

13
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,004
Do it! Do it now!

14
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,735
Lieutenant.

15
00:02:21,902 --> 00:02:23,028
Oh, shit.

16
00:02:23,862 --> 00:02:27,074
Lieutenant, you were given
specific orders.

17
00:02:27,324 --> 00:02:29,034
I'm just doing my job.

18
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,081
You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"
crap, you can cram it up your ass.

19
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:37,042
The orders were for your protection.

20
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:40,754
I think we can handle one little girl.

21
00:02:45,884 --> 00:02:47,636
I sent two units!

22
00:02:47,886 --> 00:02:49,471
They're bringing her down now!

23
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:52,849
No, Lieutenant, your men
are already dead.

24
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,005
Shit.

25
00:03:25,632 --> 00:03:28,010
Morpheus, the line was traced.
I don't know how.

26
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,845
<i>I know, They cut the hard line,</i>

27
00:03:30,095 --> 00:03:32,264
<i>There's no time,</i>
<i>Get to another exit,</i>

28
00:03:32,514 --> 00:03:34,933
- Are there any agents?
<i>- Yes,</i>

29
00:03:35,142 --> 00:03:36,310
Goddamn it.

30
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,103
<i>You have to focus, Trinity,</i>

31
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:40,731
<i>There's a phone at Wells and Lake,</i>

32
00:03:41,106 --> 00:03:42,774
<i>You can make it,</i>

33
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:44,693
- All right.
<i>- Go,</i>

34
00:04:46,838 --> 00:04:47,881
That's impossible.

35
00:05:22,874 --> 00:05:24,918
Get up, Trinity.
Just get up.

36
00:05:25,544 --> 00:05:26,753
Get up.

37
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:14,134
She got out.

38
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:15,719
It doesn't matter.

39
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:18,055
The informant is real.

40
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:21,058
We have the name of their next target.

41
00:06:21,308 --> 00:06:22,976
The name is Neo.

42
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:27,773
We'll need a search running.

43
00:06:28,065 --> 00:06:29,983
It has already begun.

44
00:07:24,746 --> 00:07:25,956
What?

45
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,213
What the hell?

46
00:07:40,846 --> 00:07:42,806
"Follow the white rabbit."

47
00:07:54,651 --> 00:07:55,819
Who is it?

48
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:57,362
It's Choi.

49
00:08:10,876 --> 00:08:12,044
You're two hours late.

50
00:08:12,628 --> 00:08:14,379
I know. It's her fault.

51
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:16,715
You got the money?

52
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:18,926
Two grand.

53
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:20,928
Hold on.

54
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:39,988
Hallelujah.

55
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:43,116
You're my savior.
My own personal Jesus Christ.

56
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:45,243
You get caught using that...

57
00:08:45,494 --> 00:08:47,621
I know. This never happened.
You don't exist.

58
00:08:48,747 --> 00:08:50,832
- Right.
- Something wrong, man?

59
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,126
You look a little whiter than usual.

60
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:56,421
My computer, it...

61
00:08:59,424 --> 00:09:03,971
Ever have that feeling where you're
not sure if you're awake or dreaming?

62
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:07,516
All the time.
It's called mescaline.

63
00:09:08,016 --> 00:09:10,143
It's the only way to fly.

64
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:13,522
It just sounds like you
need to unplug.

65
00:09:14,273 --> 00:09:16,316
Get some R and R?

66
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:20,445
What do you think, Dujour?
Should we take him with us?

67
00:09:22,447 --> 00:09:23,657
Definitely.

68
00:09:23,865 --> 00:09:27,035
No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.

69
00:09:27,577 --> 00:09:28,704
Come on.

70
00:09:28,954 --> 00:09:31,581
It'll be fun. I promise.

71
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:39,590
Yeah.

72
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:42,301
Sure. I'll go.

73
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,954
Hello, Neo.

74
00:10:12,497 --> 00:10:16,001
- How do you know that name?
- I know a lot about you.

75
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:18,962
- Who are you?
- My name is Trinity.

76
00:10:19,922 --> 00:10:21,131
Trinity.

77
00:10:22,925 --> 00:10:26,094
The Trinity?
That cracked the IRS D-base?

78
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:27,804
That was a long time ago.

79
00:10:28,055 --> 00:10:29,973
- Jesus.
- What?

80
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:32,225
I just thought...

81
00:10:33,977 --> 00:10:35,145
...you were a guy.

82
00:10:35,395 --> 00:10:36,855
Most guys do.

83
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:40,275
That was you on my computer.

84
00:10:40,901 --> 00:10:42,027
How did you do that?

85
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:45,364
Right now, all I can tell you...

86
00:10:45,989 --> 00:10:47,532
...is that you're in danger.

87
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:50,410
- I brought you here to warn you.
- Of what?

88
00:10:50,994 --> 00:10:52,663
They're watching you, Neo.

89
00:10:53,246 --> 00:10:55,666
- Who is?
- Please just listen.

90
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:01,004
I know why you're here, Neo.

91
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:03,757
I know what you've been doing.

92
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:05,884
I know why you hardly sleep...

93
00:11:06,176 --> 00:11:09,304
...why you live alone and why,
night after night...

94
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:11,890
...you sit at your computer.

95
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:14,601
You're looking for him.

96
00:11:15,394 --> 00:11:18,397
I know, because I was once
looking for the same thing.

97
00:11:18,897 --> 00:11:21,024
And when he found me...

98
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,736
...he told me I wasn't really
looking for him...

99
00:11:25,654 --> 00:11:27,406
...I was looking for an answer.

100
00:11:28,031 --> 00:11:31,159
It's the question that drives us, Neo.

101
00:11:31,827 --> 00:11:34,496
It's the question
that brought you here.

102
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:37,958
You know the question...

103
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,710
...just as I did.

104
00:11:41,253 --> 00:11:42,879
What is the Matrix?

105
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,591
The answer is out there, Neo.

106
00:11:46,258 --> 00:11:48,260
It's looking for you.

107
00:11:49,052 --> 00:11:50,762
And it will find you...

108
00:11:51,013 --> 00:11:53,015
...if you want it to.

109
00:11:59,813 --> 00:12:00,856
Shit.

110
00:12:01,023 --> 00:12:02,149
Shit, shit.

111
00:12:12,409 --> 00:12:15,245
You have a problem with authority,
Mr. Anderson.

112
00:12:15,495 --> 00:12:19,541
You believe that you are special,
that the rules do not apply to you.

113
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,252
Obviously, you are mistaken.

114
00:12:25,213 --> 00:12:28,091
This is one of the top
software companies in the world...

115
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:31,720
...because employees understand
they are part of a whole.

116
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:36,600
Thus, if an employee has a problem,
the company has a problem.

117
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:42,064
The time has come to make
a choice, Mr. Anderson.

118
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,818
Either you choose to be at your desk
on time from this day forth...

119
00:12:47,444 --> 00:12:50,030
...or you choose to find another job.

120
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:52,240
Do I make myself clear?

121
00:12:52,491 --> 00:12:54,910
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.
Perfectly clear.

122
00:13:03,377 --> 00:13:05,379
Thomas Anderson?

123
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:07,923
Yeah, that's me.

124
00:13:15,931 --> 00:13:17,099
Great.

125
00:13:18,517 --> 00:13:19,685
Have a nice day.

126
00:13:36,493 --> 00:13:39,830
<i>Hello, Neo, Do you know who this is?</i>

127
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:43,834
- Morpheus.
<i>- Yes,</i>

128
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:46,086
<i>I've been looking for you,</i>

129
00:13:46,336 --> 00:13:49,506
<i>I don't know if you're ready to see</i>
<i>what I want to show you,</i>

130
00:13:49,756 --> 00:13:52,926
<i>But unfortunately, you and I
<i>have run out of time,</i>

131
00:13:53,176 --> 00:13:56,888
<i>They're coming for you, and I don't know</i>
<i>what they're going to do,</i>

132
00:13:57,139 --> 00:13:58,473
Who's coming for me?

133
00:13:58,724 --> 00:14:00,809
<i>Stand up and see for yourself,</i>

134
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:03,854
- What? Right now?
<i>- Yes,</i>

135
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:05,355
<i>Now,</i>

136
00:14:06,231 --> 00:14:08,108
<i>Do it slowly,</i>

137
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:09,735
<i>The elevator,</i>

138
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:16,408
Oh, shit!

139
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:22,205
What do they want?

140
00:14:22,372 --> 00:14:25,792
<i>I don't know, If you don't want</i>
<i>to find out, get out of there,</i>

141
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:27,002
How?

142
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:30,255
<i>I can guide you,</i>
<i>but you must do exactly as I say,</i>

143
00:14:31,131 --> 00:14:33,133
<i>The cubicle across from you is empty,</i>

144
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:38,388
- But what if they...
<i>- Go, Now,</i>

145
00:14:45,145 --> 00:14:47,522
<i>Stay here for just a moment,</i>

146
00:14:54,738 --> 00:14:57,491
<i>When I tell you,</i>
<i>go to the end of the row,,,</i>

147
00:14:57,741 --> 00:14:59,701
<i>,,, to the office</i>
<i>at the end of the hall,</i>

148
00:14:59,952 --> 00:15:02,329
<i>Stay as low as you can,</i>

149
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:05,749
<i>Go, Now,</i>

150
00:15:20,138 --> 00:15:23,684
<i>Good, Now, outside</i>
<i>there is a scaffold,</i>

151
00:15:26,395 --> 00:15:28,730
- How do you know this?
<i>- We don't have time,</i>

152
00:15:28,981 --> 00:15:31,817
<i>To your left there's a window,</i>
<i>Go to it,</i>

153
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:35,612
<i>Open it,</i>

154
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:38,240
<i>Take the scaffold to the roof,</i>

155
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:41,076
No way! No way!
This is crazy!

156
00:15:41,326 --> 00:15:43,704
<i>There are two ways</i>
<i>out of this building,</i>

157
00:15:43,954 --> 00:15:47,749
<i>One is that scaffold,</i>
<i>The other is in their custody,</i>

158
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,211
<i>You take a chance either way,</i>
<i>I leave it to you,</i>

159
00:15:54,798 --> 00:15:56,550
This is insane!

160
00:15:57,718 --> 00:15:59,595
Why is this happening to me?

161
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:01,513
What'd I do?

162
00:16:01,888 --> 00:16:04,641
I'm nobody.
I didn't do anything.

163
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:06,685
I'm gonna die.

164
00:16:16,486 --> 00:16:17,529
Shit!

165
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:38,926
Oh, shit!

166
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:45,682
I can't do this.

167
00:16:58,278 --> 00:16:59,363
Shit.

168
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,458
As you can see, we've had our eye
on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.

169
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:57,421
It seems that you've been living...

170
00:17:57,671 --> 00:17:59,798
...two lives.

171
00:18:01,216 --> 00:18:03,719
In one life,
you're Thomas A. Anderson...

172
00:18:03,969 --> 00:18:07,306
...program writer for
a respectable software company.

173
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:11,643
You have a social security number.
You pay your taxes.

174
00:18:12,102 --> 00:18:13,353
And you...

175
00:18:14,938 --> 00:18:18,567
...help your landlady
carry out her garbage.

176
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:24,197
The other life is lived in computers...

177
00:18:24,489 --> 00:18:27,451
...where you go by
the hacker alias "Neo"...

178
00:18:27,701 --> 00:18:32,497
...and are guilty of virtually every
computer crime we have a law for.

179
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,751
One of these lives...

180
00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:37,836
...has a future.

181
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,172
And one of them does not.

182
00:18:43,884 --> 00:18:47,721
I'm going to be as forthcoming
as I can be, Mr. Anderson.

183
00:18:48,722 --> 00:18:50,057
You're here...

184
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,643
...because we need your help.

185
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:59,274
We know that you've been contacted
by a certain...

186
00:18:59,524 --> 00:19:01,318
...individual.

187
00:19:02,235 --> 00:19:06,281
A man who calls himself "Morpheus."

188
00:19:07,282 --> 00:19:11,286
Whatever you think you know
about this man is irrelevant.

189
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:13,956
He is considered by many authorities...

190
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:17,251
...to be the most dangerous man alive.

191
00:19:20,003 --> 00:19:21,213
My colleagues...

192
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,549
...believe that I am wasting
my time with you.

193
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:28,262
But I believe you wish
to do the right thing.

194
00:19:28,553 --> 00:19:32,057
We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

195
00:19:32,432 --> 00:19:34,559
...give you a fresh start.

196
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,980
All we're asking in return
is your cooperation...

197
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,733
...in bringing
a known terrorist to justice.

198
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,361
Yeah.

199
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:47,739
That sounds like a really good deal.

200
00:19:49,366 --> 00:19:51,118
But I got a better one.

201
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:52,869
How about...

202
00:19:53,287 --> 00:19:55,289
...I give you the finger...

203
00:19:57,874 --> 00:19:59,918
...and you give me my phone call.

204
00:20:02,087 --> 00:20:03,922
Mr. Anderson...

205
00:20:07,884 --> 00:20:09,136
...you disappoint me.

206
00:20:09,386 --> 00:20:12,014
You can't scare me
with this gestapo crap.

207
00:20:12,264 --> 00:20:13,640
I know my rights.

208
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,392
I want my phone call.

209
00:20:15,976 --> 00:20:18,145
Tell me, Mr. Anderson...

210
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:20,439
...what good is a phone call...

211
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:24,276
...if you're unable to speak?

212
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,270
You're going to help us,
Mr. Anderson...

213
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:03,065
...whether you want to or not.

214
00:22:01,373 --> 00:22:04,626
<i>This line is tapped,</i>
<i>so I must be brief,</i>

215
00:22:04,876 --> 00:22:09,172
<i>They got to you first, but they've</i>
<i>underestimated how important you are,</i>

216
00:22:09,423 --> 00:22:11,258
<i>If they knew what I know,,,</i>

217
00:22:11,508 --> 00:22:13,510
<i>,,, you would probably be dead,</i>

218
00:22:14,511 --> 00:22:18,223
What are you talking about?
What is happening to me?

219
00:22:18,473 --> 00:22:23,312
<i>You are the One, Neo, You may have</i>
<i>spent the last few years,,,</i>

220
00:22:23,562 --> 00:22:26,523
<i>,,, looking for me, but I've spent</i>
<i>my entire life,,,</i>

221
00:22:26,773 --> 00:22:28,275
<i>,,, looking for you,</i>

222
00:22:29,818 --> 00:22:31,987
<i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>

223
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:35,824
- Yes.
<i>- Then go to the Adams Street bridge,</i>

224
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:47,252
Get in.

225
00:22:59,514 --> 00:23:03,143
- What's this?
- It's necessary, Neo. For our protection.

226
00:23:03,393 --> 00:23:05,562
- From what?
- From you.

227
00:23:07,105 --> 00:23:08,565
Take off your shirt.

228
00:23:08,899 --> 00:23:10,859
Stop the car.

229
00:23:14,488 --> 00:23:15,656
Listen, coppertop.

230
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:17,908
We don't have time for 20 Questions.

231
00:23:18,408 --> 00:23:20,786
Right now, there's only one rule:

232
00:23:21,078 --> 00:23:22,412
Our way...

233
00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:23,830
...or the highway.

234
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:31,463
Fine.

235
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,801
Please, Neo, you have to trust me.

236
00:23:36,385 --> 00:23:39,012
- Why?
- Because you have been down there.

237
00:23:39,763 --> 00:23:40,973
You know that road.

238
00:23:41,974 --> 00:23:43,642
You know exactly where it ends.

239
00:23:45,811 --> 00:23:48,063
And I know that's
not where you want to be.

240
00:24:02,244 --> 00:24:03,787
Apoc, lights.

241
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,458
Lie back.
Lift up your shirt.

242
00:24:10,377 --> 00:24:12,629
- What's that?
- You're bugged.

243
00:24:20,387 --> 00:24:21,847
Try and relax.

244
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:29,313
Come on.

245
00:24:30,522 --> 00:24:32,566
Come on.

246
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:35,235
It's on the move.

247
00:24:35,944 --> 00:24:37,154
Come on, you shit.

248
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:41,074
- You're gonna lose it.
- No, I'm not.

249
00:24:41,241 --> 00:24:42,492
Clear!

250
00:24:51,084 --> 00:24:53,211
Jesus Christ!
That thing's real?!

251
00:25:26,954 --> 00:25:28,288
This is it.

252
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:34,086
Let me give you one piece of advice.

253
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:36,713
Be honest.

254
00:25:38,298 --> 00:25:40,509
He knows more than you can imagine.

255
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:50,560
At last.

256
00:25:52,104 --> 00:25:53,188
Welcome, Neo.

257
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:56,316
As you no doubt have guessed...

258
00:25:56,566 --> 00:25:57,818
...I am Morpheus.

259
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,445
It's an honor to meet you.

260
00:26:00,904 --> 00:26:01,947
No...

261
00:26:02,531 --> 00:26:03,824
...the honor is mine.

262
00:26:04,741 --> 00:26:07,244
Please, come. Sit.

263
00:26:22,342 --> 00:26:23,969
I imagine...

264
00:26:24,386 --> 00:26:27,139
...that right now you're feeling
a bit like Alice...

265
00:26:28,849 --> 00:26:31,268
...tumbling down the rabbit hole?

266
00:26:32,185 --> 00:26:33,937
You could say that.

267
00:26:34,104 --> 00:26:36,732
I can see it in your eyes.

268
00:26:37,316 --> 00:26:40,611
You have the look of a man
who accepts what he sees...

269
00:26:40,861 --> 00:26:43,113
...because he's expecting to wake up.

270
00:26:44,531 --> 00:26:47,159
Ironically, this is not
far from the truth.

271
00:26:47,826 --> 00:26:50,329
Do you believe in fate, Neo?

272
00:26:50,621 --> 00:26:52,915
- No.
- Why not?

273
00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:55,959
I don't like the idea that
I'm not in control of my life.

274
00:26:57,044 --> 00:27:00,380
I know exactly what you mean.

275
00:27:04,676 --> 00:27:07,054
Let me tell you why you're here.

276
00:27:08,096 --> 00:27:09,640
You know something.

277
00:27:10,182 --> 00:27:11,808
What you know,
you can't explain.

278
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:13,894
But you feel it.

279
00:27:14,478 --> 00:27:16,396
You felt it your entire life.

280
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,151
Something's wrong with the world.
You don't know what, but it's there.

281
00:27:21,652 --> 00:27:23,862
Like a splinter in your mind...

282
00:27:24,112 --> 00:27:25,989
...driving you mad.

283
00:27:26,907 --> 00:27:29,660
It is this feeling
that has brought you to me.

284
00:27:32,204 --> 00:27:34,039
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

285
00:27:35,874 --> 00:27:37,209
The Matrix?

286
00:27:39,711 --> 00:27:41,380
Do you want to know...

287
00:27:41,838 --> 00:27:43,840
...what it is?

288
00:27:46,218 --> 00:27:48,095
The Matrix is everywhere.

289
00:27:48,345 --> 00:27:50,055
It is all around us.

290
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:52,266
Even now, in this very room.

291
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,310
You can see it when you
look out your window...

292
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,896
...or when you turn on your television.

293
00:27:58,313 --> 00:28:00,857
You can feel it when you go to work...

294
00:28:02,401 --> 00:28:04,069
...when you go to church...

295
00:28:04,486 --> 00:28:06,571
...when you pay your taxes.

296
00:28:07,698 --> 00:28:10,617
It is the world that has been
pulled over your eyes...

297
00:28:10,867 --> 00:28:12,452
...to blind you from the truth.

298
00:28:14,663 --> 00:28:15,914
What truth?

299
00:28:20,168 --> 00:28:21,712
That you are a slave.

300
00:28:23,213 --> 00:28:25,507
Like everyone else,
you were born into bondage...

301
00:28:25,757 --> 00:28:30,429
...born into a prison that you cannot
smell or taste or touch.

302
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:32,014
A prison...

303
00:28:32,264 --> 00:28:33,432
...for your mind.

304
00:28:40,397 --> 00:28:42,733
Unfortunately, no one can be...

305
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:45,444
...told what the Matrix is.

306
00:28:48,905 --> 00:28:50,782
You have to see it for yourself.

307
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:02,586
This is your last chance.

308
00:29:02,836 --> 00:29:05,172
After this, there is no turning back.

309
00:29:05,631 --> 00:29:07,132
You take the blue pill...

310
00:29:07,424 --> 00:29:10,469
...the story ends, you wake up
in your bed and believe...

311
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:12,512
...whatever you want to believe.

312
00:29:12,763 --> 00:29:14,097
You take the red pill...

313
00:29:14,348 --> 00:29:16,308
...you stay in Wonderland...

314
00:29:16,808 --> 00:29:19,519
...and I show you how deep
the rabbit hole goes.

315
00:29:29,404 --> 00:29:30,614
Remember...

316
00:29:31,448 --> 00:29:34,493
...all I'm offering is the truth.
Nothing more.

317
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,133
Follow me.

318
00:29:52,678 --> 00:29:54,346
Apoc, are we on-line?

319
00:29:54,596 --> 00:29:55,973
Almost.

320
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:01,353
Time is always against us.

321
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,230
Please take a seat there.

322
00:30:21,415 --> 00:30:23,125
You did all this?

323
00:30:27,254 --> 00:30:29,256
The pill you took is
part of a trace program.

324
00:30:30,007 --> 00:30:34,636
It disrupts your carrier signals
so we can pinpoint your location.

325
00:30:35,178 --> 00:30:36,221
What does that mean?

326
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:38,974
It means buckle your
seat belt, Dorothy...

327
00:30:39,308 --> 00:30:40,642
...because Kansas...

328
00:30:40,892 --> 00:30:41,935
...is going bye-bye.

329
00:31:19,848 --> 00:31:21,224
Did you...?

330
00:31:32,235 --> 00:31:36,323
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?

331
00:31:37,783 --> 00:31:40,369
What if you were unable
to wake from that dream?

332
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:43,121
How would you know the difference
between the dream world...

333
00:31:43,747 --> 00:31:45,165
...and the real world?

334
00:31:46,792 --> 00:31:49,169
- This can't be.
- Be what?

335
00:31:49,878 --> 00:31:51,380
Be real?

336
00:31:55,342 --> 00:31:56,635
Going into replication.

337
00:31:57,094 --> 00:31:59,763
- Still nothing.
- It's cold.

338
00:32:00,013 --> 00:32:01,390
It's cold!

339
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:06,937
Tank, we'll need a signal soon.

340
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,108
- I got a fibrillation.
- Apoc, location.

341
00:32:11,358 --> 00:32:12,818
Targeting almost there.

342
00:32:16,113 --> 00:32:17,531
He's going into arrest.

343
00:32:17,781 --> 00:32:20,284
- Lock. I got him!
- Now, Tank, now!

344
00:35:17,544 --> 00:35:18,629
Welcome...

345
00:35:18,962 --> 00:35:20,881
...to the real world.

346
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:24,134
We've done it, Trinity.

347
00:35:24,384 --> 00:35:25,928
We found him.

348
00:35:26,178 --> 00:35:28,972
- I hope you're right.
- I don't have to hope.

349
00:35:29,556 --> 00:35:31,141
I know it.

350
00:35:36,313 --> 00:35:37,356
Am I dead?

351
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,025
Far from it.

352
00:35:53,997 --> 00:35:55,415
He still needs a lot of work.

353
00:35:56,959 --> 00:35:58,043
What are you doing?

354
00:35:58,293 --> 00:36:00,504
Your muscles atrophied.
We're rebuilding them.

355
00:36:01,088 --> 00:36:02,631
Why do my eyes hurt?

356
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,217
You've never used them before.

357
00:36:09,179 --> 00:36:11,932
Rest, Neo. The answers are coming.

358
00:37:26,506 --> 00:37:28,091
Morpheus, what's happened to me?

359
00:37:28,842 --> 00:37:32,721
- What is this place?
- More important than "what" is "when."

360
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:36,516
- When?
- You believe it's the year 1999...

361
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:39,019
...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.

362
00:37:40,145 --> 00:37:42,898
I can't tell you exactly
what year it is...

363
00:37:43,148 --> 00:37:44,775
...because we honestly don't know.

364
00:37:45,275 --> 00:37:48,111
There's nothing I can say
that will explain it for you.

365
00:37:48,362 --> 00:37:49,529
Come with me.

366
00:37:49,821 --> 00:37:51,114
See for yourself.

367
00:37:51,657 --> 00:37:53,408
This is my ship.

368
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,620
The <i>Nebuchadnezzar,</i>
It's a hovercraft.

369
00:37:59,456 --> 00:38:01,208
This is the main deck.

370
00:38:07,047 --> 00:38:08,215
This is the core...

371
00:38:10,717 --> 00:38:14,471
...where we broadcast our pirate signal
and hack into the Matrix.

372
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:21,019
Most of my crew you already know.

373
00:38:26,024 --> 00:38:27,442
This is Apoc...

374
00:38:28,235 --> 00:38:29,569
...Switch...

375
00:38:31,154 --> 00:38:32,322
...and Cypher.

376
00:38:32,572 --> 00:38:36,285
The ones you don't know:
Tank and his big brother, Dozer.

377
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,580
The little one behind you is Mouse.

378
00:38:43,917 --> 00:38:47,170
You wanted to know
what the Matrix is?

379
00:38:48,213 --> 00:38:49,423
Trinity.

380
00:39:10,444 --> 00:39:12,029
Try to relax.

381
00:39:16,908 --> 00:39:18,744
This will feel a little weird.

382
00:39:30,714 --> 00:39:31,882
This...

383
00:39:32,257 --> 00:39:33,967
...is the Construct.

384
00:39:34,384 --> 00:39:36,511
It's our loading program.

385
00:39:36,762 --> 00:39:39,222
We can load anything, from clothing...

386
00:39:39,473 --> 00:39:40,849
...to equipment...

387
00:39:41,141 --> 00:39:42,476
...weapons...

388
00:39:43,101 --> 00:39:44,937
...training simulations...

389
00:39:45,312 --> 00:39:47,856
...anything we need.

390
00:39:50,651 --> 00:39:53,070
Right now we're inside
a computer program?

391
00:39:53,362 --> 00:39:55,280
Is it really so hard to believe?

392
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:58,408
Your clothes are different.
The plugs in your body are gone.

393
00:39:59,618 --> 00:40:01,703
Your hair has changed.

394
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,415
Your appearance now is what we call
"residual self-image."

395
00:40:06,124 --> 00:40:08,752
It is the mental projection
of your digital self.

396
00:40:14,633 --> 00:40:15,759
This isn't real?

397
00:40:16,009 --> 00:40:17,552
What is "real"?

398
00:40:17,928 --> 00:40:20,180
How do you define "real"?

399
00:40:20,472 --> 00:40:22,391
If you're talking about
what you can feel...

400
00:40:22,641 --> 00:40:25,060
...what you can smell, taste and see...

401
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:29,189
...then "real" is simply electrical
signals interpreted by your brain.

402
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,779
This is the world that you know.

403
00:40:37,197 --> 00:40:40,242
The world as it was at the end
of the 20th century.

404
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:46,957
It exists now only as part of
a neural-interactive simulation...

405
00:40:47,207 --> 00:40:48,458
...that we call the Matrix.

406
00:40:53,005 --> 00:40:55,841
You've been living
in a dream world, Neo.

407
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,926
This is the world...

408
00:40:58,218 --> 00:41:00,012
...as it exists today.

409
00:41:13,025 --> 00:41:15,986
Welcome to "the desert...

410
00:41:16,862 --> 00:41:18,447
...of the real."

411
00:41:21,825 --> 00:41:24,202
We have only bits and pieces
of information.

412
00:41:24,453 --> 00:41:28,248
But what we know for certain
is that in the early 21 st century...

413
00:41:28,498 --> 00:41:31,752
...all of mankind was united
in celebration.

414
00:41:32,002 --> 00:41:36,757
We marveled at our own magnificence
as we gave birth to Al.

415
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:38,675
Al.

416
00:41:39,718 --> 00:41:41,094
You mean artificial intelligence.

417
00:41:41,345 --> 00:41:45,766
A singular consciousness that spawned
an entire race of machines.

418
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:50,062
We don't know who struck first,
us or them.

419
00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:53,690
But we know that it was us
that scorched the sky.

420
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,527
They were dependent on solar power...

421
00:41:57,778 --> 00:42:01,114
...and it was believed that
they would be unable to survive...

422
00:42:01,448 --> 00:42:04,952
...without an energy source
as abundant as the sun.

423
00:42:05,202 --> 00:42:10,082
Throughout human history, we have been
dependent on machines to survive.

424
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:15,754
Fate, it seems, is not
without a sense of irony.

425
00:42:18,966 --> 00:42:23,387
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.

426
00:42:23,637 --> 00:42:27,766
And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.

427
00:42:29,685 --> 00:42:31,853
Combined with a form of fusion...

428
00:42:32,187 --> 00:42:37,025
...the machines had found all the energy
they would ever need.

429
00:42:41,071 --> 00:42:44,825
There are fields, Neo,
endless fields...

430
00:42:45,075 --> 00:42:48,328
...where human beings
are no longer born.

431
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:50,872
We are grown.

432
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:59,506
For the longest time,
I wouldn't believe it.

433
00:42:59,756 --> 00:43:02,426
And then I saw the fields
with my own eyes...

434
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,387
...watched them liquefy the dead...

435
00:43:05,637 --> 00:43:08,974
...so they could be fed intravenously
to the living.

436
00:43:09,516 --> 00:43:13,770
And standing there,
facing the pure, horrifying precision...

437
00:43:14,021 --> 00:43:16,940
...I came to realize
the obviousness of the truth.

438
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:21,361
What is the Matrix?

439
00:43:22,571 --> 00:43:23,614
Control.

440
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:28,368
The Matrix is a computer-generated
dream world...

441
00:43:29,161 --> 00:43:32,247
...built to keep us under control...

442
00:43:33,415 --> 00:43:36,585
...in order to change a human being...

443
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,378
...into this.

444
00:43:39,755 --> 00:43:40,881
No.

445
00:43:42,507 --> 00:43:44,092
I don't believe it.

446
00:43:44,468 --> 00:43:45,677
It's not possible.

447
00:43:46,261 --> 00:43:50,849
I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.
I just said it would be the truth.

448
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:52,684
Stop!

449
00:43:52,935 --> 00:43:54,144
Let me out!

450
00:43:54,853 --> 00:43:56,772
Let me out! I want out!

451
00:43:58,732 --> 00:44:01,401
- Easy, Neo. Easy.
- Get this thing out of me.

452
00:44:01,652 --> 00:44:03,320
Get this thing out of me!

453
00:44:05,113 --> 00:44:06,615
Don't touch me!

454
00:44:06,865 --> 00:44:08,492
Stay away from me!

455
00:44:08,909 --> 00:44:10,410
I don't believe it.

456
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,329
I don't believe it.

457
00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:14,164
I don't believe it.

458
00:44:14,331 --> 00:44:17,834
- He's gonna pop.
- Breathe, Neo. Just breathe.

459
00:44:36,228 --> 00:44:38,021
I can't go back, can I?

460
00:44:38,605 --> 00:44:39,940
No.

461
00:44:41,108 --> 00:44:42,317
But if you could...

462
00:44:43,151 --> 00:44:44,653
...would you really want to?

463
00:44:47,155 --> 00:44:48,574
I owe you an apology.

464
00:44:49,116 --> 00:44:50,492
We have a rule.

465
00:44:50,951 --> 00:44:54,329
We never free a mind
once it's reached a certain age.

466
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,874
It's dangerous.
The mind has trouble letting go.

467
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:00,419
I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.

468
00:45:01,461 --> 00:45:03,547
I did what I did because...

469
00:45:04,256 --> 00:45:05,716
...I had to.

470
00:45:14,141 --> 00:45:18,228
When the Matrix was first built,
there was a man born inside...

471
00:45:18,729 --> 00:45:22,524
...who had the ability
to change whatever he wanted...

472
00:45:22,899 --> 00:45:25,819
...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.

473
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:31,033
It was he who freed the first of us...

474
00:45:31,909 --> 00:45:33,535
...taught us the truth.

475
00:45:34,995 --> 00:45:38,081
As long as the Matrix exists...

476
00:45:38,415 --> 00:45:40,500
...the human race will never be free.

477
00:45:44,713 --> 00:45:46,256
After he died...

478
00:45:47,007 --> 00:45:49,718
...the Oracle prophesied his return...

479
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,472
...and that his coming would hail
the destruction of the Matrix...

480
00:45:53,722 --> 00:45:55,390
...end the war...

481
00:45:55,724 --> 00:45:56,934
...bring freedom to our people.

482
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:02,940
That is why there are those of us who
spent our lives searching the Matrix...

483
00:46:03,273 --> 00:46:04,858
...looking for him.

484
00:46:07,277 --> 00:46:09,363
I did what I did because...

485
00:46:10,989 --> 00:46:13,116
...I believe that search is over.

486
00:46:18,205 --> 00:46:19,623
Get some rest.

487
00:46:20,249 --> 00:46:22,042
You're going to need it.

488
00:46:24,795 --> 00:46:26,755
For what?

489
00:46:28,882 --> 00:46:30,050
Your training.

490
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,070
Morning. Did you sleep?

491
00:46:50,946 --> 00:46:52,155
You will tonight.

492
00:46:52,531 --> 00:46:54,074
I guarantee it.

493
00:46:55,576 --> 00:46:57,494
I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

494
00:46:57,953 --> 00:47:00,372
- You don't have any...
- Holes? Nope.

495
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:06,003
Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100º/ pure,
old-fashioned, homegrown human.

496
00:47:06,253 --> 00:47:07,462
Born free right here...

497
00:47:08,005 --> 00:47:09,339
...in the real world.

498
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,258
Genuine child of Zion.

499
00:47:12,092 --> 00:47:14,553
- Zion?
- If the war was over tomorrow...

500
00:47:14,803 --> 00:47:16,221
...Zion's where the party would be.

501
00:47:16,722 --> 00:47:18,015
It's a city?

502
00:47:18,265 --> 00:47:21,435
The last human city.
The only place we have left.

503
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,271
Where is it?

504
00:47:25,647 --> 00:47:27,024
Deep underground...

505
00:47:27,274 --> 00:47:29,443
...near the Earth's core,
where it's still warm.

506
00:47:31,069 --> 00:47:32,946
You live long enough,
you might see it.

507
00:47:35,198 --> 00:47:40,037
Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited
to see what you're capable of...

508
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,039
...if Morpheus is right and all.

509
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:45,292
We're not supposed to
talk about this, but...

510
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:46,960
...if you are...

511
00:47:48,045 --> 00:47:50,047
...it's a very exciting time.

512
00:47:51,089 --> 00:47:53,800
We got a lot to do.
We gotta get to it.

513
00:47:57,721 --> 00:48:00,641
We're supposed to start
with these programs first.

514
00:48:01,642 --> 00:48:05,103
That's major boring shit.
Let's do something more fun.

515
00:48:05,437 --> 00:48:06,939
How about...

516
00:48:08,482 --> 00:48:10,233
...combat training?

517
00:48:16,281 --> 00:48:17,741
"Jujitsu"?

518
00:48:18,617 --> 00:48:20,285
I'm going to learn jujitsu?

519
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:32,839
Holy shit!

520
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:35,425
"Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."

521
00:48:35,759 --> 00:48:37,052
How about some more?

522
00:48:37,302 --> 00:48:38,595
Hell, yes.

523
00:48:40,597 --> 00:48:41,723
Hell, yeah.

524
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:54,987
How is he?

525
00:48:55,237 --> 00:48:57,447
Ten hours straight.
He's a machine.

526
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:10,002
I know kung fu.

527
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:12,713
Show me.

528
00:49:14,464 --> 00:49:16,216
This is a sparring program...

529
00:49:16,466 --> 00:49:19,261
...similar to the programmed reality
of the Matrix.

530
00:49:19,511 --> 00:49:21,847
It has the same basic rules.
Like gravity.

531
00:49:22,097 --> 00:49:25,559
These rules are no different
than those of a computer system.

532
00:49:26,101 --> 00:49:27,603
Some of them can be bent.

533
00:49:27,811 --> 00:49:30,272
Others can be broken.

534
00:49:30,647 --> 00:49:31,898
Understand?

535
00:49:33,191 --> 00:49:35,736
Then hit me, if you can.

536
00:50:14,608 --> 00:50:15,776
Good!

537
00:50:16,526 --> 00:50:17,694
Adaptation.

538
00:50:17,986 --> 00:50:19,196
Improvisation.

539
00:50:19,488 --> 00:50:20,822
But your weakness...

540
00:50:21,073 --> 00:50:22,449
...is not your technique.

541
00:50:29,414 --> 00:50:31,500
Morpheus is fighting Neo.

542
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:44,948
How did I beat you?

543
00:51:51,538 --> 00:51:52,623
You're too fast.

544
00:51:53,165 --> 00:51:54,499
Do you believe that...

545
00:51:54,875 --> 00:51:57,377
...my being stronger or faster...

546
00:51:57,628 --> 00:52:01,298
...has anything to do
with my muscles in this place?

547
00:52:05,344 --> 00:52:07,137
You think you're breathing air?

548
00:52:20,651 --> 00:52:21,860
Again!

549
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:35,749
Jesus Christ, he's fast!

550
00:52:35,999 --> 00:52:38,210
His neuro-kinetics
are way above normal.

551
00:52:43,674 --> 00:52:45,133
What are you waiting for?

552
00:52:45,384 --> 00:52:47,344
You're faster than this.

553
00:52:49,554 --> 00:52:51,765
Don't think you are.

554
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:53,684
Know you are.

555
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:06,905
Come on! Stop trying to hit me,
and hit me!

556
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:18,542
I don't believe it.

557
00:53:20,085 --> 00:53:22,212
I know what you're trying to do.

558
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,049
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.

559
00:53:26,383 --> 00:53:28,468
But I can only show you the door.

560
00:53:29,052 --> 00:53:30,929
You have to walk through it.

561
00:53:33,265 --> 00:53:35,392
Tank, load the jump program.

562
00:53:46,987 --> 00:53:49,698
You have to let it all go, Neo.
Fear...

563
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,409
...doubt and disbelief.

564
00:53:53,577 --> 00:53:56,288
Free your mind.

565
00:54:12,471 --> 00:54:14,181
Okey-dokey.

566
00:54:16,266 --> 00:54:17,434
Free my mind.

567
00:54:17,893 --> 00:54:19,019
What if he makes it?

568
00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:21,980
- No one's ever made their first jump.
- I know.

569
00:54:23,315 --> 00:54:25,776
- But what if he does?
- He won't.

570
00:54:26,276 --> 00:54:27,444
Come on.

571
00:54:27,694 --> 00:54:28,862
All right.

572
00:54:29,321 --> 00:54:31,365
No problem. Free my mind.

573
00:54:32,157 --> 00:54:34,952
Free my mind. No problem. Right.

574
00:54:54,346 --> 00:54:56,014
What does that mean?

575
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:58,225
It doesn't mean anything.

576
00:54:58,809 --> 00:55:01,395
Everybody falls the first time.

577
00:55:01,853 --> 00:55:03,146
Right, Trin?

578
00:55:23,834 --> 00:55:26,461
- I thought it wasn't real.
- Your mind makes it real.

579
00:55:29,715 --> 00:55:31,967
If you're killed in the Matrix...

580
00:55:32,134 --> 00:55:33,176
...you die here?

581
00:55:33,802 --> 00:55:36,263
The body cannot live without the mind.

582
00:56:06,752 --> 00:56:10,130
I don't remember you ever
bringing me dinner.

583
00:56:13,216 --> 00:56:16,053
There is something about him,
isn't there?

584
00:56:16,678 --> 00:56:18,305
You're a believer now?

585
00:56:19,306 --> 00:56:20,515
I keep wondering...

586
00:56:20,766 --> 00:56:24,436
...if Morpheus is so sure,
why not take him to see the Oracle?

587
00:56:25,354 --> 00:56:28,273
Morpheus will take him
when he's ready.

588
00:56:38,075 --> 00:56:39,618
The Matrix is a system, Neo.

589
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:42,663
That system is our enemy.

590
00:56:43,288 --> 00:56:45,624
But when you're inside,
what do you see?

591
00:56:45,874 --> 00:56:49,670
Businessmen, teachers,
lawyers, carpenters.

592
00:56:50,128 --> 00:56:52,714
The very minds of the people
we are trying to save.

593
00:56:52,965 --> 00:56:55,926
But until we do, these people are
a part of that system...

594
00:56:56,176 --> 00:56:59,471
...and that makes them our enemy.
You have to understand...

595
00:56:59,721 --> 00:57:03,058
...most of these people are not
ready to be unplugged.

596
00:57:03,308 --> 00:57:04,893
And many of them are so inert...

597
00:57:05,143 --> 00:57:07,562
...so hopelessly dependent
on the system...

598
00:57:07,813 --> 00:57:10,524
...that they will fight to protect it.

599
00:57:12,025 --> 00:57:15,779
Were you listening to me or looking
at the woman in the red dress?

600
00:57:16,655 --> 00:57:17,698
Look again.

601
00:57:18,949 --> 00:57:20,033
Freeze it.

602
00:57:26,665 --> 00:57:28,292
This isn't the Matrix?

603
00:57:30,085 --> 00:57:33,922
It's another training program
designed to teach you one thing:

604
00:57:34,548 --> 00:57:36,967
If you are not one of us,
you are one of them.

605
00:57:37,509 --> 00:57:40,304
- What are they?
- Sentient programs.

606
00:57:41,054 --> 00:57:45,350
They can move in and out of any software
still hardwired to their system.

607
00:57:45,726 --> 00:57:49,104
That means that anyone
we haven't unplugged...

608
00:57:49,438 --> 00:57:50,772
...is potentially an agent.

609
00:57:51,732 --> 00:57:53,567
Inside the Matrix...

610
00:57:54,151 --> 00:57:55,861
...they are everyone...

611
00:57:56,194 --> 00:57:57,905
...and they are no one.

612
00:57:58,155 --> 00:58:01,283
We have survived by hiding
and running from them...

613
00:58:01,533 --> 00:58:03,160
...but they are the gatekeepers.

614
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:06,371
They're guarding all the doors
and holding all the keys.

615
00:58:06,622 --> 00:58:09,458
Sooner or later, someone will
have to fight them.

616
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:10,834
Someone?

617
00:58:11,168 --> 00:58:12,586
I won't lie to you, Neo.

618
00:58:13,045 --> 00:58:17,883
Every single man or woman who
has fought an agent has died.

619
00:58:18,133 --> 00:58:20,510
But where they have failed,
you will succeed.

620
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:21,762
Why?

621
00:58:22,012 --> 00:58:24,306
I've seen an agent punch
through a concrete wall.

622
00:58:24,556 --> 00:58:28,143
Men have emptied entire clips at them
and hit nothing but air.

623
00:58:28,393 --> 00:58:33,023
Yet their strength and speed are still
based in a world built on rules.

624
00:58:33,273 --> 00:58:34,399
Because of that...

625
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:38,028
...they will never be as strong
or as fast as you can be.

626
00:58:42,324 --> 00:58:44,201
What are you telling me?

627
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:46,370
That I can dodge bullets?

628
00:58:48,372 --> 00:58:49,748
No, Neo.

629
00:58:50,249 --> 00:58:53,168
I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready...

630
00:58:54,044 --> 00:58:55,420
...you won't have to.

631
00:58:59,716 --> 00:59:00,759
<i>We got trouble,</i>

632
00:59:19,653 --> 00:59:22,114
- Did Zion send the warning?
- No, another ship.

633
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:26,660
Shit.

634
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:29,788
- Squiddy's sweeping in quick.
- Squiddy?

635
00:59:29,997 --> 00:59:33,208
A sentinel. A killing machine
designed for one thing.

636
00:59:33,458 --> 00:59:34,668
Search and destroy.

637
00:59:36,003 --> 00:59:37,170
Set her down there.

638
00:59:58,984 --> 01:00:01,111
How are we doing, Tank?

639
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:09,828
Power off-line.

640
01:00:10,329 --> 01:00:12,331
EMP armed...

641
01:00:12,497 --> 01:00:14,374
...and ready.
- EMP?

642
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:16,543
Electromagnetic pulse.

643
01:00:16,793 --> 01:00:19,671
Disables any electrical system
in the blast radius.

644
01:00:19,922 --> 01:00:22,132
It's the only weapon we have
against the machines.

645
01:00:27,930 --> 01:00:31,058
- Where are we?
- Their old service and waste systems.

646
01:00:32,392 --> 01:00:33,435
Sewers.

647
01:00:33,644 --> 01:00:36,355
There used to be cities
that spanned hundreds of miles.

648
01:00:36,855 --> 01:00:38,774
Now these sewers are
all that's left.

649
01:00:39,024 --> 01:00:40,359
Quiet.

650
01:01:24,236 --> 01:01:26,405
You scared the bejesus out of me.

651
01:01:27,489 --> 01:01:29,408
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

652
01:01:32,327 --> 01:01:34,997
- Is that...?
- The Matrix?

653
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:41,336
- Do you always look at it encoded?
- Well, you have to.

654
01:01:41,587 --> 01:01:44,673
The image translators work
for the construct program.

655
01:01:44,923 --> 01:01:48,343
But there's way too much information
to decode the Matrix.

656
01:01:48,594 --> 01:01:51,555
You get used to it.
I don't even see the code.

657
01:01:51,805 --> 01:01:55,225
All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.

658
01:01:56,393 --> 01:01:57,769
Do you...

659
01:01:58,061 --> 01:01:59,146
...want a drink?

660
01:01:59,396 --> 01:02:00,439
Sure.

661
01:02:03,984 --> 01:02:05,444
You know...

662
01:02:06,361 --> 01:02:07,905
...I know what you're thinking.

663
01:02:08,155 --> 01:02:10,282
Because right now I'm thinking
the same thing.

664
01:02:10,574 --> 01:02:13,911
Actually, I've been thinking it
ever since I got here.

665
01:02:15,829 --> 01:02:18,832
Why, oh, why didn't I take
the blue pill?

666
01:02:31,219 --> 01:02:33,138
Good shit, huh?

667
01:02:33,472 --> 01:02:34,681
Dozer makes it.

668
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:36,308
It's good for two things:

669
01:02:36,558 --> 01:02:39,645
Degreasing engines and
killing brain cells.

670
01:02:40,646 --> 01:02:42,856
So can I ask you something?

671
01:02:45,859 --> 01:02:47,486
Did he tell you why he did it?

672
01:02:50,113 --> 01:02:51,949
Why you're here?

673
01:02:55,619 --> 01:02:57,371
Jesus!

674
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,499
What a mind job.

675
01:03:01,917 --> 01:03:04,711
So you're here to save the world.

676
01:03:06,213 --> 01:03:08,298
What do you say
to something like that?

677
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:14,846
A little piece of advice.

678
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,058
You see an agent...

679
01:03:18,392 --> 01:03:20,686
...you do what we do:

680
01:03:21,019 --> 01:03:22,562
Run.

681
01:03:22,896 --> 01:03:24,648
You run your ass off.

682
01:03:31,905 --> 01:03:33,615
Thanks for the drink.

683
01:03:38,328 --> 01:03:39,496
Sweet dreams.

684
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:46,920
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?

685
01:03:47,588 --> 01:03:48,714
You know...

686
01:03:50,132 --> 01:03:52,593
...I know this steak doesn't exist.

687
01:03:53,594 --> 01:03:56,346
I know that when I put it
in my mouth...

688
01:03:56,597 --> 01:03:59,683
...the Matrix is telling my brain
that it is...

689
01:03:59,975 --> 01:04:01,101
...juicy...

690
01:04:01,393 --> 01:04:03,103
...and delicious.

691
01:04:06,023 --> 01:04:07,274
After nine years...

692
01:04:08,317 --> 01:04:09,860
...you know what I realize?

693
01:04:17,701 --> 01:04:18,911
Ignorance is bliss.

694
01:04:23,957 --> 01:04:25,792
Then we have a deal.

695
01:04:28,295 --> 01:04:30,213
I don't want to remember nothing.

696
01:04:30,464 --> 01:04:33,008
Nothing. You understand?

697
01:04:37,054 --> 01:04:38,847
And I want to be rich.

698
01:04:40,182 --> 01:04:42,893
You know, someone important.

699
01:04:44,394 --> 01:04:45,520
Like an actor.

700
01:04:46,730 --> 01:04:49,858
Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.

701
01:04:52,027 --> 01:04:53,570
Okay.

702
01:04:53,946 --> 01:04:56,365
You get my body
back in a power plant...

703
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:58,492
...reinsert me into the Matrix...

704
01:04:58,825 --> 01:05:00,244
...I'll get you what you want.

705
01:05:00,494 --> 01:05:02,496
Access codes to the Zion mainframe.

706
01:05:02,746 --> 01:05:04,915
No. I told you, I don't know them.

707
01:05:07,876 --> 01:05:09,878
I can get you the man who does.

708
01:05:10,629 --> 01:05:12,422
Morpheus.

709
01:05:22,516 --> 01:05:25,978
Here you go, buddy.
Breakfast of champions.

710
01:05:27,312 --> 01:05:30,107
Close your eyes, it feels
like you're eating runny eggs.

711
01:05:30,357 --> 01:05:32,359
Or a bowl of snot.

712
01:05:32,568 --> 01:05:34,152
You know what it reminds me of?

713
01:05:35,988 --> 01:05:38,323
Tastee Wheat. Did you
ever eat Tastee Wheat?

714
01:05:38,949 --> 01:05:40,659
No, but technically,
neither did you.

715
01:05:40,909 --> 01:05:42,953
That's exactly my point. Exactly.

716
01:05:43,203 --> 01:05:44,580
Because you have to wonder...

717
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:48,083
...how do the machines really know
what Tastee Wheat tasted like?

718
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:49,751
Maybe they got it wrong.

719
01:05:50,002 --> 01:05:53,213
Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat
tasted like actually tasted like...

720
01:05:53,505 --> 01:05:55,507
...oatmeal or tuna fish.

721
01:05:55,882 --> 01:05:58,719
That makes you wonder.
Take chicken, for example.

722
01:05:58,969 --> 01:06:00,971
Maybe they didn't know
what to make it taste like...

723
01:06:01,221 --> 01:06:03,265
...which is why it tastes
like everything.

724
01:06:03,515 --> 01:06:05,309
- And maybe they...
- Shut up.

725
01:06:06,935 --> 01:06:08,395
It's a single-celled protein...

726
01:06:08,645 --> 01:06:11,690
...combined with synthetic aminos,
vitamins and minerals.

727
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,191
Everything the body needs.

728
01:06:13,442 --> 01:06:16,320
It doesn't have everything
the body needs.

729
01:06:19,072 --> 01:06:22,159
I understand you've run through
the agent training program.

730
01:06:23,201 --> 01:06:25,245
You know, I wrote that program.

731
01:06:25,537 --> 01:06:26,830
Here it comes.

732
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:29,041
- What did you think of her?
- Of who?

733
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:32,461
The woman in the red dress.
I designed her.

734
01:06:32,794 --> 01:06:35,547
She doesn't talk very much...

735
01:06:35,797 --> 01:06:39,760
...but if you'd like to meet her,
I can arrange a more personal milieu.

736
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:41,386
The digital pimp hard at work.

737
01:06:41,637 --> 01:06:43,889
Pay no attention to
these hypocrites, Neo.

738
01:06:45,182 --> 01:06:47,017
To deny our own impulses...

739
01:06:47,267 --> 01:06:50,395
...is to deny the very thing
that makes us human.

740
01:06:52,314 --> 01:06:53,690
Dozer, when you're done...

741
01:06:53,941 --> 01:06:55,359
...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.

742
01:06:56,068 --> 01:06:57,402
We're going in.

743
01:06:58,111 --> 01:06:59,529
I'm taking Neo to see her.

744
01:07:03,659 --> 01:07:04,701
See who?

745
01:07:05,702 --> 01:07:06,954
The Oracle.

746
01:07:12,459 --> 01:07:14,002
Everyone, please observe...

747
01:07:14,336 --> 01:07:17,047
...the "fasten seat belt"
and "no smoking" signs are on.

748
01:07:17,547 --> 01:07:20,926
Sit back and enjoy your flight.

749
01:07:45,242 --> 01:07:46,285
We're in.

750
01:08:02,009 --> 01:08:03,135
We'll be back in an hour.

751
01:08:17,941 --> 01:08:19,359
Unbelievable...

752
01:08:20,193 --> 01:08:21,528
...isn't it?

753
01:08:25,115 --> 01:08:26,950
- God!
- What?

754
01:08:27,618 --> 01:08:28,994
I used to eat there.

755
01:08:31,246 --> 01:08:32,873
Really good noodles.

756
01:08:37,669 --> 01:08:40,172
I have these memories from my life.

757
01:08:42,633 --> 01:08:44,301
None of them happened.

758
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:46,261
What does that mean?

759
01:08:46,511 --> 01:08:48,722
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.

760
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:50,849
But an oracle can?

761
01:08:51,308 --> 01:08:52,517
That's different.

762
01:08:57,272 --> 01:08:59,441
Did you go to her?

763
01:09:00,025 --> 01:09:01,193
Yes.

764
01:09:01,693 --> 01:09:03,070
What did she tell you?

765
01:09:06,323 --> 01:09:07,824
She told me...

766
01:09:08,867 --> 01:09:10,035
What?

767
01:09:13,830 --> 01:09:15,165
We're here.

768
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:17,834
Come with me.

769
01:09:37,813 --> 01:09:40,315
So is this the same oracle
that made...

770
01:09:40,482 --> 01:09:41,650
...the prophecy?

771
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:46,238
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.

772
01:09:46,697 --> 01:09:48,699
- The beginning?
- Of the Resistance.

773
01:09:50,951 --> 01:09:53,328
And she knows what? Everything?

774
01:09:55,372 --> 01:09:57,291
She would say she knows enough.

775
01:09:58,417 --> 01:10:00,210
And she's never wrong.

776
01:10:02,421 --> 01:10:05,591
Try not to think of it
in terms of right and wrong.

777
01:10:05,924 --> 01:10:07,509
She is a guide, Neo.

778
01:10:07,884 --> 01:10:09,761
She can help you to find the path.

779
01:10:10,345 --> 01:10:11,513
She helped you?

780
01:10:14,016 --> 01:10:15,350
What did she tell you?

781
01:10:17,811 --> 01:10:20,022
That I would find the One.

782
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:35,287
I told you I can only
show you the door.

783
01:10:35,996 --> 01:10:38,081
You have to walk through it.

784
01:10:41,877 --> 01:10:42,961
Hello, Neo.

785
01:10:43,211 --> 01:10:44,880
You're right on time.

786
01:10:52,804 --> 01:10:56,600
Make yourself at home, Morpheus.
Neo, come with me.

787
01:11:02,272 --> 01:11:03,857
These are the other Potentials.

788
01:11:04,107 --> 01:11:05,651
You can wait here.

789
01:11:46,483 --> 01:11:49,027
Do not try and bend the spoon.

790
01:11:49,403 --> 01:11:51,530
That's impossible.

791
01:11:52,364 --> 01:11:56,368
Instead, only try
to realize the truth.

792
01:11:56,910 --> 01:11:58,287
What truth?

793
01:11:58,537 --> 01:12:00,205
There is no spoon.

794
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:04,126
There is no spoon?

795
01:12:04,376 --> 01:12:08,880
Then you'll see that it is not the spoon
that bends. It is only yourself.

796
01:12:24,897 --> 01:12:26,398
The Oracle will you see now.

797
01:12:37,075 --> 01:12:38,619
I know you're Neo.

798
01:12:39,244 --> 01:12:40,412
Be right with you.

799
01:12:41,455 --> 01:12:43,832
- You're the Oracle?
- Bingo.

800
01:12:46,543 --> 01:12:49,421
Not quite what you
were expecting, right?

801
01:12:50,464 --> 01:12:52,633
Almost done.

802
01:12:55,135 --> 01:12:56,762
Smell good, don't they?

803
01:12:59,514 --> 01:13:01,350
I'd ask you to sit down...

804
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:03,977
...but you're not going to anyway.

805
01:13:04,478 --> 01:13:07,356
- And don't worry about the vase.
- What vase?

806
01:13:10,484 --> 01:13:11,652
That vase.

807
01:13:12,611 --> 01:13:13,654
I'm sorry.

808
01:13:13,904 --> 01:13:15,781
I said, don't worry about it.

809
01:13:16,949 --> 01:13:18,909
I'll get one of my kids to fix it.

810
01:13:19,534 --> 01:13:20,744
How did you know?

811
01:13:22,788 --> 01:13:26,583
What's really going to bake
your noodle later on is...

812
01:13:26,917 --> 01:13:29,878
...would you still have broken it
if I hadn't said anything?

813
01:13:34,675 --> 01:13:36,593
You're cuter than I thought.

814
01:13:39,638 --> 01:13:41,890
I can see why she likes you.

815
01:13:42,766 --> 01:13:43,850
Who?

816
01:13:44,101 --> 01:13:45,936
Not too bright, though.

817
01:13:49,231 --> 01:13:52,317
You know why Morpheus
brought you to see me.

818
01:13:54,444 --> 01:13:55,612
So...

819
01:13:56,572 --> 01:13:57,948
...what do you think?

820
01:13:59,783 --> 01:14:01,535
Do you think you are the One?

821
01:14:03,495 --> 01:14:04,538
I don't know.

822
01:14:07,958 --> 01:14:09,376
You know what that means?

823
01:14:10,210 --> 01:14:11,378
It's Latin.

824
01:14:11,753 --> 01:14:13,964
Means, "Know thyself."

825
01:14:15,424 --> 01:14:17,384
I'll let you in on a little secret.

826
01:14:19,636 --> 01:14:23,473
Being the One is just
like being in love.

827
01:14:24,182 --> 01:14:27,060
No one can tell you you're in love.
You just know it...

828
01:14:27,311 --> 01:14:28,437
...through and through.

829
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:30,814
Balls to bones.

830
01:14:33,358 --> 01:14:35,235
Well...

831
01:14:36,153 --> 01:14:38,238
...I'd better have a look at you.

832
01:14:39,573 --> 01:14:41,074
Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."

833
01:14:55,464 --> 01:14:57,132
Okay...

834
01:14:57,758 --> 01:15:02,721
Now I'm supposed to say,
"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."

835
01:15:03,221 --> 01:15:04,348
Then you say:

836
01:15:04,932 --> 01:15:06,224
But what?

837
01:15:06,475 --> 01:15:10,437
But you already know
what I'm going to tell you.

838
01:15:11,855 --> 01:15:14,816
- I'm not the One.
- Sorry, kid.

839
01:15:16,443 --> 01:15:18,445
You got the gift...

840
01:15:19,446 --> 01:15:21,657
...but it looks like
you're waiting for something.

841
01:15:26,536 --> 01:15:30,499
- What?
- Your next life, maybe. Who knows?

842
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:33,335
That's the way these things go.

843
01:15:34,211 --> 01:15:36,797
- What's funny?
- Morpheus.

844
01:15:40,259 --> 01:15:41,969
He almost had me convinced.

845
01:15:42,219 --> 01:15:43,345
I know.

846
01:15:44,888 --> 01:15:47,015
Poor Morpheus.

847
01:15:49,393 --> 01:15:52,521
Without him, we're lost.

848
01:15:54,064 --> 01:15:56,233
What do you mean, "without him"?

849
01:16:00,237 --> 01:16:02,155
Are you sure you want
to hear this?

850
01:16:04,366 --> 01:16:07,119
Morpheus believes in you, Neo.

851
01:16:08,829 --> 01:16:10,998
And no one, not you, not even me...

852
01:16:11,248 --> 01:16:13,500
...can convince him otherwise.

853
01:16:13,875 --> 01:16:16,253
He believes it so blindly...

854
01:16:16,545 --> 01:16:20,882
...that he's going to sacrifice
his life to save yours.

855
01:16:21,133 --> 01:16:25,095
- What?
- You're going to have to make a choice.

856
01:16:25,721 --> 01:16:29,308
In the one hand,
you'll have Morpheus' life.

857
01:16:29,808 --> 01:16:32,686
And in the other hand,
you'll have your own.

858
01:16:34,104 --> 01:16:36,398
One of you is going to die.

859
01:16:38,483 --> 01:16:41,778
Which one will be up to you.

860
01:16:43,155 --> 01:16:45,073
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.

861
01:16:45,324 --> 01:16:46,992
You have a good soul.

862
01:16:48,076 --> 01:16:50,787
And I hate giving
good people bad news.

863
01:16:53,916 --> 01:16:55,375
Don't worry about it.

864
01:16:55,626 --> 01:16:58,045
As soon as you
step outside that door...

865
01:16:58,295 --> 01:17:00,422
...you'll start feeling better.

866
01:17:01,131 --> 01:17:04,927
You'll remember you don't believe
in any of this fate crap.

867
01:17:05,761 --> 01:17:08,513
You're in control of your own life.

868
01:17:09,348 --> 01:17:10,641
Remember?

869
01:17:12,517 --> 01:17:14,186
Here...

870
01:17:15,395 --> 01:17:16,939
...take a cookie.

871
01:17:17,481 --> 01:17:20,817
I promise, by the time
you're done eating it...

872
01:17:21,777 --> 01:17:24,154
...you'll feel right as rain.

873
01:17:33,372 --> 01:17:34,706
What was said...

874
01:17:35,332 --> 01:17:36,792
...was for you...

875
01:17:37,334 --> 01:17:39,169
...and for you alone.

876
01:18:02,109 --> 01:18:03,235
They're on the way.

877
01:18:33,015 --> 01:18:34,057
What is that?

878
01:18:48,822 --> 01:18:50,240
Oh, deja vu.

879
01:18:53,744 --> 01:18:54,828
What did you just say?

880
01:18:55,078 --> 01:18:56,580
Nothing.
Just deja vu.

881
01:18:56,830 --> 01:18:58,457
- What did you see?
- What happened?

882
01:18:59,875 --> 01:19:02,044
A black cat went past us...

883
01:19:02,294 --> 01:19:03,921
...then another just like it.

884
01:19:04,171 --> 01:19:05,714
Was it the same cat?

885
01:19:06,673 --> 01:19:07,883
I'm not sure.

886
01:19:08,675 --> 01:19:10,469
Switch, Apoc.

887
01:19:13,764 --> 01:19:14,806
What is it?

888
01:19:15,057 --> 01:19:19,478
A deja vu is usually a glitch in the
Matrix when they change something.

889
01:19:22,648 --> 01:19:23,690
Oh, my God.

890
01:19:25,525 --> 01:19:27,611
Let's go.

891
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:33,492
They cut the hard line.
It's a trap! Get out!

892
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:40,249
Oh, no.

893
01:19:41,708 --> 01:19:42,751
Oh, no.

894
01:20:20,539 --> 01:20:23,000
That's what they changed.
We're trapped.

895
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:25,127
Be calm. Give me your phone.

896
01:20:25,377 --> 01:20:26,920
They'll be able to track it.

897
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:28,589
We have no choice.

898
01:20:30,007 --> 01:20:31,216
Operator.

899
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:34,386
<i>Find a structural drawing of</i>
<i>this building, Find it fast,</i>

900
01:20:42,227 --> 01:20:44,813
- Got it!
<i>- I need the main wet-wall,</i>

901
01:20:47,816 --> 01:20:48,901
Eighth floor.

902
01:20:49,109 --> 01:20:50,694
<i>They're on the eighth floor,</i>

903
01:20:50,986 --> 01:20:52,446
Switch, straight ahead.

904
01:21:00,495 --> 01:21:02,664
I hope the Oracle
gave you some good news.

905
01:21:10,923 --> 01:21:12,424
<i>Now left, That's it,</i>

906
01:21:12,716 --> 01:21:13,759
Good.

907
01:21:23,477 --> 01:21:24,770
Where are they?

908
01:22:25,205 --> 01:22:26,373
They're in the walls.

909
01:22:27,833 --> 01:22:29,001
In the walls!

910
01:22:50,397 --> 01:22:52,107
It's an agent!

911
01:23:01,033 --> 01:23:04,202
You must get Neo out!
He's all that matters!

912
01:23:04,494 --> 01:23:05,704
No, Morpheus! Don't!

913
01:23:05,954 --> 01:23:07,497
Trinity, go!

914
01:23:07,664 --> 01:23:09,041
Go!

915
01:23:15,255 --> 01:23:17,174
- We can't leave him!
- We have to!

916
01:23:42,449 --> 01:23:44,451
Come on!

917
01:23:48,205 --> 01:23:52,042
The great Morpheus.
We meet at last.

918
01:23:52,584 --> 01:23:53,710
And you are?

919
01:23:53,961 --> 01:23:55,712
A Smith.

920
01:23:55,963 --> 01:23:57,256
Agent Smith.

921
01:23:57,839 --> 01:23:59,883
You all look the same to me.

922
01:24:55,522 --> 01:24:56,815
Take him.

923
01:25:10,037 --> 01:25:11,872
- Operator.
<i>- I need an exit, fast,</i>

924
01:25:13,957 --> 01:25:16,877
There was an accident.
Goddamn car accident.

925
01:25:17,210 --> 01:25:19,004
<i>All of a sudden, boom,</i>

926
01:25:19,254 --> 01:25:20,631
Somebody up there still likes me.

927
01:25:20,881 --> 01:25:22,132
I got you.

928
01:25:22,633 --> 01:25:24,551
<i>Just get me out of here fast,</i>

929
01:25:24,801 --> 01:25:27,471
Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.
An old TV repair shop.

930
01:25:27,721 --> 01:25:28,764
Right.

931
01:25:31,892 --> 01:25:33,477
- Operator.
<i>- Tank, it's me,</i>

932
01:25:33,727 --> 01:25:34,895
Is Morpheus alive?

933
01:25:35,270 --> 01:25:36,563
Is Morpheus alive, Tank?

934
01:25:36,980 --> 01:25:38,899
<i>Yes, They're moving him,</i>
<i>I don't know where,</i>

935
01:25:39,107 --> 01:25:42,569
- He's alive. We need an exit.
- You're not far from Cypher.

936
01:25:42,819 --> 01:25:44,154
<i>- Cypher?</i>
- I know.

937
01:25:44,404 --> 01:25:46,490
<i>- I sent him to Franklin and Erie,</i>
- Got it.

938
01:25:55,582 --> 01:25:56,792
Got him.

939
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:08,762
Where are they?

940
01:26:09,012 --> 01:26:10,264
Making the call.

941
01:26:10,931 --> 01:26:12,099
Good.

942
01:26:25,654 --> 01:26:27,447
You first.

943
01:26:29,658 --> 01:26:30,909
Shit!

944
01:26:39,585 --> 01:26:41,753
I don't know. It just went dead.

945
01:27:08,572 --> 01:27:09,781
<i>Hello, Trinity,</i>

946
01:27:10,198 --> 01:27:11,533
Cypher? Where's Tank?

947
01:27:17,122 --> 01:27:18,165
You know...

948
01:27:19,875 --> 01:27:22,002
...for a long time...

949
01:27:23,211 --> 01:27:26,131
...I thought I was in love with you.

950
01:27:26,882 --> 01:27:28,926
<i>I used to dream about you,</i>

951
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:32,721
You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.

952
01:27:32,971 --> 01:27:35,349
<i>Too bad things had to</i>
<i>turn out this way,</i>

953
01:27:35,849 --> 01:27:36,934
You killed them.

954
01:27:37,434 --> 01:27:38,936
- What?
- Oh, God.

955
01:27:39,186 --> 01:27:40,604
I'm tired, Trinity.

956
01:27:42,022 --> 01:27:43,899
I'm tired of this war...

957
01:27:44,191 --> 01:27:47,027
...tired of fighting.
I'm tired of this ship...

958
01:27:47,361 --> 01:27:51,990
...of being cold, of eating
the same goddamn goop every day.

959
01:27:54,284 --> 01:27:55,327
But most of all...

960
01:27:55,911 --> 01:27:59,289
<i>,,, I'm tired of that jackoff</i>
<i>and all of his bullshit,</i>

961
01:28:00,415 --> 01:28:01,708
Surprise, asshole!

962
01:28:02,251 --> 01:28:04,461
I bet you never saw this coming...

963
01:28:04,711 --> 01:28:05,754
...did you?

964
01:28:08,048 --> 01:28:10,425
God, I wish I could be there...

965
01:28:11,009 --> 01:28:12,511
...when they break you.

966
01:28:13,553 --> 01:28:16,723
I wish I could walk in
just when it happens...

967
01:28:17,432 --> 01:28:19,142
...so right then...

968
01:28:19,393 --> 01:28:20,727
...you'd know it was me.

969
01:28:21,144 --> 01:28:24,106
- You gave them Morpheus.
<i>- He lied to us, Trinity,</i>

970
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:26,191
He tricked us!

971
01:28:26,733 --> 01:28:28,735
If you had told us the truth...

972
01:28:28,986 --> 01:28:31,863
...we would've told you to shove
that red pill up your ass!

973
01:28:32,114 --> 01:28:35,409
- That is not true, Cypher. He set us free.
<i>- "Free,"</i>

974
01:28:35,659 --> 01:28:37,369
You call this free?

975
01:28:39,788 --> 01:28:42,291
All I do is what he tells me to do.

976
01:28:43,875 --> 01:28:46,795
If I had to choose between
that and the Matrix...

977
01:28:47,963 --> 01:28:49,172
...I choose the Matrix.

978
01:28:49,423 --> 01:28:51,091
The Matrix isn't real.

979
01:28:51,341 --> 01:28:52,759
<i>I disagree, Trinity,</i>

980
01:28:53,010 --> 01:28:55,262
I think the Matrix...

981
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:58,181
...can be more real than this world.

982
01:29:00,350 --> 01:29:02,853
All I do is pull the plug here.

983
01:29:03,103 --> 01:29:04,438
But there...

984
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:07,274
<i>,,, you have to watch Apoc die,</i>

985
01:29:15,032 --> 01:29:16,742
<i>Welcome to the real world,</i>

986
01:29:16,909 --> 01:29:17,993
But you're out.

987
01:29:18,243 --> 01:29:20,662
<i>- You can't go back,</i>
- That's what you think.

988
01:29:20,913 --> 01:29:22,414
<i>They'll reinsert my body,</i>

989
01:29:22,664 --> 01:29:26,293
<i>I go back to sleep, When I wake up,</i>
<i>I won't remember a thing,</i>

990
01:29:26,543 --> 01:29:27,669
By the way...

991
01:29:27,836 --> 01:29:30,756
...if you have anything important
to say to Switch...

992
01:29:31,256 --> 01:29:33,467
<i>- ,,, say it now,</i>
- No, please don't.

993
01:29:34,009 --> 01:29:35,636
Not like this.

994
01:29:37,346 --> 01:29:38,972
Not like this.

995
01:29:43,435 --> 01:29:44,478
Too late.

996
01:29:44,937 --> 01:29:46,521
Goddamn you, Cypher!

997
01:29:46,772 --> 01:29:48,649
Don't hate me, Trinity.

998
01:29:49,024 --> 01:29:50,901
I'm just a messenger.

999
01:29:51,318 --> 01:29:54,488
And right now,
I'm going to prove it to you.

1000
01:29:55,572 --> 01:29:57,241
If Morpheus was right...

1001
01:29:57,783 --> 01:29:59,660
...there's no way
I can pull this plug.

1002
01:30:00,244 --> 01:30:01,745
<i>If Neo's the One,,,</i>

1003
01:30:02,246 --> 01:30:04,081
<i>,,, then there'd have to be,,,</i>

1004
01:30:04,331 --> 01:30:06,917
...some kind of a miracle to stop me.

1005
01:30:07,417 --> 01:30:08,752
Right?

1006
01:30:08,919 --> 01:30:12,256
I mean, how can he be the One
if he's dead?

1007
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:15,884
<i>You never did answer me before,,,</i>

1008
01:30:16,176 --> 01:30:18,512
<i>,,, if you bought into</i>
<i>Morpheus' bullshit,</i>

1009
01:30:18,887 --> 01:30:22,099
Come on. All I want
is a little yes or no.

1010
01:30:23,475 --> 01:30:25,811
Look into his eyes...

1011
01:30:26,562 --> 01:30:28,063
<i>,,, those big, pretty eyes,,,</i>

1012
01:30:30,816 --> 01:30:32,150
...and tell me...

1013
01:30:32,859 --> 01:30:34,152
<i>,,, yes,,,</i>

1014
01:30:34,444 --> 01:30:35,821
<i>,,, or no,</i>

1015
01:30:37,114 --> 01:30:38,240
Yes.

1016
01:30:38,865 --> 01:30:39,992
I don't believe it.

1017
01:30:41,410 --> 01:30:46,164
Believe it or not, you piece of shit,
you're still going to burn!

1018
01:31:04,558 --> 01:31:05,809
You first.

1019
01:31:13,859 --> 01:31:14,902
You're hurt.

1020
01:31:15,235 --> 01:31:16,320
I'll be all right.

1021
01:31:19,114 --> 01:31:20,282
Dozer?

1022
01:31:38,550 --> 01:31:40,928
Have you ever stood and stared at it?

1023
01:31:41,803 --> 01:31:44,932
Marveled at its beauty...

1024
01:31:45,307 --> 01:31:47,559
...its genius?

1025
01:31:48,727 --> 01:31:50,604
Billions of people...

1026
01:31:50,854 --> 01:31:53,607
...just living out their lives.

1027
01:31:54,650 --> 01:31:56,318
Oblivious.

1028
01:32:00,906 --> 01:32:03,784
Did you know that the first Matrix...

1029
01:32:04,034 --> 01:32:08,747
...was designed to be a perfect
human world where none suffered...

1030
01:32:09,206 --> 01:32:12,125
...where everyone would be happy.

1031
01:32:12,668 --> 01:32:14,169
It was a disaster.

1032
01:32:14,419 --> 01:32:18,757
No one would accept the program.
Entire crops were lost.

1033
01:32:19,633 --> 01:32:21,385
Some believe that...

1034
01:32:21,635 --> 01:32:26,014
...we lacked the programming language
to describe your perfect world.

1035
01:32:26,265 --> 01:32:29,142
But I believe that, as a species...

1036
01:32:29,393 --> 01:32:33,230
...human beings define
their reality through misery...

1037
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:34,856
...and suffering.

1038
01:32:35,107 --> 01:32:37,818
So the perfect world was a dream...

1039
01:32:38,068 --> 01:32:42,906
...that your primitive cerebrum
kept trying to wake up from.

1040
01:32:44,241 --> 01:32:47,911
Which is why the Matrix was
redesigned to this.

1041
01:32:48,370 --> 01:32:49,871
The peak...

1042
01:32:50,122 --> 01:32:51,540
...of your civilization.

1043
01:32:51,790 --> 01:32:54,042
I say, "your civilization"...

1044
01:32:54,293 --> 01:32:58,422
...because when we started thinking
for you, it became our civilization...

1045
01:32:58,672 --> 01:33:01,758
...which is, of course,
what this is all about.

1046
01:33:03,093 --> 01:33:05,679
Evolution, Morpheus.

1047
01:33:05,971 --> 01:33:07,306
Evolution.

1048
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,476
Like the dinosaur.

1049
01:33:13,645 --> 01:33:15,272
Look out that window.

1050
01:33:15,981 --> 01:33:18,108
You had your time.

1051
01:33:18,817 --> 01:33:22,738
The future is our world, Morpheus.

1052
01:33:23,071 --> 01:33:25,449
The future is our time.

1053
01:33:29,703 --> 01:33:30,996
There could be a problem.

1054
01:33:31,788 --> 01:33:35,167
- What are they doing to him?
- They're breaking into his mind.

1055
01:33:35,417 --> 01:33:37,586
It's like hacking a computer.
All it takes is time.

1056
01:33:37,836 --> 01:33:39,046
How much time?

1057
01:33:39,296 --> 01:33:42,424
Depends on the mind.
But eventually, it'll crack...

1058
01:33:42,674 --> 01:33:47,095
...and his alpha patterns
will change from this to this.

1059
01:33:47,346 --> 01:33:50,307
When it does, he'll tell them
anything they want to know.

1060
01:33:50,557 --> 01:33:51,600
What do they want?

1061
01:33:51,850 --> 01:33:55,896
The leader of every ship is given codes
to Zion's mainframe computer.

1062
01:33:56,146 --> 01:33:59,066
If an agent got the codes
and got into Zion's mainframe...

1063
01:33:59,316 --> 01:34:02,402
...they could destroy us.
We can't let that happen.

1064
01:34:03,237 --> 01:34:04,863
Zion's more important than me...

1065
01:34:05,030 --> 01:34:06,240
...or you...

1066
01:34:06,406 --> 01:34:07,616
...or even Morpheus.

1067
01:34:11,411 --> 01:34:13,080
There has to be
something we can do.

1068
01:34:13,497 --> 01:34:15,499
There is. We pull the plug.

1069
01:34:18,585 --> 01:34:20,337
You're going to kill him?

1070
01:34:20,587 --> 01:34:21,755
Kill Morpheus?

1071
01:34:22,381 --> 01:34:24,007
We don't have a choice.

1072
01:34:30,806 --> 01:34:33,725
Never send a human
to do a machine's job.

1073
01:34:33,976 --> 01:34:35,727
If the insider has failed...

1074
01:34:35,978 --> 01:34:39,189
...they'll sever the connection
as soon as possible, unless...

1075
01:34:39,439 --> 01:34:41,149
They're dead. In either case...

1076
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:44,945
We have no choice. Continue as planned.
Deploy the sentinels.

1077
01:34:45,195 --> 01:34:46,280
Immediately.

1078
01:34:51,535 --> 01:34:54,204
Morpheus, you were more
than a leader to us.

1079
01:34:55,163 --> 01:34:57,374
You were a father.

1080
01:34:58,917 --> 01:35:00,877
We'll miss you always.

1081
01:35:07,634 --> 01:35:08,969
Stop!

1082
01:35:10,178 --> 01:35:11,388
I don't believe this is happening.

1083
01:35:11,638 --> 01:35:13,682
- Neo, this has to be done.
- Does it?

1084
01:35:14,474 --> 01:35:15,851
I don't know.

1085
01:35:16,184 --> 01:35:17,728
This can't be just coincidence.

1086
01:35:17,936 --> 01:35:20,105
- What are you talking about?
- The Oracle.

1087
01:35:20,355 --> 01:35:22,149
She told me this would happen.

1088
01:35:22,566 --> 01:35:26,737
She told me that I would
have to make a choice.

1089
01:35:27,195 --> 01:35:28,447
What choice?

1090
01:35:31,408 --> 01:35:33,911
- What are you doing?
- I'm going in.

1091
01:35:34,244 --> 01:35:36,580
- No, you're not.
- I have to.

1092
01:35:36,788 --> 01:35:40,417
Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself
so that we could get you out.

1093
01:35:40,667 --> 01:35:42,586
There is no way
that you're going back in.

1094
01:35:43,170 --> 01:35:46,423
Morpheus did what he did because
he believed I'm something I'm not.

1095
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:51,303
- What?
- I'm not the One, Trinity.

1096
01:35:51,678 --> 01:35:54,640
- The Oracle hit me with that too.
- No, you have to be.

1097
01:35:54,890 --> 01:35:57,559
I'm sorry, I'm not.
I'm just another guy.

1098
01:35:58,227 --> 01:35:59,478
No, Neo, that's not true.

1099
01:36:00,062 --> 01:36:01,396
It can't be true.

1100
01:36:01,730 --> 01:36:03,857
Why?

1101
01:36:07,110 --> 01:36:10,447
This is loco. They've got Morpheus
in a military-controlled building.

1102
01:36:10,697 --> 01:36:15,077
Even if you somehow got inside, those
are agents holding him. Three of them.

1103
01:36:16,370 --> 01:36:20,290
I want Morpheus back too, but
what you're talking about is suicide.

1104
01:36:20,540 --> 01:36:23,335
That's what it looks like,
but it's not.

1105
01:36:23,585 --> 01:36:25,963
I can't explain to you why it's not.

1106
01:36:27,047 --> 01:36:30,759
Morpheus believed something, and
he was ready to give his life for it.

1107
01:36:31,009 --> 01:36:34,012
I understand that now.
That's why I have to go.

1108
01:36:34,263 --> 01:36:36,807
- Why?
- Because I believe in something.

1109
01:36:37,015 --> 01:36:38,767
What?

1110
01:36:39,309 --> 01:36:41,019
I believe I can bring him back.

1111
01:36:57,995 --> 01:36:59,913
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

1112
01:37:00,205 --> 01:37:03,208
- No, you're not.
- "No"?

1113
01:37:03,375 --> 01:37:05,502
Let me tell you what I believe.

1114
01:37:06,003 --> 01:37:08,380
Morpheus means more to me
than he does to you.

1115
01:37:08,714 --> 01:37:13,010
I believe if you are serious about
saving him, you will need my help.

1116
01:37:13,260 --> 01:37:15,304
And since I am the ranking officer...

1117
01:37:15,554 --> 01:37:18,432
...if you don't like it,
I believe you can go to hell.

1118
01:37:19,182 --> 01:37:21,602
Because you aren't going anywhere else.

1119
01:37:22,019 --> 01:37:23,562
Tank...

1120
01:37:23,729 --> 01:37:24,897
...load us up.

1121
01:37:34,489 --> 01:37:37,784
I'd like to share
a revelation that I've had...

1122
01:37:38,201 --> 01:37:39,745
...during my time here.

1123
01:37:39,995 --> 01:37:43,999
It came to me when I tried
to classify your species...

1124
01:37:44,249 --> 01:37:46,501
...and I realized...

1125
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:49,046
...that you're not actually mammals.

1126
01:37:51,256 --> 01:37:53,717
Every mammal on this planet...

1127
01:37:54,051 --> 01:37:58,972
...instinctively develops an equilibrium
with the surrounding environment.

1128
01:37:59,223 --> 01:38:01,058
But you humans do not.

1129
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:05,145
You move to an area
and you multiply...

1130
01:38:05,395 --> 01:38:09,900
...and multiply until every
natural resource is consumed.

1131
01:38:10,234 --> 01:38:12,319
The only way you can survive...

1132
01:38:12,611 --> 01:38:15,572
...is to spread to another area.

1133
01:38:20,994 --> 01:38:23,872
There is another organism
on this planet...

1134
01:38:24,122 --> 01:38:26,083
...that follows the same pattern.

1135
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:28,377
Do you know what it is?

1136
01:38:28,752 --> 01:38:30,587
A virus.

1137
01:38:31,922 --> 01:38:34,967
Human beings are a disease.

1138
01:38:35,342 --> 01:38:36,885
A cancer of this planet.

1139
01:38:37,135 --> 01:38:39,263
You are a plague.

1140
01:38:39,805 --> 01:38:42,766
And we are the cure.

1141
01:38:43,767 --> 01:38:45,185
Okay, so what do you need?

1142
01:38:45,811 --> 01:38:46,937
Besides a miracle.

1143
01:38:47,521 --> 01:38:48,730
Guns.

1144
01:38:49,439 --> 01:38:50,774
Lots of guns.

1145
01:39:03,620 --> 01:39:06,164
No one has ever done
anything like this.

1146
01:39:07,374 --> 01:39:09,293
That's why it's going to work.

1147
01:39:13,380 --> 01:39:15,340
Why isn't the serum working?

1148
01:39:15,924 --> 01:39:18,218
Perhaps we're asking
the wrong questions.

1149
01:39:20,304 --> 01:39:21,555
Leave me with him.

1150
01:39:24,141 --> 01:39:25,267
Now.

1151
01:39:36,486 --> 01:39:38,071
Hold on, Morpheus.

1152
01:39:38,322 --> 01:39:41,033
They're coming for you.
They're coming.

1153
01:39:43,410 --> 01:39:45,537
Can you hear me, Morpheus?

1154
01:39:45,787 --> 01:39:48,457
I'm going to be honest...

1155
01:39:48,832 --> 01:39:50,042
...with you.

1156
01:39:54,421 --> 01:39:55,839
I...

1157
01:39:56,590 --> 01:39:57,841
...hate...

1158
01:39:58,091 --> 01:40:00,052
...this place...

1159
01:40:00,385 --> 01:40:02,679
...this zoo...

1160
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:04,056
...this prison...

1161
01:40:04,306 --> 01:40:07,476
...this reality,
whatever you want to call it.

1162
01:40:07,726 --> 01:40:10,020
I can't stand it any longer.

1163
01:40:10,771 --> 01:40:12,648
It's the smell.

1164
01:40:14,024 --> 01:40:15,901
If there is such a thing.

1165
01:40:16,235 --> 01:40:19,529
I feel saturated by it.

1166
01:40:21,031 --> 01:40:23,450
I can taste...

1167
01:40:24,284 --> 01:40:26,328
...your stink.

1168
01:40:26,578 --> 01:40:30,332
And every time I do, I fear that
I have somehow been infected by it.

1169
01:40:30,582 --> 01:40:32,209
It's repulsive.

1170
01:40:32,376 --> 01:40:33,752
Isn't it?

1171
01:40:35,921 --> 01:40:38,215
I must get out of here.

1172
01:40:38,632 --> 01:40:40,842
I must get free.

1173
01:40:41,093 --> 01:40:43,971
And in this mind is the key.

1174
01:40:44,221 --> 01:40:45,889
My key.

1175
01:40:46,139 --> 01:40:49,017
Once Zion is destroyed,
there is no need for me to be here.

1176
01:40:49,268 --> 01:40:50,894
Do you understand?

1177
01:40:51,186 --> 01:40:52,563
I need the codes.

1178
01:40:52,813 --> 01:40:55,148
I have to get inside Zion...

1179
01:40:55,482 --> 01:40:57,985
...and you have to tell me how.

1180
01:40:58,402 --> 01:41:00,279
You're going to tell me...

1181
01:41:00,529 --> 01:41:02,698
...or you're going to die.

1182
01:41:22,885 --> 01:41:26,930
Please remove any metallic items
you're carrying. Keys, loose change.

1183
01:41:29,933 --> 01:41:30,976
Holy shit!

1184
01:41:43,071 --> 01:41:45,782
Backup. Send backup.

1185
01:42:09,556 --> 01:42:10,724
Freeze!

1186
01:44:25,776 --> 01:44:27,903
What were you doing?

1187
01:44:28,612 --> 01:44:29,905
He doesn't know.

1188
01:44:30,155 --> 01:44:31,657
Know what?

1189
01:44:59,726 --> 01:45:02,229
I think they're trying to save him.

1190
01:45:17,077 --> 01:45:18,829
There is no spoon.

1191
01:45:48,442 --> 01:45:50,611
Find them and destroy them!

1192
01:45:52,237 --> 01:45:54,114
I repeat. We're under attack!

1193
01:46:27,898 --> 01:46:28,941
Help!

1194
01:46:50,963 --> 01:46:52,172
Only human.

1195
01:46:53,257 --> 01:46:55,133
Dodge this.

1196
01:47:07,437 --> 01:47:08,981
- How did you do that?
- Do what?

1197
01:47:09,356 --> 01:47:13,277
You moved like they do.
I've never seen anyone move that fast.

1198
01:47:14,403 --> 01:47:15,779
It wasn't fast enough.

1199
01:47:18,532 --> 01:47:19,825
Can you fly that thing?

1200
01:47:21,159 --> 01:47:22,953
Not yet.

1201
01:47:25,163 --> 01:47:26,290
Operator.

1202
01:47:26,498 --> 01:47:29,668
<i>I need a pilot program</i>
<i>for a B-212 helicopter,</i>

1203
01:47:30,127 --> 01:47:31,420
<i>Hurry,</i>

1204
01:47:39,344 --> 01:47:40,971
Let's go.

1205
01:47:56,069 --> 01:47:57,154
No.

1206
01:48:48,747 --> 01:48:51,375
Morpheus, get up.
Get up, get up.

1207
01:49:29,413 --> 01:49:31,164
He's not going to make it.

1208
01:49:40,257 --> 01:49:41,300
Got you.

1209
01:51:30,200 --> 01:51:31,618
I knew it.

1210
01:51:32,119 --> 01:51:33,453
He's the One.

1211
01:51:49,428 --> 01:51:51,638
Do you believe it now, Trinity?

1212
01:51:57,561 --> 01:51:59,521
The Oracle.

1213
01:51:59,688 --> 01:52:02,065
- She told me...
- She told you...

1214
01:52:02,441 --> 01:52:04,026
...what you needed to hear.

1215
01:52:04,318 --> 01:52:05,652
That's all.

1216
01:52:06,695 --> 01:52:09,656
Sooner or later you'll realize,
just as I did...

1217
01:52:09,990 --> 01:52:12,284
...there's a difference
between knowing the path...

1218
01:52:13,035 --> 01:52:14,328
...and walking the path.

1219
01:52:17,372 --> 01:52:18,582
Operator.

1220
01:52:19,499 --> 01:52:22,044
- It's good to hear your voice.
<i>- We need an exit,</i>

1221
01:52:22,294 --> 01:52:25,088
Got one ready. Subway station,
State and Balboa.

1222
01:52:37,517 --> 01:52:39,102
Damn it!

1223
01:52:39,353 --> 01:52:40,562
The trace was completed.

1224
01:52:40,812 --> 01:52:44,399
- We have their position.
- Sentinels are standing by.

1225
01:52:46,109 --> 01:52:47,611
Order the strike.

1226
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:56,203
They're not out yet.

1227
01:53:07,339 --> 01:53:08,674
You first, Morpheus.

1228
01:53:29,361 --> 01:53:31,655
Neo, I want to tell you something...

1229
01:53:34,908 --> 01:53:38,870
...but I'm afraid of
what it could mean if I do.

1230
01:53:42,457 --> 01:53:45,752
Everything the Oracle
told me has come true.

1231
01:53:48,505 --> 01:53:50,048
Everything but this.

1232
01:53:51,466 --> 01:53:52,593
But what?

1233
01:54:18,911 --> 01:54:20,537
- What happened?
- An agent.

1234
01:54:20,787 --> 01:54:22,748
- Send me back.
- I can't.

1235
01:54:24,750 --> 01:54:26,752
Mr. Anderson.

1236
01:54:28,921 --> 01:54:30,297
Run, Neo. Run.

1237
01:54:35,594 --> 01:54:37,221
What is he doing?

1238
01:54:37,471 --> 01:54:38,722
He's beginning to believe.

1239
01:55:05,707 --> 01:55:07,084
You're empty.

1240
01:55:07,668 --> 01:55:08,961
So are you.

1241
01:55:42,119 --> 01:55:45,122
I'm going to enjoy watching you die...

1242
01:55:46,248 --> 01:55:47,291
...Mr. Anderson.

1243
01:56:28,248 --> 01:56:30,334
Jesus, he's killing him.

1244
01:57:56,503 --> 01:57:58,630
You hear that, Mr. Anderson?

1245
01:57:59,381 --> 01:58:02,384
That is the sound of inevitability.

1246
01:58:04,970 --> 01:58:08,307
It is the sound of your death.

1247
01:58:09,224 --> 01:58:11,560
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1248
01:58:11,810 --> 01:58:13,437
My name...

1249
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:18,483
...is Neo.

1250
01:58:50,724 --> 01:58:52,851
- What happened?
- I don't know. I lost him.

1251
01:58:55,437 --> 01:58:56,480
Oh, shit.

1252
01:59:08,867 --> 01:59:10,327
Sentinels.

1253
01:59:11,078 --> 01:59:13,330
- How long?
- Five, maybe six minutes.

1254
01:59:15,374 --> 01:59:17,543
Tank, charge the EMP.

1255
01:59:17,793 --> 01:59:20,837
- We can't use that until he's out.
- I know. Don't worry.

1256
01:59:21,922 --> 01:59:23,090
He's gonna make it.

1257
01:59:23,340 --> 01:59:25,217
Flat or pumps? No, just...

1258
01:59:25,467 --> 01:59:28,345
What the shit? That's my phone!

1259
01:59:28,762 --> 01:59:30,347
That guy took my phone!

1260
01:59:32,724 --> 01:59:36,103
- Got him! He's on the run.
<i>- Mr, Wizard,,,</i>

1261
01:59:36,562 --> 01:59:37,938
...get me out of here!

1262
01:59:38,188 --> 01:59:40,065
<i>I got an old exit,</i>
<i>Wabash and Lake,</i>

1263
01:59:44,111 --> 01:59:45,779
Oh, shit!

1264
02:00:06,592 --> 02:00:08,594
Help! Need a little help!

1265
02:00:10,220 --> 02:00:11,430
<i>The door,</i>

1266
02:00:27,404 --> 02:00:28,906
<i>The door on your left,</i>

1267
02:00:29,823 --> 02:00:31,074
<i>Your other left!</i>

1268
02:00:37,789 --> 02:00:39,041
<i>The back door,</i>

1269
02:00:59,811 --> 02:01:00,938
Oh, no.

1270
02:01:02,606 --> 02:01:04,107
Here they come.

1271
02:01:32,886 --> 02:01:34,137
He's going to make it.

1272
02:01:44,356 --> 02:01:47,484
<i>The fire escape at the end</i>
<i>of the alley, room 303,</i>

1273
02:02:22,394 --> 02:02:23,687
They're inside.

1274
02:02:25,939 --> 02:02:27,065
Hurry, Neo.

1275
02:03:23,121 --> 02:03:24,414
It can't be.

1276
02:03:32,214 --> 02:03:33,590
Check him.

1277
02:03:37,594 --> 02:03:39,137
He's gone.

1278
02:03:45,852 --> 02:03:48,272
Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

1279
02:03:58,365 --> 02:04:00,325
I'm not afraid anymore.

1280
02:04:01,952 --> 02:04:03,203
The Oracle told me...

1281
02:04:03,370 --> 02:04:08,876
...that I'd fall in love with that man.
The man that I love would be the One.

1282
02:04:12,004 --> 02:04:13,964
So you see...

1283
02:04:14,673 --> 02:04:16,675
...you can't be dead.

1284
02:04:18,260 --> 02:04:20,095
You can't be...

1285
02:04:21,638 --> 02:04:23,807
...because I love you.

1286
02:04:25,642 --> 02:04:27,352
You hear me?

1287
02:04:28,478 --> 02:04:30,147
I love you.

1288
02:04:54,087 --> 02:04:55,172
Now, get up.

1289
02:05:03,931 --> 02:05:05,015
No.

1290
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:32,793
How?

1291
02:05:33,669 --> 02:05:34,711
He is the One.

1292
02:07:59,189 --> 02:08:00,899
<i>I know you're out there,</i>

1293
02:08:01,149 --> 02:08:02,985
<i>I can feel you now,</i>

1294
02:08:03,402 --> 02:08:05,195
<i>I know that you're afraid,</i>

1295
02:08:05,445 --> 02:08:07,030
<i>You're afraid of us,</i>

1296
02:08:07,364 --> 02:08:09,199
<i>You're afraid of change,</i>

1297
02:08:10,409 --> 02:08:11,910
<i>I don't know the future,</i>

1298
02:08:12,160 --> 02:08:14,746
<i>I didn't come here to tell you</i>
<i>how this is going to end,</i>

1299
02:08:14,997 --> 02:08:17,958
<i>I came here to tell you</i>
<i>how it's going to begin,</i>

1300
02:08:18,917 --> 02:08:20,502
<i>I'll hang up this phone,</i>

1301
02:08:20,752 --> 02:08:23,839
<i>And then I'll show these people</i>
<i>what you don't want them to see,</i>

1302
02:08:24,089 --> 02:08:25,966
<i>I'm going to show them a world,,,</i>

1303
02:08:26,216 --> 02:08:27,968
<i>,,, without you,</i>

1304
02:08:28,260 --> 02:08:31,889
<i>A world without rules and controls,</i>
<i>without borders or boundaries,</i>

1305
02:08:32,139 --> 02:08:35,851
<i>A world where anything is possible,</i>

1306
02:08:38,478 --> 02:08:39,813
<i>Where we go from there,,,</i>

1307
02:08:40,063 --> 02:08:42,024
<i>,,, is a choice I leave to you,</i>
