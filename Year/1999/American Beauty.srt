1
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,868
<i>I need a father who's a role model,
not some horny geek boy...</i>

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,431
<i>who's going to spray his shorts
whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school.</i>

3
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,269
<i>What a lame-o.</i>

4
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:47,359
<i>Someone really should just put him
out of his misery.</i>

5
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,632
<i>You want me to kill him for you?</i>

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,749
<i>Yeah. Would you?</i>

7
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,912
<i>My name is Lester Burnham.</i>

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,037
<i>This is my neighborhood.</i>

9
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,918
<i>This is my street.</i>

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,719
<i>This is my life.</i>

11
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,590
<i>I'm 42 years old.
In less than a year, I'll be dead.</i>

12
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,517
<i>Of course, I don't know that yet.</i>

13
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,798
<i>And in a way, I'm dead already.</i>

14
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,550
<i>Look at me:
jerking off in the shower.</i>

15
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,154
<i>This will be the high point of my day.
It's all downhill from here.</i>

16
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,472
<i>That's my wife, Carolyn.</i>

17
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,350
<i>See the way the handle on those pruning shears
matches her gardening clogs?</i>

18
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,352
<i>That's not an accident.</i>

19
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,874
<i>Hush, Bitsy!</i>

20
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,669
- Hush. What is wrong with you?
- <i>That's our next-door neighbor, Jim.</i>

21
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,914
<i>And that's his lover, Jim.</i>

22
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,910
- You spoil her. Bitsy, no bark. Come inside now.
- Me?

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,833
- <i>Come on. Yes. Inside.</i>
- <i>Good morning, Jim!</i>

24
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,990
Good morning, Carolyn.

25
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,119
I love your tie! That color!

26
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,512
I just love your roses.
How do you get them to flourish like this?

27
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,149
Well, I'll tell you:
eggshells and Miracle-Gro.

28
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,552
- I've never heard that.
- <i>Man, I get exhausted just watching her.</i>

29
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,553
<i>She wasn't always like this.
She used to be happy.</i>

30
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,111
We <i>used to be happy.</i>

31
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,193
<i>My daughter Jane. Only child.</i>

32
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,117
<i>Janie's a pretty typical teenager:</i>

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,873
<i>angry, insecure, confused.</i>

34
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,954
<i>I wish I could tell her that's all going to pass,
but I don't want to lie to her.</i>

35
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,752
Jane, honey, are you trying
to look unattractive?

36
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,833
- Yes.
- Congratulations. You've succeeded admirably.

37
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,198
Lester, could you make me a little later, please,
because I'm not quite late enough.

38
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,629
Nice going, Dad.

39
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,793
<i>Both my wife and daughter
think I'm this gigantic loser.</i>

40
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,713
<i>And they're right.</i>

41
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,031
<i>I have lost something.</i>

42
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,078
<i>I'm not exactly sure what it is,</i>

43
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,550
<i>but I know I didn't always feel this...</i>

44
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,471
<i>sedated.</i>

45
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,154
<i>But you know what?</i>

46
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,552
<i>It's never too late to get it back.</i>

47
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,797
<i>Hello. This is Lester Burnham
from</i> Media Monthly <i>magazine.</i>

48
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,792
<i>I'm calling for Mr. Tamblin, please.

49
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,316
Well, we're all under a deadline here.
You see, there's some basic information...

50
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,632
about your product launch that isn't
even covered in your press release, and I'd...

51
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,473
Yeah, c... can I ask you a question?

52
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,838
Who is Tamblin? Does he exist?
'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in.

53
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,593
Yeah. Okay. I'll leave my number.

54
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,912
<i>It's 555-0199.</i>

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,390
Lester Burnham. Thank you!

56
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,713
Hey, Les. You got a minute?

57
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,349
For you, Brad, I got five!

58
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,718
So, yeah, I'm sure you can understand
our need to cut corners around here.

59
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,836
Oh, sure. Times are tight.

60
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,151
You got to free up some cash.
You got to spend money to make money.

61
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,993
- <i>Right?</i>
- Exactly.

62
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,834
<i>Like the time that Mr. Flournoy used
the company MasterCard to pay for that hooker,</i>

63
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,879
and she used the card numbers and stayed
at the St. Regis for, what was it, three months?

64
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,839
- That's unsubstantiated gossip.
- That's $50,000. That's somebody's salary.

65
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,878
That's somebody who's going to get fired
because Craig has to pay women to fuck him!

66
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,871
<i>Jesus!</i>

67
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,475
I mean, calm down.
Nobody's getting fired yet.

68
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,915
<i>That's why we're having everyone...</i>

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,312
write out a job description mapping
out in detail how they contribute.

70
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,995
That way management
can assess who's valuable...

71
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,674
And who's expendable.

72
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,320
<i>It's just business.</i>

73
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,517
I've been writing for this magazine for 14 years.

74
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,673
- You've been here how long? A whole month?
- I'm one of the good guys, Les.

75
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,479
I'm trying to level with you.

76
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,916
This is your one chance to save your job.

77
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,034
<i>There is no decision.
You just write the damn thing.</i>

78
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,998
- You don't think it's weird and kind of fascist?
- Possibly.

79
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,957
- But you don't want to be unemployed.
- All right.

80
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,634
Let's just all sell our souls and work for Satan
'cause it's more convenient that way.

81
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,632
Oh, could you be a little bit
more dramatic, please, huh?

82
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,836
So, we finally got new neighbors.

83
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,311
<i>You know, if the Lomans had let me represent them
instead of the Real Estate King,</i>

84
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,789
that house would never have sat
on the market for six months.

85
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,519
Well, they were still mad at you
for cutting down their sycamore.

86
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,068
<i>Their</i> sycamore? Come on.

87
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,754
A substantial portion of the root structure
was on our property.

88
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,673
You know that.
How can you call it <i>their</i> sycamore?

89
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,629
I wouldn't have the heart to just cut down something
if it wasn't partially mine, which, of course, it was.

90
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,679
<i>Bali Ha'i</i>

91
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,399
<i>They call you</i>

92
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,270
Mom, do we always have to listen
to this elevator music?

93
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,910
No. No, we don't.

94
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,754
And as soon you've prepared a nutritious
yet savory meal that I'm about to eat,

95
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,673
you can listen to whatever you like.

96
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,309
So, Janie, how was school?

97
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,675
It was okay.

98
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,069
Just okay?

99
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,073
No, Dad. It was spectacular.

100
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,718
Well, you want to know
how things went in my job today?

101
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,109
They've hired this efficiency expert,

102
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,794
this really friendly guy named Brad...

103
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,112
How perfect is that? And he's basically there
to make it seem they're justified...

104
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,510
in firing somebody, because they couldn't
just come out and say that, could they?

105
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,751
No, no. That would just be too honest.
So they've asked us...

106
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,196
You couldn't possibly care less, could you?

107
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,316
What do you expect?

108
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,473
You can't all of a sudden be my best friend
just because you had a bad day.

109
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,073
I mean, hello, you've barely
even spoken to me for months.

110
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,796
Oh, what? You're "Mother of the Year"?

111
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,190
- You treat her like an employee.
- What?

112
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,713
What?

113
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,360
I'm going to get some ice cream.

114
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,557
Janie...

115
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,430
I'm sorry I haven't been more available.

116
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,670
I'm just... I...

117
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,634
You know, you don't always
have to wait for me to come to you.

118
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,632
Oh, great. So now it's my fault?

119
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,996
I didn't say that.
It's nobody's fault. It...

120
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,277
Janie, what happened?
We used to be pals.

121
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,992
I will sell this house today.

122
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,755
I will sell this house today.
I will sell this house today.

123
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,998
I will sell this house today.

124
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,433
Welcome. I'm Carolyn Burnham.

125
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,432
This living room is very dramatic.

126
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,273
<i>Wait till you see
the native stone fireplace!</i>

127
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,639
A simple cream could really lighten things up.
You could even put in a skylight.

128
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,316
Well, why don't we go into the kitchen?

129
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,631
It's a dream come true for any cook.

130
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,917
Just filled with positive energy, huh?

131
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,279
And you'll be surprised how much a ceiling fan
can cut down on your energy costs.

132
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,557
<i>You know, you could have some really fun
backyard get-togethers out here.</i>

133
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,871
The ad said this pool was lagoon-like.
There's nothing lagoon-like about it.

134
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:49,238
Except for maybe the bugs.
There aren't even any plants out here.

135
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,118
What do you call this?
Is this not a plant?

136
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,476
If you have a problem with the plants,
I can always call my landscape architect.

137
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,951
- Solved.
- I mean, I think "lagoon," I think waterfall, tropical.

138
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,873
This is a cement hole.

139
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,791
Uh...

140
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,872
I have some tiki torches in the garage.

141
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,715
Shut up! Stop it! You weak... You baby!

142
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,633
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

143
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,956
Who are you looking for?

144
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,554
My parents are coming tonight.

145
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,155
They're trying to, you know,
take an active interest in me.

146
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,073
Gross. I hate it when my mom does that.

147
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,994
They're such assholes.
Why can't they just have their own lives?

148
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:50,799
What makes you sure she wants us to be there?
Did she ask us to come?

149
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,111
Of course not. She doesn't want us to know
how important this is to her.

150
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,236
But she's been practicing for weeks.

151
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,438
I'll bet she's going to resent it,
and I'm missing the James Bond marathon on T.N.T.

152
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,355
Lester, this is important. I'm sensing
a real distance growing between you and Jane.

153
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,113
"Growing"? She hates me.

154
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,034
- She's just willful.
- She hates you too.

155
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,598
- Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry.
- Pardon me.

156
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,035
Hi! Patty!

157
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,953
<i>Now, for your halftime entertainment,</i>

158
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,192
<i>Rockwell High's award-winning
Dancing Spartanettes!</i>

159
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,794
We can leave right after this, right?

160
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,348
Shit. They're still here.

161
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,431
Janie!

162
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,636
Hey, I really enjoyed that.

163
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,553
- Congratulations, honey. You were great.
- <i>I didn't win anything.</i>

164
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,155
- Hi. I'm Lester, Janie's dad.
- Oh, hi.

165
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,194
This is my friend, Angela Hayes.

166
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,511
Okay. Good to meet you.

167
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,674
<i>You were also good tonight,
very... precise.</i>

168
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,558
- Thanks.
- Nice to meet you, Angela.

169
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,234
Honey... I am so proud of you.

170
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,949
You know, I watched you very closely.
You didn't screw up once.

171
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,037
Okay, uh, we have to go.

172
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,554
- So what are you girls doing now?
- Dad.

173
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,757
- We're going out for pizza.
- Really? Do you need a ride? We can give you a ride.

174
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,389
- I have a car. You want to come with us?
- Thanks, but I have a car.

175
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,109
You <i>have</i> a car.
That's great. That's great.

176
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,953
Janie's thinking about getting a car,
too, soon, aren't you?

177
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:42,237
Dad, Mom's waiting for you.

178
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,628
Well, it was very nice meeting you, Angela.

179
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,075
<i>Any friend of Janie's...</i>

180
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,872
<i>is a... friend of mine.</i>

181
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,308
Well... I'll be seeing you around, then.

182
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,437
Could he be any more... pathetic?

183
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,353
I think he's sweet.

184
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,434
And I think he and your mother
have not had sex in a long time.

185
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,198
<i>It's the weirdest thing.</i>

186
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,590
<i>I feel like I've been in a coma
for about 20 years...</i>

187
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,717
<i>and I'm just now waking up.</i>

188
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,071
<i>Spec-tacular.</i>

189
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,791
I'm so sorry my dad was weird tonight.

190
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,557
That's okay.

191
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,870
I'm used to guys drooling over me.

192
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,275
It started when I was about 12.

193
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,318
I'd go to dinner with my parents.

194
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,392
Every Thursday night: Red Lobster.

195
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,313
Every guy there would stare at me
when I walked in.

196
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,470
And I knew what they were thinking,

197
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,314
just like I knew guys at school
thought about me when they jerked off.

198
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,039
- Vomit.
- No. I liked it.

199
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,511
I still like it. If people I don't even know
look at me and want to fuck me,

200
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,593
it means I really have a shot
at being a model.

201
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,875
Which is great,

202
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,839
because there's nothing worse in life
than being ordinary.

203
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,269
I really think it'll happen for you.

204
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,151
I know.

205
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,711
Because everything that was meant to happen,
does... eventually.

206
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,754
Asshole.

207
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,590
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

208
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,310
- Hello?
- Why'd you call me?

209
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,231
<i>I didn't.</i>

210
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,754
Well, my phone just rang and I answered it,
and somebody hung up.

211
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,277
- And I star-69ed, and I called you back.
- Well, I was in the shower.

212
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,036
Oh, gross!

213
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,754
<i>Ricky! Breakfast!</i>

214
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,669
Be right there.

215
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,357
- Mom.
- Hello.

216
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,637
I don't eat bacon, remember?

217
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,593
I'm sorry. I must've forgotten.

218
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,113
What's new in the world, Dad?

219
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,829
This country is going straight to hell.

220
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,313
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

221
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,430
No.

222
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,070
- Hi.
- Welcome to the neighborhood.

223
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,276
- It's just a little something from our garden.
- Except for the pasta.

224
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,874
- We got that at Fallaci's.
- Right. It's unbelievably fresh.

225
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,396
You just... You drop it in the water,
and it's done.

226
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,155
Jim Olmeyer. Two doors down.
Welcome to the neighborhood.

227
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,470
Colonel Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.

228
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,030
- It's nice to meet you. This is my partner...
- Jim Berkley, but call me J.B.

229
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,271
Let's cut to chase, okay?
What are you guys selling?

230
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,273
- We...
- Nothing. We just wanted to say hi to our new neighbors.

231
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,673
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You said you're partners,
so what's your business?

232
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,074
Well... he is a tax attorney.

233
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,038
And he's an anesthesiologist.

234
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:35,638
How come these faggots
always have to rub it in your face?

235
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,678
How can they be so shameless?

236
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,152
That's the whole thing, Dad.

237
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:46,391
They don't feel that's anything
to be ashamed of.

238
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,869
Well, it is.

239
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,672
- Yeah, you're right.
- Don't placate me like I'm your mother, boy.

240
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,239
Forgive me, sir, for speaking so bluntly,

241
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,232
but those fags make me want
to puke my fucking guts out.

242
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,629
Well, me too, son.
Yeah. Me too.

243
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,268
<i>I'm serious. He just pulled down his pants
and yanked it out.</i>

244
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,875
- <i>You know, like, "Say hello to Mr. Happy."</i>
- Gross!

245
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,590
- It wasn't gross. It was kind of cool.
- So did you do it with him?

246
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,832
<i>Of course I did. He's a really
well-known photographer.</i>

247
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,559
He shoots for <i>Elle</i> on,
like, a regular basis.

248
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,191
- It would've been majorly stupid of me to turn him down.
- You are a total prostitute.

249
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,239
Hey, that's how things really are.

250
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,995
You just don't know because
you're this pampered little suburban chick.

251
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,516
<i>So are you. You've only been in</i> Seventeen
<i>once, and you looked fat.</i>

252
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,115
So stop acting like you're
goddamn Christy Turlington!

253
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,191
Cunt!

254
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,956
I am so sick of people
taking their insecurities out on me.

255
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,718
- <i>Oh, my God. That's the pervert who filmed me last night.</i>
- Him?

256
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,712
<i>Jane. No way. He's a total lunatic.</i>

257
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,631
- Do you know him?
- Yeah.

258
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,836
We were on the same lunch shift
when I was in ninth grade,

259
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,310
and he would always save
the most random, weird things.

260
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,598
And then one day, he was just,
like, gone.

261
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:35,277
And then Connie Cardullo told me that his parents
had to put him in a mental institution.

262
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,396
Why? What did he do?

263
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,233
What do you mean?

264
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,279
Well, they can't put you away
just for saying weird things.

265
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:51,515
You total slut.
You've got a crush on him.

266
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,273
- What? Please!
- You are defending him. You love him.

267
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,511
- You want to have, like, 10,000 of his babies.
- Shut up.

268
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,673
<i>Hi. My name's Ricky.
I just moved next door to you.</i>

269
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,716
I know.

270
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,759
I kind of remember this creepy incident
where you were filming me last night?

271
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,753
- I didn't mean to scare you. I just think you're interesting.
- <i>Thanks.</i>

272
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,277
But I really don't need to have some psycho
obsessing about me right now.

273
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,114
I'm not obsessing. I'm just curious.

274
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,517
What a freak.

275
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,751
And why does he dress
like a Bible salesman?

276
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,832
He's, like, so confident.

277
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,832
<i>That can't be real.</i>

278
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,354
I don't believe him.

279
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,353
I mean, he didn't even, like,
look at me once.

280
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,193
- <i>How'd you get in the Army?</i>
- <i>Sergeant, I got three reasons for being in the Army.</i>

281
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,159
<i>First, I'm patriotic. Second, I love my country.
And third, they nailed me.</i>

282
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,831
Hey.

283
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,315
- <i>What's going on here?</i>
- <i>Bend all the way down. Here comes the</i> Bull of the Woods.

284
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,588
I'm sorry. What?

285
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,915
Mom, nobody said anything.

286
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,355
Oh. I'm sorry.

287
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,556
Everyone here is with their spouse
or significant other.

288
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,552
- How would it look if I showed up with no one?
- You always end up ignoring me.

289
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,996
Now, listen to me.
This is an important business function.

290
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,117
As you know, my business
is selling an image,

291
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,430
and part of my job is to live that image.

292
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,798
Honey, do me a favor and say whatever you want to say
and spare me the propaganda.

293
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,678
All right. Hi, Shirley!

294
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,913
Listen. Just do me a favor.
Act happy tonight.

295
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,596
- I am happy, honey!
- You're not... Oh, that's Buddy!

296
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:18,990
- <i>Buddy! Buddy! Hi!</i>
- Hi.

297
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,435
Good to see you again.

298
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,876
- It's so good to see you too, Catherine.
- Carolyn.

299
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,793
Oh, Carolyn! Of course.
How are you?

300
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,668
- Very well, thank you. Hello, Christy.
- Hello.

301
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,553
- My husband, Lester.
- It's a pleasure.

302
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:40,555
Oh, we've met before, actually.
This thing last year. Christmas at the Sheraton.

303
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,790
Oh, yeah!

304
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,872
Oh, it's okay.
I wouldn't remember me either.

305
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,149
Honey, don't be weird.

306
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,959
- All right, honey. I won't be weird.
- Okay.

307
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,157
I'll be whatever you want me to be.

308
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,629
Well, oka...

309
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,993
- We have a very healthy relationship.
- I see.

310
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,272
Well, I don't know about you guys,
but I need a drink.

311
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,318
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Put a little more in there, cowboy.

312
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,594
<i>Excuse me. Don't you live on Robin Hood Trail?
The house with the red door?</i>

313
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,390
- Yeah.
- I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved in the house next to you.

314
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,553
Oh. Hi, Ricky Fitts. I'm Lester Burnham.

315
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,074
Hi, Lester Burnham.

316
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,036
- Do you party?
- Excuse me?

317
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,192
Do you get high?

318
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,191
You know, I probably wouldn't even tell you this
if I weren't a little tipsy, but...

319
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,359
I'm in complete awe of you.

320
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,749
I mean, your firm...

321
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,674
is hands-down the Rolls-Royce
of local real estate firms,

322
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,116
and your personal sales record is...

323
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,079
It's very intimidating.

324
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:45,950
You know, I'd love to sit down with you
and just pick your brain,

325
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,793
if you'd ever be willing.

326
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,676
You know, I suppose technically
I'm the competition,

327
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,309
but I mean, hey, I don't flatter myself...

328
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,756
that I'm even in the same league as you.

329
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,956
I don't.

330
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,917
I'd love to.

331
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,238
- Really?
- Absolutely.

332
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,471
Call my secretary.
Have her schedule a lunch.

333
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,633
I'll do that. Thank you.

334
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,916
Did you ever see that movie
where the body is walking around...

335
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,072
carrying its own head,
and then the head goes down on that babe?

336
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,913
<i>Re-Animator.</i>

337
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,957
Look.

338
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,271
I'm not paying you to do
whatever it is you're doing out here.

339
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,158
Fine. So don't pay me.

340
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,231
Excuse me?

341
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,030
I quit, so you don't have to pay me.
Now leave me alone.

342
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,350
Asshole.

343
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,872
I think you just became my personal hero.

344
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,270
Doesn't that make you nervous,
just quitting your job like that?

345
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,992
Well, I guess when you're all of,
what, 16...

346
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,358
Eighteen. I just do these gigs as a cover.

347
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,398
I have other sources of income.

348
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,994
But my dad interferes less in my life
when I pretend...

349
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,277
to be an upstanding young citizen
with a respectable job.

350
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,351
Lester?

351
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,119
- What are you doing?
- Honey, this is... Ricky Fitts.

352
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,875
This is Ricky Fitts.

353
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,078
I'm Ricky Fitts.
I just moved into the house next to you.

354
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:43,038
I go to school with your daughter.

355
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,634
- With Jane?
- Yeah.

356
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,314
- Really?
- Jane.

357
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:52,791
Hi. I'm ready to go.
I'll meet you out front.

358
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,968
Oh, I'm in trouble.

359
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,758
Nice meeting you, Ricky.
Thanks for the thing.

360
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,593
Anytime. Lester?

361
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,116
If you want any more,
you know where I live.

362
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,198
Oh, shit. They're home. Quick.
Let's go up to my room.

363
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,635
I should say hi to your dad.

364
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:33,712
I don't want to be rude.

365
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,076
Nice suit.

366
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,071
You're looking good, Mr. Burnham.

367
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,755
Last time I saw you,
you looked kind of wound up.

368
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,515
Oh, is that root beer?

369
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,631
I love root beer, don't you?

370
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,831
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.

371
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,036
- Hi.
- Remember Angela?

372
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,111
Yes, of course.

373
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,795
I forgot to tell you.
She's going to spend the night. Is that okay?

374
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,836
- <i>Sorry about my dad.</i>
- <i>Don't be. I think it's funny.</i>

375
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,755
Yeah, to you he's just another guy
who wants to jump your bones.

376
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,470
But to me, he's just...
too embarrassing to live.

377
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,475
Well, your mom's the one who's embarrassing.
What a phony.

378
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,677
- But your dad's actually kind of cute.
- <i>Shut up.</i>

379
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,355
<i>He is. If he just worked out a little,
he'd be hot.</i>

380
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,317
- Shut up!
- Come on.

381
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,076
Like you've never sneaked a peek at him
in his underwear? I bet he's got a big dick.

382
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,390
<i>You are so grossing me out right now.</i>

383
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,597
<i>If he built up his chest and arms,
I would totally fuck him.</i>

384
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,753
- <i>La, la, la, la, la, la</i>
- I would. I would suck your dad's big fat dick,

385
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,798
and then I'd fuck him
until his eyes rolled back in his head.

386
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,395
Jane, shh. What was that noise?

387
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,520
- I swear I heard something.
- Yeah.

388
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,433
That was the sound of you being a huge,
disgusting pig.

389
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,875
No, I'm serious.

390
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,599
See?

391
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,831
- Oh, my God. Jane.
- <i>What is it?</i>

392
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,076
<i>It's that psycho next door.</i>

393
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,230
Jane, what if he worships you?

394
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:36,235
What if he's got a shrine with pictures of you
surrounded by dead people's heads and stuff?

395
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,630
Shit. I bet he's filming us right now.

396
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,597
Really?

397
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,234
Welcome to <i>America's Weirdest Home Videos.</i>

398
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,052
<i>Ricky?</i>

399
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,070
Coming, Dad.

400
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:44,550
<i>You know I don't like
locked doors in my house, boy.</i>

401
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,356
I'm sorry.
I must've locked it by accident.

402
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,914
So what's up?

403
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,559
I... I need a urine sample.

404
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,154
It's been six months already.

405
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,198
Can I give it to you in the morning?
I just took a whiz.

406
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,316
Yeah. I suppose.

407
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,753
Y-You know...

408
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,635
Well, good night, son.

409
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,191
I've been waiting for you.

410
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,554
You've been working out, haven't you?

411
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,710
I can tell.

412
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,118
I was hoping you could give me a bath.

413
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,634
I'm very, very dirty.

414
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,390
What are you doing?

415
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,636
Nothing.

416
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,188
- You were masturbating.
- I was not.

417
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,953
Yes, you were.

418
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,635
Oh, all right. So shoot me.
I was whacking off.

419
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,156
That's right. I was choking the bishop,
chafing the carrot.

420
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,038
You know, saying "hi" to my monster.

421
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,951
That's disgusting.

422
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,032
Well, excuse me, but some of us
still have blood pumping through our veins.

423
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,270
- So do I.
- Really?

424
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,512
Well, I'm the only one who seems
to be doing anything about it.

425
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,036
Lester, I refuse to live like this!

426
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,997
This is not a marriage.

427
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,038
This hasn't been a marriage for years,

428
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,953
but you were happy
as long as I kept my mouth shut.

429
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,996
Well, guess what. I've changed.

430
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,548
And the new me whacks off
when he feels horny...

431
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,313
'cause you're obviously not going
to help me out in that department.

432
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,960
I see. You think you're the only one
who's sexually frustrated.

433
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,032
I'm not? Well, then, come on, baby.
I'm ready.

434
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,190
Don't you mess with me, mister.

435
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,272
I will divorce you so fast,
it'll make your head spin.

436
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,430
On what grounds?

437
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,988
I'm not a drunk.
I don't fuck other women.

438
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,389
I don't mistreat you.
I've never hit you.

439
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,948
I don't even try to touch you,
since you made it so abundantly clear...

440
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,235
just how unnecessary you consider me to be!

441
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,436
<i>But... I did support you
when you got your license.</i>

442
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,433
And some people might think that
entitles me to half of what's yours.

443
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:03,239
Oh!

444
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,915
So, turn out the light
when you come back to bed, okay?

445
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,718
<i>It's a great thing
when you realize you still have...</i>

446
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,268
<i>the ability to surprise yourself.</i>

447
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,148
<i>Makes you wonder what else you can do
that you've forgotten about.</i>

448
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,117
Hey, guys.

449
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,509
Lester. I didn't know you ran.

450
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,830
- I just started.
- Good for you.

451
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,833
I figured you guys might be able to give me some pointers.
I need to shape up, fast.

452
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,593
Are you looking to just lose weight,
or do you want to have...

453
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,478
increased strength and flexibility as well?

454
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:46,870
I... I want to look good naked.

455
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:05,676
<i>Oh, what is this?
Fuckin' gay pride parade?</i>

456
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,751
Hey! Yo, Ricky.

457
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,591
My entire life is passing before my eyes,
and those two have barely broken a sweat.

458
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,797
Sorry. Hi. Lester Burnham.
I live next door. We haven't met.

459
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,791
Colonel Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.

460
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,838
Oh, whoa. Well.

461
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,070
Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.

462
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,713
Ricky, uh...

463
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,236
I was thinking about the, uh... I was gonna...
The movie we talked about.

464
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:38,151
- <i>Re-Animator.</i>
- Yeah!

465
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,835
You want to borrow it?
Okay. It's up in my room. Come on.

466
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,868
- Can you hold this for a sec?
- Sure.

467
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,873
I don't think my dad would try to come in
while someone else is here, but you never know.

468
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,872
- What is this?
- Urine.

469
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,158
I have to take a drug test every six months
just to make sure I'm clean.

470
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,038
Are you kidding?
You just smoked with me last night.

471
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,111
It's not mine.

472
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,795
One of my clients is a nurse
in a pediatrician's office.

473
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,316
Cut her a deal,
she keeps me in clean piss.

474
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,231
You like Pink Floyd?

475
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:26,075
I like a lot of music.

476
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,438
Man, I haven't listened to this album in years.

477
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,829
How much do you want?

478
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,674
I don't know. It's been a while.
Um, how much is an ounce?

479
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,998
This is totally decent, and it's 300.

480
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,668
This shit is top of the line.

481
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,230
It's called G-13.
It's genetically engineered by the U.S. government.

482
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,949
It's extremely potent,
but a completely mellow high. No paranoia.

483
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:00,758
Is that what we smoked last night?

484
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,354
This is all I ever smoke.

485
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,396
- How much?
- Two grand.

486
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,630
Jesus!

487
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,439
Things have changed since 1973.

488
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,115
- You don't have to pay now. I know you're good for it.
- Thanks.

489
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,430
There's a card in there
with my beeper number.

490
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,717
<i>Beep me anytime, day or night.</i>

491
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,916
And I only accept cash.

492
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,629
Now I know how you can afford
all this equipment.

493
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,430
God. When I was your age, I flipped burgers all summer
just to buy an eight-track.

494
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,399
- That sucks.
- No, actually it was great.

495
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,793
All I did was party and get laid.

496
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,318
I had my whole life ahead of me.

497
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,272
My dad thinks I pay for all this
with catering jobs.

498
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,193
Never underestimate the power of denial.

499
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,588
<i>There must be some way out of here</i>

500
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,069
<i>Said the joker to the thief</i>

501
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,836
<i>There's too much confusion</i>

502
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,833
- <i>I can't get no relief</i>
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

503
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,639
Mom's mad.

504
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:37,676
Bench presses.

505
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,197
I'm going to whale on my pecks,
and then I'm going to do my back.

506
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,989
I see you're smoking pot now.
I... I'm so glad.

507
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,435
I think using illegal psychotropic substances...

508
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,909
is a very positive example
to set for our daughter.

509
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,073
You're one to talk, you bloodless,
money-grubbing freak.

510
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,151
Uh... Lester!

511
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,196
You have such hostility in you.

512
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,353
Do you mind? I'm trying to work out here.
Unless... you want to spot me.

513
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,876
Lester, you will not get away with this.

514
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,952
- You can be sure of that.
- <i>There are many here among us</i>

515
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,476
- That's... what...
- <i>Who feel that life is but a joke</i>

516
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,551
you... think.

517
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,110
"My job consists of basically masking...

518
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,749
"my contempt for the assholes in charge...

519
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:27,310
"and at least once a day
retiring to the men's room...

520
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,470
"so I can jerk off...

521
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,074
"while I fantasize about a life...

522
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,436
that doesn't so closely resemble hell."

523
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,069
Well, you obviously have no interest
in saving yourself.

524
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,153
Brad, for 14 years, I've been a whore
for the advertising industry.

525
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,789
The only way I could save myself now
is if I start firebombing.

526
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,429
Whatever. Management wants you gone
by the end of the day.

527
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,512
Just what sort of severance package
is management prepared to offer me,

528
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:56,034
considering the information
I have about our editorial director...

529
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,951
buying pussy with company money?

530
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,634
<i>Which I think would interest the I.R.S.,</i>

531
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,676
since it technically constitutes fraud.

532
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,558
And I'm sure that some of our advertisers
and rival publications...

533
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,758
might like to know about it as well,
not to mention... Craig's wife.

534
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,799
- What do you want?
- One year's salary <i>with</i> benefits.

535
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,917
That's not going to happen.

536
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,197
What do you say I throw in
a little sexual harassment charge to boot?

537
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:25,875
Against who?

538
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:27,712
Against you.

539
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,156
<i>Can you prove that you
didn't offer to save my job...</i>

540
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,674
if I let you blow me?

541
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,836
Man... you are one twisted fuck.

542
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,272
Nope. I'm just an ordinary guy...

543
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,954
with nothing to lose.

544
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,597
Yeah.

545
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,394
- Carolyn.
- Buddy.

546
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:06,519
- I am so sorry to have kept you waiting.
- Oh.

547
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,875
Christy left for New York this morning.

548
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,270
Let's just say things were a little...
hectic around the house.

549
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:16,716
- What's she doing in New York?
- She's moving there.

550
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,711
Yes, we are splitting up.

551
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,268
Buddy. I'm so sorry.

552
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,875
Yes. According to her, I'm...

553
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,871
too focused on my career.

554
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,838
As if being driven to succeed is...

555
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,469
some sort of a character flaw.

556
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,348
Well, she certainly did take advantage
of the lifestyle my success afforded her.

557
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,637
It's for the best.

558
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,032
When I saw you two at the party the other night,
you seemed perfectly happy.

559
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,680
Well, call me crazy,

560
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,072
but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful,

561
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,799
one <i>must</i> project an image of success...

562
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,871
<i>at all times.</i>

563
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,318
<i>What are you doing?</i>

564
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,870
- <i>I was filming this dead bird.</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

565
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,076
<i>Because it's beautiful.</i>

566
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,995
<i>I think maybe you forgot your medication today,
mental boy.</i>

567
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,757
<i>Hi, Jane.</i>

568
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,149
<i>Look, I want you to stop filming me.</i>

569
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,911
Okay.

570
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,434
Well, whatever. This is boring.

571
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,114
Let's go.

572
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,431
- Do you need a ride?
- <i>Are you crazy?</i>

573
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:55,671
I don't want to end up hacked to pieces
in a Dumpster somewhere.

574
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,070
It's okay. I'll walk. But thanks.

575
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,435
He doesn't want to go anyway. Let's go.

576
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,235
- <i>Come on, Jane.</i>
- I think I'm going to walk too.

577
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:08,356
<i>What?</i>

578
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:12,194
Jane, that's, like, almost a mile.

579
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,595
<i>Oh, God!</i>

580
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:29,989
I love it! Oh! Oh!

581
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,197
- You like getting nailed by the King?
- Oh, yes, I love it!

582
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,953
- Fuck me, Your Majesty!
- Oh!

583
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,996
- Who's the King?
- Oh! You are!

584
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,710
<i>American woman</i>

585
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,598
<i>Stay away from me</i>

586
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,830
<i>American woman</i>

587
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,229
<i>Mama, let me be</i>

588
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:07,910
<i>Don't come knockin' around my door</i>

589
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,468
<i>I don't wanna see your face no more</i>

590
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,835
<i>I got better things to do</i>

591
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,388
<i>Than spend my life
growin' old with you</i>

592
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,311
<i>Now, woman</i>

593
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,630
<i>Said stay away</i>

594
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,950
<i>Smile. You're at Mr. Smiley's.</i>

595
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,871
What?

596
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:28,033
<i>Would you like to try our new bacon and egg fajita
for $1.29 for a limited time only?</i>

597
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,918
Uh, no, but thank you.

598
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,834
I'd like the Big Barn Burger,
Smiley Fries and an orange soda.

599
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,275
<i>Please drive up to the window.
Thank you.</i>

600
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,550
Smile. You're at Mr. Smiley's.
That'll be 4.98, please.

601
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,710
<i>Mama, let me be</i>

602
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,950
- Would you like some Smiley sauce?
- <i>No, no...</i>

603
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,600
<i>Actually, I'd like to fill out an application.</i>

604
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,468
- There's no jobs for manager. It's just for counter.
- Good.

605
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:58,400
I'm looking for the least
possible amount of responsibility.

606
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,635
I don't think you'd fit in here.

607
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,712
I have fast food experience.

608
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,995
Yeah, like 20 years ago.

609
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,789
I'm sure there've been amazing
technological advances in the industry,

610
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,348
but surely you must have
some sort of training program.

611
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,113
It seems unfair to presume
I won't be able to learn.

612
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,471
That was exactly what I needed...

613
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:30,232
the "royal treatment," so to speak.

614
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,137
I was so stressed out.

615
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,079
Know what I do when I feel like that?

616
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,355
What?

617
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,238
- I fire a gun.
- Really?

618
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:52,073
Oh, yeah. I go to this
little firing range downtown,

619
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,312
and I... just pop off a few rounds.

620
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:00,154
- I've never fired a gun before.
- Well, you've gotta try it.

621
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,038
Nothing makes you feel more powerful.

622
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,270
Well...

623
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,430
almost nothing.

624
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,996
- So, do you like your new house?
- I like it.

625
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,436
The people who used to live there
fed these stray cats, so they were always around,

626
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:23,080
and it drove my mother nuts.

627
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,948
And then she cut down their tree.

628
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:29,031
Is that a funeral?

629
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:33,238
Yeah. Have you ever known
anybody who died?

630
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,118
No. Have you?

631
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,191
No.

632
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,999
But I did see this homeless woman
who froze to death once...

633
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,389
just laying there on the sidewalk.

634
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,630
She looked really sad.

635
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,078
I got that homeless woman on videotape.

636
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:03,151
Why would you film that?

637
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,835
- Because it was amazing.
- What's amazing about it?

638
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,879
When you see something like that,
it's like God is looking right at you,

639
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,871
just for a second,

640
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,679
and if you're careful,
you can look right back.

641
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:18,479
And what do you see?

642
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,471
Beauty.

643
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,672
Mom, I want you to meet somebody.

644
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,158
- Mom.
- Yes?

645
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,279
I want you to meet somebody.
This is Jane.

646
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:53,555
- <i>Hi.</i>
- Oh, my.

647
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,996
I apologize for the way
things look around here.

648
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,034
<i>This is where my dad hides out.</i>

649
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:11,475
<i>I take it he's got a thing for guns.</i>

650
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,748
You gotta see this one thing.

651
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:20,116
My dad would kill me
if he knew I was in here.

652
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:22,111
Did you steal his keys?

653
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,998
No. One of my clients is a locksmith.

654
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,868
He was short on cash one night,
so I let him pay me in trade.

655
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,630
Turn it over.

656
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,320
Oh, my God.

657
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,709
It's, like, official state china
of the Third Reich.

658
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:55,554
There's a whole subculture of people
who collect this Nazi shit.

659
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,029
But my dad just has this one thing.

660
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,831
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

661
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,798
No, you're scared of me.

662
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,910
No, I'm not.

663
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,312
<i>You want to see the most beautiful thing
I've ever filmed?</i>

664
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,429
It was one of those days...

665
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,353
where it's a minute away from snowing,

666
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:55,313
and there was this electricity in the air.

667
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,148
You can almost hear it.

668
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,231
Right?

669
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:09,515
And this bag was just...

670
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,273
dancing with me,

671
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:18,876
like a little kid
begging me to play with it,

672
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,428
for 15 minutes.

673
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:28,673
That's the day I realized
that there was this...

674
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,514
entire life behind things...

675
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:39,433
<i>and this incredibly benevolent force...</i>

676
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,638
<i>that wanted me to know
that there was no reason to be afraid...</i>

677
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:47,276
<i>ever.</i>

678
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:51,914
<i>Video's a poor excuse, I know,</i>

679
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,949
<i>but it helps me remember.</i>

680
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,829
<i>I need to remember.</i>

681
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,557
Sometimes there's so much...

682
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:15,393
beauty...

683
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:17,789
in the world.

684
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:22,470
I feel like I can't take it...

685
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,239
and my heart...

686
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,754
is just going to...

687
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:33,070
cave in.

688
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,116
Oh, my God. What time is it?

689
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:30,314
- Sorry I'm late.
- No, that's quite all right, dear.

690
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,153
Your father and I were just discussing
his day at work.

691
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,549
Why don't you tell our daughter
about it, honey?

692
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,552
Janie, today I quit my job.

693
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,438
Then I told my boss to go fuck himself,
and then I blackmailed him for almost $60,000.

694
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:43,272
- Pass the asparagus.
- <i>Your father seems to think...</i>

695
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,715
this kind of behavior
is something to be proud of.

696
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,439
And your mother seems to prefer
that I go through life like a fucking prisoner...

697
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:50,670
while she keeps my dick
in a Mason jar under the sink.

698
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,228
How dare you speak to me
that way in front of her?

699
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,788
And I marvel that you can be
so contemptuous of me...

700
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,269
on the same day that you lose your job!

701
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:00,430
I didn't lose it. It's not like,
"Whoops, where did my job go?"

702
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,351
I quit! Pass the asparagus.

703
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,557
<i>Oh, oh, oh! And I want to thank you
for putting me under the added pressure...</i>

704
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,596
of being the sole breadwinner now.

705
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,511
- I already have a job.
- <i>No, no!</i>

706
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,068
<i>Don't give a second thought
as to who's going to pay the mortgage.</i>

707
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:14,310
We'll leave it up to Carolyn.
"You're going to take care of everything now, Carolyn?"

708
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,072
"Yes. I don't mind."

709
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,674
<i>"Everything? You don't mind
having the sole responsibility?</i>

710
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,228
Your husband feels he can just
quit his job, and you don't..."

711
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,436
Will someone please pass me
the fucking asparagus?

712
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,988
- I'm not going to be a part of this.
- Sit down!

713
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:30,278
<i>And I'm irresponsibly mad</i>

714
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:33,079
<i>For you</i>

715
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:36,118
<i>Go on and call me</i>

716
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,031
<i>Unpredictable</i>

717
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:41,999
<i>Tell me that I'm impractical</i>

718
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:45,470
<i>Rainbows
I'm inclined to pursue</i>

719
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:48,757
I am sick and tired of being treated
like I don't exist.

720
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:52,753
You two do whatever you want to do
whenever you want to do it, and I don't complain.

721
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,957
- All I want...
- Oh, you don't complain? Oh, please! Excuse me!

722
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,838
I must be psychotic then!
If you don't complain, what is this?

723
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:03,118
<i>Yeah, let's bring in the laugh meter
and see how loud it gets on that one.</i>

724
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,634
<i>Mad for you</i>

725
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,595
Don't interrupt me, honey.

726
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,911
And another thing.

727
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,468
From now on, we're going to alternate
our dinner music,

728
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:36,028
because, frankly...
and I don't think I'm alone here...

729
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,351
I am really tired of this Lawrence Welk shit.

730
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,948
<i>A bright, shiny world</i>

731
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:50,160
- Go away.
- <i>Please.</i>

732
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,276
<i>Please let me in.</i>

733
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:03,472
Look, I wish that you hadn't witnessed
that awful scene tonight,

734
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,391
but in a way, I'm glad.

735
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:08,950
Why? So I could see what freaks
you and Dad really are?

736
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,031
Me?

737
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:15,199
God.

738
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,794
Oh, Christ. Mom.

739
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,633
No, I'm glad because, uh...

740
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:28,033
because you're old enough now to learn
the most important lesson in life:

741
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:32,113
You cannot count on anyone
except yourself.

742
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:39,797
You cannot count on anyone
except yourself.

743
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,919
You know, it's sad but true,

744
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,275
and the sooner you learn it, the better.

745
01:05:46,360 --> 01:05:50,114
Look, Mom, I really don't feel
like having a Kodak moment here.

746
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,919
You ungrateful little brat!

747
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,912
Just look at everything you have!

748
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,468
When I was your age,
I lived in a duplex!

749
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:02,348
We didn't even have our own house.

750
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:00,831
- <i>You little bastard!</i>
- <i>Dad, no, I just...</i>

751
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,911
How did you get in there?

752
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,752
How? How?

753
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,870
Come on! Get up! Come on!

754
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,712
<i>Get up!</i>

755
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,711
<i>Fight back, you little pussy!</i>

756
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,394
- No, sir, I won't fight you.
- How?

757
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:18,313
- How did you get in there?
- I picked the lock, sir.

758
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,915
What were you looking for, huh?
Money? Are you on dope again?

759
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,629
No, sir. I wanted to show my girlfriend
your Nazi plate.

760
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,438
A girlfriend?

761
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,080
Yes, sir. She lives next door.

762
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:44,040
<i>Her name's Jane.</i>

763
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:06,038
This is for your own good, boy.

764
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:12,751
You have no respect for other people's things
and for authority...

765
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:14,796
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

766
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:18,873
Can't just go around doing
whatever you feel like.

767
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,269
You can't. There are rules in life.

768
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:23,999
Yes, sir.

769
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,156
You need structure, yeah. You need...

770
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:32,038
- Discipline.
- Yes, sir. Thank you for trying to teach me.

771
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,350
Don't give up on me, Dad.

772
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,791
Oh, Ricky.

773
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,120
You stay out of there.

774
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:35,830
I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham,

775
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:39,708
when you first came here, I thought you
would be hopeless, but you're a natural.

776
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,190
Well, all I know is
I love shooting this gun.

777
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,237
<i>Don't tell me not to fly
I've simply got to</i>

778
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,392
<i>If someone takes a spill
it's me and not you</i>

779
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:57,555
<i>Don't bring around the cloud
to rain on my parade</i>

780
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:00,632
<i>I'm gonna march my band out</i>

781
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:04,076
<i>I'll beat my drum</i>

782
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:07,311
<i>And if I'm found out</i>

783
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,595
<i>Your turn at bat, sir</i>

784
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:11,671
- <i>Hey</i>
- <i>At least I didn't fake it</i>

785
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,911
<i>Hat, sir, so what I didn't make it</i>

786
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,232
<i>Nobody</i>

787
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:24,633
<i>I said nobody</i>

788
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:27,280
<i>Nobody</i>

789
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,796
<i>Had better rain</i>

790
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:33,519
<i>On my</i>

791
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,559
<i>Parade</i>

792
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:39,517
<i>Yeah</i>

793
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:55,231
What?

794
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,834
Uh, whose car is that out front?

795
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,309
Mine. 1970 Pontiac Firebird,

796
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:03,119
the car I've always wanted,
and now I have it.

797
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:05,794
- I rule!
- Uh-huh. Where's the Camry?

798
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,871
I traded it in.

799
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:12,078
- Shouldn't you have consulted me first?
- Hm, let me think.

800
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:14,310
No. You never drove it.

801
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,918
Have you done something different?
You look great.

802
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,671
Where's Jane?

803
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,876
Jane not home.

804
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:35,991
We have...

805
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:41,432
the whole house...

806
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,954
to ourselves.

807
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:48,759
Christ, Carolyn.

808
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,149
When did you become so...

809
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:55,672
joyless?

810
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,228
Joyless?

811
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,754
I am not joyless.

812
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:03,308
There happens to be a lot about me...

813
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:07,154
that you don't know, Mr. Smarty Man.

814
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,437
There's plenty of joy in my life.

815
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,149
Whatever happened to that girl...

816
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:23,558
who used to fake seizures at frat parties
when she got bored?

817
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:28,270
Who used to run up to the roof
of our first apartment building...

818
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:30,999
to flash the traffic helicopters?

819
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:35,551
Have you totally forgotten about her?

820
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:37,710
Because I haven't.

821
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:53,397
Lester, you're going to spill beer
on the couch.

822
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,031
So what? It's just a couch.

823
01:14:04,280 --> 01:14:06,475
This is a $4,000 sofa,

824
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:08,391
upholstered in Italian silk.

825
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,471
This is not just a couch.

826
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,155
It's just... a... couch!

827
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:16,356
This isn't life!

828
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:18,510
This is just stuff,

829
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,068
and it's become more important to you
than living.

830
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:23,276
Well, honey, that's just nuts.

831
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:34,349
I'm only trying to help you!

832
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:41,953
<i>Don't.</i>

833
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:44,031
<i>Why?</i>

834
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:49,069
<i>It's weird watching myself.</i>

835
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:51,469
<i>I don't like how I look.</i>

836
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:56,758
<i>I can't believe you don't know
how beautiful you are.</i>

837
01:14:56,840 --> 01:15:00,674
<i>Look. I'm not going to sit here
for that shit.</i>

838
01:15:09,960 --> 01:15:11,558
How does it feel now?

839
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,517
Fine.

840
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,511
You don't feel naked?

841
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:18,990
<i>I am naked.</i>

842
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,389
You know what I mean.

843
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:33,078
So tell me about being in the hospital.

844
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:39,794
<i>When I was 15,
my dad caught me smoking dope.</i>

845
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:44,829
<i>He totally freaked and decided
to send me to military school.</i>

846
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:48,276
<i>I told you this whole thing
about structure and discipline, right?</i>

847
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:51,796
<i>Of course, I got kicked out.</i>

848
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:54,189
<i>Dad and I had this huge fight.</i>

849
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:57,272
<i>He hit me.</i>

850
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:01,148
<i>And the next day at school,
some kid made a crack about my haircut,</i>

851
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,916
and I just snapped.

852
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,671
I wanted to kill him.

853
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,035
I would've... killed him...

854
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:18,428
if they hadn't pulled me off.

855
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:25,279
<i>That's when my dad
put me in the hospital.<i>

856
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:29,035
<i>They drugged me up and left me in there
for two years.<i>

857
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,072
<i>You must really hate him.</i>

858
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:36,720
<i>No.</i>

859
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,470
<i>He's not a bad man.</i>

860
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,997
Well, you'd better believe I'd hate my dad
if he did something like that to me.

861
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:46,798
<i>Wait.</i>

862
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,075
I already do hate my dad.

863
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:52,876
Why?

864
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,236
He's a total asshole,
he's got this crush on my friend Angela,

865
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,436
and it's disgusting.

866
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:02,910
You'd rather he had the crush on you.

867
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,195
<i>Gross. No.</i>

868
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:13,752
<i>But it'd be nice if I was anywhere near
as important to him as she is.</i>

869
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:21,430
<i>I know you think my dad's harmless,
but you're wrong.</i>

870
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,637
<i>He's doing massive psychological damage to me.</i>

871
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,790
How?

872
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,270
<i>Well, now I, too, need structure,</i>

873
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:33,397
<i>a little fucking discipline.</i>

874
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,080
<i>I'm serious, though.</i>

875
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,958
<i>How could he not be damaging me?</i>

876
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:53,638
<i>I need a father who's a role model,</i>

877
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,188
<i>not some horny geek boy
who's going to spray his shorts...</i>

878
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:00,796
<i>whenever I bring a girlfriend
home from school.</i>

879
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,030
<i>What a lame-o.</i>

880
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,437
<i>Someone really should just...
put him out of his misery.</i>

881
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:14,354
Want me to kill him for you?

882
01:18:22,680 --> 01:18:24,750
<i>Yeah. Would you?</i>

883
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,317
It'll cost you.

884
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,960
<i>I've been baby-sitting
since I was about ten.</i>

885
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:33,474
<i>I've got almost $3,000.</i>

886
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:38,599
<i>Of course I was saving it up
for a boob job.</i>

887
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:42,110
<i>But...</i>

888
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:58,356
<i>You know, that's not
a very nice thing to do...</i>

889
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,995
<i>hiring someone to kill your dad.</i>

890
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:10,071
<i>Well, I guess I'm not
a very nice girl then, am I?</i>

891
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:34,234
You know I'm not serious, right?

892
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,236
Of course.

893
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:54,989
You know how lucky we are
to have found each other?

894
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,915
<i>Remember those posters that said...</i>

895
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:06,198
<i>"Today is the first day
of the rest of your life"?</i>

896
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:10,671
<i>Well, that's true with every day
except one...</i>

897
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,876
<i>the day you die.</i>

898
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,679
<i>I've looked under chairs</i>

899
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,035
<i>I've looked under tables</i>

900
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:22,511
<i>I've tried to find the key
to 50 million fables</i>

901
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,716
<i>They call me the Seeker</i>

902
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:31,197
<i>I've been searching low and high</i>

903
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:37,030
<i>I won't get to get what I'm after</i>

904
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:39,031
<i>Till the day I die</i>

905
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:49,271
<i>I asked Bobby Dylan
I asked the Beatles</i>

906
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,038
<i>Jane, hurry up.</i>

907
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:55,078
I've got a very important appointment.

908
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:59,153
- Is it okay if Angela sleeps over tonight?
- She's always welcome.

909
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:03,438
I thought you two had a fight.
I haven't seen her around here in a while.

910
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,997
What?

911
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:15,038
I've been too embarrassed
to bring her over,

912
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:17,588
because of you and that way
that you behave.

913
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,021
What are you talking about?

914
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:20,877
- I've barely even spoken to her.
- <i>Dad!</i>

915
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,157
You stare at her all the time
like you're drunk!

916
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,390
- <i>It's disgusting!</i>
- You better watch yourself,

917
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:30,951
or you're going to turn into a real bitch
just like your mother!

918
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,951
Oh, fuck.

919
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,949
You ready to go?

920
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:47,110
Oh, I-I don't need a ride.

921
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,509
I'm going with Jane and her mom.

922
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,071
Oh, morning!

923
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:00,037
<i>Yo, Ricky!</i>

924
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,918
- How's it going?
- Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.

925
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,036
Hey. Wait.

926
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:23,198
<i>I need that Super Smiley with cheese ASAP!</i>

927
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:26,033
- You need more than that, my little hombre.
- <i>May I take your order?</i>

928
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:28,998
- <i>Oh, yeah! What's good here?</i>
- <i>Nothing.</i>

929
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:31,992
<i>Oh, well, then I guess we'll just have
to be bad, won't we?</i>

930
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:35,277
<i>I'll have a Double Smiley sandwich,</i>

931
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,749
- <i>curly fries and a vanilla shake.</i>
- <i>Make that two.</i>

932
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,515
<i>That'll be 7.98.
Please drive up to the window. Thank you.</i>

933
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,832
I think we deserve a little junk food
after the workout we had this morning.

934
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:51,116
- Did you know that?
- Thank you. I'm flattered.

935
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,714
Smile! You're at Mr. Smiley's!

936
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,238
Would you like to try our new beef
and cheese pot pie on a stick?

937
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,675
Just $1.99 for a limited time only.

938
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:05,515
- We were just at a seminar. Buddy, this is my...
- <i>Her husband.</i>

939
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,909
We've met before, but something tells me...

940
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,275
you're going to remember me this time.

941
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,316
<i>Whoa!</i>

942
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:15,278
You are so busted.

943
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:17,316
This really doesn't concern you.

944
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:21,916
Well, actually, Janine is senior drive-thru manager,
so you are on her turf.

945
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:28,477
So, this makes sense.

946
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,915
- Oh, Lester...
- <i>Honey, it's okay.</i>

947
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,595
I want you to be happy.
Would you like Smiley Sauce with that?

948
01:24:34,680 --> 01:24:36,511
- Lester, just stop it!
- <i>No, no.</i>

949
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,591
You...

950
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:41,638
don't get to tell me what to do...

951
01:24:41,720 --> 01:24:43,995
ever again.

952
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:58,571
I'm sorry.

953
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:03,478
I guess we should cool it for a while.

954
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:08,472
I'm facing a potentially
very expensive divorce.

955
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:11,358
No, no, I understand completely.

956
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,670
It's...

957
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:18,754
"In order to be successful, one must project
an image of success at all times."

958
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,150
Stop it. Stop it.

959
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,116
<i>Oh, oh, whoa</i>

960
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,152
<i>There she stood in the street</i>

961
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:15,073
<i>Smiling from her head to her feet</i>

962
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:18,311
<i>I said
Hey, what is this</i>

963
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:20,436
<i>Now, baby, maybe</i>

964
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:23,193
<i>Maybe she's in need of a kiss</i>

965
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:26,431
- <i>I said, Hey, what's your name</i>
- Shit.

966
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,111
I have to run next door.

967
01:26:35,200 --> 01:26:39,113
Jane left her geometry book in my bag,
and she needs it to do her homework.

968
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:52,071
So you and psycho boy are fucking on,
like, a regular basis now, right?

969
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,071
No.

970
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:57,118
Come on. You can tell me.
Does he have a big dick?

971
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:01,432
I'm not going to talk about his dick
with you, okay? It's not like that.

972
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:04,717
Not like what? Doesn't he have one?

973
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,950
Why don't you want to talk about it?

974
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:10,271
- I tell you every detail about every guy that I fuck.
- Yeah.

975
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:14,990
Maybe you shouldn't, all right?
Maybe I really don't want to hear about all that.

976
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:18,629
So now that you have a boyfriend,
you're, like, above it?

977
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:22,554
We got to get you a real man.

978
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:45,116
- You got any papers?
- Yeah, in the cigar box right over there.

979
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:48,636
Put up a fight, dude. You are such a pushover.
"No, I can't, really. Okay."

980
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,870
You should learn to roll a joint.

981
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:54,470
<i>Oh! Hi.</i>

982
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:57,438
- <i>Where's Mom?</i>
- Don't know.

983
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:00,637
- Hi, Mr. Burnham.
- Hi.

984
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:04,952
Look at you.
Have you been working out?

985
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:06,600
Some.

986
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,195
You can really tell.

987
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:17,511
Look at those arms.

988
01:29:21,800 --> 01:29:23,916
You like... muscles?

989
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:30,150
I should probably go see
what Jane's up to.

990
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:42,990
<i>Where did you get that?</i>

991
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:47,838
- <i>From my job.</i>
- Don't lie to me.

992
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:53,193
Now, I saw you with him.

993
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,589
You were watching me?

994
01:29:56,720 --> 01:29:58,870
What does he make you do?

995
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:01,315
Oh.

996
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:04,039
Dad, you don't really think
me and Mr. Burnham...

997
01:30:04,120 --> 01:30:07,192
Don't you laugh at me!

998
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:11,990
I will not sit back and watch my only son
become a cock sucker!

999
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,911
Jesus, what is it with you?

1000
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:18,790
I swear to God...

1001
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,474
I'll throw you out of this house
and never look at you again!

1002
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:25,439
- You mean that.
- You're damn straight I do!

1003
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,274
I'd rather you were dead
than be a fuckin' faggot!

1004
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,150
You're right.

1005
01:30:45,360 --> 01:30:48,193
- I suck dick for money.
- Boy, don't start.

1006
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:51,989
- Two thousand dollars. I'm that good.
- Get out!

1007
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:56,358
You should see me fuck.
I'm the best piece of ass in three states.

1008
01:30:56,440 --> 01:31:00,069
Damn it, get out!
I don't ever want to see you again.

1009
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,594
What a sad... old man you are.

1010
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,631
Get out.

1011
01:31:37,480 --> 01:31:40,950
Mom... I'm leaving.

1012
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,110
Okay.

1013
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,591
Wear a raincoat.

1014
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:57,198
I wish things would have
been better for you.

1015
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:02,951
Take care of Dad.

1016
01:32:33,600 --> 01:32:36,034
<i>...disinvesting problems of power...</i>

1017
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:38,839
<i>and removing their ability
to make us afraid.</i>

1018
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:42,117
<i>This is the secret to "Me-Centered Living."</i>

1019
01:32:42,200 --> 01:32:44,794
<i>Only by taking full responsibility...</i>

1020
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,155
<i>for your actions and their solutions...</i>

1021
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:51,028
<i>will you ever break free
from the constant cycle of victimhood.</i>

1022
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:56,319
<i>You are only a victim if you choose
to be a victim. We all have the power...</i>

1023
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,914
<i>I don't think we can be friends any more!</i>

1024
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,831
<i>You're too uptight about sex.</i>

1025
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:04,117
Just don't fuck my dad, all right?

1026
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,236
- Please?
- Why not?

1027
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:09,596
Dad, leave us alone!

1028
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:12,035
<i>It's me.</i>

1029
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:15,271
- If I had to leave tonight, would you come with me?
- What?

1030
01:33:15,360 --> 01:33:18,796
If I had to go to New York to live,
tonight, would you come with me?

1031
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:22,356
Yes.

1032
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:26,718
<i>You guys can't be serious.
You're just a kid, and he's, like, a mental case.</i>

1033
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:30,554
- <i>You'll end up living in a box on the street.</i>
- I'm no more a kid than you are.

1034
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:33,712
- <i>We can use my plastic surgery money.</i>
- We won't have to.

1035
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:37,349
I have over $40,000. I know people in the city
that can help us get set up.

1036
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:40,477
- What, other drug dealers?
- Yes.

1037
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,438
- You'd be out of your mind to go with him.
- Why do you even care?

1038
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:46,398
- Because you're my friend.
- She's not your friend.

1039
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:48,630
She's someone you use
to feel better about yourself.

1040
01:33:48,720 --> 01:33:51,996
- Go fuck yourself, psycho!
- Hey, shut up, bitch!

1041
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:55,038
- Jane, he's a freak!
- Well, then so am I!

1042
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:58,317
We'll always be freaks,
and we'll never be like other people!

1043
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,949
And you'll never be a freak
'cause you're just... too perfect!

1044
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:06,158
Yeah, well, at least I'm not ugly.

1045
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,956
Yes, you are.

1046
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:13,430
And you're boring,
and you're totally ordinary,

1047
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,988
<i>and you know it.</i>

1048
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:20,350
You two deserve each other.

1049
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:20,869
Jesus, man, you're soaked.

1050
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:34,794
You want me to get Ricky?
He's in Jane's room.

1051
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:38,116
Are you okay?

1052
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:40,077
Where's your wife?

1053
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:43,551
Uh, I don't know.

1054
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:47,428
Probably out fucking that dorky Prince
of Real Estate asshole.

1055
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:51,188
And you know what?

1056
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:53,157
I don't care.

1057
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:05,918
Your wife is with another man, and...

1058
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:07,991
you don't care?

1059
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:12,469
Nope.

1060
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:15,199
Our marriage is just for show.

1061
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:18,317
A commercial for how normal we are...

1062
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:20,516
when we're anything but.

1063
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,910
Jesus, man, you are shaking.

1064
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,675
We really ought to get you out
of these clothes.

1065
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:36,479
Yeah.

1066
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,518
It's okay.

1067
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:44,957
I... am...

1068
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,918
You just tell me what you need.

1069
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,434
It's okay.

1070
01:37:08,160 --> 01:37:10,310
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1071
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:16,115
I'm sorry.

1072
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,589
Y-You got the wrong idea.

1073
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,389
<i>"I refuse to be a victim."</i>

1074
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,630
<i>When this becomes your mantra,</i>

1075
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:01,553
<i>constantly reinforcing your new non...</i>

1076
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:07,436
I refuse to be a victim!

1077
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,793
<i>Old man lying by the side of the road</i>

1078
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:45,589
<i>With the lorries rolling by</i>

1079
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:49,309
<i>Blue moon sinking
from the weight of the load</i>

1080
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:51,517
I hope you don't mind
if I play the stereo.

1081
01:38:52,600 --> 01:38:54,750
<i>Not at all.</i>

1082
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:57,400
Bad night?

1083
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:00,438
<i>Not really bad, just...</i>

1084
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:02,431
strange.

1085
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:07,036
<i>Believe me, it couldn't possibly
be any stranger than mine.</i>

1086
01:39:07,120 --> 01:39:10,590
<i>It's only castles burning</i>

1087
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:13,797
<i>Find someone who's turning</i>

1088
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:17,634
- <i>And you will come around</i>
- Jane and I had a fight.

1089
01:39:17,720 --> 01:39:19,756
It was about you.

1090
01:39:22,280 --> 01:39:25,272
<i>She's mad at me because...</i>

1091
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:27,555
I said I think you're sexy.

1092
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:31,551
Do you want a sip?

1093
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:34,108
Sure.

1094
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,280
<i>"Come on down to the river of sight</i>

1095
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:42,353
<i>And you can really understand"</i>

1096
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:45,113
<i>Red lights flashing through the window
in the rain</i>

1097
01:39:45,200 --> 01:39:48,749
<i>Can you hear the sirens moan</i>

1098
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:51,832
<i>White cane lying
in the gutter in the lane</i>

1099
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:54,559
<i>And you're walking home alone</i>

1100
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:57,393
<i>Don't let it bring you down</i>

1101
01:39:57,480 --> 01:40:00,597
<i>It's only castles burning</i>

1102
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:04,036
- <i>Find someone who's turning</i>
- So.

1103
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:07,192
- <i>And you will come around</i>
- You gonna tell me?

1104
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:12,954
What do you want?

1105
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:19,395
- I don't know.
- <i>Don't let it bring you down</i>

1106
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:23,837
- You... don't know?
- <i>It's only castles burning</i>

1107
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:27,230
- What do you want?
- <i>Find someone who's turning</i>

1108
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:30,198
- Are you kidding?
- <i>And you will come around</i>

1109
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:33,352
I want you.

1110
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:39,469
I've wanted you since
the first moment I saw you.

1111
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:45,190
You are the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

1112
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:49,159
<i>And the buildings scrape the sky</i>

1113
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:52,437
<i>Cold wind ripping
down the valley at dawn</i>

1114
01:40:52,520 --> 01:40:55,717
- You don't think I'm ordinary?
- <i>And the morning paper flies</i>

1115
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,438
<i>Dead man lying</i>

1116
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:01,274
- You couldn't be ordinary if you tried.
- <i>By the side of the road</i>

1117
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:03,510
<i>Don't let it bring you down</i>

1118
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:06,239
- Thank you.
- <i>It's only castles burning</i>

1119
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:10,711
- I don't think there's anything worse than being ordinary.
- <i>Find someone who's turning</i>

1120
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:13,189
<i>And you will come around</i>

1121
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,510
<i>Don't let it bring you down</i>

1122
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,591
<i>Don't let it bring you down</i>

1123
01:41:17,680 --> 01:41:20,353
<i>And you will come around</i>

1124
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:22,874
<i>Don't let it bring you down</i>

1125
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:25,758
<i>Don't let it bring you down</i>

1126
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:29,909
I refuse to be a victim.

1127
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,276
I refuse to be a victim.
I refuse to be a victim.

1128
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,351
Lester,

1129
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:38,113
I have something I have to say to you.

1130
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:28,157
Are you scared?

1131
01:42:28,240 --> 01:42:30,595
I don't get scared.

1132
01:42:33,120 --> 01:42:35,759
My parents will try to find me.

1133
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:38,752
Mine won't.

1134
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:00,993
This is my first time.

1135
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,436
You're kidding.

1136
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:07,431
I'm sorry.

1137
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,034
I still want to do it.

1138
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:13,271
I just... thought I should tell you...

1139
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,476
in case you wondered why I...

1140
01:43:15,560 --> 01:43:18,279
I wasn't... better.

1141
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:33,070
What's wrong?

1142
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:42,509
<i>I thought you said I was beautiful.</i>

1143
01:43:42,600 --> 01:43:44,556
You <i>are</i> beautiful.

1144
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:50,630
You are so... beautiful.

1145
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:56,195
And I would be a very...

1146
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:58,157
lucky man.

1147
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:01,954
I feel so stupid.

1148
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:04,429
Don't.

1149
01:44:04,520 --> 01:44:07,432
- Shh.
- I'm sorry.

1150
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:11,354
You have nothing to be sorry about.

1151
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:14,238
It's okay.

1152
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:17,471
Everything's okay.

1153
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:34,559
I was starving.

1154
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:38,952
- Do you want me to make you another one?
- No, no, no. I'm fine.

1155
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:41,270
You sure?

1156
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:46,150
I'm still a little weirded out,
but I feel better. Thanks.

1157
01:44:49,480 --> 01:44:53,029
- How's Jane?
- What do you mean?

1158
01:44:54,480 --> 01:44:56,835
I mean,

1159
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:59,195
how's her life?

1160
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:01,316
Is she happy?

1161
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:04,437
Is she miserable?

1162
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:08,877
I'd really like to know, and she'd die
before she'd ever tell me about it.

1163
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:14,237
She's, uh...

1164
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:17,232
She's really happy.

1165
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:19,710
She thinks she's in love.

1166
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,151
Good for her.

1167
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:37,751
How are you?

1168
01:45:45,400 --> 01:45:48,710
It's been a long time
since anybody asked me that.

1169
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:57,474
I'm great.

1170
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:05,838
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

1171
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,310
I'm great.

1172
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:56,158
Man, oh man.

1173
01:46:57,960 --> 01:47:00,679
Man, oh man, oh man.

1174
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:36,835
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1175
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:23,239
<i>I had always heard
your entire life flashes...

1176
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:27,029
<i>in front of your eyes
the second before you die.</i>

1177
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:29,759
<i>First of all, that one second...</i>

1178
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:32,479
<i>isn't a second at all.</i>

1179
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,551
<i>It stretches on forever,</i>

1180
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:37,359
<i>like an ocean of time.</i>

1181
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:42,118
<i>For me, it was lying on my back...</i>

1182
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:45,909
<i>at Boy Scout camp,
watching falling stars.</i>

1183
01:48:53,960 --> 01:48:57,077
<i>And yellow leaves from the maple trees...</i>

1184
01:48:57,160 --> 01:48:59,469
<i>that lined our street.</i>

1185
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:11,037
<i>Or my grandmother's hands
and the way her skin...</i>

1186
01:49:11,120 --> 01:49:13,350
<i>seemed like paper.</i>

1187
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:23,915
<i>And the first time
I saw my cousin Tony's...</i>

1188
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,833
<i>brand-new Firebird.</i>

1189
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:40,071
<i>And Janie.</i>

1190
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:43,271
<i>And Janie.</i>

1191
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:16,235
<i>And... Carolyn.</i>

1192
01:50:21,040 --> 01:50:24,635
<i>I guess I could be pretty pissed off
about what happened to me,</i>

1193
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:29,999
<i>but it's hard to stay mad
when there's so much beauty in the world.</i>

1194
01:50:30,080 --> 01:50:35,029
<i>Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it
all at once and it's too much.</i>

1195
01:50:35,120 --> 01:50:39,989
<i>My heart fills up like a balloon
that's about to burst.</i>

1196
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:43,993
<i>And then I remember to relax...</i>

1197
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:47,038
<i>and stop trying to hold on to it.</i>

1198
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:50,556
<i>And then it flows through me like rain,</i>

1199
01:50:50,640 --> 01:50:54,155
<i>and I can't feel anything but gratitude...</i>

1200
01:50:54,240 --> 01:50:56,310
<i>for every single moment...</i>

1201
01:50:56,400 --> 01:51:00,154
<i>of my stupid little life.</i>

1202
01:51:00,240 --> 01:51:03,516
<i>You have no idea
what I'm talking about, I'm sure.</i>

1203
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,511
<i>But don't worry.</i>

1204
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,790
<i>You will someday.</i>

1205
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:23,111
<i>Because the world is round</i>

1206
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:28,957
<i>It turns me on</i>

1207
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:33,158
<i>Because</i>

1208
01:51:33,240 --> 01:51:35,834
<i>The world</i>

1209
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:40,550
<i>Is round</i>

1210
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:51,911
<i>Because the wind is high</i>

1211
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:57,597
<i>It blows my mind</i>

1212
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:01,919
<i>Because</i>

1213
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:04,389
<i>The wind</i>

1214
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:09,031
<i>Is high</i>

1215
01:52:14,640 --> 01:52:17,438
<i>Love is old, Love is new</i>

1216
01:52:20,280 --> 01:52:23,033
<i>Love is all, Love is you</i>

1217
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:31,991
<i>Because the sky is blue</i>

1218
01:52:32,080 --> 01:52:37,712
<i>It makes me cry</i>

1219
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:41,918
<i>Because</i>

1220
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,468
<i>The sky</i>

1221
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:49,076
<i>Is blue</i>
