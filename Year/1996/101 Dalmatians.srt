00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,240
[Barking]

00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,520
[Barking]

3
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,400
[Clock Chiming]

4
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,200
My story begins
in London...

5
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,960
not so very long ago.

6
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,120
Yet so much has happened since then,
that it seems like an eternity.

7
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,040
At that time,
lived with my pet...

8
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,960
- in a bachelor flat
just off Regents Park.
-#[Piano]

9
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,400
It was a
beautiful spring day,

10
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,800
a tedious time of the year
for bachelors.

11
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,880
Oh... that's my pet,
Roger Radclif,

12
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,800
a musician of sorts.

13
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,880
I'm the one
with the spots.

14
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,120
My name's Pongo.

15
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,840
As far as I could see,

16
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,000
the old notion that
a bachelor's life wasso...

17
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,760
glamorous and carefree
was all nonsense.

18
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,440
It was downright dull.

19
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,480
[Sigh]

20
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,280
It was plain to see that
my old pet needed someone.

21
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:11,280
But if it were left up to Roger,
we'd be bachelors forever.

22
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,280
He was married to his work,
writing songs.

23
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,280
Songs about romance...
of all things,

24
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,480
something he knew
absolutely nothing about.

25
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,440
Oh, he's intelligent enough,
as humans go.

26
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,640
And I think you could say, Roger is
a rather handsome animal in his way.

27
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,360
I could see no reason
why my pet...

28
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,760
didn't deserve
an attractive mate.

29
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,440
At least I was determined
to do my best.

30
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,760
Of course, dogs are a pretty
poor judge of human beauty.

31
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,800
But I had
a rough idea...

32
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,520
of what
to look for.

33
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,120
Hmm!
Unusual breed.

34
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,800
[Chuckle]
Very unusual.

35
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,000
Hmm!
Oh, surely not.

36
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,240
Well now,
what have we here?

37
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,640
Hmm.

38
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,120
Well, a little...
too short coupled.

39
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,080
Nope!

40
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:21,400
I say!
Well, I do say!

41
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,880
Now there's
a fancy breed.

42
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,480
Hmm.
Perhaps a little too fancy.

43
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,800
Yes, much too fancy.

44
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,640
Too old.
Too young.

45
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,560
It was a problem,
a real problem.

46
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,880
Well, now that's
a bit more like it!

47
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,160
The most beautiful creature
on four legs!

48
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,920
Now if only the girl--

49
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,120
Well!
She's very lovely too.

50
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,040
It was almost too good
to be true.

51
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:03,560
I'd never find another pair
like that,

52
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,480
not if looked
for 100 years.

53
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,240
Ah, they're heading
for the park.

54
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,120
A perfect meeting place...
if I can only arrange it.

55
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,520
Uh-oh... but Roger never
stopped work' till after 5:00.

56
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,520
That would be
too late.

57
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,920
[Barking]

58
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,640
After 5:00 already.

59
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,080
- Fancy that.
- [Barking]

60
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,600
All right, Pongo.
All right, boy.

61
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,080
[Barking]

62
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,760
[Yipping]

63
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,200
Pongo, boy,
take it easy!

64
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,840
What's all
the hurry?

65
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,680
[Barking]

66
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,640
[Barking]

67
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,240
Pongo, boy,
slow down.

68
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,240
I was afraid we'd missed them.
Perhaps they passed on by the park.

69
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,360
Then suddenly...
I spotted them.

70
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,720
It was a perfect situation
if I planned it right.

71
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,760
I couldn't depend on Roger.
I knew what he'd do.

72
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,600
He'd settle on the grass, puff
his pipe and that would be it.

73
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,480
No, it was all
up to me.

74
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,080
Well.

75
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,120
At first I had
no particular plan,

76
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,360
just anything
to attract attention.

77
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,200
You know,
stir things up a bit.

78
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,560
Pongo,
you silly old thing!

79
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,280
C'mon!
C'mon, let's have it, boy.

80
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,440
- Pongo!
- [Yipping]

81
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,520
Pongo!

82
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,520
[Barking]

83
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,480
[Pongo] For a while,
it seemed to work.

84
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,360
At least they
had seen one another.

85
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,120
Things were going along
first-rate.

86
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,360
But for some strange reason
they left!

87
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,920
C'mon, you old renegade.
We're going home.

88
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,640
[Pongo]
But I wasn't giving up.

89
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,120
I was determined that somehow
they just had to meet.

90
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,120
- Oh!
- Ohhh!

91
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,920
I beg your pardon.
Please excuse me.

92
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,560
I must say,
what on earth!

93
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,520
- Oh, really. Good heavens.
- Oh, dear.

94
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,280
- Ohh!
-Ahh, ahh!

95
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,040
Oh, oh.

96
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,640
[Gasping]

97
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,080
Oh, my new spring suit
and my new hat!

98
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,880
[Roger] Ah, ah...
I'm terribly sorry.

99
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,000
Please let me
help you.

100
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,560
I'm so sorry.

101
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,200
I don't know
what's come over him.

102
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,360
I'm so sorry. He's never
acted this way before.

103
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,640
Please, just go away.
You've done enough.

104
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,560
Please?
Oh.

105
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,280
Oh, I say.
Here, take mine.

106
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,680
Oh.

107
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,360
[Laughing]

108
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,120
Wilt thou lo ve her,
comfort her,

109
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,520
honour and keep her
in sickness and in health;

110
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,840
and for asking
all others,

111
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,480
keep thee only unto her
so long as ye both shall live?

112
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,720
[Roger]
I will.

113
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,920
[Pongo] For the first
six months orso...

114
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,560
we lived in a small house
near the park,

115
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,600
a modest little place...

116
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:55,400
but just right for two couples
who were just starting out.

117
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,640
#[Piano]

118
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,200
Perdita, darling,
are you all right?

119
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,080
[Chuckle]
Oh, of course, dear.

120
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,200
After all, dogs were having
puppies long before our time.

121
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,880
[Chuckle]

122
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,680
[Pongo] Oh, that's Nanny,
a wonderful cook and housekeeper.

123
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:22,560
She's such a kind,
understanding soul.

124
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,280
You know,

125
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,800
at times she seems
almost canine.

126
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,640
Roger, dear,

127
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,200
tea time.

128
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,920
Tea time!

129
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,640
[Roger]
#Be down in a minute#

130
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,080
#Ta tum ti ta tum#

00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,440
#Do you like my new song#

132
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,280
#Ta tum ti ta tum#
Such clever lyrics.

133
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,200
[Chuckle]
Melody first, my dear.

134
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,840
And then the lyrics,
hmm?

135
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,120
[Car Horn]

136
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,080
Oh, Pongo... it's her.
It's that devil woman.

137

138
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,280
[Roger] Oh, must be Cruela, your
dearly devoted old school mate.

139
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,240
Cruela de Vil.

140
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
That's it!

#Cruela de Vil#

142

#If she doesn't scare you
no evil thing will#

- Oh, Roger.
-#To see her is to take
a sudden chill#

145
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,680
Ohh!

146

#Cruela... Cruela#

147
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,720
#She's like a spider
waiting for the... kill#

148
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,080
Roger,
she'll hear you.

#Look out for
Cruela de Vil#

150
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,320
Let her in, Nanny.

151
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,200
- Anita, darling!
- How are you?

152
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,080
Miserable as usual.
Perfectly wretched!

153
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,840
Where are they?
Where are they?

154
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,440
For heaven sakes,
where are they?

155
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,200
- Who, Cruela?
- The puppies! The puppies.

156
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,680
No time for games.
Where are the little brutes?

#[Trumpet]

158
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,440
It'll be at least three weeks.
No rushing these things.

159
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,480
[Chuckle]
Anita, you're such a wit.

160
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,360
Here, dog, here.

161
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,440
- Here, dog.
- [Growling]

162
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,520
Cruela, isn't that
a new fur coat?

163
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,360
My only true love,
darling.

164
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:48,200
I live for furs.
I worship furs!

165
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,880
Is there a woman in this
wretched world who doesn't?

166
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,840
Oh, I'd like a nice fur,
but there are many other thing--

167
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,960
Sweet, simple Anita.
[Chuckle]

168
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,520
I know, I know!

169
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,960
This horrid little house
is your dream castle.

170
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,400
And poor Roger is your
bold and fearless Sir Galahad!

171

Oh, Cruela.

172
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,040
Then of course you have
your little spotted friends.

173
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,280
Oh yes,

174
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,320
I must say... such perfectly
beautiful coats.

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,520
- Won't you have some tea?
- I've got to run.

176
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,440
Let me know when
the puppies arrive.

177
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,720
- You will, won't you, dear?
- Yes, Cruela.

178
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:43,000
Don't forget, it's a promise.
See you in three weeks.

179
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,360
Cheerio, darling.

180
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,680
Ohh!

181
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:53,320
#At first you think
Cruela is a devil#

182
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,280
#But after time
has worn away the shock#

183
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,360
#You come
to realize#

184
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,680
#You've seen
her kind of eyes#

185
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,560
#Watching you from
underneath a rock#

186
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,640
- You're no help.
-#This vampire bat#

187
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,760
#This inhuman beast#

188
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,480
#She ought to be locked up
and never released#

189
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,360
#The world was such
a wholesome place until#

190
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,520
#Cruela#

191
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,480
#Cruela de Vil#

192
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,640
Roger,
you are an idiot!

193
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,160
[Laughter]

194
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,800
- Perdy?
- That witch. That devil woman.

195
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,280
She wants our puppies.
That's all she's after.

196
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,680
Don't worry, Perdy.
They're on to her.

197
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,840
- Nothing's going to happen
to our puppies.
- What does she want with them?

198
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,440
She can't possibly
lo ve them.

199
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,040
Oh, Pongo.

200
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,480
I was so happy at first,
but now I--

201
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,480
[Crying]

202
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,880
Oh, I--

203
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,600
I wish we weren't
having any.

204
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,280
[Thunder]

205
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:14,000
[Pongo] Poor Perdita.
Of course, she had no choice.

206
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,960
The puppies arrived
right on schedule...

207
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,800
one wild and stormy night
in October.

208
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,600
[Footsteps]

209
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,280
Ohh!

210
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,000
Steady, boy.

211
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,440
[Nanny]
The puppies are here!

212
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,720
Oh... the puppies
are here!

213
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,360
H-H-How many?

214
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,520
- Eight.
- Eight?

215
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,800
[Barking]

216
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,600
By George, Pongo!
Eight puppies.

217
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,880
Ten.

218
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,160
- [Anita] Eleven.
- Eleven.

219
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:21,640
Eleven?
Eleven puppies, Pongo.

220
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,760
Wait a minute now,
wait a minute... thirteen!

221
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,400
No, no, no.
Fourteen.

222
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,000
- Ohh... fifteen!
- Fifteen?

223
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,360
And the mother's
doing fine, love.

224
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,520
You ducky thing, you.

225
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,240
Fifteen puppies?

226
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,160
Why, Pongo,
that's marvelous!

227
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,440
It's fabulous!

228
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,320
Why, you old rascal!

229
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,240
Fourteen.

230
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,960
Just fourteen.

231
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,080
We lost one.

232
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,360
Poor little thing.

233
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,760
Oh, Pongo, boy.

234
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,800
It's just one
of those things.

235
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,800
And yet?

236
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,360
And yet I wonder.

237
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,920
[Thunder]

238
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,520
Look, Pongo.

239
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,760
Anita!

240
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,360
Nanny.
Fifteen!

241
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,320
We still have
fifteen!

242
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,840
Oh, Roger, he's all right!
Thank heaven.

243
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,560
See? He's just
as good as new.

244
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,840
Can you imagine, Roger,
fifteen puppies!

245
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,040
Fifteen.
Fifteen puppies!

246
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,160
How marvelous.

247
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,760
How marvelous,
how perfectly... ugh!

248
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,640
The devil take it.
They're mongrels... no spots!

249
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,640
No spots at all.
What a horrid little white rat.

250
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,600
They're not mongrels!

251
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,840
They'll get their spots.
Just wait and see.

252
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,160
That's right. They'll have
their spots in a few weeks.

253
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,720
Oh, we, in that case I'll
take them all. The whole litter.

254
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,840
Just name your price, dear.

255
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,320
I'm afraid
we can't give them up.

256
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,120
- Poor Perdita, she'd be heartbroken.
- Anita, don't be ridiculous.

257
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,080
You can't afford to keep them.
You can scarcely feed yourselves.

258
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,280
I'm sure
we'll get along.

259
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,320
[Chuckle]
Yes, I know. I know!

260
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,520
Roger's...
Roger's songs!

261
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,520
[Laughing]

262
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,360
Enough of this nonsense. I'll pay you
twice what they're worth.

263
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,440
I'm being
more than generous.

264
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,480
Blast this pen.

265
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,880
Blast this wretched,
wretched pen!

266
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,160
When can the puppies
leave their mother?

267
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,440
Two weeks?
Three weeks?

268
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,960
[Roger] Never.

269
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,320
- What?
- We're n-n-not sealing the puppies.

270
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,520
Not a single one.
Do you understand?

271
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,080
Anita, is he serious?

272
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,560
I really
don't know Roger.

273
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,400
- Cruela, he--
- Surely he must be joking!

274
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,640
No, no, no.
I-I-I mean it.

275
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,680
You're not getting one.
N-N-Not one.

276
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,400
And that's... final.

277
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,120
Why, you horrid man!

278
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,720
You... you...

279
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:53,000
All right, keep the little
beasts for all I care.

280
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,280
Do as you like with them.
Drown them!

281
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,240
But I warn you, Anita,
I'm through with all of you!

282
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,360
I'll get even.
Just wait.

283
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,280
You'll be sorry,
you fools!

284
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,360
You... you idiots!

285
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,400
[Door Slams]

286
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:11,600
[Barking]

287
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,600
Oh, Roger!
You were magnificent, darling.

288
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,880
He was a blooming' hero,
ma'am!

289
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,760
Indeed he was.
A bloomin' hero!

290
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,280
Perdy?
Perdy, darling?

291
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,040
We're keeping the puppies,
every single one of them.

292
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,440
My ol'pet Roger, he told
that devil woman off.

293
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,840
He told her of, Perdy.
She's gone.

294
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,760
- Darling, she's gone for good.
- Oh, Pongo.

295
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,520
- C'mon, Thunderbolt.
- C'mon, Thunderbolt.

296
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,640
Go get him, Thunder.

297
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,760
After him, boy.

298
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,120
He'll get that
dirty ol' horse thief.

299
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,480
Old Thunderbolt's the greatest
dog in the whole world.

300
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,560
He's even better
than Dad.

301
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,560
No dog's better
than Dad.

302
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,640
What's he going to do,
Dad?

303
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,640
Shh, shh.
Let's just wait and see.

304
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,600
[Puppy] Look at him run,
the old coward.

305
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,560
That old dirty Dawson!

306
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,600
The yellow-livered
old skunk!

307
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,400
I'd like to tear
his gizzard out.

308
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,600
[Perdy] Why, Patch, where did
you ever hear such talk?

309
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,840
Certainly not
from your mother.

310
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,720
- Watch out, Thunder.
- Don't worry, Penny.

311
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,520
He'll get that
yellow-livered--

312
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,320
Well, he'll get him,
all right.

313
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,200
Lucky, get down.
We can't see.

314
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,800
Mother,
make him get down.

315
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,720
C'mon, Lucky.
Down, dear.

316
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,640
Missed him.
Missed him by a mile.

317
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,040
I'm hungry, mother.
I'm hungry.

318
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,280
Roly, you've just had
your dinner.

319
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,200
But I am,
just the same.

320
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,320
I'm so hungry I could eat...
a whole elephant.

321
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,360
Shh!

322
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,880
[Puppy] There he is,
behind that rock.

323
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,360
[Gunshot]

324
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,640
Oh, dear.
He shot poor Thunder.

325
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,280
He missed him. Ol' Thunder's
pretending... I think.

326
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,320
[Wicked Laugh]

327
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,640
See? What did I tell you?
That's one of his tricks.

328
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,920
- Lucky, get down.
- Ha-ha-ha!

329
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,400
[Whimpering, Yipping]

330
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,240
I'm hungry, Mother.
I really am.

331
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,640
[TV] Don't miss next week's episode.
Who will triumph?

332
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,640
Ol' Thunder
always wins!

333
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,480
And speaking of champions,
friends,

334
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,920
Kanine Krunchies is the
champion of all dog biscuits.

335
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,960
#Kanine Krunchies
can't be beat#

336
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,880
#They make each meal
a special treat#

337
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,400
#Happy dogs are those who eat
nutritious Kanine Krunchies#

338
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,480
Perdy, we better get these
little nippers of to bed...

339
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,440
if we're going for a...
w-a-l-k.

340
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,080
- We want to go too, Mother.
- Can we, Mother?

341
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,360
We never
get to go.

342
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,520
Come along, children.
Bedtime.

343
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:57,680
But we're not a...
[Yawn]... bit sleepy.

344
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,520
We want to go
for a walk in the park.

345
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,480
- Dad, can we?
- Better do as your mother says.

346
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,840
[Pongo] One, two,
three, four...

347
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,000
five, six...

520
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,720
[Distant Barking]

521
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,680
[Barking]

522
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,040
[Howling]

523
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,120
[Barking]

524
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,360
[Barking]

525
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,720
Towser,
what's going on?

526
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,120
What is it?
What's all the gossip?

527
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,600
'Taint no gossip, Lucy.
It be all the way from London.

528
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,080
- You don't say!
- 1 5 puppies stolen.

529
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,560
There's no puppies around here,
not since Nelie's last litter.

530
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,800
Well, then, we'd best
send the word along.

531
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,720
It be up to me
to reach the Colonel!

532
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,200
He be the only one
in barking range.

533
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,480
You'll never reach him
at this hour!

534
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,440
Well, I can try!

535
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,960
I'll bark all night
if I have to.

536
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,160
Ahem!

537
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,120
[Barking]

538
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,400
[Distant Barking]

539
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,880
Hmm-hmm-hmm.

540
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,480
Hmm... sounds like
old Towser.

541
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:34,120
It's an alert.
Sergeant!

542
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,960
Sergeant Tibs!
I say, Sergeant!

543
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,080
[Neighing]

544
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,400
Oh, yes, Captain!

545
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,640
Barking signal. It's an alert.
Report to the Colonel at once.

546
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,920
Right to, sir.
Right away, sir!

547
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,200
Colonel?

548
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:56,080
I say, Colonel!
Colonel, sir?

549
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,920
- Colonel?
- What? Who goes there?

550
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,360
Sergeant Tibs
reporting, sir.

551
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,360
Tibs? Tibs?
Oh, yes, Sergeant Tibs!

552
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,200
Look here, Tibs. What's the idea
of barging in at this hour?

553
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,480
But Colonel--

554
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,240
- Hold on, Sergeant. You hear that?
- [Barking]

555
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,160
- Sounds like an alert.
- Yes, Colonel.

556
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,480
- We'd better look into it.
Come along, on the double.
- Righto, sir.

557
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,800
- It's old Towser down
at Withermarsh, sir.
- [Barking]

558
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,520
By Jove, yes!
So it is.

559
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,800
Well, I'll see
what he wants.

560
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,720
Ahem!

561
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,280
Woof, woof, woof!

562
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,600
Woof, woof, woof!

563
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,320
It be the Colonel.
The old boy himself!

564
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,360
He wants the message.

565
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,880
You'd better make it loud
or he'll never get it.

566
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,800
[Barking]

567
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,400
One long howl,
two short.

568
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,840
- One yip and a woof.
- Two yips, sir.

569
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,840
- What's the word?
- It's from London.

570
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,720
- It must be important.
- Yes, I'll get the rest of it.

571
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,160
Ahem!

572
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:13,600
Woof, woof, woof!

573
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,320
[Distant Barking]

574
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,760
Sounds like a number.
Three fives is 1 3.

575
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:28,600
- That's 1 5, sir.
- Of course, 1 5.

576
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,200
[Barking]

577
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,480
Yes... Dot, Spot--
Spotted puddings.

578
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,040
Poodles.

579
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,840
- No, puddles!
- Puddles, sir?

580
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,640
1 5 spotted puddles stolen?
Oh, balderdash!

581
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,120
- Better double-check it, Colonel.
- [Grumbling]

582
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,840
Oh, yes,
I suppose I'd better.

583
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,080
Woof, woof, woof!

584
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,240
[Barking]

585
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,760
Two woofs,
one yip and a woof.

586
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,320
- It sounds like "puppies"!
- Of course, puppies!

587
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,240
I just remembered.

588
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,120
Two nights past, I heard
puppy barking at Hel Hal.

589
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,840
The old de Vil place?
Nonsense, Tibs!

590
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,240
No one's lived there
for years.

591
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,440
Hold on! There's smoke
coming from the chimney!

592
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,720
[Colonel] ByJo ve, that's strange...
strange indeed.

593
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,200
I suppose
we'd better investigate.

594
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,680
I'll send word for
ol' Towser to stand by.

595
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,520
Roof! Roo-roo-roof!

596
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,400
Please... stand... by.

597
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,560
- What's he mean by that?
- I don't know.

598
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,800
Oh... maybe the ol' boy's
found something!

599
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,600
Oh, I do hope so.

600
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,520
They say the ol' place is haunted or
bewitched or some such fiddle faddle.

601
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,520
Fiddle faddle
and rot, sir.

602
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:01,240
Just the same, Sergeant,
use extreme caution.

603
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,680
No teling what sort of
hocus pocus you might run into.

604
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,880
[Gulps]

605
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,080
Blast it all, Tibs.
On the double, man.

606
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,120
- On the double.
- Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

607
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,920
Psst!

608
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:54,360
- [Whispering] Rover! Spotty!
- Hmm. What?

609
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,320
Are you one of
the 1 5 stolen puppies?

610
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,480
We're not stolen.
We're bought and paid for.

611
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,480
There's 99 of us
all together.

612
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,640
Ninety-nine!

613
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,120
How'bout that bunch
of little ones?

614
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,440
They have names and colours.
They're not from the pet shops.

615
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,360
- Fifteen of'em.
- We never counted them.

616
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,960
They're over there
by the tv.

617
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,560
- I'd better count'em.
- Watch out for the baduns.

618
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,840
Baduns?

619
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,360
Those two blokes,
Horace and Jasper.

620
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:35,560
They're mean ones,
they are.

621
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,200
#[TV]

622
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,240
Hey, look, Horace!

623
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,680
Watch me pot His Lordship
smack on the conk.

624
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,120
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
How's that for calin'em, eh?

625
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,320
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

626
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,520
[Whispering]
One... two...

627
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,040
- three, four, five, six--
- Hey, Jasper.

628
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,880
[Mumbling]
Give us a swig,

629
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,520
- just a short one.
- Now, Horace,

630
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:11,280
this hogwash ain't fit
for a fancy bloke like yourself.

631
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,600
Besides, you'd get crumbs in it,
you cabbage head!

632
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,320
All right.

633
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:21,920
Guzzle the whole works. I hope it
gives you coly wobbles, that's what.

634
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,480
Hey, Jasper.
Did you--

635
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,520
Six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, eleven--

636
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:39,520
Hey, get down, you runt!
And stay down!

637
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,880
[Yipping]

638
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,800
Go on, get out of here...

639
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,720
orl'l black
your other peeper.

640
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,920
Where was I?
Nine--

641
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,720
Nine... three more.

642
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:55,640
Twelve and... one, two, three.
That's fifteen!

643
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,520
They're the ones!

644
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,360
- [Screeching]
- Blimey!

645
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,280
- [Barking]
- What the--

646
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,840
Horace, look what we got!
A tabby cat!

647
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,080
[Yipping]

648
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:13,440
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!

649
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,600
How'd you like
a tabby cat stew?

650
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,760
Or a cat casserole?

651
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,080
A la mode!

652
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,840
[Howling]

653
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,560
[Chiming]

654
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:36,360
[Hooligans]

655
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,800
- What is it, Pongo? What is it?
- It's the Great Dane.

656
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,000
He has news forus.
He'll meet us at Primrose Hil.

657
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:54,280
- How'll we get out?
- The back bedroom window.

658
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,560
It's always open
a wee bit. C'mon.

659
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,920
- Woof! Woof!
- [Barking]

660
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,800
Pongos, you've made it.
Good.

661
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,320
- What's the word? What's the news?
- Have they found our puppies?

662
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,040
They've been located
somewhere north of here...

663
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,200
- in Suffolk.
- Oh, thank heaven.

664
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,200
- Can you leave tonight?
- We can leave right away.

665
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,680
I'll go along as far as Camden Road
and give you instructions.

666
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,120
[Great Dane] When you reach
Wither marsh, contact old To wser.

667
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,600
He'll direct you to the Colonel
and the Colonel will take you...

668
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,520
toy our puppies
at the de Vilplace.

669
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,360
- De Vil!
- The de Vil place!

670
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,240
Oh, Pongo,
it was her!

671
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,080
- Oh, someone you know?
- There's no time to explain.

672
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,200
I hope we're
not too late.

673
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,720
Good luck, Pongo.

674
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,400
If you lose your way,
contact the barking chain.

675
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,040
They'll be
standing by!

676
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,440
[Honking]

677
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,400
Any news, Colonel?

678
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,400
Not a blasted thing.

679
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,520
They're lost or captured,
or something or other.

680
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,160
- Who knows what.
- Colonel, here comes a car.

681
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,440
Come now, Tibs.
Don't be ridiculous.

682
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,960
- They wouldn't be driving.
- Yes, I know, sir.

683
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:29,080
But it's heading
for Hel Hal.

684
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,720
It-- It's stopping
at the gate!

685
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,240
It is?

686
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,760
Blast it all!
Better see what's up.

687
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,480
- On the double, man. On the double!
- Yes, sir.

688
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,880
Take over, Captain.

689
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,880
Right to, sir.

690
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,120
[TVQuiz Master] I'm sorry,
Mr Simpkins. The answers no, no, no.

691
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,480
Six down, four to go.

692
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:58,680
I've got no time to argue.
It's got to be done tonight.

693
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,200
It must be a yes
or no question.

694
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,440
Do you understand?
Tonight!

695
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,360
[Horace]
But they ain't big enough.

696
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,360
You couldn't get half a dozen coats
out of the whole caboodle.

697
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,520
Coats!
Dog-skin coats?

698
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,960
We'll settle for half a dozen!
We can't wait.

699
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:17,800
The police are everywhere.
I want the job done tonight!

700
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,840
How're we gonna do it?

701
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,560
Any way you like.
Poison them, drown them.

702
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,480
Bash them in the head.
You got any chloroform?

703
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,080
- Not a drop.
- And no ether, "ee-there."

704
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,640
" Eye-there"!

705
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,160
I don't care how you kill the little
beasts, but do it... and do it now!

706
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,040
A we, please, miss.
Ha ve pity.

707
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,160
Can't we see the rest
of the show first?

708
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:43,000
[Horace] We want to see
"What's My Crime?"

709
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,800
[Explosion]

710
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,280
Listen, you idiots!

711
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,520
I'll be back in the morning.
The job better be done...

712
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,920
or I'll--
I'll call the police!

713
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,120
Do you understand?

714
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,320
I think she means it.

715
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,080
Ah...
We'll get on with it...

716
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,080
as soon as
the show's over.

717
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,280
Will you please
sign in, sir?

718
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,760
You'd better get out of here
if you want to save your skins.

719
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,680
- But how?
- Shh.

720
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,400
There's a hole in the wall
there by the door.

721
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,680
C'mon, shake a leg.

722
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,800
Psst.
Kids, follow me.

723
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,080
[Horace] Hey, Jasper, look!
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

724
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,040
It's old Meathead.

725
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:45,160
Yeah, what do you know...
old Meathead Faunce water.

726
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,440
C'mon,
don't crowd.

727
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,000
One at a time.
One at a time!

728
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,480
For our last contestant,

729
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,800
meet Mr PercivaI Faunce water.

730
00:48:55,960 --> 00:49:01,240
If the panel fails to guess your
unusual crime in ten questions,

731
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,160
you will receive two weeks vacation
at a seaside resort,

732
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,760
all expenses paid.

733
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,920
[Quiz Master] That is, after
you've paid your debt to society.

734
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,880
Who will take the first
question? inspector?

735
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,120
Could your crime
be classified as larceny?

736
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,640
-A theft, burglary?
- Straighten out!

737
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,200
Form a queue... along the wall.
Snap it up.

738
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,760
[Quiz Master] Mr Faunce water
is a burglar by trade,

739
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,080
but in this case,
his crime was not burglary.

740
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,120
- The answers no.
- [Laughing]

741
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,320
One down, nine to go.
Miss Birdwel?

742
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,400
If your crime
wasn't robbery, did you--

743
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,400
Oh, dear,
what I mean is--

744
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,120
Do something of
a violent nature, that is--

745
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,520
Come, Miss Birdwel,
we're running short of time.

746
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,440
[Miss Birdwel] So sorry.

747
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,320
- Did you do someone in?
- Oh!

748
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,520
[Quiz Master] I'm sorry.
The answers no.

749
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,600
Two down,
eight to go.

750
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,880
- Mr Simpkins?
- Psst.

751
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,920
Hey, kid, let's go.

752
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:05,400
[Mr Simpkins] Could it be
a violation of a city ordinance?

753
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,880
No.

754
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,840
Hey, get out of the way,
you little runt!

755
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,880
[Quiz Master] Three down,
seven to go. Inspector?

756
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:16,440
[Inspector] Very confusing,
I must say.

757
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,840
Surely,
this crime could--

758
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
- [Buzzer]
- I'm terribly sorry.

759
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:25,840
-We've run out of time.
-[Horace] Ain't that always the way!

760
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,760
Would it be possible for
Mr Faunce water to come back next week?

761
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,960
Then we could finish
our little game.

762
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:36,040
Goodnight, audience.
See you next week at this same time...

763
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,480
on "What's My Crime?"

764
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,000
Ah, oh well.

765
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,440
C'mon, Horace.
Let's get on with it.

766
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:48,840
I'll pop'em on the head,
you do the skinnin'.

767
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:50,760
No you don't, Jasper!

768
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,280
I'll pop'em of and
you do the skinnin'.

769
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,120
Horace, look!

770
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,480
They're gone.
They flew the coop...

771
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:04,720
right out through this hole.
Here, grab a torch.

772
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,000
We'll run'em down before
you can say " Bob's your uncle."

773
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,080
[Whimpering]

774
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:17,320
There they go, Horace,
up the stairs.

775
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,160
[Whistling]

776
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,280
Here puppies.

777
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,840
[Whistling]

778
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,560
Here, puppies!
C'mon now.

779
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,840
Don't go hiding from
ol' Uncle Jasper.

780
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,320
I ain't gonna hurt ya.

781
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,520
I thought we was
gonna pop'em of.

782
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,800
Shut up.
Take a squint in there.

783
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,400
I'll check these
other two rooms.

784
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:47,320
[Whistling]
Here, puppies.

785
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,680
Come on out.
Come out wherever you are.

786
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,600
[Screeching]

787
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,480
Horace! Oh!

788
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,320
[Jasper] It's that mangy tabby cat.
He's the ringleader.

789
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,160
Head'em off.
Head'em--

790
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,680
[Yipping]

791
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,920
You bungling blockhead!

792
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,840
Back here!
Back here!

793
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:14,680
Shh.
Here they come.

794
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,600
Double-crossin' little twerps,
puling a snitch on us!

795
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,720
After we took care of'em.
There's gratitude for you.

796
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:24,280
It ain't fair, Jasper.

797
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:28,120
- [Whining]
- Horace, there they go!

798
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,160
Sergeant?
I say, Sergeant.

799
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,960
No time to explain.
Busy, sir.

800
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,680
Shut that door!

801
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,920
We'll close in on'em.
Enough of this " Ring Around the Rosy."

802
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,280
Oh, Pongo,
I'm afraid we're lost.

803
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,200
It can't be far.
[Barking]

804
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,080
By Jove!
It can't be the Pongos.

805
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,800
[Barking]

806
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,080
Grrr...
[Howling]

807
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,840
It's the Colonel.
This way.

808
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:24,160
[Barking And Howling]

809
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,840
Colonel?
Are you the Colonel?

810
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,600
Oh, Pingo!
Uh-- Uh-- Pongo?

811
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,080
Our puppies,
are they all right?

812
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,480
No time to explain.
There's trouble.

813
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,480
A big hull a baloo.
Come along!

814
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,680
Follow me!

815
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,560
Ah, ha-ha-ha!

816
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,840
Now we've got'em, Horace.
They've run out of room.

817
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,080
What have we got here?
A couple of spotted hyenas?

818
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,320
C'mon, Horace.
Give'em what for.

819
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,680
I'm right
behind ya, lad.

820
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,400
Uh... oh!

821
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,320
You clumsy clod!

822
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,040
I'll knock the spots off you.
Let go!

823
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,160
Let go!

824
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,200
[Barking]

825
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,440
Well, by George!

826
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,520
[Whimpering]

827
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,600
You mangy mongrel!

828
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,880
I'll knock your
blinkin' block off.

829
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,200
Yeow!

830
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,360
Blast'em, Tibs.
Give'em what for.

831
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,600
No, Colonel.
Retreat, retreat!

832
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:39,080
Yes. Yes, of course.
Retreat!

833
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,800
Retreat, on the double!

834
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,600
Help, Jasper!
Get me out of here!

835
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,680
Horace, they're
fighting dirty!

836
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,800
Oh, oh, oh!

837
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:02,880
Oh, oh, oh!
Jasper!

838
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:04,880
Horace!

839
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,600
[Groaning]

840
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,640
C'mon, Perdy.
Let's go.

841
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,000
I'll skin every one
of them spotted hyenas...

842
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,720
if it's
the last thing I do.

843
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,600
[Puppies]
Dad! Mother!

844
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,680
- I missed you, Mommy.
- Here we are, Mommy.

845
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,280
Oh, my darlings...
my darlings!

846
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,800
- How'd you find us?
- Lucky, Patch, Pepper!

847
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,280
[Laughing]
Oh, Daddy.

848
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:46,280
- And Roly, you rascal!
- Did you bring me anything to eat?

849
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,680
Everybody here?
All 15?

850
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,240
Twice that many, Dad.
Now there's 99 of us!

851
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:55,080
What?
Nine-- 99?

852
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,400
[Pongo] Where did they
all come from?

853
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,920
[Perdy] What would she want
with so many?

854
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,800
She's gonna make
coats out of us.

855
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,360
- She couldn't!
- That's right, dog-skin coats.

856
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:09,200
Oh, dog-skin coats!
Come now, Tibs!

857
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,040
But it's true, sir.

858
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:14,640
Horace and Jasper were gonna
pop us of and... skin us!

859
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,040
She's a devil, a witch!
What'll we do?

860
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,760
We have to get back
to London somehow.

861
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,400
What about the others?
What'll they do?

862
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,120
Perdy, we'll take them
home with us... all of them.

863
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,520
Our pets would
never turn them out.

864
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,120
Colonel, sir,

865
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,040
It's a truck
headin' this way.

866
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:36,240
[Tibs] It's the baduns,
Horace and Jasper.

867
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,160
They're folowing
our tracks.

868
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,720
We've got'em
outnumbered, Tibs.

869
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,280
When I give the signal,
we'll attack.

870
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,120
Sir, I'm afraid that
would be disastrous.

871
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:48,280
Ahem!
Oh, think so?

872
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,960
We'd better
run for it.

873
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,240
Out the back,
across the pasture.

874
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:54,400
Thank you sergeant,
Colonel, Captain.

875
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,120
- Bless you all.
- How can we ever repay you?

876
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,600
Ahem! Nothing at all.
All in the line of duty.

That's right, sir...

878
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,760
Better be of.
Here they come.

879
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,560
C'mon, kids, hurry.

880
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:13,000
- Good luck, Pongos.
- [Colonel] And never fear.

881
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,000
We'll hold them of
'til the bitter end.

882
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,880
[Neighing]

883
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:20,040
Now, what's this?

884
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,000
Out of my way,
you barkin' haystack.

885
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,520
Or I'll knock your
blinkin' block of!

[Barking And Growling]

887
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,640
They ain't in here.

888
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,440
[Jasper] They're hiding
in the hay.

889
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,040
Give me a match.
We'll burn'em out.

890
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,840
Ready, Captain.
Aim,

891
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,880

892
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,000
Fire two.

893
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:52,360
Hey, there they go,
the little sneaks.

894
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,920
C'mon, back to the truck.
We'll head'em of in half a mile.

895
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,120
They gotta be around
here somewhere.

896
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,640
- I've been thinkin'.
- Now, Horace.

897
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:13,040
What if they went down
the froze-up creek...

898
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,440
so's not to leave
their tracks?

899
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,560
Horace, you idiot!

900

All clear, Perdy.

903
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:36,160
-All clear.
- We gave'em the slip!
Didn't we, Dad?

904
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,720
They didn't even
see us, Patch!

905
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,560
[Perdy] Shh, children.
Children, shh.

906
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,280
My feet are slippery.

907
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,960
I wish we could
walk on the snow.

908
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,680
No, son, we can't
leave tracks.

909

[Honking, Tyres Screeching]

910
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,440
Well, any sign
of them?

911
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,560
Not so much as
one bloomin' footprint.

912
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:31,000
And we've been up and down
every road in the county.

913
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,680
- We're froze stiff. We're givin' up.
- Oh, no, you don't!

914
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:38,680
We'll find the little mongrels
if it takes' til next Christmas.

915
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,560
Now get going!
Watch your driving!

916
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:45,000

nabbed by the police?

We can't give up now.

- The dairy barn across the road.
- C'mon, kids.

Just look, Queenie.

- Aren't they adorable!

- Perfectly darling.
- The poor dears.

We were so worried about you.

Been trying to reach you.
Afraid you'd been captured.

all this way?

- And in such dreadful weather.
- With all those little ones.

- Where is the milk?

- for you and the miss us.
- Oh, thank you.

hold you as far as Dinsford.

we'd have done if--

- We're honoured to be of service.
- We're sorry we can't do more.

of hurting these puppies--

A ride home?
Perdy, did you hear that?

990
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:36,160
- For all of us?
- You mean we don't have to
walk any more?

991
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:39,560
If we can manage it.
We'd better hurry.

992
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,920
We've got a ride home!
C'mon, children.

Did you hear that, Freckles?
Dad wants us to get dirty.

1013

- Do as your father says.

01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:18,240
- How's this, Dad?
- Wait. That's enough.
Not too many at a time.

1019
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,280
Uh-oh. Roly, hold on.
You're only half done.

1020
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:25,640
Now, stay right with me.

1021

01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:41,320
Pongo...

1023
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:44,240
I'm so afraid.

1024
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,440
Jasper, do you suppose
they disguised themselves?

1025
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:53,880
Say now, Horace.
That's just what they did.

1026
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:57,520
Dogs is always paint in'
themselves black!

1027
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,720
You idiot!

1028
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,720
Well, so far
so good.

1029
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,120
C'mon, Perdy.
Better get on your make-up.

1030
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,720
I'll go ahead
with the next bunch.

1031
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:24,800
[Cruela]
Jasper! Horace!

1032
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,160
- Well?
- Be reasonable, miss.

1033
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,720
[Horace] We're froze to our bones.

1034
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,640
We've been out all night
and all day, with nothin' to eat.

1035
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:38,720
They're somewhere in this vilage,
and we're going to find them.

1036
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,880
Now get going!

1037
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,960
- Do you think they've seen us?
- [Engine]

1038
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,560
No, but we're
running out of time.

1039
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,680
Try'er again, mate.

1040
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:55,280
Hurry, Perdy.
The van's about to leave.

1041
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,360
Better hurry.

1042
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,960
I'll get the rest.

1043
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,880
That ought to do.
She'll get you back to London.

1044
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:29,680
Better get aboard, miss.

1045
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,480
Hey, Jasper.

1046
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:42,240
[Whimpering]

1047
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,480
C'mon, Horace.

1048
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:53,240
Hurry, kids!

1049
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,280
C'mon, kids.
Run on ahead.

1050
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:08,120
- She's watching us, Dad.
- Keep going.

1051
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:19,680
It can't be!

1052
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:22,680
It's impossible!

1053
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,040
[Labrador] Run for it!

1054
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,400
-Jasper! Horace!
- [Honking]

1055
01:10:29,560 --> 01:10:32,760
Jasper!

1056
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:37,240
[Cruela] There they go...
in the van.

1057
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,560
After them! After them!

1058
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:43,320
[Barking And Growling]

1059
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,640
Pongo!
There she is... Cruela.

1060
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:14,280
Hey, lady,

1061
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,800
what in thunder
are you tryin' to do?

1062
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,760
Crazy woman driver!

1063
01:11:37,320 --> 01:11:40,080
[Engine Rewing]

1064
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:57,280
- Pongo, look!
-Jasper!

1065
01:11:57,440 --> 01:11:59,240
Ain't nothin' to it.

1066
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:03,080
I'll give him a nudge
and shove him in the dirt.

1067
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:17,640
Perdy, watch out!

1068
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:28,240
-Jasper!
- Horace!

1069
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,040
You idiots!

1070
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:45,920
You fools!

1071
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:49,240
[Sobbing]
You imbeciles!

1072
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,760
- Ah, shut up!
- [Sobbing]

1073
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:55,160
[Radio]
#You've seen her kind of eyes#

1074
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,600
#Watchin'you from underneath a rock#

1075
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,840
#Cruela de Vil#

1076
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,520
#Cruela de--#

1077
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:07,800
Roger, after all,
that's your first big hit.

1078
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:10,320
It's made more money
than we ever dreamed of.

1079
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,040
Yes, I know.

1080
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:15,320
I still can't believe...

1081
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,040
that Pongo and Perdy
would run away.

1082
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:22,520
Here's a bit of
Christmas cheer for you,

1083
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,920
If there's anything
to be cheerful about.

1084
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,400
Oh, those dear
little things.

1085
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:34,080
Sometimes at night
I can hear them barking,

1086
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:38,200
- [Barking]
- but it always turns out I'm dreaming.

1087
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,480
[Barking]

1088
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,640
[Anita] Roger, what on earth--

1089
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,800
[Roger] They're Labradors.

1090
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,840
No, no.
They're covered with soot.

1091
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,760
Look, here's Lucky!

1092
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,400
Pongo, boy,
is that you?

1093
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,800
Oh, Pongo, Pongo!
Ho-ho, it's Pongo!

1094
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:04,560
And Perdy,
my darling.

1095
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,120
And Patch, and Roly,

1096
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,920
and Penny, and Freckles.

1097
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:12,280
They're all here,
the little dears.

1098
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:15,160
- It's a miracle!
- What a wonderful Christmas present!

1099
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:18,040
And look...
there's a whole lot more!

1100
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:23,160
- Look, Anita, puppies everywhere.
- There must be 100!

1101
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:27,080
One, two, three and
four... is seven.

1102
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:30,320
Two, four, six, and three
is nine, plus two is eleven.

1103
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:33,600
- 36 over here.
- 36 and 1 1 , that's 47!

1104
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,440
- Eighteen, Roger.
- That's 65!

1105
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:39,440
Ten, eleven,
twelve, thirteen!

1106
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:44,120
- Wait... six more.
- Let's see, that's 84.

1107
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:47,880
And fifteen plus two...
a hundred and one!

1108
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:52,320
A hundred and one?
Where did they come from?

1109
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:56,120
Oh, Pongo,
you old rascal!

1110
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:58,480
- What'l we do with them?
- We'll keep'em.

1111
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:02,520
- In this little house?
- We'll buy a big place in the country.

1112
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:07,160
We'll have a plantation--
a Dalmatian plantation.

1113
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,880
Roger, that's truly
an inspiration.

1114
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:11,800
It'll be a sensation!

1115
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:15,000
We'll have
a Dalmatian plantation.

1116
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,120
A Dalmatian plantation,
I say.

1117
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:20,960
#We'll have a Dalmatian plantation#

1118
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:24,480
-#Where our population can roam#
- I'm hungry.

1119
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:28,160
#Our whole aggregation
will love our plantation home#

1120
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,520
