1
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,672
We can't hold out much longer, sir!

2
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,620
General Hummel, you've gotta
get us outta here now!

3
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,707
I won't let you down.
I won't let you down, son

4
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,381
Goddamn it, sir! How long do
we have to wait?

5
00:01:29,381 --> 00:01:30,883
I've lost 15 men already!

6
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:34,595
Sir, they're lightin' us up
like a firestorm!

7
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,097
This is General Hummel.
You gotta get my men outta there!

8
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:40,684
We don't have clearance
to go behind enemy lines, sir

9
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:46,481
They're not coming for us,
are they, sir?

10
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:59,578
Congressman Weaver and esteemed members
of the Special Armed Service Committee

11
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,956
I come before you to protest
a grave injustice

12
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:16,011
Aim!

13
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,306
It has to stop

14
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,768
I miss you so much

15
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,406
There's something I've gotta do, Barb

16
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,742
Something I couldn't do
while you were here

17
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,120
I trid

18
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:27,791
you know I tried everything,
and I still don't have their attention.

19
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,463
Let's hope this elevates their thinking.

20
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,008
But whatever happens...

21
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,429
Please don't think less of me.

22
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,184
Marine, inform the garrison C. O. that
General Hummel's coming on board...

23
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,728
- with a security inspection team.
- Yes, sir.

24
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,731
Sir, it's an honor having you,
sir.

25
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,581
Aah!

26
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:01,802
- Uuh!
- Oof!

27
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,221
Ya know, at least
we can get some...

28
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:12,563
- Yeah, I'll tell ya.
- Uuh! - Ooh!

29
00:05:12,688 --> 00:05:16,441
Aah! Aah!

30
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,026
Uuh!

31
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:27,286
I got the access card. We got 30
minutes 'til those darts wear off.

32
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,871
Move it!

33
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,585
The access card, sir.

34
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,839
Let's do it.

35
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,555
2400 magazine check.

36
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:04,781
- Man, it's wet out there!
- Check me through, will ya?

37
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,127
Clear!

38
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,989
- I want 16, Major!
- Move it!

39
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:16,270
- Evac! Seal the door!
- No! No!

40
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,689
Come on, man!
Seal it!

41
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,358
No-o-o!

42
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:26,029
Let me outta here! Oh, God!
Let me outta here! Oh, God!

43
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,198
Let me out! God!

44
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:32,369
Clear out.
Get outta here!

45
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,567
Two more cc's
of acetylene chloride.

46
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,947
That'll be five dollars, Isherwood.

47
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:11,783
You suck.

48
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,959
You guys have too much time
on your hands.

49
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:25,464
Yes! She's here! Bring it
to me now. Thank you, Phil!

50
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:28,008
What's that?
Why'd you get it sent here?

51
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:33,013
Carla wouldn't approve. She thinks
it's dumb to spend $600 on an L. P.

52
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,100
Carla's right. Why don't you
just spend $13 on a CD, man?

53
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,686
First of all,
it's because I'm a Beatlemaniac.

54
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,147
And second,
these sound better.

55
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,319
Could be sarin gas.

56
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,574
A dog out of JFK caught a whiff
of something in this package...

57
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,576
postmarked to
a Bosnian refugee camp.

58
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,496
It could be detergent,
or it could be sarin gas.

59
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,540
Bosnian refugee camp?

60
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,918
Half a million Serbians reside in the
U. S., Marvin. Serbians don't like Bosnians.

61
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,254
You guys wanna get suited up?

62
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,885
- You bring the cockroaches?
- Got 'em.

63
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,096
We have air lock, Stanley.
You're all set to go.

64
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,980
October 1, 0900 hours.

65
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:26,817
Agent Stanley Goodspeed,
Agent/Trainee Marvin Isherwood...

66
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:32,906
Suspicion of sarin gas inside.

67
00:09:33,115 --> 00:09:35,200
- Marvin, sarin is a...
- G. B. aerosol.

68
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:38,745
That is correct.
let's see. We have some dirty magazines.

69
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:42,082
Stone Age Cave Girls in the Raw.
Kinky.

70
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:45,544
And, uh... Not a good sign.

71
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:49,548
Hello, little baby doll.
Lookit, Stan.

72
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:53,135
- Hi there, Stanley.
- Marvin! don't!

73
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:54,845
Hi, Stan.

74
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,599
Shit! Move back! Move back!

75
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:01,268
- power landings offed.
- Hang on, guys.

76
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,812
We'll have that room clear
in 50 seconds! You're gonna be okay.

77
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:06,231
Jesus Christ!

78
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:10,027
Okay, I've got some bad news
and some really bad news.

79
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:14,489
The bad news is that the gas is
corrosive and it's eating our suits.

80
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,659
- It's all over my hand, man!
- The really bad news...

81
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:21,497
is there's enough C-4 explosive and
poison gas to blow the whole chamber...

82
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,499
- and kill everybodyin the building.
- Detonation too heavy.

83
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,834
- Everybody, out of the room now!
- Seal us inside.

84
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,674
Where are the sprinklers, Lonner?

85
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:37,679
The acid's eating my su... It's eating
my fucking suit! All right? Shit!

86
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:41,183
- Just wash us off!
- Where are my sprinklers?

87
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,101
We're working on it.
It's coming. It's just a flow problem.

88
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,812
Well, that's a pretty big
friggin' problem, Lonner. Fix it now!

89
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,106
- We're working on it! How much time
do you have on that detonator?

90
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:50,150
- A minute ten.
- Look at this!

91
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,653
We're gonna have the room clear.

92
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,738
- Tell 'em to take the atropine, now!
- The atropine, Isherwood.

93
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,533
- What?
- Where's my water, Lonner? One minute!

94
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:02,162
- Marvin, the atropine, now!
- Inject it in your heart before your suit melts.

95
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,540
Shit!

96
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:08,126
- Make him take his dose.
- Where's that water?

97
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:13,090
- Get that away from me!
- Come on, Phil, fix it for Christ's sake!

98
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:17,052
- Take the atropine now, Stan, for Christ's sake!
- We're fucked.

99
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,848
- The poison's mixing.
- What the fuck are you waiting for?

100
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,977
- You take the fucking needle now!
- Fuck! Shit! Oh, fuck, shit...

101
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,604
- Forty seconds!
- If that suit melts...

102
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,065
If you die, we all die! Inject your heart

103
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,568
- and then diffuse the bomb!
- Come on, just do it, Stan!

104
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,153
Shit! What if I miss my heart?
I can't see shit!

105
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,781
- Do it now!
- Look how big this is.

106
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:41,577
You want me to stick this into my heart?
Are you fucking nuts?

107
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,829
The sprinkler's coming! It's coming! The sprinkler's
coming! It's coming! The sprinkler's coming! It's coming!

108
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:46,206
Okay, here we go, man!

109
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,711
Sprinkler activated.

110
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,754
How much time left?

111
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:55,883
Twenty seconds!

112
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,218
We're not gonna make it.

113
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,471
Fifteen.

114
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,268
Oh, come on.

115
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,645
Clear!

116
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:13,192
Get me the fuck out of this gas chamber!

117
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,236
I almost stabbed myself
in the heart with this thing.

118
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:19,406
"Please lock me away"

119
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:21,909
- Stan?
- Hey, darlin'.

120
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:25,704
Hi, baby.

121
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:29,041
"Here inside where I hide with my loneliness"

122
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,168
I had such
an interesting day today.

123
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,046
Yeah, I had kind of
an interesting day myself.

124
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,216
Oh, okay, you go first.

125
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:41,303
Oh, just some terrorists decided to send
a little care package, box of goodies...

126
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:45,933
which had to be neutralized
before blowing up the office.

127
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:49,394
So I took the rest of the day off.
Glass of wine, little guitar...

128
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,564
- Just relaxing.
- Wow!

129
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:56,401
The world is being Fed-Ex'd to hell on a handcart.

130
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,947
I really believe that anyone who's even
thinking about having a child in this world...

131
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,116
is coldly considering
an act of cruelty.

132
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:07,788
I know, I'm rambling, I'm complaining.
I'm sorry. What's your news, baby?

133
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:11,416
- I'm pregnant.
- I'm sorry?

134
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,002
I'm pregnant.

135
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,967
- Really?
- Yeah.

136
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,720
- Wow!
- Is that all you're gonna say, is "wow"?

137
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,306
- You're pregnant?
- Three weeks.

138
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,642
How do you know? I mean,
how do you know?

139
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,312
Blue!

140
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:35,357
Just turned blue
so I went to the doctor.

141
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:38,485
- Well, you didn't mean what you just said, did you?
- When?

142
00:13:38,694 --> 00:13:41,071
Uh, just right now when you were talking
about bringing a child into the world...

143
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:44,992
and having it be an act of cruelty.
I meant it at the time.

144
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,786
Stanley, at the time? You said
it seven and a half seconds ago.

145
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:53,709
Well, gosh! Kind of a lot's happened
since then. Look, we're not even married.

146
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:56,837
I know. It's funny
you should mention that.

147
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,756
It's funny?
Do you love me?

148
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:03,218
Of course I love you.
Good.

149
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,393
- Will you marry me?
- Whoa! Whoa! Wai... Hey, Marriage Police, pull over!

150
00:14:11,602 --> 00:14:14,855
Come on, Stanley.
I'm proposing to you right now.

151
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:28,327
The Rock is the most famous and was
the most feared prison ever built.

152
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:31,330
Is it really true that
there's never been an escape?

153
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:35,417
Ah, that's true. From 1936 until
'63 when the prison closed...

154
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,419
there were 14 attempts.

155
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:41,507
No one is believed to have made
it to shore, alive at least.

156
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,678
No, uh, h-h-hey, hey, fellas. I'm sorry,
but tourists are not allowed back here.

157
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,847
I don't really give a shit!
Do you give a shit?

158
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:51,433
- No. Come here, fruity.
- Move!

159
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,479
- Hey, girls? Hi. You all havin' a good time?
- Yeah.

160
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,607
Will you do something for me?
It's really, it's really important.

161
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:01,985
I need you to tell your teacher that you need
to get back on the boat and go home right now.

162
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:05,531
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Broadway!

163
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:07,991
This cell block housed... This cell
block housed... This cell block housed...

164
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:11,537
the most awesome scum in America.

165
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:15,624
Ladies and gentlemen, I, Ranger Bob
cordially invite you...

166
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:19,044
to become inmates
of Alcatraz, temporarily, of course.

167
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:24,174
On the line!

168
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:28,762
Pretty tight quarters,
aren't they, huh?

169
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,223
Like being a caged animal.

170
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:34,601
Spend a couple of years in there-
What's the matter, fellas?

171
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:37,271
Something wrong with the tour?
- The tour's over, Bob.

172
00:15:43,569 --> 00:15:46,738
What kind of fucked-up tour
is this?

173
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,589
General Hummel, Captains Frye
and Darrow reporting, sir.

174
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:07,426
Welcome to The Rock, gentlemen. Land the
choppers on the back side and deploy as planned.

175
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:09,887
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir. Move out!

176
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,014
I'm not allowed
to carry a gun.

177
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,933
Oh, you're not allowed to carry
a gun? I got a goddamned gun.

178
00:16:15,058 --> 00:16:18,604
If I'd have known this was gonna happen,
I'd have brought my motherfuckin' gun!

179
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:20,898
Help!

180
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:25,152
All right, gentlemen, this'll be our new home.
Tom, I want my command center right here.

181
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,412
- I want Coms up.
- Roger that, sir.

182
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:39,917
Put the satellite over there.
I wanna be up at 1600.

183
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,044
Let's move it.

184
00:16:49,927 --> 00:16:52,679
Systems up.

185
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:57,226
Possible penetration point in the shower room.
We're setting anti-intrusion.

186
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:01,355
I brought a personal touch, sir.
It's an anti-motion trembler device.

187
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:05,859
It's custom-made.
Nobody knows about it

188
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:09,279
- What's it do?
- We head-fake 'em with the laser beam.

189
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:13,408
And then if they disturb
Mr. Backup here, we own 'em.

190
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,592
Ladies and gentlemen, you're being
detained against your will.

191
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:35,264
For that, I apologize. It is not
our intention in any way to harm you.

192
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,726
You will not be detained one minute longer than
is necessary for us to complete our mission.

193
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:47,609
Attention on deck!

194
00:17:47,818 --> 00:17:51,029
Stand easy, men.

195
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:56,326
Make no mistake about it, gentlemen,
we are now in harm's way.

196
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:59,454
For Major Baxter and I, this is the last
campaign in a career dating back...

197
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,665
to Tet '68.

198
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:05,002
Likewise for Captain Hendrix,
Gunnery Sergeant Crisp,

199
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,839
who cut their teeth
under my command in Desert Storm.

200
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:13,135
Captain Frye, Captain Darrow, this is
my first operational situation with you,

201
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,429
And I have to say, thus far
your conduct reflects your reputations.

202
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,472
- Thank you, General.
- Thank you, sir.

203
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:20,893
We have achieved our position
through poise, precision and audacity.

204
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,228
To this we must now add resolve.

205
00:18:23,395 --> 00:18:26,773
We'll be branded as traitors,
the gravest capital crime.

206
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:29,359
Punishable by death.

207
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:34,948
Couple hundred years ago, a few guys
named Washington, Jefferson and Adams...

208
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:38,243
were branded as traitors
by the British.

209
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,288
And now they're called patriots.

210
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,373
In time, so shall we.

211
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:49,296
in less than 48 hours, we will
evacuate this island in gunships...

212
00:18:49,505 --> 00:18:52,841
under cover of
hostages and V. X. gas warheads.

213
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:56,428
Your destination:
a non-extradition treaty country.

214
00:18:56,678 --> 00:19:00,766
You will each be paid a fee
of $1 million for services rendered.

215
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:05,395
But you can never again
set foot on your native soil.

216
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:08,941
- Can you live with that?
- Yes, sir!

217
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:11,818
The men of Marine Force Recon
are selected...

218
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:16,031
to carry out illegal operations
throughout the world.

219
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,826
When they don't come home...

220
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,912
their families are told fairy tales
about what happened to them...

221
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,165
and denied compensation.

222
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:28,752
Well, I have choked
on these lies my entire career!

223
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:31,296
Well, here and now the lies stop!

224
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:40,848
God be with all of you.
Man your positions, men.

225
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,187
This is FBI Director Womack.

226
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:50,732
Director, be advised.

227
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,652
Eighty-one, I say again,

228
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:57,656
81 civilians are under
my control as of this moment.

229
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:01,994
You are to take measures to assure this
remains a need-to-know classified fact.

230
00:20:02,161 --> 00:20:06,290
Who is this?
Mr. Director, you have a very serious problem.

231
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,501
A battery of V. X. gas rockets
is presently deployed to deliver...

232
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:14,298
a highly lethal strike on the population
of the San Francisco Bay area.

233
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,300
I will call again at 0100 hours
to state my demands.

234
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,969
- I want to know who I'm talking to.
- This is Brigadier General

235
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:23,473
Francis X. Hummel, United States
Marine Corps, from Alcatraz.

236
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:27,060
I'll cancel your reservations.

237
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,647
Get the Pentagon.
and call the San Francisco office.

238
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,734
It seems Alcatraz was just reopened.

239
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:37,779
Last night General Hummel,
using brutal but nonlethal force...

240
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:39,865
under the guise of a security
exercise,

241
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:43,076
walked off with 15
V. X. poison gas rockets.

242
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,162
He lost one of his own men
in the process.

243
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:48,999
That's General Hummel in Vietnam.
I think he was a major at the time.

244
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:53,295
Three tours in Vietnam,
Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm.

245
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:58,217
Three Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars
and the Congressional Medal of...

246
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:01,720
Jesus! This man is a hero!

247
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:04,014
Well, I think "legend" might be
a better description, Mr. Sinclair.

248
00:21:04,223 --> 00:21:07,851
Well, now we can add kidnapping
and extortion to his list of accolades.

249
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,062
Mr. Sinclair, General Hummel
is a man of honor.

250
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,398
General, it's him.

251
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:19,071
Frank, it's Al Kramer.
Hi, Al, how you doin'?

252
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,823
I don't know, Frank.
Ah, why don't you tell me.

253
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,743
Got a lot of very, very
worried people here, Frank.

254
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,120
I'll come straight to the point.

255
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:30,332
Eight-three Force Reconnaissance Marines
have died under my various commands.

256
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,751
Forty-seven in northern Laos
and southern China.

257
00:21:32,918 --> 00:21:36,046
Southern China? We never admitted
we sent troops into China.

258
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:38,382
Who is this?
Identify yourself.

259
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,385
White House Chief of Staff
Hayden Sinclair, General.

260
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:44,930
How old are you,
Chief of Staff Sinclair?

261
00:21:45,097 --> 00:21:47,516
- I'm 33.
- Well, Mr. Sinclair,

262
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:50,686
you've probably got
no fucking idea what I'm talking about.

263
00:21:50,853 --> 00:21:53,188
By your ninth birthday, I was
runnin' black ops into China...

264
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:56,066
and my men were responsible
for over 200 enemy kills.

265
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:59,111
Al, put some rigging tape
over Mr. Sinclair's mouth.

266
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:02,614
- He's wasting my time.
- Ah, you want to continue, Frank?

267
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:04,908
Remember Operation Desert Storm?

268
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:08,745
Those surgical hits made by
our smart bombs, covered so well on CNN?

269
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:13,542
It was my men on the ground that made
those hits possible by lasing the targets.

270
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:17,045
Twenty of them were left to rot outside
Baghdad after the conflict ended.

271
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:21,216
No benefits were paid to their families.
No medals conferred.

272
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:28,265
These men died for their country, and they
weren't even given a goddamn military burial.

273
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:32,102
The situation is unacceptable.

274
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,730
You will transfer $100 million
from the Grand Cayman...

275
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,774
Red Sea Trading Company account
to an account I designate.

276
00:22:37,941 --> 00:22:40,777
From these funds, reparations
of $1 million will be paid...

277
00:22:40,944 --> 00:22:43,280
to each of
the 83 marines' families.

278
00:22:43,447 --> 00:22:46,867
The rest of the funds I will
disperse at my discretion.

279
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,203
Do I make myself clear?

280
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,664
Except for the Red Sea Trading Company.
What is that?

281
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:55,709
- Identify yourself.
- This is FBI Director Womack, General.

282
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:59,379
It's a slush fund where the Pentagon
keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

283
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:01,965
Jesus, Frank!
This is classified information.

284
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:05,469
You alert the media,
I launch the gas.

285
00:23:05,677 --> 00:23:08,597
You refuse payment,
I launch the gas.

286
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:12,684
You've got 40 hours, 'til noon day after
tomorrow to arrange transfer of the money.

287
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:16,688
I am aware of your countermeasure. You
know and I know it doesn't stand a chance.

288
00:23:16,855 --> 00:23:18,815
Hummel from Alcatraz. Out.

289
00:23:20,734 --> 00:23:22,152
All right.

290
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:25,822
We have to identify the hostages
and contact each of their families.

291
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:29,493
Uh, tell 'em somethin'. Make up a story,
and we've got to keep this undercover.

292
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:33,831
If this comes out, the city of San Francisco
will be in chaos. I am talking anarchy.

293
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:37,376
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What is the potential casualty rate...

294
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:42,172
for a single rocket armed with
V. X. poison gas, General Peterson?

295
00:23:42,381 --> 00:23:45,843
- Sixty or seventy.
- Well, that's, that's not so bad.

296
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:50,180
Thousand. Seventy thousand dead!

297
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:52,891
- Oh.
- One teaspoon of this hits the floor,

298
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,561
it's lethal up to a hundred feet.

299
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:59,064
One teaspoon of this shit
detonated in the atmosphere...

300
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:02,401
will kill every living organism
in an eight-block radius.

301
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:04,987
Get the point?

302
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,948
Uh, what did Hummel mean
by your countermeasure, General?

303
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:11,618
Standard poison is countered by napalm. It
burns it up, consumes it upon detonation.

304
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:15,789
Now, the problem with V. X. poison gas
is that it's designed specifically...

305
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:19,209
to withstand napalm. That's where
thermite plasma comes in. General Peterson?

306
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:22,588
- General Peterson?
- Thermite plasma incendiary systems...

307
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:25,799
can burn hot enough to consume V. X.
but they're still in the test phase;

308
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:29,761
it's not operational.
Hummel knows this.

309
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,931
We are dealing with
one smart son of a bitch.

310
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,684
What's it gonna take to equip
a flight of F-18s...

311
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,312
with thermite plasma...
within the next 36 hours?

312
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,899
- An act of God.
- Excuse me?

313
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:44,359
All right, we can try.

314
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:48,363
But I strongly urge you to consider the
use of this as a secondary initiative.

315
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,866
Then we have to go to our
primary initiative. Uh, Admiral?

316
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:54,495
Sir, I'd like to bring in our SEAL
ground commander, Commander Anderson.

317
00:24:54,703 --> 00:24:59,291
Mr. Womack, who is
your best chemical/biological man?

318
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,835
Oh, that's interesting.

319
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:04,838
- Oh, yeah.
- That's very compelling.

320
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:10,177
You like my pigtails?

321
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:13,222
Oh, yeah, the pigtails
are very naughty.

322
00:25:13,388 --> 00:25:16,266
Naughty. Naughty.

323
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,102
Just the Amaretto cream
with peach sorbet persuasion.

324
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:22,064
This isn't happening.

325
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:24,441
- No, Stan, don't answer it.
- This isn't happening!

326
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:27,027
- No, just don't answer it. It's okay.
- I have to.

327
00:25:27,236 --> 00:25:29,321
- I have to. It's the office, baby. They know I'm home.
- No.

328
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:33,283
- How could they possibly know that you're home?
- It's the FBI.

329
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:39,373
- Stanley!
- Goodspeed.

330
00:25:39,581 --> 00:25:42,251
Uh, yeah. O-Okay, yeah.
I'll be, I'll be down,

331
00:25:42,376 --> 00:25:45,295
- downstairs in ten minutes.
- No, you won't.

332
00:25:47,506 --> 00:25:51,677
- I have to go to San Francisco.
- No, you don't.

333
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,930
Stanley, no, you do not have
to go to San Francisco.

334
00:25:55,013 --> 00:25:57,683
Are you kidding me right now? You need
to stay here and talk to me about things.

335
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,811
- I've got to go, baby.
- Oh! I am Catholic!

336
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:03,313
Do you realize that?
I am pregnant and I am unmarried.

337
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,816
And this causes
a serious problem for me.

338
00:26:05,983 --> 00:26:07,818
I cannot believe you.

339
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:18,996
No, no.

340
00:26:19,163 --> 00:26:22,624
I love you.

341
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:27,171
I will marry you.
I just didn't plan on this, that's all.

342
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:30,174
Come to San Francisco.

343
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,343
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm sure it's just a training exercise.

344
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,721
Check into the hotel.
Order up some champagne.

345
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,931
- And we'll finish what we started?
- Exactly.

346
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:40,184
- Baby, you're gonna marry me?
- You know it.

347
00:26:40,434 --> 00:26:43,854
You're gonna marry me!
Oh, honey, come on.

348
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:46,356
- Just a really quick one.
- Oh, oh, I gotta go now.

349
00:26:46,732 --> 00:26:49,693
A nighttime airdrop incursion
is out due to the full moon.

350
00:26:49,776 --> 00:26:51,820
Likewise a frontal
seaside attack.

351
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:54,907
If we're compromised and shots
are fired, Hummel might launch.

352
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:57,701
Our only alternative
is an attack from within the prison.

353
00:26:57,868 --> 00:27:01,246
We penetrate the island through the tunnels
under the prison buildings undetected...

354
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:04,541
and emerge in its center; that way
we can jump the marines from behind.

355
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:08,128
And if we're lucky, take their
rocket positions without a shot fired.

356
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:10,881
I don't understand. You-you've studied
the architectural plans?

357
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:14,760
They're useless. Alcatraz has been
ripped up and rebuilt for years.

358
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:17,888
- Under there is a maze of shit.
- Well, there's no question, gentlemen.

359
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:20,432
We need firsthand intelligence
of the tunnel systems.

360
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:23,810
- So what about the former warden?
- Died in 1979.

361
00:27:23,936 --> 00:27:26,230
All the guards we contacted
were useless.

362
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:30,526
Um, there is someone
who I think can help us.

363
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,406
This is for the sake
of national security.

364
00:27:36,573 --> 00:27:40,828
No! It's the sake of national security that
got us here in the first place 33 years ago.

365
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:44,331
I knew! I knew someday this would come back
to bite us. Forget it!

366
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:47,501
- He does not exist.
- He does exist!

367
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:51,171
He does exist! We just chose to forget him for 30 years.
We locked him up and threw away the key.

368
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,382
Oh, and a lot of goddamn
good it did us.

369
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,802
He broke out of two maximum-security
prisons. And if he hits the streets...

370
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:59,137
He's not gonna hit the streets, Jim.

371
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:02,224
Thirty years ago he was
a highly-trained SAS operative.

372
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:07,145
He is my age now, for Christ's sake! I have
to get up three times a night to take a piss.

373
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:09,690
We can't risk letting him out.

374
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:13,110
He's a professional
escape artist.

375
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:47,186
Oh, here he is now.

376
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:50,022
- Ah. Neat, uh...
- Yeah.

377
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,566
- Neat, neat plane.
- Dr. Goodspeed. James Womack.

378
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:55,194
- A pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Welcome.

379
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:57,654
You come very highly recommended.
B. A. Columbia;

380
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:59,781
M. A., PhD, Johns Hopkins.

381
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,034
Biochemistry, toxicology.

382
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:04,620
Well, I'm one of those fortunate
people who like my job, sir.

383
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,623
Got my first chemistry set when I
was seven. Blew my eyebrows off.

384
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,584
We never saw the cat again.
Been into it ever since.

385
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:13,045
- What do you know about V. X. gas?
- Liquid.

386
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:15,881
Failed pesticide discovered
by a mistake in 1952.

387
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:18,842
Actually, it's kind of like champagne that way.
The Franciscan monks thought...

388
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:22,346
they were making white wine. Somehow the
bottle carbonated. Voila! Champagne.

389
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:25,933
- The gas, Dr. Goodspeed.
- It's very, very horrible, sir.

390
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:28,810
It's one of those things
we wish we could disinvent.

391
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:32,356
This isn't a "train" exercise, is it?

392
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:36,944
No, Dr. Goodspeed,
it's not a training exercise.

393
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:18,944
This is Ernest Paxton, agent in charge
of the West Coast operation.

394
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:21,488
- Dr. Goodspeed.
- Pleasure to meet you.

395
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:24,074
- How do you do, sir?
- It's been a fairly interesting day so far.

396
00:30:24,283 --> 00:30:26,410
The prisoner's here. Shall we?

397
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:29,997
Now, my boys, they haven't been
able to find a file on this guy.

398
00:30:30,164 --> 00:30:32,666
- Who is he anyway, sir?
- His name is John Mason,

399
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:36,712
a British national
incarcerated on Alcatraz in 1962,

400
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:39,256
escaped in '63.

401
00:30:39,423 --> 00:30:43,844
- I was under the impression that no one
ever escaped Alcatraz, sir. - Paxton, don't argue!

402
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:48,098
This man has no identity, not in
the United States or Great Britain.

403
00:30:48,307 --> 00:30:51,435
He does not exist. Understand?
I want one thing:

404
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:55,480
how he escaped The Rock. Specifically,
the route he took through the island's bowels.

405
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:57,608
The papers are in order, sir.

406
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:00,694
We're prepared to offer him
a full pardon.

407
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:04,281
And Paxton, no strong-arming Mason.
I know him too well.

408
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,159
Well, if you know him,
then why don't you question him?

409
00:31:07,326 --> 00:31:11,163
No, he'll remember me. I don't want
his anger clouding the issue.

410
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:13,248
All right, I'll take care of him.

411
00:31:21,507 --> 00:31:25,344
Mr. Mason, I'm Special Agent
in Charge, Ernest Paxton.

412
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:30,182
In charge of what? Fucking me over
for another three decades?

413
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:33,268
I don't know anything about your
previous matters. I'm here because...

414
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:36,939
a special situation exists that we feel
you might be able to help us with.

415
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:40,567
Now, what might that be? I've been
in jail longer than Nelson Mandela,

416
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:43,070
so maybe you want me
to run for president.

417
00:31:43,237 --> 00:31:46,240
- Not exactly.
- Mmm, a pity.

418
00:31:46,448 --> 00:31:49,660
- I feel rather like Alcamenes.
- Who?

419
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:53,080
Alcamenes. He was imprisoned
by his king in ancient Greece.

420
00:31:53,247 --> 00:31:56,166
Like Sir Walter Raleigh. The same fate.

421
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:59,211
- James the First.
- Even someone as bright as you

422
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:03,549
must be aware that, uh, there's
a certain pattern emerging here.

423
00:32:03,715 --> 00:32:07,469
- Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn?
- Yeah, I heard of him.

424
00:32:07,678 --> 00:32:10,097
Didn't he play hockey
for the fuckin' Red Wings?

425
00:32:10,264 --> 00:32:12,641
- That's the chap.
- Get this straight, pops.

426
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,102
I don't like you any more
than you like me.

427
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:17,604
But I'm here to make you
a legitimate offer.

428
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:19,898
You wanna hear what
I have to say or not?

429
00:32:20,107 --> 00:32:23,819
By all means, dear Paxton.
By all means.

430
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:27,072
We got a problem in a place
that I think you know.

431
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:29,741
There's a hostage situation
on Alcatraz.

432
00:32:29,992 --> 00:32:33,620
- Hostage?
- Eighty-one tourists.

433
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:36,790
The Rock has become
a tourist attraction?

434
00:32:36,999 --> 00:32:40,627
Why don't we cut the shit, huh?
You know The Rock. You broke out.

435
00:32:40,836 --> 00:32:44,173
- Yes, successfully.
- Yeah.

436
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:46,717
So why don't you do yourself
a favor while you're helpin' us?

437
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:49,678
I mean, it'd be nice to get out of jail
while you're still vertical.

438
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:52,973
Hmm? While you got a little lead
left in your pencil.

439
00:32:54,683 --> 00:32:57,477
While I'm considering your offer...

440
00:32:57,603 --> 00:33:01,690
I want a suite
in the Fairmont Hotel.

441
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:04,693
You know I'm here
to cut you a deal.

442
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:09,114
I am not here to bend over
and take it up the ass from you.

443
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:12,534
Here. Here's a quarter.

444
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:19,625
Do yourself a favor. Call your lawyer.

445
00:33:19,833 --> 00:33:21,668
You're goin' back to jail.

446
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:27,758
- Y-You're sending him back to jail?
- I'm not sending him anywhere.

447
00:33:27,925 --> 00:33:31,136
I'm just givin' him
somethin' to think about.

448
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:33,347
I don't think we have time for him
to just sit around and think about it.

449
00:33:33,555 --> 00:33:37,434
- Oh, really?
- No, Goodspeed's right. You go talk to him.

450
00:33:37,643 --> 00:33:40,312
- Me? Sir, I'm not qualified for that.
- Yes.

451
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:43,649
- You're an FBI agent!
- W-What is your specialty again?

452
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:46,443
- Chemical weapons.
- Don't mention that!

453
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:52,783
- You want me to lie?
- Yeah, lie.

454
00:33:54,368 --> 00:33:57,287
We got less than 24 hours.
Give it a shot.

455
00:33:59,248 --> 00:34:01,083
Okay.

456
00:34:06,255 --> 00:34:07,422
Hi.

457
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:10,300
I'm an agent with the, uh,

458
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:12,970
uh, F-Federal... FBI

459
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:17,558
Eh, well, my... I'm Stanley Goodspeed.

460
00:34:17,766 --> 00:34:21,103
- But of course you are.
- Well, at least he got his name right.

461
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:25,691
- Of course I am. Huh.
- And you have an emergency.

462
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:29,236
That's right.

463
00:34:29,403 --> 00:34:33,657
- And you need my help.
- Exactly right.

464
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:35,659
Coffee.

465
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:38,120
No, no, I'm fine.
Thank you.

466
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:40,455
Offer me coffee.

467
00:34:40,622 --> 00:34:43,876
Oh, yes! Well, that was,
in fact, gonna be my next...

468
00:34:44,042 --> 00:34:46,795
Can we get a cup of coffee
in here, please?

469
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:49,756
And offer to take these off.

470
00:34:49,923 --> 00:34:52,134
Mr. Mason, really.

471
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:55,429
- All kidding aside.
- As a gesture of your good faith.

472
00:34:58,724 --> 00:35:02,519
- Prisoner requests to have his handcuffs taken off.
- No, no, no, no.

473
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:07,024
Why don't you go ahead and have
his handcuffs taken off, please?

474
00:35:07,191 --> 00:35:09,693
Well, I guess
that's one way to go.

475
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:15,991
This is a pardon and release contract
from the Attorney General's office.

476
00:35:16,158 --> 00:35:20,579
Now, it makes you a free man
provided you cooperate.

477
00:35:20,787 --> 00:35:25,042
So if you'll just, uh, sign...
uh, at, uh, where it says...

478
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:28,378
- "Signature"?
- That's... Yes. "Signature."

479
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:33,967
Well, timeo danaos et dona ferentis.

480
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:37,346
"I fear the Greeks
even when they bring gifts."

481
00:35:37,513 --> 00:35:39,932
Oh, an educated man!

482
00:35:40,098 --> 00:35:43,894
That rules out the possibility
of you being a field agent.

483
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:48,190
In point of fact,
I am a field agent, Mr. Mason.

484
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:50,442
- Really?
- Yes.

485
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:54,154
- In which field?
- Antiterrorism.

486
00:35:54,363 --> 00:35:58,325
Then you're trained in weaponry,
explosives and mortal combat.

487
00:35:58,534 --> 00:36:00,410
Well-trained.

488
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:03,789
Then it's the Fairmont Hotel.

489
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,168
Okay.

490
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:12,506
I want a suite,
a shower, a shave...

491
00:36:12,673 --> 00:36:14,967
and the feel of a suit.

492
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:18,220
May I also suggest, uh, a haircut?

493
00:36:18,387 --> 00:36:21,849
- Am I out of style? - Unless you're
a 20-year-old guitarist from Seattle.

494
00:36:22,057 --> 00:36:24,935
- It's a grunge thing.
- Grunge?

495
00:36:25,102 --> 00:36:28,021
Yeah, well, uh, uh...
Okay, thank you very much.

496
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:31,233
All right. Call the Fairmont.
Close the floor if necessary,

497
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:34,361
but I want him sealed off.
And he gets two hours max.

498
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:53,839
- Great job, Goodspeed. - Why didn't you throw
in a trip to Tahiti while you were at it?

499
00:36:54,006 --> 00:36:55,841
- I'll deliver this
to the Attorney General.

500
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:59,011
Ah, no, you'll give it to me. Reynolds.
And take Attorney Reynolds outside.

501
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:01,722
There's a car waiting for you.
Thank you.

502
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:08,187
That's a signed federal document, sir.
Isn't that illegal?

503
00:37:08,437 --> 00:37:10,814
You're not acquainted
with the full facts, Goodspeed.

504
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:15,360
With all due respect, sir, I'd like
clarification. I gave that man my word.

505
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:19,323
Damn it! You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

506
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:23,744
It's, uh, it's, eh,
kind of curious, but, uh,

507
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:27,080
Sir Walter Raleigh, Alcamenes,
Solzhenitsyn, they, un...

508
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:29,166
well, they were all
wrongfully imprisoned.

509
00:37:37,341 --> 00:37:38,759
Womack!

510
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:43,055
Now, why am I not surprised,
you piece of shit!

511
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,682
Eh, peace! Peace!

512
00:37:51,647 --> 00:37:54,983
Hey, we're not home.
Leave a message.

513
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:57,903
Hi, darling, it's, uh, it's me.

514
00:37:58,070 --> 00:38:03,575
Uh, listen, don't come to San Francisco.
I repeat, do not come to San Francisco.

515
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:11,250
Wait. Car...

516
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:17,548
Who's Carla? And why don't you
want her to come to San Francisco?

517
00:38:21,385 --> 00:38:25,556
You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

518
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:27,724
Watch it, he'll bite you.

519
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:40,445
Good. Mobile Command
is fully operational.

520
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:42,990
We'll be there in
approximately two hours.

521
00:38:43,157 --> 00:38:44,992
- I'm not armed, sir.
- Right.

522
00:38:45,159 --> 00:38:47,744
- I am unarmed, sir.
- Well, where's your issue?

523
00:38:47,953 --> 00:38:52,082
I left it in my,
uh, my sock drawer.

524
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:55,127
A gun?

525
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:58,255
For what?
You're a chemical freak.

526
00:38:58,463 --> 00:39:03,427
No, I'm a chemical super-freak,
actually. But I still need a gun.

527
00:39:03,594 --> 00:39:05,554
Give him a goddamn gun.

528
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,810
Have you fired one of
those things since the Academy?

529
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:15,939
"If you're going to San Francisco"

530
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:20,652
"Don't forget to wear
flowers in your hair"

531
00:39:20,903 --> 00:39:25,324
"If you're going to San Francisco"

532
00:39:25,532 --> 00:39:31,163
"You're sure to meet
some gentle people there"

533
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:35,501
- "gentle people there"
- "And you come for..."

534
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:38,545
"If you're going
to San Francisco"

535
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:41,173
Uh, uh, room service?

536
00:39:41,381 --> 00:39:43,258
Ah, listen.
This is the penthouse.

537
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:45,427
Do you do snacks,
drinks? Huh?

538
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:47,721
Hello!

539
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:50,390
- You the barber?
- No. Stylist.

540
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:54,102
- Barber.
- Just clippers. No scissors.

541
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:56,730
No scissors? You've got to be
kidding me, no scissors!

542
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:59,191
I mean, did they tell Picasso,
"No brush"?

543
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:01,109
With scissors,
this man could kill you.

544
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:05,155
I can't cut anyone's balls off
with a trimmer now, can I?

545
00:40:05,364 --> 00:40:10,744
Why don't we do this outside?
Get some sun.

546
00:40:10,953 --> 00:40:15,457
Oh, who did this to you? This is
just not right. In fact, it's nasty!

547
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:19,419
Well, it's a grunge thing.
Well, it's some kind of thing.

548
00:40:19,628 --> 00:40:22,589
Do you think we have time for a sea kelp
protein pack and maybe some color?

549
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:26,593
- No.
- Okay.

550
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:28,929
Not very nice, is he?

551
00:40:29,137 --> 00:40:32,182
No, he's not.

552
00:40:45,487 --> 00:40:47,322
'Cause I'm leavin'

553
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:50,492
Hey, Can't let it go to waste.

554
00:40:50,701 --> 00:40:53,787
- "Don't know when I'll be back again"
- Don't you ever stop eatin'?

555
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:55,956
Not when it's free.

556
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:59,459
- We're supposed to be on duty.
- Hey, don't worry. He's an old man.

557
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:02,546
The boss is watchin' 'im. Come on.
Have... Try some of this lobster.

558
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:06,300
- Mm-hmm.
- My secretary here will settle the bill.

559
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:10,095
So what do you have in store for me,
Womack, when this is over?

560
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:12,973
You'll get your life back, Mason.

561
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,143
But you could've given me
my life back years ago.

562
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:22,107
Why should I trust you now?

563
00:41:22,274 --> 00:41:24,234
You've got my word.

564
00:41:24,443 --> 00:41:26,361
Will you shake on it?

565
00:41:37,664 --> 00:41:39,416
Freeze, mister!

566
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:41,418
Oh, man!

567
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:44,421
Help!

568
00:41:44,588 --> 00:41:47,758
Drop the gun,
or I drop your boss.

569
00:41:47,925 --> 00:41:51,720
You will not!
Get!

570
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:56,308
- He's getting very heavy.
- Then pull him up.

571
00:41:56,517 --> 00:41:58,435
Aah! Uuh!

572
00:41:58,644 --> 00:42:01,230
Please don't!

573
00:42:01,438 --> 00:42:03,106
Ohh!

574
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:05,943
Help! Shit!

575
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:08,779
Come on. Have a scallop. Catch.

576
00:42:08,987 --> 00:42:12,074
Ohh!

577
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:15,619
Ooh-ooh!

578
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:19,665
- You hoist him!
- Yaah! Oh!

579
00:42:19,832 --> 00:42:21,542
Help! Help! Help!

580
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:24,461
- Where's Mason? Where is Mason?
- Help! Hang on!

581
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:26,797
- Mason's gone!
- Gone?

582
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:30,259
Clear.

583
00:42:30,425 --> 00:42:33,804
Living room's clear!

584
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:37,182
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

585
00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:40,185
All units, this is Caretaker.
We have a Signal Six. He's in the hotel!

586
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:50,863
Okay, I don't wanna know nothin'. I never
saw you throw that gentleman off the balcony.

587
00:42:51,029 --> 00:42:55,200
All I care about is, a-are
you happy with your haircut?

588
00:42:55,325 --> 00:42:58,328
Aah! Easy! Aah!

589
00:42:58,537 --> 00:43:03,041
Watch it, you fuckhead,
you're gonna pull my arm out!

590
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,669
Watch out!

591
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,602
Watch it!

592
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,485
- Hey, watch it!
- He's over there!

593
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:37,117
Uuh! Ah!

594
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:38,994
Uuh!

595
00:43:45,334 --> 00:43:47,836
Hey! Uuh! Ooh!

596
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:50,631
This is my Humvee. I don't want
any dings, dents or scratches,

597
00:43:50,881 --> 00:43:55,260
or I'll have your ass. Hey!
Hey! Stop! Hey!

598
00:43:58,555 --> 00:44:02,601
I was inside with Jack Powell!

599
00:44:02,768 --> 00:44:05,729
Hey, call the guard! Go!

600
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:09,525
FBI!

601
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:22,788
Whoo!

602
00:44:28,377 --> 00:44:31,338
Whoa! Whoa!

603
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:34,967
Suspect is in a black Humvee,
heading west on California.

604
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:37,135
Speed approximately
70 miles per hour.

605
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:46,562
Get out of the way!

606
00:44:49,982 --> 00:44:52,401
I want a net put on this
son of a bitch, you hear me?

607
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:28,478
This guy's hittin' every fuckin' thing
in sight tryin' to block us!

608
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:04,765
Aah!

609
00:46:06,266 --> 00:46:09,520
I hope you're insured!

610
00:46:18,028 --> 00:46:21,031
Oh, well, why not?

611
00:46:36,088 --> 00:46:38,507
You're goin' down!

612
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:01,488
Hello?

613
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:03,782
Sie haben meine Hummer Gestolen!

614
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:06,368
I'm only borrowing your Humvee!

615
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:12,124
Information?

616
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:14,126
San Francisco?

617
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:17,296
Uh, Jade Angelou.
That's A-N-G...

618
00:47:19,548 --> 00:47:21,884
Welcome aboard, y'all.
How y'all doin' today?

619
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:26,180
Hang on!

620
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:32,269
Holy shit!

621
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:44,990
Whoa-oa!

622
00:47:46,742 --> 00:47:49,620
Oh, no!

623
00:47:53,624 --> 00:47:55,834
We're gonna crash!
Save yourselves!

624
00:48:01,465 --> 00:48:03,425
Oh, my baby!

625
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:10,140
Oh, no!

626
00:48:22,778 --> 00:48:25,614
Oh, no!

627
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,453
Oh, no! God!

628
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:34,832
Oh, God!

629
00:48:53,183 --> 00:48:56,603
Hey, man, you just fucked up
your Ferrari.

630
00:48:56,854 --> 00:48:59,940
- Oh, no! Baby's goin' down in flames!
- It's not mine.

631
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:02,401
Neither is this!

632
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:09,867
Damn! This sucks!
Where's that son of a bitch at?

633
00:49:10,033 --> 00:49:13,745
I'm gonna hunt him down!
That motherfucker ain't safe nowhere.

634
00:49:13,912 --> 00:49:16,373
Chem weapons. Isherwood.

635
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,918
Marvin, look up Wolfburg
Federal Penitentiary.

636
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,045
The inmate is Mason, John.

637
00:49:22,254 --> 00:49:25,048
Hey, Stan, listen, I'm gettin'
out of this government shithole.

638
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:28,135
I'm goin' over to Orkin to
design roach motels. Cool, huh?

639
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:30,137
Look, I just stole
a kid's motorcycle.

640
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:32,306
I'm not really feeling too good
about it, okay? Wolfburg. Got it?

641
00:49:32,514 --> 00:49:36,894
Yeah, I got it. All right,
Magrane, Masconi, Masters. No Mason.

642
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:41,732
Go to February '76. Who was transferred
to Wolfburg from San Quentin?

643
00:49:42,107 --> 00:49:43,942
This is weird.

644
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:47,905
They got medical records.
They got place of birth. Glasgow.

645
00:49:48,071 --> 00:49:49,990
Uh, but they don't have a name.

646
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:52,159
Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

647
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:56,914
They have next of kin. A Jade Angelou
of 32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco.

648
00:50:17,142 --> 00:50:19,019
Jade?

649
00:50:19,186 --> 00:50:23,148
No, Stacy. Jade's friend.

650
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:29,822
Were you afraid
to come alone?

651
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:32,157
Yeah.

652
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:34,451
It's okay.

653
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,120
I'll be over here if you need me.

654
00:50:37,329 --> 00:50:41,750
The last photograph I had of you,
you were about ten.

655
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:48,340
Well, I found a picture of you
among my mom's things when she died.

656
00:50:48,507 --> 00:50:51,343
Oh, yeah? Well, uh...

657
00:50:53,178 --> 00:50:57,683
- Why don't we take a walk?
- I got him. Palace of Fine Arts.

658
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:01,728
Your mother, uh... Yeah, well,
sh-she was very special.

659
00:51:01,979 --> 00:51:04,356
Yeah, she was.

660
00:51:04,523 --> 00:51:08,152
But I don't think we should romanticize
what happened between you and her.

661
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,904
Meeting in a bar
after a Led Zeppelin concert.

662
00:51:11,113 --> 00:51:14,366
Head out, and I was the result.

663
00:51:14,533 --> 00:51:17,911
Well, I'd like to think it
would've led somewhere if only...

664
00:51:18,078 --> 00:51:19,913
If only what?
Six federal marshals...

665
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,041
hadn't kicked down our door
and dragged you back to prison?

666
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,252
I'm sorry.

667
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,547
It's all right.

668
00:51:28,755 --> 00:51:31,633
- So, they let you out?
- Yeah.

669
00:51:32,843 --> 00:51:35,679
That's good.

670
00:51:35,888 --> 00:51:38,765
What did you do?

671
00:51:44,313 --> 00:51:48,066
Jade, I don't have
a great deal of time here.

672
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:54,615
But I'll be coming back.
And, uh, Maybe we can...

673
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:56,408
What? We can what?

674
00:51:58,076 --> 00:52:03,790
You know, you're almost
the only evidence that I exist.

675
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:06,376
But I don't know you.

676
00:52:06,585 --> 00:52:09,129
That's what I want to change, eh?

677
00:52:13,383 --> 00:52:17,888
I've rehearsed this speech a thousand
times on the chance that we would meet.

678
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:20,599
Here we are, and I'm lost.

679
00:52:20,807 --> 00:52:24,186
Well, I don't know how
I'm supposed to be feeling either.

680
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:27,773
Jade, I'm not an evil man.

681
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:31,443
If you can believe that,
then it's a start.

682
00:52:35,405 --> 00:52:37,115
Okay.

683
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:50,379
Is this about you?

684
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:06,353
You broke out of prison again,
didn't you?

685
00:53:06,562 --> 00:53:09,064
- Why did you come to me?
- FBI, ma'am.

686
00:53:09,231 --> 00:53:13,610
Your father's working with us. He's
helping us resolve a dangerous situation.

687
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:15,863
- He is?
- Yes, ma'am.

688
00:53:16,113 --> 00:53:19,366
Well, gee whiz, John,
I guess we oughta get goin', huh?

689
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:22,744
Whatever you say, Stanley.

690
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:30,335
Thank you for that.
You could've handled it differently.

691
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:33,797
What do you say we cut
the chitchat, a-hole?

692
00:53:33,964 --> 00:53:37,885
You almost got me killed twice.
And my jaw hurts like hell!

693
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:40,804
- Good.
- Cocksucker!

694
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:44,349
If I had my way, you would be shipped
back to Wolfburg in leg irons...

695
00:53:44,516 --> 00:53:46,894
and caged like an animal for the rest
of your natural fucking life!

696
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,896
You wrecked half the city!

697
00:53:52,774 --> 00:53:56,195
- Give me a hand with the system.
- Now, tell me about the tunnels.

698
00:53:56,403 --> 00:54:00,073
If you know the system, it will
take you wherever you need to go.

699
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,704
There's an intake pipe here,
below low tide. Is that our best access?

700
00:54:05,871 --> 00:54:09,166
- Yes. That's exactly where I had come out.
- Then beneath the cistern...

701
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:11,710
there's a connection
to the abandoned septic system.

702
00:54:11,877 --> 00:54:16,673
- How many feet is that?
- Ehh... 57 paces.

703
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,842
Where do we go from there?

704
00:54:21,762 --> 00:54:24,389
Where do we go from there?

705
00:54:24,598 --> 00:54:26,975
That's a good question.

706
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:32,356
- I have no idea.
- What?

707
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:35,776
I mean, I'll know it
when we're all inside.

708
00:54:35,943 --> 00:54:39,363
No. You're not goddamn goin'.
Show us on the blueprints.

709
00:54:39,613 --> 00:54:42,908
I can't! My blueprint
was in my head.

710
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:46,453
I was underground
for three days in the dark...

711
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,748
just waiting for the tides
to be right.

712
00:54:49,957 --> 00:54:52,000
But don't worry.
It'll all come back to me.

713
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:55,254
You're not going anywhere, Mason.

714
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:56,880
Wait a second.

715
00:54:57,089 --> 00:55:01,426
Now, this piece of work might be the only
chance those people over there have.

716
00:55:01,593 --> 00:55:04,304
If he's not going, then why the
hell did we get him out of jail?

717
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:07,599
- He's smart.
- I got him out to get you people in, not go with you.

718
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:11,645
If it's the only way of getting
the intelligence I need, then he goes.

719
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:13,647
He'll fuck with you.

720
00:55:13,814 --> 00:55:17,526
You compromise my men's lives,
and I'll bury you out there.

721
00:55:19,486 --> 00:55:24,324
Now, Womack... you're between
The Rock and a hard case.

722
00:55:25,742 --> 00:55:28,495
How is your bowling arm?

723
00:55:31,582 --> 00:55:33,625
Dr. Goodspeed, the goal is
to take out the launchers,

724
00:55:33,876 --> 00:55:35,878
then neutralize
the V. X. chemical rounds.

725
00:55:36,128 --> 00:55:38,630
Well, we know the poison's being
kept in the prison morgue...

726
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:42,217
from the satellite thermal imaging,
which is right here... these colorized dots.

727
00:55:42,384 --> 00:55:44,344
Have you ever actually seen
one of these devices?

728
00:55:44,553 --> 00:55:46,471
No, sir,
but I've studied them.

729
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:50,058
I should really begin briefing your guys
on defusing and detoxification.

730
00:55:50,267 --> 00:55:53,103
Got a really neat layout over here of
the chem round as well as the rocket...

731
00:55:53,270 --> 00:55:55,772
- so let's get rolling.
- That won't be necessary.

732
00:55:57,733 --> 00:56:00,277
Oh, it's very necessary, sir.

733
00:56:00,486 --> 00:56:03,280
The power of this chemical
is way beyond anything you can imagine.

734
00:56:03,489 --> 00:56:06,033
An ecological disaster, sir.

735
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:08,619
Plus the devices themselves
are complicated.

736
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:11,580
That's why you're
coming with us.

737
00:56:13,749 --> 00:56:14,875
I am?

738
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:18,253
You're the expert.
What's your problem?

739
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,591
You mean I'm going, going out there,
under the water?

740
00:56:22,758 --> 00:56:27,596
Well, earlier today you wanted a gun.
Now you're getting a gun and a wet suit.

741
00:56:27,804 --> 00:56:29,765
Have you ever been
in a combat situation?

742
00:56:29,973 --> 00:56:33,018
- Define "combat, " sir.
- Shep?

743
00:56:33,227 --> 00:56:36,021
An incursion underwater
to retake an impregnable fortress...

744
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:38,816
held by an elite team of U. S. Marines
in possession of 81 hostages...

745
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:42,569
and 15 guided rockets
armed with V. X. poisoned gas.

746
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:46,949
Oh. In that case, no, sir.
Excuse me.

747
00:56:53,497 --> 00:56:55,874
- Here.
- Ah, thank you.

748
00:56:58,252 --> 00:57:00,587
You don't look too good.

749
00:57:00,754 --> 00:57:03,298
In fact, you look like shit.

750
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:07,553
My stomach's doing hula hoops
around my ass.

751
00:57:07,761 --> 00:57:11,473
You all right? I mean,
you gonna make it through this thing?

752
00:57:11,682 --> 00:57:13,892
I don't know.

753
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:17,020
I always expected something
like this was going to happen...

754
00:57:17,187 --> 00:57:19,189
but nothing prepares you for it.

755
00:57:19,398 --> 00:57:22,526
Now I'm...
I'm responsible...

756
00:57:22,693 --> 00:57:25,279
for a whole city.

757
00:57:25,487 --> 00:57:29,324
Look, I Know this isn't easy for you.

758
00:57:29,491 --> 00:57:31,785
Remember, you were trained
for this kind of a situation...

759
00:57:31,952 --> 00:57:33,787
and believe me,
it'll come back to you.

760
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:36,540
Besides, you got the best SEAL team
in the country backing you up.

761
00:57:36,748 --> 00:57:40,085
Okay. You're right.

762
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:44,423
I'll be on the wire.
I'll help talk you through it.

763
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:49,011
There's something else.
It's terrible.

764
00:57:49,178 --> 00:57:53,056
No, it's wonderful...
except it isn't.

765
00:57:53,265 --> 00:57:56,894
My girlfriend's pregnant...

766
00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:01,231
and she's just flown in to see me.

767
00:58:01,398 --> 00:58:04,026
You keep your mind on what you're going
to be doing out there tonight.

768
00:58:04,234 --> 00:58:07,988
And I'll send someone to pick up your girlfriend
and bring her here to the command center.

769
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,795
Hummel!
- Hello, Frank. Lou Linstrom.

770
00:58:23,962 --> 00:58:27,633
I'm at the White House
with General Kramer.

771
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:31,595
Uh, Frank, uh, we're havin' a few
problems with the account transfer.

772
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,972
Don't tell me problems.
Tell me solutions.

773
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:38,393
Now, We've spoken to the president. and I know
that you're aware of his stance on terrorism.

774
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:42,731
- So what we'd like to do is...
- This isn't about terrorism. This is about justice.

775
00:58:42,898 --> 00:58:45,692
It's about reminding you people who
found it politically convenient to forget.

776
00:58:45,859 --> 00:58:49,738
- This is goin' nowhere, Frank.
- Well, then, let me tell you what is.

777
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:52,658
Fifteen V. X. gas rockets
into the heart of San Francisco.

778
00:58:52,866 --> 00:58:54,910
You've got 17 hours
to deliver the money.

779
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:57,746
Or be prepared to reap
the whirlwind, gentlemen.

780
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:04,044
What's the word from Mojave?

781
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:08,882
General Peterson can give us no definite
assurance on the thermite plasma.

782
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:11,009
That is the word.

783
00:59:15,764 --> 00:59:17,641
Green light to SEAL incursion.

784
00:59:35,784 --> 00:59:37,703
Fall in!

785
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:41,415
All right, listen up.
Mr. Mason will run point for us.

786
00:59:41,623 --> 00:59:43,625
Lieutenant Shepard
will be attached to his hip.

787
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:48,338
You breathe, he breathes with you.
You piss, he helps. Understood?

788
00:59:50,007 --> 00:59:53,051
Dr. Goodspeed is our specialist.
When he neutralizes the threat,

789
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:56,972
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

790
00:59:57,181 --> 01:00:00,934
Make no mistake, gentlemen.
We're in the fight of our lives...

791
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:03,103
against maybe the greatest
battalion commander...

792
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:05,272
in the Vietnam War.
I shit you not.

793
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:09,318
Any questions?

794
01:00:09,485 --> 01:00:10,360
Let's load up!

795
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:22,748
After you, ace.

796
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:47,898
Pass out and activate
the minicams.

797
01:00:48,065 --> 01:00:50,400
Everything set here?

798
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:53,070
Minicams operational?

799
01:00:53,278 --> 01:00:56,365
Roger that, sir.
We are on-line.

800
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:04,289
Shep, what's the status on the special
operational gear for Mr. Mason?

801
01:01:07,626 --> 01:01:09,461
Uh, let's see.
We have, uh...

802
01:01:09,628 --> 01:01:13,507
one quart of kerosene
in a squeeze bottle.

803
01:01:15,717 --> 01:01:21,306
Three washers and waterproof matches.

804
01:01:21,515 --> 01:01:24,768
Use the green flares to signal
when the threat has been neutralized.

805
01:01:24,977 --> 01:01:27,980
Now, this is atropine.
If you come in contact with the gas...

806
01:01:28,188 --> 01:01:30,440
you have 20 seconds
to inject it into your heart.

807
01:01:30,649 --> 01:01:32,985
Don't fuck with me on this.
It may save your life.

808
01:01:36,655 --> 01:01:42,119
I have three incoming bogeys
bearing 275. Range: 6, 000 meters.

809
01:01:45,664 --> 01:01:48,000
FBI Command Center?

810
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:51,253
- Oh, I would just love for you
to tell me what is goin' on.

811
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:53,672
- Nope.
- Stanley Goodspeed is my boyfriend.

812
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:57,634
- -Actually, he's, um, my fiance.
Where is he? - Classified, lady.

813
01:01:57,801 --> 01:02:00,679
Okay. Well, you just sit here
and act like a Bureau bonehead, then.

814
01:02:00,846 --> 01:02:02,931
Hey, where are you g...
Goddamn it!

815
01:02:08,061 --> 01:02:10,564
Decoy choppers
commencing run to Alcatraz.

816
01:02:12,441 --> 01:02:14,485
I just lost one, sir.
I just lost one.

817
01:02:14,735 --> 01:02:17,279
We only got two flying in.
I just lost one.

818
01:02:17,488 --> 01:02:18,572
Shit!

819
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:31,835
In my day, we did it all
with a snorkel and a pair of flippers.

820
01:02:32,002 --> 01:02:35,005
- Your day?
- Yes. Didn't you read my resume?

821
01:02:35,214 --> 01:02:38,008
I don't...
I don't know anything about you.

822
01:02:38,175 --> 01:02:40,928
- Hmm. I know something about you, Godspell.
- Goodspeed.

823
01:02:41,094 --> 01:02:44,097
Goodspeed, Godspeed,
Godspell...

824
01:02:44,264 --> 01:02:47,559
you never went to
any antiterrorist school.

825
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:50,562
So just make sure you don't
get us all fucking killed.

826
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,610
- We're goin' dark.
- Night vision!

827
01:02:58,278 --> 01:03:00,697
Raider One has dropped
below radar coverage...

828
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:03,992
heading around Treasure Island. heading around
Treasure Island. heading around Treasure Island.

829
01:03:04,201 --> 01:03:07,496
Sir, we've got two bogeys
bearing due east and closing.

830
01:03:12,543 --> 01:03:14,461
Decoys?

831
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:17,589
- Prepare to deploy!
- Good luck, Commander.

832
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:24,638
Sir, Raider One
is at the drop zone.

833
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:30,102
Stanley's not a very good swimmer.
I mean, he can't even snorkel.

834
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:33,647
- Everyone, good to go?
- Good to go!

835
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:37,484
- Good to go!
- Good to go! Good to go!

836
01:03:46,243 --> 01:03:49,705
so the S. D. U. s have been deployed,
and the Eagles are in the water.

837
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:02,926
Major, I want the perimeter patrolled
to the west end of the island.

838
01:04:03,093 --> 01:04:05,012
Yes, sir. Hendrix!
You lead the patrol.

839
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:08,557
Aye, aye, sir.
Let's move. Move out!

840
01:05:05,489 --> 01:05:08,826
The Eagles are on The Rock.
They've entered the cistern room.

841
01:05:14,081 --> 01:05:19,795
Thank you very fucking much, Mr. Mason.
You've led us into a room with no exit.

842
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:24,967
Any ideas, Dillinger?

843
01:05:25,133 --> 01:05:27,678
Figure it out soon.
We're sitting ducks.

844
01:05:27,886 --> 01:05:31,765
We're a little tight on time. You
stand by the door until I open it.

845
01:05:31,932 --> 01:05:35,018
I'd like to know how you plan
on accomplishing that?

846
01:05:35,227 --> 01:05:36,979
Through here.

847
01:05:43,569 --> 01:05:45,404
You're shitting me.

848
01:05:45,571 --> 01:05:49,324
I memorized the timing.
I just hope it hasn't been changed.

849
01:05:49,491 --> 01:05:53,036
You catch one of those flame bursts,
you're a corpse.

850
01:05:53,287 --> 01:05:56,415
- Thank you. - Commander, you said
never to leave his sight, but, uh...

851
01:05:56,623 --> 01:06:01,503
- Stand fast, Lieutenant.
- Have a nice day.

852
01:06:23,984 --> 01:06:27,696
- Where'd you dig up this guy?
- That's classified.

853
01:06:34,953 --> 01:06:37,998
Clear here, sir.
No motion sensors tripped.

854
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:41,752
- Nothing.
- Well, tell 'em to stay out there.

855
01:06:42,002 --> 01:06:44,171
Sweep forward!

856
01:06:53,013 --> 01:06:54,973
Looks like he fucked us,
Commander.

857
01:06:55,182 --> 01:06:58,977
I knew it.
That son of a bitch jumped ship.

858
01:07:04,274 --> 01:07:06,318
Welcome to The Rock.

859
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:25,337
- Mason.
- That's a no-no. That's the subway.

860
01:07:25,462 --> 01:07:28,882
- That'll drop you into the tunnels.
- Do it!

861
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:50,028
Sir, the Eagles have breached
the tunnel system.

862
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:58,787
You enjoying this?

863
01:07:58,996 --> 01:08:01,999
Well, it's certainly more enjoyable
than my average day.

864
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:06,128
Reading philosophy,
avoiding gang rape in the washroom.

865
01:08:06,336 --> 01:08:10,632
Though it's less of a problem these
days. Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal.

866
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:18,390
We've got seismic activity
in one of the storm grates. North side.

867
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,310
Continue patrolling the area.

868
01:08:21,518 --> 01:08:24,563
Sweep forward!

869
01:08:24,771 --> 01:08:27,983
Commander, halt.
We've got movement.

870
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:30,527
They're hearing sounds above, sir.

871
01:08:30,694 --> 01:08:34,406
Stand fast.

872
01:08:39,745 --> 01:08:42,247
West storm drain's clear.

873
01:08:46,752 --> 01:08:50,339
Ninety-seven paces
to the shower room.

874
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,846
The Eagles are now at the access tunnel.
They're right under the shower room, sir.

875
01:09:05,062 --> 01:09:06,563
Fiber optics.

876
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:14,029
- Something's not right.
- I got a bad feeling about this.

877
01:09:33,006 --> 01:09:35,008
Quiet.

878
01:09:45,477 --> 01:09:48,188
Motion sensors.

879
01:09:48,355 --> 01:09:52,526
- Beams cutting across the manhole covers.
- Deal with it.

880
01:09:56,989 --> 01:10:00,868
Commander, the beam is hitting
some sort of reflective device.

881
01:10:01,201 --> 01:10:02,911
Possibly a prism.

882
01:10:05,205 --> 01:10:08,500
I want to use a mirror
to cut the beam...

883
01:10:08,667 --> 01:10:11,670
send the beam back to its source...

884
01:10:11,879 --> 01:10:13,839
and then I'm gonna move the prism.

885
01:10:18,135 --> 01:10:20,512
We've got motion on a trembler
in the shower room, sir.

886
01:10:20,721 --> 01:10:22,806
We've got visitors.
Let's move.

887
01:10:25,851 --> 01:10:28,729
Got it.
Good to go.

888
01:10:33,859 --> 01:10:35,986
Stand fast.
We'll secure the area.

889
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:50,375
They're entering
into the shower room, sir.

890
01:10:53,045 --> 01:10:55,506
They're securing the area.

891
01:11:03,931 --> 01:11:06,725
Just sit tight.

892
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:12,356
Drop your weapons!
Drop 'em!

893
01:11:12,564 --> 01:11:14,608
- Stand fast!
- Hold your fire!

894
01:11:14,817 --> 01:11:16,777
- Drop your weapons!
- Hold your fire!

895
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,365
It's a fucking trap.

896
01:11:23,534 --> 01:11:27,079
This is General Hummel.
Drop your weapons.

897
01:11:27,246 --> 01:11:28,914
Drop 'em!

898
01:11:29,081 --> 01:11:34,670
Anderson here, General
Hummel. Commander. Team leader.

899
01:11:34,837 --> 01:11:37,798
Commander Anderson, if you have any
concern for the lives of your men...

900
01:11:37,965 --> 01:11:40,884
you will order them to safety their
weapons and place them on the deck.

901
01:11:41,134 --> 01:11:42,386
This is not happening.

902
01:11:42,594 --> 01:11:47,933
Sir, we know why you're out here.
God knows I agree with you.

903
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:52,187
But like you, I swore to defend
this country against all enemies...

904
01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:56,400
foreign, sir, and domestic.

905
01:11:56,567 --> 01:12:00,946
General, we've spilled
the same blood in the same mud.

906
01:12:01,113 --> 01:12:03,949
You know goddamn well
I can't give that order.

907
01:12:04,116 --> 01:12:05,617
We're dead.

908
01:12:05,784 --> 01:12:09,121
Your unit is covered
from an elevated position, Commander.

909
01:12:09,329 --> 01:12:12,958
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Don't do anything stupid.

910
01:12:13,167 --> 01:12:15,544
No one has to die here.

911
01:12:15,711 --> 01:12:19,965
Men following the general, you're
under oath as United States Marines!

912
01:12:20,174 --> 01:12:21,967
Have you forgotten that?

913
01:12:23,302 --> 01:12:25,345
We all have shipmates
we remember.

914
01:12:25,554 --> 01:12:28,807
Some of them were shit on
and pissed on by the Pentagon.

915
01:12:28,974 --> 01:12:32,019
But that doesn't give you
the right to mutiny!

916
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,730
You call it what you want!
You're down there, we're up here.

917
01:12:34,938 --> 01:12:36,732
You walked into the wrong
goddamn room, Commander!

918
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,942
- Stand fast!
- Goddamn it, Commander, one last time.

919
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:40,986
You tell your men to safety
their weapons, drop 'em on the deck.

920
01:12:41,153 --> 01:12:43,822
- I cannot give that order!
- I am not gonna repeat that order!

921
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:46,825
- I will not give that order!
- What the hell is wrong with you, man?

922
01:12:46,992 --> 01:12:49,411
- Stand fast!
- Oh, my God!

923
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:51,497
- Let's waste these fuckers.
- One last time.

924
01:12:51,663 --> 01:12:56,168
You order your
men to safety their weapons...

925
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:02,716
Cease fire!

926
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:28,325
Cease fire!

927
01:13:37,334 --> 01:13:39,127
Cease fire!

928
01:13:39,294 --> 01:13:43,465
Shit, goddamn it.
Let go of me, let go of me!

929
01:13:43,674 --> 01:13:46,009
Don't, don't go.

930
01:14:23,714 --> 01:14:24,840
Fuck

931
01:14:35,434 --> 01:14:37,227
It's over.

932
01:14:47,029 --> 01:14:49,406
Oh, God!

933
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:21,522
We got some movement.

934
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:24,733
- Who? Who is it?
- Two of'em. Eagles 11 and 12.

935
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,569
- It's Goodspeed and Mason.
- I knew it.

936
01:15:27,736 --> 01:15:30,739
I've gotta get a team together right now.
We've gotta move with the second option.

937
01:15:30,948 --> 01:15:32,950
What, and invite
another massacre? No way.

938
01:15:33,158 --> 01:15:37,079
We've got a 60-year-old convict and
a lab rat. I'm telling you, it's over.

939
01:15:37,287 --> 01:15:39,790
Not for Mason, it isn't.

940
01:15:51,343 --> 01:15:55,347
Goodspeed, I'm not gonna kill you.

941
01:15:58,058 --> 01:16:00,686
- Where are you going?
- Off this bloody island.

942
01:16:00,853 --> 01:16:02,813
What? Wh-Wh-What for?

943
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:06,483
Goodspeed.
Goodspeed, do you read me?

944
01:16:06,692 --> 01:16:09,027
It's for you.

945
01:16:10,571 --> 01:16:12,990
- Sir?
- What's the status?

946
01:16:13,157 --> 01:16:15,659
The status is they're dead.
They're dead!

947
01:16:15,784 --> 01:16:17,953
It's just me and Mason.
Now he says he's leaving.

948
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:21,456
That is unacceptable.
Do you hear me? Unacceptable!

949
01:16:21,623 --> 01:16:24,877
Well, there's a problem, sir.
He's got a gun.

950
01:16:25,043 --> 01:16:26,920
What do you have,
a fuckin' water pistol?

951
01:16:27,087 --> 01:16:30,883
- No, sir.
- Go after him and stop him.

952
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:35,220
I didn't want this.

953
01:16:35,387 --> 01:16:37,973
- Jesus, I didn't want this.
- You knew this might happen, Frank.

954
01:16:38,182 --> 01:16:41,185
- Well, maybe now they'll pay up.
- Maybe now they won't, Captain.

955
01:16:41,393 --> 01:16:43,812
Then maybe we need to execute
a few hostages.

956
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:46,648
- Got a live one!
- Put a bullet in him.

957
01:16:46,815 --> 01:16:48,734
You heard him. End it!

958
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:50,819
Holster that sidearm, Captain.

959
01:17:09,338 --> 01:17:11,298
Sir?

960
01:17:14,718 --> 01:17:19,556
You made a terrible mistake. And more
of our brothers have died in vain.

961
01:17:19,723 --> 01:17:23,685
Damn you for forcing me
into this position.

962
01:17:26,855 --> 01:17:29,691
I need to talk to you
right now, alone.

963
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:32,110
Now you told me
I'm on a need-to-know basis.

964
01:17:32,277 --> 01:17:34,404
And I'm tellin' you right now,
I need to know...

965
01:17:34,571 --> 01:17:37,783
who the fuck
John Mason is right now, sir.

966
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:41,829
All right, you wanna know?
1962, J. Edgar Hoover...

967
01:17:41,995 --> 01:17:44,665
is head of the FBI,
some say the country.

968
01:17:44,873 --> 01:17:48,752
It's no secret he kept microfilm files
on prominent Americans and Europeans:

969
01:17:48,919 --> 01:17:52,297
de Gaulle, British members
of Parliament, even the prime minister.

970
01:17:52,506 --> 01:17:55,717
I mean, this guy had dirt
on everybody in the world.

971
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:59,304
Yeah, I know all the cloak-and-dagger
stories. Where does Mason fit in?

972
01:17:59,471 --> 01:18:02,141
Mason was the British operative
who stole the files.

973
01:18:02,307 --> 01:18:04,977
But our Bureau agents caught him
at the Canadian border.

974
01:18:05,144 --> 01:18:08,272
Of course, the British claimed
they'd never heard of him.

975
01:18:08,438 --> 01:18:12,901
And we held him without trial
until he gave up the microfilm,

976
01:18:13,068 --> 01:18:14,945
but he never did.

977
01:18:15,112 --> 01:18:18,282
Well, I'm surprised Hoover
didn't use his daughter as leverage.

978
01:18:18,448 --> 01:18:21,285
Hoover was dead in '72.
She wasn't born yet.

979
01:18:21,493 --> 01:18:24,872
Today, well, it's
a different Bureau.

980
01:18:25,038 --> 01:18:29,251
So you held this guy without trial
his whole life! No wonder he's pissed.

981
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:33,672
This man knows our most intimate secrets
from the last half century:

982
01:18:33,839 --> 01:18:38,635
the alien landing at Roswell, the truth
about the J. F. K. assassination.

983
01:18:38,844 --> 01:18:42,681
And Mason's angry, he's lethal,
he's a trained killer.

984
01:18:42,848 --> 01:18:47,644
And he is the only hope
that we have got.

985
01:18:47,978 --> 01:18:52,107
Mason! Mason!

986
01:18:52,316 --> 01:18:55,277
There are 81 hostages
still up there.

987
01:18:55,486 --> 01:18:57,196
Yeah, like me.

988
01:18:57,362 --> 01:18:59,907
All right, you wanna play tough?
You wanna play tough with me?

989
01:19:00,073 --> 01:19:02,868
Okay. FBI!
Freeze, sucker!

990
01:19:04,203 --> 01:19:08,248
- I'll fire.
- No, you won't.

991
01:19:08,415 --> 01:19:12,836
- Throw down.
- You're not the sort.

992
01:19:13,003 --> 01:19:14,838
Let's find out.

993
01:19:18,383 --> 01:19:21,011
I could; you, no.

994
01:19:21,178 --> 01:19:24,348
Besides, your safety's on.

995
01:19:24,556 --> 01:19:28,018
Goodspeed, have you
resolved the situation?

996
01:19:28,227 --> 01:19:31,563
Not yet.

997
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:36,902
- He's got all the guns now, sir.
- Shit!

998
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:40,072
You're right, I don't use guns
and I don't kick down doors.

999
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:42,407
- This is what I do.
- I haven't got my glasses.

1000
01:19:42,574 --> 01:19:46,745
What it says
is Chemical Weapons Specialist.

1001
01:19:46,912 --> 01:19:48,288
That's right.

1002
01:19:48,455 --> 01:19:51,583
I got a lunatic up there,
man with 15 missiles...

1003
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:53,627
armed with some really funky stuff.

1004
01:19:53,794 --> 01:19:59,258
That lying Womack.
You could've told my daughter.

1005
01:19:59,466 --> 01:20:03,929
It was classified.
Look, I'm in the same situation.

1006
01:20:04,138 --> 01:20:07,266
They've got my girlfriend in
the city with a baby on the way.

1007
01:20:07,432 --> 01:20:10,853
Look, I can defuse the rockets.
I really can.

1008
01:20:10,978 --> 01:20:14,565
But I'm gonna need your help,
and I'm gonna need it right now.

1009
01:20:22,281 --> 01:20:24,992
Sir, this man's weapons
and tack radio are missing!

1010
01:20:25,159 --> 01:20:28,162
Shit, we got a rodent problem.
Flush the pipes.

1011
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:30,873
There's probably a maze of
tunnels on this goddamn island.

1012
01:20:31,081 --> 01:20:33,625
- Check every access you can find.
- Sir!

1013
01:20:39,506 --> 01:20:41,925
Even if you escape
from the island...

1014
01:20:42,050 --> 01:20:44,845
you can't escape
the rockets.

1015
01:20:45,053 --> 01:20:47,306
So, where are you gonna go?

1016
01:20:47,473 --> 01:20:50,142
Go where?
What are, what are you gonna do?

1017
01:20:52,978 --> 01:20:55,147
Show me where the morgue is, Mason.

1018
01:20:55,314 --> 01:20:57,483
I'm out of here.

1019
01:20:59,651 --> 01:21:02,654
What about your daughter? Mason?

1020
01:21:04,698 --> 01:21:06,074
Rodents located.

1021
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:10,204
The way I see it, you don't
really have any choice, do you?

1022
01:21:10,454 --> 01:21:12,581
I don't think you do.

1023
01:21:24,092 --> 01:21:27,805
Move!

1024
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:32,392
Ooooh!

1025
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:55,541
- They're onto us.
- Burn 'em out.

1026
01:21:57,793 --> 01:21:59,962
This mother's gonna blow big.

1027
01:22:41,170 --> 01:22:45,132
I don't understand. How could
we lose radio contact all of a sudden?

1028
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:47,843
We've lost coms.
Still got 'em on locaters.

1029
01:22:55,767 --> 01:22:59,021
- So what's it gonna be?
- What?

1030
01:22:59,188 --> 01:23:03,484
- How do you like your choices?
- I don't.

1031
01:23:03,650 --> 01:23:07,279
That's what I thought.

1032
01:23:07,446 --> 01:23:09,281
All right, come on.

1033
01:23:09,448 --> 01:23:12,117
This is the oldest part
of Alcatraz.

1034
01:23:12,326 --> 01:23:15,787
Did you know it was originally
a Civil War fort?

1035
01:23:15,996 --> 01:23:18,957
Oh, really? Huh. Yeah, wow.
You know, I like history, too...

1036
01:23:19,124 --> 01:23:22,127
and maybe when this is all over, you and
I can stop by the souvenir shop together.

1037
01:23:22,336 --> 01:23:26,632
But right now I just... I just...
I wanna find some rockets.

1038
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:29,802
Don't tempt me.

1039
01:23:29,968 --> 01:23:33,430
We are going to the morgue.

1040
01:23:55,536 --> 01:23:58,789
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'll do my best.

1041
01:23:58,956 --> 01:24:01,375
Your best?

1042
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:04,920
Losers always whine
about their best.

1043
01:24:05,087 --> 01:24:08,924
Winners go home
and fuck the prom queen.

1044
01:24:10,551 --> 01:24:12,386
Carla was the prom queen.

1045
01:24:12,553 --> 01:24:16,056
- Really?
- Yeah.

1046
01:24:17,808 --> 01:24:20,561
Locaters have them
approaching the morgue, sir.

1047
01:24:20,769 --> 01:24:23,230
Come on, come on.
You can do it, Doc.

1048
01:24:27,317 --> 01:24:30,988
Shit! Aaaaaah!

1049
01:24:31,155 --> 01:24:33,657
You must never hesitate. You must
never hesitate. You must never hesitate.

1050
01:24:56,763 --> 01:24:59,475
I think you're shooting
too close to the rocket.

1051
01:24:59,683 --> 01:25:01,935
Him, but not the rocket.

1052
01:25:02,102 --> 01:25:04,730
Any other news, Professor?

1053
01:25:06,315 --> 01:25:09,776
Not the rocket!
Not the rocket.

1054
01:25:16,492 --> 01:25:18,577
Aaah! Uhhh!

1055
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:26,502
Not the rocket! Not the rocket.
I got a little somethin' for ya.

1056
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:38,555
Yaaaah!

1057
01:25:49,942 --> 01:25:53,946
Oh, yeah, okay. That's just about
the most awful thing I've ever seen.

1058
01:25:55,823 --> 01:26:01,995
Mason... the second you don't
respect this, it kills you.

1059
01:26:02,162 --> 01:26:03,997
Put it over there.

1060
01:26:15,175 --> 01:26:17,970
You've been around a lot
of corpses. Is that normal?

1061
01:26:18,137 --> 01:26:21,306
- What, the feet thing?
- Yeah, the feet thing.

1062
01:26:21,473 --> 01:26:25,936
- Yeah, that happens.
- Can you do something about it?

1063
01:26:26,103 --> 01:26:28,689
Well, like what?
Kill him again?

1064
01:26:28,856 --> 01:26:31,191
Listen, I'm just a biochemist.

1065
01:26:31,358 --> 01:26:35,612
And most of the time I work in a glass
jar and lead a very uneventful life.

1066
01:26:35,779 --> 01:26:39,449
I drive a Volvo, a beige one.
But what I'm dealing with here...

1067
01:26:39,658 --> 01:26:43,162
is one of the most deadly substances
the Earth has ever known.

1068
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:45,706
So what do you say you cut me
some friggin' slack?

1069
01:27:02,055 --> 01:27:03,974
A really elegant
string-of-pearls configuration.

1070
01:27:04,141 --> 01:27:06,852
Unfortunately,
incredibly unstable.

1071
01:27:07,019 --> 01:27:09,021
Well, what exactly
does this stuff do?

1072
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:13,192
If the rocket renders it aerosol, it can
take out the entire city of people.

1073
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:17,696
Really? And what happens
if you drop one?

1074
01:27:17,863 --> 01:27:20,741
Happily, it'll just wipe out
you and me.

1075
01:27:20,908 --> 01:27:24,203
- How?
- It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

1076
01:27:24,328 --> 01:27:27,539
It stops the brain from sending nerve messages
down the spinal cord within 30 seconds.

1077
01:27:27,748 --> 01:27:30,709
Any epidermal exposure
or inhalation, and you'll know.

1078
01:27:30,918 --> 01:27:35,547
A twinge at the small of your back as
the poison seizes your nervous system.

1079
01:27:35,714 --> 01:27:37,257
Do not move that!

1080
01:27:39,843 --> 01:27:42,846
Your muscles freeze,
you can't breathe.

1081
01:27:43,055 --> 01:27:45,974
You spasm so hard you break
your own back, spit your guts out.

1082
01:27:46,183 --> 01:27:51,605
- But that's after your skin melts off.
- My God.

1083
01:27:51,814 --> 01:27:55,067
Oh, I think we'd like God
on our side at the moment, don't you?

1084
01:27:55,192 --> 01:27:59,446
So what I'm doing now is removing
the guidance system chips...

1085
01:27:59,655 --> 01:28:02,950
so the rocket will splash down
after 500 feet.

1086
01:28:03,116 --> 01:28:06,078
All right, let me have that.
You can let go of it.

1087
01:28:06,245 --> 01:28:08,831
All right,
just back away. Just back away!

1088
01:28:08,997 --> 01:28:12,626
Sir, morgue team
has not checked in.

1089
01:28:14,837 --> 01:28:16,880
Blackbird One,
this is Blackbird. Over.

1090
01:28:17,089 --> 01:28:21,802
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird.
Come in, goddamn it!

1091
01:28:24,054 --> 01:28:27,558
Somebody's still there.
Let's move!

1092
01:28:27,724 --> 01:28:30,018
Rats alive! Close on the morgue.
Close on the morgue.

1093
01:28:30,144 --> 01:28:32,062
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go.

1094
01:28:32,229 --> 01:28:35,566
Frye, Darrow, hustle up.
We got more company!

1095
01:28:39,194 --> 01:28:43,866
Hold it. Converge on
the morgue. Move out.

1096
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:47,327
Goodspeed, come on.
Come over here.

1097
01:28:47,494 --> 01:28:50,914
Good. I love pressure.
I eat it for breakfast.

1098
01:28:51,081 --> 01:28:52,624
Come on. Time's up.

1099
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:55,919
There's three rockets somewhere else.
We have to find them.

1100
01:28:58,464 --> 01:28:59,214
Come on!

1101
01:28:59,423 --> 01:29:00,924
Come on!

1102
01:29:18,358 --> 01:29:19,776
Clear!

1103
01:29:22,946 --> 01:29:26,283
- I'm too old for this.
- Where's it go?

1104
01:29:26,450 --> 01:29:28,535
I've no idea.

1105
01:29:28,744 --> 01:29:31,246
Sir, all the guidance chips
are gone.

1106
01:29:31,455 --> 01:29:34,374
Captain, I guess you didn't
quite take care of the rat problem.

1107
01:29:34,541 --> 01:29:35,959
No, sir.

1108
01:29:36,084 --> 01:29:38,921
Well, there are two dead men here who
strongly suggest you go finish the job.

1109
01:29:39,087 --> 01:29:41,590
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir!

1110
01:29:49,973 --> 01:29:53,519
- You really don't know where this goes?
- No, I don't know where it goes.

1111
01:29:53,685 --> 01:29:56,897
Well, it's starting to pick up speed.
Do you know how to slow it down?

1112
01:29:57,105 --> 01:29:58,482
No, I don't.

1113
01:30:07,199 --> 01:30:09,493
Aaaaah!

1114
01:30:11,203 --> 01:30:13,914
Uhhh!

1115
01:30:25,134 --> 01:30:26,677
God.

1116
01:30:34,059 --> 01:30:38,230
Mason, you all right?

1117
01:30:38,397 --> 01:30:41,859
Yes, perfectly okay,
you fucking idiot!

1118
01:30:43,902 --> 01:30:45,863
They're coming.

1119
01:30:46,071 --> 01:30:48,532
- Who?
- The marines!

1120
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:49,783
Where?

1121
01:31:51,887 --> 01:31:55,098
- What the fuck's goin' on?
- Let's cut him off.

1122
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:19,790
Mason!

1123
01:32:23,418 --> 01:32:25,629
Mason!

1124
01:33:40,913 --> 01:33:46,376
You motherfucker!
Die! Die! Die!

1125
01:34:06,897 --> 01:34:10,234
I'm rather glad
you didn't hesitate too long.

1126
01:34:13,362 --> 01:34:17,282
How do you do it?

1127
01:34:17,449 --> 01:34:23,038
Oh, I was trained by the best.
British Intelligence.

1128
01:34:23,205 --> 01:34:25,958
Come on.

1129
01:34:26,166 --> 01:34:31,130
But in retrospect, I'd rather
have been a poet or a farmer.

1130
01:34:31,296 --> 01:34:33,257
Okay.

1131
01:34:37,469 --> 01:34:40,722
Okay, the president arrives
in three hours.

1132
01:34:40,889 --> 01:34:45,018
His directive is to string Hummel along
until the air strike is operational.

1133
01:34:45,185 --> 01:34:47,229
What's the word from Mohave, General?

1134
01:34:47,396 --> 01:34:52,317
The same as last time, Lou.
They're going as fast as they can.

1135
01:34:56,488 --> 01:35:00,784
Do it over here.
On your knees. On your knees!

1136
01:35:10,794 --> 01:35:14,047
Navy SEALs, listen up. You've got
something that belongs to me.

1137
01:35:14,214 --> 01:35:16,550
Twelve guidance chips,
to be precise.

1138
01:35:16,717 --> 01:35:21,305
Let me remind you there are
lives at stake, civilian lives.

1139
01:35:21,472 --> 01:35:23,140
Speak up.

1140
01:35:23,307 --> 01:35:26,185
- Speak up!
- I, uh, uh...

1141
01:35:26,351 --> 01:35:28,187
Tell them your name.

1142
01:35:28,353 --> 01:35:30,439
My name is Larry Henderson.

1143
01:35:30,606 --> 01:35:32,191
Oh, man.

1144
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:35,194
And I'm a father of three.

1145
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:38,071
they've got a gun
to my head.

1146
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:41,992
You've got exactly three minutes
to return the guidance chips

1147
01:35:42,117 --> 01:35:44,745
or Mr. Henderson won't have a head.

1148
01:35:44,953 --> 01:35:47,623
Oh, no.
Hey. What...?

1149
01:35:47,789 --> 01:35:53,587
Now, three to go.
You find them and defuse them,

1150
01:35:53,796 --> 01:35:57,633
- okay? All right.
- All right.

1151
01:35:57,800 --> 01:36:01,094
I'll try and delay Hummel
and give you more time.

1152
01:36:01,261 --> 01:36:04,348
Hey, what about
Mr. Henderson's head?

1153
01:36:06,642 --> 01:36:09,520
Okay? What do you mean?

1154
01:36:14,483 --> 01:36:15,943
Okay.

1155
01:36:29,206 --> 01:36:32,584
- General.
- Who the hell are you?

1156
01:36:34,545 --> 01:36:36,839
I'm all that's left
of the enemy.

1157
01:36:51,019 --> 01:36:52,521
Bingo.

1158
01:37:01,446 --> 01:37:03,282
Stand easy.

1159
01:37:06,076 --> 01:37:10,414
Thought I'd been in the service
a long time.

1160
01:37:10,581 --> 01:37:14,710
- Name and rank, sailor.
- Well, it's army, actually.

1161
01:37:14,918 --> 01:37:19,047
Answer the question.
And address him as "General, sir".

1162
01:37:20,340 --> 01:37:23,469
Captain John Patrick Mason,
General, sir...

1163
01:37:23,594 --> 01:37:25,637
of Her Majesty's S. A. S.

1164
01:37:25,804 --> 01:37:27,431
Retired, of course.

1165
01:37:31,435 --> 01:37:34,104
You're a long way
from home, Captain.

1166
01:37:34,271 --> 01:37:36,857
How the hell are you
involved in this?

1167
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:39,610
Oh, I have a unique knowledge
of this prison facility.

1168
01:37:39,776 --> 01:37:42,654
I was, uh, formerly a guest here.

1169
01:37:56,668 --> 01:37:59,171
Hi, sweetie.

1170
01:38:06,011 --> 01:38:08,472
Hey, come back here, little boy.

1171
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:13,227
Did they bother to tell you
who I am, why I'm doing this?

1172
01:38:13,393 --> 01:38:16,355
Or are they just using you
like they do everybody else?

1173
01:38:16,522 --> 01:38:20,192
All I know is you were big in Vietnam.
I saw the highlights on television.

1174
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:24,029
You wouldn't have any fucking idea what it means to
lead some of the finest men on God's earth into battle,

1175
01:38:24,196 --> 01:38:26,406
and then see their memory betrayed
by their own fuckin' government.

1176
01:38:26,573 --> 01:38:31,411
I don't quite see how you cherish the memory
of the dead by killing another million.

1177
01:38:31,578 --> 01:38:35,332
And, uh, this is not combat.

1178
01:38:35,499 --> 01:38:39,711
It's an act of lunacy, General, sir.

1179
01:38:39,878 --> 01:38:42,506
Personally, I think
you're a fuckin' idiot.

1180
01:38:48,846 --> 01:38:51,390
"The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time...

1181
01:38:51,598 --> 01:38:54,768
with the blood of patriots
and tyrants." Thomas Jefferson.

1182
01:38:54,977 --> 01:38:59,731
"Patriotism is the virtue of
the vicious, " according to Oscar Wilde.

1183
01:39:04,778 --> 01:39:06,697
Thank you for making my point.

1184
01:39:06,864 --> 01:39:11,118
Where are the guidance chips?
Where are the guidance chips?

1185
01:39:11,285 --> 01:39:13,453
I destroyed them.

1186
01:39:13,620 --> 01:39:15,455
That was a bad move, soldier.

1187
01:39:15,622 --> 01:39:18,459
Does that mean
you'll execute us both?

1188
01:39:46,445 --> 01:39:49,948
You're lucky that old man Hummel
wants you alive.

1189
01:39:50,115 --> 01:39:52,242
'Cause I'll take pleasure
in guttin' you, boy.

1190
01:39:59,041 --> 01:40:04,046
I'd take pleasure
in guttin' you... boy!

1191
01:40:04,254 --> 01:40:09,718
"I'll take pleasure
in guttin' you, boy."

1192
01:40:09,843 --> 01:40:11,637
What is wrong
with these people, huh, Mason?

1193
01:40:11,804 --> 01:40:15,849
Don't you think there's a lot of, uh, a
lot of anger floating around this island?

1194
01:40:16,016 --> 01:40:19,186
Kind of a pubescent volatility?
Don't you think?

1195
01:40:19,353 --> 01:40:23,482
A lot of angst, a lot of, "I'm 16,
I'm angry at my father" syndrome?

1196
01:40:23,649 --> 01:40:25,901
I mean, grow up!
We're stuck on an island...

1197
01:40:26,109 --> 01:40:28,946
with a bunch of violence-for-pleasure
seeking psychopathic marines.

1198
01:40:29,112 --> 01:40:31,740
Shame on them!

1199
01:40:34,201 --> 01:40:37,371
Anyway, I only got one chem round.
There's two left.

1200
01:40:37,454 --> 01:40:38,956
Mason?

1201
01:40:39,122 --> 01:40:41,416
Yes, I'm here.

1202
01:40:41,542 --> 01:40:44,169
I was just thinking
how wonderful it was...

1203
01:40:44,336 --> 01:40:46,755
when the inmates weren't allowed
to talk in here.

1204
01:40:46,922 --> 01:40:49,550
Not allowed to talk.

1205
01:40:49,716 --> 01:40:51,760
How did you do it?

1206
01:40:51,927 --> 01:40:56,598
Uh, nurtured the hope
that there was hope.

1207
01:40:56,765 --> 01:41:00,227
That one day I'd breathe free air.

1208
01:41:00,394 --> 01:41:03,647
Perhaps meet my daughter.

1209
01:41:03,814 --> 01:41:08,235
Modest hopes, but, uh,
they kept a man alive.

1210
01:41:08,402 --> 01:41:11,405
What'd they put you
away for, John?

1211
01:41:11,613 --> 01:41:14,199
Oh, that's a long story.

1212
01:41:14,408 --> 01:41:16,869
Well, I'm not goin' anywhere.

1213
01:41:17,035 --> 01:41:20,581
When was the last communication
from our men on Alcatraz?

1214
01:41:20,789 --> 01:41:22,916
Seven hours.

1215
01:41:25,461 --> 01:41:28,714
- Thermite plasma is operational.
- Get me the president.

1216
01:41:28,881 --> 01:41:33,427
Be seated. Gentlemen,
consider yourselveson ground alert.

1217
01:41:33,594 --> 01:41:35,971
If we receive launch authority.
your mission is...

1218
01:41:36,138 --> 01:41:38,390
the complete thermal
destruction of Alcatraz Island.

1219
01:41:38,599 --> 01:41:42,644
The entire island is to be blanketed,
not one square inch missed.

1220
01:41:42,853 --> 01:41:48,025
Eighty-one American civilians and a number of U. S.
Marines will lose their lives in this air strike.

1221
01:41:49,818 --> 01:41:55,073
Why didn't you just tell them where the
microfilm was and create a solution?

1222
01:41:55,240 --> 01:42:00,162
Hmph. The moment they had
the microfilm, they'd suicide me.

1223
01:42:00,329 --> 01:42:03,373
- Some solution.
- And you ended up here.

1224
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:06,960
Which brings me to another question.

1225
01:42:07,127 --> 01:42:10,506
When you broke out... Let me see
if I can get this straight.

1226
01:42:10,672 --> 01:42:14,593
You went down the incinerator
chute. on the mine cars,

1227
01:42:14,802 --> 01:42:17,721
through the tunnels to the power plant.

1228
01:42:17,888 --> 01:42:21,266
under the steam engine...
That was really cool, by the way...

1229
01:42:21,391 --> 01:42:24,520
and into the cistern
through the intake pipe.

1230
01:42:24,728 --> 01:42:29,358
But how, in the name
of Zeus's butthole...

1231
01:42:29,525 --> 01:42:31,443
did you get out of your cell?

1232
01:42:31,610 --> 01:42:35,072
I only ask because
in our current situation...

1233
01:42:35,239 --> 01:42:41,036
well, it could prove
to be useful information, maybe!

1234
01:42:58,804 --> 01:43:01,598
Trade secrets, my son.

1235
01:43:03,475 --> 01:43:04,768
Wow.

1236
01:43:05,018 --> 01:43:07,396
General,
two operational rockets left.

1237
01:43:07,563 --> 01:43:09,857
One's at the lower lighthouse
and there is one on the roof.

1238
01:43:10,023 --> 01:43:14,027
And both of the birds are ready
to fly, sir. General, can you hear me?

1239
01:43:14,194 --> 01:43:17,197
- I heard you, Captain.
- Oh, just makin' sure.

1240
01:43:18,949 --> 01:43:21,827
Should we prepare
for launch, General?

1241
01:43:23,203 --> 01:43:27,166
- I'll handle the strategy, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

1242
01:43:27,374 --> 01:43:32,421
The hour is approaching, sir. Just
letting the General know of the time, sir.

1243
01:43:32,546 --> 01:43:34,423
I'm very aware of the time, Captain.

1244
01:43:34,590 --> 01:43:36,800
Aye, aye, sir. Lettin' you know.

1245
01:43:37,009 --> 01:43:39,595
Me and my boys are ready to
cock, lock, and ready to rock.

1246
01:43:41,972 --> 01:43:44,016
Mason, where're you going?

1247
01:43:44,183 --> 01:43:47,019
Thirty years ago I vowed
I wouldn't die in this toilet.

1248
01:43:47,186 --> 01:43:51,482
You're not leaving! There's a madman in
there with his hand on a, on a button!

1249
01:43:51,690 --> 01:43:55,319
Shh. Some sniper's
gonna get his ass.

1250
01:43:55,527 --> 01:43:58,155
Stop moving, Mason.

1251
01:43:59,698 --> 01:44:02,159
Mason, stop moving.

1252
01:44:02,326 --> 01:44:05,496
Hummel won't do it.
He's a soldier, not a murderer.

1253
01:44:05,662 --> 01:44:07,831
I read it in his eyes.

1254
01:44:07,998 --> 01:44:11,585
You read his eyes? Oh, well,
then everything's just fine!

1255
01:44:11,752 --> 01:44:14,880
- I can't afford to take that chance.
- Why don't you talk louder?

1256
01:44:15,005 --> 01:44:17,466
Three minutes to go, sir.

1257
01:44:19,343 --> 01:44:22,137
- They're not gonna call, Frank.
- Oh, they'll call.

1258
01:44:22,346 --> 01:44:25,599
They'll call if we fire
one of our rockets up their ass.

1259
01:44:25,808 --> 01:44:28,685
Sir.

1260
01:44:33,482 --> 01:44:36,193
- Hummel.
- Hi, Frank. It's Al Kramer here.

1261
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:39,112
- How's it going out there?
- How do you think it's going?

1262
01:44:39,279 --> 01:44:42,866
- Listen, on this end we're gonna need another
hour, Frank. - You've got three minutes.

1263
01:44:43,033 --> 01:44:47,120
- Listen, uh, Frank, we have to get final authorization
from the president. - You've got three minutes.

1264
01:44:47,287 --> 01:44:50,707
Frank, please don't do
anything stupid.

1265
01:44:50,874 --> 01:44:54,503
They want another hour.

1266
01:44:54,711 --> 01:44:57,965
Well, that's bullshit.
That's bullshit, General. They're lyin'!

1267
01:44:58,173 --> 01:45:02,177
They're calling our bluff, sir.
They're playing you for a fool, sir.

1268
01:45:02,386 --> 01:45:07,391
Order the launch, General.

1269
01:45:07,558 --> 01:45:11,061
Come on, General.
Let's be all we can be.

1270
01:45:25,534 --> 01:45:27,578
The mission's not complete!

1271
01:45:27,786 --> 01:45:29,621
Well, mine is.

1272
01:45:29,788 --> 01:45:32,416
When this is over,
you'll go back home...

1273
01:45:32,624 --> 01:45:37,296
driving Carla and your baby insane
in your beige Volvo.

1274
01:45:37,463 --> 01:45:40,966
And I'll be dead or back in prison,
which is the same thing.

1275
01:45:41,133 --> 01:45:45,471
You're not leaving.

1276
01:45:47,931 --> 01:45:51,852
All right, I'll do it myself.

1277
01:45:53,103 --> 01:45:55,189
I got three weeks'
weapons training.

1278
01:45:55,355 --> 01:45:59,651
I'll kick the... Out of
a platoon full of marines.

1279
01:45:59,818 --> 01:46:02,488
No problem.

1280
01:46:13,582 --> 01:46:16,835
- Major, patch me into Roof Battery.
- Aye, sir.

1281
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:20,798
Fire open control circuit
coordinates to the roof, sir.

1282
01:46:20,964 --> 01:46:23,300
Let's go!

1283
01:46:28,722 --> 01:46:29,681
- Laser powered up!
- Oh, no.

1284
01:46:29,932 --> 01:46:32,434
- Laser powered up!
- Oh, no.

1285
01:46:32,601 --> 01:46:35,354
I said, on your knees!

1286
01:46:35,562 --> 01:46:37,981
My name's Stanley Goodspeed.

1287
01:46:38,190 --> 01:46:41,068
I'm a chemical weapons
specialist for the FBI.

1288
01:46:41,235 --> 01:46:43,070
- Uh, glass or plastic?
- What?

1289
01:46:43,237 --> 01:46:45,697
- Glass or plastic? Glass or plastic?
- Shut the fuck up!

1290
01:46:45,906 --> 01:46:49,284
Because if the winds change after you
launch those rockets... we're all gonna die.

1291
01:46:49,451 --> 01:46:50,619
Shut up!

1292
01:46:50,786 --> 01:46:54,581
And you're gonna end up in either
a glass jar or a plastic bag.

1293
01:46:54,748 --> 01:46:59,753
So, what do you say you do the math, hand
over the gun and let's go find some rockets?

1294
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:03,173
I said shut the fuck...

1295
01:47:07,970 --> 01:47:11,473
You made the right choice.

1296
01:47:11,682 --> 01:47:15,769
I decided I didn't want your child
growing up without a father.

1297
01:47:15,978 --> 01:47:19,189
Hey, the last time I swam
this channel I was your age.

1298
01:47:19,356 --> 01:47:22,317
So, I'm fucked either way.
So, come on.

1299
01:47:22,442 --> 01:47:25,195
Weapon is hot. I am standing by
for the launch command.

1300
01:47:25,362 --> 01:47:28,824
Man, killing Navy SEALs
is one thing is this for real?

1301
01:47:28,991 --> 01:47:31,577
Hey, it's business.

1302
01:47:34,288 --> 01:47:36,790
Access code entered.
Weapon available for release.

1303
01:47:36,999 --> 01:47:38,834
Launch coordinates:

1304
01:47:39,001 --> 01:47:43,130
six, seven five, four, five, niner.

1305
01:47:44,923 --> 01:47:46,967
The weapon is hot.

1306
01:47:47,176 --> 01:47:50,012
I'm standing by for launch command.

1307
01:47:50,179 --> 01:47:52,014
That's affirmative.

1308
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:00,981
Standing by for command.

1309
01:48:09,031 --> 01:48:11,492
I'm waiting for
launch command, General.

1310
01:48:19,708 --> 01:48:21,627
- Fire.
- Fire!

1311
01:48:27,591 --> 01:48:29,802
Missile loose!
Missile loose!

1312
01:48:35,432 --> 01:48:39,895
Origin:
Alcatraz, 67253725.

1313
01:48:40,103 --> 01:48:44,066
- What's the goddamn heading?
- Heading 185 degrees south southeast.

1314
01:48:44,233 --> 01:48:47,694
- Speed?
- 300 knots. It's headed right at Oakland.

1315
01:48:47,861 --> 01:48:49,404
Football game.

1316
01:48:53,450 --> 01:48:55,118
Oh, my God.

1317
01:49:18,142 --> 01:49:19,935
Missile radically
changing direction.

1318
01:49:26,358 --> 01:49:30,696
New direction: 275 degrees west.
It's headed out to sea, sir.

1319
01:49:30,863 --> 01:49:33,031
Oh, Christ!

1320
01:49:34,616 --> 01:49:38,453
Missile losing altitude. Falling.

1321
01:49:38,579 --> 01:49:41,874
Falling, 300 feet, 200, 100.

1322
01:49:45,210 --> 01:49:48,046
Bogey detonated
under water.

1323
01:49:50,466 --> 01:49:52,468
What the fuck?

1324
01:49:52,634 --> 01:49:55,888
- It missed.
- Well, that's great.

1325
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:59,516
Extremely great.
But there's still one left.

1326
01:49:59,725 --> 01:50:03,353
What happened to the rocket? What
the fuck happened?

1327
01:50:03,562 --> 01:50:06,857
What the fuck is going on
to the coordinates? Sir! Major!

1328
01:50:07,024 --> 01:50:09,359
Captain, step outside.

1329
01:50:09,485 --> 01:50:12,112
- Talk to me, sir.
- Captain, step outside!

1330
01:50:25,667 --> 01:50:27,795
Get me the Pentagon.

1331
01:50:40,766 --> 01:50:43,060
What the hell was that, Frank?

1332
01:50:44,978 --> 01:50:48,273
- I said, what the hell... - I heard what you
said! If you're gonna be insubordinate...

1333
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:51,318
- I'd appreciate it if you'd do it with a little more respect.
- Cut the crap, General.

1334
01:50:51,485 --> 01:50:53,695
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not ready to kill these people.

1335
01:50:53,862 --> 01:50:55,864
- Call the Pentagon. Ask for more time.
- No!

1336
01:50:56,031 --> 01:50:58,992
Do it, Frank!
We're coming loose.

1337
01:50:59,201 --> 01:51:02,204
You're coming loose.
The rest of us are in complete control.

1338
01:51:02,371 --> 01:51:05,249
- We're askin' 'em. We're askin' 'em for a new deadline.
- Put the phone down.

1339
01:51:05,457 --> 01:51:07,876
- The men are falling apart.
- The men are marines!

1340
01:51:08,085 --> 01:51:12,005
Are they?
I wanna talk to General Kramer.

1341
01:51:12,172 --> 01:51:14,842
- You've been asked by an old friend.
- Put him on the phone right now.

1342
01:51:14,967 --> 01:51:17,010
- You've been ordered by a superior officer.
- This is Major Baxter.

1343
01:51:17,219 --> 01:51:20,430
Now you're being given your
last chance by a man with a gun.

1344
01:51:20,597 --> 01:51:22,683
Put the phone down.

1345
01:51:25,352 --> 01:51:29,606
- I thought you weren't ready to kill.
- I'm warmin' up.

1346
01:51:29,773 --> 01:51:31,859
At ease.

1347
01:51:40,576 --> 01:51:43,579
They need a decision,
Mr. President.

1348
01:51:49,626 --> 01:51:53,464
These past few hours...

1349
01:51:53,630 --> 01:51:57,843
have been the longest,
darkest of my life.

1350
01:51:58,010 --> 01:52:01,555
How does one weigh human life?

1351
01:52:02,973 --> 01:52:06,351
One million civilians
against 81 hostages.

1352
01:52:06,518 --> 01:52:09,771
And in the middle, Frank Hummel.

1353
01:52:09,980 --> 01:52:14,109
That we have ignored, abandoned...

1354
01:52:14,318 --> 01:52:18,614
or marginalized a great
soldier like Frank Hummel...

1355
01:52:18,822 --> 01:52:21,909
and that American boys have paid
for that neglect...

1356
01:52:22,034 --> 01:52:25,370
in blood is equally real...

1357
01:52:25,537 --> 01:52:27,873
and equally tragic.

1358
01:52:30,459 --> 01:52:32,544
We are at war with terror.

1359
01:52:32,711 --> 01:52:36,215
Fighting a war means casualties.

1360
01:52:36,381 --> 01:52:39,802
This is the worst call
I've ever had to make.

1361
01:52:44,014 --> 01:52:47,351
Air strike approved.

1362
01:52:49,770 --> 01:52:51,730
Red Thunder to tower.
Request clearance.

1363
01:52:51,897 --> 01:52:55,150
With the amount of firepower
they're gonna drop in there...

1364
01:52:55,275 --> 01:52:58,362
- Tower this is Strike Leader. Prepared to go.
- it'll be over in a few seconds.

1365
01:52:58,529 --> 01:53:01,198
Flight time to drop point: 17 minutes.

1366
01:53:07,913 --> 01:53:11,166
Excuse me, General, sir,
with all due respect to you,

1367
01:53:11,333 --> 01:53:14,044
- what the fuck is going on?
- You changed the coordinates, didn't you, General?

1368
01:53:14,253 --> 01:53:17,381
- That's affirmative, Captain.
- So, now they think we're gutless?

1369
01:53:17,589 --> 01:53:20,175
The Feds?
They think we won't actually do it.

1370
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:23,053
They're gonna come at us with everything
they've got. Air and sea.

1371
01:53:23,262 --> 01:53:25,556
They're gonna bomb our ass
back to the Stone Age.

1372
01:53:25,722 --> 01:53:27,641
They don't know we missed on purpose.

1373
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:33,063
Great. We're not gutless,
we're incompetent. That right?

1374
01:53:33,188 --> 01:53:36,525
I don't think I like your tone, Captain.
We planned for this contingency.

1375
01:53:36,692 --> 01:53:39,611
Load the V. X. into the choppers,
take four hostages and evacuate.

1376
01:53:39,778 --> 01:53:41,947
The consequences of our actions
I'll face alone.

1377
01:53:42,114 --> 01:53:45,242
Excuse me, General,
but what about the fucking money?

1378
01:53:45,450 --> 01:53:47,828
There is no fucking money.
Mission's over.

1379
01:53:47,995 --> 01:53:49,705
Bullshit it's over.

1380
01:53:49,872 --> 01:53:53,333
You're talking to a General, soldier.
Maintain discipline.

1381
01:53:53,542 --> 01:53:58,130
I'm not a soldier, Major. The day
we took hostages we became mercenaries.

1382
01:53:58,338 --> 01:54:03,051
And mercenaries get paid
I want my fucking money!

1383
01:54:03,177 --> 01:54:05,679
This mission was based
on the threat of force.

1384
01:54:05,846 --> 01:54:09,475
I'm not about to kill 80, 000
innocent people.

1385
01:54:09,641 --> 01:54:12,895
Do you think
I'm out of my fucking mind?

1386
01:54:13,061 --> 01:54:16,023
We bluffed. They called it.
The mission's over.

1387
01:54:19,568 --> 01:54:22,154
Whoever said anything
about bluffing, General?

1388
01:54:22,362 --> 01:54:25,073
Stand down, Captain.

1389
01:54:29,828 --> 01:54:32,831
Stand down, Captain!

1390
01:54:37,544 --> 01:54:42,257
Major, I'm ordering you to take
these men to the choppers and evacuate.

1391
01:54:42,424 --> 01:54:45,761
That's a simple order, Major!

1392
01:54:45,928 --> 01:54:48,013
It's not so simple, Frank.

1393
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:52,810
Sergeant Crisp secure the General.

1394
01:54:52,976 --> 01:54:55,896
I'm relieving you
of your command, sir.

1395
01:54:59,775 --> 01:55:02,402
Sergeant!

1396
01:55:09,034 --> 01:55:12,079
- I'll have that sidearm, sir.
- You mean this sidearm?

1397
01:55:21,088 --> 01:55:24,466
Major Baxter, you're either
with us or against us.

1398
01:55:30,097 --> 01:55:34,059
It has been the greatest honor
of my life to serve with you, General.

1399
01:55:38,355 --> 01:55:43,485
But like he said... it's over.

1400
01:56:01,044 --> 01:56:03,130
Let's get him.

1401
01:56:08,302 --> 01:56:10,846
Mason!

1402
01:56:12,055 --> 01:56:14,808
My God, what have I done?

1403
01:56:14,975 --> 01:56:18,729
Where's the last rocket?
Where's the last rocket?

1404
01:56:20,564 --> 01:56:23,442
- Where's the last rocket?
- Lower lighthouse.

1405
01:56:23,609 --> 01:56:26,195
- Lower lighthouse.
- Go!

1406
01:56:38,749 --> 01:56:42,377
Darrow, go to the lighthouse.
I'll take care of this fucker!

1407
01:56:48,759 --> 01:56:51,303
One, two, three!

1408
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:52,888
Eat that!

1409
01:57:07,361 --> 01:57:08,737
Did it.

1410
01:57:39,893 --> 01:57:43,564
Come here. Come here,
you little chicken shit!

1411
01:57:43,730 --> 01:57:47,192
You shoot me, I drop this.
We're both dead.

1412
01:57:47,359 --> 01:57:49,987
Well, come on. Come on.
Don't be scared. I won't hurt you!

1413
01:57:50,195 --> 01:57:52,281
- Come on.
- Do you know how this shit works?

1414
01:57:52,489 --> 01:57:54,533
You know how this shit works?

1415
01:57:57,077 --> 01:58:00,622
Come on. Come on.

1416
01:58:00,789 --> 01:58:02,833
I don't need the gun.
I'll put it down.

1417
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:07,254
Come on. Let's play.
Come on. Come on.

1418
01:58:07,421 --> 01:58:12,009
Listen, I think we got started off
on the wrong foot. Stan Goodspeed, FBI.

1419
01:58:12,176 --> 01:58:15,304
Uh, Let's talk music. Do you like
the Elton John song, "Rocket Man"?

1420
01:58:15,471 --> 01:58:19,766
I don't like soft-ass shit.
Oh, you... Oh, oh. Oh.

1421
01:58:19,933 --> 01:58:24,980
Well, I only bring it up because,
uh, it's you. You're the Rocket Man.

1422
01:58:26,607 --> 01:58:29,985
No!

1423
01:58:32,029 --> 01:58:34,031
How do you like how that shit works?

1424
01:58:34,198 --> 01:58:36,158
Second rocket's away!

1425
01:58:44,041 --> 01:58:46,043
It splashed into the bay, sir.
No detonation.

1426
01:58:46,210 --> 01:58:47,961
Shit!

1427
01:59:09,066 --> 01:59:10,651
Darrow!

1428
01:59:12,152 --> 01:59:13,987
Open up!

1429
01:59:16,990 --> 01:59:18,534
Come on.

1430
01:59:18,700 --> 01:59:20,369
Open up!

1431
01:59:49,231 --> 01:59:51,942
Hey, you mother!

1432
02:00:25,517 --> 02:00:28,812
Oh, I'm gonna get you now, baby.

1433
02:00:31,690 --> 02:00:34,193
Okay.

1434
02:00:35,694 --> 02:00:37,988
I got ya. I got you, baby.

1435
02:00:38,197 --> 02:00:40,365
Come on.

1436
02:00:57,800 --> 02:00:59,802
Fucker!

1437
02:01:25,786 --> 02:01:30,249
Red Thunder Strike Leader.
Time on target: seven minutes.

1438
02:01:46,723 --> 02:01:50,519
English prick.
I tell you my old man was Irish?

1439
02:01:53,397 --> 02:01:56,108
Maintain air speed 450 knots.

1440
02:02:00,779 --> 02:02:02,906
Fuck!

1441
02:02:22,134 --> 02:02:24,636
It's me and you, pal.

1442
02:02:24,803 --> 02:02:27,389
I want that fucking chip!

1443
02:02:36,815 --> 02:02:38,734
I love pressure.

1444
02:02:46,158 --> 02:02:49,453
I know you're in here,
and I know you can hear me.

1445
02:02:49,620 --> 02:02:52,498
Now, pay the piper
and come out like a man.

1446
02:03:22,528 --> 02:03:24,446
Increase speed
to 500 knots.

1447
02:03:24,655 --> 02:03:27,991
You motherfucker! Die!

1448
02:03:32,037 --> 02:03:35,999
I'm gonna choke my million bucks
out of you. You're gonna die.

1449
02:03:36,166 --> 02:03:38,961
Eat that, you fuck!

1450
02:04:07,364 --> 02:04:10,826
All right, team, inbound.
Time on target: 60 seconds.

1451
02:04:14,872 --> 02:04:18,792
Come to course heading
142 degrees.

1452
02:04:26,633 --> 02:04:28,719
When he neutralizes the threat...

1453
02:04:28,927 --> 02:04:31,889
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

1454
02:04:36,727 --> 02:04:40,355
- Let's tighten up that formation.
- May God have mercy on your souls.

1455
02:04:40,522 --> 02:04:43,609
Please don't let this happen. There has
to be something you can do. Please.

1456
02:04:54,369 --> 02:04:57,289
Let's drop to the deck.
100 feet below radar.

1457
02:05:07,508 --> 02:05:09,843
Target acquired.
Rolling in.

1458
02:05:13,305 --> 02:05:15,974
This is Red Thunder.
Master armed. Master armed.

1459
02:05:16,183 --> 02:05:18,393
Master armed.

1460
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:21,021
Time on target: 12 seconds.

1461
02:05:23,607 --> 02:05:26,610
Time on target: 10 seconds.

1462
02:05:30,823 --> 02:05:32,658
Stay tight, gentlemen.

1463
02:05:35,077 --> 02:05:37,454
I got green smoke.
I got green smoke!

1464
02:05:37,621 --> 02:05:40,874
This is C. Q. One, C. Q. One!
Green smoke! We have green smoke! Over.

1465
02:05:41,041 --> 02:05:43,127
- Eh, gimme that! Gimme that! Abort!
- Abort!

1466
02:05:43,252 --> 02:05:45,963
- Flight leader, abort, abort, abort!
- Jesus Chri...

1467
02:05:48,257 --> 02:05:50,843
I already dropped them!

1468
02:05:59,935 --> 02:06:01,687
Oh, goddamn it!

1469
02:06:02,896 --> 02:06:05,816
Oh, my God!

1470
02:06:06,024 --> 02:06:09,528
Get out of my way. Let me through,
please. Let me through!

1471
02:06:12,739 --> 02:06:17,911
The cells did not get hit. The bombs
hit on the back of the island.

1472
02:06:39,808 --> 02:06:42,686
I'm fed up saving your ass.

1473
02:06:42,853 --> 02:06:44,897
I'm amazed you ever got past puberty.

1474
02:06:45,105 --> 02:06:49,985
I suppose all this will make
a great bedtime story to tell your kid.

1475
02:06:50,152 --> 02:06:52,946
You're insane, Mason.
The kid'll have nightmares.

1476
02:06:53,113 --> 02:06:55,449
Spend all my money on shrinks.

1477
02:06:55,616 --> 02:07:01,121
Goodspeed, come in. Goodspeed,
Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

1478
02:07:01,288 --> 02:07:03,165
Scanning all radio frequencies.

1479
02:07:03,332 --> 02:07:05,501
Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

1480
02:07:05,667 --> 02:07:09,755
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in!

1481
02:07:14,927 --> 02:07:18,847
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in!

1482
02:07:19,056 --> 02:07:20,557
This is Goodspeed.

1483
02:07:22,893 --> 02:07:26,146
Are the hostages alive?

1484
02:07:26,313 --> 02:07:28,232
Every one of 'em.

1485
02:07:31,151 --> 02:07:35,572
Goodspeed, it's Womack.
What about Mason?

1486
02:07:43,122 --> 02:07:44,957
He's dead, sir.

1487
02:07:45,124 --> 02:07:48,919
- How? When?
- Just come and get me.

1488
02:07:51,505 --> 02:07:53,423
Womack tore up your pardon, John.

1489
02:07:53,632 --> 02:07:57,261
But, of course.
I knew he would.

1490
02:07:57,427 --> 02:08:00,639
The S. D. U. s and the scuba gear
should still be where we came ashore.

1491
02:08:00,806 --> 02:08:03,016
If you can get to the
Pan Pacific Hotel,

1492
02:08:03,183 --> 02:08:05,477
there's clothes
in my closet, $200 in the Bible.

1493
02:08:05,644 --> 02:08:07,479
Room 26.

1494
02:08:07,646 --> 02:08:12,442
Well, it's been a long time
since I've said thank you to anybody.

1495
02:08:12,651 --> 02:08:15,070
But thank you.

1496
02:08:17,322 --> 02:08:22,286
Well, Stanley, uh, this is when
we go our separate ways, huh?

1497
02:08:23,996 --> 02:08:28,417
But, uh, I'm sure you know
the etymology of your name "Goodspeed."

1498
02:08:28,584 --> 02:08:32,671
Yeah, Godspeed: to wish someone
a prosperous journey. Why?

1499
02:08:32,838 --> 02:08:35,799
Well, if you fancy a journey...

1500
02:08:35,966 --> 02:08:39,720
I recommend Fort Walton, Kansas.

1501
02:08:39,887 --> 02:08:41,889
I was thinking of Maui.

1502
02:08:42,055 --> 02:08:44,016
No.

1503
02:08:48,729 --> 02:08:51,648
Forget Maui.

1504
02:08:57,154 --> 02:09:00,532
"St. Michael's Church,
Fort Walton, Kansas.

1505
02:09:00,699 --> 02:09:03,619
Front pew, right leg.

1506
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:05,913
Hollow."

1507
02:09:06,079 --> 02:09:09,374
Is this what I think it is?

1508
02:09:10,959 --> 02:09:13,545
Mason?

1509
02:09:27,434 --> 02:09:30,562
- Congratulations, Dr. Goodspeed. You did it.
- Thank you, sir.

1510
02:09:30,771 --> 02:09:33,982
You know, for a while there,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

1511
02:09:34,149 --> 02:09:37,736
Well done, son.
So, where's Mason?

1512
02:09:37,903 --> 02:09:41,907
Vaporized. Blown out to sea.

1513
02:09:42,116 --> 02:09:44,368
Blown out to sea, huh?

1514
02:09:44,535 --> 02:09:45,869
Yeah.

1515
02:09:46,036 --> 02:09:48,789
Poor bastard.

1516
02:09:52,209 --> 02:09:54,545
Goodspeed, where's Mason?
Where's his body?

1517
02:09:54,711 --> 02:09:57,131
I wanna see that son of a bitch!

1518
02:09:57,297 --> 02:10:00,134
Vaporized, sir.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1519
02:10:00,342 --> 02:10:05,597
What? Vaporized?
A body can vaporize?

1520
02:10:05,764 --> 02:10:08,600
Oh, yeah!
Absolutely, sir.

1521
02:10:11,311 --> 02:10:14,273
St. Michael's Church,

1522
02:10:14,439 --> 02:10:17,276
front pew, right leg.
Front pew, right leg.

1523
02:10:17,442 --> 02:10:19,862
Vandals! Vandals!

1524
02:10:20,028 --> 02:10:22,156
Oh, yes, baby, come on!

1525
02:10:22,364 --> 02:10:26,118
- Stop! Vandals! Stop!
- I'm sorry!

1526
02:10:26,285 --> 02:10:28,996
- Come on, baby!
- I've got it! Okay, let's go!

1527
02:10:29,204 --> 02:10:32,374
- Stop! Stop!
- Sorry!

1528
02:10:32,541 --> 02:10:35,752
Stop! Hey, hey, you!

1529
02:10:37,880 --> 02:10:40,299
Vandals! Vandals!

1530
02:10:40,340 --> 02:10:45,846
Honey, uh, you wanna know
who really killed J. F. K.?

1531
02:11:00,340 --> 02:11:02,846
<u>"THE END"</u>
