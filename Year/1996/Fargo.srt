1
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:12,067
<i>And keep your retirement</i>

2
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:17,739
<i>And your so-called social security</i>

3
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:25,706
<i>Big city, turn me loose
and set me free...</i>

4
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:40,262
I'm Jerry Lundegaard.

5
00:03:41,264 --> 00:03:42,556
You're Jerry Lundegaard?

6
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,724
Yeah.

7
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,017
Shep Proudfoot said...

8
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:48,270
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30.
What gives, man?

9
00:03:48,438 --> 00:03:50,105
Shep said 8:30.

10
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:51,356
We've been sitting here an hour.

11
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:53,108
He's peed three times already.

12
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:56,194
I'm sure sorry. Shep told me 8:30.

13
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:58,447
It was a mix-up, I guess.

14
00:03:58,781 --> 00:03:59,781
You got the car?

15
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:01,116
Yeah. You bet.

16
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,827
It's out in the lot there,
brand-new, burnt umber Cierra.

17
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:06,371
Yeah, okay.
Well, sit down, then.

18
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:08,290
I'm Carl Showalter.

19
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:10,584
This is my associate, Gaear Grimsrud.

20
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,085
Yeah. How you doing?

21
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,630
So, we all set on this thing, then?

22
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:16,506
Sure, Jerry. We're all set.
Why wouldn't we be?

23
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:17,966
Yeah, no, I'm sure you are.

24
00:04:18,051 --> 00:04:19,384
Shep vouched for you and all.

25
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:22,304
I got every confidence here 
in you fellas.

26
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,269
I guess that's it, then.

27
00:04:29,354 --> 00:04:30,395
Here are the keys.

28
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,772
No, that's not it, Jerry.

29
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:32,898
Huh?

30
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:35,359
The new vehicle plus $40,000.

31
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:38,028
Yeah, but the deal was the car first,

32
00:04:38,112 --> 00:04:41,406
then the 40,000,
like as if it was the ransom.

33
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:42,574
I thought Shep told you.

34
00:04:42,659 --> 00:04:44,201
Shep didn't tell us much, Jerry.

35
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:45,327
Well, okay...

36
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,579
Except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.

37
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:49,247
Yeah, well, that was a mix-up, then.

38
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:50,832
Yeah, you already said that.

39
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:54,503
Yeah, but it's not
a whole pay-in-advance deal.

40
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:58,757
See, I give you a brand-new vehicle
in advance, and then...

41
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:00,342
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.

42
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:01,426
Okay.

43
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:03,595
I'm not gonna sit here and debate.

44
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,721
I will say this, though.

45
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:07,474
What Shep told us
didn't make a whole lot of sense.

46
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,602
Oh, no. It's real sound.
It's all worked out.

47
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,271
You want your own wife kidnapped.

48
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:14,398
Yeah.

49
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,442
You...

50
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:19,403
My point is,

51
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:22,322
you pay the ransom, what, 
80,000 bucks?

52
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:26,284
I mean, you give us half the ransom,
40,000, you keep half.

53
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:27,661
It's like robbing Peter to pay Paul.

54
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:28,954
It doesn't make any sense.

55
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,249
Okay, see, it's not me paying the ransom.

56
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:35,210
The thing is, my wife, she's wealthy.

57
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,004
Her dad, he's real well-off.

58
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:38,463
Now, I'm in a bit of trouble.

59
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:40,007
What kind of trouble you in, Jerry?

60
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:43,844
Well, that's...
I'm not gonna get into...

61
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:45,345
See, I just need the money.

62
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,556
Now, her dad, he's real well-off.

63
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,349
So, why don't you just ask him 
for the money?

64
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:50,809
Or your fucking wife, you know?

65
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,310
Or your fucking wife, Jerry?

66
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:53,603
Well...

67
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:56,440
It's all part of this...

68
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:00,110
They don't know I need it, see?

69
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:03,405
Okay, so there's that.
And even if they did, I wouldn't get it,

70
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:04,990
so there's that on top, then.

71
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,324
See, these are personal matters.

72
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:07,409
Personal matters?

73
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,412
Yeah, personal matters that needn't...

74
00:06:10,663 --> 00:06:12,414
Okay, Jerry.

75
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:16,501
You're tasking us to perform this mission,
but you won't...

76
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:18,086
You won't...

77
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:22,883
Fuck it.
Let's take a look at that Cierra.

78
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:32,100
Hon?

79
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:34,853
Hi, hon!
Welcome back!

80
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:36,772
How was Fargo?

81
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,523
Yeah, real good.

82
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:40,275
Dad's here.

83
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,822
<i>...leads the Badgers in goal production
with five this year.</i>

84
00:06:46,032 --> 00:06:47,032
How you doing, Wade?

85
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:48,200
Yeah, pretty good.

86
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:49,284
What you watching there?

87
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:50,410
Gophers.

88
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:51,870
Who they playing?

89
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:52,996
Ooh!

90
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,338
Is he staying for supper, then?

91
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,131
Yeah. I think so.

92
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:04,841
- Dad?
- What?

93
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:06,218
Are you staying for supper?

94
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:07,427
Yeah.

95
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,144
May I be excused?

96
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:17,229
You done there?

97
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:18,730
Uh-huh. I'm going out.

98
00:07:18,815 --> 00:07:20,565
- Where are you going?
- Just out.

99
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,817
Just McDonald's.

100
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:23,568
- Back at 9:30.
- Okay.

101
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,404
He just ate.
He didn't finish.

102
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:29,074
Going to McDonald's 
instead of finishing here.

103
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:30,659
He sees his friends there.
It's okay.

104
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:32,410
It's okay, McDonald's?

105
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:34,287
What do you think they do there?

106
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:36,414
They don't drink milk shakes,
I assure you.

107
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:37,999
It's okay, Dad.

108
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:47,425
Wade, have you had a chance 
to think about

109
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,010
that deal I was talking about,

110
00:07:49,095 --> 00:07:50,762
those 40 acres there, in Wayzata?

111
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:52,264
You told me about it.

112
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:54,266
Yeah, you said you'd have 
to think about it.

113
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,767
I understand.
It's a lot of money.

114
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:58,770
It's a heck of a lot.
What did you say you were gonna put there?

115
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:00,147
A lot. It's a...

116
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:01,690
I know it's a lot.

117
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:02,941
I mean a parking lot.

118
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:06,027
Well, 750,000 is a lot.

119
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:07,946
Yeah, well, it's a chunk, but...

120
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,074
I had a couple lots, late 50s.
Lost a lot of money.

121
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:12,784
- A lot of money.
- Yeah, but the difference...

122
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:15,036
I thought you were gonna show it 
to Stan Grossman.

123
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:17,372
He passes on this stuff
before it gets kicked up to me.

124
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,000
Well, Stan'll say, "No dice."
That's why you pay him.

125
00:08:20,084 --> 00:08:22,085
I'm asking you here, Wade.

126
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:26,381
This could work out real good
for me and Jean and Scotty.

127
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:29,259
Jean and Scotty never have to worry.

128
00:08:44,108 --> 00:08:46,067
Where is Pancakes House?

129
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,320
What?

130
00:08:48,404 --> 00:08:50,530
We stop at Pancakes House.

131
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,326
What are you, nuts?
We had pancakes for breakfast.

132
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,994
Gotta go to a place
where I can get a shot

133
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,662
and a beer and a steak, maybe.

134
00:08:57,747 --> 00:09:00,165
Not more fucking pancakes.
Come on.

135
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:07,172
Oh, come on, man.

136
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:10,508
Okay. Here's an idea.

137
00:09:11,052 --> 00:09:12,260
We can stop outside of Brainerd.

138
00:09:12,345 --> 00:09:14,679
I know a place there where we can get laid.
What do you think?

139
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:16,681
I'm fucking hungry now, you know.

140
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:20,435
Yeah, yeah, Jesus.
I'm saying we can stop, get pancakes,

141
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,938
and then we'll get laid, all right?

142
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,198
<i>Lou Diamond, line one.</i>

143
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,285
We sat right here in this room

144
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,828
and went over this and over this.

145
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:39,955
Yeah, but that TruCoat...

146
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:42,958
I sat right here and said 
I didn't want any TruCoat.

147
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:45,043
Yeah, but I'm saying that TruCoat.

148
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,128
You don't get it,
you get oxidation problems.

149
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:48,713
It'll cost you a heck 
of a lot more than $500.

150
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:49,881
You're sitting there.

151
00:09:49,966 --> 00:09:51,007
You're talking in circles.

152
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,926
You're talking like
we didn't go over this already.

153
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,094
Yeah, but this TruCoat...

154
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:56,304
We had a deal here for 19,500.

155
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:58,098
You sat there and darned
if you didn't tell me

156
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,891
you'd get me this car,
these options,

157
00:09:59,976 --> 00:10:01,893
without the sealant, for 19,500.

158
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:03,436
All right, I'm not saying I didn't.

159
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:05,063
You called me 20 minutes ago and said

160
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,856
you had it ready to make delivery.

161
00:10:06,941 --> 00:10:08,566
You says,
"Come on down and get it."

162
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:12,779
And here you are, and you're wasting 
my time and my wife's time,

163
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,782
and I'm paying 19,500
for this vehicle here.

164
00:10:16,492 --> 00:10:17,867
All right.

165
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,495
I'll talk to my boss.

166
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,959
See, they install that TruCoat
at the factory.

167
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:29,462
There's nothing we can do,
but I'll talk to my boss.

168
00:10:30,673 --> 00:10:32,799
These guys here.
These guys.

169
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:36,678
It's always the same.
It's always more.

170
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,642
You going to the Gophers on Sunday?

171
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:44,227
Oh, you betcha.

172
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:46,688
You wouldn't have an extra ticket?

173
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,149
You kidding?

174
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:52,068
Well...

175
00:10:54,947 --> 00:10:56,614
he never done this before,

176
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:59,451
but seeing as
it's special circumstances and all,

177
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:02,454
he says I can knock $100 off that TruCoat.

178
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,582
100?

179
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:08,626
You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard.

180
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:10,462
You're a bald-faced liar.

181
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,172
Bucky, please.

182
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,841
A fucking liar.

183
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,426
Bucky, please.

184
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:19,054
Where's my goddamn checkbook?

185
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:20,764
Let's get this over with.

186
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,391
Where is it?

187
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:02,597
<i>From Hollywood,
The Tonight Show, starring...</i>  

188
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,018
I am talking about your potential.

189
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:08,103
Mmm-hmm.

190
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,814
You're not a C student.

191
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:12,232
Yeah.

192
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:14,651
Yet you're getting C grades.

193
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:18,029
It's that disparity there
that concerns your dad and me.

194
00:12:18,114 --> 00:12:19,114
Uh-huh.

195
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:21,533
You know what a disparity is?

196
00:12:21,617 --> 00:12:22,659
Yeah!

197
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,869
Okay! Well, that's why we...

198
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:27,247
We don't want you going out for hockey.

199
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,665
Oh, man!

200
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:30,667
Come on. What's the big deal?
It's just an hour...

201
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:32,544
Hold on.

202
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:33,878
What's the big deal?

203
00:12:33,963 --> 00:12:35,046
Hello?

204
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:36,923
<i>- Yeah, hiya, hon.</i>
- Oh, hi, Dad.

205
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,091
<i>Is Jerry around?</i>

206
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:40,051
Yeah. Hon!
Yeah, he's here.

207
00:12:40,136 --> 00:12:41,386
Yeah, I'll catch him for you.

208
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,595
- Hon!
- Yeah?

209
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,264
- It's Dad.
- Okay.

210
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,307
Look, Dad, there's no fucking way...

211
00:12:46,392 --> 00:12:47,392
Scotty!

212
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,811
Hey, let's watch that language there.

213
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:51,062
How you doing there, Wade?

214
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:52,230
<i>What's going on there?</i>

215
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:54,691
Nothing, Wade.
How you doing there?

216
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:56,818
<i>Stan Grossman looked at your proposal.</i>

217
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,194
<i>He says it's pretty sweet.</i>

218
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,279
No kidding?

219
00:12:59,363 --> 00:13:00,572
<i>Might be interested.</i>

220
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:04,993
No kidding?
I'd need the cash pretty quick there,

221
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:06,578
in order to close the deal.

222
00:13:06,662 --> 00:13:08,288
<i>Come by at 2:30.
We'll talk about it.</i>

223
00:13:08,372 --> 00:13:11,416
<i>If your numbers are right, 
Stan says it's pretty sweet.</i>

224
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,334
<i>- Stan, you know, Grossman.</i>
- Yeah.

225
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:14,419
<i>2:30.</i>

226
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:15,628
Yeah. Okay.

227
00:13:30,311 --> 00:13:32,270
Say, Shep, how you doing there?

228
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:34,272
Say, you know those two fellas

229
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,024
you put me in touch with up there in Fargo?

230
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:37,775
I put you in touch with Grimsrud.

231
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,569
Yeah, well, he had a buddy there.

232
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:40,820
He...
Then I don't vouch for him.

233
00:13:40,905 --> 00:13:41,988
Well, that's okay.

234
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:44,282
I vouch for Grimsrud.
Who's his buddy?

235
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,950
Carl something.

236
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:47,452
Never heard of him.
Don't vouch for him.

237
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:50,497
Well, that's okay.
He's a buddy of the guy you vouched for,

238
00:13:50,581 --> 00:13:51,998
so I'm not worried. I just...

239
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,501
I was wondering, see, 
I got to get in touch with him.

240
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:58,505
See, this deal I needed him for, 
I may not need it anymore.

241
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,548
- Something's happening, see.
- Call him up.

242
00:14:00,633 --> 00:14:04,052
Yeah, well, see, I did that,
and I haven't been able to get him,

243
00:14:04,136 --> 00:14:07,305
so I thought maybe you'd know 
an alternate number, or what have you.

244
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:08,389
Nope.

245
00:14:08,474 --> 00:14:10,308
Okay. Well...

246
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:11,893
Real good, then.

247
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,582
Can you crack a fucking window open, man?

248
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:40,421
You know, it's proven
that secondhand smoke is...

249
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:42,507
You know, a cancer agent.

250
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,427
Hey, look at that.
Twin Cities.

251
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:48,096
That's the IDS Building,
the big glass one.

252
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:53,226
Tallest skyscraper in the Midwest 
after the Sears in Chicago,

253
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:55,937
or John Hancock building, whatever.

254
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:58,565
You ever been to Minneapolis?

255
00:14:58,649 --> 00:14:59,774
No.

256
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:04,862
Would it kill you to say something?

257
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:06,698
I did.

258
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:11,119
"No." That's the first thing you've said 
in the last four hours.

259
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,954
That's a...

260
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:15,623
That's a fountain of conversation, man.

261
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,375
That's a geyser.

262
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,253
I mean, whoa, daddy.
Stand back, man.

263
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:23,214
Shit.

264
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:25,049
I'm sitting here driving.

265
00:15:25,134 --> 00:15:26,509
I'm doing all the driving, man,

266
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,303
whole fucking way from Brainerd, driving.

267
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:31,097
Just trying to chat.

268
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,766
You know, keep our spirits up,

269
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:34,934
fight the boredom of the road,

270
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:39,188
and you can't say one fucking thing 
just in the way of conversation?

271
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:43,318
Oh, fuck it. 
I don't have to talk either, man.

272
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,194
See how you like it.

273
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:50,992
Just total fucking silence.

274
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,453
Two could play at that game, smart guy.

275
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,830
We'll just see how you like it.

276
00:15:58,334 --> 00:15:59,876
Total silence.

277
00:16:02,296 --> 00:16:05,548
<i>Mr. Lundegaard,
this is Reilly Diefenbach from GMAC.</i>

278
00:16:05,633 --> 00:16:06,758
<i>How are you this morning?</i>

279
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:08,134
Real good. How you doing?

280
00:16:08,218 --> 00:16:09,636
<i>Pretty good, Mr. Lundegaard.</i>

281
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,763
<i>You're damn hard to get 
on the phone.</i>

282
00:16:11,847 --> 00:16:14,265
It's pretty darn busy here,
but that's the way we like it.

283
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:15,391
<i>Well, that's for sure.</i>

284
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:17,393
<i>Now, I just need on these last,</i>

285
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,520
<i>these financing documents
that you sent us,</i>

286
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:21,773
<i>I can't read the serial numbers
of the vehicles.</i>

287
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,149
Yeah, but I already got the...

288
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,651
It's okay.
The loans are in place.

289
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,486
I already got the...
What? The... 

290
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,820
<i>Yeah, the 320,000.</i>

291
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:29,364
<i>You got the money last month.</i>

292
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:30,823
Yeah, so we're all set, then.

293
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:33,117
<i>Yeah, but the vehicles
that you're borrowing on,</i>

294
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:36,120
<i>I just can't read the serial numbers
on your application.</i>

295
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:37,372
<i>Maybe if you could just read...</i>

296
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:38,498
Yeah, but the deal's already done.

297
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:39,707
I already got the money.

298
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,250
<i>Yes, but if we have an audit here,</i>

299
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,710
<i>I just have to know that these vehicles</i>

300
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:44,128
<i>you're financing with this money,</i>

301
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:45,505
<i>that they really exist.</i>

302
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:47,799
Yeah, well, they exist, all right.

303
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:49,550
<i>I'm sure they do,</i>

304
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:53,012
<i>but I can't read the serial numbers here,
so if you could read me...</i>

305
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:56,057
Yeah, but... See...

306
00:16:56,642 --> 00:16:57,934
I don't have them in front of me.

307
00:16:58,018 --> 00:16:59,477
Why don't I just fax you over a copy?

308
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,145
<i>No, well, no, fax is no good.</i>

309
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:03,231
<i>That's what I have,
and I can't read the darn thing.</i>

310
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:06,067
Yeah, okay. I'll have my girl
send you a copy, then.

311
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:09,487
<i>Okay, because if I can't correlate this note
with the specific vehicles,</i>

312
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:11,614
<i>then I got to call back that money.</i>

313
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:13,074
Yeah, how much money was that?

314
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:16,077
<i>320,000.
I got to correlate that money</i>

315
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,620
<i>with the cars it's being lent on.</i>

316
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:19,831
Yeah. Okay, no problem.
I'll just fax that right over.

317
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:20,873
<i>No, no, no. Fax...</i>

318
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,750
I mean, send it over.
I'll shoot it right over to you, then.

319
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:23,960
<i>Okay, okay. Fine.</i>

320
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:25,920
Okay. Real good, then.

321
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:34,262
<i>- We're back with Katie Carlson.
- Hi.</i> 

322

<i>Now, before we get going here,</i>

323
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,473

331
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,868

is going to show us</i>

332

<i>-Now, Katie, I gotta admit...
- What?</i> 

334
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,542
<i>I was a little bit surprised
when I first picked this up.</i>

335
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:05,585
<i>Right.</i>

336
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:06,711
<i>This is an empty egg.</i>

337
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,004
<i>That's right, Dale.</i>

338
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,088
<i>Well, how do you get the egg...</i>

339
00:18:09,131 --> 00:18:10,381
<i>- There was an egg in here, right?
- Yeah.</i> 

340
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:13,301
<i>Okay, well, I don't...
How do you... I mean, you don't have</i>

341
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:16,345
<i>an empty chicken somewhere
that lays empty eggs?</i>

342
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,472
<i>No, no.</i>

343
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:20,141
<i>I guarantee, this was
an honest-to-goodness...</i>

344
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:36,407
Unguent.

345
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:37,492
What?

346
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,327
I need unguent.

347
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:46,918
No.

348
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:56,052
No...

349
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:20,535
You want to do it?

350
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:21,828
Push.

351
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,848
- How are you, Stan?
- How you doing, Wade?

352
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,850
Good to see you again, Jerry.

353
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:28,519
If these numbers are right,
this looks pretty sweet.

354
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,021
Those numbers are right, all right.

355
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,147
Believe me.

356
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,356
This is doable.

357
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:33,691
Congratulations, Jer.

358
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,651
Yeah, thanks, Stan.
Well, it's a pretty...

359
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:38,821
What kind of finder's fee
were you looking for?

360
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:40,656
Huh?

361
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:43,451
The financials are pretty thorough,

362
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:46,412
so the only thing we don't know 
is your fee.

363
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:47,872
My fee?

364
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,541
Wade, what the heck
are you talking about?

365
00:20:50,626 --> 00:20:52,001
Stan and I are okay.

366
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,920
- Yeah.
- We're good to load in.

367
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:55,421
Yeah.

368
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:59,133
But we never talked about your fee
for bringing it to us.

369
00:20:59,217 --> 00:21:01,552
No, but, Wade, see,
I was bringing you this deal

370
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,054
for you to loan me the money to put in.

371
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,014
It's my deal here, see.

372
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,352
Jerry, we thought you were bringing us
an investment.

373
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:10,645
Yeah. Right.

374
00:21:10,979 --> 00:21:12,605
You're saying...

375
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,273
What are you saying?

376
00:21:14,358 --> 00:21:15,608
You're saying we put in all the money,

377
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,109
and you collect when it pays off.

378
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,697
No, no. See... 
But I'd...

379
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:24,408
I'd pay you back the principal and interest.

380
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:27,161
Heck, I'd go one over prime?

381
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:28,663
We're not a bank, Jerry.

382
00:21:28,747 --> 00:21:30,790
If I wanted bank interest on 750,000,

383
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,876
I'd go to Midwest Federal,
talk to old Bill Diehl.

384
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:35,294
- He's at North Star.
- He's at...

385
00:21:35,379 --> 00:21:37,338
No, no. See, I...

386
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,217
I don't need a finder's fee.
I need...

387
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:43,844
Finder's fee is, what, 10%?

388
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:45,388
Heck, that's not gonna do it for me.

389
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:46,597
I need the principal.

390
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:49,934
Well, Jerry, we're not gonna 
just give you $750,000.

391
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,435
What the heck were you thinking?

392
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,812
If I'm only getting bank interest,

393
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,690
I want complete security.
Heck, FDIC.

394
00:21:55,774 --> 00:21:57,233
I don't see nothing like that here.

395
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:58,859
Yeah, but I...

396
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,947
Okay. I...

397
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,782
I guarantee you your money back.

398
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:08,077
I'm not talking 
about your damn word, Jerry.

399
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,370
Jeez!
What the heck are you...

400
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,163
We're not a bank, Jerry.

401
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:14,208
Well, look. I don't want 
to cut you out of the loop,

402
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:16,669
but this here's a good deal.

403
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:19,088
I assume, if you're not interested,

404
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:22,550
you won't mind
if we move on it independently.

405
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:24,779
Damn it!

406
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:57,269
Hon?

407
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,732
I got the groceries!

408
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:41,689
Yeah, Wade, hi.
It's Jerry. I...

409
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:47,695
Wade, it's Jerry.
I don't know what to do. It's Jean.

410
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:50,406
I don't know what to do.
It's my wife.

411
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,950
I don't know what to do.
It's Jean.

412
00:24:54,995 --> 00:24:58,164
Yeah, Wade, I...
It's Jerry. I...

413
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,960
Wade, it's Jerry.
I... We gotta talk.

414
00:25:03,044 --> 00:25:05,963
It's something... Jeez. 
It's terrible.

415
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:18,434
Yeah, Wade Gustafson, please.

416
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:56,388
Shut the fuck up,

417
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:59,099
or I'll throw you back into the trunk,
you know.

418
00:25:59,184 --> 00:26:02,436
Jesus, that's more than
I've heard you say all week.

419
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:12,071
Shit.

420
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:15,908
Oh, the tags.

421
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:23,624
All right, it's just the tags.

422
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,960
I never put my tags on the car.

423
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:31,006
All right, don't worry.
I'll take care of this.

424
00:26:54,572 --> 00:26:56,240
All right, just keep it
still back there, lady,

425
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:59,785
or else we're gonna have to, 
you know, to shoot you.

426
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:10,087
Hey, I'll take care of this.

427
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:35,529
How can I help you, Officer?

428
00:27:45,332 --> 00:27:46,999
This is a new car, then, sir?

429
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:50,085
It certainly is, Officer.
Still got that smell.

430
00:27:51,212 --> 00:27:53,630
You're required to display
temporary tags,

431
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:56,342
either in the plate area or taped 
to the inside of the back window.

432
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:57,468
Certainly.

433
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:59,928
Can I see your license
and registration, please?

434
00:28:00,013 --> 00:28:01,388
Certainly.

435
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:07,269
Yeah, I was gonna tape up those...
The tag.

436
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:11,982
You know, to be in full compliance,
but it must have...

437
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:14,151
It must have slipped my mind.

438
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,862
So maybe the best thing to do would be

439
00:28:16,946 --> 00:28:19,406
to take care of that
right here in Brainerd.

440
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,618
What's this, sir?

441
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:25,496
My license and registration.

442
00:28:26,581 --> 00:28:28,957
Yeah, I want to be in compliance.

443
00:28:30,794 --> 00:28:33,504
I was just thinking we could take care
of it right here,

444
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,047
in Brainerd.

445
00:28:40,887 --> 00:28:44,056
Put that back in your pocket, please,

446
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,725
and step out of the car,
please, sir.

447
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,376
Shut the fuck up.

448
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:31,019
Whoa.

449
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:34,356
Whoa, daddy.

450
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,319
You'll take care of it.

451
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:45,576
You are smooth, smooth, you know?

452
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:49,037
Oh, daddy.

453
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:53,041
Just clear him off the road.

454
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,085
Yeah.

455
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:50,325
No!

456
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,026
Oh, jeez.

457
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,367
Hi. It's Marge.

458
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,829
Oh, my. Where?

459
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:00,997
Yeah?

460
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:03,709
Oh, jeez.

461
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:07,754
Okay. There in a jiff.

462
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,881
Real good, then.

463
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:20,726
You can sleep.
It's early yet.

464
00:34:21,269 --> 00:34:22,227
Got to go?

465
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:23,478
Yeah.

466
00:34:24,397 --> 00:34:26,273
I'll fix you some eggs.

467
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:28,900
It's okay, hon.
I gotta run.

468
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:31,445
You got to eat a breakfast, Marge.

469
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:35,282
I'll fix you some eggs.

470
00:34:36,325 --> 00:34:38,243
Hon, you can sleep.

471
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,662
You gotta eat a breakfast.

472
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:46,084
I'll fix you some eggs.

473
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:48,378
Norm.

474
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,471
Thanks, hon.
Time to shove off.

475
00:34:58,139 --> 00:34:59,222
Love you, Margie.

476
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:00,599
Love you, hon.

477
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:34,758
Hon?

478
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:35,801
Yeah?

479
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:37,677
Prowler needs a jump.

480
00:35:57,448 --> 00:35:58,824
Hiya, Lou.

481
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:02,327
What you got there?

482
00:36:02,453 --> 00:36:05,455
Margie, thought you might need
a little warm-up.

483
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,290
Thanks a bunch.

484
00:36:07,375 --> 00:36:08,625
So what's the deal now?

485
00:36:08,709 --> 00:36:09,960
Gary says triple homicide?

486
00:36:10,044 --> 00:36:11,294
Yeah, looks pretty bad.

487
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:13,004
Two of them are over here.

488
00:36:13,422 --> 00:36:14,965
Where is everybody?

489
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:17,884
Well, it's cold, Margie.

490
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,138
Watch your step, Margie.

491
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:33,900
Jeez. So...

492
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:36,194
Jeez!

493
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:38,196
Here's the second one!

494
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:41,992
It's in the head and the hand there.

495
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:45,328
I guess that's a defensive wound.

496
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:46,997
Oh, yeah?

497
00:36:47,874 --> 00:36:50,125
Where's the state trooper?

498
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:53,879
Back there a good piece,
in the ditch next to his prowler.

499
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,338
Okay.

500
00:36:56,173 --> 00:36:58,842
So we got a trooper pulls someone over.

501
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:00,343
We got a shooting.

502
00:37:00,428 --> 00:37:01,845
These folks drive by.

503
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:04,514
There's a high-speed pursuit,
ends here,

504
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:06,850
and then this execution-type deal.

505
00:37:06,934 --> 00:37:08,059
Yeah.

506
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:12,522
I'd be very surprised
if our suspect was from Brainerd.

507
00:37:12,607 --> 00:37:13,773
Yeah.

508
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,193
And I'll tell you what.

509
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:20,363
From his footprint,
he looks like a big fella.

510
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:26,411
You see something down there, Chief?

511
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:29,289
No. I just think I'm gonna barf.

512
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:30,498
Jeez.

513
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:33,043
You okay, Margie?

514
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:34,711
Yeah. I'm fine.

515
00:37:37,256 --> 00:37:39,299
It's just morning sickness.

516
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:43,303
Well, that passed.

517
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:44,471
Yeah?

518
00:37:44,555 --> 00:37:46,181
Yeah. Now I'm hungry again.

519
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:48,892
You have breakfast yet, Margie?

520
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:50,435
Oh, yeah.

521
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:52,020
Norm made some eggs.

522
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,229
Yeah?

523
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:55,273
Well...

524
00:37:56,484 --> 00:37:58,443
What now, do you think?

525
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:00,570
Let's go take a look at that trooper.

526
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:05,492
There's different footprints here, Lou.

527
00:38:05,576 --> 00:38:06,618
Yeah?

528
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:09,371
Yeah. This guy's smaller than his buddy.

529
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:10,705
Oh, yeah?

530
00:38:11,499 --> 00:38:13,208
For Pete's sake.

531
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:14,668
How's it look, Marge?

532
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:17,754
Well, he's got his gun
on his hip there,

533
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:20,674
and he looks like a nice enough guy.

534
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:22,759
It's a real shame.

535
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:24,177
Yeah.

536
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:28,640
Didn't monkey with his car there,
did you?

537
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:29,808
No way.

538
00:38:29,892 --> 00:38:31,559
Well, somebody shut his lights.

539
00:38:31,644 --> 00:38:33,019
I guess the little guy sat in there

540
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:34,437
waiting for his buddy to come back.

541
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:36,106
Yeah, it would have been cold out here.

542
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,109
Heck, yeah.
You think is Dave open yet?

543
00:38:39,193 --> 00:38:40,360
Dave?

544
00:38:41,195 --> 00:38:42,862
You don't think he's mixed up in...

545
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:46,282
Oh, no, no. I just want to get Norm
some night crawlers.

546
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:50,996
Did you look in his citation book?

547
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:56,292
Yeah. Last vehicle he wrote in 
was a tan Cierra at 2:18 a.m.

548
00:38:56,377 --> 00:38:58,628
Under plate number he put "DLR."

549
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:00,338
I figure they stopped him or shot him

550
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:03,466
before he could finish
filling out the tag number.

551
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:07,053
So, I got the State looking for a Cierra
with a tag starting "DLR."

552
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:09,222
They don't got no match yet.

553
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:12,308
I'm not sure that I agree with you 100%

554
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:14,394
on your police work there, Lou.

555
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:15,812
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

556
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:19,649
I think that vehicle there
probably had dealer plates.

557
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:21,526
"DLR."

558
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:24,863
Oh.

559
00:39:26,866 --> 00:39:27,991
Jeez.

560
00:39:29,577 --> 00:39:30,994
Say, Lou...

561
00:39:31,078 --> 00:39:32,162
did you hear the one about the guy

562
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:33,788
who couldn't afford personalized plates,

563
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:37,208
so he went and changed his name 
to J3L-2404?

564
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:40,253
Yeah. That's a good one.

565
00:39:47,511 --> 00:39:51,389
<i>Look, all's I know is,
you got a problem, you call a professional.</i>

566
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:53,308
No. They said no cops.

567
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:55,143
They were darn clear on that, Wade.

568
00:39:55,227 --> 00:39:57,187
They said, "You call your cops, 
and we're gonna shoot..."

569
00:39:57,271 --> 00:39:58,688
Of course they're gonna say that.

570
00:39:58,773 --> 00:40:00,815
Where's my protection?
They got Jean here.

571
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,817
If I give these sons of bitches $1 million,

572
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:04,694
where's my guarantee
they're gonna let her go?

573
00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:05,737
Well, they...

574
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:06,905
$1 million is a lot of damn money.

575
00:40:06,989 --> 00:40:08,698
Yeah, but... There they are.
They got my daughter.

576
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:10,283
Think this thing through here, Wade.

577
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:13,286
You give them what they want,
why won't they let her go?

578
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,247
You got to listen to me
on this one, Wade.

579
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:18,124
Heck, you don't know.

580
00:40:18,209 --> 00:40:20,210
You're just whistling Dixie here.

581
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:22,337
I'm saying the cops,
they can advise us on this.

582
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:23,671
I'm saying call a professional.

583
00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:25,673
No. No cops.

584
00:40:26,717 --> 00:40:29,219
That's final.
This is my deal here, Wade.

585
00:40:29,303 --> 00:40:30,303
Yeah.

586
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:32,388
Jean is my wife here.

587
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:35,308
I gotta tell you, Wade,
I'm leaning to Jerry's viewpoint here.

588
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:36,392
Well...

589
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:38,645
We got to protect Jean.
These...

590
00:40:38,729 --> 00:40:40,522
We're not holding any cards here, Wade.

591
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:42,565
They got them all.
So they call the shots.

592
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,733
You're darn tooting.

593
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:44,901
Oh, damn it.

594
00:40:44,985 --> 00:40:46,194
I'm telling you.

595
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:48,655
Well, why don't we...

596
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:52,283
Stan, I'm thinking we should offer them
a half a million.

597
00:40:52,368 --> 00:40:53,785
Now, come on here!

598
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:55,870
No way, Wade.
No way.

599
00:40:55,955 --> 00:40:57,288
We're not horse-trading here, Wade.

600
00:40:57,373 --> 00:40:58,414
Yeah.

601
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:00,166
We gotta just bite the bullet
on this thing.

602
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:01,376
Yeah.

603
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:06,089
So, well, what's the next step here, Jerry?

604
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:08,758
They're gonna call me up
and give me instructions for a drop.

605
00:41:08,843 --> 00:41:10,426
I'm supposed to have the money
ready tomorrow.

606
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:11,678
Damn it!

607
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:15,974
How was everything today?

608
00:41:16,058 --> 00:41:17,851
Yeah. Real good, now.

609
00:41:19,687 --> 00:41:21,187
How you doing?

610
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,150
Okay.
Now, we'll get the money together.

611
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:27,318
Don't worry about it, Jerry.

612
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:31,322
Now, do you want anyone at home with you
till they call?

613
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:32,907
No, I...
They don't...

614
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:34,784
They were just supposed 
to be dealing with me.

615
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:36,035
- They were real clear.
- Yeah. 

616
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,288
You know, they said no one listening in.

617
00:41:38,372 --> 00:41:39,581
They'll be watching.

618
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:41,624
You know, maybe it's all bull,

619
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:44,252
but like you said, Stan,
they're calling the shots.

620
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:45,503
Okay.

621
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:48,548
Now, is Scotty gonna be all right?

622
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:52,343
Yeah. Jeez. Scotty.

623
00:41:52,887 --> 00:41:54,679
Yeah. I'll go talk to him.

624
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:12,530
How you doing there, Scotty?

625
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:14,157
Dad...

626
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:16,910
What are they doing?

627
00:42:17,745 --> 00:42:19,370
What do you think
they're doing with Mom?

628
00:42:19,455 --> 00:42:21,122
It's okay, Scotty.

629
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:22,957
They're not gonna wanna hurt her any.

630
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:25,668
These men, they just want money.

631
00:42:26,337 --> 00:42:28,504
Yeah, well,
what if something goes wrong, Dad?

632
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:32,175
No, no.
Nothing's going wrong here.

633
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:36,471
Granddad and I, we're, we're making sure
this gets handled right.

634
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:39,557
I really think
we should call the cops here.

635
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:42,936
No. No. No one can know 
about this thing.

636
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:45,271
We gotta play ball with these guys.

637
00:42:45,356 --> 00:42:47,482
You ask Stan Grossman,
he'll tell you the same thing.

638
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:48,524
Yeah. But, Dad...

639
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:52,111
We're gonna get Mom back for you,
but we gotta play ball.

640
00:42:52,363 --> 00:42:53,613
You know?

641
00:42:55,157 --> 00:42:57,033
That's the deal here.

642
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:03,957
So if Lorraine calls, or Sylvia,

643
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:07,585
you just say Mom's down in Florida,
with Pearl and Marty.

644
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:13,925
That's the best we can do here.

645
00:43:57,636 --> 00:43:58,970
No!

646
00:44:16,071 --> 00:44:17,113
No!

647
00:44:22,536 --> 00:44:24,287
Oh, God.

648
00:44:40,346 --> 00:44:41,429
Lunchtime.

649
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:42,680
Thanks, Margaret.

650
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:44,515
Hi. Hey.

651
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:46,601
Willy. Carol.

652
00:44:47,353 --> 00:44:49,312
Janie, two more of those
Skin So Soft, please.

653
00:44:49,396 --> 00:44:50,396
Sure thing.

654
00:44:51,899 --> 00:44:53,316
Hiya, hon.

655
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,193
I brought you some lunch, Margie.

656
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,487
What are those?
Night crawlers?

657
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:58,654
Yeah.

658
00:44:58,739 --> 00:44:59,989
Oh, thanks, hon.

659
00:45:00,074 --> 00:45:02,158
You bet.
Thanks for lunch.

660
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:04,369
Yeah.
Looks pretty good.

661
00:45:04,453 --> 00:45:07,330
What do we got here, Arby's?

662
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:08,915
How's the painting going?

663
00:45:08,999 --> 00:45:10,458
Pretty good.

664
00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:13,920
Found out the Hautmans are entering
a painting this year.

665
00:45:14,004 --> 00:45:16,130
Hon, you're better than them.

666
00:45:16,215 --> 00:45:18,091
They're real good.

667
00:45:18,175 --> 00:45:21,260
They're good, Norm,
but you're better than them.

668
00:45:22,262 --> 00:45:23,679
You think so?

669
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:27,600
Hey, you got Arby's all over me.

670
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:32,063
Hiya, Norm.
How's the painting going?

671
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:33,689
Not too bad, you know.

672
00:45:33,774 --> 00:45:35,066
How we doing on that vehicle?

673
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,819
Well, no motels registered
any tan Cierra last night,

674
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:41,322
but the night before,
two men checked into the Blue Ox,

675
00:45:41,407 --> 00:45:44,534
registering a Cierra
and leaving the tag space blank.

676
00:45:44,618 --> 00:45:45,743
Jeez, that's a good lead.

677
00:45:45,828 --> 00:45:46,911
Yeah.

678
00:45:46,995 --> 00:45:49,497
Blue Ox, that's that truckers' joint
out there on I-35?

679
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:52,208
Yeah. Owner was on the desk then.

680
00:45:52,292 --> 00:45:54,210
Said these two had company.

681
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:55,378
Oh, yeah?

682
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:56,629
Yeah.

683
00:46:00,551 --> 00:46:02,844
<i>Yeah, we both did.
She went to college, too.</i>

684
00:46:02,928 --> 00:46:04,804
I went to Normandale for about
a year and a half.

685
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:06,013
Yeah, that's where we met.

686
00:46:06,098 --> 00:46:07,181
But I dropped out, though.

687
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:08,307
Yeah, she dropped.

688
00:46:08,392 --> 00:46:09,434
Yeah.

689
00:46:09,768 --> 00:46:11,227
So where you girls from?

690
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:13,146
- Chaska.
- Le Sueur.

691
00:46:13,230 --> 00:46:15,398
But I went to high school
in White Bear Lake.

692
00:46:15,482 --> 00:46:16,732
Go Bears.

693
00:46:17,526 --> 00:46:21,237
Okay. I want you to tell me 
what these fellows looked like.

694
00:46:21,488 --> 00:46:23,406
Well, the little guy,
he was kind of funny-looking.

695
00:46:23,490 --> 00:46:24,490
In what way?

696
00:46:24,575 --> 00:46:26,492
I don't know.
Just funny-looking.

697
00:46:26,577 --> 00:46:28,911
Can you be any more specific?

698
00:46:28,996 --> 00:46:30,371
I couldn't really say.

699
00:46:30,456 --> 00:46:31,873
He wasn't circumcised.

700
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,793
Was he funny-looking apart from that?

701
00:46:35,878 --> 00:46:37,003
Yeah.

702
00:46:38,297 --> 00:46:41,841
So, you were having sex
with the little fella, then.

703
00:46:42,176 --> 00:46:43,384
Uh-huh.

704
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:45,470
Is there anything else
you can tell me about him?

705
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:48,431
No. Like I say,
he was funny-looking.

706
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:50,558
More than most people, even.

707
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:51,809
What about the other fella?

708
00:46:51,894 --> 00:46:53,060
He was a little older.

709
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:54,896
You know, he looked like
the Marlboro Man.

710
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,606
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

711
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:58,149
But maybe I'm saying that, you know,

712
00:46:58,233 --> 00:47:00,568
'cause he smoked a lot of Marlboros.

713
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:02,445
You know, like a subconscious
type of thing.

714
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:03,696
Oh, yeah, that can happen.

715
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,822
Yeah.

716
00:47:04,907 --> 00:47:06,949
Hey, they said they were going 
to the Twin Cities.

717
00:47:07,034 --> 00:47:08,493
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

718
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:10,077
Yeah, is that useful to you?

719
00:47:10,162 --> 00:47:11,704
You betcha. Yeah.

720
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:13,122
- Yeah.
- Yeah. 

721
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:16,459
<i>Come on!</i>

722
00:47:17,669 --> 00:47:18,920
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

723
00:47:21,215 --> 00:47:22,882
Jesus Christ.

724
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,385
Fucking shitbox.

725
00:47:27,804 --> 00:47:29,555
Been here for days.

726
00:47:30,891 --> 00:47:32,767
Damn it.
Nothing to do.

727
00:47:34,061 --> 00:47:36,103
Fucking TV doesn't even...

728
00:47:38,065 --> 00:47:41,817
Damn it, come on! Plug me in, man.
Give me a fucking signal.

729
00:47:43,612 --> 00:47:45,321
Goddamn it!

730
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:49,784
Unbelievable! Come on!

731
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:51,327
God...

732
00:47:52,162 --> 00:47:53,329
Fuck!

733
00:47:53,413 --> 00:47:56,707
Come on, plug me into the ozone, baby! 
Come on!

734
00:47:58,252 --> 00:47:59,544
Come on!

735
00:48:01,338 --> 00:48:03,089
Fuck! Fuck!

736
00:48:04,216 --> 00:48:05,675
Fuck! Fuck!

737
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:15,851
<i>The bark beetle carries the worm 
to its nest</i>

738
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,231
<i>where it will feed its young
for up to six months.</i>

739
00:48:22,943 --> 00:48:26,195
<i>In the spring, the larvae hatch,
and the cycle begins again.</i>

740
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,530
Well...

741
00:48:28,824 --> 00:48:30,700
I'm turning in, Norm.

742
00:48:31,201 --> 00:48:32,535
Oh, yeah?

743
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:37,790
<i>Here it is, 
throwing off the larval envelope.</i>

744
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:52,888
Hello?

745
00:48:52,973 --> 00:48:54,974
<i>Yeah. Is this Marge?</i>

746
00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:56,309
Yeah.

747
00:48:56,393 --> 00:48:58,019
<i>Margie Olmstead?</i>

748
00:48:59,104 --> 00:49:01,230
Yeah. Who's this?

749
00:49:01,315 --> 00:49:03,566
<i>This is Mike Yanagita!</i>

750
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:06,235
<i>You know, Mike Yanagita.
Remember me?</i>

751
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:10,156
Mike Yanagita?

752
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:11,657
<i>Yeah!</i>

753
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:14,368
Well, yeah!

754
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:16,662
Course I remember you.

755
00:49:16,747 --> 00:49:19,206
How are you doing?
What time is it?

756
00:49:19,291 --> 00:49:21,709
<i>Oh, jeez. It's 10:45.</i>

757
00:49:21,793 --> 00:49:23,169
<i>I hope I didn't wake you.</i>

758
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:26,005
No. That's okay.

759
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:28,174
<i>Yeah, I'm down in the Twin Cities,</i>

760
00:49:28,258 --> 00:49:31,135
<i>and I was just watching on TV 
about these shootings up in Brainerd.</i>

761
00:49:31,219 --> 00:49:32,720
<i>And I saw you on the news there.</i>

762
00:49:32,804 --> 00:49:33,846
Yeah.

763
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:35,473
<i>I thought, 
"Jeez, is that Margie Olmstead?"</i>

764
00:49:35,557 --> 00:49:36,724
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

765
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:39,101
Yeah, that's me.

766
00:49:39,853 --> 00:49:41,520
<i>Well, how the heck are you?</i>

767
00:49:41,605 --> 00:49:43,230
Okay. You know.

768
00:49:44,107 --> 00:49:45,107
Okay.

769
00:49:45,192 --> 00:49:46,692
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Yeah.

770
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:48,778
How you doing?

771
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:50,488
<i>Pretty good.</i>

772
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:53,115
Well, heck.

773
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,534
It's been such a long time, Mike.

774
00:49:56,328 --> 00:49:58,412
It's great to hear from you.

775
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,626
Yeah, you got your...

776
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,796
This is loaded here.
This has your independent...

777
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,216
Your front-wheel drive,
rack-and-pinion steering,

778
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,219
antilock brakes, alarm, radar,

779
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,305
and I can give it to you
with a heck of a sealant.

780
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:18,641
This TruCoat stuff,
it'll keep the salt off.

781
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:20,559
Yeah, I don't need no sealant, though.

782
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:22,478
Yeah. You don't need that.

783
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:24,313
Now, were you thinking
of financing here?

784
00:50:24,398 --> 00:50:27,024
You ought to be aware
of this GMAC plan they have now.

785
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:28,150
It's really super.

786
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:29,402
Got a call for you, Jerry.

787
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:30,861
Yeah, okay.

788
00:50:37,786 --> 00:50:38,953
Jerry Lundegaard.

789
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:41,163
<i>All right, Jerry,
you got the phone to yourself?</i>

790
00:50:41,248 --> 00:50:42,331
Well, yeah.

791
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:43,457
<i>You know who this is?</i>

792
00:50:43,542 --> 00:50:45,501
Well, yeah, I got an idea.

793
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:47,461
How's that Cierra working out for you?

794
00:50:47,546 --> 00:50:49,797
<i>Circumstances have changed, Jerry.</i>

795
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,006
Well...

796
00:50:51,883 --> 00:50:52,883
What do you mean?

797
00:50:52,968 --> 00:50:56,679
<i>Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry, 
beyond the acts of God.</i>

798
00:50:56,763 --> 00:50:57,847
<i>Force majeure.</i>

799
00:50:57,931 --> 00:50:59,181
What the...

800
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:00,599
How's Jean?

801
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,060
<i>Who's Jean?</i>

802
00:51:03,145 --> 00:51:05,104
My wife. What the...

803
00:51:05,188 --> 00:51:07,231
<i>She's all right, but there's 
three people up in Brainerd</i>

804
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:08,524
<i>who aren't so okay,
I'll tell you that.</i>

805
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:09,775
What the heck are you talking about?

806
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,485
Let's just finish this deal up here.

807
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:13,738
<i>Blood has been shed, Jerry.</i>

808
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:15,531
What the heck do you mean?

809
00:51:15,615 --> 00:51:17,491
<i>Three people in Brainerd.</i>

810
00:51:17,576 --> 00:51:18,617
Oh, jeez.

811
00:51:18,702 --> 00:51:20,745
<i>That's right,
and we need more money.</i>

812
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:22,037
What the heck are you talking about?

813
00:51:22,122 --> 00:51:24,039
What do you fellas got yourself 
mixed up in?

814
00:51:24,124 --> 00:51:25,166
<i>We need more money...</i>

815
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,293
This was supposed to be
a no-rough-stuff type deal.

816
00:51:27,377 --> 00:51:29,962
<i>Don't ever interrupt me, Jerry!
Just shut the fuck up!</i>

817
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:32,214
Well, I'm sorry, but I just, I...

818
00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:34,425
<i>I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
I'm not gonna debate!</i>

819
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:36,051
<i>We now want the entire 80,000.</i>

820
00:51:36,136 --> 00:51:38,012
Oh, for Christ's sake here.

821
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:39,305
<i>Blood has been shed.</i>

822
00:51:39,389 --> 00:51:40,639
<i>We've incurred risk, Jerry.</i>

823
00:51:40,724 --> 00:51:41,891
<i>I'm coming into town tomorrow.</i>

824
00:51:41,975 --> 00:51:43,058
<i>You have the money ready.</i>

825
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:45,561
Now, we had a deal here.
A deal's a deal.

826
00:51:45,645 --> 00:51:46,687
<i>Is it, Jerry?</i>

827
00:51:46,772 --> 00:51:48,939
<i>You ask those three poor souls 
up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal.</i>

828
00:51:49,024 --> 00:51:50,149
<i>Go ahead, ask them!</i>

829
00:51:50,233 --> 00:51:51,275
The heck do you mean?

830
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:53,778
<i>"The heck do you mean?"
I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

831
00:51:58,033 --> 00:51:59,033
Yeah?

832
00:51:59,117 --> 00:52:00,159
<i>Jerome Lundegaard?</i>

833
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:01,285
Yeah.

834
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:03,037
<i>This is Reilly Diefenbach at GMAC.</i>

835
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:05,873
<i> Sir, I've not received
those vehicle IDs you promised.</i>

836
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:07,291
Yeah. I...

837
00:52:07,709 --> 00:52:08,959
Those are in the mail.

838
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:11,796
<i>That very well may be.
I must inform you, however,</i>

839
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,673
<i>that absent the receipt
of those numbers by tomorrow afternoon,</i>

840
00:52:14,758 --> 00:52:17,259
<i>I will have to refer this matter 
to our legal department.</i>

841
00:52:17,344 --> 00:52:18,385
Yeah.

842
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:20,221
<i>- My patience is at an end.</i> 
- Yeah.

843
00:52:20,305 --> 00:52:21,806
<i>- Good day, sir.</i>
- Yeah.

844
00:53:20,657 --> 00:53:23,117
Hi, Norm.
How you doing, Margie? 

845
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:25,202
How's the fricassee?

846
00:53:25,287 --> 00:53:26,745
Pretty darn good.
You want some?

847
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,080
Oh, no. I got...

848
00:53:28,164 --> 00:53:32,126
Hey, Norm, I thought you was going 
ice fishing up at Mille Lacs.

849
00:53:32,794 --> 00:53:34,503
Yeah. After lunch.

850
00:53:34,963 --> 00:53:36,297
What you got there?

851
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:38,799
The numbers you asked for.

852
00:53:38,884 --> 00:53:41,552
Calls made from the lobby pay phone
at the Blue Ox.

853
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:43,679
Two to Minneapolis that night.

854
00:53:43,763 --> 00:53:45,097
First one's a trucking company

855
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:47,057
and second one's a private residence,

856
00:53:47,142 --> 00:53:48,809
a Shep Proudfoot.

857
00:53:49,936 --> 00:53:51,186
A what?

858
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:53,522
Shep Proudfoot.
That's a name.

859
00:53:54,274 --> 00:53:55,482
Yeah.

860
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:58,235
Okay. Yeah.

861
00:53:59,321 --> 00:54:01,196
Think I'll take a drive
down there, then.

862
00:54:01,281 --> 00:54:03,198
Oh, yeah?
Twin Cities.

863
00:54:05,952 --> 00:54:07,244
Oh, yeah?

864
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:24,303
Damn it, I want to be a part 
of this thing.

865
00:54:24,387 --> 00:54:26,597
No. Wade, they were real clear.

866
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:28,557
They said they'd call tomorrow
with instructions,

867
00:54:28,642 --> 00:54:30,517
and it's gotta be delivered 
by me alone.

868
00:54:30,602 --> 00:54:32,853
It's my money, I'll deliver it.

869
00:54:33,355 --> 00:54:34,647
What do they care?

870
00:54:34,731 --> 00:54:36,023
Wade's got a point, there.

871
00:54:36,107 --> 00:54:37,566
I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.

872
00:54:37,651 --> 00:54:38,901
No, no. See, they...

873
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:41,236
No. See, they only deal with me.

874
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:45,074
You feel this nervousness
on the phone there.

875
00:54:45,158 --> 00:54:47,868
They're very...
These guys are dangerous.

876
00:54:47,953 --> 00:54:50,454
All the more reason.
I don't want you...

877
00:54:50,538 --> 00:54:53,415
With all due respect, Jerry,
I don't want you mucking this up.

878
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:54,500
What the heck do you mean?

879
00:54:54,584 --> 00:54:56,126
They want my money,
they can deal with me.

880
00:54:56,211 --> 00:54:57,711
Otherwise, I'm going to a professional.

881
00:54:57,796 --> 00:54:59,421
No, see...
There's $1 million here.

882
00:54:59,506 --> 00:55:00,589
No. See...

883
00:55:00,674 --> 00:55:03,467
Look, Jerry,
you're not selling me a damn car!

884
00:55:03,551 --> 00:55:05,886
It's my show here.
That's that!

885
00:55:07,597 --> 00:55:10,557
It's the way we'd prefer
to handle it, Jerry.

886
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:18,649
Hi. How you doing?

887
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:20,442
Real good.
How are you doing today, ma'am?

888
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:22,778
I'm doing really super there. 
Thanks.

889
00:55:22,862 --> 00:55:25,698
I'm Mrs. Gunderson.
I have a reservation.

890
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:29,201
Yep.
You sure do, Mrs. Gunderson.

891
00:55:29,869 --> 00:55:32,204
Is there a phone down here, you think?

892
00:55:34,374 --> 00:55:36,041
Detective Sibert?

893
00:55:36,126 --> 00:55:39,670
Yeah, this is Marge Gunderson
from up Brainerd. We spoke.

894
00:55:40,422 --> 00:55:42,965
Yeah. Well, actually,
I'm in town here.

895
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:45,009
I had to do a few things
in the Twin Cities,

896
00:55:45,093 --> 00:55:46,677
so I thought I'd check in with you

897
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:49,263
about that USFI search
on Shep Proudfoot.

898
00:55:51,016 --> 00:55:52,307
Oh, yeah?

899
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:56,353
Well, maybe I'll go visit with him
if I have...

900
00:55:56,438 --> 00:55:58,313
No. I can find that.

901
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:00,482
Yeah. Well, thanks a bunch.

902
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:03,360
Say, say, would you happen to know

903
00:56:03,445 --> 00:56:06,363
a good place for lunch
in the downtown area?

904
00:56:07,198 --> 00:56:08,657
The Radisson.

905
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:11,744
Oh, yeah?
Is it reasonable?

906
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:30,948
Hi. How you doing?

907
00:57:31,032 --> 00:57:33,492
Yeah. I decided not to park here.

908
00:57:33,952 --> 00:57:36,161
Well, what do you mean?
You decided not to park here?

909
00:57:36,246 --> 00:57:39,081
Yeah, I just came in and I decided
not to park here, so...

910
00:57:39,165 --> 00:57:41,834
But...
Well, I'm sorry, sir...

911
00:57:41,918 --> 00:57:44,211
Yeah, I decided not to... I...

912
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,296
You know, I'm not...

913
00:57:46,381 --> 00:57:48,715
I decided not to take the trip,
as it turns out, so...

914
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,010
Well, I'm sorry, sir,
we still got to charge you the $4.

915
00:57:53,847 --> 00:57:55,139
I just pulled in here.

916
00:57:55,265 --> 00:57:56,598
I just fucking pulled in here.

917
00:57:56,683 --> 00:57:57,766
Well, but...

918
00:57:57,851 --> 00:58:00,310
See, there's a minimum charge of $4.

919
00:58:00,395 --> 00:58:03,188
Long-term parking charges by the day.

920
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:11,029
I guess you think you're, you know,
like an authority figure.

921
00:58:11,114 --> 00:58:13,448
That stupid fucking uniform,
huh, buddy?

922
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:14,950
King clip-on tie there.

923
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:16,451
Big fucking man, huh?

924
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:19,329
You know, these are the limits 
of your life, man.

925
00:58:19,414 --> 00:58:20,789
Ruler of your little fucking gate here.

926
00:58:20,874 --> 00:58:23,500
Here. There's your $4,
you pathetic piece of shit.

927
00:58:26,087 --> 00:58:27,588
Where's Shep?

928
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,506
Talking to a cop.

929
00:58:29,591 --> 00:58:30,757
Cop?

930
00:58:31,092 --> 00:58:32,843
Said she was a cop.

931
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:38,307
So do you remember getting a call
Wednesday night?

932
00:58:38,391 --> 00:58:39,516
Nope.

933
00:58:40,143 --> 00:58:43,395
You do reside there 
at 1425 Freemont Terrace?

934
00:58:43,479 --> 00:58:44,479
Yep.

935
00:58:44,564 --> 00:58:46,565
Anyone else residing there?

936
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:47,733
No.

937
00:58:47,817 --> 00:58:51,820
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call 
came in past 3:00 in the morning.

938
00:58:51,905 --> 00:58:56,033
It's just hard for me to believe 
you don't remember anyone calling.

939
00:58:56,534 --> 00:58:58,827
Now, I know you've had some problems.

940
00:58:58,912 --> 00:59:00,746
Struggling with the narcotics,

941
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:03,749
some other entanglements,
currently on parole.

942
00:59:04,459 --> 00:59:05,459
So?

943
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:06,960
Well, associating with criminals,

944
00:59:07,045 --> 00:59:08,295
if you're the one they talked to,

945
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:11,506
that right there would be a violation
of your parole.

946
00:59:11,591 --> 00:59:14,092
Would end you up back in Stillwater.

947
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:16,511
Now, I saw some rough stuff
on your priors,

948
00:59:16,596 --> 00:59:18,180
but nothing in the nature of a homicide.

949
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:22,267
I know you don't want to be an accessory
to something like that.

950
00:59:24,229 --> 00:59:25,354
So, you think you might remember

951
00:59:25,438 --> 00:59:27,940
who those folks were who called you?

952
00:59:36,824 --> 00:59:38,075
Mr. Lundegaard?

953
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:39,368
Yeah.

954
00:59:39,452 --> 00:59:41,328
Could I take just a minute
of your time here?

955
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:43,205
What is it all about?

956
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:44,957
Do you mind if I sit down?

957
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:47,084
Carrying quite a load here.

958
00:59:47,293 --> 00:59:49,169
You're the owner here,
Mr. Lundegaard?

959
00:59:49,254 --> 00:59:51,588
No. I...
Executive Sales Manager.

960
00:59:51,673 --> 00:59:53,507
Well, you can help me.
My name's Marge Gunderson.

961
00:59:53,591 --> 00:59:55,717
My father-in-law, he's the owner.

962
00:59:55,802 --> 00:59:56,969
Uh-huh.

963
00:59:57,053 --> 00:59:59,054
Well, I'm a police officer
from up Brainerd,

964
00:59:59,138 --> 01:00:00,889
investigating some malfeasance.

965
01:00:00,974 --> 01:00:03,433
And I was just wondering
if you'd had any new vehicles

966
01:00:03,518 --> 01:00:06,603
stolen off the lot
in the past couple of weeks.

967
01:00:07,814 --> 01:00:10,148
Specifically a tan Cutlass Cierra.

968
01:00:14,737 --> 01:00:16,280
Mr. Lundegaard.

969
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:20,158
Brainerd.

970
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:22,244
Yeah, yeah.

971
01:00:22,328 --> 01:00:24,830
Home of Paul Bunyan, Babe, the Blue Ox.

972
01:00:24,914 --> 01:00:26,581
Babe, the Blue Ox.

973
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,797
Yeah, you know,
we got that big statue up there.

974
01:00:36,301 --> 01:00:39,928
So, you haven't had any vehicles
go missing, then?

975
01:00:40,013 --> 01:00:41,513
Nope. No, ma'am.

976
01:00:42,432 --> 01:00:43,724
Okey-dokey.
Thanks a bunch.

977
01:00:43,808 --> 01:00:46,810
I'll let you get back
to your paperwork, then.

978
01:01:00,992 --> 01:01:02,534
<i>- Service.</i>
- Yeah, get me Shep.

979
01:01:02,618 --> 01:01:03,869
<i>He's not here right now.</i>

980
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:04,995
What the heck do you mean?

981
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:06,621
<i>He stepped out.</i>

982
01:01:06,706 --> 01:01:08,165
- Where'd he go? It's only...
<i>- I'll get you Artie.</i>

983
01:01:08,249 --> 01:01:11,418
No. I don't need a mechanic. 
I need a...

984
01:01:13,963 --> 01:01:17,507
Jeez. I gotta talk to a friend of his,

985
01:01:17,967 --> 01:01:19,551
so...

986
01:01:20,178 --> 01:01:22,220
Have him...

987
01:01:23,556 --> 01:01:24,639
<i>What?</i>

988
01:01:24,724 --> 01:01:25,724
Oh, jeez.

989
01:01:46,579 --> 01:01:47,704
Mike?

990
01:01:48,581 --> 01:01:49,706
Marge?

991
01:01:51,626 --> 01:01:54,336
Jeez! Oh, you look great!

992
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,671
Yeah. So do you.
Easy there. Easy...

993
01:01:56,756 --> 01:02:00,092
Easy there. Easy there.
You do, too. 

994
01:02:00,176 --> 01:02:01,802
I'm expecting now.

995
01:02:01,886 --> 01:02:04,096
I see that. That's great.

996
01:02:04,180 --> 01:02:05,555
What can I get you?

997
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,516
Just a Diet Coke, please.

998
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,184
Great.

999
01:02:09,936 --> 01:02:11,228
This is a nice place.

1000
01:02:11,312 --> 01:02:14,773
Yeah. You know, it's the Radisson,
so it's pretty good.

1001
01:02:14,941 --> 01:02:15,982
Yeah.

1002
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:21,530
So...

1003
01:02:22,281 --> 01:02:23,698
You're living in Edina, then?

1004
01:02:23,783 --> 01:02:25,867
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A couple of years now.

1005
01:02:25,952 --> 01:02:27,702
It's actually Eden Prairie.

1006
01:02:27,787 --> 01:02:29,329
That school district.

1007
01:02:29,747 --> 01:02:32,416
So, Chief Gunderson, then!

1008
01:02:32,792 --> 01:02:35,377
So, you went and married
Norm son-of-a-Gunderson.

1009
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:37,129
Oh, yeah. Long time ago.

1010
01:02:37,213 --> 01:02:38,839
Great, great.

1011
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:41,633
So, what brings you down?

1012
01:02:42,135 --> 01:02:43,844
Are you down here on that homicide,

1013
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:46,179
if you're allowed, you know,
to discuss that?

1014
01:02:46,264 --> 01:02:47,556
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1015
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:50,434
But there's not a heck 
of a lot to discuss.

1016
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:52,853
Okay.

1017
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:54,229
Well, what about you, Mike?

1018
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:55,564
Are you married?

1019
01:02:55,648 --> 01:02:56,731
You got kids?

1020
01:02:56,816 --> 01:02:58,608
Yeah, yeah. Well...

1021
01:02:59,152 --> 01:03:01,862
I was married.
I was married to...

1022
01:03:01,946 --> 01:03:03,864
You mind if I sit over here?

1023
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:05,949
I was married to Linda Cooksey.

1024
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:09,119
No. Why don't you sit over there?
I prefer that.

1025
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:13,457
Okay.

1026
01:03:16,335 --> 01:03:17,419
Sorry.

1027
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:20,255
No, no. Just so I can see you.
Don't have to turn my neck.

1028
01:03:20,339 --> 01:03:22,591
Sure, sure. I understand.

1029
01:03:23,843 --> 01:03:25,093
I didn't mean to...

1030
01:03:25,178 --> 01:03:28,638
No, no. That's fine.

1031
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:33,185
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

1032
01:03:34,061 --> 01:03:36,605
So, I was married to Linda Cooksey.

1033
01:03:36,689 --> 01:03:39,483
You remember Linda.
She was a year behind us.

1034
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:41,026
Yeah. I think I remember her.

1035
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:43,904
Yeah! She...
Oh, yeah!

1036
01:03:43,988 --> 01:03:45,572
So, it didn't work out, huh?

1037
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:49,201
And then I've been working for Honeywell
for a few years now.

1038
01:03:49,285 --> 01:03:50,452
Well, they're a good outfit.

1039
01:03:50,536 --> 01:03:54,289
Yeah, if you're an engineer, yeah,
you could do a lot worse.

1040
01:03:54,373 --> 01:03:56,041
But it's not...

1041
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:58,293
It's nothing like your achievement.

1042
01:03:58,377 --> 01:04:01,379
Well, it sounds like
you're doing really super.

1043
01:04:01,464 --> 01:04:03,048
It's not that...

1044
01:04:03,132 --> 01:04:06,384
It's not that things didn't work out. 
It's...

1045
01:04:07,803 --> 01:04:10,597
Linda had leukemia, you know.

1046
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:13,517
She was...
She passed away.

1047
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:15,018
No.

1048
01:04:17,438 --> 01:04:18,563
It was tough.

1049
01:04:18,648 --> 01:04:19,940
There you go.

1050
01:04:20,399 --> 01:04:22,067
It was long...

1051
01:04:23,444 --> 01:04:26,071
She fought real hard, Marge.

1052
01:04:26,948 --> 01:04:28,323
You know...

1053
01:04:29,075 --> 01:04:30,659
So, what can you say?

1054
01:04:33,621 --> 01:04:35,914
Better times, huh?

1055
01:04:35,998 --> 01:04:37,457
Better times.

1056
01:04:40,044 --> 01:04:44,881
And then I saw you on the TV
and I remembered, you know?

1057
01:04:45,091 --> 01:04:46,758
I always liked you.

1058
01:04:46,842 --> 01:04:48,093
Well, I always liked you...

1059
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:49,928
I always liked you so much.

1060
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,893
So, Mike, should we get together
another time, you think?

1061
01:04:56,978 --> 01:04:58,311
No! I...

1062
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:04,317
I'm sorry. It's...

1063
01:05:04,402 --> 01:05:06,778
You know,
I shouldn't have done this.

1064
01:05:06,862 --> 01:05:08,905
I shouldn't have done this.
I shouldn't.

1065
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:11,533
I thought we'd have
a really terrific time.

1066
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:13,034
It's okay, Mike.

1067
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,620
You were such a super lady.

1068
01:05:15,705 --> 01:05:18,957
And then...
I've been so lonely.

1069
01:05:21,836 --> 01:05:23,336
It's okay, Mike.

1070
01:05:29,677 --> 01:05:33,513
<i>Here's a song I dedicate 
to all the ladies out here tonight.</i>

1071
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:35,807
Goes like this.

1072
01:05:36,684 --> 01:05:39,728
<i>Let's find each other tonight</i>

1073
01:05:40,563 --> 01:05:42,981
<i>Everything will be all right</i>

1074
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,318
<i>Don't hesitate now</i> 

1075
01:05:46,402 --> 01:05:48,069
<i>Let's find each other tonight</i>

1076
01:05:48,195 --> 01:05:49,487
So...

1077
01:05:50,156 --> 01:05:52,115
Are you from around here?

1078
01:05:52,908 --> 01:05:54,743
Just in town on business.

1079
01:05:55,328 --> 01:05:56,411
Just in and out.

1080
01:05:59,165 --> 01:06:01,708
Just a little of the old in-and-out.

1081
01:06:02,835 --> 01:06:04,252
What do you do?

1082
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:06,588
I...

1083
01:06:10,593 --> 01:06:12,093
You been to the Celebrity Room before?

1084
01:06:12,178 --> 01:06:14,137
With other clients?

1085
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:16,097
I don't think so.

1086
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:17,641
It's nice.

1087
01:06:17,725 --> 01:06:20,185
Yeah, well, depends on the artist.

1088
01:06:20,353 --> 01:06:23,480
You know, Jose Feliciano,
you got no complaints.

1089
01:06:24,106 --> 01:06:25,190
Waiter!

1090
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:29,027
What is he, deaf?

1091
01:06:29,862 --> 01:06:31,112
So...

1092
01:06:32,198 --> 01:06:34,574
How long you work
for the escort service?

1093
01:06:34,659 --> 01:06:36,743
I don't know. A few months.

1094
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:40,330
Find that work interesting, do you?

1095
01:06:41,415 --> 01:06:43,458
What are you talking about?

1096
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:45,293
Right.

1097
01:06:45,378 --> 01:06:46,711
Come on.

1098
01:06:46,796 --> 01:06:48,797
I'm hearing bells.
Come on.

1099
01:06:50,633 --> 01:06:53,176
All right. Where were you?

1100
01:06:57,390 --> 01:07:00,809
Shep, what the hell are you doing?
I'm banging that girl.

1101
01:07:00,893 --> 01:07:05,271
Fucking asshole.
Get the fuck out of here.

1102
01:07:05,398 --> 01:07:08,358
Put me back in Stillwater,
you little fucking shithead.

1103
01:07:08,442 --> 01:07:09,984
Get the fuck out of here.

1104
01:07:11,195 --> 01:07:13,071
Yo! Cut that shit out, man.

1105
01:07:13,155 --> 01:07:15,115
Trying to get some goddamn sleep here.

1106
01:07:16,242 --> 01:07:17,283
Come on, brother...

1107
01:07:17,368 --> 01:07:18,618
Fuck you!

1108
01:07:25,042 --> 01:07:26,459
Fuck you.

1109
01:07:26,544 --> 01:07:27,711
Animals!

1110
01:07:29,714 --> 01:07:31,339
Stay away from me, man.

1111
01:07:31,424 --> 01:07:33,508
Hey, smoke a fucking peace pipe!

1112
01:07:33,592 --> 01:07:35,468
Don't you dare fucking hit me!

1113
01:07:42,893 --> 01:07:44,602
Fucking little weasel!

1114
01:07:44,687 --> 01:07:46,396
- Fuck you, man.
- Stop it! 

1115
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,316
You fucking, motherfucking,
son-of-a-bitching, fucking cock!

1116
01:07:50,401 --> 01:07:54,028
Jesus Christ! 
You fucking shitbag motherfucker!

1117
01:07:57,992 --> 01:07:58,992
<i>Yeah?</i>

1118
01:07:59,076 --> 01:08:00,285
All right, Jerry,
I'm through fucking around.

1119
01:08:00,369 --> 01:08:01,453
<i>You got the fucking money?</i>

1120
01:08:01,537 --> 01:08:03,580
Yeah, I got the money, but...

1121
01:08:03,664 --> 01:08:05,373
<i>Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.</i>

1122
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:08,418
<i>I want you to put this money
in the Dayton Radisson parking ramp, top level,</i>

1123
01:08:08,502 --> 01:08:10,044
<i>30 minutes, Jerry,
we wrap this thing up.</i>

1124
01:08:10,129 --> 01:08:11,171
Okay. But...

1125
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:13,506
Hey, you're there in 30 minutes
or I find you, Jerry,

1126
01:08:13,591 --> 01:08:15,049
and I shoot you 
and I shoot your fucking wife,

1127
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:16,426
and I shoot all 
your little fucking children

1128
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:19,012
and I shoot them all in the back 
of their little fucking heads. You got it?

1129
01:08:19,096 --> 01:08:20,889
Okay, now, you stay away from Scotty, now.

1130
01:08:20,973 --> 01:08:22,015
<i>Got it?</i>

1131
01:08:22,099 --> 01:08:23,725
Okay. Real good, then.

1132
01:08:48,793 --> 01:08:50,001
Dad.

1133
01:08:50,628 --> 01:08:52,003
It's okay, Scotty.

1134
01:08:52,087 --> 01:08:53,755
Where you going?

1135
01:08:54,089 --> 01:08:56,174
I'll be back in a minute.

1136
01:08:56,425 --> 01:09:00,762
If Stan calls,
you just tell him I went to Embers.

1137
01:09:03,098 --> 01:09:04,182
Okay.

1138
01:09:04,892 --> 01:09:06,851
Here's your damn money.

1139
01:09:07,645 --> 01:09:09,646
Now, where's my daughter?

1140
01:09:10,272 --> 01:09:11,397
Yeah.

1141
01:09:11,816 --> 01:09:14,692
You goddamn punk!

1142
01:09:31,043 --> 01:09:32,836
Who the fuck are you?

1143
01:09:35,714 --> 01:09:37,465
Who the fuck are you?

1144
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:40,593
I got your damn money.
Now, where's my daughter?

1145
01:09:41,554 --> 01:09:43,179
I am through fucking around!

1146
01:09:43,264 --> 01:09:44,973
Drop that fucking briefcase!

1147
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:46,641
Where's my daughter?

1148
01:09:46,725 --> 01:09:49,060
Fuck you, man!
Where's Jerry?

1149
01:09:49,144 --> 01:09:51,479
I gave simple fucking instructions.

1150
01:09:51,564 --> 01:09:53,273
Where's my damn daughter?

1151
01:09:53,357 --> 01:09:54,649
No Jean, no money.

1152
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:56,651
Drop that fucking money!

1153
01:09:56,735 --> 01:09:58,403
No Jean, no money!

1154
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:02,198
Is this a fucking joke here?

1155
01:10:08,706 --> 01:10:12,166
Oh, jeez.

1156
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:14,335
You happy now, asshole?

1157
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:16,087
What's with you people?

1158
01:10:16,171 --> 01:10:18,047
You fucking imbeciles!

1159
01:10:25,890 --> 01:10:28,016
You fucking shot me!

1160
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:47,220
May I have your ticket, please?

1161
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:49,013
Open the fucking gate!

1162
01:12:28,554 --> 01:12:30,013
Oh, jeez.

1163
01:13:00,252 --> 01:13:01,335
Dad?

1164
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:02,503
Yeah?

1165
01:13:02,963 --> 01:13:04,756
Stan Grossman called.

1166
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:06,382
Yeah. Okay.

1167
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:07,467
Twice.

1168
01:13:07,593 --> 01:13:08,593
Okay.

1169
01:13:10,596 --> 01:13:12,305
Is everything okay?

1170
01:13:12,681 --> 01:13:13,806
Yeah.

1171
01:13:15,601 --> 01:13:17,351
Are you calling Stan?

1172
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,105
Well, I'm...

1173
01:13:22,649 --> 01:13:24,484
I'm going to bed now.

1174
01:14:01,355 --> 01:14:02,522
How you doing?

1175
01:14:02,606 --> 01:14:04,232
- Mr. Mohra?
- Yeah?

1176
01:14:04,566 --> 01:14:05,733
Officer Olson.

1177
01:14:05,818 --> 01:14:07,318
Yeah. Righto.

1178
01:14:08,153 --> 01:14:09,362
Well...

1179
01:14:09,446 --> 01:14:12,615
So I'm tending bar down there at Ecklund 
and Swedlin's last Tuesday,

1180
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:14,408
and this little guy's drinking,

1181
01:14:14,493 --> 01:14:16,536
and he says,
"Where can a guy find some action?

1182
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:18,871
"I'm going crazy out 
there at the lake."

1183
01:14:18,956 --> 01:14:20,414
And I says,
"What kind of action?"

1184
01:14:20,499 --> 01:14:22,708
And he says,
"Woman action. What do I look like?"

1185
01:14:22,793 --> 01:14:24,252
And I says,
"Well, what do I look like?

1186
01:14:24,336 --> 01:14:26,462
"I don't arrange that kind of thing."

1187
01:14:26,547 --> 01:14:29,090
And he says,
"But I'm going crazy out there at the lake."

1188
01:14:29,174 --> 01:14:32,426
And I says,
"Yeah, but this ain't that kind of place."

1189
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:35,972
He says, "Oh, so I get it.
So you think I'm some kind of jerk for asking."

1190
01:14:36,056 --> 01:14:37,598
Only he don't use the word "jerk."

1191
01:14:37,683 --> 01:14:39,267
I understand.
Then he calls me a jerk,

1192
01:14:39,351 --> 01:14:41,769
says the last guy thought he's a jerk
is dead now.

1193
01:14:41,854 --> 01:14:43,437
So, I don't say nothing.

1194
01:14:43,522 --> 01:14:45,439
He says,
"What do you think about that?"

1195
01:14:45,524 --> 01:14:48,943
And I says, "Well, that don't sound 
like too good a deal for him, then."

1196
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:50,069
You got that right.

1197
01:14:50,154 --> 01:14:51,904
Yeah, he says,
"Yeah, that guy's dead,

1198
01:14:51,989 --> 01:14:53,447
"and I don't mean of old age."

1199
01:14:53,532 --> 01:14:57,076
And then he says,
"Jeez, I'm going crazy out there at the lake."

1200
01:14:57,161 --> 01:14:58,161
White Bear Lake?

1201
01:14:58,245 --> 01:15:00,705
Yeah, well, at Ecklund and Swedlin,
that's closer to Moose Lake.

1202
01:15:00,789 --> 01:15:01,956
So I made that assumption.

1203
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:02,999
Sure.

1204
01:15:03,083 --> 01:15:04,876
Anyway, he's drinking at the bar,

1205
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,669
so I don't think
a whole great deal of it,

1206
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:09,797
but then Mrs. Mohra,
she heard about the homicides down here

1207
01:15:09,882 --> 01:15:14,010
and thought I should call it in,
so I called it in.

1208
01:15:16,263 --> 01:15:17,805
End of story.

1209
01:15:18,432 --> 01:15:19,891
Well, what'd this guy look like, anyways?

1210
01:15:19,975 --> 01:15:21,559
Oh, he's a...

1211
01:15:21,685 --> 01:15:23,269
Little guy,
kind of funny-looking.

1212
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:25,605
In what way?

1213
01:15:25,689 --> 01:15:27,648
Just in a general kind of way.

1214
01:15:27,733 --> 01:15:30,318
Okay. Well, thanks a bunch,
Mr. Mohra.

1215
01:15:30,402 --> 01:15:32,111
You're right.
It's probably nothing,

1216
01:15:32,196 --> 01:15:33,362
but thanks for calling her in.

1217
01:15:33,447 --> 01:15:34,697
Sure.

1218
01:15:34,781 --> 01:15:37,366
Looks like she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.

1219
01:15:37,451 --> 01:15:39,744
Oh, yeah.
Got a front coming in.

1220
01:15:39,912 --> 01:15:42,121
Yeah.
You got that right.

1221
01:16:01,475 --> 01:16:02,892
Jesus Christ.

1222
01:18:19,571 --> 01:18:22,990
Valerie, I'm leaving this morning,
back up to Brainerd.

1223
01:18:23,075 --> 01:18:25,493
<i>Well, I'm sorry I won't see you.</i>

1224
01:18:25,744 --> 01:18:26,994
But you think he's all right?

1225
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:28,204
I saw him last night and...

1226
01:18:28,288 --> 01:18:29,330
<i>What did he say?</i>

1227
01:18:29,414 --> 01:18:31,123
Well, it's nothing specific he said.

1228
01:18:31,208 --> 01:18:34,377
It just seemed like it all hit him 
really hard, his wife dying.

1229
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:36,337
<i>- His wife?</i>
- Linda.

1230
01:18:36,463 --> 01:18:38,464
<i>- Who?</i>
- Linda Cooksey.

1231
01:18:38,548 --> 01:18:40,341
<i>No. No, no.
They weren't...</i>

1232
01:18:40,425 --> 01:18:43,344
<i>He was bothering Linda for about...
For a good year.</i>

1233
01:18:43,428 --> 01:18:46,555
<i>Really pestering her,
wouldn't leave her alone.</i>

1234
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:48,140
So...

1235
01:18:48,683 --> 01:18:50,142
He didn't...

1236
01:18:50,685 --> 01:18:51,685
He never...

1237
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:53,479
<i>No! No, they never married.</i>

1238
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:56,023
<i>Mike's had psychiatric problems.</i>

1239
01:18:56,108 --> 01:18:57,525
Oh, my.

1240
01:18:57,609 --> 01:18:59,110
<i>Yeah, he's been struggling.</i>

1241
01:18:59,194 --> 01:19:01,529
<i>He's living with his parents now.</i>

1242
01:19:02,697 --> 01:19:04,031
Oh, jeez.

1243
01:19:04,116 --> 01:19:06,534
<i>Linda's fine.
You should call her.</i>

1244
01:19:06,618 --> 01:19:08,160
Jeez. Well...

1245
01:19:08,787 --> 01:19:09,912
Jeez.

1246
01:19:11,623 --> 01:19:13,290
That's a surprise.

1247
01:19:23,343 --> 01:19:24,510
Hello!

1248
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:08,471
Mr. Lundegaard, sorry to bother you again.
Can I come in?

1249
01:20:08,555 --> 01:20:11,599
Yeah... No.
I'm kind of busy here.

1250
01:20:11,683 --> 01:20:14,185
I understand.
I'll keep it real short, then.

1251
01:20:14,269 --> 01:20:17,104
I'm on my way out of town,
but I was wondering...

1252
01:20:17,189 --> 01:20:18,397
Do you mind if I sit down?

1253
01:20:18,482 --> 01:20:19,607
Carrying a bit of a load here.

1254
01:20:19,691 --> 01:20:20,816
No, I...

1255
01:20:20,901 --> 01:20:22,610
Yeah, it's this vehicle
I asked about yesterday.

1256
01:20:22,694 --> 01:20:23,736
I was just wondering...

1257
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:26,947
Yeah, like I told you,
we haven't had any vehicles go missing.

1258
01:20:27,032 --> 01:20:29,074
Okay. Are you sure?

1259
01:20:30,076 --> 01:20:32,495
'Cause I mean, how do you know?

1260
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:34,246
Because, see,
the crime I'm investigating,

1261
01:20:34,331 --> 01:20:36,499
the perpetrators were driving a car
with dealer plates,

1262
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:37,833
and they called someone who works here,

1263
01:20:37,918 --> 01:20:39,585
so it'd be quite a coincidence
if they weren't,

1264
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:41,462
you know, connected.

1265
01:20:42,088 --> 01:20:43,506
Yeah, I see.

1266
01:20:43,673 --> 01:20:45,007
So, how do you...

1267
01:20:45,091 --> 01:20:47,218
Have you done any kind
of inventory recently?

1268
01:20:47,302 --> 01:20:48,969
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.

1269
01:20:49,054 --> 01:20:51,138
But how do you know that for sure
without doing a...

1270
01:20:51,223 --> 01:20:52,890
Well, I would know.

1271
01:20:53,058 --> 01:20:54,725
I'm the Executive Sales Manager.

1272
01:20:54,809 --> 01:20:56,519
Yeah, but I understand...

1273
01:20:56,603 --> 01:20:58,145
We run a pretty tight ship here.

1274
01:20:58,230 --> 01:20:59,230
I know, but...

1275
01:20:59,314 --> 01:21:01,357
Well, how do they establish that, sir?

1276
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:02,858
I mean, are the cars counted daily,

1277
01:21:02,943 --> 01:21:04,818
or what kind of a routine here?

1278
01:21:04,903 --> 01:21:07,363
Ma'am, I answered your question.

1279
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:12,701
I'm sorry, sir?

1280
01:21:12,786 --> 01:21:15,079
Ma'am, I answered your question.

1281
01:21:15,747 --> 01:21:16,830
I answered the darn...

1282
01:21:16,915 --> 01:21:20,167
I'm cooperating here,
and there's no...

1283
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:26,674
Sir, you have no call
to get snippy with me.

1284
01:21:26,758 --> 01:21:28,300
I'm just doing my job here.

1285
01:21:28,385 --> 01:21:29,552
I'm...

1286
01:21:31,221 --> 01:21:34,473
I'm not...
I'm not arguing here.

1287
01:21:34,558 --> 01:21:36,934
I'm cooperating, and there's no...

1288
01:21:37,018 --> 01:21:39,103
We're doing all we can.

1289
01:21:45,819 --> 01:21:48,612
Sir, could I talk to Mr. Gustafson?

1290
01:21:52,617 --> 01:21:54,118
Mr. Lundegaard.

1291
01:21:57,330 --> 01:22:00,749
Well, heck! If you wanna...
If you wanna play games here,

1292
01:22:00,834 --> 01:22:03,502
I'm working with you
on this thing here, but...

1293
01:22:03,587 --> 01:22:06,505
Okay!
I'll do a damn lot count!

1294
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:07,673
Sir, right now?

1295
01:22:07,757 --> 01:22:09,341
Yeah! Right now.

1296
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:11,802
You're darn tooting!

1297
01:22:12,470 --> 01:22:15,681
If it's so damned important to you.

1298
01:22:16,308 --> 01:22:18,017
Well, I'm sorry, sir.

1299
01:22:18,101 --> 01:22:20,311
What the Christ! Jeez!

1300
01:22:33,825 --> 01:22:36,660
<i>Bob Elcorona, line two.</i>

1301
01:23:05,065 --> 01:23:06,857
For Pete's sake.

1302
01:23:10,528 --> 01:23:12,446
For Pete's sake,
he's fleeing the interview.

1303
01:23:12,530 --> 01:23:14,698
He's fleeing the interview!

1304
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:18,452
How do I get an outside line here?

1305
01:23:20,288 --> 01:23:21,538
All right.

1306
01:23:24,793 --> 01:23:27,086
Yeah. Detective Sibert, please.

1307
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,548
<i>I told you it was over,
and I thought I made myself very clear.</i>

1308
01:23:31,633 --> 01:23:34,426
<i>Oh, you did.
You made yourself perfectly clear.</i>

1309
01:23:34,511 --> 01:23:36,387
<i>But something's come up.</i>

1310
01:23:36,846 --> 01:23:37,930
<i>What?</i>

1311
01:23:38,223 --> 01:23:39,556
<i>Well, it's something kind of small,</i>

1312
01:23:39,641 --> 01:23:41,850
<i>but it might be a big problem.</i>

1313
01:23:41,976 --> 01:23:43,477
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

1314
01:23:45,063 --> 01:23:46,563
<i>I'm pregnant.</i>

1315
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:50,984
<i>I've had a doctor's test,
I've got the certificate,</i>

1316
01:23:51,069 --> 01:23:54,571
<i>and there's no doubt about it,
I'm gonna have your baby.</i>

1317
01:23:57,242 --> 01:23:59,702
<i>Now, look here.
I can explain this.</i>

1318
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:03,247
<i>See, Robin was...
Is a student of mine.</i>

1319
01:24:04,165 --> 01:24:06,417
You should see the other guy.

1320
01:24:07,001 --> 01:24:08,877
<i>No, no, no.
It wasn't anything like that.</i>

1321
01:24:08,962 --> 01:24:10,087
<i>You don't understand!</i> 

1322
01:24:10,171 --> 01:24:11,922
<i>I read that letter that she wrote.</i> 

1323
01:24:12,006 --> 01:24:13,590
<i>I think I understand all there is...</i>

1324
01:24:13,675 --> 01:24:15,426
What happened to her?

1325
01:24:16,761 --> 01:24:19,388
She started shrieking, you know.

1326
01:24:19,472 --> 01:24:20,597
Jeez.

1327
01:24:21,349 --> 01:24:23,434
Well, I got the money.

1328
01:24:23,935 --> 01:24:26,603
All of it, all 80 grand.

1329
01:24:28,773 --> 01:24:31,483
That's 40 for you, 40 for me.

1330
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:35,154
That's it, then.

1331
01:24:39,909 --> 01:24:41,410
You can have my truck.

1332
01:24:41,536 --> 01:24:43,036
I'm taking the Cierra.

1333
01:24:43,121 --> 01:24:44,621
We split that.

1334
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:50,002
How the fuck do you split 
a fucking car, you dummy?

1335
01:24:50,295 --> 01:24:52,296
With a fucking chain saw?

1336
01:24:52,547 --> 01:24:55,215
One of us pays the other for half.

1337
01:24:55,467 --> 01:24:57,968
Hold on.
No fucking way.

1338
01:24:58,845 --> 01:25:00,971
Did you fucking notice this?

1339
01:25:01,806 --> 01:25:03,515
I got fucking shot!

1340
01:25:03,892 --> 01:25:06,143
I got fucking shot in the face!

1341
01:25:06,227 --> 01:25:07,770
I went and got the fucking money!

1342
01:25:07,854 --> 01:25:09,605
I got shot fucking picking it up!

1343
01:25:09,689 --> 01:25:12,399
I've been up for 36 fucking hours!

1344
01:25:13,735 --> 01:25:15,194
I'm taking that fucking car!

1345
01:25:15,278 --> 01:25:18,614
That fuck is mine,
you fucking asshole.

1346
01:25:18,823 --> 01:25:22,117
You know, I've been listening 
to your fucking bullshit all week!

1347
01:25:22,243 --> 01:25:23,744
Are we square?

1348
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:27,623
Are we square?

1349
01:25:29,667 --> 01:25:31,543
Yeah, you fucking mute!

1350
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:35,547
And if you see your friend,
Shep Proudfoot,

1351
01:25:35,632 --> 01:25:38,091
tell him I'm gonna nail his fucking ass.

1352
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:42,471
<i>I'll call you...
Later.</i> 

1353
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:57,361
<i>His wife. This guy says 
she was kidnapped last Wednesday.</i>

1354
01:25:57,445 --> 01:25:58,904
The day of our homicides.

1355
01:25:58,988 --> 01:26:00,072
<i>Yeah.</i>

1356
01:26:00,156 --> 01:26:01,448
And this guy was who?

1357
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:04,159
<i>Lundegaard's father-in-law's accountant.</i>

1358
01:26:04,244 --> 01:26:05,911
Gustafson's accountant.

1359
01:26:05,995 --> 01:26:07,120
<i>Yeah.</i>

1360
01:26:07,205 --> 01:26:08,872
But we still haven't found Gustafson?

1361
01:26:08,957 --> 01:26:10,666
<i>Looking...</i>

1362
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:12,459
Sorry. Didn't copy, Lou.

1363
01:26:12,544 --> 01:26:14,127
<i>Still missing.
We're looking.</i>

1364
01:26:14,212 --> 01:26:16,213
Copy. And Lundegaard, too?

1365
01:26:16,422 --> 01:26:18,841
<i>Yeah.
Where are you, Margie?</i>

1366
01:26:18,925 --> 01:26:20,092
I'm almost back.

1367
01:26:20,176 --> 01:26:21,718
I'm taking a drive around Moose Lake.

1368
01:26:21,803 --> 01:26:23,804
<i>Gary's loudmouth.</i>

1369
01:26:24,097 --> 01:26:25,472
Yeah, the loudmouth.

1370
01:26:25,557 --> 01:26:27,140
So the whole state has it, huh?

1371
01:26:27,225 --> 01:26:29,059
Gustafson and Lundegaard?

1372
01:26:29,143 --> 01:26:30,435
<i>Yeah. It's over the wire.</i>

1373
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,895
<i>It's everywhere.
They'll find them.</i>

1374
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:33,105
Copy. 

1375
01:26:33,565 --> 01:26:34,690
<i>Yeah, we got a lead on this...</i>

1376
01:26:34,774 --> 01:26:36,149
There's the car!
There's the car!

1377
01:26:36,234 --> 01:26:37,234
<i>Whose car?</i>

1378
01:26:37,318 --> 01:26:40,654
My car! My car!
Tan Cierra! Tan Cierra!

1379
01:26:41,239 --> 01:26:44,241
<i>Okay. Careful, Margie.
I'll send a couple cars.</i>

1380
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:38,939
Police!

1381
01:28:46,698 --> 01:28:48,281
Hands up!

1382
01:28:48,574 --> 01:28:49,783
Police!

1383
01:28:53,079 --> 01:28:54,371
Police!

1384
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:57,601
So that was Mrs. Lundegaard
on the floor in there.

1385
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:06,234
And I guess that was your accomplice 
in the wood chipper.

1386
01:30:10,907 --> 01:30:13,325
And those three people in Brainerd.

1387
01:30:18,706 --> 01:30:20,165
And for what?

1388
01:30:21,375 --> 01:30:23,418
For a little bit of money.

1389
01:30:28,966 --> 01:30:32,219
There's more to life than a little money, 
you know?

1390
01:30:41,854 --> 01:30:43,647
Don't you know that?

1391
01:30:50,029 --> 01:30:51,780
And here you are.

1392
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:54,950
And it's a beautiful day.

1393
01:31:04,293 --> 01:31:05,502
Well...

1394
01:31:18,349 --> 01:31:20,433
I just don't understand it.

1395
01:32:02,768 --> 01:32:04,227
Mr. Anderson?

1396
01:32:05,563 --> 01:32:06,813
Who?

1397
01:32:06,898 --> 01:32:10,317
Mr. Anderson, is this
your burgundy '98 out here?

1398
01:32:11,736 --> 01:32:13,195
Just a sec.

1399
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:14,988
Could you open the door, please?

1400
01:32:15,072 --> 01:32:16,990
Yeah, yeah, just a sec.

1401
01:32:17,491 --> 01:32:18,867
Just a sec.

1402
01:32:26,417 --> 01:32:28,376
- Dale!
- My leg!

1403
01:32:28,461 --> 01:32:29,669
No!

1404
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:10,627
They announced it.

1405
01:33:12,213 --> 01:33:13,630
They announced it?

1406
01:33:13,714 --> 01:33:14,839
Yeah.

1407
01:33:15,341 --> 01:33:16,383
So?

1408
01:33:17,385 --> 01:33:19,010
Three-cent stamp.

1409
01:33:19,762 --> 01:33:21,221
Your mallard?

1410
01:33:21,472 --> 01:33:22,514
Yeah.

1411
01:33:23,391 --> 01:33:25,225
That's terrific.

1412
01:33:25,309 --> 01:33:27,269
It's just a three-cent.

1413
01:33:27,812 --> 01:33:28,895
It's terrific.

1414
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:31,690
Hautman's blue-winged teal
got the 29-cent.

1415
01:33:32,316 --> 01:33:34,442
People don't much use the three-cent.

1416
01:33:34,527 --> 01:33:37,112
Oh, for Pete's...
Of course they do.

1417
01:33:38,322 --> 01:33:39,781
Whenever they raise the postage,

1418
01:33:39,865 --> 01:33:41,741
people need the little stamps.

1419
01:33:42,201 --> 01:33:43,576
Yeah?

1420
01:33:43,661 --> 01:33:46,663
When they're stuck
with a bunch of the old ones.

1421
01:33:46,747 --> 01:33:47,998
Yeah.

1422
01:33:48,749 --> 01:33:50,125
I guess.

1423
01:33:51,627 --> 01:33:54,754
That's terrific.
I'm so proud of you, Norm.

1424
01:33:58,301 --> 01:34:01,303
Heck, Norm, you know,
we're doing pretty good.

1425
01:34:03,848 --> 01:34:05,640
I love you, Margie.

1426
01:34:06,684 --> 01:34:08,310
I love you, Norm.

1427
01:34:11,522 --> 01:34:13,148
Two more months.

1428
01:34:16,717 --> 01:34:18,011
Two more months.
