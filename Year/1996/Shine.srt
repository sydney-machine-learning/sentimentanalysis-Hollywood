1
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:21,854
I did, I did,
I thought I was a cat.

2
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:25,607
I identified with cats,
well, I kind of did.

3
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:30,029
I wonder why. Because they're never
sure when you stroke them.

4
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,033
Maybe I was a sad cat.
Was I a sad cat?

5
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:37,828
Truly, I did.
'Cause I was a fuddy-duddy.

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,498
I kissed them.
I always do if they let me.

7
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,669
If I see a cat on a fence,
I will kiss it.

8
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,692
Life's a perpetual risk, isn't it?

9
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:13,197
I was different in those days.
I've got to be different again.

10
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,492
But can a leopard change its spots?

11
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:25,709
It's a blood sport. I think it's
a blood sport. It seems to be true.

12
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,378
Or is it a blank?

13
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:33,217
You've to put the pieces together,
see if you can make a word. Funny!

14
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,845
It's a mystery.

15
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,194
We're closed!

16
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,541
- What's the problem?
- Sorry...

17
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:50,669
I'm the problem!

18
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,547
It's not an ideal world. Is it?

19
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,008
We have to make the most of it.

20
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,761
It's more ideal than it was,
we're privileged.

21
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:03,390
Not long ago people
were burnt to a steak, Moby.

22
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,017
No, Tony.

23
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,895
Tony, not Moby.
Who am I?

24
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,814
Who knows? I'm David, Tony...

25
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:15,194
- How can Sylvia help?
- Is it Sylvia?

26
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:19,781
Pleased to meet you, Sylvia!
Schubert said: "Who is Sylvia?"

27
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:24,369
- What can we do for you?
- I've got to stop talking.

28
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,080
You just tell Sylvia
why you're here.

29
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:33,128
- Are you lost?
- Yes... perhaps I'm lost.

30
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,882
Is that your piano,
beautiful Sylvia?

31
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:40,636
Isn't Sylvia beautiful, Toby?
No, Tony.

32
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:44,139
You're beautiful too.
Could I play it?

33
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,475
- Like hell!
- Shut up, Sam.

34
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:51,188
- The devil! "Diablerie".
- Get out of here!

35
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,441
Tell us who you are
and where you live.

36
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,570
Live and let live.
That's very important.

37
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:02,324
It's a lifelong struggle, isn't it?

38
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,495
To survive undamaged
and not destroy anything.

39
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:11,625
If you do something wrong, you can be
punished for the rest of your life.

40
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:15,796
To keep your head above water
and not get it chopped off.

41
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:20,175
I'm not disappointing you, am I?
Sam, yes!

42
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,681
Helfgott... What a name!

43
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:31,061
Sylvia, Helfgott means
"with the help of God".

44
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,231
My daddy's daddy was religious.

45
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,526
But he got exterminated,
so God didn't help him.

46
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:42,322
That's not funny, it's very sad.
Daddy says I'm callous.

47
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:46,493
Sorry, Silvia, I'm not damaging you?
Perhaps I haven't got a soul.

48
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,788
- What makes you say that?
- Daddy says so.

49
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,000
- That's ridiculous.
- You're right.

50
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:57,421
I'm ridiculous and callous.
Because it was a tragedy.

51
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,090
A ridiculous tragedy.

52
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,602
I'm going to win. I'm going to win.

53
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:18,400
I'm going to win.

54
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:30,287
David's going
to play the piano for us.

55
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:39,379
What are you going to play?

56
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,090
Chopin, the Polonaise!

57
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,748
This is a disgrace!
The piano!

58
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,005
- It's a disgrace!
- This kid's good.

59
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,967
He's great.

60
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,221
He's my son.

61
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,057
My son.

62
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,116
Here they come.

63
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,995
Did he win or lose?

64
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,539
He lost.

65
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,459
Now we'll cop it.

66
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,355
It's your turn.

67
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,275
It's your turn, Daddy.

68
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,280
Let me see...

69
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,873
You're losing.

70
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,293
David, always... win!

71
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,879
Always... win!

72
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:30,675
When I was a boy your age,

73
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,553
I bought a beautiful violin.

74
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,973
I saved for this violin
and know what happened to it?

75
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,351
Yes, he smashed it.

76
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,187
Yeah, he smashed it.

77
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,276
David, you're a very lucky boy.

78
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,155
- My father never let me have music.
- I know.

79
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:56,201
A very lucky boy.
Say it.

80
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,204
I'm a very lucky boy.

81
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:01,831
Very lucky.

82
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:07,837
- Now shall I play for you?
- No, pick up those pieces.

83
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,490
Listen.

84
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,135
Tell your friends not to come.

85
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,828
Hello.

86
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,790
Daddy, there's someone to see you.

87
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,088
Hello. I hope I'm not interrupting.

88
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,885
Ben Rosen. I was one of the judges.

89
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,056
You left before
all the prizes were announced.

90
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,601
- You were very good.
- Thank you.

91
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,269
He can play better.

92
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,606
Maybe he was too good.
Some people don't like that.

93
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,985
We gave him a special prize
for his courage.

94
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,118
- It was a difficult piece.
- Daddy chose it.

95
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,163
Even great pianists
fear the Polonaise.

96
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,583
- A prize for losing.
- I wouldn't call it that.

97
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,460
Enough!

98
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,337
She plays well too.

99
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,550
They all play.

100
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:22,555
David could win lots of competitions

101
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,058
with the right tuition.

102
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,770
- I teach him.
- You've done very well.

103
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:33,942
Yeah, no one taught me.
No music teachers, Mr Rosen.

104
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,694
No, of course...

105
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,030
but bad habits are the difference

106
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:43,201
between winning and losing.
Think about it.

107
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,825
It's Rachmaninov.

108
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,829
It's beautiful.

109
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,749
Yeah. You taught yourself?

110
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,584
From the record.

111
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,465
It's very difficult.

112
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,679
It's the hardest piece
in the world.

113
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,223
Will you teach me?

114
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,527
One day you will play it.
You will make me very proud.

115
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,030
Very proud, won't you, David?

116
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:17,212
Next time what are we going to do?

117
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:22,258
- We're going to win.
- We're going to win. Yes.

118
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,012
Good night.

119
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,847
Good night, Daddy.

120
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:29,200
Come.

121
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,386
Don't touch it!

122
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,979
Mr Rosen,
I would like you to teach David...

123
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,648
...this.

124
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:06,321
- Rachmaninov. Don't be ridiculous!
- But he can play it already.

125
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,824
How can a boy express
that sort of passion?

126
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:14,454
You are a passionate man, Mr Rosen.
You will teach him.

127
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,958
No, I will teach him
what I think is best.

128
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,711
Rachmaninov is best.

129
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,843
- You're his teacher, you decide.
- Thank you.

130
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,725
- We'll start with Mozart.
- I can't afford to pay.

131
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:08,049
- Come on, Sylvia's getting wet.
- Sorry, Sylvia. Bye, Tony.

132
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,510
It's raining cats and dogs!

133
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,690
- You'll be right then?
- Fine. Home sweet home.

134
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:28,069
- You can play.
- Kind of, sweet Sylvia.

135
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:33,157
Chopin, the Pole.
Like Daddy and his family.

136
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:37,537
- How long have you been here?
- I don't know, a few years.

137
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:41,708
There was nothing wrong
with Schubert, except syphillis.

138
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:46,421
Then he got typhoid and we lost him.
A bit careless of us, wasn't it?

139
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:50,800
- So you're back?
- Jim, I've been a naughty boy.

140
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:54,345
I was about
to send out a search party.

141
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:57,473
He came into my restaurant
and seemed lost.

142
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,601
Thanks for bringing him home.

143
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,981
- Bye, David.
- A fine time.

144
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,618
The winner and our youngest
ever State Champion...

145
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,704
David Helfgott!

146
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,086
- We won!
- Thanks to Mozart!

147
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,380
And now he can play Rachmaninov.

148
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,674
And to present David with the prize,

149
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:36,054
our special guest from America,
currently on tour in Australia,

150
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:38,306
Mr Isaac Stern!

151
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,694
You have a very special talent.

152
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:55,031
Thank you, Mr Stern, so do you.

153
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,618
How much are you prepared
to give to your music?

154
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,288
- How much?
- Everything, everything!

155
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:09,212
Everything, but I do like tennis
and chemistry too.

156
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,507
Do you play tennis
as well as you play Mozart?

157
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,051
I play at home.

158
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,970
I bounce the ball against the wall.

159
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:22,558
How would you like to go to a school
in the States to study music?

160
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,227
America?

161
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:28,815
Land of the free, home of the brave.
Mickey Mouse?

162
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:34,195
What an honor for our champion,
an invitation to study in America.

163
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:50,086
And now, all the way from America...

164
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,214
David Helfgott!

165
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,134
- Thank you.
- Not from America.

166
00:18:56,593 --> 00:19:01,556
He's going to America, when he gets
back, he'll be coming from there.

167
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,141
I suppose so.

168
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,904
I have no money
to send him to America.

169
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,993
- We'll raise it.
- What?

170
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,003
Bar Mitzvah.
David hasn't had his yet.

171
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,556
Religion is nonsense.

172
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,850
It's also a goldmine.

173
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,402
One day I'll play with an orchestra.

174
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,781
- Can I come when you do?
- You can ride in my Cadillac.

175
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:03,075
Where will you live in America?

176
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,370
With a nice Jewish family
they said.

177
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,040
This is not a nice family?

178
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,959
Yes, Daddy, it's very nice.

179
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,379
You are very lucky to have a family.

180
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:29,268
I've got to go.

181
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,815
It's one of the finest
music schools in the world.

182
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:39,612
- It is for his father to decide.
- He will be well looked after.

183
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:44,784
Rachel, please. David could be one
of the truly great pianists.

184
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:49,705
He is just a boy, Mr Rosen.
He still wets his bed.

185
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,500
You see how fit and strong I am?

186
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,837
Show me where
the circus lion scratched you.

187
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:48,389
That's what happens when
you get too close to the bars.

188
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,683
David, come.

189
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,020
Hit me.

190
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,982
- As hard as you can.
- I want to hit you, Daddy!

191
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,694
You see, a man of steel.

192
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:06,907
No one can hurt me. In this world
only the fit survive.

193
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,537
- The weak get crushed.
- Like grasshoppers?

194
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,665
If you want to survive in America

195
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,585
you have to be fit and strong.

196
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,130
- Like you, Daddy?
- Yeah.

197
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,841
Like me, yes.

198
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,429
Like me, that's good.

199
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:04,090
- See you next week, David.
- Thank you, Rabbi.

200
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,446
Mr Helfgott,
it is exciting, isn't it?

201
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,366
David, the mayor
is dying to meet you.

202
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,580
- Peter...
- Mr Rosen.

203
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,290
Thank you.

204
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,209
No, thank you.

205
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,756
I would like to thank
our wonderful Lord Mayor

206
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:49,135
for establishing this fund
to send David to America.

207
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:54,515
And now, to play for us,
our very own David Helfgott.

208
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:25,045
These people are a disgrace!
They think they are so important.

209
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:30,009
Their fur and their diamonds...
It makes me sick to the stomach.

210
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,679
And Rosen?
What kind of man is he?

211
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,348
He is not married,
he has no children.

212
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:43,564
- Don't talk to me about Rosen.
- You both want the same thing.

213
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:47,359
Don't compare me to him.
What has he ever suffered in life?

214
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:52,323
What does he know...
What does he know about families?

215
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,953
About how your sisters died

216
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,247
and my mother and father?

217
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:17,825
Thank you, David.
Thank you, Comrade Helfgott.

218
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,286
Your son is a credit to you.

219
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:27,418
On behalf of the Soviet Friendship
Society, we applaud you.

220
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,385
Meet Katherine Pritchard.

221
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,940
- You play beautifully.
- Thank you.

222
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,485
- My name's Sonia.
- I'm David.

223
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,362
I know who you are!

224
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,574
You've got the most wonderful hands.

225
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,702
So do you.

226
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:08,542
- So you're going to America?
- That's right.

227
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,046
Maybe one day you'll go to Russia.

228
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,298
Why not?

229
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,639
I'm here.

230
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,932
There's someone important
to meet you.

231
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,729
I'd better go.

232
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:44,995
I've never met anyone who plays
the piano as beautifully as you do.

233
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,498
I've never met a writer before.

234
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:50,834
- You must be very proud of him.
- Very.

235
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,962
I have a long-suffering
old piano at home.

236
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,299
- A suffering piano?
- From neglect.

237
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:02,096
- Perhaps you'll come and play it.
- Yes, anything to help.

238
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,889
I'd like that very much.

239
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,808
Me too.

240
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,646
Your attention, comrades,
I wish to propose a toast.

241
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,940
That's my cue, excuse me.

242
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,443
To our founder and very special
guest, Katherine Pritchard.

243
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:20,989
You will learn much from her.
She has been to the Soviet Union.

244
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,601
America!

245
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,355
"We have been informed
of your exceptional talent.

246
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:57,359
We would be privileged
to have you stay with us.

247
00:28:57,652 --> 00:29:00,362
You'll feel very much at home here

248
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:04,825
and we are having the Bosendorfer
tuned especially.

249
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,746
- We await your "innement"...
- Imminent. Fool!

250
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,581
Will they have a Cadillac?

251
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,960
"...imminent arrival and look
forward to hearing you play.

252
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:19,047
Kindest wishes,
Simon and Basha Mickleburg."

253
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,384
- Read it again!
- Quiet! You'll wake the baby.

254
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:26,555
"You'll enjoy
the company of our parakeet

255
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,099
and our poodle called Margaret."

256
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,478
Pig! It's not!

257
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,646
Enough!

258
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,940
Turn it off! Give me the letter.

259
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,736
David is not going anywhere.

260
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,491
Daddy!

261
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,828
What are you looking at?
He's not going to America!

262
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:53,457
I won't let anyone destroy
this family!

263
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,876
Please Daddy, don't!

264
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,716
I know what is best
because I am your father.

265
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:07,471
I am your father
and this is your family.

266
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,311
David, come back! Come back!

267
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,315
Why now? Why?

268
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,027
I know what's best.

269
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,781
Believe me. Close the door!

270
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:35,999
Mr Rosen!

271
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,380
Mr Rosen, please, it's David.

272
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,515
Time to get out, David.
It's my turn for the bath.

273
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:36,852
Are you feeling better?
Have you stopped shivering?

274
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,771
A bath is always the best.

275
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,152
Disgusting animal!

276
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,907
To shit in the bath.
To do this to me.

277
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,160
You disgusting animal!

278
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,363
I know you can hear me.

279
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,742
Don't do this to David.

280
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,330
You mustn't stop him going. Peter!

281
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:43,687
Don't you dare
inflict bloody Rachmaninov on him!

282
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,605
He's not ready!

283
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,508
David, my boy.

284
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:18,930
It's a terrible thing
to hate your father.

285
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,935
I know life is cruel...

286
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,855
but music,

287
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:32,277
music will always be your friend.

288
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:35,197
Everything else will let you down.

289
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:38,116
In the end everything, believe me.

290
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:43,497
Don't hate me.

291
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,126
Life is cruel,

292
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,463
but you have to

293
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,634
you have to survive.

294
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,806
You have to survive.

295
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:04,226
Say it.

296
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,563
You have to survive, Daddy.

297
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,868
No one

298
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,122
will love you like me.

299
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,043
You can't trust anyone.

300
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,171
But I will always

301
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,716
be there.

302
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,013
Give me a hug.

303
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,477
I will always be with you.
For ever and ever.

304
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,897
For ever, Daddy.

305
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,545
Each time you play for me

306
00:36:57,048 --> 00:37:01,384
it expresses so completely
the inexpressible.

307
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,138
- Is that good?
- Divine.

308
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,475
Inexpressibly divine.

309
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,856
Tell me a story, Katherine.

310
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,276
- What's the story today?
- A new story.

311
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,362
"Drops of water".

312
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,950
- Raindrops.
- Yes, raindrops.

313
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:44,552
Perfect. I shall treasure this
to the day I die.

314
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:59,985
"To you all these wild weeds

315
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,321
and wind flowers of my life,
I bring, my Lord,

316
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,615
I lay them at your feet.

317
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,243
They're not frankincense or myrrh,

318
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:11,746
but you are Krishna,
Christ and Dionysus.

319
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:16,376
In your beauty,
tenderness and strength."

320
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,874
That was our final contestant,
David Helfgott

321
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,168
with a very stirring Rachmaninov.

322
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,504
What a close contest!

323
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:05,342
The prize will surely go
to one of the two pianists.

324
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:12,098
It's going to be difficult
for the judges to decide.

325
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,060
The judges are conferring.

326
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,198
- It's a tough game, isn't it, Roger?
- It's a blood sport.

327
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,817
Ladies and gentlemen,

328
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:09,697
I'm pleased to announced the winner
of this year's competition.

329
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:13,451
Our new national champion is...

330
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,831
Roger Woodward!

331
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,350
What was he like, Katherine?

332
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,769
Your father.

333
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,858
He was forever busy in his study.

334
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,695
"Go away, Kattie, I'm writing",
he'd always say.

335
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:36,159
One day, I was very young,
I got so annoyed

336
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,079
that I upset the inkpot
all over his desk

337
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:43,416
and scrawled on his work.
Pages of it.

338
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:49,797
When he saw it, he just stood there
seething with anger.

339
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,717
"What are you doing?"

340
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:57,305
There was this terrible silence.

341
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:03,561
I just stared at him and said:
"Go away, Daddy, I'm writing!"

342
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:11,528
He ran at me, picked me up
and cuddled me breathless.

343
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,951
My first literary effort,
he always called it.

344
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:26,709
David, what is it?

345
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,682
Royal College of Music.

346
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,435
A scholarship.

347
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,690
That's marvellous!

348
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:53,194
Daddy won't cuddle me, Katherine.

349
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,948
He can't stop you, David.

350
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:01,327
- He's such an angry lion.
- Nonsense, he's a pussycat.

351
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,166
I'll miss you.

352
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,846
These were for my son,
but you'd better have them.

353
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,641
It gets very cold in London.

354
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,561
Where have you been?

355
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,022
I missed the train.

356
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,066
That Pritchard woman!

357
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,278
What is this? The gloves?

358
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,536
Look at me.

359
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,039
Look at me!

360
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:48,101
And you think you can
just do as you please?

361
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,148
I want to go,
and you can't stop me.

362
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,276
But I am your father!

363
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,613
I have done everything for you!
Everything!

364
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,616
You cruel, callous boy!

365
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,452
- Mum!
- Stupid!

366
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,330
Leave him alone.

367
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,501
Leave him alone!

368
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,962
If you want to go, go!

369
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,132
I'll call the police!

370
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,260
- Go, go!
- Stop it!

371
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,473
Leave him, he's all right.

372
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,435
Are you all right, David?

373
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,106
Are you all right?

374
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:38,943
He's all right.

375
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,697
I'm old enough
to make up my own mind.

376
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,324
He thinks he's going to London.

377
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,786
I've been accepted into
the Royal College of Music.

378
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,372
What will happen to you in London?

379
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,170
David, if you go...

380
00:45:58,213 --> 00:46:00,757
...you'll never come back
into this house again.

381
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,468
You will never be anybody's son.

382
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:07,013
The girls will lose a brother.

383
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,974
Is that what you want?

384
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:14,437
You want to destroy the family?

385
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:16,731
I'm so sorry.

386
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:25,698
If you love me,
you will not step out that door.

387
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:32,163
If you go, you will be punished.

388
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,334
For the rest of your life.

389
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,420
Don't go.

390
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:45,885
I'm sorry.

391
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,894
Don't make me do it!

392
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,504
He has the most fantastic hands.

393
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:06,215
Not connected to his head though.

394
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:11,387
- He's a bit fragile.
- Chopinzee!

395
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:15,308
He can make the finals
in the Concerto trials.

396
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,685
And what have you seen?

397
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,647
- Moments of genius.
- Genius?

398
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,317
Really!

399
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:31,782
Come on, David.

400
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,118
Boldness of attack.

401
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,287
"Diablerie".

402
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,665
- The devil!
- Mustn't break the piano.

403
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:43,002
- Liszt broke plenty of strings.
- Right.

404
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:48,174
Come on!
Fill in for this useless arm!

405
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,677
The notes first, interpretation
comes on top of them.

406
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:57,141
- You agree, do you?
- I always agree.

407
00:48:57,517 --> 00:48:59,352
Is that wise?

408
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:01,604
I don't know. Is it?

409
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,398
Don't forget, it's on the page.

410
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:11,364
The notes are on the page,
but not the feeling.

411
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:14,700
Don't sacrifice everything
to emotion, you need balance.

412
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:19,497
- Is that the question, professor?
- Precisely.

413
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,459
I thought so,
that's what I thought.

414
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:42,144
- Your allowance cheque.
- Thank you.

415
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,438
Sorry, sorry.

416
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:47,858
- I'll stand still.
- Be careful, David.

417
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,612
- You look lovely today, Sarah.
- Thank you.

418
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,282
- You too, Muriel.
- Ease up, Helfgott.

419
00:49:56,451 --> 00:50:00,705
David, you missed the bank.
You'll have to wait until tomorrow.

420
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,875
- Can't bank on the bank.
- We know someone who can cash it.

421
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:04,685
Got to concentrate, Kath.
Got to practice, practice.

422
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:08,856
Professor Parkes says
work, work, work.

423
00:51:09,149 --> 00:51:13,277
That's what I have to do
to win the Concert Medal.

424
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:17,656
The winner gets to play
at the Royal Albert Hall.

425
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:25,664
I bought a beautiful piano.
It's a suffering piano like yours.

426
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:32,254
I wrote to Daddy.
That's positive, isn't it?

427
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,965
He didn't write back, but...

428
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:55,194
How did we manage
to get into the finals?

429
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:58,781
- You're a conductor's nightmare.
- What are we going to do?

430
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:01,450
- We're going to win!
- Right!

431
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,371
Rachmaninov?

432
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,414
Are you sure?

433
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:11,001
I'm never really sure about anything.

434
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,838
The Rach 3.

435
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:15,965
It's monumental!

436
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:19,468
It's a mountain, the hardest
you could everest play.

437
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:23,639
No one's been mad enough
to attempt the Rach 3.

438
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,644
Am I mad enough, professor?

439
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:40,823
Think of two separate melodies
jostling for supremacy.

440
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:47,496
The hands, giants,
ten fingers each.

441
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,961
Performing's a risk.
No safety net.

442
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:57,506
Make no mistake. It's dangerous.

443
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,341
People get hurt.

444
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,137
You have to be able
to play it blindfold.

445
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,018
The page! The notes!

446
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,312
Sorry, I was forgetting them.

447
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:14,356
Is it too much to ask
to learn them first?

448
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:17,109
- And then forget them?
- Precisely.

449
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,570
Just give me the fingering.

450
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,656
David, come on.

451
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:08,994
We'll rest muscles and fingers today
and exercise the imagination.

452
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:12,831
First movement, cadenza.

453
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,542
Let's pick it up from...

454
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:28,264
Your hands must form the unbreakable
habit of playing the notes,

455
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,557
so that you can forget
all about them.

456
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:34,311
Let it come from here. The heart.

457
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,605
That's where it comes from.

458
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:52,955
Don't you love those big fat chords?

459
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:56,709
You have to tame the piano
or it will get away from you.

460
00:54:57,502 --> 00:55:01,171
It's a monster! Tame it,
or it will swallow you whole.

461
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,304
Coming along nicely, David.

462
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,354
'Morning, Mrs Perkins.

463
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,391
I call this my little mausoleum.

464
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:22,354
Liszt... warts and all.

465
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,482
They made this after he was dead.

466
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,820
Poor Franz, dead as a post, eh?

467
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:33,574
You can still get these
on the left bank, quite cheap.

468
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,459
I've got Rachmaninov
in here somewhere.

469
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:52,176
Magnificent fingers. So virile!

470
00:57:56,848 --> 00:58:00,517
I played the Rach 3 for him once.

471
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,436
Really?

472
00:58:03,688 --> 00:58:07,858
He said he could hear himself
in my playing,

473
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:13,572
he said it was as if
I had touched his soul.

474
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,201
Not bad, was it?

475
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,370
Not too bad at all.

476
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,080
Now it's your turn.

477
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:27,419
Remember, once you've done it, nobody
can ever take it away from you.

478
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:33,258
You must play...
as if there was no tomorrow.

479
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,990
Come on, David, don't let me down.

480
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,581
How many moments
of genius today, Cecil?

481
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:22,042
Hello?

482
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,002
Who is this?

483
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:26,880
Hello?

484
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,346
Daddy, I'm home.

485
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,223
Daddy!

486
01:05:39,393 --> 01:05:41,019
Hello? Daddy...

487
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:53,925
Someone here to see you.

488
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:56,928
It's me, Suzie.

489
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:03,935
Suzie. Do we know Suzie?

490
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,645
Your sister.

491
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:09,566
Sister Suzie, sister Suzie.
Thank you, sister nurse.

492
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,450
I won't be able to visit very often.

493
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:21,494
Not so often, sweet Suzie.

494
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:25,206
- I'm going to live in Melbourne.
- Don't tell Daddy.

495
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:29,753
Mustn't cry over spilt milk.
What can you do, Margaret?

496
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:33,214
- Margaret's in Israel, remember?
- I remember Margaret.

497
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:37,385
She called me dopey. Or was it a pig?
It was the poodle.

498
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:41,139
It was all
very complicated in Israel.

499
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:46,061
It was a battleground,
war zone.

500
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:49,189
Such a bore, such a bore,
it was a war.

501
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,775
It just destroys everything.

502
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:22,365
- David!
- That's right!

503
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:27,078
- I knew I'd find you here.
- I've been a naughty boy again.

504
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:29,622
- I think I have.
- Come on.

505
01:09:29,915 --> 01:09:34,043
I might get punished for the rest
of my life because I'm flawed.

506
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:36,087
Silly sausage!

507
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:39,632
It's forbidden fruit,
the doctor says it's forbidden fruit.

508
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:02,947
The thing was he didn't approve,
he didn't approve.

509
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:05,450
He was very disapproving.

510
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:08,953
They'd all scuttle away
and leave me there.

511
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:40,693
So you can read music?

512
01:10:40,945 --> 01:10:45,073
Kind of.
I'm just turning over a new leaf, eh?

513
01:10:45,866 --> 01:10:47,909
My name's Beryl Allcott.
What's yours?

514
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,912
That sounds like my name, Helfgott.

515
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:53,206
- Helfgott?
- Yes. Ridiculous.

516
01:10:53,666 --> 01:10:55,708
It means "with the help of God".

517
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,002
What's your first name?

518
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,296
Yes, first things first.
I'm David.

519
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:07,178
- You're David Helfgott?
- That's right, that's right.

520
01:11:07,429 --> 01:11:09,555
I used to watch you win
all those competitions.

521
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:13,935
- Win some, lose some.
- I was quite a fan.

522
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:20,483
Do you still play?

523
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:25,488
I mustn't, doctor said I mustn't.
It will end in tears if I misbehave.

524
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:29,909
The doctor says it might damage me,
because it did once.

525
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:33,871
A long, long time ago.
That's the story.

526
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:38,042
Come on, you play.
Boldness of attack.

527
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:46,634
That's good, Beryl!
Very good left hand...

528
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,556
You've got to share and care
and just behave, right?

529
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,974
That's right, yes.

530
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:57,437
This is going
to be a stylish marriage!

531
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:01,816
That's very good, Beryl.
Very good.

532
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:08,906
Very good. Press those pedals.
We're riding a bicycle. Pedal!

533
01:12:09,783 --> 01:12:14,412
- What goes on in his head?
- God only knows.

534
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:19,500
- Is it serious?
- It's a complex disorder.

535
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,461
Poor lost soul.

536
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:24,922
He could leave tomorrow
if he had somewhere to go.

537
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:34,098
- Come along, David.
- Beryl, Beryl.

538
01:12:36,226 --> 01:12:39,520
- You know I can't abide smoke.
- Sorry.

539
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:42,273
- What are you doing?
- I'll walk.

540
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:45,610
- You don't know the way.
- I'll follow you.

541
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:50,782
It's all right.
Get in, David!

542
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:55,411
God bless you, David Helfgott!

543
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:57,663
How's this?

544
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:22,063
- Is that you, nurse?
- It's all right, I'm here.

545
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:25,650
I'm here, but where's the nurse?

546
01:13:25,901 --> 01:13:27,318
This is where you live now.

547
01:13:28,987 --> 01:13:31,864
I'm fine, aren't I, Beryl Daisey?

548
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:34,992
This is where David Helfgott
gets back on the rails.

549
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,120
That's the story!

550
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:43,376
That's the story.

551
01:13:57,474 --> 01:14:00,143
Don't you just love
those big fat chords?

552
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:36,095
The botanical garden's
just down the road.

553
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:39,056
You can come and go as you please.

554
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:43,436
Mister Minogue's a lovely man.

555
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:45,521
I know you'll like him.

556
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:49,066
You'll even have your own piano!

557
01:15:32,069 --> 01:15:35,571
Very, very feathery, very light...

558
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,586
Shut up!

559
01:15:55,008 --> 01:15:57,051
Stop it, David!

560
01:15:58,971 --> 01:16:03,766
Good morning, David.
Wakey-wake, it's breakfast time.

561
01:16:05,435 --> 01:16:08,688
We'll give this piano another rest.

562
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,815
Sign your cheque.

563
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:15,403
- Look at you, you should get out.
- Yes, and exercise.

564
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:18,406
Get some fresh air
into those lungs of yours.

565
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:22,785
Yeah, because the weak get crushed
like grasshoppers, don't they?

566
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:56,128
Thank you, thank you.

567
01:17:57,422 --> 01:18:00,508
- I hope you enjoyed it.
- It was great.

568
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,427
Bye.

569
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,319
We're closed.

570
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:14,498
Sylvia, your stray dog's back.

571
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,792
- Shall I get rid of him?
- No.

572
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:23,507
- What about a tune?
- A tune? Sure, no worries.

573
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:32,016
Bravo! Encore!

574
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:36,020
- Sock it to us, Liberace!
- That's enough!

575
01:21:41,938 --> 01:21:45,190
- A hot one, a live one.
- Give us Beethoven's Fifth.

576
01:21:45,483 --> 01:21:47,693
Symphony or Concerto?

577
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:29,068
I played quite well tonight,
didn't I?

578
01:22:29,569 --> 01:22:32,237
I deserve a bit of a snack.

579
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:37,910
Hello, David.

580
01:22:39,871 --> 01:22:41,580
Hello, Daddy.

581
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,168
Are you feeling well?

582
01:22:48,338 --> 01:22:52,633
Well? It's the lid, I can't open the
lid. There's something wrong with it.

583
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:55,135
What could be wrong?

584
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,429
It's a mystery.

585
01:22:58,139 --> 01:22:59,306
Close it.

586
01:23:01,267 --> 01:23:03,477
Give it to me. I'll show you.

587
01:23:24,624 --> 01:23:27,710
You see... how easy it is?

588
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:30,796
Couldn't be easier. That's right.

589
01:23:37,762 --> 01:23:38,929
Here.

590
01:23:49,232 --> 01:23:50,399
Look at me.

591
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:53,318
You are a lucky boy, David.

592
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:58,490
That's true, it seems to be true.
People say that they think I...

593
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:01,285
Get to the point.

594
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:02,995
I'm a very lucky boy.

595
01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:15,966
No one will love you like me.

596
01:24:29,272 --> 01:24:32,441
Do you realize what an opportunity

597
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:34,193
you have here?

598
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,695
Opportunity of a lifetime.

599
01:24:39,699 --> 01:24:40,866
When I was a boy,

600
01:24:44,704 --> 01:24:47,372
I bought a violin.

601
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:49,875
A beautiful violin.

602
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:52,336
I saved

603
01:24:55,131 --> 01:24:56,507
for this violin.

604
01:24:57,217 --> 01:24:59,218
You know

605
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:04,181
what happened to it?

606
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:11,146
No, what happened to it?

607
01:25:11,439 --> 01:25:13,232
I've no idea.

608
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:27,788
You've got to be fit to survive,
to stay alive, haven't you?

609
01:26:00,613 --> 01:26:01,989
Good night, Daddy.

610
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:14,501
- Where are the kids?
- Around somewhere having fun.

611
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:19,506
I've got someone staying on weekends.

612
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:24,136
- But not another Scorpio, is he?
- He's a child prodigy.

613
01:26:32,103 --> 01:26:34,521
- Thanks.
- It's a madhouse!

614
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:50,579
Is that water?

615
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:02,674
Where is he?

616
01:27:20,193 --> 01:27:23,445
Mum!
David's been on for an hour.

617
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:30,619
There's no more hot water, Sylvia.

618
01:27:30,912 --> 01:27:32,788
I want you to meet someone.

619
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:36,041
There's no more hot water. All gone!

620
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,211
Where does it go?

621
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:41,213
Gillian's a dear friend of mine.

622
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:43,548
A friendly doctor.
I feel better already.

623
01:27:43,841 --> 01:27:48,470
- Not a doctor, she's an astrologer.
- A specialist, a heart surgeon!

624
01:27:48,721 --> 01:27:52,933
An open heart surgeon!
Oh, I'm ridiculous, aren't I?

625
01:27:53,184 --> 01:27:56,019
- Gillian might do your chart.
- Would she?

626
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:58,355
- Would she do my chart?
- Of course.

627
01:27:58,648 --> 01:28:01,066
- What sort of chart?
- An astrological chart.

628
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:04,027
- The stars! I love the stars!
- And the planets.

629
01:28:04,237 --> 01:28:07,322
The planets, of course.
Mercury and Neptune...

630
01:28:07,573 --> 01:28:11,368
oh, the music of the spheres.
If music be the food of love...

631
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:13,370
The food of love!

632
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:17,416
What's it like
when he gets to know you better?

633
01:29:11,554 --> 01:29:15,682
- What does he do?
- He's an investment advisor.

634
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:18,769
How serious is it?

635
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,272
Come on, Gillian.
On a scale of 1 to 10.

636
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:25,817
I'll take that as 10!

637
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:31,448
- When's the happy day?
- I hate to rush into things.

638
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:38,038
I won't kiss you.

639
01:29:43,294 --> 01:29:46,963
Lovely, gorgeous hair.
Blondes have more fun, don't they?

640
01:29:48,341 --> 01:29:51,093
There you are, doctor.

641
01:29:51,344 --> 01:29:52,886
That's sparkly!

642
01:29:53,137 --> 01:29:55,806
Got to go to my room.

643
01:30:19,622 --> 01:30:22,874
- Mind if I come in?
- Hello, doctor. Entree.

644
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:25,377
Where will I put these? Oh, sorry.

645
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:29,256
It's not your fault.
It just seems to be getting bigger.

646
01:30:29,465 --> 01:30:32,551
Amazing what you find when
you're not looking. There he is.

647
01:30:32,718 --> 01:30:34,719
- Who?
- Roger.

648
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:39,141
- Roger Woodward!
- Yeah! He's a winner. He's a winner.

649
01:30:40,643 --> 01:30:43,103
- You've got one going already.
- He's a big hit.

650
01:30:43,354 --> 01:30:46,273
- The cigarette.
- One's enough.

651
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:50,527
- I really loved your playing.
- Did you?

652
01:30:51,654 --> 01:30:54,739
- Do you write music as well?
- No, that's the Rach 3.

653
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:58,618
- It started out as a letter.
- I think it was.

654
01:30:58,953 --> 01:31:02,914
- "Dear Professor Cecil, Royal..."
- Royal College of Music.

655
01:31:03,207 --> 01:31:04,833
- It's a mystery.
- What is?

656
01:31:05,084 --> 01:31:08,170
He only had one arm, you see.
It was a stroke.

657
01:31:08,421 --> 01:31:10,630
Yeah, poor pussycat.

658
01:31:10,923 --> 01:31:14,426
His paw was damaged beyond repair,
he couldn't do a thing with it.

659
01:31:14,677 --> 01:31:18,805
He was a sad pussycat.
And it was just bad luck.

660
01:31:19,056 --> 01:31:21,641
- I'm not damaging you, am I?
- No.

661
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:25,020
What's the matter?

662
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:28,690
Oh, the matter? It started out
being... but it's a blank.

663
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:32,527
It was all such a long time ago.
That's the story.

664
01:31:32,820 --> 01:31:34,779
Inexpressible.

665
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:38,492
- To express the inexplicable.
- Tell me what you want to say.

666
01:31:38,784 --> 01:31:41,203
That's a hard one.

667
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:44,331
It's not. Look... D.E.A.R.

668
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:47,542
- That's it.
- Dear Cecil.

669
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:49,878
Parkes! Cecil was Parkes.

670
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:54,174
He touched the soul of Sergei
Vasilievitcjh himself with Rach 3.

671
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:55,926
It's a hard piece.

672
01:31:56,177 --> 01:32:01,097
"Dear Mr Parkes,
it has been such a long time

673
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:03,391
and I...

674
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:06,353
And I hope...
How does that sound?

675
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:07,979
Pretty good.

676
01:32:08,272 --> 01:32:10,315
I hope you remember me
and the Rach 3.

677
01:32:10,775 --> 01:32:15,904
I'm feeling better now
and I've started playing again.

678
01:32:45,059 --> 01:32:46,685
Well done, Roger!

679
01:32:51,607 --> 01:32:52,983
That was good!

680
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:20,468
Smile, David.

681
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:23,179
- I am, Sylvia.
- At the camera.

682
01:33:25,224 --> 01:33:27,225
- Time to go.
- What can you do?

683
01:33:27,518 --> 01:33:31,980
- You'll see her again one day.
- Life goes on.

684
01:33:32,189 --> 01:33:34,316
- It does.
- Of course, it does.

685
01:33:34,525 --> 01:33:37,611
- She has to go.
- Yes, wrigglies to look after.

686
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:40,947
No, my kids are all grown up.
It's just little old me.

687
01:33:41,157 --> 01:33:44,784
It's just me too.
I never grew up, I grew down.

688
01:33:45,077 --> 01:33:47,579
A bit of a handful, aren't I?

689
01:33:52,543 --> 01:33:53,918
Will you marry me?

690
01:33:58,090 --> 01:34:00,133
It wouldn't be very practical.

691
01:34:00,426 --> 01:34:04,638
Of course not, but neither
am I, I'm not practical at all.

692
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:06,473
You'll miss the plane.

693
01:34:06,932 --> 01:34:08,475
It's sweet of you.

694
01:34:09,644 --> 01:34:13,104
- I don't know what to say.
- Ask the stars, darling.

695
01:35:48,784 --> 01:35:50,827
You'd better let her breathe, David.

696
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:01,880
I won't kiss you.

697
01:36:25,821 --> 01:36:28,490
Sorry, darling.

698
01:36:30,826 --> 01:36:33,036
You made a noise.

699
01:36:52,932 --> 01:36:55,350
Oh no, poor Ravel!

700
01:36:55,643 --> 01:36:58,728
Poor Maurice, all unravelled.

701
01:36:58,979 --> 01:37:00,605
It's nearly time to get ready.

702
01:37:00,856 --> 01:37:03,942
- Can I swim some more?
- All right, ten minutes.

703
01:37:04,193 --> 01:37:07,862
Do some Liszt.
Swim "la Campanella".

704
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:09,781
That should do it.

705
01:37:14,829 --> 01:37:17,038
- I've gone wrong.
- Keep trying.

706
01:37:17,331 --> 01:37:20,416
- I'm trying.
- Page 37's missing.

707
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:23,920
It's the coda,
the beginning of the end.

708
01:37:24,421 --> 01:37:26,422
I'll soak my hands.

709
01:37:33,389 --> 01:37:34,597
Gotcha!

710
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:43,940
The first concert in years
and you wear odd shoes!

711
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:46,651
Sit! No, up straight!

712
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:51,698
- Relax!
- Relax! Must learn to relax!

713
01:37:53,826 --> 01:37:55,451
Perfect.

714
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:01,100
They want an encore.

715
01:39:01,393 --> 01:39:04,479
- They want some more?
- What are you going to do?

716
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:07,065
- I'm going to win.
- Not now, darling.

717
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:09,067
I'll do some more.

718
01:40:09,461 --> 01:40:10,712
What do you feel?

719
01:40:11,463 --> 01:40:12,922
I feel nothing.

720
01:40:14,383 --> 01:40:15,550
Nothing at all?

721
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:19,345
I'm shocked, stunned and amazed.
How does that sound?

722
01:40:20,222 --> 01:40:22,432
Perhaps it's all my fault.

723
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:25,560
You can't go on blaming yourself.

724
01:40:25,853 --> 01:40:29,522
And you can't go on blaming Daddy
because he's not here any more.

725
01:40:29,815 --> 01:40:32,650
- But you are.
- I am. That's true!

726
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:36,612
Life goes on, Gillian, is that right?
It does. For ever and ever.

727
01:40:36,905 --> 01:40:38,072
Not forever.

728
01:40:38,365 --> 01:40:40,867
No, not forever. Not quite.

729
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:44,954
Life's not all lamb loin chops,
but it goes on.

730
01:40:45,247 --> 01:40:49,959
- You can't give up.
- Saturn will give us a jolt.

731
01:40:50,252 --> 01:40:53,838
- It's the stars!
- Everything has its season.

732
01:40:53,964 --> 01:40:56,215
- It's a mystery.
- There's always a reason.

733
01:40:56,508 --> 01:40:59,177
We just need to seize
the reason for the season.
