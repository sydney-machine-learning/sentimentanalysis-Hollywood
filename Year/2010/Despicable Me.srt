1
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:38,433
Excuse me, sir,
is there a commode?

2
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,110
Justin!

3
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:52,238
Quick, honey, take my picture.
I got the pyramid in my hand.

4
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:03,541
Justin, you get back here
right now!

5
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:05,001
No, stop!

6
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,504
- No, no! Stop him!
- Go back! Don't climb!

7
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:13,301
Wait, wait.

8
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,428
Hold on. Easy, little boy.

9
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:19,057
Okay, stop, child!
Stop right there. No!

10
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,311
No, no, no! There he goes.

11
00:02:34,864 --> 00:02:36,032
Justin!

12
00:02:44,707 --> 00:02:46,501
I've got him! I've got him!

13
00:02:57,428 --> 00:02:59,889
Outrage in Egypt tonight
as it was discovered

14
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:02,725
that the Great Pyramid of Giza
had been stolen

15
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:05,645
and replaced
by a giant inflatable replica.

16
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:08,898
There is panic throughout the globe
as countries and citizens

17
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:12,068
try to protect
their beloved landmarks.

18
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,154
Law enforcement
still has no leads,

19
00:03:15,238 --> 00:03:17,615
leaving everyone to wonder,
which of the world's villains

20
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:20,243
is responsible
for this heinous crime?

21
00:03:20,535 --> 00:03:22,328
And where will he strike next?

22
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:13,671
I'm having a bad, bad day

23
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:16,799
It's about time
that I get my way

24
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:19,469
Steamrolling whatever I see

25
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:22,805
Freeze ray!
Freeze ray! Freeze ray!

26
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:25,016
I'm having a bad, bad day

27
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:28,144
If you take it personal,
that's okay

28
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:30,813
Watch, this is so fun to see

29
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,525
Despicable me

30
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:00,552
Morning, Gru!

31
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:03,054
How you doing?

32
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,139
Hello, Fred.

33
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:10,270
FYI, your dog has been leaving
little bombs all over my yard,

34
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:12,438
and I don't appreciate it.

35
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:16,150
Sorry. You know dogs.
They go wherever they want to go.

36
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,986
Unless they're dead.

37
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,698
I'm joking!

38
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:25,702
Although, it is true.
Anyway, have a good one.

39
00:05:26,578 --> 00:05:29,205
Okay. Yeah.

40
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,209
Steamrolling whatever I see

41
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:35,545
Despicable me

42
00:05:36,004 --> 00:05:38,423
I'm having a bad, bad day

43
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:41,134
If you take it personal,
that's okay

44
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,140
Despicable me

45
00:05:53,062 --> 00:05:55,690
You've got to be pulling on my leg!

46
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:00,570
Hello!

47
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:03,489
Cookies for sale.

48
00:06:05,617 --> 00:06:07,827
Go away. I'm not home.

49
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:10,663
Yes, you are. I heard you.

50
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:14,584
No, you didn't. This

51
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:16,586
is a recording.

52
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,922
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

53
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:23,593
Watch this. Leave a message, beep.

54
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:29,182
Goodbye, recorded message.

55
00:06:29,265 --> 00:06:31,100
Agnes, come on.

56
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:42,904
Kyle!

57
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:46,950
Bad dog! No! No, no.
Sit. My muffin.

58
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:48,159
Gru!

59
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,787
Dr Nefario.

60
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:52,539
I know how you must be feeling.

61
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:56,084
I, too, have encountered
great disappointment,

62
00:06:56,751 --> 00:07:00,588
but in my eyes,
you will always be one of the greats.

63
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:02,715
What? What happened?

64
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:04,217
It's all over the news!

65
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,302
Some fella just stole a pyramid.

66
00:07:06,386 --> 00:07:09,639
They're saying he makes
all other villains look

67
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:11,975
lame.

68
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,354
Assemble the minions!

69
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,845
Minions, assemble!

70
00:07:49,888 --> 00:07:51,347
Okay. Okay.

71
00:07:58,396 --> 00:07:59,522
Hey!

72
00:08:46,945 --> 00:08:49,614
Looking good, Kevin!
How is the family? Good?

73
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:50,907
All right.

74
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,993
That's my Billy boy!
What up, Larry?

75
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:57,080
Hello, everybody!

76
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:59,040
Yeah, all right!

77
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:01,459
Simmer down. Simmer down!

78
00:09:01,543 --> 00:09:03,419
Thank you, okay.

79
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:06,422
Now, I realize that you guys
probably heard

80
00:09:06,506 --> 00:09:09,259
about this other villain
who stole the pyramids.

81
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:11,678
Apparently, it's a big deal.

82
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:15,181
People are calling it the crime
of the century and stuff like that.

83
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:19,435
But am I upset? No, I am not!

84
00:09:20,937 --> 00:09:22,355
A little,

85
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:26,359
but we have had
a pretty good year ourselves,

86
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:29,362
and you guys
are all right in my book.

87
00:09:30,446 --> 00:09:31,698
No, no raises!

88
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:34,951
You're not going to get
any raises.

89
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:37,453
What did we do?

90
00:09:37,537 --> 00:09:43,543
Well, we stole
the Times Square JumboTron!

91
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:45,253
Nice!

92
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:48,965
That's how I roll.

93
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,052
Yeah, you all like watching football
on that, huh?

94
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:55,263
But that's not all.

95
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:58,641
We stole the Statue of Liberty,

96
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:02,729
the small one from Las Vegas.

97
00:10:04,898 --> 00:10:08,902
And I won't even mention
the Eiffel Tower! Also Vegas.

98
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:11,779
Okay, I wasn't going to tell you
about this yet,

99
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:16,534
but I have been working
on something very big!

100
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:21,831
Something that will blow this
pyramid thing out of the water!

101
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:26,794
And thanks to the efforts
of my good friend Dr Nefario...

102
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,630
Thank you!

103
00:10:28,713 --> 00:10:30,006
There he is.

104
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:31,549
He's styling.

105
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:35,512
Now, we have located a shrink ray

106
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:40,225
in a secret lab,
and once we take this shrink ray,

107
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:43,728
we will have the capability

108
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:47,774
to pull off the true crime
of the century.

109
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:50,985
We are going to steal...

110
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,909
Wait, wait!
I haven't told you what it is yet.

111
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:02,330
Hey.

112
00:11:02,413 --> 00:11:04,541
Dave, listen up, please.

113
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,590
Next, we are going to steal,

114
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:15,009
pause for effect,

115
00:11:15,802 --> 00:11:17,971
the moon!

116
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,017
And once the moon is mine,

117
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:27,814
the world will give me
whatever I want to get it back!

118
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:33,236
And I will be the greatest villain
of all time!

119
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:40,451
That's what I'm talking about.

120
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:43,163
Yes?

121
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:47,000
Hello, Gru?
I've been crunching some numbers,

122
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,253
and I really don't see
how we can afford this.

123
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:53,131
It can't be done.
I'm not a miracle worker.

124
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,216
Hey, chillax.

125
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,928
I'll just get another loan
from the bank. They love me!

126
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:16,321
Edith, stop it!

127
00:12:16,404 --> 00:12:18,489
What? I'm just walking.

128
00:12:31,294 --> 00:12:33,421
- Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.
- Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.

129
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:37,800
Hello, girls!

130
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:40,720
Anybody come to adopt us
while we were out?

131
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:43,640
Let me think.

132
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,225
No!

133
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:51,523
Edith!
What did you put on my desk?

134
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,608
A mud pie.

135
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:58,279
You're never gonna get adopted, Edith.
You know that, don't you?

136
00:12:58,363 --> 00:13:00,657
- Yeah, I know.
- Good.

137
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,327
So, how did it go, girls?
Did we meet our quotas?

138
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:06,496
Sort of.

139
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:08,373
We sold 43 mini-mints,

140
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:10,834
30 choco-swirlies,
and 18 coco-nutties.

141
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,921
Okay.

142
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:19,175
Well, you say that
like it's a great sale day.

143
00:13:19,259 --> 00:13:21,427
Look at my face!

144
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:24,764
Do you still think
it's a great sale day?

145
00:13:25,682 --> 00:13:27,684
Eighteen coco-nutties.

146
00:13:28,101 --> 00:13:32,772
I think we can do a little better
than that, don't you?

147
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:34,649
Yeah.

148
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:39,112
We wouldn't want to spend the weekend
in the Box of Shame, would we? No.

149
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:40,697
- No, Miss Hattie.
- No, Miss Hattie.

150
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,492
Okay, good. Off you go.
Go clean something of mine.

151
00:13:46,536 --> 00:13:47,787
- Hi, Penny.
- Hi, Penny.

152
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:49,038
Hi, guys.

153
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:57,213
Hello, Mom.
Sorry, I meant to call, but...

154
00:13:57,547 --> 00:14:00,842
I just wanted to congratulate you
on stealing the pyramid.

155
00:14:01,885 --> 00:14:03,303
That was you, wasn't it?

156
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:07,182
Or was it a villain
who's actually successful?

157
00:14:08,308 --> 00:14:11,060
Just so you know, Mom,
I am about to do something

158
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:13,897
that's very, very big,
very important.

159
00:14:14,272 --> 00:14:17,066
When you hear about it,
you're going to be very proud.

160
00:14:18,568 --> 00:14:21,779
Good luck with that.
Okay, I'm out of here.

161
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:32,225
Gru to see Mr. Perkins.

162
00:15:32,642 --> 00:15:34,727
Yes, please have a seat.

163
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:48,700
That's one small step for man,

164
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,329
one giant leap for mankind.

165
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:56,207
Ma, someday
I'm going to go to the moon.

166
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,169
I'm afraid you're too late, Son.

167
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:01,963
NASA isn't sending
the monkeys any more.

168
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,764
Hey.

169
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:23,359
I'm applying for a new villain loan.
Go by the name of Vector.

170
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:29,490
It's a mathematical term,

171
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:34,078
a quantity represented by an arrow,
with both direction and magnitude.

172
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:40,084
Vector! That's me,

173
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:45,423
'cause I'm committing crimes
with both direction and magnitude.

174
00:16:45,507 --> 00:16:47,175
Oh, yeah!

175
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:50,929
Check out my new weapon.

176
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:53,264
Piranha gun! Oh, yes!

177
00:16:53,348 --> 00:16:55,517
Fires live piranhas.
Ever seen one before?

178
00:16:55,517 --> 00:16:57,101
No, you haven't.
I invented it.

179
00:16:57,185 --> 00:16:59,354
Do you want a demonstration?

180
00:17:00,313 --> 00:17:04,567
Shoot! So difficult, sometimes,
to get the piranha back inside of my...

181
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:07,111
Mr. Gru, Mr. Perkins will see you now.

182
00:17:08,112 --> 00:17:09,322
So, all I need

183
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:12,450
is money from the bank
to build a rocket.

184
00:17:12,534 --> 00:17:15,495
- And then, the moon is ours.
- Wow!

185
00:17:16,371 --> 00:17:18,248
Well, very nice presentation.

186
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:20,625
I'd like to see this shrink ray.

187
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:24,796
Absolutely! Will do.
Soon as I have it.

188
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,841
You don't have it?

189
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:31,594
And yet you have the audacity
to ask the bank for money?

190
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:34,180
Apparently.

191
00:17:34,264 --> 00:17:36,266
Do you have any idea

192
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:39,644
of the capital that this bank
has invested in you, Gru?

193
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:44,274
With far too few of your sinister plots
actually turning a profit.

194
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:48,945
How can I put it?
Let's say this apple is you.

195
00:17:49,487 --> 00:17:51,990
If we don't start getting
our money back...

196
00:17:53,825 --> 00:17:55,535
Get the picture?

197
00:17:56,953 --> 00:18:00,540
Look, Gru, the point is, there are
a lot of new villains out there,

198
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:03,668
younger than you,
hungrier than you,

199
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:05,795
younger than you.

200
00:18:05,879 --> 00:18:08,173
Like that young fellow out there
named Vector.

201
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:09,841
He just stole a pyramid!

202
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:16,472
I've got it. I've got it.

203
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:20,476
So, as far as getting money
for the rocket...

204
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,563
Get the shrink ray,
then we'll talk.

205
00:19:53,361 --> 00:19:54,612
Suckers!

206
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:00,994
Suckers!

207
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:09,210
We got it!

208
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:17,385
What?

209
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:20,263
Hey! Hey! What! Hey!

210
00:20:21,973 --> 00:20:23,016
No, no, no!

211
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:27,729
You!

212
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:34,485
Now, maybe you'll think twice
before you freeze someone's head!

213
00:20:34,569 --> 00:20:36,362
So long, Gru!

214
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:40,366
Quick! We can't let him get away!

215
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:49,876
Up ahead! Up ahead!

216
00:20:50,752 --> 00:20:52,712
Fire! Fire, now!

217
00:21:01,346 --> 00:21:02,388
You missed me!

218
00:21:02,472 --> 00:21:04,516
Come to papa!

219
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:19,072
Take that.

220
00:21:21,074 --> 00:21:22,742
How adorable.

221
00:21:23,993 --> 00:21:25,537
Got you in our sights!

222
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,581
Like taking candy from a...

223
00:21:28,665 --> 00:21:29,749
What?

224
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:32,752
Hey, Gru!

225
00:21:32,836 --> 00:21:35,964
Try this on for size!

226
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:40,134
That's weird. What is going...

227
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:47,100
This is claustrophobic!

228
00:21:48,476 --> 00:21:49,894
No, no, no!

229
00:21:55,733 --> 00:21:58,152
Too small!
This is too small for me!

230
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:06,286
I hate that guy!

231
00:22:13,084 --> 00:22:17,130
...and please watch over us, and bless
that we'll have a good night's sleep.

232
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:21,259
And bless that while we're sleeping,
no bugs will crawl into our ears

233
00:22:21,342 --> 00:22:23,595
and lay eggs in our brains.

234
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:26,598
Great.
Thanks for that image, Edith.

235
00:22:27,223 --> 00:22:29,976
And please bless
that someone will adopt us soon,

236
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:32,979
and that the mommy and daddy
will be nice

237
00:22:33,062 --> 00:22:34,981
and have a pet unicorn.

238
00:22:35,398 --> 00:22:36,608
Amen.

239
00:22:36,691 --> 00:22:38,443
- Amen.
- Amen.

240
00:22:43,281 --> 00:22:46,618
Unicorns, I love them
Unicorns, I love them

241
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:50,413
Uni, uni, unicorns
I love them

242
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,125
Uni, unicorns,
I could pet one

243
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:56,586
If they were really real

244
00:22:56,669 --> 00:22:57,795
And they are

245
00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:00,423
So, I bought one
so I could pet it

246
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,718
Now it loves me
Now I love it

247
00:24:20,503 --> 00:24:22,881
Don't you... What the...

248
00:24:52,744 --> 00:24:54,579
Good luck, little girls!

249
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:01,961
Whoa! Cool.

250
00:25:03,046 --> 00:25:07,091
Hi! We're orphans
from Miss Hattie's Home for Girls.

251
00:25:07,175 --> 00:25:09,093
- I don't care. Beat it!
- Come on!

252
00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:12,472
We're selling cookies so,
you know, we can have a better future.

253
00:25:12,555 --> 00:25:15,391
- Wait, wait!
Do you have coco-nutties? - Yeah.

254
00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:39,666
Light bulb.

255
00:25:42,752 --> 00:25:44,087
Dr Nefario!

256
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:47,423
I'm going to need a dozen tiny robots
disguised as cookies!

257
00:25:47,507 --> 00:25:49,467
- What?
- Cookie robots!

258
00:25:49,551 --> 00:25:51,970
- Who is this?
- Oh, forget it.

259
00:25:58,601 --> 00:26:01,396
Well, it appears you have cleared
our background check,

260
00:26:01,938 --> 00:26:03,690
Dr Gru.

261
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,112
And I see you have made a list

262
00:26:09,195 --> 00:26:12,949
of some of your personal achievements.

263
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:15,827
Thank you for that.
I love reading.

264
00:26:23,626 --> 00:26:26,087
And I see you have been given
the Medal of Honor

265
00:26:26,171 --> 00:26:28,298
and a knighthood.

266
00:26:30,675 --> 00:26:32,177
- Me, me, me.
- Me, me, me.

267
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,511
Kevin?

268
00:26:35,221 --> 00:26:37,348
You had your own cooking show

269
00:26:37,432 --> 00:26:41,352
and you can hold your breath
for 30 seconds?

270
00:26:41,436 --> 00:26:43,146
It's not that impressive.

271
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:46,608
Idiot!

272
00:26:48,651 --> 00:26:51,446
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

273
00:26:53,364 --> 00:26:56,367
What in the name of... What?

274
00:26:56,951 --> 00:27:00,163
Well, here's the dealio.

275
00:27:00,246 --> 00:27:05,168
Things have been
so lonely since my wife,

276
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:09,547
Debbie, passed on.

277
00:27:09,631 --> 00:27:12,717
It's like my heart is a tooth,

278
00:27:13,384 --> 00:27:18,264
and it's got a cavity
that can only be filled with children.

279
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:19,849
I'm sorry.

280
00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:27,398
You are a beautiful woman.
Do you speak Spanish?

281
00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:30,318
Do I look like I speak Spanish?

282
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:35,740
You have a face como un burro.

283
00:27:39,244 --> 00:27:41,746
Well, thank you!

284
00:27:43,248 --> 00:27:46,960
Anyway, can we proceed
with this adoption?

285
00:27:47,043 --> 00:27:48,628
So, so excited!

286
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:53,925
Please tell Margo, Edith and Agnes
to come to the lobby.

287
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,680
I bet the mom is beautiful!

288
00:27:58,763 --> 00:28:00,890
I bet the daddy's eyes sparkle.

289
00:28:00,974 --> 00:28:03,768
I bet their house
is made of Gummi Bears.

290
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:07,063
I'm just saying it'd be nice.

291
00:28:08,147 --> 00:28:11,442
My caterpillar
never turned into a butterfly.

292
00:28:11,526 --> 00:28:13,152
That's a Cheeto.

293
00:28:16,281 --> 00:28:19,784
Well, Debbie was a very lucky woman.

294
00:28:22,203 --> 00:28:23,621
Who's Debbie?

295
00:28:23,705 --> 00:28:25,123
Your wife.

296
00:28:25,582 --> 00:28:27,083
Hi, girls!

297
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:39,929
Girls, I want you to meet Mr. Gru.

298
00:28:41,306 --> 00:28:43,349
He's going to adopt you.

299
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:45,977
And he's a dentist!

300
00:28:48,313 --> 00:28:49,647
Yeah!

301
00:28:53,401 --> 00:28:57,780
Hi. I'm Margo. This is Edith.

302
00:28:58,323 --> 00:29:00,158
And that's Agnes.

303
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:02,202
I got your leg, I got your leg!

304
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:05,371
Okay, that is enough, little girl.

305
00:29:05,455 --> 00:29:07,790
- Let go of my leg. Come on.
You can do it. - Higher!

306
00:29:07,874 --> 00:29:10,168
- Higher!
- Just release your grip. Wow!

307
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,630
How do you remove them?
Is there a command?

308
00:29:13,713 --> 00:29:15,673
Some nonstick spray?

309
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,843
Crowbar?

310
00:29:20,637 --> 00:29:23,306
Okay, girls, let's go.

311
00:29:47,163 --> 00:29:48,581
Oh, yeah!

312
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,961
Pretty impressive!

313
00:29:54,254 --> 00:29:56,214
What are you looking at?

314
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:57,549
Boo-ya!

315
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,761
You got shrunk, tiny mouthwash!

316
00:30:02,387 --> 00:30:03,429
Take that!

317
00:30:04,556 --> 00:30:06,349
You done been shrunk!

318
00:30:07,183 --> 00:30:08,393
Yello?

319
00:30:09,227 --> 00:30:11,229
I got the shrink ray, all right.

320
00:30:12,438 --> 00:30:14,941
No, I'm not playing with it.

321
00:30:15,024 --> 00:30:16,526
Gru?

322
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,155
Don't make me laugh! No.

323
00:30:20,655 --> 00:30:23,199
P.S., he is not getting the moon,

324
00:30:23,283 --> 00:30:26,327
and P.P.S., by the time
I'm done with him,

325
00:30:26,411 --> 00:30:27,954
he's gonna be begging for mercy.

326
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,249
Okay, bye.

327
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:37,338
Look at you, a little tiny toilet
for a little tiny baby...

328
00:30:38,756 --> 00:30:40,592
Curse you, tiny toilet!

329
00:30:45,263 --> 00:30:47,348
Okay, here we are.

330
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:48,975
Home sweet home.

331
00:30:51,436 --> 00:30:54,355
So, this is, like, your house?

332
00:30:55,148 --> 00:30:56,441
Wait a sec...

333
00:30:56,524 --> 00:30:59,277
You're the guy who pretended
he was a recorded message!

334
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,362
No, that was someone else.

335
00:31:14,918 --> 00:31:16,211
Can I hold your hand?

336
00:31:17,003 --> 00:31:18,046
No.

337
00:31:28,306 --> 00:31:33,186
When we got adopted by a bald guy,
I thought this'd be more like Annie.

338
00:31:42,111 --> 00:31:43,404
No, hey!

339
00:31:47,492 --> 00:31:50,662
Kyle, these are not treats.
These are guests.

340
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:53,373
Girls, this is Kyle, my

341
00:31:53,456 --> 00:31:54,499
dog.

342
00:31:57,335 --> 00:31:58,419
Fluffy doggy!

343
00:32:03,842 --> 00:32:05,009
What kind of dog is that?

344
00:32:05,093 --> 00:32:07,720
He is a... I don't know.

345
00:32:08,596 --> 00:32:11,808
Do you really think that this is
an appropriate place for little kids?

346
00:32:12,308 --> 00:32:13,977
'Cause it's not.

347
00:32:15,019 --> 00:32:17,397
No! No! Stay away from there!

348
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,023
It's fragile.

349
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:25,071
Well, I suppose
the plan will work with two.

350
00:32:25,155 --> 00:32:27,949
Hey! It's dark in here.

351
00:32:30,827 --> 00:32:33,163
It poked a hole in my juice box.

352
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:39,377
As you can see,

353
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,964
I have provided everything
a child might need.

354
00:32:44,841 --> 00:32:45,925
All right.

355
00:32:47,051 --> 00:32:49,429
Okay. As I was saying... Hey!

356
00:32:50,638 --> 00:32:51,681
Somebody broke that.

357
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,810
Okay, okay.
Clearly, we need to set some rules.

358
00:32:55,894 --> 00:32:57,729
Rule number one.

359
00:32:57,812 --> 00:33:00,398
You will not touch anything.

360
00:33:00,481 --> 00:33:02,317
What about the floor?

361
00:33:02,734 --> 00:33:04,777
Yes, you may touch the floor.

362
00:33:04,861 --> 00:33:06,237
What about the air?

363
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:08,406
Yes, you may touch the air!

364
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,532
What about this?

365
00:33:12,702 --> 00:33:14,662
- Where did you get that?
- Found it.

366
00:33:14,746 --> 00:33:18,541
Okay. Rule number two. You will not
bother me while I'm working.

367
00:33:18,625 --> 00:33:20,502
Rule number three.

368
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:25,048
You will not cry or whine
or laugh or giggle

369
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:27,759
or sneeze or burp or fart!

370
00:33:28,426 --> 00:33:32,764
So, no, no, no annoying sounds.
All right?

371
00:33:32,847 --> 00:33:35,099
Does this count as annoying?

372
00:33:38,436 --> 00:33:39,812
Very!

373
00:33:42,106 --> 00:33:44,692
I will see you in six hours.

374
00:33:46,778 --> 00:33:50,698
Okay, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

375
00:33:51,324 --> 00:33:55,703
We're gonna be really happy here.
Right? Agnes?

376
00:34:24,274 --> 00:34:27,277
Question. What are these?

377
00:34:28,194 --> 00:34:31,239
A dozen boogie robots! Boogie!

378
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,784
Look at this. Watch me!

379
00:34:38,663 --> 00:34:41,332
Cookie robots.
I said cookie robots.

380
00:34:41,916 --> 00:34:44,502
Why are you so old?

381
00:34:46,963 --> 00:34:48,673
Okay. I'm on it.

382
00:34:49,507 --> 00:34:50,842
Hello?

383
00:35:06,524 --> 00:35:07,775
TV!

384
00:35:27,629 --> 00:35:28,838
What is that?

385
00:35:29,047 --> 00:35:31,466
- Look at that!
- That is cool!

386
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,593
Come on!

387
00:35:34,093 --> 00:35:36,387
I don't think he's a dentist.

388
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:52,070
We've been working on this
for a while.

389
00:35:52,153 --> 00:35:54,906
It's a anti-gravity serum.

390
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:04,040
I meant to close that.
He'll be all right, I'm sure.

391
00:36:04,123 --> 00:36:07,168
- Do the effects wear off?
- So far,

392
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:09,254
no. No, they don't.

393
00:36:10,797 --> 00:36:13,883
And here, of course,
is the new weapon you ordered.

394
00:36:17,554 --> 00:36:18,596
No, no.

395
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,517
I said "dart gun", not... Okay.

396
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:25,854
Oh, yes. 'Cause I was wondering

397
00:36:25,937 --> 00:36:28,565
under what circumstances
would we use this?

398
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:30,108
But, anyway.

399
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:33,611
What I really wanted to show you
was this.

400
00:36:38,366 --> 00:36:41,494
Now those are cookie robots!

401
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,874
La, la, la, la
I love unicorns

402
00:36:45,957 --> 00:36:49,627
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay in the kitchen!

403
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:52,380
We got bored.
What is this place?

404
00:36:52,463 --> 00:36:54,215
Can I drink this?

405
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:56,759
Do you want to explode?

406
00:36:58,386 --> 00:36:59,429
Gru!

407
00:36:59,512 --> 00:37:01,472
Get back in the kitchen!

408
00:37:01,556 --> 00:37:03,683
- Will you play with us?
- No.

409
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,311
- Why?
- Because I'm busy.

410
00:37:06,394 --> 00:37:07,979
Doing what?

411
00:37:09,397 --> 00:37:10,982
Okay, okay, you got me.

412
00:37:11,065 --> 00:37:13,818
The dentist thing
is more of a hobby.

413
00:37:14,402 --> 00:37:16,821
In real life, I am a spy.

414
00:37:17,322 --> 00:37:20,492
And it is top secret,
and you may not tell anybody,

415
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:22,660
- because if you do...
- What does this do?

416
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:27,665
Hey!

417
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,959
My unicorn!

418
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:31,961
You have to fix it.

419
00:37:32,045 --> 00:37:35,256
Fix it? Look,
it has been disintegrated.

420
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:37,342
By definition, it cannot be fixed.

421
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:44,807
That's freaking me out.
What is she doing?

422
00:37:44,891 --> 00:37:48,061
She's gonna hold her breath
until she gets a new one.

423
00:37:49,437 --> 00:37:52,815
It is just a toy. Now stop it!

424
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:57,237
Okay, okay! I'll fix it!

425
00:37:57,654 --> 00:37:59,614
Tim! Mark! Phil!

426
00:38:02,283 --> 00:38:03,535
This is very important.

427
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:07,121
You have to get the little girl
a new unicorn toy.

428
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:15,046
Hey, hey, hey! A toy!

429
00:38:16,214 --> 00:38:18,341
Go, and hurry!

430
00:38:18,424 --> 00:38:19,592
What are those?

431
00:38:19,676 --> 00:38:22,846
They are my cousins.

432
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,223
Jerry! Stuart!

433
00:38:26,307 --> 00:38:29,310
Watch them, and keep them
away from me, please.

434
00:38:46,578 --> 00:38:48,955
- Wow!
- Wow!

435
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,188
It was your cousin's idea.

436
00:39:55,522 --> 00:39:56,689
What?

437
00:39:57,065 --> 00:39:58,566
Okay, bedtime.

438
00:40:01,861 --> 00:40:03,321
Not you two!

439
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:09,577
Okey-dokey. Beddie-bye.
All tucked in. Sweet dreams.

440
00:40:11,496 --> 00:40:13,331
Just so you know,

441
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:15,375
you're never gonna be my dad.

442
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:18,044
I think I can live with that.

443
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,548
Are these beds
made out of bombs?

444
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:26,261
Yes, but they are very old
and highly unlikely to blow up.

445
00:40:27,178 --> 00:40:29,222
But try not to toss and turn.

446
00:40:29,305 --> 00:40:30,431
Cool.

447
00:40:31,391 --> 00:40:34,561
- Will you read us
a bedtime story? - No.

448
00:40:34,644 --> 00:40:37,730
But we can't go to sleep
without a bedtime story.

449
00:40:37,814 --> 00:40:41,401
Well, then it's going to be
a long night for you, isn't it?

450
00:40:42,235 --> 00:40:45,864
So, good night, sleep tight,
and don't let the bed bugs bite.

451
00:40:45,947 --> 00:40:49,826
Because there are literally
thousands of them.

452
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:54,038
And there's probably
something in your closet.

453
00:40:55,623 --> 00:40:57,792
He's just kidding, Agnes.

454
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:21,941
It's beautiful.

455
00:41:50,345 --> 00:41:52,805
Girls, let's go.

456
00:41:52,889 --> 00:41:55,725
Time to deliver the cookies!

457
00:41:56,684 --> 00:41:59,354
Okay. But first,
we're going to dance class.

458
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:02,357
Actually, we're going to have to
skip the dance class today.

459
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,986
Actually, we can't
skip the dance class today.

460
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:09,072
We have a big recital coming up.

461
00:42:09,155 --> 00:42:12,408
- We're doing an excerpt
from Swan Lake. - Yeah, Swan Lake!

462
00:42:12,492 --> 00:42:14,244
That's fantastic.
Wonderful.

463
00:42:14,327 --> 00:42:18,414
But we're going to deliver cookies!
Come on!

464
00:42:20,583 --> 00:42:21,626
No.

465
00:42:22,502 --> 00:42:23,545
No?

466
00:42:23,628 --> 00:42:26,840
We're not going to deliver cookies
until we do dance class.

467
00:42:26,923 --> 00:42:28,049
Really?

468
00:42:28,132 --> 00:42:31,845
Well, I am not driving you
to dance class.

469
00:42:31,928 --> 00:42:37,308
So if you want to go, you are going to
have to walk yourselves.

470
00:42:43,398 --> 00:42:44,691
What are you doing?

471
00:42:44,774 --> 00:42:46,526
Walking to dance class.

472
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:48,570
Ya? Okay, fine.

473
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:52,532
You just keep walking,
because I'm really not driving you!

474
00:42:52,615 --> 00:42:53,825
Okay.

475
00:42:55,285 --> 00:42:57,787
You're going to suffer
the wrath of Gru!

476
00:42:58,246 --> 00:43:00,290
Seriously,
I'm going to count to three!

477
00:43:00,373 --> 00:43:02,333
And you had better be in this car!

478
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:06,045
Here we go! One! Two!

479
00:43:06,129 --> 00:43:09,716
...three, four and five.

480
00:43:09,799 --> 00:43:12,719
And lift, and stretch.

481
00:43:12,802 --> 00:43:15,388
And one, and two...

482
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:17,599
- Here you go.
- What is it?

483
00:43:17,682 --> 00:43:21,227
Your ticket to the dance recital.
You are coming, right?

484
00:43:21,311 --> 00:43:22,979
Of course, of course.

485
00:43:23,062 --> 00:43:26,149
I have pins and needles
that I'm sitting on.

486
00:43:26,232 --> 00:43:28,109
Pinkie promise?

487
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:32,530
Oh, yes. My pinkie promises.

488
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:50,423
All right. Our first customer
is a man named Vector.

489
00:43:50,507 --> 00:43:52,258
But he's a V.

490
00:43:52,342 --> 00:43:54,302
You know, we're supposed
to start with the A's.

491
00:43:54,385 --> 00:43:56,304
Then we go to the B's. Then we...

492
00:43:56,387 --> 00:44:01,309
Yes, yes! I went to kindergarten.
I know how the alphabet works!

493
00:44:03,937 --> 00:44:06,606
I was just thinking

494
00:44:06,689 --> 00:44:10,443
that it might be nice
to deliver Mr. Vector's first.

495
00:44:10,527 --> 00:44:12,153
That is all.

496
00:44:15,406 --> 00:44:17,951
Almost over. It's almost over.

497
00:44:20,036 --> 00:44:24,290
Girls, welcome back
to the fortress of Vector-tude!

498
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:27,794
Do you have my cookies for me?

499
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,470
Four boxes of mini-mints,
two toffee totes,

500
00:44:37,554 --> 00:44:42,267
two caramel clumpies
and fifteen boxes of coco-nutties.

501
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:45,937
Exactly. I'd like to see somebody else
order that many cookies.

502
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,105
Not likely.

503
00:44:47,188 --> 00:44:49,357
Name one person
who ordered more cookies than me.

504
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,984
That'll be $52.

505
00:44:51,568 --> 00:44:52,861
Right.

506
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:03,163
Seven, eight, nine...

507
00:45:04,038 --> 00:45:06,624
Tic Tacs! Where was I?

508
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:09,919
Seven, eight, nine...

509
00:45:10,003 --> 00:45:11,796
Why are you wearing pajamas?

510
00:45:12,797 --> 00:45:16,176
These aren't pajamas!
This is a warm-up suit.

511
00:45:32,859 --> 00:45:35,195
- What are you warming up for?
- Stuff.

512
00:45:35,278 --> 00:45:36,321
What sort of stuff?

513
00:45:36,404 --> 00:45:38,823
Super-cool stuff
you wouldn't understand.

514
00:45:38,907 --> 00:45:40,325
Like sleeping?

515
00:45:40,408 --> 00:45:43,286
They are not pajamas!

516
00:45:55,131 --> 00:45:58,343
Here you go, 52 big ones.

517
00:46:16,444 --> 00:46:17,904
Bye!

518
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:13,209
Come on!

519
00:47:35,315 --> 00:47:37,108
What the...

520
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:41,613
Quiet down, fish!

521
00:47:48,661 --> 00:47:49,746
Down, boy!

522
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:16,147
We did it!
Come on, girls, let's go!

523
00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:27,158
But what about the other people
who ordered cookies?

524
00:48:27,242 --> 00:48:29,953
Life is full of disappointments

525
00:48:30,036 --> 00:48:31,788
for some people.

526
00:48:37,502 --> 00:48:39,045
Don't do that!

527
00:48:39,128 --> 00:48:42,131
Super Silly Fun Land!
Can we go? Please?

528
00:48:42,549 --> 00:48:43,633
No.

529
00:48:43,716 --> 00:48:46,219
But we've never been.
And it's the funnest place on earth!

530
00:48:46,302 --> 00:48:47,345
Don't care.

531
00:48:47,428 --> 00:48:48,555
- Please?
- Please?

532
00:48:48,638 --> 00:48:50,265
We'll never ask for anything else,
ever again!

533
00:48:50,348 --> 00:48:52,392
- Pretty please?
- Please?

534
00:48:59,566 --> 00:49:01,484
- Come on!
- Come on!

535
00:49:02,068 --> 00:49:04,362
Light bulb.

536
00:49:09,117 --> 00:49:10,910
Come on!

537
00:49:10,994 --> 00:49:13,955
Goodbye, have fun.

538
00:49:17,375 --> 00:49:20,920
Sorry, dude.
They can't ride without an adult.

539
00:49:21,004 --> 00:49:22,422
What?

540
00:50:19,145 --> 00:50:20,313
Oh, my gosh!

541
00:50:20,396 --> 00:50:22,816
Look at that fluffy unicorn!

542
00:50:25,568 --> 00:50:27,862
He's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!

543
00:50:27,946 --> 00:50:29,405
You've gotta let us play for it!

544
00:50:29,489 --> 00:50:31,199
No, no, no.

545
00:50:31,282 --> 00:50:32,575
Come on!

546
00:50:34,118 --> 00:50:36,663
How much for the fluffy unicorn?

547
00:50:37,872 --> 00:50:39,791
Well, it is not for sale.

548
00:50:39,874 --> 00:50:41,835
But all you gotta do
to win it

549
00:50:41,835 --> 00:50:44,838
is knock down
that little spaceship there.

550
00:50:45,713 --> 00:50:46,840
It's easy!

551
00:50:55,223 --> 00:50:56,516
Yay!

552
00:51:08,486 --> 00:51:09,696
Again!

553
00:51:10,405 --> 00:51:12,866
- Wait!
- Come on. One more time!

554
00:51:12,949 --> 00:51:14,117
Just one more.

555
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,536
I accidentally closed my eyes.

556
00:51:31,885 --> 00:51:33,887
- I hit it! I hit it!
- That was cool.

557
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:41,227
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that?

558
00:51:41,978 --> 00:51:45,064
She hit that.
I saw that with my own eyes.

559
00:51:45,148 --> 00:51:47,901
Hey, buddy,
let me explain something to you.

560
00:51:47,984 --> 00:51:52,530
You see that little tin spaceship?
You see how it's not knocked over?

561
00:51:52,614 --> 00:51:55,450
Do you know what that means,
professor?

562
00:51:55,533 --> 00:51:59,078
It means you don't get
the unicorn!

563
00:52:01,206 --> 00:52:03,082
Somebody's got a frowny face.

564
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:05,585
Boo! Better luck next time!

565
00:52:07,795 --> 00:52:10,507
Okay, my turn.

566
00:52:31,945 --> 00:52:34,447
Knocked over!

567
00:52:38,785 --> 00:52:41,704
- It's so fluffy!
- Yeah!

568
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:44,457
That was awesome!

569
00:52:44,541 --> 00:52:46,167
You blew up the whole thing!

570
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:48,628
Let's go.
Let's try another game!

571
00:52:55,677 --> 00:52:58,096
Gru, do you mind
if I have a quick word?

572
00:52:58,847 --> 00:53:01,099
Okay, girls, go play.

573
00:53:08,648 --> 00:53:10,942
I got the shrink ray!

574
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,780
Cotton candy!

575
00:53:16,781 --> 00:53:20,743
We have 12 days
until the moon is in optimum position.

576
00:53:20,827 --> 00:53:22,954
We can't afford any distractions!

577
00:53:24,706 --> 00:53:25,957
Get me Perkins.

578
00:53:34,007 --> 00:53:36,134
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Perkins,

579
00:53:36,217 --> 00:53:40,180
but I figured
that you would want to see this!

580
00:53:40,972 --> 00:53:42,098
What?

581
00:53:54,611 --> 00:53:57,113
Well done, Gru.
Rather impressive.

582
00:53:57,197 --> 00:54:00,200
Now, the rest of the plan
is simple.

583
00:54:00,825 --> 00:54:04,579
I fly to the moon.
I shrink the moon.

584
00:54:04,662 --> 00:54:08,374
I grab the moon.
I sit on the toilet.

585
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:10,084
What?

586
00:54:10,168 --> 00:54:12,295
Sorry. Sorry!

587
00:54:12,378 --> 00:54:15,507
Could you excuse me
for just one second?

588
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:17,008
I told you not to touch my things.

589
00:54:17,091 --> 00:54:20,094
I told you, I told you.
I've told you a thousand times.

590
00:54:20,178 --> 00:54:21,888
Hey, can we order pizza?

591
00:54:21,971 --> 00:54:23,890
Pizza? You just had lunch.

592
00:54:23,973 --> 00:54:25,141
Not now, for dinner.

593
00:54:25,225 --> 00:54:26,768
Dinner?

594
00:54:26,851 --> 00:54:29,687
Just... Fine, fine, fine, whatever.
Just get back in there!

595
00:54:29,771 --> 00:54:31,564
Can we get stuffed crust?

596
00:54:32,816 --> 00:54:34,067
- Stuffed crust!
- Stuffed crust!

597
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:35,735
I'll stuff you all in the crust!

598
00:54:37,737 --> 00:54:39,113
You're funny!

599
00:54:39,197 --> 00:54:41,950
Just don't come out of that room
again!

600
00:54:42,492 --> 00:54:43,535
All right.

601
00:54:44,452 --> 00:54:47,872
Sorry about that.
Where were we?

602
00:54:47,956 --> 00:54:49,541
You were sitting on the toilet.

603
00:54:49,624 --> 00:54:54,170
No, no, no! No, I'm sorry.
It was a little attempt at humor.

604
00:54:54,254 --> 00:54:57,048
I know how much you like to laugh

605
00:54:59,509 --> 00:55:03,346
inside. Now, I was saying...

606
00:55:06,933 --> 00:55:08,893
You don't seem terribly focused, Gru.

607
00:55:08,977 --> 00:55:11,354
Believe me,
I am completely focused.

608
00:55:11,437 --> 00:55:13,439
- Hello!
- What?

609
00:55:13,523 --> 00:55:14,691
That guy is huge!

610
00:55:14,774 --> 00:55:16,192
- Are we on TV?
- What are those? Children?

611
00:55:16,276 --> 00:55:19,070
What are you doing?
I told you to stay out of here!

612
00:55:24,284 --> 00:55:25,535
No, no, no!

613
00:55:25,618 --> 00:55:26,661
Freeze ray!

614
00:55:26,744 --> 00:55:28,371
Mr. Gru?

615
00:55:33,084 --> 00:55:34,419
Okay.

616
00:55:35,795 --> 00:55:37,172
As I was saying...

617
00:55:37,255 --> 00:55:41,092
No need to continue.
I've seen quite enough.

618
00:55:41,176 --> 00:55:43,553
- But my plan...
- Is a great plan.

619
00:55:43,636 --> 00:55:46,806
I love everything about your plan,
except for one thing.

620
00:55:47,682 --> 00:55:49,017
You.

621
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:55,857
Look, Mom, I drew a picture of me
landing on the moon!

622
00:55:58,943 --> 00:56:02,989
Look, Mom, I made a prototype
of the rocket out of macaroni!

623
00:56:05,617 --> 00:56:09,996
Look, Mom, I made a real rocket
based on the macaroni prototype!

624
00:56:21,257 --> 00:56:23,009
I don't understand.

625
00:56:23,343 --> 00:56:25,637
Let's face reality, Gru.

626
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:30,475
You've been at this for far too long
with far too little success.

627
00:56:30,683 --> 00:56:34,896
We're gonna put our faith,
our money, into a...

628
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,357
Well, a younger villain.

629
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,942
But I...

630
00:56:39,025 --> 00:56:41,110
It's over. Goodbye, Gru.

631
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:06,845
Now, I know there have been
some rumors going around

632
00:57:06,928 --> 00:57:10,223
that the bank
is no longer funding us.

633
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:13,893
Well, I am here
to put those rumors to rest.

634
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,981
They are true.

635
00:57:19,899 --> 00:57:22,110
In terms of money,

636
00:57:23,278 --> 00:57:25,446
we have no money.

637
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:28,116
So how will we get to the moon?

638
00:57:29,284 --> 00:57:31,119
The answer is clear.

639
00:57:31,202 --> 00:57:32,787
We won't.

640
00:57:35,832 --> 00:57:38,126
We are doomed.

641
00:57:39,377 --> 00:57:44,257
Now would probably be a good time
to look for other employment options.

642
00:57:45,884 --> 00:57:47,010
I know.

643
00:57:47,093 --> 00:57:49,721
I have fired up my resume

644
00:57:49,762 --> 00:57:52,307
as I suggest
that all of you do, as well.

645
00:57:53,308 --> 00:57:54,893
What is it?

646
00:57:56,811 --> 00:58:00,106
Can't you see that I am
in the middle of a pep talk?

647
00:58:29,761 --> 00:58:31,137
Yes!

648
00:58:31,221 --> 00:58:34,140
Yes, we will build our own rocket

649
00:58:34,766 --> 00:58:38,311
using this and whatever else
we can find!

650
00:58:38,770 --> 00:58:42,398
Grab everything! Hit the junkyards!
Take apart the cars!

651
00:58:42,899 --> 00:58:44,776
Who needs the bank?

652
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:46,611
Let's go. Let's go!

653
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:38,872
Mom! What are you doing here?

654
00:59:38,955 --> 00:59:41,791
And here he is in the bathtub.

655
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:44,169
Look at his little buns.

656
00:59:46,504 --> 00:59:48,006
Mom.

657
00:59:48,089 --> 00:59:49,465
Not cool.

658
00:59:50,466 --> 00:59:55,013
And here, he's all dressed up
in his Sunday best.

659
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,891
He looks like a girl!

660
00:59:57,974 --> 01:00:01,144
Yes, he does. An ugly girl!

661
01:00:23,958 --> 01:00:25,543
You're funny!

662
01:00:39,057 --> 01:00:42,018
Yes! Mine's shaped like a dead guy!

663
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:02,664
Mr. Perkins, your son is here.

664
01:01:02,747 --> 01:01:04,582
Send him in.

665
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,418
Hey, Dad.

666
01:01:08,253 --> 01:01:09,712
You wanted to see me?

667
01:01:09,796 --> 01:01:12,757
- Yes, I did, Victor.
- I am not Victor any more.

668
01:01:12,841 --> 01:01:16,302
Victor was my nerd name.
Now I am Vector!

669
01:01:16,386 --> 01:01:17,720
Sit down!

670
01:01:19,347 --> 01:01:21,766
Do you know where the shrink ray is?

671
01:01:22,183 --> 01:01:24,144
Duh! Back at my place.

672
01:01:24,227 --> 01:01:27,105
Oh, is that right?
Back at your place? That's cool.

673
01:01:27,188 --> 01:01:31,442
I guess Gru must just have one
that looks exactly like it!

674
01:01:34,028 --> 01:01:37,282
What the...
Those girls sold me cookies!

675
01:01:37,574 --> 01:01:41,327
Do you have any idea
how lucrative this moon heist could be?

676
01:01:41,411 --> 01:01:43,204
I give you the opportunity
of a lifetime,

677
01:01:43,288 --> 01:01:45,123
and you just blow it!

678
01:01:45,999 --> 01:01:49,294
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, really?

679
01:01:49,711 --> 01:01:52,589
You just wait
until Gru sees my latest weapon.

680
01:01:52,672 --> 01:01:55,675
Squid-launcher! Oh, yeah!

681
01:01:58,636 --> 01:02:00,805
There's a squid on my face!

682
01:02:02,348 --> 01:02:03,641
Don't worry.

683
01:02:03,725 --> 01:02:06,978
The moon is as good as ours.

684
01:02:09,814 --> 01:02:11,316
Come on now, it's bedtime.

685
01:02:11,399 --> 01:02:14,569
Did you brush your teeth?
Let me smell. Let me smell.

686
01:02:15,195 --> 01:02:16,571
You did not!

687
01:02:16,654 --> 01:02:20,742
Put on your PGs. Hold still.
Okay, seriously! Seriously!

688
01:02:20,825 --> 01:02:25,330
This is beddie-bye time, right now.
I'm not kidding around. I mean it!

689
01:02:25,413 --> 01:02:28,166
- But we're not tired!
- Well, I am tired.

690
01:02:28,249 --> 01:02:30,460
Will you read us a bedtime story?

691
01:02:34,339 --> 01:02:35,715
No.

692
01:02:35,798 --> 01:02:37,050
Pretty please!

693
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:40,970
The physical appearance of the "please"
makes no difference.

694
01:02:41,054 --> 01:02:43,139
It is still no, so go to sleep.

695
01:02:43,223 --> 01:02:45,350
But we can't. We're all hyper!

696
01:02:45,433 --> 01:02:47,227
And without a bedtime story,

697
01:02:47,227 --> 01:02:49,938
we'll just keep getting up
and bugging you.

698
01:02:50,021 --> 01:02:51,105
All night long.

699
01:02:53,274 --> 01:02:54,526
Fine.

700
01:02:55,568 --> 01:02:58,571
All right, all right.
Sleepy Kittens.

701
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:00,365
Sleepy Kittens?

702
01:03:00,782 --> 01:03:02,200
- What are these?
- Puppets.

703
01:03:02,659 --> 01:03:04,953
You use them when you tell the story.

704
01:03:12,043 --> 01:03:14,587
Okay, let's get this over with.

705
01:03:15,088 --> 01:03:19,342
"Three little kittens loved to play,
they had fun in the sun all day.

706
01:03:19,425 --> 01:03:23,847
Then their mother came out and said,
'Time for kittens to go to bed.'"

707
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:27,809
Wow! This is garbage.
You actually like this?

708
01:03:27,892 --> 01:03:29,352
Keep reading!

709
01:03:30,145 --> 01:03:32,522
- Come on!
- All right, all right, all right.

710
01:03:32,605 --> 01:03:35,191
"Three little kittens started to bawl,

711
01:03:35,275 --> 01:03:37,610
'Mommy, we're not tired at all.'

712
01:03:37,694 --> 01:03:40,238
Their mother smiled
and said with a purr,

713
01:03:40,321 --> 01:03:43,992
'Fine, but at least
you should brush your fur.'"

714
01:03:44,075 --> 01:03:46,244
Now you brush the fur.

715
01:03:47,954 --> 01:03:49,706
This is literature?

716
01:03:49,789 --> 01:03:53,042
A 2-year-old could have written this.
All right.

717
01:03:53,585 --> 01:03:56,588
"Three little kittens
with fur all brushed

718
01:03:56,671 --> 01:04:00,091
said, 'We can't sleep,
we feel too rushed!'

719
01:04:00,175 --> 01:04:03,261
Their mother replied,
with a voice like silk,

720
01:04:03,344 --> 01:04:06,264
'Fine, but at least
you should drink your milk.'"

721
01:04:06,347 --> 01:04:08,683
Now make them drink the milk.

722
01:04:13,021 --> 01:04:16,900
I don't like this book.
This is going on forever.

723
01:04:16,983 --> 01:04:20,361
"Three little kittens,
with milk all gone,

724
01:04:20,361 --> 01:04:23,323
rubbed their eyes
and started to yawn.

725
01:04:29,704 --> 01:04:32,749
'We can't sleep,
we can't even try.'

726
01:04:32,790 --> 01:04:35,502
Then their mother sang a lullaby.

727
01:04:35,585 --> 01:04:41,341
'Good night kittens, close your eyes.
Sleep in peace until you rise.

728
01:04:41,925 --> 01:04:45,136
Though while you sleep,
we are apart,

729
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:49,974
your mommy loves you
with all her heart.'"

730
01:04:53,978 --> 01:04:56,314
The end. Okay, good night.

731
01:04:57,315 --> 01:04:59,567
- Wait!
- What?

732
01:04:59,651 --> 01:05:01,528
What about good night kisses?

733
01:05:03,488 --> 01:05:07,242
No, no. There will be no kissing
or hugging or kissing.

734
01:05:10,161 --> 01:05:12,747
He is not gonna kiss us
good night, Agnes.

735
01:05:13,373 --> 01:05:15,416
I like him. He's nice.

736
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,835
But scary.

737
01:05:18,086 --> 01:05:19,379
Like Santa!

738
01:05:37,897 --> 01:05:42,110
Only 48 hours till the launch,
and all systems are go.

739
01:05:44,362 --> 01:05:46,030
About that,

740
01:05:46,531 --> 01:05:50,785
I was thinking that maybe
we could move the date of the heist.

741
01:05:50,869 --> 01:05:56,457
Please tell me this is not as a result
of the girls' dance recital, is it?

742
01:05:56,541 --> 01:05:58,751
No, no, no!

743
01:05:58,835 --> 01:06:01,880
The recital? Don't... That's stupid!

744
01:06:02,005 --> 01:06:06,885
I just think it's kind of weird
to do it on a Saturday.

745
01:06:06,968 --> 01:06:12,557
I was thinking, maybe a heist
is a Tuesday thing, right?

746
01:06:13,266 --> 01:06:16,895
Gru, you and I have been
working on this for years.

747
01:06:16,978 --> 01:06:19,063
It's everything we've dreamed of.

748
01:06:19,147 --> 01:06:21,065
Your chance to make history,

749
01:06:21,149 --> 01:06:24,360
become the man who stole the moon!

750
01:06:24,444 --> 01:06:28,239
But these girls
are becoming a major distraction!

751
01:06:28,323 --> 01:06:29,657
They need to go.

752
01:06:30,408 --> 01:06:34,412
If you don't do something about it,
then I will.

753
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,749
I understand.

754
01:06:40,251 --> 01:06:41,753
Good.

755
01:06:44,881 --> 01:06:46,049
Butt.

756
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:50,470
Butt.

757
01:07:03,024 --> 01:07:04,192
Butt.

758
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:09,823
All right.
Now, when we put our cups together,

759
01:07:09,906 --> 01:07:12,575
we will make the "clink" sound
with our mouths.

760
01:07:12,659 --> 01:07:13,827
Ready? Edith?

761
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:14,953
- Clink.
- Clink.

762
01:07:15,036 --> 01:07:17,038
There we go. And now we drink.

763
01:07:17,789 --> 01:07:18,832
And Agnes?

764
01:07:18,915 --> 01:07:19,999
- Clink.
- Clink.

765
01:07:20,083 --> 01:07:21,459
Very good!

766
01:07:23,169 --> 01:07:24,546
Excuse me, girls.

767
01:07:24,921 --> 01:07:26,047
Come on!

768
01:07:26,130 --> 01:07:29,676
Don't worry, I'll be back.
Keep clinking.

769
01:07:30,134 --> 01:07:31,261
- Clink, clink.
- Clink, clink.

770
01:07:33,638 --> 01:07:35,515
Miss Hattie,
what are you doing here?

771
01:07:35,598 --> 01:07:36,891
I'm here for the girls.

772
01:07:36,891 --> 01:07:39,519
I received a call that
you wanted to return them.

773
01:07:42,105 --> 01:07:46,359
And also,
I did purchase a Spanish dictionary.

774
01:07:49,779 --> 01:07:50,989
I didn't like what you said.

775
01:07:51,072 --> 01:07:52,448
But...

776
01:07:58,746 --> 01:08:01,332
I will get the girls ready.

777
01:08:11,217 --> 01:08:13,678
Don't let her take us, Mr. Gru!

778
01:08:14,929 --> 01:08:16,806
Tell her you wanna keep us.

779
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:18,892
All right, girls. Come on, let's go.

780
01:08:18,975 --> 01:08:21,478
Goodbye, Mr. Gru.
Thanks for everything.

781
01:08:37,577 --> 01:08:39,662
I did it for your own good.

782
01:08:40,038 --> 01:08:43,124
Come on, let's go get that moon.

783
01:08:44,959 --> 01:08:46,044
Right.

784
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:03,746
What is this for?

785
01:10:05,415 --> 01:10:06,708
The recital?

786
01:10:06,791 --> 01:10:10,044
I am the greatest criminal mind
of the century.

787
01:10:10,128 --> 01:10:14,215
I don't go
to little girls' dance recitals!

788
01:10:35,028 --> 01:10:39,991
Opening launch bay doors.
Commencing launch sequence.

789
01:10:40,074 --> 01:10:45,079
And we are good to go
in T minus 10 seconds.

790
01:10:46,164 --> 01:10:50,627
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

791
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:51,753
six...

792
01:11:17,821 --> 01:11:19,072
Oh, yeah!

793
01:11:21,032 --> 01:11:23,576
Nice work, Doctor.
All systems go.

794
01:11:23,993 --> 01:11:25,078
Boo-ya!

795
01:11:36,339 --> 01:11:37,924
My flight suit.

796
01:11:39,676 --> 01:11:42,846
Oh, yeah! Once again, the mighty...

797
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,390
I've got it!

798
01:13:10,892 --> 01:13:13,686
I've got the moon!

799
01:13:13,812 --> 01:13:16,606
I've got the moon!

800
01:13:31,704 --> 01:13:33,206
I can make it!

801
01:13:40,463 --> 01:13:42,799
- Wait a minute!
- Kevin!

802
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:47,512
Come on, come on!

803
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:57,355
He's still not here.

804
01:13:57,438 --> 01:13:59,858
Why would he come?
He gave us up.

805
01:13:59,941 --> 01:14:01,484
But he pinkie promised!

806
01:14:01,568 --> 01:14:04,320
Girls, girls, places!

807
01:14:04,404 --> 01:14:07,198
No, we can't start yet!
We're still expecting someone.

808
01:14:07,282 --> 01:14:09,659
Can we just wait a few more minutes?

809
01:14:13,496 --> 01:14:15,915
All right.
But just a few more minutes.

810
01:14:15,999 --> 01:14:18,084
He's not coming, guys.

811
01:14:21,546 --> 01:14:23,548
Gru! Gru, can you hear me?

812
01:14:25,884 --> 01:14:29,429
Quick, we have to warn him, and fast!

813
01:15:04,422 --> 01:15:06,424
Okay, okay. There's the library.

814
01:15:06,508 --> 01:15:09,219
That's Third Street.
The dance studio...

815
01:15:09,302 --> 01:15:10,720
There! There! There it is!

816
01:15:48,174 --> 01:15:50,593
Sorry, buddy. Show's over.

817
01:15:50,927 --> 01:15:52,554
Over?

818
01:16:30,508 --> 01:16:32,010
Vector, open up!

819
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:36,264
First give me the moon.
Then we'll talk.

820
01:16:49,819 --> 01:16:52,322
- Mr. Gru!
- Zip it, Happy Meal.

821
01:16:52,405 --> 01:16:53,907
Now, the girls.

822
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:58,369
Actually, I think I'll hold on to them
a little while longer.

823
01:16:58,453 --> 01:16:59,496
No!

824
01:16:59,579 --> 01:17:02,248
Oh, yeah! Unpredictable!

825
01:17:02,957 --> 01:17:04,459
Listen close, you little punk.

826
01:17:04,542 --> 01:17:07,879
When I get in there,
you are in for a world of pain!

827
01:17:09,172 --> 01:17:11,007
I'm really scared!

828
01:17:14,469 --> 01:17:16,304
He is gonna kick your butt.

829
01:17:56,594 --> 01:17:58,471
What? He punched my shark!

830
01:18:25,206 --> 01:18:26,332
There he is!

831
01:18:32,255 --> 01:18:33,506
Hang on, Gru.

832
01:18:38,845 --> 01:18:40,138
Oh, no!

833
01:18:50,440 --> 01:18:52,275
Vector has the girls. Go!

834
01:18:56,279 --> 01:18:57,947
What happened to the ship?
It's big again!

835
01:18:58,031 --> 01:19:00,783
- Not as big as the moon
is going to be! - What?

836
01:19:00,867 --> 01:19:03,119
The larger the mass of an object,

837
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:05,955
the quicker the effects
of the shrink ray wear off!

838
01:19:06,039 --> 01:19:08,958
I call it the Nefario Principle.

839
01:19:09,042 --> 01:19:10,960
I just came up with it now,
actually.

840
01:19:11,794 --> 01:19:13,296
Oh, no!

841
01:19:19,344 --> 01:19:20,678
Did you see that?

842
01:19:20,804 --> 01:19:23,515
- Vector! Help!
- Vector!

843
01:19:23,598 --> 01:19:24,808
- Over here!
- Hey!

844
01:19:24,891 --> 01:19:26,518
What are you girls
doing back there?

845
01:19:26,601 --> 01:19:27,644
The moon!

846
01:19:43,785 --> 01:19:44,828
Watch out!

847
01:19:48,665 --> 01:19:50,458
Get as close in as you can.

848
01:19:51,292 --> 01:19:52,585
You got it.

849
01:20:08,935 --> 01:20:11,146
- Mr. Gru, up here!
- Mr. Gru!

850
01:20:11,229 --> 01:20:13,273
Okay, girls! Girls!

851
01:20:13,356 --> 01:20:16,067
- You're going to have to jump.
- Jump?

852
01:20:16,151 --> 01:20:18,069
Are you insane?

853
01:20:18,153 --> 01:20:19,571
Don't worry, I will catch you.

854
01:20:20,488 --> 01:20:21,906
You gave us back!

855
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:26,161
I know, I know. And it is
the worst mistake I ever made.

856
01:20:26,744 --> 01:20:28,663
But you have to jump now.

857
01:20:29,247 --> 01:20:31,332
It'll be okay.

858
01:20:36,296 --> 01:20:37,338
Okay, girls.

859
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:40,925
Jump now!

860
01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:48,224
Margo, I will catch you.

861
01:20:48,892 --> 01:20:51,936
And I will never let you go again.

862
01:21:01,529 --> 01:21:03,573
- Not so fast!
- No!

863
01:21:03,656 --> 01:21:04,908
Let me go!

864
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:09,954
Margo!

865
01:21:15,752 --> 01:21:17,962
I'm coming, Margo.
Hang on!

866
01:21:46,908 --> 01:21:48,409
I got you.

867
01:22:06,553 --> 01:22:07,679
No!

868
01:22:24,863 --> 01:22:26,114
Oh, poop.

869
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:29,033
This time, good triumphs,

870
01:22:29,117 --> 01:22:32,245
and the moon has been returned
to its rightful place in the sky.

871
01:22:32,620 --> 01:22:37,250
But once again, law enforcement
is baffled, leaving everyone to wonder,

872
01:22:37,333 --> 01:22:39,127
who is this mysterious hero?

873
01:22:39,210 --> 01:22:41,171
And what will he do next?

874
01:22:41,713 --> 01:22:43,506
Okay, girls. Time for bed.

875
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:47,302
- Come on! We want a story.
- Three sleepy kittens!

876
01:22:47,385 --> 01:22:51,639
Oh, no! Sorry. That book was
accidentally destroyed maliciously.

877
01:22:53,057 --> 01:22:56,269
Tonight we are going to read
a new book.

878
01:22:56,352 --> 01:22:58,563
This one is called

879
01:22:58,646 --> 01:23:02,317
One Big Unicorn by...
Who wrote this?

880
01:23:03,109 --> 01:23:06,821
Me! I wrote it.
Look, it's a puppet book!

881
01:23:07,614 --> 01:23:09,324
Here, watch this.

882
01:23:10,492 --> 01:23:12,327
That's the horn!

883
01:23:16,331 --> 01:23:18,416
This is gonna be the best book ever!

884
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:23,296
Not to pat myself on the back,
but, yes, it probably will be.

885
01:23:23,379 --> 01:23:24,464
Here we go.

886
01:23:24,547 --> 01:23:27,550
"One big unicorn, strong and free

887
01:23:27,634 --> 01:23:30,345
thought he was happy as he could be.

888
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:35,141
Then three little kittens came around

889
01:23:35,475 --> 01:23:39,229
and turned his whole life
upside down."

890
01:23:39,312 --> 01:23:41,064
Hey, that one looks like me!

891
01:23:41,147 --> 01:23:43,274
No, what are you talking about?
These are kittens!

892
01:23:43,358 --> 01:23:47,111
Any relation to persons living or dead
is completely coincidental.

893
01:23:50,657 --> 01:23:53,034
"They made him laugh.

894
01:23:53,117 --> 01:23:55,328
They made him cry.

895
01:23:57,580 --> 01:24:00,041
He never should have said goodbye.

896
01:24:00,875 --> 01:24:05,463
And now he knows he could never part

897
01:24:05,547 --> 01:24:08,133
from those three little kittens

898
01:24:08,633 --> 01:24:11,553
that changed his heart.

899
01:24:11,636 --> 01:24:13,721
The end."

900
01:24:13,805 --> 01:24:16,141
Okay, all right. Good night.

901
01:24:39,455 --> 01:24:41,082
I love you.

902
01:24:41,624 --> 01:24:43,334
I love you, too.

903
01:24:52,677 --> 01:24:54,512
No, no!

904
01:24:56,723 --> 01:24:57,849
All right.

905
01:25:02,854 --> 01:25:05,023
Didn't I get you already?

906
01:25:38,848 --> 01:25:40,850
They're very good!

907
01:25:40,934 --> 01:25:43,895
I'm so proud of you, Son.

908
01:25:43,978 --> 01:25:46,898
You've turned out to be
a great parent!

909
01:25:48,024 --> 01:25:49,526
Just like me.

910
01:25:50,109 --> 01:25:52,362
Maybe even better.

911
01:26:19,681 --> 01:26:21,391
No, I'm fine. Go ahead.

912
01:26:23,143 --> 01:26:24,602
No, no, no!

913
01:28:04,244 --> 01:28:05,829
Hey, Carl! Hey.

914
01:28:10,083 --> 01:28:11,167
No, no, no.

915
01:28:11,251 --> 01:28:12,460
Me, me, me.

916
01:28:13,795 --> 01:28:14,838
John?

917
01:28:14,921 --> 01:28:16,381
No, no. Me, me, me.

918
01:28:40,113 --> 01:28:41,156
Oh, poop.

919
01:29:27,869 --> 01:29:29,078
Oh, no!

920
01:29:29,913 --> 01:29:31,372
Stop! Stop!

921
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:33,977
Hello, I am Gru.

922
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:37,063
Back to work, back to work!
Back to...
