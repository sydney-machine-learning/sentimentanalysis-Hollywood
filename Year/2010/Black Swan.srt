00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,964
I had the craziest dream last night.

3
00:03:17,407 --> 00:03:19,314
I was dancing the White Swan.

4
00:03:21,072 --> 00:03:24,278
It was different choreography, though.
It was more like the Bolshoi's.

5
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:29,919
It was the prologue,

6
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:32,741
when Rothbart casts his spell.

7
00:03:42,038 --> 00:03:45,166
Look how pink. So pretty...

8
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:47,965
Pretty!

9
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,025
- You're in a good mood.
- He promised to feature me more this season.

10
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,238
Well, he certainly should.

11
00:03:54,273 --> 00:03:56,167
You've been there long enough,

12
00:03:56,202 --> 00:03:59,052
and you're the most dedicated
dancer in the company.

13
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:04,419
Up.

14
00:04:06,253 --> 00:04:07,288
- What's that?
- What?

15
00:04:07,323 --> 00:04:08,487
There.

16
00:04:12,296 --> 00:04:12,933
Nothing.

17
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:18,855
You're sure you don't want me
to come with you?

18
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:23,046
You're a sweet girl.

19
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:38,301
Did you see Beth today?

20
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:40,575
I can't believe she's back.

21
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,958
- Of course she's back.
- What, she can't take a hint?

22
00:05:43,993 --> 00:05:47,196
The company is broke.
No one comes to see her anymore.

23
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:49,883
Oh, nobody actually comes
to see ballet full stop.

24
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,300
That's not true. I heard The Royal
had one of their best seasons yet.

25
00:05:53,335 --> 00:05:55,251
He just needs to try something new.
That's all.

26
00:05:55,286 --> 00:05:57,953
No, someone new.

27
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,124
- Like who?
- Like someone who's not approaching menopause.

28
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:03,592
It's sad.

29
00:06:03,627 --> 00:06:05,259
What's sad?

30
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:11,493
Beth's such a beautiful dancer.

31
00:06:11,528 --> 00:06:13,064
Yeah, so is my grandmother.

32
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,607
- Well Fonteyn danced into her fifties.
- Yeah, we know.

33
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,033
Great.

34
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:27,560
Thought I'd fucking missed my stop.

35
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,015
It's a hell-fit all the way from 79th.

36
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:23,314
Beautiful as always, Nina.

37
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:25,581
Relax.

38
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:33,198
And one, and two,
and three, and four.

39
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:41,722
Stop, John.
One second.

40
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:54,509
Okay, take position.

41
00:07:54,544 --> 00:07:58,495
And one, and two,
and three, and up.

42
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,954
And one, and two,
and three, and four.

43
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,259
Hello, dear.

44
00:08:23,299 --> 00:08:24,933
We all know the story.

45
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:27,678
Virginal girl, pure and sweet,

46
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:30,348
trapped in the body of a swan.

47
00:08:30,383 --> 00:08:33,856
She desires freedom

48
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:36,829
that only true love can break the spell.

49
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:45,172
Her wish is nearly granted
in the form of a Prince.

50
00:08:45,207 --> 00:08:49,376
But before he can declare his love,

51
00:08:49,411 --> 00:08:55,491
The lustful twin, the Black Swan,
tricks and seduces him.

52
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:05,370
Devastated,
the White Swan leaps off a cliff,

53
00:09:05,405 --> 00:09:10,334
killing herself.
And in death...

54
00:09:10,369 --> 00:09:13,161
finds freedom.

55
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,747
- Good morning, company.
- Good morning.

56
00:09:23,712 --> 00:09:26,035
We will open our season
with <i>Swan Lake</i>.

57
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,264
Done to death, I know.

58
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:29,864
But not like this.

59
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:34,762
We strip it down,
make it visceral and real.

60
00:09:36,802 --> 00:09:39,653
A new production
needs a new Swan Queen.

61
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:43,402
A fresh face to present to the world.

62
00:09:45,758 --> 00:09:50,637
But... Which of you
can embody both Swans?

63
00:09:51,772 --> 00:09:54,005
The White, and the Black.

64
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,027
All the soloists I tapped:

65
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:06,131
Go to your scheduled rehearsals
this afternoon.

66
00:10:08,947 --> 00:10:10,746
And the girls I didn't tap:

67
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:15,056
Meet me in the principals' studio at 5:00.

68
00:10:15,091 --> 00:10:16,532
Thank you.

69
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:21,821
All right.

70
00:10:21,856 --> 00:10:24,526
- Let's go. Did we do left side?
- Yes, mistress.

71
00:11:02,055 --> 00:11:02,640
Fuck! Fuck!

72
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:09,344
What?

73
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:53,052
If I was only casting the White Swan,
she'd be yours.

74
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:56,074
But I'm not.

75
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,850
Maestro, Odile's coda, please.

76
00:12:58,885 --> 00:13:00,627
Now show me your Black Swan, Nina.

77
00:13:24,575 --> 00:13:27,255
Not so controlled.
Seduce us.

78
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,560
Not just the Prince, but the court,
the audience, the entire world.

79
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:33,751
Come on,
like a spider spinning a web.

80
00:13:33,786 --> 00:13:36,242
Attack it, attack it!
Come on!

81
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:48,348
Well...

82
00:13:48,383 --> 00:13:50,673
- Good of you to join us.
- Sorry...

83
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,558
Girls, this is Lily.

84
00:13:52,593 --> 00:13:56,167
Straight off the plane from San Francisco.
She's filling Rebecca's old spot.

85
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,860
- Hey.
- Get warmed up.

86
00:13:57,895 --> 00:13:58,744
No, it's okay.

87
00:13:58,779 --> 00:13:59,951
I'm good.

88
00:14:02,523 --> 00:14:03,313
Should I go again?

89
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,232
No, thanks, Nina.
I've seen enough.

90
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:11,829
Veronica, the White Swan variation.

91
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:16,718
Come on, come on, come on, please.

92
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:19,644
All right, Maestro.

93
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:22,378
Two, three...

94
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:29,633
So how'd it go?

95
00:15:31,627 --> 00:15:33,628
You were late, so I called
Susie in the office.

96
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:36,806
An audition! I can't believe
he just sprang that on you.

97
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:39,014
So?

98
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:40,841
It was fine.

99
00:15:40,876 --> 00:15:42,823
Just fine?

100
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:46,465
Oh, sweetheart...

101
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:50,297
You tell me about it.

102
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:45,746
Nina, everything all right?

103
00:16:45,781 --> 00:16:46,787
I'm fine.

104
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,408
Almost done.

105
00:17:02,443 --> 00:17:04,615
You're working yourself too hard.

106
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,220
- We all have off days.
- That girl, um, barged in.

107
00:17:10,255 --> 00:17:12,093
I'm sure she didn't mean to.

108
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:20,338
For a starter, if I hadn't taken you to each of
your classes, you'd have been completely lost.

109
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,847
I'm going to talk to him tomorrow.
I'm going to tell him I finished it.

110
00:17:22,882 --> 00:17:24,308
You don't need to lie.

111
00:17:25,447 --> 00:17:27,078
You won't convince him
one way or the other.

112
00:17:30,957 --> 00:17:31,962
Oh, sweetheart.

113
00:17:34,466 --> 00:17:35,660
I know it's disappointing.

114
00:17:37,261 --> 00:17:39,338
When you start getting older,
there's all this

115
00:17:40,532 --> 00:17:43,105
ridiculous pressure.
God knows I understand.

116
00:17:45,112 --> 00:17:46,222
But it's all right.

117
00:17:47,616 --> 00:17:49,143
No matter what.

118
00:17:50,989 --> 00:17:53,851
You'll probably get to dance
the part of the cat again.

119
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:57,233
That's such a wonderful part.

120
00:17:57,268 --> 00:17:59,978
Or maybe he'll make you a big swan.

121
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:03,946
Either way, you'll shine.

122
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,616
You know...

123
00:18:08,095 --> 00:18:09,431
Everything will be better
in the morning.

124
00:18:12,207 --> 00:18:13,725
It always is.

125
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:18,136
Sweet girl.

126
00:18:44,406 --> 00:18:45,096
Yes, Nina?

127
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:46,411
Do you have a minute?

128
00:18:50,321 --> 00:18:52,411
- Now's not a good time. I get it.
- Now is perfect.

129
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:56,343
So...

130
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:01,342
I just wanted to tell you that

131
00:19:01,377 --> 00:19:04,265
I practiced the coda last night and

132
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,148
I finished.

133
00:19:11,293 --> 00:19:12,476
I thought you should know.

134
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,321
Okay, Nina, listen. Honestly,
I don't care about your technique.

135
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:19,307
- You should know that by now.
- Yeah, but yesterday...

136
00:19:19,342 --> 00:19:20,477
No.
Anyway...

137
00:19:20,512 --> 00:19:22,925
I've already chosen Veronica.
Sorry.

138
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,694
Sorry.

139
00:19:26,968 --> 00:19:27,776
Okay, thank you.

140
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:31,681
That's it?

141
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:34,202
You're not going to
try and change my mind?

142
00:19:36,197 --> 00:19:37,604
You must have thought
it was possible.

143
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:40,898
Otherwise, what are you
doing here all dolled up?

144
00:19:43,454 --> 00:19:45,098
I came to ask for the part.

145
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:50,566
Well...

146
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:53,533
The truth is...

147
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:57,470
When I look at you,
all I see is the White Swan.

148
00:19:57,505 --> 00:20:01,709
Yes, you're beautiful,
fearful, fragile.

149
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,527
Ideal casting.

150
00:20:05,755 --> 00:20:08,886
But the Black Swan?
It's a hard fucking job to dance both.

151
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,580
I can dance the Black Swan, too.

152
00:20:11,615 --> 00:20:12,718
Really?

153
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,809
In four years,
every time you dance,

154
00:20:15,844 --> 00:20:20,692
I see obsess getting each and every move
perfectly right, but I never see you lose yourself.

155
00:20:21,868 --> 00:20:24,814
Ever.
All that discipline for what?

156
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:30,251
- I just want to be perfect.
- You what?

157
00:20:31,937 --> 00:20:33,067
I want to be perfect.

158
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:38,219
Perfection is not just about control.

159
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:41,844
It's also about letting go.

160
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:46,509
Surprise yourself so you can
surprise the audience. Transcendence.

161
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:48,756
And very few have it in them.

162
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,372
I think I do have it in me.

163
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:00,210
You bit me?

164
00:21:00,245 --> 00:21:03,312
I can't believe you bit me!

165
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:04,918
I'm sorry.

166
00:21:04,953 --> 00:21:07,129
Man, that fucking hurt!

167
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,743
What?

168
00:21:24,778 --> 00:21:26,952
Why's she always staring at me?

169
00:21:29,517 --> 00:21:31,313
Hey, it's been posted.

170
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:33,907
Hey, it's up!

171
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,659
Veronica.

172
00:21:42,846 --> 00:21:43,698
Congratulations.

173
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,167
Hey!

174
00:22:01,527 --> 00:22:02,399
Why would you say that?

175
00:22:04,112 --> 00:22:05,604
Your idea of some sick joke?

176
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:07,004
What?

177
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:09,471
Fuck you.

178
00:22:23,795 --> 00:22:24,439
Hey, Nina!

179
00:22:24,474 --> 00:22:25,907
Congratulations!

180
00:22:32,395 --> 00:22:33,679
Congratulations.

181
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:35,143
You're so beautiful.

182
00:22:37,278 --> 00:22:38,129
Congratulations.

183
00:22:55,384 --> 00:22:56,680
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hi.

184
00:22:56,715 --> 00:22:58,658
<i>What is it?
What's wrong?</i>

185
00:22:58,693 --> 00:23:00,264
I'm fine.

186
00:23:02,412 --> 00:23:03,805
He picked me, Mom.

187
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:08,138
Do you hear me?

188
00:23:08,173 --> 00:23:11,026
<i>- For Swan Lake?</i>
- I'm going to be Swan Queen!

189
00:23:13,241 --> 00:23:14,487
Mom!

190
00:23:14,522 --> 00:23:16,954
I'll be home soon.
I just wanted to let you know.

191
00:23:18,011 --> 00:23:19,056
<i>- I love you.</i>
- I love you, too.

192
00:23:54,257 --> 00:23:54,920
Mom?

193
00:23:58,605 --> 00:23:59,658
Mom, are you in your room?

194
00:24:33,498 --> 00:24:34,289
Nina?

195
00:24:34,324 --> 00:24:35,760
Are you home?

196
00:24:48,526 --> 00:24:50,052
Nina, when you get out
I'm in the kitchen.

197
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:53,496
Come on, sweetie.

198
00:24:57,793 --> 00:25:00,228
My daughter, the Swan Queen.

199
00:25:05,186 --> 00:25:08,203
It's our favorite.
Vanilla with strawberry filling.

200
00:25:08,238 --> 00:25:09,797
Oh, Mom, not too big.

201
00:25:09,832 --> 00:25:11,772
Oh, that's way, way too much.

202
00:25:11,807 --> 00:25:13,894
- It's a celebration. It's just this once.
- Mom...

203
00:25:14,975 --> 00:25:16,394
My stomach's still in knots.

204
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:19,869
Fine.

205
00:25:19,904 --> 00:25:21,730
Fine.

206
00:25:21,765 --> 00:25:23,013
Then it's garbage!

207
00:25:23,048 --> 00:25:25,265
No, Mom, don't.
I'm sorry.

208
00:25:32,617 --> 00:25:36,737
I'm just...
I'm just so proud of you.

209
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:39,507
It looks so yummy.

210
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,885
Okay, okay.

211
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,390
Thank you.
Thank you.

212
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:56,476
Thank you, Nina.

213
00:26:56,511 --> 00:26:58,262
That's very nice.

214
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:00,445
Very nice.

215
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:05,252
But I knew the White Swan
wouldn't be a problem.

216
00:27:05,287 --> 00:27:08,982
The real work will your
metamorphosis into her evil twin.

217
00:27:10,942 --> 00:27:12,758
And I know I saw
a flash of her yesterday.

218
00:27:14,315 --> 00:27:16,068
So get ready to give me
more of that bite.

219
00:27:38,577 --> 00:27:39,390
Excellent.

220
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:45,416
That evil force is pulling you that you
can't escape. That's just out of your control.

221
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,072
So you sense it, you get aware of it more:
"It's taking me, it's taking me."

222
00:27:51,107 --> 00:27:53,772
A little bit more desperate.

223
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:58,549
Right, and you can maybe go up a little bit
and then come down, and then...

224
00:27:58,584 --> 00:27:59,847
That's it.

225
00:28:34,878 --> 00:28:36,197
Watch the way she moves.

226
00:28:37,756 --> 00:28:41,537
Imprecise,
but effortless.

227
00:28:43,893 --> 00:28:45,042
She's not faking it.

228
00:28:45,077 --> 00:28:54,163
Gorgeous!
Okay, that's beautiful.

229
00:28:54,198 --> 00:28:56,043
Let's start again from the beginning.

230
00:29:05,286 --> 00:29:07,961
You'll room with Beth from now on,
so be considerate.

231
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,330
Thanks, Susie.

232
00:29:10,215 --> 00:29:11,784
Those are for you, from Mr. Leroy.

233
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:13,764
They're beautiful.

234
00:29:32,051 --> 00:29:33,067
I'll be back in a second.

235
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:37,423
Let me come back to you, please.

236
00:29:41,306 --> 00:29:41,772
Let's go.

237
00:29:47,692 --> 00:29:49,025
Ready to be thrown to the wolves?

238
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,686
We need our cash,
so please don't forget to smile.

239
00:29:52,721 --> 00:29:57,044
Ladies and gentlemen, please,
may I have your attention?

240
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,597
Good evening.

241
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:02,477
Let me make this
very important announcement.

242
00:30:02,512 --> 00:30:08,742
You all had had the chance and
the privilege to be enchanted, transported,

243
00:30:08,743 --> 00:30:11,542
and even sometimes devastated,
by the performances

244
00:30:11,555 --> 00:30:13,576
of this true artist of our company.

245
00:30:13,584 --> 00:30:16,596
She's been a crucial
inspiration to my work.

246
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:20,414
A role model to all dancers,
and even more than that,

247
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:23,436
a deeply appreciated
presence on our stage.

248
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:25,563
You all know who I am talking about.

249
00:30:25,598 --> 00:30:28,906
Ladies and gentlemen, Beth Macintyre.

250
00:30:34,363 --> 00:30:35,351
But as we all know,

251
00:30:35,386 --> 00:30:37,765
every great career
has to come to an end.

252
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,654
Beth is retiring at the end of season.

253
00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:46,991
She will be giving her
farewell performance as Melpomene,

254
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:49,549
the role she originated
in my first ballet.

255
00:30:52,137 --> 00:30:53,605
My little princess,

256
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,909
we honor you.
You will be greatly missed,

257
00:30:57,662 --> 00:31:00,001
and never forgotten.

258
00:31:00,036 --> 00:31:04,098
But as we bid <i>adieu</i> to one star,
we welcome another.

259
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,120
We're opening our season
with my new version of <i>Swan Lake</i>.

260
00:31:08,155 --> 00:31:13,128
Taking the role of our new Swan Queen,
the exquisite Nina Sayers.

261
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:21,503
You'll soon have the pleasure
of seeing her perform,

262
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:28,997
but right now, let's please raise a glass:
To all of us. To Beth. To Nina.

263
00:31:31,374 --> 00:31:32,115
To beauty.

264
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:50,952
Just a second.

265
00:32:00,255 --> 00:32:01,153
Just a second!

266
00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:24,303
Come on!
I'm about to burst!

267
00:32:31,177 --> 00:32:32,621
Hey, it's you!

268
00:32:32,656 --> 00:32:35,232
I don't think we ever
officially met.

269
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:37,919
- I'm Lily.
- Hi, I'm Nina.

270
00:32:37,954 --> 00:32:40,139
Yes, our new Swan Queen.

271
00:32:40,174 --> 00:32:41,737
- Here, hold this.
- Yeah, sure.

272
00:32:43,176 --> 00:32:46,847
You must be so excited.

273
00:32:48,708 --> 00:32:50,296
Are you freaking out?

274
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:51,368
- Yeah...
- Yeah?

275
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:54,442
Oh, it's okay.

276
00:32:54,477 --> 00:32:56,309
Oh, I'd be losing my mind.

277
00:32:56,344 --> 00:32:58,568
I should get back...

278
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:00,307
No, no, no, come on, stay.

279
00:33:00,342 --> 00:33:02,133
Keep me company.

280
00:33:05,842 --> 00:33:06,631
Excuse me.

281
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:10,018
Oh, there you are.
Come on.

282
00:33:15,758 --> 00:33:18,702
Hey. They tried to eat you alive,
but here you are.

283
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,014
You did well.

284
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:22,418
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

285
00:33:23,705 --> 00:33:24,507
Where are you going?

286
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:26,861
Upper west side.

287
00:33:26,896 --> 00:33:28,669
Stop at my place for a drink.
It's on the way.

288
00:33:28,704 --> 00:33:32,466
Thomas, you need to say hello
to Karen Holloway.

289
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:36,908
A minute more of ass-kissing.
I'll be back. Wait for me here, all right?

290
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:40,943
Hello, Karen!

291
00:34:23,296 --> 00:34:24,117
Beth!

292
00:34:26,242 --> 00:34:28,048
I'm so sorry to hear
you're leaving the company.

293
00:34:30,408 --> 00:34:31,907
What did you do to get this role?

294
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,942
He always said you were
such a frigid little girl.

295
00:34:37,977 --> 00:34:41,392
What did you do to make
him change his mind?

296
00:34:41,427 --> 00:34:45,551
Did you suck his cock?

297
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:47,317
Not all of us have to.

298
00:34:50,123 --> 00:34:51,495
You fucking whore!

299
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:54,897
You're a fucking little whore!

300
00:34:54,932 --> 00:34:56,343
Whoa, what's going on here?

301
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:59,508
Hey, I need to talk to you.

302
00:34:59,543 --> 00:35:01,676
- You're drunk. You should go home.
- I need to talk to you.

303
00:35:01,711 --> 00:35:05,394
No! Don't you do that!
Don't you dismiss me like that!

304
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:10,576
My little princess, please.
Pull it together.

305
00:35:12,384 --> 00:35:13,985
- Come.
- I'm coming by later.

306
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,696
I have something for you.
It's a token of my appreciation.

307
00:35:18,731 --> 00:35:21,458
- Right.
- You make the most of it, Nina.

308
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:24,020
Don't worry. It's typical.

309
00:35:29,964 --> 00:35:32,821
Please. I thought it'd be good
to talk about the role.

310
00:35:32,856 --> 00:35:34,162
Drown this a little.

311
00:35:34,197 --> 00:35:36,446
I don't want there to be
any boundaries between us.

312
00:35:36,481 --> 00:35:38,529
- No, me neither.
- Good.

313
00:35:38,564 --> 00:35:42,931
So...
You got a boyfriend?

314
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,173
No.

315
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:49,055
Have you had many in the past?

316
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,126
A few.

317
00:35:51,161 --> 00:35:52,811
But no one serious.

318
00:35:57,671 --> 00:35:58,672
You're not a virgin are you?

319
00:36:02,209 --> 00:36:02,874
No.

320
00:36:02,909 --> 00:36:05,121
So there's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

321
00:36:10,328 --> 00:36:12,367
And you enjoy making love?

322
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:14,721
Excuse me?

323
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:16,907
Come on, sex.

324
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:18,339
Do you enjoy it?

325
00:36:21,334 --> 00:36:23,196
We need to be able
to talk about this.

326
00:36:31,244 --> 00:36:32,999
I've got a little homework
assignment for you.

327
00:36:33,034 --> 00:36:37,491
Go home and touch yourself.

328
00:36:39,537 --> 00:36:40,605
Live a little.

329
00:36:44,771 --> 00:36:47,467
Well it's late.
Lots of work tomorrow.

330
00:36:47,502 --> 00:36:50,398
The doorman will
find a cab for you.

331
00:36:54,954 --> 00:36:57,773
Sounds like quite an evening.
I wish I could have been there.

332
00:36:57,808 --> 00:36:59,343
You know I asked.

333
00:36:59,378 --> 00:37:01,149
I know you did.
Susie told me.

334
00:37:01,184 --> 00:37:04,058
Guess he wanted you
all to himself.

335
00:37:04,093 --> 00:37:05,214
But why?

336
00:37:05,249 --> 00:37:07,638
Don't blame him.

337
00:37:10,088 --> 00:37:11,101
Where'd you get these?

338
00:37:11,136 --> 00:37:12,960
They're fake.

339
00:37:15,127 --> 00:37:17,380
Fooled me.

340
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:24,669
I can do it.

341
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,877
He must have been
by your side all night.

342
00:37:31,912 --> 00:37:35,383
Showing you off.

343
00:37:37,635 --> 00:37:39,373
- Oh, Nina...
- It's just a rash.

344
00:37:39,408 --> 00:37:41,571
Rash?
What are you talking about?

345
00:37:41,606 --> 00:37:43,183
It was worse a few days ago.
It's fine already.

346
00:37:43,218 --> 00:37:45,346
- You've been scratching yourself again.
- No I haven't.

347
00:37:45,381 --> 00:37:47,299
Mom!

348
00:37:47,334 --> 00:37:48,775
This disgusting habit...

349
00:37:50,443 --> 00:37:52,225
Jesus Christ, I thought
you were done with this, Nina.

350
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:55,268
Shrugs.
You'll keep wearing the shrugs.

351
00:37:55,303 --> 00:37:56,656
Sit down.
You have the white one,

352
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,716
and the pink one.
And that'll hide it.

353
00:37:58,751 --> 00:38:03,453
And then I'll dig out that expensive
coverup. We still have some.

354
00:38:03,488 --> 00:38:05,427
No one will see it.

355
00:38:05,462 --> 00:38:07,069
Mom, please,

356
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:11,335
It's the role, isn't it?
It's all this pressure.

357
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:13,242
I knew it'd be too much.
I knew it.

358
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:18,514
You're all right.

359
00:38:21,302 --> 00:38:21,884
You'll be all right.

360
00:40:24,902 --> 00:40:26,640
Beth's in the hospital.

361
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:29,699
She had an accident.

362
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:31,401
Oh no!

363
00:40:31,421 --> 00:40:31,875
Beth?

364
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:40,386
What happened?

365
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:44,725
She walked into the street
and got hit by a car.

366
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:47,972
You know what?

367
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:51,723
I'm almost sure
she did it on purpose.

368
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:54,246
How do you know?

369
00:40:54,281 --> 00:40:58,965
Because everything Beth does comes
from within, from some dark impulse.

370
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,878
I guess that's what makes her
so thrilling to watch.

371
00:41:04,224 --> 00:41:05,500
So dangerous.

372
00:41:07,209 --> 00:41:08,932
Even perfect at times.

373
00:41:12,401 --> 00:41:14,250
But also so damned destructive.

374
00:41:16,576 --> 00:41:18,384
Was it right after we saw her?

375
00:41:18,419 --> 00:41:22,298
Wait, wait, wait.
This has nothing to do with you.

376
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:25,444
It's not your problem,
so don't let yourself be distracted.

377
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:28,671
This is your moment, Nina.

378
00:41:28,706 --> 00:41:31,053
Don't let it go.

379
00:43:01,244 --> 00:43:01,886
What are you doing?

380
00:44:43,776 --> 00:44:44,363
Nina?

381
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:48,120
Sweetie, are you ready for me?

382
00:44:58,471 --> 00:45:01,696
And...
Come on!

383
00:45:01,731 --> 00:45:04,225
Forget about control, Nina.
I want to see passion.

384
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,055
Come on.

385
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,094
Stiff like a dead corpse.
Let it go.

386
00:45:12,129 --> 00:45:14,391
Let it go.
Let it go.

387
00:45:14,426 --> 00:45:16,835
And again.

388
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:19,847
Feels like you have your diaphragm

389
00:45:19,882 --> 00:45:22,599
is in a bit of a contraction?

390
00:45:22,634 --> 00:45:23,757
I'm okay.

391
00:45:28,211 --> 00:45:31,456
Breathe in to this hand.
Breathe in to this hand.

392
00:45:31,491 --> 00:45:33,556
Breathe in, all the way.
Good.

393
00:45:33,591 --> 00:45:36,265
And exhale.

394
00:45:39,766 --> 00:45:41,997
Does it feel jammed in the front
every time you <i>plie</i>?

395
00:45:42,032 --> 00:45:43,801
Sometimes, not always.

396
00:45:48,042 --> 00:45:48,953
- One more pull, okay?
- Okay.

397
00:45:54,859 --> 00:45:55,429
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

398
00:46:16,201 --> 00:46:18,113
David,
can I ask you a question?

399
00:46:18,148 --> 00:46:20,360
Honestly,
would you fuck that girl?

400
00:46:23,637 --> 00:46:24,237
No.

401
00:46:24,272 --> 00:46:25,799
No one would.

402
00:46:27,324 --> 00:46:27,985
Nina...

403
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,206
Your dancing is just as frigid...

404
00:46:31,241 --> 00:46:33,624
Fuck!

405
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:40,587
We're still working here, please.
Lights!

406
00:46:40,622 --> 00:46:42,036
The lights!

407
00:46:43,513 --> 00:46:44,140
Thank you!

408
00:46:44,175 --> 00:46:47,775
Okay, guys, you can go.
Thanks for your patience.

409
00:46:49,531 --> 00:46:50,708
No, no, you stay.
You stay.

410
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:54,304
Have fun, you two.

411
00:46:58,238 --> 00:46:58,668
Okay.

412
00:46:58,703 --> 00:46:59,978
Come here.

413
00:47:00,013 --> 00:47:01,020
Come, come, come, come.

414
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,051
I'll be the Prince.

415
00:47:26,075 --> 00:47:27,143
Let it go. Let it go.

416
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,835
Feel my touch.

417
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,010
Respond to it.

418
00:47:51,045 --> 00:47:52,298
Come on.

419
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,790
Open your mouth.
Open it. Open up.

420
00:48:34,526 --> 00:48:35,733
That was me seducing you,

421
00:48:35,768 --> 00:48:38,459
when it needs to be
the other way around.

422
00:48:38,494 --> 00:48:39,606
Please...

423
00:49:03,837 --> 00:49:04,507
Who is that?

424
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:06,072
Hey.

425
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:09,530
You okay?

426
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:13,201
You can't smoke in here.

427
00:49:13,236 --> 00:49:16,821
Well, I won't tell if you won't.

428
00:49:20,343 --> 00:49:21,199
So...

429
00:49:21,234 --> 00:49:24,069
The big day's getting closer
and closer, huh?

430
00:49:26,353 --> 00:49:29,614
Well, I can't wait.
I think you're going to be amazing.

431
00:49:31,762 --> 00:49:32,120
Thanks.

432
00:49:47,633 --> 00:49:48,365
So...

433
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,007
Do  you want to talk about it?

434
00:49:53,561 --> 00:49:55,814
It's that hard to.

435
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,106
Leroy playing
a little too rough for you?

436
00:50:00,538 --> 00:50:01,848
Come on, Nina.
He's a prick.

437
00:50:01,883 --> 00:50:03,912
He's brilliant.

438
00:50:03,947 --> 00:50:07,331
Sure, but it's not like
he's all warm and fuzzy.

439
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:10,273
What you don't know is...

440
00:50:13,392 --> 00:50:15,394
Someone's hot for teacher!

441
00:50:17,787 --> 00:50:19,515
Oh, come on, it's okay.
I don't blame you.

442
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,938
I should go home.

443
00:50:20,973 --> 00:50:23,690
Nina, come on.
I'm just playing around.

444
00:50:23,725 --> 00:50:26,274
Nina!

445
00:51:47,139 --> 00:51:50,403
Sweetie?
What are you doing in there?

446
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:19,179
Again.

447
00:52:52,488 --> 00:52:53,486
Again.

448
00:53:05,344 --> 00:53:07,059
Do you have any corrections?

449
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:14,222
Lily told me that
she saw you crying.

450
00:53:16,183 --> 00:53:17,722
That you were very upset

451
00:53:17,757 --> 00:53:19,660
and that I should
take it easy on you.

452
00:53:19,695 --> 00:53:21,213
I didn't tell her that.

453
00:53:21,248 --> 00:53:23,650
Maybe you need a little break.

454
00:53:23,685 --> 00:53:26,555
A day or two. Or maybe a month.
What do you think?

455
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:27,771
She shouldn't have said anything.

456
00:53:27,806 --> 00:53:29,930
No, you shouldn't be
whining in the first place.

457
00:53:29,965 --> 00:53:30,714
I didn't.

458
00:53:34,418 --> 00:53:35,561
You could be brilliant.

459
00:53:35,596 --> 00:53:37,499
But you're a coward.

460
00:53:37,534 --> 00:53:39,836
Sorry.

461
00:53:39,871 --> 00:53:42,333
No, stop saying that!
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

462
00:53:42,368 --> 00:53:43,885
Stop being so fucking weak.

463
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,315
Again!

464
00:53:58,743 --> 00:53:59,174
Lily...

465
00:53:59,209 --> 00:54:02,288
Oh, look who's decided
to grace us with her presence.

466
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:03,251
I need to talk to you.

467
00:54:03,286 --> 00:54:04,202
Okay.

468
00:54:04,237 --> 00:54:05,696
Now.

469
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:07,562
Shut up.

470
00:54:07,597 --> 00:54:08,813
Come on.

471
00:54:12,948 --> 00:54:13,391
What's up?

472
00:54:13,426 --> 00:54:16,038
You told Thomas about last night?

473
00:54:17,732 --> 00:54:20,630
Oh, yeah. I ran into him in the morning and
he said you guys were having some trouble.

474
00:54:20,665 --> 00:54:21,755
Why would he talk to you?

475
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:24,450
Oh, excuse me, your highness.

476
00:54:24,485 --> 00:54:28,340
I just told him you're working your ass off
and I think you'll be great.

477
00:54:28,375 --> 00:54:29,274
Well you shouldn't have.

478
00:54:33,673 --> 00:54:34,149
Okay.

479
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:08,583
Has he tried anything with you?

480
00:55:13,112 --> 00:55:14,763
He has a reputation.

481
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:21,932
I have a right to be concerned, Nina.
You've been staying late so many nights.

482
00:55:21,967 --> 00:55:26,091
Rehearsing. I just hope
he isn't taking advantage, that's all.

483
00:55:26,126 --> 00:55:27,531
He's not.

484
00:55:27,566 --> 00:55:29,181
Good.

485
00:55:32,024 --> 00:55:33,837
I just don't want you to make
the same mistake I did.

486
00:55:35,567 --> 00:55:35,963
Thanks.

487
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:38,170
Not like that.

488
00:55:39,493 --> 00:55:41,533
I just mean as far as
my career was concerned.

489
00:55:41,568 --> 00:55:42,472
What career?

490
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,185
The one I gave up to have you.

491
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:51,539
I'm twenty-eight.

492
00:55:51,574 --> 00:55:52,965
So?

493
00:55:53,643 --> 00:55:54,829
Only that...

494
00:55:56,968 --> 00:55:57,888
Only what?

495
00:55:57,923 --> 00:55:59,552
Nothing.

496
00:55:59,587 --> 00:56:00,821
- What?
- Nothing.

497
00:56:04,576 --> 00:56:05,549
How is your skin?

498
00:56:05,584 --> 00:56:07,662
Fine.

499
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,343
- Are you leaving it alone?
- Mm-hmm.

500
00:56:12,575 --> 00:56:13,135
Let me see.

501
00:56:18,337 --> 00:56:19,633
- Take off your shirt.
- No.

502
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:33,328
Can I help you?

503
00:56:37,902 --> 00:56:38,688
Who was that?

504
00:56:38,723 --> 00:56:40,272
It was no one.

505
00:56:42,443 --> 00:56:43,053
It was no one.

506
00:56:48,368 --> 00:56:48,867
Hello?

507
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:54,385
What are you doing here?

508
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,373
I just came by to apologize.

509
00:56:56,408 --> 00:56:58,607
You're right. I should have never
spoken to him about you.

510
00:56:58,642 --> 00:57:00,820
- Sweetheart.
- Give me a second.

511
00:57:00,855 --> 00:57:02,515
- Your dinner...
- Mom, please.

512
00:57:04,803 --> 00:57:06,079
Oh, she's a trip.

513
00:57:06,095 --> 00:57:07,481
How do you know where I live?

514
00:57:08,924 --> 00:57:10,011
I have my ways.

515
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,429
Jesus, relax.
I got it from Susie in the office.

516
00:57:15,752 --> 00:57:19,007
Look, I feel really shitty about what I did,
and I really want to make it up to you.

517
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,285
So how about I take you out to dinner?

518
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:24,814
- I don't think...
- Okay, that's fine.

519
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:27,069
What about drinks?

520
00:57:27,104 --> 00:57:28,744
Sweetie, you need to rest.

521
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,980
- Jesus.
- Wait.

522
00:57:32,826 --> 00:57:33,657
What are you doing?

523
00:57:35,033 --> 00:57:35,830
I'm going out.

524
00:57:35,865 --> 00:57:37,404
What?
Nina!

525
00:57:37,439 --> 00:57:40,108
You're on the stage tomorrow.

526
00:57:41,843 --> 00:57:43,332
I can't believe he calls her that.

527
00:57:43,367 --> 00:57:45,956
- It's so gross.
- I think it's sweet.

528
00:57:45,991 --> 00:57:47,810
Little Princess?

529
00:57:47,845 --> 00:57:50,284
- He probably calls every girl that.
- No way.

530
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:52,301
That's just for Beth.

531
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:56,947
Well, I bet he'll be calling you
Little Princess any day now.

532
00:57:56,982 --> 00:57:58,497
I don't know about that.

533
00:57:58,532 --> 00:58:01,765
Oh, sure he will.
Just got to let him lick your pussy.

534
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:05,566
Cheeseburger, extra bloody.

535
00:58:05,601 --> 00:58:07,408
Mmm, <i>dankeschön</i>.

536
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:10,703
Let me know
if that's juicy enough for you.

537
00:58:10,738 --> 00:58:12,546
Oh, I will.

538
00:58:14,558 --> 00:58:16,304
You have enough cheese?

539
00:58:16,339 --> 00:58:18,717
No, but you do.

540
00:58:21,396 --> 00:58:22,109
Enjoy.

541
00:58:31,993 --> 00:58:32,656
All right.

542
00:58:39,544 --> 00:58:40,856
Wanna spruce up?

543
00:58:40,891 --> 00:58:43,999
What, I carry a spare

544
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:47,263
in case I wake up
somewhere unexpected.

545
00:58:51,276 --> 00:58:52,680
So how is he?

546
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,454
Thomas.

547
00:58:58,323 --> 00:58:59,449
I wouldn't know.

548
00:58:59,484 --> 00:59:02,868
- Oh, come on.
- I really don't want to talk about that.

549
00:59:04,979 --> 00:59:05,760
Okay.

550
00:59:07,602 --> 00:59:10,518
You really need to relax.

551
00:59:17,928 --> 00:59:19,001
One for you,

552
00:59:19,036 --> 00:59:20,998
one for me.

553
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:26,208
Oh, and don't worry. It's pure, I promise.
I brought it with me straight from San Francisco.

554
00:59:28,919 --> 00:59:29,609
What is it?

555
00:59:29,644 --> 00:59:31,698
Are you kidding?

556
00:59:33,405 --> 00:59:34,933
You've never rolled?

557
00:59:37,257 --> 00:59:40,518
Oh, relax. Here.
It'll loosen you up.

558
00:59:42,397 --> 00:59:44,514
Wait till you see the night sky.

559
00:59:48,445 --> 00:59:49,696
How long does it last?

560
00:59:49,731 --> 00:59:52,218
A couple hours, tops.

561
00:59:57,195 --> 00:59:58,470
It's okay.

562
00:59:58,505 --> 01:00:01,132
Okay.

563
01:01:03,354 --> 01:01:04,611
Nina, hi!

564
01:01:04,646 --> 01:01:11,169
I thought we could use some company.
So this is Tom and this is Jerry.

565
01:01:11,204 --> 01:01:14,866
- Actually it's Andrew.
- Tom.

566
01:01:14,901 --> 01:01:18,564
- I have to go...
- Oh, no you can't go. I just got us some drinks.

567
01:01:19,775 --> 01:01:20,887
I shouldn't...

568
01:01:20,922 --> 01:01:22,702
We're on the stage tomorrow.

569
01:01:22,737 --> 01:01:24,831
So what are you going to do?
Go home to Mommy?

570
01:01:28,982 --> 01:01:30,202
Come on, live a little.

571
01:01:35,077 --> 01:01:36,262
It's just a couple hours, right?

572
01:01:37,596 --> 01:01:38,706
Tops.

573
01:01:43,042 --> 01:01:43,646
Cheers.

574
01:01:45,936 --> 01:01:47,233
You haven't told me who you are.

575
01:01:48,226 --> 01:01:49,617
I'm a dancer.

576
01:01:49,652 --> 01:01:51,198
No, I mean your name.

577
01:01:52,835 --> 01:01:54,214
- Oh. Nina.
- So are you two sisters?

578
01:01:54,238 --> 01:01:55,165
- Yes.
- No.

579
01:01:55,182 --> 01:01:59,508
- Blood sisters.
- We dance in the same company.

580
01:01:59,543 --> 01:02:03,254
Ah, ballerinas.
No wonder you two look alike.

581
01:02:03,289 --> 01:02:06,246
I see now.
Tom and Jerry here are gay lovers.

582
01:02:06,281 --> 01:02:08,236
- Very funny.
- I like to amuse myself.

583
01:02:08,271 --> 01:02:09,722
I've never been to the ballet.

584
01:02:09,757 --> 01:02:12,666
Then you are definitely not gay.

585
01:02:12,701 --> 01:02:14,610
I mean, it's kind of boring,
isn't it?

586
01:02:14,645 --> 01:02:15,762
- Be honest.
- No it's not.

587
01:02:15,797 --> 01:02:18,799
You know what?
It's just not for everyone.

588
01:02:18,834 --> 01:02:21,712
You should come sometime.
I can comp you tickets whenever you want.

589
01:02:21,747 --> 01:02:23,156
Yeah. Yeah.

590
01:02:24,018 --> 01:02:25,707
- Yeah, that would be neat. Thanks.
- Okay well...

591
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,692
I think it's time for another round.

592
01:02:29,314 --> 01:02:31,189
Bottoms up.

593
01:02:35,648 --> 01:02:37,186
So what are you guys
working on now?

594
01:02:38,952 --> 01:02:41,318
Sorry.

595
01:02:43,255 --> 01:02:45,147
<i>Swan Lake</i>.

596
01:02:45,182 --> 01:02:46,444
Yeah?

597
01:02:46,479 --> 01:02:48,131
You know it?

598
01:02:48,150 --> 01:02:50,028
No, not really.

599
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,070
Heard of it.

600
01:02:51,105 --> 01:02:52,500
What's it about?

601
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:56,102
It's about a girl who gets
turned into a swan,

602
01:02:56,137 --> 01:02:58,708
and she needs love
to break the spell.

603
01:03:01,035 --> 01:03:03,395
But her prince falls for the wrong girl,

604
01:03:06,176 --> 01:03:07,435
and so she kills herself.

605
01:03:07,470 --> 01:03:10,672
It's not a happy ending then.

606
01:03:10,707 --> 01:03:13,843
It's beautiful, actually.

607
01:03:17,136 --> 01:03:18,090
Like you.

608
01:03:19,222 --> 01:03:20,173
Huh?

609
01:03:21,409 --> 01:03:22,437
I said you're beautiful.

610
01:03:26,464 --> 01:03:27,257
That's funny?

611
01:03:37,596 --> 01:03:39,570
Looks like someone might be rolling.

612
01:03:39,605 --> 01:03:42,884
All right, come on.
Come on, it's time to go dance.

613
01:04:05,534 --> 01:04:06,345
Nina!

614
01:04:42,958 --> 01:04:45,459
Hey, what the fuck?
Where you going?

615
01:05:08,568 --> 01:05:09,051
Nina!

616
01:05:10,456 --> 01:05:11,326
Where are you going?

617
01:06:35,105 --> 01:06:37,386
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

618
01:06:37,421 --> 01:06:39,278
Late?

619
01:06:42,073 --> 01:06:43,330
Where have you been?

620
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:46,312
To the moon and back.

621
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,754
- You've been drinking.
- Ding ding ding ding ding!

622
01:06:50,778 --> 01:06:52,492
- What else?
- Hmm?

623
01:06:52,504 --> 01:06:55,052
What else have you been doing?

624
01:06:56,738 --> 01:06:58,658
Oh, you want to know their names?

625
01:07:00,849 --> 01:07:04,548
- You need to sleep this off.
- There were two. Tom and Jerry.

626
01:07:04,571 --> 01:07:06,990
- Be quiet, Nina.
- And I fucked them both.

627
01:07:07,013 --> 01:07:09,079
Shut your mouth!

628
01:07:22,032 --> 01:07:23,210
- Don't come in here.
- What's this?

629
01:07:23,245 --> 01:07:26,615
It's called privacy.
I'm not twelve anymore.

630
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:29,197
- You're not my Nina right now...
- Leave me alone!

631
01:09:26,598 --> 01:09:28,066
Winged girl.

632
01:10:25,208 --> 01:10:26,489
Why didn't you wake me up?

633
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,236
I'm moving out.

634
01:10:34,973 --> 01:10:35,728
My music!

635
01:10:53,603 --> 01:10:55,021
Thomas, I am so sorry.

636
01:10:55,056 --> 01:10:56,935
Keep on going.

637
01:10:58,521 --> 01:10:59,585
Go get warmed up.

638
01:11:42,265 --> 01:11:42,822
That was good.

639
01:11:45,442 --> 01:11:46,311
Actually, really good.

640
01:11:46,346 --> 01:11:48,518
Okay, let's take ten.

641
01:11:56,751 --> 01:11:59,108
Look, he just wanted to mark it
and asked me to step up, okay?

642
01:12:00,027 --> 01:12:01,242
I overslept.

643
01:12:02,194 --> 01:12:04,943
Oops. But hey, at least
you had a good time, right?

644
01:12:04,978 --> 01:12:06,618
You put something in my drink.

645
01:12:06,653 --> 01:12:08,448
Yeah.

646
01:12:08,483 --> 01:12:10,150
And then you just
took off in the morning.

647
01:12:11,608 --> 01:12:12,333
In the morning?

648
01:12:12,368 --> 01:12:14,302
Yeah, you slept over.

649
01:12:16,863 --> 01:12:17,725
Um, no.

650
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:22,118
Unless your name's Tom
and you had a dick.

651
01:12:24,718 --> 01:12:25,747
What, Nina?

652
01:12:31,473 --> 01:12:34,799
Did you have some sort of
lesbian wet dream about me?

653
01:12:34,834 --> 01:12:37,236
- Stop.
- Oh my God!

654
01:12:37,271 --> 01:12:40,579
Oh my God, you did!
You fantasized about me!

655
01:12:40,599 --> 01:12:43,026
- Shut up!
- Was I good?

656
01:14:26,249 --> 01:14:28,468
The final act.

657
01:14:28,474 --> 01:14:30,458
You're trying to dance.

658
01:14:32,847 --> 01:14:36,086
You've tasted your dream!
Touched it!

659
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:40,447
Only to have it crushed!

660
01:14:43,797 --> 01:14:45,535
Your heart is broken,

661
01:14:45,570 --> 01:14:48,895
wounded.
Your life force fading.

662
01:14:48,930 --> 01:14:52,614
The blood drips.

663
01:14:54,618 --> 01:14:58,870
The Black Swan stole your love.
There is only one way to end the pain.

664
01:15:01,007 --> 01:15:04,504
You are not fearful,
but filled with acceptance.

665
01:15:06,757 --> 01:15:09,768
And you look down at Rothbart,

666
01:15:09,769 --> 01:15:10,888
and then at the Prince,

667
01:15:12,953 --> 01:15:16,004
and then, yes,
at the audience.

668
01:15:16,039 --> 01:15:19,129
And then you jump.

669
01:15:22,722 --> 01:15:24,784
Go ahead. Jump.
Jump!

670
01:15:36,045 --> 01:15:39,152
Okay, everybody get a drink of water,
then it's notes.

671
01:15:51,356 --> 01:15:52,550
You lost weight.

672
01:15:52,585 --> 01:15:54,192
Take off your shrug, please.

673
01:16:05,934 --> 01:16:06,691
Very good.

674
01:16:13,462 --> 01:16:14,946
Face front.
We're almost done.

675
01:16:19,206 --> 01:16:21,228
And that's it.
Okay.

676
01:16:21,263 --> 01:16:23,359
We're done.
Thank you very much.

677
01:16:26,111 --> 01:16:28,767
Georgina, I'm Lily.
Thomas sent me...

678
01:16:28,802 --> 01:16:31,607
Yes, we have to get you measured
for the Swan Queen costumes.

679
01:16:31,642 --> 01:16:32,768
What's she doing here?

680
01:16:34,929 --> 01:16:36,331
He made me your alternate.

681
01:16:38,449 --> 01:16:39,483
Look, it's just in case.

682
01:16:42,124 --> 01:16:44,602
Thomas.
Thomas.

683
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:45,733
- Thomas.
- Yes?

684
01:16:45,768 --> 01:16:47,886
It can't be her.

685
01:16:47,921 --> 01:16:49,784
It can't be her.

686
01:16:49,819 --> 01:16:51,300
Okay, why don't you just go.
I'll catch up later.

687
01:16:51,335 --> 01:16:53,084
What's going on?

688
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:56,151
Lily...
You made her my alternate?

689
01:16:57,693 --> 01:17:00,448
There's always an alternate.
Lily is the best choice.

690
01:17:00,483 --> 01:17:01,882
No, she wants my role.

691
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:04,255
Every dancer in the world
wants your role.

692
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:06,787
No, this is different.
She is after me.

693
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:10,239
- She is trying to replace me.
- Nobody is after you.

694
01:17:10,274 --> 01:17:13,116
- No, please believe me...

695
01:17:15,671 --> 01:17:20,989
I know it's been a struggle.
But you just had a breakthrough this morning.

696
01:17:22,758 --> 01:17:27,390
Tomorrow is yours. Just give a great performance
and you won't have to worry about Lily or anybody else.

697
01:17:31,013 --> 01:17:32,022
Now go home and rest.

698
01:17:45,821 --> 01:17:47,745
From the vision again.

699
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:05,877
What happened?

700
01:18:07,988 --> 01:18:11,971
I've got a life. I work too hard.
It's a big day tomorrow.

701
01:18:56,769 --> 01:18:58,055
I'm still working in here.

702
01:19:08,576 --> 01:19:10,064
Could you please
turn the lights back on?

703
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:16,668
Hello?

704
01:21:04,999 --> 01:21:06,083
What are you doing here?

705
01:21:06,118 --> 01:21:08,025
I'm so sorry.

706
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:10,358
I'm so sorry.

707
01:21:10,393 --> 01:21:14,971
I know how it feels now.
She's trying to replace me.

708
01:21:16,215 --> 01:21:17,589
What do I do?

709
01:21:19,648 --> 01:21:22,025
You stole my things?

710
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:24,699
I was just trying to be perfect, like you.

711
01:21:27,554 --> 01:21:28,294
Perfect?

712
01:21:34,206 --> 01:21:35,437
I'm not perfect.

713
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:38,945
I'm nothing.

714
01:21:41,901 --> 01:21:44,505
Nothing!

715
01:21:53,417 --> 01:21:54,712
Nothing, nothing!

716
01:22:41,771 --> 01:22:42,650
Sweet girl.

717
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:04,557
Mommy?

718
01:23:09,938 --> 01:23:11,280
Sweet girl.
Sweet girl.

719
01:23:15,202 --> 01:23:17,434
Stop!

720
01:23:26,223 --> 01:23:27,101
What are you doing?

721
01:23:29,893 --> 01:23:30,506
Sweetie?

722
01:23:37,772 --> 01:23:38,982
Nina?

723
01:23:39,017 --> 01:23:40,769
Nina!

724
01:23:40,804 --> 01:23:42,072
Go away!

725
01:23:43,571 --> 01:23:44,523
Open the door!

726
01:23:44,558 --> 01:23:45,755
Go away!

727
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:56,335
Open the door, Nina!

728
01:23:57,075 --> 01:23:58,472
Nina!

729
01:24:11,214 --> 01:24:11,783
Get out!

730
01:24:11,818 --> 01:24:14,060
- What's wrong with you?
- Get out!

731
01:24:14,095 --> 01:24:16,099
- Get out!
- What do you see?

732
01:24:16,134 --> 01:24:17,805
Get out!

733
01:24:56,582 --> 01:24:57,716
It's okay.

734
01:24:58,976 --> 01:24:59,820
I'm here.

735
01:25:03,891 --> 01:25:06,306
You were scratching all night.

736
01:25:06,341 --> 01:25:08,607
Where's my clock?

737
01:25:08,642 --> 01:25:10,933
- Don't worry about that.
- What time is it?

738
01:25:11,913 --> 01:25:14,214
- The show is tonight, I have to...
- No, no, no, no.

739
01:25:14,226 --> 01:25:15,511
Don't worry.

740
01:25:15,546 --> 01:25:18,527
I called the theater and I told them
you aren't feeling well.

741
01:25:18,562 --> 01:25:19,663
I have to go!

742
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:21,259
- No. No, you don't.
- Let go of me.

743
01:25:24,245 --> 01:25:25,993
You're staying in here
until you feel better.

744
01:25:26,028 --> 01:25:27,512
Where is it?

745
01:25:29,212 --> 01:25:30,929
This role is destroying you.

746
01:25:32,619 --> 01:25:34,219
- Move. Move!
- Nina...!

747
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:37,672
- What happened to my sweet girl?
- She's gone!

748
01:25:38,405 --> 01:25:40,683
Nina!
Oh, Nina!

749
01:25:41,637 --> 01:25:42,429
No, please!

750
01:25:42,464 --> 01:25:44,596
- You're not well!
- Let go of me!

751
01:25:44,631 --> 01:25:46,300
You can't handle this.

752
01:25:46,335 --> 01:25:48,165
I can't?

753
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:51,245
I'm the Swan Queen.
You're the one who never left the corps.

754
01:25:52,818 --> 01:25:53,576
Nina!

755
01:26:10,048 --> 01:26:10,842
What are you doing here?

756
01:26:10,877 --> 01:26:12,108
Nina?

757
01:26:12,143 --> 01:26:14,051
She was supposed to be sick.

758
01:26:14,086 --> 01:26:15,736
Give us a minute.

759
01:26:21,132 --> 01:26:21,680
Are you okay?

760
01:26:21,715 --> 01:26:23,147
I'm fine.

761
01:26:26,443 --> 01:26:28,426
Nina.

762
01:26:30,211 --> 01:26:31,458
Nina.

763
01:26:31,493 --> 01:26:32,560
What?

764
01:26:32,595 --> 01:26:35,277
I've already asked Lily.

765
01:26:35,312 --> 01:26:37,256
Have you announced it?

766
01:26:41,051 --> 01:26:43,339
After Beth, do you really need
another controversy?

767
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,407
I'm here, Thomas.

768
01:26:49,442 --> 01:26:50,916
I'm doing it.

769
01:26:57,119 --> 01:26:59,515
The only person
standing in your way is you.

770
01:26:59,550 --> 01:27:04,203
It's time to let it go.
Lose yourself.

771
01:27:19,356 --> 01:27:20,953
White Swan, up in ten.

772
01:28:14,913 --> 01:28:16,636
What are you doing?
You need to be upstage.

773
01:30:17,974 --> 01:30:18,874
You suck.

774
01:30:20,477 --> 01:30:21,894
Okay, Nina.

775
01:31:01,009 --> 01:31:01,713
What the fuck?

776
01:31:46,912 --> 01:31:48,802
- Are you okay?
- Nina, are you okay?

777
01:31:58,346 --> 01:31:59,645
Can you tell me
what the fuck happened?

778
01:32:03,403 --> 01:32:05,239
- It wasn't my fault. He dropped me.
- This is a fucking disaster.

779
01:32:13,513 --> 01:32:17,024
Rough start, huh?
Must have been pretty humiliating.

780
01:32:18,893 --> 01:32:20,101
Get out of my room.

781
01:32:20,136 --> 01:32:22,554
I'm worried about the next act.

782
01:32:24,452 --> 01:32:26,312
I'm just not sure you're feeling up to it.

783
01:32:26,347 --> 01:32:27,847
Stop.
Please stop.

784
01:32:27,882 --> 01:32:33,134
How about I dance the Black Swan for you?

785
01:32:35,421 --> 01:32:37,897
Leave me alone!

786
01:32:49,872 --> 01:32:50,499
My turn!

787
01:32:51,463 --> 01:32:52,119
My turn!

788
01:32:52,154 --> 01:32:53,904
My turn!

789
01:33:01,037 --> 01:33:02,713
It's my turn!

790
01:33:22,371 --> 01:33:23,794
Black Swan, places in five.

791
01:36:26,669 --> 01:36:28,542
Come on.

792
01:36:56,245 --> 01:36:58,062
Good job.
Fifteen to the last act.

793
01:37:43,894 --> 01:37:46,911
Hey.
You were amazing.

794
01:37:46,946 --> 01:37:50,669
Seriously, I know that things got
a little messed up between us,

795
01:37:50,704 --> 01:37:54,107
but I mean, holy shit,
you completely blew me away!

796
01:37:56,806 --> 01:37:58,744
Okay, well I guess that's it.

797
01:37:58,779 --> 01:38:00,517
So I'll let you finish.
Bye.

798
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:26,298
Can you hear them?

799
01:41:26,333 --> 01:41:29,038
They love you!

800
01:41:29,073 --> 01:41:32,765
My little princess,
I always knew you had it in you.

801
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,420
Come on.
Let's take you out.

802
01:41:41,643 --> 01:41:42,396
Go get some help.

803
01:41:42,431 --> 01:41:43,395
Go get some help!

804
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:44,862
What did you do?

805
01:41:44,897 --> 01:41:46,018
What did you do?

806
01:41:46,053 --> 01:41:50,210
- I felt it.
- What?

807
01:41:50,245 --> 01:41:52,525
I felt perfect.

808
01:41:58,342 --> 01:41:59,540
I was perfect.

809
01:42:11,823 --> 01:42:14,257
Nina! Nina! Nina!

810
01:42:15,774 --> 01:42:20,944
