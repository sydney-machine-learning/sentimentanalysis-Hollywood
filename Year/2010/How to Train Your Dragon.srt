1
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:37,047
This is Berk.

2
00:00:37,184 --> 00:00:41,587
It's twelve days north of hopeless and a
few degrees south of freezing to death.

3
00:00:41,722 --> 00:00:45,488
It's located solidly
on the meridian of misery.

4
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:50,089
My village. In a word, sturdy.

5
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,929
It's been here for seven generations,
but every single building is new.

6
00:00:55,068 --> 00:00:59,164
We have fishing, hunting
and a charming view of the sunsets.

7
00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:02,298
The only problems are the pests.

8
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,746
You see, most places
have mice or mosquitoes.

9
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,041
We have...

10
00:01:11,918 --> 00:01:13,351
...dragons.

11
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:16,989
Most people would leave. Not us.

12
00:01:17,124 --> 00:01:20,719
We're Vikings.
We have stubbornness issues.

13
00:01:22,896 --> 00:01:23,885
My name is Hiccup.

14
00:01:24,831 --> 00:01:27,493
Great name, I know.
But it's not the worst.

15
00:01:27,634 --> 00:01:31,331
Parents believe a hideous name
will frighten off gnomes and trolls.

16
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:33,803
Like our charming Viking demeanor
wouldn't do that.

17
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:35,930
Morning!

18
00:01:38,111 --> 00:01:39,976
- What are you doing here?!
- Get inside!

19
00:01:40,113 --> 00:01:42,911
- What are you doing out?!
- Get back inside!

20
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:50,048
Hiccup! What is he doing?
What are you doing out?! Get inside!

21
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,819
That's Stoick the Vast,
chief of the tribe.

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,829
When he was a baby, he popped
a dragon's head clean off its shoulders.

23
00:01:58,965 --> 00:02:01,092
Do I believe it? Yes, I do.

24
00:02:01,234 --> 00:02:02,258
What have we got?

25
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:06,202
Gronckles. Nadders. Zipplebacks.
Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare.

26
00:02:07,674 --> 00:02:09,801
- Any Night Furies?
- None so far.

27
00:02:09,943 --> 00:02:11,035
Good.

28
00:02:11,178 --> 00:02:13,009
Hoist the torches!

29
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:21,882
Nice of you to join the party!
I thought you'd been carried off!

30
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:26,857
Who, me? No, come on,
I'm way too muscular for their taste.

31
00:02:26,993 --> 00:02:30,224
They wouldn't know
what to do with all this.

32
00:02:30,363 --> 00:02:32,194
They need toothpicks, don't they?

33
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,599
The meathead with attitude
and interchangeable hands is Gobber.

34
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:41,196
I've been his apprentice
since I was little. Well, littler.

35
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:45,375
Move to the lower defenses.
We'll counterattack with the catapults.

36
00:02:45,512 --> 00:02:46,638
Hurry!

37
00:02:47,747 --> 00:02:51,012
See? Old village,
lots and lots of new houses.

38
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:52,577
Fire!

39
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:53,981
Let's go!

40
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:58,751
That's Fishlegs, Snotlout, the twins:
Ruffnut and Tuffnut...

41
00:02:59,292 --> 00:03:00,486
...and...

42
00:03:02,229 --> 00:03:03,719
...Astrid.

43
00:03:13,807 --> 00:03:16,105
Theirjob is so much cooler.

44
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:20,680
Come on. Let me out, please.
I need to make my mark.

45
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:23,749
You've made plenty of marks,
all in the wrong places.

46
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:25,749
Please, two minutes. I'll kill a dragon.

47
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:29,083
My life will get infinitely better.
I might even get a date.

48
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:31,918
You can't lift a hammer.
You can't swing an axe.

49
00:03:32,058 --> 00:03:33,616
You can't even throw one of these!

50
00:03:35,962 --> 00:03:38,954
OK, fine,
but this will throw it for me.

51
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,535
See? Now this right here
is what I'm talking about!

52
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,729
- Mild calibration issue...
- Hiccup!

53
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:48,966
If you ever want to get out there
to fight dragons...

54
00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:52,135
...you need to stop all this.

55
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:54,372
But you just pointed to all of me.

56
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:57,881
Yes, that's it!
Stop being all of you.

57
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:00,079
Oh, yes.

58
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,950
You, sir,
are playing a dangerous game.

59
00:04:03,089 --> 00:04:07,150
Keeping this much
raw Vikingness contained?

60
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:08,955
There will be consequences!

61
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:12,553
I'll take my chances.
Sword. Sharpen. Now.

62
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:18,334
One day, I'll get out there.
Because killing a dragon...

63
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:20,268
...is everything around here.

64
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,977
A Nadder head is sure
to get me at least noticed.

65
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:26,578
Gronckles are tough.

66
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:29,944
Taking down one of those
would definitely get me a girlfriend.

67
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,081
A Zippleback?

68
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:36,088
Exotic. Two heads, twice the status.

69
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:37,519
They found the sheep!

70
00:04:37,657 --> 00:04:39,818
Concentrate fire over the lower bank.

71
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,621
- Hurry up!
- Fire!

72
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:44,989
And then there's
the Monstrous Nightmare.

73
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:48,066
Only the best Vikings go after those.

74
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:52,137
They have this nasty habit
of setting themselves on fire.

75
00:04:54,074 --> 00:04:56,474
Reload! I'll take care of this.

76
00:04:57,911 --> 00:05:02,041
But the ultimate prize
is the dragon no one's ever seen.

77
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:04,173
- We call it the...
- Night Fury!

78
00:05:04,317 --> 00:05:05,682
Get down!

79
00:05:08,655 --> 00:05:10,179
Jump!

80
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:14,721
This thing never steals food,
never shows itself and...

81
00:05:16,196 --> 00:05:17,993
...never misses.

82
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:22,932
No one has ever killed a Night Fury.
That's why I'm going to be the first.

83
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:26,197
Man the fort, Hiccup.
They need me out there.

84
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,571
Stay. Put. There.

85
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:33,740
You know what I mean.

86
00:05:35,215 --> 00:05:37,376
- Where are you going?
- Yeah, I know!

87
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:38,916
- Hiccup!
- Be right back!

88
00:05:44,658 --> 00:05:46,023
Let's get him!

89
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:48,083
Mind yourselves!

90
00:05:48,228 --> 00:05:50,219
The devils still have
some juice in them!

91
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:03,572
Come on. Give me something to
shoot at. Give me something to shoot at.

92
00:06:26,266 --> 00:06:28,928
I hit it. Yes, I hit it!

93
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:31,126
Did anybody see that?

94
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:33,801
Except for you.

95
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:42,180
- Do not let them escape!
- Right!

96
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:02,594
You're all out.

97
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:11,272
Oh, and there's one more thing
you need to know.

98
00:07:21,755 --> 00:07:23,746
Sorry, Dad.

99
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:34,962
OK, but I hit a Night Fury.

100
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:39,596
It's not like the last few times, Dad!
I really, actually hit it!

101
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:42,037
You guys were busy.
I had a very clear shot.

102
00:07:42,175 --> 00:07:45,633
It went down off Raven Point.
Let's get a search party...

103
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:47,107
Stop!

104
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,309
Just stop.

105
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:52,743
Every time you step outside,
disaster follows.

106
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,945
Can you not see that
I have bigger problems?

107
00:07:55,088 --> 00:07:58,683
Winter is almost here
and I have an entire village to feed!

108
00:07:59,826 --> 00:08:03,956
Between you and me, the village
could do with a little less feeding.

109
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:06,031
This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

110
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:09,397
Why can't you follow
the simplest orders?

111
00:08:09,536 --> 00:08:14,166
I can't stop myself. I see a dragon
and I have to just kill it.

112
00:08:14,307 --> 00:08:16,332
It's who I am, Dad.

113
00:08:16,476 --> 00:08:21,709
You're many things, Hiccup.
But a dragon killer is not one of them.

114
00:08:22,048 --> 00:08:23,640
Get back to the house.

115
00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:25,780
Make sure he gets there.

116
00:08:26,186 --> 00:08:28,586
I have his mess to clean up.

117
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:30,850
Quite the performance.

118
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:33,823
I've never seen anyone
mess up that badly. That helped.

119
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,588
Thank you, thank you. I was trying.

120
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:42,067
- I really did hit one.
- Sure, Hiccup.

121
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:44,498
- He never listens.
- It runs in the family.

122
00:08:44,637 --> 00:08:47,435
When he does,
it's with this disappointed scowl,

123
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:50,008
like someone skimped on meat
in his sandwich.

124
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:54,204
"Excuse me, barmaid.
You brought me the wrong offspring.

125
00:08:54,347 --> 00:08:59,148
I ordered an extra-large boy with beefy
arms, extra guts and glory on the side.

126
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:02,049
This here, this is a talking fishbone."

127
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:04,281
You're thinking about this wrong.

128
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:08,861
It's not so much what you look like,
it's what's inside that he can't stand.

129
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:11,430
Thank you for summing that up.

130
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:15,825
Look, the point is, stop trying
so hard to be something you're not.

131
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:18,301
I just want to be one of you guys.

132
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:31,373
Either we finish them
or they'll finish us!

133
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:34,146
It's the only way
we'll be rid of them.

134
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:36,312
If we find the nest and destroy it,

135
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:39,653
the dragons will leave.
They'll find another home!

136
00:09:39,792 --> 00:09:42,317
One more search
before the ice sets in.

137
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:44,453
Those ships never come back.

138
00:09:44,597 --> 00:09:49,125
We're Vikings. It's an occupational
hazard. Now who's with me?!

139
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:50,258
Count me out.

140
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:52,530
- Today's no good for me.
- I have to do my axe returns.

141
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:55,800
All right. Those who stay
will look after Hiccup.

142
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:57,569
- To the ships!
- I'm with you!

143
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,768
That's more like it.

144
00:10:00,847 --> 00:10:02,178
I'll pack my undies.

145
00:10:02,315 --> 00:10:05,250
No, I need you to stay
and train some new recruits.

146
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:09,845
Perfect. And, while I'm busy,
Hiccup can cover the stall.

147
00:10:09,989 --> 00:10:13,186
Molten steel, razor-sharp blades,
lots of time to himself.

148
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:15,317
What could possibly go wrong?

149
00:10:15,461 --> 00:10:17,622
What am I going
to do with him, Gobber?

150
00:10:17,764 --> 00:10:19,129
Put him in training.

151
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:21,529
- No, I'm serious.
- So am I.

152
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:24,535
He'd be killed before
the first dragon is out of its cage.

153
00:10:24,671 --> 00:10:26,263
- You don't know that.
- I do, actually.

154
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:27,896
- No, you don't.
- No, I do.

155
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,269
No, you don't.

156
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:31,206
Listen, you know what he's like.

157
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:35,280
From the time he could crawl,
he's been... different.

158
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:39,950
He doesn't listen. He has
the attention span of a sparrow.

159
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:43,646
I take him fishing
and he goes hunting for trolls!

160
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,350
Trolls exist. They steal your socks.

161
00:10:46,492 --> 00:10:49,518
But only the left ones.
What's with that?

162
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:50,959
- When I was a boy...
- Here we go.

163
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:53,998
...my father told me to bang
my head against a rock and I did it.

164
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:56,966
I thought it was crazy,
but I didn't question him.

165
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:59,298
- And you know what happened?
- You got a headache.

166
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:01,407
That rock split in two.

167
00:11:02,008 --> 00:11:04,670
It taught me what
a Viking could do, Gobber.

168
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:08,804
He could crush mountains,
level forests, tame seas!

169
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:14,014
Even as a boy, I knew what I was,
what I had to become.

170
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:16,722
Hiccup is not that boy.

171
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:19,188
You can't stop him, Stoick.

172
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:21,520
You can only prepare him.

173
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:25,859
I know it seems hopeless, but you won't
always be around to protect him.

174
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:30,128
He's going to get out there again.
He's probably out there now.

175
00:11:48,421 --> 00:11:50,616
Oh, the gods hate me.

176
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:53,954
Some people lose their knife
or their mug. Not me.

177
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:57,085
I manage to lose an entire dragon.

178
00:12:46,312 --> 00:12:48,576
Oh, wow. I did it.

179
00:12:49,048 --> 00:12:52,711
I did it. This fixes everything! Yes!

180
00:12:52,852 --> 00:12:55,184
I have brought down
this mighty beast!

181
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,574
I'm going to kill you, dragon.

182
00:13:26,052 --> 00:13:29,988
Then I'll cut out your heart
and take it to my father.

183
00:13:30,323 --> 00:13:33,451
I am a Viking. I am a Viking!

184
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,594
I did this.

185
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,892
Hiccup.

186
00:15:25,404 --> 00:15:26,803
Dad...

187
00:15:27,406 --> 00:15:29,465
...I have to talk to you, Dad.

188
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:31,804
I need to speak with you, too, son.

189
00:15:33,412 --> 00:15:35,744
- I don't want to fight dragons.
- It's time you learn to fight dragons.

190
00:15:35,881 --> 00:15:36,870
- What?
- What?

191
00:15:37,016 --> 00:15:39,746
- You go first.
- No, you go first.

192
00:15:39,885 --> 00:15:40,943
All right.

193
00:15:41,554 --> 00:15:45,490
You get your wish. Dragon training...
you start in the morning.

194
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:47,684
Oh, man, I should have gone first.

195
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:49,590
I was thinking, you know,

196
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:52,755
we have a surplus
of dragon-fighting Vikings,

197
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:57,562
but do we have enough bread-making
Vikings or small-home-repair Vikings?

198
00:15:57,703 --> 00:15:58,692
You'll need this.

199
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:01,033
I don't want to fight dragons.

200
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,632
Come on. Yes, you do.

201
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:06,711
Rephrase. Dad, I can't kill dragons.

202
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:08,643
But you will kill dragons.

203
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:11,807
No, I'm really very extra-sure
that I won't.

204
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:13,851
- It's time, Hiccup.
- Can you not hear me?

205
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:16,181
This is serious, son.

206
00:16:16,856 --> 00:16:21,623
When you carry this axe,
you carry all of us with you.

207
00:16:21,761 --> 00:16:25,458
Which means you walk like us,
you talk like us...

208
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:27,463
...you think like us.

209
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,826
No more of... this.

210
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:31,937
You just gestured to all of me.

211
00:16:32,338 --> 00:16:35,432
- Deal?
- This conversation is very one-sided.

212
00:16:35,574 --> 00:16:36,871
Deal?

213
00:16:38,744 --> 00:16:39,870
Deal.

214
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,469
Good.

215
00:16:43,883 --> 00:16:45,350
Train hard.

216
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:48,015
I'll be back. Probably.

217
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:50,745
And I'll be here.

218
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,557
Maybe.

219
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:56,019
Welcome to dragon training!

220
00:16:56,962 --> 00:16:58,623
No turning back.

221
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:17,915
I hope I get some serious burns.

222
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,679
I'm hoping for some mauling,
like on my shoulder or back.

223
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:24,085
Yeah, it's only fun if you get
a scar out of it.

224
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:25,485
Yeah, no kidding, right?

225
00:17:25,891 --> 00:17:27,688
Pain. Love it.

226
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:29,556
Oh, great. Who let him in?

227
00:17:29,695 --> 00:17:32,459
Let's get started!
The recruit who does best

228
00:17:32,598 --> 00:17:35,226
will win the honor
of killing his first dragon

229
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:37,097
in front of the entire village.

230
00:17:37,236 --> 00:17:41,798
Hiccup already killed a Night Fury,
so does that disqualify him?

231
00:17:41,941 --> 00:17:44,432
Can I transfer to the class
with the cool Vikings?

232
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:48,604
Don't worry. You're small and weak...
that'll make you less of a target.

233
00:17:48,748 --> 00:17:50,545
They'll see you as sick or insane

234
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:53,880
and go after the more
Viking-like teens instead.

235
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:57,614
Behind these doors
are just a few of the many species

236
00:17:57,757 --> 00:17:58,746
you will learn to fight!

237
00:17:58,891 --> 00:18:01,416
- The Deadly Nadder!
- Speed 8, armor 16.

238
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,925
The Hideous Zippleback.

239
00:18:03,062 --> 00:18:04,461
Plus 11 stealth. Times 2.

240
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:06,622
- The Monstrous Nightmare.
- Firepower 15.

241
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:08,825
- The Terrible Terror.
- Attack 8, venom 12.

242
00:18:08,968 --> 00:18:10,697
Can you stop that?!

243
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:13,737
And the Gronckle.

244
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:15,966
Jaw strength 8.

245
00:18:16,108 --> 00:18:17,632
Wait, aren't you gonna teach us first?

246
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:20,302
I believe in learning on the job.

247
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:25,107
Today is about survival.
If you get blasted...

248
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:27,442
...you're dead!

249
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:29,247
What's the first thing you'll need?

250
00:18:29,388 --> 00:18:31,117
- A doctor?
- Plus 5 speed?

251
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:33,516
- A shield.
- Shields. Go!

252
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:36,991
Your most important piece of equipment
is your shield!

253
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:41,122
If you must choose between
a sword or a shield, take the shield!

254
00:18:41,534 --> 00:18:43,365
- Let go of my shield!
- There are a million shields!

255
00:18:43,502 --> 00:18:45,527
Take that one. It has a flower...
girls like flowers.

256
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:47,865
Oops, this one has blood on it.

257
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:51,977
- Tuffnut, Ruffnut! You're out!
- What?

258
00:18:52,111 --> 00:18:53,806
Shields are good for another thing.

259
00:18:53,946 --> 00:18:58,212
Noise! Make lots of it
to throw off a dragon's aim!

260
00:18:59,552 --> 00:19:02,020
All dragons have
a limited number of shots.

261
00:19:02,154 --> 00:19:04,418
How many does a Gronckle have?

262
00:19:04,557 --> 00:19:05,888
- Five?
- No, six!

263
00:19:06,025 --> 00:19:08,152
Correct, six!
That's one for each of you!

264
00:19:08,761 --> 00:19:10,729
Fishlegs, out!

265
00:19:10,863 --> 00:19:12,888
Hiccup, get in there!

266
00:19:15,501 --> 00:19:19,164
I moved into my parents' basement.
Come by sometime and work out.

267
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:21,005
You look like you work out.

268
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,074
Snotlout! You're done!

269
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:24,836
So it's just you and me, huh?

270
00:19:25,044 --> 00:19:26,636
Nope, just you.

271
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:29,511
One shot left!

272
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:31,908
Hiccup!

273
00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:41,924
And that's six.

274
00:19:42,194 --> 00:19:45,129
Go back to bed,
you overgrown sausage!

275
00:19:47,066 --> 00:19:49,864
You'll get another chance,
don't you worry.

276
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:52,994
Remember, a dragon will always,

277
00:19:53,272 --> 00:19:56,730
always go for the kill.

278
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:05,950
So... why didn't you?

279
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:34,975
This was stupid.

280
00:21:18,257 --> 00:21:21,192
Why don't you just fly away?

281
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:00,057
All right, where did Astrid go wrong
in the ring today?

282
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:02,963
I mistimed my somersault dive.
It was sloppy.

283
00:22:03,102 --> 00:22:05,696
- It threw off my reverse tumble.
- Yeah, we noticed.

284
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:07,897
No, no, you were great.
That was so "Astrid."

285
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,600
She's right. You have to be
tough on yourselves.

286
00:22:10,743 --> 00:22:12,506
Where did Hiccup go wrong?

287
00:22:12,645 --> 00:22:15,170
- He showed up.
- He didn't get eaten.

288
00:22:15,314 --> 00:22:17,077
He's never where he should be.

289
00:22:17,216 --> 00:22:19,116
Thank you, Astrid.

290
00:22:19,385 --> 00:22:23,845
You need to live and breathe
this stuff. The dragon manual.

291
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:28,250
Everything we know about
every dragon we know of.

292
00:22:30,863 --> 00:22:32,854
No attacks tonight. Study up.

293
00:22:32,998 --> 00:22:34,659
Wait, you mean read?

294
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,062
While we're still alive?

295
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:38,169
Why read words
when you can just kill the stuff

296
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:39,998
the words tell you stuff about?

297
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:43,074
I've read it seven times.
There's this water dragon

298
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:46,507
that sprays boiling water at your
face. And there's this other one...

299
00:22:46,945 --> 00:22:48,378
Yeah. That sounds great.

300
00:22:48,514 --> 00:22:51,745
- There was a chance I'd read it...
- But now...

301
00:22:51,884 --> 00:22:53,476
You guys read. I'll go kill stuff.

302
00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:56,821
Another one has spines like trees.

303
00:22:56,955 --> 00:22:59,116
- So I guess we'll share?
- Read it.

304
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:04,090
All mine, then. Wow.
So, OK, I'll see you...

305
00:23:04,396 --> 00:23:05,863
...tomorrow.

306
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:17,874
Dragon classifications.

307
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:21,275
Strike class.
Fear class. Mystery class.

308
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:26,982
Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon
inhabits sea caves and dark tide pools.

309
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,145
When startled, the Thunderdrum
produces a concussive sound

310
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:32,052
that can kill a man at close range.

311
00:23:32,191 --> 00:23:35,160
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

312
00:23:35,294 --> 00:23:39,162
Timberjack. This gigantic creature
has razor-sharp wings

313
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:41,266
that can slice through full-grown trees.

314
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,426
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.

315
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:49,405
Scauldron. Sprays scalding water
at its victim. Extremely dangerous.

316
00:23:55,347 --> 00:23:59,511
Changewing. Even newly hatched
dragons can spray acid. Kill on sight.

317
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:03,345
Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill.

318
00:24:03,822 --> 00:24:06,985
Bone Knapper. Whispering Death.

319
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,194
Burns its victims. Buries its victims.

320
00:24:10,329 --> 00:24:13,264
Chokes its victims.
Turns its victims inside out.

321
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:16,262
Extremely dangerous.
Extremely dangerous.

322
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:20,130
Kill on sight.
Kill on sight. Kill on sight.

323
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,339
Night Fury.

324
00:24:24,009 --> 00:24:27,536
Speed unknown. Size unknown.

325
00:24:28,013 --> 00:24:32,211
The unholy offspring
of lightning and death itself.

326
00:24:32,351 --> 00:24:34,148
Never engage this dragon.

327
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:38,450
Your only chance: Hide and pray
it does not find you.

328
00:24:52,404 --> 00:24:54,372
I can almost smell them.

329
00:24:54,506 --> 00:24:56,133
They're close.

330
00:24:57,209 --> 00:24:58,608
Steady.

331
00:25:09,354 --> 00:25:10,616
Take us in.

332
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:13,553
Hard to port. For Helheim's Gate.

333
00:25:13,892 --> 00:25:15,553
Hard to port!

334
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:21,059
Steady!

335
00:25:33,345 --> 00:25:37,577
Hey, you know, I just happened to notice
the book had nothing on Night Furies.

336
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:42,378
Is there another book, or a sequel?
Maybe a Night Fury pamphlet?

337
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:46,781
Focus, Hiccup!
You're not even trying!

338
00:25:48,527 --> 00:25:51,655
Today it's all about attack!

339
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,564
Nadders are quick and light
on their feet.

340
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,430
Your job is to be quicker and lighter!

341
00:25:59,705 --> 00:26:02,469
I'm really beginning to question
your teaching methods!

342
00:26:02,608 --> 00:26:05,076
Look for its blind spot!
Every dragon has one.

343
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,145
Find it, hide in it and strike!

344
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:11,080
Do you ever bathe?

345
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:13,844
If you don't like it, then
just get your own blind spot.

346
00:26:13,986 --> 00:26:15,954
How about I give you one?

347
00:26:17,623 --> 00:26:20,524
Blind spot, yes.
Deaf spot, not so much.

348
00:26:21,526 --> 00:26:24,427
Hey, so, how would one sneak up
on a Night Fury?

349
00:26:24,563 --> 00:26:28,090
No one's ever met one and lived
to tell the tale. Get in there!

350
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:30,599
- I know, I know, but hypothetically...
- Hiccup!

351
00:26:30,736 --> 00:26:32,067
Get down.

352
00:26:46,218 --> 00:26:48,209
Watch out, babe.
I'll take care of this.

353
00:26:49,388 --> 00:26:52,221
The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.

354
00:26:52,524 --> 00:26:54,389
What do you want me to do,
block out the sun?

355
00:26:54,526 --> 00:26:56,460
I could do that but I don't have time!

356
00:26:56,595 --> 00:26:58,426
They probably...

357
00:26:58,563 --> 00:27:02,397
...take the daytime off, right?
Like a cat.

358
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:04,661
Has anyone ever seen one napping?

359
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:06,263
Hiccup!

360
00:27:07,673 --> 00:27:09,004
Hiccup!

361
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,008
Love on the battlefield.

362
00:27:14,146 --> 00:27:15,238
She could do better.

363
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,007
Let me... Why don't you?

364
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:27,789
Well done, Astrid.

365
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:32,525
Is this some kind of a joke to you?

366
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:35,793
Our parents' war
is about to become ours.

367
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:38,129
Figure out which side you're on.

368
00:28:59,584 --> 00:29:01,449
Toothless.

369
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:03,816
I could have sworn you had...

370
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:08,148
...teeth.

371
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:13,388
No, no, no.

372
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,766
I don't have any more!

373
00:33:13,438 --> 00:33:14,472
And with one twist, he took my hand
and swallowed it whole!

374
00:33:14,472 --> 00:33:17,600
And with one twist, he took my hand
and swallowed it whole!

375
00:33:17,742 --> 00:33:20,905
I saw the look on his face...
I was delicious.

376
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:22,343
He must have passed the word,

377
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,041
because it wasn't a month before
another one of them took my leg.

378
00:33:26,918 --> 00:33:29,910
Isn't it weird to think
your hand was inside a dragon?

379
00:33:30,055 --> 00:33:32,285
Like if your mind was still
in control of it,

380
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:35,985
you could have killed the dragon
from inside by crushing his heart.

381
00:33:36,127 --> 00:33:40,928
I swear, I'm so angry. I'll avenge your
beautiful hand and your beautiful foot.

382
00:33:41,066 --> 00:33:45,059
I'll chop off the legs of every dragon
I fight, with my face.

383
00:33:46,538 --> 00:33:48,768
It's the wings and the tails
you really want.

384
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:51,375
If it can't fly, it can't get away.

385
00:33:51,509 --> 00:33:54,808
A downed dragon is a dead dragon.

386
00:33:57,949 --> 00:34:00,679
All right, I'm off to bed.
You should be, too.

387
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:04,118
Tomorrow we get to the big boys,
slowly but surely

388
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:07,486
making our way up
to the Monstrous Nightmare.

389
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:10,150
But who'll win the honor of killing it?

390
00:34:10,295 --> 00:34:13,560
It's gonna be me. It's my destiny. See?

391
00:34:13,698 --> 00:34:15,825
Your mom let you get a tattoo?

392
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:17,696
It's not a tattoo, it's a birthmark.

393
00:34:17,836 --> 00:34:21,636
OK, I've been stuck with you since
birth, and that was never there before.

394
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:24,571
Yes, it was. You've just never
seen me from the left side.

395
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:07,847
Hey, Toothless.

396
00:35:07,986 --> 00:35:11,786
I brought breakfast. I hope...
I hope you're hungry.

397
00:35:12,924 --> 00:35:14,915
OK, that's disgusting.

398
00:35:15,193 --> 00:35:18,890
We've got some salmon,
some nice Icelandic cod...

399
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:21,191
...and a whole smoked eel.

400
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:29,540
No, no, no, no, no!
No, it's OK.

401
00:35:30,074 --> 00:35:32,269
Yeah, I don't really like
eel much, either.

402
00:35:35,914 --> 00:35:37,211
That's it.

403
00:35:37,949 --> 00:35:40,076
That's it.
Just stick with the good stuff.

404
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:44,215
And don't you mind me.
I'll just be back here,

405
00:35:44,689 --> 00:35:47,214
minding my own business.

406
00:35:59,704 --> 00:36:00,966
It's OK.

407
00:36:11,115 --> 00:36:12,309
OK.

408
00:36:26,731 --> 00:36:28,062
That's not too bad. It works.

409
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:35,596
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

410
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:48,141
Oh, my! It's working!

411
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:56,224
Yes, yes! I did it!

412
00:37:08,506 --> 00:37:09,530
Yeah!

413
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:11,642
Today is about teamwork.

414
00:37:14,212 --> 00:37:17,841
Now, a wet dragon head
can't light its fire.

415
00:37:18,116 --> 00:37:21,984
The Hideous Zippleback
is extra tricky.

416
00:37:22,253 --> 00:37:25,586
One head breathes gas,
the other head lights it.

417
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:29,589
Your job is to know which is which.

418
00:37:29,727 --> 00:37:32,924
Razor-sharp serrated teeth
that inject venom for pre-digestion.

419
00:37:33,064 --> 00:37:35,430
Prefers ambush attack,
crushing its victims...

420
00:37:35,567 --> 00:37:36,864
Will you please stop that?!

421
00:37:41,139 --> 00:37:45,007
If that dragon shows
either of his faces, I'm gonna...

422
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:46,337
There!

423
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:49,872
Hey, it's us, idiots!

424
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:52,744
Your butts are getting bigger.
We thought you were a dragon.

425
00:37:52,951 --> 00:37:56,284
Not that there's anything wrong
with a dragonesque figure.

426
00:38:00,024 --> 00:38:01,013
Wait.

427
00:38:04,028 --> 00:38:06,292
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

428
00:38:06,431 --> 00:38:09,298
Chances of survival are
dwindling to single digits now.

429
00:38:16,908 --> 00:38:18,307
Wrong head.

430
00:38:18,943 --> 00:38:19,932
Fishlegs!

431
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:24,136
Now, Hiccup!

432
00:38:27,151 --> 00:38:29,051
Oh, come on.

433
00:38:33,725 --> 00:38:35,056
Hiccup!

434
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:39,319
Back, back, back!

435
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:44,162
Now, don't you make me tell you again!
Yes, that's right.

436
00:38:44,302 --> 00:38:48,136
Back into your cage.
Now think about what you've done.

437
00:38:58,149 --> 00:39:03,212
OK, so are we done? 'Cause I've got
some things I need to...

438
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:06,085
Yep, I'll see you tomorrow!

439
00:39:58,209 --> 00:40:00,177
I've never seen a Gronckle do that.

440
00:40:00,311 --> 00:40:05,180
I left my axe back in the ring. You guys
go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.

441
00:40:44,956 --> 00:40:47,356
Meet the Terrible Terror.

442
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:50,822
It's like the size of my...

443
00:40:52,196 --> 00:40:53,356
Get it off!

444
00:40:53,931 --> 00:40:56,866
Oh, I'm hurt! I am very much hurt!

445
00:40:59,637 --> 00:41:01,935
Wow! He's better than you ever were.

446
00:41:46,617 --> 00:41:48,175
Oh, great.

447
00:41:49,253 --> 00:41:50,311
Hiccup.

448
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:07,801
Hiccup? Are you in there?

449
00:42:09,574 --> 00:42:10,973
Astrid. Hey.

450
00:42:11,108 --> 00:42:13,702
Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid. Hi, Astrid.

451
00:42:13,845 --> 00:42:16,780
I normally don't care what people do,
but you're acting weird.

452
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:19,644
Well, weirder.

453
00:42:48,312 --> 00:42:52,043
- I trust you found the nest, at least?
- Not even close.

454
00:42:52,183 --> 00:42:53,207
Excellent.

455
00:42:53,351 --> 00:42:55,581
I hope you had more success than me.

456
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,054
Well, if by success, you mean that
your parenting troubles are over, yes.

457
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:03,591
Congratulations, Stoick!
Everyone is so relieved!

458
00:43:03,728 --> 00:43:05,889
Out with the old and
in with the new, right?

459
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:09,397
- No one will miss that nuisance!
- We're throwing a party to celebrate!

460
00:43:09,967 --> 00:43:11,127
- Come over here.
- Hurry!

461
00:43:11,269 --> 00:43:12,258
He's gone?

462
00:43:14,472 --> 00:43:18,408
Most afternoons, but who can blame
him? The life of a celebrity's rough.

463
00:43:18,542 --> 00:43:22,376
He can barely walk through the village
without being swarmed by his new fans.

464
00:43:22,513 --> 00:43:23,502
Hiccup?

465
00:43:23,648 --> 00:43:27,744
Who would have thought it?
He has this way with the beasts.

466
00:43:35,993 --> 00:43:39,622
OK, bud.
We're gonna take this nice and slow.

467
00:43:39,764 --> 00:43:41,527
Here we go. Here we go. Position...

468
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:44,190
...three... no, four.

469
00:44:03,454 --> 00:44:06,082
All right, it's go time. It's go time.

470
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:14,096
Come on, buddy! Come on, buddy!

471
00:44:22,106 --> 00:44:23,698
Yes, it worked!

472
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:29,641
Sorry!

473
00:44:32,116 --> 00:44:33,310
It was my fault.

474
00:44:34,518 --> 00:44:36,645
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. Position four.

475
00:44:37,154 --> 00:44:38,143
Three.

476
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:43,383
Yeah! Go, baby!

477
00:44:44,128 --> 00:44:45,152
Yes!

478
00:44:45,296 --> 00:44:49,494
Oh, this is amazing!
The wind in my... cheat sheet!

479
00:44:49,633 --> 00:44:51,123
Stop!

480
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:55,135
No!

481
00:44:58,242 --> 00:45:01,609
Oh, gosh! Oh, gods! Oh, no!

482
00:45:02,013 --> 00:45:05,176
All right, OK, you've gotta
kind of angle yourself.

483
00:45:05,316 --> 00:45:08,114
OK, no, no, no. Come back down
towards me! Come back down...

484
00:45:49,927 --> 00:45:51,554
Yeah!

485
00:45:53,397 --> 00:45:54,489
Come on.

486
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:05,475
No, thanks. I'm good.

487
00:46:42,513 --> 00:46:45,641
Not so fireproof
on the inside, are you?

488
00:46:45,783 --> 00:46:46,909
Here you go.

489
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:07,597
Everything we know
about you guys is wrong.

490
00:47:17,815 --> 00:47:20,807
Dad! You're back!
Gobber's not here so...

491
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:21,940
I know.

492
00:47:24,555 --> 00:47:27,422
- I came looking for you.
- You did?

493
00:47:27,558 --> 00:47:29,025
You've been keeping secrets.

494
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,793
I have?

495
00:47:30,928 --> 00:47:33,556
Just how long did you think
you could hide it?

496
00:47:33,697 --> 00:47:36,427
I don't know what you're...

497
00:47:36,567 --> 00:47:40,970
Nothing happens on this island
without me hearing about it.

498
00:47:41,772 --> 00:47:43,034
So...

499
00:47:43,774 --> 00:47:45,708
...let's talk...

500
00:47:45,843 --> 00:47:47,777
...about that dragon.

501
00:47:47,912 --> 00:47:52,042
Oh, gods. Dad, I'm so sorry.
I was going to tell you.

502
00:47:52,383 --> 00:47:54,647
I just didn't know how to...

503
00:47:59,456 --> 00:48:01,617
You're not upset?

504
00:48:01,759 --> 00:48:04,353
What?! I was hoping for this!

505
00:48:05,229 --> 00:48:07,959
- You were?
- And believe me, it only gets better!

506
00:48:08,098 --> 00:48:10,862
Wait till you spill
a Nadder's guts the first time!

507
00:48:11,001 --> 00:48:13,731
And mount your first
Gronckle head on a spear!

508
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:17,705
What a feeling!
You really had me going there, son!

509
00:48:17,841 --> 00:48:22,039
All those years of the worst Viking
Berk has ever seen.

510
00:48:22,179 --> 00:48:25,512
Odin, it was rough.
I almost gave up on you.

511
00:48:25,649 --> 00:48:27,913
And all the while
you were holding out on me!

512
00:48:28,052 --> 00:48:29,917
Oh, Thor Almighty!

513
00:48:31,722 --> 00:48:34,122
With you doing so well in the ring...

514
00:48:35,459 --> 00:48:38,121
...we finally have something
to talk about.

515
00:48:51,842 --> 00:48:55,437
Here, I brought you something,

516
00:48:55,713 --> 00:48:58,443
to keep you safe in the ring.

517
00:48:58,582 --> 00:49:00,709
Wow. Thanks.

518
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:05,720
Your mother would have wanted you to
have it. It's half of her breastplate.

519
00:49:07,324 --> 00:49:11,124
Matching set.
It keeps her close, you know.

520
00:49:11,862 --> 00:49:16,856
Wear it proudly. You deserve it.
You've held up your end of the deal.

521
00:49:22,473 --> 00:49:26,876
- I should really get to bed.
- Yes, good. OK, good talk.

522
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:29,445
- I'll see you back at the house. Great.
- We should do this again.

523
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,808
Thanks for stopping by...

524
00:49:30,948 --> 00:49:34,008
...and for the breast hat.
- I hope you like the hat.

525
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,885
Well... Yep. Good night.

526
00:49:52,870 --> 00:49:55,862
Stay out of my way!
I'm winning this thing.

527
00:49:56,006 --> 00:49:58,736
Please, by all means.

528
00:50:10,788 --> 00:50:12,881
This time, this time for sure!

529
00:50:21,699 --> 00:50:24,497
No! No, son of a half-troll,

530
00:50:24,635 --> 00:50:27,661
- rat-eating, munge-bucket!
- Wait, wait.

531
00:50:27,805 --> 00:50:29,670
- So, later.
- Not so fast.

532
00:50:29,807 --> 00:50:31,798
- I'm kind of late for...
- What?!

533
00:50:31,942 --> 00:50:34,502
Late for what, exactly?

534
00:50:34,645 --> 00:50:37,478
Quiet down! The elder has decided.

535
00:50:48,926 --> 00:50:53,158
You've done it, Hiccup!
You get to kill the dragon!

536
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:57,661
That's my boy!

537
00:50:57,801 --> 00:51:01,532
Yeah. Yes. I can't wait. I am so...

538
00:51:01,672 --> 00:51:03,640
...leaving! We're leaving.

539
00:51:03,774 --> 00:51:08,211
Let's pack up. Looks like you and me
are taking a little vacation.

540
00:51:08,679 --> 00:51:09,941
Forever.

541
00:51:12,683 --> 00:51:14,207
Oh, man.

542
00:51:16,186 --> 00:51:19,246
What the?!
What are you doing here?

543
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:22,558
I want to know what's going on.

544
00:51:22,693 --> 00:51:26,823
No one just gets as good as you do.
Especially you.

545
00:51:26,964 --> 00:51:29,831
Start talking!
Are you training with someone?

546
00:51:29,967 --> 00:51:31,025
Training?

547
00:51:31,168 --> 00:51:32,829
It better not involve this.

548
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:36,565
I know this looks really bad,
but you see...

549
00:51:38,976 --> 00:51:40,967
You're right. You're right.
You're right.

550
00:51:41,111 --> 00:51:46,242
I'm through with the lies.
I've been making outfits. So you got me.

551
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:50,542
It's time everyone knew.
Drag me back, go ahead. Here we go.

552
00:51:51,121 --> 00:51:52,713
Why would you do that?!

553
00:51:52,856 --> 00:51:57,259
That's for the lies.
And that's for everything else.

554
00:51:58,061 --> 00:51:59,050
Oh, man.

555
00:52:00,531 --> 00:52:01,520
Get down!

556
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,865
Run, run!

557
00:52:07,504 --> 00:52:09,267
It's OK! It's OK.

558
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:11,005
She's a friend.

559
00:52:13,143 --> 00:52:14,508
You just scared him.

560
00:52:14,645 --> 00:52:16,135
I scared him?!

561
00:52:17,147 --> 00:52:18,774
Who is "him"?

562
00:52:19,883 --> 00:52:23,876
Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.

563
00:52:29,993 --> 00:52:31,153
We're dead.

564
00:52:32,162 --> 00:52:34,289
Where do you think you're going?

565
00:52:40,437 --> 00:52:43,304
Oh, great Odin's ghost! This is it!

566
00:52:54,184 --> 00:52:56,584
Hiccup, get me down from here!

567
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,881
You have to give me a chance to explain.

568
00:52:59,022 --> 00:53:01,752
I am not listening
to anything you have to say!

569
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:05,328
Then I won't speak.
Just let me show you.

570
00:53:06,864 --> 00:53:08,263
Please, Astrid.

571
00:53:24,214 --> 00:53:25,340
Now get me down.

572
00:53:25,482 --> 00:53:28,212
Toothless, down. Gently.

573
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:32,750
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

574
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:37,626
Toothless!

575
00:53:38,629 --> 00:53:41,621
What is wrong with you?! Bad dragon!

576
00:53:42,766 --> 00:53:45,633
He's not usually like this.
Oh, no.

577
00:53:51,174 --> 00:53:54,302
Toothless, what are you doing?
We need her to like us!

578
00:53:57,314 --> 00:53:59,305
And now the spinning.

579
00:54:00,183 --> 00:54:03,346
Thank you for nothing,
you useless reptile.

580
00:54:04,087 --> 00:54:07,079
OK, I am sorry! I'm sorry.

581
00:54:07,391 --> 00:54:09,086
Just get me off of this thing.

582
00:55:55,799 --> 00:55:59,496
All right, I admit it.
This is pretty cool.

583
00:55:59,836 --> 00:56:02,396
It's amazing.

584
00:56:02,739 --> 00:56:04,263
He's amazing.

585
00:56:06,943 --> 00:56:09,070
So what now?

586
00:56:09,212 --> 00:56:12,079
Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow.

587
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:14,340
You know you'll have to kill...

588
00:56:14,951 --> 00:56:16,077
...kill a dragon.

589
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:17,948
Don't remind me.

590
00:56:19,089 --> 00:56:20,488
Toothless, what's happening?

591
00:56:22,959 --> 00:56:24,358
What is it?

592
00:56:27,164 --> 00:56:28,222
Get down!

593
00:56:45,515 --> 00:56:47,312
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

594
00:56:47,451 --> 00:56:50,420
Toothless, you gotta get us
out of here, bud.

595
00:56:52,989 --> 00:56:55,389
It looks like
they're hauling in their kill.

596
00:56:56,359 --> 00:56:58,122
What does that make us?

597
00:57:41,037 --> 00:57:43,528
What my dad wouldn't give
to find this.

598
00:58:00,457 --> 00:58:03,915
It's satisfying to know that all of
our food has been dumped down a hole.

599
00:58:04,594 --> 00:58:06,926
They're not eating any of it.

600
00:58:22,412 --> 00:58:24,004
What is that?

601
00:58:31,154 --> 00:58:34,146
All right, bud,
we got to get out of here... now!

602
00:58:43,567 --> 00:58:47,367
It totally makes sense.
It's like a giant beehive.

603
00:58:47,504 --> 00:58:49,529
They're the workers
and that's their queen.

604
00:58:49,673 --> 00:58:52,233
It controls them. Let's find your dad.

605
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:53,637
No! No.

606
00:58:53,977 --> 00:58:58,073
No, not yet. They'll kill Toothless.

607
00:58:58,215 --> 00:59:00,979
We have to think this through
carefully.

608
00:59:01,117 --> 00:59:04,052
Hiccup, we just discovered
the dragons' nest,

609
00:59:04,187 --> 00:59:06,951
the thing we've been after
since Vikings first sailed here,

610
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,388
and you want to keep it a secret?

611
00:59:09,526 --> 00:59:12,461
To protect your pet dragon?
Are you serious?

612
00:59:14,598 --> 00:59:15,792
Yes.

613
00:59:23,273 --> 00:59:25,798
OK. Then what do we do?

614
00:59:25,942 --> 00:59:29,673
Just give me until tomorrow.
I'll figure something out.

615
00:59:30,413 --> 00:59:31,607
OK.

616
00:59:33,149 --> 00:59:34,411
That's for kidnapping me.

617
00:59:41,424 --> 00:59:44,154
That's for everything else.

618
00:59:53,336 --> 00:59:55,327
What are you looking at?

619
00:59:56,072 --> 01:00:00,202
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

620
01:00:03,046 --> 01:00:06,413
I can show my face in public again!

621
01:00:08,752 --> 01:00:11,880
If someone had told me
that in a few short weeks

622
01:00:12,022 --> 01:00:16,618
Hiccup would go from, well,
being Hiccup

623
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:21,288
to placing first in dragon training,
well, I would have tied him to a mast

624
01:00:21,431 --> 01:00:24,025
and shipped him off
for fear he'd gone mad!

625
01:00:24,701 --> 01:00:26,032
And you know it!

626
01:00:28,505 --> 01:00:32,999
But here we are.
And no one is more surprised

627
01:00:33,143 --> 01:00:36,169
or more proud than I am.

628
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:40,116
Today, my boy becomes a Viking.

629
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:43,447
Today, he becomes one of us!

630
01:00:47,457 --> 01:00:49,357
Be careful with that dragon.

631
01:00:49,492 --> 01:00:52,950
- It's not the dragon I'm worried about.
- What are you going to do?

632
01:00:53,096 --> 01:00:56,190
Put an end to this. I have to try.

633
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,336
Astrid, if something goes wrong,

634
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:02,495
just make sure
they don't find Toothless.

635
01:01:03,206 --> 01:01:06,733
I will. Just promise me
it won't go wrong.

636
01:01:07,477 --> 01:01:10,742
It's time, Hiccup. Knock 'em dead.

637
01:01:16,286 --> 01:01:18,777
Yeah! Show 'em how it's done.

638
01:01:18,922 --> 01:01:22,153
Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup! Hiccup!

639
01:01:34,671 --> 01:01:36,195
I would have gone for the hammer.

640
01:01:40,343 --> 01:01:41,537
I'm ready.

641
01:02:05,602 --> 01:02:08,196
Go on, Hiccup. Give it to him!

642
01:02:12,642 --> 01:02:13,973
What is he doing?

643
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:19,374
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.

644
01:02:27,257 --> 01:02:28,417
I'm not one of them.

645
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:34,824
What's he thinking?

646
01:02:35,398 --> 01:02:36,865
- Stop the fight.
- No!

647
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:39,733
I need you all to see this.

648
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:42,797
They're not what we think they are.

649
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:44,939
We don't have to kill them.

650
01:02:46,476 --> 01:02:48,671
I said, stop the fight!

651
01:02:56,219 --> 01:02:57,413
Out of my way!

652
01:02:57,687 --> 01:02:58,745
Hiccup!

653
01:03:19,609 --> 01:03:20,735
Hiccup!

654
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:28,812
This way!

655
01:03:49,205 --> 01:03:50,433
Night Fury!

656
01:04:09,025 --> 01:04:10,822
Toothless, go. Get out of here.

657
01:04:13,029 --> 01:04:14,257
Go, go!

658
01:04:14,397 --> 01:04:15,386
Stoick, no!

659
01:04:15,532 --> 01:04:16,931
Dad, he won't hurt you!

660
01:04:17,934 --> 01:04:20,960
No, don't!
You're only making it worse!

661
01:04:22,105 --> 01:04:23,094
Toothless, stop!

662
01:04:24,874 --> 01:04:26,705
No! No!

663
01:04:30,346 --> 01:04:31,335
Get him!

664
01:04:34,951 --> 01:04:36,942
No, no! Please just don't hurt him!

665
01:04:37,654 --> 01:04:39,053
Please don't hurt him.

666
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:47,519
Put it with the others.

667
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:52,824
I should have known.
I should have seen the signs.

668
01:04:52,969 --> 01:04:54,834
- Dad?
- We had a deal!

669
01:04:54,971 --> 01:04:59,032
I know we did. That was before...
It's all so messed up.

670
01:04:59,175 --> 01:05:02,633
So everything in the ring,
a trick? A lie?

671
01:05:02,779 --> 01:05:06,909
I screwed up. I should have
told you before now. I just...

672
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:10,645
Take this out on me, be mad at me,
but please, just don't hurt Toothless.

673
01:05:10,787 --> 01:05:13,984
The dragon?
That's what you're worried about?

674
01:05:14,123 --> 01:05:15,852
Not the people you almost killed?

675
01:05:15,992 --> 01:05:18,426
He was protecting me!
He's not dangerous.

676
01:05:18,561 --> 01:05:20,586
They've killed hundreds of us!

677
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:22,459
And we've killed thousands of them!

678
01:05:22,599 --> 01:05:27,901
They defend themselves, that's all!
They raid us because they have to.

679
01:05:28,037 --> 01:05:31,905
If they don't bring enough food back,
they'll be eaten themselves.

680
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:36,375
There's something else
on their island. It's a dragon like...

681
01:05:36,512 --> 01:05:39,276
Their island?
So you've been to the nest?

682
01:05:39,415 --> 01:05:41,246
- Did I say nest?
- How did you find it?

683
01:05:41,384 --> 01:05:43,944
What? No, I didn't. Toothless did.

684
01:05:44,087 --> 01:05:46,783
Only a dragon can find the island.

685
01:05:48,124 --> 01:05:51,287
No, no, no. No, Dad.
No, please, it's not what you think.

686
01:05:51,427 --> 01:05:54,521
You don't know what you're up against.
It's like nothing you've ever seen.

687
01:05:54,664 --> 01:05:58,600
Dad, please. I promise you,
you can't win this one!

688
01:05:58,735 --> 01:06:00,794
No, Dad. No.

689
01:06:00,937 --> 01:06:03,906
For once in your life,
would you please just listen to me?!

690
01:06:07,677 --> 01:06:11,443
You've thrown your lot in with them.
You're not a Viking.

691
01:06:13,716 --> 01:06:15,581
You're not my son.

692
01:06:18,788 --> 01:06:20,050
Ready the ships!

693
01:06:32,068 --> 01:06:33,262
This way.

694
01:07:15,611 --> 01:07:17,135
Set sail!

695
01:07:17,513 --> 01:07:19,879
We head for Helheim's Gate.

696
01:07:28,424 --> 01:07:30,756
Lead us home, devil.

697
01:07:51,647 --> 01:07:53,137
It's a mess.

698
01:07:54,484 --> 01:07:57,749
You must feel horrible.
You've lost everything:

699
01:07:57,887 --> 01:08:00,788
Your father, your tribe,
your best friend.

700
01:08:00,923 --> 01:08:03,118
Thank you for summing that up.

701
01:08:04,961 --> 01:08:08,488
Why couldn't I have killed that dragon
when I found him in the woods?

702
01:08:08,631 --> 01:08:12,897
- Would have been better for everyone.
- Yep. The rest of us would've done it.

703
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:15,635
So why didn't you?

704
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:21,071
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.

705
01:08:22,044 --> 01:08:23,978
- I couldn't.
- That's not an answer.

706
01:08:24,113 --> 01:08:26,445
Why is this so important
to you all of a sudden?

707
01:08:26,582 --> 01:08:29,779
Because I want to remember
what you say right now.

708
01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:35,049
For the love of... I was a coward.
I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.

709
01:08:35,191 --> 01:08:36,453
You said "wouldn't".

710
01:08:36,592 --> 01:08:38,787
Whatever! I wouldn't!

711
01:08:38,928 --> 01:08:42,830
Three hundred years and I'm the first
Viking who wouldn't kill a dragon.

712
01:08:47,303 --> 01:08:49,237
First one to ride one, though.

713
01:08:51,707 --> 01:08:52,696
So?

714
01:08:55,678 --> 01:08:59,045
I wouldn't kill him because
he looked as frightened as I was.

715
01:09:00,116 --> 01:09:03,711
I looked at him and I saw myself.

716
01:09:05,555 --> 01:09:10,219
I bet he's really frightened now.
What are you going to do about it?

717
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:16,189
- Probably something stupid.
- Good, but you've already done that.

718
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,791
Then something crazy.

719
01:09:20,703 --> 01:09:22,796
That's more like it.

720
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:34,545
Sound your positions.
Stay within earshot.

721
01:09:34,684 --> 01:09:37,209
- Here!
- One length to your stern.

722
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:42,614
Listen, Stoick, I was overhearing some
of the men and, well, some of them

723
01:09:42,758 --> 01:09:46,387
are wondering what it is
we're up to here. Not me, of course.

724
01:09:46,529 --> 01:09:49,089
I know you're always the man
with the plan. But some,

725
01:09:49,232 --> 01:09:52,759
not me, are wondering if there is
in fact a plan at all

726
01:09:52,902 --> 01:09:56,531
- and what it might be.
- Find the nest and take it.

727
01:09:56,672 --> 01:09:58,833
Of course. Send them running.

728
01:09:58,975 --> 01:10:01,739
The old Viking fallback.
Nice and simple.

729
01:10:10,653 --> 01:10:12,314
Step aside.

730
01:10:25,668 --> 01:10:26,794
Bear to port.

731
01:10:31,774 --> 01:10:36,074
If you're planning on getting eaten,
I'd definitely go with the Gronckle.

732
01:10:37,213 --> 01:10:41,343
You were wise to seek help
from the world's most deadly weapon.

733
01:10:41,484 --> 01:10:42,473
It's me.

734
01:10:42,618 --> 01:10:45,018
- I love this plan.
- I didn't...

735
01:10:45,154 --> 01:10:48,021
You're crazy. I like that.

736
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:50,857
So, what is the plan?

737
01:11:01,037 --> 01:11:02,800
That's not really encouraging.

738
01:11:05,174 --> 01:11:07,233
I was wondering where that went.

739
01:11:19,221 --> 01:11:22,486
Stay low and ready your weapons.

740
01:11:38,174 --> 01:11:39,436
We're here.

741
01:12:12,408 --> 01:12:14,933
- Wait! What are you?
- Relax.

742
01:12:15,077 --> 01:12:17,272
It's OK. It's OK.

743
01:12:28,991 --> 01:12:29,980
Where are you going?

744
01:12:30,126 --> 01:12:32,754
You'll need something
to help you hold on.

745
01:12:41,837 --> 01:12:46,035
When we crack this mountain open,
all hell is going to break loose.

746
01:12:46,175 --> 01:12:49,167
In my undies.
Good thing I brought extras.

747
01:12:49,311 --> 01:12:52,576
No matter how this ends,
it ends today.

748
01:13:47,536 --> 01:13:49,265
Is that it?

749
01:13:53,943 --> 01:13:55,274
We've done it!

750
01:14:04,186 --> 01:14:08,350
This isn't over!
Form your ranks! Hold together!

751
01:14:21,504 --> 01:14:23,131
Get clear!

752
01:14:32,648 --> 01:14:35,208
Beard of Thor! What is that?!

753
01:14:39,421 --> 01:14:41,286
Odin help us.

754
01:14:46,095 --> 01:14:47,153
Catapults!

755
01:14:56,839 --> 01:14:59,239
- Get to the ships!
- No! No!

756
01:15:12,121 --> 01:15:14,089
- Smart, that one.
- I was a fool.

757
01:15:14,223 --> 01:15:16,384
Lead the men
to the far side of the island!

758
01:15:16,525 --> 01:15:17,719
Gobber, go with men!

759
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:20,852
I think I'll stay, in case your
thinking of doing something crazy.

760
01:15:20,996 --> 01:15:24,159
I can buy them a few minutes
if I give that thing someone to hunt!

761
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:25,824
Then I can double that time.

762
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:31,870
- Here!
- Oh, no! Here!

763
01:15:42,017 --> 01:15:45,214
Come on! Fight me!

764
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:47,219
No, me!

765
01:15:53,829 --> 01:15:56,093
Ruff, Tuff! Watch your backs!

766
01:15:56,232 --> 01:15:58,427
Move, Fishlegs!

767
01:15:58,567 --> 01:16:02,435
Look at us! We're on a dragon.
We're on dragons! All of us!

768
01:16:04,106 --> 01:16:06,370
Up! Let's move it!

769
01:16:06,876 --> 01:16:11,313
Every bit the boar-headed
stubborn Viking you ever were!

770
01:16:13,082 --> 01:16:14,743
- Fishlegs, break it down!
- OK.

771
01:16:14,884 --> 01:16:17,717
Heavily armored skull and tail
made for bashing and crushing!

772
01:16:17,853 --> 01:16:21,880
Steer clear of both. Small eyes, large
nostrils! Relies on hearing and smell!

773
01:16:22,024 --> 01:16:25,425
OK, Lout, legs! Hang in its blind spot,
make noise, keep it confused!

774
01:16:25,561 --> 01:16:29,327
Ruff, Tuff, find out
if it has a shot limit! Make it mad!

775
01:16:29,465 --> 01:16:30,864
That's my specialty!

776
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,333
Since when?! Everyone knows
I'm more irritating! See.

777
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:37,701
Just do what I told you!
I'll be back as soon as I can!

778
01:16:38,107 --> 01:16:40,632
- Don't worry! We got it covered!
- Yeah!

779
01:16:49,618 --> 01:16:50,710
- Troll!
- Butt elf!

780
01:16:50,853 --> 01:16:52,377
Bride of Grendel!

781
01:16:58,193 --> 01:17:00,661
This thing doesn't have a blind spot!

782
01:17:03,432 --> 01:17:04,421
There!

783
01:17:12,908 --> 01:17:14,068
Go help the others!

784
01:17:15,945 --> 01:17:17,310
OK, hold on. Hold on.

785
01:17:21,283 --> 01:17:23,751
- It's working!
- Yeah, it's working!

786
01:17:33,395 --> 01:17:36,762
I've lost power on the Gronckle!
Snotlout, do something!

787
01:17:40,202 --> 01:17:41,726
I'm OK!

788
01:17:42,204 --> 01:17:43,364
Less OK!

789
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:49,738
I can't miss! What's wrong, buddy?
Something in your eye?

790
01:17:53,782 --> 01:17:55,613
Yeah! You're the Viking!

791
01:18:33,355 --> 01:18:34,481
Dad?

792
01:18:53,275 --> 01:18:54,674
You got it, bud.

793
01:18:57,513 --> 01:18:58,639
Hiccup!

794
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:04,347
I'm sorry... for everything.

795
01:19:04,753 --> 01:19:05,845
Yeah. Me, too.

796
01:19:06,288 --> 01:19:07,880
You don't have to go up there.

797
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:11,957
We're Vikings.
It's an occupational hazard.

798
01:19:13,328 --> 01:19:16,297
I'm proud to call you my son.

799
01:19:17,699 --> 01:19:18,688
Thanks, Dad.

800
01:19:24,807 --> 01:19:26,069
He's up!

801
01:19:28,977 --> 01:19:30,535
Get Snotlout out of there.

802
01:19:30,679 --> 01:19:31,941
- I'm on it!
- I'm on it first!

803
01:19:32,081 --> 01:19:33,673
- Hey, let me drive!
- I'm ahead of you.

804
01:19:33,816 --> 01:19:35,283
No, this way.

805
01:19:35,417 --> 01:19:37,612
- Don't push me!
- I'll take your teeth out!

806
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:43,419
I can't believe that worked!

807
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:52,031
Night Fury!

808
01:19:52,167 --> 01:19:53,896
Get down!

809
01:20:03,779 --> 01:20:04,837
Did you get her?

810
01:20:15,324 --> 01:20:16,313
Go.

811
01:20:16,492 --> 01:20:20,895
That thing has wings.
OK, let's see if it can use them!

812
01:20:36,845 --> 01:20:38,836
You think that did it?

813
01:20:43,785 --> 01:20:45,548
Well, he can fly.

814
01:21:06,408 --> 01:21:09,138
OK, Toothless, time to disappear.

815
01:21:09,278 --> 01:21:10,506
Come on, bud!

816
01:21:16,585 --> 01:21:18,212
Here it comes!

817
01:22:10,572 --> 01:22:11,903
Watch out!

818
01:22:14,076 --> 01:22:16,408
OK, time's up! Let's see if this works.

819
01:22:19,214 --> 01:22:21,205
Come on! Is that the best you can do?!

820
01:22:39,101 --> 01:22:41,501
Stay with me, buddy.
Just a bit longer.

821
01:22:46,174 --> 01:22:47,766
Hold, Toothless.

822
01:22:48,577 --> 01:22:49,703
Now!

823
01:23:13,802 --> 01:23:14,791
No.

824
01:23:15,304 --> 01:23:16,669
No!

825
01:23:32,421 --> 01:23:33,752
Hiccup!

826
01:23:34,890 --> 01:23:36,551
Hiccup!

827
01:23:37,826 --> 01:23:39,088
Son!

828
01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:43,188
Hiccup.

829
01:24:04,986 --> 01:24:06,647
Oh, son.

830
01:24:08,223 --> 01:24:09,690
I did this.

831
01:24:39,488 --> 01:24:42,753
Oh, son, I'm so sorry.

832
01:24:49,464 --> 01:24:50,453
Hiccup!

833
01:24:57,239 --> 01:25:00,231
He's alive.
You brought him back alive.

834
01:25:17,259 --> 01:25:20,194
Thank you for saving my son.

835
01:25:20,996 --> 01:25:23,988
Well, you know... most of him.

836
01:25:42,284 --> 01:25:43,876
Hey, Toothless.

837
01:25:44,753 --> 01:25:47,017
I'm happy to see you, too.

838
01:25:50,192 --> 01:25:52,752
I'm in my house.

839
01:25:53,895 --> 01:25:55,760
You're in my house.

840
01:25:56,031 --> 01:25:57,726
Does my dad know you're here?

841
01:25:57,866 --> 01:26:00,027
What? OK, OK.

842
01:26:00,535 --> 01:26:02,628
Toothless, no. No, Toothless.

843
01:26:02,771 --> 01:26:04,898
Toothless! Oh, come on.

844
01:26:43,645 --> 01:26:46,136
OK. Thanks, bud.

845
01:26:56,825 --> 01:27:00,386
- Toothless, stay here.
- Come on, guys. Get ready!

846
01:27:00,529 --> 01:27:01,791
Hold on tight! Here we go!

847
01:27:05,033 --> 01:27:06,159
What?

848
01:27:14,409 --> 01:27:16,639
I knew it. I'm dead.

849
01:27:17,779 --> 01:27:21,772
No, but you gave it your best shot.
So, what do you think?

850
01:27:21,917 --> 01:27:23,578
Hey, look, it's Hiccup!

851
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:26,282
It's Hiccup!

852
01:27:28,123 --> 01:27:31,991
Turns out all we needed
was a little more of this.

853
01:27:32,127 --> 01:27:34,186
You just gestured to all of me.

854
01:27:35,263 --> 01:27:38,391
Well, most of you.
That bit's my handiwork.

855
01:27:38,867 --> 01:27:42,064
With a little Hiccup flair thrown in.
You think it'll do?

856
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:44,529
I might make a few tweaks.

857
01:27:46,408 --> 01:27:48,273
That's for scaring me.

858
01:27:48,410 --> 01:27:50,970
What is it always going
to be this way? 'Cause...

859
01:27:53,548 --> 01:27:55,072
...I could get used to it.

860
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:00,185
Welcome home.

861
01:28:00,322 --> 01:28:02,586
- Night Fury!
- Get down!

862
01:28:13,735 --> 01:28:14,724
You ready?

863
01:28:16,871 --> 01:28:19,362
This is Berk.

864
01:28:19,841 --> 01:28:23,607
It snows nine months of the year
and hails the other three.

865
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:28,914
Any food that grows here
is tough and tasteless.

866
01:28:30,452 --> 01:28:33,580
The people that grow here
are even more so.

867
01:28:37,459 --> 01:28:39,586
The only upsides are the pets.

868
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:46,261
While other places
have ponies or parrots...

869
01:28:47,602 --> 01:28:49,126
...we have...

870
01:28:50,205 --> 01:28:51,604
...dragons.
