the finale. Where is he?

52
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:48,328
Fanny, honey,
he said if he could make it here tonight,

53
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,290
he would try to get here
before the finale.

54
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,793
He'll be here.
Don't get your hopes up too high.

00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,254
Thanks for everything, Fanny.
I hate to see the show close.

I hope so.

I'm not really...

88
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,800
Maybe you're not really,
but I am really...

89
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,720
What is that supposed to mean?
How do I know?

90
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,347
I got the willies too.
The show closing‒

91
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,850
Hey, can you balance
a checkbook?

92
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,060
Well, now, you know,
I bet I could,

93
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,062
if somebody showed me how.
Yeah.

94
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:04,566
You don't have to offer me a job.
I couldn't take money from you.

95
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,652
Who's offering you money?
You think I got any money?

96
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,654
We'll all be back
in here soon.

97
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,992
You bet we will, Ben.
You better start getting the gum off the seats.

98
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,328
Hey, I got a terrific idea.
What?

99
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:20,665
Move into my place, Bobby. No pay,
but room and "board" you won't be.

100
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,627
I think we can help each other.
I mean it.

101
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:27,005
I'm going to say
something stupid.

102
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,674
I know a little of what
you're going through,

103
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,303
'cause, you see,
I miss Nick too.

104
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:37,098
So I do know a little bit
of what it's like.

105
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,227
Now, it's just
a matter of time, Fanny.

106
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,437
Yeah, and Nick's pride.

107
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:46,858
He will make a comeback,
and when he does, you'll be there.

108
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,904
Yeah. I ain't goin' nowhere, kid,
except home.

109
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:56,284
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on. I'll race ya.

110
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:00,288
When do you start
the new Follies?

111
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,499
He can't raise
the money, Barney.

112
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:07,504
Ziegfeld can't raise the money?
Not even from Buck?

113
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,966
Things are tough all over.
Even the grocer is suing us.

114
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:15,136
It's going to look lousy going to court
over cornflakes and toilet paper.

115
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:19,891
Fanny, darling, I think
I'd better make you a loan.

116
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,645
Barney, "dollink," I think I'd better sell my house.
What do you think I can get?

117
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,898
Not anywhere near what it's worth‒ not in this market,

118
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:30,235
and not with the mortgage it carries.
What about a second mortgage?

119
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,153
What about a loan?

120
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,698
What's the use of borrowing?
I just have to give it back.

121
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:38,493
- Of course, there are Fran's holdings.
- I didn't hear it.

122
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,495
I told you Mr.
Baruch was engaged— It's all right.

123
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,247
He'll understand.
He's got an important client.

124
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,500
I'm sorry. There's a very important meeting.
No interruptions.

125
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:50,088
Oh, I do apologize, Mr. Baruch.
Excuse me for busting in like this.

126
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,091
I brought you this milk shake.
I wanted to get it to you before it lost its foam.

127
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,595
Sorry to bust in on you
like this, Miss Brice.

128
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,807
I hope the milk shake's not C.O.D., kid.

129
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,811
Now that we're all here,
is there anything I can do for ya?

130
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:07,314
Fanny, Mr. Rose
is a man of many parts.

131
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:11,109
Among other things, he's a champion speed-writer,
200 words a minute.

132
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,737
We were just going over Miss
Brice's daughter's holdings.

133
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,865
Maybe I can be of some help.
Do you mind?

134
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,117
Why should I mind?
Great.

135
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,161
So I‒

136
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:25,165
I'm so‒ I'd like to make a few suggestions for Fran.

137
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,168
This is rough,
but I think you should take a few more losses.

138
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,880
These will only go lower,
so I'd sell...

139
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,049

142
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:42,140

There's an act in there somewhere.

163
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,362
Now, if you'd allow me
to make you a loan?

164
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,489
Thanks, Barney.
Thank you for seeing me.

165
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:44,494
Anytime, my dear.
Anytime. Come on, Bobby.

166
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,871
Nice seeing you again, Bobby.
Same here.

167
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,041
Uh, listen, uh‒

168
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:55,171
Miss Brice, hang‒ hang on to that AT&T, huh?
Believe me.

169
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,096
Who's the pansy?

170
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,098
Mr. Moore is
Miss Brice's secretary now.

171
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,559
He's a very old friend,
from the days with Nick.

172
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,687
Oh. She should have
taken a loss.

173
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:14,691
Look at this child.
That was gorgeous, sweetheart!

174
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,985
You'd better get
out there and hustle.

175
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,279
Get an act together. Play the Palace.
Why don't you cut a record?

176
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:23,324
Who can afford to put together an act? It takes money.
Where am I going to get new material?

177
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,411
I know what we should do.
Get all duded up. Go around to all the spots.

178
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,705
Fran.

179
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,124
Merci beaucoup,
monsieur Cornell.

180
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:35,628
Oh, mon Dieu.

181
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:40,592
Right, right.
Wonderful, wonderful. Ah.

182
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:43,678
What'd she say?
It makes her mad when I let my nose drip.

183
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:48,308
Oh, so you mean anytime my nose
drips‒ anytime my nose drips...

184
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,643
I have to say,
"mouce mi name"? Yeah.

185
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:54,314
Let's do like I said, huh?
Go out and tour the clubs.

186
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:59,027
Catch all the acts and just see if
there's anything we can borrow.

Oh, there's Fanny Brice.

197
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,487
Why don't you find out
who wrote that song?

198
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:46,157
Oh, yeah, sure.
Order me a stinger, huh? Okay.

199
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,619
Hey, Buck, how are ya?
Bobby. Fanny!

200
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:53,957
Buck! How are they running?
Dandy. It's good to see ya.

201
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,501
I'd like you to meet
Miss Norma Butler.

202
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,963
Glad to meet you.
It's a thrill to meet you.

203
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,466
Nice set of beads.
Thank you.

204
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,803
Fanny,
I'll call you. Okay.

205
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,180
Let's go, baby.
Bye.

206
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:15,186
Hey there, Miss Brice.
How are ya, huh?

207
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:19,148
That was quite an entrance you made.
You really know how to part the waters.

208
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,734
It ain't difficult to part
the waters in a bathtub.

209
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,279
Well, it's a small thing,
but my own.

210
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,281
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

211
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,325
Good for you.
Hello there, Joe.

212
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,872
You don't remember me, huh?
From Mr. Baruch's office.

213
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,208
"Sell, sell."
Did you hang on to AT&T like I told you?

214
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,210
Oh, yeah, I did.

215
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:42,463
That's good. And, kid,
you better be right.

216
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,050
I'm always right.

217
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,387
You got some ashes on your jacket.
Oh.

218
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:52,557
Last time I saw you,
you were working for Barney Baruch,

219
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:56,269
very respectable,
and now suddenly you're in the clip business?

220
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,105
Not so suddenly.

221
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,774
I haven't worked
for Mr. Baruch in years.

222
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,527
We're just friends.

223
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,946
You mind, uh‒
No, go right ahead.

224
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,660
How do ya‒
Oh, excuse me.

225
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:16,539
Comme ça. Ah, thank you.
That's cute.

226
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,667
You know, to tell you
the truth, uh‒

227
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,004
I knew you were
in that office that day.

228
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,382
I just wanted
to meet you. Hmm.

229
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:30,553
Waiter.

230
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,932
One scotch and water, please, and, uh,
one stinger.

231
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,018
What'll you have?
The drinks are on the house, huh?

232
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,020
Bring me the usual.

233
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,481
What's the usual?
Something you stir up in the back room?

234
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,817
I drink celery tonic.
You drink celery tonic?

235
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,320
My mother said,
"A boozer is a loser."

236
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,573
You had a mother?

237
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:55,370
So how'd you get from Baruch to here,
and why?

238
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,706
Maybe I wanted to wear a black hat and meet girls.
You like the girls, huh?

239
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,708
Sorry I took so long.
Me too.

240
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:05,838
The guy who wrote that song runs this club.
His name's Rose.

241
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,424
Here.

242
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,885
Is that a fact?

243
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,514
Bobby, I'm sorry.

244
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,308
You remember Mr. Rose here
from Baruch's office?

245
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,812
Oh! Oh, yeah, sure.

246
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:24,148
I didn't recognize you
without your milk shake.

247
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:28,486
You really write that number
"More Than You Know"?

248
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,155
Miss Brice,
I wrote "More Than You Know" before breakfast.

249
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,534
"When a Woman Loves a Man,"
I wrote that before I put the cream in my coffee.

250
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,869
Okay, swifty, I get the message.
I might like to record it.

251
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,790
Maybe we can get together on a second number.
I'm sure we can.

252
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:45,837
I have three numbers I think
would be terrific for ya.

253
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:51,092
Unfortunately, I promised them to Ruth Etting.

254
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,886
Maybe I can get one of them back.
I don't know. It won't be easy.

255
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:57,974
If I do,
I'll let you have it for what Etting pays,

256
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,394
which is one-third off my usual price,
'cause I like the broad.

257
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:05,314
To tell you the truth,
I feel a little sorry for her.

258
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,359
Do you believe
your ears?

259
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:13,865
Kid, new songwriters usually
pay me to record their stuff.

260
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,577
Well, I ain't that new.

261
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,871
I'll tell you the truth.

262
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,206
"More Than You Know" I don't like well enough to buy.

263
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,168
I only like it
well enough to steal.

264
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,920
That's exactly what
I said in the first place.

265
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,465
"More Than You Know"
is a definite literal steal.

266
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,925
But take it. It's yours.
I don't want to talk about that.

267
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,345
I want to talk about the other number.
The one I got in mind for you, you're gonna love it.

268
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,891
You're gonna love what I do for your song, sonny.
When I record a number, it sells.

269
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:44,937
I know that. You're the greatest.
I'm lucky you know I'm alive.

270
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,648
Please, let me talk
about something else.

271
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,486
This other number‒ I believe in this number so much‒

272
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,988
I believe in it so much
I'm willing to gamble with it.

273
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,949
If you record this number,
I'll make you a full partner in the publishing.

274
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,327
I'll give you the rights
to record for zip, zero.

275
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,580
If it sells under 100,000,
we split the royalties down the middle.

276
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:06,292
If it goes over 100,000, give me a rollback to
equal my full percentage from the first share.

277
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,961
And that...
I mean, that is only...

278
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:13,007
That's before we even start talking about
the really big numbers, which is sheet music.

279
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,928
So, you see, it's all
a steal metaphorically.

280
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,514
Metaphorically, huh?
Well, sure.

281
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,729
This is a shrewd kid, Bobby.

282
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:30,900
I think I'll marry him.
I hate paying for material.

283
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,611
Even laughs in
the right places.

284
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:38,825
Tell you what, if we hate the same people
and you get your suit cleaned, it's a match.

285
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,288
Ruth Etting, my ass.

286
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,667
That's swell, dear. Anytime I want your ass,
I'll know what to call it.

287
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:51,587
Come on, Bobby, huh?
From you I expect a lead sheet. Oh, yeah, Thursday.

288
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,589
Can I have my cigarettes, please? Hey!

00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:09,081

It sounds lousy. The strings are too hot.

When did you see
Billy Rose last?

348
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,836
Three days ago at the recording session.
Why?

349
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,507
I don't believe it. Of course,
nobody can believe him.

350
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:08,219
He has just announced
a show starring W.C. Fields,

351
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:13,974
Marilyn Miller, Eddie Cantor,
Bert Robbins and you.

352
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:19,146
In that order? Well, actually,
you do get first billing.

353
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:27,738
Well, I guess I'd better go have
a little talk with the little man.

354
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,093
All right, listen to me.

355
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:52,096
What are you, a decorator?
You're a painter.

356
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:55,474
You paint the chair.
I'm gonna hold this watch on ya.

357
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:59,270
However long it takes you to paint that chair,
we're gonna multiply it by 200,

358
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,856
so we both know exactly how long
it takes to paint 200 chairs.

359
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:05,901
That's exactly the amount of time I pay ya for.
Got that? Yeah, sure, Mr. Rose.

360
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,155
Where do you want me to do the painting?
Where?

361
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,824
Right here, ya goddamn thief,
where I can watch ya. Oh!

362
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,826
You got a cigarette?
Yeah.

363
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,870
Yeah, come in.

364
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,289
Here you go.

365
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:22,293
Oh, geez, it's
a wonderful, uh, surprise.

366
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:25,087
I'll bet.

367
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:28,340
Yeah. What are you stand‒ Go out in the hall.
Do it in the hall.

368
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,135
Oh, sure.
Do it in the line of the door where I can see ya.

369
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,345
Excuse me, Miss Brice.
Painting contract.

370
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,056
Mm-hmm.
The chairs.

371
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,352
Yeah. All right, come on.
You ready?

372
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:42,480
One second, one second.
Come on.

373
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:45,065
All right, go.
Go.

374
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:51,197
Thievin' bastards.
You gotta watch them every minute.

375
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:58,078
Well, I'm, uh, very glad
that you came up here.

376
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:02,500
Uh, I'm sorry
you found me like this.

377
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,419
But I worked very late
at the club, and I, uh‒

378
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,505
I appreciate
you're a hard worker.

379
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:10,841
What I don't appreciate is that you're a fast worker,
ya little creep.

380
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,470
Where do you get the nerve using my
name in your cockamamie news release?

381
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,514
You interested
in an explanation?

382
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,140
I'm interested
in retractions.

383
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:21,185
Maybe you won't be interested in retractions.
Maybe you'll agree to‒

384
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,813
To what? To be in some half-assed, sandlot,
two-bit production...

385
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,816
scratched up by some tasteless,
crummy Johnny-come-lately hustler like you?

386
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,860
I was a Ziegfeld star
when you were sweating...

387
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:32,196
your way to 50 words a minute
in shorthand class.

388
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,198
Don't try to hustle me,
ya little bum!

389
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:37,993
I know where I can get
$50,000‒ right now.

390
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,079
Oh, really?
Yes.

391
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,122
I got the songs. I know
where I can get the sketches.

392
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,417
If I get you, I can pull in another star like Williams,
but it's you I really want.

393
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:49,505
You can get 50,000 when Ziegfeld can't?
That's right.

394
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:53,259
Hey, that ain't good enough.
That's three rungs in two-and-a-half minutes.

395
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,427
You can do better than that.
Sure, Mr. Rose. Sure.

396
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:58,556
Go ahead.
Where?

397
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:03,602
Where what?
Where can you get the 50,000?

398
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,646
Bolton.
Buck Bolton?

399
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,023
That's right. I don't believe you.
Buck is Ziggy's bank.

400
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,025
He's mine now.
How?

401
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,027
Believes in me.

402
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,157
I don't know.
Maybe I'm wrong.

403
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:21,078
Maybe you're not just
a nickel-and-dime hustler.

404
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:25,666
Maybe what you are is
a really big-time pimp!

405
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,668
Buck's got
a new girl, right?

406
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,504
Does she get billing?

407
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,590
She work sketches?
Don't lie.

408
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,842
Not yours.

409
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:39,221
Look, Fanny,
you need a show. Really?

410
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,265
I don't see why you have
to try to scrape up an act...

411
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:44,268
and work for farkakte lousy two
a day when you can do a show.

412
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,063
- You need me.
- You're full of it. You need me.

413
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,149
Let me rephrase it.
Please. Use me.

414
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:53,611
Yeah, let me rephrase it.
Don't use me.

415
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:59,325
You want me to be in your cockamamie show?
You ask me, and you ask me nice.

416
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,539
Fanny, uh, do‒ Do my show.

417
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,168

I need you.

421
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,146
Just don't aggravate me.

422
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,898
You'll do it?

423
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,651
What a crummy world.

424
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,570
That a girl. Come on.

425
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,490
Why don't you ever get a manicure?
It only costs a buck.

426
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:42,993
It's not the buck.
It takes 20 minutes.

427
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,829
I'm done, Mr. Rose.
All finished. Yeah.

428
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,582
I gotta use your john, kid.
Yeah, well, listen, uh‒

429
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:52,169
Oh, hello there.
Is that the door to the john?

430
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,255
You're Fanny Brice!
I don't believe it.

431
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,257
What, that Fanny Brice
goes to the can?

432
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:01,553
Oh, my God, Miss Brice.
I see all your shows every chance I get.

433

Excuse me. Mr. Rose?
Yeah, uh, sorry.

436
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,657
What do you got there?
Eight minutes.

437
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:24,368
Eight minutes. Me too.
Eight minutes a coat per chair.

438
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,079
You want two coats?
Yeah, yeah, two coats.

439
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,331
That's two coats.
That's 16 chairs‒

440
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:32,918
16 minutes per chair
times 200 is 3,200 minutes.

441

Here. Keep this.
Thanks, mister.

656
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,721
Oh, no, no.

657
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,890
What's that?
It's the reviews.

658
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,393
Of what?
The first act.

659
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,145
Thank God they couldn't
stick around for the second.

660
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,565
Well, there are
at least ten people out there.

661
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,067
I am going to lay them
in the aisles.

662
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:53,528
Ow! Oh, my eye!
Oh, Fanny!

663
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,436
Fanny?

664
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,438
Fanny?

665
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:31,274
Shh!
Get me the house detective!

666
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,484
Shh, shh. It's me.
It's me, Billy. Are you crazy?

667
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,486
It's only a joke.
Are you crazy?

668
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,197
It's only a joke, honey.
Yeah, it's me, Billy.

669
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,700
I got those tickets for you for the show.
We were just rehearsing a scene.

670
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,869
You stupid idiot!
Charades. Yeah.

671
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,496
Charades? You crazy?
I'll call you later. Right. Good-bye.

672
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,999
You some kind of
break-and-enter artist,

673
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:50,001
as well as trying to stamp out
show business single-footed?

674
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,128
I figured you wouldn't let me in,
so I borrowed‒ You figured right.

675
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:55,089
I borrowed a pass key. You stole my pass
key and nearly gave me a heart attack!

676
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,842
I gotta talk to ya,
how we gotta fix the show. "We"?

677
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,386
Yeah.
Mr. Rose.

678
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:05,058
I have been through burlesque,
Ziegfeld, childbirth, divorce, the crash.

679
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,852
That's terrible. Last year I went to
see my daughter ride in a pony show.

680
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:12,732
I went backstage to the stalls. To put it short,
I've also been kicked in the ass by a horse.

681
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,817
That's awful.
But I have never‒

682
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,987
I have never been through
anything like last night.

683
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,657
I know. I know.
What?

684
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,284
We got a few weak spots.
We can fix it.

685
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,244
Buffalo shit!

686
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,455
Look, uh‒
Get out of my room!

687
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,666
You said what you've been through‒ Childbirth!
Was that easy?

688
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,126
It was like pushing a piano
through a transom.

689
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:33,836
We gotta push this one through.

690
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:38,299
You're gonna push this one, buster.
8:00 A.M., I call my lawyers. Get out!

691
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,843
All right.

692
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:46,182
All right, all right,
all right.

693
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,938
Goddamn it.

694
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:55,108
What is the matter with you?

695
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:59,696
I might as well tell you the whole mess, Fanny. What?

696
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:05,743
It wasn't just Bucky's money.
I spent that all weeks ago.

697
00:45:05,828 --> 00:45:08,705
I needed some more,
so I, uh‒

698
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,251
I had to borrow
from the boys, and, uh‒

699
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:16,879
Well, that's gone too.

700
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,385
If they don't get it back,
they're going to build me into the Westside Highway.

701
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,846
That's the only good news
I've heard all night.

702
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,724
I'm not kidding.
I'm not either.

703
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:30,810
I'm into them bad. I mean,
they're gonna come for me.

704
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:35,815
Oh, God. They're gonna come for me.
They're gonna come for me.

705
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:38,234
You borrowed show money
with no backup?

706
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:43,990
Yep.
You must be smoky in the head.

707
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,326
Look, you gotta help me.
Please.

708
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,579
Look, I know
I can fix the show.

709
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:52,832
Please. Look, I can fix it.
Give it to me.

710
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,585
Bucky will come in for more if I match
him and if you stay with the show.

711
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,296
I know I can fix it. We take it
on the road, and we fix it.

712
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:02,425
What happened tonight... That was mostly my fault.
You were right about everything.

713
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,427
The props, the sets,
the costumes‒ Charles.

714
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,263
Charles, everything.
But the songs are good.

715
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:10,892
I'm gonna get some dancers from
the Cotton Club to back up Bert.

716
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:14,395
The sketches‒ They're good.
They're swamped by your goddamn production.

717
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,732
Okay, you're right.
Teach me. Teach me.

718
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:21,068
I can learn anything,
and I can learn it faster than anybody.

719
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:24,447
You need a show.
You gonna start that again, you little putz?

720
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,449
I didn't mean it. I'm a star.
I don't need you.

721
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:30,620
It was a mistake.
Listen. Come on, Fanny.

722
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,705
Where are you gonna
get some more dough?

723
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,125
Same place
I got it before.

724
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:44,634
Why not? If you're gonna get knocked off,
you might as well do it for some good round sum.

725
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:48,012
Good girl. Come here.
Let me take a look at this. Ow!

726
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:50,056
I'm sorry.
What are you, nuts?

727
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,225
Why don't you
get some sleep?

728
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,770
What are you doing up?
It's 4:00 in the morning.

729
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,980
You must be crazy.
I'll tell you that.

730
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:00,066
Come on. Go to sleep.
Please. Give me the key.

731
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:02,068
Huh?
The key.

732
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,070
I'll return it.
Give me the key.

733
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,072
Here.

734
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,742
Thanks, huh?

735
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,787
Go to sleep.
Yeah, yeah.

736
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:17,458
It's 4:00.
Billy?

737
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,001
Huh?

738
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:24,006
You think you can get your friends to, uh,
take Charles for a ride?

739
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,184
Oy.

740
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,979
First you gotta
dump two-thirds of the set.

741
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,022
For God's sake,
simplify the orchestrations.

742
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:44,110
Let's start with the Spanish number.
Cut the moon, the gypsies and the lousy campfire.

743
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:01,586
Did you ever hear of "in one"?
"In one" means a curtain and me.

744
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:05,214
I come out,
and I'm Martha Graham.

745
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:19,729
You see, Billy,
in a tutu, I can be funny.

746
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:25,568

Hey, we're sold out.

819
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:07,391
All right,
let's make this the last one.

820
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:10,352
We're S.R.O. Tonight!

821
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,147
We're S.R.O. tomorrow night!
Hey!

822
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,191
We still have to take
a picture here. Finish up.

823
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,943
Here's a picture.
Come on. Please.

824
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,696
Stop it. Will you, please?
While I'm down here,

825
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,740
I want to drink celery tonic out of your shoe.

826
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,492
Not from this shoe. This is 45 bucks.
This is a custom-made shoe.

827
00:53:25,577 --> 00:53:27,912
She won't give me a custom-made shoe.
Give me something.

828
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:30,331
Give me a tooth.
Give me a nice tooth. Give me an ear.

829
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:33,584
Give me something. Give me a tooth.
You got a nice tooth?

830
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:36,879
Give me an earring.
Give me your hand.

831
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,840
Stop it. Get off the floor, you nut.
You're ruining your pants.

832
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,384
So, hey, it's a new act.
Brice and Rose.

833
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,428
We go through life together,
S.R.O. All the way.

834
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:47,014
You wanna stay S.R.O.,
you gotta do a job on the four-sheets.

835
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:50,226
You're not getting the best out of the four-sheets.
You want something you can see...

836
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:54,939
on an outhouse wall 200 yards from the highway,
going 60 miles an hour on a foggy night.

837
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,816
Yellow and black, no fine print.
All that matters is, can they see it?

838
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,319
Can they read it?
Can they remember it?

839
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:02,738
Yellow and black and plain,
you got it? Got it.

840
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:06,116
You're such a slob. Why do you drop
your pistachio shells all over the theater?

841
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:09,912
The theater is a temple of art.
I gave you some good advice, kid. I hope you got it.

842
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:13,207
I got it. When I got you,
I got it all. What are you, crazy?

843
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:17,127
What? Nobody can touch a star?
Huh? Stop that!

844
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,630
I don't like being handled.

845
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:23,592
Is that right?
Is that right? That's right.

846
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,678
Stop it!

847
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,849
Stop!

848
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:38,857
Oh, I am sorry.

849
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:42,820
I really am. I'm so sorry.
Billy, please.

850
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,905
Can I help you
brush your coat off?

851
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,783
I just grabbed
the first thing‒ Billy?

852
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:50,953
I just grabbed the first thing
that I‒ I grabbed the first thing.

00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:53,789

01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:06,513
"Why, Nick, how good
it is to see you."

936
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:11,560
You w-want a drink or something?
You want a cigarette?

937
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,979
I'll call Adele. What do you want?
What do you want?

938
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:18,066
I don't want a drink.
And I don't want Adele.

01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:19,169
Will you please explain to me why the hell I
can't remember one thing I was gonna say?

949
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:26,551
I'll remember my lines if I just don't have to look at you.

950
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:29,054
I'll remember.

951
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,306
Fanny, I want to
talk to you seriously.

952
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:35,393
No, you don't have any lines here.
It's my turn.

for divorcing me.

really had to dig yourself out.

959
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:07,634
I really can.

960
01:04:07,718 --> 01:04:10,846
But I want to get off, Nicky.

961
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:15,517
Oh, Nick. I just want to
climb into your back pocket...

962
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,769
and stay there all the time.

963
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:22,232

967
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:55,307

Oh, oh, oh, oh, uh‒

1110
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:20,384
I got a little
confession to make.

1111
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:26,349
I never borrowed any money from
the mob like I told ya in Atlantic City.

1112
01:17:28,268 --> 01:17:33,105
You bastard.
Making me think they had ya on ice.

1113
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:40,613
Was a‒ Was a very good argument.
And you bought it.

1114
01:17:40,697 --> 01:17:45,910
Only by now you should know better.
And, uh,

1115
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:51,040
I wouldn't want you
to think you married dumb.

1116
01:17:58,965 --> 01:18:02,468
Watch the news, darling.
Fanny. Fanny.

1117
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:07,264
Oh-ha. Darling,
I do adore you.

1118
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:10,768
But you are absolutely mad.
Tell me, why him?

1119
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:15,940
I fell in like with him.

1120
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:19,026
Do you have a light?

1121
01:18:22,572 --> 01:18:24,740
Here.

1122
01:18:26,493 --> 01:18:30,162
Oh, did you see
what that man did?

1123
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:36,544
Well, here's to her third husband,
whoever he is.

1124
01:18:36,628 --> 01:18:39,171
I've been to
the other two weddings.

1125
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:44,051
I beg your pardon.
It is rather a crush. My wife, however,

1126
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:47,638
is determined to navigate the length
of the room and speak to Miss Brice.

1127
01:18:47,723 --> 01:18:49,890
Good luck.
Do you know her?

1128
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:53,644
I married her. Oh, yes,
of course. You must be Mr.‒

1129
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:58,733
Rose. Billy Rose.
Rose.

1130
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:03,904
Well‒ Crude little bastard,
isn't he?

1131
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:07,825
Screw him, darling.
He's only in on a pass.

1132
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:15,666
Have a nice evening,
Mr. Brice. Rose.

1133
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,673
No action in the club car?

1134
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:27,428
How many times I gotta tell
you that I am not a gambler?

1135
01:19:27,512 --> 01:19:29,472
How many times I gotta
tell ya that?

1136
01:19:34,269 --> 01:19:38,272
Did you do your knees yet?
No, I'm coming to them.

1137
01:19:38,356 --> 01:19:40,691
I thought you did your knees before you did your heels.

1138
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:46,280
No. I do the heels first.
Then I do the knees.

1139
01:19:46,364 --> 01:19:48,532
Every night?
Every night.

1140
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:50,534
Every night.

1141
01:19:54,831 --> 01:19:58,125
You know, by the time
you finish that production,

1142
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:00,920
I get all mixed up.
Mixed up what?

1143
01:20:01,004 --> 01:20:04,048
Oh, mixed up. I don't know
what I'm supposed to go for.

1144
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:07,802
I figure maybe‒ Jesus,
maybe there's something I don't know about.

1145
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:10,638
Like, uh, maybe I'm supposed
to go do something...

1146
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:14,225
to your goddamn knees or heels or something.
I don't know.

1147
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:25,444
You put perfume
behind your knees?

1148
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,696
You never did that before.
Yes, I did.

1149
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:34,245
Maybe I'm right.
I'm supposed to go for your knees, right?

1150
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:36,831
Will you forget
about the knees?

1151
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:39,708
We're gonna arrive in Fort Worth at 7:00 in the morning.

1152
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:43,128
Let's get some sleep.
Some sleep.

1153
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:54,098
The heels before the knees.
The knees after the heels, before the elbows.

1154
01:20:57,018 --> 01:21:00,020
After the knees.

1155
01:21:48,653 --> 01:21:50,571
Hang up your pants, Billy.

1156
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:55,075
You're gonna get into Fort Worth looking like two bits.

1157
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,245
- I'll get 'em pressed.
- Why pay a buck to get 'em pressed...

1158
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:00,956
when all you have to do
is hang them up?

1159
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:09,840
Did Nick always
hang up his pants?

1160
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:14,762
Yes.
I'll pay the buck.

1161
01:22:16,431 --> 01:22:19,975
Flinging your clothes all over the
room makes it look like a dump.

1162
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:24,229
So I never been in a train for
three days with goddamn royalty!

1163
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:26,440
Here!

1164
01:22:29,319 --> 01:22:34,615
Hey, how come you
never go to the can?

1165
01:22:34,699 --> 01:22:37,242
When we were in the theater,
you used to go to the can.

1166
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:39,370
It's none of your damn business when I go to the can.

1167
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:42,539
How come now we're married,
and we're cooped up here for three days,

1168
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:45,626
and you never
go to the can?

1169
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:50,130
How do you think I feel being cooped up
and having to go to the can all the time?

1170
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:52,257
Listen, kid, you don't like
being cooped up with me?

1171
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:54,301
There's an empty compartment
down the car‒ Hire it!

1172
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:56,845
You can spend the whole
goddamn night in the can!

1173
01:22:56,930 --> 01:23:00,391
And I won't have to look at your crummy
pajamas anymore, which is okay with me!

1174
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:03,394
What's wrong with my goddamn pajamas?
I hate your pajamas!

1175
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:06,897
Ya got terrible pajamas!
Well, I hate‒

1176
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,149
I hate your lemons!

1177
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:14,321
And I hate‒ I hate
your fancy bed junk!

1178
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,323
And where‒ where‒

1179
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:19,910
Where‒ tell me where‒
Where do you come off...

1180
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:23,831
reading a goddamn French
magazine on our honeymoon?

1181
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:25,916
And I know you can't even
read French!

1182
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:29,169
I look at the pictures, creep!
I learn what's good and what goes!

1183
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:32,339
I'll tell you one thing that'll never go,
and that is your pajamas!

1184
01:23:32,424 --> 01:23:36,677
Screw my pajamas. Screw 'em!
Screw 'em, and screw you, lady!

1185
01:23:36,761 --> 01:23:39,263
And I‒

1186
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:43,642
What?
Oh, God.

1187
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:45,644
What's the matter?

1188
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:50,774
You gave me a nosebleed.
You gave me a goddamn nosebleed.

1189
01:24:00,285 --> 01:24:03,954
Hold it. Hold it, till I get some ice.
Here. Give me‒

1190
01:24:08,918 --> 01:24:10,919
Okay, here.

1191
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:16,550
Now if you bleed
on my good gown‒

1192
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:19,595
When I stop bleeding,
I'm gonna belt you one. You got one coming.

1193
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:21,889
Yeah, sure.
You're going‒

1194
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:24,224
Tough guy.

1195
01:24:26,811 --> 01:24:29,146
Boy, kid,
you are some nut.

1196
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:34,651
Let me see.

1197
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:45,162
Ahh.
Just lie still.

1198
01:24:45,246 --> 01:24:47,873
You know the trouble, Fanny?

1199
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:52,503
The trouble is
that I love ya.

1200
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:54,755
I love ya.

1201
01:24:58,510 --> 01:25:00,928
You could have told me
before, you know?

1202
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:05,390

Billy— Billy— Shirley,
will you get me that clipping, please?

1254
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:03,795
Will you let me read it to you
first and then blow your stack?

1255
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:08,467
Okay? Okay.
Shirley?

1256
01:29:08,551 --> 01:29:13,180
"Miracle man of Broadway Billy Rose's
beauteous aquabella Eleanor Holm...

1257
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:15,807
"is singing Circe songs
to Billy out in Cleveland.

1258
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:19,436
"Are you listening, Billy? And, Fanny,
are you listening to Billy listening?

1259
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,522
Five years, five hits.
Is this your first miss, Billy?"

1260
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:24,775
Burn it.

1261
01:29:24,859 --> 01:29:28,487
No, no, no, I can't kill a Winchell item.
You know that.

1262
01:29:28,571 --> 01:29:32,240
What I can do is prevent anybody else
from picking it up and running with it!

1263
01:29:32,325 --> 01:29:35,702
That's what I can do!
All right! Put it on the chair.

1264
01:29:35,787 --> 01:29:37,704
Don't tell me.

1265
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:40,457
You think I don't know how sore
she's gonna be when she finds out?

1266
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:42,667
I'm the one close enough
for her to grab.

1267
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:46,671
The proof's here.
His name should be in another color.

1268
01:29:46,756 --> 01:29:50,550
Billy, what can I do? Hey, Ned,
did you order a corned beef sandwich?

1269
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:55,013
Yes. Listen, you and Fanny wave hello,
good-bye to each other...

1270
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:57,557
every six months‒
from separate trains.

1271
01:29:57,642 --> 01:30:00,685
How can I publicize that?
What do you want me to do?

1272
01:30:00,770 --> 01:30:03,063
You want me to stage
something on the tracks,

1273
01:30:03,147 --> 01:30:06,858
where she flings your pipe and
slippers after you as you whiz by?

1274
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:09,903
He'll be with you right away.
Ned?

1275
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:13,532
Miss Brice. Hold it, Billy.
Fanny's on the other phone.

1276
01:30:13,616 --> 01:30:16,993
Tell him about the Hippodrome thing.
Okay.

1277
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:20,747
Hello, Fanny.
I'm just on the wire to Billy.

1278
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:23,375
He's lonely out there.
Ned wants me to tell you the accountant thinks...

1279
01:30:23,459 --> 01:30:26,211
you better put a watcher at the Hippodrome.
What?

1280
01:30:26,295 --> 01:30:28,255
Yes, I've seen the new poster.
What about it?

1281
01:30:28,339 --> 01:30:31,091
You wanna kill
the kid costume?

1282
01:30:31,175 --> 01:30:34,845
Okay, Fanny,
we get out a flood of releases that you also sing.

1283
01:30:34,929 --> 01:30:38,723
Big news, but if that's what you want,
you got it. Nothing simpler.

1284
01:30:38,808 --> 01:30:43,812
Okay. Hey, you want to talk to Billy?
Hold on a minute.

1285
01:30:43,896 --> 01:30:46,940
Hey, Billy, listen.
Talk to your wife for a minute, will ya?

1286
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:51,862
She's leaving for California tomorrow,
and she's worried, all right? Hold on.

1287
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:54,364
Okay, go ahead.

1288
01:30:54,449 --> 01:30:56,366
What are you worried?
You'll knock 'em dead.

1289
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:58,952
I wish you were here.
I could use your advice.

1290
01:30:59,036 --> 01:31:01,663
I wish you were here.
I could use your advice.

1291
01:31:01,747 --> 01:31:05,125
What about? Circe songs?
Listen, Fanny...

1292
01:31:05,209 --> 01:31:07,794
Don't you listen, kid.
Put cotton in your ears.

1293
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:10,881
Okay.
Billy, Fran sends you her love.

1294
01:31:10,965 --> 01:31:13,675
Give her my love. You, too, Fanny.
You know what I mean?

1295
01:31:13,759 --> 01:31:16,970
Sure, sure, sure.
Why don't you hang up and let me talk to Ned?

1296
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:19,973
Bye, Fanny. Good luck.
Bye, Billy. Ned?

1297
01:31:20,057 --> 01:31:25,020
Yes? Yeah, Fanny.
What can I do for you?

1298
01:31:25,104 --> 01:31:28,440
Your California train?
Oh, yeah.

1299
01:31:28,524 --> 01:31:32,319
If it doesn't go through Cleveland,
it's gotta go someplace near.

1300
01:31:32,403 --> 01:31:36,072
You want me to check that out for you?
Sure, just a minute. Hold on.

1301
01:31:36,157 --> 01:31:38,283
No, no, honey.
It's my pleasure.

1302
01:31:43,664 --> 01:31:45,665
Billy!

1303
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,792
Billy!

1304
01:31:49,629 --> 01:31:52,506
Be careful.
Be careful, girls.

1305
01:31:52,590 --> 01:31:55,675
That's beautiful.
What are you gonna do? Fly?

1306
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,845
No, no.
Okay, girls.

1307
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:02,098
Okay, Mr. Rose. Let's go.

1308
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:05,519
It's about time.
Will you get all the pe‒

1309
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:10,774
What the‒ I thought you were in
California with the radio show.

1310
01:32:10,858 --> 01:32:14,778
I thought you were in Cleveland by yourself.
Introduce me.

1311
01:32:14,862 --> 01:32:17,447
Oh, sure. This is the champ.
This is Eleanor Holm.

1312
01:32:17,532 --> 01:32:20,700
How do you do, Miss Brice?
Why don't you call me Mrs. Rose?

1313
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:24,037
Well, as long as she doesn't call me Mr.
Brice.

1314
01:32:24,121 --> 01:32:26,540
No, seriously.
What are you doing here in Cleveland?

1315
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:28,959
My train passed through, you know.
When it stopped, I got off.

1316
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:32,045
I figured I'd check him out.
How's it going?

1317
01:32:32,129 --> 01:32:34,089
Places, everybody!
Excuse me. Back to work.

1318
01:32:34,173 --> 01:32:36,550
Right. Dress.

1319
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:40,637
I mean,
it's such a terrific break th-that you showed up here.

1320
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:43,014
We're gonna do a dress.
You couldn't have timed it any better.

1321
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:46,560
I really think I got a hit.
I just feel it. Yeah?

1322
01:32:46,644 --> 01:32:49,771
One hell of a show. I'd like to see what you think.
Any advice you could give me‒

1323
01:32:49,855 --> 01:32:52,065
I'll give it.

1324
01:32:52,149 --> 01:32:55,402
You look‒ I mean,
that's terrific. Just terrific.

1325
01:32:55,486 --> 01:32:58,738
I mean, I love that suit.
You should. It cost you 200 bucks.

1326
01:32:58,823 --> 01:33:02,659
Mr. Rose, we need you up there!
Um‒

1327
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:06,580
It's all right. Go ahead.
Don't worry about me. Yeah?

1328
01:33:06,664 --> 01:33:10,000
Terrific. Come here.
Sit here.

1329
01:33:10,084 --> 01:33:13,086
You'll be all right?
I'll see ya in a while. Yeah, fine.

1330
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:17,424
Clowns into the dressing room.
Terrific.

1331
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:21,678
Hit the music.

1332
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:25,265
Stand by.
Lights!

1333
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:28,893
Hit the special!

1334
01:34:05,014 --> 01:34:09,934
Presenting the Billy Rose Aquaville!

1335
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:58,108
Give me a little
celery tonic.

1336
01:35:00,444 --> 01:35:05,782
Billy Rose's new star,
Miss Eleanor Holm.

1337
01:36:17,813 --> 01:36:20,148
That's great, Billy.
That's terrific!

1338
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:40,794
Yahhh!

1339
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:47,133
Whoo!

1340
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:49,219
Surprise!
What are you doing?

1341
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:55,767
Hey, come here.
You wanna dance?

1342
01:36:55,851 --> 01:36:58,686
♪ Da-da-da ♪

1343
01:36:59,730 --> 01:37:03,233
Hey! Yoo-hoo!

1344
01:37:15,913 --> 01:37:18,081
Hey!

1345
01:37:18,165 --> 01:37:21,000
Wait! No!

1346
01:37:23,587 --> 01:37:25,380
Ha-haa!

1347
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:30,802
Hi!

1348
01:37:35,516 --> 01:37:39,519
Your star trout's
got a lot of muscle.

1349
01:37:39,603 --> 01:37:44,566
Don't let her get you in the water.
Eleanor's a great kid.

1350
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:48,528
You oughta get to know her.

1351
01:37:48,612 --> 01:37:52,156
Maybe we should have her
for dinner... amandine.

1352
01:37:54,952 --> 01:37:57,954
I just made a joke.

1353
01:37:59,164 --> 01:38:02,542
You didn't think it was funny?
No, kidding.

1354
01:38:02,626 --> 01:38:06,754
You got a great show...
with an ace attraction.

1355
01:38:06,839 --> 01:38:09,007
Ace.

1356
01:38:09,091 --> 01:38:12,594
You shouldn't kid a kidder, Fanny. What?

1357
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:17,223
You performed
for me tonight.

1358
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:20,226
I performed for you?
What is that supposed to mean?

1359
01:38:20,311 --> 01:38:24,856
Well, I know you.

1360
01:38:24,940 --> 01:38:28,818
I know how you think.

1361
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:33,197
You figure you want something,
the best way to go about gettin' it is be funny.

1362
01:38:33,282 --> 01:38:35,408
I've seen you
do that before.

1363
01:38:35,492 --> 01:38:37,535
Oh, yeah?

1364
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:43,249
Yeah.
You went to a lot of trouble to make me laugh tonight.

1365
01:38:43,334 --> 01:38:46,544
You've got a very primitive sense of humor.
Know what I mean?

1366
01:38:46,629 --> 01:38:51,799
Pratfalls, dropped drawers,
drowning bits.

1367
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:57,805
You know, I got a‒
I got a terrific idea.

1368
01:38:57,890 --> 01:39:01,434
I mean, I don't know if it would work,
but see what you think.

1369
01:39:01,518 --> 01:39:05,063
What's on your mind, kid?

1370
01:39:05,147 --> 01:39:08,775
Why don't we get married?

1371
01:39:08,859 --> 01:39:14,030
We got married.

1372
01:39:16,867 --> 01:39:21,871
Well, I mean, uh,
really be married. Really married.

1373
01:39:23,707 --> 01:39:29,212
Mrs. Rose is the name. Chicken soup is the game.
Is that what you want?

1374
01:39:44,895 --> 01:39:47,897
What I want is‒

1375
01:39:50,275 --> 01:39:55,989
I want you to do more...
of what you did tonight.

1376
01:39:56,073 --> 01:40:00,743
Brush off a broad if you think she's getting too close.

1377
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:07,458
You remember a...
long time ago...

1378
01:40:07,543 --> 01:40:10,753
you made me say
"I need you"?

1379
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:13,172
Hmm?

1380
01:40:15,384 --> 01:40:18,219
Well, that's what I want.

1381
01:40:20,389 --> 01:40:24,726
I want you to need me.
I mean, really need me.

1382
01:40:32,776 --> 01:40:35,945
Need me.

1383
01:40:42,411 --> 01:40:46,998
You got some
sexy ears, honey.

1384
01:40:47,082 --> 01:40:50,418
I think I'll stick
diamonds in 'em.

1385
01:40:53,047 --> 01:40:55,381
Hmm?

1386
01:41:10,689 --> 01:41:12,482
I need you.

1387
01:41:14,526 --> 01:41:16,360
I need you.

1388
01:41:18,947 --> 01:41:21,783
I need you.

1389
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:32,668
Life, Collier's, Esquire‒

1390
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:38,591
Stage‒ what is this?
The Saturday Evening Post. More?

1391
01:41:38,675 --> 01:41:41,385
Sure.
Now, you shouldn't get bored and pick up strange men.

1392
01:41:41,470 --> 01:41:43,763
Are there any other kind?

1393
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:50,603
Listen, Billy. Will you call me every night?
Reverse the charges if you want.

1394
01:41:50,687 --> 01:41:54,273
Don't be a chump.
I got a new system for beating the phone company.

1395
01:41:54,358 --> 01:41:58,111
First you place a call in the
city of your choice‒ All aboard.

1396
01:41:58,195 --> 01:42:00,446
I'm a mess, huh?

1397
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:03,574
You're fine.

1398
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:08,496
All aboard.
Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles!

1399
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:14,252
I'm gonna get ya a bigger ring.

1400
01:42:14,336 --> 01:42:17,922
All right.
So long, Billy.

1401
01:42:18,006 --> 01:42:20,508
All aboard!

1402
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:25,805
Billy!
Huh?

1403
01:42:25,889 --> 01:42:28,808
Don't go near the water.

1404
01:42:35,232 --> 01:42:38,401
Norma,
I canceled the Baby Snooks rehearsal to come here?

1405
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:41,487
Come on, Fanny.

1406
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:44,866
What is this, a costume party?
I get paid for wearing costumes.

1407
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:46,868
Stop "quetching."
Kvetching.

1408
01:42:46,952 --> 01:42:49,495
Kvetching. Kvetching.
You're gonna just love it.

1409
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:51,789
We got seats right next to the field.
You're gonna love it.

1410
01:42:51,874 --> 01:42:54,625
Heigh-ho, Silverstein, right?
Right.

1411
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,295
Oh, Fanny.

1412
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:01,507
So this is Beverly Hills.

1413
01:43:03,051 --> 01:43:05,803
You can't catch up
with the goyim.

1414
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:08,222
Just when you think you've
learned it all‒ grape scissors‒

1415
01:43:08,307 --> 01:43:10,558
they come at you with shooting sticks and "hukkas."

1416
01:43:10,642 --> 01:43:13,769
Chukkas. Chukkas.
Chukkas?

1417
01:43:16,315 --> 01:43:19,525
Oh, I wish
Billy was here.

1418
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:21,611
Billy loves baloney.

1419
01:43:43,675 --> 01:43:48,638
Take it. - When Norma promises
you'll be excited, you'll be excited.

1420
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:54,977
Do you know Nick?
Nick?

1421
01:43:55,062 --> 01:43:58,731
Oh, Fanny, you don't think
I planned anything, do you?

1422
01:43:58,815 --> 01:44:03,027
He just was here, and‒ Norma,
thank God you never had to learn to act.

1423
01:44:05,113 --> 01:44:08,157
What I want to know is,
does he know I'm here?

1424
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:11,661
Well, I'm absolutely certain
he'd want to.

1425
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:20,711
I'll see you kids later.
I'll send the car back. Enjoy the game.

1426
01:44:27,344 --> 01:44:30,930
Oh, come on. Quit while you're ahead.
Your finale is great.

1427
01:44:31,014 --> 01:44:34,475
Don't try to walk
on the water, kid.

1428
01:44:34,559 --> 01:44:39,272
Why don't you come on out here?
I'll send you a ticket. I'll send you a return ticket.

1429
01:44:39,356 --> 01:44:42,191
You want a private car?
I'll give my body to Huntington Hartford.

1430
01:44:42,276 --> 01:44:45,987
Come on. How about it?
What do you say?

1431
01:44:50,867 --> 01:44:53,452
No, no. I'm okay.

1432
01:44:53,537 --> 01:44:57,957
No. I really am.
I just miss you, kid, that's all.

1433
01:45:00,377 --> 01:45:04,213
Look, if I get too lonely,
I'll send for Fran, right?

1434
01:45:05,841 --> 01:45:08,092
Yeah. Sure.

1435
01:45:10,178 --> 01:45:14,515
No. Don't be silly.
Of course I understand.

1436
01:45:16,393 --> 01:45:20,896
I'll talk to you next week, huh?
Maybe sooner.

1437
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:24,358
Sure.

1438
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:28,487
Me too.

1439
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:34,577

01:48:45,727 --> 01:48:47,770
How are ya, kid?

1471
01:48:49,356 --> 01:48:53,651
I'm not sure.
A little nervous, I think.

1472
01:48:53,735 --> 01:48:56,862
Me too.

1473
01:48:56,947 --> 01:49:00,533
Like always.

1474
01:49:00,617 --> 01:49:04,620
You ever think about directing movies?
You already got the wardrobe.

1475
01:49:08,291 --> 01:49:12,628
- You look ravishing, old girl.
- You look ravishing too.

1476
01:49:15,173 --> 01:49:18,092
What's the matter?
You didn't have time to change out of your polo clothes?

1477
01:49:18,176 --> 01:49:23,931
Yes, I had plenty of time.
I tried to decide what I should wear.

1478
01:49:24,015 --> 01:49:28,561
And I looked in the mirror and saw
how becoming this outfit was.

1479
01:49:28,645 --> 01:49:33,065
So I just took a shower and put on more of the same.
I thought I might get by with it.

1480
01:49:33,149 --> 01:49:36,819
You picked up a new trick‒
telling the truth.

1481
01:49:53,420 --> 01:49:56,422
What are you thinking?

1482
01:49:57,674 --> 01:49:59,633
I was just remembering...

1483
01:50:02,846 --> 01:50:06,223
when I first
went out with you.

1484
01:50:06,308 --> 01:50:09,518
I was still living
home with Mama.

1485
01:50:09,603 --> 01:50:12,521
I used to sleep
in the same bed with her,

1486
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:16,859
and once,
in the middle of the night,

1487
01:50:16,943 --> 01:50:19,862
I woke up kissing her.

1488
01:50:19,946 --> 01:50:22,865
And she woke up and said,
"This ain't Nick."

1489
01:50:24,534 --> 01:50:27,911
That's what I was thinking.

1490
01:50:33,501 --> 01:50:36,462
How is your mother?

1491
01:50:36,546 --> 01:50:40,090
She sold the saloons. She
lives in Lakewood, New Jersey.

1492
01:50:40,175 --> 01:50:42,718
She likes Billy.

1493
01:50:42,802 --> 01:50:45,554
Ah, yes. Mr. Rose.

1494
01:50:48,725 --> 01:50:50,684
How is Mr. Rose?

1495
01:50:52,145 --> 01:50:54,897
He keeps busy.

1496
01:50:54,981 --> 01:50:58,150
How about you? I mean,
when you come down off your horse?

1497
01:50:58,234 --> 01:51:01,153
Well, when I come down off my horse,
there's the yacht...

1498
01:51:01,237 --> 01:51:04,490
and a 13th-century palazzo,

1499
01:51:04,574 --> 01:51:08,869
which we're pulling apart stone by
stone and rebuilding in Cap d'Antibes.

1500
01:51:08,953 --> 01:51:13,666
- The problems of dismantling are just staggering.
- But I've always liked...

1501
01:51:13,750 --> 01:51:17,252
dismantling much better than "mantling."

1502
01:51:17,337 --> 01:51:20,798
- Still the same old Fanny.
- You expecting Mrs. Roosevelt?

1503
01:51:20,882 --> 01:51:25,803
I was expecting Fanny.
Hoping for Fanny.

1504
01:51:29,599 --> 01:51:35,145
You know, Fanny,
the only trouble we had was money.

1505
01:51:35,230 --> 01:51:38,273
That's not a problem now.

1506
01:51:38,358 --> 01:51:41,276
No problem for you,
or no problem for your wife?

1507
01:51:42,821 --> 01:51:45,197
No problem for either of us.

1508
01:51:45,281 --> 01:51:48,367
If I walk away, I walk away
with a very large stake.

1509
01:51:56,835 --> 01:51:59,795
How you fixed
for toothbrushes, kid?

1510
01:52:03,842 --> 01:52:05,801
Oh, God.

1511
01:52:08,471 --> 01:52:12,599
I remember that first time
in Baltimore,

1512
01:52:15,061 --> 01:52:18,856
when I went up
to your hotel room.

1513
01:52:20,984 --> 01:52:24,027
And I went
into your bathroom.

1514
01:52:27,741 --> 01:52:30,951
Jesus. You
had seven toothbrushes.

1515
01:52:32,787 --> 01:52:36,582
Seven. I guess one
for every day in the week.

1516
01:52:36,666 --> 01:52:41,336
And you had this big wooden bowl with soap in it.

1517
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:48,051
"By appointment to His Majesty,"
it says on the bowl.

1518
01:52:48,136 --> 01:52:51,305
Phew. Royal soap.

1519
01:52:51,389 --> 01:52:55,350
And hanging on the door
were these silk pajamas,

1520
01:52:55,435 --> 01:52:59,730
red, with a monogram,

1521
01:52:59,814 --> 01:53:02,983
real tiny, tiny.

1522
01:53:04,194 --> 01:53:06,403
That small.

1523
01:53:09,699 --> 01:53:13,202
Class. Phew.

1524
01:53:15,163 --> 01:53:18,874
Boy, did I come out of that bathroom with personality.
I mean‒

1525
01:53:21,377 --> 01:53:23,545
I was all over the place.

1526
01:53:27,091 --> 01:53:30,761
Because I fell in love
with those toothbrushes.

1527
01:53:50,573 --> 01:53:53,700
I still have
seven toothbrushes, Fanny.

1528
01:54:36,119 --> 01:54:39,079
And all these years...

1529
01:54:41,249 --> 01:54:44,209
I've been in love
with nothing but a set...

1530
01:54:44,294 --> 01:54:47,754
of goddamn toothbrushes.

1531
01:54:53,011 --> 01:54:56,722
You have a daughter,
you know.

1532
01:54:56,806 --> 01:55:00,434
You haven't seen her
in six years.

1533
01:55:00,518 --> 01:55:04,938
And you don't even think to ask about her.
You ask about Mama, Mr. Rose.

1534
01:55:05,023 --> 01:55:09,192
But you don't remember to inquire about
your own daughter, you son of a bitch.

1535
01:55:11,988 --> 01:55:14,907
How is Fran?

1536
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:18,869
She's great.
She keeps your picture next to her bed.

1537
01:55:20,705 --> 01:55:24,917
She does? Which one?
What do you care? They're all gorgeous.

1538
01:55:25,001 --> 01:55:29,338
Nick, the only trouble we had about money is
what you thought it could take the place of.

1539
01:55:29,422 --> 01:55:32,090
If you'll excuse me,
I have to go.

1540
01:55:32,175 --> 01:55:36,929
Bobby, say hi to Nick
before he goes.

1541
01:55:40,099 --> 01:55:43,602

This is WIXY, Cleveland.
Here's Shep Fields...

1591
01:59:39,881 --> 01:59:43,175
and his ripplin' rhythm
with one of your favorites.

1592
02:00:01,569 --> 02:00:05,071
Billy?
Miss Brice!

1593
02:00:05,156 --> 02:00:08,617
Jesus. Fanny.

1594
02:00:12,038 --> 02:00:15,207
So just don't lay there,
honey. Swim something.

1595
02:01:03,798 --> 02:01:06,883
You always were
a fast dresser.

1596
02:01:06,968 --> 02:01:09,719
Sloppy, but fast.

1597
02:01:13,391 --> 02:01:15,392
Fix your tie.

1598
02:01:21,107 --> 02:01:23,024
Can I sit down?

1599
02:01:24,110 --> 02:01:26,027
Yeah. Sit.

1600
02:01:32,827 --> 02:01:34,744
So.

1601
02:01:35,830 --> 02:01:37,872
Alone at last.

1602
02:01:41,585 --> 02:01:44,212
That was like a crummy
burlesque sketch.

1603
02:01:48,259 --> 02:01:51,761
I'm sorry, Fanny.
I'm sorry.

1604
02:01:56,017 --> 02:02:00,228
You know,
I flew all the way to Cleveland in a plane.

1605
02:02:02,732 --> 02:02:06,568
I had to get here fast so I could tell you my big news.

1606
02:02:09,030 --> 02:02:11,197
What news?

1607
02:02:11,282 --> 02:02:14,034
I should've phoned.

1608
02:02:15,077 --> 02:02:17,329
What news?

1609
02:02:24,587 --> 02:02:27,547
I wanted to be with you
when I told you.

1610
02:02:29,300 --> 02:02:32,093
It's all over with Nick.

1611
02:02:33,387 --> 02:02:37,015
I mean it. Really over.

1612
02:02:37,099 --> 02:02:41,603
Look, Billy. It's okay.

1613
02:02:43,230 --> 02:02:47,400
See, I figured what happened is
because I called you from L.A.,

1614
02:02:47,485 --> 02:02:49,444
and I told you
I wanted to see Nick.

1615
02:02:49,528 --> 02:02:53,531
And you got sore at me, right?
You figured, you know, screw her.

1616
02:02:54,909 --> 02:02:57,702
And I don't blame you.
I don't blame you. I mean it.

1617
02:02:57,787 --> 02:03:01,289
I don't blame you.
You're entitled.

1618
02:03:03,417 --> 02:03:06,753
So let's negotiate.

1619
02:03:06,837 --> 02:03:10,965
I'm willing to forget it if
you're willing to forget it.

1620
02:03:11,050 --> 02:03:13,385
Fair?

1621
02:03:19,475 --> 02:03:21,434
I'm in trouble, right?

1622
02:03:27,733 --> 02:03:29,901
You really go
for the trout?

1623
02:03:31,237 --> 02:03:34,114
I go for her, Fanny.

1624
02:03:35,658 --> 02:03:38,785
She got a good shape.
What else?

1625
02:03:43,833 --> 02:03:48,128
To her, I'm Nick.

1626
02:03:52,341 --> 02:03:56,094
Oh. Do you love her?

1627
02:03:58,389 --> 02:04:01,099
I don't know.

1628
02:04:01,183 --> 02:04:04,018
I suppose so.

1629
02:04:05,146 --> 02:04:07,689
She loves me.

1630
02:04:13,362 --> 02:04:15,655
Well, that's it then.

1631
02:04:15,739 --> 02:04:20,160
If you love her,
there's nothing to discuss.

1632
02:04:20,244 --> 02:04:25,623
Listen, I'd make a clean exit,
but my train doesn't leave for another hour,

1633
02:04:25,708 --> 02:04:29,377
and I have to hang around here,
so you'd better check out.

1634
02:04:44,143 --> 02:04:46,352
See ya in court, kid.

1635
02:04:58,741 --> 02:05:01,659
Good luck, Fanny. I‒

1636
02:05:04,997 --> 02:05:07,582
Good luck, Billy.

1637
02:05:18,886 --> 02:05:22,972
Daddy,
I know how we can settle this whole thing right now.

1638
02:05:23,057 --> 02:05:26,184
How?

02:06:49,685 --> 02:06:52,937
Hmm?
It sure has.

1649
02:07:00,321 --> 02:07:03,281
So, how do you
think I look?

1650
02:07:04,408 --> 02:07:07,118
Tah-dah.

1651
02:07:07,202 --> 02:07:09,954
You look, uh‒ you look sensational.
You look great.

1652
02:07:10,039 --> 02:07:12,957
Thanks, kid.

1653
02:07:13,042 --> 02:07:15,668
Why don't you‒

1654
02:07:21,050 --> 02:07:26,346
So, how much did she take you for?
Oh. I can afford it.

1655
02:07:27,514 --> 02:07:32,226
Besides, the lady
had a legitimate beef.

1656
02:07:32,311 --> 02:07:35,980
You don't know your lines.
What am I supposed to say?

1657
02:07:36,065 --> 02:07:39,317
That Eleanor's a bitch,
and you've never seen me like this.

1658
02:07:39,401 --> 02:07:42,570
Seen you like what?

1659
02:07:42,655 --> 02:07:44,656
Like I am,
you jerk-pervert!

1660
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:49,577
Oh! But I have.
I've seen you like that.

1661
02:07:50,746 --> 02:07:55,083
I mean, to me,
you always were perfect.

1662
02:07:58,587 --> 02:08:01,673
- So what'll you drink?
- Uh, celery tonic.

1663
02:08:01,757 --> 02:08:05,343
Celery tonic.
How's—

1664
02:08:08,347 --> 02:08:11,391
- How's Fran?
- Grown up.

1665
02:08:11,475 --> 02:08:14,435
Gorgeous. Married.

1666
02:08:15,771 --> 02:08:18,773
Thanks for asking, kid.

1667
02:08:19,942 --> 02:08:23,611
You're still good company, Billy. Yeah?

1668
02:08:29,702 --> 02:08:32,078
Well.

1669
02:08:32,162 --> 02:08:36,374
I mean, if I was such good company,
how come we were never alone?

1670
02:08:36,458 --> 02:08:40,169

You used it in Cleveland.

Oh. Let's not
rehash Cleveland.

1693
02:10:25,901 --> 02:10:28,486

on celery tonic?

1694
02:10:28,570 --> 02:10:31,989
Oh, I took your advice.
I bought that company.

1695
02:10:32,074 --> 02:10:35,326
Now I make two cents
while I enjoy.

1696
02:10:35,410 --> 02:10:38,037
Oh, Billy,
I gotta hand it to you.

1697
02:10:38,121 --> 02:10:41,833
You got everything
you ever went out for.

1698
02:10:41,917 --> 02:10:44,961
But tell me something.

1699
02:10:46,129 --> 02:10:49,507
You really have
as much money as they say?

1700
02:10:49,591 --> 02:10:55,096
All it takes to make a lot of money is a lot of money.

1701
02:10:55,180 --> 02:10:58,683
The problem is what to do with it.
I don't worry about you, kid.

1702
02:10:58,767 --> 02:11:02,687
- You're resourceful.
- You know, Fanny,

1703
02:11:10,946 --> 02:11:13,698
I bought
the Ziegfeld Theater.

1704
02:11:13,782 --> 02:11:17,410
Really? Yeah.
The Ziegfeld. It's mine.

1705
02:11:17,494 --> 02:11:22,164
I'm gonna open up with the biggest show ever.
I mean, Salvador Dalí to do the sets.

1706
02:11:22,249 --> 02:11:25,376
Stokowski in the pit.
Music by Rodgers and Hammerstein.

1707
02:11:25,460 --> 02:11:30,631
Sketches by Kaufman and Hart. Costumes
designed in Paris. I mean, the best of everything.

1708
02:11:30,716 --> 02:11:35,553
Real Alencon lace
on the chorus girls' drawers.

1709
02:11:35,637 --> 02:11:38,598
That sounds great, Billy.
Who's gonna be in it?

1710
02:11:39,641 --> 02:11:43,060
Well, for openers, you.

1711
02:11:43,145 --> 02:11:46,731
Me? I knew
you were on the hustle.

1712
02:11:46,815 --> 02:11:50,443
Look, you haven't been on a stage in years.

1713
02:11:50,527 --> 02:11:54,071
You're sittin' out here doin' a farkakte
radio show season after season.

1714
02:11:54,156 --> 02:11:57,283
You're gettin' lazy.
You're a Ziegfeld star.

1715
02:11:57,367 --> 02:12:00,119
I mean,
the star of stars.

1716
02:12:00,203 --> 02:12:03,289
Come on. Name your figure.
I'll give you whatever you want.

1717
02:12:04,625 --> 02:12:07,752
I make a good living, kid.
I don't need the money.

1718
02:12:07,836 --> 02:12:11,756
Well, maybe not,
but you need me.

1719
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:14,759
You?
You I've had.

1720
02:12:17,721 --> 02:12:21,182
If you gotta get personal it's gonna
be a little south of complimentary,

1721
02:12:21,266 --> 02:12:24,185
but professionally,
I only helped you.

1722
02:12:24,269 --> 02:12:27,855
In the work department,
I was good for you, a good lift.

1723
02:12:29,524 --> 02:12:33,110
Come on. Let's
get together again, huh?

1724
02:12:35,697 --> 02:12:39,492
You know something?
My timing was always off for us.

1725
02:12:39,576 --> 02:12:42,787
It's too bad, really.
I just...

1726
02:12:42,871 --> 02:12:45,581
loused it all up.

1727
02:12:45,666 --> 02:12:49,043
Don't get such a swelled head.
I mean, you don't get all the credit.

1728
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:55,299
What do you say? "Billy Rose presents Fanny Brice."
I don't like the billing.

1729
02:12:55,384 --> 02:12:57,593
All right.
I'll‒ I'll think it over and I'll call you.

1730
02:12:57,678 --> 02:13:01,722
You'll think it over?
That's what you're sayin'? "I'll think it over"?

1731
02:13:01,807 --> 02:13:05,059
Billy, I haven't done anything
without thinking in over ten years.

1732
02:13:07,145 --> 02:13:12,566
You wanna know the truth?
I was rattled as hell, you comin' here tonight.

1733
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:19,407
I think what I wanted was for you to
come in here beggin' me to come back...

1734
02:13:19,491 --> 02:13:23,744
so I could have the pleasure of sayin' no.

1735
02:13:23,829 --> 02:13:27,164
It's taken me a long time
to learn how to say no.

1736
02:13:27,249 --> 02:13:30,793
I wanted a chance to practice.
That's what you're sayin' to me, no?

1737
02:13:30,877 --> 02:13:35,548
To me you're saying no? No.
I'm saying I'll think it over and call you.

1738
02:13:35,632 --> 02:13:38,843
Think fast. I don't wanna think fast.
That's the whole point.

1739
02:13:38,927 --> 02:13:41,679
No, the point is I'm at the Beverly Hills till noon,
day after tomorrow.

1740
02:13:41,763 --> 02:13:43,931
So yes or no,
no or yes, yes or no?

1741
02:13:44,016 --> 02:13:47,685
So I'll call you before noon day after tomorrow,
yes or no, no or yes, yes or no.

1742
02:14:05,078 --> 02:14:08,956
Make it yes. Rose and Brice.
Brice and Rose.

1743
02:14:09,041 --> 02:14:11,917
Rose and Brice.
Whatever.

1744
02:14:12,002 --> 02:14:16,380
We could
have a terrific time.

1745
02:14:28,727 --> 02:14:31,604
