1
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:59,008
It really thumps.

2
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:01,639
Honey, could you... could you
just put your hand up there?

3
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:04,596
Now hold it. That's right, because...

4
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,168
That's... That's...

5
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:42,638
Yeah?

6
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,594
What? Oh.

7
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,226
When'd you get back in town?

8
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,767
Uh-huh. Yeah?

9
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,228
Where are you staying?

10
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,438
Uh-huh.

11
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,821
Uh-huh.

12
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,902
Is she still in the same place?

13
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,158
Uh-huh.

14
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,199
Okay. Well, listen.

15
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,785
Uh, why don't you...
I-I'll call you tomorrow?

16
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,417
Or... Hey, why don't you
come by the shop and say hello?

17
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:13,923
Okay.

18
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:15,341
Okay. Bye.

19
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,301
I don't know why
you bother with them at all.

20
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,382
Tell them you're sleeping and hang up.

21
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,012
- Uh, I... I c...
- Hmm?

22
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:26,845
This girl has problems, you know.

23
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,750
- You know what your problem is?
- What?

24
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:31,391
- You know too many sick ladies.
- Oh, yeah?

25
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,569
Yeah. Particularly in your business.

26
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,776
Don't worry... honey.

27
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,449
'Cause I'm
gonna protect ya.

28
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,322
- Oh?
- Yeah.

29
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,496
Oh, look what I found.

30
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,665
Oh. Well...

31
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:50,619
Oh, shit!

32
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:57,042
Shit.

33
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,467
Yeah?

34
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,422
Uh, yeah, yeah.

35
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,882
Uh-huh.

36
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,591
What do you mean?

37
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,686
No, I...

38
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,264
Okay, all r...
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

39
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:15,227
I just don't know why you don't
get yourself an answering service.

40
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,312
All right.

41
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,194
What are you doing?

42
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,905
Um... looking for my keys.

43
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,749
Hmm?

44
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,751
Keys?

45
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,296
I thought you said
you weren't going anywhere.

46
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,125
I'm not. I just gotta see
this friend of mine for a few minutes.

47
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,631
What are you talking about?

48
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,742
It's one of those girls, isn't it?
You're going to see one of those girls.

49
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,930
What girl? She's not a girl.
She's just a friend of mine.

50
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,476
Wait!

51
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,271
At least wait till I'm dressed,
because I'm going too.

52
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,223
Aw...

53
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,934
Oh, Christ. Get me a Kleenex.

54
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,361
Look, Felicia, I-I won't be long.

55
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,385
- Listen, you're great, baby, believe me.
- Thanks a lot.

56
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,573
It's just that this girl's different, you know.
She has attacks.

57
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,780
- What attacks?
- These attacks.

58
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:12,458
It's got something to do
with her, uh, pancreas or...

59
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:15,036
Uh, I don't know... She's got a...

60
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,123
- Pancreatic ulcer?
- Yeah. Yeah. I think so.

61
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,253
- That's very serious.
- I know.

62
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,834
- Who's her doctor?
- I don't know.

63
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,045
- That's <i>very</i> serious.
- I know.

64
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:26,973
- Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
- She did?

65
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,471
- It turned out to be a cancer.
- Wow.

66
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:34,223
So what are you going for, George?
You're not a doctor.

67
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,228
No, no. I gotta give her some pills.

68
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,560
Uh, Percodan. She ran out.

69
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,397
Look, Felicia.

70
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,904
- I want your ass in this bed when I get back.
- You do?

71
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,201
- Yes.
- You're very weird, George.

72
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:51,452
Mmm, baby. But you're great, baby.
Believe me, you are great. Really.

73
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,249
- Why don't you take this off?
- Hmm.

74
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,496
Ouch!

75
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,331
Jesus Christ. Goddamn it.

76
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,793
Oh, shit.

77
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,427
- Who is it?
- Who do you think it is?

78
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,262
Oh.

79
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,688
- Honey.
- Yeah?

80
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,187
- Don't yell at me.
- I'm not yelling.

81
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:02,397
- There were some shots.
- What are you talking about?

82
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,937
Gunshots. Some gunshots.

83
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,273
- Where?
- Here.

84
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,155
In the canyon.

85
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,532
Well, it's a big canyon, honey.

86
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:13,988
So what?

87
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,074
A bullet can probably go miles.

88
00:06:22,299 --> 00:06:24,632
- Why do you leave me alone like this?
- Come on.

89
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,209
I've been running all over town,

90
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:28,573
trying to find out what they're going
to ask me at the bank tomorrow.

91
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,992
- You were home. Why didn't you call me?
- They shut off the phone.

92
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:34,009
I can't make outgoing calls.
Just breathe, honey.

93
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:43,355
Sometimes I get this terrible feeling...

94
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,570
that something awful's gonna happen.

95
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,443
Like what?

96
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,240
Well, I don't know. Like...

97
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,576
Like somebody's gonna get me.

98
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,862
Yeah?

99
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,537
I've had these dreams lately.

100
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,709
- What dreams?
- Well...

101
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,459
They're dumb, but, uh,

102
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,211
somebody gets me,

103
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,465
and they throw me around the room,
and I try to run away,

104
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,513
but they grab me and tie me down.

105
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,763
- Then what?
- Then I wake up.

106
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,310
Uh-huh.

107
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,309
Well, I don't know.

108
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,937
I-I figure if somebody's gonna get you,

109
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,144
it's, uh... you know,
it's probably gonna be me.

110
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:29,730
Oh! No!

111
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,656
No! No.

112
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,788
How are you, baby? Huh?

113
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,120
How are you?

114
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,090
Hmm.

115
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,650
Where were you?

116
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,356
I'm great, honey. Fantastic.

117
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,191
I really couldn't... couldn't be better.

118
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,402
- I mean, I'm really incredible.
- No.

119
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,408
- Incredible. I mean...
- No, where were you?

120
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,034
Huh?

121
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:23,163
I'm getting it together, baby.
I'm gonna open up the shop.

122
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:24,619
- Really?
- Yep.

123
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:29,002
You know, right now
I am at the epitome of my life.

124
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,279
- Yeah, well, what happened tonight?
- I don't want to talk about it now, honey.

125
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,215
But, you know,
I've been disgusted with my life.

126
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,048
But you just said
you were at the epitome of your life.

127
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,428
I am. I am.

128
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,430
Till I get Norman off my ass, you know...

129
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,058
When I got six guys cutting hair for me,
then I... You know.

130
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,811
I mean, after a while
women can get to be an occupational hazard.

131
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,187
What do you mean, "occupational hazard"?

132
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:52,989
You know, as long as I'm working in that shop,
I'm always gonna be doing too many heads.

133
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,901
- What about me?
- What about you?

134
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,078
- You're different.
- I am?

135
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,080
You're great.

136
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:05,334
- Do you really mean that?
- Hey.

137
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,036
I'm gonna retire with you.

138
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,882
- Honey.
- Yeah?

139
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:19,090
Why am I great?

140
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,800
Jesus, I don't know. You're great.

141
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,690
<i>I don't know. I just...</i>

142
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,272
You know what I read in <i>Cosmopolitan</i>?

143
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:38,700
That if you don't have a baby before you're 30,
you're gonna have a Mongolian idiot.

144
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:41,575
- <i>Here, take it!
- Oh! Up against the wall!</i>

145
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,451
- George?
- Bullshit.

146
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,994
Well, maybe you don't even like children.

147
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,205
- Never even been around one.
- Hey.

148
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,549
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?

149
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,172
- Huh?
- Yeah.

150
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,969
Yeah, okay.

151
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,968
Good night, honey.

152
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,593
- George?
- What?

153
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:07,688
Jackie says she wouldn't
bring children into this world,

154
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,266
that it's overpopulated and hypocritical.

155
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,771
Uh-huh.

156
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,524
Uh, could we talk about this
in the morning?

157
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:33,081
Jesus, let me show you something.

158
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,966
Six... Six and three-quarters.

159
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,260
- That's our prime rate.
- Really?

160
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,677
And I'll tell you something else.

161
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:45,635
- The big boys are going for it.
- Are they?

162
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,896
Do you know where FHA is?

163
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,059
- FHA? FHA?
- Just t-take a guess.

164
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:55,422
Just take a guess where they're at.

165
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,529
Well, seven and a half.

166
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,157
- Wow.
- Wow, indeed.

167
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:03,702
We won't be going
back to the old days anymore.

168
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,371
- Yeah.
- And it's got nothing to do with inflation.

169
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,120
Rates rise independently of tight money.

170
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,457
Uh...

171
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:21,091
What... What sort of, uh, references
do you have, Mr., uh, Roundy?

172
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,218
Ref... Reference? Uh...

173
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,142
Yeah. Uh, I do Barbara Rush.

174
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,303
You do what?

175
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,223
Her hair. I do Barbara Rush.

176
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:38,487
S-See, I was talking about,
uh, credit references and...

177
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,568
Jesus.
Let me have a cigarette. Come on.

178
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:47,621
So what? We get a trip out of it anyway.
It's a job.

179
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,916
Egypt? Why Egypt?

180
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:53,460
Well, because that's where
the pyramids are, Jill.

181
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,833
- You seem disappointed.
- No.

182
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,374
Egypt?

183
00:11:58,468 --> 00:12:02,587
Look, is there somewhere else you'd rather go?
Maybe we could change our location.

184
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,013
No! No, that's not it.

185
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,091
Do you have children?

186
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,392
No.

187
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,141
- Are you married?
- No.

188
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,690
- Do you have something against traveling?
- No.

189
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:17,689
- Do you have something against us?
- No.

190
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,696
Look, Jill, you can just come out and say it.

191
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,370
I'm embarrassed.

192
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,292
We'll let you know tomorrow.

193
00:12:36,214 --> 00:12:37,921
Thank you for coming by.

194
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:42,669
Uh, look, please don't misunderstand me.
I would really like to go.

195
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,194
- Thank you.
- Sure.

196
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:10,405
Jesus, this town.

197
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,911
I don't know what a financial statement is.
I got the heads.

198
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,812
- You got the what?
- Right? The heads. The customers.

199
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,748
They come to me.
I'm the one they want.

200
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:19,330
If I open a shop,
they're gonna leave and come to me.

201
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,586
- I got a lot of heads.
- Listen, I'm sure you do.

202
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:23,737
- You don't know what I'm talking about, do you?
- No, I don't...

203
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,201
How do you expect to lend me money if you
don't know the first thing about my business?

204
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,307
I don't.

205
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,302
Good morning, Mr. Roundy.

206
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,701
Excuse me. Uh, I think that I'm entitled
to make out a financial statement.

207
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,620
Yes, of course.

208
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:52,992
Uh, Miss Michaels,

209
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,166
would you hand me a couple of those forms
of financial statements, please?

210
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:58,118
Thanks very much.

211
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,650
You just have these notarized, bring them back,
and we'll see where we go from here, okay?

212
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,960
- Thank you.
- Sure.

213
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,217
You asshole.

214
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,247
- Do you know what George did the other night?
- Mm-mmm.

215
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,333
He wakes me up at two o'clock in the morning
just to do my hair.

216
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,962
Why?

217
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,919
I don't know.

218
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,630
I don't know. He just woke me up
and he said, "Come on, get up.

219
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,683
I'm gonna make you
the grooviest-looking chick in this town."

220
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:56,476
So what did you do?

221
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,305
Well, I looked at him and I said,
"George, if you love me,

222
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,517
I <i>am</i> the grooviest-looking chick in this town."

223
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,852
- Did he cut your hair?
- No.

224
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:07,359
- We didn't get around to that.
- Uh-huh.

225
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,740
Um, Jackie,

226
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:14,366
when you and George were together, you know,
did he do stuff like that?

227
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,957
Oh, I don't know, honey.
I can't remember. It was so long ago.

228
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,783
Yeah, it was a stupid question.

229
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,124
Anyway, I'm so pleased
that you're so happy with Lester.

230
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,330
- Mm-mmm.
- It's wonderful.

231
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,131
He's really great.

232
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,577
It's so great to wake up in the morning
with your rent paid.

233
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,671
I'm afraid George
was just too much of a gypsy for me.

234
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,380
He was always gonna settle down, but...

235
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,932
- He went to the bank today.
- Oh, he did?

236
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,394
Well, I just couldn't wait that long.

237
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,767
But George is great.

238
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,850
Yeah, George is great.

239
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,434
Great.

240
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,499
Hello, George!

241
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,422
Hey, baby. What's happening?

242
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,125
Nothing. I reconciled with Ron.

243
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:15,135
- Ron?
- You know. Ron. The guy I divorced last summer.

244
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,637
Great. Uh...

245
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,093
- Hope you make it.
- Call me.

246
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:23,181
Uh, I don't... I don't have your number.
Why don't you stop by the shop? Okay?

247
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,647
- Am I... Am I dry?
- Oh, it's glorious.

248
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,781
Height. You know, just right through here.

249
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,154
Always to drive me.
It was the most painful thing.

250
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,327
Could someone feel me?

251
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,905
- Am I... Am I dry?
- If my mother'd been where...

252
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,082
George. Is this a nice height?

253
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:43,875
- I'll see you later.
- Great.

254
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,519
You're late. I don't want to talk about it.

255
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,196
- You don't know what happened.
- I don't care.

256
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,198
- You don't know what happened. This girl...
- I don't care about that girl.

257
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,616
- I don't care if she's dead.
- Calm down.

258
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,744
- Norman says you're not collecting for the coffee.
- You know what you can tell Norman.

259
00:16:58,768 --> 00:17:00,634
- Sorry. Sorry.
- You don't understand.

260
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,648
I don't take up your time.
Don't take up <i>my</i> time.

261
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,042
- You're right. You're absolutely right.
- My time is important.

262
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,978
You want to stick to hair?
Let's stick to hair.

263
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:09,829
- Don't do that with the bleach. Have Mary do it.
- Have Mary do what?

264
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:13,321
- I mean, you have no respect for me.
<i>- I</i> have no respect for...

265
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:17,151
You can't distinguish between me
and one of your goddamn Hollywood "mubbers"!

266
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:18,861
- What?
- Numbers!

267
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,682
- Numbers!
- That's not Wella. That's Tickle Pink.

268
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,288
- What?
- Numbers.

269
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:23,957
I-I-I don't have to take this.

270
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,323
- I don't need to be put in this kind of position.
- I'm not putting you in any...

271
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,212
- What are you here for?
- A wash and set.

272
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,298
- No.
- No?

273
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,004
- You need a cut.
- But M-Mr. Norman said...

274
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:35,677
Well, look, I'm George,
and I say you need to be cut.

275
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,506
I like myself far too much...
I like myself far too much...

276
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,577
- I'm not trying to put you in any kind of pos...
- to be put in this kind of position.

277
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,746
I'm not... Just...
All right, I'll have Mary wash you.

278
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,227
Mary? Mary.

279
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,804
- Yeah?
- Wash her.

280
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,085
- With what?
- A Brillo pad, anything. I don't care.

281
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:50,726
Honey, I-I'm not trying
to put you in a position...

282
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:53,358
Shit. What... I'll be right back.

283
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,064
<i>Cassie, when you're ready.</i>

284
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,459
Taking a lot of shit lately, George.

285
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,161
Well, it's Norman.

286
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,837
Ain't no Norman.

287
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:15,588
You're just like my Otis. He can't keep
his hands out of ladies' hair either.

288
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:17,715
Mmm. How's Otis doin' anyway?

289
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,717
Got a letter from him yesterday.

290
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,094
He just made corporal
or a squad leader or something.

291
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,346
Well... that's great.

292
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:28,727
Rocco, I do not believe
what you are saying to me!

293
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,354
That was the purest comment
that I have ever made!

294
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:33,547
- George, if you can't do my hair...
- Just stop right there.

295
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:35,608
I'm going crazy in here.

296
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:37,155
- Why?
- I don't know.

297
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,881
I've been cutting too much hair lately.
I'm losing all my concepts.

298
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,568
Huh?

299
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,028
Baby, you're great.

300
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,122
George.

301
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,536
Hey, baby. What's happening?

302
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:50,586
Um, they want me to go to Egypt
for three weeks.

303
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,163
Oh, great. Jill, say hello to Felicia.

304
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,044
- Hello.
- Hello.

305
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,421
- So, how'd it go at the bank?
- Great.

306
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,549
Um, could I speak to you for a second?

307
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,973
- Well, I mean, you know...
- Go ahead, George.

308
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,550
- Could I?
- Yeah.

309
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,057
<i>Phone call for Mrs. Epstein.</i>

310
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,887
I said I wasn't sure I could go.

311
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,847
- Go where?
- Egypt.

312
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,729
- Oh. Great. Listen, I gotta get back.
- Okay, okay.

313
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,778
- But how'd it go at the bank?
- Uh, great. Can we talk later?

314
00:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,446
- Yeah.
- Okay.

315
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,707
- What were you doing at the bank?
- Oh, nothing.

316
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,156
- I'm trying to get my own shop going.
- Really?

317
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,990
- George.
- Yeah?

318
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,917
You're late.

319
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,416
We're all backed up
and you're supposed to go to Buffums.

320
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,793
- Buffums?
- Yes, Buffums.

321
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,445
- I got heads here, Norman.
- You promised me you would do the show.

322
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:40,677
- Aw, fuck, Norman!
- George!

323
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,219
If that man calls me one more time...

324
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,100
- Did you tell Gloria she needed a cut?
- Her ends are split.

325
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,683
Well, don't you contradict me
in public again.

326
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,770
Now, what is this horseshit
about not collecting for the coffee?

327
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,863
Listen, I'm doing twice as much
as I'm supposed to.

328
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,386
And if you think I'm gonna charge $25 a head
and hit on them for a cup of coffee,

329
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,322
you can shove it right up your ass.

330
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:07,371
I want you to learn to collect
for the coffee, George.

331
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:12,417
Will you learn to nickel and dime!
You're gonna end up without a pot to pee in.

332
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,879
Well, you're looking great, baby.

333
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,754
- What are you doing later?
- Whatever you say.

334
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,364
We have this political thing tonight.
Could you comb me out at the house?

335
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,504
Sure.

336
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,157
- You actually went to the bank?
- Yeah.

337
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,340
- For a loan?
- Yeah.

338
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,642
- You really want your own shop?
- Yeah.

339
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,811
- Why don't you see Lester?
- What?

340
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,012
- Your husband?
- Yes.

341
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,347
- What about?
- The shop.

342
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:36,184
I think you'd be a good investment.
I don't mind telling him.

343
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:38,269
Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star. I'm a star.

344
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:40,319
- George.
- Hey, baby.

345
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,648
- Uh, say hello to Felicia.
- I already said hello.

346
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,529
- Oh.
- George, when can we talk?

347
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,180
- Well, I'm right in the middle of work now.
- I know, but this is important.

348
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,038
- I have a decision to make.
- About what? What?

349
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,286
About whether or not I'm going.

350
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,288
- Going where?
- Egypt!

351
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:56,711
Well, honey, did they offer you the job yet?

352
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,959
No! But I... But I think they might.

353
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:02,154
- Uh, w-wait a minute. I'll be right back.
- I don't know what I need anymore!

354
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,340
George, is she the one
with the pancreatic ulcer?

355
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,762
I don't know.

356
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:09,467
- They didn't offer you the job?
- I still want your feelings about it.

357
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,052
Uh, after work.
Can't we talk after work?

358
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,541
But I never know when you're working
and when you're not working.

359
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:15,959
- Neither do I, baby.
- George. George!

360
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,191
Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici
just did?

361
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,939
- Please...
- Right after I sprayed her?

362
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,315
- She touched it.
- Well...

363
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,300
Then she played in it
and made it all into something else.

364
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,690
Now I don't know what it is.

365
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:28,346
- Well, you just gotta get... I'm busy, Ricci.
- I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.

366
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,783
- Jill...
- I am worth it! I'm worth it.

367
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,035
- Shit.
- Is she all right?

368
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,411
Yeah, she's fine.

369
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,290
Anyway, I really think
you <i>would</i> be a good investment.

370
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,372
- Great. Well...
- I wouldn't tell Lester if I didn't think so.

371
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,916
- You really mean it?
- I mean it.

372
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,962
I mean it, or I wouldn't say it.

373
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,390
Hey, Dennis.

374
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,638
- Felicia looks great that way, right?
- Right.

375
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,139
Great.

376
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,895
Yeah?

377
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:21,212
Look, I don't know and I don't care

378
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,711
whether the goddamn fish
are laying their eggs in the Baltic.

379
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,383
I want beluga caviar!

380
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,677
Call Chasen's. Call Jurgenson's.

381
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:30,548
I don't care how much it costs. It...

382
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:32,766
How much?

383
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,054
Well, then spend it.
Just be sure it's there on the table tonight.

384
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,060
Jesus Christ.
You gotta do everything yourself.

385
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:51,569
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.

386
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:52,869
Well, yeah.

387
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,410
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.

388
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,457
Thank you.

389
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,378
I didn't say it. She did.

390
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,499
Yeah.

391
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:07,376
How'd you happen
to get into that... line of work?

392
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,592
I went to beauty school. You know.

393
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:16,268
I mean, first you go to beauty school
and then you get your operator's license.

394
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:20,518
And then you graduate,
and then you're a hairdresser.

395
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,605
It's an unusual trade.

396
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,151
But the important thing is,
you're successful at it.

397
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:33,155
- In a way, but I-I-I...
- What's this?

398
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:35,432
- The thing is, I'm...
- The deck chairs for Mr. Russell.

399
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,618
Is that what that son of a bitch
calls wholesale?

400
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,916
- Uh...
- All right, we've had it with him.

401
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,913
- I'm better than the guy I work for.
- Well, that's very good, George.

402
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,213
It's wonderful that you wanna do something.

403
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,548
Thank you.

404
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:55,633
But... well, personal services
aren't the kind of thing I usually get into.

405
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,184
There's no way of keeping track
of anything.

406
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,333
It's a cash business. You gotta watch
your operators or they'll steal you blind.

407
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,849
- Now, am I right or am I right?
- Uh, you're right.

408
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,026
No, who needs that aggravation?

409
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,279
When I come home from work, there's...

410
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:12,028
I'm sorry, Lester,
but I have to have that key!

411
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,194
- What key?
- What key? I've been ringing and ringing you.

412
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,531
The garage door is locked.
The man from Sloan's is coming. I've been...

413
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,412
How'd you lose that key?

414
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,038
Oh, George, this is Jackie.

415
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,585
- Well, uh...
- Oh, hi.

416
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,959
I mean, um, hello. We've met.

417
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,882
- Is that right?
- Yes.

418
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,881
George is a terrific hairdresser.

419
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:34,174
That's what I hear.

420
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,510
- How's Norman?
- Oh, great. Great.

421
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:43,096
- Who's doing your hair?
- Oh, nobody much.

422
00:24:44,274 --> 00:24:46,436
George is thinking about
opening up his own shop.

423
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,442
- No kidding. Your own shop? Huh.
- Yeah.

424
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,075
George, will you, uh,
excuse us a moment, please?

425
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:58,028
Sure.

426
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,829
- In, uh...
- Out, please.

427
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,122
Yeah.

428
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:08,580
I called to tell you I was sending a key over,
but the line was busy.

429
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,758
You're al... always on the phone.

430
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:18,340
My secretary says
she saw you talking to that boy.

431
00:25:18,434 --> 00:25:20,096
Steve?

432
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,393
Whatever his name is. That... That actor.

433
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,564
Steve Slutes
couldn't get arrested as an actor.

434
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,943
He couldn't get arrested as a boy.

435
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,112
Then you were talking to him?

436
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:36,358
I ran into him at the 76 station
on Little Santa Monica.

437
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:38,430
What was I supposed to do,
hide in the ladies room?

438
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,366
Yes, I was talking to him.

439
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,994
I'm always on the phone
because you never let me see anybody.

440
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:46,417
I can't even bring my girlfriends to the house
in case they might run into you.

441
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:49,712
It's driving me up the wall, Lester.
You're even jealous of the dogs.

442
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,506
I mean, I have to talk to somebody, don't I?
Don't I?

443
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:56,549
I'm not jealous of the dogs.

444
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,304
I'm not jealous of anybody.

445
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:03,305
It's just that I can't afford
to get caught... off base.

446
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,432
So I can't talk to some broken-down actor.

447
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,515
What do you think,
I'm gonna tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf?

448
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,476
Of course not.

449
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,482
That's not very logical, Lester.

450
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,154
It <i>is</i> logical.

451
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,698
It's the most logical thing in the world.

452
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:20,505
You wouldn't feel this confined
if we could go out with a few people,

453
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,992
have a little dinner,
a little conversation and so forth.

454
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,665
Oh, yes? How about starting with tonight?

455
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,373
Look, sweetheart, I-I know it's tough.

456
00:26:29,463 --> 00:26:30,670
Mmm.

457
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:34,750
But at this point my business involves
handling money for a lot of touchy people.

458
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,551
Politics and so forth.

459
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:42,341
Felicia's in
a very difficult period in her life.

460
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,478
Any divorce and settlement
and so forth and...

461
00:26:49,066 --> 00:26:52,059
well, my finances'd
have to be looked into.

462
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,145
You and your touchy investors.

463
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:58,232
You do well for people,
they don't ask you to stop.

464
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,321
Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll.

465
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,403
Not even Uncle Sam.

466
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,573
They all want their share.

467
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,952
You're lying about one thing, Lester.

468
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,920
What's that?

469
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,166
You're still jealous.

470
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,467
Hmm?

471
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,509
God, you're a doll.

472
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,810
Now, look, I'll, uh...

473
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,565
I'll work something out about tonight.
I promise.

474
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,397
No. I promise.

475
00:27:36,405 --> 00:27:38,021
Huh? Hmm?

476
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:39,822
Oh.

477
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,784
Give me the key to the Bowmont house, huh?

478
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:48,875
Thanks.

479
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,702
Come on, George. I'll walk you down.

480
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,764
- Felicia seems very interested in your shop.
- Yeah.

481
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,605
You know, George, you may not think
that ten or 15 grand means much to me,

482
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,729
but I invest for myself
and a lot of particular people.

483
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,027
So I want a little more of your thinking
on the subject.

484
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:20,526
- When?
- "When"?

485
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:27,241
- Well, how about tonight?
- Tonight?

486
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:30,039
Yeah, I have some big contributors
coming over to the Bistro.

487
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,616
We're gonna watch the returns.

488
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,953
It's a pain in the ass,
but it's, well, something I have to do.

489
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:38,211
- We'll have a little time to talk there.
- Oh, great.

490
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,589
That's great. Yeah.

491
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:45,763
Maybe on your way over
you could, uh, pick up Jackie here.

492
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,312
No, it's good you want
to do something, George.

493
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,565
Wish my son knew what he wanted to do.

494
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,817
Anything, just so long as it's something.

495
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,776
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school.

496
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,953
Anyway, see you tonight, huh, doll?

497
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,456
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

498
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,541
- Your car down here?
- Mm-hmm.

499
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,841
Uh, I'm supposed to take Jill
to El Cholo tonight.

500
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,924
- Oh, it's all right. She can come with us.
- I don't want her to.

501
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,559
All right.

502
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,898
Are you really serious about this shop?

503
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,025
- Are you serious about Lester?
- I asked you first.

504
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,104
Well, I'm never serious about anything.

505
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,525
- How long you had this?
- About six weeks.

506
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,780
Well, I won't be going tonight either.

507
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,829
- Oh, honey, please do this for me...
- Does he know we went together?

508
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,656
Well, no. It never came up.

509
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,538
Well, tell him we went together.
Then I'll take you.

510
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,274
There's not one girl who comes into that shop
you wouldn't do this for.

511
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:01,210
I'm not gonna be a beard
for you and this guy.

512
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,134
- Why? Is it against your principles?
- Yeah.

513
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,823
I'd like to know what you've been doing
with his wife to get the money for the shop.

514
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,760
Oh, yeah? I don't fuck anybody for money.
I do it for fun.

515
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,117
Hey, I'll do whatever you want me to.
You know that.

516
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,490
Sometimes, George...

517
00:30:32,581 --> 00:30:34,823
Want me to do your hair?

518
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,578
Oh, no...

519
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,081
Oh, I don't know!
What do you think? Huh?

520
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,128
Oh, boy.

521
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,796
George!

522
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:46,376
- You can't leave. What are you doing?
- Stop by the shop. I'll see what I can do.

523

No, I tried that stuff.

You know I always burn. You...

534
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:29,427
Yes, when I went to the dermatologist
he gave me that stuff, and it gave me a rash.

535
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,721
Well, that's fine for you.

536
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,641
No. You have a different skin than me.

537
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,304
All right. All right, I-I-I'll try it.

538
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,359
Ah.

539
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,528
Think George is a fairy?

540
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,856
- Who?
- That kid. The hairdresser.

541
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,994
Well... I don't know for sure.

542
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,037
He is a hairdresser.

543
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:58,706
Thank you, Mona.

544
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,582
Maybe he's just a kooky guy
who likes to do kooky things, huh?

545
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,539
Maybe. Why do you ask?

546
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,295
Oh, I'm thinking of investing with him.

547
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,422
- He worries me.
- Why?

548
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,838
Well, maybe he's too flighty
and irresponsible.

549
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,299
That's why I asked if he was a fairy.

550
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,060
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.

551
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:23,356
Well, you suggested it.
Don't you think it's a good idea?

552
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,900
Yes, but I thought... You know.

553
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,318
What?

554
00:32:27,404 --> 00:32:30,647
I thought you were indulging me.
You know how you indulge me, Lester.

555
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,403
No, doll. I listen to you.

556
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,142
If the deal doesn't make any money,
that's... that's not too bad either,

557
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:40,953
if it's... if it's handled right.

558
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,580
- Mmm.
- He's a nice boy.

559
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,286
I invited him tonight.

560
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,747
Just sorry he's a fairy.

561
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,837
Ah.

562
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,979
Well, what do you think?

563
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,274
Dr. Feldman says
that to a certain extent it's normal.

564
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,976
What's that?

565
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,187
- Post-natal frigidity.
- Uh-huh.

566
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,983
But with me it's really...

567
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:19,077
This guy just expected me
to jump right into bed.

568
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:23,659
I've gotta feel something tender or whatever.
I've got to know somebody.

569
00:33:23,752 --> 00:33:25,855
<i>George, will you pick up on line two, please.</i>

570
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,871
<i>Line two, George.</i>

571
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:29,882
Hello.

572
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:33,004
I'd like to, Jackie,
but I told you to stop by the shop.

573
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,756
Chicken salad.

574
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:39,515
Uh-huh. All right.
But I gotta be in Bel-Air by 4:00.

575
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,428
Ask Ricci if he'd wind up Anjanette for me,
would you?

576
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,860
There's still too much red.

577
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,655
Huh? No. Honey, it's great.
I'm sorry. I gotta split.

578
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,661
George, I can't do anyone else.
This moon gold's been chewing up my hands.

579
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,847
I have an appointment with the allergist.
It took me a week to get it.

580
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,079
Come on, Ricci.
I'm not asking you to do a dye job.

581
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,748
- But why can't you finish her?
- Now what's the problem, George?

582
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:06,812
- No problem, no problem.
- George says he can't finish Anjanette.

583
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,168
I don't care.

584
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:11,168
You don't have to comb out Mrs. Karpf
until four o'clock.

585
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,498
- Why can't you finish her, George?
- I'm busy till 4:00.

586
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,464
- Busy doing what?
- Whatever I feel like.

587
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,297
Yes, and whenever you feel like it.

588
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:14,773
It's all right. Shut up.

589
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,106
Oh. Come on in.

590
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:28,575
Um... would you like a drink or something?

591
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,534
- Hmm?
- Uh, no, thanks.

592
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,458
Well, I would.

593
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,130
- Nice place.
- Mm-hmm.

594
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,301
Well, where do you want to do this?

595
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,383
Uh, you got a bathroom or something?

596
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:48,185
- Oh, can't we do it in here? Huh?
- Huh?

597
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,479
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- I'd cut it.

598
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:52,807
- Cut it?
- Yeah, I think so.

599
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:55,234
- Well, you don't seem to be very sure.
- I-I-I'm sure.

600
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,563
- You don't like it the way it is?
- Honey, it makes you look like a hooker.

601
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,695
George, what a terrible thing to say.

602
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,779
What do you want me to do, lie to you?
I'd cut it.

603
00:36:17,217 --> 00:36:19,425
One thing... I have to look great tonight.

604
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,969
I mean, I have to look absolutely great.

605

00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,023
How about what?

612
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,070
I can't.

Not too much off, eh? Huh?

619
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,598
Oh, George, what's the matter?

620
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:10,927
- Nothing. Everything's great.
- Great?

621
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:14,013
- Good.
- Good?

622
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:17,183
Not bad.

623
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:19,485
"Not bad" is not "great."

624
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:22,359
- I lied a little.
- That's not even "good."

625
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,065
I lied a lot.

626
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,286
Yeah, uh... I, uh...

627
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,364
Oh, stop it, you silly.

628
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,710
It's a little hot in here, huh?

It's the, um... the steam room.

630
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,499
Lester likes me to keep it on
in case he wants to use it.

631
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,877
That's better.

632
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,756
Mmm.

I need you!

636
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:16,371
Mona, this earring...
Will you please try and find the other one?

637
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,703
And when George comes,
please tell him to wait.

638
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:21,585
I have to pick up a dress.
I may have to have it fitted.

639
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,586
But be sure to tell him to wait.

640
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,588
Yes, ma'am.
But I have to go to the market.

641
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,842
Mona, make sure he doesn't leave.
It's important.

642
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:48,198
Anyway, the guy at the bank thought
I was some kind of hippie or something.

643
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:50,276
- Oh.
- I did it to myself.

644
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,034
He just didn't know a good thing
when he saw one.

645
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,285
- Jill's gonna be mad.
- Oh, no, she won't.

646
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:58,296
Wh-Wh-What are you doing in the back?
Let me see.

647
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:01,086
- You'll see. You'll see.
- I tell you, Jill absolutely adores you.

648
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,458
Mmm.

649
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:05,542
- Remember Myrna Lynn?
- Tsk. Mmm.

650
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,171
She adored me.

651
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:10,032
Then one day she called me her hairdresser
and took off to Palm Springs

652
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,638
with some agent from William Morris.

653
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,932
Well, Jill is 20 times the girl Myrna is, really.

654
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,010
- Yeah, exactly.
- What does that mean?

655
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:20,097
I don't know.
You get so you can sense these things.

656
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,682
What?

657
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:25,190

Come on.

667
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,948
Oh, I just can't wait to see Lester

668
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:22,035
with me and that cunt
in the same room tonight.

669
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,580
Hey.

670
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,513
Well, did you or didn't you? Hmm?

671
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,300
Hmm?

672
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,429
Can't stand to miss one of them, can you?

673
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,899
George.

674
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,255
<i>US Steel, 43, up three-eighths.</i>

681
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,572
Yeah.

682
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,910
Oh, you're a genius, honey.

683
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,287
You're a genius.

684
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,794
You're a genius.

685
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,317
- Oh, no, baby.
- Hmm?

686
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,990
No. No, baby, no.

687
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,033
I want to. Come on.

688
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,407
No, no, no.

689
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,783
Come on.

690
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:26,875
- Oh, baby, no.
- Hmm?

691
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,918
Baby, no, no, no, really.
No, really.

692
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,710
- Sorry.
- Baby, no. It'll ruin everything!

693
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,258
Mmm. Oh, baby.

694
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,802

00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,755
Fuck me.

700
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,548
Honey!

701
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,547
My God, it's Lester!

702
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:19,629
- Get up, get up. Get up!
- Doll?

703
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,015
Jackie?

704
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,841
- Oh, God, do something, please.
- Uh...

705
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:25,346
Baby, you sleepin'?

706
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,433
Jackie?

707
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:34,769
Jackie?

708
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,107
Oh, shut the door! Shut the door, honey!

709
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,651
Come on!

710
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,281
Oh.

711
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,863
Sorry.

712
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,465
Either come in or stay out.

713
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:00,072
Shut the door, honey.
What do you think this is, a picnic? Come on.

714
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,588
- Just don't let the steam out.
- Oh.

715
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,740
Hey, Jackie?

716
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,826
I brought you a little something, doll.

717
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,501
You look like you had quite a workout.

718
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:43,258
It's nerve-racking.
Women can get you very upset sometimes.

719
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,760
- I know, I know.
- This doing hair, it's just...

720
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,474
I know.

721
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:51,521
Look, I know you have to deal with Felicia
and you're caught in the middle,

722
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:53,476
but if you can just bear with me tonight...

723
00:44:53,566 --> 00:44:54,977
Oh, hey.

724
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:58,731
No, listen, it's a difficult situation.
I want you to know I appreciate it.

725
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:02,280
All right? It's gonna be very...
very tough on me.

726
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,866
Well, I-I-I don't know...

727
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,944
But we'll do business, son, I...

728
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,531
I can tell you that.

729
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:36,182
Better clean that mess up
or the dogs'll get it all over the house.

730
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,143
What have you been doing?
Get out of there. Come on.

731
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,895
You oughta get rid of those dogs.

732
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,197
They get hair all over the place.

733
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:47,651
They're Yorkies, and they don't shed.

734
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:51,322
- Aren't you having a drink?
- No.

735
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,623
- Well, why not?
- I don't want one.

736
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:57,836
Oh, come on, doll.
Have a little drink. It's five o'clock.

737
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,789
I don't want one!

738
00:46:01,676 --> 00:46:05,090
First you tell me not to drink.
Then you tell me to drink. Which is it?

739
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,883
I don't want a drink.

740
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:11,717
I called to tell you I was on my way,
but the line was busy.

741
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,594
You're always on the phone.

742
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:22,037
- You here to see my mother?
- Yeah, uh, do you...

743
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:24,248
She's out. You're supposed to wait.

744
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:27,668
Nobody's home up there.

745
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:29,674
Maybe, u-uh... Uh...

746
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,600
You hungry?

747
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,147
Yeah, a little.

748
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,446
This is the one thing I like
about this house.

749
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,237
- Want some lox?
- No, thanks.

750
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,123
You're my mother's hairdresser.

751
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,250
I do hair, yeah.

752
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,627
- Chopped liver?
- No, thanks.

753
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,171
Are you gay?

754
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,719
Want a baked apple?
They're cold, but they're good.

755
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,843
No, thanks.

756
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,183
Did you hear me?

757
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,010
Yeah.

758
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:20,937
Well, are you? Are you queer?

759
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,810
Mmm, sure.

760
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,892
Come on. Are you or aren't you?

761
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,521
This is great, you know.

762
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:29,400
Come on. Tell me. Don't be afraid.

763
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,073
Why do you want to know so bad?

764
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,617
See if you've been making it
with my mother.

765
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:37,446
Why would my being a faggot
have anything to do with that?

766
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,532
Nothing, I guess.

767
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,705
Have you ever made it with a guy?

768
00:48:42,795 --> 00:48:44,707
Well, you ever make it with a girl?

769
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,164
Uh, well...

770
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,841
- Are you?
- Am I what? Wh-What are you talking about?

771
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,010
Making it with my mother?

772
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,426
I'd like to do your hair sometime.

773
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,225
Do you have a thing about older women?

774
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,728
That's sort of faggoty, isn't it?

775
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,772
I never get my hair done.

776
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:17,156
In fact, I don't think I've ever been
to a beauty salon in my whole life.

777
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:18,246
Yeah?

778
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,915
- You think that's funny, don't you?
- Yeah.

779
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,748
Beverly Hills hairdresser.

780
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:29,126
You might as well be a faggot.

781
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,423
Think that's funny too?

782
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,091
No.

783
00:49:32,178 --> 00:49:33,419
No, no.

784
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,094
Then what <i>do</i> you think?

785
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:40,175
Well, you know, I think you've got
exactly the same eyes as your mother.

786
00:49:40,269 --> 00:49:43,228
And... your chin's a little bit like hers too.

787
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:45,180
- No, it isn't.
- I think it is.

788
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:47,812
No, no.
And my eyes aren't like hers either.

789
00:49:47,902 --> 00:49:50,183
- They <i>are.</i>
- No, they're not. I'm nothing like my mother.

790
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,324
I'm not trying to insult you, you know.

791
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,786
Can't we just, uh, be friends?

792
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,205
Okay.

793
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,343
You wanna fuck?

794
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:24,769
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

795
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:28,397
- As long as you don't ask me what sign I am.
- Okay.

796
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,022
Are you married?

797
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,319
Sometimes.

798
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:37,865
But, uh, not at the moment.

799
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:43,204
Would you like to go to a party?

800
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,138
George?

801
00:51:18,867 --> 00:51:20,233
George.

802
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,186
<i>Seventeen percent.
Now, doesn't that tell you something...</i>

803
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,202
- Lorna...
<i>- about the permissive atmosphere...</i>

804
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:33,334
Lorna, have you seen George,
by any chance?

805
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:34,915
He's my hairdresser.

806
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:36,841
- He's in the bathroom.
- What?

807
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,338
He's in the bathroom.

808
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,712
He's in <i>your</i> bathroom?

809
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,284
<i>- Nobody should know better than you...</i>
- Yeah.

810
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:44,425
<i>...that we have an attorney general
in Washington...</i>

811
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,761

00:51:47,855 --> 00:51:49,892
<i>to fight organized crime.</i>

<i>For the past seven years,</i>

00:51:53,402 --> 00:51:55,268
<i>crime has been rising...</i>

815

<i>nine times the span
of the population of this country.</i>

816
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,024
<i>In seven years...</i>

817
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,859
- Hello, George.
- Hi.

818
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:05,912
- Uh, I should be dry by now.
<i>- Forty-three percent of the people...</i>

819
00:52:05,998 --> 00:52:07,614
Uh...

820

822
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,094
George, come here.

823
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:30,929
- What? Huh?
- Come here.

824
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:32,434
- No.
- You dry?

825
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:33,560
No!

826
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,485
- Don't comb my hair out, Geo...
- No... I'll do it now.

827
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:40,530
No, George, you can do it later,
for heaven sakes.

828
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:42,858
George...

829
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,409
- I'm so glad you're gonna be there tonight.
- What?

830
00:52:45,496 --> 00:52:47,658
I'm so glad you're gonna be there tonight.

831
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,410
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

832
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,787
Uh...

833
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,709
- Right here?
- Right here.

834
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:56,997
- I don't care.
- Um, let me get the...

835
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:58,707
- I don't care.
- I'd better get the...

836
00:52:58,801 --> 00:53:00,167
I don't want to.

837
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,466
So?

838
00:53:39,258 --> 00:53:42,046
- Where's your car?
- A friend dropped me off.

839
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,171
- Who?
- Never mind.

840
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,302
I'm going tonight. Jackie asked me.

841
00:53:52,396 --> 00:53:54,388
I need you to fix my hair.

842
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:56,644
Wants to pick us up pretty soon, huh?

843
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:59,647
Well, she doesn't have to pick me up.
I'm going with somebody else.

844
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:02,195
By the way, you never did say
how it went this morning.

845
00:54:02,281 --> 00:54:05,615
Oh. Uh... okay.

846
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:09,861
- Well, are they gonna give you the loan?
- Well, uh...

847
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,039
- Uh...
- I don't know why I bother to ask!

848
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:17,494
The only way you're ever gonna
get money out of a bank is to rob one.

849
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,916
- What are you so mad about?
- Oh, just fix my hair.

850
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,838
You break your neck to go up to Jackie's.

851
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:27,386
- When do I get <i>my</i> hair done?
- She asked me to do her hair.

852
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:29,806
Does that mean you have to do
whatever anybody asks?

853
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:32,620
Why am I always at the end of the line
when you're passing out favors?

854
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:34,556
You want me to do your hair,
I'll do your hair.

855
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,624
And stop kissing everybody's ass
that comes into that shop.

856
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,377
That's not gonna put you in business.
That's gonna make you a kiss-ass!

857
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:42,064
- Come on, Jill. I'm trying to get things moving.
- Oh, grow up!

858
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:45,363
You never stop moving.
You never go anywhere. Grow up!

859
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,656
Grow up! Grow up!

860
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:11,638
Honey, I'm sorry.

861
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,466
Uh, you're right.

862
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:19,143
I just want us to have a normal life
like everybody else.

863
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,772
Jesus. I-I just can't take it anymore.

864
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:30,200
All I want is to get up early
and run my own business,

865
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,572
take you out to a movie on the weekend.

866
00:55:39,503 --> 00:55:43,793
I'm trying, honey. I just...
I just can't get out of my own way.

867
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:46,215
I know. I know.

868
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:48,384
Honey, I'm so sorry.

869
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:58,303
Well, come on.

870
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,821
Honey, come on. We don't have much time.

871
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,581
Sure.

872
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:40,846
What do you know about this guy?

873
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:43,515
He's a director.

874
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:46,268
- You ever heard of him?
- Sure.

875
00:56:46,361 --> 00:56:48,603
Movies or television?

876
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,689
Commercials. Make you feel better?

877
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,950
Thought it might.

878
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:57,029
Yeah. Commercials.

879
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:15,839
Who is that?

880
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:22,645
- Who is it?
- Ah, it's nobody.

881
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:24,017
Nobody.

882
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:30,020
I'm sorry, sir.
There's a private party upstairs.

883
00:57:31,073 --> 00:57:33,110
Jesus. It's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.

884
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,237
George!

885
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:37,535
Looks like somebody took a dump in it.

886
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:40,159
- George.
- You've been chipping on me.

887
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,365
- Well, isn't it awful?
- Yeah.

888
00:57:43,335 --> 00:57:45,122
Excuse me.

889
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,924
George, for Christ's sakes,
don't let me drink too much.

890
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,427
You don't do that anymore, do you?

891
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,133
Good evening.

892
00:58:07,109 --> 00:58:09,021
Check your coat?

893
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,401
- What?
- Your coat.

894
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,979
Oh. Uh...

895
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:16,149
Want me to take this?

896
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:21,655
- Okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

897
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:26,955
<i>Twentypercent
of the vote in, Nixon with a lead.</i>

898
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,331
Uh...

899
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:30,414
In case she wants it back.

900
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,917
<i>Eighty-four percent of the vote in Delaware.</i>

901
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:44,223
Well, what would you like to drink?

902
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:46,178
Um, I'll have a stinger.

903
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:47,764
Before dinner?

904
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:49,520
Well, I don't know. What do you think?

905
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:52,192
- Uh, why don't you try something light.
- Okay.

906
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:55,313
- Waiter?
- Yes, sir?

907
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:57,524
We'll have a white Dubonnet
on the rocks, please.

908
00:58:57,617 --> 00:59:00,109
- And for you?
- Just a little white wine.

909
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,820
Little white wine. And, uh...

910
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:06,123
Uh... I'll have a Coke.

911
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,543
- Soda with a twist.
- Yes, sir.

912
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:15,051
Oh. Sorry.

913
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,127
Daley's in a good spot.

914
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,179
Daley has had it. He is in.

915
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:24,259
George.

916
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:26,184
Glad you could make it, son.

917
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,058
- Hiya, doll.
- Lester.

918
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:30,936
- This is my friend Jill.
- Hello.

919
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:32,786
- Glad to know you, Jill.
- Nice to meet you.

920
00:59:32,861 --> 00:59:35,444
- And this is, uh...
- Johnny Pope.

921
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,613
- Mr. Pope.
- Hello.

922
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,442
Well...

923
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:45,121
Who are they?

924
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:47,699
Jill? I've told you about Jill a hundred times.

925
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:50,126
Lester, you never listen to anything I say.

926
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:51,828
Does she know about us?

927
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,630
Jesus, she's my best friend.

928
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,799
Well, I'll find room for them.

929
00:59:56,885 --> 00:59:59,468
Who's the guy? George's boyfriend?

930
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,388
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?

931
01:00:02,474 --> 01:00:04,466
Jackie, I'm only...

932
01:00:07,187 --> 01:00:09,679
George.
Kinda keep an eye on Jackie tonight.

933
01:00:09,773 --> 01:00:11,765
She's a little high-strung, you know.

934
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,770
See that she doesn't drink too much.

935
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,089
<i>Surprisingly, the race,
along with the presidential race...</i>

936
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:17,979
See you later, doll.

937
01:00:18,073 --> 01:00:20,531
<i>...makes California
very important at this moment.</i>

938
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:24,452
<i>The race that has also attracted attention
since it runs parallel to the presidential race</i>

939
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,530
<i>is the one for the United States Senate,</i>

940
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,912
<i>the seat, uh, which Tom Kuchel,
the Republican whip,</i>

941
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:33,995
<i>uh, lost in the primary to Max Rafferty,
state superintendent of public instruction.</i>

942
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:36,547
<i>And there, Cranston seems to be running
better than Humphrey.</i>

943
01:00:37,259 --> 01:00:40,252
- How does she know Lester Karpf?
- I don't know. Why?

944
01:00:41,847 --> 01:00:45,682
Well, I just wouldn't want him
mad at me, that's all.

945
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:49,602
<i>If you keep postponing taxes,
you're using the government's money,</i>

946
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:51,771
<i>and you don't worry what...</i>

947
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:56,734
George.

948
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,695
Uh, how are you?

949
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:06,619
Uh, Jackie? This is Jackie.
Say hello to Felicia.

950
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,448
Hello, Felicia.

951
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,876
I'm so glad that you could make it.

952
01:01:13,962 --> 01:01:16,579
I've been looking forward
to seeing you all evening.

953
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,289
Hmm.

954
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:23,010
Well...

955
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,265
Ohio's nothing to worry about.

956
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,223
Bet you don't remember
the first time we met.

957
01:01:32,314 --> 01:01:33,771
Well, you never know.

958
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,975
Lester, what the fuck
do you think you're doing?

959
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:38,400
Huh?

960
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:40,603
Oh, Jesus Christ, Nate. I'm sorry.

961
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,404
Oh, never mind. I'll do it myself.

962
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,819
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you.
Why did you have to bring her?

963
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:49,529
Oh, um, she's a friend of Jill's.

964
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:54,075
Who is Jill?

965
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:56,752
You know, she's a friend of Johnny Pope's,
the director.

966
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,329
Pardon me.

967
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:00,335
Oh.

968
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:07,463
<i>Nixon, 672, 000.</i>

969
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:09,970
<i>And that leaves California, the big one.</i>

970
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:15,852
<i>NBC News nowprojects
Nixon the winner in South Carolina.</i>

971
01:02:22,656 --> 01:02:24,648
Jackie? Jackie.

972
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:27,525
Jackie?

973
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:31,620
Excuse me. I know I know you,
but I can't remember where.

974
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:33,698
Uh... Uh, Bruce Barton's.

975
01:02:33,792 --> 01:02:36,500
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Come with me a minute, please.

976
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,202
Just come with me.

977
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,172
Come on.

978
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:45,047
<i>Exactly what can a president do</i>

979
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:47,719
<i>to affect the moral tone of the country?</i>

980
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:52,137
<i>A president can end
the permissive attitude</i>

981
01:02:52,227 --> 01:02:54,810
<i>noncritical of an individual
who decides for himself...</i>

982
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:58,606
That, uh, other couple we're with tonight.
Do you know them very well?

983
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:00,183
Why?

984
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:02,852
Why?

985
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:07,782
Well, I thought maybe you could explain
why George just went into the ladies' room.

986
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:09,358
George?

987
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:13,057
<i>We'll restore respect
for the United States of America.</i>

988
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:15,243
<i>Let's make one thing very clear.</i>

989
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:20,453
<i>In our administration, the American flag
will not be a doormat for anybody.</i>

990
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,880
- You gotta let me out.
- No, no. It's boring.

991
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,174
- You're going to get us killed.
- It's boring.

992
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,796
Come on.

993
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:28,878
- What?
- Come here.

994
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,218
Come here, you.

995
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:34,517
Uh, what... what do you want to do?

996
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,189
Now, listen, you both have tidelands.

997
01:03:40,275 --> 01:03:43,564
You both want Uncle Sam
to give you offshore drilling permits.

998
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,645
Why not do it together?

999
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:53,615
- Am I right, or am I right?
- That son of a bitch.

1000
01:03:53,705 --> 01:03:56,288
Everything he says is a phony piece of shit.

1001
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:01,161
What does he think I am,
some cigar butt he's got between his teeth?

1002
01:04:07,635 --> 01:04:09,467
He ignores me!

1003
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:13,924
<i>I want a recognition
of that constitutional republic</i>

1004
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:17,636
<i>because if we don'tget it,
then everything is of vanity.</i>

1005
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:21,018
He could have at least introduced me
to someone or something.

1006
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,598
Couldn't he?

1007
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,183
You're drunk.

1008
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:28,483
Oh, George, what do I want?

1009
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:31,987
Uh, well... how about some coffee?

1010
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:36,404
Oh, hi, doll. Say, what's wrong?

1011
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:38,239
You know what's wrong.

1012
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:41,417
<i>...wouldget the Wallace electors,
that's one thought.</i>

1013
01:04:41,503 --> 01:04:45,713
<i>Another possibility, it seems to me,
is that Mr. Wallace might,</i>

1014
01:04:45,799 --> 01:04:49,167
<i>verygraciously andgenerously,</i>

1015
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,751
<i>throw or direct his electors...</i>

1016
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:53,553
Felicia. There you are.

1017
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,256
We were just...

1018
01:04:55,350 --> 01:04:56,886
You know George.

1019
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:59,468
And, uh...

1020
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,178
uh...

1021
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:04,648
uh...

1022
01:05:06,694 --> 01:05:08,606
Jackie Shawn.

1023
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:10,403
Jackie Shawn.

1024
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:12,903
Yeah, my wi... Uh, Felicia.

1025
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:14,863
We've met.

1026
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:22,200
Well, uh, anyway, uh...

1027
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:28,422
Well, your hair, uh, looks just fabulous.

1028
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:30,921
- It's George.
- Just fabulous.

1029
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,758
Wonder if he could do anything with mine.

1030
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:38,011
Yeah, well, uh, I could try.

1031
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:42,887
Uh, well, do you wash your hair every day?

1032
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:45,974
- Well, isn't that bad for it?
- No, no, no, it's very good.

1033
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,337
Keeps the skin peeling.
You've gotta keep the skin peeling.

1034
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:51,354
Otherwise the little follicles don't have
a chance to breathe, you know.

1035
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,235
I mean, uh, that's how you lose your hair.

1036
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:56,533
Remember, the follicle never dies.

1037
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:57,985
Oh.

1038
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:01,409
This here really ought to...
ought to be layered, I think.

1039
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,908
- Layered?
- Yeah.

1040
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:06,585
Otherwise, it just sort of lies there,
you know, and it, uh...

1041
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,788
If you layer it, it kind of fluffs it out.

1042
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:11,624
Oh.

1043
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:17,471
Uh, I think everybody's ready
to eat dinner.

1044
01:06:17,557 --> 01:06:20,721
Are they, uh...
ready to sit down?

1045
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,426
Well, we don't know where to sit.

1046
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:24,682
- They're waiting for you, Lester.
- Oh.

1047
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:26,263
Waiter.

1048
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:32,353
One word out of you,
and I'll gargle with it.

1049
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,531
Try to stop her from drinking.

1050
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:39,139
I ca... Are you kidding?

1051
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:43,246
Yeah, you should have seen
those little kids, Senator.

1052
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:45,325
About 40 of 'em, all blind.

1053
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:48,084
We put these mattresses on the front lawn.

1054
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:51,539
They came running out of the house,
tripping and stumbling all over the place.

1055
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:55,217
Just having a hell of a good time.
I mean, they were blind, of course.

1056
01:06:55,303 --> 01:06:58,512
But I don't know, it gave me
a feeling of accomplishment.

1057
01:06:58,598 --> 01:07:00,806
I can't tell you
when I had such a good time.

1058
01:07:01,684 --> 01:07:04,802
- Aren't you hungry, Miss Shawn?
- Not for rubber chicken, no.

1059
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:06,888
Maybe I can get you something.

1060
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:10,524
Oh, that's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.

1061
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:12,021
Sid.

1062
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:16,481
Sid. You must be a very important executive.

1063
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:22,862
Well, whatever I am,
I think I can get you whatever you'd like.

1064
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,663
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

1065
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,742
- Whatever I'd like?
- Whatever you'd like.

1066
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:33,665
Well, most of all,
I'd like to suck his cock.

1067
01:07:36,344 --> 01:07:38,085
Hey. Guess what. Whoo!

1068
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:45,843
Uh, where did you say
the school is located?

1069
01:07:45,937 --> 01:07:49,351
Uh, just the other side of Santa Barbara.

1070
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,460
- Curious to see it sometime.
- Oh! Oh, my God!

1071
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,712
Oh, listen, darling, I can't stand it.

1072
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:56,444
It's killing me. Come on. Why not?

1073
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:58,272
Come on!

1074
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:00,323
Don't you want to?

1075
01:08:02,245 --> 01:08:05,329
Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world?

1076
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:06,415
You are.

1077
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:10,247
Fuckin'- A.

1078
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:15,039
Excuse me, Senator.

1079
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:22,009
Well, George, your friend feeling
a little under the weather?

1080
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,090
You phony asshole.

1081
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:26,891
Ah. That's too bad.

1082
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:29,603
- Uh...
- Get her out of here, George.

1083
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:31,369
- Oh, I'll go, I'll go.
- Come on.

1084
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:33,186
What was that?

1085
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:36,144
- Illinois.
- Ah. Good.

1086
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:38,854
Uh, I've got to take her out of here.

1087
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:41,281
- Go ahead. Take her home.
- Aren't you...

1088
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:44,951
Oh. Uh, I'll see you later.
Johnny'll take me home.

1089
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:48,156
<i>Not a bad place to visit,
but I don't wanna live here.</i>

1090
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:52,994
<i>By the way, I know this is not a projection,
it is not NBC's...</i>

1091
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,498
- Your coat.
- Oh, fuck it.

1092
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:58,109
<i>Just my own personal, private opinion.
I don't think we're going to get a winner tonight.</i>

1093
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:08,384
Ladies and gentlemen, I have been awarded

1094
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:12,472
the decided privilege of introducing
our guest of honor this evening.

1095
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:15,148
Are you all right?

1096
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,521
I'm just fine.

1097
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:18,978
Thanks.

1098
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:25,034
...and vote for the people,
for the country, for our Constitution.

1099
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:27,661
- Lester?
- Sweetheart, please.

1100
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:31,115
I hope you like Miss Shawn.

1101
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,293
What?

1102
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:37,963
Oh. Well, she's very nice, yes.
I mean, normally she...

1103
01:09:38,049 --> 01:09:41,167
Because she's going to be
very, very expensive.

1104
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:43,968
Now, look, sweetheart,
can't we go into this later?

1105
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:48,097
No.

1106
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:50,221
No, we cannot go into this later.

1107
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:53,475
Well, that's... that's okay too.

1108
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:56,147
Senator Joe East.

1109
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:02,897
I've blown it with Lester.

1110
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:05,698
I don't think so.
I thought you were great.

1111
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:07,777
Oh, you always say that.

1112
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,698
And I really care for Lester, don't I?

1113
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:17,370
Where do you want to go? Uh, Sammy's?

1114
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,750
Is he still having parties?

1115
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:21,207
Never stops.

1116
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:24,589
This tells the story
of the ancient grandmother,

1117
01:10:24,679 --> 01:10:28,013
who, upon seeing the garden gate
of her childhood,

1118
01:10:28,099 --> 01:10:30,933
stops for a moment and says,

1119
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:35,012
"Hello, garden gate. Hello, garden gate.

1120
01:10:35,106 --> 01:10:37,519
Garden gate, hello."

1121
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:54,157
Hi-yi-ya. Hi-yi-ya.

1122
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,414
Hi-yi-yo. Hi-yi-ya.

1123
01:10:57,503 --> 01:11:02,168
Hi-yi-ya! Hi-yi-ya! Hi-ya! Hi-ya!
Hi-yi-ya.

1124
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,716
Hi-yi-yo. Hi-yi-ya.

1125
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,543
Hi-ya-ya.

1126
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,629
Be straight with me, Lester.

1127
01:11:08,723 --> 01:11:12,342
Just be straight with me
for once in your life.

1128
01:11:14,228 --> 01:11:17,687
Look, Felicia, this party involves
more than you and me, you know.

1129
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:20,357
These people are concerned
about more than each other.

1130
01:11:20,443 --> 01:11:22,901
- Is that right?
- Yes, that's right.

1131
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:25,980
Some of us are trying to make this country
a better place to live in,

1132
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,280
believe it or not.

1133
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:30,429
Is that what this is all about?
To make this country a better place to live in?

1134
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,285
- Yes, that's what this is all about.
- Oh.

1135
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:34,328
Hi-yi-yo. Hi-yi-yo.

1136
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:37,408
It's a beautiful thing he's doing.

1137
01:11:37,502 --> 01:11:38,709
Hi-yi-ya!

1138
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,055
Hi-yi-ya.

1139
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:56,219
I recall another old ancient song.

1140
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:59,931
My God, Lester,
you are a miserable human being.

1141
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:03,768
- Man never loses...
- You're not helping anybody.

1142
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,944
You're just twisting arms here
to raise money

1143
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:09,194
for a lot of silly sons of bitches
who are all out for themselves.

1144
01:12:13,079 --> 01:12:14,365
You're kidding yourself

1145
01:12:14,455 --> 01:12:18,199
if you think your new business partner's
gonna keep his hands off your girl.

1146
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:20,784
Or she's going to keep <i>her</i> hands off <i>him.</i>

1147
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:23,495
What are you talking about, Felicia?

1148
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:27,253
Think while you have time to think, Lester.

1149
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:35,136
Excuse me, Senator.

1150
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:38,094
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're going to have to evacuate this room

1151
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,554
as quietly and as quickly as possible.

1152
01:12:40,648 --> 01:12:43,311
Believe me,
there's nothing to worry about.

1153
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:45,984
We would like to have you exit
through the door on my right,

1154
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:48,938
continue down the stairs,
and out into the street, please.

1155
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:31,897
Everything okay?

1156
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,402
Ah, shit!

1157
01:13:48,466 --> 01:13:50,628
You don't have to entertain me.

1158
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:53,461
- Am I entertaining you?
- We're friends.

1159
01:13:53,554 --> 01:13:55,090
That's true.

1160
01:13:55,181 --> 01:13:58,720
You feel like playing, you should go and play.
There are a lot of players here.

1161
01:13:58,809 --> 01:14:00,141
- George.
- George.

1162
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:01,889
Hey, how you doin'?

1163
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:03,595
- How are you doing?
- What's happening?

1164
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,681
- You're lookin' good.
- You look really good.

1165
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,767
- Come on down to the Jacuzzi.
- Oh, uh...

1166
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,398
Come to the Jacuzzi.
We're going there now.

1167
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:11,945
No, no, no, no. I can't.

1168
01:14:32,927 --> 01:14:35,965
- Hey, what's the problem, honey?
- His car... They have it blocked.

1169
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:37,546
Please move out.

1170
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:41,850
That's no problem.
Gene. You wanna move that truck?

1171
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:43,848
- Sure. No problem.
- Thank you.

1172
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:48,562
Listen, could you kids give me a ride?
I'm... kind of stranded.

1173
01:14:48,651 --> 01:14:50,483
Forget it, Wally. There's no bomb.

1174
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:51,650
- Sure.
- Mmm?

1175
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:52,737
- Yeah.
- Ah, good.

1176
01:14:52,822 --> 01:14:53,822
Come on.

1177
01:14:57,785 --> 01:14:59,777
Is it all right, son?

1178
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:02,704
It will be, as soon as I can find my keys.

1179
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:07,417
- Come on. I'll get in the back.
- No, no.

1180
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,916
- Oh, it's so little.
- No, no.

1181
01:15:19,974 --> 01:15:21,465
Oh!

1182
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:27,346
See? Nothin' to it.

1183
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:34,236
What did you say your name was, sweetie?

1184
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:35,937
Jill.

1185
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:37,819
Jill?

1186
01:15:37,908 --> 01:15:40,491
- Yeah, Jill.
- Oh.

1187
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:42,865
- Gee, that's wonderful, Jill.
- Thank you.

1188
01:15:43,622 --> 01:15:46,080
Just wonderful.

1189
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:57,296
Hi. What are we doing?

1190
01:15:57,386 --> 01:16:02,097
Uh, Johnny, M-Mr. Karpf needed a ride home,
and I said we'd take him.

1191
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:05,051
- Uh, you don't mind, do you?
- Oh, of course not.

1192
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:07,056
Hey, call me Les, huh?

1193
01:16:08,189 --> 01:16:09,680
Where to, Les?

1194
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:14,309
Well, listen, would you kids like
to stop off for a drink?

1195
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:17,567
Well, we'd love to,
but we're going to another party.

1196
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,648
Oh, that's wonderful.

1197
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:22,234
I'll stop off there for a drink. Hmm?

1198
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,338
You never were a tit man though, were you?

1199
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:44,593
Ass and legs.

1200
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,217
Look who's talking.

1201
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:54,478
Do you know why
I used to get so angry with you?

1202
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:58,278
Oh, I wouldn't settle down.

1203
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:03,950
'Cause you were always so happy...
about everything.

1204
01:17:05,371 --> 01:17:06,862
I was?

1205
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:10,331
I found it rather unrealistic.

1206
01:17:14,171 --> 01:17:15,753
Your type.

1207
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,840
Very nice. Mmm.

1208
01:18:56,941 --> 01:19:00,059
- You want children?
- Oh, I don't really think about it that much.

1209
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:04,863
I mean, there's so much to do
and so many places to go while I'm still free.

1210
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:07,441
You know, um, unattached.

1211
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:56,970
We're kiddin' ourselves.

1212
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:00,562
We are?

1213
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:05,316
You know, last night I had a dream.

1214
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,779
I was, uh, 50 years old,

1215
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:13,074
and, uh, I was supposed
to meet Jill at the shop.

1216
01:21:15,454 --> 01:21:17,241
Ooh.

1217
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:18,947
Scared the hell out of me.

1218
01:21:20,584 --> 01:21:21,620
Why?

1219
01:21:26,173 --> 01:21:29,382
I can't imagine being with Jill
when I'm 50 years old.

1220
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:39,225
I can't imagine not being with you.

1221
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:38,526
Two weeks from tomorrow.

1222
01:22:42,624 --> 01:22:44,616
You're kidding.

1223
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,372
Really?

1224
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:52,170
Uh, I really don't know how to say this,

1225
01:22:52,259 --> 01:22:55,423
but... would you like to come home with me?

1226
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:14,399
Hi.

1227
01:23:15,282 --> 01:23:17,319
Hi!

1228
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:18,945
Come on in.

1229
01:23:20,496 --> 01:23:22,488
Yeah?

1230
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:24,823
Why not, huh?

1231
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:39,592
You know, we really shouldn't leave
that poor man here by himself.

1232
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:41,764
Les? He wouldn't know the difference.

1233
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:44,092
I know, but still,
let's go tell him we're gonna go, huh?

1234
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:45,768
- Well, uh...
- Come on.

1235
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,642
Uh, say...

1236
01:23:49,608 --> 01:23:50,689
What is it, man?

1237
01:23:52,402 --> 01:23:54,689
- Where can I get a towel?
- Over by the tennis court.

1238
01:23:58,909 --> 01:24:00,320
Thanks.

1239
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:29,763
Oh.

1240
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:38,480
- Uh, Les, Les.
- Shh.

1241
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:42,359
That's what I call fucking.

1242
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:48,323
Am I right, or am I right?

1243
01:24:50,294 --> 01:24:52,752
Come on, Les. Let's get out of here.

1244
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:08,017
Oh, my God.

1245
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:13,310
- You bastard!
- Oh, hey. Where've you been?

1246
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:15,187
We've been looking everywhere for you.

1247
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:18,566
You... son of a bitch!

1248
01:25:18,655 --> 01:25:20,271
Jill?

1249
01:25:21,408 --> 01:25:22,694
Baby?

1250
01:25:25,621 --> 01:25:29,410
Oh, Jesus, what should I do?
Uh, I better... I better go get her. Wait here.

1251
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:31,866
Wait here. Jill!

1252
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,872
Jill!

1253
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:36,670
Honey. Jill!

1254
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:43,632
Jill!

1255
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:37,648
Jackie? Honey?

1256
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:40,194
Shit.

1257
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:42,770
Jackie?

1258
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:45,193
Jackie!

1259
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,202
Jackie!

1260
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:55,787
Jackie!

1261
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:00,375
Jackie!

1262
01:27:16,773 --> 01:27:18,059
Jill?

1263
01:27:21,862 --> 01:27:23,273
Jill?

1264
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:34,364
Oh. Yeah, this is George Roundy speaking.

1265
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:37,246
And I left a message there
a little earlier for Jackie.

1266
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:39,543
Has she picked it up yet?

1267
01:27:39,629 --> 01:27:41,120
Uh-huh.

1268
01:27:44,342 --> 01:27:47,335
No. No, just tell her I called twice.
Thank you.

1269
01:28:27,594 --> 01:28:29,677
- Want me to come in with you?
- No.

1270
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:33,214
- Well, I'll call you in a few minutes, okay?
- All right.

1271
01:28:56,289 --> 01:28:58,121
I don't want to fight, George.

1272
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:01,827
I don't want to fight either.
Look. Uh, I-I'm sorry.

1273
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,207
Bullshit.

1274
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:08,792
- Why didn't he come in?
- Because I didn't want him to.

1275
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:12,085
Well, I hope he doesn't mind me being here.
Did you get a job out of it at least?

1276
01:29:13,014 --> 01:29:15,006
I'd like you to leave now.

1277
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:18,773
And take this with you.

1278
01:29:21,898 --> 01:29:23,514
Where did this come from?

1279
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:25,691
Who knows? I'm sure you don't.

1280
01:29:25,777 --> 01:29:28,485
But if it'll help any,
I found it in your bed.

1281
01:29:31,658 --> 01:29:34,196
Obviously, there were others.
Weren't there?

1282
01:29:36,955 --> 01:29:38,787
Obviously.

1283
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,615
- How many?
- What do you want to know for?

1284
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:42,812
- Because I want to know. That's all.
- What difference does it make?

1285
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:47,547
Because... I don't want girls looking at me
and knowing and me not knowing.

1286
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:49,569
- Please don't do this.
- No, it'll help me, really.

1287
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:50,862
- Please?
- It'll help me if you tell me.

1288
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:51,717
How?

1289
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:54,716
Because I'll know
that you've lied to me all along.

1290
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:58,553
And I'll know that you're incapable of love,

1291
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,054
and that'll help me.

1292
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:15,532
If it'll do any good,

1293
01:30:15,619 --> 01:30:18,327
I just... You know, I-I have...

1294
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:21,247
- You really want to know?
- Yes.

1295
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,619
There were a couple of...
I mean, there were, uh...

1296
01:30:26,713 --> 01:30:29,956
Jesus. I-I-I... There were just...

1297
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,551
Let's face it. I fucked them all.

1298
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:37,342
I mean, that's what I do.

1299
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:39,173
That's why I went to beauty school.

1300
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:42,726
I mean, they were always there,
and I can't... I-I just... I-I...

1301
01:30:43,438 --> 01:30:45,350
Uh, you know, I-I...

1302
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,558
I don't know what I'm apologizing for.
So sometimes I fuck 'em.

1303
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:54,071
I... I go into that shop,
and they're so great-looking. You know?

1304
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:57,776
And I... And I... I'm doing their hair,
and they feel great, and they smell great.

1305
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,723
Or I could be out in the street, you know,
and I just stop at a stoplight,

1306
01:31:00,747 --> 01:31:02,784
or go into an elevator, or I...

1307
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:05,412
There's a, uh... beautiful girl.

1308
01:31:05,502 --> 01:31:07,118
I-I-I don't know.

1309
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:09,329
I mean, that's it. It makes my day.

1310
01:31:09,422 --> 01:31:13,166
I mean, it makes me feel
like I'm gonna live forever.

1311
01:31:14,344 --> 01:31:18,088
And as far as I'm concerned with what I've
liked to have done at this point in my life,

1312
01:31:18,181 --> 01:31:20,673
I-I know I should have accomplished more,
but I got no regrets.

1313
01:31:20,767 --> 01:31:23,851
I mean, Jesus, 'cause I-I...
I mean, I, um...

1314
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:27,020
I...

1315
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:32,394
Maybe that means I don't love 'em.

1316
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:35,859
Maybe it means I don't love you.
I don't know.

1317
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:39,779
Nobody's gonna tell me
I don't <i>like</i> 'em very much.

1318
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:46,449
Jesus.

1319
01:31:54,092 --> 01:31:55,583
Well.

1320
01:31:57,429 --> 01:31:58,920
I'm glad you told me.

1321
01:32:08,148 --> 01:32:09,684
And I wish you'd go now.

1322
01:32:50,607 --> 01:32:55,318
Hi. Um, no. No, no.
Everything's fine, really.

1323
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:18,211
<i>The interim period between now
and the inauguration</i>

1324
01:33:18,301 --> 01:33:24,389
<i>of any activity that may be helpful
in bringing the peace for a while.</i>

1325
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:28,680
<i>I also told him that,</i>

1326
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:31,228
<i>as he finished his campaign,</i>

1327
01:33:31,898 --> 01:33:34,140
<i>I know exactly how he felt.</i>

1328
01:33:34,234 --> 01:33:36,351
<i>I know how it feels to lose a close one.</i>

1329
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:39,312
How long you been here?

1330
01:33:39,405 --> 01:33:40,896
All night.

1331
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:44,237
You live like a pig.

1332
01:33:45,787 --> 01:33:47,278
Yeah.

1333
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:50,080
Kyle, wait outside.

1334
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:55,870
<i>Having lost a close one eightyears ago
and having won a close one this year,</i>

1335
01:33:55,964 --> 01:33:58,923
<i>I can say that winning's a lot more fun.</i>

1336
01:33:59,008 --> 01:34:00,840
Who are those guys?

1337
01:34:00,927 --> 01:34:02,919
What do they look like?

1338
01:34:05,431 --> 01:34:08,048
You unhappy about something, Lester?

1339
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:10,718
Sit down.

1340
01:34:10,812 --> 01:34:13,145
- Well, now, wait a minute...
- I said sit down!

1341
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:21,107
Now, George, either you admit it
to my face, man to man,

1342
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:23,189
or I'm gonna have them
pound it out of you.

1343
01:34:23,283 --> 01:34:25,511
- And they do a hell of a job, believe me.
- Yeah, I-I believe you.

1344
01:34:25,535 --> 01:34:27,527
All right, I want to know about it.

1345
01:34:28,246 --> 01:34:29,612
Ah, Jesus.

1346
01:34:29,706 --> 01:34:31,698
I want to know how a guy like you thinks.

1347
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:34,875
Look, just have them put me away,
or whatever they're gonna do. I'm...

1348
01:34:34,961 --> 01:34:37,314
What, do you get your kicks
sneaking around behind people's backs,

1349
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:39,079
taking advantage of them?

1350
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:41,587
Is that your idea
of being antiestablishment?

1351
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,668
I'm not antiestablishment.

1352
01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:46,001
Well, was it me?
What, did you have something against me?

1353
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:47,546
What, do you think I planned it?

1354
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,723
Jackie, Felicia. Ugh.

1355
01:34:49,809 --> 01:34:51,471
Did <i>they</i> have something against me?

1356
01:34:51,561 --> 01:34:54,099
I'm sure you've done something
they could be pissed off about.

1357
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:56,101
Well, goddamn it,
I want to hear it from you!

1358
01:34:56,191 --> 01:34:58,210
How am I going to tell you
what they've got against you?

1359
01:34:58,234 --> 01:35:00,647
I mean, Christ, they're women, aren't they?

1360
01:35:00,737 --> 01:35:03,571
Do you ever listen to women talk, man?
Do you?

1361
01:35:03,656 --> 01:35:05,426
'Cause I do till it's running out of my ears.

1362
01:35:05,450 --> 01:35:07,810
I mean, I'm on my feet all day long
listening to women talk,

1363
01:35:07,869 --> 01:35:10,953
and they only talk about one thing...
how some guy fucked them over.

1364
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:14,407
That's all that's on their minds.
That's all I ever hear about.

1365
01:35:14,500 --> 01:35:16,583
Don't you know that?

1366
01:35:16,669 --> 01:35:19,457
Well, I follow your thinking on that.

1367
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:22,665
I mean, face it. We're always
trying to nail 'em, and they know it.

1368
01:35:22,759 --> 01:35:24,500
They don't like it.

1369
01:35:24,594 --> 01:35:26,586
They like it, and they don't like it.

1370
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:30,514
It's got nothing to do with you, Lester.
It just happened.

1371
01:35:31,768 --> 01:35:34,431
Felicia's got nothing to do
but shop and get her hair done.

1372
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,280
She's getting older, her daughter hates her.

1373
01:35:36,356 --> 01:35:37,847
Wait a minute.

1374
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,562
You think Lorna hates her?

1375
01:35:43,446 --> 01:35:46,050
Oh, I don't think she hates her.
I mean, she may resent her a little, but...

1376
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:49,488
- Are you kidding, man? She hates her.
- Why?

1377
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:52,612
I mean, why is that?

1378
01:35:52,705 --> 01:35:54,697
How would I know?

1379
01:35:57,919 --> 01:35:59,410
I don't know. I...

1380
01:36:06,052 --> 01:36:08,760
You want a drink?

1381
01:36:08,846 --> 01:36:10,587
No, thanks.

1382
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:12,890
- Have a drink.
- Okay. Thanks.

1383
01:36:14,269 --> 01:36:16,761
Not a clean glass in the whole house.

1384
01:36:17,814 --> 01:36:19,601
Jesus Christ, what a way to live.

1385
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:24,318
I never lived like this,
not even when I was your age.

1386
01:36:25,029 --> 01:36:27,237
Not even when I never had a dime.

1387
01:36:30,326 --> 01:36:34,570
It's a hell of a way to treat a business partner,
that's all I can say.

1388
01:36:34,664 --> 01:36:36,496
Who?

1389
01:36:36,582 --> 01:36:38,289
Me.

1390
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:41,244
Hey, you were never gonna
give me the money.

1391
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:43,788
I was going to give you the money.

1392
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:45,756
Probably I would have.

1393
01:36:47,468 --> 01:36:49,380
Shit, I don't know.

1394
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:54,511
I don't know anything anymore.

1395
01:36:57,854 --> 01:36:59,766
But you never know, you know?

1396
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:02,564
I mean, one minute you're here,
and the next, pfft.

1397
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:04,725
I wish...

1398
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:10,398
I just wish I knew
what the hell I was living for.

1399
01:37:10,491 --> 01:37:12,608
<i>A teenager held up a sign...</i>

1400
01:37:12,702 --> 01:37:14,318
<i>"Bring Us Together."</i>

1401
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:21,456
<i>And that will be the great objective
of this administration at the outset...</i>

1402
01:37:22,086 --> 01:37:23,918
<i>to bring the American people together.</i>

1403
01:37:24,005 --> 01:37:25,005
Hmm.

1404
01:37:25,089 --> 01:37:27,797
<i>This will be an open administration.
Open to new ideas.</i>

1405
01:37:27,884 --> 01:37:29,500
You can lose it all, you know.

1406
01:37:29,594 --> 01:37:31,594
I mean, you can lose it all,
no matter who you are.

1407
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:33,762
What's the sense of having it all?

1408
01:37:35,224 --> 01:37:37,591
Market went down ten points last week.

1409
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:39,517
Goddamn Lyndon Johnson.

1410
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:42,183
Yeah. Well...

1411
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:44,731
<i>We want to bring America together.</i>

1412
01:37:44,817 --> 01:37:46,809
Maybe Nixon will be better.

1413
01:37:48,071 --> 01:37:51,155
What's the difference?
They're all a bunch of jerks.

1414
01:37:54,494 --> 01:37:56,110
I don't know what to do with you.

1415
01:37:58,331 --> 01:38:00,698
I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.

1416
01:38:03,294 --> 01:38:05,752
At least you do what you want.

1417
01:38:05,838 --> 01:38:07,670
Me? I'm...

1418
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:09,123
Shit.

1419
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:11,083
What about Jackie?

1420
01:38:12,303 --> 01:38:15,011
Ah, never mind. She's nothing but a whore.

1421
01:38:15,098 --> 01:38:19,058
I go over there, I have a few drinks,
I get my gun off, I'm through with her.

1422
01:38:19,143 --> 01:38:20,850
- Nothing but a whore.
- Oh, no.

1423
01:38:20,937 --> 01:38:23,020
You could call everybody a whore.

1424
01:38:23,106 --> 01:38:26,315
She really likes you, Lester.
It's not just the bread.

1425
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:29,651
You think so?

1426
01:38:30,405 --> 01:38:31,896
Yes, I do.

1427
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:33,981
Nah, I'm through with her.

1428
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:47,829
Oh, uh, by the way,
you want me to say hello to Lorna for you?

1429
01:38:52,176 --> 01:38:53,712
What the hell. Go easy on him.

1430
01:38:59,725 --> 01:39:02,433
- Just having a little fun, George.
- Oh.

1431
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:05,512
Come on, Hal. Let's go home.

1432
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:09,065
Listen, I'll call you tomorrow
about the shop.

1433
01:39:12,822 --> 01:39:14,438
Christ, I'm beat.

1434
01:39:23,749 --> 01:39:25,490
Devra? Devra.

1435
01:39:25,585 --> 01:39:28,480
I want you to call Jackie Shawn
and keep trying her until you get her, okay?

1436
01:39:28,504 --> 01:39:30,712
Mrs. Schumann and Mrs. Young
are both waiting for you.

1437
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:32,755
Mrs. Young is kind of uptight.

1438
01:39:32,842 --> 01:39:34,754
She's on the Rolodex. Will you get her?

1439
01:39:34,844 --> 01:39:36,335
Sorry.

1440
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:39,838
- Where's Mary?
- She's with Norman.

1441
01:39:41,684 --> 01:39:44,768
I asked you to call Jackie.
Would you do it, please?

1442
01:39:44,854 --> 01:39:47,221
- Mary's gonna have to wash you.
- Not today.

1443
01:39:47,315 --> 01:39:50,315
What are you talking about now?
What the hell is going on around here? Mary!

1444
01:39:50,902 --> 01:39:52,393
Mary?

1445
01:39:52,487 --> 01:39:54,695
Mary! I'm not the shampoo girl, you know.

1446
01:39:54,780 --> 01:39:57,509
Do you think you can give me a little help?
What's the matter with Norman?

1447
01:39:57,533 --> 01:40:00,822
George, settle down.
Norman's son was killed.

1448
01:40:02,747 --> 01:40:04,659
- Killed?
- Car accident.

1449
01:40:13,382 --> 01:40:14,873
Near Oceanside.

1450
01:40:15,259 --> 01:40:18,627
He was on his way back to Camp Pendleton
and, uh, it was foggy,

1451
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:21,213
and some guy in his truck
jumped the divider on the freeway.

1452
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:23,014
It happened instantly.

1453
01:40:24,227 --> 01:40:25,718
Lord have mercy.

1454
01:41:01,973 --> 01:41:04,181
Just a minute. Almost ready.

1455
01:41:10,982 --> 01:41:12,974
Where you going?

1456
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:15,775
Oh! Um, you'll have to go.

1457
01:41:16,988 --> 01:41:19,275
- I gotta leave?
- Oh, honey, you have to get out of here.

1458
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:22,783
- Why?
- Lester's on his way.

1459
01:41:24,745 --> 01:41:26,236
Where are you going?

1460
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:28,697
Oh, please. We'll talk about it later, huh?

1461
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:31,283
Well, honey, uh, about last night...

1462
01:41:31,377 --> 01:41:34,791
Oh, forget about last night. It's okay.
We'll talk when I get back.

1463
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:38,419
It's not okay. I mean, I want to talk now.
Where are you going?

1464
01:41:38,509 --> 01:41:40,125
Look, either you leave or I leave.

1465
01:41:40,219 --> 01:41:43,219
But I don't want the two of us to be here
when Lester arrives. I just don't.

1466
01:41:46,767 --> 01:41:48,474
That's him.

1467
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:53,959
It's a cleaner.

1468
01:41:53,983 --> 01:41:55,724
That's it. Then I'm leaving.

1469
01:42:02,617 --> 01:42:03,983
Honey.

1470
01:42:04,076 --> 01:42:05,192
Oh!

1471
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:08,490
Cleaners!

1472
01:42:08,581 --> 01:42:09,742
Honey?

1473
01:42:10,416 --> 01:42:13,329
Honey?

1474
01:43:46,554 --> 01:43:48,796
- You're gonna kill me.
- Honey?

1475
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:50,801
What are you trying to do?

1476
01:43:54,103 --> 01:43:55,844
I want you to marry me.

1477
01:43:57,189 --> 01:44:01,524
I-I want to take care of you.
I-I want you to have a baby with me.

1478
01:44:02,153 --> 01:44:04,193
Hey, I know I'm a fuckup,
but I'll take care of you.

1479
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:05,918
I'll make you happy.
I swear to God I will.

1480
01:44:07,074 --> 01:44:08,565
Huh?

1481
01:44:09,034 --> 01:44:11,117
Honey?

1482
01:44:11,203 --> 01:44:12,785
What do you think?

1483
01:44:16,333 --> 01:44:18,245
It's too late.

1484
01:44:18,753 --> 01:44:20,731
What do you mean it's too late?
We're not dead yet.

1485
01:44:20,755 --> 01:44:22,291
That's the only thing that's too late.

1486
01:44:24,842 --> 01:44:26,333
Lester's left Felicia.

1487
01:44:26,427 --> 01:44:29,295
We're going to Acapulco
on the four o'clock flight.

1488
01:44:29,388 --> 01:44:31,004
He's asked me to marry him.

1489
01:44:35,352 --> 01:44:36,593
Well...

1490
01:44:39,315 --> 01:44:40,806
Honey.

1491
01:44:42,818 --> 01:44:44,309
Honey, please.

1492
01:44:46,071 --> 01:44:47,278
Please, honey.

1493
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:50,815
I...

1494
01:44:50,910 --> 01:44:52,321
Honey.

1495
01:44:53,579 --> 01:44:55,696
I... I...

1496
01:44:57,708 --> 01:45:00,041
I don't trust anybody but you.

1497
01:45:02,671 --> 01:45:04,162
Baby.

1498
01:45:32,910 --> 01:45:34,071
Lester's at the house.

1499
01:45:35,454 --> 01:45:37,286
Don't go, honey. Please don't.

1500
01:45:38,123 --> 01:45:40,763
But I have to go. I have to.
I can't just leave him standing there.

1501
01:45:40,835 --> 01:45:43,669
Oh, I have to go. I have to... I have to go.

1502
01:47:07,838 --> 01:47:10,000
Well, the puppies are in the car.

1503
01:47:12,009 --> 01:47:17,300
I can't think of anything else,
so... why don't we just take off, huh?

1504
01:47:18,766 --> 01:47:19,973
Okay?
