1
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,661
Thank you very much, sir.

2
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:20,913
You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.

3
00:01:20,998 --> 00:01:23,374
Shh. Shh.

4
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,876
We did it, Pete. We did it.

5
00:01:26,962 --> 00:01:28,671
- For a moment, we had our doubts.
- Shh.

6
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:32,175
To continue, you've listened
to a long and complex case -

7
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,051
murder in the first degree.

8
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:39,098
A premeditated murder is the most serious
charge tried in our criminal courts.

9
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:40,933
You've listened to the testimony.

10
00:01:41,018 --> 00:01:43,936
You've had the law read to you and
interpreted as it applies in this case.

11
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:48,024
It's now your duty to sit down and try
and separate the facts from the fancy.

12
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,487
One man is dead. Another
man's life is at stake.

13
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,283
If there's a reasonable doubt in your
minds as to the guilt of the accused -

14
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,285
a reasonable doubt -

15
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,163
then you must bring me
a verdict of not guilty.

16
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,123
Now if, however, there's
no reasonable doubt...

17
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:08,085
then you must in good conscience
find the accused guilty.

18
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:13,341
However you decide, your
verdict must be unanimous.

19
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:16,803
In the event that you
find the accused guilty...

20
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:20,223
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.

21
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,518
The death sentence is
mandatory in this case.

22
00:02:23,602 --> 00:02:27,313
You're faced with a grave
responsibility. Thank you, gentlemen.

23
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,359
The alternate jurors are excused.

24
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,367
The jury will now retire.

25
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,362
Try this one. See if I can get it -

26
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,448
It's a muggy day.

27
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:48,079
Hey. Oh, oh.

28
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,218
- Piece of gum?
- No, thanks.

29
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,387
This thing is -

30
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,097
- Huh?
- ... move it.

31
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,892
- Come on, I'll give you a hand.
- Give me a hand with that.

32
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:11,310
That's it.

33
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,567
- You know something?
- Yeah?

34
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,403
I called the weather
bureau this morning.

35
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,405
This is gonna be the
hottest day of the year.

36
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,073
Could be.

37
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,075
Boy, you'd think they'd at
least air-condition these places.

38
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,495
- What is your name, sir? -
Oh, it's, uh - That one, yeah.

39
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,997
Thank you very much.

40
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,833
Okay, gentlemen, everybody's here.

41
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,752
Now, if there's anything you want,
I'll be right outside the door.

42
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,088
- Just knock.
- Okay, thanks. We will.

43
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,810
Good morning.

44
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,353
I never knew they locked the door.

45
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:56,605
Sure they lock the
door. What'd you think?

46
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,109
I don't know. It just
never occurred to me.

47
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:03,529
What's that for?

48
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,489
Oh, I thought we might
want to vote by ballot.

49
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,242
Great idea. Maybe we can
get him elected senator.

50
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,246
Just in case, you know.

51
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,877
- Î—ow'd you like it?
- Oh, I don't know.

52
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,628
It was pretty interesting.

53
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,672
Yeah? I almost fell asleep.

54
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:24,341
I mean, I've never
been on a jury before.

55
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,136
No? I've sat on many juries.

56
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,223
What gets me is the way those
lawyers talk and talk and talk...

57
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,476
even when it's an open-and-shut
case like this one.

58
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,269
Did you ever hear so
much talk about nothin'?

59
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,229
Well, I guess they're entitled.

60
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,774
Yeah. They're entitled.
It's the system, but -

61
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:45,071
If you ask me, I'd slap those tough
kids down before they start any trouble.

62
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,239
It would save us a
lot of time and money.

63
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,866
- Hey, let's get started, huh?
- That's a good idea.

64
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,577
Yeah, let's get goin', huh? We
probably all got things to do here.

65
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,705
I figured we'd start out with a five-minute
break. There's one gentleman in the bathroom.

66
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,748
- Mr. Foreman.
- Huh?

67
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,626
- Are, uh - Are we gonna sit
in order? - Gee, I don't know.

68
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,461
I, uh
- Well, I guess so.

69
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,926
Uh, you're in my seat.

70
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,011
- Oh. Excuse me.
- That's all right.

71
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,307
Hey, that's not a bad view, huh?

72
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,396
What did you think of the case?

73
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,524
I mean, it had a lot of interest for me.

74
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,735
No real... dead spots.
You know what I mean?

75
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:28,072
I tell you, we were lucky
to get a murder case.

76
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,116
I figured us for an assault or burglary.

77
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,451
Boy, they can be the dullest.

78
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,329
Hey.

79
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,997
That the Woolworth Building?

80
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,999
That's right.

81
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,668
Isn't that funny?

82
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:43,129
You know, I've lived here all my
life. I've never been inside that.

83
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,297
If you had to sort out all that junk -

84
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,466
Like that thing with the movies.

85
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,553
Yeah. You can say that again. And what
about that business with the knife?

86
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,514
I mean, asking grown-up people
to believe that kind of jazz, huh?

87
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,058
Well, I expected that. You
know what we're dealing with.

88
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,602
Yeah, I guess so.

89
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,396
Well, your horn works.
Now try your lights.

90
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,524
- What do you got, a cold?
- And how.

91
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,818
These hot-weather colds can kill you.

92
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,320
I can hardly touch my
nose. You know what I mean?

93
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,949
I sure do. I just got over one.

94
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,785
Aw, come on. Mr. Foreman,
let's go here, huh?

95
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,495
Well, that guy's still in the bathroom.

96
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,415
Hey, what's new? I didn't get a
chance to see a paper this morning.

97
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,583
Hmm?

98
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,085
I was only wondering
how the market closed.

99
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,880
You got a seat on the Exchange?

100
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,715
I'm a broker.

101
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:32,178
I run a messenger service
- the Beck and Call Company.

102
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,388
The name is my wife's idea.

103
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,100
Got 37 men working.
Started with nothing.

104
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:41,353
Okay, men, let's take our seats, huh?

105
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,358
Yeah, we can all get outta
here pretty quick, huh?

106
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,653
I don't know about the rest of you, but I
happen to have tickets to that ball game tonight.

107
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,572
Yanks and Cleveland.

108
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:53,449
Yeah, we got this kid,
Modjelewski, in there.

109
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,201
Ooh, he's a real bull, this kid.

110
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,411
You know
- Phoom!

111
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,747
A real jug handle. You know?

112
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,082
Phoom!

113
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:04,501
You're a real baseball
fan, aren't you? Huh? Yeah.

114
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:06,045
Where do we sit here?

115
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,215
Well, I thought we'd sit in
order, you know, by jury numbers.

116
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,717
One, two, three, four, five
- so on, around the table.

117
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,052
If that's okay with you gentlemen.

118
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,220
- Sure.
- What's the difference?

119
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,348
- I think it's reasonable to sit in order.
- Let it be.

120
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,683
- Number 12. Do I sit down here?
- Yeah. That's 12. We go around -

121
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:23,020
- We start with you. One, right?
- One, yeah. Two, three, four, five, six.

122
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,439
What was your impression
of the prosecuting attorney?

123
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,233
Okay. Two. You're two.

124
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,484
I beg pardon?

125
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:32,738
I thought he was really sharp, the way
he handled all those points one by one.

126
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,950
Logical sequence. I was very impressed.

127
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:39,036
I think he
- he did an expert job.

128
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,122
A lot of drive too,
you know? Real drive.

129
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:44,291
- Okay, fellas, can we hold it down a minute?
- Sure.

130
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,960
Uh, fellas.

131
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:49,505
Say, we'd like to get started.
Gentleman at the window.

132
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,342
- We'd like to get started.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

133
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:57,096
Pretty tough to figure, isn't it? Kid kills his father
- bing, just like that.

134
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,765
Aw, listen, you analyze the figures,
you'll see it happens all the time.

135
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,767
They let those kids run wild up there.

136
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,561
Well, maybe it serves 'em
right. You know what I mean?

137
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,230
Is
- Is everyone here?

138
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,148
The old man is inside.

139
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:10,859
Oh. Would you, uh, knock
on the door for him?

140
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:12,903
You a Yankee fan?

141
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,530
No. Baltimore.

142
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,949
- Baltimore?
- Yeah.

143
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,786
That's like being hit in the
head with a crowbar once a day.

144
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,789
Who have they got?

145
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,292
No, I mean, who have they got
besides good groundskeepers?

146
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,918
Say, uh, we'd like to get started.

147
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,046
Oh, forgive me, gentlemen. I
- I didn't mean to keep you waiting.

148
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,632
Baltimore?

149
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,510
Okay, gentlemen, if I
can have your attention.

150
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,555
You fellas can handle this
thing any way that you want to.

151
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,141
I'm, um
- You know, I'm not gonna make any rules.

152
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,519
Uh, we can, well, discuss it
first and, uh, then vote on it.

153
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,272
That's, of course, uh
- That's, uh, one way.

154
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:51,317
And, uh, well, we can
vote on it right now, and -

155
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,902
I think it's customary to
take a preliminary vote.

156
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,573
Yeah, let's
- Let's vote. Who knows? Maybe we all can get outta here, huh?

157
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,366
Uh-huh.

158
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:02,536
Okay, then I think that, uh -

159
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,497
Of course you know that we have a
first-degree murder charge here...

160
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,666
and if we vote the accused guilty...

161
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:11,003
uh, we've got to send him to the chair.

162
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,840
- Um, that's mandatory.
- I think we know that.

163
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,675
- Let's see who's where.
- We might as well.

164
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,554
- Okay. Uh, anyone doesn't want to vote?
- All right with me.

165
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:26,352
Okay. Then, uh, just remember that
this has to be 12 to nothing either way.

166
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:27,895
Um, that's the law.

167
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,022
Okay, are we ready?

168
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,108
Now, all those voting guilty,
please raise your hands.

169
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,616
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

170
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,536
eight, nine, 10, 11.

171
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,539
Okay. That's 11 guilty.

172
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,124
Those voting not guilty.

173
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:52,378
One. Right.

174
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,755
That's 11 guilty. One not guilty.

175
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,257
Well, now we know where we are.

176
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:01,512
Boy, oh, boy. There's always one.

177
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,348
So, what do we do now?

178
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,266
Well, I guess we talk.

179
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,684
Boy, oh, boy.

180
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,603
You really think he's innocent?

181
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,608
I don't know.

182
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:17,569
I mean, you sat in court with the
rest of us. You heard what we did.

183
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,780
The kid's a dangerous
killer. You could see it.

184
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,490
He's 18 years old.

185
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,659
Well, that's old enough. Î—e -

186
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:26,412
He stabbed his own father
four inches into the chest.

187
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,747
They proved it a dozen
different ways in court.

188
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,375
Would you like me to list them for you?

189
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:32,751
No.

190
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,920
Then what do you want?

191
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:37,923
- I just want to talk.
- What's there to talk about?

192
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,341
Eleven men in here think he's guilty.

193
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,677
No one had to think
about it twice except you.

194
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,972
I want to ask you something.
Do you believe his story?

195
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,766
I don't know whether I believe
it or not. Maybe I don't.

196
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:49,435
So how come you vote not guilty?

197
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,437
Well, there were 11 votes for guilty.

198
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,273
It's not easy to raise my hand
and send a boy off to die...

199
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,442
without talking about it first.

200
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,944
- Well, now, who says it's easy?
- No one.

201
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,406
What, just because I voted fast?

202
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,908
I honestly think the guy's guilty.

203
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,786
You couldn't change my mind if
you talked for a hundred years.

204
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,872
I'm not trying to change
your mind. It's just that -

205
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,708
We're talking about
somebody's life here.

206
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,877
We can't decide it in five
minutes. Supposing we're wrong.

207
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,378
"Supposing we're wrong. "

208
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,464
Supposing this whole building
should fall down on my head.

209
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,549
- You can suppose anything.
- That's right.

210
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:23,135
Look, what's the difference
how long it takes?

211
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,804
Suppose we do it in
five minutes. So what?

212
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,015
Let's take an hour.

213
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,017
The ball game doesn't start till 8:00.

214
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,896
Hmm?

215
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,900
Who's got something to say?

216
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,401
I'm willing to sit for an hour.

217
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:42,196
Great. I heard a pretty
good story last night.

218
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,364
That's not why we're sitting here.

219
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,619
All right, then you tell me.
What are we sitting here for?

220
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:51,705
I don't know. Maybe no reason.

221
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:56,168
Look, this kid's been kicked
around all of his life -

222
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:00,172
you know, born in a slum,
mother dead since he was nine.

223
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,466
He lived for a year and a
half in an orphanage when his -

224
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,469
his father was serving
a jail term for forgery.

225
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,888
It's not a very happy beginning.

226
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,098
He's a
- a wild, angry kid.

227
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:11,892
That's all he's ever
been. And you know why?

228
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,687
'Cause he's been hit on the head
by somebody once a day every day.

229
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,981
He's had a
- He's had a pretty miserable 18 years.

230
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,026
I
- I just think we owe him a few words. That's all.

231
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,655
I don't mind telling you this,
mister. We don't owe him a thing.

232
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,824
He got a fair trial, didn't he?
What do you think that trial cost?

233
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,994
- He's lucky he got it. You know what I mean?
- You know it.

234
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,413
Now, look, we're all grown-ups in here.

235
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,374
We heard the facts, didn't we?

236
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:39,253
You're not gonna tell me that we're supposed
to believe this kid, knowing what he is.

237
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:41,713
Listen, I've lived
among them all my life.

238
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:45,133
You can't believe a word
they say. You know that.

239
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,052
I mean, they're born liars.

240
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,472
- Only an ignorant man can
believe that. - Now listen -

241
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,392
Do you think you were born
with a monopoly on the truth?

242
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:56,061
I think certain things should
be pointed out to this man.

243
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,230
Come on. This isn't Sunday.
We don't need a sermon.

244
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,566
Come on. We have a job
to do. Now let's do it.

245
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,653
Rice Pops. It's a product
I work on at the agency.

246
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,115
"The breakfast with
the built-in bounce. "

247
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,825
- I wrote that line.
- Very catchy.

248
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,077
- Yeah.
- Say, do you mind?

249
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,870
Oh, I'm sorry.

250
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:16,415
I have this habit of doodling.
Keeps me thinking clearly.

251
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:18,208
Yeah, we have all this work to do.

252
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,002
- There's no point staying here forever.
- Sorry.

253
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,296
Okay. Um...

254
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,174
perhaps if the gentleman down
there who's disagreeing with us -

255
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,553
Well, perhaps you could tell us why. You
know, let us know what you're thinking.

256
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,014
And we might be able to show
you where you're mixed up.

257
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:33,765
Well, look, maybe
- Maybe this is an idea.

258
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,268
Now, I haven't given it much
thought, but it seems to me...

259
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:40,772
that it's up to the group of us to convince
this gentleman that he's wrong and we're right.

260
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,400
Now, maybe if we each took
a couple of minutes just to -

261
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:46,236
Well, it was just a quick idea.

262
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,779
No, no, no. That's a good one.

263
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,949
Uh, suppose we go once around the table.

264
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,910
- I guess you're first.
- Oh.

265
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,329
Well, uh -

266
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,291
Well, it-it's hard to put into words.

267
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,336
I just think he's guilty.

268
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,921
I thought it was obvious
from the word "go. "

269
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:06,506
I mean, nobody proved otherwise.

270
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:08,133
Nobody has to prove otherwise.

271
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,469
The burden of proof's
on the prosecution.

272
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,013
The defendant doesn't even
have to open his mouth.

273
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:16,224
- That's in the Constitution.
- Oh, well, sure, I know that.

274
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,268
Uh, what I meant was, is -

275
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,064
Well, I just think he's guilty.

276
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,857
I
- I mean, somebody saw him do it.

277
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:28,987
Okay. Uh, here's what I think, and I
have no personal feelings about this.

278
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,239
I just want to talk about facts.

279
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,368
Number one.

280
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:39,039
The old man lived downstairs under
the room where the killing took place.

281
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,249
At 10 minutes after 12:00 on
the night of the killing...

282
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,003
he heard loud noises, said
it sounded like a fight.

283
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,964
And he heard the kid yell
out, "I'm gonna kill ya. "

284
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,342
A second later, he heard
a body hit the floor.

285
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,135
Ran to the door, opened it up...

286
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,638
saw the kid running down the
stairs and out of the house.

287
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,014
Called the police.

288
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,767
They came in, found the old
man with a knife in his chest.

289
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,104
The coroner fixed the time
of death around midnight.

290
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,273
Now these are facts.
You can't refute facts.

291
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,526
The kid is guilty.

292
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,611
I'm just as sentimental
as the next fella.

293
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:13,573
I know he's only 18, but he's
still gotta pay for what he did.

294
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,117
I'm with you.

295
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,744
Okay. Are you finished?

296
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,287
- Yeah.
- Right. Next.

297
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,582
It is obvious, to me anyway, that
the boy's entire story was flimsy.

298
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,876
He claimed he was at the movies
during the time of the killing...

299
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:27,504
and yet, one hour later, he couldn't
remember the names of the films he saw...

300
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,423
- or who played in them.
- That's right.

301
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,800
And no one saw him going
in or out of the theater.

302
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,510
Listen, what about the
woman across the street?

303
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,887
If her testimony don't
prove it, nothing does.

304
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:38,306
That's right. She was the one
who actually saw the killing.

305
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,809
Now, fellas, please. Let's
go in order here, huh?

306
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,146
Just a minute. Here's a woman -

307
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,690
Here's a woman who was lying
in bed. She can't sleep.

308
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,692
She's dying with the
heat. You know what I mean?

309
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,610
Anyway, she looks out the window...

310
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:54,281
and right across the street she sees
the kid stick the knife into his father.

311
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,242
The time is 12:10 on the nose.

312
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,202
Everything fits.

313
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,121
Look, she's known the kid all his life.

314
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,331
His window is right opposite
hers across the el tracks...

315
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,083
and she swore she saw him do it.

316
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,836
- Through the windows of the passing el train.
- Right.

317
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:12,090
This el train had no passengers on
it. It was just being moved downtown.

318
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,093
The lights were out, remember? And
they proved in court that, at night...

319
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,596
you can look through the windows of
an el train when the lights are out...

320
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,015
and see what's happening
on the other side.

321
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,934
- They proved it.
- I'd like to ask you something.

322
00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:25,687
You don't believe the boy's story.
How come you believe the woman's?

323
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,522
She's one of them too, isn't she?

324
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:32,194
You're a pretty smart fella, aren't you?

325
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,695
- Okay, gentlemen.
- Now, now.

326
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,989
- Now, gentlemen.
- Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

327
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,617
Oh, what's he so wise
about? I'm telling you.

328
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,953
Okay, now come on. Now we're
not gonna get anywhere fighting.

329
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,288
Whose turn is it next?

330
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,208
Oh, uh, his. Number five.

331
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:51,213
Okay, may I -
Can I pass? It -

332
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,049
Well, uh, that's your privilege.

333
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,260
Uh, how about the next gentleman?

334
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,013
Oh. Well, uh, I don't know.

335
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:04,309
I started to be convinced, you
know, very early in the case.

336
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:09,022
You see, I was looking for a
motive. That's very important.

337
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:13,318
Because if you don't have a
motive, where's your case, right?

338
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,488
Anyway, that, uh, testimony
from those people...

339
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,616
in the apartment across the
hall from the kid's apartment -

340
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,952
that was very powerful.

341
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:24,830
Didn't they say something about a
- a fight and an argument...

342
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:29,334
between the old man and his son
around about, uh, 7:00 that night?

343
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,878
- I mean, I could be wrong,
but I - - It was 8:00.

344
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:34,005
It was 8:00. That's right.
They heard an argument.

345
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,841
They couldn't hear what it was about.

346
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,884
Then they heard the
father hit the boy twice.

347
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:40,929
- Finally they saw the boy
run angrily out of the house.

348
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,597
What does that prove?

349
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:46,351
Well, it don't exactly prove anything.
It's just part of the picture.

350
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,354
Well, you said it provided a motive. The
prosecuting attorney said the same thing.

351
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:51,690
I don't think that was
a very strong motive.

352
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,360
This boy's been hit so many times in
his life that violence is practically a -

353
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,821
It's a normal state of affairs with him.

354
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:02,117
I just
- I can't see two slaps in the face provoking him into committing murder.

355
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,787
It may have been two too many.
Everyone has a breaking point.

356
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,417
Anything else?

357
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,961
- No.
- Okay.

358
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,796
Uh, how about you?

359
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,592
I don't know. It's all been said.

360
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,762
You can talk here forever.
It's still the same thing.

361
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,933
This kid is five for 0.

362
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,894
Well, look at his record.

363
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:31,187
When he was 10, he was
in children's court.

364
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:33,064
He threw a rock at a teacher.

365
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,442
When he was 15, he was in reform school.

366
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,360
He stole a car.

367
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:39,946
He's been arrested for mugging.

368
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,032
He was picked up twice
for knife fighting.

369
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,200
Oh, yeah, they say he's
real handy with a knife.

370
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,078
Oh, this is a very fine boy.

371
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:50,165
Ever since he was five years old,
his father beat him up regularly.

372
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,667
- He used his fists.
- Well, so would I.

373
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,252
A kid like that?

374
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:57,505
It's these kids, the
way they are nowadays.

375
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:03,178
When I was a kid, I used
to call my father "sir. "

376
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,221
That's right. "Sir. "

377
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:07,265
Do you ever hear a kid call
his father that anymore?

378
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,851
Fathers don't seem to think
it's important anymore.

379
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,687
- You got any kids?
- Three.

380
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,398
I got one.

381
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,652
Twenty-two years old.

382
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,535
When he was nine years old,
he ran away from a fight.

383
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,415
I saw it. I was so
embarrassed I almost threw up.

384
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:38,713
I said, "I'm gonna make a man out of you
if I have to break you in two trying. "

385
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,134
Well, I made a man out of him.

386
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,304
When he was 16, we had a fight.

387
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,266
Hit me in the jaw. He was a big kid.

388
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,772
Haven't seen him for two years.

389
00:21:57,692 --> 00:21:59,985
Kids.

390
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,655
Work your heart out.

391
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,492
Well, let's get going.

392
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,911
I think we're missing the point here.

393
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:13,415
This boy, let's say he's the product of
a broken home and a filthy neighborhood.

394
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:17,085
We can't help that. We're here to
decide whether he's innocent or guilty...

395
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,088
not to go into the reasons
why he grew up the way he did.

396
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,882
He was born in a slum. Slums are
breeding grounds for criminals.

397
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,843
I know it, and so do you.

398
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:29,639
It's no secret children from slum
backgrounds are potential menaces to society.

399
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,891
- Now I think - - Brother,
you can say that again.

400
00:22:31,976 --> 00:22:34,519
The kids who crawl out of
these places are real trash.

401
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,855
- I don't want any part of them. I'm telling you.
- Listen, mister. Listen.

402
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:40,650
- I, uh - I've lived in a slum
all my life. - Wait a minute.

403
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:44,154
Please, I
- I played in backyards that were filled with garbage.

404
00:22:44,238 --> 00:22:46,281
I mean, maybe you can
still smell it on me.

405
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,699
Now, listen, sonny.

406
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,367
Come on now. There's
nothing personal about this.

407
00:22:49,452 --> 00:22:51,995
- No, there was something personal.
- Aw, come on, fella. He didn't mean you.

408
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,164
Let's not be so sensitive.

409
00:22:54,248 --> 00:22:56,082
This sensitivity I can understand.

410
00:22:56,167 --> 00:23:00,795
Okay, look, let's stop the arguing.
We're only wasting time, and -

411
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,090
Look, your turn down there. Let's go.

412
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,261
Oh, I didn't expect a turn. I thought
you were all gonna try to convince me.

413
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,096
- Wasn't that the idea?
- Check. That was the idea.

414
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:12,390
- Oh, I forgot about that. He's right.
- What difference does it make?

415
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,809
He's the one who's keeping us in
here. Let's hear what he's got to say.

416
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,604
Oh, now wait a minute. We
decided to do this a certain way.

417
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,314
I think we ought to stick to that way.

418
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,399
Oh, stop being a kid, will you?

419
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,485
- What do you mean "a kid"?
- What do you think I mean?

420
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,195
K- I-D.
Kid.

421
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:31,451
What? Listen, just because I'm
trying to keep this thing organized?

422
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,661
Here, you take it. You
take on the responsibility.

423
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,622
I'll just
- I'll keep my mouth shut. That's all.

424
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,707
What are you getting so hot
about? Calm down, will you?

425
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:39,125
Don't tell me to calm down.

426
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,336
Here. You wanna take the chair,
just take the chair. That's all.

427
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,880
- Did you ever see such a thing?
- See if you can keep it running.

428
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,924
- Listen, you think it's funny or something?
- Hey, forget it, fella.

429
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:47,592
The whole thing's unimportant. Come on.

430
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,804
- Unimportant? Oh, here, you try it.
- No, nobody wants to change.

431
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:52,639
You're doing a beautiful job. Sit down.

432
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,558
Yeah, you're doing
great. Just great, fella.

433
00:23:55,643 --> 00:23:57,519
You stay in there and pitch. You know?

434
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,688
All right. Let's hear from somebody.

435
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:06,277
Well, if you want me to tell you how I
feel about it, it's all right with me.

436
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,488
Boy, I don't care what you do.

437
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,449
All right, I don't
have anything brilliant.

438
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,660
I only know as much as you do.

439
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:17,497
According to the testimony, the
boy looks guilty. Maybe he is.

440
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:21,751
I sat there in court for six days
listening while the evidence built up.

441
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,087
Everybody sounded so positive, you know?

442
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,631
I
- I began to get a peculiar feeling about this trial.

443
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,800
I mean, nothing is that positive.

444
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,010
There are a lot of questions
I'd have liked to ask.

445
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:33,805
I don't know. Maybe they wouldn't
have meant anything, but -

446
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,849
I began to get the feeling
that the defense counsel...

447
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,434
wasn't conducting a
thorough-enough cross-examination.

448
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,896
I mean, he - he let too many
things go by, little things that -

449
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,732
What little things? Listen, when
these fellas don't ask questions...

450
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:47,318
it's because they know the answers
already and they figure they'll be hurt.

451
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:51,322
Maybe it's also possible for a lawyer
to be just plain stupid, isn't it?

452
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:52,699
I mean it's possible.

453
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,450
You sound like you met
my brother-in-law once.

454
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,248
I
- I kept putting myself in the kid's place.

455
00:25:02,084 --> 00:25:04,210
I'd have asked for
another lawyer, I think.

456
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:06,838
I mean, if I was on trial for my life...

457
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:11,718
I'd want my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds, or at least try to.

458
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:15,763
Look, there was one alleged
eyewitness to this killing.

459
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:19,684
Someone else claims he heard the
killing, saw the boy run out afterwards.

460
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,895
And there was a lot of
circumstantial evidence.

461
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,481
But actually, those two witnesses were
the entire case for the prosecution.

462
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,358
Supposing they're wrong.

463
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:29,235
What do you mean
supposing they're wrong?

464
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,196
What's the point of
having witnesses at all?

465
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,907
- Could they be wrong?
- What are you trying to say?

466
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,533
Those people sat on
the stand under oath.

467
00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,160
They're only people.
People make mistakes.

468
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,953
Could they be wrong?

469
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:42,665
- Well, no, I don't think so.
- Do you know so?

470
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,584
Oh, come on. Nobody can
know a thing like that.

471
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,377
This isn't an exact science.

472
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:47,795
That's right. It isn't.

473
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:55,720
Okay, let
- Let's get to the point.

474
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,389
What about the switch knife they
found in the old man's chest?

475
00:25:58,474 --> 00:26:00,892
Uh, wait-wait a minute. There's
some people who haven't talked yet.

476
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,977
- Shouldn't we go in order?
- They'll get a chance to talk.

477
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,396
Be quiet a second, will you?

478
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,773
What about it, this -

479
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:10,318
the knife this fine upright boy
admitted buying the night of the killing?

480
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,736
Let's talk about it.

481
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,072
All right, let's talk about it.
Let's get it in here and look at it.

482
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,907
I'd like to see it again. Mr. Foreman?

483
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,077
We all saw what it looks like.
Why do we have to see it again?

484
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,120
The gentleman has a right
to see exhibits in evidence.

485
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:24,791
Say, could you bring us the knife?

486
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,668
- Knife?
- Yeah. Thank you.

487
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:31,589
The knife and the way it was bought is
pretty strong evidence, don't you think?

488
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,341
- I do.
- Good.

489
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,927
Now, suppose we take
these facts one at a time.

490
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:39,264
One. The boy admitted going out of the
house at 8:00 on the night of the murder...

491
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,266
after being slapped
several times by his father.

492
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:44,102
No, no. No, he didn't say
"slapped. " He said "punched. "

493
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:46,604
There's a difference
between a slap and a punch.

494
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:49,274
After being hit several
times by his father.

495
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,609
Two. He went directly to
a neighborhood junk shop...

496
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,820
- where he bought one of
those - - Switch knives.

497
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,905
Switchblade knives.

498
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,782
This wasn't what you'd
call an ordinary knife.

499
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,368
It had a very unusual
carved handle and blade.

500
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,953
The storekeeper who sold it to him...

501
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:05,164
said it was the only one of its
kind he had ever had in stock.

502
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:09,002
Three. He met some friends of his
in front of a tavern about 8:45.

503
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:10,586
Am I right so far?

504
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,797
- Yes, you are.
- You bet he is.

505
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,050
He talked with his friends for
about an hour, leaving them at 9:45.

506
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,095
During this time, they
saw the switch knife.

507
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,972
Four.

508
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,474
They identified the
death weapon in court...

509
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:26,060
as that very same knife.

510
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,938
Five. Î—e arrived home at about 10:00.

511
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,357
Now this is where the stories
offered by the State and the boy...

512
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,359
begin to diverge slightly.

513
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,029
He claims that he went to
a movie at about 11:30...

514
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:40,158
returning home at 3:10 to find his
father dead and himself arrested.

515
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,285
He also claims that the two
detectives who arrested him...

516
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,662
threw him down a half
a flight of stairs.

517
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:46,581
Now, what happened to the switch knife?

518
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,292
He claims that it fell through a hole
in his pocket on the way to the movies...

519
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:54,047
sometime between 11:30 and 3:10
and that he never saw it again.

520
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:56,090
Now there's a tale, gentlemen.

521
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:59,677
I think it's quite clear that the boy
never went to the movies that night.

522
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,721
No one in the house
saw him go out at 11:30.

523
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,306
No one at the theater identified him.

524
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,516
He couldn't even remember the
names of the pictures he saw.

525
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,271
- What actually happened is this.
- Thank you.

526
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:13,566
The boy stayed home, had
another fight with his father...

527
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,362
stabbed him to death and left the
house at 10 minutes after 12:00.

528
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,198
He even remembered to wipe the
knife clean of fingerprints.

529
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,909
Now are you trying to
tell me that this knife...

530
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,911
really fell through a
hole in the boy's pocket...

531
00:28:24,995 --> 00:28:27,372
someone picked it up off the
street, went to the boy's house...

532
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:30,124
and stabbed his father with
it just to test its sharpness?

533
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,210
No. I'm just saying it's
possible the boy lost his knife...

534
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,504
and that somebody else stabbed
his father with a similar knife.

535
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:35,797
It's just possible.

536
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,465
Take a look at this knife.

537
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,594
It's a very unusual knife.

538
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,221
I've never seen one like it.

539
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:46,099
Neither had the storekeeper
who sold it to the boy.

540
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:49,143
Aren't you asking us to accept
a pretty incredible coincidence?

541
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,562
I'm just saying a
coincidence is possible.

542
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:53,147
And I say it's not possible.

543
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,489
Where did that come from?

544
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,949
- Where'd you get that?
- It's the same knife.

545
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,534
What do you think you're doing?

546
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,244
Where did you get it?

547
00:29:06,328 --> 00:29:08,579
I went out walking for a
couple of hours last night.

548
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:10,665
I walked through the boy's neighborhood.

549
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,751
I bought that at a little pawnshop
just two blocks from the boy's house.

550
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,294
It cost six dollars.

551
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:18,506
It's against the law to buy
or sell switchblade knives.

552
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,842
That's right. I broke the law.

553
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:24,929
Listen, you pulled a real bright trick.
Now, supposing you tell me what it proves.

554
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,098
Maybe there are 10
knives like that. So what?

555
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,976
- Maybe there are.
- Well, what does it mean?

556
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,354
You found another knife like it. What's
that, the discovery of the age or something?

557
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,773
You mean you're asking us to believe
that somebody else did the stabbing...

558
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:37,650
with exactly the same kind of knife?

559
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,985
The odds are a
million-to-one.

560
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:41,779
- It's possible.
- But not very probable.

561
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,991
Okay, fellas, let's take our seats.

562
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:46,701
There's no point in standing
around all over the place.

563
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:52,165
You know, it's interesting that he'd find
a knife exactly like the one the boy bought.

564
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:55,001
What's interesting
about it? "Interesting. "

565
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:56,961
Well, I don't know. I just
thought it was interesting.

566
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,838
There are still 11 of us
here who think he's guilty.

567
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:01,215
Right. What do you think
you're gonna accomplish?

568
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,134
You're not gonna change anybody's mind.

569
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,595
So if you wanna be stubborn
and hang this jury, go ahead.

570
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,723
The kid will be tried again and
found guilty sure as he's born.

571
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,143
That's probably right.

572
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,438
So what are you gonna do? You
know, we could be here all night.

573
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:18,774
It's only one night. A boy may die.

574
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,402
Well, why don't we just
set up house here, huh?

575
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,946
Someone send for Potsy the
policeman and get a pinochle deck...

576
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,532
and, uh, we'll just sweat the
whole thing out right here.

577
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:31,078
- I don't think he ought to joke about it.
- What do you want me to do about it?

578
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:34,832
Oh, listen! I don't see what all this stuff
about the knife's got to do with anything.

579
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:37,835
Somebody saw the kid stab his
father. What more do we need?

580
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,713
You guys can talk the ears right
off my head. You know what I mean?

581
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,508
I got three garages of mine
goin' to pot while you're talking.

582
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:45,259
So let's get done and get outta here.

583
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,763
The knife was very important to the
district attorney. He spent a whole day -

584
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,307
He's a 15th assistant or something.
What does he know about it?

585
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,850
Hey, let's hold it down.

586
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:55,269
These side arguments
are only slowing us up.

587
00:30:58,148 --> 00:30:59,524
Well, what about it?

588
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,108
You're the only one.

589
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,077
I have a proposition
to make to all of you.

590
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:13,913
I'm gonna call for another vote.

591
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:20,586
I want you 11 men to vote
by secret written ballot.

592
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,713
I'll abstain.

593
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:25,591
If there are 11 votes for
guilty, I won't stand alone.

594
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:29,470
We'll take in a guilty
verdict to the judge right now.

595
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:34,642
But if anyone votes not guilty,
we stay here and talk it out.

596
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,898
Well, that's it. If you
want to try it, I'm ready.

597
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:42,441
All right. Let's do it the hard way.

598
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:44,443
Okay, that sounds fair. Everyone agreed?

599
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:46,612
- Anyone doesn't agree?
- Fine, fine. Let's go.

600
00:31:46,697 --> 00:31:47,738
Here, pass these along.

601
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,574
Is that the right time?

602
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:47,465
"Guilty. "

603
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:54,180
"Not guilty. "

604
00:32:54,264 --> 00:32:55,681
"Guilty. "

605
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:57,433
Boy, how do you like that?

606
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,977
Oh, and another chap flaps his wings.

607
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:02,813
All right, who was it?
Come on. I want to know.

608
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,149
Excuse me. This was a secret ballot.

609
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,776
We all agreed on that, no?

610
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,986
If the gentleman wanted
to remain secret -

611
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:10,946
Secret? What do you mean secret?

612
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:14,241
There are no secrets in a
jury room. I know who it was.

613
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,911
Brother, you really are something.

614
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,996
You sit here, vote guilty
like the rest of us...

615
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:22,375
and then some golden-voiced preacher
starts tearin' your poor heart out...

616
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:25,753
about some underprivileged kid just
couldn't help becomin' a murderer...

617
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,338
and you change your vote.

618
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,548
If that isn't the most sick -

619
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:33,302
Why don't you drop a quarter
in his collection box?

620
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,346
Oh, now just wait a minute.

621
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,014
Listen, you can't talk to me like that.

622
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:38,933
- No. Who do you think you are?
- Calm down. Calm down.

623
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,352
No. Who does he think
he is? Did you hear him?

624
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,897
- It doesn't matter. He's very excitable. Sit down.
- Excitable? You bet I'm excitable!

625
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,817
We're trying to put a guilty man
in the chair where he belongs!

626
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,569
Someone starts telling us fairy
tales, and we're listenin'!

627
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,405
Hey, uh, come on, huh?

628
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,407
What made you change your vote?

629
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:56,117
He didn't change his vote.

630
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,368
I did.

631
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,412
- Oh, fine.
- I knew it.

632
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:01,455
Would you like me to tell you why?

633
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,416
No, I wouldn't like you to tell me why.

634
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,043
I'd like to make it clear
anyway, if you don't mind.

635
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,628
Do we have to listen to this?

636
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,463
The man wants to talk.

637
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:11,132
Thank you.

638
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:14,552
This gentleman has been
standing alone against us.

639
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,887
Now, he doesn't say
the boy is not guilty.

640
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:18,931
He just isn't sure.

641
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:21,851
Well, it's not easy to stand alone
against the ridicule of others.

642
00:34:21,935 --> 00:34:25,062
So he gambled for support,
and I gave it to him.

643
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:26,856
I respect his motives.

644
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,485
The boy on trial is probably
guilty, but, uh, I want to hear more.

645
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,362
Right now, the vote is 10 to two.

646
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:35,698
I'm talking here! You have
no right to leave this room!

647
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,658
He can't hear you. He never will.

648
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:39,326
Let's sit down.

649
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,708
Shall we continue?

650
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,002
Well, I
- I think we ought to take a break.

651
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:52,214
You know, one man's inside, and
I think we ought to wait for him.

652
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,259
Okay.

653
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,094
Looks like we're really
hung up here, huh?

654
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:00,806
And that thing with the old
man, that was pretty unexpected.

655
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,352
I wish I could figure out
some way we could break it up.

656
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:11,942
You know, in advertising
- I told you I worked in an agency.

657
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:13,027
Mm-hmm.

658
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,112
Well, there's some pretty
strange people working there.

659
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,281
Well, they're not
strange really, I guess.

660
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,992
It's just that they have peculiar
ways of expressing themselves.

661
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,327
You know what I mean.

662
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:23,621
Of course, I suppose it's the
same in your business too, huh?

663
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,873
What do you do?

664
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,125
- I'm a watchmaker.
- Oh, really?

665
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,420
Well, I imagine the finest watchmakers
in the world come from Europe, huh?

666
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:34,507
Anyway, as I was telling you, in an
agency, when we reach a point like this -

667
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,093
I'm telling him about, in an ad agency, when
a point like this is reached in a meeting...

668
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,805
there's always some character
ready with an idea, see.

669
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,848
And it kills me.

670
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,433
It's the weirdest thing in the world...

671
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:47,853
the way they sometimes precede their
idea with a little phrase, see, like -

672
00:35:47,938 --> 00:35:50,856
Some account exec will get
up, and he'll say, uh...

673
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:52,775
"Okay, here's an idea.

674
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:56,487
Let's, uh, run it up the flagpole
and see if anyone salutes it. "

675
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,698
I mean, it's idiotic,
but it's funny, huh?

676
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:04,286
I, uh - I got a little
excited back there. I -

677
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,039
didn't mean to get nasty.

678
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:11,710
I'm glad you're not one of those lets
these emotional appeals influence him.

679
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,130
Uh -

680
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:31,105
I don't know what's the matter with
that fan. Can't seem to get it to start.

681
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:35,025
# Be, be, be #

682
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,194
# Ba, ba, ba, ba, bum ##

683
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,697
Eh!

684
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,033
Hey, you a salesman?

685
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,618
I'm an architect.

686
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,787
Hmm.

687
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:49,123
You know what the soft sell is?

688
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,961
Boy, you got it. Believe me.

689
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,339
I got a different technique.

690
00:36:58,133 --> 00:36:59,925
Laughs, drinks, jokes.

691
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:02,261
Tricks. You know?

692
00:37:03,096 --> 00:37:04,305
Yeah.

693
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,975
"Hit 'em where they
live. " That's my motto.

694
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:12,146
I made 27 grand last
year sellin' marmalade.

695
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,482
That's not bad. I mean, you
know, considering marmalade.

696
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:20,487
Hey, what are you gettin' outta this
- kicks?

697
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,242
Or did somebody bump you on the head
one time and you haven't gotten over it?

698
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:27,036
Maybe.

699
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,581
You know, you do-gooders are all alike.

700
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:33,334
You're always blowing your
stacks over some guy that fanned.

701
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,255
But what are you wasting our time for?

702
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:43,052
Why don't you donate five dollars to the
cause, and maybe it'll make you feel better.

703
00:37:46,348 --> 00:37:48,599
This kid is guilty, pal.

704
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,101
It's as plain as the nose on your face.

705
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,437
So why don't we stop
wasting our time here?

706
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:56,440
We're gonna all get sore throats
if we keep it up, you know?

707
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,817
What difference does it make if
you get it here or at the ball game?

708
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,780
Oh, no difference, pal.

709
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,657
No difference at all.

710
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:07,993
##

711
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,462
Nice bunch of guys, huh?

712
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,839
Oh, they're about the
same as anyone else.

713
00:38:20,924 --> 00:38:23,717
Phew! Boy, what a murderous day.

714
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,762
You think we'll be much longer?

715
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,472
I don't know.

716
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,474
Aw, he's guilty for sure.

717
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,101
Not a doubt in the whole world.

718
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,728
We should
- Should've been done already.

719
00:38:36,982 --> 00:38:38,232
Oh, I don't mind, you know.

720
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,734
Hmm. Beats workin'.

721
00:38:44,406 --> 00:38:45,572
Uh -

722
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:50,035
You think he's not guilty, huh?

723
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,954
I don't know. It's possible.

724
00:38:52,706 --> 00:38:56,500
Well, I don't know you, but I'm bettin'
you never been wronger in your life.

725
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,003
You're wasting your time.
You ought to wrap it up.

726
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:01,255
Supposing you were the
one who was on trial.

727
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,966
Well, I'm not used to supposing.

728
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:08,554
I'm just a workingman. My
boss does the supposing. But -

729
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,139
Well, I'll try one.

730
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:17,021
Supposing you talk us all out of this, and,
uh, the kid really did knife his father. Huh?

731
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,239
Are you ready?

732
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,532
Hup.

733
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,533
That one.

734
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,285
Sorry, blue eyes.

735
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,622
- Well, where else - - Okay,
fellas, let's take our seats.

736
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,624
Looks like we'll be
here for dinner, huh?

737
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:40,085
Okay, now let's
- Let's get down to business.

738
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,545
Now, who wants to start it off?

739
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,047
- I would.
- Okay, go.

740
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:45,215
You down there.

741
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:49,178
The old man who lived downstairs says he
heard the kid yell out, "I'm gonna kill ya. "

742
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:51,889
A second later, he heard
the body hit the floor.

743
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:55,851
Now, he ran to the door and he saw the kid
running down the stairs and out of the house.

744
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,311
What does that mean to you?

745
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,773
I was wondering how clearly the old man could
have heard the boy's voice through the ceiling.

746
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,900
He didn't hear it through the
ceiling. The window was open.

747
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:04,818
So was the one upstairs. It
was a hot night, remember?

748
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,236
Well, it was another apartment.

749
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:08,906
It's not that easy to identify a
voice, particularly a shouting voice.

750
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,574
- He identified it in court.
- That's right.

751
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:12,117
And don't forget the
lady across the street.

752
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,995
She looked right in the open window
and saw the boy stab his father.

753
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,539
- Now, I mean, isn't that enough for you?
- No, it isn't.

754
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:19,583
Boy, how do you like this guy, huh?

755
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,502
It's like talking into a dead phone.

756
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,755
She said she saw the killing through
the windows of a moving elevated train.

757
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:28,342
There were six cars on the train. She
saw the killing through the last two cars.

758
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,260
She remembered the most
insignificant details.

759
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,387
I don't see how you can argue with that.

760
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:37,017
Has anybody here any idea
how long it would take an el -

761
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,277
Hey!

762
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,862
This isn't a game.

763
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,410
- Did you see him?
- Hey.

764
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,246
- The nerve. -
All right, listen -

765
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:00,582
- The absolute nerve.
- Forget it. It's not important.

766
00:41:00,667 --> 00:41:02,626
- "This isn't a game"?
- Calm down.

767
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:06,046
- Who does he think he is?
- I'm telling you, forget it now.

768
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,466
Has anybody any idea how long
it takes an elevated train...

769
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:11,385
going at medium speed
to pass a given point?

770
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,345
- What has that to do with anything?
- How long? Take a guess.

771
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,098
- I wouldn't have the slightest idea.
- What do you think?

772
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,058
I don't know. Maybe 10, 12 seconds?

773
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,727
I think that's a pretty
good guess. Anyone else?

774
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,605
- That sounds right to me.
- Come on. What's the guessing game for?

775
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,524
- What do you say?
- Ten seconds is about right.

776
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,526
All right. Say 10 seconds.
What are you getting at?

777
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:32,656
This. It takes a six-car el train
10 seconds to pass a given point.

778
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,994
Now let's say the given point is the open
window of the room where the killing took place.

779
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:40,372
You can reach out of that window and
almost touch the el tracks, right?

780
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,957
Now let me ask you this.

781
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,293
Has anyone here ever
lived near the el tracks?

782
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:48,005
Well, uh, I just finished painting an
apartment that overlooked an el line.

783
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:49,756
- I was there for three days.
- What was it like?

784
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,008
- What do you mean?
- Noisy?

785
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,635
Oh, brother. Don't matter
though. We were all punchy.

786
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,305
I lived in a second-floor
apartment near the el line once.

787
00:41:56,389 --> 00:41:59,433
When the window was open and the train
goes by, the noise is almost unbearable.

788
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:02,352
- You can hardly hear yourself think.
All right, you can't hear yourself think.

789
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:04,855
- Will you get to the point?
- I will. Now just a minute.

790
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:08,567
Let's take two pieces of testimony
and try to put them together.

791
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:12,738
First. The old man in
the apartment downstairs.

792
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,407
He says he heard the boy
say "I'm gonna kill you"...

793
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:18,243
and a split second later
heard a body hit the floor.

794
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:19,912
- One second later, right?
- That's right.

795
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:26,001
Second. The woman across the street swore
positively she looked out of the window...

796
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,421
and saw the killing through the last two
cars of the passing elevated train, right?

797
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,840
- The last two cars.
- What are you giving us here?

798
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:33,258
Now, just a minute.

799
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:37,763
We've agreed that it takes 10 seconds
for a train to pass a given point.

800
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,934
Since the woman saw the killing
through the last two cars...

801
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:46,980
we can assume that the body hit
the floor just as the train went by.

802
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:51,526
Therefore, the train had been
roaring by the old man's window...

803
00:42:51,611 --> 00:42:55,113
a full 10 seconds before
the body hit the floor.

804
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:57,407
The old man, according
to his own testimony -

805
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:00,410
"I'm gonna kill you," body hitting
the floor a split second later -

806
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,955
would have had to hear the
boy make this statement...

807
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,915
with the el roaring past his nose.

808
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,541
It's not possible he could've heard it.

809
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,794
- That's idiotic. Of course he heard it.
- Do you think he could've heard it?

810
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:11,255
He said he yelled at the top of his
voice. That's good enough for me.

811
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,590
Even if he heard something, he still
couldn't have identified the voice.

812
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:14,800
With the el roaring by?

813
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:17,261
You're talking about a matter of
seconds! Nobody can be that accurate.

814
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:21,974
I think testimony that could put a boy into
the electric chair should be that accurate.

815
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:26,103
You know something? I don't
think he could've heard it.

816
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,522
Maybe he didn't hear it. I
mean, with all that el noise.

817
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,482
Oh, what are you people talking about?

818
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,609
Well, it stands to reason
he couldn't have heard it.

819
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,611
Why should he lie?
What's he got to gain?

820
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,905
Attention maybe.

821
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,907
You keep coming in with
these bright sayings!

822
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:42,035
Why don't you send 'em in to a
paper? They pay three dollars apiece.

823
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,329
What are you talking
to him like that for?

824
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,709
Guy talks like that to an old man
really ought to get stepped on, you know?

825
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,627
You ought to have more respect, mister.

826
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,216
If you say stuff like that to
him again, I'm gonna lay you out.

827
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,146
Now you go ahead. You
- You say anything you like.

828
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:13,275
Why do you think the old man might lie?

829
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,778
It was just that I looked
at him for a very long time.

830
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:20,657
The seams of his jacket was
split, under the shoulder.

831
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:22,326
Or did you notice that?

832
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,911
I mean, to come to court like that.

833
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:26,663
Why -

834
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,668
He was a very old man in a torn jacket.

835
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:34,629
And he walked very slowly to the stand.

836
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:39,426
He was dragging his left
leg and trying to hide it -

837
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,178
because he was ashamed.

838
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,724
I think I know this man
better than anyone here.

839
00:44:46,601 --> 00:44:52,022
This is a quiet, frightened,
insignificant old man who -

840
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,483
who has been nothing all his life...

841
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,985
who has never had recognition...

842
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,154
or his name in the newspapers.

843
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,032
Nobody knows him.

844
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,159
Nobody quotes him.

845
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:08,205
Nobody seeks his advice after 75 years.

846
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,918
Gentlemen, that's a very sad thing
- to be nothing.

847
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:17,964
A man like this needs to be
quoted, to be listened to.

848
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,550
To be quoted just once.

849
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:22,511
Very important to him.

850
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,430
It would be so hard for him
to recede into the background -

851
00:45:25,515 --> 00:45:27,224
- Wait a minute. - When
there was a chance -

852
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:30,185
What are you trying to do
- tell us he'd lie just so he could be important once?

853
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:32,896
No. He wouldn't really lie.

854
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:36,441
But perhaps he made himself
believe he heard those words...

855
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,735
and recognized the boy's face.

856
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,113
That's the most fantastic
story I've ever heard.

857
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:44,241
How can you make up a thing like
that? What do you know about it?

858
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,335
Oh, uh, does anybody want a cough drop?

859
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,671
- No, thanks.
- I'll take one.

860
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:01,258
You can say what you like. I still don't
see how anybody can think he's not guilty.

861
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,844
There's something else I'd
like to talk about for a minute.

862
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,554
Thanks.

863
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:08,932
I think we've proved that the old man couldn't
have heard the boy say "I'm gonna kill you. "

864
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,600
- But supposing - - You
didn't prove it at all.

865
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:13,478
- What are you talking about?
- Supposing he really did hear it.

866
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:15,981
This phrase, how many times
have all of us used it?

867
00:46:16,065 --> 00:46:17,566
Probably thousands.

868
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,276
"I could kill you for that, darling. "

869
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,278
"Junior, you do that once
more, and I'm gonna kill you. "

870
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:22,654
"Get in there, Rocky, and kill him. "

871
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,614
We say it every day. That doesn't
mean we're really gonna kill anybody.

872
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,491
Wait a minute. What are
you trying to give us here?

873
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:30,287
The phrase was "I'm gonna kill you. "
The kid yelled it at the top of his lungs.

874
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:31,705
Don't tell me he didn't mean it.

875
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,082
Anybody says a thing like that
the way he said it, they mean it.

876
00:46:34,167 --> 00:46:35,625
Well, gee, now I don't know.

877
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:40,422
I remember I was arguing with a guy I work
next to at the bank a couple weeks ago.

878
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,257
He called me an idiot,
so I yelled at him.

879
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,302
Now listen! This guy's trying to make
you believe things that aren't so.

880
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:47,471
The kid said he was gonna
kill him, and he did kill him.

881
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:50,515
Let me ask you this. Do you really think
the boy would shout out a thing like that...

882
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,392
so the whole neighborhood
could hear him?

883
00:46:52,477 --> 00:46:54,311
I don't think so. He's
much too bright for that.

884
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:59,149
Bright? He's a common ignorant slob.
He don't even speak good English.

885
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:02,068
"He doesn't even speak good English. "

886
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,325
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to
change my vote to not guilty.

887
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:09,826
You what?

888
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:12,329
- You heard me.
- Are you sure?

889
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,664
Yeah, I'm sure.

890
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,209
The vote is nine to
three, favor of guilty.

891
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,086
Well, if this isn't the living end. Huh?

892
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,885
What are you basing it on
- the stories this guy made up?

893
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,846
You ought to write for one of
those kooky detective magazines.

894
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:31,765
You'd make a fortune.

895
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:35,268
For crying out loud. The kid's own
lawyer knew he didn't stand a chance.

896
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,354
Right from the beginning,
his own lawyer knew it.

897
00:47:37,438 --> 00:47:39,231
You could see it.

898
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:42,901
Boy, oh, boy. I'm tellin' you,
this guy here is really something.

899
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,529
Look, the kid had a lawyer, didn't he?

900
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:48,448
He presented his case, not you.
How come you got so much to say?

901
00:47:48,533 --> 00:47:51,368
- Look, lawyers aren't infallible, you know.
- Baltimore, please. Huh?

902
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:53,161
He was court-appointed.

903
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:55,080
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It could mean a lot of things.

904
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:58,416
It could mean he didn't want the
case, or he resented being appointed.

905
00:47:58,501 --> 00:48:00,335
It's the kind of case
that brings him nothing -

906
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,380
no money, no glory, not
even much chance of winning.

907
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:06,383
That's not a very promising
situation for a young lawyer.

908
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:09,386
He'd really have to believe in his client
to put up any kind of a good case...

909
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,471
and, as you pointed out a
minute ago, obviously he didn't.

910
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,391
Of course he didn't. Huh.

911
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:16,768
Who the heck could?

912
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,771
Except maybe some guy's
mother or somebody. I -

913
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,107
Ah, look. Will you
look at the time, huh?

914
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:24,734
- Come on. For crying
out - - Pardon me.

915
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:27,153
- I have made some
notes here - - Notes.

916
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:29,864
and I would like to
- please, to say something.

917
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:32,200
- Yeah.
- I have been listening very carefully.

918
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:36,705
And, uh, it seems to me that this
man has some very good points to make.

919
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:41,418
From what was presented at the trial,
the boy looks guilty on the surface.

920
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:45,589
- But maybe if we go deeper?
- Oh, come on, will ya?

921
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,966
There is a question I would like to ask.

922
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:51,344
Let us assume that the boy
really did commit the murder.

923
00:48:51,429 --> 00:48:54,764
Now, this happened at
10 minutes after 12:00.

924
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,309
Now, how was he caught by the police?

925
00:48:57,393 --> 00:49:01,896
He came back home, uh, at 3:00 or so...

926
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:05,734
and he was captured by two detectives
in the hallway of his house.

927
00:49:05,818 --> 00:49:10,405
Now, my question is, if he
really had killed his father...

928
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,700
why would he come back
home three hours later?

929
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,661
Wouldn't he be afraid of being caught?

930
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:18,496
He came home to get his knife.

931
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:21,124
It's not nice to go around leaving
knives sticking in people's chests.

932
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,960
- Yeah, especially relatives.
- Yeah.

933
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:26,296
I don't see anything funny about it.

934
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:29,924
The boy knew the knife could be
identified as the one he had just bought.

935
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,177
He had to get it before the police did.

936
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:36,723
But if he knew the knife could be identified,
why did he leave it there in the first place?

937
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:40,143
Well, I think we can assume the
boy ran out in a state of panic...

938
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,604
after having just killed his father.

939
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,649
When he finally calmed down, he
realized he had left his knife there.

940
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,652
Ah. This then depends on
your definition of panic.

941
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:51,112
He would have had to be
calm enough to see to it...

942
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,782
that there were no
fingerprints left on the knife.

943
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:57,911
Now, where did this panic
start and where did it end?

944
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,372
Look, you voted guilty.
What side are ya on?

945
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:04,000
I don't believe I have to be
loyal to one side or the other.

946
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,877
I'm simply asking questions.

947
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,963
Well, this is just off the
top of my head, but, uh...

948
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:11,549
well, if I were the boy and I'd
done the stabbing and everything...

949
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,760
I'd take a chance and
go back for the knife.

950
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,346
I'll bet he figured that nobody
had seen him running out...

951
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,932
and that the body wouldn't be
discovered till the next day.

952
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,059
Well, after all, it was
the middle of the night.

953
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,645
I'll bet he'd figured nobody would
find the body till the next day.

954
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,730
Pardon. This is my whole point.

955
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:29,526
The woman across the street testified
that the moment after she saw the killing -

956
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,195
that is, a moment after
the train went by...

957
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,281
she screamed and then went
to telephone the police.

958
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:38,743
Now, the boy certainly must
have heard the scream...

959
00:50:38,828 --> 00:50:42,330
so he knew that somebody saw something.

960
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:45,208
I just don't think that
he would have gone back.

961
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,044
Two things. One, in his state of
panic, he may not have heard the scream.

962
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,796
Perhaps it wasn't very loud.

963
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,258
Two, if he did hear it, he may not
have connected it with his own act.

964
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:56,386
Remember, he lived in a neighborhood
where screams were fairly commonplace.

965
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:58,930
- There's your answer.
- Maybe.

966
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,891
Maybe the boy did kill his
father, didn't hear the scream...

967
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:05,687
did run out in a panic, did
calm down three hours later...

968
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,398
and come back to get the knife,
risking being caught by the police.

969
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,401
Maybe all of those things
happened, but maybe they didn't.

970
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,237
I think there's enough doubt that we
can wonder whether he was there at all...

971
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,989
during the time the killing took place.

972
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,824
What do you mean doubt?
What are you talking about?

973
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,617
Didn't the old man see him
running out of the house?

974
00:51:19,702 --> 00:51:21,494
He's twisting the
facts, I'm telling you.

975
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:24,914
Did or didn't the old man see the
kid running out of the house at 12:10?

976
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,916
Well, did or didn't he?

977
00:51:27,001 --> 00:51:30,211
- He says he did.
- "Says he did"? Boy! How do you like that?

978
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:33,256
- Now, look, witnesses can make mistakes.
- Sure, when you want them to, they do.

979
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,592
Or when he wants them to,
they do. You know what I mean?

980
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,510
- Keep the yelling down!
- Oh, you keep saying that.

981
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:39,304
Maybe what we need is a
little yelling in here.

982
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:41,097
These guys keep going
off every which way.

983
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:43,099
Did hear the scream.
Didn't hear the scream.

984
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:46,352
What difference does it make? You people
are talking only about the little details.

985
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,938
You're forgetting the important stuff.
I mean, all of a sudden, everybody here -

986
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,399
- I want to call for another vote.
- I'm talking here!

987
00:51:51,484 --> 00:51:55,153
There's another vote called
for. Now let's take our seats.

988
00:51:59,033 --> 00:52:01,576
I never saw so much
time spent on nothing.

989
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,369
It only takes a second.

990
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:07,874
Okay. I guess the fastest way is
to find out who's voting not guilty.

991
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,710
Now, all those voting not
guilty, please raise your hands.

992
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:15,548
Still the same. One, two,
three not guilty. Nine guilty.

993
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:17,300
So, now where are we?

994
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,804
I'm telling you, we can yackety-yack until
next Tuesday. Where's it all getting us?

995
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:23,640
Pardon. I vote not guilty.

996
00:52:23,724 --> 00:52:26,726
Oh!

997
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:30,104
What are ya talking about? I mean, we're
all going crazy in here or something.

998
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:33,983
The kid is guilty. Why don't
you listen to the facts?

999
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:36,319
Tell him, will ya? Now this
is getting to be a joke.

1000
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,614
The vote is eight to
four, favor of guilty.

1001
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:43,368
What is this, love your underprivileged
brother week or something?

1002
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:45,954
I want you to get up and tell
me why you changed your vote.

1003
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:50,333
- Come on. Give me your reasons.
- I don't have to defend my decision to you.

1004
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,168
There is a reasonable doubt in my mind.

1005
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:55,255
What reasonable doubt? That's
nothing but words. Here, look at this.

1006
00:52:55,339 --> 00:53:00,260
The kid you just decided isn't guilty
was seen ramming this into his father.

1007
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,345
Now, what about this,
Mr. Reasonable Doubt?

1008
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,098
That's not the knife.
Don't you remember?

1009
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,350
Oh, brilliant.

1010
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,727
I'm telling ya, this is the craziest.

1011
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,980
I mean, what are we supposed to believe?

1012
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:14,899
I mean, you're sittin' here, you're
pulling stories out of thin air, you know?

1013
00:53:14,984 --> 00:53:18,695
A guy like this, if he's, uh, sitting
ringside at the Dempsey-Firpo fight...

1014
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:21,239
he'd be trying to tell you that, uh -

1015
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,700
Look. Now, what about the old man?

1016
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,369
Are we supposed to believe that he
didn't get up and run to his door...

1017
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,455
and see the kid tearing down the
steps 15 seconds after the killing?

1018
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,000
He's just saying so
to be important, right?

1019
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:34,878
- I mean, what's the point of the whole thing?
- Wait. Hold it a second, will you?

1020
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:37,171
Oh, and the Baltimore rooter
is heard from again now...

1021
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:39,215
and pop-ups are fallin' for
base hits wherever we look.

1022
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,552
Hold it a second. Now, look
- Did the old man say he ran to the door?

1023
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:45,597
Ran, walked. What's the difference? He got
on, didn't he? I mean, he got there, didn't he?

1024
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:48,224
- No, now wait a second.
- He said he ran. At least I think he did.

1025
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:51,728
Look, I don't remember what he said, but I
don't see how he could have run to the door.

1026
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:54,188
Î—e said he went from his
bedroom to the front door.

1027
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:55,899
- Now, isn't that enough?
- Where was the bedroom?

1028
00:53:55,983 --> 00:53:58,234
- It was down the hall somewhere.
- I thought you remembered everything.

1029
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,570
- Don't you remember that?
- No.

1030
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,864
Mr. Foreman, I'd like to see
a diagram of the apartment.

1031
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:06,200
- Why don't we just have 'em run the trial all over again so you can get everything straight?
- Mr. Foreman.

1032
00:54:06,285 --> 00:54:08,912
How come you're the only one in this
room wants to see exhibits all the time?

1033
00:54:08,996 --> 00:54:11,706
- I want to see this one too.
- And I'd like to stop wasting time.

1034
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,626
If we're gonna start wading through all that
nonsense about where the body was found -

1035
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,669
We're not, not unless
somebody else wants to.

1036
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:18,463
But I'd like to find
out if an old man...

1037
00:54:18,547 --> 00:54:20,924
who drags one foot when he walks
'cause he had a stroke last year...

1038
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,426
can get from his bedroom to
his front door in 15 seconds.

1039
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,178
- He said 20 seconds.
- Î—e said 15.

1040
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:27,430
He said 20 seconds. What
are you trying to distort -

1041
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,767
- He said 15.
- How does he know how long 15 seconds is?

1042
00:54:30,851 --> 00:54:32,518
You can't judge a thing like that.

1043
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,979
He said 15 seconds. He
was very positive about it.

1044
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:37,273
He was an old man. Half
the time he was confused.

1045
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:39,651
How could he be positive about anything?

1046
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:51,454
I don't see what you're going to prove here.
The man said he saw the boy running out.

1047
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,706
Well, let's see if the
details bear him out.

1048
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:56,668
As soon as the body hit the floor,
he said he heard footsteps upstairs...

1049
00:54:56,752 --> 00:54:58,419
running toward the front door...

1050
00:54:58,504 --> 00:55:01,589
heard the upstairs door open, the
footsteps start down the stairs.

1051
00:55:01,674 --> 00:55:03,800
He said he got to his own front
door as fast as he could...

1052
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,969
and he swore it couldn't have
been more than 15 seconds.

1053
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:07,720
Now, if the killer began
running immediately -

1054
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:10,014
- Maybe he didn't.
- The old man said he did.

1055
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:12,809
You ought to be at Atlantic City
at that hairsplitters convention.

1056
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,229
Hey, why don't you stop makin'
smart remarks all the time, huh?

1057
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,440
My friend, for your three dollars a day,
you have to listen to everything, you know?

1058
00:55:19,525 --> 00:55:21,234
Now that you've got that
thing in here, what about it?

1059
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,486
All right. Here's the apartment
where the killing took place.

1060
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,614
The old man's apartment was directly
beneath and exactly the same.

1061
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:29,909
Here are the el tracks, the bedroom,
living room, kitchen, bathroom.

1062
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:31,995
Here's the hall. Here are the stairs.

1063
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,330
Now, the old man was in
this bedroom right here.

1064
00:55:34,415 --> 00:55:37,083
He says he crossed to the door
and walked down the hall...

1065
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,128
opened the front door just in time to
see the boy running down the stairs.

1066
00:55:40,212 --> 00:55:43,548
- Am I right so far?
- That's the story, for the 19th time.

1067
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:47,176
- Fifteen seconds after the body hit the floor.
- Correct.

1068
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:49,303
Now, let's see. It was -

1069
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:53,391
It's 12 feet from the bed to
the door. The hall is 43 feet.

1070
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,686
He would have had to walk 12
feet, open the bedroom door...

1071
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,398
walk 43 feet down and open the
front door all in 15 seconds.

1072
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,192
- Do you think he could have done it?
- Sure he could have done it.

1073
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,862
He can walk only very slowly. They
had to help him into the witness chair.

1074
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:07,613
You make it sound like a long walk.

1075
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:10,033
For an old man who had a
stroke, it is a long walk.

1076
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:13,536
- Oh! What are you doing?
- I'm gonna try it, see how long it took him.

1077
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:16,998
What do you mean, you want to try it? Why didn't
his lawyer bring it up if it's so important?

1078
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:20,752
- Maybe he just didn't think about it, huh?
- What do you mean, didn't think of it? You think the man's an idiot or something?

1079
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,378
- It's an obvious thing.
- Did you think of it?

1080
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:24,130
Listen, smart guy. Don't
matter whether I thought of it.

1081
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,424
He didn't bring it up because he knew it
would hurt his case. What do you think of that?

1082
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:30,386
Maybe he didn't bring it up because it would have
meant bullying and badgering a helpless old man.

1083
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:33,806
You know that doesn't sit very well with
a jury. Most lawyers avoid it if they can.

1084
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:36,601
- So, what kind of a bum is he then?
- That's what I've been asking, buddy.

1085
00:56:36,685 --> 00:56:39,729
Pass me that chair, will you? Those
two chairs are the old man's bed.

1086
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,690
I just paced off 12 feet across the
room. This will be the bedroom door.

1087
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:45,401
Oh, that's crazy. You can't
recreate a thing like that.

1088
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,695
- I'd like to see it.
- The hall was 43 feet.

1089
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:49,781
I'll pace from that wall and back again.

1090
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:54,911
Look, this is absolutely insane. What are
you wasting everybody's time in here for?

1091
00:56:54,995 --> 00:56:57,872
According to you, it'll only take 15
seconds. Now, we can spare that, see.

1092
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,503
Come on. Knock it off.

1093
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,088
Okay.

1094
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,215
Okay. Okay, killer.

1095
00:57:07,299 --> 00:57:08,883
Yeah.

1096
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,262
Will you stand right there
and mark the front door?

1097
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,848
It was chain-locked according
to the testimony, remember?

1098
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,101
- Has anybody got a watch with a second hand?
- I have.

1099
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:20,603
When you want me to start, stamp your
foot. That'll be the body falling.

1100
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:22,605
You can time me from there.

1101
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,774
What are we gonna do, play charades now?

1102
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:26,901
- Come on! What are we waiting for?
- Okay, I'm ready.

1103
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,903
Well, I want to wait till
the second hand reaches 60.

1104
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,905
Oh, come on.

1105
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:40,623
Come on. Speed it up. He could
walk twice as fast as that.

1106
00:57:42,084 --> 00:57:44,544
You want me to walk
faster than that, I will.

1107
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,896
Lock. Door. Stop.

1108
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:05,982
- Right.
- What's the time?

1109
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:09,318
Uh, exactly 41 seconds.

1110
00:58:09,403 --> 00:58:11,654
This is what I think happened.

1111
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,574
The old man heard the fight between the
boy and his father a few hours earlier.

1112
00:58:14,658 --> 00:58:17,493
Then when he's lying in bed, he heard the
body hit the floor in the boy's apartment...

1113
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:21,080
heard the woman scream from across the street,
got to his front door as fast as he could...

1114
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:23,749
heard somebody racing down the
stairs and assumed it was the boy.

1115
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:25,668
- I think that's possible.
- Assumed?

1116
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:28,254
Oh.

1117
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:34,302
Brother, I've seen all kinds of dishonesty in
my day, but this little display takes the cake.

1118
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:39,098
You all come in here with your hearts bleeding
all over the floor about slum kids and injustice.

1119
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:41,184
You listen to some fairy tales.

1120
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,561
Suddenly you start getting through
to some of these old ladies.

1121
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,606
Well, you're not getting
through to me. I've had enough.

1122
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,733
What's the matter with you guys?

1123
00:58:48,817 --> 00:58:51,527
You all know he's
guilty! He's got to burn!

1124
00:58:51,612 --> 00:58:53,404
You're letting him slip
through our fingers.

1125
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,698
"Slip through our fingers"?
Are you his executioner?

1126
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,450
I'm one of 'em!

1127
00:58:58,619 --> 00:59:00,453
Perhaps you'd like to pull the switch.

1128
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,538
For this kid, you bet I would.

1129
00:59:02,623 --> 00:59:05,875
I feel sorry for you. What it must
feel like to want to pull the switch.

1130
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:10,671
Ever since you walked into this room, you've
been acting like a self-appointed public avenger.

1131
00:59:10,756 --> 00:59:15,051
You want to see this boy die because you
personally want it, not because of the facts.

1132
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,303
- You're a
sadist. - You -

1133
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:21,224
Let me go! I'll kill him. I'll kill him!

1134
00:59:21,308 --> 00:59:23,726
You don't really mean
you'll kill me, do you?

1135
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:33,361
Is there anything wrong,
gentlemen? I heard some noise.

1136
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:37,448
Oh, no. Everything's all right. We're just
- You know, friendly little argument. It's -

1137
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,826
Um, listen, we're through with that
diagram. You can take it if you want.

1138
00:59:42,204 --> 00:59:43,871
Here you are. Thank you.

1139
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,504
What are you lookin' at?

1140
01:00:12,276 --> 01:00:14,318
I suppose somebody has
to start it off again.

1141
01:00:14,403 --> 01:00:18,114
- I beg pardon.
- "I beg pardon. " What are you so polite about?

1142
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:20,283
For the same reason you're not.

1143
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,368
It's the way I was brought up.

1144
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:26,205
This fighting -

1145
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,332
That's not why we are here, to fight.

1146
01:00:28,417 --> 01:00:30,793
We have a responsibility.

1147
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:36,549
This, I have always thought, is a
remarkable thing about democracy...

1148
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,509
that we are -

1149
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,305
Uh, what is the word?

1150
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:45,474
Notified. That we are
notified by mail...

1151
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:49,895
to come down to this place to
decide on the guilt or innocence...

1152
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:54,025
of a man we have never heard of before.

1153
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:58,654
We have nothing to gain or lose by
- by our verdict.

1154
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:02,700
This is one of the
reasons why we are strong.

1155
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:06,829
We should not make it a personal thing.

1156
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:09,832
Thank you.

1157
01:01:11,043 --> 01:01:13,336
If nobody else has an idea,
I may have a cutie here.

1158
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,172
I mean, I haven't given it much thought,
but let's throw it out on the stoop...

1159
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:17,882
and see if the cat licks it up.

1160
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:20,301
- The cat licks it up?
- Yeah. If the boy -

1161
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:26,932
Look how dark it's getting out there.

1162
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:29,477
I'll bet we're gonna have a storm now.

1163
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:33,731
Boy, oh, boy. It's really hot, huh?

1164
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:38,027
Pardon me, but don't you ever sweat?

1165
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,614
No, I don't.

1166
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,699
Well, listen. I, uh -

1167
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:46,952
I was wondering if, uh, maybe -

1168
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,330
maybe we should take another vote.

1169
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:53,709
Oh, great. Maybe we can follow this one up
with a little dancing and refreshments, huh?

1170
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:55,586
- Hmm.
- Mr. Foreman?

1171
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,924
Well, that's okay with me.
Anyone doesn't want to vote?

1172
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:03,219
- Hey, come on. Come on.
- I'm sorry.

1173
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:06,806
I think we ought to have an open ballot
- call out our votes, you know.

1174
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:09,100
Let's see who stands where.

1175
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:11,685
That sounds fair to me. Anyone object?

1176
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:17,149
Okay. I'll call off
your jury numbers. One.

1177
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,945
Oh, that's me. I vote guilty.

1178
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:22,822
Two?

1179
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:24,407
Not guilty.

1180
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:27,785
- Number three?
- Guilty.

1181
01:02:28,787 --> 01:02:30,329
Number four?

1182
01:02:31,832 --> 01:02:33,624
Guilty.

1183
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,460
- Number five?
- Not guilty.

1184
01:02:37,546 --> 01:02:40,840
- Number six?
- Not guilty.

1185
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:43,509
Number seven?

1186
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,302
Guilty.

1187
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:47,430
Number eight?

1188
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,181
Not guilty.

1189
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:53,436
- Number nine?
- Not guilty.

1190
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,688
- Number 10?
- Guilty.

1191
01:02:57,482 --> 01:02:59,525
Number 11?

1192
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,444
Not guilty.

1193
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:03,028
Number 12?

1194
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:06,282
Number 12.

1195
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:07,867
Guilty.

1196
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,875
The vote is now six to six.

1197
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:19,128
Yeah, right. And we go into
extra innings here, huh?

1198
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:26,051
Six to six. I'm telling you, some of you
people in here must be out of your minds.

1199
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,970
A kid like that.

1200
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:31,307
I don't think the kind of boy
he is has anything to do with it.

1201
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:33,476
The facts are supposed
to determine the case.

1202
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,728
Don't give me that! I'm
sick and tired of facts!

1203
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,813
You can twist them any way
you like. You know what I mean?

1204
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:40,483
That's exactly the point this
gentleman has been making.

1205
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:43,486
- Oh!
- I mean, you keep shouting at the top of your lungs.

1206
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,072
I'd like to be a few years younger.

1207
01:03:47,157 --> 01:03:49,074
That man gets on my -

1208
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:55,289
- My, it's hot in here, isn't it?
- Do you want a drink of water?

1209
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:59,084
No. No, thanks. Thanks.

1210
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:08,719
It's gonna rain.

1211
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:11,055
Well, how'd you figure that out, killer?

1212
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,183
How come you changed your vote?

1213
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:16,685
Well, it just seemed to me
there was room for doubt.

1214
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,979
You haven't got a leg to stand
on. You know that, I hope.

1215
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:22,066
I don't feel that way. There were a
lot of details that never came out.

1216
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:25,694
- Yeah. Well, good luck.
- Oh, come on. You're like everybody else.

1217
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:27,988
You think too much. You get mixed up.

1218
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:33,202
- You know what I mean? - Now, listen.
I don't think you have any right -

1219
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:35,871
Loudmouth.

1220
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:31,093
Look at that come down, will you?

1221
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:34,138
You know...

1222
01:05:34,222 --> 01:05:36,724
this reminds me of
a storm we had last -

1223
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:40,269
Oh, when was that? November -

1224
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:43,439
I don't know. Something. It
was quite a storm we had there.

1225
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,899
It was right in the middle of a game.

1226
01:05:45,984 --> 01:05:48,611
Uh, we were behind 7-6...

1227
01:05:48,695 --> 01:05:51,280
but we just started to move
the ball, right off the tackle.

1228
01:05:51,364 --> 01:05:54,158
Started cutting right
- slash here and slash right in...

1229
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:56,035
cut right through.

1230
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,621
And, uh -

1231
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,914
We had this kid Slattery, you know?

1232
01:06:02,083 --> 01:06:05,461
A real
- He was an ox. You know, a real ox.

1233
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,047
I wish I had another one just like him.

1234
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:12,635
I forgot to tell you. I'm the assistant head
coach at the Andrew J. McCorkle High School.

1235
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,803
- Oh, yeah?
- That's out in Queens.

1236
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:17,640
And, uh, anyway...

1237
01:06:17,724 --> 01:06:19,808
we're starting to move along real nice.

1238
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:23,062
Their whole line is just
- they're just coming apart.

1239
01:06:24,356 --> 01:06:28,108
And it starts to come down
cats and dogs, just like this.

1240
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:30,819
Just whoosh
- you know, right down.

1241
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:35,491
Well, that was murder, you know?

1242
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:38,160
I swear, I
- I nearly bawled.

1243
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,579
You just
- You couldn't go nowhere.

1244
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,165
Well.

1245
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:01,308
Hey, what is it with
this fan here? How come -

1246
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:10,818
Hey! Î—uh?

1247
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:14,196
Must have been on the same
switch with the lights.

1248
01:07:15,198 --> 01:07:18,367
Well, things are looking up here, huh?

1249
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:20,536
Yeah, huh?

1250
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,376
Boy. That's better.

1251
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,551
Hey!

1252
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,302
Two points.

1253
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,308
Any of you guys ever go to the Garden?

1254
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:48,480
That's a damn stupid thing to do.

1255
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,733
Oh, I'm sorry. I, uh -

1256
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,152
You know?

1257
01:07:54,863 --> 01:07:56,363
Pardon me.

1258
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,783
Well, how do you like it? Even Steven.

1259
01:07:59,868 --> 01:08:02,244
Pretty surprising, isn't it?

1260
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,829
Yes.

1261
01:08:05,623 --> 01:08:09,126
Say, that business before, when
that tall guy - what's-his-name -

1262
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,920
was trying to bait me
- That doesn't prove anything.

1263
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:14,590
I'm a pretty excitable person.

1264
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:18,510
I mean, where does he come off calling me
a public avenger, sadist and everything?

1265
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:22,097
Anyone in his right mind
would blow his stack, huh?

1266
01:08:22,182 --> 01:08:24,475
He was just trying to bait me.

1267
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,560
He did an excellent job.

1268
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:31,565
I'll tell you what I think.
We're going nowhere here.

1269
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,193
I'm ready to walk into court
right now and declare a hung jury.

1270
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,111
There's no point in this
thing going on anymore.

1271
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:37,529
Yeah. I go for that too.

1272
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:40,449
Listen, let's take it in to the judge and let
the kid take his chances with 12 other guys.

1273
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,368
I don't think the judge will accept a hung
jury. We haven't been in here very long.

1274
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:45,120
Well, let's find out.

1275
01:08:45,205 --> 01:08:46,914
I'm not in favor of that.

1276
01:08:46,998 --> 01:08:50,209
Listen. This kid wouldn't stand a chance
with another jury, and you know it.

1277
01:08:50,293 --> 01:08:53,128
Come on! We're hung. Nobody's gonna
change his vote. Let's take it inside.

1278
01:08:53,213 --> 01:08:55,422
You still don't think there's
room for reasonable doubt?

1279
01:08:55,507 --> 01:08:56,799
No, I don't.

1280
01:08:56,883 --> 01:08:58,175
Pardon.

1281
01:08:58,259 --> 01:09:01,512
Maybe you don't fully understand
the term "reasonable doubt. "

1282
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:04,139
What do you mean I don't understand?

1283
01:09:05,225 --> 01:09:07,184
Boy, how do ya like this guy?

1284
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,936
I'm tellin' ya, they're all alike.

1285
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:11,855
They come over here, running for their life,
and before they can take a deep breath...

1286
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:14,316
they're telling us how
to run the show, huh?

1287
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,193
Boy, the arrogance of this guy.

1288
01:09:16,277 --> 01:09:20,864
Hey, all right. Let's stop the
arguing for about two minutes in here.

1289
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:23,325
Now, who's got something
constructive to say?

1290
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,954
I'd like to go over something,
if you gentlemen don't mind.

1291
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:29,706
An important point for the
prosecution was the fact...

1292
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:32,543
that after the boy claimed
he'd been at the movies...

1293
01:09:32,627 --> 01:09:34,628
during the hours that
the killing took place...

1294
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:38,590
couldn't remember the names of the
movies or the stars who appeared in them.

1295
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,176
This gentleman here has put up
that point in here several times.

1296
01:09:41,261 --> 01:09:42,719
That's correct.

1297
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,680
It was the only alibi the boy offered...

1298
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:47,266
and he himself couldn't back
it up with any details at all.

1299
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:50,602
Putting yourself in the boy's place, do
you think you could remember details...

1300
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:54,147
after an upsetting experience such as
being slapped in the face by your father?

1301
01:09:54,232 --> 01:09:57,442
I think so, if there were any
special details to remember.

1302
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:00,696
The boy couldn't remember the names of the
movies he saw because be wasn't there that night.

1303
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:02,823
According to the police
testimony in court...

1304
01:10:02,907 --> 01:10:06,034
the boy was questioned by the detectives
in the kitchen of his apartment...

1305
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:09,037
while the body of his father was
lying on the floor in the bedroom.

1306
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,707
Do you think you could remember
details under those circumstances?

1307
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,792
- I do.
- Under great emotional stress?

1308
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,378
- Under great emotional stress.
- He remembered them correctly in court.

1309
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,422
He named the pictures and
the stars who played in them.

1310
01:10:18,506 --> 01:10:21,675
Yes. His lawyer took great
pains to bring that out.

1311
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:24,303
He had three months from the night of
the murder to the day of the trial...

1312
01:10:24,387 --> 01:10:26,013
in which to memorize them.

1313
01:10:26,097 --> 01:10:28,765
It's not difficult for a lawyer to find
out what played at a particular theater...

1314
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:30,517
on a particular night.

1315
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:34,229
I'll take the testimony of the policemen who
interrogated the boy right after the murder...

1316
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:36,732
when he couldn't remember
a thing about the movies...

1317
01:10:36,816 --> 01:10:38,734
great emotional stress or not.

1318
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:42,112
- I'd like to ask you a personal question.
- Go ahead.

1319
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:45,449
- Where were you last night?
- I was home.

1320
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:48,076
- How about the night before that?
- Come on! What is this?

1321
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:49,494
No, it's all right.

1322
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:52,122
I left the office at 8:30 and
went straight home and to bed.

1323
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,874
And the night before that?

1324
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,376
That was, uh, Tuesday night?

1325
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,462
The night of the bridge
tournament. I played bridge.

1326
01:10:58,546 --> 01:10:59,880
Monday night?

1327
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:03,175
When you get down to New Year's
Eve, 1954, let me know, huh?

1328
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,137
Monday night?

1329
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:11,391
Monday night, uh, my wife
and I went to the movies.

1330
01:11:11,476 --> 01:11:13,101
- What did you see?
- The Scarlet Circle.

1331
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:16,438
- It was a clever whodunit.
- What was the second feature?

1332
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:19,149
The, um -

1333
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:21,902
I'll tell you in a minute. The, uh -

1334
01:11:21,986 --> 01:11:26,156
Remarkable Mrs., uh, something -

1335
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,700
The -

1336
01:11:28,785 --> 01:11:31,453
Mrs. Bainbridge. The
Remarkable Mrs. Bainbridge.

1337
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:34,289
I saw that. It's called
The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge.

1338
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:37,960
Uh,yes. The Amazing Mrs.
Bainbridge. I think that's right.

1339
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,545
Who was in The Amazing Mrs. Bainbridge?

1340
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:44,299
Barbara... Long, I think it was.

1341
01:11:44,384 --> 01:11:46,385
A dark, very pretty girl.

1342
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:50,222
Ling or Long
- something like that.

1343
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:53,517
- Who else?
- I'd never heard of them before.

1344
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:58,021
It was a very inexpensive second
feature with, uh, unknown -

1345
01:11:58,106 --> 01:12:01,233
And you weren't under an
emotional stress, were you?

1346
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,279
No.

1347
01:12:06,364 --> 01:12:08,031
I wasn't.

1348
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,660
I think the point is made.

1349
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:14,496
Big point!

1350
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,748
You can talk till your tongue
is draggin' on the floor.

1351
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:20,919
The boy is guilty, period. You
know what I mean, my friend?

1352
01:12:21,004 --> 01:12:24,256
- Who's got those cough drops?
- They're all gone, my friend.

1353
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:28,510
Oh, boy. Look at that rain.

1354
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:30,971
There goes your ball game.

1355
01:12:31,055 --> 01:12:33,473
It's only a shower.

1356
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,726
Besides, they got the infield covered.

1357
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:38,979
Right. Say, could I see
that knife a second, please?

1358
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:44,109
Well, we're still tied up six to six.

1359
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,194
Who's got a suggestion?

1360
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:48,280
It's five after 6:00.
Let's get some dinner.

1361
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,824
Why don't we wait till 7:00,
give it another hour, huh?

1362
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:53,035
Okay with me.

1363
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:55,287
Uh, there's something I'd like to say.

1364
01:12:55,371 --> 01:12:58,915
I mean, it's been bothering me a
little, and as long as we're stuck.

1365
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:02,878
Well, there was this whole business
about the stab wound and how it was made -

1366
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,588
the downward angle of it, you know?

1367
01:13:04,672 --> 01:13:06,673
Don't tell me we're gonna
start with that again.

1368
01:13:06,758 --> 01:13:08,383
They've been over it and over it.

1369
01:13:08,468 --> 01:13:10,761
Well, I know they did, but
I don't go along with it.

1370
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:14,848
Now, the boy was 5 feet 7
inches tall. His father was 6'2".

1371
01:13:14,932 --> 01:13:17,100
That's a difference of seven inches.

1372
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:19,853
It's a very awkward thing to stab
down into the chest of someone...

1373
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:21,938
who's more than half a
foot taller than you are.

1374
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,149
Give me that.

1375
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:27,027
I'll give you a
demonstration. Somebody get up.

1376
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,322
You -

1377
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:37,537
I want you to watch this 'cause I
don't want to have to do it again.

1378
01:13:37,622 --> 01:13:40,373
I'll make myself about six
or seven inches shorter, okay?

1379
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,585
- It's about right. Maybe a little more.
- Okay. A little more.

1380
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,804
That's not funny.

1381
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:59,726
Now, nobody's hurt. Right?

1382
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:02,187
Right. Nobody hurt.

1383
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:10,445
Now, this is the way I'd stab
a man who was taller than I was.

1384
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,989
Look at the angle
- down and in.

1385
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:15,158
And this is the way it was done.

1386
01:14:15,243 --> 01:14:17,410
Now tell me I'm wrong.

1387
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:23,041
- Down and in. I guess there's no argument.
- Hold it a minute, will ya?

1388
01:14:23,126 --> 01:14:24,960
Can you give me that?

1389
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,879
Boy, I hate these things.

1390
01:14:27,964 --> 01:14:29,631
- Did you ever see a knife fight?
- No.

1391
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,299
- You?
- No.

1392
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:34,177
Anybody here ever see a knife fight?

1393
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:37,055
Well, I have. You know,
on my back stoop...

1394
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,474
the lot across the street, backyard.

1395
01:14:39,559 --> 01:14:41,977
Switchblades came with the
neighborhood where I lived.

1396
01:14:42,061 --> 01:14:45,313
It's funny I never thought of it before.
I guess you try to forget those things.

1397
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:48,775
- How do you use a switchblade?
- Well, you'd never use it like this.

1398
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:52,821
See, you use too much
time switching hands.

1399
01:14:54,574 --> 01:14:57,075
Here's how
- underhanded.

1400
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:02,831
Anyone who's ever used a switch knife
wouldn't handle it any other way.

1401
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:05,542
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

1402
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:07,460
That's why they're
made to open like that.

1403
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:10,172
- You'd say the boy was pretty
handy with a knife? - Mm-hmm.

1404
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:13,425
You think he could have made the
kind of wound that killed his father?

1405
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:17,429
No. Not with the experience he'd had
all his life handling these things.

1406
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:19,514
I feel he'd have gone
for him underhanded.

1407
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:22,642
How do you know? Were you in the
room when the father was killed?

1408
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,728
No. Neither was anybody else.

1409
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:28,023
So what are you giving us all this
mumbo jumbo for? I don't believe it.

1410
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:31,359
I don't think you can determine what type of
wound the boy might or might not have made...

1411
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:34,070
simply because he knew
how to handle a knife.

1412
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:36,489
What do you think?

1413
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:38,658
- I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know?

1414
01:15:38,743 --> 01:15:40,577
I don't know.

1415
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:46,791
How about you?

1416
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:50,629
I don't know about the rest of them, but I'm getting
a little tired of this yackety-yackin' back and forth.

1417
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:54,174
It's gettin' us nowhere. So I
guess I'll have to break it up.

1418
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,801
I change my vote to not guilty.

1419
01:15:56,886 --> 01:16:00,222
- You what?
- You heard me. I've had enough.

1420
01:16:00,306 --> 01:16:02,766
What do you mean you've had
enough? That's no answer!

1421
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:06,811
Hey, listen. You just take
care of yourself, huh? You know?

1422
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:10,857
He's right. That's not an answer.

1423
01:16:10,942 --> 01:16:13,902
What kind of a man are you?

1424
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:17,113
You have sat here and voted
guilty with everyone else...

1425
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:21,451
because there are some baseball
tickets burning a hole in your pocket.

1426
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:25,789
And now you've changed your vote because
you say you're sick of all the talking here?

1427
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:28,250
Now listen, buddy!

1428
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:33,004
Who tells you that you have the right
to play like this with a man's life?

1429
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:35,590
- Don't you care -
- Now wait a minute!

1430
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:39,678
- You can't talk like that to me!
- I can talk like that to you.

1431
01:16:39,762 --> 01:16:41,638
If you want to vote not guilty...

1432
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:44,099
then do it because you are
convinced the man is not guilty...

1433
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:45,976
not because you've had enough.

1434
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,645
And if you think he is
guilty, then vote that way.

1435
01:16:48,729 --> 01:16:51,940
Or don't you have the guts
to do what you think is right?

1436
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:54,276
- Now listen.
- Guilty or not guilty?

1437
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:58,655
- I told you, not guilty.
- Why?

1438
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:01,950
Look, I don't have to -

1439
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,161
You do have to! Say it! Why?

1440
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:07,706
All right. I don't,
uh, think he's guilty.

1441
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:18,842
I want another vote.

1442
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:21,428
Okay. There's another vote called for.

1443
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:24,389
I guess the quickest way is a
show of hands. Anyone object?

1444
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:27,392
Okay. All those voting not
guilty, raise your hands.

1445
01:17:28,311 --> 01:17:33,481
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

1446
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:37,986
eight.

1447
01:17:41,907 --> 01:17:44,034
Um, nine.

1448
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:50,040
Um, all those voting
guilty, raise your hands.

1449
01:17:50,124 --> 01:17:52,500
One, two, three.

1450
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:55,086
Well, the vote's nine to
three in favor of acquittal.

1451
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:58,256
I don't understand you people!

1452
01:17:58,341 --> 01:18:00,508
I mean, all these picky little
points you keep bringing up.

1453
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:03,928
They don't mean nothing! You
saw this kid just like I did.

1454
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:07,515
You're not gonna tell me you believe
that phony story about losing the knife...

1455
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,601
and that business about
being at the movies.

1456
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,687
Look, you know how these
people lie. It's born in them.

1457
01:18:12,772 --> 01:18:14,814
I mean, what the heck.
I don't have to tell you.

1458
01:18:14,899 --> 01:18:16,858
They don't know what the truth is.

1459
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:20,653
And let me tell you, they don't need any
real big reason to kill someone either.

1460
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,489
No, sir.

1461
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:25,617
They get drunk! Oh, they're
real big drinkers, all of 'em.

1462
01:18:25,701 --> 01:18:28,870
You know that. And bang
- someone's lying in the gutter.

1463
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:31,956
Well, nobody's blaming them for it.
That's the way they are, by nature.

1464
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,125
You know what I mean? Violent!

1465
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:35,710
Where are you going?

1466
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:38,797
Î—uman life don't mean as
much to them as it does to us.

1467
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:42,801
Look! They're lushing it up
and fighting all the time...

1468
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:44,886
and if somebody gets killed,
so somebody gets killed!

1469
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,346
They don't care!

1470
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,640
Oh, sure, there's some
good things about 'em too.

1471
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,683
Look, I'm the first one to say that.

1472
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:54,062
I've known a couple who were okay, but
that's the exception, you know what I mean?

1473
01:18:54,146 --> 01:18:57,899
Most of 'em, it's like they have
no feelings. They can do anything.

1474
01:18:57,983 --> 01:19:00,568
What's going on here?

1475
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:02,695
I'm
- I'm trying to tell ya...

1476
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,781
you're making a big mistake, you people.

1477
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:07,867
This kid is a liar! I know
it. I know all about them.

1478
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,746
Listen to me. They're no good.

1479
01:19:11,831 --> 01:19:14,165
There's not a one of 'em who's any good.

1480
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:18,670
I mean, what
- What's happening in here?

1481
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:21,005
I'm speaking my piece, and you -

1482
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:23,883
Listen to me.

1483
01:19:24,969 --> 01:19:26,428
I -

1484
01:19:26,512 --> 01:19:28,972
We're - This kid on
trial here, his type -

1485
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:31,057
Well, don't you know about them?

1486
01:19:33,018 --> 01:19:36,479
Th-There's - There's
a danger here.

1487
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:38,648
These people are dangerous.

1488
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:41,776
They're... wild.

1489
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:43,778
Listen to me.

1490
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,197
- Listen.
- I have.

1491
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:49,284
Now sit down and don't
open your mouth again.

1492
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:55,957
I was only trying to... tell you.

1493
01:20:32,453 --> 01:20:36,748
It's always difficult to keep personal
prejudice out of a thing like this.

1494
01:20:37,875 --> 01:20:41,878
Wherever you run into it,
prejudice always obscures the truth.

1495
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:45,840
I don't really know what the truth is.

1496
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:48,843
I don't suppose anybody
will ever really know.

1497
01:20:50,137 --> 01:20:54,098
Nine of us now seem to feel
that the defendant is innocent.

1498
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:57,185
But we're just gambling
on probabilities.

1499
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,229
We may be wrong.

1500
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:01,689
We may be trying to let
a guilty man go free.

1501
01:21:01,774 --> 01:21:03,233
I don't know.

1502
01:21:03,317 --> 01:21:05,318
Nobody really can.

1503
01:21:05,402 --> 01:21:07,779
But we have a reasonable doubt...

1504
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:11,366
and that's something that's
very valuable in our system.

1505
01:21:11,450 --> 01:21:15,995
No jury can declare a man
guilty unless it's sure.

1506
01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:19,832
We nine can't understand...

1507
01:21:19,917 --> 01:21:22,627
how you three are still so sure.

1508
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:25,463
- Maybe you can tell us.
- I'll try.

1509
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,343
You've made some excellent points, but I
still believe the boy is guilty of murder...

1510
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:32,136
and I have two reasons.

1511
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:35,348
One, the evidence given by
the woman across the street...

1512
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:38,059
who actually saw the murder committed.

1513
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,728
As far as I'm concerned, that's
the most important testimony.

1514
01:21:40,813 --> 01:21:44,065
And two, the fact that she
described the stabbing by saying...

1515
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:49,779
she saw the boy raise his arm over his
head and stab down into the father's chest.

1516
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:51,906
She saw him do it the wrong way.

1517
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:53,908
That's absolutely right.

1518
01:21:53,993 --> 01:21:56,578
Let's talk about this
woman for a moment.

1519
01:21:56,662 --> 01:21:59,747
She said she went to bed
about 11:00 that night.

1520
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:03,418
Her bed was next to the window, and
she could look out while lying down...

1521
01:22:03,502 --> 01:22:07,589
and see directly into the
boy's room across the street.

1522
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:10,300
She tossed and turned for
over an hour, unable to sleep.

1523
01:22:10,384 --> 01:22:14,554
Finally, she turned toward the window
at about 10 minutes after 12:00...

1524
01:22:14,638 --> 01:22:19,767
and, as she looked out, she saw the killing
through the windows of a passing el train.

1525
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:22,562
She said the lights went out
immediately after the killing...

1526
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:27,442
but that she got a good look at the
boy in the act of stabbing his father.

1527
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:32,280
As far as I can see it,
this is unshakable testimony.

1528
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,700
- Well, that's the whole case.
- What do you think?

1529
01:22:41,081 --> 01:22:42,749
How about you?

1530
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,836
I
- I don't know.

1531
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,921
So much evidence to sift.

1532
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:50,965
This is a pretty complicated business.

1533
01:22:51,050 --> 01:22:54,844
Frankly, I don't see how
you can vote for acquittal.

1534
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:57,263
It's not so easy to arrange
all the evidence in order.

1535
01:22:57,348 --> 01:22:59,390
You can throw out all
the other evidence!

1536
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:03,061
The woman saw him do it!
What else do you want?

1537
01:23:03,145 --> 01:23:05,021
- Yeah, well, maybe
- - Let's vote on it.

1538
01:23:05,105 --> 01:23:07,273
Okay. There's another vote called for.

1539
01:23:07,358 --> 01:23:09,192
Anybody object?

1540
01:23:09,276 --> 01:23:12,320
All right. I'm changing
my vote. He's guilty.

1541
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,822
Anybody else? The vote is eight to four.

1542
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:18,493
Why is this such a personal triumph for you
- this one vote?

1543
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:22,038
Okay. I say we're a hung jury.
I say we take it in to the judge.

1544
01:23:22,122 --> 01:23:24,832
Î—ow about it? I want to hear arguments.

1545
01:23:24,917 --> 01:23:27,418
You, you're the leader of
the cause. What about it?

1546
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:31,506
Let's go over it again.

1547
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:33,508
We've been over it again!

1548
01:23:33,592 --> 01:23:38,388
The boy in the gray flannel suit here is bouncin'
backwards and forwards like a tennis ball.

1549
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:42,308
No point in getting nasty and
trying to turn this into a contest.

1550
01:23:44,269 --> 01:23:45,728
Okay.

1551
01:23:45,813 --> 01:23:48,856
Maybe we can talk about
setting some kind of time limit.

1552
01:23:48,941 --> 01:23:51,067
Yeah, once around for the deal, huh?

1553
01:23:51,777 --> 01:23:55,530
It's a quarter after 6:00.

1554
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:57,573
Someone before mentioned 7:00.

1555
01:23:57,658 --> 01:24:00,034
I think that's a point at which
we might begin to discuss...

1556
01:24:00,119 --> 01:24:03,371
the question of whether
we're a hung jury or not.

1557
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,123
Don't you feel well?

1558
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,418
I feel perfectly well, thank you.

1559
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:11,212
I was saying that 7:00
would be a reasonable time.

1560
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:14,215
Uh, the reason I asked
about that was because, uh...

1561
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:15,883
you were rubbing your nose like -

1562
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:18,636
Oh, I'm sorry for interrupting...

1563
01:24:18,721 --> 01:24:21,931
but you made a gesture that
reminded me of something.

1564
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:24,058
I'm trying to settle
something here. Do you mind?

1565
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:26,144
Well, I think this is important.

1566
01:24:27,229 --> 01:24:29,021
Thank you.

1567
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:31,733
Now then, I'm sure you'll
pardon me for this...

1568
01:24:31,817 --> 01:24:34,736
but I was wondering why you
were rubbing your nose like that.

1569
01:24:34,820 --> 01:24:36,487
Oh, come on, will ya?

1570
01:24:36,572 --> 01:24:40,742
At this point, I happen to be talking
to the gentleman sitting next to you!

1571
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:44,078
Now, why were you rubbing
your nose like that?

1572
01:24:44,163 --> 01:24:48,249
Well, if it's any of your business, I was
rubbing it because it bothers me a little.

1573
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:49,959
Oh. I'm sorry.

1574
01:24:50,043 --> 01:24:53,921
- Is it - Is it because of
your eyeglasses? - It is.

1575
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:55,757
Now can we get on to something else?

1576
01:24:55,841 --> 01:25:00,428
Your eyeglasses made those two deep
impressions on the sides of your nose.

1577
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,680
I hadn't noticed that before.

1578
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:06,267
- That must be annoying.
- It is very annoying.

1579
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,269
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

1580
01:25:08,353 --> 01:25:11,689
I've never worn
eyeglasses. Twenty-twenty.

1581
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:14,317
Listen, will you come on
already with the optometrist bit?

1582
01:25:16,236 --> 01:25:19,781
The woman who testified
that she saw the killing...

1583
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:23,409
had those same marks on
the sides of her nose.

1584
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:26,621
Holy smokes! You know, he's right.

1585
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:28,372
Please.

1586
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:32,210
Just give me a minute,
and I'll be finished.

1587
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:35,129
I don't know if anyone
else noticed that about her.

1588
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:39,091
I didn't think of it then, but
I've been going over her face...

1589
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:42,261
in my mind.

1590
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:44,347
She had those same marks.

1591
01:25:45,349 --> 01:25:49,519
- She kept rubbing them in court.
- He's right. She did do that a lot.

1592
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:55,233
This woman was about, uh
- about 45 years old.

1593
01:25:55,317 --> 01:25:59,278
She was making a tremendous
effort to look 35...

1594
01:25:59,363 --> 01:26:01,572
for her first public appearance.

1595
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:04,909
Heavy makeup, dyed hair...

1596
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:08,871
brand-new clothes that should
have been worn by a younger woman.

1597
01:26:08,956 --> 01:26:10,623
No glasses.

1598
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,375
No, women do that.

1599
01:26:12,459 --> 01:26:14,877
See if you can get the
mental picture of it.

1600
01:26:14,962 --> 01:26:16,796
What do you mean, no glasses?

1601
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,590
How do you know whether she wore glasses?
Just 'cause she was rubbing her nose?

1602
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:21,884
Now, she had those marks. I saw 'em.

1603
01:26:21,969 --> 01:26:23,886
So what? What do ya think that means?

1604
01:26:23,971 --> 01:26:27,181
- Listen, I'm getting so sick of your yelling in here!
- Come on. Forget it.

1605
01:26:27,266 --> 01:26:30,268
Hey, listen. Listen, he's
right. I saw them too.

1606
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:33,479
I was the closest one to her. She had these, uh
- these things on the side of her nose.

1607
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:36,774
- What do you call those on the side?
- Well, what point are you making here?

1608
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:40,736
She had dyed hair, marks on her
nose. Well, what does that mean?

1609
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:45,116
Could those marks be made by
anything other than eyeglasses?

1610
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:51,038
No, they couldn't.

1611
01:26:51,123 --> 01:26:53,124
I didn't see any marks!

1612
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:56,460
I did.

1613
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:59,088
Strange, but I didn't
think about it before.

1614
01:26:59,172 --> 01:27:01,299
Well, what about the lawyer?
Why didn't he say something?

1615
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:04,302
There are 12 people in here
concentrating on this case.

1616
01:27:04,386 --> 01:27:06,470
Eleven of us didn't think of it either.

1617
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:09,724
Well, what about the district attorney?
Do you think he'd pull a trick like that?

1618
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:11,684
Have her testify without her glasses?

1619
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:15,730
Did you ever see a woman who had to wear glasses and
didn't want to because she thinks they spoil her looks?

1620
01:27:15,814 --> 01:27:19,317
Okay. She had marks on her nose.

1621
01:27:19,401 --> 01:27:23,070
I'm giving you that.
From glasses, right?

1622
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:27,325
She didn't want to wear 'em out of the
house so people would think she's gorgeous.

1623
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:31,996
But when she saw this kid killing his
father, she was in the house alone.

1624
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,290
That's all.

1625
01:27:34,374 --> 01:27:38,377
- Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?
- No, I don't.

1626
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:42,006
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.

1627
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,092
It's logical to assume that she wasn't
wearing them when she was in bed...

1628
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:46,928
tossing and turning,
trying to fall asleep.

1629
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:49,347
- How do you know?
- I don't know! I'm guessing.

1630
01:27:49,431 --> 01:27:51,891
I'm also guessing that she probably
didn't put her glasses on...

1631
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:54,101
when she turned to look
casually out of the window.

1632
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:56,938
And she herself testified the killing
took place just as she looked out.

1633
01:27:57,022 --> 01:28:00,066
The lights went off a split second later. She
couldn't have had time to put them on then.

1634
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:01,776
- Wait a second.
- Here's another guess.

1635
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:05,947
Maybe she honestly thought she saw the boy
kill his father. I say she only saw a blur.

1636
01:28:06,031 --> 01:28:09,617
How do you know what she saw?
How does he know all that?

1637
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:12,453
How do you know what kind of glasses
she wore? Maybe they were sunglasses.

1638
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:15,164
Maybe she was farsighted.
What do you know about it?

1639
01:28:15,248 --> 01:28:18,501
I only know the woman's
eyesight is in question now.

1640
01:28:18,585 --> 01:28:24,715
She had to be able to identify a person
60 feet away, at night, without glasses.

1641
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,176
You can't send someone off
to die on evidence like that.

1642
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:29,261
Oh, don't give me that.

1643
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:31,514
Don't you think the woman
might have made a mistake?

1644
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:34,016
- No.
- It's not possible?

1645
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:35,726
No, it's not possible.

1646
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:40,606
Is it possible?

1647
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:43,401
Not guilty.

1648
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:50,241
Do you think he's guilty?

1649
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:52,326
I think he's guilty.

1650
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,747
Do you?

1651
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:02,670
No. I'm convinced.

1652
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:04,338
Not guilty.

1653
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:06,215
What's the matter with you?

1654
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:08,217
I have a reasonable doubt now.

1655
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:09,844
Eleven to one.

1656
01:29:09,928 --> 01:29:12,847
Well, what about all the other
evidence? What about all that stuff?

1657
01:29:12,931 --> 01:29:15,016
The knife, the whole business!

1658
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,019
Well, you said we could throw
out all the other evidence.

1659
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:25,943
Well, what do we do now?

1660
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:30,614
You're alone.

1661
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:34,535
I don't care whether I'm
alone or not! It's my right.

1662
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,874
It's your right.

1663
01:29:49,009 --> 01:29:51,427
Well, what do you
want? I say he's guilty.

1664
01:29:53,055 --> 01:29:56,390
- We want to hear your arguments.
- I gave you my arguments.

1665
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,518
We're not convinced.

1666
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:02,396
We want to hear them again.

1667
01:30:02,481 --> 01:30:04,482
We have as much time as it takes.

1668
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:14,617
Everything - Every single thing
that took place in that courtroom -

1669
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:16,619
but I mean everything
- says he's guilty.

1670
01:30:16,703 --> 01:30:19,163
What do you think, I'm
an idiot or something?

1671
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:22,917
Why don't you take that
stuff about the old man?

1672
01:30:23,001 --> 01:30:26,170
The old man who lived
there and heard everything.

1673
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:29,507
Or this business about the knife.

1674
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:31,592
What? 'Cause he found
another one exactly like it?

1675
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:35,012
The old man saw him
right there on the stairs!

1676
01:30:35,097 --> 01:30:37,932
What's the difference
how many seconds it was?

1677
01:30:39,101 --> 01:30:41,102
Every single thing.

1678
01:30:42,521 --> 01:30:45,689
The knife falling through
a hole in his pocket.

1679
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:49,110
You can't prove he
didn't get to the door.

1680
01:30:49,194 --> 01:30:51,612
Sure, you can take all the
time, hobble around the room.

1681
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:54,281
But you can't prove it!

1682
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:59,829
And what about this business
of the el and the movies?

1683
01:30:59,913 --> 01:31:02,957
There's a phony deal
if I ever heard one.

1684
01:31:03,041 --> 01:31:07,253
I'll bet ya $5,000 I'd
remember the movies I saw.

1685
01:31:07,337 --> 01:31:09,588
I'm telling ya, everything
that's gone on...

1686
01:31:09,673 --> 01:31:13,509
has been twisted and turned!

1687
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:15,678
This business with the glasses?

1688
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:21,308
How do you know she didn't have them
on? This woman testified in open court!

1689
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:25,354
And what about hearing
the kid yell, huh?

1690
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:28,691
I'm telling ya, I've
got all the facts here.

1691
01:31:29,860 --> 01:31:31,735
Here. Ah -

1692
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:36,615
Well, that's it! That's the whole case.

1693
01:31:43,832 --> 01:31:45,416
Well?

1694
01:31:47,711 --> 01:31:49,712
Say something!

1695
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:58,429
You lousy bunch of bleeding hearts.

1696
01:31:59,097 --> 01:32:01,015
You're not gonna intimidate me.

1697
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:03,601
I'm entitled to my opinion.

1698
01:32:06,980 --> 01:32:11,275
Rotten kids. You work your life out!

1699
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:18,073
I can't keep -

1700
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:24,413
No.

1701
01:32:28,293 --> 01:32:30,127
Not guilty.

1702
01:32:33,506 --> 01:32:35,174
Not guilty.

1703
01:32:38,178 --> 01:32:39,803
Not -

1704
01:32:50,357 --> 01:32:52,524
Um, we're ready now.

1705
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:47,848
Hey!

1706
01:34:52,187 --> 01:34:53,854
What's your name?

1707
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:55,439
Davis.

1708
01:34:55,523 --> 01:34:57,441
My name's McCardle.

1709
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:01,445
Well, so long.

1710
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:03,030
So long.
