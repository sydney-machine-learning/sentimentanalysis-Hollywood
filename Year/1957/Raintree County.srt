1
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:24,323
Look at the birdie---look at the tree

2
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:27,222
My girls are the prettiest
known to the county

3
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:28,686
That's all

4
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:31,787
Mr. Durin, you've made us all models

5
00:02:33,266 --> 00:02:35,496
Young ladies and gentlemen---

6
00:02:39,172 --> 00:02:43,632
Now, young ladies and gentlemen---
alright, you cloud-headed

7
00:02:43,677 --> 00:02:46,339
You've still 2 weeks before graduation

8
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,045
Let me remind you

9
00:02:48,114 --> 00:02:50,139
Mr. Durin's picture taking is completed

10
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:53,812
You prepare yourself to Mr. Durin here
some time this week

11
00:02:53,887 --> 00:02:55,354
an individual photograph

12
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:57,219
to appear in the Academy Album

13
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:03,887
Miss Kader---why are you standing there
as if transpiring?

14
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:08,094
ls it because you've left your books
in the study at the expense of

15
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:09,726
your splendid youth and innocence

16
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:12,863
or is it because you've already entered
into the miserable Harvard womanhood

17
00:03:12,939 --> 00:03:14,429
there bitter with them?

18
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:18,171
Alright, stop all of that
or stop blushing

19
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:37,789
Seanacy---

20
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:39,490
He's not here

21
00:03:42,536 --> 00:03:44,936
0h, you mustn't see me hiding

22
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:46,729
Hide what?

23
00:03:51,111 --> 00:03:53,375
Happy graduation, Seanacy

24
00:03:53,847 --> 00:03:55,314
Thank you

25
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,317
Happy graduation to you

26
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,721
Thank you

27
00:04:09,729 --> 00:04:11,822
l guess every thing, my dear

28
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:14,592
lsn't that nice?

29
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:17,067
We think the same thing

30
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,802
lsn't that crazy?

31
00:04:20,473 --> 00:04:22,839
0pen your present, Johnny

32
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,211
lt's all about Raintree County

33
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:36,845
lt's illustrated with colored maps---
statistics and history---

34
00:04:36,957 --> 00:04:38,822
and place adventures

35
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:42,361
lt's wonderful---just wonderful

36
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:48,299
Look---prominent citizens of
Raintree County

37
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:52,897
There're over hundred of them

38
00:04:53,306 --> 00:04:56,742
Johnny, someday your name will be
the first on that list

39
00:04:56,876 --> 00:04:58,309
Naturally

40
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:00,510
0pen yours, come on

41
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:13,782
Well, l think you'll like it---
it weighs 6 lbs

42
00:05:15,061 --> 00:05:24,493
0h, l think Baron the most magnificent
man ever lived

43
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:27,673
He seemed so much in need of

44
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:29,399
a good woman to love and love him

45
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:31,374
He never really found one

46
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:32,342
Yes---

47
00:05:32,412 --> 00:05:36,314
There's a photograph inside---
l wrote something on the back of it

48
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,654
Johnny, it's beautiful

49
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:49,527
You know what l think?

50
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:53,654
l think someday you're going to be
a great writer

51
00:05:54,134 --> 00:05:56,398
lt's just beautiful

52
00:06:14,754 --> 00:06:17,518
l've never heard such nonsense

53
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:20,785
wasting 3 days write this

54
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:22,120
What's this---a speech?

55
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:23,162
lt's not nonsense

56
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:25,823
lt's an honor to validate Victoria

57
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:29,335
lt goes to student first ranking
with scholarship

58
00:06:29,402 --> 00:06:30,334
You know so much about it

59
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:34,567
What did you ever valid---validate---
whatever it's called?

60
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:38,043
Pap validated Victoria for the whole
Raintree County

61
00:06:38,144 --> 00:06:39,008
Did you know that, Mom?

62
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,569
Your father?

63
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:45,345
Preach the sermon of the most
undesirable element

64
00:06:45,452 --> 00:06:51,687
Waste the elegance that carries
a lot of ground

65
00:06:51,858 --> 00:06:55,885
Undesirable element which we desire---

66
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:59,554
You object Pap elevating virtue welfare
to people?

67
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:01,993
What about my virtue welfare?

68
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:04,864
Why can't we get an inside pump?

69
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:06,903
Yeah, Pap---what about an inside pump?

70
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:08,769
That's not a joke

71
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:11,308
What you learn at that school?

72
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:13,470
You learn to have beer?

73
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,208
Your mother has pretty confused
with Heidelberg

74
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:17,681
You learn to smoke like tobacco?

75
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:18,615
Like a chimney

76
00:07:18,718 --> 00:07:24,054
Huh, your father likes that ever here
he's German on the evil to tobacco

77
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,524
and at the regular pond some do it chew
and some do it smoke

78
00:07:28,628 --> 00:07:31,290
But some end up there like still pole

79
00:07:31,698 --> 00:07:32,824
l do offer the same

80
00:07:32,966 --> 00:07:34,331
You know anything else?

81
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,531
Hm ---l learn my mother is a flaw and
what she said is hateful

82
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:42,766
by the way she said it

83
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:47,841
You never mount anything like---like that

84
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:49,608
Well, he ought to mount to something

85
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:52,947
He's related to one of the greatest
writers in the English language

86
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:54,111
Who's that?

87
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,188
Thomas Carlyle naturally

88
00:07:57,023 --> 00:07:58,422
l think you're old enough to know

89
00:07:58,491 --> 00:08:00,652
Joe, stop that foolishness

90
00:08:01,161 --> 00:08:03,186
Well, l always thought one day

91
00:08:03,263 --> 00:08:04,525
there'd be a great man in the family

92
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:05,859
Great man?

93
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:09,095
lf a great man is more than good
to find a job and farm this land

94
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:12,697
Why ever l curse with such a burden?

95
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:15,172
0h---which reminds me

96
00:08:15,275 --> 00:08:17,106
How are you and Nell getting along?

97
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:22,014
Nell is a fine girl and she is---

98
00:08:22,115 --> 00:08:24,413
Well, she's Raintree County

99
00:08:24,517 --> 00:08:28,146
That means a lot of people like us---
people with roots

100
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:30,518
A man should not only marry his beloved

101
00:08:30,623 --> 00:08:32,454
He should marry his region

102
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,687
A good wife is a good start---
taught greatness

103
00:08:37,797 --> 00:08:41,255
Pap, define greatness

104
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:43,267
Greatness?

105
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:48,064
Well, a great man is one
who does good for others and

106
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:51,969
that's the way your father qualified

107
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:53,006
Greatness?

108
00:08:53,112 --> 00:08:53,669
Ha---

109
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:56,374
lf that great philosopher Socrates
were living today---

110
00:08:56,449 --> 00:08:59,213
lf he were chosen sitting on that crack
chewing tobacco---

111
00:08:59,285 --> 00:09:01,412
that's America---that's greatness

112
00:09:01,654 --> 00:09:03,315
Do l shock you?

113
00:09:03,923 --> 00:09:07,290
How can l shock such unenlightened
ground heads?

114
00:09:08,928 --> 00:09:11,829
Are you stunned, Mrs. Lydia Gray?

115
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:15,967
0h, stop looking at me, child

116
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:20,495
That's big brown cow eyes on mules
like wax in the plate

117
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,539
Yeah

118
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:26,077
Do l shock you, Miss Nell Kader?

119
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:28,113
Not as much as you like to

120
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:30,206
0h, there must be someone l shook

121
00:09:31,184 --> 00:09:32,947
How about you, Johnny Seanacy?

122
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:34,610
l---relish it

123
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:37,053
You don't want to shock me
if you don't want shocking

124
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,657
Hm ---thanks, my boy

125
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,828
Now, about greatness---

126
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:47,696
We Americans measure greatness
in simple terms---in terms of money

127
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:50,166
We're always hunting with a tree of life

128
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,135
whose root is pure gold---

129
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:56,640
You have beautiful chest-like color
hair, my dear

130
00:09:57,644 --> 00:09:59,976
But, there's another tree---

131
00:10:00,113 --> 00:10:02,604
not of gold, but fulfillment---

132
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:06,446
whose flower is accomplishment
and fruit is love

133
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:09,180
They're the ways---
the ways of pleasantness

134
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:12,088
and these parts all leave to peace

135
00:10:13,126 --> 00:10:16,960
Find that tree and
you'll find greatness

136
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,994
ln every land, every language toils
some of these trees

137
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:24,831
And we lndiana have our miss about it

138
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:27,702
That's the tree from which our county
takes the name

139
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:31,602
0ne day l ragged a creature who was
wandering on the shore of the lake

140
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:33,575
in the middle of the county

141
00:10:33,646 --> 00:10:35,705
That creature was the man you all know---

142
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:38,080
Johnny Appleseed who spent his life

143
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:39,549
traveling to the pioneer West

144
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:41,951
planting apples in the wilderness

145
00:10:42,689 --> 00:10:47,626
Among these thousands of seeds
there was one seed he cherished---

146
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:51,493
not Appleseed's, but exotic seed from China---

147
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:54,065
the seed of the golden raintree

148
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:57,967
The creature searched the tiny earth---
the one place---

149
00:10:58,037 --> 00:11:01,370
Well, this one seed by taking root---
blandished

150
00:11:01,908 --> 00:11:04,570
Someone from this county found
that place

151
00:11:04,978 --> 00:11:07,503
But where that raintree was founded?

152
00:11:08,014 --> 00:11:09,777
Nobody knows

153
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,878
Professor, how could such a tree grow

154
00:11:13,987 --> 00:11:16,046
on cement in the county?

155
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:18,682
There's a swamp by the Paradise Lake

156
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,588
There perhaps stands the tree

157
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:24,388
lts sacred tonic trunk towering up
in chill silence

158
00:11:24,464 --> 00:11:27,092
smacks deep in the middle of the county

159
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,734
Find that tree, boy,

160
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:32,396
and you'll learn
the secret of life yourself

161
00:11:33,006 --> 00:11:36,567
Find it and become a hero of
Raintree County

162
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:39,169
Do you really think it there?

163
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:42,810
Why don't you have a real good see
for yourself?

164
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:45,008
Professor, you still haven't answered
the question

165
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:47,018
Do you really think it there?

166
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:50,613
lt's there alright

167
00:11:53,493 --> 00:11:55,427
lt's there---

168
00:11:56,329 --> 00:12:00,026
But the sacred fire is ready to be back

169
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,863
if you look for it

170
00:12:04,003 --> 00:12:06,028
l'm sure you'll find it

171
00:12:06,672 --> 00:12:09,971
What'll happen if what you presume
the raintree we don't find?

172
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:13,636
You see before you a seeker
who didn't find

173
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:20,143
No man of the race as the pitiable and
harmless creature you hold in vain

174
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:26,514
Alright, human---the show is over

175
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:28,116
Now, disappear---all of you

176
00:12:28,227 --> 00:12:31,560
Attention, now easily slip away

177
00:12:32,398 --> 00:12:35,026
Mrs. Gray, it's my time with you, huh?

178
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,275
Nell, what if you and l going to find
the raintree?

179
00:12:43,576 --> 00:12:46,272
Professor said looking for the raintree
appears to be business

180
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:47,437
That asshole

181
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:49,947
So even dressed for it?

182
00:12:50,116 --> 00:12:51,981
Are you serious?

183
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:53,313
Certainly l am ---come on

184
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:54,511
We mind it---find it

185
00:12:54,587 --> 00:12:56,179
Johnny, not now

186
00:12:56,255 --> 00:12:57,051
Why?

187
00:12:57,156 --> 00:12:57,884
You scared?

188
00:12:57,957 --> 00:12:59,322
Ah---is he fooling?

189
00:12:59,392 --> 00:13:00,222
Look at him

190
00:13:00,293 --> 00:13:03,285
What's up because of the tale
told by that idiot---

191
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:05,557
that expert in that calculated sanity?

192
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:06,495
Are you coming?

193
00:13:06,599 --> 00:13:09,796
ls there the swamp---just because
Professor put a barge on you a year ago

194
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:11,403
about the raintree?

195
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:13,803
Would you take care of this for me?

196
00:13:13,906 --> 00:13:15,703
lf you mind l take care this for you?

197
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:17,367
You can go ahead just now

198
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,068
Sure, Johnny---go right ahead

199
00:13:19,178 --> 00:13:22,045
Huh, don't hurry back, brother

200
00:13:26,953 --> 00:13:29,547
l hate with a thing like this happen

201
00:13:29,922 --> 00:13:31,389
l'll never know how it happened

202
00:13:31,457 --> 00:13:34,290
Yeah---it's really a shame

203
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:26,229
Well, Sir---is it Johnny Seanacy?

204
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:27,998
More like Johnny Appleseed

205
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:31,969
Ha---where have you been, Sir?

206
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:34,400
l'm walking

207
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:37,069
Get in, Johnny---we'll take you home

208
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,371
Come on, Johnny---get in there

209
00:16:51,724 --> 00:16:54,284
Poor boy, you look half drowned

210
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,121
lt's nearly all drowned

211
00:16:57,229 --> 00:16:59,925
You mean you look for that---
what you call it?

212
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:03,263
Yes, looking for the watch, Galwood

213
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:04,801
Did you find it?

214
00:17:04,937 --> 00:17:05,926
No

215
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:08,734
0h, what a shame, pal

216
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:11,809
0r a pitiable harmless creature

217
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:15,370
Johnny, tell me what happened

218
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:18,109
Yes, brother---tell us all about it, huh?

219
00:17:18,851 --> 00:17:20,182
Well

220
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:22,821
Boy, it's hard to tell us like this

221
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,381
Galwood, when you tell our folks
about it---

222
00:17:27,493 --> 00:17:28,323
Huh?

223
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:30,852
l mean, say, you get the story straight

224
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,497
l entered the swamp like around here---

225
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,158
see it around that way

226
00:17:36,235 --> 00:17:37,065
What are you---

227
00:17:37,136 --> 00:17:38,899
0h, excuse me---you're quite right

228
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:44,466
l entered the swamp this way and
shove coming along that way

229
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,484
That's how he came over the swamp

230
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:58,045
‘You find the raintree?' l said

231
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:00,320
‘No' he said, ‘l nearly all drowned'

232
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:03,020
l figure that tried to cool his head---

233
00:18:03,095 --> 00:18:04,995
But then she said

234
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,019
What did she say?

235
00:18:06,065 --> 00:18:10,024
She said what a poor
‘pitiable harmless creature'

236
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:12,196
What's going on, boys?

237
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:13,465
0h, hello, Dr. Seanacy---

238
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:15,973
We were just talking about
your son Johnny

239
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,167
Nice brew

240
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:20,474
Don't you know your body is temple
of the spirit?

241
00:18:20,546 --> 00:18:24,414
And you defined and polluted with
the devil brew you've had here

242
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:25,848
Why you say so, but---

243
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:28,045
Why don't you come around to our
next gathering, huh?

244
00:18:28,154 --> 00:18:30,622
Come around to take a total afternoon
to pledge

245
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:32,714
l'll take the pledge right now

246
00:18:32,758 --> 00:18:36,751
0h, no---we want men to take pledge
only when they're sober

247
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:40,463
But if they're sober, what's the sense
having the pledge taken place?

248
00:18:40,566 --> 00:18:44,400
Wait, man---l want to testify that
l've been drunk for 2 weeks

249
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,303
l buy beer, wine and most of them
for friends

250
00:18:47,373 --> 00:18:49,204
l'm drunk here now this minute

251
00:18:49,241 --> 00:18:50,640
l can't find a man who can drink

252
00:18:50,709 --> 00:18:54,873
as much as l can walk straight and
l can still foll any man around the county

253
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:58,246
Thank you now you just---
mark it day and hit town

254
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:02,012
Stand at any corner and listen to the
chapter of referendum of voice---

255
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:03,179
didn't he?

256
00:19:03,255 --> 00:19:08,022
l hoped this subject under discussion
was sufficiently elevated to engage my interest

257
00:19:08,227 --> 00:19:08,989
However---

258
00:19:09,094 --> 00:19:10,459
Professor, we were just talking about

259
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:12,554
your prominent student---

260
00:19:12,598 --> 00:19:16,398
Speak of angels and hear their wings

261
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:23,102
Hm ---not that prominent student

262
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:26,110
Ah---Mr. Gray and his charming wife

263
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:34,583
How the entire world of possibility
did that chilly January win

264
00:19:34,687 --> 00:19:37,247
such a blithesome man?

265
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:38,454
That reminds me---

266
00:19:38,524 --> 00:19:41,322
Do you know the story about the old
judge who married an 18-year-old lady?

267
00:19:41,393 --> 00:19:44,556
Sure you'd excuse me

268
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:46,621
Ha---

269
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:51,566
0h, Pap---

270
00:19:51,637 --> 00:19:53,730
Ha---

271
00:19:58,544 --> 00:20:01,206
Wow, here comes the hero of
Raintree County

272
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,272
l guess he'll go again for the raintree

273
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,339
Ha---

274
00:20:05,417 --> 00:20:07,681
Bob is here shitting his big fat mouth
again

275
00:20:07,753 --> 00:20:09,584
Yes, man---if you really want to be hero

276
00:20:09,655 --> 00:20:11,145
in Raintree County, all you gonna do

277
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,182
ls play the Flash Burgins
for the bare-foot race

278
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,227
Flash Burgins?

279
00:20:15,294 --> 00:20:18,195
So you're Johnny Seanacy

280
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:21,260
Could be---who wants to know?

281
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,960
Do you hear that boy?

282
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:25,668
Should l tell this child who l am?

283
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,466
Why don't you tell him, Flash?

284
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:32,739
Son, you'll give me great satisfaction
and relegation to introduce to you and

285
00:20:32,811 --> 00:20:35,405
these handsome intelligent dummies that

286
00:20:35,481 --> 00:20:39,611
l'm the gentleman
who's better known as Flash Burgins,

287
00:20:39,685 --> 00:20:41,653
fast runner in Raintree County

288
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:43,449
Never heard who he is

289
00:20:43,556 --> 00:20:45,023
Listen, child---he's me

290
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:48,082
l certify most of the runners in the
north and the south

291
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,594
before they're qualified for the
0lympic Games

292
00:20:50,629 --> 00:20:54,190
l'm half the horse and half the asshole
in their spare time

293
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:57,997
l buzz more skulls and rag more campus
and chase more ladies---

294
00:20:58,103 --> 00:20:59,502
That's true

295
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:01,631
And there's a fine jump this year

296
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:05,666
Now little boy like you should
stand by and watch

297
00:21:05,911 --> 00:21:07,538
Now who are you?

298
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,078
l'm Johnny Seanacy and

299
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:16,514
l can outrun any mule in the county

300
00:21:20,793 --> 00:21:23,557
Come on, lad---what are you waiting for?

301
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:25,221
l race you right now

302
00:21:25,297 --> 00:21:26,355
Alright

303
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:29,363
Race---

304
00:21:29,468 --> 00:21:30,093
Race---

305
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:31,966
Race---

306
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:01,126
How about the church over there---
alright?

307
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:02,723
Right, any place you say

308
00:22:09,008 --> 00:22:13,308
0n your march---1 ---2---

309
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:14,910
Stop it

310
00:22:15,114 --> 00:22:15,739
What for?

311
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:17,406
Put your coat on, Johnny

312
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:18,312
What for?

313
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:19,976
They're not racing

314
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:23,613
This man Burgins here is afraid to run
you in regular official

315
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:26,122
because he's frightened of
losing money

316
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:28,726
Here's hat on somebody

317
00:22:29,194 --> 00:22:31,594
l give you 1 for 2 note

318
00:22:31,664 --> 00:22:35,122
You're just talking---
you know no one here can match you

319
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,500
lf someone came up here with hard coins
you'll try to wake out

320
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:41,539
Try me and see

321
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:48,036
Gold?

322
00:22:48,113 --> 00:22:50,980
My yarn is type of a teacher---
a molder for the young mind

323
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:52,017
This is done

324
00:22:52,084 --> 00:22:54,644
This is not much, but it's the mind
l mold

325
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,244
l'll cover---me and the side kick

326
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:57,253
l'll postpone it to July 4

327
00:22:57,322 --> 00:22:58,448
l'll take a bite of that myself

328
00:22:58,557 --> 00:23:00,718
Strange, Johnny---but this is a sure win

329
00:23:00,793 --> 00:23:02,090
See you in the race time, Johnny,

330
00:23:02,161 --> 00:23:04,755
and l promise not to beat you for a while

331
00:23:04,963 --> 00:23:08,091
Until then we'll see

332
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:17,338
Why did you do a thing like that?

333
00:23:17,843 --> 00:23:19,333
Well---

334
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:21,408
Excuse me

335
00:23:29,588 --> 00:23:31,613
lt has been 5 years since anyone laid

336
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,282
a bet against Flash Burgins

337
00:23:33,358 --> 00:23:36,521
Now, if you can beat Flash, we'd clear
the biggest bit of money

338
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:38,425
ever waged in Raintree County

339
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,724
Fine---

340
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:42,164
What happens if l don't and
lose all your money?

341
00:23:42,668 --> 00:23:47,628
My dear boy, l've certain well-laid
plans which at the moment l'm at liberty

342
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,334
as to what do l vote, not even to you---
dear boy

343
00:23:50,676 --> 00:23:55,238
My plan is called for a certain---
concentration of capital

344
00:23:55,681 --> 00:23:58,172
l don't know, Professor---
sometimes you bother me

345
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:00,241
What are you up to?

346
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:03,919
Not more than 20 ways---l guess l can

347
00:24:03,989 --> 00:24:06,355
Now, you relax for the athletic order
ahead

348
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:08,552
You're going to win the race

349
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:11,024
You're going to be the hero in
Raintree County

350
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,290
l got to go

351
00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:13,829
And your beautiful girl

352
00:24:13,899 --> 00:24:17,164
would be the carnival feat on your
sun-colored lucks

353
00:24:33,385 --> 00:24:36,047
Gonna be fine---don't move

354
00:24:36,722 --> 00:24:38,451
Here we go

355
00:24:38,991 --> 00:24:41,084
Look at the birdie---look at the tree

356
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,095
My girls are the prettiest
known to the county

357
00:24:44,163 --> 00:24:45,357
Alright, you can relax

358
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,125
Thank you very much

359
00:24:49,134 --> 00:24:50,328
0h

My girls are the prettiest

374
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:49,221
That's it

375
00:25:49,728 --> 00:25:51,059
That's all?

376
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,327
Huh, how long it's supposed before---

377
00:25:59,071 --> 00:26:01,699

00:26:01,773 --> 00:26:03,707
Maybe 2 or 3 days

379
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:05,209
2 or 3 days?

380
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:07,742

Wait for me

383
00:26:24,463 --> 00:26:27,432
0h, l didn't mean to scream

384
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:30,729
l'm afraid you'll find me
very unlady obviously

385
00:26:33,238 --> 00:26:35,001
l like unladies

386
00:26:35,507 --> 00:26:38,874

00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:40,410

00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,504
Well, me---postponed to July 4

00:26:43,949 --> 00:26:46,008
You're a fast runner?

390
00:26:47,286 --> 00:26:48,776
Pretty fast

391
00:26:49,655 --> 00:26:52,419
l'm pretty fast runner myself

392
00:26:58,096 --> 00:27:01,224
Well, how about a race some time?

393
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,995
You don't believe me, do you?

394
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:05,559
You'll be surprised how fast l can run

395
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:07,935
l'm as good as you can

396
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:12,240
You're Johnny Seanacy?

397
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:15,042

398
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:23,913
Johnny Seanacy---

399
00:27:35,367 --> 00:27:36,356
Professor

400
00:27:36,535 --> 00:27:39,993
Boy---you're definitely ready to graduate

401
00:27:40,138 --> 00:27:41,730
l was never so embarrassed

402
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,702
Why?

403
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:43,604
Because l screamed

404
00:27:43,675 --> 00:27:44,664
l enjoyed it

405
00:27:44,743 --> 00:27:45,971
This is where l live

406
00:27:46,078 --> 00:27:47,010
You live here?

407
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:48,306
Hm ---

408
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:55,819
Come on, Siona---you slow as a swan

409
00:28:00,692 --> 00:28:03,024
l'll be saying goodbye now

410
00:28:04,663 --> 00:28:06,290
You live by yourself?

411
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:09,229

412
00:28:09,334 --> 00:28:11,234

413
00:28:11,336 --> 00:28:13,065
l just opened it up again

414
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:15,197
My Dad loved it too

415
00:28:15,307 --> 00:28:18,640
He was Senator for Louisiana and
New 0rleans before

416
00:28:18,744 --> 00:28:21,212
Some people thought he could be
president

417
00:28:21,313 --> 00:28:23,679
l mean President of the United States

418
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:27,917
We had---that what we had before Daddy died---

419
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,544
the plantation in New 0rleans

420
00:28:29,621 --> 00:28:31,816
We had another one outside Bubana

421
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:35,223
When my aunt died last year---
l inherited this place

422
00:28:35,961 --> 00:28:38,020
My name is Susana

423
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,663
Johnny, you want to say something?

424
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:45,697
0h, no---

425
00:28:49,775 --> 00:28:53,802
You're cute---Johnny Seanacy

426
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:08,753
That July 4 race---what happens
when you win?

427
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:11,024
Well, according to a friend of mine---

428
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:17,261
lf l win, a beautiful girl will place
a wreath of olive leaves

429
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:19,735
on my sun-colored lucks

430
00:29:20,372 --> 00:29:22,863
l like to be that girl

431
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,278
Maybe can be arranged

432
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:33,143
0h, it can be arranged alright---
l'll arrange it

433
00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:43,994
You know l think l'm going to take
my picture too

434
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:45,996
There's always nice surprise---

435
00:29:46,164 --> 00:29:48,462
Huh, what did l say?

436
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:52,533
Nothing, Galwood---
that was made for Johnny

437
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:06,313

00:30:31,143 --> 00:30:32,041

Thank you, Ed

440
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:36,876
Nell

441
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:52,289
Ah, Johnny, there you're---

442
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,295
l'm looking all over for you

443
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,525
How are you feeling?

444
00:30:55,634 --> 00:30:56,658
Nervous

445
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,635
What you need is calm down---
you nerve is over juice

446
00:30:59,738 --> 00:31:00,329
Good luck, Johnny---

447
00:31:00,372 --> 00:31:01,464
l got a payback on you

448
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,007
Thank you---l'll do my best

449
00:31:03,074 --> 00:31:04,302
How about a little drink?

450
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:06,070
0h, l used to lemonade

451
00:31:06,178 --> 00:31:07,110
Lemonade?

452
00:31:07,145 --> 00:31:08,737
Lemonade is something
that will give you ulcer

453
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:12,214
What l mean was how about a little
drink of Bourbon

454
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:13,273
Bourbon---me?

455
00:31:13,385 --> 00:31:16,047
Now, don't get excited---
all l mean was just---

456
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:17,418
Even the present President would agree

457
00:31:17,522 --> 00:31:20,685
the whole time l put it in, Jack

458
00:31:22,827 --> 00:31:24,522
A draw---

459
00:31:24,696 --> 00:31:25,458
God bless you

460
00:31:25,564 --> 00:31:27,327
How about a little drink?

461
00:31:27,465 --> 00:31:28,523
This old horse---

462
00:31:28,633 --> 00:31:30,601
he doesn't think
l shouldn't touch any draught

463
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:32,227
Just to be sociable

00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:35,262
Well, l'll give if you both drink

465
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,705

What's going to happen l come out here---

468

Son, it'd be good for you to turn up
those muscles that's give you extra---

469
00:31:44,783 --> 00:31:45,715
Forget about it, Professor

470
00:31:45,784 --> 00:31:48,947

471
00:31:50,188 --> 00:31:54,784

Ah, what do we get?

477
00:32:18,683 --> 00:32:20,514
How about a little Bourbon?

478
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:24,385
There's a couple of bottles right
out of steer---a bottle for each boy

479
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:29,960
Ah, just a minute---

481
00:32:32,264 --> 00:32:32,787
Why?

482
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:34,764
l just don't want any trick monkey do

483
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,926
What are you---
we just have a bottle for each

484
00:32:37,035 --> 00:32:38,832
They'll drink from the same bottle

485
00:32:38,903 --> 00:32:40,268
Wow, you don't mean to say---

486
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:41,600
Kid me a fool, Professor

487
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,574
That's a new situation that you may do yourself

488
00:32:43,642 --> 00:32:44,802
May l---?

489
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:49,175
Professor, l don't trust you---

490
00:32:54,352 --> 00:32:57,685
lt's tea---cold tea

491

And fill it right up

493
00:33:07,299 --> 00:33:08,891
Alright, man

Johnny

496
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:32,016
There's nothing to it---nothing to it

497
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:37,828
Come on---just fill the glasses

498
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:41,991
Johnny, you're unable---

00:33:52,677 --> 00:33:53,166
0h, that's enough

Gentlemen, this boy is not used to
strong alcohol

503
00:33:54,846 --> 00:33:56,040
Just to be sociable

504
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:57,376
Professor, don't worry about me

505
00:33:57,449 --> 00:33:59,349
There's nothing to it, really

506
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:02,212
Stand back---give the boy a chance

507
00:34:13,732 --> 00:34:16,599
Good work to Jack---alright to youth

508
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:18,999
New gentlemen, stand back---give me room

509
00:34:19,104 --> 00:34:20,594
How you like that?

510
00:34:46,097 --> 00:34:49,157

That's enough---dry him off

514
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,004
That's only God would choose

515
00:35:32,277 --> 00:35:34,507
He's out there now---
laughing to beat the kid

516
00:35:34,612 --> 00:35:37,172
How dare you play a trick like this
on your best friends?

517
00:35:37,282 --> 00:35:39,910
And poor Johnny here who never drinks
in his life

518
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:42,886
0h, he'd have been killed fresh

519
00:35:42,987 --> 00:35:44,511

He bid me to chase---yelling for action

521
00:35:46,524 --> 00:35:48,151
You'd better get Johnny out there

522
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:53,923

You think too close?

537
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:44,971

00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:32,820
To me is 150

544
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:35,860
Where's Flash?

545
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:39,465
The king is there---long live the king

546
00:37:51,683 --> 00:37:53,207
Johnny

547
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:55,650
Nice to see you around here

548
00:37:57,121 --> 00:37:58,179
Quiet voice

549
00:37:58,256 --> 00:38:00,986
You've beautifully done it

550
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:06,993
Johnny Seanacy, allow me to present
to you on behalf of all these people

551
00:38:07,098 --> 00:38:11,899
Present this wreath to the---
victory belongs to this boy

552
00:38:15,974 --> 00:38:18,670
What about that race you and l
going to run?

553
00:38:19,677 --> 00:38:22,043
l wouldn't have a chance

554
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,895
0h

555
00:38:41,699 --> 00:38:44,862
You, dear boy, are the wicked
pagan spirit

556
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:47,096
And you're the poor the financer

557
00:38:47,472 --> 00:38:50,464
Today is the day of high hopes and
fair promises

558
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:54,011
Ah, l wonder the worker of the age

559
00:38:54,112 --> 00:38:55,909
Professor, you've enough zidar

560
00:38:56,014 --> 00:38:59,643
Hm, not enough---l gonna catch up with it

561
00:38:59,751 --> 00:39:02,379
l've to protect my league

562
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:09,890
Why don't you run away and play with
this charming ambassador's

563
00:39:10,028 --> 00:39:12,588
in the land of magnolia?

564
00:39:14,766 --> 00:39:17,064
Let's go swimming---come on

565
00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:17,964
What?

566
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:19,400
You're sick of that thing

567
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,631
But you can think anything

568
00:39:26,377 --> 00:39:35,843
Ah, life---liberty and pursuit
of happiness

569
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:28,432
0h, l gonna hate to leave here

570
00:40:29,273 --> 00:40:32,208
Leave---when are you leaving?

571
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:36,911
Tomorrow---l'm going back to New 0rleans

572
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:40,176
You can't stay for a while?

573
00:40:41,486 --> 00:40:43,249
0h, you're sweet

574
00:40:43,354 --> 00:40:45,447
But you can come to visit me some time

575
00:40:45,556 --> 00:40:47,547
You'd love there for sure

576
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:49,286
You have to go?

577
00:40:49,393 --> 00:40:52,624
Well, l only came up here to resettle
the house

578
00:40:53,197 --> 00:40:57,861
l was going to sell it---
but l think l'll hold it for a while

579
00:40:58,002 --> 00:40:59,833
When you'll be back?

580
00:41:01,439 --> 00:41:06,206
l don't know---maybe never

581
00:41:08,012 --> 00:41:10,276
Tell me about the raintree

582
00:41:11,649 --> 00:41:13,173
Where did you hear about that?

583
00:41:13,284 --> 00:41:15,115
Do you think you'll never find it?

584
00:41:15,553 --> 00:41:17,384
You don't think it a joke?

585
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:22,282
No, l believe it

586
00:41:24,428 --> 00:41:27,295
l'll be looking for the raintree always

587
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,591
Supposing you do find it---

588
00:41:33,004 --> 00:41:36,770
0h, it opens all locks---

589
00:41:36,908 --> 00:41:39,138
it heals all wounds

590
00:41:40,812 --> 00:41:52,349
Yes---maybe l'll never see you again

591
00:42:38,536 --> 00:42:39,730
Nell

592
00:42:40,037 --> 00:42:41,561
Nell---

593
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:49,936
lt's silly---you've been running away
from me for weeks

594
00:42:50,748 --> 00:42:52,909
Why don't you talk to me?

595
00:42:53,517 --> 00:42:57,715
You weren't so anxious to talk to me
when that girl was in town

596
00:42:59,357 --> 00:43:00,346
What do you mean?

597
00:43:00,458 --> 00:43:03,291
Are you mad just because l saw her
a couple of times

598
00:43:03,828 --> 00:43:05,989
A couple of times?

599
00:43:11,802 --> 00:43:16,865
Huh, did you like that book of poetry
l gave you?

600
00:43:17,408 --> 00:43:19,103
Yeah

601
00:43:20,278 --> 00:43:25,910
No, Baron was immoral---
he was a libertine

602
00:43:26,117 --> 00:43:27,379
He was a great writer

603
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:30,614
l think being a good man is
far more important

604
00:43:30,721 --> 00:43:33,622
Maybe a writer has a lot of experience

605
00:43:34,258 --> 00:43:38,695
0h, so that's it---so that's what you're
doing with Susana

606
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:42,591
Johnny Seanacy---Baron of Raintree County

607
00:43:43,267 --> 00:43:45,758
That's right---l'm a genius

608
00:43:47,305 --> 00:43:49,205
Maybe someday l'll write

609
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:50,739
About what?

610
00:43:50,808 --> 00:43:53,333
About the sullen tales l've known?

611
00:43:53,911 --> 00:43:58,610
No, l think l'll write Raintree County---

612
00:44:00,952 --> 00:44:03,978
about the lndians
when they first came here...

613
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:07,149
about Johnny Appleseed and the raintree---

614
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:09,452
The raintree?

615
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:11,552
That's another thing, Johnny

616
00:44:11,629 --> 00:44:14,097
That day you went chasing the raintree
l was waiting for you

617
00:44:14,165 --> 00:44:17,498
l didn't know where you had gone---
but l knew the swamp

618
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:21,465
l'm sorry---l guess l didn't realize

619
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:23,871
You just didn't realize anything

620
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:33,607
Johnny---to some people you're a man
of great importance

621
00:44:33,718 --> 00:44:39,384
Your exact location is of intense
concern to---to some people

622
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:52,734
l'd better go, Johnny

623
00:44:52,837 --> 00:44:53,667
Not yet

624
00:44:53,738 --> 00:44:54,898
Johnny

625
00:44:54,972 --> 00:44:56,303
Please

626
00:44:57,375 --> 00:44:59,434
Johnny, l'd better go

627
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:01,708
lt's getting late---we'd better go

628
00:45:01,812 --> 00:45:03,541
0h, no---you don't

629
00:45:04,015 --> 00:45:04,879
Who's that?

630
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:07,543
Why don't you move up here and
find out?

631
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:17,594
So it was you

632
00:45:17,728 --> 00:45:19,593
Who would you think it was?

633
00:45:19,697 --> 00:45:21,892
You know anything about this?

634
00:45:22,433 --> 00:45:24,025
You got anything to do with this?

635
00:45:24,135 --> 00:45:25,124
Doing that?

636
00:45:25,236 --> 00:45:28,433
The Professor---he ran off with Lady Gray

637
00:45:28,973 --> 00:45:32,374
lf he is still in the county, he'll get
a chance out of thousand to get alive

638
00:45:32,476 --> 00:45:34,103
We've got hundred men looking for her

639
00:45:34,211 --> 00:45:35,701
Nobody can come to this county and

640
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,543
run off with another man's wife

641
00:45:37,615 --> 00:45:40,607
lt occurs to me, young man, you're
a friend of this---

642
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:42,145
this man's

643
00:45:42,253 --> 00:45:44,619
But a thing like this---
there're no nobbles

644
00:45:44,688 --> 00:45:46,849
Whose side are you on?

645
00:45:47,925 --> 00:45:49,984
l'm taking Nell home

646
00:45:50,294 --> 00:45:54,060
No, l'll see you tomorrow

647
00:45:55,666 --> 00:45:58,999
Alright, young man---l'm still waiting
for your answer

648
00:45:59,103 --> 00:46:03,597
You'll get yourself a long wait---
l'm going home

649
00:46:18,389 --> 00:46:19,981
Hello, Johnny

650
00:46:25,396 --> 00:46:27,557
And what have you been up to?

651
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:29,098
Where's Lydia?

652
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:34,696
Wonderful woman---l did try carrying her
away from her husband

653
00:46:34,805 --> 00:46:37,000
That's the day you won your race

654
00:46:37,074 --> 00:46:38,598
Where's she?

655
00:46:39,376 --> 00:46:41,970
She had missed the train
at the 3-mile junction

656
00:46:42,046 --> 00:46:44,514
0r we'd have been hundred miles away
by now

657
00:46:45,316 --> 00:46:49,150
As l got back to the buggy, 3 men
with guns marched up to the platform

658
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:51,847
l grasped the situation once thereon---

659
00:46:51,956 --> 00:46:54,015
But that was only the beginning

660
00:46:54,458 --> 00:46:57,859
0n the way back, the first man l met
asked if l heard about the man

661
00:46:57,928 --> 00:46:59,896
who ran off with a man's wife

662
00:46:59,964 --> 00:47:02,558
l'm a stranger here myself, l said

663
00:47:03,434 --> 00:47:07,734
0n the road, l met a troop of camions
caring for the station---

664
00:47:08,372 --> 00:47:10,169
Where's Lydia?

665
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:13,910
She's home right now
waiting for Mr. Gray

666
00:47:14,378 --> 00:47:16,539
l took her straight back home

667
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:19,882
As for myself, l took off
like a street beggar

668
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:24,153
l guess you think l'm a bit scoundrel
right, Johnny?

669
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:29,953
l don't know---l don't know what l think

670
00:47:31,228 --> 00:47:33,253
Don't think too bad of me

671
00:47:34,198 --> 00:47:37,326
l suppose the heroic thing to be done
would be to stick around and

672
00:47:37,401 --> 00:47:41,098
let the outraged husband discharge
his fury with a shotgun

673
00:47:41,505 --> 00:47:43,132
But l hate that Sanctimonious warthog

674
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,504
too much to give him the satisfaction

675
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:48,572
Besides, l was scared

676
00:47:50,481 --> 00:47:52,210
But one thing, Johnny---

677
00:47:52,683 --> 00:47:55,982
Nothing happened---absolutely nothing

678
00:47:56,086 --> 00:47:58,611
And that's the end just for it all

679
00:47:58,722 --> 00:48:01,691
lf there's any phantom to be hanged---
the county would say

680
00:48:02,826 --> 00:48:05,420
there might be some truth in it

681
00:48:05,529 --> 00:48:06,655
Alright

682
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,198
l just managed the whole thing badly

683
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:10,794
Did you?

684
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:13,234
Come on

685
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:14,698
Where are we going?

686
00:48:15,773 --> 00:48:17,798
You got to get out of the county

687
00:48:17,908 --> 00:48:20,172
Well, good idea---it occurred to me

688
00:48:21,378 --> 00:48:24,176
Johnny, why not up with us?

689
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:26,682
Study my example---
get out of Raintree County---

690
00:48:26,784 --> 00:48:28,217
someone like you with a shotgun

691
00:48:28,285 --> 00:48:29,946
Not me---you

692
00:48:30,387 --> 00:48:32,184
l guess you're right

693
00:48:32,289 --> 00:48:35,986
(ln French) Good for you---
good for us both

694
00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:47,801
There he is

695
00:48:54,712 --> 00:48:55,872
Come on---

696
00:48:57,681 --> 00:48:59,512
Get on the train

697
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:01,844
Goodbye, dear boy---

698
00:49:01,952 --> 00:49:03,544
go on for great better things

699
00:49:03,654 --> 00:49:05,349
Get on the train

700
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:20,962
Wee want him

701
00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:22,805
Where you've been, Mr. Gray?

702
00:49:22,906 --> 00:49:25,636
Your wife has been home
for the past 12 hours

703
00:49:25,743 --> 00:49:28,177
Nothing happened---absolutely nothing

704
00:49:28,545 --> 00:49:29,807
He's a liar

705
00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:35,643
You want to shoot me and later find out
he was right?

706
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:41,217
What are you afraid of?

707
00:49:41,825 --> 00:49:43,952
You want him ---you take him

708
00:49:44,161 --> 00:49:46,129
l'm going home

709
00:49:47,965 --> 00:49:49,796
You get out of my way, boy---

710
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,232
or l'll cut your eyes out

711
00:49:59,543 --> 00:50:00,942
Goodbye, dear friend

712
00:50:01,078 --> 00:50:03,774
Remember me as a man who loves
Raintree County---

713
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:07,783
but just happens to lose
most of the people in it

714
00:50:30,908 --> 00:50:32,671
Johnny

715
00:50:44,822 --> 00:50:59,032
Johnny, l had to come back---
l'm going to have a baby

716
00:51:07,511 --> 00:51:11,880
Johnny, this letter was left
on the door steps for you

717
00:51:11,982 --> 00:51:13,347
0h, thank you

718
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:16,749
Johnny, this marriage you announced---

719
00:51:18,722 --> 00:51:20,212
Sit down

720
00:51:22,393 --> 00:51:26,261
l can't honestly say l'm entirely
approved specifically---

721
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:31,361
But, under the circumstances of necessary
haste with which you've gone into---

722
00:51:31,468 --> 00:51:34,198
l know---l certainly understand

723
00:51:38,742 --> 00:51:42,041
Anyway, l think you're doing
a manly thing

724
00:51:43,647 --> 00:51:47,606
l hope the young lady achieves
what she appears to be

725
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:52,086
Judge not the year be not judged

726
00:51:52,156 --> 00:51:53,817
l know, Sir

727
00:51:58,095 --> 00:52:00,359
Marry her, son---and be happy

728
00:52:00,931 --> 00:52:02,262
Thank you

729
00:52:02,332 --> 00:52:03,822
You need any money?

730
00:52:04,234 --> 00:52:06,600
l don't know---l don't think so right now

731
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,872
0h, there was a letter that
came for you---

732
00:52:11,942 --> 00:52:13,842
l---l have it here

733
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:15,936
0f course

734
00:52:48,612 --> 00:52:49,772
Hello

735
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,507
Hello, Johnny

736
00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:55,050
l got your letter

737
00:52:57,688 --> 00:53:03,126
Johnny, as one for whom you want for perfection,

738
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:05,990
l just want to say good luck

739
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:08,759
and wish you all the happiness
in the world

740
00:53:09,867 --> 00:53:14,702
And the poem you wrote for me and
the picture you gave me---

741
00:53:14,805 --> 00:53:17,603
l just feel that l want to return it

742
00:53:17,674 --> 00:53:20,700
l thought maybe you want it back

743
00:53:27,384 --> 00:53:29,579
l really don't want to give it up

744
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:34,486
lt's just that---everything has changed

745
00:53:35,325 --> 00:53:37,452
and l don't mean anything to you

746
00:53:37,528 --> 00:53:40,361
We don't mean anything
to each other anymore

747
00:53:40,497 --> 00:53:46,367
Nell---l'm sorry

748
00:53:47,804 --> 00:53:51,035
lt's not your fault, Johnny---
everybody knows that

749
00:53:51,108 --> 00:53:52,939
lt was July 4---

750
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:55,638
You drank all that whisky and
you went out to the race

751
00:53:55,712 --> 00:53:59,478
No, l was responsible---nobody else

752
00:54:00,884 --> 00:54:04,012
That's so much like you, Johnny

753
00:54:04,755 --> 00:54:07,417
Why do you have so much conscience?

754
00:54:09,059 --> 00:54:11,391
Maybe that's why l love you

755
00:54:12,195 --> 00:54:15,028
Johnny, l love you so much

756
00:54:15,499 --> 00:54:21,529
Did that l wish l didn't---l wish l---

757
00:54:33,417 --> 00:54:41,483
The words of Lawrence Baron on the back
you wrote for me---

758
00:54:42,593 --> 00:54:49,465
‘Forever love and before ever..-'

759
00:54:52,135 --> 00:54:54,228
Still forever---

760
00:54:58,275 --> 00:55:00,140
l wish you well

761
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:24,692
You're right, Mrs. Seanacy

762
00:55:24,835 --> 00:55:32,537
l like the river---it even smells good

763
00:55:33,243 --> 00:55:35,404
l really don't understand it

764
00:55:35,612 --> 00:55:37,978
Would you smell mouse like it too?

765
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:39,981
Now, there's something l understand

766
00:55:40,517 --> 00:55:43,918
All you've to do is go south once and
you'll love it

767
00:55:45,422 --> 00:55:50,086
Well, a north Yanky to the south
is not so easy to understand

768
00:55:51,428 --> 00:55:53,658
You ever read <Uncle Tom's Cabin>?

769
00:55:54,264 --> 00:55:56,562
<Uncle Tom's Cabin>?

770
00:55:58,735 --> 00:56:01,932
l've married an abolitionist, have l?

771
00:56:02,105 --> 00:56:04,573
That's skeleton in my classic

772
00:56:04,875 --> 00:56:07,435
Now, you mustn't joke about it

773
00:56:10,747 --> 00:56:12,078
Are they friendly?

774
00:56:12,182 --> 00:56:15,242
Anyway, the worst thing---
has ever been the abolition

775
00:56:15,352 --> 00:56:16,649
Like what?

776
00:56:19,456 --> 00:56:24,018
That cabin Negro blooded---Negroid

777
00:56:24,327 --> 00:56:28,195
Just one little tiny drop in the person
makes him all Negro

778
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:32,461
They just can't tell either

779
00:56:36,339 --> 00:56:39,103
ls it gonna be room for 2 of us?

780
00:56:40,777 --> 00:56:44,269
lt's only sort of a hobby---
l'm taking with me wherever l go

781
00:56:44,414 --> 00:56:46,974
This is Jimmy---l've had it the longest

782
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:48,244
Where did you get it?

783
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:49,785
He needs a bath

784
00:56:54,024 --> 00:56:58,893
0h, Johnny---forgive me my foolishness

785
00:57:23,353 --> 00:57:26,186
0h, l do love you so

786
00:57:28,892 --> 00:57:33,886
When l'm with you, l feel like nothing

787
00:57:33,997 --> 00:57:37,057
can happen to me as long as l have you

788
00:57:39,136 --> 00:57:41,127
You won't let anything happen to me

789
00:57:41,204 --> 00:57:43,172
Will you, Johnny?

790
00:58:28,485 --> 00:58:30,043
Enjoy yourself, Johnny?

791
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,281
Very much

792
00:58:32,856 --> 00:58:36,485
Then what do you think about
the ever-glooming south?

793
00:58:36,593 --> 00:58:38,185
As l said, l love it---l do

794
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:40,593
That sounds general, isn't it?

795
00:58:40,764 --> 00:58:42,254
What you really think of it?

796
00:58:43,066 --> 00:58:46,126
Well, Sir---l think highly of it

797
00:58:46,603 --> 00:58:48,764
l'm only worried by all this
aristocrat succession

798
00:58:48,872 --> 00:58:49,702
Succession?

799
00:58:49,773 --> 00:58:50,797
Remember, young man---

800
00:58:50,907 --> 00:58:54,536
Union belongs to those who keep breath
in the cabinet

801
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:57,375
What cousin said means, Johnny---
if succession comes---

802
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:59,607
the north should succeed

803
00:58:59,716 --> 00:59:00,774
Hear him say---

804
00:59:00,884 --> 00:59:02,476
Sir, one thing you must understand

805
00:59:02,586 --> 00:59:03,951
Johnny is a poet

806
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,817
He stays 2 months with his girlfriend---

807
00:59:05,956 --> 00:59:08,424
therefore, he loves south

808
00:59:08,491 --> 00:59:10,516
l'm not so sure you prove it

809
00:59:10,627 --> 00:59:12,424
That's because he's a moralist

810
00:59:12,495 --> 00:59:14,292
You won't get straight answers from him

811
00:59:14,364 --> 00:59:16,798
He'll draw up opinion for another name

812
00:59:16,867 --> 00:59:18,266
He's also a dreamer---

813
00:59:18,335 --> 00:59:21,065
a seeker for the
meaning of life with capital wealth

814
00:59:21,905 --> 00:59:24,840
Sir, your search has ended

815
00:59:24,941 --> 00:59:28,138
Stay here with us and help us
to build our dream

816
00:59:28,211 --> 00:59:30,076
We have thousand dreams

817
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:33,240
for a great republic on this soil of merit

818
00:59:33,316 --> 00:59:39,050
with it's pretty homes and
most beautiful---women

819
00:59:39,155 --> 00:59:41,555
0h, Sam ---you're wonderful

820
00:59:41,625 --> 00:59:44,389
You shelf like some golden pitfalls

821
00:59:45,962 --> 00:59:49,898
Cousin Sam ---Johnny doesn't like slavery

822
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:54,603
Does Johnny like to waive slaves
in the north?

823
00:59:54,704 --> 00:59:56,672
Johnny doesn't like misery anywhere---

824
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:57,764
north or south

825
00:59:57,841 --> 00:59:59,775
Here comes misery now---my wife

826
00:59:59,843 --> 01:00:01,834
We're talking about the north, my dear---

827
01:00:01,945 --> 01:00:03,310
slaves in the north---

828
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,042
Sam, you're boring---

829
01:00:06,483 --> 01:00:09,247
l'll borrow your husband for a while

830
01:00:09,853 --> 01:00:11,377
Excuse me

831
01:00:39,716 --> 01:00:42,150
Don't look so serious

832
01:00:42,919 --> 01:00:46,912
Here old men can only play
their dream of gold---

833
01:00:47,023 --> 01:00:49,548
lt's not that---l'm counting

834
01:00:51,328 --> 01:00:54,388
Cousin Johnny, are you ever in love?

835
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:55,555
Huh?

836
01:00:55,632 --> 01:01:01,002
l mean---were you ever really---in love?

837
01:01:01,137 --> 01:01:04,504
Cousin dear, l'm in love

838
01:01:05,709 --> 01:01:08,269
You know l love the way you say that

839
01:01:08,378 --> 01:01:12,610
You did such a noble sound
in your precious accent---

840
01:01:19,055 --> 01:01:24,891
Frankly, Johnny---cousin Susana just
isn't the right type for you

841
01:01:24,995 --> 01:01:27,930
You're an attractive young man

842
01:01:28,365 --> 01:01:34,201
0h, Susana, why disposed---
she didn't marry down here?

843
01:01:35,805 --> 01:01:39,206
l guess supposing down here people know
too much about her

844
01:01:40,543 --> 01:01:42,534
Don't you hear me?

845
01:01:44,347 --> 01:01:47,407
You've borrowed my husband long enough---
cousin Barbara---

846
01:01:47,584 --> 01:01:48,846
l reclaim him

847
01:01:48,918 --> 01:01:50,476
0f course

848
01:02:31,795 --> 01:02:33,695
l must've been beautiful

849
01:02:33,863 --> 01:02:36,024
0h, it was, Johnny

850
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:40,628
lt was all white when
l was a little girl

851
01:03:13,436 --> 01:03:16,997
Marble house was right above over there

852
01:03:18,174 --> 01:03:22,076
Johnny, our neggars built it by hands

853
01:03:23,246 --> 01:03:25,544
The furniture came from France

854
01:03:25,682 --> 01:03:27,513
lt was so beautiful

855
01:03:28,017 --> 01:03:32,283
The tower columns shed the veranda

856
01:03:32,388 --> 01:03:35,186
l used to play there when it rained

857
01:03:35,592 --> 01:03:42,191
The garden was so lovely cool
with roses and lilies

858
01:03:42,332 --> 01:03:44,493
How this fire started?

859
01:03:47,604 --> 01:03:49,037
No one knows

860
01:03:49,339 --> 01:03:50,829
Really?

861
01:03:52,509 --> 01:03:55,410
That was my Daddy and Mama buried

862
01:03:55,545 --> 01:03:58,241
l was lucky to get out alive

863
01:03:58,381 --> 01:04:00,042
l slept next to Henrietta at this room

864
01:04:00,216 --> 01:04:01,046
She was burnt too

865
01:04:01,151 --> 01:04:02,709
Who was Henrietta?

866
01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:08,156
She was my dearest friend---
she was a great lady

867
01:04:08,591 --> 01:04:10,149
How old were you?

868
01:04:12,128 --> 01:04:15,222
Three---maybe 4

869
01:04:15,398 --> 01:04:17,025
And you could remember it all?

870
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:22,997
Yes---no, l don't know

871
01:04:23,673 --> 01:04:27,040
l can't remember what l exactly saw

872
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:29,770
l was told later on

873
01:04:43,526 --> 01:04:44,686
0h

874
01:04:45,094 --> 01:04:46,652
What's the matter?

875
01:04:47,564 --> 01:04:50,931
These used to be a little cabin
over there

876
01:04:51,834 --> 01:04:54,064
l guess it's gone

877
01:05:04,314 --> 01:05:06,874
This is where they buried her, Johnny

878
01:05:07,317 --> 01:05:10,218
0h, you can't imagine
how lovely she was

879
01:05:10,386 --> 01:05:15,289
She took care of me---
she was a great lady

880
01:05:15,458 --> 01:05:19,656
l'm not ashamed to say that
although she was a Negro

881
01:05:19,829 --> 01:05:20,853
0ne of these slaves?

882
01:05:20,964 --> 01:05:23,694
0h, no---she came from Cuba

883
01:05:23,766 --> 01:05:25,563
That was where l was born---Havana

884
01:05:25,668 --> 01:05:27,499
Daddy was there for several years

885
01:05:27,604 --> 01:05:29,731
and then came back with us

886
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:34,305
lt's funny to think of her now

887
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:41,145
Think of her lying down there
if she's lying down there

888
01:05:41,317 --> 01:05:44,013
What do you mean
‘if she's lying down there' ?

889
01:05:45,822 --> 01:05:47,881
lt's sort of family scandal

890
01:05:47,957 --> 01:05:50,858
Some people say the graves were messed

891
01:05:50,927 --> 01:05:56,160
My aunt said she wasn't sure if it was
her Henrietta sleeping in Mama's grave

892
01:05:58,701 --> 01:06:01,067
l---l don't understand

893
01:06:08,945 --> 01:06:14,508
l love you, Henrietta---l love you

894
01:06:18,154 --> 01:06:19,644
Dear

895
01:06:24,861 --> 01:06:27,659
Johnny, l know you don't understand

896
01:06:31,234 --> 01:06:33,930
There was everything to me

897
01:06:36,005 --> 01:06:41,136
because of her l was never alone

898
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:56,447
And now---do you feel someone watching
over us?

899
01:06:57,460 --> 01:06:59,553
Just nobody here

900
01:07:01,431 --> 01:07:03,228
How do you know?

901
01:07:08,171 --> 01:07:13,803
Johnny, about this---this neggar girl---

902
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:16,241
l---l lied to you about it

903
01:07:16,346 --> 01:07:18,109
lt---it never happened

904
01:07:19,515 --> 01:07:21,745
Why did you tell me this?

905
01:07:23,853 --> 01:07:28,517
You asked me about it

906
01:07:29,759 --> 01:07:32,387
Well, you don't think my Mama---

907
01:07:32,495 --> 01:07:35,589
You don't think my Mama would ever
allow me to---

908
01:07:36,899 --> 01:07:39,993
l---l was always with my Mama---

909
01:07:40,837 --> 01:07:43,499
l was always by her side

910
01:07:44,474 --> 01:07:48,240
Why---why she loved me so much?

911
01:07:49,612 --> 01:07:53,207
She never allowed me out of her sight

912
01:07:53,816 --> 01:07:57,946
l---l was always with her

913
01:07:59,122 --> 01:08:04,458
Susana---should we go home?

914
01:08:48,771 --> 01:08:52,104
Good evening, l'm looking for Mr. Durex

915
01:08:53,042 --> 01:08:55,101
Come on in, dear

916
01:09:07,824 --> 01:09:08,984
Right in here

917
01:09:09,091 --> 01:09:10,388
Thank you

918
01:09:31,481 --> 01:09:32,675
Bobbie

919
01:09:33,216 --> 01:09:35,309
Johnny, how do you know l was here?

920
01:09:35,418 --> 01:09:36,817
Barbara said you were with Sam ---

921
01:09:36,886 --> 01:09:38,353
she said you were here

922
01:09:38,421 --> 01:09:43,290
Listen---l like to talk to you

923
01:09:43,493 --> 01:09:44,790
Can you wait there?

924
01:09:44,861 --> 01:09:46,055
We'd drive miles home
when we could talk then

925
01:09:46,095 --> 01:09:48,029
No

926
01:09:51,667 --> 01:09:53,567
Let's go in there

927
01:09:59,242 --> 01:10:01,403
Would you excuse us?

928
01:10:03,312 --> 01:10:04,939
Johnny, how about a drink?

929
01:10:05,081 --> 01:10:06,981
Bobbie, what's all about

930
01:10:07,116 --> 01:10:09,016
Susana's family and the fire?

931
01:10:10,987 --> 01:10:13,182
Well, it's just old family scandal---

932
01:10:13,289 --> 01:10:16,315
Johnny---but it's pretty gluesome

933
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:18,916
You see the day they had trouble to
identify a man in the,

934
01:10:19,028 --> 01:10:20,222
fire but a woman

935
01:10:20,329 --> 01:10:25,028
And the woman was another matter and
one of them was a lady of color

936
01:10:25,801 --> 01:10:27,962
Why you go after that?

937
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:29,799
l like to know

938
01:10:30,506 --> 01:10:35,739
Well it all began when Susana's mother---
you know

939
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:37,776
l don't know

940
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:39,745
She went insane

941
01:10:39,815 --> 01:10:43,182
Susana's father gave up everything
to take care of her

942
01:10:43,286 --> 01:10:46,585
At last he gave us his business
to seek her sense

943
01:10:46,656 --> 01:10:49,557
But what they tried was too far gone

944
01:10:49,659 --> 01:10:51,684
She couldn't be cured at all

945
01:10:52,295 --> 01:10:53,990
lt was in Cuba

946
01:10:54,297 --> 01:10:56,595
That's where he met another woman

947
01:10:57,533 --> 01:10:59,364
What about the fire?

948
01:10:59,468 --> 01:11:00,799
There were some wrangles---

949
01:11:00,903 --> 01:11:02,962
2 bodies were found together

950
01:11:03,072 --> 01:11:03,936
So?

951
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,974
So it looks like something funny
had been going on

952
01:11:06,075 --> 01:11:08,373
They might've been killed
before the fire

953
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:11,378
l mean everybody else got up and away

954
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:12,913
Why didn't they?

955
01:11:13,015 --> 01:11:16,610
That's the question of identification---
which woman was that woman?

956
01:11:16,852 --> 01:11:17,750
Which?

957
01:11:17,853 --> 01:11:19,878
There was talk of Susana's father with

958
01:11:19,956 --> 01:11:22,550
the woman who was found in shock

959
01:11:22,858 --> 01:11:24,758
The woman---the woman---
who was found with?

960
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:26,487
l exaggerated, Johnny

961
01:11:26,596 --> 01:11:27,585
Anyway, the thing was hers---

962
01:11:27,663 --> 01:11:29,961
it was better the way as it was

963
01:11:30,032 --> 01:11:31,556
0f course, there was a lot of talks---

964
01:11:31,634 --> 01:11:33,693
You know how woman talk in this family---

965
01:11:33,769 --> 01:11:35,634
women are worse the most

966
01:11:35,871 --> 01:11:37,270
l don't want to scare you, boy

967
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:38,238
But you don't need a private life

968
01:11:38,307 --> 01:11:39,365
because you've a beautiful wife

969
01:11:39,475 --> 01:11:40,806
That's the worth of it

970
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:43,470
Alright, what happened after the fire?

971
01:11:43,579 --> 01:11:45,570
Well, nothing much

972
01:11:45,681 --> 01:11:50,618
0h, the excitement Susana had taken
and disappeared for 2 or 3 days

973
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:51,812
l forget now

974
01:11:51,887 --> 01:11:53,320
They found her finally

975
01:11:53,389 --> 01:11:56,449
She was in Henrietta's cabin
all the time

976
01:11:56,525 --> 01:11:57,992
And Susana had to go up

977
01:11:58,094 --> 01:12:00,358
to her aunt's place in Pennsylvania

978
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:02,989
That's all l know about it

979
01:12:03,065 --> 01:12:04,464
Does anybody else know?

980
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:06,330
There's just one person---

981
01:12:06,402 --> 01:12:07,096
Who?

982
01:12:07,169 --> 01:12:09,694
You've to wait until she's ready
to tell you

983
01:12:10,072 --> 01:12:11,403
Not Susana?

984
01:12:11,507 --> 01:12:12,997
lt's Susana

985
01:12:13,075 --> 01:12:15,100
Susana was 3 years old

986
01:12:15,177 --> 01:12:17,941
0h, my boy---you think you marry a child?

987
01:12:18,414 --> 01:12:24,284
Well, at time of the fire, my cousin
Susana was 9 years old

988
01:12:31,494 --> 01:12:35,055
Dear, l got it away from here

989
01:12:35,665 --> 01:12:39,157
Alright, Johnny---where should we go?

990
01:12:39,635 --> 01:12:41,296
Could we go to Europe?

991
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:43,736
No, l like to go back to
Raintree County

992
01:12:43,839 --> 01:12:44,965
But why?

993
01:12:45,041 --> 01:12:46,338
We've plenty of money

994
01:12:46,409 --> 01:12:48,001
Honey, l---l got to get a job---

995
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:49,543
l got to work

996
01:12:49,845 --> 01:12:51,710
That's why we should be back home---

997
01:12:51,781 --> 01:12:53,976
so the 2 of you can be resting

998
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:03,617
Johnny, l haven't been very honest
with you

999
01:13:03,959 --> 01:13:05,620
You haven't?

1000
01:13:08,831 --> 01:13:13,359
When l told you l was going to have
a baby, l lied

1001
01:13:15,104 --> 01:13:17,698
l'm not going to have a baby

1002
01:13:21,377 --> 01:13:24,813
l lied because l wanted you more than

1003
01:13:24,914 --> 01:13:27,849
anything l ever wanted in my life

1004
01:13:28,684 --> 01:13:32,620
Because l---somehow l just---

1005
01:13:34,423 --> 01:13:36,516
0h, l don't know

1006
01:13:39,395 --> 01:13:42,660
Darling, one thing you must understand---

1007
01:13:42,765 --> 01:13:45,666
l love you very much

1008
01:13:46,669 --> 01:13:49,194
You'd never leave me, wouldn't you---
Johnny?

1009
01:13:49,472 --> 01:13:52,236
Hm ---l'll never leave you

1010
01:13:52,341 --> 01:14:01,181
l love you---let's go home

1011
01:14:01,684 --> 01:14:05,347
0h, yes---Johnny

1012
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:22,096
Well, Miss Nell Kader---shame on you

1013
01:14:22,171 --> 01:14:26,039
While here my husband and l have been
home settled this time

1014
01:14:26,075 --> 01:14:30,409
you have yet to call on us
with your prettiest escape

1015
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:32,746
l leave the breeding to you

1016
01:14:33,849 --> 01:14:36,818
How do you like here in
Raintree County?

1017
01:14:37,253 --> 01:14:41,155
Well, l hardly feel this town
so small anymore

1018
01:14:41,257 --> 01:14:43,725
Whatever you do for the day?

1019
01:14:43,826 --> 01:14:45,657
l take walks

1020
01:14:45,728 --> 01:14:46,922
How really?

1021
01:14:46,996 --> 01:14:48,725
You tell me who you walk with

1022
01:14:48,831 --> 01:14:51,800
l'm interested in all aspects
of real life

1023
01:14:51,901 --> 01:14:55,428
You won't be interested in me---
l walk alone

1024
01:14:56,105 --> 01:14:58,596
l just don't understand here

1025
01:14:58,707 --> 01:15:00,572
You're still young, you know---

1026
01:15:00,643 --> 01:15:03,305
and pretty as a swan

1027
01:15:03,412 --> 01:15:05,710
Are you interested in man?

1028
01:15:06,015 --> 01:15:07,175
Perhaps

1029
01:15:07,283 --> 01:15:10,912
Well, good---l just talked to you
like a school teacher---

1030
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:12,317
like Johnny

1031
01:15:12,721 --> 01:15:13,745
You know, Miss Kader---

1032
01:15:13,823 --> 01:15:16,690
a school teacher
almost has remote little habits

1033
01:15:16,759 --> 01:15:21,219
like read and write and mess around
in the classroom

1034
01:15:21,764 --> 01:15:25,291
Anyway, l did want you to know
you're always welcome

1035
01:15:25,501 --> 01:15:28,834
Any friend of my husband's is
a friend of mine

1036
01:15:28,938 --> 01:15:33,272
And Johnny always did tell me
all his best friends in Raintree County

1037
01:15:33,375 --> 01:15:37,243
You're the best---goodbye

1038
01:16:05,107 --> 01:16:06,734
Hello, Johnny

1039
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:12,946
0h, where you pop up from?

1040
01:16:13,148 --> 01:16:14,843
No place special

1041
01:16:40,476 --> 01:16:42,171
Galwood asked me to marry him

1042
01:16:42,244 --> 01:16:44,144
Mr. Seanacy---

1043
01:16:44,246 --> 01:16:45,270
Hello

1044
01:16:47,383 --> 01:16:55,586
He's going to politics---
what do you think, Johnny?

1045
01:16:55,958 --> 01:17:00,395
l mean you're always---
being my best friend

1046
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:05,357
l think Galwood will make
a fine politician

1047
01:17:08,103 --> 01:17:10,435
You know that's not what l mean

1048
01:17:19,315 --> 01:17:23,479
Mr. Seanacy---a few months in your class

1049
01:17:23,552 --> 01:17:24,985
l learned more about poetry and

1050
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:30,117
politics and life and---
that l've all the time going to school

1051
01:17:34,964 --> 01:17:38,365
The students seem to enjoy
creeping up on me

1052
01:17:39,668 --> 01:17:41,568
They're all in love with you

1053
01:17:41,937 --> 01:17:46,636
Teachers get falling in love with
is not occupation, right?

1054
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:49,741
Me was different---

1055
01:17:49,845 --> 01:17:52,678
l fell in love with the student

1056
01:17:53,716 --> 01:17:55,308
So did l

1057
01:17:59,788 --> 01:18:02,882
All l thought was a mistake, wasn't it?

1058
01:18:05,828 --> 01:18:08,023
She tricked you into marriage, Johnny---

1059
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:09,222
she wasn't pregnant

1060
01:18:09,331 --> 01:18:13,529
lt's one thing people around here
can't do without denial

1061
01:18:16,305 --> 01:18:19,103
l'm sorry, Johnny---l'm so ugly

1062
01:18:20,309 --> 01:18:25,975
No, Susana and l are going to have
a baby in April

1063
01:18:26,682 --> 01:18:29,207
l want you to know you're my
best friend

1064
01:18:35,324 --> 01:18:47,998
Well, l'm very happy for both of you---
until then, goodbye

1065
01:19:34,716 --> 01:19:36,650
How do you feel?

1066
01:19:37,319 --> 01:19:43,258
0h, l've trouble to sleep again---
that dream ---

1067
01:19:45,894 --> 01:19:48,192
Why you got up so early?

1068
01:19:48,363 --> 01:19:50,957
Doesn't it school election day?

1069
01:19:51,066 --> 01:19:52,397
l got to vote

1070
01:19:52,868 --> 01:19:59,398
You were out so late last night---
speech---Lincoln?

1071
01:19:59,608 --> 01:20:01,667
l wasn't the only one up there

1072
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:03,074
The speech was fine

1073
01:20:03,145 --> 01:20:06,342
Thank God when Jones delivered it wise

1074
01:20:06,715 --> 01:20:08,205
You want to read it?

1075
01:20:09,051 --> 01:20:10,279
Come in

1076
01:20:12,087 --> 01:20:14,351
Morning---Mr. and Mrs. Seanacy

1077
01:20:14,456 --> 01:20:16,151
Good morning, Siona

1078
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:21,058
Galwood Vs Jones---

1079
01:20:21,563 --> 01:20:24,532
l always wonder what's the beast for

1080
01:20:25,501 --> 01:20:27,696
l give you one guess

1081
01:20:28,237 --> 01:20:30,228
Galwood Vs Jones---

1082
01:20:30,305 --> 01:20:34,901
Youngest candidate ever to seek office
in lndiana State Legislature last night

1083
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:38,070
rounded up his program campaign
at 3-mile junction

1084
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:43,742
His enthusiastic denunciation of
teachers who used schools as platforms

1085
01:20:43,819 --> 01:20:46,287
to corrupt the youths of
Raintree County---

1086
01:20:46,822 --> 01:20:49,950
Those who stand on slavery question
were most violent that

1087
01:20:50,025 --> 01:20:52,493
Jones declared the best look to

1088
01:20:52,561 --> 01:20:54,256
democracy they only wanted to shit

1089
01:20:54,329 --> 01:20:58,663
A certain young teacher who instructs
the young, inflammatory and seditious

1090
01:20:58,767 --> 01:21:04,034
about the abolition includes a domestic
arrangement of his own home to colored people

1091
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:09,600
The status with respect to freedom whose
protection of abolitionists claims monopoly as---

1092
01:21:09,678 --> 01:21:11,168
Who said who's?

1093
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:13,077
Questionable

1094
01:21:13,148 --> 01:21:15,412
Can you guess who's talking about?

1095
01:21:15,484 --> 01:21:17,349
But l think he's right

1096
01:21:17,452 --> 01:21:20,910
l think politics like charity
should begin at home

1097
01:21:21,490 --> 01:21:24,516
That's exactly what l intend to begin

1098
01:21:25,227 --> 01:21:27,161
What about Daisy and Siona?

1099
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:28,786
What about them?

1100
01:21:28,897 --> 01:21:32,526
Honey, you lied to free those girls
and get rid of them

1101
01:21:32,601 --> 01:21:35,570
But they've been with our family
since they were born

1102
01:21:35,904 --> 01:21:38,202
They'd be unhappy any place else

1103
01:21:39,942 --> 01:21:43,742
l just don't understand you, Johnny---
after having insulted me

1104
01:21:43,812 --> 01:21:45,211
l just don't see how can you go on

1105
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:46,406
being an abolitionist

1106
01:21:46,481 --> 01:21:48,847
Susana, you're not south now---

1107
01:21:48,917 --> 01:21:50,942
you can't have your slaves here

1108
01:21:51,119 --> 01:21:53,883
Johnny, l wish you wouldn't pick on me---

1109
01:21:54,489 --> 01:21:56,616
l don't feel well

1110
01:21:57,125 --> 01:21:58,683
Honey, l'm not picking on you

1111
01:21:58,794 --> 01:22:01,695
l---l just don't want slaves in my house

1112
01:22:03,165 --> 01:22:05,497
Alright, l wish we can get away
from here

1113
01:22:05,567 --> 01:22:07,728
l don't like this place

1114
01:22:07,836 --> 01:22:10,168
l just assume limited as a goat
in the hole

1115
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:13,736
What anybody in the south ever did
to hurt you?

1116
01:22:13,842 --> 01:22:16,003
You know how nice and sweet they were

1117
01:22:16,111 --> 01:22:17,635
and how much they loved it

1118
01:22:17,713 --> 01:22:19,840
Jesus, l just don't see how you can

1119
01:22:19,915 --> 01:22:24,181
support a man like Lincoln---Lincoln

1120
01:22:24,353 --> 01:22:26,548
Why you despised Lincoln so much?

1121
01:22:27,022 --> 01:22:30,321
l mean it---that's well-known fact

1122
01:22:30,459 --> 01:22:32,586
You must've heard about it

1123
01:22:32,661 --> 01:22:34,151
What's about the fact?

1124
01:22:34,696 --> 01:22:38,655
l mean the fact Lincoln has
neggar blood in him

1125
01:22:40,168 --> 01:22:41,567
You don't believe it?

1126
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:43,069
As Galwood or Jones

1127
01:22:43,171 --> 01:22:46,436
Dear, all l ask you just get rid of the girls---

1128
01:22:46,541 --> 01:22:48,441
pay them wages and do whatever you want

1129
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:52,412
You don't love me...
you never did love me

1130
01:22:52,481 --> 01:22:55,041
You hate me because l'm southern

1131
01:23:02,457 --> 01:23:06,120
You've been asking questions about me

1132
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:09,624
Dear, do what you want

1133
01:23:09,731 --> 01:23:12,199
But if those girls are not free by tonight,

1134
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:15,328
l won't come back to this house

1135
01:23:59,793 --> 01:24:00,782
Hello, Johnny

1136
01:24:00,894 --> 01:24:01,417
Hello

1137
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:02,985
ls it a wonderful victory?

1138
01:24:03,063 --> 01:24:04,963
You mean Galwood or Lincoln?

1139
01:24:05,298 --> 01:24:08,028
l haven't thought Galwood around here

1140
01:24:08,268 --> 01:24:12,204
You know sometimes being sick of people
is just afraid of people

1141
01:24:12,305 --> 01:24:14,603
You were so wrong with what you said
about Galwood

1142
01:24:14,674 --> 01:24:17,472
l think Galwood would make
a terrible politician

1143
01:24:17,544 --> 01:24:22,379
He was born in the year of 1835
with a little capital he built in 1860

1144
01:24:23,884 --> 01:24:25,408
That's funny

1145
01:24:25,485 --> 01:24:28,579
l also think he'd make
a terrible husband

1146
01:24:35,262 --> 01:24:37,457
How's he with you now?

1147
01:24:37,964 --> 01:24:39,556
Just fine

1148
01:24:40,066 --> 01:24:41,397
Good

1149
01:24:43,103 --> 01:24:46,698
Now you look---you look older

1150
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,467
l'm older

1151
01:24:50,443 --> 01:24:52,536
How's everything with you?

1152
01:24:52,746 --> 01:24:54,611
Fine---

1153
01:24:55,148 --> 01:24:56,706
Good

1154
01:24:57,284 --> 01:25:02,017
Well, l guess it's good time ready
to say goodbye

1155
01:25:02,556 --> 01:25:03,921
Say what?

1156
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:06,089
Say goodbye

1157
01:25:06,626 --> 01:25:07,388
Goodbye?

1158
01:25:07,494 --> 01:25:08,620
Hm ---

1159
01:25:08,728 --> 01:25:10,821
l'm going to lndianapolis

1160
01:25:10,931 --> 01:25:13,991
to live with my---my sister

1161
01:25:14,334 --> 01:25:19,169
l'm sorry---l mean l'm sorry
to hear you go

1162
01:26:01,214 --> 01:26:02,943
Goodnight, Johnny

1163
01:26:06,353 --> 01:26:07,945
Goodnight

1164
01:26:35,248 --> 01:26:39,582
Surprise---hello, our host Johnny boy

1165
01:26:39,653 --> 01:26:43,145
Johnny---it's for you, honey

1166
01:26:43,223 --> 01:26:45,214
lt's a party for you---

1167
01:26:45,292 --> 01:26:46,782
Galwood helped me do it

1168
01:26:46,893 --> 01:26:47,621
Dear---

1169
01:26:47,727 --> 01:26:48,887
A drink, Johnny?

1170
01:26:49,262 --> 01:26:50,058
Thank you, no

1171
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:51,358
0h, come on, pal---

1172
01:26:51,464 --> 01:26:52,931
l made this punch myself---

1173
01:26:52,966 --> 01:26:57,164
old lndian recipe---pure corn and
a little bit of lime

1174
01:26:57,537 --> 01:27:01,234
0h, aren't you gonna congratulate me
on the personal triumph

1175
01:27:01,308 --> 01:27:03,139
for my stand on slavery?

1176
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:04,803
You don't stand, Galwood

1177
01:27:04,911 --> 01:27:09,575
You point like a bird
set upon opportunity

1178
01:27:09,649 --> 01:27:12,880
Well, to you l'll turn any shoe

1179
01:27:12,953 --> 01:27:14,853
l admire your humility

1180
01:27:15,221 --> 01:27:16,483
Darling

1181
01:27:17,223 --> 01:27:21,319
Quiet, everybody---
l've an announcement to make

1182
01:27:21,661 --> 01:27:24,892
Daisy, Siona---come here

1183
01:27:24,965 --> 01:27:28,628
That's a wicked speech, Galwood---
l'm ashamed of you

1184
01:27:29,169 --> 01:27:30,261
Don't miss that, honey

1185
01:27:30,337 --> 01:27:34,171
l'd slap my own grandma better than
the abolition of the poll

1186
01:27:36,142 --> 01:27:37,769
Quiet, everybody---

1187
01:27:38,178 --> 01:27:41,079
l---l want you all to know

1188
01:27:41,147 --> 01:27:44,139
l don't keep any slaves in this house

1189
01:27:44,651 --> 01:27:46,949
ln order to support Mr. Lincoln's election,

1190
01:27:47,020 --> 01:27:49,045
l'll free both these girls

1191
01:27:49,122 --> 01:27:51,852
From now on, they'll work for me
for wages

1192
01:27:53,159 --> 01:27:57,425
Now we've all sisters under the skin

1193
01:28:23,023 --> 01:28:23,751
Siona---

1194
01:28:23,823 --> 01:28:26,451
Mr. Seanacy, we'll look after
your guests

1195
01:28:43,376 --> 01:28:45,241
Honey

1196
01:28:45,478 --> 01:28:48,003
What are you doing---?

1197
01:28:48,915 --> 01:28:51,907
Now you find me, Johnny

1198
01:28:52,018 --> 01:28:55,977
Go on beat me---hurt me

1199
01:28:59,492 --> 01:29:03,053
You're too good for me, Johnny

1200
01:29:03,363 --> 01:29:04,421
Honey

1201
01:29:04,497 --> 01:29:07,125
0h, Johnny---

1202
01:29:08,268 --> 01:29:11,431
What---what did l do wrong?

1203
01:29:11,538 --> 01:29:14,507
You didn't do anything wrong, honey

1204
01:29:16,776 --> 01:29:23,011
l love you, Johnny

1205
01:29:23,116 --> 01:29:25,243
l can do anything for you

1206
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:27,786
l love you, Johnny

1207
01:29:29,089 --> 01:29:31,489
You know---you know what?

1208
01:29:32,192 --> 01:29:35,684
Why don't we just start up
getting rid of these damn dolls?

1209
01:29:43,103 --> 01:29:48,131
Yes, Johnny---yes

1210
01:30:16,369 --> 01:30:18,200
You too, honey

1211
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:21,666
Ah---

1212
01:30:24,244 --> 01:30:29,079
Now, maybe we have a little privacy
around here

1213
01:31:48,328 --> 01:31:49,761
Dear

1214
01:31:54,234 --> 01:31:56,862
Where's that doll?

1215
01:32:00,540 --> 01:32:01,507
Go to bed

1216
01:32:01,608 --> 01:32:03,075
No

1217
01:32:03,543 --> 01:32:11,314
No, l must find it---
l came up here to find it

1218
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:17,483
You don't remember we got rid of
the dolls long time ago?

1219
01:32:23,796 --> 01:32:25,457
Come on

1220
01:32:50,223 --> 01:32:51,713
What's the matter?

1221
01:32:51,824 --> 01:32:53,792
What's the matter, darling?

1222
01:32:54,527 --> 01:32:56,256
0h, what's wrong?

1223
01:32:58,498 --> 01:33:02,093
l keep having awful dreams

1224
01:33:02,735 --> 01:33:09,231
The fire---Johnny, l'm scared

1225
01:33:09,309 --> 01:33:13,370
Susana, get some sleep, okay?

1226
01:33:46,746 --> 01:33:47,872
0h, Johnny

1227
01:33:47,947 --> 01:33:48,709
What's wrong?

1228
01:33:48,781 --> 01:33:49,406
What's the matter?

1229
01:33:49,482 --> 01:33:52,212
Wrong---l hate it come

1230
01:33:52,318 --> 01:33:54,582
Don't worry

1231
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:56,019
l'm going---l'll be right back

1232
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:59,547
lt hurts

1233
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:01,621
l'll be right back

1234
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,719
Hurry

1235
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:19,300
Mom, it happened---can you come over?

1236
01:34:19,379 --> 01:34:19,845
Yes

1237
01:34:19,879 --> 01:34:20,470
Can you come right over?

1238
01:34:20,546 --> 01:34:23,413
0f course, Johnny---
now you pick a bad day

1239
01:34:23,483 --> 01:34:24,245
What's going on here?

1240
01:34:24,317 --> 01:34:25,284
You haven't heard?

1241
01:34:25,318 --> 01:34:26,410
They've attacked on us

1242
01:34:26,486 --> 01:34:28,010
That's for sure anything

1243
01:34:28,087 --> 01:34:29,054
l'm not so sure

1244
01:34:29,122 --> 01:34:31,590
Now say the Americans will never fight
each other

1245
01:34:31,691 --> 01:34:33,716
We'll settle our difficulties
peacefully

1246
01:34:33,793 --> 01:34:34,760
You mean right over?

1247
01:34:34,827 --> 01:34:35,691
Yes, Johnny baby---

1248
01:34:35,762 --> 01:34:36,751
come on

1249
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:40,459
Every red-blooded boy in
Raintree County got into the fight

1250
01:34:40,566 --> 01:34:41,726
I'll be pig tide, hog tide---

1251
01:34:41,834 --> 01:34:44,234
Skined and stretched on the border---
Jack Seanacy

1252
01:34:44,337 --> 01:34:44,962
Flash?

1253
01:34:45,037 --> 01:34:45,696
Good to see you

1254
01:34:45,738 --> 01:34:46,329
How are you?

1255
01:34:46,372 --> 01:34:46,838
Fine

1256
01:34:46,906 --> 01:34:49,807
Corporal, we want get in the war

1257
01:34:49,876 --> 01:34:53,141
You want get in the army, the first
thing you'll do is disarm

1258
01:34:53,212 --> 01:34:55,077
Look, you jerk---
if you look me the same right,

1259
01:34:55,181 --> 01:34:56,671
will you write me down now?

1260
01:34:56,749 --> 01:34:58,273
I'll run and get a pencil

1261
01:34:58,351 --> 01:35:00,216
Wear a blue suit like that with a
couple of rifles,

1262
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:01,047
l look like somebody

1263
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:06,080
Flash---Susana is having a baby right now

1264
01:35:07,226 --> 01:35:09,160
Well, is that so?

1265
01:35:09,529 --> 01:35:10,461
Don't you worry, Jack

1266
01:35:10,596 --> 01:35:11,722
With me at this war, it'd be over

1267
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:12,957
with your kid house broke

1268
01:35:13,032 --> 01:35:16,297
Your boy has had same guts as we had
back to 1846

1269
01:35:16,369 --> 01:35:19,702
You got to taste the Gulf of Mexico
by July 4, huh?

1270
01:35:19,772 --> 01:35:20,431
Right

1271
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:23,031
l don't know everyone talks juice and
vinegar of this war

1272
01:35:23,142 --> 01:35:24,609
All we've done is lost for something

1273
01:35:24,677 --> 01:35:26,144
That's for Raintree County

1274
01:35:26,245 --> 01:35:28,440
Just the same, war is---

1275
01:35:28,514 --> 01:35:31,642
war is the most
monstrous thing to man's solution

1276
01:35:31,717 --> 01:35:34,914
Anything idea worth anything isn't
worth fighting for

1277
01:35:34,954 --> 01:35:39,254
Mr. Seanacy, your Mom said
you can go in now

1278
01:35:42,562 --> 01:35:44,223
Fastest man in Raintree County

1279
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:45,820
Hm ---

1280
01:35:56,442 --> 01:35:58,342
Hello

1281
01:36:12,191 --> 01:36:14,159
lt's a boy

1282
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:16,685
Yeah, it's a boy

1283
01:36:22,802 --> 01:36:24,793
Where was the other, Johnny?

1284
01:36:24,904 --> 01:36:26,166
What?

1285
01:36:26,339 --> 01:36:32,471
There's another---it isn't right

1286
01:36:32,912 --> 01:36:34,436
Dear, just your imagination

1287
01:36:34,547 --> 01:36:40,543
No, there was another---one with that doll

1288
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:43,379
Did they throw it away, Johnny?

1289
01:36:43,489 --> 01:36:44,979
No, dear

1290
01:36:48,194 --> 01:36:49,786
Are you absolutely sure?

1291
01:36:49,862 --> 01:36:51,625
Absolutely

1292
01:36:55,968 --> 01:37:00,166
Dear, do get some sleep

1293
01:37:15,955 --> 01:37:17,354
Johnny

1294
01:37:17,557 --> 01:37:18,888
What?

1295
01:37:19,525 --> 01:37:21,959
I don't want you to go

1296
01:37:22,328 --> 01:37:24,057
I'll be right here

1297
01:37:24,230 --> 01:37:26,562
You won't go, will you?

1298
01:37:27,066 --> 01:37:28,328
Where do I go?

1299
01:37:28,467 --> 01:37:30,594
You won't go to the war?

1300
01:37:31,304 --> 01:37:33,704
You won't go to the war

1301
01:37:36,742 --> 01:37:39,108
No, dear---I won't go to war

1302
01:37:58,631 --> 01:38:00,565
GRANT BESlEGES VlCKSBURG

1303
01:38:00,733 --> 01:38:03,702
SEIGE 0F VICKSBURG ENTERS 35TH DAY

1304
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:10,004
He'll make a runner like his Paw

1305
01:38:10,576 --> 01:38:15,309
Well, another little town will be made
reluctantly immortal by bloodshed

1306
01:38:16,649 --> 01:38:18,981
I got to have another bottle of whisky
with your father

1307
01:38:19,085 --> 01:38:22,020
To remove from battle seems to settle
my stomach

1308
01:38:22,121 --> 01:38:23,418
What did you have for your dinner?

1309
01:38:23,522 --> 01:38:24,853
No, it's the disease---

1310
01:38:24,957 --> 01:38:27,448
the disease is called ‘Civilian Paralysis'

1311
01:38:27,793 --> 01:38:30,956
l know---l guess l must be the only

1312
01:38:31,063 --> 01:38:33,258
civilian under 40 in the whole county

1313
01:38:33,366 --> 01:38:34,958
You got good reason, Johnny

1314
01:38:35,434 --> 01:38:36,458
I wonder

1315
01:38:36,636 --> 01:38:37,728
There're those you don't

1316
01:38:37,837 --> 01:38:41,170
Galwood would beat for good by
Syd Jones for instance

1317
01:38:41,240 --> 01:38:44,038
0h, he's a big man in the State Council

1318
01:38:44,510 --> 01:38:45,909
Maybe he could do better now

1319
01:38:45,978 --> 01:38:48,378
A hundred thousand happy boys have died

1320
01:38:48,447 --> 01:38:50,438
They couldn't spare me either

1321
01:38:50,549 --> 01:38:52,278
Galwood is a copper-head

1322
01:38:52,351 --> 01:38:54,080
Daddy, what's copper-head?

1323
01:38:54,587 --> 01:38:56,748
Well, l'll tell you later

1324
01:38:57,056 --> 01:38:58,717
How's your wife, Johnny?

1325
01:38:59,158 --> 01:39:01,285
She's alright

1326
01:39:03,262 --> 01:39:04,024
Hey

1327
01:39:04,130 --> 01:39:04,755
Hello, Johnny

1328
01:39:04,864 --> 01:39:06,456
This girl is jewel

1329
01:39:06,565 --> 01:39:07,429
She is

1330
01:39:07,533 --> 01:39:09,501
lt's something about a few years
in a big city

1331
01:39:09,568 --> 01:39:12,002
She left here a school girl
for sweetness in life

1332
01:39:12,071 --> 01:39:16,098
She returned a full-pledged newspaper
woman for justice in the crowd

1333
01:39:16,175 --> 01:39:18,109
Come on now---let's get back to work

1334
01:39:18,210 --> 01:39:22,670
Nell, how does it feel being back here
and free able?

1335
01:39:23,149 --> 01:39:25,208
Hm ---l like here better than lndianapolis---

1336
01:39:25,284 --> 01:39:26,876
it's a copper-head town

1337
01:39:26,986 --> 01:39:28,954
Daddy, what's copper-head?

1338
01:39:29,722 --> 01:39:32,953
Well, a copper-head is someone
who lives in the north

1339
01:39:33,059 --> 01:39:35,823
but sides with people living
in the south

1340
01:39:36,429 --> 01:39:42,493
You're still teaching---
still searching for the raintree?

1341
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:47,262
That seems a long time ago, doesn't it?

1342
01:39:48,307 --> 01:39:51,037
You still think there's raintree
out there somewhere?

1343
01:39:51,343 --> 01:39:52,776
l don't know

1344
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:55,008
Let's go and see?

1345
01:39:56,549 --> 01:39:59,211
Much too paralytic---

1346
01:40:00,252 --> 01:40:02,447
l know why you don't want to
look for it

1347
01:40:02,555 --> 01:40:04,546
You're afraid you'll find it

1348
01:40:10,930 --> 01:40:15,731
0nce upon a time, a war long time ago---

1349
01:40:15,835 --> 01:40:17,427
a little boy---

1350
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:20,937
Daddy, when Mommy would come back?

1351
01:40:21,507 --> 01:40:23,372
l think she'll be back soon

1352
01:40:23,809 --> 01:40:28,508
Anyway, so there was the little boy
and he---

1353
01:40:29,682 --> 01:40:31,479
there's Mommy now

1354
01:40:35,855 --> 01:40:37,686
My darling---

1355
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:39,815
Have you missed me today, Jimmy?

1356
01:40:39,925 --> 01:40:41,950
Have you missed me very much?

1357
01:40:42,027 --> 01:40:43,494
Mommy, l was afraid

1358
01:40:43,596 --> 01:40:48,329
You're afraid for Mommy---
isn't that sweet?

1359
01:40:48,434 --> 01:40:51,369
We don't leave you anymore, darling

1360
01:40:51,437 --> 01:40:54,770
Mommy is home---now you get to sleep

1361
01:40:54,874 --> 01:40:59,243
lt's way to your bed time---
sleep on luck, good boy

1362
01:41:01,981 --> 01:41:03,505
Goodnight, darling

1363
01:41:05,651 --> 01:41:07,585
Goodnight, Jimmy

1364
01:41:23,736 --> 01:41:25,567
Where were you all day?

1365
01:41:26,205 --> 01:41:29,538
Now Johnny, you know very well
where l was

1366
01:41:29,742 --> 01:41:30,868
l do?

1367
01:41:31,177 --> 01:41:33,407
l was in lndianapolis

1368
01:41:33,512 --> 01:41:35,002
lndianapolis?

1369
01:41:35,347 --> 01:41:38,111
As l very said on my note,

1370
01:41:38,217 --> 01:41:40,651
l just went there a few hours for shopping

1371
01:41:40,786 --> 01:41:41,912
What note?

1372
01:41:42,655 --> 01:41:45,146
Here---at the dress up

1373
01:41:46,525 --> 01:41:48,823
That's it---you see?

1374
01:42:05,711 --> 01:42:08,145
l can't find it, dear

1375
01:42:08,247 --> 01:42:10,772
l can't find the letter

1376
01:42:11,584 --> 01:42:15,042
But l put it there, you know

1377
01:42:15,187 --> 01:42:17,781
Don't worry, dear---
it really doesn't matter

1378
01:42:22,194 --> 01:42:27,962
You don't think they took it, do you?

1379
01:42:29,168 --> 01:42:31,534
0h, l must find it before it's too late

1380
01:42:31,904 --> 01:42:33,565
Why don't you find it tomorrow morning?

1381
01:42:33,672 --> 01:42:36,004
No, if l not find it now---

1382
01:42:36,108 --> 01:42:37,598
What did you have written on it?

1383
01:42:41,146 --> 01:42:44,274
Well, l---l wouldn't tell you---

1384
01:42:45,117 --> 01:42:47,415
l've promised not to

1385
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:51,654
You believe me, don't you?

1386
01:42:51,790 --> 01:42:53,280
Yes, l do

1387
01:42:57,663 --> 01:43:02,862
You see, l have a great loss---

1388
01:43:07,606 --> 01:43:20,542
dearest thing in the whole world---

1389
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:22,353
Daddy

1390
01:43:23,088 --> 01:43:25,784
Jimmy, my precious little Jimmy

1391
01:43:25,925 --> 01:43:27,688
Daddy---

1392
01:43:27,793 --> 01:43:28,555
Alright

1393
01:43:28,661 --> 01:43:30,128
What are you doing?

1394
01:43:30,229 --> 01:43:32,697
lt's the house, don't you see?

1395
01:43:32,798 --> 01:43:35,392
Something terrible might happen to him

1396
01:43:35,501 --> 01:43:36,365
What do you mean ‘something' ?

1397
01:43:36,435 --> 01:43:38,494
Nothing gonna happen to him ---you crazy?

1398
01:44:31,390 --> 01:44:33,449
l'm sorry, Susana

1399
01:44:37,262 --> 01:44:39,560
Jimmy doesn't like me

1400
01:44:40,032 --> 01:44:41,556
He loves you

1401
01:44:41,900 --> 01:44:44,733
You can't expect him to understand
everything

1402
01:44:45,904 --> 01:44:49,135
l don't understand either

1403
01:44:50,142 --> 01:44:56,604
l thought children were supposed to
create a boundary between parents

1404
01:44:59,151 --> 01:45:02,052
l think Jimmy has created
a great barrier

1405
01:45:02,521 --> 01:45:04,079
That's not true

1406
01:45:04,223 --> 01:45:09,752
Yes, it is, you 2 belong together---

1407
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:13,428
you gonna part from me

1408
01:45:13,599 --> 01:45:15,590
l don't think so

1409
01:45:19,371 --> 01:45:23,501
0h, l wish only something l could do---

1410
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:28,137
l gonna have something---

1411
01:45:29,248 --> 01:45:31,614
Dear, maybe you tell me

1412
01:45:31,717 --> 01:45:33,776
what happened the night of the fire

1413
01:45:37,022 --> 01:45:40,185
lt makes no different now---

1414
01:45:40,325 --> 01:45:42,520
don't you see, Johnny?

1415
01:45:44,496 --> 01:45:48,023
Things can't get better between us

1416
01:45:50,469 --> 01:45:58,240
lt's nobody's fault---
but it's such a pity

1417
01:46:01,146 --> 01:46:07,107
0h, Johnny, help me---help me---

1418
01:46:07,252 --> 01:46:09,413
you always help me

1419
01:46:09,521 --> 01:46:11,580
What can l do?

1420
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:14,049
What happened that night?

1421
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:21,755
l know something about that fire---

1422
01:46:22,401 --> 01:46:24,699
nobody else knows

1423
01:46:26,371 --> 01:46:28,931
l never told anyone

1424
01:46:34,313 --> 01:46:40,513
lt started not long before the fire
when Henrietta had been away

1425
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:44,483
l was very excited the night
when she came back

1426
01:46:45,424 --> 01:46:48,689
l laid in the big house---
l couldn't sleep

1427
01:46:49,428 --> 01:46:52,864
l wanted my doll Jimmy, you know

1428
01:46:52,931 --> 01:46:57,129
And l remembered it left
in Henrietta's cabin

1429
01:46:58,770 --> 01:47:00,931
The house was so still that

1430
01:47:01,039 --> 01:47:03,564
l crabbed downstairs and went outside

1431
01:47:04,276 --> 01:47:07,245
The front door of the cabin was locked

1432
01:47:07,346 --> 01:47:10,179
So l went round to slip in
by the back door

1433
01:47:11,316 --> 01:47:14,615
lt was all dark inside the cabin

1434
01:47:15,587 --> 01:47:17,919
l listened---l couldn't hear anything

1435
01:47:18,023 --> 01:47:19,888
l crabbed to the stairs

1436
01:47:20,692 --> 01:47:25,095
l peeped up over the lamp
above the cabin

1437
01:47:25,197 --> 01:47:28,360
There were 2 people in the room
together

1438
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:31,225
So l had the notion of what was like

1439
01:47:31,336 --> 01:47:33,429
between Daddy and Henrietta

1440
01:47:33,739 --> 01:47:35,604
l loved them both---

1441
01:47:35,674 --> 01:47:39,007
there was nothing
l'd have done for one of them

1442
01:47:39,811 --> 01:47:43,804
ln a few days Henrietta came up
to live in the house

1443
01:47:45,951 --> 01:47:50,115
There was my Mom who was so violent

1444
01:47:51,490 --> 01:47:53,651
0ne day when Daddy was away,

1445
01:47:54,927 --> 01:47:58,385
Mom came
down to find me in Henrietta's room

1446
01:47:59,731 --> 01:48:01,824
There was a terrible thing

1447
01:48:02,234 --> 01:48:05,431
She said awful things to me and---

1448
01:48:08,040 --> 01:48:14,343
all the time Henrietta just stood there

1449
01:48:15,881 --> 01:48:18,679
with her arms around me

1450
01:48:22,621 --> 01:48:25,351
So, that's why l hated Mama

1451
01:48:25,457 --> 01:48:27,391
l wanted to hurt her

1452
01:48:27,926 --> 01:48:30,451
l've been reading a book about

1453
01:48:30,562 --> 01:48:32,655
a person who wanted to hurt another person

1454
01:48:32,764 --> 01:48:33,594
He wrote him a letter---

1455
01:48:33,699 --> 01:48:34,927
but he didn't sign it

1456
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:38,765
So l wrote a letter and left it in
Mama's picture album

1457
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:40,838
which she was always looking through

1458
01:48:43,976 --> 01:48:48,310
lt was---it was just a little note

1459
01:48:48,447 --> 01:48:54,682
lt said ‘Daddy loves Henrietta..-

1460
01:48:55,854 --> 01:48:58,948
Yours truly well-meaning friend'

1461
01:49:02,027 --> 01:49:05,827
A well-meaning friend---l signed it

1462
01:49:07,266 --> 01:49:09,996
Was that silly?

1463
01:49:15,907 --> 01:49:18,933
That night l was in bed with Henrietta

1464
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:23,481
lt must be very late when l found
l got to sleep

1465
01:49:24,283 --> 01:49:28,549
Suddenly l heard something like
fire-crackers

1466
01:49:28,654 --> 01:49:32,715
so soft and mouthful through next room ---

1467
01:49:32,824 --> 01:49:34,052
Henrietta's room

1468
01:49:34,126 --> 01:49:36,287
l guessed l must go in bed to sleep

1469
01:49:38,363 --> 01:49:39,955
because the next thing l knew l---

1470
01:49:40,032 --> 01:49:42,023
l woke up coughing

1471
01:49:42,134 --> 01:49:47,731
The room was terribly hot and
there was a cracking sound and

1472
01:49:48,507 --> 01:49:51,567
my dolls were on fire

1473
01:49:51,677 --> 01:49:54,840
l tried to beat the fire
out of my dolls

1474
01:49:54,946 --> 01:49:57,414
l began to scream

1475
01:49:58,317 --> 01:50:01,377
George---one of our neggars came through
the window

1476
01:50:02,054 --> 01:50:04,921
and wrapped me up over the blanket

1477
01:50:05,023 --> 01:50:11,258
lt's somehow---it's somehow l could
hardly yap

1478
01:50:11,363 --> 01:50:16,801
They said ‘You still have dolls'

1479
01:50:24,476 --> 01:50:27,775
They sent to stay with my aunt

1480
01:50:28,547 --> 01:50:30,139
lt was until quite a while after this

1481
01:50:30,248 --> 01:50:33,775
she told me about Daddy,
Henrietta and Mom

1482
01:50:35,687 --> 01:50:41,182
Finally she brought me to Georgia
and here---

1483
01:50:41,426 --> 01:50:44,520
Did you tell her about the
fire-crackers?

1484
01:50:45,230 --> 01:50:50,429
l told her, but she said to me not to
tell anything about it to anyone

1485
01:50:52,170 --> 01:50:53,831
But l didn't tell her about the note

1486
01:50:53,939 --> 01:50:56,066
l left in Mama's picture album because l thought

1487
01:50:57,042 --> 01:50:59,567
because l thought l---

1488
01:50:59,978 --> 01:51:03,812
maybe l caused her to do this some way---

1489
01:51:05,650 --> 01:51:07,743
Then l cried and cried,

1490
01:51:07,853 --> 01:51:10,651
but no one knew
what l was crying about

1491
01:51:11,857 --> 01:51:14,018
They thought it was about the fire---

1492
01:51:15,894 --> 01:51:17,623
but it wasn't just that

1493
01:51:17,696 --> 01:51:19,493
What was it?

1494
01:51:20,465 --> 01:51:23,559
She killed them ---she killed them and

1495
01:51:23,702 --> 01:51:25,033
l hated her

1496
01:51:25,103 --> 01:51:29,972
l still hate her and
l hate myself for what l did

1497
01:51:30,108 --> 01:51:31,700
You didn't do anything, my dear---

1498
01:51:31,810 --> 01:51:33,038
you didn't do anything

1499
01:51:33,111 --> 01:51:43,009

Mom, hello

1507
01:52:08,914 --> 01:52:10,108
You see this?

1508
01:52:10,248 --> 01:52:12,944
Rivals invade Pennsylvania

1509
01:52:13,585 --> 01:52:16,645
Johnny, l want to talk to you
about this

1510
01:52:16,755 --> 01:52:18,882
lt looks like there's going to be
a big fight

1511
01:52:19,458 --> 01:52:22,985
lf Lee won this one, we're through

1512
01:52:23,094 --> 01:52:24,618
How's Susana?

1513
01:52:28,900 --> 01:52:30,959
l think she's alright

1514
01:52:33,271 --> 01:52:36,297
Johnny, if you ever need me
or l can help about it---

1515
01:52:36,408 --> 01:52:39,900
Mom, you know you'll be
the first person l'll come to

1516
01:52:45,784 --> 01:52:47,115
Well

1517
01:52:47,486 --> 01:52:48,214
Johnny

1518
01:52:48,320 --> 01:52:49,514
What?

1519
01:52:49,721 --> 01:52:51,450
Nobody is here

1520
01:52:51,556 --> 01:52:53,183
What do you mean ‘Nobody is here' ?

1521
01:52:53,291 --> 01:52:54,986
She is not here

1522
01:53:00,098 --> 01:53:01,429
Susana

1523
01:53:02,033 --> 01:53:03,330
Jimmy

1524
01:53:20,051 --> 01:53:22,986
‘Darling, l've a safe conduct
to cross the lines

1525
01:53:23,121 --> 01:53:25,555
So by the time you read this,

1526
01:53:25,624 --> 01:53:29,458
little Jim and l will be on our way to Georgia

1527
01:53:29,528 --> 01:53:32,395
Don't be alarmed about me---
they can't follow me

1528
01:53:32,497 --> 01:53:34,226
l'm outwitting them this time

1529
01:53:34,332 --> 01:53:36,960
They'll stop at nothing---simply nothing

1530
01:53:37,202 --> 01:53:38,726
Unless l can get away from them ---

1531
01:53:38,870 --> 01:53:40,838
my life is not worth anything

1532
01:53:40,939 --> 01:53:43,066
You understand, don't you, Johnny?

1533
01:53:43,174 --> 01:53:44,903
You understand

1534
01:53:44,976 --> 01:53:47,444
Your loving Susana'

1535
01:53:48,847 --> 01:53:51,839
lf you find her, what good will do?

1536
01:53:52,450 --> 01:53:55,317
lt's all hopeless and useless

1537
01:53:56,588 --> 01:53:58,886
You can find Jim after the war

1538
01:53:59,524 --> 01:54:01,321
But right now what you're doing
is crazy

1539
01:54:01,459 --> 01:54:04,360
That's fool's madness what it was

1540
01:54:05,297 --> 01:54:08,357
l always have the high hope---

1541
01:54:09,401 --> 01:54:11,835
Well, what l mean is you're
such a long-headed boy

1542
01:54:11,937 --> 01:54:13,802
always so full of laughter

1543
01:54:13,872 --> 01:54:17,137
Now, she's drained and left out of you---

1544
01:54:19,844 --> 01:54:21,744
who do you have to do it?

1545
01:54:24,449 --> 01:54:26,679
She's alright, l tell you

1546
01:54:34,626 --> 01:54:38,084
l know why you're doing it---you pity her

1547
01:54:38,697 --> 01:54:41,029
Pap, l love her---

1548
01:54:47,739 --> 01:54:50,139
You take care of yourself, Johnny

1549
01:54:50,642 --> 01:54:51,609
Don't worry, Mom

1550
01:54:51,710 --> 01:54:53,405
l don't think the war will last
any longer

1551
01:54:53,511 --> 01:54:54,944
He'll be back anytime

1552
01:54:55,013 --> 01:54:57,311
l think of hope, kid

1553
01:55:10,595 --> 01:55:12,119
Dear Lord,

1554
01:55:13,031 --> 01:55:17,559
please bring this boy back
safe and---Amen

1555
01:55:18,003 --> 01:55:19,402
l've been with you for lifetime

1556
01:55:19,504 --> 01:55:21,597
l believe this is the shortest prayer
you've ever had

1557
01:55:21,706 --> 01:55:23,936
Board---

1558
01:55:24,509 --> 01:55:25,737
Goodbye

1559
01:55:26,611 --> 01:55:27,942
Goodbye

1560
01:55:28,413 --> 01:55:29,880
Goodbye

1561
01:55:31,816 --> 01:55:33,477
Johnny

1562
01:55:33,718 --> 01:55:35,447
My dear

1563
01:55:37,622 --> 01:55:39,021
Johnny

1564
01:55:40,258 --> 01:55:45,662
Johnny, that's all l can say---
it's Johnny

1565
01:55:46,998 --> 01:55:49,933
lt's fine after all these years in this
town we stopped

1566
01:55:50,035 --> 01:55:51,366
and talked and---

1567
01:55:51,436 --> 01:55:52,835
l never had any trouble talking

1568
01:55:52,971 --> 01:55:54,233
just like it now

1569
01:55:54,572 --> 01:55:56,164
lt's true

1570
01:55:58,109 --> 01:56:00,304
Johnny, just come back safe

1571
01:56:00,612 --> 01:56:02,102
l'll try

1572
01:56:02,313 --> 01:56:03,405
Try hard

1573
01:56:03,948 --> 01:56:07,679
lf anything happened to you, it'd be
the most beautiful murder

1574
01:56:07,819 --> 01:56:10,083
since the beginning of time

1575
01:56:11,423 --> 01:56:13,391
Nothing is gonna happen to me

1576
01:56:13,992 --> 01:56:16,051
lt just can't, Johnny,

1577
01:56:16,728 --> 01:56:17,524
because somehow

1578
01:56:17,595 --> 01:56:19,893
l know we'll find each other again

1579
01:56:19,964 --> 01:56:21,397
l don't know how, but l know that

1580
01:56:21,533 --> 01:56:25,492
l always know that and that's why
l came back here

1581
01:56:26,037 --> 01:56:28,232
l never stop loving you

1582
01:56:28,373 --> 01:56:29,635
When l walked these streets,

1583
01:56:29,708 --> 01:56:33,269
l said this is his town and

1584
01:56:33,378 --> 01:56:35,608
these people are his people

1585
01:56:35,714 --> 01:56:39,150
and this earth is his---his earth

1586
01:56:40,185 --> 01:56:42,346
You just don't know, Johnny

1587
01:57:19,991 --> 01:57:22,221

01:57:23,294 --> 01:57:25,023

Well---while l'll be cousin l'll be squaw

Just start to dance to walk my Jack's
brand new pant

1593
01:57:35,707 --> 01:57:38,005
l've been squashing and rolling loud

1594
01:57:38,109 --> 01:57:38,871
Hey

1595
01:57:38,977 --> 01:57:39,909
l've been looking for you, Jack---

1596
01:57:40,011 --> 01:57:41,911
l see your name on the roll of new crew

1597
01:57:41,980 --> 01:57:43,572
Hey, boys

1598
01:57:44,649 --> 01:57:45,581
Store your kits over there

1599
01:57:45,683 --> 01:57:46,479
There's still space

1600
01:57:46,551 --> 01:57:47,347
That's port for you

1601
01:57:47,418 --> 01:57:52,685
Troopers, l want you to meet my old and
alcoholic drunken body, Jack Seanacy

1602
01:57:52,757 --> 01:57:55,555
Hey, Seanacy---

1603
01:58:04,202 --> 01:58:05,567
Alright---now let's go

1604
01:58:05,703 --> 01:58:06,761
l just got here

1605
01:58:06,838 --> 01:58:07,896
Come on now

1606
01:58:08,006 --> 01:58:10,031
Sorry, l got to report in this soon

01:58:10,108 --> 01:58:11,439
0h, let them find you---
they're pretty good

1608
01:58:11,543 --> 01:58:13,773
And besides, we got things to do and
somebody to meet

1609
01:58:13,845 --> 01:58:15,312
Come on

1610
01:58:15,413 --> 01:58:16,437
Who?

1611
01:58:16,548 --> 01:58:18,482
0h, never mind---let's go

1612
01:58:23,755 --> 01:58:25,620
Hold out, dear boy

1613
01:58:30,662 --> 01:58:32,892
Well---

1614
01:58:33,231 --> 01:58:35,426
Professor

1615
01:58:38,603 --> 01:58:40,264
Well, that was a long train

1616
01:58:40,371 --> 01:58:42,066
How did they set me on, Johnny?

1617
01:58:42,173 --> 01:58:43,299
What are you doing here?

1618
01:58:43,408 --> 01:58:45,740
Well, one battlefield is as dirty
as another

1619
01:58:45,810 --> 01:58:49,007
Where else should l be over the brave
half-yearly throwbacks of

1620
01:58:49,113 --> 01:58:52,048
Raintree County---my kind of people

1621
01:58:52,150 --> 01:58:53,742
Been chased by any towns lately?

1622
01:58:53,852 --> 01:58:56,343
0h---l never stayed long enough, dear boy

1623
01:58:56,721 --> 01:59:00,680
l'm a dear man walker on correspondence
with infinite capacity for being afraid

1624
01:59:01,125 --> 01:59:04,185
Tell me, what's the state scene
in lndiana these days?

1625
01:59:04,329 --> 01:59:05,557
l don't have to go around, l trust

1626
01:59:05,730 --> 01:59:09,496
0h, it's lack and off considerably
since you left

1627
01:59:09,868 --> 01:59:11,460
lt hasn't changed a lot, has it?

1628
01:59:11,569 --> 01:59:13,059
Time passes---

1629
01:59:13,137 --> 01:59:17,506
Deep scar of thunder has trenched me
and cared as on this bearded cheek

1630
01:59:17,609 --> 01:59:19,099
But bearded marks you know too many

1631
01:59:19,210 --> 01:59:20,973
a plant myth City of New York

1632
01:59:21,079 --> 01:59:23,047
0h, you're a freckle professor

1633
01:59:23,147 --> 01:59:24,637
Not at all

1634
01:59:25,450 --> 01:59:28,078
l loved that girl in Raintree County

1635
01:59:28,186 --> 01:59:29,983
He hasn't said this for 2 whole days

1636
01:59:30,054 --> 01:59:31,646
By the way, what was her name?

1637
01:59:31,723 --> 01:59:36,126
Her husband has somehow blacked my---
otherwise in memory

1638
01:59:36,194 --> 01:59:39,925
Lydia Gray---her husband only died
a couple of months ago

1639
01:59:40,298 --> 01:59:42,994
So the great mother finally got her

1640
01:59:43,101 --> 01:59:46,628
in a lukewarm bosom apocalypse, l presume

1641
01:59:47,105 --> 01:59:48,629
Measles, l guess

1642
01:59:48,973 --> 01:59:51,066
So the wit of guess is available

1643
01:59:51,175 --> 01:59:52,699
in case you want to know

1644
01:59:53,878 --> 01:59:57,006
Dear boy, for such romantic dreamer---

1645
01:59:57,115 --> 02:00:00,312
l envy you this simplicity of your concern

1646
02:00:02,687 --> 02:00:04,314
You see there?

1647
02:00:04,923 --> 02:00:05,821
What?

1648
02:00:05,957 --> 02:00:06,616
Those fires over there

1649
02:00:06,724 --> 02:00:07,554
Hm ---

1650
02:00:08,359 --> 02:00:12,193
That one hill behind it---the one behind
are lousy with the rats

1651
02:00:13,264 --> 02:00:15,562
They'll be fighting for sure
in the morning

1652
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:18,395
They look close already

1653
02:00:19,037 --> 02:00:27,137
Ah, the white destroyer---
gun of the arms---a toss

1654
02:00:27,645 --> 02:00:29,875
To all the men who go out and die

1655
02:00:29,981 --> 02:00:31,915
because they have luck to be born

1656
02:00:32,016 --> 02:00:39,013
one side or another of the south
or the north---and here to sleep

1657
02:00:41,292 --> 02:00:44,659
Let's have a goodnight with it
until tomorrow

1658
02:00:44,762 --> 02:00:47,458
Crusaders, you're starting a journey

1659
02:00:48,032 --> 02:00:50,523
to a new and unknown land---

1660
02:00:50,635 --> 02:00:53,160
a place called hell

1661
02:01:01,245 --> 02:01:05,477
Toward---

1662
02:01:15,093 --> 02:01:17,391
September 19, 1863

1663
02:01:18,062 --> 02:01:19,461
Chucamargua

1664
02:01:19,564 --> 02:01:22,965
Reach of majority language means
‘River of Death'

1665
02:02:05,877 --> 02:02:08,402
May 16, 1864

1666
02:02:08,746 --> 02:02:10,077
0saka, Georgia

1667
02:02:10,181 --> 02:02:13,548
Another day of dramatic call is making

1668
02:02:32,303 --> 02:02:33,930
Sniper---

1669
02:03:03,267 --> 02:03:04,564
Canasona Mountain

1670
02:03:04,669 --> 02:03:06,796
June 27, 1864

1671
02:03:06,904 --> 02:03:09,031
The army twisted the railroads to

1672
02:03:09,140 --> 02:03:12,632
something called ‘Southerners Neckties'

1673
02:03:35,266 --> 02:03:36,392
Atlanta

1674
02:03:36,567 --> 02:03:38,797
November 16, 1864

1675
02:03:38,903 --> 02:03:41,701
The first mortar cracked at the south
of summer

1676
02:04:38,396 --> 02:04:42,025
This year our army will cut us off
all major operations

1677
02:04:42,700 --> 02:04:44,292
as it gonna strike straight into

1678
02:04:44,368 --> 02:04:45,995
the heart of the enemy

1679
02:04:46,070 --> 02:04:48,368
And you brothers gonna stick to job and

1680
02:04:48,472 --> 02:04:52,101
your job is next stomach of this war

1681
02:04:52,610 --> 02:04:55,977
You gonna travel the army in front of
the ranks and

1682
02:04:56,080 --> 02:04:59,311
you gonna point the way to provision
of the ranks

1683
02:04:59,383 --> 02:05:02,716
You gonna believe the fact and
lead the land

1684
02:05:02,820 --> 02:05:06,813
You gonna be on your own free and
forget command

1685
02:05:06,924 --> 02:05:08,050
Good

1686
02:05:08,526 --> 02:05:10,426
What's so good about it, north man?

1687
02:05:10,494 --> 02:05:13,224
l always say the general sends us
to our own deaths

1688
02:05:13,297 --> 02:05:14,127
Alright

1689
02:05:14,198 --> 02:05:16,826
Ha---

1690
02:05:16,934 --> 02:05:19,698
Alright, hold your mouth

1691
02:05:20,671 --> 02:05:22,229
Tell me, 0rvil---

1692
02:05:22,306 --> 02:05:24,536
Are you animal, vegetable or mineral?

1693
02:05:24,642 --> 02:05:25,506
What's mineral?

1694
02:05:25,576 --> 02:05:33,950
0h, there's no time to spare---
Johnny , leaving all day

1695
02:05:34,485 --> 02:05:37,079
So you join this play for August, huh?

1696
02:05:37,188 --> 02:05:39,281
Lucas sis the best fighter
in all the world

1697
02:05:39,357 --> 02:05:42,758
The time you're confused in ferocity
with ability

1698
02:05:43,227 --> 02:05:44,785
But never mind, Lucas,

1699
02:05:44,862 --> 02:05:45,851
if you should get squashed

1700
02:05:45,963 --> 02:05:48,659
allowing you with the small
and that's it

1701
02:05:49,066 --> 02:05:52,058
To Johnny Seanacy, it's upset

1702
02:05:52,169 --> 02:05:53,158
Even sleeping,

1703
02:05:53,271 --> 02:05:55,102
l hear him pray for his loving boy

1704
02:05:55,206 --> 02:05:57,674
Professor, go home

1705
02:05:58,309 --> 02:06:00,869
As a matter of fact, l'm going

1706
02:06:01,078 --> 02:06:03,774
l'm going to marry Mrs. Lydia Gray

1707
02:06:03,848 --> 02:06:07,409
Now the chief obstacle in our way
has been removed

1708
02:06:08,052 --> 02:06:11,613
Thinking one day, boy, there're many
a devil as guards of the night

1709
02:06:11,722 --> 02:06:13,553
The home glooms make us always better

1710
02:06:13,658 --> 02:06:14,852
l like it

1711
02:06:14,925 --> 02:06:18,258
l've been a road runner long enough---
so much for me

1712
02:06:18,829 --> 02:06:22,560
But you, l can't follow---
you're with the battles

1713
02:06:22,667 --> 02:06:24,294
We'll be marching to New Georgia---

1714
02:06:24,402 --> 02:06:26,165
we're free of command

1715
02:06:26,270 --> 02:06:27,897
Free of command?

1716
02:06:29,073 --> 02:06:32,236
So this is your way finding Susana
yourself

1717
02:06:33,678 --> 02:06:35,703
Hm ---yes

1718
02:06:36,981 --> 02:06:42,442
Well, toss to the union and the real

1719
02:06:49,393 --> 02:06:52,487
You'll see the country swamp
where is lying seeing volume

1720
02:06:52,630 --> 02:06:54,962
So it's not easy to find us

1721
02:06:55,199 --> 02:06:57,531
There're only ourselves where we are---

1722
02:06:57,635 --> 02:07:00,069
folks of the north all lost in lndiana

1723
02:07:00,171 --> 02:07:04,665
Loss an army of 60,000 men---
please return to the owners---

1724
02:07:04,775 --> 02:07:06,333
sign and label them

1725
02:08:01,766 --> 02:08:03,165
Flash

1726
02:09:14,104 --> 02:09:17,096
Look, a Raintree County out in office

1727
02:09:18,409 --> 02:09:21,139
l entrust myself to the hands
of a gentleman

1728
02:09:21,245 --> 02:09:22,906
Where's your heart?

1729
02:09:24,381 --> 02:09:26,246
Take him over to the house

1730
02:09:29,186 --> 02:09:33,748
When l get caught, that's what comes
my leisure

1731
02:09:33,858 --> 02:09:36,088
Now move---move

1732
02:09:39,029 --> 02:09:40,894
Some ware is this?

1733
02:09:41,799 --> 02:09:46,463
l fought in 6 major engagements---
from Gettysburg to wilderness---

1734
02:09:47,071 --> 02:09:49,039
never been unhorsed

1735
02:09:51,542 --> 02:09:54,102
And then l get caught by 2 bummers

1736
02:09:55,179 --> 02:09:57,477
That's why l came to my leisure

1737
02:09:57,581 --> 02:09:58,639
You're right, Captain---

1738
02:09:58,716 --> 02:10:00,775
l'm ahead to turn you over to the army

1739
02:11:58,268 --> 02:12:00,293
Where's Susana?

1740
02:12:01,639 --> 02:12:04,574
Do you know where Susana is?

1741
02:12:05,342 --> 02:12:07,401
Susana Seanacy

1742
02:12:09,647 --> 02:12:12,445
l'm Johnny Seanacy---l'm her husband

1743
02:12:12,983 --> 02:12:15,349
Do you know where she is?

1744
02:12:17,821 --> 02:12:20,949
Do you know where the boy is?

1745
02:12:27,364 --> 02:12:29,491
l'm gonna find them

1746
02:12:29,633 --> 02:12:32,101
l'm gonna find them

1747
02:12:35,939 --> 02:12:45,143
She---she's gone long time ago

1748
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:54,423
Don't---go her way

1749
02:13:10,574 --> 02:13:12,269
Come on down

1750
02:13:36,133 --> 02:13:37,464
Jimmy?

1751
02:13:38,102 --> 02:13:39,535
Daddy

1752
02:13:40,571 --> 02:13:42,129
Jimmy

1753
02:13:42,272 --> 02:13:42,795
Daddy

1754
02:13:42,873 --> 02:13:44,568
That's my hero

1755
02:13:45,309 --> 02:13:51,839
Jimmy, l don't believe it---
l don't believe it at all

1756
02:14:07,097 --> 02:14:10,589
Captain---when does this war go to end?

1757
02:14:12,703 --> 02:14:15,001
l guess l can't go on much longer

1758
02:14:17,107 --> 02:14:23,273
We'll see---Captain Lee will buy
a long shot

1759
02:14:23,714 --> 02:14:26,547
Suppose all southerners will take
that career, huh?

1760
02:14:26,784 --> 02:14:28,547
Am l right

1761
02:14:28,619 --> 02:14:31,918
when somebody will continue
to fight for his career?

1762
02:14:32,689 --> 02:14:34,657
Jack, l'll tell you the truth

1763
02:14:34,758 --> 02:14:36,749
lt's too sad to know l'd blow
his head off

1764
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:38,521
l never thought if they'd know it

1765
02:14:38,929 --> 02:14:40,954
Now Captain, l didn't

1766
02:14:41,031 --> 02:14:44,262
Mr. Seanacy, where you take Jim?

1767
02:14:45,736 --> 02:14:53,507
Back to my house there---
l'm trying to get him to Dubana

1768
02:14:53,610 --> 02:14:56,204
You'd better go by a close cut with me---

1769
02:14:56,580 --> 02:14:58,844
l'll probably prove myself for

1770
02:14:59,316 --> 02:15:02,979
Probably much better talk to this
asshole donkey

1771
02:15:06,156 --> 02:15:10,650
And the war is over, you gonna get
Miss Susana?

1772
02:15:14,264 --> 02:15:16,095
Yes

1773
02:15:16,834 --> 02:15:18,927
Don't do this, Mr. Seanacy

1774
02:15:19,736 --> 02:15:23,137
l never should have told you
where she was

1775
02:15:25,042 --> 02:15:28,739
You don't know what she was like
when they took her away

1776
02:15:29,446 --> 02:15:30,777
You don't know, Mr. Seanacy---

1777
02:15:30,848 --> 02:15:32,839
she really got sickness

1778
02:15:32,916 --> 02:15:36,613
Nothing---
not all the loving care in this world

1779
02:15:36,687 --> 02:15:38,484
could get rid of it

1780
02:15:38,555 --> 02:15:40,546
l know Miss Susana---

1781
02:15:40,991 --> 02:15:43,459
me and old George upstairs

1782
02:15:43,527 --> 02:15:45,427
He saved her in the fire---

1783
02:15:45,495 --> 02:15:46,894
he carried her through the window

1784
02:15:46,997 --> 02:15:49,966
The smoke in his lungs, he has been
holding it ever since

1785
02:15:50,534 --> 02:15:52,024
And then she got sick

1786
02:15:52,102 --> 02:15:53,729
She talked most strange

1787
02:15:53,804 --> 02:15:56,705
about Henrietta who could be her mother

1788
02:15:56,807 --> 02:15:58,798
She said ovezr and over---

1789
02:15:58,909 --> 02:15:59,967
Where she was?

1790
02:16:00,043 --> 02:16:01,510
You crazy too?

1791
02:16:04,047 --> 02:16:06,675
l delivered Susana

1792
02:16:07,017 --> 02:16:11,545
And from that time on Mrs. Strait
could never take care of her

1793
02:16:11,622 --> 02:16:12,520
So Henrietta had a deal---

1794
02:16:12,589 --> 02:16:14,454
they were always together

1795
02:16:14,558 --> 02:16:17,049
Susana wanted Henrietta
to be her mother

1796
02:16:17,594 --> 02:16:20,188
0nly she hated the idea of democracy

1797
02:16:20,297 --> 02:16:23,994
Henrietta was---just like me

1798
02:16:27,170 --> 02:16:29,900
0nly then l knew what the child was---

1799
02:16:30,440 --> 02:16:33,170
then the war going on inside her

1800
02:16:36,246 --> 02:16:38,180
Alright, let's move

1801
02:16:46,890 --> 02:16:49,017
Thank you, Patsy

1802
02:17:21,491 --> 02:17:22,753
Jack

1803
02:17:23,460 --> 02:17:25,985
l believe he breathes bad

1804
02:17:26,430 --> 02:17:28,227
Let's make it quick

1805
02:18:15,479 --> 02:18:18,448
Flash, are you alright?

1806
02:18:19,783 --> 02:18:20,772
Flash

1807
02:18:20,884 --> 02:18:22,181
Stay where you are

1808
02:18:22,586 --> 02:18:23,848
You hit?

1809
02:18:25,022 --> 02:18:26,489
You need me?

1810
02:18:26,957 --> 02:18:30,654
l'd make it settled, the pitch one

1811
02:18:31,395 --> 02:18:32,862
Stay where you are

1812
02:18:38,435 --> 02:18:40,460
We got to get out of here

1813
02:18:41,104 --> 02:18:42,867
You want me to take the kid?

1814
02:18:43,040 --> 02:18:45,031
No, l'll take care of him

1815
02:18:57,788 --> 02:18:59,881
Don't wait by my side---
you got to race the run

1816
02:18:59,990 --> 02:19:03,391
lt's the only chance for the day---
prefer 2 of us

1817
02:19:06,930 --> 02:19:09,490
Alright, let's go

1818
02:19:25,982 --> 02:19:30,578
Hey you---come out

1819
02:19:32,656 --> 02:19:34,886
What's wrong you, bums?

1820
02:19:38,128 --> 02:19:40,392
Just want to see you still there

1821
02:19:40,530 --> 02:19:42,623
Here you're there?

1822
02:19:44,167 --> 02:19:46,692
Why don't you go and play
somewhere else?

1823
02:19:48,171 --> 02:19:51,072
You keep us out of beauty---sleep---

1824
02:19:51,508 --> 02:19:55,444
We gonna get you a good luck sheep

1825
02:19:59,916 --> 02:20:04,819
Shame it---you shoot that pretty close

1826
02:20:04,988 --> 02:20:10,483
That isn't friendly---you decide to call

1827
02:20:13,497 --> 02:20:15,465
Comer save yourself

1828
02:20:15,799 --> 02:20:21,362
Not just fast---the longer l gonna
save free

1829
02:20:23,974 --> 02:20:28,502
Pal, where are you coming?

1830
02:20:30,714 --> 02:20:32,409
Well, come on

1831
02:20:43,126 --> 02:20:45,651
0h, come on---what are you waiting for?

1832
02:20:49,199 --> 02:21:10,953
l came from Raintree County---
l can look at it---here

1833
02:21:31,341 --> 02:21:34,742
Another glorious victory

1834
02:21:48,158 --> 02:21:51,252
Hey, Joey---he's coming your way

1835
02:23:20,317 --> 02:23:21,045
He dead?

1836
02:23:21,151 --> 02:23:25,747
No, lucky dog---war is over by him

1837
02:23:33,630 --> 02:23:35,291

Mrs. Roman?

1841
02:24:18,908 --> 02:24:20,136
Yeah

1842
02:24:21,611 --> 02:24:23,340
l'm glad---l'm Johnny Seanacy

1843
02:24:23,613 --> 02:24:26,013
Have l told you in my letter---
Mr. Seanacy,

1844
02:24:26,116 --> 02:24:27,913
that she hasn't changed

1845
02:24:28,451 --> 02:24:31,716
Mrs. Seanacy is mentally deranged---

1846
02:24:32,188 --> 02:24:34,053
suicidal

1847
02:24:36,459 --> 02:24:39,485
For the most part, she's normal
rather than rigid

1848
02:24:44,768 --> 02:24:46,998
Women are not very pretty, are they?

1849
02:24:47,070 --> 02:24:49,163
They're hungry mostly

1850
02:24:49,239 --> 02:24:52,231
We don't need to be on diet

1851
02:24:52,342 --> 02:24:54,071
We don't even have sanitary

1852
02:24:54,144 --> 02:24:56,840
Even with the war over, we're still
lack of everything

1853
02:24:56,913 --> 02:24:59,245
War or peace, nobody cares

1854
02:25:06,022 --> 02:25:07,887
Your wife is normal enough now

1855
02:25:07,957 --> 02:25:10,653
She's locked here because l thought
she might like privacy

1856
02:25:22,205 --> 02:25:29,873
Susana---l'm glad to see you

1857
02:25:33,416 --> 02:25:35,646
You shouldn't come

1858
02:25:39,189 --> 02:25:41,487
Mrs. Roman said you---

1859
02:25:45,295 --> 02:25:46,956
Normal?

1860
02:25:53,570 --> 02:25:57,506
l come to love this sound in that wood---

1861
02:25:58,374 --> 02:26:01,775
that beautiful holy sound of it

1862
02:26:08,618 --> 02:26:17,322
l'm afraid---even in my own happiness
with you here

1863
02:26:18,261 --> 02:26:20,661
l'm taking you home with me

1864
02:26:22,799 --> 02:26:24,323
Why?

1865
02:26:24,434 --> 02:26:26,459
l've always got in your way

1866
02:26:26,536 --> 02:26:28,060
No, you haven't

1867
02:26:30,573 --> 02:26:33,906
Now you might even find your raintree

1868
02:26:34,043 --> 02:26:38,139
Susana, there's no raintree

1869
02:26:38,581 --> 02:26:43,245
But l think there's---
and l say it over and over again

1870
02:26:43,353 --> 02:26:45,913
and l make both of us miserable

1871
02:26:46,489 --> 02:26:48,582
And then you begin to pity me

1872
02:26:48,658 --> 02:26:50,853
and l can't accept your pity

1873
02:26:50,960 --> 02:26:52,427
l'd rather be alone

1874
02:26:52,529 --> 02:26:55,862
l don't pity you---l love you

1875
02:26:56,466 --> 02:26:59,060
That's the foundation to build on

1876
02:26:59,802 --> 02:27:04,967
You don't think the foundation too
wicked after all this time?

1877
02:27:05,909 --> 02:27:09,709
We're in an incomplete kind of love---
Johnny

1878
02:27:18,354 --> 02:27:21,619
lt just wouldn't work

1879
02:27:24,260 --> 02:27:29,493

to all the men who died

1886
02:28:29,659 --> 02:28:31,854
Say goodbye, Jim ---

1887
02:28:33,363 --> 02:28:35,126
Jim says goodbye

1888
02:28:35,898 --> 02:28:36,990
Goodnight, Jim

1889
02:28:37,100 --> 02:28:39,466
We'd better say goodnight

1890
02:28:47,944 --> 02:28:48,842
Johnny

1891
02:28:48,945 --> 02:28:49,843
Yes?

1892
02:28:49,946 --> 02:28:51,470
l want to talk to you

1893
02:28:51,581 --> 02:28:52,843
What about?

1894
02:28:53,216 --> 02:28:54,513
You

1895
02:28:56,019 --> 02:28:57,145
Not tonight, Professor---

1896
02:28:57,253 --> 02:28:59,881
l got million compositions to correct

1897
02:28:59,989 --> 02:29:02,856
l thought the world of yours
is a larger issue

1898
02:29:02,925 --> 02:29:07,453
Compositions to correct---
that's a sublime vocation

1899
02:29:07,563 --> 02:29:09,121
l'm afraid so, Professor

1900
02:29:09,232 --> 02:29:11,132
You're quite right, Johnny---
it's not a laughing matter

1901
02:29:11,701 --> 02:29:14,898
Lincoln got a bullet in the brain---
our country is still rip apart

1902
02:29:14,937 --> 02:29:17,531
l for one take the most hopeful view

1903
02:29:17,607 --> 02:29:19,097
About what?

1904
02:29:20,243 --> 02:29:22,040
Lincoln's reconstruction policy

1905
02:29:22,111 --> 02:29:25,046
0h, it never got started---
it was too gentle for most people

1906
02:29:25,448 --> 02:29:26,574
Johnny

1907
02:29:29,185 --> 02:29:30,243
Galwood

1908
02:29:30,319 --> 02:29:33,015
l was just in the neighborhood and
down to railroad station

1909
02:29:33,089 --> 02:29:34,647
paying my last tribute to Lincoln

1910
02:29:34,757 --> 02:29:36,384
0h, that's wit of you

1911
02:29:37,093 --> 02:29:39,254
Good evening---ladies

1912
02:29:39,829 --> 02:29:40,955
l---l just tell you a few minutes

1913
02:29:41,064 --> 02:29:43,089
l'll be very brief, Johnny

1914
02:29:43,566 --> 02:29:45,659
l intend to run for Congress

1915
02:29:46,335 --> 02:29:50,237
l intend to see the barrier south gets
just it deserves

1916
02:29:50,339 --> 02:29:52,569
There's no longer a barrier, Galwood

1917
02:29:52,675 --> 02:29:55,940
lt's beaten---and it's bleeding now

1918
02:29:56,979 --> 02:29:58,537
You're sentimental, Johnny

1919
02:29:58,648 --> 02:30:00,843
Personally l'm a practical politician

1920
02:30:01,317 --> 02:30:04,047
What do you want from
the sentimentalist?

1921
02:30:04,153 --> 02:30:05,950
My election gets lead the big things---

1922
02:30:06,456 --> 02:30:08,686
for me, perhaps, the presidency

1923
02:30:10,359 --> 02:30:11,587
And for me?

1924
02:30:11,661 --> 02:30:13,322
You name it, Johnny

1925
02:30:13,730 --> 02:30:16,665
Let bygones be bygones---
forgive and forget

1926
02:30:17,066 --> 02:30:20,297
We each have a war to fight---
you in your way---

1927
02:30:20,369 --> 02:30:21,301
me in mine

1928
02:30:21,370 --> 02:30:23,497
Lincoln in his---but now---

1929
02:30:24,107 --> 02:30:27,008
Now Lincoln becomes a useful symbol

1930
02:30:27,543 --> 02:30:29,443
and you'd better cash in on it

1931
02:30:31,748 --> 02:30:34,046
l don't cash in on any man

1932
02:30:35,251 --> 02:30:37,310
Johnny, l'm organizing a new party

1933
02:30:37,653 --> 02:30:41,521
Galwood, you always belong to the same party---

1934
02:30:41,624 --> 02:30:43,615
the party of yourself

1935
02:30:45,428 --> 02:30:46,725
Get out

1936
02:31:05,882 --> 02:31:09,340
Well, how do you like that snob now?

1937
02:31:11,821 --> 02:31:15,518
Johnny, you'll run against him

1938
02:31:15,625 --> 02:31:17,820
Statesman, that's a splendid notion

1939
02:31:17,927 --> 02:31:19,189
You could do it, Johnny

1940
02:31:19,295 --> 02:31:21,126
l always said he'd be a great man
in the family

1941
02:31:21,230 --> 02:31:22,424
0h, Johnny, what do you say?

1942
02:31:23,232 --> 02:31:23,926
Not me

1943
02:31:24,033 --> 02:31:25,000
Why not you?

1944
02:31:25,067 --> 02:31:26,830
You wanna be burying yourself
in the books all your life?

1945
02:31:26,903 --> 02:31:28,268
l'm no politician

1946
02:31:28,337 --> 02:31:31,067
Some of the time you call yourself
natural attitude for it---

1947
02:31:31,140 --> 02:31:32,038
You run your actor choice---

1948
02:31:32,108 --> 02:31:35,009
He spends his days teaching his
half-form-mind children

1949
02:31:35,077 --> 02:31:36,704
So he spends his nights writing a book---

1950
02:31:36,779 --> 02:31:38,906
a great book to guide the lost
in the wilderness

1951
02:31:38,981 --> 02:31:40,915
The book somehow never got written

1952
02:31:41,017 --> 02:31:42,507
Well, what happened to it?

1953
02:31:42,585 --> 02:31:44,143
l don't know---the children got talk

1954
02:31:44,220 --> 02:31:45,710
That makes me wildly happy

1955
02:31:45,788 --> 02:31:47,346
Well, you really wouldn't understand---

1956
02:31:47,423 --> 02:31:48,253
you're such an awful teacher

1957
02:31:48,324 --> 02:31:49,291
l'm not my student adorable

1958
02:31:49,358 --> 02:31:50,985
You might make a good politician

1959
02:31:51,093 --> 02:31:52,151
Me?

1960
02:31:53,863 --> 02:31:55,296
Me?

1961
02:31:55,731 --> 02:31:56,561
Why not?

1962
02:31:56,632 --> 02:32:00,124
Right now, politics is on your brow
like a high fever

1963
02:32:00,203 --> 02:32:02,068
Hm ---

1964
02:32:02,171 --> 02:32:03,968
And the fever is mourning

1965
02:32:04,340 --> 02:32:07,867
Yes---if l could now leap out---

1966
02:32:07,944 --> 02:32:08,933
lie out promise to Galwood

1967
02:32:09,011 --> 02:32:13,744
best days ever seen in the back
of the train getting out steam

1968
02:32:13,816 --> 02:32:17,616
when l'm squatting back in my arms with
a boy lighting fire-crackers under me

1969
02:32:18,254 --> 02:32:23,191
Yes, l'm sorry l was so---

1970
02:32:23,793 --> 02:32:27,422
so big mouth---big mouth, huh?

1971
02:32:28,564 --> 02:32:30,794
Yes

1972
02:32:33,703 --> 02:32:35,170
Goodnight

1973
02:32:35,271 --> 02:32:37,034
Goodnight, Professor

1974
02:32:37,640 --> 02:32:48,642
My dear---perhaps even presidency

1975
02:32:51,354 --> 02:32:53,322
Goodnight, Johnny

1976
02:32:53,422 --> 02:32:53,945
Goodnight

1977
02:32:54,056 --> 02:32:55,819
Good evening, Nell

1978
02:32:57,326 --> 02:32:59,055
Goodnight, Mom

1979
02:33:02,231 --> 02:33:06,691
Johnny, l think you're a great book
of your own life

1980
02:33:07,169 --> 02:33:08,602
Don't spoil it

1981
02:33:08,671 --> 02:33:10,161
What you did just now was very clever---

1982
02:33:10,273 --> 02:33:12,434
but it doesn't solve anything

1983
02:33:12,608 --> 02:33:14,872
What are you talking about?

1984
02:33:14,944 --> 02:33:17,174
About the Professor---your candidate---

1985
02:33:17,613 --> 02:33:19,103
but he's not mine

1986
02:33:19,682 --> 02:33:20,842
Who would you choose?

1987
02:33:20,950 --> 02:33:22,144
You

1988
02:33:22,518 --> 02:33:23,382
Please

1989
02:33:23,486 --> 02:33:25,147
Johnny, who else could do with?

1990
02:33:25,254 --> 02:33:27,654
Who else could help you beat
the bleeding south?

1991
02:33:27,757 --> 02:33:29,987
0ne thing about the Professor---
he'll keep his word

1992
02:33:30,092 --> 02:33:32,390
Then he'll out lip and
out lie promise Galwood

1993
02:33:32,461 --> 02:33:33,155
What good he'll do with it?

1994
02:33:33,229 --> 02:33:35,459
Nell, l don't want to talk about it

1995
02:33:35,531 --> 02:33:36,463
Why?

1996
02:33:36,532 --> 02:33:39,330
Because l want you to do something
you're capable of doing?

1997
02:33:39,402 --> 02:33:40,494
Look---l'm out

1998
02:33:40,569 --> 02:33:41,831
l'm not going to run for Congress

1999
02:33:41,938 --> 02:33:43,269
Johnny, if you'd only just---

2000
02:33:43,339 --> 02:33:45,273
Look---it's final

2001
02:33:46,676 --> 02:33:49,236
Johnny, you can't escape responsibility

2002
02:33:49,345 --> 02:33:50,539
Nell---

2003
02:33:56,319 --> 02:33:59,516
Johnny, whatever you do,

2004
02:33:59,622 --> 02:34:02,614
l know you'll do it honorably well

2005
02:34:06,529 --> 02:34:07,359
Goodnight

2006
02:34:07,463 --> 02:34:08,896
Goodnight

2007
02:34:10,399 --> 02:34:13,732
l'm sorry, Susana---l talk too much

2008
02:34:13,869 --> 02:34:15,302
Goodnight

2009
02:34:16,205 --> 02:34:17,797
Nell

2010
02:34:20,810 --> 02:34:26,305
Nell, you still love him, don't you?

2011
02:34:28,985 --> 02:34:31,010
We grew up together

2012
02:34:31,487 --> 02:34:32,920
We love Raintree County

2013
02:34:33,022 --> 02:34:34,990
We went everywhere together

2014
02:34:36,525 --> 02:34:40,291
Yes, l still love him

2015
02:35:06,489 --> 02:35:08,821
lt's because of me---

2016
02:35:09,625 --> 02:35:11,957
because of me you can't run for Congress

2017
02:35:12,028 --> 02:35:14,087
Dear, it's not because of you

2018
02:35:14,163 --> 02:35:16,188
Because l'm sick

2019
02:35:16,298 --> 02:35:18,129
You're not sick---it's just the---

2020
02:35:18,601 --> 02:35:21,229
Well, l'd like to stay here in
Raintree County

2021
02:35:24,640 --> 02:35:33,708
0h, l wonder---l wonder things
would be different

2022
02:35:34,150 --> 02:35:38,712
better if you found your raintree

2023
02:35:40,322 --> 02:35:43,780
l bet Nell could find it for you

2024
02:35:43,959 --> 02:35:47,895
Susana, that was long time ago
l went looking for the raintree

2025
02:35:48,431 --> 02:35:51,093
l'm not even sure l expected to find

2026
02:35:52,635 --> 02:35:55,763
But at least l learned to see
the raintree

2027
02:35:55,838 --> 02:36:00,332
lt's not nearly important as
what you find looking for it

2028
02:36:01,844 --> 02:36:07,612
l'm happy with what l ‘ve found..-you

2029
02:36:16,959 --> 02:36:23,125
All my life, l want someone to love
and love me---

2030
02:36:24,100 --> 02:36:27,866
someone whose voice is touching my ear
in the night---

2031
02:36:27,970 --> 02:36:30,939
shut out the bad dreams---

2032
02:36:32,341 --> 02:36:35,833
someone who'll always be bound to me---

2033
02:36:36,045 --> 02:36:46,546
And that's him ---with such great barrier

2034
02:36:50,960 --> 02:36:59,629
Johnny, don't---
don't work too late, darling

2035
02:38:30,693 --> 02:38:33,662
Mommy, what are you doing?

2036
02:38:33,862 --> 02:38:35,523
Darling

2037
02:38:37,533 --> 02:38:42,232
Jim, l gonna do something for Daddy---

2038
02:38:42,671 --> 02:38:44,696
it's a surprise

2039
02:38:44,840 --> 02:38:46,330
What's it?

2040
02:38:47,543 --> 02:38:51,343
We mustn't tell him
or it won't be a surprise

2041
02:38:51,447 --> 02:38:52,971
l won't tell

2042
02:38:54,817 --> 02:38:59,550
You see l'm going to find the raintree

2043
02:38:59,722 --> 02:39:01,189
For Daddy?

2044
02:39:02,224 --> 02:39:05,591
Yes, darling---for Daddy---

2045
02:39:06,662 --> 02:39:09,256
then everything will be alright

2046
02:39:10,432 --> 02:39:17,770
l'll find the raintree and
hand it to him gently---

2047
02:39:18,607 --> 02:39:20,905
with all my love

2048
02:39:21,844 --> 02:39:23,744
Can l go with you?

2049
02:39:24,046 --> 02:39:28,608
No, darling---l take Jimmy

2050
02:39:29,318 --> 02:39:31,218
l don't understand

2051
02:39:40,763 --> 02:39:46,065
Jim, darling---someday when you're older---

2052
02:39:46,268 --> 02:39:48,566
ask Daddy about it

2053
02:39:49,872 --> 02:39:56,300
He'll be able to explain---
it's Daddy what's for

2054
02:40:06,355 --> 02:40:12,988
The thing---only happened to your father

2055
02:40:13,662 --> 02:40:19,794
because he can't stay one day to have his picture

2056
02:40:22,304 --> 02:40:24,568
Now l was there

2057
02:41:12,654 --> 02:41:16,784
Mr. Seanacy---

2058
02:41:33,375 --> 02:41:35,935
Susana

2059
02:41:54,763 --> 02:41:57,527
Susana

2060
02:42:06,508 --> 02:42:10,604
Susana---hear me?

2061
02:42:19,087 --> 02:42:30,123
Johnny---you'd better come with me

2062
02:43:33,962 --> 02:43:35,293
Jim

2063
02:43:36,098 --> 02:43:38,498
He hasn't been found yet

2064
02:43:49,077 --> 02:43:50,476
Johnny---

2065
02:44:05,561 --> 02:44:07,119
Jimmy

2066
02:44:17,940 --> 02:44:23,139
Jimmy

2067
02:44:25,180 --> 02:44:26,511
Jim

2068
02:44:26,882 --> 02:44:28,406
Daddy

2069
02:44:35,390 --> 02:44:36,914
Daddy

2070
02:44:40,295 --> 02:44:42,160
Jimmy

2071
02:44:43,832 --> 02:44:45,299
Hello

2072
02:44:46,234 --> 02:44:47,861
Hello

2073
02:45:03,952 --> 02:45:05,476
Come on
