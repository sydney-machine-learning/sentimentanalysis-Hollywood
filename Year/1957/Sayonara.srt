1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,041
25.000

2
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,400
"(woman)" ? "Sayonara"

3
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,161
? "Sayonara"

4
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:45,086
? "Sayonara"

5
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:20,682
? "Sayonara"

6
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:27,022
? "Japanese goodbye"

7
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,389
Just like a bird:

8
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:19,115
How many did you get, sir?

9
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,827
- Hey, he got two more:
- Old Gruver got two more:

10
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,996
Nice going there, sir.

11
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,299
Mm-hm.

12
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,885
Let’s try the other lung.

13
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,054
Breathe.

14
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:44,557
- Breathe.
- Hi, Padre.

15
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,562
- Two more MiGs today, I hear, Lloyd.
- Yeah.

16
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:52,148
That’s it. You can put it on.

17
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,446
- Well, Ace, you’ve had it.
- Say what?

18
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,700
You’re through flying for a while, anyway.

19
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:05,912
Oh, no. Nothing wrong with me
a little bottle of beer isn’t gonna fix up.

20
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:08,415
Give him a bottle of beer
and send him back up.

21
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:14,754
- Don’t get yourself excited here.
- Don’t get pale. I was just giving you a rib.

22
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,590
But you could use some sleep.

23
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:21,052
Yeah, I could use
a little nice Korean sleep.

24
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:24,681
Better than that. You’re going to Japan.

25
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,936
- I’m going to Japan? What for?
- Why not?

26
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:33,815
Wouldn’t you like to tangle with
one of those beautiful Japanese dolls?

27
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,236
If it’s your prescription, Doc,
I’ll certainly work at it best I can.

28
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:42,741
You’re going to Kobe.
Kelly has your orders.

29
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,827
What in the world am I gonna do in Kobe?

30
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:50,707
It’s a special request
of General Webster himself.

31
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:55,795
Well, then, this has all been prearranged?

32
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,548
Prearranged? Demanded.

33
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:03,803
Why shouldn’t a three-star general
look out for a four-star general’s son?

34
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:06,723
Don’t get on my back.
I ain’t buckin’ for favours.

35
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,017
I know you haven’t. I was just kidding.

36
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,020
- See you, Doc. Thanks.
- Can I have a word, Gruver?

37
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:16,608
Yeah. I’ll bet you I know what the word is.
K-e-l-l-y. Is that true or false?

38
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,819
He’s got permission to go back
and marry that Japanese girl.

39
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,947
I told him - he can’t take her
back to the States.

40
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:25,617
I explained the law in detail myself.

41
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,453
But there’s no law
which says he can’t marry her,

42
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,414
and he’s appealed to his congressman.

43
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:35,126
- His congressman?
- I wish you’d talk to him.

44
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:39,422
After all, he is one of your men, and you’re
the only human being he looks up to.

45
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:44,427
Listen, I’m gonna tell you something.
That boy don’t look up to anybody.

46
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:49,724
He has been promoted four times
and busted right back again.

47
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:53,853
Yeah, my congressman.
Shocking, ain’t it, Major?

48
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:57,440
Chaplain says don’t marry the girl.
Colonel says don’t marry the girl.

49
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:59,609
You say don’t marry the girl.

50
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:04,114
Congressman says “You marry
that girl, Kelly.” What can I do?

51
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:08,034
I’ll tell you what you can do, boy.
You can go and marry your congressman.

52
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,203
You’d be better off.

53
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,456
Give me coffee.

54
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,625
Yes, sir.

55
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,381
I hear you bagged two more today, Major.

56
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,384
- How was it up there?
- Splendid.

57
00:06:28,138 --> 00:06:31,683
What’s the matter? What happened?

58
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,231
There was a guy with a face
in one of those planes today.

59
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:44,195
There was a guy with a face
in all the other seven you shot down.

60
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,072
Yeah.

61
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,159
That’s exactly
what I’ve been thinking about.

62
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,995
Well, you can stop thinking.

63
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,832
You got a very well-written contract here.

64
00:06:56,791 --> 00:07:01,046
General Webster’s had you assigned
to the inter-service aviation board,

65
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:04,132
which means you got
practically nothing to do.

66
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:10,680
Except, of course, marry the general’s
daughter who arrives in Kobe tomorrow.

67
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,058
- You mean Eileen...?
- That’s right.

68
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:16,728
- General’s wife and daughter both.
- Don’t fool me now.

69
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:22,150
I’m not fooling. You’re not supposed
to know anything about it. Big surprise.

70
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,527
Eileen’s coming to Kobe.

71
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,282
Yeah. General Webster arranges it
for you to marry his daughter,

72
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,994
my congressman arranges it
for me to marry my girl.

73
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,748
Generals for the officers,
congressmen for the peasants.

74
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:40,335
Listen, I’m glad you brought that up, boy.

75
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,631
I think there’s a little bit of difference
that we oughta talk about.

76
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:48,009
- What do you mean?
- Well, now listen.

77
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,221
I never did show you
a picture of my girl, did I, Kelly?

78
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,722
No.

79
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,267
Well, I’m gonna show you
a picture of a girl.

80
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,978
It happens to be my girl,
but she’s American.

81
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,565
And I want you to take
a long, long look at her,

82
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:07,028
because I believe that maybe you forgot
what an American girl looks like.

83
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:12,784
And this girl I’m gonna show to you
is first of all an American girl,

84
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:17,414
a girl with fine character,
a girl with good background,

85
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:20,500
good education, good family, good blood.

86
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:25,755
I’ve known this girl since I was about
that high. Families are very close.

87
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,551
I’ve been engaged to this girl
for a long time, Kelly.

88
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:32,887
Now, she’s a girl of unusual character.

89
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,473
I’d like you to take a look at her,
a close look,

90
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:39,936
and tell me what you think
and what your feeling is.

91
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,236
- Kind of beat up, ain’t she?
- I beg your pardon?

92
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:52,824
No. The beat-up one’s
her mother, you idiot.

93
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,993
Here’s Eileen.

94
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,871
- Now, now...
- Hey.

95
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:01,624
"(Kelly)" She sure does something wicked
to a bathing suit.

96
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:08,006
She has an enormous capacity
to fulfil a bathing suit. That’s enough.

97
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,175
I’m just showing it to you.

98
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,678
But all kidding aside,
the reason I wanna show you this girl...

99
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,306
You ever seen Katsumi?

100
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,892
- Where’s that?
- It’s not a “where’s that?”

101
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:22,854
- It’s the girl I’m marrying.
- Oh. Well, no.

102
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,315
I don’t know Japanese names.

103
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,901
That’s all right. Forget it.

104
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,990
- Well?
- Yeah.

105
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,452
Looks like a bright girl.

106
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:42,540
- She’s a whole lot brighter than me.
- That ain’t too hard to do, you know.

107
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,294
Listen, Kelly, I wanna say
something seriously to you.

108
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,631
Aren’t you taking a risk
in marrying this Japanese girl?

109
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,092
Risks don’t scare me any.

110
00:09:52,217 --> 00:09:55,387
The army and the air force
and the State Department

111
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,972
have ganged up
to keep me from getting married.

112
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,684
Hold on. What do you mean, ganged up?

113
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:03,478
Here, look at these pamphlets.

114
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,606
”Think it over, Americans.”

115
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:11,027
”Things you are required to know and do
before marrying Orientals.”

116
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:15,490
Here’s another piece of garbage.
”But will your family accept her?”

117
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,743
- Will they, Kelly?
- I ain’t got any family.

118
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:22,372
I haven’t got anything
against this girl of yours.

119
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:27,002
I haven’t got anything against
the Japanese any more. Not really.

120
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:30,588
But, you know, when...

121
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:35,760
I just don’t understand
how a normal, average American...

122
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:39,139
Let’s put it this way.

123
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:43,184
I think even your friends are gonna
put you down if you marry this girl.

124
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:48,273
If the friends I got are that kind, they won’t
be friends of mine much longer.

125
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:53,528
Major, I’m gonna marry my girl if I have to
give up my American citizenship to do it.

126
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,240
Kelly, you stupid, ignorant slob.

127
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:01,786
Go ahead and marry this slant-eyed runt
if you want to. It’ll serve you right.

128
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,748
Wait a minute, Major.
Don’t talk to me that way:

129
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:08,418
I won’t take that
from you or anybody else.

130
00:11:08,543 --> 00:11:10,587
{y:i}(pIane fIies overhead)

131
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,299
I’m sorry, Kelly.

132
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,843
I’m sorry.

133
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:21,973
I’m just blowing my stack a little today.

134
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,101
But, boy, I mean it. I...

135
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:31,900
I wanna tell you, when you tell me
that you’re gonna give up your citizenship

136
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,986
for a girl, any girl,

137
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,280
I think you’re nuts.

138
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:42,869
- I think you’re crazy.
- I am crazy. I’m in love crazy.

139
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:46,915
I think you’re gonna cut your throat
and I’d just hate to see you do it.

140
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,918
And I mean that with all sincerity.

141
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:56,841
Maybe that’s because you don’t feel
as strong about your girl as I do mine.

142
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,596
There’s your orders, Major.

143
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,765
See you on the plane.

144
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:10,063
OK.

145
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,863
Kelly.

146
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:28,498
We’re coming in, Major.
There’s the Inland Sea.

147
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:33,169
Beautiful, ain’t it?
Sure is nice scenery out there.

148
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:37,340
That’s Kobe over there.
See it, with all the docks?

149
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:41,177
What you’re looking at, Major,
really is three cities all run together.

150
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:44,014
There’s Kobe, Osaka and Kyoto.

151
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:47,225
- They got kabuki there.
- What’s kabuki?

152
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:51,563
Never heard of kabuki theatre?
All men, no dames.

153
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:55,316
- That’s gonna be dull, ain’t it?
- I don’t know.

154
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:59,696
If it’s all dames you want,
I think we’re gonna get there in about...

155
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,948
Yep. Look down there.

156
00:13:02,073 --> 00:13:06,578
See that little park over there with
the lakes around it? That’s Matsubayashi.

157
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,330
- Where?
- Right down in there. See it?

158
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,375
The Matsubayashi girls
are the most famous in Japan.

159
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,587
They sing, they dance,
they act all the parts. No men.

160
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,757
Katsumi knows all the actresses.
She’s a movie fan.

161
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:24,137
You’re just blowin’ your top about
seeing Katsumi, aren’t you? Carryin’ on...

162
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,306
She’s my girl, Major.

163
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,239
- Well, GG, good to see you.
- So long, Lloyd.

164
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:46,951
- Lots of luck to you.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

165
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,330
Lloyd: Lloyd: Here we are.

166
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,123
Lloyd:

167
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,126
- Hey, there:
- Don’t forget to act surprised.

168
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,546
Yeah, hi there: Hot dog:

169
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,174
Won’t he be surprised:

170
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,343
- Major?
- Yeah?

171
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,430
How about being my best man?

172
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:14,854
Listen, Kelly, I told you
that I’m against this marriage.

173
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:18,983
It would mean a lot to me.
What do you say, Major?

174
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,074
OK.

175
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:30,036
Consul’s office. 10 o’clock, Saturday.

176
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,836
Well, come on, honey. Hurry up.

177
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:45,010
Well, now. Come here, you:

178
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:47,303
Hi:

179
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:50,515
Certainly good to see you.
Hi, sir. Nice to see you.

180
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:55,770
I said “There’s General Webster
but who is that good-looking woman?”

181
00:14:55,895 --> 00:15:00,817
- Tell me about Eileen. How is she?
- She finds Tulsa terribly dull without you.

182
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:03,778
Well, I wish she could have come along.

183
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,198
Lloyd, you couldn’t expect us
to bring her out here.

184
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:11,286
You’re registered at the hotel for the first
few nights but stationed here after that.

185
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,997
- I see.
- Let’s go. You get in first.

186
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,542
- You go ahead, Mrs Webster.
- No, you get in first.

187
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,295
- Go on, get in.
- No, ladies first.

188
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:24,799
Hi, Lloyd.

189
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,428
You devil.

190
00:15:28,553 --> 00:15:30,597
Come here.

191
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,439
I’m glad to see you, darling.

192
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,823
I forgot what an ugly girl you got here.

193
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,368
She’s not ugly. She’s a beautiful girl.

194
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,371
She’s the ugliest girl I ever saw.

195
00:15:56,706 --> 00:16:01,628
And that dress is terrible.
It just goes in and out. That’s awful.

196
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:05,423
It’s meant to go in and out. I go in and out.

197
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,510
Well, we’ll talk about that later.

198
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,524
Send Major Gruver’s luggage
up to his room, will you?

199
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,484
That’s beautiful, isn’t it?

200
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:28,321
- Are there any rules against it?
- No, but it’s understood...

201
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,449
I thought the club would be honoured.

202
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,744
Please, Mike, let’s go.

203
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:38,373
- What’s she doing here?
- Mother:

204
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:43,712
- Isn’t she with that young officer?
- Kobe’s a recreation centre.

205
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:46,172
- That’s right.
- It degrades the uniform.

206
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:49,300
- It’s out-and-out fraternisation.
- She’s beautiful.

207
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,885
All the more reason.

208
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,054
Mark?

209
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,806
Colonel Crawford.

210
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:59,561
- Let’s get outta this clip joint.
- Just a minute, Captain Bailey.

211
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:04,065
- What’s the trouble?
- I didn’t mean to bother you with this.

212
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:07,318
Captain Bailey here is wanting
to take her into the club.

213
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:13,950
General Webster, sir, this young lady
is one of Japan’s most famous dancers.

214
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:16,494
She’s no ordinary...

215
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,663
Yes, I understand.

216
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,461
Even so, don’t you realise
this club is only for American personnel?

217
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:29,966
Now, we’ve been pretty easy
about fraternisation in this area,

218
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,635
even though there are
strict orders against it.

219
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:38,433
But when an officer
who should be an example...

220
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,810
Am I to understand, sir,
that you personally

221
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:44,481
refuse to allow me
to take this young lady into the club?

222
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:51,404
I understand how you feel, Captain,
and I’m very embarrassed, but I’m sorry.

223
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:54,115
- Thank you.
- Thank you, "sir."

224
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,286
Don’t you know there’s such a thing
as insolence through manner?

225
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,455
Thank you, "sir."

226
00:18:07,462 --> 00:18:10,799
Come on in, boys. Eileen has to change.

227
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,885
- Eileen’s taking you to the kabuki tonight.
- Good.

228
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,597
We met Mr Nakamura, the head actor,
and he invited her to come.

229
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:22,352
Isn’t that where there’s no dames
and the men play all the women’s parts?

230
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,772
That’s right, the way they do at Princeton.
Come on, Mark.

231
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,316
It’s gonna be fun. Come on, baby.

232
00:18:50,213 --> 00:18:53,299
{y:i}(Japanese music and singing)

233
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,139
Did you bring your lunch?

234
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,145
{y:i}(speak in Japanese)

235
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:10,316
”Miss Eileen Webster.” Ah:

236
00:19:10,442 --> 00:19:12,485
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

237
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:33,465
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

238
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,350
{y:i}(shouts in Japanese)

239
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,360
- Who’s fightin’ her?
- That’s Nakamura.

240
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:58,323
- He’s the one I met. He’s very famous.
- Is that Nakamura?

241
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:02,952
It’s about a lady who turns into a lion.

242
00:20:03,078 --> 00:20:08,249
She gonna turn into a lion right here?
I wanna see that.

243
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:32,982
I love you, Lloyd. I love you terribly.

244
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:36,903
I always have and I guess I always will.

245
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,072
I love you, honey.

246
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,617
Awful glad you’re here, too.

247
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:55,338
Everybody acting
like nobody ever kissed in the world.

248
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:38,381
She wouldn’t be half so ugly if she didn’t
stick her face in that flour barrel.

249
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,717
She?

250
00:21:40,842 --> 00:21:42,886
Well, whatever.

251
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:45,889
He had me.

252
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:57,942
He’s a male actress. It says here
they’ve been trained since childhood

253
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:01,071
to have the grace of a woman
and yet the power of a man.

254
00:22:01,196 --> 00:22:02,322
Oh, my word.

255
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,118
My lord: That’s my father:

256
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:38,525
Is he man enough now for you, Lloyd?

257
00:22:39,651 --> 00:22:41,695
Is that the same fellow?

258
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,655
Uh-huh.

259
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:04,300
It’s all right.

260
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,938
I am sure it must be very difficult

261
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:20,859
to enjoy theatre
so different from your own.

262
00:23:20,984 --> 00:23:24,612
- We found it fascinating.
- I am glad.

263
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:28,575
Kabuki’s very old, isn’t it?

264
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,119
Some 300 years.

265
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:35,290
I find myself becoming intrigued
by everything in Japan.

266
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:41,504
I should be happy to help you know
my country better, if at any time I can.

267
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:47,177
You did not enjoy the evening so much,
I fear, Major Gruver.

268
00:23:47,302 --> 00:23:50,472
Oh, yeah. I thought it was a fine play.

269
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:57,437
I thought maybe you could use a Marilyn
Monroe here and there, you know, to...

270
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:05,820
Unfortunately, Miss Monroes were barred
from kabuki in the 1 7th century.

271
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:10,950
I didn’t mean to sound corny.
I just didn’t know what to say about it.

272
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:13,495
Please, do not apologise.

273
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:18,625
I am great admirer of Miss Monroe myself.

274
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,128
That’s two of us. That’s you and me, boy.

275
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:31,971
No, don’t do it to me. It’s real good.
Thank you very much. Why not?

276
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:35,642
- Let’s go and see the garden.
- OK, you go on. I’ll take this.

277
00:24:37,352 --> 00:24:40,897
That’s fine, fine cooking. Very good.

278
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,324
Here you are, honey.

279
00:24:51,449 --> 00:24:54,536
- No, thank you.
- Don’t care for any?

280
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:58,873
- Sit down, darling.
- You look awful pretty.

281
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,880
I’ve been doing a lot of thinking
with you away, Lloyd.

282
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,967
- Answer me one thing.
- What’s that, honey?

283
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:11,553
Why aren’t we married now?

284
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,433
- Isn’t that a silly question?
- No, not really.

285
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:19,269
You do a lot of wondering in Tulsa.

286
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:23,773
Well, I suppose the Korean War
might have a little something to do with it.

287
00:25:23,898 --> 00:25:27,485
Wasn’t Korea maybe convenient, Lloyd?

288
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:28,737
Convenient?

289
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:35,368
What I really mean is... do I mean
everything to you as you do to me?

290
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,120
Course you do, honey.

291
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:40,915
I went to visit your mother
before I came here, there in Richmond.

292
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:41,916
My mother?

293
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:45,211
I was appalled at the loneliness
in which she lives,

294
00:25:45,337 --> 00:25:47,672
and the way your father’s content to go off

295
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:50,216
and leave her walled up
in a circle of friends

296
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:53,261
while he plunges off to the war.

297
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:57,599
Hold on a second. You’ve got to
remember my father’s a general, honey.

298
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:59,976
Besides, my mother
wants to live that way.

299
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,687
- Don’t be ridiculous.
- Don’t tell me that.

300
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:08,318
No woman wants to live any way except
body and soul with the man she loves.

301
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:11,446
You’ll never tuck me away
in some little town.

302
00:26:11,571 --> 00:26:15,450
Become the greatest general
in air-force history, but love me too.

303
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:18,536
But do I love you, baby. I do.

304
00:26:20,538 --> 00:26:27,170
Well, I guess all I’m trying to say is that -
and I really mean this, Lloyd -

305
00:26:27,295 --> 00:26:30,799
if what you want
is a family like our fathers have

306
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:33,802
and promotion in the air force

307
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:37,931
and position in society
like our mothers have,

308
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:44,896
and you marry me because I’m pretty and
smart and have guts and know the ropes...

309
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:51,361
then I don’t think
you want to marry me, Lloyd.

310
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:55,490
I’m sorry.
I guess I’ve been thinking too much.

311
00:26:57,033 --> 00:27:00,954
Yeah, I think you have
been thinking too much.

312
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:19,806
Now...

313
00:27:19,931 --> 00:27:22,058
Now quit it.

314
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:26,396
OK. I don’t know.
Maybe things’ll turn out after all.

315
00:27:26,521 --> 00:27:29,649
What do you mean, maybe?
Sure, it’s gonna turn out.

316
00:27:29,774 --> 00:27:34,279
It’s just all that nonsense you talk about
every time we get together.

317
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:38,199
Nonsense? I hadn’t realised
it was nonsense.

318
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:41,077
Course it is, honey. It’s all very simple.

319
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:43,079
Now, look here.

320
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:48,293
I want a wife and a family.
I want a home in America.

321
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:53,590
And every time I think of a home like that,
I think about it with a woman like you.

322
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:56,176
A girl with a good army
background like my own...

323
00:27:56,301 --> 00:28:00,847
What do you mean, a girl like me?
I’m not a type. I’m me.

324
00:28:00,972 --> 00:28:04,267
Lloyd, it’s me you’ve got to love.

325
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:10,607
Haven’t you ever felt like grabbing me and
hauling me off to a shack somewhere?

326
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:13,777
You know better than that.
Of course I have.

327
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:17,405
- Then what’s holding you back?
- Eileen, are you ever gonna grow up?

328
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,700
There’s a right time
and a wrong time to do things.

329
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:25,455
You have responsibilities to other people.
You have a position to fulfil.

330
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,542
- You’re not alone in this world.
- You defend yourself like a fort.

331
00:28:29,668 --> 00:28:34,631
No matter how I defend myself, you gotta
understand I am not in a position

332
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:39,427
to be hauling my fiancée away
to a shack somewhere like an alley cat.

333
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,721
I wasn’t brought up that way.

334
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:44,391
You’re going to do everything
expected of you?

335
00:28:44,516 --> 00:28:46,768
I’m certainly gonna try.

336
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:50,063
I don’t expect you to marry me
just because it’s expected of you.

337
00:28:50,188 --> 00:28:53,775
Sometimes I look at you
and I don’t understand you.

338
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:59,906
I think sometimes I don’t even know
who you are or what you’re all about.

339
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:03,660
Maybe you don’t. Maybe you never will.

340
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,846
- ..so long as you both shall live?
- I will.

341
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:25,849
Katsumi, wilt though have this man
to thy wedded husband,

342
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:29,561
to live together after God’s ordinance
in the holy state of matrimony,

343
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:33,481
love him, comfort him, honour
and keep him, in sickness and in health,

344
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:40,530
and forsaking all others keep thee only
unto him, so long as you both shall live?

345
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,909
- She will.
- She will.

346
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:50,582
If any man can show just cause why
they may not be lawfully joined together,

347
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:54,669
let him now speak
or else hereafter for ever hold his peace.

348
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:04,471
Do you realise
you waive all your legal rights?

349
00:30:04,596 --> 00:30:06,681
I signed all the papers, didn’t I?

350
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:10,894
You’ll have to look after your wife on
your own. The air force is not responsible.

351
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:14,522
Yeah, I know. Romantic, ain’t it, Major?

352
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:19,903
Will you finish this ugly deed
and get it over?

353
00:30:20,028 --> 00:30:22,405
I pronounce you man and wife.
Sign over there.

354
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,574
Just a minute.

355
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:47,514
That’s it, Mrs Kelly. Just you and me now.

356
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:01,361
Where do we sign?

357
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:03,988
May as well witness this now, Major.

358
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:05,824
Yeah, all right.

359
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:10,578
It was a great honour meeting you,
Major Gruver.

360
00:31:10,704 --> 00:31:12,497
Thank you.

361
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:18,211
Tell me, Consul, are all these ceremonies
conducted like this?

362
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:22,382
Well, we do our best
to prevent as many as possible.

363
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:27,470
We make the paperwork so difficult
that a good many of them lose steam.

364
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:33,727
About how many GIs
have gone through this ceremony?

365
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:38,523
About... 10,000.

366
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:43,028
10,000? Well, then,
you let a few slip by you, didn’t you?

367
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:45,196
A few, yes.

368
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:49,075
How’s your girl, Major?

369
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,995
Eileen? I haven’t seen her
in a couple of days.

370
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,873
I’ve been moving in,
getting my things arranged.

371
00:31:54,998 --> 00:32:00,295
She’s been hightailing it
with the brass, socialising.

372
00:32:01,463 --> 00:32:04,466
Major, ain’t you gonna kiss the bride?

373
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:08,845
Sure, I’m gonna kiss the bride.

374
00:32:09,554 --> 00:32:12,015
Yeah. Sure.

375
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:17,854
Listen, I want you to take good care
of this boy, you hear?

376
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:24,486
Here’s your ticket, honey. Don’t forget it.

377
00:32:25,862 --> 00:32:27,572
OK, boy.

378
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:32,869
Thanks, Major. Took a lot of guts
for you to come here today.

379
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:33,995
Quit.

380
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,167
If you ever need a job done that you West
Point guys ain’t allowed to do yourselves,

381
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:40,669
I’m your man.

382
00:32:40,794 --> 00:32:45,006
- I’m gonna call on you.
- Come on, let’s get a belt.

383
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,426
- How are you, Lloyd?
- Fine, just fine.

384
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:51,221
- That’s a pretty dress you got on.
- Thanks.

385
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:53,640
Lloyd, sit down, son.

386
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:55,809
All righty.

387
00:32:58,436 --> 00:33:03,566
- Thank you for coming over so promptly.
- That’s all right. I was just darning socks.

388
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:06,361
Lloyd...

389
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:12,367
I don’t exactly know how to put this.
It’s a little embarrassing. For me, that is.

390
00:33:12,492 --> 00:33:15,745
You were a witness
at a marriage yesterday between...

391
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:19,207
one of your men and a Japanese girl.

392
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:23,795
Yeah, one of the men
from my outfit in Korea.

393
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:30,010
You realise, of course, there’s an army
policy to discourage all such marriages.

394
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:36,099
I think they couldn’t have been
discouraged. They’re very much in love.

395
00:33:36,224 --> 00:33:41,980
I dare say. However, you personally
seemed to sanction the marriage...

396
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:45,567
No, I didn’t mean
to give that impression at all.

397
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:49,362
I didn’t sanction it.
I tried to talk him out of it before.

398
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:53,491
But, Lloyd, darling,
you did act as his witness.

399
00:33:53,616 --> 00:33:56,703
Well, as long as
it was gonna be inevitable,

400
00:33:56,828 --> 00:33:59,748
I thought I might as well
try to make it pleasant.

401
00:33:59,873 --> 00:34:02,208
Don’t you see the position
that puts me in?

402
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:05,170
Since I’m the area commander here...

403
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:10,300
You didn’t do anything to encourage
this marriage, sir. I did all this on my own.

404
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:14,387
What do you mean?
On your own, Lloyd, dear?

405
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:19,684
Everything you do reflects on the general.
After all, he is Eileen’s father.

406
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:22,437
This places me
in a position of incompetence

407
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:26,983
when it comes to doing anything
to help my own men.

408
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:31,780
Let’s stop beating around the bush.
What’s wrong between you and Eileen?

409
00:34:31,905 --> 00:34:35,700
You haven’t been to see her
for several days.

410
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:44,584
Well... you talked about
being embarrassed, sir, before.

411
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:47,087
I’m embarrassed too.

412
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:51,007
- What about?
- About my whole situation here.

413
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:55,011
I’m a pilot, sir. I was doing a job in Korea.
An unfinished job.

414
00:34:55,136 --> 00:34:57,222
I’m pulled off that job and sent here

415
00:34:57,347 --> 00:35:01,643
and plonked down at a desk
at this inter-service whatever it is.

416
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:05,188
As far as I can see,
there’s absolutely nothing to do.

417
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:07,524
All so’s I can be with Eileen.

418
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:11,861
There’s nothing dishonest about it.
That is, if you plan to get married.

419
00:35:11,986 --> 00:35:17,075
- I think I know how Lloyd feels.
- Do you plan to get married or not?

420
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,121
- Really, dear.
- I’m her mother. I want to know.

421
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:29,212
Well, Mrs Webster, as of the moment,
Eileen isn’t too sure about it and I...

422
00:35:29,337 --> 00:35:35,677
We know, Lloyd, dear. There’s evidently
been some slight strain between you two,

423
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:38,638
but don’t let it become too important.

424
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:43,601
This is Sunday night. Why don’t you
call her up later and ask her out to dinner?

425
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:44,936
Well...

426
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:48,606
Mother, I found the dearest little shop...

427
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:51,735
- Hi, Lloyd.
- Hello, Eileen.

428
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,320
Lloyd just came in to see you.

429
00:35:54,446 --> 00:35:56,531
Oh?

430
00:35:57,657 --> 00:35:59,701
Listen...

431
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:03,788
I thought... It’s Sunday night
and I thought maybe

432
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:09,961
you and I can go out and catch a movie
or something, if you feel like it.

433
00:36:10,086 --> 00:36:13,798
I’m sorry, Lloyd. I’m having dinner
with some friends tonight.

434
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:16,926
Well, what about tomorrow?

435
00:36:18,261 --> 00:36:20,305
That’s booked too, I’m afraid.

436
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:28,146
Well, it looks as though
I’m holding pretty tough cards.

437
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:32,567
What about next week?

438
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:36,029
Of course, Lloyd. Call me.

439
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:40,950
OK.

440
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:45,705
Mrs Webster, General.

441
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:47,874
- Goodbye, Lloyd.
- Goodbye, Eileen.

442
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:50,043
Goodbye, Lloyd.

443
00:36:56,174 --> 00:37:00,512
Eileen, why did you tell him
you were busy tonight?

444
00:37:02,097 --> 00:37:05,934
Because I don’t want to see Lloyd Gruver
when you ask him to see me.

445
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:11,731
Besides, I do have a date with that young
lieutenant and his wife from Fort Bragg.

446
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:13,900
A whole bunch of us.

447
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,368
I hope you don’t lose my man for me.

448
00:37:45,056 --> 00:37:48,143
Give me a martini, will you?

449
00:37:48,852 --> 00:37:50,895
No, make it a lemonade.

450
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:54,733
No, give me a scotch and soda.

451
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,820
- Scotch and soda.
- Scotch and soda, sir.

452
00:37:58,945 --> 00:38:04,117
There’s such a thing as insolence
through manner, you know.

453
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:12,625
I hate to admit it,
but I guess that’s what I said.

454
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:19,716
I thought it sounded kinda strange coming
from a guy who shot down nine MiGs.

455
00:38:19,841 --> 00:38:23,178
That’s a kind of reflex action.
I’m a West Point man, you know.

456
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:26,056
I guess it sneaks out sometimes.

457
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:34,606
So listen, Captain, what does a fella
do round here after the sun goes down?

458
00:38:34,731 --> 00:38:37,317
Why? You on the loose?

459
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:40,487
Halfway.

460
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:43,198
Bring him another.

461
00:38:43,323 --> 00:38:46,493
What part of the south are you from?

462
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:50,914
Almost any old place
that’s got an army post on it.

463
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:54,084
I was all set to take the exams
for West Point

464
00:38:54,209 --> 00:38:59,631
and there was a teacher there who
made me take a part in the school play.

465
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:04,177
They were doing one of
those Hungarian things by Molnár.

466
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:09,099
You never did hear a Hungarian play
played in a southern accent, did you?

467
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:14,020
- No, I’m afraid I missed that.
- That’s a shame. I was awful good in it.

468
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:18,191
Anyhow, I suddenly
didn’t wanna go to West Point

469
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:21,736
and didn’t wanna have
anything to do with it.

470
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:25,323
My mother come up to school and...

471
00:39:25,448 --> 00:39:31,413
She said “We expected you to go to
the Point like your father and his father.”

472
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:39,045
And I told her, I said I had an idea
about a whole different way of life.

473
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,297
What’d she say to that?

474
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:44,259
She said something like...

475
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:49,514
if I ever once had that idea,
I shouldn’t let anything stop me.

476
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:54,394
And she couldn’t come right out
and say “Don’t go to the Point”,

477
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:57,147
but I knew what she meant.

478
00:39:57,731 --> 00:40:00,400
Then my father flew up from Texas and...

479
00:40:00,525 --> 00:40:02,610
He put you straight, huh?

480
00:40:02,736 --> 00:40:08,783
He just looked at me and said “If you don’t
wanna go to the Point, don’t go.”

481
00:40:08,908 --> 00:40:13,038
”The unhappiest men I know
are those who...

482
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:16,958
were forced into something
they got no inaptitude for.”

483
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,253
How did he force you to go to the Point?

484
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:22,964
That’s what I’m telling you.
He didn’t force me.

485
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:29,304
We just had a little talk and he flew
back to Texas and I went on to the Point.

486
00:40:30,138 --> 00:40:31,723
I see.

487
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:36,019
Well, I’ll tell you something though, Mike,

488
00:40:36,144 --> 00:40:40,190
I never once had any regrets
about going to the Point.

489
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:46,154
Except, just lately, I’ve had
some old feeling come back on me.

490
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:50,367
I don’t know if I wanna go on
in the air force and buck for a star,

491
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:56,790
get married into the Webster family
and get swallowed up by all that.

492
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:59,876
I think maybe my old lady was right.

493
00:41:01,378 --> 00:41:04,839
Well, what does it all mean?

494
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:08,259
The eternal struggle, sex,

495
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:10,428
New York Yankees.

496
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:13,807
All right. Quit now. Come on.

497
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:26,653
- Ain’t that a nice-looking bridge?
- "(Mike)" That’s the Bitchi-Bashi.

498
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:29,864
- Say what?
- The Bitchi-Bashi.

499
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:35,036
"Bashï"s Japanese for bridge. We call
this particular one the Bitchi-Bashi

500
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:39,749
because there’s so much
lovely stuff that goes over it.

501
00:41:39,874 --> 00:41:42,043
Did you say stuff?

502
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:44,212
Brother, I said stuff.

503
00:41:45,755 --> 00:41:49,300
Would you care to tell me
what we’re standing in the bushes for?

504
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:51,511
- Can’t touch it.
- Why not?

505
00:41:51,636 --> 00:41:56,016
These girls that go over there
are the Matsubayashi girls.

506
00:41:56,141 --> 00:42:01,479
They just cross over there on the way
to the theatre from those dormitories.

507
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:04,441
"(Gruver)" That’s right.
Somebody told me about them.

508
00:42:04,566 --> 00:42:05,817
"(? singing)"

509
00:42:05,942 --> 00:42:09,612
Hey, boy, is there anything
going over there now?

510
00:42:12,365 --> 00:42:14,826
"(BaiIey)" Hey, come on.
The goods are on display.

511
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:16,995
Wait for me, buddy.

512
00:42:45,857 --> 00:42:48,985
There’s Fumiko-san,
the one you saw me with.

513
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:52,697
- Yeah, little one in pink.
- Yeah, that’s the one.

514
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:56,743
Are you goin’ over to say hello?

515
00:42:56,868 --> 00:43:00,080
In public? A Matsubayashi girl?
Are you nuts?

516
00:43:00,205 --> 00:43:04,250
- You’d take her to the officers’ club.
- That’s for Americans.

517
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:07,629
Thought I could sneak her in
without her being recognised.

518
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:11,508
- "(Gruver)" What happens if they catch her?
- "(BaiIey)" Immediate dismissal.

519
00:43:11,633 --> 00:43:13,385
- "(Gruver)" No fooling?
- "(Bailey)" Yeah.

520
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:16,596
No Matsubayashi girl is allowed
to have dates of any kind.

521
00:43:16,721 --> 00:43:19,099
You were dating her.

522
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:21,267
Well, I’m different.

523
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:23,436
Get outta here.

524
00:43:23,561 --> 00:43:28,983
Like I told President Truman “You was
wrong when you sold the marines short.”

525
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:34,197
See, I hate to be stuffy about this, but
you air-force men wouldn’t understand.

526
00:43:34,322 --> 00:43:41,413
The marines have got "I’amour," and these
girls, they got fame, wealth, bright lights.

527
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:45,542
- But they ain’t got "I’amour."
- You got "I’amour."

528
00:43:47,252 --> 00:43:49,879
{y:i}(excited shouting)

529
00:43:54,426 --> 00:43:57,387
- What’s going on now?
- Hana-ogi’s coming.

530
00:43:57,512 --> 00:44:01,224
- Who?
- Hana-ogi. She’s the top. Number one.

531
00:44:04,352 --> 00:44:07,022
Come on, let’s go.

532
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:29,461
How come she’s dressed like that?

533
00:44:29,586 --> 00:44:32,714
Tall ones play men’s parts mostly.

534
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:36,634
- They play women’s parts too.
- How do you do?

535
00:44:42,265 --> 00:44:45,143
What do you say let’s see the show?

536
00:44:45,977 --> 00:44:48,021
Well, come on, Ace.

537
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:53,777
"(? band plays)"

538
00:45:47,038 --> 00:45:49,833

00:47:26,012 --> 00:47:30,642
- Do you follow the plot?
- Yeah, nothing wrong with the plot.

545
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:38,566
{y:i}(applause)

{y:i}(women singing)

552
00:50:36,077 --> 00:50:38,371
Are you sure they come back this way?

553
00:50:38,496 --> 00:50:41,666
Just keep yourself in check, son.

554
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:45,462
Am I nuts
or is she the greatest thing I ever saw?

555
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:49,090
Whatever you’re thinking, forget it.
You ain’t going anyplace.

556
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,551
Yeah? How’s this for introduction?

557
00:50:51,676 --> 00:50:56,139
She comes along and I just kinda
walk on by and slip my arm around her.

558
00:50:56,264 --> 00:51:00,018
- What do you think of that?
- I think we’d better go.

559
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:03,021
- Major.
- Hey, Kelly, how are you?

560
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:06,483
- How’s everything?
- Saw you at the show.

561
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:09,569
I want you to meet Captain Bailey.
This is Airman Kelly.

562
00:51:09,694 --> 00:51:11,821
- Nice to meet you.
- How do you do, sir?

563
00:51:11,946 --> 00:51:14,157
- How you been, boy?
- Fine.

564
00:51:14,282 --> 00:51:17,660
- Here’s Katsumi.
- Hello there, Katsumi.

565
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:23,708
- Say something, kid.
- It is fine to see you among us tonight.

566
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:26,961
She’s speaking better English
than you are, boy.

567
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:31,132
She’s been taking English lessons
and I’ve been studying a little Japanese.

568
00:51:31,257 --> 00:51:33,718
Let’s hear you go.

569
00:51:34,594 --> 00:51:36,638
{y:i}- (speaks Japanese)
{y:i}- (Katsumi giggles)

570
00:51:36,763 --> 00:51:39,849
I hope he can get rid of it, don’t you?

571
00:51:39,974 --> 00:51:42,977
It means “My feet are cold”.
She always laughs when I say that.

572
00:51:43,103 --> 00:51:45,689
How you been?
How you gettin’ along down there?

573
00:51:45,814 --> 00:51:49,901
Just fine, Major. We got
a wonderful house down by the canal.

574
00:51:50,026 --> 00:51:54,114
Didn’t you tell me Katsumi
knows those Matsubayashi girls?

575
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,991
Sure, she’s a real fan.

576
00:51:57,117 --> 00:51:59,744
I want you to do something for me.

577
00:51:59,869 --> 00:52:03,790
I am trying in the worst way
to meet this Hana-ogi.

578
00:52:03,915 --> 00:52:08,628
And I want you to ask her if she won’t,
you know, kinda introduce me.

579
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:12,048
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

580
00:52:16,845 --> 00:52:19,305
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

581
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,562
She says the rules are very strict
but she’ll ask her.

582
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:28,148
- She will ask her?
- "(Kelly)" Oh, yeah.

583
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:32,527
Cos I said to Truman
when he came over to the house,

584
00:52:32,652 --> 00:52:36,948
”Harry, don’t ever sell the air force short.”

585
00:52:37,073 --> 00:52:38,908
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

586
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:48,626
All right, boy.
Now you gonna see something.

587
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:01,765
Here comes Fumiko-san.

588
00:53:22,535 --> 00:53:24,662
- Here comes Hana-ogi.
- I know it.

589
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:34,005
- You ain’t gonna let me down? Go on.
- It’s all right, Major.

590
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,174
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

591
00:53:49,562 --> 00:53:51,606
How d’you do, Miss Ogi?

592
00:53:55,694 --> 00:53:58,446
You think you made the grade, Ace?

593
00:53:58,571 --> 00:54:01,282
She gave me a nice little look there.

594
00:54:01,408 --> 00:54:03,868
She sure did.

595
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:10,083
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

596
00:54:23,013 --> 00:54:27,559
She says that Hana-ogi
will not speak to an American.

597
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:29,310
Why not?

598
00:54:29,436 --> 00:54:32,772
We shot her brother
and killed her father with our bombs.

599
00:54:32,897 --> 00:54:35,108
I didn’t do it.

600
00:54:35,233 --> 00:54:38,570
Sure you did, Ace. We all did.

601
00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:42,157
Come on.

602
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:44,325
Come on, Ace.

603
00:54:55,837 --> 00:54:57,881
{y:i}(speak Japanese)

604
00:55:00,383 --> 00:55:06,222
If they’re so strict with you, how come
you go out with Mike and fool around?

605
00:55:06,348 --> 00:55:09,017
It is very bad of me.

606
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:12,145
But I cannot help myself.

607
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,314
He’s so tall.

608
00:55:17,233 --> 00:55:22,238
He’s a big boy, all right.
There’s no fooling about that.

609
00:55:22,364 --> 00:55:27,160
But, listen, what I really wanna know is

610
00:55:27,285 --> 00:55:31,664
does this Hana-ogi ever go out on dates,
like you and Mike?

611
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:37,170
No. She’s number one girl.
Must be special careful.

612
00:55:37,295 --> 00:55:40,924
Well, I want you to do me a favour.

613
00:55:41,049 --> 00:55:45,428
Will you do it? When you go back
to the dormitory tonight,

614
00:55:45,553 --> 00:55:51,142
I want you to tell Hana-ogi that
Major Gruver would like to meet her and...

615
00:55:51,267 --> 00:55:54,062
Wait. Now, wait.

616
00:55:54,187 --> 00:55:57,023
I just wanna talk to her for a little while.

617
00:55:57,148 --> 00:56:01,111
- Will you do that for me?
- Never happen.

618
00:56:01,236 --> 00:56:04,989
Hana-ogi-san never speak men.

619
00:56:05,782 --> 00:56:10,036
And with American never happen.

620
00:56:10,161 --> 00:56:15,208
Well, honey, I am here to tell you
that it’s going to happen.

621
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:26,928
{y:i}(women singing in Japanese)

622
00:56:52,704 --> 00:56:59,461
Pardon me, Miss Ogi.
I wonder if I could have your autograph?

623
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,141
Thank you very much.

624
00:57:30,909 --> 00:57:33,370

Hi, Major. I’ve been looking for you.

628
00:59:20,727 --> 00:59:22,812
Hello, Mr Kelly.

629
00:59:22,937 --> 00:59:26,107
The wife says to be at the house tonight.

630
00:59:26,232 --> 00:59:33,281
No, I tell you, boy, I have an engagement
this evening with a friend of mine.

631
00:59:35,617 --> 00:59:39,704
Be there, bub. Hana-ogi’s coming. Sir.

632
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:45,877
- Kelly...
- Be there early.

633
00:59:46,002 --> 00:59:48,046
Kelly.

634
01:00:17,158 --> 01:00:19,202
- Hello.
- "(all)" Hello:

635
01:00:20,203 --> 01:00:22,872
You know where Joe Kelly lives?

636
01:00:23,748 --> 01:00:26,626
Over there? You show me, will you?

637
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,804
How do?

638

{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

639
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:52,402
- Hi, Ace.
- Kelly, is that you?

640
01:00:53,361 --> 01:00:56,197
- How are you?
- How are you, Ace?

641
01:00:56,322 --> 01:01:00,118
- Nice to see you. Come in the house.
- Let me just take a check here.

642
01:01:00,243 --> 01:01:02,245
- Did she come yet?
- No.

- OK. What she say?
- Don’t ask me.

648
01:01:23,558 --> 01:01:27,270
Off with the shoes. You don’t
wear shoes in a Japanese house.

649
01:01:27,395 --> 01:01:30,231
Coming off. What about the pants?

650
01:01:30,357 --> 01:01:32,609
- The room on your right.
- Here?

651
01:01:32,734 --> 01:01:34,778
That’s it.

652
01:01:35,862 --> 01:01:38,698
Watch your head, Ace. This is it.

653
01:01:38,823 --> 01:01:42,786
This is all right, boy.
This is cute. This is nice.

654

Sit down over here, Ace. That’s
the place of honour in a Japanese house.

655
01:01:49,918 --> 01:01:52,128
What’s this thing?

656
01:01:52,253 --> 01:01:55,090
- This is an armrest.
- Armrest?

657
01:01:55,215 --> 01:01:58,510
Be even better
when the rest of the chair gets here.

658
01:02:06,101 --> 01:02:08,144
Hi, Katsumi, darling. How are you?

659
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:10,730
{y:i}- (speaks Japanese)
- Yeah.

660
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:27,997
It is very nice to have you... among us.

661
01:02:28,748 --> 01:02:31,626
It’s very nice to be among you too.

662
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:47,559
I brought a couple of things
you can stick round the house.

663
01:02:47,684 --> 01:02:51,354
- Yeah. Flowers.
{y:i}- (speaks Japanese)

664
01:02:53,565 --> 01:02:56,317
You’ve made her very happy, Ace.

665
01:02:57,235 --> 01:02:59,988
Are we gonna eat this or wear it?

666
01:03:00,113 --> 01:03:05,035
This is a little towel that they serve
before a meal or a drink.

667
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:09,581
- A little refresher for your hands and face.
- That’s a good idea.

668
01:03:09,706 --> 01:03:13,460
Wash ‘em off. OK, clean everywhere.

669
01:03:13,585 --> 01:03:15,628
Do I pass, teacher?

670
01:03:16,796 --> 01:03:19,049
Just dump it in the basket.

671
01:03:20,592 --> 01:03:22,302
Yes, sir.

672
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:23,845
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

673
01:03:23,970 --> 01:03:27,474
What’s this, an eye cup?
We got to wash our eyes out too?

674
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:31,394
No, that’s a cup for sake.
That’s a wine made out of rice.

675
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:34,272
- Rice? No fooling.
- No fooling.

676
01:03:34,397 --> 01:03:37,233
- I’ll try it.
- Taste it. You’ll see.

677
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:41,279
- Feels warm.
- We heat it up before we serve it.

678
01:03:43,823 --> 01:03:48,078
Katsumi, here’s to your house.
And, Kelly, very best to you.

679
01:03:48,203 --> 01:03:50,538
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

680
01:03:52,332 --> 01:03:56,294
- That’s all right, boy. Not bad.
- I told you. It’s wonderful.

681
01:03:56,419 --> 01:03:59,130
- You not gonna have anything?
- I was just gonna say.

682
01:03:59,255 --> 01:04:01,883
There’s kind of a polite thing you do.

683
01:04:02,008 --> 01:04:07,514
You take the cup, you swish it around
in the water and pour some sake for her.

684
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:09,683
- OK.
- That’s right.

685
01:04:12,268 --> 01:04:15,021
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

686
01:04:15,146 --> 01:04:17,732
- It means “a little bit”.
- All righty.

687
01:04:17,857 --> 01:04:20,735
Hold on now. Wait. OK.

688
01:04:25,156 --> 01:04:27,200
See? Didn’t hurt.

689
01:04:29,369 --> 01:04:31,996
She’s gonna get me
under the table in five minutes.

690
01:04:32,122 --> 01:04:37,127
She’ll keep pouring all night.
Katsumi, I pour for Gruver-san now.

691
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:42,424
You excuse me? I finish cooking.

692
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:47,178
You go ahead, darling.
Go right ahead. Go right ahead.

693
01:04:49,014 --> 01:04:51,057
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

694
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:57,564
A present. Whisky.

695
01:04:57,689 --> 01:04:59,733
Whisky?

696
01:05:14,372 --> 01:05:16,416
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

697
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:24,341
Listen, boy, she’s just as cute as a bug.
You ain’t gonna lose with her.

698
01:05:24,466 --> 01:05:28,970
See what I mean, Ace?
I’m the happiest guy in the world.

699
01:05:29,095 --> 01:05:31,723
- You wanna see the rest of the house?
- Yeah.

700
01:05:33,308 --> 01:05:35,560
I’ll show you round.

701
01:05:37,729 --> 01:05:41,024
This is the garden. Katsumi,
I’m showing him around the house.

702
01:05:41,149 --> 01:05:43,818
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

703
01:05:45,236 --> 01:05:49,282
The bathroom is back there. We got extra
rooms here. Would you like to see ‘em?

704
01:05:49,407 --> 01:05:51,451
Yeah.

705
01:05:52,744 --> 01:05:55,080
What you got here, boy?

706
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:56,456
Oh, lord:

707
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:05,256
We haven’t done anything with these yet
but maybe someday, if we expand.

708
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:07,967
It’s really working out for you, isn’t it?

709
01:06:08,093 --> 01:06:12,138
Everything’s perfect, except for
that rat of a colonel I’m assigned to.

710
01:06:12,263 --> 01:06:14,849
You wouldn’t be talking about Crawford?

711
01:06:14,974 --> 01:06:18,561
That’s the guy. He rides every guy
that’s married to a Japanese girl.

712
01:06:18,687 --> 01:06:21,064
Extra duty, everything.

713
01:06:21,189 --> 01:06:24,109
He’s a rough cob, no getting around that.

714
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:28,321
So what do I care? I come home to my girl
and I forget it. Let’s go.

715
01:06:28,446 --> 01:06:34,244
Wait. I forgot to ask you.
Does this Hana-ogi speak any English?

716
01:06:34,369 --> 01:06:36,871
Those girls sing in a lot of languages.

717
01:06:36,996 --> 01:06:40,125
I guess she’ll be able
to catch your drift, Ace.

718
01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:45,880
You nasty boy, you. Wait a minute.
I just got to take a look at my grass now.

719
01:06:46,006 --> 01:06:51,136
Are we gonna be, all four of us
gonna be together all evening long?

720
01:06:51,261 --> 01:06:54,931
Take it easy, Ace.
You’re gonna blow a fuse.

721
01:06:55,056 --> 01:06:57,100
Well...

722
01:06:58,893 --> 01:07:01,271
Might be.

723
01:07:01,396 --> 01:07:05,233
- Your lumber’s wrong.
- Watch your head, Ace.

724
01:07:08,361 --> 01:07:10,405
Katsumi, you ready?

725
01:07:11,698 --> 01:07:14,951
In here? You gonna have to change...

726
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:24,794
Kelly.

727
01:07:33,386 --> 01:07:37,515
Hana-ogi-san.
This is a great day for our house.

728
01:07:39,392 --> 01:07:41,436
Major Gruver-san.

729
01:07:41,561 --> 01:07:43,605
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

730
01:07:44,439 --> 01:07:46,483
How do you do, Miss Ogi?

731
01:07:48,485 --> 01:07:52,906
- Where you going?
- I gotta help Katsumi with the...

732
01:07:57,410 --> 01:08:02,916
It looks as though everybody’s ran off
and left us alone here.

733
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:07,253
Certainly was nice of you
to come over here this evening, Miss Ogi.

734
01:08:07,379 --> 01:08:12,967
I was just tickled to death
when they told me you were coming over.

735
01:08:14,344 --> 01:08:16,388
I’ll just sit down here.

736
01:08:20,266 --> 01:08:22,310
Well, Miss Ogi.

737
01:08:23,728 --> 01:08:26,189
Let me fix you a little drink.

738
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:30,276
No, not... Well, OK.

739
01:08:37,283 --> 01:08:39,327
Here’s to you.

740
01:08:41,496 --> 01:08:47,043
It’s good. Don’t tell me. I know you’ve got
to slosh this around in here a little bit

741
01:08:47,168 --> 01:08:51,673
and get the dribble off
and give it right back to you.

742
01:08:51,798 --> 01:08:53,842
Now you take that.

743
01:08:56,553 --> 01:08:58,596
All right.

744
01:09:02,976 --> 01:09:06,646
I was surprised to find
that they make that stuff out of rice.

745
01:09:06,771 --> 01:09:09,816
We have rice back home in America.

746
01:09:09,941 --> 01:09:13,778
We just make rice pudding out of it.
We don’t drink it.

747
01:09:13,903 --> 01:09:17,615
This is the first liquid rice I’ve ran into.

748
01:09:26,332 --> 01:09:28,376
You know, did...

749
01:09:29,586 --> 01:09:34,716
Did anyone ever tell you, Miss Ogi,
that you’re a fine-looking woman?

750
01:09:34,841 --> 01:09:36,885
I mean, really fine.

751
01:09:38,636 --> 01:09:44,434
You’re even better looking offstage
than you are on. That’s the truth.

752
01:09:44,559 --> 01:09:48,021
You get up there and sing,
dance, act, everything.

753
01:09:48,146 --> 01:09:50,273
You’re all-round great.

754
01:09:56,654 --> 01:10:02,035
I wonder where Kelly and Katsumi...
I’m getting kinda hungry again.

755
01:10:07,374 --> 01:10:09,417
Look, Miss Ogi...

756
01:10:11,086 --> 01:10:16,591
I’m not up to Japanese ways of doing
things. Maybe I’m saying the wrong thing.

757
01:10:16,716 --> 01:10:20,762
Maybe my American manners
are embarrassing.

758
01:10:20,887 --> 01:10:23,390
But I figured,
as you came over here tonight,

759
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:26,559
maybe you were interested
a little bit in meeting me too.

760
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:34,526
Maybe I’m wrong, but if I’m wrong, then
you got to tell me where we go from here.

761
01:10:35,276 --> 01:10:39,406
Cos I don’t know what to say.
I’m runnin’ out of things to say.

762
01:10:43,243 --> 01:10:49,916
My father was killed by American bomb
dropped on my country.

763
01:10:51,418 --> 01:10:53,878
You have been my enemy.

764
01:10:56,006 --> 01:10:58,591
I have hated Americans.

765
01:10:58,717 --> 01:11:01,594
I have thought they are savages.

766
01:11:03,054 --> 01:11:06,766
There has been nothing
but vengeance in my heart.

767
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:12,689
Miss Ogi, there were an awful lot
of Americans that were killed too.

768
01:11:14,149 --> 01:11:17,652
I think it would be best
if we forgot about that.

769
01:11:19,404 --> 01:11:23,116
You have been watching me at the bridge.

770
01:11:23,241 --> 01:11:25,285
Watching me dance.

771
01:11:26,953 --> 01:11:30,457
Watching me
as I go back to the dormitory.

772
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,878
But I have been watching you too.

773
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:39,883
And you have not looked like a savage.

774
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,970
And when Katsumi-san told me
how gently you kissed her

775
01:11:44,095 --> 01:11:47,390
the day she became a bride,

776
01:11:47,515 --> 01:11:51,644
how tenderly you kissed
my sweet little friend,

777
01:11:53,146 --> 01:11:56,524
I realised the hate was of my own making.

778
01:11:58,693 --> 01:12:03,198
That is why I came
to ask you to forgive me

779
01:12:03,323 --> 01:12:05,784
for what I have been feeling.

780
01:12:07,869 --> 01:12:10,705
Gruver-san, will you forgive me?

781
01:12:15,043 --> 01:12:18,838
You make me feel
like an awful fool, Miss Ogi.

782
01:12:21,132 --> 01:12:25,095
I really feel that
I oughta ask you to forgive me

783
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:30,266
for some of the things that...
I’ve been thinking.

784
01:12:33,645 --> 01:12:38,900
I come from the north of Japan
and my father was a farmer.

785
01:12:39,025 --> 01:12:41,736
There were nine children.

786
01:12:41,861 --> 01:12:44,572
And we were very poor.

787
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:48,743
There are too many people
in my crowded country.

788
01:12:48,868 --> 01:12:52,288
I took the examination at Matsubayashi

789
01:12:52,414 --> 01:12:55,083
and now I am first dancer of all.

790
01:12:56,710 --> 01:13:01,256
When I’m too old to dance,
I will become head teacher.

791
01:13:03,758 --> 01:13:06,594
My life is planned.

792
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:10,015
I am dedicated to Matsubayashi,

793
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:14,269
as you are dedicated
to American military life.

794
01:13:16,688 --> 01:13:19,357
I have never been in love...

795
01:13:20,525 --> 01:13:24,779
but I have dreamed and thought about it...

796
01:13:25,905 --> 01:13:27,949
and waited.

797
01:13:30,952 --> 01:13:35,665
The danger that lies ahead of us,
we must face now.

798
01:13:38,001 --> 01:13:41,296
The danger of discovery for both of us.

799
01:13:42,964 --> 01:13:47,510
The danger of weakness when it is over.

800
01:13:54,684 --> 01:13:57,354
I will never fall in love again.

801
01:13:59,522 --> 01:14:05,737
But I will love you, if that is your desire.

802
01:14:26,591 --> 01:14:29,135
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

803
01:14:47,570 --> 01:14:49,614
How do you do?

804
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:56,079
- Miss Webster.
- Hello.

805
01:14:58,081 --> 01:15:01,418
- Mr Nakamura, how nice of you to come.
- It is a great pleasure.

806
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:04,462
And may I say that you look
especially beautiful today.

807
01:15:04,587 --> 01:15:07,257
I haven’t been
to this month’s kabuki programme.

808
01:15:07,382 --> 01:15:10,093
I know. You see, I have been waiting.

809
01:15:10,218 --> 01:15:13,805
- Eileen.
- Mother, you remember Mr Nakamura.

810
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:16,641
- How do you do, Mrs Webster?
- Yes, of course.

811
01:15:16,766 --> 01:15:19,310
This party isn’t given especially for you.

812
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:23,356
You’ve got to circulate around
and cement Japanese-American relations.

813
01:15:23,481 --> 01:15:27,277
That’s exactly what
Mr Nakamura and I are doing.

814
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:32,699
Nakamura-san, my little girl wants
your autograph. She admires you so.

815
01:15:32,824 --> 01:15:37,579
- Of course. Will you please excuse me?
- Yes, of course.

816
01:15:39,664 --> 01:15:41,916
Has Lloyd come yet?

817
01:15:42,042 --> 01:15:44,794
How many weeks
are you gonna keep on pretending?

818
01:15:44,919 --> 01:15:49,215
- Lloyd is not coming.
- I’m absolutely furious at him.

819
01:15:49,341 --> 01:15:53,511
How can he ignore the general’s
invitation? I had it delivered to his office.

820
01:15:53,636 --> 01:15:57,974
I’m stuck with that Farrington woman.
Can you help me out?

821
01:15:59,559 --> 01:16:04,647
Uh-oh. There’s Crawford. Whenever
he shows up, there’s always something.

822
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:07,650
Can I speak to you alone
for a minute, General?

823
01:16:07,776 --> 01:16:13,073
Major, do you have that list with you?
I want to see if the Williams have come.

824
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:14,657
Yes, they have.

825
01:16:16,701 --> 01:16:18,745
Waiter. Could you leave?

826
01:16:22,874 --> 01:16:27,462
The reason I took this up with you
is because it concerns Major Gruver.

827
01:16:27,587 --> 01:16:31,174
We think he’s hooked
onto a Japanese dame.

828
01:16:31,299 --> 01:16:34,094
I’m sorry, but this thing’s
gotten me all riled up.

829
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:37,097
Do you realise what it’ll mean
to the enlisted men

830
01:16:37,222 --> 01:16:40,392
if they find out that their big hero,
Ace Gruver, is out with...

831
01:16:40,517 --> 01:16:45,021
I’ve known Major Gruver all his life.
I’m a close friend of his father’s.

832
01:16:45,146 --> 01:16:48,566
- I assure you, you must be wrong.
- He was seen going into that house.

833
01:16:48,692 --> 01:16:51,986
My men have been watching
a troublemaker named Kelly.

834
01:16:52,112 --> 01:16:56,783
- He’s shacked up with another native...
- Kelly’s married to a Japanese girl.

835
01:16:56,908 --> 01:17:01,121
Major Gruver was the best man. It seems
quite natural to me that he’d visit them.

836
01:17:01,246 --> 01:17:04,332
- How am I gonna handle the situation?
- Don’t handle it.

837
01:17:04,457 --> 01:17:07,002
I trust Major Gruver implicitly.

838
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:10,171
Is it all right with you if I post an order

839
01:17:10,296 --> 01:17:16,052
to keep these officers from being seen
with indigenous personnel?

840
01:17:16,177 --> 01:17:18,555
If they are seen,
there’s something we can do.

841
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,848
All right.

842
01:17:43,455 --> 01:17:44,706
Lloyd.

843
01:17:59,137 --> 01:18:01,181
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

844
01:18:06,853 --> 01:18:09,314
No one saw you come?

845
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:14,486
No, there’s no military personnel
around here. Except me.

846
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:20,450
- We must go to the tea ceremony.
- Yeah, I know.

847
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:23,661
Good afternoon.

848
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:32,962
All this getting up and down like to kill me.

849
01:19:05,286 --> 01:19:08,873
He makes such a production
of everything.

850
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:13,586
The pleasure does not lie in the end itself.

851
01:19:13,712 --> 01:19:16,965
It’s the pleasurable steps to that end.

852
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:19,134
I see.

853
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:46,036
{y:i}(hums)

854
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,664
- That you, Ace?
- Yeah, Kelly.

855
01:19:50,582 --> 01:19:53,877
- Come on in here.
- I can’t right now.

856
01:19:55,462 --> 01:19:58,715
He’d be surprised you come in this way.

857
01:19:58,840 --> 01:20:01,217
He’d faint.

858
01:20:01,343 --> 01:20:05,305
Just a little lower, Katsumi.
You always seem to be a little above it.

859
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:07,724
Yeah, that’s it. Yeah, yeah.

860
01:20:15,315 --> 01:20:17,150
"(? jazz on radio)"

861
01:20:18,735 --> 01:20:21,071
Kelly-san, now you get in tub?

862
01:20:21,196 --> 01:20:23,239
OK, all right.

863
01:20:24,491 --> 01:20:28,870
- Is Hana-ogi coming over tonight?
- Yeah, if she can get away.

864
01:20:28,995 --> 01:20:35,210
We gonna cook up some fine St Louis
goulash with a little Memphis greens.

865
01:20:39,047 --> 01:20:43,218
What are you doing tonight after dinner
when Hana-ogi goes back to the theatre?

866
01:20:43,343 --> 01:20:44,761
"(Gruver)" Nothing.

867
01:20:44,886 --> 01:20:47,472
How about playing poker
with Katsumi and me?

868
01:20:47,597 --> 01:20:52,018
"(Gruver)" I’d be delighted
to take your money, and your pants.

869
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:56,981
This is the life, ain’t it, Ace?

870
01:20:57,107 --> 01:20:58,942
{y:i}(whistIes to radio)

871
01:21:34,894 --> 01:21:36,938
There you are.

872
01:21:42,027 --> 01:21:44,070
How d’you do?

873
01:21:56,916 --> 01:21:59,336
I got one word for you.

874
01:21:59,461 --> 01:22:01,921
- What is that?
- Food.

875
01:22:15,101 --> 01:22:19,731
? Sayonara

876
01:22:19,856 --> 01:22:24,319
? Japanese goodbye

877
01:22:24,444 --> 01:22:29,366
? Whisper “Sayonara”

878
01:22:29,491 --> 01:22:33,536
? Lover, don’t you cry

879
01:22:34,788 --> 01:22:39,626
? No more we stop to see

880
01:22:39,751 --> 01:22:43,421
? Pretty cherry blossom

881
01:22:44,714 --> 01:22:49,636
? No more we ‘neath the tree

882
01:22:49,761 --> 01:22:53,431
? Looking at the sky

883
01:22:54,474 --> 01:22:59,187
? Sayonara

884
01:22:59,729 --> 01:23:04,609
? Sayonara

885
01:23:04,734 --> 01:23:09,698
? Goodbye

886
01:23:10,448 --> 01:23:13,034
{y:i}(taps bowl in applause)

887
01:23:13,159 --> 01:23:16,121
That’s the cutest thing I ever saw, honey.

888
01:23:16,246 --> 01:23:18,289
I must go.

889
01:23:19,749 --> 01:23:22,752
Ooh: Good eatin’.

890
01:23:24,462 --> 01:23:25,463
Bye-bye.

891
01:23:25,588 --> 01:23:29,050
Are you going back
to the officers’ quarters tonight?

892
01:23:29,175 --> 01:23:32,387
No, I think I’m gonna just
fool around here.

893
01:23:32,512 --> 01:23:34,806
What will you do all evening?

894
01:23:34,931 --> 01:23:38,560
What am I gonna do?
I’m gonna get some beer, pretzels, girls.

895
01:23:38,685 --> 01:23:41,021
I’m gonna have a little fun for a change.

896
01:23:41,146 --> 01:23:44,315
Good. I don’t like you to be lonely.

897
01:23:50,405 --> 01:23:52,449
Take care.

898
01:24:14,596 --> 01:24:16,222
{y:i}(knocking)

899
01:24:16,348 --> 01:24:18,391
Come on in, Katsumi.

900
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:26,191
I’m sorry, Lloyd.
I had to come. It’s important.

901
01:24:26,316 --> 01:24:28,360
Hello, Eileen.

902
01:24:31,696 --> 01:24:34,366
How are you?

903
01:24:34,491 --> 01:24:37,118
Sit down, will you?

904
01:24:37,243 --> 01:24:42,123
I’ll take this stuff out the way.
I was just gettin’ a little...

905
01:24:49,381 --> 01:24:51,424
Sit down here.

906
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:57,263
How are you?

907
01:25:05,647 --> 01:25:09,359
- They’re after you, Lloyd.
- Who’s after me?

908
01:25:09,484 --> 01:25:13,321
There’s a colonel. His name’s Crawford.

909
01:25:13,446 --> 01:25:15,490
Oh, yeah.

910
01:25:16,991 --> 01:25:19,119
I know him.

911
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:22,789
He’s the one that’s riding Kelly.
This is Kelly’s house.

912
01:25:22,914 --> 01:25:24,958
Yes, I know.

913
01:25:27,043 --> 01:25:31,715
- You want to hear this, don’t you, Lloyd?
- Yeah, sure. Course I do.

914
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:37,512
I overheard Colonel Crawford say
that he’s been having this house watched,

915
01:25:37,637 --> 01:25:42,934
hoping to catch Kelly
at something irregular, I suppose.

916
01:25:43,059 --> 01:25:45,603
Anyhow, that’s how I knew where it was.

917
01:25:45,729 --> 01:25:51,276
Well, then they... they’ve seen me
coming in and out of here.

918
01:25:51,401 --> 01:25:53,445
Yes.

919
01:25:55,405 --> 01:25:58,366
I just felt that I had to tell you...

920
01:26:03,788 --> 01:26:05,832
Eileen...

921
01:26:07,334 --> 01:26:09,544
There’s something that I feel that...

922
01:26:09,669 --> 01:26:17,469
I must go, Lloyd. I just wanted to warn you
to be particularly careful about...

923
01:26:17,594 --> 01:26:19,637
About what, honey?

924
01:26:22,432 --> 01:26:26,853
About sticking strictly
to military regulations.

925
01:26:26,978 --> 01:26:30,148
Lloyd, they’ll do anything
to hang something on you,

926
01:26:30,273 --> 01:26:32,317
to keep you in line.

927
01:26:34,736 --> 01:26:39,366
After all, you’re the air force’s
pin-up boy, you know.

928
01:26:41,493 --> 01:26:45,830
Colonel Crawford sounded
as if he was after blood.

929
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:56,299
- More than anything I could think of...
- I must go now, Lloyd. Good luck.

930
01:26:56,424 --> 01:26:59,386
Wait a minute. Let me help you.

931
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,765
Eileen, I know...

932
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:10,730
Lloyd, you’ve really thought seriously
about what you’re doing, haven’t you?

933
01:27:13,233 --> 01:27:15,694
Yes, I...

934
01:27:15,819 --> 01:27:17,821
I think I have.

935
01:27:17,946 --> 01:27:19,989
I hope so.

936
01:27:21,866 --> 01:27:26,579
You’ve a brilliant record in the air force.
People depend upon you.

937
01:27:26,705 --> 01:27:32,502
Before you throw all that you’ve worked
for away, be sure. Please be sure.

938
01:27:35,922 --> 01:27:42,804
Eileen, I don’t think if I had a million years
that I could tell you how all this happened.

939
01:27:45,932 --> 01:27:48,643
I’d better go before I lose all my charm.

940
01:28:17,797 --> 01:28:20,842
Do you like this old curious play?

941
01:28:22,344 --> 01:28:26,181
Yeah, I’m beginning to get a kick out of it.

942
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:35,690
- See the rope between the rocks?
- Yeah.

943
01:28:35,815 --> 01:28:39,235
That is a Shinto sign
showing they are married.

944
01:28:39,361 --> 01:28:41,446
- What, the rocks?
- Yes.

945
01:28:41,571 --> 01:28:45,867
They’ve been together so long, our people
thought it was time they got married.

946
01:28:45,992 --> 01:28:51,623
- They look well together, don’t you think?
- Yeah. Make a handsome little couple.

947
01:28:51,748 --> 01:28:53,667
Do you like my country?

948
01:28:53,792 --> 01:28:57,796
Yeah, was all these funny things here
before when I came through Japan?

949
01:28:57,921 --> 01:28:59,964
Yes.

950
01:29:09,766 --> 01:29:13,019
- Well, hello.
- Hello there, double-double ugly.

951
01:29:13,144 --> 01:29:15,772
To what do we owe
the honour of this visit?

952
01:29:15,897 --> 01:29:20,944
Laundry. Gonna put down the dirties
and pick up the cleans.

953
01:29:24,406 --> 01:29:27,242
I hope you know what you’re doing.

954
01:29:27,367 --> 01:29:29,828
This came in.
Thought you might like to see it.

955
01:29:29,953 --> 01:29:34,499
”This is a routine reminder of
the recent orders issued by Camp Kobe:”

956
01:29:34,624 --> 01:29:38,211
”Any public display of affection
for a Japanese national

957
01:29:38,336 --> 01:29:40,630
by a member of this command
is forbidden.”

958
01:29:40,755 --> 01:29:43,508
”Officers should not even
appear on public streets

959
01:29:43,633 --> 01:29:47,220
accompanied by indigenous
female personnel.”

960
01:29:47,345 --> 01:29:51,349
- Hooray for Christmas.
- This is serious. Everybody got one.

961
01:29:51,474 --> 01:29:55,311
Listen, fool, Hana-ogi and I
are just as careful as we can be.

962
01:29:55,437 --> 01:29:59,482
We never go anyplace where we’re gonna
be seen by anybody that matters.

963
01:29:59,607 --> 01:30:02,485
We don’t even walk down the same street.

964
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:06,031
We just go out in the country
and fool around.

965
01:30:06,156 --> 01:30:09,826
You’ve never been to the country
around here, have you?

966
01:30:09,951 --> 01:30:13,204
Awful pretty country round here. I mean it.

967
01:30:13,913 --> 01:30:18,209
You know what I saw yesterday?
I saw two rocks that just got married.

968
01:30:18,335 --> 01:30:21,796
- You what?
- I saw two rocks that got married.

969
01:30:21,921 --> 01:30:25,508
- And they looked very happy together too.
- I’ll bet they did.

970
01:30:25,633 --> 01:30:31,181
They did. If you were gonna be smart,
I’ll tell you what you’d do.

971
01:30:31,306 --> 01:30:33,725
You’d get your shoes shined
and go out tonight,

972
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:36,686
cos tonight is gonna be Tanabata.

973
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:39,564
OK, what’s Tanabata?

974
01:30:40,690 --> 01:30:44,694
You’re gonna sit there and tell me
you don’t know what Tanabata is?

975
01:30:44,819 --> 01:30:46,279
Yeah.

976
01:30:46,404 --> 01:30:48,740
My word, boy. I’m ashamed of you.

977
01:30:48,865 --> 01:30:51,534
I thought everybody knew
what Tanabata was.

978
01:30:51,659 --> 01:30:54,329
Tanabata is the night of love.

979
01:30:54,454 --> 01:30:56,873
You told me all about it one time.

980
01:30:56,998 --> 01:31:02,295
You were telling me about Harry Truman
and New York Yankees and sex,

981
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:05,507
and New York Yankees
and Harry Truman and sex.

982
01:31:05,632 --> 01:31:07,676
{y:i}(mumbles)

983
01:31:24,734 --> 01:31:28,196
What have I done
to deserve such happiness?

984
01:31:28,321 --> 01:31:33,827
I have seen this night of Tanabata
come and go many times,

985
01:31:33,952 --> 01:31:38,164
but never before
have I understood what it meant.

986
01:31:39,249 --> 01:31:41,793
Tanabata.

987
01:31:41,918 --> 01:31:45,005
My heart is so full of love for you.

988
01:31:58,184 --> 01:32:00,228
{y:i}(drumming)

989
01:32:20,165 --> 01:32:22,208
{y:i}(shouts in Japanese)

990
01:32:29,174 --> 01:32:31,217
- Miss Webster?
- Yes?

991
01:32:31,343 --> 01:32:35,430
Nakamura-san get your note.
Here is reply.

992
01:32:35,555 --> 01:32:39,601
He wishes if you will have dinner
with him and his guests.

993
01:32:39,726 --> 01:32:41,770
Thank you very much.

994
01:33:11,383 --> 01:33:16,554
They have a rather pleasant
garden here, Miss Webster.

995
01:33:18,014 --> 01:33:21,768
- Would you like to see it?
- Yes, I think I would.

996
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:40,704
{y:i}(singing in Japanese)

997
01:33:46,251 --> 01:33:48,712
How beautiful.

998
01:33:56,928 --> 01:33:59,889
What are you really afraid of,
Miss Webster?

999
01:34:00,015 --> 01:34:05,812
You don’t think it would enter Major
Gruver’s mind to marry a Japanese girl?

1000
01:34:07,564 --> 01:34:09,607
I don’t know.

1001
01:34:09,733 --> 01:34:12,360
Then permit me to reassure you.

1002
01:34:12,485 --> 01:34:17,991
I think Major Gruver is brave,
but not brave enough to face the censure

1003
01:34:18,116 --> 01:34:20,952
that would result from such a marriage.

1004
01:34:21,077 --> 01:34:25,165
As for our famous, honoured Hana-ogi,

1005
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:29,252
there are many Japanese -
most of them, in fact -

1006
01:34:29,377 --> 01:34:31,671
who look upon marriage to an Occidental

1007
01:34:31,796 --> 01:34:36,009
with as much distaste
as your people do to one of us.

1008
01:34:37,135 --> 01:34:39,846
I do not feel that way,

1009
01:34:39,971 --> 01:34:43,516
but then I have had the privilege
of travelling in your country

1010
01:34:43,641 --> 01:34:47,437
and knowing some great people there.

1011
01:34:47,562 --> 01:34:51,399
And I am especially conscious
at this moment

1012
01:34:51,524 --> 01:34:56,654
that beauty is not confined
to any one race.

1013
01:35:00,241 --> 01:35:02,577
Do not turn away, Miss Webster.

1014
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
 

1015
01:35:02,702 --> 01:35:07,957
I am not necessarily making love to you.

1016
01:35:11,211 --> 01:35:15,965
I am only stating a very obvious fact.

1017
01:35:18,343 --> 01:35:21,096
May I see you again, Miss Webster,

1018
01:35:21,221 --> 01:35:24,974
and acquaint you with more Japan?

1019
01:35:26,017 --> 01:35:27,852
Of course.

1020
01:35:27,977 --> 01:35:32,565
I need to know more, much more,
about everything.

1021
01:35:53,628 --> 01:35:55,672
There she is.

1022
01:35:57,590 --> 01:35:59,634
Hello, honey.

1023
01:36:11,688 --> 01:36:13,732
Are you tired?

1024
01:36:15,900 --> 01:36:21,072
No, I just been lying here
thinking about myself.

1025
01:36:22,240 --> 01:36:24,993
I can’t believe I’m really here.

1026
01:36:25,994 --> 01:36:30,248
It’s hard to believe
me being the same Lloyd Gruver

1027
01:36:30,373 --> 01:36:34,502
that came over from Korea
just a little bit ago.

1028
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:43,136
I’ve been thinking
that all my life I’ve been so busy...

1029
01:36:44,095 --> 01:36:47,057
snapping to and giving orders
and taking orders

1030
01:36:47,182 --> 01:36:52,645
and being a general’s son
and doing the job and all that,

1031
01:36:52,771 --> 01:36:56,691
I just never took time
to sit right down and...

1032
01:36:58,068 --> 01:37:02,405
you know, think about
what my reason for living is.

1033
01:37:05,033 --> 01:37:09,079
And I’ve been spending
some afternoons here just...

1034
01:37:09,204 --> 01:37:13,833
bein’ peaceful and easy and thinking.

1035
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:19,631
And I believe for the first time I...

1036
01:37:21,257 --> 01:37:26,930
I’m just beginning to understand
what it’s all about,

1037
01:37:28,723 --> 01:37:32,602
what I really am and what I really want.

1038
01:37:32,727 --> 01:37:34,771
It’s a nice feeling.

1039
01:37:41,027 --> 01:37:43,071
{y:i}(knocking)

1040
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:46,449
Come on in.

1041
01:37:46,574 --> 01:37:49,494
Ace, excuse me. I hate to bother you.

1042
01:37:49,619 --> 01:37:52,747
- I just got the news.
- You got what news?

1043
01:37:52,872 --> 01:37:57,043
- I’m gettin’ shipped back.
- You’re being shipped back where?

1044
01:37:57,168 --> 01:38:01,172
Stateside. I’ve been reassigned
to a new duty station.

1045
01:38:03,299 --> 01:38:05,927
Well...

1046
01:38:06,052 --> 01:38:08,513
- Did you tell Katsumi yet?
- No.

1047
01:38:08,638 --> 01:38:11,349
Don’t tell her.
Maybe we can work something out.

1048
01:38:11,474 --> 01:38:14,894
What reason did they give you for it?

1049
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:18,481
No reason. But I know what it is.

1050
01:38:18,606 --> 01:38:23,028
Every guy on that list
is married to a Japanese girl.

1051
01:38:26,906 --> 01:38:30,827
I’m sorry, Major.
There’s nothing you can do.

1052
01:38:33,246 --> 01:38:38,501
We’re sending Kelly to the States
Thursday, and that’s that.

1053
01:38:39,419 --> 01:38:42,213
What about his wife, Colonel?

1054
01:38:42,339 --> 01:38:44,382
She stays here.

1055
01:38:45,300 --> 01:38:49,220
He knew he couldn’t take her back
with him when he married her.

1056
01:38:49,346 --> 01:38:52,015
- Didn’t you?
- That’s right.

1057
01:38:53,475 --> 01:38:55,727
You’d be busting up his home, then.

1058
01:38:55,852 --> 01:38:58,313
I’m not busting up anything.

1059
01:39:00,065 --> 01:39:04,486
Though I admit Kelly’s been
a pain in my side for quite a while now.

1060
01:39:04,611 --> 01:39:08,907
Could you tell me why he didn’t have
the privilege of extending his tour of duty?

1061
01:39:09,032 --> 01:39:14,662
Don’t ask me, Major. There are lots
of reasons for these things.

1062
01:39:14,788 --> 01:39:20,502
Anyway, it is an order
and there’s nothing you can do about it,

1063
01:39:20,627 --> 01:39:24,172
even if you are a four-star general’s son.

1064
01:39:24,297 --> 01:39:26,341
Yeah, well...

1065
01:39:28,968 --> 01:39:35,475
Would it make any difference if I told you
my wife’s gonna have a baby?

1066
01:39:36,142 --> 01:39:38,603
That’s tough, I admit.

1067
01:39:40,647 --> 01:39:44,901
Colonel, under these circumstances,
don’t you think that you’d be able to

1068
01:39:45,026 --> 01:39:47,904
postpone this for a little while?

1069
01:39:48,029 --> 01:39:51,157
Maybe I could be transferred
back to Korea.

1070
01:39:51,282 --> 01:39:53,326
No, you’re going home.

1071
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:58,998
All the boys on this list are going home.

1072
01:40:00,208 --> 01:40:04,045
- Where is your home?
- That house by the canal.

1073
01:40:05,171 --> 01:40:08,341
- I mean your real home.
- That house by the canal.

1074
01:40:08,466 --> 01:40:10,510
Yeah, all right.

1075
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:16,808
I’ve taken all the insubordination
from you I intend to.

1076
01:40:16,933 --> 01:40:19,811
Now, you listen to me, wise guy.

1077
01:40:19,936 --> 01:40:24,482
That house by the canal
is off limits from now on.

1078
01:40:25,692 --> 01:40:28,319
Whole street’s off limits.

1079
01:40:28,445 --> 01:40:31,156
Do you want a court martial?

1080
01:40:31,281 --> 01:40:33,533
Does that mean I could stay in Japan?

1081
01:40:33,658 --> 01:40:37,996
You’re shipping outta here on Thursday.
And don’t you try to help him.

1082
01:40:40,331 --> 01:40:45,795
Remember that house by the canal
is off limits to all personnel.

1083
01:40:47,547 --> 01:40:51,593
Would you tell me just exactly
what you mean by that last remark?

1084
01:40:51,718 --> 01:40:55,055
That’s all I’m prepared
to say at the minute.

1085
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:57,932
Except you watch your step.

1086
01:41:02,771 --> 01:41:07,025
I don’t know what else to tell you,
General. I’ve known this boy a long time.

1087
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:11,988
If he has to go back without Katsumi,
he’s gonna be in trouble.

1088
01:41:12,113 --> 01:41:14,824
That’s about it. That’s it.

1089
01:41:14,949 --> 01:41:17,494
- What about his wife?
- I don’t know.

1090
01:41:17,619 --> 01:41:19,287
And the baby?

1091
01:41:21,331 --> 01:41:26,211
So the army lets them get married and
then forces them to desert their wives.

1092
01:41:26,336 --> 01:41:29,130
That’s not fair, Eileen.

1093
01:41:29,255 --> 01:41:32,759
A boy away from home
for the first time, lonesome,

1094
01:41:32,884 --> 01:41:35,470
often falls in love
with the first girl he touches,

1095
01:41:35,595 --> 01:41:38,598
in most cases with a girl from the streets.

1096
01:41:38,723 --> 01:41:44,813
It’s up to the service in some measure
to be fathers and mothers to these boys

1097
01:41:44,938 --> 01:41:47,899
and try to head off these marriages.

1098
01:41:48,024 --> 01:41:50,443
But after they’re married,
why send them home?

1099
01:41:50,568 --> 01:41:54,239
He’s being transferred to a new
duty station, along with many others.

1100
01:41:54,364 --> 01:41:59,202
Don’t ask me the reasons for changes
of duty. There are thousands of them.

1101
01:41:59,327 --> 01:42:03,331
But Lloyd said most of the men on this list
are married to Japanese girls.

1102
01:42:03,456 --> 01:42:08,503
- That can’t be just a coincidence.
- Why not? It could easily be.

1103
01:42:08,628 --> 01:42:14,259
Frankly, with some of these men,
I think they might welcome the transfer.

1104
01:42:14,384 --> 01:42:16,219
Why’s that, sir?

1105
01:42:16,344 --> 01:42:19,848
There have been unfortunate aftermaths
to many of these marriages.

1106
01:42:19,973 --> 01:42:22,434
Recriminations, regrets.

1107
01:42:23,768 --> 01:42:28,440
A boy gets married impulsively, then feels
caught, doesn’t know how to get out of it.

1108
01:42:28,565 --> 01:42:33,528
Change of duty gives them both
a chance to think it over, to cool off.

1109
01:42:33,653 --> 01:42:38,950
I don’t mean to imply that’s the reason
these men are being transferred but...

1110
01:42:39,075 --> 01:42:44,914
well, the whole thing’s a messy business.

1111
01:42:46,833 --> 01:42:51,463
General Webster, there is no regret
in the case of Kelly and Katsumi.

1112
01:42:51,588 --> 01:42:53,798
You can have my word on that.

1113
01:42:53,923 --> 01:43:00,388
Lloyd, three officers came to me today
with identical requests for their men.

1114
01:43:00,513 --> 01:43:04,768
It’s not our policy to interfere with
decisions made by commanding officers.

1115
01:43:04,893 --> 01:43:10,857
The basic structure of the military service
would collapse if we did things like that.

1116
01:43:10,982 --> 01:43:14,569
Your father would understand that,
even if you don’t.

1117
01:43:14,694 --> 01:43:22,035
You’re asking me to make an exception of
Kelly when I’ve refused these other men?

1118
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:24,913
I am gonna ask you to do that, sir.

1119
01:43:26,373 --> 01:43:31,336
You made an exception of me
when you brought me from Korea.

1120
01:43:32,253 --> 01:43:36,174
I’m afraid it’s a hopeless situation, Lloyd.

1121
01:43:40,679 --> 01:43:42,722
Well...

1122
01:43:44,015 --> 01:43:46,976
That’s the end of Joe Kelly.

1123
01:43:47,102 --> 01:43:50,563
You told me yourself that Kelly’s
past record was against him.

1124
01:43:50,689 --> 01:43:52,524
I couldn’t even use that.

1125
01:43:52,649 --> 01:43:55,360
Why does this mean
so much to you, Lloyd?

1126
01:43:57,404 --> 01:44:01,908
Kelly’s from my outfit, Mrs Webster,
I was his best man,

1127
01:44:02,033 --> 01:44:06,121
and I’m planning to marry
a Japanese girl myself.

1128
01:44:09,749 --> 01:44:14,671
Come into the other room, Eileen. This is
something for your father to handle.

1129
01:44:14,796 --> 01:44:19,175
No, Mrs Webster. I don’t think
this is anything for anybody to handle.

1130
01:44:24,973 --> 01:44:27,017
I’m sorry, Eileen.

1131
01:44:31,855 --> 01:44:34,816
Mrs Webster. Good afternoon.

1132
01:44:41,573 --> 01:44:46,578
I don’t think I’ll ever love anyone again
as much as I love Lloyd.

1133
01:44:46,703 --> 01:44:50,457
But I’ll tell you something
that’s rather ironic.

1134
01:44:50,582 --> 01:44:53,877
I once asked Lloyd
if he ever felt like grabbing me

1135
01:44:54,002 --> 01:44:58,131
and hauling me off to a shack somewhere.

1136
01:44:58,256 --> 01:45:03,470
That’s just what he’s done, isn’t it?
Only it’s with somebody else.

1137
01:45:03,595 --> 01:45:06,806
Don’t go out, Eileen. Stay and talk.

1138
01:45:06,931 --> 01:45:11,019
I’m sorry, Mother. There’s only one
person I’d like to talk to at the moment.

1139
01:45:11,144 --> 01:45:14,105
And, oddly enough, he’s Japanese.

1140
01:45:18,234 --> 01:45:21,696
- Ace, I’ve been waiting for you.
- Kelly, listen.

1141
01:45:21,821 --> 01:45:26,493
I just came from General Webster’s
house. There’s a whole big mess there.

1142
01:45:26,618 --> 01:45:31,623
- No good, huh?
- No. He didn’t go for it.

1143
01:45:31,748 --> 01:45:36,002
Matter of fact, I think
I even messed it up a little.

1144
01:45:36,127 --> 01:45:38,213
That figures.

1145
01:45:38,338 --> 01:45:40,465
Did you tell Katsumi yet?

1146
01:45:41,925 --> 01:45:44,260
I’m chickening out fast.

1147
01:45:44,386 --> 01:45:48,098
Besides, she’s got her heart set
on something she planned for us tonight.

1148
01:45:48,223 --> 01:45:53,687
Wants us to take the train over to Osaka
and meet the girls at the puppet show.

1149
01:45:53,812 --> 01:45:55,855
Why spoil it?

1150
01:45:57,607 --> 01:46:02,070
Maybe I’ll tell her late tonight
when we’re alone.

1151
01:46:02,195 --> 01:46:06,574
Listen, Kelly, don’t give up on it.
I think there’s gonna be a way out of it.

1152
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:09,160
You think so? I don’t.

1153
01:46:11,162 --> 01:46:13,915
- I’ll see you, Ace.
- Kelly-san.

1154
01:46:15,041 --> 01:46:18,962
Tell Katsumi we’ll be there with bells.

1155
01:46:19,087 --> 01:46:21,131
Were you able to help?

1156
01:46:24,300 --> 01:46:27,053
- No.
- How terrible.

1157
01:46:31,641 --> 01:46:35,061
I know it’s hard, honey,
but it’s not gonna last long.

1158
01:46:35,186 --> 01:46:39,941
The army’s gotta change that law
next year, or the next one.

1159
01:46:40,066 --> 01:46:43,153
It just has to be. I’m sure of it.

1160
01:46:45,071 --> 01:46:49,826
And, in fact, I’m so sure of it
that I went downtown today

1161
01:46:49,951 --> 01:46:55,248
and I signed some papers here that mean
that you and I are gonna get married.

1162
01:46:58,126 --> 01:47:01,504
- What’s the matter?
- We never spoke of marriage.

1163
01:47:01,629 --> 01:47:05,133
I know we didn’t, darling.
I know we didn’t.

1164
01:47:05,258 --> 01:47:12,057
I’ve been going round and round with that
every day for a long time.

1165
01:47:12,182 --> 01:47:16,770
I didn’t feel I could
speak about it until now.

1166
01:47:16,895 --> 01:47:18,938
But now I can.

1167
01:47:20,190 --> 01:47:23,526
Now, of course, I won’t be able
to take you back to America,

1168
01:47:23,651 --> 01:47:27,822
but they’re bound to change
that ridiculous law soon.

1169
01:47:27,947 --> 01:47:31,326
Until then I’m gonna stay here with you.

1170
01:47:32,827 --> 01:47:35,830
I’m not stuck in the air force. I can resign.

1171
01:47:35,955 --> 01:47:41,503
Course, I’m not trained to do
anything else, but I’d find something.

1172
01:47:42,754 --> 01:47:45,382
We never spoke of marriage.

1173
01:47:46,341 --> 01:47:50,011
I know we didn’t, darling,
but we’re speaking of it now.

1174
01:47:57,477 --> 01:48:00,939
Do you remember
the first night we talked?

1175
01:48:01,064 --> 01:48:05,819
I said there would be danger
of weakness when it is over.

1176
01:48:08,321 --> 01:48:11,157
Over? What are you talking about?

1177
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:20,125
I’m tempted. With you, I could become
and woman and a mother,

1178
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:22,293
and I could love you.

1179
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:26,047
That’s right.

1180
01:48:26,172 --> 01:48:28,842
Do you think I haven’t thought about it?

1181
01:48:28,967 --> 01:48:34,305
Do you think I want to become a lonely
old woman who teaches dancing,

1182
01:48:34,431 --> 01:48:36,891
now that I have known you?

1183
01:48:38,393 --> 01:48:40,979
But it is no good.

1184
01:48:41,104 --> 01:48:46,776
- You must know it too.
- No. I don’t know anything of the kind.

1185
01:48:48,069 --> 01:48:51,698
The way you talk about
leaving the air force,

1186
01:48:51,823 --> 01:48:57,454
finding some pitiful way of earning living,
just to be here with your Japanese wife.

1187
01:48:57,579 --> 01:49:00,040
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1188
01:49:02,876 --> 01:49:07,756
I think we’re too far into this thing
to be talking like that.

1189
01:49:07,881 --> 01:49:11,634
Matsubayashi has been kind to me, Lloyd.

1190
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:16,348
- I am obligated to them.
- No, you ain’t. No, no.

1191
01:49:16,473 --> 01:49:18,558
You are obligated to me.

1192
01:49:19,893 --> 01:49:22,020
They are my life.

1193
01:49:22,145 --> 01:49:25,815
I would bring shame to them, disgrace.

1194
01:49:25,940 --> 01:49:28,068
Lloyd, you know what I mean.

1195
01:49:28,193 --> 01:49:31,863
Yeah, I think I’m beginning
to know what you mean.

1196
01:49:31,988 --> 01:49:35,658
I think you mean you simply don’t
love me enough to go on through with it.

1197
01:49:35,784 --> 01:49:40,455
That’s what you mean, don’t you? Why
don’t you just come on out and say it?

1198
01:49:40,580 --> 01:49:42,624
It is not what I mean.

1199
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:53,093
I’m leaving for Tokyo in six days.
Matsubayashi are sending me.

1200
01:49:53,218 --> 01:49:55,428
You what?

1201
01:49:57,097 --> 01:50:01,434
With another troupe.
They have found out about us.

1202
01:50:02,519 --> 01:50:06,481
Any other girl they would have dismissed,
but because they like me,

1203
01:50:06,606 --> 01:50:11,194
because they feel I am important to them,
they are being lenient.

1204
01:50:12,237 --> 01:50:15,490
Well, I’m not gonna be lenient with you.

1205
01:50:15,615 --> 01:50:20,829
I want you to tell me why Matsubayashi
means more to you than I do.

1206
01:50:23,164 --> 01:50:28,795
Lloyd, there is something about myself
I have not told you.

1207
01:50:28,920 --> 01:50:32,173
I have no right to marry anyone.

1208
01:50:32,298 --> 01:50:35,427
My father was very poor.

1209
01:50:35,552 --> 01:50:40,890
To save his other children,
he was forced to sell one of his daughters.

1210
01:50:42,475 --> 01:50:47,188
The man from
the houses of Yoshiwara came to him.

1211
01:50:47,313 --> 01:50:52,736
Because I was the oldest,
he agreed I should go with him.

1212
01:50:55,113 --> 01:50:57,782
Your father sold you?

1213
01:50:57,907 --> 01:51:05,081
Yes, but I was saved from starting this life
by my best friend, Fumiko-san.

1214
01:51:07,917 --> 01:51:10,670
Her father paid money to free me.

1215
01:51:11,880 --> 01:51:15,050
Then she brought me to Matsubayashi.

1216
01:51:17,802 --> 01:51:24,309
There I not only earned my living,
I brought honour back to my family.

1217
01:51:27,395 --> 01:51:30,565
Matsubayashi has been kind to me.

1218
01:51:30,690 --> 01:51:33,276
They have trusted me.

1219
01:51:34,152 --> 01:51:38,907
I cannot leave them.
I cannot marry anyone.

1220
01:51:42,869 --> 01:51:44,913
Don’t you understand?

1221
01:51:51,795 --> 01:51:53,838
I don’t know.

1222
01:51:54,964 --> 01:51:58,468
- I don’t know what to think.
{y:i}- (smashing)

1223
01:51:59,594 --> 01:52:05,433
I’ll kill you: You ever do anything like this
and I’ll kill you, you understand?

1224
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
 

1225
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
 

1226
01:52:05,558 --> 01:52:10,522
- Wait a minute. Just take it easy, now.
- Ace, look at this.

1227
01:52:11,815 --> 01:52:13,942
- It fell out of her bag.
- What is it?

1228
01:52:14,067 --> 01:52:18,863
She was gonna have it done tomorrow,
by that quack doctor down by the docks.

1229
01:52:18,988 --> 01:52:22,951
For eight bucks he slashes her eyelids
and sews ‘em back up again.

1230
01:52:23,076 --> 01:52:28,373
Lots of these stupid little jerks
have it done. She was gonna surprise me.

1231
01:52:28,498 --> 01:52:33,920
Then... then I have good eyes,
I fool everybody.

1232
01:52:34,045 --> 01:52:37,882
I look American, like Joe.

1233
01:52:38,008 --> 01:52:43,471
Hana-ogi, will you tell that stupid dame
I love her the way she is?

1234
01:52:43,596 --> 01:52:48,101
I don’t want her changed. Will you tell her
I love her mouth and her nose

1235
01:52:48,226 --> 01:52:52,105
and her ears and her eyes
just the way they are?

1236
01:52:52,230 --> 01:52:57,527
Tell her if she ever does
anything like that, I’ll...

1237
01:52:57,652 --> 01:53:01,448
I want him be proud of me.

1238
01:53:01,573 --> 01:53:03,283
I’m sorry.

1239
01:53:03,408 --> 01:53:06,327
If you want him to be proud of you,
quit this stuff.

1240
01:53:06,453 --> 01:53:12,292
You’re making him very unhappy.
Tell him you’re not gonna do it any more.

1241
01:53:12,417 --> 01:53:15,128
- Tell him that.
- Joe.

1242
01:53:15,253 --> 01:53:16,921
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

1243
01:53:17,047 --> 01:53:18,840
I’m so sorry.

1244
01:53:18,965 --> 01:53:21,843
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

1245
01:53:21,968 --> 01:53:24,846
We’re gonna forget about that.

1246
01:53:24,971 --> 01:53:30,477
I thought we were gonna have a fish fry,
have some fun and dancing and yelling.

1247
01:53:30,602 --> 01:53:33,355
And what do I find?
So what’s gonna happen to us?

1248
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:35,648
- Puppet show.
- We had a surprise.

1249
01:53:35,774 --> 01:53:38,902
- You like?
- Sure I do. I’ve been looking forward to it.

1250
01:53:39,027 --> 01:53:42,280
- Everybody tonight?
- Yeah.

1251
01:53:42,405 --> 01:53:44,449
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

1252
01:53:47,118 --> 01:53:49,162
We will be late.

1253
01:53:49,913 --> 01:53:51,748
{y:i}(singing)

1254
01:53:56,670 --> 01:53:58,213
Look.

1255
01:53:58,338 --> 01:54:01,174
The lover is leaving the city.

1256
01:54:01,299 --> 01:54:03,343
Walk to the wood.

1257
01:54:40,714 --> 01:54:44,467
Lloyd, don’t think of anything now.

1258
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:47,762
Watch the play.

1259
01:54:47,887 --> 01:54:49,931
It’s a tender story.

1260
01:54:58,231 --> 01:55:02,152
When gong sound, it is dawn,

1261
01:55:02,277 --> 01:55:07,282
and then she will bind her body.

1262
01:55:08,241 --> 01:55:09,743
Bind her body?

1263
01:55:09,868 --> 01:55:16,124
So that she will not fall in an ugly position
of dishonour when she dies.

1264
01:55:16,249 --> 01:55:19,210
- When she dies?
- Yes.

1265
01:55:19,336 --> 01:55:21,379
{y:i}(gong sounds)

1266
01:55:36,644 --> 01:55:42,859
It is custom for lovers to die together
when they can no longer face life.

1267
01:55:52,952 --> 01:55:55,413
It is so beautiful.

1268
01:55:56,164 --> 01:55:59,501
Beautiful? They’re gonna die, aren’t they?

1269
01:55:59,626 --> 01:56:04,339
They will live in another world
on a beautiful lake,

1270
01:56:04,464 --> 01:56:07,676
floating always together.

1271
01:56:07,801 --> 01:56:09,844
Like water lily.

1272
01:56:12,514 --> 01:56:14,557
Sure.

1273
01:57:11,156 --> 01:57:13,199
{y:i}(applause)

1274
01:57:35,930 --> 01:57:39,726
"(child)" Kelly-san: Kelly-san: Kelly-san:

1275
01:57:41,102 --> 01:57:43,646
{y:i}(Kelly speaks Japanese)

1276
01:57:47,817 --> 01:57:49,194
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

1277
01:57:49,319 --> 01:57:53,740
Something about soldiers
going through the house.

1278
01:57:57,327 --> 01:58:00,622
- That’s the MPs, boy.
- What happened? What’s wrong?

1279
01:58:00,747 --> 01:58:03,500
- What happened?
- Get in the car.

1280
01:58:05,335 --> 01:58:09,714
- Please tell me.
- Go to Matsubayashi. I’ll tell you later.

1281
01:58:09,839 --> 01:58:10,840
Matsubayashi.

1282
01:58:13,968 --> 01:58:16,262
Hey, Ed, look.

1283
01:58:31,653 --> 01:58:33,697
Look at that.

1284
01:58:35,949 --> 01:58:39,119
- You’re Major Gruver, aren’t you?
- That’s right.

1285
01:58:39,244 --> 01:58:42,038
You’ll have to come with us.
General Webster’s orders.

1286
01:58:42,163 --> 01:58:44,541
What right do you have
to board up this house?

1287
01:58:44,666 --> 01:58:46,960
He won’t be needing it. He’s shipping out.

1288
01:58:47,085 --> 01:58:48,878
Joe:

1289
01:58:49,004 --> 01:58:51,047
Come on, Major.

1290
01:58:52,966 --> 01:58:55,427
You’ll hear from me, Kelly.

1291
01:59:08,773 --> 01:59:11,651
Come on, kid.
We’ll get in through the garden.

1292
01:59:11,776 --> 01:59:14,571
I got something to tell you.

1293
01:59:37,552 --> 01:59:40,972
You were seen in public with her tonight,
violating orders.

1294
01:59:41,097 --> 01:59:44,684
This has given me the right
to put you under arrest.

1295
01:59:44,809 --> 01:59:48,396
And for your own sake,
I think I better do it.

1296
01:59:48,521 --> 01:59:51,649
Well? Have you anything to say?

1297
01:59:53,693 --> 02:00:00,658
Just as soon as I’m out of this, I’m gonna
be married and have a house of my own.

1298
02:00:00,784 --> 02:00:05,080
I’m afraid not.
I’m sorry, Lloyd, but it’s all settled.

1299
02:00:05,205 --> 02:00:08,833
The supervisor of the Matsubayashi
came to see me tonight.

1300
02:00:08,958 --> 02:00:14,214
The girl goes to Tokyo and you fly to
Randolph Field the day after tomorrow.

1301
02:00:14,339 --> 02:00:17,133
Here are your orders.

1302
02:00:17,258 --> 02:00:21,262
Until that time, you’re under house arrest.

1303
02:00:21,388 --> 02:00:26,226
You’re not to leave your quarters
until further notice.

1304
02:00:30,021 --> 02:00:33,566
I’m doing this because I feel
you’re not responsible at the moment.

1305
02:00:33,692 --> 02:00:37,278
After all, I’ve known your father for years.

1306
02:00:42,033 --> 02:00:44,494
Well, that’s all.

1307
02:01:04,347 --> 02:01:06,391
{y:i}(horn blares)

1308
02:01:19,487 --> 02:01:21,531
Mike.

1309
02:01:21,656 --> 02:01:24,242
- Did you see her?
- I couldn’t get near the place.

1310
02:01:24,367 --> 02:01:27,579
They’ve really clamped down.
I couldn’t even see Fumiko-san.

1311
02:01:27,704 --> 02:01:30,582
I’ve got to see her.
I’m being shipped out tomorrow.

1312
02:01:30,707 --> 02:01:33,293
- Major Gruver.
- What is it?

1313
02:01:33,418 --> 02:01:36,504
- Would you do something for us?
- What do you want?

1314
02:01:36,629 --> 02:01:39,716
- Airman Kelly’s disappeared.
- That’s impossible.

1315
02:01:39,841 --> 02:01:42,302
- I was with him just last night.
- We know.

1316
02:01:42,427 --> 02:01:47,640
A special plane came through and
Colonel Crawford told us to get him on it.

1317
02:01:47,766 --> 02:01:52,896
I took him to the airport at 1 2.50. When
the plane took off, Kelly wasn’t on it.

1318
02:01:53,021 --> 02:01:57,817
- We figured you might know where he is.
- His house has been boarded up.

1319
02:01:57,942 --> 02:01:58,943
We know.

1320
02:01:59,069 --> 02:02:02,947
Neighbours won’t talk to us.
We figure maybe they’re hiding him.

1321
02:02:03,073 --> 02:02:06,451
They’ll talk with you, Major.
Would you help us?

1322
02:02:06,576 --> 02:02:10,497
Would you give me one good reason
why I should?

1323
02:02:11,456 --> 02:02:14,876
We figured we’d give him a break.
We haven’t reported him yet.

1324
02:02:15,001 --> 02:02:21,341
If we get him on another plane, we might
not have to turn him in for desertion.

1325
02:02:21,466 --> 02:02:23,510
- Desertion?
- Yes, sir.

1326
02:02:27,055 --> 02:02:29,099
Well...

1327
02:02:29,933 --> 02:02:33,561
- I’ll go with you in a minute.
- Major.

1328
02:02:33,687 --> 02:02:36,064
The neighbours won’t talk
if they see an MP.

1329
02:02:36,189 --> 02:02:39,150
- I’ll go with him.
- Thank you, sir.

1330
02:03:39,502 --> 02:03:41,546
Kelly?

1331
02:03:44,007 --> 02:03:46,051
It’s Gruver out here.

1332
02:03:48,261 --> 02:03:50,305
I think he’s in there.

1333
02:03:51,765 --> 02:03:53,808
Kelly?

1334
02:03:55,018 --> 02:03:57,062
I’m goin’ on in.

1335
02:04:10,825 --> 02:04:12,869
Kelly?

1336
02:04:12,994 --> 02:04:15,038
{y:i}(water running)

1337
02:04:19,334 --> 02:04:21,378
Kelly?

1338
02:04:27,175 --> 02:04:29,844
Kelly? You in there?

1339
02:04:53,451 --> 02:04:55,495
Oh, my God:

1340
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:01,084
Oh, my...

1341
02:05:21,271 --> 02:05:23,314
Oh...

1342
02:05:29,154 --> 02:05:31,406
I’ll call the police, Ace.

1343
02:05:48,882 --> 02:05:50,925
Oh, God:

1344
02:06:26,294 --> 02:06:29,464
"(whispers)" Sayonara, Kelly-san.

1345
02:06:32,926 --> 02:06:36,888
Sayonara, Katsumi-san.

1346
02:06:46,815 --> 02:06:51,486
Sayonara, my Lloyd-san.

1347
02:07:27,564 --> 02:07:30,942
"(crowd chanting)" Go home: Go home:

1348
02:07:36,531 --> 02:07:41,369
Ace, there’s no police around.
We better get outta here.

1349
02:07:42,078 --> 02:07:44,080
Hey, look.

1350
02:07:51,379 --> 02:07:54,049
Doesn’t look too good, boy.

1351
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:58,136
{y:i}(crowd continue chanting)

1352
02:07:59,596 --> 02:08:01,473
Come on, take it easy.

1353
02:08:34,714 --> 02:08:36,841
We’re gettin’ help, Ace.

1354
02:08:49,979 --> 02:08:53,358
- You OK, boy?
- I’m fine. You all right?

1355
02:08:53,483 --> 02:08:54,943
Yeah.

1356
02:08:55,068 --> 02:08:59,572
I’m gonna... I want you
to take care of everything, will you?

1357
02:08:59,698 --> 02:09:02,200
Yeah, I’ll get it.

1358
02:09:02,325 --> 02:09:04,369
I’ll see you later.

1359
02:09:06,371 --> 02:09:08,206
{y:i}(whistIes)

1360
02:09:51,583 --> 02:09:53,877
- Where’s Hana-ogi?
- Hana-ogi is not here.

1361
02:09:54,002 --> 02:09:57,213
- I know she’s here.
- She is on her way Tokyo.

1362
02:09:57,339 --> 02:10:00,884
- She wasn’t going till next week.
- She went today.

1363
02:10:01,009 --> 02:10:06,264
- I don’t believe you.
- Major Gruver: It’s forbidden to go in.

1364

{y:i}(women singing)

1365

Hana-ogi?

1366
02:11:04,906 --> 02:11:08,159
Hana-ogi? Hana-ogi?

1367
02:11:08,743 --> 02:11:10,787
Hana-ogi?

1368
02:11:20,380 --> 02:11:22,424
Hana-ogi?

1369
02:11:28,930 --> 02:11:31,224
- Gruver-san:
- Where’s Hana-ogi?

1370
02:11:31,349 --> 02:11:33,184
- She’s gone.
- Where’s her room?

1371
02:11:33,309 --> 02:11:36,813
- She’s gone.
- Listen, where’s her room?

1372
02:11:36,938 --> 02:11:38,815
Come here.

1373
02:11:41,735 --> 02:11:44,279
Hana-ogi really gone, Major.

1374
02:11:44,404 --> 02:11:46,448
I don’t believe you.

1375
02:11:47,115 --> 02:11:49,159
Hana-ogi?

1376
02:11:54,831 --> 02:11:59,711
I give you my word.
You go now too, Major.

1377
02:11:59,836 --> 02:12:02,172
It’s over.

1378
02:12:02,297 --> 02:12:05,133
Leave me alone a minute, will you?

1379
02:12:07,469 --> 02:12:09,512
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

1380
02:12:21,107 --> 02:12:24,652
The hoodlums who attacked you
weren’t all your Japanese neighbours.

1381
02:12:24,778 --> 02:12:27,530
They were troublemakers
sent to your street

1382
02:12:27,655 --> 02:12:30,492
to create an incident specifically with you.

1383
02:12:30,617 --> 02:12:33,787
If you’re important to those who hate us,

1384
02:12:33,912 --> 02:12:37,415
don’t you see
how important you are to us?

1385
02:12:39,501 --> 02:12:42,796
Do you understand any of this, Lloyd?

1386
02:12:44,589 --> 02:12:46,716
I know how you feel.

1387
02:12:46,841 --> 02:12:48,301
It was...

1388
02:12:48,426 --> 02:12:54,307
It was dreadful about your friend Kelly
and... and his wife.

1389
02:12:56,393 --> 02:12:58,853
It must be hard to take.

1390
02:13:00,939 --> 02:13:05,360
And I... I hate to tell you something else,

1391
02:13:05,485 --> 02:13:09,781
because it’s almost too grotesque...

1392
02:13:12,701 --> 02:13:15,704
almost unforgivable
in your eyes, I imagine.

1393
02:13:15,829 --> 02:13:22,627
I got word today that there’s a law
being passed in a month or two

1394
02:13:22,752 --> 02:13:26,214
that will make it possible
for men like Kelly

1395
02:13:26,339 --> 02:13:30,552
to take their Japanese brides
back to the States.

1396
02:13:34,681 --> 02:13:40,353
- That can’t be true, General.
- Well, it happens to be true, Lloyd.

1397
02:13:44,983 --> 02:13:50,238
Listen, how do you get the guts
to come here and tell me that?

1398
02:13:50,363 --> 02:13:54,117
It takes time to get laws passed, Lloyd.

1399
02:13:54,242 --> 02:13:58,955
And a lot of people have died in this world
needlessly waiting for them.

1400
02:13:59,080 --> 02:14:03,209
It’s harder to take
when it hits you personally.

1401
02:14:05,670 --> 02:14:07,672
Lloyd...

1402
02:14:07,797 --> 02:14:10,467
You’re lost. You’re confused.

1403
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:15,847
Don’t you think it’s time you got back
to the mainstream of your life?

1404
02:14:15,972 --> 02:14:20,518
Back to your roots,
what you were born for and raised for.

1405
02:14:20,643 --> 02:14:27,776
You’ll feel better about everything when
you get back home, back to your work.

1406
02:14:27,901 --> 02:14:30,820
I appreciate you coming over, General.

1407
02:15:12,153 --> 02:15:14,614
Take me to the airport, Mike.

1408
02:15:20,328 --> 02:15:22,497
That must be him.

1409
02:15:22,622 --> 02:15:28,294
- Hold it so we can get a picture, General.
- Where would you like me?

1410
02:15:28,795 --> 02:15:30,839
Smile, please.

1411
02:15:36,511 --> 02:15:40,515
- Bill, isn’t that Ace Gruver?
- Looks like him.

1412
02:15:43,268 --> 02:15:45,478
Sir.

1413
02:15:45,603 --> 02:15:47,939
Aren’t you Major Gruver? Ace Gruver?

1414
02:15:48,064 --> 02:15:50,775
- That’s right.
- We’re from the "Stars and Stripes."

1415
02:15:50,900 --> 02:15:55,447
- What are you doing in Tokyo?
- I’m just passing through, boys.

1416
02:15:55,572 --> 02:15:58,992
- Just seeing the sights, huh?
- That’s right. I’m in a hurry.

1417
02:15:59,117 --> 02:16:03,955
- Do you mind if I excuse myself? Sorry.
- You’re excused.

1418
02:16:15,342 --> 02:16:17,177

Hello.

1424
02:18:29,392 --> 02:18:31,436
{y:i}(speaks Japanese)

1425
02:18:44,699 --> 02:18:47,035
Hello, Hana-ogi.

1426
02:18:49,329 --> 02:18:52,999
I’m goin’ back to America on Friday,

1427
02:18:53,124 --> 02:18:58,171
and I probably won’t
get back in Japan again.

1428
02:19:01,466 --> 02:19:04,344
And before I go, there was just...

1429
02:19:05,720 --> 02:19:08,390
just one thing I wanted to know.

1430
02:19:10,850 --> 02:19:14,145
You remember one time you said to me...

1431
02:19:16,189 --> 02:19:22,320
that you could love me
and be a wife and a mother?

1432
02:19:23,822 --> 02:19:26,241
I remember.

1433
02:19:28,076 --> 02:19:30,120
You said that since you’d known me,

1434
02:19:30,245 --> 02:19:35,834
you’d been afraid of being
a lonely old woman teaching dancing.

1435
02:19:35,959 --> 02:19:38,795
Remember that?

1436
02:19:38,920 --> 02:19:41,172
I remember.

1437
02:19:41,923 --> 02:19:46,136
Did you mean that
when you said it, Hana-ogi?

1438
02:19:47,095 --> 02:19:50,974
I meant it. It is already happening.

1439
02:19:51,099 --> 02:19:55,645
Life has gone out of my work, out of me.

1440
02:19:55,770 --> 02:19:58,648
Lloyd, please go now.

1441
02:19:58,773 --> 02:20:02,068
This will only bring pain and trouble.

1442
02:20:04,320 --> 02:20:08,366
Hana-ogi, you and I
are gonna have more trouble

1443
02:20:08,491 --> 02:20:11,119
than we ever thought
of having in our whole lives

1444
02:20:11,244 --> 02:20:15,457
unless you are absolutely
honest with yourself.

1445
02:20:16,791 --> 02:20:21,338
Please, Lloyd,
can’t we talk about this later?

1446
02:20:21,463 --> 02:20:27,469
No. There’s isn’t gonna be any later.
There’s only gonna be right now.

1447
02:20:29,429 --> 02:20:31,973
Excuse me, mother. Excuse me.

1448
02:20:36,061 --> 02:20:39,105
I must return this robe.

1449
02:20:39,230 --> 02:20:43,902
I wanna know -
do you love me or don’t you?

1450
02:20:45,111 --> 02:20:50,867
Because if you don’t, then I’m gonna
have to find a way to live with it.

1451
02:20:50,992 --> 02:20:53,620
- And if you do...
- Please, Lloyd.

1452
02:20:55,413 --> 02:20:57,874
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1453
02:21:01,086 --> 02:21:05,507
I don’t want you to tell me
anything more or anything less

1454
02:21:05,632 --> 02:21:09,260
than you feel
in the very deepest part of you.

1455
02:21:09,386 --> 02:21:15,892
Because what you answer to me now
is gonna affect us for the rest of our lives.

1456
02:21:16,768 --> 02:21:20,689
Do you love me, Hana-ogi,
or don’t you love me?

1457
02:21:23,525 --> 02:21:26,361
I’m so frightened and confused.

1458
02:21:26,486 --> 02:21:30,365
I cannot think.
I cannot even understand your thinking.

1459
02:21:30,490 --> 02:21:36,913
I’m not thinking. For the first time
in my life I’m not thinking and I don’t care.

1460
02:21:37,038 --> 02:21:39,082
But we must do the right thing.

1461
02:21:39,207 --> 02:21:41,710
What are you talking about,
the right thing?

1462
02:21:41,835 --> 02:21:44,921
We been wasting two good lives
trying to do the right thing -

1463
02:21:45,046 --> 02:21:48,925
the right thing for Matsubayashi,
the right thing for my father,

1464
02:21:49,050 --> 02:21:53,138
the right thing for the military,
the right thing for Japanese tradition,

1465
02:21:53,263 --> 02:21:56,433
the right thing for the great white race.

1466
02:21:56,558 --> 02:22:02,022
- But we have duties and obligations.
- We do have duties and obligations.

1467
02:22:02,147 --> 02:22:05,358
The first obligation we have
is to love each other,

1468
02:22:05,483 --> 02:22:09,237
to become man and wife
and raise some clean, sweet children,

1469
02:22:09,362 --> 02:22:12,323
and give them the very best
that we know how.

1470
02:22:12,449 --> 02:22:17,829
And if we don’t meet that obligation,
we ain’t gonna be any good to anybody.

1471
02:22:17,954 --> 02:22:22,792
We live in different worlds,
come from different races.

1472
02:22:24,919 --> 02:22:28,423
Honey, I want you to be my wife.

1473
02:22:30,091 --> 02:22:33,970
But what would happen to our children?
What would they be?

1474
02:22:34,095 --> 02:22:38,099
What would they be?
They’d be half-Japanese, half-American.

1475
02:22:38,224 --> 02:22:41,102
They’d be half-yellow and half-white.

1476
02:22:41,227 --> 02:22:44,105
They’d be half you, they’d be half me.

1477
02:22:44,230 --> 02:22:47,692
That’s all they’re gonna be.

1478
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
 

1479
02:22:59,746 --> 02:23:03,124
Hana-ogi, I want you
to come with me now.

1480
02:23:04,334 --> 02:23:09,214
I want you to come with me now
down to the American consulate.

1481
02:23:09,339 --> 02:23:12,384
Here in Tokyo. We’re gonna start
filling out those papers.

1482
02:23:12,509 --> 02:23:18,306
We’ve only got a few days to get
this whole thing done and out of the way.

1483
02:23:26,481 --> 02:23:28,525
Will you come?

1484
02:23:38,910 --> 02:23:41,579
I’m gonna wait for you outside.

1485
02:24:11,484 --> 02:24:13,653
Did I tell you they’d be here?

1486
02:24:13,778 --> 02:24:18,366
- Look at this crowd.
- Look who’s here. Our rivals.

1487
02:24:18,491 --> 02:24:24,289
You guys heard about it too?
No secrets. No secrets in this country.

1488
02:24:29,586 --> 02:24:32,380
Major, what a coincidence.

1489
02:24:32,505 --> 02:24:34,758
You got a story for us, sir?

1490
02:24:35,717 --> 02:24:37,886
No, as a matter of fact, I don’t.

1491
02:24:38,011 --> 02:24:41,806
- You’re not gonna try to deny it, are you?
- Deny what?

1492
02:24:41,931 --> 02:24:44,559
The story.
Why won’t you give us the story?

1493
02:24:44,684 --> 02:24:48,104
- You’re big news now, sir.
- I don’t know what you’re talking about.

1494
02:24:50,648 --> 02:24:53,818
Here’s Hana-ogi. Maybe she’ll talk.

1495
02:24:58,698 --> 02:25:01,368
{y:i}(speak Japanese)

1496
02:25:06,539 --> 02:25:09,084
{y:i}(excited chatter from crowd)

1497
02:25:10,293 --> 02:25:14,255
Come on, Hana-ogi.
That’s not fair. What did you say?

1498
02:25:14,381 --> 02:25:19,803
It is very difficult for a Japanese woman
to speak in public.

1499
02:25:19,928 --> 02:25:22,764
I have never done so.

1500
02:25:22,889 --> 02:25:25,433
But perhaps now it is the time.

1501
02:25:26,851 --> 02:25:31,272
Major Gruver has asked me
to be his... his wife.

1502
02:25:34,984 --> 02:25:40,156
He knows there are many people in
this country who will be disturbed by this.

1503
02:25:40,281 --> 02:25:43,118
I know my people will be shocked too.

1504
02:25:43,243 --> 02:25:48,498
But I hope they will learn to understand
and someday approve.

1505
02:25:49,791 --> 02:25:54,671
We are not afraid,
because we know this is right.

1506
02:25:54,796 --> 02:25:57,382
I hope I can continue as a dancer

1507
02:25:57,507 --> 02:26:03,179
and I hope when I am old,
I will be able to teach children to dance.

1508
02:26:04,305 --> 02:26:07,142
- My own children.
{y:i}- (crowd gasps)

1509
02:26:07,267 --> 02:26:10,395
Major, the big brass are gonna
yell their heads off.

1510
02:26:10,520 --> 02:26:17,360
The Japanese aren’t gonna like it either.
Have you got anything to say to them, sir?

1511
02:26:17,485 --> 02:26:21,322
Yeah. Tell ‘em we said “sayonara”.

1512
02:26:21,448 --> 02:26:25,326
? "Sayonara"

1513
02:26:25,452 --> 02:26:29,080
? "Japanese goodbye"

1514
02:26:29,205 --> 02:26:32,834
? "Whisper “Sayonara”"

1515
02:26:33,209 --> 02:26:36,963
? "Lover, don’t you cry"

1516
02:26:37,088 --> 02:26:40,967
? "No more we stop to see"

1517
02:26:41,092 --> 02:26:44,721
? "Pretty cherry blossom"

1518
02:26:44,846 --> 02:26:48,641
? "No more we ‘neath the tree"

1519
02:26:48,767 --> 02:26:51,853
? "Looking at the sky"

1520
02:26:52,812 --> 02:26:56,608
? "Sayonara"

1521
02:26:56,733 --> 02:27:00,528
? "Sayonara"

1522
02:27:00,653 --> 02:27:04,074
? "Goodbye"
