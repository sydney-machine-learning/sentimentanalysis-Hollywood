1
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,429
The island of Santa Marta
is not very much different...

2
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,836
from any of the other
smaller islands in the Caribbean.

3
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:31,240
Towering mountains,
white gold beaches...

4
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:35,838
coconut palms
and hot tropical sun.

5
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,084
It has a population
of about 100,000...

6
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:43,519
9/10ths of it colored
or of mixed blood.

7
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:47,081
Its main industry is
raising sugar, copra, cocoa...

8
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,093
and exporting them.

9
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,095
Originally a French Island...

10
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:55,031
its laborers were brought in slave ships
from the Gold Coast of Africa...

11
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,568
four and a half centuries ago.

12
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,470
And now it is
a British Crown Colony.

13
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,168
Well, that about sums up
all the facts you'll find...

14
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,745
in the tourist guides,
Mr. Bradshaw.

15
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:10,577
Of course, as a journalist, you'll want
to see as much of our island as possible.

16
00:04:10,683 --> 00:04:14,278
If you're in doubt about anything,
get in touch with Colonel Whittingham here.

17
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,878
Nothing like being on the right side
of the police, eh, Colonel?

18
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,890
- Quite so.
- Denis.

19
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,426
- Sir?
- Have you arranged for Mr. Bradshaw's hotel?

20
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,587
- The St. James.
- Good. Very comfortable, the St. James.

21
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:27,894
- Excellent bar.
- I don't drink, sir.

22
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,969
- Oh.
- Doctor's orders.

23
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:31,969
Pity.

24
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:35,199
- Well, we'll be seeing you this afternoon at the reception.
- Thank you, Your Excellency.

25
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,469
Oh, Your Excellency,
just one more question.

26
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:41,445
I'm very interested in the new constitution
that's being given to the islands.

27
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:45,984
Do you think the West Indian
is ready to govern himself?

28
00:04:46,085 --> 00:04:48,849
When you get to know
the island better, Mr. Bradshaw...

29
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,118
I shall be glad to discuss it with you.

30
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:54,125
Good day, sir.

31
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,625
Is there much discontent
in the islands, Colonel?

32
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,398
Crime's my business,
Mr. Bradshaw, not politics.

33
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,938
Sylvia?

34
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,375
Sylvia.

35
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,378
Sylvia?

36
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,549
Sylvia?

37
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,287
- Bye, Mavis. See you later.
- Bye.

38
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,331
- Want some help?
- Yes.

39
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,900
Well, call somebody.

40
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,101
Maxwell, how nice.
I didn't expect you until later.

41
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,939
- I won't be a minute.
- I'll wait.

42
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,214
Please, dear.
I'm hot and sticky.

43
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:04,712
- Did you see your father?
- We lunched at the club.

44
00:07:04,824 --> 00:07:07,520
Mother's coming back tomorrow from Barbados.
My sister tell you?

45
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,221
- Oh, there you are.
- Here are the towels.

46
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,661
Thanks, dear.
Well, I'm off for a shower.

47
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,824
Tell Mavis we'll see her
at H.E.'s party.

48
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,834
Okay.

49
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,837
- How was the beach?
- Oh, fun.

50
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:28,403
- Anybody there I know?
- Oh, you know, the usual bunch.

51
00:07:28,514 --> 00:07:30,505
What time's the party
at Government House?

52
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,751
The invitation said 5:30.

53
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,950
- Anything wrong?
- What?

54
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,493
Well, you've a very odd look.

55
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,758
You haven't changed to
smoking Egyptian cigarettes, have you?

56
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:49,266
- No. Why?
- You better run along.

57
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,393
You gonna meet Mother
at the plane tomorrow?

58
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,166
No, Daddy's going.
Why don't you go with him?

59
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:57,037
- She'd prefer to have you.
- Well-

60
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,941
- Tell Sylvia that I'll see her later.
- Mm-hmm.

61
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,859
- Is that you, darling?
- Yes.

62
00:08:26,138 --> 00:08:28,800
We'll have to hurry.
What time did the invitation say?

63
00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:31,900
5:30. Do we have to go?

64
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:35,208
- I'd rather stay out here at Belfontaine.
- We can't very well not go.

65
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,214
After all, it's protocol.

66
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:41,013
Besides, it's a party to welcome
Lord Templeton's only son and heir.

67
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,020
- What's his name?
- Who?

68
00:08:43,122 --> 00:08:46,614
- The governor's son.
- Euan, I think.

69
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,956
I saw his picture
in the Tatler.

70
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:52,087
Pass me a tissue,
would you, darling?

71
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,632
He's been stationed in the Middle East
for the last 18 months.

72
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:58,033
This will be a holiday for him.
He's going up to Oxford in the autumn.

73
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,037
You seem to know
a great deal about him.

74
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,039
Well, you know the island.

75
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,770
A male-young, white, unmarried,
titled and comparatively rich-

76
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,438
Good heavens. What else
do you think the girls would talk about?

77
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,775
- Darling, you're not jealous, are you?
- A bit.

78
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,878
- Whatever of?
- Anybody with all those virtues.

79
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,191
That's the penalty
for being so much in love with you.

80
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,627
That's sweet.

81
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,789
Anybody out
at the house today?

82
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,797
- Out at the house?
- While I was in town.

83
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,464
No, not that I know of.

84
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,134
- Why?
- I just wondered.

85
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,743
Darling, you must get dressed.
We'll never get to the party.

86
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,750
Mrs. de Voeux.

87
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:22,547
Mrs. de Voeux is matron
of our hospital.

88
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:25,681
Her son also captains our best cricket team.
My son, Euan.

89
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,420
I know exactly
how young Templeton feels.

90
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,758
Eighteen months military duty
in the Middle East.

91
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:35,129
Desert, fleas,
not a woman in miles.

92
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:37,134
How do you do?

93
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,704
How are you?

94
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,371
No need for you
to stand guard, my boy.

95
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,310
I'll hold the fort.
You start campaigning.

96
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,313
Thank you, sir.

97
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,778
Oh, no, no. I can't go in.
I haven't been invited.

98
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,348
I can't crash a party
at Government House.

99
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,191
But you can...
if you're with David Boyeur.

100
00:11:05,297 --> 00:11:08,232
I'll say you're my cousin.
What difference does it make?

101
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,531
It makes a difference to me.
If I go in, I go in as Margot Seaton.

102
00:11:11,637 --> 00:11:14,629
If I have to leave,
I'll leave as Margot Seaton.

103
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,470
That's all right with me,
if that's the way you want it.

104
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:19,908
Well, it may get you
into trouble with the governor.

105
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:23,980
Me? Trouble with the governor?

106
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:27,280
Templeton needs me
much more than I need him.

107
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:29,650
Do you really want me to go?

108
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:32,690
Yes, I do. You're an idiot to be afraid
of those people up there.

109
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,692
What for?

110
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,694
Do you mind
getting out of the driveway?

111
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,099
We're going in.

112
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,568
All right.
But I warn you, you may regret it.

113
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,477
What do representative girls
in their early 20s...

114
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,479
drink at the beach
in Santa Marta, Colonel?

115
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,516
- Rum swizzles, I believe.
- Rum swizzles?

116
00:11:58,617 --> 00:12:03,145
Tomorrow afternoon then?
With a thermos full of rum swizzles.

117
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,881
Excuse me.
There's my father.

118
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:18,902
Ah, there you are.

119
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,939
I was beginning to think
my secretary had forgotten to invite you.

120
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,010
- Your Excellency, Miss Margot Seaton.
- How do you do?

121
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:27,011
Will you excuse me?

122
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:29,809
There's an American journalist
here I'd like you to meet.

123
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,076
I'm sure you've explained
how dangerous I am.

124
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,312
Of course.
Our homegrown revolutionary.

125
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,185
The press is a nuisance,
but it exists.

126
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,850
And I believe in cooperating
with what exists.

127
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,721
I'm Denis Archer,
the governor's aide.

128
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:49,062
How is it I haven't
seen you before?

129
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,399
Maybe it's because you buy
your toothpaste at the wrong drugstore.

130
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,339
What should I take that to mean?

131
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,807
- I work at the Bon Marche drugstore.
- Oh.

132
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:00,310
In that case,
I shall change my patronage.

133
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:05,617
You're wondering
what I'm doing here, aren't you?

134
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,585
- Well, uh-
- Well, I wasn't invited.

135
00:13:08,687 --> 00:13:11,247
Uh, David Boyeur
dared me to come.

136
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,257
I don't like being dared.

137
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,193
I see.

138
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,787
Next time I shall see that you're properly invited.

139
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,901
- The colonel's been telling me about David Boyeur.
- Oh, has he?

140
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:28,940
Yes. There's a man with real power.

141
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,737
Notice the very special
treatment His Excellency's giving him.

142
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,574
Strange. In all the years
I've lived on this island, I've never met him.

143
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,773
Oh, I have.
He used to work in the kitchens...

144
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,180
at the St. James Hotel
when we used to live there.

145
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,515
And I was very,
very young.

146
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,815
- He's gone far since then.
- Too far.

147
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,687
- Why don't you take up Boyeur's challenge?
- What do you mean?

148
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,625
With this new constitution,
Boyeur's going to try and capture...

149
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:52,390
the legislature
at the next general election.

150
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:56,229
Seems to me some of you planters
should go in for politics, and rather quickly.

151
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,565
Fight him at the polls.
Stand for election.

152
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,730
- Me?
- Yes. Why not you?

153
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,740
The Fleury name means
a great deal on the island.

154
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,606
Everyone respects your father,
even the West-

155
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,941
You'd stand an excellent chance of winning.

156
00:14:12,284 --> 00:14:14,184
Do you often smoke these?

157
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:16,754
Only on special occasions.

158
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,756
They're Egyptian, aren't they?

159
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:22,055
Yes, I had them made for me in Cairo.
They're very difficult to get here.

160
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,229
My childhood wasn't
very much different...

161
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,822
from any of the other children
who I grew up with.

162
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:30,424
It was always the same story.

163
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,130
Rum and ginger, please.

164
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:38,336
No opportunity for anything.
No one to tell, pay any attention.

165
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,571
That's when I began organizing.

166
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:43,477
One of the most important fights
is against tradition.

167
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:45,982
This island's shackled with traditions.

168
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,418
- Would you agree with that, Mr. Fleury?
- What?

169
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:53,981
Mr. Boyeur here says he thinks
the island is bound with tradition.

170
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:56,687
What would Mr. Boyeur
have us do? Forget them?

171
00:14:56,795 --> 00:15:01,357
Mr. Fleury speaks as if traditions
belong only to him. We have ours too.

172
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,061
I'd be the last to deny him his traditions.

173
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,296
Which ones, Mr. Fleury?

174
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,635
The ones we got
on the slave ships?

175
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,005
Or in the cane fields
working like beasts?

176
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,578
Or the ones we have now-
the ones we are making every day...

177
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,273
despite the slave ships
and the cane fields.

178
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,715
No, Mr. Bradshaw, we don't intend
to live the way our fathers did.

179
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:21,718
Your father,
if I remember correctly...

180
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,220
worked on my father's plantation.

181
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,655
- Till the day he died.
- He was well taken care of-

182
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,954
whether he was sick or not,
whether he worked or not.

183
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,995
That was charity, Mr. Fleury.

184
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:33,223
What we want is equality.

185
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,768
What I want is a drink.
How about you, Maxwell?

186
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,361
No, I won't have one.
Uh, this- this headache.

187
00:15:40,472 --> 00:15:43,373
- Do you mind if we go?
- Now? But we've only just arrived.

188
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,375
We're all going down
to the club later.

189
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,377
I told Sylvia
I wasn't up to this party.

190
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,414
We can be social some other time.
Will you excuse us?

191
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:53,007
Mavis, Mr. Bradshaw, Colonel.

192
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,690
It's good to see you, David Boyeur.

193
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,227
It's nice seeing you again, Miss Norman.

194
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,854
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.

195
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,297
As a matter of fact,
you were 12 years old at the time.

196
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,335
It was a party given for the children
out at St. James lawn.

197
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,304
- And you won a prize.
- Oh, I did? What for?

198
00:16:14,406 --> 00:16:16,306
The obstacle race.

199
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:19,536
I haven't been much
of a prizewinner since.

200
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:23,172
As a matter of fact, I remember
watching you from the kitchen window.

201
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:28,845
It wasn't much of a prize.
Lamb's tales from Shakespeare.

202
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:30,979
You've won bigger.

203
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,990
Perhaps.

204
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,852
Oh, excuse me.
Just one more question, Mr. Boyeur.

205
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:41,364
What would you say
is the most important problem on the island?

206
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:49,800
Color, Mr. Bradshaw. Color.

207
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,808
Would you excuse me?

208
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,448
We'd better take the sea road.

209
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,412
Aren't you coming?

210
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:39,753
I feel like staying here for a while.

211
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,053
Beautiful night, don't you think?

212
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:47,257
What sort of a mood
are you in now?

213
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:51,564
So you and your friend Carson
think I ought to go into politics?

214
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,638
I think what you did
at the party was stupid...

215
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,503
deliberately insulting
David Boyeur that way.

216
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,668
- He can be dangerous.
- So can I.

217
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:03,441
Forget Boyeur. Let's talk about Carson.
He's interesting, don't you think?

218
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:07,713
War record. Bachelor.
The sort of thing that women go for.

219
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,982
- Hilary's nice.
- If I were a woman...

220
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,184
I'd prefer Carson
to Euan Templeton.

221
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,955
But it was Euan
all the girls chased after.

222
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,121
Too bad you can't
try your luck with him.

223
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,433
I know you.

224
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:26,834
You envy Jocelyn, or any other girl who's free,
because you wish you were.

225
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,998
That's true, isn't it?

226
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,008
Maxwell, stop it.
You'll tear my dress.

227
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,739
Do you know,
I've never torn a dress of yours.

228
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,678
- Take me home.
- Home?

229
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,587
Women get bored making love in the same room.
A change of scenery helps.

230
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,128
Stop it.

231
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,315
Tell me about Egypt.
Was it madly dull?

232
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,552
Too many pyramids.

233
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,629
And not enough girls?

234
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,426
None to write home about.

235
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,865
Do you think there'll be
any punch left in that thermos?

236
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,868
Mm-hmm.

237
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,884
- Cold enough?
- Uh-huh.

238
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:56,790
What's your life
like here? Gay?

239
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:59,056
Not very.

240
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:02,258
This is a small island,
and there's a dozen girls like myself.

241
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,494
And not enough men.

242
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:09,540
Oh, the boats come in sometimes-
tourists, sailors.

243
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,603
Ever think of getting away?

244
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:17,273
- Constantly.
- Where?

245
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:21,785
I don't know.
Paris. London.

246
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,481
It doesn't really matter.

247
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,218
You know, you get awfully tired
of all this sun.

248
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:31,122
What will you do
when you leave Oxford?

249
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,658
I've got a seat waiting for me
in the House of Lords.

250
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:37,758
Ah, I forgot.
You've a title.

251
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:39,769
Don't say it like that.

252
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:41,771
You know,
there was a corporal in the army.

253
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:46,037
He used to take a peculiar pleasure
out of reading my name out in full-

254
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:49,807
"Private the Honorable
Lord Templeton E.J., number 6139."

255
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,942
I suppose it did sound funny.

256
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:59,450
When I was in Egypt,
I used to lie out on the beach...

257
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:02,220
close my eyes
and make a prayer to Allah.

258
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,362
"Please, Allah," I'd say.

259
00:21:05,464 --> 00:21:10,333
"When I open my eyes, may there be
a pretty girl lying on the sand next to me.

260
00:21:12,237 --> 00:21:14,137
Thank you, Allah."

261
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,733
Hello.

262
00:21:45,003 --> 00:21:47,972
- I want some toothpaste.
- What kind?

263
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,541
- Any one of those will do.
- The large or the small?

264
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,149
What's the difference in price?

265
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,412
The large is 36.
The small is 24.

266
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,420
I'll- I'll take the large.

267
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,158
Miss Seaton, are you going
to the nurses' dance with anyone?

268
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:16,723
- David Boyeur asked me.
- And if I asked you?

269
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:19,736
Are you?

270
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:23,171
I'm afraid he'll have
to find someone to take your place.

271
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:25,300
As a matter of fact, I, uh-

272
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,210
- I have an official invitation here.
- What does it say?

273
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,646
It says, " His Excellency, the Governor,
requests the pleasure...

274
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,184
"of Miss Margot Seaton's company at his table...

275
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,846
on Tuesday, March the 15th, at 8:00 p.m."

276
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:43,294
I'll call for you myself.

277
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,758
Oh, you forgot your change.

278
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,559
Rita. Have you finished
with my wife yet?

279
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:19,289
Sorry. Your wife is not here.
She was here early today...

280
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,298
but her appointment
is for tomorrow.

281
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,528
- Oh, did she say where she was going?
- No.

282
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:41,945
Darling, I'm sorry.
Have you been waiting long?

283
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:43,953
I told Maxwell
I'd be at the hairdressers...

284
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:46,489
and then it turned out
my appointment wasn't until tomorrow.

285
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:49,059
Bit of luck your wife ran into me.

286
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:52,130
Hilary's been awfully sweet.
I insisted he come shopping with me.

287
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:54,130
Was it very boring?

288
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,826
Well, they say women have only two passions,
and one of them's shopping.

289
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,233
- Why did you buy?
- A bikini.

290
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:01,271
- It's really something, isn't it?
- Right.

291
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,864
You'd better rope off the beach, old man,
when she wears it.

292
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:06,000
We'd better be going.

293
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,479
Lucky shot running
into Hilary Carson, wasn't it?

294
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,607
Yes.

295
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:15,914
- Does he still smoke those cigarettes of his?
- What cigarettes?

296
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,012
You remember those fancy,
gold-tipped ones...

297
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,023
that he has made up
for him in Cairo.

298
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,889
Perhaps that's what I need to be
more successful with my own wife-

299
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,894
a special brand of tobacco.

300
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,123
I don't know what you're talking-

301
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,305
If I remember,
you're a friend of David Boyeur's.

302
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:13,070
- Yes, I am.
- He's a young man for whom I prophesy a brilliant future.

303
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,078
You must all be very proud of him.

304
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,910
Well, that's what he keeps telling us.
We should be.

305
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:22,544
Denis tells me you're working
at the Bon Marche pharmacy.

306
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:25,282
- Denis?
- Denis Archer, my A.D.C.

307
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,689
- Oh, yes.
- Confidentially, he's not much of an A.D.C.

308
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,728
You know, odd sort of fellow-
writes books.

309
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,821
He's very ambitious.
I like him.

310
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,758
I'm very ambitious too.

311
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,894
I'm a stenographer.

312
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,803
I've been taking
shorthand and typing.

313
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,308
I'm a qualified stenographer.

314
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,708
I suppose you haven't
a place for me?

315
00:25:47,812 --> 00:25:49,712
Well-

316
00:25:52,817 --> 00:25:55,115
I had no idea you danced so well.

317
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,120
Thank you, Miss Seaton.

318
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,315
Thank you,
Your Excellency.

319
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:10,098
It's a great honor to dance
with the governor, you know.

320
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:13,068
- Yes. Now I know all about you.
- Oh?

321
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:18,264
- What did he say?
- Odd fellow-writes books.

322
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:22,540
Confidentially, you're not a very good A.D.C.

323
00:26:22,647 --> 00:26:25,377
You're too ambitious.
But he likes you.

324
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,520
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me.

325
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:33,523
Don't go away.

326
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,123
I'll be back.

327
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,128
I won't go away.

328
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:53,436
So that's the reason you didn't go
to the nurses' ball with me, huh?

329
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:58,175
- I warned you, didn't I?
- About what?

330
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,377
That you might regret
making me go to the governor's party.

331
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,729
Aren't you drinking?

332
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,730
You do drink champagne,
don't you?

333
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:17,825
I mean, it's- it's not forbidden
to union officials, is it?

334
00:27:19,037 --> 00:27:21,631
No, I don't think so.

335
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:24,607
All right then.
Come along then.

336
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:27,234
Champagne goes
awfully quickly at parties.

337
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,344
Excuse me, ladies.
Excuse me.

338
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,350
Of course, sir.

339
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,526
Mr. Boyeur is having champagne too.

340
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:48,758
I was asking
the police about you.

341
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:52,030
- The police?
- Mmm. Colonel Whittingham.

342
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,037
We were sitting
at the same table.

343
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:57,598
What'd the colonel
have to say?

344
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:01,406
Young chap, no background,
fighting his way-

345
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,141
no idea where he wants to go, except up.

346
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:08,015
The colonel also seems to think
you like the idea of your own importance.

347
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,484
The colonel seems to think.

348
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,752
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

349
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:18,620
Then why are you
trying to find out?

350
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,630
I don't know that either.

351
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:26,530
Does it make any difference,
having an aim in life?

352
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:31,236
- An aim?
- Not just floating about-

353
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:34,106
tea at 5:00, dinner at 8:00,
Tuesdays at the hairdresser's.

354
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:37,340
Having- Oh, I used to
know the word for it-

355
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:39,610
a- a cause.

356
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,710
That should depend a great deal
on the person, I should imagine.

357
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:46,882
You think I'm rather useless, don't you?
Parasitic- that all women of my kind are.

358
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:50,017
Oh, no, it's true
that we don't know anything-

359
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:53,154
oh, the ground rules for tennis
or a recipe for shrimp curry...

360
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:57,462
a- a little charity nursing-
but nothing very important.

361
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,561
I wish there were
something worthwhile...

362
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:04,108
I could learn
about people, about-

363
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:09,680
There's a great deal to learn
right here on this island...

364
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,113
if you really mean it.

365
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:43,572
Oh, it's beautiful.

366
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:47,344
Used to be the summerhouse
where the governors' wives did their sewing.

367
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:56,889
I told the governor
I'd like somewhere to do my writing, and, uh-

368
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:02,564
- Oh, is this what you're writing?
- Yes.

369
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,536
- Is it a novel?
- Sort of.

370
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,039
- What's it about?
- Oh, people and places.

371
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,440
Begins in London,
and then goes on to Hong Kong...

372
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,639
Cairo, Malta, the West Indies.

373
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,777
Is that where it ends?

374
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:22,853
I haven't finished it yet.

375
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:30,025
May I read it sometime?

376
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:33,495
- If you really want to.
- Oh, yes, I do.

377
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,692
I tried writing here the night after
I met you at the garden party.

378
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,701
Yes?

379
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:41,294
I couldn't get
a sentence straight.

380
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,432
I just sat here
thinking about you.

381
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:47,878
It's a bad sign.

382
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,879
Is it?

383
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,040
Oh, somewhere,
someone once said...

384
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,914
that there's always a point
at the beginning of a love affair...

385
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,954
where a man can draw back,
where he's still safe.

386
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:02,151
Is that what
you want to be? Safe?

387
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,160
I've been in love.

388
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:09,061
Funny, I don't know
anything about you.

389
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,235
Well, what would you
like to know?

390
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:20,102
All about you. Everything.

391
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:28,016
Well, there really
isn't very much to tell.

392
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:30,747
I've lived in these islands all my life.

393
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:34,723
Trinidad, Fort-de-France, Santa Marta.

394
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,660
Does the gramophone work?

395
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,464
Yes.

396
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,569
Do you want me to play it?

397
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,573
Yes.

398
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:20,665
Margot, you know
I'm in love with you, don't you?

399
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,574
Yes.

400
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,735
You knew from the first, didn't you?

401
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,746
Yes.

402
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:50,132
- It's hot.
- Mmm.

403
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,470
- How was the trip?
- Pleasant.

404
00:32:54,572 --> 00:32:58,269
- How is Sylvia?
- Pretty, as always.

405
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,606
- I brought the plantation accounts.
- Thanks.

406
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:03,913
I've a bit of news.

407
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:07,075
I've decided to stand for the legislature
in the next election.

408
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,922
- Why?
- Why not?

409
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,925
It's no good our sitting around
saying the island is going to the dogs...

410
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,018
and not doing anything about it,
right, Mother?

411
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,098
I wasn't even aware
the island was going to the dogs.

412
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:24,532
Boyeur has got a great deal
of influence in your district.

413
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,535
Are you afraid of Boyeur too?

414
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:30,334
He represents the people, or they think he does.
It amounts to the same thing.

415
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,405
You don't think I have
a chance of winning, do you?

416
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,214
- No.
- Well, I do!

417
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:42,116
I'm not afraid of Boyeur!
I'm not afraid of opposing him!

418
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,450
Is there something to drink?
I'd like a sour.

419
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:46,455
Right.

420
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:55,924
Your father and I were talking about
taking Jocelyn to England for a while.

421
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,026
It's death for a young girl
like her on this island.

422
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:02,265
She ought to have the chance
of meeting the right people, don't you think?

423
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,501
Do you think he'd ever trust me
to run the estate single-handed?

424
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:09,546
Your father felt like that about
the election because he was concerned for you...

425
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:12,844
- what a defeat might mean to you.
- Was he?

426
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:16,249
I don't remember his ever
being concerned about me before.

427
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:19,380
I can't remember his ever
worrying whether or not I went to England...

428
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,789
whether I ever had a chance
to meet the right people.

429
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,385
All I've ever had
is this dreary island.

430
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,260
Ah, now,
you're not being fair.

431
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,960
Fair? I'm being truthful.
I know what people say.

432
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,334
I know what people think.
I know what you think. I know what he thinks.

433
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:36,999
I never lived up
to the great Fleury name.

434
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:42,568
But I might have,
if I'd gone to Oxford and Eton like Arthur did.

435
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,580
Many things might
have been different.

436
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:47,242
But instead you sent me
to school here with a load of colored brats.

437
00:34:47,351 --> 00:34:49,251
All I ever heard about was Arthur-

438
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,821
how well he was doing,
what good reports you had.

439
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,982
That's who father cared about.

440
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,720
Elder son, apple of his eye.

441
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,991
- Arthur's dead.
- No, he's not dead. He's alive.

442
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,158
Always will be for him.
And I'll always live in his shadow.

443
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,462
Charming Arthur. Modest Arthur.

444
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,869
And then Arthur
dead in the war, a- a hero.

445
00:35:08,973 --> 00:35:13,103
- Maxwell, be quiet, will you?
- All right. Father was kind.

446
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:16,044
He gave Sylvia and me Belfontaine
as a wedding present.

447
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:20,049
A decaying house out
on the God-forsaken tip of the island.

448
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:22,915
And I'm supposed to be grateful
for being Julian Fleury's son.

449
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,045
I'd have been better off
if I'd been born black.

450
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,056
Maxwell!

451
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:30,393
Here's your whiskey sour.

452
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,678
- Care for a drink?
- Love one.

453
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:02,816
- Give us one of those red ones, will you?
- Oh, look. They want some too.

454
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,054
- All right.
- Here. Want this?

455
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,859
Oh, and here's another little girl.
You come right in and have one.

456
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:09,933
Here you are. Got that?

457
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:12,366
And how about these girls?

458
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,665
- And don't forget me.
- Right.

459
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:16,672
Give us another one,
will you?

460
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,108
What was that all about?

461
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,978
There once was a man,
don't remember who...

462
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:35,718
drew up 200 different classifications
of mixed blood on this island.

463
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:39,227
Well, the children don't seem
to know about it yet, do they?

464
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,230
Not yet.

465
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,102
You've lived here all your life...

466
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,230
but I'm sure I'll show you a part
of this island that you've never seen.

467
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,677
Come on. Come on.

468
00:37:57,541 --> 00:38:00,066
- Uncle Reilly, how are you?
- Fine.

469
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:02,372
- Uncle Reilly, this is Miss Mavis.
- Hello.

470
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,380
Hello.

471
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:10,278
Eaton, Sonny, Antoine.

472
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,355
- This is Miss Norman.
- Hello, Miss Norman.

473
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,358
- Hello.
- Hello.

474
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,361
- Good cuttin', huh?
- Yes.

475
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,522
- All right. See you later.
- All right.

476
00:38:23,267 --> 00:38:25,462
Well, they all seem
to know you.

477
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:27,469
That's my business.

478
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,707
I was born in this village.

479
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,275
There's the old schoolhouse.

480
00:38:35,379 --> 00:38:38,542
The roof still leaks,
the timber's still rotten.

481
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,140
There'll be a new one there next year.

482
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,152
Back to school!

483
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:50,054
Well, they're- they're all
very proud of David Boyeur.

484
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,493
They'll be prouder.

485
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:41,368
- Hartford.
- Yes?

486
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:46,206
What are they singing?

487
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,285
It doesn't have a name, really.

488
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,911
It's a song the tourists never hear.

489
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,046
It's a work chant.

490
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,182
When the catch is bad, it's sad.

491
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:58,994
And when it's good-

492
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:01,326
well, it's like-

493
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,332
Champagne?

494
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:30,287
Yo-oh-oh

495
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:33,955
Yo-oh-oh-oh

496
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:37,928
Yo-oh-oh-oh

497
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:44,031
Yo-oh-oh, yo-oh-oh-oh

498
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:48,168
Yo-oh-oh

499
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,494
They're making masks
for the carnival.

500
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,070
You should really see them then
in the little towns.

501
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,710
Carnival. Carnival. Carnival.

502
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:45,380
Carnival. Carnival.
Carnival. Carnival.

503
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,473
Is carnival always like this?

504
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:22,040
- They're drunk with the music.
- Well, let's get out of this madhouse.

505
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,649
Sylvia and Maxwell
are staying in town.

506
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,219
The key should be in a flowerpot
on the veranda.

507
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:15,499
I suppose the servants
are all in the village running mask.

508
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:34,222
Can you smell the damp?

509
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,884
No wonder nothing lasts here.

510
00:46:37,995 --> 00:46:40,156
The worms eat
right through the furniture.

511
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:50,800
How about some tea?

512
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:52,967
That's a very good idea.

513
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,806
Sylvia's very wasteful.
We'll probably find a cake...

514
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:58,108
going quietly stale
in the bread bin.

515
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:03,578
Oh, would you mind opening
the shutters and letting some air in?

516
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,055
Yeah.

517
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:54,627
I think we should go.

518
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,638
I'll put the key back.

519
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:01,042
I hate leaving here.

520
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,979
Your brother's very lucky
to have a place like this all his own.

521
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,954
Ready?

522
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,537
Oh, would you like me to drive?

523
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:36,670
It's Maxwell's car.
It's got its idiosyncrasies, and I know them.

524
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:42,117
I suppose that's one of them.

525
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,210
You wait. It's got others.

526
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,721
Let me see.

527
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:48,723
Just a moment.

528
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:59,492
Well, now. I hate to tell you this,
but your rotor arm's gone.

529
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,628
- What?
- Your rotor arm.

530
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:04,866
- That's impossible.
- Well, come and look.

531
00:49:12,182 --> 00:49:14,673
It's been taken out.

532
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,685
Is this a carnival idea of humor?

533
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:20,580
It's somebody's idea of something.

534
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:24,993
What do you think
we should do now?

535
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:28,263
Telephone your father?

536
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:32,801
I think we'd better.

537
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:51,854
No reply?

538
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:55,857
Try again. It's carnival.
The girl on the exchange may be on a jag.

539
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,633
The line's dead.

540
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,433
It's all right here.

541
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:12,030
No electricity,
the rotor arm gone, and now this.

542
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,340
Three times can't be a coincidence.

543
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,345
What do you mean?

544
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,915
Grudges get paid off at carnival.

545
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:26,045
Against you, me...

546
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,056
or my father?

547
00:50:28,158 --> 00:50:31,559
It's Maxwell's car.
It's Maxwell's house now too.

548
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:42,262
- What's that?
- Drums, in the village.

549
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,272
They carry for miles.

550
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:50,907
We need a drink.

551
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:52,914
Yes, we do, don't we?

552
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,192
Won't they worry
at your father's?

553
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:07,229
No, it's carnival.
They won't expect me for hours.

554
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,770
I think the moon's up.

555
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:17,772
Shall we have a look at it?

556
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:33,884
What if we can't get back?

557
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:35,890
Well, the servants
will be here in the morning.

558
00:51:35,992 --> 00:51:38,517
I can send one of them
to telephone from the police station.

559
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,156
At least I'm not in Egypt.

560
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,200
Hungry?

561
00:51:45,302 --> 00:51:47,736
I noticed half a chicken pie in the icebox.

562
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:49,738
Really?

563
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,831
We might as well have supper.

564
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,842
By moonlight.

565
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,012
What about rooms?

566
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,349
Rooms?

567
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,918
If they don't come for us,
we shall have to stay.

568
00:52:04,254 --> 00:52:06,222
Any particular one you prefer?

569
00:52:08,325 --> 00:52:10,486
Why don't we toss a coin?

570
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:19,901
Heads?

571
00:52:21,438 --> 00:52:23,338
Heads it is.

572
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,576
Which?

573
00:52:30,113 --> 00:52:32,081
The one on the right.

574
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:36,516
I've never slept in it, and I've always
wanted to ever since I was a child.

575
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:39,587
It has a lovely view.

576
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:44,092
There's a clock on the mantelpiece
and a picture between the bookshelves.

577
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:46,856
And I promised myself I'd sleep in it
on my 17 th birthday...

578
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:48,863
but I never have, not once.

579
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,794
Wasn't it lucky I won the toss?

580
00:53:16,624 --> 00:53:20,651
Well, I suppose
there's bound to be some sort of gossip.

581
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:24,530
- Why?
- Oh, my dear...

582
00:53:24,632 --> 00:53:28,762
you can hardly expect them not to
with such a wonderful opportunity.

583
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:32,806
- Euan slept in the-
- I'm quite sure that Euan was a gentleman.

584
00:53:32,907 --> 00:53:35,432
I was simply concerned with the thought...

585
00:53:35,543 --> 00:53:38,671
that Lord Templeton might
find himself involved in unpleasantness.

586
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,680
- Mrs. Fleury?
- Mmm?

587
00:53:40,782 --> 00:53:44,047
I wonder if you'd be kind enough
to give me an opinion.

588
00:53:44,152 --> 00:53:49,112
Do you think it would be a good idea for someone
like myself to be married here, or in England?

589
00:53:50,325 --> 00:53:53,158
Why, I don't quite know.

590
00:53:53,261 --> 00:53:56,196
I think England might be quite nice,
but it might be more fun here.

591
00:53:56,297 --> 00:53:59,528
You know, it'd be a sort of holiday,
another carnival, sort of.

592
00:54:01,202 --> 00:54:05,104
Euan, you know
you don't have to.

593
00:54:05,206 --> 00:54:07,868
This isn't England,
and Mother isn't Queen Victoria.

594
00:54:09,711 --> 00:54:11,611
Well, what am I supposed
to tell my father?

595
00:54:11,713 --> 00:54:13,613
- Your father?
- Yes.

596
00:54:13,715 --> 00:54:16,309
I spoke to him
on the phone, and I said-

597
00:54:17,852 --> 00:54:19,752
You are, aren't you?

598
00:54:21,622 --> 00:54:23,647
I am what?

599
00:54:23,758 --> 00:54:25,851
In love with me?

600
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,155
Because that's what
I told my father on the-

601
00:54:28,262 --> 00:54:32,096
I mean, I- I said I was in love with you,
and I- I assumed you were with me.

602
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,658
What did he say?

603
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:38,136
Couldn't wish me a happier fate.

604
00:54:40,108 --> 00:54:45,546
- You know, it's not 24 hours since we drove to Belfontaine.
- I know.

605
00:54:45,646 --> 00:54:48,672
You were going to Oxford.
This was just a short vacation.

606
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:52,010
Marriage isn't
what you want, Euan.

607
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:54,020
Well, it's true that when
I first came here...

608
00:54:54,122 --> 00:54:56,386
I wasn't sort of looking
for anything that went deep.

609
00:54:56,491 --> 00:54:59,119
No, a good time,
that was all I wanted.

610
00:54:59,227 --> 00:55:01,889
But this morning,
when we drove back into town I thought-

611
00:55:05,466 --> 00:55:09,698
If I lost you now,
I'd be a large fool.

612
00:55:09,804 --> 00:55:13,831
As a matter of fact, I have an odd feeling,
you know, that my life wouldn't be-

613
00:55:13,941 --> 00:55:17,468
Well, it'd be sort of empty if I went back
to England and you weren't there to go with me.

614
00:55:24,452 --> 00:55:27,615
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

615
00:55:27,722 --> 00:55:30,748
Your daughter's
just been proposed to, Mr. Fleury.

616
00:55:30,858 --> 00:55:33,383
- By whom?
- Me, I'm afraid.

617
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:39,329
Euan, would you mind leaving?
I'd like to talk to my parents alone.

618
00:55:41,736 --> 00:55:43,761
I'll see you later.

619
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,771
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

620
00:55:48,576 --> 00:55:52,034
If you're in love with him, I see no reason
why you shouldn't accept him.

621
00:55:52,146 --> 00:55:54,046
After all, you won't
be any hindrance...

622
00:55:54,148 --> 00:55:56,946
as far as his going up to Oxford
and his career is concerned.

623
00:55:58,953 --> 00:56:01,888
You haven't said yet whether
you are in love with him.

624
00:56:01,989 --> 00:56:05,891
Oh. Yes, I think so.

625
00:56:05,993 --> 00:56:08,587
I mean, very much.

626
00:56:08,696 --> 00:56:12,496
But it's not quite that simple.
Euan has a name.

627
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:16,559
He has duties and obligations.
I have to be quite certain.

628
00:56:18,406 --> 00:56:21,773
Is there any reason
why I shouldn't marry him?

629
00:56:21,876 --> 00:56:24,140
What do you mean?
What reason could there be?

630
00:56:27,715 --> 00:56:32,118
Daddy, is there any reason
why I shouldn't marry Euan?

631
00:56:34,589 --> 00:56:38,252
No. There's no good reason
why you shouldn't marry him.

632
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:52,295
Oh. Put it down there.

633
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,380
Oh, hello, Bradshaw.

634
00:57:01,482 --> 00:57:04,246
Oh, hello, Mr. Fleury.
Hot, isn't it?

635
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:38,846
- Here's your paper, Mr. Fleury.
- Thank you, boy.

636
00:58:04,378 --> 00:58:07,313
"The Fleury family is a perfect example
of the problems faced...

637
00:58:07,415 --> 00:58:09,713
"by many of the old families
on this island.

638
00:58:09,817 --> 00:58:12,377
"For 300 years, there has been
marriage and intermarriage...

639
00:58:12,486 --> 00:58:15,421
"with nobody sure
of their precise ancestry.

640
00:58:15,523 --> 00:58:21,120
"But a veil of secrecy, whispers and innuendo
has been drawn across this problem.

641
00:58:22,296 --> 00:58:25,493
"Julian Fleury was
brought up in England.

642
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:29,127
"A distinguished Wessex family
was delighted 35 years ago...

643
00:58:29,236 --> 00:58:32,694
"when he proposed marriage
to their youngest daughter.

644
00:58:32,807 --> 00:58:36,243
"Presumably, they did not know
that Julian Fleury's mother...

645
00:58:36,344 --> 00:58:40,041
who died in childbirth,
was a Jamaican with colored ancestry."

646
00:58:44,251 --> 00:58:46,151
Is it true?

647
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:02,769
It's true.

648
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:05,634
What were you lashing out at
when you tried to slap me?

649
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:07,867
Your own guilt?
Your betrayal of us?

650
00:59:07,975 --> 00:59:10,273
- Betrayal? Your mother never knew.
- She knew.

651
00:59:10,378 --> 00:59:13,814
- Didn't you, Mother?
- Yes, I knew.

652
00:59:13,914 --> 00:59:15,814
But how?

653
00:59:15,916 --> 00:59:18,680
An anonymous letter.
It came years ago.

654
00:59:19,954 --> 00:59:22,923
- And you never mentioned it.
- I saw no reason to.

655
00:59:23,024 --> 00:59:25,322
I wanted to keep things
as they were.

656
00:59:25,426 --> 00:59:28,589
- Faithful wife, noble mother-
- Maxwell, stop it!

657
00:59:28,696 --> 00:59:30,687
How do you
expect him to feel?

658
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:32,766
How do you think I feel?

659
00:59:32,867 --> 00:59:36,098
To believe that you belong
to one kind of a world, and then, suddenly-

660
00:59:39,407 --> 00:59:43,605
When I asked you if there was any reason
why I shouldn't marry Euan, you said no.

661
00:59:43,711 --> 00:59:45,906
I said there was
no good reason.

662
00:59:46,013 --> 00:59:50,541
How can you say that?
Euan's heir to a title.

663
00:59:50,651 --> 00:59:54,212
Can you picture a black man
sitting in the House of Lords if we had a son?

664
00:59:54,321 --> 00:59:56,585
There's no need to exaggerate.

665
00:59:56,691 --> 00:59:58,659
My mother was three-quarters white.

666
00:59:58,759 --> 01:00:00,886
I've only 1/16 of colored blood.

667
01:00:00,995 --> 01:00:04,192
The chances are your children
will be completely white!

668
01:00:06,801 --> 01:00:11,704
Bradshaw was right.
All this whispering, all this secrecy.

669
01:00:15,209 --> 01:00:17,109
How shall I face it here?

670
01:00:18,879 --> 01:00:22,178
Will you listen to me,
quietly, for a minute?

671
01:00:22,283 --> 01:00:27,414
At the start of any misfortune, one always
feels that the end of the world has come.

672
01:00:27,521 --> 01:00:29,853
Well, the end of mine has.

673
01:00:29,957 --> 01:00:33,825
Perhaps I ought to leave this island, take
Sylvia with me, make a fresh start somewhere.

674
01:00:33,928 --> 01:00:37,625
- Do you think that'd be best?
- Do I have any other choice?

675
01:00:37,732 --> 01:00:39,632
I can see myself
walking into the club.

676
01:00:39,734 --> 01:00:42,294
Anybody for tennis?
There's Fleury.

677
01:00:42,403 --> 01:00:45,895
He's perfect for mixed-doubles.
His grandmother's a bit on the dark side, you know.

678
01:00:46,006 --> 01:00:48,873
Your roots are here.
Your life is here.

679
01:00:48,976 --> 01:00:53,310
Oh, it's easy to talk about making a fresh start.
But what would you do?

680
01:00:53,414 --> 01:00:55,382
Where would you go?

681
01:00:55,483 --> 01:00:58,941
What do the Fleurys know
except how to run a plantation?

682
01:01:00,888 --> 01:01:03,482
Nothing.

683
01:01:03,591 --> 01:01:07,027
Think it over.
Talk to Sylvia.

684
01:01:07,128 --> 01:01:09,028
Think it over.
Talk to Sylvia.

685
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:12,258
Now, above all,
we must keep our heads.

686
01:01:12,366 --> 01:01:15,164
The great thing is
to do nothing hasty.

687
01:01:15,269 --> 01:01:18,102
Behave as though nothing
extraordinary has happened.

688
01:01:18,205 --> 01:01:21,436
Otherwise people will say,
"Oh, look at the Fleurys.

689
01:01:21,542 --> 01:01:24,409
They daren't
hold their heads up in public."

690
01:01:24,512 --> 01:01:27,447
Go to the club tonight.
Behave naturally.

691
01:01:27,548 --> 01:01:31,211
Don't avoid people, and, uh,
don't send them too many drinks.

692
01:01:31,318 --> 01:01:36,255
No. I won't come. I don't want it
to look as if the clan was mustering in force.

693
01:01:37,212 --> 01:01:39,806
But behave as though
nothing had happened.

694
01:01:39,914 --> 01:01:43,247
- Lunch is ready, ma'am.
- Thank you, Mary.

695
01:02:01,436 --> 01:02:03,495
Congratulations.

696
01:02:03,605 --> 01:02:07,006
That was a fine series of articles,
the best things I've read about the island.

697
01:02:07,108 --> 01:02:09,542
As for that one today,
that was- that was the goods.

698
01:02:09,644 --> 01:02:11,544
You said things
that needed saying.

699
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:15,275
From my point of view,
I can't tell you how grateful I am.

700
01:02:15,383 --> 01:02:17,749
- In what way?
- In every way.

701
01:02:19,187 --> 01:02:21,155
I've not been trusted.
The people here, West Indian...

702
01:02:21,256 --> 01:02:25,784
they thought of me as a Fleury, a feudal planter,
bought their ancestors in the marketplace.

703
01:02:25,894 --> 01:02:30,354
But now? I'm standing for the legislature.
Why not?

704
01:02:30,465 --> 01:02:35,528
I combine black and white, the new and the old.
I've a foot in both camps.

705
01:02:35,637 --> 01:02:37,696
And your article gave me
the guts that I needed.

706
01:02:37,806 --> 01:02:41,606
- What'll it be, gentlemen?
- Rum and, uh, ginger. Two of them.

707
01:02:41,710 --> 01:02:43,610
Just water.

708
01:02:43,712 --> 01:02:46,840
I didn't see this before. But now I can
look out at those faces and I can say to them...

709
01:02:46,948 --> 01:02:49,849
"My grandmother was
of African ancestry.

710
01:02:49,951 --> 01:02:52,476
She came over in a slave trader
just as yours did."

711
01:02:52,587 --> 01:02:56,148
Yes, I can say to them,
"I'm one of you now."

712
01:02:59,928 --> 01:03:02,021
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

713
01:03:32,193 --> 01:03:34,957
- Hello.
- I want to talk to you.

714
01:03:36,231 --> 01:03:38,825
You do?
Who the devil are you?

715
01:03:38,933 --> 01:03:41,231
Fleury, Maxwell Fleury.

716
01:03:41,336 --> 01:03:44,271
Ah. Oh, so you are.

717
01:03:44,372 --> 01:03:47,398
What do you want to do?
Make a contribution to the Belfontaine Fund?

718
01:03:47,509 --> 01:03:49,875
- What?
- The fund-The Belfontaine Fund.

719
01:03:49,978 --> 01:03:52,003
I want to talk to you... alone.

720
01:03:52,113 --> 01:03:54,274
There's something that needs
settling between us.

721
01:03:54,382 --> 01:03:58,751
I can't think what.
Anyway, whatever it is, let's do it inside.

722
01:04:23,478 --> 01:04:27,505
- Are you expecting a girl?
- A girl? What would I want with a girl?

723
01:04:34,088 --> 01:04:35,988
Excuse me.

724
01:04:40,061 --> 01:04:42,291
Shall we go in here?

725
01:04:49,771 --> 01:04:52,171
- Make you a whiskey?
- No.

726
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:58,404
No, I don't believe in chaps
drinking themselves to death.

727
01:04:58,513 --> 01:05:00,947
Leave that for retired colonels.

728
01:05:01,049 --> 01:05:02,949
Remember that song?

729
01:05:16,364 --> 01:05:19,561
You know, I was once married, Fleury.

730
01:05:19,667 --> 01:05:22,431
It was in hospital
in Tripoli during the war.

731
01:05:22,537 --> 01:05:25,028
My wife fell in love
with a Polish musician...

732
01:05:25,139 --> 01:05:28,006
and thought that the best thing
for both of us was a quick divorce.

733
01:05:28,109 --> 01:05:33,376
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Mean? Nothing. It's just a fact.

734
01:05:33,481 --> 01:05:37,417
A second chance-That's what a man needs,
a blasted second chance.

735
01:05:38,987 --> 01:05:41,888
Well, what was it needed settling?

736
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:45,517
- I want you to leave my wife alone.
- Your wife?

737
01:05:45,627 --> 01:05:47,925
I'm not a fool. The trouble is
you weren't smart enough.

738
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:51,192
- The whole place stank of those fancy cigarettes of yours!
- Are you out of your mind?

739
01:05:51,299 --> 01:05:54,166
I've had as much as I can take from you
and this island. Do you understand?

740
01:05:54,269 --> 01:05:56,567
- Stay away from my wife.
- Look here. I'm fed up with idiots.

741
01:05:56,671 --> 01:05:59,299
- Are you suggesting I've been making passes-
- I'm not suggesting anything.

742
01:05:59,407 --> 01:06:02,308
- I'm just telling you.
- Then you can ruddy-well untell it and apologize.

743
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:04,776
And get this into your stupid skull.

744
01:06:04,879 --> 01:06:08,337
I don't make passes at wives
of acquaintances, and I don't share my women.

745
01:06:08,449 --> 01:06:12,010
And even if I did, I wouldn't take something
from someone like you...

746
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,520
with a tarbrush rubbed across his face.

747
01:06:18,393 --> 01:06:21,226
Tarbrush! I'll show all of you!

748
01:06:21,329 --> 01:06:24,662
Tarbrush! Tarbrush!

749
01:06:28,102 --> 01:06:31,435
Tarbrush! Tarbrush!

750
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:52,426
Carson?

751
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,700
Carson.

752
01:10:09,357 --> 01:10:12,986
- I suppose there's no doubt
about it being murder?

753
01:10:13,094 --> 01:10:15,460
No, not the slightest.

754
01:10:15,563 --> 01:10:18,999
- Anyone in England to whom we can send a cable?
- Not that I know of, sir.

755
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,625
Uh, we could, of course,
put a notice in the Times.

756
01:10:21,736 --> 01:10:23,704
Yes. That's the least we can do.

757
01:10:25,206 --> 01:10:27,140
Was there a woman in the case,
do you think?

758
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:33,005
- Politics?
- No.

759
01:10:33,114 --> 01:10:35,014
A thief, then.

760
01:10:38,286 --> 01:10:41,278
All right, that's your affair.
I won't meddle.

761
01:10:41,389 --> 01:10:45,485
It seems a bit sad, though,
a chap's life ending like that.

762
01:10:45,593 --> 01:10:48,426
You'll see to it, won't you,
that he's put under with full military honors?

763
01:10:48,529 --> 01:10:50,429
- Of course, sir.
- That will be all, sir?

764
01:10:50,531 --> 01:10:52,431
Yes, that's all.

765
01:10:55,303 --> 01:10:57,203
Good-bye, Colonel.

766
01:11:00,575 --> 01:11:04,773
I suppose this business of Bradshaw's article
is all over Jamestown.

767
01:11:04,879 --> 01:11:07,370
- That and Carson's death.
- Yes, sir.

768
01:11:08,783 --> 01:11:11,650
- What's your opinion, Denis?
- About what, sir?

769
01:11:11,752 --> 01:11:14,550
Having the wrong
sort of grandmother.

770
01:11:14,655 --> 01:11:18,785
Well, um, it's difficult to
pick one's ancestors, sir.

771
01:11:18,893 --> 01:11:21,885
Yes. It is, isn't it?

772
01:11:21,996 --> 01:11:25,124
Send a girl in, will you?
I want to dictate a note to Whitehall.

773
01:11:26,167 --> 01:11:28,067
Right, sir.

774
01:11:32,173 --> 01:11:34,664
The governor has some dictation.
Would you go in to him?

775
01:11:38,145 --> 01:11:41,205
I finished the letter to London.
Is it all right?

776
01:11:44,685 --> 01:11:46,949
I've never known
anyone like you.

777
01:11:47,054 --> 01:11:49,648
I never suspected
there could be anything like this.

778
01:11:52,126 --> 01:11:54,060
You're not wearing it.

779
01:11:54,161 --> 01:11:56,129
Well, should I?
Here, in the office?

780
01:11:56,230 --> 01:11:58,164
Wear it.

781
01:12:02,169 --> 01:12:04,069
Here. Let me.

782
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,380
You didn't look at the letter.

783
01:12:14,482 --> 01:12:18,145
The letter? It's perfect.

784
01:12:57,258 --> 01:13:01,354
Jocelyn, I've got the car.
Would you like to come for a drive?

785
01:13:01,462 --> 01:13:04,295
Why don't you, Jocelyn?
We'll go on alone.

786
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:09,131
Well, I- I have to go past the house
and change my clothes.

787
01:13:09,236 --> 01:13:11,136
All right.

788
01:13:18,979 --> 01:13:21,209
- Hello, Colonel.
- Hello.

789
01:13:21,315 --> 01:13:23,215
Mr. Bradshaw.

790
01:13:24,752 --> 01:13:27,312
Appalling thing. Carson.

791
01:13:28,356 --> 01:13:30,620
He and I were quite good friends.

792
01:13:30,725 --> 01:13:32,693
I can't understand how it happened.

793
01:13:34,295 --> 01:13:36,889
Is there anyone you suspect, Colonel Whittingham?

794
01:13:36,997 --> 01:13:40,194
Now, Mrs. Fleury, you know policemen.
They suspect everybody.

795
01:13:40,301 --> 01:13:42,235
What time did it happen?

796
01:13:42,336 --> 01:13:44,463
The coroner puts it
at about 10:00.

797
01:13:44,572 --> 01:13:48,440
That's odd.
I went to the club after I left Father's.

798
01:13:48,542 --> 01:13:51,602
I was worrying about Bradshaw's article,
how they'd take it.

799
01:13:51,712 --> 01:13:54,203
I may have passed Carson's house,
at the very moment-

800
01:13:54,315 --> 01:13:57,182
How awful. You might
have saved his life.

801
01:13:57,284 --> 01:14:00,742
A few minutes earlier, I might have met him
in the street. We'd have stopped and talked.

802
01:14:00,855 --> 01:14:04,416
He'd have asked me in for a drink,
and then we'd have found this-

803
01:14:04,525 --> 01:14:07,187
- I suppose it was a thief.
- Quite likely.

804
01:14:07,294 --> 01:14:10,092
Maxwell, on your way to the club,
Bradshaw mentioned the time...

805
01:14:10,197 --> 01:14:13,325
and it occurred to me that you might have
passed Carson's house.

806
01:14:13,434 --> 01:14:15,402
Uh, did you see anybody
hanging about outside?

807
01:14:15,503 --> 01:14:17,733
See anybody? No.

808
01:14:17,838 --> 01:14:20,568
There was a car
that drove by afterward.

809
01:14:20,674 --> 01:14:23,142
Afterward? After what?

810
01:14:23,244 --> 01:14:25,303
After I passed Carson's house.

811
01:14:25,413 --> 01:14:28,610
I'm sorry I can't be of more help, Colonel.

812
01:14:28,716 --> 01:14:30,946
- Do you think she'll care, Colonel?
- Who?

813
01:14:31,051 --> 01:14:33,383
The ex-Mrs. Carson.
He was very much in love with her, you know.

814
01:14:33,487 --> 01:14:35,387
I couldn't say.

815
01:14:35,489 --> 01:14:38,652
- Poor man. He came out here with such high hopes.
- Mmm.

816
01:14:38,759 --> 01:14:42,525
Well, a chap can't pick the way he'll die,
or we'd all do better at it.

817
01:14:42,630 --> 01:14:44,530
Good-bye, Colonel.

818
01:15:01,849 --> 01:15:05,114
- Here, Colonel, sir.
- Right. Out you get.

819
01:15:05,219 --> 01:15:08,814
I steal nothing, Colonel, sir.
I find purse in cane field.

820
01:15:08,923 --> 01:15:12,359
No money in purse. I keep purse.
Why not keep purse, Colonel, sir?

821
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:14,360
Now, don't fuss.
Nobody's blaming you.

822
01:15:14,462 --> 01:15:17,431
You just show me where you found that purse,
then you can go home.

823
01:15:26,674 --> 01:15:28,574
What? No further than that?

824
01:15:28,676 --> 01:15:31,076
No, Colonel, sir.
I found purse right here.

825
01:15:31,178 --> 01:15:33,078
Right.

826
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:37,950
All right. Bring it back.

827
01:15:41,922 --> 01:15:43,822
All right. Start it up.

828
01:15:45,292 --> 01:15:48,386
No, no. You stay there.

829
01:16:19,593 --> 01:16:21,493
Okay. Back you get.

830
01:16:26,767 --> 01:16:29,429
Drive him to his village.

831
01:16:29,537 --> 01:16:32,233
Here. This'll make up
for the day's work you lost.

832
01:16:33,541 --> 01:16:35,600
- Thank you, sir.
- Everything okay, Colonel, sir?

833
01:16:35,709 --> 01:16:37,609
Fine.

834
01:16:43,817 --> 01:16:45,717
Three.

835
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:48,720
- Oh, hello, Maxwell.
- Hello, Mavis.

836
01:16:48,822 --> 01:16:51,188
Hello, darling.

837
01:16:51,292 --> 01:16:53,192
There's some news in the paper.

838
01:16:53,294 --> 01:16:55,762
- Oh, what is it?
- They found the wallet.

839
01:16:55,863 --> 01:16:57,763
- What wallet?
- Carson's wallet. Here.

840
01:16:57,865 --> 01:16:59,765
Here. Let me see.

841
01:16:59,867 --> 01:17:02,597
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, I would.

842
01:17:02,703 --> 01:17:05,331
- How about you, Mavis?
- I'd love one.

843
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:08,533
Poor Hilary.
That's all they're talking about at the club.

844
01:17:08,642 --> 01:17:12,043
H.E. will probably get a cable
from the colonial office.

845
01:17:12,146 --> 01:17:14,046
They're worried
about the tourist trade.

846
01:17:14,148 --> 01:17:16,742
Of course, there is that
American newspaper man here.

847
01:17:16,850 --> 01:17:22,186
Well, there's one thing sure. It is a small island.
He can't run far, whoever did it.

848
01:17:27,161 --> 01:17:29,629
Tell Sylvia I had to go into town.

849
01:17:53,954 --> 01:17:55,854
Get me 621.

850
01:17:58,759 --> 01:18:01,455
Yes? Just hold on a minute.

851
01:18:01,562 --> 01:18:03,462
Oh, never mind.

852
01:18:07,301 --> 01:18:09,201
Good morning, Maxwell.

853
01:18:10,704 --> 01:18:12,604
Anything I can do for you?

854
01:18:12,706 --> 01:18:14,765
I was wondering, Colonel,
if you'd be kind enough...

855
01:18:14,875 --> 01:18:17,343
to chairman a meeting up
in my district next week.

856
01:18:17,444 --> 01:18:19,344
- I'm standing for election.
- Glad to.

857
01:18:19,446 --> 01:18:21,914
- S-Sylvia all right?
- Yes, fine.

858
01:18:22,016 --> 01:18:24,177
Good.

859
01:18:24,284 --> 01:18:27,879
Uh, I see the papers say
you've found Carson's wallet.

860
01:18:27,988 --> 01:18:29,922
Yes. Yes, Carson's papers were in it.

861
01:18:30,024 --> 01:18:32,652
- That's how we identified it.
- That was stupid.

862
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,491
- What?
- Leaving the papers. At least, I'd say it was stupid.

863
01:18:36,597 --> 01:18:39,361
Would you? Huh.
I'd say too clever.

864
01:18:40,868 --> 01:18:44,269
I ran into Bradshaw.
He's certain it was a housebreaker.

865
01:18:44,371 --> 01:18:47,397
Was he really?
I wonder why.

866
01:18:47,508 --> 01:18:49,408
Is there any other
possibility?

867
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:51,637
A policeman has to keep
his eyes open, you know.

868
01:18:51,745 --> 01:18:54,179
A chap my age
can't afford to miss a bit.

869
01:18:54,281 --> 01:18:57,079
Particularly with the governor all stirred up.

870
01:18:57,184 --> 01:19:01,143
You mean, it might have been made
to look like a thief s handiwork?

871
01:19:01,255 --> 01:19:03,348
My dear fellow,
how would I know?

872
01:19:03,457 --> 01:19:06,790
There are 15 possibilities.
I'm in the dark.

873
01:19:06,894 --> 01:19:08,794
Which is the likeliest?

874
01:19:08,896 --> 01:19:12,593
Never have preconceptions, my boy.
Open mind, that's the thing.

875
01:19:14,435 --> 01:19:16,369
- Huh.
- You mustn't look too disappointed.

876
01:19:16,470 --> 01:19:18,904
The work gets done.
Never fear.

877
01:19:19,006 --> 01:19:22,567
Let's say I've guessed
who the murderer is.

878
01:19:22,676 --> 01:19:24,576
A guess, mind you.
No more.

879
01:19:24,678 --> 01:19:28,444
Well, it wouldn't do me the slightest
of good, my dear fellow. Not the slightest.

880
01:19:28,549 --> 01:19:32,610
A court wants proof.
So, I- I just wait.

881
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:35,450
Patience, my boy.
That's the ticket.

882
01:19:35,556 --> 01:19:39,083
Yes, I know that sounds-
sounds dull to you impatient chaps...

883
01:19:39,193 --> 01:19:41,127
but that's police work.

884
01:19:41,228 --> 01:19:43,856
Oh, he'll probably play into my hands,
whoever the fellow is.

885
01:19:43,964 --> 01:19:46,057
I'm in no hurry.

886
01:19:46,166 --> 01:19:49,658
You know, I- I said something
like that to a bloke once.

887
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:52,068
I can't remember who.

888
01:19:52,172 --> 01:19:54,640
Oh, middle age, my boy,
no memory at all.

889
01:19:54,742 --> 01:19:56,903
Oh, yes. Yes, in B.G.

890
01:19:57,010 --> 01:19:59,410
That's where it was. Yes.
Yes, forgery.

891
01:19:59,513 --> 01:20:02,914
What put me on to my man
was a- a slip he made.

892
01:20:03,016 --> 01:20:05,246
Tiny one. Hardly noticed it.

893
01:20:05,352 --> 01:20:10,016
Chap said "afterward" instead of "after."

894
01:20:10,124 --> 01:20:13,423
Get the point?
Absolutely the key.

895
01:20:13,527 --> 01:20:15,620
No. No, probably not.

896
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:18,425
I suppose I didn't explain it properly.

897
01:20:18,532 --> 01:20:21,501
"Afterward." That's what gave me the clue.

898
01:20:21,602 --> 01:20:23,729
"Afterward"?

899
01:20:23,837 --> 01:20:25,737
Absolutely, my dear fellow.

900
01:20:25,839 --> 01:20:28,364
That's what
put me on the scent.

901
01:20:28,475 --> 01:20:31,911
I'm glad you dropped by.
Happy to do that chairman thing for you.

902
01:20:32,012 --> 01:20:34,913
- You ring me up the day you need it. Cheerio.
- Thank you.

903
01:20:48,228 --> 01:20:50,253
Halt!

904
01:21:10,017 --> 01:21:11,917
You're late.

905
01:21:12,019 --> 01:21:14,487
I'm sorry.
I almost didn't get here.

906
01:21:16,256 --> 01:21:18,918
- Why not?
- Oh, it doesn't matter now.

907
01:21:19,026 --> 01:21:21,517
It does to me.

908
01:21:21,628 --> 01:21:23,528
Why?

909
01:21:28,035 --> 01:21:30,697
Why did you choose
this place to meet?

910
01:21:30,804 --> 01:21:33,705
This plantation used to
belong to my family.

911
01:21:33,807 --> 01:21:37,038
It was the first on the island.

912
01:21:37,144 --> 01:21:39,271
I wanted you to see it.

913
01:21:39,379 --> 01:21:44,146
Your family?
I didn't know that.

914
01:21:44,251 --> 01:21:48,984
It was destroyed during a slave uprising
in 1843, during the French rule.

915
01:21:50,057 --> 01:21:53,220
I wonder what
could have caused it?

916
01:21:53,327 --> 01:21:55,227
Any number of reasons.

917
01:21:55,329 --> 01:21:59,231
A single insult, a whipping, a girl.
Who knows?

918
01:22:01,134 --> 01:22:03,125
Do you know what happened
to the owners?

919
01:22:11,144 --> 01:22:13,305
That was more than
a hundred years ago.

920
01:22:14,548 --> 01:22:16,982
And, now you're here,
and I'm here.

921
01:22:32,933 --> 01:22:36,334
Do you still feel that anyone whose skin
is different from yours is an enemy?

922
01:22:37,804 --> 01:22:39,795
- Do you think I do?
- I don't know.

923
01:22:39,907 --> 01:22:42,137
At carnival time,
my brother-in-law's car was damaged...

924
01:22:42,242 --> 01:22:44,142
his telephone wires cut.

925
01:22:44,244 --> 01:22:46,144
You hate Maxwell, don't you?

926
01:22:46,246 --> 01:22:48,146
You think of him as an enemy.

927
01:22:48,248 --> 01:22:52,776
I think of him as a snob,
as an arrogant plantation owner.

928
01:22:55,188 --> 01:22:57,554
Is that the reason
why you almost didn't get here?

929
01:22:59,793 --> 01:23:03,024
Or did they tell you
that you shouldn't be seen with me?

930
01:23:03,130 --> 01:23:07,362
That I'm an upstart, a nobody
who's gotten control of the union.

931
01:23:07,467 --> 01:23:11,426
That I'm a dangerous man
who should be watched carefully.

932
01:23:11,538 --> 01:23:16,168
You don't suppose I'd listen to them?
I only believe in what I see and what I know.

933
01:23:16,276 --> 01:23:18,176
Do you know what
they say about me?

934
01:23:18,278 --> 01:23:21,611
Poor Mavis Norman,
always getting into trouble.

935
01:23:23,016 --> 01:23:25,541
Always picking the wrong man.

936
01:23:43,537 --> 01:23:46,665
- Do you think of me as an enemy?
- No.

937
01:23:47,841 --> 01:23:49,741
What are you thinking?

938
01:23:52,546 --> 01:23:54,980
That you feel you're lost,
but you're not.

939
01:23:56,416 --> 01:23:59,351
Because you're looking
for something real.

940
01:23:59,453 --> 01:24:02,445
And as long as you're looking
for something real, you're not lost.

941
01:24:13,033 --> 01:24:16,196
I suppose you and your father discussed
that article of Bradshaw's?

942
01:24:16,303 --> 01:24:18,999
- Of course.
- What did he say?

943
01:24:19,106 --> 01:24:22,803
Well, he said we ought to announce
our engagement at once...

944
01:24:22,909 --> 01:24:25,810
and then have
a celebration party.

945
01:24:25,912 --> 01:24:28,745
- When did he say that?
- Last night. When he got back from Guiana.

946
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:32,550
And what did he say
about our getting married?

947
01:24:32,652 --> 01:24:34,711
"First things first," he said.

948
01:24:34,821 --> 01:24:39,849
"We can talk later about what people
in Victorian homes might call 'naming the day."'

949
01:24:42,696 --> 01:24:44,823
How neat.

950
01:24:46,266 --> 01:24:49,565
- What?
- Your father's no fool.

951
01:24:51,405 --> 01:24:53,669
I thought it was
very decent of him.

952
01:24:53,774 --> 01:24:56,072
What else could he say?

953
01:24:56,176 --> 01:24:58,076
It wouldn't be diplomatic, would it...

954
01:24:58,178 --> 01:25:01,978
for the governor to offend
the whole colored population of Santa Marta?

955
01:25:02,082 --> 01:25:07,418
Engaged. And then no one can say
that G.H. draws a color line.

956
01:25:07,521 --> 01:25:10,820
- Of course, marriage-
- I bel- My father's never lied to me.

957
01:25:10,924 --> 01:25:12,858
Do you think he'd run
the risk of having a grandson...

958
01:25:12,959 --> 01:25:15,951
an eventual heir,
who's part Negro?

959
01:25:16,063 --> 01:25:18,588
He'll see to it that you go back to England.

960
01:25:18,698 --> 01:25:20,598
Not without you.

961
01:25:24,838 --> 01:25:28,103
It doesn't matter.
The marriage isn't important anyway.

962
01:25:28,208 --> 01:25:30,108
Oh, now, Jocelyn,
we've got to get this clear.

963
01:25:30,210 --> 01:25:33,179
- Bradshaw's article won't mean anything as far-
- It's clear.

964
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:35,271
It's perfectly clear.

965
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:41,412
A romance-
isn't that what you wanted?

966
01:25:41,521 --> 01:25:46,151
Eighteen months was such
a long time in Egypt, and without a girl.

967
01:25:48,895 --> 01:25:52,160
Jocelyn, you've got to listen to me.
When we're back in England this won't mean a-

968
01:25:52,265 --> 01:25:54,165
I don't went to hear
about England.

969
01:25:55,635 --> 01:25:59,503
Whatever happens,
I want you to remember one thing.

970
01:26:01,174 --> 01:26:04,541
You'll never be more loved
than you are right now.

971
01:26:33,573 --> 01:26:35,473
What time is it?

972
01:26:37,144 --> 01:26:39,237
It's almost 8:00.

973
01:26:42,382 --> 01:26:44,850
I think we should go.

974
01:26:44,951 --> 01:26:48,910
We're going to be very happy in London,
you know, forever and ever.

975
01:26:51,291 --> 01:26:54,954
Of course.
Forever and ever.

976
01:27:28,061 --> 01:27:29,961
- Have you any Rock Hinde?
- Yes, we have.

977
01:27:30,063 --> 01:27:32,054
I'll take your Rock Hinde.

978
01:27:33,099 --> 01:27:35,067
- Yes.
- Give me some Rock Hinde.

979
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:37,796
Give me some Rock Hinde!
Give me some Rock Hinde!

980
01:27:39,172 --> 01:27:42,039
- Fish for dinner?
- Rock Hinde. You get it cheap here.

981
01:27:42,142 --> 01:27:46,135
- Oh. I must tell my wife.
- Send it up to my house.

982
01:27:46,246 --> 01:27:48,237
That election meeting
of yours is all set, I hear.

983
01:27:48,348 --> 01:27:51,146
Yes. You're coming out there, aren't you?
I'm counting on it.

984
01:27:53,286 --> 01:27:57,222
Anything new about Carson?
I mean, the man who did it?

985
01:27:57,324 --> 01:28:00,225
I've come to the conclusion
it was an accident.

986
01:28:00,327 --> 01:28:05,060
- An accident?
- Yes. Unpremeditated. A quarrel. That's what it was.

987
01:28:05,165 --> 01:28:07,861
Last thing the poor devil wanted,
Carson dead.

988
01:28:09,736 --> 01:28:14,002
If only he'd come to the police station
right away, we might have smoothed it out.

989
01:28:14,107 --> 01:28:16,575
What a fool he was.

990
01:28:16,676 --> 01:28:18,576
A fool?

991
01:28:18,678 --> 01:28:23,581
Absolutely. You see, the chap who did it,
I'm- I'm sorry for him.

992
01:28:23,683 --> 01:28:27,449
He's not strong enough
to bear the burden of his guilt.

993
01:28:27,554 --> 01:28:30,182
Ever read a book called
Crime and Punishment?

994
01:28:30,290 --> 01:28:33,487
- No. Why?
- Well, you should. It's about just this sort of thing.

995
01:28:33,593 --> 01:28:36,027
A man who has
committed a crime...

996
01:28:36,129 --> 01:28:39,326
and his relationship with a detective
who knows he's committed it...

997
01:28:39,432 --> 01:28:41,332
but still can't prove it.

998
01:28:41,434 --> 01:28:44,164
There's a-They have a-
have a secret together.

999
01:28:44,271 --> 01:28:47,138
There's a-There's
a deep bond between them.

1000
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,140
It's rather like a love affair...

1001
01:28:49,242 --> 01:28:53,804
because the detective is the only man
in the world who understands him.

1002
01:28:53,913 --> 01:28:59,146
And in his heart, the murderer wants
to be found out by the detective.

1003
01:28:59,252 --> 01:29:01,311
Now, this fellow
in the Carson case, you know...

1004
01:29:01,421 --> 01:29:03,321
what I'd like to do
is to go up to him...

1005
01:29:03,423 --> 01:29:06,392
take him by the arm
and tell him not to worry.

1006
01:29:07,661 --> 01:29:10,095
"I'll do my best for you,"
I want to say to him.

1007
01:29:10,196 --> 01:29:13,791
"I'm not out to punish you.
I'm not out to punish anyone.

1008
01:29:13,900 --> 01:29:18,837
"It's just that I've got to maintain law and order.
But I mean you no harm.

1009
01:29:18,938 --> 01:29:21,930
"We'll-We'll get it fixed
as manslaughter.

1010
01:29:22,042 --> 01:29:24,374
"That might mean
only five years...

1011
01:29:24,477 --> 01:29:26,843
"and the sentence could
be remitted for good behavior.

1012
01:29:26,946 --> 01:29:29,278
"It might be only three years.

1013
01:29:29,382 --> 01:29:31,282
"I know that sounds
a long time now, but...

1014
01:29:31,384 --> 01:29:33,978
"three years passes very quickly.

1015
01:29:34,087 --> 01:29:37,022
"Now, you look back three years.
Does it seem a long time?

1016
01:29:37,123 --> 01:29:39,148
"No, of course it doesn't.

1017
01:29:39,259 --> 01:29:42,660
"And, after all, three years
isn't such a big price to pay...

1018
01:29:42,762 --> 01:29:44,855
"for your peace of mind.

1019
01:29:44,964 --> 01:29:48,832
So, come now.
Confess. Tell me."

1020
01:29:48,935 --> 01:29:51,768
Well, that's what I'd like to say to the poor devil...

1021
01:29:51,871 --> 01:29:54,499
if he came to me.

1022
01:29:54,607 --> 01:29:56,507
Well, I'll be seeing you.

1023
01:29:56,609 --> 01:29:59,874
Oh, that book, Crime and Punishment,
I'll send it over to you.

1024
01:29:59,979 --> 01:30:03,244
When you get a chance,
you read it.

1025
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:05,250
Yes.

1026
01:30:32,212 --> 01:30:34,271
- Hello.
- Hello.

1027
01:30:34,381 --> 01:30:36,679
Good evening.

1028
01:30:36,783 --> 01:30:38,683
Excuse me.
I won't be a minute.

1029
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:53,164
Are you nervous?

1030
01:30:54,701 --> 01:30:57,499
So am I.
All these people.

1031
01:31:03,076 --> 01:31:06,409
It seems so strange and unbelievable,
our being here.

1032
01:31:06,513 --> 01:31:08,413
Do you remember the day
of the governor's party...

1033
01:31:08,515 --> 01:31:11,040
when poor Hilary Carson
suggested you run for election?

1034
01:31:12,619 --> 01:31:14,587
- I never really thought-
- I remember.

1035
01:31:15,889 --> 01:31:17,880
It must have come to his mind
that very moment...

1036
01:31:17,991 --> 01:31:21,358
because when he came out
to the house that morning-

1037
01:31:21,461 --> 01:31:23,861
- He came out to the house?
- Yes.

1038
01:31:26,299 --> 01:31:28,699
You knew Carson rather well, didn't you?

1039
01:31:29,736 --> 01:31:34,435
Well- No.
I- I wouldn't say well.

1040
01:31:34,541 --> 01:31:36,805
Why?

1041
01:31:36,910 --> 01:31:39,276
Why did he come out
to the house?

1042
01:31:39,379 --> 01:31:42,576
It had to do with
the Belfontaine Fund.

1043
01:31:42,682 --> 01:31:45,014
The Belfontaine Fund?

1044
01:31:45,118 --> 01:31:48,713
Yes, he wanted to find out
what sort of a gift your father wanted.

1045
01:31:48,822 --> 01:31:52,758
It was intended to be some sort
of token of his services to Santa Marta.

1046
01:31:52,859 --> 01:31:55,555
He said don't mention it to anybody,
particularly Maxwell.

1047
01:31:55,662 --> 01:31:57,562
It was intended as a surprise.

1048
01:31:57,664 --> 01:32:00,258
That's all. That's all it was.

1049
01:32:00,366 --> 01:32:02,357
Of course.
What did you imagine it was?

1050
01:32:05,338 --> 01:32:07,272
It's time to start.

1051
01:32:14,814 --> 01:32:16,975
May I have
your attention, please?

1052
01:32:19,686 --> 01:32:24,623
I'm here tonight as chairman of a meeting
at which Mr. Maxwell Fleury...

1053
01:32:24,724 --> 01:32:29,718
who is offering himself as your representative
in the Legislative Council...

1054
01:32:29,829 --> 01:32:32,297
will explain his position to you.

1055
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:36,367
Now, you all know Mr. Fleury.

1056
01:32:36,469 --> 01:32:41,372
Few West Indian families
bear a name as respected as his.

1057
01:32:41,474 --> 01:32:46,138
Mr. Fleury.

1058
01:32:50,016 --> 01:32:52,246
The elections for which I stand before you-

1059
01:32:59,459 --> 01:33:03,293
The election for which I-

1060
01:33:33,092 --> 01:33:36,220
Quiet! Quiet! Stop this!

1061
01:33:39,599 --> 01:33:42,227
You've all been given
a chance to vote.

1062
01:33:42,335 --> 01:33:44,667
When the time comes,
you'll use it.

1063
01:33:45,872 --> 01:33:49,273
And now, let him
use his right to speak.

1064
01:33:50,610 --> 01:33:53,010
The floor is yours, Mr. Fleury.

1065
01:34:11,497 --> 01:34:13,727
I will not speak to you
from this paper.

1066
01:34:13,833 --> 01:34:16,301
This paper is filled with words
that come from my head.

1067
01:34:16,402 --> 01:34:21,863
I- I will try to speak to you with words
that come from my heart.

1068
01:34:23,276 --> 01:34:26,336
Many of you
out there know me.

1069
01:34:26,446 --> 01:34:30,576
You've cut my sugar cane
and harvested my coffee crop.

1070
01:34:30,683 --> 01:34:32,913
And, yet, I have not known you.

1071
01:34:33,019 --> 01:34:38,184
And in this, I've failed,
as I have failed in... other things.

1072
01:34:40,126 --> 01:34:43,823
To deny this would be
to deny truth, and...

1073
01:34:43,930 --> 01:34:46,524
I will speak
to you tonight only truth.

1074
01:34:47,967 --> 01:34:50,800
I have passed you in the fields
or in the cocoa sheds...

1075
01:34:50,903 --> 01:34:55,135
and you've been just a name,
or a face, or a number in a book.

1076
01:34:56,976 --> 01:35:01,811
And I've lived in a world
through which you moved only as... shadows...

1077
01:35:01,914 --> 01:35:04,747
to be feared or ignored.

1078
01:35:04,851 --> 01:35:09,151
I've now lived in the two worlds
of Santa Marta.

1079
01:35:09,255 --> 01:35:12,486
I know how they both think,
how they both feel.

1080
01:35:14,827 --> 01:35:18,354
I also know that
they cannot exist...

1081
01:35:18,464 --> 01:35:22,332
if they're cut off from each other
by suspicion and fear...

1082
01:35:22,435 --> 01:35:25,768
each in its own loneliness...

1083
01:35:25,872 --> 01:35:30,241
as no human being can exist,
in his own loneliness.

1084
01:35:32,078 --> 01:35:37,710
This bridge I can help you build.

1085
01:35:37,817 --> 01:35:40,980
I ask for your faith, your trust.

1086
01:35:41,087 --> 01:35:44,318
Do not deny them to me.

1087
01:35:46,392 --> 01:35:49,225
I'll answer any questions
from the floor.

1088
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,301
The floor is now
open for questions.

1089
01:35:57,403 --> 01:36:00,270
I have a few, Mr. Chairman.

1090
01:36:04,210 --> 01:36:07,407
I was as moved
by Mr. Fleury's speech as anyone else.

1091
01:36:09,615 --> 01:36:13,483
And I agree when he says that the two worlds
cannot exist separate from each other.

1092
01:36:16,222 --> 01:36:18,986
The question I would like
to ask Mr. Fleury is this.

1093
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:23,657
Does he think that
the only issue here is one of color?

1094
01:36:25,264 --> 01:36:29,030
Is he saying that that is the reason
why we should vote for him?

1095
01:36:29,135 --> 01:36:32,468
Is he saying,
"Vote for me because I am one of you"?

1096
01:36:32,572 --> 01:36:36,099
Is that what
you're saying, Mr. Fleury?

1097
01:36:36,209 --> 01:36:39,337
Because if you are,
I would like to take that issue up...

1098
01:36:39,445 --> 01:36:41,470
with your permission, Mr. Chairman.

1099
01:36:44,650 --> 01:36:49,383
Mr. Fleury said he has
existed in the two worlds of Santa Marta.

1100
01:36:49,489 --> 01:36:52,390
- Which do you think he'll represent?
- I would like to answer that.

1101
01:36:52,492 --> 01:36:55,552
When I'm finished, Mr. Chairman!

1102
01:36:57,063 --> 01:36:59,258
Would Mr. Fleury
also answer this?

1103
01:36:59,365 --> 01:37:03,392
You said that you came here tonight
only to speak the truth.

1104
01:37:03,503 --> 01:37:07,337
Wouldn't it also be true to say
that the only reason that you seek the election...

1105
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:11,376
is to revenge yourself upon the whites
whom you now think despise you?

1106
01:37:11,477 --> 01:37:13,877
That the only reason
that you want to be black...

1107
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:17,438
is because you're afraid that the white world
will not let you be white anymore?

1108
01:37:17,550 --> 01:37:20,451
That you want
to use us, our votes...

1109
01:37:20,553 --> 01:37:24,512
so that you can still rule
in that world that you still belong to.

1110
01:37:24,624 --> 01:37:26,956
And tell us another truth, Mr. Fleury.

1111
01:37:27,059 --> 01:37:30,551
In your heart, deep down inside...

1112
01:37:30,663 --> 01:37:32,893
don't you still think of us as slaves?

1113
01:37:32,999 --> 01:37:34,967
- As a stupid, ignorant people?
- That's a lie!

1114
01:37:35,067 --> 01:37:38,264
No, Mr. Fleury! That is the truth!

1115
01:37:38,371 --> 01:37:41,204
And the issue here is
not just one of color.

1116
01:37:41,307 --> 01:37:45,437
The issue here is,
who is really best fit to represent the people?

1117
01:37:45,545 --> 01:37:49,072
Who knows them the best?
Who feels for them the most?

1118
01:37:49,182 --> 01:37:51,082
Who's really a part of them?

1119
01:37:51,184 --> 01:37:53,482
Is it you, Mr. Fleury, or is it me?

1120
01:37:53,586 --> 01:37:55,486
Now you may answer, Mr. Fleury.

1121
01:37:55,588 --> 01:37:58,284
- Boyeur! Boyeur!
- Boyeur!

1122
01:37:58,391 --> 01:38:00,120
Boyeur! Boyeur!

1123
01:38:00,226 --> 01:38:03,252
Boyeur! Boyeur! Boyeur!

1124
01:38:04,764 --> 01:38:07,597
David Boyeur!

1125
01:38:15,174 --> 01:38:18,974
Boyeur! Boyeur! Boyeur!

1126
01:38:29,622 --> 01:38:31,522
He's right!
I'm not one of you!

1127
01:38:31,624 --> 01:38:33,524
I don't belong to you!

1128
01:38:33,626 --> 01:38:36,527
I don't want to be one of you!
I never did!

1129
01:39:04,090 --> 01:39:09,494
All right, friends.
The meeting's over. Let's go home.

1130
01:39:33,152 --> 01:39:36,644
My comb's gone.
I must have left it. Lend me yours?

1131
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:50,892
- Am I presentable now?
- Mm-hmm.

1132
01:39:51,003 --> 01:39:53,096
What was the name of the film
we were supposed to see?

1133
01:39:53,205 --> 01:39:56,766
- Red Shoes.
- Oh. Was it good?

1134
01:39:56,876 --> 01:40:01,176
A bit long.

1135
01:40:02,214 --> 01:40:04,114
Good night, darling.

1136
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:11,022
Uh, Jocelyn...

1137
01:40:11,123 --> 01:40:13,023
there's something I want to say.

1138
01:40:13,125 --> 01:40:16,117
- Darling, can't-
- It won't take long.

1139
01:40:16,228 --> 01:40:19,857
I want us to be married
before I go back to England.

1140
01:40:19,966 --> 01:40:21,866
Why?

1141
01:40:21,968 --> 01:40:26,371
Because I've an odd feeling that
if we don't get married now, we never shall.

1142
01:40:26,472 --> 01:40:29,600
You know, you're the most difficult person
to get a wedding ring on.

1143
01:40:31,344 --> 01:40:34,745
Am I?
I'll try not to be.

1144
01:40:49,228 --> 01:40:51,128
You're up late.

1145
01:40:51,230 --> 01:40:54,825
I've been waiting for Maxwell to call.
How was the film?

1146
01:40:56,135 --> 01:40:58,194
A bit long.

1147
01:41:01,907 --> 01:41:04,808
Mother, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

1148
01:41:07,013 --> 01:41:08,913
Is there a match?

1149
01:41:09,982 --> 01:41:11,882
Fruit bowl.

1150
01:41:24,563 --> 01:41:27,259
You were saying?

1151
01:41:27,366 --> 01:41:30,130
In about three months,
I want to go to Canada.

1152
01:41:30,236 --> 01:41:32,568
I'd like to start
making the arrangements now.

1153
01:41:32,671 --> 01:41:35,265
Canada? Why on earth
do you want to go there?

1154
01:41:35,374 --> 01:41:38,172
Because I'm pregnant.

1155
01:41:38,277 --> 01:41:41,075
Does Euan know?

1156
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:43,205
You're sure that you are?

1157
01:41:43,315 --> 01:41:45,715
There isn't any doubt.

1158
01:41:45,818 --> 01:41:49,345
Well, you're certainly calm about it.

1159
01:41:49,455 --> 01:41:52,322
You might show
some shame, some guilt.

1160
01:41:52,425 --> 01:41:55,189
If it will make you feel any happier,
I feel quite guilty.

1161
01:41:57,763 --> 01:42:03,360
I thought Euan's father wouldn't let us marry,
so I settled for what there was.

1162
01:42:03,469 --> 01:42:05,960
I thought, first of all,
I'd go to Trinidad, and then I changed my mind.

1163
01:42:06,072 --> 01:42:10,372
I think Canada's the best idea.
I could have it adopted. It shouldn't be hard.

1164
01:42:12,211 --> 01:42:16,170
There's only one thing.
I shouldn't like Daddy to know.

1165
01:42:16,282 --> 01:42:18,512
He's been through enough.

1166
01:42:18,617 --> 01:42:21,711
- That's why I need your help.
- My help?

1167
01:42:21,821 --> 01:42:25,882
You care about appearances,
what people will say.

1168
01:42:25,991 --> 01:42:27,891
Thank you.

1169
01:42:29,895 --> 01:42:31,795
Of course, you know that
you've behaved stupidly.

1170
01:42:31,897 --> 01:42:35,333
You have behaved like a peasant girl
in the cane fields.

1171
01:42:35,434 --> 01:42:37,664
I suppose that's neither here nor there.

1172
01:42:37,770 --> 01:42:40,796
It's the future that matters.
May I have another match?

1173
01:42:42,875 --> 01:42:45,173
You might at least strike it.

1174
01:42:48,714 --> 01:42:50,807
You're engaged.
You can get married in a hurry.

1175
01:42:53,919 --> 01:42:56,479
You've not quarreled with him?

1176
01:42:56,589 --> 01:43:00,184
He says he wants to marry me
when he goes back to England.

1177
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:05,055
- I'm not marrying Euan.
- Why not? You're insane.

1178
01:43:06,532 --> 01:43:09,763
- You are still in love with him?
- Yes.

1179
01:43:09,869 --> 01:43:13,168
Then what on earth is there
to stop your marrying?

1180
01:43:13,272 --> 01:43:15,172
I've told you the reason.

1181
01:43:15,274 --> 01:43:18,471
Don't be ridiculous.
The English Peerage isn't that sacred.

1182
01:43:19,979 --> 01:43:24,382
Think of Euan.
Think of the jokes there'd be made about it.

1183
01:43:24,483 --> 01:43:27,350
You might have thought of that
two months ago.

1184
01:43:27,453 --> 01:43:30,479
I didn't know then about
my Jamaican grandmother.

1185
01:43:33,292 --> 01:43:38,286
- Is that the only reason why you're refusing to marry him?
- It is.

1186
01:43:40,866 --> 01:43:42,857
If you had the chance,
if things were different-

1187
01:43:42,968 --> 01:43:46,426
- No. They're not different.
- I know. I know. But supposing they were?

1188
01:43:47,740 --> 01:43:50,732
Would you give anything
to marry him?

1189
01:43:50,843 --> 01:43:52,743
Yes.

1190
01:43:54,747 --> 01:43:56,772
Very well.

1191
01:43:58,817 --> 01:44:00,876
I owe you this.

1192
01:44:02,087 --> 01:44:04,715
You need have no qualms
about marrying Euan.

1193
01:44:04,823 --> 01:44:08,657
There isn't a drop of African blood
in your veins. My husband isn't your father.

1194
01:44:15,668 --> 01:44:17,568
- Isn't?
- No.

1195
01:44:20,806 --> 01:44:22,706
Well, then who?

1196
01:44:22,808 --> 01:44:25,606
That's immaterial.
It's better you shouldn't know.

1197
01:44:27,346 --> 01:44:30,474
He's completely English.
You can rest assured of that.

1198
01:44:30,583 --> 01:44:33,450
I shall tell Lord Templeton who he is.

1199
01:44:33,552 --> 01:44:38,080
He has a right to know who will be
the other grandfather of his grandchildren.

1200
01:44:39,625 --> 01:44:42,753
Telling him will be the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

1201
01:44:44,129 --> 01:44:46,654
But it must be done.

1202
01:44:46,765 --> 01:44:49,097
He may have
your old-fashioned ideas.

1203
01:44:51,837 --> 01:44:54,499
I must ask you for the same
consideration you asked me.

1204
01:44:54,607 --> 01:44:57,303
I'd rather your father-

1205
01:45:00,346 --> 01:45:02,837
I'd rather my husband didn't know.

1206
01:45:04,883 --> 01:45:08,080
You were always so devoted.

1207
01:45:08,187 --> 01:45:11,384
I never conceived the possibility
of another man in your life.

1208
01:45:11,490 --> 01:45:16,257
Children don't.
They think mistakes are their privilege.

1209
01:45:20,366 --> 01:45:22,698
Mother-

1210
01:45:24,670 --> 01:45:27,036
I don't want you to
talk to Lord Templeton.

1211
01:45:27,139 --> 01:45:29,369
I don't want you
to tell him anything.

1212
01:45:29,475 --> 01:45:32,000
But he should know.

1213
01:45:32,111 --> 01:45:35,080
I'll tell Euan... eventually.

1214
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:38,343
But I won't have you
humiliate yourself for my sake.

1215
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:40,611
Or for Euan's...

1216
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:42,914
or even for Lord Templeton's.

1217
01:45:59,838 --> 01:46:01,738
Shall I put the car away, darling?

1218
01:46:03,108 --> 01:46:05,008
No, I'll put it away later.

1219
01:46:07,913 --> 01:46:09,813
Are you hungry?

1220
01:46:09,915 --> 01:46:11,815
Not very.

1221
01:46:11,917 --> 01:46:14,886
There's some cold lobster in the refrigerator
and a bottle of champagne.

1222
01:46:14,987 --> 01:46:17,785
We could have it upstairs.
Wouldn't you like that?

1223
01:46:17,890 --> 01:46:19,790
I suppose.

1224
01:46:23,529 --> 01:46:25,861
Do you know what
I was thinking on the way home?

1225
01:46:25,964 --> 01:46:28,660
That I've never seen snow.

1226
01:46:28,767 --> 01:46:32,294
Imagine being my age
and never seeing snow.

1227
01:46:32,404 --> 01:46:35,965
Oh, it would be so wonderful
to go to someplace after Santa Marta...

1228
01:46:36,075 --> 01:46:39,203
where they have real blizzards,
real winters.

1229
01:46:43,949 --> 01:46:45,849
When did Whittingham
send this over?

1230
01:46:45,951 --> 01:46:47,919
The other day.
I forgot to mention it to you.

1231
01:46:48,020 --> 01:46:50,887
Have you read it?

1232
01:46:50,989 --> 01:46:52,923
Yes.

1233
01:46:53,025 --> 01:46:55,721
The murderer confesses,
I suppose.

1234
01:46:55,828 --> 01:46:57,728
Yes.

1235
01:46:57,830 --> 01:47:01,231
Is he married?
The man in the book who does the murder?

1236
01:47:02,568 --> 01:47:05,935
- No, he's not married.
- Pity.

1237
01:47:06,038 --> 01:47:09,132
I might have been
tempted to read it if he were.

1238
01:47:09,241 --> 01:47:11,971
Why?

1239
01:47:12,077 --> 01:47:15,103
He wouldn't want to
hurt his wife.

1240
01:47:15,214 --> 01:47:18,741
He wouldn't want her ever to know about it
and suffer on account of it.

1241
01:47:19,985 --> 01:47:21,953
The detective knows, doesn't he?

1242
01:47:22,054 --> 01:47:25,615
I mean, in the book.
And the fellow who did it is in a trap.

1243
01:47:25,724 --> 01:47:27,783
And it's closing in,
getting tighter every day.

1244
01:47:28,994 --> 01:47:31,326
Not a chance of
ever getting out of it.

1245
01:47:36,001 --> 01:47:39,300
What about that champagne
you promised me?

1246
01:47:39,405 --> 01:47:41,498
Were you jealous
of Hilary Carson?

1247
01:47:41,607 --> 01:47:46,874
Yes. I envied him because
he was the kind of man...

1248
01:47:46,979 --> 01:47:50,312
I thought that I wanted
to be and I couldn't.

1249
01:47:50,416 --> 01:47:52,509
I thought you were
attracted to him.

1250
01:47:54,253 --> 01:47:56,153
Hilary Carson?

1251
01:47:56,255 --> 01:48:00,089
I loved you.
I thought you didn't love me.

1252
01:48:00,192 --> 01:48:02,251
I thought that
sooner or later...

1253
01:48:02,361 --> 01:48:06,024
you'd fall in love with some man
who was better suited to you.

1254
01:48:06,131 --> 01:48:10,090
I thought Carson was
that kind of a man.

1255
01:48:13,138 --> 01:48:15,106
- Maxwell.
- Yes.

1256
01:48:17,309 --> 01:48:19,209
You didn't have
anything to do with the-

1257
01:48:19,311 --> 01:48:21,871
Don't be foolish.

1258
01:48:21,980 --> 01:48:24,710
You know that
I'm incapable of killing a man.

1259
01:48:33,959 --> 01:48:35,859
I'm going upstairs.

1260
01:48:35,961 --> 01:48:38,896
I'll bring the champagne up.

1261
01:49:20,906 --> 01:49:22,806
Darling?

1262
01:49:22,908 --> 01:49:24,967
I-I'll be out in a moment.

1263
01:49:29,948 --> 01:49:32,746
I wonder when Jocelyn's
getting married.

1264
01:49:32,851 --> 01:49:36,582
Funny, a few weeks ago,
I'd have been envious of her.

1265
01:49:36,688 --> 01:49:40,818
I mean, London, a big house,
and being Lady Templeton.

1266
01:49:40,926 --> 01:49:43,019
Now it doesn't matter so much.

1267
01:49:46,865 --> 01:49:48,924
Do hurry, darling.

1268
01:49:50,536 --> 01:49:54,370
I saw a film the other day
about a little town in New England.

1269
01:49:54,473 --> 01:49:57,374
New England. That's where I'd like to live.

1270
01:49:57,476 --> 01:49:59,535
The characters in the film
lived in a little house...

1271
01:49:59,645 --> 01:50:02,546
and it had a wonderful kitchen
with all sorts of gadgets.

1272
01:50:06,184 --> 01:50:09,085
With a kitchen like that,
you don't need servants.

1273
01:50:10,255 --> 01:50:12,314
That's how I'd like to live.

1274
01:50:12,424 --> 01:50:15,587
Not in some big old house
built hundreds of years ago...

1275
01:50:15,694 --> 01:50:18,322
and getting dressed
for a lonely dinner.

1276
01:50:27,773 --> 01:50:30,298
You see? That's the sort
of woman you married.

1277
01:50:37,082 --> 01:50:38,982
Maxwell!

1278
01:50:39,084 --> 01:50:41,052
Maxwell!

1279
01:50:46,425 --> 01:50:49,758
Darling, will you call
Colonel Whittingham...

1280
01:50:49,861 --> 01:50:52,295
and tell him that I'm coming down
to see him right away?

1281
01:51:06,178 --> 01:51:08,078
I like this.

1282
01:51:09,414 --> 01:51:13,612
I've resigned.
The governor found out about us.

1283
01:51:14,653 --> 01:51:17,850
Oh? Well, what did he say?

1284
01:51:17,956 --> 01:51:20,049
He left the decision to me.

1285
01:51:20,158 --> 01:51:22,718
Oh, he talked about the book too.

1286
01:51:22,828 --> 01:51:25,160
He was disturbed about that also.

1287
01:51:25,263 --> 01:51:27,663
But this is the best thing
you've ever done.

1288
01:51:27,766 --> 01:51:31,600
Even if it's true, he said, it isn't fair
to those who've had to stay on the island.

1289
01:51:31,703 --> 01:51:35,332
Fair? It's true!

1290
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:39,001
It's so true and
so good that it hurts.

1291
01:51:41,179 --> 01:51:43,079
When are you leaving?

1292
01:51:43,181 --> 01:51:45,979
Friday.

1293
01:51:46,084 --> 01:51:49,747
- What about you?
- You needn't worry.

1294
01:51:51,423 --> 01:51:54,153
I'll be broke.
There's nothing much I've saved here.

1295
01:51:54,259 --> 01:51:56,318
And the book's a long way
from being done.

1296
01:51:57,929 --> 01:52:01,592
We've never looked ahead. We-
We never discussed anything...

1297
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:03,668
but just lived from day to day.

1298
01:52:03,769 --> 01:52:05,669
Is there something
you want to discuss?

1299
01:52:07,873 --> 01:52:10,933
Yes, there is.
Life without you.

1300
01:52:13,278 --> 01:52:17,044
Writing things you won't
be the first to read.

1301
01:52:17,149 --> 01:52:20,380
Feeling things we can't share.

1302
01:52:24,122 --> 01:52:26,181
How long would it
take you to pack?

1303
01:52:26,291 --> 01:52:28,191
But I-

1304
01:52:30,462 --> 01:52:34,592
Mmm, two hours.
I don't have very much either.

1305
01:52:35,801 --> 01:52:38,133
There's a plane leaves
for England on Friday.

1306
01:52:38,236 --> 01:52:40,136
I'll send a car for you.

1307
01:52:40,238 --> 01:52:42,866
All right.

1308
01:52:42,974 --> 01:52:47,468
You don't seem very surprised-
at our going to England together.

1309
01:52:48,847 --> 01:52:51,509
Where you go, I go.

1310
01:52:59,491 --> 01:53:02,756
May I have your attention, please?

1311
01:53:02,861 --> 01:53:04,761
This is the final call...

1312
01:53:04,863 --> 01:53:09,527
for B.W.I. A Viscount
Flight 072 to New York...

1313
01:53:09,634 --> 01:53:13,866
connecting with B.O.A.C.
Monarch to London now loading.

1314
01:53:19,144 --> 01:53:22,636
Do you mind if I don't
wait until the plane goes?

1315
01:53:22,748 --> 01:53:24,648
Sylvia's alone.

1316
01:53:24,750 --> 01:53:26,650
Good-bye.

1317
01:53:28,420 --> 01:53:31,116
Well, sir. There they go.

1318
01:53:31,223 --> 01:53:34,590
Poor Julian.
Who'd have thought a son of his?

1319
01:53:37,162 --> 01:53:39,494
What will the indictment be
against Maxwell, Colonel?

1320
01:53:39,598 --> 01:53:42,567
Well, we'll try and get it in
as manslaughter, sir.

1321
01:53:42,667 --> 01:53:46,535
I meant to have a talk
with Euan when he arrived- father to son.

1322
01:53:47,572 --> 01:53:51,030
But I never did.
Now he's married.

1323
01:53:55,213 --> 01:53:57,113
Good-bye, sir.

1324
01:54:27,846 --> 01:54:29,814
There's the plane for England.

1325
01:54:31,883 --> 01:54:35,751
In the girl's case-
Does it work the other way around?

1326
01:54:35,854 --> 01:54:40,188
I mean, Denis Archer marries Margot.
Euan marries Jocelyn.

1327
01:54:40,292 --> 01:54:45,252
But, when it's the other way around,
does it make any difference?

1328
01:54:46,398 --> 01:54:48,298
Out here, yes.

1329
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:51,892
How big is Santa Marta?
It's 50 miles long.

1330
01:54:52,003 --> 01:54:53,903
There are other countries.

1331
01:54:55,006 --> 01:54:57,531
My skin is my country.

1332
01:54:57,642 --> 01:55:02,875
Maybe the men looking at Margot
at some cocktail party in Bloomsbury...

1333
01:55:02,981 --> 01:55:04,881
or at a literary tea-

1334
01:55:04,983 --> 01:55:07,850
well, they'd envy Denis Archer.

1335
01:55:07,953 --> 01:55:12,322
Their own wives look sort of dull
when she walks into a room.

1336
01:55:12,424 --> 01:55:16,588
But if I were to walk in with you,
or a girl like you as my wife-

1337
01:55:17,929 --> 01:55:21,490
Do you care what stupid
and prejudiced people think?

1338
01:55:21,600 --> 01:55:27,061
You've never had to fight stupidity or prejudice.
Besides, I'd be a fool.

1339
01:55:27,172 --> 01:55:31,108
- Why?
- Because it would be inevitable.

1340
01:55:31,209 --> 01:55:33,234
What would be?

1341
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:39,309
That night that she'd forget herself
and call me a nigger.

1342
01:55:44,222 --> 01:55:46,417
You can't mean that.
You can't possibly mean that!

1343
01:55:47,659 --> 01:55:49,593
- No. I don't.
- Then why did you say it?

1344
01:55:51,429 --> 01:55:54,921
Because here is my world.
These are my people, and this is where I belong.

1345
01:55:56,801 --> 01:56:00,669
If I went to England, who would I be?
What would I be?

1346
01:56:00,772 --> 01:56:04,037
- David Boyeur.
- No.

1347
01:56:04,142 --> 01:56:09,774
I'd be an exile in a bowler hat,
sipping tea, and carrying a rolled umbrella...

1348
01:56:09,881 --> 01:56:13,908
talking with the other exiles about how much
we could do if we were only there.

1349
01:56:14,019 --> 01:56:16,783
But I'm here.
I don't have to go.

1350
01:56:16,888 --> 01:56:19,982
And even here,
I'd be in your way, wouldn't I?

1351
01:56:22,861 --> 01:56:24,761
Yes, you would be
in my way.

1352
01:56:24,863 --> 01:56:28,492
- Besides, they'd never understand.
- Who wouldn't?

1353
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:31,160
My own people.

1354
01:56:31,269 --> 01:56:33,294
They'd feel I betrayed them.

1355
01:56:34,506 --> 01:56:36,406
I have no choice.

1356
01:56:36,508 --> 01:56:38,567
You're like a rock.

1357
01:56:38,677 --> 01:56:41,271
Yes. I'm buried deep right here.

1358
01:56:46,751 --> 01:56:48,912
My people have their freedom.

1359
01:56:49,020 --> 01:56:52,251
They've got a vote.
They've got power now.

1360
01:56:52,357 --> 01:56:54,291
And I've got to show them
how to use it.

1361
01:56:55,493 --> 01:56:57,393
When I'm through here
in Santa Marta...

1362
01:56:57,495 --> 01:57:03,229
I'll go to St. Kitts and Barbados and Grenada-
the whole archipelago.

1363
01:57:03,335 --> 01:57:05,269
Shall I tell you why
you won't go to England?

1364
01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:08,635
You don't want that power for your people.
You want it for yourself.

1365
01:57:08,740 --> 01:57:12,471
You're afraid to go there
because you won't have it anymore.

1366
01:57:12,577 --> 01:57:14,875
- Do you really mean that?
- I wanted to admire you...

1367
01:57:14,980 --> 01:57:17,346
to feel that you were
superior to most men.

1368
01:57:17,449 --> 01:57:20,475
People don't count with you.
Nothing counts with you but power.

1369
01:57:20,585 --> 01:57:22,644
You use people.
You climb on their backs.

1370
01:57:24,055 --> 01:57:26,683
You can't mean that.

1371
01:57:26,791 --> 01:57:28,691
No, I don't.

1372
01:57:28,793 --> 01:57:31,728
You're right and I'm wrong.
I'm wrong and you're right.

1373
01:57:34,833 --> 01:57:38,667
- And that's the end, is it?
- Yes. That's the end.
