1
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:20,010
And so today
you are full-fledged ensigns.

2
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,306
Three short months ago you
assembled here from all walks of life:

3
00:02:24,306 --> 00:02:27,518
field, factory, office
and college campus.

4
00:02:27,518 --> 00:02:31,813
You knew what the fighting was about,
or you wouldn't have volunteered.

5
00:02:31,813 --> 00:02:34,942
Each of you knew
that the American way of life...

6
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:37,236
must be defended by life itself.

7
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:39,738
From here on...

8
00:02:39,738 --> 00:02:44,493
your education must continue in
the more demanding school of actual war.

9
00:02:45,118 --> 00:02:47,955
Wearing the gold stripe of ensign
in the United States Navy...

10
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:50,582
you go down to the sea to fight...

11
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:53,460
in the toughest conflict of all time.

12
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:56,588
Your fellow Americans
share my confidence...

13
00:02:56,588 --> 00:02:58,799
that you'll serve the navy
and the country...

14
00:02:58,924 --> 00:03:00,676
with honor and distinction.

15
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:03,929
Good luck, and good hunting.

16
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:12,980
Willie! Over here!

17
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:19,111
-Darling, I'm so proud of you!
-Thanks, Mother.

18
00:03:19,236 --> 00:03:21,113
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, Uncle Lloyd.

19
00:03:21,113 --> 00:03:24,658
Your mother will tell me if the navy
doesn't make use of your abilities.

20
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:29,037
With the proper approach, I could
help you be placed somewhere else.

21
00:03:32,374 --> 00:03:34,543
-Good luck in the meantime.
-Thank you.

22
00:03:34,543 --> 00:03:37,170
I'm afraid I'll have
to skip your party tonight.

23
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,256
Some of the fellows
are having a celebration--

24
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:41,216
But the party's in your honor.

25
00:03:41,341 --> 00:03:43,427
-Besides, we have so few days left--
-But Mother.

26
00:03:43,427 --> 00:03:47,389
Your friends will forgive you.
You can call them from the house.

27
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:53,145
I'll see you at 10:00.

28
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:09,703
Your eyes of blue,

29
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:12,623
Your kisses too,

30
00:04:12,623 --> 00:04:14,499
I never knew...

31
00:04:14,583 --> 00:04:18,170
what they could do,

32
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:23,675
I can't believe
that you're in love with me.

33
00:04:26,386 --> 00:04:31,391
You're telling everyone I know,

34
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:36,271
I'm on your mind
each place you go,

35
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:42,945
They can't believe
that you're in love with me.

36
00:04:46,198 --> 00:04:50,077
I have always placed you...

37
00:04:50,077 --> 00:04:53,914
far above me,

38
00:04:55,999 --> 00:05:00,712
I just can't imagine...

39
00:05:00,712 --> 00:05:04,466
that you love me,

40
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:10,305
And after all is said and done,

41
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:15,811
To think that I'm the lucky one,

42
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:21,567
I can't believe that you're in love...

43
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:26,864
with me.

44
00:05:35,956 --> 00:05:37,499
May!

45
00:05:40,502 --> 00:05:42,087
You were wonderful.

46
00:05:42,087 --> 00:05:44,381
Thanks. I'm surprised your mother
let you out.

47
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:48,969
I had to be with her. I should have
told you yesterday I couldn't make it.

48
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:52,306
-I'm sorry.
-Order me a drink, and then we'll fight.

49
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:55,517
Leo, two Scotch and waters, please.

50
00:05:56,894 --> 00:05:59,688
Let's not spoil the night.
I've only a couple days left.

51
00:06:02,107 --> 00:06:04,693
I'm leaving Sunday.

52
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:06,778
How do you expect me to feel...

53
00:06:06,778 --> 00:06:10,365
leaving me standing there
all alone?

54
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:12,451
Why didn't you introduce me
to your mother?

55
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:16,205
I wanted you to meet her,
but there's a time for everything.

56
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:18,165
I'm sure.

57
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,461
Thank you.

58
00:06:24,296 --> 00:06:27,633
To the most important woman
in your life: Mom.

59
00:06:27,758 --> 00:06:29,134
Stop it!

60
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:35,390
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to ruin your big evening.

61
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,351
Guess I just bruise easily.

62
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,853
How should we celebrate?

63
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:44,983
We can go to the Fairmont,
Top Of The Mark--anything you say.

64
00:06:45,817 --> 00:06:47,486
Or we don't have to go to a club.

65
00:06:48,904 --> 00:06:52,658
-Meaning what?
-I've only got 48 hours.

66
00:06:53,742 --> 00:06:55,494
Willie, don't.

67
00:06:56,745 --> 00:06:58,205
I love you.

68
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,835
All right. Will you marry me?

69
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:08,507
-If there were more time--
-Don't look so embarrassed.

70
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:11,969
I didn't expect you to.

71
00:07:11,969 --> 00:07:13,762
I guess I forgot how I was.

72
00:07:13,762 --> 00:07:15,722
-I didn't mean it like that.
-Just another nightclub singer...

73
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:17,683
for a big weekend.

74
00:07:17,808 --> 00:07:20,018
Well, I don't want anymore of it.

75
00:07:20,018 --> 00:07:22,187
-Not another minute!
-May!

76
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:51,466
Good luck, Mr. Keith.

77
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:53,135
Thanks, George.

78
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:57,222
Good-bye, Mother.

79
00:07:58,265 --> 00:08:00,976
-Cable when you get to Pearl Harbor.
-If I can.

80
00:08:00,976 --> 00:08:04,938
I'm worried. That ship you're assigned
to has been in lots of battles.

81
00:08:04,938 --> 00:08:07,149
-Don't worry.
-Do you have enough spending money?

82
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:11,320
-More than enough.
-Take this extra $100, dear.

83
00:08:12,863 --> 00:08:15,908
-Please don't cry.
-I can't help it.

84
00:08:15,908 --> 00:08:18,076
You're all I have left.

85
00:08:18,076 --> 00:08:20,078
Promise me to be careful.

86
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:22,331
Don't do anything foolish
or dangerous.

87
00:08:22,331 --> 00:08:23,582
I won't.

88
00:08:23,707 --> 00:08:25,375
I promise.

89
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:29,338
Good-bye, sweetheart.

90
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:45,163
-Request permission to come on board.
-Permission granted.

91
00:09:49,626 --> 00:09:52,754
-Sir, the Caine's a real beauty.
-The Caine is the inboard ship.

92
00:09:52,754 --> 00:09:55,048
Crossing over.
This way, Keith.

93
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,277
This way, Keith.

94
00:10:27,456 --> 00:10:30,626
Watch that enthusiasm. Nobody's left
that way about the Caine before.

95
00:10:30,626 --> 00:10:34,880
-I'm sorry, sir. I lost my footing.
-This is Lieutenant Keefer.

96
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,508
-How about logging him in, Tom?
-Your orders.

97
00:10:37,508 --> 00:10:41,845
Those monstrous papers that transform
ex-civilians into men without minds.

98
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:46,141
-I hate to do this to you--
-Gangway! Lady with a baby.

99
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,315
Meatball, Horrible! Pick up
Mr. Keith's gear in the whaleboat.

100
00:10:53,315 --> 00:10:54,274
Aye, sir.

101
00:10:58,362 --> 00:11:01,240
This is our executive officer,
Steve Maryk.

102
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,033
-Glad to have you.
-Thank you, sir.

103
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:06,161
Steve's the guy that gets things done.
There's one on every ship.

104
00:11:06,161 --> 00:11:09,289
Very funny.
Come on, Keith. Let's meet the captain.

105
00:11:22,427 --> 00:11:25,013
-Watch your feet, sir!
-Come on, Keith.

106
00:11:26,515 --> 00:11:28,767
They're making a mistake
scraping this ship.

107
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:32,437
The only thing that's keeping
the water out is the rust.

108
00:11:40,028 --> 00:11:41,280
What do you want?

109
00:11:42,531 --> 00:11:45,701
-He's here, sir.
-Okay. Bring him in.

110
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,495
In here.

111
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,254
Captain DeVriess, this is Ensign Keith.

112
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:08,932
May I see your orders
and qualifications jacket...

113
00:12:08,932 --> 00:12:11,018
or are they a military secret?

114
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:12,561
I'm sorry.

115
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:21,236
"Princeton, '41."'

116
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:26,450
"Top five percent
in midshipman's school."

117
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:31,663
Pretty good background.
Pretty good record.

118
00:12:33,123 --> 00:12:36,043
Disappointed they assigned you
to a minesweeper?

119
00:12:37,502 --> 00:12:39,671
Well, sir, to be honest--yes, sir.

120
00:12:39,671 --> 00:12:44,259
You saw yourself on a carrier
or battleship, no doubt?

121
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:45,844
Yes. I had hoped--

122
00:12:45,928 --> 00:12:49,389
Well, I only hope
that you're good enough for the Caine.

123
00:12:50,516 --> 00:12:52,601
I'll try to be worthy
of this assignment.

124
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:57,523
She's not a battleship or carrier.
She's a beaten-up tub.

125
00:12:57,523 --> 00:13:02,945
After 18 months of combat, it takes 24
hours a day to keep her in once piece.

126
00:13:02,945 --> 00:13:06,073
-I understand.
-I don't think you do.

127
00:13:06,782 --> 00:13:10,953
But whether you like it or not,
you're in the junkyard navy.

128
00:13:12,621 --> 00:13:17,334
Steve, put him with Keefer
in communications, and tell Tom...

129
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:22,881
to show this Princeton tiger and our
other new ensign around the ship.

130
00:13:22,881 --> 00:13:24,842
Yes, sir.

131
00:13:24,842 --> 00:13:27,135
And Keith...

132
00:13:27,135 --> 00:13:29,555
don't take it so hard.

133
00:13:29,555 --> 00:13:31,390
War is hell.

134
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:40,482
-Ensign Keith, Ensign Harding.
-My condolences.

135
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:44,152
-Thanks.
-All right. Let's get with it.

136
00:13:44,152 --> 00:13:48,407
The U.S.S. Caine is a minesweeper. These
are paravanes used for mine sweeping.

137
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:50,909
They carry sweep wires
out both sides of the ship.

138
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:54,246
The wire contacts a mooring cable
of a mine and saws it in two.

139
00:13:54,246 --> 00:13:58,917
We've been in combat a year and a half
and never been asked to sweep a mine.

140
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:00,711
The first thing to learn
about this ship...

141
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:04,882
is that she was designed by geniuses
to be run by idiots.

142
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:12,931
This is the engine room. To operate,
all you need are well-trained monkeys.

143
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:16,268
Ninety-nine percent of everything we do
is strict routine.

144
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:19,479
Only one percent
requires creative intelligence.

145
00:14:20,522 --> 00:14:22,399
Well, that about does it.

146
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,359
-Any more questions?
-Yes, sir.

147
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:28,030
-Where do we go to surrender?
-It's not that easy.

148
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:30,949
-You don't like the navy?
-Who called the Caine the navy?

149
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:33,952
Gentlemen, just one more thing to do:
Climb the mast.

150
00:14:41,877 --> 00:14:44,379
What for? A mast is a mast.

151
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:48,050
When the captain orders the tour,
he means from the keel to the foretop.

152
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,052
That's the foretop.

153
00:14:52,012 --> 00:14:55,140
I have a wife and a kid.
I'm very fond of them.

154
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,226
I'll probably never see them again.

155
00:15:28,841 --> 00:15:30,259
Well done!

156
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:33,846
I'm glad he liked it.

157
00:15:33,846 --> 00:15:38,934
Yeah. Keith? I regret to tell you
I'm gonna be sick.

158
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:41,937
I'm sorry. Height bothers me.

159
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:45,399
Those poor sailors down there!

160
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,527
I could use my hat,
but it's the only one I've got.

161
00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:51,864
I have two others.

162
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:54,992
-That's darn cordial of you.
-Perfectly welcome.

163
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:06,044
Hey! What's keeping you guys up there?
Lunch!

164
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:14,720
Excuse me, sir.

165
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,097
It's all right.

166
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,644
Tell me. Now that you've had a chance
to study the Caine more closely...

167
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:24,313
do you like her any better?

168
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:27,941
The tour was very interesting.

169
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:30,569
The ship too messy for you?

170
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:34,323
-That's a difficult question.
-It's a ridiculous question.

171
00:16:34,323 --> 00:16:36,408
The question is, is this mess a ship?

172
00:16:37,951 --> 00:16:40,579
Very decent of you
to join us for lunch, Tom.

173
00:16:40,579 --> 00:16:42,831
I didn't think you could spare the time.

174
00:16:42,956 --> 00:16:47,336
My novel will suffer, but even great
literary artists get hungry.

175
00:16:47,336 --> 00:16:50,672
Pull up a chair, and cast some pearls
before the swine.

176
00:16:50,672 --> 00:16:53,675
-Or whatever it is you say you do.
-I will.

177
00:16:53,675 --> 00:16:58,263
Somebody has to protect these fresh
faces from the captain's badgering.

178
00:16:58,263 --> 00:17:00,057
I'm not badgering anyone.

179
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:04,102
I'm just conducting a one-man board
of inquiry. I'm trying to find out...

180
00:17:04,102 --> 00:17:07,564
if Ensign Keith wants to stay on board.

181
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,776
There is no escape, save death.

182
00:17:10,776 --> 00:17:14,112
We are all doing penance.
Sentenced to an outcast ship...

183
00:17:14,112 --> 00:17:17,991
manned by outcasts and named after
the greatest outcast of them all.

184
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:19,785
Here we go again.

185
00:17:19,868 --> 00:17:22,454
-I'm merely stating fact.
-He's right.

186
00:17:22,454 --> 00:17:25,207
I've been sweating it out myself
for over two years...

187
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:29,461
waiting to be relieved of command,
and there's no sign of it yet.

188
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:35,384
But then I don't have
Ensign Keith's influence.

189
00:17:35,384 --> 00:17:37,302
Sir, I don't understand.

190
00:17:39,263 --> 00:17:45,227
I received this dispatch
from Admiral Walsh about an hour ago.

191
00:17:45,227 --> 00:17:49,064
"With your approval, will request
transfer to my staff...

192
00:17:49,064 --> 00:17:51,149
for Ensign Willis Seward Keith.

193
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:56,655
Understand needs of U.S.S. Caine
have priority.

194
00:17:57,739 --> 00:17:59,491
I didn't know anything about this.

195
00:18:00,409 --> 00:18:02,911
Could be coincidence.

196
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:06,665
Or someone pulling strings.

197
00:18:06,665 --> 00:18:10,836
What'll it be? The Admiral's staff
or, as Tom puts it...

198
00:18:10,836 --> 00:18:13,589
the hell of the Caine?

199
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,258
I don't know.

200
00:18:16,383 --> 00:18:19,511
It's a simple choice.
Do you want to fight a war?

201
00:18:19,511 --> 00:18:21,597
This is hardly the place
for a decision.

202
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,767
Nonsense. A good officer
can make up his mind anywhere.

203
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:30,856
Come on. We haven't got all day.

204
00:18:30,856 --> 00:18:32,733
Well, sir.

205
00:18:47,998 --> 00:18:49,625
I'll stay on board.

206
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,960
That takes care of that.

207
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,172
Ah, Willie. You will live
to regret this day.

208
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:16,735
Sir, I spotted Japanese aircraft.
Broad on the starboard bow.

209
00:19:16,735 --> 00:19:18,820
Position angle 20.

210
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:21,740
Do you see them, Captain?

211
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:25,410
ff the war lasts 10 years,
you may learn the difference...

212
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:28,247
between aircraft and sea gulls.

213
00:19:40,008 --> 00:19:42,302
Man all stations
for mine sweeping drill.

214
00:19:45,097 --> 00:19:47,099
Launch sweep gear.

215
00:19:57,442 --> 00:19:59,111
Put paravanes in the water.

216
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:10,038
Steve, that was the lousiest performance
I've ever seen!

217
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:14,418
-Tell the men to get the lead out.
-Stand by to stream starboard side.

218
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:21,383
Retrieve sweep gear.

219
00:20:38,734 --> 00:20:41,236
Snap it up! The Jones is beating us in.

220
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:45,073
-Look out!
-Stop the engines.

221
00:20:45,073 --> 00:20:48,744
-Get me a line.
-Don't swim. The water's full of sharks!

222
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:52,915
-Stand by the line.
-Yes, sir.

223
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,177
This action dispatch just arrived.

224
00:21:05,177 --> 00:21:07,179
Mr. Keefer says you've got
the code duty.

225
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:09,139
I'tl take care of it right away.

226
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,279
Okay! Haul away!

227
00:21:38,335 --> 00:21:41,713
Lead the line outboard of everything.

228
00:22:03,485 --> 00:22:05,904
Report float recovered.

229
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,160
The Jones never saw the day
it could beat us.

230
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:17,583
You pooped out! We streamed
three minutes quicker at Guadalcanal!

231
00:22:19,418 --> 00:22:22,045
You must love that guy
to do what you did for him.

232
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:24,006
Go dry yourself.

233
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:38,312
-That you, Willie?
-Yeah.

234
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:44,151
-Didn't you say you went to Princeton?
-I didn't say.

235
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:47,613
One day I may let you read
a couple chapters of my novel.

236
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:49,573
A Princeton man's opinion
might he valuable.

237
00:22:49,573 --> 00:22:51,116
Thanks.

238
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,140
-Horrible!
-Yes, sir?

239
00:23:15,224 --> 00:23:17,935
Pick up those orange peels.
This isn't a honey barge.

240
00:23:17,935 --> 00:23:19,478
Yes, sir.

241
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:23,899
All right, Meatball.
Laugh once more, and you're in trouble.

242
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:38,997
Ensign Keith,
report to the captain's cabin.

243
00:23:38,997 --> 00:23:41,708
On the double

244
00:23:42,751 --> 00:23:48,090
All these 90-day wonders. Every one of
'em thinks he's a five-star admiral!

245
00:23:55,472 --> 00:23:57,432
-Come in.
-Yes, sir?

246
00:23:57,432 --> 00:24:02,354
Three days ago this ship received
a dispatch addressed to us for action.

247
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,527
Smitty says he gave it to you.
is that correct?

248
00:24:08,527 --> 00:24:11,864
I forgot about it. It's still
in the pocket of my dirty khakis.

249
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:14,366
Did you decode the message?

250
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:17,578
No, sir. It's incredible stupidity
and carelessness on my part--

251
00:24:17,578 --> 00:24:20,622
Fortunately, I had the job
done for you.

252
00:24:20,622 --> 00:24:23,292
-That'll be all, Smitty.
-Yes, sir.

253
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:34,136
Have you any idea how serious
misplacing an action dispatch can be?

254
00:24:34,136 --> 00:24:36,638
-Yes, sir.
-I don't think you have.

255
00:24:36,638 --> 00:24:41,643
Because of you, this ship might have
failed to carry out a combat assignment.

256
00:24:42,477 --> 00:24:44,688
I hope you realize
that for such a failure...

257
00:24:44,813 --> 00:24:47,816
I'd bear the full responsibility
in a court-martial.

258
00:24:47,816 --> 00:24:49,902
I understand, sir.

259
00:24:51,778 --> 00:24:55,407
I've been filling out officers'
fitness reports this morning.

260
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:59,077
How do you think this ought
to affect yours?

261
00:24:59,077 --> 00:25:03,582
-Anyone can make a mistake.
-There are mistakes and mistakes.

262
00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:06,502
The margin for error is narrow
in the navy.

263
00:25:06,502 --> 00:25:11,173
There's too much loss of life
and property possible in every act.

264
00:25:11,173 --> 00:25:12,841
Here.

265
00:25:13,884 --> 00:25:15,844
Read it.

266
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:22,643
"Ensign Keith seems a fairly
bright young man.

267
00:25:22,643 --> 00:25:24,728
He may become a competent officer...

268
00:25:24,728 --> 00:25:30,150
once he overcomes a light and careless
approach to his duties."

269
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,278
Do you consider it unfair?

270
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:35,989
-If I may be permitted?
-Go ahead.

271
00:25:35,989 --> 00:25:39,535
I made a mistake, but I don't see
why I should be singled out for it.

272
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:42,120
Every one's goofed off around here.

273
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,748
The Caine's a slake ship.
The men act like cutthroats...

274
00:25:44,748 --> 00:25:46,625
and the decks look like
a Singapore junk.

275
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:51,630
t take it you must also strongly
disapprove of me.

276
00:25:53,298 --> 00:25:55,300
Go ahead. Man-to-man.

277
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,303
I'm in no position to approve
or disapprove.

278
00:25:58,303 --> 00:26:02,057
I only know that my conception
of a captain seems different than yours.

279
00:26:02,057 --> 00:26:04,560
I'll take it under advisement.

280
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,854
Since you feel so bitter...

281
00:26:06,854 --> 00:26:10,732
perhaps what's in the dispatch
will brighten your day.

282
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:17,281
As you can see,
I'm being relieved of command.

283
00:26:17,281 --> 00:26:20,826
Next week this time,
you'll have yourself a new captain.

284
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:25,622
Lieutenant Commander
Philip Francis Queeg.

285
00:26:26,748 --> 00:26:29,168
-Feel better?
-Definitely, sir.

286
00:26:29,168 --> 00:26:30,752
Good.

287
00:26:30,752 --> 00:26:32,713
That'll be afI.

288
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,974
"In accordance
with Bureau of Naval Personnel...

289
00:26:43,974 --> 00:26:48,353
order 0-1-6-0-2-1 of November, 1943...

290
00:26:48,353 --> 00:26:54,109
you'll report to the Commanding Officer
U.S.S. Caine as his relief in command.

291
00:26:54,109 --> 00:26:59,531
Signed, Lewis Whitfield,
Rear Admiral, U.S.N., Chief of Bureau."

292
00:27:00,949 --> 00:27:02,868
I relieve you, sir.

293
00:27:02,868 --> 00:27:07,122
All standing orders to remain in force
until further notice.

294
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,667
Dismiss the men from quarters.

295
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:13,170
-Good luck, Captain.
-Thank you.

296
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:22,971
Crew dismissed.

297
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:32,898
Oh, Captain.

298
00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:37,069
I can stay aboard for a couple of days
till you get used to things.

299
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:40,822
There's no need for that. We all have
our own ways of running a ship.

300
00:27:40,822 --> 00:27:44,993
Sure. This one's tired.
She's had the guts run out of her.

301
00:27:45,077 --> 00:27:48,080
Ought to be melted down
for razor blades.

302
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,667
The crew may not look like much.
They're tired too.

303
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,919
But every man is okay.

304
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,964
-I understand.
-I hope you do.

305
00:27:56,964 --> 00:27:58,757
Yours, Captain.

306
00:28:02,803 --> 00:28:05,597
Attention on deck.

307
00:28:05,597 --> 00:28:08,225
-Request permission to leave the ship.
-Permission granted.

308
00:28:08,225 --> 00:28:10,853
-Captain, sir?
-What is it, Meatball?

309
00:28:10,853 --> 00:28:12,271
Nothing.

310
00:28:14,189 --> 00:28:17,401
A few of the guys chipped in and--

311
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:23,448
Whose idea was this?

312
00:28:25,033 --> 00:28:28,036
I won't accept it.
It's against navy regulations.

313
00:28:28,036 --> 00:28:31,373
-I told them--
-You don't always go by regulations.

314
00:28:31,373 --> 00:28:36,378
That's my trouble.
I've been aboard the Caine too long.

315
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,632
You men take an even strain
with the new skipper..

316
00:28:40,632 --> 00:28:42,634
and everything will he all right.

317
00:28:43,886 --> 00:28:46,471
-I'm leaving the ship, sir.
-Yes, sir.

318
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:01,486
Well, what do you know.

319
00:29:01,612 --> 00:29:03,822
Somebody left this watch
lying around.

320
00:29:06,074 --> 00:29:09,828
Might as well have a souvenir
of this old bucket.

321
00:29:10,787 --> 00:29:13,290
Not a bad-looking watch at that.

322
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,167
What time is it, Mr. Keith?

323
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:18,504
-Eleven hundred, sir.
-Make it 10:30.

324
00:29:18,504 --> 00:29:21,632
I'll always keep it
a half hour slow.

325
00:29:21,632 --> 00:29:24,426
Remind me of the fouled-up crew
of the Caine.

326
00:29:46,949 --> 00:29:49,034
Carry on.

327
00:30:01,463 --> 00:30:04,800
What's everybody so choked up for?

328
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,511
No matter what anybody says,
I still think...

329
00:30:07,511 --> 00:30:10,013
that someday you'll make an officer.

330
00:30:10,013 --> 00:30:14,476
Captain Queeg requests a meeting
of all officers at 1300.

331
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:20,649
Gentlemen, we'll be shipmates
for a long time...

332
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:22,943
and I thought we ought
to get acquainted.

333
00:30:22,943 --> 00:30:27,114
I've formed some good impressions.
you're probably curious about me.

334
00:30:27,114 --> 00:30:31,410
My background is simple enough.
Just another naval officer.

335
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,912
I've had seven tough years
in the Atlantic.

336
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:37,666
Believe you me, they made
the last two mighty interesting.

337
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:43,505
The way those subs ganged up on us
I thought they had it in for me.

338
00:30:43,505 --> 00:30:45,340
Now to get down to cases.

339
00:30:45,465 --> 00:30:48,093
Any one who knows me
knows I'm a book man.

340
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:51,013
I believe everything was put in it
for a purpose.

341
00:30:51,013 --> 00:30:54,433
When in doubt,
remember we do things by the book.

342
00:30:54,433 --> 00:30:57,352
Deviate from the book,
and you'd better have good reasons...

343
00:30:57,352 --> 00:31:00,189
and you'll still get
an argument from me.

344
00:31:00,189 --> 00:31:03,817
And f don't lose arguments
on board my ship.

345
00:31:03,817 --> 00:31:06,445
That's one of the nice things
about being captain.

346
00:31:07,863 --> 00:31:10,365
I want you to remember one thing.

347
00:31:10,365 --> 00:31:12,784
On my ship,
excellent performance is standard.

348
00:31:12,784 --> 00:31:15,078
Standard performance is substandard.

349
00:31:15,078 --> 00:31:18,707
Substandard performance is not permitted
to exist. That, I warn you.

350
00:31:22,377 --> 00:31:26,215
Now that I've shot my face off,
any one can now do the same thing.

351
00:31:28,217 --> 00:31:30,093
I don't wanna seem out of line...

352
00:31:30,093 --> 00:31:33,722
but it's been a long time
since this crew did things by the book.

353
00:31:33,722 --> 00:31:39,478
Mr. Maryk, tell the crew there are four
ways of doing things on board my ship.

354
00:31:39,478 --> 00:31:42,898
The right way, the wrong way,
the navy way and my way.

355
00:31:43,023 --> 00:31:44,691
They do things my way,
we'll get along.

356
00:31:44,691 --> 00:31:46,235
Aye, aye, sir.

357
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,490
Anyone else?

358
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:53,867
Come in.

359
00:31:53,992 --> 00:31:55,827
Sorry to interrupt.

360
00:31:55,827 --> 00:31:58,580
Official message from ComServPao.

361
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,332
Thank you.

362
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,797
One moment, messenger.

363
00:32:10,551 --> 00:32:13,887
-What's your name and rate?
-Urban, sir. Seaman First.

364
00:32:13,887 --> 00:32:16,265
Signalman Striker.

365
00:32:16,265 --> 00:32:19,184
Very well. You may go.

366
00:32:19,184 --> 00:32:21,186
Yes, sir.

367
00:32:39,955 --> 00:32:41,832
Gentlemen...

368
00:32:41,832 --> 00:32:45,294
anyone notice anything peculiar
about Seaman First Class Urban?

369
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,050
A shirttail hanging out of trousers
is the uniform for busboys...

370
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:54,761
not for a sailor
in the United States Navy.

371
00:32:54,761 --> 00:32:58,724
These are the things
we are going to start noticing again.

372
00:32:58,724 --> 00:33:00,392
Who's the morale officer?

373
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:03,103
There is no morale officer, sir.

374
00:33:03,103 --> 00:33:05,898
-Who's the junior ensign?
-Keith, sir.

375
00:33:08,108 --> 00:33:11,236
-Sir?
-You are now the morale officer.

376
00:33:11,236 --> 00:33:14,656
In addition to y our duties, see that
every man keeps his shirttail...

377
00:33:14,656 --> 00:33:16,325
tucked inside his trousers.

378
00:33:16,325 --> 00:33:17,576
Aye, aye, sir.

379
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:25,918
If I see another shirttail flapping
white I'm captain of this ship...

380
00:33:25,918 --> 00:33:28,545
woe betide the sailor,
woe betide the O.O.D...

381
00:33:28,545 --> 00:33:31,882
and woe betide the morale officer--
I kid you not.

382
00:33:33,425 --> 00:33:37,596
According to this,
we're to proceed to Area X-ray...

383
00:33:37,596 --> 00:33:40,349
at 0800 tomorrow to tow targets.

384
00:33:40,349 --> 00:33:44,269
I'll put it to you simply: The Caine
will be the best target-towing ship...

385
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:46,063
in this man's navy.

386
00:33:46,897 --> 00:33:49,942
That'tl be all, gentlemen.

387
00:33:52,736 --> 00:33:55,030
All men are to have their hair out
to regulation length...

388
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:57,533
and their faces clean-shaven
by 2400.

389
00:33:57,616 --> 00:33:59,618
Aye, aye, sir.

390
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:07,209
Welf, he's certainly navy.

391
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,213
Yeah. So was Captain Bligh.

392
00:34:23,058 --> 00:34:26,103
Attention all hands!

393
00:34:26,103 --> 00:34:29,314
Ships will commence firing
at target at 1000.

394
00:34:29,314 --> 00:34:32,067
All observers lay oft to the fantail.

395
00:34:39,575 --> 00:34:41,743
Flash.

396
00:34:41,743 --> 00:34:44,329
Short. 200. Over.

397
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:46,665
One hundred. Two-fifty.

398
00:34:49,042 --> 00:34:50,711
Hit. Over.

399
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:53,338
One hundred. Two-fifty.

400
00:34:55,424 --> 00:34:57,259
Short. One hundred.

401
00:34:57,259 --> 00:35:00,721
Over. 150, 200.

402
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:04,349
Ensign Keith report to the bridge
on the double.

403
00:35:21,575 --> 00:35:22,701
Yes, sir?

404
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:27,122
Have you any explanation
for the appearance of this sailor?

405
00:35:27,122 --> 00:35:30,042
-You heard my order on shirttails.
-I got a heat rash--

406
00:35:30,042 --> 00:35:33,128
-Tuck your shirt in now.
-The captain won't let me.

407
00:35:33,128 --> 00:35:36,048
I want you to see
what a rotten job you're doing.

408
00:35:36,048 --> 00:35:38,800
Gwendolyn, this is Tarzan.

409
00:35:40,469 --> 00:35:42,304
Tarzan, this is Gwendolyn.

410
00:35:42,304 --> 00:35:45,057
Cease present exercises
and return to base.

411
00:35:45,057 --> 00:35:48,060
-Well done. Out.
-Roger.

412
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,645
Thank you, sir.

413
00:35:50,562 --> 00:35:53,565
We're heading back.
Right standard rudder.

414
00:35:55,484 --> 00:35:57,444
And now, first of all...

415
00:35:57,444 --> 00:35:59,821
do you or don't you
have an explanation for this?

416
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:02,658
-I was on the--
-I didn't ask for an alibi.

417
00:36:02,658 --> 00:36:04,743
My orders mean very little to you.

418
00:36:04,743 --> 00:36:07,871
I'm completely at fault.
But I tried my best--

419
00:36:07,871 --> 00:36:11,416
Your best is only a maximum
of inefficiency.

420
00:36:15,087 --> 00:36:18,507
What's the matter with the old man?
We're steaming in a circle.

421
00:36:18,507 --> 00:36:20,509
Yeah, I know.

422
00:36:20,592 --> 00:36:23,178
-Captain.
-Don't interrupt while I'm speaking.

423
00:36:23,178 --> 00:36:26,932
-We're going--
-One more word and you're on report.

424
00:36:26,932 --> 00:36:31,770
Can you explain why this occurred while
you were officer of the deck?

425
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:34,356
There are limits
to what a man can do.

426
00:36:34,356 --> 00:36:38,861
The officer of the deck is equally
as responsible for his duties...

427
00:36:38,861 --> 00:36:41,029
as I am for the welfare of this ship.

428
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:43,031
And one thing more, mister.

429
00:36:43,115 --> 00:36:45,617
War is a 24-hour job.

430
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:50,122
There will be no more novel writing
on the Caine.

431
00:36:56,795 --> 00:36:58,630
You will both submit
written reports explaining...

432
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,884
A: why this man had
his shirttail out.

433
00:37:01,884 --> 00:37:04,803
B: why you failed so miserably
to carry out my orders.

434
00:37:04,803 --> 00:37:06,388
Aye, aye.

435
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:12,811
Hey, Meatball! Am I seeing straight...

436
00:37:12,811 --> 00:37:15,147
or are we cutting back
across our towline?

437
00:37:16,565 --> 00:37:19,735
That's impossible.
But it's happened!

438
00:37:23,071 --> 00:37:24,907
We're gonna out across
our own towline!

439
00:37:24,907 --> 00:37:28,702
-You better tell him again.
-Not me.

440
00:37:38,504 --> 00:37:41,590
What's happened?
What's going on?

441
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:48,096
What's our target doing out there?

442
00:37:49,848 --> 00:37:52,851
-What have you been doing?
-You said keep right standard rudder.

443
00:37:52,851 --> 00:37:55,270
You idiot! All engines stop.

444
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:08,200
Captain, we've steamed over
our own towline!

445
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,453
-Who said that?
-We've cut the target adrift.

446
00:38:11,453 --> 00:38:14,665
We did nothing of the kind.
Something is wrong with the cable.

447
00:38:15,374 --> 00:38:20,587
We can't be responsible if we're given
faulty cables that break.

448
00:38:20,587 --> 00:38:23,298
Should we recover the target? It
shouldn't take more than half an hour.

449
00:38:23,298 --> 00:38:27,803
Half an hour? That means we'll be
the last ship back in Pearl Harbor.

450
00:38:27,803 --> 00:38:31,473
No, thank you. We're not gonna
answer questions about something...

451
00:38:31,473 --> 00:38:33,433
that's not our fault.

452
00:38:33,433 --> 00:38:36,144
-Reel in the cable.
-Aye, aye, sir.

453
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:45,946
Send the following dispatch
to ComServPac.

454
00:38:48,574 --> 00:38:52,411
Defective towline parted
southwest corner X-ray.

455
00:38:53,245 --> 00:38:55,414
Target adrift.

456
00:38:55,414 --> 00:38:57,749
Menace to navigation.

457
00:38:57,749 --> 00:39:01,920
Suggest tug recover or destroy.

458
00:39:05,674 --> 00:39:07,509
He'll never get away with it.

459
00:39:08,802 --> 00:39:11,513
-Let's head for the barn.
-Aye, aye, sir.

460
00:39:11,513 --> 00:39:13,765
All engines ahead full.

461
00:39:28,614 --> 00:39:30,991
-Sir?
-You look worried.

462
00:39:30,991 --> 00:39:34,536
I know a man's shirt's
a petty detail...

463
00:39:34,536 --> 00:39:36,830
but big things
are made up of details.

464
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:39,541
"For want of a nail
a horseshoe was lost"...

465
00:39:39,541 --> 00:39:41,627
and then the whole battle.

466
00:39:43,921 --> 00:39:46,632
A captain's job is a lonely one.

467
00:39:46,632 --> 00:39:49,218
He's easily misunderstood.

468
00:39:49,218 --> 00:39:51,720
Forget that I bawled you out.

469
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,431
It was the good of the morale
of all concerned.

470
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:57,392
Yes, sir.

471
00:40:08,403 --> 00:40:10,822
Hallelujah! Look what just came in.

472
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:14,159
-We're going back to San Francisco.
-You're kidding?

473
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:16,870
All thanks
to our beloved Captain Queeg.

474
00:40:16,995 --> 00:40:18,747
He's in plenty of hot water.

475
00:40:18,747 --> 00:40:21,333
I told you they'd never accept
his double-talk about the towline.

476
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:23,877
They can't send us all the way back
for that.

477
00:40:23,877 --> 00:40:28,423
Listen: "Upon arrival,
commanding officer report immediately...

478
00:40:28,423 --> 00:40:30,926
oommander western sea frontier."

479
00:40:30,926 --> 00:40:32,928
t tell you, he's in serious trouble.

480
00:40:33,011 --> 00:40:36,682
Our captain is about
to be boiled in oil.

481
00:40:36,682 --> 00:40:39,184
And you are about to see your girl.

482
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:44,458
-Willie, darling!
-Mother.

483
00:41:47,794 --> 00:41:50,923
-This is a real surprise.
-You didn't expeot me not to be here.

484
00:41:50,923 --> 00:41:53,842
It's wonderful to have my boy
close again.

485
00:41:57,387 --> 00:41:58,764
Mother...

486
00:41:59,681 --> 00:42:02,267
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

487
00:42:02,267 --> 00:42:05,187
May Wynn.

488
00:42:05,187 --> 00:42:09,191
I'm always delighted
to meet one of Wiflie's friends.

489
00:42:09,191 --> 00:42:11,151
Thank you.

490
00:42:14,488 --> 00:42:16,365
Hello? Hello, May.

491
00:42:17,616 --> 00:42:19,701
Sure. I'll he right down then.

492
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:27,125
-I guess I'm ready to go.
-I'm afraid I'll miss you a lot.

493
00:42:27,125 --> 00:42:29,086
tt's just a weekend at Yosemite.

494
00:42:29,086 --> 00:42:30,838
This sailor needs some playtime.

495
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:33,257
Miss Wynn is going with you?

496
00:42:33,257 --> 00:42:35,259
Yes, she is.

497
00:42:35,342 --> 00:42:37,553
You must feel very strongly about her.

498
00:42:37,553 --> 00:42:40,556
I do. I like her a tot.

499
00:42:40,556 --> 00:42:43,892
Now, you have a nice weekend yourself.

500
00:42:43,976 --> 00:42:48,689
-Are you in love with her?
-I don't know.

501
00:42:48,689 --> 00:42:51,316
But I sure missed her
while I was away.

502
00:42:51,316 --> 00:42:53,694
Well, she is attractive.

503
00:42:53,694 --> 00:42:55,654
But you don't know anything ahout her.

504
00:42:55,654 --> 00:42:58,490
-You haven't met her parents.
-That's right.

505
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:01,076
I guess I'll have to do that someday.

506
00:43:01,076 --> 00:43:05,247
For your own sake,
all I want you to do is--

507
00:43:05,247 --> 00:43:07,875
-Promise you won't do anything rash.
-I promise.

508
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:11,003
-You mean it?
-Sure I mean it.

509
00:43:11,837 --> 00:43:13,922
Good-bye, Mom.

510
00:43:34,359 --> 00:43:36,862
-Whoa!
-Pull him up easy.

511
00:43:36,862 --> 00:43:38,864
That's good.

512
00:43:46,538 --> 00:43:49,791
-How did you like it?
-Like breaking in a new song--

513
00:43:49,791 --> 00:43:51,543
It's fun, but it scares me.

514
00:43:52,628 --> 00:43:56,048
It was nice of your mother
to let you go to Yosemite.

515
00:43:56,048 --> 00:43:59,301
-It wasn't up to my mother.
-Well!

516
00:43:59,301 --> 00:44:01,470
Six months of war
has made a difference.

517
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:03,639
Has it?

518
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:06,683
I missed you more than f planned to.

519
00:44:11,188 --> 00:44:14,900
Let the fire fall!

520
00:44:22,241 --> 00:44:25,244
-This is paradise.
-Isn't it?

521
00:44:29,832 --> 00:44:32,417
Willie, there are people.

522
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:35,337
Let them look.

523
00:44:35,337 --> 00:44:37,548
You have changed.

524
00:44:37,548 --> 00:44:40,884
Sometimes I think
there's almost a chance for us.

525
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:46,932
It's getting late.

526
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,894
It's getting very late.

527
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:20,924
I'll wait. Thanks.

528
00:45:21,842 --> 00:45:23,927
Good morning. Sorry I'm late.

529
00:45:24,887 --> 00:45:27,806
Guess I'm not used
to being without an alarm clock.

530
00:45:27,806 --> 00:45:30,934
Oh, what a day! Have you ordered yet?

531
00:45:30,934 --> 00:45:33,729
-Not yet.
-Just orange juice and coffee, please.

532
00:45:33,729 --> 00:45:35,230
Make it two.

533
00:45:35,314 --> 00:45:37,608
You know what I'd love to do?

534
00:45:37,608 --> 00:45:42,404
I'd love to climb to the top
of that mountain over there.

535
00:45:43,572 --> 00:45:45,824
Darfing, what's the matter?

536
00:45:47,743 --> 00:45:51,163
-Just thinking.
-Come on. Something's the matter.

537
00:45:51,163 --> 00:45:53,248
-I expected you to be happy.
-May.

538
00:45:53,248 --> 00:45:57,211
What would you think of spending
your life with a monster tike me?

539
00:45:58,587 --> 00:46:02,007
-What's this?
-I'm talking about getting married.

540
00:46:04,009 --> 00:46:07,930
-Is that what you really want?
-Of course I want it.

541
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:09,848
Don't look at me
as if I were crazy.

542
00:46:10,974 --> 00:46:15,020
I don't want you to marry me because
you think it's a doesn't thing to do--

543
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,396
Look--

544
00:46:16,522 --> 00:46:19,191
I love you, and I wanna marry you.

545
00:46:19,191 --> 00:46:20,442
Yes or no?

546
00:46:27,783 --> 00:46:31,119
-Why not?
-Because your mother won't approve.

547
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,705
-Of course she'll approve.
-She won't.

548
00:46:33,705 --> 00:46:36,291
But you'll marry me anyway.
And you'll be so unhappy that--

549
00:46:36,291 --> 00:46:38,627
I won't be unhappy.

550
00:46:38,627 --> 00:46:40,295
I love you.

551
00:46:40,379 --> 00:46:42,673
Maybe you do.

552
00:46:42,673 --> 00:46:44,758
Really do.

553
00:46:45,884 --> 00:46:48,804
But marriage'll have to be
hy our own approval.

554
00:46:48,804 --> 00:46:50,389
No one else's.

555
00:46:51,306 --> 00:46:53,392
That's asking a lot.

556
00:46:56,562 --> 00:46:58,313
That's right.

557
00:47:04,486 --> 00:47:08,323
Have a good cry, Willie.
I know I will!

558
00:47:21,879 --> 00:47:25,924
-In 30 seconds you"d have been A.W.O.L.
-I just got the telegram.

559
00:47:25,924 --> 00:47:28,760
And you couldn't tear your self away
from your girl?

560
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,346
Yeah. Any news on Queeg?

561
00:47:31,346 --> 00:47:34,808
Single up all lines,
and stand by to cast off!

562
00:47:34,933 --> 00:47:37,519
Hope you haven't been inconvenienced,
Mr. Keith.

563
00:47:38,854 --> 00:47:42,191
Seems like you made a slight mistake.
He's still here.

564
00:47:42,191 --> 00:47:45,527
My mistake was nothing
compared to the navy's.

565
00:47:45,652 --> 00:47:47,196
Take in the bow.

566
00:47:53,285 --> 00:47:56,497
Well, as you probably know by now...

567
00:47:56,497 --> 00:47:59,625
we returned to San Francisco
for a new radar installation.

568
00:47:59,625 --> 00:48:05,547
However, misleading reports
were sent to the force commander.

569
00:48:05,547 --> 00:48:09,635
This created doubts in his mind as to
the Caine's competence in combat.

570
00:48:09,635 --> 00:48:13,055
I made it clear I inherited
a ship in a low state of training...

571
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:16,099
and couldn't he expected
to pull it into shape overnight.

572
00:48:16,099 --> 00:48:17,643
He agreed.

573
00:48:18,894 --> 00:48:21,647
From now on, there will not he
any further mistakes...

574
00:48:21,647 --> 00:48:24,983
on the part of the officers
and orew of this ship.

575
00:48:24,983 --> 00:48:27,069
Some smoke went down
the wrong way.

576
00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:30,489
This is an important command.

577
00:48:30,489 --> 00:48:33,492
The navy's waiting for a butoh.
Well, I'm not going to make it.

578
00:48:33,492 --> 00:48:37,162
And I'm not gonna permit
anybody to make it for me.

579
00:48:37,162 --> 00:48:39,665
So much for old business.

580
00:48:40,707 --> 00:48:44,253
Gentlemen, I've good news for you.

581
00:48:44,253 --> 00:48:47,589
We're on our way to the greatest
invasion attempted in this war.

582
00:48:47,589 --> 00:48:50,509
I kid you not. The greatest.

583
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:53,011
Let's all straighten up
and fly right!

584
00:49:12,531 --> 00:49:15,325
All hands put on battle dress.

585
00:49:20,622 --> 00:49:23,876
All hands put on battle dress
and anti-flash cream.

586
00:49:32,217 --> 00:49:35,971
We don't have to shoot the Japs.
We can scare 'em to death.

587
00:50:21,433 --> 00:50:23,018
Cease fire!

588
00:50:24,686 --> 00:50:27,064
Close the boat group and take station.
Keith, take the conn.

589
00:50:27,064 --> 00:50:29,274
Aye, aye, sir.

590
00:50:44,873 --> 00:50:48,043
That's the group we take in.
Jacob Group Four.

591
00:50:48,043 --> 00:50:50,712
Come right to course 0-4-5.

592
00:50:50,712 --> 00:50:52,798
All engines ahead full.

593
00:50:59,471 --> 00:51:02,391
We're closing too fast.
We'll run those boats down.

594
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:04,309
-Where's the captain?
-On the wing.

595
00:51:04,393 --> 00:51:07,521
How did he let you
handle a ship at a time like this?

596
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:09,606
All engines stop.

597
00:51:13,235 --> 00:51:14,820
Boat ahoy!

598
00:51:17,948 --> 00:51:20,325
What's going on?
Who's yelling to whom?

599
00:51:20,325 --> 00:51:23,078
It looked like we were overshooting
these boys, so I stopped.

600
00:51:23,078 --> 00:51:24,913
What's the distance to the beach?

601
00:51:24,913 --> 00:51:29,084
-About three miles. We're supposed--
-I know. Within 1, 000 yards.

602
00:51:29,084 --> 00:51:32,754
You take the conn. Get us there.
Full speed ahead.

603
00:51:32,754 --> 00:51:36,300
We will proceed. Follow us.

604
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,843
Good luck.

605
00:51:37,968 --> 00:51:39,928
Okay. Thanks.

606
00:51:52,774 --> 00:51:55,611
Left tangent 0-0-6.

607
00:51:55,611 --> 00:51:57,988
Beaoon 0-8-4.

608
00:51:57,988 --> 00:52:00,073
Distance, 5, 000.

609
00:52:19,134 --> 00:52:23,013
We're too far ahead of the attack group.
Engines back one-third.

610
00:52:31,772 --> 00:52:34,274
Left tangent 3-5-0.

611
00:52:34,274 --> 00:52:36,902
Beaoon 1-1-6.

612
00:52:36,902 --> 00:52:38,862
Distance, 4, 000.

613
00:52:45,661 --> 00:52:48,247
-Why are we slowing down?
-We were losing them.

614
00:52:48,247 --> 00:52:51,083
If they can't keep up, throw over
a dye-marker when we reach the spot.

615
00:52:55,963 --> 00:52:59,174
We're getting too close!
You wanna run us on the beach?

616
00:52:59,174 --> 00:53:01,593
We still have at least
1, 500 yards to go.

617
00:53:01,593 --> 00:53:03,679
You're crazy!

618
00:53:05,138 --> 00:53:08,600
I can read instruments
as well as anybody on this ship!

619
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:12,646
We're within 1, 000 yards now!
This is as far as we must go!

620
00:53:12,646 --> 00:53:14,189
Left full rudder.

621
00:53:14,189 --> 00:53:16,608
Atl engines ahead full.

622
00:53:16,608 --> 00:53:19,945
Throw over a dye-marker.
You heard me!

623
00:53:19,945 --> 00:53:22,656
Fantail for bridge.
Throw over a dye-marker.

624
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:38,630
-We can't leave those marines!
-I'm taking the conn.

625
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:40,799
I relieve you.

626
00:53:40,799 --> 00:53:41,842
Aye, aye.

627
00:53:54,146 --> 00:53:57,065
-What's he doing? Running away?
-Don't look for trouble.

628
00:54:08,410 --> 00:54:11,580
Well, what do you think of your boy now?

629
00:54:13,248 --> 00:54:16,877
I don't know. There must be
a reason for what he did.

630
00:54:16,877 --> 00:54:19,087
Yeah. There's a reason, all right.

631
00:54:33,685 --> 00:54:36,897
I've got those yellowstain blues

632
00:54:36,897 --> 00:54:39,691
Those silly yellowstain blues

633
00:54:39,691 --> 00:54:42,110
When someone fires a shot

634
00:54:42,110 --> 00:54:45,364
It's always f here I am not

635
00:54:45,364 --> 00:54:49,201
I've got those yellowstain blues

636
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:52,037
The old yellowstain blues

637
00:54:52,037 --> 00:54:55,874
Those yellowstain blues

638
00:54:56,917 --> 00:55:00,379
-We better pipe down.
-Don't be so worried.

639
00:55:00,379 --> 00:55:03,882
It's time you got over being impressed
hy people with authority...

640
00:55:03,882 --> 00:55:05,384
like parents and ships' captains.

641
00:55:05,384 --> 00:55:07,219
-Thanks, Dad.
-You're welcome.

642
00:55:07,219 --> 00:55:08,470
More!

643
00:55:08,595 --> 00:55:11,640
I've got those yellowstain blues

644
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:14,434
Down from my head to my shoes

645
00:55:14,434 --> 00:55:17,354
Oh, you should see strong men quail

646
00:55:17,354 --> 00:55:20,148
If he should spy a shirttail

647
00:55:20,148 --> 00:55:21,817
All right, Harding. Cut it.

648
00:55:21,817 --> 00:55:24,987
Steve. Thought you'd be amused.

649
00:55:24,987 --> 00:55:27,364
This is a saga of a man
whose tack of charm...

650
00:55:27,364 --> 00:55:30,492
is exceeded only by his lack
of intestinal fortitude.

651
00:55:30,492 --> 00:55:32,661
It's not funny.
You ought to know better.

652
00:55:32,661 --> 00:55:34,997
Find somebody else to sing about.
That's an order!

653
00:55:34,997 --> 00:55:37,249
Why? Old Yellowstain
ought to be flattered.

654
00:55:37,249 --> 00:55:41,545
I don't wanna hear the name
Old yellowstain again.

655
00:55:41,545 --> 00:55:44,173
The captain wants a meeting
in the wardroom immediately.

656
00:55:46,842 --> 00:55:48,844
And he kids us not!

657
00:55:51,847 --> 00:55:53,849
Don't get up, gentlemen.

658
00:55:54,766 --> 00:55:57,519
I'm not feeling too well.

659
00:55:57,519 --> 00:55:59,771
What I have to say
won't take long.

660
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,650
That'll be all, steward.

661
00:56:12,534 --> 00:56:16,580
I know some of you were, perhaps,
a little afraid of me.

662
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:20,876
I'm not that terrible.
I have a wife, a child and a dog.

663
00:56:20,876 --> 00:56:23,045
They're rather fond of me.

664
00:56:23,045 --> 00:56:26,465
Even the dog doesn't think
I'm a monster.

665
00:56:29,301 --> 00:56:32,846
Perhaps certain things happened today.

666
00:56:32,846 --> 00:56:36,725
As I always say,
a command is a lonely job.

667
00:56:36,725 --> 00:56:39,228
It isn't easy to make decisions.

668
00:56:39,311 --> 00:56:44,316
Sometimes the captain of a ship needs
help--by help I mean...

669
00:56:44,316 --> 00:56:46,318
oonstructive loyalty.

670
00:56:47,736 --> 00:56:50,656
What I'm trying to say is...

671
00:56:50,656 --> 00:56:53,283
a ship is like a family.

672
00:56:53,283 --> 00:56:56,912
We all have our ideas
of right and wrong...

673
00:56:56,912 --> 00:57:00,249
but we have to pitch in
for the good of the family.

674
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:06,922
If there was only some way
we oould help each other.

675
00:57:10,592 --> 00:57:12,177
l--

676
00:57:14,346 --> 00:57:18,433
If there's anything any of you
would like to say...

677
00:57:18,433 --> 00:57:21,353
I'll be glad to listen.

678
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:36,368
Welt, I've spoken my piece.
I only hope it registers.

679
00:57:37,494 --> 00:57:39,454
Don't get up. Please.

680
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:44,293
Paynter.

681
00:57:44,293 --> 00:57:48,463
Have the pharmacist send some more
aspirin. My headache's much worse.

682
00:57:49,173 --> 00:57:51,049
Yes, sir.

683
00:58:00,976 --> 00:58:05,647
This is what is known in literature
as the pregnant pause.

684
00:58:26,293 --> 00:58:29,838
There's only one thing left to do:
Write to Walter Winohell.

685
00:58:31,089 --> 00:58:33,258
I almost felt sorry for him.

686
00:58:33,258 --> 00:58:35,677
Don't be so sentimental.

687
00:58:35,677 --> 00:58:38,263
I thought it was a pretty good speech.

688
00:58:38,263 --> 00:58:43,519
It was as close to an apology as
he could get. We could've backed him up.

689
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:47,689
What could we have said? He turned
yellow the first time we saw action.

690
00:58:47,689 --> 00:58:53,111
Look, Princeton, you knew nothing about
DeVriess; you know less about Queeg.

691
00:58:53,111 --> 00:58:56,198
He's a tired man.
His nerves are shot.

692
00:58:56,198 --> 00:59:00,202
It's happened before--a man loses his
head--after what Queeg's gone through.

693
00:59:00,202 --> 00:59:04,665
That's a very endearing explanation.
But it won't hold.

694
00:59:04,665 --> 00:59:07,793
Has it ever occurred to you
that our captain might be unbalanced?

695
00:59:07,793 --> 00:59:09,878
-Cut the jokes.
-I'm no psychiatrist...

696
00:59:09,878 --> 00:59:12,589
but I know something
about abnormal behavior.

697
00:59:12,589 --> 00:59:15,634
Captain Queeg has every symptom
of acute paranoia.

698
00:59:15,634 --> 00:59:18,846
It's just a question of time
before he goes over the line.

699
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:21,348
-Step outside, Keith.
-I'd like to stay.

700
00:59:21,348 --> 00:59:25,644
Let him.
He studied psychology at college.

701
00:59:25,644 --> 00:59:27,312
You're fooling with dynamite.

702
00:59:27,312 --> 00:59:28,856
Look at the man!

703
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:31,483
He's a Freudian delight.
He crawls with clues.

704
00:59:31,483 --> 00:59:33,735
His fixation
on the little rolling balls.

705
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:36,071
The chattering in secondhand
phrases and slogans.

706
00:59:36,071 --> 00:59:39,158
His inability to look you in the eye,
his migraine headaches.

707
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:42,911
Shirttails and tonight's pathetic
speech:

708
00:59:42,911 --> 00:59:45,831
"Forget about my turning yellow.
My dog likes me."

709
00:59:45,831 --> 00:59:48,250
I think Tom makes sense.

710
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:50,252
You stay out of this.

711
00:59:50,252 --> 00:59:53,046
All right.
So he has migraine headaches...

712
00:59:53,046 --> 00:59:56,175
and he rolls steel balls and does
other screwy things.

713
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:57,843
So what?

714
00:59:57,843 --> 01:00:01,597
You'd get up before reveille
and fill papers with scribbling.

715
01:00:01,597 --> 01:00:04,600
Everybody's a screwball in some way.
That doesn't make them crazy.

716
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,644
You'r e kidding yourself.

717
01:00:07,644 --> 01:00:11,106
Will you go over to the medical officer
with me...

718
01:00:11,106 --> 01:00:13,901
and repeat everything you've told me?

719
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:16,945
-Do you agree with my diagnosis?
-Not a word of it.

720
01:00:16,945 --> 01:00:20,282
-Even if I understood what you said.
-Well, then.

721
01:00:20,365 --> 01:00:22,784
Why should you expect me to take
this on my shoulders?

722
01:00:22,784 --> 01:00:25,287
If you don't see it,
I don't stand a chance.

723
01:00:25,287 --> 01:00:28,916
Then we drop it right now.

724
01:00:28,916 --> 01:00:32,461
There'll be no more talk
ahout the captain being crazy.

725
01:00:32,461 --> 01:00:35,297
Like running around explosives
with a blowtorch.

726
01:00:35,297 --> 01:00:38,634
I still insist he's a paranoia case.

727
01:00:42,804 --> 01:00:46,433
See this Bible?
I swear to you on this...

728
01:00:46,433 --> 01:00:50,187
I'll report to the captain anything
further you say along those lines.

729
01:00:50,187 --> 01:00:54,483
There's no more friendship
on this point. That's the straight dope.

730
01:01:28,767 --> 01:01:32,104
Medical log on
Lieutenant Commander X-Ray.

731
01:01:32,104 --> 01:01:36,692
This log is being started
because the possibility exists...

732
01:01:36,692 --> 01:01:40,529
that the commander of this ship
may be mentally disturbed.

733
01:01:43,448 --> 01:01:46,702
March 5th, 1944.

734
01:01:46,702 --> 01:01:52,624
This evening we were showing a
Hopalong Cassidy movie on the forecastle.

735
01:01:58,046 --> 01:02:02,342
Stop the picture!
Will you please stop this picture!

736
01:02:04,136 --> 01:02:06,221
Attention on deck

737
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:10,976
Why wasn't I notified
this movie was being shown?

738
01:02:10,976 --> 01:02:14,313
Last week you told me
you couldn't look at another Western.

739
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,814
-I just assumed--
-You assumed?

740
01:02:15,814 --> 01:02:18,901
This was calculated disrespect
to your commanding officer.

741
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:23,489
All right! There will be
no more movies for 30 days.

742
01:02:25,282 --> 01:02:28,494
May 28, 1944.

743
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:32,247
Morale couldn't be lower.
The crew is resentful...

744
01:02:32,247 --> 01:02:36,418
the officers just going through
the motions of carrying out orders.

745
01:02:36,418 --> 01:02:39,338
This afternoon the captain
held a general drill...

746
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:42,674
for the instruction
and safety of the crew.

747
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:16,041
This is the captain speaking.

748
01:03:16,041 --> 01:03:19,211
Many men have ignored my orders
about wearing battle gear.

749
01:03:19,211 --> 01:03:21,588
So there's only one way
to drive the point home.

750
01:03:21,588 --> 01:03:25,759
Men not wearing a helmet or life jacket
will be docked three-days' liberty.

751
01:03:36,603 --> 01:03:40,649
I see you!
Stop putting on that gear!

752
01:03:40,649 --> 01:03:44,820
Mr. Keith. Put that man down there
without a life jacket on report.

753
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:48,490
-Which one?
-That one down there on the machine gun!

754
01:03:51,326 --> 01:03:54,830
You people think you're very clever!
Well, you're not fooling me!

755
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:06,091
Get that redheaded fellow over there!

756
01:04:08,844 --> 01:04:11,847
I can't tell which one is redheaded.
They're all wearing helmets.

757
01:04:11,847 --> 01:04:14,433
Keith! You're an idiot!

758
01:04:19,271 --> 01:04:21,106
This is the captain.

759
01:04:21,106 --> 01:04:25,110
Some sailors still think
they can pull a fast one on me.

760
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:27,905
They're mistaken.
Since you've taken this course...

761
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:29,865
the innocent will be punished
with the guilty.

762
01:04:29,865 --> 01:04:33,202
No liberty for any crew member
for three months!

763
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:36,788
I will not be made a fool of!
Do you hear me?

764
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:38,457
July 30, 1944.

765
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:40,959
July 30, 1944.

766
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:45,297
Today we received a gift from
the officers of the U.S.S. Pinkney--

767
01:04:45,297 --> 01:04:48,342
a gallon of frozen strawberries.

768
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:53,972
I was checking the watch at 1:00 AM
when I stopped to speak to Ensign Keith.

769
01:04:53,972 --> 01:04:55,641
How's it going?

770
01:04:57,309 --> 01:05:00,729
Situation quiet. The captain's been
put away for the night.

771
01:05:00,729 --> 01:05:02,940
Lay off.

772
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:06,985
You know that I was with you
and against Tom in the beginning.

773
01:05:06,985 --> 01:05:10,656
But I don't see how the Caine
can go on like this much longer!

774
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,950
You haven't the experience to know
one way or another.

775
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:17,120
-I'm not blind! I've watched the man--
-All right.

776
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:21,416
The captain's in rocky shape,
but he'll oome out of it. He's got to.

777
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:25,462
Mr. Maryk, Mr. Keith. Captain wants
a meeting of all officers right away.

778
01:05:25,462 --> 01:05:27,756
-At 1:00 in the morning?
-Yes, sir.

779
01:05:27,756 --> 01:05:31,927
-You know what it's ahout?
-Yes, sir. Strawberries.

780
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:40,602
-You're sure this is a gallon can?
-Yes, sir. I took it from the pantry.

781
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:44,857
I suppose you're wondering
why I called this meeting.

782
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:50,195
You alt know we had an excellent dessert
of ice cream and frozen strawberries.

783
01:05:50,195 --> 01:05:54,032
About an hour ago, I sent Whittaker
to bring me another portion.

784
01:05:54,032 --> 01:05:56,451
He came back with the ice cream,
but he said...

785
01:05:56,451 --> 01:05:59,955
"Sir, there ain't no more strawberries."'

786
01:05:59,955 --> 01:06:04,376
Gentlemen, I don't believe
that the officers of this ship...

787
01:06:04,376 --> 01:06:06,336
consumed a full gallon of strawberries.

788
01:06:06,336 --> 01:06:08,005
I intend to prove it.

789
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:14,887
How many portions of ice cream
and strawberries did you have?

790
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:17,055
-Two, sir.
-Whittaker.

791
01:06:17,055 --> 01:06:19,683
Dole out a scoop of sand
for eaoh portion of strawberries.

792
01:06:19,683 --> 01:06:20,934
Yes, sir.

793
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:30,652
-Mr. Keefer, how many for you?
-Three, Captain.

794
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:38,660
-Keith?
-Two, sir.

795
01:06:40,245 --> 01:06:42,206
-Harding?
-Two, sir.

796
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:49,171
-Paynter?
-Two, sir.

797
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:56,094
-Carmody?
-Two, sir.

798
01:06:56,094 --> 01:06:57,930
-Jorgenson?
-Two, sir.

799
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,185
-Rabbit?
-Two, sir.

800
01:07:05,854 --> 01:07:08,357
And the steward's mates had three,
right?

801
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,442
Yes, sir. One helping eaoh.

802
01:07:10,442 --> 01:07:14,321
-Mr. Keith said it was okay.
-Yes, I did, sir.

803
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:19,451
And I had four.

804
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:21,119
Two--

805
01:07:22,454 --> 01:07:24,456
Twenty-four portions in all.

806
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:33,924
This tureen holds an amount of sand
equal to the strawberries we had.

807
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:36,301
-Right, Whittaker?
-Yes, sir.

808
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:40,305
Look at this gallon can and tell me
how much sand is left.

809
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:45,727
A quart or less.

810
01:07:50,899 --> 01:07:54,570
Have any of you an explanation
for the quart of missing strawberries?

811
01:07:57,156 --> 01:08:00,075
There can be no doub t
someone finished them for us.

812
01:08:00,075 --> 01:08:02,828
You are all appointed
a board of investigation...

813
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:05,622
to find out who's responsible
for this theft.

814
01:08:05,622 --> 01:08:08,000
Mr. Maryk, you are the senior member.

815
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,419
You mean in the morning?

816
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:13,005
Now does not mean in the morning.

817
01:08:13,005 --> 01:08:15,090
It means 0147.

818
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:18,343
I expeot a full report by 0800.

819
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:26,059
All right! Pipe down. The faster we get
this done, the faster we get sleep.

820
01:08:26,059 --> 01:08:29,271
-Send in the stewards, one at a time.
-Yes, sir.

821
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:34,276
If the strawberries had been poisoned
our problems would have been solved.

822
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:38,280
Strawberries, anyone?

823
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:48,582
-Unsatisfactory.
-I'm sorry, Captain.

824
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:50,959
We kept the mess boys and the cook
most of the night.

825
01:08:50,959 --> 01:08:53,170
They may be lying, but it's a dead end.

826
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:55,464
We couldn't keep covering
the ground endlessly.

827
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:59,009
You spent the entire night
and accomplished nothing...

828
01:08:59,009 --> 01:09:02,054
while I've thought
the whole thing out very clearly.

829
01:09:02,054 --> 01:09:06,934
Did it ever occur to you that some boy
made a duplicate key to the icebox?

830
01:09:06,934 --> 01:09:08,727
There's no indication--

831
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:12,564
There's some things we must assume
in order to be a good officer.

832
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:17,653
Baok in '3T when I was
a lowly ensign on a cruiser...

833
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,280
five pounds of cheese was missing.

834
01:09:20,280 --> 01:09:23,617
Everybody was willing
to forget about it. But not me.

835
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:29,331
I snooped and found some chowhound
had made a wax impression of the key.

836
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:32,918
I made him confess and got myself
a nice letter of commendation.

837
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:35,295
This looks to me
like exactly the same situation.

838
01:09:35,295 --> 01:09:39,049
-We can't be sure there's--
-You've tried every other solution.

839
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:41,426
I've worked out a very simple plan.

840
01:09:41,426 --> 01:09:45,722
First, we collect every key on this ship
and tag it with the name of the owner.

841
01:09:45,722 --> 01:09:49,476
Second, we strip all hands
to make sure we've got all keys.

842
01:09:49,476 --> 01:09:54,064
Third, we test each key
on the icebox padlock.

843
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:56,692
The one that fits
will give us the name of the owner.

844
01:09:56,692 --> 01:10:00,445
-How do we know there's such a key?
-I say there's a key.

845
01:10:00,445 --> 01:10:04,783
Captain, what's to prevent this boy
from tossing the key overboard?

846
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:10,122
No. He'd never toss it after he's gone
to all the trouble making it.

847
01:10:10,122 --> 01:10:12,207
He may try to hide it,
but we'll find it.

848
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,127
I never thought of that.

849
01:10:15,127 --> 01:10:17,212
Don't stand there.
Get on the ball.

850
01:10:17,212 --> 01:10:20,215
We'll have a little fun,
now that we've detective work to do.

851
01:10:20,215 --> 01:10:21,884
Yes, sir.

852
01:10:30,225 --> 01:10:33,270
Turn me in if you want to,
but this is it. This is over the line.

853
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:36,064
Queeg is a paranoid
or there's no such thing as paranoia.

854
01:10:36,064 --> 01:10:38,817
-I warned you.
-Can't you see what he's doing?

855
01:10:38,817 --> 01:10:41,320
He's reenacting the big triumph
of his career :

856
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,988
The cheese investigation.

857
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:46,742
He wants to prove he's still
the red-hot Queeg of 193T.

858
01:10:46,742 --> 01:10:48,994
There is no key.

859
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:51,330
-What happened to the strawberries?
-Does it matter?

860
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:54,124
Is it worth turning a ship
upside-down?

861
01:10:54,124 --> 01:10:56,627
Woutd anyone hut a crazy man do it?

862
01:11:01,215 --> 01:11:04,760
Are you familiar with Article 184
of navy regulations?

863
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,220
Vaguely.

864
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:14,019
Here. Listen to this:

865
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:18,106
On the Caine it's required reading.

866
01:11:18,106 --> 01:11:20,609
"Article 184 :

867
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:24,238
It is conceivable that most unusual
circumstances may arise...

868
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:28,200
in which the relief from duty of a
commanding officer becomes necessary...

869
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:32,079
either by placing him under arrest
or on the sick list.

870
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:35,541
Such actions are not to he taken without
approval of the Navy Department...

871
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:40,337
except when it is impracticable
because of the delay involved."

872
01:11:42,297 --> 01:11:45,300
If I were you, I'd memorize it.

873
01:12:04,736 --> 01:12:07,322
I'll take these to the captain.

874
01:12:09,741 --> 01:12:13,704
-Great weather for stripping down.
-Great for pneumonia.

875
01:12:13,704 --> 01:12:16,582
-That wouldn't stop the investigation.
-Next.

876
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:20,335
-Meatball, get dressed.
-Don't you wanna x-ray me for the key?

877
01:12:20,335 --> 01:12:24,214
I've seen him! He swallowed the key
with his coffee. Very tricky!

878
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:26,216
Pipe down, both of you.

879
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,679
So long, fellas.

880
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:34,433
Don't tell me you're escaping
from the Caine.

881
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:37,853
I got dispatch orders hack
to the states. My wife is seriously ill.

882
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:40,814
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-She'll be all right.

883
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,484
We'll keep you posted on the outcome
of the great key investigation.

884
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,569
-Do that.
-Good luck.

885
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:47,571
Thank you, sir.

886
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:53,702
If I tell you something, will you
promise not to do anything about it?

887
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:55,621
At least till I'm ashore?

888
01:12:57,998 --> 01:13:01,043
-Okay, what is it?
-There is no key.

889
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:04,796
-What?
-How do you know?

890
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,717
I know. The mess boys
ate the strawberries. I saw them.

891
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:11,887
I didn't want to get them
into trouble.

892
01:13:11,887 --> 01:13:15,098
Then I made my mistake.
I told the captain.

893
01:13:15,098 --> 01:13:19,144
He called me a liar and threatened to
hold up my orders if I mentioned it.

894
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:20,813
Pfease, don't say anything.

895
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:22,523
You can count on us.

896
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:25,108
Boy, am I happy to get out
of this madhouse.

897
01:13:25,108 --> 01:13:26,902
So long, and good luck.

898
01:13:30,405 --> 01:13:33,742
I'll call all your wives
and girls for you.

899
01:13:35,619 --> 01:13:37,120
Well?

900
01:13:39,289 --> 01:13:41,875
I've been thinking about
what you've said.

901
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:46,505
I've been thinking ahout Article 184,
and I've got to admit you're right.

902
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:48,674
Admiral Halsey's here with the fleet.

903
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:53,345
How about seeing him
after we finish with this nonsense?

904
01:13:53,345 --> 01:13:55,430
Sure.

905
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:57,516
You too, Willie.

906
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:46,440
Request permission to come on board--
Admiral Halsey's quarters.

907
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:50,486
-Official business from the Caine.
-Very well. Lieutenant Jones?

908
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:55,073
-He'd like to see the admiral.
-Very well. Come with me.

909
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:45,040
Just a minute please, gentlemen.

910
01:15:58,387 --> 01:16:03,475
This is a fine time to think of this,
but we're making a big mistake.

911
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:05,561
-What are you talking about?
-Look at this!

912
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:10,983
We've been kidding ourselves.
This is the real navy!

913
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:13,193
With real officers, not Queegs!

914
01:16:13,193 --> 01:16:15,696
The Caine's a freak, a floating mistake.

915
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:19,867
-What are you driving at?
-They'll never believe our story.

916
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:22,911
f don't get it.
Is Queeg off his head or isn't he?

917
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,914
-Is this record correct or not?
-Yes, it's correct.

918
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:28,333
The trouble is, we won't be able
to make it stick.

919
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:33,005
Everything you've got in your log oan be
interpreted as an attempt at discipline.

920
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:35,924
-But we know different.
-Because we've lived through it.

921
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:39,261
-Halsey hasn't.
-Why didn't you tell me this before?

922
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:43,515
Just he glad I thought of it now. If we
go through with this, we're in trouble.

923
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:46,018
It won't mean as much to Wilfie and me
as it will to you.

924
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,811
You want to stay in the navy.

925
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:51,148
Do you want them thinking
you're a mutinous officer?

926
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:55,444
-Tom has an argument there.
-I'm willing to take a chance.

927
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,821
-Are you scared?
-Scared?

928
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:01,867
I see six sides to every risk
and 12 reasons not to take it.

929
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:03,660
Cut the kidding.

930
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:08,957
Behind this brilliant, eloquent
exterior, I've got a wide yellow streak.

931
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:10,876
I'm too smart to be brave.

932
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:14,379
Admiral Halsey will see you now.

933
01:17:14,379 --> 01:17:18,258
-I pass.
-Thank the admiral.

934
01:17:18,258 --> 01:17:20,844
We've decided this isn't the time.

935
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:27,017
Sfafions. Special sea and anchor detail.

936
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:29,812
Make all preparations
for getting underway.

937
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:32,439
Make all preparations for heavy weather.

938
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:34,399
Dismissed from quarters.

939
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:51,333
Steve, what do we do now?

940
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:53,710
Without Tom, I couldn't get
to first base.

941
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:56,755
I'd never even heard the word paranoid.

942
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,841
He's got to make the pitch
or we're sunk.

943
01:17:58,841 --> 01:18:02,177
t don't get it.
Tom's certainly not a coward.

944
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:05,389
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what Tom is now.

945
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:09,852
You'd better double-time back to your
ship. We've received a storm warning.

946
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:11,770
The fleet's getting underway.

947
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:43,111
-Turn on the standard lights.
-Aye, sir.

948
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:49,368
Sir, the barometer's still dropping.

949
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:53,831
-I've seen it.
-The chief engineer wants to know...

950
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:55,624
if you're gonna take on ballast?

951
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:58,293
-Tell him no.
-I suggest that we do.

952
01:19:58,293 --> 01:20:01,213
I'm not going to foul up his fuel lines
with salt water.

953
01:20:32,119 --> 01:20:35,539
This following sea is brutal!
We need more knots to outrun it.

954
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:39,585
Bridge to engine control.
This is the captain.

955
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:42,087
You in the engine room,
f want power.

956
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:44,423
Power on the starboard engine,
do you hear?

957
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:46,383
Emergenoy flank power.

958
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:48,886
Do you want the ship to go down?
We're in a typhoon!

959
01:20:55,058 --> 01:20:56,935
Close that door!

960
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:03,275
-Sir, I've relieved the watch.
-Pass the word to put on life jackets.

961
01:21:07,571 --> 01:21:10,991
It's difficult holding her, sir!
The wheel feels loose.

962
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:14,203
I don't know if we can keep riding
with our stern to the wind!

963
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:15,996
Those are fleet orders.

964
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:18,790
I think the depth charges
should be put on safe.

965
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:21,960
They are on safe.
Mr. Keefer gave me orders to set them.

966
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:25,380
Why wasn't I told? I can't go steaming
around with a lot of dead charges!

967
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:27,883
-I told Mr. Keefer--
-Speak when you're spoken to!

968
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:31,303
Put this man on report
for insolence and neglect of duty!

969
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:34,473
Get another helmsman.
Keep that idiot's face out of my sight!

970
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:37,976
-Stilwell's our best man!
-Will you stop this hack talk!

971
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:41,313
Isn't there one officer
that pays attention to my orders?

972
01:21:43,941 --> 01:21:48,946
Number one switchboard shorted out
by salt water! Shifted to number two!

973
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,660
We're falling off to starboard!

974
01:21:57,704 --> 01:22:01,250
We're abroaching-to!
Try backing the starboard engine!

975
01:22:02,292 --> 01:22:04,461
Sir! Back-to starboard engine!

976
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:17,099
Look in the radar shack.
See if there are any ships near us.

977
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:19,059
Aye, aye, sir.

978
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:29,194
If we keep running with our stern
to the wind, we'll roll over!

979
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:32,739
The radars are jammed
There's no sign of the fleet!

980
01:22:32,739 --> 01:22:34,533
Passing 2-2-5!

981
01:22:34,533 --> 01:22:36,201
Swinging very fast!

982
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:38,996
We have to maneuver
for the safety of the ship!

983
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:43,584
We've received no orders to maneuver.
Fleet course is 1-8-0.

984
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:46,170
How do you know what
the fleet's orders are now?

985
01:22:46,170 --> 01:22:48,463
We can call fleet commander
and tell him we're in trouble!

986
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,132
We're not in trouble.

987
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:06,523
Heading 2-4-5! I can't hold the wheel!

988
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:22,915
Back-to starboard engine!

989
01:23:39,056 --> 01:23:41,016
Stilwell, hold her to hard right!

990
01:23:44,478 --> 01:23:46,855
Ease your rudder to standard!

991
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:48,857
Rudder easing to standard!

992
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:53,028
Heading 3-2-5.
She's coming around slower, sir!

993
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,289
We'll do much better
heading into the wind.

994
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:07,501
Steady on 0-0-0!

995
01:24:07,501 --> 01:24:11,672
Who gave those orders?
Fleet course is 1-8-0!

996
01:24:11,672 --> 01:24:13,882
Captain, we're in serious trouble!

997
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:17,719
If you question my decisions again,
I'll order you off this bridge.

998
01:24:17,719 --> 01:24:18,971
Come left!

999
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:30,232
Stilwell, steady as you go.
Willie, note the time.

1000
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:36,613
Captain, I'm sorry,
but you're a sick man.

1001
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:40,367
I'm relieving you as captain
under Article 184.

1002
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:42,661
I don't know what you're talking about!

1003
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:44,955
Helmsman, left, 1-8-0!

1004
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:48,834
Mr. Keith, what do I do?
You're the officer of the deck.

1005
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:51,420
I told you to come left!
Come left and fast!

1006
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:55,257
I'm sorry, but you're not issuing orders
on this bridge anymore.

1007
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:58,427
I've relieved you.
I take full responsibility.

1008
01:24:58,427 --> 01:25:01,513
You're under arrest.
Go below to your cabin.

1009
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:04,683
-Left to 1-8-0.
-Right standard rudder!

1010
01:25:04,683 --> 01:25:06,518
New course, 0-0-0!

1011
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:08,437
Mr. Keith, what do I do?

1012
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,274
Come north, Stilwell.
Mr. Maryk has taken command.

1013
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:16,445
Call your relief!
You're under arrest too!

1014
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:21,116
All officers not on watch
report to the bridge! This is Maryk.

1015
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:39,593
-What's up?
-I have just relieved the captain.

1016
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:42,513
He will continue to be treated
with courtesy...

1017
01:25:42,513 --> 01:25:45,724
but from now on,
I will give all orders!

1018
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:48,227
I take full responsibility
for this action.

1019
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:50,646
Don't kid yourself!
Mr. Keith hacked you up.

1020
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:53,065
He'll pay the same as you will!

1021
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:58,779
Officers, if you know what's good for
you, tell them to stop while they can!

1022
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:02,825
You officers approve?

1023
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:04,409
Do you, Mr. Keefer?

1024
01:26:05,786 --> 01:26:08,163
It's not up to Mr. Keefer
to approve.

1025
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:10,457
You'll all hang
for conspiracy to mutiny!

1026
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:15,337
Everybody back to their stations.
Hold the course 0-0-0.

1027
01:26:45,701 --> 01:26:48,078
-It's right over there.
-Thank you.

1028
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:54,251
Yes. This is Ensign Keith.

1029
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:57,296
New York?

1030
01:26:58,005 --> 01:26:59,673
Thank you.

1031
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:02,176
Hello?

1032
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:10,434
I've been trying to get you all day.
Are you all right?

1033
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:11,977
I'm okay. How are you?

1034
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:15,731
An officer from your ship called.

1035
01:27:15,731 --> 01:27:19,067
Ensign Harding. He told me
that you were in trouble.

1036
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,861
I'm worried.

1037
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:25,240
Is your mother with you?

1038
01:27:25,324 --> 01:27:28,327
No. She's in Washington.
Uncle Lloyd's sick.

1039
01:27:28,327 --> 01:27:30,120
I'm sorry to hear it.

1040
01:27:31,497 --> 01:27:34,416
It was wonderful of you to phone.

1041
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:39,087
May, darling--

1042
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:42,216
Willie, please don't.

1043
01:27:42,216 --> 01:27:44,384
What an idiot I was.

1044
01:27:45,761 --> 01:27:50,057
I could have married you in
the most beautiful place in the world.

1045
01:27:50,057 --> 01:27:52,643
I'll regret that I didn't
for the rest of my life.

1046
01:27:55,854 --> 01:28:00,150
Please. It's over.
It's all in the past.

1047
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:06,281
But I want you to know that I love you.
And I'll never forget you.

1048
01:28:07,950 --> 01:28:09,952
Good-bye, Willie.

1049
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:13,705
Thank you.

1050
01:28:46,738 --> 01:28:48,740
-Mr. Maryk?
-I'm Maryk.

1051
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:51,451
My name's Barney Greenwald.

1052
01:28:51,451 --> 01:28:53,662
Pleased to meet you.
Have a crack-up?

1053
01:28:53,662 --> 01:28:55,497
Yeah.

1054
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:58,876
-Are you our lawyer?
-Well, I'm a lawyer.

1055
01:28:58,876 --> 01:29:01,336
This is Ensign Keith.
Lieutenant Keefer.

1056
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,839
-You're the co-defendant?
-Yes, sir.

1057
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:06,466
-And you, Mr. Keefer?
-I'm holding his coat.

1058
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:09,511
-What does that mean?
-I'm a friend of the family.

1059
01:29:09,511 --> 01:29:11,680
That's pretty flip
under the circumstances.

1060
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,434
Sorry. I was on board the Caine.
Communications officer.

1061
01:29:16,059 --> 01:29:17,728
I'm gonna be frank.

1062
01:29:17,728 --> 01:29:22,316
I've read the preliminary investigation,
and what you've done stinks.

1063
01:29:22,316 --> 01:29:25,235
If that's how you feel,
why are you taking the case?

1064
01:29:25,235 --> 01:29:29,281
I didn't say I'd take it. I told legal
I'd have a talk with Mr. Maryk.

1065
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:31,366
It depends on what he has to say.

1066
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:33,452
Maybe you'd better get another lawyer.

1067
01:29:33,452 --> 01:29:37,456
Try it. Eight other officers
have already turned it down.

1068
01:29:37,456 --> 01:29:41,168
I don't want to upset you, but you have
an excellent chance of being hanged.

1069
01:29:43,045 --> 01:29:45,797
We'll answer anything you wanna know.

1070
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:48,383
All right. Which are you?

1071
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:51,220
A fool or a mutineer?
There's no third possibility.

1072
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:55,891
The only way I could prove
I was right was to let the ship go down.

1073
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:59,436
-Three ships were lost in the typhoon.
-Sure.

1074
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:02,648
And 194 stayed afloat
without relieving the skipper.

1075
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:06,318
-There wasn't any other choice!
-Hold it.

1076
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:09,238
Maybe I was a fool,
but I'm not a mutineer.

1077
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:11,532
He should get a medal for what he did.

1078
01:30:11,532 --> 01:30:14,743
He had a paranoid skipper who
fell apart when the ship was in danger.

1079
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:16,411
He saved the ship.

1080
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:20,707
The navy has three psychiatrists
prepared to say Oueeg is sane.

1081
01:30:20,707 --> 01:30:23,210
Sure. Paranoids are clever.

1082
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:26,463
They walk a thin line
between sanity and lunacy.

1083
01:30:28,215 --> 01:30:29,883
Are you a psychiatrist?

1084
01:30:29,883 --> 01:30:33,637
No, I'm a writer. It's my business
to be a judge of human behavior.

1085
01:30:33,637 --> 01:30:38,016
I see. And you were the first to notioe
the captain's psychotic symptoms?

1086
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:39,685
Yes.

1087
01:30:39,685 --> 01:30:42,813
You explained all this to Mr. Maryk?

1088
01:30:42,813 --> 01:30:44,773
I discussed it.

1089
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:49,194
That's an interesting point. Are you
ready to repeat it on the witness stand?

1090
01:30:49,194 --> 01:30:51,488
Why not?

1091
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:56,368
You ought to take a look
at Article 186 of navy regulations.

1092
01:30:57,828 --> 01:31:01,915
"An officer relieving his commanding
officer, or recommending such action...

1093
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:04,710
together with afI others
who so council...

1094
01:31:04,710 --> 01:31:10,549
must bear the legitimate responsibility
and must justify such aotion."

1095
01:31:10,549 --> 01:31:12,342
That's confusing the issue.

1096
01:31:12,342 --> 01:31:14,720
I'm not on trial.
If I were, I'd take the rap.

1097
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:18,682
It's too bad we can't use you
as an expert on psychiatry.

1098
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:20,976
After all, you made the diagnosis.

1099
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:22,561
Yes.

1100
01:31:25,355 --> 01:31:28,901
The atmosphere's getting
a little thick in here.

1101
01:31:28,901 --> 01:31:32,446
If you can get along without me,
I'll wait in the hall.

1102
01:31:32,446 --> 01:31:35,657
Tom had nothing to do with it.
It was my decision.

1103
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:39,661
-Nobody told me what to do.
-Sure.

1104
01:31:39,745 --> 01:31:41,830
Will you take the case?

1105
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:43,999
I'd much rather prosecute.

1106
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,504
Well, I guess I can't blame you.

1107
01:31:53,300 --> 01:31:55,093
I'll take it.

1108
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:59,765
-How do we plead?
-Your case depends on Maryk.

1109
01:31:59,765 --> 01:32:03,727
-Then how do I plead?
-Not guilty, of course.

1110
01:32:03,727 --> 01:32:05,687
You're a great naval hero.

1111
01:32:07,773 --> 01:32:10,192
"Charge: making a mutiny.

1112
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:14,780
Specification: In that, Stephen Maryk,
United States Naval Reserve...

1113
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:20,118
while serving on board the U.S.S. Caine,
did, on or about July 31, 1944...

1114
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:23,038
willfully, forcibly,
and without proper authority...

1115
01:32:23,038 --> 01:32:26,792
relieve Lieutenant Commander
Philip Queeg, U.S. Navy...

1116
01:32:26,792 --> 01:32:30,295
who was then and there engaged in
the lawful exercise of his command--

1117
01:32:30,295 --> 01:32:32,923
the United States then being
in a state of war.

1118
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:39,304
You've heard the charge
and specification preferred against you.

1119
01:32:39,304 --> 01:32:42,224
How say you to the specification?
Guilty or not guilty?

1120
01:32:42,224 --> 01:32:44,476
-Not guilty.
-How say you to the charge?

1121
01:32:44,601 --> 01:32:48,063
-Guilty or not guilty?
-Not guilty.

1122
01:32:52,818 --> 01:32:56,405
The prosecution is prepared to prove...

1123
01:32:56,405 --> 01:32:59,199
that the removal of Lieutenant Commander
Oueeg was not justified...

1124
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:01,577
by any provision
of the U.S. Navy regulations...

1125
01:33:01,577 --> 01:33:05,581
and consequently constituted the making
of a mutiny against legal authority.

1126
01:33:06,498 --> 01:33:11,003
We'll also submit psychiatric testimony,
establishing, without a doubt...

1127
01:33:11,003 --> 01:33:14,423
that Lieutenant Commander Queeg
is a sane, intelligent officer...

1128
01:33:14,423 --> 01:33:16,925
and should not have been relieved.

1129
01:33:18,385 --> 01:33:20,471
No statement at this time.

1130
01:33:20,471 --> 01:33:23,265
In order to establish
the circumstances...

1131
01:33:23,265 --> 01:33:29,021
the prosecution would like to first call
Ensign Willis Keith.

1132
01:33:29,021 --> 01:33:33,192
Mr. Keith, were you the officer
of the deok on the D.M.S. Caine...

1133
01:33:33,192 --> 01:33:35,277
during the morning of July 31st?

1134
01:33:35,277 --> 01:33:36,445
Yes.

1135
01:33:36,528 --> 01:33:41,325
Was the captain relieved by
the executive officer during that watch?

1136
01:33:41,325 --> 01:33:44,453
-Yes, sir.
-Do you know why he took that action?

1137
01:33:44,453 --> 01:33:45,913
I do.

1138
01:33:47,289 --> 01:33:51,335
The captain lost control of himself, and
the ship was in danger of foundering.

1139
01:33:51,335 --> 01:33:53,545
Have you ever been in a ship
that foundered?

1140
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:58,008
-No, sir.
-How long have you been in the navy?

1141
01:33:58,967 --> 01:34:00,219
Just over a year.

1142
01:34:00,302 --> 01:34:04,890
Do you know how many years Lieutenant
Commander Queeg served at sea?

1143
01:34:04,890 --> 01:34:07,184
-No.
-As a matter of fact...

1144
01:34:07,184 --> 01:34:10,229
he's served over eight years.

1145
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:14,691
Which of you is better qualified
to judge if a ship is foundering?

1146
01:34:15,651 --> 01:34:18,153
Myself, sir...

1147
01:34:18,237 --> 01:34:21,365
when l'm in possession of my faculties
and Commander Queeg is not.

1148
01:34:21,365 --> 01:34:25,953
Tell me, just how would you describe
this loss of faculties?

1149
01:34:25,953 --> 01:34:29,581
Did the captain rave
or make insane gestures?

1150
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,501
Well, no.

1151
01:34:32,501 --> 01:34:35,420
After being relieved,
did he go violently crazy?

1152
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:40,342
He was never wild or raving
either before or after being relieved.

1153
01:34:40,342 --> 01:34:42,219
There are other forms
of mental illness.

1154
01:34:42,219 --> 01:34:45,264
Thank you for your expert opinion.

1155
01:34:45,264 --> 01:34:49,726
Are you aware he's been pronounced
rational by 3 qualified psychiatrists?

1156
01:34:49,726 --> 01:34:53,272
They weren't on the bridge
during that typhoon.

1157
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:57,109
Did you like the captain?

1158
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:59,111
-At first I did.
-And later?

1159
01:35:00,279 --> 01:35:04,533
Well, I felt he was incompetent
and unfair.

1160
01:35:04,533 --> 01:35:07,661
He blamed the crew for his mistakes
and rode the men too hard.

1161
01:35:07,661 --> 01:35:10,873
-Yourself included?
-Yes.

1162
01:35:10,873 --> 01:35:12,875
So you ended up by hating
Captain Queeg?

1163
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:16,420
Yes.

1164
01:35:16,420 --> 01:35:19,756
Let's come to the morning
of the 31st of July.

1165
01:35:19,756 --> 01:35:22,676
Was your decision to obey Mr. Maryk...

1166
01:35:22,676 --> 01:35:25,387
based upon your judgement
that the captain had gone crazy...

1167
01:35:25,387 --> 01:35:29,475
or was it based on your hatred
of Captain Oueeg?

1168
01:35:34,146 --> 01:35:38,233
It's contempt of court to refuse
to answer questions.

1169
01:35:40,486 --> 01:35:43,322
I believe Mr. Maryk did the right thing.

1170
01:35:44,573 --> 01:35:47,075
That's all.
No further questions.

1171
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:52,289
I'd like to ask you
if you've ever heard the expression...

1172
01:35:52,289 --> 01:35:53,957
"Of Old Yellowstain"?

1173
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:55,626
Could you repeat that?

1174
01:36:00,422 --> 01:36:02,716
-I've heard it.
-Was it a nickname?

1175
01:36:02,716 --> 01:36:04,510
Yes. For Captain Oueeg.

1176
01:36:04,510 --> 01:36:08,263
-What did it imply?
-It implied cowardice.

1177
01:36:08,263 --> 01:36:11,767
I object. I move that question
be struck from the record...

1178
01:36:11,767 --> 01:36:14,520
as an unnecessary attack upon the honor
of a naval officer.

1179
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:20,108
The career of an officer with a 14-year
unblemished record is involved here.

1180
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:22,528
The court understands your zeal,
but I warn you...

1181
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:26,198
you bear fufI responsibility
for your conduct of the case.

1182
01:36:26,198 --> 01:36:28,992
The court holds in abeyance
the prosecution's motion.

1183
01:36:30,786 --> 01:36:33,288
Did that nickname have anything
to do with the typhoon?

1184
01:36:35,374 --> 01:36:38,168
-No, sir.
-That's all.

1185
01:36:38,168 --> 01:36:39,962
No further questions.

1186
01:36:40,045 --> 01:36:42,756
The court has no questions.

1187
01:36:42,756 --> 01:36:45,968
You are warned not to discuss
your testimony with anyone...

1188
01:36:45,968 --> 01:36:48,887
except the parties to the trial
and the accused.

1189
01:36:48,887 --> 01:36:50,889
You're excused.

1190
01:36:52,057 --> 01:36:54,977
The ship was rollin' real bad.
I couldn't hold her.

1191
01:36:54,977 --> 01:36:57,646
Captain wanted me to come left,
and the exec wanted me to oome right.

1192
01:36:57,646 --> 01:37:00,274
-Which did you do?
-I obeyed Mr. Maryk, sir.

1193
01:37:00,274 --> 01:37:03,735
-Why?
-Mr. Keith said Mr. Maryk had command.

1194
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:06,238
-Did the captain act crazy?
-No.

1195
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:08,615
-Did Mr. Maryk act crazy?
-No.

1196
01:37:08,615 --> 01:37:10,492
-Did the captain seem soared?
-No.

1197
01:37:10,492 --> 01:37:12,161
-Did Mr. Maryk seem scared?
-No.

1198
01:37:12,161 --> 01:37:14,663
-Did any one?
-Just me. I was da--

1199
01:37:14,663 --> 01:37:16,665
I was plenty scared.

1200
01:37:17,666 --> 01:37:20,586
-Did you like Captain Queeg?
-I liked him.

1201
01:37:20,586 --> 01:37:23,922
Not a tot, but I liked him.

1202
01:37:23,922 --> 01:37:25,841
He acted strange.

1203
01:37:25,841 --> 01:37:28,635
Was it strange he cleaned up
the Caine?

1204
01:37:28,635 --> 01:37:31,972
Was it strange
he made the men get haircuts?

1205
01:37:31,972 --> 01:37:34,349
Was it strange he was strict
about navy regulations?

1206
01:37:34,349 --> 01:37:36,560
-No.
-What you thought strange...

1207
01:37:36,685 --> 01:37:39,605
was his attempts to make
good sailors of his crew.

1208
01:37:40,022 --> 01:37:41,356
That's all.

1209
01:37:41,356 --> 01:37:43,358
What do those stars represent?

1210
01:37:46,153 --> 01:37:48,447
What do they represent?

1211
01:37:48,447 --> 01:37:52,117
This silver star is the Coral Sea,
Midway, Guadalcanal, Tulagi--

1212
01:37:52,117 --> 01:37:53,535
That's all.

1213
01:37:54,286 --> 01:37:57,289
Call Lieutenant Thomas Keefer.

1214
01:37:57,289 --> 01:37:57,706
When did you first learn
about Captain Queeg's relief?

1215
01:37:57,706 --> 01:38:00,959
When did you first learn
about Captain Queeg's relief?

1216
01:38:00,959 --> 01:38:03,128
Mr. Maryk oaf led us to the bridge.

1217
01:38:03,128 --> 01:38:06,048
When we arrived, he told us
he'd assumed command.

1218
01:38:06,048 --> 01:38:09,718
Did Captain Queeg show any
external signs of being sick?

1219
01:38:09,718 --> 01:38:13,555
At the height of a typhoon,
nobody looks very well.

1220
01:38:13,555 --> 01:38:18,268
Didn't you realize that Captain Queeg's
warning to the other officers...

1221
01:38:18,268 --> 01:38:21,480
about collusion in mutiny
was well-founded?

1222
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:25,359
-I did.
-Then why did you take no action?

1223
01:38:25,359 --> 01:38:28,070
I wasn't present when
the captain was relieved.

1224
01:38:28,070 --> 01:38:30,155
So I didn't know what he'd done
in a critical moment...

1225
01:38:30,155 --> 01:38:32,866
to have convinced the executive
officer he was sick.

1226
01:38:33,826 --> 01:38:37,746
For the safety of the ship, my best
course was to obey Mr. Maryk's order...

1227
01:38:37,746 --> 01:38:42,167
until such time as higher authority
endorsed or overruled his action.

1228
01:38:43,418 --> 01:38:47,756
During all the period Captain Queeg
was in command of the Caine...

1229
01:38:47,756 --> 01:38:51,009
did you observe any evidence
of insanity in him?

1230
01:38:51,927 --> 01:38:55,931
I can't answer that question
intelligently, not being a psychiatrist.

1231
01:38:55,931 --> 01:39:00,811
Did you ever have any reason to think
Captain Queeg might be insane?

1232
01:39:00,811 --> 01:39:02,771
Objection.
The witness isn't an expert.

1233
01:39:02,771 --> 01:39:06,441
Matters of opinion
are not permissible evidence.

1234
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:07,901
Strike it from the record.

1235
01:39:07,901 --> 01:39:11,530
At anytime prior to the 31st of July...

1236
01:39:11,655 --> 01:39:15,117
did you know Mr. Maryk suspected
Captain Queeg of being mentally if I?

1237
01:39:16,034 --> 01:39:17,786
Yes.

1238
01:39:17,786 --> 01:39:21,123
Mr. Maryk showed me a medical log
he'd written on Queeg's behavior.

1239
01:39:21,874 --> 01:39:25,419
Did you believe that log justified
the relief of Captain Queeg?

1240
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:31,049
-Well, sir--
-Yes or no.

1241
01:39:37,723 --> 01:39:38,974
No, sir.

1242
01:39:40,976 --> 01:39:44,062
Mr. Maryk was a close friend of mine.

1243
01:39:44,062 --> 01:39:48,233
He persuaded Mr. Keith and me
to see Admiral Halsey.

1244
01:39:48,233 --> 01:39:51,153
When we arrived, I told him
as forcibly as I could...

1245
01:39:51,153 --> 01:39:54,198
that the log didn't justify
such action...

1246
01:39:54,198 --> 01:39:56,700
and that we'd all be liable
to a charge of mutiny.

1247
01:39:57,659 --> 01:40:00,037
Were you surprised
when Mr. Maryk relieved the captain?

1248
01:40:01,413 --> 01:40:03,916
I was flabbergasted.

1249
01:40:03,916 --> 01:40:06,168
Were you pleased?

1250
01:40:07,419 --> 01:40:10,589
I've said Mr. Maryk was a close friend.

1251
01:40:10,589 --> 01:40:13,175
I was disturbed.
I anticipated that at best...

1252
01:40:13,258 --> 01:40:16,428
he would be involved
in great difficulty.

1253
01:40:18,096 --> 01:40:19,848
No further questions.

1254
01:40:19,848 --> 01:40:21,517
No questions.

1255
01:40:22,976 --> 01:40:25,354
Does defense intend to recall
witness at a later time?

1256
01:40:25,354 --> 01:40:26,605
No, sir.

1257
01:40:28,106 --> 01:40:30,275
-No cross-examination?
-No, sir.

1258
01:40:31,026 --> 01:40:32,986
-Witness excused.
-He's lying!

1259
01:40:33,111 --> 01:40:35,614
Every time he opens his mouth
he gets you into more trouble.

1260
01:40:35,614 --> 01:40:38,826
Forget it. I want one hero,
not two mutineers.

1261
01:40:38,826 --> 01:40:43,413
Call Dr. Dix on, please.

1262
01:40:52,297 --> 01:40:56,051
-How'd it go?
-Ordeal. You know.

1263
01:40:56,051 --> 01:40:59,471
-You were on the hot seat yourself.
-I didn't know if I was coming or going.

1264
01:40:59,471 --> 01:41:01,890
But you're the word king.
You know what you were doing.

1265
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:03,433
Yeah.

1266
01:41:04,393 --> 01:41:06,478
I knew what I was doing.

1267
01:41:12,901 --> 01:41:15,320
May I ask you, as a psychiatrist...

1268
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:19,408
is it possible for a sane man
to perform offensive or foolish acts?

1269
01:41:19,408 --> 01:41:22,411
-It happens every day.
-Assuming for a moment--

1270
01:41:22,411 --> 01:41:24,288
This is a hypothetical question.

1271
01:41:24,288 --> 01:41:29,084
Assuming the captain's conduct was harsh
and often showed bad judgement...

1272
01:41:29,084 --> 01:41:32,421
would that be inconsistent
with your diagnosis of him?

1273
01:41:32,421 --> 01:41:38,343
No. My colleagues and I didn't find
Commander Queeg a perfect officer.

1274
01:41:38,343 --> 01:41:40,345
We found an absence of mental illness.

1275
01:41:40,345 --> 01:41:43,765
You still say the defendant
was unjustified in relieving him?

1276
01:41:43,765 --> 01:41:47,644
From a psychiatric standpoint,
completely unjustified.

1277
01:41:49,605 --> 01:41:50,981
Your witness.

1278
01:41:52,024 --> 01:41:54,526
My background is legal, not medical.

1279
01:41:54,526 --> 01:41:56,528
Forgive me
if I ask elementary questions.

1280
01:41:56,528 --> 01:41:58,280
That's all right.

1281
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:02,367
You've said previously that
Commander Queeg, like all adults...

1282
01:42:02,367 --> 01:42:04,328
had problems which he handled well.

1283
01:42:04,328 --> 01:42:05,787
What problems?

1284
01:42:05,787 --> 01:42:10,459
I object. Commander Oueeg
isn't on trial. Lieutenant Maryk is.

1285
01:42:10,459 --> 01:42:14,755
This constitutes irrelevant probing
of medical confidences.

1286
01:42:14,755 --> 01:42:16,423
I rely on the court's judgement.

1287
01:42:16,548 --> 01:42:20,886
Evidence regarding Queeg's mental makeup
is of utmost importance to my case.

1288
01:42:20,886 --> 01:42:24,056
Objection overruled.

1289
01:42:24,056 --> 01:42:26,975
The doctor may answer within
the limits of medical discretion.

1290
01:42:26,975 --> 01:42:28,310
Repeat the question.

1291
01:42:28,310 --> 01:42:32,397
"You've said previously that
Commander Queeg, like all adults...

1292
01:42:32,397 --> 01:42:34,650
had problems which he handled well.

1293
01:42:34,650 --> 01:42:37,402
What problems?"

1294
01:42:37,402 --> 01:42:40,614
The overall problem...

1295
01:42:40,614 --> 01:42:43,826
is one of inferiority, arising
from an unfavorable childhood...

1296
01:42:43,826 --> 01:42:45,744
and aggravated by adult experiences.

1297
01:42:45,744 --> 01:42:48,121
What were those adult experiences?

1298
01:42:48,121 --> 01:42:51,166
He'd undergone a lot of strain...

1299
01:42:51,166 --> 01:42:54,253
in long, arduous combat duty.

1300
01:42:54,253 --> 01:42:55,921
That's all I can say.

1301
01:42:55,921 --> 01:43:00,008
Sir, would he be inclined
to admit mistakes?

1302
01:43:00,008 --> 01:43:02,010
None of us are.

1303
01:43:03,011 --> 01:43:06,181
-Would he be a perfectionist?
-Yes.

1304
01:43:06,181 --> 01:43:10,519
Inclined to hound subordinates
about small details?

1305
01:43:10,519 --> 01:43:12,020
Yes.

1306
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:15,858
Would he be inclined to think
that people were hostile to him?

1307
01:43:15,858 --> 01:43:17,943
That's part of the picture, yes.

1308
01:43:17,943 --> 01:43:22,114
And if criticized, would he feel
he was being unjustly persecuted?

1309
01:43:22,114 --> 01:43:25,117
It's all one pattern
stemming from one premise.

1310
01:43:25,117 --> 01:43:26,910
He must try to be perfect.

1311
01:43:28,287 --> 01:43:32,749
You testified the following symptoms
exist in Commander Queeg's behavior :

1312
01:43:32,749 --> 01:43:35,377
rigidity of personality,
feelings of persecution...

1313
01:43:35,377 --> 01:43:37,629
unreasonable suspicion,
a mania for perfection...

1314
01:43:37,629 --> 01:43:40,549
and a neurotic certainty
that's he's always right.

1315
01:43:40,549 --> 01:43:44,553
Isn't there one psychiatric term
for this illness?

1316
01:43:45,554 --> 01:43:47,139
I never said there was illness!

1317
01:43:47,139 --> 01:43:49,975
Thank you for the correction, sir.

1318
01:43:49,975 --> 01:43:53,312
What would you call a personality
that had these symptoms?

1319
01:43:54,646 --> 01:43:58,317
A paranoid personality,
but that's not a disabling illness.

1320
01:43:59,234 --> 01:44:01,236
What kind of personality?

1321
01:44:03,071 --> 01:44:06,325
-Paranoid.
-Thank you, sir.

1322
01:44:06,325 --> 01:44:08,076
If I may speak.

1323
01:44:08,076 --> 01:44:11,121
I'd tike to protest the council's
twisting of words.

1324
01:44:11,121 --> 01:44:15,501
There's a difference between mental
illness and minor mental disturbances.

1325
01:44:15,501 --> 01:44:17,586
Let me put it this way :

1326
01:44:17,586 --> 01:44:20,589
Could Captain Queeg have been disabled
by the severe strain of command?

1327
01:44:20,589 --> 01:44:23,217
That's absurdly hypothetical.

1328
01:44:23,217 --> 01:44:25,511
Is it?

1329
01:44:25,511 --> 01:44:27,387
Have you ever had sea duty?

1330
01:44:28,847 --> 01:44:31,141
-No.
-Have you ever been at sea?

1331
01:44:31,141 --> 01:44:35,020
-No.
-How long have you been in the navy?

1332
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:36,271
Five months.

1333
01:44:36,271 --> 01:44:39,274
Have you had dealings with
ship captains before this?

1334
01:44:40,609 --> 01:44:44,279
I suggest you can't be an authority
on the strain of command...

1335
01:44:44,279 --> 01:44:46,990
and thus, you may be completely wrong
about Captain Queeg.

1336
01:44:50,869 --> 01:44:54,081
-Your witness.
-One minute, Doctor.

1337
01:44:54,081 --> 01:44:57,543
Council for defense
has raised an interesting point.

1338
01:44:57,543 --> 01:45:00,045
In private practice,
did you ever have patients...

1339
01:45:00,045 --> 01:45:03,799
who had to deal
with complicated command decisions--

1340
01:45:03,799 --> 01:45:07,136
men such as plant managers,
industrialists, et cetera?

1341
01:45:07,136 --> 01:45:08,887
Yes. Quite a few.

1342
01:45:08,971 --> 01:45:12,724
Including flyers who have to decide
questions of life and death every day.

1343
01:45:12,724 --> 01:45:16,061
I've written a book on the subject.

1344
01:45:16,061 --> 01:45:18,897
In those cases,
oould you detect where a neurosis...

1345
01:45:18,897 --> 01:45:22,734
might damage the ability
to make decisions at the right time?

1346
01:45:22,734 --> 01:45:24,111
Ahsolutely.

1347
01:45:24,111 --> 01:45:27,030
And in your examination
of Commander Queeg...

1348
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:29,116
you found no such damage, right?

1349
01:45:29,116 --> 01:45:30,784
Absolutely right.

1350
01:45:32,035 --> 01:45:34,955
Thank you, Doctor.
That'll be all.

1351
01:45:36,331 --> 01:45:40,085
-Smart guy.
-He's sure gonna hear down on me.

1352
01:45:43,589 --> 01:45:47,589
And that's the way I saw it.

1353
01:45:43,589 --> 01:45:45,507
And that's the way I saw it.

1354
01:45:45,507 --> 01:45:48,510
I felt it was my duty
as a naval officer.

1355
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:51,430
Captain Oueeg was sick--mentally ill--

1356
01:45:51,430 --> 01:45:53,724
and I had to take over.

1357
01:45:53,724 --> 01:45:57,186
And honestly, if I had to do it again,
I'd do it.

1358
01:45:57,186 --> 01:46:00,939
Thank you, Mr. Maryk.
Your witness, sir.

1359
01:46:00,939 --> 01:46:03,942
Mr. Maryk, just a few questions.

1360
01:46:03,942 --> 01:46:07,196
Would you say your grades in high school
were average?

1361
01:46:09,865 --> 01:46:11,450
Lower than average.

1362
01:46:11,450 --> 01:46:15,287
-And in college?
-Lower than average.

1363
01:46:15,287 --> 01:46:18,123
What training have you had
in psychiatry or medicine?

1364
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:20,125
None.

1365
01:46:20,209 --> 01:46:24,379
Where did you get the idea
that Captain Queeg was mentally if I?

1366
01:46:24,379 --> 01:46:26,673
-Out of books.
-What books? Name the titles.

1367
01:46:27,716 --> 01:46:29,468
I can't remember.

1368
01:46:29,468 --> 01:46:31,386
Define schizophrenia.

1369
01:46:31,386 --> 01:46:33,347
I can't.

1370
01:46:33,347 --> 01:46:36,475
-What is a manic depressive?
-I don't know.

1371
01:46:36,558 --> 01:46:39,603
What's the difference between
the words paranoid and paranoia?

1372
01:46:39,603 --> 01:46:41,063
I don't know.

1373
01:46:41,063 --> 01:46:44,399
You don't know what you're talking about
when you discuss mental illness.

1374
01:46:45,984 --> 01:46:47,653
f didn't say I knew much ahout it.

1375
01:46:47,653 --> 01:46:51,073
You thought you knew enough to commit
an act that was outright mutiny.

1376
01:46:51,073 --> 01:46:53,784
I wanted to save the ship.

1377
01:46:53,784 --> 01:46:58,664
But responsible doctors found that
the captain wasn't mentally ill, right?

1378
01:46:59,206 --> 01:47:00,749
They weren't there.

1379
01:47:00,874 --> 01:47:03,377
Isn't the reverse possible?

1380
01:47:03,377 --> 01:47:06,004
Isn't it possible that under pressure
you became erratic...

1381
01:47:06,004 --> 01:47:09,216
and couldn't understand
the captain's sound decision?

1382
01:47:09,216 --> 01:47:12,261
-It's possible--
-Between a captain and his officer...

1383
01:47:12,261 --> 01:47:15,681
who is presumed by the navy to have
better judgement in ship handing?

1384
01:47:16,598 --> 01:47:19,434
-The captain.
-One last question.

1385
01:47:19,518 --> 01:47:22,437
If the diagnosis of expert doctors
is correct...

1386
01:47:22,437 --> 01:47:25,357
then you're guilty as charged,
aren't you?

1387
01:47:27,776 --> 01:47:29,027
Maybe so.

1388
01:47:34,366 --> 01:47:35,909
No more questions.

1389
01:47:35,909 --> 01:47:37,870
No further questions.

1390
01:47:37,870 --> 01:47:39,872
You may step down.

1391
01:47:49,798 --> 01:47:52,176
Take it easy.
You've just seen the first act.

1392
01:47:52,176 --> 01:47:54,136
The finale's still to come.

1393
01:48:03,312 --> 01:48:05,731
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

1394
01:48:11,069 --> 01:48:16,492
I assumed command of an extremely
sloppy, badly handled ship.

1395
01:48:16,492 --> 01:48:18,744
I was determined to bring
this ship in line.

1396
01:48:18,744 --> 01:48:22,080
Lieutenant Maryk opposed me
from the very first.

1397
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:25,125
Maybe he thought I was crazy
to keep trying.

1398
01:48:25,125 --> 01:48:29,087
In your judgement, was your ship
on the verge of foundering...

1399
01:48:29,087 --> 01:48:32,341
when the executive officer
assumed command?

1400
01:48:32,341 --> 01:48:34,426
Well, as you know...

1401
01:48:34,426 --> 01:48:36,678
a typhoon is an extreme hazard
at all times.

1402
01:48:36,678 --> 01:48:38,680
But the ship was riding well.

1403
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:41,683
Lieutenant Maryk went into a panic
and ran amuck.

1404
01:48:41,683 --> 01:48:45,979
He acted under the delusion
that he alone could save the ship.

1405
01:48:45,979 --> 01:48:50,359
Ensign Keith--an unreliable
and disloyal officer--

1406
01:48:50,359 --> 01:48:53,487
combined with him against me
at this crucial time.

1407
01:48:53,487 --> 01:48:55,781
It was bad luck for them, really.

1408
01:48:55,781 --> 01:48:59,451
I bear them no malice.
I'm extremely sorry for them.

1409
01:48:59,451 --> 01:49:02,120
No more questions.

1410
01:49:02,120 --> 01:49:05,457
A word of caution before you proceed
with the examination.

1411
01:49:05,457 --> 01:49:09,211
The court recognizes that the defense
is compelled to challenge...

1412
01:49:09,211 --> 01:49:11,296
the competence
of Lieutenant Commander Oueeg.

1413
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:13,507
Nevertheless,
the requirements of legal ethics...

1414
01:49:13,632 --> 01:49:15,884
and military respect
remain in force.

1415
01:49:15,884 --> 01:49:17,803
Thank you.

1416
01:49:17,803 --> 01:49:22,141
Mr. Queeg, during a period
when the Caine was towing targets...

1417
01:49:22,141 --> 01:49:25,394
did you ever steam over
your own towline and out it?

1418
01:49:25,394 --> 01:49:27,563
Objection. I beg the court's indulgence.

1419
01:49:27,563 --> 01:49:30,732
The defense outrages the dignity
of this proceeding.

1420
01:49:30,732 --> 01:49:34,153
The judge advocate wants the defense
to switch to a guilty plea.

1421
01:49:34,153 --> 01:49:36,738
He thinks the report of the psychiatrist
closes the case.

1422
01:49:36,738 --> 01:49:40,325
But it is up to you line naval officers,
not doctors...

1423
01:49:40,325 --> 01:49:42,286
to judge the captain's performance
of duty.

1424
01:49:42,286 --> 01:49:45,831
I must review that performance
for the navy to render a judgement.

1425
01:49:45,831 --> 01:49:47,916
Objection overruled.

1426
01:49:47,916 --> 01:49:51,879
Now, sir. Did you ever steam over
your own towline and out it?

1427
01:49:51,879 --> 01:49:57,092
Well, f for one am happy to dispose
of this particular slander.

1428
01:49:57,092 --> 01:50:01,763
While we were towing the target,
I noticed antiaircraft bursts close.

1429
01:50:01,763 --> 01:50:04,266
Naturally, I turned to avoid them.

1430
01:50:04,266 --> 01:50:06,477
And you continued to turn
in a full circle.

1431
01:50:06,602 --> 01:50:11,482
My unreliable helmsman failed to warn me
we were coming around 360 degrees.

1432
01:50:11,482 --> 01:50:15,027
I caught it in time
and instantly reversed course.

1433
01:50:15,027 --> 01:50:18,155
To the best of my knowledge,
we didn't steam over the towline.

1434
01:50:18,155 --> 01:50:20,032
I see.

1435
01:50:20,032 --> 01:50:24,119
Besides the antiaircraft bursts,
did nothing else distract you?

1436
01:50:24,119 --> 01:50:25,787
Not that I recall.

1437
01:50:25,787 --> 01:50:31,210
Weren't you engaged in reprimanding
a seaman named Dlugatch, at length...

1438
01:50:31,210 --> 01:50:35,881
for caving his shirttail out,
while the ship turned 360 degrees?

1439
01:50:35,881 --> 01:50:39,134
I reprimanded him,
but that only took two seconds.

1440
01:50:41,094 --> 01:50:44,973
When the Caine escorted attack boats
of marines to the beach...

1441
01:50:44,973 --> 01:50:47,768
did your orders include
dropping a yellow dye-marker?

1442
01:50:49,561 --> 01:50:51,647
I don't recall.

1443
01:50:51,647 --> 01:50:53,398
Did you drop one?

1444
01:50:54,650 --> 01:50:56,735
I don't recall.

1445
01:50:56,735 --> 01:51:00,697
Didn't you steam several hundred yards
ahead of the attack boats...

1446
01:51:00,697 --> 01:51:04,159
drop a dye-marker
and retire at high speed...

1447
01:51:04,159 --> 01:51:06,119
leaving the boats to make the beach
on their own?

1448
01:51:06,119 --> 01:51:08,330
The question is abusive
and flagrantly leading.

1449
01:51:08,413 --> 01:51:13,085
There oan be no more serious a charge
to an officer than cowardice under fire.

1450
01:51:14,044 --> 01:51:17,089
May I make one thing clear?

1451
01:51:17,089 --> 01:51:20,717
It is not the defense's contention
that Commander Queeg is a coward.

1452
01:51:20,717 --> 01:51:22,511
Quite the contrary.

1453
01:51:22,511 --> 01:51:28,225
The defense assumes no man who rises
to command a naval ship can he a coward.

1454
01:51:28,225 --> 01:51:32,271
And therefore, if he commits
questionable acts under fire...

1455
01:51:32,271 --> 01:51:34,356
the explanation must he elsewhere.

1456
01:51:34,356 --> 01:51:36,275
You may resume.

1457
01:51:37,401 --> 01:51:40,445
You seem to be the victim
of constantly disloyal officers.

1458
01:51:40,445 --> 01:51:44,283
Now, I didn't say that!
Only some of them were disloyal.

1459
01:51:44,283 --> 01:51:46,994
-Mr. Keith and Mr. Maryk, for instance?
-Yes.

1460
01:51:46,994 --> 01:51:51,039
Mr. Queeg, this is a fitness report
you wrote on Mr. Maryk.

1461
01:51:51,039 --> 01:51:54,918
July 1, 1944, one month
before he relieved you.

1462
01:51:54,918 --> 01:51:56,378
Do you recognize it?

1463
01:51:59,798 --> 01:52:01,049
I do.

1464
01:52:01,049 --> 01:52:04,094
Would you mind reading your comments
on Mr. Maryk?

1465
01:52:05,762 --> 01:52:07,973
I don't believe the court can hear you.

1466
01:52:10,476 --> 01:52:14,938
"This officer's improved
since his last report.

1467
01:52:14,938 --> 01:52:18,400
He's consistently loyal, courageous,
thorough and efficient.

1468
01:52:18,400 --> 01:52:21,820
He's recommended for transfer to the
regular navy." I'd like to say that--

1469
01:52:21,820 --> 01:52:23,572
Thank you.

1470
01:52:23,572 --> 01:52:27,993
Did you ever turn your ship upside-down
in search of a key that didn't exist?

1471
01:52:28,911 --> 01:52:31,622
I don't know what lies have been
sworn to in this court.

1472
01:52:31,622 --> 01:52:35,375
I'd like to set you straight
here and now! A key did exist!

1473
01:52:35,375 --> 01:52:38,837
The witness is understandably agitated
by this ordeal.

1474
01:52:38,837 --> 01:52:42,174
-I request a recess to give him--
-I don't want a recess!

1475
01:52:42,174 --> 01:52:44,259
I'll answer all questions
right here and now.

1476
01:52:44,259 --> 01:52:47,763
-Did you conduct such a sear oh?
-Yes, I did.

1477
01:52:47,763 --> 01:52:52,184
As usual, my disloyal officers failed
me, and the key couldn't be found.

1478
01:52:52,184 --> 01:52:56,230
In fact, wasn't this whole fuss
over a quart of strawberries?

1479
01:52:56,230 --> 01:52:59,024
Pilfering food,
in large amounts or small...

1480
01:52:59,024 --> 01:53:02,277
is one of the most serious
occurrences on board ship.

1481
01:53:02,277 --> 01:53:04,571
Didn't you learn the mess boys
ate the strawberries...

1482
01:53:04,571 --> 01:53:06,657
and your search
was for an imaginary key?

1483
01:53:06,657 --> 01:53:10,202
I repeat! The key was not imaginary!

1484
01:53:10,202 --> 01:53:13,872
And I don't know anything
about mess boys eating strawberries.

1485
01:53:13,872 --> 01:53:17,209
Have you no recollection of
a conversation with Ensign Harding...

1486
01:53:17,209 --> 01:53:20,295
just prior to his leaving the Caine?

1487
01:53:20,295 --> 01:53:23,757
-What ahout it?
-Didn't he tell you they ate them?

1488
01:53:25,134 --> 01:53:29,388
All that f remember is that he was
very grateful for his transfer.

1489
01:53:29,388 --> 01:53:31,557
His wife was ill in the states.

1490
01:53:31,682 --> 01:53:33,475
Do you know where Ensign Harding
is now?

1491
01:53:33,475 --> 01:53:35,644
I have no way of knowing.

1492
01:53:35,727 --> 01:53:38,647
Ensign Harding is in San Diego.
His wife has fully recovered.

1493
01:53:38,647 --> 01:53:42,818
He's been summoned and can be flown
up here in three hours, if necessary.

1494
01:53:42,818 --> 01:53:45,320
Would it serve any useful purpose
to have him testify?

1495
01:53:46,155 --> 01:53:48,991
No, l--

1496
01:53:50,576 --> 01:53:53,495
I don't see any need of that.

1497
01:53:55,038 --> 01:53:57,541
Now that I recall--

1498
01:53:57,541 --> 01:54:00,669
he might have said something
about mess boys, and he might not.

1499
01:54:00,669 --> 01:54:05,257
I questioned so many men, and Harding
was not the most reliable officer.

1500
01:54:05,257 --> 01:54:10,679
I'm afraid the defense has no other
recourse than to produce Ensign Harding.

1501
01:54:10,679 --> 01:54:12,431
There's no need for that!

1502
01:54:12,431 --> 01:54:14,433
He'll just tell you lies!

1503
01:54:14,433 --> 01:54:17,853
He was no different from any officer
in the wardroom. They were all disloyal!

1504
01:54:17,853 --> 01:54:21,106
I tried to run the ship hy the book,
but they fought me at every turn.

1505
01:54:21,106 --> 01:54:25,194
If the crew wanted to walk around
with shirttails hanging out, let them!

1506
01:54:25,194 --> 01:54:28,113
Take the towline--
defective equipment, no more, no less.

1507
01:54:28,113 --> 01:54:32,451
But they encouraged the crew to go
around spreading wild rumors...

1508
01:54:32,451 --> 01:54:36,121
about steaming in circles
and then "Old Yellowstain."

1509
01:54:36,121 --> 01:54:40,083
I was to blame for Lieutenant Maryk's
incompetence and poor seamanship.

1510
01:54:40,083 --> 01:54:43,712
Lieutenant Maryk was the perfect
officer, but not Captain Oueeg.

1511
01:54:43,712 --> 01:54:46,632
But the strawberries!
That's where I had them.

1512
01:54:46,632 --> 01:54:48,425
They laughed at me and made jokes.

1513
01:54:48,425 --> 01:54:53,222
But I proved beyond a shadow of a doubt
and with geometric logic...

1514
01:54:53,222 --> 01:54:55,307
that a duplicate key
to the icebox did exist.

1515
01:54:55,307 --> 01:54:58,310
I'd have produced that key if they
hadn't pulled the Caine out of action!

1516
01:54:58,310 --> 01:55:02,397
I know now they were only trying
to protect some fellow officer--

1517
01:55:14,993 --> 01:55:20,415
Naturally, I can only cover these things
from memory.

1518
01:55:21,083 --> 01:55:24,294
If I've left anything out...

1519
01:55:24,294 --> 01:55:27,756
just ask me specific questions...

1520
01:55:27,756 --> 01:55:30,759
and I'll be glad to answer them...

1521
01:55:30,759 --> 01:55:32,845
one by one.

1522
01:55:55,701 --> 01:55:58,203
No further questions, sir.

1523
01:56:01,540 --> 01:56:03,792
The court is closed.

1524
01:56:05,377 --> 01:56:08,714
For he's a jolly good fellow

1525
01:56:15,304 --> 01:56:17,681
That nobody oan deny

1526
01:56:19,349 --> 01:56:21,310
No, baby. There are no girls here.

1527
01:56:21,310 --> 01:56:24,480
Just the officers of the Caine.

1528
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:26,440
What, darling?

1529
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:28,525
Steve, make 'em pipe down, will you?

1530
01:56:28,525 --> 01:56:32,571
Knock it off, fellows!
Old Willie's talking to his girl.

1531
01:56:32,571 --> 01:56:36,325
-Hi, Tom!
-Hello, Rabbit. How are you?

1532
01:56:36,325 --> 01:56:38,243
Hello, Jim.

1533
01:56:39,578 --> 01:56:41,747
Hello, Tom.

1534
01:56:41,747 --> 01:56:45,334
I didn't think you'd have the guts
to come around.

1535
01:56:45,334 --> 01:56:48,003
I didn't have the guts not to.

1536
01:56:59,389 --> 01:57:03,769
I wanna thank you for not telling
the fellows ahout what happened.

1537
01:57:03,769 --> 01:57:05,646
I'm delighted at how things turned out.

1538
01:57:05,646 --> 01:57:08,774
Stow it. It's over and done with.

1539
01:57:08,774 --> 01:57:10,108
Yeah.

1540
01:57:10,108 --> 01:57:12,110
You can take a plane tonight.

1541
01:57:12,194 --> 01:57:16,365
I'm getting a new ship and skipper,
but we'll have time to get married!

1542
01:57:16,365 --> 01:57:18,575
We'll let my mother know afterwards.

1543
01:57:18,575 --> 01:57:20,244
Please, May.

1544
01:57:21,703 --> 01:57:24,206
I love you, darling!

1545
01:57:25,541 --> 01:57:27,543
Good-bye, sweetheart.

1546
01:57:28,877 --> 01:57:30,796
Steve, Tom! That was May.

1547
01:57:30,796 --> 01:57:32,214
We're--

1548
01:57:34,633 --> 01:57:37,219
Well, well!

1549
01:57:37,219 --> 01:57:41,306
The officers of the Caine
in happy celebration.

1550
01:57:41,306 --> 01:57:43,809
What are you, Barney? Kind of tight?

1551
01:57:43,809 --> 01:57:47,479
Sure. I got a guilty conscience.

1552
01:57:48,897 --> 01:57:52,651
I defended you, Steve, because
I found the wrong man was on trial.

1553
01:57:52,651 --> 01:57:55,279
So I torpedoed Queeg for you.

1554
01:57:55,279 --> 01:57:57,656
I had to torpedo him.

1555
01:57:57,656 --> 01:57:59,658
And I feel sick about it.

1556
01:57:59,741 --> 01:58:01,827
Okay, take it easy.

1557
01:58:03,328 --> 01:58:07,166
You know, when I was studying law...

1558
01:58:07,166 --> 01:58:10,085
and Mr. Keefer was
writing his stories...

1559
01:58:10,085 --> 01:58:14,756
and you, Willie, were tearing up
the playing fields of Princeton...

1560
01:58:14,756 --> 01:58:18,844
who was standing guard over this
fat, dumb, happy country of ours?

1561
01:58:18,844 --> 01:58:23,640
Not us. Oh, no! We knew you couldn't
make any money in the service.

1562
01:58:23,640 --> 01:58:26,977
So who did the dirty work for us?
Queeg did!

1563
01:58:26,977 --> 01:58:31,773
And other guys--tough, sharp guys
who didn't crack up like Queeg.

1564
01:58:31,773 --> 01:58:35,444
No matter what, he endangered the ship
and the lives of the men.

1565
01:58:35,444 --> 01:58:39,198
He didn't endanger anybody!
You did! All of you!

1566
01:58:39,198 --> 01:58:41,283
You"re a fine bunch of officers.

1567
01:58:41,283 --> 01:58:43,035
You said your self he cracked.

1568
01:58:43,035 --> 01:58:47,289
I'm glad you brought that up,
because that's a very pretty point.

1569
01:58:47,289 --> 01:58:49,917
I left out one detail
in the court-martial.

1570
01:58:49,917 --> 01:58:52,294
It wouldn't have helped our case any.

1571
01:58:52,294 --> 01:58:54,922
After the Yellowstain business,
Queeg asked for help...

1572
01:58:54,922 --> 01:58:57,007
and you turned him down,
didn't you?

1573
01:58:58,801 --> 01:58:59,927
Yes.

1574
01:59:00,969 --> 01:59:05,349
You didn't approve of his conduct.
He wasn't worthy of your loyalty.

1575
01:59:05,349 --> 01:59:09,520
So you turned on him. You ragged him.
You made up songs about him.

1576
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:12,022
If you'd given Queeg
the loyalty he needed...

1577
01:59:12,022 --> 01:59:14,650
would the whole issue
have come up in the typhoon?

1578
01:59:14,650 --> 01:59:17,236
You're an honest man, Steve.
I'm asking you.

1579
01:59:17,236 --> 01:59:19,404
Would it have been necessary
for you to take over?

1580
01:59:21,615 --> 01:59:24,743
ft probably wouldn't
have been necessary.

1581
01:59:24,743 --> 01:59:26,745
If that's true, then we were guilty.

1582
01:59:26,745 --> 01:59:29,122
You're learning, Willie!

1583
01:59:29,122 --> 01:59:32,876
You don't work with a captain because
you like the way he parts his hair.

1584
01:59:32,876 --> 01:59:38,423
You work with him because
he's got the job or you're no good!

1585
01:59:38,423 --> 01:59:42,886
Well, the case is over.
You're all safe.

1586
01:59:42,886 --> 01:59:45,389
It was like shooting fish in a barrel.

1587
01:59:48,934 --> 01:59:51,937
Now we come to the man
who should have stood trial.

1588
01:59:51,937 --> 01:59:54,273
The Caine's favorite author.

1589
01:59:54,273 --> 01:59:56,942
The Shakespeare who's testimony
nearly sunk us all.

1590
01:59:58,110 --> 02:00:03,615
-Tell 'em, Keefer.
-You go ahead. You're telling it better.

1591
02:00:04,575 --> 02:00:08,954
You ought to read his testimony.
He never even heard of Captain Queeg!

1592
02:00:08,954 --> 02:00:10,289
Forget it.

1593
02:00:10,414 --> 02:00:12,791
Queeg was sick.
He couldn't help himself.

1594
02:00:12,916 --> 02:00:15,627
But you--you're real healthy.

1595
02:00:15,627 --> 02:00:18,046
Only you didn't have one-tenth
the guts he had.

1596
02:00:19,590 --> 02:00:22,092
Except, I never fooled myself.

1597
02:00:22,217 --> 02:00:25,721
I'm going to drink a toast to you,
Mr. Keefer.

1598
02:00:25,721 --> 02:00:27,931
From the beginning,
you hated the navy...

1599
02:00:27,931 --> 02:00:30,434
and then you thought of this
whole idea.

1600
02:00:30,434 --> 02:00:35,439
You managed to keep your skirts starched
and clean, even in the court-martial.

1601
02:00:35,439 --> 02:00:38,066
Maryk will always be remembered
as a mutineer.

1602
02:00:38,066 --> 02:00:42,946
But you'll publish your novel.
You'll make a million bucks.

1603
02:00:42,946 --> 02:00:45,324
You'll marry a big movie star.

1604
02:00:45,324 --> 02:00:47,743
And for the rest of your life
you'll five with your conscience.

1605
02:00:47,743 --> 02:00:49,828
If you have any.

1606
02:00:50,871 --> 02:00:55,751
Here's to the real author
of the Caine mutiny.

1607
02:00:55,751 --> 02:00:57,753
Here's to you, Mr. Keefer.

1608
02:01:01,924 --> 02:01:05,177
If you wanna do anything about it,
I'll be outside.

1609
02:01:05,177 --> 02:01:09,932
I'm a lot drunker than you are,
so it'll be a fair fight.

1610
02:02:14,288 --> 02:02:16,373
-Good-bye, darling.
-Good-bye, Willie.

1611
02:02:39,438 --> 02:02:41,398
Attention on deck!

1612
02:03:02,252 --> 02:03:05,047
-Keith?
-Yes, sir?

1613
02:03:06,840 --> 02:03:08,217
Take her out.

1614
02:03:10,052 --> 02:03:11,637
Aye, aye, sir.

1615
02:03:16,642 --> 02:03:18,393
Single up all lines!

1616
02:03:21,146 --> 02:03:23,398
Stand by to cast off.
