Did you?

It's been a right busy day.

You must be kind of
tuckered out.

386
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:49,668
Well, a hired girl's got a right
to her own sleeping place.

Besides, if I'd have
told you beforehand,

394
00:24:08,334 --> 00:24:10,402
you might not have married me.

395
00:24:10,434 --> 00:24:12,802
I wanted you
to marry me real bad.

Sure you did,

397
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:16,269
because you knew
I was young and strong

398

lots of work in me.

00:47:54,933 --> 00:47:57,460
Adam, we could
use her on the farm.

719
00:47:57,499 --> 00:48:00,097
How about it, boys?

720
00:48:00,132 --> 00:48:04,498
Mr. Perkins, put the 7 of us
brothers down for one team.

721
00:48:04,532 --> 00:48:06,760
Milly says she's taken
a fancy to Annabel.

722
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,768
You hear, boys?
That was Adam Pontipee.

723
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,297
Last time he came to town he
bragged he always got

724
00:48:11,332 --> 00:48:13,001
what he set out to get.

725

I'm warning you.

We'll handle him.

729

had my hand there.

What happened?

743
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,258
Nothing.

00:49:20,967 --> 00:49:23,294

01:13:39,265 --> 01:13:40,604
What have you done?

1078
01:13:40,631 --> 01:13:42,359
Oh, milly, help us.

1079
01:13:42,398 --> 01:13:43,667
Milly, we've been kidnapped.

1080
01:13:43,698 --> 01:13:45,366
Oh, milly.

1081
01:13:45,398 --> 01:13:47,596
Take these girls back at once.

1082
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:49,359
We can't. There was
an avalanche.

1083
01:13:49,398 --> 01:13:51,606
They'll have to wait
till spring.

1084
01:13:51,631 --> 01:13:53,999
It was your idea, wasn't it?

1085
01:13:54,031 --> 01:13:55,999
I'd say it was more yours.

1086
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:58,798
It came out of that book
about them sobbin' women.

1087
01:13:58,831 --> 01:14:00,799
What kind of men are you?

1088
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:02,399
Are you animals?

1089
01:14:02,431 --> 01:14:03,800
Swooping down like hawks,

1090
01:14:03,831 --> 01:14:05,369
carrying off poor innocents.

1091
01:14:05,398 --> 01:14:07,766
They're just young boys in love.

1092
01:14:07,798 --> 01:14:09,766
Didn't you tell me today

1093
01:14:09,798 --> 01:14:11,706
you wanted them all married?

1094
01:14:11,731 --> 01:14:14,298
I want my mother.

1095
01:14:14,331 --> 01:14:15,630
Please don't cry, Alice.

1096
01:14:15,665 --> 01:14:17,263
I'm sorry, honest.

1097
01:14:17,265 --> 01:14:19,933
It was the only way I could
get to marry you. Adam!

1098
01:14:19,965 --> 01:14:22,233
We forgot to get the parson!

1099
01:14:22,265 --> 01:14:23,893
Don't worry, now.

1100
01:14:23,931 --> 01:14:25,100
Go on in the kitchen.

1101
01:14:25,131 --> 01:14:26,230
Nothing's gonna happen.

1102
01:14:26,265 --> 01:14:28,133
Cheer up. You got 'em,
haven't you?

1103
01:14:28,165 --> 01:14:29,863
Everything will be
all right. Milly.

1104
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:32,266
This house is for the girls.

1105
01:14:32,298 --> 01:14:34,266
You won't set foot in it

1106
01:14:34,298 --> 01:14:36,196
as long as they're here.

1107
01:14:36,231 --> 01:14:39,258
You'll eat and sleep in the barn
with the rest of the livestock.

1108
01:14:39,298 --> 01:14:41,266
Now get out of here.

1109
01:14:41,298 --> 01:14:43,765
I'm ashamed of you.

1110
01:14:43,798 --> 01:14:45,197
Go ahead, boys, go on.

1111
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:47,858
You, too.

1112
01:14:47,898 --> 01:14:49,856
You're taking this too hard.

1113
01:14:49,898 --> 01:14:51,866
Everything will work out fine.

1114
01:14:51,898 --> 01:14:54,126
We'll get a parson up here.

1115
01:14:54,165 --> 01:14:56,133
Do you think those girls

1116
01:14:56,165 --> 01:14:57,963
would marry them now?

1117
01:14:57,998 --> 01:15:00,755
You think because you
got a wife so easily,

1118
01:15:00,765 --> 01:15:02,763
'cause I didn't make
you court me,

1119
01:15:02,765 --> 01:15:05,762
that that's all there is to it?

1120
01:15:05,765 --> 01:15:08,762
I said yes because
I fell in love

1121
01:15:08,765 --> 01:15:10,873
the first time I saw you.

1122
01:15:10,898 --> 01:15:13,496
I thought it was the same with you.
Milly...

1123
01:15:13,530 --> 01:15:15,239
Think a wife's just to
cook and clean.

1124
01:15:15,265 --> 01:15:17,003
You got no understandings.

1125
01:15:17,031 --> 01:15:18,999
You got no feelings.

1126
01:15:19,031 --> 01:15:21,998
How could you do
a thing like this?

1127
01:15:22,031 --> 01:15:25,993
When I think of these girls
sick with fright

1128
01:15:26,031 --> 01:15:28,299
and their families
crazed with worry,

1129
01:15:28,331 --> 01:15:31,128
oh, I can't abide
to look at you.

1130
01:15:31,165 --> 01:15:33,962
[Door slams]

1131
01:15:41,998 --> 01:15:43,966
This isn't where we'd planned

1132
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:48,897
on spending the night...
In a barn.

1133
01:15:48,931 --> 01:15:50,469
What do you think you're doing?

1134
01:15:50,497 --> 01:15:52,126
I'm getting out of here.

1135
01:15:52,165 --> 01:15:54,892
Going to the trapping cabin
for the winter.

1136
01:15:54,931 --> 01:15:56,459
You can't, Adam.

1137
01:15:56,497 --> 01:15:58,056
You can't stay up there alone.

1138
01:15:58,098 --> 01:16:00,465
The cabin's got enough
supplies for six months.

1139
01:16:00,497 --> 01:16:03,464
Don't go. It's us she's mad at.

1140
01:16:03,497 --> 01:16:06,035
Nah. Nah, it's more than that.

1141
01:16:06,065 --> 01:16:08,902
It's something
that goes a lot deeper.

1142
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:11,866
Suppose you get sick
or break a leg,

1143
01:16:11,898 --> 01:16:13,167
up there alone?

1144
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:15,066
The wolves are bad this year.

1145
01:16:15,098 --> 01:16:21,172
The wolves are like good company
after what I've been through.

1146

[Crying]

1147
01:16:26,265 --> 01:16:28,772
There's nothing like
a nice hot cup of tea

1148

[Knock on door]

1150
01:16:32,198 --> 01:16:35,165
It's Gideon.
I got to speak to you.

1151
01:16:35,198 --> 01:16:36,766
No, milly! Don't!

1152
01:16:37,798 --> 01:16:40,764
Shh!
What is it?

1153
01:16:40,765 --> 01:16:43,293
It's about Adam. He's going away
up to the mountains,

1154
01:16:43,331 --> 01:16:45,998
up to the trapping cabin.

1155
01:16:46,031 --> 01:16:49,033
Can you hear me?
I hear.

1156
01:16:49,065 --> 01:16:51,203
Just ask him not to go.

1157
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:54,767
Please, milly.

1158
01:16:55,298 --> 01:16:58,635
He's gotta learn that he can't
treat people this way.

1159
01:17:20,665 --> 01:17:22,763
Now, eph, let's start here.

1160

Ow!

1165
01:18:01,798 --> 01:18:06,792
What's the matter,
afraid of a little snowball?

1166
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:13,268
Snowballs with rocks in them!

1167

01:36:18,963 --> 01:36:23,269
Oh, Adam...
Adam, you will be careful?

1426
01:36:31,329 --> 01:36:33,267
We're not letting you
you take 'em back, Adam.

1427
01:36:33,296 --> 01:36:36,293
We talked it over amongst us
and we're all agreed.

1428
01:36:36,329 --> 01:36:39,356
They ain't going.
They're our girls now.

1429
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:46,465
I say I'm taking 'em back.
I'm still head of this family.

1430
01:36:46,496 --> 01:36:48,504
Then I reckon
you'll have to show me.

1431
01:36:48,529 --> 01:36:50,467
Likewise.

1432
01:36:52,529 --> 01:36:54,197
What do I have to do,

1433
01:36:54,229 --> 01:36:56,158
beat some sense
into your dumb heads?

1434
01:36:56,196 --> 01:36:58,234
Don't you know taking 'em
back's the only way

1435
01:36:58,263 --> 01:37:00,581
you're ever gonna get 'em?
The whole town's coming up here.

1436
01:37:00,605 --> 01:37:04,789
Let 'em come.
We'll fight 'em all.

1437
01:37:04,830 --> 01:37:06,998
Sure you will.

1438
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:08,258
And who will you be fighting?

1439
01:37:08,796 --> 01:37:10,525
The girls' kinfolk.

1440
01:37:10,564 --> 01:37:13,591
Someone's bound to get hurt.
A father, a brother maybe.

1441
01:37:15,464 --> 01:37:19,260
Think the girls gonna
marry you after that?

1442
01:37:23,497 --> 01:37:25,664
Adam's right.

1443
01:37:25,696 --> 01:37:28,404
I stand with Adam.

1444
01:37:28,430 --> 01:37:31,367
Well, don't stand too close.

1445
01:37:31,397 --> 01:37:32,995
Adam. Adam, the girls have gone.

1446
01:37:33,029 --> 01:37:34,697
They've run away!

1447
01:37:34,729 --> 01:37:35,888
Go get them. Get them back.

1448
01:37:35,929 --> 01:37:36,898
Go on! Go on!

1449
01:37:36,929 --> 01:37:37,898
Come back here!

1450
01:37:37,929 --> 01:37:40,367
[Crosstalk]

1451
01:37:40,397 --> 01:37:41,695
Hiyah!

1452
01:37:41,729 --> 01:37:43,637
[Whistles]

1453
01:37:44,996 --> 01:37:47,803
Dorcas, come back.
You'll get hurt.

1454
01:37:50,430 --> 01:37:52,997
Let's keep it quiet.
They can hear us from here.

1455
01:37:53,029 --> 01:37:55,267
We'll creep up on 'em.

1456
01:37:56,497 --> 01:37:58,355
Alice! Please, Alice!

1457
01:37:58,397 --> 01:37:59,625
Daniel: Martha, where are you?

1458
01:37:59,663 --> 01:38:02,461
Come back, Martha.
Don't run away.

1459
01:38:02,497 --> 01:38:04,435
[Alice yells]

1460
01:38:04,464 --> 01:38:07,001
I'm not going back!
I'm not going back!

1461
01:38:07,029 --> 01:38:08,258
I want to stay here with you!

1462
01:38:08,264 --> 01:38:09,932
You've got to.
It's the only way.

1463
01:38:09,963 --> 01:38:12,760
Whoa! Whoa!

1464
01:38:12,796 --> 01:38:14,365
It's Alice!

1465
01:38:14,397 --> 01:38:17,434
Come on, Ruth.

1466
01:38:18,963 --> 01:38:21,900
Aah! Aah!

1467
01:38:21,929 --> 01:38:24,397
[Women screaming]

1468
01:38:24,430 --> 01:38:26,797
Hey, there they are!

1469
01:38:27,996 --> 01:38:30,264
Aah! Aah!

1470
01:38:32,763 --> 01:38:34,791
Stop! Let me go!

1471
01:38:37,929 --> 01:38:40,527
No! No! No!

1472
01:38:40,564 --> 01:38:43,590
Don't! You'll hit dorcas.

1473
01:38:47,963 --> 01:38:51,270
[Hannah crying]

1474
01:38:53,563 --> 01:38:58,257
Oh, no... Not that!

1475
01:38:59,829 --> 01:39:02,866
[Hollering, yelling]

1476
01:39:09,430 --> 01:39:11,468
Grab her dress, Ben!

1477
01:39:12,430 --> 01:39:14,468
Man: Get a ladder!

1478
01:39:14,896 --> 01:39:16,934
Man: Ruth! Ruth!

1479
01:39:25,729 --> 01:39:28,756
Please! No, please!

1480
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:31,271
Why, pa!

1481
01:39:35,996 --> 01:39:37,664
Alice.

1482
01:39:37,696 --> 01:39:39,764
Oh!

1483
01:39:39,796 --> 01:39:42,823
Hey, get up! Get up!

1484
01:39:46,464 --> 01:39:48,531
What are you going to do to him?

1485
01:39:49,063 --> 01:39:50,662
We're gonna hang him
with the rest of 'em

1486
01:39:50,686 --> 01:39:52,164
from the nearest tree.

1487
01:39:52,196 --> 01:39:54,234
Oh, no...

1488
01:39:55,764 --> 01:39:58,361
Just a minute! Just a minute!

1489
01:39:58,396 --> 01:39:59,965
Before we go, there's one thing

1490
01:39:59,996 --> 01:40:01,295
we've got to know
from our girls.

1491
01:40:01,329 --> 01:40:02,768
Girls! Girls!

1492
01:40:03,797 --> 01:40:06,064
Now, reverend, what is it
you want to know?

1493
01:40:06,096 --> 01:40:08,434
We're all fathers here,
and we love you,

01:40:08,463 --> 01:40:10,831
so don't be afraid to answer.

1495
01:40:10,864 --> 01:40:14,090
A while back I heard a wee babe
crying in the house.

1496
01:40:14,129 --> 01:40:16,037
Whose is it?

1497
01:40:16,363 --> 01:40:19,430
Whose is it?
Don't be afraid to tell.

1498

your lawfully wedded husbands?
