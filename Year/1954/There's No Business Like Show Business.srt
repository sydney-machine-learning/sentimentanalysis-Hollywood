<i>There's no business
like show business</i>

2
00:00:23,949 --> 00:00:27,911
<i>Like no business I know</i>

3
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:41,717
<i>Let's go on with the show</i>

4
00:01:21,632 --> 00:01:24,551
<i>There's no business
like show business</i>

5
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:27,888
<i>Like no business I know</i>

6
00:01:27,972 --> 00:01:30,891
<i>Yesterday they told you
you would not go far</i>

7
00:01:30,975 --> 00:01:33,894
<i>That night you open
and there you are</i>

8
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:35,729
<i>Next day on your dressing room</i>

9
00:01:35,813 --> 00:01:37,231
<i>They've hung a star</i>

10
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:44,863
<i>Let's go on with the show</i>

11
00:01:45,447 --> 00:01:47,408
<i>You promised</i>

12
00:01:47,449 --> 00:01:52,538
<i>That you'd forget me not</i>

13
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:59,920
<i>But you forgot to remember</i>

14
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:12,850
<i>When that midnight choo-choo
leaves for Alabam'</i>

15
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:14,351
<i>I got to catch that train</i>

16
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,353
<i>I'll be right there</i>

17
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:18,856
<i>I've got my fare</i>

18
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,109
<i>When I see that
rusty-haired conductor man</i>

19
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:23,193
<i>I got to find that man</i>

20
00:02:23,277 --> 00:02:24,486
<i>I'll grab him
by the collar</i>

21
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,571
<i>And I'll holler</i>

22
00:02:25,654 --> 00:02:26,697
<i>- Ala...
- Bam'</i>

23
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,865
<i>- Ala... '
- Bam...</i>

24
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,867
<i>That's where
you stop your train</i>

25
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,869
<i>That brings me back again</i>

26
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:34,204
<i>Down home
where I'll remain</i>

27
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:36,040
<i>Where my honey lamb</i>

28
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,207
<i>Am</i>

29
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,543
<i>I will be right there
with bells</i>

30
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,545
<i>When that old
conductor yells</i>

31
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:43,756
<i>All aboard</i>

32
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:47,384
<i>All aboard

<i>For Alabam'</i>

35
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,263
<i>For Alabamy</i>

36
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,389
Board!

37
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,892
<i>I'll be right there
with bells</i>

38
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:56,894
<i>When that
old conductor yells</i>

39
00:02:56,977 --> 00:02:58,729
<i>All aboard</i>

40
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:01,899
<i>For Alabam'</i>

41
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:21,335
<i>When that midnight choo-choo
leaves for Alabam'</i>

42
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:11,844
Stop!

43
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,346
<i>In days of yore
before the war</i>

44
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:16,849
<i>When hearts now old
were young</i>

45
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,184
<i>At home each night
by firelight</i>

46
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:22,521
<i>Those dear old songs
were sung</i>

47
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:25,357
<i>Sweet melodies
and memories</i>

48
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,693
<i>Around my heart
still cling</i>

49
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:31,363
<i>That's why I like
to hear a song</i>

50
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:38,454
<i>Like mother
used to sing</i>

51
00:04:38,537 --> 00:04:44,877
<i>Won't you play
a simple melody</i>

52
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:51,008
<i>Like my mother
sang to me?</i>

53
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:58,557
<i>One with good
old-fashioned harmony</i>

54
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:04,813
<i>Play a simple melody</i>

55
00:05:04,897 --> 00:05:06,065
<i>Musical demon</i>

56
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:07,316
<i>Sets your honey
a-dreamin'</i>

57
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,818
<i>Won't you
play me some rag?</i>

58
00:05:09,902 --> 00:05:11,987
<i>Just change that
classical nag</i>

59
00:05:12,071 --> 00:05:15,240
<i>To some sweet
beautiful drag</i>

60
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:17,660
<i>If you will
play from the copy</i>

61
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:18,994
<i>Of a tune
that is choppy</i>

62
00:05:19,078 --> 00:05:21,163
<i>You'll get
all my applause</i>

63
00:05:21,246 --> 00:05:24,124
<i>And that is
simply because</i>

64
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:26,627
<i>I want to listen to rag</i>

65
00:05:26,669 --> 00:05:28,170
<i>A...</i>

66
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:29,338
<i>Musical demon</i>

67
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:30,839
<i>Sets your honey
a-dreamin'</i>

68
00:05:30,923 --> 00:05:32,841
<i>But won't you
play me some rag?</i>

69
00:05:32,925 --> 00:05:35,803
<i>Just change that
classical nag</i>

70
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:38,681
<i>To some sweet
beautiful drag</i>

71
00:05:38,764 --> 00:05:41,016
<i>If you will play
from a copy</i>

72
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,685
<i>Of a tune
that is choppy</i>

73
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:44,520
<i>You'll get all
my applause</i>

74
00:05:44,603 --> 00:05:47,356
<i>And that is
simply because</i>

75
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,234
<i>I want to hear
some ragtime music</i>

76
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,860
<i>That's what
you want to hear</i>

77
00:05:51,944 --> 00:05:54,530
<i>A sweet song with
a sigh and a tear</i>

78
00:05:54,613 --> 00:06:00,661
<i>A good old
ragtime simple melody</i>

79
00:06:39,491 --> 00:06:41,368
"Peter Rabbit was a very bad
little rabbit,

80
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,703
"and that's why
Peter Rabbit

81
00:06:42,745 --> 00:06:44,204
"was sent to bed
without his supper.

82
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:46,332
"But Flopsy, Mopsy,
and Cotton-Tail,

83
00:06:46,415 --> 00:06:47,875
they had ice cream
and raspberry jam."

84
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:49,376
They say it's late.

85
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:50,502
How late?

86
00:06:50,586 --> 00:06:52,046
I don't know.

87
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:53,547
They just said
it was late.

88
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:55,049
Well, I know that.

89
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,550
You didn't have to go
all the way over there

90
00:06:56,592 --> 00:06:58,052
to find that out.

91
00:06:58,093 --> 00:06:59,553
Don't yell at me, Molly.

92
00:06:59,595 --> 00:07:01,055
I don't run the railroad.

93
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:04,475
Wake me up when
the train gets here.

94
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:05,643
Terry.

95
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:06,810
Already?

96
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,812
No. No. Terry,
this is a crummy way

97
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,314
to bring up kids.

98
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:11,815
Oh, Molly, don't start
sending the kids

99
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,317
back to your mother

100
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,818
just because
the train is late.

101
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:16,320
Steve ought to go
to school,

102
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:18,322
and they should be
sleeping in beds

103
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,823
instead of... oh,
it's just not right

104
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,325
keeping them up all hours
of the night like this.

105
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:22,826
I want them to have
an education,

106
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,328
a real education.

107
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:25,829
They have to learn
arithmetic and spelling

108
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:26,997
and geography.

109
00:07:27,081 --> 00:07:28,332
You never went past
the sixth grade.

110
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:29,833
It was probably
the fourth grade

111
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,335
because you said
it was the sixth.

112
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:32,836
My age is the only thing
I lie about,

113
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,338
and I don't add on,
I take off.

114
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:35,673
All right,
the sixth grade,

115
00:07:35,756 --> 00:07:36,840
but there's
nothing wrong

116
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,008
with your arithmetic.

117
00:07:38,092 --> 00:07:39,176
<i>You can whistle
Mandy</i>

118
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,344
<i>doing
Off To Buffalo</i>

119
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:41,720
and count the house
at the same time

120
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:42,846
and tell me
within 5 cents

121
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,014
how much is
out there.

122
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:45,349
That's not arithmetic.

123
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:46,684
Darn right that's not.

124
00:07:46,767 --> 00:07:48,018
That's higher mathematics.

125
00:07:48,102 --> 00:07:49,520
Besides,
the welfare workers

126
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,522
are going
to crack down on us

127
00:07:51,605 --> 00:07:52,856
wherever we go, just like
they did in Pittsburgh.

128
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,358
I handled it there,
didn't I?

129
00:07:54,441 --> 00:07:55,859
Why don't you let me
worry about that?

130
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:57,653
Oh, quiet. You'll
wake up the children.

131
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:05,285
Oh, Father dear,

132
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:08,288
will you see if there's
a dry diaper for the baby

133
00:08:08,372 --> 00:08:09,790
in that basket?

134
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:10,958
Diaper. Is that
the kind of thing

135
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,459
you mention in public?

136
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:13,627
Sometimes.

137
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:15,629
Don't bother. He hasn't
worn them for two years.

138
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:17,631
You know, if there was
any way to divide up

139
00:08:17,715 --> 00:08:18,799
three children evenly...

140
00:08:18,882 --> 00:08:20,301
Yes?

141
00:08:20,384 --> 00:08:22,803
<i>The Western track two.</i>

142
00:08:22,886 --> 00:08:24,305
All aboard for Scranton.

143
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:27,308
Come on, joy boy.
That's our train.

144
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,809
Come on, darling,
wake up.

145
00:08:28,892 --> 00:08:30,311
Wake up. Come on.
We have to go.

146
00:08:30,394 --> 00:08:31,812
You get these two,
will you?

147
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:33,314
And that big one.

148
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:35,316
I can handle
the rest of them.

149
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:36,817
Here, honey,
you take this one.

150
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,319
Take good care
of it now.

151
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:39,320
Help with the luggage now.

152
00:08:40,404 --> 00:08:41,822
Steve, ask your father

153
00:08:41,905 --> 00:08:43,324
if he remembered
to change my berth

154
00:08:43,407 --> 00:08:44,491
to a lower.

155
00:08:44,575 --> 00:08:45,993
Katy, ask Pop
if he remembered

156
00:08:46,076 --> 00:08:47,328
to make the change.

157
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:48,829
How about the change,
Daddy?

158
00:08:48,912 --> 00:08:50,331
I got plenty of change.

159
00:08:50,414 --> 00:08:51,832
I'll take care
of the porter.

160
00:08:51,915 --> 00:08:53,334
He says he's got it.

161
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:54,835
He got the lower, Mom.

162
00:08:54,918 --> 00:08:56,337
Good. If there's
one thing I hate,

163
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,838
it's sleeping
in an upper berth

164
00:08:57,921 --> 00:08:59,340
with three kids.

165
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:07,806
Come on, honey.

166
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:09,725
Here's Flopsy.

167
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:11,977
Here's Mopsy.

168
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:15,022
And you've got
Cotton-Tail.

169
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,985
And you, too,
Peter Rabbit.

170
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:23,614
Wait till you see our finish.

171
00:09:25,616 --> 00:09:27,284
Terry yelled
his head off, of course.

172
00:09:27,368 --> 00:09:29,286
He still wanted to keep them
on the road with us,

173
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,288
but as the children
grew older,

174
00:09:31,372 --> 00:09:32,790
I finally won out.

175
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:35,793
We put them in a very good
school in Boston.

176
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,294
Poor kids.

177
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:39,797
And that meant we had
to figure out a new act.

178
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,632
You sure had
a brilliant idea

179
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,133
for that little gem.

180
00:09:43,217 --> 00:09:44,593
I sure did:

181
00:09:44,635 --> 00:09:46,095
Eight
beautiful blondes.

182
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:47,262
Nine.

183
00:09:47,304 --> 00:09:48,430
Nine?

184
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:49,807
Yes, nine.

185
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:58,315
<i>A pretty girl</i>

186
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,653
<i>Is like a melody</i>

187
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:10,828
<i>That haunts you
night and day</i>

188
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:14,665
<i>Just like the strain</i>

189
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:18,002
<i>Of a haunting refrain</i>

190
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:21,839
<i>She'll start upon
a marathon</i>

191
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:25,509
<i>And run around
your brain</i>

192
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:28,721
<i>You can't escape</i>

193
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:33,267
<i>She's in your memory</i>

194
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:40,524
<i>By morning, night,
and noon</i>

195
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:45,696
<i>She will leave you
and then</i>

196
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,782
<i>Come back again</i>

197
00:10:48,866 --> 00:10:55,372
<i>A pretty girl is just
like a pretty tune</i>

198
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:57,374
<i>A pretty girl</i>

199
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,377
<i>La ta da
ta da de da</i>

200
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:01,545
<i>Is like a melody</i>

201
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:04,340
<i>La ta da
ta da de da</i>

202
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:08,844
<i>That haunts you
night and day</i>

203
00:11:08,886 --> 00:11:11,013
<i>They go together
like sunny weather</i>

204
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:12,514
<i>Goes with
the month of May</i>

205
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:13,849
<i>Just like the strain</i>

206
00:11:13,891 --> 00:11:15,851
<i>La la la la la la...</i>

207
00:11:15,893 --> 00:11:18,854
<i>Of a haunting refrain</i>

208
00:11:18,896 --> 00:11:22,775
<i>She'll start upon
a marathon</i>

209
00:11:22,858 --> 00:11:25,819
<i>And run around
your brain</i>

210
00:11:25,903 --> 00:11:29,698
<i>You can't escape,
no, no, no, no, n...</i>

211
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:32,701
<i>She's in your memory</i>

212
00:11:32,743 --> 00:11:41,543
<i>In your memory by
morning, night, and noon</i>

213
00:11:41,585 --> 00:11:45,714
<i>She will leave you
and then...</i>

214
00:11:45,756 --> 00:11:49,718
<i>Come back again</i>

215
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,891
<i>A pretty girl is
just like a pretty tune</i>

216
00:11:57,935 --> 00:12:00,396
Terrence was
having so much fun

217
00:12:00,437 --> 00:12:02,314
that I hated to spoil it,

218
00:12:02,398 --> 00:12:05,317
but Saturday night,
that was the end of that.

219
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:08,070
It was good-bye, blondes.

220
00:12:18,914 --> 00:12:19,999
Shh!

221
00:12:20,082 --> 00:12:21,333
Tim, we ought
to go back.

222
00:12:21,417 --> 00:12:23,335
We're just going to get
in a lot of trouble.

223
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:24,837
Katy's waiting for us
out in the bushes.

224
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,340
You're not going to go
chicken now, are you?

225
00:12:28,424 --> 00:12:29,508
Come on!

226
00:12:35,431 --> 00:12:37,516
Father Dineen:
Going somewhere?

227
00:12:37,599 --> 00:12:40,060
Suppose you come
in here, boys.

228
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:03,792
What is it?

229
00:13:03,876 --> 00:13:04,960
Trouble.

230
00:13:05,044 --> 00:13:06,128
Where?

231
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:07,129
School.

232
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:10,799
I don't want you
to think that the children

233
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:12,343
have caused
any serious trouble.

234
00:13:12,384 --> 00:13:14,345
On the contrary,
they're fine youngsters,

235
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:15,804
and we'd like
to keep them very much.

236
00:13:15,888 --> 00:13:17,348
I just thought it best

237
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:18,807
that we have
a little talk.

238
00:13:18,891 --> 00:13:20,351
I hope my telegram
didn't interfere

239
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:21,810
too much
with your plans.

240
00:13:21,894 --> 00:13:23,854
That's all right, Father.
We closed last night.

241
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:25,856
We'll be laying off
for Lent anyway.

242
00:13:25,898 --> 00:13:27,358
Oh, isn't that
interesting?

243
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:28,817
I didn't know actors

244
00:13:28,901 --> 00:13:30,361
gave up the theater
for Lent.

245
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:31,820
Well, not exactly, Father.

246
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:33,864
Let's say that the theater
gives up actors for Lent.

247
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:35,366
Does the box office
fall off?

248
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:38,369
Yes, Father. Ours falls off.
Yours picks up.

249
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:39,828
Oh, I understand,

250
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:41,372
but to return
to the children.

251
00:13:41,413 --> 00:13:43,374
The fact is, they want
to be back with you.

252
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:44,833
Did they tell you that?

253
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:46,377
Well, they've
done more than that.

254
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:48,379
They tried
to run away. Twice.

255
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,505
No.

256
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:50,673
Yes.

257
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:52,216
Why? Is the work
too much for them?

258
00:13:52,257 --> 00:13:53,676
I mean,
are they dumbbells?

259
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,219
Oh, no.
Not at all.

260
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,221
If there's something
wrong with our kids,

261
00:13:57,262 --> 00:13:59,223
you don't have
to horse around. You can...

262
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:00,808
Oh, I beg your pardon,
Father.

263
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:02,226
That's quite all right.

264
00:14:02,309 --> 00:14:03,727
No, there's nothing
wrong with them.

265
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:05,229
Quite the contrary.

266
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,730
Steve is a fine student,

267
00:14:06,814 --> 00:14:07,898
quiet, serious.

268
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:09,400
Quite an unusual boy.

269
00:14:09,483 --> 00:14:11,402
Katherine, well,
the sisters tell me

270
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:12,653
she's above average.

271
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:14,113
And, uh, Timothy?

272
00:14:14,196 --> 00:14:15,280
Well, uh...

273
00:14:15,364 --> 00:14:18,283
Timothy is all boy,
shall we say?

274
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,785
A natural born leader.

275
00:14:19,868 --> 00:14:21,286
Great kid, huh, Father?

276
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,454
Unfortunately,

277
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:23,956
sometimes he leads
the others

278
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,457
in the wrong direction.

279
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:27,126
Oh, there's
nothing serious.

280
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:28,627
What I'm trying
to say is,

281
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:30,129
the children
are just not happy

282
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:31,630
away from you
and the theater.

283
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:33,632
Happy? Who told them
they're supposed to be happy?

284
00:14:33,716 --> 00:14:35,134
They're supposed
to be learning things.

285
00:14:35,217 --> 00:14:36,635
Well, in any event,

286
00:14:36,719 --> 00:14:38,137
I think that you
and your husband

287
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,638
should have a talk
with them

288
00:14:39,722 --> 00:14:41,640
and try to explain
to them how you feel.

289
00:14:41,724 --> 00:14:43,142
Personally,
I find something

290
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:44,643
very rare and precious
in this feeling

291
00:14:44,727 --> 00:14:47,646
they have for you
and your profession.

292
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,649
Of course, it's up
to you to decide.

293
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,651
Excuse me.
I'll get them.

294
00:14:55,446 --> 00:14:57,364
Get that bit
about Tim?

295
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:58,866
"Natural born leader."

296
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:59,867
Look, birdbrain,

297
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,910
Father Dineen was trying
to tell us

298
00:15:01,952 --> 00:15:03,287
in a very nice way

299
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,289
that we've got a little
gangster on our hands.

300
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:06,790
Didn't you get it?

301
00:15:06,874 --> 00:15:08,292
The kids are going
to stay right here, Terry.

302
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,793
Who says they're not?

303
00:15:09,877 --> 00:15:11,295
Don't act so innocent.
I know you.

304
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:12,796
You're a pushover
for those kids.

305
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,298
Me? You're the one

306
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:15,799
that's always
giving in to them.

307
00:15:15,883 --> 00:15:17,301
Not this time.

308
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,553
I'm going to be as firm
as the rock of Gibraltar.

309
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,819
The rock of Gibraltar.

310
00:15:35,903 --> 00:15:38,822
The kids knew we bought
a house in Jersey,

311
00:15:38,906 --> 00:15:41,325
but this was the first
time they'd seen it.

312
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,827
And what a time
to face a big fat mortgage.

313
00:15:43,911 --> 00:15:45,162
Crash!

314
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:46,330
Depression!

315
00:15:46,413 --> 00:15:48,332
And the first thing
that people gave up

316
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:49,833
was the theater.

317
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:51,835
And the first thing
the theater gave up

318
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,337
was the Donahues.

319
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,838
Boy, the things
we had to do

320
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:56,340
to make a buck.

321
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:57,841
A couple of seasons there,

322
00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:59,343
we even split up.

323
00:16:02,012 --> 00:16:03,806
<i>She's not so good
in the house</i>

324
00:16:03,847 --> 00:16:05,808
<i>But on a bench
in the park</i>

325
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:07,643
<i>You'd be surprised</i>

326
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:08,811
<i>She isn't much
in the light</i>

327
00:16:08,852 --> 00:16:10,437
<i>But when she gets
in the dark</i>

328
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:12,815
<i>You'd be surprised</i>

329
00:16:12,856 --> 00:16:15,317
<i>At a party
or at a ball</i>

330
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,653
<i>I got to admit,
she's nothin' at all</i>

331
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:19,488
<i>But in the Morris chair</i>

332
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:22,825
<i>You'd be surprised</i>

333
00:16:22,908 --> 00:16:24,326
And when I say coffee,

334
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,328
I don't mean
just any coffee.

335
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:29,331
I mean Shelby's
aerated, vacuumized

336
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:31,333
flavor in the bean
coffee,

337
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:33,335
which comes in three
delicious grinds:

338
00:16:33,377 --> 00:16:34,503
Instant...

339
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:36,672
perk...

340
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:38,173
And drip.

341
00:16:38,215 --> 00:16:39,341
<i>So</i>

342
00:16:39,383 --> 00:16:41,343
<i>Let's have
another cup of coffee</i>

343
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:42,845
Yes, let's have another cup

344
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:45,180
of Shelby's
aerated coffee.

345
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:48,851
<i>And let's have
another piece of pie</i>

346
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:51,353
Then one day
things started picking up.

347
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:53,355
We were in the chips again,

348
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:55,858
playing big picture houses
all across the country.

349
00:16:55,899 --> 00:16:57,359
Till about '37.

350
00:16:57,401 --> 00:16:59,361
That was the year
Tim surprised us all

351
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:00,863
and graduated
from high school.

352
00:17:00,904 --> 00:17:02,781
And we started
working out a new act

353
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:04,283
for the whole family.

354
00:17:04,366 --> 00:17:07,786
Katy's love was dancing,
and the kid was good.

355
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,288
Steve was no hoofer,

356
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:11,790
but he sure could
sell a song.

357
00:17:11,874 --> 00:17:14,293
Our name
for the new act?

358
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:16,795
What else?
The Five Donahues!

359
00:17:16,879 --> 00:17:20,299
Working together,
we soon hit the top:

360
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:22,926
Headliners in a big

489
00:26:40,818 --> 00:26:42,236
Terry, have you ever
had a talk with Tim

490
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,570
about... you know... girls?

491
00:26:43,612 --> 00:26:45,072
Yeah, a few times,

492
00:26:45,155 --> 00:26:46,407
but he wouldn't give me
any phone numbers.

493
00:26:46,448 --> 00:26:47,408
No, seriously!

494
00:26:47,449 --> 00:26:48,409
You kidding?
That'd be like me

495
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,910
teaching Dempsey
how to fight.

496
00:26:49,994 --> 00:26:51,912
I wish they'd pick
on someone their own age.

497
00:26:51,996 --> 00:26:53,414
Yeah, me, too.

498
00:26:55,457 --> 00:26:57,418
I hope the kids are ready.
I'm starved.

499
00:26:57,459 --> 00:26:58,585
Me, too.

500
00:27:00,004 --> 00:27:01,296
Come in.

501
00:27:02,423 --> 00:27:04,842
Hiya, Stevie.
Be with you in a minute.

502
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:06,844
Mind if I go on ahead?

503
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:08,345
Got a date?

504
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:09,513
No, no.

505
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:11,015
It's such a beautiful night,

506
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:12,516
I just feel like walking.

507
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,018
I got some
thinking to do.

508
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:16,020
OK, if that's
your idea of fun.

509
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:17,521
See you later.

510
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:19,356
So long, Steve.

511
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,858
Terry.

512
00:27:20,941 --> 00:27:22,026
What?

513
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:24,028
Do you think something's
bothering Steve?

514
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:25,195
Why?

515
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,698
Well, he seems
so far away these days.

516
00:27:27,781 --> 00:27:30,701
I mean, he's not
always with you.

517
00:27:30,784 --> 00:27:33,203
Kind of like a poet
or something.

518
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:34,705
Maybe
he'll write lyrics.

519
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:36,874
No, it's not that.
It's...

520
00:27:36,957 --> 00:27:39,376
No, it's not that,
either. It's...

521
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,378
I don't know,
but it's something.

522
00:27:41,462 --> 00:27:42,546
Yeah.

523
00:27:42,629 --> 00:27:45,049
Well, I'm glad
we got that cleared up.

524
00:27:45,132 --> 00:27:46,216
Ready?

525
00:27:53,474 --> 00:27:54,892
Katy, we're ready.

526
00:27:56,477 --> 00:27:57,895
Katy, you in there?

527
00:28:00,981 --> 00:28:02,358
Where could she be?

528
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,360
She's usually
the first one.

529
00:28:06,737 --> 00:28:07,821
Tim?

530
00:28:07,905 --> 00:28:09,031
Timothy?

531
00:28:26,924 --> 00:28:28,342
How about it?

532
00:28:28,425 --> 00:28:29,343
Fine.

533
00:28:29,426 --> 00:28:30,844
We'll be right back.

534
00:28:30,928 --> 00:28:32,346
Well, uh, don't hurry.

535
00:28:32,429 --> 00:28:34,348
You better bring us
another gin and tonic,

536
00:28:34,431 --> 00:28:36,850
another straight bourbon,
another scotch and soda...

537
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:38,852
and another
ginger ale, please.

538
00:28:38,936 --> 00:28:40,020
Ginger ale.

539
00:28:40,104 --> 00:28:42,523
Why don't you break down
and have a real drink?

540
00:28:42,564 --> 00:28:43,691
Relax.

541
00:28:43,732 --> 00:28:45,526
Oh, I'm completely relaxed.

542
00:28:47,486 --> 00:28:49,405
Well, this is more like it.

543
00:28:49,488 --> 00:28:51,407
That other place
was a creep joint.

544
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,075
Yeah, and the one
before it was a morgue.

545
00:28:53,158 --> 00:28:54,410
Right.
I'll check my hat.

546
00:28:54,493 --> 00:28:55,786
OK, baby.

547
00:28:56,996 --> 00:28:58,122
Miss?

548
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:00,290
Uh, Miss?

549
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,876
Good evening, sir.

550
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,878
Welcome to Gallagher's
Golden Pheasant Room.

551
00:29:04,962 --> 00:29:07,381
Check your hat, sir?

552
00:29:08,966 --> 00:29:10,384
Try it again,

553
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:11,885
a little bit more
from the chest.

554
00:29:11,969 --> 00:29:13,387
Oh, you think so?
My vocal teacher sa...

555
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,389
My vocal teacher says

556
00:29:15,472 --> 00:29:16,890
it's all diaphragm.

557
00:29:16,974 --> 00:29:18,267
All diaphragm?
Hmm hmm.

558
00:29:18,309 --> 00:29:20,311
I'd say there's
quite a lot else there.

559
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:22,396
Tell me,
what's a girl

560
00:29:22,479 --> 00:29:23,731
with such
pear-shaped tones

561
00:29:23,772 --> 00:29:25,232
doing checking hats?

562
00:29:25,316 --> 00:29:26,734
I am temporarily
between engagements.

563
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:27,901
Six months temporarily.

564
00:29:27,943 --> 00:29:29,403
And a girl has to eat

565
00:29:29,486 --> 00:29:30,904
and pay
for her singing lessons.

566
00:29:30,946 --> 00:29:33,407
Oh, you're a singer?
I could've sworn

567
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:34,908
you were
a dramatic actress.

568
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,243
You think
that's impossible.

569
00:29:36,327 --> 00:29:38,245
No, no,
I can just see it now:

570
00:29:38,329 --> 00:29:39,747
You as Lady Macbeth.

571
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:41,248
What a sleep-walking
scene!

572
00:29:41,332 --> 00:29:43,083
I wonder if some evening
you'd mind...

573
00:29:43,167 --> 00:29:44,710
Skip it. I don't
give private auditions.

574
00:29:44,793 --> 00:29:46,754
Number 35.

575
00:29:46,795 --> 00:29:48,422
How now, brown cow?

576
00:29:55,512 --> 00:29:56,930
Good evening, sir.
Welcome to...

577
00:29:56,972 --> 00:29:58,932
Eddie, did you get him?
Is he coming over?

578
00:29:58,974 --> 00:30:00,434
Yeah. Believe it or not,

579
00:30:00,517 --> 00:30:03,437
the great Lew Harris is
coming over to hear you.

580
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,938
He's on his way.

581
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,440
Helen, take over
for me, will you?

582
00:30:06,523 --> 00:30:07,941
Well, sure, honey.
What's up?

583
00:30:07,983 --> 00:30:09,443
Lew Harris
is coming over.

584
00:30:09,526 --> 00:30:10,944
Lew Harris?
The producer?

585
00:30:10,986 --> 00:30:12,446
I'm going to sing
with the band.

586
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:13,947
Oh, good luck, honey.

587
00:30:13,989 --> 00:30:15,449
Is this the dress?

588
00:30:15,532 --> 00:30:16,950
Are you sure
it's the right one?

589
00:30:16,992 --> 00:30:18,952
He said it was
the one you picked out.

590
00:30:18,994 --> 00:30:20,954
It cost and arm
and a leg just to rent.

591
00:30:20,996 --> 00:30:23,457
I hope you know
what you're doing.

592
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,958
Eddie, will you
stop worrying?

593
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,461
I've known what I was doing
since I was 6 years old.

594
00:30:27,544 --> 00:30:28,962
Does Gallagher know
you're going on,

595
00:30:29,004 --> 00:30:30,464
or is this a secret

596
00:30:30,547 --> 00:30:31,965
between you
and the band?

597
00:30:32,007 --> 00:30:33,467
Sure, Mr. Gallagher's
in on it.

598
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,469
He knows I've worked
in clubs before.

599
00:30:35,552 --> 00:30:37,471
But how can you
go on and sing

600
00:30:37,554 --> 00:30:38,973
with a strange band?

601
00:30:39,014 --> 00:30:40,474
I'm not singing
with a strange band.

602
00:30:40,557 --> 00:30:41,976
I rehearsed with them
all afternoon,

603
00:30:42,017 --> 00:30:43,477
and they're very friendly.

604
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,979
The head waiter's name
is Carlos.

605
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,981
He has a very good table
for you and Mr. Harris.

606
00:30:47,022 --> 00:30:48,983
And the drinks
are on the house.

607
00:30:49,024 --> 00:30:50,484
Carlos is in on it, too?

608
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:52,486
Of course. He's even going
to make the waiters

609
00:30:52,569 --> 00:30:53,988
stop serving
while I sing,

610
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:55,489
and he's very
friendly, too.

611
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:56,991
I have been an agent
for a good many years,

612
00:30:57,032 --> 00:30:59,493
but this is
the first time

613
00:30:59,576 --> 00:31:00,744
the client
has ever managed me.

614
00:31:00,828 --> 00:31:02,204
Oh, and another thing.

615
00:31:02,246 --> 00:31:04,206
When you bring him back
to see me,

616
00:31:04,248 --> 00:31:06,208
I want to show him
that I'm an actress, too.

617
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,210
<i>I've been working on a scene
from The Cherry Orchard.</i>

618
00:31:08,252 --> 00:31:09,712
<i>The Cherry Orchard.</i>

619
00:31:09,753 --> 00:31:11,213
Vicky, let's save the acting

620
00:31:11,255 --> 00:31:13,716
as a surprise for him
for later. Much later.

621
00:31:13,757 --> 00:31:16,218
Right now, Mr. Harris
wants a singer.

622
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,636
A hot singer!

623
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,929
What song
are you singing?

624
00:31:19,013 --> 00:31:20,306
I'm singing

625
00:31:20,389 --> 00:31:22,641
"After You Get What You Want,
You Don't Want It."

626
00:31:22,725 --> 00:31:24,643
Vicky, for the love
of Mike,

627
00:31:24,727 --> 00:31:26,270
will you forget that
elocution stuff?

628
00:31:26,353 --> 00:31:27,771
<i>It's
After</i>

629
00:31:27,855 --> 00:31:30,274
<i>You Get What You Want.
After. After. After.</i>

630
00:31:30,357 --> 00:31:32,276
OK, Eddie. You run down
and wait for Mr. Harris.

631
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:33,444
I'll change.

632
00:31:33,527 --> 00:31:35,446
<i>After.</i>

633
00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:36,947
After.

634
00:31:37,031 --> 00:31:38,449
After.

635
00:31:38,532 --> 00:31:40,409
After.

636
00:31:40,492 --> 00:31:42,411
The girls
in the chorus say

637
00:31:42,494 --> 00:31:43,912
you're not to be trusted.

638
00:31:43,996 --> 00:31:45,414
Yeah? What else
they say about me?

639
00:31:45,497 --> 00:31:46,915
Wouldn't you
like to know?

640
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:48,083
Yeah.

641
00:31:48,167 --> 00:31:49,585
I beg your pardon.
May I please get by here?

642
00:31:49,668 --> 00:31:51,086
Well, if it isn't
Ethel Barrymore.

643
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,588
It was only
yesterday...

644
00:31:52,671 --> 00:31:54,590
Please, let's not play
any more games.

645
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:56,091
I'm in an awful hurry.

646
00:31:56,175 --> 00:31:58,093
Must be losing my grip.

647
00:31:58,177 --> 00:31:59,595
Something's
happening to me.

648
00:31:59,678 --> 00:32:01,096
You're getting old,
Buster.

649
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,556
Why, you must be
almost 20.

650
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,558
What difference does it
make how old a man is?

651
00:32:04,642 --> 00:32:06,060
Listen, Cheri,

652
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:08,062
one man in 20 years
may still be a baby,

653
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:09,563
<i>a mere enfant,</i>

654
00:32:09,647 --> 00:32:11,565
but another may have
lived a full lifetime,

655
00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:13,067
seen everything,
done everything.

656
00:32:13,108 --> 00:32:15,569
<i>It is not how old
you are, mon patoot.</i>

657
00:32:15,653 --> 00:32:17,071
It is the way
you have lived.

658
00:32:17,112 --> 00:32:19,073
It's the wine
you have drunk,

659
00:32:19,114 --> 00:32:20,574
the music
you have heard,

660
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:22,076
and the women
you have known.

661
00:32:22,117 --> 00:32:25,079
Oh, the stories
I could tell you, kid.

662
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,580
Yeah?
So tell me.

663
00:32:26,664 --> 00:32:28,582
Well, I... Hey, hey.
I'll take the bottle.

664
00:32:28,666 --> 00:32:30,292
And bring another
double gin

665
00:32:30,334 --> 00:32:31,877
for Snow White.

666
00:32:47,017 --> 00:32:48,978
You know,
you're real cute.

667
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:50,104
Oh.

668
00:32:50,187 --> 00:32:52,022
Well, uh, bottom's up.

669
00:32:57,861 --> 00:32:59,321
You're pretty cute
yourself.

670
00:32:59,363 --> 00:33:01,323
Well, now,
that's more like it.

671
00:33:01,365 --> 00:33:03,242
I thought you were great
in the show tonight.

672
00:33:03,325 --> 00:33:04,743
Oh, did you?

673
00:33:04,827 --> 00:33:06,245
Uh-huh.
You were swell.

674
00:33:06,328 --> 00:33:07,746
Oh, thank you,
but you know,

675
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,748
you didn't see
all of it.

676
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:10,916
No?

677
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,918
No. We've got a lot
of comedy stuff

678
00:33:13,002 --> 00:33:14,420
that we didn't do.
Real slapstick.

679
00:33:14,503 --> 00:33:15,921
I like slapstick.

680
00:33:16,005 --> 00:33:17,423
I'll bet you do.

681
00:33:17,506 --> 00:33:19,425
We have one bit
that never fails.

682
00:33:19,508 --> 00:33:20,926
Here.
I'll show you.

683
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,429
Put your hands out
like this, flat.

684
00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:24,930
Now, I take
these two glasses

685
00:33:25,014 --> 00:33:26,932
and put them like so.

686
00:33:27,016 --> 00:33:28,100
And?

687
00:33:28,183 --> 00:33:29,268
That's all.

688
00:33:29,351 --> 00:33:30,936
Bye!

689
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,313
Hey!

690
00:33:33,522 --> 00:33:34,940
Mr. Harris' table.

691
00:33:35,024 --> 00:33:36,442
We have a reservation.

692
00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:38,444
Yes, sir.
This way, please.

693
00:33:43,699 --> 00:33:45,117
Ladies and gentlemen,

694
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,618
ladies and gentlemen,

695
00:33:46,702 --> 00:33:49,621
Gallagher's has a little
surprise for you tonight:

696
00:33:49,705 --> 00:33:52,124
A new young talent,
Miss Victoria Hoffman.

697
00:33:52,207 --> 00:33:53,625
Come on, everybody,

698
00:33:53,709 --> 00:33:56,670
let's give the little girl
a great big welcome.

699
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:20,569
<i>After you get
what you want</i>

700
00:34:20,653 --> 00:34:23,739
<i>You don't want it</i>

701
00:34:23,822 --> 00:34:27,993
<i>If I gave you the moon</i>

702
00:34:28,035 --> 00:34:31,664
<i>You'd grow tired
of it soon</i>

703
00:34:31,747 --> 00:34:35,417
<i>You're like a baby</i>

704
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:39,755
<i>You want what you want
when you want it</i>

705
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:45,928
<i>But after you are
presented</i>

706
00:34:46,011 --> 00:34:47,262
<i>With what you want</i>

707
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:50,265
<i>You're discontented</i>

708
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:54,770
<i>You're always
wishing and wanting for</i>

709
00:34:54,853 --> 00:34:56,438
<i>Something</i>

710
00:34:56,522 --> 00:35:00,275
<i>When you get
what you want</i>

711
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:04,863
<i>You don't want
what you get</i>

712
00:35:04,947 --> 00:35:10,035
<i>And though I
sit upon your knee</i>

713
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:13,872
<i>You grow tired of me</i>

714
00:35:13,956 --> 00:35:16,208
<i>'Cause after</i>

715
00:35:16,291 --> 00:35:18,043
<i>You get what you want</i>

716
00:35:18,127 --> 00:35:22,047
<i>You don't want what
you wanted at all</i>

717
00:35:29,972 --> 00:35:31,890
<i>Changeable</i>

718
00:35:31,974 --> 00:35:36,228
<i>You've got
a changeable nature</i>

719
00:35:37,479 --> 00:35:43,152
<i>Always, always
changing your mind</i>

720
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,405
<i>There's a longing
in your eye</i>

721
00:35:46,488 --> 00:35:49,408
<i>Hard to satisfy</i>

722
00:35:49,491 --> 00:35:56,415
<i>And here's
the reason why</i>

723
00:35:56,498 --> 00:36:01,754
<i>'Cause after</i>

724
00:36:01,837 --> 00:36:03,088
<i>You get what you want</i>

725
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:06,050
<i>You don't want it</i>

726
00:36:06,091 --> 00:36:10,387
<i>If I gave you the moon</i>

727
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:14,558
<i>You'd grow tired
of it soon</i>

728
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,895
<i>You're like a baby</i>

729
00:36:17,936 --> 00:36:22,399
<i>You want what you want
when you want it</i>

730
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:28,238
<i>But after you are
presented</i>

731
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,074
<i>With what you want</i>

732
00:36:30,115 --> 00:36:33,410
<i>You're discontented</i>

733
00:36:33,494 --> 00:36:37,623
<i>You're always
wishing and wanting for</i>

734
00:36:37,706 --> 00:36:39,083
<i>Something</i>

735
00:36:39,124 --> 00:36:43,087
<i>When you get
what you want</i>

736
00:36:43,128 --> 00:36:47,675
<i>You don't want
what you get</i>

737
00:36:47,758 --> 00:36:52,763
<i>And though I sit
upon your knee</i>

738
00:36:52,805 --> 00:36:56,934
<i>You grow tired of me</i>

739
00:36:56,976 --> 00:36:58,936
<i>'Cause after</i>

740
00:36:58,978 --> 00:37:00,771
<i>You get what you want</i>

741
00:37:00,813 --> 00:37:04,858
<i>You don't want
what you wanted at all</i>

742
00:37:04,942 --> 00:37:09,029
<i>Baby, I don't mean
to make you blue</i>

743
00:37:09,113 --> 00:37:13,033
<i>But you need
a talkin' to</i>

744
00:37:13,117 --> 00:37:15,869
<i>'Cause after</i>

745
00:37:15,953 --> 00:37:17,329
<i>You get what you want</i>

746
00:37:17,413 --> 00:37:24,712
<i>You don't want
what you wanted at all</i>

747
00:37:24,795 --> 00:37:26,588
I know you!

748
00:37:36,557 --> 00:37:39,018
Well, what do you think?

749
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:40,853
I'm interested.

750
00:37:40,894 --> 00:37:41,854
I knew it.

751
00:37:41,895 --> 00:37:43,689
I knew you'd
flip your lid

752
00:37:43,731 --> 00:37:45,858
over this girl.
Ha ha ha ha.

753
00:37:47,067 --> 00:37:50,446
How do you do, Mr. Harris?

754
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:55,492
Hello, Mr. Harris.

755
00:37:55,576 --> 00:37:57,578
Hi there, Mr. Harris.

756
00:38:03,125 --> 00:38:04,209
Hello.

757
00:38:04,293 --> 00:38:05,377
Oh, not again.

758
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:07,379
I'm waiting for someone
terribly important.

759
00:38:07,421 --> 00:38:09,048
This is
terribly important, too.

760
00:38:09,131 --> 00:38:10,674
<i>I happen to be
Kirby from Variety.</i>

761
00:38:10,758 --> 00:38:11,967
I think the world
should know about you.

762
00:38:12,051 --> 00:38:13,052
How about an interview?

763
00:38:13,135 --> 00:38:14,845
This not another one
of your little jokes.

764
00:38:14,887 --> 00:38:16,013
Oh, no,
not when I'm working.

765
00:38:16,055 --> 00:38:18,307
The only thing is I'm
expecting these people.

766
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,475
That's all right.
Why don't we start

767
00:38:19,558 --> 00:38:22,061
and see how far we get.
Oh, excuse me.

768
00:38:22,144 --> 00:38:25,481
Uh, tell me, have you had
any previous experience?

769
00:38:25,564 --> 00:38:26,899
Doing what?

770
00:38:26,982 --> 00:38:28,609
I was thinking
of your stage career,

771
00:38:28,692 --> 00:38:29,610
but I'd be interested
in anything else

772
00:38:29,693 --> 00:38:30,611
you have to tell me.

773
00:38:30,694 --> 00:38:32,112
I see.

774
00:38:32,196 --> 00:38:34,073
Why don't I give you
my telephone number?

775
00:38:34,156 --> 00:38:35,074
Why don't you?

776
00:38:35,157 --> 00:38:36,950
I have
a much better idea.

777
00:38:37,034 --> 00:38:38,744
<i>I'll call you
tomorrow at Variety,</i>

778
00:38:38,827 --> 00:38:39,953
and we can make a date.

779
00:38:40,037 --> 00:38:41,288
Oh, it's, uh, well,

780
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:42,790
tomorrow happens
to be my day off.

781
00:38:42,873 --> 00:38:44,583
I was afraid
of something like that.

782
00:38:45,668 --> 00:38:47,711
Excuse me.
That must be my guests.

783
00:38:48,712 --> 00:38:50,839
Oh, hello.

784
00:38:50,923 --> 00:38:52,925
Vicky, this is
Mr. Lew Harris.

785
00:38:53,008 --> 00:38:54,551
Charmed, I'm sure.

786
00:38:54,635 --> 00:38:56,512
I enjoyed your performance,
Miss Hoffman.

787
00:38:56,595 --> 00:38:58,055
Did you?
Did you really?

788
00:38:58,138 --> 00:38:59,098
Come in please.

789
00:38:59,181 --> 00:39:00,933
This gentleman
was just leaving.

790
00:39:01,016 --> 00:39:03,268
Tim Donahue.
How are you, kid?

791
00:39:03,352 --> 00:39:05,437
I hear you and the family
are knockin' 'em dead

792
00:39:05,521 --> 00:39:06,438
over at the Hippodrome.

793
00:39:06,522 --> 00:39:07,439
Thank you, Mr. Harris.

794
00:39:07,523 --> 00:39:08,816
One of
The Five Donahues?

795
00:39:08,899 --> 00:39:10,567
Oh, you do
a great act.

796
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:11,860
I didn't know
you knew him.

797
00:39:11,944 --> 00:39:14,196
We just met.
Mr. Donahue,

798
00:39:14,279 --> 00:39:15,948
it was awfully sweet
of you to come back

799
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,283
and tell me how much
you admired my work.

800
00:39:18,325 --> 00:39:19,368
When one performer

801
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:20,869
troubles
to tell another,

802
00:39:20,953 --> 00:39:23,622
that's praise indeed.
And tell your family

803
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:24,957
while I do
appreciate it,

804
00:39:24,999 --> 00:39:27,376
I couldn't possibly
join their act.

805
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:28,544
I'll tell 'em,

806
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:30,379
but they'll
be brokenhearted.

807
00:39:30,462 --> 00:39:33,590
I'm sorry, but there are
five of you already,

808
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,884
and I much prefer
working as a single,

809
00:39:35,968 --> 00:39:40,806
if you know what I mean,
and I think you do.

810
00:39:45,978 --> 00:39:48,063
Mad about me.

811
00:39:50,858 --> 00:39:53,610
Timmy, where you been?

812
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:55,279
I been lookin'
everywhere for you.

813
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:56,864
I just fumbled,
and the coach took me out.

814
00:39:56,947 --> 00:39:58,449
Whoop,
that's a cute step.

815
00:39:58,532 --> 00:39:59,700
Come on,
let's go someplace

816
00:39:59,783 --> 00:40:01,285
where they appreciate me.

817
00:40:06,123 --> 00:40:07,958
Oh, this is silly.

818
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,835
After all, they're
not children anymore.

819
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:12,046
No. Come on,
I got a good hand.

820
00:40:12,129 --> 00:40:14,506
They're certainly old enough
to take care of themselves.

821
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,133
Exactly. You go.

822
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:17,718
Why do you suppose
they didn't tell us,

823
00:40:17,801 --> 00:40:19,261
just sneaking out
that way without...

824
00:40:19,345 --> 00:40:22,222
Molly, that's just
part of growing up.

825
00:40:22,306 --> 00:40:24,099
Remember our first date?

826
00:40:24,183 --> 00:40:26,060
Yeah.

827
00:40:26,143 --> 00:40:27,895
We didn't tell anybody,
either.

828
00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:28,979
No.

829
00:40:29,063 --> 00:40:31,357
You remember how late
we stayed out?

830
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,441
Mm-hmm.

831
00:40:32,524 --> 00:40:35,861
You should've been
ashamed of yourself.

832
00:40:35,903 --> 00:40:38,280
Where the heck
is Katy?

833
00:40:38,364 --> 00:40:40,324
Take it easy.
Now you got me worried.

834
00:40:40,366 --> 00:40:42,242
It's about time,
you big lug.

835
00:40:42,326 --> 00:40:44,495
Here's a taxi.

836
00:40:50,376 --> 00:40:53,003
What do you mean
by coming home

837
00:40:53,045 --> 00:40:54,254
at this hour,
young lady?

838
00:40:54,338 --> 00:40:55,756
You have some
explaining to do.

839
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,091
How sweet of you
to wait up for me.

840
00:40:57,174 --> 00:40:59,301
Do pay the cab fare,
darling.

841
00:40:59,385 --> 00:41:00,719
I'm flat.

842
00:41:00,761 --> 00:41:02,513
Where did
you pick her up?

843
00:41:02,554 --> 00:41:04,056
Outside of Gallagher's joint.

844
00:41:04,139 --> 00:41:05,391
How much do I owe you?

845
00:41:05,474 --> 00:41:06,475
6.20.

846
00:41:06,558 --> 00:41:08,686
6.20? How'd ya come,
by way of Canarsie?

847
00:41:08,769 --> 00:41:09,937
I brought her home,
didn't I?

848
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,397
Thanks.
Got change of 20?

849
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,815
Oh, yeah.

850
00:41:12,898 --> 00:41:14,733
And for all I know, Mom,

851
00:41:14,817 --> 00:41:16,485
he's still sitting there,

852
00:41:16,568 --> 00:41:17,695
dripping.

853
00:41:17,778 --> 00:41:19,613
Let me tell you about
the one I used to use.

854
00:41:19,697 --> 00:41:21,240
A handbag
full of nickels...

855
00:41:21,323 --> 00:41:23,575
anybody got fresh...
clunk.

856
00:41:23,617 --> 00:41:26,620
We used to call it
the woman's defender.

857
00:41:26,704 --> 00:41:28,580
What's so funny?
Your daughter stays out

858
00:41:28,664 --> 00:41:30,207
gallivanting till
all hours of the morning,

859
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,375
and you think
it's a big joke.

860
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:32,793
Maybe Katy never went
to finishing school,

861
00:41:32,876 --> 00:41:34,586
but there are some parts
of her education

862
00:41:34,628 --> 00:41:36,547
I'll match against anybody's.

863
00:41:36,588 --> 00:41:38,424
Um, Tim get home yet?

864
00:41:38,465 --> 00:41:41,051
No. Why? You see him?
You know where he is?

865
00:41:41,135 --> 00:41:43,137
No. I just wondered.

866
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,222
Where in blazes
have you been?

867
00:41:45,264 --> 00:41:46,265
In church.

868
00:41:46,348 --> 00:41:47,641
Church?

869
00:41:47,725 --> 00:41:48,642
Now I've heard
everything.

870
00:41:48,726 --> 00:41:49,852
No, seriously.

871
00:41:49,935 --> 00:41:51,270
Church at this time
of night?

872
00:41:51,353 --> 00:41:53,439
I went for a walk
through the park first.

873
00:41:53,522 --> 00:41:54,773
Who with?

874
00:41:54,815 --> 00:41:56,608
Nobody. Just myself.

875
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,110
Mom, Dad,

876
00:41:58,152 --> 00:41:59,611
there's something
I want to tell you.

877
00:41:59,695 --> 00:42:01,113
Well...

878
00:42:01,196 --> 00:42:02,239
I don't want you to think

879
00:42:02,323 --> 00:42:04,825
I haven't given this
a lot of thought, but...

880
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:05,909
Go on.

881
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:08,287
I'm going
to be a priest.

882
00:42:08,329 --> 00:42:09,288
A what?!

883
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,497
A priest.

884
00:42:10,581 --> 00:42:11,707
You're kidding.

885
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,500
Steve, what are
you talkin' about?

886
00:42:13,584 --> 00:42:15,252
I know this
comes as a big shock

887
00:42:15,294 --> 00:42:16,795
to all of you, but...

888
00:42:16,879 --> 00:42:17,838
it's what I want

889
00:42:17,921 --> 00:42:19,298
more than anything else
in the world.

890
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,134
A priest?!
Why, you must be abs...

891
00:42:22,176 --> 00:42:23,636
Let him finish, Terry.

892
00:42:23,677 --> 00:42:25,137
I talked to Father Dineen

893
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:27,097
about it last summer.
Today I got a letter

894
00:42:27,139 --> 00:42:28,140
telling me to report
to the seminary

895
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,141
next week.

896
00:42:29,224 --> 00:42:30,601
I am not going
to let you do it.

897
00:42:30,643 --> 00:42:31,602
Terry...

898
00:42:31,644 --> 00:42:32,645
Now, you
stay out of this.

899
00:42:32,686 --> 00:42:34,688
Look, son,
you're very young.

900
00:42:34,772 --> 00:42:35,689
You don't understand

901
00:42:35,773 --> 00:42:36,774
what a wonderful thing
life can be.

902
00:42:36,857 --> 00:42:38,317
You don't know
how wonderful it is

903
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:39,777
to fall in love
and get married

904
00:42:39,818 --> 00:42:40,819
and raise a family.

905
00:42:40,903 --> 00:42:42,321
I'm not gonna let you
give all that up.

906
00:42:42,404 --> 00:42:44,448
I've thought
about it, Pop.

907
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,117
It's just that some people
are meant to be one thing,

908
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:48,869
some another.

909
00:42:48,952 --> 00:42:50,037
What about your work?

910
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,330
What about everything
you've been trained for?

911
00:42:51,413 --> 00:42:52,623
What about the theater?

912
00:42:52,665 --> 00:42:55,042
In a way, it's just
a change of booking.

913
00:42:55,125 --> 00:42:58,170
You must admit the church
has had a pretty long run.

914
00:42:58,253 --> 00:43:01,423
I just hope
I have the talent for it.

915
00:43:01,507 --> 00:43:02,883
Beats me.

916
00:43:02,966 --> 00:43:05,135
I can't figure it out.

917
00:43:05,177 --> 00:43:07,763
<i>Come on along,
come on along</i>

918
00:43:07,846 --> 00:43:10,432
<i>Alexander's
Ragtime Band</i>

919
00:43:10,516 --> 00:43:12,851
<i>Come on along
Hello, everybody.</i>

920
00:43:12,893 --> 00:43:14,061
Oh, great.

921
00:43:14,144 --> 00:43:15,521
He's crocked.

922
00:43:15,562 --> 00:43:17,523
I beg your pardon...
stinkied.

923
00:43:17,606 --> 00:43:20,484
Whoops, forgot
to remove my hat.

924
00:43:20,526 --> 00:43:21,527
I'll fix him.

925
00:43:21,568 --> 00:43:22,820
- Now...
- Pop...

926
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:24,905
I can handle him. I've been
handling him his whole life.

927
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:26,907
Is there some sort
of dispute going on?

928
00:43:26,991 --> 00:43:28,784
Can I be
of any assis...

929
00:43:28,867 --> 00:43:31,161
Can I be of any...

930
00:43:31,203 --> 00:43:33,288
Oh, Mom, I don't
feel so good.

931
00:43:33,372 --> 00:43:35,541
Oh, no, you don't.
Upstairs for you.

932
00:43:35,624 --> 00:43:38,460
I just had
this carpet cleaned.

933
00:43:38,544 --> 00:43:41,213
What a family.
One of 'em

934
00:43:41,255 --> 00:43:42,339
goes sneaking off
to a nightclub,

935
00:43:42,381 --> 00:43:44,174
one of ‘em comes home
smelling like a saloon,

936
00:43:44,216 --> 00:43:46,885
and the third one... you...
I might've expected you

937
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:49,221
to come home drunk like Tim,
but I will be a Hindu swami

938
00:43:49,263 --> 00:43:50,848
if I expected
what you gave me tonight.

939
00:43:50,931 --> 00:43:52,433
Pop, don't take it
so big.

940
00:43:52,516 --> 00:43:53,684
Steve might turn out

941
00:43:53,726 --> 00:43:54,893
to be something
really big,

942
00:43:54,977 --> 00:43:57,896
like a bishop
or even a cardinal.

943
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,607
Yeah? The only cardinal
I want in this family

944
00:44:00,691 --> 00:44:03,402
is one that plays ball
with St. Louis.

945
00:44:05,112 --> 00:44:07,239
I could take a...

946
00:44:07,323 --> 00:44:08,282
Bath.

947
00:44:08,324 --> 00:44:10,534
Big man now.
Comin' home like...

948
00:44:10,617 --> 00:44:12,077
You're drowning me.

949
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:13,829
Don't put any ideas
in my head.

950
00:44:13,912 --> 00:44:14,830
Yeah, but I...

951
00:44:14,913 --> 00:44:16,582
Down, boy. Down.

952
00:44:16,665 --> 00:44:19,585
And don't come up
till I tell ya.

953
00:44:23,005 --> 00:44:24,840
Where am I?

954
00:44:29,553 --> 00:44:30,638
Here.

955
00:44:31,722 --> 00:44:32,723
Give me that.

956
00:44:32,806 --> 00:44:35,184
Will you please, Ma?

957
00:44:35,267 --> 00:44:38,270
Timmy, this hurts you
more than it hurts me.

958
00:44:38,312 --> 00:44:40,064
Now get in there.

959
00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:42,441
I'm getting there.

960
00:44:42,483 --> 00:44:45,110
Come on, get in.
Hurry up.

961
00:44:45,194 --> 00:44:48,113
This way. Put your head
down here on the pillow.

962
00:44:48,155 --> 00:44:49,114
Come on.

963
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:57,206
All right,
let's have it, sport.

964
00:44:57,289 --> 00:44:58,874
Who were you out with?

965
00:44:58,957 --> 00:45:00,334
Lillian Sawyer.

966
00:45:00,376 --> 00:45:01,835
That tomato?

967
00:45:01,877 --> 00:45:05,339
I think I asked her
to marry me, Mom.

968
00:45:05,381 --> 00:45:07,716
I know I proposed
something.

969
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,260
I bet you did.
What'd you have to drink?

970
00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:13,180
I don't remember,
but we topped it off

971
00:45:13,222 --> 00:45:14,682
with champagne
and root beer.

972
00:45:14,723 --> 00:45:17,101
I was trying to forget.

973
00:45:17,184 --> 00:45:18,143
Forget what?

974
00:45:18,185 --> 00:45:20,604
That's another thing
I don't remember.

975
00:45:20,688 --> 00:45:22,815
Another girl, I think.

976
00:45:22,856 --> 00:45:24,692
Little man,
you've had a busy night.

977
00:45:24,775 --> 00:45:28,404
Yeah. Hello? Hello?

978
00:45:28,487 --> 00:45:30,239
Everything's going
round and round, Ma.

979
00:45:30,322 --> 00:45:31,991
Yes, I know. I know.

980
00:45:32,074 --> 00:45:34,034
You go to sleep now.
We'll talk this over

981
00:45:34,118 --> 00:45:35,035
in the morning.

982
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:36,036
Oh.

983
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,080
I'm sorry, Mom.

984
00:45:38,163 --> 00:45:39,873
I know you are, kid,

985
00:45:39,957 --> 00:45:42,501
and I'm sorry, too,
if I hurt you.

986
00:45:42,584 --> 00:45:45,045
It's just that
we love you so much

987
00:45:45,129 --> 00:45:46,547
that we intend
to make a man out of you,

988
00:45:46,588 --> 00:45:48,632
even if we have
to murder you first.

989
00:45:48,716 --> 00:45:50,175
Thanks, Mom.

990
00:45:50,259 --> 00:45:52,720
Go to sleep now.

991
00:45:52,761 --> 00:45:54,346
Good night, Ma.

992
00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:55,973
Good night, Tim.

993
00:46:02,479 --> 00:46:03,897
Is he all right?

994
00:46:03,939 --> 00:46:05,524
Oh, he's fine now,

995
00:46:05,607 --> 00:46:07,568
but what he's gonna
feel like in the morning.

996
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:12,948
Anyway, I hope so.
Steve, I wanna talk to you.

997
00:46:13,032 --> 00:46:14,825
Sure, Mom.

998
00:46:20,414 --> 00:46:22,875
Are you disappointed
in me, too,

999
00:46:22,916 --> 00:46:24,335
the way Dad is?

1000
00:46:24,418 --> 00:46:26,170
You can't blame
your father, Steve,

1001
00:46:26,253 --> 00:46:28,130
the way you
threw it at him,

1002
00:46:28,213 --> 00:46:30,174
just cold,
without any buildup.

1003
00:46:30,257 --> 00:46:31,675
He wasn't lookin' for it.

1004
00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:33,927
He had different plans
for you.

1005
00:46:34,011 --> 00:46:35,971
There's still
Katy and Tim.

1006
00:46:36,055 --> 00:46:38,057
Yes, but you're
the firstborn.

1007
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,226
There's always something
about the first.

1008
00:46:41,268 --> 00:46:45,481
Life's funny.
You raise a kid backstage,

1009
00:46:45,564 --> 00:46:47,566
you teach him
every trick you know

1010
00:46:47,608 --> 00:46:51,445
about singing and dancing
and how to make people laugh,

1011
00:46:51,487 --> 00:46:54,281
and then one day, this.

1012
00:46:54,365 --> 00:46:57,493
Why? How come?

1013
00:46:57,576 --> 00:47:00,996
I don't know, Ma.
It's inside me.

1014
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,957
It must have
always been there.

1015
00:47:11,757 --> 00:47:13,759
It's like losin' ya, Steve.

1016
00:47:13,842 --> 00:47:16,387
Oh, I know,
not really, but...

1017
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:17,805
Then you are
disappointed.

1018
00:47:17,888 --> 00:47:21,308
No, I'm not disappointed.
It's a wonderful thing.

1019
00:47:21,392 --> 00:47:23,936
I'm just not
used to it yet,

1020
00:47:23,978 --> 00:47:27,481
but I'm proud.
Very proud.

1021
00:47:27,564 --> 00:47:29,400
Mom.

1022
00:47:29,483 --> 00:47:32,528
<i>Remember the night</i>

1023
00:47:32,611 --> 00:47:35,322
<i>The night you said</i>

1024
00:47:35,406 --> 00:47:38,242
<i>I love you?</i>

1025
00:47:38,325 --> 00:47:41,412
<i>Remember?</i>

1026
00:47:41,495 --> 00:47:44,039
<i>Remember,
my love</i>

1027
00:47:44,123 --> 00:47:47,042
<i>All the stars</i>

1028
00:47:47,126 --> 00:47:49,670
<i>Above you?</i>

1029
00:47:49,753 --> 00:47:52,464
<i>Remember?</i>

1030
00:47:52,506 --> 00:47:58,304
<i>Remember, we vowed
to own this spot</i>

1031
00:47:58,345 --> 00:48:03,726
<i>And after I learned
to care a lot</i>

1032
00:48:03,809 --> 00:48:06,729
<i>You promised that you'd</i>

1033
00:48:06,812 --> 00:48:11,275
<i>Forget me not</i>

1034
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:16,363
<i>But you forgot</i>

1035
00:48:16,447 --> 00:48:24,204
<i>To reme-em-em-ber</i>

1036
00:48:24,246 --> 00:48:26,165
When do we open?

1037
00:48:26,206 --> 00:48:27,166
Where?

1038
00:48:27,207 --> 00:48:28,834
Have another sandwich.

1039
00:48:30,169 --> 00:48:32,212
Oh, come on,
let's go inside.

1040
00:48:32,296 --> 00:48:33,255
They're starting.

1041
00:48:33,339 --> 00:48:34,798
Showtime.

1042
00:48:34,882 --> 00:48:36,342
Quiet!

1043
00:48:36,383 --> 00:48:38,010
Terry:
Showtime! Showtime!

1044
00:48:38,093 --> 00:48:41,055
You all get settled down.

1045
00:48:42,848 --> 00:48:45,851
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

1046
00:48:45,893 --> 00:48:49,521
There. Now, since you were
nice enough to surprise me,

1047
00:48:49,605 --> 00:48:51,273
I have a surprise for you.

1048
00:48:51,357 --> 00:48:53,859
We have a couple of
very talented young people

1049
00:48:53,942 --> 00:48:56,278
here with us tonight... songs,
dances, and impressions...

1050
00:48:56,362 --> 00:48:59,114
And they would like
to perform for you.

1051
00:48:59,198 --> 00:49:01,659
Now, this act
hasn't been seen

1052
00:49:01,742 --> 00:49:03,285
in something like
20 years,

1053
00:49:03,369 --> 00:49:04,870
and if I'm any
judge of talent,

1054
00:49:04,953 --> 00:49:06,580
it'll never be seen again.

1055
00:49:06,664 --> 00:49:10,334
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Two Donahues!

1056
00:49:20,094 --> 00:49:22,221
<i>When that
midnight choo-choo</i>

1057
00:49:22,262 --> 00:49:23,514
<i>Leaves for Alabam'</i>

1058
00:49:23,597 --> 00:49:24,556
<i>I gotta catch that train</i>

1059
00:49:24,598 --> 00:49:26,141
<i>I'll be right there</i>

1060
00:49:26,225 --> 00:49:28,185
<i>I got my fare</i>

1061
00:49:28,268 --> 00:49:31,480
<i>When I see that
rusty-haired conductor man</i>

1062
00:49:31,563 --> 00:49:32,648
<i>I gotta find that man</i>

1063
00:49:32,731 --> 00:49:34,233
<i>I'll grab him
by the collar</i>

1064
00:49:34,274 --> 00:49:35,275
<i>And I'll holler</i>

1065
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:36,777
<i>- Ala
- Bam'</i>

1066
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,737
<i>That's where you
stop your train</i>

1067
00:49:38,779 --> 00:49:40,781
<i>That brings me
back again</i>

1068
00:49:40,864 --> 00:49:42,616
<i>Down home
where I'll remain</i>

1069
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,327
<i>Where my honey lamb am</i>

1070
00:49:45,411 --> 00:49:47,371
<i>I will be
right there with bells</i>

1071
00:49:47,454 --> 00:49:49,456
<i>When that
old conductor yells</i>

1072
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,291
<i>All aboard, all aboard</i>

1073
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:55,087
<i>All aboard
for Alabamy</i>

1074
00:49:55,129 --> 00:49:57,297
<i>For Alabam'</i>

1075
00:49:57,381 --> 00:49:58,424
<i>For Alabamy</i>

1076
00:49:58,465 --> 00:49:59,633
Board!

1077
00:49:59,717 --> 00:50:01,427
<i>I'll be right there
with bells</i>

1078
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,721
<i>When that
old conductor yells</i>

1079
00:50:03,804 --> 00:50:05,431
<i>All aboo-rd</i>

1080
00:50:05,472 --> 00:50:08,642
<i>For Alabam'</i>

1081
00:50:17,192 --> 00:50:20,904
<i>When that midnight
choo-choo leaves for</i>

1082
00:50:20,988 --> 00:50:27,161
<i>Alabam'</i>

1083
00:50:56,899 --> 00:50:57,900
Thank you.

1084
00:50:57,983 --> 00:50:59,318
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

1085
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,527
My sister and I
both thank you.

1086
00:51:00,611 --> 00:51:01,820
Would you like to say
a few words, sweetheart?

1087
00:51:01,904 --> 00:51:02,780
Yes.

1088
00:51:02,863 --> 00:51:04,907
Thank you. That's enough.

1089
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:06,950
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen,
for the piece de résistance.</i>

1090
00:51:07,034 --> 00:51:08,327
We're supposed
to add a new song

1091
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:09,370
to our act
for next season,

1092
00:51:09,453 --> 00:51:10,996
but the fella who was
supposed to sing it

1093
00:51:11,038 --> 00:51:12,289
got himself a new job.

1094
00:51:12,373 --> 00:51:14,708
It's not as much money
as we were paying him,

1095
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:15,959
but that's
what he wants to do,

1096
00:51:16,043 --> 00:51:19,254
so we're all for him.
Would you like to hear it?

1097
00:51:24,343 --> 00:51:25,844
Ladies and gentlemen,

1098
00:51:25,886 --> 00:51:28,639
your guest of honor,
Mr. Steven Donahue.

1099
00:51:30,557 --> 00:51:33,519
Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago,

1100
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,354
when we were
playing down in Memphis,

1101
00:51:35,437 --> 00:51:37,815
I heard a song
that impressed me very much,

1102
00:51:37,856 --> 00:51:39,483
and it's
the kind of a song

1103
00:51:39,566 --> 00:51:41,652
we snap our fingers
and clap our hands,

1104
00:51:41,735 --> 00:51:43,904
and I want you
to come along with me.

1105
00:51:43,988 --> 00:51:45,364
We'll have a little fun.

1106
00:51:45,447 --> 00:51:46,907
<i>Brothers</i>

1107
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:50,327
<i>And sisters</i>

1108
00:51:51,578 --> 00:51:53,038
<i>Listen</i>

1109
00:51:53,122 --> 00:51:55,791
<i>You nonbelievers, listen</i>

1110
00:51:55,874 --> 00:51:58,502
<i>You better
start to believe</i>

1111
00:51:58,544 --> 00:52:01,088
<i>All you doubters</i>

1112
00:52:01,171 --> 00:52:03,674
<i>Be hallelujah shouters</i>

1113
00:52:03,716 --> 00:52:06,635
<i>Or else
you're going to grieve</i>

1114
00:52:08,304 --> 00:52:13,058
<i>There's no time to wait</i>

1115
00:52:13,142 --> 00:52:18,397
<i>You may be too late</i>

1116
00:52:18,439 --> 00:52:20,733
<i>So listen</i>

1117
00:52:20,816 --> 00:52:23,736
<i>You don't know
what you're missin'</i>

1118
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:31,744
<i>Until you
start to believe</i>

1119
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:38,208
<i>If you believe</i>

1120
00:52:38,292 --> 00:52:42,254
<i>That there's a heaven</i>

1121
00:52:42,296 --> 00:52:45,758
<i>You'll get to heaven</i>

1122
00:52:45,799 --> 00:52:50,638
<i>If you believe</i>

1123
00:52:52,097 --> 00:52:58,437
<i>If you believe
that there are angels</i>

1124
00:52:58,479 --> 00:53:02,274
<i>You'll see the angels</i>

1125
00:53:02,358 --> 00:53:05,944
<i>If you believe</i>

1126
00:53:07,029 --> 00:53:11,825
<i>I'm not making promises</i>

1127
00:53:11,909 --> 00:53:19,708
<i>To the doubting Thomases</i>

1128
00:53:19,792 --> 00:53:27,925
<i>But if you believe
the Lord can help you</i>

1129
00:53:27,966 --> 00:53:33,806
<i>The Lord will help you</i>

1130
00:53:33,889 --> 00:53:40,604
<i>If you believe</i>

1131
00:53:40,646 --> 00:53:42,898
<i>Do you believe?</i>

1132
00:53:42,982 --> 00:53:43,983
<i>We do,
we do, we do</i>

1133
00:53:44,066 --> 00:53:45,275
<i>Do you believe?</i>

1134
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:46,652
<i>We do,
we do, we do</i>

1135
00:53:46,735 --> 00:53:49,697
<i>Well, Jonah went out
one night in a gale</i>

1136
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:50,739
<i>Do you believe that?</i>

1137
00:53:50,823 --> 00:53:52,741
<i>We do, we do, we do</i>

1138
00:53:52,825 --> 00:53:55,285
<i>Soon he was
swallowed up by a whale</i>

1139
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,704
<i>Do you believe that?</i>

1140
00:53:56,787 --> 00:53:58,372
<i>We do,
we do, we do</i>

1141
00:53:58,455 --> 00:54:00,916
<i>Daniel laid down
with lions that roared</i>

1142
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,836
<i>Noah was on his ark
when it poured</i>

1143
00:54:03,877 --> 00:54:06,213
<i>Moses looked up,
and he spoke to the Lord</i>

1144
00:54:06,296 --> 00:54:09,008
<i>Do you believe that?</i>

1145
00:54:09,091 --> 00:54:10,009
<i>We do</i>

1146
00:54:10,092 --> 00:54:11,510
<i>We do,
we do, we do</i>

1147
00:54:11,552 --> 00:54:19,226
<i>Now, I'm not making promises</i>

1148
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:29,028
<i>To the doubting Thomases</i>

1149
00:54:29,111 --> 00:54:37,619
<i>But if you believe
the Lord can help you</i>

1150
00:54:37,703 --> 00:54:45,961
<i>The Lord will help you</i>

1151
00:54:46,045 --> 00:54:58,390
<i>If you believe</i>

1152
00:54:58,474 --> 00:55:02,061
More! More!

1153
00:55:06,231 --> 00:55:07,691
Thank you very much.

1154
00:55:07,733 --> 00:55:10,569
I hope you won't take this
as my farewell performance.

1155
00:55:10,653 --> 00:55:13,280
I'm just going into rehearsal
now for four years,

1156
00:55:13,364 --> 00:55:15,407
and when I get
the new act put together...

1157
00:55:15,491 --> 00:55:18,369
New material, new costumes...
I hope you'll all

1158
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:20,204
find the time
to come and see me.

1159
00:55:20,245 --> 00:55:21,205
Will you?

1160
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:33,217
Steven: Thank you.

1161
00:55:33,258 --> 00:55:37,262
Woman: We're going
to miss you around here.

1162
00:55:38,597 --> 00:55:42,935
Somebody put a slice of
raw onion in this sandwich.

1163
00:55:43,018 --> 00:55:44,311
You better
give me a bite.

1164
00:55:44,395 --> 00:55:46,021
I need an excuse, too.

1165
00:55:50,776 --> 00:55:52,069
Florida.

1166
00:55:52,111 --> 00:55:55,239
We now take you
to beautiful Florida,

1167
00:55:55,322 --> 00:55:58,909
land of golden sunshine,
balmy breezes,

1168
00:55:58,993 --> 00:56:02,037
swaying palm trees.

1169
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:04,540
Playground
of the millionaires.

1170
00:56:04,581 --> 00:56:07,334
Yeah. Things
were going so swimmingly

1171
00:56:07,418 --> 00:56:08,711
for The Four Donahues,

1172
00:56:08,752 --> 00:56:11,046
one winter, we even
vacationed there.

1173
00:56:11,088 --> 00:56:12,464
Some vacation.

1174
00:56:12,548 --> 00:56:15,926
Two shows a night.
Three on Saturdays.

1175
00:56:21,473 --> 00:56:23,058
<i>Ta-da-da-da-da-ta</i>

1176
00:56:23,142 --> 00:56:25,436
<i>Tropical heat wave</i>

1177
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:26,437
<i>Da-da-da-da-ta</i>

1178
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,481
<i>Da-da-da-da-ta,
bum-bum</i>

1179
00:56:29,565 --> 00:56:31,191
Your aim's gettin' better.

1180
00:56:31,275 --> 00:56:32,568
I take it those
are the new costumes

1181
00:56:32,609 --> 00:56:33,569
<i>for the Heat Wave
number.</i>

1182
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:34,737
Yeah. Cuban. You like?

1183
00:56:34,778 --> 00:56:35,779
Yeah.

1184
00:56:35,821 --> 00:56:36,780
You better.
They cost a week's salary.

1185
00:56:36,822 --> 00:56:37,781
A week's salary?

1186
00:56:37,865 --> 00:56:39,199
If the number
doesn't go,

1187
00:56:39,283 --> 00:56:40,200
we can always
eat the act.

1188
00:56:40,284 --> 00:56:41,243
Take your hands away.

1189
00:56:41,285 --> 00:56:43,412
Those grapes cost
a dollar a piece.

1190
00:56:43,454 --> 00:56:45,539
<i>Muchachas, we are
in the wrong business.</i>

1191
00:56:45,622 --> 00:56:47,958
Oh, take the arrangements
down to the band

1192
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:48,959
and go over
the routine with them

1193
00:56:49,043 --> 00:56:49,960
before we rehearse.

1194
00:56:50,044 --> 00:56:50,961
OK, Mom.

1195
00:56:51,045 --> 00:56:53,047
If you see Katy,
send her in here.

1196
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:55,049
All right.

1197
00:56:59,637 --> 00:57:01,263
Conductor:
Hold it, fellas.

1198
00:57:01,305 --> 00:57:03,349
Mac, would mind trying
the vocal with me first?

1199
00:57:03,432 --> 00:57:05,517
Just easy, you know?
When the boys get here,

1200
00:57:05,601 --> 00:57:06,560
we can
take it from the top.

1201
00:57:06,644 --> 00:57:08,228
OK, honey. Let's try it.

1202
00:57:08,312 --> 00:57:09,480
Hi, Tim.

1203
00:57:09,563 --> 00:57:10,481
Hi.

1204
00:57:10,564 --> 00:57:12,316
Vicky, do you know
Tim Donahue?

1205
00:57:12,399 --> 00:57:13,942
Miss Vicky Parker.

1206
00:57:14,026 --> 00:57:16,153
Hello, Mr. Donahue.

1207
00:57:16,236 --> 00:57:18,322
Victoria Hoffman...
Gallagher's.

1208
00:57:18,405 --> 00:57:19,406
Right.

1209
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:21,325
But he said
Vicky Parker.

1210
00:57:21,367 --> 00:57:22,451
Don't tell me
you're married.

1211
00:57:22,534 --> 00:57:23,494
Don't tell me

1212
00:57:23,535 --> 00:57:25,329
this is going to be
another interview.

1213
00:57:25,412 --> 00:57:26,455
Are you?

1214
00:57:26,538 --> 00:57:28,624
Mac, did you know

1215
00:57:28,707 --> 00:57:30,167
that Mr. Donahue,
in his spare time,

1216
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:31,377
is a well-known
reporter?

1217
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,087
- Yeah.
- Are ya?

1218
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:35,839
No, Mr. Donahue.
I have a new manager,

1219
00:57:35,881 --> 00:57:37,341
and he's doing me
over completely.

1220
00:57:37,383 --> 00:57:40,761
New name, new clothes,
new, uh...

1221
00:57:40,844 --> 00:57:42,763
I guess everything else
is pretty much the same.

1222
00:57:42,846 --> 00:57:46,517
Yeah. But my
sensitive ear tells me

1223
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,769
that you're not using
quite as much diaphragm.

1224
00:57:48,852 --> 00:57:52,147
My vocal teacher
is gone with the wind,

1225
00:57:52,189 --> 00:57:54,024
and please
don't remind me.

1226
00:57:54,066 --> 00:57:56,610
Ah, dear. And I thought
this was just gonna be

1227
00:57:56,694 --> 00:57:57,903
another
nightclub engagement.

1228
00:58:02,199 --> 00:58:03,659
Thank you, fellas.

1229
00:58:03,742 --> 00:58:05,327
I couldn't have said it
any better myself.

1230
00:58:05,369 --> 00:58:07,204
Would you
mind terribly

1231
00:58:07,287 --> 00:58:08,580
if we got on
with the rehearsal?

1232
00:58:08,664 --> 00:58:10,124
Of course not.
You go right ahead.

1233
00:58:10,207 --> 00:58:11,625
I'll just sit right here
and watch you.

1234
00:58:11,709 --> 00:58:13,669
Help yourself.
Won't bother me.

1235
00:58:13,752 --> 00:58:15,504
It'll bother me,
but I like it.

1236
00:58:15,546 --> 00:58:16,714
OK, Mac.

1237
00:58:20,926 --> 00:58:23,887
<i>We're havin' a heat wave</i>

1238
00:58:26,223 --> 00:58:29,184
<i>A tropical heat wave</i>

1239
00:58:29,226 --> 00:58:32,146
<i>The temperature's rising,
it isn't surprising</i>

1240
00:58:32,229 --> 00:58:33,147
<i>She's certainly...</i>

1241
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:34,565
Hold it.
Wait a second.

1242
00:58:34,606 --> 00:58:36,608
Hold it, fellas. Hold it.

1243
00:58:36,692 --> 00:58:37,943
This is terrible.

1244
00:58:38,027 --> 00:58:38,944
Terrible?

1245
00:58:39,028 --> 00:58:40,821
No, you don't understand.

1246
00:58:40,904 --> 00:58:42,656
You can't
use that song.

1247
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,700
We're using it.
We have new costumes

1248
00:58:44,783 --> 00:58:46,618
and new arrangements.
Well, it's all set.

1249
00:58:46,702 --> 00:58:47,619
It's a big number.

1250
00:58:47,703 --> 00:58:48,704
You're joking.

1251
00:58:48,787 --> 00:58:50,080
I wish I was.

1252
00:58:50,164 --> 00:58:52,583
<i>But Heat Wave's
my big number, too.</i>

1253
00:58:52,624 --> 00:58:53,667
It is?

1254
00:58:53,751 --> 00:58:55,210
What are
we going to do?

1255
00:58:55,294 --> 00:58:57,004
My whole act's
built around it.

1256
00:58:57,087 --> 00:58:59,465
I have boys
working with me...

1257
00:58:59,548 --> 00:59:01,091
but of course,

1258
00:59:01,175 --> 00:59:02,343
you're the headliners,

1259
00:59:02,426 --> 00:59:04,053
so I guess it's out.

1260
00:59:04,094 --> 00:59:05,596
I'll just have to cancel

1261
00:59:05,638 --> 00:59:06,722
and go back
to New York.

1262
00:59:06,764 --> 00:59:09,767
No, you can't do that.
What about us?

1263
00:59:09,808 --> 00:59:11,185
What about all the things
we're gonna do together?

1264
00:59:11,268 --> 00:59:13,187
But, Tim,
what else can I do?

1265
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:15,230
It puts me
in a terrible spot.

1266
00:59:15,272 --> 00:59:16,565
Well...

1267
00:59:19,151 --> 00:59:20,944
I'll tell you what,
forget about it.

1268
00:59:21,028 --> 00:59:22,404
Forget the whole thing.
You go right ahead.

1269
00:59:22,446 --> 00:59:25,074
It's your number. There are
lots of things we can do.

1270
00:59:25,115 --> 00:59:26,950
We'll work something out.
I'll go talk to the family.

1271
00:59:27,034 --> 00:59:28,410
I'll see you later.

1272
00:59:28,452 --> 00:59:30,663
I hope so.
And thank you.

1273
00:59:30,746 --> 00:59:32,665
Yeah.
I'll see you later.

1274
00:59:38,003 --> 00:59:40,506
Whew. That was close.
He had me worried.

1275
00:59:40,589 --> 00:59:42,549
Not me. I never had
a moment's doubt.

1276
00:59:42,633 --> 00:59:45,552
Gentlemen, the winner
and new champion.

1277
01:00:13,455 --> 01:00:14,581
Wow!

1278
01:00:15,791 --> 01:00:18,002
<i>We're havin' a heat wave</i>

1279
01:00:18,043 --> 01:00:20,337
<i>A tropical heat wave</i>

1280
01:00:20,379 --> 01:00:22,589
<i>The temperature's rising,
it isn't surprising</i>

1281
01:00:22,673 --> 01:00:24,299
<i>She certainly can</i>

1282
01:00:24,383 --> 01:00:25,342
<i>Can-can</i>

1283
01:00:27,011 --> 01:00:29,138
<i>She started a heat wave</i>

1284
01:00:29,179 --> 01:00:31,432
<i>By letting her seat wave</i>

1285
01:00:31,515 --> 01:00:33,642
<i>In such a way that
the customers say that</i>

1286
01:00:33,684 --> 01:00:35,019
<i>She certainly can</i>

1287
01:00:35,102 --> 01:00:36,020
<i>Can-can</i>

1288
01:00:36,103 --> 01:00:37,438
<i>Gee, gee</i>

1289
01:00:37,521 --> 01:00:39,315
<i>Her anatomy</i>

1290
01:00:39,356 --> 01:00:41,442
<i>Makes the mercury</i>

1291
01:00:41,525 --> 01:00:42,484
<i>Zoom</i>

1292
01:00:42,526 --> 01:00:44,528
<i>To 93</i>

1293
01:00:45,988 --> 01:00:48,490
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

1294
01:00:48,574 --> 01:00:50,617
<i>We're havin' a heat wave</i>

1295
01:00:50,701 --> 01:00:52,745
<i>A tropical heat wave</i>

1296
01:00:52,828 --> 01:00:54,663
<i>The way that she moves
that thermometer proves</i>

1297
01:00:54,705 --> 01:00:55,789
<i>That she certainly can</i>

1298
01:00:55,873 --> 01:00:57,333
What's your name, honey?

1299
01:00:57,416 --> 01:00:58,375
Pablo.

1300
01:00:58,417 --> 01:00:59,501
<i>Certainly can</i>

1301
01:00:59,543 --> 01:01:00,502
Chico.

1302
01:01:00,544 --> 01:01:01,670
<i>Certainly can</i>

1303
01:01:01,754 --> 01:01:02,713
Miguelito.

1304
01:01:04,715 --> 01:01:05,758

1305
01:01:05,841 --> 01:01:06,884

<i>Miguelito</i>

1307
01:01:10,304 --> 01:01:12,306
<i>Ahh! Can-can</i>

1308
01:01:37,873 --> 01:01:39,583
<i>Pablo</i>

01:01:39,667 --> 01:01:40,834

<i>Where?</i>

1314
01:01:50,594 --> 01:01:51,720
<i>Jamaica</i>

1315
01:01:51,804 --> 01:01:53,347
<i>Moderately high
barometric pressure</i>

1316
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:55,683
<i>Will cover
the, uh, Northeast and</i>

1317
01:01:55,766 --> 01:01:56,684
<i>Where else?</i>

1318
01:01:56,767 --> 01:01:58,560
<i>The deep South</i>

1319
01:01:58,602 --> 01:01:59,645
<i>Small danger of</i>

1320
01:01:59,728 --> 01:02:00,646
<i>What?</i>

1321
01:02:00,729 --> 01:02:01,939
<i>Fruit frost</i>

1322
01:02:01,981 --> 01:02:05,025
<i>Hot and humid nights
can be expected</i>

1323
01:02:05,109 --> 01:02:06,735

<i>A tropical</i>

<i>Heat wave</i>

01:02:25,462 --> 01:02:28,298
<i>The temperature's rising</i>

1332
01:02:28,382 --> 01:02:30,801
<i>It isn't surprising</i>

1333
01:02:30,843 --> 01:02:32,886
<i>He certainly can</i>

1334
01:02:34,888 --> 01:02:35,806
<i>Can</i>

1335
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:41,478
<i>I started this heat wave</i>

1336
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,479
<i>By</i>

1337
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:46,692
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1338
01:02:46,775 --> 01:02:49,111
<i>And in such a way that</i>

1339
01:02:49,153 --> 01:02:52,072
<i>The customers say that</i>

1340
01:02:52,156 --> 01:02:54,283
<i>I certainly can</i>

<i>Can-can</i>

01:02:55,284 --> 01:03:00,914
<i>Gee, gee, gee...</i>

1343
01:03:00,998 --> 01:03:02,708
It's easy to see
why he did it.

1344
01:03:02,791 --> 01:03:03,709
Ow!

1345
01:03:03,792 --> 01:03:08,005
<i>Makes the mercury</i>

1346
01:03:08,047 --> 01:03:10,341
<i>Rise to</i>

1347
01:03:10,382 --> 01:03:12,343
<i>93</i>

1348
01:03:14,803 --> 01:03:19,099
<i>We're havin' a heat wave</i>

1349
01:03:19,183 --> 01:03:23,646
<i>A tropical, tropical
heat wave</i>

1350
01:03:23,729 --> 01:03:27,983
<i>The way that I move
that thermometer proves</i>

1351
01:03:28,025 --> 01:03:29,193
<i>She certainly</i>

1352
01:03:29,276 --> 01:03:32,071
<i>Certainly,
certainly can</i>

1353
01:03:32,154 --> 01:03:36,241
<i>I certainly, certainly,
certainly can</i>

1354
01:03:41,121 --> 01:03:45,918
<i>Can-can</i>

1355
01:03:55,010 --> 01:03:56,887
Yeah? Then
what happened?

1356
01:03:56,971 --> 01:03:59,390
Then after Lew Harris bought
my contract from Eddie,

1357
01:03:59,473 --> 01:04:01,600
he sent me out on the road
for a few seasons.

1358
01:04:01,684 --> 01:04:03,519
He told me I had
an awful lot to learn

1359
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,188
and I talked as if I had
marshmallows in my mouth.

1360
01:04:06,271 --> 01:04:08,524
Ha. I liked it.
It was different.

1361
01:04:08,565 --> 01:04:10,275
Yes, like green hair.

1362
01:04:10,359 --> 01:04:13,028
Yeah.

1363
01:04:13,112 --> 01:04:14,321
It's lovely.

1364
01:04:14,405 --> 01:04:15,322
You know,

1365
01:04:15,406 --> 01:04:17,366
I never thought
anything like this

1366
01:04:17,408 --> 01:04:18,951
could ever happen
to me.

1367
01:04:19,034 --> 01:04:20,411
Well, anyway...

1368
01:04:20,494 --> 01:04:22,705
I guess Lew thinks
I'm ready now.

1369
01:04:22,746 --> 01:04:24,373
He's planning to build
a whole new revue

1370
01:04:24,415 --> 01:04:25,791
around me next season
on Broadway.

1371
01:04:25,874 --> 01:04:28,043
I'd like to build
something around you:

1372
01:04:28,127 --> 01:04:29,586
A barbed-wire fence.

1373
01:04:29,628 --> 01:04:30,796
Where do you think

1374
01:04:30,879 --> 01:04:32,214
we should go
on our honeymoon?

1375
01:04:32,256 --> 01:04:33,215
What?

1376
01:04:33,257 --> 01:04:35,301
I think we oughta
stay right here.

1377
01:04:35,384 --> 01:04:36,760
Then we wouldn't waste
all that time traveling,

1378
01:04:36,844 --> 01:04:37,845
and, besides,

1379
01:04:37,928 --> 01:04:40,639
they tell me the rainy
season's coming on.

1380
01:04:42,057 --> 01:04:43,726
I really have to go, Tim.

1381
01:04:43,767 --> 01:04:44,768
It's getting late.

1382
01:04:44,852 --> 01:04:46,270
Why don't we get
a sandwich at the hotel?

1383
01:04:46,353 --> 01:04:47,354
I'm hungry.

1384
01:04:47,438 --> 01:04:49,189
We just had spaghetti
at the other place.

1385
01:04:49,273 --> 01:04:51,191
You bought me
breadsticks, remember?

1386
01:04:51,275 --> 01:04:53,110
Huh? Yeah. I forgot.

1387
01:04:53,152 --> 01:04:55,446
Well, when we're married,
we won't eat out.

1388
01:04:55,487 --> 01:04:56,947
We'll bake
our own breadsticks.

1389
01:04:57,031 --> 01:04:58,157
Grow our own wheat?

1390
01:04:58,240 --> 01:05:00,909
Sure. With a large family,
you gotta cut corners.

1391
01:05:00,993 --> 01:05:02,953
Just how large a family
are you planning?

1392
01:05:03,037 --> 01:05:05,456
Oh, quartet:
Baritone, tenor,

1393
01:05:05,539 --> 01:05:06,790
soprano, alto.

1394
01:05:06,874 --> 01:05:08,792
You like the script so far?

1395
01:05:08,876 --> 01:05:11,086
You left out
a very important part:

1396
01:05:11,128 --> 01:05:12,087
The menace.

1397
01:05:12,129 --> 01:05:13,213
Oh, we don't need one.

1398
01:05:13,297 --> 01:05:15,674
We'll keep it
light and airy.

1399
01:05:15,758 --> 01:05:17,551
What if your heroine
is a career woman,

1400
01:05:17,635 --> 01:05:20,095
gonna fight her way to
the top, no matter what?

1401
01:05:20,179 --> 01:05:21,722
Then I'll clear
the path for her.

1402
01:05:21,805 --> 01:05:22,723
Why, I'm...

1403
01:05:22,806 --> 01:05:24,892
trustworthy,
loyal, helpful,

1404
01:05:24,975 --> 01:05:26,935
friendly, courteous,
kind, obedient,

1405
01:05:26,977 --> 01:05:27,936
cheerful, thrifty,

1406
01:05:27,978 --> 01:05:29,605
brave, clean,
and reverent,

1407
01:05:29,647 --> 01:05:31,607
and we could
start a fire

1408
01:05:31,649 --> 01:05:33,067
without rubbing
two sticks together.

1409
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:35,235
What do you say, baby?

1410
01:05:35,319 --> 01:05:37,154
Don't call us.
We'll call you.

1411
01:05:39,907 --> 01:05:41,700
Good night, Tim.

1412
01:05:41,784 --> 01:05:43,702
Is that all?

1413
01:05:43,786 --> 01:05:44,703
Good night.

1414
01:06:05,015 --> 01:06:07,434
Oh, I forgot to return
your breadstick.

1415
01:06:07,518 --> 01:06:08,936
I'm awfully sorry.

1416
01:06:09,019 --> 01:06:10,521
I'll forgive you.

1417
01:06:10,604 --> 01:06:11,563
Good night.

1418
01:06:11,647 --> 01:06:14,066
Is that still all?

1419
01:06:14,149 --> 01:06:15,567
Tim, I had
a wonderful evening.

1420
01:06:15,651 --> 01:06:17,069
I like you very much.

1421
01:06:17,152 --> 01:06:19,321
I hope you ask me out
again sometime.

1422
01:06:19,405 --> 01:06:21,156
And if you want
to kiss me good night...

1423
01:06:21,198 --> 01:06:22,157
Mm-hmm.

1424
01:06:27,705 --> 01:06:28,622
Good night.

1425
01:06:47,808 --> 01:06:51,228
<i>A man chases a girl</i>

1426
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:53,689
<i>Until she catches him</i>

1427
01:06:55,816 --> 01:06:59,236
<i>He runs after a girl</i>

1428
01:06:59,278 --> 01:07:00,738
<i>Until he's caught</i>

1429
01:07:02,656 --> 01:07:05,326
<i>He fishes for a girl</i>

1430
01:07:05,409 --> 01:07:07,870
<i>Until she's landed him</i>

1431
01:07:09,413 --> 01:07:13,375
<i>It all comes out exactly
the way she thought</i>

1432
01:07:15,419 --> 01:07:18,547
<i>Uncertain</i>

1433
01:07:18,589 --> 01:07:21,884
<i>He tags along behind</i>

1434
01:07:21,925 --> 01:07:24,845
<i>Uncertain</i>

1435
01:07:24,928 --> 01:07:28,098
<i>Till she
makes up his mind</i>

1436
01:07:28,182 --> 01:07:34,897
<i>A man chases a girl
until she catches him</i>

1437
01:07:34,938 --> 01:07:41,070
<i>But don't run too fast
while you are saying no</i>

1438
01:07:41,111 --> 01:07:42,946
<i>And once
you've caught him</i>

1439
01:07:42,988 --> 01:07:45,741
<i>Don't ever let him go</i>

1440
01:08:23,028 --> 01:08:25,990
<i>A man chases a girl</i>

1441
01:08:26,031 --> 01:08:28,909

1446
01:08:44,466 --> 01:08:46,927
<i>It all comes out</i>

1447
01:08:47,011 --> 01:08:49,555
<i>Exactly the way
she thought</i>

1448
01:10:17,893 --> 01:10:20,187
<i>Once you've got him</i>

1449
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:23,899

<i>Don't let him go</i>

1454
01:11:53,113 --> 01:11:56,033
"Well, Mom, Latin and I are
finally on speaking terms,

1455
01:11:56,116 --> 01:11:57,201
"and I am not as worried

1456
01:11:57,284 --> 01:11:58,827
"about the final
examinations now

1457
01:11:58,911 --> 01:12:00,287
"as I was a month ago.

1458
01:12:00,371 --> 01:12:03,165
"However, I'll be grateful
for all the help I can get,

1459
01:12:03,207 --> 01:12:04,917
"so please light
a candle for me.

"Please light
four candles for me.

<i>"Pax vobiscum.</i>

<i>That's Latin
for "peace be with you."</i>

1465
01:12:14,218 --> 01:12:15,177
Let me see that.

1466
01:12:15,219 --> 01:12:16,553
You know, it
wouldn't surprise me

1467
01:12:16,637 --> 01:12:18,055
if he was top man
in his class.

1468
01:12:18,138 --> 01:12:19,139
Morning, Pop.

1469
01:12:19,223 --> 01:12:20,766
Morning, Mom.

1470
01:12:20,849 --> 01:12:21,767
Would you like

1471
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:23,644
to try
that entrance again?

1472
01:12:23,727 --> 01:12:24,645
See, I'm your father.

1473
01:12:24,728 --> 01:12:25,771
This lady happens
to be your mother.

1474
01:12:25,854 --> 01:12:26,897
Leave him alone, Terry.

1475
01:12:26,981 --> 01:12:29,149
He hasn't got anything
straight for two weeks.

1476
01:12:29,233 --> 01:12:31,151
Why should he start now?

1477
01:12:31,235 --> 01:12:32,152
What's up?

1478
01:12:32,236 --> 01:12:34,363
Let him eat.
He needs his strength.

1479
01:12:35,739 --> 01:12:37,074
I'll get it.

1480
01:12:40,077 --> 01:12:41,036
Hello.

1481
01:12:41,078 --> 01:12:43,622
Yes, he's here.

1482
01:12:43,706 --> 01:12:45,624
That girl who steals
everybody's material

1483
01:12:45,708 --> 01:12:46,875
wants to talk to you.

1484
01:12:46,917 --> 01:12:48,210
Shh!

1485
01:12:48,252 --> 01:12:49,253
She'll hear you.

1486
01:12:49,294 --> 01:12:52,006
Good. Maybe she'll
give me back my song.

1487
01:12:53,882 --> 01:12:54,800
Hello, Vicky.

1488
01:12:54,883 --> 01:12:56,218
How are you
this morning?

1489
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:57,720
Hmm?

1490
01:12:57,761 --> 01:12:59,388
Yeah, it's me.

1491
01:12:59,430 --> 01:13:01,265
No, really.

1492
01:13:01,348 --> 01:13:02,766
No... no... no... no,

1493
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:03,767
there's
nothing wrong.

1494
01:13:03,851 --> 01:13:05,311
It's just... yeah.

1495
01:13:05,394 --> 01:13:06,395
Yeah, capacity.

1496
01:13:06,437 --> 01:13:07,896
Standing room only.

1497
01:13:10,107 --> 01:13:12,067
No, I haven't
had a chance

1498
01:13:12,109 --> 01:13:13,861
to tell them yet.
I... I... I...

1499
01:13:13,944 --> 01:13:14,862
Excuse me.

1500
01:13:14,945 --> 01:13:16,071
Wait just a minute,
will ya, Vicky?

1501
01:13:16,113 --> 01:13:17,573
Excuse me, Mother.

1502
01:13:19,616 --> 01:13:21,076
Uh, excuse me.

1503
01:13:24,455 --> 01:13:26,373
You know something?
I think they're married.

1504
01:13:26,457 --> 01:13:27,416
Married? Who?

1505
01:13:27,499 --> 01:13:28,959
Tim and that girl.
Didn't you hear him?

1506
01:13:29,043 --> 01:13:30,127
"I haven't had a chance
to tell them yet."

1507
01:13:30,210 --> 01:13:31,128
What else could it be?

1508
01:13:31,211 --> 01:13:32,171
No, no, no.

1509
01:13:32,254 --> 01:13:33,839
What do you mean,
"no, no, no"?

1510
01:13:33,922 --> 01:13:35,090
Of course that's
what it is.

1511
01:13:35,174 --> 01:13:36,133
What are we gonna do?

1512
01:13:36,216 --> 01:13:37,343
They're not married.

1513
01:13:37,384 --> 01:13:38,344
Then they're making plans.

1514
01:13:38,385 --> 01:13:39,887
You've gotta step 'em,
Terry.

1515
01:13:39,970 --> 01:13:40,888
Me?

1516
01:13:40,971 --> 01:13:41,889
Certainly. You run this act.

1517
01:13:41,972 --> 01:13:42,973
Ha! All of a sudden,

1518
01:13:43,057 --> 01:13:44,391
when something goes
wrong, I run the act.

1519
01:13:44,475 --> 01:13:45,768
Don't raise your voice
to me!

1520
01:13:45,851 --> 01:13:46,769
What do you
think you are,

1521
01:13:46,852 --> 01:13:47,770
Whispering
Jack Smith?

1522
01:13:48,854 --> 01:13:49,772
Come in.

1523
01:13:51,148 --> 01:13:53,192
Oh, it's love's
young dream.

1524
01:13:53,233 --> 01:13:54,693
He locked himself in.

1525
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:01,408
There's no knob
on the inside.

1526
01:14:01,492 --> 01:14:03,994
I'll complain
to the management.

1527
01:14:04,078 --> 01:14:07,164
Tell them and get it
over with, will ya?

1528
01:14:07,247 --> 01:14:08,916
OK.

1529
01:14:08,999 --> 01:14:11,043
Uh, Mom, Pop...

1530
01:14:11,126 --> 01:14:13,837
uh, Katy and me,
we, uh...

1531
01:14:13,921 --> 01:14:15,381
Well, me and Katy...

1532
01:14:15,422 --> 01:14:16,590
Oh, for heaven's sakes.

1533
01:14:16,674 --> 01:14:18,467
Lew Harris is going
to star Vicky Parker

1534
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:20,302
in a big Broadway revue
next season...

1535
01:14:20,386 --> 01:14:21,637
I got a great title
for it:

1536
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,639
<i>Something Borrowed
And Something Blue.</i>

1537
01:14:23,722 --> 01:14:25,349
Now, come on, Mom.
Let Katy tell you, will ya?

1538
01:14:25,432 --> 01:14:26,809
Well, Vicky wants
Tim and me

1539
01:14:26,892 --> 01:14:28,227
to be in the show
with her,

1540
01:14:28,268 --> 01:14:29,228
so she asked Mr. Harris

1541
01:14:29,269 --> 01:14:30,396
to catch the act
last night,

1542
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:31,730
and he liked us,

1543
01:14:31,814 --> 01:14:33,148
so he wants to sign us.

1544
01:14:33,232 --> 01:14:36,151
And the question is,
should we or...

1545
01:14:36,235 --> 01:14:37,569
or shouldn't we do it?

1546
01:14:40,072 --> 01:14:43,409
First she takes our song,
and now...

1547
01:14:43,492 --> 01:14:44,952
Oh, this kid and I

1548
01:14:44,994 --> 01:14:48,163
have just gotta wind up
the best of chums.

1549
01:14:48,247 --> 01:14:49,707
Well, I think
it's great.

1550
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:52,001
I think it's
just wonderful.

1551
01:14:52,084 --> 01:14:54,545
Now, you understand
it's just Katy and me.

1552
01:14:54,628 --> 01:14:56,672
That's why we didn't
say anything definite.

1553
01:14:56,755 --> 01:14:58,465
Are you worrying about
your mother and me?

1554
01:14:58,549 --> 01:14:59,717
Young lady,
we were an act

1555
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:01,552
before you
were an idea.

1556
01:15:01,635 --> 01:15:04,221
And you, you weren't
even penciled in.

1557
01:15:04,305 --> 01:15:05,848
What do you think
we raised you for

1558
01:15:05,931 --> 01:15:07,349
if it wasn't for this?

1559
01:15:07,433 --> 01:15:09,268
What do you say, Mom?

1560
01:15:10,811 --> 01:15:11,770
OK.

1561
01:15:13,147 --> 01:15:14,606
On one condition.

1562
01:15:14,648 --> 01:15:17,276
They have to take
the four Cuban costumes, too.

1563
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:19,194
Molly, I love you.

1601
01:16:54,081 --> 01:16:55,040
<i>She's languid</i>

1602
01:16:55,082 --> 01:16:56,208
<i>Shh, quiet</i>

1603
01:16:56,291 --> 01:16:57,751
<i>Bill? Bobby? Bruce?</i>

1604
01:16:57,835 --> 01:16:59,670
<i>No, it's just
that I'm supine</i>

1605
01:16:59,753 --> 01:17:00,671
That's a word?

1606
01:17:00,754 --> 01:17:01,880
Who knows?

1607
01:17:01,964 --> 01:17:03,465
<i>Physically,
I'm in pretty good shape</i>

1608
01:17:03,549 --> 01:17:05,217
<i>See? She did
say it again</i>

1609
01:17:05,301 --> 01:17:07,219
<i>But, mentally,
I'm comatose</i>

1610
01:17:07,261 --> 01:17:08,971
<i>Quick, boy,
the dictionary</i>

1611
01:17:09,054 --> 01:17:11,015
<i>You know you're
the only one I love</i>

1612
01:17:11,098 --> 01:17:12,766
<i>New fish,
same hook</i>

1613
01:17:12,850 --> 01:17:13,767
<i>Bye, now</i>

1614
01:17:14,852 --> 01:17:15,769
<i>Bye, now</i>

1615
01:17:24,111 --> 01:17:25,904
<i>She won't get up,
she won't go out</i>

1616
01:17:25,988 --> 01:17:27,948
<i>Baby,
what's it all about?</i>

1617
01:17:28,032 --> 01:17:31,243
<i>Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why?</i>

1618
01:17:31,327 --> 01:17:34,121
Well, in simple
English, I'm...

1619
01:17:34,204 --> 01:17:37,666
<i>Lazy</i>

1620
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:40,836
<i>I wanna be</i>

1621
01:17:40,919 --> 01:17:43,464
<i>Lazy</i>

1622
01:17:43,547 --> 01:17:46,216
<i>I long to be</i>

1623
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:50,346
<i>Out in the sun</i>

1624
01:17:50,429 --> 01:17:55,476
<i>With no work
to be done</i>

1625
01:17:55,559 --> 01:18:00,439
<i>Under that awning</i>

1626
01:18:00,481 --> 01:18:05,944
<i>They call the sky</i>

1627
01:18:06,028 --> 01:18:11,825
<i>Stretching and yawning</i>

1628
01:18:11,909 --> 01:18:15,287
<i>And let the world</i>

1629
01:18:15,329 --> 01:18:18,874
<i>Go drifting by</i>

1630
01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:21,293
<i>I wanna peep</i>

1631
01:18:21,377 --> 01:18:24,296
<i>Through the deep</i>

1632
01:18:24,338 --> 01:18:28,759
<i>Tangled wide world</i>

1633
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:33,305
<i>Counting sheep</i>

1634
01:18:33,389 --> 01:18:36,642
<i>Till I sleep</i>

1635
01:18:36,725 --> 01:18:42,439
<i>Like a child would</i>

1636
01:18:42,523 --> 01:18:49,071
<i>With a great big
valise full</i>

1637
01:18:49,154 --> 01:18:52,533
<i>Of books to read</i>

1638
01:18:52,616 --> 01:18:57,204
<i>Where it's peaceful</i>

1639
01:18:57,287 --> 01:18:59,790
<i>While I'm</i>

1640
01:18:59,873 --> 01:19:02,876
<i>Killin' time</i>

1641
01:19:02,918 --> 01:19:07,006
<i>Being lazy</i>

1642
01:19:23,981 --> 01:19:25,149
Wrong number.

1643
01:19:28,694 --> 01:19:29,737
Wrong number.

1644
01:19:38,871 --> 01:19:39,788
Oh, Sam,
you're sweet.

1645
01:19:39,872 --> 01:19:40,831
Aah!

1646
01:19:58,599 --> 01:20:00,017
Lew, I did
that lyric over.

1647
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:01,518
You want to look at it?

1648
01:20:01,602 --> 01:20:03,145
Oh, thanks, Charlie.

1649
01:20:03,228 --> 01:20:06,148
That boy and girl are
just what Vicky needed.

1650
01:20:06,231 --> 01:20:07,566
They make her look great.

1651
01:20:07,650 --> 01:20:09,777
Yeah, they sure do.

1652
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:11,278
You know something, Lew?

1653
01:20:11,362 --> 01:20:14,365
I think I'm gonna
marry that girl.

1654
01:20:14,448 --> 01:20:15,574
You what?

1655
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,076
Don't get nervous.

1656
01:20:17,117 --> 01:20:18,577
I mean
the little Donahue.

1657
01:20:18,619 --> 01:20:19,620
Oh.

1658
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:39,765
<i>With a great big</i>

1659
01:20:39,807 --> 01:20:43,102
<i>Valise full</i>

1660
01:20:43,143 --> 01:20:47,356
<i>Of books to read</i>

1661
01:20:47,439 --> 01:20:52,569
<i>Where it's peaceful</i>

1662
01:20:52,653 --> 01:20:55,406
<i>While I'm</i>

1663
01:20:55,489 --> 01:20:59,576
<i>Killin' time</i>

1664
01:20:59,660 --> 01:21:02,579
<i>Being</i>

1665
01:21:02,663 --> 01:21:09,586
<i>Lazy</i>

1666
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:21,140
That's fine, kids.
Very good. Keep it that way.

1667
01:21:21,223 --> 01:21:22,141
Let's go to lunch.

1668
01:21:22,224 --> 01:21:23,267
OK, kids, that's it.

1669
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:25,227
Lunch, everybody.
Back at 2:00 sharp.

1670
01:21:25,311 --> 01:21:26,645
I'm starved.
I'll get my coat

1671
01:21:26,687 --> 01:21:27,938
and be with you
in two minutes.

1672
01:21:28,022 --> 01:21:28,939
All right.

1673
01:21:29,023 --> 01:21:30,441
Tim, toward the finish

1674
01:21:30,524 --> 01:21:32,526
where I slide over
the end of the couch,

1675
01:21:32,609 --> 01:21:34,445
am I too close to you?

1676
01:21:34,528 --> 01:21:36,488
Can the bee get too close
to the honey?

1677
01:21:36,572 --> 01:21:37,531
Come on.
Let's go to lunch.

1678
01:21:37,614 --> 01:21:39,616
Vicky, I have lunch
sent upstairs for us.

1679
01:21:39,700 --> 01:21:41,493
I think that'll
be less tiring for you.

1680
01:21:41,535 --> 01:21:42,619
We can't take
any chances

1681
01:21:42,703 --> 01:21:43,746
with our star,
you know?

1682
01:21:43,829 --> 01:21:45,205
Can I have
a rain check, Tim?

1683
01:21:45,289 --> 01:21:46,206
Maybe tomorrow, huh?

1684
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:47,416
That dance looked great.

1685
01:21:47,499 --> 01:21:48,667
Nice work, boy.

1686
01:21:51,545 --> 01:21:54,131
Boy, you can
take me to lunch.

1687
01:21:56,008 --> 01:21:56,967
Come on.

1688
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:00,220
Oh, by the way,
I fixed it.

1689
01:22:00,262 --> 01:22:01,180
We've got Friday off.

1690
01:22:01,263 --> 01:22:03,015
Yeah? Where are we going?

1691
01:22:03,098 --> 01:22:05,059
To church.
Steve is being ordained.

1692
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,061
How could you
forget that?

1693
01:22:07,102 --> 01:22:08,520
Honestly, Tim,
don't you think

1694
01:22:08,604 --> 01:22:11,023
about anything these days
but Vicky Parker?

1695
01:22:11,106 --> 01:22:12,024
No.

1696
01:22:12,107 --> 01:22:13,317
Charlie: Miss Donahue.

1697
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:14,318
Oh, hello.

1698
01:22:14,401 --> 01:22:15,819
Excuse me.
I was just wondering

1699
01:22:15,903 --> 01:22:17,196
if you were free
for lunch.

1700
01:22:17,237 --> 01:22:18,781
Well, um...

1701
01:22:18,864 --> 01:22:20,616
Oh, don't worry
about me, Sis.

1702
01:22:20,699 --> 01:22:21,617
Of course,
I'm not sincere,

1703
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:23,077
but would you
like to join us?

1704
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:24,578
Well, thanks,
but I'll send out

1705
01:22:24,662 --> 01:22:26,121
for a sandwich.
You go ahead.

1706
01:22:26,205 --> 01:22:27,706
Be sure and eat, now.

1707
01:22:27,790 --> 01:22:29,667
You really looked like you
were enjoying that number.

1708
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:31,168
Katy: I love it.

1709
01:23:21,302 --> 01:23:23,929
But when I got up
to the altar,

1710
01:23:24,013 --> 01:23:25,472
I was real scared.

1711
01:23:25,514 --> 01:23:27,891
The ordaining was
so beautiful, Steve.

1712
01:23:27,975 --> 01:23:29,143
Father Donahue.

1713
01:23:29,226 --> 01:23:31,145
Hey, you know where
your parish will be?

1714
01:23:31,186 --> 01:23:32,438
I haven't been
assigned yet.

1715
01:23:32,479 --> 01:23:34,440
You make sure they give
you a good booking, son.

1716
01:23:34,481 --> 01:23:36,525
Don't let them put you
out in the sticks.

1717
01:23:36,608 --> 01:23:38,610
Oh, Charlie,
I'm sorry.

1718
01:23:38,652 --> 01:23:40,612
Steve, you haven't
met Charlie Gibbs.

1719
01:23:40,654 --> 01:23:43,115
Charlie, may I present
Father Steven Donahue?

1720
01:23:43,157 --> 01:23:44,158
Glad to meet you,
Charlie.

1721
01:23:44,199 --> 01:23:45,159
Congratulations,
Father.

1722
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:46,160
Thank you.

1723
01:23:46,201 --> 01:23:47,661
Look, I know
this is family,

1724
01:23:47,703 --> 01:23:49,204
and I kind of hate
to butt in,

1725
01:23:49,288 --> 01:23:50,789
but I was wondering
if you'd have any time

1726
01:23:50,873 --> 01:23:52,041
in the near future

1727
01:23:52,124 --> 01:23:53,250
to perform a small
wedding ceremony.

1728
01:23:53,334 --> 01:23:54,251
A wedding ceremony?

1729
01:23:54,335 --> 01:23:55,252
That's right.

1730
01:23:55,336 --> 01:23:56,837
Who are you
gonna marry, Charlie?

1731
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,630
You.

1732
01:23:58,714 --> 01:23:59,673
What is this?

1733
01:23:59,715 --> 01:24:00,841
When did
all this happen?

1734
01:24:00,924 --> 01:24:02,343
It's the first
I've heard of it.

1735
01:24:02,426 --> 01:24:05,846
It's the first I've
heard of it, too. Charlie.

1736
01:24:05,929 --> 01:24:08,474
Well, it looks like it's
my turn to congratulate you.

1737
01:24:08,557 --> 01:24:10,351
I'll be happy
to perform the ceremony.

1738
01:24:10,392 --> 01:24:11,352
Thanks, Father.

1739
01:24:11,435 --> 01:24:13,103
Wherever you are,
whenever you're ready,

1740
01:24:13,187 --> 01:24:14,521
just give me a call.

1741
01:24:14,605 --> 01:24:16,523
Have black suit,
will travel.

1742
01:24:16,607 --> 01:24:18,233
I think I oughta
congratulate him, too.

1743
01:24:18,317 --> 01:24:19,860
I'm gonna give
the bride away.

1744
01:24:26,450 --> 01:24:27,368
Vicky: Tim?

1745
01:24:27,451 --> 01:24:28,369
Yeah. Ready?

1746
01:24:29,787 --> 01:24:30,996
I have the evening
all planned.

1747
01:24:31,038 --> 01:24:32,414
Dinner at Shambor.

1748
01:24:32,498 --> 01:24:34,375
Pheasant under glass,
broccoli hollandaise.

1749
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:35,376
Not for me.

1750
01:24:35,459 --> 01:24:37,503
I'm a simple girl
with simple tastes.

1751
01:24:37,586 --> 01:24:39,129
2-inch-thick steaks,
French fries,

1752
01:24:39,213 --> 01:24:40,130
and a big salad.

1753
01:24:40,214 --> 01:24:42,091
Then steak it'll be.
Hitch on.

1754
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:46,178
Nellie, what is that?

1755
01:24:46,261 --> 01:24:47,221
That's not for me.

1756
01:24:47,304 --> 01:24:48,347
Well, yes, Miss Parker.

1757
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:49,890
It's the first dress
you wear.

1758
01:24:49,974 --> 01:24:51,266
But I understood
it was out.

1759
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:52,267
Well, I don't know.

1760
01:24:52,351 --> 01:24:53,352
Mr. Harris put it through.

1761
01:24:53,435 --> 01:24:54,520
He wants to see it

1762
01:24:54,603 --> 01:24:55,813
in his office right now.

1763
01:24:55,896 --> 01:24:58,607
Then I have to see him
right now. Thanks, Millie.

1764
01:24:58,691 --> 01:24:59,692
Hey, Vicky.

1765
01:24:59,733 --> 01:25:01,360
Steak, French fries,
you and me, remember?

1766
01:25:01,402 --> 01:25:02,403
You go ahead, Tim.

1767
01:25:02,444 --> 01:25:03,529
I thought
I'd convinced Lew

1768
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:04,738
this dress
is wrong for me,

1769
01:25:04,822 --> 01:25:06,740
but I guess I'll have
to persuade him again.

1770
01:25:06,824 --> 01:25:07,741
It won't take long.

1771
01:25:07,825 --> 01:25:08,951
I'll join you
at the restaurant.

1772
01:25:09,034 --> 01:25:10,995
I'll give you
exactly 20 minutes.

1773
01:25:11,078 --> 01:25:12,538
I'll be there just
as soon as I can.

1774
01:25:12,579 --> 01:25:13,580
I promise.

1775
01:25:13,664 --> 01:25:15,290
All right, honey,
but don't be long, huh?

1776
01:25:15,374 --> 01:25:16,291
I won't.

1777
01:25:21,255 --> 01:25:22,214
Night, Kelly.

1778
01:25:22,256 --> 01:25:23,465
Good night.

1779
01:25:23,549 --> 01:25:24,800
I still can't see

1780
01:25:24,883 --> 01:25:26,176
anything wrong
with it.

1781
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,594
Lew, it's my first entrance.

1782
01:25:27,636 --> 01:25:29,013
I have to make
an impression,

1783
01:25:29,096 --> 01:25:30,514
and this dress
won't do it.

1784
01:25:30,597 --> 01:25:32,433
This shade of purple
is wrong for me.

1785
01:25:32,516 --> 01:25:34,560
The color is heliotrope.

1786
01:25:34,601 --> 01:25:36,729
Heliotrope, hydrangea,
petunia,

1787
01:25:36,812 --> 01:25:37,896
whatever you call it,

1788
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:39,732
it's still the wrong shade
of purple for me.

1789
01:25:39,773 --> 01:25:41,233
Hey, kids,
simmer down.

1790
01:25:41,275 --> 01:25:42,359
For two solid hours,

1791
01:25:42,443 --> 01:25:43,652
I haven't been
a producer.

1792
01:25:43,736 --> 01:25:45,154
I've been a referee.

1793
01:25:45,237 --> 01:25:46,905
Lew, it's as simple
as this:

1794
01:25:46,989 --> 01:25:48,782
Do you want me
to look right in this show?

1795
01:25:48,824 --> 01:25:50,367
Everyone else thinks
it looks wonderful.

1796
01:25:50,451 --> 01:25:52,286
She doesn't like it
because it's classic.

1797
01:25:52,328 --> 01:25:53,787
In color, in line,

1798
01:25:53,829 --> 01:25:55,289
in everything,
it's different.

1799
01:25:55,331 --> 01:25:56,790
It's different, all right.

1800
01:25:56,832 --> 01:25:58,584
Different from anything
I'm going to wear.

1801
01:25:58,625 --> 01:25:59,710
Let's be practical.

1802
01:25:59,793 --> 01:26:01,211
The dress cost $1,400,

1803
01:26:01,295 --> 01:26:02,713
and that's not heliotrope.

1804
01:26:04,965 --> 01:26:06,634
Yes?

1805
01:26:06,717 --> 01:26:08,427
Oh. Just a minute.

1806
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:10,429
Did you have a date
with young Donahue?

1807
01:26:10,471 --> 01:26:12,306
Poor Tim.
What time is it?

1808
01:26:12,348 --> 01:26:13,307
Oh, no.

1809
01:26:15,726 --> 01:26:16,935
Hello, Tim.

1810
01:26:17,019 --> 01:26:18,604
I'm terribly sorry.

1811
01:26:18,646 --> 01:26:20,648
It's taking longer
than I thought.

1812
01:26:20,731 --> 01:26:23,317
Yes, I know, but...

1813
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,819
Look, why don't you
start your dinner?

1814
01:26:25,903 --> 01:26:27,029
I won't be long.

1815
01:26:27,112 --> 01:26:28,864
I will. Bye.

1816
01:26:30,824 --> 01:26:32,284
- Now...
- Oh, now...

1817
01:26:32,326 --> 01:26:34,036
4th round,
coming up.

1818
01:26:34,119 --> 01:26:36,038
Oh, this whole argument's
ridiculous.

1819
01:27:14,368 --> 01:27:16,996
Are we alive,
or are we dead?

1820
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:22,167
Just as I thought. Dead.

1821
01:27:22,209 --> 01:27:25,421
Well, as long
as we're not on the air,

1822
01:27:25,504 --> 01:27:26,922
I can speak freely.

1823
01:27:27,006 --> 01:27:28,424
The time is now...

1824
01:27:32,094 --> 01:27:33,721
12:31 A.M.

1825
01:27:33,804 --> 01:27:35,431
It's tomorrow morning.

1826
01:27:35,514 --> 01:27:36,890
First the news.

1827
01:27:38,726 --> 01:27:42,146
The news is all bad,
so we'll skip it.

1828
01:27:42,229 --> 01:27:43,647
Instead, we'll bring you

1829
01:27:43,731 --> 01:27:46,150
the musical portion
of our program.

1830
01:27:54,033 --> 01:27:56,118
I would like
to dedicate this number

1831
01:27:56,201 --> 01:27:59,496
to a little girl who's
about to become a big star

1832
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:02,583
because she knows
exactly where she's going

1833
01:28:02,666 --> 01:28:05,127
and who she's
going there with.

1834
01:28:06,545 --> 01:28:09,381
<i>With whom
she's going there...</i>

1835
01:28:09,423 --> 01:28:10,382
with?

1836
01:28:11,759 --> 01:28:14,678
Anyway, I dedicate
this next number to her

1837
01:28:14,762 --> 01:28:16,513
and to me, too, because...

1838
01:28:16,597 --> 01:28:17,973
I ain't goin' there
with her.

1839
01:28:18,057 --> 01:28:21,018
Well, hello,
Miss Vicky Parker.

1840
01:28:21,101 --> 01:28:22,436
I'm terribly sorry, Tim.

1841
01:28:22,519 --> 01:28:23,604
Speak up.

1842
01:28:23,687 --> 01:28:25,147
I had no idea Geoffrey
was going to be there

1843
01:28:25,230 --> 01:28:26,815
and that we would get
into such a big hassle.

1844
01:28:26,899 --> 01:28:28,817
Oh, Geoffrey
was there, too?

1845
01:28:28,901 --> 01:28:30,527
Well, well...
Geoffrey!

1846
01:28:30,611 --> 01:28:33,238
Geoffrey. Geoffrey.
Here, Geoffrey.

1847
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,824
I don't see him.
Do you see him?

1848
01:28:35,908 --> 01:28:37,993
However, just because
I can't see him

1849
01:28:38,077 --> 01:28:39,828
doesn't mean
he wasn't there.

1850
01:28:39,912 --> 01:28:41,830
Of course, I can't
see anything. No.

1851
01:28:41,914 --> 01:28:43,666
Things can be right
in front of my nose,

1852
01:28:43,749 --> 01:28:44,917
and I can't see them.

1853
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,001
What things?

1854
01:28:47,127 --> 01:28:49,046
You want me
to spell it out for you?

1855
01:28:49,129 --> 01:28:50,047
No.

1856
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:53,801
Maybe it's crazy to try and
explain anything to you

1857
01:28:53,884 --> 01:28:55,803
the way you are now,

1858
01:28:55,886 --> 01:28:57,554
but, Tim,
try to understand,

1859
01:28:57,638 --> 01:29:00,474
to you, this is
just another show.

1860
01:29:00,516 --> 01:29:01,976
You're part
of this business.

1861
01:29:02,017 --> 01:29:03,560
You were born to it.

1862
01:29:03,644 --> 01:29:06,063
You never had
to pound on doors

1863
01:29:06,146 --> 01:29:08,482
to get people
to listen to you.

1864
01:29:08,524 --> 01:29:10,484
Your family did it all.

1865
01:29:10,526 --> 01:29:11,986
It's different with me.

1866
01:29:12,027 --> 01:29:14,279
I've been on my own
since I was 15.

1867
01:29:14,321 --> 01:29:17,491
This show is
my big chance.

1868
01:29:17,574 --> 01:29:19,034
It's make or break.

1869
01:29:19,118 --> 01:29:21,996
Don't worry, honey.
You'll make it.

1870
01:29:22,037 --> 01:29:23,747
You've got what it takes,

1871
01:29:23,831 --> 01:29:26,750
and you know
how to use it.

1872
01:29:26,834 --> 01:29:29,712
I don't have to take
that from you, Tim.

1873
01:29:29,795 --> 01:29:31,296
Why should I?

1874
01:29:31,338 --> 01:29:34,049
I don't owe you a thing.

1875
01:29:34,133 --> 01:29:36,051
That's right.
You don't.

1876
01:29:36,135 --> 01:29:37,636
You only owe Lew Harris.

1877
01:29:37,678 --> 01:29:39,138
You owe him everything.

1878
01:29:39,179 --> 01:29:41,140
And let it not be said

1879
01:29:41,181 --> 01:29:43,642
that you're a girl
who welches on her debts.

1880
01:29:43,684 --> 01:29:44,643
Get out.

1881
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:47,438
Get out of here!

1882
01:30:08,334 --> 01:30:10,044
Did you send
the flowers?

1883
01:30:10,085 --> 01:30:13,422
Molly, for the 40th time,
yes, I sent the flowers.

1884
01:30:13,505 --> 01:30:15,591
The florist said they'd
be at the theater by 7:30.

1885
01:30:15,674 --> 01:30:16,800
And what about
the reservation

1886
01:30:16,884 --> 01:30:17,968
at 21 for after the show?

1887
01:30:18,052 --> 01:30:19,011
Yes, I made it, Molly.

1888
01:30:19,094 --> 01:30:20,054
Now, will you calm down?

1889
01:30:20,137 --> 01:30:21,263
You'd think it was
our opening night.

1890
01:30:21,347 --> 01:30:23,474
I wish it was.
Those poor kids.

1891
01:30:23,557 --> 01:30:25,434
Oh, just another show.
They'll be great.

1892
01:30:27,811 --> 01:30:29,271
Hello.

1893
01:30:29,355 --> 01:30:30,814
Hello?

1894
01:30:30,898 --> 01:30:32,900
Katy?

1895
01:30:32,983 --> 01:30:34,443
What's the matter,
honey?

1896
01:30:34,485 --> 01:30:36,528
You sound
like you're crying.

1897
01:30:36,612 --> 01:30:39,907
What? No. Where?

1898
01:30:39,948 --> 01:30:41,950
Well, is he hurt bad?

1899
01:30:42,034 --> 01:30:43,661
Who? Who's hurt?

1900
01:30:43,744 --> 01:30:46,038
Was there anybody
with him?

1901
01:30:46,121 --> 01:30:47,081
Oh, I see.

1902
01:30:47,122 --> 01:30:48,082
Is it Tim?

1903
01:30:48,123 --> 01:30:49,083
Yes, but he's
not hurt bad.

1904
01:30:49,124 --> 01:30:50,250
He's just banged up
a little.

1905
01:30:50,334 --> 01:30:53,045
Look, Katy, I'm gonna
go right out there.

1906
01:30:53,128 --> 01:30:55,047
What hospital
did you say?

1907
01:30:55,130 --> 01:30:56,548
Yeah, I got that.
Uh-huh.

1908
01:30:56,632 --> 01:30:57,591
Now, look, honey...

1909
01:30:57,675 --> 01:30:58,842
Now, you stop crying

1910
01:30:58,926 --> 01:31:00,094
and get hold
of yourself,

1911
01:31:00,177 --> 01:31:01,261
and I'll send Mother

1912
01:31:01,345 --> 01:31:02,805
down to the theater
right away.

1913
01:31:02,846 --> 01:31:04,974
Yes, I'm leaving
this minute. Right.

1914
01:31:05,057 --> 01:31:05,975
All right, honey.
Good-bye.

1915
01:31:06,058 --> 01:31:07,476
What is it?
What happened?

1916
01:31:07,518 --> 01:31:08,644
He was with one
of the chorus girls,

1917
01:31:08,727 --> 01:31:10,104
and the car
turned over.

1918
01:31:10,145 --> 01:31:11,480
Katy said
he'd been drinking

1919
01:31:11,522 --> 01:31:12,731
up in White Plains
somewhere.

1920
01:31:12,815 --> 01:31:14,483
Are you sure
he's not badly hurt?

1921
01:31:14,566 --> 01:31:15,818
Katy said no.

1922
01:31:15,901 --> 01:31:17,736
What about the show tonight?
Why would Tim...

1923
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:20,864
Now, look, you get a cab
right away, will ya?

1924
01:31:20,948 --> 01:31:22,992
Go to the theater.
Katy needs you.

1925
01:31:23,075 --> 01:31:25,619
Will you call me
the minute you see him?

1926
01:31:25,703 --> 01:31:26,996
Yes, I will,
and don't worry.

1927
01:31:32,042 --> 01:31:34,253
Taxi. Taxi.

1928
01:31:34,336 --> 01:31:36,463
We'll just have to
cut it, that's all.

1929
01:31:36,547 --> 01:31:38,090
But you can't cut
that number, Lew.

1930
01:31:38,173 --> 01:31:39,633
That's Katy's best spot
in the show.

1931
01:31:39,717 --> 01:31:41,802
But, Mom, the understudy
can't do it like Tim.

1932
01:31:41,885 --> 01:31:42,845
Wouldn't mean a thing.

1933
01:31:42,886 --> 01:31:43,846
He can get away

1934
01:31:43,887 --> 01:31:44,847
with some
of the routines,

1935
01:31:44,888 --> 01:31:45,848
but not that number.

1936
01:31:45,889 --> 01:31:46,849
I don't know.

1937
01:31:46,890 --> 01:31:48,350
Maybe
the best thing to do

1938
01:31:48,392 --> 01:31:49,518
would be
to postpone.

1939
01:31:49,601 --> 01:31:51,395
Lew, why don't I
do it with her?

1940
01:31:51,478 --> 01:31:52,563
You?

1941
01:31:52,646 --> 01:31:54,189
Sure. I've been rehearsing
with her every night.

1942
01:31:54,273 --> 01:31:55,190
I know it backwards.

1943
01:31:55,274 --> 01:31:56,317
Oh, Molly, that's crazy.

1944
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:57,818
I'm telling you,
it'll work.

1945
01:31:57,860 --> 01:31:58,986
I'll have to fake
the dancing,

1946
01:31:59,028 --> 01:32:00,654
but I've been getting away
with that for years.

1947
01:32:00,696 --> 01:32:02,448
You think you can
go out there cold

1948
01:32:02,531 --> 01:32:03,741
and sell that number
with Katy?

1949
01:32:03,824 --> 01:32:06,243
No, I'm just talking.
Of course I could.

1950
01:32:06,327 --> 01:32:08,120
Why not, Lew? Why not?

1951
01:32:08,203 --> 01:32:09,747
OK, Molly.
You're on.

1952
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:10,748
You're hired.

1953
01:32:10,831 --> 01:32:12,708
Get the wardrobe
mistress up here.

1954
01:32:12,750 --> 01:32:13,834
Charlie, take them
to the green room.

1955
01:32:13,917 --> 01:32:15,002
I'll send
the orchestra leader

1956
01:32:15,044 --> 01:32:16,003
right down.

1957
01:32:16,045 --> 01:32:17,546
Me and my big mouth.

1958
01:32:17,588 --> 01:32:18,547
All right, everybody,

1959
01:32:18,589 --> 01:32:19,757
what are you standing
around here for?

1960
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,884
Let's go. We've got
a show to do.

1961
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,160
<i>I'm an old salt</i>

1962
01:32:48,202 --> 01:32:49,995
<i>I'm a young salt</i>

1963
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:51,080
<i>In the navy</i>

1964
01:32:51,163 --> 01:32:53,749
<i>We've been working
very hard</i>

1965
01:32:53,832 --> 01:32:56,669
<i>I was part
of that flotilla</i>

1966
01:32:56,710 --> 01:32:59,380
<i>With Dewey in Manila</i>

1967
01:32:59,463 --> 01:33:00,756
<i>I'm a new recruit</i>

1968
01:33:00,839 --> 01:33:02,549
<i>At the Brooklyn
Navy Yard</i>

1969
01:33:05,219 --> 01:33:10,683
<i>Tonight we're on a spree
and feeling flowery</i>

1970
01:33:10,724 --> 01:33:14,561
<i>We've got a date with gals
and drinks and food</i>

1971
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,399
<i>Across
the Brooklyn Bridge</i>

1972
01:33:18,440 --> 01:33:21,026
<i>Into the bowery</i>

1973
01:33:21,110 --> 01:33:24,571
<i>And I'm gonna get
the kid tattooed</i>

1974
01:33:26,115 --> 01:33:27,199
Tattooed?

1975
01:33:28,575 --> 01:33:29,702
Tattooed.

1976
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:33,956
<i>A sailor's
not a sailor</i>

1977
01:33:34,039 --> 01:33:37,209
<i>Till a sailor's been</i>

1978
01:33:37,251 --> 01:33:40,045
<i>Tattooed</i>

1979
01:33:43,674 --> 01:33:45,259
<i>Here's an anchor</i>

1980
01:33:45,342 --> 01:33:47,303
<i>From a tanker</i>

1981
01:33:47,386 --> 01:33:48,721
<i>That I sailed upon</i>

1982
01:33:48,762 --> 01:33:51,015
<i>When first
I went to sea</i>

1983
01:33:51,098 --> 01:33:52,850
<i>Here's another</i>

1984
01:33:52,933 --> 01:33:54,768
<i>Of my mother</i>

1985
01:33:54,852 --> 01:33:57,688
<i>Takes me back to when
I sat upon her knee</i>

1986
01:33:58,772 --> 01:34:01,525
<i>Here's a crimson heart</i>

1987
01:34:01,608 --> 01:34:03,944
<i>With a cupid's dart</i>

1988
01:34:03,986 --> 01:34:05,571
<i>Here's a battle cruiser</i>

1989
01:34:05,654 --> 01:34:08,073
<i>And when
I sit down</i>

1990
01:34:08,157 --> 01:34:09,992
<i>On that, too</i>

1991
01:34:10,075 --> 01:34:11,702
<i>There's a tattoo</i>

1992
01:34:11,785 --> 01:34:15,372
<i>Of my hometown</i>

1993
01:34:15,456 --> 01:34:19,001
<i>To the bowery</i>

1994
01:34:19,084 --> 01:34:20,252
<i>Cross the Brooklyn Bridge</i>

1995
01:34:20,294 --> 01:34:22,546
<i>And I'm just
in the mood</i>

1996
01:34:22,629 --> 01:34:24,715
<i>He'll be filled
with different mixtures</i>

1997
01:34:24,798 --> 01:34:26,216
<i>And covered up
with pictures</i>

1998
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:27,343
<i>I can't wait to be</i>

1999
01:34:27,426 --> 01:34:29,678
<i>It'll be great
to be tattooed</i>

2000
01:34:29,762 --> 01:34:33,223
<i>Tattooed</i>

2001
01:34:33,307 --> 01:34:36,727
<i>A sailor's not a sailor</i>

2002
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:40,439
<i>Till a sailor's been</i>

2003
01:34:40,481 --> 01:34:45,361
<i>Ta-a-a-ttooed</i>

2004
01:34:56,330 --> 01:35:00,584
<i>Tattooed</i>

2005
01:35:00,668 --> 01:35:03,671
<i>A sailor's not a sailor</i>

2006
01:35:04,838 --> 01:35:09,718
<i>Till a sailor's
been tattooed</i>

2007
01:35:25,776 --> 01:35:28,529
<i>Oh, a sailor's
not a sailor</i>

2008
01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:32,992
<i>Till a sailor's
been tattooed</i>

2009
01:35:33,033 --> 01:35:35,244
<i>Tattoo, tattoo</i>

2010
01:35:35,327 --> 01:35:37,204
<i>A sailor's not a sailor</i>

2011
01:35:37,246 --> 01:35:39,581
<i>Till he's been tattooed</i>

2012
01:36:28,213 --> 01:36:32,551
<i>Tattooed</i>

2013
01:36:32,593 --> 01:36:34,595
<i>A sailor's not a sailor</i>

2014
01:36:34,678 --> 01:36:36,722
<i>Till a sailor's been</i>

2015
01:36:36,764 --> 01:36:41,518
<i>Tattooed</i>

2016
01:37:10,422 --> 01:37:11,632
Hiya, Pop.

2017
01:37:14,134 --> 01:37:15,344
How's the girl?

2018
01:37:15,427 --> 01:37:16,845
She's all right,
I guess. Uh...

2019
01:37:16,929 --> 01:37:18,514
they had to take
a couple of stitches,

2020
01:37:18,597 --> 01:37:20,182
but the doctor said
none of them would show.

2021
01:37:20,265 --> 01:37:21,183
How 'bout you?

2022
01:37:21,266 --> 01:37:22,601
I'm all right.
They, uh...

2023
01:37:22,643 --> 01:37:24,103
took a couple
of X-rays,

2024
01:37:24,144 --> 01:37:25,562
just want me
to stay overnight

2025
01:37:25,646 --> 01:37:26,689
for observation.

2026
01:37:26,772 --> 01:37:29,024
All right, let's have it.
What happened?

2027
01:37:29,108 --> 01:37:30,609
Didn't they
tell you downstairs?

2028
01:37:30,651 --> 01:37:33,570
Yeah, they told me downstairs.
I'd like to hear it from you.

2029
01:37:33,654 --> 01:37:36,323
OK, I was drunk.
I was loaded.

2030
01:37:36,407 --> 01:37:38,367
The girl didn't like
the way I was driving,

2031
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:40,828
so she took the wheel,
and I passed out.

2032
01:37:40,911 --> 01:37:42,705
Next thing I knew,
we were in a ditch,

2033
01:37:42,788 --> 01:37:45,165
the car rolled over
a couple of times,

2034
01:37:45,249 --> 01:37:47,918
and, uh... well, that's
about the whole story.

2035
01:37:48,002 --> 01:37:49,169
Well, if you think
that's the whole story,

2036
01:37:49,253 --> 01:37:51,338
you got even
less sense than...

2037
01:37:51,422 --> 01:37:53,173
You know, I thought
you were just a kid

2038
01:37:53,215 --> 01:37:54,883
who got out of line
a few times.

2039
01:37:54,967 --> 01:37:57,594
But you're not a kid anymore.
You know the score.

2040
01:37:57,678 --> 01:37:59,430
Have you any idea
what you pulled tonight?

2041
01:37:59,513 --> 01:38:00,973
What do you mean,
it's opening night,

2042
01:38:01,015 --> 01:38:02,474
the show must go on,
that routine?

2043
01:38:02,516 --> 01:38:04,601
No, no. They'll get
the show on without you.

2044
01:38:04,685 --> 01:38:06,520
You're not that important.

2045
01:38:06,562 --> 01:38:08,814
You didn't hurt anybody
tonight but yourself.

2046
01:38:08,856 --> 01:38:11,150
All right. So I had
the chance of a lifetime,

2047
01:38:11,191 --> 01:38:13,319
and I blew it, so what?

2048
01:38:13,402 --> 01:38:15,279
What's got into you?

2049
01:38:15,362 --> 01:38:17,031
Who do you think you are?

2050
01:38:17,072 --> 01:38:18,449
I'll tell you what you are.

2051
01:38:18,532 --> 01:38:20,576
You're nothing, because
you've made yourself nothing,

2052
01:38:20,659 --> 01:38:22,077
you conceited little punk.

2053
01:38:22,161 --> 01:38:24,079
I wouldn't care if I
never saw you again.

2054
01:38:24,163 --> 01:38:25,372
Oh, come on now, Pop.

2055
01:38:25,456 --> 01:38:27,708
I heard there's a big
crop of corn this year,

2056
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:28,792
- but...
- What?

2057
01:38:28,876 --> 01:38:30,586
Corn. H-A-M. Corn.

2058
01:38:41,889 --> 01:38:43,349
Did you put in
a clean shirt?

2059
01:38:43,390 --> 01:38:44,516
Yeah. I got
everything he needs.

2060
01:38:44,558 --> 01:38:45,851
Now, remember, when we
get to the hospital,

2061
01:38:45,893 --> 01:38:47,811
you promised me not
to be tough with him.

2062
01:38:47,895 --> 01:38:49,355
He's just no good,
Mother.

2063
01:38:49,396 --> 01:38:50,606
You should've
heard him last night.

2064
01:38:50,689 --> 01:38:52,107
But it's not all his fault.

2065
01:38:52,191 --> 01:38:53,942
I found out a lot
of things last night.

2066
01:38:54,026 --> 01:38:56,695
That Parker girl's been
giving him a rough time.

2067
01:38:56,737 --> 01:38:58,822
I knew she was
no good for him.

2068
01:38:58,906 --> 01:39:01,825
You can blame the girl,
but everybody else blames him.

2069
01:39:06,163 --> 01:39:07,498
Are you gonna tell him

2070
01:39:07,581 --> 01:39:09,458
that they want you
to stay in the show?

2071
01:39:09,541 --> 01:39:11,502
Sure. It'll only
be a few days.

2072
01:39:11,585 --> 01:39:12,544
It's down here.

2073
01:39:12,628 --> 01:39:14,004
Oh.

2074
01:39:14,088 --> 01:39:15,214
Can I help you?

2075
01:39:15,255 --> 01:39:16,965
I'm Mr. Donahue.
My son is in 4...

2076
01:39:17,049 --> 01:39:17,966
Oh! I...

2077
01:39:18,050 --> 01:39:19,134
Is there
something wrong?

2078
01:39:19,218 --> 01:39:20,719
Your son isn't here.

2079
01:39:20,761 --> 01:39:22,846
He seems to have picked
himself up last night

2080
01:39:22,930 --> 01:39:23,889
and walked out.

2081
01:39:23,931 --> 01:39:26,475
He left this note
for you.

2082
01:39:26,558 --> 01:39:27,601
Thank you.

2083
01:39:35,776 --> 01:39:36,819
"Dear folks,

2084
01:39:36,902 --> 01:39:39,822
"I'm sorry I gave you
such a bad time.

2085
01:39:39,905 --> 01:39:41,991
"I think Pop was right.

2086
01:39:42,074 --> 01:39:44,576
"You'll all be
better off without me.

2087
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:47,079
"See you around
sometime.

2088
01:39:47,121 --> 01:39:48,497
"Don't worry.

2089
01:39:48,580 --> 01:39:50,082
Love, Tim."

2090
01:40:11,061 --> 01:40:12,980
Molly:
"Don't worry." Ha.

2091
01:40:13,022 --> 01:40:14,273
That's a laugh.

2092
01:40:14,315 --> 01:40:16,275
You start worrying
about your kids

2093
01:40:16,317 --> 01:40:19,361
the day they're born,
and you never stop.

2094
01:40:19,445 --> 01:40:22,406
Even after they bury you,
I bet you never stop.

2095
01:40:24,158 --> 01:40:26,118
Of course
we did everything

2096
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:28,412
we possibly could
to find him.

2097
01:40:28,495 --> 01:40:30,956
Went to the police.

2098
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:34,418
Checked booking offices,
in case he tried to work.

2099
01:40:34,501 --> 01:40:36,837
Even hired detectives
of our own.

2100
01:40:38,172 --> 01:40:39,465
Once, later on,

2101
01:40:39,506 --> 01:40:41,842
we heard he was working
under a different name

2102
01:40:41,925 --> 01:40:44,428
with a trio down
in Greenwich Village.

2103
01:40:52,269 --> 01:40:53,604
<i>Oh, Marie</i>

2104
01:40:53,646 --> 01:40:55,147
<i>Time for sleepin'
is done</i>

2105
01:40:55,230 --> 01:40:56,482
<i>The dawn is breaking</i>

2106
01:40:56,565 --> 01:40:58,359
<i>Take a peek
at that sun</i>

2107
01:40:58,442 --> 01:40:59,860
<i>Sweet Marie</i>

2108
01:40:59,943 --> 01:41:01,236
<i>Better open
your eyes</i>

2109
01:41:01,278 --> 01:41:02,446
<i>You'll soon be awake</i>

2110
01:41:02,529 --> 01:41:04,573
<i>Now's the time
to arise</i>

2111
01:41:04,615 --> 01:41:05,824
<i>Oh, Marie</i>

2112
01:41:05,908 --> 01:41:07,660
<i>Both:
My broken heart</i>

2113
01:41:07,743 --> 01:41:08,661
<i>My heart is</i>

2114
01:41:08,744 --> 01:41:12,665
<i>All:
Aching for you</i>

2115
01:41:12,748 --> 01:41:14,124
<i>For you</i>

2116
01:41:14,208 --> 01:41:19,755
<i>My sweet
Ma-Ma-Marie</i>

2117
01:41:24,969 --> 01:41:26,929
Every place
you went those days,

2118
01:41:26,971 --> 01:41:29,640
you saw more
and more uniforms.

2119
01:41:29,723 --> 01:41:31,976
Half the world
was fighting already,

2120
01:41:32,059 --> 01:41:34,812
and the other half was
rehearsing to get into it.

2121
01:41:34,853 --> 01:41:38,524
Even Steve had applied
to go over as a chaplain.

2122
01:41:56,542 --> 01:41:58,460
Better wait under here,
Miss Parker.

2123
01:41:58,502 --> 01:41:59,962
I'll only be a minute.

2124
01:42:00,004 --> 01:42:01,463
Thanks, Kelly.

2125
01:42:08,512 --> 01:42:10,514
Oh, uh... Kelly's
getting me a cab.

2126
01:42:10,556 --> 01:42:11,974
May I drop you
someplace?

2127
01:42:12,016 --> 01:42:13,142
No, thank you.

2128
01:42:13,183 --> 01:42:15,144
I just thought it would
give us a chance to...

2129
01:42:15,185 --> 01:42:17,187
Oh, that's quite all right.
There are plenty of cabs.

2130
01:42:17,229 --> 01:42:18,439
I'll find one.

2131
01:42:28,198 --> 01:42:29,283
All ready?

2132
01:42:29,366 --> 01:42:31,660
I changed my mind,
Molly. I'm not going.

2133
01:42:31,702 --> 01:42:32,995
Aw, come on, Terry.

2134
01:42:33,037 --> 01:42:34,663
You can drop me off
at the theater

2135
01:42:34,705 --> 01:42:36,332
and then go over
The Lamb's Club

2136
01:42:36,415 --> 01:42:37,624
and have a few laughs.

2137
01:42:37,708 --> 01:42:39,668
And then I'll pick you up
after the show.

2138
01:42:39,752 --> 01:42:41,754
We can take in
a midnight movie, hmm?

2139
01:42:41,837 --> 01:42:44,173
Thanks, Molly.
I'm just not up to it.

2140
01:42:44,214 --> 01:42:45,215
OK.

2141
01:42:46,717 --> 01:42:48,093
See you later.

2142
01:42:51,555 --> 01:42:52,640
Oh, uh, Terry,

2143
01:42:52,723 --> 01:42:54,099
I came across
some old arrangements,

2144
01:42:54,183 --> 01:42:55,768
the stuff we used to do
with the kids.

2145
01:42:55,851 --> 01:42:57,227
Let's go over them
tomorrow, huh?

2146
01:42:57,311 --> 01:42:58,312
What for?

2147
01:42:58,395 --> 01:43:00,064
Well, the actor's fund's
having a benefit

2148
01:43:00,147 --> 01:43:01,899
on the 19th.
I told you about it.

2149
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:03,025
They're tearing down
the Hippodrome,

2150
01:43:03,108 --> 01:43:04,526
and they're trying
to get together

2151
01:43:04,568 --> 01:43:05,986
some of the old acts
that played there.

2152
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:07,154
I'm a pretty old act.

2153
01:43:07,237 --> 01:43:08,614
Maybe they better
tear me down, too.

2154
01:43:08,697 --> 01:43:10,074
But they want us
to be in the show.

2155
01:43:10,157 --> 01:43:11,075
You're kiddin', Molly.

2156
01:43:11,158 --> 01:43:12,910
You know I couldn't
go out on a stage.

2157
01:43:12,993 --> 01:43:14,203
I haven't done
an act since...

2158
01:43:14,244 --> 01:43:15,704
Oh, Terry will you stop
talking this way?

2159
01:43:15,746 --> 01:43:16,914
It's not gonna help anything.

2160
01:43:16,997 --> 01:43:18,707
What are you gonna do,
spend the rest of your life

2161
01:43:18,749 --> 01:43:20,668
moping around like this,
blaming yourself?

2162
01:43:20,751 --> 01:43:23,003
Look, I miss him, too.
Every day. Every minute.

2163
01:43:23,087 --> 01:43:24,505
But at least I keep goin'.

2164
01:43:24,588 --> 01:43:26,465
How do you think I feel
goin' on every night,

2165
01:43:26,548 --> 01:43:27,549
working with that girl?

2166
01:43:27,591 --> 01:43:28,592
Oh, Molly.

2167
01:43:28,634 --> 01:43:30,594
Come on, you're going
into town with me.

2168
01:43:30,636 --> 01:43:32,096
Why? So we can
walk down Broadway,

2169
01:43:32,179 --> 01:43:33,639
and you can look
into the face

2170
01:43:33,722 --> 01:43:35,182
of every young kid
that goes by?

2171
01:43:35,265 --> 01:43:36,183
Terry, please.

2172
01:43:36,266 --> 01:43:37,267
Oh, Molly,
for Pete's sake,

2173
01:43:37,351 --> 01:43:38,435
will you stop
nagging me?

2174
01:43:38,519 --> 01:43:39,937
I said I'm not going,
and I'm not.

2175
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:41,438
And that benefit
on the 19th,

2176
01:43:41,480 --> 01:43:42,898
just figure
to play it yourself

2177
01:43:42,940 --> 01:43:44,066
because I won't be here.

2178
01:43:44,108 --> 01:43:45,109
Why? Where you going?

2179
01:43:45,192 --> 01:43:46,276
I'm gonna go find him.

2180
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:47,820
Where? How do you know
where to look?

2181
01:43:47,903 --> 01:43:49,321
I don't. But I can't
sit around here

2182
01:43:49,405 --> 01:43:50,322
any longer, Molly.

2183
01:43:50,406 --> 01:43:51,824
I got to do
something. I...

2184
01:43:51,907 --> 01:43:53,867
Terry, I'll be late
if I don't go now.

2185
01:43:53,951 --> 01:43:55,411
Promise me you won't
do anything crazy.

2186
01:43:55,452 --> 01:43:57,371
We can talk about it
when I get home.

2187
01:43:57,454 --> 01:43:59,623
I'll be early. I'll skip
the curtain call, OK?

2188
01:43:59,707 --> 01:44:00,708
Sure, Molly.

2189
01:44:54,178 --> 01:44:56,680
<i>I'll grab him
by the collar</i>

2190
01:44:56,764 --> 01:44:57,973
<i>And I'll holler</i>

2191
01:44:58,015 --> 01:45:00,017
<i>- Ala
- Bam'</i>

2192
01:45:30,589 --> 01:45:31,548
Hi.

2193
01:45:31,590 --> 01:45:32,841
Well, hello,
Molly darling.

2194
01:45:32,925 --> 01:45:33,884
Bobby!

2195
01:45:33,926 --> 01:45:35,219
Hello, Molly! Heh heh!

2196
01:45:35,260 --> 01:45:36,512
- Oh, Mrs. Donahue.
- Yes?

2197
01:45:36,595 --> 01:45:38,263
You and your daughter
are in, uh, 12-A.

2198
01:45:38,347 --> 01:45:39,723
Up these stairs
to your left.

2199
01:45:39,807 --> 01:45:40,724
Thanks.

2200
01:45:40,808 --> 01:45:43,143
I'll hang your dress up
back here.

2201
01:45:43,227 --> 01:45:44,395
Thanks, Katy.

2202
01:45:44,478 --> 01:45:45,688
Now, look,
when she gets here,

2203
01:45:45,729 --> 01:45:46,939
let me get things started.

2204
01:45:47,022 --> 01:45:48,190
I know how to handle her.

2205
01:45:48,273 --> 01:45:50,442
OK. But you know
how many times

2206
01:45:50,526 --> 01:45:51,860
I've tried
at the theater.

2207
01:45:51,902 --> 01:45:53,904
She just won't
listen to me.

2208
01:45:55,572 --> 01:45:57,324
Oh, hi, Mom.
Come on in.

2209
01:45:57,408 --> 01:45:59,076
Here, I'll take that.

2210
01:45:59,159 --> 01:46:00,494
It's a little crowded
in here, isn't it?

2211
01:46:00,577 --> 01:46:01,912
No. You'll have
loads of room.

2212
01:46:01,954 --> 01:46:02,913
I've moved upstairs.

2213
01:46:02,955 --> 01:46:04,123
You and Vicky
are sharing.

2214
01:46:04,206 --> 01:46:05,207
Oh, are we?

2215
01:46:05,249 --> 01:46:06,709
Well, if it's all
the same to you,

2216
01:46:06,750 --> 01:46:08,210
I'll dress in the powder room
or someplace.

2217
01:46:08,252 --> 01:46:10,004
You'll do nothing
of the kind.

2218
01:46:10,087 --> 01:46:11,046
I told you
it wouldn't work.

2219
01:46:11,088 --> 01:46:12,423
It'll work.
It'll work.

2220
01:46:12,506 --> 01:46:13,799
Probably won't,
but I'm curious.

2221
01:46:13,882 --> 01:46:14,925
What is it?

2222
01:46:15,009 --> 01:46:16,969
Mom, I think you
owe Vicky an apology.

2223
01:46:17,052 --> 01:46:17,970
What?

2224
01:46:18,053 --> 01:46:19,680
This isn't my idea,
Mrs. Donahue.

2225
01:46:19,763 --> 01:46:21,056
No, it isn't.
It's mine.

2226
01:46:21,098 --> 01:46:22,224
I think it's high time

2227
01:46:22,266 --> 01:46:23,767
you two got things
straightened out.

2228
01:46:23,851 --> 01:46:25,311
Ooh, so that's the plot.

2229
01:46:25,394 --> 01:46:26,353
Apparently, my daughter...

2230
01:46:26,437 --> 01:46:27,563
<i>You are my daughter,</i>

2231
01:46:27,646 --> 01:46:28,772
aren't you, Mrs. Gibbs?

2232
01:46:28,856 --> 01:46:29,773
I think so.

2233
01:46:29,857 --> 01:46:31,275
Apparently,
my daughter has the idea

2234
01:46:31,317 --> 01:46:33,277
that you and I
ought to be friends.

2235
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:34,778
Do you mind if I ask her

2236
01:46:34,820 --> 01:46:36,280
what she thinks
we have in common?

2237
01:46:36,363 --> 01:46:38,574
It's very simple.
You both love Tim.

2238
01:46:38,615 --> 01:46:40,242
Oh, I see.

2239
01:46:40,284 --> 01:46:42,453
Aren't you a little late?

2240
01:46:42,536 --> 01:46:45,331
I might be.
I hope not.

2241
01:46:45,414 --> 01:46:48,334
Mom, I'm crazy
about you, but...

2242
01:46:48,417 --> 01:46:50,878
but you're stubborn,
and you're awfully tough.

2243
01:46:50,961 --> 01:46:52,921
You can't go on
blaming Vicky.

2244
01:46:52,963 --> 01:46:54,548
It was really Tim's fault.

2245
01:46:54,631 --> 01:46:55,966
He did this whole thing
to himself.

2246
01:46:56,050 --> 01:46:58,260
I was around. I saw it.

2247
01:46:58,302 --> 01:47:00,679
You've gotta hear
her side of it.

2248
01:47:00,763 --> 01:47:01,930
I'm getting out of here.

2249
01:47:02,014 --> 01:47:03,974
The doctor said
I shouldn't get excited,

2250
01:47:04,058 --> 01:47:06,101
and I'm all worked up.

2251
01:47:06,143 --> 01:47:08,437
Be a little easy,
will you, Mom?

2252
01:47:11,982 --> 01:47:14,526
Maybe I am tough and
stubborn, Miss Parker,

2253
01:47:14,610 --> 01:47:17,863
but from where I sit,
it's pretty hard to believe

2254
01:47:17,946 --> 01:47:20,282
that you're really
in love with Tim.

2255
01:47:20,324 --> 01:47:22,493
I don't know how
to convince you,

2256
01:47:22,576 --> 01:47:23,661
but it's true.

2257
01:47:23,744 --> 01:47:25,621
Then fit Lew Harris
into this pretty picture,

2258
01:47:25,663 --> 01:47:26,747
will you?

2259
01:47:26,830 --> 01:47:29,583
Lew did everything for me.
You know that.

2260
01:47:29,667 --> 01:47:31,418
Maybe he did
have some ideas.

2261
01:47:31,502 --> 01:47:33,754
It doesn't mean
that I shared them.

2262
01:47:33,837 --> 01:47:36,382
There was never anyone
for me but Tim.

2263
01:47:36,507 --> 01:47:38,133
Too bad you didn't
let him know.

2264
01:47:38,217 --> 01:47:39,969
I tried to,
Mrs. Donahue,

2265
01:47:40,052 --> 01:47:41,929
but he was
pretty stubborn, too.

2266
01:47:44,306 --> 01:47:45,307
Come in.

2267
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:49,812
Steve! Steve!

2268
01:47:49,895 --> 01:47:52,398
Mom!

2269
01:47:52,439 --> 01:47:54,441
Oh, it's so good
to see you!

2270
01:47:54,483 --> 01:47:56,860
You look wonderful,
Father Donahue!

2271
01:47:56,944 --> 01:47:59,154
Thin, but wonderful.

2272
01:47:59,238 --> 01:48:00,406
Oh, excuse me.

2273
01:48:00,489 --> 01:48:02,658
This is Tim's brother
Father Donahue.

2274
01:48:02,741 --> 01:48:04,243
Steve, Vicky Parker.

2275
01:48:04,326 --> 01:48:05,661
How do you do,
Miss Parker?

2276
01:48:05,744 --> 01:48:07,454
I'm glad
to know you, Father.

2277
01:48:07,538 --> 01:48:09,540
Tim used to talk
about you a lot.

2278
01:48:09,623 --> 01:48:11,125
He was very proud
of you.

2279
01:48:11,208 --> 01:48:13,836
Thank you. He talked
a lot about you, too.

2280
01:48:13,919 --> 01:48:15,004
That's nice.

2281
01:48:15,087 --> 01:48:16,422
Well, if you'll
excuse me,

2282
01:48:16,463 --> 01:48:18,674
I'll find out where
they have me spotted

2283
01:48:18,757 --> 01:48:20,718
in the show.

2284
01:48:20,801 --> 01:48:23,929
Oh, Vicky.
Will you do me a favor?

2285
01:48:23,971 --> 01:48:25,306
If you see Katy,

2286
01:48:25,389 --> 01:48:27,308
tell her that her mother
isn't stubborn.

2287
01:48:27,349 --> 01:48:29,435
It might take her
two or three years

2288
01:48:29,518 --> 01:48:31,270
to change her mind,

2289
01:48:31,353 --> 01:48:33,147
but she's not stubborn.

2290
01:48:35,024 --> 01:48:36,483
Thanks, Mrs. Donahue.

2291
01:48:36,567 --> 01:48:37,901
See you later.

2292
01:48:40,988 --> 01:48:42,323
So that's the girl?

2293
01:48:42,406 --> 01:48:44,908
Yeah. Nice girl, too.

2294
01:48:44,992 --> 01:48:46,827
Your mom was
wrong again. Ha.

2295
01:48:46,910 --> 01:48:49,163
Why didn't you let us
know you were coming?

2296
01:48:49,246 --> 01:48:50,664
Mom, I didn't know
myself.

2297
01:48:50,748 --> 01:48:51,749
The whole regiment

2298
01:48:51,832 --> 01:48:53,667
was just handed
a 24-hour pass.

2299
01:48:53,751 --> 01:48:55,169
Now, I knew
by the papers

2300
01:48:55,210 --> 01:48:56,670
that you're doing
a show here, so...

2301
01:48:56,712 --> 01:48:58,172
A 24-hour pass?
Does that mean that...

2302
01:48:58,213 --> 01:48:59,673
It means a 24-hour pass.

2303
01:48:59,715 --> 01:49:01,383
Don't you double-talk me,
Steve Donahue.

2304
01:49:01,467 --> 01:49:03,218
Mom, I'm not supposed
to say any more.

2305
01:49:03,302 --> 01:49:06,805
Besides, I don't know
any more.

2306
01:49:06,847 --> 01:49:08,390
Say, shouldn't you
be getting ready?

2307
01:49:08,474 --> 01:49:10,309
Oh, I'm all made up.

2308
01:49:10,351 --> 01:49:11,644
Just have
to put my dress on.

2309
01:49:11,727 --> 01:49:12,978
Only be a minute.

2310
01:49:15,731 --> 01:49:17,316
Is, uh...

2311
01:49:17,399 --> 01:49:18,776
Pop back?

2312
01:49:18,859 --> 01:49:20,361
No.

2313
01:49:20,444 --> 01:49:21,445
How did you know?

2314
01:49:21,528 --> 01:49:22,946
Katy wrote me.

2315
01:49:23,030 --> 01:49:24,948
I wish
there was some way

2316
01:49:25,032 --> 01:49:26,283
we could help him.

2317
01:49:26,367 --> 01:49:28,827
Yeah. Did, uh,
Katy also write you

2318
01:49:28,911 --> 01:49:30,871
that you're
gonna be an uncle?

2319
01:49:30,954 --> 01:49:33,290
Yeah. Isn't that great?

2320
01:49:33,374 --> 01:49:35,668
She booked me
for the christening.

2321
01:49:35,709 --> 01:49:39,296
At least she and Charlie
are happy.

2322
01:49:39,380 --> 01:49:41,674
Any news about Tim?

2323
01:49:41,757 --> 01:49:42,883
Not a word.

2324
01:49:46,303 --> 01:49:48,347
It's over a year, Steve.

2325
01:49:48,389 --> 01:49:51,600
Even the detectives
have given up.

2326
01:49:51,684 --> 01:49:55,354
I still believe
he'll be back, Mom.

2327
01:49:55,396 --> 01:49:57,523
I'm not so sure.

2328
01:49:57,606 --> 01:50:00,859
Sometimes I think we'll...
never see him again.

2329
01:50:00,901 --> 01:50:01,902
Mom...

2330
01:50:03,445 --> 01:50:05,531
don't lose faith.

2331
01:50:05,614 --> 01:50:07,992
I don't always
think that, Steve.

2332
01:50:08,075 --> 01:50:09,702
Just sometimes.

2333
01:50:10,911 --> 01:50:14,123
Man: You're on next,
Mrs. Donahue. Five minutes.

2334
01:50:14,206 --> 01:50:15,457
Be right with you.

2335
01:50:18,252 --> 01:50:20,254
You wanna watch
from the wings?

2336
01:50:20,337 --> 01:50:22,798
Yeah. That'll be great.

2337
01:50:22,881 --> 01:50:24,258
OK, I'll fix it.

2338
01:50:50,242 --> 01:50:53,954
<i>There's no business
like show business</i>

2339
01:50:54,038 --> 01:50:57,833
<i>Like no business I know</i>

2340
01:50:57,916 --> 01:51:01,378
<i>Everything about it
is appealing</i>

2341
01:51:01,462 --> 01:51:05,007
<i>Everything the traffic
will allow</i>

2342
01:51:05,090 --> 01:51:07,968
<i>Nowhere could you get
that happy feeling</i>

2343
01:51:08,052 --> 01:51:11,847
<i>When you are stealing
that extra bow</i>

2344
01:51:11,930 --> 01:51:15,643
<i>There's no people
like show people</i>

2345
01:51:15,726 --> 01:51:19,438
<i>They smile
when they are low</i>

2346
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:22,858
<i>Yesterday they told you
you would not go far</i>

2347
01:51:22,941 --> 01:51:24,652
<i>That night you open</i>

2348
01:51:24,735 --> 01:51:26,612
<i>And there you are</i>

2349
01:51:26,654 --> 01:51:28,447
<i>Next day,
on your dressing room</i>

2350
01:51:28,530 --> 01:51:30,240
<i>They've hung a star</i>

2351
01:51:30,324 --> 01:51:35,996
<i>Let's go
on with the show</i>

2352
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:37,998
<i>The costumes,
the scenery</i>

2353
01:51:38,082 --> 01:51:39,833
<i>The makeup, the props</i>

2354
01:51:39,917 --> 01:51:43,629
<i>The audience that lifts you
when you're down</i>

2355
01:51:43,671 --> 01:51:45,172
<i>The headaches,
the heartaches</i>

2356
01:51:45,255 --> 01:51:47,049
<i>The backaches, the flops</i>

2357
01:51:47,132 --> 01:51:51,303
<i>The sheriff who escorts you
out of town</i>

2358
01:51:51,387 --> 01:51:53,347
<i>The opening
when your heart beats</i>

2359
01:51:53,389 --> 01:51:57,101
<i>Like a drum</i>

2360
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:58,435
<i>The closing</i>

2361
01:51:58,519 --> 01:52:04,358
<i>When the customers
don't come</i>

2362
01:52:04,441 --> 01:52:06,360
<i>There's</i>

2363
01:52:06,402 --> 01:52:09,446
<i>No business
like show business</i>

2364
01:52:09,530 --> 01:52:13,075
<i>Like no business I know</i>

2365
01:52:13,158 --> 01:52:16,620
<i>You get word
before the show has started</i>

2366
01:52:16,704 --> 01:52:19,873
<i>That your favorite uncle
died at dawn</i>

2367
01:52:19,957 --> 01:52:23,002
<i>On top of that,
your pa and ma have parted</i>

2368
01:52:23,043 --> 01:52:24,837
<i>You're brokenhearted</i>

2369
01:52:24,920 --> 01:52:26,797
<i>But you go on</i>

2370
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:30,551
<i>There's no people
like show people</i>

2371
01:52:30,634 --> 01:52:33,178
<i>They smile
when they are low</i>

2372
01:52:33,262 --> 01:52:34,221
Mom.

2373
01:52:34,305 --> 01:52:35,723
<i>Even with a turkey</i>

2374
01:52:35,764 --> 01:52:37,850
<i>That you know will fold</i>

2375
01:52:37,933 --> 01:52:41,520
<i>You may be stranded
out in the cold</i>

2376
01:52:41,603 --> 01:52:42,938
<i>Still you wouldn't
change it</i>

2377
01:52:43,022 --> 01:52:44,732
<i>For a sack of gold</i>

2378
01:52:44,815 --> 01:52:48,027
<i>Let's go
on with the show</i>

2379
01:52:50,446 --> 01:52:52,531
<i>Let's go</i>

2380
01:52:52,614 --> 01:52:56,285
<i>On with the</i>

2381
01:52:56,368 --> 01:53:02,207
<i>Show</i>

2382
01:53:03,500 --> 01:53:04,710
Tim!

2383
01:53:04,752 --> 01:53:06,045
Darling!

2384
01:53:08,756 --> 01:53:11,383
Oh, why did you
do it, Tim, why?

2385
01:53:11,425 --> 01:53:12,968
Well, I had to, Mom.

2386
01:53:13,052 --> 01:53:15,262
I had to work things
out for myself.

2387
01:53:15,346 --> 01:53:16,263
Oh!

2388
01:53:18,349 --> 01:53:19,350
Where's Pop?

2389
01:53:19,433 --> 01:53:21,060
Oh, he's... he's...

2390
01:53:21,101 --> 01:53:23,020
Here, son.

2391
01:53:24,188 --> 01:53:25,439
Terry!

2392
01:53:38,744 --> 01:53:39,912
Hello, Pop.

2393
01:53:42,164 --> 01:53:43,248
Oh, Tim.

2394
01:53:44,958 --> 01:53:46,126
Oh, Terry!

2395
01:53:46,210 --> 01:53:47,544
Hi, Molly.

2396
01:53:49,838 --> 01:53:51,423
Will you look
at the woman?

2397
01:53:51,507 --> 01:53:53,550
You'd think I was the
one who'd been lost.

2398
01:53:53,634 --> 01:53:55,761
Please, Mrs. Donahue.
We're dead out there.

2399
01:53:55,803 --> 01:53:57,596
You're supposed to lead us
into the big number.

2400
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:58,889
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

2401
01:53:58,973 --> 01:54:00,349
I'll be right with you.

2402
01:54:00,432 --> 01:54:01,684
Somebody give me
their handkerchief.

2403
01:54:01,767 --> 01:54:02,935
Here. I got one.

2404
01:54:02,977 --> 01:54:04,770
All right, now,
you all hold it.

2405
01:54:04,812 --> 01:54:06,313
I'll take care of this.

2406
01:54:06,355 --> 01:54:07,356
Just stand back.

2407
01:54:12,277 --> 01:54:13,445
Ladies and gentlemen,

2408
01:54:13,529 --> 01:54:15,906
first I want to thank you
for being so patient.

2409
01:54:15,948 --> 01:54:18,200
My wife got
just a little excited.

2410
01:54:18,283 --> 01:54:19,702
You see, the last time

2411
01:54:19,785 --> 01:54:21,453
we played
this wonderful old theater

2412
01:54:21,537 --> 01:54:23,872
was the last time
that The Five Donahues

2413
01:54:23,956 --> 01:54:25,374
appeared together
as an act.

2414
01:54:25,457 --> 01:54:26,375
Well, after that,

2415
01:54:26,458 --> 01:54:27,918
lots of things happened, and...

2416
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:30,379
well, that's just the way
it was until...

2417
01:54:30,462 --> 01:54:32,423
just now, backstage
when The Five Donahues

2418
01:54:32,464 --> 01:54:33,549
got together again.

2419
01:54:33,632 --> 01:54:35,217
And because we're
kind of sentimental

2420
01:54:35,301 --> 01:54:36,510
about this old theater,

2421
01:54:36,593 --> 01:54:38,178
we'd like to do
a little bit of

2422
01:54:38,262 --> 01:54:39,513
<i>Alexander's
Ragtime Band,</i>

2423
01:54:39,596 --> 01:54:41,015
the number we did
when we played here.

2424
01:54:42,224 --> 01:54:43,309
Thank you.

2425
01:54:43,392 --> 01:54:45,352
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Five Donahues.

2426
01:54:57,406 --> 01:54:59,616
<i>Come on and hear,
come on and hear</i>

2427
01:54:59,658 --> 01:55:01,910
<i>Alexander's
Ragtime Band</i>

2428
01:55:01,994 --> 01:55:03,954
<i>Come on and hear,
come on and hear</i>

2429
01:55:04,038 --> 01:55:06,165
<i>It's the best band
in the land</i>

2430
01:55:06,248 --> 01:55:09,001
<i>And if you care
to hear the Swanee River</i>

2431
01:55:09,084 --> 01:55:11,086
<i>Played in ragtime</i>

2432
01:55:11,170 --> 01:55:13,172
<i>Come on and hear,
come on and hear</i>

2433
01:55:13,255 --> 01:55:15,883
<i>Alexander's Ragtime</i>

2434
01:55:15,966 --> 01:55:19,094
<i>That raggy beat,
gets in your feet</i>

2435
01:55:19,178 --> 01:55:20,888
<i>Come on and meet</i>

2436
01:55:20,971 --> 01:55:23,641
<i>Alexander's</i>

2437
01:55:23,682 --> 01:55:26,518
<i>Ragtime Band</i>

2438
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:28,812
<i>There's no business
like show business</i>

2439
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:30,606
<i>There's no business</i>

2440
01:55:30,689 --> 01:55:32,608
<i>That's half so thrilling</i>

2441
01:55:32,691 --> 01:55:35,861
<i>The cowboys, the tumblers,
the wrestlers, the clowns</i>

2442
01:55:35,944 --> 01:55:39,156
<i>The roustabouts
that move the show at dawn</i>

2443
01:55:39,198 --> 01:55:42,743
<i>The music, the spotlights,
the people, the towns</i>

2444
01:55:42,826 --> 01:55:45,704
<i>The thrill of that applause
when you go on</i>

2445
01:55:45,746 --> 01:55:49,333
<i>You're standing out in front
on opening nights</i>

2446
01:55:49,375 --> 01:55:52,544
<i>And there's your billing
right up there in lights</i>

2447
01:55:52,628 --> 01:55:56,131
<i>There's no people
like show people</i>

2448
01:55:56,215 --> 01:55:59,677

<i>Still you wouldn't
change it</i>

2452
01:56:07,810 --> 01:56:09,353
<i>For a sack of gold</i>

2453
01:56:09,436 --> 01:56:12,815
<i>You go on with the show</i>

2454
01:56:12,898 --> 01:56:15,985
