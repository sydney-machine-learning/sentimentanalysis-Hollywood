1
00:02:07,712 --> 00:02:09,963
Now you take it from here, slugger.

2
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,480
Joey?

3
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,111
Joe Doyle!

4
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,867
All right. What do you want?

5
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,994
Hey, I got one of your birds.

6
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:43,121
I recognized him by the band.

7
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:47,125
Yeah, must be Danny-boy.
I lost him in the last race.

8
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,253
<i>Yeah, he flew into my coop.
Do ya want him?</i>

9
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,506
Well, I gotta watch myself these days.
You know what I mean?

10
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:57,177
Well, listen, don't worry.
I'll take him up to your loft.

11
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,346
Okay, I'll see you on the roof.

12
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,362
That a boy. That a boy.

13
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:17,530
Come on, fella. Come on.

14
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:20,283
<i>That a boy. Come on. Come on.</i>

15
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,369
- Hey.
- Hiya.

16
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:26,206
How goes?

17
00:03:26,374 --> 00:03:27,791
He's up on the roof.

18
00:03:27,917 --> 00:03:29,918
The pigeon?

19
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,586
Uh, yeah. It worked.

20
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,718
I think somebody fell off the roof.

21
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:48,228
He thought he was gonna sing
to the crime commission. He won't.

22
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,856
- I thought they was gonna talk to him.
- That's the idea.

23
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,359
I thought they was gonna talk to him
and get him to dummy up.

24
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:56,486
Maybe he gave 'em an argument.

25
00:03:56,612 --> 00:04:00,031
No, I figured the worst they were gonna do
was lean on him a little bit.

26
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:02,033
Like I said, maybe he gave 'em an argument.

27
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,744
He's been giving Johnny, the boss,
a lot of arguments lately.

28
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:10,041
- He wasn't a bad kid, that Joey.
- A canary.

29
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,753
Maybe he could sing, but he couldn't fly.

30
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,385
Hey, come on.

31
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,512
I'll buy you a drink.

32
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,067
Well, I'll be in there later, and-

33
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,403
Father Barry is here.

34
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:45,076
Same thing happened to my Andy
five years ago.

35
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:47,370
- You're Pop Doyle, the boy's father?
- That's right.

36
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,956
Looks like he fell off the roof,
or maybe he was pushed.

37
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,291
- Got any ideas?
- No.

38
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:54,752
He was the only longshoreman that had the guts
to talk to them crime investigators.

39
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,754
- Who asked you?
- Everybody knows that.

40
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:59,466
Shut up. If Joey took my advice,
he wouldn't be-

41
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,759
- Everybody knows that.
- I said shut up!

42
00:05:01,886 --> 00:05:03,761
Look, I know how you feel about cops...

43
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:06,139
but maybe if you could give me
some leads, I could-

44
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:08,224
<i>I kept telling him,
"Don't say nothing.</i>

45
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,478
<i>Keep quiet. You'll live longer."</i>

46
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,189
I've been on the docks all my life, boy...

47
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,399
and there's one thing I learned:

48
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,693
You don't ask no questions,
you don't answer no questions...

49
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,820
unless you want to wind up like that.

50
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:28,077
Edie. Edie, come here.

51
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:30,497
I want to talk to you.
Come with me.

52
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:34,709
Father, who'd wanna kill Joey?
Who'd wanna kill Joey?

53
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:39,422
Stay away from him. Stay away from him!
Stay away from him! Stay away from him!

54
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:41,549
Edie, Edie listen. Edie, Edie!

55
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:44,260
Edie, time and faith. Remember,
time and faith are great healers.

56
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:47,514
- Father, my brother's dead, and you talk about time and faith!
- I know.

57
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,767
- My brother was the best kid in the neighborhood, and everybody said so.
- Edie, listen.

58
00:05:50,893 --> 00:05:52,852
I'm in the church if you need me.

59
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,147
You're in the church if I need you?

60
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,359
Did you ever hear of a saint
hiding in a church?

61
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:03,821
I wanna know who killed my brother!

62
00:06:03,948 --> 00:06:06,324
What's the matter with you, punk?

63
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:16,751
Hey, boss, Packy wants another drink on the cuff.

64
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,878
- Give it to him!
- <i>All right.</i>

65
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:21,047
Here's your cut on the shape-up.

66
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:24,425
Eight hundred and ninety-one men,
three bucks a head, that's, uh...

67
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:26,511
$2,673.

68
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:28,073
Charley, you count them.

69
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:32,016
Got a banana boat in 46 tomorrow.

70
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,561
If we pull a walkout,
might mean a few bucks from the shippers.

71
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:37,272
- Them bananas go bad in a hurry.
- Ask two Gs.

72
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,607
<i>$2,673.</i>

73
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,902
These clowns can't fight.

74
00:06:43,946 --> 00:06:46,531
There's nobody tough anymore.

75
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:48,908
- Hiya, slugger.
- Hi there, Johnny.

76
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,410
Hi, kid.

77
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:54,330
Look out, now!
Don't hit me. Don't hit me!

78
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,126
Where's Morgan?
Where's that big banker of mine?

79
00:06:58,252 --> 00:07:01,421
- Right here, Mr. Friendly.
- Hiya, J.P. How's business?

80
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:03,423
Having trouble with Kelly again, boss.

81
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,259
He won't take no loans,
and Big Mac puts him to work anyway.

82
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:08,678
- He's my wife's nephew.
- But he won't take no loans!

83
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,431
<i>I gotta put him to work!
She'd murder me!</i>

84
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:13,725
<i>That's why I never got married.</i>

85
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:17,061
<i>Here's the interest on the day, boss: $532.</i>

86
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,939
Here, you count it.
Countin' makes me sleepy.

87
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:23,318
Hey, Skins, you handle
that sheet metal all right?

88
00:07:23,444 --> 00:07:26,112
Yeah, it was easy. The new checker
faked the receipt. Here it is.

89
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,364
When you talk to me,
take the cigar out of your mouth.

90
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,950
- Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
- Yeah, sure. Yeah.

91
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,244
Here you are- 45 bills.

92
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,788
Hey, Terry, you count this.

93
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:40,418
Go on. It's good for you.
It develops your mind.

94
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,796
- What mind?
- Shut up. I like the kid.

95
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,841
Remember the night he took Farella
at St. Nick's, Charley, huh?

96
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:50,386
We won a bundle.
Real tough. Big try.

97
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,722
I lost the count.

98
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:57,143
Okay. Forget it, Einstein.

99
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:59,979
How come you never got an education
like your brother Charley here?

100
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,983
The only arithmetic he ever got
was hearing the referee count up to ten.

101
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,111
You know, you're not too funny today, fat man.

102
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,656
<i>Hey!</i>

103
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:12,825
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley?
He ain't himself.

104
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,995
It's just the Joey Doyle thing
and how he exaggerates the thing.

105
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:18,081
Just too much Marquis of Queensbury.

106
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:21,376
- <i>It softens him up.</i>
- Listen, kid, I'm a soft touch too.

107
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:23,920
Ask any rummy on the dock
if I ain't good for a fin...

108
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:26,005
anytime they put the arm on me.

109
00:08:27,383 --> 00:08:29,384
But my old lady raised us ten kids...

110
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,845
on a stinkin' watchman's pension.

111
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:36,557
When I was 16,
I had to beg for work in the hold.

112
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:40,395
I didn't work my way up outta there for nothin'.

113
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,438
Look, I know that, Johnny.
I know it.

114
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,565
Takin' over this local took a little doin'.

115
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:47,860
There was some pretty rough fellas in the way.
They give me this to remember 'em by.

116
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:49,904
He had to keep his hand over his throat...

117
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,115
to stay alive, and he still went after them.

118
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:55,451
- I know it.
- I know what's eatin' you.

119
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,705
Well, I got 2,000 dues-payin' members in this local.

120
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:02,542
That's $72,000 a year legitimate.

121
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,919
And when each one puts in
a couple of bucks a day...

122
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,004
just to make sure the work's steady...

123
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:09,048
well, figure it out.

124
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:12,093
And that's just for openers.
We got the fattest piers...

125
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,095
in the fattest harbor in the world.

126
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,305
Everything moves in and out,
we take our cut.

127
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:20,601
Why shouldn't we?
If we can get it, we're entitled to it.

128
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:24,856
You don't suppose I can afford to be boxed
out of a deal like this, do you...

129
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:28,651
a deal I sweated and bled for,
on account of one lousy little cheese-eater-

130
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,864
that Doyle bum- who thinks he can go
squealin' to the crime commission, do ya?

131
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,329
Well, do ya?

132
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:45,752
Well, no, Johnny.
I just figured I shoulda been told.

133
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:48,629
I make it $2,623.

134
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:51,090
You're $50 short, Skins.

135
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,015
Gimme.

136
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,767
I must've miscounted.

137
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,560
Gimme.

138
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,270
Gimme!

139
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:13,488
You come from Greenpoint- go back to Greenpoint.
You don't work here no more.

140
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,539
Here, kid. Here's half a bill.
Go get your load on.

141
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:27,627
- No, I'm okay, Johnny. Thanks.
- Go on. A present from your Uncle Johnny.

142
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,629
And Mac...

143
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:33,966
tomorrow mornin' when you shape the men,
put Terry up in the loft- number one.

144
00:10:34,092 --> 00:10:36,177
- Sure, why not?
- Every day.

145
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:37,804
It's nice, easy work, see?

146
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,932
You check in and you goof off
on a coffee bag. Okay?

147
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:42,517
Okay.

148
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:48,231
<i>Hey.</i>

149
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,525
You got a real friend here.

150
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,652
Now, don't forget it.

151
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,570
Why should he forget it?

152
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,406
Yeah. Thanks, Johnny.

153
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,834
All right. Payday.

154
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,169
Barney.

155
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,255
Mac.

156
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,131
Truck.

157
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,404
Hi, Terry.

158
00:11:38,407 --> 00:11:41,367
- Hiya, kid.
- I was just gonna feed 'em.

159
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:43,202
I already fed 'em.

160
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,371
You must've been up early, huh?

161
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,207
I was up anyhow,
so I figured I might as well.

162
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:53,087
Boy, they sure got it made, huh?

163
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,965
Eatin', sleepin', flyin' around like crazy...

164
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,050
raisin' gobs of squabs.

165
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,891
Well, I better get over there.

166
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:15,192
Be careful. Don't spill no water on the floor,
'cause I don't want 'em to catch cold.

167
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,030
I'll see you around, huh?

168
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,832
Come on, Tony. Give me them tabs.

169
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,421
<i>He was a good boy, that Doyle kid.</i>

170
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,590
Sure he was.
That's why he got it in the head.

171
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,001
He couldn't learn to keep his mouth shut.

172
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:45,640
Pop?

173
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,100
Hey, Pop, why don't you go home?

174
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:50,937
- The boys who work today'll be chippin' in gladly.
- That's right, Pop.

175
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:54,649
No thanks, fellas. I'm gonna shape.
Who do you think'll pay for the funeral?

176
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:58,736
- Johnny Friendly, that great labor leader.
- That's a good one.

177
00:12:58,862 --> 00:13:01,113
Why don't you keep that big mouth of yours shut?

178
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,907
What are you, a wise guy?

179
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,952
If I was wise,
I wouldn't be no longshoreman for 30 years.

180
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,162
I'm poorer now than when I started.

181
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,248
- Wise guy.
- Big mouth.

182
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:14,126
- Don't mess with those guys.
- Oh, here.

183
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:17,713
I brought you Joey's windbreaker.
Might come in handy.

184
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,633
- Go ahead. Wear it, Kayo.
- Thanks, Pop.

185
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,970
Mine's more full of holes
than the Pittsburgh infield.

186
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,763
- Hey, Joe.
- Yeah, yeah.

187
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,348
I got a coat for you.

188
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:41,278
Say, do you know Terry Malloy?

189
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:43,489
- No, I don't know him.
- Never heard of him.

190
00:13:46,952 --> 00:13:49,328
Say, you're Terry Malloy, aren't you?

191
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,498
So what?

192
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:54,959
Didn't I see you fight a couple of years ago?

193
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,254
Without the birdseed- whadda ya want?

194
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,715
Oh, uh, our identification.

195
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,929
"Waterfront Crime Commission."
What's that?

196
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,931
I just want to ask you a few questions.

197
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,475
See, we're getting ready to hold
public hearings on waterfront crime...

198
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:13,519
and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.

199
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,522
- I don't know nothin'.
- You haven't heard the questions yet.

200
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,984
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

201
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,071
There's a rumor that you're one of the last people
to see Joey Doyle alive.

202
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:25,781
Well, I don't know nothin'.

203
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:28,367
- Nobody's accusing you of anything, Mr. Malloy.
- I hope you understand that.

204
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:31,328
Just want to ask you some questions
about some people you may know.

205
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:38,252
- People I may know?
- <i>That's right.</i>

206
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:42,214
- You better get outta here, buster.
- <i>Now, slow down, boy, huh?</i>

207
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,011
I don't know nothin', I ain't seen nothin',
and I'm not sayin' nothin'.

208
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:49,055
So why don't you and your girlfriend
just take off?

209
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,474
All right, Mr. Malloy.
You have every right not to talk...

210
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,392
if that's what you choose to do.

211
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,103
- The public has a right to know the facts too.
- Yeah. All right.

212
00:14:56,229 --> 00:15:00,191
- We'll be seeing you again.
- Never is gonna be too much soon for me, shorty.

213
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,402
Take it easy.

214
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:07,865
How do you like them mugs,
takin' me for a pigeon?

215
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:10,326
- Who was it?
- I don't know who they are.

216
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:14,246
You're three weeks behind on the last $25,
but I'm willing to take a chance.

217
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,958
Some chance at ten percent a week.
And if we don't borrow, we don't work.

218
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:20,336
May you rot in hell, J.P.

219
00:15:20,462 --> 00:15:23,380
When I'm dead and gone,
you'll know what a friend I was.

220
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:26,467
Why don't you drop dead now
so we can test your theory?

221
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,636
Condolences.

222
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:31,097
Hey, Pop, look.

223
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,729
All right. Let her go, Tony.

224
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,456
I guess I spoke out of turn last night.

225
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:03,921
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider
with a turned-around collar.

226
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,399
Don't you?

227
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,805
I see the sisters taught you not to lie.

228
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:18,602
All right. Loften, Malloy...

229
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:22,148
Hendricks, Prochowski...

230
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,316
- Westerfield, McGryer.
- Three forty-one.

231
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,778
- Three forty-eight.
- <i>Seventy-one.</i>

232
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,531
I've been thinking about your question, and, uh...

233
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,658
you're right, Edie.

234
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:36,036
This is my parish.

235
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,581
I don't know how much I can do,
but I'll never find out...

236
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:42,126
unless I come down here
and take a good look for myself.

237
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:45,129
All right, I need some extra banana carriers.

238
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:49,508
Bananas again. I wonder when we're gonna get a boat
from Ireland with some good Irish whiskey on it.

239
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,720
Dugan, my boy, you're dreamin' again.

240
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,763
All right. Kelly.

241
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,726
Richie.

242
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,236
Yeah, you.

243
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:14,033
What's the matter?
Nobody wanna work today?

244
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:17,912
Yeah, you.

245
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,417
Yeah, you.

246
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,880
Hey, who do you see to get
a day's pay around here?

247
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:45,231
- Meatballs.
- Definitely.

248
00:17:51,446 --> 00:17:53,572
Come here!

249
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,450
Hey, Terry! Grab that one!

250
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,698
Give me that!

251
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:07,002
- Give it to me!
- What? What?

252
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,346
Give it to me!

253
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:11,757
- Give me that!
- What makes you so special?

254
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:13,759
Things are lookin' up on the docks.

255
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,928
Don't you recognize her, dopey?
That's Joey Doyle's sister.

256
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,138
You give me that!

257
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,434
You Joey Doyle's sister?

258
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,395
Yes, I am.

259
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,105
Yeah.

260
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:28,315
You don't wanna go to work today anyhow.

261
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,819
Well, it's been nice wrestlin' with ya.

262
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,075
Edie.

263
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,869
Pop? Here's your tab. Take it.

264
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,999
All right. Give it to me.
I can use it.

265
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,960
Now get back to the sisters where you belong.

266
00:18:48,128 --> 00:18:51,130
I'm surprised at you, Father,
if you don't mind my saying so...

267
00:18:51,298 --> 00:18:55,175
lettin' her see things ain't fit
for the eyes of a decent girl.

268
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:58,137
<i>All right, that's all.
Come back tomorrow.</i>

269
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,644
Hey, what do you do now?

270
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:07,813
Like Big Mac said, come back tomorrow.

271
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,940
Tomorrow? No ship tomorrow.

272
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,151
I've been standin' here
for five straight mornings...

273
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,486
and that bum over there
looks right through you.

274
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,823
You can't be around here.
Come on. Get outta here.

275
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,284
I'm sorry, Father. I didn't mean it.

276
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,996
- What do you wanna do?
- Come on. Let's go get a bowl.

277
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:27,166
Wait a minute. Is this all you do-
just take it like this?

278
00:19:29,252 --> 00:19:31,045
What about your union?

279
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:38,218
No other union in the country
would stand for a thing like that.

280
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:42,014
The waterfront's tougher, Father.
Like it ain't part of America.

281
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,601
- You know how a trigger local works, Father?
- No. How?

282
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:48,187
You get up in a meetin',
you make a motion...

283
00:19:48,313 --> 00:19:50,397
the lights go out, then you go out.

284
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:54,026
That's how it's been ever since Johnny
and his cowboys took over the local.

285
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,612
Name one place where it's safe
to even talk without gettin' clobbered.

286
00:19:56,738 --> 00:19:57,988
The church.

287
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,948
What?

288
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,744
The bottom of the church.

289
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,913
<i>You know what you're lettin' yourself in for?</i>

290
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,585
- You got a cigarette on you?
- Yeah.

291
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,056
Right over there.

292
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,687
Hey.

293
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:33,899
- You working hard?
- Yeah.

294
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,984
You wouldn't mind working once in a while...

295
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:38,654
just to justify this lofty position, would you?

296
00:20:40,073 --> 00:20:42,366
I finished the work.
I counted all them bags.

297
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:46,787
We have an extra detail for you-
that's if you don't mind...

298
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,248
being disturbed or anything.

299
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:53,293
The priest and this Doyle girl are gettin'
a meeting together down at the church...

300
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,587
and we, uh- we want a rundown on it-

301
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,881
you know, the names and the numbers
of all the players.

302
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,759
Wait a minute.
All right. You're nominated.

303
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:04,513
Well, why me, Charley?
I feel funny goin' down there.

304
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:07,766
- Besides, I'd just be stoolin' for you.
- Let me tell you what stooling is.

305
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,561
Stooling is when you rat on your friends,
the guys you're with.

306
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,438
- Yeah.
- But if Johnny wants a favor...

307
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,607
don't think about it- do it.

308
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,777
Now, go on. Join the congregation.

309
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:38,380
Well, I thought there'd be more of you here, but-

310
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:43,093
The- The Romans found out what a handful could do...

311
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,929
if it's the right handful.

312
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,644
I'm just a potato-eater, but...
isn't it simple as one, two, three?

313
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,147
One: The working conditions are bad.

314
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:57,191
Two: They're bad because the mob does the hiring.

315
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,443
And three: The only way we can break the mob...

316
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:01,695
is to stop letting them get away with murder.

317
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,822
<i>Now, if one of you would just answer one question...</i>

318
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,949
<i>we'd have a start, a very good start.</i>

319
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,951
<i>And that question is...</i>

320
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,662
who killed Joey Doyle?

321
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:21,048
Not one of you has a line
on who killed Joey Doyle?

322
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,180
I have a hunch all of you
could tell us something about it.

323
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,267
<i>All right, then answer this one:</i>

324
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,478
<i>How can we call ourselves Christians...</i>

325
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,813
<i>and protect these murderers with our silence?</i>

326
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:45,322
Jimmy Collins, you were Joey's best friend.

327
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,158
How can you just sit there
and not say anything?

328
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:50,869
And I'll always think of him
as my best friend.

329
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,664
- But what do you want me to-
- Who asked him in here?

330
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:57,543
I'm just trying to find out
what happened to Joey Doyle.

331
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:00,212
- <i>Maybe you can be helpful.</i>
- "Helpful"?

332
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:04,216
The brother of Charley the Gent?
They'll help us get to the bottom of the river.

333
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,218
Better leave Charley outta this.

334
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:08,136
You don't think he'd be "helpful"?

335
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:10,305
Why don't you ask him yourself?

336
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:12,432
<i>Maybe I will one of these days.</i>

337
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,769
"One of these days."

338
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,981
Now, listen. You know who the pistols are.

339
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:23,402
You going to keep still
until they cut you down one by one?

340
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,572
Are you?

341
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:29,491
Hey, Dugan, how about you?

342
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:33,745
One thing you gotta understand, Father:
On the dock we've always been D and D.

343
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:36,123
- "D and D"-- what's that?
- Deaf and dumb.

344
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:39,084
No matter how much we hate the torpedoes,
we don't rat.

345
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,879
"Rat"? Now, boys, get smart.

346
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:45,424
I know you're gettin' pushed around, but...

347
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,552
there's one thing we've got in this country,
and that's ways of fightin' back.

348
00:23:48,678 --> 00:23:51,888
<i>Now, getting the facts to the public,
testifying for what you know is right...</i>

349
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,640
<i>against what you know is wrong.</i>

350
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,059
<i>And what's ratting to them
is telling the truth for you.</i>

351
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,936
<i>Can't you see that?</i>

352
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:01,066
Can't you see that?

353
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:22,294
It seems to me we've gone just about
as far as we can at this time.

354
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:24,421
I think you'll agree with that, Father.

355
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:28,634
So I'd like to close
with a few words from St. Matthew.

356
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,927
"Come unto me, all ye-"

357
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:42,314
What did I tell you, sticking your neck out?
This is a police problem, not ours!

358
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:45,025
- These people need our help, Vince.
- Okay! Okay!

359
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,152
Only don't blame me
when they ship you off to Abyssinia.

360
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,987
I won't.

361
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:58,747
You'd better go home in pairs.
Two's is two, you know.

362
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,334
Come on!

363
00:25:04,921 --> 00:25:08,131
- Pop! Pop!
- Come here. Don't go out there.

364
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,764
No, no. Come here.

365
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:21,687
Edie! Edie!

366
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,080
What happened to Pop?

367
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:42,541
He's an old man. They won't hurt him.

368
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:45,836
Get out, you!

369
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,385
Here, talk to me.
Are you all right, Dugan?

370
00:25:53,553 --> 00:25:56,221
Yeah, considerin' they were usin' my head
for a baseball.

371
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,515
Are you still D and D?
You still call it ratting?

372
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,559
- Are you on the level?
- What do you think?

373
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,937
If I stick my neck out and they chop it off,
would that be the end of it...

374
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:06,189
- or are you willing to go all the way?
- Down the line.

375
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:08,150
They'll put the muscle on you too...

376
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,402
turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.

377
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,404
Here, wipe your face. Listen to me.

378
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,448
You stand up, and I'll stand up with you.

379
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:17,576
- Right down the wire?
- So help me God.

380
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:22,956
I think we're okay.

381
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:25,041
Steel pipes and baseball bats.

382
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:27,377
Well, they play pretty rough around here.

383
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,546
Well, I can make it home now all right.

384
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:31,590
Okay.

385
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:34,342
Which side are you with?

386
00:26:34,469 --> 00:26:36,887
Me? I'm with me. Terry.

387
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:39,556
Hey, you got a dime for a cup of coffee?

388
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,433
Beat it, will ya?

389
00:26:41,601 --> 00:26:43,560
Just a little dime you don't need?

390
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:47,105
Hey, I know you.

391
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:49,191
You're Edie Doyle.

392
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:51,276
- Come on, beat it.
- Your brother was a saint.

393
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,737
He's the only one who ever tried
to get me compensation.

394
00:26:53,863 --> 00:26:55,781
What are you doin'?
Get outta here, will ya?

395
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:58,241
You remember, Terry.
You was there that night-

396
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,410
- Get outta here.
- You remember.

397
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,829
Get outta here!

398
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:06,124
Here's some change.
Go have yourself a ball.

399
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,210
You don't buy me.

400
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:10,420
You're still a bum.

401
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,631
So long, Edie.

402
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,716
Lord have mercy on Joey.

403
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,969
Who's callin' me a bum?

404
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:23,433
Everybody loved Joey.

405
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,936
From little kids to the old rummies.

406
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,315
Did you know him very well?

407
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:34,152
Well, you know, he got around.

408
00:27:35,655 --> 00:27:38,490
- What did that man mean just now?
- Don't pay no attention to him.

409
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,867
He's drunk, he's falling down, everything.

410
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,787
He's just a juicehead
that hangs around the neighborhood.

411
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:46,039
Don't pay no attention.

412
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,041
I'd better go now.

413
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,836
You don't have to be afraid of me.
I'm not gonna bite ya.

414
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:55,757
I guess they don't let you walk with fellas
where you've been, huh?

415
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:57,843
You know how the sisters are.

416
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:00,554
Yeah. Are you training to be a nun?

417
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,722
It's just a regular college.

418
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,683
Wait a second.

419
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:07,727
It's run by the Sisters of St. Anne.

420
00:28:07,854 --> 00:28:09,896
Where is that?

421
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:11,857
It's in Tarrytown.

422
00:28:11,983 --> 00:28:15,569
- Where is that?
- In the country.

423
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:18,405
I don't like the country.
The crickets make me nervous.

424
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:23,952
So how often do you get in here?

425
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:27,706
I guess I haven't been here
since last Christmas.

426
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:31,126
We were gonna have a Thanksgiving party.

427
00:28:32,795 --> 00:28:35,005
That's nice.

428
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:38,842
What do you do up there?
Just- What? Study?

429
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,886
I want to be a teacher.

430
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,972
A teacher? That's very good. You know-

431
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:47,726
Personally, I admire brains.
My brother Charley is a very brainy guy.

432
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:50,562
He done a couple of years of college.

433
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:55,108
It isn't just brains.
It's- It's how you use them.

434
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,485
Yeah, I get your thought.

435
00:28:57,612 --> 00:28:59,988
You know, I've seen you
a lot of times before.

436
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:03,325
Remember parochial school on Pulaski Street?

437
00:29:03,451 --> 00:29:06,411
Seven, eight years ago?
Your hair- Had your hair, uh-

438
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:08,413
Braids. That's right.

439
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,498
Looked like a hunk of rope.

440
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:13,209
You had wires on your teeth, and...

441
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:15,211
glasses, everything.

442
00:29:15,338 --> 00:29:17,923
You was really a mess.

443
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,176
I can get home all right now, thanks.

444
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:23,720
Hey, listen, don't get sore.
I'm just kiddin' you a little bit.

445
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:26,556
I just mean to tell you that you...

446
00:29:26,682 --> 00:29:29,017
grew up very nice.

447
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:31,102
Thanks.

448
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,272
You don't-
You don't remember me, do you?

449
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,401
I remembered you the first moment I saw you.

450
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:41,279
By the nose, huh?

451
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:47,953
Well, some people just got faces
that stick in your mind.

452
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:52,415
I remember you were in trouble all the time.

453
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,626
Now you got me.

454
00:29:54,794 --> 00:29:58,630
Boy, the way those sisters used to whack me,
I don't know what.

455
00:29:59,674 --> 00:30:03,301
They thought they was gonna beat
an education into me, but I foxed 'em.

456
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,723
Maybe they just didn't know
how to handle you.

457
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,558
How would you have done it?

458
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,855
With a little more patience and kindness.

459
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:20,402
That's what makes people mean and difficult:
People don't care enough about them.

460
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,660
What, are you kiddin' me?

461
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:30,578
Come on. I'd better get you home.

462
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:34,249
There's too many guys around here
with only one thing on their mind.

463
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,168
Am I gonna see you again?

464
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,965
What for?

465
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,303
I don't know.

466
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,019
- I really don't know.
- Come on.

467
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:00,734
Come on.

468
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,044
All right. You're all packed.

469
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:22,881
Here's your bus ticket,
and you're on your way back to St. Anne's.

470
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:26,968
- I'm not ready to go back yet, Pop.
- Edie, for years your mom and me...

471
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,721
put quarters into the cookie jar...

472
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,931
to keep you up there with the sisters...

473
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:35,143
keep you from things
like I just seen outside the window.

474
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,813
A daughter of mine walkin' arm in arm
with Terry Malloy.

475
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:41,816
- You know who Terry Malloy is?
- Who is he, Pop?

476
00:31:41,942 --> 00:31:44,336
<i>He's the kid brother of Charley the Gent...</i>

477
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:49,240
<i>who is Johnny Friendly's right hand,
and a butcher in a camel-hair coat.</i>

478
00:31:50,743 --> 00:31:53,078
You tryin' to tell me Terry is too?

479
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,246
He tries to act tough...

480
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,542
but there's a look in his eye.

481
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,069
Yeah, a look in his eye.

482
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:04,798
Hold your hats, brothers.
Here we go again.

483
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:07,092
Do you think he's one of them cases you're always...

484
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,469
draggin' into the house
and feelin' sorry for...

485
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:12,430
like that litter of kittens
you brought in?

486
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:15,600
The only one you wanted to keep...

487
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:18,478
had six toes and was cockeyed to boot.

488
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:21,523
Look at him, the little bum.

489
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,608
He said he wants to see me again.

490
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,780
Look.

491
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:32,492
See this arm?

492
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,330
Two inches longer than the other.

493
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,541
That's from years of workin'...

494
00:32:39,667 --> 00:32:42,127
and sweatin' and liftin'...

495
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:44,629
and swingin' a hook.

496
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:49,717
Every time I hoist a box or a coffee bag...

497
00:32:49,844 --> 00:32:52,178
I says to meself, "That's for Edie...

498
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,764
so she can be a teacher
or somethin' decent."

499
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,142
Oh, Pop!

500
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,352
I promised your mom, Edie.

501
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,563
Don't let her down.

502
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:03,565
Pop...

503
00:33:03,691 --> 00:33:07,652
I don't want you to think that I'm not grateful
for everything you've done-

504
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:11,948
for giving me the education,
for keeping me away from all of this.

505
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:14,701
But Pop, I've seen things
that I know are so wrong.

506
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:18,997
How can I got back to school and keep my mind
on things that are just in books?

507
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:21,374
That- That aren't people living?

508
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:24,294
I'm gonna stay, Pop...

509
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:28,298
and I'm gonna keep on trying to find out
who is guilty for Joey.

510
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:01,206
Heads up!

511
00:34:17,223 --> 00:34:18,514
Hi.

512
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,725
What are you doin' up here on the roof?

513
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,854
Just looking.

514
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:28,566
Take a look at the champion flock
of the neighborhood.

515
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,862
Fly pretty nice, huh?

516
00:34:34,031 --> 00:34:36,616
"Golden Warriors"?

517
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:40,078
Yeah. I started the Golden Warriors.

518
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:44,749
You might say that I was
the original Golden Warrior.

519
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:47,877
Hey. This bum here is my shadow.

520
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,838
He thinks I'm a tough man
'cause I boxed pro for a while.

521
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:54,592
<i>Think you're a tough guy, huh?</i>

522
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:58,721
- <i>Joey used to raise pigeons.</i>
- Get outta here.

523
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,225
Joey used to raise pigeons.

524
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:05,770
Yeah, he had a few birds.

525
00:35:08,691 --> 00:35:11,234
I've been takin' care of 'em.

526
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,904
I wouldn't have thought
you'd be so interested in pigeons.

527
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:18,449
I just go for it.

528
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,748
You know this city is full of hawks?
That's a fact.

529
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:28,835
They hang around on top of the big hotels...

530
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:32,171
and they spot a pigeon in the park-

531
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,799
<i>Right down on 'em.</i>

532
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:38,469
You got a second? One second?

533
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,308
I wanna show you something.

534
00:35:52,026 --> 00:35:54,819
Here you are.
What do you think of that fella?

535
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,654
She's a beauty.

536
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:59,449
She's a he. His name is Swifty.

537
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,493
Oh, look what he went and did.

538
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:08,041
<i>He's my lead bird.</i>

539
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:10,752
He's always on top of the perch.

540
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:14,839
If another bum tries to come along
and take his place, he really lets him have it.

541
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:19,344
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.

542
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:23,890
Well, one thing about 'em, though:
They're very faithful.

543
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:29,145
- They get married just like people.
- Better.

544
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,356
And they stay that way
till one of 'em dies.

545
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:34,692
That's nice.

546
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:42,367
Hey, go ahead. Fix the roof.

547
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,207
Here. You want that egg?

548
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,753
Thanks.

549
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:59,300
Do you like beer?

550
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,679
I don't know.

551
00:37:05,182 --> 00:37:07,642
I'll bet you never had a glass of beer.

552
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:11,062
- You ever have a glass of beer?
- No.

553
00:37:14,608 --> 00:37:16,567
Wanna have one with me?

554
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:19,862
In a saloon?

555
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,739
Well, yeah.

556
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:24,200
I mean, I know a nice little dump down there that...

557
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:27,578
got a special entrance for ladies,
and all like that.

558
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:32,750
Come on. It won't hurt.

559
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,922
Come on.

560
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,928
Yeah? Good.

561
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:51,561
- Hey, Mac?
- Yeah.

562
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:54,272
Two Glockenheimers and two for chasers.

563
00:37:54,398 --> 00:37:57,608
Yeah. See the fight last night?

564
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:00,820
- No.
- Kid named Riley. Both hands.

565
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,905
Like you used to do.

566
00:38:04,131 --> 00:38:06,117
I hope he got better dice than me.

567
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:08,786
Comedian.

568
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:12,248
Are you really a prizefighter?

569
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:15,418
I used to be.

570
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:19,338
How did you get interested in that?

571
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:22,633
Well, I don't know.
I had to scrap all my life.

572
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:25,303
I might as well get paid for it.

573
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,638
When I was a kid,
my old man got bumped off, and-

574
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:30,808
and, uh- never mind how.

575
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,561
And they stuck Charley and me in a-

576
00:38:33,687 --> 00:38:36,439
a dump they call a children's home.

577
00:38:38,317 --> 00:38:40,860
Oh, boy, that was some home.

578
00:38:40,986 --> 00:38:44,113
Well, anyhow, I ran away from there...

579
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,240
and I fought in the club smokers
and peddled papers...

580
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,242
and Johnny Friendly bought a piece of me.

581
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,328
Bought a piece of you?

582
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:52,538
Yes.

583
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:56,292
Then, uh, I was goin' pretty good there
for a while.

584
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,295
And after that, uh-

585
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:03,049
Well, I don't know.

586
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:05,259
What do you really care?
Am I right?

587
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:11,516
Shouldn't everybody care about everybody else?

588
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:16,312
Oh, what a fruitcake you are.

589
00:39:16,438 --> 00:39:20,483
I mean, isn't everybody
a part of everybody else?

590
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:22,777
And you really believe that drool?

591
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:24,695
Yes, I do.

592
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:30,284
Well, here we are.
One for the lady and for the gent.

593
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:34,497
Here's to the first one.
I hope it ain't the last.

594
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:35,999
Tink.

595
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,709
Go ahead.

596
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:44,674
Good?

597
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,051
No, not like that. One hump.

598
00:39:58,272 --> 00:40:01,357
Hey, you wanna hear my philosophy of life?

599
00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:06,529
Do it to him before he does it to you.

600
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,157
I never met anyone like you.

601
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:13,911
There's not a- a spark...

602
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,581
of sentiment or romance...

603
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,749
or human kindness in your whole body.

604
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,294
What good does it do you
besides get you in trouble?

605
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,171
And when things and people
get in your way...

606
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:27,091
you just knock them aside,
get rid of them- is that your idea?

607
00:40:27,217 --> 00:40:29,093
Listen, don't look at me
when you say that.

608
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:32,513
It wasn't my fault what happened to Joey.
Fixin' him wasn't my idea.

609
00:40:34,641 --> 00:40:36,434
Who said it was?

610
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,645
Well, everybody's puttin' the needle on me-

611
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,440
you and them mugs in the church
and Father Barry.

612
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:44,442
I didn't like the way he was lookin' at me.

613
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:46,944
He was looking at everybody the same way.

614
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:49,155
Oh, yeah?

615
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:53,159
Anyhow, what's with this Father Barry?
What's his racket?

616
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:56,954
- His racket?
- Yeah, his racket. Everybody's got a racket.

617
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,706
But he's a priest.

618
00:40:58,832 --> 00:41:01,208
Are you kiddin'? So what?
That don't make no difference.

619
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:03,961
You don't believe anybody, do you?

620
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,672
Listen, down here it's every man for himself.

621
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,674
It's keepin' alive.

622
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,345
It's standin' in with the right people so you get
a little bit of change jinglin' in your pocket.

623
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:14,597
- And if you don't?
- If you don't-

624
00:41:14,723 --> 00:41:17,224
right down.

625
00:41:17,351 --> 00:41:19,435
It's living like an animal.

626
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:22,938
All right, then. I'd rather live
like an animal than end up like-

627
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:25,191
Like Joey?

628
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,443
Are you afraid to mention his name?

629
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:29,695
No.

630
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:32,657
Well, what do you keep harpin' on that for?

631
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:37,453
Come on, drink up.
You gotta get a little fun outta life.

632
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:40,122
Come on. I'll stick some music on.

633
00:41:46,338 --> 00:41:48,297
What's the matter?

634
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:59,183
What's the matter?
What's the matter with you?

635
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,189
Help me if you can, for God sakes.

636
00:42:08,694 --> 00:42:11,362
Edie, I'd like to help.

637
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:14,198
I'd like to help,
but there's nothing I can do.

638
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:18,035
All right.

639
00:42:20,539 --> 00:42:22,707
I shouldn't have asked you.

640
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:27,253
Here, come on. Have a little beer.

641
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:29,338
Come on, come on.

642
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,883
I don't want it.

643
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:38,389
You just stay here and finish your drink.

644
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:41,225
Oh, no, no. Listen, don't go.

645
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:43,519
I got my whole life to drink.

646
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:50,901
Are you sore at me?

647
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:56,240
What for?

648
00:42:56,366 --> 00:42:58,617
Well, I don't know.

649
00:42:58,744 --> 00:43:00,911
For not-

650
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,372
For not bein' no help to you.

651
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:10,504
You would if you could.

652
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:24,310
Here I come!

653
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:26,687
Pick a winner.

654
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:30,065
Wait a minute.
First I gotta kiss the bride.

655
00:43:30,192 --> 00:43:32,109
Come on, you kissed her before.

656
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,456
You can get out that way.
You want me to take you?

657
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,132
- What's goin' on here?
- Gimme a cigarette.

658
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,551
You gotta stop smokin' so much.

659
00:43:59,471 --> 00:44:01,472
Come on. We can get out through here.

660
00:44:02,998 --> 00:44:04,517
What's the matter with you?

661
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,484
- Come on.
- That's a pretty tune.

662
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:20,491
Here's a stick of gum.

663
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:22,827
It'll do you good.

664
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,995
- Thank you.
- Do you like that music?

665
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,463
If I had my tuxedo,
I'd ask you to dance, but-

666
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:39,218
Come on. You wanna- you wanna spin?

667
00:44:43,473 --> 00:44:46,183
Come on. Don't be afraid.

668
00:44:46,709 --> 00:44:48,310
You dance divinely.

669
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,283
Say, we're doing pretty good.

670
00:45:02,409 --> 00:45:04,368
The sisters ought to see you now.

671
00:45:07,581 --> 00:45:09,415
Wait a minute.

672
00:45:12,878 --> 00:45:15,129
I feel like I'm just floating.

673
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:18,424
Just floating.

674
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,303
Just floating.

675
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,475
Hey!

676
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:33,022
I been lookin' all over for you, Terry.
The boss wants you.

677
00:45:34,816 --> 00:45:36,483
Right now?

678
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:39,361
Yeah, he just got a call from Mr. Upstairs.

679
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:42,323
Something's gone wrong.
He's plenty hot.

680
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:46,660
- I wanna take her home first.
- I wouldn't. I'll see the little lady home.

681
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:50,414
<i>Just tell him I'll come over there
when I'm ready.</i>

682
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:53,751
Hey, Ed, wait up!

683
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:57,338
Who was that?

684
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:02,509
I don't know. Some mug.

685
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:05,763
Who was he?

686
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:10,476
Edie, you gotta quit tryin'
to find out about Joey. It ain't safe.

687
00:46:10,602 --> 00:46:13,062
Now, I'm telling you, it ain't safe.

688
00:46:13,188 --> 00:46:16,148
Mr. Malloy, I was hoping
I might find you here.

689
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:20,235
Excuse me, miss. You're being served
with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.

690
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:24,198
- A what?
- Be at the statehouse, courtroom nine...

691
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:26,742
10:00 Friday morning.

692
00:46:26,868 --> 00:46:29,203
What's the matter? I told you,
I don't know nothin' about that.

693
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:33,165
You can bring a lawyer if you wish.
You're privileged under the Constitution...

694
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:36,502
to protect yourself against questions
which might implicate you in any crimes.

695
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,507
Listen, you know what they're askin' me to do?

696
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:44,385
All we want you to do, Mr. Malloy,
is tell the truth.

697
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:48,263
Good night, kid.

698
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:50,265
Nice wedding.

699
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:55,771
What are you gonna do?

700
00:46:56,856 --> 00:47:00,317
I ain't gonna eat cheese for no cops,
and that's for sure!

701
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:08,742
It was Johnny Friendly
who had Joey killed, wasn't it?

702
00:47:08,868 --> 00:47:11,578
Or he had him killed.
He had something to do with it, didn't he?

703
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:13,664
He and your big brother, Charley?

704
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,876
You can't tell me, can you,
because you're a part of it.

705
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:21,672
Because you're just as bad as the worst of them.
Tell me the truth, Terry.

706
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,841
You'd better go back to that school
out in daisyland.

707
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:27,219
You're drivin' yourself nuts.
You're drivin' me nuts.

708
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:31,515
Quit worryin' about the truth all the time.
Worry about yourself.

709
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:33,934
I should have known you wouldn't tell me.

710
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:38,022
Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you.
Well, I think he still owns you.

711
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:43,027
No wonder everybody calls you a bum.

712
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:48,866
Don't say that to me, Edie.
Don't say that to me now.

713
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:52,119
No wonder. No wonder.

714
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:55,664
I'm only tryin' to help you out.
I'm tryin' to keep you from gettin' hurt.

715
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,167
What more do you want me to do?

716
00:47:58,293 --> 00:48:00,044
- Much more.
- Wait a minute.

717
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:02,546
Much, much, much more.

718
00:48:02,714 --> 00:48:04,423
Where are you goin'?

719
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:35,954
- Hi there, Johnny. I was just-
- Genius!

720
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:38,165
I was just comin' over there.

721
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:41,668
- Where were you? Chicago?
- No, I was on my way over there.

722
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,589
How many times you been knocked out, Terry?

723
00:48:45,757 --> 00:48:49,259
- Knocked out? Uh, two times.
- That's once too often.

724
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:52,763
Your brains must be rattling.
What do you got up there? Chinese bells?

725
00:48:52,931 --> 00:48:55,724
- What's the matter?
- I thought you were gonna keep your eye on that church meeting.

726
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:59,269
I was there. There was nothin' happenin'.

727
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:02,439
"Nothin' happenin'," he says.
Some operator you got yourself there.

728
00:49:02,565 --> 00:49:04,483
One more like him,
we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.

729
00:49:04,609 --> 00:49:07,569
I'm tellin' you, it was a big nothin'.
The priest did all the talkin'.

730
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:09,279
- He did?
- Yeah.

731
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:12,116
Half an hour later, a certain Timothy J. Dugan...

732
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:16,203
had a secret session with the crime commission,
and he done all the talkin'.

733
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,915
Well, Dugan- what does he know?

734
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:22,960
Just 39 pages of our operation, that's all!

735
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,964
- Where'd you get that?
- I got it.

736
00:49:27,132 --> 00:49:30,884
He got it. It's the complete works
of Timothy J. Dugan.

737
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:36,849
- I knew he had the guts, but I never-
- "Guts"?

738
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:39,810
Why, that crummy pigeon!
He oughta have his neck wrung.

739
00:49:39,936 --> 00:49:43,063
That's what we get for getting mixed up
with this punch-drunk brother of yours.

740
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:45,399
He was all right hangin' around for laughs,
but this is business.

741
00:49:45,525 --> 00:49:47,734
- I don't like anyone goofin' off on my business.
- I wasn't goofin', Johnny.

742
00:49:47,861 --> 00:49:49,778
What are you goin' around with his sister for?

743
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:52,156
- I'm not goin'--
- Just shut up!

744
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:57,161
Look, Johnny, it's just that...

745
00:49:57,287 --> 00:50:00,581
the Doyle broad, she's got him so he
doesn't know where his feet is anymore.

746
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:04,668
- It's an unhealthy relationship!
- Definitely.

747
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:07,629
Get rid of her,
unless you're both tired of living.

748
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,631
- <i>You got her address?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

749
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:12,009
Look, we gotta do something to muzzle this Dugan,
or he'll raise...

750
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:14,219
the biggest stink this town has ever seen.

751
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:17,181
We got the best muscle on the waterfront.
The time to use it is now...

752
00:50:17,307 --> 00:50:19,558
pronto, if not sooner.

753
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:22,186
You know where you're goin'?
Back in the hold.

754
00:50:22,312 --> 00:50:25,314
No more cushy job in the loft.
It's down in the hold with the sweat gang...

755
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,482
till you learn your lesson, see?

756
00:50:29,576 --> 00:50:30,694
You!

757
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,656
Let's go.

758
00:50:34,782 --> 00:50:37,034
Wise up!

759
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:21,536
At last, an Irish shipment.

760
00:51:21,663 --> 00:51:25,207
And loaded to the gunnels with fine Irish whiskey.

761
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:29,044
- See, Kayo? The good Lord takes care of his own in time.
- That he does.

762
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,213
Come on there, Kayo! Get it up!

763
00:51:31,339 --> 00:51:33,006
- All right. Take it up.
- <i>Take it up.</i>

764
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:34,883
Take it away.

765
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:38,303
And don't go walkin' off
with any of that!

766
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,223
You know how the boss feels
about individual pilferage!

767
00:51:41,349 --> 00:51:43,183
All right, all right.

768
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:46,395
Now you see the advantage
of a little man in a big coat.

769
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,195
Kayo, let me see you a minute afterwards.

770
00:51:55,321 --> 00:51:58,865
What are you down here for? To see we don't steal
any of Mr. Friendly's precious cargo?

771
00:51:58,992 --> 00:52:00,951
- I want to talk-
- Get away from me, will ya?

772
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:03,495
- All right. Take it up.
- <i>Take it up.</i>

773
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,789
Take it away.

774
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:06,957
Okay.

775
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:20,887
<i>Kayo, you're a walkin' distillery!</i>

776
00:52:29,512 --> 00:52:30,939
Watch it!

777
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:34,359
Get a doctor!

778
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:37,404
He don't need a doctor.
He needs a priest.

779
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:56,048
I came down here to keep a promise.

780
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:59,134
I gave Kayo my word that
if he stood up to the mob...

781
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,179
I'd stand up with him... all the way.

782
00:53:02,305 --> 00:53:05,223
<i>And now Kayo Dugan is dead.</i>

783
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:09,144
<i>He was one of those fellows
who had the gift for standin' up.</i>

784
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:12,731
But this time they fixed him.
Oh, they fixed him for good this time.

785
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:16,151
Unless it was an accident,
like Big Mac says.

786
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:20,572
<i>Some people think the crucifixion
only took place on Calvary.</i>

787
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:23,116
Well, they'd better wise up.

788
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:27,704
Takin' Joey Doyle's life to stop him
from testifying is a crucifixion.

789
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:31,208
And droppin' a sling on Kayo Dugan...

790
00:53:31,334 --> 00:53:34,294
because he was ready to spill his guts tomorrow-

791
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,464
that's a crucifixion!

792
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,050
And every time the mob puts the pressure
on a good man...

793
00:53:40,176 --> 00:53:42,636
<i>tries to stop him from doing
his duty as a citizen...</i>

794
00:53:42,762 --> 00:53:45,305
it's a crucifixion!

795
00:53:45,431 --> 00:53:48,850
And anybody who sits around
and lets it happen...

796
00:53:48,976 --> 00:53:52,229
<i>keeps silent about something
he knows has happened...</i>

797
00:53:52,397 --> 00:53:55,065
shares the guilt of it
just as much as the Roman soldier...

798
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:58,360
who pierced the flesh of our Lord
to see if he was dead.

799
00:54:03,408 --> 00:54:05,283
<i>Go back to your church, Father!</i>

800
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:08,578
Boys, this is my church!

801
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:12,040
And if you don't think Christ is down here on the
waterfront, you've got another guess comin'!

802
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:15,836
<i>Get off the dock, Father!</i>

803
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:18,588
Tillio, don't do that.

804
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,091
- Whose side you on, boy?
- Let him finish.

805
00:54:21,217 --> 00:54:23,051
Every morning...

806
00:54:25,138 --> 00:54:27,264
when the hiring boss blows his whistle...

807
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:31,601
Jesus stands alongside you in the shape-up.

808
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:34,938
He sees why some of you get picked
and some of you get passed over.

809
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:37,566
<i>He sees the family men
worryin' about gettin' the rent...</i>

810
00:54:37,692 --> 00:54:40,235
<i>and gettin' food in the house
for the wife and the kids.</i>

811
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:43,905
He sees you sellin' your souls
to the mob for a day's pay!

812
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:47,617
The next bum that throws somethin'
deals with me!

813
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:49,661
I don't care if he's twice my size!

814
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,913
Now, what does Christ think
of the easy-money boys...

815
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:54,249
who do none of the work
and take all of the gravy?

816
00:54:54,375 --> 00:54:58,128
And how does he feel
about the fellas who wear $150 suits...

817
00:54:58,254 --> 00:55:00,714
<i>and diamond rings on your union dues...</i>

818
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:03,258
and your kickback money?

819
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:04,926
And how does he...

820
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:08,346
who spoke up without fear
against every evil...

821
00:55:08,473 --> 00:55:10,265
feel about your silence?

822
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,100
Shut up about that!

823
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,144
Just watch this.

824
00:55:18,733 --> 00:55:20,484
Did you see that?

825
00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:22,986
You want to know what's wrong
with our waterfront?

826
00:55:23,112 --> 00:55:26,531
It's the love of a lousy buck.
It's makin' love of a buck, the cushy job...

827
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,950
<i>more important than the love of man.</i>

828
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:32,412
<i>It's forgettin' that every fella down here
is your brother in Christ.</i>

829
00:55:32,538 --> 00:55:34,498
<i>But remember: Christ is always with you.</i>

830
00:55:34,624 --> 00:55:36,833
Christ is in the shape-up,
he's in the hatch, he's in the union.

831
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:40,295
He's kneelin' right here beside Dugan...

832
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:43,131
and he's sayin' with all of you...

833
00:55:43,257 --> 00:55:47,594
"If you do it to the least of mine,
you do it to me."

834
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,348
And what they did to Joey and what
they did to Dugan, they're doing to you.

835
00:55:52,642 --> 00:55:55,727
And you, you. All of you!

836
00:55:57,188 --> 00:56:00,774
And only you- only you,
with God's help-

837
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:03,860
have the power to knock 'em out for good.

838
00:56:10,117 --> 00:56:11,785
Okay, Kayo?

839
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:29,177
Amen.

840
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,016
All right, come on! Come on, let's go!

841
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,143
<i>Break it up. Lets go to work.</i>

842
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:54,411
Edie, Joey's jacket.

843
00:56:54,537 --> 00:56:57,080
I'm sure Kayo would wish you
to have it back.

844
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,341
Terry?

845
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,058
Terry?

846
00:58:15,493 --> 00:58:18,036
I brought you Joey's jacket.

847
00:58:18,162 --> 00:58:20,330
Yours is coming apart.

848
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:27,754
Pigeons.

849
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,383
Yeah, they're nervous.

850
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:33,843
There was a hawk around here before.

851
00:58:39,684 --> 00:58:41,101
Edie-

852
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:21,474
Father, I wanna speak to you a minute.

853
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:26,396
Remember what you said about Kayo Dugan...

854
00:59:26,522 --> 00:59:28,440
about keeping your mouth shut
when you know the score?

855
00:59:28,566 --> 00:59:30,984
I don't want to hear your confession.
I'll dig it out for myself...

856
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:33,027
and I'll use it where it'll do
the most good.

857
00:59:33,154 --> 00:59:35,113
Now, you take your turn.
Father Gregory will hear you.

858
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,198
I don't wanna talk-

859
00:59:50,004 --> 00:59:52,088
Wait a second, will ya?
Wait a minute.

860
00:59:52,214 --> 00:59:54,299
I just wanna talk to you one second.

861
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,969
Listen to me. You gotta listen to me.
Wait a minute.

862
00:59:58,095 --> 01:00:01,347
I'm the one that set Joey Doyle up
for the knock-off.

863
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:11,900
Come on. Take a walk with me, kid,
and give it to me straight.

864
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:18,406
There's nothing I haven't heard.
Come on.

865
01:00:31,504 --> 01:00:33,379
It started out as a favor.

866
01:00:33,506 --> 01:00:36,800
"A favor"-- who am I kidding?
It's "do it or else."

867
01:00:36,926 --> 01:00:40,470
But believe me when I tell you I just thought
they was gonna lean on him a little bit.

868
01:00:40,596 --> 01:00:42,555
I never figured they was gonna knock him off.

869
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:45,475
And I tried to tell Edie the other night.
I really tried to.

870
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:48,978
I wanted to tell her. She's the first
nice thing that ever happened to me.

871
01:00:50,606 --> 01:00:52,816
What are you gonna do about it?

872
01:00:52,942 --> 01:00:55,527
- What do you mean? About telling her?
- Yes, about telling her...

873
01:00:55,653 --> 01:00:57,654
the commission, your subpoena.

874
01:00:57,822 --> 01:01:01,449
- I know you got a subpoena.
- Well, I don't know.

875
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:03,827
It's like carrying a monkey
around on your back.

876
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:06,871
It's a question of who rides who.

877
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:09,833
But, you know, if I spill,
my life ain't worth a nickel.

878
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,752
And how much is your soul worth
if you don't?

879
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:16,673
They're askin' me to put the finger
on my own brother.

880
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:20,510
Johnny Friendly used to take me to ball games
when I was a kid.

881
01:01:20,636 --> 01:01:22,846
"Ball games." Don't break my heart.

882
01:01:22,972 --> 01:01:26,724
I wouldn't care if he gave you
a life pass to the Polo Grounds.

883
01:01:26,851 --> 01:01:28,018
So you've got a brother?

884
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:30,854
Let me tell you something:
You've got some other brothers.

885
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:32,814
And they're gettin' the short end...

886
01:01:32,940 --> 01:01:35,733
while your Johnny's getting mustard
on his face at the Polo Grounds.

887
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,819
Ball games! Listen.

888
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:39,988
If I were you, I would walk right-

889
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:45,285
Never mind.
I'm not asking you to do anything.

890
01:01:45,411 --> 01:01:47,704
It's your own conscience
that's got to do the asking.

891
01:01:48,956 --> 01:01:50,832
"Conscience."

892
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:53,418
That stuff- That stuff can drive you nuts.

893
01:01:53,544 --> 01:01:55,879
Good luck.

894
01:01:56,005 --> 01:01:58,423
Hey, is that all you got to say?

895
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:01,593
Come here.

896
01:02:04,555 --> 01:02:06,890
Edie called me this morning.

897
01:02:07,016 --> 01:02:09,142
She's coming here to talk to me.

898
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:12,823
Come on. Why don't you tell her?

899
01:02:15,149 --> 01:02:17,400
No curves.

900
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:22,739
Okay.

901
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:26,326
Thanks.

902
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:06,574
- You?
- Honest to God, Edie-

903
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:19,295
You gotta believe me. I swear to God, Edie.

904
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:15,518
Hey, Terry, guess who's here.

905
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:18,271
That joker from the crime commissioner's office.

906
01:04:40,002 --> 01:04:43,004
Suppose I knew a guy that knocked somebody off.
Think I oughta turn him in?

907
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:46,215
You mean call a cop?
Are you kiddin'?

908
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:48,676
You don't think I oughta turn him in?

909
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:51,387
You was a Golden Warrior once.

910
01:04:51,513 --> 01:04:54,015
That's right.

911
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:56,684
You started the gang.

912
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:21,084
You lookin' for me?

913
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:24,337
No, not exactly.
I was just resting my dogs a minute.

914
01:05:24,463 --> 01:05:28,007
On the next investigation we get into,
I hope it's got buildings with elevators.

915
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,718
So far this one's just been climbing stairs.

916
01:05:32,054 --> 01:05:33,930
What are you climbin' 'em for?

917
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:36,933
Well, it's worth it
if we can tell the waterfront story...

918
01:05:37,059 --> 01:05:39,393
the way the people have a right to hear it.

919
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,437
Don't you think?

920
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:01,958
Say, uh, didn't I see you in the Garden...

921
01:06:02,126 --> 01:06:04,919
three or four years ago
with a fellow named Wilson?

922
01:06:06,755 --> 01:06:07,964
Yeah.

923
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:11,759
Thought you were gonna take him that night.
Man, he really dumped you.

924
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,638
He dumped <i>me,</i> huh?

925
01:06:18,642 --> 01:06:22,979
What would you say if I told you
I held that bum up for half a round?

926
01:06:23,105 --> 01:06:26,274
Yeah. Yeah, I could see he was hurt.

927
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,819
Hey, what do you think I was doin'
with them combinations? Pettin' him?

928
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:32,155
You just couldn't finish him off, huh?

929
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:35,116
Hey, don't monkey around there.

930
01:06:35,242 --> 01:06:38,244
- Why didn't you finish him off?
- What do you talk about, "finish him off"?

931
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,705
I was doin' a favor for a couple of pals of mine.

932
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:42,456
"Favor"?

933
01:06:42,583 --> 01:06:45,710
- That's the way it was.
- <i>That's the way it was.</i>

934
01:06:45,836 --> 01:06:48,629
If I'd have put him down,
I'd have had a title shot.

935
01:06:48,755 --> 01:06:50,840
- I was ready that night.
- You sure looked it.

936
01:06:51,008 --> 01:06:52,925
That's when I figured it was all over.

937
01:06:53,051 --> 01:06:56,012
It was all over, except for the lousy bet.

938
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:58,097
- My own-
- Yeah?

939
01:07:03,312 --> 01:07:05,354
Well, I guess I better get going.

940
01:07:05,522 --> 01:07:07,440
Hit those stairs again.

941
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:13,529
Say, was that a hook or an uppercut
you caught him with that first time?

942
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:17,658
I didn't use no hooks.
I was strictly a short puncher.

943
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:20,828
- Looked like a hook to me.
- I had that bum all figured out.

944
01:07:20,954 --> 01:07:22,997
He had a good left hand.
You know what I mean?

945
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:25,875
So I let him tag me with the left hand
for a couple of rounds.

946
01:07:26,043 --> 01:07:27,877
So just when he starts-
he thinks he's getting cute...

947
01:07:28,045 --> 01:07:31,756
I step inside and jab him with a left,
with a right, with a left.

948
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:35,176
I had him in my arms, and from there on in,
we were just dancin'.

949
01:07:35,302 --> 01:07:38,012
- I see.
- And that's a fact!

950
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:41,599
<i>When those guys wanna win a bet,
there's nothin' they won't stop at.</i>

951
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:49,732
I didn't hear 'em, boss, but I sure seen 'em
nose to nose like a pair of lovers.

952
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,734
The flatfoot was eatin' it up.

953
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,612
Look, so they been seen together
nose to nose, and he smiled at her.

954
01:07:54,738 --> 01:07:56,739
That doesn't mean he's gonna talk.

955
01:07:56,907 --> 01:08:00,201
There is no evidence
until he gives public testimony.

956
01:08:00,327 --> 01:08:02,995
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley.

957
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:05,539
That's what we always kept you around here for.

958
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:07,750
How do we keep him from giving this testimony?

959
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:11,087
Ain't that what you call
the main order of business?

960
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:13,798
He's a good kid. And you know that.

961
01:08:13,924 --> 01:08:17,510
He's a bum. After all the days I gave him in the loft,
he's got no gratitude.

962
01:08:17,636 --> 01:08:20,054
- You shut up!
- Mac...

963
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:23,015
I'm conducting this investigation.

964
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:26,310
Look...

965
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:29,355
this girl and the father,
they got their hooks in the kid so deep...

966
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:31,774
he doesn't even know
which end is up anymore.

967
01:08:31,900 --> 01:08:34,110
I ain't interested in his mental condition.

968
01:08:34,236 --> 01:08:36,862
All I wanna know is,
is he D and D or is he a canary?

969
01:08:40,242 --> 01:08:41,826
I wish I knew.

970
01:08:41,952 --> 01:08:45,371
So do I, Charley. For your sake.

971
01:08:51,962 --> 01:08:53,879
What do you want me to do?

972
01:08:54,006 --> 01:08:56,966
Look, it's simple.
Drive him out to this place we've been usin'.

973
01:08:57,092 --> 01:09:00,303
Try to straighten him out on the way.
If you don't, give him to Gerry G.

974
01:09:00,429 --> 01:09:03,264
Johnny, you can't do that.

975
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:07,560
I mean, maybe the boy is out of line,
but he's just a confused kid.

976
01:09:07,686 --> 01:09:09,645
"Confused kid"?

977
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:15,943
First he crosses me in public
and gets away with it, then the next joker.

978
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:18,195
Pretty soon I'm just another fellow around here!

979
01:09:18,322 --> 01:09:20,740
Johnny, I can't do that.

980
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:28,164
Then don't.

981
01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:40,217
- Who do you like in the third?
- Gotta be New Hope.

982
01:09:40,344 --> 01:09:42,178
Definitely.

983
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:48,142
Johnny...

984
01:09:48,268 --> 01:09:50,227
he's my kid brother.

985
01:09:50,354 --> 01:09:52,396
That's for you to figure out.

986
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:54,815
You can have it your way,
or you can have it his way.

987
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:57,360
But you can't have it both ways.
Am I right, Truck?

988
01:09:57,527 --> 01:09:59,070
Definitely.

989
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:02,990
Okay, on your horse...

990
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:06,952
deep thinker.

991
01:10:37,234 --> 01:10:39,527
- Hi, Charley.
- Hello.

992
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:42,780
I'm glad you stopped by for me.
I been wantin' to talk to you.

993
01:10:42,906 --> 01:10:44,949
- Yeah, sure, kid.
- <i>Where to?</i>

994
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:47,243
Just go to River Street,
and I'll tell you where to stop.

995
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:49,537
- I thought we was goin' to the Garden.
- We are...

996
01:10:49,663 --> 01:10:51,789
but I want to cover a bet
on the way over.

997
01:10:51,915 --> 01:10:54,750
Besides, this'll give us a chance to talk.

998
01:10:54,876 --> 01:10:58,546
Well, nobody ever stopped you from talkin', Charley.

999
01:10:58,672 --> 01:11:01,006
Listen, I, uh- The-

1000
01:11:01,133 --> 01:11:04,301
The grapevine says that you got a subpoena.

1001
01:11:04,428 --> 01:11:05,436
Yeah.

1002
01:11:05,551 --> 01:11:07,721
The guys would know you well enough to know
that you're not a cheese-eater...

1003
01:11:07,848 --> 01:11:10,516
but they think maybe you should not be
on the outside so much.

1004
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:14,770
A little on the inside. Have a few little things
workin' for you down at the docks.

1005
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:19,442
A steady job, a couple extra potatoes-
that's all I want.

1006
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:23,195
Oh, sure, that's great when you're a kid,
but you're gettin' on.

1007
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:25,281
You're pushin' 30, slugger.

1008
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:28,242
It's time to think about gettin' some ambition.

1009
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:33,497
Well, I always figured I'd live
a little bit longer without it.

1010
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:37,877
Maybe.

1011
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:42,965
Look...

1012
01:11:44,301 --> 01:11:46,552
there's a boss loader slot that's open...

1013
01:11:46,678 --> 01:11:49,472
on the new pier we're openin' up.

1014
01:11:49,598 --> 01:11:51,974
You see, now, it pays six cents...

1015
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:55,603
on every hundred pounds that goes in
and every hundred pounds that goes out...

1016
01:11:55,729 --> 01:11:57,646
and you don't have to lift a finger.

1017
01:11:57,814 --> 01:12:00,816
That's two, three,
four hundred dollars a week.

1018
01:12:00,984 --> 01:12:04,570
Four hundred dollars a week
just for the openers.

1019
01:12:04,696 --> 01:12:06,614
I get all that dough for not doin' nothin'?

1020
01:12:06,740 --> 01:12:10,659
You don't do anything,
and you don't say anything.

1021
01:12:10,785 --> 01:12:12,620
You understand?

1022
01:12:17,709 --> 01:12:21,253
There's more to this than I thought, Charley.

1023
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:23,672
I'm tellin' you, there's a lot more.

1024
01:12:24,799 --> 01:12:28,552
You don't mean you're thinkin' of testifyin'
against some people that we might know?

1025
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,846
I don't know, Charley.

1026
01:12:30,972 --> 01:12:33,974
I'm tellin' you I don't know, Charley.
That's what I wanna talk to you about.

1027
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:36,936
Listen, you know how much those piers are worth
that we control through the local?

1028
01:12:37,062 --> 01:12:39,588
- I know that.
- All right. You think Johnny's gonna jeopardize the whole setup...

1029
01:12:39,656 --> 01:12:42,775
- for one rubber-lipped ex-tanker who's walking on his heels?
- Don't say that.

1030
01:12:42,901 --> 01:12:44,652
- What the-
- I coulda been better.

1031
01:12:44,778 --> 01:12:46,862
- That's not the point.
- I coulda been a lot better.

1032
01:12:46,988 --> 01:12:49,156
The point is we don't have much time.

1033
01:12:49,282 --> 01:12:51,367
I'm tellin' you,
I haven't made up my mind yet.

1034
01:12:51,535 --> 01:12:55,538
Well, make up your mind
before we get to 437 River Street!

1035
01:13:02,796 --> 01:13:04,922
Before we get to where, Charley?

1036
01:13:09,553 --> 01:13:11,512
- Before we get to where?
- Listen to me.

1037
01:13:11,638 --> 01:13:15,224
Take the job. Just take it.
No questions. Take it.

1038
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:16,892
Charley.

1039
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:18,894
Terry, take this job, please.

1040
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:20,646
Charley.

1041
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:23,023
Please take it.

1042
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:24,858
Charley.

1043
01:13:33,076 --> 01:13:34,910
Oh, Charley.

1044
01:13:46,298 --> 01:13:48,257
Look, kid, I-

1045
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:51,885
Look, kid, I-

1046
01:13:55,807 --> 01:13:57,766
How much you weigh, slugger?

1047
01:13:59,728 --> 01:14:02,813
<i>When you weighed 168 pounds...</i>

1048
01:14:03,898 --> 01:14:05,774
<i>you were beautiful.</i>

1049
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:09,570
You coulda been another Billy Conn.

1050
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:14,742
And that skunk we got you for a manager...

1051
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:18,037
he brought you along too fast.

1052
01:14:19,998 --> 01:14:22,541
It wasn't him, Charley. It was you.

1053
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:25,878
You remember that night in the Garden
you came down to my dressin' room...

1054
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:28,339
and said, "Kid, this ain't your night.

1055
01:14:28,465 --> 01:14:31,342
We're goin' for the price on Wilson"?

1056
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:33,969
You remember that?

1057
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:36,472
"This ain't your night."

1058
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,892
My night! I coulda taken Wilson apart.

1059
01:14:41,519 --> 01:14:44,647
So what happens?
He gets the title shot outdoors in a ballpark...

1060
01:14:44,773 --> 01:14:47,650
and what do I get?
A one-way ticket to Palookaville.

1061
01:14:47,776 --> 01:14:52,446
You was my brother, Charley.
You shoulda looked out for me a little bit.

1062
01:14:52,572 --> 01:14:54,531
You shoulda taken care of me
just a little bit...

1063
01:14:54,658 --> 01:14:56,659
so I wouldn't have to take dives
for the short-end money.

1064
01:14:56,785 --> 01:14:59,203
I had some bets down for you.
You saw some money.

1065
01:14:59,329 --> 01:15:02,706
You don't understand. I coulda had class.

1066
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:05,042
I coulda been a contender.

1067
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:08,003
I coulda been somebody...

1068
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:10,172
instead of a bum...

1069
01:15:10,298 --> 01:15:12,591
which is what I am, let's face it.

1070
01:15:17,472 --> 01:15:19,598
It was you, Charley.

1071
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:28,774
Okay.

1072
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,526
Okay.

1073
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:34,196
I'll tell him...

1074
01:15:34,322 --> 01:15:36,448
I couldn't find you.

1075
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:38,534
Ten to one he won't believe it.

1076
01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:44,164
Here.

1077
01:15:45,208 --> 01:15:47,042
You take this.

1078
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,045
You're gonna need it.

1079
01:15:51,673 --> 01:15:53,382
You, you pull over.

1080
01:16:02,642 --> 01:16:04,977
Take me to the Garden.

1081
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:30,919
<i>Edie?</i>

1082
01:16:34,299 --> 01:16:36,467
<i>Edie?</i>

1083
01:16:44,726 --> 01:16:46,769
Stay away from me!

1084
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:53,609
<i>Edie?</i>

1085
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:57,404
<i>Come on. Pease open the door. Please.</i>

1086
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,281
Stop it!

1087
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:04,119
I want you to stay away from me!

1088
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:07,372
I know what you want me to do,
but I ain't gonna do it, so forget it!

1089
01:17:07,499 --> 01:17:09,625
I don't want you to do anything.

1090
01:17:09,751 --> 01:17:11,835
You let your conscience
tell you what to do.

1091
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:14,963
Shut up about that conscience.
That's all I been hearin'!

1092
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:18,342
- I never mentioned the word before. You just stay away from me!
- Edie!

1093
01:17:18,468 --> 01:17:20,260
Edie, you love me.

1094
01:17:21,638 --> 01:17:25,015
- I want you-
- I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me!

1095
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:28,060
- I want you to say it to me.
- Stay away from me!

1096
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,079
Terry.

1097
01:17:48,331 --> 01:17:49,873
Terry.

1098
01:18:02,053 --> 01:18:05,055
<i>Hey, Terry!</i>

1099
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:08,350
<i>Hey, Terry, your brother's down here!</i>

1100
01:18:08,476 --> 01:18:10,519
<i>He wants to see ya!</i>

1101
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:15,148
Charley.

1102
01:18:15,275 --> 01:18:17,234
<i>Hey, Terry.</i>

1103
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:23,532
<i>Hey, Terry!</i>

1104
01:18:23,658 --> 01:18:27,077
<i>Your brother's down here.</i>

1105
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:29,872
<i>Come on down here.
He wants to see ya.</i>

1106
01:18:32,667 --> 01:18:35,836
<i>Terry! Come on down!</i>

1107
01:18:38,006 --> 01:18:40,632
- What is it, Terry?
- Charley- I think he's in trouble.

1108
01:18:40,758 --> 01:18:42,634
Be careful!

1109
01:18:48,975 --> 01:18:51,059
Charley.

1110
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:53,186
Terry?

1111
01:18:53,313 --> 01:18:56,064
<i>Come on, Terry.</i>

1112
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:58,609
<i>Your brother's down here!</i>

1113
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:02,404
Do you hear what I hear?

1114
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:06,575
Terry! Terry!

1115
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:12,664
Terry!

1116
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:23,091
That's the same way they called Andy
the night I lost him.

1117
01:19:23,217 --> 01:19:26,094
Edie, be careful! Edie, be careful!

1118
01:19:36,439 --> 01:19:38,231
<i>Terry!</i>

1119
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:42,027
Terry!

1120
01:19:45,406 --> 01:19:48,075
Edie! Watch out for the truck!

1121
01:21:16,914 --> 01:21:18,623
Terry.

1122
01:21:21,669 --> 01:21:23,795
They got Charley.

1123
01:21:23,921 --> 01:21:26,173
Terry, I'm frightened.
Let's get out of here, please.

1124
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:29,760
First Joey, and then Dugan,
and now Charley, and then-

1125
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:32,220
Please, Terry, someplace
where we can live in peace.

1126
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:35,515
I'm gonna take it out of their skulls.

1127
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:40,896
Charley...

1128
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:46,109
I'm gonna take it out of their skulls.

1129
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:48,612
Please, Terry. They'll kill you too.

1130
01:21:48,738 --> 01:21:52,824
Go get the Father.
Tell him to take care of Charley.

1131
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:55,786
And then come on back here
and stay with him till he gets here.

1132
01:21:55,912 --> 01:21:57,788
Terry, please don't do anything.

1133
01:21:57,914 --> 01:22:00,457
Please! Terry!

1134
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:03,585
And for God sakes,
don't leave him alone here long.

1135
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:08,131
- Please, Terry.
- Do what I tell you.

1136
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:09,925
Terry!

1137
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:34,074
Where's John Friendly?

1138
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,243
He's not here now.

1139
01:22:36,369 --> 01:22:38,161
Oh, yeah?

1140
01:23:12,864 --> 01:23:15,615
Gimme a shot.

1141
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:18,118
- Take it easy, Terry.
- Don't give me no advice.

1142
01:23:18,244 --> 01:23:19,995
Give me the shot.

1143
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:27,169
Look, kid, why don't you go home
before Big John gets here?

1144
01:23:27,295 --> 01:23:29,004
Just gimme the whiskey.

1145
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,762
- Go away.
- Stick around, Tillio.

1146
01:23:43,394 --> 01:23:45,020
Go ahead, sit down.

1147
01:23:56,282 --> 01:23:58,867
Get outta that phone booth!

1148
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,558
Stay where you are, Tillio!

1149
01:24:30,483 --> 01:24:33,902
- I want to see ya, Terry.
- I'm right in front of ya.

1150
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:40,242
Now, don't give me a hard time, Terry.

1151
01:24:45,039 --> 01:24:46,957
What do you want?

1152
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:52,087
- Your gun.
- Go and chase yourself.

1153
01:24:52,213 --> 01:24:54,839
- Come on. Give me the gun.
- You go to hell.

1154
01:24:56,926 --> 01:24:59,344
- What did you say?
- Go to hell.

1155
01:25:03,683 --> 01:25:07,394
- Sorry. Let me help you up there.
- Get your hands off of me!

1156
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,397
- <i>Now what am I gonna do?</i>
- <i>You want to be brave?</i>

1157
01:25:10,523 --> 01:25:13,858
Firing lead into another man
isn't being brave!

1158
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:15,694
Why don't you mind your own business?

1159
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:19,322
- Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't being brave!
- It's none of your business!

1160
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:21,908
You want to hurt Johnny Friendly?

1161
01:25:23,434 --> 01:25:24,911
You want to hurt him?
You want to fix him?

1162
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:27,455
Do you? Do you really want to finish him?

1163
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:31,209
- What do you think?
- For what he did to Charley and a dozen other men better than Charley?

1164
01:25:31,335 --> 01:25:33,545
Then don't fight him like a hoodlum
down here in the jungle...

1165
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:35,672
because that's just what he wants!

1166
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:38,508
He'll hit you in the head
and plead self-defense.

1167
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:41,803
You'll fight him in the courtroom tomorrow
with the truth...

1168
01:25:41,929 --> 01:25:43,847
as you know the truth.

1169
01:25:51,981 --> 01:25:54,983
Now, you get rid of that gun,
unless you haven't got the guts.

1170
01:25:55,109 --> 01:25:58,278
And if you haven't,
then you better hold on to it.

1171
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:04,242
Gimme a beer.

1172
01:26:13,294 --> 01:26:16,046
Want a beer? Make it two.

1173
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:58,880
<i>You mean to sit there
and tell me that your local takes in...</i>

1174
01:26:59,006 --> 01:27:02,884
<i>$65,500 every year...</i>

1175
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:05,053
<i>and keeps no financial records?</i>

1176
01:27:05,179 --> 01:27:07,680
- <i>Oh, sure. We got records.</i>
- <i>Well, where are they?</i>

1177
01:27:07,807 --> 01:27:11,643
<i>Well, you see, we was robbed last night,
and we can't find no books.</i>

1178
01:27:11,769 --> 01:27:13,645
<i>You know you're under oath.</i>

1179
01:27:13,771 --> 01:27:15,064
Oh, sure.

1180
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:26,574
Doesn't it seem odd to you
that five different waterfront locals...

1181
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,743
were broken into last night...

1182
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:31,788
and the only item missing from all of them
was the financial records?

1183
01:27:31,914 --> 01:27:34,874
What do you mean, "odd"?
Like I told you, we was robbed.

1184
01:27:41,799 --> 01:27:43,758
That's all for now.

1185
01:27:48,597 --> 01:27:50,765
Call the next witness.

1186
01:27:51,976 --> 01:27:53,935
Before you call the next witness...

1187
01:27:54,061 --> 01:27:57,355
are all the officers of Local 374
present this morning?

1188
01:27:57,481 --> 01:27:59,357
<i>Call the roll.</i>

1189
01:27:59,483 --> 01:28:02,610
Will the following please rise
as the names are called?

1190
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:06,948
Mr. Michael J. Skelly, also known
as Johnny Friendly, president.

1191
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:12,495
<i>Mr. Louis O. Janotta, vice president.</i>

1192
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:16,249
<i>Daniel D. Coogan, financial secretary.</i>

1193
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:19,043
<i>Mr. Vladin Sokolivitch, delegate.</i>

1194
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:21,463
<i>Mr. Tillio A. Rodelli, delegate-</i>

1195
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:23,091
Recordin' secretary.

1196
01:28:26,427 --> 01:28:29,345
- Yeah, recordin' secretary.
- <i>Thank you, gentlemen.</i>

1197
01:28:29,472 --> 01:28:32,307
- Next witness.
- Mr. Malloy.

1198
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:45,195
Raise your right hand.

1199
01:28:45,321 --> 01:28:47,238
- Name, please.
- Terry Malloy.

1200
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:49,782
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1201
01:28:49,909 --> 01:28:51,326
- Right.
- "I do."

1202
01:28:51,494 --> 01:28:53,495
- I do.
- Be seated, please.

1203
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:59,292
Mr. Malloy, is it true that the night
Joey Doyle was found dead...

1204
01:28:59,418 --> 01:29:03,463
you were the last one to see him
before he was pushed from the roof?

1205
01:29:03,589 --> 01:29:06,424
- Yes, that's right.
- And is it true that you went immediately-

1206
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:08,635
Wait. Except for the guys that pushed him off.

1207
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:11,888
<i>And is it true that you went immediately
to the Friendly bar...</i>

1208
01:29:12,014 --> 01:29:15,225
and there expressed your feelings
about the murder to Mr. Johnny Friendly?

1209
01:29:15,351 --> 01:29:17,101
John Friendly. Right.

1210
01:29:17,228 --> 01:29:19,521
<i>And now, Mr. Malloy, can you tell me...</i>

1211
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:22,690
<i>whether Mr. Friendly-
or I should say Mr. Skelly-</i>

1212
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:24,817
<i>said anything to you to indicate his responsibility...</i>

1213
01:29:24,944 --> 01:29:26,861
<i>in getting rid of Joey Doyle?</i>

1214
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:29,322
- <i>Right.</i>
- <i>And would you say, Mr. Malloy...</i>

1215
01:29:29,448 --> 01:29:31,533
<i>that Mr. Friendly made it very clear to you...</i>

1216
01:29:31,659 --> 01:29:34,118
<i>that it was absolutely necessary
that he murder Joey Doyle...</i>

1217
01:29:34,245 --> 01:29:36,454
- <i>in order to maintain his control...</i>
- Turn that thing off.

1218
01:29:36,580 --> 01:29:38,665
<i>of the docks and the waterfront locals?
Is that correct?</i>

1219
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:41,834
Would there be anything else, sir?

1220
01:29:41,961 --> 01:29:44,921
Yes, Sidney. If Mr. Friendly calls, I'm out.

1221
01:29:45,047 --> 01:29:47,840
- Anytime today?
- If he calls ever, I'm out!

1222
01:29:47,967 --> 01:29:49,676
Very well, sir.

1223
01:29:49,802 --> 01:29:51,344
Thank you, Mr. Malloy.

1224
01:29:51,470 --> 01:29:54,639
<i>You've done more than break
the Joey Doyle case.</i>

1225
01:29:57,309 --> 01:30:00,270
You've begun to make it possible
for honest men to work the docks...

1226
01:30:00,396 --> 01:30:02,397
<i>with job security and peace of mind.</i>

1227
01:30:04,775 --> 01:30:07,235
<i>You may step down now.
That's all for now.</i>

1228
01:30:08,571 --> 01:30:10,989
Mr. Michael J. Skelly, please.

1229
01:30:21,959 --> 01:30:24,586
You just dug your own grave.
Go fall in it.

1230
01:30:24,753 --> 01:30:28,464
You're dead on this waterfront
and every waterfront from Boston to New Orleans.

1231
01:30:28,591 --> 01:30:30,842
You don't drive a truck or a cab.

1232
01:30:30,968 --> 01:30:33,761
You don't push a baggage rack.
You don't work no place.

1233
01:30:33,887 --> 01:30:34,972
You're done!

1234
01:30:38,642 --> 01:30:40,518
Get your hands off me!

1235
01:30:41,604 --> 01:30:43,229
Let go!

1236
01:30:52,531 --> 01:30:56,242
Come on, will you quit followin' me?
Why don't you get off my tail?

1237
01:30:56,368 --> 01:30:58,620
- Orders.
- You're hot. You oughta be glad we're followin' you.

1238
01:30:58,746 --> 01:31:00,496
You're makin' me feel like a canary.

1239
01:31:00,623 --> 01:31:02,790
- Well?
- Lay off.

1240
01:31:06,045 --> 01:31:07,795
Hiya, Chickie.

1241
01:31:09,256 --> 01:31:11,215
Who's your friend?

1242
01:31:44,792 --> 01:31:47,502
I made some hot coffee.
I thought you might want some.

1243
01:31:49,630 --> 01:31:51,297
No.

1244
01:31:52,508 --> 01:31:55,510
Well, anyway, it's all over.

1245
01:31:55,636 --> 01:31:58,012
My friends don't wanna talk to me.

1246
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,515
Are you sure they're your friends?

1247
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:05,812
Terry-

1248
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:09,982
I'll see you later.

1249
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:28,251
Hiya, champ. How's the kid?

1250
01:32:48,647 --> 01:32:50,898
A pigeon for a pigeon!

1251
01:33:20,721 --> 01:33:22,430
Terry?

1252
01:33:38,113 --> 01:33:39,739
The kid.

1253
01:33:42,618 --> 01:33:44,702
Tommy?

1254
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:48,581
What'd he have to do that for?

1255
01:33:50,375 --> 01:33:52,293
Every one of 'em.

1256
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:56,798
Terry, there's no place that's safe
for you now on the waterfront.

1257
01:33:57,883 --> 01:34:01,385
Maybe inland, out west someplace.

1258
01:34:01,512 --> 01:34:03,721
<i>A farm.</i>

1259
01:34:03,847 --> 01:34:06,933
- "A farm"?
- <i>You could do lots of things...</i>

1260
01:34:07,059 --> 01:34:09,602
<i>anything, as long as you're away
from Johnny Friendly.</i>

1261
01:34:09,728 --> 01:34:12,855
<i>And even the longshoremen-
You try to help them, and they just turn their backs...</i>

1262
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:15,066
<i>and stick to their stupid D and D.</i>

1263
01:34:15,192 --> 01:34:19,028
<i>Are they taking chances for you?
Why should you?</i>

1264
01:34:19,154 --> 01:34:21,614
<i>You're not even listening to me, are you?</i>

1265
01:34:29,414 --> 01:34:31,290
You're going down there.

1266
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:35,795
Just because John Friendly warned you not to,
you're going down there.

1267
01:34:35,921 --> 01:34:39,757
You think you've got to prove something to them,
that you're not afraid of them or something.

1268
01:34:39,883 --> 01:34:41,676
Well, go ahead! Get it over with!

1269
01:34:41,802 --> 01:34:43,719
Go down to the shape-up
and get yourself killed!

1270
01:34:43,846 --> 01:34:46,889
You stupid, pigheaded-
What are you trying to prove?

1271
01:34:50,435 --> 01:34:52,687
They always said I was a bum.

1272
01:34:54,273 --> 01:34:56,440
Well, I ain't a bum, Edie.

1273
01:34:57,526 --> 01:35:00,528
Don't worry. I'm not gonna hurt nobody.

1274
01:35:00,654 --> 01:35:03,281
I'm just gonna go down there...

1275
01:35:03,407 --> 01:35:05,366
and get my rights.

1276
01:35:18,297 --> 01:35:20,006
Okay.

1277
01:35:50,078 --> 01:35:54,165
All right! Everybody works today!

1278
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:14,852
Lofgang...

1279
01:36:14,978 --> 01:36:16,854
Hendricks...

1280
01:36:16,980 --> 01:36:19,523
Prochowski...

1281
01:36:19,650 --> 01:36:21,651
Horton...

1282
01:36:21,777 --> 01:36:25,613
<i>Dalton, Flaherty, Kaufman-</i>

1283
01:36:27,574 --> 01:36:31,827
- What do you think, boys?
- That ain't such a bad picture of you, boss.

1284
01:36:31,954 --> 01:36:35,498
Stop breathin' that clam sauce on me.
What's doin'?

1285
01:36:35,624 --> 01:36:39,794
I wish you'd let me go to work on that cheese-eater.
I'd top the bum off lovely.

1286
01:36:39,962 --> 01:36:42,296
Wait till we get off this front page.

1287
01:36:42,464 --> 01:36:44,298
Then he's mine.

1288
01:36:44,424 --> 01:36:46,384
I want him.

1289
01:36:46,510 --> 01:36:49,053
You hear that? He's mine.

1290
01:36:54,643 --> 01:36:57,645
Where're them cops of yours, stoolie?
You're gonna need 'em.

1291
01:37:03,568 --> 01:37:06,153
You're still short in the hatch, Mac.

1292
01:37:07,990 --> 01:37:11,075
Hey, Speck, bring me the first man you see.

1293
01:37:12,411 --> 01:37:13,828
Hey, you.

1294
01:37:14,913 --> 01:37:16,580
Hey, you.

1295
01:37:17,874 --> 01:37:19,834
Here's your man, Mac.

1296
01:37:22,671 --> 01:37:25,715
You want more of the same?
Come back tomorrow.

1297
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:30,386
All right. That's it.

1298
01:37:52,743 --> 01:37:55,202
I hope that bum comes down here.

1299
01:37:55,328 --> 01:37:58,456
I love if he comes down here.

1300
01:37:58,582 --> 01:38:02,752
Did you ever hear of the Sullivan law?
They'll be down on us for the slightest infraction- anything!

1301
01:38:02,878 --> 01:38:05,171
I'm gonna be indicted any minute!

1302
01:38:05,297 --> 01:38:07,840
Come on, now. Gimme, gimme, gimme!

1303
01:38:09,551 --> 01:38:12,136
Will you get it through your heads?

1304
01:38:12,262 --> 01:38:14,889
They're dustin' off a hot seat for me!

1305
01:38:17,476 --> 01:38:20,019
We're a law-abidin' union.

1306
01:38:20,145 --> 01:38:21,854
<i>Understand?</i>

1307
01:38:32,199 --> 01:38:34,116
He'll kill him.

1308
01:38:58,183 --> 01:39:00,267
Hey, Friendly!

1309
01:39:00,393 --> 01:39:03,938
<i>John Friendly, come outta there!</i>

1310
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,148
<i>Friendly!</i>

1311
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:10,069
Come on outta there!

1312
01:39:10,195 --> 01:39:12,113
You wanna know the trouble with you?

1313
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:15,449
You think it makes you a big man
if you give the answers.

1314
01:39:15,617 --> 01:39:18,369
At the right time, I'll catch up with you.
Be thinkin' about that.

1315
01:39:18,495 --> 01:39:22,289
- Now, go on, beat it. Don't push your luck.
- Wait a minute, you!

1316
01:39:22,415 --> 01:39:25,334
You take them heaters away from you,
and you're nothin'! You know that?

1317
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:27,086
You'll talk yourself in the river!

1318
01:39:27,212 --> 01:39:29,713
You take the good goods away,
and the kickbacks...

1319
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:33,634
and the shake-down cabbage,
and them pistoleros, and you're nothin'!

1320
01:39:33,802 --> 01:39:37,263
Your guts is all in your wallet
and your trigger finger, you know that?

1321
01:39:37,389 --> 01:39:40,349
- You ratted on us, Terry!
- From where you stand, maybe...

1322
01:39:40,475 --> 01:39:42,643
but I'm standin' over here now!

1323
01:39:42,769 --> 01:39:46,689
- I was rattin' on myself all them years- I didn't even know it.
- Come on!

1324
01:39:46,815 --> 01:39:48,691
You give it to Joey,
you give it to Dugan...

1325
01:39:48,817 --> 01:39:50,943
you give it to Charley,
who was one of your own.

1326
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:54,488
- You think you're God Almighty, but you know what you are?
- Come on.

1327
01:39:54,614 --> 01:39:56,657
You're a cheap, lousy...

1328
01:39:56,825 --> 01:39:58,909
dirty, stinkin' mug...

1329
01:39:59,035 --> 01:40:01,495
and I'm glad what I done to you!

1330
01:40:01,621 --> 01:40:05,374
You hear that? I'm glad what I done!

1331
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:10,421
- And I'm gonna keep on doin' it till I get-
- Come on! Come on!

1332
01:40:19,806 --> 01:40:21,974
Come on!

1333
01:40:38,867 --> 01:40:40,826
That boy fights like he used to.

1334
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:46,624
Truck!

1335
01:40:52,005 --> 01:40:54,757
- They'll kill him.
- It's a massacre.

1336
01:40:54,883 --> 01:40:56,842
He's one of theirs anyway.

1337
01:40:58,511 --> 01:41:01,055
Get him! Get him!

1338
01:41:01,181 --> 01:41:03,307
What are we waitin' for? Let's go.

1339
01:41:05,268 --> 01:41:06,478
<i>That's enough.</i>

1340
01:41:07,604 --> 01:41:09,688
<i>Just let him lay there.</i>

1341
01:41:32,254 --> 01:41:33,879
What happened?

1342
01:41:35,006 --> 01:41:37,299
What happened?

1343
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:39,385
Jimmy, what happened?

1344
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:48,227
Where ya goin'?

1345
01:41:48,353 --> 01:41:49,812
Let me by.

1346
01:42:04,327 --> 01:42:06,620
You want him?

1347
01:42:08,248 --> 01:42:10,457
You can have him!

1348
01:42:16,631 --> 01:42:18,757
The little rat's yours.

1349
01:42:30,395 --> 01:42:33,272
- Get some fresh water!
- Terry?

1350
01:42:36,318 --> 01:42:37,651
Terry.

1351
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:39,445
Terry, listen.

1352
01:42:39,571 --> 01:42:41,030
Who's in charge here?

1353
01:42:41,156 --> 01:42:43,449
Yours truly's in charge here. Look out.

1354
01:42:43,575 --> 01:42:46,160
We gotta get this ship outta here.
It's costing us money.

1355
01:42:46,286 --> 01:42:47,378
Blow your whistle.

1356
01:42:48,204 --> 01:42:50,664
All right, you guys! Get to work!

1357
01:42:50,832 --> 01:42:52,499
Come on!

1358
01:42:52,625 --> 01:42:54,668
- What goes?
- I'll have 'em workin' in two minutes.

1359
01:42:54,836 --> 01:42:57,838
- Come on, you guys! Get goin'!
- He'd better get these men to work.

1360
01:42:57,964 --> 01:42:59,548
Go on down!

1361
01:43:00,842 --> 01:43:03,469
Come on, you guys. On the double.
Get to work. You heard me.

1362
01:43:03,595 --> 01:43:07,264
Come on. Get in there.
Get in there!

1363
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:10,476
- How about Terry?
- He don't work, we don't work!

1364
01:43:10,602 --> 01:43:13,228
Work? He can't even walk!

1365
01:43:13,355 --> 01:43:16,940
You wanna know who works?
The ones I pick to work! Now, get goin'.

1366
01:43:17,067 --> 01:43:21,362
Come on. All of you, get in there.
Come on, get to work. All of you.

1367
01:43:21,488 --> 01:43:24,156
Come on, get up here!
Come on, Pop. On the double.

1368
01:43:24,282 --> 01:43:25,532
You work today.

1369
01:43:25,658 --> 01:43:28,202
All my life ya pushed me around.

1370
01:43:28,328 --> 01:43:29,662
Oh, come on!

1371
01:43:38,713 --> 01:43:42,174
How do ya like it?
How do ya like it?

1372
01:43:42,300 --> 01:43:45,344
Come on! You walk in, and we'll-

1373
01:43:53,103 --> 01:43:54,978
If Terry walks in, we walk in with him.

1374
01:43:55,105 --> 01:43:57,481
- They're waitin' for him to walk in!
- Jimmy-

1375
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:03,362
Water.

1376
01:44:07,784 --> 01:44:11,453
Did you hear that, Terry? Terry?

1377
01:44:11,579 --> 01:44:14,415
- Terry, did you hear that?
- Yeah.

1378
01:44:14,541 --> 01:44:17,292
You lost the battle, but...

1379
01:44:17,419 --> 01:44:19,711
you have a chance to win the war.

1380
01:44:21,297 --> 01:44:23,507
- What do I have to do?
- Walk.

1381
01:44:23,633 --> 01:44:26,135
- Father-
- Can you walk?

1382
01:44:26,261 --> 01:44:28,220
- Walk?
- Yes, walk.

1383
01:44:29,431 --> 01:44:31,014
To the pier, I mean.

1384
01:44:31,141 --> 01:44:33,684
- And we'll walk in with you.
- So the shippers can see...

1385
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:36,270
<i>we'll take no more orders from Johnny Friendly.</i>

1386
01:44:36,438 --> 01:44:40,107
<i>Then it'll give us back our union,
so we can run it on the up-and-up.</i>

1387
01:44:41,526 --> 01:44:44,862
Johnny Friendly's layin' odds
that you won't get up.

1388
01:44:48,116 --> 01:44:51,577
<i>What are you standin' around for?
Come on and help me!</i>

1389
01:44:51,703 --> 01:44:54,413
Come on, you guys!

1390
01:44:55,457 --> 01:44:57,708
Put me on my feet.

1391
01:44:57,834 --> 01:44:59,501
Come on.

1392
01:45:09,637 --> 01:45:11,805
Take your hands off.
How you doin', pal?

1393
01:45:13,892 --> 01:45:15,809
Am I on my feet?

1394
01:45:17,103 --> 01:45:19,021
You're on your feet.

1395
01:45:21,399 --> 01:45:24,485
- I don't think I'm gonna make it.
- Terry?

1396
01:45:24,652 --> 01:45:26,195
You can.

1397
01:45:29,491 --> 01:45:32,075
Just finish what you started.

1398
01:45:32,202 --> 01:45:33,952
You can.

1399
01:45:35,413 --> 01:45:37,331
Okay.

1400
01:45:37,457 --> 01:45:39,249
Okay.

1401
01:45:40,793 --> 01:45:42,586
Gimme my hook.

1402
01:45:42,712 --> 01:45:44,796
- What are you trying to do?
- He's got to.

1403
01:45:44,923 --> 01:45:46,840
Take your hands off. Keep 'em off.

1404
01:45:52,347 --> 01:45:54,139
Leave him alone.

1405
01:45:55,892 --> 01:45:57,684
Leave him alone!

1406
01:46:56,786 --> 01:46:59,162
All right, let's go to work!

1407
01:47:04,168 --> 01:47:05,961
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1408
01:47:06,087 --> 01:47:08,755
Come back here!

1409
01:47:08,923 --> 01:47:11,592
Come on, you guys!

1410
01:47:11,718 --> 01:47:13,427
Where you guys goin'?

1411
01:47:13,553 --> 01:47:16,388
<i>Wait a minute! I'll remember this!</i>

1412
01:47:16,514 --> 01:47:19,975
I'll remember every one of ya!

1413
01:47:20,101 --> 01:47:23,228
I'll be back!
Don't you forget that!

1414
01:47:23,354 --> 01:47:25,105
<i>I'll be back!</i>
