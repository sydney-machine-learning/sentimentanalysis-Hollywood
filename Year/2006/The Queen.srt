1
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,440
After weeks of campaigning on the road...

2
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,080
Tony Blair and his family, 
finally strolled the few hundred yards 

3
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,120
to the polling station, 
this election day morning.

4
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,600
Amongst the Labour faithful
up and down the country...

5
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,560
there is an enormous sense
of pride in Mr. Blair's achievements.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,280
And the confidence
that he is about to become

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,520
the youngest Prime Minister
this century.

8
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,240
Have you voted yet,
Mr. Crawford?

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes, Ma'am...

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,200
I was there when they opened,
first in line, at 7 o'clock...

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,520
I don't mind telling you...
It wasn't for Mr. Blair.

12
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,320
- Your not a moderniser then?
- Certainly not...

13
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,560
We're in danger of losing too much,
that is good about this country, as it is.

14
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,200
There is a growing sense
of excitement...

15
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,600
I envy you,
being able to vote.

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,360
Not the actually
ticking of the box, although...

17
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,120
it would be nice
to experience that once.

18
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,920
But the sheer joy of being partial.

19
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes...

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,880
Of course one forgets that as Sovereign,
you're not entitled to vote.

21
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,040
No...

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,400
Still, you won't catch me
feeling sorry for you.

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,520
You might not
be allowed to vote, Ma'am...

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,480
but it is your government.

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,120
Yes...

26
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,880
I suppose that is some consolation.

27
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,240
Good morning.

28
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,440
- Shall I draw the curtains.
- Yes...

29
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,720
- So, did you stay up all night?
- Yes, Ma'am.

30
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,040
- And was it as expected?
- Yes, Ma'am.

31
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,400
- Mr. Blair.
- By a landslide.

32
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,800
Oh, I see...

33
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,640
They've stopped the traffic, completely...

34
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,520
For Tony Blair's first
day of power, in London.

35
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,160
You got the ceremonial
with tourists, the official...

36
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,800
and you got
a lovely summer's day...

37
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,400
Tony Blair waving to the crowds,
people waving to them there...

38
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,960
I guess most of them
do know it's the...

39
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,840
the Prime Minister waiting...
Lining in the streets there.

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,160
The Prime Minister
is on his way, Ma'am.

41
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,320
To be, Robin..
The Prime Minister to be...

42
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,640
I haven't asked him yet.

43
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,560
He's a hard one to read,
isn't he?

44
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,360
Yes... On the one hand his
background is quite establishment...

45
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,400
father a conservative,
educated at Fettis. Where he was

46
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,280
tutored by the same
man as the Prince of Wales.

47
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,080
Well, we'll try not
to hold that against him.

48
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,480
On the other, his manifesto promises
the most radical modernisation...

49
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,480
and shake up of the
constitution in 300 years.

50
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,800
Oh, you mean he is
going to try and modernise us?

51
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,280
I wouldn't let it past him...

52
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,640
he's married to a woman with known
anti-monarchist sympathies...

53
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,440
you may remember her curtsy,
the first time you met.

54
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,280
It could best
be described as.. shallow.

55
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,880
I don't measure the depth of a
curtsy, Robin. I leave that to my sister.

56
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,280
The atmosphere at Downing Street
is expected to very informal...

57
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,360
Everyone on first name terms...

58
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,240
at the Prime Minister's insistence.

59
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,240
- What, as in call me Tony?
- Yes, Ma'am.

60
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,120
Oh, I don't like that.

61
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,800
Could we send him a protocol sheet?

62
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,440
Funny, I'm actually rather nervous.

63
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,200
Why? You've met her
often enough before.

64
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,880
I know, but..
never one to one...

65
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,040
and never as Prime Minister.

66
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,520
Well, just remember..  you're a man
that's just been elected by
the whole nation.

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,280
But she's still...

68
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,960
you know.. The Queen.

69
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,880
When we reach the
audience room...

70
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,320
I will knock.
We will not wait to be called..
we shall go straight inside.

71
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,440
Standing by the door,
we bow.. from the neck...

72
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,200
I will introduce you...

73
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,400
The Queen will extend her hand..
you go to her...

74
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,520
bow again..
then shake her hand.

75
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,400
A couple of other things...

76
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,240
It's Ma'am as in ham...

77
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,520
not mam as in farm.

78
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,800
And when you're in the presence...

79
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,040
at no point must you
show your back.

80
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,320
- The presence?
- Yes, sir...

81
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,760
That's what it is called, when you're
in Her Majesty's company.

82
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,200
Would you like
to sit down, Mrs. Blair?

83
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,080
How nice to see you
again, Mr. Blair.

84
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,280
And congratulations.

85
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,360
The children must be very proud?

86
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,800
- I hope so.
- You have three, haven't you?

87
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,360
- That's right.
- Oh, how lovely.

88
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,040
Such a blessing.. children.

89
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,240
Please, do sit down.

90
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,560
Thank you.

91
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,680
Have they shown you how to
start a nuclear war, yet?

92
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
Ah, no...

93
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,200
Oh, first thing we do.
Apparently...

94
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,800
Then we take away your passport,
and spend the rest of the time
sending you around the world.

95
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
You obviously know my job,
better than I do...

96
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,320
Well you are my 10th
Prime Minister, Mr. Blair.

97
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,040
My first, of course,
was Winston Churchill

98
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,240
he sat in your chair...
in a front coat...

99
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,200
and top hat.

100
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,360
He was kind enough to give,
a shy young girl like me,
quite an education.

101
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,440
I can imagine...

102
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,720
With time, one has hopefully added
experience to that education.
And a little wisdom...

103
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,400
better enabling us to execute
our constitutional responsibility.

104
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,080
To advise, guide, and warn
the government of the day.

105
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,640
Advise which I...

106
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,560
look forward to receiving.

107
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,040
Yes, we'll save that for
our weekly meetings.

108
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,480
If there's nothing else, I believe we
have some business to attend to.

109
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,880
Of course...

110
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,920
Your Majesty, my party has
won the election...

111
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,240
so I come now to ask your
permission to form a govern...

112
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,520
No, Mr. Blair.
Mr. Blair, I ask the question.

113
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
The duty falls upon me
as your Sovereign

114
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,360
to invite you
to become Prime Minister...

115
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,880
and to form a
government in my name.

116
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,440
And if you agree,
the custom is to say yes...

117
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,920
Yes...

118
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,320
Mrs. Blair...
Lovely to see you again.

119
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,600
And congratulations.
You must be very proud.

120
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,560
- Yes...
- And exhausted, I imagine...

121
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,280
Where will you be spending
the summer?

122
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,040
- France.
- Oh, lovely.

123
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:46,400
- You'll be at Balmoral, right?
- Yes, I can't wait.
It's a wonderful place.

124
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
You know my great great
grandmother Victoria said of it...

125
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,400
in Balmoral all seems to breed...

126
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,280
freedom and peace and make one
forget the world and its sad turmoils.

127
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,080
Oh, excuse me.

128
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,600
Oh, yes of course...

129
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,200
I'm so sorry, we're going to
have to leave it there.

130
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,600
- Not to short was it?
15 minutes...

131
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,320
One doesn't want to be rude.

132
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
- No, no.

133
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,480
- Thank you very much
for coming, now fuck off!

134
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,160
- I know,
what was all that about?

135
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,160
God knows... Diana.
Whatever it is it will be
something to do with Diana.

136
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,120
Princess Diana embroiled
in more controversy

137
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,600
as she pulls out
of a meeting with MP's...

138
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,280
Princess Diana moved today
to patch up

139
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,600
her relations with
the former royal nanny...

140
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,760
Princess Diana flew to Milan today
for the memorial service

141
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,920
for the murdered
Italian fashion designer...

142
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,320
Gianni Versace.

143
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,560
Where tonight, another royal
controversy sparkles...

144
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,040
after finding herself embroiled
in her second controversy this week...

145
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,640
I am not a political figure...

146
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,120
Princess Diana sailed out
into the Mediterranean...

147
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,600
in one of Mr. Mohamed
al-Fayed's yachts today...

148
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,480
with his son.

149
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,080
A quarter of a
million pounds, for photographs

150
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,880
which appear
to show the couple embracing...

151
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,960
Once again,
her judgement's under scrutiny...

152
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,720
Robin Janvrin.

153
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,000
What?

154
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,560
I want everyone in, ASAP.

155
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,880
Ma'am?

156
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,680
Ma'am?

157
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,240
Ma'am, Mr. Janvrin
is here to see you.

158
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,440
What?

159
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,680
Good evening, Ma'am.

160
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,680
I'm sorry to disturb. But I just
had a call from our Embassy in Paris.

161
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,520
- It's The Princess of Wales.
- Why?

162
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,080
What's she done now?

163
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,480
I see, em...

164
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,400
Who are we speaking to then?

165
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,720
Right, well keep me updated.

166
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,520
It's Diana, she's been in
a car accident in Paris.

167
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,880
Is it serious?

168
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,480
Apparently.. Dodi Fayed is dead.

169
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,840
Let's just recap on the
details of those injuries, Maxine.

170
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,440
Yes Nick, what they're saying is...

171
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,960
that the Princess is in the intensive
care unit of a south-east Paris hospital.

172
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,600
She has a concussion,
a broken arm, and...

173
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,560
What was she doing in Paris? I thought
she was supposed to be in London.

174
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,320
Oh, you know what she's like.

175
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,040
Charles, isn't this awful?

176
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,480
What are you
going to do about the boys?

177
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,520
Let them sleep until we know more.

178
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,760
Yes, that's sensible.

179
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,040
I should go to Paris. I told
my people to start organising a jet.

180
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,880
- What, a private one?
- Yes...

181
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,720
Isn't that precisely the sort of
extravagance they always attack us for?

182
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,480
How else am I supposed to
get to Paris at this time of night?

183
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,240
The airport at Aberdeen
will be closed.

184
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,160
Charles...

185
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:29,200
Use the royal flight. They keep one
plane on permanent standby...

186
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,720
in case I should kick the bucket.

187
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,840
No mummy! That's out of the question.
This isn't a matter of state.

188
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,480
- What are you talking about?
- Diana is no longer a member
of the royal family.

189
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,320
She's not a HRH.
This is a private matter.

190
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,880
She's mother to your grandchildren.

191
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,280
- What is happening now?
- I don't know... I can't hear...

192
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,520
everyone's shouting.

193
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,640
Thank's for coming in.

194
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,240
The Ambassador,
from Paris.

195
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,280
Good evening, sir.

196
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,280
Yes?

197
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,280
I have just spoken to
our Ambassador in Paris, Ma'am...

198
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,160
I'm afraid it's not good news...

199
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,560
No!

200
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,760
No, no, no...

201
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,920
Diana, Princess of Wales,
has died, after a car crash in Paris.

202
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,600
The french government
announced her death

203
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,280
just before
5 o'clock this morning.

204
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What have I got on this week?

205
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,840
You're writing your maiden
conference speeches, Prime Minister.

206
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,480
Well, let's cancel everything else.

207
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,000
This is going to be massive...

208
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,560
I'd better make a statement
in the morning.

209
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,400
Well, you'll be pleased to know I've
already started coming up with ideas.

210
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:11,160
God, she's only been dead an hour...

211
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,240
Well, would you prefer
I didn't do my job?

212
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,320
They're going go to
go back to sleep.

213
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,360
Try anyway...

214
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,480
My private secretary's office
have found a travel agency

215
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,080
open in New York
that will...

216
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,640
sell me a flight to Paris, with
an hours stop over in Manchester.

217
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,440
Perhaps now you might
like to consider whether it's

218
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,760
still an extravagance
to bring back the mother...

219
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,040
of the future King of England...

220
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,080
In one of our planes?

221
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,120
Alright...

222
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,160
of course.

223
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,560
John, I don't want the boys
to see the news and get upset...

224
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,840
first thing in the morning,
I want the radio taken

225
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,120
out of the bedroom, and the
television taken out of the nursery.

226
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:41,920
Yes, Ma'am.

227
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,760
Well, well, well...

228
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Yes.

229
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,920
Are you alright?

230
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,480
Your sister called.

231
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,040
From Tuscany.

232
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,280
Well, I hope you told her to
come back, cut her holiday short.

233
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,040
I did.

234
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:08,760
- I can't imagine she was pleased...
- That's putting it mildly.

235
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,960
- What did she say?
- Something about Diana managing...

236
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,280
to be even more annoying
dead than alive...

237
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,560
Just make sure you never let
the boys hear you talk like that.

238
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,920
Of course...

239
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,600
Something to help you go down.

240
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,280
No, I think I'll write
my diary a little longer.

241
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,640
Fine.

242
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,120
I'm going to bed.

243
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,040
We've heard nothing official from
the Palace yet, we still don't know

244
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,880
when we're gonna get any further
statements from inside the Palace..

245
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,040
or of course when the royal
family are due back.

246
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,520
That's how she will remain,
in our minds, our hearts...

247
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,840
forever.

248
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,240
OK?
Got it!

249
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,240
Where will you do it?

250
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,960
We'll do it at the church.
On the way in.

251
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,720
Alright, I'll organise it.

252
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,000
Hang on...
I wanna watch this.

253
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,560
This is not the time for
incriminations, but for sadness...

254
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
however I would say
that I always believed

255
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,600
the press would
kill her in the end...

256
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,800
but not even I
could imagine they'll take

257
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,040
such a direct hand in her death...

258
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,200
as seems to be the case.

259
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,600
It would appear that every
proprieter and editor...

260
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,040
of every publication
that has payed for intrusive

261
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,480
and exploitative
photographs of her...

262
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,240
has blood on his hands today.

263
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,440
Not the press, mate.
You got the wrong villain.

264
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,320
Tony...

265
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,800
got to go...

266
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,240
You about to speak
to The Queen?

267
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,520
- Yeah...
- Ask her if she greased the breaks.

268
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,400
Now, now...

269
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,560
Hello?

270
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,520
Right, okay...

271
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,640
Is The Prince of Wales
with the boys?

272
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,720
Yes, Ma'am

273
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,760
- And he's going to Paris?
- Yes...

274
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,440
I'm sorry to disturb, Ma'am...
Ma'am...

275
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,560
but I have the Prime Minister for you,
from his constituency.

276
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,280
Lucky you..

277
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,160
Thank you, Robin.
I'll take it in the study.

278
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,000
- Good morning, Your Majesty.
- Prime Minister.

279
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,960
May I say right away,
how very sorry I am...

280
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,480
and that the thoughts
and prayers of my family

281
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,160
are with you
at this terrible time.

282
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,880
And with the Princes,
in particular.

283
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,560
Thank you.

284
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,320
Is it your intention to make
some kind of appearance?

285
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,800
Or statement?

286
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,440
No, no!
Certainly not.

287
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,360
No member of the royal family
will speak publicly about this.

288
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,800
This is a private matter.

289
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,400
We would all appreciate it,
if it could be respected as such.

290
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,240
I see.

291
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,760
I don't suppose anyone has had
time to think about the funeral, yet?

292
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,760
We've spoken with the
Spencer family, and it is their wish...

293
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,640
it is their expressed wish,
that this should be a private funeral.

294
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,640
with a memorial service to follow,
in a month or so.

295
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,760
Right...

296
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,960
And given that Diana was
no longer a member of the royal family...

297
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,560
we have no other choice,
but to respect their wishes.

298
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,160
I see...

299
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:03,640
you don't feel that in view
of her high profile popularity...

300
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,800
it might be an idea to pay
tribute to her life and achievements?

301
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,920
Or even just to her as a mother?

302
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,360
Well, as I said,
it's her family's wish...

303
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,640
And the public, Ma'am?
The British people...

304
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,760
you don't think a private funeral
might be denying them a chance...

305
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,480
A chance to what?

306
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,520
To share in the grief.

307
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,440
This is a family funeral, Mr. Blair,
not a fairground attraction.

308
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,120
I think The Princess has
already paid a high enough price...

309
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,000
for exposure to the press...

310
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,840
don't you?

311
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,680
Now, if there's nothing else,
I must get on.

312
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,400
The children have to be looked after.

313
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,440
Of course...
well, goodbye Your Majes...

314
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,920
Her instinct is to do nothing.

315
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,280
Say nothing.. and
give her a private funeral.

316
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,640
Are you surprised?

317
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,120
She hated her guts.

318
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,680
Well, I think it's a mistake...

319
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,880
They screwed up her life, let's
hope they don't screw up her death.

320
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,280
Where can I find a black tie?

321
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,440
Oh, the chaplain called.

322
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,000
He wanted to know,
whether we should make any

323
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,520
changes in the service..
any...

324
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,960
special mention of Diana.

325
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,680
What did you say?

326
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,440
Well, I told him
not to change a thing.

327
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,920
Quite right...

328
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,760
I think the less attention one
draws to it, the better.

329
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,080
- For the boys.
- Yes...

330
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,800
But I think maybe we should find
some company for them...

331
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,760
Some young people.

332
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,080
I'll take them for a long walk,
this afternoon.. up Craggie Head.

333
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,160
Yes, but no guns Phillip..
it is Sunday.

334
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,880
And we're going... in fact...
I believe...

335
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,680
to Sedgefield, the
Prime Minister's constituency...

336
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,120
where he is about
to make a statement...

337
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,680
yes the Prime Minister coming
now, with his wife Cherie...

338
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,560
He's on. Alastair, he's on.
Come on!

339
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,400
...as her own life was often,
sadly touched by tradegy...

340
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,240
she touched the lives,
of so many others in...

341
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,720
in Britain, throughout the world...

342
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,960
with joy...

343
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,960
and with comfort.

344
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,040
The people, everywhere...

345
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,520
not just here in Britain,
everywhere...

346
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,840
they kept faith,
with Princess Diana.

347
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,240
They liked her, they loved her...

348
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,040
they regarded her,
as one of the people...

349
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,400
she was the people's Princess.

350
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,440
And that's how she will stay...

351
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,040
how she will remain.

352
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,480
In our hearts...

353
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,360
and in our memories...

354
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,640
forever.

355
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,720
A little over the top,
don't you think?

356
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,000
The people of Britain, he said...

357
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,120
kept faith with Princess Diana...

358
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,360
they loved her..
she was the people's Princess.

359
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,800
- Did we remember the Royal Standard?
- Yes, Sir.

360
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,320
- And flowers?
- Yes, Sir.

361
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,440
Good, 'cause if we leave it
to the rural undertakers...

362
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,560
they'll bring her
back in a wooden crypt.

363
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,360
Hello?

364
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,680
This is Lord Airlie, may I speak
with the Prime Minister, please?

365
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,280
One moment, please.

366
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,760
Lord Airlie..
The Lord Chamberlain

367
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,240
in charge of the funeral..
you're meeting him at the airport.

368
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,040
Lord Airlie.

369
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,720
Good afternoon, Prime Minister,
it's my job to organise

370
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,920
all the ceremonial events.

371
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,160
There is simply no precedent
for the funeral of an ex-HRH.

372
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,480
Perhaps we shall plan
for any contingency.

373
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,280
Yes, I propose a meeting
at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning

374
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,040
at Buckingham Palace...

375
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,000
officals from all three Palaces,
representatives from the

376
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,880
Spencer family,
the emergency services...

377
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,080
would you send some of your people?

378
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,520
Absolutely, of course.

379
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,480
Precedent!?
Where do they find these people?

380
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,080
Prime Minister...

381
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
I'm so sorry, Sir.
If there's anything I..

382
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,800
or my government, can do...

383
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,520
They stood up, as we drove past,
in cafés, in restaurants...

384
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,760
removed their hats, this was Paris,
one of the busiest cities in the world...

385
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,560
and you could hear a pin drop.
- I imagine it will be the same here.

386
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,560
The Palace would still prefer
to see this as a private funeral.

387
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,520
What are your feelings on that?

388
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,040
I...

389
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,080
I think that will present us
with difficulties.

390
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,920
So do I...

391
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,280
My mother, The Queen...

392
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,560
comes from a generation of best
equipped... she grew up in the war...

393
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,440
I think.. what we need..
what this country needs...

394
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,600
is a more modern perspective,
if you follow...

395
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,520
- Balmoral is...
- I think I understand...

396
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,680
An aircraft of the Queen's flight...

397
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,560
brought The Princess'
body home this evening...

398
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,480
where the Prime Minister,
Tony Blair, had gathered with

399
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,440
members of his government.

400
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,480
A single black hearse crossed the tarmac...

401
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,360
and a Royal Air Force guard
of honour, moved slowly forward.

402
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,360
Has anyone heard from
the Spencer's yet?

403
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Have they made up their minds
when the funeral will be?

404
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,000
Well I don't know.
Nobody tells me anything.

405
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,520
President Clinton was with his wife,
when he heard the news last night.

406
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,600
We liked her very much...

407
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,800
we admired her work for children...

408
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,440
for people with AIDS, for the cause
of ending the scour of landmines...

409
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,520
On our walk today one of the
ghillies said he'd seen a large stag

410
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,000
up Craggie Head...

411
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,840
He reckoned, 14 pointer.

412
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,280
We haven't had one as big as
that on the estate, for years...

413
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,400
No, quite...

414
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,640
Anyway... I thought it might
be a good distraction...

415
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,320
for the boys.

416
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,560
What.. stalking?

417
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,800
You don't think that's
a bit soon, do you?

418
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,040
I think anything that gets
them outside, is a good idea.

419
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,560
...she became an
increasingly unhappy figure.

420
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,120
The couple divorced
in August of last year.

421
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,400
It was the love story that
brought crowds into the streets...

422
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,440
they came to see The Queen,
of course, and The Prince...

423
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,920
but most of all,
they came to see Diana.

424
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,520
I'm going to bed.

425
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,840
I'll ring the Lord Chamberlain's office.
Say we are going to send

426
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,480
representatives for the meeting
tomorrow morning, 10 o'clock.

427
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,400
Thank you, Stephen.

428
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,560
She gave us so much.

429
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,480
Why couldn't we have
given her a little something...

430
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,400
and left her alone?

431
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,520
It just hurts me so much.

432
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,400
I've never experienced
anything like this. I can't...

433
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,280
I keep waiting to
wake up, like it's a bad dream.

434
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,640
Right, it's 10 o'clock.
Let's get started, shall we?

435
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,680
And thank you all for coming,
at such short notice.

436
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,320
I think we all agree that this is
an extraordinarily sensitive occation...

437
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,920
which presents us
with tremendous challenges.

438
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,640
Modestically, constitutionally...

439
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:31,440
practically, diplomatically
and procedurally.

440
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,720
Christ...

441
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,440
After 18 years of opposition...

442
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,600
I am proud to stand before you,
as the new Prime Minister

443
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,560
of our country...

444
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,240
Labour, Prime Minister.

445
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,920
I want to set an ambitious
course to modernise this country...

446
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,640
to breed new life
in to old institutions.

447
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,040
To make privileged something for
the many... not the few...

448
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,240
Flippin' heck...
You think the royals are nutters?

449
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,400
You should meet their flunkies...

450
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,880
Two and a half hours of
whether she should be carried

451
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,600
in a hearse or a gun carriage.

452
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,040
Anyway, you got raves in the press.

453
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,000
This lot calls you the
nation's mourner-in-chief

454
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,840
This lot says
you're the only person who's

455
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,640
correctly judged,
the mood of the country.

456
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,720
Even The Mail is impressed.

457
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,360
The people's Princess, mate...
you owe me.

458
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,800
Gordon for you...

459
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,800
Tell him to hang on.

460
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,080
Alastair...

461
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,320
So they've come to their senses?
Is it going to be a public funeral?

462
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,440
Yeah, Saturday..
It's a whopper!

463
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,920
- The Abbey, the works...
- Great.

464
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,840
Has anyone told the queen yet?

465
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,160
I don't know. No doubt
some flunkey will be dispatched.

466
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,480
Grovelling on all fours.

467
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,920
Do you think it's wise for
the boys to go stalking so soon?

468
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,800
Anything that gets them into
the fresh air, is a good thing.

469
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,480
Maybe they shouldn't take their guns?
I mean, if a photographer

470
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,120
were to see them, it might send
out the wrong signal?

471
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,760
If there is
a photographer out there...

472
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,320
he could be
the first kill of the day.

473
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,520
I see Mr. Fayed was buried last night...

474
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,480
At midnight.
No cameras, no fuss.

475
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,840
Very dignified.

476
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,200
Why do they do that?
Why do they bury their bodies

477
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,000
so soon after their death?

478
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,920
Islamic tradition...

479
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,840
something to do with the heat.

480
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,720
It stops the body decomposing

481
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,160
Yes, come in!

482
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,280
- Good morning, Ma'am... Ma'am.
- Yes, Robin...

483
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,440
what can we do for you?

484
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:48,280
Ma'am. There was a meeting at
the Palace, this morning...

485
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,440
About the funeral arrangements, yes...

486
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,880
The Lord Chamberlain faxed over
these plans for you to consider.

487
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,760
There is now
general agreement, Ma'am...

488
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:04,000
that a public funeral,
would be more appropriate.

489
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
I see...

490
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,360
And what form will this funeral take?

491
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,240
At the moment they're suggesting...

492
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,600
and of course, these are early days...

493
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,840
basing it on Taye Bridge.

494
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,080
- Taye Bridge?
- What?

495
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:29,120
But Taye Bridge is
to go down for my funeral.

496
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,480
Indeed, Ma'am.

497
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,240
But it would be
for practical reasons only...

498
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,600
it's the only one which
has been... rehearsed.

499
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,760
The only one that could be
put together, in time...

500
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,120
But I supervised
those plans myself...

501
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,160
Indeed...

502
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,560
And the Lord Chamberlain
was at pains to stress

503
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,400
that the spirit of the occasion

504
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,800
will be quite different,
for example...

505
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,000
the suggestion is that
instead of 400 soldiers...

506
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:02,080
400 representatives of the Princess'
various charitys march behind...

507
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,400
the coffin.

508
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,160
And instead of
foreign heads of state...

509
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,880
and crown heads
of Europe...

510
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,640
the guests would include...

511
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,440
a sprinkling of actors
of stage and screen...

512
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,720
fashion designers...

513
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,480
and other... celebrities.
- Celebrities?

514
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,360
Was there anything else?

515
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,960
No, Ma'am.

516
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,360
Oh, yes,
one other thing...

517
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,200
the police commisioner was
keen that you consider...

518
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,880
the idea of a condolence book.

519
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,840
It would give the growing crowds

520
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:49,480
something to do..
make marshaling them easier.

521
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,720
Oh, yes,
yes of course...

522
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,600
- Oh, and the flowers...
- What flowers?

523
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,040
The flowers outside
Buckingham Palace... At the moment

524
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,920
they're blocking the path
through the Main Gate..

525
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,440
and will make things difficult

526
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,200
for the changing of the guards.

527
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,120
Oh, fine.
Just move them away.

528
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,520
Actually, the
Lord Chamberlain was

529
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,760
wondering whether we
shouldn't leave the flowers...

530
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:15,600
and send the guards
through the North Gate

531
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,880
Oh, yes,
yes of course.

532
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,240
Yes,
that's quite right.

533
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,080
Stephen Lamport on one.

534
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,520
- Who?
- The Prince of Wales' private secretary.

535
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,800
- Balmoral.
- He says it's urgent.

536
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,440
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Prime Minister.

537
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,760
The Prince of Wales has asked me
to thank you again

538
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,680
for your kind words yesterday.

539
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,720
Not at all.

540
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,480
The Prince feels that...
you and he...

541
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,120
are both modern men,
of similar mind...

542
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,760
who could work well together,
at this difficult time.

543
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,760
Ah, well..
please thank His Highness

544
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,640
and assure him
he can count on my full support.

545
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,800
At all times.

546
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,160
- Was that it?
- Yes...

547
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,280
Goodbye.

548
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,720
Bizzare.

549
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:30,200
- Why is Charles doing this?
- What?

550
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,880
Creeping up to me like this.

551
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,040
Banging on about being modern.

552
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,280
He did it at the airport, when he
asked me to deal with his mother.

553
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,720
Because he knows that if the Queen
continous to get it wrong over Diana...

554
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,920
then the royals become
public enemy number one.

555
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,040
And he's terrified of
being shot, apparently.

556
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,960
Who, Charles?

557
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,480
His people have already been on
to us.. to ask for extra protection.

558
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,040
He probably thinks that if
he seems to be on our side...

559
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,600
then that would leave
The Queen in the firing line.

560
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,880
What.. so it's okay for his mother
to take the bullet, and not him...

561
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,680
What a family!

562
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,640
- Wait, where are they?
- They're up at Craggie Head.

563
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,920
I'll come with you.
Do you want me to drive?

564
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,440
No, certainly not.

565
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,320
I thought you were going
to get a new one of these?

566
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,200
What for.. it's perfectly alright.

567
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,960
I was thinking last night what Diana
might have done...

568
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,560
had it been me
that died in the tunnel in Paris.

569
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,320
She would certainly
have taken the boys to Paris.

570
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,360
I rather regret
not doing that know.

571
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,440
What, and expose them to the media?

572
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,120
that would have
been a dreadful thing to do.

573
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,800
No, they're much better of here...

574
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,040
it's private, they're protected.

575
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,000
Whatever else you may have thought
of Diana, she was a wonderful mother.

576
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,560
She adored those boys,
and never let them forget it.

577
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,720
Always warm, and physical...

578
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,920
never afraid to show her feelings...

579
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,080
Especially whenever
a photographer was in sight.

580
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,200
She may have encouraged all that,
but still...

581
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,240
that was always the
extraordinary thing about her...

582
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,640
her weaknessess,
and transgressions...

583
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,200
only made the public love her more.

584
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,840
And ours only make them hate us.
Why is that?

585
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,080
Why do they hate us so much?

586
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,040
- Not us, dear...
- What?

587
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,280
Yesterday, when we
brought the coffin back...

588
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:27,040
there was a noise, a bang,
I don't mind telling you...

589
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:27,920
I thought it was a gun.

590
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,120
I thought someone
had taken a shot at me.

591
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,040
I think I'm going to walk back.

592
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,240
I don't feel like stalking.

593
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,600
- Oh, are you sure?
- I'll take the dogs.

594
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,800
Walkies? yes...

595
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,080
Come on...

596
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,560
Do you think...
you'll ever be Queen?

597
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,600
No I don't, no.

598
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,960
Why do you think that?

599
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,120
I like to be a Queen of people's
hearts, in people's hearts.

600
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,920
But I don't see myself as
being Queen of this country.

601
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,280
I don't think many people
would want me to be Queen...

602
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,760
Actually, when
I say many people, I mean

603
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,520
the establishment
that I married into.

604
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:19,000
Because they've decided...
that I'm a non-starter.

605
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,920
Charles and I
had a talk in the car today.

606
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,320
He was good enough to share with me,
his thoughts on motherhood.

607
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,080
What did he say?

608
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,800
How wonderful Diana was...

609
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,720
That's changing his tune.

610
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,880
...and natural.

611
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,040
They see me as
a threat of some kind.

612
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,800
Oh, for Gods sake!

613
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,800
Maybe he's got a point...
Maybe we are partly to blame...

614
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,120
Oh, I can't watch this.

615
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,640
No, no wait..
please, no.. leave it!

616
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,720
We encouraged the match.

617
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,520
We signed of on it, both of us.
You were very enthusiastic, remember?

618
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,760
She was a nice girl.

619
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,280
Then...

620
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,080
And I was sure he'd give
the other one up...

621
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,920
or at least make sure
his wife toed the line.

622
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,920
Isn't that what everyone does?

623
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,000
Is it?

624
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,040
Well, there were three of us,
in this marriage...

625
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,560
so it was a bit crowded.

626
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,160
I can't bear it anymore..

627
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,320
If you're watching,
I'll sleep next door.

628
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,680
Early start tomorrow.

629
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,240
Any luck with your stag?

630
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,360
No, but close.. A couple of
hundred yards at one point.

631
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,440
One of the boys
even got a shot off.

632
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,880
We'll get him tomorrow.

633
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,200
See you in the morning.

634
00:42:58,520 --> 00:42:59,240
Not to worry.

635
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:00,680
Night night.

636
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:10,640
Charles continued to love a woman
he'd fallen for years before...

637
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,800
The good news is that the
Palace has agreed to videoscreens

638
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,960
in the Royal Parks...

639
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,680
- And the bad news?
- Crash barriers...

640
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,560
- What about them?
- Well they're now predicting...

641
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,160
more than two million people
in the center of London.

642
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,480
There aren't enough barriers
to line the route.

643
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,120
So we've gone tapping into
the french for theirs.

644
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,400
And there's something else
I think you should see...

645
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,040
- Can we run that piece again?
- Of course.

646
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,840
You're gonna love this...

647
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,560
I don't like their behaviour..
very disgraceful.

648
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,440
What do you think madam?

649
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:56,160
I think it's disgusting, that they
have not appeared or said a word...

650
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,200
relating to all this.

651
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,400
- Look, I know all this.
- Wait for it..

652
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,320
- Not to have a flag up, I think it's
a disgrace on the whole royal family.

653
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,760
- OK, The Queen's not
in residence today...

654
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,080
but where the hell is the flag?

655
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,960
You see what I'm saying
about the establishment?

656
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:15,280
Don't tell me there isn't a flag flying
at half mast over Buckingham Palace..

657
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,120
To people she was their king and
queen, when them two were together

658
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,600
it was a fairytale come true...

659
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,000
Will someone please save
these people from themselves.

660
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,800
Fine, I'll call Balmoral.

661
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,960
Beause as Prime Minister, I really
got nothing better to do.

662
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,640
Come on dogs, come on...

663
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,800
- Is the firelights alright?
- A bit damp.

664
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,920
Well I brought some stew..
just in case.

665
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,880
I think it's lamb.. we could
always have that cold.

666
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,240
No, we'll be alright.

667
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:54,560
Stay.

668
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:02,320
Robin had a call from the Prime Minister,
who expressed his concern...

669
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,000
About what?

670
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,080
About the flag
above Buckingham Palace.

671
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,280
He thinks it should
be flying at half mast.

672
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,600
I hope Robin told him there
isn't a flag above Buckingham Palace.

673
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,680
There's the Royal Standard,
which flies for one reason only...

674
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,680
to denote the presence
of the monarch.

675
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:23,320
Since you're here, the flag pole
is bare, which is as it should be.

676
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,160
Isn't it possible, that for some people...

677
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,360
the Royal Standard,
is just a flag...

678
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:34,200
And that the flag pole being bare,
sends out the wrong signal..

679
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,600
No, that's not the point.

680
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,240
The point is, it's
more than 400 years old.

681
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,880
It hasn't been
lowered for anyone.

682
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:44,400
Your grandfather didn't get the
flag at half mast, when he died.

683
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:49,240
If you're mother died tomorrow,
she wouldn't either.

684
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:53,200
Yes, granny. But sometimes, in a
situation like this, one has to be flexible.

685
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,640
It is just a flag.

686
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,160
What about the Union Jack?
Was Mr. Blair's next suggestion..

687
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,360
- For heavens sake?
- The next thing he'll be suggesting...

688
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,600
you change your name
to Hilda and mine to Hector.

689
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,080
Who does he think he's
talking to?

690
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,600
You're the Sovereign, the
Head of State...

691
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,400
you don't get dictated to.

692
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,200
You've conceded the idea
of a public funeral...

693
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,160
you've opened up the parks,
that's enough.

694
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,280
Shh... the boys..

695
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,400
You wait.. In 48 hours,
this will all have calmed down.

696
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,560
Where once it seemed comforting...

697
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,280
for the first time
my parents can see...

698
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,800
what it's been like for me
all these years...

699
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,920
being up against her popularity.

700
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,520
But they're still making the mistake
of thinking that the Diana they knew...

701
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,480
from living and dealing with her...

702
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,640
will eventually be the one
seen by the public.. but it won't!

703
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:16,440
The two Dianas, the public's and ours,
bear no relation to one another, at all..

704
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,440
I've been thinking,
the flag of St. George's is

705
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,640
at half mast over High Grove?
- Yes, sir.

706
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,240
Well, make sure we get a picture
of that in the papers, will you?

707
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,560
I'll get on to the tabloids,
call in a few favours.

708
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,760
What about a statement
of gratitude, to the crowds?

709
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,240
something heartfelt,
from myself and the boys...

710
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,320
thanking people
for all the flowers...

711
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,080
and so on.
- Right.

712
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:43,160
Di was wonderful, because she
stood up to the establishment...

713
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:44,760
we have no-one doing that now...

714
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,200
she said you're detached,
elitist people...

715
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:50,240
we are paying million of
pounds to be better than us...

716
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,400
and you gotta get out
there amongst the people...

717
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,000
we have a wonderful new
Prime Minister in England, Tony Blair...

718
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,280
a compassionate young man,
who after 18 years...

719
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,200
of establishment toil and row...

720
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,600
is such a breath of fresh air,
and I feel he will...

721
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,600
do something about this
in England..

722
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,200
Do you think this will
be the first stirings of...

723
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,080
Of what?

724
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,520
I don't know..
something more interesting...

725
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,600
Maybe this time people will finally have
seen them for what they actually are.

726
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,600
Which is?

727
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,400
A bunch of freeloading...

728
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,880
emotionally retarded...

729
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,600
nutters!

730
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,520
- That's just absurd.
- Why?

731
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,080
They have a ludicrous cocoon
of privilege and wealth...

732
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:31,040
and they don't pay tax.
- Yes they do.

733
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:31,880
Not on all their income.

734
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,760
The Queen alone costs us,
what.. 30.. 40 million a year?

735
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,520
Look.. If you wanna have
a serious conversation...

736
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:37,720
- I do..
- About the constitution.

737
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,920
- We don't have one.
- About ways in which
we as a government...

738
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,760
could phase out hereditary
privileges, then fine...

739
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,480
If you're gonna leave
will you take the plates?

740
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:48,640
But, you know, spare me the
whole off with their heads thing.

741
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,240
Why?

742
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,720
Because it insults your intelligence.

743
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,760
The Queen can not
be expected to change...

744
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,120
It's unimaginable this
country being a republic.

745
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,680
- Certainly in her lifetime.
- Why?

746
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,160
Because no-one would wear it...

747
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,840
No-one wants it.

748
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,800
It's just.. daft.

749
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,600
It's not a mother thing, is it?

750
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,040
What?

751
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,680
Well, if she were alive now...

752
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,640
your mother would
be exactly the same age.

753
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,960
I mean.. you always say
how stoical she was...

754
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,920
old-fashioned, uncomplained...

755
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,160
lived through the war..

756
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,960
Oh, come on..
who does that sound like?

757
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,200
I'm gonna go
do the washing-up.

758
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,440
That's the stalking party off...

759
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,200
Right...

760
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,880
I'd better have
a look at those papers.

761
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,520
"Show us there's a heart, in the
house of Windsor", says The Sun.

762
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,040
"It's proof the royals are
not like us", The Mirror.

763
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,760
"Time to change the old guard
at Buckingham Palace", Express.

764
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,280
"One can't help wondering
who's advise they're taking...

765
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,280
for it's clearly
the wrong advise"..

766
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:14,520
I'll try not to take that personally.

767
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:18,240
People have been yearning
for a change in this country...

768
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:21,480
good.. the result is a quiet
revolution now taking place...

769
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,360
lead by the real modernisers..
the British people.

770
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,760
Revolution?
Who wrote this?

771
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,240
Where does this come from?

772
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,960
Where does it come from?

773
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,160
You just won a
huge landslide majority.

774
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,520
People wanna see a change.

775
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,760
Why, what did you
think it meant?

776
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,280
Hurry up dear,
your tea is getting cold.

777
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:45,960
Is that it?

778
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,640
Yes Ma'am, just the
letter of condolence...

779
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,760
to the widow of
the Ambassador to Brasil.

780
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,280
Good, thank you.

781
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,080
Tea!

782
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,520
Mr. Janvrin... The Prime Minister
wishes to speak to Her Majesty.

783
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,000
Ma'am...

784
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Apparently the Prime Minister
is on the phone, for you..

785
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,040
Tell him to call back.

786
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,880
No, no. It's alright.
I'll take it.

787
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,240
Prime Minister...

788
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,520
Good morning, Your Majesty...

789
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:34,520
sorry to disturb..
but I was just wondering

790
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,720
whether you'd seen
any of today's papers?

791
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,000
We've managed to
look at one or two...

792
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,760
In which case my...

793
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,240
next question would be...

794
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,520
whether you felt some kind of
response, might be necessary?

795
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,360
No... I believe a few,
over eager editors...

796
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,000
are doing their best
to sell newspapers...

797
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,480
and it would be a mistake
to dance to their tune..

798
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,680
Under normal circumstances
I would agree.

799
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:08,360
But.. well, my advise is...

800
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,480
I've been taking the temperature
among people on the streets..

801
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,760
And.. well, the
information I'm getting...

802
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,840
is that the mood...

803
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,680
is quite delicate...

804
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,720
So, what would you suggest,
Prime Minister?

805
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,600
Some kind of a statement?

806
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:32,440
No, Ma'am. I believe that the
moment for statements, has passed..

807
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,040
I would suggest flying the flag
at half mast above Buckingham Palace...

808
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:46,800
and coming down to London,
at the earliest opportunity.

809
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:49,760
It would be a
great comfort to your people...

810
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,880
and would help them
with their grief.

811
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,880
Their.. grief?

812
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,880
If you imagine I am going
to drop everything, and come

813
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,160
down to London, before I
attend to my grandchildren...

814
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,520
who have just lost their mother..

815
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:07,600
then you're mistaken!

816
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,000
I doubt there is anyone,
who knows

817
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,120
the British people
more than I do, Mr. Blair...

818
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,320
nor who has greater faith
in their wisdom and judgement.

819
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:22,400
And it is my belief they will any
moment reject this.. this mood...

820
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,000
which is being stired up
by the press.

821
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,280
In favour of a period of
restrained grief...

822
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,800
and sober private mourning.

823
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,480
That's the way we do
things in this country...

824
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:39,400
quietly.. with dignity.

825
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,960
That's what the rest of
the world has always admired us for.

826
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,040
If that's your decision, Ma'am...

827
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,120
then of course,
the government will support it..

828
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,680
Let's keep in touch.

829
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,120
Yes. Let's.

830
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,000
Bloody fool...

831
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,880
and now your tea's gone cold.

832
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,240
Tony... Robin Janvrin on one.

833
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:12,960
He was listening in..

834
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,040
Robin.

835
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,360
I understand how
difficult her behaviour must

836
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,880
seem to you.
How unhelpful...

837
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,960
but try to see it from her perspective.
She's been brought up to believe...

838
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,680
it's God's will...

839
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:32,320
she is who she is.

840
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:34,840
I think we should
leave God out of it.

841
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,760
It's just..
not helpful.

842
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,960
she just won't have seen anything
like this since the abdication...

843
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:44,200
and I can not emphasise enough
what affect that had on her.

844
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,600
Unexpectedly becoming King
as good as killed her father.

845
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,760
I'm afraid she's in
a state of shock.

846
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,680
This public reaction
has completely thrown her.

847
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,280
Alright...

848
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,720
but first we have to
deal with these terrible headlines.

849
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:02,440
I'll see what I can do
with the press.

850
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,080
I'm most grateful,
Prime Minister.

851
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,520
Well I can't promise anything...

852
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,200
it's not me they want to see.

853
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,520
Ask Alastair to come and see me.

854
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,840
Yes...

855
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,920
Cancel what I'm doing tonight.

856
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:49,040
Good morning.

857
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,400
- Your Majesty.
- Morning, Ma'am.

858
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,400
Thomas.. where have
they gone today?

859
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,120
Up to Ardverikie Reach, Ma'am.

860
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,280
All that way.. Remind me..
that's the track up north..

861
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,120
That's right, Ma'am.. You follow
the track for about a mile...

862
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,680
- and then you come to...
- The river.

863
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,000
- One of the lads will drive you..
- No, no. I'll manage.. thank you.

864
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,280
Oh great..

865
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,920
Oh! Stupid..

866
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,560
- Hello, Thomas..
- Hello, Ma'am...

867
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,440
I'm afraid I've done
something rather foolish.

868
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,320
I've broken the
prop shaft crossing the river.

869
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,760
- Are you sure, Ma'am?
- Yes, of course I'm sure.

870
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,600
It's the front one, not the rear.

871
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,520
It was a four-wheel drive.

872
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,840
Don't forget.. I used to be a
mechanic during the war.

873
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,880
- And, are you alright?
- Yeah yeah, I'm perfectly alright...

874
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,040
- We'll come about straight away.
- Oh, would you.. Thank you very much.

875
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:22,840
I'll wait by the car.
You are kind.. bye.

876
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,760
Oh.. you're a beauty..

877
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,400
Shoo.. go on!

878
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:04,160
go on... go on..

879
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,560
Just been told
there are news crews outside...

880
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,640
waiting for you to
come and speak to the people..

881
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,520
- Yes...
- What's all that about?

882
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,200
I told The
Queen's private secretary

883
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,840
I'd do what I could,
to help with the press.

884
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:54,440
Why?
Don't you think she deserves it?

885
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,600
Sitting up there
on her 40000 acres.

886
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:01,320
Yeah, but allowing her to hang herself,
might not be in our best interest either.

887
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:05,960
Besides... I think there's something...

888
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:09,080
ugly, about the way
everyone started to bully her..

889
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,520
The first thing you
obviously think about, is...

890
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:35,000
the rest of your family.
And I think..

891
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:44,720
she wanted me to pass on to
the people here, crowding around her...

892
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,000
How are the boys?

893
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,240
Not so good, tonight.

894
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:56,200
A lot of slamming doors..
I think they saw the papers.

895
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,560
Oh no..

896
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:59,560
I'll take them out early
again, tomorrow morning...

897
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,160
Let them take
it out on the stag.

898
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:09,000
What do you think of the way
the royal family have behaved?

899
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,160
- They've made a serious mistake.
- Pardon?

900
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,880
They've made a serious mistake.

901
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:14,480
Why, what do you mean?

902
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:19,720
Well, they should have came...
the family should have come down...

903
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:23,800
to Buckingham Palace, on
sunday afternoon.. all of them...

904
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,800
That girl has been left on her own.
She's on her own up there...

905
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:28,880
and the place is empty.

906
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,960
Oh please...

907
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,520
Sleeping in the streets and
pulling out their hair...

908
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:37,160
for someone they never knew..

909
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,680
and they think we're mad.

910
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,680
Have you seen the latest
funeral guest list?

911
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:42,720
No...

912
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,840
I suggest you keep it that way..

913
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:48,000
A chorus line of soap stars
and homosexuals..

914
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,640
Apparently Elton John
is going to be singing.

915
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:54,240
That would be a first
for Westminster Abbey.

916
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,120
Condolence books are now being
signed in our embassies

917
01:02:58,120 --> 01:02:59,840
in every major city
in the world.

918
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:03,040
And in London alone,
the number has reached 40.

919
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,720
It reminds me of one
of those films.

920
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:08,920
A few of us in a fort...

921
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:11,640
hordes of Zulus outside.

922
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,040
So it's vital you hold firm.

923
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:17,040
Stick to your guns...

924
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:20,400
you wait.. they will
come to their senses soon..

925
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,640
they have to.

926
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:25,440
Come on!
Move over cabbage!

927
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,840
Good morning,
it's 6 o'clock on Thursday

928
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,560
the 4th of september.
I'm Penny Smith...

929
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,880
and I'm Matthew Lorenzo..

930
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,360
as the first people
start camping out...

931
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,120
on the route of Princess
Dianas funeral courtage...

932
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,280
 questions are being asked
about why the Queen...

933
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,240
hasn't addressed her subjects...

934
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,200
at this time of national grief.

935
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,880
This is what the newspapers
are saying this morning. The Sun...

936
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:55,920
Where is our Queen?
Where is her flag?

937
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:04,400
The Express,
show us you care...

938
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,520
picture of a grumpy Queen.

939
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,800
The Mail, let the
flag fly at half mast...

940
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:12,320
and inside.. the Queen should
be here to show her respect.

941
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:16,960
But the flip side is,
they're more popular now...

942
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,480
than Churchill's chocolate.

943
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:21,000
Did any of them pick up
on our statement of support?

944
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,400
Well, just the one...

945
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,200
Statements of support,
doesn't sell papers.

946
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,640
Ma'am... Ma'am...

947
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,280
the Prime Minister
for you, Ma'am.

948
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,840
I'm afraid he's rather insisting.

949
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,400
I'll take it in the kitchen.

950
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,640
Good morning,
I'm so sorry to disturb you.

951
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:00,200
I'm just expecting a
phone call to come through here.

952
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,640
Out!

953
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:05,280
Oh, there it is..

954
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,240
Thank you.

955
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:17,280
- Good morning, Prime Minister.
- Good morning, Ma'am.

956
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,520
You've seen today's headlines?

957
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:22,360
Yes, I have.

958
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:26,600
Then I'm sure you'll agree..
the situation has become..

959
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,080
quite critical.

960
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:32,640
Ma'am?

961
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,120
A poll that's to be published in
tomorrow's papers...

962
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,840
suggests that
70 procent of people believe

963
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,720
that your actions
have damaged the Monarchy.

964
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:47,040
And that, one in four,
are now in favour...

965
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,240
of abolishing the Monarchy
all together.

966
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:53,040
As your Prime Minister...

967
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:57,120
I believe it is my
constitutional responsibility...

968
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,280
to advise the following...

969
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,000
Is Queen Elizabeth up yet?

970
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,040
Mummy?

971
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:28,760
one.. fly the flag at half mast
above Buckingham Palace

972
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,720
and all other
royal residences...

973
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:37,480
two.. leave Balmoral and fly down
to London at the earliest opportunity...

974
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:43,480
three.. pay respects,
in person, at Diana's coffin...

975
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:48,760
and four.. make a statement
via live television...

976
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,680
to my people
and the world.

977
01:06:52,600 --> 01:06:56,240
Swift prosecution of
these matters might, he felt...

978
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:59,080
just might..
avert disaster.

979
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,960
You will have to talk to the
Lord Chamberlain about all this.

980
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:03,560
Well I have..

981
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:07,360
and to Robert Fellows, and it
seems they both agree with Mr. Blair.

982
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,520
Oh, I see...

983
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,160
Something's happened..
there's been a change.. some...

984
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:14,640
shift in values.

985
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:18,880
When you no longer
understand your people, mummy...

986
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,920
maybe it is time to
hand it over to the next generation?

987
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:23,440
Oh, don't be ridiculous..

988
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,440
remember the vow you took?

989
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:32,280
I declare that my whole life,
whether it be long or short...

990
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:34,360
shall be devoted to your service.

991
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,200
Your whole life.

992
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,880
That is a commitment to God...

993
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:41,120
as well as your people.

994
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,720
But what if my actions
are damaging the Crown?

995
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:45,360
Damaging it!?

996
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,840
You're the greatest asset
this institution has...

997
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,480
one of the greatest
it has ever had.

998
01:07:53,240 --> 01:07:58,960
The problem will come when you leave..
but you mustn't think about that now...

999
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:00,400
Certainly not today.

1000
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,480
Oh, mummy..

1001
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:04,080
You must show your strenght...

1002
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,440
reasert your authority.

1003
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:11,160
You sit on the most
powerful throne in Europe.

1004
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:15,560
Head of an unbroken line that
goes back more than a thousand years.

1005
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:19,800
Do you think any of your predecessors
would have dropped everything...

1006
01:08:19,800 --> 01:08:23,480
and gone up to London
because a bunch of hysterics..

1007
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,720
carrying candles,
needed help with their grief?

1008
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,600
As for that...

1009
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:34,880
silly Mr. Blair..
with his Cheshire Cat grin...

1010
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,400
Mr. Janvrin on the
phone for you, Sir..

1011
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:54,720
Yes?

1012
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,120
What?

1013
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:58,160
I can't hear!

1014
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,840
That's madness...
the whole thing!

1015
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,960
Bloody madness!

1016
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:11,560
I've just been told...

1017
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:17,080
You've... decided to follow the
Prime Minister's advise...

1018
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:19,520
I just want to say, I...

1019
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,320
admire...

1020
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,680
I think it's the right decision.

1021
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:30,560
Let's hope we haven't
left it too late.

1022
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:18,360
Clearly The Queen
has had a change of heart...

1023
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,520
she's clearly responding to
the need to feel...

1024
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:23,520
that the royal family
is somehow engaged.

1025
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,760
These are flowers that have been
brought to the gates of Balmoral...

1026
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,080
so that she can actually see

1027
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:32,040
some token, of what's been
expressed down here in London..

1028
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,560
- Fish Fingers.. do you want any?
- I'll be right there..

1029
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,280
Thank God, for that!

1030
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:12,880
Britain's Queen Elisabeth will
deliver a televised address Friday...

1031
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:15,960
the royal family has been accused
of not showing enough remorse...

1032
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:17,440
over Princess Diana's death...

1033
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,360
Where are the boys?
Have they already left?

1034
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:41,080
Yes...

1035
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,960
they left for London,
after breakfast, with Charles.

1036
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:47,280
It's not right, you know...

1037
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,200
No, but further discussion
is no longer helpful, either.

1038
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,880
Oh, well..

1039
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,520
I suppose it does give the ghillies time
to find another stag for the boys.

1040
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,760
- Now there's has been shot.
- What?

1041
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,280
Haven't you heard?

1042
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,960
He wandered over to one
of the neighbouring estates...

1043
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,600
where one of the
commercial guests got him.

1044
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:11,600
Oh.. really?

1045
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:14,800
Which estate?

1046
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:33,400
Here's your box.

1047
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,840
There's some policy and
stuff in here that's important.

1048
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:38,360
Have you seen the papers?

1049
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:41,000
No, I thought I'd give them a miss today..
of course I've seen the papers!

1050
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:45,400
Not bad, eh.. Your Majesty
have come down to London...

1051
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,680
Who says that?
Tony Blair.

1052
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:50,480
Mr. Father of the nation.

1053
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:08,520
Ma'am...

1054
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,680
- Good morning, Ma'am.
- Good morning.

1055
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,720
Is it his Lordship,
you've come to see?

1056
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:16,400
No, please don't disturb him..
I've come on another matter..

1057
01:13:16,400 --> 01:13:17,760
I hope you don't mind?

1058
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:39,960
There he is..

1059
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,480
a beauty, isn't he?

1060
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,840
An imperial, Ma'am.

1061
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,200
14 pointer.

1062
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,200
- He was wounded?
- Yes...

1063
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:05,880
We got our guest in very close..
had him lined up perfect.

1064
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:08,560
And still...

1065
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:12,080
an investment banker, Ma'am..
from London.

1066
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:16,320
I'm afraid the stalkers had to
follow him for miles, to finish him off..

1067
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,640
Let's hope he didn't suffer too much.

1068
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,280
Please pass my congratulations,
to your guest.

1069
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:35,160
I will, Ma'am...

1070
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:44,120
God bless you, Ma'am.

1071
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,360
Thank you.

1072
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,880
- Ma'am?
- Yes, Robin...

1073
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:22,800
I've done a draft,
of your television address.

1074
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:23,880
Thank you.

1075
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:29,920
Was there anything else?

1076
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:32,400
No, Ma'am.

1077
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,360
Landing in 15 minutes.

1078
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:47,880
I've got The Queen's speech.

1079
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:52,520
- Shall I give Tony a copy?
- No, let me have a look at it first...

1080
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,520
- He's next door.

1081
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:47,200
The Queen is getting out of the car...
and is going to talk to people.

1082
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:51,040
It's extremely unusual..
this is almost unprecedented..

1083
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:54,440
I think perhaps the last time
The Queen was among her people...

1084
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:58,560
outside the Palace..
was the day the war in Europe ended.

1085
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,480
They sent a copy
of The Queen's speech...

1086
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,600
Well, let's get the frost off it first.

1087
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,680
I've phoned them
with a couple of suggestions...

1088
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,200
to make it sound like it
came from a human being.

1089
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:40,120
Yeah, alright Alastair..

1090
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:45,840
Well at least the old bat has
finally agreed to visit Diana's coffin.

1091
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,360
When you get it wrong,
you really get it wrong...

1092
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,920
that woman has given her
whole life in service to her people.

1093
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,560
50 years doing the job,
she never wanted...

1094
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,560
a job she watched kill her father...

1095
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:02,000
she's executed it with honour, dignity,
and as far as I could tell...

1096
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,800
without a single blemish,
and now we're all baying for her blood.

1097
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,600
All because she's struggling
to lead the world in mourning

1098
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:10,360
for someone who threw everything
she offered back in her face.

1099
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:13,120
and who for the last few years
seemed commited 24/7

1100
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,840
to destroying everything
she holds most dear.

1101
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:21,520
Hello.. would you like
me to place those for you?

1102
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:22,600
No...

1103
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,520
Oh...

1104
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,080
These are for you.

1105
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:29,880
For me?

1106
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:34,760
Thank you.

1107
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,120
Thank you very much.

1108
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:10,440
There's been a last minute
addition from Downing Street.

1109
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:13,040
They're suggesting adding,
'and as a grandmother'...

1110
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,760
here.
- Right.

1111
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:23,840
So what I say to you now, as
your Queen, and as a grandmother...

1112
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,440
I say from my heart.

1113
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,360
You think you can say it?

1114
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:32,440
- Do I have a choice?
- We're ready for you, Your Majesty.

1115
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,920
Just to confirm,
this is going out live.

1116
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,720
- Fine.
- And you'll be at the front of

1117
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,520
the 6 o'clock news..
on all the channels.

1118
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,920
Yes.

1119
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:26,920
- Okay, nice and quiet..
- Ten seconds, everyone!

1120
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,960
We cross now, live,
to Buckingham Palace...

1121
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:36,480
for the Queen's tribute
to Princess Diana.

1122
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:45,120
Since last Sundays'
dreadful news...

1123
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,800
we have seen throughout Britain,
and around the world...

1124
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:51,720
an overwhelming expression
of sadness at Diana's death.

1125
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,800
We have all been trying,
in our different ways, to cope...

1126
01:21:57,680 --> 01:22:00,200
it is not easy
to express a sense of loss...

1127
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,560
since the initial shock,
is often succeeded

1128
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:04,520
by a mixture
of other feelings...

1129
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:09,760
disbelief, incomprehension, anger..
and concern for those who remain.

1130
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:16,040
We have all felt those
emotions in these last few days...

1131
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:20,320
so what I say to you now,
as your Queen, and as a grandmother...

1132
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,560
I say from my heart.

1133
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,880
Heart..
What heart?

1134
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,800
She doesn't mean a word of this.

1135
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,080
That's not the point.
What she's doing is extraordinary.

1136
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,040
That's how to survive.

1137
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,320
Listen to you..

1138
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:39,600
a week ago you were the
great moderniser...

1139
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:42,120
making speeches
about the people's Princess.

1140
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,600
Now you've gone weak at the knees.

1141
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:50,560
You know.. I don't know
why I'm so surprised..

1142
01:22:51,240 --> 01:22:53,200
at the end of the day,
all Labour Prime Ministers...

1143
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,320
go ga-ga for the Queen.

1144
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,360
What?

1145
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:08,160
I, for one, believe that there are
lessons to be drawn from her life...

1146
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:11,720
and from the extraordinary,
and moving, reaction to her death.

1147
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:16,640
I share in your determination,
to cherish her memory.

1148
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:21,160
I hope that tomorrow we
can all, wherever we are...

1149
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:24,760
join in expressing our grief,
at Diana's loss...

1150
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,720
and gratitude for her
all too short life.

1151
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:31,120
May those who died,
rest in peace...

1152
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,080
and may we,
each and everyone of us...

1153
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:39,560
thank God, for someone who
made many, many people, happy.

1154
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,200
Diana's coffin, now on the move...

1155
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,360
the short distance
from St. James' Palace...

1156
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,720
to her home at Kensington
Palace, for the final night...

1157
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:56,480
before her burial tomorrow.

1158
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,200
It's incredible...

1159
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,920
less than a week.

1160
01:24:01,400 --> 01:24:03,360
Who could have imagined,
such scenes?

1161
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:19,360
Diana was the very essence
of compassion, of duty...

1162
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,880
of style, of beauty.

1163
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:24,080
A very British girl...

1164
01:25:24,080 --> 01:25:26,240
who transcended nationality.

1165
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,040
Someone with
a natural nobility...

1166
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,560
who was classless, and who
proved in the last year...

1167
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,040
that she needed no royal title
to continue to generate...

1168
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,920
a particular brand of magic.

1169
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:44,160
I would like to end by,
thanking God...

1170
01:25:44,160 --> 01:25:46,880
for the small mercies he's
shown us at this dreadful time...

1171
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,960
for taking Diana at
her most beautiful and radiant.

1172
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,160
And when she had joy,
in her private life.

1173
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:56,560
Above all, we give thanks
for the life of a woman...

1174
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,240
I'm so proud
to be able to call my sister.

1175
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:02,080
The uniqe, the complexed...

1176
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:05,120
the extraordinary,
and irreplaceable, Diana.

1177
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,520
Who's beauty, both internal
and external...

1178
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:11,320
will never be extinguished
from our minds.

1179
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:09,560
- So, off to see your girlfriend?
- Now, now.

1180
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,920
You know, I hope she
shows you some respect this time.

1181
01:27:13,640 --> 01:27:15,760
It's quite a debt of gratitude,
she owes you.

1182
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,880
Mr. Saviour of the Monarchy.

1183
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,400
I doubt she'll see it that way..

1184
01:27:26,760 --> 01:27:28,680
- Robin.. good to see you.
- Prime Minister.

1185
01:27:28,680 --> 01:27:29,560
Tony, please.

1186
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,680
The Prime Minister,
Your Majesty.

1187
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,440
Do sit down.

1188
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,520
Thank you.

1189
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,400
It's good to see you again.

1190
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,800
After what's been..
quite a summer.

1191
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,680
I'm refering to your visit
to India.. and Pakistan.

1192
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:17,080
Where your comments on
ending historic disagreements...

1193
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:18,880
went down very well.

1194
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,520
On the commonwealth heads
of government meeting...

1195
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,720
I spoke to the Prime Minister of Malawi...

1196
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:28,120
and he was saying
how much he appreciated your...

1197
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:30,520
tough stands on Nigeria...

1198
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,320
I meant to tell you at the time, but...

1199
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,720
you were being monopolised, rather...

1200
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:41,160
I imagine those occations
must be quite difficult.

1201
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:46,320
24 heads of government, each
clamouring for a private audience.

1202
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:55,080
Also we have another
chance to speak, since.. that week.

1203
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:00,120
And I wanted to offer my apologies.

1204
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,440
Whatever for?

1205
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:05,880
In case you felt manhandled, or..
managed, in any way.

1206
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:07,240
No, not at all.

1207
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:16,360
I don't think I shall ever understand,
what happened this summer.

1208
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:20,480
Well.. the circumstances
were exceptional, Ma'am..

1209
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:24,440
and in the end you
showed great personal strenght...

1210
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:26,920
courage and humility.

1211
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:29,480
You're confusing humility,
with humiliation.

1212
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:30,920
That's not true.

1213
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:34,760
You didn't read the cards on the
flowers outside the Palace, that Friday.

1214
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,680
I actually think history will show,
it was a good week for you.

1215
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:40,640
And an even better one
for you, Mr. Blair.

1216
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,920
But there are 52 weeks
in the year, Ma'am...

1217
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:48,720
and 2500 in the time
since you've been Queen.

1218
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:54,200
And when people come
to assess your legacy...

1219
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,360
they won't remember those few days.
- Oh, really?

1220
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:01,320
You don't think what affection
people once had for...

1221
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:04,080
for this institution...

1222
01:30:05,160 --> 01:30:06,200
has been diminished?

1223
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:07,200
No...

1224
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:08,520
not at all.

1225
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,560
You're more respected now,
than ever...

1226
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:15,400
I gather some of your closest advisers
were less fulsome in their support.

1227
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:18,120
One or two...

1228
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:22,880
but as a leader, I could never
have added my voice to that chorus.

1229
01:30:22,880 --> 01:30:24,040
Because you saw those headlines,
and you thought...

1230
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:26,160
one day that might happen to me.

1231
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,320
And it will, Mr. Blair.

1232
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,920
Quite suddenly, and without warning.

1233
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,160
So.. shall we get on
with the business in hand?

1234
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:41,320
Oh, look...

1235
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:45,600
I do love this time of day.

1236
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,520
Shall we walk, while there is still light?

1237
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,400
You know the clocks go back
next week, it will be dark before five.

1238
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:53,480
- I do hope you're a walker?
- I am...

1239
01:30:53,480 --> 01:30:56,520
Good.. I always think these meetings
have a far greater chance of success...

1240
01:30:56,520 --> 01:30:58,520
if the Prime Minister is a walker.

1241
01:30:59,560 --> 01:31:01,560
As a matter of fact,  that's
how I think best.. on my feet..

1242
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:04,600
I've never been one
for sitting around endlessly...

1243
01:31:04,600 --> 01:31:07,160
a good walk and fresh air
sorts everything out.

1244
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,680
One in four.. you said..
wanted to get rid of me.

1245
01:31:15,680 --> 01:31:17,400
For about half an hour.

1246
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:19,200
But then...

1247
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:22,360
you came down to London,
and all that went away.

1248
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:27,320
I've never been hated
like that before.

1249
01:31:27,800 --> 01:31:29,760
Then, that
must have been difficult..

1250
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,600
Yes...

1251
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,040
very.

1252
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:40,880
Nowadays people want glamour,
and tears, the grand performance.

1253
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:43,480
I'm not very good at that,
I never have been...

1254
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,200
I prefer to keep
my feelings to myself.

1255
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:51,920
And foolishly I believed that was
what people wanted from their Queen...

1256
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:55,200
not to make a fuss, nor wear one's
heart on one's sleeve...

1257
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,440
duty first, self second.

1258
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,880
That's how I was brought up...

1259
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:04,200
that's all I've ever known.

1260
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:06,720
You were so young
when you became Queen.

1261
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:14,120
Yes...

1262
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:17,600
Yes, a girl.

1263
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:25,760
But I can see
that the world has changed...

1264
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:30,080
and one must.. modernise.

1265
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:34,680
Well, perhaps that's where I can help.

1266
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:38,480
Don't get ahead of yourself,
Prime Minister, and remember...

1267
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,040
I am the one
supposed to be advising you.

1268
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,040
I am the one
supposed to be advising you.
