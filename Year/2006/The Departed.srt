1
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,298
<i>I don't wanna be a product
of my environment.</i>

2
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:47,112
<i>I want my environment
to be a product of me.</i>

3
00:00:50,316 --> 00:00:52,580
<i>Years ago, we had the Church.</i>

4
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:57,381
<i>That was only a way
of saying we had each other.</i>

5
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,921
But now, I don't know.
It's a funny thing.

6
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:04,290
It put hate in your heart.

7
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:07,862
<i>The Knights of Columbus were
real head-breakers.</i>

8
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,262
<i>True guineas.</i>

9
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,961
<i>They took over their piece of the city.</i>

10
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:18,537
<i>Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get
a fucking job...</i>

11
00:01:18,711 --> 00:01:22,841
<i>...we had the presidency.
May he rest in peace.</i>

12
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,316
<i>That's what the niggers don't realize.</i>

13
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:30,752
<i>If I got one thing
against the black chappies, it's this:</i>

14
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,051
<i>No one gives it to you.</i>

15
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,126
<i>You have to take it.</i>

16
00:01:56,583 --> 00:02:00,349
Vin, don't make me have
to come down here again for this.

17
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,011
Won't happen again, Mr. C.

18
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:09,457
Carmen's developing
into a fine young lady.

19
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,722
You should be proud.

20
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,102
You get your period yet, Carmen?

21
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:45,230
You Johnny Sullivan's kid?

22
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,398
- You live with your grandmother?
- Yeah.

23
00:02:50,703 --> 00:02:54,935
Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread,
couple half-gallons of milk.

24
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,668
Do you like bologna and cheese?
Give him some cold cuts.

25
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:02,406
Throw some mayo in.
You like comic books?

26
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,275
You do good in school?

27
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:11,423
- Yeah.
- That's good. I did too.

28
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:14,185
They call that a paradox.

29
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:19,294
Just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup.

30
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:29,066
You ever wanna earn a little extra money,
you come by L Street.

31
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,938
You know where I am on L Street?

32
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,738
Good.

33
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:36,438
- Good boy.
- Thanks.

34
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:42,382
To you, O Lord, we commend the soul
of Alphonsus, your servant.

35
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:44,546
In the sight of this world,
he is now dead.

36
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,852
Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness.

37
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,325
<i>- Amen.
- The Church wants you in your place.</i>

38
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:53,056
Kneel, stand, kneel, stand.

39
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,725
If you go for that sort of thing,
I don't know what to do for you.

40
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,064
A man makes his own way.

41
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,831
No one gives it to you.

42
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:02,872
You have to take it.

43
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,311
- James Joyce.
- Smart, Colin.

44
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,945
Guineas from the North End,
down Providence...

45
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,812
...tried to tell me what to do.

46
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:16,752
And something maybe happened to them.

47
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,924
Maybe like that:

48
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:31,428
Jeez. She fell funny.

49
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,840
Francis, you really should see somebody.

50
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:40,309
<i>When you decide to be something,
you can be it.</i>

51
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,745
That's what they don't tell you
in the Church.

52
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:48,444
When I was your age, they would say
we could become cops or criminals.

53
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,385
Today what I'm saying to you is this:

54
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:55,118
When you're facing a loaded gun...

55
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,260
...what's the difference?

56
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,233
<i>That's my boy.</i>

57
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:07,535
Terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile...

58
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,403
...as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes.

59
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:13,670
Take, for instance, what you carry,
9mm hollow-point.

60
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:17,475
When the hollow-point hits the skull,
what happens is it mushrooms.

61
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,517
<i>When it mushrooms it peels back.
So you may have six, eight...</i>

62
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,850
...ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades...

63
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,149
Sir, yes, sir!

64
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,761
<i>...tearing their internal organs,
their liver, their lungs, their heart...</i>

65
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:32,489
...bringing tissue, bone, blood,
brain matter, and that's called a blowback.

66
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,564
Fuck you. Fucking queers.

67
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:46,542
Firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy.

68
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:50,410
Hey, go save a kitten in a tree,
you fucking homos.

69
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,374
Pencils.

70
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,420
Begin.

71
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,158
What are you looking at?

72
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,372
Forget it.

73
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,169
Your father was a janitor,
his son's only a cop.

74
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:24,448
Those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos.

75
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:26,412
They are.

76
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:30,147
So she tells me, "You never finish anything.
You finish the police course...

77
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:35,761
...you get taken care of again, baby."
So after graduation, I get a blowjob again.

78
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:38,761
That's great.
Your mother must be a wonderful woman.

79
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:39,955
Fuck yourself.

80
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,499
Put it this way.
You're a black guy in Boston.

81
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,228
You don't need any help from me
to be completely fucked.

82
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,670
The Massachusetts State Police
has a long tradition of excellence.

83
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:52,341
Your graduation today solidifies
your acceptance...

84
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,606
...into one of the finest law enforcement
agencies in our nation.

85
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:59,548
As the governor of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, I am confident...

86
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:05,089
...each and every one of you will serve
with distinction, honor and integrity.

87
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,192
Congratulations to all our new troopers.

88
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,454
Thank you. You are dismissed.

89
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,669
Sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right out
of the gate, congratulations.

90
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:28,610
- We're going for a beer. You wanna come?
- No, I'll catch up with you guys.

91
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:39,549
School's out.

92
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,262
Thank you, Frank.

93
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,053
You earned it.

94
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:48,291
No more pencils, no more books.

95
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:51,992
All right.

96
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:53,695
<i>This is not the regular police...</i>

97
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,773
<i>- ... this is the state police.
- And fire!</i>

98
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,068
<i>Your training will illustrate the difference.</i>

99
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,940
State police, search warrant!
State police, open the door!

100
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:02,478
<i>What's the difference?</i>

101
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:05,048
<i>- Go, go, go!
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

102
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,278
<i>- Is that understood?
- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

103
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:11,617
Move it, get the fuck down right now.
Get down, right now.

104
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:25,536
Congratulations on passing
the detective's exam, and welcome...

105
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:29,197
- ... to the Special Investigation Unit.
- Whoop-de-fucking-do.

106
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,242
We won't be working together,
that is, directly.

107
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:36,245
You'll be working for Captain Ellerby,
but I like to see everybody.

108
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,914
You're a worker. You rise fast.

109
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,078
Like a 12-year-old's dick.

110
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,285
- Thank you, sergeant.
- My pleasure.

111
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,826
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

112
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:59,229
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, hon.

113
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,032
You can go in there now.

114
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,943
You can sit.

115
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,622
So...

116
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,559
Do you know what we do here?
My section?

117
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,526
- Yes, sir, I have an idea...
- Let's say you have no idea...

118
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,394
...and leave it at that, okay?

119
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,060
No idea. Zip. None.

120
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:36,164
If you had an idea what we do, we would
not be good at what we do, would we?

121
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,866
We would be cunts.

122
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,069
Are you calling us cunts?

123
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,646
Staff Sergeant Dignam
has a style of his own.

124
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:45,750
I'm afraid we all have to get used to it.

125
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:50,379
So you have family connections down
in Southie, right? Through your father?

126
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:53,081
Why don't you tell us
about your Uncle Jackie?

127
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,898
He was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.

128
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:04,365
Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie
who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.

129
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:08,268
He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
We found his body out by the airport.

130
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:12,374
That's right.

131
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,937
- I remember his funeral.
- Oh, good.

132
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,343
Closed casket?

133
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,781
That's right.

134
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:23,322
So tell anybody up at Deerfield...

135
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,617
Before you got kicked out for whaling
on a gym teacher with a chair.

136
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:29,192
...you had an uncle met his demise
like that?

137
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,133
I got a question.

138
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,360
How fucked up are you?

139
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,774
Hi, Darlene.

140
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:57,183
What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.

141
00:10:57,757 --> 00:11:02,160
- SIU. What a country.
- Perfect.

142
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:06,291
Hey, I don't mind going it alone.

143
00:11:06,465 --> 00:11:09,593
You know, if you went alone once
in a while you might get somewhere.

144
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,431
We're cops, all right?
This isn't somewhere.

145
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:17,341
All right, lookit, I know you're a worker.
Maybe I can do something for you.

146
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,606
You got any suits,
or do you like...

147
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,612
...coming to work dressed like
you're gonna invade Poland?

148
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,614
You got quite the family tree.
That maggot uncle of yours...

149
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:31,154
...Tommy Costigan, is another goof.
He gets busted selling guns...

150
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:34,349
...to federal officers, among many,
many, many other departures...

151
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,860
- ... from our normative behavior.
- And what's this got to do with me?

152
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,793
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

153
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:47,136
This unit is new, and you are
the newest members of it.

154
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:50,867
You have been selected for it
on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.

155
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:54,137
This is an elite unit.

156
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:58,579
Our job is to smash
or marginally disrupt...

157
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:00,810
...organized crime in this city...

158
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,716
...by enhanced cooperation
with the FBI...

159
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,653
...represented here today
by Agent Frank Lazio.

160
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,987
And we will do it.

161
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,619
And by organized crime in this city,
you know who we mean.

162
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,093
That's Jackie Costigan.
That's an old picture.

163
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:17,326
Jackie met his demise.

164
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,433
Last known photograph.

165
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,065
Costello uses three key guys.

166
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,769
That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho,
lives in Brockton with his mother.

167
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,642
<i>She's straight out of Going My Way.</i>

168
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,908
Delahunt, muscle.

169
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:36,043
French, the number one.
But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.

170
00:12:36,222 --> 00:12:38,952
We've done a briefing book, so read up.
I want all ideas...

171
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,286
...so I can pass them off as my own.

172
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,588
Work hard, you'll rise fast.
You're in the best possible position...

173
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,527
...in the department.
Let's go to work.

174
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:48,996
Your old man was a fucking hump
from Southie.

175
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,137
Baggage handler at the airport, right?

176
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,772
Family's all criminals except
for the old man, huh?

177
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,408
And one priest, since you seem
to know everything.

178
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:01,444
Last I heard he was married to a 12-year-old
boy, living on a beach in Thailand.

179
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:04,515
Fucking family's dug
into the Southie projects like ticks.

180
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:06,981
Three-decker men at best.
You, however, grew up...

181
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:11,021
...on the North Shore, huh?
Well, la-di-fucking-da.

182
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,420
You were kind of a double kid,
I bet, right?

183
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:16,526
One kid with your old man,
one kid with your mother.

184
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,960
You're upper-middle class during the weeks,
then you're hanging...

185
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,101
...in the Southie projects
with your daddy, the fucking donkey...

186
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,760
...on the weekends. I got that right?

187
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,702
Yup.
You have different accents?

188
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,767
You did, didn't you,
you little fucking snake?

189
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:36,176
- You were like different people.
- You a psychiatrist?

190
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:39,317
If I was, I'd ask you
why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.

191
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,977
And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud
I wouldn't get an answer.

192
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:48,218
Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker
like you doing in the staties?

193
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:52,720
Well, families are always rising
or falling in America, am I right?

194
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:55,526
- Who said that?
- Hawthorne.

195
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,993
What's the matter, smart-ass,
you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?

196
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:05,338
We have a question.

197
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:11,176
Do you wanna be a cop,
or do you wanna appear to be a cop?

198
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,647
It's an honest question.

199
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:16,481
Lot of guys want to appear to be cops.
Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.

200
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,283
A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger
through a window...

201
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,256
I'm set without your
own personal job application, sergeant.

202
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,692
- What did you say?
- Sir, what do you want from me?

203
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:25,955
Hey, he can't help you.

204
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,099
I know what you are.
I know what you are...

205
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:29,632
...and I know what you're not.

206
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:33,238
I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna
help you understand something.

207
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,373
You're no fucking cop.

208
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:40,070
He's right.
We deal in deception here.

209
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:43,079
What we do not deal with
is self-deception.

210
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,082
Five years from now you could be
anything else in the world.

211
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:49,847
But you will not be
a Massachusetts state trooper.

212
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,683
- Are you sure of that?
- I'm sure of that.

213
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:53,950
Guaran-fucking-teed.

214
00:14:56,262 --> 00:15:00,858
You had 1400 on your SATs, kid.
You're an astronaut, not a statie.

215
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,963
You don't have much family.

216
00:15:05,437 --> 00:15:07,632
I don't have any family.

217
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:16,647
What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a policeman?

218
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,750
Stephanie, who was the only one
who came to my father's funeral?

219
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:23,320
- That Stephanie?
- Yeah, that Stephanie.

220
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:27,323
- Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward.
- Trying to prove something to the family?

221
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:32,487
When you say "the family,"
who do you mean exactly? You?

222
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,899
You always have to question everything,
don't you?

223
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:40,095
Maybe it would've done you some good
to have some questions from time to time.

224
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,968
"Am I an asshole?
Are my kids a mess?

225
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:47,841
Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?"
I mean, those are questions, right?

226
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:52,780
"Have I ever been good to my dying sister,
or am I just now pretending to be?"

227
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,924
Do you need some money for the funeral?

228
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,956
When my mother dies,
we don't have any more connection.

229
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:11,561
It's lovely. You get the high ceilings,
the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive.

230
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,365
The fridge has got an alarm in it
in case you have...

231
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:17,771
...eating issues, which is a joke.
Not a very funny one.

232
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:21,902
Well, there's a great view of the
State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it.

233
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:25,483
I mean, you move in,
you're upper-class by about Tuesday.

234
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,216
- So you're a cop.
- A state-police detective.

235
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,220
A state-police detective.

236
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,726
And are you a married
state-police detective?

237
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,394
No.

238
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,992
Because this is kind of a...
Sort of a big place and...

239
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,191
I have a co-signer.

240
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:48,063
Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend
to have a houseguest. That's cool. Good.

241
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,538
- Yeah, it's got...
- Just give me the papers.

242
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,172
Sure.

243
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:58,480
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon her.

244
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,175
- Amen.
- May she rest in peace. Amen.

245
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,550
May her soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed...

246
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,920
...through the mercy of God
rest in peace.

247
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,891
Amen.

248
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:34,317
So what do I do?

249
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:38,453
There's money behind this operation.
You won't be paid as a regular cop...

250
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,717
...but there's a bonus involved.

251
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:43,226
Tax-free.

252
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:49,132
We can't conceal that you were a trainee.
You'll be convicted of a crime.

253
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:53,032
We're thinking a guilty plea
to assault and battery would make sense.

254
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:54,263
Given your nature.

255
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,442
You'll do enough jail time
to convince anyone this is no setup.

256
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,134
You'll be on probation,
see a court-ordered shrink...

257
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,007
...the whole nine yards.

258
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,508
You wanna serve the Commonwealth,
this is your chance.

259
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,043
We need you, pal.

260
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:12,088
You've already pretended
to be a Costigan from South Boston.

261
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:16,216
- Every weekend, sergeant.
- Perfect.

262
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,727
Do it again.

263
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,560
For me.

264
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,804
- Hey, you Billy Costigan?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

265
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,873
Well, nothing.
I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.

266
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,374
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Connected. Not too bright.

267
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,207
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, no offense.

268
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:28,062
- Billy?
- Yeah, it's me.

269
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:31,168
- Oh, my God. Good to see you.
- Aunt Kathy, how are you?

270
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:34,328
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

271
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,673
They said you was in the staties.
I couldn't believe it.

272
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,108
I got kicked out, like, four months ago.

273
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,510
Yeah, it was in the papers.

274
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,045
So you know.

275
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,052
And why are we graced
with your presence?

276
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:53,024
I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.

277
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,320
- Look at the smile.
- My mother had them. My...

278
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,124
My mother's dead.

279
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,692
I'm sorry.
Sorry for your troubles.

280
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,429
I was at a funeral myself, man.

281
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,606
Myles Kennefick.
Knew him in school.

282
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,037
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.

283
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,374
- You remember that. What a night.
- Listen.

284
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,873
I got, like...

285
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:23,510
- Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.
- Yeah.

286
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,453
You know, after my mother passed
and everything.

287
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:29,287
In your line of work, if I gave you...

288
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:33,158
...like, what, say, 10,000,
what could I get back?

289
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,697
You know what you...

290
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,200
You know what you usually say
at these moments.

291
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:43,467
- What? What?
- Come on, man.

292
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:47,544
Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

293
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,340
What, you want me to say it?

294
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,053
I'm not a cop, all right?

295
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:00,388
- I'm your fucking cousin.
- You're bad.

296
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,353
You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.

297
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,091
Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.

298
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,795
If they knew shit,
they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

299
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:16,441
<i>R is for Ricans
P is for pigs</i>

300
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,702
Would you shut the fuck up
for five seconds, huh?

301
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,847
That's right. You used to be a cop.

302
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,449
When we're working together
just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.

303
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,076
We're not even supposed to be doing
this shit this close to Worcester.

304
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,688
This side of Worcester.

305
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:35,587
- Says who?
- Says him. Says Costello.

306
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,752
God says, as far as you're...

307
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,761
...concerned.

308
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:45,803
No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.

309
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,337
- Cunt cop.
- No, no, no.

310
00:21:48,507 --> 00:21:51,271
He talks like his shit don't stink,
but he's good people.

311
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:53,911
Well, I knew his father.

312
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:56,806
- I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
- Jackie was all right.

313
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,473
Uncle Jackie was excellent.

314
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,619
Fucking guineas.

315
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,287
- To Jackie.
- Uncle Jackie.

316
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,548
Cranberry juice.

317
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,888
It's a natural diuretic.

318
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:14,260
My girlfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.

319
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,365
What, do you got your period?

320
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:24,007
- Fucking...!
- Get off!

321
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,810
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

322
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:33,876
Do you know me?

323
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,915
No. No.

324
00:22:37,422 --> 00:22:40,289
Well, I'm the guy that tells you
there are guys you can hit...

325
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,450
...and there's guys you can't.

326
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:44,618
Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit...

327
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:47,060
...but it's almost a guy you can't hit.

328
00:22:47,232 --> 00:22:49,894
So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling
on this right now:

329
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:53,094
You don't fucking hit him.
You understand?

330
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,467
Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.

331
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:03,573
I fucking know you. I know your family.

332
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:05,708
You make one more drug deal...

333
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,717
...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours...

334
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,183
...and I'll forget your grandmother was
so nice to me.

335
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:15,451
I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
You understand that?

336
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:20,360
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

337
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:23,791
What are you drinking?

338
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,769
A cranberry juice.

339
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,239
What is it, your period?

340
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:42,515
Get him a cranberry juice.

341
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,085
Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.

342
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,927
What? "Oh," fucking what?

343
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:00,068
Get the fuck out of here.

344
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,906
Sorry I'm late.

345
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:05,008
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison
to the undercover section.

346
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,769
His undercover work is extensive.

347
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,175
He's here to give us his report.
Sergeant Dignam.

348
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,577
Okay, my people are out there.

349
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,310
They're like fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.

350
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,920
You'll hear about them
through me or Captain Queenan.

351
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,921
You will not ever know the identity
of undercover people.

352
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:23,026
Unfortunately, this shithole has more
leaks than the Iraqi navy.

353
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,459
- Fuck yourself.
- I'm tired from fucking your wife.

354
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,894
- How's your mother?
- Tired from fucking my father.

355
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:29,900
Good. Today, girls...

356
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:31,968
...what I have is microprocessors.

357
00:24:33,171 --> 00:24:36,470
Somebody, as you may already know,
stole 20 microprocessors...

358
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,201
...from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 128.

359
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,641
These are the kind
they put into computers...

360
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:44,646
...that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel...

361
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,647
...from a couple hundred miles away.

362
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,651
These pieces of plastic are worth
about 100 grand apiece.

363
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,381
We got a guy working
for the company two months...

364
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,492
...walks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday...

365
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,719
...has a ticket for Florida
on Wednesday...

366
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,262
...but on Thursday, he gets found
in a Dumpster.

367
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,593
You know where that dirtball
started his life?

368
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:04,325
Southie projects.

369
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,165
- What was his name, the departed?
- Myles Kennefick.

370
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,365
Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston...

371
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,271
- ... which happens to...
- South Boston?

372
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:15,504
Oh, you're a fucking genius.
Who forged your transcript, dickhead?

373
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,877
His old man runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.

374
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,779
We're not here to solve
the case of the missing scumbag.

375
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,388
We're here to nail Costello.

376
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,024
All right, look. We got a guy...

377
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,717
...says Costello's moving
the processors to China.

378
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:32,363
He set up the whole fucking job
and popped Kennefick.

379
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,931
You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.

380
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,536
We'd miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the Bureau.

381
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:42,434
Without asking for too many details,
do you have anyone in with Costello now?

382
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,206
Maybe. Maybe not.

383
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,072
Maybe fuck yourself.

384
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:49,577
My theory on Feds
is they're like mushrooms.

385
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,648
Feed them shit
and keep them in the dark.

386
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,443
You girls have a good day.

387
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:57,915
Normally he's a very nice guy.

388
00:25:58,089 --> 00:25:59,989
Don't judge him from this meeting alone.

389
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:06,224
Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.

390
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,127
I knew Myles.

391
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,133
He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in school.

392
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,464
I wanna get these people
who did this to him.

393
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:16,630
Would you like to help us?
You wanna help catch the people...

394
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,641
...who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him?

395
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,643
Allegedly.

396
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,809
Allegedly.

397
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:26,450
If he was killed,
he probably did something wrong.

398
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,586
But not the robbery. That's not wrong.

399
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,812
He did something else wrong?

400
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,117
Wave to your girlfriend, honey.

401
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,158
I mean, fuck yourself.

402
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,268
- Did you get that?
- "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself"?

403
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,872
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Different breed down here, sarge.

404
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:50,841
I need a cup of coffee.

405
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,853
You making a house call?

406
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,483
Have I seen you professionally?

407
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:13,153
No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.

408
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:16,994
Guys gotta use their service revolver
in the course of duty...

409
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:20,763
...and then they get to come to talk
to you about their feelings and whatnot.

410
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:24,773
No, no, I know how it goes.
You're a mental health professional.

411
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,604
I have an appointment on this floor.

412
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:30,236
Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all
frigging crazy on that floor.

413
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:32,508
- I'm one more up.
- Oh, fancy policeman.

414
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,777
- Yeah, that's right, fancy.
- Are you a statie?

415
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:38,081
Yeah, I am. I'm actually
going to law school also.

416
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:39,553
Suffolk, nights?

417
00:27:39,724 --> 00:27:42,591
Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, last time I checked.

418
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:46,253
- When's the last time you checked?
- Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

419
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:49,195
Okay, listen, I went to UMass.
I wasn't insulting you.

420
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:52,029
Well, I thought you were.
So now you gotta buy me dinner.

421
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:55,001
Maybe you can shoot someone
and then see me professionally.

422
00:27:55,173 --> 00:28:00,270
I'll stab someone in the heart with a fucking
ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.

423
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,675
That's all right. I'm a detective.
I'll find you.

424
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,873
No, sorry. I'm just joking.
I need the card. Card helps.

425
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,541
Nice to meet you, Madolyn.

426
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:21,159
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail
until I saw it.

427
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,165
No, I couldn't.
I had the other guy with me, I couldn't...

428
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:27,463
All right, it's a blue sedan
and then a white van.

429
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:30,767
It's fucked up with graffiti.
And the van is the audio surveillance.

430
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,239
All right, have a nice day.

431
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:35,240
Cut him here.

432
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:37,481
Bye-bye.

433
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,744
Jerk-ass!

434
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,583
Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore.
I cannot hold off.

435
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:49,284
Don't let me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna help you.

436
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:52,430
Come to my store next Friday.
I'll give you the money.

437
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:55,088
This is Friday, Babu.
How many times I gotta tell you?

438
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:58,292
You keep on calling me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.

439
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,698
I'm trying to help you.

440
00:28:59,871 --> 00:29:03,307
You keep telling me I'm your friend.
You don't even know my fucking name.

441
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:06,933
I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back
again like last week.

442
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:10,570
See this guy? You see this guy?
This guy don't want you to have the money.

443
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,582
Because he wants to come back there
and squash your head.

444
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,186
I have one customer sitting here.
What I'm gonna do?

445
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:19,221
Business is bad? You opened a store
in an Irish neighborhood.

446
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,620
These are dirty people.
Don't you know that?

447
00:29:21,793 --> 00:29:24,023
Sell potatoes,
I don't know what you're gonna do.

448
00:29:24,195 --> 00:29:27,289
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry.
- Know what I'm saying?

449
00:29:27,465 --> 00:29:28,989
You fellas come from Providence?

450
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,226
It isn't any of your business, is it, now?

451
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,927
What, are you fucking delivering
cannolis or something?

452
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,945
Hey! You are killing my business, man!

453
00:29:47,685 --> 00:29:48,879
Fuck!

454
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:52,216
What's wrong with this fucking country?
Everybody hates everybody!

455
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,496
Get out of here. Get out of here!

456
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:09,834
- Now, you also do probation work, right?
- That's right, I see violent offenders.

457
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:14,069
- Oh, bad guys.
- Not necessarily.

458
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:22,719
Yeah, they got this but they don't got
duck I'orange.

459
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,445
Was your meal okay?

460
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,180
Yeah, no, the lobster was good.

461
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:29,758
I just, you know, because it was
a French restaurant I was surprised.

462
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,263
I'm waiting for you to make your move.

463
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:40,370
Look, I don't know, if that thing moves,
I'm gonna shoot it.

464
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:41,903
I don't even know what it is.

465
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,012
So what's it like having people
find themselves...

466
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,048
...in your office all day long?

467
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,847
Does it get messy with all those
feelings flying around?

468
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,555
Why, does that make you
uncomfortable?

469
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:02,124
- No, no, no.
- No?

470
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:04,625
No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.

471
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,192
Well, you know what Freud said
about the Irish?

472
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,765
Yeah, I do.

473
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,099
Yeah, if you actually do,
I'll see you again.

474
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:16,905
Who says I wanna see you again?

475
00:31:20,778 --> 00:31:22,541
Don't you?

476
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,182
- You should see your face.
- Don't you?

477
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:27,784
Course I wanna see you again.

478
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:30,511
What Freud said about the Irish is...

479
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:34,954
...we're the only people who are
impervious to psychoanalysis.

480
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:38,259
- Yeah, he said that.
- I know he did.

481
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:41,592
So you're up shit's creek with a client list
full of mick cops.

482
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,757
I mean, opening up? Good luck to you.

483
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:46,096
Why do you do it, then?

484
00:31:47,305 --> 00:31:49,432
Some people do get better.

485
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:53,774
Fair enough.

486
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:57,642
Sometimes I want people to forget
their personal bullshit and do their jobs.

487
00:31:58,616 --> 00:31:59,844
Including the criminals?

488
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,282
If they don't do their jobs,
you don't have one.

489
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:06,182
I'll always have a job.
I'll just arrest innocent people.

490
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,186
- Wait. You are trouble.
- You don't know the half of it.

491
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,454
I'll arrest you right now.

492
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:15,565
<i>My word against yours.</i>

493
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:19,661
...then I see her dancing at the wedding
with you-know-who.

494
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,872
I say, "Why don't you
go to Parents Without Partners?"

495
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:27,068
He goes, "Ma, they're all losers
at the Parents Without Partners," so...

496
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,147
So I say to him,
"Princess Carolina of Monaco..."

497
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,183
Schuyler.

498
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:52,165
Do you know who I am?

499
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:56,930
No.

500
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:05,279
You met my friend Mr. French
the other night.

501
00:33:15,426 --> 00:33:17,951
His real name Mr. French?

502
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:22,526
No.

503
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,105
Come with me.

504
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:36,909
I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.

505
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:43,579
You know something, they just do not stop
having the Mafia in Providence.

506
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:47,623
And this can cause me a lot of problems.

507
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,531
Those guys you tuned up...

508
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,862
...they're connected down Providence.

509
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,770
What they're gonna do...

510
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:05,534
...is come back with some guys
and kill you.

511
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,736
Which, sure as you're born,
they will do.

512
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:11,313
Unless I stop them.

513
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,550
Do you want me to stop them?

514
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:18,917
Is this something I can't do personally?

515
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,591
I'm gonna have my associate search you.

516
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:27,060
No one's searching me.
Search me for what?

517
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,961
Contra-fucking-band.
Take your shoes off.

518
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,002
Shoes.

519
00:34:38,643 --> 00:34:40,133
I knew your father.

520
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,444
Yeah? Do you know he's dead?

521
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:50,287
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?

522
00:34:51,055 --> 00:34:54,115
- Stand.
- He didn't complain.

523
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:57,022
Yeah, that was his problem.

524
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,027
Who said he had a problem?

525
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,857
I just said he had a fucking problem.

526
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:07,501
There's a man could've been anything.

527
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:10,072
Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?

528
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:13,677
- Fuck.
- I'm saying he worked at the airport.

529
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,710
- He's clean.
- Arm.

530
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,142
Yeah, come on.

531
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:18,839
What arm? What fucking arm?

532
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:22,349
Show me your arm. Flip it.

533
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,687
Makes me curious to see you
in this neighborhood.

534
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,763
He's clean.

535
00:35:35,933 --> 00:35:39,198
And if I can slander my own
environment...

536
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:43,170
...it makes me sad, this regression.

537
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:48,301
Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some
fucking cop prick like Queenan...

538
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:52,779
...to pull you out of the staties
and send you after me.

539
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,884
I just can't know.

540
00:35:56,354 --> 00:36:00,552
I don't know what they do
in that particular department, anyway.

541
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,953
- Are you still a cop?
- No! No!

542
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,465
Swear on your mother's grave
you're still not a cop?

543
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,466
I am not a fucking cop!

544
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:17,306
Are you gonna stop doing coke deals
with your jerkoff fucking cousin?

545
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:20,603
Yes. Yes, yes.

546
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,806
All right, all right, all right.

547
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,779
You're okay. You'll be all right.

548
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:30,185
Get your hand taken care of.

549
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:35,817
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.

550
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:40,723
As for our problem with Providence...

551
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:44,364
...let's not cry over spilled guineas.

552
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:49,873
Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar?

553
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,477
Just kidding. How's your mother?

554
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,883
She's on her way out.

555
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,111
We all are. Act accordingly.

556
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,651
Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.

557
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:07,984
Get in the car.
I wanna show you something.

558
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:11,253
- What's got you all hot and bothered?
- Get in the car. You'll see.

559
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,757
Do you trust him?

560
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,627
Well, these days...

561
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,926
...who's reliable?

562
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,438
His Uncle Jackie was.

563
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:26,599
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy
acts like he's got nothing to lose.

564
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,246
I'm reliable.

565
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:37,487
Arnold, you're one in a million.

566
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:40,317
Ten. Ten million.

567
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,956
What about your wife, Arnold?

568
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:49,023
Well, I thought she was.

569
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:52,298
She wasn't.

570
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,470
Well, she got reliable.

571
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,602
Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?

572
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,805
Another county heard from.

573
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:06,711
One too many. She got a big mouth.

574
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,977
Answer this for me, will you?

575
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,368
The principles of detection tell me
these two gentlemen came from Providence.

576
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:37,241
Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd
appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.

577
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,179
Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene,
but knock yourself out.

578
00:38:40,351 --> 00:38:41,818
Thanks.

579
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:48,316
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having
posttraumatic stress.

580
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,289
Can I meet you for lunch?

581
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,723
All right, see you then.

582
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,930
Who's the lead detective?

583
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,935
Good. He's a lox.

584
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,176
Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas
for the hit. He had nothing to do with it...

585
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,080
<i>...and he'll say so.</i>

586
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:19,552
Look in his car, you'll find the gun
that did it, registered, official. Providence.

587
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:21,919
In the trunk or the glove compartment?

588
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:25,252
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?

589
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:33,196
Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby
on the 6:00 news.

590
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,668
No wonder you get ahead.

591
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,903
Have a seat, Bill.

592
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,055
Do you know John Lennon?

593
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:57,218
Yeah, sure, he was the president
before Lincoln.

594
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:01,891
Lennon said:

595
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:04,328
"I'm an artist.

596
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:08,905
You give me a fucking tuba,
I'll get you something out of it."

597
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:14,508
I tell you, Mr. Costello...

598
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:17,943
...I'd like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it.

599
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,721
Smart-mouth.

600
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,559
Too bad.

601
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,060
If you'll indulge me...

602
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:36,955
Now what?

603
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,436
Choir practice.

604
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,803
Choir practice...

605
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:50,079
The point I'm making
with John Lennon is...

606
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:54,981
...a man could look at anything...

607
00:40:55,186 --> 00:40:56,813
...and make something out of it.

608
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,454
For instance...

609
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:01,022
...I look at you and I think:

610
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:04,359
What could I use you for?

611
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:08,358
Get rid of this.

612
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:10,022
French.

613
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,669
<i>Put it downstairs. Here.
Go ahead, thank you.</i>

614
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:14,532
Maybe we could work something out.

615
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:18,671
- Good.
- And send this to his wife.

616
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,811
It was nice the way
you asked the guy...

617
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,208
...which hand he jerked off with.

618
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:25,315
I hope this don't shake Rita up.

619
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,151
As I remember,
she ain't that sentimental.

620
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:40,025
That was quick.
You think he's dead already?

621
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,890
<i>We have to do it by phone.
I won't do it...</i>

622
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,331
...if I have to wear a wire.
No wires. Understand?

623
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,903
<i>- You don't know what this is like.
- Microprocessors.</i>

624
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,370
<i>- Micro what?
- Microprocessors.</i>

625
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:53,408
We'll probably be at war
with the Chinese in 20-odd years...

626
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:56,512
...and Costello is selling them
military technology.

627
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,080
Microprocessors, chips, computer parts.

628
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:01,514
<i>Anybody says anything about
anything like that...</i>

629
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,674
...you let us know.

630
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,852
So who did the two guys
from Providence?

631
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,523
Jimmy Pappas.

632
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,686
What happened to Jimmy Pappas?

633
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:17,160
Jimmy had a rough month.

634
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,665
Jimmy had a heart attack in jail...

635
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:23,034
...and then he got himself knifed
at Boston City Hospital.

636
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,038
I believe it's been in the papers.

637
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,244
You seem quite happy with that result.

638
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,407
It's a fucking result.

639
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:34,847
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?

640
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:38,045
Cui gives a shit?
It's got a frigging bow on it.

641
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,290
I think you are a cop, my son.

642
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:46,622
- Where's your license?
- What license?

643
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,732
I don't see none. There's no such thing
as a license, of course.

644
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,028
But you, you definitely need
to have fucking one.

645
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:56,604
If you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone else.

646
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:59,299
That means you're bringing
undesirable elements...

647
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,410
...into Mr. Costello's area.

648
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:09,344
I was going for my fucking cigarettes!

649
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,544
Hey.

650
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:13,820
That's Jimmy Bags.

651
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,725
- He was rea... I don't know.
- What the fuck you doing?

652
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:23,526
I'm in the hole,
I pay him two grand.

653
00:43:23,701 --> 00:43:25,498
There's no profit, I pay him two grand.

654
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:27,569
Then make more money.
This is America.

655
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:31,037
You don't make money, you're
a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?

656
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,836
- Make more money.
- That's the spirit!

657
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:36,104
- Oh, fuck.
- Don't worry about it.

658
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,805
The guy don't need
any fucking teeth anyway.

659
00:43:39,016 --> 00:43:42,110
It's a small surveillance subunit,
but it's mine.

660
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:45,153
I didn't take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up.

661
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:49,554
I handpicked this group.
You're my A team. Now, our prim...

662
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:51,453
Hi, Captain.

663
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,823
This crazy fuck...

664
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,124
- ... knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
- So?

665
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,392
- He was...
- He was reaching for his cigarettes.

666
00:43:57,568 --> 00:44:00,401
You're gonna give me shit?
It wasn't for no reason, Frank.

667
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:01,833
He reached into his coat.

668
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,236
I don't know if he's a bookie
or what he's doing.

669
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:06,842
Well, you do know
what a bookie does, don't you?

670
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,070
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.

671
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,510
Queenan's compartmentalizing
everything in SIU...

672
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:13,013
...which is the right thing.

673
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:15,811
I don't trust half the troopers
out there anymore.

674
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,220
Bottom line...

675
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,482
...we think we might have a problem.

676
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,525
We think Costello's got a rat
in the state police.

677
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:27,595
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

678
00:44:27,765 --> 00:44:30,063
Do we have direct access
to Queenan's undercovers?

679
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:32,828
No, no, not presently.

680
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,436
But I'm working on that.

681
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:36,732
Here, Bill, this is for you.

682
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:41,037
From now on, call the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.

683
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:44,703
You ask for Mikey
because there is no Mikey.

684
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:47,780
You wait. We'll call you.

685
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:49,612
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got that.

686
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:52,722
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- I got that.

687
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:54,517
Good.

688
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,891
Hi, Dad.

689
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:00,859
I got promoted. All right.

690
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,383
Excuse me for one second.

691
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:23,282
You know...

692
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,921
...if your father were alive...

693
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,150
...and saw you here sitting with me...

694
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:31,590
...let's say he'd have a word with me
about this.

695
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:34,560
In fact, he'd kill seven guys
just to cut my throat.

696
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:36,962
And he could do it...

697
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,436
...which is maybe something
you don't know about William Costigan Sr.

698
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:50,806
- So he never...? I mean, never?
- No. No, no.

699
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:54,473
He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.

700
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,949
You can't do anything
with a man like that.

701
00:45:58,021 --> 00:45:59,648
Your Uncle Jackie...

702
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:04,590
...he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you.

703
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,191
And I think about this.

704
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,801
So what the fuck
are we talking about here?

705
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,510
Did you ever think about
going back to school?

706
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,703
School?

707
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,446
With all due respect, Mr. Costello...

708
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,712
...school is out.

709
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:34,219
Maybe someday
you'll wake the fuck up.

710
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:37,288
Good day, Fathers.

711
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:41,464
- Mr. Costello.
- Good morning, Francis, good morning.

712
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,294
You recall our chat?

713
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,694
Little boys...

714
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:51,301
...sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth...

715
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:54,309
"I am as God made me."
Was that your rationale?

716
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:01,716
May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.

717
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:05,912
May I remind you
that pride comes before the fall.

718
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:11,394
How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?

719
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:14,963
We had a tasty relationship
before she took her vows.

720
00:47:15,766 --> 00:47:17,927
Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.

721
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:19,796
Pay them.

722
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:24,165
Get the old bombardier a drink
on the house.

723
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:34,109
- What do you got for me?
- Uniform clipped him for suspended license.

724
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:36,650
However, he's a subject of
an open investigation...

725
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,754
More than one. He's one of Costello's.

726
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:41,482
We're getting a warrant.
Can't get an address off him.

727
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:44,320
He paged his lawyer but
the lawyer hasn't called back yet.

728
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,122
- Who's the lawyer?
- Didn't know the name. Just a number.

729
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,264
Beeper number.

730
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,265
- And the guy didn't show up?
- No.

731
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:55,635
- And he beeped him?
- Twice.

732
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:02,345
Give me your phone. Turn that off.

733
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,639
- What?
- Turn the fucking camera off.

734
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:08,242
Give it to me. He doesn't know
what the fucking lawyer looks like.

735
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:10,477
Whose briefcase is this? All right.

736
00:48:10,654 --> 00:48:11,916
- It's off?
- You're good.

737
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:14,751
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.

738
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,253
- He can't do that.
- He just did.

739
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:20,885
- You my attorney?
- What do you think?

740
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,056
Have you made statements
or phone calls...

741
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,895
...I need to be made aware of?

742
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:30,599
I beeped you.

743
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:33,901
The card they gave me. That's it.

744
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:37,478
- That's it?
- That's it.

745
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,117
You need to call your mother...

746
00:48:42,286 --> 00:48:44,584
...tell her you're not gonna be home
for supper.

747
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:52,820
Camera's off.
It's off. Call your mother.

748
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:59,432
Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid
right now.

749
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:03,197
I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.

750
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:06,732
So make the call.

751
00:49:11,381 --> 00:49:14,839
Lookit, fuckstick,
you don't gotta trust me...

752
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:18,915
...just listen to what I'm saying to you.

753
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:40,200
Mom, I'm not gonna make it home
for supper.

754
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:42,311
<i>Sorry, yeah, I got held up.</i>

755
00:49:43,847 --> 00:49:46,782
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

756
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:51,049
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

757
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:52,984
Bye.

758
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:56,387
Everybody out. Move.

759
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:14,738
Thank you.

760
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:17,479
So who are you?

761
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:21,083
I think you need a different attorney,
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.

762
00:50:21,251 --> 00:50:22,912
So when the fuck am I gonna get out?

763
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:26,419
All right, run the last number he called.
That's his house.

764
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:29,286
I'll swear to the judge
I surveilled him there...

765
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:31,552
...and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.

766
00:50:31,728 --> 00:50:35,095
- Why did you use my phone?
- Because you didn't go in there.

767
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,074
The light's nice here in the morning.

768
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,678
So do you wanna talk about last night?

769
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:05,852
You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make
too big a deal out of it.

770
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:13,369
It's actually quite common.

771
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,129
I gotta go to work.

772
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,178
Do you lie?

773
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,075
Why? Do you?

774
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,948
No, I'm asking if you lie.

775
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:35,423
Honesty is not synonymous with truth.

776
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,685
Yeah, you lie.

777
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:39,021
You lie.

778
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,854
Is it to do some good,
to get somewhere personally...

779
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:44,091
...or, what, just for the fuck of it?

780
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:49,694
Well, I expect that some people do it
to keep things on an even keel.

781
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:55,134
So you had a parent who was a drunk.

782
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:00,744
Did you?

783
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:02,544
No.

784
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:06,618
Let's keep it with you.

785
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,384
Talk about how you feel.

786
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:13,492
<i>How I feel.</i>

787
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,563
<i>How I feel.</i>

788
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:38,148
- Fuck.
- Brian, stop it.

789
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:46,361
No. Please. No.

790
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,327
Ain't gonna hurt you.

791
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,166
<i>You sit there...</i>

792
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,566
...with a mass murderer.

793
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:57,534
A mass murderer.

794
00:52:57,707 --> 00:53:00,904
Your heart rate is jacked.

795
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:03,707
And your hand...

796
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:06,781
...steady.

797
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:13,486
That's one thing I figured out about myself
in prison. My hand...

798
00:53:13,657 --> 00:53:15,852
...does not shake.

799
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:18,150
Ever.

800
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:29,130
Wake the fuck up.

801
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:33,599
There was a cop leaving when I came in.

802
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,978
How did you know he was a cop?

803
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:40,947
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight,
you know, air of scumbag entitlement.

804
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:43,278
- Do you see cops?
- That's part of what I do.

805
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:46,650
I normally don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.

806
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:50,054
Oh, boy.
You should get a better job, huh?

807
00:53:50,927 --> 00:53:52,588
Should I?

808
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:56,229
So do they all come in here...

809
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,629
...and cry, your cops?

810
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:02,104
Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.

811
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:05,469
If they've had trouble at home,
if they've had to use their weapons...

812
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:07,769
Use their weapons?

813
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:09,778
Let me tell you something.

814
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:12,244
They signed up to use their weapons.

815
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,883
Most of them, all right.
But they watch enough TV...

816
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:17,952
...so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

817
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:21,147
There is no one more full of shit
than a cop.

818
00:54:21,324 --> 00:54:23,121
Except for a cop on TV.

819
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:32,467
<i>I looked at your file.</i>

820
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,163
I see that you have a record of assault.

821
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:37,863
Yeah.

822
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:40,166
<i>So what was it like for you in jail?</i>

823
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:44,809
What, you wanna hear about the showers?
Is that what you wanna hear about?

824
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:46,812
Did something happen to you?

825
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,616
No.

826
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:55,280
- Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them.
- Hey, you think you can pop somebody...

827
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:58,859
...and there's a special card to play?
Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...

828
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:01,930
...happens to work undercover
for the Boston Police Department.

829
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:04,464
I'm going nuts.
I can't be someone else every day.

830
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,226
It's been a year. I've had enough!

831
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:09,531
Calm down. Most people do it every day.
What's the big deal?

832
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:12,834
- Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?
- Exactly.

833
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:15,375
You're nobody.
You signed the papers, remember?

834
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:19,106
We're the only two people on this earth
that even know you're a cop.

835
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:21,307
How about we just erase your file, huh?

836
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:23,247
How about we erase your file...

837
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,854
...and you're just
another soldier for Costello...

838
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:29,253
...open to arrest for I don't know
how many felonies. What do you say?

839
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:33,021
How about I fucking kill you, huh?
How about I fucking kill you!

840
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,323
- That was a joke. Come on.
- That wasn't a joke.

841
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,728
You play a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...

842
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:43,271
- ... you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!
- Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!

843
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,342
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!

844
00:55:48,111 --> 00:55:50,204
For chrissake, be smart.

845
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,679
If anybody's watching us now,
how are we not supposed to arrest you?

846
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,408
Come on, get in the car.

847
00:55:55,585 --> 00:55:57,951
Both of you, get in the car.

848
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:01,918
When are you gonna take Costello?

849
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,219
What's wrong with taking him
on any one...

850
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:07,693
...of the million felonies that
you've seen him do or I've seen him do?

851
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,559
I mean, he murdered somebody, right?

852
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,668
The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him!

853
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:16,533
What are you waiting for? Do you want him
to chop me up and feed me to the poor?

854
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:18,401
- That what you want?
- That'd stick.

855
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,338
Will you shut up?

856
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:22,876
We are building a case and it takes time.

857
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,274
You know that.

858
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:27,447
Something's wrong.

859
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,049
I'm telling you, something's wrong.

860
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,647
Yeah, maybe.

861
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,954
Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, all right?

862
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,123
No bullshit.

863
00:56:39,662 --> 00:56:42,825
I think Costello's got a spy inside
the Special Investigation Unit.

864
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,259
You serious?

865
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:49,234
I'm afraid so.

866
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,803
Have you heard anything like that?

867
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,640
Jesus Christ.

868
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,680
Hang tight for me, kid.

869
00:57:01,851 --> 00:57:03,648
Just a little while longer.

870
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,118
We are this close:

871
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,920
All right?

872
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:12,956
<i>What do you expect coming in here?</i>

873
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:15,927
- I have to come here.
- I know you have to come here.

874
00:57:16,499 --> 00:57:19,024
But now that you're here...

875
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:21,099
...what do you want?

876
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:22,937
You want the truth?

877
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:26,799
Valium.

878
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:30,271
If you lied, you would have an easier time
getting what you wanted.

879
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:33,848
- What's that say about what you do?
- We should have a few more meetings...

880
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:37,714
- ... before we even talk about prescriptions.
- Look, I'm having panic attacks.

881
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:42,221
Other night, I thought I was having a heart
attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over.

882
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:43,984
I haven't slept for fucking weeks.

883
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,684
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

884
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:48,558
I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking pills...

885
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:50,562
...and you're gonna close my file?

886
00:57:50,733 --> 00:57:54,362
- I didn't say I'd close your file. No, I...
- I thought I was supposed to tell...

887
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:57,131
- ... the truth here, if only fucking here.
- You are! Yes.

888
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:01,437
A guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy, of self-reliance that he has...

889
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:02,600
...and what do you do?

890
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:06,840
What do you do? You send him off on the
street to score smack? Is that what you do?

891
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:09,749
You're fucking ridiculous.

892
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:19,324
Two pills?

893
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:22,357
Why don't you just give me
a bottle of Scotch...

894
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:24,693
...and a handgun
to blow my fucking head off?

895
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:27,860
- Are we done with this psychiatry bullshit?
- You can leave!

896
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:30,437
What did I just put myself through?
I'm out of here.

897
00:58:30,607 --> 00:58:35,044
And what if that was a legitimate threat?
Think about it, fucking hotshot.

898
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,039
<i>Fuck.</i>

899
00:58:46,756 --> 00:58:49,418
Why is the last patient of the day
always the hardest one?

900
00:58:49,592 --> 00:58:51,389
You're tired and you don't give a shit.

901
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:53,461
- It's not supernatural.
- Listen.

902
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:58,727
Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody
that you have to see or they put you in jail.

903
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:01,769
Okay? I mean, if you're in distress,
I will help you.

904
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:05,364
What's this?

905
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:08,675
It's my card. And a prescription
for 20 lorazepam.

906
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:10,403
Yeah?

907
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,207
Is it enough to commit suicide?

908
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:15,273
Maybe it is. All right? Okay?

909
00:59:15,451 --> 00:59:17,612
Have I done my job
up to your goddamn standards?

910
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:21,518
Because according to my standards,
you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.

911
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:25,320
You know, and too damn bad if you
don't like my initial clinical reaction.

912
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:26,757
Thank you.

913
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:30,557
I'm transferring you to another counselor.

914
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,724
- Good.
- Okay.

915
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:36,463
So you wanna get a cup of coffee?

916
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:46,180
Bring it in here, please.
Would somebody bring it in?

917
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:47,714
Come on in.

918
00:59:48,818 --> 00:59:52,811
Our target is a major transaction
of microprocessors.

919
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:54,581
Yes, those.

920
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:58,488
I don't know what they are, you don't know
what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.

921
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:01,186
Lots of cash is gonna change hands
inside a building...

922
01:00:01,364 --> 01:00:03,628
...that we have
under AV surveillance close-by.

923
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:07,394
I know this location is not the best,
but we had very little time to set up.

924
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:09,435
- You guys know anything about this?
- No.

925
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,666
Sullivan's team will ID the bad guys
and listen in on the phones.

926
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:14,207
Our unit will not take action.

927
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:18,712
I repeat, not take action, until a man
that Captain Queenan has inside...

928
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:21,076
...verifies the transaction. Are we clear?

929
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:25,209
Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.

930
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:28,990
We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight...

931
01:00:29,158 --> 01:00:31,683
...we are going to get him.
Let's go to work.

932
01:00:31,861 --> 01:00:34,625
All right, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.

933
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:37,129
Sorry to get you last-minute,
but things leak.

934
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,325
This lead came from
Queenan's undercover guy.

935
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:44,064
I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of
those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.

936
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:51,305
- Hi, Dad?
- Yes.

937
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,642
<i>Yeah, something big came up at work.</i>

938
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,307
<i>- I'm not gonna be home for supper.
- Too bad.</i>

939
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,053
Your mother worked all goddamn day.

940
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:02,722
We'll just have to sit down without you
and your friends.

941
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:05,053
Oh, no, my friends are still coming.

942
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:11,364
So we'll just... I'll just see you
for lunch instead tomorrow.

943
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,031
Your mother will be proud.

944
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:16,068
All right, thanks, Pop. Bye.

945
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:18,863
The readiness is all.

946
01:01:19,642 --> 01:01:23,510
You know the players. Call the game.

947
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:26,441
Thank you.

948
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,618
- You ready?
- Is your highness...

949
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:32,949
...gonna drop me off at confession
before work, or fuck me, or what?

950
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:35,852
What have you got to confess
to that anointed pederast?

951
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,960
A confessional seal, these days...

952
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:40,755
...I'm not so sure.

953
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:48,465
He'll operate the cameras.
You ID the guys and log them.

954
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,135
All cellphone signals
are under surveillance...

955
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:54,071
...through the courtesy of
our federal friends over there.

956
01:01:56,579 --> 01:02:00,379
Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

957
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:04,746
Keep an eye on this one.

958
01:02:39,956 --> 01:02:42,186
All right, here we go.

959
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:47,159
There's Costello. Mr. French.

960
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,159
There's Fitzy, Delahunt...

961
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:51,363
...and the new guy, Billy Costigan.

962
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,408
Time is 10:46.

963
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:04,537
All right, turn off your cellphones.

964
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:07,706
Fitzy's got the chicken.
Check your weapons.

965
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:33,499
- We have a blind spot.
- Why do we have a blind spot?

966
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:35,576
We had two hours' notice. Two hours.

967
01:03:35,745 --> 01:03:38,475
- Fuck you think this is, NASA?
- It never crossed my mind.

968
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,708
- Have you got a camera in the back?
- What back?

969
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:51,085
- How you going, Robert?
- Good, Mr. Costello.

970
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:55,123
I wanna tell you, at least two
of these gents have machine guns.

971
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,370
He's from the Chinese government.
He's scared shitless.

972
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:14,681
Government man. Scared.

973
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:18,781
I'm concerned about a Chinaman
who thinks it's wise...

974
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:22,356
...to come to a business transaction...

975
01:04:22,658 --> 01:04:24,421
...with automatic weapons.

976
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:34,236
For his own good, tell Bruce Lee
and the Karate Kids...

977
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:37,031
...none of us are carrying
automatic weapons.

978
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:40,505
Because here, in this country...

979
01:04:40,943 --> 01:04:43,468
...it don't add inches to your dick.

980
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:45,841
You get a life sentence for it.

981
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:06,767
If we had some Homeland Security money
like some douche bags I could mention...

982
01:05:06,936 --> 01:05:09,097
- Any calls?
- They turned off their cellphones.

983
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,800
Search randomly for calls
made from the area.

984
01:05:11,974 --> 01:05:14,374
Eight hundred and seven phones
are live in this area.

985
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:16,010
Then narrow the area.

986
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:18,738
What you see there for service
is what you're gonna get.

987
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,815
Why did they turn their phones off?

988
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:23,952
- Wait. There's still one phone up.
- Where?

989
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:37,997
The buyers are there.

990
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:45,038
You know, direct contact with your guys
would have its advantages.

991
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:46,697
Not to my guy.

992
01:05:47,243 --> 01:05:49,973
This is unbelievable.
Who put the cameras in this place?

993
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:51,608
Oh, who the fuck are you?

994
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:55,276
I'm the guy who does his job.
You must be the other guy.

995
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:01,754
If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan
any time in this century...

996
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:06,190
...they'd better shape up
and show me 1 million dollars.

997
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:14,770
What we generally do, in this country...

998
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:17,067
...is one guy...

999
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:19,432
...brings the items...

1000
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:21,906
...and the other guy...

1001
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:23,508
...pays him.

1002
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:29,308
No "tickee"...

1003
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:32,149
...no laundry.

1004
01:06:40,596 --> 01:06:42,689
Go ahead, Fitz.

1005
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:01,806
Cars are moving,
but did you see anybody come out?

1006
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,578
Please tell me those cars aren't empty.

1007
01:07:05,755 --> 01:07:10,818
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me
that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty!

1008
01:07:15,398 --> 01:07:18,333
They didn't figure we had a navy.

1009
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,403
Did you put a camera in the back?

1010
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:30,340
Can I talk to you for a second, please?

1011
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:34,911
You stupid fucking hard-on!

1012
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:37,275
You fucked this whole thing up!

1013
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:40,718
What the fuck did you do,
you cocksucker? Let go of me!

1014
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:44,155
I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off
and shove it up your fucking ass!

1015
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:46,688
Why don't we meet?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

1016
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:49,092
<i>I'm getting on a plane
unless you put Queenan on.</i>

1017
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:52,257
Queenan had a funeral to go to.
This is my shift. Calm down.

1018
01:07:52,435 --> 01:07:54,460
Why shouldn't I get
on a fucking plane, huh?

1019
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:57,265
Meet up? You actually want me dead?

1020
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:00,273
Look, there is a rat in your unit.
That is a fact, all right?

1021
01:08:00,443 --> 01:08:01,910
<i>- Where's Queenan?
- He's not here.</i>

1022
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:05,138
They knew you had cameras in the building.
They knew everything.

1023
01:08:05,314 --> 01:08:08,477
There is a leak from the inside.
It's real. Man, smoke him out.

1024
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:12,678
Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who-
Didn't-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?

1025
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:16,382
Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have
a sealed wiretap warrant...

1026
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:21,019
...for Costello's apartment. Don't tell
anyone in our division, but tell SIU.

1027
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:23,665
Flush it down the pipe,
see if it comes out on my end.

1028
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:25,698
That's what we do first. Narrow it down.

1029
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:28,928
<i>- Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?
- He's not here.</i>

1030
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:32,199
You wanna meet up
or you got something real, call me back.

1031
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:41,377
...changing your life radically.

1032
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:43,950
Change anything. Right?
Change everything.

1033
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,145
- Right?
- Yeah.

1034
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:51,424
How long you been with this guy?

1035
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:54,889
- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.

1036
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,797
- Four months. Almost four months.
- Four months.

1037
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,494
Do you love him?

1038
01:09:04,673 --> 01:09:07,141
It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah.

1039
01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:08,674
It's very serious.

1040
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:12,541
Is he a headcase like me?
I'm just curious.

1041
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,174
No more than I am.

1042
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,809
I know that it's a serious relationship.

1043
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:20,684
I know there are ups and downs. Right?

1044
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:23,188
People have doubts and problems.

1045
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:27,322
Well, not problems, but doubts.

1046
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:33,831
What would you do if he was standing
right there and he saw us?

1047
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,208
I would lie. Yeah, I would lie.

1048
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:45,905
You know, to keep things
on an even keel, right?

1049
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:48,174
Right? We talked about that.

1050
01:09:53,722 --> 01:09:55,690
- Morning.
- Good morning.

1051
01:09:56,258 --> 01:09:58,283
Want a French doughnut?

1052
01:09:58,794 --> 01:10:00,261
Yeah.

1053
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:03,289
- Hey, can I lookit?
- Yeah.

1054
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:04,927
Sure.

1055
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:10,198
- All right, we're not having this out.
- What?

1056
01:10:10,372 --> 01:10:12,533
You don't see any pictures
of where I came from.

1057
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:14,475
Look, I respect who you are...

1058
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:16,804
...just, you know, not in the living room.

1059
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:18,571
We might have company.

1060
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:20,738
- Company?
- Yeah, company.

1061
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:24,884
- Hey, now, why do you work for the state?
- Why not? You do.

1062
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:28,751
No, what you do. The degrees and all,
everything you got. You're hot shit.

1063
01:10:29,124 --> 01:10:30,113
Yeah?

1064
01:10:30,292 --> 01:10:33,227
So why do you make as much
as a guidance counselor?

1065
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:36,922
Because I believe in public service.

1066
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:42,068
So now you're gonna fuck with me?
So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh?

1067
01:10:42,838 --> 01:10:45,306
- No, don't start with me. Don't...
- Hey.

1068
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,601
Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it!

1069
01:10:48,777 --> 01:10:50,472
- The phone.
- Forget the phone.

1070
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:52,113
Get it. Answer it. Answer it.

1071
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:54,508
This is your first phone call
in the new house.

1072
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:56,878
You live here now. You're a resident.

1073
01:10:58,854 --> 01:11:00,583
Mayor Sullivan's office.

1074
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:03,554
<i>Put Colin on the phone right now.</i>

1075
01:11:04,026 --> 01:11:05,323
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

1076
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:07,018
What?

1077
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,623
I think it's a guy with...

1078
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:13,791
- It's like a cancer guy.
- Hello.

1079
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:17,132
What the fuck is it
with you and your phone, huh?

1080
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:20,339
Something for work.

1081
01:11:20,509 --> 01:11:24,377
Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It went dead. I don't know, I get...

1082
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:26,844
Was that that shrink cunt
that answered the phone?

1083
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:29,644
Remember I told you that we were...
She was gonna move in?

1084
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:31,513
<i>- Yeah.
- She moved in.</i>

1085
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:35,418
- You better get organized, quick.
- Last time I checked, I tipped you off...

1086
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:37,422
...and you're not in jail.

1087
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:40,994
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

1088
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:44,894
Do you like Little Miss Thing
sucking on your cock?

1089
01:11:47,603 --> 01:11:48,968
Yes. Yes, I do.

1090
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,765
So earn it.

1091
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,699
I'm getting the feeling...

1092
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:55,776
...we got a cop in my crew.

1093
01:11:56,078 --> 01:11:58,478
Yeah, I know,
I'm kind of getting that feeling too.

1094
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:01,445
He's one of yours. Inside.

1095
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:02,709
<i>Have you seen anything?</i>

1096
01:12:02,885 --> 01:12:06,480
I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.

1097
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,849
<i>- Doing my best.
- Your best?</i>

1098
01:12:08,023 --> 01:12:10,890
What do you think we're in,
the fucking haberdashery business?

1099
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:12,618
Look, Frank, if you don't relax...

1100
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:16,663
If you don't relax, I can't relax. All right?
Now, what I need you to do...

1101
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:20,290
<i>...get me information on the people
with you last night. Your crew.</i>

1102
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:22,403
Get me social-security numbers, get me...

1103
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:26,735
Get you? Give you?
Who the fuck do you work for?

1104
01:12:26,909 --> 01:12:30,174
All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank.
All right. I'm sorry.

1105
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:33,543
If you could, please.
What I need are SS numbers, DOBs...

1106
01:12:33,716 --> 01:12:38,244
...just all the pedigree information so I can
run it on my end and we can ID the prick.

1107
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:40,217
<i>If you can get me that information...</i>

1108
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:42,823
...I can... We're gonna handle it.
I can handle it.

1109
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:45,186
Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants.

1110
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,090
<i>I'll get you the records and whatnot.</i>

1111
01:12:47,262 --> 01:12:50,425
<i>But listen to me, son.
Don't disappoint me on this...</i>

1112
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:53,898
...or some other guy will be putting
their fat cock...

1113
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:56,560
...up Little Miss Freud's ass.

1114
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,745
How are you, Francis?

1115
01:13:10,919 --> 01:13:14,411
- My mother called me Francis.
- I know she did.

1116
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:17,388
And your father called you the tumor.

1117
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:20,221
And what did your father
call you, Charlie?

1118
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:24,389
Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasn't around.

1119
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:26,693
You have a boss
that has a laryngectomy?

1120
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:30,771
No, no, no. That was a guy
who works for me.

1121
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:32,930
You're lying to me.

1122
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,075
Not exactly.

1123
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:39,703
What did you do with
the real microprocessors, Frank?

1124
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:42,845
Microprocessors.

1125
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:44,580
Oh, yeah.

1126
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:47,916
I heard the story. You arrested
some Chinese government guys...

1127
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:51,423
...at the border carrying some light sockets
or something.

1128
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:55,961
I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk
off of your face.

1129
01:13:56,632 --> 01:13:59,294
Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?

1130
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:03,427
There are certain parts of my job that
I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about.

1131
01:14:03,806 --> 01:14:08,573
And I cannot allow you to jeopardize
an ongoing investigation...

1132
01:14:08,744 --> 01:14:10,769
...or your life.

1133
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:14,739
No, really, there are things
you don't even wanna know about.

1134
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:17,113
Okay, then just say that.

1135
01:14:19,201 --> 01:14:20,566
All right, I will.

1136
01:14:21,203 --> 01:14:23,364
Oh, that's the movers.

1137
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:25,302
Yeah, you still wanna stay?

1138
01:14:26,275 --> 01:14:28,436
- Yes.
- Yeah?

1139
01:14:28,611 --> 01:14:32,240
Come on, I'm coming!
It's the worst timing.

1140
01:14:32,682 --> 01:14:34,650
I'm gonna get you.

1141
01:14:35,851 --> 01:14:38,684
If you could've, you would've.

1142
01:14:38,955 --> 01:14:42,516
But I guess you like to go
at your own pace.

1143
01:14:42,692 --> 01:14:47,061
Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.

1144
01:14:55,104 --> 01:14:56,093
<i>Frankie.</i>

1145
01:14:57,039 --> 01:14:58,506
<i>Frankie!</i>

1146
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:01,468
<i>Your mother forgives me.</i>

1147
01:15:06,248 --> 01:15:08,113
You take off an armored car at the mall.

1148
01:15:08,284 --> 01:15:10,309
What the fuck,
you pay guineas in Providence?

1149
01:15:10,486 --> 01:15:13,319
- Fucking now I do!
- What the fuck do you do?

1150
01:15:13,489 --> 01:15:17,892
I gotta pay Costello for him to trade me
to the FBI? Because that's what he does.

1151
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:20,551
FBI? What the fuck
you talking about, FBI?

1152
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,524
My God, is that French out there?

1153
01:15:25,701 --> 01:15:27,862
What the fuck did you just say
about the FBI?

1154
01:15:28,037 --> 01:15:29,971
Forget what I said. I'm fucking high.

1155
01:15:30,639 --> 01:15:33,130
Whatever may be going on
in that very fucking poor...

1156
01:15:33,309 --> 01:15:37,075
...very limited brain of yours,
I am not gonna hurt you, all right?

1157
01:15:37,346 --> 01:15:39,507
- Just tell me what you fucking said.
- Forget it.

1158
01:15:39,682 --> 01:15:43,584
I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high.
I'd never say what you thought I said.

1159
01:15:44,420 --> 01:15:45,409
Fuck!

1160
01:15:45,588 --> 01:15:48,887
Now, what the fuck
did you just fucking say?

1161
01:15:49,058 --> 01:15:53,017
Why do you think he never gets busted?
Costello's a protected FBI informant.

1162
01:15:53,195 --> 01:15:55,686
He'll trade you out.

1163
01:15:56,065 --> 01:15:58,761
I thought
I was supposed to go into shock.

1164
01:15:58,934 --> 01:16:02,028
I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts!

1165
01:16:02,204 --> 01:16:05,196
It fucking hurts!

1166
01:16:12,715 --> 01:16:14,945
Hey. It's me.

1167
01:16:15,117 --> 01:16:17,449
- What are you doing here?
- Come here.

1168
01:16:19,655 --> 01:16:22,419
Costello's giving people up to the FBI.

1169
01:16:22,591 --> 01:16:26,891
- The FBI?
- He is giving information to the FBI.

1170
01:16:27,063 --> 01:16:29,429
He's a protected fucking informant.

1171
01:16:29,598 --> 01:16:33,830
I mean, aren't they always trying to make it
a federal case and it never gets made?

1172
01:16:35,004 --> 01:16:37,632
Go around the back.
I'll open the door. Go on.

1173
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:44,710
- Here's some ice water.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

1174
01:16:49,785 --> 01:16:51,480
That's my son, Patrick.

1175
01:16:51,787 --> 01:16:54,915
- Goes to Notre Dame.
- Oh, yeah?

1176
01:16:55,091 --> 01:16:58,458
My wife's asleep but she left some
supper out. You want something to eat?

1177
01:16:58,627 --> 01:17:00,117
No. No, thanks.

1178
01:17:00,296 --> 01:17:03,891
Yeah, come on, man. You have
some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen.

1179
01:17:04,066 --> 01:17:05,693
Come on.

1180
01:17:41,237 --> 01:17:42,465
You want some coke?

1181
01:17:48,010 --> 01:17:49,910
There it is.

1182
01:17:50,546 --> 01:17:53,037
Don't move till you're numb.

1183
01:18:08,063 --> 01:18:09,997
Come on. Get inside.

1184
01:18:12,334 --> 01:18:14,165
Boss wants your real name...

1185
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:17,862
...your social and license number,
your bank account numbers.

1186
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,133
I don't have a bank account.

1187
01:18:20,309 --> 01:18:23,506
- I'm a cash business myself.
- What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

1188
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:27,615
Just fill the fucking paper in. Your real name
and all your account numbers.

1189
01:18:27,783 --> 01:18:29,614
Then we wait here.

1190
01:18:30,452 --> 01:18:33,182
- You're shitting me.
- No, I ain't.

1191
01:18:44,567 --> 01:18:46,694
Put the forms in there.

1192
01:18:50,206 --> 01:18:52,572
I don't know if this
is how you spell "citizens."

1193
01:18:52,741 --> 01:18:55,403
But fuck it, you know?

1194
01:18:55,911 --> 01:18:58,379
No, no, no. Come here.

1195
01:19:03,352 --> 01:19:05,343
What, are you fucking retarded
or something?

1196
01:19:05,521 --> 01:19:07,682
That ain't fucking right.

1197
01:19:07,856 --> 01:19:09,118
Are you kidding me?

1198
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:10,588
Look at this. Look.

1199
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,351
"Citizens." Look.

1200
01:19:13,696 --> 01:19:15,027
Billy, he said to stay here.

1201
01:19:15,397 --> 01:19:17,922
Yeah. I'm not sitting here
without a tetanus shot.

1202
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:19,465
Where the fuck are you going?

1203
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:23,799
I'm not staying, all right?
You can tell him I said that.

1204
01:19:43,125 --> 01:19:45,150
- Hey.
- Hi.

1205
01:19:47,196 --> 01:19:49,255
- It's pouring out there.
- Yeah.

1206
01:19:56,171 --> 01:19:58,036
Look...

1207
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,970
- ... if this is inappropriate, I...
- No.

1208
01:20:00,142 --> 01:20:02,770
No, it's not inappropriate.
You're not a patient.

1209
01:20:05,614 --> 01:20:07,582
So you moving out or you moving in?

1210
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:10,511
I've still got
three weeks left on the lease.

1211
01:20:19,695 --> 01:20:21,356
That's me.

1212
01:20:24,433 --> 01:20:25,923
Yeah, I know.

1213
01:20:32,007 --> 01:20:35,704
- Hedging your bets?
- No. No.

1214
01:20:36,078 --> 01:20:37,477
You have to choose.

1215
01:20:37,646 --> 01:20:40,308
- You have to make a...
- A decision.

1216
01:20:40,482 --> 01:20:43,883
A decision. And, you know, you have to
stick by what you choose.

1217
01:20:44,053 --> 01:20:46,317
- You have to...
- Move in with your boyfriend?

1218
01:20:46,488 --> 01:20:49,082
Yes. Otherwise it's...

1219
01:20:50,025 --> 01:20:52,926
Oh, I know, I know. I know.

1220
01:21:03,739 --> 01:21:08,972
I have to say your vulnerability
is really freaking me out right now.

1221
01:21:14,183 --> 01:21:15,844
Is it real?

1222
01:21:19,755 --> 01:21:21,484
I think so.

1223
01:21:27,396 --> 01:21:29,261
You don't have any cats.

1224
01:21:29,431 --> 01:21:30,989
No.

1225
01:21:31,967 --> 01:21:33,730
I like that.

1226
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:47,235
I don't get it.

1227
01:22:50,145 --> 01:22:52,773
We are all convinced
that Costello has at least...

1228
01:22:52,948 --> 01:22:56,111
...one mole inside
the Special Investigations Unit.

1229
01:22:56,285 --> 01:23:00,517
You will investigate everybody
and anybody.

1230
01:23:00,689 --> 01:23:04,853
Well, that's not exactly
a dream job for a cop.

1231
01:23:05,027 --> 01:23:08,292
We looked at all possible candidates.
You have an immaculate record.

1232
01:23:08,464 --> 01:23:11,797
Some people don't trust a guy
with an immaculate record. I do.

1233
01:23:11,967 --> 01:23:13,434
I have an immaculate record.

1234
01:23:14,703 --> 01:23:16,568
How is your wedding coming along?

1235
01:23:16,738 --> 01:23:19,172
Great. Great. She's a doctor.

1236
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:22,108
- That's outstanding.
- Yeah.

1237
01:23:22,277 --> 01:23:24,404
Marriage is an important part
of getting ahead.

1238
01:23:24,580 --> 01:23:27,481
Lets people know you're not a homo.
Married guy is more stable.

1239
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:30,311
People see the ring, think at least
someone can stand him.

1240
01:23:30,486 --> 01:23:34,547
Ladies see the ring, they know you must
have some cash and your cock must work.

1241
01:23:35,357 --> 01:23:37,791
Yeah, it's working. Overtime.

1242
01:23:38,227 --> 01:23:40,957
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you.

1243
01:24:29,044 --> 01:24:32,707
Be dirty, be dirty.

1244
01:24:34,883 --> 01:24:37,078
Yeah...

1245
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:45,021
Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?

1246
01:24:45,894 --> 01:24:48,920
- See anything you like, Col?
- I almost fucking shot you.

1247
01:24:49,097 --> 01:24:51,998
- You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you?
- Sit down.

1248
01:24:52,167 --> 01:24:56,228
I hope you're not turning into one of them
sob sisters wants to get caught.

1249
01:24:56,605 --> 01:24:58,300
You're not cracking up, are you?

1250
01:24:59,241 --> 01:25:01,801
- I don't crack up.
- Pick a place like this...

1251
01:25:01,977 --> 01:25:03,877
...where any cop could see you. Jesus.

1252
01:25:04,046 --> 01:25:07,209
If this is such a fucking bad idea
why'd you show up?

1253
01:25:07,816 --> 01:25:09,477
I own the place.

1254
01:25:11,787 --> 01:25:14,381
Why am I not fucking surprised?

1255
01:25:15,724 --> 01:25:19,455
- All right, lookit, I gotta tell you...
- You're getting reassigned. I know.

1256
01:25:20,162 --> 01:25:21,629
How the fuck do you know that?

1257
01:25:21,797 --> 01:25:24,095
- Where'd they put you?
- Hey, Frank.

1258
01:25:24,266 --> 01:25:27,827
I gotta find myself.

1259
01:25:28,003 --> 01:25:29,595
You're telling me, sonny boy.

1260
01:25:30,205 --> 01:25:32,605
I gotta find the guy
you got in the department.

1261
01:25:33,342 --> 01:25:36,971
With everybody looking up their own ass
and you looking for yourself...

1262
01:25:37,145 --> 01:25:39,204
...I put my money
on nobody finds nothing.

1263
01:25:39,381 --> 01:25:43,818
I know, but, Frank, lookit.
For me, you gotta lay low.

1264
01:25:43,986 --> 01:25:45,817
- Right now.
- Collie...

1265
01:25:45,988 --> 01:25:48,388
...laying low is not what I do.

1266
01:25:48,557 --> 01:25:51,219
All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank.
Fucking perfect.

1267
01:25:51,393 --> 01:25:53,623
What good am I to you
if you don't listen to me?

1268
01:25:53,795 --> 01:25:55,387
What good am I if you don't listen?

1269
01:26:00,535 --> 01:26:03,333
Queenan is compartmentalizing.
He's splitting everything up.

1270
01:26:03,505 --> 01:26:05,166
He's fucking smart. You know this.

1271
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:08,935
I can get the rat. You just gotta
let me do it my way, Frank.

1272
01:26:12,481 --> 01:26:13,641
Okay.

1273
01:26:17,486 --> 01:26:20,353
But Colin,
I hope I won't have to remind you...

1274
01:26:20,522 --> 01:26:24,549
...that if you don't find that cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

1275
01:26:24,726 --> 01:26:28,958
...most likely,
it won't be me who suffers for it.

1276
01:26:29,898 --> 01:26:32,389
Now, why would you have to
remind me of that?

1277
01:26:32,567 --> 01:26:37,732
Would I be any good at what I do
if I didn't fucking already know that?

1278
01:26:37,906 --> 01:26:40,340
Frank, you gotta trust me.

1279
01:26:40,876 --> 01:26:43,242
All right? Just trust me, Frank.

1280
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:49,041
Hey, it fucking involves lying
and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

1281
01:26:49,217 --> 01:26:50,878
Right?

1282
01:26:51,053 --> 01:26:53,681
Maybe because
it's always been so easy...

1283
01:26:53,855 --> 01:26:58,485
...for me to get cunt that I never understood
jerking off in a theater.

1284
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,558
Christ.

1285
01:27:08,704 --> 01:27:11,229
Who knows what's easy?

1286
01:27:12,007 --> 01:27:16,671
Colin, I know you'll take care
of business.

1287
01:28:01,423 --> 01:28:02,890
Shit!

1288
01:28:41,797 --> 01:28:43,230
Fuck.

1289
01:30:01,376 --> 01:30:02,866
Hey, how you doing?

1290
01:30:03,044 --> 01:30:05,205
Hi, Darlene, hi.

1291
01:30:09,384 --> 01:30:11,249
- That's it for me.
- Yeah, see you.

1292
01:30:11,419 --> 01:30:13,114
Have a good one.

1293
01:30:36,244 --> 01:30:38,405
I smell a rat.

1294
01:30:45,053 --> 01:30:46,281
Jesus Christ.

1295
01:30:47,355 --> 01:30:48,947
You got a girlfriend?

1296
01:30:50,892 --> 01:30:52,553
No.

1297
01:30:52,727 --> 01:30:54,786
No, no. Why, what does that matter?

1298
01:30:56,531 --> 01:30:57,896
It depends.

1299
01:31:00,101 --> 01:31:03,730
I'm sure by now you know...

1300
01:31:04,339 --> 01:31:07,467
...I got an informer in my outfit.

1301
01:31:08,443 --> 01:31:09,671
Cop.

1302
01:31:09,844 --> 01:31:15,111
Staties, Boston Police Department,
I'm not sure.

1303
01:31:15,283 --> 01:31:17,444
Jesus Christ.

1304
01:31:19,054 --> 01:31:21,682
Are you sure it's not the FBI?

1305
01:31:23,158 --> 01:31:26,025
It ain't the FBI.

1306
01:31:27,062 --> 01:31:28,996
Ex-wife.

1307
01:31:30,298 --> 01:31:32,357
Old girlfriend.

1308
01:31:33,735 --> 01:31:35,669
Or stupid.

1309
01:31:36,838 --> 01:31:40,205
That is what brings you down
in this business.

1310
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:42,070
Stupid, huh?

1311
01:31:42,744 --> 01:31:44,644
Well, I guess that leaves me out.

1312
01:31:48,883 --> 01:31:54,253
You know, past days, situation like this,
I kill everybody.

1313
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:57,424
Everybody who works for me.

1314
01:31:57,892 --> 01:32:00,190
Right. You know, Frank...

1315
01:32:00,362 --> 01:32:02,455
...I look around at your other guys...

1316
01:32:03,264 --> 01:32:06,199
I mean, they're all murderers, right?
Right?

1317
01:32:06,868 --> 01:32:10,031
And I think, "Could I do murder?"

1318
01:32:12,107 --> 01:32:15,270
And all I can answer myself is:

1319
01:32:16,778 --> 01:32:18,803
"What's the difference?"

1320
01:32:19,547 --> 01:32:21,879
Give them up to the Almighty.

1321
01:32:22,417 --> 01:32:25,113
You see, that's my point, you know?

1322
01:32:25,887 --> 01:32:30,381
You accuse me once, I put up with it.

1323
01:32:30,558 --> 01:32:31,889
You accuse me twice...

1324
01:32:33,528 --> 01:32:35,428
...I quit.

1325
01:32:36,031 --> 01:32:40,434
You pressure me to fear for my life and
I will put a fucking bullet in your head...

1326
01:32:40,602 --> 01:32:43,537
...as if you were anybody else. Okay?

1327
01:32:54,682 --> 01:32:58,345
You got something
you wanna ask me?

1328
01:33:00,488 --> 01:33:04,515
Look, you're 70 years old, Frank.
I'm just saying, okay?

1329
01:33:05,393 --> 01:33:07,691
One of your guys is gonna pop you.

1330
01:33:07,862 --> 01:33:10,194
- One of your guys is gonna pop you.
- Yeah, yeah.

1331
01:33:10,365 --> 01:33:12,663
As for running drugs,
what the fuck are you doing?

1332
01:33:12,834 --> 01:33:16,429
You don't need the money or the pain
in the ass. And they will catch you.

1333
01:33:16,604 --> 01:33:18,731
I haven't needed the money...

1334
01:33:18,907 --> 01:33:23,037
...since I took Archie's milk money
in the third grade.

1335
01:33:23,211 --> 01:33:26,476
Tell you the truth,
I don't need pussy anymore, either.

1336
01:33:27,949 --> 01:33:29,780
But I like it.

1337
01:33:30,952 --> 01:33:33,716
Point I'm making here is, Bill...

1338
01:33:33,888 --> 01:33:36,721
...I got this rat...

1339
01:33:36,891 --> 01:33:41,191
...this gnawing,
cheese-eating, fucking rat...

1340
01:33:41,362 --> 01:33:43,762
...and it brings up questions.

1341
01:33:43,932 --> 01:33:47,925
You know. See, Bill, like,
you're the new guy.

1342
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:51,001
Girlfriend...

1343
01:33:52,841 --> 01:33:57,710
Why don't you stay in the bar
that night I got your numbers?

1344
01:33:58,480 --> 01:34:01,142
Social-security numbers.

1345
01:34:01,316 --> 01:34:04,251
- Yeah.
- Everybody's fucking numbers.

1346
01:34:04,419 --> 01:34:07,217
Is there something that
you just wanna go ahead and ask me?

1347
01:34:07,388 --> 01:34:09,788
Because I'll give you
the fucking answer, all right?

1348
01:34:09,958 --> 01:34:11,892
Frank, look at me. Look at me.

1349
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:15,359
I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?

1350
01:34:15,530 --> 01:34:16,929
I'm not the fucking rat.

1351
01:34:18,032 --> 01:34:20,364
Start with you agree there is a rat.

1352
01:34:21,269 --> 01:34:22,793
You said there is one, all right?

1353
01:34:22,971 --> 01:34:26,498
I base most of what I do on the idea
that you're pretty good at what you do.

1354
01:34:26,674 --> 01:34:28,767
Sure. Sure, Will.

1355
01:34:28,943 --> 01:34:33,437
You, William. What would you do?

1356
01:34:38,453 --> 01:34:39,977
Frank, how many of these guys...

1357
01:34:40,155 --> 01:34:42,555
...have been with you
long enough to be disgruntled?

1358
01:34:42,724 --> 01:34:45,693
Think about it.
You don't pay much, you know.

1359
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:48,829
It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise.

1360
01:34:48,997 --> 01:34:52,524
The question is,
and this is the only question...

1361
01:34:53,368 --> 01:34:57,862
...who thinks that they can do what you do
better than you?

1362
01:34:58,806 --> 01:35:01,969
The only one
who could do what I do is me.

1363
01:35:03,244 --> 01:35:06,680
Lot of people had to die
for me to be me.

1364
01:35:09,184 --> 01:35:11,209
You wanna be me?

1365
01:35:14,923 --> 01:35:17,585
I probably could be you. Yeah.

1366
01:35:17,759 --> 01:35:19,249
Yeah, I know that much.

1367
01:35:20,562 --> 01:35:23,622
But I don't wanna be you, Frank.

1368
01:35:23,798 --> 01:35:26,062
I don't wanna be you.

1369
01:35:27,068 --> 01:35:32,005
"Heavy lies the crown" sort of thing.

1370
01:35:32,507 --> 01:35:33,940
Yeah.

1371
01:35:34,776 --> 01:35:37,244
- Francis.
- I'm out of here. You'll set the alarm...

1372
01:35:37,412 --> 01:35:41,508
- Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas.
- All right. Good night.

1373
01:35:44,018 --> 01:35:46,885
You know what I like about restaurants?

1374
01:35:47,055 --> 01:35:48,920
The fucking food? I don't know. What?

1375
01:35:49,424 --> 01:35:53,326
You learn a lot watching things eat.

1376
01:35:55,563 --> 01:35:57,895
There's a boat coming up Gloucester.

1377
01:35:58,866 --> 01:36:01,699
French will give you all the details.
Don't forget.

1378
01:36:01,869 --> 01:36:05,032
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

1379
01:36:09,210 --> 01:36:14,443
In the future, I tell you to do a thing,
you fucking do it. You got that?

1380
01:36:15,283 --> 01:36:17,547
I got it. Okay?

1381
01:36:19,921 --> 01:36:21,479
Excuse me...

1382
01:36:21,656 --> 01:36:24,318
- ... French, I forgot my...
- Okay, Francis.

1383
01:36:24,492 --> 01:36:25,481
...cigarette.

1384
01:36:28,463 --> 01:36:30,795
Eat something.

1385
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,429
Problem?

1386
01:36:40,608 --> 01:36:44,135
Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks
like you, okay? I don't like them.

1387
01:36:44,312 --> 01:36:46,644
The day you wouldn't take a promotion,
let me know.

1388
01:36:46,814 --> 01:36:48,941
If you'd taken care of this
I wouldn't be here.

1389
01:36:49,117 --> 01:36:52,644
- Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
- I need the identity of your undercovers.

1390
01:36:52,820 --> 01:36:56,381
Blow me. Not literally. Unfortunately,
there's no promotion involved for you.

1391
01:36:56,557 --> 01:36:57,546
Fucking prick.

1392
01:36:57,959 --> 01:37:00,951
- Hi, captain.
- Look who's here. The prom queen.

1393
01:37:01,129 --> 01:37:03,461
- They are not happy with me.
- What do you expect?

1394
01:37:03,798 --> 01:37:07,131
Everybody knows you've been assigned here
to find Costello's rat.

1395
01:37:07,902 --> 01:37:10,496
They want to find the leak
as much as you do.

1396
01:37:10,972 --> 01:37:15,033
Like I said, two days ago, my guy
damn near found out who Costello's rat is.

1397
01:37:16,778 --> 01:37:19,679
- But he lost him in the streets.
- Really?

1398
01:37:22,016 --> 01:37:25,281
- Well, did he get a look at the guy?
- No.

1399
01:37:25,453 --> 01:37:28,217
I mean, nothing? Like, I mean,
anything that could help us.

1400
01:37:28,389 --> 01:37:29,617
No.

1401
01:37:32,093 --> 01:37:34,994
So you got any advice for me?
Just, I mean, generally.

1402
01:37:35,763 --> 01:37:39,460
Costello can't do much business without
coordinating with his source...

1403
01:37:39,634 --> 01:37:41,499
...who is here in SIU.

1404
01:37:43,271 --> 01:37:45,637
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1405
01:37:53,281 --> 01:37:55,909
<i>You're gonna be looking at my people...</i>

1406
01:37:56,117 --> 01:38:00,349
<i>...going through their bank statements,
their phone calls and medical records.</i>

1407
01:38:00,521 --> 01:38:05,322
<i>Don't be surprised if they don't buy you
a beer or invite you into their homes.</i>

1408
01:38:06,761 --> 01:38:08,752
<i>Let me get you a coffee.</i>

1409
01:38:11,699 --> 01:38:14,930
<i>If I wasn't
with the Massachusetts State Police...</i>

1410
01:38:15,570 --> 01:38:18,505
...if I did it full-time, law school...

1411
01:38:19,107 --> 01:38:21,268
...I'd be through it in a year.

1412
01:38:22,577 --> 01:38:24,477
If I wasn't a trooper.

1413
01:38:28,783 --> 01:38:31,616
But another city. I was thinking that.

1414
01:38:32,854 --> 01:38:34,583
Another city.

1415
01:38:34,822 --> 01:38:37,154
Another city, huh?

1416
01:38:38,659 --> 01:38:41,787
Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.

1417
01:38:42,330 --> 01:38:45,595
<i>I want you to know,
you don't got to stay.</i>

1418
01:38:47,935 --> 01:38:49,732
If we're not gonna make it...

1419
01:38:49,904 --> 01:38:54,364
...it's gotta be you that gets out,
because I'm not capable.

1420
01:38:55,676 --> 01:39:00,010
I'm fucking Irish. I'll deal with something
being wrong for the rest of my life.

1421
01:39:08,790 --> 01:39:12,624
<i>It might not be a bad idea,
you know, another city.</i>

1422
01:39:30,878 --> 01:39:33,642
- Of course I know how to spot a cop.
- How's that?

1423
01:39:33,815 --> 01:39:36,841
If he's not paying attention to us,
he's a cop.

1424
01:39:37,018 --> 01:39:40,283
Lookit. You see that guy over there?
Right over there.

1425
01:39:40,455 --> 01:39:41,444
Yeah.

1426
01:39:41,622 --> 01:39:45,319
Not paying attention to us.
He's a cop.

1427
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:48,793
- Okay.
- You get it now, do you?

1428
01:39:54,735 --> 01:39:56,703
- What about this guy?
- Cop.

1429
01:39:59,273 --> 01:40:02,003
Hey, how you doing?
What kind of dog is that?

1430
01:40:03,778 --> 01:40:06,110
She ignored us so she must be a cop.

1431
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:08,578
She's probably
the fucking police commissioner.

1432
01:40:20,094 --> 01:40:24,121
You can get out of here. I'm using
a new crew tonight. New guys.

1433
01:40:25,867 --> 01:40:30,497
- I thought I was on for this.
- I changed my mind. Take the night off.

1434
01:40:30,671 --> 01:40:34,869
Francis, we're ready for the sushi bar.

1435
01:40:35,643 --> 01:40:38,203
- Jimmy, bring a mop.
- Out the back.

1436
01:40:39,213 --> 01:40:41,306
There's guys who answer
the questions right...

1437
01:40:41,482 --> 01:40:43,780
- ... and there's guys that don't.
- And a pail.

1438
01:40:46,187 --> 01:40:47,814
You're a cop.

1439
01:40:48,289 --> 01:40:49,620
What?

1440
01:40:49,790 --> 01:40:51,917
You ignored us, you're a cop.

1441
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:56,691
We're guessing who cops are. You know,
most good-looking women are cops.

1442
01:40:58,132 --> 01:41:01,260
Well, I'm going home, all right?
He's playing with his new guys.

1443
01:41:01,435 --> 01:41:03,369
- See you later, all right?
- See you later.

1444
01:41:10,211 --> 01:41:13,271
He's moving something with all new guys.
A whole new crew.

1445
01:41:13,447 --> 01:41:16,644
No, no, I can't tell you what or where.
It's probably disinformation.

1446
01:41:16,817 --> 01:41:20,116
Just keep following him, all right?
Listen, I need to see you today.

1447
01:41:20,288 --> 01:41:21,721
<i>- Tomorrow.
- No, no, no. Today.</i>

1448
01:41:21,889 --> 01:41:24,255
<i>- You heard nothing about drugs?
- No.</i>

1449
01:41:24,425 --> 01:41:27,883
Nothing about new guys?
Nothing about Gloucester?

1450
01:41:28,062 --> 01:41:31,828
Not a thing. And I would have.
That information would have come to me.

1451
01:41:33,701 --> 01:41:35,328
It ain't Bill.

1452
01:41:35,503 --> 01:41:37,266
No way, he says.

1453
01:41:49,784 --> 01:41:52,150
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

1454
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,844
Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan.

1455
01:41:54,021 --> 01:41:58,424
I want constant surveillance
on Captain Queenan, starting right now.

1456
01:41:59,460 --> 01:42:01,155
Good. Thank you.

1457
01:42:03,998 --> 01:42:07,934
Can I ask a question, sarge? Why the fuck
are we following Captain Queenan?

1458
01:42:08,102 --> 01:42:10,002
To find out about the good Catholic life?

1459
01:42:10,171 --> 01:42:13,334
I have to follow every lead,
however unlikely...

1460
01:42:13,507 --> 01:42:17,273
...however fucking painful it might be
to your delicate fucking sensibilities.

1461
01:42:17,445 --> 01:42:19,436
Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?

1462
01:42:19,614 --> 01:42:23,141
<i>- I just don't like it. Don't feel right.
- I have reason to believe...</i>

1463
01:42:23,317 --> 01:42:26,047
...that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat.

1464
01:42:26,220 --> 01:42:28,518
So just follow him and don't get made.

1465
01:42:31,859 --> 01:42:34,726
Sarge, we got the target coming out.

1466
01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:12,426
Hey. Where are you?

1467
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,568
<i>Look down the car.</i>

1468
01:43:15,970 --> 01:43:18,438
<i>- You got me?
- Yeah, I gotcha.</i>

1469
01:43:18,606 --> 01:43:20,471
Is there a reason you would have a tail?

1470
01:43:20,975 --> 01:43:22,374
No.

1471
01:43:24,011 --> 01:43:26,844
- Because I think...
- Billy, I don't have a tail.

1472
01:43:28,182 --> 01:43:31,811
Get off at the next stop, all right?
South Station. You wait there 10 minutes.

1473
01:43:31,986 --> 01:43:34,250
South Station. Wait 10 minutes.

1474
01:44:10,191 --> 01:44:13,388
He just went into a building
down the waterfront. 344 Wash.

1475
01:44:13,561 --> 01:44:16,086
You got that? 344 Wash.

1476
01:44:20,267 --> 01:44:21,894
Yeah, he went up to the top floor.

1477
01:44:26,474 --> 01:44:29,136
Building's empty. No tenants here.

1478
01:44:30,644 --> 01:44:33,943
He's got dope coming in.
I don't know where. He...

1479
01:44:34,782 --> 01:44:36,272
He's getting spooky, captain.

1480
01:44:36,450 --> 01:44:37,576
- What?
- I just saw him.

1481
01:44:37,752 --> 01:44:40,277
He had blood on his hands.
He's lost his fucking mind.

1482
01:44:46,861 --> 01:44:49,295
I don't know
what we're doing here, boys.

1483
01:44:49,930 --> 01:44:52,899
He's not including his regular guys.
But I'll tell you something.

1484
01:44:53,067 --> 01:44:56,594
Sooner or later he's gonna find out
who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me.

1485
01:44:56,771 --> 01:44:59,103
- I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me!
- All right!

1486
01:45:05,946 --> 01:45:08,915
I think we got him. I think Queenan's
meeting with him right now.

1487
01:45:09,083 --> 01:45:10,778
All right, all right. Listen to me.

1488
01:45:10,951 --> 01:45:13,749
I'm really sorry for your trouble.
I swear to God I am.

1489
01:45:13,921 --> 01:45:17,186
I'll get you out of this. I can't
do it overnight but I'll get you out.

1490
01:45:18,259 --> 01:45:19,317
Yeah?

1491
01:45:19,493 --> 01:45:22,189
Hey, get the van. We're moving.
Heavy work.

1492
01:45:22,363 --> 01:45:24,695
- What about the FBI?
- They're compromised.

1493
01:45:24,865 --> 01:45:26,298
- They're what?
- They're fucked.

1494
01:45:30,337 --> 01:45:31,497
<i>- Yeah.
- Where are you?</i>

1495
01:45:31,672 --> 01:45:33,970
We've been trying to reach you.
We found the rat.

1496
01:45:34,441 --> 01:45:36,432
<i>Listen, we're gonna take him out.
Lookit:</i>

1497
01:45:36,610 --> 01:45:39,204
The address is 314 Washington Street.
You got it?

1498
01:45:39,380 --> 01:45:40,813
All right, we'll see you there.

1499
01:45:41,348 --> 01:45:42,576
- What?
- You were followed.

1500
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:44,342
- By who?
- By Costello's people.

1501
01:45:44,518 --> 01:45:45,951
- Impossible.
- One of the cops...

1502
01:45:46,120 --> 01:45:48,850
...he's got on the inside tipped him.
Come on. Come on.

1503
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:51,348
Come on!

1504
01:45:57,998 --> 01:46:00,466
What the fuck is going on?

1505
01:46:01,569 --> 01:46:04,402
Fucking shit. Looks like Queenan's
meeting with all of them.

1506
01:46:05,306 --> 01:46:07,740
Yeah, he must be our guy.

1507
01:46:07,908 --> 01:46:11,207
<i>Sarge, we gotta get him out of here.
Those guys aren't fucking around.</i>

1508
01:46:16,150 --> 01:46:18,983
Ah, Christ, it's too late.
Let's go back up.

1509
01:46:23,057 --> 01:46:24,854
- Shit!
- You got to get out of here!

1510
01:46:25,025 --> 01:46:26,856
- Take the fire escape.
- What about you?

1511
01:46:27,027 --> 01:46:30,053
I'll be fine. But if you get made
I can't protect you. Now, go!

1512
01:46:47,681 --> 01:46:50,241
- One of you mugs got a light?
- Where's your boy?

1513
01:46:50,417 --> 01:46:53,443
- He's studying law at Notre Dame.
- Where's your fucking boy?

1514
01:46:53,621 --> 01:46:55,714
- Hey! Hey!
- Goddamn motherfucker!

1515
01:46:55,890 --> 01:46:57,915
- Fucking kill you!
- Where's your fucking boy?

1516
01:47:14,241 --> 01:47:17,233
What the fuck was that?
Did you fucking see that?

1517
01:47:21,582 --> 01:47:23,607
Sarge, something
just came off the building.

1518
01:47:24,418 --> 01:47:26,477
What the fuck?

1519
01:47:29,556 --> 01:47:30,545
Fuck.

1520
01:47:30,724 --> 01:47:32,624
What do you mean,
off the building?

1521
01:47:32,793 --> 01:47:35,489
- Something came off the fucking roof.
- It's a fucking body.

1522
01:47:44,204 --> 01:47:46,104
We can't get a visual.
Want us to get out?

1523
01:47:46,273 --> 01:47:49,037
We gotta get on foot
if you want me to get up on this thing.

1524
01:47:49,643 --> 01:47:51,133
- Where were you?
- What happened?

1525
01:47:51,312 --> 01:47:53,109
You're fucking late! Get in the van!

1526
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,645
What do you mean,
off the roof?

1527
01:47:54,815 --> 01:47:56,476
What's going on? I came to meet you.

1528
01:47:56,650 --> 01:47:58,174
- What the fuck...?
- Get in the van!

1529
01:47:58,352 --> 01:48:01,287
I got four armed men right out front.
You want us to pursue?

1530
01:48:01,455 --> 01:48:03,514
No, do not pursue. Stay in the car.

1531
01:48:03,691 --> 01:48:05,818
- Fuck. No fucking pursuit.
- I need information.

1532
01:48:05,993 --> 01:48:07,358
What came off the roof?

1533
01:48:07,528 --> 01:48:09,018
- No pursuit.
- That's bullshit.

1534
01:48:09,196 --> 01:48:10,959
Fuck this.

1535
01:48:19,039 --> 01:48:20,666
Fitzy! Get in the van!

1536
01:48:22,176 --> 01:48:25,111
Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move!

1537
01:48:25,279 --> 01:48:26,906
All right. I got him.

1538
01:48:33,354 --> 01:48:35,549
32X to CP. We're being fired upon!

1539
01:48:35,723 --> 01:48:39,124
<i>An officer is down. I repeat,
an officer is down. A trooper's been shot!</i>

1540
01:48:39,293 --> 01:48:41,318
<i>Send some back...</i>

1541
01:48:58,679 --> 01:49:01,842
So do you know
why Queenan went into that building?

1542
01:49:02,016 --> 01:49:03,847
- No.
- Well, a better question...

1543
01:49:04,018 --> 01:49:06,179
...is why the fuck
were your guys following him?

1544
01:49:06,353 --> 01:49:09,083
I told Internal Investigations
to follow Captain Queenan.

1545
01:49:09,256 --> 01:49:11,656
- Why?
- That's Internal Investigations' business.

1546
01:49:12,559 --> 01:49:14,220
Fucking piece of shit!

1547
01:49:14,395 --> 01:49:15,885
- All right.
- Hey, hey!

1548
01:49:16,063 --> 01:49:17,428
- Fucking bitch!
- Let him go!

1549
01:49:17,598 --> 01:49:20,761
Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain
anything to anybody!

1550
01:49:20,934 --> 01:49:23,095
I can fucking investigate
anybody I want to!

1551
01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:25,500
- Come on!
- I don't give a fuck what you think!

1552
01:49:25,672 --> 01:49:29,073
I got reason to believe that Queenan
got killed by his fucking undercover.

1553
01:49:29,243 --> 01:49:30,335
That's a fucking lie.

1554
01:49:30,511 --> 01:49:34,072
He has fucking information
in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan.

1555
01:49:34,248 --> 01:49:35,840
I need access to those files.

1556
01:49:36,016 --> 01:49:39,042
I forgot the password but
if you come with me I'll give it to you.

1557
01:49:39,219 --> 01:49:41,346
- That's a fucking lie.
- Nobody calls me a liar!

1558
01:49:41,522 --> 01:49:44,320
Shut up! Work with the tech guys
to unlock those files.

1559
01:49:44,491 --> 01:49:47,358
- Dignam, take a leave of absence.
- Take a leave of what?

1560
01:49:47,528 --> 01:49:50,463
Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.

1561
01:49:50,631 --> 01:49:52,997
I don't care.
I'd rather hand in my papers first.

1562
01:49:53,167 --> 01:49:56,568
World needs plenty of bartenders.
Two weeks with pay.

1563
01:49:56,737 --> 01:49:58,204
Good.

1564
01:50:00,040 --> 01:50:01,632
- Piece of shit.
- Fuck off.

1565
01:50:03,577 --> 01:50:05,408
- I need those codes.
- No.

1566
01:50:05,579 --> 01:50:07,706
You want those codes.

1567
01:50:10,818 --> 01:50:12,547
So where the fuck were you?

1568
01:50:14,221 --> 01:50:16,781
Well, boss told me to go home.

1569
01:50:16,957 --> 01:50:21,155
Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
But you weren't at fucking home.

1570
01:50:21,328 --> 01:50:22,795
So where the fuck were you?

1571
01:50:23,397 --> 01:50:26,298
I was at the grocery store
with no signal, all right?

1572
01:50:26,467 --> 01:50:28,458
When I got the signal, I got the call.

1573
01:50:28,635 --> 01:50:31,661
What the fuck do you want from me?
Was I there or was I not there?

1574
01:50:31,839 --> 01:50:33,898
Billy. Billy.

1575
01:50:40,280 --> 01:50:41,804
Yeah?

1576
01:50:44,017 --> 01:50:46,008
Yeah?

1577
01:50:46,487 --> 01:50:48,648
You know what I thought today?

1578
01:50:50,457 --> 01:50:52,152
What's that?

1579
01:50:53,160 --> 01:50:56,618
Who didn't show up today is the rat.

1580
01:51:00,100 --> 01:51:01,465
Yeah?

1581
01:51:02,503 --> 01:51:06,303
- So?
- And you never been late in your life.

1582
01:51:08,208 --> 01:51:10,438
When I called you...

1583
01:51:10,611 --> 01:51:12,841
...I made a mistake.

1584
01:51:13,013 --> 01:51:16,813
I gave you the wrong address...

1585
01:51:16,984 --> 01:51:20,818
...but you showed up at the right one...

1586
01:51:21,288 --> 01:51:23,188
...didn't you?

1587
01:51:24,458 --> 01:51:27,018
Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh?

1588
01:51:28,295 --> 01:51:29,626
Tell me why.

1589
01:51:52,519 --> 01:51:55,920
That cop was tough.
We were excessive with the cop.

1590
01:51:56,089 --> 01:51:57,886
He's dead.

1591
01:51:58,058 --> 01:51:59,685
I'm going home.

1592
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:02,658
<i>- Your guys should not have done that.
- One of us had to die.</i>

1593
01:52:02,829 --> 01:52:04,854
With me it tends to be the other guy.

1594
01:52:05,032 --> 01:52:06,499
But Queenan.
Now I got no access.

1595
01:52:06,667 --> 01:52:09,864
You killed the guy who had the info.
Dignam's gone. Forget about him.

1596
01:52:10,037 --> 01:52:12,699
<i>- He resigned.
- I don't give a fuck about Dignam.</i>

1597
01:52:12,873 --> 01:52:14,340
<i>He put in his papers, Frank.</i>

1598
01:52:14,508 --> 01:52:18,569
- He left. I don't know where he is.
- Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie.

1599
01:52:18,745 --> 01:52:20,178
<i>That Irish pissant...</i>

1600
01:52:20,347 --> 01:52:24,010
...he's so hot for me, we give him
a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.

1601
01:52:24,184 --> 01:52:26,243
<i>Let's give him a whiff.</i>

1602
01:52:26,420 --> 01:52:30,083
- I will.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1603
01:52:31,758 --> 01:52:33,419
Sweetheart.

1604
01:52:33,594 --> 01:52:35,789
You're giving me a hard-on.

1605
01:52:36,396 --> 01:52:37,795
Are you sure it's me?

1606
01:52:38,298 --> 01:52:41,563
Not all that talk
about whiffing and crawling up asses?

1607
01:52:42,035 --> 01:52:44,026
Watch your fucking mouth.

1608
01:52:44,204 --> 01:52:46,638
No. You watch it.

1609
01:52:47,341 --> 01:52:49,639
Let me straighten you out.

1610
01:52:57,551 --> 01:53:00,418
I tried to call you a few times.

1611
01:53:03,624 --> 01:53:05,387
I know.

1612
01:53:31,785 --> 01:53:35,687
Listen, I can't be a friend to you.

1613
01:53:40,827 --> 01:53:42,727
I'm sorry.

1614
01:53:49,202 --> 01:53:50,931
Yeah...

1615
01:53:55,509 --> 01:53:57,136
...I know.

1616
01:56:05,772 --> 01:56:07,262
Yeah.

1617
01:56:08,074 --> 01:56:11,305
You called this number
on a dead guy's phone.

1618
01:56:11,745 --> 01:56:13,303
Who are you?

1619
01:56:13,547 --> 01:56:15,811
So it is you.

1620
01:56:17,017 --> 01:56:20,009
Well, thank God you're all right.
We were very worried.

1621
01:56:21,421 --> 01:56:23,048
Who are you?

1622
01:56:23,957 --> 01:56:25,982
This is Sergeant Sullivan.

1623
01:56:26,159 --> 01:56:27,922
I'm taking over Queenan's unit.

1624
01:56:28,628 --> 01:56:30,653
Let me talk to Dignam
to confirm it.

1625
01:56:30,831 --> 01:56:32,162
<i>Staff Sergeant Dignam...</i>

1626
01:56:32,332 --> 01:56:35,529
...is on a leave of absence.
He's very upset.

1627
01:56:35,702 --> 01:56:37,897
We're all very upset.

1628
01:56:38,538 --> 01:56:41,302
<i>I think the best thing would be
for you to come in.</i>

1629
01:56:42,275 --> 01:56:45,176
We need you to come in.
Can you come in?

1630
01:56:46,646 --> 01:56:47,635
<i>We'll meet...</i>

1631
01:57:26,820 --> 01:57:29,118
<i>Police confirm
the body of the man found dead...</i>

1632
01:57:29,289 --> 01:57:31,257
<i>...in the Fenway marshes
yesterday...</i>

1633
01:57:31,424 --> 01:57:34,416
<i>...is that of Timothy Delahunt,
an undercover policeman for...</i>

1634
01:57:34,594 --> 01:57:37,085
<i>...the city of Boston.
This was the scene yesterday...</i>

1635
01:57:37,264 --> 01:57:40,233
<i>...when Delahunt's body was found
in the marshes near the Fenway.</i>

1636
01:57:40,400 --> 01:57:41,958
<i>As for who did this or why...</i>

1637
01:57:42,135 --> 01:57:44,535
<i>...that's something police
are working on right now.</i>

1638
01:57:44,704 --> 01:57:48,162
- I don't believe it.
- What can't you believe?

1639
01:57:48,408 --> 01:57:51,866
I spent all fucking night dragging
the poor bastard in there.

1640
01:57:52,045 --> 01:57:53,979
Tell me how they found him so fast.

1641
01:57:54,147 --> 01:57:56,775
Somebody walking
a fucking dog in three feet of mud?

1642
01:57:56,950 --> 01:57:59,111
What kind of fucking
size of dog is that?

1643
01:57:59,286 --> 01:58:01,413
Must have been a big fucking dog, man.

1644
01:58:01,588 --> 01:58:03,818
I spent all fucking night doing it, man.

1645
01:58:04,190 --> 01:58:05,487
I'm embarrassed.

1646
01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:08,821
I still don't believe he was a cop.
I don't believe it.

1647
01:58:08,995 --> 01:58:13,523
The cops are saying he's a cop...

1648
01:58:13,900 --> 01:58:16,095
...so I won't look for the cop.

1649
01:58:17,370 --> 01:58:18,997
Are you soft, Fitz?

1650
01:58:19,172 --> 01:58:24,132
When I tell you to dump
a body in the marsh...

1651
01:58:24,311 --> 01:58:27,246
...you dump him in the marsh.

1652
01:58:28,281 --> 01:58:31,580
Not where some guy from
John Hancock goes every Thursday...

1653
01:58:31,751 --> 01:58:33,844
...to get a fucking blowjob!

1654
01:58:34,621 --> 01:58:36,782
Don't laugh!

1655
01:58:37,624 --> 01:58:40,525
This ain't reality TV!

1656
01:58:44,464 --> 01:58:46,227
Proceed.

1657
01:59:08,688 --> 01:59:10,155
- What?
- Yeah.

1658
01:59:10,323 --> 01:59:13,087
You got a tail. Two cars.
Not very subtle.

1659
01:59:13,259 --> 01:59:16,820
They're not gonna be subtle from now on.
That's what I've been trying to say.

1660
01:59:16,997 --> 01:59:18,123
So get rid of them.

1661
01:59:18,298 --> 01:59:21,392
There's no need for you
to go yourself, Frank.

1662
01:59:21,568 --> 01:59:23,798
Get rid of the fucking tail!

1663
01:59:28,742 --> 01:59:30,300
All right.

1664
01:59:36,616 --> 01:59:39,813
Fucking rats.
It's wearing me thin.

1665
01:59:39,986 --> 01:59:42,784
Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.

1666
01:59:59,105 --> 02:00:02,438
Stop, stop. Pull them off Costello.
There's no need to surveil him.

1667
02:00:02,609 --> 02:00:04,975
- What are you saying?
- I got it from an undercover.

1668
02:00:05,145 --> 02:00:07,807
He knows he's being followed.
So let the UC take him in.

1669
02:00:08,014 --> 02:00:09,379
- Undercover?
- Queenan's guy.

1670
02:00:09,549 --> 02:00:12,211
He called when he found out
Queenan died. I'm running him.

1671
02:00:12,385 --> 02:00:15,320
- You give him to me.
- No, I can give you Costello's destination.

1672
02:00:15,522 --> 02:00:17,990
- You know where he's going?
- Yes. And what he's doing.

1673
02:00:18,158 --> 02:00:20,319
Get rid of the tail,
get Special Ops on standby.

1674
02:00:20,493 --> 02:00:22,927
- We'll take this prick tonight.
- Let's go. Now.

1675
02:00:23,096 --> 02:00:26,088
All units fall back.
All units fall back.

1676
02:00:46,453 --> 02:00:48,512
It's the warehouse he owns
over on Sheffield.

1677
02:00:48,688 --> 02:00:51,282
He's gotta have a container or a truck
or something there. Go.

1678
02:01:15,582 --> 02:01:17,106
Load it.

1679
02:01:25,125 --> 02:01:27,423
Frank, how do you know
you don't have a tail, huh?

1680
02:01:28,695 --> 02:01:30,663
Were you not in the fucking car?

1681
02:01:30,830 --> 02:01:33,890
Yeah, what if they took one off
and they put another one on?

1682
02:01:37,103 --> 02:01:38,900
Load.

1683
02:01:46,479 --> 02:01:48,310
Go, go!

1684
02:01:50,750 --> 02:01:52,308
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

1685
02:01:54,387 --> 02:01:56,514
Frank wants me to check
the back. You go ahead.

1686
02:01:56,689 --> 02:02:00,147
- Watch your fucking back.
- Move out! Go on!

1687
02:02:09,169 --> 02:02:11,603
Cocksuckers.

1688
02:02:17,610 --> 02:02:20,170
Motherfucking shit!

1689
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:25,277
Motherfucking...!

1690
02:02:28,688 --> 02:02:30,952
Back the fuck up!

1691
02:02:31,124 --> 02:02:33,217
They fucking shot me.

1692
02:02:36,930 --> 02:02:38,056
Get down!

1693
02:02:41,067 --> 02:02:42,625
Come on, fucking bastards!

1694
02:03:01,354 --> 02:03:02,821
Fuck it.

1695
02:03:42,262 --> 02:03:46,028
How the fuck did this happen?

1696
02:03:47,433 --> 02:03:50,027
You're an FBI informant?

1697
02:03:50,203 --> 02:03:52,398
Are you fucking kidding me?

1698
02:03:53,873 --> 02:03:55,568
Grow up.

1699
02:03:56,276 --> 02:03:59,211
Of course I talk to the FBI.

1700
02:03:59,379 --> 02:04:00,869
Do they know who I am?

1701
02:04:02,815 --> 02:04:07,184
I never gave up anybody
who wasn't going down anyway.

1702
02:04:08,221 --> 02:04:10,655
Nobody knows nothing.

1703
02:04:12,258 --> 02:04:13,748
Frank.

1704
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:16,961
Frank. Frank.

1705
02:04:17,130 --> 02:04:19,121
Do they know about me?

1706
02:04:20,833 --> 02:04:23,358
I know about you, Collie.

1707
02:04:23,536 --> 02:04:26,369
You know I'd never give you up.

1708
02:04:27,106 --> 02:04:29,870
- You're like a...
- What? Like a son?

1709
02:04:30,777 --> 02:04:34,144
To you? Is that what this is about?

1710
02:04:35,114 --> 02:04:39,448
All that murdering and fucking,
and no sons.

1711
02:05:01,474 --> 02:05:03,908
Fucking rat prick!

1712
02:05:25,498 --> 02:05:27,090
<i>Frank?</i>

1713
02:05:27,266 --> 02:05:28,756
Yeah?

1714
02:05:30,503 --> 02:05:31,731
Who's this?

1715
02:05:33,639 --> 02:05:35,266
Gwen?

1716
02:05:36,409 --> 02:05:38,502
Where the hell's Frank?

1717
02:05:39,579 --> 02:05:41,376
Frank got shot.

1718
02:05:44,217 --> 02:05:46,617
Gwen, we lost Frank.

1719
02:05:54,994 --> 02:05:56,621
I got him!

1720
02:05:56,796 --> 02:05:59,230
I got Costello here!

1721
02:06:03,369 --> 02:06:05,860
Hey, good job, sarge.

1722
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:08,197
No, it's...

1723
02:06:09,609 --> 02:06:11,201
For you.

1724
02:06:12,278 --> 02:06:15,338
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

1725
02:06:18,851 --> 02:06:22,082
He's been waiting here
a long time for you.

1726
02:06:22,288 --> 02:06:24,722
How'd you get him without the files?

1727
02:06:24,891 --> 02:06:27,689
Caller ID on Queenan's phone.

1728
02:06:28,661 --> 02:06:30,026
You know that guy?

1729
02:06:30,196 --> 02:06:33,063
Yeah. We were classmates
in the academy together.

1730
02:06:40,506 --> 02:06:42,167
Good to see you, trooper.

1731
02:06:42,341 --> 02:06:45,003
- Yeah.
- Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone.

1732
02:06:45,178 --> 02:06:46,736
- Yeah.
- So.

1733
02:06:48,281 --> 02:06:50,044
Now, how long were you undercover?

1734
02:06:50,216 --> 02:06:52,116
Long time.

1735
02:06:52,285 --> 02:06:54,116
- Long fucking time.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1736
02:06:54,520 --> 02:06:59,457
Well, I can't even tell you the debt...

1737
02:07:02,295 --> 02:07:05,628
I just want you to know I'll be
recommending you for the Medal of Merit.

1738
02:07:05,798 --> 02:07:07,493
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1739
02:07:08,434 --> 02:07:10,800
That's kind of like a gold star
around here, huh?

1740
02:07:12,839 --> 02:07:14,636
It's the highest honor we got.

1741
02:07:14,807 --> 02:07:17,605
Look, I just want
my identity back, all right?

1742
02:07:17,777 --> 02:07:19,768
- That's all.
- All right.

1743
02:07:19,946 --> 02:07:22,847
- I understand. You wanna be a cop again.
- No, no.

1744
02:07:23,015 --> 02:07:26,610
Being a cop's not an identity.
I want my identity back.

1745
02:07:26,886 --> 02:07:29,855
Check your computer. Go on.
You'll have to excuse my behavior.

1746
02:07:30,022 --> 02:07:33,981
My only contact in the last six months
has been a police shrink.

1747
02:07:36,629 --> 02:07:38,927
How's that working for you?

1748
02:07:39,098 --> 02:07:40,827
Is it helpful?

1749
02:07:41,567 --> 02:07:44,331
What are you gonna do
about Costello's rat in this building?

1750
02:07:46,939 --> 02:07:50,170
- I'm gonna find the prick.
- Yeah.

1751
02:07:50,610 --> 02:07:53,306
I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna arrest him.

1752
02:07:53,479 --> 02:07:56,642
- Good.
- Anything you can do to help me...

1753
02:07:56,816 --> 02:08:00,650
You know, I mean, did Frank ever
mention a name...? You know, anything.

1754
02:08:00,820 --> 02:08:03,414
Someone he was in contact with.
Anything you can give me.

1755
02:08:03,589 --> 02:08:06,149
I'm all done being a cop, all right?

1756
02:08:06,325 --> 02:08:08,486
I just want my money
and I wanna go home.

1757
02:08:08,661 --> 02:08:11,061
All right. That'll be
the best thing for everybody.

1758
02:08:11,230 --> 02:08:12,629
Fair enough.

1759
02:08:13,232 --> 02:08:17,692
I just, I can't get into your file
unless I have your password.

1760
02:08:19,872 --> 02:08:20,896
It's my name.

1761
02:08:21,707 --> 02:08:24,073
William Costigan Jr.

1762
02:08:24,243 --> 02:08:27,508
They gave it to me in case I had to
explain myself to someone like you.

1763
02:08:28,080 --> 02:08:30,014
It's your name.

1764
02:08:32,118 --> 02:08:33,517
All right.

1765
02:08:33,686 --> 02:08:36,382
Fucking unreal, that...
Well, makes a lot of sense.

1766
02:08:36,556 --> 02:08:38,786
Listen, Bill, I gotta run this
in the other room.

1767
02:08:38,958 --> 02:08:41,222
This computer's getting
all frigging blooey on me.

1768
02:08:41,394 --> 02:08:45,160
Give me two minutes. I'll have
you out of here in no time.

1769
02:10:18,491 --> 02:10:22,325
All right, everything checks out,
so let's get you paid.

1770
02:10:53,292 --> 02:10:55,055
I know.

1771
02:10:56,595 --> 02:10:59,086
I know. I'm not...
I'm not here for that, okay?

1772
02:10:59,365 --> 02:11:00,957
I'm not.

1773
02:11:03,169 --> 02:11:06,434
Listen. I've gotta give you something.

1774
02:11:06,605 --> 02:11:09,039
Something I need you to keep.

1775
02:11:09,208 --> 02:11:10,800
For me.

1776
02:11:13,079 --> 02:11:14,671
Okay?

1777
02:11:18,284 --> 02:11:22,584
- What is it?
- This is for you to hold. Only you.

1778
02:11:22,755 --> 02:11:26,714
You open this if something happens to me
or if I call you and I tell you to open it.

1779
02:11:26,892 --> 02:11:29,452
You're the only person
I can trust, all right?

1780
02:11:31,063 --> 02:11:32,655
Please.

1781
02:11:36,202 --> 02:11:38,602
- All right.
- Look, I'm sorry to even...

1782
02:11:38,771 --> 02:11:41,467
I'm sorry to even show up here
like this, you know?

1783
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:44,905
I... There's just no one else
I could give it to.

1784
02:11:46,345 --> 02:11:48,506
There's no one else.

1785
02:11:49,281 --> 02:11:52,011
- I'm really sorry.
- I...

1786
02:11:52,618 --> 02:11:54,586
You know, I have...

1787
02:11:54,754 --> 02:11:57,188
- I...
- Whatever you have to say...

1788
02:11:57,356 --> 02:11:59,551
...think about it real hard, all right?

1789
02:11:59,725 --> 02:12:03,252
If you still wanna tell me,
you tell me in two weeks, okay?

1790
02:12:33,025 --> 02:12:34,959
I was dreaming I was dead.

1791
02:12:36,328 --> 02:12:40,526
Death is hard. Life is much easier.

1792
02:12:41,467 --> 02:12:44,698
- What's this?
- Open it.

1793
02:12:53,546 --> 02:12:56,208
- Really?
- Yeah.

1794
02:12:57,249 --> 02:12:58,716
Really?

1795
02:12:59,385 --> 02:13:00,909
Yeah.

1796
02:13:01,086 --> 02:13:04,647
And they say
that this little speck...

1797
02:13:04,824 --> 02:13:07,019
...is a penis.

1798
02:13:10,296 --> 02:13:12,161
It's a boy.

1799
02:13:12,331 --> 02:13:15,129
Yeah, well,
one usually follows the other.

1800
02:13:16,635 --> 02:13:18,626
Can you still...?

1801
02:14:09,188 --> 02:14:11,179
<i>I hope I won't have to remind you...</i>

1802
02:14:11,357 --> 02:14:15,555
<i>...that if you don't find this cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...</i>

1803
02:14:15,728 --> 02:14:19,391
<i>...you can assume it won't be me
who pays for it.</i>

1804
02:14:19,565 --> 02:14:22,398
<i>Now, why would you
have to remind me of that?</i>

1805
02:14:22,568 --> 02:14:27,870
<i>Would I...? Would I be any good at what
I do if I didn't fucking already know that?</i>

1806
02:14:28,040 --> 02:14:31,237
<i>Frank, you gotta trust me.
I can get the rat.</i>

1807
02:14:31,410 --> 02:14:33,776
<i>You just gotta let me do it
my way, Frank.</i>

1808
02:14:33,946 --> 02:14:37,347
<i>Just let me do it.
Let me do what I do.</i>

1809
02:14:37,516 --> 02:14:41,384
<i>Hey, it fucking involves lying and
I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?</i>

1810
02:14:45,057 --> 02:14:46,615
What?

1811
02:14:50,229 --> 02:14:51,719
What?

1812
02:14:54,033 --> 02:14:56,331
<i>- We got a cop in my crew.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

1813
02:14:56,502 --> 02:15:00,461
<i>- I'm kind of getting that feeling too.
- He's one of yours. Inside.</i>

1814
02:15:00,639 --> 02:15:01,970
<i>- You seen anything?
- Frank.</i>

1815
02:15:02,141 --> 02:15:05,736
<i>I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.</i>

1816
02:15:05,911 --> 02:15:10,473
<i>- I'm doing my...
- You know what, I thought I was the liar.</i>

1817
02:15:10,649 --> 02:15:13,584
Hey, I can explain that!

1818
02:15:18,757 --> 02:15:20,782
Costello recorded everything.

1819
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:25,522
He put all the tapes in a box and kept them
with his lawyer. That was his insurance.

1820
02:15:25,698 --> 02:15:27,188
His lawyer came to me.

1821
02:15:27,366 --> 02:15:29,129
Imagine that, you rat fuck.

1822
02:15:29,301 --> 02:15:31,292
<i>Costello trusted me more than anyone.</i>

1823
02:15:31,971 --> 02:15:35,168
Sound quality good enough?
Because I was a little worried.

1824
02:15:35,674 --> 02:15:38,268
- What do you want?
- I told you I want my identity back...

1825
02:15:38,444 --> 02:15:40,469
...you two-faced faggot.

1826
02:15:40,779 --> 02:15:44,613
- All right, where are you?
- Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.

1827
02:15:44,783 --> 02:15:46,717
You keep your cell on.

1828
02:15:58,831 --> 02:16:00,594
Open the door.

1829
02:16:04,603 --> 02:16:08,596
Open... Didn't we already talk about this?

1830
02:16:09,775 --> 02:16:11,936
This is my job.

1831
02:16:37,202 --> 02:16:39,193
- Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!
- Hey!

1832
02:16:39,371 --> 02:16:40,895
Put the fucking gun down!

1833
02:16:41,073 --> 02:16:44,304
Put the gun down, all right?
I came here to talk some sense into you.

1834
02:16:44,476 --> 02:16:46,034
- Hands!
- Just act professional.

1835
02:16:46,211 --> 02:16:48,236
- I can get you your money.
- What did you say?

1836
02:16:48,414 --> 02:16:52,009
- I can get you your money.
- You didn't come here to talk, all right?

1837
02:16:52,184 --> 02:16:55,153
- You came here to get arrested.
- You got fucking tapes? Of what?

1838
02:16:55,320 --> 02:16:58,812
Costello was my informant.
I was a rat? Fuck you! Prove it.

1839
02:16:58,991 --> 02:17:00,982
He was working for me.
He was my informant.

1840
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:03,025
Shut your fucking mouth.
Come on, get up!

1841
02:17:03,195 --> 02:17:05,595
What is this, a citizen's arrest?
Blow me, all right?

1842
02:17:05,764 --> 02:17:08,597
Only one of us is a cop here, Bill.
You understand that, Bill?

1843
02:17:08,767 --> 02:17:10,667
- No one knows you.
- Shut the fuck up!

1844
02:17:10,836 --> 02:17:14,101
I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts
State Police. Who the fuck are you?

1845
02:17:14,273 --> 02:17:17,401
- I erased you!
- You erased me, huh?

1846
02:17:17,576 --> 02:17:20,238
Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein.
Watch what happens.

1847
02:17:20,412 --> 02:17:22,880
This bullet would
go right through your fucking head!

1848
02:17:23,048 --> 02:17:25,744
- Watch what happens!
- What, so you can get the parade, huh?

1849
02:17:25,918 --> 02:17:30,378
The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you!
Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!

1850
02:17:30,556 --> 02:17:33,320
- That's the stupidest thing you could do.
- Shut the fuck up!

1851
02:17:36,061 --> 02:17:38,291
I could give a fuck
if the charges don't stick.

1852
02:17:38,464 --> 02:17:40,159
I'm still fucking arresting you.

1853
02:17:40,599 --> 02:17:42,499
Get up.

1854
02:17:43,669 --> 02:17:46,695
Drop your weapon and step away
from Sergeant Sullivan.

1855
02:17:46,872 --> 02:17:49,397
I called you. You specifically. Look:

1856
02:17:49,575 --> 02:17:52,942
You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot.
I told you to meet me downstairs.

1857
02:17:53,112 --> 02:17:56,081
Put your weapon on the deck
and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!

1858
02:17:56,248 --> 02:17:58,375
Where's Dignam?
I told you to bring Dignam!

1859
02:17:58,550 --> 02:18:00,780
Shoot this motherfucker!
Would you fucking shoot!

1860
02:18:00,953 --> 02:18:04,650
- Drop your weapon. We'll discuss it.
- Look, he's Costello's rat, all right?

1861
02:18:04,823 --> 02:18:09,487
I got boxes of tapes! Evidence!
Other documents proving it!

1862
02:18:11,897 --> 02:18:13,831
Maybe you do.

1863
02:18:13,999 --> 02:18:16,126
But right now I need you
to drop the weapon!

1864
02:18:16,301 --> 02:18:19,270
I have evidence cold-linking
this prick to Costello, all right?

1865
02:18:19,438 --> 02:18:22,407
- Would you shoot this fucking prick!
- You know who I am.

1866
02:18:22,574 --> 02:18:24,667
- You know who I am.
- Shoot this fucking prick.

1867
02:18:24,843 --> 02:18:27,038
I'm taking him downstairs now.

1868
02:18:30,349 --> 02:18:32,180
You know who I am.

1869
02:18:57,309 --> 02:18:59,174
Shut up.

1870
02:19:00,212 --> 02:19:03,238
I can't wait to see you explain this
to a Suffolk County jury...

1871
02:19:03,415 --> 02:19:04,609
...you fucking cocksucker.

1872
02:19:04,783 --> 02:19:07,308
This is gonna be fucking fun.

1873
02:19:18,463 --> 02:19:20,761
Just fucking kill me.

1874
02:19:22,367 --> 02:19:24,528
Just fucking kill me.

1875
02:19:26,805 --> 02:19:28,864
I am killing you.

1876
02:20:05,077 --> 02:20:07,807
Did you think you were the only one
he had on the inside?

1877
02:20:08,046 --> 02:20:10,344
Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI.

1878
02:20:10,515 --> 02:20:12,210
It's you and me now, you understand?

1879
02:20:12,384 --> 02:20:15,251
We gotta take care of each other,
you understand?

1880
02:20:28,867 --> 02:20:30,459
Give me that.

1881
02:20:45,884 --> 02:20:49,251
<i>Right. Slow. March.</i>

1882
02:20:57,462 --> 02:20:59,657
<i>I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan...</i>

1883
02:20:59,831 --> 02:21:04,359
<i>...at which time he drew down on me,
and I was able to squeeze off one shot...</i>

1884
02:21:04,536 --> 02:21:06,697
<i>...and strike him in the head.</i>

1885
02:21:06,872 --> 02:21:09,306
<i>At that time I immediately
checked the vitals...</i>

1886
02:21:09,474 --> 02:21:11,669
<i>...on both
Troopers Brown and Costigan...</i>

1887
02:21:11,843 --> 02:21:15,006
...and discovered that they had expired.

1888
02:21:18,183 --> 02:21:20,447
I just wanna go on record.

1889
02:21:21,186 --> 02:21:25,145
I'm recommending William Costigan
for the Medal of Merit.

1890
02:21:36,134 --> 02:21:38,466
- Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.
- Ready?

1891
02:21:38,637 --> 02:21:41,538
- And let perpetual light shine upon him.
- Fold.

1892
02:21:41,707 --> 02:21:44,505
May he rest in peace. Amen.

1893
02:21:44,676 --> 02:21:47,008
May his soul and the souls...

1894
02:21:47,179 --> 02:21:52,014
...of all the faithful departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

1895
02:21:52,184 --> 02:21:53,776
Amen.

1896
02:22:23,215 --> 02:22:25,445
Detail. Half left. Face.

1897
02:22:26,818 --> 02:22:28,809
Prepare to fire.

1898
02:22:29,054 --> 02:22:30,681
Fire.

1899
02:22:30,856 --> 02:22:33,347
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1900
02:22:34,259 --> 02:22:37,285
Prepare to fire. Fire.

1901
02:22:37,729 --> 02:22:41,028
Detail. Half right. Face.

1902
02:22:54,446 --> 02:22:56,812
I'll catch up with you guys.

1903
02:23:04,089 --> 02:23:05,920
What about the baby?

1904
02:23:23,642 --> 02:23:25,269
Hi, pup.

1905
02:23:56,808 --> 02:23:58,435
Okay.
