1
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:16,100
I still don't know why I'm here.
Couldn't you just make them say yes?

2
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,600
Yes, I could, but it's not my way.

3
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,500
And I would expect you, of all people, would
understand my feelings on misuse of power.

4
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Ah, power corrupts and all that.
Yes, I know, Charles.

5
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,300
- When are you going to stop lecturing me?
- When you start listening.

6
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,800
You're here because I need you.

7
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,600
We don't have to meet
every one of them in person?

8
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,500
No. This one's special.

9
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,600
What a beautiful campus.
John, don't you think?

10
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,300
Yeah, the brochure is great.

11
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,300
But what about Jean?
What about her illness?

12
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,800
- Illness?
- John.

13
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,100
You think your daughter is sick, Mr. Grey?

14
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:00,100
Perhaps it would be best
if we were to speak to her. Alone.

15
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,600
Of course.

16
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,200
Jean, can you come down, dear?

17
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,300
We'll leave you, then.

18
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:32,400
It's very rude to read my thoughts,
or Mr. Lensherr's, without our permission.

19
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,100
Did you think you were
the only one of your kind, young lady?

20
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,500
We're mutants, Jean. We're like you.

21
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,700
Really? I doubt that.

22
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:02,400
Oh, Charles.

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,600
I like this one.

24
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,200
You have more power
than you can imagine, Jean.

25
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,100
The question is, will you control that power?

26
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,000
Or let it control you?

27
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,800
Warren? Son, is everything all right?

28
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,400
- What's going on?
- Nothing. I'll be right out.

29
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,100
Come on.
You've been in there for over an hour.

30
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,300
Open the door. Warren.

31
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,700
One second!

32
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,000
Open this door.

33
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,800
Warren.

34
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,700
Let me in there right now. Open the door.

35
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,700
Oh, God.

36
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,500
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

37
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,200
- Not you.
- Dad, I'm sorry.

38
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,200
The whole world's going to hell
and you're just going to sit there? Let's go.

39
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,500
Bobby!

40
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,400
Thanks, Kitty.

41
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,600
- We're getting killed out here.
- Yeah, I know. They're not ready, Storm.

42
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,900
- Logan.
- Oh, don't get your panties in a bunch.

43
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,400
That was my last cigar.

44
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,200
Logan.

45
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,800
- It's getting closer.
- Come on. Let's keep moving.

46
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,500
Hey, Tin Man. Come here.

47
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,400
- How's your throwing arm?
- Logan, we work as a team.

48
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Yeah. Good luck with that. Throw me. Now.

49
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,900
Dammit, Logan, don't do this.

50
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,400
Class dismissed.

51
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,800
Hey, Colossus. Nice throw.

52
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,000
Simulation complete.

53
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,700
- What was that?
- Danger room session.

54
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,600
- You know what I mean.
- Lighten up.

55
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,800
You can't change the rules.
I'm trying to teach 'em something.

56
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,000
- I taught 'em something.
- It was a defensive exercise.

57
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,900
Yeah, best defense is a good offence.
Or is it the other way round?

58
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,100
- This isn't a game, Logan.
- Well, you sure fooled me.

59
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,600
Hey, I'm just a sub.
You got a problem, talk to Scott.

60
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,800
- Scott!
- Jean.

61
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,300
Scott. Scott.

62
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,500
Scott.

63
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
Scott.

64
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,000
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

65
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,600
You seem like you're avoiding me.
Something's wrong.

66
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,900
I can't touch my boyfriend without
killing him. Other than that I'm wonderful.

67
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,400
Hey. I don't think that's fair.
Have I ever put any pressure on you?

68
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,100
You're a guy, Bobby.
Your mind's only on one thing.

69
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,100
- They were looking for you. You didn't show.
- What do you care?

70
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,400
- For starters, I had to cover your ass.
- I didn't ask you to.

71
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
No, you didn't. The professor did.

72
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,200
- I was just passing through.
- So pass through, Logan.

73
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
Hey, look.

74
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:07,600
- I know how you feel. When Jean died...
- Don't.

75
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,500
Maybe it's time for us to move on.

76
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,500
Not everybody heals as fast as you, Logan.

77
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,900
- Mr. Secretary.
- Yes.

78
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,400
- The meeting's begun, sir.
- Thank you.

79
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,600
Mr. President.

80
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,800
Have a seat, Hank.

81
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,300
Homeland Security was tracking Magneto.

82
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:07,000
We got hits in Lisbon, Geneva, Montreal.

83
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:12,200
NAVSAT lost him crossing the border,
but we did get a consolation prize.

84
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,000
We picked her up breaking into the FDA.

85
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,600
You know who she's been imitating?
Secretary Trask here.

86
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,700
Yes, sir. She can do that.

87
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,900
- Not any more, she can't. We got her.
- You think your prisons can hold her?

88
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,600
We have some new prisons.
We'll keep them mobile. Be a step ahead.

89
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,000
Where is Magneto?

90
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,700
Raven?

91
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,400
- Raven, I asked you a question.
- I don't answer to my slave name.

92
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Raven Darkholme.
That's your real name, isn't it?

93
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,200
Or has he convinced you
you don't have a family any more?

94
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,400
My family tried to kill me,
you pathetic meat sack.

95
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,400
OK, then. Mystique - where is he?

96
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,200
In here with us.

97
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,300
I don't want to play games with you.
I want answers.

98
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,900
You don't want to play games with me?

99
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,600
You are going to stop this.
Tell me, where is Magneto?

100
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,000
You wanna know where he is?

101
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Homo sapien.

102
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,600
You know, her capture
will only provoke Magneto,

103
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,700
but having her does give us
some diplomatic leverage.

104
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,700
On principle, I can't negotiate
with these people.

105
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,300
- I thought that's why you appointed me, sir.
- Yes, it is.

106
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,900
- But that's not why you called me here.
- No. This is.

107
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,800
It's what she stole from the FDA.

108
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,900
Dear Lord.

109
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,300
- Is it viable?
- We believe it is.

110
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You realize the impact
this'll have on the mutant community?

111
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:16,100
Yes. I do. That's precisely why
we need some of your diplomacy now.

112
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,600
When an individual acquires great power,

113
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,500
the use or misuse of that power is everything.

114
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:33,300
Will it be for the greater good or will it
be used for personal or for destructive ends?

115
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,200
Now, this is a question
we must all ask ourselves.

116
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,900
Why? Because we are mutants.

117
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,900
For psychics,
this presents a particular problem.

118
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,500
When is it acceptable to use our power
and when do we cross that invisible line

119
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,200
that turns us into tyrants
over our fellow man?

120
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,300
But Einstein said that ethics
are an exclusive human concern

121
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,700
without any superhuman authority behind it.

122
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,500
Einstein wasn't a mutant so far as we know.

123
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,600
This case study was sent to me
by a colleague, Dr. Moira McTaggert. Jones.

124
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,600
The man you see here was born
with no higher-level brain functions.

125
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,500
His organs and nervous system work,
but he has no consciousness to speak of.

126
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,400
What if we were to transfer
the consciousness of one person,

127
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,600
say a father of four with terminal cancer,

128
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,200
into the body of this man?

129
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:31,200
How are we to decide what falls within
the range of ethical behavior and what...

130
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,700
Professor?

131
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,900
We'll continue this tomorrow.
Class dismissed.

132
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,600
The forecast was for sunny skies.

133
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,300
I'm sorry.

134
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:19,100
I don't have to be psychic
to see that something's bothering you.

135
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,200
I don't understand. Magneto's a fugitive,

136
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,300
we've a mutant in the cabinet,
a president who understands us - why hide?

137
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,300
We're not hiding. But we still have enemies.
I must protect my students. You know that.

138
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,500
Yes, but we can't be students forever.

139
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,700
Storm, I haven't thought of you
as my student for years.

140
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:43,300
In fact, I thought that perhaps
you might take my place some day.

141
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,700
- But Scott's...
- Scott's a changed man.

142
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,400
He took Jean's death so hard.

143
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,600
Yes, things are better out there,

144
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,800
but you, of all people,
know how fast the weather can change.

145
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,400
There's something you're not telling us.

146
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,300
Hank?

147
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,500
Ororo. Charles.

148
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,100
I love what you've done with your hair.

149
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:25,000
You too. Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

150
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,800
Henry, you are always welcome here.
You're a part of this place.

151
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,100
- I have news.
- Is it Eric?

152
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,300
No. Though we have been making
some progress on that front.

153
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,000
- Mystique was recently apprehended.
- Who's the fur ball?

154
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,600
Hank McCoy. Secretary of Mutant Affairs.

155
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,400
Right, right. The secretary. Nice suit.

156
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,200
- Henry, this is Logan. He's...
- Wolverine.

157
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,700
- I hear you're quite an animal.
- Look who's talking.

158
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
Magneto's gonna come get Mystique.

159
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,800
Magneto's not the problem.
At least not our most pressing one.

160
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,400
A major pharmaceutical company
has developed a mutant antibody.

161
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,400
A way to suppress the mutant X gene.

162
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,600
- Suppress?
- Permanently.

163
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:09,500
They're calling it a cure.

164
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,600
That's ridiculous.
You can't cure being a mutant.

165
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,000
- Scientifically speaking...
- When did we become a disease?

166
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,200
Storm.

167
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,800
They're announcing it now.

168
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,200
These so-called mutants
are people just like us.

169
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,400
Their affliction is nothing more
than a disease,

170
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,500
a corruption of healthy cellular activity.

171
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,000
But I stand here today
to tell you that there's hope.

172
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,300
This site, once the world's
most famous prison,

173
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,400
will now be the source of freedom
for all mutants who choose it.

174
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,700
Ladies and gentlemen...

175
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,000
I proudly present the answer to mutation.

176
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,500
Finally, we have a cure.

177
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,800
Who would want this cure? I mean, what
kind of coward would take it just to fit in?

178
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,300
Is it cowardice to save oneself
from persecution?

179
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,500
Not all of us can fit in so easily.

180
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,500
- You don't shed on the furniture.
- The government probably cooked this up.

181
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,000
- The government had nothing to do with it.
- I've heard that before.

182
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,000
My boy, I have been fighting for mutant rights
since before you had claws.

183
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:32,300
- Did he just call me boy?
- Is it true? They can cure us?

184
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,700
Yes, Rogue. It appears to be true.

185
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,300
No. Professor.

186
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,500
They can't cure us.

187
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:48,700
You wanna know why? Because there's
nothing to cure. Nothing's wrong with you.

188
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,300
Or any of us, for that matter.

189
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,200
How should we, as mutants, respond?
Here's what I think.

190
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:02,400
This is about getting organized.
Bringing our complaints to the right people.

191
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,000
We need to put together a committee
and talk to the government.

192
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,300
They don't understand. They don't know
what it means to be a mutant.

193
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,300
We need to show them, educate them,
let them know that we're here to stay.

194
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,300
People, you must listen.
They won't take us seriously...

195
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,000
- They wanna exterminate us.
- This cure is voluntary.

196
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,600
Nobody is talking about extermination.

197
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,500
No one ever talks about it.

198
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,500
They just do it.

199
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,800
And you'll go on with your lives
ignoring the signs all around you.

200
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:49,600
And then one day, when the air is still
and the night has fallen, they come for you.

201
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,600
Then you realize, while you're talking
about organizing and committees,

202
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,900
the extermination has already begun.

203
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,600
Make no mistake, my brothers.
They will draw first blood.

204
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,700
They will force their cure upon us.

205
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,400
The only question is,
will you join my brotherhood and fight?

206
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,800
Or wait for the inevitable genocide?

207
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,000
Who will you stand with? The humans?

208
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,600
Or us?

209
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,700
You talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape.

210
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,000
Back off.

211
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,400
If you're so proud of being a mutant,
where's your mark?

212
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,000
I have been marked once, my dear.
Let me assure you.

213
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,000
No needle shall ever touch my skin again.

214
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,000
You know who you're talking to?

215
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,100
Do you?

216
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,900
And what can you do?

217
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,200
So you have talents?

218
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,400
That and more. I know you control metal.

219
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,600
And I know there's 87 mutants in here,
none above a class three.

220
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,700
Other than you two.

221
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,700
You can sense other mutants
and their powers?

222
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,600
Could you locate one for me?

223
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,700
Let me out of here.
I demand that you release me.

224
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:45,500
Do you know who I am?
I'm the president of the United States.

225
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,400
Oh, Mr. President.

226
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Shut up.

227
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,400
Why are you doing this to me? Let me down.
I'll be a good girl. Please let me go.

228
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,200
Please.

229
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:03,100
Keep it up. I'll spray you in the face, bitch.

230
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:09,100
When I get out of here,
I'm going to kill you myself.

231
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,200
Yeah, right.

232
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,700
Secretary McCoy,
welcome to Worthington Labs.

233
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,100
Thank you, Dr. Rao.
Not an easy place to get to.

234
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:50,000
It's the safest location we could find. That's
why we keep the source of the cure here.

235
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,500
He is a mutant. You understand our concern.

236
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,200
- We are in compliance with your policy.
- How long will you keep the boy here?

237
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,200
Until we can fully map his DNA.
We can replicate it, but we can't generate it.

238
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,700
And his power? What is its range?

239
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,900
You'll see.

240
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,500
Jimmy.

241
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,200
There's someone I would like you to meet.

242
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,300
Hello there, son.

243
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,400
- Hi.
- My name is Hank McCoy.

244
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,600
I'm sorry.

245
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,600
It's OK.

246
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,400
You have an amazing gift. Thank you, Jimmy.

247
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,500
Extraordinary, isn't he?

248
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,700
Yes, he is.

249
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,600
Scott.

250
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,200
Scott.

251
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,700
Scott.

252
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,900
- Can you hear me? I'm still here. Scott.
- Stop.

253
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,500
- I'm here. Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

254
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,300
- Scott. Scott.
- Stop it.

255
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,900
I need you, Scott. Scott. Scott.

256
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,800
Stop!

257
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Jean?

258
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,800
Scott.

259
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,300
How?

260
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
I don't know.

261
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,100
I wanna see your eyes.

262
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,300
- Take these off.
- No.

263
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
No.

264
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,100
Trust me. I can control it now.

265
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,000
Open them. You can't hurt me.

266
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,700
- What happened?
- No clue.

267
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,500
- Professor, are you OK?
- Get to Alkali Lake.

268
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,300
- You don't want to be here.
- Do you?

269
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,700
I can't see a damn thing.

270
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,200
I can take care of that.

271
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,600
What the...

272
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,000
Logan!

273
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,700
She's alive.

274
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,300
Jean.

275
00:28:54,700 --> 00:29:00,100
The sheer mass of water that collapsed
on top of Jean should have obliterated her.

276
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,400
The only explanation of Jean's survival

277
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:08,300
is that her powers wrapped her
in a cocoon of telekinetic energy.

278
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,100
Is she gonna be OK?

279
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,900
Jean Grey is the only class five mutant
I've ever encountered, her potential limitless.

280
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,700
Her mutation is seated in the unconscious
part of her mind and therein lay the danger.

281
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,300
When she was a girl,
I created a series of psychic barriers

282
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,000
to isolate her powers
from her conscious mind.

283
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:35,100
- Jean developed a dual personality.
- What?

284
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:41,200
The conscious Jean, whose powers were
always in her control, and the dormant side.

285
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:47,400
A personality that, in our sessions,
came to call itself the Phoenix.

286
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:53,800
A purely instinctual creature,
all desire and joy and rage.

287
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,200
- She knew all this?
- It's unclear how much she knew.

288
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:04,500
Far more critical is whether the woman
in front of us is the Jean Grey we know,

289
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:08,100
or the Phoenix furiously struggling to be free.

290
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,100
- She looks peaceful to me.
- I'm keeping her that way.

291
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:16,800
I'm trying to restore the psychic blocks
and cage the beast again.

292
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,200
What have you done to her?

293
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,800
- You have to understand...
- You're talking about a person's mind.

294
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
- She has to be controlled.
- Controlled?

295
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:29,500
Sometimes, when you cage the beast,
the beast gets angry.

296
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,800
You have no idea.
You have no idea of what she is capable.

297
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,900
No, Professor.
I had no idea what you were capable of.

298
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,800
I had a terrible choice to make.
I chose the lesser of two evils.

299
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,800
It sounds to me like Jean had no choice at all.

300
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:49,200
I don't have to explain myself,
least of all to you.

301
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,900
History will be made here today.
For the first time,

302
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,400
the so-called mutant cure
will be available to the public.

303
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,800
Reaction has run the gamut
with mutants on both sides of the line.

304
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:13,100
Some are desperate for this cure while others
are offended by the very idea of it.

305
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,500
Will Secretary McCoy be a problem?

306
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,800
Hard to say. His political views seem
somewhat at odds with his personal issues.

307
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,900
Excuse me, sir. Your son's arrived.

308
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,600
Good. Bring him in.

309
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,900
Are you sure you want to start with him?

310
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,500
I think it's important. Yes.

311
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,400
- Hello, Warren.
- How are you, son?

312
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,000
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

313
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,900
You know, I'm proud of you for doing this.

314
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,600
Everything's gonna be fine. I promise.

315
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,200
You ready?

316
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:34,400
The transformation can be a little jarring.

317
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,100
- Dad, can we talk about this for a second?
- We've talked about it, son.

318
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,200
It'll all be over soon.

319
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:51,200
- Everything's going to be fine.
- Wait. I can't do this.

320
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,200
Warren, calm down.

321
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,400
- I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

322
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,600
- I can't do this.
- Just relax, son. Take it easy. Calm down.

323
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,500
- I promise you it will be fine. Warren, relax.
- Dad.

324
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,700
Warren, it's a better life.

325
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,400
- It's what we all want.
- No.

326
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,900
It's what you want.

327
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,400
Warren, no!

328
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Told you so.

329
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,300
About time.

330
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,900
I've been busy.
Did you find what you were looking for?

331
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,800
The source of the cure is a mutant.
A child at Worthington Labs.

332
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,600
Without him, they have nothing.

333
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
Read off the guest list.

334
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:15,200
"Cell 41205. James Madrox."

335
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,400
This one robbed seven banks.

336
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,400
- At the same time.
- I could use a man of your talents.

337
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,200
- I'm in.
- Welcome to the Brotherhood.

338
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,900
- Careful with this one.
- "Cain Marko. Solitary confinement."

339
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,900
Check this out.
"Prisoner must be confined at all times."

340
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,500
"If he builds any momentum,
no object can stop him."

341
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,200
How fascinating.

342
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,600
- What do they call you?
- Juggernaut.

343
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:57,800
- I can't imagine why.
- Are you going to let me out? I need a pee.

344
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,800
- Nice helmet.
- Keeps my face pretty.

345
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,100
I think he'll make a fine addition to our army.

346
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,200
No!

347
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,600
You saved me.

348
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,200
Eric.

349
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,200
I'm sorry, my dear.

350
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,000
You're not one of us any more.

351
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,600
Such a shame. She was so beautiful.

352
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:19,700
Think resigning will make a difference?
That's no way to influence policy.

353
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,400
Policy is being made without me,
Mr. President.

354
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,600
The decision to turn the cure into a weapon
was made without me.

355
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,500
What happened on that convoy
was inexcusable. But your actions...

356
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,800
That was an isolated incident. You have to
understand those mutants were a real threat.

357
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,200
Have you even begun to think
what a slippery slope you're on?

358
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,500
I have.

359
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:48,100
And I worry about how democracy survives
when one man can move cities with his mind.

360
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,300
As do I.

361
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,200
You and I know
that it's only going to get worse.

362
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,600
All the more reason
why I need to be where I belong.

363
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,100
Jean.

364
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,400
- Hi, Logan.
- Welcome back.

365
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,300
Back where we first met. Only I was
in your place and you were in mine.

366
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,100
Are you OK?

367
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,900
Yeah.

368
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,100
More than OK.

369
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:12,000
Logan, you're making me blush.

370
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,600
- You're reading my thoughts?
- I don't have to.

371
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,200
It's OK.

372
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,600
It's OK.

373
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,900
- Wait.
- No.

374
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,000
Jean.

375
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,200
- This isn't you.
- Yes, it is me.

376
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,200
No. Maybe you ought to take it easy.

377
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:39,500
The professor said you might be different.

378
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,800
He would know, wouldn't he?

379
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,700
What? You think he's not in your head too?

380
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,300
Look at you, Logan. He's tamed you.

381
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,800
Where's Scott?

382
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,200
Jean?

383
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,600
- Where am I?
- You're in the mansion.

384
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,200
You need to tell me what happened to Scott.

385
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,700
Jean, tell me what happened to him.

386
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,300
Oh, God.

387
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,500
Look at me.

388
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,500
Stay with me. Talk to me.

389
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,400
- Look at me. Look at me.
- No.

390
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,400
Focus. Focus, Jean.

391
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,900
Kill me.

392
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,800
- What?
- Kill me before I kill someone else.

393
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,500
- Don't say that.
- Please.

394
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,200
- Stop it.
- Kill me.

395
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,600
Stop it. Look at me. Look at me. Jean.

396
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,400
It'll be all right. We can help you.

397
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Hey. The professor can help. He can fix it.

398
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,100
I don't want to fix it.

399
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,000
Voluntary? They put the cure in a gun.

400
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,700
I told you they would draw first blood.

401
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,400
- So what do we do?
- What do we do?

402
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:44,400
We use this weapon as a lightning rod
to bring countless more to our cause.

403
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,600
Come. We have an army to build.

404
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,000
I picked something up.

405
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,200
An electromagnetic force. It's massive.

406
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,900
It's a mutant.

407
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,100
Class five.
More powerful than anything I've ever felt.

408
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,500
More powerful than you.

409
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,400
Where is she?

410
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,500
Logan.

411
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,700
- Jean. Jean.
- What happened?

412
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,900
What have you done?

413
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:27,300
- I think she killed Scott.
- What?

414
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,400
- That's not possible.
- I warned you.

415
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,200
She's left the mansion, but she's trying
to block my thoughts. She's so strong.

416
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,300
It may be too late.

417
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,900
- Wait for me here.
- What?

418
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I need to see Jean alone.

419
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,000
You were right, Charles.

420
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,500
- This one is special.
- What the hell are you doing here?

421
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,600
Same as the professor. Visiting an old friend.

422
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,900
- I don't want trouble here.
- Nor do I.

423
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,100
So, shall we go inside?

424
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,900
I came to bring Jean home. Don't interfere.

425
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:20,100
- Just like old times, eh?
- She needs help. Jean is not well.

426
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:24,000
Funny, you sound just like her parents.

427
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:26,200
Nobody gets inside.

428
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,500
- I knew you'd come.
- Of course. I've come to bring you home.

429
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,500
- I have no home.
- Yes, you do. You have a home and a family.

430
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:24,100
You know he thinks your power
is too great for you to control.

431
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,100
I don't believe your mind games
are going to work any more, Charles.

432
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,100
- So you want to control me?
- He does.

433
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,300
No. I want to help you.

434
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,600
Help me? What's wrong with me?

435
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,600
- Absolutely nothing.
- Eric, stop.

436
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,700
No, Charles, not this time.
You've always held her back.

437
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,300
For your own good, Jean.

438
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,400
Stay out of my head.

439
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,200
- I'm going in.
- The professor said he'd handle this.

440
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,400
Look at me, Jean. I can help you. Look at me.

441
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,500
Get out of my head.

442
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,100
- Perhaps you should listen to her, Charles.
- Trust me. You're a danger to everyone.

443
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:17,500
- But I can help you.
- I think you want to give her the cure.

444
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,800
Look at Scott. You killed the man you loved
because you couldn't control your power.

445
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,300
No! Stop it!

446
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,100
That's it.

447
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:13,500
Jean, let me in.

448
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,800
No, Jean.

449
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Jean!

450
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,200
Don't let it control you.

451
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,000
Charles.

452
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,600
My dear. Come with me.

453
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,300
No.

454
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,200
God!

455
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,200
We live in an age of darkness.

456
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:06,100
A world full of fear, hate and intolerance.

457
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,200
But in every age,
there are those who fight against it.

458
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:15,100
Charles Xavier was born to a world divided.

459
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,100
A world he tried to heal.

460
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:23,000
A mission he never saw accomplished.

461
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:28,800
It seems the destiny of great men
to see their goals unfulfilled.

462
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:34,200
Charles was more than a leader,
more than a teacher. He was a friend.

463
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,900
When we were afraid, he gave us strength.

464
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,900
And when we were alone, he gave us a family.

465
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:50,100
He may be gone, but his teachings
live on through us, his students.

466
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,700
Wherever we may go,
we must carry on his vision.

467
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:57,700
And that's a vision of a world united.

468
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,800
Kitty.

469
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,800
Bobby.

470
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,800
- You OK?
- Yeah.

471
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:40,000
It's just... Xavier came to my house.

472
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,300
He was the one that convinced me
to come here.

473
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,400
Yeah, me too.

474
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:50,700
- We're all feeling the same way, you know.
- No, Bobby, we're not.

475
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,000
You have Rogue and I have...

476
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,100
You know, I just miss home.

477
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,000
The first snow and all that.

478
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:06,900
- Kitty, get up. Come with me.
- Storm told us to stay in our rooms.

479
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,500
Don't worry. We won't get caught.

480
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,200
I mean, you can
walk through walls, you know.

481
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,100
Come on.

482
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:28,200
This place can be home too.

483
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,500
Thank you for this, Bobby.

484
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,900
You need a lift, kid?

485
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,100
No.

486
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:35,200
Where are you going?

487
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:41,400
You don't know what it's like to be afraid of
your powers, afraid to get close to anybody.

488
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:43,900
Yeah, I do.

489
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,700
I want to be able to touch people, Logan.

490
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,300
A hug. A handshake.

491
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,300
A kiss.

492
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:58,000
I hope you're not doing this for some boy.

493
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,200
Look, if you wanna go, then go.

494
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,700
Just be sure it's what you want.

495
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,900
Shouldn't you be telling me to stay?

496
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,100
To go upstairs and unpack?

497
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,400
I'm not your father. I'm your friend.

498
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,600
Just think about what I said, Rogue.

499
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,300
Marie.

500
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,700
Marie.

501
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:09,900
Remember when we first met? Do you know
what I saw when I looked at you?

502
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:16,100
I saw the next stage in evolution
both Charles and I dreamt of finding.

503
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:24,000
And I thought to myself, "Why would Charles
want to turn this goddess into a mortal?"

504
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,300
I can manipulate the metal in this,

505
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,900
but you, you can do anything.

506
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,300
Anything you can think of.

507
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,000
Jean.

508
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,200
Enough.

509
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,700
Enough.

510
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,300
You sound just like him.

511
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,300
Jean, he wanted to hold you back.

512
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:08,500
- What do you want?
- I want you to be what you are.

513
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,600
As nature intended.

514
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:19,500
That cure is meant for all of us.
If we want freedom, we must fight for it.

515
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:23,100
And that fight begins now.

516
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,500
She shouldn't be here with us.

517
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,300
- Her power is completely unstable.
- Only in the wrong hands.

518
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:41,900
- And you trust her? She's one of them.
- So were you once.

519
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:47,900
I stuck with you. Would have killed
the professor if you'd given me the chance.

520
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,100
Charles Xavier did more for mutants
than you'll ever know.

521
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:58,000
My single greatest regret
is that he had to die for our dream to live.

522
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,800
So what now? What do we do?

523
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,500
Xavier started this school.
Perhaps it's best that it end with him.

524
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:26,500
- We'll tell the students they're going home.
- Most of us don't have anywhere to go.

525
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:32,400
I can't believe this. I can't believe
we're not going to fight for this school.

526
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,100
I'm sorry. I know this is a bad time.

527
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,600
I was told that this was
a safe place for mutants.

528
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,700
It was, son.

529
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,600
And it still is. We'll find you a room.

530
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:58,600
Hank, tell all the students
the school stays open.

531
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:14,800
Rogue.

532
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:17,800
Hey, Rogue.

533
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:31,200
- Hey, Pete. Have you seen Rogue?
- Yeah, she took off.

534
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,800
Logan.

535
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,500
Logan.

536
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,400
- Logan.
- Jean?

537
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,300
Logan. Where am I? Logan.

538
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,300
Logan. Logan.

539
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:57,800
- Logan.
- Stop.

540
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,200
Logan. Logan. Logan.

541
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,800
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

542
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:27,700
- She's gone, Logan. She's not coming back.
- You don't know that.

543
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,300
She killed the professor.

544
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,700
It wasn't Jean.
The Jean I know is still in there.

545
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,000
Listen, why can't you see the truth?

546
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:41,800
- Why can't you just let her go?
- Because... because...

547
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:44,000
Because you love her.

548
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,600
She made her choice.
Now it's time we make ours.

549
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,900
So if you're with us, then be with us.

550
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:16,200
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

551
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,800
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

552
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,800
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

553
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:26,900
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

554
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,600
Getting the cure so you can go back home
to mommy and daddy?

555
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:36,400
I'm looking for someone.

556
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,600
Oh, I get it. Your girlfriend.

557
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I figured she'd want the cure. She's pathetic.

558
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,200
Come on, Iceman.

559
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Make a move.

560
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:05,100
Same old Bobby. Still afraid of a fight.

561
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,600
Today's attack was only our first salvo.

562
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:24,600
So long as the cure exists, our war will rage.

563
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:31,100
Your cities will not be safe. Your streets
will not be safe. You will not be safe.

564
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,100
And to my fellow mutants,
I make you this offer...

565
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,000
Join us or stay out of our way.

566
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:42,100
Enough mutant blood
has been spilled already.

567
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:48,100
We're trying to track them, sir.
We're working hard.

568
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:53,100
- We cannot let him do this.
- You know I agree, sir.

569
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,300
This is now a national security matter.
Seize and secure Worthington Labs.

570
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,100
I want troops armed with cure weapons
deployed immediately.

571
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:07,400
And Trask, you have to find Magneto
and stop him by any means necessary.

572
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,700
Magneto wants a war. We'll give him one.

573
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,500
Let's go. Keep it moving.

574
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:17,200
Turn in your old weapon. Turn in all metal.

575
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:20,900
Bayonets, magazines, dog tags.

576
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:25,100
Pick up your plastic weapons.
Pick up your cure cartridge.

577
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,300
Absolutely no metal.

578
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:41,800
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

579
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:46,700
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

580
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:53,100
We don't need a cure! We don't need a cure!

581
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:16,600
They wish to cure us.
But I say to you we are the cure.

582
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:24,900
The cure for that infirm, imperfect condition
called homo sapiens.

583
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,100
They have their weapons.

584
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,100
We have ours.

585
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:40,600
We will strike with a vengeance and a fury
that this world has never witnessed.

586
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:48,300
And if any mutants stand in our way,
we will use this poison against them.

587
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,700
We shall go to Alcatraz Island,

588
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,000
take control of the cure,

589
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:56,500
and destroy its source.

590
01:06:56,600 --> 01:07:00,300
And then nothing can stop us.

591
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,300
Jean.

592
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:33,000
I know the smell of your domatium
from a mile away.

593
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:36,000
- I didn't come here to fight you.
- Smart boy.

594
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:41,700
- I came for Jean.
- You think I'm keeping her against her will?

595
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:54,300
- She's here because she wants to be.
- You don't know what you're dealing with.

596
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,000
I know full well.
I saw what she did to Charles.

597
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:01,700
And you stood there and let him die?

598
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,400
- I'm not leaving here without her.
- Yes, you are.

599
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,900
OK.

600
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:25,600
Two minutes till rendezvous, Mr. President.

601
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:31,700
We have a satellite feed
of Magneto's base of operations.

602
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:38,300
- How did we find it?
- She gave us everything we wanted.

603
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,800
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

604
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:21,500
Approaching target dead ahead.

605
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,100
Set for 360-degree incursion.

606
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:40,200
This is Team Leader to Bravo One.
We are green to go.

607
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:46,900
OK, send them in.

608
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:48,200
OK.

609
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:52,700
Freeze, mutants!
Get your hands in the air! Hands in the air!

610
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,900
OK. I give up.

611
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:13,200
Sorry, Mr. Secretary, it was a decoy.

612
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:16,300
If he's not there, then where the hell is he?

613
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:28,700
Worthington Labs. It ends where it began.

614
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,100
- Are you sure the boy is still inside?
- 100%.

615
01:10:32,200 --> 01:10:36,000
So how are we supposed to get there?
'Cause I don't swim.

616
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,700
Leave that to me.

617
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:46,900
Storm. Storm.

618
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,800
What are you doing back here?

619
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:51,900
I need help.

620
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,800
- You found her.
- Yeah. She's with Magneto.

621
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,800
- Where are they?
- On the move. I know where they're going.

622
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:03,200
- You're saying you saw Magneto?
- We gotta go. They're gonna attack Alcatraz.

623
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:06,800
- There are troops stationed on that island.
- Not enough to stop him.

624
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,900
Let's suit up.

625
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:17,200
- Hard to believe this once fit me.
- If Magneto gets that cure, we can't stop him.

626
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:20,300
- Can you estimate how many he has?
- An army. And Jean.

627
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:26,100
- His powers have limits, hers do not.
- There's only six of us, Logan.

628
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:30,200
Yeah. We're outnumbered.

629
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,800
I'm not gonna lie to you.

630
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:35,300
But we lost Scott.

631
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,500
We lost the professor.

632
01:11:37,700 --> 01:11:42,600
If we don't fight now,
everything they stood for will die with them.

633
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,500
I'm not gonna let that happen.

634
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,700
Are you?

635
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,900
Then we stand together.

636
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,600
X-Men.

637
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:56,700
All of us.

638
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:05,600
We're in.

639
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,800
Let's go.

640
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:14,800
- They're ready.
- Yeah, I know.

641
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:21,100
But are you ready to do what you need to do
when the time comes?

642
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,700
Dad, what's going on?

643
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
It's an earthquake.

644
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,100
We're trapped.

645
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:07,200
Charles always wanted to build bridges.

646
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,600
My God.

647
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:52,600
Fall back! Take cover! Fall back!

648
01:17:08,100 --> 01:17:12,000
The boy's in the southeast corner
of the building.

649
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,500
- Well, then.
- Let's take it down!

650
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:35,200
In chess, the pawns go first.

651
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,400
Humans and their guns.

652
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:52,100
Plastic. They've learned.

653
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:01,100
That's why the pawns go first.

654
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,400
Target the bridge.

655
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,800
Fire!

656
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:33,300
Arclight, use your shockwaves.
Target those weapons.

657
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:57,400
- Oh, my stars and garters.
- Go into stealth mode.

658
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:03,800
- What about jets? Tanks?
- Against Magneto? He'll turn them inside out.

659
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:07,700
- Where are our ground troops?
- 30 minutes away.

660
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:10,600
Then God help us.

661
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:22,500
They're coming for him.

662
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,500
Don't ever do that again.

663
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,500
You men cover the doors!

664
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,800
Everybody get together! And hold this line!

665
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,400
Traitors to their own cause.

666
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,100
Finish them!

667
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,100
Not yet.

668
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:32,600
Go inside and get the boy. And kill him.

669
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:34,700
With pleasure.

670
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:43,200
Hold it!

671
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:47,100
He's going for the boy!

672
01:21:47,200 --> 01:21:49,500
Not if I get there first.

673
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,700
Kitty!

674
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,100
Come on.

675
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,100
Grow those back.

676
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:21,800
Don't you know who I am?

677
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:25,400
I'm the Juggernaut, bitch.

678
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:59,400
Going somewhere?

679
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:05,500
You're the guy that invented the cure, right?

680
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:07,700
Yes, I am.

681
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,300
Girls.

682
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,700
No. Don't. Don't hurt him.

683
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:16,000
- No. Don't hurt him.
- Let go of me. I didn't do anything.

684
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:18,400
Calm down. Calm down.

685
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:20,700
Everything's gonna be OK.

686
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:44,700
- I thought you were a diplomat.
- As Churchill said, "There comes a time..."

687
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:47,400
Oh, you get the point.

688
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,700
Oh, no. Please, no, no, don't.

689
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,000
No.

690
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:02,900
No, don't worry. I'm here to help you.
I'm going to get you out of here.

691
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:06,600
This way.

692
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:11,700
- Oh, my God. What's going on?
- Your powers won't work with me.

693
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:17,800
- Stay close, all right?
- OK.

694
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,400
I'm the wrong guy to play hide-and-seek with.

695
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,100
Who's hiding, dickhead?

696
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:39,400
Don't. No.

697
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:42,000
Don't.

698
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:46,100
Please, don't do this.
I only wanted to help you people.

699
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,100
Do we look like we need your help?

700
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:21,300
It's time to end this war.

701
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:35,000
Take cover.

702
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,400
Get out of the way.

703
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:53,300
- Let's go, let's go.
- Move.

704
01:25:53,400 --> 01:25:55,000
Go! Go! Go!

705
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,500
We work as a team.

706
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:49,600
Best defense is a good offence.

707
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:59,300
Bobby, think you can take out
your old friend?

708
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:13,700
Go ahead.

709
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:17,400
Storm, we're gonna need some cover.

710
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,600
Right.

711
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,300
You're in over your head, Bobby.

712
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:14,300
Maybe you should go back to school.

713
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:27,500
You never should have left.

714
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:30,800
This is it.

715
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
Hey.

716
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:36,000
Make it a strike.

717
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:49,200
You never learn, do you?

718
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:54,300
Actually, I do.

719
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,000
I'm...

720
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:12,800
One of them?

721
01:29:22,900 --> 01:29:26,200
This is what they want for all of us.

722
01:29:47,200 --> 01:29:49,100
It's over, Jean.

723
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,700
It's over.

724
01:29:56,900 --> 01:29:58,900
No! Don't shoot!

725
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,700
No!

726
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,900
Everybody get out of there!

727
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,400
Bobby!

728
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,600
What have I done?

729
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:11,700
I'm the only one who can stop her.
Get everyone to safety.

730
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:14,300
Go.

731
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:19,600
Jean!

732
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:06,900
Jean!

733
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:09,500
I know you're still there!

734
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,600
You would die for them?

735
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,800
No, not for them.

736
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
For you.

737
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:09,000
For you.

738
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:16,100
Save me.

739
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,700
I love you.

740
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,600
You're back.

741
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,500
I'm sorry.

742
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,600
I had to.

743
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:16,500
- This isn't what I wanted.
- I know.

744
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,100
It's what I want.

745
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:34,000
Hey.

746
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:37,200
Good to see you, buddy.

747
01:35:37,300 --> 01:35:40,000
With the thanks of a grateful nation

748
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:43,200
I introduce our new ambassador
to the United Nations,

749
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:47,600
and the representative to the world
for all United States citizens,

750
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:50,500
human and mutant alike,

751
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:52,700
Dr. Hank McCoy.

752
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:58,100
Way to go, fur ball.

753
01:43:46,700 --> 01:43:48,700
Morning.

754
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:55,900
Hello, Moira.

755
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:03,900
Charles.

756
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:09,000
