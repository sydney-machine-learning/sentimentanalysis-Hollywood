1
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,298
Break!

2
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:42,633
Let's move it.
Let's go.

3
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:43,634
Hut!

4
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:44,768
20!

5
00:00:44,802 --> 00:00:46,203
29!

6
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,188
All right.
You take the inside.

7
00:01:05,222 --> 00:01:08,158
On this one,
you take the inside.

8
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:09,292
54.

9
00:01:09,326 --> 00:01:11,629
Ready, set...

10
00:01:11,662 --> 00:01:13,030
2-85!

11
00:01:13,063 --> 00:01:15,032
2-85!

12
00:01:15,065 --> 00:01:16,634
Hut! Hut!

13
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:18,301
Back! Back!

14
00:01:18,335 --> 00:01:19,302
Throw! Throw!

15
00:01:19,336 --> 00:01:20,904
Throw the ball!

16
00:01:20,938 --> 00:01:22,640
Touchdown, Joe.

17
00:01:22,673 --> 00:01:23,774
Looking good,
isn't he?

18
00:01:23,807 --> 00:01:24,775
What?

19
00:01:24,808 --> 00:01:25,776
Pendleton.

20
00:01:25,809 --> 00:01:28,779
He's looking
awful good.

21
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:30,047
Mm-hmm.

22
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,314
Really fall into it.

23
00:01:31,348 --> 00:01:33,383
All right, Joe.
Come on, baby.

24
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,018
Set...

25
00:01:35,052 --> 00:01:35,953
Hike!

26
00:01:35,986 --> 00:01:37,154
Good movement.

27
00:01:37,187 --> 00:01:40,624
Let's try it again.
Let's try it again.

28
00:01:40,658 --> 00:01:41,625
18...

29
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:43,727
Hike. Hike.

30
00:01:46,664 --> 00:01:48,298
Have those men
go deep.

31
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:50,333
1-83!

32
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:52,770
1-83!

33
00:01:52,803 --> 00:01:53,904
Hut!

34
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,008
He's looking
awful good.

35
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,777
Here we go.

36
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,745
Hut! Hut!

37
00:02:06,083 --> 00:02:07,651
Hustle back,
hustle back.

38
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:09,753
Come on, guys. Come on.

39
00:02:14,157 --> 00:02:18,261
Opposite left,
play past 35. X-curl on 1.

40
00:02:18,295 --> 00:02:19,797
Ready? Break.

41
00:02:21,899 --> 00:02:24,001
4-3, set!

42
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:25,402
Play past 29...

43
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:27,404
2-81!

44
00:02:27,437 --> 00:02:29,006
2-81!

45
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:31,141
Hut! Hut!

46
00:02:31,174 --> 00:02:33,410
Pass! Pass! Pass!

47
00:02:34,444 --> 00:02:36,013
Ball! Ball! Ball!

48
00:02:36,046 --> 00:02:39,282
Once again, we had
a foul-up on that scrimmage.

49
00:02:39,316 --> 00:02:41,785
The fullback has been
slow on his block.

50
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,287
The guard almost ran
into that pole.

51
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:46,289
We got to do it
till it's right.

52
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:49,159
Formation left.
Screen right on 2.

53
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:50,694
Ready? Break!

54
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,897
Right, left!

55
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:55,132
Right, left!

56
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:57,434
4-3...

57
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:59,302
Set!

58
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:00,904
2-85!

59
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:02,439
2-85!

60
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:04,742
Hut! Hut!

61
00:03:10,013 --> 00:03:11,414
Looking
awful good.

62
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:12,850
Mm-hmm.

63
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:17,254
I'm thinking of
starting him on Sunday.

64
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:21,024
What about Jarrett?

65
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:22,492
Pendleton's
looking better.

66
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:24,027
2-81!

67
00:03:24,061 --> 00:03:25,028
Hut!

68
00:03:25,062 --> 00:03:26,029
Hut!

69
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:29,032
Pass!
Pass! Pass!

70
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:30,400
Ball! Ball! Ball!

71
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:31,434
Come on!

72
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:32,870
Is he still
on cortisone?

73
00:03:32,903 --> 00:03:34,137
No.

74
00:03:34,171 --> 00:03:37,040
Darvon, xylocaine,
any kind of painkiller?

75
00:03:37,074 --> 00:03:38,041
Nothing.

76
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:39,777
He's looking
awful good.

77
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,444
2-84!

78
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:44,047
Hut! Hut! Hut!

79
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:46,049
Hut!

80
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,751
Ball! Ball! Ball!

81
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:50,053
I never saw
a knee like that

82
00:03:50,087 --> 00:03:51,454
heal without
surgery, coach.

83
00:03:51,488 --> 00:03:54,057
He's looking awful good.

84
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:55,458
Thanks a lot.

85
00:03:55,492 --> 00:03:56,794
Oh, hi, Joe.

86
00:03:56,827 --> 00:03:57,928
How you doing?

87
00:03:57,961 --> 00:03:58,962
Good. How's the knee?

88
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:00,163
Good.

89
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:03,066
What do you think
of the rams' chances?

90
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,002
I think we're going
to the super bowl.

91
00:04:05,035 --> 00:04:06,203
We're going to win.

92
00:04:06,236 --> 00:04:08,471
Off the record.
Think you got a chance?

93
00:04:08,505 --> 00:04:11,441
Off the record? We're
going to the super bowl.

94
00:04:11,474 --> 00:04:12,810
We're going to win.

95
00:04:12,843 --> 00:04:15,478
What do you think
of your competition?

96
00:04:15,512 --> 00:04:17,480
Jarrett.
My competition?

97
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:19,082
He's our
starting quarterback.

98
00:04:19,116 --> 00:04:20,450
My competition's
25 other teams.

99
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:37,400
Ha ha ha ha.

100
00:04:49,512 --> 00:04:50,814
Max?

101
00:04:50,848 --> 00:04:52,449
Whew! Yeah!

102
00:04:52,482 --> 00:04:54,051
How you doing?

103
00:04:54,084 --> 00:04:56,053
What's in
this brown stuff?

104
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:58,155
Oh, that's mainly
whipped liver.

105
00:04:58,188 --> 00:04:59,189
Liver?

106
00:04:59,222 --> 00:05:02,059
Yep. I put
a little whey in it,

107
00:05:02,092 --> 00:05:05,462
then mix it with a
little alfalfa sprouts,

108
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:09,266
some bean curd,
and spinach mold.

109
00:05:09,299 --> 00:05:12,469
It's a--it's a liver
and whey shake.

110
00:05:13,636 --> 00:05:15,605
* happy birthday to you

111
00:05:15,638 --> 00:05:17,875
* happy birthday
to you *

112
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:21,078
* happy birthday,
dear Joe *

113
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:23,480
* happy birthday
to you *

114
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:25,482
I didn't think
anybody knew.

115
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:27,484
Thanks for
coming over, Max.

116
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:30,487
I hope you have
a lot more, kid.

117
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,089
That's--that's--
that's--

118
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:33,290
aw...

119
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:35,358
What's this?

120
00:05:35,392 --> 00:05:36,894
Aw.

121
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:40,097
Ahem.

122
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:43,500
Yay! Ha ha ha!

123
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:45,102
You want
to know something?

124
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:48,505
At my age, in any other
business, I'd be young.

125
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:50,107
Look at it
this way--

126
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,509
soon you can get
into another business

127
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:54,511
and have a real life.

128
00:05:54,544 --> 00:05:55,512
Yeah?

129
00:05:55,545 --> 00:05:57,114
Yeah.

130
00:05:57,147 --> 00:05:59,516
I don't know
what that means.

131
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:02,519
This is the only
business I know.

132
00:06:02,552 --> 00:06:03,520
I'm stuck.

133
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:05,122
What do you mean,
stuck?

134
00:06:05,155 --> 00:06:07,524
I've been working
my whole life

135
00:06:07,557 --> 00:06:10,527
to get a chance
to do something, and...

136
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,130
I don't know
if I'm ever

137
00:06:13,163 --> 00:06:15,132
going to get
a chance to do it.

138
00:06:15,165 --> 00:06:16,133
Hey.

139
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,534
No, it's all right.

140
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,536
I'm going
to fix your neck.

141
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:21,138
Don't do that, Joe.

142
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,439
Wait a minute. Wait.

143
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:23,907
Oh!

144
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:24,908
How's that?

145
00:06:24,942 --> 00:06:26,076
Oh, boy. Yeah,

146
00:06:26,109 --> 00:06:28,478
but it scares
the hell out of me

147
00:06:28,511 --> 00:06:30,080
every time you do that.

148
00:06:30,113 --> 00:06:32,482
If you don't pay
more attention to how

149
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:35,485
your trapezius goes up
into your deltoids,

150
00:06:35,518 --> 00:06:37,487
you're going to throw
off your entire cervical

151
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,089
and your lumbar areas.

152
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:41,091
Only I can fix it.

153
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:43,493
You ought to start
listening to me.

154
00:06:43,526 --> 00:06:45,495
Maybe you ought
to trade places.

155
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:47,297
You be the trainer.
I'll start on Sunday.

156
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,932
Yeah...what?

157
00:06:52,135 --> 00:06:54,637
I'm starting
against Dallas?

158
00:06:54,671 --> 00:06:57,240
They don't want
to go with Jarrett.

159
00:06:57,274 --> 00:06:59,977
They want
to go with you.

160
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,079
Happy birthday, Joe.

161
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:11,174
Hey, my watch stopped.
Look at that.

162
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,476
It keeps flashing
the same time.

163
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:16,179
I'm dreaming, huh?

164
00:09:22,619 --> 00:09:25,455
Well, I...

165
00:09:25,488 --> 00:09:27,590
Hey...

166
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:29,592
This is
an airplane dream.

167
00:09:29,626 --> 00:09:32,195
I forget what they're
supposed to mean.

168
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:35,298
I think they're a good sign,
aren't they?

169
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:38,601
Mr. Pendleton.

170
00:09:38,635 --> 00:09:40,270
Mr. Pendleton,
you must wait for me.

171
00:09:40,303 --> 00:09:42,405
I'm your escort.

172
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:47,644
Wait for me, please,
Mr. Pendleton.

173
00:09:51,581 --> 00:09:54,151
The end of the line,
Mr. Pendleton, please.

174
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:55,552
Hi. How you doing?

175
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:58,555
Hey, you want to
hear a little music?

176
00:09:58,588 --> 00:10:00,557
You have to wait in line.

177
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,160
What? This is
my dream, isn't it?

178
00:10:03,193 --> 00:10:05,828
You mustn't get out
of line. Really!

179
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:07,430
Chamberlain,
Paul r.

180
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:10,433
All right. I think
I've brought the, uh...

181
00:10:10,467 --> 00:10:11,868
I've escorted
the final--

182
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:13,636
asterisk this manifest
as complete.

183
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,871
Hi.

184
00:10:14,904 --> 00:10:17,174
You cannot board
before your turn.

185
00:10:17,207 --> 00:10:19,576
I don't need a turn.
I'm not boarding.

186
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:21,178
I don't think
you understand.

187
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:22,545
This isn't your
ultimate destination.

188
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:24,247
This is a way station.

189
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:26,583
That will take you to your
ultimate destination.

190
00:10:26,616 --> 00:10:28,185
I'm not going.

191
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:31,188
I'm going to run
around till I wake up.

192
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:33,590
I'm afraid I haven't
fully explained the basis

193
00:10:33,623 --> 00:10:35,425
on which this system
is organized.

194
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,594
This way station's rules
derived from yours.

195
00:10:37,627 --> 00:10:39,596
They're a product
of your image

196
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:42,199
and the image of those
who share your image.

197
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:43,800
Violate the rules,
question the principles--

198
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:46,303
you want to see a trick?

199
00:10:46,336 --> 00:10:48,705
I do this
once in a while

200
00:10:48,738 --> 00:10:50,607
to keep my abductor
pollicis limber.

201
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,209
You want to feel that?

202
00:10:52,242 --> 00:10:55,212
That's a perfectly solid
50-cent piece.

203
00:10:55,245 --> 00:10:58,215
I just throw that
into that hand, you see.

204
00:10:58,248 --> 00:11:01,618
I say the magic words,
abracadabra.

205
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:03,720
And then presto,
it's gone.

206
00:11:03,753 --> 00:11:07,657
You probably think
I still have it.

207
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:09,259
You're wrong,

208
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:11,794
'cause I can see it
coming out of your ear.

209
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:14,531
That's
the only trick I know.

210
00:11:15,998 --> 00:11:17,967
Mr. Pendleton!

211
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,802
Gentlemen.

212
00:11:19,836 --> 00:11:22,805
Gentlemen,
what's the delay?

213
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:24,674
Sir, we've received
a new arrival

214
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:26,276
who refuses
to board.

215
00:11:26,309 --> 00:11:27,677
But that's impossible.

216
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,280
Have you explained
the rules to him?

217
00:11:30,313 --> 00:11:31,281
Yes, sir.

218
00:11:31,314 --> 00:11:32,282
Quite clearly?

219
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:33,283
Yes, sir.

220
00:11:33,316 --> 00:11:34,417
And what
was his rebuttal?

221
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:37,320
He took a coin
out of my ear.

222
00:11:37,354 --> 00:11:38,588
Did he?

223
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:41,591
Perhaps I should
have a word with him.

224
00:11:41,624 --> 00:11:43,460
Yes, sir.

225
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:44,961
Mr. Pendleton!

226
00:11:46,729 --> 00:11:49,366
He's right
over there, sir.

227
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:50,400
Mr. Pendleton!

228
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:52,869
Yeah. Hey,
you can call me Joe.

229
00:11:52,902 --> 00:11:54,271
How you doing?

230
00:11:54,304 --> 00:11:55,372
Mr. Pendleton,

231
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:57,907
you know where
you are, don't you?

232
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,743
I'm in the middle of
a really weird dream.

233
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:02,412
You see the problem?

234
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:03,980
Joe, come here.

235
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:16,926
Look at me

236
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,396
and listen carefully
to what I'm saying.

237
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:20,563
Yeah?

238
00:12:20,597 --> 00:12:22,699
This is not a dream.

239
00:12:22,732 --> 00:12:24,567
Yeah.

240
00:12:24,601 --> 00:12:27,304
Life has a certain
quality all its own,

241
00:12:27,337 --> 00:12:29,806
a certain feeling,
and so do dreams.

242
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,543
You know that this
is not life,

243
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:37,280
and you know now that
this is not a dream.

244
00:12:37,314 --> 00:12:39,682
This is a place
that comes after life

245
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:41,784
and after dreams.

246
00:12:41,818 --> 00:12:43,786
I'm sure
you're aware of that

247
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,889
and that you'll take
your place with the others.

248
00:12:51,361 --> 00:12:53,530
Are you trying
to tell me...

249
00:13:10,913 --> 00:13:12,882
I'm not supposed
to be here.

250
00:13:12,915 --> 00:13:14,617
But you are here.

251
00:13:14,651 --> 00:13:16,553
Well, you guys
made a mistake.

252
00:13:16,586 --> 00:13:17,954
This is insupportable.

253
00:13:17,987 --> 00:13:19,822
You're talking
to Mr. Jordan.

254
00:13:19,856 --> 00:13:21,591
Anybody can make a mistake.

255
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:23,826
Mr. Jordan, we're
due to take off.

256
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,429
Yes, I have
the situation in hand.

257
00:13:26,463 --> 00:13:28,965
Joe, if you don't
take your place,

258
00:13:28,998 --> 00:13:30,967
the others can't
complete their journey.

259
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,535
Do you think that's fair?

260
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:33,936
If this
is really heaven,

261
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,538
you're
supposed to be fair.

262
00:13:35,572 --> 00:13:37,607
I didn't
make any mistake.

263
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,009
This is not heaven.
It's a way station.

264
00:13:40,042 --> 00:13:41,611
There is no mistake.

265
00:13:41,644 --> 00:13:43,746
I want a check-out
on Joseph Pendleton.

266
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:47,550
When is he due to arrive
at this way station?

267
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:49,686
Sir,
I don't understand.

268
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:52,355
A check-out? Why?

269
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:54,624
The likelihood of one
individual being right

270
00:13:54,657 --> 00:13:55,892
increases
in direct proportion

271
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:57,894
to the intensity
with which others

272
00:13:57,927 --> 00:13:59,896
are trying
to prove him wrong.

273
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:01,030
Pendleton,
Joseph--

274
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:03,065
due to arrive
10:17 A.M.

275
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:06,436
March 20th of
the year 2025.

276
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,873
Sir, I really
can't believe it. I--

277
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:12,475
I took him out--i--

278
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:14,877
I took him out
just before the accident.

279
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:16,145
You did what?

280
00:14:16,178 --> 00:14:18,147
That car couldn't
have missed him.

281
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,451
You're supposed to wait
for the outcome.

282
00:14:21,484 --> 00:14:22,852
But I was so sure,

283
00:14:22,885 --> 00:14:25,555
and it looked like
it would be painful.

284
00:14:25,588 --> 00:14:26,823
Wait. Are you saying--

285
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:29,426
is this your first
assignment as an escort?

286
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:30,427
Yes, sir.

287
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,661
Haven't you learned

288
00:14:31,694 --> 00:14:33,663
the rules of probability
and outcome?

289
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:35,598
Every question
of life and death

290
00:14:35,632 --> 00:14:37,567
remains a probability
until the outcome.

291
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,968
So he jumped
the gun.

292
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:41,070
Put me back
where you found me,

293
00:14:41,103 --> 00:14:43,072
and we'll forget
the whole thing.

294
00:14:43,105 --> 00:14:46,876
This man must be put back
into his body at once.

295
00:14:46,909 --> 00:14:48,077
Yeah.

296
00:14:49,746 --> 00:14:51,714
Thanks, Mr. Jordan.

297
00:14:51,748 --> 00:14:54,751
Hey, I'll see you
in about 50 years.

298
00:15:06,162 --> 00:15:07,697
Hey, hey, Max.

299
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,098
Max, I'm back.
I'm back.

300
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:11,100
He can't hear you,
Mr. Pendleton.

301
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,702
I hope they got...

302
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:17,106
The best football team
in America in heaven,

303
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:19,709
and I hope god
makes you first-string.

304
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:20,843
Aw...

305
00:15:20,877 --> 00:15:23,613
Max, I'm going
to get my body back.

306
00:15:23,646 --> 00:15:25,948
Where's my body?
Where do they keep--

307
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:30,853
oh, dear.

308
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:32,589
Cremated. I see.

309
00:15:32,622 --> 00:15:34,991
I'm starting against
Dallas on Sunday.

310
00:15:35,024 --> 00:15:37,460
Joe, the body
you occupied on earth

311
00:15:37,494 --> 00:15:38,728
has been cremated.

312
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:40,129
Well, uncremate me,
that's all.

313
00:15:40,162 --> 00:15:42,732
You must be able
to do something right.

314
00:15:42,765 --> 00:15:44,734
Does "not being
a good sport"

315
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:46,736
mean anything
to you?

316
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:49,739
Joe, we can put you
into another man's body,

317
00:15:49,772 --> 00:15:52,208
provided his death
has not yet been discovered.

318
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:53,643
Are you kidding?

319
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:55,645
Put me into
another man's body?

320
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:57,980
I just got my body
back in shape.

321
00:15:58,014 --> 00:16:01,150
Joe, the only way
you can return to life

322
00:16:01,183 --> 00:16:03,720
is in the body
of another man.

323
00:16:05,187 --> 00:16:08,758
I shall have to take charge
of this case personally.

324
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,529
Incredibly graceful.

325
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:15,064
He's about your age
and in perfect condition.

326
00:16:15,097 --> 00:16:18,067
He's too short. He'd never
see over the line.

327
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,036
Aah!
Aah!

328
00:16:21,571 --> 00:16:24,541
You know what kind of
shape you gotta be in

329
00:16:24,574 --> 00:16:26,543
to get to
the super bowl?

330
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:29,011
Yes, Joe.
I understand.

331
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:34,116
He's not talking
english.

332
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,118
I told you
he was German.

333
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:38,721
Hey, you talk
any english?

334
00:16:38,755 --> 00:16:41,123
We can't be seen
or heard, Joe.

335
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:43,593
Well, I don't want
to talk German.

336
00:16:46,896 --> 00:16:49,899
I got to be able to call
plays in english.

337
00:16:49,932 --> 00:16:52,168
Joe, if you could
not so much lower

338
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:53,770
but broaden
your standards.

339
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:55,071
We've seen
many bodies,

340
00:16:55,104 --> 00:16:57,907
and the choices
are becoming limited.

341
00:17:06,248 --> 00:17:08,117
Julia, please,
I beg of you.

342
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,852
I want a drink.

343
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:10,853
There's plenty--

344
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:12,855
I've got to have
a drink.

345
00:17:12,889 --> 00:17:14,090
No, no, no.

346
00:17:14,123 --> 00:17:17,660
Mr. Farnsworth loathes
cold cucumber soup.

347
00:17:19,596 --> 00:17:22,098
Hey, this is some house.
Who lives here?

348
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:26,035
Leo Farnsworth,
a man of enormous power.

349
00:17:26,068 --> 00:17:28,638
We should make the arrangement
later this afternoon.

350
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:31,173
Thank you, sisk.

351
00:17:31,207 --> 00:17:34,176
Just leave the door open
as you leave, sisk.

352
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,778
Thank you very much.

353
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:38,180
The more servants
who see us, the better.

354
00:17:38,214 --> 00:17:39,916
This guy?
Are you kidding?

355
00:17:39,949 --> 00:17:41,784
That's not Farnsworth.

356
00:17:41,818 --> 00:17:43,653
Give me a drink.
Don't drink.

357
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:45,054
Who are they?

358
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:48,124
Farnsworth's wife and
his confidential secretary.

359
00:17:48,157 --> 00:17:49,592
You hate me.

360
00:17:49,626 --> 00:17:51,594
Don't be ridiculous.
I love you.

361
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:52,995
I want a drink!
Tony--

362
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,598
it would be better
if you didn't drink.

363
00:17:55,632 --> 00:17:58,601
How long will it be
before they find him?

364
00:17:58,635 --> 00:18:00,002
I don't know,
darling.

365
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:02,038
It shouldn't be long,
my dearest.

366
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:03,640
I'm glad we did it.

367
00:18:03,673 --> 00:18:04,907
We couldn't help it.

368
00:18:04,941 --> 00:18:06,308
Julia,
it would be better

369
00:18:06,342 --> 00:18:08,745
if you'd try
not to unravel now.

370
00:18:08,778 --> 00:18:09,979
Thank you, Julia.

371
00:18:10,012 --> 00:18:12,114
Is Farnsworth
dead yet?

372
00:18:12,148 --> 00:18:13,182
Not yet.

373
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:14,784
What's the matter
with him?

374
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:16,786
He can't
keep his eyes open.

375
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:19,188
He's been drugged
by those two downstairs.

376
00:18:19,221 --> 00:18:20,923
This is a murder.

377
00:18:20,957 --> 00:18:24,894
You see how he's slowly
sliding into the water?

378
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:26,262
Hey, somebody, get--

379
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:32,769
hey, hey, get a doctor.
There's a guy--

380
00:18:32,802 --> 00:18:34,036
hey, get a doctor.

381
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,639
You got a guy
drowning in the bathtub.

382
00:18:36,673 --> 00:18:39,041
You left a bare pot
on the carpet.

383
00:18:39,075 --> 00:18:41,043
I can't hold everything
at once.

384
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:42,645
Mrs. Farnsworth

385
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:44,046
would kill you
if she saw that.

386
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,816
Hey, somebody!
You got, uh--

387
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:48,851
give me a drink.
I'd like a drink!

388
00:18:48,885 --> 00:18:50,720
Try not to go
overboard, dear.

389
00:18:50,753 --> 00:18:53,389
He was a lecherous,
sadistic son of a bitch.

390
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:55,992
Everyone wanted him dead.
I should be canonized!

391
00:18:56,025 --> 00:18:57,894
Perhaps one drink.

392
00:18:57,927 --> 00:18:59,295
Where can
the man be?

393
00:18:59,328 --> 00:19:00,763
I'm sorry,
miss Logan.

394
00:19:00,797 --> 00:19:02,899
What harm
can that do him?

395
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:04,033
We did it,

396
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:06,302
but that man
deserves to be dead.

397
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:07,436
Please.

398
00:19:07,469 --> 00:19:09,205
They're murderers.

399
00:19:09,238 --> 00:19:10,807
What's going on
out there?

400
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,942
I'm sorry, sir.
It's that miss Logan

401
00:19:12,975 --> 00:19:14,343
here to see
Mr. Farnsworth.

402
00:19:14,376 --> 00:19:15,411
Show her in.

403
00:19:15,444 --> 00:19:17,013
Yes, sir.

404
00:19:17,046 --> 00:19:18,280
Oh, my god.

405
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:20,750
No. It's
the perfect alibi.

406
00:19:20,783 --> 00:19:22,151
She insists
on seeing him.

407
00:19:22,184 --> 00:19:23,753
Let's look for
another body.

408
00:19:23,786 --> 00:19:25,688
A servant
will find the body.

409
00:19:25,722 --> 00:19:27,957
Keep sisk with you
at all times

410
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,225
to establish
your whereabouts.

411
00:19:29,258 --> 00:19:30,827
Let's get
out of here.

412
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,394
Miss Logan, sir.

413
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,398
Oh, miss Logan.
I'm Tony abbott.

414
00:19:36,432 --> 00:19:39,869
This is the library.

415
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:41,738
That's
Mrs. Farnsworth.

416
00:19:41,771 --> 00:19:43,005
Hello.

417
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,141
I'm going
into the living room.

418
00:19:45,174 --> 00:19:47,009
Want to come, sisk?

419
00:19:47,043 --> 00:19:48,978
Oh, yes.
Certainly, madam.

420
00:19:50,312 --> 00:19:51,881
I'm Mr. Farnsworth's

421
00:19:51,914 --> 00:19:53,883
personal and private
executive secretary.

422
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,152
I didn't know
whether you knew that.

423
00:19:56,185 --> 00:19:58,420
I'm sorry
he's not down yet.

424
00:19:58,454 --> 00:20:00,890
That's all right.
I'll wait.

425
00:20:00,923 --> 00:20:02,759
Would you
take a seat?

426
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:04,761
No, thank you.

427
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:08,230
Perhaps you'd like to
tell me what it's about.

428
00:20:10,132 --> 00:20:12,501
Mr. Farnsworth has been sent
hundreds of letters

429
00:20:12,534 --> 00:20:15,071
from a town in England
called Pagglesham.

430
00:20:15,104 --> 00:20:18,040
The people who live there--
1,600, including my father--

431
00:20:18,074 --> 00:20:21,043
are about to be forcibly
evicted from their homes

432
00:20:21,077 --> 00:20:24,280
to make way for the proposed
exo-grey refinery.

433
00:20:24,313 --> 00:20:26,248
Not only will hundreds
of families

434
00:20:26,282 --> 00:20:28,250
be forced to find
other homes,

435
00:20:28,284 --> 00:20:31,854
but the few who remain will
have their health endangered

436
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:34,857
by the inevitable poisoning
of their air and water,

437
00:20:34,891 --> 00:20:37,860
the documented evidence
for which I have here,

438
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:39,261
along with a petition

439
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,899
signed by the 1,673 citizens
of that area.

440
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:45,935
This is what I'm here

441
00:20:45,968 --> 00:20:47,469
to see Mr. Farnsworth
about.

442
00:20:47,503 --> 00:20:49,338
You're aware
Mr. Farnsworth

443
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:50,840
conducts business
at his office?

444
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:53,943
I've been to his office.
He refused to see me.

445
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:56,412
I seriously doubt
he'd see you here.

446
00:20:56,445 --> 00:20:59,148
He'll have to,
because I'm not leaving.

447
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,819
I'm sorry?

448
00:21:02,852 --> 00:21:04,286
I'm not leaving.

449
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,555
I've come 8,000 miles,
Mr. Abbott,

450
00:21:06,588 --> 00:21:09,091
to do something about
a terrible injustice

451
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:11,360
that this man Leo Farnsworth
has perpetrated

452
00:21:11,393 --> 00:21:14,296
on hundreds of innocent,
defenseless people.

453
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,564
Somebody ought
to help her.

454
00:21:15,597 --> 00:21:17,499
You can help her, Joe.

455
00:21:17,533 --> 00:21:19,168
You can be Farnsworth.

456
00:21:19,201 --> 00:21:21,170
If Mr. Farnsworth
doesn't see me,

457
00:21:21,203 --> 00:21:23,139
I don't know
what I'll do.

458
00:21:23,172 --> 00:21:25,107
Is that a threat?

459
00:21:25,141 --> 00:21:26,575
Yes.

460
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:29,011
I don't want
to be Farnsworth.

461
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:30,279
The decision is yours.

462
00:21:30,312 --> 00:21:32,548
Miss Logan, you
give me no choice.

463
00:21:32,581 --> 00:21:34,283
Sisk!

464
00:21:34,316 --> 00:21:36,152
If I had to be
Farnsworth,

465
00:21:36,185 --> 00:21:37,553
could we
do it temporary?

466
00:21:37,586 --> 00:21:39,088
Yes.

467
00:21:39,121 --> 00:21:42,458
We could arrange that
if you wish it.

468
00:21:42,491 --> 00:21:44,026
Sisk!

469
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,995
Sisk, please
tell Mr. Farnsworth

470
00:21:46,028 --> 00:21:47,396
miss Logan is here

471
00:21:47,429 --> 00:21:48,865
and refuses
to leave.

472
00:21:48,898 --> 00:21:49,932
Yes, sir.

473
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:52,068
If you really
want to help her,

474
00:21:52,101 --> 00:21:54,070
you'd better hurry.

475
00:21:54,103 --> 00:21:56,072
Well, it's only
temporary, right?

476
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:57,573
That's correct.

477
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:02,344
Only Farnsworth
can help her.

478
00:22:02,378 --> 00:22:05,147
Once the body's discovered,
it'll be too late.

479
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,625
Hey.

480
00:22:16,658 --> 00:22:17,994
That's me.

481
00:22:19,428 --> 00:22:21,097
I haven't changed.

482
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,868
It's just me.

483
00:22:25,902 --> 00:22:26,869
Mr. Farnsworth?

484
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:28,537
Now what do we do?

485
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,639
Mr. Farnsworth,
are you there, sir?

486
00:22:30,672 --> 00:22:32,641
I'll never get away
with this.

487
00:22:32,674 --> 00:22:34,243
What will we do now?

488
00:22:34,276 --> 00:22:36,078
Are you all right?

489
00:22:36,112 --> 00:22:37,246
Answer him.

490
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,981
People can hear me now?

491
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:40,116
Of course.

492
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:42,518
But he knows
the other guy's voice.

493
00:22:42,551 --> 00:22:44,954
Mr. Farnsworth, is everything
all right in there?

494
00:22:44,987 --> 00:22:46,288
Answer him.

495
00:22:47,556 --> 00:22:50,126
Ahem. Um, will you
take it easy?

496
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,394
I'll be out
in a minute.

497
00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:53,930
Very good, sir.

498
00:22:55,197 --> 00:22:56,398
It works.

499
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:59,001
Of course. Inwardly,
you haven't changed.

500
00:22:59,035 --> 00:23:00,402
You're still
Joe Pendleton.

501
00:23:00,436 --> 00:23:02,404
That's what
you and I see.

502
00:23:02,438 --> 00:23:04,006
But outwardly,
you're Leo Farnsworth,

503
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:07,043
and that's what
everyone else will see.

504
00:23:15,284 --> 00:23:18,487
Miss Betty Logan
is downstairs, sir.

505
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,957
She insists
upon seeing you.

506
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,959
Do you wish
to dress, sir?

507
00:23:22,992 --> 00:23:24,360
Oh, uh, sure, sure.

508
00:23:24,393 --> 00:23:25,962
Very good, sir.

509
00:23:25,995 --> 00:23:28,364
You mean I'm going to
sound like this guy,

510
00:23:28,397 --> 00:23:30,366
no matter
what I talk like?

511
00:23:30,399 --> 00:23:32,368
I beg your pardon,
Mr. Farnsworth?

512
00:23:32,401 --> 00:23:34,270
You see?

513
00:23:34,303 --> 00:23:36,105
Ha ha ha ha.

514
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:38,540
Heh heh heh heh.

515
00:23:40,576 --> 00:23:41,978
Well...

516
00:23:46,315 --> 00:23:47,583
Ahh.

517
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:48,917
Whoa.

518
00:23:53,689 --> 00:23:56,258
Julia, Julia, Julia,
please, please, dear.

519
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:58,260
Please, dear,
not now. Not now.

520
00:23:58,294 --> 00:23:59,661
I want a sip.

521
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:02,164
You're sorry you
helped, aren't you?

522
00:24:02,198 --> 00:24:05,134
You wish
he were alive.

523
00:24:05,167 --> 00:24:07,569
Why don't you say
it's not true?

524
00:24:07,603 --> 00:24:09,671
You didn't say
it's not true.

525
00:24:09,705 --> 00:24:11,273
It's not true.

526
00:24:11,307 --> 00:24:12,674
Say it again.

527
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,276
Darling, darling,
it's not true.

528
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:16,278
I don't hate you.
I love you.

529
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,015
There, sir.

530
00:24:19,048 --> 00:24:20,549
Thank you. Thank you.

531
00:24:20,582 --> 00:24:21,683
Ahem.

532
00:24:26,088 --> 00:24:27,456
Your helmet, sir.

533
00:24:27,489 --> 00:24:28,457
Huh?

534
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,059
Your Polo helmet, sir.

535
00:24:30,092 --> 00:24:33,062
Oh, thanks. Thanks.
Uh, do I play Polo?

536
00:24:33,095 --> 00:24:34,596
Oh, not really, sir.

537
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,697
Sir?

538
00:24:37,766 --> 00:24:39,335
Thank you. Thank you.

539
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:41,070
This Logan girl
is a godsend.

540
00:24:41,103 --> 00:24:42,671
What's taking so long?

541
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:45,741
Pick up the fountainhead.
Pretend you're reading.

542
00:24:45,774 --> 00:24:47,343
Right. All right.

543
00:24:47,376 --> 00:24:48,744
You go up.

544
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:50,112
All right.

545
00:24:57,553 --> 00:24:59,221
Miss Logan, sir.

546
00:24:59,255 --> 00:25:02,024
Hi. How you doing?

547
00:25:02,058 --> 00:25:06,162
I'm not leaving until you've
heard what I have to say.

548
00:25:06,195 --> 00:25:09,231
Uh, oh, yeah.
Well, good.

549
00:25:09,265 --> 00:25:11,633
You've been sent
hundreds of letters

550
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:14,236
from a town in England
called Pagglesham.

551
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,637
I know about
that situation.

552
00:25:15,671 --> 00:25:17,373
Have you read
the letters?

553
00:25:17,406 --> 00:25:18,540
Well...

554
00:25:18,574 --> 00:25:20,142
Uh...

555
00:25:20,176 --> 00:25:21,277
Well, no.

556
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,679
No, you haven't.
I suspected as much.

557
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,681
That's why
I've flown over here.

558
00:25:25,714 --> 00:25:28,284
I and the 1,673 people
whom I represent

559
00:25:28,317 --> 00:25:30,686
and whose names
are on this petition

560
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:33,122
are not going to
allow their futures

561
00:25:33,155 --> 00:25:35,124
to be determined
by mindless bureaucrats

562
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:36,525
at the Beck and call

563
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:39,661
of certain so-called
industrialists

564
00:25:39,695 --> 00:25:42,264
for whom elderly men
and women and children

565
00:25:42,298 --> 00:25:43,799
are just figures
to be entered

566
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:46,268
in your ledgers'
profit and loss column.

567
00:25:46,302 --> 00:25:47,503
Do I make myself clear?

568
00:25:47,536 --> 00:25:48,804
Yeah, but--

569
00:25:48,837 --> 00:25:52,741
there are no buts.
You can have me dragged out.

570
00:25:52,774 --> 00:25:55,744
It would be bad publicity
for exo-grey industries.

571
00:25:55,777 --> 00:25:57,746
Why don't you just
sit down?

572
00:25:57,779 --> 00:25:59,348
I prefer to stand.

573
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:01,417
We can stand up.

574
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,818
I've made it my business

575
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:05,554
to find out about
exo-grey industries.

576
00:26:05,587 --> 00:26:08,590
Facts that would make
interesting newspaper copy.

577
00:26:08,624 --> 00:26:09,758
Ah. Well...

578
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:11,860
Your tea,
Mr. Farnsworth.

579
00:26:11,893 --> 00:26:14,263
Oh, right. Uh, yeah.

580
00:26:14,296 --> 00:26:16,265
My--my--my tea.

581
00:26:16,298 --> 00:26:17,399
Uh...

582
00:26:17,433 --> 00:26:19,801
Anything else,
Mr. Farnsworth?

583
00:26:19,835 --> 00:26:22,404
Uh, no. I think
that's about it.

584
00:26:22,438 --> 00:26:24,106
Uh, thanks a lot.

585
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,508
Thank you. Uh,
you want some tea?

586
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:30,479
I want to know what you're
going to do about Pagglesham.

587
00:26:30,512 --> 00:26:31,613
Pagglesham! Pagglesham!

588
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:33,849
It's what
we're talking about!

589
00:26:33,882 --> 00:26:35,451
These people
care very much

590
00:26:35,484 --> 00:26:37,853
that their community
doesn't become destroyed

591
00:26:37,886 --> 00:26:40,489
in the name
of free enterprise.

592
00:26:40,522 --> 00:26:42,891
They care because
they are a community

593
00:26:42,924 --> 00:26:45,361
where hundreds of families
have lived for generations.

594
00:26:45,394 --> 00:26:46,528
I know.

595
00:26:46,562 --> 00:26:49,265
These people are not
going to allow you

596
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:51,333
to intimidate
and frighten them.

597
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:52,668
I don't
frighten anybody.

598
00:26:52,701 --> 00:26:54,803
Aah! Aah! Aah!

599
00:26:54,836 --> 00:26:58,840
Aah! Aah! Aah!
Mmmf!

600
00:26:58,874 --> 00:27:00,176
Mmmf!

601
00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:02,578
Oh, my god!

602
00:27:04,913 --> 00:27:07,516
What in god's name
is that?

603
00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:09,651
Well, that--
that was m--

604
00:27:09,685 --> 00:27:13,389
uh, my--
my Mrs. Farnsworth.

605
00:27:14,823 --> 00:27:16,792
Sorry to disturb you,
Mr. Farnsworth.

606
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:18,794
Mrs. Farnsworth
saw a mouse,

607
00:27:18,827 --> 00:27:20,262
but she's better now.

608
00:27:20,296 --> 00:27:21,897
She just saw a mouse?

609
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,900
No. Before. Outside.
But she relives it.

610
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:28,504
I'll be in the other room
if you need me, sir.

611
00:27:28,537 --> 00:27:29,905
Excuse me.

612
00:27:29,938 --> 00:27:31,907
What's the matter
with her?

613
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:35,544
Well, listen, uh...
I don't know.

614
00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:36,645
It's really none
of my business.

615
00:27:36,678 --> 00:27:38,514
Your wife's none
of your business?

616
00:27:38,547 --> 00:27:39,915
Wait. You don't
understand.

617
00:27:39,948 --> 00:27:41,750
I understand one thing.

618
00:27:41,783 --> 00:27:44,420
We will never allow you
to build that refinery.

619
00:27:44,453 --> 00:27:45,687
All right.

620
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:48,224
I'll build my refinery
in some other place.

621
00:27:48,257 --> 00:27:49,691
Very funny.

622
00:27:49,725 --> 00:27:52,694
If you think I'm going back
to Pagglesham, you're wrong.

623
00:27:52,728 --> 00:27:55,297
I know you're not
afraid of me.

624
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:58,300
You think a schoolteacher
from a small town

625
00:27:58,334 --> 00:28:00,602
is no challenge for
a world-famous industrialist.

626
00:28:00,636 --> 00:28:02,204
Will you please listen?

627
00:28:02,238 --> 00:28:03,605
Just be quiet a minute.

628
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:06,208
Just let me say
one thing.

629
00:28:06,242 --> 00:28:07,609
What is it?

630
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:08,710
Sit down.

631
00:28:11,747 --> 00:28:12,914
Why?

632
00:28:12,948 --> 00:28:14,516
If you'd just sit down,

633
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,918
I think I can explain
something to you

634
00:28:16,952 --> 00:28:19,621
that'll clear
this whole thing up.

635
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:30,399
I'm not really
Leo Farnsworth.

636
00:28:30,432 --> 00:28:31,500
What?

637
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:33,001
My name is Joe.

638
00:28:33,034 --> 00:28:34,670
Very funny,
Mr. Farnsworth.

639
00:28:34,703 --> 00:28:38,274
I'm sure you enjoy playing
these insulting little games.

640
00:28:38,307 --> 00:28:41,843
However, I happen
to know about

641
00:28:41,877 --> 00:28:43,545
your board meeting
on Thursday,

642
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:45,947
which may mean
nothing to you,

643
00:28:45,981 --> 00:28:49,385
but if you think
you can treat women

644
00:28:49,418 --> 00:28:52,288
with the same contempt
your company treats the world,

645
00:28:52,321 --> 00:28:54,290
you've got a lot
to learn about

646
00:28:54,323 --> 00:28:56,292
the strength and persistence
of people like myself.

647
00:28:56,325 --> 00:28:59,795
Don't think you're going
to get away with this.

648
00:29:04,633 --> 00:29:07,603
You got till that board
meeting on Thursday

649
00:29:07,636 --> 00:29:11,307
to find me a body that
can play quarterback.

650
00:29:14,343 --> 00:29:17,313
Darling,
I'm going to let you go.

651
00:29:17,346 --> 00:29:20,316
I'm going
to let you go now.

652
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:23,319
Listen. There is nothing
to be frightened of.

653
00:29:23,352 --> 00:29:25,621
There's plenty
to be worried about,

654
00:29:25,654 --> 00:29:28,324
but there is nothing
to be frightened of.

655
00:29:28,357 --> 00:29:30,326
Are you all right?
Can I trust you?

656
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,328
Yes, dearest?
Hmm.

657
00:29:32,361 --> 00:29:33,429
Hmm.

658
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,499
You locked me
in a closet.

659
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:38,534
Only for a moment.

660
00:29:38,567 --> 00:29:39,668
What did you tell him?

661
00:29:39,701 --> 00:29:41,937
You saw a mouse.

662
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,941
I'm not good at spur-
of-the-moment alibis.

663
00:29:45,974 --> 00:29:47,676
He's probably
got enough evidence

664
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:49,678
to lock us away forever.

665
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:50,812
I don't understand this.

666
00:29:50,846 --> 00:29:53,815
I saw him inhale
the nose spray.

667
00:29:53,849 --> 00:29:55,817
He never
really inhaled it.

668
00:29:55,851 --> 00:29:57,419
He overheard us somehow.

669
00:29:57,453 --> 00:30:00,422
Maybe he's got us
bugged right now.

670
00:30:00,456 --> 00:30:03,425
An electronics expert
sweeps the place daily.

671
00:30:03,459 --> 00:30:05,827
He's afraid
of being bugged, too.

672
00:30:05,861 --> 00:30:07,429
He's playing with us.

673
00:30:07,463 --> 00:30:09,831
He's playing
a game with us,

674
00:30:09,865 --> 00:30:11,433
that's what it is.

675
00:30:11,467 --> 00:30:13,101
You locked me
in a closet. Why?

676
00:30:13,134 --> 00:30:14,903
Aah!
Aah!

677
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:16,104
Hello.

678
00:30:16,137 --> 00:30:19,107
Mr. Farnsworth would
like to see you now.

679
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,709
Yes, indeed. Yes.

680
00:30:20,742 --> 00:30:22,711
Would you excuse me,
Mrs. Farnsworth?

681
00:30:22,744 --> 00:30:24,813
Yes, of course,
Mr. Abbott.

682
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:30,719
We could take it up
at the board meeting,

683
00:30:30,752 --> 00:30:32,721
but I'm sure it's legal.

684
00:30:32,754 --> 00:30:35,457
Can't you do something
legal and be wrong?

685
00:30:35,491 --> 00:30:36,458
In what sense?

686
00:30:36,492 --> 00:30:37,726
Bad for
somebody else.

687
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:39,395
What are
you referring to?

688
00:30:39,428 --> 00:30:42,731
Like this refinery
in Pagglesham.

689
00:30:43,765 --> 00:30:45,133
Was that
the living room?

690
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,735
No. That
was my office.

691
00:30:46,768 --> 00:30:48,737
My coordination
is shot, huh?

692
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,738
Yes, sir.

693
00:30:49,771 --> 00:30:51,507
Just not my day.

694
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,408
No, sir.

695
00:30:54,776 --> 00:30:57,746
I wanted to discuss
the Haitian arrangement,

696
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,748
the 2 1/2 million acres.

697
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:01,149
What 2 1/2 million
acres?

698
00:31:01,182 --> 00:31:02,751
The sugar deal.

699
00:31:02,784 --> 00:31:03,685
It's no good.

700
00:31:03,719 --> 00:31:04,753
The deal?

701
00:31:04,786 --> 00:31:06,755
No. Sugar.
It's bad for the body.

702
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:09,157
Want me to speak
to the Haitian ambassador?

703
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,759
Check on that
Pagglesham thing.

704
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:12,160
See if we're
hurting anybody.

705
00:31:12,193 --> 00:31:13,762
If we're
hurting anybody?

706
00:31:13,795 --> 00:31:14,863
Yeah.

707
00:31:26,074 --> 00:31:28,677
Is the wicket bugged?

708
00:31:31,813 --> 00:31:34,783
We certainly wouldn't
want to hurt anybody.

709
00:31:34,816 --> 00:31:36,184
That's the last thing

710
00:31:36,217 --> 00:31:39,187
exo-grey would ever want
to do, isn't that right?

711
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,790
Yeah. We don't want
to hurt anybody.

712
00:31:41,823 --> 00:31:42,958
Thank you.

713
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,595
Ah. "Pagglesham."

714
00:32:03,545 --> 00:32:06,882
He pretended not to know
what a stockholder was.

715
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:09,485
I can't tell whether
he's toying with me

716
00:32:09,518 --> 00:32:11,753
or if he'd precipitate
a crisis in the company.

717
00:32:11,787 --> 00:32:13,154
Of course he's toying.

718
00:32:13,188 --> 00:32:15,156
Think he'll forget
being drugged?

719
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,157
Why would he pretend?

720
00:32:16,191 --> 00:32:17,726
For the same reason

721
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:20,161
he pretended to inhale
the nose spray--to bait us.

722
00:32:20,195 --> 00:32:21,763
He's waiting
for us to crack.

723
00:32:21,797 --> 00:32:24,165
Do you actually think
he's playing that saxophone?

724
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:25,767
There's a tape inside.

725
00:32:25,801 --> 00:32:27,903
That's why we hear
the same song over and over.

726
00:32:27,936 --> 00:32:30,672
It's like those
idiot costumes of his.

727
00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:34,209
You are dumb, aren't you?

728
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,001
Thanks.

729
00:33:33,034 --> 00:33:34,803
Thank you.

730
00:33:40,308 --> 00:33:42,544
Their magic number
is now just one,

731
00:33:42,578 --> 00:33:44,045
meaning
a ram victory Sunday

732
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:46,181
or next week
against the falcons

733
00:33:46,214 --> 00:33:47,783
or a 49er loss,

734
00:33:47,816 --> 00:33:51,787
and the rams clinch
the NFL western division title.

735
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,622
The way
they've been playing,

736
00:33:53,655 --> 00:33:55,791
the team feels
this is the rams' year

737
00:33:55,824 --> 00:33:57,158
to go
to the super bowl.

738
00:33:57,192 --> 00:33:59,761
Jarrett has completed
an astounding 62%

739
00:33:59,795 --> 00:34:04,766
of his passes
for 18 touchdowns.

740
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,068
The defense has given up
but 10 points a game,

741
00:34:07,102 --> 00:34:10,071
while the offense is
scoring 21 points a game.

742
00:34:10,105 --> 00:34:12,040
The rams' record
is the best...

743
00:34:36,832 --> 00:34:39,167
What you're saying
is that, um...

744
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,036
Nobody should have
that information,

745
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:43,805
because if 2 big
companies get together,

746
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,774
they're worth
more money, huh?

747
00:34:45,807 --> 00:34:46,842
Yes, sir.

748
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:49,845
That's why the rumor
of a merger

749
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:52,848
makes the price
of the stock rise.

750
00:34:52,881 --> 00:34:55,851
If it's supposed
to be a secret,

751
00:34:55,884 --> 00:34:57,352
how does
the rumor start?

752
00:34:57,385 --> 00:34:59,955
Well, sir,
wrong as it seems,

753
00:34:59,988 --> 00:35:01,089
they leak it.

754
00:35:01,122 --> 00:35:03,124
But that's
dishonest, isn't it?

755
00:35:03,158 --> 00:35:05,627
Yes, it is.

756
00:35:14,803 --> 00:35:16,137
Well...

757
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:18,840
If I got a board
meeting tomorrow,

758
00:35:18,874 --> 00:35:21,710
I got to do a lot
of studying tonight.

759
00:35:21,743 --> 00:35:23,344
Yes, sir.

760
00:35:23,378 --> 00:35:26,214
How you doing
down there?

761
00:35:26,247 --> 00:35:29,150
Oh, I'm doing fine.
Thank you very much.

762
00:35:29,184 --> 00:35:30,151
Yeah?

763
00:35:30,185 --> 00:35:31,853
Thanks.

764
00:35:31,887 --> 00:35:33,789
Thanks a lot.

765
00:35:35,691 --> 00:35:38,393
Say, uh,
thanks for dinner.

766
00:35:44,232 --> 00:35:47,135
I think we should
do it right away.

767
00:35:47,168 --> 00:35:50,238
Sisk, may we have some
more coffee, please?

768
00:36:15,997 --> 00:36:18,366
And now
for your hat, sir.

769
00:36:18,399 --> 00:36:21,970
Do you wish the homburg
or the bowler, sir,

770
00:36:22,003 --> 00:36:24,806
or something that makes
more of a statement?

771
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,107
Whatever you say.

772
00:36:26,141 --> 00:36:30,111
Why have I got so many
of these sailor outfits?

773
00:36:30,145 --> 00:36:33,114
Oh, sir, you have
always fancied the sea.

774
00:36:33,148 --> 00:36:34,850
Uh-huh. Do I sail?

775
00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:38,854
Not really, sir.

776
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:40,722
Uh-huh.

777
00:36:40,756 --> 00:36:41,957
Ok, ok.

778
00:37:33,241 --> 00:37:36,077
Mr. Farnsworth, I'm
Helen rich from the times.

779
00:37:36,111 --> 00:37:38,446
I've this petition from
the citizens of Pagglesham.

780
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:40,248
Do you plan to do
anything about it?

781
00:37:40,281 --> 00:37:42,150
We're taking that
under consideration.

782
00:37:42,183 --> 00:37:44,853
We really
have to be going.

783
00:37:44,886 --> 00:37:46,487
Mr. Farnsworth,
is it true

784
00:37:46,521 --> 00:37:49,324
that 3 newly proposed
exo-grey factories

785
00:37:49,357 --> 00:37:50,926
will displace
11 communities?

786
00:37:50,959 --> 00:37:52,928
11?
Is it that many?

787
00:37:52,961 --> 00:37:54,930
They granted the permits
to build them.

788
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:57,332
I guess so,
if we got 'em.

789
00:37:57,365 --> 00:37:59,935
How did exo-grey
get those permits?

790
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:02,237
Beats me. I guess
we bribed somebody.

791
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,338
He's joking.

792
00:38:03,371 --> 00:38:05,340
Really,
we must be going.

793
00:38:05,373 --> 00:38:06,341
Mr. Farnsworth,

794
00:38:06,374 --> 00:38:07,943
what about
acrilonitrile?

795
00:38:07,976 --> 00:38:09,210
What about what?

796
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:10,345
Acrilonitrile--

797
00:38:10,378 --> 00:38:11,947
the toxic substance
released

798
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,950
by the plastic bottles
your company markets

799
00:38:14,983 --> 00:38:16,952
despite the consumer
protection league's lawsuit

800
00:38:16,985 --> 00:38:18,353
forcing you
to delay distribution

801
00:38:18,386 --> 00:38:20,956
until the effects
have been tested.

802
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:22,958
I've been studying
this thing.

803
00:38:22,991 --> 00:38:24,960
Why don't you
come inside

804
00:38:24,993 --> 00:38:26,962
and see what's
going on yourselves?

805
00:38:26,995 --> 00:38:28,363
You can't have
outsiders--

806
00:38:28,396 --> 00:38:29,364
sure, we can.

807
00:38:29,397 --> 00:38:31,066
Come on in,
everybody.

808
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,808
Hi.

809
00:38:54,589 --> 00:38:57,425
Hi. How you doing,
everybody? I, uh...

810
00:38:57,458 --> 00:39:00,461
These people are reporters
from some of the newspapers.

811
00:39:00,495 --> 00:39:02,630
I thought it would be good

812
00:39:02,663 --> 00:39:05,033
if they saw
how we did things.

813
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:07,302
Leo, this is a very
dangerous precedent.

814
00:39:07,335 --> 00:39:10,972
We have a very full
agenda today already.

815
00:39:11,006 --> 00:39:14,409
I don't see that we
have time for a press--

816
00:39:14,442 --> 00:39:18,013
couldn't an accident in your
west coast nuclear plant

817
00:39:18,046 --> 00:39:20,882
stimulate seismic activity
in the San Andreas fault,

818
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:23,952
which could destroy most
of Southern California?

819
00:39:23,985 --> 00:39:27,288
I think you'd have
to define "destroy."

820
00:39:27,322 --> 00:39:29,424
Excuse me,
ladies and gentlemen.

821
00:39:29,457 --> 00:39:31,993
I'd like to make
something perfectly clear.

822
00:39:32,027 --> 00:39:34,229
The exo-grey
nuclear facility

823
00:39:34,262 --> 00:39:37,232
has a foolproof
built-in safety system

824
00:39:37,265 --> 00:39:40,235
that guarantees
no danger of any kind.

825
00:39:40,268 --> 00:39:41,636
That's rubbish.

826
00:39:41,669 --> 00:39:43,238
If there's no danger,

827
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:45,373
why are
we in a lawsuit?

828
00:39:45,406 --> 00:39:48,209
It's a protest,
not a lawsuit.

829
00:39:48,243 --> 00:39:49,610
That's not the point.

830
00:39:49,644 --> 00:39:51,212
We're doing
something wrong.

831
00:39:51,246 --> 00:39:52,613
Everybody's suing us.

832
00:39:52,647 --> 00:39:54,950
We got a lawsuit
from a refinery,

833
00:39:54,983 --> 00:39:56,551
a nuclear lawsuit.

834
00:39:56,584 --> 00:39:59,154
A guy named porpoise
is suing us.

835
00:39:59,187 --> 00:40:00,355
Uh, Mr. Farnsworth,

836
00:40:00,388 --> 00:40:02,423
that's an ecological suit

837
00:40:02,457 --> 00:40:04,425
brought against
our canning factory

838
00:40:04,459 --> 00:40:06,527
for destroying
porpoises.

839
00:40:06,561 --> 00:40:08,563
Ahem. Uh...

840
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:12,968
For god's sake,
he knows that.

841
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:14,435
We can porpoises?

842
00:40:14,469 --> 00:40:16,437
Our San Diego
fleet is...

843
00:40:16,471 --> 00:40:17,672
As everybody
here knows,

844
00:40:17,705 --> 00:40:19,340
we can tuna.

845
00:40:19,374 --> 00:40:20,575
In netting the tuna,

846
00:40:20,608 --> 00:40:23,278
we kill a number
of porpoises.

847
00:40:23,311 --> 00:40:26,681
Since they're mammals of
alleged high intelligence,

848
00:40:26,714 --> 00:40:28,549
there's been
an outcry.

849
00:40:28,583 --> 00:40:29,550
Yeah...well...

850
00:40:29,584 --> 00:40:30,551
Uh...

851
00:40:30,585 --> 00:40:32,053
Yeah.

852
00:40:32,087 --> 00:40:33,421
Uh...

853
00:40:33,454 --> 00:40:34,622
Yeah.

854
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:37,658
I would just like
to ask you a question.

855
00:40:37,692 --> 00:40:40,661
Why is he bringing
the press in here?

856
00:40:40,695 --> 00:40:42,263
You know Leo Farnsworth.

857
00:40:42,297 --> 00:40:44,699
Maybe I don't know
Leo Farnsworth.

858
00:40:44,732 --> 00:40:46,034
Exactly.

859
00:40:46,067 --> 00:40:47,635
We have a corporate
responsibility

860
00:40:47,668 --> 00:40:49,637
extending to thousands
of shareholders

861
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,239
of moderate means,

862
00:40:51,272 --> 00:40:53,441
people who are
less well off

863
00:40:53,474 --> 00:40:55,010
than the ecological
groups fighting us.

864
00:40:55,043 --> 00:40:57,112
If we were
a football team,

865
00:40:57,145 --> 00:41:00,515
would you say we had
a winning season so far?

866
00:41:04,152 --> 00:41:06,154
Leo, I haven't the faintest
idea what you're--

867
00:41:06,187 --> 00:41:07,322
just generally.

868
00:41:07,355 --> 00:41:09,557
Would you say
we got a winning season?

869
00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:12,727
I would say on balance

870
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,696
we have had
an extremely good year.

871
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:17,465
We've got a winning season.

872
00:41:17,498 --> 00:41:19,234
What do you do when
you're ahead in the game?

873
00:41:19,267 --> 00:41:20,501
I don't know
what you want.

874
00:41:20,535 --> 00:41:23,504
I'll tell you,
you don't make mistakes.

875
00:41:23,538 --> 00:41:25,006
You don't gamble
unnecessarily.

876
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,408
You got
to protect your lead.

877
00:41:27,442 --> 00:41:29,544
You don't pass
from your own end zone.

878
00:41:29,577 --> 00:41:31,779
You make sure
nobody gets hurt.

879
00:41:31,812 --> 00:41:34,715
You got to use these
guys in the next game.

880
00:41:34,749 --> 00:41:36,417
We won this game.

881
00:41:36,451 --> 00:41:38,253
We got to stay in shape
for the rest of the game.

882
00:41:38,286 --> 00:41:40,288
That's the responsible
thing to do.

883
00:41:40,321 --> 00:41:42,690
It's like when
everybody was supposed

884
00:41:42,723 --> 00:41:43,691
to stop eating grapes.

885
00:41:43,724 --> 00:41:45,060
I didn't

886
00:41:45,093 --> 00:41:46,494
'cause I didn't know
about it.

887
00:41:46,527 --> 00:41:49,064
A lot of guys
will keep eating tuna.

888
00:41:49,097 --> 00:41:51,466
But I was thinking,
what if we had

889
00:41:51,499 --> 00:41:54,469
a good-guy tuna company
on the porpoise team?

890
00:41:54,502 --> 00:41:56,071
Guys would buy that

891
00:41:56,104 --> 00:41:58,106
so kids wouldn't
get mad at them.

892
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:00,575
I don't think they're
taking in account...

893
00:42:00,608 --> 00:42:01,642
The expense.

894
00:42:01,676 --> 00:42:04,079
We don't care
how much it costs,

895
00:42:04,112 --> 00:42:06,081
just how much it makes.

896
00:42:06,114 --> 00:42:09,084
If it costs too much,
we charge a penny more.

897
00:42:09,117 --> 00:42:11,752
Would you pay more
to save fish who thinks?

898
00:42:11,786 --> 00:42:15,123
And we handle
all the lawsuits that way.

899
00:42:15,156 --> 00:42:16,657
Let other teams
build power plants

900
00:42:16,691 --> 00:42:18,259
in the wrong places.

901
00:42:18,293 --> 00:42:21,462
Let the other quarterback
throw a gurgle out

902
00:42:21,496 --> 00:42:23,431
so newspapers
get ahold of it.

903
00:42:23,464 --> 00:42:25,466
Let's be the team
that makes the rules.

904
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,403
Let us be the team
that plays fair.

905
00:42:28,436 --> 00:42:30,771
Let's be
the popular players.

906
00:42:30,805 --> 00:42:33,574
We'll have to forget
these nuclear power plants

907
00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:35,576
until we know
they're safe.

908
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:37,345
That refinery
in Pagglesham,

909
00:42:37,378 --> 00:42:39,347
we'll have
to relocate it.

910
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:41,349
It'll cost us $35 million,

911
00:42:41,382 --> 00:42:44,119
but we're going
to come out ahead.

912
00:42:44,152 --> 00:42:46,687
Whatever that stuff is
we're making, that plastic,

913
00:42:46,721 --> 00:42:48,289
we'll have to stop.

914
00:42:48,323 --> 00:42:51,326
We're not in here
for just one game, are we?

915
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:52,727
We're going all the way.

916
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,729
Let's get
to the super bowl!

917
00:42:54,762 --> 00:42:57,498
When we get there,
let's already have won!

918
00:43:22,157 --> 00:43:23,524
Hi. How you doing?

919
00:43:23,558 --> 00:43:25,526
Oh, just fine.
Thank you.

920
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,595
Very well. Mm-hmm.
I'm just...

921
00:43:27,628 --> 00:43:29,264
What is happening?

922
00:43:29,297 --> 00:43:31,532
...And give the rams
home field advantage

923
00:43:31,566 --> 00:43:33,534
through the playoffs
and the super bowl.

924
00:43:33,568 --> 00:43:36,237
This super bowl
is set for the coliseum.

925
00:43:36,271 --> 00:43:39,274
If he weren't going
to be dead soon,

926
00:43:39,307 --> 00:43:41,676
he'd need years
of psychiatric help.

927
00:43:41,709 --> 00:43:43,778
Let's do it tonight.

928
00:43:43,811 --> 00:43:45,780
The rams will probably
face Dallas

929
00:43:45,813 --> 00:43:48,383
in the opening round
of the playoffs.

930
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:49,650
If they win--

931
00:43:49,684 --> 00:43:50,751
Mr. Pendleton.

932
00:43:50,785 --> 00:43:52,220
Hey!

933
00:43:52,253 --> 00:43:53,321
...Championship
on the 26th.

934
00:43:53,354 --> 00:43:54,622
Am I glad
to see you.

935
00:43:54,655 --> 00:43:56,457
Line up
any bodies yet?

936
00:43:56,491 --> 00:43:59,327
We haven't got
a lot of time--

937
00:44:00,661 --> 00:44:02,897
uh...the, uh...

938
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,633
...And only
4 measly field goals.

939
00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:06,767
Uh, hi.

940
00:44:06,801 --> 00:44:08,369
I--I'm just...

941
00:44:08,403 --> 00:44:10,371
They're home
against Cincinnati...

942
00:44:30,991 --> 00:44:32,627
What's up?

943
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,530
We have a number of
interesting probabilities.

944
00:44:35,563 --> 00:44:37,532
I kept my word
to Betty Logan.

945
00:44:37,565 --> 00:44:40,235
Did you find a body
in good shape?

946
00:44:40,268 --> 00:44:41,802
I want to see
some bodies.

947
00:44:41,836 --> 00:44:43,238
Ahem.

948
00:44:43,271 --> 00:44:45,640
Somebody with
good legs, good arms.

949
00:44:45,673 --> 00:44:47,642
The super bowl's
coming up.

950
00:44:47,675 --> 00:44:50,645
You must have checked
a lot of bodies--

951
00:44:51,979 --> 00:44:53,548
who is it?

952
00:44:53,581 --> 00:44:56,484
It's sisk, sir.

953
00:44:56,517 --> 00:44:57,885
Come in, sisk.

954
00:45:03,724 --> 00:45:06,694
Sorry to disturb you,
Mr. Farnsworth,

955
00:45:06,727 --> 00:45:08,663
but miss Betty Logan
is downstairs

956
00:45:08,696 --> 00:45:12,633
and asks if she might have
a moment of your time.

957
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,702
Betty l--

958
00:45:14,735 --> 00:45:15,703
uh...

959
00:45:15,736 --> 00:45:17,938
Tell her
I'll be right down.

960
00:45:17,972 --> 00:45:20,207
Ah. Very good, sir.

961
00:45:21,276 --> 00:45:22,743
Do you, uh...

962
00:45:22,777 --> 00:45:25,446
Do you wish
the door closed, sir?

963
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,748
Uh...
Closed is fine.

964
00:45:27,782 --> 00:45:29,484
Thank you.

965
00:45:36,391 --> 00:45:37,925
Do the best
you can do.

966
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:40,495
I got to see
what she wants.

967
00:45:50,505 --> 00:45:52,473
Hi.

968
00:45:52,507 --> 00:45:53,308
Um...

969
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:54,475
Mr. Farnsworth,

970
00:45:54,509 --> 00:45:57,878
I don't know what
you must think of me

971
00:45:57,912 --> 00:46:00,881
after my behavior
at our first meeting,

972
00:46:00,915 --> 00:46:03,884
but I feel
I must tell you

973
00:46:03,918 --> 00:46:06,954
what an extraordinary thing
it is you did today.

974
00:46:06,987 --> 00:46:08,956
You don't
have to say--

975
00:46:08,989 --> 00:46:09,957
no, it's...

976
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:11,559
Because i--i--

977
00:46:11,592 --> 00:46:12,960
you know what? Uh...

978
00:46:12,993 --> 00:46:14,962
You look
a little pale.

979
00:46:14,995 --> 00:46:16,964
You want
something to eat?

980
00:46:16,997 --> 00:46:18,466
I'll be right back.

981
00:46:18,499 --> 00:46:19,700
Bentley. Everett.

982
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:22,703
Miss Logan's going to
have dinner with us,

983
00:46:22,737 --> 00:46:24,705
so put on another plate.

984
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:27,308
Whip up
a liver and whey shake.

985
00:46:27,342 --> 00:46:28,709
Where you going?

986
00:46:28,743 --> 00:46:30,311
Oh, I thought...

987
00:46:30,345 --> 00:46:33,314
You thought
I meant to go out.

988
00:46:33,348 --> 00:46:34,715
Sisk, we're going out.

989
00:46:34,749 --> 00:46:35,716
Come on.

990
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:36,717
Bentley! Everett!

991
00:46:36,751 --> 00:46:38,719
We're going out and eat.

992
00:46:38,753 --> 00:46:40,721
Which hat
would you prefer?

993
00:46:40,755 --> 00:46:43,724
Look, I don't want
to wear a hat.

994
00:46:43,758 --> 00:46:45,326
I'm sick of hats.

995
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,995
Don't show me
any more hats.

996
00:46:48,028 --> 00:46:49,730
Yes, sir.

997
00:46:49,764 --> 00:46:51,566
No more hats.

998
00:47:06,481 --> 00:47:08,783
It's, uh...

999
00:47:12,086 --> 00:47:15,055
Do you eat here often?

1000
00:47:16,156 --> 00:47:19,427
Are you--nah, look...

1001
00:47:21,429 --> 00:47:23,798
I didn't think
you'd want people

1002
00:47:23,831 --> 00:47:26,901
to see you out
with a guy like me.

1003
00:47:28,002 --> 00:47:29,604
I see.

1004
00:47:46,821 --> 00:47:48,823
Pick up 24.
Pick up 28.

1005
00:47:48,856 --> 00:47:49,957
I'm sorry.

1006
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:53,928
I just can't
stop staring at you.

1007
00:48:00,435 --> 00:48:03,571
I seem to be staring
at you, too.

1008
00:48:10,144 --> 00:48:13,113
Even when I was
trying to hate you,

1009
00:48:13,147 --> 00:48:15,716
I couldn't help
seeing something else,

1010
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:16,717
something...

1011
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:18,052
What?

1012
00:48:18,085 --> 00:48:21,522
In your eyes.
Does that sound silly?

1013
00:48:25,593 --> 00:48:27,562
When you see
something like that,

1014
00:48:27,595 --> 00:48:28,563
it doesn't matter
what a person looks like

1015
00:48:28,596 --> 00:48:30,130
or who they are
or anything.

1016
00:48:35,703 --> 00:48:37,204
What is it?

1017
00:48:37,237 --> 00:48:42,076
This isn't what I thought
was going to happen to me.

1018
00:48:45,613 --> 00:48:48,983
Listen, I got to talk
to somebody right away.

1019
00:48:49,016 --> 00:48:52,520
Would you mind
if I took you home?

1020
00:49:00,761 --> 00:49:01,729
Uh...

1021
00:49:01,762 --> 00:49:03,564
I, uh...

1022
00:49:03,598 --> 00:49:04,565
Good night.

1023
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:06,734
Good--good night.

1024
00:49:08,035 --> 00:49:09,737
Oh, hey, by the way,

1025
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:11,171
I'm getting a divorce.

1026
00:49:11,205 --> 00:49:14,609
But you and your wife
aren't even separated.

1027
00:49:14,642 --> 00:49:17,177
Oh, sure, we are.
It's a big house.

1028
00:49:17,211 --> 00:49:18,779
Oh.

1029
00:49:39,867 --> 00:49:42,269
Hey! How you
doing, Bentley?

1030
00:49:42,302 --> 00:49:43,838
Fine, sir.

1031
00:49:45,773 --> 00:49:47,675
Mr. Pendleton?

1032
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:48,676
Oh.

1033
00:49:48,709 --> 00:49:49,877
Hi.

1034
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:51,178
Uh...

1035
00:49:56,884 --> 00:49:58,853
I don't
want that body

1036
00:49:58,886 --> 00:50:00,254
we've been
talking about.

1037
00:50:00,287 --> 00:50:01,889
Something
happened tonight.

1038
00:50:01,922 --> 00:50:03,290
This is an outrage.

1039
00:50:03,323 --> 00:50:05,225
We've gone to
enormous difficulties

1040
00:50:05,259 --> 00:50:06,827
to find you an athlete.

1041
00:50:06,861 --> 00:50:09,029
I wanted it,
but that was before.

1042
00:50:09,063 --> 00:50:11,031
Something happened
with Betty Logan.

1043
00:50:11,065 --> 00:50:13,634
I changed my mind,
that's all.

1044
00:50:13,668 --> 00:50:15,936
I'll get Farnsworth's
body into shape.

1045
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:17,772
I'll get corkle
to help me...

1046
00:50:17,805 --> 00:50:19,139
Back in there, eh?

1047
00:50:19,173 --> 00:50:20,140
Oh, yes.

1048
00:50:20,174 --> 00:50:21,842
I can do it.

1049
00:50:21,876 --> 00:50:24,011
I know more about getting
into shape than anybody.

1050
00:50:24,044 --> 00:50:26,681
So hold up on that body.

1051
00:50:26,714 --> 00:50:28,148
Hold up on the body?

1052
00:50:28,182 --> 00:50:30,818
Tell Mr. Jordan
not to worry about it.

1053
00:50:30,851 --> 00:50:32,820
Thank him.
I'm very sorry.

1054
00:50:32,853 --> 00:50:34,722
I want to get into shape
with this body.

1055
00:50:34,755 --> 00:50:36,123
You leave me speechless.

1056
00:50:36,156 --> 00:50:38,626
I have nothing
to say to that.

1057
00:50:38,659 --> 00:50:41,028
I can't even think
how to retort

1058
00:50:41,061 --> 00:50:44,699
to something as ridiculous
as turning down a body

1059
00:50:44,732 --> 00:50:46,033
we've gone
to such extremes to find,

1060
00:50:46,066 --> 00:50:49,036
and an athlete at that,
in prime condition.

1061
00:50:49,069 --> 00:50:50,605
I don't
know what to say.

1062
00:50:50,638 --> 00:50:53,007
What do I do
with his cocoa?

1063
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,009
I don't want
to disturb him,

1064
00:50:55,042 --> 00:50:56,611
but it'll get cold.

1065
00:50:56,644 --> 00:50:58,613
I notice
there are 2 cups.

1066
00:50:58,646 --> 00:51:01,616
Sisk felt since
he was pretending

1067
00:51:01,649 --> 00:51:03,017
to talk to somebody,

1068
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:06,621
he might want to pretend
to give him cocoa, too.

1069
00:51:06,654 --> 00:51:08,022
Hey, how you doing, Everett?

1070
00:51:08,055 --> 00:51:10,124
How you doing, Bentley?

1071
00:51:15,696 --> 00:51:17,064
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1072
00:51:17,097 --> 00:51:20,167
Wait a minute.
Just a minute, please.

1073
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,235
All right.

1074
00:51:21,268 --> 00:51:22,837
I'm sorry to bother you,

1075
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:24,839
but we don't love
each other,

1076
00:51:24,872 --> 00:51:26,641
so let's get divorced.

1077
00:51:26,674 --> 00:51:30,110
Leo, I don't know
what you're talking about.

1078
00:51:30,144 --> 00:51:31,712
Come on. Yes, you do.

1079
00:51:31,746 --> 00:51:33,714
Abbott, there's
a trainer for the rams

1080
00:51:33,748 --> 00:51:35,282
named Max corkle.

1081
00:51:35,315 --> 00:51:39,086
Could you call and ask
him to come see me?

1082
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,721
Yes, Mr. Farnsworth.

1083
00:51:40,755 --> 00:51:41,722
Thank you.

1084
00:51:41,756 --> 00:51:43,157
Good night.

1085
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:45,159
You idiot! You idiot!

1086
00:51:45,192 --> 00:51:47,161
Why did you answer him?

1087
00:51:47,194 --> 00:51:50,030
I couldn't resist.
His will is too strong.

1088
00:51:50,064 --> 00:51:51,632
That's
our weekend forecast.

1089
00:51:51,666 --> 00:51:54,635
Now here's Bryant gumbel
with tonight's sports.

1090
00:51:54,669 --> 00:51:58,072
Leach and char
will have to--

1091
00:51:58,105 --> 00:51:59,073
he's dead.

1092
00:51:59,106 --> 00:52:00,941
It's over with.

1093
00:52:00,975 --> 00:52:02,710
...Left for Philadelphia
this morning,

1094
00:52:02,743 --> 00:52:04,044
hoping to play
their last road--

1095
00:52:05,946 --> 00:52:07,214
at last,
at last.

1096
00:52:07,247 --> 00:52:09,383
At last,
my dearest.

1097
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:10,384
It's incredible.

1098
00:52:14,054 --> 00:52:17,391
Yes! Just a minute. Yes!

1099
00:52:17,424 --> 00:52:18,659
Yes, sisk.

1100
00:52:18,693 --> 00:52:20,027
And, uh, abbott,

1101
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:23,397
corkle's number
is 654-1654.

1102
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:24,999
Yes, Mr. Farnsworth.

1103
00:52:25,032 --> 00:52:27,668
Ok.

1104
00:52:27,702 --> 00:52:29,770
Oh, my god.

1105
00:52:29,804 --> 00:52:31,171
Right this way.

1106
00:52:31,205 --> 00:52:33,774
Mr. Farnsworth
is waiting for you

1107
00:52:33,808 --> 00:52:35,175
in the ballroom.

1108
00:52:35,209 --> 00:52:36,744
Follow me, please.

1109
00:52:45,352 --> 00:52:47,254
Mr. Corkle, sir.

1110
00:52:47,287 --> 00:52:48,322
Max.

1111
00:52:48,355 --> 00:52:50,290
How you doing?

1112
00:52:51,491 --> 00:52:52,893
Fine.

1113
00:52:54,061 --> 00:52:55,462
Max...

1114
00:52:55,495 --> 00:52:57,865
Hey, lost a little
weight, huh?

1115
00:52:59,366 --> 00:53:00,935
Have we met?

1116
00:53:00,968 --> 00:53:02,336
Uh, sort of. Yeah.

1117
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:04,071
Thanks, sisk.

1118
00:53:04,104 --> 00:53:05,072
Hey.

1119
00:53:05,105 --> 00:53:07,041
Max, ha!

1120
00:53:07,074 --> 00:53:09,744
Hey.
I hear you got

1121
00:53:09,777 --> 00:53:11,746
all Joe Pendleton's
athletic equipment.

1122
00:53:11,779 --> 00:53:13,748
Yeah. How'd you
know that?

1123
00:53:13,781 --> 00:53:16,050
I'd like to buy it
from you.

1124
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:18,753
I'd like to
bring it in here.

1125
00:53:18,786 --> 00:53:20,154
No, I'm sorry,
Mr. Farnsworth.

1126
00:53:20,187 --> 00:53:21,321
That's not for sale.

1127
00:53:21,355 --> 00:53:22,322
No?

1128
00:53:22,356 --> 00:53:23,924
What do you want it for?

1129
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:26,927
I'd like you
to help me train.

1130
00:53:26,961 --> 00:53:27,962
Oh, train?

1131
00:53:27,995 --> 00:53:30,197
Yeah. As soon as
I'm ready...

1132
00:53:32,967 --> 00:53:36,336
I want you to get me
a tryout with the rams.

1133
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:39,339
I don't understand.
What are you trying out for?

1134
00:53:39,373 --> 00:53:40,340
Quarterback.

1135
00:53:40,374 --> 00:53:41,742
Quarterback.

1136
00:53:45,212 --> 00:53:48,783
Yeah, well, the point is,
Mr. Farnsworth,

1137
00:53:48,816 --> 00:53:51,485
we already got a quarterback
working with the team.

1138
00:53:51,518 --> 00:53:54,789
We got a couple
of pretty good backups.

1139
00:53:54,822 --> 00:53:56,791
You call Hodges
good, huh?

1140
00:53:56,824 --> 00:54:01,228
The point is we don't
need a quarterback.

1141
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:04,198
Look, why don't you try
one of the other teams?

1142
00:54:04,231 --> 00:54:05,365
The Oakland raiders
are pretty close to L.A.

1143
00:54:05,399 --> 00:54:07,267
Give them a call
and see what they say.

1144
00:54:07,301 --> 00:54:09,269
I want to
get in shape

1145
00:54:09,303 --> 00:54:11,271
in time
for the super bowl.

1146
00:54:11,305 --> 00:54:13,507
What would it cost
to try out?

1147
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:18,412
Look, Mr. Farnsworth,
no team wants a crazy trainer,

1148
00:54:18,445 --> 00:54:21,515
and only a crazy trainer
would arrange a tryout for you.

1149
00:54:21,548 --> 00:54:24,518
You keep your money,
I'll keep my job,

1150
00:54:24,551 --> 00:54:27,421
and we'll keep this little
misunderstanding to ourselves.

1151
00:54:27,454 --> 00:54:30,424
Hey, listen--
that's all right.

1152
00:54:30,457 --> 00:54:32,026
I'll finish that up.

1153
00:54:32,059 --> 00:54:35,029
What would you say
if I told you

1154
00:54:35,062 --> 00:54:37,431
I was a professional
football player?

1155
00:54:37,464 --> 00:54:41,135
Boy, hey, these--
these are nice.

1156
00:54:41,168 --> 00:54:42,136
Max...

1157
00:54:42,169 --> 00:54:44,404
You know
how people die?

1158
00:54:44,438 --> 00:54:48,075
Yeah. Why?

1159
00:54:48,108 --> 00:54:50,945
And after they die,
they go to heaven?

1160
00:54:50,978 --> 00:54:53,347
I guess,
if--if they're good.

1161
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,082
I mean, why not?

1162
00:54:56,383 --> 00:54:59,353
You know how it
works in heaven?

1163
00:54:59,386 --> 00:55:00,855
Not exactly.

1164
00:55:00,888 --> 00:55:01,956
It's probability
and outcome.

1165
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:03,490
Probability
and outcome.

1166
00:55:03,523 --> 00:55:05,092
Probability
and outcome.

1167
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:06,460
I never knew that.

1168
00:55:06,493 --> 00:55:08,062
Let's say there's
a probability

1169
00:55:08,095 --> 00:55:09,930
that some guy's
going to die.

1170
00:55:09,964 --> 00:55:11,598
What happens is
an escort

1171
00:55:11,631 --> 00:55:13,467
from his way station
gets a signal.

1172
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:15,970
He goes down and waits
for the outcome.

1173
00:55:16,003 --> 00:55:18,839
If the guy lives,
he wasted a trip.

1174
00:55:18,873 --> 00:55:21,375
If he dies,
he picks him up

1175
00:55:21,408 --> 00:55:23,978
and takes him back
to his way station.

1176
00:55:24,011 --> 00:55:26,981
He puts him in line for
his final destination.

1177
00:55:27,014 --> 00:55:28,182
Mind if I smoke?

1178
00:55:28,215 --> 00:55:29,249
Go ahead.

1179
00:55:29,283 --> 00:55:31,251
Let's say there's
a new escort.

1180
00:55:31,285 --> 00:55:32,853
He gets a signal.

1181
00:55:32,887 --> 00:55:34,855
He takes off
and sees a guy

1182
00:55:34,889 --> 00:55:36,857
riding a bicycle
into a tunnel.

1183
00:55:36,891 --> 00:55:38,859
The car's coming
the other way.

1184
00:55:38,893 --> 00:55:40,995
He's supposed to wait
for the outcome,

1185
00:55:41,028 --> 00:55:44,398
but he's new and figures
the guy's a goner.

1186
00:55:44,431 --> 00:55:47,401
He figures, why should I
have the car hit him?

1187
00:55:47,434 --> 00:55:50,404
Why not take him out
a few seconds early

1188
00:55:50,437 --> 00:55:53,407
and take him
up to his way station?

1189
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,176
Listen, I, uh...
Need a match.

1190
00:55:56,210 --> 00:55:58,178
That clock,
that's a lighter.

1191
00:55:58,212 --> 00:56:00,180
So the thing is,

1192
00:56:00,214 --> 00:56:02,182
the guy he takes up
to the way station

1193
00:56:02,216 --> 00:56:04,184
isn't just
some ordinary guy.

1194
00:56:04,218 --> 00:56:06,586
He's an athlete with
fantastic reflexes.

1195
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:10,590
He wouldn't have hit
the car at all, see?

1196
00:56:10,624 --> 00:56:12,592
How do you
light this?

1197
00:56:12,626 --> 00:56:15,195
The guy
wasn't really dead.

1198
00:56:15,229 --> 00:56:17,597
His number
wasn't up for years.

1199
00:56:17,631 --> 00:56:19,599
He would have
missed the car.

1200
00:56:19,633 --> 00:56:22,402
Look at the time.
Is this lighter right?

1201
00:56:22,436 --> 00:56:25,405
They're supposed to put
him back in his body,

1202
00:56:25,439 --> 00:56:27,007
but they can't 'cause
he's been cremated.

1203
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:30,010
They have to find
another body for him.

1204
00:56:30,044 --> 00:56:33,013
Now, look, Mr. Farnsworth,
I'm just a trainer.

1205
00:56:33,047 --> 00:56:36,316
What you need is
like a really good doctor.

1206
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:38,452
Don't you understand
what I'm trying to say?

1207
00:56:38,485 --> 00:56:41,055
Sure. That's
a hell of a story.

1208
00:56:41,088 --> 00:56:42,456
Max, you--
Mr. Jordan.

1209
00:56:42,489 --> 00:56:45,025
I'm so glad
to see you.

1210
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:47,027
I'm trying to
get Farnsworth

1211
00:56:47,061 --> 00:56:49,029
into shape for
the super bowl.

1212
00:56:49,063 --> 00:56:51,031
I want corkle
to help me.

1213
00:56:51,065 --> 00:56:53,433
Somebody with us?
Who are you talking to?

1214
00:56:53,467 --> 00:56:56,436
Mr. Jordan. He runs
the way station.

1215
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:59,039
You can't see him.
You're still alive.

1216
00:56:59,073 --> 00:57:01,441
You probably got
a lot to talk about.

1217
00:57:01,475 --> 00:57:03,443
I'll be on my way.

1218
00:57:03,477 --> 00:57:05,045
Wait a second, Max.

1219
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:07,447
Tell him
who you are, Joe.

1220
00:57:07,481 --> 00:57:09,316
He's never going to
believe me.

1221
00:57:09,349 --> 00:57:11,451
He's the only
person I know

1222
00:57:11,485 --> 00:57:14,454
who can get me
a tryout with the rams.

1223
00:57:14,488 --> 00:57:16,456
You can make him
believe you.

1224
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:19,459
Max! I'm not Farnsworth.
I'm Joe Pendleton.

1225
00:57:19,493 --> 00:57:21,728
Farnsworth's wife and
secretary murdered him.

1226
00:57:21,761 --> 00:57:25,032
This is just a body
they found for me.

1227
00:57:25,065 --> 00:57:27,234
They drugged him,
stuck him in a bathtub,

1228
00:57:27,267 --> 00:57:28,568
then I stepped in.

1229
00:57:28,602 --> 00:57:33,440
It's not bad material.
I can get it into shape.

1230
00:57:33,473 --> 00:57:34,608
Max, please.

1231
00:57:34,641 --> 00:57:37,611
Look, I really
want to get out of here.

1232
00:57:37,644 --> 00:57:40,080
I won't tell
a word to anybody.

1233
00:57:40,114 --> 00:57:42,482
I promise. It'll be
our little secret.

1234
00:57:42,516 --> 00:57:45,485
Like what you said
about your sister

1235
00:57:45,519 --> 00:57:47,487
and the Coca-Cola
salesman?

1236
00:57:47,521 --> 00:57:49,489
What about
that scar you got

1237
00:57:49,523 --> 00:57:52,092
on the bottom
of your tongue?

1238
00:57:52,126 --> 00:57:55,095
What did you do at
your uncle's wedding?

1239
00:57:55,129 --> 00:57:57,097
What about
the first time

1240
00:57:57,131 --> 00:57:59,466
I fixed your neck
in Pittsburgh?

1241
00:58:02,669 --> 00:58:04,771
Now do you
believe me, Max?

1242
00:58:04,804 --> 00:58:06,773
Please say
you believe me.

1243
00:58:06,806 --> 00:58:09,376
They don't have
a football team in heaven,

1244
00:58:09,409 --> 00:58:11,778
so god couldn't
make me first-string.

1245
00:58:11,811 --> 00:58:13,380
He doesn't believe me,
Mr. Jordan.

1246
00:58:13,413 --> 00:58:15,382
Try a little
music, Joe.

1247
00:58:15,415 --> 00:58:17,084
That's a great
persuader.

1248
00:58:29,829 --> 00:58:33,200
Joe, you never could
play that thing.

1249
00:58:34,468 --> 00:58:35,669
Joe.

1250
00:58:38,305 --> 00:58:39,673
You all right, Max?

1251
00:58:39,706 --> 00:58:42,142
Max...
You all right?

1252
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,447
Sisk!

1253
00:58:47,481 --> 00:58:48,448
Everett!

1254
00:58:48,482 --> 00:58:49,683
Bentley!

1255
00:58:49,716 --> 00:58:52,152
Whip up a liver and whey
shake right away!

1256
00:58:54,721 --> 00:58:57,291
I'm gonna play quarterback
in the super bowl.

1257
00:58:57,324 --> 00:58:59,693
And nothing can change that,
right, Mr. Jordan?

1258
00:58:59,726 --> 00:59:02,296
If that's what you've
got coming to you.

1259
00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:03,597
He's still here?

1260
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:04,764
Right there.

1261
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:06,366
Max, listen to me.

1262
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,235
Farnsworth isn't
in bad shape.

1263
00:59:08,268 --> 00:59:10,237
I still know
the moves.

1264
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:12,306
Just help me
with the body.

1265
00:59:12,339 --> 00:59:14,574
Thanks, Mr. Jordan.

1266
00:59:17,877 --> 00:59:20,847
Sisk! How about that
liver and whey shake?

1267
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,449
Hurry up. Hurry up.

1268
00:59:22,482 --> 00:59:24,451
I need it
for Mr. Corkle.

1269
00:59:24,484 --> 00:59:25,852
Yes, sir.
Right away.

1270
00:59:25,885 --> 00:59:28,455
I want the whole staff
to suit up.

1271
00:59:28,488 --> 00:59:30,157
We're going
into training.

1272
00:59:35,762 --> 00:59:39,733
Uh, listen,
Mr., uh...Jordan, is it?

1273
00:59:39,766 --> 00:59:41,168
Huh?

1274
00:59:42,369 --> 00:59:45,205
You still there?

1275
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:48,608
Uh, anytime
you want to chime in...

1276
00:59:48,642 --> 00:59:50,477
Why, just feel free.

1277
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:54,148
Feel free. I'm telling you
to feel free.

1278
00:59:54,181 --> 00:59:57,151
You got to help me
talk Joe out of this.

1279
00:59:57,184 --> 01:00:00,154
If I do get him a tryout,

1280
01:00:00,187 --> 01:00:04,158
that team will put him
out of commission like that.

1281
01:00:04,191 --> 01:00:06,893
Christ, I can't even
snap my fingers anymore.

1282
01:00:06,926 --> 01:00:08,895
Oh, sorry.

1283
01:00:08,928 --> 01:00:10,864
He's not there, Max.

1284
01:00:12,432 --> 01:00:14,768
Don't get crazy on me.
I'm counting on you.

1285
01:00:55,875 --> 01:00:58,144
This just
isn't going to work.

1286
01:01:04,218 --> 01:01:06,286
These are the L.A. rams
we're fooling with.

1287
01:01:12,326 --> 01:01:14,661
It--it's just--
well, all right.

1288
01:01:25,772 --> 01:01:28,475
I'm still figuring out
what I'll say. I...

1289
01:01:47,927 --> 01:01:50,497
You're playing football
with a bunch of butlers.

1290
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:52,899
We're in the super bowl.
This won't work.

1291
01:01:52,932 --> 01:01:55,502
Don't worry.
I fixed all that.

1292
01:01:55,535 --> 01:01:56,503
How?

1293
01:01:56,536 --> 01:01:58,204
I bought the rams.

1294
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:03,277
Leo Farnsworth has
bought this team,

1295
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:05,679
and he wants
to play quarterback.

1296
01:02:05,712 --> 01:02:06,680
Shit!

1297
01:02:06,713 --> 01:02:08,282
Crazy son of a bitch.

1298
01:02:08,315 --> 01:02:09,916
We won't take
this bullshit, coach.

1299
01:02:09,949 --> 01:02:11,885
Wait a minute.
Listen, fellas.

1300
01:02:11,918 --> 01:02:13,887
This is the way it is.

1301
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,490
He'll play quarterback
in Wednesday's scrimmage.

1302
01:02:16,523 --> 01:02:18,992
At which time, he and
the coach will decide

1303
01:02:19,025 --> 01:02:21,995
whether he's qualified
for the job or not.

1304
01:02:22,028 --> 01:02:25,465
Mr. Farnsworth says,
"tell no one to hold back."

1305
01:02:25,499 --> 01:02:26,966
These were his words.

1306
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,869
"Let's play that scrimmage
like the super bowl."

1307
01:02:29,903 --> 01:02:31,471
Take him at his word.

1308
01:02:31,505 --> 01:02:32,839
Let's kill him.

1309
01:02:35,509 --> 01:02:36,543
My team.

1310
01:02:36,576 --> 01:02:39,779
That son of a bitch
got my team.

1311
01:02:39,813 --> 01:02:42,782
What kind of pressure
did he use, milt?

1312
01:02:42,816 --> 01:02:46,486
Well, I asked for
67 million, and...

1313
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,422
He said, "ok."

1314
01:02:49,523 --> 01:02:51,425
Ruthless bastard.

1315
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:06,406
Well, very, very nice.

1316
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,907
Very, very, impressive.

1317
01:03:07,941 --> 01:03:09,443
I'm Tony abbott,

1318
01:03:09,476 --> 01:03:12,412
Mr. Farnsworth's
personal secretary.

1319
01:03:12,446 --> 01:03:14,781
Very nice.
Very...Very nice.

1320
01:03:14,814 --> 01:03:16,783
Don't let any
of Mr. Farnsworth's

1321
01:03:16,816 --> 01:03:19,619
racial statements
offend you,

1322
01:03:19,653 --> 01:03:21,321
for god's sakes.

1323
01:03:22,789 --> 01:03:24,724
Nice--nice talking
to you.

1324
01:03:52,952 --> 01:03:56,055
Get rid of that ball
fast, all right?

1325
01:03:56,089 --> 01:03:57,991
Good luck,
Mr. Farnsworth.

1326
01:04:01,961 --> 01:04:04,531
All right, don't worry
about the plays.

1327
01:04:04,564 --> 01:04:06,933
I think I got them down
last night.

1328
01:04:06,966 --> 01:04:08,935
I want to run
a split right, x-go,

1329
01:04:08,968 --> 01:04:11,905
z-curl, a y-straight.

1330
01:04:11,938 --> 01:04:14,007
Like the super bowl.
Break.

1331
01:04:21,147 --> 01:04:23,016
Ready? Break.

1332
01:04:25,552 --> 01:04:27,487
Look at gorman
and kowalsky.

1333
01:04:27,521 --> 01:04:30,624
That's how they look
when they eat.

1334
01:04:34,561 --> 01:04:35,929
4-3, set!

1335
01:04:35,962 --> 01:04:37,030
Hut!

1336
01:04:38,197 --> 01:04:39,599
2-85!

1337
01:04:39,633 --> 01:04:41,000
2-85!

1338
01:04:42,168 --> 01:04:43,503
Hut.

1339
01:04:50,043 --> 01:04:51,878
Sorry, Mr. Farnsworth.

1340
01:04:55,849 --> 01:04:56,950
Nice.

1341
01:04:56,983 --> 01:04:59,018
Let's try it again,
Mr. Farnsworth.

1342
01:05:02,121 --> 01:05:04,090
Ok, get him
back in there.

1343
01:05:04,123 --> 01:05:05,625
Let's go!
Let's go!

1344
01:05:05,659 --> 01:05:07,694
Try it with the ball!

1345
01:05:07,727 --> 01:05:09,095
Come on, positions!

1346
01:05:09,128 --> 01:05:12,832
Playing football
is so much fun.

1347
01:05:12,866 --> 01:05:13,833
Set!

1348
01:05:13,867 --> 01:05:15,435
Come on now!

1349
01:05:15,469 --> 01:05:17,003
2-81!

1350
01:05:17,036 --> 01:05:18,738
2-81!

1351
01:05:18,772 --> 01:05:19,739
Hut!

1352
01:05:19,773 --> 01:05:20,740
Hut!

1353
01:05:20,774 --> 01:05:21,741
Hut!

1354
01:05:21,775 --> 01:05:22,742
Hut!

1355
01:05:22,776 --> 01:05:23,977
Hut--

1356
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:32,819
I'm terribly sorry,
Mr. Farnsworth.

1357
01:05:32,852 --> 01:05:34,220
This is really
embarrassing.

1358
01:05:34,253 --> 01:05:35,922
Help him up.

1359
01:05:38,725 --> 01:05:40,827
I guess
you went offsides.

1360
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:42,228
Come on, guys,

1361
01:05:42,261 --> 01:05:44,230
get him,
get him, get him.

1362
01:05:44,263 --> 01:05:48,101
Give me a little
more room, Billy.

1363
01:05:48,134 --> 01:05:50,103
Set!

1364
01:05:50,136 --> 01:05:53,072
Let's all try
and stay onsides.

1365
01:05:53,106 --> 01:05:54,708
2-85!

1366
01:05:54,741 --> 01:05:55,942
Hut!

1367
01:05:57,644 --> 01:05:58,945
Better get a stretcher.

1368
01:05:58,978 --> 01:05:59,979
Jesus!

1369
01:06:00,013 --> 01:06:01,948
Look, Harry,
he's an eccentric.

1370
01:06:01,981 --> 01:06:03,950
We've always known that
about Farnsworth.

1371
01:06:03,983 --> 01:06:06,553
Buying a football
team for 67 million

1372
01:06:06,586 --> 01:06:08,955
that has
a book value of 19?

1373
01:06:08,988 --> 01:06:11,558
3 weeks ago,
the stock sold at 56.

1374
01:06:11,591 --> 01:06:14,027
This morning
it opened at 14.

1375
01:06:16,596 --> 01:06:19,566
You want a rest,
Mr. Farnsworth?

1376
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:21,034
No, no, it's ok.

1377
01:06:21,067 --> 01:06:24,037
Mr. Leo Farnsworth intends
to take the Los Angeles rams

1378
01:06:24,070 --> 01:06:27,574
to the super bowl this season
as their quarterback.

1379
01:06:27,607 --> 01:06:29,976
No sign of aberration
in his behavior?

1380
01:06:30,009 --> 01:06:32,579
Nothing in his personal
life bothering him?

1381
01:06:32,612 --> 01:06:34,981
I think this statement
speaks for itself.

1382
01:06:35,014 --> 01:06:36,182
All right,

1383
01:06:36,215 --> 01:06:38,818
I'm going to save you guys
some trouble.

1384
01:06:38,852 --> 01:06:40,219
Want me to quit?

1385
01:06:40,253 --> 01:06:42,155
Give me the ball once.

1386
01:06:42,188 --> 01:06:44,658
If I don't hit Evans,
I'll quit.

1387
01:06:44,691 --> 01:06:45,925
Ready? Break!

1388
01:06:52,932 --> 01:06:54,968
Hey, now!

1389
01:06:55,001 --> 01:06:56,069
On 3!

1390
01:06:56,102 --> 01:06:57,170
Set!

1391
01:06:57,203 --> 01:06:58,504
Hut!

1392
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:05,779
Beautiful! Ha ha ha!

1393
01:07:06,980 --> 01:07:09,916
There's a potential there,
huh? He's...

1394
01:07:12,318 --> 01:07:13,319
Ok, ok.

1395
01:07:13,352 --> 01:07:15,555
Take it easy,
Mr. Farnsworth.

1396
01:07:15,589 --> 01:07:16,556
I know.

1397
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:18,558
Shit, man,
what you doing?

1398
01:07:18,592 --> 01:07:19,959
What's he doing?

1399
01:07:19,993 --> 01:07:21,961
Ready? Break.

1400
01:07:21,995 --> 01:07:24,898
Red right, red right.
Watch the pass.

1401
01:07:24,931 --> 01:07:25,932
4-3.

1402
01:07:25,965 --> 01:07:27,667
Set! 3!

1403
01:07:27,701 --> 01:07:28,768
Hut!

1404
01:07:38,645 --> 01:07:40,146
1-81!
Hut!

1405
01:07:47,921 --> 01:07:50,657
I think we got us
a rich quarterback.

1406
01:08:05,872 --> 01:08:07,874
He's looking
awful good.

1407
01:08:14,681 --> 01:08:16,650
Boy,
you pulled it off.

1408
01:08:16,683 --> 01:08:18,384
You really
pulled it off.

1409
01:08:18,417 --> 01:08:21,320
Yeah? I don't know.
I think I can do it.

1410
01:08:22,856 --> 01:08:25,725
Hey, Mr. Farnsworth,
play any college ball?

1411
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:28,227
No. I played
a little Polo.

1412
01:08:37,103 --> 01:08:38,638
Look, look, look.

1413
01:08:38,672 --> 01:08:41,007
He brought the whole
goddamn team home.

1414
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:43,009
That's not
a football team.

1415
01:08:43,042 --> 01:08:45,645
There are older men
and skinny younger men.

1416
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:47,046
Look at the women.

1417
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:48,648
That's
the ecology group

1418
01:08:48,682 --> 01:08:50,650
that exo-grey
is funding.

1419
01:08:50,684 --> 01:08:53,653
He's getting ready to
spring some kind of a trap.

1420
01:08:53,687 --> 01:08:56,022
This whole thing--
the football team gag,

1421
01:08:56,055 --> 01:08:58,024
the ecology crap,
the divorce bit--

1422
01:08:58,057 --> 01:09:00,026
it's all part
of some plot.

1423
01:09:00,059 --> 01:09:02,028
The minute he announces
our divorce,

1424
01:09:02,061 --> 01:09:05,031
I'll be the first suspect
when we kill him.

1425
01:09:05,064 --> 01:09:07,767
Darling, perhaps
I'm just being silly,

1426
01:09:07,801 --> 01:09:09,435
but I'd be
much more comfortable--

1427
01:09:09,468 --> 01:09:12,205
have I offended you
in some way?

1428
01:09:13,472 --> 01:09:16,409
Don't put your hand
over my mouth again.

1429
01:09:16,442 --> 01:09:18,444
I'm sorry, darling.
You used to like it.

1430
01:09:18,477 --> 01:09:20,780
If we don't do something,
we'll lose it all.

1431
01:09:20,814 --> 01:09:22,782
I should have
my head examined

1432
01:09:22,816 --> 01:09:24,450
for signing
a prenuptial agreement.

1433
01:09:24,483 --> 01:09:26,452
I'll wind up with my wardrobe
and some allowance.

1434
01:09:26,485 --> 01:09:28,454
You'll be fired
without references.

1435
01:09:28,487 --> 01:09:30,056
We'll still have
each other.

1436
01:09:30,089 --> 01:09:32,225
Not after the last 2 murders.
Don't you try it.

1437
01:09:55,982 --> 01:09:58,251
The problem is,
if a neighbor's tree

1438
01:09:58,284 --> 01:10:01,821
is in the way
of the sewer...

1439
01:11:23,602 --> 01:11:25,872
Want to make a wish?

1440
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:27,907
Yes.

1441
01:11:27,941 --> 01:11:29,843
All right.

1442
01:11:29,876 --> 01:11:31,444
There.

1443
01:11:31,477 --> 01:11:33,179
Go ahead.

1444
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:36,282
Hey, very good.

1445
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:47,226
Hey.

1446
01:11:47,260 --> 01:11:48,494
Uh...

1447
01:11:48,527 --> 01:11:51,097
Tell me, do you
think it's silly,

1448
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:53,499
me trying to be
a football player?

1449
01:11:53,532 --> 01:11:55,234
Of course not.
That's what you want.

1450
01:11:55,268 --> 01:11:57,536
You think
I can do it?

1451
01:11:57,570 --> 01:12:00,039
I think you could do
anything you wanted.

1452
01:12:00,073 --> 01:12:03,442
Anything you committed
to do you could do.

1453
01:12:03,476 --> 01:12:06,345
'Cause I'm a big wheel
at exo-grey.

1454
01:12:06,379 --> 01:12:08,948
It's 'cause you're
not afraid of things.

1455
01:12:08,982 --> 01:12:10,249
Afraid of things?

1456
01:12:10,283 --> 01:12:12,551
Why would I be
afraid?

1457
01:12:13,652 --> 01:12:15,221
Well, you know,

1458
01:12:15,254 --> 01:12:17,957
most people are afraid
of something, aren't they?

1459
01:12:17,991 --> 01:12:22,061
You want to know the
only thing I'm afraid of?

1460
01:12:25,098 --> 01:12:28,334
How I'd feel if I
couldn't be with you.

1461
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:34,440
Then there's nothing
to be afraid of, is there?

1462
01:12:36,109 --> 01:12:37,610
Got to go.

1463
01:12:37,643 --> 01:12:39,412
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1464
01:12:39,445 --> 01:12:40,546
I'd--the--

1465
01:12:40,579 --> 01:12:44,183
how would you feel
about marrying me?

1466
01:12:50,389 --> 01:12:52,959
It's crazy, huh?

1467
01:12:52,992 --> 01:12:55,494
No, it doesn't sound crazy.

1468
01:12:55,528 --> 01:12:58,131
You know, if--if I...

1469
01:12:58,164 --> 01:12:59,532
What is it?

1470
01:12:59,565 --> 01:13:01,500
What is it?

1471
01:13:01,534 --> 01:13:04,603
Could you wait here?
I'll be right back.

1472
01:13:14,013 --> 01:13:15,381
What do you want?

1473
01:13:15,414 --> 01:13:16,983
I'm sorry,
Mr. Pendleton.

1474
01:13:17,016 --> 01:13:19,385
I'm afraid you won't
be able to use

1475
01:13:19,418 --> 01:13:20,987
Mr. Farnsworth's body
any longer.

1476
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:24,223
What are you
talking about?

1477
01:13:24,257 --> 01:13:25,624
Just what I said--

1478
01:13:25,658 --> 01:13:26,993
your time is up.
You don't fit.

1479
01:13:27,026 --> 01:13:29,128
You said I'd get
to the super bowl.

1480
01:13:29,162 --> 01:13:34,633
You can't do it with
Mr. Farnsworth's body.

1481
01:13:34,667 --> 01:13:35,634
Why not?

1482
01:13:35,668 --> 01:13:37,703
It wasn't meant to be.

1483
01:13:37,736 --> 01:13:38,704
Why not?

1484
01:13:38,737 --> 01:13:40,406
Don't keep saying
"why not?"

1485
01:13:40,439 --> 01:13:42,375
You think I'll pay
for your mistake?

1486
01:13:42,408 --> 01:13:44,210
Look, Mr. Pendleton--

1487
01:13:44,243 --> 01:13:45,611
I'm not talking
to you.

1488
01:13:45,644 --> 01:13:48,614
Tell Mr. Jordan I'd
like to talk to him.

1489
01:13:48,647 --> 01:13:51,117
We'll settle this
once and for all.

1490
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:53,486
Get out of here.
You're bad news.

1491
01:14:00,559 --> 01:14:02,128
Is something wrong?

1492
01:14:02,161 --> 01:14:04,030
Um, no, it's--

1493
01:14:04,063 --> 01:14:07,166
I just got to straighten
something out.

1494
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,402
Maybe I better
walk you to the car.

1495
01:14:09,435 --> 01:14:10,636
Oh.

1496
01:14:26,385 --> 01:14:29,355
Something is wrong,
isn't it?

1497
01:14:29,388 --> 01:14:31,357
I was just thinking,
Betty.

1498
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:35,061
We got a great life
ahead, you and me,

1499
01:14:35,094 --> 01:14:38,664
and nobody's going to
take that away from us.

1500
01:14:38,697 --> 01:14:41,534
Why are you looking
at me like that?

1501
01:14:41,567 --> 01:14:43,536
I'm just
memorizing your face.

1502
01:14:43,569 --> 01:14:46,139
I want to memorize
everything about you.

1503
01:14:46,172 --> 01:14:49,008
No matter what happens,
I won't forget you.

1504
01:14:49,042 --> 01:14:51,210
What's going to happen?

1505
01:14:51,244 --> 01:14:53,012
Nothing's
going to happen.

1506
01:14:53,046 --> 01:14:55,781
You'd never forget me
either, would you?

1507
01:14:55,814 --> 01:14:57,116
No.

1508
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:59,252
That thing you said
you saw in me...

1509
01:14:59,285 --> 01:15:02,255
It was something in
my eyes. Remember?

1510
01:15:02,288 --> 01:15:04,657
If someday somebody
came up to you--

1511
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:06,259
maybe
a football player--

1512
01:15:06,292 --> 01:15:08,661
and he acted like
he'd seen you before,

1513
01:15:08,694 --> 01:15:10,796
you'd notice
that same thing, right?

1514
01:15:10,829 --> 01:15:13,132
You'd give him
a chance, right?

1515
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:15,534
He could even be
a quarterback.

1516
01:15:15,568 --> 01:15:18,337
I don't understand
what you're saying.

1517
01:15:19,405 --> 01:15:21,374
Ahh, I'm just
acting crazy.

1518
01:15:25,544 --> 01:15:26,645
Betty?

1519
01:15:41,194 --> 01:15:42,661
It's all right.

1520
01:15:42,695 --> 01:15:45,364
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

1521
01:16:22,268 --> 01:16:24,437
You must abide
by what is written.

1522
01:16:24,470 --> 01:16:26,139
Why? I don't understand.

1523
01:16:26,172 --> 01:16:28,141
There's a reason
for everything.

1524
01:16:28,174 --> 01:16:30,376
There's always a plan.

1525
01:16:30,409 --> 01:16:32,411
How can I give up
Farnsworth now?

1526
01:16:32,445 --> 01:16:33,712
I'm sorry, Joe.

1527
01:16:33,746 --> 01:16:36,449
You said we'd get
to the super bowl.

1528
01:16:36,482 --> 01:16:37,783
If it's meant to be.

1529
01:16:37,816 --> 01:16:39,385
I'm not leaving.

1530
01:16:39,418 --> 01:16:40,386
Sorry.

1531
01:16:40,419 --> 01:16:42,421
I'm not leaving,
Mr. Jordan.

1532
01:16:42,455 --> 01:16:45,291
Joe, you yourself asked for
a temporary arrangement.

1533
01:16:45,324 --> 01:16:47,560
I never went back
on a deal,

1534
01:16:47,593 --> 01:16:49,462
but I'm doing it now.

1535
01:16:49,495 --> 01:16:51,830
Your destiny
is not in my hands.

1536
01:16:51,864 --> 01:16:53,832
Please don't make it
more difficult.

1537
01:16:53,866 --> 01:16:56,835
I won't. I'm just
not going to do it.

1538
01:16:56,869 --> 01:17:00,206
Joe, you must abide
by what is written.

1539
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:02,641
She loves me,
Mr. Jordan.

1540
01:17:02,675 --> 01:17:05,711
Joe, you must abide
by what is written.

1541
01:17:49,588 --> 01:17:52,958
Don't be afraid, Joe.
There is a plan.

1542
01:17:52,991 --> 01:17:54,793
There's always a plan.

1543
01:17:54,827 --> 01:17:57,263
Mr. Farnsworth?

1544
01:18:03,769 --> 01:18:04,770
Hello, Bentley.

1545
01:18:04,803 --> 01:18:06,672
Have you seen
Mr. Farnsworth?

1546
01:18:06,705 --> 01:18:08,274
No, sir, I haven't.

1547
01:18:08,307 --> 01:18:10,943
Guess I'll just
have to keep looking.

1548
01:18:10,976 --> 01:18:11,944
Yes, sir.

1549
01:18:11,977 --> 01:18:13,246
Joe?

1550
01:18:15,381 --> 01:18:17,616
Joe, you in here?

1551
01:18:23,422 --> 01:18:26,325
Are you in there,
Mr. Farnsworth?

1552
01:18:40,506 --> 01:18:42,408
Yes.

1553
01:18:42,441 --> 01:18:43,609
Yes!

1554
01:18:43,642 --> 01:18:46,011
Listen, your highness,
I'm telling you

1555
01:18:46,044 --> 01:18:48,013
what I told
the mayor last week.

1556
01:18:48,046 --> 01:18:51,617
By the end of the week,
I'll crack this case.

1557
01:18:51,650 --> 01:18:52,851
Right.

1558
01:18:52,885 --> 01:18:54,487
Another arab.

1559
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,022
Son of a bitch Farnsworth
was into everything,

1560
01:18:57,055 --> 01:19:00,559
and now he's vanished,
disappeared.

1561
01:19:00,593 --> 01:19:02,561
This is
the craziest nut

1562
01:19:02,595 --> 01:19:04,530
I've ever had
to deal with.

1563
01:19:04,563 --> 01:19:07,600
If he was alive,
he'd be here.

1564
01:19:07,633 --> 01:19:09,602
You're asking me
to believe

1565
01:19:09,635 --> 01:19:12,004
Leo Farnsworth
asked you to marry him?

1566
01:19:12,037 --> 01:19:14,607
Yes. He was going
to get a divorce.

1567
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,876
He said he'd call me,
but something happened.

1568
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:19,412
How do you know?

1569
01:19:19,445 --> 01:19:21,347
Because he didn't call me,

1570
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:23,782
and he would have
kept his word.

1571
01:19:23,816 --> 01:19:25,451
Hmm.

1572
01:19:25,484 --> 01:19:28,687
With less than 24 hours
before the big game,

1573
01:19:28,721 --> 01:19:30,689
the whereabouts
of Leo Farnsworth

1574
01:19:30,723 --> 01:19:32,391
remains a mystery.

1575
01:19:32,425 --> 01:19:34,627
Farnsworth said
his wife and Tony abbott

1576
01:19:34,660 --> 01:19:36,529
were trying to kill him,

1577
01:19:36,562 --> 01:19:39,532
and he told me how.
Let me talk to abbott.

1578
01:19:39,565 --> 01:19:41,400
I can make him crack.

1579
01:19:41,434 --> 01:19:43,001
Ok.

1580
01:19:43,035 --> 01:19:45,604
Take corkle to the
Farnsworth house.

1581
01:19:45,638 --> 01:19:46,805
The game.

1582
01:19:52,411 --> 01:19:54,747
And if you win this one...

1583
01:19:54,780 --> 01:19:57,750
You're going to be
champions of the world.

1584
01:19:57,783 --> 01:20:01,654
And they can take away
the money and the cheers.

1585
01:20:01,687 --> 01:20:03,422
They can...

1586
01:20:03,456 --> 01:20:06,625
Take away
the good looks,

1587
01:20:06,659 --> 01:20:09,862
but nobody will ever
take that away from you.

1588
01:20:15,668 --> 01:20:17,002
Let's go.

1589
01:20:23,576 --> 01:20:25,544
Let me get this straight.

1590
01:20:25,578 --> 01:20:28,547
You're saying you saw
no specific changes

1591
01:20:28,581 --> 01:20:29,948
in Mr. Farnsworth's
behavior?

1592
01:20:29,982 --> 01:20:32,551
No, sir. A bit
more talkative,

1593
01:20:32,585 --> 01:20:34,553
but other than
that, normal.

1594
01:20:34,587 --> 01:20:37,823
And that's your opinion,
too, Mr. Sisk?

1595
01:20:37,856 --> 01:20:39,425
Yes. I did notice

1596
01:20:39,458 --> 01:20:43,095
he seemed to take a
dislike to his hats,

1597
01:20:43,128 --> 01:20:45,097
but it
was never violent.

1598
01:20:45,130 --> 01:20:48,634
Why don't you ask me
whatever you want and--

1599
01:20:48,667 --> 01:20:50,569
Mr. Corkle, please.
Mr. Everett.

1600
01:20:50,603 --> 01:20:52,605
Oh. Uh, y-y-yes?

1601
01:20:52,638 --> 01:20:54,973
You had cocoa
with him every night.

1602
01:20:55,007 --> 01:20:55,974
Uh, yes.

1603
01:20:56,008 --> 01:20:57,976
What did you talk about?

1604
01:20:58,010 --> 01:21:00,546
Well, he'd say
something like,

1605
01:21:00,579 --> 01:21:04,683
uh, "this cocoa
is good, isn't it?"

1606
01:21:04,717 --> 01:21:08,587
And I'd say, uh,
"yes, it is."

1607
01:21:08,621 --> 01:21:12,124
And then he'd say
something like, uh,

1608
01:21:12,157 --> 01:21:14,993
"I wish the marshmallow
would last longer."

1609
01:21:15,027 --> 01:21:18,163
And I'd say,
uh, "so do I."

1610
01:21:18,196 --> 01:21:19,465
Uh...

1611
01:21:19,498 --> 01:21:22,801
Sometimes he talked
about cookies.

1612
01:21:22,835 --> 01:21:25,671
Thank you,
Mr. Everett.

1613
01:21:25,704 --> 01:21:28,106
Oh, did he ever mention
disliking his hats?

1614
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:31,577
What difference
does it make--

1615
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:34,713
I'm following a line
of questioning here.

1616
01:21:34,747 --> 01:21:39,618
Did he ever say anything
to you about his hats?

1617
01:21:39,652 --> 01:21:40,619
Never, sir.

1618
01:21:40,653 --> 01:21:42,888
Thank you,
Mr. Everett.

1619
01:21:54,567 --> 01:21:59,037
What did you discuss
the last time you saw him?

1620
01:21:59,071 --> 01:22:01,507
He was considering
buying Haiti.

1621
01:22:01,540 --> 01:22:03,609
Yes, sir.
The country?

1622
01:22:06,845 --> 01:22:09,214
Thank you, Mr. Abbott.

1623
01:22:09,247 --> 01:22:10,849
Nothing about hats?

1624
01:22:10,883 --> 01:22:12,651
No.

1625
01:22:12,685 --> 01:22:14,520
Thank you, Mr. Abbott.

1626
01:22:14,553 --> 01:22:15,921
Mrs. Farnsworth,

1627
01:22:15,954 --> 01:22:18,624
what was your relationship
with your husband?

1628
01:22:18,657 --> 01:22:21,694
Very, very close.
Very, very special.

1629
01:22:21,727 --> 01:22:25,631
Miss Logan claims
he was getting a divorce

1630
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:28,667
and that he asked her
to marry him.

1631
01:22:28,701 --> 01:22:30,035
I don't doubt that.

1632
01:22:30,068 --> 01:22:33,038
My husband loved me
very, very much,

1633
01:22:33,071 --> 01:22:34,773
but he was a man.

1634
01:22:34,807 --> 01:22:38,777
He would say or do anything
to make a conquest,

1635
01:22:38,811 --> 01:22:40,779
but, lieutenant, it never
touched our marriage.

1636
01:22:40,813 --> 01:22:42,915
That's what made it
so special.

1637
01:22:42,948 --> 01:22:44,950
They're trying
to pin it on Betty.

1638
01:22:44,983 --> 01:22:46,819
Miss Logan, I am sorry

1639
01:22:46,852 --> 01:22:49,187
if I've said anything
that's hurt you.

1640
01:22:49,221 --> 01:22:53,225
I don't know you well
enough for you to hurt me.

1641
01:22:53,258 --> 01:22:55,794
I hope you don't
doubt my word.

1642
01:22:55,828 --> 01:22:58,597
I don't. I'm absolutely
sure that you're lying.

1643
01:22:58,631 --> 01:23:00,599
I assume
if Mr. Farnsworth

1644
01:23:00,633 --> 01:23:03,001
told you anything
about disliking his hats,

1645
01:23:03,035 --> 01:23:04,603
you'd let us know.

1646
01:23:04,637 --> 01:23:07,039
You want to know
about his hats?

1647
01:23:07,072 --> 01:23:08,641
He didn't care,

1648
01:23:08,674 --> 01:23:11,043
but he wouldn't
wear socks with a suit!

1649
01:23:11,076 --> 01:23:13,045
Every time
he crossed his legs,

1650
01:23:13,078 --> 01:23:15,581
you could see
his ankles were bare!

1651
01:23:15,614 --> 01:23:18,551
And he thought hats
looked funny without socks!

1652
01:23:18,584 --> 01:23:21,687
But he never told you
he disliked them.

1653
01:23:21,720 --> 01:23:22,688
What?

1654
01:23:22,721 --> 01:23:23,889
His hats.

1655
01:23:23,922 --> 01:23:26,825
What kind of questions
are you asking?

1656
01:23:26,859 --> 01:23:28,226
All right. Sit down.

1657
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:30,228
Conway,
turn that thing on.

1658
01:23:30,262 --> 01:23:31,964
Let him watch the game.

1659
01:23:31,997 --> 01:23:33,966
Everything's going
to be all right.

1660
01:23:33,999 --> 01:23:36,702
We're getting
a clearer picture

1661
01:23:36,735 --> 01:23:38,103
of Mr. Farnsworth's
patterns.

1662
01:23:38,136 --> 01:23:40,105
There's a reason
for everything.

1663
01:23:40,138 --> 01:23:41,707
There's got to be.

1664
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:43,842
It's a demanding defense.

1665
01:23:43,876 --> 01:23:46,011
You don't need
to worry about her.

1666
01:23:46,044 --> 01:23:48,013
Tom Jarrett,
the rams' quarterback,

1667
01:23:48,046 --> 01:23:49,615
back to pass.

1668
01:23:49,648 --> 01:23:52,818
Looking, scrambling.
He's in trouble.

1669
01:23:52,851 --> 01:23:55,187
And he's hit hard!
Down he goes!

1670
01:24:01,694 --> 01:24:04,062
What you're telling me,
Mr. Abbott,

1671
01:24:04,096 --> 01:24:07,065
is that Mr. Farnsworth
never carried any money

1672
01:24:07,099 --> 01:24:09,702
or credit cards, right?

1673
01:24:09,735 --> 01:24:11,670
And no identification
papers, right?

1674
01:24:11,704 --> 01:24:13,071
Right, sir. Yes.

1675
01:24:13,105 --> 01:24:15,073
Then what
we have here...

1676
01:24:15,107 --> 01:24:17,676
The score, 24-24.
Overtime.

1677
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:21,213
The way he was hit,
Tom Jarrett is hurt.

1678
01:24:21,246 --> 01:24:26,218
We can see the ram players
are concerned

1679
01:24:26,251 --> 01:24:28,654
and they're calling
for the stretcher.

1680
01:24:28,687 --> 01:24:30,055
Jarrett has not moved.

1681
01:24:30,088 --> 01:24:32,057
It'll be a miracle,
frankly,

1682
01:24:32,090 --> 01:24:34,059
and I hope he's well.

1683
01:24:34,092 --> 01:24:35,661
He really got hit.

1684
01:24:35,694 --> 01:24:37,663
Now they order
Jerry Hodges

1685
01:24:37,696 --> 01:24:40,666
to start warming up
on the sidelines.

1686
01:24:40,699 --> 01:24:43,101
The Pittsburgh defense
has been brilliant.

1687
01:24:43,135 --> 01:24:45,137
They've stopped
the rams with--

1688
01:24:45,170 --> 01:24:47,773
the Haitian
ambassador's here.

1689
01:24:47,806 --> 01:24:50,208
Oh, yes. Yes,
thank you, sisk.

1690
01:24:50,242 --> 01:24:53,011
Give him a coke.
Tell him to wait.

1691
01:24:53,045 --> 01:24:55,213
Who do you
think you are?

1692
01:24:55,247 --> 01:24:58,350
You have a nerve to call
this an investigation!

1693
01:24:58,383 --> 01:24:59,618
Now!

1694
01:24:59,652 --> 01:25:02,621
How'd you do it
this time, huh?

1695
01:25:02,655 --> 01:25:05,658
Did you drug him
like you did before?

1696
01:25:05,691 --> 01:25:08,827
This one has seesawed
back and forth.

1697
01:25:08,861 --> 01:25:13,098
Lieutenant, I will not
be spoken to in this way

1698
01:25:13,131 --> 01:25:14,733
in my house.

1699
01:25:23,676 --> 01:25:26,044
Why did it have
to be Jarrett?

1700
01:25:26,078 --> 01:25:28,413
Because it's
his time, Joe.

1701
01:25:28,446 --> 01:25:30,015
It's his destiny.

1702
01:25:42,327 --> 01:25:44,029
Look at the pupils!

1703
01:25:44,062 --> 01:25:46,131
Bill, bill!
Get that ambulance!

1704
01:26:09,021 --> 01:26:11,990
And Jarrett's coming
back into the game.

1705
01:26:12,024 --> 01:26:13,125
Joe...

1706
01:26:15,894 --> 01:26:18,864
Oh, my god!
It's his jacket!

1707
01:26:20,298 --> 01:26:22,167
So it's you, Mr. Abbott!

1708
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:25,003
I should have known
I couldn't trust you.

1709
01:26:25,037 --> 01:26:26,304
Lieutenant,
here's your murderer!

1710
01:26:26,338 --> 01:26:27,973
She did it!

1711
01:26:28,006 --> 01:26:30,976
I'll sign a confession
that she did it!

1712
01:26:31,009 --> 01:26:33,378
She's been planning
it for years!

1713
01:26:33,411 --> 01:26:35,347
Corkle, where
are you going?

1714
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:36,949
I'm going
to the coliseum.

1715
01:26:36,982 --> 01:26:38,817
I'm conducting
an investigation here.

1716
01:26:38,851 --> 01:26:41,820
I'm going to the game.
Take this investigation

1717
01:26:41,854 --> 01:26:45,090
and shove it
up your ass!

1718
01:26:45,123 --> 01:26:48,994
3-23. Hut! Hut!

1719
01:26:59,905 --> 01:27:01,273
It's sudden death
overtime!

1720
01:27:01,306 --> 01:27:03,842
Jarrett's sending
this crowd into delirium!

1721
01:27:18,857 --> 01:27:21,126
The crowd watching Jarrett.
He was sacked hard.

1722
01:27:21,159 --> 01:27:23,028
He's getting up.
He's ok.

1723
01:27:38,043 --> 01:27:40,879
2-3...set!

1724
01:27:42,981 --> 01:27:46,351
2-85! 2-85!

1725
01:27:46,384 --> 01:27:48,821
Hut! Hut!

1726
01:27:56,094 --> 01:27:57,830
A remarkable comeback
by Jarrett.

1727
01:27:57,863 --> 01:28:00,933
Jarrett trying to get them
into field goal position.

1728
01:28:10,575 --> 01:28:12,210
Set!

1729
01:28:13,879 --> 01:28:14,947
2...

1730
01:28:53,018 --> 01:28:54,252
All right!

1731
01:28:54,286 --> 01:28:57,022
We're number one!
We're number one!

1732
01:28:57,055 --> 01:28:59,892
We're number one!
We're number one!

1733
01:28:59,925 --> 01:29:02,127
We're number one!
We're number one!

1734
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:05,530
We're number one!
We're number one!

1735
01:29:05,563 --> 01:29:07,265
We're number one!

1736
01:29:10,168 --> 01:29:11,836
We did it!

1737
01:29:15,107 --> 01:29:16,374
Joe!

1738
01:29:16,408 --> 01:29:17,642
Hi, Max.

1739
01:29:17,675 --> 01:29:20,545
I am right.
It is you, isn't it?

1740
01:29:20,578 --> 01:29:21,980
Yeah.

1741
01:29:22,014 --> 01:29:24,649
Ha ha ha ha!

1742
01:29:24,682 --> 01:29:27,352
I knew it!
I knew it!

1743
01:29:27,385 --> 01:29:29,354
I was watching the TV,

1744
01:29:29,387 --> 01:29:33,391
and I said,
"that's him! That's him!"

1745
01:29:33,425 --> 01:29:35,260
The rams are
super bowl champions!

1746
01:29:35,293 --> 01:29:37,462
Here's the star,
Tom Jarrett.

1747
01:29:37,495 --> 01:29:39,464
He led his team
to victory.

1748
01:29:39,497 --> 01:29:40,933
How do you feel?

1749
01:29:40,966 --> 01:29:42,167
Good.

1750
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:45,070
I mean, can you
describe your feelings?

1751
01:29:45,103 --> 01:29:46,071
World champions!

1752
01:29:46,104 --> 01:29:48,073
I, uh, I feel good.

1753
01:29:48,106 --> 01:29:49,107
Please, please.

1754
01:29:49,141 --> 01:29:51,176
I have
to go now, Joe.

1755
01:29:51,209 --> 01:29:52,277
It's time.

1756
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:54,679
I can't stay here
any longer.

1757
01:29:54,712 --> 01:29:56,281
What do you mean?

1758
01:29:56,314 --> 01:29:58,650
How does it feel
to be Tom Jarrett?

1759
01:29:58,683 --> 01:30:01,653
And when I've gone,
you won't remember me.

1760
01:30:01,686 --> 01:30:03,255
You'll be Thomas Jarrett

1761
01:30:03,288 --> 01:30:05,523
with no memory
of Joe Pendleton

1762
01:30:05,557 --> 01:30:09,261
or Leo Farnsworth or
anything that's happened.

1763
01:30:09,294 --> 01:30:11,263
This is
your destiny, Joe.

1764
01:30:11,296 --> 01:30:13,531
You're back on
your own road now.

1765
01:30:13,565 --> 01:30:16,101
What do you mean,
I won't remember?

1766
01:30:16,134 --> 01:30:18,703
Good-bye, Joe.

1767
01:30:18,736 --> 01:30:21,273
There's a lot
of confusion.

1768
01:30:21,306 --> 01:30:24,209
Wait. I got to talk
to you. Wait.

1769
01:30:24,242 --> 01:30:25,343
Good-bye.

1770
01:30:25,377 --> 01:30:26,644
Tom, congratulations.

1771
01:30:26,678 --> 01:30:28,981
Here he is--
coach of...

1772
01:30:29,014 --> 01:30:31,683
You ok, Tom?
You ok?

1773
01:30:31,716 --> 01:30:33,285
Here's Lamar Crawford,

1774
01:30:33,318 --> 01:30:36,688
the man who caught
one of those key passes.

1775
01:30:36,721 --> 01:30:39,457
I'm just happy
that we won.

1776
01:30:54,706 --> 01:30:58,276
In September, I told you
the beginning of this season!

1777
01:30:58,310 --> 01:30:59,411
Ha ha!

1778
01:30:59,444 --> 01:31:00,545
Hey, Benny!

1779
01:31:00,578 --> 01:31:03,281
Hey, Joe! Uh, Tom!

1780
01:31:03,315 --> 01:31:05,283
Hey, doc.
Did Tom leave?

1781
01:31:05,317 --> 01:31:08,286
He's putting
some ice on his eye.

1782
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:09,687
He'll be all right.

1783
01:31:09,721 --> 01:31:12,290
That's something about
Farnsworth, isn't it?

1784
01:31:12,324 --> 01:31:14,292
Poor son of a bitch.

1785
01:31:14,326 --> 01:31:15,994
Yeah, isn't it?

1786
01:31:31,409 --> 01:31:33,578
Hey. Corkle.

1787
01:31:33,611 --> 01:31:37,182
What are you doing,
closing up the joint?

1788
01:31:37,215 --> 01:31:40,185
I didn't know you
played that thing.

1789
01:31:40,218 --> 01:31:42,187
What are you
talking about?

1790
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:44,456
Hmm? Is that yours?

1791
01:31:44,489 --> 01:31:46,658
What are you
talking about?

1792
01:31:46,691 --> 01:31:48,260
What do you mean?

1793
01:31:48,293 --> 01:31:50,262
You know what I mean.

1794
01:31:50,295 --> 01:31:53,365
I mean, what are you
talking about, Joe?

1795
01:31:58,136 --> 01:31:59,604
Am I missing
something?

1796
01:32:01,539 --> 01:32:02,674
Come on.

1797
01:32:02,707 --> 01:32:05,677
What are you trying
to do to me, huh?

1798
01:32:05,710 --> 01:32:09,281
Hey, I'm the guy that
got hit in the head.

1799
01:32:09,314 --> 01:32:11,549
You sure you're
all right, corkle?

1800
01:32:11,583 --> 01:32:13,085
Huh? Huh?

1801
01:32:13,118 --> 01:32:16,721
Hey, play something
for me on this thing, huh?

1802
01:32:18,356 --> 01:32:21,326
That's the way it is
with champagne, huh?

1803
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:23,328
You just keep
swallowing it

1804
01:32:23,361 --> 01:32:25,730
'cause it doesn't
taste like anything,

1805
01:32:25,763 --> 01:32:29,033
and all of a sudden,
you're drunk.

1806
01:32:37,275 --> 01:32:39,244
You going
to the party, corkle?

1807
01:32:39,277 --> 01:32:41,346
I'll give you a ride.

1808
01:32:49,287 --> 01:32:51,156
Hey, you--

1809
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:54,559
a little fresh air
wouldn't hurt.

1810
01:32:57,362 --> 01:33:00,332
Hey, look.
Just do me one favor.

1811
01:33:00,365 --> 01:33:01,799
Uh, look at me.

1812
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:06,238
Just--just...
Just look at me.

1813
01:33:06,271 --> 01:33:07,439
What?

1814
01:33:08,740 --> 01:33:09,841
What?

1815
01:33:18,216 --> 01:33:19,717
Joe.

1816
01:33:26,158 --> 01:33:28,493
Joe.

1817
01:33:30,395 --> 01:33:33,231
Uh...

1818
01:33:33,265 --> 01:33:37,101
You want to tell me why
you're calling me Joe?

1819
01:33:41,373 --> 01:33:44,442
I guess it has
something to do with...

1820
01:33:44,476 --> 01:33:45,810
Joe Pendleton.

1821
01:33:51,416 --> 01:33:53,385
Hey, uh...

1822
01:33:53,418 --> 01:33:56,554
I'm sorry.
I didn't think, corkle.

1823
01:34:01,826 --> 01:34:04,796
You sure you
don't want a ride?

1824
01:34:04,829 --> 01:34:06,398
No, I'll just, uh...

1825
01:34:06,431 --> 01:34:09,434
I'm going to sit
here for a minute.

1826
01:34:09,467 --> 01:34:10,835
Ok.

1827
01:34:10,868 --> 01:34:14,172
Hey, son, you--

1828
01:34:14,206 --> 01:34:15,707
you played
a hell of a game.

1829
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:17,809
Oh, thanks, corkle.

1830
01:34:17,842 --> 01:34:19,511
You all right?

1831
01:34:19,544 --> 01:34:21,546
Yeah.

1832
01:34:21,579 --> 01:34:22,814
Yeah.

1833
01:34:22,847 --> 01:34:24,416
Ok.

1834
01:34:55,913 --> 01:34:57,482
Oh, excuse me.

1835
01:34:57,515 --> 01:34:59,884
Where might I
find Max corkle?

1836
01:34:59,917 --> 01:35:01,886
I believe
he's here somewhere.

1837
01:35:01,919 --> 01:35:04,489
Yeah. He's in
the locker room.

1838
01:35:04,522 --> 01:35:07,425
Go back up there
the way you came

1839
01:35:07,459 --> 01:35:10,428
or take a right
and then a left.

1840
01:35:10,462 --> 01:35:12,830
It's the second door
on the right.

1841
01:35:12,864 --> 01:35:15,300
I see. Thank you.

1842
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:16,434
Thank you.

1843
01:35:23,475 --> 01:35:24,842
He's not
expecting me.

1844
01:35:24,876 --> 01:35:27,745
Is it ok if
I just walk in?

1845
01:35:27,779 --> 01:35:31,215
Sure. He's the only guy
in there, uh...

1846
01:35:36,354 --> 01:35:37,722
Have we met?

1847
01:35:37,755 --> 01:35:41,359
No. I don't think so.

1848
01:35:41,393 --> 01:35:43,828
No, I guess
we haven't.

1849
01:35:43,861 --> 01:35:46,331
I'm sorry, uh...

1850
01:35:46,364 --> 01:35:49,033
What did you think
of the game?

1851
01:35:49,066 --> 01:35:51,336
I--i didn't see it.

1852
01:35:53,605 --> 01:35:55,373
Does your eye hurt?

1853
01:35:55,407 --> 01:35:56,774
No, no, I...

1854
01:35:56,808 --> 01:35:58,976
Listen, my name's
Tom Jarrett.

1855
01:35:59,010 --> 01:36:01,045
Hello. I'm Betty Logan.

1856
01:36:01,078 --> 01:36:03,781
Yeah. Well, it's
nice to meet you.

1857
01:36:03,815 --> 01:36:06,451
You must play
for the rams.

1858
01:36:06,484 --> 01:36:09,587
You're interested
in football?

1859
01:36:09,621 --> 01:36:12,757
A friend of mine was.

1860
01:36:12,790 --> 01:36:13,891
Was?

1861
01:36:13,925 --> 01:36:15,993
Leo Farnsworth.

1862
01:36:17,629 --> 01:36:20,598
I'm sorry. Was
he a close friend?

1863
01:36:20,632 --> 01:36:23,568
Yes, he was
very close.

1864
01:36:24,836 --> 01:36:27,405
Oh, that's too bad.
I'm sorry.

1865
01:36:27,439 --> 01:36:30,542
Have you put
some ice on that?

1866
01:36:32,744 --> 01:36:33,811
What's that?

1867
01:36:33,845 --> 01:36:36,414
They're just
closing up the place.

1868
01:36:36,448 --> 01:36:38,516
Here, give me your hand.

1869
01:36:40,685 --> 01:36:43,888
It's all right. There's
nothing to be afraid of.

1870
01:36:47,725 --> 01:36:50,828
Uh...you can--you--

1871
01:36:50,862 --> 01:36:52,397
what did you say?

1872
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:54,466
What?

1873
01:36:55,767 --> 01:36:57,735
Just then,
when you said--

1874
01:36:57,769 --> 01:37:00,004
"there's nothing
to be afraid of,"

1875
01:37:00,037 --> 01:37:02,006
your voice sounded
so familiar.

1876
01:37:02,039 --> 01:37:03,375
Yeah?

1877
01:37:04,442 --> 01:37:05,810
Well, like I said,

1878
01:37:05,843 --> 01:37:07,979
I thought
I knew you, too.

1879
01:37:09,781 --> 01:37:12,884
People are always thinking
they knew somebody before.

1880
01:37:12,917 --> 01:37:15,753
Yes, they are.

1881
01:37:17,722 --> 01:37:21,092
Uh, I was going to
meet a bunch of people.

1882
01:37:21,125 --> 01:37:24,095
We're having a party,
and I'm a little late.

1883
01:37:24,128 --> 01:37:26,097
Oh, I'm sorry.

1884
01:37:26,130 --> 01:37:28,099
Oh, no, no, no, uh...

1885
01:37:28,132 --> 01:37:30,101
I mean, all of a sudden,

1886
01:37:30,134 --> 01:37:33,838
I don't feel like going
to a big party, and--

1887
01:37:33,871 --> 01:37:36,641
and, uh,
I thought maybe if--

1888
01:37:36,674 --> 01:37:38,476
I mean...

1889
01:37:38,510 --> 01:37:42,046
You want to have
a cup of coffee?

1890
01:37:49,153 --> 01:37:51,589
Well, I guess not.

1891
01:37:55,993 --> 01:37:57,995
You're the quarterback.

1892
01:37:59,797 --> 01:38:01,165
Yeah.

1893
01:38:01,198 --> 01:38:02,967
How'd you know that?

1894
01:38:06,504 --> 01:38:10,575
Yes, I'd love to have
a cup of coffee with you.
