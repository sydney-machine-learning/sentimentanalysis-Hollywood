Dan?

00:04:04,884 --> 00:04:07,111
Secretary would like a word,
wanna follow me?

30
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:15,750
Well, y-you can say what you
want to the President--

31
00:04:16,116 --> 00:04:17,945
I've read every one of
Ellsberg's reports,

32
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,820
and I'm telling you,
it's just not the case.

33
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:22,843
Dan, you know Mr. Komer.

34
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:25,420
He's been discussing the
war with the President

35
00:04:25,483 --> 00:04:27,217
and, well, his sense is
that we've made real progress

36
00:04:27,272 --> 00:04:29,397
over the past year, but I've
been doing my own review

37
00:04:29,422 --> 00:04:31,523
and it seems to me that
things have gotten worse.

38
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:32,895
But neither of us have
been in the field--

39
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,833
you have--you're
the one who knows

40
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:35,075
so, what do you say?

41
00:04:36,294 --> 00:04:37,821
Are things better or worse?

42
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:42,587
Well, Mr. Secretary, what
I'm most impressed by

43
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:44,423
is how much things
are the same.

44
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:46,298
See, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

45
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:50,515
We put another 100,000
troops in the field,

46
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,603
things are no better?

47
00:04:51,628 --> 00:04:54,212
To me, that seems like
things are actually worse.

48
00:04:56,602 --> 00:04:57,602
Thank you, Dan.

49
00:05:01,579 --> 00:05:02,743
Mr. Secretary!

50
00:05:03,556 --> 00:05:04,657
Mr. Secretary, sir!

51
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:07,612
How was your trip, sir?

52
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:09,347
Sir?

53
00:05:09,495 --> 00:05:11,604
Good afternoon, gentlemen,
I don't have any uh,

54
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:13,698
prepared remarks but I'd be very
happy to take your questions

55
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:15,284
one at a time-- Jim?

56
00:05:15,338 --> 00:05:18,252
Mr. Secretary, I'm wondering
if the trip left you optimistic

57
00:05:18,324 --> 00:05:20,470
or pessimistic about our
prospects in this war

58
00:05:20,495 --> 00:05:21,848
 and our ability to win it?

59
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:23,747
Well, you asked whether I was
optimistic or pessimistic.

60
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:26,614
Today, I can tell you that military
progress over the past 12 months

61
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,997
has exceeded our expectations.

62
00:05:28,022 --> 00:05:30,558
We're very encouraged by what
we're seeing in Vietnam.

63
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,344
In every respect,
we're making progress.

64
00:05:32,938 --> 00:05:36,146
I'm especially pleased to have
Bob Komer along for the trip--

65
00:05:36,193 --> 00:05:37,935
so he can see for himself
that we've been showing

66
00:05:38,013 --> 00:05:40,224
great improvement in every
dimension of the war effort.

67
00:05:44,207 --> 00:05:45,176
Derrick.

68
00:06:53,758 --> 00:06:55,430
-Goodnight, Dan.
-Goodnight, Dan.

69
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:56,812
Night, guys.

70
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,430
You okay, Dan?

71
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:08,985
Yeah, yeah, I thought I'd, uh...
forgot something. I didn't.

72
00:07:16,915 --> 00:07:18,626
Next left, on Melrose.

73
00:08:26,431 --> 00:08:27,604
<i>We have committed ourselves</i>

74
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:30,627
<i>to the cause of a just
and peaceful world order</i>

75
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:32,213
<i>through the United Nations.</i>

76
00:08:32,462 --> 00:08:34,571
May 3rd, 1950.

77
00:08:34,704 --> 00:08:37,461
President Truman approved
ten million dollars in military aid

78
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:38,657
to Indochina.

79
00:08:45,356 --> 00:08:47,950
<i>America's leadership
and prestige depend</i>

80
00:08:47,992 --> 00:08:50,210
<i>on how we use our power</i>

81
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:52,625
<i>in the interest of world peace.</i>

82
00:08:52,673 --> 00:08:54,376
I feel concerned
about paragraph six

83
00:08:54,415 --> 00:08:57,844
which gives authority to control
general elections in Vietnam.

84
00:09:00,308 --> 00:09:02,457
<i>The United States,
as the world knows,</i>

85
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,347
<i>will never start a war.</i>

86
00:09:05,773 --> 00:09:07,569
May 11th, 1961.

87
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:09,540
President Kennedy orders
a full examination

88
00:09:09,587 --> 00:09:11,618
by the Defense Department
of a possible commitment

89
00:09:11,643 --> 00:09:13,298
of U.S. forces to Vietnam.

90
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:21,097
<i>We are not about to send
American boys</i>

91
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,097
<i>nine or ten thousand
miles away from home</i>

92
00:09:24,395 --> 00:09:28,395
<i>to do what Asian boys ought
to be doing for themselves.</i>

93
00:09:28,513 --> 00:09:30,919
President Johnson chose to
reaffirm the Kennedy policy's

94
00:09:30,944 --> 00:09:34,325
military operation to be initiated
under close political control.

95
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:23,232
Can we just do the-
can we do the numbers one-

96
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:24,889
just one more time?

97
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:27,366
The company's selling
how many shares?

98
00:10:27,485 --> 00:10:29,876
1.35 million shares.

99
00:10:30,314 --> 00:10:31,478
And the price range is?

100
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:35,470
Uh, between-between $24.50 and
twenty-f--seven dollars per share.

101
00:10:35,564 --> 00:10:37,071
Not exactly a huge difference.

102
00:10:37,407 --> 00:10:41,117
For them but, you know, the bankers
always do fiddle with the prices--

103
00:10:41,196 --> 00:10:45,286
but for us, that's over three
million dollars and that

104
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,501
represents over five years
salary for 25 good reporters.

105
00:10:49,627 --> 00:10:51,985
Good. But why spend
in the newsroom?

106
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:55,431
You're far less profitable than
Gannett or Knight and Ridder.

107
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,928
Gannett and Knight and Ridder own
monopoly papers in smaller cities

108
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:02,586
and-and our readers are-are
leaders, you know?

109
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:04,258
they're-they're educated,
they demand more.

110
00:11:04,305 --> 00:11:08,407
That's why we invest in
really good reporters.

111
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:10,265
-And so...
-B-Because

112
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,087
quality and-and profitability
do go hand in hand.

113
00:11:15,712 --> 00:11:17,556
See? You know all this already.

114
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:18,633
Oh, God!

115
00:11:18,829 --> 00:11:20,579
I don't know if I do.

116
00:11:20,686 --> 00:11:21,991
-I should get to breakfast.
-Yeah.

117
00:11:22,016 --> 00:11:23,600
We don't want Paul
or Arthur too antsy at this

118
00:11:23,678 --> 00:11:24,756
-No.
-at the meeting.

119
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:25,803
Good luck.

120
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,389
-And thank you, Fritz.
-Mm-hmm.

121
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,310
-See you downtown.
-I'll see you.

122
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:33,044
You think this is really necessary?

123
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:34,958
Oh, God, yes, darling.

124
00:11:34,983 --> 00:11:37,841
You should hear how they
talk at these meetings.

125
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,855
It's as if it's in a foreign language.

126
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,714
No, I meant taking
the company public.

127
00:11:47,057 --> 00:11:50,229
It seems we are...cash poor.

128
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:52,033
You know, barely solvent.

129
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:53,336
That's the newspaper business.

130
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:55,086
That's our newspaper business.

131
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:57,359
And we need the public
offering to stay in business--

132
00:11:57,438 --> 00:11:58,742
and to continue to grow.

133
00:11:59,203 --> 00:12:00,492
That's what Fritz says.

134
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:04,188
And he also says that the family
can maintain control if we...

135
00:12:05,787 --> 00:12:08,256
Anyway, I'm just not sure your
grandfather would've wanted us

136
00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:09,928
to give up any control at all.

137
00:12:12,871 --> 00:12:13,785
Hello?

138
00:12:14,457 --> 00:12:16,527
<i>-Mrs. Graham?</i>
-Yes, this is she.

139
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:18,566
<i>Please hold for
the Chief of Staff.</i>

140
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:21,449
Who is it?

141
00:12:22,449 --> 00:12:23,370
Haldeman.

142
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,853
<i>-Mrs. Graham, Bob Haldeman.</i>
-Yes, hello.

143
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:29,509
<i>We've got a bit of
an issue over here.</i>

144
00:12:29,946 --> 00:12:30,947
Oh?

145
00:12:43,427 --> 00:12:44,403
Jesus.

146
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:45,823
Oh.

147
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:47,136
I'm so sorry.

148
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:49,594
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.
-Well, good morning.

149
00:12:49,703 --> 00:12:53,663
I'm so late. I had to get all this...
stuff together and uh...

150
00:12:54,241 --> 00:12:56,655
then I had an unexpected call.

151
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:58,772
Well, what is with the suitcase?

152
00:12:59,686 --> 00:13:01,397
Ben, I told you...

153
00:13:02,052 --> 00:13:03,841
this is the day, we're
meeting with the bankers

154
00:13:03,905 --> 00:13:05,826
-Oh, yes, yes, right, right.
-today, you know this.

155
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,954
-Well, I bet you every dollar
-Thank you.

156
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:10,220
in my wallet that you are the
only person in that boardroom

157
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:12,423
who's read through
all their nonsense.

158
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:14,643
I'm probably the only
one who needs to.

159
00:13:14,737 --> 00:13:17,340
What do you think
of Neil Sheehan?

160
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:21,942
Oh, gosh, his coverage of Vietnam
is just absolutely marvelous. Why?

161
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:24,934
You thinking of trying to
steal him from The Times?

162
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:26,192
I'm not sure we can afford him.

163
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,520
He, uh, he hasn't had a
piece in three months.

164
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:30,435
Oh?

165
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:32,521
You think he's onto something?

166
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:35,420
Well, I saw Abe at a
dinner party last week

167
00:13:35,445 --> 00:13:38,045
and he was looking
mighty, mighty smug.

168
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:40,201
Isn't he always?

169
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:43,453
-So who was it?
-Who was what?

170
00:13:43,601 --> 00:13:45,172
Your unexpected call.

171
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:46,485
Oh.

172
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:48,445
I buried the lead.

173
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,235
The White House.

174
00:13:50,821 --> 00:13:52,727
-Haldeman rang.
-Yeah?

175
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,049
It seems the President
has decided

176
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:57,460
not to provide Judith
with credentials

177
00:13:57,485 --> 00:13:58,944
to cover the Nixon wedding.

178
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,921
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-Yeah.

179
00:14:00,999 --> 00:14:03,218
They said we could
send another reporter.

180
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,382
Oh, yeah?

181
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:06,747
-Can't believe that.
-I know.

182
00:14:06,881 --> 00:14:08,360
-I know, but don't...
-Jesus.

183
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,134
But what?

184
00:14:09,159 --> 00:14:11,208
I'm not sure I entirely
blame the President

185
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,759
-on this one, Dan.
-No?

186
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:15,318
Would you want Judith to cover
your daughter's wedding?

187
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:16,935
Well, my daughter's
only ten years old.

188
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:20,301
I think she burned her bridges when
she crashed Julie's reception.

189
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:22,387
-They're being punitive.
-Her pen is so sharp.

190
00:14:22,412 --> 00:14:23,662
-Of course it's punitive.
-This is punitive.

191
00:14:23,717 --> 00:14:24,857
Of course it's punitive.

192
00:14:26,118 --> 00:14:30,063
She compared Tricia Nixon
to a vanilla ice cream cone.

193
00:14:30,118 --> 00:14:32,064
-She did, yeah.
-Yeah.

194
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,253
I mean, why would
her father want Judy

195
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:35,769
to cover his
daughter's wedding?

196
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:38,167
-Oh, come on.
-I just...

197
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:42,141
Are you sure we're striking
the right tone here, Dan?

198
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,618
Oh, we're gonna do this again?

199
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:46,645
No, the new Style
section, sometimes the

200
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:48,660
-stiletto party coverage
-I'm handling it.

201
00:14:48,685 --> 00:14:50,050
-can be a little mean.
-I'm handling it.

202
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:51,589
-I'm looking for a new editor.
-Yes.

203
00:14:51,614 --> 00:14:54,673
Are you? Because I know I've
talked to you about this before.

204
00:14:54,848 --> 00:14:57,926
You are losing female readership,
you know, and I think

205
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,277
I think you might wanna
focus more on what women--

206
00:15:01,308 --> 00:15:03,535
Katharine, keep your
finger out of my eye.

207
00:15:11,314 --> 00:15:12,462
You...

208
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:17,217
These breakfasts were
your idea, you know.

209
00:15:17,256 --> 00:15:19,225
Ah, yes, yes, and you
are the publisher

210
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:21,842
and you are my boss and I uh...

211
00:15:21,878 --> 00:15:25,167
I value the input but I-I-I heard
you the first three times.

212
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,706
You know, I just think that
there might be another way

213
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:30,186
that we could cool it
with the White House,

214
00:15:30,226 --> 00:15:33,507
maybe we could just send
somebody else, you know?

215
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:34,842
-Nope, nope, nope.
-Because it is

216
00:15:34,905 --> 00:15:36,327
I'm not gonna send
another reporter.

217
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:39,255
not hard news, Ben,
it's just a wedding.

218
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:41,179
It's not just a wedding, it's...

219
00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:43,541
It's the wedding of the daughter of
the President of the United States.

220
00:15:43,566 --> 00:15:45,509
-Let that girl have her day.
-We can't have them--

221
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,181
an administration dictating
to us our coverage

222
00:15:48,206 --> 00:15:49,483
just because they don't like

223
00:15:49,508 --> 00:15:51,789
what we print about
them in our newspaper.

224
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:59,465
I wonder if Abe cares
so passionately about

225
00:15:59,565 --> 00:16:01,401
who covers the wedding
for his paper.

226
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:02,386
Well, I don't give a rat's ass

227
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:04,722
what Abe or anybody at the
New York Times cares about.

228
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,261
Not true, I give one rat's ass.

229
00:16:06,611 --> 00:16:09,361
One retromingent rat's ass.

230
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:40,901
Tell 'em it's from Sheehan.

231
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:42,428
Don't walk.

232
00:17:09,943 --> 00:17:11,060
It's from Sheehan.

233
00:17:18,084 --> 00:17:20,076
Abe, here it is.

234
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:40,513
Okay, Roder's got Nixon
working on a second term.

235
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:44,106
Osles has something on G.I.s
buying heroin in Saigon, but

236
00:17:44,223 --> 00:17:47,591
Ryder's got a rocket on the
FBI list of potential subversives.

237
00:17:47,654 --> 00:17:50,904
Ah, save it for the afternoon,
I need Chal and Judith.

238
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:52,123
Judith!

239
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,472
Is that real--a subversives list?

240
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,956
Oh, yeah, Hoover at
Justice keep a copy.

241
00:17:57,003 --> 00:17:58,315
Thousands of names.

242
00:17:58,348 --> 00:17:59,939
Geyelin heard the White House
is shutting Judith out.

243
00:17:59,964 --> 00:18:00,934
Yeah, I'm workin' on that.

244
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:02,190
We think editorial
should run something.

245
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,176
I just heard somebody say
they're workin' on that.

246
00:18:04,201 --> 00:18:05,654
Well, if the White House is
gonna take a stance like that,

247
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,748
don't you think we
should plant a flag?

248
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:14,550
Did you see Sheehan at the
Kissinger press conference?

249
00:18:14,683 --> 00:18:15,433
No.

250
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:17,425
What about the Al Haig thing?

251
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:19,269
No, Times sent the new kid.

252
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,359
New kid.

253
00:18:21,804 --> 00:18:23,476
You think Sheehan's
onto something.

254
00:18:24,023 --> 00:18:24,968
Yeah.

255
00:18:25,695 --> 00:18:28,015
Well, Neil has been
known to disappear,

256
00:18:28,088 --> 00:18:30,362
No, no, no, I'm telling you
he has something.

257
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:32,572
You want me to do
a little digging?

258
00:18:33,091 --> 00:18:35,489
No, that's below your pay grade.

259
00:18:35,778 --> 00:18:36,840
Intern!

260
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,576
You uh, workin' on anything
important, chief?

261
00:18:40,654 --> 00:18:42,162
Uh, no, Mr. Bradlee.

262
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:46,247
Well, everything we do is
important...at The Post.

263
00:18:46,364 --> 00:18:48,145
Here's $40, I want you
to take the first train

264
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,044
up to New York
and go to the--

265
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:53,043
go to The Times building on 43rd-
don't tell 'em who you work for

266
00:18:53,106 --> 00:18:55,903
but find a reporter
by the name of Sheehan.

267
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:57,294
Uh, Neil Sheehan?

268
00:18:57,458 --> 00:19:01,927
Yeah, yeah, find out what
Neil Sheehan is workin' on.

269
00:19:02,911 --> 00:19:04,161
Is that legal?

270
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:07,638
Well, what is it you think we
do here for a living, kid?

271
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:10,457
-Get a receipt for the tickets.
-Yeah.

272
00:19:26,887 --> 00:19:29,192
-Morning, Mrs. Graham.
-Morning.

273
00:19:33,354 --> 00:19:35,096
Hello, morning everybody.

274
00:19:35,362 --> 00:19:36,407
-Morning, nice to see you.
-Mrs. Graham.

275
00:19:36,432 --> 00:19:37,823
-Morning.
-Morning, Arthur.

276
00:19:39,371 --> 00:19:40,246
Hello.

277
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,045
So, everyone's here.

278
00:19:45,326 --> 00:19:47,459
-How are you--my Galahad?
-Morning.

279
00:19:48,263 --> 00:19:49,185
Thank you.

280
00:20:00,432 --> 00:20:03,917
And I used to be the only one
who brought his homework to class.

281
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:08,363
I think we're all here,
should we get started?

282
00:20:09,045 --> 00:20:11,208
Didn't you crash the
wedding of Nixon's

283
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:13,123
other daughter to get a story?

284
00:20:13,148 --> 00:20:15,795
Well, I did get a story, but
I didn't crash Julie's wedding.

285
00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:17,529
No, no, just the
reception afterwards.

286
00:20:17,577 --> 00:20:18,764
There is a distinction.

287
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:20,921
Not to the father of the bride,
he's paying for play.

288
00:20:21,032 --> 00:20:23,273
I think the American people
are paying for play.

289
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:24,727
Great, let's do
a story about that.

290
00:20:24,752 --> 00:20:26,728
-Yeah, let's--
-Judith should crash again.

291
00:20:26,805 --> 00:20:28,594
I didn't crash Julie's wedding.

292
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:29,766
What would you call it, Judith?

293
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:31,797
Well, I would call it
depth reportage.

294
00:20:31,822 --> 00:20:33,114
All right, come on,
come on, everybody.

295
00:20:33,139 --> 00:20:35,880
How are we gonna cover
this Nixon-Cox wedding?

296
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:42,459
Uh, who else is gonna be there?

297
00:20:42,498 --> 00:20:44,170
-Oh, here.
-Judith's got the guest list.

298
00:20:44,195 --> 00:20:46,154
No, I mean the other press?

299
00:20:46,193 --> 00:20:48,879
Well, The Times, The Sun, The Globe,
all the international papers.

300
00:20:48,904 --> 00:20:49,873
All right.

301
00:20:50,662 --> 00:20:53,146
So, we-we-we call them,

302
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:55,185
we call all of them and uh,

303
00:20:55,427 --> 00:20:58,036
we say Nixon has shut us out

304
00:20:58,061 --> 00:21:00,263
and then we ask them
for their notes.

305
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:03,339
Ben, there's no way in hell
anyone's gonna give me a fill.

306
00:21:03,364 --> 00:21:06,160
No, they'll...i-it'll be an
act of solidarity--

307
00:21:06,185 --> 00:21:08,363
they'll be defending
the first amendment.

308
00:21:08,772 --> 00:21:12,310
We'll tell them that the only way
to protect the right to publish

309
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,679
is to publish.

310
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:23,920
I don't understand, you said
we'd set the price at $27.

311
00:21:23,959 --> 00:21:25,475
No, we said there was a range.

312
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,929
and the demand on the
road show us soft.

313
00:21:28,214 --> 00:21:31,503
Why not set it at $26?
Or 25 even?

314
00:21:31,571 --> 00:21:33,094
Well, Paul, we feel that
setting the price at

315
00:21:33,196 --> 00:21:35,423
24.50 would be
more prudent.

316
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:36,461
It's just a couple of bucks.

317
00:21:36,486 --> 00:21:41,462
It's not just a couple of bucks,
it's 1.35 million shares...

318
00:21:41,855 --> 00:21:43,535
so, it is...

319
00:21:44,967 --> 00:21:46,490
Th-Three million.

320
00:21:47,028 --> 00:21:51,121
Over three million dollars
less--that's a lot to a newspaper.

321
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:53,348
I mean, how many
reporters is that?

322
00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:55,885
-It's-It's twenty-five--
-Let's not get bogged down...

323
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:58,783
-It has to be quite a few.
-At least a dozen. Fritz?

324
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:02,062
It's uh, twenty-five reporters--

325
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,906
Twenty-five reporters?

326
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:05,414
Twenty-five reporters.

327
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,430
Gentlemen, we know it's not ideal,

328
00:22:07,455 --> 00:22:11,687
but a few of our investors balked
at the nature of the company.

329
00:22:11,996 --> 00:22:13,301
They don't like newspapers?

330
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,434
They like Gannett
and Knight and Ridder

331
00:22:15,504 --> 00:22:17,113
but...frankly they're
concerned about

332
00:22:17,184 --> 00:22:19,504
your ability to turn
a serious profit.

333
00:22:33,664 --> 00:22:34,983
Gannett and Knight and Ridder

334
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:37,007
own monopoly papers
in smaller markets

335
00:22:37,054 --> 00:22:38,773
-that's why they're more profitable.
-Mmm.

336
00:22:39,273 --> 00:22:42,320
The whole point of the
offering is to grow--

337
00:22:42,437 --> 00:22:44,444
while investing in the
quality of the paper.

338
00:22:44,507 --> 00:22:47,648
Kay and I have talked
a great deal about this.

339
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:50,874
And we believe that
improving quality

340
00:22:50,922 --> 00:22:54,195
will naturally lead
to greater profitability.

341
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:59,192
-Unfortunate.
-More than unfortunate.

342
00:22:59,596 --> 00:23:02,893
Does this happen all the time?
Bankers lowering the price

343
00:23:02,971 --> 00:23:06,260
for their institutional investors?
Fritz, isn't this what we discussed?

344
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:08,533
I think the family should
consider giving up some control--

345
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,831
maybe another board seat.

346
00:23:09,864 --> 00:23:10,917
Absolutely not.

347
00:23:10,964 --> 00:23:13,550
This isn't a surprise, Fritz--
ever since Phil's accident.

348
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:14,402
Arthur.

349
00:23:14,478 --> 00:23:17,142
No offense, Kay,
it's unfortunate but...

350
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:20,142
The buyers are obviously skittish
about having a woman in charge

351
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:22,432
and it's-it's not like
it's an easy sell--

352
00:23:22,457 --> 00:23:25,265
it's a local paper with modest
margins, modest ambitions.

353
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,156
I think Mr. Bradlee would take
issue with that characterization.

354
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:29,649
Sure, she pads his budget.

355
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:33,054
Amelia, call my office, tell them I'm
gonna miss my lunch at Occidental.

356
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,046
Of course, Mr. Parsons.

357
00:23:34,071 --> 00:23:35,672
Another dozen
reporters for what?

358
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:37,211
To nip at the heels of The Times?

359
00:23:37,236 --> 00:23:40,555
So we can pretend like we're even
remotely in the same league?

360
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,854
Make it a 5:00 drink at
The Jefferson.

361
00:23:42,953 --> 00:23:45,009
Arthur, Kay was right,
Lazard is just trying to

362
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,148
-Come on.
-cut a better deal by squeezing us.

363
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,219
-Why do you think that is?
-Because they're bankers

364
00:23:49,244 --> 00:23:51,484
which is why they
want more control.

365
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:53,851
They want assurances that she's
not gonna squander it all.

366
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:54,912
I mean, come on.

367
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:57,445
Fritz, Kay throws a great party,

368
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,031
but her father gave the
paper to her husband.

369
00:24:00,484 --> 00:24:03,656
The only reason she's running
things is because he-because...

370
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:05,351
Phil died.

371
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:09,359
Don't get me wrong, I think
she is a lovely woman.

372
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:13,408
But she got rid of Al Friendly
and brought in a pirate

373
00:24:13,564 --> 00:24:15,595
who does nothing but
bleed our margins.

374
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:18,377
I mean, you can't be surprised
that the buyers are concerned

375
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:21,830
that she doesn't have the resolve
to turn a serious profit.

376
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,658
Kay, it's your decision.

377
00:24:29,377 --> 00:24:30,775
But in my opinion,

378
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,580
if you want this to be more
than a little family paper,

379
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:36,798
it has to be more than
a little family business.

380
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,683
Thank you, Arthur,
for your frankness.

381
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,222
All right.

382
00:24:46,927 --> 00:24:49,466
-We're set?
-All set, Mr. Parsons.

383
00:24:52,402 --> 00:24:53,363
Accident.

384
00:24:55,723 --> 00:24:56,574
I...

385
00:24:57,183 --> 00:24:58,684
It wasn't an accident.

386
00:25:00,035 --> 00:25:02,332
Phil's suicide--I don't know why

387
00:25:02,817 --> 00:25:05,395
people insist on calling
it an accident.

388
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,129
Is it to make them feel better?

389
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:11,988
Or do they think they're...

390
00:25:12,738 --> 00:25:15,535
being kind? I don't know.
I don't know.

391
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:18,444
So, do you think I should

392
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:20,686
give up more seats on the board?

393
00:25:21,543 --> 00:25:22,926
Of course not.

394
00:25:24,598 --> 00:25:26,285
We're going to be fine.

395
00:25:26,832 --> 00:25:27,644
Hmm.

396
00:25:28,372 --> 00:25:30,051
This passage...

397
00:25:30,473 --> 00:25:34,411
in the prospectus that I--
I read it earlier today.

398
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:38,622
The uh, oh, yes...

399
00:25:40,356 --> 00:25:42,801
"In the unlikely
instance of disaster

400
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,277
"or catastrophic event
in the week

401
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:47,516
"following the initial
public offering,

402
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:51,646
"Lazard Frères & Co. retains
full right to cancel the issue."

403
00:25:51,731 --> 00:25:53,146
It's boiler plate, Kay.

404
00:25:53,248 --> 00:25:55,561
It's standard
contractual language.

405
00:25:56,498 --> 00:26:00,600
Uh...but, so, that bankers
could pull out?

406
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:03,242
Only if there's a true disaster.

407
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,870
Ben gets hit by a truck...

408
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,495
the world runs out
of newspaper ink...

409
00:26:10,734 --> 00:26:14,001
the...truck goes around the
block and hits Ben again...

410
00:26:15,586 --> 00:26:16,937
You think one of
those is possible.

411
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:19,135
I don't but, you know.

412
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,408
The Nixon White House is
nothing if not vindictive.

413
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:23,899
Just this morning,

414
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:26,953
they barred us from covering
Tricia Nixon's wedding.

415
00:26:27,389 --> 00:26:30,741
Somehow, I doubt that will rise
to the level of catastrophe.

416
00:26:30,766 --> 00:26:33,264
No, probably not--although,

417
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,945
when Ben sets his
mind to plunder,

418
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,008
it's not hard to imagine
something more serious.

419
00:26:40,867 --> 00:26:43,056
Catastrophic events...

420
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:45,814
do occur, you know.

421
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:49,200
Yeah, but the right to
cancel is only for a week.

422
00:26:50,013 --> 00:26:52,060
A week from the public offering.

423
00:26:53,357 --> 00:26:56,357
Seven days after they ring
that bell on Tuesday,

424
00:26:56,802 --> 00:26:58,505
the deal is done.

425
00:26:58,972 --> 00:26:59,886
Hm.

426
00:27:01,523 --> 00:27:03,171
It's gonna be fine, Kay.

427
00:27:30,644 --> 00:27:32,342
Do you know what floor
the newsroom's on?

428
00:27:32,921 --> 00:27:33,843
Five.

429
00:27:34,148 --> 00:27:36,390
Uh, no, no, no,
six, yeah, six.

430
00:27:50,645 --> 00:27:52,653
You think that he's
not beneath Pakistan?

431
00:27:52,701 --> 00:27:56,435
Well, five million refugees
could destabilize West Bengal.

432
00:27:56,582 --> 00:27:58,730
So, Lindsay's lowering
the boom tomorrow.

433
00:27:58,816 --> 00:28:00,519
How's he gonna cut
a hundred million?

434
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,095
There's gonna be some blood on
the floor of a greasy mansion.

435
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:07,539
I heard the mayors gave
it to Nixon in Philly.

436
00:28:07,576 --> 00:28:09,086
Yeah, I told you those
guys are violent.

437
00:28:09,126 --> 00:28:10,399
Take a look at this.

438
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:12,831
You guys see that piece
on the hijacking?

439
00:28:13,456 --> 00:28:15,191
You think six pages is enough?

440
00:28:15,562 --> 00:28:18,468
We got three columns on
the front page. I'll take it.

441
00:28:18,552 --> 00:28:20,146
-On the flight?
-The flight.

442
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:21,927
Can I help you, mac?

443
00:28:22,972 --> 00:28:24,847
Just delivering a package
to Mr. Mietson.

444
00:28:25,274 --> 00:28:27,407
Maston, I'll see that he gets it.

445
00:28:28,994 --> 00:28:30,932
I knew a couple

446
00:28:31,471 --> 00:28:34,088
whose yacht was shipwrecked
in the South Pacific.

447
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,557
Hold on, quiet, quiet.

448
00:28:35,684 --> 00:28:38,716
I know a couple whose yacht was
shipwrecked in the South Pacific.

449
00:28:38,997 --> 00:28:41,481
It looks bleak, so the man asks,

450
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:43,487
"Does the will take
care of the kids?"

451
00:28:43,606 --> 00:28:45,778
his wife nods.
"What about your mother?"

452
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,255
Yes. Okay.

453
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:49,919
"Did we donate to Nixon?"

454
00:28:50,552 --> 00:28:52,458
His wife shakes her head.
Yes.

455
00:28:53,325 --> 00:28:55,427
"Did we pledge or give?"

456
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,052
"We pledged."

457
00:28:57,317 --> 00:28:59,395
"Thank God!", shouts the man.
"Nixon'll find us."

458
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,427
"We're saved!"

459
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:07,426
Speaking of Nixon,
I just talked to Kissinger

460
00:29:07,451 --> 00:29:10,121
who was going on about the
end of the China embargo.

461
00:29:10,325 --> 00:29:12,880
He's convinced it's a rather
clever geo-political move.

462
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:15,186
Oh, I think this is
our cue, ladies.

463
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,795
Someone at this
table of luminaries

464
00:29:17,865 --> 00:29:19,678
must have an idea
what they're up to.

465
00:29:19,719 --> 00:29:21,805
I wonder what his buddy
Joe McCarthy would say.

466
00:29:21,883 --> 00:29:25,633
The new Style section did a
lovely piece on Lawrence Durrell.

467
00:29:25,658 --> 00:29:28,399
Well, it's about time
Style had a good piece.

468
00:29:28,444 --> 00:29:30,098
I think it's a bit improved.

469
00:29:30,123 --> 00:29:32,592
I hear he's at work on
another series of novels.

470
00:29:32,632 --> 00:29:35,726
I hear he's at work on
finding a fourth wife.

471
00:29:35,751 --> 00:29:37,141
I will say, he's one of the
few individuals who could

472
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:38,943
probably cozy up
to communist China

473
00:29:39,006 --> 00:29:40,733
without fear of
major political cost.

474
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:43,639
Ah, but is Nixon that smart?
He never laughed at one of my jokes.

475
00:29:45,847 --> 00:29:47,839
Oh, Kay, I don't
know how you do it.

476
00:29:47,864 --> 00:29:49,997
I don't know how you keep
up with it over here--

477
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,669
Have this day job.

478
00:29:51,739 --> 00:29:53,028
-Oh!
-Well.

479
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:54,294
You need to read her book.

480
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,620
Kay, can I have--just a word?

481
00:29:57,864 --> 00:29:59,520
Did you get a chance
to read his--

482
00:29:59,615 --> 00:30:00,559
Um.

483
00:30:02,225 --> 00:30:03,639
Everything all right?

484
00:30:03,762 --> 00:30:05,996
-Marg okay?
-Yeah, she's- she's fine.

485
00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:07,709
The procedure went very well.

486
00:30:07,748 --> 00:30:08,998
Oh, good, I've
been meaning to...

487
00:30:09,061 --> 00:30:10,201
I, uh...

488
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,123
I wanted to tell you and I want
you to hear from me first.

489
00:30:14,186 --> 00:30:16,255
There's an article about me

490
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:18,584
coming out in
The Times tomorrow.

491
00:30:19,678 --> 00:30:21,412
It's not flattering.

492
00:30:22,748 --> 00:30:24,349
<i>Running...me?</i>

493
00:30:24,443 --> 00:30:26,419
<i> Now you know me
better than that.</i>

494
00:30:26,512 --> 00:30:28,223
<i>Three days and three nights
and not a word from you.</i>

495
00:30:28,248 --> 00:30:29,575
<i>Well, I've been very busy.</i>

496
00:30:29,774 --> 00:30:31,365
<i>For all I knew, you were
lying in the gutter somewhere</i>

497
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,828
<i>with a knife in your back.</i>

498
00:30:33,352 --> 00:30:34,672
<i>Lying in the gutter?</i>

499
00:30:35,883 --> 00:30:38,204
<i>Now, look, sweetheart, I'll
tell ya what happened.</i>

500
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:41,055
<i>I was in Birmingham.</i>

501
00:30:42,358 --> 00:30:43,217
Hello.

502
00:30:43,483 --> 00:30:44,631
<i>Hello, Ben.</i>

503
00:30:45,522 --> 00:30:46,443
Hello, Katharine.

504
00:30:46,468 --> 00:30:49,163
<i>I'm sorry to bother you
so late, but listen.</i>

505
00:30:49,476 --> 00:30:52,827
<i>Were you able to make any
headway with Mr. Sheehan?</i>

506
00:30:53,405 --> 00:30:55,855
No, no, no.
I haven't.

507
00:30:55,942 --> 00:30:59,982
<i>I just had an odd conversation
with Bob McNamara.</i>

508
00:31:00,007 --> 00:31:04,326
<i>And...I think The Times may
have a big story tomorrow.</i>

509
00:31:04,873 --> 00:31:06,686
Ah, dammit.

510
00:31:06,795 --> 00:31:09,194
<i>You know, he wouldn't
give me any details, but</i>

511
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:14,538
<i>Bob said it was quite...
detrimental to him that--</i>

512
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:37,139
Ben.

513
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,084
We got 'em.

514
00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:40,670
We got 'em.

515
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:42,605
-Ah.
-Ah?

516
00:31:42,636 --> 00:31:44,111
-Yeah, quite good.
-The happy couple?

517
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:45,860
-Hey! Chief!
-Mr. Bradlee.

518
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:48,126
So, did you track down Sheehan?

519
00:31:48,195 --> 00:31:51,710
No, but I saw a mock up
of tomorrow's front page.

520
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,023
There's a big gap.

521
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,179
Nothing there but the name.

522
00:32:00,606 --> 00:32:01,411
Shit.

523
00:32:01,974 --> 00:32:02,677
Shit.

524
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:04,818
Shit!

525
00:32:13,134 --> 00:32:14,970
-Give us three.
-Here you go, here you go, here.

526
00:32:15,173 --> 00:32:17,447
Here, here, here, here.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

527
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:19,478
Thanks, got it.

528
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,003
<i>General Haig, sir.</i>

529
00:32:27,294 --> 00:32:28,669
<i>-Hi, Al.
-Yes, sir.</i>

530
00:32:28,694 --> 00:32:30,356
<i>How, uh, what about
the casualties list--</i>

531
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:31,560
<i>you got that figure yet?</i>

532
00:32:31,592 --> 00:32:34,303
<i>No, sir, but I think it's
gonna be quite low, uh...</i>

533
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,448
<i>Fine. Okay.</i>

534
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,136
<i>Nothing else
of interest in the world?</i>

535
00:32:39,214 --> 00:32:41,714
<i>Yes, sir, very
significant this uh,</i>

536
00:32:41,768 --> 00:32:45,049
<i>goddamn New York Times exposé of</i>

537
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:48,353
<i>the most highly-classified

00:32:48,498 --> 00:32:50,865
<i>You mean that-that was
leaked out of the Pentagon?</i>

539
00:32:50,943 --> 00:32:54,880
<i>The-the whole study that
was done for McNamara.</i>

540
00:32:55,231 --> 00:32:59,521
<i>This is a devastating,
uh, security breach of</i>

541
00:32:59,606 --> 00:33:01,018
<i>of the greatest

542
00:33:01,043 --> 00:33:02,099
<i>-I've ever seen
-Well...</i>

543
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:04,130
<i>Well, what, uh, what's being
done about it, then?</i>

544
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,800
<i>-I...
-Did we know this was coming out?</i>

545
00:33:05,855 --> 00:33:07,362
<i>No, we did not, sir.</i>

546
00:33:07,603 --> 00:33:09,103
<i>I have Dr. Kissinger.</i>

547
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:11,658
<i>Uh, Henry, that thing to
me is just unconscionable--</i>

548
00:33:11,683 --> 00:33:13,128
<i>this is treasonable action</i>

549
00:33:13,153 --> 00:33:15,308
<i>on the part of the

550
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,887
<i>I'm absolutely certain</i>

551
00:33:18,097 --> 00:33:21,613
<i>that this violates all
sorts of security...laws--</i>

552
00:33:21,676 --> 00:33:24,231
<i>People have got to be put to the
torch for this sort of thing.</i>

553
00:33:26,856 --> 00:33:27,801
Christ!

554
00:33:27,826 --> 00:33:30,341
McNamara knew we
couldn't win in '65--

555
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:32,879
that's six goddamn years ago.

556
00:33:35,943 --> 00:33:37,661
Well, at least we
got the wedding.

557
00:33:40,415 --> 00:33:43,477
Is anybody else tired or reading
the news instead of reporting it?

558
00:33:44,477 --> 00:33:45,782
Do we have any leads?

559
00:33:45,807 --> 00:33:47,188
There's a guy Phil
and I know in Boston

560
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:49,555
who worked at Defense when
McNamara commissioned the study.

561
00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:51,001
All right, call him.

562
00:33:51,508 --> 00:33:52,547
Anybody else?

563
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:54,328
So that's it?

564
00:33:55,196 --> 00:33:57,797
My best goddamn lead is
coming from editorial?

565
00:33:58,852 --> 00:34:01,329
We are suckin' high tit
in our own backyard.

566
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,305
Ben, come on, it's one story.

567
00:34:03,334 --> 00:34:06,810
No, it's 7,000 pages
detailing how the White House

568
00:34:06,907 --> 00:34:09,211
has been lying about the
Vietnam war for 30 years.

569
00:34:09,236 --> 00:34:11,548
It's Truman and
Eisenhower and...

570
00:34:11,587 --> 00:34:12,993
Jack...

571
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:16,024
LBJ lying--lying about

572
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,484
Vietnam--and you think
that's one story?

573
00:34:19,988 --> 00:34:21,746
Let's do our jobs.

574
00:34:23,332 --> 00:34:24,832
Find those pages.

575
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,433
Ben, uh...

576
00:34:30,886 --> 00:34:33,941
I might...have something...
maybe.

577
00:34:33,966 --> 00:34:36,712
Well, let me know when
it's a little less...wishy-washy.

578
00:34:36,751 --> 00:34:39,501
I'm gonna go chase
down a lead of my own.

579
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:45,920
Why don't you cut your bangs?

580
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:47,240
-Mummy,
-Just a little bit.

581
00:34:47,265 --> 00:34:48,662
I'm right in the middle.

582
00:34:54,503 --> 00:34:56,901
It's a bit hard to read,
isn't it?

583
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,182
Harder for you, I imagine.

584
00:35:00,001 --> 00:35:01,243
No.

585
00:35:01,704 --> 00:35:02,774
Why?

586
00:35:03,813 --> 00:35:06,438
These were your
people--McNamara?

587
00:35:06,969 --> 00:35:09,226
And Kennedy and Johnson.

588
00:35:09,289 --> 00:35:11,414
Jack and Lyndon were
your father's friends.

589
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:14,009
You flew down to Texas with Lyndon
the weekend after his convention.

590
00:35:14,034 --> 00:35:16,337
Well, that's your fault, you
wanted to see his helicopter.

591
00:35:16,362 --> 00:35:18,854
And the instant he saw you,
he invited you to the ranch.

592
00:35:18,879 --> 00:35:21,128
Oh, well, he just wanted
the paper to endorse--

593
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:24,347
Yes, but my point is, you had
Steve and Bill waiting at home

594
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:25,604
-who had houseguests
-I know.

595
00:35:25,629 --> 00:35:26,987
waiting at the farm.

596
00:35:27,074 --> 00:35:28,629
You had nothing but dirty
clothes in your suitcase.

597
00:35:28,654 --> 00:35:30,340
How do you know what
I had in my suitcase?

598
00:35:30,407 --> 00:35:32,078
Jumped on Air Force Once,
spent the weekend--

599
00:35:32,102 --> 00:35:33,930
-I did not jump, you and
-swimming and

600
00:35:33,955 --> 00:35:35,337
Livvie Pearce and
said "I had to go!"

601
00:35:35,362 --> 00:35:37,251
speedboating with
Lyndon and Lady Bird.

602
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:44,291
It's hard to say...

603
00:35:45,422 --> 00:35:48,150
no to the President
of the United States.

604
00:35:53,164 --> 00:35:54,711
Were you expecting someone?

605
00:35:55,227 --> 00:35:56,406
At this hour?

606
00:36:01,922 --> 00:36:04,196
I hope I'm not too early.

607
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,684
Not at all, must be urgent.

608
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,801
Where's your sister?

609
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,380
It's mine too, darling.

610
00:36:12,701 --> 00:36:14,123
Where's your sister?

611
00:36:14,498 --> 00:36:15,388
Let's go find her.

612
00:36:20,066 --> 00:36:22,081
I trust you saw
the New York Times.

613
00:36:23,023 --> 00:36:23,890
Hmm.

614
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:26,015
The study--the-the one
they're working off

615
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,914
that was commissioned
by McNamara.

616
00:36:28,047 --> 00:36:28,843
Yeah.

617
00:36:28,868 --> 00:36:30,937
And if he commissioned it,
he might have a copy.

618
00:36:36,547 --> 00:36:39,243
I need to tell you that
finding a source

619
00:36:39,268 --> 00:36:40,884
is like finding a
needle in a haystack.

620
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:42,111
I don't need the metaphor.

621
00:36:42,136 --> 00:36:43,397
I haven't been a
writer for a while

622
00:36:43,422 --> 00:36:45,072
so that old cliché--
that was the best comparison

623
00:36:45,097 --> 00:36:46,782
I could come up with.

624
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:50,298
I need a copy
of that study, Kay.

625
00:36:52,727 --> 00:36:53,805
Give her the ball, Ben.

626
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,329
-Oh, here you go.
-Thank you.

627
00:36:58,048 --> 00:37:01,102
You know, Ben,
as much as I do relish

628
00:37:01,127 --> 00:37:02,977
a good investigative assignment,

629
00:37:03,935 --> 00:37:07,050
-Bob McNamara's an old friend.
-Mm.

630
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:09,957
He's going through a lot in
his life right now. I just--

631
00:37:10,105 --> 00:37:12,433
He's probably said
all he wants to say.

632
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:14,332
Why, do you think?

633
00:37:14,764 --> 00:37:15,951
-Why?
-Why?

634
00:37:16,061 --> 00:37:17,537
Why is he talking to you?

635
00:37:17,562 --> 00:37:19,881
Well, I just told you
he's my friend, and

636
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:21,889
Well, is he talking
to any other friends?

637
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:28,001
I'm not sure I appreciate the
implication of what you just--

638
00:37:28,026 --> 00:37:30,220
McNamara is talking to you

639
00:37:30,267 --> 00:37:32,095
-because you are the publisher
-That's not true!

640
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,564
-of The Washington Post.
-No.

641
00:37:33,611 --> 00:37:34,713
-That is not why.
-Because he wants you

642
00:37:34,745 --> 00:37:35,776
to bail him out.

643
00:37:35,801 --> 00:37:37,886
-No, there's no ulterior--
-Because he wants you on his side.

644
00:37:37,911 --> 00:37:40,911
No, Ben, that's not my role.
You know that.

645
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,137
I wouldn't presume to tell
you how to write about him.

646
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,694
Just as I wouldn't

647
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:48,843
take it upon myself
to tell him

648
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:51,828
he should hand over
a classified study,

649
00:37:51,906 --> 00:37:54,281
which would be a crime,
by the way,

650
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,937
just so he can serve
as your source.

651
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,875
<i>Our</i> source, Katharine.

652
00:38:12,539 --> 00:38:14,055
No, I--no.

653
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:15,837
I'm not. I'm not going to

654
00:38:16,407 --> 00:38:17,805
ask Bob for the study.

655
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:18,856
I...

656
00:38:19,028 --> 00:38:21,864
I get it, you have a
relationship with Bob McNamara.

657
00:38:22,698 --> 00:38:25,767
But don't you think you
have an obligation as well

658
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:27,760
to the paper and to the public?

659
00:38:27,823 --> 00:38:29,135
Let me ask you something.

660
00:38:29,366 --> 00:38:30,811
Was that how you
felt when you were

661
00:38:30,937 --> 00:38:32,733
palling around
with Jack Kennedy?

662
00:38:33,217 --> 00:38:35,413
Where was your sense
of duty then?

663
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:39,413
I don't recall you pushing him
particularly hard on anything.

664
00:38:40,104 --> 00:38:43,737
I pushed Jack when I had to--
I never pulled any punches.

665
00:38:43,784 --> 00:38:45,036
I-Is that right?

666
00:38:45,137 --> 00:38:47,935
'Cause you used to dine at the
White House once a week.

667
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,271
All the trips to Camp David.

668
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:53,481
Oh, and that drunken birthday
cruise on the Sequoia

669
00:38:53,528 --> 00:38:54,904
you told me about.

670
00:38:56,538 --> 00:38:59,491
Hard to believe you would've
gotten all those invitations

671
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:00,834
if you didn't

672
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,640
pull a few punches.

00:39:48,794 --> 00:39:51,177
And my brother Mario said,

689
00:39:51,534 --> 00:39:55,769
"There is a time when the operation
of the machine becomes so odious

690
00:39:56,003 --> 00:39:58,706
"that you've got to put
your body upon the gears

691
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:01,075
"and upon the wheels
and upon the levers

692
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,250
"and you've got to make it stop!"

693
00:40:03,524 --> 00:40:04,836
One, two, three, four!

694
00:40:05,024 --> 00:40:07,047
We don't want
your stinkin' war!

695
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,182
One, two, three, four!

696
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:13,481
So that the President
doesn't have to admit something

697
00:40:13,528 --> 00:40:14,974
the entire world already knows.

698
00:40:14,999 --> 00:40:17,709
You dinner with Mr. and Mrs.
Rosenthal's at 7:00 in the Oak Room.

699
00:40:17,787 --> 00:40:19,646
And then I'll meet you tomorrow
morning in the lobby at 8:00

700
00:40:19,671 --> 00:40:21,967
so you'll have plenty of time to
get Downtown before the offering,

701
00:40:21,992 --> 00:40:23,350
-And the...
-and the breakfast.

702
00:40:28,304 --> 00:40:30,578
-Bagdikian.
<i>-It's Harry Rowan.</i>

703
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,640
Hey, um...

704
00:40:32,828 --> 00:40:35,085
Let me call you back from
outside the newsroom.

705
00:40:57,516 --> 00:40:58,914
Excuse me.

706
00:40:59,914 --> 00:41:01,297
Are you important?

707
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:03,788
I'm a general standard reporter.

708
00:41:04,038 --> 00:41:04,991
Okay.

709
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:39,537
Uh, I think I got something.

710
00:41:40,006 --> 00:41:41,326
Be my guest.

711
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,639
And they are the
source of the story.

712
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:46,091
Every time I read The New
York Times above the fold--

713
00:41:46,116 --> 00:41:47,298
-Mr. Bradlee?
-No.

714
00:41:47,384 --> 00:41:49,501
I feel like somebody's shoving
a hot poker up my ass.

715
00:41:54,673 --> 00:41:56,041
I think I got something.

716
00:42:04,679 --> 00:42:05,750
Where'd you get these?

717
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:07,414
Somebody left them on my desk.

718
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:13,789
None was secretly
suggesting that McNamara

719
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:16,578
did provoke the North so we'd
have grounds for escalation.

720
00:42:16,636 --> 00:42:19,107
Yeah, it was in The Times
article. It was a good piece.

721
00:42:19,163 --> 00:42:19,865
You should check it out.

722
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:21,139
-It was well--
-Jesus Christ.

723
00:42:21,194 --> 00:42:23,803
Give it to someone who can
type 91 words a minute.

724
00:42:23,842 --> 00:42:25,499
-Ben.
-and have it proofed, okay?

725
00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:26,553
-Ben.
-Yeah.

726
00:42:26,733 --> 00:42:28,022
I think we got something.

727
00:42:28,593 --> 00:42:29,710
What is it?

728
00:42:38,025 --> 00:42:39,291
Jesus Christ.

729
00:42:40,373 --> 00:42:43,256
Shit. Are these part of the
pages of the McNamara study?

730
00:42:43,281 --> 00:42:44,326
Where did you get these?

731
00:42:44,412 --> 00:42:45,771
Somebody left them on my desk.

732
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:47,132
On your desk?

733
00:42:47,281 --> 00:42:48,859
I didn't--i-it was a woman.

734
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:50,506
-What a woman?
-We got over a

735
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,818
-hundred pages of the McNamara
-What woman?

736
00:42:51,843 --> 00:42:53,443
-study here.
-She was a hippie woman,

737
00:42:53,513 --> 00:42:54,623
she had one of those, uh,

738
00:42:54,648 --> 00:42:55,795
-Hey, Debbie, give me Bagdikian.
-Don't know what they're called

739
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:56,811
-but it's one of those skirts
-He's uh,

740
00:42:56,836 --> 00:42:58,000
-that looks like your uh,
-He's out, he just went

741
00:42:58,063 --> 00:42:59,602
-swirling in colors.
-somewhere

742
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:01,093
-I don't--
-Probably between 5'4 and 5'6.

743
00:43:01,117 --> 00:43:03,094
Well, these are the real thing.

744
00:43:03,232 --> 00:43:04,154
Oh, she's uh,

745
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:05,505
-We are back in the ballgame.
-It was a tie-died, sir.

746
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:06,534
It was a tie-died skirt.

747
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:09,119
This is gonna be the
front page of tomorrow's

748
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:10,683
paper. Um...

749
00:43:10,768 --> 00:43:12,026
Give it to uh...

750
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:14,046
give it to Marder,
it's his lucky day.

751
00:43:20,341 --> 00:43:21,918
My God, the fun.

752
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:25,988
<i>Rand Corporation.</i>

753
00:43:26,013 --> 00:43:27,419
Harry Rowan, please.

754
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:33,989
<i>This is Harry.</i>

755
00:43:34,014 --> 00:43:36,022
Harry, it's Ben Bagdikian.

756
00:43:36,428 --> 00:43:38,373
<i>You think someone's
bugging your phone?</i>

757
00:43:38,444 --> 00:43:40,569
I think someone might
be bugging yours.

758
00:43:41,866 --> 00:43:43,898
<i>Why would someone
bug my phone?</i>

759
00:43:44,525 --> 00:43:46,838
If I thought the McNamara
study had leaked from Rand,

760
00:43:46,863 --> 00:43:49,440
I'd bug the phone of
the president of Rand.

761
00:43:50,407 --> 00:43:51,774
<i>It's a DOD study.</i>

762
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:54,478
A copy of which was sent
to Rand for safekeeping.

763
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:56,634
Two copies,
if I'm not mistaken.

764
00:43:58,118 --> 00:44:00,954
<i>Jesus Christ, Ben, that
leak didn't come from us.</i>

765
00:44:01,258 --> 00:44:02,571
You sure about that?

766
00:44:03,478 --> 00:44:04,962
Look, in my experience,

767
00:44:05,071 --> 00:44:07,773
guys who want stuff like this out
there and have the guts to do it,

768
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,203
they're a particular type--

769
00:44:09,228 --> 00:44:10,515
they've got conscience
and conviction

770
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:12,029
but they've also got

771
00:44:12,092 --> 00:44:13,107
ego.

772
00:44:13,373 --> 00:44:15,287
Now, there's a guy
that we both know.

773
00:44:15,357 --> 00:44:17,527
Okay? He was there
the same time as I was.

774
00:44:17,552 --> 00:44:18,857
He left right after.

775
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,783
You know who I'm
talkin' about, right?

776
00:44:20,939 --> 00:44:22,173
Isn't he the first
guy you thought of

777
00:44:22,198 --> 00:44:24,353
when you saw the
article in The Times?

778
00:44:27,361 --> 00:44:29,455
<i>Okay, look, I gotta go.</i>

779
00:44:37,656 --> 00:44:38,906
Mr. and Mrs. Rosenthal.

780
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,117
-Oh, yes, I see.
-You're welcome.

781
00:44:43,862 --> 00:44:44,784
Hi.

782
00:44:44,995 --> 00:44:46,565
-Ah.
-Sweets.

783
00:44:46,623 --> 00:44:48,942
I'm just going to
apologize in advance.

784
00:44:49,028 --> 00:44:49,943
Great to see you.

785
00:44:49,968 --> 00:44:51,122
I'm no fun at all, Abe.

786
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:53,420
-I'm just so nervous about
-Huh?

787
00:44:53,554 --> 00:44:56,833
tomorrow at the Stock Exchange,
I have to make a big speech...

788
00:44:56,858 --> 00:44:58,358
-No, no, no, no.
-I'm so happy for you.

789
00:44:58,383 --> 00:45:00,835
No, going public is a
good move for The Post.

790
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:02,883
Maybe you can even
think about expanding,

791
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,524
try to be more of
a national paper.

792
00:45:05,306 --> 00:45:07,041
I wish Abe would
let me buy shares.

793
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:09,337
Ah, that's against
company policy, but

794
00:45:09,439 --> 00:45:11,634
if your nervous and
need distraction, I--

795
00:45:11,939 --> 00:45:14,155
I do happen to have a
copy of today's Times.

796
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:15,468
-Oh!
-Abe!

797
00:45:16,479 --> 00:45:17,752
Unless you read it already.

798
00:45:18,502 --> 00:45:21,423
You awful man,
you really are.

799
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:23,143
Can we get you
something to drink?

800
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:25,214
Bundy argues for
sustained bombing.

801
00:45:25,301 --> 00:45:28,809
He thinks it'll turn the tide.
This is February of '65.

802
00:45:28,949 --> 00:45:32,473
Yeah, 'cause by April,
they realize it's not gonna cut it.

803
00:45:32,498 --> 00:45:34,512
And LBJ sends two battalions.

804
00:45:34,537 --> 00:45:35,738
-Great stuff.
-And get this--

805
00:45:35,763 --> 00:45:38,410
He changes the mission
from base security

806
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:40,035
-to active combat.
-My God.

807
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,584
It's a huge shift.
He's widening the war.

808
00:45:42,662 --> 00:45:43,909
But he insists on secrecy.

809
00:45:43,936 --> 00:45:45,936
The American people
are not to be told.

810
00:45:45,961 --> 00:45:47,600
Okay, so this is the real deal.

811
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:49,397
So how long till you
can write it up?

812
00:45:49,422 --> 00:45:50,805
I can have it for Thursday.

813
00:45:50,844 --> 00:45:53,946
Well, what if we pretend you
were a poet and not a novelist?

814
00:45:54,071 --> 00:45:57,305
I...I suppose I could pull something
together by tomorrow night.

815
00:45:57,399 --> 00:45:59,235
Okay, we can run
it on Wednesday.

816
00:46:05,908 --> 00:46:07,330
Just go through all
the research you want

817
00:46:07,355 --> 00:46:10,003
but so help me God if we
don't have these pages

818
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:11,304
by tomorrow night,
we might as well...

819
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:12,416
Too late.

820
00:46:14,455 --> 00:46:16,830
-What?
-The Times already has it.

821
00:46:20,823 --> 00:46:22,198
Well of course they have it.

822
00:46:22,284 --> 00:46:24,986
"President Johnson decided
on April 1st, 1965

823
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:26,314
-"that American ground forces
-Of course The Times have it.

824
00:46:26,339 --> 00:46:28,065
-"were taking offensive
-written by Neil Sheehan.

825
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:29,441
"because a month of bombing--"

826
00:46:29,876 --> 00:46:32,954
<i>You know, Sheehan's a bastard--
he's been a bastard for years.</i>

827
00:46:33,094 --> 00:46:35,838
<i>Mr. President, the Attorney
General's called a couple of times</i>

828
00:46:35,866 --> 00:46:38,291
<i>about these New
York Times stories.</i>

829
00:46:38,745 --> 00:46:40,565
<i>You mean to prosecute
The Times?</i>

830
00:46:40,604 --> 00:46:42,002
<i>Hell, my view is to prosecute</i>

831
00:46:42,027 --> 00:46:44,018
<i>the goddamn pricks
that gave it to him.</i>

832
00:46:44,064 --> 00:46:45,434
<i>If you can find out
who that is.</i>

833
00:46:45,459 --> 00:46:46,278
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

834
00:46:46,372 --> 00:46:48,403
<i>I mean, could The
Times be prosecuted?</i>

835
00:46:48,428 --> 00:46:49,669
<i>Apparently so.</i>

836
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,559
<i>As far as The Times
is concerned,</i>

837
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:54,169
<i>hell, they're our enemies,
I think we just ought to do it.</i>

838
00:46:55,202 --> 00:46:56,514
Son of a bitch.

839
00:47:00,321 --> 00:47:01,486
Abe Rosenthal.

840
00:47:01,556 --> 00:47:02,516
Oh, good evening.

841
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:04,275
Your table is
right over there, sir.

842
00:47:08,566 --> 00:47:11,402
On no uncertain terms
not to publish.

843
00:47:11,575 --> 00:47:13,590
Only after Scotty Redstein

844
00:47:13,615 --> 00:47:15,465
threatened to publish
in the Vineyard Gazette

845
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,951
did Punch decide to print.

846
00:47:16,976 --> 00:47:18,779
Wouldn't have had
quite the same impact.

847
00:47:20,503 --> 00:47:21,628
Jimmy.

848
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:24,980
We've been asked

849
00:47:25,011 --> 00:47:27,237
to refrain from
further publication

850
00:47:27,379 --> 00:47:29,105
by the Attorney General.

851
00:47:30,951 --> 00:47:32,849
Nixon's taking us to court?

852
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,031
Kay, I'm sorry, I uh...

853
00:47:41,056 --> 00:47:42,125
Oh, no.

854
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:47,079
Gosh.

855
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,843
Why don't I go get the check?

856
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:56,826
No, sit tight, don't argue with,
be right back.

857
00:48:02,848 --> 00:48:05,051
Mr. Rosenthal had to
leave on business.

858
00:48:05,129 --> 00:48:07,010
Certainly, we'll put it on his tab.

859
00:48:07,035 --> 00:48:08,963
No, no, I'll take the bill, but

860
00:48:09,027 --> 00:48:10,745
could I trouble you
to use your telephone?

861
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:12,018
But of course, madame.

862
00:48:20,204 --> 00:48:22,257
There's a fella
I overlap with at Rand

863
00:48:22,282 --> 00:48:24,438
he was a bit of a showboat
but smart.

864
00:48:24,509 --> 00:48:27,079
And he worked for McNamara
and he had opinions

865
00:48:27,149 --> 00:48:29,587
on the decision-making
that went into Vietnam.

866
00:48:30,188 --> 00:48:32,196
-Okay.
-Word is

867
00:48:32,235 --> 00:48:33,126
he doved

868
00:48:33,172 --> 00:48:34,110
pretty hard.

869
00:48:34,297 --> 00:48:36,141
Would he have access
to the study?

870
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:37,989
Pretty sure Rand had a copy.

871
00:48:38,476 --> 00:48:41,117
No shit. All right, well,
can you find him?

872
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:43,023
Thought maybe I'd try.

873
00:48:47,154 --> 00:48:48,935
<i>I've got Mrs.
Graham on the line.</i>

874
00:48:50,654 --> 00:48:51,864
Katharine!

875
00:48:52,166 --> 00:48:53,900
<i>Hey, listen, I've--</i>

876
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:56,494
<i>-I've got tomorrow's headlines.</i>
-Ah.

877
00:48:56,572 --> 00:48:58,916
Christ, okay, again.

878
00:48:59,129 --> 00:49:01,222
<i>John Mitchell
contacted The Times,</i>

879
00:49:01,262 --> 00:49:04,035
<i>seems the President's going
to seek an injunction</i>

880
00:49:04,678 --> 00:49:06,374
No shit!

881
00:49:07,178 --> 00:49:08,875
This means we're in
the goddamn ballgame.

882
00:49:09,459 --> 00:49:11,561
Because if The Times
get shut down...

883
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,225
<i>If they get shut down,
there is no ballgame.</i>

884
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:15,577
<i>Ballgame's over.</i>

885
00:49:15,624 --> 00:49:19,265
But Katharine, any-anybody
would kill to have a crack at this.

886
00:49:19,327 --> 00:49:22,179
<i>Well, sure, but not if
it means breaking the law.</i>

887
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:25,715
<i>If a federal judge stops
The Times from publishing,</i>

888
00:49:25,872 --> 00:49:28,801
<i>well, I don't see how
we could publish--</i>

889
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,934
<i>even if we could get
hold of a copy.</i>

890
00:49:31,037 --> 00:49:32,059
<i>So.</i>

891
00:49:34,028 --> 00:49:34,966
<i>Ben?</i>

892
00:49:35,769 --> 00:49:36,996
<i>You have something?</i>

893
00:49:38,371 --> 00:49:39,402
No.

894
00:49:40,264 --> 00:49:43,139
<i>Okay, so then there's nothing
to talk about, really.</i>

895
00:49:43,178 --> 00:49:46,264
No. Nothing to talk
about at all, but uh...

896
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,537
But thank you for the tip,
Mrs. uh, Graham.

897
00:49:50,092 --> 00:49:51,436
What are you still doing here?

898
00:50:21,363 --> 00:50:22,176
Hi.

899
00:50:27,937 --> 00:50:30,530
-How are you, Kay?
-Hi, everyone. Good to see you.

900
00:50:30,726 --> 00:50:31,520
<i>Hello?</i>

901
00:50:31,545 --> 00:50:33,341
Yeah, I'm looking for Dan Ellsberg.

902
00:50:33,544 --> 00:50:35,091
<i>He doesn't work here anymore.</i>

903
00:50:35,263 --> 00:50:36,770
Do you know where he is now?

904
00:50:36,981 --> 00:50:38,872
<i>No, I don't. Who's this?</i>

905
00:50:39,122 --> 00:50:40,372
Thank you.

906
00:50:40,606 --> 00:50:42,575
And it is my great privilege

907
00:50:42,638 --> 00:50:45,200
to welcome
The Washington Post Company

908
00:50:45,324 --> 00:50:47,668
to the
American Stock Exchange!

909
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,077
More than a privilege,
Mrs. Graham,

910
00:50:55,102 --> 00:50:56,428
this is a real honor.

911
00:50:57,428 --> 00:50:58,452
<i>Hello, this is John's.</i>

912
00:50:58,477 --> 00:50:59,974
Yeah, I'm looking
for Dan Ellsberg.

913
00:50:59,999 --> 00:51:01,124
<i>You got the wrong number.</i>

914
00:51:04,991 --> 00:51:06,647
Go check off this day.

915
00:51:09,136 --> 00:51:10,238
Gentlemen.

916
00:51:11,127 --> 00:51:14,604
Thank you all for helping make
The Washington Post

917
00:51:14,629 --> 00:51:16,416
a more robust company.

918
00:51:18,456 --> 00:51:20,339
<i>Center for
International Studies.</i>

919
00:51:20,426 --> 00:51:21,973
Yeah, I'm looking
for Dan Ellsberg.

920
00:51:22,074 --> 00:51:23,293
<i>He's not here.</i>

921
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,230
But he still works there?

922
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,348
<i>Yes.</i>

923
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,027
<i>Can I take a message?</i>

924
00:51:29,133 --> 00:51:32,062
Uh, tell him
Ben Bagdikian called.

925
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:33,431
Congratulations.

926
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,446
Guys, why don't we get
together for a photograph?

927
00:51:35,711 --> 00:51:37,618
That's a good idea.
Here we go.

928
00:51:38,203 --> 00:51:39,336
Smile, Kay!

929
00:51:39,405 --> 00:51:40,233
What is it?

930
00:51:40,272 --> 00:51:41,678
You just bought a
share of The Post!

931
00:51:41,858 --> 00:51:44,155
I know, I'm so happy!

932
00:51:44,335 --> 00:51:49,155
1.35 million shares
at 24.50 a share.

933
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:55,005
I believe this will not
only make The Post solvent,

934
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:57,075
but stronger than
it ever has been.

935
00:51:57,145 --> 00:51:58,559
-To The Post!
-The Post!

936
00:51:58,622 --> 00:52:00,168
He said to call
from a secure phone.

937
00:52:00,193 --> 00:52:01,216
Mm-hmm.

938
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:11,560
I hear Kennedy said Phil Graham
was the smartest man he ever met.

939
00:52:12,022 --> 00:52:14,444
For Kay's father to hand her
husband the company,

940
00:52:14,538 --> 00:52:15,775
it says something about the guy.

941
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,306
Ben!

942
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:18,186
You thought it said
something about the time.

943
00:52:19,449 --> 00:52:20,480
-Turn it up.
<i>-Good evening.</i>

944
00:52:20,582 --> 00:52:23,191

Hell, why bother
fighting the communists?

959
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,658
I think Jefferson just
rolled over in his grave.

960
00:52:51,776 --> 00:52:54,307
Have the courts ever stopped a
paper from publishing before?

961
00:52:54,455 --> 00:52:56,471
Not in the history of the Republic.

962
00:52:58,111 --> 00:53:00,010
Good thing we're not
part of this mess.

963
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:02,283
I'd give my left one
to be in this mess.

964
00:53:03,385 --> 00:53:04,978
There's our front page lead.

965
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:07,018
Tomorrow, Chal, that's yours.

966
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,043
All right.

967
00:53:10,114 --> 00:53:12,919
Party's over, let's uh,
get back to work, germs.

968
00:53:12,959 --> 00:53:15,922
<i>...in a news conference to

974
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,684
Oh, um,

975
00:53:34,777 --> 00:53:36,926
I'm trying to get hold of
a fella I used to know.

976

<i>617-597-4580.</i>

Oh!

978
00:53:44,372 --> 00:53:45,551
Hold-Hold on.

979
00:53:47,278 --> 00:53:49,786
-Was it 4580, 61--?
<i>-Call from another phone.</i>

980
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:52,340

<i>-Yeah. Hey, Ben, it's Dan.</i>

987
00:54:22,172 --> 00:54:23,359
Dan!

988
00:54:24,229 --> 00:54:25,448
It's good to hear your voice.

989
00:54:25,612 --> 00:54:26,901
<i>Yeah, it's been a while.</i>

990
00:54:27,096 --> 00:54:28,104
Yeah.

991
00:54:46,395 --> 00:54:48,661
-Who is it?
-It's Ben.

992
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,068
Ben.

993
00:54:59,786 --> 00:55:00,654
Dan.

994
00:55:06,722 --> 00:55:09,042
The study had 47 volumes.

995
00:55:09,198 --> 00:55:10,916
I slipped out a
couple at a time,

996
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,596
took me months
to copy it all.

997
00:55:16,464 --> 00:55:17,620
What the hell?

998
00:55:17,659 --> 00:55:20,339
Well, we were all
former government guys.

999
00:55:20,714 --> 00:55:22,167
Top clearance, all that.

1000
00:55:22,447 --> 00:55:24,658
McNamara wanted academics
to have the chance

1001
00:55:24,683 --> 00:55:26,229
to examine
what had happened.

1002
00:55:26,385 --> 00:55:28,931
He would say to us, "Let the
chips fall where they may."

1003
00:55:29,050 --> 00:55:30,128
Brave man.

1004
00:55:30,153 --> 00:55:33,339
Well, I think guilt was a
bigger motivator than courage.

1005
00:55:33,389 --> 00:55:35,170
McNamara didn't lie
as well as the rest.

1006
00:55:35,195 --> 00:55:37,405
But I-I don't think he
saw what was coming,

1007
00:55:37,539 --> 00:55:40,023
what we'd find, but it didn't
take him long to figure out--

1008
00:55:40,048 --> 00:55:41,472
well, for us all to figure out.

1009
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:43,035
If the public ever
saw these papers,

1010
00:55:43,066 --> 00:55:44,660
they would turn
against the war.

1011
00:55:45,137 --> 00:55:46,840
Covert ops, guaranteed debt,

1012
00:55:46,886 --> 00:55:49,168
rigged elections,
it's all in there.

1013
00:55:49,364 --> 00:55:51,324
Ike, Kennedy, Johnson--

1014
00:55:51,971 --> 00:55:53,698
They violated the
Geneva Convention,

1015
00:55:53,752 --> 00:55:56,104
and they lied to Congress
and they lied to the public.

1016
00:55:56,487 --> 00:55:58,321
They knew we couldn't win

1017
00:55:58,399 --> 00:56:00,204
and still sent boys to die.

1018
00:56:00,368 --> 00:56:01,852
What about Nixon?

1019
00:56:03,312 --> 00:56:05,554
He's just carrying on
like all the others.

1020
00:56:05,797 --> 00:56:08,953
Too afraid to be the one who
loses the war on his watch.

1021
00:56:09,962 --> 00:56:11,861
Someone said this at

1022
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:14,322
some point about
why we stayed

1023
00:56:14,347 --> 00:56:15,924
when we knew we were losing.

1024
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:19,119
Ten percent was to help
the South Vietnamese.

1025
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:21,596
Twenty percent was to
hold back the commies.

1026
00:56:21,895 --> 00:56:24,098
Seventy percent was to avoid

1027
00:56:24,123 --> 00:56:26,692
the humiliation
of an American defeat.

1028
00:56:27,098 --> 00:56:29,020
Seventy percent

1029
00:56:29,262 --> 00:56:30,825
of those boys

1030
00:56:31,122 --> 00:56:33,473
just to avoid being humiliated?

1031
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:35,844
That stuck with me.

1032
00:56:44,793 --> 00:56:46,637
They're gonna come
after you, you know?

1033
00:56:46,911 --> 00:56:48,496
And I gotta be honest,

1034
00:56:48,961 --> 00:56:51,523
the bread crumbs weren't
too hard to follow.

1035
00:56:53,321 --> 00:56:54,414
I know.

1036
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:58,672
They're gonna lock you up, Dan.,

1037
00:56:59,188 --> 00:57:01,688
Wouldn't <i>you</i> go to
prison to stop this war?

1038
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:06,071
Theoretically, sure.

1039
00:57:09,548 --> 00:57:12,986
You <i>are</i> gonna publish
these documents?

1040
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,322
Yeah.

1041
00:57:17,558 --> 00:57:19,769
Even with the injunction.

1042
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:22,652
Yes.

1043
00:57:26,956 --> 00:57:29,839
Well, then, it's not so
theoretical then, is it?

1044
00:57:40,578 --> 00:57:43,063
I'm gonna go do some
work in the studio.

1045
00:57:51,986 --> 00:57:54,596
My day was great,
thanks for asking.

1046
00:58:11,382 --> 00:58:13,257
That picture makes me sad.

1047
00:58:15,175 --> 00:58:16,277
Me too.

1048
00:58:22,007 --> 00:58:22,875
Bradlee.

1049
00:58:22,913 --> 00:58:24,015
<i>I'm in Boston.</i>

1050
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,867
I'm gonna need two seats.

1051
00:58:26,033 --> 00:58:27,103
Why?

1052
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,603
I'm gonna need to buy

1053
00:58:28,628 --> 00:58:30,611
two seats on the first
flight out tomorrow--

1054
00:58:30,714 --> 00:58:32,666
probably first class.

1055
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:34,739
No shit, you have them.

1056
00:58:37,602 --> 00:58:40,165
Well, you just get your
ass back here, and uh...

1057
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:41,533
Come straight to the house.

1058
00:58:41,558 --> 00:58:42,877
Forget Chal and Meg
and the others,

1059
00:58:42,902 --> 00:58:45,073
I don't want the whole newsroom
knowing about this yet.

1060
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:46,938
I gotta go.

1061
00:58:46,993 --> 00:58:49,430
Didn't you just invite
a bunch of people over?

1062
00:58:49,469 --> 00:58:50,501
Yeah.

1063
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:51,466
Yeah, they'll uh,

1064
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:52,594
they'll show up
sometime tomorrow.

1065
00:58:52,619 --> 00:58:54,875
When, sometime tomorrow?
Is this a breakfast thing?

1066
00:58:54,954 --> 00:58:56,664
-or a lunch thing?
-Don't know. Don't know.

1067
00:58:56,689 --> 00:58:57,781
Do you need me to get things?

1068
00:58:57,806 --> 00:58:59,172
Yeah, we'll figure it all out.

1069
00:58:59,197 --> 00:59:00,579
Okay, well, where are you going?

1070
00:59:00,844 --> 00:59:01,610
Out.

1071
00:59:01,688 --> 00:59:04,141
-You going to the newsroom?
-No. Love you, bear.

1072
00:59:05,977 --> 00:59:07,821
I got a cake, I hope it's okay?

1073
00:59:07,846 --> 00:59:10,860
Oh, sure, as long as
nobody counts the candles.

1074
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,830
I'm sorry to barge in again.

1075
00:59:15,547 --> 00:59:17,539
Maybe I should give you a key.

1076
00:59:17,564 --> 00:59:20,588
Uh, I'm not here to
crash your party.

1077
00:59:20,692 --> 00:59:21,591
What's up?

1078
00:59:21,616 --> 00:59:22,919
Well, I could use a minute.

1079
00:59:30,849 --> 00:59:32,497
So, can I ask you a
hypothetical question?

1080
00:59:32,522 --> 00:59:35,333
Oh, dear, I don't like
hypothetical questions.

1081
00:59:35,358 --> 00:59:37,553
Well, I don't think you're gonna
like the real one, either.

1082
00:59:41,312 --> 00:59:42,812
Do you have the papers?

1083
00:59:44,397 --> 00:59:45,663
Not yet.

1084
00:59:49,226 --> 00:59:52,765
Oh, gosh, oh, gosh,
because you know the-the uh

1085
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:55,163
position that would put me in.

1086
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:58,624
You know, we have language
in the prospectus...

1087
00:59:58,649 --> 00:59:59,430
Yeah, I know, I know

1088
00:59:59,455 --> 01:00:00,653
-that the bankers can change 
-Which, which

1089
01:00:00,678 --> 01:00:03,302
their mind, it's-and I know
what is at stake.

1090
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:04,582
You know,

1091
01:00:04,729 --> 01:00:08,441
the only couple I knew that
both Kennedy and LBJ

1092
01:00:08,489 --> 01:00:11,409
wanted to socialize with
was you and your husband.

1093
01:00:11,434 --> 01:00:13,394
And you own the damn paper.

1094
01:00:15,072 --> 01:00:16,697
It's just the way things worked.

1095
01:00:16,885 --> 01:00:18,900
Politicians and the press,
they trusted each other

1096
01:00:18,933 --> 01:00:21,658
so they could go to the same
dinner party and drink cocktails

1097
01:00:21,683 --> 01:00:23,580
and tell jokes
while there was a war

1098
01:00:23,605 --> 01:00:25,002
-raging in Vietnam.
-Ben, I don't know what

1099
01:00:25,027 --> 01:00:26,080
what we're talking about.

1100
01:00:26,112 --> 01:00:27,701
I'm not protecting Lyndon.

1101
01:00:27,726 --> 01:00:29,577
No, you got his former
Secretary of Defense

1102
01:00:29,602 --> 01:00:32,142
Robert McNamara,
the man who commissioned

1103
01:00:32,167 --> 01:00:33,986
-this study--he's one of about
-I'm not protecting him.

1104
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:35,345
-a dozen party guests
-I'm not protecting

1105
01:00:35,370 --> 01:00:36,468
-out on your patio.
-any of them. I'm

1106
01:00:36,493 --> 01:00:37,906
protecting the paper.

1107
01:00:37,953 --> 01:00:40,820
Yeah, well, I wasn't a
stooge for Jack Kennedy.

1108
01:00:41,953 --> 01:00:44,390
The night he was assassinated,
Tony and I were down

1109
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:47,320
at the Naval Hospital
so we would be there,

1110
01:00:47,398 --> 01:00:49,149
meet Jackie when she landed.

1111
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:52,539
She was bringing Jack's body
back on the plane from Dallas

1112
01:00:52,564 --> 01:00:54,579
and she walked into the room.

1113
01:00:54,947 --> 01:00:56,993
She was still wearing
that pink suit

1114
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,837
with Jack's blood all over.

1115
01:00:59,603 --> 01:01:02,508
She fell into Tony's arms
and they held each other for

1116
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:05,017
quite a long time and...

1117
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:10,736
And then Jackie looked at me
and said, "None of this--

1118
01:01:10,877 --> 01:01:13,048
"none of what you see,
none of what I say

1119
01:01:13,089 --> 01:01:16,510
"is ever going to be
in your newspaper, Ben."

1120
01:01:17,535 --> 01:01:20,285
And that just about broke
my heart, I, uh...

1121
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,175
I never...

1122
01:01:22,355 --> 01:01:24,222
I never thought of
Jack as a source.

1123
01:01:24,247 --> 01:01:26,106
I thought of him as a friend. And--

1124
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:28,005
And that was my mistake.

1125
01:01:29,003 --> 01:01:31,363
And it was something that
Jack knew all along.

1126
01:01:32,644 --> 01:01:34,706
We can't be both,
we have to choose.

1127
01:01:35,813 --> 01:01:36,720
And uh...

1128
01:01:37,368 --> 01:01:38,688
And that's the point.

1129
01:01:39,116 --> 01:01:40,897
The days of us smoking
cigars together

1130
01:01:40,922 --> 01:01:42,991
down on Pennsylvania Avenue
were over.

1131
01:01:43,788 --> 01:01:45,764
Your friend McNamara's study

1132
01:01:46,663 --> 01:01:47,679
proves that.

1133
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:50,043
The way they lied.

1134
01:01:52,317 --> 01:01:53,746
The way they lied.

1135
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,004
Those days have to be over.

1136
01:01:58,361 --> 01:01:59,971
We have to be the check

1137
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:01,439
on their power.

1138
01:02:01,525 --> 01:02:03,439
If we don't hold
them accountable,

1139
01:02:03,518 --> 01:02:05,791
then, my God, who will?

1140
01:02:07,555 --> 01:02:09,117
Well, I've never
smoked a cigar.

1141
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:11,711
And I have no problem
holding Lyndon or Jack or

1142
01:02:11,782 --> 01:02:13,649
Bob or any of them accountable.

1143
01:02:14,424 --> 01:02:16,431
We can't hold them accountable

1144
01:02:16,548 --> 01:02:18,165
if we don't have a newspaper.

1145
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:22,667
When I get my hands
on that study,

1146
01:02:22,753 --> 01:02:25,534
what are you going to do,
Mrs. Graham?

1147
01:02:28,838 --> 01:02:30,244
Oh, um...

1148
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,041
Happy birthday, by the way.

1149
01:02:34,912 --> 01:02:36,123
Oh, that's not what I heard.

1150
01:02:45,098 --> 01:02:46,739
-Club soda.
-Yes, thank you.

1151
01:02:48,247 --> 01:02:49,083
Sir,

1152
01:02:49,192 --> 01:02:51,324
I'm gonna need to put your seat
in a full upright position

1153
01:02:51,349 --> 01:02:53,215
-before take-off.
-Oh, yeah.

1154
01:02:53,856 --> 01:02:55,919
Oh, must be precious cargo.

1155
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:59,219
Yeah...it's just...
government secrets.

1156
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:00,212
Oh.

1157
01:03:00,454 --> 01:03:01,734
Please fasten you seatbelt.

1158
01:03:16,127 --> 01:03:18,221
-You know why we're here?
-Beats me.

1159
01:03:19,192 --> 01:03:20,926
-Hi, Marina.
-Hi.

1160
01:03:20,971 --> 01:03:23,018
-Do you want lemonade?
-A little early for me.

1161
01:03:23,043 --> 01:03:24,744
Ah, loosen up, I'm buying.

1162
01:03:24,769 --> 01:03:26,775
What kind of lemonade 
you have there?

1163
01:03:26,902 --> 01:03:29,909
Uh, it's the one
with the lemons in it.

1164
01:03:30,331 --> 01:03:31,331
Okay.

1165
01:03:32,585 --> 01:03:33,475
There you go.

1166
01:03:36,137 --> 01:03:37,411
Bill, help me out.

1167
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:41,317
Grab my briefcase.

1168
01:03:43,771 --> 01:03:45,199
-Is that...?
-Yup.

1169
01:03:58,202 --> 01:04:01,515
It's not the full report,
but it's over 4,000 pages of it.

1170
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:05,970
Huh, are these in order?

1171
01:04:05,995 --> 01:04:07,190
I don't think so.

1172
01:04:07,237 --> 01:04:08,495
There are no page numbers.

1173
01:04:08,549 --> 01:04:10,439
Yeah, that's where the
top secret stamps were.

1174
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:11,689
My source had to cut 'em off.

1175
01:04:11,714 --> 01:04:13,323
We're supposed
to retire on Friday.

1176
01:04:13,362 --> 01:04:16,010
Ben, how are we supposed to
comb through 4,000 pages--

1177
01:04:16,035 --> 01:04:17,463
They're not even
loosely organized.

1178
01:04:17,488 --> 01:04:18,550
The Times had three months.

1179
01:04:18,582 --> 01:04:19,691
There's no way we
get this amount...

1180
01:04:19,716 --> 01:04:21,316
Yeah, he's right,
we got less than eight hours.

1181
01:04:21,371 --> 01:04:22,902
We get two per city,
then we have ten.

1182
01:04:22,996 --> 01:04:25,855
Hey, hey, hey, for the last six
years we've been playing catch up.

1183
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:28,012
And now thanks to the President
of the United States

1184
01:04:28,037 --> 01:04:31,589
who, by the way, is taking a shit
all over the First Amendment,

1185
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:33,043
we have the goods.

1186
01:04:33,434 --> 01:04:35,129
We don't have any competition.

1187
01:04:35,656 --> 01:04:37,547
There's dozens of
stories in here.

1188
01:04:37,633 --> 01:04:40,023
The Times has barely
scratched the surface.

1189
01:04:40,648 --> 01:04:43,187
We have ten hours till
the deadline, so,

1190
01:04:44,062 --> 01:04:45,476
we dig in.

1191
01:04:49,547 --> 01:04:51,469
I think this memo's
from McNamara.

1192
01:04:51,695 --> 01:04:53,304
Uh "It is my belief
that there should be

1193
01:04:53,329 --> 01:04:55,117
a three or four week
pause in bombing--"

1194
01:04:55,142 --> 01:04:57,241
Wait, wait, wait, I saw the
other half of that memo.

1195
01:04:57,266 --> 01:05:00,609
Uh, anyone have the back half
of a cable from Dulles in '54?

1196
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,664
I thought I saw one from July.

1197
01:05:02,711 --> 01:05:04,891
Yeah, here it is, uh, "The
reasons for this belief

1198
01:05:04,954 --> 01:05:06,868
"are that we must
lay a foundation

1199
01:05:06,893 --> 01:05:08,117
"in the mind of the
American public."

1200
01:05:08,142 --> 01:05:09,961
Th-Th-Th-That's it!
Mm-hmm.

1201
01:05:11,542 --> 01:05:13,128
So Johnson wasn't
trying to make peace,

1202
01:05:13,153 --> 01:05:14,464
he was just manipulating
the public?

1203
01:05:14,489 --> 01:05:17,199
Eyes out for a suspension
in bombing from when?

1204
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:19,051
'65 to '68.

1205
01:05:19,076 --> 01:05:21,348
What about a memo
from Eisenhower's

1206
01:05:21,373 --> 01:05:22,966
special committee in Indochina?

1207
01:05:23,028 --> 01:05:25,378
Uh, Meg read a
part of one to me.

1208
01:05:25,409 --> 01:05:27,269
-Meg?
-Anybody see a mention

1209
01:05:27,294 --> 01:05:29,394
-of the Rand Vietcong study?
-Yeah, I think this might be

1210
01:05:29,419 --> 01:05:32,417
from your Rand study,
"VC are deeply committed."

1211
01:05:32,442 --> 01:05:34,505
"South Vietnam is a lost cause."

1212
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,505
Whoa! There you go!

1213
01:05:36,545 --> 01:05:38,684
-Meg, Meg, Meg, I need the uh...
-I put it on the shelf.

1214
01:05:38,709 --> 01:05:39,834
A couple of piles.

1215
01:05:40,057 --> 01:05:41,213
We're gettin' somewhere.

1216
01:05:41,268 --> 01:05:44,495
All right, it's 1:30, at
4:00 story conference.

1217
01:05:44,593 --> 01:05:46,804
Can I interest anyone
in some lemonade?

1218
01:05:46,829 --> 01:05:48,312
Does it have vodka in it?

1219
01:05:48,374 --> 01:05:49,446
-I don't, I don't
-Hey,

1220
01:05:49,471 --> 01:05:50,876
-put vodka in my lemonade.
-go easy on the kid.

1221
01:05:50,901 --> 01:05:51,721
Why not?

1222
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,364
-How much, sweetheart?
-A quarter.

1223
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:54,567
It's fifty cents.

1224
01:05:55,263 --> 01:05:56,958
-Inflation.
-It's going up!

1225
01:06:00,425 --> 01:06:02,675
Mr. Bradlee. Roger Clark.

1226
01:06:02,909 --> 01:06:05,113
Oh, you're Roger Clark.

1227
01:06:05,316 --> 01:06:06,917
Nice to meet you in person.

1228
01:06:07,058 --> 01:06:10,113
You...you are our
senior legal counsel.

1229
01:06:10,834 --> 01:06:12,732
Yes, we've-we've
spoken on the phone.

1230
01:06:12,772 --> 01:06:14,545
My voice should sound familiar.

1231
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:16,131
When did you finish law school?

1232
01:06:17,491 --> 01:06:19,163
-I graduated--
-Rhetorical question.

1233
01:06:19,328 --> 01:06:20,070
-You know,
-Yes.

1234
01:06:20,095 --> 01:06:23,304
the guy we had before you
is now Secretary of State?

1235
01:06:23,718 --> 01:06:25,328
I did not know that.

1236
01:06:26,554 --> 01:06:28,429
A little joke, perhaps
not the time--

1237
01:06:28,454 --> 01:06:29,992
What exactly can
I help you with?

1238
01:06:30,241 --> 01:06:33,038
So, why would the CIA director
send a memo on work orders?

1239
01:06:33,085 --> 01:06:34,570
'Cause they weren't
calling it a war yet.

1240
01:06:34,602 --> 01:06:36,397
Okay, I've got
turkey with mustard,

1241
01:06:36,422 --> 01:06:38,293
-roast beef with horseradish.
-Oh, I'll take it.

1242
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:39,301
Howard, come look at this.

1243
01:06:39,326 --> 01:06:40,875
-Chal, you've gotta see this--
-Take a napkin.

1244
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,926
it's a full analysis of McNamara's
changing view of the war.

1245
01:06:43,973 --> 01:06:45,051
Does it say anything
about why...?

1246
01:06:45,076 --> 01:06:46,747
So, we knew they were
gonna assassinate Diem.

1247
01:06:46,772 --> 01:06:48,465
Yeah, and they did
nothing to stop it.

1248
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:50,309
I think I got something on
McNamara on the fireplace--

1249
01:06:50,353 --> 01:06:51,400
the other fireplace.

1250
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:55,162
Murray, where's the
back half of this one?

1251
01:06:57,655 --> 01:06:59,381
Tell me these aren't the
classified documents

1252
01:06:59,428 --> 01:07:00,921
 from the McNamara study.

1253
01:07:01,382 --> 01:07:03,702
-4,000 pages of it.
-Hungry?

1254
01:07:04,066 --> 01:07:05,183
I need to use a phone.

1255
01:07:05,573 --> 01:07:07,449
There's uh, one in the other room.

1256
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:10,680
-Is that it?
-This is it, this is it.

1257
01:07:12,134 --> 01:07:13,352
This is gonna happen.

1258
01:07:54,975 --> 01:07:58,061
Hi, thanks for
letting me drop by.

1259
01:07:58,428 --> 01:08:01,047
-Marg still napping?
-Yeah, yeah.

1260
01:08:01,102 --> 01:08:02,430
Do you mind if we
talk in the center?

1261
01:08:02,485 --> 01:08:04,063
-Just so I can hear her.
-No, no

1262
01:08:04,126 --> 01:08:05,219
-She wakes...
-Of course not.

1263
01:08:05,244 --> 01:08:06,563
I can't stay long, I've got a

1264
01:08:06,588 --> 01:08:08,008
-big event at the house later.
-I guess you've

1265
01:08:08,048 --> 01:08:09,829
read everything now.

1266
01:08:11,178 --> 01:08:12,975
Yes, I have, I have. Yes.

1267
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,116
And I went over it
again this morning.

1268
01:08:15,632 --> 01:08:16,640
All of it.

1269
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:19,468
And I just...

1270
01:08:21,474 --> 01:08:23,192
Forgive me, Bob, I...

1271
01:08:23,364 --> 01:08:25,903
know you're dealing
with so much, but

1272
01:08:26,244 --> 01:08:29,181
but it's just, it's so hard to, um,

1273
01:08:29,604 --> 01:08:31,291
try to make sense of why

1274
01:08:31,494 --> 01:08:34,026
of how you could
have done all these things.

1275
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:36,241
How you could
just lie to us all.

1276
01:08:36,281 --> 01:08:37,749
Well... i-it's easy

1277
01:08:37,804 --> 01:08:40,031
for the papers to
characterize us

1278
01:08:40,093 --> 01:08:42,530
as liars, we were just
trying to push back--

1279
01:08:42,582 --> 01:08:44,902
Yeah, but you let it go on,
and on, and--

1280
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,723
My son is home now
and safe--Thank God.

1281
01:08:47,952 --> 01:08:49,608
But you watched him go.

1282
01:08:49,921 --> 01:08:51,725
You knew we couldn't
win over there

1283
01:08:51,788 --> 01:08:55,186
for years and years and years,
and yet you let me...

1284
01:08:55,812 --> 01:08:58,944
You let so many of our
friends send our boys off...

1285
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:00,819
Kay, we were doing
the best we could.

1286
01:09:01,858 --> 01:09:04,437
It was domino theory,
containment.

1287
01:09:04,905 --> 01:09:07,381
And eventually, we felt that
military pressure

1288
01:09:07,413 --> 01:09:10,405
was the only thing that was gonna
drive Ho Chi Minh to the table.

1289
01:09:10,488 --> 01:09:12,199
Our decision-making
process was--

1290
01:09:12,253 --> 01:09:13,378
"Flawed."

1291
01:09:18,714 --> 01:09:21,495
It was flawed. That's
what your study said.

1292
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:24,465
Yes.

1293
01:09:27,286 --> 01:09:28,426
I do believe

1294
01:09:28,451 --> 01:09:31,888
that you were trying
to do your best.

1295
01:09:33,008 --> 01:09:35,524
And I know how
difficult it can be

1296
01:09:35,641 --> 01:09:37,493
to make choices that will...

1297
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:38,782
That's kind of you.

1298
01:09:40,469 --> 01:09:43,524
Oh, well, what comes next
might not be so kind.

1299
01:09:46,172 --> 01:09:47,641
You have the papers?

1300
01:09:48,129 --> 01:09:49,043
Oh.

1301
01:09:49,973 --> 01:09:51,167
Let's just say

1302
01:09:51,481 --> 01:09:53,012
I may have

1303
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:55,262
a big decision to make.

1304
01:10:00,256 --> 01:10:02,990
They will argue it's a violation
of the Espionage Act.

1305
01:10:03,038 --> 01:10:04,491
That is a felony, Ben.

1306
01:10:04,516 --> 01:10:06,070
That's only-only if the
documents we print

1307
01:10:06,095 --> 01:10:07,696
could damage the United States.

1308
01:10:07,781 --> 01:10:09,250
There's a federal
judge in New York

1309
01:10:09,275 --> 01:10:10,633
who seems to think
that they could.

1310
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:12,797
Well, I've got six seasoned
journalists in the next room

1311
01:10:12,822 --> 01:10:14,828
who've been reporting on this
war for the last ten years.

1312
01:10:14,853 --> 01:10:16,891
And I'll lay odds that
they have a better idea

1313
01:10:16,916 --> 01:10:18,549
of what could damage
the United States

1314
01:10:18,611 --> 01:10:20,502
than some judge
who is just now

1315
01:10:20,527 --> 01:10:22,698
wading in this territory
for the first time.

1316
01:10:22,723 --> 01:10:25,350
"Wading", is that a metaphor
for Vietnam?

1317
01:10:25,375 --> 01:10:27,959
Okay, Ben, look, we know
your reporters are talented.

1318
01:10:28,132 --> 01:10:30,171
But The New York Times
spent three months

1319
01:10:30,196 --> 01:10:32,038
going over these documents.

1320
01:10:32,364 --> 01:10:35,372
You've got what--seven hours now
until the paper goes to press?

1321
01:10:35,489 --> 01:10:37,934
Can you honestly tell me
that that is enough time

1322
01:10:37,981 --> 01:10:40,574
to make sure not a single

1323
01:10:40,872 --> 01:10:43,098
military plan, not a single
U.S. soldier,

1324
01:10:43,123 --> 01:10:45,970
not a single American life
will be put in harm's way,

1325
01:10:45,995 --> 01:10:49,416
that this will do no damage to the
United States if you publish?

1326
01:10:49,681 --> 01:10:50,805
Yes.

1327
01:10:53,016 --> 01:10:54,282
You're sure about that?

1328
01:10:54,360 --> 01:10:57,142
No!
That's why I called you guys.

1329
01:10:58,779 --> 01:11:01,224
Look, Kay, I know why
The Times ran the story.

1330
01:11:01,249 --> 01:11:02,764
But you need to understand,

1331
01:11:02,803 --> 01:11:05,880
the study was for posterity.
It was written for academics

1332
01:11:05,904 --> 01:11:08,076
in the future and right now, we're
still in the middle of the war.

1333
01:11:08,149 --> 01:11:09,960
The papers can't be objective.

1334
01:11:10,015 --> 01:11:12,382
I suppose the public
has a right to know.

1335
01:11:12,407 --> 01:11:13,850
But I would prefer

1336
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:16,123
that the study not be
made widely available

1337
01:11:16,164 --> 01:11:18,405
until it can be read
with some perspective.

1338
01:11:18,455 --> 01:11:20,354
-You understand.
-Mm.

1339
01:11:23,691 --> 01:11:25,566
We've been through
a lot, haven't we?

1340
01:11:26,042 --> 01:11:27,246
You and Marg.

1341
01:11:27,742 --> 01:11:29,000
You were there for me.

1342
01:11:29,398 --> 01:11:31,492
At the lowest point of my life.

1343
01:11:31,740 --> 01:11:32,904
You helped me.

1344
01:11:33,037 --> 01:11:35,178
You've selected
my entire board.

1345
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:37,443
You're my most trusted advisor.

1346
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:39,397
My dear friend.

1347
01:11:40,544 --> 01:11:42,185
But my feelings

1348
01:11:42,567 --> 01:11:44,612
about that
and about you can't

1349
01:11:44,637 --> 01:11:47,729
uh, be part of this
decision to publish or not.

1350
01:11:47,816 --> 01:11:50,261
I'm here asking

1351
01:11:50,808 --> 01:11:53,910
your advice, Bob,
not your permission.

1352
01:11:55,254 --> 01:11:56,051
Well,

1353
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,104
then as one of your
most trusted advisors,

1354
01:11:58,129 --> 01:12:00,299
and someone who knows how much
you care about this company,

1355
01:12:00,324 --> 01:12:01,472
I'm worried, Kay.

1356
01:12:01,524 --> 01:12:03,000
You know, I worked in
Washington for ten years

1357
01:12:03,062 --> 01:12:04,476
I've seen these people
up close.

1358
01:12:04,524 --> 01:12:06,532
Bobby and Lyndon,
they were tough customers.

1359
01:12:06,557 --> 01:12:08,946
But Nixon is different.

1360
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:10,962
He's got some real bad
people around him.

1361
01:12:10,987 --> 01:12:13,072
And if you publish, he'll
get the very worst of them

1362
01:12:13,127 --> 01:12:15,790
the Colsons, and the Ehrlichmans
and he'll crush you.

1363
01:12:15,815 --> 01:12:17,268
I know, he's just awful, but I--

1364
01:12:17,307 --> 01:12:19,018
He's a--Nixon's a son of a bitch!

1365
01:12:19,043 --> 01:12:20,800
He hates you, he hates Ben.

1366
01:12:20,825 --> 01:12:22,238
He's wanted to ruin
the paper for years.

1367
01:12:22,263 --> 01:12:24,801
And you will not get
a second chance, Kay.

1368
01:12:25,023 --> 01:12:26,453
The Richard Nixon I know

1369
01:12:26,478 --> 01:12:28,430
will muster the full
power of the presidency.

1370
01:12:28,455 --> 01:12:30,313
And if there's a way
to destroy your paper,

1371
01:12:30,414 --> 01:12:32,313
by God, he'll find it!

1372
01:12:35,247 --> 01:12:37,137
-Publish information that harms
-I told you

1373
01:12:37,239 --> 01:12:38,762
-national security.
-there' nothing in there.

1374
01:12:38,825 --> 01:12:40,731
If there is, the paper
will be prosecuted.

1375
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:41,903
Isn't that why you're here?

1376
01:12:42,256 --> 01:12:43,748
Yes, Ben, but if we lose--

1377
01:12:43,773 --> 01:12:45,587
Oh, with what we pay you,
you really shouldn't lose.

1378
01:12:45,612 --> 01:12:46,641
Ben, you need
to listen to them.

1379
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:48,071
Hey, Fritz, good to see you.

1380
01:12:48,103 --> 01:12:49,345
This is about the
future of the company.

1381
01:12:49,408 --> 01:12:50,946
-and ensuring there is one.
-Oh, that's a little melodramatic,

1382
01:12:50,971 --> 01:12:52,369
-don't you think?
-Melodramatic.

1383
01:12:52,571 --> 01:12:56,305
You're talking about exposing
years of government secrets.

1384
01:12:56,815 --> 01:12:58,932
I can't imagine they're
gonna take that lightly.

1385
01:12:59,555 --> 01:13:01,180
You could jeopardize
the public offering.

1386
01:13:01,205 --> 01:13:03,281
You could jeopardize our
television stations.

1387
01:13:03,352 --> 01:13:05,102
You know a felon can't
hold a broadcast license.

1388
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:07,205
You think I give two shits
about the television stations?

1389
01:13:07,230 --> 01:13:09,174
You should, they make a hell of
a lot more money than you do.

1390
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:11,738
And without that revenue,
we'd be forced to sell.

1391
01:13:11,872 --> 01:13:14,145
If the government wins
and we're convicted,

1392
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:17,089
the Washington Post as we
know it will cease to exist.

1393
01:13:17,114 --> 01:13:18,309
Well, if we live in-
in a world where

1394
01:13:18,334 --> 01:13:20,160
the government could tell us
what we can and cannot print,

1395
01:13:20,185 --> 01:13:21,356
then the Washington Post
as we know it

1396
01:13:21,381 --> 01:13:23,278
has already ceased to exist.

1397
01:13:25,117 --> 01:13:26,352
What if we wait?

1398
01:13:27,883 --> 01:13:30,086
What if we hold off
on printing today?

1399
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:31,570
And instead we call
the Attorney General

1400
01:13:31,595 --> 01:13:34,884
and we tell him that we
intend to print on Sunday.

1401
01:13:34,909 --> 01:13:37,166
That way, we give them and
us time to figure out

1402
01:13:37,191 --> 01:13:38,753
 the legality of all of it,

1403
01:13:39,034 --> 01:13:41,550
while the court in New York
decides The Times case.

1404
01:13:41,693 --> 01:13:43,911
You're suggesting we alert
the Attorney General

1405
01:13:43,936 --> 01:13:46,107
to the fact that we
have these documents

1406
01:13:46,164 --> 01:13:47,500
that we're going to print

1407
01:13:47,696 --> 01:13:49,086
in a few days.

1408
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:55,431
Well, yes, that is the...idea.

1409
01:13:56,026 --> 01:13:57,127
Yeah, well,

1410
01:13:57,401 --> 01:14:00,291
outside of landing the
Hindenburg in a lightning storm,

1411
01:14:00,322 --> 01:14:02,510
that's about the shittiest
idea I've ever heard.

1412
01:14:02,535 --> 01:14:03,651
Oh, boy.

1413
01:14:11,521 --> 01:14:13,513
Oh, here's the man of the hour.

1414
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:17,551
Ah, I'm found.

1415
01:14:17,576 --> 01:14:20,232
Thank you, Kay, you didn't have
to got through all this trouble.

1416
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:22,489
We had to turn him away
at the door, didn't we, dear.

1417
01:14:22,856 --> 01:14:25,676
-Oh, Gene.
-Mrs. Graham.

1418
01:14:25,922 --> 01:14:28,047
So, everything okay?

1419
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:30,680
Uh, it's gotten pretty
hot over at Ben's house.

1420
01:14:31,068 --> 01:14:33,810
Oh, things are not going well?

1421
01:14:33,835 --> 01:14:36,825
No, Ben and Mr. Beebe
are real loggerheads.

1422
01:14:37,569 --> 01:14:39,757
Fritz and Ben on opposite sides?

1423
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,764
I made a commitment
to publish these papers.

1424
01:14:41,862 --> 01:14:44,549
Yes, and if you would tell us who
you made that commitment to...

1425
01:14:46,267 --> 01:14:48,850
-Enjoying the fight?
-Yeah, who's winning?

1426
01:14:48,906 --> 01:14:49,789
Nixon.

1427
01:14:49,906 --> 01:14:51,094
I didn't see him come in.

1428
01:14:51,164 --> 01:14:54,015
Really? He's got his hand
so far up Fritz' ass.

1429
01:14:55,226 --> 01:14:56,570
Where is Fritz?

1430
01:15:00,922 --> 01:15:01,696
That--

1431
01:15:01,805 --> 01:15:04,612
That--not in so many words, but
you're a bunch of lawyers.

1432
01:15:05,227 --> 01:15:06,594
If we're not gonna publish,

1433
01:15:06,619 --> 01:15:08,493
why are we busting
our rear ends, Ben?

1434
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,172
Keep writing.

1435
01:15:10,265 --> 01:15:11,687
And uh, what, could--

1436
01:15:11,781 --> 01:15:13,945
Could you stop
playing chopsticks?

1437
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:20,644
What's up there, Fritz?

1438
01:15:21,363 --> 01:15:22,456
Calling Kay.

1439
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:24,973
I'm sorry, Ben.

1440
01:15:25,207 --> 01:15:26,441
I know you want this.

1441
01:15:26,785 --> 01:15:28,285
There'll be another one.

1442
01:15:29,435 --> 01:15:31,599
Like hell there will be.

1443
01:15:39,995 --> 01:15:42,518
<i>Uh, hello, hello, I'm
making a telephone call.</i>

1444
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:44,238
Yeah, well, it's my house

1445
01:15:44,277 --> 01:15:46,651
-so I-I'll be on the call.
<i>-All right, Ben.</i>

1446
01:15:46,967 --> 01:15:49,263
I just want to-
to thank you all

1447
01:15:49,288 --> 01:15:51,428
for coming out this evening

1448
01:15:51,573 --> 01:15:55,315
to help me launch
Harry Gladstein and his

1449
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:59,728
new sailboat into the...
Chesapeake Bay.

1450
01:15:59,753 --> 01:16:04,250
And into his very
well-earned retirement.

1451
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,110
Let me just tell
you a little bit

1452
01:16:06,135 --> 01:16:08,189
about why I'm so
wild about Harry.

1453
01:16:09,278 --> 01:16:11,888
Mrs. Graham, it's
Mr. Beebe on the phone.

1454
01:16:11,973 --> 01:16:14,754
In uh, 1949, wasn't it?

1455
01:16:14,817 --> 01:16:18,543
Uh, Phil Graham first brought
Harry to the company.

1456
01:16:18,581 --> 01:16:20,753
-I'm afraid they need you now
-And I remember he told me.

1457
01:16:20,778 --> 01:16:22,204
Mrs. Graham.

1458
01:16:23,224 --> 01:16:24,740
They're now--

1459
01:16:26,287 --> 01:16:29,225
Uh, oh, dear.
I'm so sorry.

1460
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:31,459
Forgive me, Harry.

1461
01:16:31,624 --> 01:16:33,288
I think I'll have to suspend.

1462
01:16:33,975 --> 01:16:35,874
Well, you're paying
the overtime.

1463
01:16:37,436 --> 01:16:38,662
Be right back.

1464
01:16:42,136 --> 01:16:43,043
We should wait.

1465
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:46,725
Yeah, I understand, Ben,
but if you wait a day...

1466
01:16:48,423 --> 01:16:49,907
Fritz on the phone for me?

1467
01:16:49,932 --> 01:16:51,079
We should be on this call.

1468
01:16:51,138 --> 01:16:53,474
Well, there's an extension
in the living room.

1469
01:16:53,576 --> 01:16:55,740
Liz, show them where,
please, thank you.

1470
01:17:06,579 --> 01:17:08,688
-Hello, Fritz?
-Hello, Kay.

1471
01:17:09,126 --> 01:17:10,438
Would you like me
to catch you up?

1472
01:17:10,463 --> 01:17:12,798
I say we can, he says we can't.
There, you're caught up.

1473
01:17:12,823 --> 01:17:14,205
<i>-Ben?
-Hello, it's Art.</i>

1474
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:17,413
<i>Uh, Ben, there are concerns here</i>

1475
01:17:17,438 --> 01:17:19,327
<i>that are frankly above
your pay grade.</i>

1476
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:20,772
<i>Well, there's a few above yours.</i>

1477
01:17:20,797 --> 01:17:22,359
<i>Like fucking freedom
of the press.</i>

1478
01:17:22,476 --> 01:17:24,398
Let's just be civil if we can.

1479
01:17:24,484 --> 01:17:26,156
<i>Do you think Nixon is
going to be civil?</i>

1480
01:17:26,304 --> 01:17:28,883
He is trying to censor the
goddamn New York Times.

1481
01:17:28,908 --> 01:17:30,655
Yes, The Times, not The Post.

1482
01:17:30,702 --> 01:17:32,258
<i>It's the same damn thing!</i>

1483
01:17:32,283 --> 01:17:35,913
<i>This is an historic fight.
If they lose, we lose.</i>

1484
01:17:36,458 --> 01:17:38,146
<i>Hello, is someone on the phone?</i>

1485
01:17:38,357 --> 01:17:39,396
<i>This is Phil.</i>

1486
01:17:39,474 --> 01:17:41,115
Is that Phil Geyelin?

1487
01:17:41,216 --> 01:17:43,482
<i>Uh, yes, Mrs. Graham.</i>

1488
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:45,749
Good, I'd like you to
weigh in if you would.

1489
01:17:45,835 --> 01:17:49,261
because I-I want to know what
staff is feeling about this.

1490
01:17:49,543 --> 01:17:52,269
<i>Uh, well, frankly, Mrs. Graham,</i>

1491
01:17:52,294 --> 01:17:56,528
<i>Ben Bagdikian and Chal Roberts
have uh, both threatened to resign.</i>

1492
01:17:56,688 --> 01:17:59,149
<i>If we don't publish, that is.</i>

1493
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:00,517
Come on, Kay,
what do you expect?

1494
01:18:00,542 --> 01:18:01,565
<i>You've got nothing to lose.</i>

1495
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:02,515
<i>Due respect, we all</i>

1496
01:18:02,546 --> 01:18:04,569
have everything to lose
if we don't publish

1497
01:18:04,594 --> 01:18:07,106
What will happen to the
reputation of this paper?

1498
01:18:07,351 --> 01:18:09,594
Everyone will find out
we had the study.

1499
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:11,500
<i>Hell, I bet half the
town knows already.</i>

1500
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:13,914
<i>What will it look like
if we sit on our asses?</i>

1501
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:15,328
It'll look like we were prudent.

1502
01:18:15,375 --> 01:18:16,985
<i>It will look like
we were afraid.</i>

1503
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:19,985
We will lose. The country will lose.
Nixon wins.

1504
01:18:20,153 --> 01:18:21,941
Nixon wins this one,
and the next one.

1505
01:18:21,981 --> 01:18:23,973
And all the ones after that
because we were scared.

1506
01:18:24,012 --> 01:18:27,480
Because the only way to assert
the right to publish is to publish.

1507
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:35,300
Fritz, i-is Fritz-Fritz there?

1508
01:18:37,332 --> 01:18:38,800
Fritz are you on?

1509
01:18:39,855 --> 01:18:41,206
<i>I'm here, Kay.</i>

1510
01:18:44,685 --> 01:18:46,349
W-What do you think?

1511
01:18:48,357 --> 01:18:50,467
W-What do you think I should do?

1512
01:18:53,528 --> 01:18:54,700
<i>I think...</i>

1513
01:18:55,465 --> 01:18:58,028
<i>there are arguments
on both sides.</i>

1514
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,699
But I guess I wouldn't publish.

1515
01:19:26,978 --> 01:19:28,384
Let's-Let's go.

1516
01:19:28,525 --> 01:19:29,525
Let's-Let's do it.

1517
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:30,259
Let's-Let's--

1518
01:19:30,338 --> 01:19:31,704
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Let's--

1519
01:19:31,775 --> 01:19:33,181
Let's publish.

1520
01:19:37,641 --> 01:19:38,828
-What?
-Phil?

1521
01:19:38,954 --> 01:19:40,157
-What?
-What'd she say?

1522
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:42,742
We go.

1523
01:19:45,047 --> 01:19:47,273
She says we publish.

1524
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:49,304
-Hot damn.
-My God.

1525
01:19:49,391 --> 01:19:51,006
-Holy shit.
-Let's get this out.

1526
01:19:51,194 --> 01:19:52,327
Holy shit.

1527
01:19:53,073 --> 01:19:54,362
-I need that, Meg.
-Oh, sorry.

1528
01:19:54,703 --> 01:19:55,597
W-W-Wait,

1529
01:19:55,622 --> 01:19:56,723
-I need the notes.
-Sorry, sorry.

1530
01:19:56,817 --> 01:19:58,169
We got uh,

1531
01:19:58,498 --> 01:19:59,498
two hours to get it to the...

1532
01:19:59,826 --> 01:20:01,037
I got it, hold on.

1533
01:20:04,495 --> 01:20:06,308
-W-W-Wait, who' takin' it?
-I got it.

1534
01:20:06,402 --> 01:20:09,449
All right, call uh national desk,
tell 'em Bagdikian's coming with us.

1535
01:20:09,550 --> 01:20:10,558
Done!

1536
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:12,720
All right, get it in the paper.

1537
01:20:12,775 --> 01:20:13,955
Editorial meeting.

1538
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,688
-Ben.
-Yes.

1539
01:20:25,513 --> 01:20:27,068
-That it?
-That's it.

1540
01:20:38,092 --> 01:20:39,904
You, you got half an hour.

1541
01:20:51,194 --> 01:20:54,023
I'm uh, I'm not sure
how much thought

1542
01:20:54,426 --> 01:20:56,591
you put into this decision,
but we still have time.

1543
01:20:56,616 --> 01:20:58,404
The print deadline's
not till midnight.

1544
01:20:58,466 --> 01:21:00,604
I know when
the print deadline is.

1545
01:21:00,666 --> 01:21:02,729
Look, I'm still, uh,
learning how to do this,

1546
01:21:02,754 --> 01:21:04,346
but everything I know
about business tells me

1547
01:21:04,378 --> 01:21:06,706
you're making a
serious mistake here.

1548
01:21:06,754 --> 01:21:08,355
One that will cost you
and your paper dearly.

1549
01:21:08,380 --> 01:21:10,301
And hurt every person
gathered here,

1550
01:21:10,326 --> 01:21:13,036
not to mention the hundreds
of others who work for you.

1551
01:21:13,107 --> 01:21:15,176
I'm just trying to put
my thoughts together.

1552
01:21:15,239 --> 01:21:18,965
Kay, all I want is-is what is
best for you and your business.

1553
01:21:19,771 --> 01:21:22,427
But I just got off the phone
with a couple of bankers,

1554
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:25,872
and they think it's
possible, likely even,

1555
01:21:26,059 --> 01:21:29,075
that a number of their institutional
investors will pull out

1556
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:32,088
if you go ahead and publish,
and if they pull out...

1557
01:21:32,634 --> 01:21:33,509
Kay.

1558
01:21:35,072 --> 01:21:36,791
You got a couple of hours.

1559
01:21:37,744 --> 01:21:38,767
For your sake

1560
01:21:38,792 --> 01:21:41,150
and for the sake of
everyone of your employees,

1561
01:21:41,182 --> 01:21:43,330
I hope you will reconsider.

1562
01:21:50,482 --> 01:21:51,638
Give me a canister.

1563
01:21:57,636 --> 01:21:59,762
Get it downstairs, and
I want the page editor

1564
01:21:59,787 --> 01:22:02,066
standin' over lino till
they got it ready to print.

1565
01:22:02,091 --> 01:22:02,832
Okay.

1566
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:08,330
Mr. Bagdikian.

1567
01:22:14,057 --> 01:22:15,666
I need to know your source.

1568
01:22:16,547 --> 01:22:18,242
I thought I was clear earlier.

1569
01:22:19,303 --> 01:22:21,545
Well, we weren't
going to press earlier.

1570
01:22:21,576 --> 01:22:23,342
Yeah, well, my
answer's the same.

1571
01:22:24,335 --> 01:22:27,100
"This action has been commenced
to enjoin The New York Times

1572
01:22:27,133 --> 01:22:29,538
"and their agents from further
disseminating or disclosing

1573
01:22:29,624 --> 01:22:31,326
certain alleged top
secret documents"

1574
01:22:31,412 --> 01:22:33,140
Are you trying to piss me off?

1575
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:35,303
No, not me, Judge Gurfein.

1576
01:22:35,328 --> 01:22:37,288
If you look at the text of
his restraining order--

1577
01:22:37,397 --> 01:22:39,100
I read his restraining order.

1578
01:22:39,367 --> 01:22:42,265
So then you know that if The Times
was your source, we would be in

1579
01:22:42,343 --> 01:22:44,101
-direct violation of--
-I did not get the study

1580
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:45,476
from The Times.

1581
01:22:46,337 --> 01:22:47,274
You're sure?

1582
01:22:47,938 --> 01:22:48,922
We done?

1583
01:22:53,188 --> 01:22:54,852
Did you get it from <i>their</i> source?

1584
01:23:02,423 --> 01:23:03,579
Excuse me?

1585
01:23:06,698 --> 01:23:08,425
Did you get the study

1586
01:23:08,870 --> 01:23:11,112
from the same source
as The Times?

1587
01:23:13,972 --> 01:23:15,769
We do not reveal our sources.

1588
01:23:17,599 --> 01:23:19,497
"This action has been
commenced to enjoin

1589
01:23:19,522 --> 01:23:21,146
"The New York Times and its agents--"

1590
01:23:21,208 --> 01:23:23,489
-I get it, I get it.
-from disseminating or disclosing...

1591
01:23:26,661 --> 01:23:28,559
If you got the study
from the same source,

1592
01:23:28,708 --> 01:23:30,497
that would amount to collusion.

1593
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:33,311
Yeah, we could all
be executed at dawn.

1594
01:23:34,811 --> 01:23:37,022
And we could be held
in contempt of court.

1595
01:23:37,967 --> 01:23:40,780
Which means Mr. Bradlee and
Mrs. Graham could go to jail.

1596
01:23:45,414 --> 01:23:46,765
Mr. Bagdikian,

1597
01:23:48,179 --> 01:23:49,687
how likely is it

1598
01:23:50,211 --> 01:23:51,570
that your source

1599
01:23:51,856 --> 01:23:54,083
and The Times' source
are the same person?

1600
01:23:56,346 --> 01:23:57,541
It's likely.

1601
01:23:59,573 --> 01:24:00,557
How likely?

1602
01:24:03,468 --> 01:24:04,390
Very.

1603
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:07,460
-It's very likely.
-Yes.

1604
01:24:18,614 --> 01:24:19,965
What is all this?

1605
01:24:20,614 --> 01:24:22,364
Lemonade earnings.

1606
01:24:23,635 --> 01:24:26,776
Marina wanted me to put
it away for safekeeping.

1607
01:24:26,801 --> 01:24:27,893
Ah, wow.

1608
01:24:32,888 --> 01:24:33,927
We're publishing.

1609
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,044
Wow.

1610
01:24:42,130 --> 01:24:43,974
I didn't think Kay'd do it.

1611
01:24:47,318 --> 01:24:48,514
That's brave.

1612
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:51,865
Well, she's not the
only one who's brave.

1613
01:24:52,626 --> 01:24:55,673
Oh, what have you got to lose?

1614
01:24:55,907 --> 01:24:57,376
Uh, my job.

1615
01:24:57,736 --> 01:25:00,649
-My reputation.
-Oh, Ben, please.

1616
01:25:01,982 --> 01:25:04,396
We both know this
will do nothing but

1617
01:25:04,442 --> 01:25:06,489
burnish your reputation.

1618
01:25:07,097 --> 01:25:10,917
And as for your job, you can
always find another one.

1619
01:25:13,184 --> 01:25:15,598
If you're tryin' to
make me feel better,

1620
01:25:15,754 --> 01:25:17,332
there's nicer ways to do it.

1621
01:25:20,116 --> 01:25:21,366
You're very brave.

1622
01:25:24,283 --> 01:25:25,283
But Kay...

1623
01:25:26,759 --> 01:25:30,439
Kay is in a position she
never thought she'd be in.

1624
01:25:31,226 --> 01:25:33,116
A position I'm sure
plenty of people

1625
01:25:33,141 --> 01:25:34,991
don't think she should have.

1626
01:25:36,038 --> 01:25:39,663
And when you're told time and time
again that you're not good enough,

1627
01:25:39,741 --> 01:25:42,421
that your opinion
doesn't matter as much,

1628
01:25:43,902 --> 01:25:46,269
when they don't
just look past you,

1629
01:25:47,355 --> 01:25:49,996
when to them, you're
not even there,

1630
01:25:51,348 --> 01:25:53,739
when that's been your
reality for so long

1631
01:25:53,764 --> 01:25:56,184
it's hard not to let
yourself think it's true.

1632
01:25:57,716 --> 01:25:59,950
So, to make this decision,

1633
01:26:00,677 --> 01:26:03,036
to risk her fortune
and the company

1634
01:26:03,061 --> 01:26:05,411
that's been her entire life,

1635
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:09,071
well, I think that's brave.

1636
01:26:15,618 --> 01:26:17,415
-Bradlee.
<i>-Ben.</i>

1637
01:26:17,501 --> 01:26:19,000
<i>We got a problem.</i>

1638
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:31,453
Remember this?

1639
01:26:33,844 --> 01:26:35,719
-The day before the funeral.
-Yeah.

1640
01:26:35,744 --> 01:26:36,875
Wasn't it?

1641
01:26:37,750 --> 01:26:38,578
Yeah.

1642
01:26:40,669 --> 01:26:43,326
I didn't...I didn't want to do it, but

1643
01:26:44,045 --> 01:26:46,670
Fritz said I should
go in and

1644
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:49,373
say a few words
to the board and

1645
01:26:49,907 --> 01:26:50,938
so,

1646
01:26:51,384 --> 01:26:54,337
I-I tried to rehearse something

1647
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:57,150
but it all turned out so awful

1648
01:26:57,227 --> 01:26:59,618
and before I knew it, the car
was there ready to take me

1649
01:26:59,643 --> 01:27:01,532
and then you came out.

1650
01:27:02,306 --> 01:27:03,454
I remember.

1651
01:27:03,939 --> 01:27:07,111
You came out in your little
nightgown and your robe.

1652
01:27:07,769 --> 01:27:11,207
You hopped in the car
with me, gave me this.

1653
01:27:12,699 --> 01:27:16,418
Somehow, you managed to
scribble these notes for me

1654
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:19,660
so I'd know what to say.

1655
01:27:21,074 --> 01:27:23,425
Well, I-I don't have
my glasses up here.

1656
01:27:23,636 --> 01:27:26,568
-So, just read it for me.
-Mummy.

1657
01:27:26,623 --> 01:27:29,162
Oh, come on, just,
would you read it to me?

1658
01:27:33,528 --> 01:27:35,598
One, thank them.

1659
01:27:36,215 --> 01:27:37,364
Two,

1660
01:27:37,801 --> 01:27:41,192
there has been a crisis
but you know they will carry on.

1661
01:27:41,262 --> 01:27:44,387
Three, never expected
to be in this

1662
01:27:45,239 --> 01:27:46,949
situation.

1663
01:27:48,064 --> 01:27:51,291
Four, going off to clear mind

1664
01:27:51,316 --> 01:27:53,377
and think about the future.

1665
01:27:53,438 --> 01:27:58,226
Five, no changes at this time,
paper will remain in the family.

1666
01:27:58,524 --> 01:28:01,539
And six, and be carried
on in the tradition

1667
01:28:01,594 --> 01:28:03,781
-and so well said.
-So well said

1668
01:28:05,461 --> 01:28:09,422
You know, I just wanted
to hold on to the company

1669
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:10,888
for you and Don

1670
01:28:10,913 --> 01:28:12,662
-and Willie and Stephen.
-You did.

1671
01:28:12,882 --> 01:28:14,640
-You have.
-Well.

1672
01:28:17,782 --> 01:28:19,009
You know that quote--

1673
01:28:21,321 --> 01:28:22,306
The quote,

1674
01:28:22,491 --> 01:28:27,959
"A woman preaching is like a
dog walking on its hind legs,

1675
01:28:28,108 --> 01:28:30,857
"it's not done well and

1676
01:28:30,975 --> 01:28:34,631
"you're surprised to
see it's done at all."

1677
01:28:35,344 --> 01:28:37,625
-Samuel Johnson.
-Oh, Mummy.

1678
01:28:37,734 --> 01:28:39,943
That's a bunch of nonsense.

1679
01:28:39,998 --> 01:28:42,740
No, but that's the way
we all thought then.

1680
01:28:43,844 --> 01:28:44,735
You know.

1681
01:28:45,563 --> 01:28:48,477
I was never supposed
to be in this job.

1682
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:54,946
When my father chose your
dad to run the company,

1683
01:28:55,338 --> 01:28:57,752
I thought it was the most
natural thing in the world.

1684
01:28:57,830 --> 01:29:00,314
I was so proud
because, you know,

1685
01:29:00,339 --> 01:29:04,572
Phil was so brilliant and he was

1686
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:09,322
so gifted and

1687
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:13,564
but I thought that was the
way it was supposed to be.

1688
01:29:13,759 --> 01:29:15,689
Everybody thought that way then.

1689
01:29:17,671 --> 01:29:20,234
And I was raising you kids and

1690
01:29:22,124 --> 01:29:24,218
I was happy

1691
01:29:24,405 --> 01:29:28,763
in my life the way it was.

1692
01:29:31,175 --> 01:29:34,167
But then when it all fell
apart, you know, when

1693
01:29:38,738 --> 01:29:41,317
when Phil died, it was just

1694
01:29:41,574 --> 01:29:45,019
I was forty-five years old
and I had never held a

1695
01:29:45,074 --> 01:29:48,176
I'd never had to hold
a job in my life.

1696
01:29:50,837 --> 01:29:54,899
But I just, I loved
the paper, you know, I do.

1697
01:29:55,596 --> 01:29:59,799
I do so love the paper,
I don't want it to be my fault

1698
01:29:59,846 --> 01:30:01,698
I don't want to be the one who...

1699
01:30:02,465 --> 01:30:04,527
I don't want to let

1700
01:30:04,692 --> 01:30:08,155
Phil and my father and
all of you kids

1701
01:30:08,180 --> 01:30:10,202
and everybody down.

1702
01:30:11,710 --> 01:30:12,890
Mrs. Graham?

1703
01:30:21,977 --> 01:30:23,250
You ran here?

1704
01:30:23,485 --> 01:30:24,500
Yeah.

1705
01:30:25,969 --> 01:30:27,657
There's been a bit of a uh,

1706
01:30:28,305 --> 01:30:29,758
a complication.

1707
01:30:30,852 --> 01:30:34,383
I didn't understand at first but now
everything is of a different light.

1708
01:30:34,417 --> 01:30:37,761
Our source might be the same
as The New York Times'.

1709
01:30:38,042 --> 01:30:38,894
Okay.

1710
01:30:40,042 --> 01:30:42,472
If so, we could be
held in contempt.

1711
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:43,972
Meaning?

1712
01:30:44,632 --> 01:30:46,374
Well, we could all go to prison.

1713
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,436
Now putting that aside,

1714
01:30:53,066 --> 01:30:56,105
Katharine, I-I've come
to realize just

1715
01:30:57,387 --> 01:30:59,754
just how much
you have at stake.

1716
01:31:28,638 --> 01:31:30,099
Paul, I'm glad you're here.

1717
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:31,888
Fritz is sitting with
Mrs. Graham now.

1718
01:31:31,928 --> 01:31:33,912
-Ben is here.
-Yes, I figured he would be.

1719
01:31:58,350 --> 01:31:59,358
-Jesus Christ.
-Mr. Bradlee,

1720
01:31:59,383 --> 01:32:01,940
if you knew Mr. Bagdikian
received the study from

1721
01:32:01,987 --> 01:32:03,377
-the same source at the time,
-Well, I didn't know because

1722
01:32:03,402 --> 01:32:04,816
-that would have been useful...
-I'm not in the habit of asking

1723
01:32:04,841 --> 01:32:06,623
my reporters who
their sources are,

1724
01:32:06,648 --> 01:32:07,960
and if you've spent
any time in a real

1725
01:32:08,015 --> 01:32:09,482
goddamn newspaper,
you'd know why.

1726
01:32:09,507 --> 01:32:11,124
You understand he's
trying to help you, Ben?

1727
01:32:11,484 --> 01:32:13,343
Mrs. Graham, hi.

1728
01:32:14,157 --> 01:32:15,055
We can all-

1729
01:32:15,094 --> 01:32:17,828
We can all appreciate
why Ben wants to publish

1730
01:32:18,087 --> 01:32:19,395
and if these papers had
come from someone else,

1731
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:21,701
we might have been able
to skirt the issue.

1732
01:32:23,137 --> 01:32:25,176
Anything from
the folks upstairs?

1733
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:25,966
No.

1734
01:32:26,012 --> 01:32:26,965
We gotta start the run

1735
01:32:27,043 --> 01:32:29,840
or we won't get to the
carriers on time.

1736
01:32:33,379 --> 01:32:36,941
I disagreed with you earlier, but
I thought it brave, but this?

1737
01:32:37,027 --> 01:32:38,393
If we were to publish
knowing this,

1738
01:32:38,467 --> 01:32:40,294
it would just be irresponsible.

1739
01:32:40,417 --> 01:32:42,230
Fritz, do you agree?

1740
01:32:43,128 --> 01:32:47,238
Well, I don't particularly like the
idea of Kay as a convicted felon.

1741
01:32:48,418 --> 01:32:50,128
And then there's the
issue of the prospectus.

1742
01:32:50,153 --> 01:32:52,464
Based on the conversations I've
had with my friends at Kravath,

1743
01:32:52,535 --> 01:32:54,448
I believe a criminal
indictment would

1744
01:32:54,473 --> 01:32:56,519
qualify as a catastrophic event.

1745
01:32:56,817 --> 01:32:59,207
And given the likelihood
of indictment now...

1746
01:33:01,614 --> 01:33:02,526
Kay, it could--

1747
01:33:02,551 --> 01:33:04,660
Yes, I...I understand.

1748
01:33:06,677 --> 01:33:09,926
We uh, we have a responsibility
to the company, to the-

1749
01:33:09,973 --> 01:33:13,356
all the employees and to the
long term health of the paper.

1750
01:33:14,153 --> 01:33:15,567
Absolutely, Kay.

1751
01:33:19,013 --> 01:33:21,981
Yes. However, um...

1752
01:33:29,837 --> 01:33:32,338
The prospectus also talks about

1753
01:33:32,485 --> 01:33:34,533
the mission of
the paper which is

1754
01:33:35,307 --> 01:33:37,604
outstanding news
collection and reporting,

1755
01:33:37,629 --> 01:33:38,674
isn't that right?

1756
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:39,541
Yes.

1757
01:33:39,674 --> 01:33:40,619
And...

1758
01:33:40,947 --> 01:33:43,354
And it also says

1759
01:33:43,557 --> 01:33:45,166
that the newspaper
will be dedicated

1760
01:33:45,191 --> 01:33:46,979
to the welfare of the nation

1761
01:33:47,017 --> 01:33:49,822
and to the, uh...
principles of a free press.

1762
01:33:49,847 --> 01:33:50,740
Yes, but...

1763
01:33:50,765 --> 01:33:51,685
So,

1764
01:33:51,974 --> 01:33:53,717
one could argue

1765
01:33:53,881 --> 01:33:55,904
that the bankers
were put on notice.

1766
01:33:55,929 --> 01:33:58,131
But Kay, these are
extraordinary circumstances.

1767
01:33:58,182 --> 01:34:01,323
Are they? Are they?
For a newspaper?

1768
01:34:01,487 --> 01:34:03,745
One that covers the
Nixon White House?

1769
01:34:03,901 --> 01:34:06,752
Can you guarantee me that
we could go to print

1770
01:34:06,777 --> 01:34:09,041
without endangering
any of our soldiers--

1771
01:34:09,066 --> 01:34:10,119
You can't be considering--

1772
01:34:10,198 --> 01:34:12,104
I'm talking to Mr. Bradlee now.

1773
01:34:16,547 --> 01:34:19,547
Fritz, you're not gonna let
her do this, she can't--

1774
01:34:19,578 --> 01:34:21,922
Oh, no, she can, Arthur.

1775
01:34:21,947 --> 01:34:23,547
And it's entirely her decision.

1776
01:34:23,572 --> 01:34:25,097
Kay, you're allowing Mr. Bradlee

1777
01:34:25,175 --> 01:34:27,640
to uh, t-t-to lead you to folly.

1778
01:34:27,668 --> 01:34:29,417
The legacy of the
company is at stake.

1779
01:34:29,442 --> 01:34:30,213
-And if you want to
-Arthur.

1780
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:31,480
protect that legacy,

1781
01:34:31,949 --> 01:34:33,840
This company has been in my life

1782
01:34:33,865 --> 01:34:36,559
for longer than most of the people
working there have been alive

1783
01:34:36,584 --> 01:34:39,403
so I don't need the
lecture on legacy.

1784
01:34:41,321 --> 01:34:44,251
And this is no longer
my father's company.

1785
01:34:45,306 --> 01:34:47,408
It's no longer my
husband's company.

1786
01:34:47,658 --> 01:34:49,009
It's my company.

1787
01:34:49,878 --> 01:34:51,691
And anyone who thinks otherwise

1788
01:34:51,716 --> 01:34:53,816
probably doesn't
belong on my board.

1789
01:34:54,848 --> 01:34:56,817
Can you guarantee
me that we--

1790
01:34:56,848 --> 01:34:58,309
One hundred percent.

1791
01:34:58,457 --> 01:34:59,488
All right then.

1792
01:35:00,677 --> 01:35:02,544
My decision stands.

1793
01:35:03,630 --> 01:35:04,520
And I'm

1794
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:06,747
going to bed.

1795
01:35:23,606 --> 01:35:24,427
<i>It's Ben Bradlee.</i>

1796
01:35:24,567 --> 01:35:25,208
Run it.

1797
01:35:25,348 --> 01:35:25,981
Yes, sir.

1798
01:35:26,629 --> 01:35:27,387
Start it up.

1799
01:36:28,442 --> 01:36:29,371
Here we go.

1800
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,043
Let's go! Let's go!

1801
01:36:48,442 --> 01:36:49,582
More here!

1802
01:37:02,322 --> 01:37:04,096
I've got the Assistant
Attorney General.

1803
01:37:04,221 --> 01:37:05,197
Put him on.

1804
01:37:06,515 --> 01:37:07,726
Good morning.

1805
01:37:07,883 --> 01:37:09,523
<i>Good morning, this
is William Rehnquist</i>

1806
01:37:09,548 --> 01:37:12,054
<i>from the office of legal
counsel at Justice.</i>

1807
01:37:12,156 --> 01:37:13,093
Yes, sir.

1808
01:37:13,562 --> 01:37:16,546
<i>Mr. Bradlee, I have been advised
by the Secretary of Defense</i>

1809
01:37:16,571 --> 01:37:19,981
<i>that the material published in
The Washington Post this morning</i>

1810
01:37:20,059 --> 01:37:21,664
<i>contains the
information relating</i>

1811
01:37:21,727 --> 01:37:24,071
<i>to the national defense
of the United States</i>

1812
01:37:24,133 --> 01:37:26,727
<i>and bears a top secret
classification.</i>

1813
01:37:26,956 --> 01:37:29,612
<i>As such the publication
of this information</i>

1814
01:37:29,799 --> 01:37:32,369
<i>is directly prohibited
by the Espionage Act,</i>

1815
01:37:32,403 --> 01:37:34,815
<i>Title 18 of the
United States Code,</i>

1816
01:37:34,840 --> 01:37:36,761
<i>Section 793.</i>

1817
01:37:36,953 --> 01:37:39,961
<i>As publication will cause
irreparable injury</i>

1818
01:37:39,986 --> 01:37:42,438
<i>to the defense interests
of the United States,</i>

1819
01:37:42,631 --> 01:37:45,146
<i>I respectfully request that
you publish no further</i>

1820
01:37:45,171 --> 01:37:47,420
<i>information of this character.</i>

1821
01:37:47,898 --> 01:37:50,280
<i>And advise me that you
have made arrangements</i>

1822
01:37:50,374 --> 01:37:52,257
<i>for the return of
these documents</i>

1823
01:37:52,282 --> 01:37:54,101
<i>to the Department of Defense.</i>

1824
01:37:54,206 --> 01:37:56,401
Well, thank you for the call,
Mr. Rehnquist.

1825
01:37:56,426 --> 01:38:00,034
But I'm sure you understand,
I must respectfully decline.

1826
01:38:01,112 --> 01:38:02,784
<i>I appreciate your time.</i>

1827
01:38:07,672 --> 01:38:08,727
What's next?

1828
01:38:08,930 --> 01:38:09,969
We're going to court.

1829
01:38:10,290 --> 01:38:11,211
Today.

1830
01:38:11,391 --> 01:38:14,219
If we get a ruling in our
favor or The Times does,

1831
01:38:14,719 --> 01:38:17,415
we'll be at the Supreme
Court sometime next week.

1832
01:38:31,647 --> 01:38:33,202
We're focusing on Johnson.

1833
01:38:35,372 --> 01:38:38,247
I don't want any more arguments,
it's about shoes and about dresses.

1834
01:38:39,675 --> 01:38:40,503
Sorry.

1835
01:38:45,264 --> 01:38:47,022
Your Honor, the stories
published in The Times

1836
01:38:47,047 --> 01:38:49,756
and now The Post have created a
diplomatic and security disaster

1837
01:38:49,789 --> 01:38:51,328
for the United States.

1838
01:38:51,365 --> 01:38:54,662
How exactly have these papers
created a diplomatic disaster?

1839
01:38:54,687 --> 01:38:56,911
Why would other countries
talk to us in confidence

1840
01:38:56,936 --> 01:38:58,685
if secrets like these
can be leaked?

1841
01:38:58,734 --> 01:39:01,101
So, does this make it difficult
for the President to govern?

1842
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:03,771
If the President can't keep
secrets, he can't govern.

1843
01:39:04,128 --> 01:39:08,042
Nothing less than the integrity
of the presidency is at stake.

1844
01:39:08,683 --> 01:39:10,003
Yes, I know.

1845
01:39:10,339 --> 01:39:12,566
I'm sure it has rattled
investors, Terry.

1846
01:39:12,691 --> 01:39:14,042
That's why I'm calling you.

1847
01:39:15,002 --> 01:39:18,439
Yes, I understand a number of
them have considered pulling out

1848
01:39:18,464 --> 01:39:19,643
but we feel...

1849
01:39:21,291 --> 01:39:24,440
Of course. I stand
behind the decision.

1850
01:39:30,363 --> 01:39:32,307
Well, you know,
one could argue it's

1851
01:39:32,332 --> 01:39:34,371
raising the profile of The Post.

1852
01:39:36,701 --> 01:39:40,029
Would The Post have published
military plans for D-Day

1853
01:39:40,271 --> 01:39:41,959
if they'd had them in advance?

1854
01:39:43,238 --> 01:39:45,510
Well, I don't think
there's any comparison

1855
01:39:45,535 --> 01:39:47,527
between a pending
invasion of Europe

1856
01:39:47,573 --> 01:39:51,394
and a historical survey of American
involvement in the Vietnam war.

1857
01:39:53,503 --> 01:39:56,745
<i>The Supreme Court has decided to
hold a hearing tomorrow morning</i>

1858
01:39:56,933 --> 01:39:59,870
<i>to resolve the tangle of
conflicting decisions</i>

1859
01:40:00,019 --> 01:40:02,550
<i>over what of the Pentagon
papers can be published</i>

1860
01:40:02,644 --> 01:40:05,058
<i>and more broadly, the issue
of freedom of the press</i>

1861
01:40:05,083 --> 01:40:06,855
<i>versus government security.</i>

1862
01:40:07,290 --> 01:40:08,875
<i>But in agreeing
to hear the cases</i>

1863
01:40:08,900 --> 01:40:10,388
<i>of The New York Times and
The Washington Post--</i>

1864
01:40:10,428 --> 01:40:12,701
The Supremes granted us a

1865
01:40:13,295 --> 01:40:15,037
emergency expedited basis--

1866
01:40:15,154 --> 01:40:16,740
We're in court with
The Times tomorrow.

1867
01:40:18,967 --> 01:40:20,810
What are you so happy about?

1868
01:40:26,811 --> 01:40:28,413
I always wanted to be part

1869
01:40:28,600 --> 01:40:30,132
of a small rebellion.

1870
01:40:40,423 --> 01:40:44,572
<i>I ask him what he considers the
most important revelations to date</i>

1871
01:40:44,642 --> 01:40:46,103
<i>from the Pentagon documents.</i>

1872
01:40:46,334 --> 01:40:48,396
<i>I think the lesson is the
people of this country</i>

1873
01:40:48,421 --> 01:40:51,662
<i>can't afford to let the President
run the country by himself--</i>

1874
01:40:52,449 --> 01:40:54,972
<i>even foreign affairs any
more than domestic affairs</i>

1875
01:40:54,997 --> 01:40:56,465
<i>without the help of Congress.</i>

1876
01:40:56,551 --> 01:40:58,738
<i>I was struck in fact by
President Johnson's reaction</i>

1877
01:40:58,763 --> 01:41:01,237
<i>to these revelations
as close to treason.</i>

1878
01:41:01,534 --> 01:41:03,862
<i>Because it reflected
to me the sense</i>

1879
01:41:03,917 --> 01:41:05,870
<i>that what was damaging
to the reputation</i>

1880
01:41:05,895 --> 01:41:08,932
<i>of a particular administration--
a particular individual</i>

1881
01:41:09,042 --> 01:41:10,972
<i>was, in itself, treason</i>

1882
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:14,331
<i>which is very close to saying,
"I am The State."</i>

1883
01:41:22,213 --> 01:41:23,143
Ben.

1884
01:41:26,710 --> 01:41:28,593
What on Earth are you doing?

1885
01:41:36,864 --> 01:41:37,794
Oh.

1886
01:41:41,833 --> 01:41:42,732
Oh.

1887
01:41:45,149 --> 01:41:47,563
They all followed your lead,
published the papers.

1888
01:41:48,930 --> 01:41:50,594
At least we're not alone.

1889
01:41:52,036 --> 01:41:53,652
No matter what happens tomorrow,

1890
01:41:53,677 --> 01:41:56,254
we are not a little
local paper anymore.

1891
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:57,473
Hm.

1892
01:42:16,963 --> 01:42:18,213
I'm sorry.

1893
01:42:22,229 --> 01:42:25,141
Mrs. Graham, there's an entrance
over on the side for the appellates.

1894
01:42:25,197 --> 01:42:26,784
Oh, thank you very much.

1895
01:42:28,385 --> 01:42:30,158
I'm sorry I'm walking so fast.

1896
01:42:30,183 --> 01:42:32,294
I was supposed to be
here half hour ago

1897
01:42:32,319 --> 01:42:33,740
but then I had to make
copies of the brief

1898
01:42:33,765 --> 01:42:35,224
and there was so
much traffic and I

1899
01:42:35,435 --> 01:42:37,013
just wouldn't think there'd
be all these people.

1900
01:42:37,038 --> 01:42:38,474
Well, no, you wouldn't.

1901
01:42:38,499 --> 01:42:39,951
You work for Roger Clark, then?

1902
01:42:40,021 --> 01:42:41,419
I work for the government.

1903
01:42:41,751 --> 01:42:43,556
the Solicitor General's office.

1904
01:42:43,626 --> 01:42:45,361
Oh, you're on the other team.

1905
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:46,611
Mrs. Graham,

1906
01:42:47,185 --> 01:42:49,238
I probably shouldn't say this.

1907
01:42:49,302 --> 01:42:51,396
Um...my brother...

1908
01:42:51,896 --> 01:42:53,607
he's still over there.

1909
01:42:54,390 --> 01:42:55,351
And...

1910
01:42:56,968 --> 01:42:58,210
Well, I hope you win.

1911
01:43:00,193 --> 01:43:02,966
Besides, I like someone telling
these guys what's what.

1912
01:43:03,013 --> 01:43:04,528
But don't tell my
boss I said that.

1913
01:43:04,552 --> 01:43:06,521
He'd fire me just
for talking to you.

1914
01:43:21,156 --> 01:43:22,234
I told you to be here at 8:00.

1915
01:43:22,367 --> 01:43:24,515
Yes, I was here at 8:00,
but Richard sent me back.

1916
01:43:24,562 --> 01:43:25,644
Is Richard your boss?

1917
01:43:25,816 --> 01:43:27,793
No, but you weren't here, so--

1918
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:29,855
I don't want excuses.
Just take a seat.

1919
01:43:31,860 --> 01:43:33,782
-Mrs. Graham.
-Morning.

1920
01:43:37,421 --> 01:43:38,937
Morning, gentlemen.

1921
01:43:39,007 --> 01:43:40,523
-Morning.
-Punch, Ed.

1922
01:43:41,345 --> 01:43:43,626
Nice to be on the same side
for a change.

1923
01:43:43,782 --> 01:43:45,017
I'll tell you what's nice.

1924
01:43:45,517 --> 01:43:48,423
Making the front page of your
newspaper on the daily basis.

1925
01:43:49,089 --> 01:43:52,948
Must be a lot of people from Boston
to Washington reading about us.

1926
01:43:53,172 --> 01:43:56,532
Yes, well, I suppose
it's appropriate

1927
01:43:57,313 --> 01:43:59,071
given what's at stake.

1928
01:44:00,407 --> 01:44:01,969
All rise.

1929
01:44:04,996 --> 01:44:07,894
The Honorable the Chief Justice
and the Associate Justices

1930
01:44:07,919 --> 01:44:10,465
of the Supreme Court
of the United States.

1931
01:44:11,177 --> 01:44:14,747
All yea, all yea, all yea.

1932
01:44:15,572 --> 01:44:18,220
All persons having business
before the Honorable...

1933
01:44:20,688 --> 01:44:22,148
Mr. Rosenthal! Mr. Rosenthal!

1934
01:44:22,297 --> 01:44:23,243
Sulzberger!

1935
01:44:23,484 --> 01:44:25,609
Sulzberger, do you think
they'll side to your favor?

1936
01:44:25,688 --> 01:44:27,290
Overall we feel encouraged.

1937
01:44:28,173 --> 01:44:31,173
27 congressmen filed amicus
briefs on our behalf.

1938
01:44:31,712 --> 01:44:32,923
As well as the ACLU...

1939
01:44:33,025 --> 01:44:35,387
-We should make a statement.
-I think that's her job.

1940
01:44:35,412 --> 01:44:38,107
I believe everything we had
to say we've already said.

1941
01:44:59,167 --> 01:45:00,378
Meg Greenfield.

1942
01:45:01,972 --> 01:45:02,753
Okay.

1943
01:45:03,113 --> 01:45:04,714
Everyone, listen up!

1944
01:45:05,082 --> 01:45:05,832
Listen up.

1945
01:45:06,175 --> 01:45:07,191
We've got a decision.

1946
01:45:07,683 --> 01:45:08,613
We've got a decision.

1947
01:45:14,219 --> 01:45:16,211
The Supreme Court,
the decision's in.

1948
01:45:27,563 --> 01:45:28,665
The vote is...

1949
01:45:30,618 --> 01:45:32,172
Six to three...

1950
01:45:32,917 --> 01:45:35,940
Six to three, we win!
We win!

1951
01:45:36,003 --> 01:45:37,541
And so does The Times!

1952
01:45:37,697 --> 01:45:38,518
Whoo!

1953
01:45:41,197 --> 01:45:42,009
Yes!

1954
01:45:45,314 --> 01:45:46,642
No shit.

1955
01:45:49,923 --> 01:45:50,892
Nice job, Gene.

1956
01:45:51,368 --> 01:45:52,165
Whoo!

1957
01:45:52,227 --> 01:45:54,211
-No gloating.
-I'm just satisfied.

1958
01:45:59,279 --> 01:46:00,052
What?

1959
01:46:00,145 --> 01:46:01,912
I can't hear you, it's too loud.

1960
01:46:02,397 --> 01:46:03,171
Oh, okay.

1961
01:46:03,220 --> 01:46:05,009
Listen up, everybody,
listen up.

1962
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:07,013
Uh, Justice Black's opinion.

1963
01:46:07,083 --> 01:46:07,880
Okay.

1964
01:46:10,653 --> 01:46:13,270
The Founding Fathers
gave the free press

1965
01:46:14,090 --> 01:46:16,012
the protection it must have

1966
01:46:19,249 --> 01:46:22,624
to fulfill its essential
role in our democracy.

1967
01:46:26,675 --> 01:46:29,917
The press was to serve the
governed, not the governors.

1968
01:46:35,424 --> 01:46:36,495
Thank you.

1969
01:46:55,496 --> 01:46:56,683
That's great.

1970
01:47:12,586 --> 01:47:16,071
Do you know what my husband
said about the news?

1971
01:47:16,493 --> 01:47:19,345
He called it the first
rough draft of history.

1972
01:47:20,009 --> 01:47:21,337
That's good isn't it?

1973
01:47:22,431 --> 01:47:25,110
Oh, well, we don't always
get it right, you know.

1974
01:47:25,135 --> 01:47:27,821
We're not always perfect
but I figure we just

1975
01:47:27,884 --> 01:47:29,486
keep on it, you know?

1976
01:47:29,573 --> 01:47:30,956
That's the job, isn't it?

1977
01:47:35,692 --> 01:47:36,723
Yes, it is.

1978
01:47:52,759 --> 01:47:55,423
Oh, Ken Clauson came
by to see me earlier.

1979
01:47:55,448 --> 01:47:56,212
Oh?

1980
01:47:56,416 --> 01:47:58,541
Apparently Justice
is still considering

1981
01:47:58,566 --> 01:48:00,252
criminal charges against us

1982
01:48:01,275 --> 01:48:02,861
And you're not worried?

1983
01:48:02,916 --> 01:48:05,072
Nope. No, Katharine,
that's your job.

1984
01:48:05,205 --> 01:48:06,416
I suppose it is.

1985
01:48:06,666 --> 01:48:09,564
Oh, thank God, the court
ruling was very clear.

1986
01:48:09,850 --> 01:48:11,186
Yeah, yeah, I know.

1987
01:48:11,272 --> 01:48:13,506
I'm sure Nixon will
fall right in line.

1988
01:48:13,655 --> 01:48:15,795
Good. Because you know
I don't think I could

1989
01:48:15,820 --> 01:48:18,171
ever live through
something like this again.

1990
01:48:19,934 --> 01:48:23,340
<i>I want it clearly understood
that from now on,</i>

1991
01:48:23,686 --> 01:48:24,506
<i>never</i>

1992
01:48:24,678 --> 01:48:26,967
<i>no reporter from
The Washington Post</i>

1993
01:48:26,992 --> 01:48:29,194
<i>is ever to be in The White House.
Is that clear?</i>

1994
01:48:29,219 --> 01:48:30,159
<i>Absolutely.</i>

1995
01:48:31,831 --> 01:48:33,730
<i>Never, never in
The White House.</i>

1996
01:48:34,269 --> 01:48:35,995
<i>No church service.</i>

1997
01:48:36,152 --> 01:48:38,613
<i>Nothing with Mrs. Nixon
does, you tell Connie.</i>

1998
01:48:38,722 --> 01:48:40,956
<i>Don't tell Mrs. Nixon
'cause she'll approve it.</i>

1999
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:43,439
<i>No reporter from
The Washington Post</i>

2000
01:48:43,464 --> 01:48:46,119
<i>is ever to be in
The White House again.</i>

2001
01:48:46,189 --> 01:48:47,650
<i>And no photographer either.</i>

2002
01:48:47,815 --> 01:48:49,331
<i>No photographer, is that clear?</i>

2003
01:48:49,487 --> 01:48:51,518
<i>None ever to be in.</i>

2004
01:48:51,565 --> 01:48:53,221
<i>That is a total order.</i>

2005
01:48:53,268 --> 01:48:55,635
<i>And if necessary, I'll fire you.
You understand?</i>

2006
01:48:55,690 --> 01:48:59,104
<i>-I do understand.
-Okay. All right. Good.</i>

2007
01:49:19,843 --> 01:49:21,508
<i>D.C. Police, 2nd Precinct.</i>

2008
01:49:21,578 --> 01:49:23,195
Yes, hello, this is Frank Wills.

2009
01:49:23,323 --> 01:49:26,179
I think we might have a burglary
in progress at the Watergate.
