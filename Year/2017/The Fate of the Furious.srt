00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,095
<i>HAVANA, CUBA</i>

2
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:07,233
-

3
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:09,899
<i>We swap in parts from Ford
Plymouths and Cadillac.</i>

4
00:02:10,596 --> 00:02:12,780
<i>My grandfather bought it in 1957.</i>

5
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,230
<i>When he died it passed to my father.
Then my brother and now to me.</i>

6
00:02:16,522 --> 00:02:19,454
<i>Look at this,
this is an engine from a boat.</i>

7
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:20,883
<i>- No way.
- Yeah!</i>

8
00:02:20,898 --> 00:02:22,823
<i>Whatever it takes
to keep it running!</i>

9
00:02:23,236 --> 00:02:24,790
This is a cuban spirit.

10
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,910
<i>Your spirit, keep it up.
Never ever lose that.</i>

11
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:28,749
<i>Dom..</i>

12
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,334
<i>It's your cousin..
He's in trouble, come quickly!</i>

13
00:02:43,068 --> 00:02:45,547
Please don't do this,
Understand my problem.

14
00:02:45,839 --> 00:02:47,164
You know how I make a
living on my car.

15
00:02:47,255 --> 00:02:48,319
Not my problem bro.

16
00:02:49,396 --> 00:02:51,364
Dominic Toretto..
I heard about you.

17
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:53,291
Welcome to my island.

18
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,290
Why you hooking up
my cousin's car?

19
00:02:55,402 --> 00:03:00,135
In the morning, I gave it to him..
He can't pay.. I take the car.

20
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:00,907
I just need a few more days.

21
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:02,587
Few more days isn't
part of the deal.

22
00:03:04,945 --> 00:03:06,345
Make a deal
you gotta give up to it.

23
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,280
You make a deal
You gonna give up to it.

24
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,310
Gonna give up to it?

25
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:15,326
So you are one of those types..

26
00:03:16,222 --> 00:03:18,922
Take everyone's ride and then
ship it back to the states.

27
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:21,373
<i>You should show your
people some respect.</i>

28
00:03:21,573 --> 00:03:23,091
You watch your mouth.

29
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,297
Now you got a problem.

30
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:33,362
- I'm gonna keep it about the cars.
- You scared me there!

31
00:03:34,174 --> 00:03:36,199
You want a car?
Get it the right way.

32
00:03:36,276 --> 00:03:38,853
- How?
- Race war.

33
00:03:39,272 --> 00:03:41,236
I already own it, bro.

34
00:03:42,182 --> 00:03:43,532
Not that car.

35
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:46,159
Mine.

36
00:03:47,253 --> 00:03:50,327
Dom, his car is the
fastest car in the Island.

37
00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:52,201
Do you know what he
has in that hood?

38
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:54,385
Do you know, it doesn't matter
what's under a hood?

39
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:58,253
The only thing that matters is
who's behind the wheels.

40
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:01,199
- You think so?
- I know so.

41
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:03,269
Then race his car.

42
00:04:05,271 --> 00:04:07,871
We ain't racing a quarter mile here.

43
00:04:08,245 --> 00:04:09,889
We race the cuban mile.

44
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:12,274
Done!

45
00:04:27,063 --> 00:04:28,543
I'd wish you what
you're trying to do.

46
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,988
My car is the slowest
car on the Island.

47
00:04:34,634 --> 00:04:36,102
What else?

48
00:04:36,336 --> 00:04:39,169
Pull the seats the doors
the battery..

49
00:04:39,205 --> 00:04:41,298
Leave the motor,
take it off.

50
00:04:43,109 --> 00:04:46,203
- Laughing gas?
- Nah, Fed. This is cuban NOS.

51
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,144
You guys are crazy.

52
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:52,477
What are you doing?

53
00:04:52,885 --> 00:04:54,319
Why you messing
with the west-gate.

54
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:57,112
Used to play.

55
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,350
It's in emergencies.

56
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:00,938
You know that's way too much
booze for that engine.

57
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,162
- It's going to be fast.
- It's gonna be bomb.

58
00:05:04,697 --> 00:05:06,288
Only needs to go a mile.

59
00:05:39,846 --> 00:05:40,974
<i>Be fast!</i>

60
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:43,494
<i>Be safe!</i>

61
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:48,122
<i>But don't be last.
Racers ready..?</i>

62
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:49,777
<i>Go..!</i>

63
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:19,629
<i>Stop.</i>

64
00:06:27,313 --> 00:06:30,282
That car belongs in the trash bro.

65
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:22,224
- Where are we going?
- I don't know. Let's go.

66
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:39,344
- Go straight..
- Come on in.

67
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,529
Adios, Toretto.

68
00:08:05,576 --> 00:08:07,210
See if this one works.

69
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,378
That's impossible..

70
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:36,619
Look out.

71
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:32,351
A Deal's a deal.

72
00:10:34,473 --> 00:10:35,702
You own my car.

73
00:10:37,796 --> 00:10:39,611
And you earn my respect.

74
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:55,313
Keep your car

75
00:10:56,549 --> 00:10:58,342
your respect is good enough for me.

76
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,229
Cousin.

77
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:07,723
Sorry bout your car,

78
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,496
Your's was too slow
for a Torreto anyway.

79
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:18,102
Your Impala.
Are you serious?

80
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:35,636
-

81
00:12:05,196 --> 00:12:06,458
Look at that smile

82
00:12:07,153 --> 00:12:08,245
I love it when you smile.

83
00:12:08,287 --> 00:12:10,084
Make me happy

84
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,941
I think this place makes you happy.

85
00:12:15,973 --> 00:12:17,320
Like it speaks to you.

86
00:12:20,777 --> 00:12:24,201
You remember that guy?
The Racer and his dad.

87
00:12:25,128 --> 00:12:27,120
- The one with the boat engine.
- Yeah!

88
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,240
- yeah.
- Of course.

89
00:12:29,241 --> 00:12:32,098
I was looking at them, and I..

90
00:12:32,867 --> 00:12:37,283
And I couldn't help but too imagine
what you'd be like, if you were dad.

91
00:12:39,218 --> 00:12:42,278
No, no, no.
I'm not pregnant.

92
00:12:45,657 --> 00:12:47,191
Is that what you want?

93
00:12:47,393 --> 00:12:49,955
It's not about what I want
or what you want..

94
00:12:51,227 --> 00:12:53,650
It's about why
we haven't asked the question.

95
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:19,288
<i>Can I help you with that?</i>

96
00:13:20,226 --> 00:13:22,353
- What?
- You need a hand?

97
00:13:23,229 --> 00:13:25,220
Yeah, I think I do.

98
00:13:25,364 --> 00:13:27,524
Sounds like you're
not getting any fuel.

99
00:13:27,594 --> 00:13:28,162
Yeah.

100
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:30,135
Have a look inside that solenoid.

101
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:32,329
See if we can get
some power into it.

102
00:13:34,497 --> 00:13:36,205
What brings you to Cuba?

103
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,025
The same thing that brings
everyone else to Cuba.

104
00:13:41,126 --> 00:13:43,214
Culture. People. Beauty.

105
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:45,309
What brings you to Cuba?

106
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:48,348
- Work!
- Must be casual Friday.

107
00:13:50,057 --> 00:13:51,848
How is that honeymoon going Dom?

108
00:13:57,196 --> 00:13:59,164
Your fuel relay is missing.

109
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,361
I know.

110
00:14:06,464 --> 00:14:09,898
I'd love play games.
Beaten the bests alone.

111
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:13,106
I'm kinda in a rush,
so if you got something to say...

112
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:15,375
Oh this is a very different game
that I can assure you.

113
00:14:16,215 --> 00:14:17,367
This..?

114
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:20,641
There is something much greater
at work here.

115
00:14:21,753 --> 00:14:23,287
This is fate.

116
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:26,315
- I choose to make my own fate.
- Not today.

117
00:14:27,093 --> 00:14:29,865
This is the road you take
to your apartment every morning.

118
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:33,345
What else is different, Dom?
The Santiago's closed?

119
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:35,861
Did you have to cross two blocks
to go get your cuban coffee?

120
00:14:35,931 --> 00:14:37,924
So, what is it?
Black, no sugar?

121
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:43,137
Yeah.. I've put a lot of work
into getting you here in today.

122
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,376
Now that I'm here,
what do you want?

123
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,175
I want you to work for me.

124
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,773
Work for you?

125
00:14:49,843 --> 00:14:52,406
I could have saved you
a lot of time then.

126
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:54,538
See, I don't work for anyone.

127
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:56,862
You can't walk away from this Dom.

128
00:14:57,068 --> 00:14:59,564
We're gonna have this
conversation one way or the other.

129
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,192
See that's the funny
thing about fate.

130
00:15:03,662 --> 00:15:04,548
It's cunning.

131
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,565
It can bring you beautiful things,

132
00:15:06,635 --> 00:15:08,646
and it can also bring you
moments like this.

133
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:25,249
I will hear that you
want to work for me.

134
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:27,916
You're gonna betray your brother,

135
00:15:27,986 --> 00:15:30,151
abandon your code,
shatter your family.

136
00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:31,364
See, your team..

137
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,527
Is about to go up against the
only thing they can't handle.

138
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,036
What's that?

139
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,807
You.

140
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:45,103
Oh, and Dom,
I wouldn't mention this to anyone.

141
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,307
They are gonna be hitting us
with everything they've got.

142
00:15:57,116 --> 00:15:59,240
So, we wanna engage
with maximum speed.

143
00:15:59,316 --> 00:16:02,259
Neutralize the shooters
and then move on to our objective.

144
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,922
There are two things
I want you to keep in mind,

145
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:05,747
Number one,

146
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:07,525
I choose you for this squad

147
00:16:07,595 --> 00:16:11,141
because you are the most
fearsome warriors on the planet.

148
00:16:11,341 --> 00:16:12,505
And number two,

149
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,881
You go out there, you do your job.
And you take them down.

150
00:16:16,168 --> 00:16:18,227
Everyone... and I mean
everyone..

151
00:16:19,505 --> 00:16:21,196
Manice and pedice at the mall.

152
00:16:21,573 --> 00:16:22,560
Later on today.

153
00:16:28,214 --> 00:16:30,148
Alright, show 'em what you got.

154
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:22,980
I don't wanna play anymore.

155
00:17:24,803 --> 00:17:26,809
Alright, let's go, come on,
let's go, let's go.

156
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:29,058
- Final 2 minutes.
- Quite the junior section.

157
00:17:32,984 --> 00:17:36,084
Oh yeah. That's moms
they come out to sport the kids.

158
00:17:36,284 --> 00:17:38,081
Except there seems to be more moms
than kids,

159
00:17:39,087 --> 00:17:40,377
Way more like moms and..

160
00:17:43,523 --> 00:17:46,250
Yeah, it's a big soccer job.
Let's go girls.

161
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:48,223
So your intel was spot on...

162
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:51,437
A democly 7 EMP weapon
went missing in the gulf.

163
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,089
Arms dealer from the
Liberation front have it in Berlin.

164
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,744
- Shit.
- This thing can wipe out..

165
00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:57,908
An entire electrical grid
in a major city.

166
00:17:58,137 --> 00:18:00,298
No lights, no power,
instant stone age.

167
00:18:01,106 --> 00:18:01,667
Chloe, Maya...

168
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:03,267
You can't let her run
by you like that.

169
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:04,242
- Let's go, let's go.
- Hey, Hobbs.

170
00:18:04,276 --> 00:18:06,210
It's a class 4 WMD.

171
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:07,303
You have the no idea what's
at stake here...

172
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:08,142
Yes..!

173
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,341
I know exactly what is
at stake here, okay?

174
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:12,501
If Pink Butterflies
beat my Red Dragon

175
00:18:12,571 --> 00:18:14,690
that means we lose the championship.

176
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:17,423
Which means I have 20 little girls
who are crying..

177
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,787
And that's not a good thing.

178
00:18:18,895 --> 00:18:21,578
Which then means I have to spend
a lot of time in ice cream shops

179
00:18:21,648 --> 00:18:23,410
and lot of time in Tay-Tay concerts.

180
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:27,164
- Tay-Tay?
- Yep? Taylor Swift.

181
00:18:27,266 --> 00:18:29,113
You gotta be shitting me
Get it together.

182
00:18:29,505 --> 00:18:30,486
Let's go girls.

183
00:18:30,586 --> 00:18:31,224
We need to do this,

184
00:18:31,337 --> 00:18:34,711
Lot of lives are at stake.
I need to be clear here.

185
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:38,097
US Government can not sanction
this operation in anyway.

186
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:38,999
You're on your own.

187
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:41,552
This thing goes sideways
you don't just get burned,

188
00:18:41,976 --> 00:18:43,155
you go to prison.

189
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,515
And there's nothing we can do
to get you out.

190
00:18:46,816 --> 00:18:48,116
Let me tell you something.

191
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,288
The only thing that I love
more than saving lives..

192
00:18:52,037 --> 00:18:53,291
Is my daughter.

193
00:18:53,491 --> 00:18:56,250
So you don't shut up with this
government bullshit right now

194
00:18:56,295 --> 00:19:01,096
and start showing some team spirit
and respect for the Red Dragons.

195
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:05,236
I'm gonna have all 20 of them lined
up kick you right in the Tay-Tay.

196
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:09,267
Go, Dragons!

197
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:11,176
Say it again.

198
00:19:11,377 --> 00:19:13,732
- Go, Dragons!
- Good boy.

199
00:19:14,082 --> 00:19:16,201
Go Dragons..
Go Dragons..

200
00:19:17,118 --> 00:19:19,180
Yeah, he's open... Yup!

201
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:21,118
Yes!

202
00:19:21,887 --> 00:19:24,151
That is my daughter right there!
Yes!

203
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:26,203
Yes, come here.

204
00:19:27,292 --> 00:19:29,229
- Awesome.
- Nice job.

205
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:35,163
Dad's gotta go to work?

206
00:19:35,263 --> 00:19:37,327
Oh yeah,
daddy's gotta go to work.

207
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,297
Now, you gonna need to get a team
that you can trust.

208
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,237
Oh, I already got one.

209
00:20:03,295 --> 00:20:06,092
- Hey, Dom.
- Hey, Hobbs.

210
00:20:06,162 --> 00:20:08,224
We got a job in Berlin,
and I need a favor, brother.

211
00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:10,635
No problem.

212
00:20:10,653 --> 00:20:12,365
I'll grab the team and
meet you in Berlin.

213
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:15,196
Good.

214
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:44,591
You were only to supposed
to create a diversion, Roman.

215
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:45,905
That was a diversion.

216
00:20:45,975 --> 00:20:47,793
How many of the damn explosives
did you use?

217
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,137
I do not know, Tez.
All of it?

218
00:20:50,337 --> 00:20:52,240
- Wait, all of it?
- Roman, Jesus!

219
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,175
- Right.
- Yeah, more of you fan club, eh?

220
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:02,039
They're still on us.

221
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:04,889
These guys are taking it personal.

222
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:07,759
Roman, we just blown up their
facility and stole their EMP.

223
00:21:08,092 --> 00:21:09,574
Other than the
doctor's cold fingers,

224
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,889
I'd say it's about as
personal as it can get.

225
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,138
- Phase 2.
- Phase 2?

226
00:21:14,325 --> 00:21:16,266
So you just gonna keep
that to yourself?

227
00:21:16,336 --> 00:21:17,530
What happen to Phase 1?

228
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,622
What about that part?

229
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:20,212
Yeah, remember the airplane?

230
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:22,198
Everyone drove their
cars out but you.

231
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:24,031
I told you my engine seized up.

232
00:21:24,231 --> 00:21:25,130
Seized up?

233
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,480
Just follow my lead, okay?

234
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:30,213
Roman, whatever you do.
Don't think.

235
00:21:31,013 --> 00:21:32,215
Tez, drop it.

236
00:21:32,715 --> 00:21:33,377
Bomb's away.

237
00:21:36,155 --> 00:21:37,150
Split now!

238
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:42,393
Holy shit!

239
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,262
<i>Look out..!</i>

240
00:21:57,885 --> 00:22:00,543
- Rock n roll.
- Just so you know.

241
00:22:00,743 --> 00:22:01,771
You miss some.

242
00:22:02,142 --> 00:22:04,149
I'll just wait for it.

243
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:21,277
I hate you, Tej!

244
00:22:30,624 --> 00:22:31,670
You good?

245
00:22:34,112 --> 00:22:36,080
I'll see you when it's done.

246
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:40,884
Alright. Great job, team.

247
00:22:40,954 --> 00:22:42,854
Let's break up and meet
me at the safe house.

248
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:58,970
Hell of a job, brother.

249
00:22:59,215 --> 00:23:01,016
When we can get back
to the base. Beers on me.

250
00:23:25,138 --> 00:23:27,009
You lost your god damn mind,
Toretto!

251
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:32,207
Toretto you put hands on that thing,

252
00:23:32,232 --> 00:23:35,025
you're gonna have the whole world
coming for you including me.

253
00:23:39,996 --> 00:23:41,236
I do not know what you're doing

254
00:23:41,281 --> 00:23:42,882
but you better think
about this, Toretto.

255
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:46,117
It ain't too late to stop this.

256
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,188
It is now.

257
00:24:04,727 --> 00:24:07,031
That some..

258
00:24:07,056 --> 00:24:07,593
What?

259
00:24:07,618 --> 00:24:09,125
Wait a second, what
are you talking about?

260
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,348
- Dom taking the EMP.
- Bullshit.

261
00:24:12,794 --> 00:24:13,789
Where are you?

262
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:15,602
It's too late for me.
Get out of here.

263
00:24:15,672 --> 00:24:17,039
I saw that look in his eyes.

264
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:19,593
I've seen that look before.

265
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:21,749
Dominic Toretto just went rogue.

266
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:25,760
I got his phone records, y'all.

267
00:25:25,976 --> 00:25:28,359
It's a whole bunch of calls
to untraceable numbers.

268
00:25:28,522 --> 00:25:29,725
Burner phone, right?

269
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,816
Nah. Scrambled.

270
00:25:31,022 --> 00:25:33,425
Faked number. They got
some sort of micro-router..

271
00:25:33,495 --> 00:25:35,899
..to bury the signal patterns
which means Dom is clearly..

272
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:38,312
..communicating with somebody
that is above our pay grade.

273
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:40,437
Look,
I do not know Dom as well as you,

274
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:42,331
but if we just look at the facts.

275
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:45,062
Dom's been having highly encrypted

276
00:25:45,132 --> 00:25:47,871
conversation with some
mysterious person.

277
00:25:48,701 --> 00:25:50,532
He took out Hobbs.

278
00:25:50,557 --> 00:25:53,321
He stole the EMP,
now he's disappeared.

279
00:25:53,346 --> 00:25:54,509
So what're you saying?

280
00:25:54,534 --> 00:25:56,507
Maybe we should
consider the fact that..

281
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,503
Hobb's right.

282
00:25:58,196 --> 00:26:00,255
Dom did go rogue.

283
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,520
- Letty.
- Before you judge the man,

284
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,860
Remember you're breathing
now because he saved your life.

285
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:17,588
You just gonna let her
bump yourself like that

286
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:21,755
I'm just hanging out.
That was a little risk.

287
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,681
What you gonna do.
Email her?

288
00:26:40,645 --> 00:26:41,771
Long wait fellas.

289
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,156
Thank you.

290
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:46,641
Well, this is an
exciting new look.

291
00:26:46,711 --> 00:26:49,646
It's a little tight on
the crotch as always.

292
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,171
What boyband bus did she fallen off?

293
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:54,184
He's my new junior associate.

294
00:26:54,254 --> 00:26:56,187
He's working with me on this.
All yours.

295
00:26:56,212 --> 00:26:56,859
Mr Nobody and I

296
00:26:56,929 --> 00:26:59,171
have been given the authority
to get you out of this.

297
00:26:59,196 --> 00:27:02,324
All you have to do is agree
to the terms and you're free.

298
00:27:03,312 --> 00:27:05,371
Restraining wills, talking about,
what terms?

299
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:07,878
Confess to your crimes in Berlin.

300
00:27:07,903 --> 00:27:09,773
Treason,
international espionage.

301
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:11,858
Massive destruction
of scenic property.

302
00:27:11,883 --> 00:27:13,757
You do that, we close the case.

303
00:27:13,964 --> 00:27:14,468
And?

304
00:27:14,493 --> 00:27:17,428
And the DSS blacklist.
Germany love that.

305
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:19,374
Officially you're a criminal.

306
00:27:19,574 --> 00:27:20,274
Woah, woah, woah.

307
00:27:20,344 --> 00:27:22,072
You need to work on
your delivery alright.

308
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:23,248
Unofficially.

309
00:27:25,088 --> 00:27:28,057
You're off the books.
Come work with me.

310
00:27:29,243 --> 00:27:31,833
- I'm not a criminal.
- Luke Come on. Labels.

311
00:27:32,536 --> 00:27:34,367
There is no confession.

312
00:27:34,392 --> 00:27:36,007
There are no back room deals.

313
00:27:36,032 --> 00:27:38,336
Got myself into this,
I'm gonna get myself out of it.

314
00:27:38,361 --> 00:27:39,046
You know that.

315
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,023
As you and that's
what I told them.

316
00:27:41,048 --> 00:27:42,711
Well, there you have it.

317
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,979
Good luck in the course, man!

318
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,547
What about your daughter?

319
00:27:51,582 --> 00:27:53,502
You know, if you're not
gonna do it your country,

320
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:55,357
at least do it for your kid.

321
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,259
Big mistake kid.

322
00:27:59,259 --> 00:28:00,984
Hold on. Look, look.

323
00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:02,730
He's still working from the manual.

324
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,013
I mean, he doesn't even
really know the rules.

325
00:28:05,713 --> 00:28:07,681
Give him a break.

326
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:10,548
Luke?

327
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,460
I appreciate that.

328
00:28:15,917 --> 00:28:18,750
- It's good to see you, old man.
- You too.

329
00:28:21,078 --> 00:28:22,104
Rule No.1:

330
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:25,041
know your audience.

331
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:27,364
I gave you your shot,
you shit the bag.

332
00:28:27,676 --> 00:28:30,549
Now I'm gonna show you
how to get this done.

333
00:28:38,181 --> 00:28:40,506
- You're dead cop!
- Dead!

334
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:45,972
Well, well, well...

335
00:28:46,343 --> 00:28:49,649
Luke Hobbs behind bars.
Would you look at that?

336
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,797
The bad cop got it's day.

337
00:29:06,492 --> 00:29:07,656
That color looks good on you.

338
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:10,187
Yeah. Look a whole lot better
with your blood on it.

339
00:29:10,212 --> 00:29:12,215
Yeah. Good luck with that, Hercules.

340
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:14,359
Roaming gone bad. Huh?

341
00:29:15,112 --> 00:29:16,272
Such a cliche.

342
00:29:17,348 --> 00:29:19,031
Ah well.
Welcome to the club.

343
00:29:19,948 --> 00:29:21,488
I wouldn't get that twisted son.

344
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:23,723
We ain't in no club.
We got nothing in common.

345
00:29:23,793 --> 00:29:25,657
And unlike you,
I ain't gonna be here long.

346
00:29:25,857 --> 00:29:26,938
You put the shovel did you?

347
00:29:27,188 --> 00:29:29,385
Cause it's 38 feet of
steel and concrete.

348
00:29:30,161 --> 00:29:32,186
What's up big dog?

349
00:29:33,964 --> 00:29:34,844
Now you get to dig in.

350
00:29:37,368 --> 00:29:38,177
Wanker.

351
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,042
Move..

352
00:30:01,187 --> 00:30:02,107
Say that again.

353
00:30:03,283 --> 00:30:06,755
If I say it again,
It will be two corpse.

354
00:30:09,635 --> 00:30:11,546
I'm going to enjoy this.

355
00:30:11,746 --> 00:30:13,137
Welcome back, Dom.

356
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:14,829
Nice job out there.

357
00:30:16,532 --> 00:30:17,698
Excited about tonight?

358
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,540
Dom in this?

359
00:30:25,516 --> 00:30:26,647
You're with me now.

360
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:38,721
- Showing me your shoe collection?
- Yup.

361
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:44,602
A pair for every occasion.

362
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:47,735
There's enough guns here to
outfit a small army.

363
00:30:47,935 --> 00:30:50,205
Oh this is just the
tip of the iceberg.

364
00:30:53,611 --> 00:30:55,145
You know what I like about you, Dom.

365
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:56,530
You're a genuine outlaw.

366
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,115
I mean, you're a man who
lives by his own rules.

367
00:30:59,415 --> 00:31:03,152
Which was surprising because when I
saw you in Cuba, I heard about a

368
00:31:03,352 --> 00:31:05,909
guy who almost killed
you with a motorcycle and

369
00:31:05,982 --> 00:31:08,228
you.. let him keep his car?

370
00:31:08,428 --> 00:31:12,318
- That confused you.
- Oh.

371
00:31:13,264 --> 00:31:15,255
Of course I could've
taken his car.

372
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:18,101
It's about something bigger.

373
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:19,294
This way...

374
00:31:21,206 --> 00:31:22,767
I changed them.

375
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,400
That's not your responsibility.

376
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,865
- That's how I am.
- Is it?

377
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:30,143
Let me ask you something Dom,
what's the best thing in your life?

378
00:31:31,116 --> 00:31:33,175
- Family.
- No, it's not.

379
00:31:34,885 --> 00:31:36,353
Mind if you're being honest?

380
00:31:37,188 --> 00:31:38,937
It's the 10 seconds between

381
00:31:39,056 --> 00:31:42,092
start and finish, when you're not
thinking about anything.

382
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:46,152
No family,
not obligations, just you.

383
00:31:47,198 --> 00:31:48,358
And freedom.

384
00:31:53,484 --> 00:31:56,295
I gotta tell you. This whole
thing in the world...

385
00:31:56,365 --> 00:31:59,176
Robin Hood nonsense
you've been doing recently...

386
00:31:59,246 --> 00:32:02,145
It's bullshit. It's not you.

387
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:09,186
Be who you are.

388
00:32:09,586 --> 00:32:11,714
Why live only a quarter
mile at a time,

389
00:32:11,784 --> 00:32:14,314
when you can live your
whole life that way?

390
00:32:25,336 --> 00:32:27,063
Hey..!

391
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:30,139
Sure those muscles will give you.

392
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:32,175
All show and no..

393
00:32:46,124 --> 00:32:47,618
Well I got plenty of goal.

394
00:32:47,688 --> 00:32:49,113
You must have misplaced that.

395
00:32:49,183 --> 00:32:51,746
When I kicked your ass up in
that office of yours.

396
00:32:51,827 --> 00:32:53,188
Yeah.

397
00:32:54,365 --> 00:32:56,650
Just like you Brits,
rewriting History, huh?

398
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,136
All I know. It was not
me who was thrown out

399
00:32:59,336 --> 00:33:00,176
of a 4 storey window.

400
00:33:00,364 --> 00:33:03,306
Jumped.
I jumped out of a 4 storey window.

401
00:33:03,506 --> 00:33:05,008
Saving my partner's life.

402
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:06,355
Because where I'm from,

403
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:08,371
we don't settle fight
by throwing bombs.

404
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:10,251
Well, that's funny, because
where I'm from,

405
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:12,917
we don't need women
to run to the rescue.

406
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:16,176
Do you really believe you
could stand in front of me?

407
00:33:17,222 --> 00:33:19,349
And beat me in a straight up
old fashioned fist fight?

408
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:22,326
Let me tell you something.
Me and you...

409
00:33:22,396 --> 00:33:25,260
One on one, no one else around.

410
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:30,294
I will beat your ass
like a Cherokee drum.

411
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:34,526
Maybe one day we will find out.

412
00:33:34,726 --> 00:33:36,800
Oh, you better hope
that day never comes.

413
00:33:46,317 --> 00:33:48,150
I said no, Mr. Nobody.

414
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,184
I'm not leaving this cell.

415
00:33:50,684 --> 00:33:52,188
I'll get out my way.

416
00:33:53,191 --> 00:33:54,137
The right way.

417
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,278
- Get back to your cell.
- It's just a malfunction.

418
00:34:02,478 --> 00:34:04,201
- Get back!
- Just a malfunction.

419
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:19,149
Don't let him get away.

420
00:34:51,678 --> 00:34:52,766
Hobbs!

421
00:34:54,152 --> 00:34:56,143
I've been waiting a
long time for this.

422
00:34:57,188 --> 00:34:58,348
Keep waiting!

423
00:35:03,628 --> 00:35:06,195
Rubber bullets, big mistakes.

424
00:36:28,112 --> 00:36:30,239
Took longer than I expected.

425
00:36:32,283 --> 00:36:33,309
- 2 questions.
- Yeah.

426
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:35,308
- My daughter?
- With your sister.

427
00:36:36,287 --> 00:36:39,279
- Toretto?
- That's interesting you ask.

428
00:36:40,391 --> 00:36:41,927
This is my new base,

429
00:36:44,088 --> 00:36:45,430
Next level stuff for you.

430
00:36:46,931 --> 00:36:48,004
Listen, I don't wanna
talk to you about this,

431
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:49,915
Hey, listen guys. Thanks..

432
00:36:50,115 --> 00:36:52,024
Wow, handcuff. What is this?

433
00:36:52,224 --> 00:36:53,610
It's called the abuse of power.

434
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,392
You told me to round 'em up.

435
00:36:55,592 --> 00:36:56,974
I told you that...
hand..

436
00:36:57,174 --> 00:37:00,108
Cut 'em loose.
Oh man, this is embarrassing.

437
00:37:00,308 --> 00:37:02,177
I'm sorry guys, what do I have?

438
00:37:02,377 --> 00:37:04,247
This is how you treat old friends?

439
00:37:04,447 --> 00:37:04,947
Friend?

440
00:37:05,112 --> 00:37:07,514
We don't even really know
who the hell that guys is.

441
00:37:07,714 --> 00:37:10,116
It does not matter who I am,
As in like Nobody ok?

442
00:37:10,316 --> 00:37:11,012
Nobody, then who is he?

443
00:37:11,212 --> 00:37:12,956
He's nothing
he's like less than me.

444
00:37:13,156 --> 00:37:16,126
Clearly we're getting nowhere,
with nobody.

445
00:37:16,326 --> 00:37:19,143
I've been 4 hours here,
my ribs are sore.

446
00:37:19,343 --> 00:37:22,161
I don't know about y'all,
but I'm out.

447
00:37:23,334 --> 00:37:25,182
- I wouldn't recommend that.
- What?

448
00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:27,130
Well,
thanks to your past Berlin job.

449
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,169
You all made interpol's
top 10 most wanted list.

450
00:37:30,369 --> 00:37:33,143
Top 10? Uh-huh.
That's alright.

451
00:37:33,343 --> 00:37:35,145
Well, not you.

452
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:35,882
What do you mean?

453
00:37:35,952 --> 00:37:37,313
You just missed the cut,
you're number 11.

454
00:37:37,513 --> 00:37:39,913
- So.
- I missed it?

455
00:37:40,113 --> 00:37:42,112
- Yeah.
- That's impossible.

456
00:37:42,312 --> 00:37:44,311
What number did they come in at?

457
00:37:44,511 --> 00:37:47,323
Six, eight, nine...

458
00:37:47,523 --> 00:37:48,323
Ten.

459
00:37:49,293 --> 00:37:52,285
She's Ten? That's impossible,
there is no way she's 10.

460
00:37:52,485 --> 00:37:54,230
Oh, She's definitely 10.

461
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,532
How about we focus
on someone who

462
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:59,308
we're not gonna find out
in anybody's list.

463
00:37:59,508 --> 00:38:01,934
We are waiting hard
confirmation, but...

464
00:38:02,134 --> 00:38:06,075
I believe that's the cyber
terrorist known as Cipher.

465
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:08,337
Wait, no, Cipher's an organization.

466
00:38:08,537 --> 00:38:09,558
Not a person.

467
00:38:09,758 --> 00:38:10,947
Not according to our sources.

468
00:38:11,147 --> 00:38:13,531
- What does she want?
- I don't know.

469
00:38:13,731 --> 00:38:15,915
Cipher is like a digital active God.

470
00:38:16,115 --> 00:38:20,147
They, she, can manipulate
world systems under shadows.

471
00:38:20,247 --> 00:38:21,407
Anything that can be hacked..

472
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:22,927
And here is the kicker.

473
00:38:23,127 --> 00:38:25,054
You will never find her.
Linked to any other.

474
00:38:25,254 --> 00:38:28,587
Her digital identity is scrubbed
every few seconds worldwide.

475
00:38:28,896 --> 00:38:30,333
So basically, she
is the boogeyman.

476
00:38:30,403 --> 00:38:31,163
Yeah, she is.

477
00:38:31,363 --> 00:38:34,184
One of the hottest boogeyman
I have ever seen, I mean...

478
00:38:34,254 --> 00:38:37,174
If y'all know her, tell her
to get extra boy.

479
00:38:38,609 --> 00:38:40,243
- What are you, 12?
- That was my scene.

480
00:38:40,643 --> 00:38:41,880
Let's just say.

481
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,960
People are scared of the
hacker group Anonymous.

482
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,008
But even anonymous
won't mess with her.

483
00:38:46,033 --> 00:38:48,197
What the hell does any of this
have to do with us?

484
00:38:48,378 --> 00:38:49,932
Probably nothing, Letty.
But...

485
00:38:50,002 --> 00:38:52,695
I do find it interesting,
apparently for some reason.

486
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:54,927
She's now working with this guy.

487
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:14,277
He's already delivered a fully
operational EMP into her hands.

488
00:39:14,379 --> 00:39:15,261
Detonate that,

489
00:39:15,331 --> 00:39:18,544
they can turn any city in
the world into a war zone.

490
00:39:18,676 --> 00:39:21,164
So what is it that
you're suggesting?

491
00:39:21,189 --> 00:39:22,555
Maybe we find Dom huh?

492
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,797
Well, first let's catch him
and then figure out

493
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:27,750
- why he's turned.
- So you'all want us...

494
00:39:27,775 --> 00:39:28,883
To track Dom.

495
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,973
And I know Roman, I know
it's kinda a big job.

496
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:35,266
- It's impossible.
- Which is why...

497
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,454
I'm bringing in an
extra pair of hands.

498
00:39:43,193 --> 00:39:46,000
Ah. My day just got a
whole hell of a lot better.

499
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:48,187
Mr. Nobody you want to tell me
why you just put me in a room

500
00:39:48,212 --> 00:39:51,852
with this tin crumpled tin criminal,
some bitch.

501
00:39:51,877 --> 00:39:54,043
You got a big mouth
for a small head.

502
00:39:54,068 --> 00:39:56,305
Coming from prisoner 6753.

503
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:58,375
Don't think we've forgotten
everything that you've done.

504
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,070
We're not...
teaming up with this guy.

505
00:40:01,095 --> 00:40:02,002
Let's get one thing clear.

506
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:06,097
I ain't on your team.
I don't care about you, you crew...

507
00:40:06,122 --> 00:40:08,813
Your little family.
I'm here for Cipher.

508
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:10,863
You here to apply for a job,
asshole?

509
00:40:10,888 --> 00:40:12,249
You don't think that tight t-shirt

510
00:40:12,257 --> 00:40:13,900
is cutting off the
circulation to your brain.

511
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:15,164
You should get bigger size.

512
00:40:15,796 --> 00:40:18,000
Cipher came to me first.

513
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:19,376
Wanted me to steal
Nightshade for her.

514
00:40:19,446 --> 00:40:21,052
When I said no,
she went off to my brother.

515
00:40:21,122 --> 00:40:22,086
Oh Yes.

516
00:40:22,111 --> 00:40:24,477
Brother Owen who
could forget him?

517
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,007
Former hell-raiser
and current guest,

518
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,336
at a nasty little black site prison.

519
00:40:30,384 --> 00:40:32,420
Cipher corrupted him
left him for dead.

520
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:33,890
So if I get a shot to take her down,

521
00:40:33,916 --> 00:40:35,356
believe me, flicks
up, I'm taking it.

522
00:40:35,376 --> 00:40:36,719
You're taking my boot
right up your ass.

523
00:40:36,744 --> 00:40:39,906
Guys, guys, guys. The fastest way
to find Cipher is through Toretto.

524
00:40:39,931 --> 00:40:42,250
Now aside fromm myself,
there's only two men in the world,

525
00:40:42,419 --> 00:40:43,555
that have ever managed
to actually track him..

526
00:40:43,922 --> 00:40:45,875
Down with any success.
And guess what.

527
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,929
They're both standing in front
of me right now. So like it or not,

528
00:40:48,954 --> 00:40:51,091
you two are gonna work together.

529
00:40:51,861 --> 00:40:53,055
You got that?

530
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,301
I'll take that as a \x22yes.\x22.

531
00:40:58,399 --> 00:41:00,424
Am I the only one seeing this?

532
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,989
Oh, this oughtta be good.

533
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,617
Use God's eye?
We put our lives on the line..

534
00:41:08,642 --> 00:41:11,519
Running around the world
trying to figure this thing out.

535
00:41:11,544 --> 00:41:15,098
You can find anybody, right?
Let's use it to find Dom.

536
00:41:15,123 --> 00:41:18,151
Roman, that is a great idea.

537
00:41:19,236 --> 00:41:21,261
Did you hear that? Great idea.

538
00:41:22,106 --> 00:41:25,132
- And no, no! No pointing out.
- Mr. Nobody.

539
00:41:25,332 --> 00:41:26,336
Let's find it up.

540
00:41:37,154 --> 00:41:38,382
Got him. He's in London.

541
00:41:44,362 --> 00:41:48,196
Wait, we have got a
2nd match in Hong Kong.

542
00:41:49,233 --> 00:41:52,168
- And another in Seoul.
- In Tokyo.

543
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:57,107
And just about every other
major city on planet.

544
00:41:57,307 --> 00:42:00,035
And so God's eye is where we start.

545
00:42:00,235 --> 00:42:03,945
Cipher's already created an evasion.
Masked her location by..

546
00:42:04,145 --> 00:42:06,290
Pinging random spots
all over the globe.

547
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,175
But it was a good
thought Roman.

548
00:42:09,286 --> 00:42:11,080
So she's made my
programme obsolete.

549
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,278
And that Ramsey..

550
00:42:12,478 --> 00:42:15,190
- is why are you here.
- See, simple solutions...

551
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:16,630
aren't gonna cut it here slick.

552
00:42:18,796 --> 00:42:20,756
Why are you looking at me
when you're saying that?

553
00:42:20,803 --> 00:42:21,896
Wait a second, wait, wait.

554
00:42:21,996 --> 00:42:23,795
Simple solutions might just cut it.

555
00:42:24,071 --> 00:42:26,973
In order for God's eyes to
give up all this false pings,

556
00:42:27,327 --> 00:42:29,207
Means they have to
be using a free relay.

557
00:42:29,277 --> 00:42:30,264
Watch these two.

558
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,359
Which means it has a decaying
sync quantanizer.

559
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:33,941
Which we can reverse.

560
00:42:34,141 --> 00:42:36,452
And track it back to
the originating source

561
00:42:36,522 --> 00:42:38,172
and find Dom's true location.

562
00:42:41,116 --> 00:42:42,010
That was my idea.

563
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:44,344
That's what I was saying, remember?

564
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:45,915
Alright.
Let's try this.

565
00:42:57,168 --> 00:42:57,869
It's working..

566
00:42:58,157 --> 00:43:01,195
Now you wanna take your manual
and start organizing for response...

567
00:43:02,173 --> 00:43:03,231
Let's get a hold of
our internatio...

568
00:43:03,431 --> 00:43:04,939
He's still..

569
00:43:05,139 --> 00:43:06,910
Yes, like the first baby.

570
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,390
Yes, we're tracked his location.

571
00:43:08,471 --> 00:43:10,303
We wanna mobilize.

572
00:43:12,183 --> 00:43:17,177
Let's get a hold of a, better.
No one respects you, over.

573
00:43:17,277 --> 00:43:17,958
Get away from me.

574
00:43:19,156 --> 00:43:21,124
Alright they are not in China..

575
00:43:22,193 --> 00:43:25,321
- Or Russia.
- Europe's there.

576
00:43:27,198 --> 00:43:29,223
But this one's not going away.

577
00:43:30,234 --> 00:43:32,168
That's interesting.

578
00:43:33,204 --> 00:43:34,364
What?

579
00:43:35,406 --> 00:43:37,340
Because that's here.

580
00:44:21,342 --> 00:44:23,210
It scrambles your senses.

581
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,119
Don't worry,
It'll wear off in an hour.

582
00:44:27,091 --> 00:44:28,319
Probably.

583
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:32,220
Hello, Deckard.
Nice to see you again.

584
00:44:34,164 --> 00:44:37,032
Look at this,
bodies lying in pool Dom.

585
00:44:37,232 --> 00:44:40,101
Your family's already replacing you.

586
00:44:41,272 --> 00:44:44,041
You chose the loosing team.

587
00:44:44,241 --> 00:44:47,277
I guess your brother
is smarter than you.

588
00:45:21,178 --> 00:45:24,113
Smart move by putting God's eye
into the mainframe.

589
00:45:24,206 --> 00:45:25,817
Irritating to make me have to come

590
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,403
all the way down to get it, but.

591
00:45:31,121 --> 00:45:31,692
Nice gun.

592
00:45:39,096 --> 00:45:40,256
Dom!

593
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:51,878
You're gonna turn
your back on family?

594
00:45:51,948 --> 00:45:53,132
Just like that?

595
00:46:28,145 --> 00:46:29,339
Let's go.

596
00:47:02,746 --> 00:47:04,280
You okay?

597
00:47:07,351 --> 00:47:09,219
That wasn't him.

598
00:47:12,222 --> 00:47:14,349
I don't know what she's got on him.

599
00:47:15,259 --> 00:47:17,250
But that wasn't Dom.

600
00:47:18,295 --> 00:47:21,162
- Bryan would know what to do.
- No.

601
00:47:25,169 --> 00:47:27,364
We can't bring Bryan
and Mia into this.

602
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:30,163
We agreed on that.

603
00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:33,303
I know.

604
00:47:41,151 --> 00:47:42,742
Back there was that for her,

605
00:47:43,111 --> 00:47:45,536
for me, or you?

606
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:49,188
Or was it either necessary?

607
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,320
Necessary?

608
00:47:52,229 --> 00:47:55,323
Nothing is necessary.
Everything is a choice.

609
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,204
I simply made one but so did you.

610
00:47:58,776 --> 00:48:00,979
You could have stopped me,
but you chose not to do.

611
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,264
I wonder what Letty
thought about that.

612
00:48:05,409 --> 00:48:08,337
The problem of putting your foot
on a Tiger's neck...

613
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:09,987
is you can never let it up.

614
00:48:10,214 --> 00:48:13,942
I think I need to remind you
why you chose to be here.

615
00:48:49,653 --> 00:48:51,150
Dom.

616
00:48:58,162 --> 00:49:00,153
Sorry.

617
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:04,158
You shoudn't have come.

618
00:49:04,234 --> 00:49:06,131
Now they are going to get me away.

619
00:49:06,331 --> 00:49:08,200
Now she has the three of us.

620
00:49:14,644 --> 00:49:16,312
You wanna see him?

621
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:21,767
See papa.

622
00:49:29,693 --> 00:49:31,293
Papa.

623
00:49:41,138 --> 00:49:43,163
When I realized I was pregnant.

624
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:45,332
You had just find
out Letty was alive.

625
00:49:47,177 --> 00:49:50,203
So I decided when Letty and you
go back from your honeymoon.

626
00:49:50,314 --> 00:49:52,305
I was going to tell you.

627
00:49:54,786 --> 00:49:57,085
And then she took us
before I hugged the child.

628
00:50:06,788 --> 00:50:08,364
I call him Michaels.

629
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,259
That's a middle name.

630
00:50:13,203 --> 00:50:16,229
I thought his father should
give him first name.

631
00:50:26,116 --> 00:50:28,107
I'm sorry, Dom.

632
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,087
There is nothing to be sorry for.

633
00:50:34,242 --> 00:50:35,250
Whatever happens...

634
00:50:37,127 --> 00:50:39,186
Just save our son.

635
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,294
Your son.

636
00:50:59,152 --> 00:51:04,852


637
00:51:05,222 --> 00:51:06,222
Good visit?

638
00:51:09,259 --> 00:51:11,352
I know. I know what
you're thinking.

639
00:51:13,363 --> 00:51:15,242
I just let the guards go,

640
00:51:15,312 --> 00:51:17,671
so there is only two opponents
in the room.

641
00:51:17,871 --> 00:51:21,360
Rhodes has the gun, so you'll
take him out first, I know you.

642
00:51:22,306 --> 00:51:24,331
And then you're thinking.

643
00:51:24,374 --> 00:51:26,879
Elena is a cop,
maybe the two of you

644
00:51:26,949 --> 00:51:29,107
can fight your way out of here.

645
00:51:29,146 --> 00:51:31,307
So much to think about.

646
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,213
Let me make it easier for you.

647
00:51:45,295 --> 00:51:47,320
Do with it as you wish.

648
00:51:55,305 --> 00:51:58,138
Have you heard of choice theory Dom?

649
00:51:58,141 --> 00:51:59,521
There's a bunch of accidents,

650
00:51:59,591 --> 00:52:02,202
but only two you really need
to concern yourself with,

651
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:03,159
One.

652
00:52:03,444 --> 00:52:06,758
The only person's behavior
we can control is our own.

653
00:52:07,217 --> 00:52:10,718
And two, the only thing we
can truly give another person

654
00:52:10,788 --> 00:52:13,289
is information, so let me
give you some.

655
00:52:14,791 --> 00:52:16,842
You see this cameras in here?

656
00:52:17,661 --> 00:52:19,223
The moment you make a move,

657
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,941
highly paid men with weapons,

658
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:23,099
will make there way into this room.

659
00:52:23,133 --> 00:52:26,125
With one very specific instruction.

660
00:52:26,303 --> 00:52:29,170
It's not to save me.

661
00:52:29,806 --> 00:52:32,273
It's to kill your son.

662
00:52:33,143 --> 00:52:34,617
And that's a lot of bullets.

663
00:52:35,269 --> 00:52:38,113
And it only takes one
for you to loose everything.

664
00:52:38,117 --> 00:52:39,985
So, I have to ask you, because...

665
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:44,343
I know family is so
important to you.

666
00:52:47,124 --> 00:52:50,093
Is that really a choice
you wanna make?

667
00:52:53,196 --> 00:52:55,323
Because I'm ready as you are.

668
00:52:59,169 --> 00:53:02,138
I pull this trigger, and
God knows I wanna..

669
00:53:03,173 --> 00:53:05,368
I'll kill everyone on this plane...

670
00:53:06,109 --> 00:53:08,134
I still couldn't get in there.

671
00:53:09,146 --> 00:53:12,115
Because you could
manipulate this system.

672
00:53:12,682 --> 00:53:14,338
Since I'm alone!

673
00:53:17,154 --> 00:53:19,281
I got no choice!

674
00:53:28,131 --> 00:53:30,190
I don't think so.

675
00:54:01,164 --> 00:54:03,257
You want to see the old Dom?

676
00:54:05,768 --> 00:54:07,199
Watch.

677
00:54:25,322 --> 00:54:27,222
Damn it..

678
00:54:27,324 --> 00:54:30,225
She wiped it off.
Took God's eye.

679
00:54:30,727 --> 00:54:33,160
That was the one thing
we could use to find him.

680
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:35,264
We lost everything.

681
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,068
- Yeah, princess?
- Find him to rail.

682
00:54:41,271 --> 00:54:43,412
I've got couple of minutes to spare.

683
00:54:43,631 --> 00:54:46,494
If you want me to send
you to the hospital again.

684
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:49,269
- Yo Rules!
- First off,

685
00:54:49,279 --> 00:54:51,304
- That's not my name.
- Little nobody.

686
00:54:51,314 --> 00:54:53,248
- Don't call me that.
- Oh that's definitely stinky.

687
00:54:53,283 --> 00:54:55,658
Great do me a favor, and tell
your majesty over there,

688
00:54:55,728 --> 00:54:59,116
that we're gonna find Toretto.
We find Toretto together as a team.

689
00:54:59,122 --> 00:55:00,827
When this is all over,
y'all can have me to

690
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:02,698
slap that whickest biscuit
right off his face.

691
00:55:02,803 --> 00:55:03,604
Wait a minute, guys.

692
00:55:03,623 --> 00:55:05,159
I think Decker's
actually onto something.

693
00:55:05,162 --> 00:55:06,653
How do you think
Dom and Cipher got

694
00:55:06,723 --> 00:55:08,256
into the country
without us knowing?

695
00:55:09,299 --> 00:55:11,324
- Ghost flights.
- An untraceable aircraft

696
00:55:11,368 --> 00:55:13,421
it's all internet
conspiracy stuff.

697
00:55:13,491 --> 00:55:14,337
It's not.

698
00:55:14,537 --> 00:55:17,101
Satellites and radar grids...

699
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,165
All across the globe shift.

700
00:55:19,576 --> 00:55:23,144
Like an ocean. And they've got
channels that open and close.

701
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,307
And theoretically, if you
know the right people who...

702
00:55:25,315 --> 00:55:26,339
Know the right patterns.

703
00:55:26,383 --> 00:55:28,633
You can fly right through
the blind's box...

704
00:55:28,703 --> 00:55:29,816
can't be be intercepted.

705
00:55:30,016 --> 00:55:32,116
So you know where Dom is headed?

706
00:55:32,835 --> 00:55:35,147
Yeah, New York.

707
00:55:37,895 --> 00:55:38,761
You see that Elle..

708
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:41,228
You guys...
are gonna get along just great.

709
00:55:41,264 --> 00:55:44,358
Which proves, rule number two,
you never lose everything.

710
00:55:45,135 --> 00:55:46,376
Fire up the chopper.

711
00:55:46,755 --> 00:55:49,127
Guys, have a bowl
and a Big Apple.

712
00:56:12,195 --> 00:56:14,220
Why are we driving like this again?

713
00:56:14,264 --> 00:56:17,324
Because Dom took God's Eye,
so we need to stay off the grid.

714
00:56:18,235 --> 00:56:20,203
But like this?

715
00:56:23,206 --> 00:56:23,945
Hey.

716
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,134
So before I have to open my mouth...

717
00:56:26,334 --> 00:56:29,077
Let me ask you man,
what are we doing here?

718
00:56:29,112 --> 00:56:30,374
That's a good question, Roman.

719
00:56:31,815 --> 00:56:33,309
Let me show you.

720
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:40,118
Welcome to our new
base of operations.

721
00:56:40,223 --> 00:56:43,249
Now seriously,
what is this place?

722
00:56:43,593 --> 00:56:46,160
This... is heaven.

723
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:55,167
The agency garage.
We call it a toy shop.

724
00:57:02,512 --> 00:57:04,272
This is where we have every vehicles

725
00:57:04,342 --> 00:57:06,248
seized from drug
dealers of East coast.

726
00:57:06,649 --> 00:57:08,416
Now. Mr nobody said..

727
00:57:08,486 --> 00:57:10,446
If we're gonna have a chance
of catching Dom..

728
00:57:12,155 --> 00:57:14,248
We're gonna have to
be damn fast.

729
00:57:15,647 --> 00:57:16,880
Maybe this could help.

730
00:57:20,496 --> 00:57:24,155
We got a tank.
750 horsepower.

731
00:57:24,234 --> 00:57:28,102
6.6 liter V8 Duramax engine.

732
00:57:28,204 --> 00:57:32,231
With the M153 probe remotely
operated weapon station on top.

733
00:57:32,275 --> 00:57:34,334
You didn't get this
from drug dealers.

734
00:57:34,344 --> 00:57:36,750
No. No that...

735
00:57:37,241 --> 00:57:38,674
T96 army weaponry.

736
00:57:38,744 --> 00:57:40,452
See the army developing
machines like this

737
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:43,130
the soldiers could drive from a
mile way so they can stay safe.

738
00:57:43,286 --> 00:57:46,119
And alive. But luckily..

739
00:57:46,222 --> 00:57:49,789
There is a back up driver seat for
those of us who like to get war..

740
00:57:50,287 --> 00:57:51,381
Hands on.

741
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:54,454
I'm sitting there alone the whole
time when this thing feeling badly

742
00:57:54,524 --> 00:57:55,537
and she's getting fat.

743
00:57:56,266 --> 00:58:00,362
No one is getting hands on it.
She doesn't go on some streets.

744
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:07,275
I'm in love.

745
00:58:09,646 --> 00:58:13,305
Again? No. No...
That's a million dollar show car.

746
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:16,114
The point is to not draw attention.

747
00:58:16,152 --> 00:58:17,244
It's reverse psychology.

748
00:58:17,354 --> 00:58:19,185
Dom will never see it coming.

749
00:58:19,222 --> 00:58:20,382
It's neon orange,

750
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:23,359
The international space station
would see it coming.

751
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,848
Go choose anything less inspeculous.

752
00:58:26,918 --> 00:58:27,418
No no.

753
00:58:27,945 --> 00:58:31,223
This is ridiculous. Hey my man,
you can put that down right there.

754
00:58:31,534 --> 00:58:33,327
This is a gift. A real gift.

755
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:34,838
I know what you're doing.

756
00:58:35,872 --> 00:58:38,136
I like your beard.
You're blanta.

757
00:58:38,174 --> 00:58:40,142
Black santa?

758
00:58:41,144 --> 00:58:43,203
You know I'm serious.
Put it down right here..

759
00:59:10,706 --> 00:59:11,466
What are you doing?

760
00:59:12,108 --> 00:59:14,167
Engine mis-firing,
I gotta check it out.

761
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:16,235
No. That's not part
of the plan, Dom.

762
00:59:16,279 --> 00:59:17,177
Clearly..

763
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:20,206
But unless you want the engine
to cease on the job,

764
00:59:21,217 --> 00:59:23,151
You got five minutes.

765
00:59:35,098 --> 00:59:36,608
I want another visual.

766
00:59:44,274 --> 00:59:45,596
I got an ATM

767
00:59:57,853 --> 00:59:58,928
I don't like this.

768
01:00:12,702 --> 01:00:13,916
I want to see Toretto.

769
01:00:13,986 --> 01:00:15,200
There are no more cameras.

770
01:00:15,238 --> 01:00:16,313
Then find something.

771
01:00:16,413 --> 01:00:19,129
Punch in on something reflective
A car mirror, anything..

772
01:00:29,819 --> 01:00:33,111
- You know who I am?
- That's why I'm here.

773
01:00:33,323 --> 01:00:36,087
You know what I'm capable of.

774
01:00:37,227 --> 01:00:39,252
It's why I'm here.

775
01:00:40,163 --> 01:00:42,256
I'll give you until
I finish my cup up.

776
01:00:42,732 --> 01:00:45,096
And I'm.. thirsty.

777
01:00:46,135 --> 01:00:48,126
I'm not here to waste your time.

778
01:00:49,172 --> 01:00:50,332
Oh no.

779
01:00:50,373 --> 01:00:54,207
No, you've already taken everything
I have of value, Mr. Toretto,

780
01:00:54,210 --> 01:00:56,269
What more could you possibly want?

781
01:00:57,313 --> 01:00:59,338
To give you something back.

782
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:09,972
Talk to me.

783
01:01:13,229 --> 01:01:15,288
Something's not right here.

784
01:01:16,132 --> 01:01:18,259
First time I saw my son...

785
01:01:18,601 --> 01:01:21,099
It's behind a bulletproof glass.

786
01:01:21,337 --> 01:01:25,273
When he reached me,
I couldn't hold on.

787
01:01:26,376 --> 01:01:29,209
It's the worst pain
I ever felt..

788
01:01:30,146 --> 01:01:32,376
I know you know
exactly how it feels.

789
01:01:34,350 --> 01:01:37,114
Maybe we could change that..

790
01:01:37,587 --> 01:01:39,229
When I warned you, I think,

791
01:01:39,441 --> 01:01:43,277
you are about to suggest
something really dodgy Mr Toretto.

792
01:01:49,165 --> 01:01:51,224
It's why I'm here.

793
01:01:52,635 --> 01:01:55,136
Just punch in on something,
I'm not liking this.

794
01:01:55,171 --> 01:01:56,331
Something is not right.

795
01:01:56,604 --> 01:01:58,813
- Rhodes, you close?
- Yeah.

796
01:01:59,208 --> 01:02:02,143
- Good girl.
- The delivery truck's moving.

797
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,210
Captain Deckard Shaw,

798
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:40,181
distinguished himself
by acts of gallantry

799
01:02:40,183 --> 01:02:43,118
at the risk of his life above
and beyond the call of duty.

800
01:02:43,752 --> 01:02:47,279
His bold actions saved the lives of
hostages and his team mates.

801
01:02:48,090 --> 01:02:51,121
Recommendation: Victoria Cross.

802
01:02:51,594 --> 01:02:54,163
Highest honor the British Government
has ever given.

803
01:02:55,864 --> 01:02:56,656
To a traitor.

804
01:02:59,135 --> 01:03:01,228
Some about this old memory just
doesn't add up to me.

805
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:03,295
Then don't do the same
kind of funny math,

806
01:03:03,939 --> 01:03:08,174
It says a DSS agent who has a
soul to stop a valid stolen EMP.

807
01:03:08,177 --> 01:03:10,168
Sound familiar huh?

808
01:03:17,753 --> 01:03:19,218
Wanna give me a hand?

809
01:03:21,924 --> 01:03:23,058
- On three?
- Yeah.

810
01:03:23,238 --> 01:03:25,477
One two.. easy.

811
01:03:28,231 --> 01:03:30,221
You know, you can tell this in
another letter..

812
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:32,330
But maybe we could've caused
some serious damage.

813
01:03:33,136 --> 01:03:35,161
- Yes, we could.
- Yeah.

814
01:03:36,172 --> 01:03:37,455
Shame I'd have to punch you,

815
01:03:37,525 --> 01:03:39,266
head of defend,
when this is all over.

816
01:03:41,677 --> 01:03:44,078
Ah well.
With all due respect, Captain,

817
01:03:44,113 --> 01:03:46,138
When this whole thing is over
we're gonna find a location

818
01:03:46,182 --> 01:03:48,241
and I'm gonna knock your teeth
so far down your throat.

819
01:03:48,251 --> 01:03:51,118
You're gonna stick a toothbrush
right up in your toothbrush shelf.

820
01:03:58,461 --> 01:03:59,921
Get me God's eyes.

821
01:04:00,463 --> 01:04:02,856
- God's eye active.
- Thanks.

822
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:05,600
Let's find us some Russian.

823
01:04:05,868 --> 01:04:08,535
That spy is my little lie...

824
01:04:08,771 --> 01:04:11,540
Minister of defense.

825
01:04:28,509 --> 01:04:30,633
<i>We land back in Moscow by nine.</i>

826
01:04:30,861 --> 01:04:35,599
<i>Here's the latest defense report,
All the items in yesterday's meet.</i>

827
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:38,840
Upload this coordinates
to Dom's nav.

828
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:39,468
Copy that.

829
01:05:03,626 --> 01:05:05,560
He's in the third car.

830
01:05:06,162 --> 01:05:08,623
That's a guard class limousine.

831
01:05:22,578 --> 01:05:23,636
Where's my team?

832
01:05:24,013 --> 01:05:25,933
- Where's his team?
- There's no sign of 'em yet.

833
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,473
They are off the grid.

834
01:05:27,483 --> 01:05:29,474
Probably just bunker down somewhere.

835
01:05:29,518 --> 01:05:31,452
Closing in on him.

836
01:05:32,755 --> 01:05:33,622
You guys ready?

837
01:05:33,656 --> 01:05:35,647
One thing I can guarantee you Dom.

838
01:05:36,425 --> 01:05:38,416
No one's ready for this.

839
01:05:38,461 --> 01:05:40,491
I want every with
chip with the exploits

840
01:05:40,522 --> 01:05:43,093
in a two mile radius
around that motorcade now.

841
01:05:43,132 --> 01:05:44,453
There's over a thousands of them.

842
01:05:44,633 --> 01:05:46,198
Hack 'em all.

843
01:06:02,885 --> 01:06:04,250
It's zombie time.

844
01:06:12,495 --> 01:06:14,720
I'd buckle up if I were you.

845
01:06:15,326 --> 01:06:16,166
<i>AUTO-DRIVE ACTIVATED.</i>

846
01:07:16,792 --> 01:07:17,850
Sorry.

847
01:07:26,068 --> 01:07:27,836
Target the motorcade.

848
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:39,843
And here they come.

849
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:45,812
<i>What is going on?</i>

850
01:07:46,822 --> 01:07:48,653
Ouch.

851
01:07:51,051 --> 01:07:52,054
<i>Drive fast!</i>

852
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:58,718
Police escort down..

853
01:07:59,335 --> 01:08:01,762
Take out the lead and follow cars.

854
01:08:17,432 --> 01:08:18,708
<i>Drive! Drive!</i>

855
01:08:28,864 --> 01:08:30,172
Two more down.

856
01:08:30,515 --> 01:08:33,703
<i>There's more cars ahead of us.
Shoot their engines.</i>

857
01:08:41,919 --> 01:08:42,799
<i>Oh God!</i>

858
01:08:56,658 --> 01:08:58,717
We got locked cars in cyber shock...

859
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,077
Send backup! Send S.W.A.T!

860
01:09:00,147 --> 01:09:02,172
And take yourself a
goddamn boy scout...

861
01:09:02,362 --> 01:09:05,565
- Just send us some help!
- Now that's Dom.

862
01:09:10,735 --> 01:09:12,065
<i>Faster, faster!</i>

863
01:09:33,762 --> 01:09:35,662
The motorcade has turned on 7th.

864
01:09:35,697 --> 01:09:37,756
Perfect. Make it rain.

865
01:10:35,724 --> 01:10:37,589
Target immobilized.

866
01:10:38,594 --> 01:10:39,720
Your turn.

867
01:10:53,684 --> 01:10:56,474
<i>- Who the hell is that?
- What is he doing?</i>

868
01:10:59,786 --> 01:11:01,203
<i>What the hell
are you waiting for?</i>

869
01:11:01,353 --> 01:11:02,593
<i>Shoot him!</i>

870
01:11:03,438 --> 01:11:04,933
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

871
01:11:13,883 --> 01:11:14,664
<i>I'm out.</i>

872
01:11:17,170 --> 01:11:17,494
<i>Shit.</i>

873
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:19,940
<i>Don't worry sir.
This car is bulletproof.</i>

874
01:11:20,219 --> 01:11:21,799
<i>You'll be safe in here.</i>

875
01:11:25,807 --> 01:11:28,227
<i>- Give me the case.
- Give him the case.</i>

876
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:31,912
<i>These are nuclear launch codes.
We cannot give it to him.</i>

877
01:11:37,306 --> 01:11:38,543
<i>What is he doing now?</i>

878
01:11:55,711 --> 01:11:57,626
<i>He just cut a hole
in our gas tank.</i>

879
01:12:24,366 --> 01:12:26,566
Good work, Dom.

880
01:12:26,768 --> 01:12:28,011
Meet you at the pick-up.

881
01:12:38,543 --> 01:12:40,285
I think I know
where my team's at.

882
01:12:40,682 --> 01:12:43,617
- Where?
- Right in front of me.

883
01:12:55,263 --> 01:12:58,663
This is on you.
Get out of there, Dom.

884
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,202
Guys, I know why Dom's here.

885
01:13:00,704 --> 01:13:03,389
Police scanners are saying
he's stolen Nuclear Football.

886
01:13:06,942 --> 01:13:10,269
It's over, Toretto.
Get your.. out of the door now.

887
01:13:17,285 --> 01:13:18,525
That's how you wanna play this?

888
01:13:19,287 --> 01:13:20,355
Let's play.

889
01:13:26,695 --> 01:13:28,220
Don't do this, Dom.

890
01:13:31,733 --> 01:13:33,098
He's stomped foot.

891
01:13:33,802 --> 01:13:35,332
- What're you doing?
- It's a trap!

892
01:14:00,462 --> 01:14:03,025
Now I know what it feels like
be every cop ever chasing us.

893
01:14:03,112 --> 01:14:04,616
I'm gonna get a
little close enough.

894
01:14:04,686 --> 01:14:06,233
Oh, so you just gonna take Dom?

895
01:14:06,835 --> 01:14:10,103
Little Nobody has clearly
lost his little mind.

896
01:14:22,451 --> 01:14:23,209
I'm on him.

897
01:14:23,252 --> 01:14:25,152
Easy, work together.

898
01:14:33,762 --> 01:14:35,632
- No, no.
- Wait, wait, wait!

899
01:14:37,532 --> 01:14:38,332
Oh shit.

900
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:46,528
I will take the short cut.

901
01:14:59,754 --> 01:15:01,264
The path!
Watch these people.

902
01:15:02,822 --> 01:15:04,196
Mr. Sexy coming through!

903
01:15:33,722 --> 01:15:35,102
Not this time, Dom.

904
01:16:34,516 --> 01:16:36,114
Stretch him out.
Hold them.

905
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:06,314
He gotta have about
2000 Horse Power in that thing.

906
01:17:06,948 --> 01:17:08,213
Try 3000..

907
01:17:12,053 --> 01:17:13,287
Try Five.

908
01:17:21,847 --> 01:17:22,709
Get out of there.

909
01:17:22,909 --> 01:17:24,166
I'm working on it.

910
01:17:24,266 --> 01:17:26,128
Stop working on it, and do it..

911
01:17:38,179 --> 01:17:40,348
No, no no...
It's my Bentley.

912
01:17:50,925 --> 01:17:51,672
No!

913
01:18:19,921 --> 01:18:22,913
Take that case and run!

914
01:18:34,502 --> 01:18:35,828
Move!

915
01:18:41,843 --> 01:18:43,723
They thought...
this was gonna be a streetfight.

916
01:18:44,002 --> 01:18:45,913
You can wait for it Torretto.

917
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:49,167
No!

918
01:19:01,963 --> 01:19:03,863
Letty, stop!

919
01:19:08,403 --> 01:19:09,931
What are you gonna do?

920
01:19:22,484 --> 01:19:26,948
I don't know why you're doing this,
but I know one thing.

921
01:19:27,822 --> 01:19:29,790
You love me.

922
01:19:33,761 --> 01:19:35,956
And you're not gonna to shoot me.

923
01:19:47,209 --> 01:19:50,570
You should've given him the case,
cause I won't chase you.

924
01:19:52,814 --> 01:19:53,940
Okay.

925
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:56,514
I will just take it
from a dead girl.

926
01:19:58,486 --> 01:20:00,720
You willing to die for it?

927
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:19,804
Let's go then.

928
01:20:41,228 --> 01:20:42,691
Anything?

929
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:44,761
They're gone.

930
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:48,092
And D.O.D confirmed
it was a nuclear football.

931
01:20:48,336 --> 01:20:51,796
He's got an EMP and
nuclear launch codes.

932
01:20:51,839 --> 01:20:53,321
I don't know what it is,

933
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:55,798
but they're building
towards something.

934
01:20:55,843 --> 01:20:57,708
Deckard?

935
01:20:58,780 --> 01:20:59,697
He didn't make it.

936
01:21:21,236 --> 01:21:22,944
I'm disappointed in you, Dom.

937
01:21:24,822 --> 01:21:27,730
You'd have Letty just walk
away with the codes.

938
01:21:27,742 --> 01:21:30,711
- You've got the codes!
- Rhodes got the codes.

939
01:21:30,745 --> 01:21:33,771
You made the choice
to let her go.

940
01:21:34,849 --> 01:21:36,908
And now I have to make
one on my own.

941
01:21:48,863 --> 01:21:53,132
They are adorable little things,
aren't they?

942
01:21:53,568 --> 01:21:55,227
I hope I don't hurt him.

943
01:21:59,841 --> 01:22:03,141
Look, Cipher, I did exactly
what you asked me to do.

944
01:22:03,711 --> 01:22:04,824
Don't do this.

945
01:22:05,024 --> 01:22:08,247
- This is your doing.
- My doing?

946
01:22:17,525 --> 01:22:19,250
Please don't hurt him.
I'm begging you.

947
01:22:19,261 --> 01:22:22,059
I don't want you to beg.

948
01:22:24,466 --> 01:22:27,663
- I want you to learn.
- Learn what?

949
01:22:28,603 --> 01:22:33,563
I understand why you did
what you did. I really do.

950
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,648
But it was the wrong choice.

951
01:22:41,949 --> 01:22:44,618
This is a consequence, Dom.

952
01:22:46,020 --> 01:22:48,555
No! No! No...

953
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:51,517
Wait. Wait.

954
01:22:51,593 --> 01:22:53,458
Don't you do it!

955
01:22:53,528 --> 01:22:55,519
No!

956
01:23:22,056 --> 01:23:25,422
Can you pull up the footage
of the guy in the ally.

957
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:27,655
- Traffic cams.
- I got you.

958
01:23:32,033 --> 01:23:35,535
I knew it.
I recognize that guy.

959
01:23:35,603 --> 01:23:37,068
That's Connor Rhodes.

960
01:23:37,138 --> 01:23:39,333
I met him when I was working
with Shaw's brother.

961
01:23:40,274 --> 01:23:42,275
He wanted us to get the
Nightshade device him.

962
01:23:43,010 --> 01:23:44,141
Connor Rhodes.

963
01:23:44,912 --> 01:23:47,779
He's also linked to some
who I like to be dead.

964
01:23:47,815 --> 01:23:48,975
Mose Jakande.

965
01:23:49,817 --> 01:23:51,842
Warlord who tried to get God's eye.

966
01:23:51,853 --> 01:23:55,187
Which means that's twice that
Dom has messed up Cipher's business.

967
01:24:07,969 --> 01:24:10,646
Everything you're feeling right now,

968
01:24:10,716 --> 01:24:13,839
that's rage, sense of loss.
It's not real.

969
01:24:14,109 --> 01:24:18,001
It's the survival instinct wired
deep into our brains.

970
01:24:18,202 --> 01:24:21,806
To ensure continuation of species.

971
01:24:21,916 --> 01:24:24,743
When early men went visit
a watering hole...

972
01:24:25,753 --> 01:24:30,884
If they didn't watch their child,
they get snatched by a crocodile.

973
01:24:31,025 --> 01:24:37,831
Your brains would create a painful
but a structural memory.

974
01:24:38,566 --> 01:24:40,893
So it will never happen again.

975
01:24:42,737 --> 01:24:45,865
This idea of family
that is so core with you,

976
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:47,898
that rules your world...

977
01:24:48,910 --> 01:24:51,811
It's a biological lie.

978
01:24:52,847 --> 01:24:54,906
You don't have to accept it.

979
01:24:56,851 --> 01:24:58,109
I don't!

980
01:25:00,922 --> 01:25:04,010
Did you really could think
you could destroy two of my teams.

981
01:25:04,225 --> 01:25:05,953
Without any repercussions?

982
01:25:06,861 --> 01:25:09,107
I wouldn't have even
looked your way..

983
01:25:09,177 --> 01:25:10,695
If you hadn't done that.

984
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:12,892
You didn't even know you had a kid.

985
01:25:13,868 --> 01:25:15,259
You can thank me for that.

986
01:25:15,329 --> 01:25:17,736
And start doing the job
I'm asking you to do.

987
01:25:17,738 --> 01:25:18,932
Help you start a war.

988
01:25:18,973 --> 01:25:20,941
Is that what you think I want.

989
01:25:23,778 --> 01:25:25,837
That's so limited.

990
01:25:26,814 --> 01:25:28,907
I didn't take that
football to start a war..

991
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:31,885
Anymore than I took your son
to start a family.

992
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:34,779
Taking your son got me the codes..

993
01:25:34,822 --> 01:25:36,733
The codes will get me the nukes,

994
01:25:36,803 --> 01:25:39,191
and the nukes will
get me what I want...

995
01:25:39,327 --> 01:25:43,959
Today, tomorrow...
and every day after that.

996
01:25:43,998 --> 01:25:45,863
What's that?

997
01:25:47,568 --> 01:25:49,702
Accountability.

998
01:25:51,506 --> 01:25:53,867
The second I fire off
one of those nukes..

999
01:25:53,874 --> 01:25:56,843
I put the superpowers of this world
on notice that...

1000
01:25:56,877 --> 01:25:58,902
...when they cross line,

1001
01:26:01,282 --> 01:26:04,782
...I'm gonna be there
to hold the responsible..

1002
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,847
Because the truth is, Dom...

1003
01:26:07,888 --> 01:26:09,947
...To the world out there...

1004
01:26:12,727 --> 01:26:15,787
...I'm the crocodile
at the watering hole.

1005
01:26:21,436 --> 01:26:23,219
You've got one last job to do.

1006
01:26:24,905 --> 01:26:26,805
Cipher..

1007
01:26:35,883 --> 01:26:38,852
If I were you,
I would kiss my son.

1008
01:26:40,921 --> 01:26:44,541
Because whether you value it or not,
all of this...

1009
01:26:45,793 --> 01:26:48,653
Your plane, your security and you...

1010
01:26:49,997 --> 01:26:52,431
...are still on this
earth because of him.

1011
01:26:57,972 --> 01:26:59,533
The problem we have
with tracking Cipher

1012
01:26:59,573 --> 01:27:00,907
is there's nothing to trace then.

1013
01:27:00,908 --> 01:27:02,345
Now we have trace information.

1014
01:27:02,657 --> 01:27:04,372
And we're getting
snapshots of this data

1015
01:27:04,442 --> 01:27:05,938
before it's scrubbed off the net.

1016
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:08,551
How do you erase someone's
bank accounts? Always just...

1017
01:27:08,849 --> 01:27:10,678
The Longitude.

1018
01:27:10,785 --> 01:27:12,946
Given the fact that Dom
hit the Russian Motorcade

1019
01:27:12,987 --> 01:27:15,922
safe to say it's Russia.
Go ahead, bring up the map.

1020
01:27:16,591 --> 01:27:18,609
Great, let's start here
run the possibilities.

1021
01:27:19,727 --> 01:27:21,834
Yalta, Poltava.

1022
01:27:22,034 --> 01:27:23,754
Looks like they just threw
letters together.

1023
01:27:23,931 --> 01:27:26,042
- Konyert.
- It's Vladupi.

1024
01:27:26,242 --> 01:27:27,202
What are you doing here?

1025
01:27:28,068 --> 01:27:30,094
Thought I was gonna check in on you
from time to time,

1026
01:27:30,179 --> 01:27:31,194
To see you how you're doing.

1027
01:27:31,264 --> 01:27:32,937
By the way, not so hot.

1028
01:27:33,137 --> 01:27:35,703
But there's nothing in Vladiven.
It's just ice..

1029
01:27:35,803 --> 01:27:36,824
That why...

1030
01:27:37,312 --> 01:27:39,309
Could've sworn there was a
secret Russian naval base

1031
01:27:39,323 --> 01:27:41,142
with the retrophilic
cold war Submarines.

1032
01:27:41,716 --> 01:27:43,877
Well, technically,
it's not Russian anymore.

1033
01:27:44,263 --> 01:27:46,863
Base was take by a terror grope
of military separatists

1034
01:27:46,912 --> 01:27:49,193
about a month ago. And the
Russians haven't taken it back.

1035
01:27:49,357 --> 01:27:51,884
So there is a little
window of opportunity.

1036
01:27:51,926 --> 01:27:54,088
Russia made submarines,
nuclear football,

1037
01:27:54,362 --> 01:27:57,888
it sounds like everything we do
our legs gonna be bombed off.

1038
01:27:57,898 --> 01:28:00,958
Sounds like you're still
a No. 11 on the list.

1039
01:28:01,769 --> 01:28:03,984
It sounds like you've changed
since you look funky.

1040
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:05,526
Facial hairs and came in.

1041
01:28:05,694 --> 01:28:07,478
Guys... guys. Hey.

1042
01:28:07,526 --> 01:28:09,108
We gotta call this in
all the way up the chain.

1043
01:28:09,178 --> 01:28:10,278
That's good thinking champ.

1044
01:28:10,478 --> 01:28:14,141
Except unfortunately the
Russian Minister of Defense.

1045
01:28:14,349 --> 01:28:17,037
Got himself involved in little
incident on US territory

1046
01:28:17,385 --> 01:28:19,305
and two governments
aren't talking to each other.

1047
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,000
By the time they do...
It will be too late.

1048
01:28:21,159 --> 01:28:22,523
So, any other suggestions?

1049
01:28:23,358 --> 01:28:25,519
Yeah, I got one.

1050
01:28:26,361 --> 01:28:28,329
How about we just
stop them ourselves?

1051
01:28:28,396 --> 01:28:30,455
You're talking about a
Russian Military Base.

1052
01:28:30,498 --> 01:28:31,430
Separatists.

1053
01:28:31,432 --> 01:28:32,804
Whatever. It's suicide.

1054
01:28:33,004 --> 01:28:34,534
It's stopping world war 3.

1055
01:28:36,503 --> 01:28:37,768
What's it gonna be rook?

1056
01:28:37,805 --> 01:28:39,864
You're gonna close your eyes
on this one too?

1057
01:28:39,907 --> 01:28:41,191
Pray that the apocalypse

1058
01:28:41,261 --> 01:28:43,775
doesn't come knocking on
your mama's front door?

1059
01:28:43,778 --> 01:28:45,785
Or are you're gonna saddle up,

1060
01:28:45,855 --> 01:28:48,599
be a man and save the
entire goddamn world

1061
01:28:54,789 --> 01:28:57,724
I know, thank god
they read it out.

1062
01:28:57,825 --> 01:28:58,792
What's that?

1063
01:28:58,826 --> 01:29:00,786
- Rule number three.
- Which is?

1064
01:29:02,096 --> 01:29:03,188
There are no rules.

1065
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:07,100
What did I told you, Luke?

1066
01:29:07,568 --> 01:29:08,702
I knew he'd get in three.

1067
01:29:08,902 --> 01:29:10,263
Areal transport leaves in an hour.

1068
01:29:10,538 --> 01:29:12,138
Take whatever vehicle you want.

1069
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:14,819
- All bets are off.
- Bets are off?

1070
01:29:15,019 --> 01:29:16,207
<i>See you later...</i>

1071
01:29:36,931 --> 01:29:38,990
I got an nuclear attack submarine.

1072
01:29:42,069 --> 01:29:43,992
Letty I don't like telling
you this one thing,

1073
01:29:44,478 --> 01:29:45,745
but the game's changed.

1074
01:29:46,106 --> 01:29:48,245
Before we were trying
just to catch Dom,

1075
01:29:48,315 --> 01:29:49,906
but now after all of this...

1076
01:29:49,910 --> 01:29:51,935
I want you to know,
if I have to...

1077
01:29:52,980 --> 01:29:54,914
I'm gonna put him down..

1078
01:29:56,984 --> 01:29:59,885
Then you might have to
take us both down.

1079
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:03,846
This ain't right, man.
This ain't funny.

1080
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:05,721
I come from a different
kind of lifestyle.

1081
01:30:08,062 --> 01:30:12,055
Ladies know me.
They know where I'm at with.

1082
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:17,002
I try to take a piss,
I ain't even recognize myself.

1083
01:30:17,037 --> 01:30:19,536
That's entirely too
much information.

1084
01:30:19,606 --> 01:30:21,064
I'm just saying.

1085
01:30:21,075 --> 01:30:23,942
Well, one thing is for sure.

1086
01:30:23,978 --> 01:30:26,334
Dom's gotta be either working
with them or making a train

1087
01:30:26,434 --> 01:30:29,940
cause no one will be this insane
to hit this place in a damn army.

1088
01:30:30,884 --> 01:30:32,205
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

1089
01:30:34,088 --> 01:30:35,292
Speak of the Dom.

1090
01:30:43,497 --> 01:30:46,895
Alright, Dom, you're one step
closer to that family reunion.

1091
01:30:47,095 --> 01:30:48,035
400 meters to base.

1092
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:51,128
Prep the EMP.
Let's take these defenses down.

1093
01:31:02,628 --> 01:31:05,049
<i>We have a possible
threat incoming.</i>

1094
01:31:05,119 --> 01:31:07,264
<i>Raise the barricade, quick.</i>

1095
01:31:24,628 --> 01:31:27,041
<i>We've lost power,
get to your positions now.</i>

1096
01:31:28,342 --> 01:31:31,236
Gates are open.
Let's get this party started.

1097
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:48,661
- EMP's are charging.
- How long?

1098
01:31:48,964 --> 01:31:49,923
60 seconds.

1099
01:31:51,164 --> 01:31:53,358
Alright, Dom,
you've one pulse left in that EMP.

1100
01:31:54,102 --> 01:31:55,758
That sub is heavily insulated.

1101
01:31:55,828 --> 01:31:58,348
You're gonna need to be right
underneath it, or this won't work.

1102
01:32:23,058 --> 01:32:23,923
Come on.

1103
01:32:24,090 --> 01:32:25,570
<i>Engaging target.
He's beneath the Sub.</i>

1104
01:32:32,684 --> 01:32:35,381
<i>I'm loosing control,
mayday, mayday.</i>

1105
01:32:41,515 --> 01:32:43,989
Yes, two birds with one stone.

1106
01:32:44,189 --> 01:32:45,349
We've got control of the sub.

1107
01:32:45,519 --> 01:32:46,649
Dom, we are good.

1108
01:32:46,987 --> 01:32:49,185
Head over to the Rendezvous.
Ok Matty...

1109
01:32:49,223 --> 01:32:51,248
...Let's take this baby for a spin.

1110
01:32:56,264 --> 01:32:57,322
Damn!

1111
01:32:58,298 --> 01:33:01,664
I think Cipher just rebooted
Sub's command system.

1112
01:33:01,669 --> 01:33:02,693
What the hell is he talking about?

1113
01:33:02,736 --> 01:33:04,601
In terms...

1114
01:33:04,738 --> 01:33:06,831
She just carjacked a submarine.

1115
01:33:08,709 --> 01:33:11,803
We can't let it get away.
That's the control room.

1116
01:33:12,446 --> 01:33:13,886
If you can get me
into that row house

1117
01:33:14,215 --> 01:33:16,391
I can tap with network
and counter hack Cipher.

1118
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:17,810
Keep it from flowing into water.

1119
01:33:17,851 --> 01:33:19,879
No, what we need to do is
get me on that sub.

1120
01:33:20,354 --> 01:33:21,848
I find the weapon's room
and I can pull the lunch chip

1121
01:33:21,889 --> 01:33:23,789
before she can fire
any of those nukes.

1122
01:33:23,824 --> 01:33:24,756
That is too crazy.

1123
01:33:25,359 --> 01:33:27,389
- Just think it's too dangerous.
- We'll do both.

1124
01:33:51,852 --> 01:33:52,861
Knock, knock!

1125
01:33:58,158 --> 01:33:59,871
Five vehicles just reached the base.

1126
01:34:00,494 --> 01:34:02,172
They just don't give up, do they..

1127
01:34:11,104 --> 01:34:13,796
Come on, let's move, team.
Double time, double time.

1128
01:34:21,449 --> 01:34:22,880
Letty, let's go.

1129
01:35:02,756 --> 01:35:04,017
Change of plans, Dom.

1130
01:35:04,221 --> 01:35:06,555
I'm sending you the co-ordinates,
head there immediately.

1131
01:35:06,755 --> 01:35:09,787
- I'm done. I want my son.
- I'll tell you when you're done.

1132
01:35:09,797 --> 01:35:13,699
Your team is in play, now leave road
and follow my instruction.

1133
01:35:19,673 --> 01:35:20,833
Go! Go!

1134
01:35:23,610 --> 01:35:26,636
Move, move!
Get out of here, go go!

1135
01:35:33,987 --> 01:35:36,770
Ok, how do you like this?

1136
01:35:38,859 --> 01:35:41,640
- Remote link has been separated.
- I'll take care of this.

1137
01:35:45,699 --> 01:35:47,193
Hi Ramsey.

1138
01:35:50,838 --> 01:35:52,140
She's regaining control.

1139
01:35:52,694 --> 01:35:53,627
I mean she's good.

1140
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:36,804
They are entering
the Weapon's stream.

1141
01:36:36,874 --> 01:36:37,876
Oh that's cute.

1142
01:36:43,790 --> 01:36:47,567
Go, pull pull!
Roman, guard by the chip, c'mon.

1143
01:36:51,665 --> 01:36:54,409
Oh she's sick.
Gonna have to do better in that way.

1144
01:36:56,490 --> 01:36:58,412
Ok,
now you're starting to piss me off.

1145
01:37:13,738 --> 01:37:15,856
Ramsey,
how much time we talking to you?

1146
01:37:16,590 --> 01:37:19,821
You're smart,
but no smart enough.

1147
01:37:22,829 --> 01:37:23,905
She's locked me out.

1148
01:37:27,601 --> 01:37:30,314
Tej, I can't stop. Now
you're gonna have to pull that chip.

1149
01:37:30,371 --> 01:37:32,133
I can't.
This thing's going into attack mode.

1150
01:37:32,344 --> 01:37:34,453
The door's not gonna open
until you pull the chip.

1151
01:37:35,709 --> 01:37:38,803
Tej we got no idea what the hell
we are looking for.

1152
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:40,840
I got it.

1153
01:37:44,017 --> 01:37:46,686
What in the hell are you guys doing?

1154
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:49,618
It wasn't me, okay?

1155
01:37:49,656 --> 01:37:50,936
It will be labeled
Guardians Go.

1156
01:37:51,858 --> 01:37:53,792
- Ok. I got something.
- What?

1157
01:37:53,794 --> 01:37:57,186
It says haha.. slack
slack back

1158
01:37:57,385 --> 01:38:00,258
...smoke, dear jack
na jack.

1159
01:38:00,434 --> 01:38:01,732
Do you understand that?

1160
01:38:26,594 --> 01:38:28,106
Oh yeah, that's sick.

1161
01:38:41,775 --> 01:38:43,640
Quite a show.

1162
01:38:46,412 --> 01:38:47,746
Arming the nuke..

1163
01:38:52,754 --> 01:38:54,936
Nuke's going hot,
she's trying to fire this thing.

1164
01:38:55,136 --> 01:38:57,377
- Roger that, we're moving out.
- Disable that chip, now.

1165
01:38:57,453 --> 01:38:58,156
Roman, what are you seeing?

1166
01:38:58,192 --> 01:39:00,473
- Come on, Talk to me.
- I don't see shit. I'm holding on.

1167
01:39:02,163 --> 01:39:03,323
Now we're on countdown.

1168
01:39:07,358 --> 01:39:08,971
What the hell is going on man?

1169
01:39:09,203 --> 01:39:12,138
We are about to launch a nuclear
missile, what the hell is going on.

1170
01:39:12,139 --> 01:39:13,265
Pull the damn chip.

1171
01:39:16,577 --> 01:39:19,078
Countdown. Countdown.
Look for a countdown.

1172
01:39:19,113 --> 01:39:20,102
What countdown?

1173
01:39:20,114 --> 01:39:22,082
The missile needs to
activate for launch.

1174
01:39:22,149 --> 01:39:24,333
The countdown timer
won't be in Russian.

1175
01:39:24,403 --> 01:39:25,243
Countdown.

1176
01:39:25,691 --> 01:39:27,795
Show 'em what we could.

1177
01:39:29,089 --> 01:39:30,283
No. No. No.
Press that.

1178
01:39:33,394 --> 01:39:34,320
I got it.

1179
01:39:36,163 --> 01:39:38,222
Something is wrong. It won't launch.

1180
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:41,225
Get that sub out of there.

1181
01:39:41,768 --> 01:39:43,099
Now!

1182
01:39:44,305 --> 01:39:46,239
Roman.

1183
01:39:54,348 --> 01:39:55,172
You alright?

1184
01:39:55,216 --> 01:39:58,110
There's nothing alright
about any of this. Let's go.

1185
01:39:58,310 --> 01:39:59,285
What about the missiles?

1186
01:40:00,487 --> 01:40:02,314
We got the chip,
no nukes for her.

1187
01:40:02,823 --> 01:40:05,121
Well done. Let's go.

1188
01:40:08,829 --> 01:40:11,822
Guys we got company.
A lot of company.

1189
01:40:16,569 --> 01:40:17,673
Alright team, here is the plan.

1190
01:40:17,771 --> 01:40:19,853
There is a Sea lock
at the opening of the bay,

1191
01:40:20,053 --> 01:40:21,158
We get there first, and close it,

1192
01:40:21,258 --> 01:40:24,028
we can stop the submarine
from escaping into open water.

1193
01:40:24,228 --> 01:40:25,351
And disappearing forever.

1194
01:40:27,160 --> 01:40:29,884
I've got the location.
It's 10 miles south west.

1195
01:40:30,384 --> 01:40:32,724
10 miles?
Like I make it in 10 seconds.

1196
01:40:43,630 --> 01:40:46,063
What's the matter Roman,
you forgot the snow time?

1197
01:40:48,101 --> 01:40:49,569
Loving that Lambo now?

1198
01:40:59,969 --> 01:41:02,253
Alright everyone, hold you
over that launch trip later.

1199
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:03,381
Right now I want that sub,

1200
01:41:03,451 --> 01:41:05,012
beneath water,
where no one can find it.

1201
01:41:05,037 --> 01:41:06,891
Find me the fastest
route out of that bay.

1202
01:41:06,961 --> 01:41:07,639
Copy that.

1203
01:41:17,548 --> 01:41:19,040
Why are they shooting at me?

1204
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:21,233
I think off you're in that
orange Lamborghini I don't know.

1205
01:41:21,236 --> 01:41:23,022
Shut up Tez.

1206
01:41:28,375 --> 01:41:28,715
Go on.

1207
01:41:28,785 --> 01:41:31,111
Do you really wanna
put that car in gear?

1208
01:41:33,380 --> 01:41:34,273
Do you?

1209
01:41:38,337 --> 01:41:39,525
I don't think so.

1210
01:41:39,725 --> 01:41:40,763
They're heading for the sea lock.

1211
01:41:40,833 --> 01:41:42,091
They're trying to trap
the sub in a bay.

1212
01:41:42,291 --> 01:41:44,636
I should have taken care of this
a long time ago.

1213
01:41:45,336 --> 01:41:48,115
Rhodes, check his team out.

1214
01:41:48,614 --> 01:41:49,619
I'm on it.

1215
01:41:55,469 --> 01:41:56,929
Roman, get in front of me.

1216
01:42:03,743 --> 01:42:05,079
Ok, y'all wanna play it rough?

1217
01:42:06,613 --> 01:42:07,515
Now it's my turn.

1218
01:42:21,828 --> 01:42:23,244
Yeah, baby!

1219
01:42:32,739 --> 01:42:35,006
Guys,
we got snow mobile on the right.

1220
01:42:36,810 --> 01:42:38,604
They're going to flank us.

1221
01:42:42,782 --> 01:42:44,647
All there?

1222
01:42:49,689 --> 01:42:51,589
Oh shit!

1223
01:43:05,171 --> 01:43:05,803
Tej!

1224
01:43:06,439 --> 01:43:07,805
Roman hold tight.
I'm on the way.

1225
01:43:12,446 --> 01:43:15,876
I don't wanted no swimming. No!

1226
01:43:20,687 --> 01:43:22,621
Really Tez?

1227
01:43:24,658 --> 01:43:27,525
No. No. No.

1228
01:43:31,230 --> 01:43:32,204
Oh shit.

1229
01:43:34,818 --> 01:43:35,943
Roman, grab your door.

1230
01:43:36,161 --> 01:43:36,801
Tez!

1231
01:43:37,255 --> 01:43:38,503
Grab the door Roman.

1232
01:43:38,785 --> 01:43:41,408
It's all gone.
Oh Shit.

1233
01:43:53,462 --> 01:43:54,349
Roman, hang on.

1234
01:43:55,927 --> 01:43:56,646
Tej!

1235
01:43:58,967 --> 01:44:02,267
No, man. Get me off this thing.

1236
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:08,881
No!

1237
01:44:23,549 --> 01:44:25,953
Alright,
I've had enough of this shit!

1238
01:44:40,085 --> 01:44:41,870
Number 11 my Ass.

1239
01:44:44,303 --> 01:44:46,797
Don't shrink it.
We got a sub to catch, get in.

1240
01:45:00,859 --> 01:45:01,105
What?

1241
01:45:01,175 --> 01:45:03,291
Pressure is on alert
in the cargo hold.

1242
01:45:03,380 --> 01:45:04,561
Drop it to 10 thousand feet.

1243
01:45:05,727 --> 01:45:07,755
I know what these people
meant to you.

1244
01:45:08,162 --> 01:45:10,174
So I'll let you pick
the first target.

1245
01:45:10,474 --> 01:45:12,274
I'm not picking target
from a mile away.

1246
01:45:13,991 --> 01:45:16,857
I'd stand face to face,
and look 'em dead in the eye.

1247
01:45:18,471 --> 01:45:19,552
Ok.

1248
01:45:20,073 --> 01:45:21,840
That would wipe in the ass.

1249
01:45:41,470 --> 01:45:42,760
I'm enjoin the remains.

1250
01:45:43,096 --> 01:45:44,251
You don't go get any ideas.

1251
01:45:44,321 --> 01:45:45,990
You aren't placed out
of a good history.

1252
01:45:49,602 --> 01:45:51,568
No shit.

1253
01:45:51,638 --> 01:45:55,699
Let's go start fight.
She's gonna kill himself.

1254
01:45:58,645 --> 01:46:00,636
Pull up surveillance, right now.

1255
01:46:05,619 --> 01:46:06,745
Surprise.

1256
01:46:08,655 --> 01:46:10,623
Pierce must be dead.

1257
01:46:21,175 --> 01:46:23,722
You're driving.
I said it from the beginning.

1258
01:46:23,792 --> 01:46:25,509
No way, I'm not driving.

1259
01:46:26,773 --> 01:46:30,675
We have a security breach in the
cargo foil. Take care of it now.

1260
01:46:35,749 --> 01:46:38,898
Jesus Mum, you should
pose to avoid the nerves.

1261
01:46:38,968 --> 01:46:40,376
Oh, shut up, don't be such a baby.

1262
01:46:46,961 --> 01:46:48,697
Get to the pilot,
he's got the second key.

1263
01:46:48,767 --> 01:46:49,742
Wait for my signal.

1264
01:46:49,944 --> 01:46:51,321
Give Cipher my regards.

1265
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:08,648
He gave this, this day,
thinking out.

1266
01:47:08,848 --> 01:47:10,582
No, don't touch.

1267
01:47:10,717 --> 01:47:12,106
You can track Cipher with this,

1268
01:47:12,205 --> 01:47:15,430
but you can't do this on your own.
There's gotta be two of you.

1269
01:47:15,532 --> 01:47:17,538
Fine, I got contacts.

1270
01:47:18,692 --> 01:47:20,092
Now you're gonna take your brother.

1271
01:47:20,293 --> 01:47:21,428
- No.
- Yes.

1272
01:47:25,532 --> 01:47:26,692
Do I don't know where he is...?

1273
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:31,637
His copy's fake,
I can see everything inside his..

1274
01:47:31,638 --> 01:47:34,732
- It's called the God's eyes.
- Yeah, well. Whatever.

1275
01:47:36,176 --> 01:47:38,703
There's no way
I'm using Owen, alright?

1276
01:47:38,812 --> 01:47:40,570
He's a lost cause.

1277
01:47:40,948 --> 01:47:42,674
He's your brother, Deck.

1278
01:47:42,716 --> 01:47:46,584
He's my son.
He's our family.

1279
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:48,588
And our family that died...

1280
01:47:49,347 --> 01:47:51,350
Bloody shit happening.

1281
01:47:51,420 --> 01:47:53,601
You lied about, I mean,
I can't believe you.

1282
01:47:53,637 --> 01:47:56,501
You've got me upset,
you really upset your mother.

1283
01:47:56,763 --> 01:47:58,628
Call yourself a brother?

1284
01:47:58,631 --> 01:48:00,599
Oh come on, mum. Ok.

1285
01:48:02,769 --> 01:48:03,635
Every time!

1286
01:48:08,775 --> 01:48:10,300
- Owen.
- In position.

1287
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:13,804
Go.

1288
01:48:15,148 --> 01:48:16,240
I'm in.

1289
01:48:34,801 --> 01:48:36,701
I've got the package to lay on.

1290
01:48:36,970 --> 01:48:38,870
It's all personal.

1291
01:48:59,592 --> 01:49:00,701
You made me miss my son?

1292
01:49:01,628 --> 01:49:02,954
What do you think you're doing?

1293
01:49:05,898 --> 01:49:07,889
Looking at you dead in the eye.

1294
01:49:30,423 --> 01:49:31,473
That was for Letty.

1295
01:49:36,229 --> 01:49:38,841
- Rhodes.
- He is no longer with us.

1296
01:49:39,666 --> 01:49:41,857
Rhodes picked the wrong target.

1297
01:49:42,969 --> 01:49:43,972
Congratulations Dom.

1298
01:49:45,448 --> 01:49:46,448
You just killed your son.

1299
01:49:46,939 --> 01:49:47,928
You are wrong.

1300
01:49:47,974 --> 01:49:49,224
I just saved him.

1301
01:49:50,477 --> 01:49:52,936
Need to took your foot
off the tiger's neck.

1302
01:50:00,920 --> 01:50:03,912
You're welcome.
It's gonna get noisy.

1303
01:50:04,957 --> 01:50:06,822
This is for your relief.

1304
01:50:11,931 --> 01:50:12,760
Good?

1305
01:50:15,701 --> 01:50:16,861
Let's go.

1306
01:50:19,238 --> 01:50:22,840
Go stop him, do not let him
get off this plane.

1307
01:50:26,441 --> 01:50:28,481
That truck's had enough munition
to take us all out.

1308
01:50:28,948 --> 01:50:29,922
We don't give 'em a target.

1309
01:50:29,992 --> 01:50:31,432
Everybody get in
front of us, line up

1310
01:50:31,549 --> 01:50:32,918
- we will take the hit.
- What?

1311
01:50:33,352 --> 01:50:34,980
I need to switch cars, right now.

1312
01:50:51,503 --> 01:50:53,557
- Roman, here comes the bad part.
- What?

1313
01:51:00,246 --> 01:51:02,274
Hang in there guys!
We're almost through the lock.

1314
01:51:02,782 --> 01:51:05,339
It's easy for you to say,
when your ass ain't on fire.

1315
01:51:11,032 --> 01:51:12,329
Hold on little mate.

1316
01:51:12,758 --> 01:51:13,918
It's gonna be a little scary,

1317
01:51:14,921 --> 01:51:16,387
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

1318
01:51:27,807 --> 01:51:29,672
Is the music good?

1319
01:51:42,822 --> 01:51:43,846
They're locking on.

1320
01:51:43,890 --> 01:51:45,251
Sorry guys,
I got no trick for us..

1321
01:51:45,491 --> 01:51:47,488
- What do we do now?
- We start praying.

1322
01:52:10,817 --> 01:52:11,755
Hell yeah!

1323
01:52:24,264 --> 01:52:25,057
That's Dom!

1324
01:52:29,369 --> 01:52:31,753
- This guy in our side now?
- Who the hell cares?

1325
01:52:31,823 --> 01:52:33,123
He just saved our asses.

1326
01:52:36,576 --> 01:52:38,837
Good to be riding
with you again man.

1327
01:52:51,791 --> 01:52:53,191
Torretto's through the way
for them.

1328
01:52:53,451 --> 01:52:54,800
Someone give me something.

1329
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,886
- Torpedoes are ready.
- Then launch them.

1330
01:53:15,448 --> 01:53:17,009
- Take the wheel.
- I ain't taking shit.

1331
01:53:17,031 --> 01:53:20,240
- Take the wheel!
- Where are you doing?

1332
01:53:21,688 --> 01:53:22,646
This is crazy!

1333
01:53:27,127 --> 01:53:29,152
- Left or die!
- What?

1334
01:53:29,162 --> 01:53:32,131
Turn the goddamn wheel to the left,
really requesting.

1335
01:53:38,138 --> 01:53:39,264
Boom, baby!

1336
01:53:46,379 --> 01:53:47,271
That's alright!

1337
01:53:53,285 --> 01:53:54,216
Thank you the same.

1338
01:54:09,169 --> 01:54:10,136
Where is that smile?

1339
01:54:10,170 --> 01:54:12,229
There is!

1340
01:54:17,811 --> 01:54:21,374
You're gonna shoot a baby
You shoud...

1341
01:54:23,149 --> 01:54:24,470
You aren't gonna wanna see this?

1342
01:54:37,763 --> 01:54:38,710
Is that you or him?

1343
01:54:42,001 --> 01:54:43,098
Him.
Good.

1344
01:54:43,836 --> 01:54:44,832
The torpedo's missed,

1345
01:54:44,902 --> 01:54:46,988
they are gonna reach lot
before the sub does.

1346
01:54:47,088 --> 01:54:48,833
To hell they are.

1347
01:54:51,177 --> 01:54:52,871
Get ready for this.

1348
01:55:12,832 --> 01:55:13,730
Oh shit!

1349
01:55:13,733 --> 01:55:15,724
We're going to
need a bigger truck.

1350
01:55:40,594 --> 01:55:43,488
- Get us out of here.
- Why are you always yelling?

1351
01:55:47,266 --> 01:55:49,801
- This shit's crazy!
- Look out!

1352
01:55:55,875 --> 01:55:57,740
That's not good.

1353
01:55:58,711 --> 01:56:00,679
That's not good.

1354
01:56:05,885 --> 01:56:07,648
We got this.

1355
01:56:19,832 --> 01:56:21,766
That's my girl.

1356
01:56:27,773 --> 01:56:28,616
Sub's too close.

1357
01:56:28,686 --> 01:56:30,742
We ain't making it
to the gate in time.

1358
01:56:30,743 --> 01:56:31,943
We just gonna let it get away?

1359
01:56:32,178 --> 01:56:33,473
Not if I know Dom.

1360
01:56:38,684 --> 01:56:39,844
You loose. Dom.

1361
01:56:40,186 --> 01:56:41,880
I destroyed two of your teams

1362
01:56:42,722 --> 01:56:44,713
I killed your red headed boyfriend.

1363
01:56:44,890 --> 01:56:48,117
And I put two killers on you
untraceable plane.

1364
01:56:49,562 --> 01:56:52,134
You lost the minute
you interrupted my honeymoon.

1365
01:56:55,101 --> 01:56:57,692
Put a heat-seeker on him now.

1366
01:56:59,672 --> 01:57:00,832
Now!

1367
01:57:11,150 --> 01:57:13,641
There is a goddamn heat seeker
coming at us.

1368
01:57:24,663 --> 01:57:27,625
Oh my...
come and get it.

1369
01:57:48,687 --> 01:57:50,664
Guys!
Dive..

1370
01:57:50,890 --> 01:57:54,621
This... This is for my son!

1371
01:58:13,381 --> 01:58:14,423
Dom!

1372
01:59:16,842 --> 01:59:18,220
You aren't pulling this Deckard.

1373
01:59:18,377 --> 01:59:21,646
Like I'm need a gun
to take care of you,

1374
01:59:22,748 --> 01:59:23,772
How did you find me?

1375
01:59:25,784 --> 01:59:29,375
You want to see the old Dom?
Watch!

1376
01:59:32,858 --> 01:59:34,509
Resourceful.

1377
01:59:34,894 --> 01:59:36,597
It belonged to us before Cipher.

1378
01:59:37,803 --> 01:59:39,203
You pulled my family through.

1379
01:59:40,223 --> 01:59:41,077
A mother.

1380
01:59:43,102 --> 01:59:45,093
I'll make sure
that never happens again.

1381
01:59:45,338 --> 01:59:47,101
To anyone.

1382
01:59:47,406 --> 01:59:49,846
There is only one
flaw in your plan.

1383
01:59:49,916 --> 01:59:51,199
What's that?

1384
01:59:51,210 --> 01:59:53,201
Only one of us has a parachute!

1385
02:00:16,368 --> 02:00:17,902
Told you this would be fun!

1386
02:00:21,807 --> 02:00:23,672
Boys!

1387
02:00:33,385 --> 02:00:35,055
You know I've never left you,
right?

1388
02:00:35,125 --> 02:00:35,698
I know.

1389
02:00:36,955 --> 02:00:38,855
You know I never will..

1390
02:00:40,859 --> 02:00:41,951
I know.

1391
02:00:51,437 --> 02:00:53,862
I've so much to tell you.

1392
02:00:54,507 --> 02:00:57,584
Yeah you do,
and you can start with that.

1393
02:01:02,681 --> 02:01:06,817
Now, that's...
Dominic Toretto.

1394
02:01:07,986 --> 02:01:11,752
Hey Dom!
You're just towing it out there?

1395
02:01:11,790 --> 02:01:13,095
We need to get up out of here.

1396
02:01:13,421 --> 02:01:16,668
Cause this all kinda neuclearism
happening under this ice.

1397
02:01:16,929 --> 02:01:19,951
Relax! Without the trigger chips,
those nukes are harmless.

1398
02:01:20,666 --> 02:01:21,924
Ok. So we good then.

1399
02:01:22,401 --> 02:01:24,928
Lemme go and get my
young selfie levels up.

1400
02:01:25,938 --> 02:01:27,929
You realize this is
a classified, right?

1401
02:01:27,973 --> 02:01:29,770
Not today.

1402
02:01:32,778 --> 02:01:34,815
We have to get up out of here man.
I'm freezing.

1403
02:02:02,975 --> 02:02:04,104
It's Okay.

1404
02:02:04,877 --> 02:02:06,317
Don't worry,
he's gonna be here soon.

1405
02:02:07,180 --> 02:02:09,114
I get it, y'all got a lot in common.

1406
02:02:09,115 --> 02:02:11,598
Computer hacks,
god's eyes, gigs, nerd.

1407
02:02:11,775 --> 02:02:14,362
..you know, but we got a
lot in common too! Alright?

1408
02:02:14,462 --> 02:02:16,192
- Like what?
- We walk in the room,

1409
02:02:16,588 --> 02:02:18,515
and we are oozing sex appeal.

1410
02:02:18,715 --> 02:02:20,809
Me and you?
There's a problem.

1411
02:02:21,009 --> 02:02:23,087
I am asking the real
question right now.

1412
02:02:23,695 --> 02:02:25,023
Is it gonna be...

1413
02:02:26,065 --> 02:02:30,049
the Nerd or...
the dark knight?

1414
02:02:31,237 --> 02:02:33,102
This time I like both of you.

1415
02:02:33,239 --> 02:02:36,231
A'rigt!
Yeah..yea!

1416
02:02:36,275 --> 02:02:38,998
But just before we
get into all of that,

1417
02:02:39,417 --> 02:02:41,516
Let me ask you one question.

1418
02:02:41,716 --> 02:02:44,240
- You can ask me anything.
- Anything.

1419
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:46,017
What's my last name?

1420
02:02:48,287 --> 02:02:52,168
When you guys pick around with then
I guess you can let me know.

1421
02:02:52,368 --> 02:02:55,346
It's gonna be a Parker.
That's all that really matters.

1422
02:02:55,369 --> 02:02:56,452
Jones, Miss Parker.

1423
02:02:56,906 --> 02:02:58,567
Hey Miss Parker.

1424
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:00,985
- Hey.
- Hey.

1425
02:03:01,867 --> 02:03:03,201
I wanted to thank you.

1426
02:03:03,969 --> 02:03:04,665
No need.

1427
02:03:07,723 --> 02:03:08,609
Cipher's still on the loose.

1428
02:03:08,679 --> 02:03:10,008
There's been some
reports she's in Athens.

1429
02:03:10,222 --> 02:03:12,276
But she won't be
nuking any city anytime.

1430
02:03:12,828 --> 02:03:13,886
So, thanks to you guys.

1431
02:03:13,929 --> 02:03:18,662
- So, I got you a parting favor.
- This can't be...

1432
02:03:19,668 --> 02:03:21,829
Full re-instatement.
You got you job back.

1433
02:03:21,870 --> 02:03:23,343
That is if you want.

1434
02:03:26,842 --> 02:03:27,965
If I want?

1435
02:03:35,818 --> 02:03:37,809
You know after 16 years.

1436
02:03:38,787 --> 02:03:40,449
I figured it's time
for a little break.

1437
02:03:40,519 --> 02:03:41,019
Wow.

1438
02:03:42,891 --> 02:03:44,859
Daddy's stayin' home.

1439
02:03:51,767 --> 02:03:53,860
- Nobody.
- Get in touch!

1440
02:03:54,103 --> 02:03:55,863
Ah, hang on a second.

1441
02:03:56,205 --> 02:03:57,865
This could be interesting.

1442
02:04:02,979 --> 02:04:04,898
What made you think I would do it?

1443
02:04:05,781 --> 02:04:09,016
Brother-hood.
I saw that look in your sight man.

1444
02:04:09,116 --> 02:04:10,817
I knew you wanted revenge.

1445
02:04:10,886 --> 02:04:12,074
Glad I did it.

1446
02:04:15,791 --> 02:04:17,705
Can't believe you
went to see my mama.

1447
02:04:27,803 --> 02:04:28,862
Come on.

1448
02:04:33,809 --> 02:04:35,333
All this fuss of you.

1449
02:04:41,650 --> 02:04:42,810
Yes.

1450
02:04:48,156 --> 02:04:50,861
Alena,
I promise to keep our son safe.

1451
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:55,009
And now.. he always will be.

1452
02:05:03,805 --> 02:05:05,797
I want to introduce
you to the most

1453
02:05:05,867 --> 02:05:07,689
important person
in my universe.

1454
02:05:09,311 --> 02:05:11,778
Who will never give up on me.

1455
02:05:20,556 --> 02:05:21,716
You've heard me say.

1456
02:05:22,478 --> 02:05:24,786
"That you never turn
your back on family."

1457
02:05:26,728 --> 02:05:30,858
And I wanna thank you all
for never turning your back on me.

1458
02:05:35,404 --> 02:05:36,898
You wanna meet them?

1459
02:05:37,906 --> 02:05:39,771
Alright!

1460
02:05:40,142 --> 02:05:41,083
Everyone...

1461
02:05:42,760 --> 02:05:44,074
Meet Bryan.

1462
02:05:53,189 --> 02:05:54,292
Hey Bryan.

1463
02:05:54,362 --> 02:05:58,886
Yeah,
I guess he's my turning secret.

1464
02:05:59,901 --> 02:06:01,717
Thank you for giving us family.

1465
02:06:03,332 --> 02:06:12,604
