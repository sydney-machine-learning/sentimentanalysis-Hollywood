1
00:02:54,568 --> 00:02:57,568
Attention, pirates alongside!

2
00:02:58,592 --> 00:03:02,592
Pirates alongside!
Take cover. All crew below deck!

3
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:05,516
I repeat Pirates alongside!

4
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,540
Initiate emergency procedure!

5
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,564
All crew below deck!

6
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:55,588
Emergency positions!
Code red! Code red!

7
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:58,512
Get everybody below deck, now!

8
00:04:00,536 --> 00:04:02,536
Everyone, get down!

9
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
Jack, where's that UN convoy?

10
00:04:06,584 --> 00:04:09,584
The chopper's on its way, sir.
ETA 30 minutes!

11
00:04:09,608 --> 00:04:11,608
Get everybody below deck.

12
00:06:31,532 --> 00:06:37,332
<font face="Viner Hand ITC" color="#8080c0">WOLF WARRIOR II</font></font></font>

13
00:06:58,556 --> 00:07:01,556
I'm waiting for my son

14
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,580
I need our home for his return!

15
00:07:06,504 --> 00:07:07,577
Wait till police get here!

16
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:09,504
Let's see how you're
going to tear our houses!

17
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:12,528
If they wanna die, then let 'em.

18
00:07:26,552 --> 00:07:28,552
Mrs. Yu,
Mrs.Fei.

19
00:07:29,576 --> 00:07:31,576
We brought Xiao Fei home.

20
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
Salute!

21
00:07:50,524 --> 00:07:53,524
Tell these rookies what our motto is.

22
00:07:53,548 --> 00:07:55,548
Be humble

23
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:57,595
I became a soldier because
I wanted to be in battles

24
00:07:57,596 --> 00:07:59,596
and now, what about the battles?

25
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,660
Much better to be at home with
wife and kids instead.

26
00:08:06,544 --> 00:08:08,544
My daughter,
she's beautiful, huh?

27
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:34,568
You gang of sumbags!

28
00:08:34,592 --> 00:08:36,592
You think you're tough, huh?

29
00:08:43,516 --> 00:08:45,516
Go get them!
Get them!

30
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,540
Officer see! He's got a gun!

31
00:09:06,564 --> 00:09:08,564
A gun!

32
00:09:09,588 --> 00:09:11,588
Comrade, put down your weapon!

33
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:24,512
You're pretty lethal, huh?

34
00:09:24,536 --> 00:09:26,536
Well you'd better kill me now,

35
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
because you're gone,

36
00:09:29,584 --> 00:09:31,584
I'm gonna make them wish they
were dead.

37
00:09:53,508 --> 00:09:55,508
Hey!

38
00:10:00,532 --> 00:10:02,532
Leng Feng!

39
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:33,556
The reason a soldier is respected

40
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,580
is not because of the uniform he wears,

41
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:40,504
but is because of the sense of
duty he carries.

42
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:44,528
With or without the uniform,
the duty remains.

43
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:46,552
And he continues to be respected.

44
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:04,576
Three years later.

45
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,500
<font color=#ffff00>SHENMUTUSAWA BAY, AFRICA.</font>

46
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:16,524
Hey, hurry up!

47
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:21,548
Hey, Leng.
There's our hero.

48
00:11:21,572 --> 00:11:23,572
Thanks for saving the lives of
everyone.

49
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:25,596
- Let's take a picture together.
- No problem!

50
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,920
- Thank you!
- Ok, see you!

51
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:30,921
Take care, see you!

52
00:11:35,545 --> 00:11:37,545
Hey, boss!

53
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:40,569
Buy some, it's good stuff.
- There was an outbreak in Taman recently.

54
00:11:40,593 --> 00:11:43,593
Because of consuming this herbs,
there were 4 survivors.

55
00:11:43,617 --> 00:11:45,617
- Please!
- No, thank you!

56
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:47,641
Please help please consider.

57
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,665
Boss.

58
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:53,589
Chinese wine.

59
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:56,513
This.

60
00:11:56,537 --> 00:11:58,537
- Hey, hey.
- Come on man.

61
00:11:58,561 --> 00:12:00,561
Ok, this one is okay.

62
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:04,585
Nice one.
See you next time.

63
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:10,509
Get up here!

64
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,533
Welcome back!

65
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:23,557
Bye.

66
00:12:24,581 --> 00:12:26,581
This, good for you.

67
00:12:27,505 --> 00:12:29,505
You're not alone

68
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:33,529
20 dollars.
Buy one get one free.

69
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:37,553
- Who am I?
- My godfather.

70
00:12:37,577 --> 00:12:40,577
If your godfather tells
your mother about this,

71
00:12:40,601 --> 00:12:43,501
what would she think?
Confiscated!

72
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:54,549
Begin!

73
00:12:55,573 --> 00:13:00,573
Godfather! Godfather! Godfather!

74
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:09,597
Harry! Harry! Harry!

75
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,621
Godfather! Godfather! Godfather!

76
00:13:24,545 --> 00:13:29,545
Leng! Leng! Leng!

77
00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:39,569
Who?

78
00:13:42,593 --> 00:13:44,593
Who?

79
00:13:45,517 --> 00:13:48,517
Who else? Who else?

80
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,541
Do it, do it.

81
00:13:51,565 --> 00:13:53,565
Fuck it!

82
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:55,589
Who the fuck you think you are?

83
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:57,613
Come on!

84
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,637
Yeah

85
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,561
Patrick! Patrick! Patrick!

86
00:14:54,585 --> 00:14:56,585
I've been sent to the border
for a mission.

87
00:14:57,509 --> 00:14:59,509
When I get back,

88
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:02,533
this had better be signed.

89
00:15:14,057 --> 00:15:16,057
Marriage Application.

90
00:15:17,081 --> 00:15:19,081
Why did you join the army?

91
00:15:19,105 --> 00:15:22,425
Join the army, you regret it for two years.
Don't join the army, regret it for life.

92
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:25,029
- The truth?
- That's the truth.

93
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:28,053
Drink!
Again!

94
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,001
Comrade Long Xiao Yun.

95
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:38,145
Was attacked while carrying her
mission at the border.

96
00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:42,049
We found this bullet.

97
00:15:45,073 --> 00:15:47,073
Drink again.

98
00:15:54,097 --> 00:15:56,097
What do you want to hear?

99
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,021
What do you want to hear?

100
00:15:58,045 --> 00:16:00,045
Drink!

101
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:14,069
Again!

102
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:33,993
You win.

103
00:16:34,017 --> 00:16:36,017
You win.

104
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,041
But I lost...

105
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,065
I've lost completely.

106
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:44,089
It's been more than a year
since you came on board.

107
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:48,013
During that time, from
Djerba to Tolanaro,

108
00:16:48,037 --> 00:16:52,037
I've asked all the chiefs.
More than half of Africa,

109
00:16:52,061 --> 00:16:56,061
And nobody has seen that bullet before.
Peluru itu sebelumnya.

110
00:16:56,085 --> 00:16:59,085
<i>I will find it,</i>

111
00:16:59,109 --> 00:17:01,109
<i>even if I have to scour
the entire continent.</i>

112
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:22,033
Dear fellow countrymen,

113
00:17:22,057 --> 00:17:27,057
my deepest condolences to the families their
loved ones during Batchka Village incident.

114
00:17:28,081 --> 00:17:31,104
Early today, the red scarf rebel army
claimed responsibility for the Batchka Village.

115
00:17:31,105 --> 00:17:33,105
Our government condemns
their barbaric behavior.

116
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:36,029
Our homeland has been attacked on
multiple occasions.

117
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:39,053
These are great tragedies.

118
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:47,077
The rebels continue to advance as the
country grapples with the Lamanla outbreak.

119
00:17:47,101 --> 00:17:48,849
As your government,
we will not back down.

120
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:51,001
The great people's army
will fight to the very end.

121
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:55,025
Quarantine have been set up
across the country,

122
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:57,049
in an attempt to contain
the Lamanla outbreak.

123
00:17:57,073 --> 00:18:04,073
We have declared a state of emergency.

124
00:18:12,097 --> 00:18:14,097
Hey, brother.

125
00:18:14,121 --> 00:18:16,121
You shorted me 300 bucks.

126
00:18:17,045 --> 00:18:19,045
Be careful with that.

127
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:23,069
Look, we're both Chinese.

128
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:25,093
You do this to your own people?

129
00:18:25,117 --> 00:18:28,017
Since 3 pm on the 14th of last month,

130
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,041
I am no longer officailly Chinese.

131
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:34,065
What? Fresh off the boat?

132
00:18:38,089 --> 00:18:41,089
Hear that?
In times like this,

133
00:18:41,113 --> 00:18:43,113
that's the price you get.

134
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:50,037
Seen this before?

135
00:18:53,061 --> 00:18:55,061
Nope

136
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:59,085
I've been told that it came
from these parts.

137
00:19:01,009 --> 00:19:03,009
Definitely never seen it.

138
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:05,033
Hey boss.

139
00:19:06,057 --> 00:19:08,057
How are you? Smoking?

140
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:42,081
Tundu!

141
00:20:53,005 --> 00:20:55,005
Go! Go!

142
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:03,029
Don't shoot!

143
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,053
Don't shoot!

144
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:06,177
- Don't shoot!
- Good people.

145
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:08,201
Go, go, go!

146
00:21:15,225 --> 00:21:17,225
Get the fuck down or you die!

147
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:18,357
Hail the revolution!

148
00:21:18,387 --> 00:21:20,049
You're now talking to rebels!

149
00:21:20,073 --> 00:21:22,073
Don't lie to me.
Your luck is down!

150
00:21:22,097 --> 00:21:24,097
Hail the revolution!

151
00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:28,421
No, no, no Guys, look!

152
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:30,445
Revolution!

153
00:21:32,069 --> 00:21:34,069
- What the fuck is this?!
- No, no, no.

154
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:36,093
He's a pro-government rat!

155
00:21:36,117 --> 00:21:38,017
- NO!
- You lied to me!

156
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,041
No!
Hail the rebels! Hail the rebels!

157
00:22:27,065 --> 00:22:29,065
Shit!

158
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:38,089
Tundu!

159
00:22:49,013 --> 00:22:49,629
Chinese embassy.

160
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,013
Let's go to the Chinese embassy.

161
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,037
They'll take us in.
We're Chinese.

162
00:22:55,061 --> 00:22:57,061
What about us?
What're we suppose to do?

163
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:59,085
- Will they accept us?
- Hard to say.

164
00:22:59,109 --> 00:23:02,009
- That's our country.
- Everybody follow me.

165
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:09,033
Go!

166
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:12,057
Go!

167
00:23:24,081 --> 00:23:26,081
Go!

168
00:23:33,005 --> 00:23:35,005
Go!

169
00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:41,529
Come on!

170
00:23:55,053 --> 00:23:57,053
No!

171
00:23:58,577 --> 00:24:00,577
Here.

172
00:26:31,001 --> 00:26:34,001
Slow down!
No, no! We're Chinese.

173
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,025
- Go, go!
- Tundu!

174
00:26:36,049 --> 00:26:38,049
Go, go, go!

175
00:26:39,073 --> 00:26:41,073
Die! Scum! Hail the revolution!

176
00:26:41,097 --> 00:26:43,097
Die! Scum!

177
00:26:45,021 --> 00:26:47,021
Die! Scum!

178
00:26:51,045 --> 00:26:53,045
- Die!
- Lower your guns!

179
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,069
Put down your weapons!

180
00:26:57,093 --> 00:26:59,093
Lower your guns!
Lower your guns!

181
00:27:03,017 --> 00:27:05,017
Stand down!

182
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:07,041
We are Chinese!

183
00:27:07,065 --> 00:27:09,065
We are Chinese!

184
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:12,089
China and Africa are friends!

185
00:27:21,013 --> 00:27:23,013
Go.

186
00:27:24,037 --> 00:27:26,037
Go, hurry.
Go.

187
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,061
Go.

188
00:27:30,085 --> 00:27:32,085
Fall back!

189
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:39,009
Help! Help!

190
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:53,533
South Indian Ociean. Redeployment of China Navy Fleet
to Africa for evacuating operations by Central Military Commission.

191
00:29:03,557 --> 00:29:07,557
Commander, all foreign vessels
are leaving the war zone.

192
00:29:07,581 --> 00:29:10,581
The harbor is unsafe.
Are you certain about docking?

193
00:29:13,505 --> 00:29:15,505
Forward 10 knots.

194
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:17,529
Set course bearing for 270.

195
00:29:30,553 --> 00:29:32,553
Open the gate!

196
00:29:50,577 --> 00:29:53,577
Well done, you got here just in time.

197
00:29:53,601 --> 00:29:56,501
- What's the situation?
- The entire country's in chaos.

198
00:29:56,525 --> 00:29:59,525
The war has destroyed lives of
many of countrymen.

199
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:02,549
Can you send our troops
in to help?

200
00:30:02,573 --> 00:30:04,573
Without the UN's authorization,

201
00:30:04,597 --> 00:30:06,597
our troops aren't premitted
to enter the war zone.

202
00:30:10,521 --> 00:30:15,521
OK, slow down
Up we go! Nice!

203
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:18,545
Where are from?
He can't board.

204
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:20,569
He's my son.

205
00:30:20,593 --> 00:30:22,593
We have tickets. See, look!

206
00:30:22,617 --> 00:30:24,617
Three tickets.
79, 80, 81.

207
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:28,541
Fine then.
79, 80, 81.

208
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:30,565
Thank you.

209
00:30:31,589 --> 00:30:33,589
Where are we going?

210
00:30:33,613 --> 00:30:36,513
Mr. Prime Minister,
please listen to me.

211
00:30:36,537 --> 00:30:39,537
I'm deeply sorry for what's happening
in your country.

212
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,510
But I believe you have not forgotten
about the help,

213
00:30:43,534 --> 00:30:45,534
we provided to your country

214
00:30:45,558 --> 00:30:48,558
<i>and friendship between our countries</i>

215
00:30:48,582 --> 00:30:50,582
<i>I believe you understand how important</i>

216
00:30:50,606 --> 00:30:53,506
<i>our citizen Dr. Chen
is to Africa.</i>

217
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,030
Please send somebody to protect
his safety.

218
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:58,054
I'm sorry,

219
00:30:58,078 --> 00:31:00,978
- you're on your own this time.
- <i>Prime Minister.</i>

220
00:31:01,002 --> 00:31:03,002
Where's Dr. Chen?

221
00:31:05,026 --> 00:31:07,026
I will never

222
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,050
tell you.

223
00:31:09,074 --> 00:31:11,074
Dyon Military Resourcing corporation
, Roach.

224
00:31:15,074 --> 00:31:17,074
Let's go!

225
00:31:19,098 --> 00:31:21,098
12 years of hard work.

226
00:31:22,022 --> 00:31:25,022
One war,
and it's all fucking gone.

227
00:31:27,046 --> 00:31:29,046
The bullet...

228
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:31,070
what's the story?

229
00:31:43,094 --> 00:31:45,094
Tundu!

230
00:31:46,018 --> 00:31:48,018
Tundu!
If you get off, you can't get back on.

231
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:51,042
Tundu!
Tundu!

232
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:52,466
- Stop right there!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry

233
00:31:52,467 --> 00:31:54,067
I want my mom!

234
00:31:54,091 --> 00:31:56,091
I want my mom, I don't
want to go to China!

235
00:31:56,615 --> 00:31:58,515
- Look at me.
- I want my mom!

236
00:31:58,539 --> 00:32:00,539
I want my mom!

237
00:32:01,563 --> 00:32:03,563
- Ok? I want my mom!
- Hey brother.

238
00:32:06,587 --> 00:32:08,587
What are you doing down here?

239
00:32:08,611 --> 00:32:11,511
There's something I have to tell you.

240
00:32:11,535 --> 00:32:13,535
That bullet...

241
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,559
I've seen it before.
That pattern,

242
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:20,583
is a symbol used by the rebel forces.

243
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:23,507
An arm dealer friend of mine told me

244
00:32:23,531 --> 00:32:26,531
the rebels have hired the most expensive
mercenaries out of Europe.

245
00:32:27,555 --> 00:32:29,555
Whatever grudge you've
got against them,

246
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:31,579
I urge you,

247
00:32:31,603 --> 00:32:33,603
- don't go seeking death.
- 47 Chinese workers!

248
00:32:33,627 --> 00:32:35,627
Are still stuck at
the Hanbond Chinese factory.

249
00:32:35,651 --> 00:32:38,551
What's worse, Dr, Chen is stuck 55 km

250
00:32:38,575 --> 00:32:39,975
behind enemy lines
on a medical relief mission.

251
00:32:39,976 --> 00:32:42,576
He's a high value target
for the rebel army.

252
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,960
Everything is in total lockdown
from Lochino to St. Francis.

253
00:32:45,524 --> 00:32:47,524
Without UN's authorization,

254
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,548
my troops aren't allowed to
enter the war zone.

255
00:32:49,572 --> 00:32:51,572
This operation is highly important!

256
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:53,596
We have to evacuate
those Chinese workers!

257
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,520
And Dr. Chen by all means!

258
00:32:55,544 --> 00:32:58,567
Under current circumstances, combat troops
are prohibited from entering the warzone!

259
00:32:58,568 --> 00:33:00,568
In order to complete the evacuation,

260
00:33:00,592 --> 00:33:02,592
someone has to undertake
the mission alone!

261
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:04,616
- I'll go.
- Stop right there!

262
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
What's your purpose?

263
00:33:07,564 --> 00:33:10,564
Former PLA,
South-east region,

264
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,588
Specail Ops Brigade,
Wolf Warrior squadron,

265
00:33:13,512 --> 00:33:15,512
Leng Feng.

266
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:17,536
This child's mother is
at Hanbond Chinese factory.

267
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,560
I know approximately
where it is located.

268
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:27,584
I promise you,

269
00:33:27,608 --> 00:33:30,508
I will bring your mom back.

270
00:33:36,532 --> 00:33:38,532
We took care of business
now, didn't we?

271
00:33:38,556 --> 00:33:40,556
Ambassador Thomas, King Angola,
Prince Drew.

272
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,580
That goddamn communications manager.

273
00:33:44,504 --> 00:33:46,504
They're all gone.
They all disappeared,

274
00:33:46,528 --> 00:33:48,528
real mysterously!

275
00:33:48,552 --> 00:33:51,552
<i>Stop wasting my time with
that crap!</i>

276
00:33:51,576 --> 00:33:53,576
<i>Where's Dr. Chen?</i>

277
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,500
Ah, Jesus.

278
00:34:12,524 --> 00:34:14,524
You tell him what you told me.

279
00:34:14,548 --> 00:34:16,548
Dr. Chen

280
00:34:16,572 --> 00:34:20,572
is at St. Francis Chinese-invested
hospital.

281
00:34:20,596 --> 00:34:22,596
Good boy.

282
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,520
Did you hear that?

283
00:34:32,544 --> 00:34:34,544
That could be sound of the future.

284
00:34:42,568 --> 00:34:46,568
Sir, Why are we helping
these fucking idiots?

285
00:34:46,592 --> 00:34:48,592
Welcome to Africa, son.

286
00:34:49,516 --> 00:34:51,516
Alrights, let's move out boys!

287
00:35:10,564 --> 00:35:12,564
From the latest report,

288
00:35:12,588 --> 00:35:14,588
the fighting is reaching
Semshalemu harbour.

289
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:18,512
The urgency of the evacuating
1536 Chinese nationals wating there

290
00:35:18,536 --> 00:35:20,536
has just been escalated.

291
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,560
Our vessels are heading over
at top speed.

292
00:35:22,584 --> 00:35:25,584
My apologies, because the
conflict is on foreign soil,

293
00:35:25,608 --> 00:35:27,608
you'll have no reinforcements,

294
00:35:27,632 --> 00:35:29,632
no allies and no weapons.

295
00:35:29,656 --> 00:35:32,556
Dr. Chen and 47 Chinese workers,

296
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,580
evacuate them all.

297
00:35:34,604 --> 00:35:38,504
Sunkoojia.

298
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:58,528
<font color=#ffff00>Quanrantine Zone, Danger
Do Not Enter.</font>

299
00:36:06,552 --> 00:36:09,452
<font color=#ffff00>Sunkoojia, St Francis Chinese-Invested,
Hospital.</font>

300
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:11,576
My boss asked me

301
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,600
to find Dr. Chen.

302
00:36:13,624 --> 00:36:16,524
Nobody wants to do something!

303
00:36:16,548 --> 00:36:19,548
Now, I have to try my luck.

304
00:36:19,572 --> 00:36:21,572
Because

305
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,596
I have

306
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,620
a special vision.

307
00:36:26,544 --> 00:36:28,544
Let me guess...

308
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,368
Saint Francis China-Hospital.

309
00:36:53,592 --> 00:36:55,592
Are you Dr. Chen?

310
00:36:55,616 --> 00:36:58,516
- I'm not! I'm not!
- Are you Dr. Chen?

311
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,540
- Are you Dr. Chen?
- No, no, no.

312
00:37:01,564 --> 00:37:03,564
She's a child, just a child

313
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:05,588
- I am.
- No.

314
00:37:08,512 --> 00:37:10,512
No

315
00:37:13,536 --> 00:37:15,536
I'm Dr. Chen.

316
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
You are Dr. Chen?

317
00:37:24,584 --> 00:37:27,584
Looks like Dr. Chen doesn't have balls.

318
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:30,508
What do you want?

319
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:32,532
- I am Dr. Chen.
- Dr. Rachel, no!

320
00:37:34,556 --> 00:37:36,556
She's not Dr. Chen.

321
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,580
She's a very good doctor.

322
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:40,604
She saved so many lives.

323
00:37:41,528 --> 00:37:43,528
No!

324
00:37:51,552 --> 00:37:53,552
Dr. Chen!

325
00:37:53,576 --> 00:37:55,576
Papa!

326
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,500
You just killed.

327
00:37:59,524 --> 00:38:00,524
Dr. Chen.

328
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:04,572
- Papa!
- Dr. Chen!

329
00:39:42,596 --> 00:39:44,596
Dr. Chen, right?

330
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,620
I was sent by Ambassador
Fan to rescue you.

331
00:39:49,544 --> 00:39:51,544
This is my daughter, Pasha.

332
00:39:51,568 --> 00:39:53,568
Please, I beg you, protect her.

333
00:39:59,592 --> 00:40:01,592
Dr. Chen!

334
00:40:02,516 --> 00:40:04,516
Come with me!

335
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,540
Get in the car!

336
00:40:31,564 --> 00:40:33,564
Go fast!

337
00:40:39,588 --> 00:40:41,588
What are you doing?

338
00:40:41,612 --> 00:40:44,512
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm saving your ass!

339
00:40:56,536 --> 00:40:58,536
Let me drive!

340
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,560
Move!

341
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:55,584
What the hell!

342
00:41:56,508 --> 00:41:58,508
Turn around!

343
00:41:59,532 --> 00:42:01,532
Go, go, go!

344
00:42:32,556 --> 00:42:34,556
Jesus.

345
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,580
Pasha!

346
00:44:31,504 --> 00:44:33,504
Are you okay?

347
00:44:33,528 --> 00:44:35,528
Are you okay?

348
00:44:35,552 --> 00:44:37,552
Are you okay?

349
00:44:47,576 --> 00:44:49,576
Are you okay?

350
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:54,500
Are you okay?

351
00:44:54,524 --> 00:44:56,524
Yeah.

352
00:44:56,548 --> 00:45:01,548
Pasha.

353
00:45:06,572 --> 00:45:08,572
Stop!

354
00:45:09,596 --> 00:45:11,596
Stop!

355
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,520
You want food?
We have food.

356
00:45:25,544 --> 00:45:27,544
We have food, okay?

357
00:45:27,568 --> 00:45:29,568
We have food.

358
00:45:59,592 --> 00:46:01,592
Are you okay?

359
00:46:19,516 --> 00:46:21,516
Thank you.

360
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:28,540
Is that from quarantine zone?

361
00:46:29,564 --> 00:46:31,464
Pasha, can you please hand me the bag?

362
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:33,721
I said, did you get that in
the quarantine zone?

363
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:39,545
- It's nothing.
- I'm not overreacting.

364
00:46:40,569 --> 00:46:42,569
In fact, it's better if I was.

365
00:46:42,593 --> 00:46:45,593
Those people back there were
infected with the Lamanla virus.

366
00:46:45,617 --> 00:46:47,617
Symptoms include the
sudden onset fever,

367
00:46:47,641 --> 00:46:49,541
hallucinations, lesions,

368
00:46:49,565 --> 00:46:52,648
cold sweats.
It's a fatal virus that's transmitted

369
00:46:52,678 --> 00:46:54,565
through direct human contact.

370
00:46:54,589 --> 00:46:57,589
Upon contraction, death strikes between
four hours and five months.

371
00:46:57,613 --> 00:47:01,513
Up until now,
no cure has been found.

372
00:47:01,537 --> 00:47:03,837
Don't worry, I'm insured.

373
00:47:23,561 --> 00:47:25,561
You're killing the Chinese?

374
00:47:26,585 --> 00:47:28,585
This is a big trouble.

375
00:47:28,609 --> 00:47:30,609
Why are you killing the Chinese?

376
00:47:33,533 --> 00:47:36,533
- Sir...
- I thought you wanted Dr. Chen.

377
00:47:38,557 --> 00:47:41,557
Congratulations.
You found him.

378
00:47:44,605 --> 00:47:46,605
Fuck!

379
00:47:46,629 --> 00:47:48,629
I wanted him alive!

380
00:47:48,653 --> 00:47:49,653
Alive!

381
00:47:49,677 --> 00:47:53,577
Don't you understand how important
it is to me?

382
00:47:57,501 --> 00:47:59,501
Fuck!

383
00:48:01,525 --> 00:48:03,525
Wait.

384
00:48:03,549 --> 00:48:05,549
That girl.

385
00:48:06,573 --> 00:48:08,573
I like her.

386
00:48:08,597 --> 00:48:11,082
Sir, our facial recognition
crew uploaded video

387
00:48:11,112 --> 00:48:13,597
of this man fighting
off some of the pirates.

388
00:48:13,621 --> 00:48:15,521
His name's Leng.

389
00:48:15,545 --> 00:48:18,545
Ex-member of a secretive special ops
unit pot of China.

390
00:48:18,569 --> 00:48:20,569
Wolf Warrior.

391
00:48:20,593 --> 00:48:22,593
Boys!

392
00:48:32,517 --> 00:48:34,540
The Doctors Without Borders
were killed by armed mercenaries.

393
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:37,541
The lives of Dr. Cheng and
other Chinese medical staff were scarificed.

394
00:48:37,565 --> 00:48:39,565
<i>Comrade Leng,</i>

395
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:41,589
do you stand by what
are you're saying?

396
00:48:41,613 --> 00:48:44,513
Are you certain you witnessed the massacre
or our medical team?

397
00:48:44,537 --> 00:48:46,537
I'm cetain.

398
00:48:46,561 --> 00:48:49,561
Dr. Chen give me his daughter
before he died.

399
00:48:49,585 --> 00:48:51,585
An African girl.

400
00:48:51,609 --> 00:48:53,609
Her name is Pasha.
Oh, and anurse too.

401
00:48:53,633 --> 00:48:55,533
What's your name?

402
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,557
Rachel Prescott Smith.
You can call me Rachel.

403
00:48:58,581 --> 00:49:00,581
Doctor Rachel, I'm not a nurse.

404
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:03,505
Report the situation to Ambassador
Fan immediately.

405
00:49:03,529 --> 00:49:05,529
Yes sir.

406
00:49:05,553 --> 00:49:07,553
Commander, may I speak to
my son please?

407
00:49:08,577 --> 00:49:11,577
<i>Godfather, godfather! Where's my mom?
Where's my mom?</i>

408
00:49:11,601 --> 00:49:13,601
<i>Hey, Tundu, Tundu!
Trust me, Trust your godfather.</i>

409
00:49:14,525 --> 00:49:16,525
We are going to Hanbond Chinese factoty

410
00:49:16,549 --> 00:49:18,549
to find your mom right now, okay?

411
00:49:19,573 --> 00:49:21,573
Thank you, godfather.

412
00:49:21,597 --> 00:49:23,597
Leng, I have some bad news for you.

413
00:49:23,621 --> 00:49:26,521
<i>The rebel army is sobotaging
all major roads,</i>

414
00:49:26,545 --> 00:49:28,545
<i>railways and bridges.</i>

415
00:49:28,569 --> 00:49:30,569
<i>As of 10 minutes ago,</i>

416
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:32,593
<i>your only route to the port,
the Bowerneja bridge,</i>

417
00:49:32,617 --> 00:49:36,517
<i>was bombed. We are formulating an
escape plan now.</i>

418
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:39,541
<i>But untill then, you're on your own.</i>

419
00:49:39,565 --> 00:49:43,565
Set your watch.
The macimum time we can wait is 18 hours.

420
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:45,589
After that, we'll be forced to leave.

421
00:49:45,613 --> 00:49:47,513
My deepest apologies.

422
00:49:47,537 --> 00:49:49,537
I have the responsibility
to everyone onboard.

423
00:49:49,561 --> 00:49:51,561
I understand.

424
00:49:55,585 --> 00:49:57,585
You're going to the Chinese factory?

425
00:49:57,609 --> 00:49:59,609
We should go to the
Ameriacn Consulate.

426
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:02,533
The US marines are stationed there.
That's our safest bet.

427
00:50:03,557 --> 00:50:05,557
You think the US marines are
the best in the world?

428
00:50:06,581 --> 00:50:08,581
That may be true,
but where are they now?

429
00:50:09,505 --> 00:50:11,505
I've informed the
consulate of the situation.

430
00:50:11,529 --> 00:50:13,529
Where are they?

431
00:50:13,530 --> 00:50:14,930
Tell me exactly how you
informed them?

432
00:50:14,931 --> 00:50:17,531
I tweeted at them on Twitter.

433
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:26,555
<i>Welcome to American Consulate.</i>

434
00:50:26,579 --> 00:50:28,579
<i>Unfortunately, we are closed.</i>

435
00:50:28,603 --> 00:50:30,603
Fuck!

436
00:50:33,527 --> 00:50:35,527
All foreign navy ships have
left when I arrived.

437
00:50:36,557 --> 00:50:38,557
A I watch them sail away from port.

438
00:50:39,575 --> 00:50:41,575
Among the countless departing masts.

439
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:44,599
I saw one with the stars and stripes.

440
00:50:48,523 --> 00:50:50,523
Stop the car.

441
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,547
Stop the car!

442
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:54,571
Stop the car, I want to get out!
Stop!

443
00:51:10,595 --> 00:51:12,595
Rachel.

444
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:30,519
Your GIs are here to get you.

445
00:52:16,543 --> 00:52:19,343
<font color=#ffff00>Hanbond Chinese Factory</font>

446
00:52:54,567 --> 00:52:56,567
I'm Chinese.

447
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:58,591
I'm here for Nessa.

448
00:52:58,615 --> 00:53:00,615
Tundu's mom.

449
00:53:03,539 --> 00:53:05,539
Nessa!

450
00:53:16,563 --> 00:53:18,563
Anyone home?

451
00:53:18,587 --> 00:53:20,587
I've been sent here to rescue you.

452
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:22,611
By Ambassador Fan himself.

453
00:53:26,535 --> 00:53:28,535
You?

454
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,559
Rescue us?

455
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:41,583
I've got 18 AK-47s.

456
00:53:42,507 --> 00:53:44,507
30 M79 grenade launchers,

457
00:53:44,531 --> 00:53:47,531
enough to arm a platoon.

458
00:53:50,555 --> 00:53:53,555
I have a M1911 pointed
at your head right now.

459
00:53:54,579 --> 00:53:56,579
How the fuck are you supposed
to rescue us?

460
00:53:56,603 --> 00:53:58,603
Leng, Leng!
Are you Leng?

461
00:53:58,627 --> 00:54:00,627
Are you Leng?

462
00:54:00,651 --> 00:54:02,551
- Nessa?
- Yes, yes, yes!

463
00:54:02,575 --> 00:54:04,575
- What about my son?
- He's safe.

464
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:06,599
- He's okay?
- He's okay.

465
00:54:08,523 --> 00:54:10,523
Oh, thank god!

466
00:54:12,547 --> 00:54:14,547
He's okay.

467
00:54:14,571 --> 00:54:16,571
<i>Mom, mom, I'm ok, I'm ok!</i>

468
00:54:16,595 --> 00:54:19,595
Oh, thank god!
/ <i>Mom, I'm ok!</i>

469
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:22,519
Because you're on a Chinese warship.

470
00:54:22,543 --> 00:54:25,543
I told you,
not to sell that porn.

471
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:28,567
Here we go. You definitely won't find better
dumplings in Africa.

472
00:54:28,591 --> 00:54:30,591
I flew in a chef from China.

473
00:54:30,615 --> 00:54:32,615
- Fresh, just for you.
- Thank you.

474
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:36,539
What are you looking at?
Seen one before?

475
00:54:36,563 --> 00:54:38,563
Ever shot one of these?

476
00:54:38,587 --> 00:54:40,587
This wolf here,

477
00:54:40,611 --> 00:54:42,611
I killed myself with this gun.

478
00:54:43,535 --> 00:54:45,535
Who drew this map?

479
00:54:45,559 --> 00:54:47,719
I instructed our head of security,
Laohe, how to do it.

480
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:50,583
It still needs some work.

481
00:54:50,607 --> 00:54:52,607
Laohe, come here for a second.

482
00:54:54,531 --> 00:54:56,531
Sector A to Sector D.

483
00:54:56,555 --> 00:54:58,555
I've told you so many times.

484
00:54:59,579 --> 00:55:01,579
Why isn't it done yet?

485
00:55:02,503 --> 00:55:04,503
- I'll get on it right away.
- Laohe,

486
00:55:04,527 --> 00:55:06,527
write it down quickly.

487
00:55:06,551 --> 00:55:07,555
As our head of security.

488
00:55:07,585 --> 00:55:09,551
What if something happens
during the operation?

489
00:55:09,575 --> 00:55:11,575
Then what?

490
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,599
This is a real man's toy.

491
00:55:21,523 --> 00:55:24,523
Don't be afraid.
From now on, your safety

492
00:55:25,547 --> 00:55:27,547
- will be my responsibilty.
- Leng, thank you!

493
00:55:27,571 --> 00:55:29,571
- You're welcome.
- Thank you so much!

494
00:55:30,595 --> 00:55:32,595
You're welcome.

495
00:55:32,619 --> 00:55:34,619
Thank you.

496
00:55:35,543 --> 00:55:37,543
Hey, kiddo.
It's super yummy

497
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,567
try this.

498
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:42,591
- Hey! You brat!
- I'm fine. What's the big deal?

499
00:55:42,615 --> 00:55:44,615
I think she's kind of cute.

500
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:47,539
Good news.

501
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:49,563
Ambassador Fan just called.
Tomorrow 07:00 AM,

502
00:55:49,587 --> 00:55:51,587
A UN rescue helicopter

503
00:55:51,611 --> 00:55:53,611
will be landing at this factory
to evacuate us.

504
00:55:53,635 --> 00:55:55,635
Just one?

505
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:01,559
Attention please.

506
00:56:01,583 --> 00:56:03,583
Everybody.

507
00:56:03,607 --> 00:56:06,507
Everybody listen to me.

508
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:09,531
Quiet down everyone.

509
00:56:09,555 --> 00:56:14,555
Listen to me.
All Chinese employees, stand on this side.

510
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:18,579
We are only taking Chinese people.
Management goes first.

511
00:56:18,603 --> 00:56:20,503
I will lead the evacuation.

512
00:56:20,527 --> 00:56:21,649
Is that clear?

513
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:25,527
All the Africans please stand this side,
please.

514
00:56:25,551 --> 00:56:27,551
Clear?

515
00:56:27,575 --> 00:56:29,575
Harry.

516
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,599
- No, boss, no.
- Please.

517
00:56:31,623 --> 00:56:33,523
Come on, come on.

518
00:56:33,547 --> 00:56:35,547
Get moving.

519
00:56:37,571 --> 00:56:40,571
Anyone else?
Come, move. That side. That side.

520
00:56:42,595 --> 00:56:44,595
- What are you doing?
- She's my wife. She's pregnant.

521
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:44,907
Look.

522
00:56:44,948 --> 00:56:46,619
Any more Chinese?

523
00:56:47,543 --> 00:56:49,543
Any other Chinese?

524
00:56:49,567 --> 00:56:51,567
Lin, listen to me.

525
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:53,591
Everyone here is my employee.

526
00:56:53,615 --> 00:56:55,615
I'm taking them all with me.

527
00:56:58,539 --> 00:57:00,539
How?

528
00:57:03,563 --> 00:57:05,563
Come on, come on!
Don't stop, get moving.

529
00:57:05,587 --> 00:57:07,587
Get moving.
For this side,

530
00:57:07,611 --> 00:57:09,511
Fellow African.

531
00:57:09,535 --> 00:57:11,535
- Chinese people, this side.
- She married me.

532
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:13,559
So she's is one of us.

533
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:14,583
Move, move.

534
00:57:14,607 --> 00:57:16,607
You...

535
00:57:18,531 --> 00:57:20,531
Fine, stay there.
There's perfect.

536
00:57:20,555 --> 00:57:23,555
Come on! Come on!
Guys, guys please, please move.

537
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:26,579
Stand that side, please.

538
00:57:26,603 --> 00:57:29,503
Please, African friends.

539
00:57:29,527 --> 00:57:31,527
Trust me.

540
00:57:36,551 --> 00:57:38,551
Come on, hurry uo, get moving.

541
00:57:38,575 --> 00:57:40,575
- You want to be on this side, yeah?
- Fuck off, bro!

542
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:43,599
What's up?

543
00:57:43,623 --> 00:57:45,623
Why?

544
00:58:06,547 --> 00:58:08,547
Give a line down the middle.

545
00:58:08,571 --> 00:58:11,571
I want to see a clear boundary line.

546
00:58:11,595 --> 00:58:14,595
Show me the line, please.

547
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,519
I brought the helicopter.

548
00:58:22,543 --> 00:58:24,543
I call the shots.

549
00:58:25,567 --> 00:58:27,567
Everyone leaves tomorrow.

550
00:58:27,591 --> 00:58:29,591
Children and women leave
with the chopper.

551
00:58:29,615 --> 00:58:31,615
The men will follow me on foot.

552
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:38,539
Everybody.

553
00:58:40,563 --> 00:58:42,563
We leave together.

554
00:59:11,587 --> 00:59:13,587
Old timer,
the defensive formation out front,

555
00:59:13,611 --> 00:59:15,611
that was you, right?

556
00:59:16,535 --> 00:59:18,535
You're not bad yourself.

557
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,559
Former People's Liberation Army of China,
14th Corps, South-West region,

558
00:59:29,583 --> 00:59:31,583
Recon Company Commander,
He JianGuo.

559
00:59:32,507 --> 00:59:34,530
Former People's Liberation Army,
Special Ops Birgade, South-East region,

560
00:59:34,531 --> 00:59:36,531
Wolf Warrior Squadron, Leng Feng.

561
00:59:36,555 --> 00:59:38,555
At your service.

562
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:43,579
Drink in your honor.

563
00:59:55,503 --> 00:59:57,503
An hour ago, these people

564
00:59:57,527 --> 00:59:59,527
didn't know if they'd live
to see tomorrow.

565
00:59:59,551 --> 01:00:01,551
- Why are they so happy?
- Our African friends,

566
01:00:01,575 --> 01:00:03,575
it doesn't matter if it's war,

567
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:05,599
disease or poverty,

568
01:00:05,623 --> 01:00:08,523
once they're around the bonfire,
all their cares go away.

569
01:00:10,547 --> 01:00:12,547
Africa.
Great food.

570
01:00:13,571 --> 01:00:15,571
Nice scenery.

571
01:00:16,595 --> 01:00:18,595
Hot women.

572
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:55,519
Hey.

573
01:00:55,543 --> 01:00:57,543
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

574
01:01:02,567 --> 01:01:04,727
I don't want to ride my father's
coat tail all my life.

575
01:01:05,591 --> 01:01:07,591
I love this place!

576
01:01:07,615 --> 01:01:09,515
Lions, crocodiles,

577
01:01:09,539 --> 01:01:11,539
AK-47s, sniper rifles,

578
01:01:11,563 --> 01:01:14,563
and the melody of gunfire you
can't get in a peaceful country.

579
01:01:17,587 --> 01:01:19,587
That's the most wonderful
sound in the world.

580
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,511
Do you want to know why Pasha
bit you today?

581
01:01:24,535 --> 01:01:27,135
Because her father was killed
AK-47s you so adore.

582
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:33,559
If this were you,

583
01:01:34,583 --> 01:01:37,583
would you still thinl
it's wonderful?

584
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:01,507
Oh man, look at this.

585
01:02:01,531 --> 01:02:03,531
That's a big party.

586
01:02:14,555 --> 01:02:16,555
I love these things.

587
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:18,579
Look at them.

588
01:02:47,503 --> 01:02:48,503
Fuck!

589
01:02:48,527 --> 01:02:50,527
Pasha!

590
01:02:56,551 --> 01:02:58,551
Pasha!

591
01:03:15,575 --> 01:03:17,575
Shit!

592
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,599
Let me go!

593
01:03:31,623 --> 01:03:34,523
Take out the veteran.
Athena, take out the old man.

594
01:03:40,547 --> 01:03:42,547
Stay here!

595
01:03:46,571 --> 01:03:48,571
Let her go!

596
01:04:18,595 --> 01:04:20,595
Pasha!

597
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:25,519
Like ants when you lift a rock.

598
01:04:32,343 --> 01:04:34,343
Fuck!

599
01:04:52,567 --> 01:04:54,567
Help me!

600
01:04:54,591 --> 01:04:56,591
They got my leg!

601
01:04:57,515 --> 01:04:59,515
You're fine.

602
01:05:07,539 --> 01:05:09,539
Shit!

603
01:05:09,563 --> 01:05:11,563
Go!

604
01:05:13,587 --> 01:05:15,587
Go! Go!

605
01:06:11,511 --> 01:06:13,511
I need a reload!

606
01:06:15,535 --> 01:06:17,535
Go!

607
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:29,559
What are you doing, man?

608
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:37,583
Fuck!

609
01:06:46,507 --> 01:06:48,507
Let's split up!

610
01:06:53,531 --> 01:06:55,531
Go!
Go!

611
01:06:59,555 --> 01:07:01,555
Damn it.

612
01:07:04,579 --> 01:07:06,579
- Come on!
- Let's go!

613
01:07:28,503 --> 01:07:30,503
Pasha.

614
01:07:31,527 --> 01:07:33,527
Pasha, where are you?

615
01:07:40,551 --> 01:07:45,051
Move out of the way, bitch!

616
01:07:50,575 --> 01:07:52,575
Run!

617
01:08:58,599 --> 01:09:00,599
We know you're not a soldier anymore.

618
01:09:00,623 --> 01:09:03,523
What the fuck are you fighting for?

619
01:09:07,547 --> 01:09:09,547
Once a Wolf Warrior

620
01:09:09,571 --> 01:09:11,571
always a Wolf Warrior!

621
01:09:31,595 --> 01:09:33,595
Bear, you're on point.

622
01:09:33,619 --> 01:09:37,519
Athena, cover the exit.
I want this son of a bitch.

623
01:10:15,543 --> 01:10:18,543
Team Charlie, spotted target.
We are in pursuit.

624
01:10:19,567 --> 01:10:22,567
Sir, Team Bravo has target 12 o'clock.

625
01:11:16,591 --> 01:11:20,591
What the fuck? Those idiots want
us to retreat now?

626
01:11:35,515 --> 01:11:37,515
<i>This is General Actu</i>

627
01:11:37,539 --> 01:11:39,539
<i>everyone return to base.</i>

628
01:11:39,563 --> 01:11:41,563
<i>Return to base.</i>

629
01:11:44,587 --> 01:11:48,587
<i>Big Daddy, I'm ordering you
to get the fuck back here now!</i>

630
01:12:05,511 --> 01:12:07,511
Hey! What the fuck are you doing?

631
01:12:07,535 --> 01:12:09,535
I told you so many fucking times

632
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:12,559
that we cannot kill the Chinese!

633
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:16,583
China is a permanent member of the
UN Security Council.

634
01:12:17,507 --> 01:12:20,507
And I need them on my side if I am
to take political power.

635
01:12:20,531 --> 01:12:22,531
You fucking asshole!

636
01:12:30,555 --> 01:12:32,555
Kill Leng, and find Pasha,

637
01:12:32,579 --> 01:12:34,579
and you'll be the king of
this fucking country.

638
01:12:37,503 --> 01:12:39,503
As you comment, sir!

639
01:12:48,527 --> 01:12:50,527
- Hold it!
- Leng Feng!

640
01:12:54,551 --> 01:12:56,551
Who are you?

641
01:13:00,575 --> 01:13:02,552
We just fought a battle together,
what's your deal?

642
01:13:02,582 --> 01:13:03,135
Brither Fan

643
01:13:03,599 --> 01:13:05,599
we were pretty safe before
he got here.

644
01:13:05,623 --> 01:13:07,623
Ever wonder why the rebels
show up

645
01:13:07,647 --> 01:13:09,547
after he got here?

646
01:13:09,571 --> 01:13:11,571
He's a friend of my son.

647
01:13:11,595 --> 01:13:13,595
He came here for me.

648
01:13:13,619 --> 01:13:16,519
- Have you met him before?
- My son always talks about him.

649
01:13:17,543 --> 01:13:19,543
So?

650
01:13:19,567 --> 01:13:23,567
I trust him! He rescued Pasha
and me earlier today at the hospital.

651
01:13:23,591 --> 01:13:25,591
He's been protecting us ever since.

652
01:13:25,615 --> 01:13:27,515
Let me get this straight.

653
01:13:27,539 --> 01:13:30,539
You met him the same time
your doctor friend died?

654
01:13:30,563 --> 01:13:34,563
People are getting killed around him,
while he's unscathed.

655
01:13:35,587 --> 01:13:37,587
Friend, speak for yourself.

656
01:13:39,511 --> 01:13:41,511
Get off me!

657
01:13:54,535 --> 01:13:56,535
- Lamanla (Virus).
- Lamanla?

658
01:13:57,559 --> 01:13:59,559
He has Lamanla!

659
01:14:02,583 --> 01:14:04,583
Lin!
He's my friend.

660
01:14:07,507 --> 01:14:09,507
He just saved my life.

661
01:14:10,531 --> 01:14:12,531
What about them?

662
01:14:13,555 --> 01:14:15,555
What about them?
Last month,

663
01:14:15,579 --> 01:14:17,579
The comms center10 km away,

664
01:14:17,603 --> 01:14:21,503
one person got Lamanla.
In the end, the whole place was wiped out.

665
01:14:21,527 --> 01:14:23,527
Everyone's life is at stake here.

666
01:14:24,551 --> 01:14:26,551
Look, it is not just my opinion.

667
01:14:27,575 --> 01:14:29,575
Ask them yourself.

668
01:14:41,599 --> 01:14:43,599
I'll leave.

669
01:14:47,523 --> 01:14:49,523
Wait.

670
01:14:51,547 --> 01:14:54,547
You all know what will happen to
someone infected with Lamanla.

671
01:14:56,571 --> 01:14:58,571
I hope you'll always remember

672
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:02,595
this dying man saved all of you.

673
01:15:02,619 --> 01:15:04,519
Shame on you!

674
01:15:04,543 --> 01:15:06,543
Shame on all of you!

675
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:00,591
Leng Feng!

676
01:16:00,615 --> 01:16:02,615
Leng Feng!

677
01:16:02,639 --> 01:16:04,639
Leng Feng!

678
01:16:36,563 --> 01:16:38,563
- How confident are you with a gun?
- So-so.

679
01:16:38,587 --> 01:16:41,587
There's no place in my team
for so-so.

680
01:16:43,511 --> 01:16:45,511
Trying to get me drunk so
I blurt out the truth?

681
01:16:45,535 --> 01:16:47,535
Will you blurt out the truth?

682
01:16:47,559 --> 01:16:49,559
Certainly.

683
01:16:53,583 --> 01:16:55,583
What are you like when you're drunk?

684
01:16:55,607 --> 01:16:57,607
I'll let you buy me drinks
when you come back.

685
01:17:03,531 --> 01:17:05,531
You're the one who didn't
come back.

686
01:17:09,555 --> 01:17:11,555
Come back to bed.

687
01:17:11,579 --> 01:17:13,579
Cut it out.

688
01:17:22,503 --> 01:17:24,503
When I get back

689
01:17:24,527 --> 01:17:26,527
this had better be signed.

690
01:17:40,551 --> 01:17:42,551
It's an easy death when you're
on the attack.

691
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:47,575
But it's a hard life carrying
a survivor's guilt.

692
01:17:56,599 --> 01:17:58,599
But you didn't come back.

693
01:17:59,523 --> 01:18:01,523
It's you who didn't come back.

694
01:18:02,547 --> 01:18:04,547
You didn't come back.

695
01:18:22,571 --> 01:18:24,571
Against who?

696
01:18:24,595 --> 01:18:26,595
Who were we fighting yesterday?

697
01:18:39,519 --> 01:18:41,519
Didn't your mom tell you that

698
01:18:41,543 --> 01:18:43,543
you shouldn't play with a gun?

699
01:18:47,567 --> 01:18:49,567
Leng!

700
01:18:50,591 --> 01:18:52,591
That was Leng, only him alone.

701
01:18:54,515 --> 01:18:56,515
It was me!

702
01:18:58,539 --> 01:19:01,539
I was in the military before I worked here.

703
01:19:01,563 --> 01:19:03,563
Does anyone here

704
01:19:03,587 --> 01:19:05,587
look like they can shoot?

705
01:19:05,611 --> 01:19:07,611
Okay.

706
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:31,535
You're up.

707
01:19:34,559 --> 01:19:37,559
It's a shame Dr. Chen didn't live
to see this.

708
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:40,583
He discovered the presence of self-healing
properties in humans.

709
01:19:40,607 --> 01:19:44,507
In extreme rare cases, Lamanla
antibodies can be found in patients.

710
01:19:44,531 --> 01:19:48,531
Among the thousands of Lamanla
patients he treated.

711
01:19:48,555 --> 01:19:50,555
He chanced upon one such person.

712
01:19:51,579 --> 01:19:53,579
And that person is Pasha.

713
01:19:54,503 --> 01:19:57,503
So Pasha's not his daughter,
but his patient.

714
01:19:57,527 --> 01:20:00,527
From the analysis of Pasha's blood

715
01:20:00,551 --> 01:20:03,551
he created an experimental vaccine.

716
01:20:03,575 --> 01:20:05,575
Last night was a dire situation,

717
01:20:05,599 --> 01:20:08,599
so I experimented on you,
what Dr. Chen was planning to do.

718
01:20:08,623 --> 01:20:11,523
The first human trial that
he was hoping for.

719
01:20:11,547 --> 01:20:14,547
Injecting you with Dr. Chen's
newly synthesized vaccine immunogens.

720
01:20:15,571 --> 01:20:17,571
Honestly speaking,

721
01:20:17,595 --> 01:20:19,595
I didn't know what would happen.

722
01:20:22,519 --> 01:20:24,519
Luckily.

723
01:20:24,543 --> 01:20:26,543
God was on your side.

724
01:20:33,567 --> 01:20:38,567
The population has lost faith in the
government to contain the outbreak.

725
01:20:38,591 --> 01:20:40,591
So, whoever takes Pasha

726
01:20:40,615 --> 01:20:42,515
takes the country easily.

727
01:20:42,539 --> 01:20:45,539
That explains why the rebel army
is hot on our heels.

728
01:21:07,563 --> 01:21:10,563
My dad said man walked out of
Africa 100.000 years ago.

729
01:21:10,587 --> 01:21:13,587
Africa is the cradle of modern civilization.

730
01:21:13,611 --> 01:21:16,511
Yet when the "evolved, civilized"
humans returned to this land,

731
01:21:16,535 --> 01:21:18,535
they brought along with them
nothing but suffering,

732
01:21:18,559 --> 01:21:20,559
slavery, disease and war.

733
01:21:21,583 --> 01:21:25,583
Koreans, Icelanders, Slavs,

734
01:21:25,607 --> 01:21:27,507
Americans

735
01:21:27,531 --> 01:21:30,531
and over there are Chinese.
People from all over the world,

736
01:21:30,555 --> 01:21:32,555
people like my father.

737
01:21:33,579 --> 01:21:35,579
For Africa

738
01:21:35,603 --> 01:21:38,503
they gave their best years.

739
01:21:38,527 --> 01:21:40,527
In the end,

740
01:21:40,551 --> 01:21:43,551
they got to remain here for eternity.

741
01:21:54,575 --> 01:21:56,575
What's her name?

742
01:21:56,599 --> 01:21:58,599
Huh?

743
01:21:58,623 --> 01:22:00,623
The person you can't seem to forget.

744
01:22:04,547 --> 01:22:06,547
Long XiaoYun.

745
01:22:09,571 --> 01:22:11,571
She's lucky

746
01:22:12,595 --> 01:22:14,595
to have a man that loves her so much.

747
01:22:15,519 --> 01:22:17,519
Why didn't she come back?

748
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:30,543
Sorry.

749
01:22:49,567 --> 01:22:52,590
I want you to round 'em up like cattle.
Make 'em feel safe. You understand me?

750
01:22:52,591 --> 01:22:54,591
Yes, sir.

751
01:23:04,515 --> 01:23:06,515
We got mountains to the west,

752
01:23:06,539 --> 01:23:07,622
we got forests to the east.

753
01:23:07,652 --> 01:23:09,639
The only smart place for
them to come is right here

754
01:23:09,669 --> 01:23:11,100
and wait for the rescue helicopter.

755
01:23:11,563 --> 01:23:13,563
I sure hope these Chinese people don't die.

756
01:23:14,587 --> 01:23:16,707
I'm about the only thing that can
save them right now.

757
01:23:22,511 --> 01:23:24,511
Round 'em up.

758
01:23:24,535 --> 01:23:27,535
Everybody, let's go! Let's go!
Move, move, move!

759
01:23:42,559 --> 01:23:44,559
Wait till I get out of here,

760
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:46,583
I'm going to settle the score with them.

761
01:23:47,507 --> 01:23:49,507
Brother Fan,

762
01:23:49,531 --> 01:23:51,531
cut the fucking bullshit.

763
01:23:52,555 --> 01:23:54,555
How are we going to get out?

764
01:23:55,579 --> 01:23:58,579
And besides,
what are you planning to do?

765
01:23:58,603 --> 01:24:00,503
What can you even do?

766
01:24:00,527 --> 01:24:02,527
Brother Fan,

767
01:24:02,551 --> 01:24:04,551
in normal times, everyone
gives in to you.

768
01:24:05,575 --> 01:24:09,575
In battle,
no one will be giving in to us.

769
01:24:09,599 --> 01:24:11,599
Shut the fuck up!

770
01:25:23,523 --> 01:25:25,523
Go to hell!

771
01:25:44,547 --> 01:25:46,547
Brother, how are you holding up?

772
01:25:46,571 --> 01:25:48,571
Not as well as back in the day.

773
01:25:53,595 --> 01:25:56,595
Your hands are for saving lives
not taking lives.

774
01:26:14,519 --> 01:26:16,519
How would Wolf Warriors fight
this battle?

775
01:27:00,543 --> 01:27:02,543
Go!

776
01:27:05,567 --> 01:27:07,567
Go!

777
01:28:27,591 --> 01:28:31,591
Didn't your mom tell you not to
play with weap?

778
01:28:37,515 --> 01:28:39,538
Didn't your mom tell you not
to fuck with spoiled brats?

779
01:28:39,539 --> 01:28:41,539
Let's go!

780
01:29:05,563 --> 01:29:07,586
Here's evidence of the rebel
army killing our citizens.

781
01:29:07,587 --> 01:29:10,587
Transmission received.
<i>We will gather up all the information,</i>

782
01:29:10,611 --> 01:29:12,611
and have Ambassador Fan
submit it to the UN.

783
01:29:13,535 --> 01:29:14,535
Copy that.

784
01:29:14,559 --> 01:29:16,337
<i>Oh and one more thing.
The local government</i>

785
01:29:16,367 --> 01:29:18,559
<i>has critically requested for
our military assistance.</i>

786
01:29:18,583 --> 01:29:21,583
<i>The chopper will arrive shortly.</i>

787
01:29:21,607 --> 01:29:23,607
- We're waiting for you.
- Copy that!

788
01:29:31,531 --> 01:29:33,531
<font color=#ffff00>UNITED NATIONS</font>

789
01:29:39,555 --> 01:29:40,606
Get on the chopper

790
01:29:40,636 --> 01:29:43,555
There're a lot of people
here who still need me.

791
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:46,579
Lin Zhi Xiong!

792
01:29:48,503 --> 01:29:50,442
Women and childern
must get on the chopper.

793
01:29:50,472 --> 01:29:52,503
Right now I'm not a woman. I'm a doctor

794
01:29:52,527 --> 01:29:54,550
The more professional than
you when it comes to saving lives.

795
01:29:54,551 --> 01:29:56,711
But I'm more professional than
you in protecting lives!

796
01:29:57,575 --> 01:29:59,575
Pasha, are you ready to
get on the helicopter?

797
01:30:00,599 --> 01:30:02,599
Can you pass me some gauze please?

798
01:30:04,523 --> 01:30:06,523
Get on the helicopter.

799
01:30:06,547 --> 01:30:09,547
Don't be difficult, okay?

800
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:12,571
- Excuse me?
- Excuse you my ass!

801
01:30:48,595 --> 01:30:50,595
Whoa, what was that?

802
01:30:52,519 --> 01:30:54,519
Mayday! Mayday!

803
01:30:54,543 --> 01:30:56,543
Missile strike! Tail rotor lost!

804
01:30:56,567 --> 01:30:58,567
I have control.
Going down!

805
01:30:58,591 --> 01:31:00,591
Mayday! Mayday!

806
01:31:02,515 --> 01:31:04,515
Brace! Brace!

807
01:31:41,539 --> 01:31:43,539
- Go! Go!
- Go!

808
01:31:44,563 --> 01:31:46,563
Run!

809
01:32:02,587 --> 01:32:04,587
To the bunker!

810
01:32:04,611 --> 01:32:06,611
Hurry!

811
01:32:11,535 --> 01:32:13,535
Rachel!

812
01:32:15,559 --> 01:32:17,559
Wake up!

813
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:23,583
Come on! Come on!

814
01:32:39,507 --> 01:32:41,507
Rachel!

815
01:32:52,531 --> 01:32:54,531
Go find LaoHe!

816
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:24,555
Get up! Come on!

817
01:33:30,579 --> 01:33:32,579
Fuck!

818
01:33:33,503 --> 01:33:35,503
Get to the bunker!

819
01:33:59,527 --> 01:34:01,527
Go! Quickly!
Go!

820
01:34:01,551 --> 01:34:03,551
Go! Quickly!

821
01:34:22,575 --> 01:34:24,575
Get ready!

822
01:34:35,599 --> 01:34:37,599
Fire!

823
01:34:38,523 --> 01:34:40,523
Kill that motherfucker!

824
01:34:42,547 --> 01:34:44,547
Reload!

825
01:34:49,571 --> 01:34:51,571
I can't aim.

826
01:34:51,595 --> 01:34:53,595
- This thing's so heavy!
- You wanna die!?

827
01:34:54,519 --> 01:34:56,519
Trigger that fuse and
it'll kill us all!

828
01:35:12,543 --> 01:35:14,543
Fire!

829
01:35:58,567 --> 01:36:00,567
Oh, check it.

830
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:05,591
Three clicks down.

831
01:36:13,515 --> 01:36:15,515
Fire!

832
01:36:58,539 --> 01:37:00,539
They found the bunker!

833
01:37:03,563 --> 01:37:05,563
I got it! I got it!
To the left.

834
01:37:05,587 --> 01:37:07,587
- Copy that.
- Reload!

835
01:37:07,611 --> 01:37:09,611
We're out!

836
01:37:19,535 --> 01:37:21,535
Hang on!

837
01:37:28,559 --> 01:37:30,559
Fire!

838
01:38:25,583 --> 01:38:27,583
Son of a bitch!

839
01:38:47,507 --> 01:38:50,507
Fuck!
Move this fucking thing.

840
01:39:05,531 --> 01:39:07,531
Come on! Come on!

841
01:39:10,555 --> 01:39:12,555
Good, good, good.

842
01:39:43,579 --> 01:39:45,579
Fuck!

843
01:39:48,503 --> 01:39:51,503
I guess the Chinese military
ain't as lame as I thought.

844
01:39:51,527 --> 01:39:53,527
Cut the crap.

845
01:40:00,551 --> 01:40:02,551
Go!

846
01:40:02,575 --> 01:40:04,575
Go!

847
01:40:29,599 --> 01:40:31,599
Hurry!

848
01:43:49,523 --> 01:43:51,523
Don't come out!

849
01:43:56,547 --> 01:43:58,547
Track the signals and verify
targets positions!

850
01:44:24,571 --> 01:44:26,571
Godfather!

851
01:44:26,595 --> 01:44:30,595
Mom!

852
01:45:17,519 --> 01:45:19,459
Sir, we have triangulated
on the phone's position!

853
01:45:19,489 --> 01:45:20,519
Sir, targets locked on!

854
01:45:56,543 --> 01:45:59,543
- Sir, we recieved orders from COMMAND!
- Fire!

855
01:48:14,567 --> 01:48:16,567
Now it's personal.

856
01:48:20,591 --> 01:48:22,591
Long XiaoYun.

857
01:48:29,515 --> 01:48:31,515
Is that your girl?

858
01:48:32,539 --> 01:48:34,539
She's pretty.

859
01:48:34,563 --> 01:48:36,563
Blood...
for blood.

860
01:50:32,587 --> 01:50:34,587
Please don't fight!

861
01:50:38,511 --> 01:50:40,511
Look at them.

862
01:50:42,535 --> 01:50:45,535
You're gonna die for this people.

863
01:50:51,559 --> 01:50:54,559
I was born for them.

864
01:50:58,583 --> 01:51:02,583
People like you will always
be inferior to people like me.

865
01:51:02,607 --> 01:51:05,507
Get used to it.
Get fucking used to it.

866
01:51:43,531 --> 01:51:45,531
That's fucking history.

867
01:52:26,555 --> 01:52:28,555
Welcome back.

868
01:53:25,579 --> 01:53:28,579
The war zone is up ahead.
We can't get through.

869
01:53:53,503 --> 01:53:57,503
UNidentified vehicle convoy
at three o'clock.

870
01:54:06,527 --> 01:54:08,527
Brother,

871
01:54:08,551 --> 01:54:10,551
pass me the flag.

872
01:54:38,575 --> 01:54:40,575
Drive.

873
01:55:00,599 --> 01:55:02,599
It's the Chinese.
Hold your fire.

874
01:55:05,523 --> 01:55:10,523
Hold your fire!
It's Chinese.

875
01:57:54,572 --> 01:57:56,572
<i>Leng Feng.</i>

876
01:57:59,596 --> 01:58:01,596
- Commander!
- <i>I see you're enjoying your life.</i>

877
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:04,520
Not planning on rejoining
the Wolf Warriors?

878
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:06,544
Sir, the earliest flight out of here,

879
01:58:06,568 --> 01:58:09,568
departs next Tuesday at 14:15
by Friday 09:00.

880
01:58:09,592 --> 01:58:11,592
I will report for duty sir!

881
01:58:12,516 --> 01:58:14,516
There's something I need to tell you...
