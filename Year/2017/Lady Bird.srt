00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:04,698
I hate California. I want
to go to the east coast.

3
00:00:04,733 --> 00:00:06,342
I want to go where
culture is like New York.

4
00:00:06,377 --> 00:00:08,031
How in the world did
I raise such a snob?

5
00:00:08,066 --> 00:00:09,685
Or at least Connecticut or New Hampshire

6
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,483
or where writers live in the woods.

7
00:00:10,518 --> 00:00:12,536
You can't even get in
those schools anyway.

8
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:13,334
Mom!

9
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:14,167
You should just go to city college.

10
00:00:14,202 --> 00:00:16,131
You know? With your work
ethic, just go to city college

11
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:18,342
and then to jail, and
then back to city college

12
00:00:18,377 --> 00:00:20,272
and maybe you'd learn to pull yourself up

13
00:00:20,307 --> 00:00:22,168
and not expect everybody
to do everything...

14
00:00:23,492 --> 00:00:25,952
Lady Bird... Is that your given name?

15
00:00:25,987 --> 00:00:26,750
Yeah.

16
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:27,812
Why is it in quotes?

17
00:00:27,847 --> 00:00:30,599
I gave it to myself,
it's given to me by me.

18
00:00:30,634 --> 00:00:32,304
Lady Bird always says
that she lives in the wrong

19
00:00:32,339 --> 00:00:33,974
side of the tracks, but
I always thought that

20
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:35,116
that was like a metaphor.

21
00:00:35,151 --> 00:00:37,676
But there are actual train tracks.

22
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,096
What you do is very baller.

23
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:41,465
It's very anarchist.

24
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,800
Put the magazine back.

25
00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:45,906
She has a big heart, your mom.

26
00:00:45,941 --> 00:00:47,804
She's warm but she's also kind of scary.

27
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,272
You can't be scary and warm.

28
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:50,705
I think you can. Your mom is.

29
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:54,747
So you're not interested
in any catholic colleges?

30
00:00:54,782 --> 00:00:55,545
No way.

31
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,310
I want schools like Yale,
but not Yale because

32
00:00:58,345 --> 00:00:59,439
I probably couldn't get in.

33
00:01:01,663 --> 00:01:03,649
You definitely couldn't get in.

34
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:05,280
Does mom hate me?

35
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,175
If you're tired we can sit down.

36
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:07,077
I'm not tired.

37
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:08,235
You were dragging your feet.

38
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,231
You are so infuriating.

39
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:10,302
Please stop yelling.

40
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:11,440
I'm not yelling.

41
00:01:11,475 --> 00:01:12,624
Oh it's perfect!

42
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:13,739
Do you love it?

43
00:01:13,774 --> 00:01:16,939
You both have such strong personalities.

44
00:01:21,292 --> 00:01:24,243
When is a normal time to have sex?

45
00:01:24,278 --> 00:01:25,540
You're having sex?

46
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:26,989
I'm ready.

47
00:01:27,024 --> 00:01:28,797
I just wanted it to be special.

48
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,595
Why?

49
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,162
You're gonna have so much
unspecial sex in your life.

50
00:01:34,872 --> 00:01:37,957
We're afraid that we
will never escape our past.

51
00:01:37,992 --> 00:01:39,571
Whatever we give you, it's never enough.

52
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:40,898
It's never enough.

53
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:42,155
It is enough.

54
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,042
We're afraid of
what the future will bring...

55
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:46,765
We're afraid
we won't be loved...

56
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,655
You can't do anything unless you're

57
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,050
the center of attention!

58
00:01:50,883 --> 00:01:51,681
You won't be liked...

59
00:01:51,716 --> 00:01:53,938
Yeah well you know your moms
tits, they're totally fake!

60
00:01:53,973 --> 00:01:56,222
She made one bad decision at 19.

61
00:01:56,257 --> 00:01:57,251
Two bad decisions!

62
00:01:57,286 --> 00:01:59,142
And we won't succeed.

63
00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:02,721
I want you to be the very
best version of yourself

64
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:03,692
that you can be.

65
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,171
What if this is the best version?

66
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:19,486
What I'd really like is
to be on math olympiad.

67
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:22,699
But math isn't something
you're terribly strong in.

68
00:02:22,734 --> 00:02:24,254
That we know of yet.
