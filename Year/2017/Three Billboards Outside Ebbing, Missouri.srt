1
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,359
You Red Welby?

2
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,671
Yes, ma'am. How may I help you?

3
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,698
I heard there's three billboards
out on Drinkwater Road...

4
00:03:50,722 --> 00:03:52,299
you're in charge of renting
them out, that right?

5
00:03:52,324 --> 00:03:54,643
I didn't know we had any billboards
out on Drinkwater...

6
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:57,370
- Where is Drinkwater Road?
- there's a Road out past the Sizemore got put in.

7
00:03:57,395 --> 00:03:59,840
Turn-off nobody uses
since the highway,

8
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:07,692
You are right.

9
00:04:07,717 --> 00:04:12,252
Got three billboards out there. Nobody's
put nothing up out there since... 1986.

10
00:04:13,179 --> 00:04:14,421
That was 'Huggies'.

11
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:16,590
How much to rent out
all three of 'em the year?

12
00:04:17,246 --> 00:04:18,458
A year?

13
00:04:19,046 --> 00:04:21,628
You wanna pay for three billboards
on a road no-one goes down

14
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:23,997
unless they got lost or they're retards,
for a year?

15
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:25,398
Quick, ain't ya, Welby?

16
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,268
Well...

17
00:04:29,262 --> 00:04:32,873
since what I say goes these days
down at the Ebbing Advertising Desk,

18
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,575
I'm gonna strike you a real
good deal on those billboards,

19
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,345
now, what was it you said
your name was, Mrs...?

20
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:40,514
What's the law on what ya can
and cannot say on a billboard?

21
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:43,325
I assume it's ya can't
say nothing defamatory,

22
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,390
and ya can't say, 'Fuck' 'Piss' or 'Cunt'.
That right?

23
00:04:48,575 --> 00:04:49,689
Or...

24
00:04:50,435 --> 00:04:51,458
Anus.

25
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,327
Well I think I'll be alright then.

26
00:04:56,906 --> 00:04:59,966
Here's five thousand for the first month.
I assume that'll cover it.

27
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,203
Here's what the billboards oughta say.

28
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:05,728
Why don't ya draw up a little contract
betwixt us while you're at it,

29
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:08,241
make sure nobody rents them
billboards out from under me?

30
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:15,816
I guess you're Angela Hayes' mother.

31
00:05:15,841 --> 00:05:18,886
That's right, I'm Angela Hayes' mother.

32
00:05:24,688 --> 00:05:26,193
Name's Mildred.

33
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,629
How long before you've got 'em put up?

34
00:05:30,995 --> 00:05:33,567
Oh, shall we say by...

35
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:35,502
Easter Sunday?

36
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:38,238
That'd be perfect.

37
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,850
- Hey! What the hell's this?!
- Que?

38
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:27,554
- “How come Chief Willoughby?” what?
- What?

39
00:06:27,576 --> 00:06:28,855
- Yeah!
- Huh!

40
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,124
How come what?

41
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:32,209
What?!

42
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:35,762
Listen, I better start getting
some straight answers outta you

43
00:06:35,787 --> 00:06:37,197
you Put that down.

44
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,727
What the Hell is this?

45
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:09,229
Hey you?

46
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:10,864
What the fuck is this?

47
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,934
- What the fuck is what?
- This! This!

48
00:07:17,573 --> 00:07:20,273
- Advertising, I guess.
- Advertising what?

49
00:07:27,646 --> 00:07:28,949
Something obscure?

50
00:07:29,843 --> 00:07:31,885
I'll say! Yeah!

51
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:34,621
Don't I know your face from some place?

52
00:07:35,726 --> 00:07:38,024
- I dunno, do ya?
- Yeah.

53
00:07:38,193 --> 00:07:39,960
Yeah, I do.

54
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,798
I could arrest you right
now, if I wanted to.

55
00:07:44,823 --> 00:07:48,335
- For what?
- For... emptying out your bucket there. It's against the...

56
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,670
being bad against the environment laws.

57
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:53,406
Before you do that,

58
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:55,041
Officer Dixon,

59
00:07:55,294 --> 00:07:58,545
How about you go have yourself a look
at that first billboard over there,

60
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,615
and then we can have ourself a conversation
about the motherfucking environment.

61
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,290
How about that?

62
00:08:23,482 --> 00:08:24,838
Fuck me.

63
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:29,642
Don't...

64
00:08:33,955 --> 00:08:38,485
Dixon, you goddam asshole, I'm
in the middle of my goddam Easter dinner...

65
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:40,409
Sorry, kids.

66
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:44,057
I know, Chief, and I'm sorry for
calling ya at home and all, but uh,

67
00:08:44,863 --> 00:08:47,293
I think we've got kind of a problem...

68
00:10:08,174 --> 00:10:10,043
No. No. Go back.

69
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:11,654
Alright.

70
00:10:34,131 --> 00:10:36,136
Sorry I'm late, Denise.

71
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:38,505
Did you put up those
billboards to fuck with the cops yet?

72
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,627
They're up.

73
00:10:39,651 --> 00:10:42,542
You go, girl! You go fuck those cops up!

74
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:47,313
What the fuck do you think you're
doing, Welby, buncha billboards like that,

75
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:49,616
you didn't think there'd be some
kinda ramifications? Legally?

76
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:51,084
What's the legal ramifications, Cedric?

77
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:54,287
You want me to explain the legal
ramifications, a little punk like you?

78
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:56,158
And don't call me Cedric.

79
00:10:56,183 --> 00:10:59,705
Ain't contravening no laws on propriety, ain't
contravening no laws on any fucking thing.

80
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:02,077
- I checked all this up.
- Oh yeah, where'd you check all this up?

81
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:03,102
In a...

82
00:11:03,857 --> 00:11:06,097
- book.
- Which book, genius?

83
00:11:06,122 --> 00:11:09,008
Book called 'Suck my ass,
it's none o' your business'.

84
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,108
Fuck.

85
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,944
How long has this person, or persons,

86
00:11:17,969 --> 00:11:19,846
rented these billboards out for?

87
00:11:21,284 --> 00:11:22,682
Oh, the year.

88
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,685
And how long she actually paid for?

89
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:27,687
The year.

90
00:11:27,923 --> 00:11:30,290
So it's a she, isn't?

91
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:35,321
Ain't at liberty to divulge
that kinda information, Chief.

92
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:39,666
Mildred Hayes, perhaps?

93
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,403
Ain't at liberty to divulge
that kinda information, Chief.

94
00:11:43,428 --> 00:11:46,806
Do you really wanna fuck with the
Ebbing Police Department, Red?

95
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:48,341
Do ya?

96
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:50,710
I guess.

97
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:54,743
- He said what?! To your face?!
- No crime has been committed here.

98
00:11:54,768 --> 00:11:56,975
C'mon Defamation of
character ain't a crime?

99
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,619
It isn't defamation if she's
simply asking a question.

100
00:11:59,644 --> 00:12:02,137
- What are you, an idiot?
- Don't call me an idiot, Dixon.

101
00:12:02,162 --> 00:12:04,724
I didn't call you an idiot. I asked if
you was an idiot. It was a question.

102
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:06,459
He got ya, Cedric!

103
00:12:06,484 --> 00:12:09,696
- That's it. C'mon man.
- Don't go fly off the handle!

104
00:12:09,721 --> 00:12:12,428
- Why in hell you keep that man on?
- He's a good man. At heart.

105
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:15,802
- He tortured a guy in custody, Bill.
- There was no...

106
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:18,104
real evidence to support that.

107
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,307
Take 'em down.

108
00:12:21,672 --> 00:12:23,710
- Hah?
- Take that shit down.

109
00:12:23,735 --> 00:12:25,745
- Take what shit down?
- Hey boy.

110
00:12:26,395 --> 00:12:28,615
You think I wouldn't take you out,
right here on Main Street, Red?

111
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,715
I Thought you only take
out black dudes, Dixon...

112
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,619
That's it. No no.

113
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:36,055
Stop it! Don't; you ever fucking
touch me, you motherfucker.

114
00:12:38,187 --> 00:12:39,187
Are you drunk?

115
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:41,527
Are you drunk right now?
- Get up

116
00:12:44,469 --> 00:12:46,866
nobody never goes down that road, anyways.

117
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,049
Unless they got lost, or they're retards.

118
00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:53,840
Well, don't be nervous, is the main
thing, and it'll go just fine.

119
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:57,377
Don't look into the camera, obviously.
Let's hold for this car.

120
00:12:59,574 --> 00:13:02,021
In three, two, one.

121
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,617
So, Mildred Hayes, why did
you put up these billboards?

122
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:09,102
Well, my daughter, Angela, she got abducted, and
she got raped and murdered seven months ago,

123
00:13:09,127 --> 00:13:10,973
on this self-same stretch o' road here,

124
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,359
Whatcha watching, Momma? The stupid news?

125
00:13:13,384 --> 00:13:17,430
It seems like the local police department is
too busy goin' round torturing black folks

126
00:13:17,479 --> 00:13:20,667
to be bothered doing anything
about solving actual crime,

127
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,270
I thought these here billboards
might concentrate their minds some.

128
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:25,370
Fuck.

129
00:13:26,193 --> 00:13:28,386
I don't know what the police are
doing, to be honest with you.

130
00:13:28,411 --> 00:13:31,244
I do know my daughter's burnt body

131
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:35,048
is lying six feet under the ground
while they're eating Krispy Kremes

132
00:13:35,073 --> 00:13:38,017
and busting eight year-olds for
skateboarding in parking lots.

133
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,820
And Chief Willoughby, why single him out?

134
00:13:40,924 --> 00:13:43,990
Well, he's the head of 'em, ain't he?
The buck's gotta stop at somewhere.

135
00:13:44,004 --> 00:13:45,453
And the buck stops at Willoughby?

136
00:13:45,478 --> 00:13:48,034
Yeah, the buck stops at Willoughby.
Dead right it does.

137
00:14:03,373 --> 00:14:04,911
You alright there, fella?

138
00:14:07,219 --> 00:14:09,916
Looks like we got a war on our hands.

139
00:14:33,598 --> 00:14:34,707
Can we talk?

140
00:14:40,856 --> 00:14:43,783
I'd do anything to catch the
guy who did it, Mrs. Hayes.

141
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:47,408
But when the DNA don't match
no-one who's ever been arrested,

142
00:14:47,433 --> 00:14:51,324
and when the DNA don't match
any other crime nationwide,

143
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:55,322
and when there wasn't a single eyewitness
from the time she left your house

144
00:14:55,347 --> 00:14:57,287
to the time we found her, well,

145
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,433
right now there ain't too
much more that we can do

146
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:04,203
you Could pull blood from every
man and boy in this town,

147
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:05,838
over the age of eight.

148
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,243
There's civil rights laws
prevents that, Mrs. Hayes,

149
00:15:10,268 --> 00:15:12,378
and what if he was just
passing thru town...

150
00:15:12,403 --> 00:15:14,116
Pull blood from ever' man
in the country, then.

151
00:15:14,141 --> 00:15:16,449
And what if he was just
passing thru the country?

152
00:15:16,474 --> 00:15:17,917
If it was me,

153
00:15:17,942 --> 00:15:19,485
I'd start up a database,

154
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,192
every male baby what's
born, stick 'em on it,

155
00:15:22,217 --> 00:15:25,558
and as soon as they done something
wrong, cross reference it

156
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,327
make a hundred percent certain
it was a correct match,

157
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:29,729
then kill 'em.

158
00:15:31,918 --> 00:15:33,841
Yeah, well, there's

159
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:36,762
definitely civil rights laws prevents that.

160
00:15:40,096 --> 00:15:43,543
I'm doing everything I
can to track him down,

161
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:47,280
I don't think those
billboards is very fair.

162
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:50,492
The time it's took you to get out here
whining like a bitch, Willoughby,

163
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:52,919
some other poor girl's probably out
there being butchered right now,

164
00:15:52,944 --> 00:15:55,521
but I'm glad you've got your priorities
straight, I'll say that for ya.

165
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:06,285
There's something else, Mildred.

166
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:12,705
I got cancer.

167
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,075
- I'm dying.
- I know it.

168
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,045
Huh?

169
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,949
I know it. Most everybody in town knows it.

170
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:30,361
Then you still putting
up those billboard?

171
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:34,060
Well, they wouldn't be as
effective after you croak, right?

172
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,769
Well looky looky,

173
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:20,814
if it ain't the instigator of this whole
goddam affair in the first place...

174
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,775
I didn't instigate shit, Dixon...

175
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,111
Playing pool against the town midget.

176
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:28,281
He's right, Red, you are playing
pool against the town midget.

177
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:30,449
Well he's a cop, y'know, he's observant.

178
00:17:30,723 --> 00:17:32,785
You know, I always disliked you, Red,

179
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:36,130
ever since you was a snotty little child,

180
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,850
which you still look like.
A snotty little child.

181
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:40,560
Well that's unfortunate.
I always thought you was great.

182
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:43,462
Even your name, 'Red Welby'.

183
00:17:44,163 --> 00:17:46,732
Even your name I disliked.

184
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,957
Well... okay.

185
00:17:48,982 --> 00:17:52,662
Like you was some kind of a
goddam Communist or something,

186
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,807
- and proud of it.
- No,

187
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:57,376
it's cos I got red hair.

188
00:17:57,752 --> 00:18:00,313
Do you know what they do to
fagots down in Cuba, Welby?

189
00:18:00,852 --> 00:18:02,356
Wow, that's left-field...

190
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,585
No, what do they do to
fagots down in Cuba, Dixon?

191
00:18:05,805 --> 00:18:07,053
They kill 'em!

192
00:18:07,248 --> 00:18:10,256
Which, it might surprise you
to learn, I am against.

193
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,601
I'm not sure if they do kill
fagots down in Cuba, Dixon.

194
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,228
I know Cuba's human rights
record is pretty deplorable

195
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:19,465
when it comes to homosexuality,
but killing 'em?

196
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,169
Are you sure you ain't thinking of Wyoming?

197
00:18:23,546 --> 00:18:26,544
Always with the smart-ass...
- Jesus.

198
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:28,622
He's quite good, isn't he?

199
00:18:32,598 --> 00:18:34,714
Willoughby's a good man. Hey look at me.

200
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:37,950
Hey look at me.
I'm talking nice to you now, am I?

201
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:39,552
I'm talking nice to you.

202
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:44,523
He shouldn't have this be the
only thing he thinks about,

203
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,559
the last months left to him.

204
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,562
The last months what?

205
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,134
Oh. You didn't know.

206
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:59,005
Yeah. Pancreatic.

207
00:18:59,029 --> 00:19:00,306
I'm up next

208
00:19:00,469 --> 00:19:02,375
if any of you ole ladies ever quit yakking.

209
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,276
- Rude.
- Hey Mildred.

210
00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:07,279
Saw you on TV the other day.

211
00:19:07,304 --> 00:19:09,181
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah, you looked good.

212
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:11,250
I mean, y'know,

213
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:14,887
you came across really good,
in the things you were saying.

214
00:19:14,944 --> 00:19:17,857
I didn't think you came across really
good in the things you were saying.

215
00:19:17,882 --> 00:19:20,493
I thought you came across stupid-ass.

216
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,229
Ain't it about time you got
home to your momma, Dixon?

217
00:19:23,542 --> 00:19:26,666
No it ain't time I got home to my momma.

218
00:19:26,691 --> 00:19:30,336
I told her I was gonna be
out 'til twelve. Actually.

219
00:19:30,764 --> 00:19:31,937
Jesus!

220
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:39,779
Me versus. You, Mildred!

221
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:44,984
Hey Robbie? I think that midget
wants to get in my pants...

222
00:19:45,453 --> 00:19:46,692
Father Montgomery.

223
00:19:48,055 --> 00:19:52,644
Mildred. I'm sorry for
calling on you so late, but.

224
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:56,702
I must say Robbie's been
the consummate host.

225
00:19:57,396 --> 00:20:02,935
Despite his having, he was just telling
me, something of a tricky day at school.

226
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,938
Oh, no, just some of the guys
on the team was giving me crap.

227
00:20:05,963 --> 00:20:09,475
Crap about what?
About the billboards, Mildred.

228
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:12,649
Which is, uh, kind of what I've
come to have a word with you about,

229
00:20:12,674 --> 00:20:14,547
Oh. Proceed.

230
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:17,550
I know how hard it's been for you, Mildred,

231
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:19,618
this past year. We all do.

232
00:20:19,643 --> 00:20:22,922
And if there's ever anything that you need,

233
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:25,558
we'll be there for you. Always.

234
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:31,263
But the town also knows what kind
of a man William Willoughby is.

235
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,501
And the town is dead set against
these billboards of yours.

236
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:37,745
Took a poll, did ya, Father?

237
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:41,007
You know Mildred, If you hadn't
stopped coming to church,

238
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:46,245
you'd had a little bit more understanding
of the depth of people's feelings.

239
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,871
I had more than a dozen people
come up to me on Sunday.

240
00:20:50,242 --> 00:20:52,845
So, yes, I took a poll.

241
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,621
Everybody is with you...

242
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,123
about Angela.

243
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,292
Nobody is with you about this.

244
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:07,867
Y'know what I was thinking about today?

245
00:21:08,353 --> 00:21:10,960
I was thinking 'bout
those street gangs they

246
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:13,649
got in Los Angeles, the
Crips and the Bloods?

247
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:17,133
I was thinking about that
buncha new laws they

248
00:21:17,158 --> 00:21:19,498
came up with, in the
1980's I think it was,

249
00:21:19,523 --> 00:21:23,638
to combat those street-gangs,
those Crips and those Bloods.

250
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,986
And, if I remember rightly, the gist
of what those new laws were saying was

251
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:31,590
if you join one of these gangs,
and you're running with 'em,

252
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,060
and down the block from you one
night, unbeknownst to you,

253
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:40,299
one of your fellow Crips, or your fellow
Bloods, shoot up a place, or stab a guy,

254
00:21:40,324 --> 00:21:44,136
well, even though you didn't
know nothing about it,

255
00:21:44,161 --> 00:21:46,650
even though you may've
just been standing on

256
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:48,998
a streetcorner minding
your own business,

257
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,386
what these new laws said was

258
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:53,846
you are still culpable.

259
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:56,789
You are still culpable, by
the very act of joining

260
00:21:56,814 --> 00:21:59,142
those Crips, or those
Bloods, in the first place.

261
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,887
Which got me thinking, Father,

262
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:06,292
that whole type of situation is kinda
like your Church boys, ain't it?

263
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,663
You've got your colors,
you've got your clubhouse,

264
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,833
you're, for want of a better word, a gang.

265
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,673
And if you're upstairs smoking
a pipe and reading a bible

266
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:22,074
while one of your fellow gang members is
downstairs fucking an altar boy then,

267
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,853
Father, just like the Crips,
and just like the Bloods,

268
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,379
you're culpable.

269
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,815
Cos you joined the gang, man.

270
00:22:30,452 --> 00:22:34,687
And I don't care if you never did shit
or never saw shit or never heard shit.

271
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,488
You joined the gang.

272
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:38,157
You're culpable.

273
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,826
And when a person is culpable

274
00:22:40,851 --> 00:22:43,462
to altar-boy-fucking, or
anykinda-boy-fucking,

275
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,432
I know you guys didn't
really narrow it down,

276
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,718
, then they kinda forfeit the right
to come into my house and say

277
00:22:50,743 --> 00:22:55,107
anything about me, or my life, or
my daughter, or my billboards.

278
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,752
So, why don't you just
finish your tea there,

279
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:02,872
Father, and get the
fuck outta my kitchen.

280
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,392
But thanks for coming up anyway, Father.

281
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,568
How you been feeling, Bill?

282
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:27,473
Oh, like I got cancer in a major organ.

283
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:32,706
Well I just want you to know, we're all on
your side about this Mildred Hayes thing...

284
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:36,548
If I have to hear that one
more fucking time...!

285
00:23:39,102 --> 00:23:42,621
I'm done with this shit. I
can't waste my life waiting.

286
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,367
Stop reading fucking comics and
Get me the file on the Hayes case.

287
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,398
The Angela Hayes case or
the Mildred Hayes case?

288
00:23:52,423 --> 00:23:54,600
There is no Mildred Hayes case.

289
00:23:54,625 --> 00:23:58,137
We've had two official complaints
about the billboards, so, actually...

290
00:23:58,162 --> 00:23:59,429
From who?

291
00:24:00,975 --> 00:24:05,986
A lady with a funny eye...

292
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:07,813
and a fat dentist.

293
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:12,551
Give me the file on the Angela Hayes case.

294
00:24:12,941 --> 00:24:15,721
“A lady with a funny fucking eye”,

295
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,890
Jesus Christ.

296
00:24:31,257 --> 00:24:32,571
Late night?

297
00:24:35,378 --> 00:24:36,378
No.

298
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:38,811
Lay off that Welby guy.

299
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:41,547
Or you'll do what?

300
00:24:42,311 --> 00:24:44,283
Or I'll kick your fucking Momma's teeth in.

301
00:24:44,323 --> 00:24:45,684
No you won't.

302
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,923
Who told ya I was laying on him anyway?
The midget?

303
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,092
What the fuck are you talking about?!

304
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,996
I'm trying to fucking concentrate!
Fucking midgets!

305
00:25:21,949 --> 00:25:23,655
What are you looking for, anyway?

306
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,693
There's nothing to look for.

307
00:25:30,589 --> 00:25:32,197
I don't know what it is.

308
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:35,300
This feels like it's kinda waggling.

309
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:39,645
Well if it's waggling it's gonna
have to come out.

310
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:43,709
Ain't you gonna have a look at it first?

311
00:25:45,444 --> 00:25:47,212
It's gonna have to come out.

312
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:53,886
Uh, can I get a little
Novocaine, there, Doc?

313
00:26:10,705 --> 00:26:12,337
Give it a couple minutes.

314
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:29,704
I just wanted to say...
There's a lotta good friends

315
00:26:29,729 --> 00:26:31,440
of Bill Willoughby in this town, Mrs.
Hayes,

316
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:33,492
No! Ouch! Stop it! No, god!

317
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:38,097
Goddamit.

318
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:47,272
Then why don't you tell those
good friends of Bill Willoughby

319
00:26:47,297 --> 00:26:50,542
to tell him to go do his
fucking job, fat boy.

320
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,458
Hey there, Mildred!

321
00:27:06,864 --> 00:27:09,795
You didn't happen to pay a visit
to the dentist today, did ya?

322
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,750
- No.
- Huh?

323
00:27:11,771 --> 00:27:12,771
I Said 'No'.

324
00:27:13,741 --> 00:27:17,436
Oh. So it wasn't you who drilled
a little hole in one of

325
00:27:17,508 --> 00:27:20,272
big fat Geoffrey's big fat thumbnails, no?

326
00:27:20,861 --> 00:27:22,234
Of course not.

327
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:24,843
- Huh.
- I said “Of course not.”

328
00:27:24,868 --> 00:27:26,812
You drilled a hole in the dentist?

329
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,333
No, Denise, I didn't.

330
00:27:28,358 --> 00:27:31,558
- Well, I thought it was
kinda funny myself, but

331
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:35,787
he wants to press charges, so we're
gonna have to bring you in, I'm afraid.

332
00:27:56,815 --> 00:27:59,411
So how's it all going in the
nigger torturing business, Dixon?

333
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:03,749
It's 'Persons of color'-torturing
business, these days,

334
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,517
if you want to know.

335
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,319
And I didn't torture nobody.

336
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:12,724
What's the matter with you,
saying that goddam stuff on TV.

337
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,793
My momma watches that station!

338
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,036
Your momma does not
know about the torturing?

339
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,996
No she didn't know anything about it.
She's against that kinda thing.

340
00:28:18,021 --> 00:28:19,464
Who's against that kinda thing?

341
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:23,101
Who's against what? My momma. Is
against 'Persons-of-color torturing'.

342
00:28:23,126 --> 00:28:26,838
She said 'nigger-torturing'. I said you
can't say 'nigger-torturing' no more.

343
00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:29,208
You gotta say 'Persons-of-color' torturing.

344
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:32,244
Isn't that right, Chief?

345
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:40,852
I think I'll be able to take care of
Mrs. Hayes on my own from hereon, Jason.

346
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,560
Sure, Chief, I'll be right outside.

347
00:29:00,517 --> 00:29:02,541
Don't gimme that look.

348
00:29:03,175 --> 00:29:07,412
If you got rid of every cop with vaguely
racist leanings then you'd have

349
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:11,006
three cops left and all o'
them are gonna hate the fags

350
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,216
so what are ya gonna do, y'know?

351
00:29:15,836 --> 00:29:17,489
I wanna know something, Mildred...

352
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:20,125
Why'd ya drill a hole thru

353
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:22,356
poor fat Geoffrey's thumbnail?

354
00:29:22,381 --> 00:29:24,381
That didn't happen.

355
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,133
His hand slipped and he
drilled a hole thru his self.

356
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,502
Did he say I did it?

357
00:29:30,735 --> 00:29:33,171
I guess it's just his word
against mine, then huh?

358
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:36,241
Kinda like in all those
rape cases you hear about.

359
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:38,644
Except, this time,

360
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:39,968
the chick ain't losing.

361
00:29:39,993 --> 00:29:42,547
It ain't really about
winning or losing, though,

362
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,749
is it, Mildred?

363
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:48,420
I mean, do you think I care about who
wins or loses between the two of yous?

364
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,756
Do you think I care about dentists?

365
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,891
I don't care about dentists.

366
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,427
Nobody cares about dentists!

367
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:59,398
What I I do care about, or what I'm

368
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:01,767
interested in,

369
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:05,470
is tying you up in court so long

370
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:09,941
that your hours at the gift
shop are so shot to shit

371
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:14,212
that you ain't got a penny to pay
for another months billboards.

372
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:17,646
That's what I'm interested in.

373
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:19,551
I got some dough put away...

374
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,424
What I heard was you had to
sell off your ex-husband's

375
00:30:21,449 --> 00:30:23,438
tractor-trailer to even pay for this
month's billboards, that right?

376
00:30:23,463 --> 00:30:25,975
To even pay for this month's
billboards, that right?

377
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,095
How is ole Charlie, by the way?

378
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:34,889
He still shacked up with that pretty
little intern works down at the zoo?

379
00:30:34,914 --> 00:30:37,669
He's still shacked up with
some chick who smells of shit.

380
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,971
I don't know if the zoo's
got anything to do with it.

381
00:30:39,996 --> 00:30:41,840
Although I'd hope so.

382
00:30:44,476 --> 00:30:46,178
How old is she?

383
00:30:46,203 --> 00:30:48,714
Nineteen? That's smart.

384
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:50,782
Keep trying,

385
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,543
Keep trying.

386
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:55,620
What's Charlie think about these
here billboards of yours,

387
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,663
an ex-cop like Charlie?

388
00:30:57,688 --> 00:31:00,258
Ex-cop, ex-wife-beater.
Same difference, I guess, right?

389
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:02,994
His word against yours, though, right?

390
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,832
Charlie don't know about them, does he?

391
00:31:07,766 --> 00:31:08,878
It's none of his business.

392
00:31:08,903 --> 00:31:10,844
He's kinda paying for
'em though, ain't he?

393
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,903
I'm paying for 'em.

394
00:31:11,928 --> 00:31:14,706
This month you are. How about when...

395
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:22,681
- I didn't mean to...
- I know...

396
00:31:22,963 --> 00:31:25,417
- It was an accident...
- I know, baby.

397
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,419
It's blood.

398
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:31,556
I'll go get somebody...

399
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,626
Hey!

400
00:31:35,706 --> 00:31:38,330
Just let her go.
- C'mon Chief.

401
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:40,065
Just let her go!

402
00:31:44,355 --> 00:31:45,937
Easy, easy, easy.

403
00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:51,209
Hey.

404
00:32:12,872 --> 00:32:14,766
Do birds get cancer?

405
00:32:14,805 --> 00:32:17,803
- Huh?
- Birds. Do they get cancer?

406
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:20,238
I don't know. Dogs do.

407
00:32:20,263 --> 00:32:23,041
Yeah, well, I wasn't
talking about dogs, was I?

408
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:30,621
Great.

409
00:32:30,646 --> 00:32:33,018
The good ole “Raped While
Dying” route home.

410
00:32:33,041 --> 00:32:36,087
Cos if there was two seconds in a
day when I didn't think about her,

411
00:32:36,112 --> 00:32:37,956
and wasn't thinking about how she died, “.

412
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:40,726
There ya go, think about it
some more, why don't ya?”

413
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:43,573
It's good, too, that as
much as a person might've

414
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:45,964
tried to avoid the details
of what happened,

415
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:50,135
cos he didn't think it'd do any good,
and he didn't think he could bear it,

416
00:32:50,328 --> 00:32:54,039
it's also good to be informed in twenty
foot high font and a real nice lettering,

417
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:57,309
the precise details of her last moments.

418
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:00,111
That it wasn't enough that she was raped,

419
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:03,248
and it wasn't enough that she died, no.

420
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,550
“Raped While Dying”.

421
00:33:06,264 --> 00:33:07,786
Thank you, mom.

422
00:33:09,424 --> 00:33:11,530
I gave you the police reports...

423
00:33:11,555 --> 00:33:13,058
I didn't read 'em!

424
00:33:13,922 --> 00:33:16,695
I'm depressed enough as it fucking is!

425
00:33:57,387 --> 00:33:58,703
Mom!

426
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:00,038
Yeah?

427
00:34:00,063 --> 00:34:02,274
You ain't going out again tonight, are ya?

428
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:04,480
Denise and I are gonna grab
a couple of beers, yeah.

429
00:34:04,505 --> 00:34:05,659
Denise gonna be driving ya?

430
00:34:05,684 --> 00:34:08,480
Angela, why don't you just ask
me if you can borrow the car?

431
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,649
- Can I borrow the car?
- No.

432
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:11,750
Bitch!

433
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:14,261
I'll give you money for a taxi

434
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:15,487
if you ask me nice and
don't call me a bitch.

435
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,690
Why did you make me ask you borrow it if
you was never gonna let me borrow it?

436
00:34:17,714 --> 00:34:20,088
Cos it was funny.
And cos you've been smoking pot all day.

437
00:34:20,113 --> 00:34:23,194
- You are such a hypocrite!
- 'Hypocrite, '

438
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:23,939
How?

439
00:34:23,964 --> 00:34:26,121
You drove drunk with us in
the car when we was kids.

440
00:34:26,274 --> 00:34:27,632
What are you talking about?

441
00:34:27,724 --> 00:34:29,134
Daddy told me.

442
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:31,770
- When did you see him?
- don't change the subject.

443
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:35,073
Did you or did you not drive drunk
with us in the car when we was kids?

444
00:34:35,127 --> 00:34:36,447
Once. Maybe.

445
00:34:36,472 --> 00:34:37,201
Oh, 'once, ' okay...

446
00:34:37,226 --> 00:34:39,386
...when he was in the middle
of beating the shit out of me...

447
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:41,163
Which we've only got
your word about, right?

448
00:34:41,188 --> 00:34:42,447
Angela, For Christ's sake...

449
00:34:42,472 --> 00:34:44,291
Oh why are you never on my side, Robbie?

450
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:46,278
I'm always on your side when
you're not being a cunt.

451
00:34:46,303 --> 00:34:47,303
- Hey!
- Hey!

452
00:34:47,328 --> 00:34:49,503
There'll be no more 'Cunts' in
this house, you got that, Mister?

453
00:34:49,528 --> 00:34:50,531
What, are you moving out?

454
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:53,091
It was a gag!

455
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,494
So are ya gonna let me
borrow the car or what?

456
00:34:56,527 --> 00:34:58,229
Why don't you just walk, Angela?

457
00:34:58,255 --> 00:35:00,255
- Why don't you just walk?
- You know what,

458
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,866
I will walk,

459
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,936
I will walk. And y'know what?

460
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:06,315
I hope I get raped on the way.

461
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:08,731
Yeah? Well I hope you
get raped on the way too!

462
00:35:23,272 --> 00:35:25,624
We're gonna need to keep
you in a few days, Bill.

463
00:35:25,752 --> 00:35:27,626
You shouldn't be coughing up blood.

464
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,695
Yeah, I kinda guessed that, Doc.

465
00:35:31,569 --> 00:35:33,231
I'll swing by in the morning. Anne.

466
00:35:33,551 --> 00:35:34,833
Anne.

467
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:41,206
Guess I'll go get your coat, huh?

468
00:35:42,173 --> 00:35:45,711
- Well you know I ain't staying...
- And you know I ain't arguing.

469
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,239
You... old... cunt.

470
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,408
I'm not old, Robbie.

471
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:52,811
That's Dad!

472
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:57,916
Hey dad! How's it going?

473
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,651
Where's the crazy lady...?

474
00:37:06,668 --> 00:37:08,988
The kid's got Rice fucking
Krispies in his fucking hair!

475
00:37:09,013 --> 00:37:10,872
What's going on around here?
And what the fuck's

476
00:37:10,897 --> 00:37:12,731
going on with these fucking
billboards, Mildred?

477
00:37:12,756 --> 00:37:16,334
- Kinda self-explanatory, ain't it?
- Well why don't you just explain it to me?

478
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:19,404
Guess it ain't self-explanatory then.

479
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:22,967
Well, y'know, I guess I
wanted certain people's

480
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:25,300
minds kept on certain
people's jobs, is all.

481
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:29,080
I hadn't heard a word from 'em in seven
goddam months, but I tell ya this,

482
00:37:29,105 --> 00:37:32,016
I heard an awful lot from 'em since
I put those billboards up...

483
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,852
You think this has focused their minds?

484
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:36,939
I'll tell you what it's focused
their minds on. It's focused

485
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:39,258
their minds on how exactly
are they gonna fuck you up.

486
00:37:39,283 --> 00:37:41,359
The more you keep a case in the public eye,

487
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:43,762
the better your chances
of getting it solved,

488
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,717
it's in all the guidebooks, Charlie.

489
00:37:45,869 --> 00:37:47,665
How much those billboards cost?

490
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,477
Bout the same as a tractor-trailer.

491
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,637
- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- Nothing.

492
00:37:52,662 --> 00:37:55,471
Laughed at by a guy with
fucking cereal in his hair!

493
00:37:55,496 --> 00:37:56,808
How is Penelope?

494
00:37:56,958 --> 00:37:59,944
- Huh? She's alright.
- Why don't you invite her in,

495
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,514
- save leaving her sitting out there?
- She's here?

496
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:05,625
- She's out in the car.
- Oh. That explains it.

497
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:10,044
- That explains what?
- I knew I smelled something.

498
00:38:11,997 --> 00:38:13,258
Let her go.

499
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:16,628
Oh, um, I kinda needed to use the bathroom,

500
00:38:16,653 --> 00:38:18,196
but if it's inconvenient, actually

501
00:38:18,221 --> 00:38:19,794
it is inconvenient, isn't
it, I can see it's

502
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:21,366
inconvenient, I can hold
it, it's alright...

503
00:38:21,391 --> 00:38:23,935
- It's the first door, down the hall.
- Are you sure? I feel like I'm

504
00:38:24,332 --> 00:38:26,204
- intruding...
- Just go pee!

505
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:27,605
OK.

506
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,425
Look, you've said what you came to say.

507
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,962
Okay? Why don't ya just go get zoo girl and
get the hell out of my house? Alright?

508
00:38:50,987 --> 00:38:53,167
Um, actually, zoo-wise,

509
00:38:53,192 --> 00:38:55,600
they were letting people go
at the zoo, unfortunately,

510
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:57,969
and it was a case of “Last
in, first out”, so, yeah,

511
00:38:57,994 --> 00:39:00,507
unfortunately the zoo had to let me go.

512
00:39:00,532 --> 00:39:02,539
But they were looking for
people down at the horse-rides

513
00:39:02,564 --> 00:39:04,867
for the disabled's, to look
after the horses down there,

514
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:06,411
so I'm working down there now,

515
00:39:06,436 --> 00:39:08,669
looking after the disabled's horses,

516
00:39:17,548 --> 00:39:18,957
Don't say a word.

517
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:20,892
I wasn't gonna say a word.

518
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,663
You don't think I don't wish
it had never happened?!

519
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,503
You don't think I don't
wish she was still here

520
00:39:32,528 --> 00:39:34,272
I know you do.

521
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:37,342
I know you do.

522
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:42,413
Billboards ain't gonna
bring her back, Mildred.

523
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:46,451
Neither is fucking nineteen
year olds, Charlie.

524
00:39:47,966 --> 00:39:48,966
Yeah.

525
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:51,890
But I know that.

526
00:39:53,584 --> 00:39:54,993
Just go.

527
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,096
Yeah, alright,

528
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,100
I'm such a shitty dad and you're
such a great mom. Alright.

529
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,969
So how come

530
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,453
a week before she died
she comes around asking

531
00:40:07,478 --> 00:40:09,340
if she can move in
with me at my place,

532
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,845
cos she couldn't stand the two of
yous bitching at each other no more,

533
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,745
- and fighting with each other no more..
- I don't believe you...

534
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:16,180
And I said “No, stay at
home, your mom loves you.”

535
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,417
And now I wish I hadn't,

536
00:40:20,371 --> 00:40:22,198
cos if I hadn't she'd
still fucking be here!

537
00:40:22,223 --> 00:40:24,722
- I don't believe you!
- Don't believe me.

538
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,492
Ask Fruit Loop boy.

539
00:40:38,303 --> 00:40:39,404
Is it true?

540
00:40:41,258 --> 00:40:42,740
I don't know, mom.

541
00:40:46,007 --> 00:40:47,478
Yeah, you do.

542
00:40:57,647 --> 00:40:59,324
Oh come on

543
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:03,294
Donald Sutherland again! What is this,
a freaking Donald Sutherland season?!

544
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:04,629
I like him.

545
00:41:04,654 --> 00:41:06,654
I like his hair.
- Hair.

546
00:41:08,188 --> 00:41:10,568
This is the one where his little girl dies.

547
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,271
Always a plus in a movie!

548
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,651
Talking of dead kids,

549
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:17,942
what's happening with the Billboard lady?

550
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,445
Oh that cooze won't listen to reason.

551
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,863
She's as tough as an old boot!

552
00:41:24,449 --> 00:41:27,318
Oh. Why don't you just fuck her
over thru her friends then?

553
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,688
- Huh.
- Y'know,

554
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:34,125
why don't you fuck her friends over?
Bring her around out way.

555
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:37,462
Has she got some friends
you could fuck over?

556
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,377
Bastard.

557
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:03,654
Hey fuckhead?!

558
00:42:04,155 --> 00:42:06,491
- What?
- Don't say 'What', Dixon,

559
00:42:06,516 --> 00:42:09,225
when she comes in calling you a
fuckhead, and don't you come in here...

560
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:10,152
- Shut up!

561
00:42:10,438 --> 00:42:13,587
- You! Get over here.
- No.

562
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:16,000
You get over here.

563
00:42:16,025 --> 00:42:18,803
- Alright...
- What?! Don't... Dixon!

564
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,903
What?! I'm taking care of this!

565
00:42:19,928 --> 00:42:22,840
- You do not allow a member of the public to
call you a fuckhead in the station house!

566
00:42:22,865 --> 00:42:26,210
That's what I'm doing, I'm taking
care of it! In my own way. Actually.

567
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,613
Now get out of my ass! Mrs. Hayes.

568
00:42:28,634 --> 00:42:30,748
Grab a seat.
What is it I can do for you today?

569
00:42:30,773 --> 00:42:32,016
Where's Denise Watson?

570
00:42:32,041 --> 00:42:34,619
- Denise Watson's in the Clank.
- On what charge?

571
00:42:34,644 --> 00:42:36,721
- Possession.
- Of what?

572
00:42:36,746 --> 00:42:39,724
Two marijuana cigarettes. Big ones.

573
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:43,428
- When's the bail hearing?
- I asked the Judge not to give her bail

574
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:47,848
on account of her previous marijuana
violations and the Judge said sure.

575
00:42:47,873 --> 00:42:49,167
You fucking prick.

576
00:42:53,094 --> 00:42:55,006
You do not call an officer of the law

577
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,909
a fucking prick in his own
station-house, Mrs. Hayes.

578
00:42:58,142 --> 00:42:59,944
Or anywhere, actually.

579
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:03,381
What's with the new
hard-boiled attitude, Dixon?

580
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:05,750
Your momma been coaching ya?

581
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:11,017
No. My momma doesn't do that.

582
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:15,660
Take 'em down,

583
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,295
you hear me?

584
00:43:18,482 --> 00:43:20,131
You did good, Dixon.

585
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:21,899
Yeah, I know I did.

586
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:30,446
Now, the rules here are twofold;

587
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:31,442
no kid

588
00:43:31,495 --> 00:43:36,000
can leave this goddam
blanket at any goddam time,

589
00:43:36,025 --> 00:43:40,718
and every single one of these
dolls and these teddy bears

590
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,229
has gotta be hooked up.

591
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:44,922
Now, your momma and I,

592
00:43:44,947 --> 00:43:50,303
although it won't look like it, we'll
be watching every goddam move you make

593
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:53,406
and the most important thing
while we're watching you

594
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:57,944
is you do not leave this blanket.

595
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,247
The next most important thing is you do not

596
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:03,116
at any stage

597
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:08,882
allow the fishing rods to stick
into you or your sister's eyeballs,

598
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:14,118
as this would be counter-productive
to the entire operation.

599
00:44:14,138 --> 00:44:15,760
What would this be?

600
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:20,625
Counterproductive
to the entire operation.

601
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:21,759
Then troops...

602
00:44:25,594 --> 00:44:26,931
start fishing.

603
00:44:30,101 --> 00:44:31,927
We. Are. Not.

604
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,437
We are.

605
00:45:17,582 --> 00:45:19,517
Hey, baby.

606
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:24,889
Yeah!

607
00:45:25,623 --> 00:45:27,091
Still no arrests.

608
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,495
How come, I wonder?

609
00:45:32,697 --> 00:45:34,677
Cos there ain't no God
and the world's empty

610
00:45:34,702 --> 00:45:36,725
and it don't matter what
we do to each other?

611
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:41,138
Ooh, I hope not.

612
00:45:47,178 --> 00:45:50,715
How comes you came up here outta
nowhere, looking so pretty?

613
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:55,920
You ain't trying to make me believe in
reincarnation or something, are ya?

614
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,023
Well, you're pretty, but you ain't her.

615
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,702
She got killed,

616
00:46:02,727 --> 00:46:04,695
and now she's dead forever.

617
00:46:07,665 --> 00:46:09,367
I do thank you for coming up, though.

618
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,879
If I had some food I'd give it ya,

619
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:17,408
but I've only got some Doritos and It
might kill ya, they're kinda pointy.

620
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,311
Then where would we be?

621
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:32,390
Oh, Mildred.

622
00:46:36,303 --> 00:46:37,628
Yeah, so I

623
00:46:37,653 --> 00:46:42,660
uh, just happened to be looking
over our contract we drew up

624
00:46:42,685 --> 00:46:45,778
back that time, and what I realized was,

625
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:49,047
I realized that although
payment is to be made

626
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:50,608
on the first day of each month,

627
00:46:50,633 --> 00:46:54,520
the first payment you paid
was actually a deposit,

628
00:46:54,545 --> 00:46:59,271
wasn't it, like we said, so actually,
in point of fact, you're actually

629
00:46:59,296 --> 00:47:01,333
behind in your payments now, by,

630
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:02,953
yeah, a month.

631
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,622
Yeah. That's, uh,

632
00:47:05,397 --> 00:47:08,483
what the contract says.
Looking it over an' all.

633
00:47:09,427 --> 00:47:11,227
The lawyer says so too.

634
00:47:12,129 --> 00:47:14,265
When do you need this next payment by, Red?

635
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,486
Uh, well, now, really.

636
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:26,077
Or... Fuh uh... Friday?

637
00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:27,012
Wow.

638
00:47:28,085 --> 00:47:30,545
When you can't trust the lawyers
and the advertising men,

639
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:33,025
what the hell's America coming to, huh?

640
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:34,927
Who got to ya Red?

641
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:36,220
Willoughby?

642
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:39,657
- Nobody got to me.
- My fat fucking ass!

643
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:43,527
He's dying, Mildred.

644
00:47:43,546 --> 00:47:45,363
We're all fucking dying!

645
00:47:46,018 --> 00:47:46,699
Red?

646
00:47:46,724 --> 00:47:48,741
Oh, hi Pamela! Um, we're a
little bit busy, at the moment,

647
00:47:48,766 --> 00:47:49,843
Pam, if that's okay...

648
00:47:49,868 --> 00:47:51,422
Oh Red, I know, and I know
you were real anxious

649
00:47:51,447 --> 00:47:53,072
about talking to Mrs. Hayes
this morning and all...

650
00:47:53,097 --> 00:47:54,247
Anxious? No.

651
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:56,941
But that's the thing, there's no need
to be, cos you won't believe it!

652
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:59,744
A little Mexican delivery boy
just dropped in with this...

653
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:01,622
What the hell's this?!

654
00:48:01,647 --> 00:48:05,086
- I know! It's five thousand dollars!
And guess what

655
00:48:05,111 --> 00:48:08,786
the note says? It says it's to pay for
the rental on Mrs. Hayes's billboards!

656
00:48:08,811 --> 00:48:11,155
Can you believe it? That's why I butted in!

657
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,500
- Well, who's it from?
- Well, it doesn't say.

658
00:48:13,716 --> 00:48:15,259
Well, where's the delivery boy?

659
00:48:15,366 --> 00:48:15,990
Well, he went.

660
00:48:16,015 --> 00:48:17,886
- Well, did you see what
company he was from?

661
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:21,499
- Well, no.
- Well, what kinda uniform did he have on?

662
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,969
Well, he just looked like one of
those fat little Mexican boys.

663
00:48:25,936 --> 00:48:27,171
On a bicycle?

664
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,977
Did I do something wrong?
- No, Pam, you did good.

665
00:48:33,002 --> 00:48:35,112
Yeah, Pam, you did real good.

666
00:48:35,137 --> 00:48:37,314
Did I? Great!

667
00:48:38,086 --> 00:48:40,086
Ain't life crazy?

668
00:48:44,915 --> 00:48:46,223
What's the note say Red?

669
00:48:48,726 --> 00:48:50,561
Says, er,

670
00:48:50,586 --> 00:48:54,131
“This here money is to go towards the
fund for Mildred Hayes's billboards,

671
00:48:54,156 --> 00:48:57,334
cos she ain't the only one
round here who hates the pigs.

672
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:58,636
Signed, a friend.”

673
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:01,705
Jeez, I guess ya can't be picky who
your friends are these days, huh?

674
00:49:04,552 --> 00:49:08,421
Um, I guess I'll be needing
a receipt off ya Red,

675
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:11,182
y'know, saying the price of next
month's is paid in full an' all.

676
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,384
Oh. Sure, Mildred, sure.

677
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:15,577
Yeah. Like, now.

678
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:17,071
Oh! Sure!

679
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,760
Is mommy drunk, daddy?

680
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:25,823
No, no, she's just got a
little migraine, that's all.

681
00:49:25,848 --> 00:49:27,939
A little Chardonnay migraine,

682
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:31,001
now no more chit chat out of you two, ok?

683
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:34,405
Can we stay home from school
again tomorrow, daddy?

684
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:37,508
We'll see what your mommy says
in the morning, darling...

685
00:49:37,585 --> 00:49:38,732
Aww!

686
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,911
Eyes close.

687
00:49:42,092 --> 00:49:44,807
Then go to sleep, ok?

688
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,396
You don't smell of puke.

689
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,065
Which is good.

690
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:03,421
Aquafresh. Trick I learned.

691
00:50:03,446 --> 00:50:05,515
Women, huh?

692
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:11,775
It's still your turn to clean the
horseshit outta the stable, y'know?

693
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,800
Those fucking horses!

694
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:17,948
They're your fucking horses! I'm gonna
have those fucking horses shot!

695
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:20,351
I'll do it,

696
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:22,620
you lazy bitch.

697
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:24,688
Thank you, poppa.

698
00:50:27,658 --> 00:50:29,226
That was a real nice day.

699
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:33,330
And that was a real nice fuck.

700
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,303
You got a real nice cock, Mr. Willoughby.

701
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:45,676
Is that from a play,

702
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,946
“You got a real nice cock, Mr. Willoughby?”
I think.

703
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:51,782
I heard it in a Shakespeare one time.

704
00:50:51,822 --> 00:50:53,150
You dummy.

705
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:55,719
It's Oscar Wilde.

706
00:51:51,175 --> 00:51:52,710
"Oscar Wilde."

707
00:52:21,431 --> 00:52:23,515
My darling Anne.

708
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,743
There's a longer letter
in the dresser drawer

709
00:52:25,768 --> 00:52:27,987
I've been writing for the last week or so.

710
00:52:28,012 --> 00:52:29,855
That one covers us,

711
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,690
and my memories of us,

712
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:34,159
and how much I've always loved you.

713
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:36,131
This one just covers tonight,

714
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:38,156
and, more importantly, today.

715
00:52:39,132 --> 00:52:42,034
Tonight I have gone out
to the horses to end it.

716
00:52:42,059 --> 00:52:44,862
I cannot say sorry for the act itself,

717
00:52:44,887 --> 00:52:48,507
although I know that for a short
time you will be angry at me

718
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:50,134
or even hate me for it.

719
00:52:50,548 --> 00:52:51,977
Please don't.

720
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,772
This is not a case of
“I came in this world alone,

721
00:52:54,797 --> 00:52:58,617
and I'm going out of it alone”
or anything dumb like that.

722
00:52:58,642 --> 00:53:02,588
I did not come in this world
alone, my mom was there,

723
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:05,257
and I am not going out of it alone,

724
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:06,555
cos you are there,

725
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:08,253
drunk on the couch,

726
00:53:08,278 --> 00:53:10,487
making Oscar Wilde cock jokes.

727
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:14,558
No. This is a case,
in some senses, of bravery.

728
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:17,461
Not the bravery of facing a bullet down;

729
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:20,273
the next few months of
pain would be far harder

730
00:53:20,298 --> 00:53:21,932
than that small flash.

731
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,768
No, it's the bravery of weighing up

732
00:53:24,793 --> 00:53:27,738
the next few months of
still being with you,

733
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,840
still waking up with you,

734
00:53:29,865 --> 00:53:32,117
of playing with the kids,

735
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,812
against the next few months
of seeing in your eyes

736
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:37,489
how much my pain is killing you;

737
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:40,350
how my weakened body as it ebbs away

738
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:44,855
and you tend to it are your final
and lasting memories of me.

739
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:47,157
I won't have that.

740
00:53:48,324 --> 00:53:51,628
Your final memories of me
will be us at the riverside,

741
00:53:51,653 --> 00:53:53,374
and that dumb fishing game

742
00:53:53,407 --> 00:53:55,374
which I think they cheated at,

743
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:59,078
and me inside of you, and you on top of me,

744
00:53:59,103 --> 00:54:01,238
and barely a fleeting thought

745
00:54:01,263 --> 00:54:03,596
of the darkness yet to come.

746
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,118
That was the best, Anne.

747
00:54:06,143 --> 00:54:08,791
A whole day of not thinking about it.

748
00:54:09,379 --> 00:54:13,592
Dwell on this day, baby,
cos it was the best day of my life.

749
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:15,919
Kiss the girls for me,

750
00:54:15,944 --> 00:54:17,921
and know that I've always loved you,

751
00:54:17,942 --> 00:54:20,724
and maybe I'll see you again
if there's another place.

752
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:22,367
And if there ain't,

753
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,628
well, it's been Heaven knowing you.

754
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:28,265
Your boy...

755
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:31,168
...Bill.

756
00:55:27,090 --> 00:55:29,259
What the Hell's going on around here?

757
00:55:33,366 --> 00:55:34,366
What?

758
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:04,094
Can you stand now?

759
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,930
I can stand

760
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:12,069
I'd better get out there,

761
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:14,805
say something to 'em.

762
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,708
You ain't gonna faint again, are ya?

763
00:56:45,762 --> 00:56:48,906
I know... that the best thing,

764
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:51,308
the only thing,

765
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:53,652
to honor that man's memory right now,

766
00:56:53,677 --> 00:56:55,712
is to go to work.

767
00:56:55,737 --> 00:56:57,247
Is to be a

768
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:59,383
good cop.

769
00:57:00,651 --> 00:57:02,519
Is to walk in his shoes.

770
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,289
Is to do what he did,
every day of his life.

771
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:07,858
Help people.

772
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:41,325
What the hell is going on?

773
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:00,143
Where are you going?

774
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:08,318
You fucking pig!

775
00:58:08,438 --> 00:58:09,987
What the fuck are you doing?!

776
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:11,755
Shut up!

777
00:58:32,659 --> 00:58:33,910
See, Red?

778
00:58:34,144 --> 00:58:36,346
I got issues with white folks too...

779
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,554
The fuck are you looking at?

780
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,237
Reports, sadly, have come in overnight,

781
00:59:00,262 --> 00:59:03,306
that Chief William Willoughby
of Ebbing, Missouri,

782
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:06,576
took his own life early this morning
in the grounds of his home.

783
00:59:06,777 --> 00:59:09,546
This report just in from
Gabriella Forrester.

784
00:59:09,571 --> 00:59:13,150
Tragedy came calling today
upon this quiet family home

785
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:14,851
outside of Ebbing, Missouri;

786
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,120
a home belonging to Chief
William Willoughby,

787
00:59:17,145 --> 00:59:20,824
his wife, Anne, their two
young daughters, Polly and Jane.

788
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:23,641
What appears to be a
self-inflicted gunshot wound

789
00:59:23,666 --> 00:59:26,020
brought life to an end
for Chief Willoughby,

790
00:59:26,222 --> 00:59:28,398
a man highly respected in Ebbing

791
00:59:28,423 --> 00:59:31,257
for his diligence and his
service to the community,

792
00:59:31,275 --> 00:59:34,404
What led him to take his life in
the early hours of this morning

793
00:59:34,429 --> 00:59:36,429
it is too early to speculate;

794
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,275
there were rumors of illness;

795
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,685
could it simply have been
the pressure of the job;

796
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:45,997
or could it have something to do with a
story we ran here just two weeks ago,

797
00:59:46,022 --> 00:59:49,394
of these billboards,
and the woman who put them there,

798
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,487
...Mildred Hayes.

799
01:00:01,536 --> 01:00:03,133
Don't. Don't.

800
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:12,641
Hey there.

801
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:15,178
Do you know who threw that can?

802
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:16,378
What can?

803
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:21,483
How about you, sweetheart?
Do you know who threw that can?

804
01:00:21,508 --> 01:00:23,052
 Uh, no, I didn't really see...

805
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:34,036
Thank you mom.

806
01:00:45,527 --> 01:00:48,111
And what can I do for you today, Sir?

807
01:00:48,217 --> 01:00:49,613
What's your name?

808
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:53,517
Name's on my tag, man.

809
01:00:53,542 --> 01:00:55,093
You hard of reading?

810
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:56,486
Hard of reading

811
01:00:56,511 --> 01:01:00,098
no, no. That's good, “hard of reading”.
It's kind of like “hard of hearing”,

812
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:02,634
but it's actually it's “hard of reading',

813
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,705
it's like a play on words or something huh.

814
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:07,097
What do you want?

815
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:10,242
Uh, I've been sent down
to uh, take over from.

816
01:01:10,267 --> 01:01:12,769
Chief Willoughby, in light of
last night's unfortunate event.

817
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:15,839
You have got to be fucking kidding me!

818
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:21,011
Do you have any documentation
to prove that, Sir?

819
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:24,514
You really wanna see my
documentation, fucker?

820
01:01:24,539 --> 01:01:26,883
Yeah, see his documentation!

821
01:01:27,043 --> 01:01:28,511
Should make him show it to you.

822
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:33,420
None of you cracker motherfuckers
got no work to do?

823
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:38,261
Ain't that racialist?

824
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:45,535
What happened to your hands, Officer Dixon?

825
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:48,113
Oh, I just kinda

826
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:50,416
banged 'em up a little
bit while I was throwing

827
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:52,409
some guy out of a fucking window.
Y'know,

828
01:01:52,434 --> 01:01:54,744
the usual.
- Oh yeah?

829
01:01:55,011 --> 01:01:57,480
They never taught me
that one at the Academy.

830
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,816
Which fucking Academy you go to?

831
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:04,788
How's things coming along
on the Angela Hayes case?

832
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:08,291
How's things coming along on the 'Mind
your own fucking business' case?

833
01:02:08,316 --> 01:02:11,895
How things coming along on the
hand me your gun and your badge?

834
01:02:15,532 --> 01:02:19,536
- Huh?
- Hand me your gun and your badge.

835
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:40,190
Shit.

836
01:03:03,069 --> 01:03:05,548
I can't find my badge.

837
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,751
No, seriously. Maybe I lost it

838
01:03:07,776 --> 01:03:10,455
or dropped it when I was
doing the window guy?

839
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,515
Just get out of my station house, man.

840
01:03:37,963 --> 01:03:39,215
What's going on?

841
01:03:42,626 --> 01:03:45,230
I think I just got fired.

842
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:47,757
Fired or suspended, I'm not sure which...

843
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:48,972
Fired.

844
01:04:19,579 --> 01:04:22,045
Anything I can help you
with, just gimme a holler.

845
01:04:25,172 --> 01:04:28,064
Give Mildred Hayes

846
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:30,232
a holler.

847
01:04:32,692 --> 01:04:33,803
Okay.

848
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:36,538
You know me?

849
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:38,541
Only from the TV,

850
01:04:38,808 --> 01:04:39,976
and the radio.

851
01:04:48,144 --> 01:04:51,020
How much these here 'Welcome
to Missouri' rabbits go for?

852
01:04:51,588 --> 01:04:52,588
Seven bucks.

853
01:04:53,162 --> 01:04:54,642
It's writ right on 'em.

854
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:04,134
Guess he ain't seven bucks now.

855
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:08,037
Why'd you coming here for?

856
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:09,706
What did I come in here for?

857
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:13,633
Well, maybe I'm a good friend of
Willoughby's, how about that?

858
01:05:14,177 --> 01:05:15,245
Are you?

859
01:05:15,979 --> 01:05:16,979
Or, y'know...

860
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:21,918
maybe I was a friend of your
daughter's or something.

861
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:24,219
How about that?

862
01:05:27,123 --> 01:05:28,291
Were you?

863
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:32,462
Or, uh,

864
01:05:35,165 --> 01:05:38,184
y'know, maybe I was the guy who
fucked her while she was dying?

865
01:05:38,902 --> 01:05:40,203
How about that?

866
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:44,306
Were you?

867
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:47,830
No.

868
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:50,947
I would've liked to.

869
01:05:52,382 --> 01:05:54,751
I saw her picture in the paper there.

870
01:05:57,954 --> 01:05:59,840
Saved by the bell, huh?

871
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,259
You owe me seven fucking
dollars for the rabbit.

872
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:07,555
Guess you'll have to get it off me next
time I'm passing through, huh Mildred?

873
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:08,555
I guess I will.

874
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:20,877
You don't know how glad I am to see you.

875
01:06:21,411 --> 01:06:23,713
- What?!
- That guy was trying to scare me.

876
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,949
I wouldn't have said you scare easy.

877
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:27,784
I ain't the worst.

878
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,120
What can I do for you, ma'am?

879
01:06:31,433 --> 01:06:35,266
My husband left this for you before he
shot himself in the head last night.

880
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:41,598
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Willoughby...
- Are you?

881
01:06:42,899 --> 01:06:44,266
Are you really?

882
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:45,105
Sure I am.

883
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:47,545
Surely it's the perfect
ending for you, isn't it?

884
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:48,771
It's proof

885
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:50,941
that they've been successful,
these billboards

886
01:06:50,966 --> 01:06:52,675
of yours, isn't it,
a dead policeman?

887
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,344
It's quantifiable now.

888
01:06:54,369 --> 01:06:56,369
- Are you blaming this on me?
- no

889
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:00,216
I'm not blaming this on you. I
just came to give you the letter.

890
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:03,801
Now, my two little girls
are out in the car,

891
01:07:03,826 --> 01:07:06,173
so I'd better not stay and chat.

892
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:10,730
I'm not quite sure what we're going
to do for the rest of the day.

893
01:07:11,995 --> 01:07:14,339
It's hard to know what to do

894
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:17,066
the day your husband kills himself.

895
01:07:17,091 --> 01:07:19,091
It's hard to know what to do.

896
01:07:48,703 --> 01:07:50,571
Dear Mildred,

897
01:07:50,596 --> 01:07:52,644
Dead Man Willoughby here.

898
01:07:52,669 --> 01:07:55,238
Firstly I wanted to apologize for dying

899
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:57,815
without catching your daughter's killer.

900
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:00,223
It's a source of great
pain to me, and it would

901
01:08:00,248 --> 01:08:02,754
break my heart to think you
thought I didn't care,

902
01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:05,056
cos I did care.

903
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:07,091
There are just some cases...

904
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:09,394
...where you never catch a break,

905
01:08:09,419 --> 01:08:11,430
then five years down the line

906
01:08:11,461 --> 01:08:15,425
some guy hears some other guy
bragging about it in a bar-room

907
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:17,201
or a jail-cell

908
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:20,738
and the whole thing is wrapped
up thru sheer stupidity.

909
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:23,880
I hope that might be true
for Angela, I really do.

910
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:25,743
Second,

911
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:30,515
I gotta admit, Mildred, the
billboards were a great fucking idea.

912
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:32,617
They were like a chess move.

913
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:36,454
And although they had absolutely
nothing to do with my dying,

914
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:40,191
I'm sure that everyone in town
will assume that they did,

915
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,619
which is why, for
Willoughby's counter-move,

916
01:08:42,644 --> 01:08:45,597
I decided to pay the next
month's rent on 'em.

917
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:47,398
I thought it'd be funny,

918
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:51,961
you having to defend 'em a whole 'nother
month after they've stuck me in the ground.

919
01:08:52,575 --> 01:08:54,930
The joke is on you, Mildred, ha ha,

920
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:57,500
and I hope they do not kill you.

921
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:02,604
So good luck with all that, and
good luck with everything else too.

922
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:06,142
I hope and I pray that you get him.

923
01:09:23,593 --> 01:09:26,919
Well, do you want me to
go down and talk to them?

924
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:30,608
No I don't want you to go
down and talk to them.

925
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:33,903
Somebody sending their goddam mother
down to talk to the goddam police.

926
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:39,113
And say what?

927
01:09:39,138 --> 01:09:41,831
And say to give you your job back.

928
01:09:41,856 --> 01:09:44,100
And to get rid of the black guy.

929
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:46,928
They ain't gonna listen
to some guy's mother,

930
01:09:46,953 --> 01:09:48,608
asking them to get rid
of some black guy.

931
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,654
Things have moved on in The South!

932
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:53,056
Well it shouldn't've!

933
01:09:55,058 --> 01:09:59,228
Will they give you some money
for being laid off an' all?

934
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:03,246
I don't know what the
compensation scheme is

935
01:10:03,271 --> 01:10:05,595
for when you throw a guy
out of a window, Mom.

936
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:08,456
I guess I shoulda looked into that
beforehand. Let me Google that!

937
01:10:09,544 --> 01:10:11,607
A couple grand, maybe?

938
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:14,218
You've been there three years.

939
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:17,880
Not counting the five years at the Academy.

940
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:20,291
Six!

941
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:22,819
If you count the year you were held back.

942
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,691
- Where ya going?
- None of your business.

943
01:10:29,459 --> 01:10:31,769
Off to see your fancy woman?

944
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:35,698
- I don't got a fancy woman.
- Yeah. I know!

945
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:40,703
- Hey, You wanna watch yourself.
- Or you'll do what?

946
01:10:44,124 --> 01:10:46,576
I'm blowin' your goddam head off.

947
01:10:57,373 --> 01:10:59,622
- Oh, did you hear the news?
- What news?

948
01:10:59,647 --> 01:11:02,692
That Dixon guy threw that Welby
guy out his window this morning.

949
01:11:03,639 --> 01:11:05,280
You're shitting me.

950
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:12,101
Is he okay?

951
01:11:18,228 --> 01:11:20,151
You're shitting me!

952
01:11:20,176 --> 01:11:21,994
Woah! Shit!

953
01:11:22,019 --> 01:11:23,421
Holy Shit!

954
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:24,981
Holy Shit!

955
01:11:26,367 --> 01:11:27,667
Fuck!

956
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,021
Go get the other one from the house!

957
01:11:32,046 --> 01:11:33,856
Shouldn't I call the fire department?

958
01:11:33,881 --> 01:11:36,325
Fuck the fire department!
They probably started it!

959
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:38,350
Well don't do anything stupid!

960
01:11:39,454 --> 01:11:42,941
Scumbags, scumbags, scumbags.
Fucking scumbags.

961
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:17,975
Shit!

962
01:12:18,020 --> 01:12:19,306
Alright.

963
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:42,758
Are you kidding me?

964
01:12:47,859 --> 01:12:50,285
Mom, What the hell are you doing?

965
01:12:57,807 --> 01:12:59,529
Okay, Alright. Come on...

966
01:12:59,554 --> 01:13:02,311
Leave it, Ma. Please It's too late.

967
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:07,654
- Robbie.
- Mom, leave it, please!

968
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,409
Robbie!

969
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:39,482
How are those hands?

970
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:44,153
Give us a minute.

971
01:13:47,223 --> 01:13:49,066
Can I ask you a couple questions?

972
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:52,428
You can ask me all the questions you
want if you take me down and arrest me.

973
01:13:53,029 --> 01:13:55,932
I'm not gonna arrest you, Mrs. Hayes.
I got nothing to arrest you for.

974
01:13:58,334 --> 01:13:59,936
Not yet you ain't.

975
01:14:06,075 --> 01:14:08,177
We ain't all the enemy, y'know?

976
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:29,498
I'll crucify the motherfuckers.

977
01:14:41,077 --> 01:14:43,020
What are you gonna do to 'em, Mildred?

978
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:44,956
You're gonna crucify 'em, you say?

979
01:14:44,981 --> 01:14:47,116
Yeah, I'm gonna crucify 'em.

980
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,894
Who you gonna crucify?

981
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:51,554
The motherfuckers?

982
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:53,555
Yeah!

983
01:14:53,723 --> 01:14:56,158
I'm gonna crucify the motherfuckers.

984
01:14:57,044 --> 01:15:00,470
Well, then those motherfuckers
better watch out then,

985
01:15:00,495 --> 01:15:01,495
huh?

986
01:15:05,568 --> 01:15:06,769
Fucking A!

987
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:12,308
What's this shit...?

988
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:16,145
...and as sad as the spectacle of
these burned out billboards might be,

989
01:15:16,170 --> 01:15:18,255
in light of the death of Chief Willoughby,

990
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,217
this reporter for one can't help but
wonder whether this finally puts an end

991
01:15:21,242 --> 01:15:23,786
to the strange saga of the three
billboards outside of Eb...

992
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:26,222
This don't put an end to
shit, you fucking retard,

993
01:15:26,247 --> 01:15:27,556
this is just the fucking start,

994
01:15:27,581 --> 01:15:31,644
so why don't you put that on your “Good Morning
Missouri fucking Wake-Up Broadcast”, bitch!

995
01:15:41,611 --> 01:15:46,175
I see on the TV there was a buncha
fires lit outside o' town last night.

996
01:15:47,977 --> 01:15:49,445
Buncha fires, huh?

997
01:15:50,446 --> 01:15:52,481
Out at those billboards.

998
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:58,180
Yeah, well, back when I was a cop I woulda
been interested in who set those fires

999
01:15:58,205 --> 01:16:00,041
cos, technically, that's arson,

1000
01:16:00,066 --> 01:16:02,379
but as I am no longer
employed by those people

1001
01:16:02,404 --> 01:16:04,716
I don't really give a
good god damn, now do I?

1002
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,585
The Dixon residence.

1003
01:16:15,610 --> 01:16:17,334
Hey Dixon.

1004
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:19,216
Hey, Sarge.

1005
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,911
- You got any news?
- News about what?

1006
01:16:21,936 --> 01:16:23,179
I dunno,

1007
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:26,749
about my job and stuff?

1008
01:16:27,937 --> 01:16:29,906
No, no. What?

1009
01:16:30,228 --> 01:16:31,529
No.

1010
01:16:31,554 --> 01:16:34,757
Anne Willoughby just dropped in a letter

1011
01:16:34,782 --> 01:16:36,692
that Bill wrote you before he died.

1012
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,169
Oh my God! What's it say?

1013
01:16:38,194 --> 01:16:40,795
I haven't read it, Dixon, it's not my
letter.

1014
01:16:41,062 --> 01:16:43,307
Oh. Listen, I'll come right down...

1015
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:45,201
I'll be there in like 15 minutes.

1016
01:16:47,361 --> 01:16:50,674
Well, uh... I don't think
that'd be such a great idea,

1017
01:16:50,699 --> 01:16:52,650
as things stand, Jason.

1018
01:16:52,675 --> 01:16:57,046
Uh, you've still got your keys to
the station-house though, right?

1019
01:16:57,199 --> 01:16:58,230
Yeah.

1020
01:16:58,255 --> 01:17:01,347
Well, why don't you just come pick
it up when everyone's gone home.

1021
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:03,919
I can leave it on your desk for ya.

1022
01:17:05,521 --> 01:17:06,521
Oh. Okay.

1023
01:17:06,956 --> 01:17:09,266
Actually, yeah,

1024
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,815
then when you're done you can

1025
01:17:11,840 --> 01:17:14,672
just leave the keys,

1026
01:17:14,697 --> 01:17:16,565
save us picking 'em up later.

1027
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:20,769
Alright.

1028
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:50,795
Jason, Willoughby here.

1029
01:17:50,820 --> 01:17:53,310
I'm dead now, sorry about that,

1030
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,314
but there's something I
wanted to say to you

1031
01:17:55,339 --> 01:17:57,230
that I never really
said when I was alive.

1032
01:17:58,974 --> 01:18:03,312
I think you've got the makings of
being a really good cop, Jason,

1033
01:18:03,337 --> 01:18:06,257
and you know why?

1034
01:18:06,282 --> 01:18:08,231
Because, deep down,

1035
01:18:08,284 --> 01:18:10,294
you're a decent man.

1036
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:14,156
I know you don't think I think
that, but I do, Dipshit.

1037
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:23,699
I do think you're too angry, though,..

1038
01:18:26,103 --> 01:18:28,527
And I know it's all
since your dad died and

1039
01:18:28,552 --> 01:18:31,030
you had to go look after
your Mom and all...

1040
01:18:33,943 --> 01:18:36,987
But as long as you hold onto so much hate

1041
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:39,990
then I don't think you're
ever going to become...

1042
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:42,184
What I know you wanna become...

1043
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:46,355
A Detective.

1044
01:18:52,261 --> 01:18:54,930
Cos you know what you need
to become a detective.

1045
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:59,134
And I know you're gonna
wince when I say this...

1046
01:19:00,823 --> 01:19:04,156
But what you need to become a detective...

1047
01:19:04,733 --> 01:19:06,001
is Love.

1048
01:19:07,376 --> 01:19:08,677
Fuck 'em!

1049
01:19:15,497 --> 01:19:18,265
Because thru Love comes Calm,

1050
01:19:18,290 --> 01:19:20,798
and thru Calm comes Thought.

1051
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:24,360
And you need
Thought to detect stuff sometimes, Jason.

1052
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:31,965
It's kinda all you need.

1053
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:33,736
You don't even need a gun.

1054
01:19:33,761 --> 01:19:35,738
And you definitely don't need Hate.

1055
01:19:36,405 --> 01:19:39,041
Hate never solved nothing...

1056
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:44,921
But Calm did.

1057
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:47,057
And Thought did. Try it.

1058
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:50,133
Try it just for a change.

1059
01:19:50,158 --> 01:19:51,754
No-one'll think you're gay.

1060
01:19:52,438 --> 01:19:54,939
And if they do, arrest 'em for homophobia!

1061
01:19:55,057 --> 01:19:56,592
Won't they be surprised!

1062
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:59,690
Good luck to you, Jason.

1063
01:19:59,715 --> 01:20:01,184
You're a decent man,

1064
01:20:01,209 --> 01:20:03,632
and yeah you've had a run of bad luck...

1065
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:07,444
But things are gonna change for you...

1066
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:08,860
I can feel it.

1067
01:20:38,534 --> 01:20:39,835
Calm.

1068
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:42,003
Calm.

1069
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:44,539
Calm.

1070
01:22:05,554 --> 01:22:06,755
So what did you see?

1071
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:09,305
Well when we turned the corner from Spring,

1072
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:11,176
the fire was already raging,

1073
01:22:11,201 --> 01:22:12,627
and then

1074
01:22:12,652 --> 01:22:15,068
two seconds later the cop guy
just jumps out the window...

1075
01:22:15,093 --> 01:22:16,238
Wait.

1076
01:22:16,387 --> 01:22:18,814
The two of you turned
the corner from Spring?

1077
01:22:20,035 --> 01:22:22,471
- Where were you before this?
- Round at my place.

1078
01:22:25,686 --> 01:22:27,633
You two are boyfriend and girlfriend?

1079
01:22:30,336 --> 01:22:31,980
Well, it's early stages, y'know.

1080
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:34,616
That right?

1081
01:22:35,017 --> 01:22:36,485
We've had a couple dates.

1082
01:22:46,728 --> 01:22:48,497
So you wanna go out to dinner next week?

1083
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,301
I'll go out to dinner with ya.

1084
01:22:55,003 --> 01:22:56,572
But I ain't gonna fuck ya.

1085
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,242
Well, I ain't gonna fuck you neither.

1086
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,111
I guess.

1087
01:23:18,984 --> 01:23:20,195
Burn victim.

1088
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:21,864
He's pretty heavily sedated.

1089
01:23:31,073 --> 01:23:32,341
Hey man?

1090
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:34,883
You doing okay? Jeez,

1091
01:23:35,878 --> 01:23:38,380
you got burned up pretty bad.

1092
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:42,351
You'll be okay though.

1093
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:45,921
You want a glass of orange juice?

1094
01:23:47,089 --> 01:23:48,991
I got a straw somewhere...

1095
01:23:50,012 --> 01:23:51,012
Hey.

1096
01:23:52,258 --> 01:23:53,662
Don't cry.

1097
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:57,332
You'll be okay.

1098
01:24:00,553 --> 01:24:02,271
I'm sorry, Welby.

1099
01:24:05,874 --> 01:24:08,210
- You know me?
- I'm sorry.

1100
01:24:10,766 --> 01:24:12,848
Sorry for what?

1101
01:24:14,546 --> 01:24:16,412
For throwing you out the window.

1102
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:26,395
- I'm sorry man.
- I don't care.

1103
01:24:26,919 --> 01:24:29,665
And stop fucking crying.

1104
01:24:30,131 --> 01:24:32,334
The salt'll just fuck up your wounds.

1105
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:35,237
I thought salt was supposed
to be good for wounds.

1106
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:37,506
Well what am I, a fucking doctor?!

1107
01:25:47,442 --> 01:25:48,651
Who is it?

1108
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:50,278
Oh you don't know me really.

1109
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:54,816
Well what you want?

1110
01:25:55,784 --> 01:25:57,386
I come about the billboards.

1111
01:25:57,853 --> 01:25:59,262
What about 'em?

1112
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:00,731
They got burned up.

1113
01:26:00,756 --> 01:26:01,756
I know that.

1114
01:26:02,977 --> 01:26:05,491
I'm one of the guys who put the
'em up in the first place.

1115
01:26:09,264 --> 01:26:10,264
Jerome.

1116
01:26:12,477 --> 01:26:13,869
What can I do for ya, Jerome?

1117
01:26:14,302 --> 01:26:16,672
Well, y'know, when you're putting
up a buncha posters like that,

1118
01:26:16,697 --> 01:26:19,116
just in case any of 'em
gets screwed up or torn,

1119
01:26:19,141 --> 01:26:22,244
they give ya a set of duplicates, y'know?

1120
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:25,213
No, I didn't know that.

1121
01:26:33,851 --> 01:26:36,825
Ladder's pretty steady
as it is, there, James.

1122
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:40,729
Oh, that's okay. I like holding ladders.

1123
01:26:40,996 --> 01:26:42,431
It takes me out of myself.

1124
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:50,067
- Need a hand?
- Hey.

1125
01:26:50,092 --> 01:26:52,382
- When'd you get out?
- Hour ago.

1126
01:26:52,407 --> 01:26:55,644
Judge threw it out, said the arrest
report weren't filled out right.

1127
01:26:57,345 --> 01:27:02,125
Say, you.

1128
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:05,239
Say, you didn't burn down
the police station, did ya?

1129
01:27:05,264 --> 01:27:07,264
No. She was with me the whole night.

1130
01:27:09,077 --> 01:27:10,845
- It's a long story.
- Okay.

1131
01:27:11,446 --> 01:27:12,446
- Okay.
- Hey.

1132
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:14,106
Hey.

1133
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,813
You sure you still wanna put up the
Willoughby one, him dead an' all?

1134
01:27:17,966 --> 01:27:20,168
Why not? He paid for it.

1135
01:27:20,535 --> 01:27:21,535
True.

1136
01:27:33,587 --> 01:27:36,034
Look, this fucking asshole.

1137
01:28:29,802 --> 01:28:31,206
Well, here we are

1138
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:34,676
here we are.

1139
01:28:37,112 --> 01:28:38,780
I like cheesy things.

1140
01:28:38,805 --> 01:28:40,649
I'm gonna look for cheesy things.

1141
01:28:41,416 --> 01:28:42,617
Alright.

1142
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:50,624
Who's that?

1143
01:28:51,293 --> 01:28:53,170
My ex-husband.

1144
01:28:53,195 --> 01:28:55,197
And his nineteen year old girlfriend.

1145
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,044
- You wanna leave?
- No, no.

1146
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:02,604
A deal's a deal.

1147
01:29:04,445 --> 01:29:06,046
It was fucking wild, man,

1148
01:29:06,071 --> 01:29:09,144
I think I was certifiably fucking
insane for a while back there.

1149
01:29:09,911 --> 01:29:11,556
When was this?

1150
01:29:11,581 --> 01:29:13,181
Bout nine, ten months ago.

1151
01:29:13,206 --> 01:29:16,059
- Were you on your own or what?
- No, had a couple buddies with me.

1152
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:18,295
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

1153
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,530
They fuck her too?

1154
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:23,291
I think they got their kicks
just watching, you know.

1155
01:29:23,316 --> 01:29:26,160
- Uhuh. Yeah?
- Yeah.

1156
01:29:26,328 --> 01:29:27,637
Was she hot?

1157
01:29:27,662 --> 01:29:30,578
After the gasoline kicked in she was hot.

1158
01:29:30,603 --> 01:29:33,301
That's when I really
wanted to fuck her even more.

1159
01:29:35,929 --> 01:29:37,929
I don't know if I could get that out.

1160
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:22,183
I ain't going down for that shit,
last fucking day down there...

1161
01:30:29,934 --> 01:30:32,235
He been there the whole time?

1162
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:33,297
Who?

1163
01:30:33,322 --> 01:30:36,409
Burnt-face-Jake. Keeps
fucking walking up and down.

1164
01:30:36,434 --> 01:30:37,899
I don't know. I don't think so.

1165
01:30:46,379 --> 01:30:48,009
- Another round.
- Yeah.

1166
01:30:51,142 --> 01:30:52,314
Eight bucks.

1167
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:26,348
Maestro.

1168
01:31:31,052 --> 01:31:32,587
Can I help you with something, man?

1169
01:31:32,954 --> 01:31:34,122
Excuse Me?

1170
01:31:34,456 --> 01:31:36,359
You've been looking over
here all fucking night,

1171
01:31:36,384 --> 01:31:38,068
now, unless you got
something to say to me,

1172
01:31:38,093 --> 01:31:41,188
why don't you take your burnt fucking
face and get the fuck outta here, okay?

1173
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:44,899
What are you doing?

1174
01:31:44,963 --> 01:31:48,036
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

1175
01:31:48,370 --> 01:31:49,938
Just trust me, okay?

1176
01:31:50,672 --> 01:31:51,940
You like magic?

1177
01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:57,746
- Just trust me...
- Just do the fucking trick.

1178
01:31:59,910 --> 01:32:00,910
Okay.

1179
01:32:09,891 --> 01:32:10,992
What the fuck?

1180
01:32:13,831 --> 01:32:14,996
Hey.

1181
01:32:15,969 --> 01:32:16,969
Hey!

1182
01:32:17,145 --> 01:32:19,401
- Hey! That's enough now!
- What's it to ya, fucker?

1183
01:32:19,426 --> 01:32:21,770
- The guy's a cop man! He's a cop!
- The guy's a cop man! He's a cop!

1184
01:32:23,141 --> 01:32:24,506
He ain't wearing no badge.

1185
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:26,808
I lost my badge.

1186
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:29,878
I can't remember where I lost it.

1187
01:32:29,911 --> 01:32:31,513
You started this, man!

1188
01:32:31,946 --> 01:32:33,348
I didn't do shit to you.

1189
01:32:33,815 --> 01:32:37,886
I know I started it. I
scratched you up like a bitch.

1190
01:32:37,911 --> 01:32:39,587
That's exactly fucking right...

1191
01:32:56,538 --> 01:32:58,206
Gotta use the little boys' room.

1192
01:33:10,285 --> 01:33:13,421
- You got something to say to me?
- You got something to say to me?

1193
01:33:13,446 --> 01:33:16,231
Doesn't shitgirl have a curfew weeknights?

1194
01:33:16,256 --> 01:33:20,570
No, no, in fact I was actually gonna
take her to the circus later,

1195
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:23,295
but there's no need now. Does he juggle?

1196
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:26,910
Look I'm having one dinner with the
guy cos he did me a favor, okay?

1197
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:28,637
You don't have to explain
yourself to me cos

1198
01:33:28,662 --> 01:33:30,339
you're having dinner
with a midget, Mildred.

1199
01:33:30,364 --> 01:33:33,041
- I'm not explaining myself to you.
- You kinda are.

1200
01:33:38,558 --> 01:33:40,849
Look, I didn't come over
to break your balls,

1201
01:33:40,874 --> 01:33:43,251
you can date as many midgets as you want.

1202
01:33:43,504 --> 01:33:45,093
No,

1203
01:33:45,118 --> 01:33:48,256
I came over to say I was sorry, actually.

1204
01:33:48,348 --> 01:33:49,999
Sorry for what?

1205
01:33:50,024 --> 01:33:52,293
I'm sorry about what happened
to your billboards an' all.

1206
01:33:52,318 --> 01:33:53,670
Yeah well,

1207
01:33:53,695 --> 01:33:56,739
that's all water under the bridge now, I guess.
- Good

1208
01:33:56,764 --> 01:34:00,402
I'm glad. I was pretty drunk,
but it still don't excuse it.

1209
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:04,596
All this anger, man,

1210
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:08,144
Penelope said to me the other day,

1211
01:34:08,169 --> 01:34:11,854
it just begets greater anger,

1212
01:34:11,879 --> 01:34:13,323
y'know?

1213
01:34:13,548 --> 01:34:14,759
And it's true.

1214
01:34:17,118 --> 01:34:18,820
Penelope said 'Begets'?

1215
01:34:20,221 --> 01:34:21,221
Yeah,

1216
01:34:22,357 --> 01:34:24,392
'It begets greater anger'.

1217
01:34:29,731 --> 01:34:32,742
You take care of this
little lady, okay sport?

1218
01:34:32,767 --> 01:34:35,436
Big lady, compared to you, right?

1219
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:47,724
- You alright?
- I think I'd like to go home now.

1220
01:34:47,749 --> 01:34:50,652
Don't gimme any shit, James? We can
do this another time, alright?

1221
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:55,598
Why would I wanna do this another time?
You've been

1222
01:34:55,623 --> 01:34:57,920
embarrassed to be here
ever since we arrived.

1223
01:34:57,945 --> 01:34:59,169
- Oh for Christ's sakes,

1224
01:34:59,194 --> 01:35:00,895
I didn't force you to come on this date,

1225
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:04,541
alright? You forced me.

1226
01:35:04,566 --> 01:35:05,566
Forced you?

1227
01:35:07,335 --> 01:35:09,802
I asked you on a date.

1228
01:35:09,827 --> 01:35:12,594
Wow! Well, y'know,

1229
01:35:12,619 --> 01:35:13,983
I know

1230
01:35:14,008 --> 01:35:15,810
I ain't much of a catch, okay?

1231
01:35:16,277 --> 01:35:20,557
I know I'm a dwarf who sells used cars
and has a drinking problem, I know that.

1232
01:35:20,582 --> 01:35:22,559
But who the hell are you, man?

1233
01:35:22,584 --> 01:35:25,795
You're that Billboard Lady
who never ever smiles,

1234
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:27,996
who never has a good word
to say about anybody,

1235
01:35:28,021 --> 01:35:31,892
and who, in the evening times, SETS
FUCKING FIRE TO POLICE STATIONS!

1236
01:35:33,476 --> 01:35:36,731
And I'M the one who's not a catch?!

1237
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:39,833
Hey!

1238
01:35:41,336 --> 01:35:44,966
Y'know I didn't have to
come and hold your ladder!

1239
01:36:10,531 --> 01:36:11,966
Now don't make a scene.

1240
01:36:15,189 --> 01:36:18,481
Did you really tell him
“Anger begets greater anger”?

1241
01:36:18,506 --> 01:36:20,132
Oh! Yes!

1242
01:36:20,157 --> 01:36:21,863
I did! I didn't make it up myself though.

1243
01:36:21,888 --> 01:36:26,016
I can't claim that! No, I
read it on a bookmark.

1244
01:36:27,382 --> 01:36:29,788
Which was in a book I was reading.

1245
01:36:30,718 --> 01:36:32,220
About polio.

1246
01:36:33,421 --> 01:36:36,803
Polo. No, which is the one
with the horses? Polio?

1247
01:36:36,828 --> 01:36:37,959
- Polo?
- Polo.

1248
01:36:49,737 --> 01:36:51,297
Be nice to her, Charlie.

1249
01:36:53,408 --> 01:36:54,676
You got that?

1250
01:37:08,082 --> 01:37:09,684
Jason!

1251
01:37:10,284 --> 01:37:13,828
Just leave me, don't look at me, Momma.

1252
01:37:13,904 --> 01:37:15,129
You..

1253
01:37:15,154 --> 01:37:16,789
No! Do not!

1254
01:37:16,898 --> 01:37:18,933
Don't.

1255
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:21,235
Open up this door!

1256
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:23,671
Please, Jason.

1257
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:26,507
I'll help you.

1258
01:37:30,842 --> 01:37:33,948
Please, open the door.

1259
01:37:34,415 --> 01:37:35,415
Please.

1260
01:37:37,719 --> 01:37:39,687
Please.

1261
01:37:42,805 --> 01:37:43,805
Please.

1262
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:47,528
Please, open the door.

1263
01:37:55,670 --> 01:37:56,971
Open up!

1264
01:37:58,858 --> 01:38:00,541
Jason!

1265
01:38:01,646 --> 01:38:03,077
I'm alright, Momma.

1266
01:38:03,611 --> 01:38:05,346
It's all gonna be alright.

1267
01:38:29,640 --> 01:38:32,515
I don't wanna get your hopes up,
alright, but there's a guy,

1268
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:34,584
and I think he might be the guy.

1269
01:38:34,609 --> 01:38:36,605
I got his DNA.

1270
01:38:36,630 --> 01:38:38,688
I got a lot of it, actually.

1271
01:38:38,713 --> 01:38:41,783
They're making the checks as we speak.
- He's in jail?

1272
01:38:42,784 --> 01:38:45,520
No, but he ain't gonna be hard to find.

1273
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:47,897
Why do you think he's the guy?

1274
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:50,358
I heard him talking about
something that he did to a girl

1275
01:38:50,383 --> 01:38:51,834
in the middle of last year.

1276
01:38:51,859 --> 01:38:55,138
I couldn't hear all of it, but

1277
01:38:55,163 --> 01:38:59,642
it sounded a lot like
what happened to Angela.

1278
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:01,744
Then he beat the crap outta me.

1279
01:39:01,769 --> 01:39:03,379
But cos of that

1280
01:39:03,404 --> 01:39:05,306
I got a bunch of his DNA.

1281
01:39:05,973 --> 01:39:08,651
So I wanted

1282
01:39:08,676 --> 01:39:13,675
to let you know sooner rather than later. I
didn't want you to give up hope, y'know?

1283
01:39:14,515 --> 01:39:16,217
I've been trying not to.

1284
01:39:18,653 --> 01:39:21,622
Well, all you can do is
try, as my Momma says.

1285
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:26,102
Not so much about hope as about...

1286
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:27,462
well, I didn't used to be

1287
01:39:27,487 --> 01:39:29,806
very good at English at school,

1288
01:39:29,831 --> 01:39:32,400
so it was more “All you can do is try...

1289
01:39:32,425 --> 01:39:34,837
to not be so crap at English.”

1290
01:39:36,671 --> 01:39:40,049
Cos you need English, really,
if you wanna be a cop.

1291
01:39:40,074 --> 01:39:41,542
If you wanna be anything.

1292
01:39:41,942 --> 01:39:42,942
Really.

1293
01:39:49,116 --> 01:39:51,319
Unless you live in Mexico or something.

1294
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,222
But who wants that?

1295
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:16,848
Hey, Dixon.

1296
01:40:21,983 --> 01:40:22,983
Thank you!

1297
01:40:57,063 --> 01:40:58,686
You did good, Jason.

1298
01:40:59,253 --> 01:41:01,022
You did real good.

1299
01:41:09,764 --> 01:41:11,365
But he wasn't the guy.

1300
01:41:18,839 --> 01:41:20,182
What?

1301
01:41:20,207 --> 01:41:22,318
There was no match to the DNA,

1302
01:41:22,343 --> 01:41:25,154
no matches to any other
crimes of this nature,

1303
01:41:25,179 --> 01:41:27,790
to any crimes at all, in fact.

1304
01:41:27,815 --> 01:41:30,726
And his record is clean.

1305
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:32,995
Maybe he was just bragging.

1306
01:41:33,020 --> 01:41:34,355
He wasn't just bragging.

1307
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:38,501
Well, that's as may be. But
at the time of Angela's death

1308
01:41:38,526 --> 01:41:40,536
he wasn't even in the country.

1309
01:41:40,768 --> 01:41:42,338
Where was he?

1310
01:41:42,363 --> 01:41:45,132
But I've seen his records of
entry and exit to the States,

1311
01:41:45,157 --> 01:41:48,277
and I've spoken to his Commanding Officer.

1312
01:41:48,302 --> 01:41:50,340
He wasn't in the country, Dixon.

1313
01:41:50,365 --> 01:41:51,706
He ain't our guy.

1314
01:41:52,579 --> 01:41:54,008
No, he ..

1315
01:41:56,210 --> 01:42:00,583
He might not be our guy, but he still
done something shitty. I know he did.

1316
01:42:00,608 --> 01:42:02,216
Not in Missouri he didn't.

1317
01:42:02,984 --> 01:42:04,839
Where was he?

1318
01:42:04,864 --> 01:42:06,887
That's classified information.	*

1319
01:42:06,912 --> 01:42:08,756
Come on, man.

1320
01:42:09,007 --> 01:42:11,434
If the guy's got a Commanding Officer,

1321
01:42:11,459 --> 01:42:14,295
and if the guy got back to
the country nine months ago,

1322
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:17,465
and if the country where
he was is classified,

1323
01:42:17,525 --> 01:42:19,525
which country do you think he was in?

1324
01:42:21,068 --> 01:42:22,770
Hey, you know ..

1325
01:42:25,022 --> 01:42:26,307
I'll give you a clue.

1326
01:42:28,342 --> 01:42:29,477
It was sandy.

1327
01:42:33,948 --> 01:42:35,783
That doesn't really narrow it down.

1328
01:42:38,419 --> 01:42:40,029
All you need to know is,

1329
01:42:40,054 --> 01:42:43,366
he didn't do nothing to Angela Hayes.

1330
01:42:43,391 --> 01:42:46,337
So we're gonna keep looking.

1331
01:42:50,865 --> 01:42:51,865
Alright?

1332
01:43:02,970 --> 01:43:04,945
I found my badge after all.

1333
01:44:12,813 --> 01:44:14,457
Hello?

1334
01:44:14,482 --> 01:44:15,482
It's Dixon.

1335
01:44:20,921 --> 01:44:21,921
Tell me.

1336
01:44:25,025 --> 01:44:26,660
He wasn't the guy.

1337
01:44:42,643 --> 01:44:43,643
Mildred?

1338
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:55,589
Are you're sure?

1339
01:44:57,668 --> 01:45:01,061
He, um, he wasn't even in the
country when it happened.

1340
01:45:02,797 --> 01:45:06,108
So, whatever he did,

1341
01:45:06,133 --> 01:45:07,735
he didn't do it round here.

1342
01:45:09,370 --> 01:45:11,305
I'm sorry I got your hopes up.

1343
01:45:12,139 --> 01:45:13,808
It's alright.

1344
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:19,914
At least I had a day of hoping. Which
is more than I've had for a while.

1345
01:45:27,454 --> 01:45:29,114
I'd better go.

1346
01:45:32,314 --> 01:45:35,204
There was

1347
01:45:35,229 --> 01:45:37,264
there was one thing I was thinking.

1348
01:45:40,134 --> 01:45:41,767
What's that?

1349
01:45:42,269 --> 01:45:45,514
Well... I know he isn't your rapist.

1350
01:45:45,539 --> 01:45:47,883
He is a rapist, though.

1351
01:45:47,908 --> 01:45:49,577
I'm sure of that.

1352
01:45:57,985 --> 01:45:59,320
What are you saying to me?

1353
01:46:01,755 --> 01:46:03,390
I got his license plate.

1354
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:07,995
I know where he lives.

1355
01:46:11,131 --> 01:46:12,737
Where's he live?

1356
01:46:14,561 --> 01:46:16,029
Lives in Idaho.

1357
01:46:22,276 --> 01:46:24,209
That's funny.

1358
01:46:26,981 --> 01:46:29,534
I'm driving to Idaho in the morning.

1359
01:46:34,725 --> 01:46:37,191
Want some company?

1360
01:46:41,751 --> 01:46:43,071
Sure.

1361
01:49:24,958 --> 01:49:26,360
Hey, Dixon.

1362
01:49:26,411 --> 01:49:27,694
Yeah?

1363
01:49:28,451 --> 01:49:30,724
I need to tell you something.

1364
01:49:32,331 --> 01:49:35,211
It was me who burned
down the police station.

1365
01:49:37,538 --> 01:49:40,364
Well, who the Hell else would it have been?

1366
01:49:52,019 --> 01:49:53,253
Dixon?

1367
01:49:54,166 --> 01:49:55,488
Yep?

1368
01:49:55,513 --> 01:49:57,818
You sure about this?

1369
01:49:57,843 --> 01:49:59,949
About killing this guy?

1370
01:50:01,862 --> 01:50:03,208
Not really.

1371
01:50:03,233 --> 01:50:04,233
You?

1372
01:50:07,253 --> 01:50:08,535
Not really.

1373
01:50:11,338 --> 01:50:13,407
I guess we can decide along the way.

1374
01:50:13,431 --> 01:50:15,431
