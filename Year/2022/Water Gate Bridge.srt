00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,782
<i>How stingy of you!</i>

188
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,620
<i>Commander Yang,</i>

189
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,455
<i>please.</i>

190
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,336
<i>Surround the airstrip</i>

191
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,421
<i>and blow up their planes!</i>

192
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,258
<i>Wu Qianli,</i>

193
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:11,554
<i>don't worry.</i>

194
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,897
Charge!

195
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:23,816
<i>Maintain the formation!</i>

196
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,235
<i>Give me an update on the situation down there.</i>

197
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,778
<i>The enemy are surrounding us.</i>

198
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,323
<i>They are coming from everywhere
and they are coming fast!</i>

199
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:32,700
<i>1st Platoon, charge down there</i>

200
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:33,534
<i>with the commander!</i>

201
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:36,871
<i>Keep a safe distance.</i>

202
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,456
<i>And follow the points of impact!</i>

203
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,500
Charge!

204
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,636
<i>Towards where the 7th Company strikes,</i>

205
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,304
<i>keep a 150—meter distance.</i>

206
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:54,931
<i>Creeping barrage,</i>

207
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:56,265
<i>5 Site up!</i>

208
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,642
<i>Leftward 17 mil.</i>

209
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,353
<i>5 site up! Leftward 17 mil!</i>

210
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:03,689
<i>Fire!</i>

211
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,607
<i>Fire!</i>

212
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,036
<i>All medical staff,</i>

213
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,788
<i>assist wounded to airlift point.</i>

214
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:19,705
<i>Move fast.</i>

215
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,540
<i>Red alert.</i>

216
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,667
<i>Proceed to Whiskey tower west side.</i>

217
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,544
<i>Direction enemy.</i>

218
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,545
<i>Wait departure orders.</i>

219
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:26,671
<i>Get him up! Let's go!</i>

220
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,130
<i>Move it!</i>

221
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,049
<i>I want that runway protected at all cost!</i>

222
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,175
<i>Get me the line to Tokyo.</i>

223
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:31,884
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

224
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,685
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

225
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,270
<i>we're honored to be here today</i>

226
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,897
<i>to celebrate a very special event</i>

227
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,691
<i>here in the Congressional Hall.</i>

228
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:52,113
<i>We're here to celebrate 5 years since 1945.</i>

229
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,574
<i>And for that we have only one man to thank.</i>

230
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,200
<i>Urgent news from the front, sir.</i>

231
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,370
<i>And whose vision has
brought these glories to fruition.</i>

232
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,624
<i>General Douglas MacArthur!</i>

233
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:04,875
<i>MacArthur here.</i>

234
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,920
<i>Sir, Tokyo on the line.</i>

235
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,298
<i>Yes. General.</i>

236
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:12,800
<i>Task officer O.P. Smith reporting.</i>

237
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,176
<i>As of right now,</i>

238
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,846
<i>Hagaru-ri airstrip is the rear line.</i>

239
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,849
<i>We don't have enough troops to hold off the enemy.</i>

240
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,517
<i>I'm requesting reinforcements</i>

241
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,977
<i>to support our withdrawal route.</i>

242
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:24,353
<i>General, our troops need to get out of...</i>

243
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,313
<i>Smith!</i>

244
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,689
<i>This is war!</i>

245
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,983
<i>Retreating is treason!</i>

246
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:30,818
<i>I repeat!</i>

247
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,195
<i>Retreating is treason!</i>

248
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,281
<i>You think he knows we can hear him?</i>

249
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,283
<i>Stop all retreating maneuvers!</i>

250
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,784
<i>- General!
- That's an order!</i>

251
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,870
<i>Your request is denied!</i>

252
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,552
<i>Can that plane take off?</i>

253
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,219
<i>No, sir.</i>

254
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,889
<i>They are stuck
right in the middle of the fire line, sir!</i>

255
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:05,895
<i>God!</i>

256
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,358
<i>Go! go!</i>

257
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:11,817
<i>This way! Get up there!</i>

258
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:12,777
<i>Fire!</i>

259
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,287
<i>- Reload!
- Fire!</i>

260
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:24,622
<i>Fire!</i>

261
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:29,835
<i>Fire!</i>

262
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,257
<i>Go! Let's go!</i>

263
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,176
<i>We got everybody on board, Captain.</i>

264
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,678
<i>Got it! Get ready!</i>

265
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,431
<i>Fire!</i>

266
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,531
<i>Turn the other one around!</i>

267
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,366
<i>Have it take off from the main road!</i>

268
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,659
<i>C°PY that!</i>

269
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:06,372
<i>Move!</i>

270
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,926
<i>Send reinforcements out to the Sumun Bridge</i>

271
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,302
<i>as soon as possible.</i>

272
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,471
<i>Call the bombers to clear the route right now!</i>

273
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,349
<i>I'll go ahead and take command
of the 1st Marine Division.</i>

274
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:28,102
<i>Lead them out on the road to
Hungnam Harbor, clear?</i>

275
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:28,811
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

276
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:31,897
<i>Gmgo!</i>

277
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,089
<i>We made it.</i>

278
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,424
<i>We gonna be okay.</i>

279
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,817
<i>All units, full retreat!</i>

280
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,819
<i>Get your men and get out of here!</i>

281
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,197
<i>Everybody in the trucks!</i>

282
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:22,948
<i>Evacuate! Move it! Move it!</i>

283
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:31,916
<i>Watch out!</i>

284
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,142
<i>Wu Qianli!</i>

285
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,896
<i>Go seize four more cannons for us!</i>

286
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,286
<i>2 site down!</i>

287
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,371
<i>Okay-</i>

288
00:22:10,371 --> 00:22:11,080
<i>Fire!</i>

289
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,046
<i>The U.S. forces at Hagaru-ri</i>

290
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,172
<i>have already given up</i>

291
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,924
<i>and started to evacuate towards the south.</i>

292
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:06,719
<i>According to our reports,</i>

293
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,178
<i>the U.S. doesn't have enough cargo capacity.</i>

294
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,972
<i>Smith is taking the rest of the troops</i>

295
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:11,974
<i>and retreating towards the Hungnam Port
through the Sumun Bridge.</i>

296
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,685
<i>The Sumun Bridge is their only route to retreat.</i>

297
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:15,978
<i>Only if we bomb it</i>

298
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,022
<i>can our units get a chance to besiege them.</i>

299
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:19,356
<i>Yes!</i>

300
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,983
<i>Send a unit to launch penetration attacks.</i>

301
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,651
<i>We can't let them escape!</i>

302
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,904
<i>Order assigned forces to block them</i>

303
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,280
<i>and cut off their retreat.</i>

304
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,948
<i>The 9th Company is already close
to the Sumun Bridge.</i>

305
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,825
<i>The 7th Company of the 1st Storming Regiment</i>

306
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,659
<i>is qualified for the mission.</i>

307
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:33,203
<i>However, the 7th Company is at the airport now.</i>

308
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:35,956
<i>Order the 7th Company to withdraw from battle</i>

309
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,458
<i>and head towards the Sumun Bridge immediately.</i>

310
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,542
<i>Blast the bridge!</i>

311
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,377
<i>When our reinforcements arrive,</i>

312
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,670
<i>annihilate the U.S. 1st Marine Division.</i>

313
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:42,463
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

314
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:43,672
<i>Notify the 7th Company now.</i>

315
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,423
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

316
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,512
<i>7th Company, keep "P!</i>

317
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,518
<i>Check the room in the south.</i>

318
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,353
<i>Beware of ambush.</i>

319
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,405
<i>Put the ammo box here.</i>

320
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,365
There's more here.

321
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,824
<i>2nd Squad, count them. Hurry!</i>

322
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,792
<i>The retreat route has been cleared of the enemy.</i>

323
00:24:20,668 --> 00:24:23,420
<i>Are there any wounded remaining at the airstrip?</i>

324
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,381
<i>Hagaru-ri,</i>

325
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:26,715
<i>do you copy?</i>

326
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:30,177
<i>All units,</i>

327
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,263
<i>the retreat route has been cleared of the enemy.</i>

328
00:24:34,098 --> 00:24:36,892
<i>Confirmed 500 reds wiped out over.</i>

329
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,186
<i>I repeat...</i>

330
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:40,187
<i>Are...</i>

331
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,023
<i>Those who can still walk, go over there.</i>

332
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:44,650
<i>Get the wounded into the room.</i>

333
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,444
<i>Put the medical supplies in the tent.</i>

334
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:49,863
<i>Put him on the bed.</i>

335
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,864
<i>Check his condition later.</i>

336
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,537
<i>How many?</i>

337
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,455
<i>Almost 207</i>

338
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:01,917
<i>Never mind.</i>

339
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:06,922
<i>I'll make sure you all go home alive.</i>

340
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:10,509
<i>We will.</i>

341
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,516
<i>Your frostbite is too bad.</i>

342
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,642
<i>This will hurt a bit.</i>

343
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,393
<i>I'll apply some ointment to it.</i>

344
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,027
<i>I'm alright, Commander Zhang.</i>

345
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,154
<i>Stop pretending.</i>

346
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:13,572
<i>We know it hurts.</i>

347
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,782
<i>Take the badly wounded to the front line hospital.</i>

348
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,575
<i>Yes, sir! I'll notify the corpsman.</i>

349
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,206
<i>Come, it's less windy here.</i>

350
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,040
<i>It's not that cold.</i>

351
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,501
<i>Bro, is it ready?</i>

352
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,376
<i>Almost.</i>

353
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,503
<i>Wait a second. I'll be done soon.</i>

354
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:33,383
There's more here.

355
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,385
<i>All commanders, time for meeting.</i>

356
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,229
<i>Each platoon report your casualties.</i>

357
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,235
<i>1st Platoon downsized by 23 men.</i>

358
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,327
<i>2nd Platoon downsized by 21 men.</i>

359
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,288
<i>3rd Platoon downsized by 18 men.</i>

360
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,965
<i>4th Platoon, 16 casualties.</i>

361
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,228
<i>78</i>

362
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:43,579
<i>Only 9 Party members remain in our company.</i>

363
00:27:44,413 --> 00:27:47,166
<i>This is a critical moment. Get yourself together.</i>

364
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:48,750
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

<i>it's the HQ.</i>

367
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,199
<i>This is Zhang Zhuang speaking.</i>

368
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:45,325
<i>HQ here.</i>

369
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,618
<i>7th Company march south</i>

370
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:47,536

371
00:29:47,828 --> 00:29:50,372
<i>Stay at 1081 Highland when you
reach the Sumun Bridge.</i>

372
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:51,164
<i>Wait for the order</i>

373
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,416
<i>of blasting the bridge.</i>

374
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:53,500
<i>Do you copy?</i>

375
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:54,960
<i>COPY-</i>

379
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:03,218
<i>In the future,</i>

380
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,594
<i>we will have our own planes</i>

381
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,596
<i>way better than theirs.</i>

382
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:16,773
<i>Just a matter of time.</i>

383
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,153
<i>Get ready for departure.</i>

384
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,487
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

385
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,474
<i>Come in please.</i>

386
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,645
<i>Mr. President,</i>

387
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,522
<i>telegram from Far East Command.</i>

388
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:01,526
<i>General MacArthur is still pushing for
use of the A-bomb.</i>

389
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,697
<i>He believes this will bring the turning point
we need to win the war.</i>

390
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,449
<i>He is awaiting your response.</i>

391
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:10,869
<i>MacArthur must be reminded</i>

392
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,121
<i>that this war is bigger than one man.</i>

393
00:31:13,455 --> 00:31:14,915
<i>Yes, Mr. President.</i>

394
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,462
<i>We will take whatever steps are necessary</i>

395
00:31:20,462 --> 00:31:22,339
<i>to meet the military situation</i>

396
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,091
<i>just as we always have.</i>

397
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:27,469
<i>Mr. President,</i>

398
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:29,346
<i>Does that include use of the atomic bomb?</i>

399
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,472
<i>Mr. President,</i>

400
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,099
<i>perhaps it would be better if we are allowed</i>

401
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,184
<i>to quote your remarks on that directly?</i>

402
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:36,520
<i>Does this mean that we
wouldn't use the atomic bomb</i>

403
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,897
<i>except on a United Nations authorization?</i>

404
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,650
<i>The action against communist China</i>

405
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:44,528
<i>depends on the action of the United Nations.</i>

406
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:48,281
<i>Mr. President...</i>

407
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,581
<i>Grab him.</i>

408
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:57,499
<i>Pull him up.</i>

409
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,209
<i>Stand up back there.</i>

410
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,169
<i>Someone fell into the snow.</i>

411
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,754
<i>We can't see the road ahead</i>

412
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,589
<i>in such heavy snow.</i>

413
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,426
<i>One, two, three, pull!</i>

414
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,936
<i>Tell back row to stop!</i>

415
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:20,605
<i>Back row, stop!</i>

416
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,377
<i>Does the compass still work?</i>

417
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,796
<i>Damn, it's frozen.</i>

418
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,506
<i>We've gone so far</i>

419
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,550
<i>and still can't see a sign of the Sumun Bridge.</i>

420
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,005
<i>Everyone stay alert!</i>

421
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:29,174
<i>1st Platoon, stop and stay alert!</i>

422
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,718
<i>3rd and 4th Platoons, stop and stay alert!</i>

423
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,328
<i>Yu Congrong, the radio transmitter.</i>

424
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,288
<i>Wanli, give me the radio transmitter.</i>

425
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,165
<i>This should be the Sumun Bridge.</i>

426
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,875
<i>Is that the 9th Company blasting the bridge?</i>

427
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,170
<i>I can't tell.</i>

428
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,131
<i>The 9th Company should have
received blasting orders before us.</i>

429
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,800
<i>Can you reach the HQ?</i>

430
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,717
<i>The batteries are frozen.</i>

431
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,510
<i>It's down.</i>

432
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:29,526
<i>Save them first.</i>

433
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,443
<i>Co!</i>

434
00:34:31,653 --> 00:34:32,612
<i>You protect the radio transmitter.</i>

435
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,073
<i>I'll leave it to you.</i>

436
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:35,699
<i>Okay-</i>

437
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:37,867

<i>Hurry!</i>

448
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:23,705
<i>There are landmines.</i>

449
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,040
<i>Be careful, everyone!</i>

450
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:31,171
<i>Throw that frag back!</i>

451

<i>Commander!</i>

00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,574
<i>Take the commander away.</i>

461
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,159
<i>Don't mind me.
Split and save them.</i>

462
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:01,701
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

463
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,410
<i>Don't leave anyone behind.</i>

464
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:11,795
<i>Commander; all the wounded were taken</i> away.

<i>Yes, sir.</i>

540
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:33,593

<i>All these distracted the enemy's attention.</i>

548
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,069
<i>On the south side,</i>

549
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,571
<i>the 1st Platoon disguised as wounded U.S. soldiers</i>

550
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,448
<i>while being covered by the 3rd and 4th Platoons.</i>

551
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,657
<i>By infiltrating into the enemy,</i>

552
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:58,409
<i>they could blast the bridge.</i>

553
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,078
<i>However, they all got caught.</i>

554
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,788
<i>But they managed to take the dynamite pack</i>

555
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,331
<i>onto the bridge before they were killed.</i>

556
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,293
<i>At the crucial moment,</i>

557
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,711
<i>the commander fired the Bazooka</i>

558
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:09,837
<i>and it blew up the dynamite pack.</i>

559
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:12,340
<i>But there weren't enough explosives</i>

560
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,842
<i>to collapse the bridge.</i>

561
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,928
<i>The operation failed.</i>

562
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,390
<i>Over this way, boys, over this way.</i>

563
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:25,478
<i>Took those assholes a whole night
just to crack this little hole?</i>

564
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,147
<i>The bridge is our only option.</i>

565
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,941
<i>And must be.</i>

566
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,026
<i>Can't we just fly these boys out?</i>

567
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:34,320
<i>It will be faster than try to fix this.</i>

568
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:37,365
<i>We are talking about something we don't have.</i>

569
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,908
<i>The runway is gone.</i>

570
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,369
<i>Are we all clear on</i>

571
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,079
<i>the enemy's deployment of firepower?</i>

572
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,629
<i>Are the troops in position?</i>

573
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,090
<i>Yes sir, as requested.</i>

574
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:55,716
<i>Stay alert.</i>

575
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,554
<i>There's nothing stopping these guys
from attacking during the day.</i>

576
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:00,596
<i>Understood.</i>

577
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,515
<i>All units are in position, sir.</i>

578
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,395
<i>The ground is hot</i>

579
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,479
<i>after bombed by incendiaries.</i>

580
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,273
<i>Bury the batteries in the ground.</i>

581
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:11,858
<i>Our batteries might have come back to life.</i>

582
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:20,867
<i>Yu,</i>

583
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,578
<i>our border is over there.</i>

584
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:26,581
<i>That is home.</i>

585
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,879
<i>Exactly.</i>

586
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:37,091
<i>That's our motherland.</i>

587
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,857
<i>Our scout is coming back.</i>

588
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,693
<i>He's from the 9th Company.</i>

589
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:06,370
<i>Commander, Tian Xiangnan is back.</i>

590
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,290
<i>He's from the 9th company.</i>

591
00:45:17,006 --> 00:45:18,007
<i>Commander,</i>

592
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:19,967
<i>I have found</i>

593
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,180
<i>their headquarters.</i>

594
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,186
<i>You want to raid their HQ?</i>

595
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,649
<i>It's too cold to stand up.</i>

596
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:37,360
<i>We can't even pull the bolt from our rifles.</i>

597
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,654
<i>With ten dynamite packs</i>

598
00:45:39,654 --> 00:45:41,322
<i>and two bazookas only,</i>

599
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:42,907
<i>how could we fight them?</i>

600
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:48,829
<i>Even if you catch their commander,</i>

601
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,915
<i>can we blast the bridge successfully?</i>

602
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:54,961
<i>What if the plan fails?</i>

603
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,673
<i>The 7th Company continues to blast the bridge.</i>

604
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,175
<i>They would certainly call for reinforcements.</i>

605
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,220
<i>Then it'll be harder to fight them.</i>

606
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,138
<i>Tell me.</i>

607
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,474
<i>Is there any easy battle?</i>

608
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,228
<i>The harder it is,</i>

609
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,105
<i>the more determined we should be.</i>

610
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,151
<i>Our army has already set a strategic plan.</i>

611
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,487
<i>It's to cut off their only route to retreat.</i>

612
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,447
<i>So they'll have</i>

613
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,157
<i>nowhere to run.</i>

614
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,034
<i>Remember,</i>

615
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,327
<i>there is no if.</i>

616
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:38,629
Commander.

617
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:39,922
<i>Where is the wound?</i>

618
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,768
<i>Our commander was shot last night</i>

619
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:53,978
<i>during a mission.</i>

620
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,700
<i>The plane opened its butt end</i>

621
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,618
<i>and poured down bullets and bombs.</i>

622
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,913
<i>After that, our men in yellow uniforms</i>

623
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,374
<i>dropped one after another.</i>

624
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,585
<i>What should we call those brothers</i>

625
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:19,920
<i>who were sacrificed?</i>

626
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,424
<i>What should we call those who froze to death</i>

627
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:24,759
<i>after marching for 6 days and 6 nights</i>

628
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,304
<i>without any food or sleep?</i>

629
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,015
<i>There aren't any heroes
who will never freeze to death,</i>

630
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,017
<i>let alone ones who will never be killed.</i>

631
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:34,602
<i>A soldier only lives for honor and glory.</i>

632
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,778
<i>The heavier the enemy's firepower is,</i>

633
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,072
<i>the stronger we will be.</i>

634
00:48:29,115 --> 00:48:30,699
<i>We must show them</i>

635
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:32,701
<i>we're not to be trifled with.</i>

636
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,916
<i>What's the ammo situation at the secondary location?</i>

637
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:25,129
<i>last time we checked,
we had double the amount we requested.</i>

638
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,425
<i>76 AP, 30.</i>

639
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,636
<i>105 HP, 60.</i>

640
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,764
<i>30 CAL heavy machine gun, 2.</i>

641
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,933
<i>B.A.R, 6.</i>

642
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,853
<i>60mm mortar, 6.</i>

643
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:44,064
<i>MK2 pineapples, 500.</i>

644
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:47,067
<i>30 CAL carbine bullets, 5000.</i>

645
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:51,155
<i>Test 123...</i>

646
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,531
<i>Good afternoon, sir.</i>

647
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:53,949
<i>Good news, sir.</i>

648
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,409
<i>Reinforcements are on their way.</i>

649
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,661
<i>It won't take them more than 18 hours.</i>

650
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,454
<i>Sir,</i>

651
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,164
<i>we are waiting the next order.</i>

652
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:01,916
<i>We are maintaining hourly contact.</i>

653
00:50:04,627 --> 00:50:06,378
<i>3rd Battalion, 7th Regiment,</i>

654
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:07,296
<i>on the move.</i>

655
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,340
<i>Minimal enemy activity detected.</i>

656
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:12,760
<i>Reinforcements reassured. Arrival on time.</i>

657
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:13,636
<i>Over.</i>

658
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:16,263
<i>On time.</i>

659
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,140
<i>Well, Brad.</i>

660
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,141
<i>That's a blessing.</i>

661
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:23,646
<i>Have you ever played hide and seek?</i>

662
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:24,980
<i>Played hide and seek, sir?</i>

663
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,191
— <i>Yep.</i>
<i>- I haven't done so for a long time,</i>

664
00:50:27,316 --> 00:50:28,567
<i>certainly not at Christmas.</i>

665
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,236
<i>Well, we're gonna have to do it here.</i>

666
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,696
<i>We're gonna surprise them.</i>

667
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,157
<i>Go invisible,</i>

668
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,784
<i>lure them on the bridge,</i>

669
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:40,621
<i>then jump out like jack Rabbit
and squash them roaches.</i>

670
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:41,956
<i>Call it a day.</i>

671
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,301
<i>Based on the old commander's plan,</i>

672
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,220
<i>the 7th and 9th Companies shall cooperate</i>

673
00:50:57,513 --> 00:50:59,014
<i>and split up in 4 units.</i>

674
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:00,975
<i>I'll take Yu Congrong and Wanli</i>

675
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:02,810
<i>to raid the U.S. HQ,</i>

676
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,186
<i>capture their commander</i>

677
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:05,646
<i>and force them to surrender.</i>

678
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:08,148
<i>Mei Sheng and He Changgui</i>

679
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:10,150
<i>will attack the south and north side</i>

680
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,110
<i>of the bridge,</i>

681
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:12,695
<i>knock down their watchtower</i>

682
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:14,280
<i>for attrition.</i>

683
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,031
<i>Ping He</i>

684
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,408
<i>will lead the 9th Company</i>

685
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:18,659
<i>to go through the pipes</i>

686
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:20,786
<i>and seize the Pump House.</i>

687
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:23,080
<i>Once the bridge is under control,</i>

688
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,373
<i>wait for my osprey whistle</i>

689
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,457
<i>and blast it.</i>

690
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,255
<i>What's the Pump House?</i>

691
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,132
<i>The Pump House...</i>

692
00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:35,426
<i>The Pump House is their heart.</i>

693
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,762
<i>You're the best bazooka shooter
in the 7th Company.</i>

694
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,014
<i>Remember.</i>

695
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,390
<i>Don't move before the first firing point</i>

696
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,725
<i>is blown up.</i>

697
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:44,435
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

698
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:45,686
<i>Commander,</i>

699
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,815
<i>I have something to tell Wanli.</i>

700
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,402
<i>Save them</i>

701
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,446
<i>until we've finished the battle.</i>

702
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,293
<i>Wanli,</i>

703
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,713
<i>Commander Baili</i>

704
00:52:14,173 --> 00:52:15,633
<i>died because of me</i>

705
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:17,343
<i>back then.</i>

706
00:52:19,637 --> 00:52:21,513
<i>I'm so sorry for that.</i>

707
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:42,868
<i>Baili is my brother</i>

708
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:45,871
<i>and you're my brother too.</i>

709
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,254
<i>All of the soldiers in the 7th Company</i>

710
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:56,465
<i>are my brothers.</i>

711
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:00,928
<i>My brother died protecting his comrades.</i>

712
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:03,263
<i>If I were him,</i>

713
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,599
<i>I would do the same thing.</i>

714
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:23,867
<i>Thank you.</i>

715
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,911
<i>Brother.</i>

716
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:33,502
<i>Wanli.</i>

717
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:34,962
<i>Wanli.</i>

718
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,051
Commander.

719
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:45,889
<i>What?</i>

720
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:47,766
<i>I...</i>

721
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:50,853
<i>Well...</i>

722
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,647
<i>What I told you before</i>

723
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,357
<i>might not...</i>

724
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,693
<i>might not all be correct.</i>

725
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,446

<i>You care about me.</i>

729
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:14,918
<i>I didn't let you run around before</i>

730
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,420
<i>as you might cause trouble.</i>

731
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:18,714
<i>But now,</i>

00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:21,884
<i>run as you wish</i>

733
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:23,427
<i>and fly</i>

734
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,388
<i>as you like.</i>

735
00:54:45,324 --> 00:54:46,867
<i>Do it fast.</i>

736
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,328
<i>Throw the grenades</i>

737
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,915
<i>as far as possible.</i>

738
00:55:33,288 --> 00:55:34,873
<i>That's our motherland.</i>

739
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,890
<i>Long live the People's Republic of China.</i>

<i>Look,</i>

744
00:57:12,179 --> 00:57:13,931
<i>is that a radio CV?</i>

745
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:16,725
<i>Yes.</i>

746
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:18,727
<i>The radio CV</i>

747
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,896
<i>should be very close to the HQ.</i>

748
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,608
<i>The lights are on</i>

749
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:25,692
<i>in all five blockhouses.</i>

750
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:28,028
<i>Only one of the houses is not lit-up</i>

751
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,697
<i>with a sniper staying on guard.</i>

752
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,368

00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,281
<i>Looks like a trap.</i>

760
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,168
<i>The south fort armed with heavy firepower</i>

761
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,504
<i>must be there to protect the bridge.</i>

762
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:29,548

01:09:26,037 --> 01:09:27,413
<i>Zhong Dingyi, blast the north gate.</i>

912
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:28,039
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

913
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:58,444
<i>Zhong Dingyi.</i>

914
01:10:26,472 --> 01:10:27,306
<i>Yu,</i>

915
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:29,100
<i>He Changgui didn't attack from the north side.</i>

916
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,268
<i>There must be a reason.</i>

917
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:31,394
<i>I'll go down to find their HQ.</i>

918
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:32,937
<i>You guys go take down the key point.</i>

919
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:33,938
<i>Especially you!</i>

920
01:10:33,938 --> 01:10:34,856
<i>Don't be reckless.</i>

921
01:10:34,981 --> 01:10:35,690
<i>I'll behave.</i>

922
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:36,983
<i>Tell us before you go anywhere.</i>

923
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:37,817
<i>Okay-</i>

924
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,052
<i>Alert! South Fort under attack!</i>

925
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:06,387
<i>Enemy at 12 o'clock!</i>

926
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:07,430
<i>Ammo loaded.</i>

927
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,514
<i>Ready to fire!</i>

928
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:15,021
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

929
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:37,794
<i>Target engaged.</i>

930
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,253
<i>Fire!</i>

931
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,640
<i>Enemy contact! Get into positions!</i>

932
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,434
<i>That was our command headquarters, you idiot!</i>

933
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:54,560
<i>They got us!</i>

934
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,229
<i>They blew our HQ!</i>

935
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:04,570
<i>Leave now!</i>

936
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:06,155
<i>Fire in the hole, 30 seconds!</i>

937
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:06,906
<i>Move!</i>

938
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:10,076
<i>Clear out now! Move, move, move!</i>

939
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:14,247
<i>Hurry up! Move!</i>

940
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:18,793
<i>Everybody, run! Run!</i>

941
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:19,585
<i>We are attacked!</i>

942
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:21,045
<i>We are unarmed!</i>

943
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:22,129
<i>Don't shoot!</i>

944
01:12:22,505 --> 01:12:23,881
<i>Who's your commander? Step forward!</i>

945
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,384
<i>He doesn't understand! You don't see?</i>

946
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:27,677
<i>We are unarmed!</i>

947
01:12:27,677 --> 01:12:28,261
<i>Bomb!</i>

948
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:29,804
<i>- Where's your commander?
- Bomb!</i>

949
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,390
<i>I'm asking you. Where's your commander?</i>

950
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,642
<i>Let's go! Come on!</i>

951
01:13:34,869 --> 01:13:36,037
<i>Seize the second floor.</i>

952
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:55,932
<i>Take down that wall.</i>

953
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:57,141
<i>So we can get to the surface of the bridge.</i>

954
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:03,731
<i>Here's the blind spot.</i>

955
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,399
<i>Need to go over there.</i>

956
01:14:32,635 --> 01:14:33,552
<i>- Yang Wenjian.
- Present!</i>

957
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,262
<i>Can you discern their firepower deployment?</i>

958
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:36,806
<i>One M9 Bazooka.</i>

959
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,641
<i>One recoilless rifle.</i>

960
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:40,267
<i>Two mortars.</i>

961
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:44,522
<i>That is to say</i>

962
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:46,315
<i>there's a ten-meter space between each fire point.</i>

963
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:47,608
<i>That should be where</i>

964
01:14:47,775 --> 01:14:49,026
<i>they keep their ammunition.</i>

965
01:14:50,611 --> 01:14:51,362
<i>Use semaphores!</i>

966
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:52,196
<i>Fire on both sides!</i>

967
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:52,905
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

968
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:56,117
<i>(Semaphore: Attention!)</i>

969
01:14:57,576 --> 01:14:58,911
<i>(Semaphore: Attack forward!)</i>

970
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:00,579
<i>(Semaphore: Against both sides!)</i>

971
01:15:00,579 --> 01:15:01,497
<i>(Semaphore: Over.)</i>

972
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,665
<i>15 degrees from the muzzle.</i>

973
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:04,166
<i>140 meters.</i>

974
01:15:05,710 --> 01:15:06,460
<i>Yang Wenjian.</i>

975
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:07,044
<i>Here!</i>

976
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:07,962
<i>Take this!</i>

977
01:15:08,838 --> 01:15:09,880
<i>Watch for me!</i>

978
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:12,341
<i>Watch very carefully!</i>

979
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:13,134
<i>Okay-</i>

980
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:17,221
<i>Fire!</i>

981
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:20,433
<i>Incoming!</i>

982
01:15:26,272 --> 01:15:27,898
<i>Supplies got hit!</i>

983
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:33,612
<i>Right on target.</i>

984
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:34,155
<i>Co!</i>

985
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,073
<i>Cross their line of fire!</i>

986
01:15:36,407 --> 01:15:37,158
<i>Take me along!</i>

987
01:15:37,283 --> 01:15:38,034
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

988
01:15:38,617 --> 01:15:39,702

<i>Cover for the commando for attack!</i>

990
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:43,539
<i>Full force!</i>

991
01:15:43,748 --> 01:15:45,291
<i>Reset position!</i>

992
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:47,501
<i>- Urgent supply refill!
- Yes, sir!</i>

993
01:15:47,501 --> 01:15:48,252
<i>Move, move, move!</i>

994
01:15:48,878 --> 01:15:49,920
<i>Open fire!</i>

<i>Over.</i>

1031
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:05,467
<i>It's a tank!</i>

1032
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,810
<i>They are pulling out the tank.</i>

1033
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:15,936
<i>What are we waiting for?</i>

1034
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:17,438
<i>I can't stand it anymore.</i>

1035
01:20:24,778 --> 01:20:26,196
<i>Out of the heavy weapons we seized</i>

1036
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:27,948
<i>we only have a recoilless rifle.</i>

1037
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:30,117
<i>And these ammunition left.</i>

1038
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:32,619
<i>It's all written in English.</i>

1039
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:34,538

<i>All-out assault now.</i>

1045
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:26,215
<i>We'll wait for the commander's signal.</i>

1046
01:21:27,341 --> 01:21:28,634
<i>It's a signal to attack.</i>

1047
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:30,094
<i>Destroy the tank.</i>

1048
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:36,392

Let go!

1055
01:22:39,872 --> 01:22:40,956
<i>Are you alright?</i>

1056
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:45,878
<i>Qianli, get down!</i>

1057
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:47,212
<i>What the hell!</i>

1058
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:48,881
<i>There's a grenade in my shirt.</i>

1059
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:50,174
<i>Let me get it out!</i>

1060
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:52,134
<i>Or we are all going to hell!</i>

1061
01:23:15,032 --> 01:23:15,908
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1062
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:19,828
<i>Qianli.</i>

1063
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:22,206
<i>Yu Congrong was shot up there.</i>

1064
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:24,041
<i>Let's go now.</i>

1065
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:34,301
Dammit.

1066
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:37,888
<i>Their commanders wear these types of caps.</i>

1067
01:23:44,311 --> 01:23:45,145
<i>He is</i>

1068
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,397
<i>the comannder we want to capture.</i>

<i>Destroy it!</i>

1074
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,616
<i>How are He Changgui and others doing?</i>

1075
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:43,287
<i>They're pinned</i>

1076
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:44,621
<i>by heavy firepower.</i>

1077
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:46,123
<i>They can't even lift their heads.</i>

1078
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,127
<i>Cover me with the cannon!</i>

1079
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:52,212
<i>Fire!</i>

1080
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,065
<i>Here! Get ready!</i>

1081
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:52,105
<i>He Changgui occupied the north side.</i>

1082
01:25:52,731 --> 01:25:54,232
<i>Clear the fire points on the roof!</i>

1083
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:56,420
<i>Yu Congfflng!</i>

1084
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:59,005
<i>Yu Congfflng!</i>

<i>Wake up!</i>

1087
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:03,510
<i>I'm okay, commander.</i>

1088
01:27:03,802 --> 01:27:05,011
<i>That helmet saved me.</i>

1089
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:08,849
<i>Retreat!</i>

1090
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:15,814
<i>Get on, fire!</i>

1091
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:22,446
<i>Go! Notify Ping He to blast the bridge!</i>

1092
01:27:29,453 --> 01:27:30,871
<i>They didn't take down the tank on the north side.</i>

1093
01:27:39,129 --> 01:27:40,464
<i>The tank is on the bridge now.</i>

1094
01:27:40,881 --> 01:27:42,424
<i>It'll block our bursts.</i>

1095
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:45,427
<i>Wait for the signal!</i>

1096
01:27:47,763 --> 01:27:49,598
<i>Shoot it with recoilless rifle!</i>

1097
01:27:50,056 --> 01:27:51,308
<i>The bracket is broken.</i>

1098
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:54,561
<i>Load it!</i>

1099
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,565
<i>Ready for aiming!</i>

1100
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:00,609
<i>Ready!</i>

1101
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:01,985
<i>Fire!</i>

1102
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,076
<i>Did we hit the target?</i>

1103
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:11,203
<i>Yes!</i>

1104
01:28:12,078 --> 01:28:13,121
<i>I can't read the foreign label.</i>

1105
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:15,165
<i>We loaded in smoke shell instead.</i>

1106
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:20,796
<i>Move the gun ahead!</i>

1107
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:21,421
<i>Hurry!</i>

1108
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:23,131
<i>Hit it with a different shell!</i>

1109
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:32,682
<i>Forget about the signal.</i>

1110
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:34,184
<i>Get ready to blast the wall.</i>

1111
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:35,519
<i>This is the last shot.</i>

1112
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:38,897
<i>Hit the roof with suppressive fire!</i>

1113
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:40,398
<i>Cover us!</i>

1114
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:18,395
<i>If we go out now,</i>

1115
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,981
<i>we'll be within the range of their tank.</i>

1116
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:26,236
<i>If we don't destroy the tank,</i>

1117
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:27,946
<i>we can't blast the bridge.</i>

1118
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,155
<i>It's loaded.</i>

1119
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:32,576
<i>We'll put the dynamite under the tank</i>

1120
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:35,203
<i>and blow up the tank too!</i>

1121
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:45,589
<i>We can't hang on much longer!</i>

1122
01:29:45,589 --> 01:29:47,090
<i>Need to find a way out.</i>

1123
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:54,556
<i>You two go to the south of the Pump House.</i>

1124
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,182
<i>I'll find a way to go in.</i>

1125
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:57,434
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

1126
01:29:58,560 --> 01:29:59,269
<i>Co!</i>

1127
01:30:16,286 --> 01:30:17,203
<i>It stopped.</i>

1128
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:20,206
<i>Proceed with the mission!</i>

1129
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:21,207
<i>Got it!</i>

1130
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:38,266
<i>Commander!</i>

1131
01:30:39,351 --> 01:30:40,268
<i>Ping He!</i>

1132
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:41,478
<i>How are you doing over there?</i>

1133
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:42,938
<i>Commander!</i>

1134
01:30:43,104 --> 01:30:44,230
<i>We can blast the bridge now!</i>

1135
01:30:44,814 --> 01:30:45,941
<i>Carry out the mission!</i>

1136
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:47,901
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

1137
01:30:51,821 --> 01:30:53,198
<i>I'll put this under your tank.</i>

1138
01:30:56,201 --> 01:31:03,208
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...</i>

1139
01:32:16,281 --> 01:32:18,116
<i>Ping He, are you okay?</i>

1140
01:32:18,116 --> 01:32:19,075
<i>Commander,</i>

1141
01:32:19,909 --> 01:32:20,952
<i>I'm okay.</i>

1142
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:24,122
<i>Yu Congrong will come to
your aid on the south side.</i>

1143
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:25,248
<i>Proceed to blast the bridge.</i>

1144
01:33:42,325 --> 01:33:45,578
<i>Fire!</i>

1145
01:35:38,441 --> 01:35:39,484
<i>We did it.</i>

1146
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,030
<i>We successfully accomplished our mission.</i>

1147
01:35:45,907 --> 01:35:47,283
<i>Where are Ping He and others?</i>

1148
01:35:56,209 --> 01:35:58,127
<i>7th Regiment, Sumun Command.</i>

1149
01:35:59,879 --> 01:36:01,589
<i>Reinforce are positive.</i>

1150
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,549
<i>Ready for counterattack.</i>

1151
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:05,677
<i>I repeat.</i>

1152
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:07,720
<i>Reinforce are positive.</i>

1153
01:36:08,137 --> 01:36:10,014
<i>Ready for counterattack, over.</i>

1154
01:36:19,565 --> 01:36:20,733
<i>Ammunition.</i>

1155
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:21,651
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1156
01:36:21,985 --> 01:36:23,152
<i>3rd Squad, come here.</i>

1157
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,321
<i>Set up the gun</i>

1158
01:36:25,655 --> 01:36:27,115
<i>and knock down their commanding point!</i>

1159
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:28,032
<i>Set up the gun.</i>

1160
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:34,414
<i>It's aimed.</i>

1161
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:36,165
<i>Fire!</i>

1162
01:36:48,094 --> 01:36:49,762
<i>Commander, it's from our cannon.</i>

1163
01:36:51,014 --> 01:36:51,723
<i>Let's go.</i>

1164
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:14,912
<i>Where are our men in the Pump House?</i>

1165
01:37:28,634 --> 01:37:30,053
<i>Check the North of the bridge.</i>

1166
01:37:30,053 --> 01:37:31,888
<i>See if anyone is hiding in the pits</i>

1167
01:37:32,138 --> 01:37:32,847
<i>or playing dead.</i>

1168
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:34,182
<i>Seize some useful supplies.</i>

1169
01:37:34,349 --> 01:37:35,308
<i>Take whatever you can carry.</i>

1170
01:37:35,308 --> 01:37:35,850
<i>Let's go.</i>

1171
01:37:51,157 --> 01:37:52,075
<i>Take cover!</i>

1172
01:37:52,075 --> 01:37:53,159
<i>Commander!</i>

1173
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:05,922
<i>U.S. tanks!</i>

1174
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:20,812
<i>Sir,</i>

1175
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:22,230
<i>the bridge is under attack!</i>

1176
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:23,439
<i>Bridge flag is down.</i>

1177
01:38:23,564 --> 01:38:24,982
<i>No radio response!</i>

1178
01:38:28,277 --> 01:38:29,612
<i>Attack with full force!</i>

1179
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:30,446
<i>Tanks,</i>

1180
01:38:30,446 --> 01:38:31,364
<i>open fire!</i>

1181
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:32,949
<i>Open fire!</i>

1182
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:04,981
<i>It's the commander's signal for retreat.</i>

1183
01:39:06,441 --> 01:39:07,817
<i>The enemy's reinforcements arrived.</i>

1184
01:39:08,067 --> 01:39:09,318
<i>But we can't see how many there are.</i>

1185
01:39:13,865 --> 01:39:15,199
<i>Retreat!</i>

1186
01:39:15,324 --> 01:39:16,909
<i>Notify everyone of full Company retreat.</i>

1187
01:39:26,335 --> 01:39:27,211
<i>Commander,</i>

1188
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:28,337

<i>Did you hear me?</i>

1210
01:40:34,195 --> 01:40:35,029
<i>Retreat!</i>

1211
01:40:38,824 --> 01:40:39,700
<i>Let's go!</i>

1212
01:40:39,909 --> 01:40:40,785
<i>Get down there.</i>

<i>Commander!</i>

1217
01:40:58,219 --> 01:40:59,595
<i>I told you to retreat.</i>

1218
01:40:59,971 --> 01:41:01,430
<i>Why did you come over?</i>

1219
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:02,640
<i>Stop yelling.</i>

1220
01:41:02,765 --> 01:41:03,683
<i>Save your breath.</i>

1221
01:41:03,933 --> 01:41:04,725
<i>We're already here.</i>

1222
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:06,394
<i>Where are the others?</i>

1223
01:41:06,811 --> 01:41:08,145
<i>Everyone has retreated.</i>

1224
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:18,364
<i>Where's Ping He?</i>

1225
01:41:22,660 --> 01:41:24,245
<i>He has already fulfilled his mission.</i>

1226
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:52,667
<i>The radio transmitter is working.</i>

1227
01:43:32,039 --> 01:43:33,666
<i>818</i>

1228
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:48,139
<i>Getting into position.</i>

<i>Ready to proceed.</i>

1230
01:44:02,278 --> 01:44:03,821
<i>Wake up! Enemy planes!</i>

<i>Get up! Get up!</i>

1237
01:44:14,457 --> 01:44:16,333
<i>9th Company, have you seen Yu Congrong?</i>

1238
01:44:16,459 --> 01:44:17,668
<i>He was just right here.</i>

1239
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:28,888
<i>Quick, lean against the mountain!</i>

1240
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:34,894
<i>8 incendiaries should take care of it.</i>

<i>Enemy detected.</i>

1250
01:46:03,482 --> 01:46:05,693
<i>Shouldn't be just one man out there.</i>

1251
01:46:05,693 --> 01:46:07,278
<i>Let's burn these rats out.</i>

1252

<i>Don't shoot!</i>

1259
01:48:23,998 --> 01:48:25,290
<i>That should do it.</i>

1260
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:26,583
<i>Let's get back to base.</i>

1261
01:48:27,209 --> 01:48:28,252

<i>I'm here.</i>

1274
01:49:38,155 --> 01:49:40,407
<i>Attention, all engineers.</i>

1275
01:49:40,574 --> 01:49:42,117
<i>H1C:</i>

1276
01:49:42,117 --> 01:49:45,370
<i>You have 3 hours to repair the bridge.</i>

1277
01:49:45,996 --> 01:49:51,043
<i>Consolidate C1, B3 sections. South side.</i>

1278
01:49:52,252 --> 01:49:53,462
<i>All units.</i>

1279
01:49:53,462 --> 01:49:56,215
<i>Condition 1 in operation.</i>

1280
01:49:56,548 --> 01:49:58,008
<i>Stay on point.</i>

1281
01:49:58,926 --> 01:50:00,052
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

1282
01:50:00,385 --> 01:50:02,971
<i>If those bastards had gotten a yard closer,</i>

1283
01:50:03,180 --> 01:50:05,349
<i>this bridge would have been toasted!</i>

1284
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,810
<i>You think we gonna make it out of here, Scotty?</i>

1285
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:08,769
<i>I hope so.</i>

1286
01:50:08,769 --> 01:50:10,938
<i>God knows how many of them are coming next time.</i>

1287
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:12,314
Gee.

1288
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:15,400
<i>Gonna be another 3 days till our boys are cleared.</i>

1289
01:50:15,567 --> 01:50:18,779
<i>That's 10,000 of our guys
that we gotta watch out for.</i>

1290
01:50:19,947 --> 01:50:21,657
<i>You know, Smith said this is not a retreat.</i>

1291
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:24,368
<i>We're just advancing in another direction.</i>

1292
01:50:25,077 --> 01:50:26,078
<i>That's considerate.</i>

1293
01:50:26,078 --> 01:50:28,080
<i>Better than advancing into hell I guess.</i>

1294
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:31,792
<i>Sir, we've patched up the
north side over there with wood.</i>

1295
01:50:31,792 --> 01:50:33,836
<i>But it still needs some reinforcement.</i>

1296
01:50:34,044 --> 01:50:36,213
<i>And that's a problem because
we are all out of steel.</i>

1297
01:50:36,380 --> 01:50:39,216
<i>And we still need to fix that pipe over there too.</i>

1298
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:40,509
<i>Make it happen.</i>

1299
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:43,303
<i>Send another request to HQ.</i>

1300
01:50:43,512 --> 01:50:46,723
<i>And get me more firepower around this bridge.</i>

1301
01:50:47,015 --> 01:50:48,392
<i>If they blow it one more time,</i>

1302
01:50:48,392 --> 01:50:50,352
<i>we'll be up shit's creek without a paddle.</i>

1303
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:51,520
<i>Yes sir.</i>

1304
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:52,729
<i>Hurried up, guys!</i>

1305
01:51:42,446 --> 01:51:44,364
<i>Latest news from the front.</i>

1306
01:51:44,448 --> 01:51:47,451
<i>The Sumun Bridge,
the army"s main route for rear advance</i>

1307
01:51:47,576 --> 01:51:50,537
<i>has come under attack for a second time.</i>

1308
01:51:50,787 --> 01:51:54,416
<i>The 1st marine division is facing a major test.</i>

1309
01:52:09,431 --> 01:52:10,140
<i>General,</i>

1310
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:12,809
<i>the main structure at the
Sumun bridge has been damaged.</i>

1311
01:52:13,227 --> 01:52:16,146
<i>If the bridge gets hit again, it may be unusable.</i>

1312
01:52:17,356 --> 01:52:18,273
<i>Damn Smith,</i>

1313
01:52:18,273 --> 01:52:20,025
<i>I told him not to retreat.</i>

1314
01:52:20,567 --> 01:52:23,070
<i>Doesn't he know he could face a court martial?</i>

1315
01:52:25,656 --> 01:52:26,949
<i>What's the UN's reaction</i>

1316
01:52:27,032 --> 01:52:28,450
<i>to the A bomb plan?</i>

1317
01:52:28,659 --> 01:52:30,744
<i>It engendered controversy, sir.</i>

1318
01:52:36,375 --> 01:52:40,629
<i>Contact all factories cooperating
with our military in Tokyo.</i>

1319
01:52:41,129 --> 01:52:43,840
<i>Make sure to get that damn bridge fixed.</i>

1320
01:52:44,383 --> 01:52:45,509
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1321
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:51,306
<i>Yang Wenjian, where did you get that vehicle?</i>

1322
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:53,100
<i>This half-track was seized</i>

1323
01:52:53,558 --> 01:52:55,269
<i>by the commander at Koto-ri.</i>

1324
01:52:55,894 --> 01:52:57,479
<i>The weapon on the top is not working.</i>

1325
01:52:57,896 --> 01:52:59,147
<i>But it can still move.</i>

1326
01:53:15,622 --> 01:53:17,249
<i>No matter how many times they fix the bridge,</i>

1327
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,167
<i>we will blast it</i>

1328
01:53:19,584 --> 01:53:20,752
<i>every time they fix it.</i>

1329
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:23,255
<i>As long as the bridge is there,</i>

1330
01:53:23,922 --> 01:53:25,757
<i>our mission still stands.</i>

1331
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:34,516
<i>I said,</i>

1332
01:53:35,267 --> 01:53:36,351
<i>we would win</i>

1333
01:53:37,102 --> 01:53:38,645
<i>and take them home.</i>

1334
01:53:55,162 --> 01:53:56,872
<i>My wife said,</i>

1335
01:53:56,997 --> 01:53:58,623
<i>when I go home again,</i>

1336
01:53:59,041 --> 01:54:02,669
<i>I must teach math to my daughter.</i>

1337
01:54:05,797 --> 01:54:06,965
<i>Let's say goodbye here.</i>

1338
01:54:24,232 --> 01:54:25,567
<i>Come back alive.</i>

1339
01:56:22,559 --> 01:56:23,310
<i>Wanli,</i>

1340
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:24,769
<i>your mission</i>

1341
01:56:25,103 --> 01:56:26,688
<i>is to blow the whistle in every 3 hours</i>

1342
01:56:27,147 --> 01:56:28,940
<i>at different locations</i>

1343
01:56:29,149 --> 01:56:31,109
<i>on the south or north side of the bridge</i>

1344
01:56:31,318 --> 01:56:32,694
<i>so as to distract the U.S. Army.</i>

1345
01:56:34,446 --> 01:56:36,156
<i>The rest of the 9th Company and I</i>

1346
01:56:36,406 --> 01:56:37,782
<i>will do our best</i>

1347
01:56:37,782 --> 01:56:39,284
<i>to draw firepower onto us.</i>

1348
01:56:39,868 --> 01:56:40,827
<i>So that Qianli</i>

1349
01:56:40,952 --> 01:56:42,829
<i>will have 10 more seconds for his mission.</i>

1350
01:56:43,497 --> 01:56:44,206
<i>Remember,</i>

1351
01:56:44,539 --> 01:56:46,500
<i>you must do your best to survive</i>

1352
01:56:46,791 --> 01:56:48,293
<i>and accurately report the situation here</i>

1353
01:56:48,293 --> 01:56:51,254
<i>to OUI' reinforcements.</i>

1354
01:56:51,755 --> 01:56:52,506
<i>Stay alert!</i>

1355
01:56:52,506 --> 01:56:53,715
— <i>What was that?</i>
— <i>Get up!</i>

1356
01:57:29,125 --> 01:57:30,752
<i>Let's keep everyone awake.</i>

1357
01:57:30,961 --> 01:57:32,254
<i>And get them some coffee.</i>

1358
01:57:32,254 --> 01:57:33,046
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

1359
01:57:51,523 --> 01:57:52,399
<i>Stvp it!</i>

1360
01:57:52,524 --> 01:57:53,358
<i>There is no one there!</i>

1361
01:57:53,358 --> 01:57:54,150
<i>What are you shooting at?</i>

1362
01:58:05,579 --> 01:58:07,080
<i>Music, lieutenant!</i>

1363
01:58:07,163 --> 01:58:08,081
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

1364
01:58:21,803 --> 01:58:23,346
<i>Now that's more like it.</i>

1365
01:58:25,557 --> 01:58:26,600
<i>What was that?</i>

1366
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:29,269
<i>Come on, you never heard of this song before?</i>

1367
01:58:29,561 --> 01:58:33,815
<i>I'm gonna buy a paper doll...</i>

1368
01:58:33,815 --> 01:58:34,691
<i>What a classic.</i>

1369
01:58:39,696 --> 01:58:43,533
<i>Can't believe I'm hearing this song
in this shithole.</i>

1370
01:58:43,783 --> 01:58:45,035
<i>Who are they kidding.</i>

1371
02:01:06,342 --> 02:01:07,594
<i>Reload!</i>

1372
02:01:09,471 --> 02:01:10,930
<i>Target truck!</i>

1373
02:01:17,812 --> 02:01:19,355
<i>Open fire!</i>

1374
02:01:46,132 --> 02:01:48,134
<i>Enemy truck coming down the hill!</i>

1375
02:01:48,927 --> 02:01:49,969
<i>Take cover!</i>

1376
02:02:06,778 --> 02:02:08,071
<i>195115!</i>

1377
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:27,632
<i>What the hell!</i>

1378
02:02:50,572 --> 02:02:51,781
<i>Hold.</i>

1379
02:02:58,538 --> 02:03:00,957
<i>I don't like the look of this, sir.</i>

1380
02:03:01,416 --> 02:03:02,250
<i>Wait.</i>

1381
02:03:03,042 --> 02:03:04,669
<i>Let's keep him alive.</i>

1382
02:03:05,169 --> 02:03:07,171
<i>It'll be more exciting for us.</i>

1383
02:03:07,797 --> 02:03:11,843
<i>Anybody know the word "surrender" in his language?</i>

1384
02:03:12,802 --> 02:03:13,970
<i>No, sir.</i>

1385
02:03:29,068 --> 02:03:33,114
<i>Fire!</i>

1386
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:42,707
<i>The U.S. army we are going to face</i>

1387
02:03:42,832 --> 02:03:46,044
<i>has the best equipment in the world.</i>

1388
02:03:48,087 --> 02:03:49,005
<i>This battle</i>

1389
02:03:49,589 --> 02:03:51,174
<i>will be extremely arduous.</i>

1390
02:03:51,466 --> 02:03:52,675
<i>But we need to strive for victory.</i>

1391
02:04:30,421 --> 02:04:31,381
<i>Qianli.</i>

1392
02:04:51,359 --> 02:04:52,110
<i>Qianli.</i>

1393
02:05:41,451 --> 02:05:42,785
<i>I didn't let you run around before</i>

1394
02:05:42,910 --> 02:05:44,245
<i>as you might cause trouble.</i>

1395
02:05:46,039 --> 02:05:47,373
<i>But now,</i>

1396
02:05:48,041 --> 02:05:49,584
<i>run as you wish</i>

1397
02:05:50,168 --> 02:05:51,586
<i>and fly</i>

1398
02:05:52,003 --> 02:05:53,296
<i>as you like.</i>

1399
02:08:30,870 --> 02:08:34,165
<i>Sir, there are no more enemies below the bridge.</i>

1400
02:08:34,165 --> 02:08:35,625
<i>Should I keep burning?</i>

1401
02:08:36,417 --> 02:08:37,752
<i>No, soldier.</i>

1402
02:08:38,211 --> 02:08:39,754
<i>We've burnt them enough.</i>

1403
02:08:39,754 --> 02:08:41,339
<i>It's time we go home.</i>

1404
02:08:41,464 --> 02:08:42,757
<i>Sir, yes, sir!</i>

1405
02:09:45,653 --> 02:09:49,323
<i>This is AFNK, bringing you the
latest news from the Front.</i>

1406
02:09:49,532 --> 02:09:51,575
<i>After 10 long days of battle,</i>

1407
02:09:51,575 --> 02:09:53,953
<i>more than 14,000 American troops</i>

1408
02:09:53,953 --> 02:09:57,331
<i>found themselves trapped on the Koto-ri Plateau.</i>

1409
02:09:57,331 --> 02:10:00,042
<i>Their only safe escape, the Sumun Bridge</i>

1410
02:10:00,042 --> 02:10:02,461
<i>had been destroyed in a fire fight.</i>

1411
02:10:02,753 --> 02:10:05,172
<i>The Far East Combat Cargo Command</i>

1412
02:10:05,172 --> 02:10:09,802
<i>dispatched a request to HQ in Tokyo
for emergency support.</i>

1413
02:10:10,094 --> 02:10:12,305
<i>At 9 a.m. on December 7th,</i>

<i>8 Air Force C-119 flying boxcars</i>

1415
02:10:15,516 --> 02:10:17,310
<i>appeared over Koto-ri.</i>

02:10:17,310 --> 02:10:21,397
<i>Secured to each aircraft is
a section of M-2 bridge.</i>

1417
02:10:21,397 --> 02:10:24,567
<i>Each weighing nearly 2,500 pounds!</i>

1418
02:10:24,567 --> 02:10:28,112
<i>In fact, the innovative strategy
to repair the bridge</i>

1419
02:10:28,112 --> 02:10:30,614
<i>was the first of its kind in history.</i>

1420
02:10:30,823 --> 02:10:32,366
<i>Good work, boys!</i>

1421
02:10:32,533 --> 02:10:35,494
<i>This is Can as Richards, signing off.</i>

1422
02:11:01,020 --> 02:11:02,521
<i>What are you looking at, sir?</i>

1423
02:11:04,106 --> 02:11:06,442
<i>Could be a warning sign, soldier.</i>

1424
02:11:11,072 --> 02:11:13,866
<i>It's telling us
we don't have much time to pull out.</i>

1425
02:11:15,117 --> 02:11:16,827
<i>We really need to think this through.</i>

1426
02:11:18,496 --> 02:11:20,414
<i>It's gonna be a tough war, soldier.</i>

1427
02:11:22,166 --> 02:11:24,627
<i>We have to remember what happened here.</i>

1428
02:12:32,862 --> 02:12:35,030
<i>Time to go home, buddy.</i>

1429
02:13:12,193 --> 02:13:14,278
<i>Rest in peace, boys.</i>

1430
02:13:14,862 --> 02:13:16,530
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

1431
02:13:18,824 --> 02:13:20,284

<i>Commander, he is one of us.</i>

1437
02:14:10,751 --> 02:14:12,086
<i>I think he's from the 7th Company.</i>

1438
02:14:12,294 --> 02:14:13,295
<i>Where are the rest of them?</i>

1439
02:17:16,061 --> 02:17:16,812
<i>Commander!</i>
