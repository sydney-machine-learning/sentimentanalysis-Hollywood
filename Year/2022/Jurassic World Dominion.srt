1
00:01:01,684 --> 00:01:03,120
Bring it in!

2
00:01:25,608 --> 00:01:27,910
<i>Dinosaurs are in our world.</i>

3
00:01:27,945 --> 00:01:29,912
<i>And with every confrontation,</i>
<i>we learn more</i>

4
00:01:29,947 --> 00:01:31,914
<i>about this frightening</i>
<i>new reality.</i>

5
00:01:34,684 --> 00:01:36,253
<i>How did we get here?</i>

6
00:01:36,286 --> 00:01:37,820
Oh, my God.

7
00:01:37,854 --> 00:01:39,555
<i>It's been three decades</i>

8
00:01:39,589 --> 00:01:41,557
<i>since the deadly events</i>
<i>at Jurassic Park,</i>

9
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:43,593
<i>and we've yet to find a way</i>
<i>for these animals</i>

10
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:45,595
<i>to live safely among us.</i>

11
00:01:45,628 --> 00:01:46,863
<i>After the devastating eruption</i>

12
00:01:46,896 --> 00:01:49,066
<i>of Isla Nublar's</i>
<i>long-dormant volcano,</i>

13
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:52,635
<i>those who survived were</i>
<i>transported to the mainland.</i>

14
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:55,305
Many of the larger predators
were captured,

15
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:57,740
but the remaining creatures
scattered here

16
00:01:57,774 --> 00:02:00,210
in Big Rock National Park.

17
00:02:00,244 --> 00:02:02,246
While most remained in the wild,

18
00:02:02,279 --> 00:02:03,981
<i>those who made their way</i>
<i>to civilization</i>

19
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:06,316
<i>struggled to adapt</i>
<i>to unfamiliar conditions.</i>

20
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,354
<i>Local authorities have warned</i>
<i>the animals are unpredictable</i>

21
00:02:10,387 --> 00:02:13,623
<i>and, when hungry,</i>
<i>extremely violent.</i>

22
00:02:13,656 --> 00:02:16,193
<i>As the dinosaurs spread</i>
<i>across borders,</i>

23
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:18,328
<i>-a global black market has</i>
<i>risen.</i> -They're not ours.

24
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:21,165
Go on, you sad, pathetic loser!

25
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:24,101
<i>To combat the growing</i>
<i>threat of illegal poachers,</i>

26
00:02:24,134 --> 00:02:26,769
<i>the U.S. Congress awarded</i>
<i>sole collection rights</i>

27
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:29,973
<i>to the global giant</i>
<i>Biosyn Genetics.</i>

28
00:02:30,007 --> 00:02:32,775
At Biosyn, we're dedicated
to the idea

29
00:02:32,809 --> 00:02:36,879
that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves.

30
00:02:36,913 --> 00:02:40,750
<i>CEO Lewis Dodgson</i>
<i>has created a sanctuary</i>

31
00:02:40,783 --> 00:02:43,686
<i>in Italy's Dolomite Mountains,</i>
<i>where he hopes to study</i>

32
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:45,922
<i>the dinosaurs'</i>
<i>ancient immune systems</i>

33
00:02:45,956 --> 00:02:48,092
<i>for unique</i>
<i>pharmaceutical properties.</i>

34
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,060
<i>While Biosyn believes</i>
<i>we can handle</i>

35
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:53,230
<i>genetic power responsibly,</i>
<i>the public remains skeptical.</i>

36
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:56,033
<i>Some note that these</i>
<i>government contracts have led</i>

37
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:59,303
to massive spikes
in Biosyn's profits.

38
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:01,838
And rumors persist
of a human clone

39
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:05,675
who mysteriously disappeared,
leading to a worldwide search.

40
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,777
<i>Some believe she's</i>
<i>genetically identical</i>

41
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,846
<i>to Charlotte Lockwood,</i>
<i>deceased daughter</i>

42
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,950
<i>of Jurassic Park cofounder</i>
<i>Benjamin Lockwood.</i>

43
00:03:12,983 --> 00:03:16,153
<i>Now that we've brought these</i>
<i>animals back from extinction...</i>

44
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:20,857
<i>Are we responsible for them?</i>

45
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,926
<i>Or should they be left</i>
<i>to fend for themselves?</i>

46
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,130
<i>As we adapt to</i>
<i>an ever-changing world,</i>

47
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:28,831
<i>we must find answers</i>
<i>to these questions--</i>

48
00:03:28,865 --> 00:03:32,069
<i>for their safety</i>
<i>as well as for our own.</i>

49
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:16,879
We are inside
the illegal breeding facility.

50
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:21,084
The juveniles are kept in cages
to keep costs down.

51
00:04:21,118 --> 00:04:23,320
It's medieval.

52
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:28,824
Claire.

53
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,232
Why do you think
he's separated from the rest?

54
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:39,902
I don't think
he's gonna make it.

55
00:04:44,308 --> 00:04:46,210
No. What are you doing?

56
00:04:46,243 --> 00:04:47,411
We can report this.

57
00:04:47,444 --> 00:04:50,147
The DFW takes days
to investigate.

58
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,482
We can save this one now.

59
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:55,252
It's okay. It's okay, buddy.

60
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,123
Okay. Here we go.

61
00:05:04,428 --> 00:05:06,496
Nope. No!

62
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,831
Lift.

63
00:05:08,864 --> 00:05:11,001
-Support the head.
-Yeah.

64
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:12,169
Okay. Yeah.

65
00:05:16,406 --> 00:05:18,108
Okay, come on.
Come on, let's go.

66
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:25,182
-Hold on.
-To what?

67
00:05:49,006 --> 00:05:51,408
Claire, we're gonna get shot!

68
00:05:56,846 --> 00:05:58,881
-No. Claire, no! No, Claire!
-Oh, no!

69
00:06:08,858 --> 00:06:10,060
Oh, shit.

70
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,897
Everybody good?

71
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:16,933
No!

72
00:06:27,444 --> 00:06:30,514
Okay. Okay, so I think
we get this one to the DFW,

73
00:06:30,547 --> 00:06:32,215
and then we hit them again.

74
00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:35,118
Yeah. Yeah, you saw
that breeding ground, right?

75
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:36,953
We're done.

76
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:40,190
I got a call last week.

77
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:41,291
It's a real job.

78
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:43,893
Something I could do
to effectively change things.

79
00:06:43,927 --> 00:06:46,029
-I got to take it.
-They need us.

80
00:06:46,063 --> 00:06:48,332
Are you saving these dinosaurs
because they need us,

81
00:06:48,365 --> 00:06:50,334
or are you saying them
to absolve yourself?

82
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,935
Claire.

83
00:06:51,968 --> 00:06:54,171
I mean, this is crazy. We...

84
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:55,572
Claire.

85
00:06:55,605 --> 00:06:57,274
You're doing the right thing.

86
00:06:57,307 --> 00:07:00,444
But this... this isn't the way
to go about it anymore.

87
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:03,347
Honestly, you need someone

88
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,082
who's good at being shot at.

89
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:08,385
Aren't-aren't you and Owen
still, like, a weird thing?

90
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:09,953
It's not that weird.

91
00:07:09,986 --> 00:07:12,489
-He didn't mean weird. No.
-Mm-mm.

92
00:07:12,522 --> 00:07:15,125
Uh, he meant, like, surprising.

93
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:37,013
Hyah!

94
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,266
Let's bring 'em home! Hyah!

95
00:08:17,354 --> 00:08:19,389
Hyah!

96
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:47,350
No.

97
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:01,465
Okay. Come here.

98
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:07,204
Okay.

99
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:22,052
We're gonna get you
someplace safe.

100
00:09:25,388 --> 00:09:27,123
Hey.

101
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,097
There you go. There you go.

102
00:09:34,798 --> 00:09:36,333
Yeah.

103
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:35,178
Hey.

104
00:12:36,846 --> 00:12:38,682
Where you been?

105
00:12:38,715 --> 00:12:39,816
Nowhere.

106
00:12:39,849 --> 00:12:42,285
What are you burning?

107
00:12:42,318 --> 00:12:45,689
Oh, nothing.
Just some old blankets.

108
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,292
You sure you didn't
go past the bridge?

109
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:51,294
That's the look you give me
when you think I'm lying.

110
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,430
-Well, are you?
-No.

111
00:12:53,463 --> 00:12:55,498
Maisie, you're literally
looking everywhere but here.

112
00:12:55,532 --> 00:12:58,002
I said I didn't
go past the bridge.

113
00:13:01,871 --> 00:13:03,506
Maisie.

114
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,742
-Can we start over?
-I know, Claire.

115
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:07,711
There are people out there
who'll do anything to find me.

116
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:09,379
I'm not angry.

117
00:13:09,412 --> 00:13:11,247
So that means
you don't have to be angry.

118
00:13:11,281 --> 00:13:12,782
I'm not angry.

119
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:14,350
I can take care of myself.

120
00:13:14,384 --> 00:13:15,986
Hey.

121
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,621
It's okay for us
to depend on each other.

122
00:13:18,655 --> 00:13:20,457
That's what people do.

123
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,559
How would I know what people do?

124
00:13:22,592 --> 00:13:25,528
The only people I've spoken to
in the past four years

125
00:13:25,562 --> 00:13:27,597
are you both.

126
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,767
Besides, I'm not even
a real person anyway.

127
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,801
What?

128
00:13:31,835 --> 00:13:34,004
I was made from someone else.

129
00:13:34,038 --> 00:13:36,606
I'm not me.

130
00:13:43,413 --> 00:13:46,382
You're the only you
who ever was.

131
00:13:47,617 --> 00:13:48,818
What?

132
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:50,420
No.

133
00:13:50,453 --> 00:13:51,956
Was that, like, really corny?

134
00:13:51,989 --> 00:13:53,289
It was so corny.

135
00:13:53,323 --> 00:13:54,657
Can we keep that between us?

136
00:13:54,691 --> 00:13:55,993
Can't promise that.

137
00:14:02,766 --> 00:14:04,034
-Hey, kid.
-Hi.

138
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:05,702
Sorry I'm late.

139
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:07,004
Bop, bop.

140
00:14:08,538 --> 00:14:09,405
Aw.

141
00:14:09,439 --> 00:14:10,840
You smell like horses.

142
00:14:10,874 --> 00:14:11,976
Mm.

143
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:13,443
Oh, you like that, do you?

144
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:14,744
-I do, yeah.
-Aw.

145
00:14:14,778 --> 00:14:15,812
Okay.

146
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:17,447
Um...

147
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,050
I'm gonna... make dinner.

148
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:21,918
Everything okay?

149
00:14:23,386 --> 00:14:25,555
She went into town again.

150
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:28,424
This kid.

151
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:30,527
Did you talk to her?

152
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,395
I tried.

153
00:14:33,863 --> 00:14:35,398
I'll talk to her.

154
00:16:14,731 --> 00:16:16,133
All right.

155
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:18,768
Cut away from yourself.

156
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:23,974
Whoa.

157
00:16:24,008 --> 00:16:25,109
Whew.

158
00:16:25,142 --> 00:16:27,177
-Stone-cold.
-Right?

159
00:16:27,211 --> 00:16:29,013
I would not mess with her.

160
00:16:29,046 --> 00:16:30,813
No way.

161
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,887
Listen, kiddo,
we should probably talk

162
00:16:37,921 --> 00:16:38,989
about you going into town.

163
00:16:40,157 --> 00:16:41,524
I don't think you understand

164
00:16:41,557 --> 00:16:42,825
how bad it is
being trapped here.

165
00:16:42,859 --> 00:16:44,460
You're not trapped here.

166
00:16:44,494 --> 00:16:45,930
We just don't trust people.

167
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,497
No, you just don't trust me.

168
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,832
And then you expect me
to trust you.

169
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:52,669
-Why can't I have any freedom?
-Because you can't.

170
00:16:57,573 --> 00:16:59,809
That went great.

171
00:16:59,842 --> 00:17:01,577
What is happening?

172
00:17:02,179 --> 00:17:04,181
-She's 14.
-Yeah.

173
00:17:04,214 --> 00:17:06,549
You remember what that was like.

174
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:08,953
I do.

175
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,956
We can't keep her here forever.

176
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,623
If we don't figure this out,

177
00:17:13,656 --> 00:17:15,558
she's gonna go a lot farther
than the bridge.

178
00:17:15,591 --> 00:17:17,261
If they find her, we're never
gonna see her again.

179
00:17:17,294 --> 00:17:18,963
We got to protect her.
That's our job.

180
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,197
That's what we're gonna do.

181
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,966
Protect her how?

182
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,001
By locking her inside?

183
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:27,537
<i>She's got questions.</i>

184
00:17:28,238 --> 00:17:30,506
<i>You know,</i>
<i>questions we can't answer.</i>

185
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:34,044
<i>She wants to know who she is.</i>

186
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:39,882
<i>Who Charlotte Lockwood was.</i>

187
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,789
Tracked Grady to his house.

188
00:17:46,823 --> 00:17:51,095
You were right--
the raptor's got a juvenile.

189
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,630
But listen,
there's something else.

190
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:57,767
I found that girl
you've been after.

191
00:18:12,149 --> 00:18:13,850
Here you go.

192
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,623
Thanks for coming.

193
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:29,960
Wasn't sure who to call.

194
00:19:29,993 --> 00:19:32,029
Fish and Wildlife
didn't even want to see it

195
00:19:32,062 --> 00:19:33,397
if it wasn't a dinosaur.

196
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,698
Yeah, well,
they get all the attention.

197
00:19:35,731 --> 00:19:37,367
You guys want to vary
the sampling plots

198
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:38,835
a hundred yards each?

199
00:19:38,868 --> 00:19:41,271
-These your students?
-Yeah.

200
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,872
We've been looking
into the impact

201
00:19:42,905 --> 00:19:45,109
of industrial farming
on the environment,

202
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,377
so this is right up our alley.

203
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:50,280
They hit 60 fields
in the county.

204
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,316
Have you seen anything
like this before?

205
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:54,284
No. Not like this.

206
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:57,720
They've been leaving degraded
fields all across the Midwest.

207
00:19:57,753 --> 00:20:01,125
First, these big companies
try to kill off all the insects.

208
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,093
Now this.

209
00:20:13,137 --> 00:20:14,404
Is that your land?

210
00:20:14,438 --> 00:20:15,872
That's the Bennetts' corn.

211
00:20:15,905 --> 00:20:17,141
The locusts didn't eat that.

212
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,909
You plant the same seed
as the Bennetts?

213
00:20:19,943 --> 00:20:21,345
No.

214
00:20:21,378 --> 00:20:23,646
We are independent.

215
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:26,816
They use Biosyn seed.

216
00:20:28,784 --> 00:20:30,887
Yeah, I bet they do.

217
00:20:31,787 --> 00:20:33,756
You say you caught a live one?

218
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,668
Okay. Let her down slow.

219
00:20:46,503 --> 00:20:49,973
-Got it?
-Yeah. Easy.

220
00:20:56,313 --> 00:20:58,048
Why do we dig?

221
00:20:58,081 --> 00:21:01,318
'Cause paleontology is science,

222
00:21:01,351 --> 00:21:03,920
and science is about the truth,

223
00:21:03,954 --> 00:21:06,123
and there is truth
in these rocks.

224
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:07,690
Grant!

225
00:21:09,792 --> 00:21:11,328
You're gonna want to see this.

226
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:25,275
Ellie Sattler.

227
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,811
Alan Grant.

228
00:21:28,844 --> 00:21:30,514
You look the same.

229
00:21:30,547 --> 00:21:32,516
Oh.

230
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:35,885
And this place--it's so...

231
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,956
...so, uh, you.

232
00:21:40,324 --> 00:21:41,959
I'm sorry, I...

233
00:21:41,992 --> 00:21:44,194
If I'd known you were coming,
I would've...

234
00:21:46,163 --> 00:21:47,197
Uh...

235
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:52,069
Can I get you something?
A beer or...

236
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:55,239
Um, well, maybe not
at 10:00 a.m.

237
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,140
But iced tea or...

238
00:21:57,174 --> 00:21:58,542
Tea. Yeah.

239
00:21:58,575 --> 00:22:00,210
Tea. I can do that.

240
00:22:01,578 --> 00:22:04,014
Saw a lot of tourists
on the way in.

241
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,150
Well, the funding's dried up,
so...

242
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:09,119
somebody's got to pay
for all this.

243
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,754
Right. Thank you.

244
00:22:13,056 --> 00:22:15,492
I read your articles
about soil science

245
00:22:15,525 --> 00:22:17,194
and regenerative farming.

246
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:19,129
-It was great.
-Thanks.

247
00:22:19,162 --> 00:22:21,797
Gave me grounds for some hope,
for a change.

248
00:22:21,831 --> 00:22:23,200
How are your kids?

249
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,102
Mm.

250
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,869
Amazing. Grown.

251
00:22:26,902 --> 00:22:28,871
It's shocking.
They're both in college.

252
00:22:28,904 --> 00:22:30,340
Can you believe that?

253
00:22:30,374 --> 00:22:32,075
And Mark?

254
00:22:33,843 --> 00:22:36,046
It's over.

255
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:38,015
Oh.

256
00:22:38,949 --> 00:22:40,816
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

257
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:42,352
It's okay.

258
00:22:42,386 --> 00:22:44,087
I'm back to me.

259
00:22:44,121 --> 00:22:45,155
My work.

260
00:22:45,188 --> 00:22:47,357
-You know, it's...
-That's great.

261
00:22:47,391 --> 00:22:49,159
It's good. It is.

262
00:22:49,192 --> 00:22:50,460
I'm alone at last.

263
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,995
Exciting times.

264
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:54,564
Yeah, I'm living
the Alan Grant life.

265
00:22:54,598 --> 00:22:56,400
-It's just...
-Can be lonely.

266
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:58,101
...so free.

267
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,339
Ellie...

268
00:23:03,407 --> 00:23:08,045
You didn't come out all this way
just to catch up, now, did you?

269
00:23:11,548 --> 00:23:13,450
Well, it's a locust.

270
00:23:13,483 --> 00:23:16,586
Mandibles, wings, thorax, but...

271
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,888
God, the size of it is massive.

272
00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:23,493
It has genes that have been
extinct since the Cretaceous,

273
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,629
and swarms of them
are decimating crops

274
00:23:25,662 --> 00:23:27,397
from Iowa to Texas.

275
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:29,433
Terrifying, right?

276
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,035
Started as a few hundred.

277
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:34,204
There could be millions
by the end of the summer.

278
00:23:34,237 --> 00:23:35,871
If they keep going,

279
00:23:35,905 --> 00:23:38,542
there will be no grain
to feed chickens, cattle.

280
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:40,610
The entire food chain
would collapse.

281
00:23:40,644 --> 00:23:45,248
Well, it's clearly designed,
but why would anyone do that?

282
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:50,220
None of the crops they're eating
are Biosyn seed.

283
00:23:50,253 --> 00:23:51,887
Biosyn.

284
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:53,423
You're saying Biosyn made this.

285
00:23:53,457 --> 00:23:55,258
I mean, it would not shock me

286
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:57,893
that they want to control
the world's food supply.

287
00:23:57,928 --> 00:24:00,364
Not before a few million starve.

288
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,932
Yeah, what is that saying?

289
00:24:01,965 --> 00:24:04,468
Uh, we're three meals away
from anarchy?

290
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:08,472
If we don't stop them, you can
pick your last three meals.

291
00:24:09,973 --> 00:24:12,008
So why are you
bringing it to me?

292
00:24:12,042 --> 00:24:13,677
I need concrete evidence

293
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,946
Biosyn's responsible
for all this.

294
00:24:15,979 --> 00:24:17,581
I need to go to their sanctuary

295
00:24:17,614 --> 00:24:20,283
and get DNA
from another locust there.

296
00:24:21,551 --> 00:24:24,321
But I need a witness.

297
00:24:24,354 --> 00:24:25,489
Alan.

298
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,625
You command respect.
People believe you.

299
00:24:28,658 --> 00:24:30,660
Ellie.

300
00:24:30,694 --> 00:24:32,596
You know why I'm here?
It's quiet.

301
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:34,131
I'm done with all that.

302
00:24:34,164 --> 00:24:36,299
Are you? Okay.

303
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,034
Well, I'm sorry, Alan.

304
00:24:38,068 --> 00:24:40,203
Nobody gets that luxury anymore.

305
00:24:40,237 --> 00:24:41,605
Not even you.

306
00:24:41,638 --> 00:24:43,607
And you know what?

307
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,409
You're the one I trust.

308
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,550
This Biosyn sanctuary is what,
a hundred miles from anywhere?

309
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,285
How do you even get in there?

310
00:24:55,318 --> 00:24:56,653
I got an invite.

311
00:24:56,686 --> 00:24:59,156
From their in-house philosopher.

312
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,191
Seems there's a lot of money

313
00:25:01,224 --> 00:25:03,226
in being a chaotician
these days.

314
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,963
And he just happened to invite
you out of the blue, huh?

315
00:25:07,697 --> 00:25:09,366
He said there were things
I'd want to see.

316
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:10,500
Uh-huh.

317
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,108
You coming or what?

318
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:34,357
Every animal captured
on the mainland

319
00:25:34,391 --> 00:25:36,026
comes through here
before shipping out

320
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:37,260
to Biosyn's sanctuary
in the Dolomites.

321
00:25:37,294 --> 00:25:39,129
We give them medical attention

322
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,431
and make sure
they leave healthy.

323
00:25:41,465 --> 00:25:43,467
So much security.

324
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,101
Those are just the ones you see.

325
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:47,504
A lot of shady types out there
want these guys.

326
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,641
Your plane's just fueling up.

327
00:25:52,642 --> 00:25:55,245
Biosyn's a tough invite.
You guys must know somebody.

328
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:57,414
-Do you mind if I...?
-Of course.

329
00:25:59,216 --> 00:26:00,717
Hello.

330
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,352
You see me?

331
00:26:02,385 --> 00:26:03,620
Follow me.

332
00:26:03,653 --> 00:26:05,355
We rescued these guys

333
00:26:05,388 --> 00:26:07,491
from an illegal breeding farm
in Nevada a few weeks ago.

334
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,659
Shut the whole place down.

335
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:11,094
Anonymous tip.

336
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:12,629
Good girl.

337
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:14,798
Yes. Yes.

338
00:26:14,831 --> 00:26:16,766
Alan.

339
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:19,202
You never get used to it.

340
00:26:19,803 --> 00:26:21,638
-Take care.
-Thank you.

341
00:26:21,671 --> 00:26:23,406
-Bye.
-Okay.

342
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,844
Hey.

343
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:05,081
You look just like Blue.

344
00:27:07,784 --> 00:27:09,753
This?

345
00:27:09,786 --> 00:27:12,122
You want to try it?

346
00:27:12,722 --> 00:27:14,190
Okay.

347
00:27:22,332 --> 00:27:23,600
Huh.

348
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,606
Maisie, don't move.

349
00:27:33,476 --> 00:27:34,578
Hey, girl.

350
00:27:35,645 --> 00:27:36,813
Staying out of trouble?

351
00:27:36,846 --> 00:27:39,416
She had a baby.
That's impossible.

352
00:27:41,718 --> 00:27:43,153
Back up.

353
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:44,854
She won't hurt us, right?

354
00:27:44,888 --> 00:27:46,590
Oh, you're damn right she will.

355
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,158
Just breathe.

356
00:27:48,191 --> 00:27:49,826
If you don't,
she'll think you're scared.

357
00:27:49,859 --> 00:27:51,494
I am scared.

358
00:27:51,528 --> 00:27:54,531
Nah. She doesn't
need to know that.

359
00:28:01,404 --> 00:28:03,273
Her nest has got to be nearby.

360
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,609
-Maisie, get inside.
-I'm coming with you.

361
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,210
What did I just say?

362
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,921
We got to move.

363
00:28:17,955 --> 00:28:19,723
Not yet. We need the girl.

364
00:28:21,791 --> 00:28:22,892
Hey, what's up?

365
00:28:22,926 --> 00:28:24,394
Oh.

366
00:28:27,263 --> 00:28:30,400
Maisie? Maisie.

367
00:28:34,204 --> 00:28:36,506
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

368
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:37,574
Where are you going?

369
00:28:37,607 --> 00:28:38,742
You can't keep me here.

370
00:28:38,775 --> 00:28:40,276
You're not my mother.

371
00:28:45,815 --> 00:28:48,418
She's leaving the house.

372
00:29:14,844 --> 00:29:16,646
-Tie it down!
-Come on, let's go.

373
00:29:21,618 --> 00:29:23,687
Let's get out of here!

374
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:44,207
Who are you?

375
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:06,730
Claire!

376
00:30:07,697 --> 00:30:09,365
-They found her.
-What?

377
00:30:09,399 --> 00:30:10,867
-Who are they?
-Poachers.

378
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,435
I've seen 'em around.

379
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:13,770
Leader's a real shit heel.

380
00:30:13,803 --> 00:30:16,539
He must have recognized me,
followed me here.

381
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:18,341
-Where is she?
-Go get the truck.

382
00:30:18,374 --> 00:30:20,243
Oh, my God.

383
00:30:22,712 --> 00:30:24,347
Oh, God.

384
00:30:26,016 --> 00:30:28,018
Owen.

385
00:30:28,052 --> 00:30:29,919
Hey. No.

386
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,725
They took her kid, too.

387
00:30:39,696 --> 00:30:41,966
I am gonna get her back.

388
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:43,833
I promise you that.

389
00:30:53,944 --> 00:30:55,378
Come on.

390
00:30:55,411 --> 00:30:57,014
I know who to call.

391
00:31:11,761 --> 00:31:14,531
No! Please, please! No, no!

392
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:17,600
This year, man. What's next?

393
00:31:17,634 --> 00:31:21,071
Historically, uh, darkness,
blood, rain of fire.

394
00:31:21,105 --> 00:31:22,639
I think frogs.

395
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:24,440
We're not gonna be around
for much longer anyway.

396
00:31:24,474 --> 00:31:25,976
These locusts in Nebraska
are about to wrap it up.

397
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,577
They're eating the corn, wheat.

398
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:29,546
Basically all of our food
and our food's food.

399
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:31,949
So we can say goodbye to this.

400
00:31:34,751 --> 00:31:36,954
-Hello?
-Franklin, it's me.

401
00:31:36,987 --> 00:31:38,421
-You at work?
-Okay.

402
00:31:38,454 --> 00:31:40,423
You're kind of a subject
of interest around here,

403
00:31:40,456 --> 00:31:42,026
so I can't really
be talking to you.

404
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:43,359
Come on, I'm in trouble.

405
00:31:43,393 --> 00:31:44,627
I really need your help, please.

406
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:46,429
Yeah, and I could lose my job,

407
00:31:46,462 --> 00:31:47,965
and you know I'm not qualified
to do anything else.

408
00:31:47,998 --> 00:31:49,465
We're outside.

409
00:31:51,668 --> 00:31:53,436
Let me talk to him.

410
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,841
That him?

411
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,109
That's him.

412
00:31:59,143 --> 00:32:01,444
Name's Rainn Delacourt.

413
00:32:01,477 --> 00:32:03,013
Real piece of work.

414
00:32:03,047 --> 00:32:04,614
What'd he take?

415
00:32:05,481 --> 00:32:07,784
Something we care about
very much.

416
00:32:07,817 --> 00:32:09,552
Oh, shit.

417
00:32:09,586 --> 00:32:11,454
I told you somebody
would come looking for her.

418
00:32:11,487 --> 00:32:13,157
You can't just take
a person, Claire.

419
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:15,558
-I had no choice.
-Not in the eyes of the law.

420
00:32:15,592 --> 00:32:18,561
This guy is not the law.
Tell us how to find him.

421
00:32:19,964 --> 00:32:21,798
Where'd you guys call me from?

422
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,902
We have a man on the inside
of Delacourt's operation.

423
00:32:25,936 --> 00:32:27,137
There's an exchange in Malta

424
00:32:27,171 --> 00:32:28,738
sometime tomorrow--
cash for cargo.

425
00:32:28,771 --> 00:32:30,040
Was she with him?

426
00:32:31,342 --> 00:32:34,178
There's no mention, but we have
people on the ground already.

427
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:35,612
One of 'em you know.

428
00:32:35,645 --> 00:32:37,014
A lot of us got recruited
by the CIA

429
00:32:37,047 --> 00:32:38,615
after the park went down.

430
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,784
Barry's French intelligence now.

431
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,022
I need to talk to him.

432
00:32:45,055 --> 00:32:47,024
You can't just call him.
He's deep cover.

433
00:32:47,057 --> 00:32:48,791
Look, once we make
the bust in Malta,

434
00:32:48,825 --> 00:32:51,161
our guys will see if Delacourt
knows where she is.

435
00:32:51,195 --> 00:32:53,030
Our guys.

436
00:32:53,063 --> 00:32:54,497
Not you.

437
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,500
Promise me you won't go in there
with your vest

438
00:32:57,533 --> 00:32:59,402
and mess everything up.

439
00:33:00,037 --> 00:33:01,537
Why would I do that?

440
00:33:02,538 --> 00:33:05,742
Look, you guys
are both crazy, but...

441
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,543
you seem like
you're good parents

442
00:33:07,577 --> 00:33:09,213
or whatever you're trying to be.

443
00:33:09,246 --> 00:33:11,648
She's lucky to have you.

444
00:33:12,882 --> 00:33:15,485
Don't get killed, okay?

445
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:35,105
Think we're almost there.

446
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,706
Yeah.

447
00:33:50,087 --> 00:33:51,854
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant.

448
00:33:51,888 --> 00:33:53,890
-Ramsay Cole, communications.
-Oh, hey.

449
00:33:53,923 --> 00:33:55,125
Uh, I have to warn you,

450
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,726
everyone's so excited
to have you.

451
00:33:56,759 --> 00:33:58,996
You guys are absolute legends
around here.

452
00:33:59,029 --> 00:34:01,831
Mm, you must be confusing us
with somebody else.

453
00:34:01,864 --> 00:34:02,933
You know, it's great

454
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:05,069
that you guys are still
so close with Dr. Malcolm.

455
00:34:05,102 --> 00:34:08,005
I mean, sometimes you meet your
heroes and they disappoint you,

456
00:34:08,038 --> 00:34:10,506
but he's exactly the way
you'd want him to be.

457
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,741
I mean,
such motility of thought.

458
00:34:11,774 --> 00:34:13,110
-It's incredible.
-Yeah.

459
00:34:13,143 --> 00:34:14,777
How much time
have you spent with him?

460
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:17,547
Uh, well,
I know that was sarcastic,

461
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,915
but honestly, not enough.

462
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:20,017
Oh, please, after you.

463
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,251
-Oh.
-And watch your head.

464
00:34:28,292 --> 00:34:30,626
So, Biosyn bought this
land for the amber deposits

465
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,595
back in the '90s,
but we've managed to turn it

466
00:34:32,628 --> 00:34:34,932
into a safe haven
for about 20 displaced species.

467
00:34:34,965 --> 00:34:36,934
First generation came
from Sorna.

468
00:34:36,967 --> 00:34:38,936
Most of the Nublar dinosaurs
are here, too.

469
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:42,039
Took Fish and Wildlife
three years to catch the T. rex.

470
00:34:42,072 --> 00:34:44,607
-The...
-The T. rex is here?

471
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,977
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

472
00:34:47,011 --> 00:34:50,047
Arrived just before you guys.

473
00:35:06,696 --> 00:35:09,632
Aerial deterrent system active.

474
00:35:09,665 --> 00:35:12,635
Restricted airspace
protects the airborne life.

475
00:35:12,668 --> 00:35:14,972
Keeps the pterosaurs
below 500 feet.

476
00:35:15,005 --> 00:35:16,539
Airborne?

477
00:35:18,108 --> 00:35:20,177
Is that <i>Dreadnoughtus?</i>

478
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:21,945
What?

479
00:35:29,086 --> 00:35:30,753
Beautiful, right?

480
00:35:30,787 --> 00:35:32,789
The name means "fear nothing."

481
00:35:32,822 --> 00:35:35,192
Well, I guess you know that.

482
00:35:35,225 --> 00:35:36,360
What do they graze on?

483
00:35:36,393 --> 00:35:37,727
Hawthorn and fern.

484
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,296
All indigenous--nothing stocked

485
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:41,031
except for the deer population.

486
00:35:41,065 --> 00:35:44,334
It's a great mezzanine species
for the apex predator.

487
00:35:44,368 --> 00:35:46,336
-Oh...
-Apex predator?

488
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,972
<i>Giganotosaurus.</i>

489
00:35:49,006 --> 00:35:51,075
At least for now.

490
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,387
Uh, you don't let people
in there, right?

491
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,822
Uh, no, our-our research...

492
00:36:05,855 --> 00:36:07,723
Our research outposts
are connected

493
00:36:07,757 --> 00:36:08,825
completely underground.

494
00:36:08,858 --> 00:36:10,360
If we have to, we can just

495
00:36:10,394 --> 00:36:13,696
herd the animals remotely
using a neuro-implant

496
00:36:13,729 --> 00:36:15,966
that sends electrical signals
directly to the brain.

497
00:36:15,999 --> 00:36:17,334
Like shocks?

498
00:36:17,367 --> 00:36:20,170
Uh, n-no, li-like signals.

499
00:36:20,204 --> 00:36:23,307
Doesn't it strike you
as a little bit, uh...

500
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,841
-Cruel?
-Cruel.

501
00:36:24,874 --> 00:36:26,376
Do you know how much voltage

502
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:29,146
was in the electric fences
at Jurassic Park?

503
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,081
Yeah.

504
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,022
Please join
Dr. Ian Malcolm at noon

505
00:36:39,056 --> 00:36:42,059
in the lecture hall for
"The Ethics of Genetic Power."

506
00:36:42,092 --> 00:36:43,860
God, everyone's so young.

507
00:36:43,893 --> 00:36:45,661
Oh, well, it is part
of our ethos

508
00:36:45,695 --> 00:36:47,364
to attract the best
and brightest.

509
00:36:47,397 --> 00:36:49,133
Doctors.

510
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:53,237
Respected, renowned
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant.

511
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,372
Hi. I'm... Wow, this is big.

512
00:36:55,405 --> 00:36:57,773
-I'm-I'm Lewis.
-Dodgson. Yeah.

513
00:36:57,807 --> 00:36:59,176
-Hi.
-You're Lewis Dodgson?

514
00:36:59,209 --> 00:37:00,444
I am. How do you do?

515
00:37:00,477 --> 00:37:02,745
We didn't expect
to actually see you here.

516
00:37:02,778 --> 00:37:03,913
Oh, well, I wouldn't be
anywhere else.

517
00:37:03,947 --> 00:37:06,150
-Would you?
-No.

518
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:08,885
I mean, the people you see here
are changing the world.

519
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:10,287
Would you mind if we, um...

520
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,022
-Uh...
-Oh.

521
00:37:12,055 --> 00:37:14,024
Just to...
It would mean a lot. If...

522
00:37:14,057 --> 00:37:15,459
Do you want to, um...

523
00:37:15,492 --> 00:37:17,227
-Oh, great. Thank you so much.
-Oh, uh...

524
00:37:18,495 --> 00:37:20,164
Th-That's good.
That's good. Thanks.

525
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:24,867
So, you are going to see
some remarkable things today.

526
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:28,405
We are unlocking
the true power of the genome.

527
00:37:28,438 --> 00:37:30,174
We're this close. Believe me.

528
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:32,109
You'll make a fortune with that.

529
00:37:32,142 --> 00:37:34,178
No, it's not about money.

530
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:35,778
No, we've already identified

531
00:37:35,811 --> 00:37:37,214
dozens of applications
for paleo-DNA.

532
00:37:37,247 --> 00:37:41,218
We're talking about cancer,
Alzheimer's, autoimmune.

533
00:37:41,251 --> 00:37:42,986
We will be saving lives, but...

534
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,787
I bet.

535
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,191
Um, anyway, I wish I could
take you around myself,

536
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:48,925
but, uh, it's, uh...

537
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:52,229
So, you're in more-than-capable
hands with Ramsay.

538
00:37:52,262 --> 00:37:55,332
He's basically a... a young me,

539
00:37:55,365 --> 00:37:58,901
only smarter and, uh, taller...

540
00:37:58,936 --> 00:38:01,804
Do you have food?

541
00:38:01,837 --> 00:38:04,107
-Like, one of my bars?
-Pardon? Um...

542
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:06,510
No, never mind.
Uh, uh, I'll find something.

543
00:38:06,543 --> 00:38:08,744
So, uh, I want to do
more of this,

544
00:38:08,778 --> 00:38:10,880
um, later on if we, um...

545
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,915
Oh, we booked you a private pod

546
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,750
-for the trip out, so...
-Right.

547
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,986
It's beautiful. You'll love it.

548
00:38:16,019 --> 00:38:17,487
Through the caverns
and everything.

549
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:19,022
Uh, you better hurry.
Malcolm's on.

550
00:38:19,056 --> 00:38:21,325
He's a bit of a contrarian,
but I like him.

551
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:22,758
He keeps us on our toes.

552
00:38:22,792 --> 00:38:23,961
Anyway...

553
00:38:23,994 --> 00:38:26,129
Thank you for being here.
It's...

554
00:38:28,365 --> 00:38:31,001
Okay, um, follow me, please.

555
00:38:32,502 --> 00:38:34,104
What?

556
00:38:34,137 --> 00:38:39,509
Human beings have no more right
to safety or liberty

557
00:38:39,543 --> 00:38:42,980
than any other creature
on this planet.

558
00:38:44,414 --> 00:38:49,253
We not only lack dominion
over nature,

559
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,288
we're subordinate to it.

560
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:53,991
And now here we are

561
00:38:54,024 --> 00:38:57,294
with the opportunity to
rewrite life at our fingertips.

562
00:38:57,327 --> 00:39:00,397
And just like nuclear power,
nobody knew what to expect

563
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:04,201
with genetic engineering,
but they pressed the button

564
00:39:04,234 --> 00:39:07,070
and hoped for the best...

565
00:39:07,104 --> 00:39:10,007
just like you are doing now.

566
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:13,210
Yep. You.

567
00:39:14,344 --> 00:39:19,915
You control the future
of our survival on planet Earth.

568
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,885
According to you,
the solution is genetic power.

569
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:26,290
But that same power could
devastate the food supply,

570
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:28,558
create new diseases,

571
00:39:28,592 --> 00:39:30,926
alter the climate even further.

572
00:39:30,961 --> 00:39:34,864
Unforeseen consequences occur.

573
00:39:34,897 --> 00:39:40,203
And every time,
every single time...

574
00:39:41,638 --> 00:39:43,906
...we all act surprised?

575
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,876
Because deep down,
I don't think that any of us

576
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:50,080
actually believe
that these dangers are real.

577
00:39:57,354 --> 00:40:01,058
In order to instigate
revolutionary change,

578
00:40:01,091 --> 00:40:07,197
we must transform
human consciousness.

579
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:15,972
-Mayam?
-Mm-hmm.

580
00:40:16,006 --> 00:40:17,641
-Dr. Malcolm?
-Very good.

581
00:40:17,674 --> 00:40:19,276
There-there you go.

582
00:40:19,309 --> 00:40:21,311
Hey, I don't want to be rude
to my friends. Thank you.

583
00:40:21,345 --> 00:40:23,613
Catch me on my way out.
Thanks, everybody.

584
00:40:23,647 --> 00:40:25,082
Look at you,

585
00:40:25,115 --> 00:40:29,019
and look at me, and look at you.

586
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,886
Wow, this is so trippy.

587
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,989
You look like you're doing well.

588
00:40:33,023 --> 00:40:34,358
Well, I got five kids, you know,

589
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,493
whom I adore
more than life itself, so...

590
00:40:36,526 --> 00:40:38,061
uh, expenses add up.

591
00:40:38,095 --> 00:40:40,497
You, Alan? Are you... are you...

592
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:42,566
You have any family or...?

593
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:43,600
No.

594
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:46,069
So, uh, I need to talk to you.

595
00:40:46,103 --> 00:40:47,637
Yeah, I need to talk
to you, too.

596
00:40:47,671 --> 00:40:50,140
-Privately.
-Do you two talk a lot?

597
00:40:50,173 --> 00:40:52,275
-Uh, he slid into my DMs.
-He did what?

598
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:54,578
-It's urgent, Ian.
-What did you do?

599
00:40:54,611 --> 00:40:56,279
"Seven minutes to midnight"
stuff.

600
00:40:56,313 --> 00:40:58,682
Uh, the Doomsday Clock
might be about out of time,

601
00:40:58,715 --> 00:41:01,518
but as they say,
it's always darkest

602
00:41:01,551 --> 00:41:04,321
just before eternal nothingness.

603
00:41:04,354 --> 00:41:05,989
What?

604
00:41:07,524 --> 00:41:10,994
Locusts,
altered with Cretaceous-era DNA.

605
00:41:11,027 --> 00:41:12,329
Yeah, that's not my field.

606
00:41:12,362 --> 00:41:14,364
Yeah, but if these things
continue to multiply,

607
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:17,401
we're talking about cascading
system-wide effects, Ian.

608
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:19,035
Gosh, that's a drag.

609
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:21,104
What is the matter with you?

610
00:41:21,138 --> 00:41:23,073
Why? Is there something special
you want me to do?

611
00:41:23,106 --> 00:41:24,274
Yeah, how about give a damn?

612
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:25,976
You know far too much
not to care.

613
00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:29,413
Hey, I-I gave my opinion
robustly for years.

614
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:31,415
As expected,
the sum of our human endeavors

615
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:34,684
has led to our annihilation,
and the only play now

616
00:41:34,718 --> 00:41:37,354
is to take the time
that we have left and, uh,

617
00:41:37,387 --> 00:41:39,689
you know, just like
we always do, squander it.

618
00:41:39,723 --> 00:41:42,959
Honestly, Ian, that's bullshit.

619
00:41:42,993 --> 00:41:45,128
Can I offer you guys some joe?

620
00:41:45,162 --> 00:41:49,032
Uh, Tyler, please,
two cappuccinos.

621
00:41:49,065 --> 00:41:50,534
I don't want a cappuccino.

622
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:52,335
Uh, well, I could do, like,
a cortado or, like, macchiato.

623
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:54,438
Trust me, it's real tough,
that jet lag.

624
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:55,572
It's gonna perk you right up.

625
00:41:59,609 --> 00:42:01,745
The locusts are part
of a larger project

626
00:42:01,778 --> 00:42:03,580
called Hexapod Allies.

627
00:42:03,613 --> 00:42:05,115
You're right about their intent.

628
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,384
I started hearing rumors
six weeks ago.

629
00:42:07,417 --> 00:42:09,719
I read your piece on decadence
and put two and two together.

630
00:42:09,753 --> 00:42:11,354
I was not raising my voice.

631
00:42:11,388 --> 00:42:13,056
You're beginning to.
It's crescendoing, isn't it?

632
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:14,591
They're proliferating wildly.

633
00:42:14,624 --> 00:42:16,760
They're lasting three, four
times longer than they should.

634
00:42:16,793 --> 00:42:19,129
And all my models
are pointing toward a global

635
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,697
ecological collapse, Ian.

636
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,332
Downstairs, sublevel six.

637
00:42:22,365 --> 00:42:24,468
That's where they keep
the locusts.

638
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:26,369
Look for a lab marked L4.

639
00:42:26,403 --> 00:42:28,271
But wait, how are we ever
gonna get down there?

640
00:42:28,305 --> 00:42:30,073
Hey, this looks so silky.

641
00:42:30,106 --> 00:42:31,708
May I touch this blouse,
by any chance?

642
00:42:31,741 --> 00:42:33,343
-Sure.
-You know what it is?

643
00:42:33,376 --> 00:42:35,145
-Don't tell... Don't tell me.
-You won't know it.

644
00:42:35,178 --> 00:42:37,180
This is sustainable bamboo.

645
00:42:37,214 --> 00:42:39,149
-It is sustainable bamboo.
-That's why I said it.

646
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,550
-How did you know that?
-I just know it.

647
00:42:40,584 --> 00:42:42,219
-Yeah, it's amazing.
-I've got cumin.

648
00:42:42,252 --> 00:42:43,553
-It's very amazing.
-I've got cinnamon.

649
00:42:43,587 --> 00:42:45,255
I've got allspice,
which is not very popular.

650
00:42:45,288 --> 00:42:46,756
-I've got five-spice.
-Doctor.

651
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,091
Um, if you're into
that kind of feel.

652
00:42:48,124 --> 00:42:51,027
-Um, and let's talk milks.
-Yeah.

653
00:42:51,061 --> 00:42:53,096
Okay. Soy milk, yes?

654
00:42:54,431 --> 00:42:57,033
-No.
-What just happened?

655
00:42:57,067 --> 00:42:59,002
We're in.

656
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:15,285
Sublevel six. Restricted.

657
00:43:21,157 --> 00:43:23,760
Lewis,
you're not listening to me.

658
00:43:23,793 --> 00:43:25,762
The locusts' prehistoric DNA
has made them

659
00:43:25,795 --> 00:43:27,531
stronger than they should be.

660
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:30,300
They're multiplying like crazy,
and they're not dying.

661
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:31,801
What part of this
don't you understand?

662
00:43:31,835 --> 00:43:33,203
Oh, I do understand.

663
00:43:33,236 --> 00:43:35,105
This is gonna be
a global famine.

664
00:43:35,138 --> 00:43:36,806
Hey, hey, we can't
anticipate everything.

665
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:39,543
We need to eradicate
the ones we released.

666
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:41,278
-What?
-All of them.

667
00:43:41,311 --> 00:43:43,580
-No. No. Henry.
-Like... like, yesterday.

668
00:43:43,613 --> 00:43:45,348
We don't want to cause a panic.

669
00:43:45,382 --> 00:43:46,816
We want control.

670
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:49,319
There is no such thing.

671
00:44:01,364 --> 00:44:04,701
When we're afraid,
what do we do?

672
00:44:04,734 --> 00:44:06,670
What have we done before?

673
00:44:06,703 --> 00:44:09,573
We follow through.

674
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,508
That's what we do.

675
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:13,209
Right?

676
00:44:15,345 --> 00:44:16,680
Right.

677
00:44:19,482 --> 00:44:20,850
We found the girl.

678
00:44:20,884 --> 00:44:22,586
She's en route.

679
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,654
-Cost me a fortune.
-What?

680
00:44:24,688 --> 00:44:27,290
-Wait, you found her?
-Yeah, found them both.

681
00:44:27,324 --> 00:44:29,726
Her and the little raptor.

682
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:32,295
Blue reproduced all on her own.

683
00:44:33,263 --> 00:44:35,432
Just like you said.
You're so smart, Henry.

684
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:39,869
That's why this works.

685
00:44:39,903 --> 00:44:42,205
You understand the value
of these creatures.

686
00:44:42,238 --> 00:44:43,740
You always have. I do, too.

687
00:44:43,773 --> 00:44:46,176
And we don't stop
because a, what,

688
00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:48,111
little side project went south?

689
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:53,183
Hey. If they trace
the locusts back to us,

690
00:44:53,216 --> 00:44:54,718
they come for the dinosaurs.

691
00:44:54,751 --> 00:44:56,453
All your work gone.

692
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,457
Billions of dollars
in assets gone.

693
00:45:01,558 --> 00:45:04,561
Diamonds with no one
to mine them.

694
00:45:05,462 --> 00:45:07,697
You really think
she's the solution?

695
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,769
Okay.

696
00:45:13,803 --> 00:45:16,439
Everything involving the girl
goes through me, right?

697
00:45:18,308 --> 00:45:19,809
Is she all right?

698
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:21,378
She better be.

699
00:45:21,979 --> 00:45:23,480
She's the most valuable

700
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:25,682
intellectual property
on the planet.

701
00:45:35,692 --> 00:45:37,260
I said I'd call you.

702
00:45:37,293 --> 00:45:38,528
They land yet?

703
00:45:38,561 --> 00:45:40,263
Second plane is incoming.

704
00:45:40,296 --> 00:45:41,665
Who said anything
about a second plane?

705
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:42,967
We flew them separately.

706
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,434
I'm not taking any chances.

707
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:46,836
And we'll need payment
before delivery.

708
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:48,939
I didn't like
what happened last time.

709
00:45:48,973 --> 00:45:52,542
Okay. Okay, just...
call me when it's done.

710
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:04,254
You said I was going
someplace safe.

711
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:05,990
You are.

712
00:46:13,329 --> 00:46:14,798
Walk to the car.

713
00:46:15,799 --> 00:46:18,468
-No.
-It's not a choice.

714
00:46:31,381 --> 00:46:34,651
50 grand to fly
one little raptor.

715
00:46:34,684 --> 00:46:36,619
Not bad.

716
00:46:41,391 --> 00:46:42,792
What's with the girl?

717
00:46:45,328 --> 00:46:47,630
Not your problem.

718
00:46:55,371 --> 00:46:57,841
Pleasure doing business.

719
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:02,746
We're ready. Let's go.

720
00:47:08,785 --> 00:47:10,386
Owen.

721
00:47:15,458 --> 00:47:17,393
-Hi, Claire.
-Mm.

722
00:47:17,427 --> 00:47:20,030
I thought you would've chosen
a quieter line of work.

723
00:47:20,064 --> 00:47:21,898
I tried.
My cousin and I opened a café.

724
00:47:21,932 --> 00:47:23,733
I lasted three weeks.

725
00:47:23,767 --> 00:47:26,503
The way the world is headed,
it's hard to look away.

726
00:47:26,536 --> 00:47:29,472
<i>Delacourt was hired</i>
<i>by Soyona Santos,</i>

727
00:47:29,506 --> 00:47:31,508
a broker in
the underground dinosaur trade.

728
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:33,810
We don't have intel
on his cargo,

729
00:47:33,843 --> 00:47:35,645
but once they make the exchange,

730
00:47:35,678 --> 00:47:37,647
we'll see what they know
about your girl.

731
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,615
You can listen in,

732
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,817
but promise me
you will not make contact.

733
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:42,418
No.

734
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:45,655
<i>Ouais, c'est ça.</i>

735
00:47:45,688 --> 00:47:47,390
<i>There is a big</i>
<i>underground market</i>

736
00:47:47,423 --> 00:47:48,658
<i>for dinosaurs now--</i>

737
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:50,894
<i>Europe, Middle East,</i>
<i>northern Africa.</i>

738
00:47:50,927 --> 00:47:52,662
It all comes through here.

739
00:48:02,906 --> 00:48:05,809
Don't look at anyone.
Don't talk to anyone.

740
00:48:05,842 --> 00:48:07,677
Just try to blend in.

741
00:48:56,961 --> 00:48:59,596
Hey, still flying
for Santos, huh?

742
00:48:59,629 --> 00:49:01,932
-You must need money.
-What's it to you?

743
00:49:01,966 --> 00:49:03,867
I've got cargo.

744
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,870
Thousand kilos of dinosaur
to Palermo.

745
00:49:06,903 --> 00:49:09,106
I give you 2,000.

746
00:49:09,139 --> 00:49:11,774
2,000? How much is there?

747
00:49:21,185 --> 00:49:23,053
You lost?

748
00:49:23,087 --> 00:49:24,754
You're American.

749
00:49:26,056 --> 00:49:27,523
That make us friends?

750
00:49:27,557 --> 00:49:29,626
Listen, I just got here, and...

751
00:49:29,659 --> 00:49:32,829
Oh, no, that was not
an invitation. Here.

752
00:49:35,065 --> 00:49:36,934
Souvenir. Go back to the hotel.

753
00:49:36,967 --> 00:49:39,502
You know, throw some bath salts
in the bath.

754
00:49:39,535 --> 00:49:42,006
This place--not your vibe.

755
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:44,008
Wait.

756
00:49:44,041 --> 00:49:45,943
-Look...
-Claire.

757
00:49:46,809 --> 00:49:49,612
Claire, I know this must
feel exotic,

758
00:49:49,646 --> 00:49:51,915
but if you mess with
the wrong person down here,

759
00:49:51,949 --> 00:49:53,017
you disappear.

760
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:54,118
You feel me?

761
00:49:54,151 --> 00:49:57,453
-Good luck, okay?
-Wait.

762
00:49:59,957 --> 00:50:01,624
-Wait.
-What is this?

763
00:50:01,658 --> 00:50:03,693
-I need your help.
-I don't know you.

764
00:50:03,726 --> 00:50:05,862
-I'm looking for someone.
-Don't do that.

765
00:50:05,895 --> 00:50:07,998
She is all alone. Please.

766
00:50:13,569 --> 00:50:16,439
-That your daughter?
-Yes.

767
00:50:18,741 --> 00:50:20,843
Sorry. I can't get involved.

768
00:50:39,296 --> 00:50:40,897
Think I got him.

769
00:50:40,931 --> 00:50:42,099
Target on the move.

770
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,202
That's our undercover agent
with him.

771
00:50:45,235 --> 00:50:47,204
Claire, he's headed underground.

772
00:50:47,237 --> 00:50:48,871
-See him?
-Yeah, I've got him.

773
00:50:50,941 --> 00:50:52,109
All right, let's go.

774
00:50:52,142 --> 00:50:53,576
<i>Team four,</i>

775
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:54,811
<i>need you to sweep</i>
<i>spreading south.</i>

776
00:50:58,881 --> 00:51:01,484
All units,
take up bull's-eye position.

777
00:51:02,618 --> 00:51:05,122
This is Bravo One.
Primary target in sight.

778
00:51:05,155 --> 00:51:06,856
No sign of the girl.

779
00:51:06,889 --> 00:51:08,591
Alpha team, stand clear.

780
00:51:18,768 --> 00:51:23,040
My people say the raptor
arrived in good condition.

781
00:51:23,073 --> 00:51:25,142
You boys didn't cock this up.

782
00:51:25,175 --> 00:51:27,011
Color me amazed.

783
00:51:27,044 --> 00:51:28,644
I do have another job for you.

784
00:51:28,678 --> 00:51:30,280
Short hop. Money's double.

785
00:51:30,314 --> 00:51:31,881
What's the cargo?

786
00:51:33,649 --> 00:51:35,986
<i>Atrociraptors.</i>

787
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,553
Thoroughbreds.

788
00:51:37,587 --> 00:51:38,956
Trained to kill.

789
00:51:38,989 --> 00:51:40,057
Kill who?

790
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:41,758
Whoever they're told.

791
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:43,626
Laser marks the target,
they attach to the scent,

792
00:51:43,659 --> 00:51:45,029
don't stop till it's dead.

793
00:51:45,062 --> 00:51:46,296
Inescapable.

794
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,664
Those idiots making hybrids
had it all wrong.

795
00:51:48,698 --> 00:51:50,767
You can't engineer loyalty.

796
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,635
You have to nurture it.

797
00:51:52,668 --> 00:51:55,005
50,000 to fly them to Riyadh.

798
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:57,107
In or out?

799
00:51:57,141 --> 00:51:59,109
She's not here.

800
00:52:03,013 --> 00:52:04,814
Where are we going?

801
00:52:05,681 --> 00:52:07,051
Almost there.

802
00:52:12,855 --> 00:52:14,324
That's the drop. Let's go.

803
00:52:14,358 --> 00:52:16,659
-Weapons down!
-Eyes on 'em!

804
00:52:16,692 --> 00:52:18,162
-Hands in the air!
-Contact made!

805
00:52:18,195 --> 00:52:20,663
Delacourt, on the floor now!

806
00:52:20,696 --> 00:52:21,764
Get on the ground!

807
00:52:21,798 --> 00:52:23,367
Delacourt! Stay with him!

808
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,901
Shit.

809
00:52:26,303 --> 00:52:27,804
Get that truck out of here!

810
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:37,214
We lost Delacourt!

811
00:52:49,293 --> 00:52:50,961
This is Bravo One.

812
00:52:50,994 --> 00:52:52,930
Truck is approaching
the underpass.

813
00:54:06,802 --> 00:54:08,438
Come on!

814
00:54:23,353 --> 00:54:24,754
The girl, where is she?

815
00:54:24,787 --> 00:54:26,456
-Where did they take her?
-Get it off!

816
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,325
-Where is she?
-I don't know!

817
00:54:28,358 --> 00:54:30,127
We handed her off to Santos.

818
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,429
I don't know where
they took her after that.

819
00:54:45,375 --> 00:54:47,110
Claire, it's Santos.

820
00:54:47,144 --> 00:54:49,012
-The woman in white.
-I'll find her.

821
00:54:49,046 --> 00:54:51,847
Bravo team, watch your six.

822
00:54:52,815 --> 00:54:55,085
Hey, hey!

823
00:54:55,118 --> 00:54:57,020
-Hey!
-Hold it!

824
00:54:57,054 --> 00:54:58,921
Let them out.

825
00:54:58,956 --> 00:54:59,755
What?!

826
00:54:59,789 --> 00:55:01,891
You heard me.

827
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:28,252
Merde.

828
00:55:45,901 --> 00:55:47,938
Claire, do you have her?

829
00:56:01,318 --> 00:56:02,818
We had some trouble.

830
00:56:02,852 --> 00:56:04,554
-What kind?
-The parents.

831
00:56:04,588 --> 00:56:06,590
Grady and Dearing--
they're here.

832
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,162
Can you take care of it?

833
00:56:12,195 --> 00:56:13,863
Not for free.

834
00:56:13,896 --> 00:56:16,033
Well, do it.

835
00:56:23,906 --> 00:56:26,842
Mama.

836
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,282
Okay, okay, listen.

837
00:56:32,316 --> 00:56:33,916
No, no, no.

838
00:56:46,997 --> 00:56:48,932
You don't use it on people.

839
00:56:48,965 --> 00:56:50,067
Where's my daughter?

840
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:52,469
She wasn't yours to begin with.

841
00:56:54,471 --> 00:56:56,340
Tell me.

842
00:56:57,541 --> 00:56:59,076
Biosyn.

843
00:56:59,109 --> 00:57:02,245
They're taking her to Biosyn.

844
00:57:07,517 --> 00:57:09,553
You missed her.

845
00:57:09,586 --> 00:57:11,154
She's gone.

846
00:58:03,006 --> 00:58:04,574
Take my hand. Come on.

847
00:58:35,372 --> 00:58:36,706
Hold on tight.

848
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,508
What?

849
00:58:48,652 --> 00:58:51,555
Do you remember how we used to
get the raptors in the truck?

850
00:58:51,588 --> 00:58:53,223
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

851
00:58:54,491 --> 00:58:55,759
-You're up.
-No.

852
00:58:57,727 --> 00:58:59,062
At the last minute, dive-roll.

853
00:58:59,095 --> 00:59:01,231
-I don't dive-roll.
-You'll be fine.

854
00:59:01,264 --> 00:59:03,433
I never got the timing right.

855
00:59:04,768 --> 00:59:06,102
Now?

856
00:59:06,136 --> 00:59:08,104
Any minute. Any minute now.

857
00:59:08,705 --> 00:59:10,507
-Now?
-No.

858
00:59:12,642 --> 00:59:14,177
Now!

859
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,549
Yeah. Yeah!

860
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:22,018
Freeze.

861
00:59:29,226 --> 00:59:30,427
I'm flying us out of here.

862
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,128
Tell me where
you want to be dropped.

863
00:59:32,162 --> 00:59:33,597
You ever flown to Biosyn?

864
00:59:35,165 --> 00:59:37,367
Owen, they took her to Biosyn!

865
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,736
-There's an airfield on the
north side of the island. -Go.

866
00:59:39,769 --> 00:59:41,438
You're under arrest.

867
00:59:41,471 --> 00:59:43,173
Stay where you are.

868
01:00:09,299 --> 01:00:11,201
Right!

869
01:00:15,672 --> 01:00:16,773
Heads up!

870
01:01:54,738 --> 01:01:56,439
We made a lot of enemies today.

871
01:01:56,473 --> 01:01:57,374
We got to go.

872
01:01:57,407 --> 01:01:58,943
-He'll be here.
-Uh-huh.

873
01:02:02,812 --> 01:02:05,215
Out of time, out of time.

874
01:02:06,683 --> 01:02:08,451
There he is.

875
01:02:10,353 --> 01:02:12,756
-Pull over.
-That's not how planes work.

876
01:02:18,963 --> 01:02:20,730
Open the back.

877
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:40,583
Come on!

878
01:02:45,321 --> 01:02:48,324
Hold on tight!

879
01:03:04,274 --> 01:03:06,743
Oh, sh...

880
01:03:17,287 --> 01:03:18,755
Still got it.

881
01:03:37,774 --> 01:03:39,909
Kayla Watts.

882
01:03:39,944 --> 01:03:41,644
You're welcome.

883
01:03:41,678 --> 01:03:43,646
You don't look like
you fly for Biosyn.

884
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,315
I'm gonna take that
the way you meant it

885
01:03:45,348 --> 01:03:47,283
and not the way it sounded.

886
01:03:47,317 --> 01:03:48,785
I fly from whoever got a bag,

887
01:03:48,818 --> 01:03:50,386
but we'll call this one a favor.

888
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:53,289
Those don't work. They broke.

889
01:03:54,424 --> 01:03:55,725
I'll take y'all to Biosyn,

890
01:03:55,759 --> 01:03:57,727
but I can't promise
it won't be dangerous.

891
01:03:57,761 --> 01:04:00,797
You're willing to risk your
life for people you never met?

892
01:04:02,066 --> 01:04:05,401
You want to ask questions,
or you want a ride?

893
01:04:08,038 --> 01:04:09,773
We'll take the ride.

894
01:04:16,713 --> 01:04:18,815
So, this is our habitat
development lab.

895
01:04:18,848 --> 01:04:21,518
A lot of exciting discoveries
as of late.

896
01:04:21,551 --> 01:04:23,020
We've brought back
numerous species

897
01:04:23,053 --> 01:04:24,454
in their purest form,

898
01:04:24,487 --> 01:04:26,790
and I mean complete,
untouched genomes.

899
01:04:26,823 --> 01:04:28,424
Like <i>Moros intrepidus.</i>

900
01:04:28,458 --> 01:04:30,060
-What?
-Yeah.

901
01:04:31,628 --> 01:04:32,997
Wow.

902
01:04:36,066 --> 01:04:37,968
What about splicing DNA?

903
01:04:38,002 --> 01:04:39,803
You know, creating new species?

904
01:04:39,836 --> 01:04:42,472
Uh, no, Dr. Sattler,
we don't do that here.

905
01:04:42,505 --> 01:04:44,574
We like to think
we're more evolved.

906
01:04:49,146 --> 01:04:50,446
Okay, it looks like
we still have

907
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:51,514
some time left before your ride.

908
01:04:51,548 --> 01:04:53,583
Uh, would you guys like to tour

909
01:04:53,616 --> 01:04:54,985
the facilities yourselves?

910
01:04:55,019 --> 01:04:57,420
Oh, uh, I mean...

911
01:04:57,453 --> 01:04:59,089
uh, we could.

912
01:04:59,123 --> 01:05:00,958
-Yeah, why not?
-Great.

913
01:05:00,991 --> 01:05:03,426
I'll meet you guys at
the hyperloop, station three,

914
01:05:03,459 --> 01:05:05,562
in about 30 minutes.

915
01:05:05,595 --> 01:05:07,697
Elevators are down this hall.
Not-not those.

916
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:09,599
Those lead you down
to the sublevels.

917
01:05:09,632 --> 01:05:11,801
You need special clearance
to get down there.

918
01:05:11,835 --> 01:05:14,470
-Oh, okay.
-30 minutes.

919
01:05:23,013 --> 01:05:24,814
Here.

920
01:05:24,848 --> 01:05:26,482
Take this.

921
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,919
-Okay?
-Yep.

922
01:05:39,495 --> 01:05:42,599
I'm really sorry
that it had to happen this way.

923
01:05:42,632 --> 01:05:44,901
Yep, that's what kidnappers say.

924
01:05:46,436 --> 01:05:48,072
Claire should never
have hidden you away.

925
01:05:48,105 --> 01:05:50,640
You're way too important,
Maisie.

926
01:05:54,544 --> 01:05:56,713
You took her, too.

927
01:05:57,714 --> 01:05:59,149
Yeah.

928
01:05:59,183 --> 01:06:01,952
We needed her
to help us understand you.

929
01:06:06,923 --> 01:06:08,925
Hey, Beta.

930
01:06:09,994 --> 01:06:11,761
You okay?

931
01:06:11,794 --> 01:06:13,063
Did you say "Beta"?

932
01:06:13,097 --> 01:06:14,764
Is that her name?

933
01:06:15,765 --> 01:06:17,034
I gave it to her.

934
01:06:17,067 --> 01:06:18,668
Beta's pretty special.

935
01:06:18,701 --> 01:06:21,771
You know, when we made Blue,
we used monitor lizard DNA

936
01:06:21,804 --> 01:06:24,607
to fill in the gaps
in her genome.

937
01:06:24,641 --> 01:06:27,577
Monitor lizards can reproduce
without a mate,

938
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:31,547
so Beta and Blue
are genetically identical,

939
01:06:31,581 --> 01:06:33,650
and that's what they have
in common with you and...

940
01:06:33,683 --> 01:06:35,551
Charlotte.

941
01:06:37,687 --> 01:06:39,756
What do you know
about Charlotte?

942
01:06:39,789 --> 01:06:41,524
She died.

943
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:43,793
A long time ago.

944
01:06:44,627 --> 01:06:46,696
It broke my grandpa's heart.

945
01:06:48,198 --> 01:06:49,934
So he made me.

946
01:06:51,501 --> 01:06:53,736
No, Maisie, actually, he didn't.

947
01:06:56,073 --> 01:06:58,508
Charlotte made you.

948
01:07:00,843 --> 01:07:03,713
I'm so excited for everyone to
see what we've been doing here.

949
01:07:03,746 --> 01:07:07,051
There's new technology
being made, new science,

950
01:07:07,084 --> 01:07:08,986
like, every day almost.

951
01:07:09,019 --> 01:07:10,586
And it's great to be...

952
01:07:10,620 --> 01:07:12,156
it's great to be
in the center...

953
01:07:12,189 --> 01:07:13,823
center of that.

954
01:07:13,856 --> 01:07:18,228
Charlotte lived
on Site B with all of us.

955
01:07:18,262 --> 01:07:20,630
Till the storm.

956
01:07:20,663 --> 01:07:21,966
She loved dinosaurs.

957
01:07:21,999 --> 01:07:23,566
Charlotte, be careful.

958
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:24,901
Yeah, I will.

959
01:07:24,935 --> 01:07:27,037
She grew up around scientists.

960
01:07:28,005 --> 01:07:30,540
Then, eventually...

961
01:07:31,175 --> 01:07:32,842
...she became one herself.

962
01:07:32,875 --> 01:07:34,877
A butterfly flew into
my office this morning.

963
01:07:34,911 --> 01:07:37,281
They say tiny things
have huge impacts,

964
01:07:37,314 --> 01:07:39,283
and I agree wholeheartedly.

965
01:07:39,316 --> 01:07:41,718
She was brilliant.

966
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,022
In ways that I'll never be.

967
01:07:45,055 --> 01:07:46,589
In the metaphysics of identity,

968
01:07:46,622 --> 01:07:48,758
can a replica
truly be the original?

969
01:07:48,791 --> 01:07:52,762
And if it's possible,
what makes it so?

970
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,669
I've lost my pen.

971
01:08:02,905 --> 01:08:04,141
Is that me?

972
01:08:04,174 --> 01:08:06,542
Yeah.

973
01:08:06,576 --> 01:08:08,245
Just like Blue,
Charlotte was able

974
01:08:08,278 --> 01:08:10,580
to have a child all by herself.

975
01:08:11,281 --> 01:08:15,052
She created you
with her own DNA.

976
01:08:16,053 --> 01:08:18,022
So I do have a mother.

977
01:08:18,055 --> 01:08:21,557
Your grandfather didn't want
anyone to know the truth.

978
01:08:21,591 --> 01:08:24,660
He was protecting her and you.

979
01:08:25,295 --> 01:08:26,930
And we're the same?

980
01:08:28,898 --> 01:08:29,766
You were.

981
01:08:29,799 --> 01:08:32,202
When you were a baby,
Charlotte started

982
01:08:32,236 --> 01:08:34,238
to show symptoms
of a genetic disorder.

983
01:08:34,271 --> 01:08:36,873
That's how she died.

984
01:08:36,906 --> 01:08:40,643
She didn't know she had it
until after you were born.

985
01:08:40,676 --> 01:08:42,712
Do I have it, too?

986
01:08:42,745 --> 01:08:43,780
No.

987
01:08:43,813 --> 01:08:46,183
She changed your DNA.

988
01:08:46,216 --> 01:08:49,053
She altered every cell
in your body

989
01:08:49,086 --> 01:08:51,121
to eradicate this disease.

990
01:08:51,155 --> 01:08:54,124
No one on earth has ever
known how to do that.

991
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:56,093
She fixed me.

992
01:08:56,126 --> 01:08:59,129
Charlotte's discovery
is a part of you now.

993
01:09:01,098 --> 01:09:04,368
Your DNA could change the world.

994
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:06,702
And I have to know
how she did it,

995
01:09:06,736 --> 01:09:09,073
but I just can't
replicate her work.

996
01:09:09,106 --> 01:09:10,773
If I could just study you

997
01:09:10,807 --> 01:09:14,178
and Beta, whose DNA
was never changed, I could...

998
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:19,316
...fix a terrible mistake
that I've made.

999
01:09:19,349 --> 01:09:21,651
What kind of mistake?

1000
01:09:29,393 --> 01:09:32,062
Sublevel six. Restricted.

1001
01:09:36,266 --> 01:09:38,135
Thanks for coming.

1002
01:09:42,738 --> 01:09:44,408
Which lab did Malcolm say?

1003
01:09:44,441 --> 01:09:46,709
L4.

1004
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:52,682
This is it.

1005
01:10:11,068 --> 01:10:15,105
Okay, get in,
get the sample and get out.

1006
01:10:15,139 --> 01:10:16,406
And move slow.

1007
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:19,176
They can swarm at
the slightest disturbance.

1008
01:10:43,333 --> 01:10:45,102
Orthoptera.

1009
01:10:46,069 --> 01:10:48,038
Two weeks.

1010
01:10:51,441 --> 01:10:53,443
Fully mature.

1011
01:10:53,477 --> 01:10:55,179
This one.

1012
01:10:57,114 --> 01:10:59,082
Ready? Easy.

1013
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,055
Okay.

1014
01:11:05,088 --> 01:11:06,722
Go.

1015
01:11:07,357 --> 01:11:08,791
What?

1016
01:11:09,526 --> 01:11:11,295
Go get it.

1017
01:11:13,096 --> 01:11:14,464
Is that necessary?

1018
01:11:14,498 --> 01:11:17,134
What did you think
was gonna happen?

1019
01:11:17,167 --> 01:11:18,402
I have to take a sample.

1020
01:11:18,435 --> 01:11:20,103
We need concrete evidence.
This is it.

1021
01:11:20,137 --> 01:11:22,306
Alan, you said
there was no time.

1022
01:11:22,339 --> 01:11:23,806
Can you get it?

1023
01:11:23,839 --> 01:11:26,043
Of course I can get it.

1024
01:11:26,977 --> 01:11:29,779
Easy. -

1025
01:11:30,414 --> 01:11:32,082
Watch its legs.

1026
01:11:34,518 --> 01:11:36,220
Here we go.

1027
01:11:38,021 --> 01:11:39,356
They're cell signaling
between them.

1028
01:11:39,389 --> 01:11:40,457
This is not good, Ellie.

1029
01:11:40,490 --> 01:11:41,824
Almost got it.

1030
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:46,762
How does she remain
an asset, Henry,

1031
01:11:46,796 --> 01:11:48,498
if you're incriminating
both of us

1032
01:11:48,532 --> 01:11:50,866
by showing her classified things
on the computer?

1033
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,135
Charlotte Lockwood believed

1034
01:11:52,169 --> 01:11:53,769
the methods we used
at Jurassic Park

1035
01:11:53,803 --> 01:11:55,771
could cure disease.

1036
01:11:55,805 --> 01:11:57,107
She was right.

1037
01:11:57,140 --> 01:11:59,509
Having filled the gaps
in Maisie's genome

1038
01:11:59,543 --> 01:12:01,478
with altered DNA,

1039
01:12:01,511 --> 01:12:03,080
she used a pathogen to deliver

1040
01:12:03,113 --> 01:12:05,249
the repaired sequence
to every cell.

1041
01:12:05,282 --> 01:12:07,517
If I can repurpose what she did,

1042
01:12:07,551 --> 01:12:09,953
I could change the locusts' DNA,

1043
01:12:09,987 --> 01:12:12,122
eradicating them
in a single generation.

1044
01:12:12,155 --> 01:12:16,260
Maisie and the baby raptor
will provide the missing data.

1045
01:12:23,066 --> 01:12:25,801
Hey, do you want
to get out of here?

1046
01:12:28,871 --> 01:12:31,041
What the...?

1047
01:12:31,942 --> 01:12:33,277
Got it.

1048
01:12:37,447 --> 01:12:39,149
Go!

1049
01:12:43,287 --> 01:12:45,289
They're everywhere!

1050
01:12:45,322 --> 01:12:47,024
Help me! Oh, God!

1051
01:12:47,057 --> 01:12:48,992
No!

1052
01:12:51,061 --> 01:12:52,862
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1053
01:12:58,168 --> 01:12:59,536
Maisie.

1054
01:13:11,081 --> 01:13:12,949
Asset containment breach.

1055
01:13:12,983 --> 01:13:14,985
Please remain at your stations.

1056
01:13:16,486 --> 01:13:17,954
Asset containment breach.

1057
01:13:17,988 --> 01:13:19,589
Please remain at your stations.

1058
01:13:22,225 --> 01:13:25,028
-Oh, my God! Oh, God, I can't
see! -Where's the key?

1059
01:13:43,513 --> 01:13:45,349
You okay?

1060
01:13:45,382 --> 01:13:47,084
Yeah.

1061
01:13:47,117 --> 01:13:48,485
You?

1062
01:13:48,518 --> 01:13:49,986
Yeah.

1063
01:13:52,255 --> 01:13:53,856
Oh.

1064
01:13:59,196 --> 01:14:03,567
You're Dr. Ellie Sattler
and Alan Grant.

1065
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,901
You were at Jurassic Park.

1066
01:14:05,936 --> 01:14:07,971
What-what are you doing here?

1067
01:14:08,004 --> 01:14:09,940
What? What...

1068
01:14:09,973 --> 01:14:12,042
what are you doing here?

1069
01:14:13,710 --> 01:14:15,979
I'm Maisie Lockwood.

1070
01:14:24,254 --> 01:14:25,989
Um...

1071
01:14:26,022 --> 01:14:29,159
Hey, we don't, uh...

1072
01:14:29,192 --> 01:14:31,561
we're not...
we don't work for Biosyn.

1073
01:14:31,595 --> 01:14:32,696
I can tell.

1074
01:14:32,729 --> 01:14:34,264
We got to get out of here.

1075
01:14:34,297 --> 01:14:35,399
Yeah, we should go.

1076
01:14:51,014 --> 01:14:53,984
Okay, in and out--
we find your girl and go.

1077
01:14:55,051 --> 01:14:56,686
Tower, this is N-141.

1078
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:58,422
Request to land for
a freight delivery. Over.

1079
01:14:58,455 --> 01:15:01,024
Uh, N-141, negative.
We've been advised

1080
01:15:01,057 --> 01:15:03,160
you're carrying
unauthorized passengers. Over.

1081
01:15:03,193 --> 01:15:04,561
Copy that, tower.

1082
01:15:04,594 --> 01:15:06,963
Be advised
shipment is perishable.

1083
01:15:06,997 --> 01:15:08,298
We need immediate clearance.

1084
01:15:08,331 --> 01:15:11,034
-It's an emergency. Over.
-There isn't... No.

1085
01:15:11,067 --> 01:15:13,470
Uh, negative.
Return to point of origin.

1086
01:15:13,503 --> 01:15:15,038
Uh, you seem to be breaking up.

1087
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,406
Are-are you hearing me
on your side?

1088
01:15:18,642 --> 01:15:21,144
Nice try, Kayla.
They will down your bird.

1089
01:15:21,778 --> 01:15:24,047
Who is this? Is this Denise?

1090
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:26,550
You do not want me to start
spilling secrets, Denise.

1091
01:15:26,583 --> 01:15:28,318
You remember Dubrovnik.

1092
01:15:29,686 --> 01:15:32,756
She's... Different Denise.

1093
01:15:32,789 --> 01:15:35,091
In accounts.

1094
01:15:41,765 --> 01:15:43,600
Talked to Santos.

1095
01:15:43,633 --> 01:15:45,335
It's the girl's parents.

1096
01:15:48,104 --> 01:15:50,407
Sh-Shut off the ADS.

1097
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:52,409
You sure?

1098
01:15:52,442 --> 01:15:54,411
Uh-huh.

1099
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:01,685
What's that?

1100
01:16:01,718 --> 01:16:03,687
Uh, that's the, uh...

1101
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,522
that's the aerial
deterrent system.

1102
01:16:05,555 --> 01:16:06,756
Keeps the airborne life away.

1103
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:08,458
Why is it blinking?

1104
01:16:08,492 --> 01:16:10,360
Because dead-ass Denise in
the tower just turned it off.

1105
01:16:10,393 --> 01:16:12,162
We got to get out of
this airspace right now.

1106
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:20,103
-That's another plane, right?
-Not exactly.

1107
01:16:23,073 --> 01:16:24,474
Is that a...

1108
01:16:24,508 --> 01:16:26,176
<i>Quetzalcoatlus.</i>

1109
01:16:26,209 --> 01:16:28,512
Late Cretaceous.
Should've stayed there.

1110
01:16:34,551 --> 01:16:37,087
Okay. Okay.

1111
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,356
It's cool. We're good.
It's gone.

1112
01:16:56,339 --> 01:16:57,807
This plane is going down.

1113
01:16:57,841 --> 01:17:01,111
If you're going to eject,
you need to do it now.

1114
01:17:01,144 --> 01:17:03,179
I only got one chair,
and she's in it.

1115
01:17:03,213 --> 01:17:06,182
-You don't have parachutes?
-I wasn't expecting company.

1116
01:17:13,857 --> 01:17:15,292
Claire.

1117
01:17:15,325 --> 01:17:16,826
We got to get you
off this plane.

1118
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,328
What?

1119
01:17:18,361 --> 01:17:19,696
Parachute is gonna open
automatically.

1120
01:17:19,729 --> 01:17:20,830
If it doesn't,
you pull this lever.

1121
01:17:20,864 --> 01:17:22,132
Do you understand me?

1122
01:17:22,165 --> 01:17:23,700
Claire!

1123
01:17:23,733 --> 01:17:25,368
If it doesn't open
automatically,

1124
01:17:25,402 --> 01:17:27,170
you're gonna pull this lever
here behind you, okay?

1125
01:17:27,203 --> 01:17:29,239
-10,000 feet!
-Hey.

1126
01:17:29,272 --> 01:17:30,740
You're the one who's got to go
to get to her.

1127
01:17:30,774 --> 01:17:33,209
You're her mom.
You're her only shot.

1128
01:17:35,745 --> 01:17:38,181
I'll see you again.

1129
01:17:38,882 --> 01:17:41,384
I love you.

1130
01:18:29,899 --> 01:18:30,900
What's the plan?

1131
01:18:30,935 --> 01:18:32,736
Whatever happens.

1132
01:18:32,769 --> 01:18:34,571
That's the plan.

1133
01:18:48,251 --> 01:18:49,886
-Three.
-That's it.

1134
01:18:49,919 --> 01:18:51,788
Alan, we need the code.

1135
01:18:51,821 --> 01:18:53,189
Let's try this thing.

1136
01:18:53,223 --> 01:18:54,424
Yeah.

1137
01:18:54,457 --> 01:18:56,426
Get down.

1138
01:19:01,831 --> 01:19:03,533
-Thank God it's you.
-I don't know...

1139
01:19:03,566 --> 01:19:05,535
This place is such a maze.

1140
01:19:05,568 --> 01:19:06,937
-We were so confused.
-It's good you're here.

1141
01:19:06,971 --> 01:19:08,438
But I thought
we were straight-up lost,

1142
01:19:08,471 --> 01:19:09,940
then you said station three,
and I was like...

1143
01:19:09,974 --> 01:19:11,841
-We thought you said...
-Do you have the sample?

1144
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:14,210
-What?
-What are you talking about?

1145
01:19:14,244 --> 01:19:15,679
The DNA sample--do you have it?

1146
01:19:15,712 --> 01:19:18,448
Biosyn's responsible
for the locust epidemic.

1147
01:19:18,481 --> 01:19:20,216
Dodgson's covering it up.
You were right.

1148
01:19:20,250 --> 01:19:22,285
I'm-I'm here to help you.

1149
01:19:22,318 --> 01:19:23,887
Do you have it?

1150
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,522
-Uh...
-Yeah.

1151
01:19:25,555 --> 01:19:26,589
Good.

1152
01:19:27,624 --> 01:19:29,259
This pod will take you
straight to the airfield.

1153
01:19:29,292 --> 01:19:30,860
We have a plane ready to fly.

1154
01:19:30,894 --> 01:19:32,562
Ian told you
about Hexapod Allies?

1155
01:19:32,595 --> 01:19:34,698
No. I told him.

1156
01:19:34,731 --> 01:19:36,299
What?

1157
01:19:36,332 --> 01:19:38,568
-Okay, you guys got to go.
-Wait.

1158
01:19:42,338 --> 01:19:44,340
Maisie.

1159
01:19:47,610 --> 01:19:48,812
Maisie Lockwood.

1160
01:19:51,815 --> 01:19:53,349
Go.

1161
01:24:07,603 --> 01:24:09,572
That was my baby.

1162
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,950
Where'd you learn to fly?

1163
01:24:19,984 --> 01:24:21,918
Uh, Air Force.

1164
01:24:21,952 --> 01:24:23,253
Legacy on my mama's side.

1165
01:24:23,287 --> 01:24:25,022
Yeah. I'm Navy.

1166
01:24:25,888 --> 01:24:27,857
And so, how'd you end up
doing this?

1167
01:24:27,890 --> 01:24:30,127
I was a legit contract pilot
for a grip,

1168
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:31,661
but didn't exactly pay enough

1169
01:24:31,694 --> 01:24:33,197
to be out here
and send the money home,

1170
01:24:33,230 --> 01:24:36,133
so I hit up a few contacts for
the more lucrative shady shit.

1171
01:24:37,767 --> 01:24:40,137
Honestly, I might be done
with this line of work.

1172
01:24:40,170 --> 01:24:42,039
Is that why you're helping us?

1173
01:24:45,175 --> 01:24:48,511
I was there when they handed
your girl off to Biosyn.

1174
01:24:49,313 --> 01:24:52,749
I could've said something,
but I didn't.

1175
01:24:52,782 --> 01:24:54,985
And when I saw her picture...

1176
01:24:56,853 --> 01:24:58,921
It isn't enough to do nothing.

1177
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,795
Thank you.

1178
01:25:52,076 --> 01:25:53,977
No.

1179
01:25:58,248 --> 01:25:59,283
Nope.

1180
01:26:23,407 --> 01:26:25,675
What an asshole.

1181
01:27:16,326 --> 01:27:17,793
You good?

1182
01:27:17,827 --> 01:27:19,296
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1183
01:27:19,329 --> 01:27:20,763
Yeah, I'm not shook at all. You?

1184
01:27:20,796 --> 01:27:23,000
Nah. Nah, no.

1185
01:27:24,734 --> 01:27:26,702
The ejection seat beacon.

1186
01:27:26,736 --> 01:27:29,273
-We'll find her.
-Okay. Okay.

1187
01:27:29,306 --> 01:27:31,208
You really love her, huh?

1188
01:27:32,476 --> 01:27:34,244
Yeah.

1189
01:27:34,278 --> 01:27:35,979
I get it.

1190
01:27:36,846 --> 01:27:38,949
I like redheads, too.

1191
01:27:39,950 --> 01:27:41,485
What? God.

1192
01:27:44,988 --> 01:27:45,721
Who is that?

1193
01:27:45,755 --> 01:27:47,924
It's Grant and Sattler.

1194
01:27:47,958 --> 01:27:50,060
-Is this live?
-12 minutes ago.

1195
01:27:50,093 --> 01:27:51,861
We were tracking
the escaped asset.

1196
01:27:51,894 --> 01:27:53,130
Our guys missed it.

1197
01:27:53,163 --> 01:27:55,299
They stole a DNA sample.

1198
01:27:56,233 --> 01:27:58,335
-How'd they get in there?
-They used an access key.

1199
01:27:58,368 --> 01:28:00,504
Yankee White clearance.

1200
01:28:00,537 --> 01:28:02,506
One of our cameras
saw Ian Malcolm

1201
01:28:02,539 --> 01:28:05,075
put something
in Sattler's pocket.

1202
01:28:05,108 --> 01:28:07,211
All right.

1203
01:28:07,244 --> 01:28:08,512
I want to see him.

1204
01:28:08,545 --> 01:28:11,315
And get Ramsay up here,
too, will you?

1205
01:28:11,348 --> 01:28:12,748
Where are they now?

1206
01:28:12,782 --> 01:28:14,784
On the way to the airfield.

1207
01:28:14,817 --> 01:28:16,987
They caught the hyperloop
right on schedule.

1208
01:28:23,126 --> 01:28:24,962
How are you?

1209
01:28:24,995 --> 01:28:27,064
You all right?

1210
01:28:27,863 --> 01:28:29,765
Not really, no.

1211
01:28:31,368 --> 01:28:33,237
Hey.

1212
01:28:33,270 --> 01:28:36,006
I, uh, knew your mom.

1213
01:28:39,209 --> 01:28:40,344
You did?

1214
01:28:40,377 --> 01:28:42,112
Mm-hmm.

1215
01:28:43,146 --> 01:28:46,950
Yeah, a few years
after Hammond died,

1216
01:28:46,984 --> 01:28:50,988
she came to my university
to lecture, and...

1217
01:28:51,021 --> 01:28:53,123
we became good friends.

1218
01:28:53,156 --> 01:28:55,058
What was she like?

1219
01:28:55,092 --> 01:28:56,159
Brilliant.

1220
01:28:56,193 --> 01:28:58,262
Light-years ahead
of everybody else.

1221
01:28:59,829 --> 01:29:01,265
And she had a conscience.

1222
01:29:01,298 --> 01:29:03,866
While they were out
building theme parks,

1223
01:29:03,899 --> 01:29:05,502
well, she was
determined to prove

1224
01:29:05,535 --> 01:29:08,038
that genetic power
could save lives.

1225
01:29:09,239 --> 01:29:11,008
And I was her experiment.

1226
01:29:11,041 --> 01:29:12,342
No.

1227
01:29:14,211 --> 01:29:16,346
She wanted a child
more than anything.

1228
01:29:17,281 --> 01:29:20,883
But she wanted you to have
what she couldn't.

1229
01:29:21,518 --> 01:29:23,387
A full life.

1230
01:29:26,056 --> 01:29:28,225
I didn't know her long.

1231
01:29:29,092 --> 01:29:31,328
But I know
she loved you very much.

1232
01:29:51,481 --> 01:29:53,150
What's happening?

1233
01:29:57,954 --> 01:30:00,324
This must be
the old amber mines.

1234
01:30:01,358 --> 01:30:05,162
They must have made access doors
when they built these tunnels.

1235
01:30:29,286 --> 01:30:30,620
Hey.

1236
01:30:30,654 --> 01:30:33,090
I heard the alarm.
Everything all right?

1237
01:30:33,123 --> 01:30:35,492
Yeah, no, no.
Nothing we can't, uh, handle.

1238
01:30:35,525 --> 01:30:37,361
-Listen...
-You rang?

1239
01:30:37,394 --> 01:30:39,196
Oh, good. Dr. Malcolm.

1240
01:30:39,229 --> 01:30:41,365
You are... fired.

1241
01:30:41,398 --> 01:30:42,999
What?

1242
01:30:43,033 --> 01:30:46,236
It was such a cushy gig.

1243
01:30:46,269 --> 01:30:49,506
You can, uh, give
your access key to security,

1244
01:30:49,539 --> 01:30:51,241
if you still have it.

1245
01:30:51,274 --> 01:30:52,676
One of the hyperloop pods just
shut down in the amber mines.

1246
01:30:52,709 --> 01:30:54,411
What?

1247
01:30:55,412 --> 01:30:57,647
Wow. This day.

1248
01:30:57,681 --> 01:30:59,649
Uh, which... which pod are we...

1249
01:30:59,683 --> 01:31:01,651
Are there, um...

1250
01:31:01,685 --> 01:31:03,553
dinosaurs in the mines?

1251
01:31:03,587 --> 01:31:05,188
There are dinosaurs everywhere.

1252
01:31:05,222 --> 01:31:06,490
I mean, you know, technically,
birds are dinosaurs.

1253
01:31:06,523 --> 01:31:07,991
Ge-Genetically speaking...

1254
01:31:08,024 --> 01:31:09,393
Okay, Lewis, Grant and Sattler
are in this pod.

1255
01:31:09,426 --> 01:31:11,261
We need to send
a security team out there ASAP.

1256
01:31:11,294 --> 01:31:13,196
Okay. Absolutely, Ramsay.
Thank you.

1257
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:15,265
Uh, let's all just stay
in our lanes, though.

1258
01:31:15,298 --> 01:31:17,401
We can take care of it.
Thank you, Doctor.

1259
01:31:17,434 --> 01:31:20,070
That's it, huh?
Nothing else to see here?

1260
01:31:20,103 --> 01:31:23,340
Uh, I'm not sure I admire
your tone right now.

1261
01:31:23,373 --> 01:31:25,675
-You need to leave.
-Yeah, I do.

1262
01:31:25,709 --> 01:31:29,212
But first, I owe
all these folks an apology.

1263
01:31:29,246 --> 01:31:31,548
I think that by lending
my cachet to this joint

1264
01:31:31,581 --> 01:31:33,316
I might have made it seem as if

1265
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:35,018
Biosyn wasn't
rotten to the core.

1266
01:31:35,051 --> 01:31:36,186
That's enough, Ian.

1267
01:31:36,219 --> 01:31:37,554
See, here's how they get you.

1268
01:31:37,587 --> 01:31:38,722
They give you so many promotions

1269
01:31:38,755 --> 01:31:40,390
in a short period of time

1270
01:31:40,424 --> 01:31:42,292
that it bludgeons your capacity
for critical thinking.

1271
01:31:42,325 --> 01:31:45,162
-Oh, my God. -So then there are
doors that you don't open,

1272
01:31:45,195 --> 01:31:46,630
things that you ignore.

1273
01:31:46,663 --> 01:31:52,169
But mainly, he's exploiting
your enchantment with these.

1274
01:31:52,202 --> 01:31:54,237
Is there an actual concern
here, or are you just...

1275
01:31:54,271 --> 01:31:56,640
You're racing toward
the extinction of our species,

1276
01:31:56,673 --> 01:31:58,375
and you don't care.

1277
01:31:58,408 --> 01:32:01,411
You know exactly what you're
doing, but you won't stop.

1278
01:32:01,445 --> 01:32:02,712
You can't.

1279
01:32:02,746 --> 01:32:04,614
You know, I thought
you might be different,

1280
01:32:04,648 --> 01:32:06,149
but you're just like
everyone else.

1281
01:32:06,183 --> 01:32:07,584
You see what you want to see.

1282
01:32:07,617 --> 01:32:10,554
You imagine unchecked avarice,

1283
01:32:10,587 --> 01:32:12,355
so that's what you find.

1284
01:32:12,389 --> 01:32:15,659
You envision what,
an evil, unbound Prometheus?

1285
01:32:15,692 --> 01:32:17,194
So that's what I am to you?

1286
01:32:17,227 --> 01:32:18,728
Prometheus got gored.

1287
01:32:18,762 --> 01:32:21,298
So will you,
you rapacious rat bastard.

1288
01:32:21,331 --> 01:32:25,569
Ramsay, would you help
Dr. Malcolm gather his things?

1289
01:32:26,503 --> 01:32:29,139
His room, and then
to the airfield. That's it.

1290
01:32:38,448 --> 01:32:40,116
Dodgson.

1291
01:33:43,713 --> 01:33:45,515
Oh, God.

1292
01:34:13,209 --> 01:34:15,345
<i>Allosaurus?</i>

1293
01:34:16,580 --> 01:34:18,281
<i>Giganotosaurus.</i>

1294
01:34:18,315 --> 01:34:20,350
Largest known
terrestrial carnivore.

1295
01:34:21,284 --> 01:34:23,453
You put two apex predators
in one valley,

1296
01:34:23,486 --> 01:34:25,755
pretty soon there's only
gonna be one.

1297
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:59,222
Did you feel that?

1298
01:35:00,690 --> 01:35:02,392
That's an air current.

1299
01:35:02,425 --> 01:35:04,527
There must be
an opening up ahead.

1300
01:35:05,428 --> 01:35:07,631
How old is this mine,
do you think?

1301
01:35:07,664 --> 01:35:09,399
Just breathe.

1302
01:35:09,432 --> 01:35:11,601
Nobody panic.
Just watch out for bats.

1303
01:35:11,635 --> 01:35:13,503
-Who said anything about bats?
-I hate bats.

1304
01:35:13,536 --> 01:35:16,573
Well, there's probably no bats,
no falling rocks.

1305
01:35:16,606 --> 01:35:18,375
Just the possibility
of toxic gas,

1306
01:35:18,408 --> 01:35:19,843
dehydration, hypothermia.

1307
01:35:19,876 --> 01:35:21,911
Just possibilities,
nothing for certain.

1308
01:35:21,946 --> 01:35:23,813
Oh, I should've
left you where you were.

1309
01:35:23,847 --> 01:35:25,649
-Why did I bring you into this?
-What?

1310
01:35:25,682 --> 01:35:27,784
-You were happy
in your element. -What?

1311
01:35:27,817 --> 01:35:29,619
-Ellie.
-What?

1312
01:35:29,653 --> 01:35:31,554
I wasn't happy.

1313
01:35:32,555 --> 01:35:34,257
You weren't?

1314
01:35:34,290 --> 01:35:36,292
-Do you guys have kids?
-What?

1315
01:35:36,326 --> 01:35:37,962
Uh...

1316
01:35:37,995 --> 01:35:39,696
No, I-I do.

1317
01:35:39,729 --> 01:35:40,830
Two.

1318
01:35:40,864 --> 01:35:42,332
But not with him?

1319
01:35:43,833 --> 01:35:45,669
Uh...

1320
01:35:45,702 --> 01:35:47,570
no.

1321
01:35:47,604 --> 01:35:50,206
No, just old friends.

1322
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:53,410
Just old friends.

1323
01:35:53,443 --> 01:35:55,478
Really?

1324
01:35:59,649 --> 01:36:01,584
Won't be long before
security knows you're gone.

1325
01:36:01,618 --> 01:36:04,220
Oh, a map.
That looks like an old map.

1326
01:36:04,254 --> 01:36:05,221
You don't have a new map?

1327
01:36:05,255 --> 01:36:06,456
There's an access gate

1328
01:36:06,489 --> 01:36:07,958
at the northeast corner
of the mine.

1329
01:36:07,992 --> 01:36:09,259
-If your friends make it out...
-If?

1330
01:36:09,292 --> 01:36:10,727
When they make it out...

1331
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:12,562
-Yes, sir.
-...that's where they'll be.

1332
01:36:12,595 --> 01:36:15,632
These roads are protected,
right?

1333
01:36:15,665 --> 01:36:17,267
Uh, yeah. I'd drive fast.

1334
01:36:27,877 --> 01:36:29,746
You did good.

1335
01:36:29,779 --> 01:36:31,314
Uh, yeah, well, actually,

1336
01:36:31,347 --> 01:36:33,616
it's a complete disaster,
but thanks.

1337
01:36:34,617 --> 01:36:35,719
Not yet.

1338
01:36:46,496 --> 01:36:48,398
Watch yourself.

1339
01:37:07,017 --> 01:37:09,419
-Ellie.
-Yeah.

1340
01:37:13,923 --> 01:37:15,692
What was that?

1341
01:37:21,898 --> 01:37:23,533
Be careful.

1342
01:37:38,381 --> 01:37:39,682
-Oh, my God, Alan.
-Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1343
01:37:57,901 --> 01:37:59,435
Forget the hat!

1344
01:38:00,137 --> 01:38:02,505
Come on!

1345
01:38:09,746 --> 01:38:11,347
Go, go, go!

1346
01:38:11,982 --> 01:38:13,850
Go, go, go, go, go!

1347
01:38:18,055 --> 01:38:19,622
It's a car.

1348
01:38:21,391 --> 01:38:23,426
-Oh, my God. Ian!
-Ian, over here!

1349
01:38:24,794 --> 01:38:26,629
-Please, Ian!
-Open the gate.

1350
01:38:26,663 --> 01:38:28,098
Please help us.

1351
01:38:28,132 --> 01:38:29,732
Do you know the code?

1352
01:38:29,766 --> 01:38:31,734
I didn't know there was
gonna be a code.

1353
01:38:32,468 --> 01:38:34,470
I didn't know there was
gonna be a code.

1354
01:38:34,504 --> 01:38:36,941
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1355
01:38:38,441 --> 01:38:40,410
The brake! Pull the brake!

1356
01:38:40,443 --> 01:38:42,112
There are 10,000 possibilities.

1357
01:38:42,146 --> 01:38:44,581
Push your legs against it!

1358
01:38:44,614 --> 01:38:47,417
-1984.
-Come on, Ian!

1359
01:38:47,450 --> 01:38:49,552
Kick up against it! -Hurry!

1360
01:38:49,586 --> 01:38:53,723
Miles Davis's birthday--0526.

1361
01:38:57,927 --> 01:38:59,762
-Ian!
-Please, please.

1362
01:38:59,796 --> 01:39:00,897
Do something!

1363
01:39:00,930 --> 01:39:02,432
We're not gonna make it.

1364
01:39:02,465 --> 01:39:04,634
Let's-let's all try
and stay positive.

1365
01:39:20,683 --> 01:39:23,920
-Please.
-I know, I know, I know.

1366
01:39:29,226 --> 01:39:31,561
Oh, my God! Close it!

1367
01:39:33,063 --> 01:39:34,999
What do you know?
It actually worked.

1368
01:39:39,669 --> 01:39:41,905
Ian, this is Maisie.

1369
01:39:41,939 --> 01:39:43,740
Hi, Maisie.

1370
01:39:43,773 --> 01:39:45,608
We got the DNA.

1371
01:39:46,542 --> 01:39:47,911
We need to get out
of this valley.

1372
01:39:47,945 --> 01:39:50,813
-Yeah. Let's go. Let's go.
-Come on. Come on.

1373
01:40:21,711 --> 01:40:23,813
Come on. Come, come on.

1374
01:41:33,050 --> 01:41:34,985
Go on, get!

1375
01:41:35,019 --> 01:41:37,054
Yuck.

1376
01:41:37,087 --> 01:41:39,023
-Oh, my God.
-Hey.

1377
01:41:39,056 --> 01:41:41,258
Oh, my God.

1378
01:41:41,291 --> 01:41:42,960
I thought you were dead.

1379
01:41:42,993 --> 01:41:44,627
What do they even eat?

1380
01:41:49,699 --> 01:41:51,667
We better get inside.

1381
01:42:31,975 --> 01:42:33,876
Oh, go ahead.

1382
01:43:12,282 --> 01:43:15,018
Containment
chamber compromised.

1383
01:43:30,934 --> 01:43:32,002
It's locked.

1384
01:43:32,035 --> 01:43:34,804
Gonna need something heavy,
something sharp or both.

1385
01:43:45,449 --> 01:43:48,885
That... can't be right.

1386
01:44:00,297 --> 01:44:02,399
-Is that...?
-Oh, no.

1387
01:44:02,432 --> 01:44:04,268
Oh, my God.

1388
01:44:05,936 --> 01:44:07,870
He's burning the evidence.

1389
01:44:09,139 --> 01:44:10,474
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

1390
01:44:10,507 --> 01:44:12,742
-Oh, my... Ew!
-That's bananas.

1391
01:44:30,093 --> 01:44:30,994
Oh, my God.

1392
01:44:31,028 --> 01:44:36,699
I-I-I know this may seem
precarious, but...

1393
01:44:37,334 --> 01:44:38,901
No, we're-we're teetering.

1394
01:44:41,238 --> 01:44:43,473
Should we all lean
to the left or something?

1395
01:44:43,507 --> 01:44:45,209
That's very constructive.
Thank you, Maisie.

1396
01:44:45,242 --> 01:44:47,344
Yeah.

1397
01:44:47,377 --> 01:44:49,947
Slow. Slow.

1398
01:44:51,081 --> 01:44:52,848
Slow.

1399
01:44:55,018 --> 01:44:56,520
Yay.

1400
01:44:56,553 --> 01:44:58,121
We're fine.

1401
01:44:58,155 --> 01:44:59,957
-See this?
-Mm-hmm.

1402
01:44:59,990 --> 01:45:01,857
-This is fine.
-Mm-hmm.

1403
01:45:15,505 --> 01:45:17,074
Alan?

1404
01:45:17,107 --> 01:45:18,542
Alan!

1405
01:45:18,575 --> 01:45:20,177
How is everybody?

1406
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:32,356
It's my parents.

1407
01:45:33,323 --> 01:45:34,890
Help!

1408
01:45:34,924 --> 01:45:36,460
Help!

1409
01:45:36,493 --> 01:45:37,893
Listen.

1410
01:45:37,927 --> 01:45:40,796
Help! Help!

1411
01:45:45,035 --> 01:45:47,137
Oh, my God.

1412
01:45:47,170 --> 01:45:49,239
You're okay.

1413
01:45:49,273 --> 01:45:51,041
You're okay.

1414
01:45:51,074 --> 01:45:52,442
You came to get me, actually.

1415
01:45:52,476 --> 01:45:53,809
-You came to get me.
-Yeah.

1416
01:45:53,843 --> 01:45:55,979
Of course we did, sweetheart.

1417
01:45:56,013 --> 01:45:58,248
-Heya, kid.
-Of course.

1418
01:45:59,915 --> 01:46:01,952
I remember you.

1419
01:46:02,586 --> 01:46:05,188
Remember you, too.

1420
01:46:14,998 --> 01:46:16,967
They helped me escape.

1421
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,102
Yeah?

1422
01:46:21,271 --> 01:46:23,173
You okay?

1423
01:46:26,243 --> 01:46:28,078
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1424
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:32,049
We got to go.

1425
01:46:32,082 --> 01:46:35,118
Gonna have to break a window
to get inside that thing.

1426
01:46:35,986 --> 01:46:38,288
Hope nobody's afraid of heights.

1427
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:52,868
Don't move.

1428
01:47:11,021 --> 01:47:12,222
What is that?

1429
01:47:12,255 --> 01:47:14,358
<i>Giganotosaurus.</i>

1430
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:19,029
Biggest carnivore
the world has ever seen.

1431
01:47:37,414 --> 01:47:39,249
Maisie, Maisie, look at me.

1432
01:47:39,282 --> 01:47:41,017
Look at me.

1433
01:48:20,090 --> 01:48:22,159
-Go, go, go, go.
-Come on!

1434
01:48:26,329 --> 01:48:29,199
No, no, no! No!

1435
01:48:33,470 --> 01:48:35,338
-Hustle.
-I'm gonna die!

1436
01:48:35,372 --> 01:48:37,174
-Climb. Climb, kid.
-No!

1437
01:48:37,207 --> 01:48:39,976
-You're not. No, you're not.
-You're okay. -

1438
01:48:48,084 --> 01:48:50,387
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1439
01:49:06,636 --> 01:49:08,538
Come on.

1440
01:49:09,506 --> 01:49:11,208
Hey.

1441
01:49:17,414 --> 01:49:19,416
Oh, yeah. Come here.

1442
01:49:36,099 --> 01:49:38,435
-Go, go, go.
-Help me open it. Help me out.

1443
01:49:42,672 --> 01:49:44,641
I got ya.

1444
01:49:45,742 --> 01:49:47,377
Go, go, go.

1445
01:49:47,410 --> 01:49:49,145
Go, go, go, go, go!

1446
01:49:51,548 --> 01:49:52,582
Run.

1447
01:50:09,366 --> 01:50:11,301
See? Not so bad.

1448
01:50:17,607 --> 01:50:18,842
Come on.

1449
01:50:20,577 --> 01:50:22,312
Claire!

1450
01:51:04,154 --> 01:51:06,122
Call an evacuation.

1451
01:51:06,156 --> 01:51:08,191
We need to bring
the animals inside.

1452
01:51:08,224 --> 01:51:10,193
The regulations are clear
that in the event

1453
01:51:10,226 --> 01:51:12,362
-of a level two...
-Shh!

1454
01:51:13,530 --> 01:51:15,265
Jeffrey.

1455
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:22,272
God...

1456
01:51:22,305 --> 01:51:24,240
-...damn it!
-Oh.

1457
01:51:25,575 --> 01:51:27,844
Just...

1458
01:51:27,877 --> 01:51:29,379
Just call it.

1459
01:51:29,412 --> 01:51:31,514
Attention, attention.

1460
01:51:31,548 --> 01:51:33,883
This is an immediate
evacuation order.

1461
01:51:33,917 --> 01:51:36,219
Remote herding system
is now active.

1462
01:51:36,252 --> 01:51:39,623
All living assets en route
to emergency containment.

1463
01:52:02,312 --> 01:52:05,348
Can't get hold of anybody
since everything is, uh,

1464
01:52:05,382 --> 01:52:06,650
on fire.

1465
01:52:06,683 --> 01:52:09,386
-Dr. Sattler, get some water.
-Oh. Thanks.

1466
01:52:09,419 --> 01:52:11,655
Dr. Grant? Here you are.

1467
01:52:11,688 --> 01:52:13,356
I'm, uh... I'm Owen Grady.

1468
01:52:13,390 --> 01:52:14,959
Big fan. I read your book.

1469
01:52:14,992 --> 01:52:16,693
Well, book on tape.

1470
01:52:16,726 --> 01:52:18,963
Owen Grady, Owen Grady.

1471
01:52:18,996 --> 01:52:21,264
Yeah, I know who you are.

1472
01:52:21,297 --> 01:52:23,934
-You trained raptors.
-Yeah.

1473
01:52:23,968 --> 01:52:26,202
I tried. Yeah.

1474
01:52:26,236 --> 01:52:27,537
How you doing?

1475
01:52:27,570 --> 01:52:29,406
The one here.

1476
01:52:29,439 --> 01:52:31,408
You, uh... you were at
Jurassic World.

1477
01:52:31,441 --> 01:52:32,943
Jurassic World?

1478
01:52:32,977 --> 01:52:35,745
Not a fan. Mm-mm.

1479
01:52:36,646 --> 01:52:39,349
Okay, so we good to find
a way out of here?

1480
01:52:39,382 --> 01:52:40,283
Yep.

1481
01:52:40,316 --> 01:52:41,818
Let's get it.

1482
01:52:41,851 --> 01:52:45,321
There's a helicopter
out in the main complex.

1483
01:52:45,355 --> 01:52:47,657
We turn the ADS back on,
we go home.

1484
01:52:47,691 --> 01:52:50,694
-Wait, what's an ADS?
-Aerial deterrent system.

1485
01:52:50,727 --> 01:52:52,262
Oh, uh...

1486
01:52:52,295 --> 01:52:54,564
You know,
for the pterodactyls and shit.

1487
01:52:54,597 --> 01:52:55,966
Keeps them away
from the helicopters.

1488
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,301
Well, how do we turn it back on?

1489
01:52:58,334 --> 01:52:59,937
Okay, it looks like
all the systems

1490
01:52:59,970 --> 01:53:01,438
run through to the control room,

1491
01:53:01,471 --> 01:53:02,839
which is on the third floor.

1492
01:53:02,872 --> 01:53:04,407
Oh.

1493
01:53:04,441 --> 01:53:06,609
These outposts are all
connected underground.

1494
01:53:11,848 --> 01:53:13,783
All right, easy, Rambo.

1495
01:53:24,061 --> 01:53:26,496
So you worked
in the raptor pen, huh?

1496
01:53:27,330 --> 01:53:29,033
-Yeah.
-Wow, and what-what happens?

1497
01:53:29,066 --> 01:53:31,601
Do you just tell 'em what
to do, and they, uh...

1498
01:53:31,634 --> 01:53:33,737
they comply or...?

1499
01:53:33,770 --> 01:53:37,707
Well, it's a human/animal bond
based on mutual respect.

1500
01:53:37,741 --> 01:53:39,944
Mm-hmm.

1501
01:53:39,977 --> 01:53:42,479
Had a dog once.

1502
01:53:42,512 --> 01:53:46,951
Humped my leg so much, I...
I got a callous on my shinbone.

1503
01:53:46,984 --> 01:53:48,752
That's a true story.

1504
01:54:01,065 --> 01:54:02,766
Oh, God.

1505
01:54:02,799 --> 01:54:05,268
Hey. Good.

1506
01:54:05,936 --> 01:54:07,437
Here's what I'm thinking.

1507
01:54:07,470 --> 01:54:10,373
We get started again,
you and me.

1508
01:54:10,406 --> 01:54:12,675
I can get money.

1509
01:54:13,510 --> 01:54:14,878
Yeah, money's cheap these days.

1510
01:54:14,911 --> 01:54:16,312
What-what's the matter?

1511
01:54:16,346 --> 01:54:18,414
Don't look so worried.
There's...

1512
01:54:18,448 --> 01:54:20,550
There's opportunity
in everything.

1513
01:54:20,583 --> 01:54:22,819
E-Even this.
You'll-you'll learn that.

1514
01:54:22,852 --> 01:54:24,687
I've been thinking, um...

1515
01:54:25,555 --> 01:54:27,423
Maybe you take more
of a lead now, okay?

1516
01:54:27,457 --> 01:54:29,859
You're ready, I think.

1517
01:54:29,893 --> 01:54:31,427
Here, take...

1518
01:54:31,461 --> 01:54:33,496
What the hell is
the matter with you?

1519
01:54:42,605 --> 01:54:43,840
It was you.

1520
01:54:44,841 --> 01:54:47,443
You told Malcolm about
the program. You-you...

1521
01:54:48,145 --> 01:54:51,514
You set this whole thing up?
You set me up?

1522
01:54:51,548 --> 01:54:54,084
I gave you every opportunity
I did not have. I...

1523
01:54:55,585 --> 01:54:58,421
We have an understanding,
Ramsay,

1524
01:54:58,454 --> 01:55:00,590
and you do not break that.

1525
01:55:02,892 --> 01:55:04,861
I would not break this.

1526
01:55:07,831 --> 01:55:09,599
I'm not you.

1527
01:55:24,014 --> 01:55:26,516
Oh, this is very bad.

1528
01:55:27,750 --> 01:55:29,987
This is the same system
we used at the park.

1529
01:55:30,020 --> 01:55:32,689
Great, so we can, uh,
turn on the...

1530
01:55:32,722 --> 01:55:34,924
the thing, and then we all
get out of here?

1531
01:55:34,959 --> 01:55:36,893
Let's see. ADS...

1532
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:40,463
What's this?
What-what's error 99?

1533
01:55:40,496 --> 01:55:41,831
Not enough power.

1534
01:55:41,865 --> 01:55:44,134
In a breakdown,
all available power is seized

1535
01:55:44,168 --> 01:55:46,170
by the primary system
to keep running.

1536
01:55:46,203 --> 01:55:48,005
We need all that power
to reactivate the ADS.

1537
01:55:48,038 --> 01:55:50,473
So the system's safety feature
is what's gonna kill us?

1538
01:55:50,506 --> 01:55:52,709
-Of course.
-How do we get more power?

1539
01:55:52,742 --> 01:55:54,878
Uh, well, we can't, but we can
redistribute what we have

1540
01:55:54,911 --> 01:55:56,479
if we just... just need to...

1541
01:55:56,512 --> 01:55:57,747
Shut down the primary system.

1542
01:55:57,780 --> 01:55:59,515
-Yes, exactly.
-Where is it?

1543
01:55:59,549 --> 01:56:01,118
-Uh, next floor up.
-I'm coming with you.

1544
01:56:01,151 --> 01:56:02,785
We escaped down here.

1545
01:56:03,686 --> 01:56:05,155
Where is that?
Water treatment center.

1546
01:56:05,189 --> 01:56:07,490
Hydroelectric system--
sub eight.

1547
01:56:07,523 --> 01:56:09,159
Give me eight minutes,
I could find her.

1548
01:56:09,193 --> 01:56:11,527
-Wait, who's this now?
-Beta.

1549
01:56:11,561 --> 01:56:13,529
-Blue's baby.
-Velociraptor.

1550
01:56:13,563 --> 01:56:15,665
-What?
-A baby raptor?

1551
01:56:15,698 --> 01:56:17,500
And you gave her a name.
How about that?

1552
01:56:17,533 --> 01:56:19,435
I made a promise
we would bring her home.

1553
01:56:19,469 --> 01:56:22,438
You made a promise
to a dinosaur.

1554
01:56:22,472 --> 01:56:24,041
You're coming with us, right?

1555
01:56:24,074 --> 01:56:25,842
Maisie, I...

1556
01:56:25,875 --> 01:56:26,944
Please.

1557
01:56:29,846 --> 01:56:31,181
I'll be on channel five.

1558
01:56:31,215 --> 01:56:32,916
-Okay.
-We're on three.

1559
01:56:34,684 --> 01:56:35,953
Come back.

1560
01:56:36,954 --> 01:56:38,421
I always come back.

1561
01:56:39,589 --> 01:56:42,425
I'll have that chopper hot
in ten. Wait for my signal.

1562
01:56:43,793 --> 01:56:46,196
Evacuation phase four complete.

1563
01:56:46,230 --> 01:56:48,698
All living assets
now in containment.

1564
01:56:57,241 --> 01:56:58,708
Come on.

1565
01:57:10,753 --> 01:57:12,755
Still get nightmares?

1566
01:57:12,789 --> 01:57:14,992
All the time.

1567
01:57:15,025 --> 01:57:16,693
You?

1568
01:57:17,527 --> 01:57:19,229
I have a lot of regrets.

1569
01:57:19,263 --> 01:57:20,897
Oh, yeah?

1570
01:57:22,032 --> 01:57:23,700
Well...

1571
01:57:23,733 --> 01:57:27,570
we hold on to regret,
we stay in the past.

1572
01:57:30,307 --> 01:57:32,675
What matters, I guess, is...

1573
01:57:33,910 --> 01:57:35,712
...is what we do now.

1574
01:57:35,745 --> 01:57:36,879
Right?

1575
01:57:36,913 --> 01:57:38,082
Yeah.

1576
01:57:55,332 --> 01:57:57,700
Nobody said there'd be bugs.

1577
01:57:59,303 --> 01:58:02,139
B4. She's in here.

1578
01:58:02,172 --> 01:58:04,141
Watch the sides.

1579
01:58:04,174 --> 01:58:06,876
They always come from the sides.

1580
01:58:08,178 --> 01:58:11,315
You know, at first we thought...

1581
01:58:11,348 --> 01:58:14,985
they disembowel their prey,
but no.

1582
01:58:15,019 --> 01:58:18,554
They're smart enough to go
straight for the throat.

1583
01:58:18,588 --> 01:58:20,923
The veins, the arteries.

1584
01:58:21,791 --> 01:58:23,626
Sometimes both at the same time.

1585
01:58:23,659 --> 01:58:25,029
Okay.

1586
01:58:25,062 --> 01:58:27,563
Oh, okay.

1587
01:58:27,597 --> 01:58:28,698
We've got you.

1588
01:58:28,731 --> 01:58:30,167
It's right down that aisle.

1589
01:58:30,200 --> 01:58:32,568
-It's right down that aisle
where you are. -

1590
01:58:32,602 --> 01:58:34,171
Why are they skulking in-in...

1591
01:58:34,204 --> 01:58:35,305
You can sprint right for it.

1592
01:58:35,339 --> 01:58:37,840
Okay. Here it is.

1593
01:58:37,874 --> 01:58:39,943
Okay, so it-it'll be a yellow
button on a grid of six.

1594
01:58:39,977 --> 01:58:42,312
There's a green button.
Do you see a green button?

1595
01:58:42,346 --> 01:58:43,713
It's not that green button.

1596
01:58:43,746 --> 01:58:44,948
-It's four...
-which one's the button?

1597
01:58:44,982 --> 01:58:45,748
Four from the bottom.

1598
01:58:45,782 --> 01:58:47,184
-Above the...
-Whoa, whoa.

1599
01:58:47,217 --> 01:58:48,718
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Fourth one up?

1600
01:58:48,751 --> 01:58:50,220
Third one down
or fourth one up--same thing.

1601
01:58:50,254 --> 01:58:51,821
Ian, be specific.

1602
01:58:56,393 --> 01:58:58,128
She was here.

1603
01:58:58,162 --> 01:58:59,997
Lights off.

1604
01:59:06,103 --> 01:59:08,205
I don't know how I could
possibly be more specific

1605
01:59:08,238 --> 01:59:11,241
other than to say that the one
you want is marked with...

1606
01:59:11,275 --> 01:59:13,077
-E1.
-E1. E1.

1607
01:59:13,110 --> 01:59:15,845
E1.

1608
01:59:16,846 --> 01:59:19,149
Yeah.

1609
01:59:23,120 --> 01:59:25,621
No. No, no, no, no.

1610
01:59:31,195 --> 01:59:33,964
Damn it, she's fast.

1611
01:59:36,333 --> 01:59:37,334
Hey.

1612
01:59:38,435 --> 01:59:40,070
Eyes on me.

1613
01:59:43,739 --> 01:59:46,776
I've got to hit her
on the side of her neck.

1614
01:59:46,809 --> 01:59:49,146
Maisie, you're gonna
hold her focus.

1615
01:59:49,179 --> 01:59:52,082
Grant, we're triangulating.

1616
01:59:57,988 --> 01:59:59,089
Go.

1617
02:00:27,850 --> 02:00:29,652
Sorry, girl.

1618
02:00:30,387 --> 02:00:32,755
I promised your mom
I'd get you home.

1619
02:00:33,756 --> 02:00:35,758
Primary system rebooting.

1620
02:00:35,791 --> 02:00:36,926
Wait. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1621
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:38,162
-No, no, no.
-No, no, no.

1622
02:00:38,195 --> 02:00:39,296
It's rebooting.

1623
02:00:39,329 --> 02:00:40,430
No, it shouldn't be doing that.

1624
02:00:52,342 --> 02:00:54,077
Here, take this.

1625
02:01:09,926 --> 02:01:11,228
-We got to stay on it.
-Ian, shut it down!

1626
02:01:11,261 --> 02:01:12,795
We're-we're gonna make it work.

1627
02:01:12,828 --> 02:01:13,896
We're gonna figure this out.
It's very complex.

1628
02:01:13,930 --> 02:01:15,999
We don't have time for complex!

1629
02:01:20,836 --> 02:01:22,838
Primary system compromised.

1630
02:01:25,409 --> 02:01:26,909
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1631
02:01:26,944 --> 02:01:28,212
Aerial deterrent system active.

1632
02:01:28,245 --> 02:01:29,812
Victory! Victory!

1633
02:01:33,383 --> 02:01:35,252
Damn, that felt good.

1634
02:02:03,146 --> 02:02:06,083
Oh, come on!

1635
02:02:57,200 --> 02:02:59,036
What's your story?

1636
02:03:02,606 --> 02:03:04,308
Wait!

1637
02:03:14,217 --> 02:03:16,420
At Biosyn, we're dedicated

1638
02:03:16,453 --> 02:03:18,555
to the idea that dinosaurs

1639
02:03:18,588 --> 02:03:21,258
can teach us more
about ourselves.

1640
02:03:25,495 --> 02:03:28,398
All right,
Kayla, we're good to go.

1641
02:03:38,475 --> 02:03:40,243
Okay, cutie.

1642
02:03:45,682 --> 02:03:48,952
Oh, come here. Oh.

1643
02:03:48,985 --> 02:03:50,187
-You all right?
-Someday.

1644
02:03:50,220 --> 02:03:51,088
Okay.

1645
02:03:51,121 --> 02:03:53,156
Hey.

1646
02:04:00,397 --> 02:04:01,531
I remember you.

1647
02:04:01,565 --> 02:04:03,667
Please, you have
to listen to me.

1648
02:04:03,700 --> 02:04:05,669
You created
an ecological disaster.

1649
02:04:05,702 --> 02:04:07,304
And I can fix it.

1650
02:04:08,305 --> 02:04:11,975
Charlotte Lockwood changed
every cell in Maisie's body.

1651
02:04:12,008 --> 02:04:13,510
It saved her life.

1652
02:04:13,543 --> 02:04:17,514
If I can understand how
Charlotte rewrote Maisie's DNA,

1653
02:04:17,547 --> 02:04:20,517
I can spread change from
one locust to the entire swarm

1654
02:04:20,550 --> 02:04:22,885
before it's too late.

1655
02:04:24,421 --> 02:04:27,391
It's okay. It's okay.

1656
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:32,928
It's what she would have wanted.

1657
02:04:35,532 --> 02:04:37,200
Thank you.

1658
02:04:37,234 --> 02:04:38,602
No, no, no.

1659
02:04:38,635 --> 02:04:40,504
No, no, no, no, no.

1660
02:04:40,537 --> 02:04:42,406
Him?

1661
02:04:42,439 --> 02:04:43,673
Not him.

1662
02:04:43,707 --> 02:04:45,409
Not him. It's always him.

1663
02:04:45,442 --> 02:04:47,544
Every si...

1664
02:04:47,577 --> 02:04:50,113
Is that a dinosaur
on your shoulder?

1665
02:04:50,714 --> 02:04:52,915
Yeah. Why?

1666
02:04:53,550 --> 02:04:55,485
I have air.
Meet me at the center.

1667
02:04:55,519 --> 02:04:57,554
No, no, no, no, no, no.
W-Wait, wait, wait. Hey, hey.

1668
02:04:57,587 --> 02:04:59,322
D-Do... do not land in here.

1669
02:04:59,356 --> 02:05:01,024
I don't have a choice, dude.
The valley isn't safe.

1670
02:05:01,057 --> 02:05:03,393
No, they're not
in the valley anymore!

1671
02:05:04,461 --> 02:05:06,029
Oh!

1672
02:06:35,652 --> 02:06:36,686
This isn't about us.

1673
02:07:02,846 --> 02:07:04,648
Run!

1674
02:07:08,151 --> 02:07:09,819
Oh, my God!
Get him up, get him up!

1675
02:07:09,853 --> 02:07:12,155
-Come on, come on!
-Come on.

1676
02:07:15,158 --> 02:07:16,593
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1677
02:07:20,764 --> 02:07:22,299
Come on!

1678
02:07:35,912 --> 02:07:37,647
Ellie, no!

1679
02:08:06,910 --> 02:08:08,645
Go on, Maisie! Go!

1680
02:08:10,447 --> 02:08:11,848
-Ramsay, get in.
-You're in.

1681
02:08:11,881 --> 02:08:14,117
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1682
02:08:17,887 --> 02:08:20,390
Everybody hold on to somebody.

1683
02:09:41,404 --> 02:09:43,206
Ow.

1684
02:09:44,607 --> 02:09:46,309
No, at every level.

1685
02:09:46,342 --> 02:09:48,812
Complete systemic corruption
in-in the executive ranks.

1686
02:09:48,845 --> 02:09:51,347
"Systemic corruption."
You get that? Write that down.

1687
02:09:52,749 --> 02:09:53,984
Yeah, it's crazy.

1688
02:09:54,018 --> 02:09:56,319
Oh, and then...
and then we crashed

1689
02:09:56,352 --> 02:09:57,721
into this ice lake, right?

1690
02:09:57,754 --> 02:09:59,656
I mean, they literally
owe me a plane.

1691
02:09:59,689 --> 02:10:02,525
I need to get this sample
vetted at the lab

1692
02:10:02,559 --> 02:10:05,495
before I take it
to my contact at <i>The Times.</i>

1693
02:10:07,064 --> 02:10:09,766
You could, uh, come with me.

1694
02:10:11,035 --> 02:10:13,803
Unless you need
to get back to your dig.

1695
02:10:16,339 --> 02:10:18,608
-Ellie.
-Yeah?

1696
02:10:20,510 --> 02:10:22,645
I am coming with you.

1697
02:10:32,522 --> 02:10:33,991
I know.

1698
02:10:34,024 --> 02:10:35,425
One more minute,

1699
02:10:35,458 --> 02:10:37,560
then we'll send you home
with your folks.

1700
02:11:16,366 --> 02:11:18,635
<i>Today marks</i>
<i>the first day of testimony</i>

1706
02:11:31,115 --> 02:11:32,983
You look...

1707
02:11:33,017 --> 02:11:35,318
-Uncomfortable.
-Trustworthy.

1708
02:11:39,856 --> 02:11:42,692
Yeah. Not getting used to it.

1709
02:11:44,460 --> 02:11:46,529
Let's finish this.

1710
02:11:46,563 --> 02:11:47,664
Yeah.

1711
02:11:51,734 --> 02:11:53,536
<i>Dr. Henry Wu has found</i>

1712
02:11:53,570 --> 02:11:56,539
<i>an emergency solution</i>
<i>to the ecological crisis.</i>

-Money?
-Money.

1722
02:12:52,662 --> 02:12:54,430
Thank you.

1723
02:14:57,054 --> 02:15:01,158
Life on Earth has existed for
hundreds of millions of years.

1724
02:15:02,092 --> 02:15:04,827
And dinosaurs were only
a part of that,

1725
02:15:04,861 --> 02:15:07,630
and we're an even smaller
part of that.

1726
02:15:07,663 --> 02:15:10,134
They really put us
in perspective.

1727
02:15:11,168 --> 02:15:13,270
<i>The idea that life on Earth</i>

1728
02:15:13,303 --> 02:15:15,671
<i>existed 65 million years ago...</i>

1729

...it's humbling.

1730
02:15:19,675 --> 02:15:21,911
We act like we're alone here,
but we're not.

1731
02:15:21,945 --> 02:15:25,983
<i>We're part of a fragile system</i>
<i>made up of all living things.</i>

1732
02:15:27,084 --> 02:15:31,055

<i>we'll have to trust each other,</i>

1733
02:15:31,088 --> 02:15:33,190
<i>depend on each other,</i>

1734
