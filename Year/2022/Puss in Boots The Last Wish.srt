Good to see you again.

19
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:41,119
Papa! He stepped on my face!

20
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,539
And we will never wash it again.

Okay, okay. One more number.

97
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,977
I call this one
"The Legend Will Never Die."

98
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,106
Puss in Boots!

99
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,319
Puss.

100
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,029
Puss?

101
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,822
Puss in Boots?

102
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,872
Where... Where am I?

103
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:01,333
Not to worry.
You're in good hands.

104
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,751
My hands!

105
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:05,045
I am the village doctor.

106
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:08,382
I am also the village barber,
veterinarian, dentist and witch-finder.

107
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,511
And in my professional opinion…

108
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,889
…you need a wash, a blow out
and a little trim around the hindquarters.

109
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,433
- Uh…
- That's my professional barber opinion.

110
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:23,355
But putting on my doctor's hat,
I think we need to run a few tests.

111
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:26,984
All right. Reflexes.

112
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,652
Cat-like. Temperature.

113
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,988
Now lift your tail and relax.

114
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:34,741
Trust me. I run hot. Yep.

115
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:38,287
Then how about the latest
in modern medical technology?

116
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,540
Leeches!
To draw out the evil humors.

117
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,168
Suit yourself. More for me.

118
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,753
Uh, listen, Doctor.

119
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:49,423
Thanks for everything,
but I am feeling great.

120
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,717
Strong, like a bull! You know?

121
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,387
Now, do you know a good place
to get some gazpacho?

122
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,264
Please. This is serious.

123
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,599
What is it?

124
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:01,435
Puss in Boots, how do I say this?

125
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,271
You died.

126
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,567
Doctor, please.

127
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:12,362
Relax! I am Puss in Boots.

128
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,198
I laugh at death!

129
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,450
You see?

130
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:20,245
And anyway, I am a cat.
I have nine lives.

131
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,414
And how many times
have you died already?

132
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:26,502
Uh… I don't know. I never counted.

133
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:29,505
- I am not really a math guy, you know?
- <i>Gato!</i>

134
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:33,008
Take it easy, Doctor. Let's see…

135
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,594
There was the running of the bulls
in Pamplona.

136
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,098
<i>Hola, señorita.</i>

137
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,642
Do you like gazpacho?

138
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,271
Guess it's not your night, huh, fellas?

139
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:53,570
I am telling you,
a cat always lands on his feet!

140
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:54,655
Watch!

141
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,453
No! Puss in Boots doesn't need a spotter.

142
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:02,538
Watch!

143
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,752
No need to pull into port.
This will revolutionize travel.

144
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:09,962
Watch!

145
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,591
Uh, excuse me,
does this have shellfish in it?

146
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,009
Yes, sir.

147
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:16,969
Meh!

148
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,931
Puss, I think you set
the oven too high!

149
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,268
- I am a master of the baking. Watch!
- Whoa!

150
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,646
And then there was the giant today.

151
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:32,234
So what is that? Like, uh, four?

152
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,154
That makes eight, Puss.
You are down to your last life.

153
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,366
My prescription,
no more adventures for you.

154
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,701
You need to retire.

155
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,661
Me? Retire?

156
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:44,538
Are you the village comedian as well?

157
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,624
Puss. Is there any safe place you can go?

158
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,627
Any special someone you can rely on
in this moment of need?

159
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:55,674
I am Puss in Boots,
loved by one and all.

160
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,342
Anyone in particular?

161
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:01,430
I mean, how could I possibly choose?

162
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:05,225
Mm-hmm.
This is the address of Mama Luna.

163
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:08,812
She is a cat fancier,
always on the lookout for a new lap-cat.

164
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:09,980
You will be safe there.

165
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,148
Lap-cat?

166
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:13,108
I am no lap-cat, Doctor.

167
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,402
I am Puss in Boots!

168
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,904
Not anymore.

169
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:20,199
Barber's orders.
I mean, doctor's orders.

170
00:12:20,991 --> 00:12:22,201
And remember, Puss.

171
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:26,330
Death comes for us all. Treat?

172
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,708
You really got to work on
your bedside manner.

173
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:45,516
Ha! I am Puss in Boots!
I am no one's lap-cat.

174
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:49,603
That doctor is a quack and a crazy man.

175
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,480
He should stick to cutting hair.

176
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,190
Last call, <i>Señor Boots.</i>

177
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:56,193
Another glass of cream.
Make it your heaviest.

178
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,362
Oh! I keep the heavy stuff in the back.

179
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:05,077
Huh! Retire.

180
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,663
You are too good-looking to retire.

181
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,096
Well, well, if it isn't
Puss in Boots himself.

182
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,391
In the flesh.

183
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,143
Uh, hey.

184
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,980
There's the famous hat.

185
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,147
The feather.

186
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,984
And of course, the boots.

187
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:41,530
My compliments to your cobbler.

188
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:46,159
Thanks. Good to meet you too.

189
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:52,708
Hey, I never do this,
but can I get your autograph?

190
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:56,211
Been following you for a long time.

191
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,256
Sign right there.

192
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:06,221
Puss in Boots
laughs in the face of death,

193
00:14:06,305 --> 00:14:07,514
bounty hunter.

194
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,600
So I've heard.

195
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:13,228
You will find
your reward does not come easily,

196
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:14,855
this I tell you.

197
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:19,193
Everyone thinks they'll be the one
to defeat me,

198
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,528
but no one's escaped me yet.

199
00:14:22,863 --> 00:14:24,907
All right, let's get it over with.

200
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,825
Fear me, if you dare…

201
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,418
Okay, no more messing around. Huh!

202
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:43,300
Slow. Sloppy. Sad.

203
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,313
Yow!

204
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,941
You're not living up to the legend, <i>gato</i>.

205
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:36,645
I just love the smell of fear.

206
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,908
What's the matter?

207
00:15:49,992 --> 00:15:52,786
Lives flashing before your eyes?

208
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,331
Pick it up.

209
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,919
Pick… it… up.

210
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:28,006
I am no longer worthy.

211
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:29,550
I'm sorry.

212
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,270
We are gathered here today
to say goodbye

213
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:44,189

214
00:17:44,273 --> 00:17:47,568
There are no words
to express such a loss.

215
00:17:48,694 --> 00:17:49,695
Thank you.

216
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,493
But it would be a crime not to try.

Pickles? Is that your name?

Me, I don't have a name.
Or a home.

285
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,300
So, I'm no expert,
but you don't look like a "Pickles."

286
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:06,553
Well, you don't look like a cat.

287
00:23:06,637 --> 00:23:09,139
Okay, okay, okay. Full disclosure.

288
00:23:09,223 --> 00:23:10,891
I'm not a cat. I'm a dog.

Hi, Bon Bon.

00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,357
Oh! Pickles has a new girlfriend? Okay.

292
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,360
I live under the porch.
It can get a little lonely down there.

293
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,320
It's mostly controlled
by the rats and the centipedes,

295

Congratulations.

296
00:23:26,198 --> 00:23:28,408
I just come up here
for the food and the friends.

297
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:30,911
Mostly... Mostly the food.

298
00:23:30,994 --> 00:23:33,163
Please don't tell anyone. I need this.

299
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:35,123
I won't tell. I don't care.

300
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:38,293
So you'll keep my secret?
A secret between friends?

301
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:39,753
Just a secret.

302
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:42,714
It's funny.
Despite all this best friend bonding,

303
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:44,508
you're still a mystery to me, Pickles.

304
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:45,759
What's your story?

305
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:47,719
My story…

306
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,431

308
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:56,103
Oh, no.

309
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:57,729
Wanna rub my belly?

310
00:23:59,231 --> 00:24:00,065
Hmm?

311
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,650
What… What's happening?

312
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:03,527
- Rub.
- Hard pass.

313
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:05,654
Come on, rub. I need the practice.

314
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:07,489
I'm gonna be a therapy dog someday.

315
00:24:07,573 --> 00:24:08,949
What the hell are you talking about?

316
00:24:09,032 --> 00:24:10,200
I'm glad you asked.

317

they can rub my belly.

318
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:13,912
It'll make 'em feel better.

319
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:14,997
- Rub my belly.
- No.

320
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,582
- Come on! Rub it.
- No. Not happening.

321
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:17,499
- Rub it!
- No!

322
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:21,670
Let me be clear.
I don't want to touch your belly, okay?

323
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:24,256
Okeydoke. So, what do you want?

324
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:27,426
I want to be left alone.

325
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:50,199

326
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:51,825
Oh, I never left.

00:25:24,775 --> 00:25:27,569
What could they possibly
want to offer Puss in Boots?

332
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:28,862

333

there are no cats here!

337
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:41,458

the legendary Puss in Boots.

338
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:43,877
Have you perhaps… seen him?

339
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:45,128

I'll be outside.

360
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:49,151
My cats can play better than you!

361
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:50,944
♪ <i>So roll out the barrels</i> ♪

362
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:52,404
Goldi, is this him?

363
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,573
That's a dog in a cat costume.

364
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:56,283
Oh, yeah.

365
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:57,743
Tricky little bugger.

366
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,411
How about this one? He's a ginger.

367
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:03,207
Is that a joke?

368
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,376
You think this scruffy,
geriatric bag of bones

369
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,794
looks like a legend?

370
00:27:07,878 --> 00:27:09,379
This is definitely not…

371
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:11,715
Puss in Boots! I found him!

372
00:27:12,966 --> 00:27:15,886
Puss in Boots, dead and buried.

373
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,263
Dead? No, no, no. He can't be.

374
00:27:18,347 --> 00:27:21,475
Yep. The nose never lies.

375
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:22,893
Well, that's that, then.

376
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:24,561
What say we go
and hibernate, eh?

377
00:27:24,645 --> 00:27:25,729
No!

378
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:29,274
The map is being delivered tonight
and we have one chance to steal it.

379
00:27:29,358 --> 00:27:31,527
Without it,
we'll never find the Wishing Star.

380
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,197
The Wishing Star. It does exist.

381
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,407
That star has one wish to grant.

382
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:38,784
One wish?

383
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:40,869
Think of what that could mean for us.

384
00:27:40,953 --> 00:27:43,330
Nine lives! Yes!

385
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:46,834
Well, I don't see why we needed
to hire Puss in Boots in the first place.

386
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:50,504
Ugh. Because nobody steals
from Big Jack Horner.

387
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,965
No! Not Jack Horner.

388
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:55,801
Don't worry, love.
We'll get that wish somehow.

389
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:56,969
Thank you, Mama.

390
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:59,638
Yeah. Because I've got a plan.

391
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,849
I can nick a map
as good as any old cat.

392
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:05,394
You've got a plan?

393
00:28:05,477 --> 00:28:07,688
What? I'm smart, ain't I?
Ain't I, Papa?

394
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:11,358
No. You ain't well fixed for brains.

395
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:15,028
- Robbing Big Jack Horner.
- Very risky.

396
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:18,282
But that wish could get me my lives back.

397
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:19,908
And my life back!

398
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:21,702
Goodbye, Pickles!

399
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:23,495
Oh, no, Pickles, you're leaving?

400
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:25,414
<i>Perro</i>, start digging.

401
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:26,540
Okay.

402
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:29,376
But if this Puss in Boots
is such a big deal,

403
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:31,086
maybe we shouldn't be
desecrating his grave.

404
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:33,589
I don't think he would mind

405
00:28:33,672 --> 00:28:35,215
because he…

406
00:28:37,426 --> 00:28:38,969
is me!

407
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:42,764
Oh! Okay.

408
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:44,600
Oh, yeah. Uh…

409
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:48,145
Normally, I have a sword.
It's like a whole thing, you know.

410
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:50,105
Pickles, you're Puss in Boots?

411
00:28:50,189 --> 00:28:51,940
Not yet! But I will be.

412
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:54,109
I'll come… I'll come with you.

413
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:55,194
Sorry, <i>Perro</i>.

414
00:28:55,277 --> 00:28:57,404
Puss in Boots walks alone!

415
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:06,496
Open the gates!

416
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:22,971
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hands off the merchandise. We got this.

417
00:29:23,055 --> 00:29:26,225
Okay. Just get in and get out. Easy peasy.

418
00:29:26,308 --> 00:29:27,976
Lemon squeezy.

419
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,811
What are you doing here?

420
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:31,188
I brought you a sword.

421
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,315
That's not a sword. That's a stick.

422
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:34,566
It's a stick-sword.

423
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,651
Go home.

424
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,152
My home is where my friends are.

425
00:29:37,236 --> 00:29:38,862
Again. Not friends.

426
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:42,449
- Rub for luck?
- I don't need luck for this.

427
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,701
I am a highly skilled, master cat thief.

428
00:29:44,785 --> 00:29:45,786
Watch!

429
00:29:46,662 --> 00:29:49,581
Mm-hmm.

430
00:29:49,665 --> 00:29:50,791
You got this.

431
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:09,309
Mmm.

432
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:11,979
I pronounce this batch…

433
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:13,814
delicious.

434
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:18,277
Ship 'em out!

435
00:30:20,112 --> 00:30:21,947
Mr. Horner.

436
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,449
The Serpent Sisters got the goods.

437
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:28,537
Is it? Is it the map to the Wishing Star?

438
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,873
Stop everything. You two, come with me.

439
00:30:30,956 --> 00:30:33,125
We must get this to the trophy room.

440
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:36,712
You know, it took a lot of murdering
to get this map.

441
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:37,880
It all started…

442
00:30:37,963 --> 00:30:39,756
Take it to the trophy room!

443
00:30:50,184 --> 00:30:52,936
What the…

444
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,273
Wow. Look at all the magic stuff.

445
00:30:56,356 --> 00:30:59,568
Yes, I collect enchanted objects,
magical icons,

446
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:02,779
bobbles, and geegaws,
and la-di-da and blah blah blah.

447
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:05,699
Check it out!
I'm walking on a magic carpet.

448
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:09,161
Sweet.
The shrunken ship of the Lilliputians.

449
00:31:09,244 --> 00:31:12,456
Shut up! Are those unicorn horns?

450
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,124
Baby unicorn horns.

451
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:16,376
Half as heavy, twice as sharp.

452
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,586
Savage.

453
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:19,129
Ah! They're trinkets!

454
00:31:19,213 --> 00:31:22,883
They're nothing compared to the awesome
power of the magic Wishing Star.

455
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:24,843
Speaking of which,
make with the box, Sister.

456
00:31:24,927 --> 00:31:26,094
You got it, boss.

457
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:29,723
Like I was saying,
the amount of murdering we…

458
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,808
Make with the box!

459
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:37,689
After so many years of searching,
this is my moment.

460
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,069
With this wish, I will finally be

461
00:31:42,152 --> 00:31:44,696
the master of all magic!

462
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,031
Hey, Little Jack?

463
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,744
- Excuse me?
- Could you do the thumb thing?

464
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,496
- Shh!
- Like in the fairy tale?

465
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:55,749
It wasn't a fairy tale!
It was only a nursery rhyme.

466
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:58,168

Little Jack Horner didn't have any magic.

476

He was a pathetic,

I'm Big Jack Horner.

Ah! Mr. Big Jack Horner, sir…

479
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,543
I barely know her.

- Puss?
- Kitty?

484
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:55,184
- Puss.
- Kitty!

485
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,773
This is my job!

No, this is my job.
I'm double-crossing the Bears.

No, I'm double-crossing the Bears.

488
00:33:06,361 --> 00:33:08,447
They tried to hire me earlier today.

489
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,324
Well, they tried to hire me two weeks ago.

490
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:12,326
That makes you plan B.

491
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:13,660
Aha!

492
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:15,204
There it is!

00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:16,163
Phew!

494
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:18,457
Now, about your payment…

495
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,877
Hold up. You promised us
our weight in gold.

496
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,212
I did, didn't I?

497
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:25,339
Ever hear of the Midas Touch?

498
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:27,674
Ah, cool, dibs!

499
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:31,220
Oh, no! I misjudged the situation!

500
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:34,348
This is why
you don't cross Jack Horner.

501
00:33:34,431 --> 00:33:37,184
- What is this? Are you a pirate now?
- Shh.

502
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:39,937
It's like a possum crawled
on your face and died.

503
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,021
Shh.

504
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:42,105
Of shame.

505
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:43,857
Please, mock me quietly.

506
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:45,609
I hate it. It's disgusting.

507
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:48,153
Well, I love it. It's distinguished.

508
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,748
Great plan, Baby. Real cat-like.

509
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:08,172
Uh… Can I… go?

510
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:09,925
Pleasure doing, uh…

511
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:14,263
- Puss in Boots?
- Goldi. Bears.

512
00:34:14,346 --> 00:34:15,556
Hola, Jack.

513
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,474
Kitty Softpaws.

514
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:20,811
My, you have a lot of nerve
coming back here.

515
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:23,188
Please.
I was the best thief you ever hired.

516
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:24,188
You robbed me!

517
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:25,357
You set me up.

518
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,110
You said you were going on
some spiritual retreat.

519
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:29,194
Namaste.

520
00:34:29,277 --> 00:34:31,237
And you're supposed to be dead.

521
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:32,364
I got better?

522
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:33,657
Ugh! Just give us the map.

523
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,367
And throw in a dozen pies.

524
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,119
- Ooh! Have you got any savory pies?
- What?

525
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:38,620
- Yeah, what flavors you got?
- No!

526
00:34:38,704 --> 00:34:40,246
Can we get all of that in a bag to go?

527
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:43,041
Ah! Would you stop talking
about blooming pies!

528
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:44,333
Focus!

529
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:47,129
Hand over that map,
or I'll punch holes in the lot of ya.

530
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:49,755
Oh, bums.

531
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,425
Look out! It's coming down!

532
00:34:55,262 --> 00:35:00,809
Ha! I hate talking fairy-tale animals.

533
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:05,898
Puss, get back here!

534
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:07,733
The best thief has won.

535
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:10,027
- Huh?
- You're right.

536
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,486
She did.

537
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,654
Oh, come on!

538
00:35:14,156 --> 00:35:15,741
There! They're getting away!

539
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,877
Ooh!

540
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,670
No, no, no, no, no, no!

541
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:32,382
Nice catching up with you, Puss!

542
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:33,467
Gotta go!

543
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:37,262
Here, kitty-kitty.

544
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:41,850
Is that a stick?
What are you gonna do with that? Ow!

545
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,227
Ow! Me knuckles!

546
00:35:44,478 --> 00:35:46,021
You shouldn't have done that, mate.

547
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:47,064
Heh.

548
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:50,484
This idiot.

549
00:35:56,448 --> 00:35:58,200
Hey, Puss! I found a sandwich in here.

550
00:35:58,283 --> 00:35:59,660
- I think it's tuna fish.
- Drive, <i>Perro</i>!

551
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:00,577
Okeydoke.

552
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:11,505
Oh, cool! Another member of the team!

553
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:14,007
- We are not a team!
- Eyes on the road!

554
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:15,092
Who is this guy?

555
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:17,344
- I'm Puss's best friend.
- No! He isn't.

556
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:19,930
- And his therapy dog.
- Definitely not!

557
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:22,182
Finally! You need therapy.

558
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:26,854
Give me the map. Trust me.

559
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:29,857
Trust you? Like I did in Santa Coloma?

560
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,066
Really? Santa Coloma?

561
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:33,193
<i>Sí</i>, Santa Coloma!

562
00:36:37,155 --> 00:36:38,156
- Mine!
- Mine!

563
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,283
- Mine!
- Mine!

564
00:36:55,215 --> 00:37:00,095
Good people, accept this golden gift
from Puss in Boots!

565
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:14,276
Speed up! Go, go, go!

566
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,241
Assemble the Baker's Dozen.

567
00:37:22,326 --> 00:37:24,328
Careful with this.

568
00:37:24,411 --> 00:37:27,456
I'll take this and that, oh, and these!

569
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:29,249
One of those, and I gotta take that.

570
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,210
Yes. Yes. No.

571
00:37:31,293 --> 00:37:32,503
Yes!

572
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:33,504
Oh, yeah!

573
00:37:36,673 --> 00:37:38,258
And all of these!

574
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:40,802
This one is right.

575
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:58,987
I'll get you, my kitties,
and your little dog too.

576
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:05,536
What?

577
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:08,372
This is blank. We've been ripped off!

578
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:09,748
Where is the…

579
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:12,918
Oh. Yeah.
I knew it was gonna do that.

580
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:15,838
"The Dark Forest is deep and far.

581
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:18,507
Within its bounds, you'll find the star."

582
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:23,512
Ugh. The Dark Forest?
No one goes into the Dark Forest.

583
00:38:23,595 --> 00:38:24,847
Or comes out.

584
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:27,975
"A single wish burns true and bright.

585
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:30,853
This map's the key, so hold on tight."

586
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:35,190
You let go!

587
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:38,360
A stick?
What happened to your sword?

588
00:38:38,443 --> 00:38:41,530
Got rid of it, you know.
Made things too easy.

589
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:42,823
I needed a challenge.

590
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:45,075
Yeah.
You looked pretty challenged back there.

591
00:38:45,158 --> 00:38:48,328
There's no way
I'm letting you hold the map!

592
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:50,998
Well, there's no way
I'm letting you hold the map!

593
00:38:51,081 --> 00:38:52,082
I can hold it.

594
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:56,295
Yeah, right. What's your deal anyway?

595
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:57,754
You run with the Chihuahua Gang?

596
00:38:57,838 --> 00:38:59,131
I don't think so.

597
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:00,215
I don't believe you.

598
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:03,343
That's okay.
As long as you believe in yourself.

599
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:06,763
What? Is he deranged?

600
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:08,515
- Yep.
- What's your name?

601
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:10,642
Oh. I've been called all kinds of things.

602
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:13,645
Dog. Bad Dog. Stupid Dog.
Hey You! You There!

603
00:39:13,729 --> 00:39:15,397
Get Out! Leave It! Drop It!

604
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,732
Big Rat. Small Pig.

605
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:19,276
Rat Face. Butt Nugget. for Brains.

606
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,153
You know, that sort of thing.

607
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:23,614
But I've never had a name
that really stuck, you know?

608
00:39:24,198 --> 00:39:25,574
That belonged to me.

609
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:26,992
Is he done?

610
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:28,035
And you are?

611
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:31,121
Softpaws. Kitty Softpaws.

612
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:33,707
Wow! Yeah. Now, that's a good name.

613
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,250
There's music in a name like that.

614
00:39:35,334 --> 00:39:37,753
Kitty Softpaws.

615
00:39:37,836 --> 00:39:40,589
Nice try. Classic con.

616
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:41,673
No one's that dumb.

617
00:39:41,757 --> 00:39:43,175
No one's that nice.

618
00:39:43,258 --> 00:39:44,301
I don't trust you.

619
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,803
Me neither. He cannot be trusted.

620
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:50,224
But I trust him more than I trust you.

621
00:39:50,307 --> 00:39:53,435
Wow. This trip is going to be fun.

622
00:40:26,844 --> 00:40:29,763
This must be the Dark Forest.

623
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:43,068
- Oh, my God!
- It's gone!

624
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:44,528
It's back!

625
00:40:44,611 --> 00:40:47,030
Nothing to worry about.

626
00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:50,200
We step through as one.

627
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:53,245
Ready? One, two… After you.

628
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:54,329
Wait, what?

629
00:40:57,583 --> 00:40:59,626
Dog? Still alive?

630
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,752
Let's go find out.

631
00:41:00,836 --> 00:41:02,004
Wait!

632
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:11,305
Um…

633
00:41:12,681 --> 00:41:14,641
Whoa.

634
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:15,767
Wow.

635
00:41:15,851 --> 00:41:20,230
For a Dark Forest,
this place is pretty colorful.

636
00:41:20,314 --> 00:41:22,357
I wish I had my quinceañera here.

637
00:41:22,441 --> 00:41:25,611
The Wishing Star is in here, somewhere.

638
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:28,447
Kitty, may I please see the map?

639
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,781
- No.
- Seriously?

640
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:32,201
You won't let me hold it
for even one minute?

641
00:41:32,284 --> 00:41:34,203
Nope. Not even for one second.

642
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:38,582
Come on, Kitty. You've got to trust me.

643
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:42,044
Wait. What... What's...
What's going on with his eyes?

644
00:41:42,127 --> 00:41:44,338
Oh, they're getting bigger.

645
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:46,840
Oh, Kitty!

646
00:41:46,924 --> 00:41:49,009
You gotta trust him.
Look at those eyes.

647
00:41:49,092 --> 00:41:51,512
Really? You call that cute?

648
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:54,681
Oh, look at her!

649
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:57,559
Those eyes are even bigger than yours.

650
00:41:57,643 --> 00:41:58,852
Do whatever she wants, Puss.

651
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:01,980
Wait a second. So poofy!

652
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:04,358
No! With the paws?

653
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:05,859
Come on!

654
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:07,778
With the hat?

655
00:42:07,861 --> 00:42:10,614
It's all so cute!

656
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:13,575
Cuteness overload!

657
00:42:15,202 --> 00:42:16,828
Can we look at the map now?

658
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,794
"Follow this enchanted chart.

659
00:42:23,877 --> 00:42:27,422
It knows your path and knows your heart."

660
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:30,050
Is that us?

661
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:48,735
{\an8}It says we must go
through the Valley of Incineration,

662
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:50,487
{\an8}over Undertaker Ridge,

663
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:52,406
{\an8}through the Cave of Lost Souls?

664
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:54,658
- Really?
- Let me take a look.

665
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:12,176
{\an8}What? Swamp of Infinite Sorrows?

666
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:14,094
{\an8}Mountains of Misery?

667
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:16,430
{\an8}The Abyss of Eternal Loneliness?

668
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:18,682
There's something wrong with this map.

669
00:43:18,765 --> 00:43:21,393
I guess there is a different
terrible path for everyone.

670
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:24,688
It's almost like the forest
doesn't want anyone to make a wish.

671
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,691
Well, I don't even have a wish.
But can I try?

672
00:43:34,615 --> 00:43:36,241
{\an8}Ooh! Mine says…

673
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:38,035
{\an8}…we skip through
the Pocket Full O' Posies.

674
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:39,244
What?

675
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:41,496
{\an8}Then drift down
the River of Relaxation.

676
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,748
- That sounds fun.
- No fair.

677
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:44,249
Why does he get the good ones?

678
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:46,460
{\an8}Wander the Fields
of Quick and Easy Solutions

679
00:43:46,543 --> 00:43:48,003
{\an8}and arrive at the star!

680
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:49,505
Oh, wow!

681
00:43:49,588 --> 00:43:50,797
That sounds wonderful.

682
00:43:50,881 --> 00:43:53,759
Oh, but no. This is your quest.
I don't wanna impose.

683
00:43:53,842 --> 00:43:55,260
You hold the map.

684
00:43:55,344 --> 00:43:56,970
- Really?
- But don't you cross me.

685
00:43:57,054 --> 00:44:01,308
- Or your name will be <i>Perro Muerto</i>.
- Okeydokey.

686
00:44:04,269 --> 00:44:06,146
Wait. Is that…

687
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:10,359
It's raining bears. Time to go.

688
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:13,987
I'm telling ya, when we get that wish,

689
00:44:14,071 --> 00:44:16,698
it will make everything just right
for all of us.

690
00:44:16,782 --> 00:44:18,158
Will it make us rich?

691
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:20,452
Rich enough to hibernate
all year round?

692
00:44:20,536 --> 00:44:21,578
The richest.

693
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:23,747
Will we be, like, big-time thieves?

694
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,958
The biggest.

695
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:28,126
Here, you know that suit
Jack Horner wears?

696
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:29,753
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna have one of them.

697
00:44:29,837 --> 00:44:31,964
- Yeah?
- Only mine will be purpler.

698
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:33,549
Like, twice as purpler.

699
00:44:33,632 --> 00:44:35,092
The purplest!

700
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:38,512
- Nice. Big-time thieves coming through!
- I'll race you!

701
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:40,556
You can't beat me, old man.

702
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:42,391
What kind of wish can do all that, Goldi?

703
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:44,226
Oh! I can't tell ya.

704
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:46,937
If you say what your wish is,
then it don't come true.

705
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,605
Sorry, birthday wish rules.

706
00:44:48,689 --> 00:44:51,358
Oh, come on. Mother-daughter secret?

707
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:52,985
Mama, just drop it, please.

708
00:44:53,068 --> 00:44:54,361
Oh. Okay.

709
00:44:54,444 --> 00:44:57,739
Hey, come on.
We've got some cats to catch.

710
00:45:01,952 --> 00:45:04,371
Birthday wish rules?
What's that mean?

711
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:06,623
It means I'm not telling you my wish.

712
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:09,376
He doesn't wanna tell us
because it's something stupid.

713
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:11,545
Like conditioner
for that thing on his face.

714
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:12,921
It's distinguished.

715
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:15,591
What about you, Kitty?
What are you gonna wish for?

716
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:19,595
Can't tell you.
Birthday wish rules or whatever.

717
00:45:19,678 --> 00:45:22,181
Ha! I bet your wish
is something stupid like…

718
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:26,393
You're such a…

719
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:34,359
This must be
the Pocket Full O' Posies.

720
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:40,073
Out of the way, demon flower.

721
00:45:40,157 --> 00:45:41,992
It's pruning time!

722
00:45:48,123 --> 00:45:51,418
Aww, thank you.

723
00:45:54,379 --> 00:45:55,756
We don't have time for this.

724
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,467
<i>Perro</i>, I thought your path
was supposed to be easy.

725
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:03,722
You know, I think all you have
to do is stop and smell the roses.

726
00:46:03,805 --> 00:46:05,641
Seriously? Ugh.

727
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:07,559
This is stupid.

728
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:09,102
All I smell is bull…

729
00:46:09,186 --> 00:46:11,897
Shh. Watch.

730
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,649
Ah!

731
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,568
Don't rush through it.

732
00:46:16,652 --> 00:46:21,073
Take your time and really appreciate
what's right in front of you.

733
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:27,412
- Ugh! His path is so corny.
<i>- Gracias.</i>

734
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:29,331
- And cheesy.
- And lame.

735
00:46:29,414 --> 00:46:31,458
- And weird, like him.
- Yeah.

736
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:33,544
Why are you so ridiculous, Dog?

737
00:46:33,627 --> 00:46:34,920
What's your story?

738
00:46:35,003 --> 00:46:36,338
My story? Oh!

739
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:39,508
It's actually a very funny story.

740
00:46:39,591 --> 00:46:42,511
Back when I was a pup,
me and my littermates lived with a family.

741
00:46:42,594 --> 00:46:45,597
A family full of pranksters
who liked to play hide-and-seek,

742
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:47,224
and I was always "it."

743
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:49,560
Pick on the little guy, am I right?

744
00:46:49,643 --> 00:46:52,896
They tried putting me
in a packing crate, a dumpster.

745
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:57,025
No matter how hard they tried,
I'd always find them.

746
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:58,527
So, one day they get creative.

747
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:02,739
And they put me in a sock
with a rock in it.

748
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:06,201
And then throw me in a river.

749
00:47:06,285 --> 00:47:11,498
I gnawed a hole in the sock
and I swam to the surface.

750
00:47:11,582 --> 00:47:13,834
Never found them, or my littermates.

751
00:47:13,917 --> 00:47:17,087
- So, I guess I'm still it.
- Wow.

752
00:47:17,171 --> 00:47:20,465
That is the saddest funny story
I've ever heard.

753
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:22,426
Well, joke's on them.

754
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:25,387
That sock they put me in, I grew into it.

755
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:30,058
So, I got a great story
and a free sweater out of it. Win-win!

756
00:47:30,142 --> 00:47:31,768
Dude, you didn't win.

757
00:47:31,852 --> 00:47:33,812
You, of all people, should have a wish.

758
00:47:33,896 --> 00:47:36,148
I already have a comfy sweater
and two best friends.

759
00:47:36,231 --> 00:47:37,858
I got everything I could wish for.

760
00:47:37,941 --> 00:47:39,276
No magic required.

761
00:47:40,444 --> 00:47:41,695
Hmm?

762
00:47:51,997 --> 00:47:53,373
Oh! Lovely.

763
00:47:58,754 --> 00:48:01,215
Oh! We're getting really close.

764
00:48:01,298 --> 00:48:04,718
I can smell two cats, a dog… and pie?

765
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:09,515
Well, if it isn't the idiots
who tried to steal from me.

766
00:48:09,598 --> 00:48:10,974
Hey, he remembers us.

767
00:48:11,058 --> 00:48:12,100
Behold,

768
00:48:12,184 --> 00:48:14,186
Excalibur!

769
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:15,812
Excalibur!

770
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:18,273
Excalibur!

771
00:48:18,357 --> 00:48:21,610
Yeah, I couldn't get this rock off of it,
but still pretty cool, right?

772
00:48:21,693 --> 00:48:22,945
He's gaining on us!

773
00:48:23,028 --> 00:48:24,530
Okay, little left.

774
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:26,782
- That's it!
- Go faster.

775
00:48:26,865 --> 00:48:28,367
What, he's up me back door…

776
00:48:31,203 --> 00:48:32,538
Goldi!

777
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:46,218
Well… start chopping!

778
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:49,054
On it!
You don't have to tell me twice.

779
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:52,015
I'm gonna chop the heck
out of this <i>Ficus lyrata</i>…

780
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:54,560
Jerry, no!

781
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:57,396
Avenge me, Jack!

782
00:48:57,479 --> 00:48:58,564
Die, die, die!

783
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:01,608
Nope.

784
00:49:01,692 --> 00:49:04,194
Time to bring out the big guns!

785
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:06,029
Guess I overpacked.

786
00:49:06,613 --> 00:49:09,366
Magic snacks. Save those for later.

787
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:10,909
Ah! Pay dirt!

788
00:49:12,578 --> 00:49:15,706
All right, magical locust, defoliate!

789
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:18,959
Fly and feast! Eat those flowers!

790
00:49:19,793 --> 00:49:23,630
I'm not a magic locust.
Why, I'm not a locust at all.

791
00:49:23,714 --> 00:49:26,383
What are you then?
Some sort of demon grasshopper?

792
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:29,553
A deadly fairy?
Put a spell on the forest then.

793
00:49:29,636 --> 00:49:31,263
I don't cast spells.

794
00:49:31,346 --> 00:49:32,431
Well, what do you do?

795
00:49:32,514 --> 00:49:34,141
Well, I-I-I judge you.

796
00:49:34,224 --> 00:49:36,018
I sit on your shoulder

797
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:39,438
and judge your actions
and the quality of your character.

798
00:49:39,521 --> 00:49:41,064
I'm your conscience.

799
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:42,691
I really did overpack.

800
00:49:44,151 --> 00:49:46,236
Help me, Jack! Help!

801
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,071
Aren't you gonna help him, Jack?

802
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:49,448
You're losing a lot of men.

803
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:52,242
I'm not really stressing
about the manpower.

804
00:49:52,326 --> 00:49:55,454
I've got a bottomless bag
of magic weapons.

805
00:49:55,537 --> 00:49:57,164
These babies are gonna get me that wish

806
00:49:57,247 --> 00:50:00,292
even after the whole team
is dead and gone.

807
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:02,169
Now, now, Jack, as your conscience, I…

808
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:05,797
Oh, my word! It's the noble phoenix.

809
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:09,051
She's the symbol of rebirth
and the eternal…

810
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,136
Oh, God!

811
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,139
Pretty boss flamethrower, right?

812
00:50:14,223 --> 00:50:17,601
I really have my work cut out for me
on this one.

813
00:50:17,684 --> 00:50:21,522
Don't be near where I'm flame-throwing.

814
00:50:28,237 --> 00:50:30,155
Do your job, demon flowers.

815
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:32,449
Soon…

816
00:50:36,954 --> 00:50:38,622
Okay, Kitty. I think I've got it now.

817
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:42,125
Trust me.

818
00:50:42,209 --> 00:50:44,962
Easy, easy. You're gonna
give yourself a hernia.

819
00:50:45,045 --> 00:50:46,922
Here, one more time, like this.

820
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:48,757
Trust me.

821
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,637
Ah! But of course I trust you and Puss,
even without the eyes.

822
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,931
Yeah? Big mistake.

823
00:50:56,014 --> 00:50:57,558
What do you mean? You're my friends.

824
00:50:58,141 --> 00:50:59,518
You know what trust gets you?

825
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:02,145
A sock, a rock and a swim in the river.

826
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:04,314
You have to trust somebody, right?

827
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:05,899
Not me. Uh-uh.

828
00:51:05,983 --> 00:51:08,861
Whenever I've let my guard down,
I've been double-crossed,

829
00:51:08,944 --> 00:51:10,946
declawed, played and betrayed.

830
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:15,492
Never again. I am a solo act.

831
00:51:16,076 --> 00:51:19,496
I keep my secrets
and I play my cards close.

832
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,415
That's how you get a winning hand.

833
00:51:21,498 --> 00:51:24,334
Take it from me. Never trust anyone.

834
00:51:28,964 --> 00:51:31,550
Wh... Wait. That's amazing!

835
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:34,011
You're good.

836
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:37,014
Kitty, I've been thinking.

837
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:38,557
Ugh. Thinking about what?

838
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:42,227
My beautiful beard.
It is very distinguished, yes.

839
00:51:42,311 --> 00:51:46,481
But it does deprive the world
a good look at…

840
00:51:46,565 --> 00:51:47,691
the face.

841
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,613
So, if it will make you happy,
I could be convinced to…

842
00:51:52,696 --> 00:51:54,156
- I've gotten used to it.
- Wait, what?

843
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,116
The beard. Keep it.

844
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,494
Uh… Well, you see…

845
00:51:59,578 --> 00:52:01,914
Kitty, please!
Get this itchy thing off of me!

846
00:52:01,997 --> 00:52:04,166
It's like a fever on my face.

847
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:08,462
Hold on. Is the great Puss in Boots
asking for help?

848
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:11,840
<i>Sí</i>, help. You were right.
The beard is disgusting.

849
00:52:11,924 --> 00:52:12,925
And?

850
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:16,011
And it's like a possum crawled on my face.

851
00:52:16,094 --> 00:52:17,137
And?

852
00:52:17,221 --> 00:52:19,765
And died of shame.

853
00:52:19,848 --> 00:52:21,308
Okay, okay, possum face.

854
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:24,937
I won't make you beg.

855
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,357
Ow!

856
00:52:29,066 --> 00:52:30,609
Hey! Slow down. Ow!

857
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:33,445
Go with the grain.
You gotta go with the grain.

858
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:34,780
- I know what I'm doing.
- Hey!

859
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:37,491
I'm a master of the blade. Right, <i>Perrito</i>?

860
00:52:39,368 --> 00:52:40,827
What? What? What's funny?

861
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:43,413
Nothing should be funny.

862
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:53,924
Ah. There's that handsome face
I remember.

863
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:56,426
The face I haven't seen since…

864
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:58,637
- Hey!
- …Santa Coloma.

865
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,138
Ah, yes.

866
00:53:00,222 --> 00:53:02,641
Santa Coloma.

867
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:03,725
You had it coming.

868
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,272
Here. You can have my <i>gatito</i> blade.

869
00:53:09,815 --> 00:53:10,899
Thank you.

870
00:53:10,983 --> 00:53:12,192
Better than a stick.

871
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:16,989
<i>Vaya con dios</i>, stick sword.

872
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:22,870
<i>Perro</i>! What are you doing?

873
00:53:23,453 --> 00:53:25,247
<i>Perro</i>!

874
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:26,623
Where did that crazy dog go?

875
00:53:26,707 --> 00:53:28,208
I think you like him.

876
00:53:28,292 --> 00:53:29,418
No. No, I don't.

877
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:31,503
I think you're ready to name him.

878
00:53:31,587 --> 00:53:34,464
No! I just need his easy path
to get my wish.

879
00:53:34,548 --> 00:53:35,757
You mean my wish.

880
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:37,718
You mean my wish.

881
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:40,554
Sorry.

882
00:53:47,728 --> 00:53:49,146
The Baker's Dozen.

883
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:50,230
Let him go.

884
00:53:50,314 --> 00:53:52,649
Oh, I don't know. I might keep him.

885
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:54,693
Would you like a treat?

886
00:53:54,776 --> 00:53:56,695
Nice granny bag, Little Jack.

887
00:53:56,778 --> 00:54:00,949
It's not a granny bag!
It is a magic nanny bag.

888
00:54:01,033 --> 00:54:02,743
Now, make with the map,

889
00:54:02,826 --> 00:54:06,663
or we'll see
what the unicorn horn really does.

890
00:54:08,457 --> 00:54:11,460
You're not gonna
shoot a puppy, are you, Jack?

891
00:54:11,543 --> 00:54:12,878
Yeah. In the face. Why?

892
00:54:12,961 --> 00:54:14,963
What the…

893
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:17,382
Give us the map,
or else the baker man gets it.

894
00:54:17,466 --> 00:54:18,467
Yeah.

895
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:20,928
I don't even have the map,
Little Bo-Creep.

896
00:54:22,638 --> 00:54:24,223
Stop throwing my men at me!

897
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:26,558
Come here!

898
00:54:26,642 --> 00:54:27,809
Puss in Boots has the map!

899
00:54:27,893 --> 00:54:29,603
Let's get him!

900
00:54:33,398 --> 00:54:34,733
I've got a plan.

901
00:54:34,816 --> 00:54:37,444
First one to the dog gets the wish.

902
00:54:37,528 --> 00:54:40,697
What? Oh, come on!

903
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:53,001
Steady.

904
00:54:54,169 --> 00:54:55,963
Whoa!

905
00:54:58,173 --> 00:54:59,341
What?

906
00:55:01,134 --> 00:55:03,011
So that's what they do. Cool.

907
00:55:03,095 --> 00:55:04,263
No! Not cool!

908
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:07,683
Aw, you shot me!

909
00:55:07,766 --> 00:55:09,184
Ah, the sight's off.

910
00:55:10,561 --> 00:55:11,895
I got him, Mr. Horner!

911
00:55:11,979 --> 00:55:12,980
My bad!

912
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:14,189
Oh, no.

913
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,470
Puss, wait!

914
00:55:46,263 --> 00:55:47,472
<i>Perro</i>!

915
00:55:47,556 --> 00:55:48,849
Thanks for the map, Softpaws.

916
00:55:58,108 --> 00:55:59,568
No, no, no!

917
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:00,569
No!

918
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:04,531
Oi! You've just been crimed
by The Three Bears Crime Family.

919
00:56:04,615 --> 00:56:06,909
- Yeah!
- So long, you plonkers!

920
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:12,122
Puss, where are you?

921
00:56:22,424 --> 00:56:24,384
Puss? Puss?

922
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:28,263
Puss!

923
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:34,895
Puss! What's wrong?

924
00:57:08,637 --> 00:57:10,389
Thank you, <i>Perrito</i>.

925
00:57:11,056 --> 00:57:12,432
What's going on with you, Puss?

926
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,936
I…

927
00:57:16,019 --> 00:57:18,897
I am down to my last life.

928
00:57:19,648 --> 00:57:20,941
And I…

929
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:23,735
I am afraid.

930
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:27,114
Well, it's okay to be afraid.

931
00:57:27,197 --> 00:57:29,324
No, not for Puss in Boots.

932
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:31,952
I'm supposed to be a fearless hero.

933
00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:33,203
A legend.

934
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:36,331
But without lives to spare,

935
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:38,458
I am nothing.

936
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:41,753
I need that wish to get my lives back.

937
00:57:41,837 --> 00:57:43,672
You should tell Kitty.
She would understand.

938
00:57:43,755 --> 00:57:45,966
No, no, no, she cannot hear of this.

939
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:47,384
Okay.

940
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,139
Kitty will never trust me again.

941
00:57:52,723 --> 00:57:54,308
Not after Santa Coloma.

942
00:57:54,391 --> 00:57:56,560
But that's just one bad heist.

943
00:57:56,643 --> 00:57:59,688
Santa Coloma wasn't a heist, <i>Perrito</i>.

944
00:57:59,771 --> 00:58:01,565
It was a church

945
00:58:01,648 --> 00:58:04,443
with a priest and guests.

946
00:58:04,985 --> 00:58:06,820
And Kitty.

947
00:58:06,904 --> 00:58:09,448
<i>Everything but me.</i>

948
00:58:10,407 --> 00:58:12,117
I ran away then too.

949
00:58:12,201 --> 00:58:13,410
Oh…

950
00:58:13,493 --> 00:58:14,703
Oh.

951
00:58:14,786 --> 00:58:16,747
Oh!

952
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:19,249
You left her at the altar?

953
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:20,459
It was wrong. I know.

954
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:22,503
I am ashamed.

955
00:58:23,045 --> 00:58:25,714
I just wish I hadn't hurt her so badly.

956
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:28,675
I regret that day.

957
00:58:29,718 --> 00:58:32,221
So, maybe you should tell that to Kitty.

958
00:58:33,013 --> 00:58:34,556
Might make you feel better.

959
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:37,226
Might make her feel better too.

960
00:58:39,937 --> 00:58:40,938
Puss!

961
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:42,147
Dog!

962
00:58:42,231 --> 00:58:44,816
Oh, there you are.
What happened back there?

963
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,236
Kitty. I lost the map.

964
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:48,570
I messed up.

965
00:58:48,654 --> 00:58:49,905
We'll get it back.

966
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:51,073
We've been in worse pickles.

967
00:58:51,156 --> 00:58:52,616
Who told you that name?

968
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:53,784
What name?

969
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:56,036
Uh… Nothing.

970
00:58:56,119 --> 00:59:00,415
The Bears! We have to find them
before they find the star.

971
00:59:02,292 --> 00:59:04,378
Oh, we are so close.

972
00:59:04,962 --> 00:59:06,839
It's finally happening.

973
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:08,841
I can taste that wish now.

974
00:59:08,924 --> 00:59:11,385
- And you know what it tastes like?
- Pies?

975
00:59:11,468 --> 00:59:12,803
♪ <i>Pies!</i> ♪

976
00:59:12,886 --> 00:59:14,179
♪ <i>Who ate all the pies?</i> ♪

977
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:15,848
♪ <i>Who ate all the pies?</i> ♪

978
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:19,101
♪ <i>Who ate all the pies?</i> ♪

979
00:59:19,184 --> 00:59:20,894
Oh, it's gonna be wicked.

980
00:59:20,978 --> 00:59:23,063
Yeah! Imagine us.

981
00:59:23,146 --> 00:59:25,524
A big-time crime syndicate.

982
00:59:25,607 --> 00:59:28,151
Not a big-time crime syndicate, love.

983
00:59:28,235 --> 00:59:30,612
A big-time crime family.

984
00:59:30,696 --> 00:59:32,406
Isn't that right, Goldi?

985
00:59:32,489 --> 00:59:33,490
- Goldi?
- What?

986
00:59:34,825 --> 00:59:37,411
Whoa! Hey, look, the map!
It's going all fizzly.

987
00:59:37,494 --> 00:59:38,662
What did you do? Give it me.

988
00:59:38,745 --> 00:59:39,955
- Hey!
- No, no, no.

989
00:59:41,456 --> 00:59:42,666
Goldi, no biting!

990
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:46,253
You're the smash, I'm the grab.

991
00:59:46,336 --> 00:59:47,921
I hold the map. You got it?

992
00:59:48,005 --> 00:59:49,548
Okay!

993
00:59:51,133 --> 00:59:54,136
"To find your wish, adjust your view.

994
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:57,014
What you seek
may be right in front of you."

995
00:59:57,097 --> 01:00:00,726
Well, that's a load of rubbish.
What's that supposed to mean?

996
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:02,936
Right in front of us!

997
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,855
It looks like our cabin back home.

998
01:00:04,938 --> 01:00:07,649
You really think our cabin
is in the middle of the Dark Forest?

999
01:00:07,733 --> 01:00:10,402
Baby, give it the old sniff test.

1000
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:12,404
Something's cooking.

1001
01:00:12,487 --> 01:00:14,448
No.

1002
01:00:14,531 --> 01:00:16,658
Do not open that door.

1003
01:00:16,742 --> 01:00:18,785
We are home! Hello, door.

1004
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:20,204
No, don't go inside… Ugh!

1005
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:21,872
Maybe just a quick pop in.

1006
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:24,124
- Hello, chairs.
- What say we hibernate?

1007
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:25,709
Hello, honey.

1008
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:27,878
Hello, my old friend.

1009
01:00:27,961 --> 01:00:32,466
I have missed you so…

1010
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:34,885
Look, Goldi. Porridge.

1011
01:00:34,968 --> 01:00:37,137
And it's made just the way you like it.

1012
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:39,223
No matter how you make it,
she doesn't like it.

1013
01:00:39,306 --> 01:00:40,516
Stop it! All of you.

1014
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:42,768
Maybe our wishes have been granted.

1015
01:00:42,851 --> 01:00:45,103
Just stop! It's not our wish granted.

1016
01:00:45,187 --> 01:00:46,939
It's an obstacle.

1017
01:00:47,022 --> 01:00:49,191
It's the forest playing tricks.

1018
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:51,693
This isn't real. None of this is…

1019
01:01:01,537 --> 01:01:02,538
Ah!

1020
01:01:02,621 --> 01:01:04,498
That was your favorite book.

1021
01:01:04,581 --> 01:01:07,167
You used to stare at it for hours.

1022
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:25,644
Too hard.

1023
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:27,187
Whoop!

1024
01:01:28,313 --> 01:01:29,731
Too soft.

1025
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:37,573
Just right.

1026
01:01:38,073 --> 01:01:40,033
Oh, this was it.

1027
01:01:40,117 --> 01:01:41,326
What was it, Mama?

1028
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:42,953
The day a little orphan girl

1029
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:45,998
broke into our cabin and stole our hearts.

1030
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:53,922
The day when our world became just right.

1031
01:01:58,093 --> 01:01:59,428
How's it going?

1032
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:01,263
Can you see anything up there?

1033
01:02:01,346 --> 01:02:03,432
Not yet, <i>Perrito</i>…

1034
01:02:03,515 --> 01:02:04,766
You okay?

1035
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:06,560
<i>Sí</i>, I am good.

1036
01:02:06,643 --> 01:02:07,895
So good.

1037
01:02:12,316 --> 01:02:14,359
If you wanted to hold my hand,

1038
01:02:14,443 --> 01:02:16,195
all you had to do is ask.

1039
01:02:16,278 --> 01:02:21,033
Uh… Just feel free to pull me up
whenever you get a chance.

1040
01:02:21,116 --> 01:02:26,079
Oh, I was just remembering
the last time I offered you my hand.

1041
01:02:26,163 --> 01:02:28,749
Only, that time,
I believe you had cold feet.

1042
01:02:36,173 --> 01:02:37,299
Kitty…

1043
01:02:40,677 --> 01:02:42,137
About that day,

1044
01:02:42,804 --> 01:02:45,849
Puss in Boots
is not supposed to be afraid.

1045
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:50,020
But outside that church
in Santa Coloma…

1046
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:54,900
…that was the first time I ever felt fear.

1047
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:58,153
So, I ran.

1048
01:02:59,571 --> 01:03:02,407
It was a mistake, Kitty.

1049
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:03,909
It's okay.

1050
01:03:03,992 --> 01:03:06,203
- No, no. It was cowardly.
- It's okay.

1051
01:03:06,286 --> 01:03:08,288
- You alone at the altar.
- Puss.

1052
01:03:08,372 --> 01:03:10,415
In your beautiful poofy wedding dress.

1053
01:03:10,499 --> 01:03:12,626
Puss! It's okay.

1054
01:03:13,585 --> 01:03:14,962
I didn't show up either.

1055
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:17,005
Wait, what?

1056
01:03:17,589 --> 01:03:19,299
What do you mean, you didn't show up?

1057
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:23,470
Well, I knew I could never compete
with your one true love.

1058
01:03:23,554 --> 01:03:25,389
- Who?
- Yourself.

1059
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:26,557
The legend.

1060
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:27,641
Uh.

1061
01:03:27,724 --> 01:03:29,977
I wasn't gonna show up
for that guy.

1062
01:03:30,936 --> 01:03:34,481
But you don't seem like that guy anymore.

1063
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:40,070
Everything okay up there?

1064
01:03:40,153 --> 01:03:42,614
I'm giving you a thumbs up,
just so you know.

1065
01:03:42,698 --> 01:03:43,699
Puss.

1066
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:47,035
Look.

1067
01:03:49,955 --> 01:03:51,123
What do you think, bug?

1068
01:03:51,206 --> 01:03:54,042
Do I wait for the cats to steal the map
and then kill them,

1069
01:03:54,126 --> 01:03:56,879
or do I just kill everybody all at once?

1070
01:03:56,962 --> 01:04:01,341
You know, I'm starting to think
you don't appreciate the value of a life.

1071
01:04:01,425 --> 01:04:04,219
What? No. I mean, I love these guys.

1072
01:04:04,303 --> 01:04:07,723
Flex the glutes. I need a solid surface.

1073
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:11,518
There's good in all people.
There's good in all people.

1074
01:04:11,602 --> 01:04:14,396
You know, Jack,
maybe we need to dig a little deeper.

1075
01:04:14,479 --> 01:04:16,648
Tell me about your childhood.

1076
01:04:16,732 --> 01:04:18,442
Uh…

1077
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:20,819
You know, I never had much as a kid.

1078
01:04:20,903 --> 01:04:22,321
Just loving parents

1079
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:24,740
and stability and a mansion

1080
01:04:24,823 --> 01:04:28,410
and a thriving baked goods enterprise
for me to inherit.

1081
01:04:28,493 --> 01:04:30,204
Useless crap like that.

1082
01:04:31,413 --> 01:04:34,208
But once I get my wish,

1083
01:04:34,291 --> 01:04:38,128
I'll finally have the one thing
that will make me happy.

1084
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:40,380
Oh, well, what's that?

1085
01:04:40,464 --> 01:04:44,051
All of the magic in the world. For me.

1086
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:46,386
And no one else gets any.

1087
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:47,971
Is that so much?

1088
01:04:48,055 --> 01:04:49,056
Yes!

1089
01:04:49,139 --> 01:04:51,683
Agree to disagree.
All right. Bring it over.

1090
01:04:51,767 --> 01:04:53,477
No, no! No, no, no!

1091
01:04:58,857 --> 01:05:00,234
Help!

1092
01:05:00,317 --> 01:05:03,111
Sweet Mother of Goose, Jack!

1093
01:05:03,195 --> 01:05:04,988
Well, you know what they say.

1094
01:05:05,072 --> 01:05:07,908
Can't bake a pie
without losing a dozen men.

1095
01:05:08,659 --> 01:05:10,702
Oh. Oh!

1096
01:05:10,786 --> 01:05:12,204
That was horrible.

1097
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:13,872
Your wish is horrible.

1098
01:05:13,956 --> 01:05:15,082
You're horrible!

1099
01:05:15,165 --> 01:05:17,626
You're an irredeemable monster…

1100
01:05:17,709 --> 01:05:20,629
Oh! Oh!
What took you so long, idiot?

1101
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:23,006
Ugh.

1102
01:05:23,090 --> 01:05:24,591
You're not chatty, are you?

1103
01:05:24,675 --> 01:05:25,926
Mm-mmm.

1104
01:05:28,595 --> 01:05:31,098
Okay, you take the window,
I'll take the chimney.

1105
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:33,433
- What do I take?
- You take it easy, <i>Perrito</i>.

1106
01:05:33,517 --> 01:05:35,394
We need you to stay here and…

1107
01:05:35,477 --> 01:05:37,187
- Guard our rear.
- Yeah, yeah.

1108
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:39,773
On your six.
Got your rears eyeballed and covered.

1109
01:05:39,857 --> 01:05:40,858
Hands in, crew.

1110
01:05:40,941 --> 01:05:42,150
Ready?

1111
01:05:42,234 --> 01:05:44,111
Go, Team Friendship!

1112
01:05:44,194 --> 01:05:46,738
Team Friendship?
I did not agree to this.

1113
01:05:46,822 --> 01:05:48,532
Yeah, do better. Try harder.

1114
01:05:48,615 --> 01:05:50,325
No, just a placeholder name, you know.

1115
01:05:50,409 --> 01:05:52,286
I'll workshop it, okay? Go get 'em, tiger!

1116
01:05:52,369 --> 01:05:54,663
Hey! Take it easy.

1117
01:05:56,957 --> 01:05:59,668
- Ready to get our wish back?
- "Our wish"?

1118
01:05:59,751 --> 01:06:02,921
Well, I've been thinking,
if you play your cards right,

1119
01:06:03,005 --> 01:06:05,591
maybe we could share the wish.

1120
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:08,510
Share the wish?

1121
01:06:27,404 --> 01:06:29,281
It's gone!

1122
01:06:30,032 --> 01:06:31,742
Wake up. Someone's nicked the map.

1123
01:06:31,825 --> 01:06:33,702
What's all this?
What's all this bother about?

1124
01:06:33,785 --> 01:06:35,204
Oi! Did you not hear her?

1125
01:06:35,287 --> 01:06:36,705
The map is missing.

1126
01:06:36,788 --> 01:06:38,707
Somebody took it.

1127
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:40,834
Hola.

1128
01:06:40,918 --> 01:06:43,754
Oi! You crimin' us?
When we just crimed you?

1129
01:06:43,837 --> 01:06:45,339
No. No crime-backs.

1130
01:06:45,422 --> 01:06:47,674
Oh, you're dead cat meat.

1131
01:06:47,758 --> 01:06:49,885
Okay, okay. It's all… yours!

1132
01:06:51,136 --> 01:06:53,388
Nowhere to go, Softpaws.

1133
01:06:53,472 --> 01:06:56,016
Really? Let's see what the map has to say.

1134
01:06:58,268 --> 01:06:59,269
No!

1135
01:06:59,853 --> 01:07:00,979
Our cabin!

1136
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:03,524
My honey! What the Dickens?

1137
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:07,152
Oh, no, you don't.

1138
01:07:11,615 --> 01:07:13,283
Oh, no.

1139
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:20,582
Oof!

1140
01:07:20,666 --> 01:07:22,543
- We're coming, Go…
- I'll get it. I'll get it.

1141
01:07:22,626 --> 01:07:24,086
- Get off me, ya big lump.
- Hold still!

1142
01:07:24,169 --> 01:07:25,587
I'm coming…

1143
01:07:27,297 --> 01:07:28,882
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1144
01:07:32,761 --> 01:07:34,847
Shall we dance? I'll lead.

1145
01:07:36,557 --> 01:07:37,933
Too hot!

1146
01:07:40,644 --> 01:07:43,021
Too cold! Brain freeze.

1147
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:51,029
Oh! That is just right.

1148
01:08:04,084 --> 01:08:05,586
Hey? What the…

1149
01:08:20,267 --> 01:08:21,475
No!

1150
01:08:24,563 --> 01:08:25,522
Oi!

1151
01:08:26,314 --> 01:08:27,316
Forget something?

1152
01:08:35,282 --> 01:08:36,450
They got <i>Perrito</i>!

1153
01:08:36,533 --> 01:08:38,452
Don't worry,
we can track them with this.

1154
01:08:40,037 --> 01:08:41,496
{\an8}Wait, stop!

1155
01:08:47,336 --> 01:08:48,795
Puss, watch out!

1156
01:08:50,546 --> 01:08:51,465
Kitty!

1157
01:08:51,548 --> 01:08:52,799
Puss!

1158
01:08:57,054 --> 01:08:58,555
Look.

1159
01:09:00,515 --> 01:09:02,809
There! There they are. Just out there.

1160
01:09:02,893 --> 01:09:04,895
You go get <i>Perrito</i>.
I'll find a way out of here.

1161
01:09:24,665 --> 01:09:25,916
Puss…

1162
01:09:33,631 --> 01:09:35,759
Hey, good-lookin'!

1163
01:09:36,343 --> 01:09:38,428
Why so jumpy, <i>amigo</i>?

1164
01:09:38,511 --> 01:09:40,680
- What's happening?
- Hello, Puss.

1165
01:09:40,764 --> 01:09:41,932
Gazpacho?

1166
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,767
Long time, no see.

1167
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:46,270
Always a pleasure to see me.

1168
01:09:48,647 --> 01:09:51,399
It's a proper party
now that all nine of us are here.

1169
01:09:51,483 --> 01:09:53,234
Yeah!

1170
01:09:53,318 --> 01:09:54,444
You know what?

1171
01:09:55,028 --> 01:09:56,530
I love you guys.

1172
01:09:56,613 --> 01:09:59,366
So, you are my former lives?

1173
01:09:59,449 --> 01:10:01,827
Reflections of the good ol' days.

1174
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:03,662
Okay.

1175
01:10:03,745 --> 01:10:05,205
Back when we were larger than life.

1176
01:10:05,289 --> 01:10:06,290
A legend!

1177
01:10:06,373 --> 01:10:07,374
We danced.

Them cats stole the stolen map we stole,

1185
01:10:29,563 --> 01:10:31,440
and we ended up with diddly-squat.
Nothing.

1186
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:33,233
Or maybe,

1187
01:10:33,317 --> 01:10:35,485
we could be happy without a wish.

1188
01:10:35,569 --> 01:10:36,653
What are we doing?

1189
01:10:36,737 --> 01:10:38,113
They ain't coming back.

1190
01:10:38,197 --> 01:10:39,948
Goodbye, purple trousers.

1191
01:10:40,032 --> 01:10:42,326
Oh, they'll come back. For him.

1192
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:44,536
You're darn tootin'.

1193
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:47,080
Puss and Kitty always rescue me
when I'm kidnapped,

1194
01:10:47,164 --> 01:10:48,540
which happens a lot.

1195
01:10:48,624 --> 01:10:50,542
'Cause we're a team.

1196
01:10:50,626 --> 01:10:52,419
- Oh, that's lovely.
- Yep.

1197
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:53,879
Team Friendship.

1198
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:55,839
Ugh! No! That is a crap name.

1199
01:10:55,923 --> 01:10:58,050
Well, we're... we're still workshopping it.

1200
01:10:58,133 --> 01:11:01,553
Oh, them cats ain't gonna risk their lives
for this daft little pup.

1201
01:11:01,637 --> 01:11:03,931
You're just sayin' that
because you want to eat him.

1202
01:11:04,014 --> 01:11:05,015
I do not.

1203
01:11:05,098 --> 01:11:07,768
I just wanna pet him with my teeth.

1204
01:11:07,851 --> 01:11:10,145
Stop thinking about your belly, Baby.

1205
01:11:10,229 --> 01:11:12,272
In fact, stop thinking, period.

1206
01:11:12,356 --> 01:11:14,149
You'll just hurt yourself, you muppet.

1207
01:11:14,233 --> 01:11:15,567
Muppet.

1208
01:11:15,651 --> 01:11:20,072
And why would I listen
to a porridge-stealing orphan like you?

1209
01:11:20,155 --> 01:11:21,365
You're not even a bear.

1210
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:22,449
Zing!

1211
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:24,409
I'm more of a bear than you are.

1212
01:11:24,493 --> 01:11:26,328
She got you.

1213
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:28,789
You're nothing but a low-rent Cinderella.

1214
01:11:28,872 --> 01:11:31,750
- Oh!
- Well, that's rich, coming from you, Baby.

1215
01:11:31,834 --> 01:11:33,836
- 'Cause you know what you are?
- Wait for it.

1216
01:11:33,919 --> 01:11:35,546
You're a daft, fat,

1217
01:11:35,629 --> 01:11:38,048
slow-thinking,
no-reading, Lyme-diseased,

1218
01:11:38,131 --> 01:11:40,551
- flea-ridden dingleberry bear.
- Boom!

1219
01:11:40,634 --> 01:11:42,344
I haven't got dingleberries.

1220
01:11:42,427 --> 01:11:44,137
No, you do. You do have 'em.

1221
01:11:44,221 --> 01:11:45,472
- Dingleberries!
- Oi!

1222
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:48,809
You shut up, you little mutt,
or I'll cut you from pooper to snooter!

1223
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:51,979
I'm in the mix now! Okay!

1224
01:11:52,062 --> 01:11:53,313
Okay, here we go.

1225
01:11:53,397 --> 01:11:55,649
You're all a bunch of knuckle-dragging,

1226
01:11:55,732 --> 01:11:57,568
honey-scrounging, grub

1230
01:12:05,367 --> 01:12:07,536
I like the cut of his jib.

1231
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:09,705
Ah! This is great.

1232

Razzin' and ribbin' and barbin'

Oh, I wish I had a family like this.

Speaking from one orphan
to another, Goldi,

1235
01:12:19,882 --> 01:12:22,134
you won the orphan lottery.

1236
01:12:23,844 --> 01:12:25,637
I like his jib as well.

1237
01:12:25,721 --> 01:12:27,306
- Let's keep him.
- What?

1238
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:29,725
{\an8}Hmm? Where'd he go?

1239
01:12:29,808 --> 01:12:31,185
No! We said no crime-backs.

1245
01:12:44,698 --> 01:12:46,325
No, no, sorry, fellas.

1246
01:12:46,408 --> 01:12:48,076
This has been fun, eh?

1247
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:50,454
Yeah. But could you tell me
how to get out of here?

1248
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:52,289
I've got to get back to Dog and Kitty.

1249
01:12:53,749 --> 01:12:55,709
Whoa!
I thought you were going to get the wish.

1250
01:12:55,792 --> 01:12:57,628
You got the map. You don't need them.

1251
01:12:57,711 --> 01:12:59,546
Yeah, get those lives back.

1252
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:01,340
Become the legend again.

1253
01:13:01,423 --> 01:13:02,925
Town to town.

1254
01:13:03,008 --> 01:13:04,426
Puss in Boots!

1255
01:13:04,510 --> 01:13:06,220
- Puss in Boots!
- Party to party.

1256
01:13:09,014 --> 01:13:11,141
Puss in Boots walks alone.

1257
01:13:15,354 --> 01:13:16,355
<i>Yeah,</i>

1258
01:13:16,438 --> 01:13:19,107
Puss in Boots walks alone.

1259
01:13:21,443 --> 01:13:25,739
Was the legend so big,
there was no room for anyone else?

1260
01:13:30,160 --> 01:13:31,995
The legend is still big, <i>gato.</i>

1261
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:33,497
It's you that got small.

1262
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,165
Yeah, you changed, man.

1263
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:37,751
I hear he's best friends with a dog now.

1264
01:13:37,835 --> 01:13:40,546
And he doesn't even have a sword.

1265
01:13:40,629 --> 01:13:41,713
Some hero.

1266
01:13:41,797 --> 01:13:43,215
You've become a scaredy-cat.

1267
01:13:43,298 --> 01:13:45,217
We should call him Wuss in Boots.

1268
01:13:45,801 --> 01:13:47,719
No, no. No. Didn't you hear?

1269
01:13:47,803 --> 01:13:49,471
His new name is Pickles.

1270
01:13:49,555 --> 01:13:51,306
So lame.

1271
01:13:51,390 --> 01:13:53,600
Where's your litter box, Pickles?

1272
01:13:53,684 --> 01:13:55,686
You know what? You guys are jerks.

1273
01:13:55,769 --> 01:13:57,813
Which is very conflicting for me.

1274
01:13:57,896 --> 01:13:59,982
I'll find my own way out. <i>Adios</i>!

1275
01:14:00,065 --> 01:14:01,817
Oh! You think
you're better than us?

1276
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:04,987
Without us,
you will always live a life of…

1277
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:06,905
Fear.

1278
01:14:06,989 --> 01:14:08,073
You!

1279
01:14:08,156 --> 01:14:11,326
I do love the smell of fear.

1280
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:14,621
- It's intoxicating.
- It is?

1281
01:14:14,705 --> 01:14:17,875
Sorry to crash the party
with your past lives,

1282
01:14:17,958 --> 01:14:20,836
or your past deaths,
as I like to call 'em.

1283
01:14:22,963 --> 01:14:26,550
I was there to witness all of them.

1284
01:14:26,633 --> 01:14:30,179
Each frivolous end.

1285
01:14:31,305 --> 01:14:34,766
But you didn't even notice me

1286
01:14:34,850 --> 01:14:40,189
because Puss in Boots laughs
in the face of death, right?

1287
01:14:42,065 --> 01:14:44,401
But you're not laughing now.

1288
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:49,198
You are no bounty hunter. You are…

1289
01:14:49,281 --> 01:14:50,657
Death.

1290
01:14:53,827 --> 01:14:56,455
And I don't mean it metaphorically,
or rhetorically,

1291
01:14:56,538 --> 01:14:58,332
or poetically, or theoretically,

1292
01:14:58,415 --> 01:15:01,210
or in any other fancy way.

1293
01:15:01,293 --> 01:15:02,753
I'm Death,

1294
01:15:02,836 --> 01:15:04,588
straight up.

1295
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:07,466
And I've come for you, Puss in Boots.

1296
01:15:07,549 --> 01:15:09,384
But I'm still alive.

1297
01:15:09,468 --> 01:15:11,720
You know…

1298
01:15:11,803 --> 01:15:13,347
…I'm not a cat person.

1299
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:18,268
I find the very idea of nine lives absurd.

1300
01:15:18,352 --> 01:15:21,563
And you didn't value any of them.

1301
01:15:21,647 --> 01:15:24,441
So, why don't I do us both a favor

1302
01:15:24,525 --> 01:15:27,194
and take this last one now?

1303
01:15:27,277 --> 01:15:28,695
That's cheating!

1304
01:15:28,779 --> 01:15:30,697
Shh. Don't tell.

1305
01:15:30,781 --> 01:15:32,866
Run, Puss in Boots! Make the wish!

1306
01:15:34,034 --> 01:15:35,869
Go ahead. Run for it.

1307
01:15:35,953 --> 01:15:38,789
Makes it more fun for me.

1308
01:15:44,336 --> 01:15:46,255
Run.

1309
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:50,092
<i>Run.</i>

1310
01:15:52,553 --> 01:15:53,846
Run.

1311
01:15:55,097 --> 01:15:56,098
<i>Run.</i>

1312
01:15:56,849 --> 01:15:59,268
<i>Run.</i>

1313
01:16:01,311 --> 01:16:02,354
Hey, Puss!

1314
01:16:02,437 --> 01:16:03,856
Run.

1315
01:16:03,939 --> 01:16:05,774
Puss! Puss, we're here.

1316
01:16:08,151 --> 01:16:11,154
Where's he going?

1317
01:16:23,876 --> 01:16:24,877
<i>Run.</i>

1318
01:16:26,795 --> 01:16:27,796
<i>Run.</i>

1319
01:17:16,178 --> 01:17:19,389
That's the third time
we've passed that same rock, Baby.

1320
01:17:19,473 --> 01:17:20,474
Oh, not again!

1321
01:17:20,557 --> 01:17:23,018
What do you want me to do?
I've lost the scent.

1322
01:17:23,101 --> 01:17:25,312
You only have one job.

1323
01:17:25,395 --> 01:17:28,565
The one thing that
makes you mildly useful is your nose,

1324
01:17:28,649 --> 01:17:31,360
- and apparently you can't even use that.
- Goldi.

1325
01:17:31,443 --> 01:17:33,946
I'm starting to think this wish
isn't what you promised us.

1326
01:17:34,029 --> 01:17:35,489
- Leave off, Baby.
- So what is it?

1327
01:17:35,572 --> 01:17:37,616
Eh? What's your "just right"?

1328
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,451
What's so blasted important

1329
01:17:39,535 --> 01:17:41,870
that you've got us stranded
in this haunted forest?

1330
01:17:41,954 --> 01:17:45,374
I'm getting a family! That's what.
A proper family.

1331
01:17:45,999 --> 01:17:48,335
Then everything will be just right.

1332
01:17:51,547 --> 01:17:55,425
Your "just right" is getting rid of us?

1333
01:17:56,468 --> 01:17:59,680
Well, I guess some people just
stick around until the porridge is gone.

1334
01:17:59,763 --> 01:18:00,764
Eh, Goldi?

1335
01:18:04,268 --> 01:18:05,561
Come on.

1336
01:18:05,644 --> 01:18:08,146
You didn't think I would actually stay?

1337
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:10,190
I'm not a bear.

1338
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:22,119
I was always afraid
it was too good to last.

1339
01:18:23,453 --> 01:18:25,205
And whether you think
we're your family or not,

1340
01:18:26,081 --> 01:18:29,042
if this is something
that will make you happy,

1341
01:18:29,126 --> 01:18:30,836
we'll get you that wish.

1342
01:18:31,628 --> 01:18:32,629
Come on, boys.

1343
01:18:40,012 --> 01:18:44,141
Oh-ho-ho! What a good boy am I.

1344
01:18:53,066 --> 01:18:55,319
"Star light, star bright,

1345
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:57,946
first star I see tonight.

1346
01:18:58,030 --> 01:18:59,031
I wish…"

1347
01:18:59,114 --> 01:19:00,908
I can't believe I fell for it again.

1348
01:19:00,991 --> 01:19:03,619
Kitty, you don't understand.

1349
01:19:03,702 --> 01:19:04,745
Don't understand what?

1350
01:19:04,828 --> 01:19:07,039
That you've been playing me
this whole time?

1351
01:19:07,122 --> 01:19:08,749
I need this wish.

1352
01:19:08,832 --> 01:19:11,418
Oh, yeah? You wanna know
what my wish was?

1353
01:19:12,336 --> 01:19:15,047
Someone, anyone I could trust.

1354
01:19:15,130 --> 01:19:16,715
Hey.

1355
01:19:16,798 --> 01:19:19,510
In my whole life, I've never had that.

1356
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:24,223
But I thought I finally found
that someone without a wish.

1357
01:19:25,807 --> 01:19:26,934
I thought it was you.

1358
01:19:28,477 --> 01:19:30,145
But you're still running.

1359
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:32,940
Still the same old Puss in Boots.

1360
01:19:33,023 --> 01:19:35,526
But I'm not! I'm not Puss in Boots.

1361
01:19:35,609 --> 01:19:38,779
I'm... I am on my last life.

1362
01:19:39,738 --> 01:19:41,532
I need to get my lives back.

1363
01:19:41,615 --> 01:19:44,701
Without them, I'm not… I am not…

1364
01:19:44,785 --> 01:19:46,119
What? The legend?

1365
01:19:49,748 --> 01:19:52,334
I still can't compete
with your one true love.

1366
01:19:53,293 --> 01:19:55,379
Go on. Get your lives back…

1367
01:19:57,256 --> 01:19:59,049
Just keep them out of mine.

1368
01:20:04,012 --> 01:20:05,931
Kitty, Death is after me!

1369
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:07,182
What?

1370
01:20:07,266 --> 01:20:09,393
I've been called a lot of things,

1371
01:20:10,018 --> 01:20:11,520
but never "Death."

1372
01:20:11,603 --> 01:20:14,106
I like it. That's my wish!

1373
01:20:14,189 --> 01:20:15,190
Oi!

1374
01:20:15,732 --> 01:20:17,693
That's Goldi's wish.

1375
01:20:53,854 --> 01:20:54,855
Grab it!

1376
01:20:56,356 --> 01:20:57,983
Move! Out of my way!

1377
01:20:58,066 --> 01:20:59,276
I've got it! I've got it!

1378
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:00,360
Don't got it!

1379
01:21:02,196 --> 01:21:03,488
That's mine!

1380
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:11,163
Bang, bang, bang!

1381
01:21:13,373 --> 01:21:15,417
Oh, come on! You walked into that one.

1382
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:19,880
Mr. Horner, I need your help!

1383
01:21:19,963 --> 01:21:23,717
Duly noted, but a little busy
at the moment. Pew, pew!

1384
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,385
Mr. Horner!

1385
01:21:33,852 --> 01:21:34,895
Ooh!

1386
01:21:34,978 --> 01:21:37,773
Ha-ha! It's bear season!

1387
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:41,151
Oi! I'm gonna bust you up, plum-thumb,

1388
01:21:41,235 --> 01:21:43,070
and then I'm gonna wear your clothes!

1389
01:21:43,153 --> 01:21:44,363
That was weird.

1390
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:48,951
No, no, no! No, no, no, no!

1391
01:21:49,034 --> 01:21:50,118
- Baby!
- Mama, help!

1392
01:21:50,202 --> 01:21:51,161
I got you!

1393
01:21:51,245 --> 01:21:52,246
- Papa!
- Son!

1394
01:21:52,329 --> 01:21:53,997
I'm coming! I got you.

1395
01:21:54,081 --> 01:21:54,915
Help!

1396
01:21:55,541 --> 01:21:57,793
- Hold on!
- Something's happening!

1397
01:21:57,876 --> 01:21:59,044
Help me!

1398
01:22:01,004 --> 01:22:02,756
No, no, no!

1399
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,550
Hang on, son!

1400
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:07,094
I can't stop it!

1401
01:22:07,177 --> 01:22:10,681
Mama, I'm slipping! I'm slipping!

1402
01:22:14,977 --> 01:22:16,687
Like I told you, Baby,

1403
01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:18,730
you're the smash, I'm the grab.

1404
01:22:18,814 --> 01:22:20,649
Yes! Yes!

1405
01:22:23,694 --> 01:22:25,279
No!

1406
01:22:30,951 --> 01:22:35,122
Hey, Softpaws.
How do you like these apples?

1407
01:22:35,205 --> 01:22:37,291
Die! Blow up already!

1408
01:22:38,166 --> 01:22:40,294
Soft paws!

1409
01:22:42,838 --> 01:22:44,298
Okay, okay, you know,

1410
01:22:44,381 --> 01:22:47,885
maybe it's time to bury the hatchet!

1411
01:22:49,303 --> 01:22:53,640
Oh, I shouldn't have telegraphed it!

1412
01:23:02,149 --> 01:23:04,151
Yeah. I don't know what to do with this.

1413
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:07,613
But if you think you need those lives…

1414
01:23:07,696 --> 01:23:09,072
Thank you, <i>Perrito</i>.

1415
01:23:10,032 --> 01:23:12,868
You know, I've only ever had one life,

1416
01:23:12,951 --> 01:23:15,495
but sharing it with you and Kitty

1417
01:23:15,579 --> 01:23:17,706
has made it pretty special.

1418
01:23:17,789 --> 01:23:20,959
Maybe one life is enough.

1419
01:23:29,176 --> 01:23:30,052
- Huh?
- What is that?

1420
01:23:37,643 --> 01:23:38,685
Who's that?

1421
01:23:40,646 --> 01:23:42,022
He's here for me.

1422
01:23:48,529 --> 01:23:49,530
Puss!

1423
01:23:53,742 --> 01:23:55,786
I've enjoyed the chase, <i>gato</i>.

1424
01:23:56,495 --> 01:23:58,997
But I think we've reached the end now,
you and I.

1425
01:24:00,999 --> 01:24:03,544
{\an8}You gonna take the coward's way out?

1426
01:24:03,627 --> 01:24:05,838
Run away to more lives?

1427
01:24:07,381 --> 01:24:08,423
Or are you gonna fight?

1428
01:24:14,096 --> 01:24:15,305
Pick it up.

1429
01:24:16,974 --> 01:24:18,517
Go on. Pick it up.

1430
01:24:36,285 --> 01:24:37,536
What's the matter?

1431
01:24:37,619 --> 01:24:40,205
Lives flashing before your eyes?

1432
01:24:40,789 --> 01:24:43,041
No. Just one.

1433
01:24:44,126 --> 01:24:45,210
I'm done running.

1434
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:52,259
Fear me, if you dare.

1435
01:24:53,343 --> 01:24:55,804
This is gonna be fun.

1436
01:25:05,898 --> 01:25:07,191
Yah!

1437
01:25:15,824 --> 01:25:18,827
<i>Bien. Muy bien.</i>

1438
01:25:36,220 --> 01:25:39,681
You really gotta stop losing that.

1439
01:25:53,695 --> 01:25:56,156
Say hello to my <i>gatito</i> blade.

1440
01:26:01,203 --> 01:26:02,204
Come on!

1441
01:26:03,497 --> 01:26:04,790
Huh?

1442
01:26:22,516 --> 01:26:23,642
Pick it up.

1443
01:26:26,311 --> 01:26:28,605
I know I can never defeat you, <i>lobo</i>,

1444
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:31,525
but I will never stop fighting
for this life.

1445
01:26:57,426 --> 01:26:59,303
You're ruining this for me.

1446
01:26:59,386 --> 01:27:02,848
I came here for an arrogant, little legend

1447
01:27:02,931 --> 01:27:05,017
who thought he was immortal.

1448
01:27:07,227 --> 01:27:09,479
But I don't see him anymore.

1449
01:27:13,817 --> 01:27:17,362
Live your life, Puss in Boots.
Live it well.

1450
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:24,119
You know we will meet again, right?

1451
01:27:39,968 --> 01:27:42,679
You know, when you
said Death was after you,

1452
01:27:42,763 --> 01:27:45,349
I thought you were
just being melodramatic.

1453
01:27:46,642 --> 01:27:47,726
The wish is yours.

1454
01:27:48,602 --> 01:27:50,771
You deserve someone you can trust.

1455
01:27:56,068 --> 01:27:58,904
I don't need it.
I've got what I wished for.

1456
01:27:58,987 --> 01:28:00,572
No magic required.

1457
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:14,378
Ah. Magic snacks.

1458
01:28:19,591 --> 01:28:22,219
Holy <i>frijoles</i>.

1459
01:28:22,302 --> 01:28:24,847
I was worried for a second
I would come out naked,

1460
01:28:24,930 --> 01:28:27,474
but my clothes grew too! Cool.

1461
01:28:28,225 --> 01:28:29,726
Thank you.

1462
01:28:31,895 --> 01:28:33,313
Gotcha!

1463
01:28:33,397 --> 01:28:35,232
The last wish.

1464
01:28:35,732 --> 01:28:37,693
It's mine!

1465
01:28:38,527 --> 01:28:39,862
"Star light,

1466
01:28:39,945 --> 01:28:40,988
star bright,

1467
01:28:41,071 --> 01:28:43,824
first star I see tonight.

1468
01:28:43,907 --> 01:28:44,783
<i>Perrito!</i>

1469
01:28:44,867 --> 01:28:48,120
I wish I may, I wish I might

1470
01:28:48,203 --> 01:28:50,122
- have this wish…"
<i>- Señor</i> Horner!

1471
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:53,792
Please don't make that wish. Please.

1472
01:28:55,043 --> 01:28:56,420
Please.

1473
01:28:56,503 --> 01:28:57,546
What are you doing?

1474
01:28:57,629 --> 01:28:59,840
Please.

1475
01:28:59,923 --> 01:29:01,842
Seriously, are you having a hernia
or something?

1476
01:29:01,925 --> 01:29:05,637
Pretty… …please.

1477
01:29:08,056 --> 01:29:10,893
They're such pools of vulnerability.

1478
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:15,147
It's so cute

1479
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:17,316
how you think that would work on me.

1480
01:29:17,399 --> 01:29:19,276
Don't you know I'm dead inside?

1481
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:21,069
By the way, your nose is bleeding.

1482
01:29:21,153 --> 01:29:22,321
Oh.

1483
01:29:22,404 --> 01:29:26,241
I was just buying some time
for Team Friendship.

1484
01:29:27,910 --> 01:29:29,161
Team what?

1485
01:29:38,045 --> 01:29:40,047
{\an8}Spanish Splinter!

1486
01:29:40,130 --> 01:29:41,590
Ow!

1487
01:29:45,594 --> 01:29:47,012
Hey!

1488
01:29:51,558 --> 01:29:53,185
What have you done?

1489
01:29:53,769 --> 01:29:54,811
No!

1490
01:29:54,895 --> 01:29:56,647
The map. My wish.

1491
01:29:56,730 --> 01:29:57,689
Go, go, go!

1492
01:30:02,194 --> 01:30:05,948
It's mine. Huh?

1493
01:30:06,031 --> 01:30:08,408
You looking for something?

1494
01:30:08,492 --> 01:30:10,953
Consider this my resignation, mister.

1495
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:14,915
Wha...

1496
01:30:15,874 --> 01:30:18,585
What did I do to deserve this?

1497
01:30:19,253 --> 01:30:23,799
I mean, what specifically?

1498
01:30:33,183 --> 01:30:34,184
Gorgeous.

1499
01:30:36,186 --> 01:30:40,107
I hate to say it,
but should we make a wish?

1500
01:30:40,190 --> 01:30:43,944
Kitty, one life spent with you

1501
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:46,029
is all that I could wish for.

1502
01:30:56,790 --> 01:30:58,709
You saved my life, sis.

1503
01:30:59,293 --> 01:31:01,336
You was gonna make the wish
but you didn't make the wish

1504
01:31:01,420 --> 01:31:03,005
'cause you wanted to save your family…

1505
01:31:03,088 --> 01:31:04,923
…and I was really scared. And then…

1506
01:31:05,007 --> 01:31:07,634
Oi, don't get so blubbery about it.

1507
01:31:07,718 --> 01:31:09,678
Whose porridge would I eat otherwise?

1508
01:31:09,761 --> 01:31:12,389
I'm sorry you didn't get your wish,
Goldi-love.

1509
01:31:12,472 --> 01:31:14,975
But I did, Mama. I did get my wish.

1510
01:31:15,475 --> 01:31:17,102
Everything

1511
01:31:17,603 --> 01:31:19,229
is just right.

1512
01:31:20,814 --> 01:31:22,983
Oh! Now you've made me cry.

1513
01:31:23,066 --> 01:31:24,526
Oh!

1514
01:31:24,610 --> 01:31:27,321
Now, what say we all go home
and hibernate?

1515
01:31:27,404 --> 01:31:29,990
Goldi, you are a chip off the old block,
you are.

1516
01:31:30,073 --> 01:31:31,575
Well, what can I say?

1517
01:31:32,701 --> 01:31:34,411
I won the orphan lottery.

1518
01:31:35,579 --> 01:31:37,247
Softpaws. Boots.

1519
01:31:37,331 --> 01:31:38,790
- Goldi.
- Bears.

1520
01:31:38,874 --> 01:31:41,877
Hey, Baby,
you got any ideas for our next job?

1521
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:43,754
Oh! Remember that pie factory?

1522
01:31:43,837 --> 01:31:47,591
I suspect that they might be experiencing
a leadership vacuum.

1523
01:31:47,674 --> 01:31:50,677
Oh, family business!
Oh, how exciting!

1524
01:31:50,761 --> 01:31:54,473
Now's a good time
to talk about ethical business practices.

1525
01:31:55,516 --> 01:31:58,519
There's a talking cockroach on my nose.
Get it off! Get it off!

1526
01:31:58,602 --> 01:31:59,895
Hold still.

1527
01:31:59,978 --> 01:32:01,063
Wait just a second.

1528
01:32:01,146 --> 01:32:02,940
Hey! Hang on!

1529
01:32:03,023 --> 01:32:06,401
Hey, <i>Perrito</i>. About that name.
Let's pick one out for you.

1530
01:32:06,485 --> 01:32:09,613
- Yeah. Oh, what about Chiquito?
- Mmm…

1531
01:32:09,696 --> 01:32:12,991
Chomper! What do you think, <i>Perrito</i>?
Chomper, no?

1532
01:32:13,075 --> 01:32:16,453
I got it, I got it. How about Jeff?

1533
01:32:16,537 --> 01:32:17,579
- Jeff?
- Yeah.

1534
01:32:17,663 --> 01:32:19,164
He doesn't have a Jeff's face.

1535
01:32:20,374 --> 01:32:24,253
You know, if it's the same to you,
I think I'll just stick with Perrito.

1536
01:32:24,336 --> 01:32:27,714
I kinda like it,
since that's what my friends call me.

1537
01:32:27,798 --> 01:32:29,883
Then Perrito it shall be.

1538
01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:34,346
You know, to be honest,
Chomper is pretty good.

1539
01:32:34,429 --> 01:32:35,639
Yeah, but no.

1540
01:32:35,722 --> 01:32:38,767
Well, we'll keep workshopping it.

1541
01:32:51,321 --> 01:32:54,408
I want this vacation to be perfect!

1542
01:32:54,491 --> 01:32:56,702
Did you remember to pack my captain's hat?

1543
01:32:56,785 --> 01:32:59,746
Yes, Governor. And your captain's shoes,
your captain's coat

1544
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:01,248
and your captain's pajamas.

1545
01:33:01,331 --> 01:33:04,960
And what about… My boat!

1546
01:33:05,043 --> 01:33:06,837
Puss in Boots!

1547
01:33:13,177 --> 01:33:14,261
<i>Perrito</i>.

1548
01:33:14,344 --> 01:33:17,181
Team Friendship?
We did not agree to this.

1549
01:33:17,264 --> 01:33:19,641
Yeah, it makes us look ridiculous.

1550
01:33:19,725 --> 01:33:21,185
Too late now. It's official.

1551
01:33:21,268 --> 01:33:22,895
Seagull!

1552
01:33:24,688 --> 01:33:27,274
Steady as she goes, Perrito.

1553
01:33:27,858 --> 01:33:28,901
Dokey doke.

1554
01:33:28,984 --> 01:33:30,319
Where are we headed anyways?

1555
01:33:30,903 --> 01:33:36,325
