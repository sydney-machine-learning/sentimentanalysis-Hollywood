Hey! Whoa! Yo!
False alarm! Hold it!

2
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,040
It's OK! I'm here.
Here we are! It's all right.

3
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,280
- Set it down nice and easy, huh?
- Sure, at the impound.

4
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,760
- Next time, read the sign.
- You don't understand.

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,120
l'm here to meet my wife's plane.
Let me have this car.

6
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,040
Sure. Tomorrow, 8.00 to 4.00.
Pay $40, we give it back.

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,320
Don't write it up!

8
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,320
Come on, this is my mother-in-law's car.

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,240
She's already mad at me
cos I'm not a dentist.

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,240
Look, I'm a cop. LAPD.

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,080
Oh, I was in LA once. Hated it.

12
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,240
l can understand.
I don't like it much... Hey!

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,720
That's a plastic fender up there!
Take it easy!

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
Cut me some slack, will you?

15
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,320
l was a cop in New York City.

16
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,920
l only moved to LA
because my wife took ajob there.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,120
What do you say?

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,440
Here we are, Washington, DC,
the heart of democracy.

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,200
One hand washes the other.

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,880
Come on, man. It's Christmas.

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,320
So ask Santa Claus
to give you another car.

22
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,400
Merry Christmas, pal.

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,520
It's all yours, Murray.

24
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,400

Hi. Where are the telephones?

30
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,080
- Over there.
- Thank you very much.

31
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,360
(TV) LeonardAdkins is in a warmer clime...

32
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,560
..with a story that grows
hotter by the minute.

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,360
Security was tight today
at Escalan airportin Valverde,...

34
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,480
..where government authorities report...

35
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,480
..that deposed general Ramon Esperanza...

36
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,320
..will be delivered
for extradition to the United States.

37
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,360
Only two years ago,
General Esperanza...

38
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,520
..led his country's armyin a campaign
against communist insurgents,...

39
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,440
..a campaign fought with
American money and advisers.

40
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,360
Esperanza's fall from power
caused ripples...

41
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,040
..in his country's recent election,
and closer to home as well,...

42
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,520
..when high-ranking
Pentagon officials were charged...

43
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,200
..with supplying him with weapons
despite the Congressional ban.

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,960
Evidence that Esperanza's forces...

45
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,840
..violated the neutrality
of neighbouring countries...

46
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,000
..made Congress withhold funds.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,520
Esperanza is accused
of replacing the funds...

48
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,120
- ..by cocaine smuggling.
- (beeping)

49
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,760
Although Esperanza was removed
as commander in chief this year,...

50
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,120
..the agreement to extradite him
was only reached yesterday.

51
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,960
Washington insiders say
a phone call made it happen,...

52
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,400
..a phone call from a...

54
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,200
All right, all right.

55
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,360
lf I could find a phone,
I'd call you, whoever you are.

56
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,480
Bye.

57
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,360
Excuse me. Thank you.

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,320
This is Lieutenant McClane.
Somebody there beep me?

59
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,440
- I'd like to think I'm somebody.
- Honey!

60
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,120
Where are you? Did you land yet?

61
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,600
It's the nineties, remember?

62
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,960
Microchips, microwaves, faxes, air phones.

63
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,720
As far as I'm concerned,
progress peaked with frozen pizza.

64
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,720
Listen, um, we're going to be
about half an hour late landing, OK?

65
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,320
l just wanted to let you know.
The kids OK?

66
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:42,080
They'll lose their minds
from all the sugar your parents give them.

67
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,800
Did Mom give you a hard time
about borrowing her new car?

68
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,240
No. Not yet.

69
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,160
Listen, honey, when you land,
can we just, like, you know,...

70
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,040
..rent a car, check into a hotel,
leave the kids with your parents?

71
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,520
Order some room service?

72
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,920
A bottle of champagne,
what do you say?

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,920
You're on, Lieutenant.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,480
l'll see you in about
half an hour, honey.

75
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,920

lsn't technology wonderful?

77
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,240
My husband doesn't think so.

78
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,000
Well, I do.

79
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,280
l used to carry around
those awful Mace things.

80
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,880
Now...

81
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,360
l zap any bastard that screws with me.

82
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,800
l tried it on my little dog.

83
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,200
Poor thing limped for a week.

84
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,800
Excuse me.

85
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,600
Well, you look really familiar to me.

86
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,520
l get that a lot. I've been on TV.

87
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,280
Yeah. Me, too.

88
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,080

- You got it.

91
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,800
..has just arrived under aheavy guard.

92
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,560
The deposed dictator's mood
seems jubilant.

93
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,840
- He is waving to the crowd,...
- (knocking)

94
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,080
..as if running for political office.

95
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,960
..thousands of political prisoners,
including the new president.

96
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,880
There's no doubt he still has...

97
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,000
..some ardent supporters
both here and abroad.

98
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,800
Rumours abound on Capitol Hill
that there were...

99
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,480
- Yeah?
- Sir, we're checking our equipment.

100
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,920
Any problems with the conduit line?

101
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,800
l don't know anything about that.

102
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,640
- Would you mind if we take a look?
- Help yourself.

103
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,000
lt don't seem right somehow,
closing down this church.

104
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,800
The parish is going to keep on using it,
but it won't be the same.

105
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,320
Been here a lot of years,
and I've been right here with it.

106
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,040
Yeah, I kind of feel like...

107
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,280
..a piece of me is dying
with this church.

108
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,120
Well, you're right about that.

..but no matter how high his spirits,...

113
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,440

on drugs has taken its first prisoner.

Everyone's in position.
How's the weather?

123
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,840
We got flurries all along
the Virginia coast.

Adios.

Hey, it's cold out there, man!
I stomped my feet for five minutes.

131
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,680
Two cappuccinos. Make it fast.

132
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,880
- Scotch straight up, please.
- Excuse me, officers.

133
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,240
This may sound like a wild-goose chase,
but I think I saw...

134
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,440
Saw what?

135
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,960
Elvis. Elvis Presley.

136
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,000
Fucking tourists. Ought to be a law.

137
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,800
There's a lot from
the Justice Department here.

138
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,720
- Is there a reason for that?
- Just routine.

139
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,040
- Just routine?
- Yes.

140
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,560

- Not now.

141

Hey, that's Colonel Stuart over there.

143

Got a little problem with personnel.
Last-minute replacement.

How's the security here?

145
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,960
Like we figured... a joke.

146
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,240
Colonel Stuart,
could we have a few words?

147
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,560
You can have two: fuck and you.

148
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,240
No pictures, you pinko bitch.

149
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,160
Old news.

150
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,120
Oh! Damn it!

151
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,960
Excuse me.

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,800
Excuse me.

Thank you.

154
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,200
Hey, man.

155
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,400
- What is it?
- You got a key for this door?

156
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,960
Yeah. Why?

157
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,120
Because I want you
to open it up, that's why.

158
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,760
- Is there a cop on duty around here?
- The airport police.

159
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,200
Go get them.

160
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,320
(laughing)

161
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,000
(man) Hand me the wrench.

162
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,000
- Going to work overtime.
- (man #2) Good idea.

163
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,360
OK, hold that end.

164
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,680
Watch it, man.

165
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,920
All right. Perfect.
Perfect. Good to go.

166
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,280
Hey!

167
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,520
It's a restricted area.
What's the matter?

168
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,920
- Couldn't wait for the skycap?
- We work here.

169
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,960
Let's see some lD.

170
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,960

- Sure. No problem.

171
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,720
Oh, jeez. Fuck!

172
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,240
What is this, a tag team?

173
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,240
Agh!

174
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,840
(screaming)

175
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,720
You say he came in here
and flashed a badge?

176
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,440
Yeah. He said to bring you guys back here.

177
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,760
Ugh! Agh!

178
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,000
Aagh! Aagh! Aagh!

179
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,960
(glass breaks)

180
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,080
(bicycle bell rings)

181
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,840
Fucker!

182
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,800
Freeze!

183
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,680
Nice guess, asshole.
l'm a cop. That was the bad guy.

184
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,800
Where's your ID?

185
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,320
On its way to Cleveland?

186
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,560
No, you did not explain anything.

187
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,400
You just shoved me back here
into this cattle car.

188
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,560
Sir, you were told we were overbooked.

189
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,160
Fine. Done. I accept that.

190
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,280
But why can't I get the first-class
meal my network paid for?

191
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,160
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes. We've seen your programme.

192
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,160
Your episode, Flying Junkyards, was
an objective look at air traffic safety.

193
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,080
lt wasn't nearly as edifying as
Bimbos of the Sky, was it, Connie?

194
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,760
You think you're funny.

195
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,440
You think you're funny.

196
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,280
Fine.

197
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,600
l've got your number.

198
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,080
And I've got yours.

199
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,320
So park it, sir.

200
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,440
Fine.

201
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,680
Stewardess.

202
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,160
Mr Thornberg,...

203
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,000
..you cannot monopolise my time.

204
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,720
You cannot put me near that woman.

205
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,240
Excuse me?

206
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,960
He means he's filed
a restraining order against me.

207
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,000
l'm not allowed within 50 feet of him.

208
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,200
50 yards.

209
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,560
So by keeping me in this section,
you are violating a court order.

210
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,720
l can sue you and this airline.

211
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,120
That woman assaulted me,
and she humiliated me in public.

212
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,040
What did you do?

213
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,360
Knocked out two of his teeth.

214
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,360
Would you like some champagne?

215
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,440
Sorry, Officer McClane.
I had to check.

216
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,880
Here's your piece and shield back.

217
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,920
Thanks.

218
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,160
(reporter) Over here, officer!

219
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,400
We understand that there was shooting.

220
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,560
..the presence
of ustice Department officials?

221
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,040
Jesus!

222
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,600
What the fuck are you people...
What are you doing?

223
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,640
This is a crime scene.
You got to seal this area off.

224
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,840
That's up to the captain.

225
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,240
Maybe you better take me
up to the captain, then, huh?

226
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,640
- Where's Cochrane?
- He didn't make it.

227
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,080
You're late.

228
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,680
We ran into trouble, Colonel.

229
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,520
Some cop... killed Cochrane.
I barely got away, sir.

230
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,760
Did you accomplish your mission?

231
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,160
Yes, sir, but... Cochrane, sir.

232
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,840
Well, then the damage is minimal.
The penalty could be severe.

233
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,200
You fail me again,
and the chamber won't be empty.

234
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,080
Dismissed.

235
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,720
Miss. Miss. I can't find my dog.

236
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,560
- Miss. My dog.
- One minute, ma'am.

237
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,600
l want you to fill out this form.

238
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,480
(knock on door)

239
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,160
Who is it? Come in.

240
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,280
- Captain Lorenzo?
- Yeah.

241
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,000
- I'm John McClane...
- Yeah, I know who you are.

242
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,480
You're the asshole that just broke
seven FAA and five district regulations...

243
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,800
..running around my airport
with a gun, shooting at people.

244
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,520
What do you call that shit?

245
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,840
Self-defence.

246
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,040
What, you think that LA badge...

247
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,960
..is going to get you a free lunch
or something around here?

248
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,360
Maybe a little professional courtesy.

249
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,600
Huh! ln an airport on Christmas week?

250
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,200
You've got to be kidding.

251
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,920
OK, fuck courtesy.
How about being professional?

252
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,960
Your boys just walked away
from a crime scene.

253
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,440
You can't wrap this up in ten minutes.

254
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,960
You got to seal the area off,
dust for prints...

255
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,080
Hey, don't lecture me, hotshot.

256
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,080
l know what I'm doing.
We're going to dust it down.

257
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,400
We'll take all the pictures.
We'll sweep for fibres.

258
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,000
When will you do this?
After 400 people go through?

259
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,920
You'd be lucky to get a print
from one of your people.

260
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,680
- Shut down that area...
- Oh, shut the area down.

261
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,360
It's that simple, huh?
Just shut the area down?

262
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,360
Yeah, and I got everybody
from the Shriners' convention...

263
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,760
..to the goddamn Boy Scouts in here!

264
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,760
l got lost kids, lost dogs...

265
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,840
Not now! Later!

266
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,080
l got international diplomats.

267
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,160
l got a fucking reindeer flying in here
from the fucking petting zoo!

268
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,320
But John McClane,
he's got a little problem.

269
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,520
Let's shut down
the whole fucking airport!

270
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,520
What do you think they'll say
upstairs when I tell them that?

271
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,920
Phone and find out.

272
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,760
l don't need fucking forensics to tell me
this was some punk stealing luggage!

273
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,280
Luggage?
That punk pulled a Glock 7 on me.

274
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,680
That's a porcelain gun made in Germany.

275
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,920
lt doesn't show up
on airport x-ray machines...

276
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,880
..and costs more
than you make in a month.

277
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,000
You'd be surprised what I make in a month.

278
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,920
lf it's more than $1.98...

279
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,080
Hey, McClane, don't start
believing your own press, huh?

280
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,400
Yeah, I know all about you
and that Nakatomi thing in LA.

281
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,920
But just cos the TV thinks
you're hot shit, that don't make it so.

282
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,920
Look, you are in my little pond now,...

283
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,120
..and I am the big fish that runs it.

284
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,880
So you capped some lowlife.

285
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,920
Fine.

286
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,720
l'll send your fucking captain in LA
a fucking commendation!

287
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,680
Now, get the hell out of my office...

288
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,600
..before I have you thrown out
of my goddamn airport!

289
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,960
Hey, Carmine, let me ask you something.

290
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,400
What sets off the metal detectors first:

291
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,000
the lead in your ass
or the shit in your brains?

292
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,840
Fat fuck.

293
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,680
(man) Any ID on this guy?

294
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,720
(man #2) That's somebody else's problem.

295
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,280
Your car's ready. Sign right here.

296
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,000
l need to borrow this and this.
l'll bring it right back.

297
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,200
Hey!

298
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,240
Hey! Yo! Hold up!

299
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:53,760
Yo!

300
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Hold up, boys.

301
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,840
Hold up. We got to check something.

302
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,840
- What are you doing?
- Pretty gruesome fucking job.

303
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:07,400
All the confusion in there,
forgot to get this clown's prints.

304
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,360
Ew! Christ.

305
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,600
You're supposed to do that at the morgue.

306
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,120
Not anymore. Got a new SOP
for DOAs from the FAA.

307
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,840
(laughs) I don't think
this one's going to make it.

308
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,040
Thanks a lot.

309
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,520
(speaks Spanish)

310
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,040
(groans)

311
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,560
(rings)

312
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,120
Powell here.

313
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,600
Take that Twinkie
out of your mouth and grab a pencil.

314
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,240
(laughs) Hey, John, how are you doing?

315
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,680
Holly stood me up a day
and I'm here alone in DC...

316
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,600
..with my in-laws.

317
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,480
Eh, the old in-laws, huh?

318
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,920
They do love
their policemen son-in-laws.

319
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,560
Listen, Al, what is the fax machine
number there at the station?

320
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,560
Uh...

321
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,920
555 3212.

322
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,800
3212. Hold on a second, all right?

323
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,840
l want to send you something.

324
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,160
Excuse me.

325
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,560
You and faxes? This is a first.

326
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,040
Holly told me I should wake up
and smell the nineties.

327
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,120
- This way?
- No. That way.

328
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,520
- Wait. It's upside-down.
- lt doesn't matter.

329
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,760
OK, here it comes.

330
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,800
l'm sending you something now.

331
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,600
Hold on a second, cowboy.

332
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,560
Fingerprints?

333
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,560
We've got an unidentified stiff here.

334
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,720
l've circled the whorls in pen
in case the transmission's fuzzy.

335
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,480
Run it through State and Federal,
and if you can, lnterpol.

336
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,800
Will do. Well, what's this about?

337
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,320
Oh, just a feeling I have.

338
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,640
Ouch. When you get those feelings,
insurance companies start to go bankrupt.

339
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,440
Listen, the, uh, fax number is...

340
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,280
On the top of the transmission...

341
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,360
On the top of the transmission you just got.

342
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,920
Oh, an airport, huh?

343
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,960
You're not pissing
in somebody's pool, are you?

344
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,280
(laughs)
Yeah, and I'm fresh out of chlorine.

345
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,400
Just as this storm starts breaking,...

346
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,720
..the satellite will feed up
and drop the other shoe.

347
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,760
Look at this new front moving in.

348
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,760
Makes its baby brother
look like chicken shit.

349
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,720
l can sand down the runway
and run the ploughs between landings...

350
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,240
..if you downshift them,
give me time to work.

351
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,320
You got it.

352
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,760
All right, everyone.

353
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:24,320
Let's slow down our birds before
we get a parking lot over our heads.

354
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,800
The line starts at the Mississippi,...

355
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,440
..and they better start taking numbers.

356
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,880
Can I get you another?

357
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,160
No, thank you.

358
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,080
l only have to look at his face
for another 20 minutes.

359
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,040
(PA) Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.

360
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,760
l've just been informed
by Dulles traffic control...

361
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,960
..that there's a weather front ahead of us.

362
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,480
We maybe up here
a little while longer.

363
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,040
Thank you.

364
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,880
On second thoughts...

365
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,320
- (rings)
- Al?

366
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,320
Hey, I'm right here, partner.

367
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,120
Your stiff's dossier is
coming through now.

368
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,440
- What can you tell me about him?
- He's dead.

369
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,560
You needed a computer
to figure that out?

370
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,480
No, no. You don't follow me.

371
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,480
According to the Department Of Defence,
he's been dead for two years.

372
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,920
What?

373
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,680
That's right.
Sergeant Oswald Cochrane.

374
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,360
American adviser in Honduras.

375
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,840
Killed in a helicopter accident 5-11-88.

376
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,520
Officer.

377
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,800
Read between the lines, and I'd say
it looks like a lot of black-bag stuff.

378
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,240
Yeah, I see it.

379
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,680
- All right, Al. Thanks a lot.
- Hey, any time.

380
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,080
OK.

381
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,840
Say, I close in about an hour.
Maybe we can go get a drink?

382
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,200
Just the fax, ma'am. Just the fax.

383
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,120
Hey, wait a second. I see somebody.
l'll call you back.

384
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,480
The ghost of Christmas past.

385
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,080
Nakatomi? LA?
You're John McClane, right?

386
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,760
- Who are you?
- Sam Coleman.

387
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,680
WNTW News.

388
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,080
Excuse me.

389
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
Give me a break. I saw the stiff.

390
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,680
Word is that was your handiwork.

391
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,080
No. I only do needlepoint.

392
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,640
Great. National just shut down.
Totally iced.

393
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,520
They'll send us their planes.

394
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,760
Happy, happy holiday.

395
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,120
The worst part, Mr Trudeau,
was the press.

396
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,640
They were here for the Esperanza story,...

397
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,360
..so they got it right on the fucking news,
bloodstains and all.

398
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,320
I'd like to lock every damn reporter
out of the airport,...

399
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,120
..but they'd pull
that freedom-of-speech crap on us.

400
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,040
Then the ACLU would be all over us.

401
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,000
Murder on television.
Hell of a start for Christmas week.

402
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,560
What is it?
A gang thing like last time?

403
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,400
Only if your gangs get
their training at Fort Bragg.

404
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,400
- Who the hell is this?
- Uh-uh, McClane.

405
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,320
- I'm a police officer...
- ln an unauthorised area.

406
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,200
LA, Mr Trudeau, don't mean shit.

407
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,880
That's what I said about
my last cholesterol test.

408
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,520
So what's your problem,
Lieutenant McClane?

409
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,920
l'm sure Captain Lorenzo explained...

410
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,200
..the minor fracas with the minor thieves.

411
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,440
Maybe he can explain this.

412
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,120
All systems tapped, Colonel.

413
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,400
Fire it up.

414
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,400
H minus five minutes. Stand by.

415
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,280
OK, we've got a body in the morgue
that seems to have died twice.

416
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,920
Assuming it's not a computer error,
what do we assume?

417
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,240
That somebody's about
to fuck with this airport.

418
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,240
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

419
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,040
l know we're dummies up here,
so give us a taste of your genius.

420
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,320
This is a hijacking, a robbery or what?

421
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,880
- Look, I'm not sure...
- Oh, he's not sure. I'm stunned!

422
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,320
l got to lie down.

423
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,520
Only professionals go to this much trouble.

424
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,360
Not luggage thieves and not punks.

425
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,160
- Professional at what?
- What the fuck do you think this is?

426
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,280
The safety patrol?

427
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,280
This is the résumé
of a professional mercenary.

428
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,320
The world's biggest drug dealer
is due here.

429
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,000
You need a slide rule to solve this,...

430
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,000
..or another body in a bag
before you ask questions?

431
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,280
You're the one that gave us
that fucking body. Remember that.

432
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,800
Yeah, I remember that.

433
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,600
Lorenzo, have all your shift
commanders report in. Now.

434
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,720
You're not buying into this?!

435
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,240
They're to report anything unusual,
however trivial. Got that?

436
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,360
Yeah, I got it.

437
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,720
- Oh, my God!
- What?

438
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,040
- The runways.
- What the hell?

439
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,560
- They're shutting down.
- Jesus Christ.

440
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,640
Go to emergency lighting now.

441
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,560
Emergency. We are in a code yellow.

442
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,400
Backup systems won't come up.

443
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,280
- Shunt to another terminal.
- Bobby, what have you got?

444
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,880
- Nothing. The network is down.
- Should we call the power company?

445
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,720
We're on the same goddamn grid.
We're hot.

446
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,640
(radio)
Dulles, what's going on? I'm on approach.

447
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,960
- Maintain position. Repeat.
- What's going on down there?

448
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,280
Roger. We're on it.

449
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,920
- We're unable right now. Delay.
- Fuji 604.

450
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Execute published missed-approach
procedure and hold.

451
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,600
TWA 23, unable to clear you
for approach at this time.

452
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,200
Climb to and maintain one zero thousand.

453
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,360
l've checked all systems.
lt ain't happening.

454
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

455
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,120
- What's it look like?
- Approach control, it's gone.

456
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,280
Jesus!
lnstrument landing system is down.

457
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,520
Confirmed. lLS is dead.

458
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,960
Every goddamn system's dead.

459
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,560
And INMAC monitors are down.

460
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,400
Attention all controllers.
Attention. We have a code-red alert.

461
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,240
(PA) Every aircraft approaching our sector...

462
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,280
..and not already in our landing pattern...

463
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,440
..gets diverted to their alternate airport.

464
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,400
Everyone already on approach
or inside our pattern...

465
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,800
..holds at the outer markers.

466
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,480
Stack 'em, pack 'em, and rack 'em.

467
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,720
Move.

468
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,200
Get someone on it!

469
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,520
(beeping)

470
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,880
All right.
Not a word of this leaves this room.

471
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,440
There must be 15,000 people
in this airport,...

472
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,040
..and we don't need panic.

473
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,040
We just bought ourselves
maybe two hours.

474
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,960
After that,
planes low on fuel won't be circling.

475
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,600
They'll be dropping
on the White House lawn.

476
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,520
McClane, is this what you expected?

477
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,720
No.

478
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
This is just the beginning.

479
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,720
(beeping)

480
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,040
FAA hot line.

481
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,760
How could they know already?

482
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,120
They can't.

483
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,880
Maybe it's the boys
who pulled your plugs.

484
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,800
Put it on speaker.

485
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,040
(speaker)
Attention, Dulles tower. Attention.

486
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,520
They say blindmen become very
attentive by way of compensation.

487
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,240
Now that you're blind and deaf,
I think I've got your attention.

488
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,560
l'm aware your recorders are active,
so I'll be quick.

489
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,720
You can play me back later
to your heart's content.

490
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,200
How did you get on this line?
Who is this?

491
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,760
Who I am is unimportant.

492
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,000
What I want...

493
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,000
Well, if you don't want those planes
to start splashing into the Potomac...

494
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,840
..as they run out of fuel,
what I want is very important.

495
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,320
A plane will be landing
at this airport in 58 minutes.

496
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,560
lt is FM-1: Foreign Military One.

497
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:20,320
- I'm sure you are aware of the nature...
- Esperanza?

498
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,760
..of this flight, the importance of its cargo.

499
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,880
This plane will not be met by anyone.

500
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,880
lt will land on a runway
of my designation,...

501
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,320
..where it will remain
isolated and unapproached.

502
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,800
That will conclude
my interest in this aircraft...

503
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,560
..and your responsibility for it.

504
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,480
At the same time,
I want a 747 cargo conversion,...

505
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,560
..fully fuelled...

506
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,800
..and placed at my disposal.

507
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,280
You have two more minutes
to advise inbound aircraft...

508
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,720
..to hold at their outer radio marker.

509
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:52,560
After that,
you willbe able to receive only.

510
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:55,360
Any attempt to restore your systems,
will be met...

511
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,120
..by severe penalties.

512
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,240
He's bluffing.

513
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,760
Damn it, you can't do this.

514
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,840
l am doing this.

515
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,840
OK, listen up.
I need you to punch up a code 15.

516
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,920
l got an idea, and I need your help.

517
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,680
lf Esperanza gets to a country...

518
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,240
..with no extradition treaties,
we're fucked.

519
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,400
They're talking to us on our own system.
They got to be close.

520
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,360
My men will tear this airport apart.

521
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,120
Just in the nick of time, huh?

522
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,640
l got a first-class unit here,
SWAT team and all.

523
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,280
We don't need
any Monday-morning quarterbacks.

524
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,040
My wife's on one of the planes
they're fucking with!

525
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,640
So I'm on the playing field.

526
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,400
lf you'd have moved your fat ass before,
we wouldn't be deep in shit now.

527
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,760
That's it. Security. You're out of here.

528
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,880
Mr Trudeau, there are FAA regulations...

529
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,960
..regarding unauthorised personnel
in the control tower!

530
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,960
We just have to find a way to transmit.

531
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,680
Somebody want to run
to Radio Shack for a transmitter?

532
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,240
We have one -
the terminal wing they're building.

533
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,920
20 airlines when it's done,...

534
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,320
..all with reservation computers
in a nice antenna arrangement.

535
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,000
- See Mr McClane out.
- You got no business being up here.

536
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,680
Everything we need
is by the annexe skywalk...

537
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,280
..just sitting there, waiting to go on line.

538
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,880
God dammit, Trudeau,
you're dealing with pros.

539
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,800
You can't fuck with these people!

540
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,360
Sam Coleman. WNTW News.

541
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,040
There are a lot of rumours flying around.

542
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,360
No way. No way, lady.
Hell, no. No.

543
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,520
This is off limits, Coleman.

544
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,200
(Captain) Get them out of here!

545
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,760
Anything you can think of,
they'll think of, too!

546
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,640
Get your fucking hands off me.

547
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,560
(Captain) Just get them out of here.

548
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,760
Lobby security,...

549
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,600
- ..come in.
- Tomalson here.

550
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,280
This is Captain Lorenzo.

551
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,480
We've two unauthorised personnel
in the tower.

552
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,360
Would you get your thumb
out of your ass?

553
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,160
Get them out of the elevator,
or you'll get a pink slip for Christmas.

554
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,640
10-4. Let's go.

555
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,440
Goddamn!

556
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,760
Anything who can think of?
Can't fuck with who?

557
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,160
Shit. Hang on over there.

558
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,360
- What for?
- Just hang on!

559
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,600
Big drug dealer on his way to prison.

560
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,360
Gunfight at airport.

561
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,280
Every controller in the coffee shop
getting beeped,...

562
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,720
..and you rocking the boat.

563
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,280
Connection? Come on, McClane.
Just a few words.

564
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,960
OK, just a few words. Fuck off.

565
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,120
Thanks, but I already got
that from Colonel Stuart.

566
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,720
Stuart. The guy that got canned
by Congress. That's who he was.

567
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,320
Who he who? What? Hey...

568
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,640
Shh! It's OK, I've done this before.

569
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,160
- Hey.
- Hi.

570
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,040
- Where's the other one?
- Claustrophobic, I guess.

571
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,640
It's a VHF system,
but the planes are so close, it's OK.

572
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,680
l can rig our frequency in 30 minutes,
and wire in a crossover.

573
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,080
Even the planes wouldn't
know the difference.

574
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,880
Get what you need.
Borrow. Steal. Kill.

575
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,160
l want my SWAT team
to go with him as cover.

576
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,880
Whatever we can think of,
they can think of, too.

577
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,680
Oh, man. I can't fucking believe this.

578
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,040
Another basement. Another elevator.

579
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,360
How can the same shit happen
to the same guy twice?

580
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,160
(distant music)

581
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,760
(What the fuck?)

582
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,840
# Old Cape Cod

583
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,200
# lfyou like the taste of a lobster stew

584
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,520
# Served by a window with an ocean view

585
00:38:54,120 --> 00:39:00,800
# You're sure to fall in love
with Old Cape Cod

586
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,400
Who are you?

587
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,480
l'm Marvin. Marvin. I'm Marvin.

588
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,120
l thought you was trying
to steal my records.

589
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,120
l'm just the janitor.

590
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,200
This is Dulles approach to all aircraft...

591
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,200
..holding at Potomac vortex.

592
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,880
We are experiencing
some technical problems.

593
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,000
Weather conditions,
which have deteriorated...

594
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:34,400
..have now been complicated
by an unforeseen human factor.

595
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:38,040
This has affected all
of our electronic equipment...

596
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,120
..and their redundant backups.

597
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,760
As a result, our nav
and approach systems are down.

598
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,080
We expect to lose
voice in another minute.

599
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,520
We want you to continue...

600
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,400
..holding at the outer marker
as directed...

601
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,400
..and wait for further instructions.

602
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,440
As soon as we're back on line,...

603
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,600
..we'll expedite your landings
on a fuel-emergency basis.

604
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,000
Good luck.

605
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,400
God bless.

606
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,000
OK, change the boards.

607
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,640
(muttering)

608
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
(phone rings)

609
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,840
Hey, stand back.

610
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,360
- The skywalk annexe.
- No! The annexe skywalk.

611
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,720
It's the last thing I heard
before they kicked me out.

612
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,960
Well, let me see here, now.

613
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,760
Well, this must be it right there.

614
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:54,400
See? That's the raised platform
and there's the new terminal.

615
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,880
There's your skywalk.

616
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,200
Goddamn bottleneck.
Nice place for an ambush.

617
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:03,640
What's the fastest way
you can get me out to that spot?

618
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:09,360
This kind of thing wasn't
in my job description.

619
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,360
- Mr Barnes, we'll watch your back.
- Yeah? Who watches yours?

620
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,080
Main ventilation duct.

621
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,360
Ventilation duct...

622
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,720
..and bingo.

623
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,960
Just once,...

624
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,320
..I'd like a regular, normal Christmas.

625
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,720
Eggnog, a fucking Christmas tree,...

626
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,720
..a little turkey.

627
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,200
But, no!

628
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,040
l got to crawl around
in this motherfucking tin can!

629
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,280
We're in the annexe skywalk.
I can see the array.

630
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,280
l'll give you a call
for a protocol test when it's hot.

631
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,480
That's all for now.

632
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,960
(Barnes)
Sergeant, we need more equipment.

633
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,880
I'd like to send one
of your guys for it.

634
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,680
Right, sir. You got it.

635
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,720
What the hell?

636
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,480
What the hell's going on?

637
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,600
Hey! Put that back on!

638
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,240
Hey, asshole,
what do I look like to you?

639
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,640
A sitting duck.

640
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,320
Take him!

641
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:25,840
Shit!

642
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,640
Damn it. I hate it when I'm right.

643
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,480
Look out! Get down!

644
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:49,160
Aagh!

645
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,720
Aagh!

646
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,960
(gunfire)

647
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,920
(gunfire stops)

648
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,320
Stay down!

649
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,800
Fuck!

650
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,120
Come on.

651
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
Fucking son of a bitch.

652
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,560
Aagh!

653
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,080
Shit.

654
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,080
Agh! Ugh!

655
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:31,000
l'm going to kick your fucking ass.

656
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,760
- Jeez.
- You all right?

657
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,640
Yeah. But the antenna array,...
I got to get to it and set it up.

658
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,480
Get down!

659
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,120
(Goddamn.)

660
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,880
Bait.

661
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,880
Jerk us off.

662
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,400
Make Lorenzo sacrifice his best men.

663
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,600
Make you waste your time,...

664
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,200
..time we don't have.

665
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,120
l think you're closer than 50 yards.

666
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,600
So's that airplane. Practically.

667
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,800
Yeah. There's quite a few of them.

668
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,840
lt looks like a regular traffic jam.

669
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,800
There's nothing regular about it.

670
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:25,280
See? You're intrigued.

671
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,920
That's my gift, Mrs McClane.
I notice things.

672
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,560
Things other people wouldn't see.
That's how I make people curious.

673
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,400
Don't you mean nauseous?

674
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,640
Look. The people have a right
to know everything about everybody.

675
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,720
You got in the way ofthat.

676
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,520
Listen, buster.
You endangered my children.

677
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,440
You didn't do it
for anything as noble as the people.

678
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,160
The only time you see the people,...

679
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,760
..is when you look down to see
what you're stepping on.

680
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,400
Me? Yeah, I'll live.

681
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,560
But Lorenzo's SWAT team is dead,...

682
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,040
..and the antenna array is gone.

683
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,200
- (beeping)
- Didn't you see it?!

684
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,000
It's hard looking for a new miracle.

685
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:12,280
(Barnes) Hold for a minute.
l'll be right back.

686
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,360
Hold for a second.
Something's going on.

687
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,280
Yeah. Just hold on for a minute.

688
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,160
l say again, annexe team,
give us a sitrep.

689
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,320
Annexe team, come in. Do you copy?

690
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,200
It's got a scrambler on it.

691
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,480
Can you do anything with it?

692
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,440
No. This scramble mode
must activate on this code panel.

693
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:37,520
Even if we scan their frequency,
we can't listen in.

694
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,520
- These guys are pros.
- So are you. Break the code.

695
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,600
l want to hear
what these bastards are saying.

696
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,240
This is a ten-digit control panel.
Six-digit read-out.

697
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,840
Hell, there could be
a million combinations.

698
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,720
Next time you kill one of these guys,
get him to enter the code first.

699
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,920
Yeah.

700
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,320
Sir, we just monitored a call
from their Chief Engineer.

701
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,880
We took out their SWAT team,
completely.

702
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,600
You were right.
They went for the antenna array.

703
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,240
- We're on schedule.
- Losing our team wasn't part of the plan.

704
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,880
Attention, Dulles tower.

705
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,600
Attention, Dulles control tower.

706
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,640
Mr Trudeau, I know you're listening.

707
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,320
- Unfortunately, you're not obeying.
- Try me face to face.

708
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,240
You were warned
not to restore your systems.

709
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,960
You've wasted lives and precious time
on a futile and obvious target.

710
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,720
Now you're going to pay the penalty.

711
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,880
l've got five dead officers, Colonel Stuart.

712
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,640
lsn't that penalty enough?

713
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,400
McClane, keep out of this.
You've been a pain...

714
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,880
(Stuart) Oh, McClane.

715
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,960
John McClane.

716
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,040
The policeman hero who saved
the Nakatomi hostages.

717
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,880
l read about you in People magazine.

718
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,120
You seemed out of your league on Nightline.

719
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,600
Hey, Colonel, blow me.

720
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,360
How much drug money is Esperanza
paying you to turn traitor?

721
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,160
Cardinal Richelieu said it best:
''Treason is merely a matter of dates''.

722
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:03,120
This country's got to learn
it can't keep cutting the legs off...

723
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,400
..of men like General Esperanza.

724
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,800
Men who have the guts to stand up
against communist aggression.

725
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,880
And lesson one starts
with killing policemen?

726
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,440
What's lesson two, the neutron bomb?

727
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,320
No. I think we can find
something in between.

728
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,080
Watch this.

729
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,400
Give me a flight number.
One that's low on fuel.

730
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,320
Windsor 114.
Transatlantic from London.

731
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,000
Fuel tank's dry as a martini.

732
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:36,320
Activate the ILS landing system,
but recalibrate sea level...

733
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:39,840
..minus 200 feet.

734
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,680
Oh, Jesus! They've reset
ground level, minus 200 feet.

735
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,160
(Stuart) Windsor flight 114.

736
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,400
This is Dulles approach.

737
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,160
Do you copy?

738
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,640
Dulles approach, this is Windsor 114.

739
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:17,800
- Where the devil have you been?
- Windsor 114.

740
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,720
We've been right here all along, old buddy.

741
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,200
Our systems have only just
came back on line.

742
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,320
Windsor 114,
you are cleared for ILS approach,...

743
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,800
..runway two-niner.

744
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,640
Contact Dulles tower frequency
at the outer marker.

745
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,920
Jesus Christ,
he's gonna crash the plane!

746
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,520
Roger, approach, and about time.

747
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,560
l've got 230 people up here
flying on petrol fumes.

748
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:40,080
Roger, 114. Understand.

749
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,560
- Calibrate Dulles altimeter...
- Oh, Jesus.

750
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,560
They'll fly right into the concrete.

751
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,080
Son of a bitch!

752
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,040
Why are they listening to him?

753
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,960
- It's our frequency!
- Dulles, this is Windsor 114.

754
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,840
Barnes!

755
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,240
This is Dulles tower.
We have radar contact...

756
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,000
- Give me your coat!
- Windsor 114, standby...

757
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,080
What are you going to do?

758
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,720
Whatever I can.

759
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,440
Ladies and gentlemen,
we've started our descent.

760
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,440
We're sorry for the inconvenience,...

761
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,240
..but we'll all be on the ground shortly.
Thank you.

762
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,240
Please keep your seat belts on.

763
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,040
We've made arrangements
for your next flight,...

764
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,040
..so you won't miss it, OK?

765
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,000
ln your seat, please.
Come on, in your seat.

766
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,680
Oh, hey.
We're just like British Rail, love.

767
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,080
We may be late, but we get you there.

768
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,760
Don't worry.

769
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,480
Good luck, McClane!

770
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,880
(beeping)

771
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,040
Dulles, this is Windsor 114
inside the outer marker.

772
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,600
Roger, 114. This is Dulles tower.

773
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,000
We have radar contact
and show you on lLS.

774
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,560
You're in the glide path
and looking good.

775
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,440
There's somebody out there!

776
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,800
It's McClane.

777
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,640
Christ.

778
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,920
Approach flaps.

779
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,720
Approach flaps.

780
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:51,680
- Approach speed 140.
- Approach speed 140.

781
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,280
- 130.
- 130.

782
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,400
Altitude 1,000 feet.

783
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,640
800, guys! You're only at 800 feet!

784
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,880
(radio) Fire and rescue.
Roll everything onto runway two-niner!

785
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,400
(aircraft captain) Ref speed plus 20.

786
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,280
600 feet.

787
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,880
Looking good, Windsor.

788
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,440
Now, watch it.

789
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,320
30-knot crosswinds,
and the runway is icy.

790
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,320
Attaboy. We've got you.

791
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,800
We've got you.

792
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,480
Pull it up!

793
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,240
Jesus!

794
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:48,760
- Aagh! We're going to die!
- We've got you.

795
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,000
God.

796
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,080
Motherfucker.

797
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,400
Motherfucker.

798
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,360
(man) Oh, Jesus.

799
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:45,520
That concludes our object lesson
for this evening.

800
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,880
lf the 747 we requested
is ready on time...

801
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,200
..and General Esperanza's plane
arrives unmolested,...

802
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,200
..further lessons can be avoided.

803
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,280
Out.

804
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,960
(woman crying)

805
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,360
(sirens)

806
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,640
(yelling)

807
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,200
We got no sign of survivors down here.

808
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,880
It's a goddamn nightmare.

809
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,920
Hey, Nelson! Come here.

810
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,680
Barnes!

811
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,600
We've got to warn those planes
there's a lunatic pretending he's the tower.

812
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,960
- Get me on the air.
- How?

813
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,320
You figure it out!

814
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,840
Here's the manifest.

815
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,760
McClane, I know how you must feel.

816
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,600
l wanted to help those people.

817
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,400
l was pretty goddamn useless.

818
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,400
We called the government for help.

819
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:51,200
They're going to send in
a Special army unit.

820
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,280
A counterterrorist team.

821
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,520
Your wife's plane...

822
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,880
They're still broadcasting,
even though we can't answer.

823
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,880
They're going to run
out offuel in 90 minutes.

824
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,160
Listen, Dick. That is your name?

825
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,800
Dick.

826
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,600
lf you're going
to continue to get this close,...

827
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:31,600
..could you switch aftershaves?

828
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,720
Anything else?

829
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:37,720
Stronger mouthwash might be nice.

830
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:41,120
(TV) And here's Sam Coleman
reporting live from the accident.

831
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,200
Colonel, they've done
everything we've anticipated...

832
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,000
..so far.

833
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,680
(TV)
But still there has been no official word.

834
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,040
Despite the fact that only one runway
has been closed due to the tragedy,...

835
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:56,320
..several dozen airliners are visible,
endlessly circling the field.

836
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,480
Other reports say there was trouble
in the tower before the crash...

837
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:03,200
..and that that may have contributed to it.

838
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,440
With weather conditions worsening,...

839
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,920
..the problem here
and in the sky will grow.

840
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,280
l'm Samantha Coleman
at Dulles lnternational Airport.

841
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,960
Victor. Victor.

842
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,480
- Victor.
- Yeah, what's up?

843
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:24,320
Did you pack the radio mikes
from the shoot or are they here?

844
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,320
l wouldn't let those assholes
check them in!

845
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,560
l love you.

846
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,680
Give me one of the receivers.

847
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,280
Can you tune into
the cockpit frequency?

848
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:40,280
- Yeah. Why?
- I want to hear what's going on.

849
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,320
Should be right here on our band.

850
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,280
Nothing.

851
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,280
You said it would work.
ls it working or not ?

852
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,440
lt is working, but all I'm getting
is some kind of airport beacon.

853
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,440
It's weird. It's like the tower isn't there.

854
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,000
Stay on it.

855
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,760
Let me know when
there is something there.

856
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,960
OK.

857
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,240
Major Grant. We're Blue Light.

858
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,000
Rollins, Department Of Justice.

859
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,000
Trudeau, Chief Of Air Operations.

860
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:47,600
Lorenzo, Terminal Police.

861
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,520
You want something, you got it.

862
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,520
This is it? One fucking platoon?

863
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,880
One crisis, one platoon. Who are you?

864
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,000
John McClane.

865
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,800
McClane, you showed
some balls out there, man.

866
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,400
Yeah.

867
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,800
Now show some good sense.
Let the pros handle this.

868
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,360
l think the pros
are on the wrong team tonight.

869
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,240
lsn't Colonel Stuart one of your men?

870
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,760
No, not anymore, he's not.

871
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,920
We're here to take Colonel Stuart down.

872
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,160
And we will take him down.

873
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,320
l served with him.
I taught him everything he knows.

874
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,080
Well, maybe he's learned
a few more things since then.

875
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,440
Let's hustle!

876
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,640
The command post will be set up
in the airport police station.

877
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,640
l want to be tied into the tower
in 15 minutes.

878
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,360
All right, let's do it!

879
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,520
Hey, Trudeau.

880
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,320
Did things just get better or worse?

881
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,360
Lights. Big, portable lights.

882
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,400
We set up the field, and then we...

883
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,520
Wait for those lunatics
to shoot them out?

884
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,000
Where do we get those lights?

885
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:51,520
What about the air phone idea?

886
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:55,240
There's 18 planes up there.
Only five of them have those phones.

887
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,600
We got through to three.
We're trying the others.

888
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,280
That's 13 potential accidents.

889
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,280
Are they still bucking headwinds?

890
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,360
Headwinds are slamming
everybody over the outer marker.

891
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:04,800
The planes with enough fuel...

892
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,560
..have been shunted
to Atlanta, Memphis and Nashville.

893
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,680
Outer marker.

894
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,680
Damn!

895
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,520
The outer marker!

896
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,400
It's a beacon, right?
lt sends out this beep beep beep...

897
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,080
..so they know they're over it.

898
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,400
- So?
- Who says that signal has to beep?

899
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,400
We switch the frequency from
the tower to the one in the beacon.

900
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:25,920
We pump up the wattage.

901
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
We can talk to our planes, and
those bastards who did this won't know!

902
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,120
Traced the signal.
Found it in the luggage area.

903
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,160
They've been tapped into
your tower chatter all night.

904
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:40,680
Punks stealing luggage, huh, Carmine?

905
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,680
- How you doing, Telford?
- No good. I called Lang.

906
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,360
They'll have a portable decoder
here in two hours.

907
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,280
My wife doesn't have two hours.

908
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,360
l was put on Grant's team yesterday.

909
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:55,360
The regular guy got appendicitis.

910
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,160
Word is, nobody's better
at this than Major Grant.

911
01:02:58,240 --> 01:02:59,400
Attention!

912
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,480
Except maybe Colonel Stuart.

913
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,160
l want to hear about
the plane those bastards asked for.

914
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:09,840
Then I'll fill you in on my orders.
Pilots' Briefing Room. Now!

915
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:10,880
Keep working.

916
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,200
Albertson. With me.

917
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,680
No civilians.

918
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,760
- What the fuck... ?
- What is it?

919
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,480
The outer marker beeper.
lt isn't beeping. It's talking.

920
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,840
(radio) Attention,
all aircraftin Dulles landing pattern.

921
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,040
This is Chief Engineer, Leslie Barnes.

922
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,320
l have been authorised
to brief you in full.

923
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:49,480
At this time, this is the only
channel available to us.

924
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,680
Here is the situation.

925
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,760
Approximately two hours ago...

926
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,120
Get a load of this.

927
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:01,040
Do not accept instructions
claiming to be from our tower...

928
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:03,680
..unless you hear
your flight recorderaccess code.

929
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,760
- The terrorists have got all...
- Holy shit!

930
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,880
- ..our systems and...
- Get this on tape!

931
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,920
..have control of everything
except this channel.

932
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,200
Give us a second here, please.

933
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,680
This channel is secure.
Your own transmissions are not.

934
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:18,640
Do not attempt to reply on your
own frequencies to this broadcast.

935
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,040
These people have already
caused one crash...

936
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:23,240
- ..by impersonating our tower.
- Jesus.

937
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,080
Repeat. The terrorists have cut off...

938
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,240
..the two systems that allowyou to land:

939
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:42,520
field lights fora visual landing
and the ILS for an instrument.

940
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:46,320
A Special US Army unitis here,
preparing to take out the terrorists.

941
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,800
- My God.
- Don't accept any instructions...

942
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,840
- Yo, Marvin.
- Hey, you interested in a nice coat?

943
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,160
No. lt never looked good on me anyway.

944
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,880
You've got to get me
to the Pilots' Briefing Room.

945
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:58,920
l've got to hear what they're saying.

946
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,320
- Which map gets me in there?
- Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

947
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,960
- Find the map, Marvin.
- I'll find it.

948
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:06,080
You'll mess up my whole
damn filing system.

949
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,120
Pilots' Briefing Room,
I think that's in the main terminal.

950
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:12,720
So would that be under P
for Pilots' Briefing Room?

951
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:16,640
- Now, Marvin!
- Or maybe under M for Miscellaneous.

952
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,760
- (beeping)
- Oh, shit!

953
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:25,280
(radio) Requestpermission
to reduce sentry duty to 30-minute rotation.

954
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:27,520
My men are getting coldandantsy.
Over.

955
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:32,120
This is Colonel Stuart. Assemble
the men not on watch fora briefing.

956
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,320
- Roger.
- What's the matter?

957
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,040
Oh!

958
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,680
Gentlemen,...

959
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,840
..tonight the pattern ends.

960
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,240
The dominoes will fall no more,...

961
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,440
..and the ramparts will remain upright.

962
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,240
Sir, General Esperanza's plane
is on the scope.

963
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,440
Attention, Dulles tower.

964
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,640
We will be lighting up a runway.

965
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,120
Do not, repeat,
do not attempt to land any planes.

966
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:05,040
Remember, we're monitoring you.

967
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:09,520
What do we do?

968
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,360
Obey.

969
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,480
Dulles tower to Foxtrot Michael One.

970
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,640
Dulles tower...

971
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,400
..to Foxtrot Michael One.

972
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,680
This is Foxtrot Michael One, Dulles.
We read you. Over.

973
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,040
Foxtrot Michael One,
you are to come in on runway...

974
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:31,440
..1-5, repeat, 1-5.

975
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:48,640
l found it on the floor,
by the coat, next to the luggage belt.

976
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,360
What the hell you so excited for?

977
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,480
The code's still punched into this one.

978
01:06:52,560 --> 01:06:53,960
You like it, huh?

979
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:56,000
How about giving me 20 bucks for it?

980
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,240
How about I let you live?

981
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,720
The man knows how to bargain.

982
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,160
This is contrary to our instructions.

983
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:06,920
We are to land at runway 1-0,...

984
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,200
..where we are to be met
by representatives of your Justice...

985
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,040
Captain, please tell the tower
you will proceed as ordered.

986
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,840
Roger, Dulles.

987
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:30,320
Proceeding to runway 1-5.

988
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,600
(yelling)

989
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,520
(gunshots)

990
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,640
Foxtrot Michael One. Come in, please.

991
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:51,880
What are you going to do now?
Are you going to shoot me?

992
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,280
So who will fly the plane?

993
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,560
Don't worry about it.
It's not your problem.

994
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,520
(plane descending)

995
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,400
Michael One. Do you copy?

996
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:10,600
Foxtrot Michael One. Come in, please.

997
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:16,360
(beep)

998
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:18,880
(beeping)

999
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,320
Eagle Nest.

1000
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,120
This is Falcon. Mayday.

1001
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:25,160
Eagle Nest. This is Falcon. Mayday!

1002
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,400
Go ahead, Falcon.

1003
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:31,440
l've lost cabin pressure.
Near-zero visibility.

1004
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,280
l must drop out
of this weather and land now,...

1005
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,240
..on the first accessible runway.

1006
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,520
Repeat.

1007
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,440
l've lost cabin pressure.
Near-zero visibility.

1008
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:42,440
l must drop out of the storm.

1009
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:46,720
l can land, but I must land now,
on the first outgoing runway.

1010
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:50,480
Repeat.
I cannot circle around to runway 1-5.

1011
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:55,720
l'll make you a deal, Marvin.

1012
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,600
Show me a shortcut to those runways,...

1013
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,480
..and I'll get you a liner for that coat.

1014
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:02,640
Repeat. I cannot circle
around to runway 1-5.

1015
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,920
(Shit.) Stand by, Falcon.

1016
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,400
Here, sir.
He's coming in from the ocean.

1017
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,920
(Esperanza)
A bullet has damaged my instruments.

1018
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,880
l'm not sure of my bearings,...

1019
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,160
..and I must make
a visual landing immediately.

1020
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,960
- Do you copy, Eagle Nest?
- Roger, Falcon.

1021
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,800
(radio) That would be 2-5 right.

1022
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:25,040
Repeat. 2-5 right.

1023
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:28,240
Make up your fucking mind!

1024
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:31,040
We are just up to our ass
in terrorists again, John.

1025
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:33,120
Affirmative. 2-5 right. Over.

1026
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:34,840
2-5 right.

1027
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,520
l've got to quit smoking cigarettes.

1028
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,800
(Esperanza)
Thank you for telling me, Eagle Nest.

1029
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,040
But if you could show it to me as well,...

1030
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,840
..l would be grateful.

1031
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,520
l see the lights.
They are directly in front of me.

1032
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,040
Gracias, compadre.

1033
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,920
Reducing airspeed.
Approaching runway.

1034
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:05,960
- Wish me luck.
- Roger, Falcon.

1035
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,280
We copy.
We'll have you in five minutes.

1036
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,520
That's right, asshole.
We'll have you in five minutes.

1037
01:10:35,160 --> 01:10:37,040
(Stuart) I see your lights.

1038
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:38,920
ETA 90 seconds.

1039
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,480
Come to papa, scumbag.

1040
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,920
(groans)

1041
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:43,680
Oh, shit!

1042
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:55,480
No!

1043
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,560
Freedom.

1044
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,440
Not yet.

1045
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,240
(cocks gun)

1046
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:50,840
You should stay in your seat
until the plane reaches the terminal.

1047
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,800
No frequent-flier mileage for you.

1048
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:55,080
- Who are you?
- A cop.

1049
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,920
- A cop?
- Yeah, one of the good guys.

1050
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,320
You're one of the bad guys.

1051
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,440
Now I've got your sorry ass,
l'm going to trade it for my wife.

1052
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,600
(gunfire)

1053
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:11,440
Sit down!

1054
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:16,600
Go in!

1055
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,920
- Where did he go?
- ln there.

1056
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,320
(Esperanza) I don't believe this.

1057
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,520
Two months of planning,...

1058
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,440
..and you can't anticipate
one pendejo of a cop.

1059
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,600
- Come on, General.
- Where is Colonel Stuart?

1060
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,560
- General!
- I'm all right.

1061
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,520
He said he was a policeman.
I thought you had this place secured.

1062
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:53,720
- He went in the cockpit.
- He's going to hell!

1063
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:55,640
McClane!

1064
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:58,760
l assume it's you, McClane.

1065
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,440
You're quite a little soldier.

1066
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,720
You can consider this a military funeral!

1067
01:14:20,840 --> 01:14:22,840
Aaagh!

1068
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,440
- How many grenades we got?
- Three each!

1069
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,400
Use them!

1070
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:45,040
Oh, fuck.

1071
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,080
Go!

1072
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,200
Aaagh!

1073
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,600
Oh, shit!

1074
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,640
You lucky fuck.

1075
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,080
(sirens)

1076
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,320
Fire trucks, sir.

1077
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,720
Fall back to the church. Now!

1078
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,320
Where's the fucking door?

1079
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,200
(beep)

1080
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,040
They're getting a little
nervous back there.

1081
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,480
ln fact, so am l.

1082
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:16,760
We're over Washington.

1083
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,120
See if you can get any TV
to settle them down.

1084
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,960
Works for me. I'll...

1085
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:23,960
(beeping)

1086
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:47,480
Writing your acceptance speech
for the video sleaze awards?

1087
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:50,400
- Try Pulitzer.
- (PA) Ladies and gentlemen,...

1088
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,520
..while waiting to land, we are
turning on local Washington TV.

1089
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,440
The sound is on channel three.

1090
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:03,720
OK.

1091
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:05,080
OK, OK.

1092
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:15,480
Please, sir, we may land at any moment.

1093
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:18,320
- If you'll take your seat...
- I'm going to be sick.

1094
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,600
- I'm going to be sick.
- Sir, the seat belt light is on.

1095
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:26,760
Moron.

1096
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:28,840
- WZDC.
- This is Richard Thornberg.

1097
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,640
Put me through to Ruben
in the newsroom.

1098
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:34,240
- He's about to go live.
- I know he is. That's why I need him.

1099
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,640
You'll have to hold on...

1100
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,600
Put me through, Celia,
or start typing your resume.

1101
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:41,200
Esperanza's down,...

1102
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:43,280
..but he's hurt.

1103
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:45,360
He took a round in his shoulder.

1104
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:48,760
l got one more of their guys.
That's six they lost altogether.

1105
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:51,680
lf we knew how many they had
to start with, we could get excited,...

1106
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,320
..but if they got 50 guys,
it's a little early to open the champagne!

1107
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:59,000
We appreciate your effort, but we
don't need a loose cannon here!

1108
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:02,520
What if they crash another plane
in retaliation for your stunt?

1109
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:04,280
They can't do that now, right, Barnes?

1110
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,480
Besides, if I grabbed Esperanza,
this would be over now.

1111
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:10,120
Maybe they're more creative
than you think!

1112
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:12,360
Well, at least I'm thinking, god dammit!

1113
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:16,040
We're here to jerk off that cocksucker
until he tries to take off.

1114
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:17,120
Period!

1115
01:18:17,240 --> 01:18:20,080
You're the wrong guy
in the wrong place at the wrong time!

1116
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:23,840
The story of my life.

1117
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:28,080
Major! Pentagon Situation Room, sir!

1118
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:31,360
Pentagon. I'll take it in here.
Thank you, Telford.

1119
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,120
You men come with me.

1120
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,600
- McClane.
- Yeah, Barnes.

1121
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:40,120
You said those guys
showed up right away?

1122
01:18:40,200 --> 01:18:43,120
- Yeah.
- That means they're on the field or close.

1123
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:45,720
And I think I know where.

1124
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,520
Let me show you something.

1125
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:52,440
These are the old plans
with the longer runways.

1126
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,640
That's 12 years ago.

1127
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:56,280
Looks like they've modified the site,...

1128
01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:59,640
..moved Tra-Con phones, ILS,
all the underground stuff...

1129
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:01,520
..so they could handle drainage.

1130
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:02,800
lf I'm right,...

1131
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,400
..it would run along the airport property...

1132
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:07,600
..and go right past this neighbourhood.

1133
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,080
We should have landed two hours ago!

1134
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,600
l understand, but if you just relax...

1135
01:19:15,680 --> 01:19:16,720
It's hopeless.

1136
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:21,440
Somebody ought to get their ass
kicked for this mess.

1137
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:25,520
Unfortunately, there isn't anyone
we can blame for the weather.

1138
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,440
Oh, yeah?
What about that porker, Willard Scott?

1139
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:30,320
l should have taken the bus.

1140
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:33,240
At least they can pull over
for food and gas.

1141
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,240
Excuse me.

1142
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,080
Yes?

1143
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,720
l was just wondering.

1144
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:42,200
This flight originally was
supposed to be 5½ hours, right?

1145
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,080
Mm-hmm.

1146
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:45,720
Do we have enough fuel
to keep circling like this?

1147
01:19:45,800 --> 01:19:46,800
Oh, of course.

1148
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,840
They anticipate little problems like this.

1149
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:09,160
We looked at 12 fucking houses,
and we're nowhere.

1150
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:11,960
This is our last possibility.

1151
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,040
Over here there's an old church.

1152
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:15,800
Let's go.

1153
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,920
Wait.

1154
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,520
There's the church over there.

1155
01:20:37,640 --> 01:20:39,440
Could be a sentry.

1156
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,120
He could just be out for a walk.

1157
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:43,600
Then why is he
going over his own footsteps?

1158
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:47,240
Come on.

1159
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:50,520
All right.

1160
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:53,000
Stay here
and get ready to call the marines.

1161
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,680
l thought they were the army.

1162
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,680
Who gives a fuck? Just be ready.

1163
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:14,880
- (beeping)
- Oh, shit.

1164
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,040
(Not now.)

1165
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:32,120
Lorenzo, it's Barnes.

1166
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:34,720
Where the hell did you go?
Where's McClane?

1167
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,960
With me, at the Hidey Lake Church,
to the west of the airport.

1168
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:41,120
Where? God dammit!
You crazy idiot, why didn't...

1169
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,880
This must be their operations base.

1170
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,600
Shut up and get your ass here!

1171
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:46,680
Code red! Sitrep.

1172
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:49,080
We got positive ID on Stuart's location.

1173
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:50,720
- Let's move.
- Yo!

1174
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:04,000
Our escape plane will be ready
within 30 minutes, General.

1175
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,200
lf there are no more surprises.

1176
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,480
(sirens)

1177
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:24,720
Gentlemen, we have a situation here.

1178
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:13,240
Aagh!

1179
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,040
Ugh!

1180
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:39,560
(whistles)

1181
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:40,840
Over here.

1182
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:55,320
Jeez, McClane, you all right?
You want a medic?

1183
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:58,440
What the hell you think you're doing,
playing John Wayne?

1184
01:23:58,520 --> 01:24:00,680
How would you like to spend
the night in a cell?

1185
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,880
Lorenzo, shut the fuck up
and do something useful.

1186
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,120
Go seal off the street.

1187
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,200
Hey, you can't talk to me like that.

1188
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:07,560
Oh, no, Carmine?

1189
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:11,200
Sergeant, get this bureaucrat
out of Mr McClane's face now.

1190
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,120
With pleasure, sir.

1191
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:18,640
Major, the men are in position, sir.

1192
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:20,520
Close up the back. Then we go in.

1193
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:22,920
- Fire only on my order.
- Roger that, sir.

1194
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,720
Guess I was wrong about you.

1195
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,200
You're not such an asshole after all.

1196
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:30,720
No, you were right.
l'm just your kind of asshole.

1197
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,480
(beeping)

1198
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:41,320
Garber, sitrep!

1199
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:45,120
Army Special Forces on three sides,
closing in fast around the back!

1200
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,800
- Another problem, Colonel?
- No problem, General.

1201
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:51,560
Gentlemen, you know what to do.

1202
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,040
- Down!
- Get down! Get down!

1203
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,040
(beeping)

1204
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:27,720
(beeping)

1205
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,000
General,...

1206
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:33,880
..it's time.

1207
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,000
(power cuts off)

1208
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:38,560
(beeping)

1209
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,360
Come on, let's move it!

1210
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:59,720
- They're pulling out... at the back!
- What?

1211
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,840
(gunfire)

1212
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:08,200
Move it!

1213
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:20,720
Albertson, take your men around the back.

1214
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:29,040
Aagh!

1215
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:35,120
Aagh!

1216
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,640
This equipment could land our planes.

1217
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,320
There are trip wires.
They could have booby-trapped...

1218
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,280
- They did.
- Got one here, too.

1219
01:26:52,360 --> 01:26:54,600
Looks like C-4.
The motherfucker is armed.

1220
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,600
Clear the area! Everybody, now!

1221
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:01,560
They booby-trapped all the equipment.

1222
01:27:01,640 --> 01:27:03,000
Seal off the building!

1223
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,440
Shit!

1224
01:27:04,520 --> 01:27:06,960
Post sentries. No civilians allowed.

1225
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:09,720
Hey, where the fuck is McClane?

1226
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,040
Miller, take him!

1227
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:01,360
l'll cover you!

1228
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:39,720
Aagh!

1229
01:28:46,280 --> 01:28:48,520
So much for the element of chance.

1230
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,920
Let's move out.

1231
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:11,840
l had the bastard in my sights.
I know I did.

1232
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:22,680
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1233
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:29,920
(Stuart)
Attention. Attention, Dulles tower.

1234
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,760
This is Colonel Stuart.
Is our plane prepared?

1235
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:36,760
lt is. It's in hangar 11.
It's the most remote building we've got.

1236
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:39,720
We're on our way.

1237
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:43,320
Have a ground crew there
to confirm the condition of the plane.

1238
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:46,000
Do you believe the balls
on this son of a bitch?

1239
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:49,760
Colonel, you're quite capable
of confirming it yourself.

1240
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:52,920
Don't ask us to gift-wrap
potential hostages for you.

1241
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:54,360
Major Grant, isn't it?

1242
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:55,880
lf you remember me, Colonel,...

1243
01:29:55,960 --> 01:29:58,360
..then you remember
I know the drillas well as you do.

1244
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,400
Check out your own fucking plane.

1245
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:05,400
We move out in five minutes.
Flak jackets for everybody.

1246
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:09,240
Body armour for the assault team.
Night scopes for the snipers.

1247
01:30:09,320 --> 01:30:13,120
We will take them in the hangar,
and I will pull that detonator...

1248
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,040
..out of Stuart's dead fucking hand myself.

1249
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:19,120
Lorenzo, take all your men
back to the airport.

1250
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:20,720
Seal off every exit,...

1251
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,960
..in case they try to slip past us
to break out onto the ground.

1252
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:25,480
You got it.

1253
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,080
All right, here we go.

1254
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:33,120
This is nuts!
Every station has people at the airport,...

1255
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,200
..and no-one has heard
a whisper of this shit!

1256
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,320
None of them is me.

1257
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,240
You want proof, try this.

1258
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:41,360
(Barnes) Repeat.
Terrorists have murdered civilians...

1259
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:44,360
..and cut off the two systems
that can allow you to land.

1260
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:48,000
A Special US Army unit is here,
preparing to take out the terrorists.

1261
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,800
- Jesus Christ.
- I want you to go live now.

1262
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,760
Get me in from the files.
A publicity shot.

1263
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:54,800
The maps, steal one from weather.

1264
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:56,880
We're on it.
We're cutting in five minutes!

1265
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,640
Tell the affiliates if they want in,
they got three minutes to shout.

1266
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:01,320
Let's do this.

1267
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,840
Network, here I come.

1268
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:09,480
Telford,
what was your chicken-shit outfit doing...

1269
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:11,120
..while we were taking Grenada?

1270
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:14,240
Grenada.

1271
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:17,840
Five minutes of fire fight,
five weeks of surfing.

1272
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:19,960
l wish I was with you guys for that.

1273
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,280
Yeah. Me, too, kid.

1274
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:25,120
- Really, sir?
- Sure.

1275
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:27,760
Then we wouldn't have to do this.

1276
01:31:40,320 --> 01:31:42,400
(beeping)

1277
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:45,240
Eagle Nest, this is Hatchling.

1278
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:48,920
On schedule... and in position.

1279
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,200
Roger, Hatchling. We are secure here.

1280
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:53,200
You have a green light.

1281
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,760
l repeat, a green light.

1282
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,280
(whistles)

1283
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,000
Ugh!

1284
01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:09,440
Jesus, officer,
where did you come from,...

1285
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:10,880
..Pearl Harbour?

1286
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:18,160
All right, let's clear it out, please.

1287
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:20,280
Stand by.

1288
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,480
Five, four, three...

1289
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:27,040
(TV) This is a special bulletin
from WZDC News.

1290
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,560
There has been a plane crash at Dulles,
where other aircraft still circle,...

1291
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:33,800
..with no explanation
from airport or FAA officials.

1292
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:36,440
And now,
with an exclusive WZDC report,...

1293
01:32:36,520 --> 01:32:40,160
..here's Dick Thornberg reporting
from the skies over Washington.

1294
01:32:40,240 --> 01:32:44,560
(Thornberg) I'm one of the thousand people
who has been circling our capital...

1295
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:49,120
..under the assumption that whatever
problem there was below was a normal one.

1296
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,240
But the truth is far from normal.

1297
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:53,280
The truth is terrifying.

1298
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:56,440
Look out! Lady, look out!

1299
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:57,360
Look out! Look out!

1300
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,720
Look out! Look out!
Get out of the way!

1301
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:03,800
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way, lady!

1302
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:05,520
Go, go! Hey, hey, look out!

1303
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:07,640
This is a recording of a conversation...

1304
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:10,600
..between Dulles tower
and a captive aircraft overhead.

1305
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,720
Get out of the way!

1306
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,520
Lorenzo!

1307
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,560
- Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Where's the Blue Light team?

1308
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:23,600
- Stuart's rigged explosives to a remote.
- Where's Grant?

1309
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:26,240
They're going to kill that son of a bitch
and get it from them!

1310
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:28,480
No, they're going to take off
on that plane with him!

1311
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,600
Get the fuck out of here!

1312
01:33:30,680 --> 01:33:33,080
When the army canned Stuart,
he loaded that unit with his men!

1313
01:33:33,160 --> 01:33:36,960
- Are you nuts? That fire fight...
- Sideshow to buy him some time.

1314
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:40,120
McClane, you are completely
around the fucking bend.

1315
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:41,640
You're under arrest, motherfucker.

1316
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:50,520
These are the bullets
they used out there tonight!

1317
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:52,320
Blanks!

1318
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:56,640
Jesus Christ.

1319
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:05,680
This is Chief Lorenzo.

1320
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:09,160
l want every officer recalled
and in body armour and full weaponry...

1321
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:11,080
..in the motor pool in five minutes.

1322
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,880
It's time to kick ass.

1323
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,840
Just like Iwo Jima!

1324
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:25,000
(Thornberg) We have learned that
the terrorists have control of the airport,...

1325
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:28,040
..a fact that the authorities have repressed.

1326
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:32,160
The terrorists promise more bloodshed
unless their demands are met.

1327
01:34:32,240 --> 01:34:36,280
Now that the Special army commandos
have arrived at the airport,...

1328
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:40,120
..the likelihood of a full-scale battle
is dangerously close.

1329
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,720
That stupid, arrogant son of a bitch.

1330
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,320
It's all over the airport.

1331
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:07,440
(TV) 300 people have died...

1332
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:09,840
When are we going to land?

1333
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:12,320
..and unfortunately,
they may not be the last.

1334
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:15,640
The horrifying fact is that no-one is safe,...

1335
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:19,520
..either in the planes above Dulles
or in the terminal below.

1336
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,880
The threat of a new and higher
body countat the airport...

1337
01:35:22,960 --> 01:35:25,160
..hangs over the heads of everyone,...

1338
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:29,000
..and the holiday season
of peace and love has become a nightmare.

1339
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,240
All right, listen up!

1340
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:39,240
All units,
I want you to converge on hangar 11,...

1341
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:40,640
..all sides!

1342
01:35:40,720 --> 01:35:42,560
This car, McClane! Get in!

1343
01:35:42,640 --> 01:35:45,080
When the city blue show up
with their backup,...

1344
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:46,880
..they'll pick up the pieces!

1345
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:48,520
Now, move out!

1346
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:51,480
McClane, say hi to my brother Vito.

1347
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:53,960
Merry Christmas.

1348
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:55,840
Hi.

1349
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:05,600
God dammit to hell!
Move that piece of shit!

1350
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:08,600
Will you move
that goddamn piece of shit...

1351
01:36:08,680 --> 01:36:09,920
..out of here?

1352
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,080
Vito, get the fuck out of the car!

1353
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:14,240
Get your ass in gear and help me!

1354
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,280
Will you get... ?

1355
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:17,720
Move that car right now!

1356
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:18,920
Right there. Get that.

1357
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:20,960
Hey, Coleman!

1358
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:24,280
Sam! Sam Coleman!

1359
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:27,160
Hey, Coleman!

1360
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:28,520
Hi!

1361
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:29,960
Coleman!

1362
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:34,360
..but at least the truth
is not among the hostages...

1363
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:37,920
..because l, Richard Thornberg,
just happened to be here...

1364
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:44,920
..to put his life and talent
on the line for humanity and country.

1365
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,960
lf this should be my final broadcast...

1366
01:36:50,040 --> 01:36:52,920
Amen to that,... Dick.

1367
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:55,840
(reporter) Dick? We're live, Dick.

1368
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,800
Where are you now?

1369
01:36:57,880 --> 01:36:59,240
Dick?

1370
01:37:01,120 --> 01:37:02,840
Truck lights approaching, sir.

1371
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:05,320
They're here, right on schedule.

1372
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,720
The hangar door, open it.

1373
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,160
Clockwork.

1374
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:35,120
Jeez, you give me this story,
and I'll have your baby.

1375
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:37,920
Not the kind of ride I'm looking for.

1376
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:52,320
Colonel, if I may say so,
you are some piece of work.

1377
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:55,320
Thank you, Major.
You're not so bad yourself.

1378
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,400
Congratulations on your escape, sir.

1379
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:00,880
Thank you, Major.
Save them until we are all safe, hmm?

1380
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:02,360
Sir.

1381
01:38:02,440 --> 01:38:04,320
My congratulations, gentlemen.

1382
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,840
You've won a victory for our way of life,...

1383
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:09,920
..my pride, my admiration,
and a kick-ass vacation.

1384
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,680
Now, get on board.

1385
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:41,760
What's the matter, cowboy?
Ride too rough?

1386
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:44,120
- I don't like to fly.
- Then why are you here?

1387
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:45,720
l don't like to lose, either.

1388
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:48,480
OK, whoa! Here we go!

1389
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,640
l don't know about you guys,...

1390
01:38:57,720 --> 01:39:00,680
..but I've seen enough
fucking snow to last me a lifetime.

1391
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,720
You don't get much of that in the tropics.

1392
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,480
For you gentlemen, we'll import it.

1393
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:09,920
Shit! They left the hangar!

1394
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,800
Right there. Right there. Get that.

1395
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:18,040
- Now what?
- Get in front! Take it down!

1396
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,120
Block their path so they can't get out!

1397
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:21,640
l'm not playing chicken
with a 200-ton plane!

1398
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:24,080
l'm crazy, but I ain't that crazy.
Forget it.

1399
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:25,680
(radio) Dulles, this is Northeast 140.

1400
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:28,000
- Request clearance to land.
- That's Holly's plane.

1401
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,640
Repeat. Request emergency clearance.

1402
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,800
l know you won't answer,
but you better listen!

1403
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:35,000
We're down to fumes,
and we have to land.

1404
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:37,080
ln five minutes, we're coming in.

1405
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:40,160
That's my wife's plane!
Take it fucking down!

1406
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:42,800
l'm not getting in front of that plane!

1407
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,840
All right, how about getting over top of it?

1408
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:50,400
(PA) This is the captain.

1409
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:51,520
Your attention.

1410
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:54,800
We have no choice
but to attempt an emergency landing.

1411
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:57,200
Fasten your seatbelts
and assume crash positions...

1412
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,600
..as instructed by your cabin attendants.

1413
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:01,840
Let's have the emergency check list.

1414
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:04,440
Attention, all air traffic in Dulles area.

1415
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:05,920
This is Northeast 140.

1416
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,840
We are attempting an emergency landing.
Be advised.

1417
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:12,520
l don't want to die.

1418
01:40:12,840 --> 01:40:14,720
l don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

1419
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,520
Just buckle your seat belt.

1420
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:18,040
l'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1421
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:19,360
Lean forward.

1422
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,480
(Thornberg) God!

1423
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,680
(whimpers)

1424
01:40:27,200 --> 01:40:28,760
Oh, God.

1425
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:30,520
Oh, God,...

1426
01:40:30,600 --> 01:40:34,320
Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.

1427
01:40:40,200 --> 01:40:41,640
Just hang on!

1428
01:40:41,720 --> 01:40:43,520
What are you doing?

1429
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:44,640
You wanted a story.

1430
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:46,760
Nice and easy, boys.
Get me in low!

1431
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:48,480
You got it!

1432
01:40:50,720 --> 01:40:52,720
Bring me down!

1433
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:56,120
(Coleman) You'll get yourself killed!
Come back inside!

1434
01:41:02,040 --> 01:41:04,200
Bring it in low! Keep over the wing!

1435
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,640
Lower!

1436
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:14,600
Aagh!

1437
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:26,760
John, what the fuck are you doing
out on the wing of this plane?

1438
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,440
Damn!

1439
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:41,320
Mierda.

1440
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:42,800
There's something wrong.

1441
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:45,400
The ailerons.

1442
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:46,560
We can't take off.

1443
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:53,160
Hijo de puta. It's McClane again.

1444
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:56,040
Son of a bitch!

1445
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:00,760
- I'll do him.
- This time do it right.

1446
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,880
You just get us in the air, General.

1447
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:04,480
Only you can do it.

1448
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,440
Don't shoot.
That wing is fully fuelled.

1449
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:59,560
Too bad, McClane.
I kind of liked you!

1450
01:43:03,320 --> 01:43:04,360
Whoa!

1451
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:09,280
l got enough friends!

1452
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:13,160
Aagh!

1453
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:46,120
OK, McClane!

1454
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:47,400
Time for the main event!

1455
01:43:57,480 --> 01:43:58,480
(spits)

1456
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,040
Motherfucker!

1457
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:32,480
Agh!

1458
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:35,120
(laughs)

1459
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:36,320
How's it going?

1460
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,480
Bon voyage!

1461
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,680
Happy landings, asshole!

1462
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:41,280
Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.

1463
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:55,200
Yeah. All right.

1464
01:46:08,920 --> 01:46:10,400
Aagh!

1465
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:15,200
Whoa!

1466
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:24,880
(laughs)

1467
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:27,360
Aaah!

1468
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:33,400
Holly!

1469
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:36,440
Here's your fucking landing light!

1470
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:37,640
Whoa!

1471
01:46:43,320 --> 01:46:44,720
Oh, God.

1472
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:46,960
(prays)

1473
01:46:47,040 --> 01:46:48,480
Look!

1474
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:51,040
Look! OK, I see it! I see it!

1475
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:17,480
They used the fucking fire to see!

1476
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,680
They can all do that. Let's tell them.

1477
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:21,760
They already know.

1478
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:23,680
(radio) We had a visual on the landing.

1479
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,080
- Listen.
- We're following the fire trail in...

1480
01:47:26,160 --> 01:47:27,520
lf they can do it, so can we!

1481
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,280
Whoa!

1482
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:48,160
Any landing you can walk away from
is a good one.

1483
01:47:48,240 --> 01:47:49,880
Phew!

1484
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:13,440
Uh!

1485
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:17,800
Jump!

1486
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:21,360
- Jump!
- I got you!

1487
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:22,520
Jump!

1488
01:48:22,600 --> 01:48:25,280
(sirens)

1489
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:34,840
(cheering)

1490
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:51,720
There you go. That's it.

1491
01:48:52,920 --> 01:48:54,200
There he is!

1492
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,560
That's it!

1493
01:48:56,920 --> 01:49:00,280
Holly!

1494
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:06,360
Holly!

1495
01:49:07,040 --> 01:49:08,600
Holly!

1496
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:13,200
Holly!

1497
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,800
Holly!

1498
01:49:20,920 --> 01:49:23,760
Holly!

1499
01:49:27,640 --> 01:49:29,840
Holly!

1500
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:35,120
Holly!

1501
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:40,840
Come on! We got you!

1502
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:47,720
Oh, God. Oh, baby.

1503
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:50,160
l thought I was never
going to see you again.

1504
01:49:50,240 --> 01:49:52,360
That's what I thought about you.

1505
01:49:52,440 --> 01:49:54,240
l love you so much.

1506
01:49:57,560 --> 01:50:00,360
They told me
there were terrorists at the airport.

1507
01:50:00,440 --> 01:50:03,760
Yeah. I heard that, too.

1508
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,680
God, that's beautiful.

1509
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:14,680
Yeah.

1510
01:50:15,640 --> 01:50:19,200
Yup, it sure is.

1511
01:50:19,280 --> 01:50:21,440
Oh, I love you so much.

1512
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:25,400
Oh, John.

1513
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:28,720
Why does this keep happening to us?

1514
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:36,400
Let's go home.

1515
01:50:37,120 --> 01:50:38,600
Get in the truck!

1516
01:50:38,720 --> 01:50:40,560
Let's get her out of here!

1517
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:42,960
Somebody help me, please!

1518
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:44,880
Oh, honey, help me up here, please.

1519
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:46,560
Asshole!

1520
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,040
Hey, officer! Hey, come on!

1521
01:50:52,120 --> 01:50:53,480
Hey, hey!

1522
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:56,440
Hop on in here! Get your missus in!

1523
01:50:56,520 --> 01:50:58,080
What do you say, Marv?

1524
01:50:58,160 --> 01:51:01,800
l'll be damned if I'm going
to clean up this mess!

1525
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:03,720
(laughs)

1526
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:05,760
(siren)

1527
01:51:08,920 --> 01:51:09,920
Hey, McClane!

1528
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:14,840
You get this parking ticket
in front of my airport?

1529
01:51:16,080 --> 01:51:17,720
Yeah.

1530
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:21,480
Ah, what the hell. It's Christmas!

1531
01:51:24,320 --> 01:51:26,320
# Oh, the weather outside is frightful

1532
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:27,400
Take off, Marv!

1533
01:51:27,480 --> 01:51:31,280
# But the fire is so delightful

1534
01:51:31,360 --> 01:51:35,400
# And since we've no place to go

1535
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:39,240
# Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

1536
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:42,680
# lt doesn't show signs of stopping

1537
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:46,400
# And I brought some corn for popping

1538
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:49,880
# The lights are turned way down low

1539
01:51:49,960 --> 01:51:53,480
# Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

1540
01:51:53,560 --> 01:51:57,160
# When we finally kiss goodnight

1541
01:51:57,240 --> 01:52:00,840
# How I hate going out in the storm

1542
01:52:00,920 --> 01:52:04,880
# But if you'll really hold me tight

1543
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:08,400
# All the way home I'll be warm

1544
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:11,760
# The fire is slowly dying

1545
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:15,360
# And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing

1546
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:18,960
# But as long as you love me so

1547
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:22,480
# Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

1548
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:26,160
# When we finally kiss goodnight

1549
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:29,760
# How I hate going out in the storm

1550
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:33,800
# But if you'll really hold me tight

1551
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:37,560
# All the way home I'll be warm

1552
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:40,680
