1
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,268
I am a prosecutor.

2
00:00:20,144 --> 00:00:23,065
I'm a part of the business of accusing...

3
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,275
...judging...

4
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,235
...and punishing.

5
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,991
I explore the evidence of a crime...

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,286
...and determine who is charged...

7
00:00:35,496 --> 00:00:37,541
...who is brought to this room...

8
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:39,835
...to be tried before his peers.

9
00:00:42,004 --> 00:00:44,508
I present my evidence to the jury...

10
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:47,636
...and they deliberate upon it.

11
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,348
They must determine
what really happened.

12
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:55,478
If they cannot...

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,985
...we won't know if the accused deserves
to be freed or to be punished.

14
00:01:02,612 --> 00:01:04,823
If they cannot find the truth...

15
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:07,993
...what is our hope of justice?

16
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:44,859
Where's Nat?

17
00:02:45,486 --> 00:02:47,279
Burying a goldfish.

18
00:02:47,905 --> 00:02:51,659
That he forgot to feed.
Kid's gotta learn responsibility.

19
00:02:52,076 --> 00:02:53,453
He's nine.

20
00:02:53,703 --> 00:02:56,665
When you were nine,
you fed the animals on the block...

21
00:02:56,748 --> 00:02:58,959
...and made dinner,
did everyone's homework...

22
00:02:59,042 --> 00:03:01,546
...and, in your spare time,
you practiced law.

23
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:04,383
I didn't practice law until I was ten.

24
00:03:05,134 --> 00:03:06,552
Listen to this.

25
00:03:06,802 --> 00:03:10,474
"In their first face-to-face debate,
Nico Della Guardia...

26
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,310
"...appeared to throw
Raymond Horgan off stride...

27
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:16,356
"...with an opening swipe
at the prosecuting attorney's...

28
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,527
"...twelve-year tenure as
'an uninterrupted retreat from reality...

29
00:03:20,944 --> 00:03:25,741
"'... and slow-motion surrender to thugs,
punks and hand-wringing liberals."'

30
00:03:26,117 --> 00:03:27,953
The guy's unbelievable.

31
00:03:28,454 --> 00:03:32,625
I'm finally starting to get used to that rug
on Della Guardia's head.

32
00:03:33,293 --> 00:03:35,378
Don't eat standing up. Sit down.

33
00:03:35,462 --> 00:03:38,632
Food goes down easier.
It has the help of gravity.

34
00:03:38,883 --> 00:03:40,176
Oh, God.

35
00:03:41,302 --> 00:03:43,095
Yet another lawyer.

36
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:54,319
I won't be home till late.
I got a game after school.

37
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,908
Like his father, he doesn't come home
till he has to.

38
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:03,162
If Raymond loses this election,
I could be home a lot.

39
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:47,882
Rick, I looked this over last night.

40
00:04:48,675 --> 00:04:50,051
Top count, max.

41
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:51,803
It's a first offense!

42
00:04:52,053 --> 00:04:54,640
No plea to anything
but the A-1 felony. Period.

43
00:04:54,723 --> 00:04:56,016
On all of them?

44
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:57,309
All of them.

45
00:04:57,393 --> 00:04:59,812
And no promises on the sentence.

46
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,569
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

47
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:08,657
This is for you.

48
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,245
Someone put it under the door last night.

49
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:14,247
I found it when I came in.

50
00:05:18,294 --> 00:05:20,671
Mr. Big Cheese wants to see you now.

51
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:22,089
I'll be right along.

52
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:23,966
He said "now," now.

53
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:48,955
What's wrong?

54
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:52,626
Carolyn Polhemus was murdered last night.

55
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,130
Her cleaning lady found the body
this morning.

56
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:59,051
Some creep got into her place
and strangled her.

57
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:02,262
It looks like she was raped.
He tied her up...

58
00:06:02,931 --> 00:06:06,392
...he beat her with some instrument
and strangled her.

59
00:06:06,643 --> 00:06:09,270
No weapon. No sign of forced entry.

60
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:13,567
Unless you want me here,
I'm supposed to meet the coroner.

61
00:06:13,651 --> 00:06:16,278
That's all right. Go on, get out of here.

62
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:18,866
I can hear Della Guardia now.

63
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:23,496
"If Raymond Horgan can't protect his own
attorneys, how can he protect citizens?"

64
00:06:24,331 --> 00:06:27,502
Tommy Molto's secretary said
he wasn't coming in today.

65
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:32,465
Some fucking Acting Head of Homicide
he turned out to be, the little creep.

66
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:35,553
I should have fired him when we fired Nico.

67
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:38,180
If I had balls, I'd do it now.

68
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:41,935
I want you to handle this case personally.

69
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:44,020
I will assign it to somebody.

70
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:46,148
Who will you assign it to? Homicide?

71
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:48,401
Tommy Molto? For Christ's sake!

72
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,115
Della Guardia would love that.
Molto would tip him off on everything.

73
00:06:53,198 --> 00:06:57,872
They're so close you can see Molto's nose
sticking out of Nico's bellybutton.

74
00:07:02,418 --> 00:07:03,753
Listen to me.

75
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:07,591
What a waste.

76
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,554
Beautiful, sexy gal. Hell of a lawyer.

77
00:07:13,806 --> 00:07:16,393
That's her ending. That's her au revoir.

78
00:07:17,561 --> 00:07:19,522
The first thing we got to think about...

79
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:23,026
...is what the public thinks
in the middle of an election.

80
00:07:27,865 --> 00:07:30,493
Take charge of this one for me, okay?

81
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,247
If you care about my health.

82
00:07:34,582 --> 00:07:37,084
You're the only around here I can trust.

83
00:07:38,753 --> 00:07:43,301
Greer's a good investigator, but I'd prefer
someone I'm used to working with.

84
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:44,886
Lipranzer.

85
00:07:45,053 --> 00:07:46,513
Whatever you want.

86
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,600
Just catch me a bad guy.

87
00:09:06,484 --> 00:09:07,985
So, I'm here.

88
00:09:10,821 --> 00:09:13,450
What the hell was she doing with a B file?

89
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,537
Bribery of elected officials.
The case number is on her computer.

90
00:09:17,621 --> 00:09:20,834
But the case itself isn't among
the papers in her files.

91
00:09:21,001 --> 00:09:22,920
Why? Did she take it home? What?

92
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:24,546
Maybe it was taken?

93
00:09:24,713 --> 00:09:26,632
Check the apartment.
What do you got here?

94
00:09:26,715 --> 00:09:28,761
Bunch of pictures of a dead lady.

95
00:09:28,844 --> 00:09:30,763
- No weapon found, yet?
- Nada.

96
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,348
It's a weird one.

97
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:35,393
She was strangled by the ropes
but by the way he tied her...

98
00:09:35,477 --> 00:09:38,313
...it's like he put himself
between her legs and pumped...

99
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:42,944
...so they tightened up like he was trying
to let his weight strangle her.

100
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:45,363
Like he was trying to fuck her to death.

101
00:09:45,446 --> 00:09:47,032
Look at the next one.

102
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:58,420
Check the computer for sex offenders
and cross match on Carolyn's name...

103
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:01,131
...or this business with the ropes.

104
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:06,305
Find out which of the creeps she put away
is out on parole.

105
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:11,061
I never did understand why you put her
in charge of rape and all that sicko shit.

106
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:14,566
She wanted it. And she was good.

107
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:17,068
Yeah, too good, maybe.

108
00:10:18,236 --> 00:10:20,072
I'm not grabbing this, yet.

109
00:10:21,574 --> 00:10:22,783
You worked with this broad.

110
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:26,537
She wouldn't leave her fucking door
and windows wide open.

111
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,834
She was drinking with him. She gave him
a glass of beer, like she was entertaining.

112
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,836
- Fingerprints on the glass?
- Yeah.

113
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,838
Greer sent it down to the lab.

114
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:39,428
You mean somebody she let in opened
the windows so it looked like a break-in?

115
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:43,767
She wasn't going to let some sex maniac
she sent to jail in for a beer.

116
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,355
On the other hand, we're talking Carolyn.

117
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,567
Mac...

118
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,613
...tell me what Carolyn Polhemus
was doing with a bribery file.

119
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,743
I had no idea Carolyn was interested
in crimes above the waist.

120
00:10:58,826 --> 00:11:02,456
It's on her computer,
but not on mine or the department's.

121
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:04,208
That makes no sense.

122
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,503
Why don't you ask Raymond?

123
00:11:07,253 --> 00:11:09,005
Ready for something else?

124
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:11,883
Molto's left.

125
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:16,138
His secretary came back from lunch
and found his desk cleaned out.

126
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:10,620
Exercise?

127
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,583
Masturbation.

128
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,128
The refuge of the lonely housewife.

129
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:22,343
Missed the 8:35. I tried to call,
but you weren't here.

130
00:12:22,427 --> 00:12:25,638
Nat had dinner at Josh's,
and I was at the university.

131
00:12:25,763 --> 00:12:28,976
I tried to get in a little extra time
on the mainframe.

132
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,478
Get anything done?

133
00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:35,065
Who am I kidding?

134
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:38,321
Still working on my dissertation at my age.
It's ridiculous.

135
00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:41,073
You were the best mathematician
in your class.

136
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:44,579
Second best just made
full professor at MIT.

137
00:12:45,872 --> 00:12:47,165
All I've made are beds.

138
00:12:47,248 --> 00:12:49,375
And now, the Channel Six local news.

139
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:54,298
Carolyn Polhemus, assistant prosecuting
attorney in Raymond Horgan's office...

140
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:57,468
...was found brutally murdered
in her Southside apartment.

141
00:12:57,551 --> 00:13:01,514
Police are about to release a statement
about the circumstances of her death...

142
00:13:01,598 --> 00:13:02,724
You hear?

143
00:13:02,807 --> 00:13:06,269
Eugenia was thrilled to be messenger
of bad tidings.

144
00:13:08,482 --> 00:13:09,942
Yeah, I'll bet.

145
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:14,490
From top to bottom
we are riddled with cruelty.

146
00:13:14,698 --> 00:13:16,992
We must expose and punish it...

147
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,247
...especially when inflicted
upon the impotent and the ignored.

148
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,544
You sound like a woman with a mission.

149
00:13:26,294 --> 00:13:27,337
I am.

150
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,633
The murder of Ms. Polhemus...

151
00:13:32,802 --> 00:13:34,304
You have a suspect?

152
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:36,473
We have diddly-shit.

153
00:13:41,312 --> 00:13:45,693
So Dan Lipranzer and Rusty Sabich
will work night and day for two weeks...

154
00:13:45,818 --> 00:13:48,737
...to catch Raymond a killer.
That's the strategy.

155
00:13:49,738 --> 00:13:52,159
You're in charge of this investigation?

156
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:55,705
Raymond insisted I take it on.

157
00:13:57,707 --> 00:14:02,338
With 150 lawyers, they couldn't find one
who didn't fuck her to put in charge?

158
00:14:05,675 --> 00:14:07,219
Did you tell Raymond?

159
00:14:07,845 --> 00:14:10,931
This is a conflict of interest.
Is that professional?

160
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:16,021
Barbara, I'm Raymond's chief deputy.

161
00:14:16,354 --> 00:14:18,356
You are so predictable.

162
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,029
It's your way of reliving the whole thing.

163
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,033
She's dead and you're still obsessing.

164
00:14:37,714 --> 00:14:38,715
Rusty.

165
00:14:39,716 --> 00:14:40,759
Nico.

166
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:42,969
She was just...

167
00:14:44,054 --> 00:14:46,557
- Splendid.
- That's it. Very good.

168
00:14:47,475 --> 00:14:50,312
Raymond's pressing hard
on that case, I imagine.

169
00:14:50,979 --> 00:14:53,566
Raymond presses hard on every case, Nico.

170
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:56,945
You know who would've been hard
to beat? You.

171
00:14:57,904 --> 00:15:00,241
You would've been tough. Very tough.

172
00:15:00,783 --> 00:15:03,911
You are really something.
Where's Tommy Molto?

173
00:15:04,578 --> 00:15:05,412
Molto?

174
00:15:05,496 --> 00:15:08,542
I thought he'd come to the funeral
of his favorite colleague.

175
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:10,878
You must really have him scrambling.

176
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:17,262
Judge.

177
00:15:22,892 --> 00:15:24,562
Who's that with Raymond?

178
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:27,022
I'm told that's her ex-husband.

179
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:31,194
I didn't know she had one.

180
00:15:33,572 --> 00:15:35,407
Teaches college someplace.

181
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,867
Carolyn Polhemus worked for me.

182
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:40,414
I hired her...

183
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:42,666
...over the objections of...

184
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:47,006
...many of our prosecutors
who felt she just didn't have the stuff.

185
00:15:48,257 --> 00:15:50,718
I see those prosecutors here today...

186
00:15:52,386 --> 00:15:54,723
...along with the judges she defied...

187
00:15:55,891 --> 00:15:58,560
...and the defense attorneys she defeated.

188
00:16:00,897 --> 00:16:02,565
Why are they all here?

189
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,738
They're here because Carolyn Polhemus
stood for something.

190
00:16:09,407 --> 00:16:11,326
She stood for justice.

191
00:16:28,763 --> 00:16:30,974
The Prosecutor's Office,
under my leadership...

192
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:33,269
...has a conviction rate of over 91 percent.

193
00:16:33,353 --> 00:16:35,396
Mr. Della Guardia, or...

194
00:16:36,064 --> 00:16:40,110
...as he is known to those of us
who have had to work with him, "Delay"...

195
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:42,321
There's food here for 100 people.

196
00:16:42,404 --> 00:16:43,864
A lot of no-shows.

197
00:16:44,782 --> 00:16:46,284
They smell a loser.

198
00:16:47,535 --> 00:16:50,705
- Good speech.
- What the hell is happening with Carolyn?

199
00:16:51,456 --> 00:16:52,916
Everything's in the works.

200
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:56,755
I reassigned her cases, and this afternoon
I gotta deal with Molto's stuff.

201
00:16:56,838 --> 00:16:59,007
What's with this reassignment shit?

202
00:16:59,091 --> 00:17:00,592
Goddamn it, Rusty!

203
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:03,931
I told you to give this investigation
top priority.

204
00:17:05,182 --> 00:17:08,894
Nico is eating me alive with this thing.
The election is in ten days.

205
00:17:08,979 --> 00:17:11,815
If you don't find Carolyn's killer,
we are both history.

206
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:15,151
Turn all of that administrative bullshit
to Mac.

207
00:17:15,527 --> 00:17:17,530
Mac has more than she can handle.

208
00:17:17,613 --> 00:17:20,784
And let me remind you,
we lost two key PA's in one day.

209
00:17:20,993 --> 00:17:24,455
You only have time for the election.
I've got to run the office.

210
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:27,667
Fuck the office!
Don't you see what's happening?

211
00:17:27,792 --> 00:17:31,129
If you don't find me a killer,
there is no fucking office!

212
00:17:32,673 --> 00:17:35,342
I want you right on top
of Carolyn's case, understand?

213
00:17:35,426 --> 00:17:39,765
Run out every ground ball and do it
in an orderly goddamned fashion!

214
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:44,395
Start acting like a fucking professional!

215
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,983
The campaign is a total disaster.

216
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:51,154
Haven't taken a poll in two weeks.
We don't know where the hell we are.

217
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,407
You're ten minutes late
for the bar meeting on criminal procedure.

218
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:56,994
Call them and tell them I'm on my way.

219
00:18:02,167 --> 00:18:04,669
Did you assign a bribery case to Carolyn?

220
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:06,755
There's a file missing.

221
00:18:07,255 --> 00:18:10,676
Loretta, find my driver.
Tell him to be ready to leave.

222
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:13,847
She had a case on her computer
we can't account for.

223
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:16,350
It was logged in as a B file.

224
00:18:19,355 --> 00:18:21,690
Nobody knows where it came from.

225
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:25,195
Nobody knows where it went.

226
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:28,573
Where the hell is my speech?
It was right here on my desk.

227
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:30,033
Cody has it.

228
00:18:30,283 --> 00:18:32,285
You're giving me a runaround.

229
00:18:33,371 --> 00:18:36,541
Cody, pull the car around.
I'll meet you down in front.

230
00:18:37,376 --> 00:18:39,963
Give me a straight answer, will you, Boss?

231
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:54,061
There's the B file, Tiger.
Read it, and we'll talk.

232
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,484
"Dear Mr. Horgan.

233
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:02,572
"This is about a deputy prosecuting
attorney who is taking bribes.

234
00:19:02,699 --> 00:19:06,035
"Five years ago,
a person I'll call 'Noel' got arrested.

235
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,913
"I gave him $1,500 to pay somebody off.

236
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:13,919
"We went out to North Branch.
A secretary who seemed to know Noel...

237
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:18,925
"...took him into the PA's office, where
a man he could not see talked behind him.

238
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:23,597
"Ten days later, Noel went to court
and a lawyer from the PA's office...

239
00:19:23,722 --> 00:19:26,893
"...told the judge that
the case was dismissed.

240
00:19:27,185 --> 00:19:30,105
"I can't remember the lawyer's name.
I hope you get him.

241
00:19:30,188 --> 00:19:33,360
"I hope you get Noel, too.
He has let me down."

242
00:19:34,028 --> 00:19:35,863
- Unsigned.
- Unsigned.

243
00:19:36,947 --> 00:19:38,532
Five years ago.

244
00:19:38,824 --> 00:19:40,827
That guy must write real slow.

245
00:19:41,453 --> 00:19:43,246
"Noel equals Leon."

246
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:46,791
This is Carolyn's handwriting.

247
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,962
Looks like she went to North Branch
to see Kenneally.

248
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,601
You'll love what I got from Painless.

249
00:20:06,065 --> 00:20:08,275
There's this guy's semen
inside her vagina...

250
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:10,027
...but there's nothing outside.

251
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,116
Painless figures she didn't spend
much time on her feet after sex.

252
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:17,245
He says, normally,
he'd see the guy's little thingies...

253
00:20:17,329 --> 00:20:20,708
...swimming upstream in the womb,
when he looked under the microscope.

254
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:23,294
Instead, this guy's was all dead.

255
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:25,965
Nothing went nowhere.

256
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,258
So Painless figures he's sterile.

257
00:20:28,884 --> 00:20:30,719
He's got blood type A.

258
00:20:31,929 --> 00:20:33,305
My very own.

259
00:20:33,723 --> 00:20:36,476
I thought of that. But you got a kid.

260
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:40,480
Anything from hair or fiber?

261
00:20:40,563 --> 00:20:42,567
No hair or skin fragments under her nails.

262
00:20:42,651 --> 00:20:44,528
Carolyn would've fought back.

263
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,239
Maybe she was playing sex games
with the wrong guy.

264
00:20:47,322 --> 00:20:50,744
The rope is K-Mart, Sears, Walgreen's.
You name it.

265
00:20:50,953 --> 00:20:54,665
They found carpet fibers
from some other location. Zorak V.

266
00:20:54,832 --> 00:20:56,960
It's only the biggest seller.

267
00:20:58,295 --> 00:21:01,006
You call the Fingerprint Lab
on the bar glass?

268
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:03,383
Oh, I forgot.

269
00:21:03,466 --> 00:21:05,886
You are a class-A fuck-up, you know?

270
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:08,348
They ain't going to expedite it for me.

271
00:21:08,432 --> 00:21:11,769
I got the phone company printout
on her apartment.

272
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,194
I notice that one of the numbers
that comes up is yours a number of times.

273
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,530
At the office.
We were working cases together.

274
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,532
No, she's calling your home.

275
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,332
She never called me at home.

276
00:21:39,385 --> 00:21:41,095
I made these calls...

277
00:21:41,764 --> 00:21:44,224
...to Barbara from Carolyn's apartment.

278
00:21:45,643 --> 00:21:47,186
"Late again, kid."

279
00:21:48,312 --> 00:21:51,232
"This trial's a bitch.
I'll catch dinner in town."

280
00:21:56,738 --> 00:21:58,909
I'd just as soon you'd let it go.

281
00:22:01,244 --> 00:22:05,417
If Barbara sees a phone company
subpoena, now, she'll bust a gut.

282
00:22:09,922 --> 00:22:12,759
Under the circumstances,
if you don't mind...

283
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,345
...I'd appreciate it.

284
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:20,434
I gave Barbara...

285
00:22:23,605 --> 00:22:25,107
...enough pain.

286
00:22:29,362 --> 00:22:31,280
Polhemus was bad news.

287
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:36,203
Know what they're calling you
and your partner downtown?

288
00:22:36,286 --> 00:22:37,287
Spare me.

289
00:22:37,371 --> 00:22:39,248
"Mission Impossible."

290
00:22:39,623 --> 00:22:42,420
Guerasch, bring that shit in my office.

291
00:22:43,212 --> 00:22:47,216
So you're figuring what? The guy
she was having cocktails with did her?

292
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,306
I figure it was somebody who knew
what he wanted it to look like.

293
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:53,558
Cop. PA. A private dick.

294
00:22:54,183 --> 00:22:57,353
Remember that lady PA
who was here four months ago?

295
00:22:57,479 --> 00:22:58,981
Yeah, nice set of lungs.

296
00:22:59,064 --> 00:23:02,234
This kid's gonna make a copper.
Never forgets a bra size.

297
00:23:02,318 --> 00:23:04,320
He wants to know
what she was looking for.

298
00:23:04,403 --> 00:23:07,324
She was looking for someone
by the name of Noel.

299
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:11,953
It took me a week to find this crap.

300
00:23:12,037 --> 00:23:14,916
Five years back,
they booked 150 a day then.

301
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,418
Public indecency.

302
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:18,837
They were cleaning out the faggots.

303
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,051
Back when Raymond got some balls
for a day and a half.

304
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,679
- She find anything?
- I don't know.

305
00:23:25,846 --> 00:23:29,517
When I gave these files to her,
they were in nice order.

306
00:23:29,893 --> 00:23:32,145
The bitch just trashed them.

307
00:23:32,354 --> 00:23:35,231
She never gave a shit
about anybody else's work.

308
00:23:35,441 --> 00:23:37,443
One's completely missing. Look.

309
00:23:37,526 --> 00:23:40,030
See right here? It skips a number.

310
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:43,117
Tommy Molto been looking at these?

311
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:45,328
What does Molto have to do with this?

312
00:23:45,411 --> 00:23:47,747
Would there still be a court file
on this case?

313
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:51,377
That far back, it'd have to be in storage
on microfilm by now.

314
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,220
You don't want to say
what this is about, maybe?

315
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:01,055
Gee, Lionel, I can't.

316
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:04,141
She used to ask about you, you know.

317
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:07,980
Five, six years ago when she worked
out here as a probation officer.

318
00:24:08,064 --> 00:24:10,692
- Five years ago I didn't know her.
- Sure you did.

319
00:24:10,775 --> 00:24:13,152
The night you brought the Night Saints in.

320
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:15,781
You were hot stuff. A regular fucking hero.

321
00:24:15,864 --> 00:24:18,200
Breaking the meanest guy
this side of Watts.

322
00:24:18,283 --> 00:24:21,329
There was a lot of talk
you'd end up in Horgan's job.

323
00:24:21,413 --> 00:24:23,748
She wanted to know what you were like.

324
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:26,584
I told her you didn't fuck around.

325
00:24:28,504 --> 00:24:30,090
Dad, look who's here.

326
00:24:31,925 --> 00:24:34,720
- How are you?
- Good. Mom's in a good mood.

327
00:24:34,803 --> 00:24:36,682
How'd you know I'd be on this ferry?

328
00:24:36,765 --> 00:24:38,308
Took a chance.

329
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:41,437
How was your day?

330
00:24:42,104 --> 00:24:45,608
Well, I figured out today,
it's ten years this week...

331
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,611
...that I'm working on my dissertation.

332
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,116
I thought we'd celebrate.
Going to take us to dinner?

333
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,538
Why don't you just give up
on that dissertation?

334
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,415
It makes you miserable.

335
00:24:58,958 --> 00:25:01,044
Your mom's not a giver-upper.

336
00:25:01,961 --> 00:25:03,212
Maybe that's her problem.

337
00:25:03,296 --> 00:25:05,631
I sure wouldn't do math unless I had to.

338
00:25:05,715 --> 00:25:08,052
You got my genes in the math department.

339
00:25:08,135 --> 00:25:10,804
If not for your mom,
I'd still be taking algebra.

340
00:25:10,888 --> 00:25:12,890
I had to be good at something.

341
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,061
You were good at everything.

342
00:25:15,811 --> 00:25:17,063
School.

343
00:25:18,773 --> 00:25:20,567
Did you ever cheat?

344
00:25:20,942 --> 00:25:23,029
Like borrow someone else's homework?

345
00:25:23,112 --> 00:25:25,531
Copy it and pretend it was mine?

346
00:25:27,617 --> 00:25:31,455
Why do I have the feeling that question
has some personal relevance?

347
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:33,248
I didn't say I did.

348
00:25:33,624 --> 00:25:35,125
It's all right, kid.

349
00:25:37,754 --> 00:25:39,839
It's good to see you guys happy.

350
00:25:47,474 --> 00:25:48,475
Pretty.

351
00:25:49,935 --> 00:25:51,103
It's new.

352
00:25:52,648 --> 00:25:54,149
It's very pretty.

353
00:26:47,713 --> 00:26:49,798
Mr. Polhemus? I'm Rusty Sabich.

354
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:54,971
Seems so strange to be talking about her
after all these years.

355
00:26:55,847 --> 00:26:58,391
You hadn't had much contact
with her, then?

356
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:00,353
None since she left.

357
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:02,814
What about her family?

358
00:27:02,898 --> 00:27:05,484
I have no idea where she came from.

359
00:27:05,901 --> 00:27:10,366
She lied her way into the university.
Made up some kind of background.

360
00:27:12,076 --> 00:27:14,244
She was very good at playing roles.

361
00:27:16,831 --> 00:27:19,292
When she left me, I lost all pride.

362
00:27:19,793 --> 00:27:21,586
I begged her not to leave.

363
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,883
The last time she looked at me,
it was with disgust.

364
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:29,763
Disgust that somebody she'd looked up to
could be so weak.

365
00:27:30,598 --> 00:27:34,769
At that moment, I had the most
desperate wish that she were dead.

366
00:27:38,107 --> 00:27:42,277
Maybe she made a man feel like that
who actually acted on his fantasy.

367
00:27:44,238 --> 00:27:47,910
Would you like to see what she looked like
at that time?

368
00:27:50,955 --> 00:27:52,290
Yes, I would.

369
00:27:54,627 --> 00:27:57,547
They were taken at about the time
we were married.

370
00:28:12,814 --> 00:28:14,691
This isn't just work?

371
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,405
No.

372
00:28:39,013 --> 00:28:43,351
On the Polhemus thing, what the fuck
is happening to the fingerprints report?

373
00:28:43,685 --> 00:28:47,690
Don't give me that computer crap!
You know I don't understand that shit.

374
00:28:48,274 --> 00:28:51,110
They want to know how big a field
you want it run against?

375
00:28:51,194 --> 00:28:52,779
We could do convicted felons...

376
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:55,949
...anybody ever fingerprinted,
county employees, etc.

377
00:28:56,116 --> 00:28:59,453
Just do felons.
We'll do the rest if we need them.

378
00:28:59,787 --> 00:29:02,083
Do them all. I may never get back on.

379
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:04,210
Do everybody. How soon?

380
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,129
What the fuck takes a week?

381
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:09,717
The man has the biggest murder case
in the city...

382
00:29:09,801 --> 00:29:11,886
...and he has to kiss your ring?

383
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,389
I know. I know.

384
00:29:16,224 --> 00:29:19,228
We don't have jurisdiction
over the computer.

385
00:29:21,855 --> 00:29:25,318
- A week. Probably ten days.
- I need them yesterday.

386
00:29:25,819 --> 00:29:28,863
I'll push, but I don't think
you'll see them any sooner.

387
00:29:28,947 --> 00:29:32,618
Have your copper get the glass back
from Evidence and down to the lab...

388
00:29:32,702 --> 00:29:34,830
...in case they need it for anything.

389
00:29:37,416 --> 00:29:39,002
Ah, Mr. Sabich.

390
00:29:39,795 --> 00:29:41,672
Real important stuff.

391
00:29:41,964 --> 00:29:44,383
We got the chief deputy with us.

392
00:29:44,842 --> 00:29:47,262
Lipranzer and I were wondering,
on your report...

393
00:29:47,345 --> 00:29:51,850
...are you indicating the guy bashed her
after she was strangled by the ropes?

394
00:29:52,016 --> 00:29:53,393
Read the fucking report.

395
00:29:53,476 --> 00:29:54,687
This report?

396
00:29:54,812 --> 00:29:57,898
No, not that report. My report.
The autopsy.

397
00:30:01,653 --> 00:30:03,740
See anything with bruises on the wrists...

398
00:30:03,823 --> 00:30:06,826
...bruises on the ankles,
bruises on the knees?

399
00:30:06,909 --> 00:30:09,872
Are you saying she was raped
and then tied up?

400
00:30:09,997 --> 00:30:11,790
Tied up last, yeah.

401
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:14,835
She already died
from multiple head injuries.

402
00:30:15,252 --> 00:30:17,381
Rape? Now I'm thinking...

403
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,258
...no.

404
00:30:19,633 --> 00:30:20,468
Why?

405
00:30:21,469 --> 00:30:22,970
Read the fucking report.

406
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:24,474
- This report?
- No.

407
00:30:25,641 --> 00:30:27,560
This report? The chemist's report?

408
00:30:27,643 --> 00:30:29,479
Yeah, the chemist's report.

409
00:30:29,812 --> 00:30:33,484
She had a two percent solution
of nonoxynol-9 in her vagina.

410
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:37,654
A spermicide used with a diaphragm.
That's why his sperms were dead.

411
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:40,825
Diaphragm? You missed a diaphragm
in the autopsy?

412
00:30:41,493 --> 00:30:45,121
No. You've been to autopsies.
You slice her wide open.

413
00:30:45,413 --> 00:30:47,541
No diaphragm in that lady.

414
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:49,419
What happened to it?

415
00:30:50,003 --> 00:30:51,421
Somebody took it.

416
00:30:53,673 --> 00:30:55,552
I think it's a setup.

417
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:57,513
This man...

418
00:30:57,846 --> 00:31:00,766
...is her lover. He comes over.
They have drinks.

419
00:31:01,183 --> 00:31:04,687
This lady has intercourse with him.
Real nice. Okay?

420
00:31:05,355 --> 00:31:08,691
But he's an angry guy.
Picks up something, kills her.

421
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:11,112
Tries to make it look like rape.

422
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:12,571
Ties her up.

423
00:31:12,696 --> 00:31:14,533
Pulls out the diaphragm.

424
00:31:15,325 --> 00:31:17,160
That's what I think.

425
00:31:19,705 --> 00:31:21,624
What does Tommy Molto think?

426
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,799
You got his phone number right there.
Want to jot it down in case you need it?

427
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:31,135
Next time you talk to him...

428
00:31:31,218 --> 00:31:33,180
...tell him to call me so I can find out...

429
00:31:33,264 --> 00:31:36,267
...what's going on
in my own fucking investigation.

430
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,811
Painless...

431
00:31:39,146 --> 00:31:41,774
...you tell Molto, and you tell Nico, too...

432
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,527
...that this is cheap, cheap politics.

433
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,821
Cheap Police Department bullshit.

434
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:51,201
God better help them and help you, too.
I can't make a case for tampering.

435
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:56,332
Our poll shows Della Guardia's leading
Horgan by four percent. Eight days left.

436
00:31:57,208 --> 00:31:58,918
At least it's made somebody happy.

437
00:31:59,002 --> 00:32:00,920
I don't want to see you out of here.

438
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,881
Come on, pal. We're old news.

439
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:07,179
I'd miss you. Who else here can talk
morality and ethics and not break me up?

440
00:32:07,262 --> 00:32:12,019
Voters smell an exhausted man who's lost
sight of all the important issues.

441
00:32:12,394 --> 00:32:13,896
Issues? Bullshit.

442
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:17,399
The only issue is Raymond Horgan
has respect for the law...

443
00:32:17,566 --> 00:32:21,821
...and Nico Della Guardia will fuck the law
for politics. That's the issue.

444
00:32:25,074 --> 00:32:26,160
Rusty...

445
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:29,330
Have you ever been to an Irish wake?

446
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:33,419
Come on over and pull up a glass.

447
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:37,423
Know what Della Guardia
is going to find out?

448
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,926
You run for office because...

449
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,223
...you think you can make people do things,
make things better.

450
00:32:44,306 --> 00:32:45,557
But you can't.

451
00:32:45,724 --> 00:32:47,017
Nobody can.

452
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,649
You get a few potholes filled,
keep the lid on the best way you can.

453
00:32:51,732 --> 00:32:53,067
But in the end...

454
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,405
...all you can do is try to hang on
to the fucking job.

455
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:03,246
I never used to drink when I started here.

456
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,917
Then, you still believed
you could make a difference.

457
00:33:09,461 --> 00:33:11,631
Funny, part of me still does.

458
00:33:14,134 --> 00:33:16,261
A guy as tough as you are...

459
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:20,142
...you're still hanging on
to the shreds of your ideals.

460
00:33:20,684 --> 00:33:22,644
The shreds are all I got.

461
00:33:24,813 --> 00:33:26,650
You're a good man, Rusty.

462
00:33:29,153 --> 00:33:30,487
God bless you.

463
00:33:34,492 --> 00:33:36,494
So, tell me, who's our bad guy?

464
00:33:37,829 --> 00:33:40,665
It could be a boyfriend.
Some guy she picked up.

465
00:33:42,835 --> 00:33:46,798
Whoever it is knew enough about her
to know what to make it look like.

466
00:33:47,174 --> 00:33:49,594
Could be a law-enforcement type.

467
00:33:52,221 --> 00:33:53,264
Jesus.

468
00:33:53,347 --> 00:33:54,682
One of us.

469
00:34:05,821 --> 00:34:07,823
You and Carolyn have a thing?

470
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:12,121
Don't beat around the bush.
Just come right out and ask the question.

471
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:19,797
I'll say that the decedent and I
were both single and both adults.

472
00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:23,050
I had a thing with her.

473
00:34:23,717 --> 00:34:26,220
She thought like everybody else thought...

474
00:34:26,303 --> 00:34:28,556
...that I wasn't going to run again.

475
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:32,519
That I could just hand the mantle over
to anyone I chose...

476
00:34:34,605 --> 00:34:36,441
...so why not a broad?

477
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,026
Why not her?

478
00:34:40,195 --> 00:34:41,404
One more question?

479
00:34:41,488 --> 00:34:44,493
I gave her the B file
because she asked me for it.

480
00:34:47,162 --> 00:34:48,997
Because I was fucking her.

481
00:34:50,834 --> 00:34:52,001
Stupid, huh?

482
00:34:53,753 --> 00:34:56,047
She went over to Northside...

483
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,136
...shoveled through the records.

484
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:03,265
There wasn't anything there.

485
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:08,437
At least that's what she told me.

486
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,485
What are you going to do now?

487
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:15,779
Once the party's over?

488
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,489
I don't know.

489
00:35:18,115 --> 00:35:19,658
I got an idea.

490
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,539
Suppose we try to get you on the bench.

491
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:27,628
I should still have enough clout
to pull that off. What do you say?

492
00:35:28,296 --> 00:35:30,923
Why don't we just see
what the future holds.

493
00:35:35,804 --> 00:35:37,973
Would that have satisfied her?

494
00:35:38,348 --> 00:35:39,433
What's that?

495
00:35:39,516 --> 00:35:40,642
A judgeship.

496
00:35:40,726 --> 00:35:44,189
I wonder if a judgeship
would've satisfied Carolyn Polhemus.

497
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,751
Rusty!

498
00:36:00,834 --> 00:36:04,129
Come say hello to Carolyn Polhemus.
Have you met?

499
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,341
I've seen Rusty.

500
00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:10,011
I want to bring Carolyn on board
as a prosecuting attorney.

501
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:14,809
She's been working probation, Northside,
and she just passed her bar exam.

502
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:16,978
Congratulations.

503
00:36:17,062 --> 00:36:18,230
Thank you.

504
00:36:18,355 --> 00:36:20,900
She comes very highly recommended.

505
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,946
Why don't we see if we can find
a nice place for her.

506
00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:27,031
I'd like the Index Division.

507
00:36:27,365 --> 00:36:29,868
That's not a job, it's a jail sentence.

508
00:36:30,118 --> 00:36:32,663
Rape, sex crimes, child molestation.

509
00:36:33,413 --> 00:36:35,249
We can do better than that.

510
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:39,630
It's hard to get a conviction on a rape.
It's a dead-end for someone ambitious.

511
00:36:39,713 --> 00:36:43,386
So you get the worst attorneys
trying the hardest cases?

512
00:36:44,554 --> 00:36:48,057
Listen to this. We got another idealist
in the office.

513
00:36:57,401 --> 00:36:59,237
He's five years old.

514
00:36:59,737 --> 00:37:03,241
The doctors found 23 healed fractures
from old wounds.

515
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,581
Victim of his own beloved mother.

516
00:37:09,082 --> 00:37:10,584
I need your help.

517
00:37:11,251 --> 00:37:12,919
Your wife called.

518
00:37:16,341 --> 00:37:18,177
Why don't you fire her?

519
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:21,389
Civil service. They're here forever.

520
00:37:21,473 --> 00:37:25,018
Why don't you give this to Nancy.
You haven't had experience with kids.

521
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:26,936
Nancy's not available.

522
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:30,232
And, besides,
I'd like to try this case myself.

523
00:37:32,443 --> 00:37:33,778
With your help.

524
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:36,198
Outline it for me.

525
00:37:37,283 --> 00:37:38,743
About a month ago...

526
00:37:38,826 --> 00:37:42,205
...the mother brought him
into the West End Pavilion Hospital.

527
00:37:42,288 --> 00:37:45,125
The boy was unconscious
from severe head injuries.

528
00:37:45,209 --> 00:37:46,877
She said he fell.

529
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,420
The doctor says...

530
00:37:48,754 --> 00:37:52,551
...the head wounds were too symmetrical
to be the result of a fall.

531
00:37:52,968 --> 00:37:54,470
He told me...

532
00:37:54,637 --> 00:37:58,642
...he was treating a child whose mother
had crushed his head in a vise.

533
00:38:00,603 --> 00:38:03,064
We have any proof it was the mother?
You got the vise?

534
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:05,399
Just the testimony of the child.

535
00:38:05,608 --> 00:38:09,780
When he sees the mother in
the courtroom, he'll recant. An iffy case.

536
00:38:10,781 --> 00:38:13,367
I've examined him several times and...

537
00:38:13,951 --> 00:38:15,703
...I think he's begun to trust me.

538
00:38:15,787 --> 00:38:19,707
Look, how many child abuse cases
does this office handle in a year?

539
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:21,084
Over a thousand.

540
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:23,171
Every one of them terrible.

541
00:38:23,797 --> 00:38:25,674
Every one of them heartbreaking.

542
00:38:25,757 --> 00:38:29,052
But I can't stop everything else
to take care of one case.

543
00:38:29,135 --> 00:38:32,266
You're going to have to get somebody else
to help you.

544
00:38:32,933 --> 00:38:34,935
You don't like me, do you?

545
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:39,357
I think you've turned out to be
a damn good prosecutor.

546
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,070
You're angry I didn't have to go
through the channels like everyone else.

547
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,658
Clearly, you're not like everyone else.

548
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:52,165
You think I got this job because
I fucked some fat-cat friend of Raymond's.

549
00:38:55,793 --> 00:38:57,253
Look, it's late...

550
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,843
Come on, I'll drive you to your ferry.

551
00:39:06,221 --> 00:39:08,475
This is not the way to the ferry.

552
00:39:08,893 --> 00:39:10,728
I want you to meet somebody.

553
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:13,022
Wendell, this is Rusty Sabich.

554
00:39:15,818 --> 00:39:18,529
He's a very important man in our office.

555
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:21,699
He's going to help me
when we go to court.

556
00:39:22,701 --> 00:39:25,037
Remember what I told you about court?

557
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:26,413
Yeah.

558
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,665
Now, tell me.

559
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,045
There's a judge and some nice people.

560
00:39:32,128 --> 00:39:34,005
They're called a jury.

561
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:36,799
And you're gonna ask me questions.

562
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,594
About what?

563
00:39:42,224 --> 00:39:44,017
About what happened.

564
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:45,562
When?

565
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:47,773
When I got hurt.

566
00:39:48,232 --> 00:39:50,192
What else did I tell you?

567
00:39:51,151 --> 00:39:54,072
You said that if I told what Mommy did...

568
00:39:54,781 --> 00:39:58,034
...the judge and the nice people
will protect me...

569
00:39:58,284 --> 00:40:00,871
...and Mommy wouldn't hurt me anymore.

570
00:40:01,622 --> 00:40:03,582
Do you think you can do that?

571
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:05,877
Answer my questions in court?

572
00:40:06,586 --> 00:40:08,881
And tell what Mommy did to you?

573
00:40:11,884 --> 00:40:13,553
I think you can.

574
00:40:13,928 --> 00:40:15,722
Mommy will be there.

575
00:40:16,723 --> 00:40:19,810
She can't hurt you.
She can't even talk to you.

576
00:40:20,477 --> 00:40:22,479
You'll be completely safe.

577
00:40:25,025 --> 00:40:26,402
You promise?

578
00:40:28,195 --> 00:40:29,573
I promise.

579
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:40,043
His father got to him last night.

580
00:40:40,127 --> 00:40:43,297
Told him God would put him in hell
if he testified against his mother.

581
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,464
He's terrified.

582
00:40:44,548 --> 00:40:47,927
If you're not ready, we'll ask the judge
for a couple more days.

583
00:40:48,011 --> 00:40:49,012
No.

584
00:40:49,137 --> 00:40:51,806
We've got to do it now
or we'll lose him for good.

585
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:55,228
Your mommy took you to the hospital
because you were hurt.

586
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,731
What part of you was hurt?

587
00:40:58,398 --> 00:40:59,566
My head.

588
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:02,237
How was it hurt?

589
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,245
Wendell, how did you hurt your head?

590
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:14,417
I don't remember.

591
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:20,759
Have you ever seen this?

592
00:41:21,301 --> 00:41:22,260
Yes.

593
00:41:22,344 --> 00:41:23,554
Where?

594
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,723
- In the cellar.
- At home?

595
00:41:25,932 --> 00:41:26,933
Yes.

596
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:29,602
Did somebody put your head inside it?

597
00:41:31,146 --> 00:41:32,397
Wendell?

598
00:41:34,483 --> 00:41:38,111
What did you say when somebody
put your head in the vise?

599
00:41:39,448 --> 00:41:43,369
You told me you screamed
when your head was put in the vise.

600
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:45,914
Remember?

601
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:47,792
You told me.

602
00:41:50,878 --> 00:41:52,255
"I promise...

603
00:41:52,421 --> 00:41:54,007
"...I'll be a good boy.

604
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:55,801
"I'll be a good boy."

605
00:41:56,718 --> 00:41:58,554
Did somebody answer?

606
00:42:00,806 --> 00:42:02,016
Mommy.

607
00:42:02,267 --> 00:42:05,478
Mommy said I was a bad boy
and I deserved to die.

608
00:42:06,104 --> 00:42:08,147
And then what did Mommy do?

609
00:42:08,857 --> 00:42:11,111
She made it tighter and tighter.

610
00:42:11,194 --> 00:42:12,654
On your head?

611
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,657
She hurt my head.
My mommy hurt my head.

612
00:42:17,828 --> 00:42:19,913
No further questions, Your Honor.

613
00:42:19,997 --> 00:42:22,124
The doctors have told us...

614
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:24,001
...that the wounds...

615
00:42:24,084 --> 00:42:27,380
...that Wendell suffered
could not have come from a fall...

616
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:30,008
...as the defense would have you believe.

617
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:34,847
The police told us they found a vise
at the home of the defendant.

618
00:42:35,765 --> 00:42:37,976
Medical experts have testified...

619
00:42:38,143 --> 00:42:41,564
...that the size and the shape
of the jaws of that vise...

620
00:42:41,689 --> 00:42:46,652
...exactly match the size and the shape
of the wounds to the little boy's head.

621
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:49,364
And this evidence is clear...

622
00:42:49,865 --> 00:42:51,533
...and uncontested.

623
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:56,248
But the most compelling evidence
in this trial...

624
00:42:56,332 --> 00:42:59,126
...comes not from doctors,
or police officers...

625
00:42:59,335 --> 00:43:01,546
...or other expert witnesses.

626
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:03,883
The most damning testimony...

627
00:43:04,342 --> 00:43:07,303
...comes from an abused
and frightened child...

628
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:10,474
...who overcame his fear and his pain...

629
00:43:11,183 --> 00:43:13,769
...to tell you, in his own words...

630
00:43:14,561 --> 00:43:16,563
...what really happened.

631
00:43:17,815 --> 00:43:22,070
If you're to remember nothing else
as you begin your deliberations...

632
00:43:22,153 --> 00:43:24,155
...remember Wendell's words:

633
00:43:25,032 --> 00:43:27,077
"My mommy hurt my head."

634
00:43:28,745 --> 00:43:30,789
"My mommy hurt my head."

635
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:37,256
"My mommy hurt my head."

636
00:44:15,718 --> 00:44:17,304
Congratulations.

637
00:44:23,311 --> 00:44:25,229
It's gonna be so good.

638
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:04,294
You're still in love with her.

639
00:47:08,424 --> 00:47:10,134
It was never love.

640
00:47:11,302 --> 00:47:12,972
What was it, then?

641
00:47:19,606 --> 00:47:21,316
It was never love.

642
00:47:24,152 --> 00:47:26,989
What did she have
to make you feel so much?

643
00:47:39,337 --> 00:47:41,172
Ladies and gentlemen...

644
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:43,342
...Raymond Horgan.

645
00:47:59,069 --> 00:48:00,904
Thank you. Thank you.

646
00:48:03,032 --> 00:48:05,161
I wanted to come down
and say a few words...

647
00:48:05,244 --> 00:48:09,540
...before I call Mr. Della Guardia
and congratulate him on his victory.

648
00:48:10,625 --> 00:48:12,209
No, no, no. Come on.

649
00:48:13,587 --> 00:48:17,382
Of all the wonderful things
that have happened to me in 12 years...

650
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,052
...the best has been...

651
00:48:20,762 --> 00:48:23,389
...knowing and working with all of you.

652
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:26,935
Wait till you hear what's going down.
It's strange.

653
00:48:27,018 --> 00:48:30,190
Someone's fucked up over at the Hall.
It's way wrong.

654
00:48:30,273 --> 00:48:31,983
- Why?
- I get a message.

655
00:48:32,067 --> 00:48:36,156
I'm supposed to be in the chief's office
8:00 tomorrow to be interviewed.

656
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:37,240
By Molto.

657
00:48:37,324 --> 00:48:39,284
No discussion. Interview.

658
00:48:39,368 --> 00:48:40,953
It's like they're after me, right?

659
00:48:41,036 --> 00:48:43,331
Another thing. When I came back tonight...

660
00:48:43,414 --> 00:48:46,918
...they took all the receipts
of the evidence I inventoried on Polhemus.

661
00:48:47,001 --> 00:48:48,753
No questions asked.

662
00:48:49,295 --> 00:48:50,798
Sounds like you're off the case.

663
00:48:50,881 --> 00:48:53,258
Sure. Fine, but figure this in.

664
00:48:53,384 --> 00:48:57,305
I'm at the North Branch before 5:00,
going through the microfilm.

665
00:48:57,931 --> 00:49:00,309
All of this hits by 6:00, 6:30.

666
00:49:01,185 --> 00:49:04,105
Look what I picked up
while I was out there.

667
00:49:04,313 --> 00:49:06,525
The case number matches
the complaint number...

668
00:49:06,608 --> 00:49:09,027
...that was missing
when you saw Kenneally.

669
00:49:09,111 --> 00:49:11,113
Five years ago. Bingo.

670
00:49:11,738 --> 00:49:14,785
And look who's listed
as Leon's probation officer.

671
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:18,372
"Carolyn Polhemus."

672
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,458
Wait. Here's the best.

673
00:49:21,419 --> 00:49:24,338
Who do you think was the deputy
handling the case?

674
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:28,301
Tommy Molto.

675
00:49:28,844 --> 00:49:33,056
You keep this because I don't know
what the fuck is happening with me.

676
00:49:40,064 --> 00:49:41,482
Tommy Molto.

677
00:49:42,108 --> 00:49:46,031
Tommy Molto once worked here,
but we think he might be dead.

678
00:49:46,990 --> 00:49:48,575
Raymond's inside.

679
00:49:48,658 --> 00:49:50,493
We've been waiting for you.

680
00:49:58,755 --> 00:49:59,797
Rusty.

681
00:50:01,424 --> 00:50:03,092
Molto and Delay...

682
00:50:04,844 --> 00:50:07,848
...have questions about
the Polhemus investigation.

683
00:50:08,682 --> 00:50:11,019
This should not be handled this way.

684
00:50:11,436 --> 00:50:13,605
You should speak with Rusty alone.

685
00:50:14,774 --> 00:50:15,608
What's this about?

686
00:50:15,691 --> 00:50:18,986
You were at Carolyn's apartment
the night she was killed.

687
00:50:19,111 --> 00:50:20,363
Bullshit.

688
00:50:26,328 --> 00:50:28,538
What was it, a Tuesday night?

689
00:50:30,876 --> 00:50:33,712
Barbara was at the university.
I was babysitting.

690
00:50:33,796 --> 00:50:35,924
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

691
00:50:36,049 --> 00:50:38,219
We got the fingerprint results...

692
00:50:38,302 --> 00:50:40,846
...the ones that you could never remember
to ask for.

693
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:43,432
They're your prints all over the bar glass.

694
00:50:43,516 --> 00:50:45,519
Yours, Rozat K. Sabich.

695
00:50:46,269 --> 00:50:49,064
Five feet from where the woman
was found dead.

696
00:50:49,564 --> 00:50:53,403
Or maybe you didn't remember
that all county employees get printed.

697
00:50:57,907 --> 00:50:59,410
This is absurd.

698
00:51:00,035 --> 00:51:03,081
The phone records
you told Lipranzer not to get?

699
00:51:03,206 --> 00:51:05,458
We had the phone company
pull them this morning.

700
00:51:05,542 --> 00:51:07,504
You were calling her all month.

701
00:51:07,587 --> 00:51:10,590
There's a call from your house
to hers that night.

702
00:51:16,347 --> 00:51:18,266
My God, you're serious.

703
00:51:22,354 --> 00:51:24,106
Tommy, for Christ's sake!

704
00:51:24,315 --> 00:51:25,357
Sabich.

705
00:51:26,109 --> 00:51:28,236
I want you to know one thing. I know.

706
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,237
Sure you do.

707
00:51:29,321 --> 00:51:31,449
Go ahead, play cool. I know.

708
00:51:31,574 --> 00:51:33,909
You killed her. You're the guy.

709
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:35,911
Oh, yeah?

710
00:51:35,995 --> 00:51:38,915
Yeah, you're right. You're always right.

711
00:51:45,799 --> 00:51:48,969
They think I killed her.
They're going to charge me.

712
00:51:49,845 --> 00:51:52,975
Don't be seen with me, man.
They'll fucking bury you.

713
00:51:56,145 --> 00:51:58,939
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

714
00:52:00,817 --> 00:52:02,319
Are you sick?

715
00:52:05,906 --> 00:52:09,327
Nico and Molto are charging me
with Carolyn's murder.

716
00:52:12,121 --> 00:52:15,751
They found my fingerprints
on a glass of beer in her apartment.

717
00:52:19,756 --> 00:52:21,257
What does this mean?

718
00:52:21,383 --> 00:52:23,428
Grand jury investigation.

719
00:52:24,805 --> 00:52:28,600
They will or they won't indict me.
If they do, there'll be a trial.

720
00:52:31,479 --> 00:52:33,690
It's not going to go that far.

721
00:52:36,859 --> 00:52:39,029
I'm going to need a lawyer.

722
00:52:41,365 --> 00:52:44,035
A very, very good lawyer.
Expensive lawyer.

723
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:50,042
It could break us financially.

724
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:53,380
We can mortgage the house.

725
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:56,216
Or sell it if we have to.

726
00:52:59,469 --> 00:53:01,390
What time does Nat get home?

727
00:53:03,058 --> 00:53:04,101
Nat?

728
00:53:07,063 --> 00:53:08,274
Oh, Rusty!

729
00:53:21,872 --> 00:53:24,876
A lot of people think Raymond
shouldn't run again.

730
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:30,715
If he agrees to step aside, the party
will let him decide who will take his place.

731
00:53:32,719 --> 00:53:35,180
They know he won't hand it all to Nico.

732
00:53:35,263 --> 00:53:36,723
That's for sure.

733
00:53:38,393 --> 00:53:40,062
Who would he choose?

734
00:53:41,938 --> 00:53:43,690
Somebody from the office.

735
00:53:44,691 --> 00:53:46,569
Carry on his traditions.

736
00:53:46,736 --> 00:53:47,737
You?

737
00:53:52,116 --> 00:53:53,535
Mac, maybe.

738
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:57,540
She'd make a great candidate,
in that wheelchair.

739
00:53:57,624 --> 00:54:00,126
That chair is not very telegenic.

740
00:54:02,171 --> 00:54:03,881
I think he'd pick you.

741
00:54:06,384 --> 00:54:08,094
You're the natural.

742
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:15,394
Rusty...

743
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:18,440
...if you let him know you want it,
it'll be you.

744
00:54:19,441 --> 00:54:22,069
I should just tell Raymond his time is up?

745
00:54:22,277 --> 00:54:24,115
- You could be tactful.
- No.

746
00:54:25,199 --> 00:54:26,409
Why not?

747
00:54:27,618 --> 00:54:29,787
I'm not going to bite that hand.

748
00:54:30,204 --> 00:54:32,624
If Raymond wants out, that's up to him.

749
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:36,420
He's still the best candidate around,
against Della Guardia.

750
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:39,632
Without Raymond,
Nico doesn't have an issue.

751
00:54:40,008 --> 00:54:43,845
Pull the party's people and Raymond's
people together behind somebody else...

752
00:54:43,928 --> 00:54:46,890
...that person would walk
into the PA's office.

753
00:54:47,433 --> 00:54:49,060
It wouldn't be close.

754
00:54:57,821 --> 00:54:59,990
You've thought a lot about this.

755
00:55:00,741 --> 00:55:02,618
He just needs a push.

756
00:55:06,205 --> 00:55:08,624
Push him yourself. It's not in me.

757
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:16,051
What?

758
00:55:16,801 --> 00:55:19,597
Were you all set on being chief deputy?

759
00:55:21,474 --> 00:55:22,558
Carolyn...

760
00:55:24,644 --> 00:55:28,273
...if I can get away tonight
shall I get some take-out?

761
00:55:29,274 --> 00:55:31,943
I like you, Rusty, but I think it's over.

762
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,657
It's just not right for me now. It's over.

763
00:55:35,741 --> 00:55:37,451
I don't accept that.

764
00:55:37,659 --> 00:55:39,245
You don't accept it?

765
00:55:39,371 --> 00:55:40,873
Do I have a say?

766
00:55:43,417 --> 00:55:45,544
I don't want us to end up enemies.

767
00:55:54,012 --> 00:55:56,057
Mac said it was all right.

768
00:55:56,432 --> 00:55:57,892
Have it your way.

769
00:56:01,145 --> 00:56:02,898
Someone's in my office.

770
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:06,069
What is it, Rusty?

771
00:56:06,152 --> 00:56:09,072
I wanted to talk about this rapist
you habitualized.

772
00:56:09,155 --> 00:56:10,784
There's some problems.

773
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,578
I'm late for an appointment.

774
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:17,082
I would appreciate it
if you could put it in a memo.

775
00:56:17,709 --> 00:56:19,252
You keep avoiding me.

776
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:22,922
You communicate through memos.
You skip meetings I'm supposed to go to.

777
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:24,674
It's affecting work.

778
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:25,884
My work?

779
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:28,262
My work.

780
00:56:29,431 --> 00:56:31,766
I tried to make it easier for you.

781
00:56:34,854 --> 00:56:36,939
You make me feel uncomfortable.

782
00:56:37,023 --> 00:56:40,193
I just want to be with you.
Can't we just talk about it?

783
00:56:41,862 --> 00:56:44,239
I'm involved with someone else.

784
00:56:45,323 --> 00:56:46,616
Since when?

785
00:56:47,117 --> 00:56:49,121
What is it you want from me?

786
00:56:50,998 --> 00:56:52,624
What do I have to do?

787
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:55,963
Grow up.

788
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:35,426
Rozat K. Sabich?

789
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:39,806
Rusty, I don't like to be here.

790
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,142
A search warrant for these premises.

791
00:57:45,021 --> 00:57:46,356
Come on in.

792
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:05,629
They're taking swatches from your suits.

793
00:58:05,879 --> 00:58:09,049
They'll try to match threads
from my clothing and the carpet...

794
00:58:09,133 --> 00:58:11,971
...with fibers they might find
at her apartment.

795
00:58:12,054 --> 00:58:14,557
They're not looking for a murder weapon?

796
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,809
I wouldn't be stupid enough
to bring it home.

797
00:58:16,892 --> 00:58:21,064
If they look for it and don't find it,
they'll have to admit that in court.

798
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:23,900
I'll have to give a blood sample.

799
00:58:24,359 --> 00:58:25,736
If you refuse?

800
00:58:26,279 --> 00:58:28,072
They've got a warrant.

801
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:29,866
It's all routine.

802
00:58:31,075 --> 00:58:33,912
I'm going to ask Sandy Stern
to take my case.

803
00:58:39,919 --> 00:58:41,254
Hi, Sandy.

804
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:52,518
I realize you would like to avoid
public places at a time like this...

805
00:58:52,602 --> 00:58:56,189
...but I don't think it is wise
for you to go into hiding.

806
00:58:57,357 --> 00:59:00,737
I'm flattered that you want me
to represent you in this case.

807
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,448
You have been my toughest adversary.

808
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:08,370
Did you get my subpoena
from the grand jury?

809
00:59:08,537 --> 00:59:11,540
This morning.
Clearly, we will not let you testify.

810
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:16,630
Sandy, you expect me
to take the Fifth Amendment?

811
00:59:16,963 --> 00:59:18,298
Of course.

812
00:59:20,135 --> 00:59:21,553
That I cannot do.

813
00:59:23,138 --> 00:59:27,353
You don't want to prepare the prosecutor
by giving him pretrial statements.

814
00:59:27,436 --> 00:59:31,148
Sandy, I don't think this case
is ever going to go to trial.

815
00:59:31,899 --> 00:59:35,320
If I take the Fifth and refuse to testify
before the grand jury...

816
00:59:35,404 --> 00:59:37,572
...it could destroy my reputation.

817
00:59:40,242 --> 00:59:42,495
The results of the blood tests
have come back.

818
00:59:42,578 --> 00:59:46,207
They have identified you as someone
who secretes A-type antibodies...

819
00:59:46,290 --> 00:59:49,670
...just like the man who had last been
with Ms. Polhemus.

820
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:53,007
Chances of this being a coincidence
are one in ten.

821
00:59:53,133 --> 00:59:57,180
So, I believe you will be charged
and that you will go to trial.

822
00:59:57,347 --> 01:00:02,018
Have you anything to tell this grand jury
about the death of Carolyn Polhemus?

823
01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:05,022
On the advice of counsel,
I decline to answer.

824
01:00:05,273 --> 01:00:09,652
Wouldn't it be fair to say you were rather
well acquainted with Ms. Polhemus?

825
01:00:09,861 --> 01:00:12,155
On the advice of counsel,
I decline to answer.

826
01:00:12,238 --> 01:00:15,033
Weren't you, in fact,
intimate with the lady?

827
01:00:16,536 --> 01:00:19,247
On the advice of counsel,
I decline to answer.

828
01:00:20,291 --> 01:00:23,502
You are under arrest.
"You have the right to remain silent.

829
01:00:23,586 --> 01:00:26,589
"Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

830
01:00:26,797 --> 01:00:30,385
"You have the right to have a lawyer
present during questioning.

831
01:00:30,844 --> 01:00:34,765
"If you cannot hire a lawyer,
one will be appointed to represent you.

832
01:00:36,852 --> 01:00:39,688
"You may stop answering questions
at any time."

833
01:00:39,813 --> 01:00:42,484
Do you understand the rights
I have explained to you?

834
01:00:42,567 --> 01:00:44,653
Call Sandy Stern to make bail.

835
01:00:59,253 --> 01:01:01,255
Sandy should be available in a few hours.

836
01:01:01,339 --> 01:01:03,257
Let's see what they got.

837
01:01:04,092 --> 01:01:06,428
Can't believe there could be
any more surprises.

838
01:01:06,512 --> 01:01:09,849
That's when they come.
That's why they're called surprises.

839
01:01:13,688 --> 01:01:16,191
Do we now understand
Della Guardia's case?

840
01:01:17,609 --> 01:01:19,111
Yes, I think I do.

841
01:01:20,362 --> 01:01:21,864
Let me hear it.

842
01:01:25,785 --> 01:01:28,122
Sabich is obsessed with Polhemus.

843
01:01:28,789 --> 01:01:30,958
She ditches him for another man.

844
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:33,294
Sabich becomes enraged.

845
01:01:33,378 --> 01:01:34,963
He can't let go.

846
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:37,800
One night, knowing his wife is out...

847
01:01:37,883 --> 01:01:40,636
...he calls her and begs her
to see him again.

848
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,223
Carolyn finally agrees.

849
01:01:44,391 --> 01:01:47,310
She rolls around with him
for auld lang syne.

850
01:01:47,602 --> 01:01:49,104
Then something goes wrong.

851
01:01:49,187 --> 01:01:52,651
Sabich is jealous. He wants more
than she's willing to give.

852
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:54,528
He blows it.

853
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:57,323
Gives her what for
with some heavy instrument.

854
01:01:57,532 --> 01:01:59,869
Decides to make it look like rape.

855
01:02:00,202 --> 01:02:04,039
Sabich is a prosecutor,
knows there'll be dozens of suspects.

856
01:02:04,832 --> 01:02:06,168
He ties her up.

857
01:02:06,251 --> 01:02:09,671
Opens the latches to make it look
like someone slipped in.

858
01:02:11,006 --> 01:02:13,258
And this is the diabolical part...

859
01:02:14,051 --> 01:02:16,929
...pulls out her diaphragm
so it looks like rape.

860
01:02:17,221 --> 01:02:20,308
But in his haste and confusion,
he makes mistakes.

861
01:02:21,058 --> 01:02:23,271
He forgets the glass he drank from.

862
01:02:23,438 --> 01:02:27,567
He doesn't think the forensic chemist
will be able to ID the spermicide.

863
01:02:28,359 --> 01:02:30,864
But we know he did evil to this woman...

864
01:02:31,072 --> 01:02:35,577
...because he lied about his presence
in her apartment the night she was killed.

865
01:02:36,077 --> 01:02:38,206
His fingerprints on the glass...

866
01:02:38,289 --> 01:02:40,958
...his blood type A identified from semen...

867
01:02:41,459 --> 01:02:45,339
...fibers from the carpets in his home,
tell us he was there.

868
01:02:47,382 --> 01:02:49,052
Very convincing.

869
01:02:51,221 --> 01:02:53,557
But their evidence of motive is weak.

870
01:02:53,641 --> 01:02:55,726
That's where we must attack.

871
01:02:56,185 --> 01:03:00,357
Is there any proof of prior
amorous relationship between the two?

872
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,691
A few telephone calls.

873
01:03:01,775 --> 01:03:03,902
They can be accounted for
by business needs.

874
01:03:03,985 --> 01:03:05,237
- Any diary?
- No.

875
01:03:05,987 --> 01:03:09,034
No note that came with flowers?
No lovers' correspondence?

876
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,285
- No.
- Good.

877
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:11,954
Gossip will not be admitted.

878
01:03:12,037 --> 01:03:16,043
There are calls from my home to Carolyn's
in October of last year.

879
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:19,171
You were trying the case
of Wendell McGaffney then.

880
01:03:19,463 --> 01:03:21,215
Reason enough for calling her.

881
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:24,636
Why did I tell Lipranzer not to get
my home phone records?

882
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:28,098
I take it for granted that a person
of an innocent state of mind...

883
01:03:28,181 --> 01:03:30,226
...would rule himself out as a suspect...

884
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:33,312
...and save a busy detective
from wasting time.

885
01:03:34,647 --> 01:03:38,570
Clearly, they hope to win the case
on the strength of their physical evidence.

886
01:03:38,653 --> 01:03:41,698
I'd like to look at that glass.
It could help me.

887
01:03:41,781 --> 01:03:44,117
List a motion for production
of physical evidence.

888
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,788
I want an inventory of everything
in that apartment.

889
01:03:46,872 --> 01:03:49,249
Where's the contraceptive jelly...

890
01:03:49,541 --> 01:03:53,337
...the chemist is saying he finds present?
In her medicine cabinet?

891
01:03:53,421 --> 01:03:54,881
I don't know.

892
01:03:57,967 --> 01:03:59,970
I'll hear worse in court.

893
01:04:00,637 --> 01:04:02,973
I never asked her what she was doing.

894
01:04:03,098 --> 01:04:04,642
One word of caution.

895
01:04:04,851 --> 01:04:07,354
We do not want to lead Della Guardia...

896
01:04:07,563 --> 01:04:10,357
...to evidence he has not thought to obtain.

897
01:04:10,816 --> 01:04:14,988
Best we conduct a search ourselves
without disclosing our intentions.

898
01:04:15,572 --> 01:04:20,035
Also, your mention of Carolyn's
personal habits leads to this thought.

899
01:04:21,036 --> 01:04:23,332
We should subpoena her doctors.

900
01:04:23,832 --> 01:04:25,876
Who knows what we might discover.

901
01:04:25,959 --> 01:04:28,378
There's one big surprise, however.

902
01:04:30,174 --> 01:04:32,635
Raymond Horgan's on their witness list.

903
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:34,220
Why?

904
01:04:35,554 --> 01:04:38,225
It's a hell of a way to impress
my new partners.

905
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:41,311
I'm here three days
and I get a grand jury subpoena.

906
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:46,150
I was wondering what we might expect,
in terms of your testimony.

907
01:04:47,985 --> 01:04:52,073
I'm going to testify about Rusty's conduct
of the Polhemus investigation.

908
01:04:52,406 --> 01:04:55,286
- How he volunteered to handle it.
- Just a second.

909
01:04:56,496 --> 01:04:58,498
You insisted I take it on.

910
01:04:58,665 --> 01:05:00,252
I don't remember it that way.

911
01:05:00,335 --> 01:05:02,337
What are you trying to do to me?

912
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,422
What am I trying to do to you?

913
01:05:05,173 --> 01:05:07,259
What are you trying to do to me?

914
01:05:11,097 --> 01:05:13,015
I thought I had your loyalty.

915
01:05:16,645 --> 01:05:19,399
Why didn't you tell me
about you and Carolyn?

916
01:05:19,482 --> 01:05:23,571
Under the circumstances,
I have to advise Rusty not to respond.

917
01:05:24,905 --> 01:05:26,657
Clearly, he would like to.

918
01:05:26,824 --> 01:05:28,868
Let me ask you something.

919
01:05:29,368 --> 01:05:32,497
Why were his fingerprints
all over that goddamn glass?

920
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:36,209
That's what I'm going to testify.

921
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:38,547
That he wanted the case.

922
01:05:38,881 --> 01:05:42,050
That I had to chew his ass
to get him to move on it.

923
01:05:43,177 --> 01:05:45,681
He seemed more interested in if,
when and how...

924
01:05:45,764 --> 01:05:49,185
...I was fucking Carolyn Polhemus
than in his own investigation.

925
01:05:49,268 --> 01:05:51,979
When push came to shove,
he stood in my office...

926
01:05:52,062 --> 01:05:56,693
...he told us he'd been nowhere near
her apartment the night she was killed.

927
01:05:59,654 --> 01:06:01,824
That's what I'm going to testify.

928
01:06:02,408 --> 01:06:04,869
And I'll be goddamned pleased to do it.

929
01:06:05,995 --> 01:06:09,082
How can you think
that I could do a thing like that?

930
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:15,256
You always had the cork in too tight.

931
01:06:16,259 --> 01:06:17,844
We all saw that.

932
01:06:20,263 --> 01:06:22,265
When you blew, you blew.

933
01:06:23,976 --> 01:06:25,561
Come on, Rusty.

934
01:06:33,237 --> 01:06:37,283
When did this relationship take place
between Raymond and Carolyn?

935
01:06:37,575 --> 01:06:39,954
Just after she stopped seeing me.

936
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:44,124
Delay's got his motive.

937
01:06:46,378 --> 01:06:50,882
What if I told you Raymond secretly
assigned a bribery case to Carolyn?

938
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:55,055
Some poor son of a bitch
on a public-indecency charge...

939
01:06:55,138 --> 01:06:57,766
...paid off a PA to have his case dismissed.

940
01:06:57,933 --> 01:07:01,396
Turns out, the guy's probation officer
is Carolyn...

941
01:07:02,106 --> 01:07:05,317
...and the deputy assigned to the case
is Tommy Molto.

942
01:07:06,402 --> 01:07:10,323
Day after I find this out,
I'm charged with Carolyn's murder.

943
01:07:12,826 --> 01:07:15,704
Before we venture down the road
into actual accusation...

944
01:07:15,787 --> 01:07:18,499
...we must consider the matter
very carefully.

945
01:07:21,335 --> 01:07:24,673
It can't be a coincidence
it lays out this way, Sandy.

946
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:32,309
I mean, I'm innocent.

947
01:07:39,692 --> 01:07:42,361
God, I made a fool of myself today
with Sandy.

948
01:07:42,695 --> 01:07:43,821
How?

949
01:07:44,197 --> 01:07:46,032
I told him I was innocent.

950
01:07:47,409 --> 01:07:49,703
I thought he would've asked you that
by now.

951
01:07:49,786 --> 01:07:51,372
No, it's axiomatic.

952
01:07:51,956 --> 01:07:54,209
Defendants rarely tell the truth.

953
01:07:55,336 --> 01:07:59,715
Lie to the cops, lie to your lawyer,
lie to the jury that tries your case.

954
01:08:01,217 --> 01:08:04,221
Leave the bastards out there
with a grain of doubt.

955
01:08:09,978 --> 01:08:11,480
You never asked.

956
01:08:13,482 --> 01:08:15,150
If you're innocent?

957
01:08:20,115 --> 01:08:21,700
You want me to?

958
01:08:38,427 --> 01:08:39,930
Please draw a name.

959
01:08:48,441 --> 01:08:50,360
"Judge Larren Lyttle."

960
01:08:51,194 --> 01:08:53,572
I have some motions from the defense.

961
01:08:53,655 --> 01:08:56,659
Mr. Stern, you want to examine
the scene of the crime?

962
01:08:56,742 --> 01:08:59,579
Yes, Your Honor.
To evaluate the physical evidence...

963
01:08:59,662 --> 01:09:03,125
...to see if it actually proves
what the prosecution claims.

964
01:09:03,333 --> 01:09:04,751
Mr. Della Guardia?

965
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,839
With proviso that nothing be removed,
nothing disturbed.

966
01:09:07,922 --> 01:09:09,924
- No objection.
- Granted.

967
01:09:10,634 --> 01:09:12,636
Mr. Stern, anything further?

968
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:16,307
We notice that Mr. Molto is listed
both as a prosecutor...

969
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:19,811
...and as a witness for the prosecution.
We object to that.

970
01:09:19,936 --> 01:09:22,522
I take it you are speaking
of where Mr. Sabich...

971
01:09:22,606 --> 01:09:26,778
...responds to Mr. Molto's accusation
of murder by saying: "You're right."

972
01:09:28,322 --> 01:09:30,199
"Yeah, you're right."

973
01:09:30,741 --> 01:09:33,204
Your Honor, the man admitted the crime.

974
01:09:33,329 --> 01:09:35,956
Come on, Mr. Delay Guardia. Really.

975
01:09:36,999 --> 01:09:41,087
Tell a man he's engaged in wrongdoing
and he says, "Yeah, you're right."

976
01:09:41,213 --> 01:09:44,591
Everyone knows that's facetious.
We're all familiar with that.

977
01:09:44,674 --> 01:09:48,011
Shit, if Mr. Sabich had come
from my neighborhood...

978
01:09:48,262 --> 01:09:50,515
...he would've said, "Your momma."

979
01:09:51,516 --> 01:09:55,520
But, in Mr. Sabich's part of town
I would think they would say:

980
01:09:56,021 --> 01:09:57,774
"Yeah, you're right."

981
01:09:57,857 --> 01:10:00,652
And what they mean is, "You are wrong."

982
01:10:00,985 --> 01:10:02,695
Just to be polite.

983
01:10:04,866 --> 01:10:08,036
Your Honor, isn't that a question
for the jury?

984
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:12,875
On the contrary, Mr. Delay Guardia,
it is first a question for the court.

985
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:17,880
If you use Mr. Sabich's statement
and risk my ruling it out of order...

986
01:10:18,382 --> 01:10:20,801
...then I will bar Mr. Molto
from prosecuting.

987
01:10:20,884 --> 01:10:23,096
But if he is the prosecutor...

988
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:26,725
...then Mr. Sabich's statement
may not be offered.

989
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:30,396
And I'll see you in court in three weeks.

990
01:10:31,772 --> 01:10:34,317
Ernestine, show in the next bunch.

991
01:10:42,744 --> 01:10:45,163
What the fuck are you doing with those?

992
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:50,087
We don't want Molto thinking fingerprints
we leave here today are from before.

993
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:55,634
We're not going to plant anything,
if that's what you're worried about.

994
01:10:57,888 --> 01:10:59,389
The law's the law.

995
01:11:00,891 --> 01:11:02,893
Yeah, I know, Glendenning.

996
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:10,735
Diaphragm?

997
01:11:12,237 --> 01:11:13,990
I don't know. The bathroom?

998
01:11:14,073 --> 01:11:15,241
Where?

999
01:12:02,714 --> 01:12:03,883
Nothing.

1000
01:12:04,133 --> 01:12:06,470
Fucking cops always forget something.

1001
01:12:07,388 --> 01:12:08,639
What is it?

1002
01:12:08,973 --> 01:12:10,307
Her phone book.

1003
01:12:10,808 --> 01:12:13,728
Check with her doctors
on the contraceptive stuff.

1004
01:12:14,312 --> 01:12:16,940
Carolyn never seemed worried
about anything like that.

1005
01:12:17,023 --> 01:12:20,945
She's got them under "D."
Jesus, she's got a lot of doctors.

1006
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:26,200
If the chemist says spermicide is present,
and it's not seized from here...

1007
01:12:26,284 --> 01:12:28,245
...then you tell me where it's at?

1008
01:12:28,328 --> 01:12:31,833
I don't know. Maybe I took it
when I took the diaphragm.

1009
01:12:32,667 --> 01:12:34,502
It doesn't make sense.

1010
01:12:36,172 --> 01:12:39,509
You got to remember,
I wasn't thinking very clearly.

1011
01:12:41,344 --> 01:12:45,016
If I had been, I wouldn't have left
my fingerprints on the glass.

1012
01:12:46,726 --> 01:12:48,561
You were a former chief deputy prosecutor.

1013
01:12:48,644 --> 01:12:51,231
How does it feel to be on the other side?

1014
01:12:54,277 --> 01:12:56,946
Think you might be a political scapegoat?

1015
01:12:57,196 --> 01:13:00,743
Sorry, we're not about to try this case
on the courthouse steps.

1016
01:13:00,826 --> 01:13:03,120
How do you feel about your husband, now?

1017
01:13:03,203 --> 01:13:04,371
All rise.

1018
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:10,712
The Superior Court for the county
of Kindle is now in session.

1019
01:13:10,795 --> 01:13:14,051
The Honorable Larren L. Lyttle,
judge presiding.

1020
01:13:15,052 --> 01:13:18,305
Draw near and give your attention
and you shall be heard.

1021
01:13:18,388 --> 01:13:21,602
God save the United States
and this honorable court.

1022
01:13:21,769 --> 01:13:24,730
The People vs. Rozat K. Sabich, for trial.

1023
01:13:26,148 --> 01:13:27,859
May it please the court.

1024
01:13:28,026 --> 01:13:31,488
The State's evidence will show
that on or about April 1...

1025
01:13:31,655 --> 01:13:35,075
...Carolyn Polhemus, a deputy prosecutor
in Kindle County...

1026
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:37,745
...was brutally murdered.

1027
01:13:38,746 --> 01:13:42,792
The proof will show that this murder
was perpetrated by her colleague...

1028
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:45,046
...Rozat K. Sabich.

1029
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:49,092
How are we to answer this,
Rusty Sabich and I?

1030
01:13:50,679 --> 01:13:55,183
Mr. Della Guardia's case involves no facts
but supposition upon supposition.

1031
01:13:56,017 --> 01:13:57,727
Guess upon guess.

1032
01:13:59,188 --> 01:14:02,066
When you listen to the evidence,
ask yourselves...

1033
01:14:02,191 --> 01:14:03,943
...why Rusty Sabich...

1034
01:14:04,944 --> 01:14:07,614
...the finest prosecutor of this county...

1035
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:11,995
...a man who has devoted his life
to preventing...

1036
01:14:12,203 --> 01:14:15,874
...and punishing criminal behavior,
not to committing it...

1037
01:14:18,294 --> 01:14:20,462
...sits here as the accused.

1038
01:14:21,965 --> 01:14:23,049
Why?

1039
01:14:23,216 --> 01:14:25,218
The State calls Detective Harold Greer.

1040
01:14:25,302 --> 01:14:27,637
May we have a word with the bench?

1041
01:14:29,141 --> 01:14:33,228
This witness will testify about a bar glass.
They have no bar glass.

1042
01:14:33,687 --> 01:14:35,231
What about this?

1043
01:14:35,565 --> 01:14:38,569
I learned the first time last night,
from Tommy...

1044
01:14:38,986 --> 01:14:41,447
Hold it right there. Inside, gentlemen.

1045
01:14:41,697 --> 01:14:44,743
I request that Mr. Sabich join us
in chambers.

1046
01:14:44,826 --> 01:14:47,329
He is an integral part of the defense.

1047
01:14:50,665 --> 01:14:52,460
Where is the fucking glass?

1048
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:57,214
Police Evidence Room was where it
was supposed to be, but they can't find it.

1049
01:14:57,673 --> 01:15:02,013
We won't be talking about evidence
that nobody can find. Not in my court.

1050
01:15:04,557 --> 01:15:08,855
We don't object to the photographs,
just to testimony about fingerprints.

1051
01:15:09,731 --> 01:15:12,025
I will reserve decision, gentlemen.

1052
01:15:14,362 --> 01:15:17,990
A stroke of luck. Their disorganization
will help us with the jury.

1053
01:15:18,074 --> 01:15:19,992
They'll find the glass. They always do.

1054
01:15:20,076 --> 01:15:23,080
Ladies and gentlemen,
these photos depict horrors...

1055
01:15:23,163 --> 01:15:26,209
...you may be expected to react to
with disgust.

1056
01:15:27,001 --> 01:15:29,296
But I am instructing you,
that in themselves...

1057
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:32,883
...they are proof of nothing
except the nature of the crime.

1058
01:15:46,692 --> 01:15:48,235
How you doing?

1059
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:51,991
- They making it tough on you?
- Those cupcakes? Come on.

1060
01:15:52,616 --> 01:15:54,660
Is there anything you need?

1061
01:15:55,869 --> 01:15:58,831
Yeah, I got to find this guy, Leon.
Leon Wells.

1062
01:15:58,998 --> 01:16:03,003
The guy who's supposed to have bribed
the PA at the North Branch.

1063
01:16:04,296 --> 01:16:07,258
I wouldn't ask, but it might really matter.

1064
01:16:07,550 --> 01:16:11,470
Think Molto's kinky on this?
Set you up to keep you from looking?

1065
01:16:11,804 --> 01:16:15,267
You want to hear me say
I think it might be possible? I do.

1066
01:16:15,392 --> 01:16:17,270
Okay, after I testify.

1067
01:16:17,854 --> 01:16:19,439
They got their eyes on me.

1068
01:16:19,522 --> 01:16:23,528
When I'm off the stand, they'll ease up.
I'll work on it then. Hard.

1069
01:16:24,112 --> 01:16:25,447
You're a pal.

1070
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:29,785
Is he gonna help?

1071
01:16:31,162 --> 01:16:34,081
After he testifies.
Might be too late by then.

1072
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:37,294
I think it's going well.

1073
01:16:38,128 --> 01:16:41,966
The jury's gonna remember pictures
of Carolyn tortured to death.

1074
01:16:43,801 --> 01:16:46,263
They'll want somebody to pay
for what they saw.

1075
01:16:46,347 --> 01:16:47,723
Tomorrow, Raymond...

1076
01:16:47,806 --> 01:16:51,644
...my friend and mentor,
will testify he thinks I'm guilty.

1077
01:16:53,855 --> 01:16:56,024
Then come the physical proofs:

1078
01:16:56,358 --> 01:16:59,069
Fingerprints. Fiber. Bodily fluids.

1079
01:17:03,325 --> 01:17:05,077
They all point to me.

1080
01:17:05,535 --> 01:17:07,998
You know the defendant, Rozat Sabich?

1081
01:17:08,916 --> 01:17:12,628
Sure, I know Rusty. I've known him
since he was a law student.

1082
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:14,171
He was my second in command.

1083
01:17:14,254 --> 01:17:16,091
Would you identify him?

1084
01:17:21,763 --> 01:17:22,974
That's him.

1085
01:17:24,976 --> 01:17:29,105
You assigned Mr. Sabich to supervise
the investigation in this case?

1086
01:17:31,191 --> 01:17:32,694
He volunteered.

1087
01:17:32,777 --> 01:17:34,070
And I accepted.

1088
01:17:34,487 --> 01:17:36,990
He promised to pursue it vigorously.

1089
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:38,326
Did he?

1090
01:17:38,451 --> 01:17:40,620
Not to my way of thinking, no.

1091
01:17:41,621 --> 01:17:44,457
I got the feeling he was stalling
on the investigation.

1092
01:17:44,541 --> 01:17:47,461
I let him know that I wasn't happy
about that.

1093
01:17:49,839 --> 01:17:53,051
He brought in his own detective
to replace Harold Greer.

1094
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:56,764
Then he gave his new partner instructions
to ignore evidence...

1095
01:17:56,848 --> 01:18:00,143
...about telephone calls
between his house and Carolyn's.

1096
01:18:01,478 --> 01:18:05,524
He tried to limit the scope of
the fingerprint search to exclude his own.

1097
01:18:07,943 --> 01:18:12,324
He was more interested in whether I had
been intimate with Carolyn Polhemus...

1098
01:18:12,574 --> 01:18:14,826
...than in the facts surrounding her murder.

1099
01:18:14,909 --> 01:18:17,497
What did you tell him
about you and Ms. Polhemus?

1100
01:18:17,581 --> 01:18:19,166
I told him the truth.

1101
01:18:19,875 --> 01:18:22,128
That we'd been together
for about three months.

1102
01:18:22,211 --> 01:18:24,340
This, of course, was after I was divorced.

1103
01:18:24,423 --> 01:18:26,592
At that time, or any other time...

1104
01:18:26,717 --> 01:18:29,553
...did he inform you
of his personal relationship with her?

1105
01:18:29,637 --> 01:18:33,767
There is no proof in the record
of any relationship between them.

1106
01:18:34,184 --> 01:18:36,186
I'll let the question stand.

1107
01:18:37,187 --> 01:18:41,609
But Mr. Della Guardia is asking a question
based on his assumption...

1108
01:18:42,234 --> 01:18:46,531
...that something was going on
between Mr. Sabich and Ms. Polhemus.

1109
01:18:46,907 --> 01:18:49,160
Just because he thinks it's so...

1110
01:18:49,410 --> 01:18:51,079
...doesn't make it so.

1111
01:18:51,871 --> 01:18:53,039
Proceed.

1112
01:18:53,833 --> 01:18:56,378
I never would've let him handle
the investigation...

1113
01:18:56,461 --> 01:18:59,464
...if I thought he'd been intimate
with the victim.

1114
01:18:59,923 --> 01:19:01,592
Nothing further.

1115
01:19:02,218 --> 01:19:03,761
Have you any...

1116
01:19:04,053 --> 01:19:05,972
...personal knowledge...

1117
01:19:06,097 --> 01:19:10,310
...that there was ever a relationship
between Mr. Sabich and Ms. Polhemus?

1118
01:19:10,602 --> 01:19:12,354
That's the point. He didn't tell me.

1119
01:19:12,437 --> 01:19:14,816
Please answer the question I asked you.

1120
01:19:16,234 --> 01:19:18,195
Do you remember the question?

1121
01:19:18,404 --> 01:19:19,405
I do.

1122
01:19:19,947 --> 01:19:22,032
But you chose not to answer it.

1123
01:19:22,908 --> 01:19:24,703
I apologize, Mr. Stern.

1124
01:19:24,953 --> 01:19:28,748
I have no personal knowledge
that such a relationship ever existed.

1125
01:19:28,999 --> 01:19:31,628
Assuming there was something
to disclose...

1126
01:19:31,753 --> 01:19:36,133
...you believe he should have informed
anyone in a responsible position?

1127
01:19:36,216 --> 01:19:37,009
I do.

1128
01:19:37,092 --> 01:19:40,597
Certainly you would give any information
you had on a case...

1129
01:19:40,723 --> 01:19:42,975
...to your investigating staff?

1130
01:19:43,142 --> 01:19:44,435
Certainly.

1131
01:19:45,311 --> 01:19:46,563
Mr. Horgan...

1132
01:19:47,022 --> 01:19:50,108
...you removed a file, a so-called B file...

1133
01:19:50,442 --> 01:19:54,655
...from Ms. Polhemus's office after
the investigation of her murder began?

1134
01:19:55,072 --> 01:19:56,824
What's the relevance of this?

1135
01:19:56,907 --> 01:19:59,785
The witness has testified
on direct examination...

1136
01:19:59,869 --> 01:20:03,750
...that Mr. Sabich did not bring
to his attention information...

1137
01:20:03,916 --> 01:20:05,501
...that he regarded as pertinent.

1138
01:20:05,585 --> 01:20:10,216
The defense is entitled to explore
Mr. Horgan's standards in this regard.

1139
01:20:10,842 --> 01:20:13,762
Subject to a later connection, I'll allow it.

1140
01:20:14,596 --> 01:20:16,097
Continue, Counselor.

1141
01:20:16,598 --> 01:20:19,518
And you gave that B file to Mr. Sabich...

1142
01:20:19,935 --> 01:20:23,981
...only after he informed you it was missing
from Ms. Polhemus's office?

1143
01:20:24,816 --> 01:20:26,193
That's true.

1144
01:20:27,277 --> 01:20:30,198
You've told us that you
and Carolyn were lovers.

1145
01:20:30,782 --> 01:20:32,409
For a short time, yes.

1146
01:20:33,452 --> 01:20:34,995
B-file cases...

1147
01:20:35,454 --> 01:20:38,540
...cases involving bribery
and official misconduct...

1148
01:20:38,999 --> 01:20:42,212
...are normally assigned
to the assistant deputy.

1149
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:45,215
At the time, Mr. Sabich. Is that not true?

1150
01:20:45,298 --> 01:20:47,092
That was the usual practice, yes.

1151
01:20:47,177 --> 01:20:50,806
You gave this highly sensitive matter
in this B file...

1152
01:20:51,014 --> 01:20:54,018
...to Carolyn Polhemus
while you were sleeping with her?

1153
01:20:54,102 --> 01:20:56,230
That appears to be the time frame.

1154
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,609
The answer to the question is yes.

1155
01:21:02,027 --> 01:21:06,741
Weren't you concerned, in the midst
of a nip-and-tuck election campaign...

1156
01:21:07,158 --> 01:21:10,579
...about word leaking out
that you had secretly given a file...

1157
01:21:10,663 --> 01:21:13,040
...that was in Mr. Sabich's area
of authority...

1158
01:21:13,124 --> 01:21:15,876
...to an assistant with no experience
in such matters...

1159
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,547
...with whom you were sleeping
at the time?

1160
01:21:19,674 --> 01:21:21,676
It may have crossed my mind.

1161
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:25,682
Who knows? It was not an ideal situation.

1162
01:21:27,183 --> 01:21:28,435
Far from it.

1163
01:21:30,228 --> 01:21:31,438
And, sir...

1164
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:33,983
...you come to this courtroom...

1165
01:21:34,066 --> 01:21:36,027
...where the life of a man...

1166
01:21:36,152 --> 01:21:40,324
...who served you faithfully for 12 years
now hangs in the balance...

1167
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:43,201
...and you tell us
you withheld evidence from him...

1168
01:21:43,285 --> 01:21:46,372
...that might have assisted
in his investigation?

1169
01:21:58,219 --> 01:21:59,346
All right.

1170
01:22:02,934 --> 01:22:04,561
Is it fair to say...

1171
01:22:05,062 --> 01:22:08,106
...that the chief deputy is the person
in the office...

1172
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:11,362
...in whose judgement you place
the greatest confidence?

1173
01:22:13,197 --> 01:22:16,200
I regarded him as the best lawyer
for the job, yes.

1174
01:22:16,325 --> 01:22:18,995
And you gave Mr. Sabich the authority...

1175
01:22:19,454 --> 01:22:22,832
...to decide when and where
to fire Mr. Della Guardia?

1176
01:22:23,041 --> 01:22:24,417
Gentlemen...

1177
01:22:25,001 --> 01:22:26,837
...let's stop right there.

1178
01:22:28,839 --> 01:22:31,342
What is the relevance of who fired who?

1179
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:35,890
Judge, it's our theory that Mr. Sabich
is being framed in this case.

1180
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:40,311
- I don't believe it.
- Your response has been noted.

1181
01:22:40,561 --> 01:22:43,733
If Mr. Stern is truly going to endeavor
to prove...

1182
01:22:43,858 --> 01:22:47,320
...that the case against Mr. Sabich
has been manufactured...

1183
01:22:47,445 --> 01:22:51,242
...then this history of antagonism
is relevant for those purposes.

1184
01:22:51,367 --> 01:22:53,661
What about this missing B file?

1185
01:22:53,744 --> 01:22:56,790
We believe it's being withheld
because it contains evidence...

1186
01:22:56,873 --> 01:22:59,001
...that is necessary to the defense.

1187
01:22:59,084 --> 01:23:01,838
So, we intend to pursue this matter...

1188
01:23:02,296 --> 01:23:06,093
...until we have a full understanding
on how it bears on the truth.

1189
01:23:06,427 --> 01:23:10,180
I don't know where this will lead us,
but I'll tell you two things:

1190
01:23:10,347 --> 01:23:13,143
You'd better be prepared
for the prosecution's response...

1191
01:23:13,226 --> 01:23:17,647
...because he is going to be entitled
to a great deal of latitude in answering.

1192
01:23:17,981 --> 01:23:20,277
'Cause I am going to give him that.

1193
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:29,288
Do you recall we spoke about a B file
that you assigned to Ms. Polhemus?

1194
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:32,124
I'll remember it for quite some time.

1195
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:35,378
- Was Mr. Molto involved in this case?
- Objection!

1196
01:23:35,503 --> 01:23:37,005
Objection sustained.

1197
01:23:37,172 --> 01:23:39,799
Mr. Stern, you're playing with fire.

1198
01:23:41,427 --> 01:23:44,972
Do you know what investigation, if any,
Mr. Molto pursued...

1199
01:23:45,056 --> 01:23:47,099
I'll answer that! He took no action.

1200
01:23:47,183 --> 01:23:49,644
He wasn't going to chase
Sabich's red herrings.

1201
01:23:49,728 --> 01:23:53,191
Mr. Della Guardia, you will remember
you're the prosecutor...

1202
01:23:53,274 --> 01:23:54,859
...not the witness.

1203
01:24:00,742 --> 01:24:04,997
Perhaps we can all learn something
about red herrings and scapegoats.

1204
01:24:05,998 --> 01:24:07,416
That is all.

1205
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:10,419
This court is adjourned for the weekend.

1206
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:14,341
I don't understand what you're doing.

1207
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:16,761
You're alienating the judge.

1208
01:24:17,011 --> 01:24:21,100
When I said they manufactured a case,
you wanted nothing to do with it.

1209
01:24:21,517 --> 01:24:23,560
Clearly, I changed my mind.

1210
01:24:23,852 --> 01:24:25,479
On the basis of what?

1211
01:24:25,896 --> 01:24:27,107
Instinct.

1212
01:24:31,236 --> 01:24:33,655
If you don't like it,
you can always come home.

1213
01:24:33,738 --> 01:24:35,033
I wanna go.

1214
01:24:35,450 --> 01:24:37,411
All my friends will be there.

1215
01:24:38,078 --> 01:24:39,454
I'll be okay.

1216
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:45,587
Come here. Sit down.

1217
01:24:47,589 --> 01:24:50,427
Look, I'm accused of doing something
I didn't do.

1218
01:24:51,094 --> 01:24:54,597
This trial is gonna give me a chance
to clear myself.

1219
01:24:55,306 --> 01:24:57,518
- That's what's gonna happen.
- Of course.

1220
01:24:57,601 --> 01:24:58,811
Of course.

1221
01:25:00,021 --> 01:25:02,523
Here are the postcards. Use them.

1222
01:25:02,648 --> 01:25:04,985
- Don't forget to write.
- They make me.

1223
01:25:05,485 --> 01:25:06,904
What about me?

1224
01:25:17,625 --> 01:25:19,210
Did Mr. Sabich ever tell you...

1225
01:25:19,294 --> 01:25:22,381
...he had a personal relationship
with Ms. Polhemus?

1226
01:25:22,923 --> 01:25:23,924
No.

1227
01:25:24,383 --> 01:25:26,052
Did Mr. Sabich, at any time...

1228
01:25:26,135 --> 01:25:29,973
...order you not to get phone records
of calls from his home?

1229
01:25:30,098 --> 01:25:32,518
He never ordered me. He asked me.

1230
01:25:32,685 --> 01:25:35,272
He asked you not to get those records?

1231
01:25:35,606 --> 01:25:36,732
Did you oblige him?

1232
01:25:36,815 --> 01:25:39,943
I was taken off the case
before I got to those records.

1233
01:25:40,069 --> 01:25:42,781
- You did or did not get those records?
- I did not.

1234
01:25:42,864 --> 01:25:45,992
We had a lot of higher-priority items
on our mind.

1235
01:25:47,744 --> 01:25:49,204
A high-priority item...

1236
01:25:49,287 --> 01:25:53,752
...was the analysis of fingerprints found
in Ms. Polhemus's apartment.

1237
01:25:54,044 --> 01:25:56,088
Who talked with the Fingerprint Lab?

1238
01:25:56,171 --> 01:25:57,298
Mr. Sabich.

1239
01:25:57,382 --> 01:25:59,343
Did you ask him to expedite the reports?

1240
01:25:59,426 --> 01:26:00,511
Yes, sir, I did.

1241
01:26:00,594 --> 01:26:02,888
What did he say, if anything?

1242
01:26:03,555 --> 01:26:04,932
He said he forgot.

1243
01:26:05,015 --> 01:26:06,351
He forgot?

1244
01:26:09,604 --> 01:26:11,106
Rusty forgot.

1245
01:26:12,190 --> 01:26:15,403
Would it be fair to say the two of you,
by working together...

1246
01:26:15,486 --> 01:26:17,822
...have formed a personal friendship?

1247
01:26:18,406 --> 01:26:19,990
I suppose so, yes.

1248
01:26:20,324 --> 01:26:21,953
Were you assigned initially?

1249
01:26:22,036 --> 01:26:24,706
Harold Greer initially handled the case.

1250
01:26:25,998 --> 01:26:28,253
Has Mr. Sabich ever expressed to you...

1251
01:26:28,336 --> 01:26:31,381
...any reservations about
Harold Greer's abilities?

1252
01:26:31,631 --> 01:26:35,260
Everybody that I know thinks
of Harold Greer as a top-grade cop.

1253
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:39,640
Do you know who decided to replace
Harold Greer and bring you on this case?

1254
01:26:39,724 --> 01:26:41,142
Mr. Sabich.

1255
01:26:43,562 --> 01:26:44,855
Do you feel...

1256
01:26:44,938 --> 01:26:46,022
Withdrawn.

1257
01:26:46,523 --> 01:26:50,445
To your knowledge, does the defendant
have a closer personal relationship...

1258
01:26:50,528 --> 01:26:53,991
...with anyone on the police force
than he does with you?

1259
01:26:54,533 --> 01:26:56,452
Not that he's mentioned, no.

1260
01:26:56,952 --> 01:26:59,080
So it's fair to say, Detective...

1261
01:26:59,164 --> 01:27:03,793
...that you are the police officer
least likely to suspect him of murder.

1262
01:27:04,669 --> 01:27:07,257
I would never believe that. Never.

1263
01:27:07,758 --> 01:27:09,968
Thank you for your cooperation
and answering...

1264
01:27:10,052 --> 01:27:13,514
...what must have been painful
and difficult questions for you...

1265
01:27:13,599 --> 01:27:16,310
...considering your relationship
to the defendant.

1266
01:27:16,393 --> 01:27:17,728
Nothing further.

1267
01:27:21,274 --> 01:27:24,110
You made reference to a theory
you were developing that...

1268
01:27:24,194 --> 01:27:27,363
...Ms. Polhemus might have been
the victim of a revenge killer.

1269
01:27:27,447 --> 01:27:29,283
Someone she had once sent to jail.

1270
01:27:29,366 --> 01:27:32,953
Yes, sir. We thought of that
as our most likely case.

1271
01:27:33,370 --> 01:27:35,706
To identify possible suspects...

1272
01:27:36,165 --> 01:27:40,797
...you reviewed cases she had prosecuted,
and was currently prosecuting...

1273
01:27:40,963 --> 01:27:42,882
...going back several years? Correct?

1274
01:27:42,965 --> 01:27:44,094
Yes, sir.

1275
01:27:44,344 --> 01:27:46,429
Were you able to find all those files?

1276
01:27:46,513 --> 01:27:48,515
No, sir. A file was missing.

1277
01:27:49,099 --> 01:27:51,477
This is the so-called B file...

1278
01:27:51,811 --> 01:27:54,313
...that was withheld
from you and Mr. Sabich...

1279
01:27:54,397 --> 01:27:57,858
...until Mr. Sabich requested it personally
from Mr. Horgan?

1280
01:27:58,150 --> 01:27:59,194
Yes, sir.

1281
01:27:59,277 --> 01:28:00,987
It involved allegations...

1282
01:28:01,071 --> 01:28:02,489
Let's move on.

1283
01:28:03,533 --> 01:28:07,121
You've been warned about riding off
in all directions.

1284
01:28:07,371 --> 01:28:08,914
No further questions.

1285
01:28:09,540 --> 01:28:11,375
No redirect, Your Honor.

1286
01:28:12,084 --> 01:28:14,963
We need subpoenas for Carolyn's doctors...

1287
01:28:15,255 --> 01:28:17,090
...and for phone company records...

1288
01:28:17,173 --> 01:28:19,050
...to check for errors.

1289
01:28:19,384 --> 01:28:21,930
I don't think we need to bother with that.

1290
01:28:22,806 --> 01:28:26,017
You said there was something wrong
with the phone records.

1291
01:28:26,101 --> 01:28:29,272
That you never called Polhemus
the night of the murder.

1292
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:35,028
Jamie, I'd like a moment alone
with my client.

1293
01:28:38,366 --> 01:28:39,784
- Sure.
- Thanks.

1294
01:28:49,253 --> 01:28:52,299
I used to call Carolyn's apartment
after it was over.

1295
01:28:54,510 --> 01:28:55,887
I'd call...

1296
01:28:58,598 --> 01:29:00,143
...just to hear her voice.

1297
01:29:00,226 --> 01:29:02,520
Then I'd hang up, like a goddamn kid.

1298
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:09,028
I'm not sure I called that night or not.
I don't remember.

1299
01:29:11,322 --> 01:29:15,494
Contrary to my original hopes,
we will have to present a defense.

1300
01:29:22,628 --> 01:29:24,296
My first instinct is...

1301
01:29:24,463 --> 01:29:26,423
...to put Barbara on the witness stand.

1302
01:29:26,507 --> 01:29:27,424
No.

1303
01:29:27,508 --> 01:29:31,012
She's an attractive woman
and there are five men in the jury.

1304
01:29:31,137 --> 01:29:34,057
She can also support your alibi
quite effectively.

1305
01:29:34,140 --> 01:29:35,975
It's not negotiable, Sandy.

1306
01:29:42,567 --> 01:29:44,362
When I was a prosecutor...

1307
01:29:44,445 --> 01:29:48,700
...I always knew I had a winner
when the defendant refused to testify.

1308
01:29:50,411 --> 01:29:52,496
All I want to do is to tell the truth.

1309
01:29:52,579 --> 01:29:55,667
The jury wants to hear me say
I didn't do it.

1310
01:29:55,834 --> 01:29:58,128
And that, you will do very well.

1311
01:30:01,924 --> 01:30:05,845
But with every word, you will confirm
what the prosecution is saying.

1312
01:30:05,970 --> 01:30:08,515
That you were overwhelmed
with a sexual obsession...

1313
01:30:08,598 --> 01:30:12,437
...that took a wrong turn into rage
when she ended the affair.

1314
01:30:13,187 --> 01:30:17,610
You will have gone a long way
to eliminating the jury's reasonable doubt.

1315
01:30:18,653 --> 01:30:20,655
The State offers as evidence...

1316
01:30:21,156 --> 01:30:23,409
...from the defendant's suitcoat...

1317
01:30:23,534 --> 01:30:27,371
...a hair identified by the Police Crime Lab
as that of the deceased.

1318
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:31,376
The skirt of the deceased contaminated
with fiber identified as Zorak V...

1319
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:34,589
...a carpet fabric found
in the home of the defendant.

1320
01:30:35,339 --> 01:30:37,842
Chemist's identification of blood type...

1321
01:30:38,009 --> 01:30:41,472
...and semen from the vagina
of the deceased as type A.

1322
01:30:41,972 --> 01:30:44,683
Results of a blood test of Rozat Sabich...

1323
01:30:44,767 --> 01:30:47,187
...identifying his as blood type A.

1324
01:30:48,354 --> 01:30:52,484
The shirt of the deceased,
contaminated with the fiber Zorak V...

1325
01:30:53,278 --> 01:30:55,989
...carpet fabric used
in the defendant's home.

1326
01:31:00,203 --> 01:31:02,581
The State calls
Detective Morris Dickerman.

1327
01:31:02,664 --> 01:31:04,833
This relates to missing evidence.

1328
01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:07,211
I hope you're not considering
allowing them...

1329
01:31:07,294 --> 01:31:10,757
...to proceed with the fingerprint evidence
in the absence of the glass.

1330
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:14,135
If so, we would like to be heard
on that question.

1331
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,388
I understand that.

1332
01:31:16,764 --> 01:31:20,017
You may want to do some research
into this issue.

1333
01:31:20,726 --> 01:31:24,356
You hit the books tonight
and I'll listen to you tomorrow.

1334
01:31:25,233 --> 01:31:26,901
And if I were you...

1335
01:31:27,276 --> 01:31:31,030
...I'd roll up my shirtsleeves
and go to the Evidence Room...

1336
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:33,118
...and find that glass.

1337
01:31:33,576 --> 01:31:36,246
You're not going to get any sleep again.

1338
01:31:36,371 --> 01:31:40,042
That glass is the strongest piece
of physical evidence that I was there.

1339
01:31:40,126 --> 01:31:45,172
If I can find solid precedents to keep it
out of evidence, their case will fail.

1340
01:31:48,885 --> 01:31:51,973
Get something to eat
and don't drink too much coffee.

1341
01:31:54,726 --> 01:31:55,936
Thanks.

1342
01:31:56,019 --> 01:31:57,187
For what?

1343
01:31:57,563 --> 01:31:59,231
For hanging in there.

1344
01:32:01,066 --> 01:32:02,610
What did you expect?

1345
01:32:17,129 --> 01:32:18,630
Yeah, just a sec.

1346
01:32:20,966 --> 01:32:22,301
It's your uncle.

1347
01:32:24,554 --> 01:32:25,722
My uncle?

1348
01:32:32,813 --> 01:32:35,816
We got something
on that very important matter.

1349
01:32:37,067 --> 01:32:39,028
I'm downstairs, in the lobby.

1350
01:32:40,405 --> 01:32:43,242
We're working to keep the glass
out of evidence.

1351
01:32:43,409 --> 01:32:45,578
Fuck the glass. I found Leon.

1352
01:32:45,787 --> 01:32:47,999
Feature this. He's a Night Saint.

1353
01:33:15,197 --> 01:33:16,198
Leon!

1354
01:33:17,784 --> 01:33:19,452
Answer the door.

1355
01:33:26,128 --> 01:33:28,380
Open up, Leon! It's the police!

1356
01:33:28,964 --> 01:33:30,882
We just want to talk, Leon.

1357
01:33:37,808 --> 01:33:39,059
On the floor!

1358
01:33:40,895 --> 01:33:43,565
- Don't even breathe!
- What the fuck you doing?

1359
01:33:47,736 --> 01:33:49,113
I'm Detective Lipranzer.

1360
01:33:49,196 --> 01:33:52,032
This is Mr. Sabich
from the prosecutor's office.

1361
01:33:52,158 --> 01:33:54,118
We have a few questions, Leon.

1362
01:33:54,285 --> 01:33:57,331
If you're straight with us,
we're gone in five minutes.

1363
01:33:57,415 --> 01:33:59,959
Five, six years ago,
you paid off a deputy PA...

1364
01:34:00,042 --> 01:34:03,214
...$1,500 to make some trouble
you had go away.

1365
01:34:03,798 --> 01:34:05,133
555-3469.

1366
01:34:06,259 --> 01:34:08,094
Jack Friedman, you ask for.

1367
01:34:12,600 --> 01:34:14,185
What the fuck he do that for?

1368
01:34:14,268 --> 01:34:16,770
He wants your complete attention.

1369
01:34:17,271 --> 01:34:21,944
Rusty Sabich is getting on the phone,
he will tell your present associates...

1370
01:34:22,028 --> 01:34:26,783
...that five years ago you paid off a PA
to get off a rap on molesting an officer.

1371
01:34:27,159 --> 01:34:28,202
To wit:

1372
01:34:28,535 --> 01:34:32,122
Trying to get paid to suck his cock
in a public place.

1373
01:34:33,333 --> 01:34:34,584
Now, Leon...

1374
01:34:36,127 --> 01:34:38,755
How about five minutes of your time?

1375
01:34:48,185 --> 01:34:50,020
This blonde bitch...

1376
01:34:51,396 --> 01:34:53,899
...my probation officer, set it up.

1377
01:34:55,484 --> 01:34:57,278
In the PA's office.

1378
01:34:58,363 --> 01:35:00,281
Man standing behind me.

1379
01:35:06,163 --> 01:35:08,666
And she be telling me, when I come in:

1380
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,003
"Just don't turn around.

1381
01:35:13,339 --> 01:35:15,341
"Just do what the man say."

1382
01:35:17,969 --> 01:35:19,180
He said:

1383
01:35:22,684 --> 01:35:25,353
"Just leave the money in the top drawer."

1384
01:35:28,274 --> 01:35:30,317
Fifteen hundred dollars.

1385
01:35:31,694 --> 01:35:33,362
You never saw him?

1386
01:35:34,197 --> 01:35:36,199
But he knows who it was.

1387
01:35:44,835 --> 01:35:46,545
Judge Motherfucker.

1388
01:35:49,215 --> 01:35:51,217
That's what we all call him.

1389
01:35:54,846 --> 01:35:56,391
Larren Lyttle.

1390
01:35:59,144 --> 01:36:01,104
I bet Larren was porking her...

1391
01:36:01,188 --> 01:36:03,901
...and taking the money
to keep her in style.

1392
01:36:05,402 --> 01:36:07,529
Sometimes I hate being a cop.

1393
01:36:11,534 --> 01:36:14,787
Sorry, pal. You were counting
on it being Molto.

1394
01:36:20,169 --> 01:36:24,381
If you leak this stuff we got on him
to Larren, he might dismiss your case.

1395
01:36:30,056 --> 01:36:32,225
Okay, it was just a thought.

1396
01:36:34,812 --> 01:36:35,814
All rise!

1397
01:36:35,897 --> 01:36:39,067
This court is in session.
Judge Larren Lyttle presiding.

1398
01:36:45,825 --> 01:36:47,243
Where's Kemp?

1399
01:36:47,785 --> 01:36:52,582
We just received the medical examiner's
files on the reports from her doctors.

1400
01:36:52,749 --> 01:36:54,752
He's going over them right now.

1401
01:36:54,836 --> 01:36:58,090
We may have a surprise
in the medical testimony.

1402
01:37:00,759 --> 01:37:03,595
Mr. Molto, you have completed
your search?

1403
01:37:09,811 --> 01:37:11,271
Your Honor...

1404
01:37:11,479 --> 01:37:14,568
...the police have not been able
to locate the glass.

1405
01:37:14,818 --> 01:37:15,944
All right.

1406
01:37:16,444 --> 01:37:18,948
Mr. Stern, I have studied your arguments.

1407
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:22,995
You are about to hear the testimony
of a fingerprint expert...

1408
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:27,417
...concerning evidence that he claims
to have identified on a certain glass.

1409
01:37:28,418 --> 01:37:33,214
I am instructing you as a matter of law
that you are entitled to consider...

1410
01:37:33,506 --> 01:37:37,970
...the prosecution's failure to make
the glass available to the defense.

1411
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:40,431
I am not telling you what to do.

1412
01:37:40,973 --> 01:37:43,644
But it is permissible
for that one fact alone...

1413
01:37:43,728 --> 01:37:48,274
...to raise a reasonable doubt
that would require Mr. Sabich's acquittal.

1414
01:37:49,609 --> 01:37:51,863
Mr. Stern's objection is overruled.

1415
01:37:52,572 --> 01:37:55,283
His exception is noted for the record.
Proceed.

1416
01:37:55,825 --> 01:37:56,951
I'm sorry.

1417
01:37:57,953 --> 01:37:59,830
He's right, under the law.

1418
01:38:00,623 --> 01:38:04,627
Based on the lateral slash
on the anterior portion of the fingerprint...

1419
01:38:04,919 --> 01:38:07,130
...the distinctive center whorl...

1420
01:38:07,506 --> 01:38:10,301
...and the exact match on the top swirl...

1421
01:38:11,302 --> 01:38:15,933
...I am certain the fingerprint on the glass
from Polhemus's apartment...

1422
01:38:16,808 --> 01:38:21,022
...is identical to that contained in
the employment file of Rozat K. Sabich.

1423
01:38:21,981 --> 01:38:23,066
Very good.

1424
01:38:24,359 --> 01:38:27,362
We are calling Dr. Kumagai,
the county coroner.

1425
01:38:27,695 --> 01:38:29,824
There are three depression fractures...

1426
01:38:29,908 --> 01:38:33,537
...like from a heavy, blunt instrument.
Maybe a hammer.

1427
01:38:34,205 --> 01:38:36,208
Here... here... and here.

1428
01:38:38,043 --> 01:38:39,962
This, and this over here, are...

1429
01:38:40,045 --> 01:38:43,550
...sharp, deep penetrations
of the skull and of the brain...

1430
01:38:43,675 --> 01:38:46,928
...like with a hatchet, or maybe
a meat cleaver.

1431
01:38:47,470 --> 01:38:51,725
I call to your attention the results
of the forensic chemist's analysis...

1432
01:38:52,184 --> 01:38:53,769
...State's exhibit 63.

1433
01:38:57,815 --> 01:39:00,486
I think we might just nail this sucker.

1434
01:39:00,695 --> 01:39:05,241
That report states the specimen of semen
taken from Ms. Polhemus's body...

1435
01:39:05,952 --> 01:39:09,789
...has been identified as being
of Mr. Sabich's blood type.

1436
01:39:09,998 --> 01:39:11,332
You are correct.

1437
01:39:11,749 --> 01:39:14,879
It also indicates the presence
of chemicals...

1438
01:39:15,212 --> 01:39:16,547
...consistent...

1439
01:39:16,714 --> 01:39:19,425
...with the use of a birth-control device.

1440
01:39:20,342 --> 01:39:21,636
A diaphragm.

1441
01:39:22,262 --> 01:39:23,346
It does.

1442
01:39:24,932 --> 01:39:27,101
Your opinion is that this was...

1443
01:39:27,518 --> 01:39:28,937
...a staged rape?

1444
01:39:29,021 --> 01:39:30,772
That is my opinion.

1445
01:39:31,607 --> 01:39:33,358
And the way it was done...

1446
01:39:33,525 --> 01:39:34,860
...suggests...

1447
01:39:35,777 --> 01:39:37,363
...the knowledge...

1448
01:39:37,739 --> 01:39:39,991
...of investigative techniques?

1449
01:39:40,992 --> 01:39:43,286
That's what I told Mr. Molto.

1450
01:39:44,456 --> 01:39:46,791
All of these deductions depend...

1451
01:39:47,209 --> 01:39:49,921
...on the presence of spermicidal jelly...

1452
01:39:50,213 --> 01:39:53,467
...in the specimen you sent
to the forensic chemist?

1453
01:39:53,592 --> 01:39:54,801
Yes, sir.

1454
01:39:56,178 --> 01:39:59,641
How many autopsies do you perform
in a week, Dr. Kumagai?

1455
01:40:00,725 --> 01:40:02,018
One, two...

1456
01:40:02,685 --> 01:40:04,395
...ten. It all depends.

1457
01:40:05,021 --> 01:40:08,859
Would it surprise you to know
you performed 18 autopsies...

1458
01:40:09,026 --> 01:40:12,321
...in the two weeks surrounding
Carolyn Polhemus's death?

1459
01:40:12,530 --> 01:40:13,656
No, sir.

1460
01:40:14,616 --> 01:40:16,285
Sounds about right.

1461
01:40:17,328 --> 01:40:20,498
Given that number,
isn't it fair to say that...

1462
01:40:20,957 --> 01:40:24,337
...the specifics of any one examination
may slip your mind?

1463
01:40:26,172 --> 01:40:28,675
I take notes while I do the autopsies.

1464
01:40:29,176 --> 01:40:30,469
Notes, yes.

1465
01:40:32,012 --> 01:40:34,807
These notes led you
to tell Detective Lipranzer...

1466
01:40:34,890 --> 01:40:37,018
...that the murderer was sterile?

1467
01:40:37,519 --> 01:40:40,313
Looking back, you must have thought
you were a fool...

1468
01:40:40,398 --> 01:40:45,028
...to have escaped something so obvious
as the use of a contraceptive spermicide.

1469
01:40:46,363 --> 01:40:48,407
All the sperm were dead.

1470
01:40:49,700 --> 01:40:54,205
I didn't have the forensic chemist's report
about the spermicidal jelly.

1471
01:40:54,372 --> 01:40:58,877
In the absence of any other explanation,
I thought the guy was sterile.

1472
01:41:01,381 --> 01:41:05,051
Do you recognize your notes
of your autopsy of Ms. Polhemus?

1473
01:41:07,598 --> 01:41:09,558
Yes, sir, my signature.

1474
01:41:14,564 --> 01:41:16,608
Unless there is any objection...

1475
01:41:16,691 --> 01:41:20,653
...would you please read the short passage
marked by the paper clips?

1476
01:41:21,738 --> 01:41:23,407
Page two, Counsel.

1477
01:41:24,074 --> 01:41:25,743
Read it out loud, please.

1478
01:41:25,826 --> 01:41:27,828
"The Fallopian tubes...

1479
01:41:28,037 --> 01:41:30,081
"...are ligated and separated.

1480
01:41:30,540 --> 01:41:32,877
"The fimbriated ends appear..."

1481
01:41:46,685 --> 01:41:48,270
That's not right.

1482
01:41:48,604 --> 01:41:50,147
Your own autopsy notes?

1483
01:41:50,231 --> 01:41:53,235
You dictate them
as you perform the procedure.

1484
01:41:58,324 --> 01:41:59,325
But not right.

1485
01:41:59,408 --> 01:42:02,996
I show you the records of Dr. Lubin,
a gynecologist...

1486
01:42:03,372 --> 01:42:07,669
...who performed this procedure
on Ms. Polhemus six and a half years ago.

1487
01:42:10,129 --> 01:42:13,758
Would you explain to the jury
what a "tubal ligation" is?

1488
01:42:19,182 --> 01:42:21,894
Would you explain, in layman's language...

1489
01:42:22,311 --> 01:42:24,314
...what a "tubal ligation" is?

1490
01:42:34,033 --> 01:42:36,035
She had her tubes tied.

1491
01:42:38,372 --> 01:42:42,293
Is it possible for a woman
with this procedure to conceive a child?

1492
01:42:43,711 --> 01:42:44,545
No way.

1493
01:42:44,628 --> 01:42:46,632
Can you think of any reason...

1494
01:42:47,049 --> 01:42:49,760
...for a woman who had her tubes tied...

1495
01:42:50,136 --> 01:42:51,929
...to use a spermicide?

1496
01:42:54,267 --> 01:42:55,643
No reason.

1497
01:42:56,477 --> 01:42:58,146
No medical reason.

1498
01:42:59,689 --> 01:43:00,816
I think of nothing.

1499
01:43:00,900 --> 01:43:03,652
Does it not follow, given these facts...

1500
01:43:03,819 --> 01:43:06,447
...that the specimen you sent
to the chemist...

1501
01:43:06,530 --> 01:43:09,618
...was not taken from the body
of Carolyn Polhemus?

1502
01:43:10,911 --> 01:43:12,914
I can't account for it.

1503
01:43:15,834 --> 01:43:17,920
So you don't know what happened.

1504
01:43:19,922 --> 01:43:23,050
Wherever you got
that specimen from, Doctor...

1505
01:43:24,010 --> 01:43:25,929
...you sent it to the chemist...

1506
01:43:26,012 --> 01:43:29,098
...while you were secretly communicating
with Mr. Molto...

1507
01:43:29,182 --> 01:43:31,186
...behind Mr. Sabich's back. Am I right?

1508
01:43:31,269 --> 01:43:33,521
Do you accuse me, Mr. Stern?

1509
01:43:34,773 --> 01:43:36,358
Sit down, Doctor.

1510
01:43:38,695 --> 01:43:40,572
I think we have had enough...

1511
01:43:40,656 --> 01:43:43,617
...unsupported accusations for one case...

1512
01:43:46,663 --> 01:43:48,206
...Dr. Kumagai.

1513
01:43:49,123 --> 01:43:50,917
You may step down, Doctor.

1514
01:43:51,668 --> 01:43:55,256
Do I take it, Mr. Delay Guardia,
that the State rests?

1515
01:43:59,885 --> 01:44:01,554
Judge, may we approach?

1516
01:44:09,023 --> 01:44:11,401
We would like Mr. Molto to testify.

1517
01:44:11,651 --> 01:44:12,652
No.

1518
01:44:12,735 --> 01:44:15,738
Judge, you said we would be entitled
to some leeway...

1519
01:44:15,822 --> 01:44:18,951
...if the defense proceeded
with this frame-up theory.

1520
01:44:19,034 --> 01:44:21,912
Yes, but I did not know then,
Mr. Della Guardia...

1521
01:44:22,037 --> 01:44:26,751
...that your evidence would disappear
after last being seen with Mr. Molto.

1522
01:44:26,876 --> 01:44:28,838
I didn't know that Mr. Molto...

1523
01:44:28,921 --> 01:44:32,050
...and the chief pathologist
would manufacture evidence...

1524
01:44:32,134 --> 01:44:33,719
...and testimony.

1525
01:44:33,802 --> 01:44:37,848
And I tell you, that is a fair interpretation
of the day's events.

1526
01:44:37,973 --> 01:44:41,311
I'm still considering the question
of what happens to Mr. Molto...

1527
01:44:41,394 --> 01:44:43,062
...but what isn't gonna happen...

1528
01:44:43,146 --> 01:44:46,399
...is him getting up on the witness stand
and making matters worse.

1529
01:44:46,482 --> 01:44:48,320
Withdraw, gentlemen.

1530
01:44:54,118 --> 01:44:57,414
On behalf of the people
of Kindle County, the State rests.

1531
01:44:58,415 --> 01:45:00,208
This court is adjourned.

1532
01:45:00,542 --> 01:45:04,672
You should savor today, Sandy.
No lawyer gets many crosses like that.

1533
01:45:04,839 --> 01:45:06,799
What a colossal blunder.

1534
01:45:08,176 --> 01:45:10,971
Tomorrow I will make the motion
for a dismissal.

1535
01:45:11,055 --> 01:45:15,267
If the dismissal is not granted,
we must proceed with the defense.

1536
01:45:16,978 --> 01:45:20,149
I need to know
if you still insist on testifying.

1537
01:45:21,817 --> 01:45:23,694
Of course, you know my strong objections.

1538
01:45:26,574 --> 01:45:29,160
Why is he so against your testifying?

1539
01:45:29,702 --> 01:45:33,415
He's afraid I'll tell the truth
about my relationship with Carolyn...

1540
01:45:33,499 --> 01:45:37,086
...thus giving the prosecution
the motive they've been lacking.

1541
01:45:38,254 --> 01:45:39,756
One could argue...

1542
01:45:40,882 --> 01:45:44,345
...if the jury feels I'm being truthful
about something so painful...

1543
01:45:44,428 --> 01:45:48,183
...they should believe me when I say
I didn't commit the murder.

1544
01:45:50,102 --> 01:45:51,687
What would you think?

1545
01:45:52,854 --> 01:45:55,024
If I were a member of the jury?

1546
01:45:59,612 --> 01:46:02,450
And I heard you admit
how much she meant to you?

1547
01:46:06,371 --> 01:46:08,791
I think I'd conclude you were guilty.

1548
01:46:13,630 --> 01:46:15,215
I want to testify.

1549
01:46:17,927 --> 01:46:19,554
What would you say?

1550
01:46:24,183 --> 01:46:26,895
I'd say you were the only man I ever loved.

1551
01:46:29,398 --> 01:46:30,899
And I still do.

1552
01:46:33,946 --> 01:46:36,991
Before we begin our presentation,
I would like to...

1553
01:46:37,116 --> 01:46:39,160
Make a motion for dismissal?

1554
01:46:39,619 --> 01:46:40,663
Yes, Your Honor.

1555
01:46:40,747 --> 01:46:42,457
Sit down, Counselor.

1556
01:46:47,378 --> 01:46:51,008
I have reflected on this case at length,
ladies and gentlemen.

1557
01:46:53,093 --> 01:46:54,595
I understand...

1558
01:46:54,803 --> 01:46:57,390
...the prosecutors have suspicions.

1559
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:01,771
Perhaps Mr. Sabich was there that night.

1560
01:47:02,271 --> 01:47:04,483
The State might be granted that.

1561
01:47:04,691 --> 01:47:07,986
And if the prosecutors
had ever found that glass...

1562
01:47:08,612 --> 01:47:10,782
...I might be more convinced.

1563
01:47:11,115 --> 01:47:12,951
Maybe before yesterday...

1564
01:47:13,576 --> 01:47:17,830
...I might have said there were
reasonable grounds for those suspicions.

1565
01:47:17,997 --> 01:47:20,085
But now, I'm not so sure.

1566
01:47:23,129 --> 01:47:24,966
So after yesterday...

1567
01:47:25,633 --> 01:47:28,053
...there is no proof of motive here.

1568
01:47:28,345 --> 01:47:32,975
There is no concrete evidence that
there ever was an intimate relationship.

1569
01:47:33,601 --> 01:47:36,270
There is no effective proof,
so far as I am concerned...

1570
01:47:36,354 --> 01:47:40,149
...that would give a reasonable person
grounds to believe that...

1571
01:47:40,441 --> 01:47:45,406
...Mr. Sabich had carnal relations with
Ms. Polhemus on the night of her death.

1572
01:47:46,282 --> 01:47:47,783
In point of fact...

1573
01:47:47,992 --> 01:47:50,830
...there's not one shred of direct proof...

1574
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:53,958
...that Mr. Sabich murdered Ms. Polhemus.

1575
01:47:56,504 --> 01:47:58,339
Under these circumstances...

1576
01:47:58,423 --> 01:48:00,925
...I cannot allow this trial to continue.

1577
01:48:02,510 --> 01:48:03,762
Mr. Sabich...

1578
01:48:04,930 --> 01:48:06,849
...you are discharged, sir.

1579
01:48:08,809 --> 01:48:11,896
I cannot begin to tell you how sorry I am...

1580
01:48:12,022 --> 01:48:14,357
...that any of this has taken place.

1581
01:48:15,860 --> 01:48:18,697
Not even the pleasure of seeing you free...

1582
01:48:18,864 --> 01:48:20,324
...can make up for this...

1583
01:48:20,407 --> 01:48:23,118
...this disgrace to the cause of justice.

1584
01:48:24,536 --> 01:48:26,372
I wish you Godspeed.

1585
01:48:28,625 --> 01:48:30,168
Case dismissed.

1586
01:48:43,143 --> 01:48:44,686
Hey, Rusty! Come on.

1587
01:48:45,062 --> 01:48:46,855
Give the missus a big hug.

1588
01:48:51,903 --> 01:48:55,031
Nobody can say anything adequate
at a time like this.

1589
01:48:55,114 --> 01:48:57,951
We're very grateful,
very pleased it's all over.

1590
01:48:58,702 --> 01:49:00,287
I want to go home, now.

1591
01:49:00,371 --> 01:49:03,040
I'll talk to Nat. I'll phone him, tell him.

1592
01:49:03,999 --> 01:49:07,296
For the record, I have the highest regard
for Rusty Sabich.

1593
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:09,715
You think you're out of a job?

1594
01:49:12,553 --> 01:49:14,138
You're the very best.

1595
01:49:19,687 --> 01:49:23,023
How'd you know what was behind
Larren's fear of the B file?

1596
01:49:23,899 --> 01:49:26,360
You question the judge's integrity?

1597
01:49:27,195 --> 01:49:29,406
With just cause, wouldn't you say?

1598
01:49:29,864 --> 01:49:33,452
You knew that file didn't have
a damn thing to do with my case.

1599
01:49:33,869 --> 01:49:37,582
Yet you let Larren know you'd drag it in
at any opportunity.

1600
01:49:37,874 --> 01:49:40,335
That it would come out
that he was taking bribes.

1601
01:49:40,419 --> 01:49:42,547
That Carolyn was the courier.

1602
01:49:45,383 --> 01:49:47,218
You blackmailed him, Sandy.

1603
01:49:52,225 --> 01:49:53,893
We speak now tonight...

1604
01:49:55,770 --> 01:49:58,483
...and these things
are never spoken of again.

1605
01:49:59,901 --> 01:50:00,944
Agreed?

1606
01:50:05,074 --> 01:50:08,077
Larren's divorce left him
in a state of disorder.

1607
01:50:09,078 --> 01:50:13,959
He was drinking too heavily and fell
into a relationship with a beautiful, but...

1608
01:50:14,251 --> 01:50:15,919
...self-serving woman.

1609
01:50:17,755 --> 01:50:18,964
The fact is...

1610
01:50:19,048 --> 01:50:22,094
...Larren himself grew suicidally depressed.

1611
01:50:22,970 --> 01:50:25,431
He wanted to resign from the bench.

1612
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:28,102
Raymond Horgan talked him out of it.

1613
01:50:28,436 --> 01:50:30,605
Raymond knew he was taking bribes?

1614
01:50:31,439 --> 01:50:33,107
Larren told him.

1615
01:50:35,110 --> 01:50:38,447
Raymond cleaned up the Northside,
as you recall...

1616
01:50:39,490 --> 01:50:42,326
...and he also rescued
a distinguished mind...

1617
01:50:42,493 --> 01:50:45,288
...and a career that does honor
to the bench.

1618
01:50:50,337 --> 01:50:53,799
I believe Larren today did
what he thought was just.

1619
01:50:56,301 --> 01:50:57,970
You tell me, Rusty.

1620
01:50:59,681 --> 01:51:01,349
Was justice done?

1621
01:51:11,027 --> 01:51:12,530
How are you doing?

1622
01:51:21,541 --> 01:51:23,126
Christmas present.

1623
01:51:37,351 --> 01:51:38,477
Jesus...

1624
01:51:41,397 --> 01:51:44,569
You're hanging your ass out
a good long way on this one.

1625
01:51:45,069 --> 01:51:47,071
It was them that fucked up.

1626
01:51:47,822 --> 01:51:51,160
Remember, they came around,
they grabbed all the evidence.

1627
01:51:51,493 --> 01:51:54,496
The glass wasn't there.
I took it down to Dickerman.

1628
01:51:55,456 --> 01:51:58,000
The very next day I get a call from the lab.

1629
01:51:58,083 --> 01:52:00,754
The test is done. I can pick up my glass.

1630
01:52:01,838 --> 01:52:06,428
When I went down there, Molto had signed
a receipt, "Returned to Evidence."

1631
01:52:07,012 --> 01:52:09,765
The idea was that I'll put it back in.

1632
01:52:10,515 --> 01:52:12,893
Only I got nowhere to put it...

1633
01:52:13,435 --> 01:52:16,189
...since it ain't my goddamn case anymore.

1634
01:52:18,024 --> 01:52:20,276
So I tossed the thing in my drawer.

1635
01:52:20,943 --> 01:52:24,032
I figured, sooner or later
somebody's got to ask me.

1636
01:52:25,450 --> 01:52:26,701
Nobody did.

1637
01:52:27,703 --> 01:52:29,373
You think I killed her.

1638
01:52:32,459 --> 01:52:34,211
The lady was bad news.

1639
01:52:38,883 --> 01:52:40,968
That makes it okay I killed her?

1640
01:52:41,052 --> 01:52:42,345
Did you?

1641
01:52:44,932 --> 01:52:46,058
Oh, pal.

1642
01:53:09,503 --> 01:53:10,379
Nat!

1643
01:53:11,505 --> 01:53:12,840
Where's Mom?

1644
01:53:13,007 --> 01:53:15,593
Upstairs in the bathroom
throwing up when I saw her.

1645
01:53:15,677 --> 01:53:18,014
She's got her university interview today.

1646
01:53:18,097 --> 01:53:19,432
What's the big deal?

1647
01:53:19,515 --> 01:53:21,183
No eggs for me, thank you.

1648
01:53:21,267 --> 01:53:22,602
That looks nice.

1649
01:53:22,686 --> 01:53:23,854
You think?

1650
01:53:24,187 --> 01:53:27,691
That dumb old college would be lucky
to have you teaching there.

1651
01:53:27,774 --> 01:53:29,192
You tell her, kid.

1652
01:53:30,111 --> 01:53:33,322
I'll do some work around the house
while I still have time.

1653
01:53:33,406 --> 01:53:35,033
I've lived to see the day.

1654
01:53:35,116 --> 01:53:37,620
Give me a hand with the fence
when you get home.

1655
01:53:37,704 --> 01:53:39,539
I can't. I got a game after school.

1656
01:53:39,622 --> 01:53:40,915
Good luck, Mom.

1657
01:53:50,052 --> 01:53:51,470
Go get them, kid.

1658
01:55:54,868 --> 01:55:56,203
I did it.

1659
01:56:02,919 --> 01:56:04,670
I fooled them all.

1660
01:56:07,882 --> 01:56:09,260
The interview.

1661
01:56:10,512 --> 01:56:12,597
They think I'm qualified.

1662
01:57:19,093 --> 01:57:21,763
You understand what happened
had to happen.

1663
01:57:23,890 --> 01:57:26,436
It couldn't have turned out any other way.

1664
01:57:29,397 --> 01:57:31,317
A woman's depressed...

1665
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:34,780
...with herself...

1666
01:57:35,947 --> 01:57:37,365
...with life...

1667
01:57:39,117 --> 01:57:42,955
...with her husband, who had made life
possible for her until he was...

1668
01:57:43,039 --> 01:57:45,333
...bewitched by another woman.

1669
01:57:47,127 --> 01:57:48,587
A destroyer.

1670
01:57:53,717 --> 01:57:55,178
Abandoned...

1671
01:57:58,390 --> 01:58:00,559
...like someone left for dead...

1672
01:58:02,313 --> 01:58:04,399
...she plans her suicide.

1673
01:58:07,985 --> 01:58:09,988
Until the dream begins.

1674
01:58:12,032 --> 01:58:14,827
In the dream, the destroyer's destroyed.

1675
01:58:16,245 --> 01:58:18,415
That's a dream worth living for.

1676
01:58:23,421 --> 01:58:25,465
Now, with such simplicity...

1677
01:58:29,261 --> 01:58:32,390
...such clarity, everything falls into place.

1678
01:58:36,018 --> 01:58:37,895
It must be a crime...

1679
01:58:38,312 --> 01:58:42,777
...that her husband can declare unsolved
and be believed by all the world.

1680
01:58:43,820 --> 01:58:46,197
She must make it look like a rape.

1681
01:58:47,826 --> 01:58:50,537
But she must leave her husband clueless.

1682
01:58:51,037 --> 01:58:53,415
Once he discovers who it was...

1683
01:58:54,833 --> 01:58:58,296
...he'll put the case into the file
of the unsolved murders.

1684
01:59:00,089 --> 01:59:02,091
Another break-in by some...

1685
01:59:02,634 --> 01:59:04,303
...sex-crazed man.

1686
01:59:09,433 --> 01:59:10,977
But all his life...

1687
01:59:12,605 --> 01:59:14,732
...he'll know that it was her.

1688
01:59:19,697 --> 01:59:22,575
She remembers a set of glasses
she bought for the woman...

1689
01:59:22,658 --> 01:59:27,289
...some time before, a housewarming gift
from her husband and his office.

1690
01:59:27,790 --> 01:59:29,583
She buys another set.

1691
01:59:30,918 --> 01:59:33,505
Her husband has a beer one night...

1692
01:59:35,799 --> 01:59:38,135
...doesn't even comment on the glass.

1693
01:59:39,303 --> 01:59:41,264
Now she has his fingerprints.

1694
01:59:45,811 --> 01:59:47,896
Then on a few mornings...

1695
01:59:49,440 --> 01:59:53,528
...she saves the fluid that comes out
when she removes her diaphragm.

1696
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:02,123
Puts it in a plastic bag.

1697
02:00:03,667 --> 02:00:06,086
Puts the bag in the basement freezer...

1698
02:00:07,337 --> 02:00:08,630
...and waits.

1699
02:00:11,551 --> 02:00:14,220
She calls the woman and asks to see her.

1700
02:00:15,012 --> 02:00:18,099
Stops first at the U
and logs onto the computer.

1701
02:00:18,392 --> 02:00:20,310
Now she has her alibi.

1702
02:00:22,813 --> 02:00:24,731
She goes to the woman.

1703
02:00:25,649 --> 02:00:27,570
The woman lets her in.

1704
02:00:28,654 --> 02:00:33,242
When her head is turned, she removes
the instrument from her bag and strikes.

1705
02:00:35,830 --> 02:00:37,748
The destroyer is destroyed.

1706
02:00:41,378 --> 02:00:43,380
She takes a cord out...

1707
02:00:45,382 --> 02:00:47,426
...that she brought along...

1708
02:00:49,637 --> 02:00:51,431
...and ties her body...

1709
02:00:52,015 --> 02:00:55,019
...in ways her husband described
perverts do.

1710
02:00:58,106 --> 02:00:59,858
She feels power...

1711
02:01:01,860 --> 02:01:03,278
...control...

1712
02:01:05,198 --> 02:01:08,576
...a sense that she's guided
by a force beyond herself.

1713
02:01:11,664 --> 02:01:15,627
Takes a syringe and injects
the contents of the Ziploc bag...

1714
02:01:17,337 --> 02:01:19,508
...leaves the glass on the bar...

1715
02:01:20,592 --> 02:01:23,011
...unlocks the door and windows...

1716
02:01:25,388 --> 02:01:26,808
...and goes home.

1717
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:32,939
And life begins again.

1718
02:01:39,696 --> 02:01:41,198
Until a trial...

1719
02:01:44,328 --> 02:01:46,705
...when she sees her husband suffer...

1720
02:01:48,040 --> 02:01:49,710
...the way she never...

1721
02:01:50,795 --> 02:01:52,088
...intended.

1722
02:01:54,882 --> 02:01:57,052
She is prepared to tell the truth.

1723
02:01:58,345 --> 02:02:00,180
Right up to the very end.

1724
02:02:03,851 --> 02:02:05,186
But magically...

1725
02:02:07,981 --> 02:02:09,984
...the charges were dismissed.

1726
02:02:13,488 --> 02:02:15,323
The suffering was over.

1727
02:02:18,201 --> 02:02:19,745
They were saved.

1728
02:02:26,252 --> 02:02:27,380
Saved?

1729
02:02:36,892 --> 02:02:39,311
The murder of Carolyn Polhemus...

1730
02:02:39,936 --> 02:02:41,771
...remains unsolved.

1731
02:02:44,025 --> 02:02:48,446
It is a practical impossibility
to try two people for the same crime.

1732
02:02:50,783 --> 02:02:52,618
Even if it wasn't...

1733
02:02:53,994 --> 02:02:56,914
...I couldn't take his mother from my son.

1734
02:02:59,502 --> 02:03:01,212
I'm a prosecutor.

1735
02:03:01,587 --> 02:03:04,840
I have spent my life
in the assignment of blame.

1736
02:03:07,011 --> 02:03:09,597
With all deliberation and intent...

1737
02:03:10,306 --> 02:03:12,391
...I reached for Carolyn.

1738
02:03:13,101 --> 02:03:15,354
I cannot pretend it was an accident.

1739
02:03:17,564 --> 02:03:19,024
I reached for Carolyn...

1740
02:03:19,107 --> 02:03:22,570
...and set off that insane mix
of rage and lunacy...

1741
02:03:24,657 --> 02:03:27,284
...that led one human being to kill another.

1742
02:03:30,372 --> 02:03:31,790
There was a crime.

1743
02:03:33,834 --> 02:03:35,461
There was a victim.

1744
02:03:37,964 --> 02:03:39,799
And there is punishment.

1745
