1
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:19,354
Rescue 3.
Jessie, do you see him yet?

2
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,274
Patience, my love, patience.

3
00:02:26,194 --> 00:02:28,488
Wait a minute.
I think I have him sighted.

4
00:02:28,572 --> 00:02:30,407
Frank, what's the word?

5
00:02:31,491 --> 00:02:33,452
The word is we got him
over there.

6
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:40,250
Rescue 3, this is Rescue Center.
Over.

7
00:02:40,333 --> 00:02:41,877
This is 3. Go ahead.

8
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,213
Jessie, we're getting general clearance
in the southeastern region of the park.

9
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:49,009
You will probably have sufficient
cloud base to get into the tower...

10
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:52,763
but please be advised you'll still
encounter strong winds and turbulence.

11
00:02:52,804 --> 00:02:55,723
We would advise
against a winch rescue. Over.

12
00:02:55,806 --> 00:02:59,226
Wilco, Center. I'll proceed
with wire cross from opposite tower.

13
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,771
- Three out.
- Center out.

14
00:03:16,702 --> 00:03:20,039
Gabe, Hal's signaling he's okay.

15
00:03:21,665 --> 00:03:22,875
Gabe?

16
00:03:24,376 --> 00:03:26,170
Gabe, where are you?

17
00:03:26,253 --> 00:03:28,255
I'm just hanging out, Jess.

18
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:30,882
Oh, my God.

19
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,723
I don't recognize the face,
but the butt does look vaguely familiar.

20
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:42,477
Hey, be careful,
or you'll embarrass old Frank.

21
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:44,979
It would take a heap more
than that, rock-jock.

22
00:03:45,063 --> 00:03:46,606
Yeah.

23
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:26,895
Gabe?

24
00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:29,231
They're below
the top of the tower.

25
00:04:29,314 --> 00:04:31,316
They're on the ledge
just above you.

26
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,402
You got another few feet.

27
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:42,618
- Glad you could join us.
- Yeah, sure. Hi, Sarah.

28
00:04:42,702 --> 00:04:44,036
Hi, Gabe.

29
00:04:44,078 --> 00:04:46,664
So, how's the knee?

30
00:04:46,747 --> 00:04:49,167
I think it's out.
No big deal.

31
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,879
I remember when you twisted it
getting out of that hot tub.

32
00:04:53,796 --> 00:04:56,382
I thought it was
an old war wound from 'Nam.

33
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:58,426
Really? Hmm.

34
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,887
Rescue 3.

35
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,389
I've located a stranded climber.

36
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:06,225
Jessie, please send down
a transport line.

37
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:18,695
So, tell me, how you feeling?

38
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:21,072
Fine, considering.

39
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:23,408
What do you say we take off...

40
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:26,828
and leave this clown behind, huh?

41
00:05:26,912 --> 00:05:28,121
Don't tempt me.

42
00:05:35,128 --> 00:05:36,421
Rescue 3.

43
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:38,840
Please be advised
that Ranger Walker...

44
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:41,093
is making advances
toward my girlfriend...

45
00:05:41,134 --> 00:05:44,721
that's liable to get his ass kicked
right off this mountain.

46
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:46,973
Be informed Gabe makes advances
to me only...

47
00:05:47,057 --> 00:05:49,935
or he'll be climbing down
4,000 feet and sleeping outside.

48
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:52,478
Baby, he lies.

49
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:28,555
- Is it really 4,000?
- Yeah, just about.

50
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:33,059
Hey, remember, whatever this guy says
about me, don't believe it, okay?

51
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,394
Thanks.

52
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:48,491
Okay. Come on over.

53
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:56,458
I know you're nervous, but
we've done this a hundred times, okay?

54
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,001
Mm-hmm.

55
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,506
Excuse me, Captain Hot Tub?

56
00:07:06,049 --> 00:07:08,677
Keep your arms and legs
inside the vehicle at all times.

57
00:07:11,388 --> 00:07:12,848
That's great, Hal.

58
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,351
That really inspires confidence.

59
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:26,570
So, how did this clown talk you
into climbing up to the tower?

60
00:07:26,653 --> 00:07:28,947
He told me
it was better than sex.

61
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:30,616
Really?

62
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:35,537
You ready for the best ride
in the park?

63
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:38,623
Give me a second.
I'll let you know.

64
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,512
You look like hell.

65
00:07:52,595 --> 00:07:53,888
He made it.

66
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:55,890
Of course he did.

67
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:58,059
Really, there's nothing to it.

68
00:07:58,142 --> 00:07:59,936
Okay, I can do this.

69
00:08:00,019 --> 00:08:01,479
Sure you can.

70
00:08:01,562 --> 00:08:03,815
I'm sorry
for all the trouble, really.

71
00:08:03,898 --> 00:08:06,359
- Oh, Sarah, don't worry about it.
- Thanks.

72
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,236
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, yeah.

73
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:14,407
- We're still on for dinner tonight?
- Of course we are.

74
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:15,909
Okay.

75
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:19,162
Okay. You're ready now.

76
00:08:19,246 --> 00:08:20,497
That's it.

77
00:08:23,834 --> 00:08:26,086
Now, just sit
right down into it.

78
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:30,424
Come on, guys.
The wind's picking up.

79
00:08:32,092 --> 00:08:34,386
Sarah, just keep
your eyes on me.

80
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:35,887
No, don't look... Sarah.

81
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:38,515
Sarah, look at me.
That's it.

82
00:08:38,598 --> 00:08:41,643
- Right.
- Just start to pull.

83
00:08:41,726 --> 00:08:43,603
One hand after another.

84
00:08:43,645 --> 00:08:47,107
You're doing great...
really, great. Keep goin'.

85
00:08:48,024 --> 00:08:50,943
And just keep looking at me.

86
00:08:51,026 --> 00:08:53,571
That's great!
You're starting to look like a pro.

87
00:08:53,654 --> 00:08:55,406
Keep going.

88
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:57,324
That's it.
Nice and easy.

89
00:08:57,408 --> 00:09:00,619
Hey, Hal, we're gonna
be out of a job soon.

90
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:02,204
A little more, Sarah.

91
00:09:02,288 --> 00:09:03,789
That's it.

92
00:09:04,957 --> 00:09:06,792
One, two.

93
00:09:11,964 --> 00:09:13,382
Oh, God!

94
00:09:13,466 --> 00:09:15,301
Gabe! Gabe!

95
00:09:15,342 --> 00:09:17,344
No!

96
00:09:17,386 --> 00:09:18,888
Hold on!

97
00:09:20,055 --> 00:09:23,058
- I'm going to fall!
- No, you're not!

98
00:09:23,142 --> 00:09:24,976
You're going to be okay!

99
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:29,481
- Can you reach the main line?
- No, I can't! I'm slipping!

100
00:09:29,522 --> 00:09:32,817
- Gabe, can you keep the line steady?
- That clip's not gonna hold!

101
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:35,862
I can't hold on!
Help me, please!

102
00:09:35,904 --> 00:09:38,573
- Gabe, you have to go after her.
- No!

103
00:09:38,656 --> 00:09:41,493
- Gabe, no!
- I'm coming out to get you!

104
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:45,371
It's not rigged for two. Keep it from
swinging. I'll send out my harness.

105
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:47,415
No time!
I'm going for her!

106
00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:50,460
Gabe, shit! No!

107
00:09:50,543 --> 00:09:52,212
Sarah, I'm coming for you!

108
00:09:52,295 --> 00:09:54,214
I can't hold on! I'm slipping!

109
00:09:54,297 --> 00:09:57,050
Hold on just a little bit longer!
I'm coming for you!

110
00:09:57,133 --> 00:10:00,344
Gabe, please hurry!
I can't hold on!

111
00:10:00,427 --> 00:10:02,805
Don't look down.
Keep looking at me.

112
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:05,724
- That's it. Hold it.
- I'm trying!

113
00:10:07,226 --> 00:10:09,478
It's breaking.
She's losing it.

114
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:13,649
Sarah! He'll have you
in a second, baby!

115
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:16,193
Come on, baby!
Don't you give up!

116
00:10:18,028 --> 00:10:20,364
Hurry, Gabe.
You're almost there.

117
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:22,783
- Keep going.
- I'm here, Sarah.

118
00:10:22,866 --> 00:10:24,618
Sarah, I'm here.

119
00:10:25,577 --> 00:10:27,496
I don't want to die!

120
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:30,833
Reach up and grab him!
Reach up!

121
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,460
- Sarah, reach up!
- Come on, honey!

122
00:10:33,544 --> 00:10:35,378
- Use your other hand!
- Reach up!

123
00:10:40,758 --> 00:10:43,803
Hold on! Hold on!
I got you! I got you.

124
00:10:43,886 --> 00:10:46,806
I can't hold on!
I'm going to die!

125
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:49,225
You're not going to die.

126
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:52,812
Don't you lose her, Gabe.

127
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:54,564
I got her. Reach up.

128
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:57,066
I'm slipping. I'm slipping!

129
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:01,404
- You can do it, Sarah.
- Hold her, Gabe!

130
00:11:01,446 --> 00:11:03,239
Please don't let me tall.

131
00:11:03,281 --> 00:11:05,491
Please, I don't want to die.

132
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:07,452
- You're not gonna die.
- I'm slipping!

133
00:11:07,535 --> 00:11:09,704
Sarah, I got you!
Just reach up!

134
00:11:09,787 --> 00:11:11,913
I can't, Gabe!

135
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:14,374
You can do it.
Please, baby, just reach up!

136
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:17,252
Hal! Hal! I'm slipping!

137
00:11:17,294 --> 00:11:19,588
Gabe, man, don't you lose her!

138
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:22,132
- Don't you let her go!
- Don't let me tall.

139
00:11:24,134 --> 00:11:26,428
I'm slipping!

140
00:11:26,511 --> 00:11:28,013
Sarah, please.

141
00:11:28,096 --> 00:11:30,015
No, I'm slipping! Gabe!

142
00:11:30,098 --> 00:11:32,017
Gabe, don't let me tall!

143
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,437
- No!
- Help me! I'm falling! Gabe!

144
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:48,783
No! Sarah, no!

145
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,295
Jesus Christ.

146
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,194
Treasury Agent Mac Lamoore,
please contact D. A. U.

147
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:38,248
Lock 'em up.

148
00:12:39,707 --> 00:12:42,669
Travers, we'll be fueled up
and ready to go in ten minutes.

149
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,921
Very good.

150
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:52,762
Mr. Travers.

151
00:12:55,598 --> 00:12:56,933
- Hey, Rich.
- Morning, Walt.

152
00:12:57,016 --> 00:12:59,017
This is Agent Matheson, F. B. I.

153
00:12:59,101 --> 00:13:00,185
Travers.

154
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:03,522
Matheson has been transferred
from the Denver office to Frisco.

155
00:13:03,564 --> 00:13:07,693
As a professional courtesy
I was asked if he could hitch a ride.

156
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:10,237
Got plenty of room.
Be glad to accommodate you.

157
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,281
- Appreciate it.
- You're the boss.

158
00:13:12,364 --> 00:13:15,033
Let's go. Matheson,
have you been totally briefed?

159
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:18,370
- I don't know about totally.
- Who the hell ever is?

160
00:13:18,412 --> 00:13:21,248
It's the most protected shipment
we've got and the most useless.

161
00:13:21,331 --> 00:13:23,333
These bills aren't even
in circulation.

162
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:26,545
$1,000 bills we're transporting are only
used for international banking exchange.

163
00:13:26,628 --> 00:13:28,380
You always transport
through the air?

164
00:13:28,422 --> 00:13:31,049
Mostly. Armored cars can be hijacked,
trains derailed...

165
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:33,301
but nobody can touch us in flight.

166
00:13:33,384 --> 00:13:36,053
Haven't lost a bill in 12 years.
Don't jinx me now.

167
00:13:36,137 --> 00:13:40,141
Treasury agents are the most
superstitious people in the government.

168
00:13:40,224 --> 00:13:42,727
We should be.
Everybody wants what we have.

169
00:14:01,245 --> 00:14:03,247
Gabe! Hey, man, Gabe!

170
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:05,583
- It's Gabe. He's back!
- I can see that.

171
00:14:07,043 --> 00:14:09,086
Come on, man. Let's go!

172
00:14:30,023 --> 00:14:31,525
How you doing, Gabe?

173
00:14:31,608 --> 00:14:33,610
Dude, turn that down.

174
00:14:33,693 --> 00:14:36,279
You guys.
How you doing, Brett, Evan?

175
00:14:36,363 --> 00:14:39,324
Where you been?
You fall off the planet or something?

176
00:14:39,408 --> 00:14:42,744
- No, I've been working up in Denver.
- Work?

177
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:44,286
Don't say that word.

178
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:47,039
I hate work, even when
somebody else is doing it.

179
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:51,752
Gabe, we're flying off the tower today.
You should come with us.

180
00:14:51,836 --> 00:14:54,463
Today's going to be the day
for a killer jump.

181
00:14:56,882 --> 00:14:58,884
- No, thanks. Can't.
- Come on, man.

182
00:14:58,968 --> 00:15:02,346
Don't tell me that job in Denver
made you scared of heights?

183
00:15:06,016 --> 00:15:09,728
You guys better watch out 'cause
some bad weather's comin' in, okay?

184
00:15:09,812 --> 00:15:12,064
We like it extreme.

185
00:15:13,357 --> 00:15:16,569
Hey, man, see you later, Gabe.
Good to have you back.

186
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:18,654
Yeah, good to see you. Later.

187
00:15:18,738 --> 00:15:20,321
Peace.

188
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:39,174
How you doing, Jess?

189
00:15:45,054 --> 00:15:46,639
Hello, Gabriel.

190
00:15:49,684 --> 00:15:51,603
Got yourself a new horse?

191
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:57,649
- Where have you been?
- Just working.

192
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:01,862
After the funeral,
I just had to leave.

193
00:16:01,904 --> 00:16:04,031
Had to leave?

194
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:07,618
Believe me, a lot of us
wanted to leave.

195
00:16:07,701 --> 00:16:09,078
But you know what?

196
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:11,080
We stayed.

197
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:15,542
Jess...

198
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:18,879
a lot of things fell apart
on that ledge.

199
00:16:18,962 --> 00:16:20,547
I know.

200
00:16:20,631 --> 00:16:23,550
But I don't think
you know how much.

201
00:16:23,592 --> 00:16:26,386
Why can't you just believe
you did everything you could?

202
00:16:26,428 --> 00:16:28,931
Did I? I don't know.

203
00:16:29,014 --> 00:16:31,224
Maybe I shouldn't have
gone out on that line.

204
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:35,561
Maybe I panicked.
I don't know.

205
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:37,730
I was there, remember?

206
00:16:37,814 --> 00:16:40,108
You were the only one
who didn't panic.

207
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,820
Why don't you do us a favor
and quit hording all the guilt?

208
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:47,865
You held on as long as you could.
And what about Hal?

209
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:51,744
What was Hal doing on the tower
with a girl who could barely climb?

210
00:16:51,786 --> 00:16:54,580
I can't blame Hal for anything.
It was me.

211
00:16:55,873 --> 00:16:57,291
All me.

212
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,877
Well, give it up, Gabe...

213
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:02,505
because let me tell you something...
it doesn't get any better.

214
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,258
It doesn't get any better?

215
00:17:07,592 --> 00:17:10,429
I really don't think
you understand.

216
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,932
- What?
- I don't think you understand.

217
00:17:13,974 --> 00:17:15,934
I don't understand?

218
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,230
I think I'm the only one
that understands.

219
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:25,569
Believe me, there were times when I
didn't know what I wanted to do more...

220
00:17:25,652 --> 00:17:28,280
hate you or love you.

221
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:32,451
But one thing I did know
and I still do know...

222
00:17:32,534 --> 00:17:34,786
is I understand you.

223
00:17:47,965 --> 00:17:50,217
Did you come back to stay?

224
00:17:56,348 --> 00:17:57,933
You didn't.

225
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:02,563
I can't.

226
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:05,983
I can't. Not here.

227
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,321
Jessie, I came back for you.

228
00:18:10,404 --> 00:18:14,116
And it you like,
I want you to come with me.

229
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:22,665
You come back after being gone for
almost a year and expect me to leave?

230
00:18:24,793 --> 00:18:26,961
This is our home.

231
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:30,173
Now it's my home.

232
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:34,010
And I can't just pick up and go
for all the wrong reasons.

233
00:18:43,394 --> 00:18:46,856
If you don't mind, I'd better
pick up the rest of my stuff.

234
00:18:46,898 --> 00:18:49,567
You know where everything is.

235
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:51,861
I'm late for work.

236
00:19:07,042 --> 00:19:08,627
Hey, big boy.

237
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,015
Roger, Five-Lima,
scattered, broken clouds...

238
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,351
20,000 feet with
a severe storm advisory.

239
00:19:24,435 --> 00:19:26,562
Check the storm scope.

240
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,751
Travers says
you're being transferred.

241
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:51,836
Oh, yeah.
Moving up in the world.

242
00:20:07,934 --> 00:20:10,771
The forecast... cloudy skies
with flurries today.

243
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:14,066
We can expect an inch of snow
and a high in the low 30s.

244
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:18,070
Overnight flurries will increase with
a total accumulation of three inches.

245
00:20:18,153 --> 00:20:19,988
Tonight's low near 15.

246
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:22,866
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time
for another masterpiece.

247
00:20:22,949 --> 00:20:24,409
Hiya, Jess.

248
00:20:24,493 --> 00:20:27,954
Oh, I think old Frank
nailed it with that stroke.

249
00:20:27,996 --> 00:20:29,831
What do you think?

250
00:20:29,915 --> 00:20:32,000
I don't know.

251
00:20:32,084 --> 00:20:34,086
What do you see?

252
00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:35,462
Surprise me.

253
00:20:35,504 --> 00:20:37,964
What usually eats a banana?

254
00:20:38,048 --> 00:20:39,799
A monkey.

255
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,468
This is a picture
of a banana eating a monkey.

256
00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:45,054
- Nature in reverse.
- Where?

257
00:20:46,347 --> 00:20:47,723
Right here.

258
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:53,312
Frank, you look like
a normal guy, but he's not...

259
00:20:53,354 --> 00:20:55,064
are you, Frankie?

260
00:20:55,147 --> 00:20:56,899
Hey, I'm an artist.

261
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:11,997
We're being tracked.

262
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:14,290
- Jetstar, three o'clock.
- Travers!

263
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:17,460
Stay put. Don't anyone
jump to conclusions.

264
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:25,552
- He's coming in too slow.
- No, we're going too fast.

265
00:21:25,635 --> 00:21:28,763
We're too high. Give me 180 knots,
drop to 15,000 feet.

266
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:30,682
You got it.

267
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:34,519
Christ. We're losing altitude
and slowing down. Get your weapons.

268
00:21:34,602 --> 00:21:37,439
What the hell are you doing?
I have jurisdiction on this jet.

269
00:21:38,982 --> 00:21:42,193
Now I have jurisdiction.
I said get your weapons!

270
00:21:42,277 --> 00:21:45,155
These are highly trained agents,
Mr. Matheson.

271
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:49,159
I think you're overreacting.
Just calm down and give me the gun.

272
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:52,035
- You're out of control.
- What the hell are you waiting for?

273
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:54,371
He's hijacking the shipment.

274
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,518
What the fuck was that?

275
00:22:29,822 --> 00:22:31,574
- Move into position.
- Look alive, Kristel.

276
00:22:31,657 --> 00:22:33,993
Crossover transfer,
ten seconds and counting.

277
00:22:34,077 --> 00:22:35,912
November 1-2-niner-five Lima...

278
00:22:35,995 --> 00:22:38,372
this is Jetstar
6-8-0 Tango-Tango.

279
00:22:38,456 --> 00:22:41,084
Is frequency secure? Over.

280
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:43,920
Roger, Tango-Tango.
This is Five-Lima. Go ahead.

281
00:22:44,003 --> 00:22:47,924
We have visual contact. What is
your heading, speed and level? Over.

282
00:22:48,007 --> 00:22:51,385
We're heading 0-8-0
and doing 2-5-0 knots level...

283
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:53,930
at flight level 2-1-0-niner.

284
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:55,932
Five-Lima, we're opening up.

285
00:22:55,973 --> 00:22:57,975
Rise and shine, gentlemen.
Let's make history.

286
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:00,560
Roger, Five-Lima.
We'll begin closing.

287
00:23:00,644 --> 00:23:02,687
Bring your speed back to 1-5-0.

288
00:23:02,771 --> 00:23:07,609
Commence descent to flight level 1-4-0
and turn right onto 2-6-0. Over.

289
00:23:09,653 --> 00:23:13,573
We're level. Flight level 1-4-0
and steady, 2-6-0 degrees.

290
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:15,575
The weather ahead
looks a bit threatening.

291
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:17,619
Roger.

292
00:23:17,702 --> 00:23:20,455
- Travers, report your position.
- Ready to disengage tail cone.

293
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:22,082
Stand by.

294
00:23:28,547 --> 00:23:31,466
- Tail cone's clear.
- Roger.

295
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:49,483
Phase one complete.

296
00:23:50,526 --> 00:23:52,403
Tango-Tango,
prepare to receive cable.

297
00:23:52,486 --> 00:23:55,614
Tango-Tango standing by.

298
00:23:55,698 --> 00:23:57,616
Tango-Tango,
what's the turbulence back there?

299
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:02,037
She's all over the place. This thing's
got the response of a 747 at this speed.

300
00:24:02,121 --> 00:24:05,833
Sounds like fun. We're streaming the
drogue down. We'll see you in a minute.

301
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:08,461
Welcoming party's ready.
Good luck.

302
00:24:08,544 --> 00:24:12,130
We're moving in to pick up
the drogue now. Tango-Tango out.

303
00:24:18,636 --> 00:24:20,430
I've got it.
Stand by, Kristel.

304
00:24:20,513 --> 00:24:22,432
Standing by.

305
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:26,686
We're locked on.

306
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:28,855
Into the transfer position.

307
00:24:28,938 --> 00:24:30,148
Check.

308
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,609
Moving into transfer position.

309
00:24:32,692 --> 00:24:35,236
We're closing to 1-4-0 feet.

310
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,199
We're closing.
We'll report when in position.

311
00:24:41,826 --> 00:24:45,163
- We're too close to the storm.
- Don't lose your nerve.

312
00:24:45,205 --> 00:24:48,207
All they'll find is a plane
that went down in the storm.

313
00:24:48,248 --> 00:24:51,251
- Hurry up, Travers.
- On my way.

314
00:24:51,335 --> 00:24:53,587
The cases are hooked up
and ready.

315
00:24:55,714 --> 00:24:59,426
Charge goes off in five minutes.
Stick to the plan and you're rich.

316
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,720
Got it.

317
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:04,390
Tango-Tango in position.

318
00:25:04,473 --> 00:25:06,725
- What's taking so long?
- Patience.

319
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:12,481
Tango-Tango, dip the plane.
I'm coming over.

320
00:25:12,564 --> 00:25:15,401
Wilco, Five-Lima.
Tango-Tango standing by...

321
00:25:15,442 --> 00:25:17,986
at flight level 1-4-0
and steady 2-6-0 degrees.

322
00:25:21,198 --> 00:25:23,324
Five-Lima, I'm out of here.

323
00:25:23,408 --> 00:25:24,826
Roger.

324
00:25:28,621 --> 00:25:31,124
What the hell is he doing?

325
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:35,086
Five-Lima, where are the cases?

326
00:25:43,553 --> 00:25:45,638
- Kristel, we've got him.
- Roger.

327
00:25:45,722 --> 00:25:48,015
Why didn't you send
the money first?

328
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:52,061
Somehow, I didn't think
you'd wait for me if I sent it first.

329
00:26:12,873 --> 00:26:16,042
We're approaching the storm fast.
I can't hold this course much longer.

330
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:19,212
- 9-0 seconds.
- What's keeping him?

331
00:26:20,297 --> 00:26:22,466
Let's move your ass up there.

332
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:26,303
I'm at the cases.
Stand by.

333
00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:28,305
Tango-Tango standing by.

334
00:26:28,388 --> 00:26:29,806
You fuck.

335
00:26:37,772 --> 00:26:39,356
We've lost the pilot.

336
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,358
- Who did you leave up there?
- No one.

337
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:50,701
Get underneath the jet.
The cases will slide over.

338
00:26:55,206 --> 00:26:57,291
Who the fuck is our guest?

339
00:27:07,676 --> 00:27:10,428
Just get those cases.

340
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:12,472
He's hurt bad.
What should we do with him?

341
00:27:12,555 --> 00:27:15,600
Get him to a hospital, fast.

342
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:23,149
- We're not leveling out.
- 1-0 seconds.

343
00:27:23,233 --> 00:27:25,151
I've lost hydraulics!

344
00:27:41,251 --> 00:27:43,086
The cable's blown tree.

345
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:45,587
Don't unhook it.
The cases are still there.

346
00:27:45,671 --> 00:27:48,048
- Don't lose the money, goddamn it!
- Hold it.

347
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,551
- Pull the cable!
- We gotta pull!

348
00:27:50,592 --> 00:27:52,636
- Bypass switch one.
- Check.

349
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,763
- Bypass switch two.
- Keep pulling.

350
00:27:54,847 --> 00:27:56,890
- Nothing.
- Switch to manual.

351
00:27:56,974 --> 00:27:58,892
Hold the fuckin ' plane steady!

352
00:27:58,934 --> 00:28:02,479
- Pull! Come on!
- Travers, don't fuck it up!

353
00:28:02,563 --> 00:28:04,857
- How's number one engine?
- Oil pressure falling.

354
00:28:04,898 --> 00:28:08,318
- Come on. Don't lose the money.
- They're coming.

355
00:28:08,402 --> 00:28:10,195
Goddamn it! Shit!

356
00:28:11,905 --> 00:28:14,575
- We've lost it.
- Oh, fuck!

357
00:28:16,285 --> 00:28:17,870
Release the cable.

358
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:22,665
Close it up.

359
00:28:26,085 --> 00:28:29,047
So this is your idea
of a foolproof plan?

360
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,425
You stupid bastard.
Kristel, what's the report?

361
00:28:32,508 --> 00:28:35,553
The hydraulics aren't functioning.
He shot them out.

362
00:28:35,595 --> 00:28:37,138
Fire warning, line tour.

363
00:28:37,221 --> 00:28:39,432
I'm losing altitude.
We're gonna go down!

364
00:28:39,515 --> 00:28:42,351
Dump the fuel. You'll have to pick
your way through the peaks.

365
00:28:42,435 --> 00:28:44,270
Close the fuel valve and pumps!

366
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:49,984
Don't bother to buckle up.
You may not want to survive this.

367
00:28:50,068 --> 00:28:52,737
Flaps to 25 degrees
before we lose all power.

368
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:54,822
Flaps, 25 degrees.

369
00:28:54,906 --> 00:28:57,741
Reduce power 60%.
Shut down all generators.

370
00:29:01,661 --> 00:29:04,456
Lower flaps. You may have
to hand-crank them down.

371
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:15,717
-You want the gear down?
-Leave the gear up. Shut down all power.

372
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:19,262
Give me a hand
with the controls.

373
00:30:04,056 --> 00:30:06,016
Wow! Did you catch that thunder?

374
00:30:06,058 --> 00:30:08,643
That was too loud for thunder.
Let's rock and roll.

375
00:30:08,727 --> 00:30:12,188
One, two, three!

376
00:30:15,692 --> 00:30:17,652
- I'm free!
- Radical, man.

377
00:30:17,736 --> 00:30:20,697
Man, look at me. Watch this.

378
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:32,709
Mike?

379
00:30:37,172 --> 00:30:38,757
Shit.

380
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:47,389
You thought of everything,
didn't you?

381
00:30:47,473 --> 00:30:49,391
Everything except
what's happening now.

382
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:53,812
Kill the pig!
Your fucking plan almost killed us!

383
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:59,026
Kill the pig, my ass.
We're partners in this.

384
00:30:59,068 --> 00:31:00,194
Were.

385
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,238
Give me the tracking monitor.

386
00:31:03,322 --> 00:31:05,741
What the hell are you
gonna do with it?

387
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:07,409
Don't make him ask twice.

388
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:10,079
Give it to him.

389
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:13,457
You want it? Take it.

390
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,001
It's only got
50,000 code variations.

391
00:31:16,085 --> 00:31:18,252
I'll break your fucking neck
in a minute!

392
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:20,463
- Go ahead. Break my fucking neck!
- Sit down.

393
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,133
In case you slept
through the landing...

394
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:27,095
you'll need all the money you can find
to buy your way out of this country.

395
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,347
You know it,
and I know it.

396
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:32,350
How do we get off the mountain,
even if we find it?

397
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:36,104
Kristel.

398
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:42,151
I think we found a frequency.

399
00:31:43,736 --> 00:31:45,780
Somebody help, please.

400
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:48,491
Is there somebody there?
Somebody please help.

401
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:51,411
Rocky Mountain Rescue. Come in.

402
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,579
Oh, thank God!

403
00:31:54,663 --> 00:31:59,042
Ah, we're stranded.
We were hiking and lost our bearings.

404
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,378
We didn't expect
the weather to come in this fast.

405
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:05,924
Just take it easy.
How many people in your party? Over.

406
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:10,929
Five people.
I don't know where we are.

407
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:16,810
I... I see only a cylinder-type
rock formation. Over.

408
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,520
It's got to be Comb Bluff.

409
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:22,107
Winds are too strong to get a chopper
up there. Try to stay calm.

410
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:24,192
We're on our way.
You're gonna be all right.

411
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:27,654
Please hurry.
Billy's going into shock.

412
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:29,780
Please, we need insulin.

413
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,324
Please, hurry.

414
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,037
"We need insulin."

415
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:41,959
Would you have thought of that?

416
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,515
- Thank God you didn't leave.
- Why?

417
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,143
Emergency call. Five climbers
are stranded off Comb Bluff.

418
00:32:59,226 --> 00:33:02,396
The weather's pouring in,
and Hal's gone up alone.

419
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,898
- Hal's a good climber.
- What?

420
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:07,025
What's that supposed to mean?

421
00:33:07,108 --> 00:33:09,652
It means he can handle it himself.

422
00:33:11,571 --> 00:33:14,908
It he gets socked in by the weather,
they'll never make it down.

423
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:17,994
Gabe, he needs someone
who has emergency medical training...

424
00:33:18,036 --> 00:33:20,080
and knows every handle
to those peaks.

425
00:33:20,163 --> 00:33:23,750
I'm the last one he wants help from, and
that's not what I came back here for.

426
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:26,544
Our problems are not the issue
right now. Those people are.

427
00:33:26,586 --> 00:33:29,381
What it he can't do it alone?

428
00:33:29,464 --> 00:33:32,467
Look, Jessie,
I haven't climbed in months.

429
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,344
You just lose the feel.

430
00:33:34,386 --> 00:33:37,180
Maybe you mean the nerve.

431
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:45,729
I didn't mean that.

432
00:33:48,565 --> 00:33:50,526
It's okay.

433
00:33:50,567 --> 00:33:53,862
I know you don't want to be responsible
for anybody's life anymore...

434
00:33:53,904 --> 00:33:56,907
but I'm talking about somebody
that was your best friend.

435
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:58,909
Please, Gabe,
he took the west ridge.

436
00:33:58,992 --> 00:34:02,037
It you take the north face,
you can beat him.

437
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:06,667
What has happened to you?
Don't you feel anything anymore?

438
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:10,713
Feel anything?
Jessie, I came back for you.

439
00:34:10,754 --> 00:34:12,715
I'm not talking about me.

440
00:34:12,756 --> 00:34:14,716
I'm talking about you.

441
00:34:17,093 --> 00:34:19,429
Go ahead... leave.

442
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:22,974
But if you don't do it, you'll be stuck
on that ledge for the rest of your life.

443
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:50,625
Where the hell is that
goddamn plane?

444
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:53,253
Looks like she went down
in the storm.

445
00:34:53,295 --> 00:34:57,007
That storm front is still building, so
even it we could send a search plane...

446
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,968
it would be impossible
to see anything on the ground.

447
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:03,805
- What about roads?
- There aren't any roads up there.

448
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:05,807
Mr. Wright.

449
00:35:05,891 --> 00:35:08,351
These two F. B. I. agents
insist on seeing you.

450
00:35:08,435 --> 00:35:11,104
I'm Agent Hayes.
This is Agent Michaels.

451
00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:14,483
It you're concerned about your agent who
got a ride, I've nothing to tell you.

452
00:35:16,318 --> 00:35:19,654
Matheson wasn't along for the ride.
He was working surveillance.

453
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:21,782
Surveillance? Of what?

454
00:35:21,865 --> 00:35:25,118
The Bureau have been getting reports
Treasury jets were being monitored...

455
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,994
between Denver
and San Francisco.

456
00:35:27,036 --> 00:35:29,997
We didn't tell you because
we thought it might be an inside job.

457
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:33,417
That's impossible.
You're suggesting a hijacking?

458
00:35:33,501 --> 00:35:36,921
No. Not only did I have
my best men on that flight...

459
00:35:37,004 --> 00:35:39,423
but each one of those cases
were monitored.

460
00:35:39,507 --> 00:35:42,468
And the money
is in unexchangeable denominations.

461
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,513
It would be useless
for anybody to try to steal it.

462
00:35:45,596 --> 00:35:47,348
Except for this man.

463
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:49,809
- Who the hell is this?
- Name is Eric Qualen.

464
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,728
We've been tracking him
without much success.

465
00:35:52,812 --> 00:35:54,730
He's a former member
of military intelligence...

466
00:35:54,814 --> 00:35:57,316
who found it more profitable
going to the other side.

467
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:00,820
Industrial espionage.
Hijacking diamonds from South Africa.

468
00:36:00,903 --> 00:36:03,863
Theft and disposal of millions
in negotiable bearer bonds.

469
00:36:03,947 --> 00:36:08,451
You name it. He has the international
connections to move this currency...

470
00:36:08,535 --> 00:36:12,706
and $100 million offers one hell
of a temptation to this psychotic.

471
00:36:12,747 --> 00:36:15,041
Jesus Christ.

472
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:45,028
What the hell
are you doing up here, man?

473
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,531
I was talking to Jessie.
She filled me in.

474
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:49,283
Did she?

475
00:36:49,366 --> 00:36:51,452
Well, now let me till you in.

476
00:36:51,535 --> 00:36:56,915
You can take your ass down and go back
to that hole you've been hiding in.

477
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:01,378
Once we get these people down,
I'm gone, Hal.

478
00:37:01,462 --> 00:37:04,214
No. You're out of here now.

479
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:10,179
Why the hell did you come up here?
To prove something?

480
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:12,680
Look, I know how you feel
about me, all right.

481
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:14,640
You don't know anything!

482
00:37:15,725 --> 00:37:19,353
You did it your way
and she died.

483
00:37:28,654 --> 00:37:31,491
- I did what I thought was right.
- Well, you were wrong.

484
00:37:31,574 --> 00:37:33,951
It was your weight on the line
that did it.

485
00:37:34,035 --> 00:37:36,579
There wasn't time
for anything else.

486
00:37:36,662 --> 00:37:38,539
Well, I guess we'll never know.

487
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:40,625
It was a bad time for everybody.

488
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:43,336
What the hell do you know
about bad times, man?

489
00:37:43,419 --> 00:37:46,881
You didn't love her, and you didn't
have to explain to her family.

490
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:49,966
And you didn't have to look
into her eyes when she was falling!

491
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:52,803
- Now drop it!
- No, buddy!

492
00:37:55,555 --> 00:37:58,100
It was you who dropped it.

493
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:09,486
You want to do it?

494
00:38:09,569 --> 00:38:11,154
Do it.

495
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,328
You live with it.

496
00:38:49,692 --> 00:38:51,819
They're here.

497
00:38:51,902 --> 00:38:53,904
Right on time.

498
00:38:53,988 --> 00:38:56,741
How many of them are there?

499
00:38:56,824 --> 00:39:00,785
We got two heroes.
We'll greet 'em at the top.

500
00:39:08,334 --> 00:39:11,254
- Where's the helicopter?
- What the hell's going on?

501
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,803
- Where's the helicopter?
- It can't fly in this weather.

502
00:39:18,887 --> 00:39:21,890
- Is either of you a chopper pilot?
- No.

503
00:39:21,973 --> 00:39:24,267
What are your names?

504
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:26,352
Tucker and Walker.

505
00:39:26,436 --> 00:39:28,271
We're missing three bags.

506
00:39:28,354 --> 00:39:29,939
What's in them?

507
00:39:30,023 --> 00:39:31,399
None of your fucking business!

508
00:39:31,483 --> 00:39:36,403
Suits, socks, $100 million,
the usual stuff.

509
00:39:36,445 --> 00:39:39,365
Travers here was smart enough
to bring along a tracking device.

510
00:39:39,406 --> 00:39:41,700
Don't use my name, goddamn it.

511
00:39:50,793 --> 00:39:52,086
Key it.

512
00:39:54,296 --> 00:39:57,591
Look at the map. This is where
we've lost our belongings.

513
00:39:57,674 --> 00:40:00,427
The red dots on the monitor
are the three cases.

514
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:03,097
You recognize these locations?

515
00:40:06,308 --> 00:40:07,935
Let me jar your memory.

516
00:40:08,018 --> 00:40:10,186
It you don't recognize them,
you're useless.

517
00:40:10,269 --> 00:40:13,189
Useless items
are usually discarded.

518
00:40:13,272 --> 00:40:16,359
- Right, Travers?
- Get off my back, Qualen.

519
00:40:17,276 --> 00:40:18,820
Oft?

520
00:40:18,903 --> 00:40:22,281
I haven't even got on it yet.

521
00:40:22,323 --> 00:40:26,994
Once again, do you recognize
these locations?

522
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:34,502
Ryan.

523
00:40:41,718 --> 00:40:44,220
Yeah. We do.

524
00:40:44,303 --> 00:40:46,012
Then let's go.

525
00:40:50,976 --> 00:40:53,437
Wait a minute, asshole!

526
00:40:57,149 --> 00:40:58,316
Where is it?

527
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:06,116
Up there.

528
00:41:08,326 --> 00:41:12,122
Rescue 1, this is Rescue Center.
Hal? Come in, Hal.

529
00:41:12,164 --> 00:41:15,000
Nice. You're Hal?

530
00:41:16,918 --> 00:41:19,004
You, stay. You!

531
00:41:21,881 --> 00:41:23,340
Fetch.

532
00:41:30,765 --> 00:41:33,184
Fetch!

533
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:34,810
Do it.

534
00:41:40,775 --> 00:41:43,027
Rescue 1, this is Rescue Center.

535
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:45,279
Do you copy?

536
00:41:45,363 --> 00:41:49,033
Hal, come in.
Hal, come in. Over.

537
00:41:58,541 --> 00:42:02,170
Watch yourself under the overhang.
It could deliver anytime.

538
00:42:02,212 --> 00:42:05,840
Anytime you feel
like saying something, don't.

539
00:42:05,924 --> 00:42:08,134
We're waiting, gentlemen.

540
00:42:08,218 --> 00:42:10,345
- I need my bolt gun and ice ax.
- No.

541
00:42:10,387 --> 00:42:13,473
- Don't give him anything.
- Take his coat for insurance.

542
00:42:14,474 --> 00:42:16,726
He could freeze to death!

543
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:19,396
You've got your own problems, Hal.

544
00:42:22,691 --> 00:42:27,404
Ryan, get a rope.
I want this dog on a leash too.

545
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,866
Tie it. It better hold.

546
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,795
Forget me.
It you can, get away.

547
00:42:44,878 --> 00:42:46,463
Would you?

548
00:42:49,675 --> 00:42:51,593
Go fetch, wonder dog.

549
00:43:13,948 --> 00:43:15,908
Move it, Walker.

550
00:43:19,328 --> 00:43:22,623
Keep it taut.
Ryan, keep it taut!

551
00:43:25,668 --> 00:43:29,255
Hal, come in please.
Hal, come in please. Over.

552
00:43:54,488 --> 00:43:56,114
I don't trust him.

553
00:44:30,356 --> 00:44:31,941
Damn.

554
00:44:38,072 --> 00:44:40,366
I don't think
we need two guides.

555
00:44:41,701 --> 00:44:44,036
Retire him when he comes down.

556
00:44:44,078 --> 00:44:47,623
They're going to kill you!
Don't come down!

557
00:44:47,707 --> 00:44:49,792
Pull the rope. Pull the rope!

558
00:44:52,336 --> 00:44:54,879
Pull, goddamn it! Pull!

559
00:45:00,218 --> 00:45:02,762
- Come on! Pull!
- Pull it!

560
00:45:06,057 --> 00:45:07,475
Pull, goddamn it!

561
00:45:07,559 --> 00:45:09,144
Ow!

562
00:45:25,827 --> 00:45:27,037
Watch it!

563
00:45:28,413 --> 00:45:30,539
- Get him!
- No!

564
00:45:30,622 --> 00:45:32,249
Do it.

565
00:46:53,036 --> 00:46:56,456
Your friend just had
the most expensive funeral in history.

566
00:46:56,498 --> 00:46:58,709
Now it's only you.

567
00:46:58,792 --> 00:47:01,294
Come in, Rescue Unit. Come in.

568
00:47:01,378 --> 00:47:04,589
Hal, what's going on? Hal?

569
00:47:04,673 --> 00:47:06,174
Talk.

570
00:47:06,258 --> 00:47:09,177
No messages, no codes,
no tricks.

571
00:47:09,261 --> 00:47:12,389
You haven't found us.
It was a take call.

572
00:47:13,473 --> 00:47:15,599
Jessie, I've just reached
the top of the tower.

573
00:47:15,683 --> 00:47:18,019
So far,
there's no sign of anyone.

574
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,521
Looks like a phony call. Over.

575
00:47:20,563 --> 00:47:24,608
You've got to be kidding me. Do you
want me to fly up after you? Over.

576
00:47:24,692 --> 00:47:27,111
No. Negative.
The winds are still too high.

577
00:47:27,194 --> 00:47:29,530
I'm going to ride out
the storm up here.

578
00:47:29,572 --> 00:47:32,658
We'll take shelter
at the old Doug...

579
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:34,368
Hal, I'm losing you.
Come in.

580
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:36,579
Come in, Hal. Over.

581
00:47:36,662 --> 00:47:39,498
Go on to the next case.

582
00:47:42,209 --> 00:47:46,005
He said the tower,
but he's on Comb Bluff.

583
00:47:46,047 --> 00:47:49,341
Frank, fly me to the west valley.
The winds are never too strong there.

584
00:47:49,383 --> 00:47:51,760
It's only a half-hour climb
to the Douglas Shaft.

585
00:47:51,843 --> 00:47:54,220
It's the only shelter around.
Hal would have to go there.

586
00:47:54,262 --> 00:47:57,891
- Jessie, that is a bad idea.
- Please, Frank.

587
00:47:57,974 --> 00:48:00,977
If I don't find him,
you can come pick me up by nightfall.

588
00:48:01,061 --> 00:48:03,104
Hal would have my head.

589
00:48:03,188 --> 00:48:06,066
And it's such a handsome head.

590
00:48:08,401 --> 00:48:10,737
Please, Frank.

591
00:48:10,779 --> 00:48:13,073
I'll buy one of your paintings.

592
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:24,376
Hold up!

593
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,171
Where is it?

594
00:48:35,094 --> 00:48:37,429
There. On top of the peak.

595
00:48:37,471 --> 00:48:39,264
- Come on.
- Hold it.

596
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:43,477
Looks like a winding route to me.

597
00:48:45,479 --> 00:48:48,649
The fastest way is
straight up the east face.

598
00:48:48,732 --> 00:48:51,777
Of course, there are only 12 guys
in the world who could do it.

599
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:53,487
You want to try it?

600
00:50:38,381 --> 00:50:41,008
Gabe. What's happened?

601
00:50:41,092 --> 00:50:43,969
Oh, my God. You're frozen.
Come sit down.

602
00:50:44,053 --> 00:50:48,139
Gabe, where's your pack, your sweater?
Talk to me. What happened?

603
00:50:48,223 --> 00:50:49,683
They got Hal.

604
00:50:49,724 --> 00:50:52,352
The distress call was a fake.

605
00:50:53,853 --> 00:50:56,231
Fake? What do you mean
it was fake?

606
00:50:56,314 --> 00:51:00,151
Before they crashed,
they dumped cases of money.

607
00:51:00,235 --> 00:51:02,237
- Who's they?
- I don't know.

608
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,699
They're using Hal to find it.
When they do, he's dead.

609
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,576
You gotta get on the radio
and call Frank...

610
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:12,497
and tell him to call
the state police.

611
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,500
The cold killed my radio,
but Frank's gonna be looking for me.

612
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,253
- We'll contact them from the chopper.
- The sun goes down in an hour.

613
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:20,255
What do you want me to do?

614
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:23,757
Let's take everything we need.
Let's move.

615
00:51:23,841 --> 00:51:26,218
We got to get to that next case
before they do.

616
00:51:31,807 --> 00:51:33,267
We're close!

617
00:51:33,308 --> 00:51:36,270
- It's just up there!
- It better be.

618
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:41,316
You know something? I'm getting
real fucking tired of your threats.

619
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,985
Are you?

620
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,065
It's there.

621
00:52:34,576 --> 00:52:37,496
Oh, my God.
What do we do now?

622
00:52:37,537 --> 00:52:39,122
You got a pencil?

623
00:53:22,206 --> 00:53:23,833
Over here.

624
00:53:45,603 --> 00:53:47,188
Goddamn.

625
00:53:49,065 --> 00:53:51,693
The son of a bitch
is still alive!

626
00:53:57,824 --> 00:54:00,243
I'm beginning to dislike
this Mr. Walker.

627
00:54:02,412 --> 00:54:05,248
He can't be tar.
Find him. Go.

628
00:54:27,561 --> 00:54:29,146
Go.

629
00:55:09,227 --> 00:55:10,144
Come on.

630
00:55:24,701 --> 00:55:26,160
Give me a flare.

631
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:29,664
- Meet me at Eagle's Cape.
- I'm not leaving.

632
00:55:29,706 --> 00:55:31,666
Don't worry about me!

633
00:56:52,077 --> 00:56:53,995
Gravity's a bitch, isn't it?

634
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,414
Fuck the money, and fuck you!

635
00:56:56,456 --> 00:56:59,000
I wasn't born to die
on a mountain.

636
00:56:59,084 --> 00:57:01,378
Where were you born to die?
Got a place picked out?

637
00:57:01,419 --> 00:57:04,089
I don't need to hear
that shit from you, boy.

638
00:57:04,172 --> 00:57:07,008
Maybe this boy should make
this big mouth bigger.

639
00:57:07,092 --> 00:57:09,094
Stop this!

640
00:57:09,177 --> 00:57:11,930
The fights not here.
It's out there.

641
00:57:16,101 --> 00:57:18,019
Find us some shelter.

642
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:28,987
Next time you're, like,
watching MTV, you know...

643
00:57:29,071 --> 00:57:32,449
take a split second
and flip it to the Weather Channel.

644
00:57:32,491 --> 00:57:35,494
I mean, hey, where would you
rather be right now?

645
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,872
Here in tent city, or at home
playing some righteous air hockey?

646
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:40,874
Air hockey's definitely
got my vote.

647
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:43,877
Exactly, cheesehead,
exactly.

648
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,879
- Cheesehead?
- Cheesehead.

649
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:53,554
- He was here.
- What was in there?

650
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:55,763
Answer the man.

651
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:59,142
- Nothing. Just tourist souvenirs.
- Or equipment.

652
00:57:59,183 --> 00:58:02,103
Maybe Walker plans
to look after his friend here.

653
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,147
He's not my friend...

654
00:58:04,188 --> 00:58:07,483
and I don't like him
any more than I do you.

655
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,694
Nice try.

656
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:13,531
But I never underestimate the power
of loyalty when it comes naturally.

657
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,577
Not like the kind
that has to be paid for.

658
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,455
Make a tire.

659
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:26,294
It costs a fortune
to heat this place.

660
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,797
That's bad humor, I know.

661
00:58:38,847 --> 00:58:41,850
We better get some sleep.
We're gonna need it.

662
00:58:55,197 --> 00:58:57,783
Rescue units, come in.

663
00:58:57,866 --> 00:59:00,911
Again, do you read? Come in.

664
00:59:00,994 --> 00:59:04,206
What the hell
is going on up there?

665
00:59:04,247 --> 00:59:05,539
Hal.

666
00:59:05,623 --> 00:59:08,584
Jessie, do you read?

667
00:59:08,668 --> 00:59:12,296
Jessie. It looks as if
we're drawing a crowd.

668
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:15,341
We're down to a few hours before
the whole fucking world shows up.

669
00:59:15,424 --> 00:59:17,385
- Where's the next one?
- On the tower.

670
00:59:17,426 --> 00:59:18,886
How far?

671
00:59:20,137 --> 00:59:23,057
He asked how far, goddamn it!

672
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:27,311
You know what I think? I think
you've been taking the scenic route.

673
00:59:27,395 --> 00:59:29,522
How far is it?

674
00:59:29,605 --> 00:59:31,607
Halt a day.

675
00:59:31,691 --> 00:59:35,069
- It's half a day.
- Hey, Hal!

676
00:59:35,111 --> 00:59:38,823
Check it out, man. It's Hal.
Hey, man, you stuck up here too?

677
00:59:38,906 --> 00:59:41,449
- You missed a great jump yesterday.
- Walk over.

678
00:59:41,533 --> 00:59:44,160
For Christ's sakes, man,
they're just kids.

679
00:59:44,244 --> 00:59:47,163
- Why don't you let them go?
- We're not animals.

680
00:59:47,247 --> 00:59:50,375
Don't force us to be.
Walk over.

681
00:59:51,459 --> 00:59:54,504
Hey, man, was that storm
a real bummer or what?

682
00:59:54,587 --> 00:59:56,506
Me and him were
in tent city last night.

683
00:59:57,590 --> 00:59:59,384
- Yeah.
- Hey, Hal.

684
00:59:59,426 --> 01:00:02,470
We're gonna take one last jump
and split.

685
01:00:02,554 --> 01:00:04,264
You baby-sitting hikers?

686
01:00:06,725 --> 01:00:08,893
- Run, man, run!
- What?

687
01:00:08,977 --> 01:00:10,562
Get the hell out...

688
01:00:39,465 --> 01:00:41,717
Son of a bitch.
You didn't have to kill him!

689
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,260
Shut up!

690
01:00:44,428 --> 01:00:46,180
Sue me.

691
01:00:49,475 --> 01:00:50,893
Fuck.

692
01:01:22,006 --> 01:01:23,132
Shoot him!

693
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:25,927
Shoot him!

694
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:28,845
You're letting him get away!
Shoot him!

695
01:01:49,533 --> 01:01:51,493
Shit. Ow!

696
01:01:56,331 --> 01:01:57,874
You murdering motherfuck.

697
01:01:59,001 --> 01:02:01,211
Kill a few people,
they call you a murderer.

698
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:05,339
Kill a million,
and you're a conqueror.

699
01:02:05,381 --> 01:02:07,216
Go figure.

700
01:02:07,299 --> 01:02:10,469
Move on, Tucker.
Time is short.

701
01:02:56,598 --> 01:02:58,850
Okay. Just like you said.

702
01:02:58,933 --> 01:03:01,394
He's taking them the long way around.

703
01:03:01,436 --> 01:03:04,397
To stay ahead of them, we're gonna
have to go through that crack.

704
01:03:08,068 --> 01:03:10,236
You said there was a way across.

705
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,655
There is.

706
01:03:11,738 --> 01:03:13,530
- Where the fuck is it?
- There.

707
01:03:13,614 --> 01:03:15,032
You blind?

708
01:03:17,785 --> 01:03:20,954
Hell with the money.
Radio the chopper.

709
01:03:22,581 --> 01:03:24,875
You just don't get it, do you?

710
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:29,171
We're in bed now, joined at the hip,
partners in crime.

711
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:35,302
You've crossed over, Travers,
and there's no crossing back.

712
01:03:57,824 --> 01:04:00,201
All right,
that'll keep it dry.

713
01:04:08,126 --> 01:04:10,670
Okay, let's do it.

714
01:04:14,799 --> 01:04:16,801
Get a good tooting.

715
01:04:18,428 --> 01:04:20,388
Okay.

716
01:04:26,518 --> 01:04:28,437
It's slick, Jess.

717
01:04:31,732 --> 01:04:33,942
Good foothold.

718
01:05:06,891 --> 01:05:09,518
Jessie, don't move.

719
01:05:12,104 --> 01:05:14,065
Oh, my God.

720
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:18,527
- Let's get out of here.
- No!

721
01:05:20,863 --> 01:05:22,782
Jessie, you gotta get down!

722
01:05:22,865 --> 01:05:24,283
Come on!

723
01:05:26,243 --> 01:05:27,411
Get down!

724
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:30,498
Stay close to me.

725
01:05:34,543 --> 01:05:37,212
All right, get down.

726
01:05:37,253 --> 01:05:38,505
Hold on to me.

727
01:05:40,507 --> 01:05:42,300
It's on my back!

728
01:05:49,724 --> 01:05:51,226
Let's get out!

729
01:05:53,103 --> 01:05:55,814
It's off your back.
There's nothing on your back.

730
01:05:55,897 --> 01:05:57,357
It's okay.

731
01:06:01,820 --> 01:06:04,990
Rocky Mountain Rescue Center,
this is Rescue 3. Over.

732
01:06:06,491 --> 01:06:09,202
Rescue 3, this is Rescue Center.
Go ahead.

733
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:13,372
The vis is good. I've got
at least 20 miles in all directions.

734
01:06:13,455 --> 01:06:16,250
If anyone's out here,
I'll find them. Over.

735
01:06:16,291 --> 01:06:18,293
Roger, 3. Center out.

736
01:06:30,014 --> 01:06:31,724
Center, this is 3.

737
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:35,227
I've picked up a signal on the thermal
imager just north of Comb Bluff.

738
01:06:35,310 --> 01:06:37,271
Landing to investigate.

739
01:07:24,358 --> 01:07:27,402
Get out! Get out of here!

740
01:07:29,071 --> 01:07:31,573
Get the hell out!

741
01:07:36,161 --> 01:07:37,579
Jesus Christ.

742
01:07:41,166 --> 01:07:44,252
Here, I got you.
I got you.

743
01:07:44,336 --> 01:07:47,422
I got you, son. I got you.

744
01:07:47,506 --> 01:07:49,925
There's the opening.

745
01:07:50,008 --> 01:07:52,844
When I get up there,
I'll hook up the line...

746
01:07:52,886 --> 01:07:54,680
and you follow me up.

747
01:07:54,721 --> 01:07:57,264
- Okay?
- All right.

748
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:09,110
- The other one is following.
- I'll move to a high point, flank him.

749
01:08:09,193 --> 01:08:11,570
Don't kill him
until you get the money.

750
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:13,072
Sure.

751
01:08:18,828 --> 01:08:21,038
Mr. Wright, we found the I. D.
on the dead pilot.

752
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,249
He was known to fly for Qualen.
Over.

753
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:25,626
What about the Treasury jet?
Over.

754
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:27,712
Its wreckage is scattered
over a two-mile area.

755
01:08:27,795 --> 01:08:30,089
No bodies have been found.
Over.

756
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:34,175
Finally. An F. A. A. satellite
has located a downed aircraft.

757
01:08:34,259 --> 01:08:38,263
Head 110 miles south-southwest
of the park entrance.

758
01:08:39,055 --> 01:08:41,683
Treasury Control, get
the rescue people on their way.

759
01:08:41,766 --> 01:08:44,102
We're headed straight there.
One out.

760
01:08:44,144 --> 01:08:45,562
Center out.

761
01:09:10,794 --> 01:09:13,172
I got it, Jess.

762
01:09:13,255 --> 01:09:15,924
We're almost out.
I can chop through.

763
01:09:44,202 --> 01:09:45,536
Jessie, come on up!

764
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:47,038
Okay!

765
01:09:53,378 --> 01:09:54,671
Walker.

766
01:09:54,754 --> 01:09:57,465
Small world, ain't it?

767
01:09:57,548 --> 01:09:59,592
Don't even think about it.

768
01:10:01,135 --> 01:10:03,096
Your lifes on sale, Walker.

769
01:10:03,179 --> 01:10:04,931
The price is 30 million.

770
01:10:05,014 --> 01:10:07,725
- Where is it?
- It's gone.

771
01:10:08,851 --> 01:10:11,813
What the fuck are you talking about?
Where's the money?

772
01:10:11,854 --> 01:10:14,732
I burned it.
Never could save anything.

773
01:10:15,733 --> 01:10:19,611
Not even a dumb mountain boy like you
would burn $30 million.

774
01:10:20,404 --> 01:10:23,115
I don't make deals, Walker,
but I'll make one with you.

775
01:10:23,198 --> 01:10:26,743
Hand over the money, and I'll
just kill you and not the girl.

776
01:10:28,161 --> 01:10:29,538
Give me the money!

777
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:35,460
Gabe?

778
01:10:37,212 --> 01:10:38,672
All right.

779
01:10:55,021 --> 01:10:57,648
Come on. Come on!

780
01:10:57,732 --> 01:10:59,191
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

781
01:10:59,233 --> 01:11:01,277
Kynette, what's going on?
Where's the money?

782
01:11:02,945 --> 01:11:05,364
- He said he torched it.
- Where is he now?

783
01:11:05,406 --> 01:11:07,033
He dropped down into some cave.

784
01:11:08,075 --> 01:11:09,994
You've had your chance.
Move it out now.

785
01:11:10,077 --> 01:11:11,871
- Kristel, get the C-4.
- Roger.

786
01:11:11,912 --> 01:11:13,914
Just give me five minutes.

787
01:11:13,998 --> 01:11:16,751
I said get the fuck out of there.

788
01:11:16,834 --> 01:11:20,004
Good. And blow up that black bastard
while you're at it.

789
01:11:20,087 --> 01:11:22,631
Save me the time
of doing it meself.

790
01:11:41,524 --> 01:11:45,236
It you want me, I'll be here!

791
01:11:50,825 --> 01:11:52,786
I'm in here!

792
01:12:04,839 --> 01:12:06,799
I'm in here.

793
01:12:11,845 --> 01:12:13,472
You're making it too easy for me.

794
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,623
No bullets, bitch!

795
01:12:49,132 --> 01:12:52,760
Now, I'm gonna ask you just three times:
where's the money?

796
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:57,724
Sissy.

797
01:12:57,807 --> 01:12:59,392
You hit like a sissy.

798
01:13:01,519 --> 01:13:04,856
Wrong answer, motherfucker!

799
01:13:07,358 --> 01:13:09,277
Get up!

800
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,322
Now, I'm gonna ask you
for a second time.

801
01:13:12,363 --> 01:13:14,866
Where is the money?

802
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:17,909
Burned it.

803
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:19,953
Wrong answer!

804
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:31,423
Time to kill a mountain man.

805
01:13:36,428 --> 01:13:40,432
It amazes me, in this day and age,
when a man...

806
01:13:40,515 --> 01:13:42,559
will put money...

807
01:13:42,643 --> 01:13:44,895
before the personal safety...

808
01:13:44,936 --> 01:13:48,190
of himself and his bitch.

809
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:55,112
At least you can go
to your grave knowing...

810
01:13:55,196 --> 01:13:57,490
that I'm gonna treat the bitch...

811
01:13:58,574 --> 01:14:00,201
right!

812
01:14:18,928 --> 01:14:22,223
Are you okay? Oh, God!
I thought he killed you!

813
01:14:23,432 --> 01:14:26,268
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

814
01:14:29,354 --> 01:14:32,357
Hal, Jessie, do you read?

815
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:34,567
Again, do you read?
Come in.

816
01:14:36,528 --> 01:14:38,780
Hal, Jessie, what the hell's
goin' on up there?

817
01:14:38,863 --> 01:14:41,116
Jessie, find it.

818
01:14:54,587 --> 01:14:55,922
It's ready.

819
01:14:57,632 --> 01:14:59,551
Rescue 1, Rescue 2.

820
01:14:59,634 --> 01:15:02,095
- Do you copy? Over.
- Here it is!

821
01:15:02,928 --> 01:15:05,222
I found Evan in the east valley.

822
01:15:05,306 --> 01:15:07,224
He's got a gunshot wound
in the back.

823
01:15:07,308 --> 01:15:10,853
He's en route to the medical center
in Granby in critical condition.

824
01:15:10,936 --> 01:15:14,565
In case you can hear this,
I'm resuming my search.

825
01:15:14,648 --> 01:15:15,816
Come on!

826
01:15:18,444 --> 01:15:21,280
You'll make somebody
a fine wife someday.

827
01:15:23,991 --> 01:15:25,367
You should see me bake a cake.

828
01:15:39,172 --> 01:15:42,550
He's still alive,
for another four minutes.

829
01:15:42,634 --> 01:15:45,511
- Where's it set?
- Primed to go off right over his head.

830
01:15:46,387 --> 01:15:48,473
Fuck!

831
01:15:50,183 --> 01:15:52,185
Gabe, three minutes!
There's a bomb!

832
01:15:52,268 --> 01:15:55,688
Get the hell out of there!
There's a bomb over your head!

833
01:15:58,608 --> 01:16:00,985
Jessie, get the gear!

834
01:16:07,492 --> 01:16:10,411
Come on, Jessie. This way.

835
01:16:10,495 --> 01:16:13,289
That charge is gonna cause a landslide.
We gotta get to the west face.

836
01:16:17,209 --> 01:16:19,419
Why the hell are we wasting time?

837
01:16:19,503 --> 01:16:22,339
Making sure he's not
going to find that last case.

838
01:16:27,135 --> 01:16:29,054
You want to kill me,
don't you, Tucker?

839
01:16:30,263 --> 01:16:32,641
Well, take a number
and get in line.

840
01:16:37,354 --> 01:16:40,440
The ledge is too far. Take this rope
and pull it apart and tie it together.

841
01:16:40,524 --> 01:16:42,734
- We're gonna rappel down.
- This rope is 60 years old.

842
01:16:42,818 --> 01:16:44,653
- Will it hold?
- Don't think so.

843
01:16:44,736 --> 01:16:45,862
Bad answer.

844
01:17:00,876 --> 01:17:02,795
Frank! Frank!

845
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:07,383
- No, Frank!
- He can't see you.

846
01:17:07,466 --> 01:17:09,385
Go!

847
01:17:24,649 --> 01:17:27,861
Here comes our ride. Move.

848
01:17:29,571 --> 01:17:32,157
Okay, now, swing as hard
as you can. Push!

849
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:21,205
Jump.

850
01:19:17,884 --> 01:19:20,762
Frank! Frank! Frank!

851
01:19:55,087 --> 01:19:57,923
What's happening here?
Where's the rest of the group?

852
01:19:59,592 --> 01:20:01,218
Welcome.

853
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:02,803
What are you doing?

854
01:20:02,887 --> 01:20:04,639
Now, back off!

855
01:20:05,931 --> 01:20:07,850
I came here to help you.

856
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:09,977
You did.

857
01:20:10,061 --> 01:20:11,771
Don't move.

858
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:18,235
- Frank! Frank!
- Better hurry, Tucker.

859
01:20:20,404 --> 01:20:21,822
Get out of here!

860
01:20:45,095 --> 01:20:46,805
You stupid maniac!

861
01:20:46,888 --> 01:20:50,266
- No one told you to shoot.
- We've wasted enough time.

862
01:20:50,308 --> 01:20:51,768
Frank?

863
01:21:06,115 --> 01:21:08,242
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

864
01:21:15,416 --> 01:21:17,918
This man never hurt anybody!

865
01:21:19,336 --> 01:21:21,380
Touching.

866
01:21:21,463 --> 01:21:23,841
Kristel, check the chopper.
Let's go.

867
01:21:52,035 --> 01:21:53,995
Get back! Get back!

868
01:21:54,037 --> 01:21:56,914
Go! Jessie, run!

869
01:22:15,891 --> 01:22:17,809
That son of a bitch.

870
01:22:19,519 --> 01:22:23,273
All right. We use a chopper
to locate the third case.

871
01:22:23,357 --> 01:22:26,234
- Then we get the hell out of here.
- No.

872
01:22:26,276 --> 01:22:28,445
There's not enough fuel
to search around.

873
01:22:28,528 --> 01:22:30,405
Just enough to get us down.

874
01:22:30,447 --> 01:22:32,824
You're not running things,
Travers.

875
01:22:33,909 --> 01:22:36,828
As soon as he finds the money,
you're as dead as me.

876
01:22:38,830 --> 01:22:41,541
Give me the monitor.

877
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:43,001
Now.

878
01:22:56,138 --> 01:22:59,934
- What's the code, Travers?
- I told you, Qualen.

879
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:03,270
Fifty thousand possible
key code combinations...

880
01:23:03,354 --> 01:23:05,272
in 15-second intervals.

881
01:23:06,107 --> 01:23:08,651
So, what's the fucking code?

882
01:23:15,783 --> 01:23:18,202
Well, look
what Agent Travers found.

883
01:23:18,285 --> 01:23:20,203
I guess he is running things
after all.

884
01:23:20,287 --> 01:23:22,247
Isn't he?

885
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:27,043
So what's the plan, Travers?
We use the chopper to find the money.

886
01:23:27,127 --> 01:23:28,211
Right?

887
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:32,007
What a good idea.

888
01:23:32,090 --> 01:23:34,676
But then again...

889
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:37,637
without a pilot...

890
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:40,140
nobody even gets off
this mountain.

891
01:23:41,474 --> 01:23:43,393
What are you doing, Eric?

892
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:47,856
Do you know what
real love is, Kristel?

893
01:23:51,484 --> 01:23:52,902
Sacrifice.

894
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:07,791
Now I'm the only one
who can fly us out of here.

895
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:10,002
We're partners again.

896
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:13,964
Now, take your toy...

897
01:24:14,006 --> 01:24:16,342
and find our money.

898
01:24:18,636 --> 01:24:20,304
Radio when you find it.

899
01:24:22,514 --> 01:24:24,433
I'm waiting here.

900
01:24:33,358 --> 01:24:35,777
All right, the last of the money's
at Crockett River.

901
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:38,112
If we take the northern ridge,
we can get there first.

902
01:24:38,196 --> 01:24:42,033
There is no "we." I'm gonna go along
the north trail to Bitker Ladder.

903
01:24:42,075 --> 01:24:44,118
You go on to the station
for help.

904
01:24:44,202 --> 01:24:47,664
- Are you crazy?
- It they find the money, Hal's dead.

905
01:24:47,747 --> 01:24:49,916
- Just get back there fast.
- All right.

906
01:24:49,999 --> 01:24:53,670
Roger, Control. But where the hell
are those National Guard choppers?

907
01:24:53,711 --> 01:24:55,922
They had a mechanical, sir.
It's being worked on now.

908
01:24:56,005 --> 01:24:59,175
- Their E. T. A. is one hour.
- An hour?

909
01:24:59,217 --> 01:25:02,136
You got to do better than that.
Now, get a move on. Out.

910
01:26:27,636 --> 01:26:28,928
Stop there.

911
01:26:32,766 --> 01:26:34,768
We're close.

912
01:26:34,851 --> 01:26:37,604
I got it locked in.

913
01:26:37,687 --> 01:26:40,899
So we're finished
with him, yeah?

914
01:26:40,982 --> 01:26:43,443
Yeah. Do it quietly.

915
01:26:43,526 --> 01:26:45,862
Your insane boss
just made enough noise...

916
01:26:45,945 --> 01:26:48,573
for anyone within ten miles
to hear us.

917
01:26:51,534 --> 01:26:53,494
It's been fun.

918
01:26:58,874 --> 01:27:00,834
Hey, Delmar.

919
01:27:01,877 --> 01:27:04,588
From me to you...

920
01:27:04,672 --> 01:27:07,132
you're an asshole.

921
01:27:07,216 --> 01:27:08,717
Yeah?

922
01:27:08,801 --> 01:27:11,679
And you're a loudmouth,
punk slag...

923
01:27:11,762 --> 01:27:14,306
who's about to die.

924
01:27:14,348 --> 01:27:15,474
Maybe.

925
01:27:17,059 --> 01:27:20,062
But in a minute I'll be dead.

926
01:27:20,145 --> 01:27:22,022
You...

927
01:27:22,064 --> 01:27:23,941
will always be an asshole.

928
01:27:24,024 --> 01:27:27,069
So go ahead and shoot.

929
01:27:27,152 --> 01:27:28,903
I'm getting cold.

930
01:27:32,949 --> 01:27:34,492
Shoot!

931
01:27:36,869 --> 01:27:38,496
Who's shooting?

932
01:27:44,585 --> 01:27:46,170
Tell me...

933
01:27:46,212 --> 01:27:48,506
do you like soccer?

934
01:27:48,548 --> 01:27:50,091
It's a great sport.

935
01:27:50,174 --> 01:27:54,971
I was a fucking good striker.
Isn't that something?

936
01:28:05,564 --> 01:28:08,191
Oh, God!

937
01:28:08,233 --> 01:28:09,568
Fuck you!

938
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:11,695
Ah, you're swearing now.

939
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:16,700
That's a penalty kick
for unsportsmanlike.

940
01:28:21,872 --> 01:28:23,248
A lovely little chip shot.

941
01:28:25,834 --> 01:28:28,629
He dribbles past one defender...

942
01:28:28,712 --> 01:28:31,048
two defenders...

943
01:28:31,089 --> 01:28:32,549
three defenders.

944
01:28:40,306 --> 01:28:42,475
Striker lines up
at the penalty spot.

945
01:28:42,558 --> 01:28:44,685
He focuses on the ball.

946
01:28:44,769 --> 01:28:46,687
The crowd is on its feet.

947
01:28:46,771 --> 01:28:49,231
Striker moves to his left.

948
01:28:49,273 --> 01:28:51,525
He draws back his foot.

949
01:28:51,609 --> 01:28:52,902
He comes in.

950
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:14,923
Season's over, asshole!

951
01:29:22,806 --> 01:29:25,433
I said quietly.

952
01:29:57,423 --> 01:29:59,967
What the fuck is going on?

953
01:30:02,011 --> 01:30:03,971
This is not right.

954
01:30:18,527 --> 01:30:19,987
Fuck!

955
01:30:38,504 --> 01:30:40,506
Goddamn.

956
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:42,967
Fuck you, Walker!

957
01:30:46,679 --> 01:30:48,931
Fucker!

958
01:30:57,065 --> 01:30:59,150
Goddamn it!

959
01:31:02,903 --> 01:31:04,863
Come in, goddamn it.

960
01:31:07,115 --> 01:31:09,076
Have you got what we need?

961
01:31:09,117 --> 01:31:12,537
It's Walker. The son of a bitch
is still alive, Qualen.

962
01:31:12,579 --> 01:31:14,539
No names.
This is an open line.

963
01:31:14,581 --> 01:31:17,125
I don't give a shit,
Eric Qualen!

964
01:31:18,752 --> 01:31:20,754
Had to be insane to tie up...

965
01:31:20,796 --> 01:31:23,882
with a lowlife piece of shit
like you anyway.

966
01:31:23,924 --> 01:31:25,050
They beat us.

967
01:31:26,426 --> 01:31:30,180
A couple of fucking
mountain rangers beat us.

968
01:31:30,263 --> 01:31:34,142
Jesus Christ, that's Travers.
Get a bead on that frequency.

969
01:31:34,226 --> 01:31:37,520
They beat the man
no law agency ever could.

970
01:31:37,603 --> 01:31:38,854
Get off the radio.

971
01:31:38,938 --> 01:31:41,857
And I'm finding that
pretty fuckin' hilarious, Qualen.

972
01:31:41,941 --> 01:31:44,151
Stop transmitting,
you stupid bastard!

973
01:31:44,235 --> 01:31:47,238
It's hard to believe I sold out
after 20 years...

974
01:31:47,321 --> 01:31:49,782
and this is my payback?

975
01:31:49,824 --> 01:31:53,327
To run on a mountain
with a fuckin' dirtbag like you!

976
01:31:53,411 --> 01:31:55,538
Travers, you've lost your mind.

977
01:31:56,622 --> 01:31:58,833
Lost it. Have I lost it?

978
01:31:58,916 --> 01:32:02,628
Fuckin' A, I've lost it, Qualen!
Pure, fuckin' section eight!

979
01:32:04,588 --> 01:32:06,674
I gotta go.

980
01:32:06,757 --> 01:32:09,468
I'm on my last official manhunt.

981
01:32:10,553 --> 01:32:12,470
Adiós, motherfucker!

982
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:22,314
You got a bearing
on that frequency yet?

983
01:32:23,523 --> 01:32:26,234
Yes. Eight minutes away.

984
01:32:44,502 --> 01:32:46,463
You're dead, Walker!

985
01:33:42,225 --> 01:33:43,393
Frank!

986
01:35:21,988 --> 01:35:23,448
I won, Walker!

987
01:35:41,716 --> 01:35:43,176
Gabe!

988
01:36:05,572 --> 01:36:07,533
Travers, come in.

989
01:36:12,663 --> 01:36:16,041
Compliments of Delmar.
Too late. You missed him.

990
01:36:16,083 --> 01:36:18,669
He decided to take a swim
to Arizona.

991
01:36:18,752 --> 01:36:21,629
- Tucker.
- That's right.

992
01:36:22,547 --> 01:36:24,716
Congratulations.

993
01:36:24,799 --> 01:36:25,883
Qualen?

994
01:36:27,218 --> 01:36:29,137
It's all over.

995
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:32,348
Walker. You resilient bastard.

996
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:35,101
So you're still alive.

997
01:36:35,184 --> 01:36:37,312
I want that money,
and I want it now.

998
01:36:37,395 --> 01:36:39,856
Qualen, the game's over.

999
01:36:39,897 --> 01:36:41,024
You lost.

1000
01:36:41,065 --> 01:36:44,235
Oh, no. The game's
just getting interesting.

1001
01:36:44,319 --> 01:36:46,279
I'm airborne now, you see.

1002
01:36:47,989 --> 01:36:50,783
As a matter of tact,
I've picked up a passenger...

1003
01:36:50,867 --> 01:36:52,577
you might be interested in.

1004
01:36:54,912 --> 01:36:56,872
Go on, talk.

1005
01:36:56,913 --> 01:36:59,166
I said talk, goddamn it!

1006
01:37:01,168 --> 01:37:04,004
Hal, he's got me. I'm sorry.
I thought he was Frank.

1007
01:37:04,087 --> 01:37:06,173
You get the picture, Walker?

1008
01:37:06,256 --> 01:37:08,759
Now, I want that money.

1009
01:37:08,842 --> 01:37:11,720
Meet me at the highest point
from where you are.

1010
01:37:11,762 --> 01:37:14,473
It you don't,
we're going to find out...

1011
01:37:14,556 --> 01:37:17,434
it this little angel of yours
can fly.

1012
01:37:18,644 --> 01:37:21,313
Jessie, take him to the highest point
near Bitker Ladder.

1013
01:37:21,396 --> 01:37:24,483
I'll meet you there.
Don't worry.

1014
01:37:24,566 --> 01:37:26,735
Love's a killer, isn't it?

1015
01:37:42,291 --> 01:37:45,503
- Where are you, Walker?
- You're getting warmer. Keep climbing.

1016
01:37:46,921 --> 01:37:48,673
You're getting closer.

1017
01:37:48,756 --> 01:37:50,716
Look out.

1018
01:38:08,525 --> 01:38:11,111
I must admit,
you're a real piece of work.

1019
01:38:11,194 --> 01:38:13,947
Yeah, and I must admit,
you're a real piece of shit.

1020
01:38:24,124 --> 01:38:26,084
Throw it up, or I'll kill her.

1021
01:38:26,167 --> 01:38:29,170
You do, and the cash is gone.

1022
01:38:29,254 --> 01:38:32,924
- The money.
- I want you to put her down.

1023
01:38:33,008 --> 01:38:34,426
Over there!

1024
01:39:28,478 --> 01:39:29,938
Jessie, run!

1025
01:39:30,021 --> 01:39:32,231
- What about you?
- Run!

1026
01:39:33,566 --> 01:39:34,984
Run!

1027
01:39:36,861 --> 01:39:38,112
Come on, Qualen.

1028
01:39:38,196 --> 01:39:41,366
I got what you want.
Come on.

1029
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:51,751
Come on. Come and get it.

1030
01:39:56,672 --> 01:39:58,590
Come on. Closer.

1031
01:39:59,675 --> 01:40:02,094
Come on, closer.

1032
01:40:02,135 --> 01:40:04,388
- A little closer, Qualen.
- Throw it in.

1033
01:40:04,429 --> 01:40:06,348
Bring it closer.

1034
01:40:07,432 --> 01:40:08,558
Oh, my God.

1035
01:40:15,857 --> 01:40:17,442
Throw it in.

1036
01:40:34,583 --> 01:40:36,544
Damn you, Walker!

1037
01:40:53,227 --> 01:40:54,395
Run!

1038
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:36,144
Jessie, move!

1039
01:41:47,029 --> 01:41:48,155
Come on.

1040
01:42:28,111 --> 01:42:31,447
It's just us now,
you piece of shit.

1041
01:42:46,337 --> 01:42:48,673
Watch out!

1042
01:42:48,756 --> 01:42:50,716
Get out of there, man!

1043
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:56,388
Stick around.

1044
01:43:00,100 --> 01:43:01,435
We had a deal...

1045
01:43:01,518 --> 01:43:03,979
and now we've
just got each other.

1046
01:43:05,188 --> 01:43:07,357
You're not afraid to die.

1047
01:43:12,779 --> 01:43:14,156
Come on, get him!

1048
01:43:19,786 --> 01:43:20,537
Get out of there!

1049
01:43:21,622 --> 01:43:23,081
Remember, shithead.

1050
01:43:23,123 --> 01:43:25,750
Keep your arms and legs
in the vehicle...

1051
01:43:25,791 --> 01:43:27,501
at all times!

1052
01:43:48,147 --> 01:43:50,149
Give me the rope!

1053
01:43:53,986 --> 01:43:55,446
Okay.

1054
01:43:59,367 --> 01:44:00,785
I'm out of here.

1055
01:44:23,640 --> 01:44:27,727
Gabe, buddy, you think you could have
put a little less effort in that climb?

1056
01:44:27,811 --> 01:44:30,480
I mean,
I thought you were in shape.

1057
01:44:31,856 --> 01:44:33,858
- I guess I'm just falling apart.
- Yeah.

1058
01:44:33,942 --> 01:44:35,652
This is Agent Wright. Copy?

1059
01:44:35,694 --> 01:44:39,405
- Yeah, copy.
- Please identify yourselves. Over.

1060
01:44:39,488 --> 01:44:42,074
Yeah, this is Hal Tucker,
Rocky Mountain Rescue.

1061
01:44:42,157 --> 01:44:44,827
Hey, we're glad
to see you guys.

1062
01:44:44,868 --> 01:44:46,829
If you're looking
for Mr. Qualen...

1063
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:49,957
try about 4,000 feet
south of here.

1064
01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:52,710
He'll be the one
wearing a helicopter. Over.

1065
01:44:52,793 --> 01:44:54,295
Good.

1066
01:44:54,378 --> 01:44:58,757
I'll arrange transportation for the
three of you. Sit tight for a while.
