1
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,559
Everybody, heads up. Keep it clear, now.

2
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,959
Keep it clear.

3
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,718
Stand back.

4
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,514
Slow it down.

5
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,875
- Pushing team, move in there.
- Move in.

6
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,678
- On your ready.
- I want tasers on full charge.

7
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,357
Steady! Go on. Step back in.

8
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,239
Ready. Move it.

9
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,794
And push!

10
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,873
Well, locked. Loading team, step away.

11
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,276
Jophery, raise the gate.

12
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,828
Block the opening! Don't let her get out!

13
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,273
Somebody help him!

14
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,272
Work her back!

15
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,315
Shoot her!

16
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,713
Shoot her!

17
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,757
- I heard that Hammond's not even here.
- He sends his apologies.

18
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,798
There's a $20 million lawsuit
for that worker's death...

19
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,348
...and you're telling me
that Hammond can't see me?

20
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,432
He had to leave early,
his daughter's getting a divorce.

21
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,432
I understand, but we need to deal
with the situation now.

22
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,590
- The insurance company...
- You okay?

23
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,352
The underwriters feel that the accident's
raised safety questions about the park.

24
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,916
That makes the investors very anxious.

25
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,436
I had to promise to conduct
a thorough, on-site inspection.

26
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,520
Hammond hates inspections.
They slow everything down.

27
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,558
They'll pull the funding.
That'll slow him down even more.

28
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,754
Watch your head.

29
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,075
If two experts sign off on the island,
the insurance guys'll back off.

30
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,352
I've already got lan Malcolm,
but they think he's too trendy.

31
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,953
- They want Alan Grant.
- Grant?

32
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,110
You'll never get him out of Montana.

33
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,635
Why not?

34
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,955
Why not?

35
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,311
Because Grant's like me.

36
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,473
He's a digger.

37
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,113
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler,
we're ready to try again.

38
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,873
I hate computers.

39
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,753
The feeling's mutual.

40
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,269
Take a look.

41
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,229
Did it work?

42
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,278
- How long does this take?
- Should bring an immediate return.

43
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,273
You shoot the radar into the ground,
and the bone bounces the image back.

44
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,353
Bounces it back...

45
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,316
This new program is incredible.

46
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,196
A few more years' development,
and we won't even have to dig anymore.

47
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,918
Where's the fun in that?

48
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,836
It's a little distorted,
but I don't think it's the computer.

49
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,872
Post-mortem contraction
of the posterior neck ligaments.

50
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,435
Velociraptor?

51
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,033
Yes. Good shape, too.

52
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,392
It's 5, 6 feet high. I'm guessing 9 feet long.

53
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,754
- Look...
- What'd you do?

54
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,829
He touched it.

55
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,988
- Dr. Grant's not machine compatible.
- Hell, they've got it in for me.

56
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,434
And look at the half-moon shaped bones
in the wrist.

57
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,875
It's no wonder these guys learned
how to fly.

58
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,989
No, seriously.

59
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,358
Maybe dinosaurs have more in common
with present-day birds than with reptiles.

60
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,031
Look at the pubic bone, turned backward,
like a bird's.

61
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,829
Look at the vertebrae,
full of air sacs and hollows, like a bird's.

62
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,193
And even the word "raptor"
means "bird of prey."

63
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,397
That doesn't look very scary.

64
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,631
More like a 6-foot turkey.

65
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,275
A turkey?

66
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,631
- Imagine yourself in the Cretaceous period.
- Here we go.

67
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,473
You'd get your first look at this
6-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.

68
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,239
He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.

69
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,759
You keep still because maybe
his visual acuity is based on movement...

70
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,513
...like T. Rex and he'll lose you
if you don't move.

71
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,716
But no, not Velociraptor.

72
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,869
You stare at him
and he just stares right back.

73
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,958
And that's when the attack comes.
Not from the front, but from the side.

74
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,156
From the other two Raptors
you didn't even know were there.

75
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,071
Because Velociraptor's a pack hunter.
He uses co-ordinated attack patterns...

76
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,551
...and he is out in force today.

77
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,716
And he slashes at you with this...

78
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,513
...a 6-inch retractable claw,
like a razor, on the middle toe.

79
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,474
He doesn't bother to bite your jugular
like a lion. No.

80
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,319
He slashes at you...

81
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,071
...here or here...

82
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,229
Alan.

83
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,709
Or maybe across the belly,
spilling your intestines.

84
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:38,550
The point is, you are alive
when they start to eat you.

85
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,118
So, you know, try to show a little respect.

86
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,116
Okay.

87
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,639
Alan, if you wanted to scare the kid,
you could've pulled a gun on him.

88
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,151
Yeah, I know. Kids.

89
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,231
You want to have one of those?

90
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,076
I don't want that kid,
but a breed of child could be intriguing.

91
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,717
I mean, what's so wrong with kids?

92
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,952
They're noisy, they're messy,
they're expensive.

93
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,394
Cheap, cheap.

94
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,789
They smell.

95
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,679
- They don't smell!
- Some smell.

96
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,955
- Give me a break!
- Babies smell.

97
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,196
- Cover the site!
- Cover up the dig!

98
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,475
- Tell them to shut down!
- Cut the machine!

99
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,310
Cover it all up. Pull it over.

100
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,516
Just cut it, will you? Shut it down!

101
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,149
What?

102
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,999
What the hell do you think
you're doing in here?

103
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,471
We were saving that.

104
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,356
For today, I guarantee it.

105
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,753
- Who in God's name do you think you are?
- John Hammond.

106
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,071
And I'm delighted to meet you finally
in person, Dr. Grant.

107
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,870
So, I can see that my $50,000 a year
has been well spent.

108
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,709
Who's the jerk?

109
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,076
- This is our paleobotanist. Dr...
- Sattler.

110
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,351
Ellie, this is Mr. Hammond.

111
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,678
I'm sorry about the dramatic entrance,
Dr. Sattler, but...

112
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,671
- Did I say "jerk"?
...we're in a hurry.

113
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,991
Will you have a drink?
We won't let it get warm. Sit down.

114
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,797
- Let me have this.
- I'll just get a glass or two. I can do it.

115
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,031
- There's samples all over here.
- I know my way around the kitchen.

116
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,951
Now, I'll get right to the point.

117
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,830
I like you. Both of you.

118
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,357
I can tell instantly about people. It's a gift.

119
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,358
I own an island off the coast of Costa Rica.

120
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,276
I've leased it from the government
and during the last five years...

121
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,749
...l've been setting up a biological preserve.

122
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,115
Really spectacular. Spared no expense.

123
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,510
Make the one I've got down in Kenya
look like a petting zoo.

124
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,593
And there's no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds.

125
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,912
- And what are those?
- Small versions of adults, honey.

126
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,877
And not just kids, everyone.

127
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,194
We're opening next year, if the lawyers
don't kill me first. Do you like lawyers?

128
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,879
- I don't really know any.
- Don't really know any.

129
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,830
I do, and there's a particular one right now,
who represents my investors.

130
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,799
Says that they insist on outside opinions.

131
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,438
What kind of opinions?

132
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,438
Well, your kind,
not to put too fine a point on it.

133
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,433
Let's face it, in your particular fields,
you're the top minds.

134
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,876
And if I could just persuade you...

135
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,357
...to sign off on the park,
give it your endorsement...

136
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,672
...maybe even pen a wee testimonial,
I could get back on schedule.

137
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,670
- Why would they care what we think?
- What kind of park is this?

138
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,758
It's right up your alley.

139
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,631
Why don't you come down,
just the pair of you, for the weekend?

140
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,757
I'd love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well.

141
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,589
I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.

142
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,710
I'm sorry. This isn't possible.

143
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,112
We just dug up a new skeleton...

144
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,079
I'd compensate you
by fully funding your dig...

145
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,079
- This is a very unusual time.
- The timing is...

146
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,390
...for a further three years.

147
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,519
Where's the plane?

148
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,035
- Okay.
- Three years.

149
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,109
Cheers.

150
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,875
Dodgson!

151
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,638
You shouldn't use my name.

152
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,319
Dodgson. We've got Dodgson here.

153
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,994
See, nobody cares. Nice hat.

154
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,319
What're you trying to look like,
a secret agent?

155
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,033
- Well?
- $750,000.

156
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,955
On delivery, $50,000 more
for each viable embryo.

157
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,952
That's $1.5 million
if you get all 15 species off the island.

158
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,109
I'll get them all.

159
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,954
Remember, viable embryos.
They're no use to us if they don't survive.

160
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,190
How am I supposed to transport them?

161
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,438
The bottom screws open.

162
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,631
That's great. Oh, my God.

163
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,154
It's cooled and compartmentalised inside.

164
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,636
- You guys. That's great.
- Customs can even check it if they want to.

165
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,039
- Let me see.
- Go on.

166
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,638
- There's enough coolant for 36 hours.
- No menthol?

167
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,838
The embryos have to be back here
in San José by then.

168
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,592
That's up to your guy on the boat.

169
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,195
7:00 tomorrow night on the east dock.
Make sure he gets it right.

170
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,108
- How are you planning to beat security?
- I've got an 18-minute window.

171
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,750
18 minutes and your company
catches up on 10 years of research.

172
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,871
Don't get cheap on me, Dodgson.

173
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,072
That was Hammond's mistake.

174
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,433
So you two dig up dinosaurs?

175
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,471
- Well...
- We try to.

176
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,915
You'll have to get used to Dr. Malcolm.

177
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,358
He suffers from a deplorable excess
of personality, for a mathematician.

178
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,317
Chaotician. Chaotician, actually.

179
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,118
John doesn't subscribe to chaos...

180
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,873
...particularly what it says
about his science project.

181
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,157
Lan, you've never been able to
sufficiently explain your concerns...

182
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,993
Because of the behaviour
of the system in phase space?

183
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,231
A load, if I may say so,
of fashionable number crunching...

184
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,475
Don't.

185
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,558
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant,
you've heard of Chaos Theory?

186
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,716
No.

187
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,558
No? Non-linear equations?

188
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,913
Strange attractors?

189
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,277
I refuse to believe that you aren't familiar
with the concept of attraction.

190
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,351
I bring scientists. You bring a rock star.

191
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,629
There it is.

192
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,951
Bad wind shears. We have to drop
pretty fast. Hold on, this will be thrilling.

193
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,200
But you need that piece over here,
and that piece...

194
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,919
We'll have landed
by the time you get it right.

195
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,309
Great.

196
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,680
The full 50 miles of perimeter fence
are in place?

197
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,832
And the concrete moats,
and the motion-sensor tracking systems.

198
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,992
Donald, dear boy, relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.

199
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,038
Let's get this straight.
This is not a weekend excursion.

200
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,078
This is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island.

201
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,152
Your investors, whom I represent,
are deeply concerned.

202
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,357
48 hours from now,
if they're not convinced, I'm not convinced.

203
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,112
I'll shut you down, John.

204
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,673
In 48 hours,
I'll be accepting your apologies.

205
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,835
All right, slow down. Slow. Stop.

206
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,393
This shouldn't be here.

207
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,319
Alan, this species of veriforman
has been extinct, since...

208
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,039
...the Cretaceous Period.
I mean, this thing...

209
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,394
What?

210
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,034
Look at that.

211
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,396
It's a dinosaur.

212
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,597
You did it. Crazy son of a bitch, you did it.

213
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,316
We could tear up the rule book
on cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply.

214
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,675
They're wrong.
This is a warm-blooded creature.

215
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,309
- This thing doesn't live in a swamp.
- This thing's got a 25, 27-foot neck?

216
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,834
- The Brachiosaurus? 30.
- 30 feet.

217
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,194
We're gonna make a fortune
with this place.

218
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,319
How fast are they?

219
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,512
Well, we clocked the T. Rex
at 32 miles an hour.

220
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,639
T. Rex?

221
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,551
You said you've got a T. Rex?

222
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,749
Say again.

223
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,034
We have a T. Rex.

224
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,990
Put your head between your knees.

225
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,594
Dr. Grant...

226
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,871
...my dear Dr. Sattler...

227
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,915
...welcome to Jurassic Park.

228
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,718
They're moving in herds.

229
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,393
They do move in herds.

230
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,678
How did you do this?

231
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,634
I'll show you.

232
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,678
G'day.

233
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,796
The most advanced amusement park
in the entire world...

234
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,714
...incorporating all the latest technologies.

235
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,951
And I'm not talking just about rides.
Everybody has rides.

236
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,079
No, we've made living
biological attractions so astounding...

237
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,596
...that they'll capture the imagination
of the entire planet.

238
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,672
So, what are you thinking?

239
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,718
- That we're out of a job.
- Don't you mean "extinct"?

240
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,314
Why don't you all sit down?
Donald, sit down.

241
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,118
Here he comes. Well, here I come.

242
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,555
<i>Hello</i>.

243
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,635
Say hello.

244
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,790
Hello.

245
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,235
<i>Hello, John</i>.

246
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,638
Yes, I've got lines.

247
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,030
<i>Well, fine, I guess</i>.
<i>But, how did I get here?</i>

248
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,836
Well, let me show you.
First, I'll need a drop of blood.

249
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,589
Your blood.

250
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,635
<i>Right</i>.

251
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,549
<i>That hurt</i>.

252
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,958
Relax, John.
It's all part of the miracle of cloning.

253
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,991
<i>Hello, John</i>.

254
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,833
Cloned from what? Loy extraction
hasn't recreated an intact DNA strand.

255
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,911
Not without massive sequence gaps.

256
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,752
Paleo DNA, from what source?

257
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,756
Where do you get 100 million-year-old
dinosaur blood?

258
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,549
<i>What? What?</i>

259
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,113
<i>Well, Mr. DNA, where did you come from?</i>

260
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,508
<i>From your blood</i>.

261
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,718
<i>Just one drop of your blood</i>
<i>contains billions of strands of DNA</i>...

262
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,190
...<i>the building blocks of life</i>.

263
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,391
<i>A DNA strand like me</i>
<i>is a blueprint for building a living thing</i>.

264
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,628
<i>And sometimes animals that went extinct</i>
<i>millions of years ago, like dinosaurs</i>...

265
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,635
...<i>left their blueprints behind for us to find</i>.
<i>We just had to know where to look</i>.

266
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,430
<i>100 million years ago,</i>
<i>there were mosquitoes just like today</i>.

267
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,711
<i>And just like today,</i>
<i>they fed on the blood of animals</i>.

268
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,357
<i>Even dinosaurs</i>.
<i>Sometimes, after biting a dinosaur</i>...

269
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:36,992
...<i>mosquitoes would land on the branch</i>
<i>of a tree and get stuck in the sap</i>.

270
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:42,030
<i>After a long time, the tree sap</i>
<i>would get hard and become fossilised</i>...

271
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,836
...<i>just like a dinosaur bone,</i>
<i>preserving the mosquito inside</i>.

272
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,956
<i>This fossilised tree sap,</i>
<i>which we call amber</i>...

273
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,358
...<i>waited for millions of years</i>
<i>with the mosquito inside</i>...

274
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,398
...<i>until Jurassic Park scientists came along</i>.

275
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,319
<i>Using sophisticated techniques,</i>
<i>they extract the preserved blood</i>...

276
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,552
...<i>from the mosquito,</i>
<i>and bingo: Dino DNA I</i>

277
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,758
<i>A full DNA strand contains</i>
<i>three billion genetic codes</i>.

278
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:17,279
<i>If we looked at screens like these</i>
<i>once a second for eight hours a day</i>...

279
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,353
...<i>it'd take two years</i>
<i>to look at the entire DNA strand</i>.

280
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,911
<i>It's that long</i>.
<i>Since it's so old, it's full of holes</i>.

281
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,080
<i>Now that's where our geneticists</i>
<i>take over</i>.

282
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,717
<i>Thinking machine super-computers</i>
<i>and gene sequencers</i>...

283
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,109
...<i>break down the strand in minutes</i>.

284
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,276
<i>And virtual-reality displays</i>...

285
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,397
...<i>show our geneticists the gaps</i>
<i>in the DNA sequence</i>.

286
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,349
<i>We used the complete DNA of a frog</i>...

287
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,194
...<i>to fill in the holes and complete the code</i>.

288
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,753
<i>Whewl And now,</i>
<i>we can make a baby dinosaur</i>.

289
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,349
This score is only temporary.
It all has very dramatic music, of course.

290
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,708
A march or something.
It hasn't been written yet.

291
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,279
And then, the tour moves on.

292
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,793
<i>Well, look here</i>.
<i>Those hard-working cowpokes</i>...

293
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,675
This is overwhelming, John.

294
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,674
Are these characters autoerotica?

295
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,394
No, we have no animatronics here.

296
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,592
Those people are the real miracle workers
of Jurassic Park.

297
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,952
...<i>in unfertilised emu or ostrich eggs</i>.

298
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,553
Wait a minute.
How do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?

299
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,234
- Can't we see the unfertilised eggs?
- Shortly.

300
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,074
<i>Now a whole team of genetic engineers</i>
<i>goes to work on</i>...

301
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,391
- Can't you stop these things?
- I'm sorry. It's kind of a ride.

302
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,357
One, two, three.

303
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,274
You can't do that.

304
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,516
- What?
- Can they do that?

305
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,112
<i>A reminder: The boat for the mainland</i>
<i>will be leaving at 19:00</i>.

306
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,910
<i>All personnel be at the dock</i>
<i>no later than 18:45. No exceptions</i>.

307
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,752
- G'day, Henry.
- Good day, sir.

308
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,673
It's turning the eggs.

309
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,079
Perfect timing. I'd hoped they'd hatch
before I had to go to the boat.

310
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,515
Henry, why didn't you tell me?

311
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,474
I insist on being here when they're born.

312
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,475
Come on.

313
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,793
Come on, little one.

314
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,912
Very good. Push.

315
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,870
- Very good.
- God.

316
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,269
Push. Come on.

317
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,638
Come on. Come on, then.

318
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,639
There you are. There.

319
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,359
They imprint on the first creature
they come in contact with.

320
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,598
Helps them to trust me.

321
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:26,040
I've been present for the birth
of every creature on this island.

322
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,112
Surely not the ones
that have bred in the wild.

323
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,430
Actually they can't breed in the wild.

324
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,239
Population control is one
of our security precautions.

325
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,153
There's no unauthorised breeding
in Jurassic Park.

326
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,430
How do you know they can't breed?

327
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,831
Because all the animals
in Jurassic Park are female.

328
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,195
We've engineered them that way.

329
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,839
There you are.

330
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,679
Oh, my God. Look at that.

331
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,390
Blood temperature seems like
about high 80s, maybe.

332
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,196
What?

333
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,713
- 91.
- 91.

334
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,950
Homeothermic? It holds that temperature?

335
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,109
Yes.

336
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:11,159
But, again, how do you know
they're all female?

337
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,153
What, does somebody go out in the park
and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?

338
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,596
We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.

339
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,989
All vertebrate embryos
are inherently female.

340
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,755
They just require an extra hormone
given at the right developmental stage...

341
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,909
...to make them male.

342
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,798
- We simply deny them that.
- Deny them that?

343
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,316
John, the kind of control
you're attempting is not possible.

344
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,278
If there's one thing the history
of evolution has taught us...

345
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,399
...it's that life will not be contained.
Life breaks free. Expands to new places...

346
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,116
...and it crashes through barriers,
painfully, maybe even dangerously...

347
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,794
...but there it is.

348
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,679
There it is.

349
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,954
You're implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed.

350
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:58,272
No, I'm simply saying that life finds a way.

351
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,957
What species is this?

352
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,518
It's a Velociraptor.

353
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:15,953
You bred Raptors?

354
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,588
Dr. Grant! As I was saying, we laid on
lunch for you before you go into the park.

355
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,592
- Our gourmet chef, Alejandro...
- What are they doing?

356
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,789
Feeding them.

357
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,668
Alejandro's prepared a delightful menu
for us. Chilean sea bass.

358
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,549
Shall we?

359
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,155
They should all be destroyed.

360
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,309
Robert Muldoon.

361
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,118
My game warden from Kenya.

362
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,078
Bit of an alarmist, but knows more
about Raptors than anyone.

363
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,832
What's their growth rate?

364
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,480
They're lethal at eight months,
and I do mean lethal.

365
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,996
I've hunted most things that can hunt you,
but how these things move...

366
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,991
- Fast for a biped?
- Cheetah speed.

367
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,992
50, 60 miles per hour
if they ever got out in the open.

368
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,798
And they're astonishing jumpers.

369
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,997
Yes. That's why we're taking
extreme precautions.

370
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,669
Do they show intelligence?

371
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,309
They show extreme intelligence.
Even problem-solving intelligence.

372
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,239
Especially the big one.

373
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,795
We bred eight originally,
but when she came in...

374
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,077
...she took over the pride
and killed all but two of the others.

375
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:20,553
That one, when she looks at you,
you can see she's working things out.

376
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,070
That's why we have to feed them like this.

377
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,072
She had them all attacking the fences
when the feeders came.

378
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,832
The fences are electrified, right?

379
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,878
That's right, but they never attack
the same place twice.

380
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,595
They were testing the fences
for weaknesses systematically.

381
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,393
They remember.

382
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,953
Yes. Well, who's hungry?

383
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,790
<i>More adventurous guests, of course,</i>
<i>can opt for our jungle river cruise</i>...

384
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,996
...<i>or for a close-up look at our majestic</i>...

385
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,436
None of these attractions are ready yet,
but the park will open...

386
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,672
...with the basic tour you are about to take,
and then other rides will come on-line...

387
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,230
...six or twelve months after that.
Absolutely spectacular designs.

388
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,471
- Spared no expense.
- And we can charge anything we want.

389
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,154
$2,000 a day, $10,000 a day,
and people will pay it.

390
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,993
- And there's the merchandise...
- Donald.

391
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,597
This park was not built to cater
only for the super rich.

392
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,558
Everyone in the world has the right
to enjoy these animals.

393
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,709
Sure. They will.

394
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,110
We'll have a coupon day or something.

395
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,398
The lack of humility before nature
that's being displayed here staggers me.

396
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,516
I think things are a little different
than you and I had feared.

397
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,113
I know. They're a lot worse.

398
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,317
Now, wait a second,
we haven't even seen the park yet...

399
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,118
Donald, let him talk. There's no reason,
I want to hear every viewpoint.

400
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,478
Don't you see the danger, John,
inherent in what you're doing here?

401
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,797
Genetic power's the most awesome force
the planet's ever seen...

402
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,633
...but you wield it like a kid
that's found his dad's gun.

403
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,076
- It's hardly appropriate to start hurling...
- lf I may.

404
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,755
I'll tell you the problem
with the scientific power you're using here.

405
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,469
It didn't require any discipline to attain it.

406
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,230
You read what others had done
and you took the next step.

407
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,430
You didn't earn the knowledge
for yourselves...

408
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,159
...so you don't take
any responsibility for it.

409
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,793
You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to
accomplish something as fast as you could.

410
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,793
Before you even knew what you had,
you patented it, and packaged it...

411
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,953
...and slapped it on a plastic lunch box,
and now you're selling it.

412
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,435
I don't think you're giving us
our due credit.

413
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,796
Our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before.

414
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,997
But your scientists were so preoccupied
with whether they could...

415
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,230
...they didn't stop to think if they should.

416
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,915
Condors.
Condors are on the verge of extinction.

417
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:56,433
If I created condors on this island,
you wouldn't have anything to say.

418
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,114
This isn't some species
that was obliterated...

419
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,192
...by deforestation or the building of a dam.

420
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,275
Dinosaurs had their shot
and nature selected them for extinction.

421
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,033
I don't understand this Luddite attitude.
Especially from a scientist.

422
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,830
How can we stand in the light of discovery
and not act?

423
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:21,435
What's so great about discovery?
It's a violent, penetrative act...

424
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,956
...that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery...

425
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,594
...I call the rape of the natural world.

426
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,274
The question is, how can you know
anything about an extinct eco-system?

427
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,238
How could you ever assume
that you can control it?

428
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,552
You have poisonous plants in this building.
You picked them because they look good.

429
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,679
But these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in...

430
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,638
...and they'll defend themselves.
Violently, if necessary.

431
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,988
Dr. Grant. If there's one person who
could appreciate what I am trying to do...

432
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,071
The world has just changed so radically
and we're all running to catch up.

433
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,117
I don't want to jump to any conclusions,
but dinosaurs and man...

434
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,233
...two species separated
by 65 million years of evolution...

435
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,630
...have just been suddenly
thrown back into the mix together.

436
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,918
How can we possibly have
the slightest idea what to expect?

437
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,116
I don't believe it.

438
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,351
You're meant to come here
and defend me against these characters...

439
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,750
...and the only one I've got on my side
is the blood-sucking lawyer.

440
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,675
Thank you.

441
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,668
They're here.

442
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,159
You four are gonna have a spot
of company out in the park.

443
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,913
Spend a little time
with our target audience.

444
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,035
Grandpa!

445
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,475
Kids!

446
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,676
- Wait! Careful with me.
- We missed you.

447
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,829
- We loved the presents. They were great.
- Did you enjoy the helicopter?

448
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:59,480
Yeah, it went down
and we all went right up.

449
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,677
Now, kids, come away.
Not too close to the cars.

450
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,032
Aren't they lovely?
Aren't they glorious, though.

451
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,509
These will be your transports
for the afternoon.

452
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,194
- No drivers?
- No, drivers. They're electric.

453
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,192
They run on this track
in the middle of the roadway here.

454
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:21,078
Totally non-polluting. Top of the line.
Spared no expense.

455
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,828
It's an interactive CD-ROM!

456
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,798
You touch the screen
and it talks about whatever you want.

457
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,838
Lex, you're all right in there.
Dr. Sattler, come with me.

458
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,751
Dr. Grant, come in the second car.

459
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,308
I'm gonna ride with, Dr. Sattler.

460
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,992
I read your book.

461
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,674
That's great.

462
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,115
Do you really think dinosaurs turned
into birds and that's where they went?

463
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,273
A few species may have evolved
along those lines.

464
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:05,355
They sure don't look like birds to me.

465
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,359
I heard that there was this meteor...

466
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,559
...hit the earth someplace down in Mexico
and made this big crater.

467
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,914
Listen...

468
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,800
...Tim, which car were you planning on?

469
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,878
Whichever one you are.

470
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,434
I heard about this thing in <i>Omni</i>
about this meteor making all this heat.

471
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,949
It made diamond dust
and that changed the weather.

472
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,598
They died because of the weather.

473
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,958
My teacher tells me about this book
by a guy named Bakker. He says...

474
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,150
She said I should ride with you
'cause it'd be good for you.

475
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,198
<i>The boat is now loading</i>.

476
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,796
<i>Everyone must be on the dock</i>
<i>for the 19:00 departure</i>.

477
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,953
National Weather Service
is tracking a tropical storm...

478
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,235
...about 75 miles west of us.

479
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,718
Why didn't I build in Orlando?

480
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,395
I'll keep an eye on it.
Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.

481
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,431
Start the tour program.

482
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,397
Hold onto your butts.

483
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,148
<i>And why did they put the fibreglass thing?</i>

484
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,670
<i>You want to join the future, right?</i>

485
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,115
<i>God help us when the hands of engineers</i>...

486
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,953
<i>During your tour,</i>
<i>the appropriate information will be</i>...

487
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,600
...<i>automatically selected</i>
<i>and displayed for you</i>.

488
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:56,195
<i>Simply touch the area of the screen</i>
<i>displaying the appropriate icon</i>.

489
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,508
Are we gonna hit that?

490
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,591
<i>Welcome to Jurassic Park</i>.

491
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,869
What have they got in there, King Kong?

492
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,440
The voice you're now hearing
is Richard Kiley.

493
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,034
We spared no expense.

494
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,519
<i>If you look to the right</i>...

495
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,720
...<i>you'll see a herd of the first dinosaurs</i>
<i>on our tour, called Dilophosaurus</i>.

496
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,156
- Dilophosaurus!
- Shit!

497
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,158
<i>One of the earliest carnivores</i>...

498
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,198
...<i>we now know Dilophosaurus</i>
<i>is actually poisonous</i>...

499
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,274
...<i>spitting its venom at its prey,</i>
<i>causing blindness and paralysis</i>...

500
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,392
...<i>allowing the carnivore</i>
<i>to eat at its leisure</i>.

501
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,549
<i>This makes Dilophosaurus a beautiful</i>
<i>but deadly addition</i>...

502
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,472
...<i>to Jurassic Park</i>.

503
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,753
Alan?

504
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,516
Damn.

505
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,470
Vehicle headlights are on
and not responding.

506
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,949
Those shouldn't be running off
of car batteries.

507
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,508
Item 151 on today's glitch list.

508
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,598
We have all the problems
of a major theme park and a zoo...

509
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,558
...and the computers
aren't even on their feet yet.

510
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,029
Our lives are in your hands
and you have butterfingers?

511
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,915
I am totally unappreciated in my time.

512
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:37,795
You can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to three days.

513
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,348
You think that kind of automation is easy?

514
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,636
Or cheap?

515
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,280
You know anyone
who can network eight machines...

516
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,194
...and de-bug two million lines of code
on my salary? If so, I want to see them.

517
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,512
Sorry about your financial problems,
I really am. But they are your problems.

518
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,955
You're absolutely right.
Everything's my problem.

519
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,319
I will not be drawn into another
financial debate with you. I really will not.

520
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,511
There's been hardly any debate at all.

521
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,558
I don't blame people for their mistakes.

522
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,270
But I do ask that they pay for them.

523
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,629
Thanks, Dad.

524
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,795
The headlights.

525
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:14,440
I'll de-bug the tour program
when they get back, okay?

526
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,637
Lt'll eat a lot of compute cycles.
We'll lose part of the system.

527
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,837
There's a small amount of memory,
you can't use it for everything.

528
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,912
- Are you gonna compile for a half an hour...
- Quiet, all of you!

529
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,596
They're approaching
the Tyrannosaur paddock.

530
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,956
God creates dinosaurs.
God destroys dinosaurs.

531
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:24,956
God creates man. Man destroys God.
Man creates dinosaurs.

532
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,874
Dinosaurs eat man.

533
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,911
Woman inherits the earth.

534
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,272
<i>We'll try to tempt the Rex now</i>.
<i>Keep watching the fence</i>.

535
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,797
What's going to happen to the goat?

536
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,598
He's going to eat the goat?

537
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,239
Excellent.

538
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,397
What's the matter, kid?
You never had lamb chops?

539
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,150
I happen to be a vegetarian.

540
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,913
T. Rex doesn't want to be fed.
He wants to hunt.

541
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:25,716
Can't just suppress 65 million years
of gut instinct.

542
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,715
<i>Eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs</i>
<i>on your dinosaur tour, right?</i>

543
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,190
<i>Hello. Yes?</i>

544
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,671
I really hate that man.

545
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:09,276
The Tyrannosaur doesn't obey
any set patterns or park schedules.

546
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,197
The essence of chaos.

547
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,477
I'm still not clear on chaos.

548
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,834
It simply deals with unpredictability
in complex systems.

549
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,231
The shorthand is the Butterfly Effect.

550
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,436
A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking...

551
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,239
...and in Central Park
you get rain instead of sunshine.

552
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,511
- Was I going too fast?
- I missed it.

553
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,555
I did a fly-by.

554
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,279
Give me that glass of water.
We'll conduct an experiment.

555
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,352
The car should be still. But that's okay.
It's just an example.

556
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:42,189
Put your hand flat like a hieroglyphic.

557
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,718
A drop of water falls on your hand.

558
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,314
Which way will the drop roll off?
Which finger?

559
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,119
Thumb, I'd say.

560
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,358
Freeze your hand. Don't move.

561
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:56,552
I'll do the same thing,
start with the same place again.

562
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,039
Which way, now?

563
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,953
Let's say back the same way.

564
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,515
It changed. Why?

565
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,875
Because tiny variations...

566
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,709
...the orientation of the hairs
on your hands...

567
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,074
Alan, look at this.

568
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,869
...the amount of blood distending
your vessels, imperfections in the skin...

569
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,269
- "lmperfections in the skin"?
- Just microscopic.

570
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:21,796
...never repeat and vastly effect
the outcome. That's...

571
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,836
...what?
- Unpredictability.

572
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,472
There. Look at this. See? I'm right again.

573
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,832
Nobody could predict that Dr. Grant
would jump out of a moving vehicle.

574
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,235
And there's another example.

575
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,958
See, here I am now by myself,
talking to myself. That's Chaos Theory.

576
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,838
Stop the program.

577
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,709
I told you how many times we needed
locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors.

578
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,439
<i>Stopping park vehicles</i>
<i>and rebooting program</i>.

579
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,075
<i>We're on. Will notify for resume</i>.

580
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,391
I'll switch it over to TelePrompTer.

581
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,438
- What about the circuit integrities?
- Screen says faulty sensor.

582
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,590
- I'll call security.
- We're at full go on that and it looks good.

583
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,832
Like I said, there's this other book
by a guy named Bakker...

584
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,115
...and he says dinosaurs died
from diseases.

585
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,397
- Where are we going?
- He didn't say they turned into birds.

586
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,516
Anyone else think
we shouldn't be out here?

587
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,273
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Like this.

588
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,999
- Really?
- Yours was fully illustrated.

589
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,714
You okay?

590
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,115
Look at this. Wait. Watch.

591
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,592
Come on. Watch this.

592
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,559
Everybody stay here.

593
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,156
- Okay?
- Of course.

594
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:09,635
Don't be scared. Come on, it's okay.
Muldoon tranquillised her for me.

595
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,948
She's sick.

596
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,833
Oh, my God.

597
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,875
She was always my favourite
when I was a kid...

598
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,191
...and now I see
she's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.

599
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,679
It's okay.

600
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,148
Microvesicles. That's interesting.

601
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,275
Thanks. What are her symptoms?

602
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,479
Lmbalance, disorientation,
laboured breathing.

603
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,710
It seems to happen every six weeks or so.

604
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,119
Six weeks.

605
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,758
- These are dilated.
- They are?

606
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:27,400
- Take a look.
- I'll be damned.

607
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,795
That's pharmacological.
From local plant life.

608
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,956
Is this West Indian lilac?

609
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,790
Yes. We know they're toxic,
but the animals don't eat them.

610
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,759
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.

611
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,350
There's only one way to be positive.

612
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,434
I'd have to see the dinosaur's droppings.

613
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,552
Dino droppings? Droppings?

614
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:09,838
Yeah, I got that.

615
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,272
That storm centre hasn't dissipated
or changed course.

616
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,710
We're gonna have to cut the tour short.

617
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,718
We'll pick it up again tomorrow.

618
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,917
- Are you sure we have to?
- It's not worth taking the chance.

619
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,470
- Sustained winds at 45 knots.
- Tell them when they get back in the cars.

620
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:30,031
Ladies and gentlemen last shuttle leaving
for the dock leaves in five minutes.

621
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,350
Drop what you're doing and leave now.

622
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,875
Damn.

623
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,831
That is one big pile of shit.

624
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,394
You're right.
There's no trace of lilac berries.

625
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,436
That's so odd, though.

626
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,031
All right,
she's suffering from Melia toxicity...

627
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,195
...every six weeks.

628
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,150
Let's see, rats.

629
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,753
She's tenacious.

630
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,638
You have no idea.

631
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,394
You will remember to wash your hands
before you eat anything?

632
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,874
Doctors, if you please,
I have to insist that we get moving.

633
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,636
I'd like to stay with Dr. Harding
and finish up with the Trike.

634
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,078
Sure. I'm in a gas-powered jeep.

635
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,799
I'll drop her off at the centre
before I make the boat.

636
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,599
Great. Then I'll catch up with you later.

637
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,590
You sure?

638
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,353
Yeah, I want to stay
with her a little longer.

639
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,793
Okay, then.

640
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,834
<i>There's nothing I can do</i>.
<i>The captain says we have to go, we go</i>.

641
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,838
You've got to give me time.

642
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,435
I did a test run, it took me 20 minutes.
I think I can push it to 18 but...

643
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,556
...you've got to give me
at least 15 minutes.

644
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:22,914
<i>No promises</i>.

645
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,828
Visitor vehicles are returning
to the garage.

646
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:40,074
So much for our first tour.
Two no-shows and one sick Triceratops.

647
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,639
It could've been worse.

648
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,268
A lot worse.

649
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,313
Anybody want a soda or something?
I'm going up to the machine.

650
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,470
I thought maybe
I'd get somebody something.

651
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:55,155
I've had only sweets
and I'm gonna get something salty.

652
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,110
I finished de-bugging the phones.

653
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:01,316
I was going to, so I did.

654
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,074
So I de-bugged the phones.
And I thought maybe...

655
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:07,199
...I should tell you the system
will be compiling...

656
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,033
...for 18 to 20 minutes,
so some of the minor systems...

657
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,590
...they might go on and off for a while,
but it's nothing to worry about.

658
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,073
- Do you have any kids?
- Me? Hell, yeah. Three. I love kids.

659
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,235
Anything at all can and does happen.

660
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,109
Same with wives, for that matter.

661
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,875
- You're married?
- Occasionally.

662
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:55,038
I'm always on the lookout
for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.

663
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,349
Five, four...

664
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,235
- That's odd.
- What?

665
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,550
Door security systems are shutting down.

666
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,952
Nedry said a few systems
would go off-line, didn't he?

667
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,552
By the way, Dr. Sattler...

668
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,956
...she's not, like, available, is she?
- Why?

669
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,433
- I'm sorry. You two are...
- Yeah.

670
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,275
- What'd I touch?
- You didn't touch anything. We stopped.

671
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,438
What the hell?

672
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,398
- What now?
- Fences are failing all over the park.

673
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,870
Find Nedry. Check the vending machines.

674
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,471
Just look at this work station.

675
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,916
- What a complete slob.
- The Raptor fences aren't out, are they?

676
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,312
No, no. They're still on.

677
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,274
Why the hell would he turn
the other ones off?

678
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,312
Access main program.

679
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,712
Access main security.

680
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:32,078
Access main program grid.

681
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,831
<i>You didn't say the magic word</i>.

682
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,630
Please! Goddamn it.
I hate this hacker crap.

683
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,877
Phone Nedry's people in Cambridge.

684
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,679
Phones are out, too.

685
00:57:57,080 --> 00:57:58,672
Where did the vehicles stop?

686
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,313
Their radio's out, too.

687
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,070
- Gennaro said to stay put.
- Kids okay?

688
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,310
I didn't ask. Why wouldn't they be?

689
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,038
- Kids get scared.
- What's scary?

690
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,078
- It's just a little hiccup in the power.
- I'm not scared.

691
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:32,156
- I didn't say you were scared.
- I know.

692
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,870
Hey, where did you find those?

693
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,594
- In the box, under my seat.
- Are they heavy?

694
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,600
- Yeah.
- Then they're expensive. Put them back.

695
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,993
Don't scare me.

696
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,798
Cool. Night vision.

697
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,439
Did you feel that?

698
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,514
Maybe it's the power
trying to come back on.

699
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,268
What is that?

700
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,039
Where's the goat?

701
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,309
Jesus!

702
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,718
He left us.

703
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:11,712
- Where does he think he's going?
- When you gotta go, you gotta go.

704
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,308
Dr. Grant.

705
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:44,716
I hate being right all the time.

706
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:57,793
Keep absolutely still.
Its vision is based on movement.

707
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:12,719
Turn the light off.

708
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,839
Turn the light off!

709
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:15,153
- Hurry! Turn it off!
- I'm sorry!

710
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,071
You're the one who turned it...

711
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,114
lan, freeze!

712
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,953
Get the kids!

713
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,110
- Get rid of the flare!
- Get the kids!

714
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,593
Get rid of the flare!

715
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,192
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord be...

716
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:12,914
Dr. Grant!

717
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,828
I'm stuck. The seat's got my feet.

718
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,115
I'll get you next. You're okay.

719
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:24,759
You're all right.

720
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:26,993
Tim. Tim!

721
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:33,358
Don't move.
He can't see us if we don't move.

722
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,071
Lex! Lex, you're choking me.

723
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:41,994
Grab the wire.

724
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:04,629
"Keycheck space minus 0.
Keychecks off, safety space minus 0."

725
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:07,832
He's turning the safety systems off.
Doesn't want anybody to see.

726
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:10,992
Look at this next entry.
It's the kicker. "White rabbit object."

727
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,948
It did it all. With the keychecks off,
the computer didn't file the keystrokes.

728
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:18,589
The way to find them is to check
the computer's lines of code one by one.

729
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,757
- How many lines of code are there?
- About two million.

730
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,353
- Two million?
- Yeah.

731
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:30,716
Robert, I wonder if perhaps you would
be good enough to take a gas jeep...

732
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,390
...and bring back my grandchildren.

733
01:07:35,240 --> 01:07:36,229
Sure.

734
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:40,473
I'm going with him.

735
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:44,669
John.

736
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,756
I can't get Jurassic Park back on-line
without Dennis Nedry.

737
01:08:13,080 --> 01:08:14,195
Damn it!

738
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,993
There's the road!

739
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:32,159
Winch this sucker off the thing
and then I tie it to the that thing there.

740
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:35,516
I'll pull down this thing here,
and pull it back up again.

741
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:46,790
My glasses. I can afford more glasses!

742
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,997
You've got time. You can do it.
Do it. Come on, Dennis.

743
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:26,109
Hello.

744
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,713
Yeah, that's nice. I've got to go.

745
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:45,754
Nice boy.

746
01:09:46,160 --> 01:09:47,195
Nice boy.

747
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,318
Nice dinosaur.

748
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:53,396
Thought you were one of your big brothers.
You're not so bad.

749
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,234
What do you want? A little food?
Look at me. I just fell down a hill.

750
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:00,676
I'm soaking wet. I don't have any food.
I have nothing on me.

751
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,116
Go on. Play fetch?

752
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,349
Look, stick.

753
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:11,030
Look at stick.

754
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:14,478
Stick, stupid.
Fetch the stick, boy. Look at the stick.

755
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,430
You like the stick? Go on and get it.

756
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,352
No wonder you're extinct.

757
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,710
I'm gonna run you over
when I come back down.

758
01:11:36,040 --> 01:11:37,553
Timmy!

759
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,436
Now, Lex. Listen.

760
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,712
Lex, I'm right here.

761
01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:48,715
I'll look after you.
I have to help your brother.

762
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:50,956
Stay right here and wait for me.

763
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:53,550
He left us.

764
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,429
But that's not what I'm going to do.

765
01:11:58,400 --> 01:11:59,389
Okay?

766
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:02,949
Stay here.

767
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:30,911
You hear me? I'm coming up.

768
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:35,388
I hate climbing. I hate trees, way too high.

769
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:03,555
You okay?

770
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:07,634
I threw up.

771
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:11,789
That's okay.

772
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,358
Just give me your hand.

773
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:22,239
Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up.
Just give me your hand.

774
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,194
Here, I've got you.

775
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:34,909
Okay.

776
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:39,115
- That's good. Over the rail.
- Don't pull me too hard.

777
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:45,630
Stand on the door. Hang on to me.

778
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,714
- That's not too bad, right, Timmy?
- Yes, it is.

779
01:13:51,800 --> 01:13:54,394
It's like a tree house.
Your dad ever build you one?

780
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,959
- No.
- Yeah, me, too.

781
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:00,233
The thing about climbing is,
you never look down.

782
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,833
This is impossible.

783
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:06,193
- How am I going to do this? It's about...
- I'm going to help you with your footing.

784
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,709
Tim, go.

785
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,799
Go, Tim, go!

786
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:44,909
Faster, Tim!

787
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,429
Tim, jump!

788
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,315
Go, Tim.

789
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,749
We're back in the car again.

790
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,871
At least you're out of the tree.

791
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,598
Where's the other car?

792
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:22,835
Alan!

793
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:25,114
Dr. Grant!

794
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,876
- I think this was Gennaro.
- I think this was, too.

795
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:49,754
- I think it's ahead of us.
- It could be anywhere.

796
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,071
With fences down,
it can wander in and out of any paddock.

797
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,711
He's put a tourniquet on. Lan.

798
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,954
Remind me to thank John
for a lovely weekend.

799
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,432
Can we chance moving him?

800
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:15,119
Please chance it.

801
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,833
Ellie, come on!

802
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,115
The other car!

803
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:35,034
Dr. Grant?

804
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,793
They're not here.

805
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,393
Anybody hear that?

806
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:16,149
It's an impact tremor, is what it is.

807
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,718
I'm fairly alarmed here.

808
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:22,680
Come on. We've got to get out of here.
Now!

809
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:25,475
Let's go.

810
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,708
Must go faster.

811
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,999
Here it comes! Stand on it! Fifth gear!

812
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:52,072
- Get off the stick! Bloody move!
- Look out!

813
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:20,310
Think they'll have that on the tour?

814
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,673
Are you hearing this?

815
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,070
Come on, Tim. Hurry up.

816
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,638
Let's get up this tree.

817
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:46,119
Come on, Tim, it's okay.
Listen. Try up here.

818
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,554
I hate trees.

819
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:55,670
- They don't bother me.
- Yeah? Well, you weren't in the last one.

820
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,990
Look at the Brontosauruses.
I mean, Brachiosaurus.

821
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,833
They're singing.

822
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,632
Don't let the monsters come here.

823
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:48,996
They're not monsters, they're animals.
These are herbivores.

824
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:52,471
They only eat vegetables.
For you, I think they'd make an exception.

825
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,152
I hate the other kind.

826
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,833
The other kind just do what they do.

827
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:19,269
What's that?

828
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,909
What are you and Ellie going to do,
if you don't dig up bones anymore?

829
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,634
I don't know.

830
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:34,149
I guess we'll just have to evolve, too.

831
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,796
What do you call a blind dinosaur?

832
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:44,996
- What do you call a blind dinosaur?
- "Do-you-think-he-saurus."

833
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,509
What do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?

834
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,435
You got me.

835
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,671
A "Do-you-think-he-saurus' Rex."

836
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:00,191
- Alan?
- Yeah?

837
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,037
What if the dinosaurs come back
while we're all asleep?

838
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:08,356
- I'll stay awake.
- All night?

839
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:11,909
All night.

840
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:01,678
They were all melting.

841
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:08,232
Malcolm's okay for now.
I gave him a shot of morphine.

842
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:13,439
They'll all be fine.

843
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,518
Who better to get the children through
Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

844
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,518
You know, the first...

845
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:29,030
...attraction I ever built
when I came down from Scotland...

846
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:33,029
...was a flea circus, Petticoat Lane.

847
01:22:34,360 --> 01:22:36,078
Really quite wonderful.

848
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:39,757
I had a wee trapeze and a...

849
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:43,989
...carousel...

850
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,113
...and a seesaw.

851
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:52,316
They all move motorised, of course.

852
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:55,234
People said they saw the fleas.
"I can see the fleas.

853
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,992
"Can't you see the fleas?"

854
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:01,838
Clown fleas, high-wire fleas,
and fleas on parade.

855
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:09,119
With this place...

856
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:14,471
...I wanted to show them something
that wasn't an illusion.

857
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:18,432
Something that was real.
Something that they could...

858
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:22,839
...see and touch.

859
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,709
An aim not devoid of merit.

860
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:37,510
But you can't think through this one, John.
You have to feel it.

861
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,312
You're absolutely right.

862
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,235
Hiring Nedry was a mistake,
that's obvious.

863
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,954
We're overdependent on automation,
I can see that now.

864
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:50,554
Next time, everything's correctable.

865
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:54,392
Creation is an act of sheer will.

866
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:58,517
Next time, it'll be flawless.

867
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:02,277
It's still the flea circus. It's all an illusion.

868
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:03,833
When we have control...

869
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,480
You've never had control!
That's the illusion.

870
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,200
I was overwhelmed
by the power of this place.

871
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:11,913
I made a mistake, too.

872
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:15,669
I didn't have enough respect
for that power, and it's out now.

873
01:24:18,200 --> 01:24:21,237
The only thing that matters now
are the people we love.

874
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,356
Alan, Lex, and Tim.

875
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:29,912
John, they're out there,
where people are dying.

876
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:47,349
It's good.

877
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,559
Spared no expense.

878
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,837
- Go away!
- It's okay. It's a Brachiosaurus.

879
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:25,040
It's a "Veggie-saurus", Lex.
"Veggie-saurus."

880
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:26,549
Veggie.

881
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,318
Come on. Come on, girl.

882
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:34,679
Come on, baby.

883
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,273
I'm not letting go.

884
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:56,439
- It looks like it has a cold.
- Yeah. Maybe.

885
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,358
- Can I touch it?
- Sure.

886
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:01,592
Just think of it as kind of a big cow.

887
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:05,989
I like cows.

888
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:17,870
Come on, girl. Come on up here, girl.

889
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,234
God bless you.

890
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:35,158
Great. Now she'll never try anything new.

891
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,592
She'll sit in her room, never come out,
play on her computer.

892
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:41,353
- I'm a hacker.
- That's what I said. You're a nerd.

893
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:44,557
I am not a computer nerd.
I prefer to be called a hacker.

894
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:45,829
God.

895
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,158
You know what this is?

896
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,911
It's a dinosaur egg.

897
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,672
The dinosaurs are breeding.

898
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:06,633
But my grandpa said
all the dinosaurs were girls.

899
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:10,110
- Amphibian DNA.
- What's that?

900
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:18,675
The film said they used frog DNA
to fill in the gene-sequence gaps.

901
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:21,911
They mutated the dinosaur genetic code.

902
01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:25,070
And blended it with that of frogs.

903
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:32,158
Some West African frogs have been known
to change sex from male to female...

904
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:34,196
...in a single sex environment.

905
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,599
Malcolm was right.

906
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:39,949
Look.

907
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:49,998
Life found a way.

908
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:57,034
That's crazy. You're out of your mind.
He's absolutely out of his mind.

909
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,396
Wait. What exactly would this mean?

910
01:27:59,480 --> 01:28:03,189
We're talking about a calculated risk,
which is the only option left to us.

911
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:07,512
We'll never find the command Nedry used.
He's covered his tracks far too well.

912
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:10,759
I think it's obvious now
that he's not coming back.

913
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:15,197
- So, shutting down the entire system...
- Get somebody else. I won't do it.

914
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:20,274
Shutting down the system is the only way
to wipe out everything he did.

915
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:24,756
Now, as I understand it,
all the systems will then come back...

916
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:27,514
...on their original start-up mode. Correct?

917
01:28:28,040 --> 01:28:30,918
Theoretically, yes.
We've never shut down before.

918
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,878
- It may not come back on.
- Would we get the phones back?

919
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,518
Yes, again, in theory.

920
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:39,396
What about the lysine contingency?
We could put that into effect.

921
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,199
- What's that?
- That's absolutely out of the question.

922
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,999
The lysine contingency
prevents the spread of animals...

923
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:46,877
...if they ever get off the island.

924
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,475
Wu inserted a gene that creates
a faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.

925
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:53,358
The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid, lysine.

926
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:57,035
Unless they're supplied with lysine by us,
they slip into a coma and die.

927
01:28:57,120 --> 01:28:59,475
People are dying.

928
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:05,795
Will you please shut down the system?

929
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:28,512
Hold on to your butts.

930
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,669
It's okay.

931
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,360
Look, see that? It's on. It worked.

932
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:56,035
What do you mean it worked?
Everything's off.

933
01:29:56,120 --> 01:30:00,079
Shutdown tripped the circuit breakers.
Turn them back on, reboot a few systems:

934
01:30:00,160 --> 01:30:03,391
Telephones, security doors,
half dozen others, but it worked.

935
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,789
- System's ready.
- Where are the breakers?

936
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:07,518
The shed at end of the compound.

937
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,239
Three minutes, I'll have the power back on
in the park.

938
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,278
Just to be safe, I want everybody
in the emergency bunker...

939
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:16,557
...until Mr. Arnold returns,
and the whole system's running again.

940
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,876
- I'm tired. I'm hot.
- I'm dirty.

941
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:23,355
Looking at the map,
I'd say the visitor's centre is just a mile...

942
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,718
...over that rise there.

943
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:30,989
What is that?

944
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:35,756
Tim, can you tell me what they are?

945
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:43,714
Gallimimus.

946
01:30:43,800 --> 01:30:46,189
Are those meat-eating?

947
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:48,988
"Meat-asauruses"?

948
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:56,155
Look at the wheeling.
Uniform direction changes.

949
01:30:56,240 --> 01:30:58,834
Just like a flock of birds
evading a predator.

950
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:03,272
They're flocking this way.

951
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,596
- I want to go now.
- Just look how it eats.

952
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:47,669
Please.

953
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,639
I bet you'll never look at birds
the same way again.

954
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:52,711
- Yes.
- Go now.

955
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,040
Okay. Keep low and follow me.

956
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,078
Look how much blood.

957
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,236
God. Something went wrong.

958
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:09,470
Something's happened.
Something's wrong.

959
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:13,593
This is just a delay.

960
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:16,638
That's all it is.
All major theme parks have delays.

961
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:21,032
When they opened Disneyland in 1956,
nothing worked.

962
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:24,989
If the Pirates of the Caribbean
breaks down, the pirates don't eat tourists.

963
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:29,756
I can't wait any more. Something's wrong.
I'm gonna go get the power back on.

964
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:32,998
You can't just stroll down the road,
you know.

965
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:36,311
Don't let's be too hasty.
I mean, he's only been gone...

966
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:40,836
- I'm going with you.
- Okay.

967
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:56,829
Sorry.

968
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:04,753
Now, this isn't going to be just like
switching on the kitchen light.

969
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:08,111
But I think I can follow this
and then talk you through it.

970
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:13,475
Right.

971
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,236
It ought to be me, really, going.

972
01:33:21,320 --> 01:33:24,039
- Why?
- I'm a... And you're a...

973
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:27,710
- Look.
- Come on, let's go.

974
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,917
We can discuss sexism
in survival situations when I get back.

975
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,470
You just take me through this step by step.
I'm on Channel 2.

976
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:12,599
The shutdown must've turned off
all the fences.

977
01:34:13,200 --> 01:34:16,715
Damn it, even Nedry knew better
than to mess with the Raptor pen.

978
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:23,555
Come on, this way.

979
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,637
I can see the shed from here.

980
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,512
We can make it if we run.

981
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:37,274
No. We can't.

982
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:39,149
Why not?

983
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:41,757
Because we're being hunted.

984
01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:44,951
In the bushes, straight ahead.

985
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:48,708
It's all right.

986
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,599
Like hell it is.

987
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:54,917
Run. Towards the shed.

988
01:34:57,040 --> 01:34:58,439
I've got her.

989
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,793
Go. Now!

990
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:20,519
Mr. Arnold?

991
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:26,834
John, I'm in.

992
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:28,310
<i>Great</i>.

993
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:33,156
Ahead of you is a metal staircase.
Go down it.

994
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:36,355
<i>Okay. Going down</i>.

995
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:40,994
After 20 or 30 feet
you come to a T-junction. Take a left.

996
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:44,072
- Have her follow the main cable.
- I know how to read a schematic.

997
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:15,116
I guess that means the power's off.

998
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,354
- That's not funny.
- That was great.

999
01:36:32,760 --> 01:36:34,591
Well, maybe we, we could...

1000
01:36:51,720 --> 01:36:54,109
Damn it. Dead end.

1001
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:55,674
Wait a minute.

1002
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:00,311
There should have been a right turn
back there somewhere.

1003
01:37:01,240 --> 01:37:02,150
Look above you.

1004
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:07,309
<i>There should be a bundle of cable and</i>
<i>pipes all heading in the same direction</i>.

1005
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:08,515
Follow that.

1006
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:11,230
Okay. Following the piping.

1007
01:37:13,800 --> 01:37:18,078
I bet I could climb over to the other side
before you could even get to the top.

1008
01:37:18,160 --> 01:37:20,390
- What would you give me?
- Respect.

1009
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:23,276
Come on, guys, it's not a race.

1010
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,074
I see the box.

1011
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,398
It says, "High Voltage."

1012
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:34,555
Okay.

1013
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,040
Good. Here we go.

1014
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:42,829
Over the top.

1015
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:44,998
Take your time.

1016
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:46,915
Good. Come on.

1017
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:49,471
Find your footing.

1018
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:54,234
You can't throw the main switch by hand.

1019
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:57,596
You've got to pump up the primer handle
in order to get the charge.

1020
01:37:57,680 --> 01:37:59,910
It's large, flat and grey.

1021
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:02,511
All right, here I go. Okay?

1022
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:09,034
One, two, three, four.

1023
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:10,878
Okay, charged.

1024
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:15,189
Under the words "Contact Position,"
there's a round green button...

1025
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:17,710
...which says "Push to Close."

1026
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:19,992
Push to close.

1027
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,315
Push it.

1028
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:42,708
The red buttons turn on
the individual park systems.

1029
01:38:43,560 --> 01:38:44,675
Switch them on.

1030
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:57,956
- Get down now!
- You're gonna have to jump.

1031
01:38:58,040 --> 01:38:59,712
You crazy? I'm not gonna jump.

1032
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:02,394
- Do what Dr. Grant says!
- Let go. I'll count to three.

1033
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,789
One, two, three!

1034
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:10,392
I'm coming up to get you.

1035
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:11,913
I've got to get Tim.

1036
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:13,992
Okay. I'm gonna count to three.

1037
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,435
One...

1038
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:20,355
...two...

1039
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,115
He's not breathing.

1040
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:39,435
I think we're back in business!

1041
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:16,354
Clever girl.

1042
01:41:39,680 --> 01:41:40,669
No, Tim!

1043
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:45,357
Good boy.

1044
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:50,909
Three.

1045
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:56,915
Hello?

1046
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:10,350
I'm gonna have to find the others.

1047
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,639
Get you to a doctor.

1048
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:17,795
- Lex, you look after Tim.
- Yeah.

1049
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:20,917
Your hair is all sticking up.

1050
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:25,035
Big Tim, the human piece of toast.

1051
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:31,230
I'll be back soon. I promise.

1052
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:58,395
Run.

1053
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:13,711
Just the two Raptors, right?

1054
01:44:15,160 --> 01:44:16,957
You sure the third one's contained?

1055
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:20,476
Yes, unless they figure out
how to open doors.

1056
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:49,037
- What is it?
- It's a Velociraptor.

1057
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:53,153
It's inside.

1058
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:18,715
Follow me.

1059
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:49,114
It's in there.

1060
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:51,154
Control room.

1061
01:47:57,240 --> 01:48:00,391
- We can call for help?
- We've got to reboot the system first.

1062
01:48:03,120 --> 01:48:04,269
The door locks!

1063
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:07,196
Ellie, boot up the door locks!

1064
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:18,072
No, boot up the door locks!

1065
01:48:19,080 --> 01:48:22,755
- Get back! Boot up the door locks.
- You can't hold it by yourself!

1066
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:34,196
It's a UNIX system. I know this.

1067
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:36,911
It's all the files of the whole park.

1068
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,117
It tells you everything.
I've got to find the right file.

1069
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:42,353
Try to reach the gun.

1070
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,397
I can't get it unless I move.

1071
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:10,028
This is it. This might be the right file.

1072
01:49:25,040 --> 01:49:26,553
- You got it!
- Yes!

1073
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:37,829
What works?

1074
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:40,514
All security systems are enabled.
We got it!

1075
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:50,830
Grant.

1076
01:49:51,240 --> 01:49:54,038
Mr. Hammond, the phones are working.

1077
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:57,239
- The children all right?
- <i>The children are fine</i>.

1078
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:00,831
Call the mainland.
Tell 'em to send the damn helicopters.

1079
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,558
It's gonna cut through the glass!

1080
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:56,750
Move!

1081
01:52:55,120 --> 01:52:59,238
After careful consideration,
I've decided not to endorse your park.

1082
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,149
So have I.

1083
