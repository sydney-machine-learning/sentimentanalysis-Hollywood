1
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:52,290
The coffin.

2
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:56,692
- It has your initials: JB.
- At this moment, rather him than me.

3
00:00:58,574 --> 00:01:01,646
At least you've been saved
the effort of removing him.

4
00:01:01,774 --> 00:01:04,163
Colonel Bouvar passed away in his sleep.

5
00:01:05,894 --> 00:01:09,443
You sound disappointed
you did not kill him yourself?

6
00:01:09,574 --> 00:01:12,566
I am. Jacques Bouvar
murdered two of my colleagues.

7
00:01:20,054 --> 00:01:24,172
Is there anything else our French station
can do for Monsieur Bond?

8
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:26,250
Later, perhaps.

9
00:01:36,334 --> 00:01:38,290
As I said: later.

10
00:01:38,414 --> 00:01:40,370
Come on.

11
00:02:19,334 --> 00:02:20,926
Madame.

12
00:02:21,054 --> 00:02:24,364
I've come to offer
my sincere condolences.

13
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:30,292
My dear Colonel Bouvar, you shouldn't
have opened that car door yourself.

14
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,973
No well-dressed man
should be without one.

15
00:04:14,094 --> 00:04:16,483
- Yes, very practical.
- Get inside.

16
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:20,650
Hurry!

17
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:54,286
He always runs while others walk

18
00:04:57,096 --> 00:05:04,491
He acts while other menjust talk

19
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:14,770
He looks at this world and wants it all

20
00:05:16,496 --> 00:05:24,335
So he strikes... Iike Thunderball

21
00:05:27,056 --> 00:05:34,371
He knows the meaning ofsuccess

22
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:43,812
His needs are more, so he gives less

23
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:53,765
They call him the winner who takes all

24
00:05:55,496 --> 00:06:03,130
And he strikes... Iike Thunderball

25
00:06:05,696 --> 00:06:12,568
Any woman he wants, he'll get

26
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:23,451
He will break any heart without regret

27
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:31,886
His days ofasking are all gone

28
00:06:33,896 --> 00:06:41,132
His fight goes on and on and on

29
00:06:43,176 --> 00:06:49,968
But he thinks that the fight is worth it all

30
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:54,731
So he strikes

31
00:06:54,856 --> 00:07:06,165
Like Thunderball

32
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:41,491
Hey, no parking here!

33
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:44,171
Oh, pardon, Monsieur Largo.

34
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:57,448
The lnternational Brotherhood
for Assistance of Stateless Persons

35
00:07:57,575 --> 00:07:59,531
is purely philanthropic.

36
00:07:59,655 --> 00:08:01,850
Our interest is your rehabilitation.

37
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:06,173
We have arranged for visas
with the Brazilian Consulate.

38
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:08,763
- Good morning, Mr Largo.
- Good morning.

39
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:11,967
- Nice to have you back again.
- Thank you, my dear.

40
00:08:12,095 --> 00:08:15,053
- We pay back everything.
- There will be no need.

41
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:18,850
We have funds from private individuals
who share our aim.

42
00:08:18,975 --> 00:08:21,330
There are just one or two formalities...

43
00:08:38,815 --> 00:08:40,771
Sit down, Number Two.

44
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:44,012
We will discuss your NATO project later.

45
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:49,364
I regret to inform you all
of the death of SPECTRE Number Six.

46
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:53,090
Colonel Jacques Bouvar
was killed by an unknown assassin.

47
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:55,490
His services will be greatly missed.

48
00:08:56,695 --> 00:09:00,131
We will now hear
the area financial reports. Number Seven?

49
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:04,931
Blackmail of the double agent
Matsou Fujiwa.

50
00:09:05,055 --> 00:09:08,968
Unfortunately, only 40 million yen.

51
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:11,051
- All the man had.
- Number Ten?

52
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:15,930
Assassination of Perringe, the anti-matter
specialist who went over to the Russians.

53
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,808
Three million francs
from the Quai d'Orsay.

54
00:09:18,935 --> 00:09:20,846
Number Five.

55
00:09:20,975 --> 00:09:25,332
Our consultation fee
for the British train robbery: £250,000.

56
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:28,566
Number Eleven.

57
00:09:28,695 --> 00:09:34,213
Distribution of Red China narcotics
in the United States: $2,300,000.

58
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:36,610
Collected by Number Nine and myself.

59
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:38,646
Two million three?

60
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:42,529
Our expectations were
considerably higher, Number Eleven.

61
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:46,011
Competition from Latin America.
Prices are down.

62
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:48,091
I anticipated that factor.

63
00:09:48,215 --> 00:09:51,207
Are you sure all monies
have been accounted for

64
00:09:51,335 --> 00:09:53,769
by yourself and Number Nine?

65
00:09:53,895 --> 00:09:55,851
To the penny, Number One.

66
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:57,931
On the contrary.

67
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,694
I have satisfied myself that one of you

68
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:03,693
is clearly guilty of embezzlement.

69
00:10:03,815 --> 00:10:08,764
SPECTRE is a fraternity whose strength
lies in the integrity of its members.

70
00:10:08,895 --> 00:10:10,851
The culprit is known to me.

71
00:10:10,975 --> 00:10:13,489
I have decided on the appropriate action.

72
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:35,414
Let us now proceed with new business.

73
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:39,767
We will hear from Number Two,
who is in charge of our NATO project,

74
00:10:39,895 --> 00:10:43,012
the most ambitious
SPECTRE has ever undertaken.

75
00:10:43,135 --> 00:10:45,012
Your report, Number Two.

76
00:10:45,135 --> 00:10:47,091
Thank you, Number One.

77
00:10:47,215 --> 00:10:51,891
Our intention is to demand a ransom
from the North Atlantic Treaty powers

78
00:10:52,015 --> 00:10:55,132
of 280 million dollars.

79
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,371
A hundred million pounds.

80
00:10:57,495 --> 00:11:01,408
I have sent SPECTRE agent Count Lippe
to the South of England

81
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:04,607
where he is making
the necessary preparations.

82
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:07,010
He is at a health clinic

83
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,808
conveniently located
near the NATO air base.

84
00:11:12,334 --> 00:11:15,132
Oh, Pat? I'll see you
when I've had a shower.

85
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:18,485
- Mr Bond... Count Lippe.
- Not taking her away already?

86
00:11:18,614 --> 00:11:20,923
She's the only joy in this dreary place.

87
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,245
I see you've discovered that, too.

88
00:11:25,374 --> 00:11:27,126
- In half an hour, Pat.
- I'll be ready.

89
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,812
I've heard that before.

90
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:32,090
Nice to have met you, Mr er... Bond.

91
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,650
Funny-looking bruise. A fall?

92
00:11:36,774 --> 00:11:39,572
A poker, in the hands of a widow.

93
00:11:39,694 --> 00:11:43,767
I'm surprised. I'd have thought
you were just the type for a widow.

94
00:11:43,894 --> 00:11:48,251
Oh, not this one. He didn't like me at all.

95
00:11:49,494 --> 00:11:51,450
A red square with a spike through it.

96
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:54,964
Yes, I think it's a tong sign.
The Red Dragon from Macao.

97
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:58,803
- Ask Records to verify it.
- Sorry, sweetie. You're offduty.

98
00:11:58,934 --> 00:12:00,811
File it till you get back.

99
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:03,209
Moneypenny, I'll put you across my knee.

100
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:05,689
On yoghurt and lemon juice?

101
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:07,964
I can hardly wait!

102
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:12,406
- Pat, we're behind schedule.
- Coming.

103
00:12:12,534 --> 00:12:15,606
I can't hear you, James.
Have you fainted?

104
00:13:44,254 --> 00:13:46,768
You're late, Mr Bond.

105
00:13:47,814 --> 00:13:49,770
Me?

106
00:13:49,894 --> 00:13:52,362
Well, I'd never have recognised myself.

107
00:13:52,494 --> 00:13:54,928
- Do I seem healthy?
- Too healthy by far.

108
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:57,124
Take off your bathrobe, please.

109
00:13:59,134 --> 00:14:01,329
You never say that as if you meant it.

110
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:03,410
Arms above your head, please.

111
00:14:16,134 --> 00:14:18,090
Behave yourself, Mr Bond!

112
00:14:19,054 --> 00:14:22,285
Oh, I can see there's only one place
to keep you quiet.

113
00:14:23,374 --> 00:14:25,330
And what's this?

114
00:14:25,454 --> 00:14:28,571
A motorised traction table
for stretching the spine.

115
00:14:28,694 --> 00:14:31,686
- Some patients call it "the rack".
- I'm not surprised.

116
00:14:31,814 --> 00:14:33,486
Oh, get on.

117
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:38,971
- Where's the kick-starter?
- Stop fooling around. Face down, please.

118
00:14:40,334 --> 00:14:44,009
By the way, who is the man in the room
next to your Count Lippe?

119
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:47,410
I really don't know too much about him.
A Mr Angelo.

120
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:52,130
He's here with a private physician,
recuperating from an awful car crash.

121
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:56,804
There now. First time
I've felt really safe all day.

122
00:14:59,454 --> 00:15:02,446
I'll look in and see
how you're doing in 1 5 minutes.

123
00:15:22,094 --> 00:15:23,971
Nice to have met you, Mr Bond.

124
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:28,613
Hey!

125
00:15:28,734 --> 00:15:30,531
Hey, come back!

126
00:15:30,894 --> 00:15:32,247
Hey!

127
00:15:34,254 --> 00:15:35,812
Help!

128
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:39,126
Help!

129
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:41,210
Hey!

130
00:15:51,134 --> 00:15:54,251
Mr Bond! Mr Bond! Oh, thank God!

131
00:15:54,374 --> 00:15:56,888
Thank God! You could have been killed!

132
00:15:58,814 --> 00:16:00,770
I must be six inches taller.

133
00:16:01,614 --> 00:16:03,570
Oh, you poor dear!

134
00:16:03,694 --> 00:16:06,162
I can't think how it could have happened.

135
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:09,764
I can tell you,
it's a miracle I came back when I did.

136
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:13,933
I can only think that you must have
pushed the switch accidentally.

137
00:16:14,054 --> 00:16:16,010
Well, you'd better come with me.

138
00:16:16,134 --> 00:16:19,683
Spend a few minutes in the steam room.
It'll help to relax you.

139
00:16:19,814 --> 00:16:22,328
- Yes...
- It might even shrink you back to size.

140
00:16:22,454 --> 00:16:25,605
Somebody's going to wish
today had never happened.

141
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,690
Oh, you wouldn't tell Dr Wain?

142
00:16:27,814 --> 00:16:29,770
Please. I'd lose my job.

143
00:16:30,654 --> 00:16:34,124
Well, I suppose my silence
could have a price.

144
00:16:34,254 --> 00:16:36,006
You don't mean...?

145
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:39,285
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

146
00:16:48,334 --> 00:16:50,290
See you later,

147
00:16:50,414 --> 00:16:52,370
alligator.

148
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:25,852
- What the hell are you doing?
- Don't worry. I'll tell the chef.

149
00:17:25,974 --> 00:17:28,363
Let me out of this bloody machine! Help!

150
00:17:29,654 --> 00:17:31,610
Help!

151
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:42,250
Mink.

152
00:17:42,374 --> 00:17:44,330
It reduces the tensions.

153
00:17:46,094 --> 00:17:47,209
Not mine.

154
00:18:00,989 --> 00:18:03,059
Major Derval's social secretary.

155
00:18:03,189 --> 00:18:05,145
I would like to speak to MrAngelo.

156
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:06,827
- What's that?
- MrAngelo.

157
00:18:06,949 --> 00:18:09,417
I'm sorry. You got the wrong number.

158
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:13,028
We'd be more comfortable
if you take off...

159
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:17,185
- Yes?
- Major Derval?

160
00:18:17,309 --> 00:18:19,698
- This is Major Derval.
- Your car is waiting.

161
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:21,945
I'll be down right away. Thank you.

162
00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:25,382
My car's here. Duty calls.
The story of my life.

163
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:27,465
You'll be late at the air base.

164
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:30,387
And besides,
it will give you time to cool off.

165
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,465
You'll be here when I come back?

166
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:35,828
But I may not be in the mood then.

167
00:18:37,189 --> 00:18:40,147
- Do you want to bet?
- You know your François?

168
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:41,827
I know me.

169
00:18:41,949 --> 00:18:43,940
All right, all right.

170
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:46,025
I told him I'd be down.

171
00:18:46,149 --> 00:18:48,105
Your coat, sir?

172
00:18:48,469 --> 00:18:50,425
Happy landing.

173
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:52,107
Thank you.

174
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:55,263
Be good... at least until I get back.

175
00:18:56,829 --> 00:18:58,262
Ciao!

176
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:11,979
- Nobody saw us. The corridor is empty.
- Shut that door!

177
00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:18,779
He's dead all right. Lippe, you take over.

178
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,184
Are the doctor and ambulance outside?

179
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:23,584
- Everything, as arranged.
- Angelo!

180
00:19:24,109 --> 00:19:26,179
Your breathing equipment.

181
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:28,982
Isolates you from the oxygen supply.

182
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:31,987
Gamma gas. Instantaneous.
Type you just used.

183
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:34,065
And most important...

184
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,147
Not enough.

185
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:42,624
$100,000 is not enough.

186
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:46,224
- What are you trying to say?
- I changed my mind.

187
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:49,819
Two years of my life,
studying the film, the reports,

188
00:19:49,949 --> 00:19:53,066
plastic operations, voice lessons.

189
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:55,225
Make it a quarter of a million

190
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:57,465
or get someone else.

191
00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:01,859
- There is no-one else!
- Exactly. I am Derval.

192
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,627
Put that away. Angelo is right.

193
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:14,547
I'll inform Number One
we made a new arrangement.

194
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:16,819
This is merely a down payment.

195
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:19,668
All right, but against quarter of a million.

196
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:21,745
Agreed.

197
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:24,145
His watch. Identification disc.

198
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:30,348
- Au revoir!
- No, no. He always says "ciao".

199
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:34,142
- Ciao!
- The cap is too far back on your head.

200
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:40,423
The rest of my money, just have it ready.

201
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:46,339
Come on. Get him into his pyjamas.

202
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:02,225
Sir? ldentity, please, sir.

203
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:10,547
Thank you, sir.

204
00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:13,945
This is a normal training sortie.

205
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:18,540
You'll be accompanied by a NATO
representative, Commandant Derval.

206
00:21:18,669 --> 00:21:20,625
Major Derval of NATO.

207
00:21:20,749 --> 00:21:24,708
It's a routine flight.
You'll be flying a Vulcan at 45,000 feet,

208
00:21:24,829 --> 00:21:27,662
armed with two atomic bombs,
MOS type.

209
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:30,349
Fuses as usual in the white security box.

210
00:21:58,172 --> 00:22:00,527
Oh, those damned aeroplanes!

211
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,768
They're enough to drive you mad!

212
00:22:04,972 --> 00:22:09,170
Unless, of course, it's...
that mink glove of yours.

213
00:22:11,132 --> 00:22:13,362
I'll... shut out the noise.

214
00:22:35,372 --> 00:22:37,761
James? James, where are you going?

215
00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:42,249
Nowhere.
I thought I'd take a little... exercise.

216
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:45,248
You must be joking!

217
00:22:46,372 --> 00:22:48,328
Come on!

218
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:53,848
Quiet!

219
00:24:49,132 --> 00:24:51,487
Windsor Police. Can I help you?

220
00:24:51,612 --> 00:24:54,524
County Police here. Hello? Hello?

221
00:25:01,252 --> 00:25:05,689
- What's happening? What's going on?
- Could it be the front door bell?

222
00:25:05,812 --> 00:25:08,610
- No, it most certainly could not.
- Oh, hello.

223
00:25:08,732 --> 00:25:11,485
Haven't you had enough exercise
for one evening?

224
00:25:11,612 --> 00:25:13,568
It's funny you should say that.

225
00:25:18,427 --> 00:25:22,261
Point of return: 45 minutes, 30 seconds.

226
00:25:24,867 --> 00:25:26,823
Switch from manual to auto.

227
00:25:26,947 --> 00:25:29,586
Right. Set on automatic. Commandant?

228
00:25:29,707 --> 00:25:34,098
Would you care to change places
with the co-pilot? Better view up here.

229
00:25:34,227 --> 00:25:36,183
I'll be delighted to.

230
00:26:02,907 --> 00:26:06,786
RAFJET Kilo Kilo Tango 56.

231
00:26:07,627 --> 00:26:09,583
This is Southern Radar.

232
00:26:09,707 --> 00:26:12,505
You are now under positive radar control.

233
00:26:12,627 --> 00:26:14,982
This is avoiding action.

234
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:18,258
Turn onto a heading of0.92 degrees...

235
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:12,183
Request you report your position.

236
00:27:16,027 --> 00:27:18,382
RAFJET Mike Bravo X-ray.

237
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:25,064
Request you report your position.
This is the bomber controller to RAFJET.

238
00:27:25,187 --> 00:27:27,257
Mike Bravo X-ray 79.

239
00:27:27,387 --> 00:27:29,343
Over.

240
00:27:31,947 --> 00:27:35,576
Report your position.
Report your position.

241
00:27:45,627 --> 00:27:47,379
Here, take this, will you?

242
00:27:47,507 --> 00:27:49,418
What's the flap, Dawson?

243
00:27:49,547 --> 00:27:51,583
OBNR, sir. NATO training flight.

244
00:27:51,707 --> 00:27:54,426
Air traffic lost it on radar
and we can't pick it up.

245
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:58,586
- Was she losing altitude just before?
- Rapidly. We can't scan below 300 feet

246
00:27:58,707 --> 00:28:00,663
and, well, she may have gone down.

247
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:04,302
- Was she in trouble?
- Not according to the last report.

248
00:28:04,427 --> 00:28:08,022
- She is armed, isn't she?
- Two atomic weapons, sir. MOS type.

249
00:28:08,147 --> 00:28:11,059
Get everything you can into the area.
A thorough search.

250
00:28:11,187 --> 00:28:13,462
Notify the Admiralty at once. Top priority.

251
00:28:13,587 --> 00:28:15,543
Ask them to contact Washington.

252
00:28:42,627 --> 00:28:45,744
- Is there anything else in sight?
- No, all clear.

253
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:48,427
Switch on the underwater landing lights.

254
00:30:03,907 --> 00:30:07,695
- Open the underwater hatch.
- Open underwater hatch.

255
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:19,566
Stand by to winch in the submarine!

256
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,601
Man the winches!

257
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:28,888
- Give these bomb fuses to Mr Kutze.
- Right, sir.

258
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,966
Get the submarine up quickly,
and the bombs loaded.

259
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:38,002
And you, Kutze.
Are you pleased with your new toys?

260
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,644
Some new safety device. A secret control.

261
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:44,399
What can they have that
the great Ladislav Kutze cannot handle?

262
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:47,363
Life was much simpler
in my Warsaw laboratory.

263
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,448
Your share will amount to
how many Nobel prizes?

264
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:52,526
Bomb forward!

265
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,363
More... more... more... Hold it!

266
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:21,158
Paris, sir. Number One on the scrambler.

267
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,802
Number Two speaking.
Phase two completed.

268
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,886
Number Two has done well,

269
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,966
unlike Count Lippe,

270
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:34,969
whose choice of Angelo might have
jeopardised the success of our project.

271
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,046
Send a message to the Execution Branch.

272
00:35:39,545 --> 00:35:41,775
- You will write? Or telephone?
- Day by day!

273
00:35:41,905 --> 00:35:45,659
I'm sorry to dash off.
There's been a bit of a flap at the office.

274
00:35:45,785 --> 00:35:49,573
- What kind of work do you do, anyway?
- Oh, l... travel.

275
00:35:49,705 --> 00:35:52,094
A sort of... Iicensed trouble-shooter.

276
00:35:53,145 --> 00:35:55,340
Mr Angelo. Heart attack last night.

277
00:35:55,465 --> 00:35:57,535
I'm not surprised.

278
00:35:58,945 --> 00:36:02,142
- Keep in touch.
- Any time, James. Any place.

279
00:36:02,265 --> 00:36:04,620
Another time, another place.

280
00:37:22,627 --> 00:37:24,504
You are late!

281
00:37:24,627 --> 00:37:28,063
Yes. Some people on the roads
really burn you up these days.

282
00:37:28,187 --> 00:37:30,701
In the Conference Room.
Something big.

283
00:37:30,827 --> 00:37:33,182
Every 00 man in Europe's been rushed in.

284
00:37:33,307 --> 00:37:37,095
- And the Home Secretary, too.
- His wife's probably lost her dog.

285
00:37:51,587 --> 00:37:53,657
Well, now that we're all here...

286
00:37:58,467 --> 00:38:03,018
The Prime Minister has asked the Home
Secretary to represent him here today.

287
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:05,103
The Home Secretary.

288
00:38:06,267 --> 00:38:09,703
Gentlemen,
the tape that you are about to hear

289
00:38:09,827 --> 00:38:12,261
was received
at 10 Downing Street today.

290
00:38:13,187 --> 00:38:15,303
My dear Prime Minister.

291
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:17,383
Two atomic bombs,

292
00:38:17,507 --> 00:38:19,463
numbers 456 and 457,

293
00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:22,863
which were aboard NATO flight 759,

294
00:38:22,987 --> 00:38:25,376
are now in the possession of SPECTRE.

295
00:38:25,507 --> 00:38:29,386
Unless within the next seven days
your government pays to us

296
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:32,305
one hundred million pounds sterling,

297
00:38:32,427 --> 00:38:34,895
in a manner to be designated by us,

298
00:38:35,027 --> 00:38:37,825
we shall destroy
a major city in England

299
00:38:37,947 --> 00:38:40,063
or the United States ofAmerica.

300
00:38:41,347 --> 00:38:43,941
Please signal your acceptance
of our terms

301
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:46,535
by arranging for Big Ben to strike

302
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:49,977
seven times at 6pm tomorrow.

303
00:38:51,547 --> 00:38:56,416
The Prime Minister and the President
have talked together over the hotline

304
00:38:56,547 --> 00:39:00,825
and have agreed that
unless the bombs are recovered

305
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:02,983
payment will have to be made.

306
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:06,099
To avoid general panic,
secrecy will be maintained,

307
00:39:06,227 --> 00:39:08,183
and no press announcements.

308
00:39:09,147 --> 00:39:13,618
The Prime Minister has asked that your
department take charge of the operation.

309
00:39:13,747 --> 00:39:15,703
Thank you, sir. Sir John.

310
00:39:30,547 --> 00:39:33,903
This circle represents
the full flying range of the Vulcan.

311
00:39:34,027 --> 00:39:37,702
Extensive search has not found
any evidence of a crash or landing.

312
00:39:37,827 --> 00:39:40,580
And worldwide reports
have proved negative

313
00:39:40,707 --> 00:39:43,665
on all airfields large enough
to handle the Vulcan.

314
00:39:43,787 --> 00:39:46,426
- That's all we have, sir.
- Thank you, Sir John.

315
00:39:46,547 --> 00:39:48,503
Well, I'll leave you to carry on.

316
00:39:48,627 --> 00:39:52,097
- We'll keep you in touch from Number 10.
- Thank you, sir.

317
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:57,025
You may now open the folders
in front of you.

318
00:40:05,147 --> 00:40:07,581
Code name: Thunderball.

319
00:40:09,747 --> 00:40:12,215
As you can see, we've very little to go on.

320
00:40:12,347 --> 00:40:15,783
All the members of the crew
had top security clearance.

321
00:40:15,907 --> 00:40:20,185
You'll find their photographs
and service records in your files.

322
00:40:20,307 --> 00:40:24,585
You'll be working with NATO, CIA,
and all allied intelligence units.

323
00:40:24,707 --> 00:40:28,905
That's all, until you discuss
your individual assignments with me.

324
00:40:31,307 --> 00:40:33,696
I've assigned you to Station C, Canada.

325
00:40:33,827 --> 00:40:37,183
Group Captain Pritchard here
will be your Air Force Liaison.

326
00:40:37,307 --> 00:40:40,185
Sir, I respectfully suggest
that you assign me to Nassau.

327
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:43,856
Is there a reason besides
your enthusiasm for water sports?

328
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:46,419
Perhaps this, sir.

329
00:40:48,747 --> 00:40:50,226
Well?

330
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:53,896
There was a photograph of that man
in this dossier you gave us.

331
00:40:54,027 --> 00:40:55,699
His name is Derval.

332
00:40:55,827 --> 00:40:58,739
I saw him last night at Shrublands,
but he was dead.

333
00:40:58,867 --> 00:41:02,940
Not possible. He was seen boarding
the Vulcan. Took off last night.

334
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:07,060
If 007 says he saw Derval last night
at Shrublands and he was dead,

335
00:41:07,187 --> 00:41:09,906
that's enough for me to initiate enquiries.

336
00:41:10,027 --> 00:41:11,540
Yes, sir. Of course.

337
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:14,818
- Who is this girl?
- Derval's sister, sir.

338
00:41:16,227 --> 00:41:18,582
- Do you know where she is now?
- Nassau.

339
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:21,862
Do you think she's worth going after?

340
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:26,460
- I wouldn't put it quite that way, sir.
- You've only got four days, 007.

341
00:41:26,587 --> 00:41:28,942
Don't spend your time sitting around.

342
00:41:29,067 --> 00:41:31,023
No, sir, I won't.

343
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:34,344
Good luck.

344
00:41:34,467 --> 00:41:36,025
Thank you, sir.

345
00:41:36,547 --> 00:41:40,859
Smashing figure! I don't suppose
that has anything to do with your request!

346
00:41:40,987 --> 00:41:43,057
Was ever a man more misunderstood?

347
00:41:43,187 --> 00:41:45,826
James,
you can't pull the wool over my eyes.

348
00:41:45,947 --> 00:41:49,622
You may be able to con the old man,
but I know better. I could...

349
00:41:50,787 --> 00:41:52,743
So do l, Miss Moneypenny.

350
00:41:52,867 --> 00:41:56,257
And I'll thank you
not to refer to me as "the old man".

351
00:41:58,187 --> 00:42:00,143
I think I had a hat when I came in.

352
00:42:05,707 --> 00:42:07,459
James...

353
00:42:07,587 --> 00:42:09,737
How else will you recognise her?

354
00:42:09,867 --> 00:42:13,223
Couldn't miss. She has
two moles on the left thigh.

355
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:16,686
- Thank you, Mr...?
- James Bond.

356
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,446
I arrived soon after you went down.

357
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,959
I've been admiring your form.

358
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:26,083
Have you, now? Your name's James Bond
and you've been admiring my form?

359
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,326
Most girls just paddle around.

360
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:30,406
- You swim like a man.
- So do you.

361
00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:32,885
Well, I've had quite a bit of practice.

362
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:36,798
- Do you come here often?
- When I'm bored. Practically every day.

363
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:38,921
What else do you do, and where?

364
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:41,484
- You don't waste time, do you?
- No.

365
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:43,362
- For effort.
- Thank you.

366
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,958
I'll wear it, so you'll know me next time.

367
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:48,846
I was right. Couldn't miss.

368
00:43:48,970 --> 00:43:51,325
- I'm not with you.
- Oh, you soon will be.

369
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:58,120
- Paula! Give me a hand, will you?
- Get in.

370
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,249
Tell London I've made contact
with the girl.

371
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:09,160
It's not what I'd call contact, but
I'll pass it through. You've seen the girl.

372
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:11,244
Keep trying.

373
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,122
It won't start!

374
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:22,680
Ahoy there! Our motor's conked out.

375
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:26,359
- Are you going near Coral Harbour?
- I wasn't, but I could.

376
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:28,526
I've a very important appointment.

377
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:31,244
- I'd appreciate a lift.
- Come aboard, then.

378
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:34,680
- You don't mind taking the service boat?
- Not at all.

379
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,243
Hurry up!

380
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:19,726
- Perhaps we could lunch by the pool.
- How about your urgent appointment?

381
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:38,321
- How long have you been out here?
- About three weeks.

382
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:42,602
- Don't you ever stop asking questions?
- All right. Change of tack.

383
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:46,882
- Have some of my conch chowder.
- You read the wrong books, Mr Bond.

384
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:49,683
- About conch chowder?
- Being an aphrodisiac.

385
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:52,882
It just so happens that
I like conch chowder.

386
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:55,088
Oh...!

387
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:00,761
- Friend of yours?
- Works for my guardian.

388
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:04,769
- Your guardian has you watched?
- He likes to know where I am.

389
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:06,482
I don't blame him.

390
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:17,246
- Will you excuse me?
- You're not going so soon?

391
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,565
I'm afraid so. My guardian's yacht.

392
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:22,804
- Oh, really?
- He'll be expecting me.

393
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:26,002
May I come with you?
I'd love to meet your guardian.

394
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:27,802
Oh, no!

395
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:30,490
- Will I see you again?
- It's a small island.

396
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:32,646
- Perhaps we can have dinner.
- No.

397
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:36,240
- My dear, uncooperative Domino...
- How do you know that?

398
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:39,203
How do you know
my friends call me Domino?

399
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,525
It's on the bracelet, on your ankle.

400
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:44,005
So, what sharp little eyes you've got!

401
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,366
Wait till you get to my teeth.

402
00:46:56,116 --> 00:46:58,789
Bye, then.
See you tomorrow on the beach.

403
00:47:31,076 --> 00:47:33,670
£500, please.

404
00:47:33,796 --> 00:47:35,752
Thanks.

405
00:47:37,596 --> 00:47:39,552
Oh. Sorry.

406
00:47:39,676 --> 00:47:41,632
- There.
- Thank you.

407
00:47:52,076 --> 00:47:54,032
200.

408
00:48:12,196 --> 00:48:14,152
Eight.

409
00:48:14,276 --> 00:48:16,073
Someone has to lose.

410
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:19,029
Yes, I thought I saw
a spectre at your shoulder.

411
00:48:20,236 --> 00:48:23,512
- What do you mean?
- The spectre of defeat.

412
00:48:23,636 --> 00:48:25,592
That your luck was due to change.

413
00:48:25,716 --> 00:48:27,627
We'll soon find out.

414
00:48:27,756 --> 00:48:30,111
Any objection to raise the limit, say £500?

415
00:48:30,236 --> 00:48:32,227
- Too big for me.
- Count me out, too.

416
00:48:32,356 --> 00:48:34,312
Perhaps you'd like to take the shoe.

417
00:48:34,436 --> 00:48:36,427
My friend won't mind, Mr...?

418
00:48:36,556 --> 00:48:38,990
- Bond.
- Oh, yes. Mr Bond.

419
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:41,550
One of my associates spoke about you.

420
00:48:41,916 --> 00:48:43,907
Nothing bad, I hope.

421
00:48:46,156 --> 00:48:49,387
It's your spectre against mine.

422
00:48:49,516 --> 00:48:51,791
You wish to put the evil eye on me?

423
00:48:51,916 --> 00:48:54,908
We have a way to deal with that
where I come from.

424
00:48:55,036 --> 00:48:58,506
Well, you may hex me.
Let's see what it does for the cards.

425
00:48:58,956 --> 00:49:00,912
No.

426
00:49:01,036 --> 00:49:02,992
- Seven.
- Six.

427
00:49:20,796 --> 00:49:22,514
Eight.

428
00:49:22,636 --> 00:49:24,592
Nine.

429
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:28,310
You seem to be unbeatable, Mr Bond.

430
00:49:28,436 --> 00:49:30,791
For the moment.
This sort of thing can't last.

431
00:49:30,916 --> 00:49:33,794
- Emilio, you promised me a drink.
- Soon, my dear.

432
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:37,795
- I want to get my money back first.
- May I buy the lady a drink?

433
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:41,795
- I would appreciate that. Thank you.
- Then I must pass the shoe.

434
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,949
He'll be impossible
if his luck doesn't change.

435
00:49:49,076 --> 00:49:51,385
Somehow I don't think it will tonight.

436
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:55,106
Beluga caviar, Dom Pérignon '55.

437
00:49:55,836 --> 00:49:57,189
Thank you.

438
00:49:57,316 --> 00:49:59,876
I understand you're Mr Largo's niece.

439
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:02,832
It sounds better than...

440
00:50:02,956 --> 00:50:05,470
What would you say?
Mistress? Kept woman?

441
00:50:05,596 --> 00:50:08,156
I wouldn't say that.
Where did you meet him?

442
00:50:08,276 --> 00:50:11,348
In Capri. I was there
with my brother, François.

443
00:50:12,916 --> 00:50:15,305
Strange.
I found Emilio attractive...

444
00:50:15,436 --> 00:50:17,392
then.

445
00:50:17,516 --> 00:50:21,555
- Does he live aboard the yacht?
- No. He has a house on the island.

446
00:50:21,676 --> 00:50:23,348
- Must we talk about him?
- No.

447
00:50:23,476 --> 00:50:26,036
- I'd much rather dance.
- So would l.

448
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:35,584
- Where is your brother now?
- In England.

449
00:50:35,716 --> 00:50:38,514
He's a commandant
with the NATO forces there.

450
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:40,592
He's a wonderful person.

451
00:50:40,716 --> 00:50:43,435
The trouble is,
I never meet anyone like him.

452
00:50:43,556 --> 00:50:45,911
Only men like Largo and myself.

453
00:50:46,036 --> 00:50:48,755
- You are not like Largo.
- Really?

454
00:50:49,476 --> 00:50:51,432
Why do you say that?

455
00:50:54,316 --> 00:50:56,546
The way you... hold me.

456
00:51:00,236 --> 00:51:01,988
There.

457
00:51:07,556 --> 00:51:12,107
- How long are you staying on in Nassau?
- We are going the day after tomorrow.

458
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:14,625
As I said, we haven't got
very much time.

459
00:51:15,876 --> 00:51:17,832
Emilio wants to leave.

460
00:51:21,156 --> 00:51:23,192
Are you sleeping aboard tonight?

461
00:51:23,716 --> 00:51:26,071
I hoped you'd not be so obvious.

462
00:51:26,196 --> 00:51:29,427
Well, when one has little time,
one has to be obvious.

463
00:51:29,556 --> 00:51:32,275
- You know where you can find me.
- Mr Bond!

464
00:51:32,396 --> 00:51:34,512
Your niece is an excellent dancer.

465
00:51:34,636 --> 00:51:38,185
Let me prove I'm as good a loser
as you are a winner, Mr Bond.

466
00:51:38,316 --> 00:51:41,706
Come to lunch on Sunday,
at Palmyra. It's my house here.

467
00:51:41,836 --> 00:51:43,554
Sunday at noon, then.

468
00:51:43,676 --> 00:51:45,155
My dear.

469
00:51:45,276 --> 00:51:47,232
- Good night.
- Good night.

470
00:51:47,356 --> 00:51:49,995
Tell me what Mr Bond had to say,
word for word.

471
00:51:50,116 --> 00:51:52,027
He talked about you, a little.

472
00:51:52,156 --> 00:51:54,875
What was he saying just then?
I didn't quite hear.

473
00:51:54,996 --> 00:51:58,272
- He asked if we'd sleep aboard tonight.
- Interesting.

474
00:52:13,627 --> 00:52:16,858
- My key. It's 304, please.
- Thank you. 304.

475
00:52:18,867 --> 00:52:20,823
- I'm sorry. No mail.
- Thank you.

476
00:52:48,627 --> 00:52:50,583
Paula?

477
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:52,583
Paula?

478
00:54:19,947 --> 00:54:21,699
Well, hello, 00...

479
00:54:47,227 --> 00:54:49,582
That's a fine way to treat the CIA!

480
00:54:49,707 --> 00:54:53,302
Sorry about that, Felix,
but you were just about to say 007.

481
00:54:53,427 --> 00:54:54,985
Here.

482
00:54:55,107 --> 00:54:58,986
- Well, James? Have you killed him?
- You know me better than that.

483
00:54:59,107 --> 00:55:00,859
There you go, smiler.

484
00:55:02,827 --> 00:55:05,295
Have you seen everything
you came to see?

485
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,497
Go back to your friends and report.

486
00:55:07,627 --> 00:55:10,778
Tell them: the little fish
I throw back into the sea.

487
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:13,421
- Give it to him.
- You'd shoot me in the back?

488
00:55:14,387 --> 00:55:16,378
The gun, I mean.

489
00:55:19,627 --> 00:55:21,345
Now move!

490
00:55:21,467 --> 00:55:23,822
- Who was he?
- Like I said, a small fish.

491
00:55:23,947 --> 00:55:25,903
Working for a Mr Largo.

492
00:55:26,027 --> 00:55:28,860
He's got a yacht
we should take a look at later.

493
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:36,496
- Quist, to see Mr Largo.
- Open up!

494
00:55:48,267 --> 00:55:49,746
Yes?

495
00:55:49,867 --> 00:55:51,425
It's Quist!

496
00:55:53,547 --> 00:55:56,015
Gently, my friend, gently.

497
00:55:57,347 --> 00:55:59,303
- What did you find?
- Nothing.

498
00:55:59,427 --> 00:56:01,383
- You saw Bond?
- Yes, I saw him.

499
00:56:01,507 --> 00:56:03,463
What happened?

500
00:56:07,227 --> 00:56:09,377
You let him get the better of you.

501
00:56:12,507 --> 00:56:14,543
No! He was at the beach!

502
00:56:14,667 --> 00:56:17,181
No! No! No!

503
00:56:35,922 --> 00:56:39,392
- Hey there! Did you finally make contact?
- You're late.

504
00:56:39,522 --> 00:56:43,640
- Felix Leiter, meet Pinder, our man here.
- How do you do? This way, gentlemen.

505
00:56:43,762 --> 00:56:47,357
- Who's the girl, James?
- Paula Kaplan, my assistant here.

506
00:56:54,972 --> 00:56:59,727
Now here is a special announcement
from the Overseas Service ofthe BBC.

507
00:56:59,852 --> 00:57:03,128
Big Ben struck seven times
at six o'clock this evening.

508
00:57:03,252 --> 00:57:05,891
This was caused by
a mechanical failure,

509
00:57:06,012 --> 00:57:09,971
which last occurred during
a violent electrical storm in 1898.

510
00:57:10,092 --> 00:57:11,969
Once again, the headlines...

511
00:57:12,092 --> 00:57:15,846
Obviously stalling for time.

512
00:57:18,092 --> 00:57:20,048
- Oh, no.
- Ah! 007.

513
00:57:20,172 --> 00:57:22,732
- What a wonderful surprise.
- For me, too.

514
00:57:22,852 --> 00:57:27,164
I must say, I find equipping you
in the field, on the run, as it were,

515
00:57:27,292 --> 00:57:29,248
highly irregular.

516
00:57:29,372 --> 00:57:31,328
Here we have a Geiger counter.

517
00:57:32,412 --> 00:57:34,368
Useful and unobtrusive.

518
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,722
The sweep hand counts radioactivity.

519
00:57:36,852 --> 00:57:39,525
- It's waterproof, of course.
- But of course.

520
00:57:40,612 --> 00:57:44,048
Now here's something
I want you to use with special care.

521
00:57:45,572 --> 00:57:47,324
With special care.

522
00:57:47,452 --> 00:57:51,081
- Everything you give me...
- Is treated with equal contempt, I know.

523
00:57:51,212 --> 00:57:53,203
But that's an underwater camera.

524
00:57:53,332 --> 00:57:56,449
It takes eight pictures in rapid succession.

525
00:57:56,572 --> 00:58:00,451
- Is that clever?
- If it can take pictures in the dark, yes.

526
00:58:04,572 --> 00:58:08,167
Try to be a little less
than your usual frivolous self, 007.

527
00:58:08,292 --> 00:58:13,685
Now here's a miniature Very pistol, which
fires a bright red flare, a distress signal.

528
00:58:13,812 --> 00:58:17,646
- You should keep it on you day and night.
- I resent that remark.

529
00:58:18,052 --> 00:58:19,405
Here!

530
00:58:21,012 --> 00:58:22,968
Look, do you mind?

531
00:58:23,092 --> 00:58:27,131
In the event of a rebreather
not being available, use this device.

532
00:58:27,252 --> 00:58:30,688
For short periods only, of course.
Say about four minutes.

533
00:58:30,812 --> 00:58:33,849
- Clever.
- Obviously you'd use it as a last resort.

534
00:58:33,972 --> 00:58:39,490
- It closes to a convenient pocket size.
- Assuming one has a convenient pocket.

535
00:58:39,612 --> 00:58:41,204
Now pay attention.

536
00:58:41,332 --> 00:58:44,449
A recently developed
harmless radioactive device.

537
00:58:44,572 --> 00:58:45,846
Harmless?

538
00:58:45,972 --> 00:58:48,930
It sends out a homing signal
to a special receiver.

539
00:58:51,932 --> 00:58:55,971
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- Obviously, you... swallow it.

540
00:58:56,892 --> 00:58:58,450
Now?

541
00:59:02,052 --> 00:59:05,283
Let's hope she'll still be lying
in the same place tonight.

542
00:59:05,412 --> 00:59:08,802
We'll use this catamaran
as a rendezvous place for later.

543
00:59:08,932 --> 00:59:11,321
- Good idea.
- Take her in.

544
00:59:13,878 --> 00:59:18,349
A container will be dropped offthe coast
of Burma in the Mergui Archipelago,

545
00:59:18,478 --> 00:59:20,514
Iatitude 20 degrees north,

546
00:59:21,038 --> 00:59:23,074
Iongitude 60 degrees east,

547
00:59:23,998 --> 00:59:26,956
at 2000 hours Greenwich Mean Time
on May 27th.

548
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:34,031
It will hold blue-white flawless diamonds
between three and eight carats.

549
00:59:34,158 --> 00:59:38,674
Total value to be not less than
100 million pounds, present market price.

550
00:59:40,078 --> 00:59:44,356
After we have recovered the container
and verified its contents,

551
00:59:44,478 --> 00:59:48,391
you will be notified
on radio frequency 16.23 megacycles

552
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:51,157
where the atomic bombs
may be recovered.

553
00:59:53,278 --> 00:59:56,270
- Kenniston, get on to De Beers at once.
- Yes, sir.

554
00:59:56,398 --> 00:59:59,470
Well, gentlemen,
unless those bombs are found,

555
00:59:59,598 --> 01:00:02,158
I'm afraid we'll have to pay their price.

556
01:00:02,278 --> 01:00:05,156
- Sir...
- Oh, yes.

557
01:00:05,278 --> 01:00:08,111
Signal from 007 in Nassau.
A few things that might interest us.

558
01:00:10,621 --> 01:00:13,215
The Disco Volante is still in the harbour,
off the Casino Channel.

559
01:00:13,341 --> 01:00:15,855
The catamaran too,
so we can use her for cover.

560
01:00:15,981 --> 01:00:18,176
Fine. Drop me in the water behind her.

561
01:00:18,301 --> 01:00:20,371
- Any further news from London?
- No.

562
01:00:20,501 --> 01:00:22,969
Zero hour is still 2000 hours
on the 27th.

563
01:00:23,101 --> 01:00:26,093
- That's just 55 hours from now.
- Yes. Shall we go?

564
01:00:30,221 --> 01:00:33,372
- OK. This'll do here.
- We'll meet back at Pinder's.

565
01:00:33,501 --> 01:00:35,059
Good luck.

566
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:28,097
Turn the underwater lights on.

567
01:01:35,581 --> 01:01:37,731
TV closed circuit!

568
01:01:57,981 --> 01:02:00,131
Hand grenades.

569
01:02:00,261 --> 01:02:01,819
Ready!

570
01:02:10,261 --> 01:02:12,297
Down there.

571
01:02:25,301 --> 01:02:26,654
There!

572
01:02:33,421 --> 01:02:35,377
Quick! Launch!

573
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:08,976
Hey! There's something there!

574
01:03:15,341 --> 01:03:17,297
That's him! Turn around!

575
01:03:25,821 --> 01:03:27,777
Hold that.

576
01:03:27,901 --> 01:03:30,699
Look! We must have hit him
with the propeller.

577
01:03:30,821 --> 01:03:32,777
Let's get back and tell Largo.

578
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:12,816
- Can I have a lift?
- Sure.

579
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:16,216
- Thank you. You just about saved my life.
- Really?

580
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:19,059
My outboard capsized
so I had to swim ashore.

581
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:22,136
How far do you go?

582
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:26,735
You'd better fasten your safety belt.

583
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:31,973
- What's your name?
- James Bond.

584
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,896
Fiona Volpe.

585
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:55,413
- Do you fly here often?
- Do I make you nervous?

586
01:04:55,540 --> 01:05:00,660
No. It's just that I have no desire
to be capsized twice in one night.

587
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:03,135
At least you won't have to swim ashore.

588
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,616
Have you been here before, Mr Bond?

589
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,696
No, I haven't.

590
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:15,653
- But this is the road to Nassau?
- Yes.

591
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:17,736
Eventually.

592
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:43,609
- Well, this is as far as I go.
- Yes, me too. This is my hotel.

593
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,379
- What a coincidence!
- Yes. So convenient.

594
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:51,500
You look pale. I hope I didn't frighten you.

595
01:05:51,620 --> 01:05:55,977
- I've always been a nervous passenger.
- Some men just don't like to be driven.

596
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:59,092
No, some men just don't like
to be taken for a ride.

597
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:09,971
Look at this.

598
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,056
An underwater hatch.

599
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,694
That's how they could leave and get back.

600
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:19,132
So nobody saw them. The whole
operation was carried out underwater.

601
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,535
That's where we'll look for the plane.

602
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:24,254
I'll bring the prints to the hotel.

603
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:34,096
The Air Force searched the area
250 miles out of Nassau.

604
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,131
It must be beyond that radius.

605
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:39,138
That's if the Disco Volante
was out that night.

606
01:06:39,260 --> 01:06:42,809
Sure she was. But Harbour Control
said only for six hours.

607
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:48,573
She couldn't cover 500 miles
in that time, no.

608
01:06:48,700 --> 01:06:52,693
About 90 miles is her limit for six hours,
and that's out and back.

609
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:59,859
I reckon we've got to go further out.
We'll need more gas for that.

610
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:01,936
Let's get back to Nassau.

611
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:05,530
- We haven't much time.
- You're right, James, we haven't.

612
01:07:23,060 --> 01:07:24,618
Pull!

613
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:29,093
Of course they are watching us, my dear.
What else have they to do?

614
01:07:32,180 --> 01:07:36,173
- You would like Bond dead.
- I can think of no better arrangement.

615
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:39,178
Because he tries to make love
to your... woman?

616
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:42,895
Because he is Bond and, as an enemy
of SPECTRE, should be killed.

617
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:44,373
Mark!

618
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:48,495
If Bond had died last night
as a result of your hastiness,

619
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:52,408
his government would have known
for certain the bombs are here.

620
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:55,259
When the time is right,
he will be killed. Pull!

621
01:07:57,140 --> 01:07:58,698
I shall kill him.

622
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:04,771
A separate pool.

623
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:07,289
For sharks, no less. Move in.

624
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:11,096
Hold on that line.

625
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:16,736
That's Largo's place, all right.
My next port of call.

626
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:37,772
- Mr Largo?
- Yes, sir.

627
01:08:37,900 --> 01:08:39,458
Thank you.

628
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:57,256
Can I help?

629
01:08:57,380 --> 01:08:59,336
Why, Mr Bond. Of course you can.

630
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:01,655
That looks particularly inviting.

631
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:04,419
Mr Bond. Welcome to Palmyra.

632
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:08,215
It's a pleasure.
I just hope I'm not interrupting anything.

633
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:12,094
- What do you mean?
- I thought you might have another visitor.

634
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:14,176
No.

635
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:17,128
That gun. Looks more fitting for a woman.

636
01:09:17,260 --> 01:09:19,455
Do you know much about guns, Mr Bond?

637
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,536
No. I know a little about women.

638
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,612
Mr Janni, Mr Vargas.

639
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:27,617
Mr Vargas, Mr Janni.

640
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:29,298
Which is which?

641
01:09:29,420 --> 01:09:32,218
You might have met Mr Vargas
the other night.

642
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:36,209
- Oh, yes. I believe I did.
- Drinks, sir.

643
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:39,889
- Rum Collins, Mr Bond?
- Yes. Just about that hour, isn't it?

644
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:44,016
For you?

645
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:47,577
Of course!
Vargas does not drink. Does not smoke.

646
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:50,776
Does not make love.

647
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,856
What do you do, Vargas?

648
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:57,539
Every man has his passion.
Mine is fishing.

649
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:01,376
What is yours, Mr Bond?

650
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,492
Well... I'm not what you'd call
a passionate man.

651
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:13,019
I think it's time I went to change.

652
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,736
You must let me show you around.

653
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:18,816
Oh, I'd love that.

654
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:21,090
I thought you might.

655
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:22,096
Pull!

656
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:24,176
What could be easier?

657
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:27,292
- Perhaps you'd call one for me.
- Of course. Pull!

658
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:28,978
Seems terribly difficult.

659
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:35,170
- No, it isn't, is it?
- No...

660
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:43,089
I collect big game fish
for various marine institutions.

661
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,176
Magnificent creatures.

662
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:47,736
Charming.

663
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:52,331
The notorious Golden Grotto sharks.
The most savage, the most dangerous.

664
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,291
They know when it's time to be fed.

665
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:58,218
- That boat, is she yours?
- The Disco Volante? Yes.

666
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:02,174
- I'm very proud of her.
- What does she do? About 1 5 knots?

667
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,256
Better than that. Near 20.

668
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:06,814
Perhaps you'd like to see over her.

669
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:08,896
Yes, I would, very much.

670
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:11,898
- Emilio, lunch is ready.
- Thank you, my darling.

671
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:15,012
Come, Mr Bond.
The conch chowder smells delicious.

672
01:11:15,140 --> 01:11:18,610
Domino, I was thinking,
as I'll be busy this evening,

673
01:11:18,740 --> 01:11:21,493
perhaps Mr Bond will take you
to the Junkanoo.

674
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:24,373
It's our local Mardi Gras.
You'll be my guest, Mr Bond.

675
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:26,456
- That's very kind.
- It will be my pleasure.

676
01:11:33,411 --> 01:11:36,881
- Oh, hello!
- Oh, hello.

677
01:11:37,011 --> 01:11:39,764
Our Mr Bond must have
a high opinion of himself.

678
01:11:39,891 --> 01:11:41,847
- Opinion?
- Yes.

679
01:11:42,371 --> 01:11:44,168
He has a date with me, too.

680
01:11:46,971 --> 01:11:48,689
Excuse me.

681
01:12:03,851 --> 01:12:07,207
Let me go! Let me go! No!

682
01:12:07,491 --> 01:12:09,049
No!

683
01:12:09,651 --> 01:12:11,607
Don't let her make so much noise.

684
01:12:11,731 --> 01:12:13,244
Use the chloroform.

685
01:12:43,931 --> 01:12:46,491
Largo did promise he'd come, didn't he?

686
01:12:46,611 --> 01:12:49,079
He'll be here, don't worry.

687
01:12:50,211 --> 01:12:52,566
James, I think that man's waving at you.

688
01:12:52,691 --> 01:12:54,124
James! Come down here!

689
01:12:55,571 --> 01:12:57,084
Quick!

690
01:12:57,851 --> 01:12:59,807
Excuse me for a second.

691
01:13:02,251 --> 01:13:04,207
James, Paula's gone.

692
01:13:04,331 --> 01:13:07,926
- What do you mean, "gone"?
- She's checked out of the hotel.

693
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:10,087
You look after Domino. Watch her.

694
01:13:10,211 --> 01:13:14,648
- You think she was on to something?
- I've got to find out. Watch out for her.

695
01:13:15,051 --> 01:13:17,007
All right. Thank you.

696
01:13:17,131 --> 01:13:21,249
The Governor's not happy, but you'll
have a power cut all over the island.

697
01:13:21,371 --> 01:13:23,839
I don't give a damn
about the rest of the island.

698
01:13:23,971 --> 01:13:27,361
- I just want the lights out in Palmyra.
- You'll have it.

699
01:13:54,771 --> 01:13:56,727
What do you mean, she won't talk?

700
01:13:56,851 --> 01:13:58,807
Don't worry. She will.

701
01:13:58,931 --> 01:14:02,162
What's wrong?

702
01:14:04,411 --> 01:14:08,165
- Dimitri! ls it a power failure?
- Yes! All over the island!

703
01:14:08,291 --> 01:14:10,964
- Switch to the emergency generator.
- Yes, sir.

704
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:48,842
Largo told you to be careful.

705
01:14:48,971 --> 01:14:52,043
I didn't kill her.
She must have taken some poison.

706
01:14:52,171 --> 01:14:55,288
A capsule in the mouth.
What do you think? Cyanide?

707
01:14:56,491 --> 01:14:57,970
She's dead.

708
01:15:14,571 --> 01:15:17,244
- What's happened?
- Someone's got Ricardo!

709
01:15:25,171 --> 01:15:27,366
Search that way.
And you, the sharks' pool!

710
01:15:32,171 --> 01:15:33,843
What happened?

711
01:15:33,971 --> 01:15:35,723
Leave him! This way!

712
01:15:41,331 --> 01:15:43,367
Stop it! Stop it!

713
01:15:43,491 --> 01:15:46,927
You fools!
He's got you all shooting at each other!

714
01:15:47,051 --> 01:15:49,326
It started down there!

715
01:15:56,611 --> 01:15:58,567
Over here!

716
01:16:30,131 --> 01:16:32,486
No, no. I've got a better idea.

717
01:16:49,691 --> 01:16:52,763
- Lift the tunnel hatch and let them in.
- Yes, sir.

718
01:18:02,851 --> 01:18:05,411
Sorry, old chap. Better luck next time.

719
01:18:11,306 --> 01:18:13,262
Tell Leiter to stay with the girl.

720
01:18:13,386 --> 01:18:15,422
I'll get back to him as soon as I can.

721
01:18:15,546 --> 01:18:17,901
- Anything else?
- Tell him Paula's dead.

722
01:18:53,986 --> 01:18:56,580
- Oh!
- Hello!

723
01:18:57,586 --> 01:19:01,784
- Aren't you in the wrong room, Mr Bond?
- Not from where I'm standing.

724
01:19:02,626 --> 01:19:06,539
Since you are here, would you mind
giving me something to put on?

725
01:19:22,306 --> 01:19:24,422
I'm very glad to see you again, Mr Bond.

726
01:19:24,546 --> 01:19:26,696
And I'm glad to see you again.

727
01:19:26,826 --> 01:19:29,135
I had a feeling you've been avoiding me.

728
01:19:29,266 --> 01:19:32,622
Well, you see, I had no idea
we were next-door neighbours.

729
01:19:32,746 --> 01:19:35,135
They just moved me down this afternoon.

730
01:19:35,266 --> 01:19:37,700
It's extraordinary, isn't it? Almost as if...

731
01:19:37,826 --> 01:19:39,782
As if it was intended.

732
01:19:39,906 --> 01:19:42,466
Yes, it... is extraordinary.

733
01:19:42,586 --> 01:19:45,419
Shouldn't you get out
of those wet clothes?

734
01:19:45,546 --> 01:19:47,935
You'll catch your... death of cold.

735
01:19:54,906 --> 01:19:57,818
Now look.
You know we're going to be too late.

736
01:19:57,946 --> 01:20:00,062
- Too late for what?
- The Junkanoo.

737
01:20:00,186 --> 01:20:02,780
I promised my friends
I'd meet them there.

738
01:20:02,906 --> 01:20:05,022
Perhaps you know them. The Largos.

739
01:20:05,546 --> 01:20:09,459
Questions, questions.
All I get is questions.

740
01:20:09,586 --> 01:20:12,305
But the music is gonna
go on all night anyhow.

741
01:20:12,426 --> 01:20:14,417
- Enough to drive you wild.
- Yeah?

742
01:20:14,546 --> 01:20:17,458
Do you like wild things,
Mr Bond, James Bond?

743
01:20:17,586 --> 01:20:19,542
Wild?

744
01:20:20,506 --> 01:20:22,462
You should be locked up in a cage.

745
01:20:28,546 --> 01:20:30,582
This bed feels like a cage.

746
01:20:30,706 --> 01:20:32,662
All these bars.

747
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:35,778
Do you think I'll be... safe?

748
01:20:47,106 --> 01:20:50,701
You made a shocking mess
out of my hair, you sadistic brute.

749
01:20:50,826 --> 01:20:52,782
Will you zip me up, please?

750
01:20:55,466 --> 01:20:57,934
No wonder you can
get dressed so quickly.

751
01:20:58,066 --> 01:21:00,182
On the way we can have a little talk.

752
01:21:00,306 --> 01:21:02,262
You may find it interesting.

753
01:21:02,386 --> 01:21:04,342
Come on.

754
01:21:04,466 --> 01:21:06,934
I'm coming. I'd hate to miss anything.

755
01:21:10,586 --> 01:21:13,737
And now we can go somewhere
for an interesting talk.

756
01:21:13,866 --> 01:21:15,822
Friends of yours, no doubt.

757
01:21:15,946 --> 01:21:17,902
Come in!

758
01:21:19,386 --> 01:21:22,935
You dress quickly too.
I didn't see that gun in the mirror.

759
01:21:23,066 --> 01:21:27,901
Not that it matters,
but that was under the pillow all the time.

760
01:21:28,866 --> 01:21:33,337
- And when did you find out?
- You're wearing the same ring as Largo.

761
01:21:34,186 --> 01:21:36,097
It's a ring I like to wear.

762
01:21:36,226 --> 01:21:38,376
Vanity has its dangers.

763
01:21:38,506 --> 01:21:40,462
Vanity, Mr Bond,

764
01:21:40,586 --> 01:21:42,895
is something you know so much about.

765
01:21:43,026 --> 01:21:45,301
My dear girl, don't flatter yourself.

766
01:21:45,426 --> 01:21:47,542
What I did was for king and country.

767
01:21:47,666 --> 01:21:50,499
You don't think it gave me
any pleasure, do you?

768
01:21:54,986 --> 01:21:57,420
But of course! I forgot your ego, Mr Bond.

769
01:21:57,546 --> 01:22:00,538
James Bond, who only has to
make love to a woman

770
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:03,738
and she starts to hear
heavenly choirs singing.

771
01:22:03,866 --> 01:22:08,064
She repents and immediately returns
to the side of right and virtue.

772
01:22:09,746 --> 01:22:11,702
But not this one.

773
01:22:13,506 --> 01:22:16,578
What a blow it must have been,
you having a failure.

774
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:19,822
Well, can't win them all.

775
01:22:21,746 --> 01:22:24,818
We'll take him out the front way.
Go and get the car.

776
01:22:24,946 --> 01:22:26,902
Careful, Mr Bond. Careful.

777
01:22:41,881 --> 01:22:43,872
Now look.

778
01:22:45,881 --> 01:22:50,079
Get through to Palmyra. Tell them
we've been held up by the Junkanoo.

779
01:22:50,201 --> 01:22:52,157
- Like a drink, man?
- Get him away!

780
01:22:52,281 --> 01:22:54,875
- Don't you try anything.
- Get out of here!

781
01:22:55,001 --> 01:22:58,232
- It's real firewater.
- Get out of it! Get out of here!

782
01:22:58,361 --> 01:22:59,874
It can't harm you, man.

783
01:23:06,441 --> 01:23:07,476
Go after him!

784
01:23:24,401 --> 01:23:26,357
- You haven't seen anything?
- No.

785
01:23:26,481 --> 01:23:28,039
Look!

786
01:23:28,161 --> 01:23:30,516
Follow it. You, that side. You, there.

787
01:24:31,281 --> 01:24:32,475
Stay with us now.

788
01:26:26,107 --> 01:26:28,462
- Thank you. I'd love to.
- Love to what?

789
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,143
Oh, you're mad! Do you know that?

790
01:26:34,267 --> 01:26:36,223
Yes! lsn't everyone?

791
01:26:40,107 --> 01:26:43,338
- May I cut in?
- You should've said your wife was here.

792
01:26:54,427 --> 01:26:56,383
Do you come here often?

793
01:26:56,507 --> 01:26:58,862
It's no good trying to escape, Mr Bond.

794
01:26:59,907 --> 01:27:01,863
I don't want to escape.

795
01:27:03,347 --> 01:27:06,942
Strange as it may seem,
I've grown accustomed to your face.

796
01:27:17,187 --> 01:27:19,860
Why don't you come with us quietly?

797
01:27:19,987 --> 01:27:21,943
You don't seem to understand.

798
01:27:22,067 --> 01:27:24,023
You see, I enjoy my dancing.

799
01:28:01,227 --> 01:28:04,583
Mind if my friend sits this one out?
She's just dead!

800
01:28:16,672 --> 01:28:19,630
You'll leave at 0600 hours
and land at Aden to refuel.

801
01:28:19,752 --> 01:28:23,461
You will then proceed to the Mergui
Archipelago to make your drop

802
01:28:23,592 --> 01:28:25,548
precisely at 20 degrees north,

803
01:28:25,672 --> 01:28:27,310
60 degrees east.

804
01:28:27,432 --> 01:28:30,310
The diamonds will be
in a special container...

805
01:28:30,432 --> 01:28:32,388
I hate to give in on this.

806
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:35,310
Paying them blood money.
Letting them beat us.

807
01:28:35,432 --> 01:28:38,504
- Have you an alternative?
- I'm afraid I haven't.

808
01:28:38,632 --> 01:28:42,181
- I thought 007 was on to something.
- I thought so too, sir.

809
01:28:42,312 --> 01:28:44,268
- False alarm?
- Afraid so.

810
01:28:44,392 --> 01:28:48,146
He obviously has a highly developed
sense of... shall we say drama?

811
01:28:48,272 --> 01:28:50,342
If 007 thought he was on to something...

812
01:28:50,472 --> 01:28:53,544
Pity he didn't make sure
before he shouted the odds.

813
01:28:53,672 --> 01:28:55,981
We have exactly 14 hours and 50 minutes.

814
01:28:56,112 --> 01:28:59,821
Then we shall have to pay up
and look as happy as we can, shan't we?

815
01:29:35,952 --> 01:29:38,671
That's it, James.
We've looked about everywhere.

816
01:29:38,792 --> 01:29:41,306
We've got to find that plane.

817
01:29:43,312 --> 01:29:46,702
You won't find it down there.
That's the Golden Grotto.

818
01:29:46,832 --> 01:29:48,788
Golden Grotto?

819
01:29:48,912 --> 01:29:51,790
Yeah. All you'll find
down there are sharks.

820
01:29:53,392 --> 01:29:55,906
- Take it down. I want a closer look.
- At what?

821
01:29:56,032 --> 01:29:57,784
Never mind! Take it down quick!

822
01:30:04,872 --> 01:30:06,863
Set her down. I think we've found it.

823
01:30:18,472 --> 01:30:22,226
There's something camouflaged
down there. I'll take a look.

824
01:30:22,352 --> 01:30:25,469
Shoot one of those sharks.
It'll keep the others occupied.

825
01:30:35,112 --> 01:30:39,788
I don't know how long the others will take
to finish him off, but they'll be back.

826
01:30:39,912 --> 01:30:41,868
- I'll keep an eye on them.
- Good.

827
01:32:42,272 --> 01:32:44,342
Take these.

828
01:32:47,432 --> 01:32:49,388
She's down there, all right.

829
01:32:49,512 --> 01:32:51,468
- Are the bombs on board?
- No.

830
01:32:51,592 --> 01:32:55,187
- Great! What's our next move?
- We'll check on the Disco Volante.

831
01:32:55,312 --> 01:32:58,065
If the bombs aren't on board now,
they soon will be.

832
01:32:58,192 --> 01:33:00,148
Who are you going to ask? Largo?

833
01:33:00,272 --> 01:33:02,308
No... I don't think we'll have to.

834
01:33:54,735 --> 01:33:56,851
I hope we didn't frighten the fish.

835
01:34:01,215 --> 01:34:03,410
Sea egg spines. They're poisonous!

836
01:34:03,535 --> 01:34:05,491
Here. Give me your arm.

837
01:34:08,175 --> 01:34:10,131
Sit down.

838
01:34:11,215 --> 01:34:13,171
Now turn over.

839
01:34:15,655 --> 01:34:17,611
This is going to hurt a bit.

840
01:34:25,375 --> 01:34:28,890
It's the first time I've tasted women.
They're rather good.

841
01:34:29,015 --> 01:34:31,370
You're the only man to ever make me cry.

842
01:34:31,495 --> 01:34:34,567
Except François, my brother,
when we were children.

843
01:34:34,695 --> 01:34:37,004
Domino... I have to tell you something.

844
01:34:38,975 --> 01:34:43,412
I'm sorry, James. I didn't mean to
embarrass you, speaking of love. I know...

845
01:34:43,535 --> 01:34:46,049
- I must hurt you again.
- You're going away.

846
01:34:46,175 --> 01:34:49,929
- "Sorry, my dear. It's all over."
- No, it's about your brother.

847
01:34:50,615 --> 01:34:52,571
What about him?

848
01:35:04,815 --> 01:35:06,328
François...

849
01:35:11,375 --> 01:35:13,331
He's...

850
01:35:17,575 --> 01:35:19,133
He's dead?

851
01:35:22,895 --> 01:35:25,728
- What happened?
- It's a long story.

852
01:35:25,855 --> 01:35:29,245
And it involves your friend... Largo.

853
01:35:40,055 --> 01:35:43,252
- Domino, I need your help.
- Of course.

854
01:35:44,455 --> 01:35:46,366
That's why you make love to me.

855
01:35:46,495 --> 01:35:50,329
Look, I can't explain what this is all about,
but you must trust me.

856
01:35:50,455 --> 01:35:54,812
- Because you want me to help you?
- Look, Largo had your brother murdered.

857
01:35:54,935 --> 01:35:59,725
Thousands, hundreds of thousands of
people will die soon if you don't help me.

858
01:36:03,815 --> 01:36:07,046
That much we do know.
But there's something we don't.

859
01:36:07,175 --> 01:36:10,724
The bombs... When they'll be loaded
aboard the Disco Volante.

860
01:36:10,855 --> 01:36:14,131
- How could I know that?
- That you'll have to find out.

861
01:36:15,855 --> 01:36:18,574
It won't be easy.
It could be very dangerous.

862
01:36:18,695 --> 01:36:21,255
What can he do to me
he hasn't already done?

863
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:23,331
Then you'll do it?

864
01:36:25,415 --> 01:36:26,973
- Yes.
- Good.

865
01:36:27,095 --> 01:36:30,326
This is a Geiger counter.
You press this lever.

866
01:36:30,455 --> 01:36:33,128
If it starts clicking, the bombs are aboard.

867
01:36:33,255 --> 01:36:35,815
- What do I do then?
- Go straight up on deck.

868
01:36:35,935 --> 01:36:39,291
As the Disco Volante is being watched,
you'll be spotted.

869
01:36:39,415 --> 01:36:40,973
Vargas behind you.

870
01:36:42,975 --> 01:36:44,931
Really?

871
01:36:46,615 --> 01:36:48,571
He must have followed us.

872
01:36:53,655 --> 01:36:55,611
I think he got the point.

873
01:36:55,735 --> 01:36:57,691
It should have been Largo.

874
01:36:57,815 --> 01:36:59,373
Largo...

875
01:36:59,495 --> 01:37:02,214
- When did he expect you back?
- Very soon now.

876
01:37:02,335 --> 01:37:05,054
He said not to be late.
He was most insistent.

877
01:37:05,575 --> 01:37:08,726
- You go back. I'll take care of Vargas.
- James...

878
01:37:08,855 --> 01:37:12,609
Understand, I'm doing this for my brother.
For what he did to him.

879
01:37:12,735 --> 01:37:15,932
Promise you will kill Largo for me,
whatever happens.

880
01:37:20,495 --> 01:37:22,690
- You haven't much time.
- All right.

881
01:37:22,815 --> 01:37:24,726
Oh, something I remembered.

882
01:37:24,855 --> 01:37:26,925
- It may not be important.
- Tell me.

883
01:37:27,055 --> 01:37:31,048
There's a small bridge over the canal.
Largo never allows strangers near it.

884
01:37:31,175 --> 01:37:32,927
- By it is a flight of steps.
- To where?

885
01:37:35,638 --> 01:37:40,154
To the sea, on the far side ofPalmyra.
Perhaps it is important, after all.

886
01:39:06,398 --> 01:39:08,150
Put on your equipment.

887
01:39:23,958 --> 01:39:27,109
Did we get a message saying
the girl went on board the Disco?

888
01:39:27,238 --> 01:39:29,194
- Yes, sir. Received at...
- OK, OK.

889
01:39:29,318 --> 01:39:32,390
- If she is on board, where's 007?
- That's a question.

890
01:39:35,078 --> 01:39:37,034
Stand by. Five seconds.

891
01:39:37,998 --> 01:39:40,114
Watch my signal.

892
01:40:22,838 --> 01:40:24,794
Prepare to get under way.

893
01:40:28,958 --> 01:40:31,233
Captain, weigh anchor.

894
01:40:31,358 --> 01:40:33,314
Get under way immediately.

895
01:40:33,438 --> 01:40:37,431
Once we pick up the merchandise,
head for our target area, Miami.

896
01:40:45,238 --> 01:40:47,354
The Disco Volante is leaving, sir.

897
01:44:46,013 --> 01:44:47,765
I told you to stay in your cabin.

898
01:44:47,893 --> 01:44:49,884
It's stuffy. I want a breath of air.

899
01:44:50,013 --> 01:44:51,969
My dear, did you not hear me?

900
01:44:52,093 --> 01:44:55,051
- Where did you get that?
- I bought it this morning.

901
01:45:01,853 --> 01:45:04,492
Mr Bond gave you this little toy, I imagine.

902
01:45:05,493 --> 01:45:07,449
And Vargas is dead!

903
01:45:11,053 --> 01:45:13,248
No, my dear, there is no escape for you.

904
01:45:13,373 --> 01:45:15,841
Like your friend,
you've been a bit too clever.

905
01:45:15,973 --> 01:45:17,770
And now you are caught!

906
01:46:03,653 --> 01:46:06,042
You've given me much pleasure, Domino.

907
01:46:07,413 --> 01:46:10,962
But in return, unless you tell me
how much Bond knows,

908
01:46:11,093 --> 01:46:14,085
I'll be forced to cause you great pain.

909
01:46:14,213 --> 01:46:17,922
This for heat,... these for cold.

910
01:46:18,053 --> 01:46:21,648
Applied scientifically and slowly.

911
01:46:21,773 --> 01:46:24,128
Very, very slowly.

912
01:46:35,013 --> 01:46:38,005
- What do you want?!
- We're activating the bombs.

913
01:46:38,133 --> 01:46:40,488
- You said to tell you.
- Oh, yes.

914
01:46:41,613 --> 01:46:46,050
A private little matter, my friend,
between the young woman and myself.

915
01:46:46,173 --> 01:46:47,765
Go!

916
01:46:47,893 --> 01:46:50,726
Do not live in hope.
There is no-one to rescue you.

917
01:47:06,024 --> 01:47:07,935
Now go on.

918
01:47:08,064 --> 01:47:11,613
It's a good thing the homing capsule
he swallowed is still working.

919
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,223
Straight ahead.

920
01:47:17,944 --> 01:47:20,538
Go right. Go on right!

921
01:47:40,824 --> 01:47:42,780
That's him!

922
01:47:56,944 --> 01:47:59,094
Hold it!

923
01:48:08,624 --> 01:48:10,057
Up!

924
01:48:23,744 --> 01:48:26,702
Get your radio man on to Orlando Beach!

925
01:48:26,824 --> 01:48:28,780
Warn them the target is Miami!

926
01:48:28,904 --> 01:48:32,294
Also, the bomb is transferred
from the Disco Volante

927
01:48:32,424 --> 01:48:34,380
onto a wreck off Fowley Point!

928
01:48:34,504 --> 01:48:36,574
Right. Hang on to that.

929
01:51:18,640 --> 01:51:22,076
- And the kitchen sink!
- On you, everything looks good.

930
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,156
Take this.

931
01:51:29,640 --> 01:51:31,596
Good luck.

932
01:58:19,951 --> 01:58:21,782
- Weigh anchor!
- Aye aye, sir.

933
01:58:47,831 --> 01:58:50,504
- Make smoke!
- Making smoke... now!

934
01:58:57,391 --> 01:59:00,827
- Stand by for conversion.
- Standing by.

935
01:59:04,431 --> 01:59:06,467
Jettison cocoon!

936
01:59:13,311 --> 01:59:14,107
Cocoon's away.

937
01:59:27,311 --> 01:59:30,303
Keep firing! They're closing!

938
01:59:48,991 --> 01:59:52,301
Come on! Fire! More! Over there!

939
02:00:03,822 --> 02:00:05,778
Away from there.

940
02:00:05,902 --> 02:00:07,858
We've still got one bomb aboard.

941
02:00:08,822 --> 02:00:10,778
He's gone mad!

942
02:00:10,902 --> 02:00:13,132
Please talk to them for me.

943
02:00:13,262 --> 02:00:16,698
Tell them I only did what I had to do,
what I was told to do.

944
02:00:28,582 --> 02:00:30,140
Where is he?

945
02:00:30,262 --> 02:00:32,139
The bomb cannot be exploded now.

946
02:00:32,342 --> 02:00:34,617
I threw the arming device into the sea.

947
02:00:34,742 --> 02:00:36,698
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

948
02:00:45,902 --> 02:00:46,778
Get him!

949
02:02:27,062 --> 02:02:30,577
- I'm glad I killed him.
- You're glad!

950
02:02:30,702 --> 02:02:33,011
- Who's he?
- I don't know but he helped me.

951
02:02:34,462 --> 02:02:37,420
- Look out! The rocks!
- The reef!

952
02:02:39,262 --> 02:02:41,412
He's jammed the controls! Come on!

953
02:02:41,542 --> 02:02:42,531
Jump!

954
02:02:42,662 --> 02:02:44,618
- I can't swim!
- Never too late to learn.

955
02:02:48,462 --> 02:02:50,532
Get down!
