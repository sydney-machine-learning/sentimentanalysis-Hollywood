1
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:05,726
<i>My story begins in London.</i>

2
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,604
<i>Not so very long ago.</i>

3
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,690
<i>And yet so much has
happened since then,</i>

4
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,485
<i>that it seems more
like an eternity.</i>

5
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,445
<i>At that time, I lived with my pet</i>

6
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,532
<i>in a bachelor flat just
off Regent's Park.</i>

7
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,577
<i>It was a beautiful spring day,</i>

8
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,622
<i>a tedious time of the
year for bachelors.</i>

9
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,958
<i>Oh. That's my pet, Roger.</i>

10
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,545
<i>Roger Radcliffe,
a musician of sorts.</i>

11
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:35,589
<i>No. No, I'm the one with the spots.</i>

12
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,883
<i>My name's Pongo.</i>

13
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,970
<i>And you know, as far
as I could see,</i>

14
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:45,099
<i>the old notion that a bachelor's
life was so glamorous</i>

15
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:47,101
<i>and carefree was all nonsense.</i>

16
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:49,646
<i>It was downright dull.</i>

17
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:04,326
<i>It was plain to see that
my old pet needed someone.</i>

18
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:08,456
<i>But if it were left up to Roger,
we'd be bachelors forever.</i>

19
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:11,667
<i>He was married to his
work. Writing songs.</i>

20
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,669
<i>Songs about romance, of all things,</i>

21
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,840
<i>something he knew
absolutely nothing about.</i>

22
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:23,512
<i>Oh, he's intelligent
enough, as humans go.</i>

23
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:28,056
<i>And I think you could say that Roger is
a rather handsome animal in his way.</i>

24
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:33,478
<i>I could see no reason why my pet
didn't deserve an attractive mate.</i>

25
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:38,652
<i>At least, I was
determined to do my best.</i>

26
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:42,733
<i>Of course, dogs are a pretty
poor judge of human beauty.</i>

27
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:50,374
<i>But I had a rough idea
of what to look for.</i>

28
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,078
<i>Hmm. Unusual breed.</i>

29
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,712
<i>Very unusual.</i>

30
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,929
<i>Oh, surely not.</i>

31
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,765
<i>Well, now, what have we here?</i>

32
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:10,264
Hmm.

33
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,558
<i>Well, a little too short-coupled.</i>

34
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,563
<i>Nope.</i>

35
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:21,904
<i>I say... Oh, well I do say!</i>

36
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:24,278
<i>Now, there's a fancy breed.</i>

37
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:29,788
<i>Hmm... Perhaps a little too fancy.</i>

38
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:34,038
<i>Yes. That's much too fancy.</i>

39
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,919
<i>Too old.</i>

40
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,963
<i>Too young.</i>

41
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:43,631
<i>It was a problem. A real problem.</i>

42
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:49,557
<i>Well, now that's a
bit more like it!</i>

43
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:53,058
<i>The most beautiful
creature on four legs.</i>

44
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:56,897
<i>Oh, now, if only the girl...</i>

45
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:00,234
<i>Well! She's very lovely, too.</i>

46
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:02,236
<i>It was almost too good to be true.</i>

47
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:06,032
<i>I'd never find another pair like
that, not if I looked for 100 years.</i>

48
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,120
<i>Ah, they're heading for the park.</i>

49
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,871
<i>A perfect meeting place,
if I could only arrange it.</i>

50
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:19,333
<i>Uh-oh. But Roger never
stopped work till after 5:00.</i>

51
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,539
<i>That would be too late.</i>

52
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,525
After 5:00 already.

53
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:46,402
Fancy that.

54
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:50,827
All right, Pongo. All right, boy.

55
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,478
Pongo, boy, take it easy!

56
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,681
What's all the hurry?

57
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,068
Pongo, boy, slow down.

58
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,717
<i>I was afraid we'd missed them.
Perhaps they passed on by the park.</i>

59
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,928
<i>Then suddenly, I spotted them.</i>

60
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:54,599
<i>It was a perfect situation
if I planned it right.</i>

61
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,394
<i>I couldn't depend on Roger.
I knew what he'd do.</i>

62
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:01,769
<i>He'd settle on the grass, puff
his pipe and that would be it.</i>

63
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:05,401
<i>No, it was all up to me.</i>

64
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:07,650
<i>Well...</i>

65
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,428
<i>At first I had no particular plan,</i>

66
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,722
<i>just anything to attract attention.</i>

67
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,971
<i>You know, stir things up a bit.</i>

68
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,439
Pongo, you silly old
thing! Come on.

69
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,982
Come on, let's have it, boy.

70
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,527
Pongo!

71
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,197
Pongo!

72
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,000
<i>For a while, it seemed to work.</i>

73
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,461
<i>At least they had seen one another.</i>

74
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,006
<i>Things were going along first-rate.</i>

75
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,461
<i>But for some strange
reason they left!</i>

76
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,975
Come on, you old renegade.
We're going home.

77
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,935
<i>But I wasn't giving up.</i>

78
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:26,016
<i>I was determined that, somehow,
they just had to meet.</i>

79
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,562
- Oh!
- Oh!

80
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,781
I beg your pardon. I'm so
sorry. Please excuse me.

81
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,617
- I must say, what on earth!
- Oh, dear!

82
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,286
Oh, really. Good
heavens. Of all the...

83
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,330
- Oh!
- Ah!

84
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,887
Oh, my new spring
suit and my new hat!

85
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,052
I'm terribly sorry.

86
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,933
Please let me help you.

87
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,851
I'm so sorry. Pongo, you...

88
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,687
I don't know what's come over him.

89
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,024
I'm terribly sorry. He's
never acted this way before.

90
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,692
Never mind. Never mind.

91
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,779
Please, just go away.
You've done enough.

92
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,031
Please? Oh.

93
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,076
Oh, I say. Here, take mine.

94
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:21,370
Oh.

95
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,809
Wilt thou love her, comfort her,

96
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,312
honour and keep her in
sickness and in health,

97
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,898
and forsaking all others,

98
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:54,570
keep thee only unto her so
long as ye both shall live?

99
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,273
I will.

100
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,242
<i>For the first six months or so,</i>

101
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,995
<i>we lived in a small
house near the park,</i>

102
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,080
<i>a modest little place,</i>

103
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:08,625
<i>but just right for two couples
who were just starting out.</i>

104
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:18,260
Perdita, darling,
are you all right?

105
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:22,347
Oh, of course, dear.

106
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:25,976
After all, dogs were having
puppies long before our time.

107
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,653
<i>Oh, that's Nanny, a wonderful
cook and housekeeper.</i>

108
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,564
<i>She's such a kind,
understanding soul.</i>

109
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,284
<i>You know,</i>

110
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,953
<i>at times she seems almost canine.</i>

111
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,872
Roger, dear,

112
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,541
tea time.

113
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,369
Tea time!

114
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:58,088
<i>Be down in a minute</i>

115
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:11,813
<i>Do you like my new song?</i>

116
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:18,820
- Such clever lyrics.
- Melody first, my dear.

117
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:21,115
And then the lyrics, hmm?

118
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:32,206
Oh, Pongo, it's her.
It's that devil woman.

119
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:43,762
Oh, must be Cruella, your
dearly devoted old school mate.

120
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,431
Cruella De Vil.

121
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,724
That's it!

122
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,601
<i>Cruella De Vil</i>

123
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,020
<i>Cruella De Vil</i>

124
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:56,233
<i>If she doesn't scare
you no evil thing will</i>

125
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,526
Oh, Roger.

126
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,861
<i>To see her is to
take a sudden chill</i>

127
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,029
Oh!

128
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:05,534
<i>Cruella</i>

129
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,120
<i>She's like a spider
waiting for the kill</i>

130
00:13:09,372 --> 00:13:10,872
Roger, she'll hear you.

131
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,667
<i>Look out for Cruella De Vil</i>

132
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:18,380
Let her in, Nanny.

133
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:21,300
- Anita, darling!
- How are you?

134
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:25,096
Miserable as usual.
Perfectly wretched!

135
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:30,014
Where are they? Where are they?

136
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,774
For heaven sakes, where are they?

137
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:40,319
- Who, Cruella?
- The puppies! The puppies.

138
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:44,740
No time for games. Where
are the little brutes?

139
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:51,830
It'll be at least three weeks.
No rushing these things.

140
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,910
Anita, you're such a wit.

141
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,961
Here, dog, here.

142
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,213
Here, dog.

143
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:03,300
Cruella, isn't that a new fur coat?

144
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,303
My only true love, darling.

145
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:10,554
I live for furs. I worship furs!

146
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:16,602
After all, is there a woman in
this wretched world who doesn't?

147
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,614
Oh, I'd like a nice fur, but
there are many other things...

148
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,950
Sweet, simple Anita.

149
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,453
I know, I know!

150
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,783
This horrid little house
is your dream castle.

151
00:14:37,168 --> 00:14:41,874
And poor Roger is your bold
and fearless Sir Galahad!

152
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,966
Oh, Cruella.

153
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:49,346
Then of course you have
your little spotted friends.

154
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:52,140
Oh, yes.

155
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:56,311
Yes, I must say, such
perfectly beautiful coats.

156
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,731
- Won't you have some tea?
- I've got to run.

157
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,650
Let me know when the
puppies arrive.

158
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,111
- You will, won't you, dear?
- Yes, Cruella.

159
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:07,447
Don't forget, it's a promise.
See you in three weeks. Cheerio.

160
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,491
Cheerio, darling.

161
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,574
Oh!

162
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:18,083
<i>At first you think
Cruella is a devil</i>

163
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:21,458
<i>But after time has
worn away the shock</i>

164
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,506
<i>You come to realise</i>

165
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:26,925
<i>You've seen her kind of eyes</i>

166
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:31,012
<i>Watching you from underneath a rock</i>

167
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,472
You're no help.

168
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,224
<i>This vampire bat</i>

169
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,476
<i>This inhuman beast</i>

170
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:40,313
<i>She ought to be locked
up and never released</i>

171
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:45,360
<i>The world was such a
wholesome place until</i>

172
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,816
<i>Cruella
Cruella De Vil</i>

173
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,245
Roger, you are an idiot!

174
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:02,544
- Perdy?
- That witch. That devil woman.

175
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:05,088
She wants our puppies.
That's all she's after.

176
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,549
Don't worry, Perdy.
They're on to her.

177
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,260
Nothing's going to
happen to our puppies.

178
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,681
What does she want with them?
She can't possibly love them.

179
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,100
Oh, Pongo.

180
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,020
I was so happy at
first, but now I...

181
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,648
Oh, I...

182
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,773
I wish we weren't having any.

183
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:42,292
<i>Poor Perdita. Of course,
she had no choice.</i>

184
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,503
<i>The puppies arrived
right on schedule,</i>

185
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,958
<i>one wild and stormy
night in October.</i>

186
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,046
Steady, boy.

187
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,715
The puppies are here!

188
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,093
Oh, the puppies are here!

189
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:34,761
How many?

190
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,215
- Eight.
- Eight?

191
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,436
By George, Pongo! Eight puppies.

192
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,522
Ten.

193
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,191
- Eleven.
- Eleven.

194
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:52,904
Eleven? Eleven puppies, Pongo, boy.

195
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:56,985
Wait a minute now,
wait a minute, 13!

196
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,829
No, no, no. Fourteen.

197
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,541
- Oh, 15!
- Fifteen?

198
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:08,920
And the mother's doing fine, love.

199
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:11,499
You ducky thing, you.

200
00:18:12,383 --> 00:18:14,342
Fifteen puppies?

201
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,344
Why, Pongo, that's marvellous!

202
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,680
It's fabulous!

203
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,683
Why, you old rascal!

204
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,886
Fourteen.

205
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:28,648
Just 14.

206
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,398
We lost one.

207
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:34,905
Oh, poor little thing.

208
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,953
Oh, Pongo, boy.

209
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,040
It's just one of those things.

210
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,294
And yet...

211
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,169
And yet I wonder.

212
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,322
Look, Pongo.

213
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,662
Anita!

214
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,414
Nanny. Fifteen!

215
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,292
We still have 15!

216
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,170
Oh, Roger, he's all right!
Thank heaven.

217
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,923
See? He's just as good as new.

218
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:38,301
Can you imagine, Roger, 15 puppies!

219
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:43,598
Fifteen. Fifteen puppies!

220
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,016
How marvellous.

221
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,728
How marvellous,
how perfectly... Ugh!

222
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,774
The devil take it. They're
mongrels, no spots!

223
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,985
No spots at all. What a
horrid little white rat.

224
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,779
They're not mongrels!

225
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,366
They'll get their spots.
Just wait and see.

226
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,786
That's right. They'll have
their spots in a few weeks.

227
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:09,040
Oh, well, in that case I'll take
them all. The whole litter.

228
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,625
Just name your price, dear.

229
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,128
I'm afraid we can't give them up.

230
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:17,132
- Poor Perdita, she'd be heartbroken.
- Anita, don't be ridiculous.

231
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,925
You can't afford to keep them.

232
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,386
You can scarcely afford
to feed yourselves.

233
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,722
I'm sure we'll get along.

234
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,725
Yes, I know. I know!

235
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:30,228
Roger's... Roger's songs!

236
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:38,445
Enough of this nonsense. I'll pay
you twice what they're worth.

237
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:40,613
Come now, I'm being
more than generous.

238
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,115
Blast this pen.

239
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:46,321
Blast this wretched,
wretched pen! Ah!

240
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,666
When can the puppies
leave their mother?

241
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,627
Two weeks? Three weeks?

242
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,504
Never.

243
00:20:56,505 --> 00:21:01,176
- What?
- We're not selling the puppies.

244
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:05,305
Not a single one.
Do you understand?

245
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:08,099
Anita, is he serious?

246
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,809
I really don't know Roger.

247
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,813
- Cruella, he seems...
- Surely he must be joking!

248
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,274
No, no, no. I mean it.

249
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,527
You're, you're not
getting one. Not one.

250
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,356
And that's final.

251
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:27,202
Why, you horrid man!

252
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,704
You... You...

253
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,374
All right, keep the little
beasts for all I care.

254
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,668
Do as you like with them.
Drown them!

255
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:39,672
But I warn you, Anita, We're through.
I'm through with all of you!

256
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,050
I'll get even. Just wait.

257
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:44,969
You'll be sorry, you fools!

258
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,094
You idiots!

259
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,855
Oh, Roger! You were
magnificent, darling.

260
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,191
He was a bloomin' hero, ma'am!

261
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:01,362
Indeed he was. A bloomin' hero!

262
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,908
Perdy? Perdy, darling?

263
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:09,744
We're keeping the puppies,
every single one of them.

264
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:12,372
My ol' pet Roger, he told
that devil woman off.

265
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:14,749
He told her off, Perdy. She's gone.

266
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:18,955
- Darling, she's gone for good.
- Oh, Pongo.

267
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,729
- Come on, Thunderbolt.
- Come on, Thunderbolt.

268
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,824
Go get him, Thunder.

269
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,119
After him, boy.

270
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,955
He'll get that dirty
ol' horse thief.

271
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:57,125
Old Thunderbolt's the greatest
dog in the whole world.

272
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,294
He's even better than Dad.

273
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,793
No dog's better than Dad.

274
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,632
What's he going to do, Dad?

275
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,962
Shh. Shh. Let's just wait and see.

276
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,101
Look at him run, the old coward.

277
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,103
That old dirty Dawson!

278
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,272
The yellow-livered old skunk!

279
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:22,483
I'd like to tear his gizzard out.

280
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:25,445
Why, Patch, where did you
ever hear such talk?

281
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:28,024
Certainly not from your mother.

282
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:38,166
- Watch out, Thunder.
- Don't worry, Penny.

283
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:40,376
He'll get that yellow-livered...

284
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:44,005
Well, he'll get him, all right.

285
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:47,967
Lucky, get down. We
can't see. Get down.

286
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,136
Mother, make him get down.

287
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,556
Come on, Lucky. Down, dear.

288
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:58,054
Missed him. Missed him by a mile.

289
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:04,817
I'm hungry, mother. I'm hungry.

290
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,861
Now, Rolly, you've
just had your dinner.

291
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,988
But I am, just the same.

292
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:12,200
I'm so hungry I could
eat a whole elephant.

293
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:13,903
Shh!

294
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,118
There he is, behind that rock.

295
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,921
Oh, dear. He shot poor Thunder.

296
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:29,884
He missed him. Ol' Thunder's
pretending, I think.

297
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,561
See? What did I tell you?
That's one of his tricks.

298
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,938
Lucky, get down.

299
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:06,463
I'm hungry, Mother. I really am.

300
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:12,927
<i>Don't miss next week's
episode. Who will triumph?</i>

301
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,054
Ol' Thunder always wins!

302
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,974
<i>And speaking of champions, friends,</i>

303
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:22,103
<i>Kanine Krunchies is the
champion of all dog biscuits.</i>

304
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,896
<i>Kanine Krunchies can't be beat</i>

305
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,940
<i>They make each meal a special treat</i>

306
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,819
<i>Happy dogs are those who eat
nutritious Kanine Krunchies</i>

307
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,407
Perdy, we better get these
little nippers off to bed

308
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,743
if we're going for a W-A-L-K.

309
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:39,412
- We want to go, too, Mother.
- Can we, Mother?

310
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,748
We never get to go.

311
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,083
Come along, children. Bedtime.

312
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:48,421
But we're not a... bit sleepy.

313
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:51,546
We want to go for a
walk in the park.

314
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:55,338
- Dad, can we?
- Better do as your mother says.

315
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:00,099
One, two, three, four,

316
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,479
five, six, seven,

317
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,856
eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13...

318
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,317
I'm not sleepy. I'm hungry.

319
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,236
Fourteen.

320
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,692
Hmm?

321
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:16,324
<i>So do what all the smart dogs do</i>

322
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:18,534
<i>And you'll feel great
the whole day through</i>

323
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:22,622
<i>You can be a champion, too
if you eat Kanine Krunchies</i>

324
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:25,833
<i>Remember, friends,
just send five...</i>

325
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,583
Lucky, you little rascal, let's go.

326
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,525
There they go, Horace, me lad,

327
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:53,361
out for their evening
constitutional.

328
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:56,406
Oh. A lovely pair of turtledoves.

329
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:00,409
Around the Johnny Horner
and off to the park.

330
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:04,247
Yeah, I don't like it, Jasper.

331
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:07,041
One more pinch and they'll
throw the keys away.

332
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,752
Oh, come off it, Horace. We're
getting plenty of boodle.

333
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:13,089
Yes, but I've been thinkin'.

334
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:17,885
You've been thinkin'?
I warned you about thinkin'.

335
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,760
I've got the knob for this
job, so let's get on with it.

336
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,570
Ah, nobody home but
the little ol' cook.

337
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,613
You just leave her to ol' Jasper.

338
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,616
He can handle her
real diplomatic-like.

339
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:44,617
Yeah, but I still don't like it.

340
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:49,876
Here, here. Patch, you settle down.

341
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,296
Oh, dear.

342
00:27:53,297 --> 00:27:56,924
Go to sleep now.
Close your little eyes.

343
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,800
That's a good little one.

344
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,143
Who do you suppose?

345
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,645
Good evening, ma'am.

346
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:12,815
We're here to inspect the
wiring and the switches.

347
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,943
- We're from the gas company.
- Electric, electric.

348
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,320
Electric company.

349
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,989
But we didn't call
for any inspection.

350
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:23,326
Yes, I know. See, there's a new act
just been passed in Parliament.

351
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:27,330
Under the heading of the "Defence of the
Realm Act." Article four, section 29.

352
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:29,665
It's a law. And it's for
your own safety, ma'am.

353
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:33,169
I don't care what Parliament
Realm or whatever it is says.

354
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:36,631
You're not coming in here, not
with the Mister and Missus gone.

355
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:39,926
Oh, now. Come off it, Ducky.
We got no time to palaver.

356
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:43,222
We got a job to do. Excuse me!

357
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,349
What's the matter with you two?

358
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:49,936
You got cloth ears? I said
you're not coming in here!

359
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,812
- Oh!
- Oh-ho-ho!

360
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:56,108
She's a regular little
tartar, ain't she, Horace?

361
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:59,612
Don't you dare go up there,
you big, long-legged lummox!

362
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:01,739
Now I mean it.

363
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,408
If you don't get out of this house,

364
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,953
I'll call the police, I will.

365
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:11,499
Now be off with you,
you big weasel!

366
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,251
Now you've been gone and done it.

367
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:15,086
You've cut me to the quick, lady.

368
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:18,839
Why, I wouldn't stay
here if you asked me.

369
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,925
Not even for a cup of tea.

370
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:25,513
Oy! Horace, me lad, I've got a sneaky
suspicion we're not welcome here.

371
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,515
Pack up. We're leaving.

372
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,850
Sharp's the word and
quick's the action.

373
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,019
Let me out! Help!

374
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,647
I'll call the police. Help!

375
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:40,027
Goodnight, Ducky. Ta-ta!

376
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,196
Those good-for-nothing hoodlums!

377
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,365
Electric company. Hmph!

378
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,195
Nothing but common sneak thieves.

379
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:56,335
I'll bet they made off
with the good silver.

380
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:59,171
Why, I'll bet they
took every last...

381
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:01,215
The puppies!

382
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:05,845
The puppies! They're gone!
Patch? Lucky? Rolly?

383
00:30:05,846 --> 00:30:08,222
Oh! They took the puppies!

384
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,558
Oh, whatever will I do?

385
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,061
Those scoundrels!
They stole the puppies.

386
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,731
Police? Help! The puppies.

387
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:19,066
Police! Somebody help me!

388
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,396
Help! Help! Help!

389
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,116
"Dognapping!" Tsk-tsk. Can
you imagine such a thing?

390
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:36,877
"15 puppies stolen." They
are darling little things.

391
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,123
Anita and her...

392
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:45,217
And her bashful Beethoven!

393
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,886
Pipe and all!

394
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,681
Oh, Roger, you are a fool!

395
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,440
Hello?

396
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:02,276
Jasper! Jasper, you idiot!

397
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,903
<i>How dare you call here?</i>

398
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:06,947
We don't want no more of
this, we want our boodle!

399
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,866
We'll settle for half!

400
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,910
Not one shilling 'till
the job's done.

401
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,621
- Jasper! Jasper!
- <i>Do you understand?</i>

402
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,624
It's in the blinkin'
papers, pictures and all!

403
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:19,251
Hang the papers! It'll
be forgotten tomorrow.

404
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:23,214
- I don't like it.
- Shut up, you idiot!

405
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,298
What?

406
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,967
<i>Not you, miss. I mean Horace!</i>

407
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:29,296
Why, you imbecile!

408
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,779
Maybe Scotland Yard.

409
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,824
Maybe they found something.
Hello, Inspector?

410
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:51,492
- <i>Is Anita there?</i>
- Who?

411
00:31:51,493 --> 00:31:54,328
<i>- Anita!</i>
- It's for you.

412
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,330
- Hello?
- <i>Anita, darling.</i>

413
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,165
- Oh. Cruella.
<i>- Oh, Anita.</i>

414
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:00,418
<i>What a dreadful thing.
I just saw the papers.</i>

415
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,128
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

416
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:04,422
Yes, Cruella. It was quite a shock.

417
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:07,299
- Is she calling to confess?
- Roger, please!

418
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,968
She's a sly one.

419
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:11,137
We're doing everything possible.

420
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:14,765
- <i>Have you called the police?</i>
- Yes, Scotland Yard.

421
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,767
- But I'm afraid...
- Where are they?

422
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,852
You idiot!

423
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:20,438
- Anita!
- Sorry, Cruella.

424
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:24,650
Yes. If there's any news,
we'll let you know.

425
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,398
Thank you, Cruella.

426
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,281
Roger, I admit she's eccentric,
but she's not a thief.

427
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,491
She's still number one
suspect in my book!

428
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,869
She's been investigated
by Scotland Yard.

429
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,956
- What more do you want?
- I don't know, darling.

430
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,000
I don't know.

431
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:44,546
Oh, Rog. What'll we do?

432
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,670
What'll we do?

433
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:58,893
Perdy, I'm afraid
it's all up to us.

434
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:03,564
Oh, Pongo. Isn't there any hope?

435
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,901
Well, yes. There's
the twilight bark.

436
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:10,529
The twilight bark? That's
only a gossip chain.

437
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,324
Darling, it's the very
fastest way to send news.

438
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:17,661
If our puppies are anywhere in the
city, the London dogs will know.

439
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:21,537
We'll send the word tonight when our
pets take us for a walk in the park.

440
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:36,055
There's no one out tonight.
I'm afraid it's too cold.

441
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,432
We've got to keep trying, Perdy.

442
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:51,070
Perdy, we're in luck!

443
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,364
It's the Great Dane at Hampstead.

444
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,409
Pongo. Quiet, boy!

445
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:00,538
Do you want to stir up the whole
neighbourhood? Come on. Pongo.

446
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,207
- Perdy, come on!
- Let's go.

447
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:06,912
Pongo, you old idiot!

448
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,258
Come on, now. We're going home!

449
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,610
What is it, Danny?
Who's on the telegraph?

450
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:35,614
It's Pongo, Regent's Park!
It's an all-dog alert.

451
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:39,660
What's it all about? What's the word?
Tell me, Danny! Tell me, tell me!

452
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,704
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

453
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:51,878
Well, now... Hmm,
that is something.

454
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,675
What, Danny? What's something?

455
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:58,178
Fifteen Dalmatian puppies, stolen!

456
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:01,765
Have they called the police?
Scotland Yard?

457
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,017
The humans tried everything.

458
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:06,103
Now it's up to us dogs
and the twilight bark.

459
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,557
I'll sound the alert!

460
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,090
Prissy, come in here!

461
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,028
Coco!

462
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,109
Be quiet now!

463
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,285
Ah, shut up!

464
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,791
Quiet!

465
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:20,052
Will you be quiet!

466
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,712
Towser, what's going on?

467
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:57,214
What is it? What's all the gossip?

468
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:01,927
'Tain't no gossip, Lucy. It
be all the way from London.

469
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:05,556
- You don't say!
- Fifteen puppies stolen.

470
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:08,809
There's no puppies around here,
not since Nellie's last litter.

471
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,269
And they're all grown up.

472
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,480
Well, then, we'd best
send the word along.

473
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,650
It be up to me to
reach the Colonel!

474
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,737
He be the only one
in barking range.

475
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,572
You'll never reach
him at this hour!

476
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,657
Well, I can try!

477
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:26,243
I'll bark all night if I have to.

478
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,805
Hmm...

479
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:51,223
Hmm... Sounds like old Towser.

480
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,605
It's an alert. Sergeant!

481
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:58,731
Sergeant Tibs! I say, Sergeant!

482
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,280
Oh, yes, Captain!

483
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,617
Barking signal. It's an alert.
Report to the Colonel at once.

484
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:09,162
Yes, sir. Right-o, sir.
Right away, sir!

485
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:14,458
Colonel?

486
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,503
I say, Colonel!
Colonel, sir? Colonel?

487
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:21,507
- Colonel?
- What? Who goes there?

488
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,550
Sergeant Tibs reporting, sir.

489
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:27,179
- Tibs? Tibs? Oh, yes, Sergeant Tibs!
- Colonel, sir...

490
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,225
Look here, Tibs. What's the idea
of barging in at this hour?

491
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,352
- But Colonel...
- Hold on, Sergeant.

492
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,687
You hear that?

493
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,148
- Sounds like an alert.
- Yes, Colonel.

494
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,984
We'd better look into it.
Come along, on the double.

495
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,437
Right-o, sir.

496
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,491
It's old Towser down
at Withermarsh, sir.

497
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:50,577
By Jove, yes! So it is. Hmm.

498
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:52,579
Well, I'll see what he wants.

499
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:09,388
it be the Colonel.
The old boy himself!

500
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,931
He wants the message.

501
00:39:10,932 --> 00:39:14,762
You'd better make it loud and
clear or he'll never get it.

502
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:22,609
One long howl, two short.

503
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,945
- One yip and a woof.
- Two yips, sir.

504
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,781
- What's the word, Colonel?
- It's from London.

505
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,283
Then it must be important.

506
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,952
Yes, yes, I'll get the rest of it.

507
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,970
Sounds like a number.
Three fives are 13...

508
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,972
That's 15, sir.

509
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,974
Fifteen, of course 15.

510
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,147
Yes, dot, spot, spotted puddings,

511
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:01,975
poodles...

512
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,319
No, no, puddles.

513
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,653
Puddles, sir?

514
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,656
Fifteen spotted puddles stolen.

515
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,859
Oh, balderdash.

516
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,997
Better double check it, Colonel.

517
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,834
Oh, yes, yes, I suppose I better.

518
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,678
Two woofs, one yip and a woof.

519
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:33,347
It sounds like puppies, sir.

520
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:35,349
Of course, puppies.

521
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,517
Colonel, Colonel, sir,
I just remembered.

522
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,354
Two nights past I heard puppy
barking over at Hell Hall.

523
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:43,023
You mean the old De Vil place?

524
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,692
Nonsense, Tibs! No one's
lived there for years.

525
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:49,029
Hold on! There's smoke
coming from the chimney!

526
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,986
By Jove, that's strange,
strange indeed.

527
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,870
I suppose we'd better investigate.

528
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,915
I'll send word for ol'
Towser to stand by.

529
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,713
Please stand by.

530
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:10,008
- What's he mean by that?
- I don't know.

531
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,386
Oh, maybe the ol' boy's
found something!

532
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:15,716
Oh, I do hope so.

533
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:25,732
They say the ol' place is haunted or
bewitched or some such fiddle-faddle.

534
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,734
Fiddle-faddle and rot, sir.

535
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,404
Just the same, use extreme caution.

536
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:33,199
No telling what sort of
hocus-pocus you might run into.

537
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:38,745
Blast it all, Tibs.
On the double, man.

538
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,950
- On the double.
- Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

539
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,493
Psst!

540
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,959
- Rover. Spotty.
- Hmm. What?

541
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,961
Are you one of the
15 stolen puppies?

542
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:31,590
No, we're not stolen.
We're bought and paid for.

543
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:33,509
There's 99 of us all together.

544
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,842
Ninety-nine!

545
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,479
How 'bout that bunch
of little ones?

546
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,982
They have names and collars.
They're not from the pet shops.

547
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,485
- Fifteen of 'em.
- We never counted them.

548
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:53,814
They're over there by the TV.

549
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,662
- I'd better count 'em.
- Watch out for the Baduns.

550
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:03,997
Baduns?

551
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:06,416
Those two blokes,
Horace and Jasper.

552
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,870
They're mean ones, they are.

553
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,970
Hey, look, Horace!

554
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:22,675
Watch me pot His Lordship
smack on the conk.

555
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,475
How's that for calling 'em, eh?

556
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,859
One, two,

557
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,530
- three, four, five, six...
- Hey, Jasper.

558
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:40,534
Come on, now, give us a swig,

559
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,202
just a short one.

560
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:46,373
Now, Horace, this hogwash ain't fit
for a fancy bloke like yourself.

561
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:49,748
Besides, you'd get crumbs
in it, you cabbage head!

562
00:43:50,503 --> 00:43:52,546
All right.

563
00:43:52,547 --> 00:43:57,423
Guzzle the whole works. I hope it
gives you collywobbles, that's what.

564
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:06,098
Hey, Jasper. Did you...

565
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,397
Let me see. Six, seven,
eight, nine, 10, 11...

566
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:13,733
Hey, get down, you runt!

567
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,694
And stay down!

568
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,073
Go on, get out of here

569
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,075
or I'll black your other peeper.

570
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:25,412
Where was I? Nine...

571
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:28,165
Nine, three more.

572
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:32,419
Twelve and... One,
two, three. That's 15!

573
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,248
They're the ones!

574
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,885
Blimey!

575
00:44:39,886 --> 00:44:41,428
What the...

576
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:45,304
Horace, look what
we got! A tabby cat!

577
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,106
How'd you like a tabby cat stew?

578
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,651
Or a cat casserole?

579
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,322
À la mode.

580
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:26,765
- What is it, Pongo? What is it?
- Shh. It's the Great Dane.

581
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:30,143
He has news for us. He'll
meet us at Primrose Hill.

582
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:33,480
- How'll we get out?
- Uh, the back bedroom window.

583
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:36,184
It's always open a
wee bit. Come on.

584
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,491
Pongos, you've made it. Good.

585
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:48,161
- What's the word? What's the news?
- Have they found our puppies?

586
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,997
They've been located
somewhere north of here,

587
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,291
- in Suffolk.
- Oh, thank heaven.

588
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,336
- Can you leave tonight?
- We can leave right away.

589
00:45:56,337 --> 00:46:00,713
I'll go along as far as Camden
Road and give you instructions.

590
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,518
When you reach Withermarsh,
contact old Towser.

591
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:14,521
He'll direct you to the Colonel
and the Colonel will take you

592
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:16,523
to your puppies at
the De Vil place.

593
00:46:16,524 --> 00:46:19,484
- De Vil!
- The De Vil place!

594
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,487
Oh, Pongo, it was her!

595
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,989
Oh, someone you know?

596
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,693
Sorry, sir. There's
no time to explain.

597
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,829
Oh, I hope we're not too late.

598
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:34,207
Good luck, Pongos.

599
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:38,295
If you lose your way,
contact the barking chain.

600
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:40,999
They'll be standing by!

601
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:58,583
Any news, Colonel?

602
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,543
Not a blasted thing.

603
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,922
They're lost or captured,
or something or other.

604
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:06,716
- Who knows what.
- Colonel, here comes a car.

605
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,094
Come now, Tibs.
Don't be ridiculous.

606
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:11,471
- They wouldn't be driving.
- Yes, I know, sir.

607
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,640
But it's heading for Hell Hall.

608
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,144
It's stopping at the gate!

609
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:22,148
It is? Blast it all!
Better see what's up.

610
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,852
- On the double, man. On the double!
- Yes, sir.

611
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,321
Take over, Captain.

612
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,524
Right-o, sir.

613
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,998
<i>I'm sorry, Mr Simpkins.
The answer's no, no, no.</i>

614
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,459
<i>Six down, four to go.</i>

615
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:45,797
I've got no time to argue.
It's got to be done tonight.

616
00:48:45,798 --> 00:48:49,509
<i>It must be a yes or no
question, Inspector.</i>

617
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,845
Do you understand? Tonight!

618
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,847
But they ain't big enough.

619
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:56,850
You couldn't get half a dozen
coats out of the whole caboodle.

620
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,185
Coats! Dog-skin coats?

621
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,855
Then we'll settle for half
a dozen! We can't wait.

622
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:05,775
The police are everywhere.
I want the job done tonight!

623
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,944
How're we gonna do it?

624
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,655
Any way you like. Poison
them, drown them.

625
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,825
Bash them in the head.
You got any chloroform?

626
00:49:13,826 --> 00:49:16,494
- Not a drop.
- And no ether, ei-ther.

627
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,163
Eye-ther!

628
00:49:18,164 --> 00:49:22,459
I don't care how you kill the little
beasts, but do it, and do it now!

629
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,837
Aw, please, miss. Have pity.

630
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:28,381
Can't we see the rest
of the show first?

631
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,884
We want to see <i>What's My Crime</i>?

632
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,727
Listen, you idiots!

633
00:49:40,728 --> 00:49:44,063
I'll be back in the morning.
The job better be done,

634
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,608
or I'll call the police!

635
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:50,772
Do you understand?

636
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,496
I think she means it.

637
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:02,499
Ah... We'll get on with it,

638
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,704
as soon as the show's over.

639
00:50:07,338 --> 00:50:08,960
<i>Will you please sign in, sir?</i>

640
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:15,678
You'd better get out of here if
you want to save your skins.

641
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,388
- But how?
- Shh.

642
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:20,638
There's a hole in the
wall there by the door.

643
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,937
Come on, shake a leg.

644
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:26,105
Psst! Kids, follow me.

645
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:29,442
Hey, Jasper, look!

646
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,528
It's old Meathead.

647
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:37,077
Yeah, what do you know,
old Meathead Fauncewater.

648
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,490
Come on, don't crowd.

649
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:42,956
One at a time. One at a time!

650
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,542
<i>For our last contestant,</i>

651
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,586
<i>meet Mr Percival Fauncewater.</i>

652
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:53,633
<i>If the panel fails to guess your
unusual crime in ten questions,</i>

653
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:57,220
<i>you will receive two weeks
vacation at a seaside resort,</i>

654
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,430
<i>all expenses paid.</i>

655
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:04,011
<i>That is, after you've paid
your debt to society.</i>

656
00:51:06,146 --> 00:51:09,816
<i>Who will take the first
question? Inspector?</i>

657
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:13,319
<i>Mr Fauncewater, could your
crime be classified as larceny?</i>

658
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,905
<i>- A theft, burglary?</i>
- Straighten out!

659
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:19,659
Form a queue, along the wall.
Come on. Snap it up, faster.

660
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,187
<i>Mr Fauncewater is a burglar
by trade, but in this case,</i>

661
00:51:23,188 --> 00:51:24,664
<i>his crime was not burglary.</i>

662
00:51:24,665 --> 00:51:29,127
<i>I'm sorry, the answer's no. One
down, nine to go. Miss Birdwell?</i>

663
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:32,422
<i>If your crime wasn't
robbery, did you,</i>

664
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:35,425
<i>oh, dear, what I mean is,</i>

665
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:38,344
<i>do something of a violent
nature, that is...</i>

666
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,847
<i>Come, Miss Birdwell, we're
running short of time.</i>

667
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:44,934
<i>So sorry. Did you do someone in?</i>

668
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,187
<i>No, Miss Birdwell, I'm sorry.
The answer is no.</i>

669
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,356
<i>Two down, eight to go.</i>

670
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,692
<i>- Mr Simpkins?</i>
- Psst!

671
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:55,862
Hey, kid, let's go.

672
00:51:55,863 --> 00:52:00,533
<i>Could it be a violation
of a city ordinance?</i>

673
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,952
<i>Uh, no. The answer is...</i>

674
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:06,205
Hey, get out of the
way, you little runt!

675
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:09,334
<i>Three down, seven to go. Inspector?</i>

676
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:12,712
<i>Very confusing, I must say.</i>

677
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:14,631
<i>Surely, this crime could...</i>

678
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,590
<i>I'm terribly sorry.
We've run out of time.</i>

679
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:21,846
Ain't that always the way!

680
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,223
<i>Would it be possible
for Mr Fauncewater</i>

681
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,725
<i>to come back next week?</i>

682
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:28,227
<i>Then we could finish
our little game.</i>

683
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:32,523
<i>Good night, audience. See you
next week at this same time</i>

684
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:35,102
on What's My Crime?

685
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,443
Ah. Oh, well.

686
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:41,282
Come on, Horace.
Let's get on with it.

687
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:45,745
I'll pop 'em on the head,
you do the skinnin'.

688
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:48,706
No, you don't, Jasper!

689
00:52:48,707 --> 00:52:51,626
I'll pop 'em off and
you do the skinnin'.

690
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,546
Horace, look!

691
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:59,092
They're gone. They flew the coop,

692
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:02,095
right out through this hole.
Here, grab a torch.

693
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:05,049
We'll run 'em down before you
can say "Bob's your uncle."

694
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:15,643
There they go, Horace,
up the stairs.

695
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,815
Here, puppies.

696
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:26,577
Here, puppies! Come on now.

697
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,621
Don't go hiding from
ol' Uncle Jasper.

698
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:34,210
Oh, I ain't gonna hurt ya.

699
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,087
I thought we was gonna pop 'em off.

700
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,131
Shh! Shut up.

701
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:41,836
Take a squint in there. I'll
check these other two rooms.

702
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,015
Here, puppies.

703
00:53:47,808 --> 00:53:50,309
Puppies, come on out. Come
out wherever you are.

704
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,230
Horace! Ooh!

705
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,355
It's that mangy tabby cat!
He's the ringleader!

706
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,358
Head 'em off, Horace! Head 'em...

707
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,452
You bungling blockhead!

708
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,455
Back here! Back here!

709
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:15,209
Shh! Here they come.

710
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:18,296
Double-crossin' little twerps,
pulling a snitch on us!

711
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:22,133
After we took care of 'em.
There's gratitude for you.

712
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:23,836
It ain't fair, Jasper.

713
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:30,180
Horace, there they go!

714
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,645
Sergeant? I say, Sergeant.

715
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:37,599
No time to explain. Busy, sir.

716
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:46,025
Shut that door, Horace!

717
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:51,079
We'll close in on 'em. Enough
of this <i>Ring Around the Rosy</i>.

718
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:01,839
Oh, Pongo, I'm afraid we're lost.

719
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,044
It can't be far.

720
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:10,224
By Jove! It can't be the Pongos.

721
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,444
It's the Colonel. This way.

722
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,619
Colonel? Are you the Colonel?

723
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,455
Oh, Pingo! Pongo?

724
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:37,083
Our puppies, are they all right?

725
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:39,418
No time to explain.
There's trouble.

726
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,630
A big hullabaloo. Come along!

727
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,504
Follow me!

728
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:51,632
Now we've got 'em, Horace.
They've run out of room.

729
00:55:53,225 --> 00:55:55,893
What have we got here?
A couple of spotted hyenas?

730
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:58,938
Come on, Horace. Give 'em what for.

731
00:55:58,939 --> 00:56:00,648
I'm right behind ya, lad.

732
00:56:00,649 --> 00:56:02,441
Oh!

733
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,444
You clumsy clod!

734
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:10,449
Hey! I'll knock the
spots off you. Let go!

735
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,652
Let go!

736
00:56:16,915 --> 00:56:19,288
Well, by George!

737
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:29,966
You mangy mongrel!

738
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,466
I'll knock your blinkin' block off.

739
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,938
Blast 'em, Tibs. Give 'em what for.

740
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,274
No, Colonel. Retreat, retreat!

741
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:45,943
Yes. Yes, of course. Retreat!

742
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,817
Retreat, on the double!

743
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:55,828
Help, Jasper! Get me out of here!

744
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,657
Horace, they're fighting dirty!

745
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,045
Oh!

746
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:10,176
Jasper!

747
00:57:10,177 --> 00:57:12,675
Horace!

748
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:24,061
Come on, Perdy. Let's go.

749
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:31,989
I'll skin every one of
them spotted hyenas

750
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,864
if it's the last thing I do.

751
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,904
Dad! Mother!

752
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,832
- I missed you, Mommy.
- Here we are, Mommy.

753
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,377
Oh, my darlings, my darlings!

754
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:45,753
How'd you find us, Dad?

755
00:57:45,754 --> 00:57:49,048
Lucky, Patch, Pepper!

756
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:50,383
Hi, Freckles.

757
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:51,717
Oh, Daddy.

758
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,386
And Rolly, you rascal!

759
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,888
Did you bring me anything to eat?

760
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,432
Everybody here? All 15?

761
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:01,852
Twice that many, Dad.
Now there's 99 of us!

762
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:05,064
What? Ninety-nine?

763
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:07,066
Where did they all come from?

764
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:10,069
What would she want with so many?

765
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,071
She's gonna make coats out of us.

766
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:15,741
- She couldn't!
- That's right, dog-skin coats.

767
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:19,745
Oh, dog-skin coats! Come now, Tibs!

768
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,747
But it's true, sir.

769
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:25,418
Horace and Jasper were gonna
pop us off and skin us!

770
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:29,046
She's a devil, a witch!
What'll we do?

771
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:31,882
We have to get back
to London somehow.

772
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:35,720
What about the others?
What'll they do?

773
00:58:35,721 --> 00:58:38,556
Perdy, we'll take them
home with us, all of them.

774
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:41,100
Our pets would never turn them out.

775
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:44,270
Colonel, sir, lights on the road.

776
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:46,272
It's a truck headin' this way.

777
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:48,441
It's the Baduns, Horace and Jasper.

778
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:50,067
They're following our tracks.

779
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,737
We've got 'em outnumbered, Tibs.

780
00:58:52,738 --> 00:58:55,406
When I give the
signal, we'll attack.

781
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:58,409
Colonel, sir, I'm afraid
that would be disastrous.

782
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:00,578
Oh, you think so?

783
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,413
He's right. We'd better run for it.

784
00:59:02,414 --> 00:59:04,665
Out the back way,
across the pasture.

785
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,667
Thank you, Sergeant,
Colonel, Captain.

786
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,754
- Bless you all.
- How can we ever repay you?

787
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:13,424
Nothing at all. All
in the line of duty.

788
00:59:13,425 --> 00:59:15,760
That's right, sir, routine.

789
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,963
Better be off. Here they come.

790
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,808
Come on, kids, hurry.

791
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:26,437
- Good luck, Pongos.
- And never fear.

792
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:28,481
We'll hold them off
'til the bitter end.

793
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,778
Now, what's this?

794
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:36,113
Out of my way,
you barkin' haystack.

795
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,191
Or I'll knock your
blinkin' block off!

796
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:45,790
They ain't in here, Jasper.

797
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,793
They're hiding in the hay.

798
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:51,462
Give me a match.
We'll burn 'em out.

799
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:54,465
Ready, Captain. Aim.

800
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:56,009
Fire one.

801
00:59:58,804 --> 01:00:00,677
Fire two.

802
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:07,520
Hey, there they go,
the little sneaks.

803
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:11,351
Come on, back to the truck.
We'll head 'em off in half a mile.

804
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:21,826
They gotta be around
here somewhere.

805
01:00:21,827 --> 01:00:25,496
- I've been thinkin'.
- Now, Horace.

806
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:28,666
What if they went down
the froze-up creek,

807
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:31,502
so's not to leave their tracks?

808
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:33,712
Horace, you idiot!

809
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:37,133
Dogs ain't that smart.

810
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:48,227
All clear, Perdy.

811
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:53,107
- All clear.
- We gave 'em the slip! Didn't we, Dad?

812
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:55,776
They didn't even see us, Patch!

813
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:59,948
Shh, children. Children, shh.

814
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:14,086
My feet are slippery.

815
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,464
I wish we could walk on the snow.

816
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:20,464
No, son, we can't leave tracks.

817
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:43,449
Well, any sign of them?

818
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:46,285
Not so much as one
bloomin' footprint.

819
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:49,663
And we've been up and down
every road in the county.

820
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:52,625
We're froze stiff. We're givin' up.

821
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,960
Oh, no, you don't!

822
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:58,505
We'll find the little mongrels
if it takes till next Christmas.

823
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,258
Now get going! Watch your driving,

824
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:05,134
you imbeciles! Do you wanna
get nabbed by the police?

825
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:33,832
Ninety-three,

826
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:36,877
94, 95, 96,

827
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:40,798
97,

828
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:42,633
98...

829
01:02:42,634 --> 01:02:45,212
Oh, Lucky!

830
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:50,140
Come on, Lucky, boy.
We can't give up now.

831
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:54,979
I'm tired and I'm hungry
and my tail's froze,

832
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:59,316
and my nose is froze
and my ears are froze.

833
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,861
And my toes are froze.

834
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,861
Pongo!

835
01:03:06,992 --> 01:03:09,660
Pongo! Pongo!

836
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:13,330
We'd just about lost hope.
We have shelter for you,

837
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:16,205
at the dairy barn across the road.

838
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:18,711
Oh, thank goodness.

839
01:03:18,712 --> 01:03:21,256
Perdy! Perdy!

840
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,842
This way, Perdy.

841
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:27,922
- The dairy barn across the road.
- Come on, kids.

842
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:37,556
It's not far. Come on,
this way. Follow the collie.

843
01:04:02,172 --> 01:04:03,881
Just look, Queenie.

844
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:08,052
- Have you ever seen so many puppies?
- Aren't they adorable!

845
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:11,055
- Perfectly darling.
- The poor little dears.

846
01:04:11,056 --> 01:04:15,386
They're completely worn
out and half frozen!

847
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,971
They all here, Pongo?

848
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:21,065
Yes, dear. All 99 accounted for.

849
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:25,611
The famous Pongos. We were
so worried about you.

850
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:28,739
Been trying to reach you.
Afraid you'd been captured.

851
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:31,283
How did you make it all this way?

852
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:35,704
- And in such dreadful weather.
- With all those little ones.

853
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,749
I'm hungry, Mother. I'm hungry.

854
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:43,212
- I'm hungry, too.
- Mother, we're hungry.

855
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:47,466
- We're all hungry.
- I'm sorry, children.

856
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:50,469
Do they like warm milk? It's fresh.

857
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,639
- Where is it?
- Where is the milk?

858
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:56,433
Come and get it, kids.
It's on the house.

859
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:59,012
This way, children.
Around this way.

860
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,936
Don't crowd. You'll
have to take turns.

861
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:09,147
Rolly, wait your turn, dear.

862
01:05:12,158 --> 01:05:15,077
Don't worry, kids.
There's plenty for all.

863
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:18,497
Ooh! The little darlings.

864
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:22,501
Pongo, a few scraps I saved

865
01:05:22,502 --> 01:05:25,504
- for you and the missus.
- Oh, thank you.

866
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:28,674
It's not much, but it might
hold you as far as Dinsford.

867
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:30,843
Huh? Dinsford?

868
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:34,719
There's a Labrador there.
His pet is a grocer.

869
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:37,850
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

870
01:05:37,851 --> 01:05:39,518
Quite all right.

871
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:43,724
Get some rest and don't worry.
I'll be standing watch.

872
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:47,860
I don't know what
we'd have done if...

873
01:05:47,861 --> 01:05:52,531
- We're very honoured to be of service.
- We're only sorry we can't do more.

874
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:56,326
Anyone who would think of hurting
these dear little puppies...

875
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:59,872
- Shh! Duchess!
- They're so dear.

876
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:03,041
I wish they could stay
with us for always.

877
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:06,128
Princess, shh! Quiet, everyone.

878
01:06:06,129 --> 01:06:08,881
Let them sleep, the poor things.

879
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:14,714
They're so exhausted and they
still have such a long way to go.

880
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:54,544
Hurry, kids. Hurry!

881
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:17,617
Well now, what have we here?

882
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:23,453
Well, so they thought they
could outwit Cruella.

883
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,628
Jasper! Horace!

884
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:34,341
Here's their tracks heading
straight for the village.

885
01:07:34,342 --> 01:07:37,344
Blimey! Oh, it's them, all right.

886
01:07:37,345 --> 01:07:40,681
Work your way south on the side
roads. I'll take the main road.

887
01:07:40,682 --> 01:07:43,556
See you in Dinsford!

888
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:04,037
Pongo, I've got a
ride home for you.

889
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:07,708
A ride home? Perdy,
did you hear that?

890
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,042
For all of us?

891
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:11,044
You mean we don't have
to walk any more?

892
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:14,548
If we can manage it.
Come on. We'd better hurry.

893
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:18,253
We've got a ride home!
Come on, children.

894
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:27,603
See the van down the street?

895
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:30,731
It's going to London as soon
as the engine's repaired.

896
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:33,692
And there's room for all of you.

897
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:37,147
Pongo, there's Cruella.

898
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:48,957
Yes,

899
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:51,293
and Jasper and Horace.

900
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:54,796
Pongo, how will we get to the van?

901
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,340
I don't know, Perdy.

902
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:58,550
But somehow we've got to.

903
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:00,344
Mother, Dad,

904
01:09:00,345 --> 01:09:03,722
- Patch pushed me in the fireplace.
- Lucky pushed me first.

905
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:06,350
- Did not. Did not.
- Did, too. Did, too.

906
01:09:06,351 --> 01:09:08,303
Did not!

907
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:12,314
- Please, children, don't quarrel.
- Say...

908
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:16,145
Perdy, I've got an idea.

909
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,656
Pongo, what on earth...

910
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:22,658
Look, I'm a Labrador!

911
01:09:22,659 --> 01:09:25,786
We'll all roll in soot.
We'll be Labradors.

912
01:09:25,787 --> 01:09:27,496
Say, that is an idea!

913
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:30,499
Come on, kids! Roll in the soot.

914
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,168
You mean, you want us to get dirty?

915
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:36,505
Did you hear that, Freckles?
Dad wants us to get dirty.

916
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:40,550
- Mother, should we?
- Do as your father says.

917
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:44,888
- This'll be fun.
- I always wanted to get good and dirty.

918
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:50,852
That's the stuff. The
blacker the better.

919
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,979
- I'm ready.
- Me, too.

920
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,731
How's this, Dad?

921
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:57,526
Wait. That's enough. Not
too many at a time.

922
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:00,901
Uh-oh. Rolly, hold on.
You're only half done.

923
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:04,826
Now, stay right with me.

924
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:10,699
We're gonna fool the ol' mad lady.

925
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,550
Pongo.

926
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,094
I'm so afraid.

927
01:10:24,554 --> 01:10:26,722
Look, Jasper.

928
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:29,933
Do you suppose they
disguised themselves?

929
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:34,563
Say now, Horace. That's
just what they did.

930
01:10:34,564 --> 01:10:38,275
Dogs is always painting
theirselves black!

931
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:40,820
You idiot!

932
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:47,784
Well, so far so good.

933
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:50,370
Come on, Perdy. Better
get on your make-up.

934
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:52,619
I'll go ahead with the next bunch.

935
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,803
Jasper! Horace!

936
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:10,348
- Well?
- Aw, now be reasonable, miss.

937
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:12,976
We're froze clean to our bones.

938
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:17,063
We've been out all night and
all day, with nothin' to eat.

939
01:11:17,064 --> 01:11:21,193
They're somewhere in this village,
and we're going to find them.

940
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:23,362
Now get swing!

941
01:11:26,365 --> 01:11:29,910
Do you think they've seen us?

942
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:32,579
No, but we're running out of time.

943
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:34,915
Try 'er again, mate.

944
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:38,791
Hurry, Perdy. The
van's about to leave.

945
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:46,168
Better hurry.

946
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,532
I'll get the rest.

947
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:11,535
That ought to do her. She'll
get you back to London.

948
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:14,285
Better get aboard, miss.

949
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:21,747
Hey, Jasper.

950
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,093
Come on, Horace.

951
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:37,561
Hurry, kids!

952
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:48,606
Come on, kids. Run on ahead.

953
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:55,330
- She's watching us, Dad.
- Keep going.

954
01:13:03,421 --> 01:13:05,874
It can't be!

955
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:08,297
It's impossible!

956
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:14,264
Run for it!

957
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:16,934
Jasper! Horace!

958
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:20,055
Jasper!

959
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:25,146
There they go! In the van.

960
01:13:25,985 --> 01:13:28,438
After them! After them!

961
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:54,676
Pongo! There she is, Cruella.

962
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:06,149
Hey, lady, what in thunder
are you tryin' to do?

963
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:08,352
Crazy woman driver!

964
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:45,730
Pongo, look!

965
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:48,400
Jasper!

966
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:49,901
Ain't nothin' to it.

967
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:51,736
I'll give him a nudge

968
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:54,656
and shove him in the dirt.

969
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:09,838
Perdy, watch out!

970
01:15:17,096 --> 01:15:20,846
- Jasper!
- Horace!

971
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:35,447
You idiots!

972
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:38,533
You fools!

973
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,870
You imbeciles!

974
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:44,574
Ah, shut up!

975
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:48,626
<i>You've seen her kind of eyes</i>

976
01:15:48,627 --> 01:15:52,502
<i>Watching you from underneath a rock</i>

977
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:55,800
<i>Cruella De Vil</i>

978
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:57,674
<i>Cruella De</i>

979
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:02,348
Roger, after all, that's
your first big hit.

980
01:16:02,349 --> 01:16:04,551
It's made more money
than we ever dreamed of.

981
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:06,644
Yes, I know.

982
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:12,567
I still can't believe that Pongo
and Perdy would run away.

983
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:16,193
Here's a bit of Christmas
cheer for you,

984
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:20,033
if there's anything
to be cheerful about.

985
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:23,328
Oh, the dear little things.

986
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:29,373
Sometimes at night I
can hear them barking.

987
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:33,748
But it always turns
out I'm dreaming.

988
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:45,517
Roger, what on earth...

989
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:47,060
They're Labradors!

990
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:49,896
No, no. They're covered with soot.

991
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,898
Look, here's Lucky!

992
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:54,192
Pongo, boy, is that you?

993
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:58,780
Oh, Pongo, Pongo!
Ho-ho, it's Pongo!

994
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:01,032
And Perdy, my darling.

995
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:03,368
And Patch, and Rolly,

996
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:05,453
and Penny, and Freckles.

997
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:09,124
They're all here, the little dears.

998
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:12,127
- It's a miracle!
- What a wonderful Christmas present!

999
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:15,332
And look, there's a whole lot more!

1000
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,883
Look, Anita, puppies everywhere.

1001
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:20,468
There must be 100!

1002
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:24,639
One, two, three and four, is seven.

1003
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,976
Two, four, six, and three
is nine, plus two is 11.

1004
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:31,396
- Thirty-six over here.
- Thirty-six and 11, that's 47!

1005
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:34,315
- Eighteen, Roger.
- That's 65!

1006
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:37,443
Ten, 11, 12, 13!

1007
01:17:37,444 --> 01:17:38,987
Wait a minute, six more.

1008
01:17:38,988 --> 01:17:41,656
Let's see, that's 84.

1009
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:46,286
And 15 plus two, 101!

1010
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:50,915
A hundred and one? Where
did they come from?

1011
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:54,919
Oh, Pongo, you old rascal!

1012
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:57,297
- What'll we do with them?
- We'll keep 'em.

1013
01:17:57,298 --> 01:18:00,300
- In this little house?
- We'll buy a big place in the country.

1014
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:05,680
We'll have a plantation,
a Dalmatian plantation.

1015
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:09,184
Roger, that's truly an inspiration.

1016
01:18:09,185 --> 01:18:11,186
It'll be a sensation!

1017
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:14,439
We'll have a Dalmatian plantation.

1018
01:18:14,440 --> 01:18:16,893
A Dalmatian plantation, I say.

1019
01:18:17,985 --> 01:18:20,653
<i>We'll have a dalmatian plantation</i>

1020
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:23,186
<i>Where our population can roam</i>

1021
01:18:23,212 --> 01:18:24,623
- I'm hungry, mother.
<i>- In this new location</i>

1022
01:18:24,649 --> 01:18:28,412
<i>Our whole aggregation
Will love our plantation home</i>

1023
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:44,755
<i>Dalmatian plantation home</i>
