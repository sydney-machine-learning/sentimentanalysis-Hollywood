1
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,570
<i>And it is written that in the year 63 B. C...</i>

2
00:06:32,008 --> 00:06:34,772
<i>the Roman legions,</i>
<i>like a scourge of locusts...</i>

3
00:06:34,844 --> 00:06:36,436
<i>poured through the east...</i>

4
00:06:36,512 --> 00:06:39,811
<i>laying waste the land of Canaan</i>
<i>and the Kingdom of Judea.</i>

5
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:45,282
<i>Rome's lmperial Armies,</i>
<i>a tumult in the hills...</i>

6
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:48,254
<i>struck Jerusalem's walls</i>
<i>in a three-month siege.</i>

7
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:53,561
<i>Breaching the gates, these legions laid</i>
<i>the dust of battle with a shower of blood.</i>

8
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:08,341
<i>Under the eye of General Pompey,</i>
<i>the Holy City fell...</i>

9
00:07:08,978 --> 00:07:12,709
<i>her people strewn</i>
<i>like wheat in the harvest time of Rome.</i>

10
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:35,536
<i>While Pompey, triumphant...</i>

11
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,299
<i>dared take the last high place...</i>

12
00:07:39,008 --> 00:07:41,408
<i>the still-living heart of the city...</i>

13
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:43,540
<i>the Temple.</i>

14
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:51,876
<i>Here, on this most sacred ground</i>
<i>in all Jerusalem...</i>

15
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:55,317
<i>now Pompey's horse took its way.</i>

16
00:08:08,938 --> 00:08:13,375
<i>Where no pagan had ever set foot,</i>
<i>in the court of the priests...</i>

17
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:16,971
<i>most irreverent Pompey</i>
<i>stood himself down.</i>

18
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:49,403
<i>At last, here was the fruit of the harvest.</i>

19
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:53,310
<i>Here, it was said,</i>
<i>lay the treasure house of Jehovah...</i>

20
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:58,376
<i>great statues of gold,</i>
<i>as bright as the sun in this ancient land.</i>

21
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:05,691
<i>So Pompey,</i>
<i>burning for the touch of precious metals...</i>

22
00:09:06,229 --> 00:09:07,958
<i>entered the sanctuary.</i>

23
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,409
<i>But entering, Pompey found</i>
<i>only a scroll of parchment...</i>

24
00:09:29,418 --> 00:09:33,218
<i>a covenant with the one God,</i>
<i>handed down by Moses...</i>

25
00:09:33,623 --> 00:09:35,784
<i>and venerated through the years.</i>

26
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:01,806
<i>Thus, for more than 50 years</i>
<i>after Pompey's invasion...</i>

27
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:06,477
<i>the history of Judea could be read</i>
<i>by the light of burning towns.</i>

28
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:13,254
<i>If gold was not the harvest...</i>

29
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:16,487
<i>there was a richness of people</i>
<i>to be gathered.</i>

30
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:21,018
<i>The battalions of Caesar Augustus</i>
<i>brought in the crop.</i>

31
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:28,560
<i>Like sheep from their own green fields...</i>

32
00:11:29,638 --> 00:11:31,765
<i>the Jews went to the slaughter.</i>

33
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:44,917
<i>They went from the stone quarries</i>
<i>to build Rome's triumphal arches.</i>

34
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,928
<i>But Caesar could find no Jew</i>
<i>to press Rome's laws...</i>

35
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:57,927
<i>on this fallen land.</i>

36
00:11:59,602 --> 00:12:04,630
<i>So Caesar named one Herod the Great,</i>
<i>an Arab of the Bedouin tribe...</i>

37
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,842
<i>as the new, false,</i>
<i>and maleficent King of the Jews.</i>

38
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:18,245
<i>But from the dust at Herod's feet,</i>
<i>rebellions of Jews rose up.</i>

39
00:12:19,455 --> 00:12:22,720
<i>And Herod, in reply, planted evil seeds...</i>

40
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:27,789
<i>from which forests of Roman crosses</i>
<i>grew high on Jerusalem's hills.</i>

41
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,823
<i>And Herod the Great, passing pleased...</i>

42
00:12:32,268 --> 00:12:35,032
<i>bade the forest multiply.</i>

43
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:43,438
<i>Yet, trapped in this darkness,</i>
<i>the Jews survived...</i>

44
00:12:44,046 --> 00:12:45,707
<i>by one promise:</i>

45
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:49,706
<i>God would send the Messiah</i>
<i>to deliver them forth.</i>

46
00:12:57,927 --> 00:12:59,986
<i>And it came to pass in those days...</i>

47
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:02,690
<i>that a decree went out</i>
<i>from Caesar Augustus...</i>

48
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,129
<i>that all the world should be taxed.</i>

49
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:08,759
<i>And all went to be taxed,</i>
<i>everyone into his own city.</i>

50
00:13:09,104 --> 00:13:11,572
<i>So it was that Joseph, a carpenter...</i>

51
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,106
<i>went up from Galilee, unto Bethlehem...</i>

52
00:13:14,176 --> 00:13:16,804
<i>to be taxed</i>
<i>with his espoused wife, Mary...</i>

53
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:19,043
<i>who was with Holy Child.</i>

54
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:23,946
<i>He found his own city</i>
<i>much corrupted by Rome.</i>

55
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:44,797
Are you the innkeeper?

56
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,568
There is no room. No room,
not even for a fly to squeeze in.

57
00:13:50,446 --> 00:13:54,109
Please, it's not for me. It's for my wife.
She's expecting a child.

58
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:56,344
You can find a place in the street!

59
00:13:57,353 --> 00:13:59,514
She's expecting her child tonight.

60
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,755
Maybe I can give you a stall in the stable.

61
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:16,831
We will have to spend the night
in the stable.

62
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:27,710
<i>Now, when this Holy Child was born</i>
<i>in Bethlehem of Judea...</i>

63
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:31,012
<i>three wise men came from the east.</i>

64
00:14:31,887 --> 00:14:35,880
<i>These were Caspar,</i>
<i>Melchior and Balthazar...</i>

65
00:14:36,825 --> 00:14:39,350
<i>of Mesopotamia, Persia and Ethiopia.</i>

66
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:20,991
A King of Judea, born in a stable?

67
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,464
What kind of mockery is this?

68
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,134
Herod is the only King in Judea.
Who is this pretender?

69
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,869
Is there something in your scriptures...

70
00:16:32,941 --> 00:16:35,136
about a new Messiah
being born at this time?

71
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,943
False messiahs are born
under every cloud, Your Majesty.

72
00:16:42,117 --> 00:16:43,812
What shall we do, my son?

73
00:16:45,854 --> 00:16:49,449
You are my king, Father.
It is for you to command.

74
00:16:50,192 --> 00:16:51,352
Lucius...

75
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:57,497
order all newborn male children
in that town put to the sword.

76
00:16:58,734 --> 00:17:00,531
That is my command, Lucius.

77
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,295
I am a Roman soldier.

78
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,437
I do not murder children.

79
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,843
You are in my service
by command of Caesar.

80
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:13,782
Dare you disobey Caesar?

81
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,640
Mary...

82
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:46,105
while I slept, I heard a voice saying:

83
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:49,378
"Take the child and his mother,
flee into Egypt...

84
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:52,249
"and stay there until you are told
to return."

85
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:58,390
Then we will go.

86
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,936
<i>And so, when Joseph and Mary</i>
<i>fled into Egypt...</i>

87
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:17,541
<i>Herod's men, seeking all newborn sons...</i>

88
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:20,807
<i>did slaughter the innocents of Bethlehem.</i>

89
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:34,293
Not my son!

90
00:18:41,403 --> 00:18:43,098
Help me!

91
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,295
<i>I...</i>

92
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,532
I cannot breathe.

93
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:58,107
Help me to my throne.

94
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:05,016
A king who cannot walk to his own throne
is no longer a king, Father.

95
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,003
Put me on my throne.
I will not die on my knees.

96
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,011
<i>So Herod the Great,</i>
<i>crushed by his many murders...</i>

97
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,722
<i>self-crucified, fell dead.</i>

98
00:20:45,227 --> 00:20:49,027
<i>And Herod Antipas</i>
<i>took murder for his crown.</i>

99
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,268
<i>And so it was that with Herod's death...</i>

100
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:59,004
<i>Joseph brought his family out of Egypt,</i>
<i>and he took them to Nazareth...</i>

101
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:02,405
<i>where the years passed, numbering 12.</i>

102
00:21:07,482 --> 00:21:09,916
- You are Joseph, the carpenter?
- Yes.

103
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:12,387
My camel litter needs repair.

104
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,720
I'll look at it.

105
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,091
- Peace be to you.
- And to you.

106
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,460
- Refresh yourself.
- Thank you.

107
00:21:22,264 --> 00:21:24,789
- Your son?
- Yes.

108
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,966
And does he like being a carpenter?

109
00:21:29,471 --> 00:21:30,836
Yes, he does.

110
00:21:32,174 --> 00:21:35,837
There's a big world outside this garden,
do you want him to see it?

111
00:21:40,749 --> 00:21:42,546
He will see it soon enough.

112
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:47,286
Let me take him with me. I'll pay you well.

113
00:21:47,589 --> 00:21:50,649
I could use a lad like that
to help me with my caravan.

114
00:21:52,094 --> 00:21:55,325
No. Someday he will leave me...

115
00:21:56,498 --> 00:21:58,591
but someone else will call him.

116
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:00,191
And who will that be?

117
00:22:01,536 --> 00:22:03,663
My son will know him when he comes.

118
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:06,836
I can mend it by tomorrow.

119
00:22:07,376 --> 00:22:08,240
Good.

120
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,476
Have no fear.

121
00:22:14,983 --> 00:22:18,043
We're simply checking the census
against the tax rolls.

122
00:22:19,187 --> 00:22:20,654
Now, you are...

123
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:22,423
Joseph.

124
00:22:22,491 --> 00:22:25,460
- And you live here with your wife, Mary.
- That is so.

125
00:22:26,061 --> 00:22:27,426
Who's this boy?

126
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:29,087
My son, Jesus.

127
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,402
I have no record of his birth.
When was he born?

128
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,835
Twelve years ago.

129
00:22:37,572 --> 00:22:40,040
- Where?
- In Bethlehem.

130
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:53,647
Bethlehem.

131
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:03,797
Count those in the next house.

132
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:11,963
See that the boy is registered
before the year is out.

133
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:20,746
<i>Thus, Joseph's family</i>
<i>were once more forgotten.</i>

134
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:23,741
<i>Twenty years passed.</i>

135
00:23:25,353 --> 00:23:28,379
<i>And Pontius Pilate,</i>
<i>new governor of Judea...</i>

136
00:23:28,457 --> 00:23:30,823
<i>brought fresh armies south and east.</i>

137
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:36,755
<i>But in the hills,</i>
<i>10,000 rebel Jews lay hidden.</i>

138
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:40,364
<i>Their leader, Barabbas,</i>
<i>wanted as criminal and killer...</i>

139
00:23:40,469 --> 00:23:43,029
<i>now baited his traps</i>
<i>for the Roman wolves.</i>

140
00:23:58,286 --> 00:24:00,447
There's too many of them, Barabbas.

141
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:02,212
We will divide them.

142
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,439
- There's a water sign on the hill.
- Make sure it's safe.

143
00:25:00,815 --> 00:25:02,806
There's fresh water ahead, sir.

144
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:06,477
- Shall I give the men a rest?
- Not too long.

145
00:25:07,322 --> 00:25:09,449
Take one column to the waterhole.

146
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,854
Column one, follow me.

147
00:25:14,362 --> 00:25:16,193
Columns, rest!

148
00:25:56,338 --> 00:25:57,737
Give me some wine.

149
00:25:59,941 --> 00:26:01,875
How much farther is Jerusalem?

150
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:03,709
Another day's journey.

151
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:07,441
You should drink water, my husband.
Wine only increases the thirst.

152
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,110
I enjoy it.

153
00:26:17,692 --> 00:26:18,659
Judea.

154
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:21,585
A fine wedding present
your father gave me.

155
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:23,926
My dear Pontius...

156
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:29,500
it is said whoever can govern Jerusalem
can govern anywhere, even Rome.

157
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,805
Do you think Tiberius really has me
in mind as his successor in Rome?

158
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,771
I wish I knew my father's mind...

159
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,975
as well as I know my husband's ambition.

160
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:53,592
<i>And Herod Antipas</i>
<i>rode out to meet Pontius Pilate...</i>

161
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:56,226
<i>and show him the way to Jerusalem.</i>

162
00:27:00,068 --> 00:27:02,901
Another troublemaker. Who is this one?

163
00:27:03,438 --> 00:27:05,633
This one is called John the Baptist.

164
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:09,473
He preaches to the people to repent
before the coming of the Messiah.

165
00:27:09,577 --> 00:27:11,477
I baptize you with water.

166
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:15,844
But one mightier than I
shall come after me.

167
00:27:16,584 --> 00:27:20,042
And he shall baptize you
with the Holy Spirit and with fire.

168
00:27:23,925 --> 00:27:25,825
One more messiah on the way.

169
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:29,895
Will these Jews never tire
of inventing deliverers?

170
00:27:35,637 --> 00:27:38,037
I have heard that name, John the Baptist.

171
00:27:38,606 --> 00:27:41,871
I hear he speaks evil things of me
wherever he goes.

172
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,546
His heart should be ripped from his body.

173
00:27:47,048 --> 00:27:50,984
Your daughter, Herodias,
grows more like her mother day by day.

174
00:27:52,954 --> 00:27:54,512
Do I not please you?

175
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:58,221
My step-daughter
pleases me very much, Salome.

176
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:09,469
Lucius, keep your eye on this man.

177
00:28:10,205 --> 00:28:12,332
One day you'll have to arrest him.

178
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:15,332
- On what grounds?
- On my orders.

179
00:28:17,345 --> 00:28:21,179
I'm bound only to take orders from
the Roman governor when he arrives.

180
00:28:21,249 --> 00:28:24,685
Tell me, Lucius,
what manner of man is Pontius Pilate?

181
00:28:25,553 --> 00:28:27,180
How should I treat him?

182
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,480
What is his weakness?

183
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,025
The same as any man: Vanity.

184
00:29:18,773 --> 00:29:20,502
Call the others to return!

185
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:28,912
Legions, all stand!

186
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:03,338
Barabbas!

187
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:05,508
Barabbas!

188
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:08,665
Who are these men? Bandits?

189
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:12,331
- They call themselves patriots.
- A man named Barabbas leads them.

190
00:33:12,473 --> 00:33:14,065
Have you captured him?

191
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,540
This land is full
of caves and hidden valleys.

192
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:19,079
It'd take half the legions of Rome
to ferret them out.

193
00:33:19,147 --> 00:33:21,741
I want him in chains
before the end of the year.

194
00:33:21,816 --> 00:33:24,114
Putting him in chains would be easy...

195
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,687
but putting our hands on him...

196
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,551
that's what's difficult!

197
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,289
I baptize you with water.

198
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:38,192
But one mightier than I shall come.

199
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:43,428
And he shall baptize you
with the Holy Spirit and with fire.

200
00:33:49,377 --> 00:33:50,674
Are you Elijah?

201
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:53,978
No, I am not.

202
00:33:54,582 --> 00:33:56,072
Are you the Messiah?

203
00:33:58,319 --> 00:33:59,752
No, I am not!

204
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,920
I am the voice of one
crying in the wilderness.

205
00:34:04,392 --> 00:34:06,986
The Messiah is one
who will come after me.

206
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:25,870
You are welcome.

207
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:29,905
Peace be on this house.

208
00:35:33,614 --> 00:35:35,343
What would you have of me?

209
00:35:37,318 --> 00:35:38,785
I seek your son.

210
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,515
My son has gone into the desert.

211
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,958
Why did he come to the river?

212
00:35:47,094 --> 00:35:48,721
For you to baptize him.

213
00:35:50,698 --> 00:35:54,225
He is without sin.
How could I baptize him?

214
00:36:04,445 --> 00:36:06,345
I preach in the wilderness...

215
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:10,575
but the Word must be brought
to Jerusalem.

216
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:13,643
Yet I know I am not the one to deliver it.

217
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:16,483
Only he can.

218
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,653
When his time comes...

219
00:36:22,563 --> 00:36:24,190
he will be there.

220
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:26,795
You say that with sadness.

221
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:29,428
And joy!

222
00:37:11,746 --> 00:37:13,646
<i>And Jesus, baptized...</i>

223
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,973
<i>returned from Jordan,</i>
<i>and went into the wilderness.</i>

224
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:21,217
<i>And with the baptism,</i>
<i>the Holy Spirit came upon him...</i>

225
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:23,280
<i>and a voice said to Jesus:</i>

226
00:37:23,724 --> 00:37:27,922
<i>"Thou art my beloved Son,</i>
<i>in thee I am well pleased. "

227
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:31,554
<i>And Jesus knew the wilderness...</i>

228
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:33,423
<i>its day of heat...</i>

229
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:39,297
<i>its night of cold and solitude.</i>

230
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,370
<i>And stayed himself there</i>
<i>to commune with God...</i>

231
00:37:42,576 --> 00:37:45,306
<i>and strengthen himself</i>
<i>for the times to come.</i>

232
00:37:45,413 --> 00:37:48,507
<i>And ate nothing and hungered.</i>

233
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:51,307
<i>And brought his soul forth in the light...</i>

234
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,177
<i>to be seen of himself and known.</i>

235
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,797
<i>And was 40 days tempted of the devil.</i>

236
00:38:06,634 --> 00:38:08,966
Behold! I am here!

237
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:12,635
Come! I command you!

238
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:18,673
Come! Be tried and found wanting!

239
00:38:20,514 --> 00:38:24,917
If you are the Son of God, command
these stones that they be turned to bread.

240
00:38:27,655 --> 00:38:30,488
Man does not live by bread alone...

241
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:34,150
but by every word of God.

242
00:39:09,397 --> 00:39:10,489
Behold!

243
00:39:11,499 --> 00:39:16,027
I show you all the kingdoms of the world,
in a moment of time.

244
00:39:18,672 --> 00:39:21,436
All this will I give you,
and the glory of them.

245
00:39:22,143 --> 00:39:25,772
If you will worship me, all shall be yours.

246
00:40:15,262 --> 00:40:18,493
Lo! Come to this high place.

247
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:24,097
If you are the Son of God,
cast yourself down from here.

248
00:40:24,538 --> 00:40:28,907
For will not His angels save you
from falling and prevent your death?

249
00:40:30,144 --> 00:40:31,771
Come to the high place.

250
00:40:33,714 --> 00:40:35,045
Be gone!

251
00:40:38,052 --> 00:40:41,215
I worship the Lord my God...

252
00:40:43,457 --> 00:40:45,755
and only to Him do I do service.

253
00:40:50,097 --> 00:40:50,995
Come!

254
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:54,123
Come, if you will...

255
00:40:56,103 --> 00:40:59,766
but I shall not call upon
the Lord my God to stop you.

256
00:41:05,412 --> 00:41:08,745
You shall not force me to put
the Lord my God to the proof.

257
00:41:13,087 --> 00:41:17,547
<i>And when the devil had ended</i>
<i>all his temptations, he departed away.</i>

258
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:31,460
<i>And Jesus came out of the wilderness,</i>
<i>and was seen by men.</i>

259
00:41:41,048 --> 00:41:44,347
There is your new rabbi.
He is the Lamb of God.

260
00:41:53,627 --> 00:41:55,891
<i>And Jesus called those of his choice.</i>

261
00:41:56,897 --> 00:41:59,730
<i>And two of the chosen</i>
<i>were John and Andrew...</i>

262
00:42:00,467 --> 00:42:02,594
<i>and they followed where he led.</i>

263
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,209
<i>And Jesus took himself down</i>
<i>by the Sea of Galilee.</i>

264
00:42:09,543 --> 00:42:13,707
<i>And there did name his third apostle,</i>
<i>and summon him forth on land.</i>

265
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:19,580
Simon! You have been chosen!

266
00:42:26,994 --> 00:42:28,393
You are Simon.

267
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:33,366
You shall be called Peter, the rock...

268
00:42:34,268 --> 00:42:36,065
upon which I will build.

269
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:42,298
What will you have me do, Rabbi?
I am just a fisherman.

270
00:42:44,745 --> 00:42:46,042
Come with me...

271
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:49,580
and I will make you a fisher of men.

272
00:43:02,263 --> 00:43:03,423
Attention.

273
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:24,778
I have just made a tour of the city.

274
00:43:26,053 --> 00:43:28,487
I found no statues, no banners...

275
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:31,182
no emblems of Caesar anywhere.

276
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,156
Where are they?

277
00:43:34,995 --> 00:43:36,792
The Jews have only one god.

278
00:43:38,265 --> 00:43:40,790
Their law forbids
the presence of any image.

279
00:43:42,736 --> 00:43:45,204
Where are the chests
I brought from Rome?

280
00:43:46,407 --> 00:43:47,499
Open them.

281
00:44:13,634 --> 00:44:16,000
A good likeness of Tiberius, is it not?

282
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:19,237
Surely they dare not object
to the Emperor's image.

283
00:44:21,942 --> 00:44:23,307
These people can.

284
00:44:24,178 --> 00:44:25,975
Their law is their religion.

285
00:44:27,147 --> 00:44:29,638
Place them on the pillars of their Temple.

286
00:44:32,853 --> 00:44:34,946
Behold! The sign of the pagan!

287
00:44:36,056 --> 00:44:38,422
As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah...

288
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:42,290
so shall He send hosts
to destroy the idol-worshipers.

289
00:44:43,197 --> 00:44:46,758
The day is coming when the sword
shall descend upon her legions.

290
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:50,331
Her mighty kings and princes
shall grow feeble.

291
00:44:51,004 --> 00:44:53,165
Her stolen treasures made worthless.

292
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,906
Her cities shall crumble into dust.

293
00:44:59,046 --> 00:45:00,946
We shall raise our voice...

294
00:45:02,549 --> 00:45:03,675
and be heard.

295
00:45:03,751 --> 00:45:06,345
Take down the plaques!

296
00:45:10,657 --> 00:45:14,388
<i>When He comes,</i>
<i>He will clear the threshing floor...</i>

297
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,827
<i>and gather the grain into His barns.</i>

298
00:45:17,531 --> 00:45:18,930
<i>But the chaff...</i>

299
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:22,302
<i>He will burn with unquenchable fire.</i>

300
00:45:23,904 --> 00:45:26,634
<i>The shepherds</i>
<i>who lead their flocks astray...</i>

301
00:45:27,107 --> 00:45:28,836
<i>shall be cast out.</i>

302
00:45:30,277 --> 00:45:32,507
<i>The high shall fall.</i>

303
00:45:32,846 --> 00:45:33,938
Make him stop.

304
00:45:34,014 --> 00:45:35,743
<i>And the fallen shall rise.</i>

305
00:45:36,116 --> 00:45:37,310
Draw the curtains.

306
00:45:37,384 --> 00:45:39,648
<i>The cry of the wicked shall fall upon...</i>

307
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,480
It's a very strange voice. Who is that man?

308
00:45:43,056 --> 00:45:44,580
Just another prophet.

309
00:45:45,058 --> 00:45:46,286
An agitator.

310
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,395
Must he agitate beneath your
palace window? Send him away.

311
00:45:50,798 --> 00:45:52,789
The harangue is directed against you...

312
00:45:52,866 --> 00:45:55,494
for mounting graven images
on our Temple walls.

313
00:45:55,969 --> 00:45:59,461
- The incidents in Caesarea were bad.
- The plaques stay.

314
00:46:01,608 --> 00:46:03,439
Do something about this man.

315
00:46:03,577 --> 00:46:05,067
He is harmless.

316
00:46:05,412 --> 00:46:08,540
He gives the people
the type of entertainment they want.

317
00:46:08,816 --> 00:46:10,716
It is not wise to molest him.

318
00:46:10,918 --> 00:46:13,113
My husband is afraid of that madman.

319
00:46:13,287 --> 00:46:15,016
He thinks he's a holy man.

320
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:18,455
A holy man who speaks words of treason.

321
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:22,454
Caiaphas! You are the High Priest
in that man's House of God.

322
00:46:22,763 --> 00:46:24,663
Do you not punish such conduct?

323
00:46:24,731 --> 00:46:29,498
Punishment does not dampen their ardor,
rather it increases their wrath.

324
00:46:30,137 --> 00:46:33,664
We have found it wiser to ignore
the ravings of these false prophets...

325
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:35,469
than to persecute them.

326
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,576
In my opinion, this man seeks martyrdom.

327
00:46:38,979 --> 00:46:41,379
I will put a stop to his voice tomorrow.

328
00:46:41,615 --> 00:46:44,914
Tomorrow! You've been saying that
ever since he came from Jerusalem.

329
00:46:44,985 --> 00:46:46,509
I have given my word.

330
00:46:47,855 --> 00:46:49,880
The word of a king or a puppet?

331
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:54,820
<i>And strip the clothes of the slaves,</i>
<i>and make them go naked.</i>

332
00:46:55,762 --> 00:46:57,093
<i>Men groan...</i>

333
00:46:57,698 --> 00:46:59,563
<i>and the souls of the oppressed...</i>

334
00:46:59,633 --> 00:47:01,225
Go away, you vile man!

335
00:47:05,138 --> 00:47:06,765
Daughter of adultery...

336
00:47:08,108 --> 00:47:10,406
there is but one that can save you.

337
00:47:11,111 --> 00:47:12,476
Go seek Him out.

338
00:47:14,147 --> 00:47:17,913
Kneel at His feet and ask forgiveness
for the sins of your mother.

339
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:21,679
That man is no prophet.
He wears the rags of a beggar.

340
00:47:22,122 --> 00:47:24,420
- It is best to ignore him.
- Ignore him?

341
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:26,823
There is only one way
to deal with a beggar.

342
00:47:26,894 --> 00:47:29,988
You! You, there! Speaker!

343
00:47:30,197 --> 00:47:31,391
Step forward!

344
00:47:47,214 --> 00:47:50,115
You have your alms. Now, be gone!

345
00:47:58,025 --> 00:47:59,515
Bring the beggar in.

346
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:14,339
When Pompey's legions invaded our land,
they slew all the priests in the Temples.

347
00:48:14,675 --> 00:48:18,304
Since then, we have received
our priesthood appointments from Rome.

348
00:48:18,378 --> 00:48:22,075
The people have little love
for any man appointed by your emperor.

349
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:36,428
At night the thief goes out...

350
00:48:38,065 --> 00:48:40,590
in darkness he digs under the <i>house...</i>

351
00:48:41,735 --> 00:48:43,532
Stop! Hold your peace.

352
00:48:48,709 --> 00:48:50,973
- Come with me.
- Take me...

353
00:48:52,579 --> 00:48:55,070
but you cannot stop him
who comes after me.

354
00:48:55,148 --> 00:48:58,675
We will worry about that when it happens.
Come, you foolish man.

355
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,310
Tell me, what is your occupation?

356
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:29,212
I do the bidding of the Lord, my God.

357
00:49:30,651 --> 00:49:32,448
Judging from your appearance...

358
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:35,920
your God seems to be
a rather unprofitable master to serve.

359
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:39,823
I do not seek my reward
in the world you live in.

360
00:49:41,128 --> 00:49:43,392
Nevertheless, you will find one here.

361
00:49:44,431 --> 00:49:47,798
Yes, we do live in a very wicked world.

362
00:49:51,538 --> 00:49:53,972
You frighten me, you angry man.

363
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:56,174
Salome, come back!

364
00:49:59,112 --> 00:50:01,205
This beast amuses me.

365
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,739
Make him dance...

366
00:50:04,317 --> 00:50:06,046
on a bed of hot coals.

367
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:10,784
It were better to cut
his vicious tongue from its roots.

368
00:50:12,192 --> 00:50:13,181
Woman...

369
00:50:14,394 --> 00:50:17,420
is not your cup of abominations
full enough?

370
00:50:19,332 --> 00:50:21,357
You dare to say that to my face?

371
00:50:22,202 --> 00:50:25,194
Get down on your knees
and beg my forgiveness!

372
00:50:26,173 --> 00:50:27,401
You, woman?

373
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:31,610
Who has given herself
to the captains of Assyria?

374
00:50:32,579 --> 00:50:34,308
To the young men of Egypt?

375
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:40,849
Who has deserted her first husband's bed
to live in incestuous lust with his brother?

376
00:50:48,495 --> 00:50:50,486
Is there blood in your veins...

377
00:50:51,598 --> 00:50:52,929
or poison?

378
00:50:55,936 --> 00:50:59,303
Lucius, break his skin with your sword.

379
00:51:03,343 --> 00:51:04,708
I want to see.

380
00:51:06,213 --> 00:51:07,976
Our supper grows cold.

381
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,139
Do you intend to do nothing
with this man?

382
00:51:13,086 --> 00:51:16,180
Herod, Pilate has asked you a question.

383
00:51:20,527 --> 00:51:21,687
Lucius...

384
00:51:22,796 --> 00:51:24,821
take this man to the dungeon.

385
00:51:44,584 --> 00:51:47,747
Would you like me to come
and visit you in your new cave?

386
00:51:49,389 --> 00:51:51,550
You are the seed of evildoers...

387
00:51:52,626 --> 00:51:54,423
the child of corruption.

388
00:51:54,995 --> 00:51:56,895
Leave this house of darkness.

389
00:51:57,364 --> 00:52:00,333
Find your way into the light
while there is yet time.

390
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:09,140
<i>But if some were imprisoned in this day...</i>

391
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,804
<i>yet many another was set free</i>
<i>from the illness of their bodies.</i>

392
00:52:13,313 --> 00:52:17,545
<i>It was the time of miracles,</i>
<i>and Jesus put forth his hand...</i>

393
00:52:17,918 --> 00:52:21,547
<i>and cleansed those who were vexed</i>
<i>with unclean spirits.</i>

394
00:52:22,689 --> 00:52:26,523
<i>For there went virtue out of him,</i>
<i>and healed them all.</i>

395
00:55:03,016 --> 00:55:05,541
I thought you would
leave me here to starve.

396
00:55:07,087 --> 00:55:08,679
What took you so long?

397
00:55:09,656 --> 00:55:13,092
A new prophet has come to Jerusalem.

398
00:55:13,159 --> 00:55:16,720
He has the same first name
as yourself: Jesus.

399
00:55:18,531 --> 00:55:21,022
We need more fighters
and fewer prophets...

400
00:55:21,134 --> 00:55:24,661
except for John the Baptist.
If I had that man on my side...

401
00:55:25,105 --> 00:55:27,767
I could wake up the people,
and we would rid ourselves...

402
00:55:27,841 --> 00:55:29,934
of Antipas and the Romans.

403
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:32,501
This man is greater than John the Baptist.

404
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,573
In what way?

405
00:55:34,948 --> 00:55:37,109
I talked with one of his disciples.

406
00:55:38,451 --> 00:55:39,918
This Jesus...

407
00:55:41,187 --> 00:55:45,419
was proclaimed by John the Baptist
as the man he was waiting for.

408
00:55:51,164 --> 00:55:53,894
I need a prophet
to help me win over the people.

409
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:55,896
Can we convince this man?

410
00:55:57,037 --> 00:55:59,528
His disciple says he speaks only of peace.

411
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:08,842
Peace?

412
00:56:08,915 --> 00:56:12,851
There'll be no peace in Jerusalem,
unless it is won by the sword.

413
00:56:19,659 --> 00:56:21,854
It's not safe for you on the street.

414
00:56:23,596 --> 00:56:25,393
I must speak with this man.

415
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:38,175
What does a man profit,
if he shall gain the whole world...

416
00:56:39,379 --> 00:56:41,108
and lose his own soul?

417
00:56:41,681 --> 00:56:44,844
Could you explain
the parable of the tares of the fields?

418
00:56:45,452 --> 00:56:49,388
He that soweth the good seed
is the Son of Man.

419
00:56:50,523 --> 00:56:52,320
And the field is the world.

420
00:56:57,797 --> 00:57:01,893
We are strangers in your city.
We seek one called John the Baptist.

421
00:57:02,302 --> 00:57:04,429
Can you tell us where to find him?

422
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:22,652
She's evil. Stone her!

423
00:57:22,722 --> 00:57:25,213
- Stone her!
- She's a harlot. She must die!

424
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,319
She's evil. Stone her!

425
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:31,326
- Let her be stoned. She must die.
- She's an adulteress.

426
00:57:31,397 --> 00:57:32,864
What has this woman done?

427
00:57:32,932 --> 00:57:36,800
She's been caught in adultery, and
she must be stoned according to the law.

428
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,770
She's a harlot. She must die!

429
00:57:39,672 --> 00:57:41,765
- Let her be stoned!
- She must die!

430
00:57:42,775 --> 00:57:44,709
She's a harlot. She must die!

431
00:57:45,411 --> 00:57:49,939
Then let him who is without sin
amongst you cast the first stone.

432
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:34,316
Woman, where are they now
who condemned you?

433
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:40,324
Then neither will I condemn you.

434
00:58:41,501 --> 00:58:43,059
Go and sin no more.

435
00:58:51,044 --> 00:58:55,606
If you would find John the Baptist,
he lies in the palace dungeon.

436
00:58:55,982 --> 00:58:58,644
- What was his crime?
- He told the truth.

437
00:58:59,852 --> 00:59:03,049
He may be the one we have waited for.

438
00:59:06,092 --> 00:59:07,650
I must speak with him.

439
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:30,743
<i>And, Barabbas, so near to Jesus...</i>

440
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:33,442
<i>now turned and fled</i>
<i>from the Roman guards.</i>

441
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,984
<i>Leaving behind a man</i>
<i>seeking answers from one stone...</i>

442
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:42,018
<i>whether to run with Barabbas,</i>
<i>the messiah of war...</i>

443
00:59:42,528 --> 00:59:46,191
<i>or walk with Jesus,</i>
<i>the new Messiah of peace.</i>

444
00:59:55,241 --> 00:59:56,333
What is it?

445
00:59:56,442 --> 00:59:58,933
Another one wants
to see John the Baptist.

446
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:01,510
- Send him away.
- He will not go.

447
01:00:01,981 --> 01:00:04,711
I mean, I do not know
how to send this one away.

448
01:00:07,754 --> 01:00:08,914
Show him in.

449
01:00:18,464 --> 01:00:21,194
The prisoner, John, is not allowed visitors.

450
01:00:22,135 --> 01:00:25,298
If you wish to send him a message,
leave it with the guard.

451
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,736
I would see John.

452
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,099
Why?

453
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:33,868
I come to free John.

454
01:00:36,249 --> 01:00:39,616
And just how do you propose
to break him free from his cell?

455
01:00:40,353 --> 01:00:43,254
I come to free him within his cell.

456
01:00:46,492 --> 01:00:48,960
Freedom? Behind stone walls?

457
01:00:51,364 --> 01:00:53,889
You are free
to come and go as you please...

458
01:00:55,101 --> 01:00:59,765
and yet you are still a prisoner because
you place faith in nothing but your sword.

459
01:01:10,316 --> 01:01:12,682
Who are you? Where do you come from?

460
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:16,420
My name is Jesus. I come from Nazareth.

461
01:01:17,323 --> 01:01:18,347
Nazareth?

462
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,026
I have not been there for many years...

463
01:01:24,497 --> 01:01:26,397
yet your face is familiar.

464
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:29,632
You once came to our house
and spoke to my mother.

465
01:01:36,175 --> 01:01:37,972
The house of the carpenter?

466
01:01:41,814 --> 01:01:45,648
For some reason unknown to me,
I have favored your mother once before.

467
01:01:52,592 --> 01:01:55,220
I will give you a moment
with the prisoner, John.

468
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,818
But remember this:

469
01:01:57,430 --> 01:02:01,332
As you have your duty to your God,
so do I to my emperor.

470
01:02:02,402 --> 01:02:03,926
Break Caesar's law...

471
01:02:04,937 --> 01:02:08,168
and you shall find in me
the most merciless of all men.

472
01:02:09,375 --> 01:02:10,740
Ichebious!

473
01:02:14,046 --> 01:02:16,241
Let him take a look at the baptizer.

474
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:35,926
John.

475
01:03:11,471 --> 01:03:13,063
Give me your blessing!

476
01:04:06,959 --> 01:04:09,621
<i>The name of Jesus</i>
<i>moved through the land...</i>

477
01:04:10,196 --> 01:04:12,596
<i>and yet others came to walk with him.</i>

478
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:15,063
<i>And they were Philip and Bartholomew.</i>

479
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,668
<i>And one more joined them near the city.</i>

480
01:04:21,974 --> 01:04:23,669
Take me with you, Rabbi.

481
01:04:26,078 --> 01:04:27,170
Come!

482
01:04:32,919 --> 01:04:34,318
What is your name?

483
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,880
Judas.

484
01:04:36,389 --> 01:04:37,720
- And yours?
- John.

485
01:04:38,558 --> 01:04:42,585
- He's mad!
- He's a madman! Madman!

486
01:05:51,764 --> 01:05:53,231
You are his mother?

487
01:05:53,666 --> 01:05:55,293
Yes. Who has sent you?

488
01:05:56,636 --> 01:05:59,799
I have journeyed from Jerusalem
to see where he lives.

489
01:06:02,008 --> 01:06:03,635
Come, I will show you.

490
01:06:04,877 --> 01:06:06,970
I am alone, now. Share my table.

491
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:09,638
I am a woman of sin.

492
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,748
You will share my table.

493
01:06:22,995 --> 01:06:24,587
I have done much evil.

494
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:29,999
Child, God knows evil exists,
as well as good.

495
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:33,795
Just as there is light and darkness.

496
01:06:35,007 --> 01:06:39,000
Evil exists that we may be
the better for it.

497
01:06:39,178 --> 01:06:41,305
Will you speak to your son for me?

498
01:06:50,556 --> 01:06:51,989
Intercede.

499
01:07:00,166 --> 01:07:01,793
Has not my son said:

500
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:07,202
"What man having 100 sheep,
if he lose one of them...

501
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:11,400
"does not leave the 99 in the wilderness...

502
01:07:11,544 --> 01:07:14,570
"and go after that which is lost,
until he find it?

503
01:07:16,048 --> 01:07:20,485
"And when he has found it,
he lays it upon his shoulders, rejoicing.

504
01:07:24,356 --> 01:07:29,157
"And when he comes home, he calls
his friends and neighbors together...

505
01:07:30,096 --> 01:07:31,893
"and sayeth unto them:

506
01:07:33,365 --> 01:07:34,491
"'Rejoice...

507
01:07:35,668 --> 01:07:37,795
"'for I have found the sheep...

508
01:07:39,171 --> 01:07:40,604
"'which I lost."'

509
01:07:43,042 --> 01:07:46,910
You would not have sought out this house
if God had not wanted you to.

510
01:07:49,215 --> 01:07:50,307
Come.

511
01:07:51,083 --> 01:07:52,380
Share my table.

512
01:08:07,399 --> 01:08:10,527
"Noble Pilate,

513
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:14,929

"they were joined by a sixth disciple...

518
01:08:30,823 --> 01:08:34,623
"a man called Judas Iscariot.
They traveled north.

519
01:08:35,394 --> 01:08:37,589
"The fourth day after the nones of May...

520
01:08:37,663 --> 01:08:41,360
"the man Jesus and his disciples
entered the town of Capernaum.

521
01:08:42,935 --> 01:08:46,871
"There Jesus laid hands on a madman
and cast out the demon in him.

522
01:08:48,507 --> 01:08:52,466
"The same evening, the man Jesus
brought a dying child back to health.

523
01:08:52,578 --> 01:08:54,443
"Two miracles in one day! "

524
01:08:55,247 --> 01:08:56,544
But, <i>Lucius...</i>

525
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,677
These <i>things...</i>

526
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:03,082
Can they really be true?

527
01:09:04,089 --> 01:09:05,716
I do not know, my lady.

528
01:09:06,325 --> 01:09:08,589
I, myself, have never seen a miracle.

529
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:13,294
There are no such things as miracles.

530
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:16,295
Only fools who believe in them. Continue.

531
01:09:16,769 --> 01:09:18,930
"The day after the nones of June...

532
01:09:19,205 --> 01:09:21,230
"at the crossroads...

533
01:09:21,307 --> 01:09:24,799
"a Roman tax collector
by the name of Matthew saw Jesus pass...

534
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:27,838
"and promptly left
his tax collecting duties...

535
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:31,906
"and has joined up with the man Jesus
and become the seventh disciple.

536
01:09:32,451 --> 01:09:35,511
"A harlot from Jerusalem
by the name of Magdalene...

537
01:09:36,155 --> 01:09:38,521
"is also residing in the same house."

538
01:09:38,691 --> 01:09:40,955
Tax collectors and harlots!

539
01:09:41,727 --> 01:09:43,957
"The day before the nones of July...

540
01:09:44,897 --> 01:09:49,425
"the man Jesus spoke to a crowd of over
5,000 people at the foot of Mount Tabor...

541
01:09:49,835 --> 01:09:51,462
"near Lake Galilee.

542
01:09:52,004 --> 01:09:54,131
"Lt is reported that
with a basket containing...

543
01:09:54,206 --> 01:09:56,504
"two fish and five loaves of bread...

544
01:09:57,409 --> 01:10:00,037
"the man Jesus fed the entire multitude."

545
01:10:01,013 --> 01:10:03,277
I never heard such absolute nonsense!

546
01:10:06,218 --> 01:10:11,053
"The day after the ides of July, Jesus was
seen to walk on the water of Lake Galilee."

547
01:10:13,492 --> 01:10:14,652
Ridiculous!

548
01:10:15,828 --> 01:10:20,322
"That evening a storm ravaged the lake,
threatening the lives of fishermen.

549
01:10:20,900 --> 01:10:22,868
"The man Jesus raised his arm...

550
01:10:23,135 --> 01:10:26,662
- Does our Lucius mock me?
- <i>''...the</i> wind died, the storm ceased."

551
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:35,169
So it is reported.

552
01:10:46,859 --> 01:10:50,920
<i>Then Lucius, thinking on Nazareth,</i>
<i>the long years...</i>

553
01:10:51,297 --> 01:10:54,289
<i>the mother, the child, and the miracles...</i>

554
01:10:55,134 --> 01:10:57,261
<i>did go to see John the Baptist.</i>

555
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,244
You have treated me well.

556
01:11:12,217 --> 01:11:15,345
I should like to ask
just one more kindness.

557
01:11:15,621 --> 01:11:16,519
Ask!

558
01:11:19,258 --> 01:11:21,089
Before I leave this world...

559
01:11:22,428 --> 01:11:24,589
I would send a message to Jesus.

560
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:28,823
What is the message?

561
01:11:29,668 --> 01:11:31,761
Ask of him, in these words:

562
01:11:35,507 --> 01:11:37,907
"Was it your coming that was foretold...

563
01:11:39,478 --> 01:11:41,571
<i>''...or</i> are we to expect another? "

564
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,012
You doubt him?

565
01:11:48,587 --> 01:11:50,054
I do not doubt him.

566
01:11:51,757 --> 01:11:55,488
But I would like to hear it
from his own lips.

567
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:59,056
You are always looking at her.

568
01:13:00,392 --> 01:13:02,326
You are sick with jealousy.

569
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,804
Dance for me, Salome!

570
01:13:29,788 --> 01:13:31,085
Salome.

571
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:33,814
Drink a little wine!

572
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:36,453
Taste it...

573
01:13:37,229 --> 01:13:39,220
so that I may drain the cup.

574
01:13:40,032 --> 01:13:41,397
I am not thirsty.

575
01:13:43,268 --> 01:13:44,963
Come and sit next to me.

576
01:13:47,639 --> 01:13:50,870
I will give you the throne of your mother.

577
01:13:54,113 --> 01:13:56,047
You are not enough of a king.

578
01:13:56,615 --> 01:13:59,243
You keep the man
who reviled my mother in a dungeon...

579
01:13:59,318 --> 01:14:01,650
when he should have died months ago.

580
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,551
Why do you let him live?

581
01:14:06,892 --> 01:14:08,621
I have had talks with him.

582
01:14:09,461 --> 01:14:11,361
John is a very great prophet.

583
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:14,260
He's a madman, and you are afraid of him.

584
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,329
I am afraid of no man!

585
01:14:21,507 --> 01:14:24,635
Salome, dance for me.

586
01:14:26,178 --> 01:14:28,146
I command you to dance!

587
01:14:29,248 --> 01:14:30,806
I will not dance.

588
01:14:32,317 --> 01:14:34,012
You cannot refuse me.

589
01:14:34,786 --> 01:14:37,346
Salome will now dance for us!

590
01:14:37,656 --> 01:14:39,248
I do refuse!

591
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:45,091
Salome, I beg of you.
I will give you anything you want.

592
01:14:46,131 --> 01:14:49,100
- Anything?
- Even unto the half of my kingdom.

593
01:14:50,335 --> 01:14:51,563
Do you swear?

594
01:14:53,005 --> 01:14:57,305
By my life, by my crown,
and before the Governor of Judea.

595
01:14:59,344 --> 01:15:02,142
Whatever it is you want,
I will give it to you...

596
01:15:03,482 --> 01:15:06,246
even if it is the throne of your mother.

597
01:15:09,655 --> 01:15:11,384
You have given your word.

598
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:17,695
I'm the slave of my word...

599
01:15:19,398 --> 01:15:22,026
and my word is the word of a king.

600
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,276
Anything I want?

601
01:17:47,446 --> 01:17:50,574
Now, Salome,
what would you have for your dance?

602
01:17:52,884 --> 01:17:53,908
I want...

603
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:56,449
on a silver <i>platter...</i>

604
01:17:56,621 --> 01:18:00,455
What on a silver platter?
A ruby? A diamond? A pearl?

605
01:18:03,395 --> 01:18:05,590
I want the head of John the Baptist.

606
01:18:13,605 --> 01:18:15,004
Have you gone mad?

607
01:18:20,412 --> 01:18:23,540
What can you want
with the head of a man?

608
01:18:24,983 --> 01:18:26,507
I want to look at it.

609
01:18:30,822 --> 01:18:32,346
Salome, listen to me.

610
01:18:32,758 --> 01:18:35,056
I have jewels hidden in this palace...

611
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:37,784
jewels that thy mother even
has never seen.

612
01:18:37,863 --> 01:18:40,127
Jewels that are marvelous to look at.

613
01:18:40,265 --> 01:18:41,527
Great topazes!

614
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,199
Opals that burn with a fire as cold as ice!

615
01:18:46,838 --> 01:18:49,204
Give me the head of John the Baptist...

616
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:52,075
or let it be known to everyone here...

617
01:18:52,778 --> 01:18:55,269
that the word of the king is worthless.

618
01:19:39,424 --> 01:19:41,085
Give her what she asks.

619
01:20:01,146 --> 01:20:04,274
<i>John the Baptist</i>
<i>has sent a message to ask me:</i>

620
01:20:05,784 --> 01:20:10,687
<i>"Is it your coming that was foretold,</i>
<i>or are we to expect another?"</i>

621
01:20:12,591 --> 01:20:15,059
<i>My answer to John is your testimony.</i>

622
01:20:16,094 --> 01:20:18,289
<i>What you people here have witnessed:</i>

623
01:20:19,331 --> 01:20:21,231
<i>How the blind see once more.</i>

624
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,399
<i>How the lame walk.</i>

625
01:20:23,735 --> 01:20:26,465
<i>The lepers are made clean.</i>
<i>The deaf now hear.</i>

626
01:20:28,273 --> 01:20:30,741
<i>I say to John,</i>
<i>"What was it you expected to see...</i>

627
01:20:30,809 --> 01:20:33,539
<i>"when you went out into the desert?"</i>

628
01:20:33,678 --> 01:20:35,873
<i>Was it a reed trembling in the wind?</i>

629
01:20:37,182 --> 01:20:39,776
<i>No, that is not what you expected to see.</i>

630
01:20:40,819 --> 01:20:43,287
<i>Was it a man, clad in fine garments?</i>

631
01:20:44,723 --> 01:20:49,717
<i>No! You must look in king's palaces for</i>
<i>proudly-dressed men who live in luxury.</i>

632
01:20:51,696 --> 01:20:53,425
<i>Why, then, did he go out?</i>

633
01:20:55,166 --> 01:20:56,531
<i>To see a prophet?</i>

634
01:20:58,904 --> 01:21:00,929
<i>I say to John the Baptist:</i>

635
01:21:02,173 --> 01:21:04,437
<i>"Blessed is he who keeps his faith."</i>

636
01:21:05,844 --> 01:21:07,903
<i>And I further say to all of you:</i>

637
01:21:09,214 --> 01:21:11,978
<i>"God has raised up</i>
<i>no greater son of woman...</i>

638
01:21:13,318 --> 01:21:15,115
<i>"than John the Baptist."</i>

639
01:21:57,326 --> 01:22:01,990
All over Galilee the disciples of Jesus are
calling for a gathering to hear him speak.

640
01:22:02,264 --> 01:22:05,427
This new prophet, Jesus,
he speaks like John the Baptist.

641
01:22:05,901 --> 01:22:07,994
How do we know it's not the same man?

642
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:10,334
Perhaps John has risen from the dead.

643
01:22:11,907 --> 01:22:13,272
Why did I do it?

644
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:16,302
I am not an evil man.

645
01:22:19,047 --> 01:22:20,139
Why did I do it?

646
01:22:20,215 --> 01:22:22,683
You should've done it
the day you imprisoned him.

647
01:22:22,751 --> 01:22:24,082
He's John the Baptist.

648
01:22:24,153 --> 01:22:25,643
He's come back as Jesus.

649
01:22:25,721 --> 01:22:28,087
Superstition! Tell him it is not true!

650
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:30,986
I knew John the Baptist
and I have met Jesus.

651
01:22:31,326 --> 01:22:33,055
They are not the same man.

652
01:22:33,529 --> 01:22:35,724
Stop him. Call your soldiers.

653
01:22:36,331 --> 01:22:37,457
Arrest him!

654
01:22:37,799 --> 01:22:39,164
And start a rebellion?

655
01:22:39,234 --> 01:22:41,065
All Rome wants is peace and taxes.

656
01:22:41,136 --> 01:22:44,162
I don't intend to spend
all my life in this miserable country.

657
01:22:44,239 --> 01:22:46,469
Where is this gathering
taking place, Lucius?

658
01:22:46,542 --> 01:22:48,567
A mount in the hills of Galilee.

659
01:22:51,413 --> 01:22:52,880
Have you any suggestion?

660
01:22:52,948 --> 01:22:55,382
Not until I hear what the man speaks.

661
01:22:57,553 --> 01:22:59,350
Go to this meeting, Lucius.

662
01:22:59,588 --> 01:23:01,783
Let the man talk. Listen to him.

663
01:23:02,491 --> 01:23:05,289
If he utters a single word
treasonable to Rome...

664
01:23:06,395 --> 01:23:07,987
you'll have to act.

665
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,198
I tell you,
it is John the Baptist rising again!

666
01:23:21,109 --> 01:23:24,169
<i>And so much was the fame</i>
<i>that went abroad of Jesus...</i>

667
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:28,006
<i>that there was a gathering of people,</i>
<i>like flocks from the hills.</i>

668
01:23:28,083 --> 01:23:31,143
<i>Great multitudes came</i>
<i>out of all Judea and Jerusalem...</i>

669
01:23:31,587 --> 01:23:34,215
<i>and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon...</i>

670
01:23:34,323 --> 01:23:36,917
<i>which came to hear him, and to be healed.</i>

671
01:24:16,965 --> 01:24:19,934
My lady, it is not safe
for Pilate's wife to be here.

672
01:24:20,836 --> 01:24:22,326
I must hear this man.

673
01:24:23,639 --> 01:24:25,573
Will you stay with me, Lucius?

674
01:24:55,237 --> 01:24:58,104
They have all gathered,
and are awaiting your word.

675
01:26:20,088 --> 01:26:22,215
Blessed are you who are poor...

676
01:26:24,059 --> 01:26:26,584
for yours is the kingdom of Heaven.

677
01:26:29,664 --> 01:26:33,896
Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth.

678
01:26:36,171 --> 01:26:39,732
Blessed are you who do
hunger and thirst after righteousness...

679
01:26:41,243 --> 01:26:43,040
for you shall be filled.

680
01:26:44,279 --> 01:26:47,771
Blessed are those who are merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy.

681
01:26:49,785 --> 01:26:54,381
And blessed are those who are mourners,
for they shall be comforted.

682
01:26:55,223 --> 01:26:58,386
Blessed are those who are pure in heart...

683
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:00,894
for they shall see God.

684
01:27:02,397 --> 01:27:05,230
And blessed are you
who are the peacemakers...

685
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:08,497
for you shall be called the children of God.

686
01:27:10,539 --> 01:27:14,600
And blessed are you who are persecuted
for righteousness' sake...

687
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:19,873
for yours is the Kingdom of Heaven.

688
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,783
Give us a sign from Heaven!
Prove to us who you are.

689
01:27:30,392 --> 01:27:32,952
Blessed are you
when men shall curse you...

690
01:27:33,995 --> 01:27:37,021
and separate you from their company,
and reproach you...

691
01:27:38,333 --> 01:27:41,029
and cast out your name as evil...

692
01:27:42,704 --> 01:27:44,899
for the Son of Man's sake.

693
01:27:45,006 --> 01:27:48,066
When?
When is the Kingdom of God coming?

694
01:27:48,944 --> 01:27:51,538
Watch as you may,
you will not see it come.

695
01:27:52,047 --> 01:27:55,380
No one will say,
"Here it is," or, "There it is."

696
01:27:57,652 --> 01:28:00,382
For the Kingdom of God is within you.

697
01:28:00,522 --> 01:28:01,750
Rabbi!

698
01:28:02,524 --> 01:28:05,357
What must I do to inherit eternal life?

699
01:28:07,796 --> 01:28:09,593
What is written in the law:

700
01:28:11,366 --> 01:28:14,096
To love the Lord, your God,
with all your heart...

701
01:28:14,970 --> 01:28:16,460
with all your soul...

702
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:20,135
with all your power and all your mind.

703
01:28:21,743 --> 01:28:24,268
And love your neighbor
as you love yourself.

704
01:28:25,413 --> 01:28:27,643
Do that and you shall live eternally.

705
01:28:27,716 --> 01:28:31,243
I'm a camel driver.
Who can I call neighbor?

706
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:34,514
He to whom you show mercy
and compassion...

707
01:28:35,290 --> 01:28:37,451
whether you know him or not.

708
01:28:38,426 --> 01:28:40,189
Are you the Messiah?

709
01:28:42,097 --> 01:28:43,928
I am the Good Shepherd.

710
01:28:43,999 --> 01:28:46,900
The Good Shepherd lays down his life
for his sheep.

711
01:28:46,968 --> 01:28:49,903
Do you speak against
the law of the prophets?

712
01:28:50,105 --> 01:28:52,972
I come not to destroy
the law or the prophets...

713
01:28:54,309 --> 01:28:55,936
but to fulfill them.

714
01:28:58,046 --> 01:28:59,911
For I say unto you:

715
01:29:00,916 --> 01:29:04,716
Love your enemies,
bless them who curse you...

716
01:29:05,720 --> 01:29:09,622
and pray for those
who despise and persecute you.

717
01:29:11,059 --> 01:29:13,619
For if you love only those who love you...

718
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:16,997
what reward shall you have?

719
01:29:17,465 --> 01:29:19,228
If you are a holy man...

720
01:29:19,801 --> 01:29:23,100
why do you eat and drink
with sinners and tax collectors?

721
01:29:24,940 --> 01:29:28,273
The healthy have no need of a physician,
but the sick do.

722
01:29:28,977 --> 01:29:32,344
I come not to call the righteous,
but sinners, to repentance.

723
01:29:32,414 --> 01:29:33,904
I am a tax collector.

724
01:29:33,982 --> 01:29:37,179
I worship in the Temple every day,
yet they despise me.

725
01:29:37,252 --> 01:29:38,742
What can I do?

726
01:29:39,854 --> 01:29:42,152
No man can serve two masters.

727
01:29:42,591 --> 01:29:45,253
Either he will hate the one
and love the other...

728
01:29:45,327 --> 01:29:47,795
or cling to the one and despise the other.

729
01:29:47,862 --> 01:29:50,194
You cannot serve God and Mammon.

730
01:29:51,066 --> 01:29:52,863
And I say unto you:

731
01:29:54,669 --> 01:29:56,660
Be not anxious for your life...

732
01:29:57,939 --> 01:29:59,839
for the food you eat...

733
01:30:00,575 --> 01:30:03,601
or for your body or the clothes you wear...

734
01:30:05,513 --> 01:30:08,380
for is not life greater than food?

735
01:30:09,017 --> 01:30:11,713
And your bodies more than the clothing?

736
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:17,117
Behold the birds of the sky.

737
01:30:19,894 --> 01:30:24,729
They neither sow nor reap,
nor take their harvest to the barns.

738
01:30:24,799 --> 01:30:27,131
And yet God feeds them.

739
01:30:29,004 --> 01:30:31,564
How much more are you than they?

740
01:30:33,475 --> 01:30:36,376
Consider the lilies of the field
and how they grow.

741
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:40,170
They toil not, neither do they spin.

742
01:30:40,815 --> 01:30:44,876
And can anyone of you, by worrying...

743
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:47,650
add a moment to your years?

744
01:30:53,428 --> 01:30:56,693
My wife and I believe in you,
but we are poor.

745
01:30:56,865 --> 01:31:00,562
We have nothing to give.
How can we show you our faith?

746
01:31:04,039 --> 01:31:06,371
You have, by what you have said.

747
01:31:09,377 --> 01:31:13,837
Come to me,
all of you who labor and are heavy-laden...

748
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:17,277
and I will refresh you.

749
01:31:18,186 --> 01:31:19,483
Rabbi!

750
01:31:20,155 --> 01:31:23,750
Rabbi, I believe you're the Messiah.
How can I serve you?

751
01:31:23,892 --> 01:31:27,089
The Son of Man comes to serve,
not to be served.

752
01:31:28,930 --> 01:31:33,264
Whoever among you who would be great
must be a servant.

753
01:31:34,636 --> 01:31:39,266
And whoever will be first
must be the slave of all.

754
01:31:40,775 --> 01:31:43,869
We have heard the voices
of false messiahs before.

755
01:31:44,145 --> 01:31:46,875
How do we know
you are not sent by Satan?

756
01:31:47,982 --> 01:31:52,817
If a kingdom is divided against itself,
the kingdom cannot stand.

757
01:31:53,855 --> 01:31:58,519
If Satan also be divided against himself,
how then can his kingdom stand?

758
01:31:59,060 --> 01:32:01,290
How can Satan cast out Satan?

759
01:32:08,303 --> 01:32:12,262
I see before me flesh and blood.
You are only a man.

760
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:16,306
Why do you make yourself
out to be the Son of God?

761
01:32:17,445 --> 01:32:20,744
If I am not doing the deeds of my Father,
do not believe me.

762
01:32:22,117 --> 01:32:25,518
But if I am doing them
and you will still not believe in me...

763
01:32:27,055 --> 01:32:29,182
believe in the work I do.

764
01:32:31,025 --> 01:32:33,687
If you can do miracles,
call upon God to send hosts...

765
01:32:33,762 --> 01:32:36,629
to destroy the Romans
and free our people from bondage.

766
01:32:36,698 --> 01:32:39,394
Thou shalt not tempt the Lord, thy God.

767
01:32:40,635 --> 01:32:42,694
The Romans are conquerors.

768
01:32:43,438 --> 01:32:46,874
To conquer them would make you
no different than they.

769
01:32:47,275 --> 01:32:49,368
Rabbi, what is faith?

770
01:32:50,345 --> 01:32:54,941
If you have faith that is no greater
than this grain of mustard seed...

771
01:32:57,152 --> 01:33:00,212
and say to the mountain,
"You shall <i>move''...</i>

772
01:33:01,623 --> 01:33:03,648
the mountain will move.

773
01:33:04,259 --> 01:33:05,920
Nothing is impossible.

774
01:33:07,162 --> 01:33:09,153
How judge a transgressor?

775
01:33:10,698 --> 01:33:12,928
Judge not, lest you be judged.

776
01:33:13,301 --> 01:33:17,328
For you will be judged by the standards
you yourself shall apply.

777
01:33:19,474 --> 01:33:22,773
Why do you note the speck
in your brother's eye...

778
01:33:23,278 --> 01:33:26,475
and take no notice
of the beam in your own eye?

779
01:33:28,383 --> 01:33:33,218
You hypocrites,
first remove the beam from your own eye.

780
01:33:33,288 --> 01:33:37,748
Then you will see clearly enough
to remove the speck from your brother's.

781
01:33:42,063 --> 01:33:44,759
Give not that which is holy to dogs.

782
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:50,667
Neither cast your pearls before swine,
lest they trample them under their feet...

783
01:33:51,206 --> 01:33:53,606
and then turn and tear you to pieces.

784
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:01,749
Ask, and you shall receive.

785
01:34:03,484 --> 01:34:05,452
Seek, and you shall find.

786
01:34:06,354 --> 01:34:09,187
Knock, and the door
shall be opened unto you.

787
01:34:11,860 --> 01:34:15,057
For everyone who asks receives.

788
01:34:16,431 --> 01:34:18,058
And every seeker finds.

789
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:22,633
And to all those who knock,
the door is opened.

790
01:34:25,273 --> 01:34:27,366
Is there a man among you...

791
01:34:28,409 --> 01:34:31,708
who would hand his son a stone
if he asked for bread?

792
01:34:32,447 --> 01:34:34,881
Or a serpent if he asked for fish?

793
01:34:37,285 --> 01:34:40,152
Lf, then, you who are evil...

794
01:34:41,422 --> 01:34:44,414
know how to give your children
what is good...

795
01:34:44,692 --> 01:34:47,058
think how much more
your heavenly Father...

796
01:34:47,128 --> 01:34:50,120
will give good things
to those who ask Him?

797
01:34:51,232 --> 01:34:55,635
Therefore, treat your fellow man
as you would have him treat you.

798
01:34:57,505 --> 01:35:01,305
For this is the law of the prophets.

799
01:35:13,788 --> 01:35:15,415
Teach us to pray.

800
01:35:40,615 --> 01:35:44,278
Our Father, who art in heaven...

801
01:35:46,187 --> 01:35:47,984
Hallowed be thy Name.

802
01:35:50,658 --> 01:35:52,285
Thy kingdom come.

803
01:35:53,962 --> 01:35:56,988
Thy will be done,
On earth as it is in heaven.

804
01:35:57,966 --> 01:36:02,733
Give us this day our daily bread.
And forgive us our trespasses...

805
01:36:04,038 --> 01:36:07,098
As we forgive those
who trespass against us.

806
01:36:08,276 --> 01:36:12,303
And lead us not into temptation,
But deliver us from evil.

807
01:36:16,484 --> 01:36:20,215
For thine is the kingdom...

808
01:36:22,056 --> 01:36:25,548
and the power, and the glory...

809
01:36:27,161 --> 01:36:28,822
for ever and ever.

810
01:36:31,132 --> 01:36:32,224
Amen.

811
01:37:14,375 --> 01:37:15,535
Words.

812
01:37:18,646 --> 01:37:20,739
The Rabbi is calling you.

813
01:37:28,289 --> 01:37:31,554
Your friend is one of those
who did not understand.

814
01:38:03,858 --> 01:38:05,655
What did the man say?

815
01:38:07,628 --> 01:38:10,563
He spoke of peace...

816
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:13,765
Iove...

817
01:38:14,936 --> 01:38:17,166
and the brotherhood of man.

818
01:38:17,872 --> 01:38:19,271
Is that all?

819
01:38:21,409 --> 01:38:22,808
That is all.

820
01:38:32,887 --> 01:38:34,616
What is the matter?

821
01:38:35,389 --> 01:38:37,380
The look on Lucius' face.

822
01:38:38,226 --> 01:38:40,694
He had a long journey. He looked tired.

823
01:38:42,096 --> 01:38:44,690
He looked more than tired to my eyes.

824
01:38:50,705 --> 01:38:52,366
Good night, Caiaphas.

825
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:54,874
- Do you believe in him?
- I do.

826
01:38:54,942 --> 01:38:57,274
Self-appointed saviors like your Jesus...

827
01:38:57,345 --> 01:38:59,973
might stir the people up
against the Romans.

828
01:39:00,214 --> 01:39:03,206
- But he is a good man.
- You are a fool, Nicodemus.

829
01:39:04,185 --> 01:39:06,176
Good or bad, he's a threat.

830
01:39:06,254 --> 01:39:09,314
If Pilate could use Jesus and his followers
as an excuse...

831
01:39:09,390 --> 01:39:11,984
he would massacre our people.

832
01:39:12,059 --> 01:39:14,254
What do you intend to do, Caiaphas?

833
01:39:14,328 --> 01:39:17,593
For the present, we will bide our time.

834
01:39:24,772 --> 01:39:28,799
<i>Then Jesus called unto him his disciples,</i>
<i>the chosen 12...</i>

835
01:39:28,876 --> 01:39:30,741
<i>whom he also named Apostles...</i>

836
01:39:30,811 --> 01:39:33,211
<i>and led them into the wilderness.</i>

837
01:39:34,682 --> 01:39:38,049
<i>And these were Simon, called Peter,</i>
<i>and Andrew...</i>

838
01:39:38,119 --> 01:39:40,587
<i>James and John, the sons of Zebedee...</i>

839
01:39:40,655 --> 01:39:43,351
<i>Philip and Bartholomew,</i>
<i>Matthew and Thomas.</i>

840
01:39:43,424 --> 01:39:45,722
<i>And James, the son of Alphaeus.</i>

841
01:39:45,793 --> 01:39:48,489
<i>Thaddaeus, Simon the Canaanite.</i>

842
01:39:49,497 --> 01:39:52,898
<i>And among them, Judas Iscariot.</i>

843
01:39:57,371 --> 01:40:00,135
<i>Now, none of these chosen</i>
<i>were most learned.</i>

844
01:40:00,208 --> 01:40:04,076
<i>None was a teacher of great truths.</i>
<i>None was rich and powerful.</i>

845
01:40:04,145 --> 01:40:07,979
<i>They but knew the waters of Galilee,</i>
<i>the shores and fields beyond.</i>

846
01:40:08,049 --> 01:40:11,507
<i>But knowing this,</i>
<i>they were most rare, simple and precious.</i>

847
01:40:11,586 --> 01:40:15,818
<i>For they were the pure in heart</i>
<i>and but needed instruction.</i>

848
01:40:19,894 --> 01:40:22,727
<i>For Jesus saw his own disciples</i>
<i>doubt him.</i>

849
01:40:23,130 --> 01:40:25,598
<i>Awed by his miracles, faithful to him.</i>

850
01:40:25,666 --> 01:40:27,759
<i>Still they wondered why the Messiah...</i>

851
01:40:27,835 --> 01:40:31,498
<i>could not raise up miraculous armies</i>
<i>to strike Judea free.</i>

852
01:40:31,572 --> 01:40:35,599
<i>Could simple love and brotherhood</i>
<i>be weapons against Rome?</i>

853
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:42,681
<i>For the disciples, like the multitudes...</i>

854
01:40:42,783 --> 01:40:45,217
<i>were troubled</i>
<i>by the Sermon on the Mount.</i>

855
01:40:45,286 --> 01:40:48,551
<i>They had come seeking</i>
<i>earthquakes and whirlwinds...</i>

856
01:40:48,623 --> 01:40:51,421
<i>the word of Jesus to smite the heavens...</i>

857
01:40:51,492 --> 01:40:54,484
<i>drop fiery swords in their upraised hands...</i>

858
01:40:54,562 --> 01:40:57,190
<i>drown Caesar's chariots in the sea.</i>

859
01:40:57,865 --> 01:41:00,060
<i>This, then, was Jesus' task:</i>

860
01:41:00,134 --> 01:41:03,365
<i>To keep his disciples</i>
<i>from the doubting cities.</i>

861
01:41:03,437 --> 01:41:07,567
<i>To give them fresh wisdom wherewith</i>
<i>to cleanse themselves, as with water.</i>

862
01:41:07,642 --> 01:41:09,940
<i>To make them men of God.</i>

863
01:41:10,578 --> 01:41:13,274
<i>Peace and love he taught them,</i>
<i>in many tongues.</i>

864
01:41:13,347 --> 01:41:16,646
<i>And the days passed,</i>
<i>and the time of teaching was at an end.</i>

865
01:41:17,518 --> 01:41:20,851
And those we help,
how shall they reward us?

866
01:41:21,389 --> 01:41:25,086
You receive without payment,
give without payment.

867
01:41:25,159 --> 01:41:29,152
Take neither gold, nor silver, nor copper
under your belts.

868
01:41:30,264 --> 01:41:31,595
Nor staffs.

869
01:41:32,233 --> 01:41:34,929
You send us out sheep among wolves.

870
01:41:36,337 --> 01:41:40,740
Then be as wise as the serpent,
and as harmless as the dove.

871
01:41:41,742 --> 01:41:46,179
And at the appointed time,
I will join you in Jerusalem.

872
01:41:48,082 --> 01:41:51,677
<i>And he blessed them and</i>
<i>sent them two by two before his face...</i>

873
01:41:51,752 --> 01:41:56,018
<i>into every city and place to heal the sick,</i>
<i>to preach the Kingdom of God...</i>

874
01:41:56,090 --> 01:41:58,581
<i>and to have authority over evil.</i>

875
01:42:07,535 --> 01:42:10,527
Yes, there is rust.
And the water is too warm.

876
01:42:11,305 --> 01:42:14,763
It can only mean one thing:
Someone is forging weapons.

877
01:42:15,276 --> 01:42:18,507
Blacksmiths can operate only
in the western end of the city.

878
01:42:18,579 --> 01:42:22,208
These waters come from
the underground cellar in the eastern end.

879
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:24,918
Can you locate this cellar?

880
01:42:24,985 --> 01:42:27,453
The eastern end
is honeycombed with cellars.

881
01:42:27,521 --> 01:42:29,512
Some we could never find.

882
01:42:31,659 --> 01:42:33,217
You should not have killed this man.

883
01:42:33,294 --> 01:42:35,159
You should have saved him
for questioning.

884
01:43:23,277 --> 01:43:26,940
Go on!
Make more weapons to kill more people.

885
01:43:27,715 --> 01:43:29,273
That is what I intend.

886
01:43:29,350 --> 01:43:31,784
But while the metal cools, think!

887
01:43:32,453 --> 01:43:36,321
- You saw Jesus, you heard him speak.
- He speaks only of peace!

888
01:43:36,624 --> 01:43:40,788
I am fire. He is water.
How can we ever meet?

889
01:43:42,696 --> 01:43:47,030
The day after the next Sabbath,
Jesus comes here to join his disciples.

890
01:43:47,868 --> 01:43:50,666
- Here, in Jerusalem?
- In Jerusalem.

891
01:43:50,905 --> 01:43:54,432
To preach
at the greatest Temple in all the land!

892
01:43:54,508 --> 01:43:57,909
Such crowds will gather,
the Romans will not dare touch him.

893
01:43:58,012 --> 01:44:00,310
Then, Barabbas, is the time.

894
01:44:00,481 --> 01:44:04,281
Move your men to stand by Jesus,
but keep their swords sheathed.

895
01:44:04,552 --> 01:44:07,248
Let your strength be known, but silent.

896
01:44:07,788 --> 01:44:09,688
Let Jesus speak.

897
01:44:09,757 --> 01:44:12,920
When his message of peace
sweeps the city...

898
01:44:12,993 --> 01:44:15,985
let the people proclaim him King of Judea.

899
01:44:17,832 --> 01:44:19,231
How can he refuse?

900
01:44:26,240 --> 01:44:29,038
If he can free the Jews
without spilling blood...

901
01:44:29,777 --> 01:44:31,802
he deserves the crown.

902
01:44:33,147 --> 01:44:36,844
I'll shape the crown myself,
and place it on his brow.

903
01:44:45,759 --> 01:44:48,785
You will stand beside him
in the Temple, then?

904
01:44:49,797 --> 01:44:52,129
You will give him time to speak?

905
01:44:53,467 --> 01:44:54,525
Yes.

906
01:45:02,510 --> 01:45:05,035
That will be a day to be remembered.

907
01:45:10,918 --> 01:45:13,887
- It will be remembered.
- Barabbas!

908
01:45:16,223 --> 01:45:17,690
Judas dreams.

909
01:45:18,659 --> 01:45:23,119
And all dreamers are fools!
This is the hour that we have waited for.

910
01:45:23,430 --> 01:45:24,488
Yes!

911
01:45:24,932 --> 01:45:28,868
Jesus comes to the Temple. Let him!
He brings us our audience.

912
01:45:30,104 --> 01:45:31,662
We'll borrow them.

913
01:45:32,439 --> 01:45:35,465
We'll run them through the streets
to the fortress.

914
01:45:35,776 --> 01:45:36,743
This way, and that.

915
01:45:37,144 --> 01:45:39,635
- Your people, Seth, will storm the gates!
- Yes.

916
01:45:39,713 --> 01:45:42,614
- Yours, Enoch, will breach the north wall.
- Right.

917
01:45:42,683 --> 01:45:44,844
I will scale the wall to the south.

918
01:45:44,919 --> 01:45:48,685
Quickly done and over,
we will lend the crowd back to Jesus.

919
01:45:50,558 --> 01:45:54,050
- Is that fair or not?
- Yes, fair!

920
01:50:45,018 --> 01:50:48,078
No one but Barabbas would attempt
such a thing!

921
01:50:48,188 --> 01:50:50,713
You speak of Barabbas with respect?

922
01:50:52,492 --> 01:50:54,619
I always respect the enemy.

923
01:50:54,695 --> 01:50:57,789
Men like Lucius keep our empire together.

924
01:50:58,131 --> 01:51:01,589
Your tour of duty in Jerusalem
ended years ago, Lucius.

925
01:51:02,569 --> 01:51:04,901
- Why do you stay here?
- Where else would I go?

926
01:51:04,972 --> 01:51:06,997
But Rome is brilliant.

927
01:51:07,908 --> 01:51:10,934
I seem to have a talent
for surviving small wars.

928
01:51:11,144 --> 01:51:14,170
Politics and brilliant society
would destroy me.

929
01:51:14,248 --> 01:51:17,809
Personally, I suspect you found
our Roman gods too cruel.

930
01:51:17,885 --> 01:51:21,321
Are you also awaiting the coming
of the local Messiah?

931
01:51:25,392 --> 01:51:28,657
To believe in the Messiah,
one must believe in God.

932
01:51:29,329 --> 01:51:33,823
What I've witnessed in my years on earth
is proof enough that there can be no God.

933
01:51:34,301 --> 01:51:36,098
How many followers has he?

934
01:51:36,236 --> 01:51:38,727
Who? God? Jesus? Or Barabbas?

935
01:51:39,439 --> 01:51:40,701
Barabbas.

936
01:51:43,744 --> 01:51:46,542
How many dissatisfied Jews
are there in Jerusalem?

937
01:51:46,613 --> 01:51:50,208
Have you considered the possibility
of Jesus' and Barabbas' followers...

938
01:51:50,284 --> 01:51:51,649
joining forces?

939
01:51:51,785 --> 01:51:52,979
I have.

940
01:51:53,687 --> 01:51:55,552
Where would it happen?

941
01:51:56,990 --> 01:51:59,117
Since we are here, here.

942
01:52:11,505 --> 01:52:14,565
<i>And for many months</i>
<i>Jesus preached through Judea...</i>

943
01:52:14,641 --> 01:52:17,132
<i>and angered the scribes</i>
<i>and the Pharisees...</i>

944
01:52:17,210 --> 01:52:20,976
<i>who thought how they might kill him,</i>
<i>and numbered his days.</i>

945
01:52:21,048 --> 01:52:23,039
<i>Knowing the sum thereof...</i>

946
01:52:23,116 --> 01:52:25,414
<i>Jesus came to spend time</i>
<i>with his mother.</i>

947
01:52:56,883 --> 01:52:58,612
Blessings on this house!

948
01:52:58,685 --> 01:53:01,916
Welcome, Peter, John.

949
01:53:02,990 --> 01:53:06,858
We have done all you asked.
It is time we leave for Jerusalem.

950
01:53:09,463 --> 01:53:12,125
The chair will have to wait until I return.

951
01:53:12,265 --> 01:53:14,665
The chair will never be mended.

952
01:53:30,017 --> 01:53:31,780
I am going with you!

953
01:53:34,988 --> 01:53:37,548
<i>Now the Jewish Passover was near...</i>

954
01:53:37,624 --> 01:53:40,024
<i>and many went from the country</i>
<i>to Jerusalem...</i>

955
01:53:40,093 --> 01:53:42,994
<i>to purify themselves and make holiday.</i>

956
01:53:50,037 --> 01:53:51,436
He's coming!

957
01:53:54,241 --> 01:53:57,438
<i>And Jesus, come from Bethany</i>
<i>and the Mount of Olives...</i>

958
01:53:57,511 --> 01:54:01,174
<i>did enter Jerusalem on that day</i>
<i>to preach in the Temple...</i>

959
01:54:01,748 --> 01:54:03,773
<i>for the Temple was Judea.</i>

960
01:54:04,885 --> 01:54:06,910
<i>His words, spoken here...</i>

961
01:54:07,254 --> 01:54:10,382
<i>would echo in</i>
<i>Tiberias, Samaria and Caesarea.</i>

962
01:54:10,457 --> 01:54:14,587
<i>From here he might speak to the world,</i>
<i>if the world might listen...</i>

963
01:54:14,861 --> 01:54:16,886
<i>and the waves be still.</i>

964
01:54:28,742 --> 01:54:32,508
<i>As the city prepared</i>
<i>for the Passover killing of the lamb...</i>

965
01:54:32,579 --> 01:54:36,037
<i>the men of Barabbas</i>
<i>planned stranger celebrations...</i>

966
01:54:36,650 --> 01:54:39,710
<i>made ready more terrible sacrifices.</i>

967
01:55:45,552 --> 01:55:47,349
<i>And Jesus went into the Temple.</i>

968
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:50,184
<i>And the great doors</i>
<i>shut up one multitude...</i>

969
01:55:50,257 --> 01:55:52,225
<i>and within was peace...</i>

970
01:55:54,161 --> 01:55:57,392
<i>while outside</i>
<i>was the sea that would not be stilled.</i>

971
01:55:57,464 --> 01:56:00,661
<i>The tongue which spoke not peace,</i>
<i>but the sword.</i>

972
01:56:03,403 --> 01:56:05,098
Long live Judea!

973
01:56:31,865 --> 01:56:33,025
Judea!

974
01:56:34,935 --> 01:56:36,027
Come.

975
01:57:05,165 --> 01:57:06,189
Get back!

976
01:57:11,571 --> 01:57:12,629
Now!

977
01:57:19,946 --> 01:57:21,174
Come on!

978
02:01:27,794 --> 02:01:29,022
Help me.

979
02:01:37,604 --> 02:01:40,164
We will never rise again.

980
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:43,006
The glory of Judea is dead.

981
02:01:43,543 --> 02:01:46,706
The Romans were waiting for us.
We had no chance.

982
02:01:46,813 --> 02:01:48,838
So many of us dead, for nothing.

983
02:01:48,915 --> 02:01:51,782
We must escape into the desert and hide.

984
02:01:52,719 --> 02:01:57,315
It was you who told Barabbas
the new rabbi would show us the way.

985
02:01:57,957 --> 02:02:00,653
He does nothing but pray in the Temple.

986
02:02:01,628 --> 02:02:03,619
The Rabbi will help us.

987
02:02:03,997 --> 02:02:05,760
How will he help us?

988
02:02:08,001 --> 02:02:09,969
He has the power of miracles.

989
02:02:10,036 --> 02:02:12,664
He will not use his power,
except to heal the sick.

990
02:02:12,739 --> 02:02:16,505
He can call down hosts
to destroy the fortress of Pilate.

991
02:02:17,010 --> 02:02:18,773
He preaches against violence.

992
02:02:18,845 --> 02:02:23,714
He can, with a look, rock the foundations
of Herod Antipas' palace...

993
02:02:23,783 --> 02:02:26,775
and bring the walls down
on the tyrant's head.

994
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:30,988
He has never done these things before.
Why will he change now?

995
02:02:32,058 --> 02:02:33,923
I will force his hand.

996
02:02:34,027 --> 02:02:35,426
Not with us!

997
02:02:38,097 --> 02:02:40,122
I will force his hand.

998
02:02:44,137 --> 02:02:47,300
Once he feels
the Roman sword at his throat...

999
02:02:48,608 --> 02:02:52,738
he will strike them down
with the wave of one arm.

1000
02:03:02,422 --> 02:03:05,050
<i>Now came the days of unleavened bread.</i>

1001
02:03:05,625 --> 02:03:06,819
<i>And Jesus...</i>

1002
02:03:06,893 --> 02:03:09,726
<i>knowing these to be</i>
<i>his final hours on earth...</i>

1003
02:03:09,796 --> 02:03:12,526
<i>did send to prepare a Passover feast.</i>

1004
02:03:12,932 --> 02:03:17,301
<i>And there, a last time,</i>
<i>stood with and among his disciples.</i>

1005
02:03:18,004 --> 02:03:20,871
<i>And gathered them in, all 12.</i>

1006
02:03:46,299 --> 02:03:50,201
Blessed are you, O Lord, our God,
King of the Universe...

1007
02:03:52,071 --> 02:03:54,403
who bids us eat bitter herbs.

1008
02:04:04,050 --> 02:04:06,678
Tonight, one among you will betray me.

1009
02:04:12,358 --> 02:04:14,553
What you must do, do quickly.

1010
02:04:42,955 --> 02:04:45,753
I will be with you for only a short time.

1011
02:04:46,025 --> 02:04:47,788
Where are you going?

1012
02:04:48,127 --> 02:04:51,426
Where I go, you cannot go,
but you will follow me afterwards.

1013
02:04:51,497 --> 02:04:53,897
We'll follow you to the ends of the earth.

1014
02:04:53,966 --> 02:04:56,901
Tonight you will all lose courage
and desert me.

1015
02:04:56,969 --> 02:04:58,095
Impossible.

1016
02:04:59,038 --> 02:05:00,972
I would not desert you.

1017
02:05:01,040 --> 02:05:03,406
I would go to prison. I would die first.

1018
02:05:03,476 --> 02:05:07,037
Believe me, Peter, this night,
before the cock crows twice...

1019
02:05:07,146 --> 02:05:09,876
you will deny knowing me three times.

1020
02:05:10,983 --> 02:05:13,679
- Never!
- No. Impossible!

1021
02:05:13,753 --> 02:05:15,618
We'd never desert you.

1022
02:05:15,955 --> 02:05:17,115
Never.

1023
02:05:19,058 --> 02:05:20,616
My last wish...

1024
02:05:23,096 --> 02:05:25,894
is that you love one another
as I have loved you.

1025
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:31,637
The greatest gift a man can give
is to lay down his life for his friends.

1026
02:05:32,472 --> 02:05:34,963
When I am gone you will be grieved.

1027
02:05:36,309 --> 02:05:38,777
But your grief will turn into joy.

1028
02:05:39,846 --> 02:05:42,110
A woman in childbirth feels pain.

1029
02:05:42,181 --> 02:05:45,912
But when her child is born,
she does not remember the pain.

1030
02:05:46,953 --> 02:05:49,751
For a child has been born into the world.

1031
02:05:51,357 --> 02:05:54,383
And one day I will see you again,
and when I do...

1032
02:05:56,195 --> 02:05:58,163
your joy will be such...

1033
02:05:59,665 --> 02:06:02,259
that no one can take it from you.

1034
02:06:04,470 --> 02:06:06,404
For you have the faith.

1035
02:06:08,941 --> 02:06:12,604
And you believe in me
and in Him, from whom I was sent.

1036
02:06:25,057 --> 02:06:28,618
Blessed are you, O Lord, our God,
King of the Universe...

1037
02:06:30,363 --> 02:06:33,161
who brings forth bread from the earth.

1038
02:06:45,511 --> 02:06:46,603
Take!

1039
02:07:04,730 --> 02:07:05,788
Eat!

1040
02:07:12,638 --> 02:07:14,401
For this is my body.

1041
02:07:23,983 --> 02:07:26,178
Do this in remembrance of me.

1042
02:07:49,008 --> 02:07:51,772
Blessed are you, O Lord, our God...

1043
02:07:53,212 --> 02:07:55,043
King of the Universe...

1044
02:07:56,282 --> 02:07:58,409
who creates the fruit of the vine.

1045
02:08:04,257 --> 02:08:05,417
Drink!

1046
02:08:05,992 --> 02:08:09,723
For this is my blood of the covenant,
which is shed for you...

1047
02:08:12,064 --> 02:08:14,123
and for many...

1048
02:08:14,934 --> 02:08:16,925
for the remission of sins.

1049
02:09:12,425 --> 02:09:15,485
- I wish to see the High Priest Caiaphas.
- It is late.

1050
02:09:15,561 --> 02:09:16,619
He will see me.

1051
02:09:16,696 --> 02:09:18,789
<i>So Judas Iscariot went his way...</i>

1052
02:09:18,864 --> 02:09:22,265
<i>to betray Jesus</i>
<i>to the chief priests and the captains...</i>

1053
02:09:22,335 --> 02:09:24,360
<i>to say how Jesus and Barabbas...</i>

1054
02:09:24,437 --> 02:09:27,668
<i>were the left and the right hands</i>
<i>of the same body.</i>

1055
02:09:27,740 --> 02:09:30,470
<i>Thus Judas thought</i>
<i>to test and prove forever...</i>

1056
02:09:30,543 --> 02:09:32,875
<i>the divine power of the Messiah.</i>

1057
02:09:35,381 --> 02:09:38,214
<i>Then Jesus went forth</i>
<i>to the Mount of Olives...</i>

1058
02:09:38,284 --> 02:09:40,684
<i>and the garden called Gethsemane...</i>

1059
02:09:41,020 --> 02:09:43,750
<i>there to await the dark night ahead...</i>

1060
02:09:44,056 --> 02:09:46,854
<i>there to consider the dark days to follow...</i>

1061
02:09:47,159 --> 02:09:50,526
<i>there to prepare for his trial and his death.</i>

1062
02:10:25,698 --> 02:10:27,461
Keep watch and pray!

1063
02:10:29,168 --> 02:10:30,795
Why must we wait?

1064
02:10:34,173 --> 02:10:35,765
What can I say?

1065
02:10:36,509 --> 02:10:38,943
"Father, save me from this hour? "

1066
02:10:40,980 --> 02:10:44,609
It is for this very reason
that I am coming to this hour.

1067
02:11:25,124 --> 02:11:26,489
My Father.

1068
02:11:47,213 --> 02:11:48,737
My Father.

1069
02:11:51,250 --> 02:11:53,616
All things are possible to you.

1070
02:11:57,756 --> 02:12:00,190
Take away this cup from me.

1071
02:12:43,836 --> 02:12:45,167
And yet...

1072
02:12:49,141 --> 02:12:51,234
not as I will...

1073
02:12:56,949 --> 02:12:58,541
but as You will.

1074
02:14:27,673 --> 02:14:29,698
You were with the man Jesus.

1075
02:14:29,775 --> 02:14:33,734
You are wrong, woman.
I do not know the man Jesus.

1076
02:15:03,509 --> 02:15:05,704
Are you one of the disciples?

1077
02:15:06,679 --> 02:15:08,146
No, I am not.

1078
02:15:12,284 --> 02:15:15,412
- How long will Jesus be in there?
- I don't know.

1079
02:15:21,593 --> 02:15:23,993
You're a disciple.
I saw you in the olive grove.

1080
02:15:24,063 --> 02:15:26,998
I am not. I was not in the olive grove.

1081
02:15:49,054 --> 02:15:51,648
I could swear you were with this man.

1082
02:15:55,627 --> 02:16:00,121
I do not know what you are talking about.
I am not a follower of this man.

1083
02:17:03,128 --> 02:17:05,460
You have been interrogated by Caiaphas.

1084
02:17:05,531 --> 02:17:08,989
They've judged you guilty on two counts:
Blasphemy and sedition.

1085
02:17:09,067 --> 02:17:11,592
This court takes no cognizance
of your blasphemy.

1086
02:17:11,670 --> 02:17:14,571
But the charge of sedition
is a major offense.

1087
02:17:14,640 --> 02:17:17,074
The rules of Roman law will prevail.

1088
02:17:17,142 --> 02:17:19,201
I, Pontius Pilate, Governor of Judea...

1089
02:17:19,278 --> 02:17:23,442
by grace of Emperor Tiberius of Rome,
will judge your case.

1090
02:17:23,515 --> 02:17:27,212
No matter what you've done up to now,
no matter what others accuse you of...

1091
02:17:27,286 --> 02:17:29,481
I, and I alone, have the authority...

1092
02:17:29,555 --> 02:17:32,615
to sentence you
to be crucified or flogged...

1093
02:17:32,691 --> 02:17:33,988
or to set you free.

1094
02:17:34,259 --> 02:17:37,194
How you conduct yourself here
will determine your fate.

1095
02:17:37,262 --> 02:17:38,661
Do you understand?

1096
02:17:43,569 --> 02:17:47,027
I am offering you an opportunity
to state your defense.

1097
02:17:53,045 --> 02:17:56,105
Silence can only serve
to militate against you.

1098
02:17:57,082 --> 02:17:59,915
I'm now offering you a second opportunity.

1099
02:18:05,457 --> 02:18:08,585
In view of the continued
and obstinate silence of the accused...

1100
02:18:08,660 --> 02:18:11,595
the court appoints Lucius Catanus
Advocate of the Defense.

1101
02:18:11,663 --> 02:18:16,066
I wish it emphasized in the record
that the accused has representation.

1102
02:18:28,780 --> 02:18:33,183
I cannot undertake your defense
unless you are willing to confide in me.

1103
02:18:33,652 --> 02:18:36,519
Does the accused
desire to confer with his advocate?

1104
02:18:45,197 --> 02:18:46,824
The trial will proceed.

1105
02:18:50,168 --> 02:18:52,432
For the benefit of the accused...

1106
02:18:53,472 --> 02:18:56,441
so that he comprehends
the gravity of his case...

1107
02:18:57,142 --> 02:18:59,940
I request the charge against him
be repeated.

1108
02:19:01,880 --> 02:19:05,372
The defendant is accused of
claiming to be a leader sent by their God...

1109
02:19:05,617 --> 02:19:08,051
to liberate the Hebrew nation.

1110
02:19:18,497 --> 02:19:22,797
The accused, by neither deed nor word,
has ever challenged Rome's jurisdiction.

1111
02:19:23,569 --> 02:19:27,403
During the past three years,
the accused has in acts and speeches...

1112
02:19:28,440 --> 02:19:30,169
disturbed the people...

1113
02:19:30,242 --> 02:19:33,871
condemned the payment of tribute,
and claimed himself king.

1114
02:19:35,113 --> 02:19:37,479
And spread the word that his kingdom...

1115
02:19:37,749 --> 02:19:40,309
has precedence over and above
Roman jurisdiction.

1116
02:19:40,385 --> 02:19:43,081
The defendant has only spoken
of the Kingdom of God.

1117
02:19:43,155 --> 02:19:46,522
He's never attempted to usurp
Roman jurisdiction over Judea.

1118
02:19:46,592 --> 02:19:50,824
The implication is the same. There can be
no division of authority in Judea.

1119
02:19:50,896 --> 02:19:52,796
A nation can have only one master.

1120
02:19:52,864 --> 02:19:54,297
I repeat, my lord.

1121
02:19:54,366 --> 02:19:56,698
The defendant's claim
to a divine mission...

1122
02:19:56,768 --> 02:19:59,328
does not challenge the authority of Rome.

1123
02:19:59,871 --> 02:20:03,602
The performance of miracles
is beyond the jurisdiction of this court.

1124
02:20:05,644 --> 02:20:08,670
The accused does not stand trial
for miracles...

1125
02:20:08,747 --> 02:20:10,374
but for setting up a kingdom.

1126
02:20:10,449 --> 02:20:14,010
Advocate for the Defense
will confine his argument to the issue.

1127
02:20:16,955 --> 02:20:19,048
The charge is a secular issue.

1128
02:20:19,391 --> 02:20:21,916
By treaty with Judea,
Rome obligated itself...

1129
02:20:21,994 --> 02:20:24,258
not to interfere in religious matters.

1130
02:20:24,329 --> 02:20:26,320
The court is fully aware of this evidence.

1131
02:20:26,398 --> 02:20:28,696
The court is also aware
of the unlawful assembly...

1132
02:20:28,767 --> 02:20:31,531
the accused created
with his Sermon on the Mount.

1133
02:20:31,603 --> 02:20:36,131
I was present at that sermon.
I submitted a report of his statements.

1134
02:20:36,274 --> 02:20:40,108
Not once did he speak a word
that would incite violence.

1135
02:20:40,646 --> 02:20:43,513
On the contrary, he spoke only of peace.

1136
02:20:44,516 --> 02:20:47,314
The court has also read
the report of the sermon.

1137
02:20:47,886 --> 02:20:51,253
He advised people to dispose
their possessions and follow him.

1138
02:20:51,323 --> 02:20:54,815
How can Rome levy taxes on the people
if they follow his teaching?

1139
02:20:54,893 --> 02:20:57,794
Then the charge should be reduced
to one of evading the tax.

1140
02:20:57,863 --> 02:20:59,956
The charge stands as read.

1141
02:21:02,300 --> 02:21:03,824
Are you a king?

1142
02:21:07,506 --> 02:21:10,134
It is your own lips
that have called me King.

1143
02:21:11,009 --> 02:21:13,375
My kingdom is the Kingdom of God.

1144
02:21:14,813 --> 02:21:16,405
Then you are a king.

1145
02:21:19,184 --> 02:21:22,813
I was born and came into this world
to give testimony to the truth.

1146
02:21:24,222 --> 02:21:27,157
Whoever believes in the truth
will listen to me.

1147
02:21:29,928 --> 02:21:31,395
What is truth?

1148
02:21:34,499 --> 02:21:37,730
Everyone that is of the truth
heareth my voice.

1149
02:21:38,470 --> 02:21:40,961
Different people have different feelings.

1150
02:21:41,807 --> 02:21:44,071
Can there not be more than one truth?

1151
02:21:45,343 --> 02:21:49,040
There is only one truth,
and it is written in the Commandments:

1152
02:21:49,648 --> 02:21:51,275
"Be true to God."

1153
02:21:51,450 --> 02:21:55,250
My lord, the court deviates from the issue.
Truth is not on trial here...

1154
02:21:55,320 --> 02:21:57,584
but a man named Jesus, from Nazareth.

1155
02:21:58,256 --> 02:21:59,245
Nazareth.

1156
02:22:00,025 --> 02:22:02,016
You are a Galilean, then?

1157
02:22:02,294 --> 02:22:05,195
In that case,
Herod Antipas has jurisdiction over you.

1158
02:22:05,263 --> 02:22:08,357
He just returned to Jerusalem.
Send him to Herod Antipas...

1159
02:22:08,433 --> 02:22:11,800
My lord, please.
Herod is prejudiced against this man.

1160
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:13,701
He could not be tried fairly there.

1161
02:22:13,772 --> 02:22:17,799
It is so ordered by this court.
The trial has ended. Caesar is satisfied.

1162
02:23:12,364 --> 02:23:15,265
Are you John the Baptist,
come back to life?

1163
02:23:16,034 --> 02:23:18,969
Can you not see he is not
John the Baptist?

1164
02:23:19,037 --> 02:23:20,937
Let him speak for himself!

1165
02:23:23,275 --> 02:23:26,073
I have heard you are
a very great miracle-worker.

1166
02:23:27,179 --> 02:23:31,115
I'd be very happy to witness
a simple demonstration of your power.

1167
02:23:40,025 --> 02:23:41,652
Here is a vase of clay.

1168
02:23:43,995 --> 02:23:46,623
It's only a small vase.

1169
02:23:48,934 --> 02:23:50,595
Turn it into gold.

1170
02:23:54,706 --> 02:23:58,198
Surely that is not a great feat
for a man of your powers.

1171
02:24:12,490 --> 02:24:14,788
Still made of clay.

1172
02:24:17,696 --> 02:24:20,221
Perhaps it was too difficult for you.

1173
02:24:21,499 --> 02:24:24,093
Shall I ask of you something simpler?

1174
02:24:25,270 --> 02:24:26,897
Make it thunder.

1175
02:24:27,839 --> 02:24:30,433
Should be very easy for a messiah.

1176
02:24:32,077 --> 02:24:33,669
Make it thunder.

1177
02:24:54,132 --> 02:24:55,656
I hear nothing.

1178
02:24:57,669 --> 02:25:01,036
It seems the great miracle-worker
has lost his touch.

1179
02:25:03,141 --> 02:25:06,804
Do not let it be said Herod
does not know how to receive royalty.

1180
02:25:26,898 --> 02:25:29,366
Does he not look like a king?

1181
02:25:35,140 --> 02:25:37,870
Take this faker back to Pilate.

1182
02:25:40,779 --> 02:25:44,180
Tell him Herod was not pleased
with his performance.

1183
02:25:57,529 --> 02:26:01,932
Scourge him! Loosen his tongue.
Make him confess.

1184
02:26:08,440 --> 02:26:11,170
What would you want him
to confess, Pilate?

1185
02:26:12,577 --> 02:26:14,977
- His conspiracy.
- What conspiracy?

1186
02:26:16,314 --> 02:26:17,975
Take the miracles.

1187
02:26:18,650 --> 02:26:20,618
What is his crime there?

1188
02:26:23,154 --> 02:26:27,022
He is different
and refuses to behave like the others.

1189
02:26:33,264 --> 02:26:37,928
If he can influence even Caesar's daughter,
he is dangerous.

1190
02:27:49,374 --> 02:27:51,001
What do you want?

1191
02:28:20,772 --> 02:28:22,831
A king should wear a crown.

1192
02:28:58,943 --> 02:29:01,104
If only the sun would set quickly.

1193
02:29:01,679 --> 02:29:03,704
What difference does it make?

1194
02:29:07,385 --> 02:29:09,250
Passover begins at sunset.

1195
02:29:10,021 --> 02:29:12,990
They cannot crucify us
during the holy days.

1196
02:29:13,124 --> 02:29:15,524
I would rather get it over with today.

1197
02:29:27,805 --> 02:29:30,740
How does it feel
to be about to die, Barabbas?

1198
02:29:34,045 --> 02:29:37,572
I only object to the company
that I will have to keep.

1199
02:29:39,817 --> 02:29:43,548
We are only thieves. You're a murderer.

1200
02:29:43,621 --> 02:29:46,181
It is we who should object
to your company.

1201
02:29:46,257 --> 02:29:47,622
Let him be.

1202
02:30:10,582 --> 02:30:13,551
So, I have been given
the honor of going last?

1203
02:30:13,918 --> 02:30:16,819
You know the man named Jesus,
from Nazareth?

1204
02:30:17,422 --> 02:30:18,946
I know the man.

1205
02:30:19,557 --> 02:30:21,457
Does he deserve to die?

1206
02:30:21,993 --> 02:30:24,086
No more than I.

1207
02:30:30,168 --> 02:30:33,103
You compare yourself in the same breath?

1208
02:30:34,973 --> 02:30:39,137
We both seek the same thing. Freedom!

1209
02:30:41,579 --> 02:30:43,547
Only our methods differ.

1210
02:30:46,918 --> 02:30:50,081
The freedom he spoke of
is not the same you killed for.

1211
02:31:00,298 --> 02:31:02,425
When is the man Jesus to die?

1212
02:31:04,802 --> 02:31:07,032
He carries his cross now.

1213
02:31:11,576 --> 02:31:13,601
Why do you tell me all this?

1214
02:31:14,145 --> 02:31:17,171
Why don't you take me with him?
Get it over with.

1215
02:31:21,452 --> 02:31:23,750
Go. You're free.

1216
02:31:35,733 --> 02:31:38,896
The man Jesus is dying in your place.

1217
02:31:40,471 --> 02:31:43,770
One prisoner is freed each year
at this time.

1218
02:31:45,576 --> 02:31:48,067
Pilate offered that mob a choice.

1219
02:31:51,449 --> 02:31:54,282
Me? They chose me?

1220
02:31:57,155 --> 02:31:59,783
Your followers yelled the loudest.

1221
02:32:00,758 --> 02:32:04,387
Go. Look at him who is dying for you.

1222
02:34:21,799 --> 02:34:24,131
You. Cyrenaican. Take the cross.

1223
02:35:27,598 --> 02:35:29,327
Do not weep for me.

1224
02:37:15,973 --> 02:37:20,205
That man is dying in my place.
Why should he do that?

1225
02:37:24,615 --> 02:37:26,810
I never did anything for him.

1226
02:37:47,738 --> 02:37:52,437
Forgive them, Father,
for they know not what they do.

1227
02:38:07,892 --> 02:38:09,951
If you are the Messiah...

1228
02:38:10,861 --> 02:38:14,627
then save yourself and us.

1229
02:38:15,433 --> 02:38:17,401
Have you no fear of God?

1230
02:38:18,235 --> 02:38:19,998
We are guilty!

1231
02:38:20,337 --> 02:38:22,635
But this man has done no wrong.

1232
02:38:25,376 --> 02:38:29,938
Remember me, when we have come
into the glory of your kingdom.

1233
02:38:32,783 --> 02:38:34,250
I promise...

1234
02:38:35,886 --> 02:38:37,911
you will be with me...

1235
02:38:39,056 --> 02:38:41,422
this day, in paradise.

1236
02:38:52,336 --> 02:38:53,564
Woman...

1237
02:38:55,206 --> 02:38:56,969
behold your son.

1238
02:40:09,446 --> 02:40:10,970
My God.

1239
02:40:13,551 --> 02:40:16,452
My God, why have you forsaken me?

1240
02:40:31,068 --> 02:40:34,094
It is finished.

1241
02:40:43,314 --> 02:40:44,542
Father...

1242
02:40:47,451 --> 02:40:50,318
into Your hands I commend my soul.

1243
02:41:26,790 --> 02:41:28,724
He is truly the Christ.

1244
02:42:33,657 --> 02:42:37,787
<i>And the body of Jesus</i>
<i>was begged from Pilate, and given over.</i>

1245
02:43:22,473 --> 02:43:26,569
<i>And in the place where he was crucified,</i>
<i>there was a garden.</i>

1246
02:43:27,444 --> 02:43:31,471
<i>And in the garden a new sepulcher,</i>
<i>hewn from stone.</i>

1247
02:43:32,416 --> 02:43:34,509
<i>And Jesus was placed there.</i>

1248
02:45:33,537 --> 02:45:35,402
Sir!

1249
02:45:40,210 --> 02:45:42,508
Sir, have you hidden him?

1250
02:45:42,579 --> 02:45:45,104
Tell me where, and I will take him away.

1251
02:45:45,182 --> 02:45:46,809
Woman, why do you weep?

1252
02:45:46,884 --> 02:45:50,820
Because you have taken away my Lord.
I know not where.

1253
02:45:54,725 --> 02:45:57,193
- Magdalene.
- Master!

1254
02:45:57,261 --> 02:46:00,628
Touch me not,
for I am not yet ascended to my Father.

1255
02:46:01,131 --> 02:46:03,326
But go to my disciples.

1256
02:46:04,001 --> 02:46:07,562
Tell them I ascend to my Father
and your Father.

1257
02:46:09,473 --> 02:46:12,567
To my God and your God.

1258
02:46:13,944 --> 02:46:16,674
But first, I go before them into Galilee.

1259
02:46:17,848 --> 02:46:19,816
There shall they see me.

1260
02:46:32,296 --> 02:46:33,695
He is arisen.

1261
02:46:46,877 --> 02:46:50,813
<i>And when the tomb was found empty,</i>
<i>some days passed...</i>

1262
02:46:51,682 --> 02:46:55,846
<i>and Christ was seen at Emmaus</i>
<i>and in Jerusalem.</i>

1263
02:46:56,720 --> 02:47:01,123
<i>And those who saw him</i>
<i>knew he was the Lord God.</i>

1264
02:47:02,459 --> 02:47:05,587
<i>And then a final time he came</i>
<i>among his disciples...</i>

1265
02:47:05,662 --> 02:47:07,630
<i>by the shore of Galilee.</i>

1266
02:47:07,698 --> 02:47:09,666
<i>Do you know and love me?</i>

1267
02:47:12,436 --> 02:47:15,633
<i>Feed my sheep,</i>
<i>for my sheep are in all the nations.</i>

1268
02:47:17,274 --> 02:47:19,765
<i>Go you into all the world</i>
<i>and preach the Gospel...</i>

1269
02:47:19,843 --> 02:47:22,403
<i>to every creature who hungers.</i>

1270
02:47:23,247 --> 02:47:25,078
<i>I am with you always.</i>

1271
02:47:26,183 --> 02:47:28,549
<i>Even until the end of the world.</i>

1272
02:50:51,221 --> 02:50:53,212
