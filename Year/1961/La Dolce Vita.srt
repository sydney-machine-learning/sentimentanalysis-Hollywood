Mr. President,

Miss, always ask 
your name, I have 1 4 cousins.

167
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,915
No, it wasn't them yet. 
Have patience, you must forgive me.

168
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,989
What about? Of the time 
you're wasting me?

Yes?

170
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,629

Yup?

00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,275
- Hello? Boss, we have coke! 
- You are crazy? Do not shout!

173
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,789
No, we cannot come down, 
we are being followed.

174
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,509
- They can arrest us. 
- Tell him we have to get rid of it!

175
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,791
- So we throw it away? 
- Throw! It costs 3 million!

176
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,673
Chief, tell the Count 
to go down to the usual coffee.

177
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,673
..and put a coat on a chair. 
We'll put the bottle in his pocket.

178

- Agree. 
- Then we go?

179
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,794
- No, better separate, I can't 
expose myself. - And how do I recognize them?

180
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,151
You sit at the cafe, 
put your coat in evidence, ..

181

But what should I do? What does it do?

198
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,795
What are you doing? Did she dress the baby?

199
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,833

- It doesn't matter, I have many.

If you don't come, I'm offended! 
You have to come with this coat!

It's an honor, but, I say ... 
it's an honor, but ...

It is an honor!

What did you come to do in Rome? 
Did they pass the duty on you?

00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,072
- What do you want?! - Make sure 
you really are a Barbican.

Do you know if he spoke to His Excellency

But where will it go, I say!

228

except me, a Barbican.

- And you ask me? With the President?

251

What time is it?

I'll talk to the Minister.

at the express wish of my grandfather!

only have to leave when you've got the concession.

256
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,269
The money he gave it to me, here it is! 
He told me: '' Stay in Rome as long as you want ''.

257
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,356
Did he give you the money? Let me see!

258

- Let me see! 
- Because?

259

Stop with your hands! 
Let me see! The distrust must end!

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,710
- Did you understand? 
- You don't know money.

261
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,595
However, if you want to stay, you can't 
be dressed like that. You are disgusting!

horse blanket . This coat sucks!

And you suck you and grandpa! 
Go tell him!

265
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,876
- Am I going to tell him such a thing? 
- Then give him a telegram!

266
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,191
Grandfather, you and your coat suck. 
Signed ... stop.

267
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,035
- Go tell him! 
- I shiver! But is it argued like this?

268
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,590
To stay, you need a wardrobe. 
I'll take you to the tailor. Give me the money!

269
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,477
- Come on! 
- Let's waste time.

- That's right. 
- Let's joke around.

271
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,709
- And you didn't catch anything. 
- Let's go to the tailor!

272
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,633

if we have to go to the tailor.

in the talcum powder box.

They can see me and warn my husband.

Didn't he 
accidentally put it in his pocket ?

789
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,474
- I'm the President! 
- Come and confer.

790
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:02,834
Excuse the disorder.

791
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,311
Please take a seat on this side! 
This way. You are welcome!

792
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,071
I was called urgently.

793
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,317
This is the leader of the demonstrators 
who wanted to hear.

794
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:21,591
- Oh yes. - Listen to me. 
- Another day, now I don't have time.

795
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,439
We are 300 
illegal parking attendants. You authorize us.

796
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,597
A word! I can't ask the 
ACl for 300 seats, can I?

797
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,797
- Are too many? - Eh! 
- Well, 300 is a little too much.

798
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,516
- Oh, I say, but ... I'm not a fiasco! 
- To see? He is understanding.

799
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:37,552
I am understanding, yes. 
Well, I want to meet you.

800
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:41,116
- She? - Yes, I'll meet you. 
Let's do this: give the place to me.

801
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,795
- l 299 they make do, poor boys. 
- Cute, selfless.

802
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:48,868
- In fact, I've already prepared my application. 
I signed it. - No question?

803
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,635
Bravo, man to man, 
between gentlemen no question is needed.

804
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,510
Santini, listen to him, I'm pressed. 
I have to go to TV for rehearsals.

805
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,394
- Ah, do you work on TV? - Yeah. 
- It looked like a familiar face!

806
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,391
- Bell tower evening? 
- Not at all!

807
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,229
- The Mystery Object? 
- Not at all!

808
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:09,432
- Anyway, he's good. Let us have fun! 
- Am I playing Pulcinella ?!

809
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,916
- Does Pulcinella? 
- But no! I'm going to the electoral tribune!

810
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,753
Very funny! 
I had a lot of laughs!

811
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,759
- Santini, get him off my feet! 
Here we go! - See you, Excellency!

812
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,670
- Dear Santino, the thing is gone! 
- Come with me, I'll take care of it.

813
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,554
- And when can I come to the service? 
Tomorrow? - How it runs! It's not easy!

814
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:31,394
His Excellency 
said to give me a seat.

815
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,438
Actually, he said: 
'Get him off my feet.'

816
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:39,754
Embè? What does it mean? That until he 
finds my place, I'll be in his way.

817
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,038
Santino, let's stick to orders! 
This bureaucracy! Uff!

818
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:49,836
- Are you in a hurry? - I have 
to be at the courthouse by 11:00.

819
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,157
- Can you leave me at the hairdresser? 
- With pleasure, dear.

820
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,437
- Are you having breakfast at home today? 
- No, I'm at the accountant Candini.

821
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,512
- What are you doing in the afternoon? 
- The usual canasta from Orietta.

822
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:00,919
- Lock. 
- My phones?

823
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:03,920
- Because? 
- So, to hear you.

824
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,032
- I'll see. Do you drive? 
- Yes, I'm driving. - Good.

825
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,713
(TRUMPET SOUND)

826
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,949
Be careful!

827
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,753
(TRUMPET SOUND)

828
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,669
- I told you to be careful. 
- What, dear? - Sound the horn!

829
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:25,830
Do I sound the horn ?! You must be 
a little exhausted, maybe you work too hard.

830
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,518
(TRUMPET SOUND)

831
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:30,713
- But there must be contact! 
- Of course.

832
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,755
(TRUMPET SOUND)

833
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,910
Why do you look behind? 
The horn is in front.

834
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,190
But I feel it from behind. Wait up.

835
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,238
(TRUMPET SOUND)

836
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,033
(TRUMPET SOUND)

837
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:47,116
But the noise comes from here!

838
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:52,835
- Long last! Have you opened, huh? 
- It was she who was playing the trumpet!

839
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,553
- Who put this trumpet 
in my hand? - I do not know?

840
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,029
- Ah, didn't you know? - No! 
- We'll see!

841
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:01,395
&lt;Dear! 
- We have a spare man, dear!

842
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,718
A man? What are you saying?

843
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,515
- Uh! A lady! 
- Well, what are you doing here?

844
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,518
- But who are you? 
- The owner of the car.

845
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,955
- And who put me here? 
- I wish I knew too.

846
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,600
- She kidnapped me! 
- As? - What do you want this?

847
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,797
- The one that was under the tablecloth! 
- What tablecloth?

848
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,236
- What are you waiting for to kick him out ?! 
- Now she is exaggerating! Bait!

849
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,392
- Do not touch me! - How dare you? 
- And she? - He doesn't know who I am!

850
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:28,513
- I have a glorious fallen in the family! 
- I'm calling the guards! - He's crazy!

851
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,637
- Stay calm! - Do not touch me! 
- Let's go up!

852
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,234
- You know what? - Say! 
- You know what? - Say!

853
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:37,595
I don't remember ... wait! 
Horned!

854
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,877
(murmuring) Cuckold!

855
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:51,078
(groaning) Ahi, ahi, ahi.

856
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:54,390
Ohi, ohi, ohi. Ah!

857
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,948
(COLPl) 
Peppino!

858
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,675
(COLPl) 
Peppino!

859
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,153
Peppino, are you there?

860
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,672
Nock If you are there!

861
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:52,592
- Countess! 
- Good morning.

862
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,870
- Good morning, ma'am. 
- Good morning.

863
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:14,515
Scusi.

864
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,037
See you well, madam.

865
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,958
&lt;Man 1: Excellence. 
- Hello.

866
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:27,354
&lt;Man 2: Good morning, honorable. 
- Very expensive.

867
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,917
- Excellence! 
- I can't listen to you, I'm in a hurry.

868
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,152
- And how do we do that? 
- As the ancients did. Here we go!

869
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:49,677
- And how did they do it? - And what do I know! 
Don't you see that you are intrusive?

870
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:53,749
- I know. And the promise? 
- I can't listen to you.

871
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:58,032
- I have to go to TV. I have to change. 
- He looks good dressed like that.

872
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,470
- I feel sick. Pray for me! 
- As? &lt;Pray for me!

873
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,158
And who prays for me?

874
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,995
- Follow that car! 
- Are we in America ?!

875
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,640
- Don't make a fuss! Forward! 
- Okay.

876
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,749
Soon!

877
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,389
SPA offices?

878
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:36,877
Miss, sorry, it's still me. 
That ... the secretary, the cousin.

879
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:42,189
Huh? There is not? 
This is never there, mamma mia!

880
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,194
I spent a hell of a night. 
This Rome is a wrath of God!

881
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:52,316
If I were in the Municipality, here, 
I'd take care of it! Oh, but ... but ....

882
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,753
Eh! The bell ringer has arrived!

883
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,672
- Hello? No ... no ... 
- Is he angry with me? - Sorry.

884
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,679
<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"></font>
Can't that television be turned down?

885
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,069
&gt; Minister: We will fight 
with the people and for the people!

886
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:11,999
&gt; Moderator: The Minister presented 
his party's point of view.

887
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:17,394
The word to the journalists, whom I invite 
to keep within the established times.

888
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,318
So, short questions.

889
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:24,908
- Did he buy the phone? 
- I'm talking! Did you buy it?

890
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:29,352
- No, but ... - I'm entitled to it! 
- Go ahead, but I'm in a hurry, please.

891
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,671
- I'm here first! 
- Talk, but don't waste time!

892
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,998
- Ready! This one is gone! 
- Eh, she's gone ...

893
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,110
- Alright then! Are you happy? 
- I have to call him.

894
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,317
- And phone! 
- And how do I do with her here in front?

895
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:48,312
Please, in short! In short! 
What is that?!

896
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:53,629
Asked by the very clear 
Dr. Minutolo, we answer: it depends.

897
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,630
Very well, I 
am really satisfied.

898
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,473
Antonio Barbacane, of the SPA

899
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,355
Who is it?

900
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:07,472
- I don't know. 
- I think I know him.

901
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:13,677
Honorable Minister, we have known for some time 
that the squatters of the city ...

902
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:18,311
... they live in precarious conditions. 
- Excuse me, but which squatters?

903
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,549
Let me finish.

904
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,556
Someone comes to take his vehicle 
and says: '' Antonio, I have no change ''.

905
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,558
I answer him: '' Oh, look. ''

906
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,677
Someone else who may have stayed 
for 2 or 3 hours gets away with 50 lire.

907
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,397
Someone else still says: 
'' Antonio, I'll pay tomorrow ''.

908
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:43,559
It seems human to her that a wretch 
who has been in the elements all day, ..

909
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:50,034
.. in the evening do you take home, yes and no, 
20-30,000 lire? Let's make the chickens laugh!

910
01:01:50,600 --> 01:01:55,958
Yes, I understand, there are holidays 
where the work increases and increasing ..

911
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:02,395
..you have to do this, to bring 
home 40, 45, 50,000, go!

912
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:05,755
It's all dripping fat, Excellency.

913
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,760
- In short, who are you? 
&lt;The President of the SPA, ..

914
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,350
..National Abusive Posteggiatori Union 
. - But how did he get in?

915
01:02:12,440 --> 01:02:15,273
I saw the others enter 
and followed them. What, am I stupid?

916
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,193
&lt;Then he entered illegally! 
- Sure, I'm an abusive!

917
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:20,111
(RlSATE)

918
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:24,759
Excuse me, Excellency! Stop 
the transmission! Throw him out!

919
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:27,873
Ah, no, this cannot be done! 
It is not democracy!

920
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,595
- Bravo, Antonio! 
- I'll go to The Hague, if that's the case!

921
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,191
- What are you reading? 
- Nothing!

922
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,476
- What are you reading? 
- Nothing!

923
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:08,473
- Nothing! - Let me see! 
- Nothing! - Let me see!

924
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:12,469
I have your protection. 
You read this, huh?

925
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:14,912
I didn't read, I looked at the pictures.

926
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:18,151
- Shameless that you are nothing else! 
Did you look at the figures? - Eh!

927
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,749
Worse than going at night! 
At your age?

928
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,716
You have to read Mickey Mouse, 
not this stuff here!

929
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:27,879
- And what am I doing with Mickey Mouse? 
- How do you mean?!

930
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:31,154
- Why are you doing with these? 
- I know!

931
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,390
- How would that be ?! 
- Forget it!

932
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:37,516
Rascal! 
You scoundrel who are nothing else!

933
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,560
I'll kill you, you know? Son of a dog!

934
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,629
- Anto '! Antonio! 
- Ueh!

935
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,957
I finally found you! 
I traveled around half of Rome, you know?

936
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:50,192
Without knowing the streets! 
What have you done?

937
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,675
- But ... Antonio! - Oh! 
- Antonio! - Huh?

938
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,318
- How are you dressed? 
- Because?

939
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,153
- What are you doing? 
- Shut up! Shut up!

940
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:02,789
- Shut up! - Because? - Here in Rome 
there are a lot of tax agents!

941

01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:56,175
Sweet life!

1089
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:58,213
- Vedo.
- Full.

1090
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:01,539
- Poker. 
- How badly he tells me today, damn it!

1091
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,133
Excuse me, huh! Sorry.

1092
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:07,731
They have finally arrived! 
Why this delay?

1093
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:10,733
- An engine breakdown. 
- There was a cloth in the engine, ..

1094
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:13,215
..then my cousin .... 
- Yes, I took it off.

1095
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:18,257
- For a fee, look who I brought you! 
- How cute! - I'm going down!

1096
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:20,980
- Who are they? 
- Antonio Barbacane of the SPA

1097
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:22,818
- Renato! 
- Peppino Barbacane.

1098
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:25,812
- Pleasure. - She's gone. 
- I know you, can you introduce yourself?

1099
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:29,450
Uh, we were late! 
It will be the centenary, he is already dead.

1100
01:14:29,540 --> 01:14:31,576
- They lit candles for him. 
- You are crazy?

1101
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:33,776
- But does he breathe? 
- Sure! - And with what?

1102
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,049
With your mouth, with what?

1103
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:38,849
- Because it looks dead. - It seems! 
- What are you doing? - Wait for death. - Ah.

1104
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:41,249
Miss, are you waiting for death?

1105
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:45,409
- But no, it's Jacqueline's grandfather! 
- Giacchettin's grandfather!

1106
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:48,817
- What a beautiful dog! - Mamma Mia! 
- What a beautiful dog!

1107
01:14:48,980 --> 01:14:51,050
- It's wonderful! 
- Mamma Mia!

1108
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:55,639
- And it looks like you! It looks like you! 
- Beautiful! - If you put yourself like this ...

1109
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:59,311
Yes, he jokes ... don't touch them 
too much, these are very ferocious!

1110
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:04,235
- They are the famous Viennese greyhounds. 
- Stupid! He's a toy poodle!

1111
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,835
&lt;Jacqueline: A little whiskey? 
- Thanks.

1112
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,751
- Shall we toast its centenary? 
- Centennial? However!

1113
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,748
He's 100 years old! 
Getting there!

1114
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:20,555
- Long live the granny of Rome! - What do you say? 
Today I celebrate my 100th lover!

1115
01:15:21,160 --> 01:15:24,709
- I get it! Is it going to 101? 
- But no, he has to find the number 100.

1116
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:29,232
- Tried at the bottom right? 
- (laughing) How crazy! Padlocks!

1117
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,836
(in French) It's your turn to 
play the 'Truth Game'!

1118
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,794
Look, you, with that 
dirty provincial air, ..

1119
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:39,269
..in your country they don't wash 
before going to bed?

1120
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,630
We wash in the evening 
and also in the morning.

1121
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,228
- My woman have abandoned me! 
- Oh!

1122
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,398
He cheated on me with something else!

1123
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,190
I suffer it! I suffer!

1124
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:55,919
Oh yes? Do you call them '' I suffer ''? 
Here they are called '' horns ''.

1125
01:15:56,160 --> 01:16:00,517
Anyway, limoncino, don't be mad. 
What do you want? It is weakness of the flesh.

1126
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,919
Meat? Why, my being a vegetable?

1127
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,200
Sayonara, very honorable colnuto.

1128
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:15,359
- Rascal, how dare you ?! 
- But how?! I didn't touch it!

1129
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:18,836
- Exactly! How dare 
you not touch me? - Should I touch her?

1130
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,551
- Do I let myself be offended like that ?! 
- Sir, I tell you!

1131
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:27,351
- His behavior 
is unspeakable! - Yes but....

1132
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:31,189
No man sitting next to Magda 
has ever allowed himself not to touch her.

1133
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:34,596
- Exactly because she is a mother ... 
- Which "mother"? Magda!

1134
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:38,076
What is it ?! Are we kidding? 
Who did you take me for?

1135
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,631
What are they? An ancient Greek prince? 
Leave me alone!

1136
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,711
- Uh, sorry! 
- Permit? Python.

1137
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,711
- Python? 
- Python.

1138
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:53,798
The name is not new to me. Do you have a sister 
named Boa? No '' Bona '', Boa.

1139
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:56,997
I am the Marquis Daniele Augusto 
Maria Fortebraccio Pitoni. And she?

1140
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:00,032
Pardon. I'm Antonio Barbacane. 
Of the Barbican.

1141
01:17:00,520 --> 01:17:05,196
Barbican, huh? Barbican ... Nothing 
to do with Pisacane, I suppose.

1142
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:09,319
No, no, no. That's a Tuscan strain. 
Mine is Etruscan.

1143
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:12,916
I descend from the Etruscan. 
In person, as you can see.

1144
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,913
'' Cave canem '': 
in Latin it would be '' Barbican ''.

1145
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,638
Sayonara. Sayonara. 
Excuse me, are you Chinese?

1146
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,392
- No. 
- Then I was wrong.

1147
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:26,235
Run, come over there, the session begins, 
there are spirits! Here we go!

1148
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,515
Peppino, the session! 
Let's go sit down!

1149
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:31,911
(VOICE) 
Anto ', an orgy has begun!

1150
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:40,590
(VOClARE)

1151
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:44,240
(softly) Silence, silence! 
Slowly!

1152
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,636
Here, here. Shed some light.

1153
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:54,158
(BRUSlO)

1154
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,274
- (shouting) But where are we going? 
- All: Sst!

1155
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,357
- You don't have the session? 
- We were already sitting.

1156
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:08,069
- We've been seated so far. 
- What are you saying? The séance!

1157
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:12,039
- Norma is already in a trance! 
- Ah! Did you understand? Norma is already in the tram!

1158
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:15,311
- In the face of the tram! Do you have loose change? 
- What does that have to do with anything?

1159
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,877
- Come here! 
- Quiet, please!

1160
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:20,835
Aho! Eh!

1161
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,070
- Contact, contact ... 
- Yes, yes ...

1162
01:18:23,240 --> 01:18:25,708
- Let's join hands. 
- And don't break the chain.

1163
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:28,712
The chain does not break, it is pulled. 
Peppino, pull the chain!

1164
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:32,110
- Where is it? - No, shoot here! 
Hands, to you. Shoot at you! - Oh yes.

1165
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,553
&lt;Man: Shut up! 
- Sst!

1166
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,354
- There is? - Oh God? 
- Is there or isn't there?

1167
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:39,273
I'm afraid, I was born seven months, 
Antonio knows.

1168
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,278
- How not? He didn't want to go out! 
&lt;Silence! - Sst!

1169
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,717
We try to make contact 
with the soul of the dead.

1170
01:18:46,600 --> 01:18:48,955
But whose deaths? 
ours or theirs?

1171
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,590
- No, the soul of your dead. 
- theirs, right? - And what, ours?

1172
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:54,272
&lt;Man: Shut up! 
- Yup.

1173
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:57,878
&lt;Man: It seems there are. 
- There is! - There is?

1174
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:02,113
Jacqueline: Norma, if the spirit is there, 
tell me who the chosen one should be.

1175
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:03,795
Who are you?

1176
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:05,715
Who are you?

1177
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:08,276
- Who are you? 
- Peppino, tell him who you are!

1178
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,153
I am Giuseppe Barbacane .... 
(NORMA GRlDA)

1179
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,471
Wretch, what did you say ?!

1180
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,472
Sit down and pull the chain!

1181
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:19,269
(BRUSlO)

1182
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,275
The important thing is to know things.

1183
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,909
- The truth doesn't hurt. 
- Anto '... - Shut up.

1184
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,549
- It is doubt, uncertainty, 
which torments the soul. - Yup.

1185
01:19:30,080 --> 01:19:35,154
- In life and in death, there are 
true things and supposed things. - True.

1186
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:42,314
Let's put the real things aside, 
but where do we put the suppositories?

1187
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,709
&lt;Antonio: For now let's put 
aside the suppositories.

1188
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,950
- Would you like to ask the spirit a question? 
- Yup.

1189
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,554
&lt;Ghost: I 
want to ask a question!

1190
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:52,638
(TUTTl GRlDANO)

1191
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:55,718
Anto '! I am seventh!

1192
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,316
Peppino (groaning): 
Pity for a septet!

1193
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,517
How do you have fun with these 
shit? I was bored.

1194
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:07,638
You're a fool, you know? 
Are they jokes that are made?

1195
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,790
- I feel sick! 
- At the risk of making him die!

1196
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:13,919
- I feel bad! - He feels bad! 
Is there a doctor? A midwife? Someone!

1197
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:18,239
Do you feel bad? A cognac, quick! 
This dies!

1198
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,231
- Give me a cognac! 
- There he is!

1199
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,033
Hurry up, Antonio!

1200
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:28,435
- Soon! - How do you feel now? 
- I feel a little better. - Thank god.

1201
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,910
It's past, thank goodness. 
The session resumes.

1202
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,117
But what do you recover? An accident! 
But does she recover like this?

1203
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:38,556
Do you believe that we are men like you? 
You are rascals!

1204
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:42,150
To scare my cousin, at the risk 
of dying! You are cuckolds!

1205
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:46,028
- Sir, but you offend! 
- Sir, do you know who you're talking to?

1206
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:48,270
- Who are you talking to? 
- Who am I talking to?

1207
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:52,479
- How dare you? - You don't understand 
anything! - It is he who must speak!

1208
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:53,953
- Well? 
- Say!

1209
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:57,795
You speak to the Marquis Daniele 
Augusto Maria Fortebraccio de Pitonis!

1210
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:59,233
(ironic) Eeeh!

1211
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:03,030
And these offenses I wash them 
in one way only: with blood!

1212
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:06,795
- I can not! - Because? 
- I'm anemic! Eziandio, he knows.

1213
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:09,235
- It's true, I .... 
- Mere excuses!

1214
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,036
- Do not withdraw, by now you have gone 
too far! - Yup!

1215
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,158
- There's not one thing to do: 
duel! - A duel.

1216
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,470
- I like the idea. 
- Shall we go blank?

1217
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:22,474
- Yes, I have an ulcer, you know ... 
- Okay in white? - Good.

1218
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:25,279
- Is she there? 
- It fits, in white!

1219
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:29,195
- So, let's do the rapier? 
- We make cod for everyone. - Yup!

1220
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,874
Don't joke! 
I mean: saber or sword?

1221
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:35,915
- Sword? - Three swords! 
- Not necessary! Two are enough!

1222
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:41,109
- Two swords. - Four cups! 
- So we have two glasses.

1223
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:47,031
- This is not a joke and you will notice! 
To the last blood! - Wow!

1224
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:51,029
- Very well! - Last blood! 
- Clear! Go away!

1225
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:55,589
- Where are you going? - Let's go away. 
- You have to stay here!

1226
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:58,520
Gentlemen, make way!

1227
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:01,319
Now I am mounted, I have the nerves!

1228
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:04,597
- I make a mess! 
- Do you really do it? - it?

1229
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:09,549
- The duel? - You are crazy? You do it! 
- it? - He offended us, you're a Barbagallo.

1230
01:22:09,640 --> 01:22:12,712
- But he challenged you! 
- Out of education I left it to you.

1231
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:18,716
Thank you so much, I can't do it. 
For charity! You do not know? I'm seventh!

1232
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:22,475
And what it means? There is the regulation 
for the weeks and for the nine years!

1233
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:26,075
- You get into position. - What do I do? 
- The position of septet.

1234
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:29,630
..and you start with a slash to the right, 
one to the left. I got it?

1235
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,959
- And comes a blow that I do not know. 
- What do you care? The stinker the better!

1236
