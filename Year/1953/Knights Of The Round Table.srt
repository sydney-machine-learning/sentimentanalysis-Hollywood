1
00:01:12,444 --> 00:01:16,031
<i>It befell in the old days that Rome,</i>
at need...

2
00:01:16,115 --> 00:01:18,576
<i>withdrew her legions from England.</i>

3
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:22,621
<i>Then stood the realm</i>
in great darkness and danger...

4
00:01:23,038 --> 00:01:26,125
<i>for every overlord held rule</i>
in his own tower...

5
00:01:26,542 --> 00:01:29,753
<i>and fought with fire and sword</i>
against his fellow.

6
00:01:32,756 --> 00:01:36,552
<i>Then against these dark forces</i>
rose up a new force...

7
00:01:36,844 --> 00:01:38,804
<i>wherein flowered courtesy...</i>

8
00:01:38,888 --> 00:01:41,557
<i>humanity and noble chivalry.</i>

9
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,487
Your kinsmen have been here before us.

10
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:59,116
He is still here.

11
00:02:03,662 --> 00:02:07,082
I cry Morgan Le Fay
rightful Queen of England...

12
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:10,169
and her knight champion, Modred,
Lord of the Isles.

13
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:13,339
I cry Arthur Pendragon, Duke of Gwent.

14
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:22,348
God keep you, stepsister.

15
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:24,308
God spare you, stepbrother.

16
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,436
Merlin the Wise made us meet here,
and we're here.

17
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,896
Do we meet as foes?

18
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:30,523
We meet as kinsmen.

19
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:33,442
To put an end to bloodshed
and restore a throne.

20
00:02:34,193 --> 00:02:36,445
Which of us speaks
as the king of that throne?

21
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:40,032
He who is Uther Pendragon's son
is high king of England.

22
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:43,661
I am the only issue
born to Uther in true wedlock.

23
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:47,039
No son was born to him
by his rightful queen.

24
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:49,542
Yet your father was sire to a son.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,003
- Born in shame.
- His son nonetheless.

26
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,297
Morgan Le Fay is the rightful heir.

27
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:57,299
And Modred the rightful king.

28
00:02:57,383 --> 00:03:02,012
My lady, we are met here so that
he that is rightful king shall prove it.

29
00:03:02,596 --> 00:03:03,681
Come.

30
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:31,041
What words are those
carved upon the stone?

31
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,502
"I am the sword Excalibur.

32
00:03:33,586 --> 00:03:36,088
"Whoso pulleth me from this anvil...

33
00:03:36,297 --> 00:03:39,258
"is the rightwise born king of all England. "

34
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:43,304
How do we know
this is the sword the legend spoke of?

35
00:03:43,387 --> 00:03:46,599
If it be the true sword,
why did Merlin alone know where it lay?

36
00:03:46,682 --> 00:03:49,935
Because the King, Uther Pendragon,
revealed it to me alone...

37
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:52,104
the night before his death.

38
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,774
Then I shall take what is mine.

39
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:11,749
Sire?

40
00:04:33,354 --> 00:04:35,439
That is not the true sword.

41
00:04:35,564 --> 00:04:37,358
It is the true sword.

42
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:39,151
It is witchcraft!

43
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,362
Let no man say otherwise.

44
00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:44,907
Then we must summon a council
at the Ring of Stones...

45
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,742
of the chiefs of all the land.

46
00:04:46,825 --> 00:04:49,745
- They shall decide, my lord.
- Aye.

47
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:55,042
They shall decide to hang thee from a tree,
and all thy witchcraft within.

48
00:04:55,292 --> 00:04:57,628
Though you be the unnatural brother
of this lady...

49
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:00,256
take care you do not hang beside him!

50
00:05:02,007 --> 00:05:05,594
We shall meet again
at the council of the Ring of Stones.

51
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:13,853
The King of England!

52
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,604
You are not.

53
00:05:15,688 --> 00:05:17,189
- What?
- Not yet.

54
00:05:17,982 --> 00:05:21,777
You have still to prove it by deeds,
not words.

55
00:05:22,695 --> 00:05:24,613
Return it to the anvil.

56
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:37,960
<i>With a heart of furious fancies</i>

57
00:05:38,043 --> 00:05:41,172
<i>Whereof I am commander</i>

58
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:45,718
<i>With a burning spear and a horse of air</i>

59
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:49,346
<i>By the wilderness I wander</i>

60
00:05:49,388 --> 00:05:52,850
<i>By a king of ghosts and shadows</i>

61
00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:56,353
<i>I am summoned to a tourney</i>

62
00:05:56,395 --> 00:06:01,066
<i>And leagues beyond the wide world's end</i>

63
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:05,946
<i>Methinks it is no journey</i>

64
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,031
Enough.

65
00:06:07,114 --> 00:06:10,367
My belly's as limp as a bell rope
and as hollow as a broken promise.

66
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:13,787
This Arthur of yours must be 100 leagues
the other side of nowhere...

67
00:06:13,871 --> 00:06:16,040
on a charger made of nothing.

68
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:20,252
Arthur's real enough and man enough
to ride, as we do, in pursuit of glory.

69
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:23,130
Alas, good Lancelot,
how far, in the name of reason...

70
00:06:23,214 --> 00:06:25,841
will you chase this puffball fancy knight?

71
00:06:25,925 --> 00:06:28,719
Who? Arthur?
To the world's end and beyond.

72
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:30,596
We're there already.

73
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,391
It is the valley of death.
The devil himself has plowed it under.

74
00:06:39,772 --> 00:06:42,775
Not so, good Lancelot.
I hear the song of life.

75
00:06:42,942 --> 00:06:45,152
Sweet music to my hungry ears.

76
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:52,076
Four men against one hen.
Chivalry, hide thy face.

77
00:06:53,452 --> 00:06:56,121
Come, we'll look for something fiercer
as a foe.

78
00:06:56,205 --> 00:07:00,251
Sir, by your leave, my spirit is willing
but my stomach cries for quarter.

79
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:03,587
Eat then, and join me later
at the Ring of Stones.

80
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:11,428
Shall we see King Leogrance
at the Ring of Stones?

81
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,514
Yes, but not his daughter.

82
00:07:13,806 --> 00:07:15,766
Guinevere is here with me now.

83
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:20,312
Here in my heart, as she ever has been
since the day we met as children.

84
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:24,149
And as she always will be,
till the day this heart no longer beats.

85
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:25,359
Kind words.

86
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:29,238
I shall make her queen of all this island.
Queen of all England.

87
00:07:29,864 --> 00:07:32,658
How good the growing
of the unhatched egg.

88
00:07:33,325 --> 00:07:36,036
From hereon this is Modred's land.

89
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,497
I shall travel a different road to you.

90
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:41,375
Go by the downs,
and let me go through the forest.

91
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:43,878
- 'Tis not as we planned.
- It's as I plan it now.

92
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:46,130
- Why?
- If one of us is ambushed...

93
00:07:46,172 --> 00:07:49,341
the other will live to confound Modred
at the Ring of Stones.

94
00:07:49,425 --> 00:07:51,468
Please, God, it will be you.

95
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,012
- Ride with him.
- No.

96
00:07:53,095 --> 00:07:56,473
'Tis your blood Modred seeks, not mine.
Stay with your master.

97
00:07:56,515 --> 00:07:58,309
Ride alone you shall not.

98
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,645
I'll go through the forest
and you shall take Bedivere...

99
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:04,940
or none of us move a step from here
till doomsday.

100
00:08:05,232 --> 00:08:07,985
I see I've been foster-father to a mule.

101
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:09,278
Very well.

102
00:08:09,361 --> 00:08:11,697
Go through the forest, and Godspeed you.

103
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,701
You have always been more a father to me
in wisdom and strength...

104
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:17,745
than he who sired me.

105
00:08:17,828 --> 00:08:21,832
Without you, I endure life.
With you, I rejoice in it.

106
00:08:22,917 --> 00:08:24,168
Godspeed.

107
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:51,737
- Which road has Arthur taken?
- Through the forest.

108
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,531
Sire, what of my reward?

109
00:08:53,614 --> 00:08:55,908
You promised me enough gold
to silence me.

110
00:08:55,991 --> 00:08:59,078
Was there ever enough gold
in Christendom to silence a traitor?

111
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:01,038
Nevertheless, silence him.

112
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,527
Here we part company. Bring me word
to the Ring of Stones when Arthur is dead.

113
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,070
Within the hour.

114
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:44,623
Where would you have gone without me?

115
00:09:44,707 --> 00:09:46,959
To the Council of Kings
at the Ring of Stones.

116
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:48,711
- I do not want you there.
- Why not?

117
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:49,879
Your life might be in peril.

118
00:09:50,796 --> 00:09:53,048
Where you go, there I go also.

119
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,677
Did I have to say as much in words?

120
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,825
Why are you late, sir knight?

121
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:21,827
Why? How late am I, my lady?

122
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:24,705
I've been waiting for you here since dawn.

123
00:10:25,289 --> 00:10:27,625
Alas, my lady. How was I to know?

124
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,002
You should have known by magic.

125
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:32,505
- Magic?
- It's May eve.

126
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,926
I made a wish in the pool
for a knight to come and carry me off.

127
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:39,929
- And I am the knight?
- Of course you are.

128
00:10:40,846 --> 00:10:43,474
- May I ask my lady's name?
- Elaine.

129
00:10:43,849 --> 00:10:46,143
- Of what place?
- Of Astolat.

130
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:49,563
Come nearer. Perhaps you'd like to ride.

131
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:03,327
Where are you taking me?

132
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:06,330
To your home, if you'll tell me where it is.

133
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:23,013
I told you who I was,
but you haven't told me who you are.

134
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:26,058
I am Lancelot of the Lake,
King Ban's son of Benwick.

135
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,018
- Where is Benwick?
- In France.

136
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,187
Then whatever are you doing in England?

137
00:11:30,229 --> 00:11:33,023
I come in search of a great hero
called Arthur Pendragon.

138
00:11:33,107 --> 00:11:34,942
What will you do when you find him?

139
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:37,361
Ride the wide world by his side.

140
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,530
What will you ride in search of?

141
00:11:39,572 --> 00:11:41,615
Giants and unicorns...

142
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:45,160
and beyond England,
the sea of white bears and witch whales.

143
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:48,372
Beyond the sea, the happy islands
where no one ever grows old...

144
00:11:48,455 --> 00:11:51,458
or so Gareth the harper
tells me in his songs.

145
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:53,878
- Have you a lady?
- No.

146
00:11:54,795 --> 00:11:56,839
Then I shall be your lady.

147
00:11:56,922 --> 00:12:00,634
One day you will come back
and take me to the happy islands.

148
00:12:12,771 --> 00:12:15,524
- What is it?
- Nothing that will harm you.

149
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:18,402
Who stands?

150
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:22,364
Come forward and declare thyself!

151
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,911
Why do you seek me?

152
00:12:27,077 --> 00:12:29,705
Why do you lie in hiding like a knave?

153
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:35,503
So it's a nest of knaves.

154
00:12:35,961 --> 00:12:39,381
Good sirs, draw your swords
before my friends arrive.

155
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:42,051
Five to one
is all Arthur himself could hope for.

156
00:12:42,134 --> 00:12:44,637
- Are you Arthur's man?
- To the death.

157
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:46,555
Kill him!

158
00:12:52,645 --> 00:12:55,731
The lists are open.
Who'll tumble in them next?

159
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:10,538
Behind you.

160
00:13:12,248 --> 00:13:13,791
Thanks, my lady.

161
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:23,634
I am for thee, lone knight.

162
00:13:24,343 --> 00:13:26,512
Declare for them or stand off!

163
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:28,222
Not while I live.

164
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:22,193
- I yield. Fair fight.
- Fair fight? Ambush.

165
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:33,370
What now?

166
00:14:33,412 --> 00:14:36,415
Now, my lady,
I shall take you home to supper.

167
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,711
That meddler again.

168
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:45,883
I thank you for the help I did not need.

169
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:50,179
Those are brave words, if hardly grateful.

170
00:14:50,554 --> 00:14:52,431
Do you deny you spoiled my fight?

171
00:14:52,515 --> 00:14:56,060
- Why, do you seek another?
- Do you not owe me one?

172
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:59,522
Come, pay your debts.
With broadswords, if you wish.

173
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:07,071
Sir Lancelot, I'm hungry.

174
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:09,323
I'll be with you in the passing of a minute.

175
00:15:09,406 --> 00:15:12,868
Take care she does not witness
the passing of a knight.

176
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:39,306
I've never met your like before.

177
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:42,560
In combat, you have no peer.

178
00:17:44,228 --> 00:17:46,313
I am Lancelot of the Lake.

179
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:49,567
By the faith of my body,
I must know who you are.

180
00:17:51,944 --> 00:17:53,779
I am Arthur Pendragon.

181
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:09,962
Why do you break a sword
that served you with such might?

182
00:18:10,004 --> 00:18:11,505
It struck you.

183
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:15,801
Then you shall have mine...

184
00:18:16,719 --> 00:18:19,138
and may it serve you half as well.

185
00:18:20,472 --> 00:18:24,185
My lord, while I live,
I shall remember this hour.

186
00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:28,606
I ache in every bone.
I shall not be able to forget it.

187
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:36,238
Stand and declare thyself, plowboy.

188
00:18:36,322 --> 00:18:38,115
I'm no plowboy, sire.

189
00:18:38,324 --> 00:18:42,578
I am Percival of Astolat,
and I ride in search of my sister, Elaine.

190
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:47,625
A thousand pardons to yourself
and to your horse.

191
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:51,378
Yonder is the lady you seek,
I think, asleep and safe.

192
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:13,108
We've been searching
the countryside for you.

193
00:19:13,192 --> 00:19:15,653
- I've been in such a battle.
- A battle?

194
00:19:15,736 --> 00:19:18,113
- We fought five men.
- We?

195
00:19:18,864 --> 00:19:21,867
- This knight and I.
- This knight and you?

196
00:19:23,035 --> 00:19:25,037
He and that other knight.

197
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,497
Who are you?

198
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:30,000
I am Lancelot of Benwick,
and this is Arthur Pendragon.

199
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:35,381
Milord.

200
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:39,301
Milords, let me be your man
and ride with you.

201
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:41,554
Make me a knight errant.

202
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:45,307
- What errant would you seek?
- The Holy Grail, my lord.

203
00:19:48,352 --> 00:19:51,021
Your ambition soars high
for such young wings.

204
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:54,316
Will you not help me
to prove myself worthy of it?

205
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,195
If all goes well with our cause,
seek us at Camelot.

206
00:19:58,404 --> 00:20:01,031
If there is to be war,
seek us upon the battlefield...

207
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:04,535
- and prove yourself in combat.
- I shall, my lord.

208
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:07,037
Thank you.

209
00:20:07,746 --> 00:20:09,206
Come, sister.

210
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,549
Good-bye, Sir Lancelot.

211
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:22,553
I shall be awaiting you
when you return from the happy islands.

212
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:25,055
Till then, my lady, fare you well.

213
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,851
Happy islands? Where are they?

214
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:30,644
Who knows, my lord?

215
00:20:30,728 --> 00:20:33,063
Perhaps in the heart.
Do you not seek them, too?

216
00:20:33,147 --> 00:20:35,608
I know but one island,
and not a happy one.

217
00:20:35,649 --> 00:20:38,569
- My task must be to make it so.
- Where is it?

218
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:41,697
We stand upon it now.

219
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:45,993
It shall be happy, my lord.
We shall make it so.

220
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,301
We are not many people.
We are one people.

221
00:21:02,384 --> 00:21:06,597
Bound together by the sea about us
and our enemies from without.

222
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:11,560
We do not have many causes.
We have one cause: England.

223
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:14,980
England, which now stands in mortal peril.

224
00:21:15,064 --> 00:21:17,233
- We alone can save it.
- How?

225
00:21:17,316 --> 00:21:19,735
There must be an end
to all strife among us...

226
00:21:19,818 --> 00:21:23,405
- to the burning and the killing.
- You're not our judge nor our leader.

227
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,952
But he claims to be our judge
and our leader.

228
00:21:27,993 --> 00:21:29,995
Beware this man, my lords!

229
00:21:30,037 --> 00:21:33,415
He would overthrow the King's true heir
and take the crown himself.

230
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:36,252
I claim from no one
what is not rightfully mine.

231
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:39,046
That from a man
who is not even rightfully born!

232
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:42,341
Let me speak.

233
00:21:43,592 --> 00:21:44,969
My lords...

234
00:21:45,845 --> 00:21:49,056
the true ruler of England is her law.

235
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:52,351
It is as old as these stones...

236
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,145
which were raised
to the measure of the sun...

237
00:21:55,187 --> 00:21:57,314
and the motion of the stars.

238
00:21:58,065 --> 00:22:00,901
Each one is balanced by its neighbor...

239
00:22:00,985 --> 00:22:03,654
with all the cunning of a mason's skill.

240
00:22:04,321 --> 00:22:06,949
If each stone keeps in balance...

241
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:09,535
then all will stand forever.

242
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:12,079
So it is with England.

243
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:16,500
Let each man keep in balance
with his neighbor...

244
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:19,670
and all our world stand still.

245
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:22,173
I am Mar, King of the Picts.

246
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:25,092
Does any man here
dare tell me what I must do?

247
00:22:25,176 --> 00:22:28,721
Not one man, nor a hundred,
nor a hundred thousand...

248
00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:31,891
but the people of England.

249
00:22:31,932 --> 00:22:33,893
In the dark night of their wretchedness...

250
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:37,646
crushed with hunger, fear and misery,
they cry out, "Let there be peace!"

251
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:38,772
Hear him?

252
00:22:38,856 --> 00:22:41,775
He would lead every villein in the land
against his master.

253
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:44,695
He would make us serve the peasants
who were born to serve us.

254
00:22:44,737 --> 00:22:48,324
Who is Arthur Pendragon
to speak such words to kings?

255
00:22:49,408 --> 00:22:51,535
Which of you is a true king?

256
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:55,206
Mar who comes from Rome
with his painted Picts...

257
00:22:55,289 --> 00:22:56,790
and burns this land?

258
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:59,043
Mark and his Cornish pirates?

259
00:22:59,126 --> 00:23:02,046
Bryan and his slave raids
on our unprotected coasts?

260
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:06,675
There is no true king in England until
this council names one and obeys him.

261
00:23:08,302 --> 00:23:11,263
It is ordained that I shall be
the rightful king of England.

262
00:23:11,347 --> 00:23:13,432
I will be king, my lords.

263
00:23:13,516 --> 00:23:16,769
With peace if I can, by war if I must.

264
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,856
Neither I nor my friends
lack bows and spears...

265
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,734
and if the people lack goods,
which you plunder...

266
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:26,320
they do not lack anger nor courage.

267
00:23:26,612 --> 00:23:28,948
- Choose!
- Let the traitor perish...

268
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:31,450
while his treason is still black
upon his lips!

269
00:23:32,368 --> 00:23:33,869
Arthur, ride!

270
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,447
What is it to be, my lord,
Camelot or the battlefield?

271
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:12,116
To the battlefield!

272
00:24:12,158 --> 00:24:14,618
We'll crown you king by Christmas!

273
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:22,668
<i>King of all kings</i>

274
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:26,088
<i>To be her son</i>

275
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:29,300
<i>She chose</i>

276
00:24:30,384 --> 00:24:35,389
<i>He came on so still</i>

277
00:24:36,682 --> 00:24:38,475
Where are you going?

278
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:41,979
Home.

279
00:24:42,563 --> 00:24:45,649
Was your village left standing
by Modred's men?

280
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:46,817
No.

281
00:24:47,193 --> 00:24:51,655
But if I'm to starve to death,
I'd sooner starve to death there than here.

282
00:24:51,822 --> 00:24:53,949
I love this horse like a brother.

283
00:24:54,033 --> 00:24:56,452
I would kill him
and you could eat his flesh...

284
00:24:56,535 --> 00:25:00,539
if it would give you half the courage
of the man you're deserting.

285
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,835
Keep your horse.

286
00:25:06,086 --> 00:25:09,423
<i>King of all kings</i>

287
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:14,178
<i>To be her son</i>

288
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,057
<i>He told</i>

289
00:25:18,474 --> 00:25:21,644
<i>He came on so still</i>

290
00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:24,480
What shall I give thee as a Christmas gift?

291
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:28,526
Fine words from a knave
whose pockets are as empty as his wits.

292
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:30,444
Is this empty?

293
00:25:30,903 --> 00:25:32,738
And a right Merry Christmas to you.

294
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:35,407
And a right Merry Christmas to you,
Sir Gareth.

295
00:25:35,491 --> 00:25:36,992
Gently.

296
00:25:37,451 --> 00:25:40,162
Gawaine's as gentle as a bear
on a bee swarm.

297
00:25:40,246 --> 00:25:42,623
Gareth's too full of festive spirit.

298
00:25:42,748 --> 00:25:46,252
I would I were.
I'm rusting faster than my sword.

299
00:25:46,335 --> 00:25:51,340
<i>I sing of a maiden</i>

300
00:25:51,924 --> 00:25:56,887
<i>That is matchless</i>

301
00:25:58,472 --> 00:26:02,810
<i>King of all kings</i>

302
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:07,064
<i>To be her son</i>

303
00:26:07,147 --> 00:26:10,234
- How is the night?
- Even time has frozen solid.

304
00:26:10,985 --> 00:26:13,445
When should we attack Modred, my lord?

305
00:26:13,529 --> 00:26:16,740
- When the first spring thaws set in.
- Why not now?

306
00:26:16,949 --> 00:26:19,201
No army can fight Modred
and the winter, too.

307
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:22,413
This is not fighting as I know it.
It's a kind of creeping death.

308
00:26:22,496 --> 00:26:26,458
Nevertheless, we are fighting
as surely as if we were in the field.

309
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,550
This is the season of the year
when men give gifts...

310
00:26:34,633 --> 00:26:36,635
to those they most esteem.

311
00:26:38,637 --> 00:26:41,265
I esteem thee more than any other man.

312
00:26:47,313 --> 00:26:49,940
"Friend shall I be. Call me not other.

313
00:26:51,108 --> 00:26:54,028
"This is a pledging
'twixt brother and brother. "

314
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,621
- Christ is born.
- He is born.

315
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:25,369
Does each man know the plan?

316
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:28,622
Every man is in his place
and every man has his orders.

317
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:32,168
Do they but obey them
and Modred will never forget this day.

318
00:28:32,251 --> 00:28:35,754
- Modred will not forget this day.
- May he not live to.

319
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:39,925
May this be the sword
that bids him sweet farewell.

320
00:29:10,372 --> 00:29:13,083
Is that all the strength they can muster?

321
00:29:13,125 --> 00:29:15,127
Old men and lame boys?

322
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,296
The day is ours already.

323
00:29:17,588 --> 00:29:19,256
England is ours already.

324
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,517
Death to Arthur!

325
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,527
Stand and behold, Arthur is dead!

326
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:07,698
The day is mine!

327
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,495
Arthur lives. The day is still ours!

328
00:31:16,665 --> 00:31:17,833
Give ground!

329
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,969
- Give ground?
- Aye. They're in retreat.

330
00:31:29,428 --> 00:31:30,930
Now for the kill.

331
00:31:31,013 --> 00:31:32,598
Pursue and slay!

332
00:32:41,792 --> 00:32:43,252
We have them!

333
00:32:43,335 --> 00:32:45,462
Spurs to horse and death to foe!

334
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,454
Will you see my banner shamed?

335
00:33:18,537 --> 00:33:20,623
Fight the dragon banner to the earth!

336
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,561
He has won his spurs, my liege.

337
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:45,606
He has one hundredfold.
Fight on, Sir Percival.

338
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:47,441
And now for England!

339
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:02,498
Forward!

340
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,125
They fall like apples in a gale!

341
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,873
The day is ours!

342
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,333
Hail to Arthur, King of England!

343
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:06,979
My lords, do you accept
Arthur Pendragon as your king?

344
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:11,567
Then accept also his pardon...

345
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:15,905
whereby he doth absolve you all
from retribution...

346
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,450
so that ye keep the peace of England.

347
00:35:21,076 --> 00:35:24,830
In true penitence, I do confess my wrongs
against King Arthur...

348
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,708
and beg leave to serve him loyally
as his knight.

349
00:35:27,791 --> 00:35:29,752
That leave I freely give.

350
00:35:29,835 --> 00:35:33,422
Sire, I request of thee
that this knight be put to banishment.

351
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,341
Would you have me break my word?

352
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:38,636
The war is over, Lancelot.
I begin my reign in peace and in honor.

353
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:39,929
This man will destroy it!

354
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,890
Sire, must I stand rebuked
by this mongrel knight?

355
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:45,809
- I'll give thee satisfaction.
- Sir Lancelot, stop.

356
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,275
Put up your swords.

357
00:35:54,151 --> 00:35:56,111
Are you knight or outlaw?

358
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,448
Cool your hot blood and keep your place...

359
00:35:59,698 --> 00:36:03,327
which is high enough,
but not above the good of the realm.

360
00:36:07,873 --> 00:36:12,044
Arthur Pendragon will be crowned king
in the city of Camelot.

361
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:16,006
There also will he wed
the Princess Guinevere.

362
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,468
Then shall you all assemble...

363
00:36:19,718 --> 00:36:23,305
to pay homage to him and to his queen.

364
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,099
So be it.

365
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:30,646
I am King Ban's son of Benwick,
rebuked by you before this company.

366
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:33,983
While that man lives,
I will not pay you homage.

367
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:51,041
<i>By the wilderness I wander</i>

368
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,713
<i>By a king of ghosts and shadows</i>

369
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:59,758
<i>I am summoned to a tourney</i>

370
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:05,681
<i>And leagues beyond the wide world's end</i>

371
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:07,683
Sing up, Lancelot.

372
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:09,727
Where's thy voice, Lancelot?

373
00:37:09,768 --> 00:37:13,230
- With thy heart in thy boot?
- Let him be, you rattle bait.

374
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,530
- Whose shields are these?
- Ask whose they were, sir knight.

375
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,782
Are they all three slain?

376
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:26,327
Not slain, would you say, squire?

377
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,997
Not slain, squire,
but put to sad, sore shame.

378
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,375
Our lord and master stripped them of all.

379
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:36,253
Armour, horses, and their lady.

380
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,590
And off they went on foot like penitents.

381
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,425
What lady is this you speak of?

382
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,136
The lady under escort of the three knights.

383
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,055
Didn't send her away.

384
00:37:47,848 --> 00:37:50,476
Then your master is a knave and a dog.

385
00:37:56,482 --> 00:38:00,694
Then by your leave,
we will throw dice for your horse now.

386
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,279
Await me here.

387
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,796
State your purpose.

388
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:22,132
- You hold a lady against her will.
- Perhaps. Not against mine.

389
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:23,884
I bid you let her go free.

390
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,346
If you would free her,
'tis simply done. Slay me first.

391
00:38:27,429 --> 00:38:29,181
That shall be my pleasure.

392
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,100
But heed you fight fiercely.

393
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,810
If I slay you at white heat...

394
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:35,688
then the lady's heart
will melt like butter in my hand.

395
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,941
You will be melting
in another place, sir knight.

396
00:38:39,024 --> 00:38:40,526
Where is the lady?

397
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:44,155
If I am to hazard my shield with you,
she must accept me as champion.

398
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,073
There the lady stands.

399
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:03,174
My lady, will you take me
for your champion?

400
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,384
Tell me first, sire, who are you?

401
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:07,678
He who would be your champion.

402
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,764
And why do you champion my cause?

403
00:39:11,765 --> 00:39:16,353
Because I've seen many wonders,
but none in this world as beautiful as you.

404
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,189
- Sire, she is...
- Brigid.

405
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,610
I take you for my champion, sir knight.

406
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,759
For the lady!

407
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:02,149
He is all bark and no dog, Your Highness.

408
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:14,078
He barks well enough.

409
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,247
Now let us see how he bites.

410
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,707
I cry quarter!

411
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,879
You'll cry in quarters unless you swear
to take the lady where she desires to go.

412
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:26,173
And because you've dishonored
good knights...

413
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,593
you'll give up your armor
and hang your shield on that tree.

414
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,011
I swear it.

415
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,099
Mend thy ways, sire.
There is some good in you.

416
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,643
Guard the lady well.

417
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,979
On my honor.

418
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:05,546
You are free, my lady.
Whither do you go from here?

419
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,175
To the wedding of King Arthur
and Princess Guinevere at Camelot.

420
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,093
Will you ride there with me?

421
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:14,138
I wish it could be so, my lady,
but it cannot.

422
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:18,142
Sir Addle-pate Oaf yonder
will conduct you there in safety.

423
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:21,353
Tell me, sir knight, who are you?

424
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:27,318
Forgive me, my lady,
but there is shame upon my name.

425
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,489
I think that you have never done
a shameful thing...

426
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,073
nor ever will.

427
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,536
For that, may God's mercy
be forever with you.

428
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,831
May God's mercy be forever with you, too.

429
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,472
Every knight in England
must be here today.

430
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,849
I were that Lancelot were here.

431
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,018
To upset another apple cart?

432
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,895
If he upset 100 apple carts...

433
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:06,357
it would be a fair price
for the sight of his face again.

434
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,721
She ever grows more beautiful.

435
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,200
They are ill-matched.

436
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,953
If they are not we will make them so.

437
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,741
Long live King Arthur!

438
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,993
Long live Queen Guinevere!

439
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,205
My lords, come forward...

440
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:28,499
and do each his homage...

441
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,001
as ancient custom doth decree.

442
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,337
My liege.

443
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,923
It is said on this day of great rejoicing...

444
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,175
that any man may ask one favor...

445
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:41,679
and that the King will grant it,
providing it be not against the realm.

446
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,182
That is true, and I will do it
if it be not against the realm.

447
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:47,768
My master asks of you this honor...

448
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,563
that he may be the first to do you homage.

449
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,022
Who is your master?

450
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,693
Sir Lancelot of the Lake,
King Ban's son of Benwick...

451
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,529
Knight Commander
of the armies of England.

452
00:44:58,571 --> 00:45:00,364
I grant his request.

453
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,548
My liege, I am your man,
and by mouth and hands...

454
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,800
I swear to serve your cause
against all others.

455
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,970
I fought Lancelot and lived.

456
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,555
Sir Lancelot...

457
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:28,475
by mouth and hands I swear
we shall not part again.

458
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,313
Sire, forgive my discourtesy
at the Ring of Stones.

459
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:36,108
I rebuked you too sharply,
and I say it before this company.

460
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,278
Pay homage also to your queen.

461
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:44,325
Guinevere, this knight
is my banner, sword and shield.

462
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,917
This is the knight
who came so swift to my rescue.

463
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,294
But so late to my wedding.

464
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:59,840
Sir Lancelot, I thank you
for your rescue of my lady.

465
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:03,719
In gratitude, I make you henceforth
the Queen's champion.

466
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:18,442
I shall ever be in your quarrel
to be your knight in right or in wrong...

467
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:22,154
at the hazard of my body,
from this day forward to my death.

468
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,246
Be thou my champion in right or in wrong.

469
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,757
You stand here in the presence
of your peers...

470
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,677
to become knights of the Round Table.

471
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,806
Therefore each man
shall say aloud this vow:

472
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:51,934
I will fear God...

473
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,936
honor the King...

474
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:58,065
and defend this realm
with honor and with might.

475
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,746
With God's good grace...

476
00:47:12,872 --> 00:47:16,375
I will hold myself true
to this fellowship of knights.

477
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:20,004
In the name of each man here,
I vow in God's name...

478
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,465
to do battle against all evildoers.

479
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,302
But never in any wrong cause,
nor do any outrage.

480
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,182
I will defend the helpless
and protect all women...

481
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,475
and be merciful to all men.

482
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:36,353
I will honor my word...

483
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,899
and I will speak no treason nor slander.

484
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,694
I will be true in friendship...

485
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,905
and faithful in love.

486
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,825
All this I do swear on the hilt of my sword.

487
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,786
Do all here swear it likewise?

488
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,169
So be it.

489
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,880
God grant long life to the table round!

490
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:13,390
<i>So England was blessed with peace...</i>

491
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:17,228
<i>for while Arthur and Lancelot</i>
were united in friendship...

492
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:20,231
<i>no force of evil</i>
was strong enough to prevail...

493
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,609
<i>against the chivalry of the Round Table.</i>

494
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:31,408
Zounds! Does my hair look like an apple?

495
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:35,704
'Twas that loon with his harp.
He did it on purpose to spoil my aim.

496
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:38,249
Your aim's as poor as his music.

497
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:42,711
Put up your bow, Gawaine.

498
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,631
We can grow new apples quicker
than we can grow new ears.

499
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,843
My new hawk against yours,
I'll split that apple before you do.

500
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:51,220
Taken. By your leave, my lady.

501
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:59,228
Stop daydreaming.
You're at court now, not in a meadow.

502
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,946
Milady...

503
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,325
this is my sister, Elaine.

504
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,037
- You're welcome here.
- Thank you, my lady.

505
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:20,499
Milady, I beg you to make her
a lady-in-waiting.

506
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:23,085
She refuses to stay at home anymore.

507
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:25,129
Is that what you would like?

508
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,380
Music!

509
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,020
You owe me a hawk, sir knight.

510
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:50,070
- Sir Lancelot of the Lake, my sister.
- My lady.

511
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:53,032
Have you found the happy islands yet?

512
00:49:53,157 --> 00:49:55,075
Happy islands, my lady?

513
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:58,662
Have you forgotten them
as easily as you've forgotten me?

514
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:00,247
Forgotten you?

515
00:50:05,085 --> 00:50:08,797
A thousand pardons, my lady,
but how grown-up you are.

516
00:50:08,881 --> 00:50:12,051
- Do you think so, too?
- Everyone does except you.

517
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,721
Are you still making midsummer wishes?

518
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,682
No. That was the only one
I shall ever make.

519
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:23,187
- Is your horse well?
- Berrick? Yes.

520
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:26,315
He will remember you.
He'll be delighted to see you again.

521
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:27,983
When may I see him?

522
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:30,110
Do you presume
a knight of the Round Table...

523
00:50:30,194 --> 00:50:32,822
has nothing better to do
than to show you his horse?

524
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:34,824
When may I see Berrick?

525
00:50:34,907 --> 00:50:36,784
He was part of my wish.

526
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:39,495
You shall see him tomorrow, my lady.

527
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:56,470
Where have you seen that child before?

528
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,806
In a wood, one midsummer's eve.

529
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:03,769
She made a wish in a pool for a knight
to come riding by and carry her off.

530
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:08,190
And did a knight come riding by
and carry her off?

531
00:51:08,274 --> 00:51:10,151
Not while I was there.

532
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,744
Am I deceived,
or do I scent a pair of royal turtledoves?

533
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,082
What is that?

534
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:28,544
- An old coin.
- It's beautiful.

535
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:32,590
It's yours.

536
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:35,217
Thank you.

537
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,928
You are not deceived.

538
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:41,682
We must set a trap
to catch our turtledoves.

539
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:30,147
My lady, that is a new necklace
you are wearing this evening.

540
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:32,483
- May I admire it?
- If you wish.

541
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:35,486
An old coin. How curious and charming.

542
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:40,449
Only one who loves most deeply
gives such an unusual token to his lady.

543
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,451
I had not noticed it.

544
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,620
Fie, my lord, to give such a gift...

545
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:47,039
then not notice it
when it is worn in your honor?

546
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:50,042
It was given to me by Lancelot,
not the King.

547
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,877
By Lancelot?

548
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:55,089
I wish I could charm you
into such a gift, sire.

549
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,341
What must I do to deserve it?

550
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,678
If I please you with my dancing,
will that be a beginning?

551
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:03,180
I'm already in your debt, my lady.

552
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:06,016
May I be likewise honored, my lady?

553
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:11,480
Alas, my lady, you have come off worst.
But never mind.

554
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:14,817
Lancelot shall dance with you
for the rest of the evening.

555
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,652
I shall command it.

556
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,424
Well, sire, now we're alone,
what is this great secret?

557
00:53:38,507 --> 00:53:40,050
A pleasant one, I hope.

558
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:44,221
Not pleasant and no longer,
unfortunately, a secret.

559
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:47,391
A delicate matter and yet I must be blunt.

560
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:53,522
A court is a very elegant place, my lady...

561
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:56,442
and doubly so when you are queen of it.

562
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:59,320
But its walls not only have ears...

563
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,906
they have eyes, and they have lips.

564
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,658
No one is safe from them, my lady...

565
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:07,620
not even the King himself,
and not even you.

566
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:10,289
Are you trying to tell me
that I have enemies?

567
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:12,708
Everyone in a court has enemies.

568
00:54:12,917 --> 00:54:16,045
If the Queen's could make a lie
of her that men believed...

569
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:19,632
it would break the Round Table
and destroy the kingdom.

570
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,593
What lie could they make of me?

571
00:54:22,635 --> 00:54:24,970
One that would involve Lancelot.

572
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:28,557
Lancelot is my husband's friend.

573
00:54:28,641 --> 00:54:31,143
And Modred is your husband's enemy.

574
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,816
- Does my husband know of this?
- Not from my lips.

575
00:54:36,899 --> 00:54:38,567
- Then I shall tell him.
- No.

576
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:39,902
Why not?

577
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:43,113
If Arthur believed you
and banished Modred...

578
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:47,243
I should no longer be able to keep
an eye on him, which I do very well here.

579
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:48,786
If he disbelieved you...

580
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:52,665
you would have done yourself grave harm
in his trusting eyes.

581
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,669
And what of Lancelot in all of this?

582
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:59,713
It is Lancelot for whom I am concerned.

583
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:03,425
He is the torch with which Modred
would light up England.

584
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:06,679
- It is horrible.
- It is life.

585
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:09,974
And Lancelot is too vulnerable...

586
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:14,603
to be out of reach of this mischief.
He should be safely married.

587
00:55:15,146 --> 00:55:16,397
Married?

588
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:20,776
I'm glad it is I who sit watching your face
at this moment...

589
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:23,154
and not Morgan Le Fay, my lady.

590
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:26,198
- Do you suspect me, too?
- No, my lady.

591
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:31,537
But I am just as artful as she
at weaving guilt out of innocence...

592
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,039
if it be for the good of my cause.

593
00:55:36,167 --> 00:55:38,127
Lancelot should marry.

594
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:42,506
It is not too cruel a sacrifice
for the throne he serves.

595
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:02,568
Why so silent, child?

596
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:06,447
I'm trying to find the courage
to ask you a question, my lady.

597
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:09,700
<i>- Why is it so difficult?</i>
- Because...

598
00:56:11,327 --> 00:56:13,329
Is it about Sir Lancelot?

599
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:17,666
- How did you know, my lady?
- I guessed. Now ask me your question.

600
00:56:18,751 --> 00:56:20,961
Does he love anyone, my lady?

601
00:56:22,171 --> 00:56:24,173
He has never told me so.

602
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,510
- Then there isn't anyone else?
- No, no one.

603
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:31,972
Does he ever notice me
or speak about me?

604
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:33,933
I'm sure he does.

605
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:39,063
My lady, would he marry someone
who loved him as much as I did...

606
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:41,857
even if he didn't love them very much?

607
00:56:41,982 --> 00:56:44,693
Even if he only loved them very little?

608
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:49,240
Would any woman be wise to marry a man
who did not love her, my child?

609
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:51,367
It could bring heartbreak with it.

610
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:55,538
My heart would only break
if I thought I might never see him again.

611
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:58,666
Then you would marry him
no matter what the cost?

612
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:00,209
Yes, my lady.

613
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:02,711
Yes, I would.

614
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:09,176
Gawaine, you station yourself downwind.
I'll wait above the river.

615
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,187
Elaine was speaking of you
as we rode here.

616
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:22,231
She does me great honor.

617
00:57:22,857 --> 00:57:26,569
- I've come to know her very well.
- I trust she pleases you.

618
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,949
- Does she please you?
- Yes, why not?

619
00:57:32,575 --> 00:57:34,785
How much does she please you?

620
00:57:35,161 --> 00:57:38,789
Saving yourself,
I would be her servant before all others.

621
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:01,145
Lessen, Sheba! Lessen!

622
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,219
Drop, Sheba!

623
00:59:01,497 --> 00:59:04,458
Lancelot, there is something
I must tell you.

624
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:07,670
I know that you love me.

625
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:11,048
You would never tell me so,
but I know that you do.

626
00:59:12,174 --> 00:59:14,802
While it was our secret,
no harm or shame could come of it.

627
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,012
But it's no longer a secret.

628
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:20,140
And we have enemies.

629
00:59:21,517 --> 00:59:23,894
Those enemies would be silenced...

630
00:59:24,645 --> 00:59:26,313
if you wed Elaine.

631
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:31,735
It is my wish that you do so,
for she loves you, too.

632
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:38,701
All through the war,
Arthur would speak of you.

633
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:43,205
I fought beside him shoulder to shoulder,
and you were ever in his heart.

634
00:59:43,289 --> 00:59:45,541
You must not be in mine, too.

635
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,544
I will do as you bid me.

636
00:59:49,461 --> 00:59:50,838
Thank you.

637
01:00:04,268 --> 01:00:05,686
Come, Sheba.

638
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:24,747
- Well flown.
- Yes, she stooped well.

639
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,710
Sire, if it please you, I will go to the north
as captain of the marches.

640
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:31,504
You, Lancelot? Why?

641
01:00:31,587 --> 01:00:34,465
- There's good fighting in the north.
- There always is.

642
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:38,093
- The Picts are in revolt.
- The Picts are always in revolt.

643
01:00:38,511 --> 01:00:41,180
Sire, you know me better
than any man living.

644
01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:45,518
My sword arm has been idle too long.
I'm sick for the sound of battle.

645
01:00:46,227 --> 01:00:47,937
I understand that.

646
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,272
You have my leave to go.

647
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:53,609
I would also ask a favor of the Lady Elaine.

648
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:57,988
Will you go with me, my lady, as my wife?

649
01:01:00,491 --> 01:01:01,951
Yes, my lord.

650
01:01:02,618 --> 01:01:03,869
Happily.

651
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:08,457
- My lady.
- My child.

652
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:11,502
Our blessings go with you both.

653
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:26,392
My lady and a favor of my wife...

654
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:30,771
I will remain your champion and carry
your scarf as I have always done...

655
01:01:30,855 --> 01:01:32,815
in loyalty and in honor.

656
01:01:42,324 --> 01:01:43,909
God go with you.

657
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:00,718
How we shall miss him.

658
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:04,054
I am missing him already.

659
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:14,565
Advance the banner!

660
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:18,319
Lower lances!

661
01:02:19,487 --> 01:02:21,614
Raise lances!

662
01:02:27,328 --> 01:02:29,455
Forward! On!

663
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:59,902
Which of us grieves most, I wonder,
to see them depart?

664
01:03:01,779 --> 01:03:04,532
Whichever of us has the tenderest heart.

665
01:03:05,533 --> 01:03:08,452
Good. Then neither of us is grieving.

666
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:35,146
Is there any sign of them?

667
01:03:35,187 --> 01:03:37,189
A messenger, a horseman?

668
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:39,483
I feel my husband is near at hand.

669
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:41,902
I wish I had your faith, milady.

670
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:44,697
Then do not falter in your own, Gawaine.

671
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:48,075
I tell myself three months
is but a quarter of a year.

672
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:51,579
But already I feel
they've been gone three centuries.

673
01:03:51,996 --> 01:03:54,039
They will come home safe.

674
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,625
I can feel him very close to me.

675
01:03:56,667 --> 01:04:00,838
I'd be even closer to him
if he'd taken me instead of that harper.

676
01:04:00,963 --> 01:04:04,216
Would you sooner
Gareth had watched over my safety?

677
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:06,177
No, milady.

678
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:10,639
He has no more sense of responsibility
than his own silly harp.

679
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:15,978
Milady.

680
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:35,331
Never a sign of a bow.
Will we ever see a Pict?

681
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:39,335
- Aye, they burrow earth like badgers.
- Or dissolved into highland mist.

682
01:04:39,418 --> 01:04:41,670
Ready to smother us to death.

683
01:04:43,714 --> 01:04:44,924
Silence!

684
01:04:53,224 --> 01:04:54,642
Form ranks!

685
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:16,789
Form ranks!

686
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,299
Flame your arrows!

687
01:06:13,512 --> 01:06:14,763
Shields!

688
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:23,856
Hold firm, you old blusterer.

689
01:06:24,398 --> 01:06:27,109
Milord, I've blustered my last bluster.

690
01:06:28,736 --> 01:06:31,363
Was I such an uncouth knight after all?

691
01:06:31,447 --> 01:06:34,325
You were as goodly a knight
as I have known.

692
01:06:47,046 --> 01:06:49,298
Forward! On!

693
01:07:40,141 --> 01:07:41,767
My lady, gently.

694
01:07:42,184 --> 01:07:43,978
Nan, help me quickly.

695
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:47,606
All these months away. Now he is here,
and I'm not ready to greet him.

696
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:50,860
- You were told not to fluster yourself.
- I'm not flustering myself.

697
01:07:50,943 --> 01:07:53,612
Truly I am well now he is here.

698
01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:07,001
My lady.

699
01:08:07,585 --> 01:08:08,878
My lord.

700
01:08:14,216 --> 01:08:19,722
<i>A lady wise as ivory bone</i>

701
01:08:19,930 --> 01:08:24,685
<i>A pearl in gold that golden shone</i>

702
01:08:24,977 --> 01:08:29,398
<i>A lady fair</i>

703
01:08:29,607 --> 01:08:34,653
<i>A love where on my heart may cling</i>

704
01:08:35,446 --> 01:08:40,367
<i>Her blitheness nevermore be gone</i>

705
01:08:40,451 --> 01:08:43,204
<i>while I sing</i>

706
01:08:43,704 --> 01:08:46,624
The Scottish mist has rusted all his notes.

707
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:53,547
<i>I will her well, she wills me woe</i>

708
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:59,011
<i>Methinks my heart will break in two</i>

709
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:05,267
<i>For sorrow's mine</i>

710
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:12,733
<i>In God's own greeting may she go</i>

711
01:09:13,901 --> 01:09:17,321
<i>That lady mine</i>

712
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:24,161
A lovely song, Gareth.
But why such a sad one?

713
01:09:24,703 --> 01:09:26,789
Aye, strike up a gay tune.

714
01:09:27,122 --> 01:09:29,083
Will you dance, my lady?

715
01:09:43,764 --> 01:09:45,391
Percival's here!

716
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:50,146
Never was a face more welcome!

717
01:09:50,187 --> 01:09:52,690
Never was a heart more cold and weary.

718
01:09:52,773 --> 01:09:54,191
Come, sit by the fire.

719
01:09:54,275 --> 01:09:56,485
- Bring meat and wine.
- Yes, sire.

720
01:09:56,527 --> 01:09:59,864
- What news of the court?
- You will know more than I.

721
01:09:59,905 --> 01:10:02,324
We? We've heard nothing
since we left there.

722
01:10:02,366 --> 01:10:04,493
How long have you been gone
from Camelot?

723
01:10:04,535 --> 01:10:06,120
Too many weeks.

724
01:10:06,954 --> 01:10:09,290
Percival, is all well with you?

725
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:12,376
I am upon a quest, sire.

726
01:10:12,793 --> 01:10:15,254
- What do you seek?
- The Holy Grail.

727
01:10:17,298 --> 01:10:21,844
At Pentecost, when the Round Table met,
every knight save you sat in his own place.

728
01:10:21,927 --> 01:10:25,181
Then suddenly we heard
the crash and cry of thunder...

729
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:29,351
louder until we thought the walls
must tumble inwards and destroy us.

730
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:33,731
And then the tumult died,
and the hall was filled with light...

731
01:10:34,565 --> 01:10:37,401
a hundred times more clear than day.

732
01:10:38,444 --> 01:10:40,529
And no knight could speak.

733
01:10:41,113 --> 01:10:45,367
Then we heard music,
as if the skies were filled with joyful song.

734
01:10:46,785 --> 01:10:49,371
- Then a voice spoke.
- A voice?

735
01:10:49,497 --> 01:10:51,540
<i>But the strangest thing...</i>

736
01:10:51,999 --> 01:10:55,211
And this is something
I do not even now understand.

737
01:10:55,294 --> 01:10:56,420
What?

738
01:10:57,379 --> 01:11:00,549
Every knight heard the music
and saw the light...

739
01:11:00,925 --> 01:11:03,427
but I was the only one
who heard the voice.

740
01:11:03,511 --> 01:11:05,137
What did it say?

741
01:11:05,554 --> 01:11:08,349
It said, "Percival, my knight...

742
01:11:09,475 --> 01:11:13,062
"who has come out of worldly life
into spiritual life...

743
01:11:13,938 --> 01:11:16,732
"go forth. Seek the Holy Grail...

744
01:11:17,525 --> 01:11:21,362
"blessed for in that our Lord drank from it
at the last, sad supper.

745
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:27,493
"And when he died upon the cross
for all mankind, it held his precious blood.

746
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:29,411
"Seek it...

747
01:11:29,453 --> 01:11:32,873
"till the end of the faith
in what is eternal may be renewed.

748
01:11:33,916 --> 01:11:37,127
"For in good time,
the cup will return to Earth...

749
01:11:37,878 --> 01:11:41,674
"and there remain, that men may be
at peace with one another.

750
01:11:42,925 --> 01:11:47,429
"Blessed be God who lives and moves
in all things eternally. "

751
01:11:48,222 --> 01:11:49,348
Amen.

752
01:11:51,267 --> 01:11:54,645
The King granted me leave
to go forth upon my quest...

753
01:11:54,687 --> 01:11:56,939
but in his heart
it saddened him to see me go.

754
01:11:57,022 --> 01:11:59,567
"First Lancelot, now you," he said.

755
01:12:00,818 --> 01:12:02,486
He's a lonely man.

756
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:07,408
You are twice welcome,
my brother Percival.

757
01:12:07,491 --> 01:12:10,452
Your coming
has brought great joy to us both.

758
01:12:10,828 --> 01:12:15,291
My lady, will you see to his comfort?
I must make my round of the guard.

759
01:12:18,169 --> 01:12:21,380
All the happiness in my world
is here with me now.

760
01:12:21,672 --> 01:12:24,300
And mine is all renewed.

761
01:13:06,842 --> 01:13:09,804
- What is it?
- Nothing, my liege.

762
01:13:11,305 --> 01:13:13,224
Is loneliness nothing?

763
01:13:13,766 --> 01:13:15,351
I'm not lonely.

764
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:18,687
I am...

765
01:13:19,605 --> 01:13:21,524
and I think you are, also.

766
01:13:23,275 --> 01:13:26,862
Great tasks bring great demands
upon the human spirit...

767
01:13:27,196 --> 01:13:29,448
and sometimes great weariness.

768
01:13:29,907 --> 01:13:33,869
I often must watch you walk,
when none may follow or comfort you...

769
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:36,539
I least of all.

770
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:40,584
You most of all.

771
01:13:42,169 --> 01:13:44,421
My lord, I honor you above all men.

772
01:13:44,505 --> 01:13:48,676
I watch with wonder how you bring
justice and mercy to your people.

773
01:13:49,134 --> 01:13:51,470
And I long to serve you better.

774
01:13:52,429 --> 01:13:56,559
With far more love and understanding
than I possess.

775
01:13:57,977 --> 01:14:01,981
But a king such as you
stands in need of a greater queen than I.

776
01:14:19,373 --> 01:14:21,500
I love him also, Guinevere.

777
01:14:38,058 --> 01:14:40,978
I did not know
my sister could be so happy.

778
01:14:41,937 --> 01:14:45,399
Whoever has put his trust in you,
you have made happy.

779
01:14:45,983 --> 01:14:47,985
Who knows better than I?

780
01:14:48,777 --> 01:14:53,657
What I do not know, is why I came
to be chosen for the holy quest...

781
01:14:54,116 --> 01:14:57,036
instead of the truest knight
in Christendom.

782
01:14:58,579 --> 01:15:02,041
Every worldly conquest I ever sought,
I have achieved.

783
01:15:02,333 --> 01:15:06,212
And never have I been beaten in a quarrel,
were it right or wrong.

784
01:15:06,295 --> 01:15:08,130
But in holy things, I must fail...

785
01:15:08,172 --> 01:15:11,175
for there's a sin in my heart
which blights me.

786
01:15:11,258 --> 01:15:14,094
And no power will ever make it pure again.

787
01:15:14,178 --> 01:15:18,974
If there's a weight of sorrow in your heart,
let mine bear half the weight.

788
01:15:19,225 --> 01:15:22,228
But I know there is no sin in your heart...

789
01:15:22,436 --> 01:15:24,980
or my own would look black and lost.

790
01:15:26,690 --> 01:15:29,026
There's no sin in you, Percival.

791
01:15:29,401 --> 01:15:31,779
And you will find what you seek.

792
01:15:32,488 --> 01:15:35,074
The voice who spoke to you was God's.

793
01:15:38,911 --> 01:15:41,372
My lord, Lancelot.

794
01:15:42,581 --> 01:15:44,208
Come, sit by me.

795
01:15:45,543 --> 01:15:48,212
I will tell you the dream I dreamed...

796
01:15:49,296 --> 01:15:50,840
about our son.

797
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:56,470
- You're certain it's to be a son, are you?
- I saw him.

798
01:15:57,721 --> 01:15:59,765
He was armed all in white.

799
01:16:00,391 --> 01:16:02,726
His shield and spear were white.

800
01:16:03,018 --> 01:16:04,645
So was his horse.

801
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:09,191
He had your eyes, your smile,
and your bearing...

802
01:16:10,151 --> 01:16:13,070
and yet he was like no one, save himself.

803
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:17,241
There was a great light about him.

804
01:16:17,741 --> 01:16:19,702
I envy you such a dream.

805
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:24,206
You know, do you not,
that my dream will come true?

806
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:27,668
They always have.

807
01:16:29,879 --> 01:16:32,882
- Yours haven't.
- Why did you say that?

808
01:16:34,049 --> 01:16:36,552
You never found your happy islands.

809
01:16:38,387 --> 01:16:42,683
Strange that you should remember
that idle jest of mine above all others.

810
01:16:42,766 --> 01:16:44,560
It was no idle jest.

811
01:16:46,979 --> 01:16:49,106
These are my happy islands.

812
01:16:50,149 --> 01:16:52,818
I never want more than this from life.

813
01:16:53,777 --> 01:16:56,655
Have you indeed
been made so happy by so little?

814
01:16:56,739 --> 01:16:58,115
So little?

815
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:02,077
If I had all my life to live again...

816
01:17:02,953 --> 01:17:05,289
I would have nothing different.

817
01:17:06,415 --> 01:17:08,584
Do you understand, Lancelot?

818
01:17:09,543 --> 01:17:11,253
Nothing different.

819
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:15,174
I want you to remember that always.

820
01:17:17,009 --> 01:17:18,260
I will.

821
01:17:23,974 --> 01:17:26,560
- Is Modred here?
- With King Mar.

822
01:17:33,901 --> 01:17:36,237
What does Modred so far knoweth?

823
01:17:36,487 --> 01:17:38,614
Why have we been summoned here?

824
01:17:38,656 --> 01:17:41,033
Why did you come,
unless you guessed my purpose?

825
01:17:41,116 --> 01:17:44,286
I'll not join in plots against Arthur
till the country's divided.

826
01:17:44,328 --> 01:17:45,454
Nor I.

827
01:17:45,913 --> 01:17:49,416
What will divide it quicker
than a clash between Lancelot and Arthur?

828
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:53,128
- His head is full of wild nonsense.
- Not wild or nonsense.

829
01:17:53,754 --> 01:17:56,632
There is a fraying link in Arthur's chain.

830
01:17:56,966 --> 01:18:01,053
Lancelot is the Queen's lover.
Why else do you think I'm here, my lords?

831
01:18:01,137 --> 01:18:04,473
If Mar will but sue for peace,
I will do the rest.

832
01:18:05,057 --> 01:18:08,185
- I sue Lancelot for peace?
- Once the war here is at an end...

833
01:18:08,269 --> 01:18:11,730
what is to keep Lancelot
from returning to the court at Camelot?

834
01:18:12,523 --> 01:18:16,777
Once at Camelot, Lancelot and the Queen
will betray themselves.

835
01:18:17,862 --> 01:18:19,280
I put my oath upon it.

836
01:18:19,363 --> 01:18:21,991
I crawl to Lancelot for peace terms?

837
01:18:22,283 --> 01:18:25,202
- It's madness.
- Wait, let me hear Modred out.

838
01:18:25,452 --> 01:18:27,580
I smell method in his mind.

839
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:32,168
Read it.

840
01:18:38,549 --> 01:18:41,093
"Sire, I give thee loyal greetings.

841
01:18:42,136 --> 01:18:44,972
"The border is now under such good rule
as you would have.

842
01:18:45,055 --> 01:18:48,684
"The Picts, under their leader Mar,
having sued for peace.

843
01:18:49,435 --> 01:18:53,022
"With Gareth and Gawaine
I send my son Galahad...

844
01:18:54,565 --> 01:18:56,901
"for whom, in giving him life...

845
01:18:57,985 --> 01:19:00,029
"my lady, his mother, died.

846
01:19:00,905 --> 01:19:04,617
"Than hers, no heart was ever
more constant, more gentle...

847
01:19:05,576 --> 01:19:07,369
"and more forgiving.

848
01:19:08,579 --> 01:19:12,041
"I pray you, take means
to send my son to my father...

849
01:19:12,583 --> 01:19:15,336
"that he may have joy in his grandchild.

850
01:19:15,503 --> 01:19:17,713
"Be certain of our friendship.

851
01:19:17,796 --> 01:19:22,426
"And Her Grace, the Queen,
may know that I am her true servant still.

852
01:19:24,887 --> 01:19:26,180
"Lancelot.

853
01:19:27,848 --> 01:19:29,058
"Knight. "

854
01:19:33,437 --> 01:19:36,982
- When should you return to the north?
- As soon as it please you, sire.

855
01:19:37,066 --> 01:19:40,778
I will give you letters to Lancelot,
and then you shall go.

856
01:19:43,572 --> 01:19:47,743
Sire, Lancelot must come back.
He has been too long away.

857
01:19:48,702 --> 01:19:49,995
You are right.

858
01:19:50,079 --> 01:19:54,333
- Sire, it is too soon to send for Lancelot.
- Too soon, when the war is over?

859
01:19:54,416 --> 01:19:57,795
Mar will be up in arms again
as soon as his back is turned.

860
01:19:57,878 --> 01:20:01,131
Lancelot still serves England best
from the marches...

861
01:20:01,215 --> 01:20:03,634
and would not come, save by command.

862
01:20:03,676 --> 01:20:05,761
Therefore, command him not.

863
01:20:08,681 --> 01:20:10,641
Let us see to the child, my lady.

864
01:20:10,683 --> 01:20:15,146
I'll speak with Merlin later on this matter,
when his tongue is not so sharp.

865
01:20:23,988 --> 01:20:26,490
"When his tongue is not so sharp. "

866
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:31,162
I would that I had the old raven's throat
between my fingers now.

867
01:20:31,662 --> 01:20:33,539
Fingers leave bruises.

868
01:20:33,914 --> 01:20:35,457
Merlin is old.

869
01:20:35,958 --> 01:20:38,794
His death could easily look more natural.

870
01:20:41,505 --> 01:20:42,882
Make it so.

871
01:21:23,380 --> 01:21:26,008
Merlin, I sent for you some hours ago.

872
01:21:27,134 --> 01:21:29,261
Why did you not come to me?

873
01:21:30,137 --> 01:21:32,556
Let us not quarrel over Lancelot.

874
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:36,727
If your real reasons be sound,
I pledge to leave him in the north.

875
01:21:37,478 --> 01:21:40,940
But if they be the whims of an old tyrant,
I shall recall him...

876
01:21:41,023 --> 01:21:42,942
and risk your scolding.

877
01:21:44,068 --> 01:21:45,653
What do you say?

878
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:37,371
Lower lances!

879
01:22:40,457 --> 01:22:42,960
Raise lances!

880
01:22:48,257 --> 01:22:50,050
Knights and ladies...

881
01:22:50,134 --> 01:22:53,053
for as much as Sir Lancelot of the Lake...

882
01:22:53,137 --> 01:22:58,017
has kept the King's Guard on
the northern marches well and faithfully...

883
01:22:58,309 --> 01:23:01,687
and is now returned to court
at the King's desire...

884
01:23:02,146 --> 01:23:05,316
I do proclaim, in the King's name...

885
01:23:05,399 --> 01:23:07,359
12 days of holiday...

886
01:23:07,443 --> 01:23:12,448
with such tournaments, feasting,
dancing and merrymaking...

887
01:23:12,615 --> 01:23:15,367
as shall be devised hereafter.

888
01:23:37,181 --> 01:23:38,808
A plague take the tournament.

889
01:23:38,849 --> 01:23:42,061
Why must I run with every knight
who wants to shout for his lady?

890
01:23:42,144 --> 01:23:44,647
So that every lady will shout for you.

891
01:23:45,314 --> 01:23:47,691
The dunce will think
they shout for his ballads.

892
01:23:47,775 --> 01:23:49,944
Then he'll sing them, one upon another...

893
01:23:50,027 --> 01:23:52,696
till they shout even louder for mercy.

894
01:23:53,864 --> 01:23:56,408
What's that, milord? A lady's favor?

895
01:23:56,867 --> 01:23:58,118
Why not?

896
01:23:58,285 --> 01:24:00,830
Is it in memory of the Lady Elaine?

897
01:24:01,789 --> 01:24:04,166
I need no scarf to remember her.

898
01:24:06,877 --> 01:24:08,254
By my soul!

899
01:24:08,587 --> 01:24:11,590
Lancelot is wearing
a lady's favor on his arm.

900
01:24:11,841 --> 01:24:15,261
A favor? But is he not still in mourning
for his wife?

901
01:24:15,636 --> 01:24:18,889
I thank God
some lady has called his thoughts back.

902
01:25:58,197 --> 01:26:00,366
Sires, ladies...

903
01:26:02,034 --> 01:26:04,954
what is the most difficult art in the world?

904
01:26:04,995 --> 01:26:06,914
It is to shave an egg.

905
01:26:07,331 --> 01:26:10,459
But Cohl the dancer
will shave a dozen eggs with his toes...

906
01:26:10,501 --> 01:26:12,211
without breaking one.

907
01:26:13,087 --> 01:26:17,383
If you doubt me, lay your wagers
on the number he will break.

908
01:26:17,842 --> 01:26:19,635
- Two.
- Four.

909
01:26:19,718 --> 01:26:20,719
Seven.

910
01:26:21,387 --> 01:26:23,973
- I wager he breaks none.
- Impossible.

911
01:26:24,014 --> 01:26:26,892
- What will you wager?
- A kiss.

912
01:26:28,394 --> 01:26:32,481
- Is that the Queen's new rival?
- I wonder.

913
01:26:34,316 --> 01:26:35,526
Agreed.

914
01:27:06,390 --> 01:27:07,933
So far so good.

915
01:27:30,372 --> 01:27:31,957
Take your wager!

916
01:27:47,765 --> 01:27:50,142
The Lady Vivien had best take care.

917
01:27:50,226 --> 01:27:53,771
We are all a little jealous of her,
are we not, my lady?

918
01:28:02,905 --> 01:28:04,198
Leave me.

919
01:28:05,574 --> 01:28:09,036
- But, madam, who will tend to you?
- I will tend myself.

920
01:29:03,591 --> 01:29:06,677
You were right, my lady.
The Queen has gone to Lancelot.

921
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:10,556
Your men are waiting and ready.
Fetch them to the east tower.

922
01:29:10,764 --> 01:29:11,765
Go.

923
01:29:13,684 --> 01:29:16,770
This time we shall not fail.
The King shall have proof absolute.

924
01:29:16,854 --> 01:29:21,233
You mustn't be there when they're taken.
Arthur must think we are innocent.

925
01:29:21,817 --> 01:29:25,112
Wait here. Maybe we will not fail.

926
01:29:36,665 --> 01:29:38,042
Who is it?

927
01:29:50,054 --> 01:29:52,097
- My lady.
- Close the door.

928
01:29:58,145 --> 01:30:00,064
What brought you here?

929
01:30:00,356 --> 01:30:03,192
I must know what I've done
that you should hurt me.

930
01:30:03,234 --> 01:30:06,070
You come here at this hour
to ask me that?

931
01:30:06,237 --> 01:30:07,780
When else could I ask you?

932
01:30:07,863 --> 01:30:10,533
In the presence of the court
so that you could shame me?

933
01:30:10,616 --> 01:30:13,869
But it's high treason for you to come.
You dishonor us both.

934
01:30:13,911 --> 01:30:17,373
You cannot stay, nor come here again,
nor speak to me beyond my duty.

935
01:30:17,414 --> 01:30:21,001
Is it a part of your duty
to humiliate me for all to see?

936
01:30:21,794 --> 01:30:24,839
This is all in your mind.
I beg of you, return to your chamber.

937
01:30:24,922 --> 01:30:28,217
Speak with me tomorrow
where no harm can come of it.

938
01:30:28,759 --> 01:30:30,970
Why did you ignore me tonight?

939
01:30:31,470 --> 01:30:34,223
Has your love for me turned to contempt?

940
01:30:35,266 --> 01:30:37,852
Why? I must know why.

941
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:42,898
My lady, in only one thing
have you mistaken me.

942
01:30:43,274 --> 01:30:44,942
I do not love you.

943
01:30:46,193 --> 01:30:48,904
It is not in my nature to love or honor.

944
01:30:49,155 --> 01:30:52,741
It's only my nature to fight,
sport, eat, and fight again.

945
01:30:54,368 --> 01:30:56,036
Was it all a lie?

946
01:30:56,787 --> 01:30:58,664
Did you never love me?

947
01:30:58,914 --> 01:31:02,293
If I did, nothing lasts forever.
Least of all folly.

948
01:31:03,669 --> 01:31:05,254
What are you saying?

949
01:31:05,296 --> 01:31:08,591
Did you yourself not warn me
that Modred watches our every move?

950
01:31:08,632 --> 01:31:10,968
Is he such a fool
not to be watching us now...

951
01:31:11,051 --> 01:31:14,263
hoping it is you
and not the Lady Vivien I favor?

952
01:31:14,346 --> 01:31:17,600
As for the Lady Vivien,
she and I are of a feather.

953
01:31:18,017 --> 01:31:19,977
The demands on one another are light.

954
01:31:20,019 --> 01:31:22,605
- We do not commit high treason.
- Stop.

955
01:31:23,522 --> 01:31:25,441
I beg you, say no more.

956
01:31:29,570 --> 01:31:32,490
I will not degrade myself before you again.

957
01:31:39,288 --> 01:31:40,664
Who is it?

958
01:31:41,999 --> 01:31:43,167
Death.

959
01:31:45,002 --> 01:31:47,254
They're waiting on the stairs.

960
01:31:54,011 --> 01:31:56,764
Then it was I who had too little faith.

961
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:13,656
It's too late for silence, Lancelot.
You're trapped at last.

962
01:32:13,948 --> 01:32:17,743
Modred's men. He and Morgan
have been waiting only for this moment.

963
01:32:17,868 --> 01:32:19,328
Traitor knight!

964
01:32:19,370 --> 01:32:22,248
We'll have your head on a pole,
and your trollop, too.

965
01:32:22,331 --> 01:32:25,709
She'll go to the stake
in a fancy sackcloth smock.

966
01:32:25,751 --> 01:32:28,337
Come out, or we'll batter down the door!

967
01:32:28,796 --> 01:32:30,714
- What is it?
- My sword.

968
01:32:30,798 --> 01:32:33,551
Simon took my sword
to mend the scabbard.

969
01:32:35,886 --> 01:32:38,639
- We're lost.
- If we're lost, all is lost.

970
01:32:38,722 --> 01:32:40,599
King, kingdom, England.

971
01:32:41,892 --> 01:32:45,062
Agravaine, if you withdraw
and quit this place...

972
01:32:45,146 --> 01:32:47,898
I swear on valid knighthood
I will answer to the King.

973
01:32:47,982 --> 01:32:50,401
You shall to the King,
and his queen with you...

974
01:32:50,442 --> 01:32:51,944
in Modred's presence.

975
01:32:52,027 --> 01:32:56,198
Agravaine, I will give myself up
and stand trial if you will spare Lancelot.

976
01:32:59,076 --> 01:33:01,036
Give ground. I'll unbar.

977
01:33:03,914 --> 01:33:05,166
I had...

978
01:34:41,804 --> 01:34:45,057
All that has befallen
shall be accounted for to Arthur...

979
01:34:45,141 --> 01:34:46,767
but never by you.

980
01:35:17,798 --> 01:35:21,760
Sires, you've heard proof spoken
under oath and without malice...

981
01:35:21,844 --> 01:35:25,097
that the Queen's grace did secretly,
and at night...

982
01:35:25,181 --> 01:35:27,850
and without the knowledge
of her husband...

983
01:35:27,892 --> 01:35:30,936
go unattended
to the quarters of Sir Lancelot.

984
01:35:31,729 --> 01:35:36,066
You shall give your voice, each one of you,
for or against the accused.

985
01:35:36,525 --> 01:35:41,238
You will bear in mind, if they be guilty,
the penalty by law for high treason.

986
01:35:41,572 --> 01:35:43,115
For the man...

987
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:47,912
that his head be smitten from his body,
and his body be dismembered...

988
01:35:48,078 --> 01:35:52,625
and his quarters hung up on the highway,
to the admonition of all traitors.

989
01:35:53,667 --> 01:35:55,252
For the woman...

990
01:35:56,086 --> 01:35:58,923
that she be conveyed
to the public square...

991
01:36:00,049 --> 01:36:02,968
there to be burned alive before the people.

992
01:36:08,724 --> 01:36:10,643
Sires, give your voice.

993
01:36:11,185 --> 01:36:13,354
Whether guilty or not guilty.

994
01:36:13,687 --> 01:36:15,523
- Sir Tor?
- Guilty.

995
01:36:15,898 --> 01:36:17,858
- Sir Lionel.
- Not guilty.

996
01:36:18,275 --> 01:36:19,652
- Sir Ector.
- Guilty.

997
01:36:33,249 --> 01:36:36,127
I heard a great lie
and rode here without rest.

998
01:36:36,210 --> 01:36:38,129
- Where is Lancelot?
- I know not.

999
01:36:38,170 --> 01:36:41,423
The King is here,
and the trial has all but ended.

1000
01:36:42,258 --> 01:36:43,425
Trial?

1001
01:36:49,181 --> 01:36:52,143
Therefore it is found,
by true count of voices...

1002
01:36:52,226 --> 01:36:55,396
that Lancelot of the Lake
and Guinevere Queen...

1003
01:36:55,479 --> 01:36:57,606
are each of them guilty of high treason...

1004
01:36:57,690 --> 01:37:00,317
against our sovereign lord, King Arthur.

1005
01:37:00,401 --> 01:37:01,819
My liege...

1006
01:37:01,986 --> 01:37:06,073
I ask authority for men at arms
sufficient to take the traitor Lancelot.

1007
01:37:33,642 --> 01:37:36,687
Most noble King,
I give myself into your hands.

1008
01:37:36,770 --> 01:37:40,691
If it is a plead for mercy,
your coming is ill-timed, Sir Lancelot.

1009
01:37:40,774 --> 01:37:45,404
Verdict of high treason has been brought
against you and the Queen's grace.

1010
01:37:45,571 --> 01:37:47,531
Why is the Queen not with you?

1011
01:37:47,573 --> 01:37:50,034
Because the Queen
has been so greatly wronged...

1012
01:37:50,075 --> 01:37:52,661
that I will hold her in safety
until it is righted.

1013
01:37:52,703 --> 01:37:53,954
Traitor!

1014
01:37:54,413 --> 01:37:58,000
Touching her loyalty and mine,
I will give full account.

1015
01:37:59,001 --> 01:38:03,380
But first I must speak of a friendship
from which all else has sprung.

1016
01:38:06,050 --> 01:38:10,638
In the old days, I rode in search of a man
and found him, became his friend.

1017
01:38:10,721 --> 01:38:14,183
We fought side by side
and endured all things together.

1018
01:38:15,726 --> 01:38:17,895
And if at times we differed and fell out...

1019
01:38:17,978 --> 01:38:21,649
still I will say that no two men living
were truer friends.

1020
01:38:23,734 --> 01:38:28,155
Then, again riding forth, I met a woman.
And from that hour I loved her.

1021
01:38:29,782 --> 01:38:32,535
Her name is Guinevere. She's your queen.

1022
01:38:33,744 --> 01:38:35,538
My friend was your king.

1023
01:38:35,579 --> 01:38:38,332
It pleased him to make me her champion.

1024
01:38:39,458 --> 01:38:42,211
Therefore I remained her servant
and no other's...

1025
01:38:42,253 --> 01:38:44,088
saving only the lady, my wife...

1026
01:38:44,171 --> 01:38:46,882
to whose soul may God give gentle rest.

1027
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:54,598
A man and a woman may love each other
all their lives with no evil between them.

1028
01:38:54,974 --> 01:38:56,559
Such love is good...

1029
01:38:56,600 --> 01:38:59,812
for by denial and suffering
the heart is purified.

1030
01:39:00,396 --> 01:39:01,814
Be that as it may...

1031
01:39:01,897 --> 01:39:05,109
if any knight will say
that the Queen is not a true wife...

1032
01:39:05,192 --> 01:39:07,653
I will make it good upon his body.

1033
01:39:08,946 --> 01:39:12,074
My liege, this man
is no longer free to offer battle.

1034
01:39:12,116 --> 01:39:14,160
He may only be condemned.

1035
01:39:15,411 --> 01:39:16,912
Sir Lancelot...

1036
01:39:17,538 --> 01:39:22,126
according to the law, the penalty for you
and Guinevere the Queen is death.

1037
01:39:24,962 --> 01:39:28,382
But by my authority
as sovereign lord of this realm...

1038
01:39:29,717 --> 01:39:32,261
neither the Queen nor you shall die.

1039
01:39:33,846 --> 01:39:35,890
Punishment there shall be.

1040
01:39:37,433 --> 01:39:39,935
Therefore I decree that Guinevere...

1041
01:39:40,811 --> 01:39:43,063
my queen that was...

1042
01:39:44,732 --> 01:39:47,776
be conveyed to the convent
of the holy nuns at Amesbury...

1043
01:39:47,818 --> 01:39:50,654
there to remain until the day of her death.

1044
01:39:53,824 --> 01:39:56,577
Sir Lancelot,
when this land was in need and peril...

1045
01:39:56,660 --> 01:40:01,248
you gave service in its cause that
ill deserves rewarding by a headman's ax.

1046
01:40:03,542 --> 01:40:07,338
Therefore you shall be banished
from this realm of England...

1047
01:40:07,630 --> 01:40:10,049
never in your lifetime to return.

1048
01:40:10,257 --> 01:40:11,842
The penalty is death!

1049
01:40:11,926 --> 01:40:14,053
The sentence is banishment!

1050
01:40:15,513 --> 01:40:19,391
Sire, I give you thanks
for your grace and mercy to the Queen.

1051
01:40:20,142 --> 01:40:21,811
I will abide this banishment...

1052
01:40:21,894 --> 01:40:25,022
though it be harsher
than the losing of my life.

1053
01:40:48,879 --> 01:40:52,466
My liege, it is you who have taught us
that no king of England...

1054
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:54,677
may set himself above the law.

1055
01:40:54,885 --> 01:40:58,139
Men and women, high and low,
are alike before the court of justice.

1056
01:40:58,222 --> 01:41:01,308
But you have twisted the law
to your private favor.

1057
01:41:01,392 --> 01:41:02,893
If you shield the living...

1058
01:41:02,977 --> 01:41:05,980
who shall avenge the dead
the outrage of murder?

1059
01:41:06,063 --> 01:41:09,233
You have broken the oath
taken in this very hall.

1060
01:41:12,528 --> 01:41:15,072
My lords, sires...

1061
01:41:17,741 --> 01:41:20,703
the last word in this matter
has been spoken.

1062
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:33,382
The last word in this matter
has not been spoken.

1063
01:41:33,466 --> 01:41:35,509
Do you challenge the King's authority?

1064
01:41:35,593 --> 01:41:38,220
King only so long as we call him king!

1065
01:41:39,263 --> 01:41:43,225
Is it kingly in a man to shrink from justice
when it cries its loudest?

1066
01:41:43,309 --> 01:41:45,269
Are there no knights who believe...

1067
01:41:45,311 --> 01:41:49,565
that the proud and strong should follow
none but he who is stronger still?

1068
01:41:50,566 --> 01:41:52,943
Is he a king or a man of straw...

1069
01:41:53,027 --> 01:41:56,489
blind to all, save his own grief,
and sick in the soul?

1070
01:41:56,947 --> 01:41:59,617
How strong is Arthur without Lancelot?

1071
01:42:00,493 --> 01:42:05,414
As strong as a man in the thick of battle
who has his sword struck from his fist.

1072
01:42:06,290 --> 01:42:08,918
A common pikeman
could run him through.

1073
01:42:13,047 --> 01:42:15,674
<i>Thus did Modred succeed in his intent.</i>

1074
01:42:16,175 --> 01:42:18,427
<i>The great bond was broken.</i>

1075
01:42:19,011 --> 01:42:23,098
<i>With the Queen taken from all men's eyes</i>
in sorrow and disgrace...

1076
01:42:23,224 --> 01:42:25,768
<i>and Lancelot banished from the land...</i>

1077
01:42:25,976 --> 01:42:28,354
<i>evil days returned to England.</i>

1078
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:36,529
Hearken, you who command
the opposing armies.

1079
01:42:37,696 --> 01:42:40,658
It is agreed that while this parley lasts...

1080
01:42:40,699 --> 01:42:43,244
that no knight shall draw his sword.

1081
01:42:43,744 --> 01:42:46,789
If any sword be drawn on either side...

1082
01:42:47,289 --> 01:42:50,751
a trumpet shall sound
and dreadful war begin.

1083
01:42:51,418 --> 01:42:54,588
Arthur Pendragon,
you asked for this truce.

1084
01:42:54,672 --> 01:42:56,549
What do you hope it shall gain you?

1085
01:42:56,632 --> 01:42:58,634
Modred, this carnage I seek to avert...

1086
01:42:58,717 --> 01:43:01,846
is unlike the old war
we fought against each other.

1087
01:43:01,929 --> 01:43:05,391
Once you led outlanders against me.
Enemies of England.

1088
01:43:05,891 --> 01:43:10,020
This time I lead Englishmen against you,
because you are the enemy.

1089
01:43:10,521 --> 01:43:13,649
If I must war against my people
and my knights...

1090
01:43:14,483 --> 01:43:17,653
the stroke that strikes them dead
is death to me.

1091
01:43:17,987 --> 01:43:20,114
The doom is yours, not mine.

1092
01:43:20,281 --> 01:43:23,993
Modred, beware!
None will emerge victor in this holocaust.

1093
01:43:24,034 --> 01:43:27,997
Friend will slay friend in this mist,
not knowing whom he slays.

1094
01:43:28,414 --> 01:43:32,001
Before us lies only the darkness
of utter destruction...

1095
01:43:32,084 --> 01:43:35,129
the end of chivalry,
the end of all our world.

1096
01:43:35,880 --> 01:43:38,757
In the name of God,
I beg you to forswear this war.

1097
01:43:38,841 --> 01:43:40,342
Upon my terms.

1098
01:43:42,052 --> 01:43:43,554
What are they?

1099
01:43:43,888 --> 01:43:47,433
First, you shall withdraw your armies
from all this land of the west.

1100
01:43:47,516 --> 01:43:50,436
Second, the lives and chattels
of the people of the west...

1101
01:43:50,519 --> 01:43:52,605
shall come under my domain.

1102
01:43:52,897 --> 01:43:55,983
Last, that the Round Table
shall be disbanded...

1103
01:43:56,567 --> 01:43:58,194
never to reassemble.

1104
01:43:58,277 --> 01:44:02,865
These are not terms to offer equals!
They are terms to shame the vanquished!

1105
01:44:04,992 --> 01:44:08,996
If I agree these terms,
will you pledge to wage no further wars?

1106
01:44:09,163 --> 01:44:10,998
If I be not provoked.

1107
01:44:15,085 --> 01:44:17,755
- I agree the terms.
- No!

1108
01:44:17,838 --> 01:44:19,882
Let it be done in writing!

1109
01:44:24,637 --> 01:44:25,888
Treason!

1110
01:45:18,858 --> 01:45:20,776
Arthur, my noble lord.

1111
01:45:22,444 --> 01:45:24,780
God forgive me. I come too late.

1112
01:45:25,281 --> 01:45:27,366
What place is this?

1113
01:45:27,825 --> 01:45:29,785
The chapel of the sword.

1114
01:45:29,994 --> 01:45:31,370
Excalibur.

1115
01:45:33,122 --> 01:45:35,207
Returning whence it came.

1116
01:45:36,500 --> 01:45:40,212
No longer bright, no longer glorious.

1117
01:45:42,173 --> 01:45:44,633
- Tarnished by my own hand.
- My lord.

1118
01:45:53,934 --> 01:45:56,479
Modred. You were right.

1119
01:45:57,688 --> 01:45:59,815
I should have destroyed him.

1120
01:46:00,191 --> 01:46:03,527
Therefore do it,
before he grows again in strength.

1121
01:46:04,695 --> 01:46:05,905
I will.

1122
01:46:06,363 --> 01:46:07,656
My sword.

1123
01:46:16,457 --> 01:46:19,126
Stained by the blood of my own people.

1124
01:46:21,879 --> 01:46:24,173
Cast it into the sea, Lancelot.

1125
01:46:25,216 --> 01:46:26,509
Swear it.

1126
01:46:26,842 --> 01:46:28,093
I swear.

1127
01:46:31,847 --> 01:46:33,474
Go to Guinevere.

1128
01:46:35,059 --> 01:46:36,477
Tell her...

1129
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:43,400
I love and forgive her.

1130
01:46:57,248 --> 01:46:58,916
Friend shall I be.

1131
01:46:59,917 --> 01:47:01,710
Call me none other.

1132
01:47:02,753 --> 01:47:05,881
This is a pledging
betwixt brother and brother.

1133
01:48:07,401 --> 01:48:10,154
Wait at the hall of the Round Table
until I join you there.

1134
01:48:10,237 --> 01:48:11,947
Let me go with you.

1135
01:48:12,698 --> 01:48:15,159
What I must do must be done alone.

1136
01:48:25,586 --> 01:48:28,005
I bring you sad tidings, my lady.

1137
01:48:29,048 --> 01:48:30,716
The King is dead.

1138
01:48:34,428 --> 01:48:37,473
His message to you was brief, two words.

1139
01:48:40,601 --> 01:48:42,144
What were they?

1140
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:45,898
Forgiveness and love.

1141
01:48:50,486 --> 01:48:51,821
Thank you.

1142
01:49:28,190 --> 01:49:30,693
- To the death!
- To the death.

1143
01:53:42,695 --> 01:53:44,071
What is it?

1144
01:53:46,782 --> 01:53:50,411
It was I who brought this fellowship
to ruin and to death.

1145
01:53:51,162 --> 01:53:53,372
My heart is too sick to pray.

1146
01:54:01,172 --> 01:54:02,465
The music.

1147
01:54:03,340 --> 01:54:05,092
Do you not hear it?

1148
01:54:05,593 --> 01:54:07,136
I hear nothing.

1149
01:54:12,850 --> 01:54:14,226
The light.

1150
01:54:14,935 --> 01:54:16,687
It almost blinds me.

1151
01:54:17,229 --> 01:54:19,273
But the hall is unchanged.

1152
01:54:27,239 --> 01:54:28,491
The cup.

1153
01:54:31,535 --> 01:54:32,620
Cup.

1154
01:54:34,038 --> 01:54:36,624
<i>Percival, my knight and servant...</i>

1155
01:54:37,208 --> 01:54:41,462
<i>this high vision is granted</i>
to such as are pure in heart...

1156
01:54:41,837 --> 01:54:45,883
<i>to the end that faith in what is eternal</i>
may be renewed.

1157
01:54:46,967 --> 01:54:50,513
<i>Of fellowship and honor, naught is lost...</i>

1158
01:54:51,263 --> 01:54:55,643
<i>and of all knights, Galahad,</i>
the son of Lancelot, shall be most worthy.

1159
01:54:56,435 --> 01:54:58,896
<i>Give comfort then to Lancelot...</i>

1160
01:54:59,730 --> 01:55:01,899
<i>whose guilt is all forgiven...</i>

1161
01:55:01,982 --> 01:55:04,652
<i>and whose heart shall now know peace.</i>

1162
01:55:05,528 --> 01:55:07,988
<i>Blessed be God who lives...</i>

1163
01:55:08,072 --> 01:55:12,451
<i>and moves in all things forever.</i>

1164
01:55:43,899 --> 01:55:44,608
English
