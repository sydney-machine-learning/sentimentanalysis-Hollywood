1
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,753
The second star to the right

2
00:00:51,836 --> 00:00:55,631
Shines in the night for you

3
00:00:55,715 --> 00:00:59,093
To tell you that the dreams you plan

4
00:00:59,177 --> 00:01:03,431
Really can come true

5
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:06,309
The second star to the right

6
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:10,855
Shines with a light so rare

7
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:14,859
And if it's Never Land you need

8
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:18,988
Its light will lead you there

9
00:01:19,071 --> 00:01:21,949
Twinkle, twinkle little star

10
00:01:22,033 --> 00:01:26,204
So we'll know where you are

11
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:30,291
Gleaming in the skies above

12
00:01:30,374 --> 00:01:33,086
Lead us to the land

13
00:01:33,169 --> 00:01:37,632
We dream of

14
00:01:37,715 --> 00:01:41,928
And when ourjourney is through

15
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:44,639
Each time we say

16
00:01:44,722 --> 00:01:47,683
Good night

17
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:53,523
We'll thank the little star
that shines

18
00:01:54,607 --> 00:01:58,903
The second from

19
00:01:58,986 --> 00:02:02,448
The right

20
00:02:06,702 --> 00:02:09,163
All this has happened before.

21
00:02:09,247 --> 00:02:12,375
And it will all happen again.

22
00:02:12,458 --> 00:02:15,461
But this time
it happened in London.

23
00:02:18,214 --> 00:02:22,593
It happened on a quiet street
in Bloomsbury.

24
00:02:22,677 --> 00:02:27,515
That corner house over there is
the home of the Darling family.

25
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,101
And Peter Pan chose
this particular house...

26
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:33,855
because there were people
here who believed in him.

27
00:02:33,938 --> 00:02:37,316
There was Mrs Darling.

28
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,404
George, dear, do hurry. We mustn't
be late for the party, you know.

29
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:45,992
Mrs Darling believed that Peter Pan
was the spirit of youth.

30
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:50,037
- But Mr Darling...
- Mary, unless I find my cuff links...

31
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:52,248
we don't go to the party.

32
00:02:52,331 --> 00:02:56,502
And if we don't go to the party, I can
never show my face in the office again.

33
00:02:56,586 --> 00:02:58,504
And if I can never... Ouch!

34
00:02:58,588 --> 00:03:02,467
Well, Mr Darling
was a practical man.

35
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,803
The boys, however,
John and Michael...

36
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:08,306
believed Peter Pan
was a real person...

37
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:12,018
and made him the hero
of all their nursery games.

38
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:14,145
Blast you, Peter Pan!

39
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,901
Take that! Give up,
Captain Hook? Give up?

40
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:23,112
Never! I'll teach you
to cut off me hand!

41
00:03:23,196 --> 00:03:26,532
Oh, no, John.
It was the left hand.

42
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:28,743
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Wendy.

43
00:03:28,826 --> 00:03:32,872
Wendy, the eldest,
not only believed...

44
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:35,541
she was the supreme authority
on Peter Pan...

45
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,543
and all his
marvellous adventures.

46
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:41,380
Oh, Nana, must we always
take that nasty tonic?

47
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:44,801
Nana, the nursemaid,
being a dog...

48
00:03:44,884 --> 00:03:47,386
kept her opinions to herself...

49
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:50,973
and viewed the whole affair
with a certain tolerance.

50
00:03:58,064 --> 00:03:59,565
Take that!

51
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:02,944
Insolent boy!
I'll slash you to ribbons!

52
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:05,863
And I'll cut you to pieces.

53
00:04:05,947 --> 00:04:08,449
- Aha!
- Ouch!

54
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:12,620
- Careful, Michael, my glasses.
- I'm sorry, John.

55
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:15,206
You'll never leave
this ship alive!

56
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:18,793
Oh, yes, I will.
Take that!

57
00:04:24,715 --> 00:04:28,636
Scuttle me bones, boy,
I'll slit your gizzard.

58
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:30,555
Oh, no, you won't.

59
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:33,933
Back, back, back, you villain!

60
00:04:34,016 --> 00:04:37,270
- Insolent pup!
- Wicked pirate!

61
00:04:37,353 --> 00:04:42,150
- Aha, I got ya.
- You didn't either.
You never touched me.

62
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:45,987
Take that and that!
And that!

63
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,281
Boys, boys,
less noise, please.

64
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,287
- Oh, hello, Father.
- You old bilge rat.

65
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,873
Wh-Wh-What?
Now, see here, Michael...

66
00:04:56,956 --> 00:05:00,710
Oh, not you, Father.
You see, he's Peter Pan.

67
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:03,796
- And John's Captain Hook.
- Yes, yes, of course.

68
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,549
Uh, have you seen my cuff...

69
00:05:06,632 --> 00:05:09,552
Oh, Nana,
for goodness sake!

70
00:05:09,635 --> 00:05:12,305
Where are those cuff links?

71
00:05:12,388 --> 00:05:16,726
- Cuff links, Father?
- Yes, the gold ones.

72
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:19,979
Michael, the buried treasure.
Where is it?

73
00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:22,190
- I don't know.
- The map then.

74
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:25,318
- Where's the treasure map?
- It got lost.

75
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:28,613
- Good heavens, my shirt front!
- Hurray! You found it!

76
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:31,282
- You found it!
- Yes, so I have.

77
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:34,660
And hereafter...
Don't paw me, Michael.

78
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:39,999
This is my last clean...
No! No!

79
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:42,835
George, dear, we really must
hurry or we'll be late...

80
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:46,672
- Mary, look!
- George.

81
00:05:46,756 --> 00:05:50,009
- It's only chalk, Father.
- Why, Michael.

82
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:53,012
It's not his fault.
It's in the story.

83
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:56,224
- And Wendy says...
- Wendy? Story?

84
00:05:56,307 --> 00:06:01,062
I might have known. Wendy!

85
00:06:01,145 --> 00:06:03,940
- Wendy!
- Yes, Father?

86
00:06:04,023 --> 00:06:07,110
- Would you kindly ex...
- Oh, Mother!

87
00:06:07,193 --> 00:06:10,363
- You look simply lovely.
- Thank you, dear.

88
00:06:10,446 --> 00:06:12,698
- Wendy.
- Just my old gown made over.

89
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:16,202
- But it did turn out
rather nicely, didn't...
- Mary, if you don't mind.

90
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:20,123
- I'd like...
- Why, Father, what have
you done to your shirt?

91
00:06:20,206 --> 00:06:24,127
What have l... Oh!

92
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:29,090
- Now, George, really.
It comes right off.
- That's no excuse.

93
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:34,220
Wendy, haven't I warned you?
Stuffing the boys' heads
with a lot of silly stories.

94
00:06:34,303 --> 00:06:37,140
- Oh, but they aren't.
- I say they are.

95
00:06:37,223 --> 00:06:39,725
Captain Crook!
Peter Pirate!

96
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:44,272
- Peter Pan, Father.
- Pan! Pirate! Poppycock!

97
00:06:44,355 --> 00:06:46,399
- Oh, no, Father. Father, have you...
- Oh, you don't understand.

98
00:06:46,482 --> 00:06:51,279
Absolute poppycock!
And let me tell you, this ridiculous...

99
00:06:51,362 --> 00:06:54,949
- Now, George.
- "Now, George."

100
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:57,160
"Now, George"!

101
00:06:57,243 --> 00:06:59,996
Well, "Now, George,"
will have his say!

102
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,250
- Please, dear.
- Mary, the child's growing up.

103
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,669
It's high time she had
a room of her own.

104
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:09,088
- Father!
- George!
- What?

105
00:07:09,172 --> 00:07:12,300
- No!
- I mean it!

106
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:16,095
Young lady, this is your
last night in the nursery.

107
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:19,265
And that's my last word
on the matter...

108
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:34,739
No!

109
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:38,284
No!

110
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:49,629
Oh!

111
00:07:51,798 --> 00:07:54,092
Poor Nana.

112
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:56,761
"Poor Nana"?

113
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:59,138
This is the last straw!

114
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:01,557
Out! Out, I say!

115
00:08:01,641 --> 00:08:04,560
- No, Father, no!
- Yes!

116
00:08:04,644 --> 00:08:07,730
There'll be no more dogs
for nursemaids in this house!

117
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:10,900
Goodbye, Nana.

118
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:16,948
"Poor Nana."
Oh, yes, "Poor Nana."

119
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:20,993
But "Poor Father"?
Oh, no!

120
00:08:21,077 --> 00:08:23,579
Blast it!
Where is that rope?

121
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,917
Oh, thank you.

122
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:34,799
Dash it all, Nana,
don't look at me like that.

123
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:37,260
It's nothing personal.
It's just that...

124
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:40,680
Well, you're not really
a nurse at all.

125
00:08:40,763 --> 00:08:43,850
You're, well, a dog.

126
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:47,019
And the children aren't puppies.
They're people.

127
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:51,190
And sooner or later, Nana,
people have to grow up.

128
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:54,193
But, Mother,
I don't want to grow up.

129
00:08:54,277 --> 00:08:58,531
Now, dear, don't worry
about it any more tonight.

130
00:08:58,614 --> 00:09:02,535
He called Peter Pan
"absolute poppycock."

131
00:09:02,618 --> 00:09:07,373
I'm sure he didn't mean it, John.
Father was just upset.

132
00:09:07,457 --> 00:09:12,128
Poor Nana,
out there all alone.

133
00:09:12,211 --> 00:09:15,256
No more tears, Michael.
It's a warm night.

134
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,550
She'll be all right.

135
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:20,386
- Mother.
- What is it, dear?

136
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,307
- Buried treasure.
- Now, children.

137
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,976
Don't judge your father
too harshly.

138
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:31,397
After all, he really
loves you very much.

139
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:34,108
Oh, don't lock it, Mother.
He might come back.

140
00:09:34,192 --> 00:09:37,862
- "He"?
- Yes, uh, Peter Pan.

141
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:42,033
You see, I found something
that belongs to him.

142
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:45,912
- Oh? And what's that?
- His shadow.

143
00:09:45,995 --> 00:09:49,457
- "Shadow"?
- Mmm, Nana had it.

144
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,585
But l...
I took it away.

145
00:09:54,087 --> 00:09:59,092
Oh? Yes, of course.

146
00:09:59,175 --> 00:10:01,511
Good night, dear.

147
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:07,600
But, George, do you think the children
will be safe without Nana?

148
00:10:07,683 --> 00:10:09,977
Safe? Of course
they'll be safe. Why not?

149
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:13,439
Well, Wendy said something
about a shadow, and l...

150
00:10:13,523 --> 00:10:16,317
- Shadow? Whose shadow?
- Peter Pan's.

151
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:19,987
Oh, Peter Pan...
Peter Pan!

152
00:10:20,071 --> 00:10:24,826
You don't say. Goodness gracious,
whatever shall we do?

153
00:10:24,909 --> 00:10:26,953
- But, George... Really, l...
- Sound the alarm!

154
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:29,872
- Call Scotland Yard!
- There must have been someone.

155
00:10:29,956 --> 00:10:33,376
Oh, Mary, of all the impossible,
childish fiddle-faddle.

156
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:38,131
Peter Pan indeed. How can we expect the
children to grow up and be practical...

157
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:40,675
- George, dear.
- When you're as bad as they are.

158
00:10:40,758 --> 00:10:43,636
- Please.
- No wonder Wendy gets
these idiotic ideas.

159
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:17,253
Over there, Tink,
in its den.

160
00:11:17,336 --> 00:11:20,173
Is it there?

161
00:11:22,008 --> 00:11:24,343
Must be here somewhere.

162
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:32,685
Tink! Shh!

163
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:36,856
Stop playing
and help me find my shadow.

164
00:11:36,939 --> 00:11:40,109
Shadow. Oh, shadow.

165
00:12:06,636 --> 00:12:09,388
Huh?

166
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:29,075
Aha!

167
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:42,797
Peter Pan! Oh, Peter!

168
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,300
I knew you'd come back.
I saved your shadow for you.

169
00:12:46,384 --> 00:12:48,469
Oh, I do hope it isn't rumpled.

170
00:12:48,553 --> 00:12:51,222
You know, you look exactly
the way I thought you would.

171
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:54,016
Oh, a little taller perhaps.
But then...

172
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,103
Oh, you can't stick it
on with soap, Peter.

173
00:12:57,186 --> 00:13:00,106
It needs sewing.
That's the proper way to do it.

174
00:13:00,189 --> 00:13:02,608
Although, come to think of it,
I've never thought about it before.

175
00:13:02,692 --> 00:13:06,863
Uh, sewing shadows, I mean.
Of course, I knew it was
your shadow the minute I saw it.

176
00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:10,199
And I said to myself, I said, "I'll
put it away for him until he comes back.

177
00:13:10,283 --> 00:13:14,287
Oh, he's sure to come back."
And you did, didn't you, Peter?

178
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:18,499
After all, one can't
leave his shadow lying about
and not miss it sooner or later.

179
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:23,796
Uh, don't you agree? But what
I still don't understand is how
Nana got it in the first place.

180
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,966
She really isn't... Oh, sit down.
It won't take long.

181
00:13:27,049 --> 00:13:30,052
She really isn't vicious, you know.
She's a wonderful nurse.

182
00:13:30,136 --> 00:13:32,513
- Although Father says...
- Girls talk too much.

183
00:13:32,597 --> 00:13:36,142
Yes, girls talk too...
Hmm? Oh.

184
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:39,854
- Well, get on with it, girl.
- Uh, my name is Wendy.

185
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:42,982
- Uh, Wendy Moira Angela Darl...
- Wendy's enough.

186
00:13:43,065 --> 00:13:46,736
Oh, uh, but how did
Nana get your shadow, Peter?

187
00:13:46,819 --> 00:13:49,489
Jumped at me the other night
at the window.

188
00:13:49,572 --> 00:13:51,157
Well, what were
you doing there?

189
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,244
- I came to listen to the stories.
- My stories?

190
00:13:55,328 --> 00:13:57,663
- But they're all about you.
- Of course.

191
00:13:57,747 --> 00:14:01,042
That's why I like 'em.
I tell 'em to the Lost Boys.

192
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,003
The Lost Boys...
Oh, I remember.

193
00:14:04,087 --> 00:14:05,880
- They're your men.
- Uh-huh.

194
00:14:05,963 --> 00:14:10,009
I'm so glad you came back tonight.
I might never have seen you.

195
00:14:10,093 --> 00:14:12,512
- Why?
- Because I have to grow up tomorrow.

196
00:14:12,595 --> 00:14:15,807
- Grow up!
- Tonight's my last night
in the nursery.

197
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:18,851
But that means
no more stories.

198
00:14:18,935 --> 00:14:21,437
- Mm-hmm.
- No!

199
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:23,689
I won't have it.
Come on!

200
00:14:23,773 --> 00:14:25,858
Bu-Bu-But
where are we going?

201
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:28,861
To Never Land.

202
00:14:28,945 --> 00:14:31,739
- Never Land!
- You'll never grow up there.

203
00:14:31,823 --> 00:14:36,285
Oh, Peter,
it will be so wonderful.

204
00:14:36,369 --> 00:14:39,956
But wait.
What would Mother say?

205
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,958
Mother? What's Mother?

206
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:47,088
Why, Peter, a mother is someone who...
who loves and cares for you.

207
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:50,591
- And... And tells you stories...
- Good! You can be our mother.

208
00:14:50,675 --> 00:14:52,593
- Come on.
- Now, just a minute, l...

209
00:14:52,677 --> 00:14:55,012
Let me see now.
L-I have to pack.

210
00:14:55,096 --> 00:14:58,307
Oh, and I must leave
a note when I'll be back.
Of course, I couldn't stay too long.

211
00:14:58,391 --> 00:15:01,561
And then I'll have to...
Oh, but Never Land.

212
00:15:01,644 --> 00:15:04,313
Oh, l...
l-I'm so happy l...

213
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:08,067
I think I'll give you a... a kiss.

214
00:15:10,737 --> 00:15:12,739
What's a... a kiss?

215
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:16,325
Oh, well, uh,
l-I'll show you.

216
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:18,453
- Oh!
- Stop! Stop it, Tink!

217
00:15:23,624 --> 00:15:26,753
John, John, wake up!
He's here.

218
00:15:26,836 --> 00:15:30,631
Huh? Jiminy!

219
00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:33,009
Ooh, what in the world was that?

220
00:15:33,092 --> 00:15:35,428
Tinker Bell.
Don't know what got into her.

221
00:15:35,511 --> 00:15:37,805
Hello, Peter Pan.
I'm Michael.

222
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:40,600
And my name is John.
How do you do?

223
00:15:40,683 --> 00:15:43,686
- Hello.
- Oh, look, a firefly.

224
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,147
- A pixie.
- Amazing!

225
00:15:49,025 --> 00:15:51,778
- What's the pixie doing?
- Talking.

226
00:15:51,861 --> 00:15:54,864
- What did she say?
- She says you're a big, ugly girl.

227
00:15:56,866 --> 00:16:00,411
Oh. Well, I think
she's lovely.

228
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,249
- Well, come on, Wendy, let's go.
- Where are we going?

229
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,543
- To Never Land.
- Never Land!

230
00:16:07,627 --> 00:16:09,629
- Peter's taking us.
- "Us"?

231
00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:13,132
Well, of course. L-I couldn't
go without Michael and John.

232
00:16:13,216 --> 00:16:16,969
Oh, I should like very much to cross
swords with some real buccaneers.

233
00:16:17,053 --> 00:16:21,140
Yes, and fight pirates too.

234
00:16:21,224 --> 00:16:24,310
Well, all right,
but ya gotta take orders.

235
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:26,813
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Me too.

236
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:29,482
But, Peter, how do
we get to Never Land?

237
00:16:29,565 --> 00:16:32,318
- Fly, of course.
- "Fly"?

238
00:16:32,402 --> 00:16:36,989
It's easy. All you
have to do is to... is to...

239
00:16:37,073 --> 00:16:40,076
Is to...

240
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:42,995
- Ha! That's funny.
- What's the matter?

241
00:16:43,079 --> 00:16:45,164
- Don't you know?
- Oh, sure.

242
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:48,668
It's... It's just that
I never thought about it before.

243
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:52,213
Say, that's it!
You think of a wonderful thought.

244
00:16:52,296 --> 00:16:55,049
- Any happy, little thought?
- Uh-huh.

245
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:58,344
- Like toys at Christmas?
- Sleigh bells, snow?

246
00:16:58,428 --> 00:17:01,055
Yep! Watch me now.
Here I go!

247
00:17:02,265 --> 00:17:04,892
It's easier than pie.

248
00:17:04,976 --> 00:17:07,687
- He can fly!
- He can fly!

249
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,398
He flewed!

250
00:17:10,481 --> 00:17:14,736
- Now you try.
- I'll think of a mermaid lagoon...

251
00:17:15,778 --> 00:17:18,364
underneath a magic moon.

252
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:20,742
I'll think I'm
in a pirate's cave.

253
00:17:20,825 --> 00:17:22,744
I think I'll be
an Indian brave.

254
00:17:22,827 --> 00:17:24,746
Now everybody try.

255
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:28,124
One, two, three!

256
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:32,128
We can fly! We can fly!
We can fly!

257
00:17:39,177 --> 00:17:41,763
This won't do.
What's the matter with you?

258
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:45,308
All it takes
is faith and trust.

259
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:49,353
Oh! And something
I forgot. Dust!

260
00:17:49,437 --> 00:17:52,106
- Dust?
- Dust?

261
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:57,403
Yep, just a little bit
of pixie dust.

262
00:18:02,658 --> 00:18:05,912
Now, think of
the happiest things.

263
00:18:05,995 --> 00:18:09,332
- It's the same as having wings.
- Let's all try it just once more.

264
00:18:09,415 --> 00:18:11,626
Look! We're rising off the floor.

265
00:18:11,709 --> 00:18:15,463
- Jiminy!
- Oh, my! We can fly!

266
00:18:15,546 --> 00:18:19,967
- You can fly!
- We can fly!

267
00:18:20,176 --> 00:18:24,639
Come on, everybody.
Here we go!

268
00:18:24,722 --> 00:18:26,140
Off to Never Land!

269
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:35,149
Think of a wonderful thought

270
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:37,944
Any merry little thought

271
00:18:38,027 --> 00:18:40,363
Think of Christmas
Think of snow

272
00:18:40,446 --> 00:18:45,284
Think of sleigh bells
Off you go like reindeer in the sky

273
00:18:45,368 --> 00:18:49,622
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly

274
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:52,792
Think of the happiest things

275
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,545
It's the same as having wings

276
00:18:55,628 --> 00:18:57,880
Take the path that moonbeams make

277
00:18:57,964 --> 00:19:03,386
If the moon is still awake
you'll see him wink his eye

278
00:19:03,469 --> 00:19:07,306
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly

279
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:10,643
Up you go with a heigh and ho

280
00:19:10,726 --> 00:19:12,937
To the stars beyond the blue

281
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,649
There's a Never Land
waiting for you

282
00:19:16,733 --> 00:19:21,362
Where all your
happy dreams come true

283
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:26,993
Every dream that you dream
will come true

284
00:19:27,076 --> 00:19:29,287
Come on, Nana!

285
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,874
When there's a smile
in your heart

286
00:19:32,957 --> 00:19:38,546
There's no better time to start

287
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:40,882
Think of all thejoy you'll find

288
00:19:40,965 --> 00:19:45,970
When you leave the world behind
and bid your cares goodbye

289
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:49,223
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly

290
00:19:49,307 --> 00:19:51,684
You can fly

291
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,114
There it is, Wendy. Second star to
the right and straight on till morning.

292
00:20:07,784 --> 00:20:10,995
When there's
a smile in your heart

293
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:15,541
There's no better time to start

294
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,422
Think of all thejoy you'll find
when you leave the world behind

295
00:20:21,506 --> 00:20:25,134
And bid your cares goodbye

296
00:20:25,218 --> 00:20:28,429
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly

297
00:20:28,513 --> 00:20:31,057
You can fly

298
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,768
You can fly, you can fly
You can fly

299
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,494
Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life

300
00:20:51,577 --> 00:20:55,415
A- rovin'over the sea
Give me a career as a buccaneer

301
00:20:55,498 --> 00:20:58,793
It's the life
of a pirate for me, oh

302
00:20:58,876 --> 00:21:01,379
The life of a pirate for me

303
00:21:02,755 --> 00:21:06,551
Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life

304
00:21:06,634 --> 00:21:08,511
They never bury your bones

305
00:21:08,594 --> 00:21:12,432
For when it's all over a jolly sea rover
drops in on his friend, Davy Jones

306
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:16,769
Oh, my good friend
Davy Jones

307
00:21:16,853 --> 00:21:22,108
- Good morning, shipmates.
- And what's good about it, Mr Smee?

308
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:26,612
Here we are, collecting barnacles
on this miserable island.

309
00:21:26,696 --> 00:21:30,533
While his nibs plays
ring-around-the-rosy with Peter Pan.

310
00:21:30,616 --> 00:21:32,410
Look out. It might go off.

311
00:21:32,493 --> 00:21:35,788
We ought to be tending to
the business of looting ships.

312
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:40,334
Why, I've almost forgotten
how to slit a throat.

313
00:21:40,418 --> 00:21:43,337
- Better hop it.
- And tell the captain...

314
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:46,132
we wants to put to sea, see?

315
00:21:50,636 --> 00:21:52,555
Peter Pan...

316
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:58,227
Blast that Peter Pan!

317
00:21:58,311 --> 00:22:02,482
If I could only find his hideout,
I'd trap him in his lair.

318
00:22:02,565 --> 00:22:04,650
But where is it?

319
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:07,320
Mermaid Lagoon?

320
00:22:07,403 --> 00:22:10,323
No, we've searched that.

321
00:22:10,406 --> 00:22:14,077
We've combed Cannibal Cove.

322
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,205
H-Here! No. No, no, no!

323
00:22:17,288 --> 00:22:20,625
That's Indian terri...

324
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:22,627
But wait.

325
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,590
Those redskins know this island
better than I do me own ship.

326
00:22:27,673 --> 00:22:29,592
Ah...

327
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:32,512
I wonder.

328
00:22:32,595 --> 00:22:35,181
- Good morning, Captain.
- I've got it!

329
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,016
Tiger Lily, Smee!

330
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,519
T-Tiger Lily, Captain?

331
00:22:39,602 --> 00:22:43,523
The Chief's daughter.
She'll know where Pan is hiding.

332
00:22:43,606 --> 00:22:46,609
B-B-But, but will she talk, Captain?

333
00:22:46,692 --> 00:22:51,197
Oh, a little persuasion
might be in order.

334
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,491
Now let me see.

335
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:56,536
Boiling in oil?

336
00:22:56,619 --> 00:23:00,665
Keelhauling? Marooning?

337
00:23:00,748 --> 00:23:05,211
A pirate's life
is a wonderful l-life

338
00:23:05,294 --> 00:23:09,549
You'll find adventure and sport

339
00:23:09,632 --> 00:23:13,386
But live every minute
for all that is in it

340
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:19,058
The life of a pirate is short

341
00:23:19,142 --> 00:23:23,896
Oh, the life...

342
00:23:30,027 --> 00:23:31,988
Now let me see, where was I?

343
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:34,365
Oh, dear, dear,
dear Captain Hook.

344
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:37,702
Shooting a man in
the middle of his cadenza?

345
00:23:37,785 --> 00:23:40,246
It ain't good form, you know.

346
00:23:40,329 --> 00:23:44,792
"Good form," Mr Smee?
Blast good form!

347
00:23:44,876 --> 00:23:48,713
Did Pan show good form
when he did this to me?

348
00:23:48,796 --> 00:23:53,509
Why, Captain, cutting your hand off was
only a childish prank, you might say.

349
00:23:53,593 --> 00:23:56,763
Aye! But throwing it
to the crocodile!

350
00:23:56,846 --> 00:23:59,849
That cursed beast liked
the taste of me so well...

351
00:23:59,932 --> 00:24:03,436
he's followed me ever since,
licking his chops...

352
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,147
for the rest of me.

353
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,608
And he'd have had
you by now, Captain...

354
00:24:08,691 --> 00:24:11,110
if he hadn't swallowed
that alarm clock.

355
00:24:11,194 --> 00:24:15,740
But now when he's about, he warns ya
as ya might say with his tick-tock...

356
00:24:15,823 --> 00:24:17,867
tick-tock, tick-tock.

357
00:24:47,897 --> 00:24:51,359
Smee? Smee!

358
00:24:51,442 --> 00:24:53,528
Oh, save me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee!

359
00:24:53,611 --> 00:24:56,906
Please, don't let him
get me, Smee! Smee!

360
00:24:56,989 --> 00:25:00,493
Here now, shame on ya.
Upsettin' the poor Captain.

361
00:25:00,576 --> 00:25:03,329
There'll be no handouts today.
Shoo now, shoo!

362
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:06,874
Go on, go on, off it. Off with ya,
I say, go away, go away, out of here.

363
00:25:11,337 --> 00:25:14,757
- Is he gone, Smee?
- Aye, Captain, all clear.

364
00:25:14,841 --> 00:25:17,885
- Nothin' to worry about.
- Oh, Smee, Smee.

365
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:20,346
I can't stand it any longer.
I tell you, I can't.

366
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,850
Now, now, now, now, Captain.
Just relax.

367
00:25:23,933 --> 00:25:26,394
What you need is a shave.

368
00:25:26,477 --> 00:25:31,190
A nice soothing shave.
There now.

369
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:34,902
Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life

370
00:25:34,986 --> 00:25:38,322
A- sailing over the sea
Give me a career as a...

371
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:41,075
Captain, you know,
I can't help noticin'...

372
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,747
you just ain't been
your usual jolly self of late.

373
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,832
Give me a career as a buccaneer

374
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:50,418
And the crew's gettin'
a might uneasy, Captain.

375
00:25:50,501 --> 00:25:52,837
That is,
what's left of it.

376
00:25:55,882 --> 00:25:59,552
Now, why don't we put
to sea, see? Leave Never Land.

377
00:25:59,635 --> 00:26:03,556
Forget Peter Pan.
There now!

378
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:06,058
Give me a career as a buccaneer

379
00:26:06,142 --> 00:26:10,104
We'd all be a lot happier,
not to mention a lot healthier.

380
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:18,863
Captain? Oh, dear! I never
shaved him this close before.

381
00:26:22,658 --> 00:26:26,329
Now, don't worry, Captain.
L-It must be somewhere about.

382
00:26:27,747 --> 00:26:30,291
Get up, you idiot!

383
00:26:30,374 --> 00:26:32,835
Aye, aye, sir.

384
00:26:34,212 --> 00:26:36,756
Ooh! I found it, Captain.

385
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:40,760
- Good as new.
- Why, you blithering blockhead!

386
00:26:40,843 --> 00:26:44,847
- Peter Pan ahoy!
- What? What? Where away?

387
00:26:44,931 --> 00:26:48,309
Three points off
the starboard bow!

388
00:26:48,392 --> 00:26:50,937
Swoggle me eyes!
It is Pan!

389
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,232
Headed this way with
some more of those scurvy brats!

390
00:26:54,315 --> 00:26:56,317
Mr Smee, pipe up the crew!

391
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:59,112
A-Aye, aye, sir. Uh, pipe up
the crew. Uh, pipe up the crew.

392
00:26:59,195 --> 00:27:01,823
All hands on deck!

393
00:27:01,906 --> 00:27:04,617
All hands on deck!

394
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,702
All hands on deck!

395
00:27:08,538 --> 00:27:10,456
All hands on deck!

396
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:15,378
Look alive, you swabs!

397
00:27:15,461 --> 00:27:19,298
- We've got him this time, Mr Smee.
- That we have, Captain.

398
00:27:19,382 --> 00:27:23,594
Man the Long Tom,
you bilge rats!

399
00:27:23,678 --> 00:27:27,098
- I've waited years for this.
- That's not countin'
the holidays either.

400
00:27:27,181 --> 00:27:29,475
Double the powder
and shorten the fuse!

401
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:31,811
Shorten the powder
and double the fuse!

402
00:27:31,978 --> 00:27:32,979
A pretty sight, Mr Smee.

403
00:27:33,062 --> 00:27:35,648
We'll pot 'em
like sitting ducks.

404
00:27:35,732 --> 00:27:39,986
- All right, men! Range 42.
- "Range 42."

405
00:27:40,069 --> 00:27:43,489
- Elevation 65.
- "Elevation 65."

406
00:27:43,573 --> 00:27:46,325
- Three degrees west.
- "Three degrees west."

407
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:51,748
Steady now! Steady!

408
00:27:51,914 --> 00:27:55,668
Oh, Peter, it's just as
I've always dreamed it would be.

409
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:58,212
Oh, look, John,
there's Mermaid Lagoon.

410
00:27:58,296 --> 00:28:03,176
By Jove!
And the Indian encampment!

411
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:06,345
Oh, look, there's
Captain Hook and the pirates.

412
00:28:09,182 --> 00:28:11,517
Look out!

413
00:28:13,436 --> 00:28:15,605
Quick, Tink, take Wendy
and the boys to the island.

414
00:28:15,688 --> 00:28:19,067
I'll stay here
and draw Hook's fire.

415
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:24,697
Hook! Hook!
You codfish! Here!

416
00:28:30,244 --> 00:28:35,666
Tinker Bell? Not so fast.
Please, Tinker Bell.

417
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,628
We can't keep up with you.

418
00:28:38,711 --> 00:28:41,881
Tinker Bell! Wait!

419
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,780
Ouch!

420
00:29:07,698 --> 00:29:10,451
So!

421
00:29:12,286 --> 00:29:15,289
- Who ya shovin'?
- Who ya shovin'?
- You! That's who!

422
00:29:15,373 --> 00:29:17,750
I'll show you!

423
00:29:23,548 --> 00:29:26,300
Huh? Orders from Pan?

424
00:29:26,384 --> 00:29:29,345
- Hold it, men!
- What's the orders, Tink?

425
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:34,934
- A terrible what?
- Wendy Bird.
- "Wendy Bird"?

426
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:38,855
- Flying this way?
- Uh, Pan's orders are...

427
00:29:38,938 --> 00:29:41,524
What? Smash it?

428
00:29:41,607 --> 00:29:43,943
- Kick it?
- Stomp it?
- Stomp it?

429
00:29:45,778 --> 00:29:48,489
- Oh! Shoot it down!
- Shoot it down!
- Yeah!

430
00:29:48,573 --> 00:29:50,950
- Yeah, shoot it down!
- Come on, follow Tink!
- Follow Tink!

431
00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:54,620
- Let's go!
- Yeah, come on. Let's go then!
- We're gonna get 'er!

432
00:30:11,387 --> 00:30:13,973
- I see it!
- Me too!
- Me too!

433
00:30:14,056 --> 00:30:17,518
Ready, aim...

434
00:30:17,602 --> 00:30:19,520
fire!

435
00:30:31,407 --> 00:30:35,328
Oh, Peter, you saved my life.

436
00:30:37,455 --> 00:30:40,917
- Are you hurted, Wendy?
- No, Michael.

437
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,003
Good heavens, Wendy,
you might have been killed.

438
00:30:44,087 --> 00:30:48,674
- Hey! Hey! Pan!
- We followed your orders, Pan!

439
00:30:50,843 --> 00:30:54,722
- Hey, Pan, I got it
with my skull buster!
- Ya did not! We did!

440
00:30:54,806 --> 00:30:58,017
- I did it, Pan! I did it!
- No, I did!

441
00:30:59,936 --> 00:31:03,481
Attention! Well...

442
00:31:03,564 --> 00:31:07,902
I'm certainly proud of you,
you blockheads!

443
00:31:07,985 --> 00:31:12,031
- I bring ya a mother
to tell ya stories...
- A mother?

444
00:31:12,115 --> 00:31:16,452
- And you shoot her down.
- Well, Tink said it was a bird!

445
00:31:16,536 --> 00:31:21,249
- Tink said what?
- Well, she said you said
to shoot it down!

446
00:31:21,332 --> 00:31:25,461
Tinker Bell. Tink!

447
00:31:25,545 --> 00:31:30,716
Come here. You're charged
with high treason, Tink.

448
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,595
Are you guilty or not guilty?

449
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:38,224
Guilty? But don't ya know
ya might have killed her?

450
00:31:40,643 --> 00:31:43,187
Tinker Bell!

451
00:31:43,271 --> 00:31:47,567
I hereby banish you forever.

452
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,153
Please, not forever.

453
00:31:50,236 --> 00:31:54,157
Well, for a week then. Come on, Wendy,
I'll show you the island.

454
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,993
Oh, Peter, uh, the mermaids?

455
00:31:57,076 --> 00:31:59,829
- Aw, let's go huntin'!
- Tigers?

456
00:31:59,912 --> 00:32:01,831
- Naw, bears.
- Naw, bears.

457
00:32:02,248 --> 00:32:04,584
Personally, I should prefer
to see the aborigines.

458
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:07,879
- And the Indians too.
- All right, men!

459
00:32:07,962 --> 00:32:10,631
Go out and capture
a few Indians.

460
00:32:10,715 --> 00:32:14,719
- John, you be the leader.
- I shall try to be worthy of my post.

461
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:16,763
Forward! March!

462
00:32:19,348 --> 00:32:23,269
- Come on, bear.
- Oh, Michael, do be careful.

463
00:32:23,352 --> 00:32:25,772
Come on, Wendy.
I'll show you the mermaids.

464
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:35,615
Following the leader
The leader, the leader

465
00:32:35,698 --> 00:32:39,368
We're following the leader

Tee dum, tee dee

Tee dum, tee dee
It's part of the game we play

468
00:32:46,751 --> 00:32:50,004
Tee dum, tee dee
The words are easy to say

469
00:32:50,088 --> 00:32:53,841
Just a teedle ee dum
a teedle ee do tee day

470

Tee dum, tee dee
A teedle ee do tee dum

We're one for all
and all of us out for fun

472
00:33:01,307 --> 00:33:04,560
We march in line
and follow the other one

473
00:33:04,644 --> 00:33:07,647
With a teedle ee do
A teedle ee di tee dum

00:33:23,704 --> 00:33:26,999
Following the leader
The leader, the leader

475
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:30,795
We're following the leader
wherever he may go

476
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:34,424
We're out to fight the Injuns
The Injuns, the Injuns

477
00:33:34,507 --> 00:33:38,010
We're out to fight the Injuns
because he told us so

478
00:33:38,094 --> 00:33:41,764
Tee dum, tee dee
A teedle ee do tee day

00:33:41,848 --> 00:33:45,435
We march along and

00:33:45,518 --> 00:33:48,521
Tee dum, tee dee

Oh, a teedle dee dum

482
00:33:52,525 --> 00:33:55,987
Oh, a teedle ee dum
A teedle ee do tee day

483
00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:00,408
Indians!
Oh, Blackfoot tribe.

484
00:34:02,076 --> 00:34:05,037
Belongs to the Algonquin group.

485
00:34:05,121 --> 00:34:07,540
- Quite savage, you know.
- Uh, let's go get 'em.

486
00:34:07,623 --> 00:34:11,085
- Come on! We'll get 'em!
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

487
00:34:11,294 --> 00:34:14,714
- First, we must plan our strategy.
- Uh, what's strategy?

488
00:34:14,797 --> 00:34:20,178
A plan of attack. The initial phase
is an encircling manoeuvre, thus!

489
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:51,959
John! Indians! Indians!

490
00:34:52,043 --> 00:34:54,337
Let me in!

491
00:34:57,173 --> 00:34:59,300
Now remember,
the Indian is cunning...

492
00:34:59,383 --> 00:35:01,511
- Hey...
- but not intelligent.

493
00:35:01,594 --> 00:35:05,014
Therefore, we simply surround them
and take them by surprise...

494
00:35:36,879 --> 00:35:40,633
I'm frightfully sorry, old chaps.
It's all my fault.

495
00:35:40,716 --> 00:35:44,762
- Aw, that's all right, Wildcat.
- Oh, we don't mind.

496
00:35:44,846 --> 00:35:46,514
That's okay.

497
00:35:50,685 --> 00:35:53,855
- How!
- Uh, h-how, Chief!
- How!

498
00:35:53,938 --> 00:35:58,401
For many moons red man
fight paleface Lost Boys.

499
00:35:58,484 --> 00:36:01,988
- Ugh.
- Ugh, ugh.
- Sometime you win.

500
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:05,199
- Sometime we win.
- Okay, Chief.

501
00:36:05,283 --> 00:36:08,202
Uh, you win this time.
Now, turn us loose.

502
00:36:08,286 --> 00:36:11,581
"Turn us loose"?
You mean this is only a game?

503
00:36:11,664 --> 00:36:13,833
Sure! When we win,
we turn them loose.

504
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:16,043
- When they win, they turn us loose.
- They turn us loose.

505
00:36:16,127 --> 00:36:18,671
This time, no turn 'em loose.

506
00:36:18,755 --> 00:36:20,673
- Huh?
- Huh?

507
00:36:20,757 --> 00:36:24,469
- The Chief's a great spoofer.
- Me no spoof'em.

508
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:26,929
Where you hide
Princess Tiger Lily?

509
00:36:27,013 --> 00:36:31,684
- Uh, Tiger Lily?
- We ain't got your old princess.
- I've certainly never seen her.

510
00:36:31,768 --> 00:36:36,022
- Me neither.
- Honest we don't.
- Heap big lie.

511
00:36:36,105 --> 00:36:39,984
If Tiger Lily
not back by sunset...

512
00:36:40,068 --> 00:36:43,529
burn 'em at stake.

513
00:37:02,423 --> 00:37:06,385
Just imagine,
real live mermaids.

514
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:09,347
- Would you like to meet 'em?
- Oh, Peter, I'd love to.

515
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,516
All right, come on.

516
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:17,230
- It's Peter.
- Oh!
- Hello, Peter!

517
00:37:17,313 --> 00:37:20,024
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello, Peter!
- Hello!

518
00:37:20,108 --> 00:37:22,235
Hello, Peter!

519
00:37:25,363 --> 00:37:28,699
- Hello, girls.
- I'm so glad to see you.

520
00:37:28,783 --> 00:37:33,246
Why did you stay away so long?
Did you miss me?

521
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:36,457
- Tell us one of your adventures.
- Something exciting.

522
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:39,836
Want to hear about the time
I cut off Hook's hand
and threw it to the crocodile?

523
00:37:39,919 --> 00:37:43,548
- Oh, I've always liked that one.
- Me too.

524
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:46,300
Well, there I was on
Marooner's Rock surrounded...

525
00:37:46,384 --> 00:37:48,761
- Oh, Peter!
- By 40 or 50 pirates.
- Who's she?

526
00:37:48,845 --> 00:37:52,390
Huh? Her?
Oh, that's Wendy.

527
00:37:52,473 --> 00:37:55,017
- A girl?
- What's she doing here?

528
00:37:55,101 --> 00:37:57,937
And in her nightdress too.

529
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,940
Come on, dearie.
Join us for a swim.

530
00:38:01,023 --> 00:38:03,109
- Oh, please, I'm not dressed for it.
- Oh, but you must!

531
00:38:03,192 --> 00:38:04,944
- We insist!
- No, no, please!

532
00:38:05,027 --> 00:38:08,948
- Too good for us, eh?
- Peter!

533
00:38:15,538 --> 00:38:19,459
- If you dare to come near me again...
- Wendy! Wendy!

534
00:38:19,542 --> 00:38:22,295
They were just having a little fun,
weren't you, girls?

535
00:38:22,378 --> 00:38:26,632
- That's all.
- We were only trying to drown her.

536
00:38:26,716 --> 00:38:29,635
- Ya see?
- Well, if you think for one minute...

537
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:32,930
- that I'm going to put up with a...
- Shh. Hold it, Wendy.

538
00:38:38,478 --> 00:38:42,482
- Yep, it's Hook, all right.
- Hook!
- Hook!

539
00:38:42,565 --> 00:38:44,525
Hook! Oh!

540
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:47,403
Quick, Wendy.

541
00:38:49,739 --> 00:38:52,408
They've captured Tiger Lily.

542
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,507
Looks like they're
headin' for Skull Rock.

543
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:11,010
Come on, Wendy.
Let's see what they're up to.

544
00:39:25,775 --> 00:39:29,821
Now, me dear Princess,
this is me proposition.

545
00:39:29,904 --> 00:39:34,200
You tell me the hiding place
of Peter Pan...

546
00:39:34,283 --> 00:39:36,202
and I shall set you free.

547
00:39:36,285 --> 00:39:39,163
- You dog.
- Poor Tiger Lily.

548
00:39:39,247 --> 00:39:42,208
Am I not a man of me word, Mr Smee?

549
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:45,711
Oh, yes, always, Captain.

550
00:39:45,795 --> 00:39:50,341
You'd better talk, me dear,
for soon the tide will be in...

551
00:39:50,425 --> 00:39:52,385
and then it will be too late.

552
00:39:52,468 --> 00:39:56,889
- I'll show the old codfish.
Stay here, Wendy, and watch the fun.
- "Fun"?

553
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,308
Remember...

554
00:39:59,392 --> 00:40:02,562
there is no path
through water...

555
00:40:02,645 --> 00:40:05,398
to the happy hunting ground.

556
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:09,819
This is your last chance,
Tiger Lily!

557
00:40:09,902 --> 00:40:14,407
Manatoa, great spirit
of mighty seawater, speak!

558
00:40:16,117 --> 00:40:18,953
Beware, Captain Hook!

559
00:40:19,036 --> 00:40:21,581
Beware! Beware!

560
00:40:21,664 --> 00:40:25,543
- Did you hear that, Smee?
- It's an evil spirit, Captain.

561
00:40:25,626 --> 00:40:29,756
Stand by, Smee,
while I take a look around.

562
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:33,259
Spirit of the great seawater, is it?

563
00:40:46,606 --> 00:40:50,193
Psst! Wendy. Watch this.

564
00:40:52,779 --> 00:40:56,282
- Mr Smee!
- Uh, yes, Captain?

565
00:40:56,365 --> 00:41:01,621
Release the princess
and take her back to her people.

566
00:41:02,872 --> 00:41:05,958
Aye, aye, sir.
Release the princess...

567
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:10,922
- But... But, Captain...
- Those are me orders, Mr Smee!

568
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:13,257
Aye, aye, sir.

569
00:41:16,886 --> 00:41:20,223
- Well, at last Captain Hook's
comin' to his senses.
- Odd's fish!

570
00:41:20,306 --> 00:41:23,434
I told him all along you Indians
wouldn't betray Peter Pan.

571
00:41:23,518 --> 00:41:28,064
And just what do you think
you are doing, Mr Smee?

572
00:41:28,147 --> 00:41:32,318
Just what you told me, Captain.
Carryin' out your orders.

573
00:41:32,402 --> 00:41:37,073
- My orders?
- Why, yes, Captain.
Didn't you just say to go...

574
00:41:37,156 --> 00:41:40,660
Put her back!
You blithering idiot!

575
00:41:40,743 --> 00:41:46,457
- My orders. Of all the bumbling...
- Mr Smee!

576
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:49,752
Just exactly what do you
think you are doing?

577
00:41:49,836 --> 00:41:52,380
Putting her back
like you said, Captain.

578
00:41:52,463 --> 00:41:54,674
I said nothing of the sort!

579
00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:57,718
Oh, but, C-Captain, d-d-didn't you?
I thought that...

580
00:41:57,802 --> 00:41:59,846
For the last time, Mr Smee.

581
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:04,100
Take the princess
back to her people.

582
00:42:04,183 --> 00:42:09,272
Understand? Understand?
Understand? Understand?

583
00:42:09,355 --> 00:42:13,317
- Uh, aye, aye, sir.
- Oh, and one more thing.

584
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:16,529
When you return to the ship,
tell the whole crew...

585
00:42:16,612 --> 00:42:19,323
to help themselves
to me best rum.

586
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:24,954
- Peter!
- Here's your spirit, Smee!

587
00:42:25,955 --> 00:42:28,124
Why, it's Peter Pan.

588
00:42:31,002 --> 00:42:33,379
- Scurvy brat!
- Thank you, Captain.

589
00:42:33,463 --> 00:42:37,383
Come down, boy,
if you've a taste for cold steel.

590
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:40,803
- Watch this, Wendy.
- Oh, Peter, do be careful.

591
00:42:54,108 --> 00:42:56,944
- Try your luck, Mr Smee?
- Let him have it!

592
00:42:58,488 --> 00:43:01,949
Well, come on, you idiot!
Blast him!

593
00:43:02,033 --> 00:43:04,577
Right here, Mr Smee.

594
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,830
Hold it, you fool!
No! No!

595
00:43:11,334 --> 00:43:14,087
Captain?

596
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,089
Oh, how dreadful.

597
00:43:16,172 --> 00:43:21,094
What a pity, Mr Smee.
I'm afraid we've lost the dear Captain.

598
00:43:23,846 --> 00:43:26,015
Captain!

599
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:27,850
In the back, Captain?

600
00:43:34,857 --> 00:43:36,901
Give it to him, Captain!

601
00:43:36,984 --> 00:43:39,779
Cleave him to the brisket.

602
00:43:51,582 --> 00:43:55,294
I've got you this time, Pan.

603
00:43:59,507 --> 00:44:03,636
Well, well, a codfish on a hook.

604
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:08,099
I'll get you for this, Pan,
if it's the last thing I do!

605
00:44:10,017 --> 00:44:13,062
I say, Captain,
do you hear something?

606
00:44:13,146 --> 00:44:15,398
No.

607
00:44:16,023 --> 00:44:17,400
No!

608
00:44:22,238 --> 00:44:24,240
No!

609
00:44:26,033 --> 00:44:29,245
Mr Crocodile,
do you like codfish?

610
00:44:29,328 --> 00:44:31,748
- You do?
- Oh, Peter, no!

611
00:44:39,922 --> 00:44:41,758
No!

612
00:44:43,426 --> 00:44:45,845
- Smee!
- D-Don't go away, Captain!

613
00:44:45,928 --> 00:44:49,390
Uh, stay right there now, sir.
I'll save ya, sir.

614
00:44:52,268 --> 00:44:54,437
Smee!

615
00:44:55,313 --> 00:44:56,856
Smee!

616
00:45:02,278 --> 00:45:05,782
Smee!

617
00:45:08,284 --> 00:45:09,994
Ow!

618
00:45:12,872 --> 00:45:14,791
Captain! Captain!

619
00:45:14,874 --> 00:45:18,669
Smee! Smee!

620
00:45:18,753 --> 00:45:20,671
- Give him back!
- Smee...

621
00:45:23,508 --> 00:45:27,804
Row for the ship!
Row for the ship...

622
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:32,141
Whoa!

623
00:45:35,686 --> 00:45:38,981
Smee!

624
00:45:40,817 --> 00:45:43,736
Peter, what about Tiger Lily?

625
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,364
Tiger Lily?
Oh, Tiger Lily.

626
00:45:48,324 --> 00:45:50,576
Help...

627
00:45:57,083 --> 00:46:00,711
Peter. Wait for me.

628
00:46:30,867 --> 00:46:34,495
That cursed Peter Pan.

629
00:46:35,872 --> 00:46:38,624
Making a fool out of me.

630
00:46:45,047 --> 00:46:47,925
Oh, my head.

631
00:46:53,556 --> 00:46:57,393
Oh, a pirate's life
is a wonderful life

632
00:46:57,477 --> 00:46:59,854
- Your hot water, Mr Smee.
- Shh!

633
00:46:59,937 --> 00:47:02,815
The poor Captain
has a splitting headache.

634
00:47:02,899 --> 00:47:06,110
We mustn't annoy him.

635
00:47:23,252 --> 00:47:27,965
Well, Captain, it's nice
to see you smiling again.

636
00:47:28,049 --> 00:47:32,553
Brings back the good old days when
we was leadin' a healthy, normal life.

637
00:47:32,637 --> 00:47:36,015
Scuttlin' ships, cuttin' throats.
Oh, Captain...

638
00:47:36,099 --> 00:47:38,518
why don't we put to sea again?

639
00:47:38,601 --> 00:47:41,854
You know, there's trouble
brewin' on the island.

640
00:47:41,938 --> 00:47:43,856
Women trouble.

641
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:47,235
I wouldn't want this
to go any farther, but...

642
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:51,197
the cook told me that
the first mate told him...

643
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,618
that he heard that Pan
has banished Tinker Bell.

644
00:47:55,701 --> 00:47:58,704
Whoa!

645
00:47:58,788 --> 00:48:04,127
Why, you doddering imbecile, l...
Did you say Pan...

646
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,921
has banished Tinker Bell?

647
00:48:07,004 --> 00:48:08,714
Aye, aye, Captain.
That he has.

648
00:48:08,798 --> 00:48:11,592
- But why?
- Well, on account of Wendy, Captain.

649
00:48:11,676 --> 00:48:15,722
Tink tried to do her in, she did.
Tink's terrible jealous.

650
00:48:15,805 --> 00:48:20,184
- Well, well.
- That's why we ought to leave, Captain.

651
00:48:20,268 --> 00:48:23,396
This ain't no place
for a respectable pirate.

652
00:48:23,479 --> 00:48:26,065
That's it, Smee!
That's it!

653
00:48:26,149 --> 00:48:28,109
I'm glad you agrees, Captain.

654
00:48:28,192 --> 00:48:31,237
Quick, me coat.
Me best dress coat.

655
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,906
Aye, aye, sir. The sooner
we get going, the better.

656
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:38,286
Ah, yes, a jealous female
can be tricked into anything.

657
00:48:38,369 --> 00:48:40,955
- My case of hooks!
- Aye, aye, sir.

658
00:48:41,038 --> 00:48:43,833
Here you are, sir.
Your Sunday set, sir.

659
00:48:43,916 --> 00:48:47,545
If we impress the pixie, convince her
we're eager to help her...

660
00:48:47,628 --> 00:48:50,673
the wench may chart
our course to a...

661
00:48:50,757 --> 00:48:53,593
certain hiding place.

662
00:48:53,676 --> 00:48:56,262
Our best hiding place
is the Spanish main, sir.

663
00:48:56,345 --> 00:48:58,598
I'll set our course...

664
00:48:58,681 --> 00:49:03,352
And where do you think
you are going?

665
00:49:03,436 --> 00:49:06,606
T-To tell the boys
we sails with the tide, sir.

666
00:49:06,689 --> 00:49:11,611
You will go ashore,
pick up Tinker Bell...

667
00:49:11,694 --> 00:49:15,031
and bring her to me.

668
00:49:16,157 --> 00:49:18,493
Understand?

669
00:49:18,576 --> 00:49:20,953
Aye, aye, s-s-s-sir.

670
00:49:31,422 --> 00:49:34,300
- How!
- How!

671
00:49:36,427 --> 00:49:38,346
What's the Chief doing, John?

672
00:49:38,429 --> 00:49:42,642
He's delivering an oration
in sign language.

673
00:49:42,725 --> 00:49:46,312
- What's he saying?
- He says...

674
00:49:46,396 --> 00:49:49,982
"Peter Pan, mighty warrior.

675
00:49:50,066 --> 00:49:52,151
"Save Tiger Lily.

676
00:49:52,235 --> 00:49:55,988
Make big Chief heap glad."

677
00:49:56,072 --> 00:49:59,325
Well, he certainly
doesn't look "heap glad."

678
00:49:59,409 --> 00:50:03,496
Make Peter Pan heap big chief.

679
00:50:03,579 --> 00:50:06,332
You now Little Flying Eagle.

680
00:50:08,418 --> 00:50:11,170
- Hurray for Flying Eagle! Flying Eagle!
- Hurray!

681
00:50:11,254 --> 00:50:13,631
Hurray!

682
00:50:13,714 --> 00:50:17,677
- Oh, how wonderful!
- Hurray!

683
00:50:27,854 --> 00:50:31,858
Teach 'em paleface brother
all about red man.

684
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:34,861
Good, this should be
most enlightening.

685
00:50:34,944 --> 00:50:37,530
Uh, what makes the red man red?

686
00:50:37,613 --> 00:50:39,866
- When did he first say, "Ugh"?
- First say, "Ugh"?

687
00:50:39,949 --> 00:50:42,201
Why does he ask you, "How"?

688
00:50:42,285 --> 00:50:45,538
"Why does he ask you, 'How'?"

689
00:50:45,621 --> 00:50:49,250
Hana mana ganda
Why does he ask you, how

690
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:54,714
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Once the Injun didn't know all
the things that he know now

691
00:50:54,797 --> 00:50:56,799
But the Injun
He sure learn a lot

692
00:50:56,883 --> 00:51:00,136
And it's all from asking how

693
00:51:00,219 --> 00:51:03,931
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
We translate for you

694
00:51:04,015 --> 00:51:07,226
Hana means what mana means
and ganda means that too

695
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:10,897
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

696
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,984
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

697
00:51:15,068 --> 00:51:18,279

00:51:18,362 --> 00:51:20,907
Squaw, get 'em firewood.

699

Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

What made the red man red

707
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:56,943
What made the red man red

708
00:51:57,026 --> 00:52:00,822
Let's go back a million years
to the very first Injun prince

709
00:52:00,905 --> 00:52:04,283
He kissed a maid and start to blush
and we've all been blushin'since

710
00:52:04,367 --> 00:52:07,286
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda

711
00:52:07,370 --> 00:52:09,038
Now you've got it right
from the head man

712
00:52:09,122 --> 00:52:10,832
The real true story
of the red man

713
00:52:10,915 --> 00:52:15,378
No matter what's been
written or said, no matter what

714
00:52:15,461 --> 00:52:23,469
Now you know why
the red man's red

715
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:36,816
- Wa-hoo!
- John!

716
00:52:36,899 --> 00:52:40,153
Squaw take 'em papoose.
Wa-hoo!

717
00:52:40,236 --> 00:52:44,490

- Squaw, get 'em firewood.

718
00:52:44,574 --> 00:52:47,660
Squaw no get 'em firewood!

719
00:52:47,744 --> 00:52:50,329
Squaw go home.

720
00:52:59,881 --> 00:53:02,049
Beggin' your pardon, Miss Bell...

721
00:53:02,133 --> 00:53:05,053
but Captain Hook
would like a word with ya.

722
00:53:19,025 --> 00:53:22,528
Yes, Miss Bell,
Captain Hook admits defeat.

723
00:53:24,322 --> 00:53:29,077
Tomorrow I leave the island,
never to return.

724
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,538
I'm glad to hear that, Captain.
I'll tell the crew and...

725
00:53:37,752 --> 00:53:40,254
And that's why I asked
you over, me dear...

726
00:53:40,338 --> 00:53:43,841
to tell Peter
I bear him no ill will.

727
00:53:45,635 --> 00:53:50,139
Oh, Pan has his faults,
to be sure.

728
00:53:50,223 --> 00:53:53,142
Uh, bringing that Wendy
to the island, for instance.

729
00:53:53,226 --> 00:53:55,144
Dangerous business, that.

730
00:53:58,689 --> 00:54:04,278
Why, rumour has it that already
she has come between you and Peter.

731
00:54:08,324 --> 00:54:12,537
But what's this?
Tears?

732
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:16,916
Then it is true.
Oh, Smee.

733
00:54:16,999 --> 00:54:20,086
The way of a man with a maid.

734
00:54:20,169 --> 00:54:24,924
Taking the best years
of her life and then...

735
00:54:25,007 --> 00:54:29,429
casting her aside
like an old glove!

736
00:54:29,512 --> 00:54:32,432
Ain't it a bloomin' shame?

737
00:54:32,515 --> 00:54:36,769
But we mustn't judge
Peter too harshly, me dear.

738
00:54:36,853 --> 00:54:40,565
It's that Wendy who's to blame.

739
00:54:40,648 --> 00:54:44,610
Mr Smee, we must
save the lad from himself.

740
00:54:44,694 --> 00:54:47,196
But how?

741
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,867
We've so little time.
We sail in the morning.

742
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:53,995
Sail! That's it, Smee!

743
00:54:56,456 --> 00:55:00,585
- We'll shanghai Wendy.
- "Shanghai Wendy," Captain?

744
00:55:00,668 --> 00:55:06,132
Take her to sea with us.
With her gone, Peter will soon
forget this mad infatuation.

745
00:55:06,215 --> 00:55:09,886
Come, Smee, we must leave immediately.
Surround Peter's home...

746
00:55:09,969 --> 00:55:15,475
But, Captain, we...
we don't know where Peter Pan lives!

747
00:55:15,558 --> 00:55:19,187
Great Scott,
you're right, Smee!

748
00:55:19,270 --> 00:55:20,646
What's that, my dear?

749
00:55:23,232 --> 00:55:27,320
You could show us the way?
Why, I never thought of that.

750
00:55:27,403 --> 00:55:31,324
- Take this down, Smee.
- "Take this down, Smee."

751
00:55:31,407 --> 00:55:33,493
Aye, aye, Captain.

752
00:55:39,582 --> 00:55:42,835
- Start at Pegleg Point.
- "Start at Pegleg Point."

753
00:55:44,587 --> 00:55:47,882
- Forty paces west of Blindman's Bluff.
- "Blindman's Bluff."

754
00:55:47,965 --> 00:55:53,221
Yes, yes. Hop, skip and
a jump across Crocodile Creek.

755
00:55:53,304 --> 00:55:57,892
Then north by northeast,
one, two, three.

756
00:55:57,975 --> 00:56:01,979
Well, get on with it...
Continue, my dear.

757
00:56:04,899 --> 00:56:07,735
I mustn't harm Peter?

758
00:56:07,819 --> 00:56:11,864
Madam, Captain Hook
gives his word...

759
00:56:11,948 --> 00:56:14,742
not to lay a finger...

760
00:56:14,826 --> 00:56:17,578
or a hook on Peter Pan.

761
00:56:21,416 --> 00:56:24,419
Ah, Hangman's Tree.

762
00:56:24,502 --> 00:56:28,965
So that's the entrance
to his hiding place.

763
00:56:29,048 --> 00:56:32,885
Thank you, me dear.
You've been most helpful.

764
00:56:39,517 --> 00:56:43,062
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

765
00:56:43,146 --> 00:56:46,899
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

766
00:56:46,983 --> 00:56:49,694
- Hana mana ganda, Hana mana ganda
- Hana mana ganda

767
00:56:49,777 --> 00:56:52,822
- Hana mana ganda
- What makes red men red

768
00:56:52,905 --> 00:56:56,659
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

769
00:56:56,743 --> 00:57:00,621
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda, hana mana ganda

770
00:57:00,705 --> 00:57:02,623
Hana mana ganda
Hana mana ganda

771
00:57:04,417 --> 00:57:07,795
Big Chief Flying Eagle
greets his braves.

772
00:57:07,879 --> 00:57:11,048
- How!
- Uh, how, Chief.
- How, Chief! How!

773
00:57:11,132 --> 00:57:12,675
- How.
- How.

774
00:57:12,759 --> 00:57:15,720
Big Chief greets Little Mother.

775
00:57:15,803 --> 00:57:18,264
- How!
- Ugh!

776
00:57:18,347 --> 00:57:21,601
Aw, Wendy, is that
all you have to say?

777
00:57:21,684 --> 00:57:25,229
- Everyone else thinks I'm wonderful.
- Especially Tiger Lily.

778
00:57:25,313 --> 00:57:28,316
- Tiger Lily?
- John! Michael!

779
00:57:28,399 --> 00:57:30,735
Take off that war paint
and get ready for bed.

780
00:57:30,818 --> 00:57:33,571
- Bed?
- Brave no sleep.

781
00:57:33,654 --> 00:57:35,907
Go for days without sleep.

782
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:38,117
- But, boys, we're going
home in the morning.
- Home!

783
00:57:38,201 --> 00:57:41,996
- And...
- Oh, Wendy, we don't want to go home.

784
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:46,667
No go home. Stay many moons.
Have heap big time.

785
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:49,504
Now, Peter, let's stop
pretending and be practical.

786
00:57:49,587 --> 00:57:53,007
Chief Flying Eagle has spoken.

787
00:57:53,091 --> 00:57:56,344
Oh, for goodness sake.
Please, boys.

788
00:57:56,427 --> 00:58:00,181
Do you want to stay here
and grow up like... like savages?

789
00:58:00,264 --> 00:58:02,183
- Of course.
- But you can't.

790
00:58:02,266 --> 00:58:05,728
You need a mother.
We all do.

791
00:58:05,812 --> 00:58:07,980
Aren't you our mother, Wendy?

792
00:58:08,064 --> 00:58:10,149
Why, Michael, of course not!

793
00:58:10,233 --> 00:58:12,402
Surely you haven't forgotten
our real mother!

794
00:58:12,485 --> 00:58:18,074
Did she have silky ears
and wear a fur coat?

795
00:58:18,157 --> 00:58:21,911
Oh, no, Michael.
That was Nana.

796
00:58:21,994 --> 00:58:23,913
I think I had a mother once.

797
00:58:23,996 --> 00:58:27,917
- What was she like?
- What was she like?
- I forget.

798
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,962
- I had a white rat!
- That's no mother!

799
00:58:31,045 --> 00:58:33,589
Hey, who ya shovin'?

800
00:58:35,133 --> 00:58:39,512
No, no, boys! Please.
I'll tell you what a mother is.

801
00:58:39,595 --> 00:58:42,140
- Yeah, tell us.
- Yeah, tell us.
- Please, Wendy.

802
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:45,518
Well, a mother,
a real mother...

803
00:58:45,601 --> 00:58:49,188
is the most wonderful person
in the world.

804
00:58:49,272 --> 00:58:52,859
She's the angel voice...

805
00:58:52,942 --> 00:58:55,319
that bids you good night...

806
00:58:55,403 --> 00:58:58,322
kisses your cheek...

807
00:58:58,406 --> 00:59:00,700
whispers, "Sleep tight."

808
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:05,037
Your mother

809
00:59:05,121 --> 00:59:09,000
And mine

810
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:14,005
Your mother

811
00:59:14,088 --> 00:59:18,134
And mine

812
00:59:18,217 --> 00:59:24,307
The helping hand
that guides you along

813
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:31,481
Whether you're right
Whether you're wrong

814
00:59:31,564 --> 00:59:35,318
Your mother

815
00:59:35,401 --> 00:59:39,489
And mine

816
00:59:39,572 --> 00:59:44,660
Your mother

817
00:59:44,744 --> 00:59:49,332
And mine

818
00:59:49,415 --> 00:59:54,837
What makes mothers
all that they are

819
00:59:54,921 --> 01:00:04,263
Might as well ask
what makes a star

820
01:00:04,347 --> 01:00:10,353
Ask your heart
to tell you her worth

821
01:00:10,436 --> 01:00:13,689
Your heart will say

822
01:00:13,773 --> 01:00:18,361
Heaven on earth

823
01:00:18,444 --> 01:00:22,865
- Another word
- Shh.

824
01:00:22,949 --> 01:00:27,745
For divine

825
01:00:27,829 --> 01:00:33,709
Your mother

826
01:00:33,793 --> 01:00:36,796
And mine

827
01:00:40,967 --> 01:00:45,888
- I wanna see my mother.
- Yes, Michael.

828
01:00:45,972 --> 01:00:48,391
I propose we leave
for home at once.

829
01:00:48,474 --> 01:00:51,436
- Could I go too? Huh, Wendy?
- Me too, Wendy!
- Come on! Let me go!

830
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:55,732
All right, boys. All right. I'm sure
Mother would be glad to have you.

831
01:00:55,815 --> 01:00:58,776
Uh, that is,
if Peter doesn't mind.

832
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:01,738
Go on!
Go back and grow up!

833
01:01:01,821 --> 01:01:05,032
But I'm warning ya.
Once you're grown up...

834
01:01:05,116 --> 01:01:07,285
you can never come back!

835
01:01:07,368 --> 01:01:10,705
- Never!
- Dear.

836
01:01:10,788 --> 01:01:14,542
- Well, then, shall we be off?
- Yeah, come on. Let's go!

837
01:01:14,625 --> 01:01:16,711
- Yeah!
- See ya, Peter.

838
01:01:18,296 --> 01:01:20,214
They'll be back.

839
01:01:25,303 --> 01:01:27,221
Peter.

840
01:01:30,475 --> 01:01:33,061
Goodbye, Peter.

841
01:01:40,818 --> 01:01:42,737
All right, men.
Take them away.

842
01:01:44,655 --> 01:01:50,411
And now, Smee, to take care
of Master Peter Pan.

843
01:01:50,495 --> 01:01:56,292
But, Captain, wouldn't it
be more humane-like to slit his throat?

844
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:59,087
Aye, that it would, Mr Smee.

845
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:02,924
But I have given me word
not to lay a finger...

846
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:06,427
or a hook on Peter Pan.

847
01:02:07,678 --> 01:02:12,517
And Captain Hook
never breaks a promise.

848
01:02:12,767 --> 01:02:16,521
Yo ho, yo ho
Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho

849
01:02:16,604 --> 01:02:18,689
So try the life of a thief

850
01:02:18,773 --> 01:02:20,691
Just sample the life of a crook

851
01:02:20,775 --> 01:02:22,777
There isn't a boy
who won't enjoy

852
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,696
A- workin'for Captain Hook

853
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:28,866
The world's most famous crook

854
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:33,538
Crook, crook, crickety
crockety, crickety, crick
the croc is after Captain...

855
01:02:34,872 --> 01:02:36,874
A special offer for today

856
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:39,085
I'll tell you what I'll do

857
01:02:39,168 --> 01:02:42,046
All those who sign without delay

858
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:44,757
Will get a free tattoo

859
01:02:44,841 --> 01:02:47,427
Why, it's like money in the bank

860
01:02:47,510 --> 01:02:50,388
Come on
Join up and I'll be frank

861
01:02:50,471 --> 01:02:54,600
Unless you do
you'll walk the plank

862
01:02:54,684 --> 01:02:56,602
The choice is up to you

863
01:02:56,686 --> 01:02:58,896
The choice is up to you

864
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:02,775
Yo ho, yo ho
Yo ho, yo ho, yo ho

865
01:03:02,859 --> 01:03:04,777
You'll love the life of a thief

866
01:03:04,861 --> 01:03:06,988
You'll relish the life
of a crook

867
01:03:07,071 --> 01:03:08,906
There's barrels
of fun for everyone

868
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:12,618
And you'll get treasures
by the ton

869
01:03:12,702 --> 01:03:16,831
So come and sign the book

870
01:03:16,914 --> 01:03:19,876
Join up with Captain Hook

871
01:03:19,959 --> 01:03:22,170
- Hey, I wanna join!
- Please! Oh, boy!

872
01:03:22,253 --> 01:03:25,548
- I wanna be a pirate!
- Oh, boy! A pirate!

873
01:03:25,631 --> 01:03:30,595
Boys! Aren't you
ashamed of yourselves?

874
01:03:30,678 --> 01:03:33,848
But Captain Hook is
most insistent, Wendy.

875
01:03:33,931 --> 01:03:37,268
Yeah! He says we'll walk
the plank if we don't.

876
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:40,855
Oh, no, we won't.
Peter Pan will save us.

877
01:03:40,938 --> 01:03:44,692
Peter Pan will save them, Smee.

878
01:03:45,943 --> 01:03:48,196
Peter Pan will save them.

879
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:52,158
Oh, Captain, you did it.

880
01:03:52,241 --> 01:03:54,994
But a thousand pardons, my dear.

881
01:03:55,078 --> 01:03:58,372
I don't believe you are
in on our little joke.

882
01:03:58,456 --> 01:04:02,710
You see, we left
a present for Peter.

883
01:04:02,794 --> 01:04:05,630
Sort of a surprise package,
you might say.

884
01:04:05,713 --> 01:04:09,175
Why, I can see our little
friend at this very moment...

885
01:04:09,258 --> 01:04:13,513
reading the tender inscription.

886
01:04:13,596 --> 01:04:18,226
"To Peter, with love
from Wendy.

887
01:04:18,309 --> 01:04:21,896
Do not open till 6 o'clock."

888
01:04:23,106 --> 01:04:25,024
Huh. I wonder what's in it.

889
01:04:25,108 --> 01:04:28,236
Could he but see
within the package...

890
01:04:28,319 --> 01:04:32,698
he would find an ingenious
little device.

891
01:04:32,782 --> 01:04:35,701
Set, so that when
the clock is like this...

892
01:04:35,785 --> 01:04:39,038
Peter Pan will be blasted...

893
01:04:39,122 --> 01:04:42,917
out of Never Land forever.

894
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,751
No!

895
01:04:48,464 --> 01:04:50,842
But time grows short.

896
01:04:50,925 --> 01:04:55,471
We have but 18 seconds.

897
01:04:55,555 --> 01:04:58,850
Fifteen seconds.

898
01:04:58,933 --> 01:05:01,728
Thirteen seconds.

899
01:05:01,811 --> 01:05:03,730
Twelve seconds.

900
01:05:03,813 --> 01:05:05,773
Well, I guess
I can open it now.

901
01:05:12,071 --> 01:05:14,824
Hey, Tink.
Look what Wendy left.

902
01:05:14,907 --> 01:05:18,327
Hey, stop that! Stop it!
What's the matter with you?

903
01:05:18,411 --> 01:05:20,580
Hook? A bomb?

904
01:05:20,663 --> 01:05:22,832
Don't be ridiculous!

905
01:05:31,966 --> 01:05:35,344
And so passeth a worthy opponent.

906
01:05:35,428 --> 01:05:37,346
Amen.

907
01:05:41,267 --> 01:05:44,187
Hook! It was a bomb!

908
01:05:44,270 --> 01:05:48,691
Why, if it hadn't been
for Tink... Tinker Bell!

909
01:05:53,112 --> 01:05:56,032
Tink? Tinker Bell?

910
01:05:58,951 --> 01:06:00,953
Where are you, Tink?

911
01:06:01,037 --> 01:06:04,373
Tink? Tinker Bell!

912
01:06:11,422 --> 01:06:14,717
Tink. Are you all right?

913
01:06:14,801 --> 01:06:18,679
Wendy? The boys?

914
01:06:21,432 --> 01:06:23,476
But I've gotta save you first.

915
01:06:23,559 --> 01:06:25,686
Hold on, Tink! Hold on!

916
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:29,023
Don't go out.
Don't you understand, Tink?

917
01:06:29,107 --> 01:06:32,693
You mean more to me than
anything in this whole world!

918
01:06:35,279 --> 01:06:40,410
And now, which will it be?
The pen or the plank?

919
01:06:40,493 --> 01:06:44,122
Captain Hook, we will
never join your crew.

920
01:06:44,205 --> 01:06:47,542
As you wish.
Ladies first, my dear.

921
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:51,045
- Goodbye, boys.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Goodbye, Wendy.

922
01:06:51,129 --> 01:06:55,091
- Be brave, John.
- I shall strive to, Wendy.

923
01:06:55,174 --> 01:06:58,720
- Goodbye, Michael.
- Goodbye, Wendy.
- Come on!

924
01:06:58,803 --> 01:07:01,472
- Get along over there!
- Get going, miss. Get going!
Don't give us no trouble!

925
01:07:01,556 --> 01:07:04,392
Go on! Go on!
Get it over with!

926
01:07:04,475 --> 01:07:07,395
- Move along!
- The Captain's waitin'!

927
01:07:14,902 --> 01:07:17,655
Wendy! Wendy!

928
01:07:22,076 --> 01:07:26,247
- Captain, n-no splash.
- Not a sound.

929
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:29,584
- Not a bloomin' ripple.
- It's a jinx, that's what it is.

930
01:07:29,667 --> 01:07:32,420
- No splash.
- No sign of the wench.

931
01:07:32,503 --> 01:07:36,340
- Did you hear a splash?
- I'm telling you, mates,
it's a black day.

932
01:07:36,424 --> 01:07:38,926
Mark me words.
We'll all pay for this.

933
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:41,304
The ship is bewitched.

934
01:07:41,387 --> 01:07:43,473
No splash, Captain.

935
01:07:43,556 --> 01:07:48,686
So, you want a splash, Mr Starkey.

936
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:51,064
I'll give you a splash!

937
01:07:51,147 --> 01:07:53,691
- Who's next?
- You're next, Hook!

938
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:57,695
- This time you've gone too far!
- It's Pan! Peter Pan!

939
01:07:57,779 --> 01:07:59,781
- And Wendy!
- It can't be!

940
01:07:59,864 --> 01:08:02,075
It's his blinkin' ghost
what's talkin'!

941
01:08:02,158 --> 01:08:03,993
Say your prayers, Hook.

942
01:08:04,077 --> 01:08:08,498
I'll show you this ghost
has blood in his veins.

943
01:08:08,581 --> 01:08:11,542
I'll run him through! Ooh!

944
01:08:11,626 --> 01:08:13,628
Take that!

945
01:08:20,551 --> 01:08:22,178
Curse this hook!

946
01:08:23,971 --> 01:08:25,973
Come on, everybody!

947
01:08:29,394 --> 01:08:32,313
Hurry, Michael! Hurry!

948
01:08:32,397 --> 01:08:35,358
Don't stand there,
you bilge rats!

949
01:08:35,441 --> 01:08:38,528
Get those scurvy brats!

950
01:08:38,611 --> 01:08:41,489
After the brats, men!

951
01:09:06,764 --> 01:09:08,808
This is no mere boy.

952
01:09:08,891 --> 01:09:12,520
'Tis some fiend fighting me.
A flying devil!

953
01:09:20,403 --> 01:09:22,488
- Hold your fire.
- Get 'em!

954
01:09:22,572 --> 01:09:25,742
Steady, men. Steady.

955
01:09:25,825 --> 01:09:27,827
- Club 'em with the marline.
- Fire!

956
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:31,497
- I'll crack their bloomin' skulls!
- Let me at 'em!

957
01:09:31,581 --> 01:09:34,208
Down, you blackguard!

958
01:10:10,411 --> 01:10:12,121
Hurray!

959
01:10:17,043 --> 01:10:21,881
- Right through, Michael.
- Yea, Bear Killer!
- Yea for Bear Killer!

960
01:10:21,964 --> 01:10:25,134
Fly! Fly! Fly! You coward!

961
01:10:25,218 --> 01:10:26,928
Coward? Me?

962
01:10:27,095 --> 01:10:32,225
Ha-ha-ha! You wouldn't dare fight
old Hook man-to-man!

963
01:10:32,308 --> 01:10:34,852
You'd fly away like
a cowardly sparrow!

964
01:10:34,936 --> 01:10:38,022
Nobody calls Pan
a coward and lives!

965
01:10:38,106 --> 01:10:41,067
I'll fight you man-to-man,
with one hand behind my back.

966
01:10:42,610 --> 01:10:47,407
- You mean you won't fly?
- No, don't, Peter! It's a trick!

967
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:51,744
- I give my word, Hook.
- Good, then let's have at it!

968
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:17,687
Now! Insolent youth,
prepare to die!

969
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:20,481
Fly! Fly, Peter! Fly!

970
01:11:20,565 --> 01:11:24,652
No! I gave my word.

971
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:30,366
You're mine, Hook!

972
01:11:31,951 --> 01:11:35,288
Cleave him to the brisket!

973
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:40,001
You wouldn't do old Hook
in now, would you, lad?

974
01:11:40,084 --> 01:11:44,589
I'll go away forever.
I'll do anything you say.

975
01:11:44,672 --> 01:11:50,344
Well, all right.
If ya say you're a codfish.

976
01:11:50,428 --> 01:11:53,806
- I'm a codfish.
- Louder!

977
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:58,311
- I'm a codfish!
- Hurray!

978
01:11:58,394 --> 01:12:02,732
Hook is a codfish
A codfish, a codfish

979
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:07,070
- Hook is a codfish, a codfish, a codfish
- All right, Hook...

980
01:12:07,153 --> 01:12:11,365
you're free to go,
and never return.

981
01:12:14,869 --> 01:12:16,871
Peter!

982
01:12:25,171 --> 01:12:27,715
Smee! Smee!

983
01:12:41,479 --> 01:12:43,398
Smee!

984
01:12:45,149 --> 01:12:50,238
Smee! Smee!

985
01:12:50,321 --> 01:12:54,409
Smee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee-ee!

986
01:12:54,492 --> 01:12:57,078
Captain!

987
01:12:57,161 --> 01:12:59,247
Captain! Captain!

988
01:13:00,748 --> 01:13:02,250
Hurray!

989
01:13:03,334 --> 01:13:06,838
Hurray for Captain Pan!

990
01:13:06,921 --> 01:13:10,174
All right, ya swabs,
aloft with ya!

991
01:13:10,258 --> 01:13:14,303
We're castin' off!
Heave those halyards!

992
01:13:14,387 --> 01:13:18,349
But, but, Peter...
Oh, that is, Captain Pan.

993
01:13:18,433 --> 01:13:23,521
- At your service, madam.
- Could you tell me, sir,
where we're sailing?

994
01:13:23,604 --> 01:13:27,525
- To London, madam.
- Oh, Peter.

995
01:13:27,608 --> 01:13:31,529
Michael! John!
We're going home!

996
01:13:31,612 --> 01:13:34,365
Man the capstan!

997
01:13:34,449 --> 01:13:37,201
Hoist anchor!

998
01:13:39,954 --> 01:13:41,998
Pixie dust!

999
01:14:20,286 --> 01:14:25,208
George, I am so glad you
changed your mind about Wendy.
After all, she's still a child.

1000
01:14:25,291 --> 01:14:29,504
Oh, pshaw, Mary.
You know I never mean those things.

1001
01:14:29,587 --> 01:14:31,547
Do I, Nana?

1002
01:14:33,966 --> 01:14:37,387
Oh! Wendy!

1003
01:14:39,764 --> 01:14:43,017
Wendy, what on earth
are you doing there?

1004
01:14:43,101 --> 01:14:45,561
Mmm. Hmm?

1005
01:14:47,939 --> 01:14:50,566
- Oh, Mother, we're back!
- Back?

1006
01:14:50,650 --> 01:14:53,528
All except the Lost Boys.
They weren't quite ready.

1007
01:14:53,611 --> 01:14:56,072
- Lost Bo... Ready?
- To grow up.

1008
01:14:56,155 --> 01:14:58,491
That's why they went
back to Never Land.

1009
01:14:58,574 --> 01:15:01,661
- Never Land?
- Yes, but I am.

1010
01:15:01,744 --> 01:15:05,373
- Uh, "am"?
- Uh, ready to grow up.

1011
01:15:05,456 --> 01:15:07,708
Oh! Oh! Uh...

1012
01:15:07,792 --> 01:15:11,379
Well, my dear,
all in good time.

1013
01:15:11,462 --> 01:15:14,215
- After all, perhaps we were too...
- Oh, but, Mother...

1014
01:15:14,298 --> 01:15:16,884
it was such a wonderful adventure.

1015
01:15:16,968 --> 01:15:19,721
Tinker Bell and the mermaids
and Peter Pan.

1016
01:15:19,804 --> 01:15:21,723
Oh, he was the most
wonderful of all.

1017
01:15:21,806 --> 01:15:24,892
- Why, why, even when
we were kidnapped, l...
- Kidnapped!

1018
01:15:24,976 --> 01:15:28,646
Mm-hmm. I knew Peter Pan
would save us, and he did.

1019
01:15:28,730 --> 01:15:31,566
And we all called him a codfish!

1020
01:15:31,649 --> 01:15:33,735
Uh, Captain Hook, I mean.

1021
01:15:33,818 --> 01:15:37,655
And then we sailed away
on a ship in the sky.

1022
01:15:37,739 --> 01:15:42,243
Hmm. Mary, I'm going to bed.

1023
01:15:42,326 --> 01:15:47,248
Oh, Mother.
He really is wonderful, isn't he?

1024
01:15:47,331 --> 01:15:50,501
See how well he sails the ship.

1025
01:15:50,585 --> 01:15:55,256
- George. George!
- Now what, Mary?

1026
01:15:58,092 --> 01:16:00,303
Nana, d-did you see...

1027
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:05,099
You know, I have
the strangest feeling...

1028
01:16:05,183 --> 01:16:07,602
that I've seen that ship before.

1029
01:16:07,685 --> 01:16:10,021
A long time ago...

1030
01:16:10,104 --> 01:16:12,648
when I was very young.

1031
01:16:12,732 --> 01:16:17,028
- George, dear.
- Father.

1032
01:16:17,111 --> 01:16:20,364
When there's a smile in your heart

1033
01:16:20,448 --> 01:16:25,703
There's no better time to start

1034
01:16:25,787 --> 01:16:27,872
Think of all thejoy you'll find

1035
01:16:27,955 --> 01:16:29,874
When you leave the world behind

1036
01:16:29,957 --> 01:16:33,461
And bid your cares goodbye

1037
01:16:33,544 --> 01:16:36,214
You can fly

1038
01:16:36,297 --> 01:16:38,716
You can fly

1039
01:16:39,967 --> 01:16:44,722
You can fly
