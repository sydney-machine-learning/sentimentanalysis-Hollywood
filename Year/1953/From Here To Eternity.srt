1
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,709
One, two, three, four.

2
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,198
Hey, Maggio! Hello!

3
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,075
Hiya, Prew.

4
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,875
What are you doing over here?

5
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,112
Transferred over from Fort Shafter.

6
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,712
- You quit the Bugle Corps?
- Yup.

7
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,114
For here?

8
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,838
I didn't pick it.

9
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,071
You made a very bad mistake.

10
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,395
This outfit, they can give back Custer.

11
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,390
Yeah?

12
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,597
Captain ain't in yet.

13
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,678
I'll look around.

14
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,635
What do you think you're doing?

15
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:31,199
- Whas your name?
- Prewitt. Transfer from Fort Shafter.

16
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,349
I heard about you.

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,831
I heard about you, too, Sergeant.

18
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,792
This here's a rifle outfit, Prewitt.

19
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,519
You ain't supposed to enjoy yourself
before sundown.

20
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,875
Put up your cue and come along.

21
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,996
Grand went to the hospital yesterday.
You put him in the sick book?

22
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,594
- Didn't have time.
- You're the company clerk, Mazzioli.

23
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,116
The medics returned the sick book
late yesterday. I'll do it now.

24
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,634
Thanks, I already done it for you.

25
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,554
You're the best bugler
they got over at Shafter.

26
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,110
- You're the best bugler on this island.
- Thas true.

27
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,473
I feel for you, pal.

28
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,552
But from my position,
I can't quite reach you.

29
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,869
Ten-hut!

30
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,349
At ease.

31
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,237
- 'Morning, sir.
- 'Morning, men.

32
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,675
Anything special for me?
I've only a few minutes.

33
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,716
Yes, sir. New man here.

34
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,552
Oh, yes. Come in.

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,709
Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, reporting
to the Company Commander, as ordered.

36
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,473
At ease. Where's that service record?

37
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,398
"Born in Kentucky.
Enlisted first at Fort Meyer, Virginia.

38
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,550
"Bugle Corps, First Bugler."

39
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,077
Prewitt, I always make it a policy
to talk to my new men.

40
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,230
Now, I have a fine, smooth-running outfit.

41
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,553
If I like a soldier, he can become
a non-commissioned officer quickly.

42
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,071
But he has to show me
that he's got it on the ball.

43
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,196
What trouble were you in,
in the Bugle Corps?

44
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,315
No trouble, sir.

45
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,032
What made you transfer out, then?

46
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,715
It was a personal matter.

47
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,038
- Something you wanted to ask, Sergeant?
- Why, yes, sir.

48
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,435
Prewitt, you was a corporal
in the Bugle Corps.

49
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,877
You took a bust to buck private
to transfer to an infantry outfit. Why?

50
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,396
Because you like to hike, or was it
because you couldn't stand to bugle?

51
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,399
It was a personal matter.

52
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,114
Thas up to the Company Commander
to decide.

53
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,189
Well?

54
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,476
I was First Bugler for two years.

55
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,677
The Top Kick had a friend
who transferred in from another outfit.

56
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,035
The next day he was made
First Bugler over me.

57
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,953
I was a better bugler.

58
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,634
And you asked out on account of that?

59
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,880
Maybe it ain't sensible,
but thas the reason.

60
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,758
His feelings were hurt.
Kids they send us now!

61
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,395
We'll get your stripes back for you,
maybe an extra one for good measure.

62
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,675
- Know why you're assigned to G Company?
- No, sir.

63
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,635
I pulled a few strings. I'm the regimental
boxing coach, you know.

64
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,475
Yes, sir.

65
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,479
I saw your fight with Connors in the Bowl
year before last. You should have won.

66
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,549
Thank you, sir.

67
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:23,799
Our regiment got beaten in the finals
last December, but I mean to win this year.

68
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,711
All I've needed is a top middleweight.

69
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,998
I'm sorry, sir. I quit fighting.

70
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,469
Quit fighting? When? What for?

71
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,631
Well, over a year ago.

72
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,869
Maybe you heard about what happened
with Dixie Wells?

73
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,074
- You mean that fellow that got hurt?
- Yes, sir.

74
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,878
Yes, I heard about that. Is too bad.

75
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,554
I can understand how you feel,
but those things happen.

76
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,631
Thas why I decided I would quit, sir.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,231
You might as well say stop war
because one man got killed.

78
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,835
Our fighting programme
is the best morale builder we have.

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,834
I've got a mighty sour company bugler.
How'd you like the job?

80
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,989
Not if it means fighting.

81
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,870
Looks to me as if you're trying to acquire
a reputation as a lone wolf.

82
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,552
You should know that in the Army
is not the individual that counts.

83
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,189
You'll find that we won't put
any pressure on you in my outfit.

84
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,397
Just don't make any mistakes in it,
thas all.

85
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,916
I'm going to town.
Anything else, Sergeant?

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,956
Company fund repors due tomorrow.

87
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,600
- You make it out. Is that all?
- No, sir.

88
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,636
Whatever it is, you fix it up.

89
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,234
If anything has to go in this afternoon,
sign my name.

90
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,436
- I won't be back.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,558
He'd strangle in his own spit
if I wasn't here to swab his throat out.

92
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,949
Come on.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,833
You been in the Army what now?
Five years? Five and a half?

94
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,909
Yeah.

95
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,992
Don't you think is about time
you got smart?

96
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,192
You know what you did just now,
turning down Dynamite Holmes?

97
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,918
You put your head in the noose.

98
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,951
Things are soft for a boxer in this outfit.

99
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,951
Otherwise, you better know how to soldier.

100
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,076
I can soldier with any man.

101
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,669
This place is getting to be like
the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.

102
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,438
- Who's that?
- She's Captain Holmes' wife.

103
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,679
You'll fight, Prewitt, because
Captain Holmes wants to be Major Holmes.

104
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,752
He's got an idea he'll make it
if he gets a winning team.

105
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,916
If you don't do it for him, do it for me.

106
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,831
'Cause my job is to keep him happy, see?

107
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,277
More he's happy, the less he bothers me,
and the better I run this company.

108
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,954
So, we know where we stand,
don't we, kid?

109
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,271
I know where I stand.
A man don't go his own way he's nothing.

110
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,231
Maybe back in the days of the pioneers
a man could go his own way.

111
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,595
But today, you got to play ball.

112
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,229
Leva!

113
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,437
Can't I once find you in the supply room
working with both hands?

114
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,988
I can't do no better
on what you people pay me.

115
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,799
Draw this man some supplies.

116
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,396
G Company squad room is on the top floor.
Take your bags then come here.

117
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,758
Leva will help you lug your stuff upstairs.
Save you making four or five trips.

118
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,829
Thanks.

119
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,038
I just hate to see energy wasted.
Besides, you'll be needing yours.

120
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,591
Looks like a good man.

121
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,628
I know his type. He's a hardhead.

122
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,115
Her and them sweaters.

123
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,712
I'll bet she's colder than an iceberg.

124
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,077
Not her, Top. She knows the score.
Like I been telling you.

125
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,639
Is that right?

126
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,630
Not around here, but when I soldiered
at Fort Bliss, I heard plenty about this lady.

127
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,872
- You did?
- Okay, not me.

128
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,350
But I know some of the guys
she played around with, so don't tell me.

129
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,079
I'm not telling you. You're telling me.

130
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,310
- Good morning, Sergeant.
- 'Morning, ma'am.

131
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,515
I'm looking for my husband.

132
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,189
Captain Holmes just went into town.
On business.

133
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,597
He was to have left some things for me.
Do you know about them?

134
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,514
No, I don't, ma'am.
Anything I can do for you?

135
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,513
No, thanks.

136
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,990
I'd be glad to help, ma'am.

137
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,311
My husbanïs been telling me
a lot about you, Sergeant.

138
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,873
He says you're very efficient.

139
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,749
Yes, ma'am.

140
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,675
What is it that makes you
so efficient, Sergeant?

141
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,353
I was born smart, ma'am.

142
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,633
I love that.

143
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,551
Well, good-bye, Sergeant.

144
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,837
Man, she sure is one, ain't she?

145
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,035
One what?

146
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,348
One woman.

147
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,078
I've seen better.

148
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,075
Karen?

149
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,668
- Sorry I'm late.
- It doesn't matter.

150
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,509
I got tied up with General Slater.
I bumped into him in the Officers' Club.

151
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,239
Yeah? What did the General have to say?

152
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,958
Success, he said.

153
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,793
Success in war, success in peacetime.

154
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,594
Not a word about my promotion.

155
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,838
Sometimes I think the old man's
just waiting to ship me down.

156
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,673
Less time buttering generals
and more with your company...

157
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,117
...maybe you'd get that promotion.
- The company takes care of itself.

158
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,953
I went over there today looking for you.

159
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,157
I had some business to attend to
at Kaneohe.

160
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,637
That was all right, wasn't it?

161
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,039
Of course.

162
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,631
I've no right to inquire into your actions.
That was our agreement.

163
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,039
Then why bring it up?

164
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,908
Because I wanted you to know I'm not
as stupid as you maintain all women are.

165
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,592
Now, just what does that mean?

166
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,113
What are you accusing me of now?

167
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,235
Of nothing.

168
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,278
Is no longer my business
how many women you go out with.

169
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,272
But I wish you could just be honest
about it once.

170
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,828
No reason I should try to hide anything,
is there...

171
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,354
...the way things are between us now?

172
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,712
What right have you
to always be accusing me?

173
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,468
What right?

174
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,709
Are you going back to that again?

175
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,395
How long will it be, I wonder,
before I'm allowed to live that down?

176
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,676
How many times must I say
it was an accident?

177
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,118
Please, Dana.

178
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,229
I'm going to bed.

179
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,155
Please get out of my bedroom.

180
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,356
Captain Holmes says you don't want
to come out and fight for us.

181
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,634
Thas right.

182
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,837
We thought we'd buy you a beer
and talk it over.

183
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,629
We're the company boxers.

184
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,879
I figured.

185
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,196
What I wouldn't give to have this guy
in a corner poolroom in my hometown!

186
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,958
If you box as good as you used to,
we'd be a cinch this year.

187
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,318
You ain't forget, division champs
get ten-day furloughs, did you, son?

188
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,316
I'm lke Galovitch.
Platoon guide of your platoon.

189
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,789
And don't think
you're a tough guy, Prewitt.

190
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,395
You no talk now, but out in the field
with us you sing different song.

191
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,597
He don't have to fight if he don't want
without being kicked around.

192
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,159
We're playing pool. Take off.

193
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,878
- You want busted head, Maggio?
- No.

194
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:26,190
Then keep your big nose out altogether.

195
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,589
Training starts next week.
Pick up your stuff...

196
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,275
Look, I told Holmes and I'm telling you...

197
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,276
...I ain't fighting. I quit fighting!

198
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,515
You guys want to put the screws on,
go right ahead.

199
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,830
I can take anything you can dish out.

200
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,399
Okay, Prewitt.

201
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,794
Thanks.

202
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,150
I just hate to see a good guy
get it in the gut.

203
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,832
You'd better get used to it, kid.

204
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,957
You'll probably see a lot of it
before you die.

205
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,519
You don't scare easy, do you, Prewitt?

206
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,514
You know anything in Army regulation
says I got to box?

207
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,473
Every boxer in this outfis a non-com.

208
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,514
I guess you've never seen
a bunch of them get together...

209
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,953
...and give a man "The Treatment."

210
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,388
What do you mean "chick"? She's 45.

211
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,879
She's still too young for you.

212
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,236
I'm a better man than you any day
and don't forget it.

213
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,309
I won't forget it.

214
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,716
Whas the deal with him, anyway?

215
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,398
With Warden. I don't figure him.

216
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,028
Warden?

217
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,396
He ain't like the others.

218
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,516
He'll make it tough on you.

219
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,912
But he'll draw himself a line he thinks fair,
and he won't come over it.

220
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,998
You don't see many top kicks
like him no more.

221
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,149
He was with the 15th in Shanghai
when they saw their action.

222
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,515
I heard about it
down in the Philippines, even.

223
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,637
All I know is,
he's the best soldier I ever saw.

224
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,157
Count cadence, count!

225
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,755
One, two, three, four.

226
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,637
Prewitt! Get in step!

227
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,998
Hut! Hut!

228
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,200
Prewitt, this is a drill, not a picnic!
Get in step!

229
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,840
Hut! Hut! Hut!

230
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,995
Halt!

231
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,234
Left face!

232
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,071
Prewitt! One step forward. March!

233
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,276
You march like a drunken gooney bird.
I got to teach you how to drill. Stay here.

234
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,920
Platoon, dismissed!

235
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,908
Detail, right face!

236
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,470
Detail, forward march!

237
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,550
Half left march!

238
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,552
Half right march!

239
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,715
Assemble your weapons.

240
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,198
All right, start.

241
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,593
A rifle's your best friend.

242
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,996
In the case it jams in combat,
could mean life or death.

243
00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:00,119
You got to learn to strip them down
and put them back together, blindfolded.

244
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,918
Your rear sighs way off!

245
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,634
You'd be 50 feet off-target at 300 yards.

246
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,230
Thas what happens when a soldier
don't know how to assemble his rifle.

247
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,393
Seven laps around the track, double time.
Keep the rifle at high port!

248
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,151
Wide open, huh, Prewitt?

249
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,954
Maybe seven more laps
will teach you to watch yourself.

250
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:06,952
Are you crazy? I saw what you did.

251
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,114
Nothing but trouble.
Better keep your mind off her.

252
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,158
What do you wanna do,
wind up in Leavenworth?

253
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,198
I won't be back in time to take retreat.
Or reveille, either.

254
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,351
All work and no play, Sergeant.

255
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,632
All you do is sit around
sweating over papers.

256
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,029
There are other things in the world
beside work.

257
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,111
You ought to get out
more yourself, Warden.

258
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,475
I've been considering it.

259
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,075
Well, I'm going.
I'm leaving it in your care, Sergeant.

260
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,834
Ill be here when you get back, sir.

261
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,598
Well, if it isn't Sergeant Warden.

262
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,558
You'd better step inside or you'll get wet.

263
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,354
I am wet.

264
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,117
If you're looking for the Captain,
he isn't here.

265
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,396
And if I'm not looking for him?

266
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,958
He still isn't here.

267
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,713
I'm looking for him.
You know where he is?

268
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,879
I haven't the slightest idea.
Perhaps he's in town on business.

269
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,158
Thas the way you put it
the other day, isn't it?

270
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,471
I got some papers
is important for him to sign.

271
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,711
I'll try phoning him at the club.

272
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:20,109
- Maybe he's there.
- Don't do that.

273
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,033
I never like to disturb a man
when he's drinking.

274
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,630
I could use a drink myself.

275
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,316
Do you wanna ask me in?

276
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,718
The liquor's there, Sergeant.
In the cabinet.

277
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,555
You're taking an awful chance, you know.

278
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,279
My maid is liable to be home anytime.

279
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,838
No, she won't. Thursday's her day off.

280
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,917
You think of everything, don't you?

281
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,639
I try. In my position, you have to.

282
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,119
Are these really important?

283
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,829
Yes. But not important
they get signed today. Tomorrow's okay.

284
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,558
I got copies at the office.

285
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,313
So it won't be much work to fix them up.

286
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,432
Thas what I like about you, Sergeant.
You have confidence.

287
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,476
Is also what I dislike about you.

288
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,198
Is not confidence, ma'am.

289
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,713
Is honesty.

290
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,360
I hate to see a beautiful woman
going to waste.

291
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,118
"Waste" did you say?

292
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,236
There's a subject
I might tell you something about.

293
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,360
I know several kinds of waste, Sergeant.

294
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,477
You're probably not even remotely aware
of some of them.

295
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,471
Would you like to hear?

296
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,917
For instance,
what about the house without a child?

297
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,991
There's one sort for you.

298
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,751
Then there's another...

299
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,190
you're doing fine, Sergeant.

300
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,518
My husbanïs off somewhere,
is raining and we're both drinking now.

301
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,670
You've probably only got one thing wrong:

302
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,512
The lady herself.

303
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,990
The lady's not what she seems.

304
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,199
She's a washout,
if you know what I mean...

305
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,074
...and I'm sure you know what I mean.

306
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,079
You gonna cry?

307
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,757
Not if I can help it.

308
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,238
What are you doing?

309
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,953
I'm leaving. Isn't that what you want?

310
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,437
I don't know, Sergeant.

311
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,632
I don't know.

312
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,517
- Speed it up.
- I'm speeding.

313
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,919
"Payday"

314
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,750
All right, Maggio. You wanna get paid?
Knock it off.

315
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,834
Angelo! A dollar he's wrong, coming up.

316
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,075
Sorry, I already won my bankroll
in the latrine.

317
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,469
Besides, is a penny-ante game.

318
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,353
Come on, buddy boy, we're going to town.

319
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,676
Look, don't let them get your goat.

320
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,877
We dress up in civvies
and we're as good as the rest of the world.

321
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,151
Here, wear this.

322
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,515
My sister sent it to me.

323
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,830
She buys everything too big.

324
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,791
Look, first we hit a few bars, see?

325
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,917
Then we go to a place where I'm
a member: The New Congress Club.

326
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,713
Girls!

327
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,518
Any prejudices against girls?

328
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,231
Thas what I thought.

329
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,919
Well, it looks like you're all primed
for a big night.

330
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,115
Hello, Stark.

331
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,714
- You want some company?
- No, thanks. All tied up.

332
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,629
Leva says you've been eyeing the Captain's
wife like a hound at hunting.

333
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,393
He has, huh?
What else did that character tell you?

334
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,870
She took up with a lot of men
back at Fort Bliss.

335
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,428
I wouldn't put stock in stories like that.

336
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,238
This ain't no story.

337
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,875
Because I was one of them myself.

338
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,439
Not for long, though.

339
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,670
Sure is something strange
about that woman.

340
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,671
Yeah. Thanks for the tip.

341
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,314
See you.

342
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,829
Hello.

343
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:23,189
- I didn't think you were coming.
- Why not? I ain't late.

344
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,158
No, I guess you're not.

345
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,158
But I got here a little early.
I must have been over-anxious.

346
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,949
- You weren't, though, were you?
- I stopped along the way for a few drinks.

347
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,996
You chose a lovely spot for our meeting.

348
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,674
I've had three chances to be picked up
in five minutes.

349
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,637
Thas par for the course around here.

350
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,756
Well, I don't care for it.

351
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,076
I never went in much for back-alley loving.

352
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,593
Take it easy.

353
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,397
You probably think I'm a tramp.

354
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,192
What makes you think
I'd think a thing like that?

355
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,554
Don't try to be gallant.

356
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,269
If you think this is a mistake,
come right out and say so.

357
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,753
Well, I guess is about time for me
to be getting home, isn't it?

358
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,235
Isn't it?

359
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,834
Whas the matter?
What started all this, anyway?

360
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,275
You think I'd be here
if I thought it was a mistake?

361
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,592
Risking 20 years in Leavenworth
for a date with the Commander's wife?

362
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,593
And her acting like Lady Astor's horse,
and all because I got here on time!

363
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,639
On the other hand,
I've got a bathing suit under my dress.

364
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,668
Me, too.

365
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,513
Why, is Angelo Maggio.

366
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,511
Greetings, Mrs. Kipfer.

367
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,158
There you are, sweetie-pie.
Dues all paid up.

368
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,989
Who you got playing the piano, a hippo?

369
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,071
Angelo, I don't think I've met your friend.

370
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,116
Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

371
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,953
You know how I hate it
when you boys are in this condition.

372
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,029
You see that, buddy boy?

373
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,157
A woman sees a soldier and, like that,
she figures he's drunk.

374
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,754
- You know why?
- Because he is.

375
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,191
Heavy drinking simply doesn't mix
with the entertainment business.

376
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,350
A respectable place
must consider its future.

377
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,797
Mrs. Kipfer, you have my solemn word
your future will be safe with us.

378
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,150
Angelo is one of my favourites.

379
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,398
Annette, dear, take care of this gentleman
for me, will you, please?

380
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,075
Thall be $4, babyface.

381
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,432
$2 for initiation fee,
$2 for this month's dues.

382
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,555
What do I get for it?

383
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,796
Entitlement to all privileges of the club:

384
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,229
Dancing, snack bar, soft drink bar.

385
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,629
Gentlemanly relaxation
with the opposite gender.

386
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,399
So long as they are gentlemen.
No liquor is permitted.

387
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,276
Got it?

388
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,713
I've got it.

389
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,791
Girls, here's some new poison.

390
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,558
This is Billie, Jean and Nancy.

391
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,398
- Nice meeting you.
- Hi, there.

392
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,958
Don't tell me the princess is your style.

393
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,870
This is Suzanne and Roxanne.

394
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,115
Hello, there.

395
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,919
- Would you like to dance, honey?
- Hey!

396
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,472
Much as I adore your company...

397
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,955
...I hope I may be allowed
to tear myself away.

398
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,678
I just saw a few friends at the door.

399
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,435
I can also see that I will be
of no further use to you.

400
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,677
Hi. You busy?

401
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,919
Whas your name?

402
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,114
I'm Lorene.

403
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,954
Lorene?

404
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,352
I haven't seen you in here before.

405
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,358
I haven't been in here before.

406
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,269
My friend brought me.
He and I are stationed out at Schofield.

407
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,516
I didn't think you were a soldier.

408
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,352
What do you mean?

409
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,188
- Well, l...
- I'm a 30-year man, in for the whole ride.

410
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:07,438
I suppose is different
when a fellow makes a career of it.

411
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,751
Nothing wrong with a soldier
that isn't wrong with everyone else.

412
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,236
I like you just the same.

413
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,875
I liked you the minute
I saw Annette bring you in.

414
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,195
You did?

415
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,155
Is funny, I came in and stood there
and saw you sitting over here.

416
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,834
Knock it off, buddy.
Put a mute in that thing.

417
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,798
I'll play as loud as I want, you little wop!

418
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,949
"Little wop"?

419
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,956
Mess with me, fatstuff, I'll bust you up.

420
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:34,759
You must be in a hurry for trouble, wop.

421
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,192
- Wait right here for me, will you?
- Yeah, sure.

422
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,429
I will not have this.

423
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:44,399
- Mussolini's telling me how to play.
- Busting my eardrums with his noise!

424
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,913
- Les not be cruel.
- Break it up.

425
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,797
You'll have to go if you can't behave.

426
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,155
Only my friends call me "wop"!

427
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,797
- You know who that guy is?
- What do I care?

428
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,869
Who is he?

429
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,520
Fatso Judson.
Sergeant of the Guard at the stockade.

430
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,229
Let him alone.

431
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,755
I seen him nearly murder a guy once.
He likes it.

432
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,718
Okay, bullyboy, now you won the war.
Les dance, huh?

433
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,915
Yeah, we'll dance.

434
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,797
First I got to calm my nerves.

435
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,589
Les go to a phone booth
where I'll unveil a fifth of whisky...

436
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:17,558
...I have hidden here
under my loose-flowing sports shirt.

437
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,392
Don't get hurt, pal.

438
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,233
Your balance has got to be letter-perfect.

439
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,513
I thought you were gonna wait?

440
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,358
Bill was telling me about surfboarding.

441
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,429
Hello, friend.

442
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:40,154
Just sit down and listen.
He describes it thrillingly.

443
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,992
You know anything about surfboarding?

444
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,116
No, nothing. Not a thing.

445
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,596
You must be stationed inland.
At DeRussey I get lots of chances.

446
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,671
Yeah, but we got mountains.

447
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:52,473
- Know anything about mountain climbing?
- A little bit.

448
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,636
- You a mountain climber?
- No.

449
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,354
- Know about flying a plane?
- I've had a few lessons.

450
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,998
I can't fly, either.

451
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,833
What do you know about deepsea diving?

452
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,836
Bill, shall we move into another room?

453
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,197
Sure. The air in here seems
to have gotten lousy, hasn't it?

454
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:10,111
- I noticed that.
- Listen, fella.

455
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,872
Come on, les go.

456
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,757
How's the deepsea diver?

457
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,718
That was a terrible way you acted.

458
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,554
Maybe I was jealous.

459
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,789
You're a funny one.

460
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,193
What do you dames want?
To tease a man to death?

461
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,955
Mrs. Kipfer pays us to be nice
to all the boys.

462
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,873
They're all alike. Is it so important?

463
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,635
It is important.
We may seem all alike, we ain't all alike.

464
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,073
I'm sorry.

465
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,679
Look...

466
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,756
Les go sit up in Mrs. Kipfer's parlour.

467
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,071
She lets us use it sometimes
for somebody special.

468
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,718
I'll go ask her.

469
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,911
- Then you're not mad?
- No, I'm not mad.

470
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,152
Because if you're still mad,
I'd just rather we call the whole thing off.

471
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,230
You certainly are a funny one.

472
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,076
I never knew it could be like this.

473
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,989
Nobody ever kissed me the way you do.

474
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,675
Nobody?

475
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,757
No. Nobody.

476
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:55,955
Not even one? Out of all the men
you've been kissed by?

477
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,838
Now, thad take some figuring.

478
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,912
How many do you think there have been?

479
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,989
I wouldn't know.

480
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,317
- Can't you give me a rough estimate?
- Not without an adding machine.

481
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,197
Do you have
your adding machine with you?

482
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,952
I forgot to bring it.

483
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,838
Then I guess you won't find out, will you?

484
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,317
Maybe I already know.

485
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,032
Whas the matter?

486
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,389
What are you hinting at?

487
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,875
Why? Is there something to hint at?

488
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,392
Maybe there's been a long line
of beach parties.

489
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,669
You must be crazy.

490
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,988
Am I?

491
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,640
What about when you and Holmes
were back at Fort Bliss?

492
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,714
Did you ever hear
of a soldier named Stark?

493
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,313
Maylon Stark?

494
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,274
Why, yes.

495
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,795
"Why, yes."

496
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,956
You knew him, too, didn't you?

497
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,593
Didn't you?

498
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,078
I had to go and forget
you were like all the rest of them.

499
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,559
Only is true, ain't it?

500
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,153
Well, ain't it?

501
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,119
Why don't you tell me about it?

502
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,315
Tell me the story.

503
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,038
There's always a story.

504
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,513
You don't leave a person anything, do you?

505
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,514
Come back here, Sergeant.
I'll tell you the story.

506
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,436
You can take it back
to the barracks with you.

507
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:50,077
I'd only been married to Dana two years
when I found out he was cheating.

508
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,470
But by that time, I was pregnant.

509
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,790
I thought I had something to hope for.

510
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,838
I was almost happy
the night the pains began.

511
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,193
I remember
Dana was going to an officers' conference.

512
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,755
I told him to get home early,
to bring the doctor.

513
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,991
He might have, if his conference
hadn't been with a hatcheck girl.

514
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,520
He was drunk when he came in at 5:00 a.m.

515
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,716
I was lying on the floor.

516
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:17,391
I begged him to go for the doctor,
but he fell on the couch and passed out.

517
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,154
The baby was born about an hour later.

518
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,117
Of course it was dead.

519
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,674
It was a boy.

520
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,758
But they worked over me at the hospital,
fixed me up fine.

521
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,559
They even took my appendix out,
threw that in free.

522
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,675
Karen.

523
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,558
And one more thing: No more children.

524
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,039
Sure, I went out with men after that.
And if I'd ever found one that...

525
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,550
Karen, listen to me, listen.

526
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,074
I know.

527
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,510
Until I met you,
I didn't think it was possible either.

528
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,389
I enlisted too.

529
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,438
Came out here on my own
to get away from my hometown in Oregon.

530
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,914
How come?

531
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,152
I had a boyfriend.

532
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,717
I was a waitress, and he was
from the richest family in town.

533
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,678
He just married a girl
suitable for his position.

534
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,593
After three years of going around with me.

535
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:28,191
A pretty story, isn't it?
Maybe they could write a book about it.

536
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,430
They did. Thousands of them.

537
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,076
So I left and went to Seattle.

538
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,390
When I got there
I met a girl back from Hawaii.

539
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,471
She said she'd made a lot of money there.

540
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,278
So I caught the first boat.

541
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,835
I've been here a year and two months.

542
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,638
You don't like it very much, do you?

543
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,796
Oh, I don't like it. But I don't mind it.

544
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,876
Anyway, I won't be here forever.

545
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,349
No. Sure. I mean, why should you?

546
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,039
I got it all figured out.

547
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,596
In another year, I'll be back home,
with a stocking full of money.

548
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,114
And I'll be all set for life.

549
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,629
Who is it?

550
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,230
I didn't hear no sounds of combat,
so I thought you might want a drink.

551
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,197
You've been hogging the whisky, Angelo.

552
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,193
Not me, buddy. Is that Sandra.
She's a nice girl, but she drinks like a fish.

553
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,709
I hope there's a cop under that.

554
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,319
Keep pouring.

555
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,236
No, thanks. I don't drink.

556
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,515
I think is a weakness.

557
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,758
I grant you that.

558
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,515
I don't like weakness. Do you?

559
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,875
No, I don't like weakness.
But I like to drink.

560
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,271
What are you going to do, marry this guy?

561
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,590
You're grinning at him like you're his wife.

562
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,392
Get out of here!

563
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,996
Okay. I'm going.

564
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,470
Back to old long-legged Sandra.

565
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,028
I love them tall. Acres and acres.

566
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,031
Enjoy yourself, paisan.

567
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,594
You need this more than I do.

568
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,950
Tomorrow you'll be back
with "The Treatment."

569
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,112
What does he mean?

570
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,753
That was nice before.

571
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,751
The way you snuggled up in front of him.

572
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,592
Whas "The Treatment"?

573
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,116
Some of the guys putting me
over the jumps 'cause I don't want to fight.

574
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,030
Fight?

575
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,038
Yeah. On the boxing team.

576
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,759
I don't want to box.
I don't even want to think about it.

577
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,478
Why should you have to box?

578
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:43,909
Well, see, I used to fight, middleweight.

579
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,229
I was pretty good, and they know it.

580
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,639
Well, anyway...

581
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,358
Well, come on. Tell me. I want to hear.

582
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,350
Well, the thing is, see...

583
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,674
I used to work out with this guy,
Dixie Wells.

584
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,836
He's a real good friend of mine.

585
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,037
He loved to box.
People on the outside had their eye on him.

586
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,317
He was gonna come out of the Army
and go right up to the top.

587
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,192
Well, one afternoon...

588
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,396
...he and I were sparring in the gym.

589
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,914
You know, kind of friendly-like.

590
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,510
He must have been set pretty flat
on his feet...

591
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,592
...'cause I caught him...

592
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,310
...with a no-more-than-ordinary right cross.

593
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,318
He didn't get up. He didn't move.

594
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,950
He was in a coma for a week.

595
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,191
Finally, he did pull out of it.

596
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,236
Only, the thing was, he was blind.

597
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,269
I went to see him at the hospital
a couple of times.

598
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,630
Finally, I just couldn't go back.

599
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,349
The last time he and I started talking
about fighting and...

600
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,592
He started to cry.

601
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,112
Seeing tears coming out of those eyes
that couldn't see anything...

602
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:33,999
I thought I ought to tell you.

603
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,957
Holmes spoke to his boxers last night.

604
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,111
From now on, is no holds barred.

605
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,999
They aim to run you
right into the stockade if they got to.

606
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,308
Let them.

607
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,712
I'll help you as much as I can.

608
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,191
But I can't go too far out on a limb.

609
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,998
I ain't risking losing my stripes.

610
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,399
I like this outfit.

611
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,711
So do I. Thas funny, ain't it?

612
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,552
Yeah, that is funny.

613
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,951
Keep going in a straight line, Prewitt.

614
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,833
Keep going!

615
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,431
All right, thas enough.

616
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,796
Okay, Prewitt, bury it.

617
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,795
Time!

618
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,150
Clean up the mess, Prewitt.

619
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,836
Hurry it up.
You're on fatigue detail, not vacation.

620
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,833
Come on, clean it up!

621
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,237
Clean it up yourself!

622
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,029
What?

623
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,315
You heard me.
Rub your own nose in it a while.

624
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,790
Prewitt, you know better than talk back
to a non-commissioned officer.

625
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,118
Yes, sir, but I've never liked being spit on,
not even by a non-commissioned officer.

626
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,197
You owe Sergeant Galovitch an apology.

627
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,033
I don't think so.
Sergeant Galovitch owes me an apology.

628
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,599
Corporal Peluso?

629
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,638
Have this man roll a full field pack,
extra shoes and helmet.

630
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,439
Take a bicycle and hike him up
to Kole Kole Pass and back.

631
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,636
- Then bring him to me.
- Yes, sir.

632
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,358
All right, Prewitt, les go.

633
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,555
Time!

634
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,152
Hold it a minute.

635
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,477
Go ahead and have a cigarette.

636
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,516
I don't like this any more than you do.

637
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,794
Thanks.

638
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:02,629
I take it you're ready to apologise
to Sergeant Galovitch now?

639
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,438
No, sir, I'm not.

640
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,393
Peluso, take him up there again.

641
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,913
Yes, sir. All right, Prewitt, les go.

642
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,592
You can't be decent to a man like that.
You have to treat him like an animal.

643
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,391
Sergeant, prepare court-martial papers.

644
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,915
Insubordination
to a non-commissioned officer.

645
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,951
Yes, sir.

646
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,679
Only, is a shame.

647
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,749
What is?

648
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,513
I was thinking,
too bad you'll lose a good middleweight.

649
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,830
I don't care.
I don't have to tolerate such insolence.

650
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,876
No, sir, you sure don't.

651
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,435
I'll prepare the papers then.

652
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,919
Trouble is,
even if he gets just three months...

653
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,151
...he'll still be in the stockade
for the boxing finals.

654
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,993
Do you see any other way of breaking him?

655
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,075
You could double up
on company punishment, sir.

656
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,628
All right. I'll throw the book at him.

657
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,514
If you think thas the way to do it.

658
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,232
Nice going, Sarge.

659
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:39,951
Keep looking, you'll find yourself
scrubbing this orderly room floor!

660
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,553
Coming through! Watch it.

661
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,676
Me and my waiters
are working our tails off.

662
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,398
Hot! Hot! H-O-T!

663
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,274
How you doing, buddy boy?

664
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,636
Better than being thrown in the stockade,
ain't it?

665
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,588
How am I doing, Sarge? I'm a rough man.

666
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,875
Slow up a little, stop sweating in the food.

667
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,997
Don't hold me back, Sarge.
I'm putting in for corporal tomorrow.

668
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,115
You'll never make it.

669
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,031
- Hi, Sarge.
- Hi, Top.

670
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,876
Life in a rifle company.

671
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,476
You look awful tired, kid.

672
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,155
How do you like straight duty?

673
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,679
What makes you think I mind it?

674
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,398
I didn't say you minded it.

675
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:51,029
I just said you looked tired.
You know, drawn to a fine edge.

676
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,435
I like this life. Is a great life.

677
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,636
If I find a pearl, I'll cut you in.

678
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,438
Fifty-fifty. You know what I mean?

679
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,796
If you didn't put me here,
I'd have no chance to find it, right?

680
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,269
Now, there's a man for you.
What do you know?

681
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,432
Since you like it so much,
I'll see if I can find more for you.

682
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,511
How about garbage detail?

683
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,192
Thanks. I had that on Wednesday.

684
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,078
So, you did. What about street cleaning?

685
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,075
Yesterday.

686
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,196
You got a better memory than me.

687
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,032
Of course, if you were smart...

688
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,108
yeah, but I ain't smart.

689
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:24,317
I know. But if you were,
you wouldn't have to pull KP.

690
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,277
Or any other fatigue duty for that matter.

691
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:32,115
If you think you can bribe me into boxing,
Warden, you're wrong.

692
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,392
Not you and Dynamite Holmes
and "The Treatment."

693
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,476
How long are you guys gonna keep
breaking it off on that kid Prewitt?

694
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,593
You've had him on that extra duty roster
a month already.

695
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,478
- I can't see why you...
- Can't you, Pete?

696
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,952
Getting soft in your old age?
Maybe I want to teach him a lesson.

697
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,076
- Maybe you like it.
- Maybe I do.

698
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:59,511
I'm getting sick and tired
watching you being a stooge for Holmes.

699
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:03,995
You won't see it much longer.
I'm getting sick and tired of it myself.

700
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,878
I'm through, Pete.
Any day now. And I mean it.

701
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,118
Listen, if Holmes'd let me,
I'd transfer out of here tomorrow.

702
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,516
Half a dozen companies in this regiment
would grab me, in grade, too.

703
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,034
Oh, sure. I could be Chief of Staff, too.

704
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,588
Only I just can't think of leaving
my old buddies.

705
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,312
Where're you going, Little Sir Echo?

706
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:23,676
To take my shower, if the stinking
First Sergeant has no objections.

707
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,830
Where'd you think?
To the movies in this towel?

708
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,239
Hurry up. We'll get some beer.

709
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:30,118
I wouldn't drink with you
if it was the last beer on Earth.

710
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,553
I'm buying.

711
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,952
Thas different.

712
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,315
Do you know why I like
to have you serve me beer?

713
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,153
So as I can watch you
when you walk away.

714
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,674
Is in regulations.
You got a right to complain.

715
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,513
You've a right to take your case
to the Inspector General.

716
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,353
Any soldier has, even a plain dogface.

717
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,352
Nope. I ain't gonna complain.

718
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,638
They ain't going to get that satisfaction.

719
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,758
This soldier's got a real big family.
Fifteen of them.

720
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,637
'Course this is only half of them.

721
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,551
You see the gentleman
with the handlebars?

722
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:33,473
Thas Mr. Maggio.
Mr. Maggio is my father.

723
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,759
I never saw anyone so stubborn.

724
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,117
- How long since they let you go into town?
- Six weeks.

725
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,315
Liable to be six years.

726
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,709
How'd you like it?
Six years before you see a dame?

727
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,633
Look, why don't you just
mind your own business?

728
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,553
And why don't you learn to play the bugle?

729
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,914
Thas my buddy boy!

730
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:42,912
Who's the broad?

731
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,713
Is my sister.

732
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,429
You hit me!

733
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,273
Yeah, and I'm about to do it again, too.

734
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,798
Why, you dirty wop!

735
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,717
If you want to fight, take it outside!

736
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,279
I'll cut this wop's heart out.

737
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,352
Anybody steps in here,
I give it to him first.

738
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,992
One step further, Fatso,
and I'm going to de-brain you.

739
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:20,072
Nobody's doing nothing.
Anybody does any killing, I'll do it!

740
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,599
Is a private affair, Warden.

741
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,240
No, it isn't! This man's in my company!

742
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,558
And you ain't making two
extra weeks' paperwork for me for nothing.

743
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:29,874
Out for blood, huh?

744
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,837
You'd puke at the sight of a dead man.

745
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,354
Put down that stool. Put it down!

746
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,832
Drop that knife.

747
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,668
Okay, Fatso,
if is killing you want, come on.

748
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,278
Well, come on!

749
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,190
On the floor!

750
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,788
Killers, huh?

751
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,316
I'd trade the pair of you
for a good Camp Fire Girl!

752
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,758
Tough monkey.

753
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,677
Guys like you end up in the stockade
sooner or later.

754
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,753
Some day you'll walk in, I'll be waiting.

755
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,797
I'll show you a couple of things.

756
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,029
I'm going to get a breath of air.

757
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,591
I'm glad he stopped it.

758
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,192
He's a good man.

759
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,754
You keep it. Keep it for a souvenir.

760
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,115
Okay, I'll keep it.

761
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,150
You ain't enjoying life much, are you, kid?

762
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,435
Could you stand a weekend pass?

763
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,478
Could I...

764
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,635
What about Holmes?

765
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,239
Don't worry about Holmes.

766
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,550
He signs anything without reading it.

767
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,592
I sure could use it.

768
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,836
I hear you've gone dippy over some dame
down at the New Congress Club.

769
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:09,594
Whad you say her name was?

770
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,874
Lorene.

771
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,031
Is a beautiful name.

772
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,038
Hey, paisan!

773
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,351
Whas holding you up? Les get going.

774
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,796
Whas wrong? Don't you like it here?
Something better to do in town?

775
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,474
The bus is leaving right away.
I'm taking the bus.

776
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,472
Take off. You're talking to a rich man.
I'll hop a taxi.

777
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:43,551
I'll meet you at the Kalakaua, later.

778
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,391
Maggio. Get ready for guard.

779
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:59,235
Campaign hat, cartridge belt and weapon.
Report to the orderly room in 10 minutes.

780
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,958
What? I got a pass!

781
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,714
Not anymore.
Anderson's sick. You're on guard.

782
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,791
I just had guard yesterday. Why me?

783
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,310
I'll tell you why, you.
You should have gotten dressed faster.

784
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,558
I sure never figured
on your giving me the runaround.

785
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,358
They didn't even want to let me in.

786
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:22,509
We're mobbed, thas why.

787
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,989
A big crowd from Hickam Field
got in here first.

788
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:27,389
- Did you expect a brass band to meet you?
- No.

789
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,754
Thought you'd want to see me.

790
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,193
I'm busy, can't you see? Look.

791
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:31,474
Yes, I see is crowded.

792
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,595
Well, I am.

793
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,593
Maggio's going to be
at the Kalakaua Inn later.

794
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,637
Is there no way you can get out of here?

795
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,039
Whas the matter with you?

796
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,712
I work here, you know, after all.

797
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,028
Can't you understand?

798
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,829
Yes, I do. I understand.
I understand very well.

799
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,712
You haven't been here in weeks.
Now you turn up all of a sudden...

800
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,030
Watch it, Mack!
Watch where you're going!

801
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:59,872
Come on out of here.

802
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,753
Don't you think Mrs. Kipfer has rules?
I can't just walk out.

803
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,673
- Even if I could, she doesn't like us...
- All right, look.

804
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,354
If you feel that way,
just forget about it, okay?

805
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,271
You haven't any claims on me, mister.

806
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,918
You're not my husband, you know.

807
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,069
There you are.

808
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:25,072
I vastly admire your taste,
but we really need Lorene now.

809
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,912
So many gentlemen are unattended.

810
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,558
- It is such a rush, isn't it?
- Yeah.

811
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,110
Almost like one of those big
political conventions in Philadelphia.

812
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,519
You are coming, Lorene?

813
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,033
In a minute.

814
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:38,749
I'm sorry.

815
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:43,393
How do you think I feel?
I may not get another pass for months.

816
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:47,310
I've been counting on this
like a kid counts on Christmas.

817
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:50,114
But forget it.

818
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,555
Lorene's busy, she's got work to do.
Lorene's sorry.

819
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,551
Stop calling me Lorene! My name's Alma!

820
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,392
- Alma?
- Yes, Alma Burke!

821
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,715
Alma?

822
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,156
Mrs. Kipfer picked Lorene
out of a perfume ad.

823
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,510
She thought it sounded French.

824
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:27,559
Hey, how did you get away?

825
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,717
I told Mrs. Kipfer I was sick.

826
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:32,559
- But I bet she doesn't believe it.
- I bet she doesn't.

827
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,234
- Whall you have?
- A Coke, please.

828
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,436
Give her a big Coke.

829
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:39,318
Is great you meeting me here.

830
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,437
You know, I'm just lucky getting in town.

831
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,748
Top Kick gave me a break.

832
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,473
They still pouring it on?

833
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,358
Holmes and those others,
they really got me on the edge.

834
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:51,716
- You must hate the Army.
- No, I don't hate the Army.

835
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,718
But look what is doing to you.

836
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:55,714
I love the Army.

837
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,435
But it sure doesn't love you.

838
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:04,273
A man loves a thing,
that don't mean is got to love him back.

839
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,830
Yeah, but a person can stand just so much.

840
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:11,598
You love a thing, you've got to be grateful.

841
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:13,558
I left home when I was 17.

842
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,238
Both my folks is dead.

843
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,756
I didn't belong no place
till I entered the Army.

844
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,951
Thas where I learned to bugle.

845
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,669
To bugle?

846
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,197
Thas the mouthpiece I used
when I played a taps at Arlington.

847
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,870
They picked me to play a taps
at Arlington Cemetery on Armistice Day.

848
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,036
The President was there.

849
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,791
I play the bugle well.

850
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,672
Hello, citizens!

851
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:44,793
Hey, where you been?

852
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,595
Hi, pals. I've been in three bars
and I put a dent in all three of them.

853
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,039
Yeah, you look it.

854
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:51,991
Give me a nail. I'm hungry for a nail.

855
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,718
What you doing in uniform?

856
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,189
I'm thinking of joining the Army.

857
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:59,718
Or maybe I'll go to Mexico
and become a cowboy.

858
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:00,994
You want to go with me?

859
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:05,079
You keep on drinking,
you'll be as much use as a melted candle.

860
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:09,753
You're absolutely right.
Bartender! Large whisky.

861
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,031
Excuse me. Hey, buddy.

862
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,789
Sam!

863
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,834
Hey, coming out, fellas,
the terror of Gimbels' basement.

864
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,388
Stand back. Here we go.

865
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,118
A seven for Daddy, five deuce.

866
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,554
Seven.

867
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,952
Snake eyes.

868
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,719
The story of my life.

869
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:38,151
Prew, thas the Royal Hawaiian Hotel
around the corner...

870
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,310
...where all those movie stars stay.

871
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,232
Paisan, you'd better simmer down.

872
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,470
You got a whole weekend ahead of you.

873
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,312
Thas what you say, buddy.

874
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,914
What do you mean?
They only gave you an overnight pass?

875
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:49,989
No pass.

876
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,037
No pass. They put me on guard duty.

877
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,156
But old Angelo, he foxed them.

878
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,272
You walked off guard?

879
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,834
I checked in and I checked right out again.

880
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:02,879
Get your tail right back to the post.
You're in trouble, you know that.

881
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,276
I got a good idea. Les go swimming!

882
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,511
We'll go swimming with a movie star.
Thas what I'm gonna do.

883
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:09,789
Listen, Angelo.

884
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,549
Twenty feet tall,
I'm going swimming with a movie star.

885
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,792
You'd better go.

886
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,719
Hey, Angelo.

887
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,589
You jerk, get up. Wake up.

888
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,910
I'm awake. What are you hollering about?

889
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,991
Yeah, you're awake. Put your clothes on.

890
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:41,231
Give them back to the Indians.
They need the clothes.

891
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,351
All they wear is G-strings.

892
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,234
You ain't drunk. Come on, get up.

893
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:53,069
I am waiting here for a movie star
to come out of the hotel.

894
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,754
I'm not going until she shows up.

895
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:58,032
Put your clothes on.

896
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,958
Les get out of here
before we get in trouble. Okay?

897
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,559
Whas the matter with you?

898
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,477
Can't a man get drunk?

899
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,711
Can't a man do nothing?

900
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:12,672
Can't he put his lousy hands
in his lousy pockets on a lousy street?

901
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,274
A man gotta be hounded all his life?

902
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,836
I'm tired. I ain't no criminal.

903
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,594
I ain't no coward!

904
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,318
Buddy boy, look...

905
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,714
Get dressed, put your clothes on.

906
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,999
- Wait for me? I'll get a cab.
- Yeah, sure.

907
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,355
- Will you wait?
- You get a cab.

908
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,357
Hey, MPs! Come and get me, you guys!

909
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,953
Here I am!

910
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,558
Is that the best you can do?

911
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,790
I bet you guys eat Wheaties!

912
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,676
Any word on Maggio's court-martial yet?

913
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,393
Is on right now.

914
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,039
He'll get the stockade sure.

915
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:19,471
Maybe he won't get it.

916
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,513
All he did was to get drunk.

917
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:25,510
Is a soldier's nature.
Is almost a sacred duty once in a while.

918
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:27,398
But he walked off guard. He went AWOL.

919
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,118
What are you hanging around here for?

920
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,349
Can't a man rest a minute?

921
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:33,352
What man? You got no work?
Maybe I can scare you up some.

922
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,679
Go shoot some pool.
Any word comes, I'll let you know.

923
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,912
Company G,
First Sergeant Warden speaking. Yes, sir.

924
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,031
Yes, sir, I'll have his things in order.

925
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,511
He got it. Six months.

926
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:16,753
I'm gonna escape from this dump.

927
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:19,479
Gimbels' basement couldn't hold me,
neither can this.

928
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,790
- Shut up!
- Whatever you say, Brownie.

929
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,672
Prisoner! Halt!

930
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,472
Hello, tough monkey.

931
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,755
This other girl and I were lucky to rent it.
This is a very fashionable district.

932
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,711
I have another key made for you.

933
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:09,594
You can use it any time you want to,
even when I'm not here.

934
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,433
- Hi.
- Hi.

935
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,230
This is Prew, the soldier I told you about.

936
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,233
- This is Georgette, my roommate.
- Well, welcome, friend.

937
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,914
Hasn't been a man around the house
since the cat died.

938
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:31,712
I belong to the Book Guild Club.
I always take every book.

939
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:33,552
Thas the way I get all the dividends.

940
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,751
She'll be great for your friend
when he gets out of the stockade.

941
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,070
Yes, he'll be crazy about her.

942
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,394
Just sit down and get comfortable.

943
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:50,109
I'll make you a martini
and see whas to cook for dinner.

944
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:53,155
This is like being married, ain't it?

945
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,639
Is better.

946
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,599
You okay?

947
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:38,198
Glad you came?

948
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:09,513
Les get out of here. Don't look around.

949
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:45,874
It can't go on like this much longer.

950
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,876
Even though we sneaked across
the island...

951
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:53,555
...we had to run out like jailbirds.

952
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,875
If there was only some way we...

953
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:06,955
Holmes'd probably give you a divorce,
but never let me transfer out of his outfit.

954
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,633
There is a way.

955
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:13,037
I've been thinking about it.

956
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:14,753
You've got to become an officer.

957
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,870
You can take the new extension course,
the one they passed last May.

958
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,236
- Once commissioned you go to the States.
- An officer?

959
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:26,230
Yes. Then I could divorce Dana
and marry you.

960
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,319
I hate officers. I've always hated officers!

961
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:32,558
Well, thas a fine, intelligent point of view.

962
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,553
Suppose I said I always hated sergeants.
Thad make a lot of sense, wouldn't it?

963
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:40,158
You sure made a complete study of it.

964
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,116
Okay, suppose I did it.
And don't think is a cinch.

965
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:48,551
You'd be here, I'd be in the States,
we'd be apart six months!

966
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,313
- We're sure to be into a war...
- Tell the truth.

967
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:55,279
You don't want the responsibility.
You're probably not even in love with me.

968
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:57,669
You're crazy! I wish I didn't love you.

969
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,273
Maybe I could enjoy life again.

970
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:09,956
So they were married
and lived unhappily ever after.

971
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:15,599
I've never been so miserable in my life
as I have since I met you.

972
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,433
Neither have I.

973
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,917
- I wouldn't trade a minute of it.
- Neither would I.

974
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:27,791
I'll probably make the lousiest officer
in this man's Army you ever saw.

975
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:30,350
You'll make a fine officer.

976
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,991
A remarkable officer.

977
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,873
Thank you.

978
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:43,718
Come here.

979
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,754
Can't you wait until we finish dinner?

980
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,514
Honey...

981
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,439
...I want to marry you.

982
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,073
You're a funny one.

983
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:03,033
Why's it funny if a guy
wants to marry you?

984
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,313
Because I'm a girl you met
at the New Congress Club.

985
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,675
Thas about two steps
up from the pavement.

986
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,309
Well, what am I?
I'm a private, no-class dogface.

987
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:17,679
The way most civilians look at that,
thas two steps up from nothing.

988
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,350
Prew, I thought we were happy.

989
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:23,312
Why do you want to spoil things?

990
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:26,517
Look, I've got a year to go
before I re-enlist.

991
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:31,159
If I can swing sergeans stripes by then,
they'll let me go back to the States.

992
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:32,434
We can go back together...

993
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:34,113
...if you'll wait.

994
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,192
How do you expect to become a sergeant
under Captain Holmes?

995
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,555
Is all you can do
to keep out of the stockade.

996
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:44,273
I'll fight.

997
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,669
You're not gonna fight.

998
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,034
Id be worth it.

999
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,798
Prew, is true we love each other now.

1000
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,672
We need each other.

1001
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,553
But back in the States
it might be different.

1002
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,476
That ain't the real reason.

1003
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:10,392
- All right, is not.
- What is the real reason?

1004
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:16,798
I won't marry you because
I don't want to be the wife of a soldier.

1005
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:25,071
Well, that would be about the best
I could ever do for you.

1006
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,154
Because nobody's going to stop me
from my plan. Nobody, nothing.

1007
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:34,112
Because I want to be proper.

1008
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,429
"Proper"?

1009
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:37,079
Yes, proper.

1010
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:40,959
In another year,
I'll have enough money saved.

1011
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:42,911
I'll go back to my hometown in Oregon.

1012
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,514
I'll build a house for my mother and myself.

1013
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,160
Join the country club and take up golf.

1014
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,755
I'll meet the proper man
with the proper position.

1015
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,470
I'll make a proper wife
who can run a proper home.

1016
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,437
Raise proper children.

1017
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:02,036
I'll be happy because when you're proper,
you're safe.

1018
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,952
You got guts, honey.

1019
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:09,150
I hope you can pull it off.

1020
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:20,799
I do mean it when I say I need you,
'cause I'm lonely.

1021
01:13:23,240 --> 01:13:24,798
You think I'm lying, don't you?

1022
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,594
Nobody ever lies about being lonely.

1023
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:39,431
And don't talk to me about a divorce.

1024
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:43,672
Why? Because the scandal
would spoil your chances for a promotion?

1025
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,076
I ask you once more: I want to know
who he is and where you met him.

1026
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:48,798
I'm not going to tell you.

1027
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,599
One thing I know: I know he's a civilian.

1028
01:13:52,680 --> 01:13:54,955
You'd be too discreet to pick an Army man.

1029
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,078
I wonder which is hurt more,
your pride or your curiosity?

1030
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:00,151
You can't know how I feel about this.

1031
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,358
I wonder why men feel so differently
about it than women?

1032
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,831
Is just not the same.

1033
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,432
Is a lovely day. I think I'll go for a walk.

1034
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,753
I hear you just got out of the stockade.

1035
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,358
It was rugged.
Kept my mouth shut, didn't get in trouble.

1036
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,238
Did you see Maggio?

1037
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:32,108
Fatso's really got it in for Maggio.
He's using a billy, too.

1038
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:36,195
In places where it won't show.
On the back, on the chest.

1039
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,158
He's got it down to a system.

1040
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,196
He kicks him a lot, too.

1041
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:42,951
You know how Maggio's taking it?

1042
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:46,079
He just keeps spitting in Fatso's eye.

1043
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,518
Ain't he a hot one?

1044
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,751
Well, he's a good man.

1045
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:55,435
Fatso can't make a dent in him.

1046
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:59,953
But, that Fatso, he's smart. He makes sure
the O.D. Never sees nothing.

1047
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,877
Why don't Maggio go to the O.D. Himself?

1048
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,110
We tried to get him to, but he won't peep.

1049
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,236
That boy's the toughest nut in the woods.

1050
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:09,319
You think he's going to be all right?

1051
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:10,913
Well, maybe he's cracking, at that.

1052
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:11,989
What do you mean?

1053
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,591
After Fatso threw him in the Hole...
Thas solitary...

1054
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:19,190
...he started talking a couple of times
about how he's gonna escape.

1055
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,794
He said to tell you
he'll look you up one night.

1056
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,151
Still on your knees, Prewitt?

1057
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:29,871
Boxing finals next month: December 15.

1058
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:33,396
You've still got time to help us
win the championship.

1059
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,076
Are you proud to be in this company
or not?

1060
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:47,396
I ain't gonna move around you again.

1061
01:15:47,640 --> 01:15:50,200
Something tells me you need a lesson.

1062
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,151
Maybe I'll give it to you myself.

1063
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:58,511
Leave him alone. He's in my detail.

1064
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,478
You'll get in trouble if you fight here.
Get back to work.

1065
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,278
Get out of my way!

1066
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:34,191
I'll be glad to recommend you.

1067
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:36,476
You've got service, experience, grade.

1068
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:39,074
- You'll make an excellent officer.
- Thank you, sir.

1069
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:42,675
Id be a feather in my cap, too.
A man from my company.

1070
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:46,237
At ease. Whas the trouble, Sergeant?

1071
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:49,312
They're fighting outside, sir.
Galovitch and Prewitt.

1072
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,355
Prewitt?

1073
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,954
Galovitch looks like
he's going to murder him.

1074
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,837
I'll take care of it.

1075
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,233
Don't you want to see?

1076
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,959
No! Nor you, either! Get out of here!

1077
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,113
Why don't Prew go for his head?

1078
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,634
Blinded a guy once.
Must be scared of the same thing.

1079
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,478
The face, Prew! Hit him in the face!

1080
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:44,713
Come on, Galovitch, fight fair!

1081
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:46,193
I'll fight any way I want.

1082
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:49,751
Come on, Prew, get up!

1083
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,349
Why doesn't that officer stop that fight?

1084
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,068
- Whas his name, Major?
- Captain Holmes, sir.

1085
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:55,916
At ease. What started this?

1086
01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:00,039
Prewitt refused an order I gave him.
Talked back and started a fight.

1087
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:01,275
I taught him a lesson.

1088
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,277
You won't disobey orders in my company.

1089
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,954
Sir, I'm sorry,
but Private Prewis not to blame.

1090
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:09,031
Sergeant Galovitch started it.

1091
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:10,473
- Thornhill?
- Yes, sir.

1092
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:12,835
You're in charge of this detail.
What about it?

1093
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,439
He's right, Prewitt did nothing.

1094
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:16,829
Yes, sir. Galovitch started it.

1095
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:19,476
Thas all. Les forget it.

1096
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:21,670
Les get back to our jobs.

1097
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,277
If you guys think this means
I'll step into a ring, you're wrong.

1098
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,994
You'd better put some iodine on them cuts.

1099
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,039
Hey, Friday.

1100
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,039
Why are you called "Friday"?

1101
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,918
I don't know. I was born on a Wednesday.

1102
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:30,751
Hey, Prewitt, where you going?

1103
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,029
Where am I going?

1104
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:35,476
I'm going to Choy's.
I'm gonna get me another beer.

1105
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,069
Halt!

1106
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,718
Who goes there?

1107
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:55,349
A friend.

1108
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:57,790
Advance, friend, and be recognised!

1109
01:22:07,240 --> 01:22:08,753
Ten-hut!

1110
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,799
About face!

1111
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,154
Rear face!

1112
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:13,355
On your knees!

1113
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,158
Scrub the floor!

1114
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:17,039
At ease.

1115
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,669
Hello, kid.

1116
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,513
What you doing out here all by yourself?

1117
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,238
I'm gonna get a little drink.

1118
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:29,311
Sit down. I got a bottle.

1119
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,759
Thanks, Top.

1120
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,279
I got to hand it to you, kid...

1121
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:43,477
...the way you beat up
old Galovitch this afternoon.

1122
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,433
Too bad they gotta get you sooner or later.

1123
01:22:54,120 --> 01:22:56,554
Life's crummy, you know it?

1124
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:59,918
Yes, sir, is perfectly miserable.

1125
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:06,157
What do you suppose would happen
if a truck came along and ran us over?

1126
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,598
We'd be dead.

1127
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:10,394
Better not sit here anymore.

1128
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:13,631
You'd better get up
and sit over on the side of the road.

1129
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:15,517
What do you mean, I better?

1130
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,750
You've got more to live for than I do.

1131
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,910
You got your whole company
to take care of.

1132
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,434
You move over
to the other side of the road.

1133
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,829
I'm old and it don't matter if I die.

1134
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:27,673
You got your whole life ahead of you.
Don't argue. Get up.

1135
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,034
No, sir, not Prewitt.

1136
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,998
Prewitt stays right here to the bitter end.

1137
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:37,234
Okay, we'll stay together.

1138
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,917
I couldn't have got up anyway.

1139
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:50,917
I got the biggest troubles
in the whole world.

1140
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:54,116
In the whole world, huh?

1141
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,673
Take love.

1142
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:59,397
Did you personally ever see
any of this love?

1143
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,190
You'll understand what I mean.

1144
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:04,032
This girl...

1145
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,990
...she wants me to become...

1146
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:09,557
- Become what?
- An officer.

1147
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,195
Can you see me as an officer?

1148
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:15,834
Yeah, I can see you as an officer.

1149
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,154
You'd be a good officer.

1150
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:20,038
Well, you both can see
more than I can see.

1151
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:23,391
I don't wanna be an officer.
I'm happy where I am.

1152
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,948
I might turn out to be a guy like Holmes.

1153
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:32,393
You wouldn't want me
to be a guy like Holmes, would you?

1154
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,872
Well, would you?

1155
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,470
A man should be what he can do.

1156
01:24:49,520 --> 01:24:51,238
How's your girl?

1157
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,997
Whas her name again?

1158
01:24:56,120 --> 01:24:57,030
Lorene.

1159
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:58,314
Oh, yeah.

1160
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,918
I remember now.

1161
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,352
A beautiful name.

1162
01:25:04,240 --> 01:25:05,514
Beautiful.

1163
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,316
You two dumb, crazy screwballs.

1164
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:15,675
What are you trying to do,
get yourself killed?

1165
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,432
Why are you in the middle of the road?

1166
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,637
My friend Prew and I,
we're sitting here discussing the weather.

1167
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,836
- Your friend, huh?
- You heard me.

1168
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:25,275
Don't you know
you gotta take care of this man?

1169
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,353
Holmes is bound to get him
sooner or later.

1170
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:31,280
And he's the best stinking soldier
in the whole Army.

1171
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,749
You both got rocks in your head.

1172
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,433
Angelo.

1173
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:45,594
I figured you'd be here at Choy's.

1174
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:48,868
I done it, Prew.

1175
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:51,196
I escaped just like I said.

1176
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:53,271
Just like I figured...

1177
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,874
...in a back of a truck, under a tarp.

1178
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:57,918
They rode me right out.

1179
01:25:58,000 --> 01:25:59,718
Just like I figured.

1180
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,677
Only the tailgate opened up, Prew,
about a mile back...

1181
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,910
...and I fell out in the road.

1182
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,836
You shoulïve seen me bounce.

1183
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,956
I musve broke something.

1184
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:18,239
Prew, listen.

1185
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,036
Fatso done it, Prew.

1186
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:23,156
He likes to whack me in the gut.

1187
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:25,436
He asks me if it hurts...

1188
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,750
...and I spit at him like always.

1189
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:31,238
Only yesterday, it was bad.

1190
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:33,039
He hit me...

1191
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:34,679
...he hit me...

1192
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:36,113
...he hit me.

1193
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:40,312
I had to get out, Prew.

1194
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,631
- They gonna send you to the stockade?
- No, they ain't.

1195
01:26:45,720 --> 01:26:47,119
Watch out for Fatso.

1196
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,552
He'll try to crack you.

1197
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,790
If they put you in the Hole...

1198
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,433
...don't yell.

1199
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,437
Don't make a sound.

1200
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,549
You'll still be yelling
when they come to take you out.

1201
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,512
Just lay there.

1202
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:08,113
Just lay there and be quiet, Prew.

1203
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,119
He's dead.

1204
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:54,676
I'll bet you thas Prew.

1205
01:30:11,320 --> 01:30:12,912
Sergeant Judson?

1206
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:15,199
You want me?

1207
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,279
Yeah, Fatso.

1208
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:21,999
I don't like that nickname.
You want to see me about something?

1209
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:25,877
Les step around the corner
where we can talk.

1210
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:27,629
Okay.

1211
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:40,032
Are you sore about something?

1212
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:43,393
I don't like the way you play the piano.

1213
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:46,519
Remember Maggio?

1214
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,234
The wop? Yeah, real tough monkey.

1215
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:51,551
- You killed him.
- Did I?

1216
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:53,838
Well, if I did, he asked for it.

1217
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:57,597
The Army's going to get you
sooner or later, Fatso.

1218
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,991
But before they do,
I want a piece of you myself.

1219
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:03,913
I figured that.

1220
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:06,159
See this knife?

1221
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:08,674
Is the one you pulled on Maggio.

1222
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:43,110
Whas happened?

1223
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,789
Is all right.

1224
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:53,993
Don't worry.

1225
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:55,919
I ain't gonna die.

1226
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:14,717
First Platoon present and accounted for!

1227
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,279
Second Platoon all accounted for!

1228
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:18,396
Third Platoon all present
and accounted for!

1229
01:33:18,680 --> 01:33:20,796
Fourth Platoon all present
and accounted for!

1230
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,393
Fifth Platoon all accounted for!

1231
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,472
Sixth Platoon all accounted for!

1232
01:33:25,160 --> 01:33:27,594
Company, dismissed!

1233
01:33:32,400 --> 01:33:34,118
Prewis still absent.

1234
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,998
Makes three days now.

1235
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:42,632
How long are you gonna carry him present,
Top?

1236
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,359
I just mention it.

1237
01:33:44,440 --> 01:33:46,351
Well, don't mention it.

1238
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:55,473
"Upon observing these incidents,
an investigation was made...

1239
01:33:55,560 --> 01:33:59,348
"...by the Inspector General's Department
over a period of several months.

1240
01:33:59,480 --> 01:34:01,232
"It was found that Captain Holmes...

1241
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:05,029
"...has been guilty of indefensible cruelty
to the aforesaid Private Prewitt.

1242
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:08,874
"As mentioned, this included instigation
of wholly unauthorised tactics...

1243
01:34:09,040 --> 01:34:13,033
"...to force the soldier
to join the interregiment boxing team."

1244
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:19,717
I'm waiting for your reply.

1245
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:21,554
I haven't any, sir.

1246
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:27,872
First thing I learned in the Army
was that an officer takes care of his men.

1247
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,520
It seems to be the first thing you forgot.

1248
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:31,874
My only regret is...

1249
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:35,236
...we have to keep you in uniform
till a court-martial is concluded.

1250
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:38,633
If there were any way
to avoid a court-martial, sir.

1251
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:43,355
There is one alternative, General,
if you are so disposed:

1252
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:47,513
A resignation for the good of the service
under Army regulations.

1253
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:50,318
Write a letter of resignation.

1254
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:52,476
Have it on my desk this afternoon.

1255
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,192
As far as I'm concerned...

1256
01:34:54,440 --> 01:34:57,159
...the quicker you're out,
the better for everybody...

1257
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:59,350
...especially the Army.

1258
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:02,358
Thas all, Holmes.

1259
01:35:09,560 --> 01:35:11,835
I know whas been going on in this outfit.

1260
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:14,229
I know how far some of you
have been out of line.

1261
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,393
If you want to remain non-coms,
you'd better snap into it.

1262
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:18,754
And another thing:

1263
01:35:19,120 --> 01:35:22,430
From now on,
no man will earn his stripes by boxing.

1264
01:35:24,720 --> 01:35:26,790
- Get rid of those.
- Yes, sir.

1265
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:28,753
Dismissed.

1266
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:36,715
- About Sergeant Galovitch.
- Yes, sir.

1267
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,519
Bust him. Sergeant Galovitch
is now Private Galovitch.

1268
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,989
Put him in charge of the latrine.

1269
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:43,388
What are you grinning at?

1270
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:46,995
I think the Company Commander
made a wise decision, sir.

1271
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,836
Company G, Captain Ross.

1272
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:53,834
Just a minute.

1273
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,753
- Is for you, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.

1274
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:00,434
Yes, sir.

1275
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:05,999
Yes, the parcel has already arrived.

1276
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:08,429
What?

1277
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,875
I've got to see you, Milt. Is important.

1278
01:36:14,120 --> 01:36:15,792
Okay, I'll get away somehow.

1279
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:18,878
Sure, thad be fine, yeah.

1280
01:36:19,240 --> 01:36:21,913
I'll be there in about an hour. Right.

1281
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:29,639
He's being sent back to the States,
sailing next week, and wants me to go.

1282
01:36:29,720 --> 01:36:30,755
What will we do?

1283
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:35,758
When do you think
you'll get your commission?

1284
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:42,314
I didn't put it in.
I filled it out, but I didn't sign it.

1285
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:46,633
I took it out of my desk a dozen times,
but I couldn't sign it.

1286
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:48,029
Why?

1287
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:51,994
- But it was the plan...
- I know.

1288
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:53,559
Is been weeks.

1289
01:36:53,640 --> 01:36:55,835
You can't say you'll do a thing
and not do it.

1290
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,148
Karen, listen to me.

1291
01:36:57,240 --> 01:37:00,516
Why didn't you do it?
Why didn't you tell me?

1292
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,352
Be back in a minute.

1293
01:37:05,880 --> 01:37:08,633
Sorry, I thought you were somebody else.

1294
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:17,835
I thought it was a guy from our company,
Prewitt, the kid I told you about.

1295
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:20,639
He got mixed up with a girl
at the New Congress Club.

1296
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:23,553
He's AWOL, probably in lots of trouble.

1297
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:26,713
Robert E. Lee Prewitt, a crazy, no-good...

1298
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:32,792
Karen, I'm no officer. I'm an enlisted man.

1299
01:37:33,200 --> 01:37:34,269
I can't be anything else.

1300
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:36,749
If I try to be an officer,
I'll be putting on an act.

1301
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:40,310
I just can't do it. Please don't ask me why.

1302
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:43,313
I know why.

1303
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,430
You don't have to become an officer now...

1304
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:48,954
...now that Dana's out of the Army.

1305
01:37:49,160 --> 01:37:51,435
You just don't want to marry me.

1306
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,988
You're already married to the Army.

1307
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,832
I love you, Karen.

1308
01:38:01,080 --> 01:38:02,672
I know.

1309
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,799
I don't want you to go back to Holmes.

1310
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,428
I don't want to, either. But I am.

1311
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:11,949
There's nothing else for me to do.

1312
01:38:12,240 --> 01:38:15,118
Is no good with us, Milt.
It could never have been any good.

1313
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:16,838
Hiding, sneaking.

1314
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:18,958
It had to wear out.

1315
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,038
Good-bye, Sergeant.

1316
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:27,194
- Thanks.
- It ain't good-bye, is...

1317
01:38:28,200 --> 01:38:30,839
We'll see each other again, somewhere.

1318
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:34,758
Of course we will. Somewhere.

1319
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:49,989
Here it is.

1320
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:52,469
Got it on the inside page already.

1321
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:54,435
"Still no clue...

1322
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:57,791
"...in the fatal stabbing
of Staff Sergeant James R. Judson."

1323
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,392
Did you hear me?

1324
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,795
Are you trying to set a new worlïs record?

1325
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:09,955
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.

1326
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,509
To the memory of Robert E. Lee Prewitt...

1327
01:39:13,960 --> 01:39:16,952
...holder of the new worlïs record.

1328
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,668
- Everything all right, Top?
- Great.

1329
01:39:36,840 --> 01:39:40,230
This is a beautiful meal to put in front
of a guy on a Sunday morning.

1330
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,912
Congratulations.

1331
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:57,676
They sure look pretty
over them mountains.

1332
01:39:57,760 --> 01:39:59,079
Don't they, though?

1333
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:10,348
Sounds like they're dynamiting
down at Wheeler Field.

1334
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:14,228
Mighty ambitious.
Sunday morning before 8:00?

1335
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:29,516
The Japs are bombing Wheeler Field!

1336
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,875
I've seen the red circles on the...

1337
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:03,870
Get out of here. Hurry up! Go!

1338
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:09,990
This is a real attack, not a manoeuvre.

1339
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:12,310
The Japanese are bombing Pearl Harbor.

1340
01:41:12,400 --> 01:41:14,755
Please keep in your homes.
Do not go on the streets.

1341
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:16,114
This is a real attack.

1342
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:19,590
Japanese planes are bombing
our Naval and Army installations.

1343
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:24,873
- Quiet down!
- At ease!

1344
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:28,948
Non-coms, get BARs and ammunition
from the supply room. Get up on the roof.

1345
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,029
Anderson!

1346
01:41:30,520 --> 01:41:33,239
You're in charge of the loading detail.
Get moving.

1347
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,199
Rest of you men, listen to me.

1348
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:38,790
Every man get his rifle, go to his bunk
and stay there. And I mean...

1349
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,711
...stay there!

1350
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:45,359
Shut up! You'll get your ears shot off
if you go outside.

1351
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:49,194
You'll get plenty of chances to be heroes
with Japs in your lap before night.

1352
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,828
Now get moving, we're wasting time!

1353
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:59,519
Into the kitchen and make a pot of coffee.
Wait a minute, a barrel of coffee!

1354
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:21,754
I can't issue live ammunition
without a signed order.

1355
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,593
- The Captain ain't here, jerk!
- Sorry. No order, no ammo.

1356
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,477
- Whas the matter?
- I got my orders!

1357
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:29,028
Army regulations state that I can't...

1358
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:34,959
you blind? Give me the key!

1359
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,554
- I got to obey orders, Top.
- I'll see you get a medal!

1360
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:40,074
- Bust it down, boys!
- I warned you!

1361
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,311
Don't go out, Warden, you'll get killed!

1362
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,914
Put your pants on. You'll catch cold!

1363
01:43:32,760 --> 01:43:34,432
Give them a hand with this ammo!

1364
01:43:34,640 --> 01:43:35,834
Put that stuff over there.

1365
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:44,194
Watch your fire, boys,
and lead those planes!

1366
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,389
Friday's gone crazy!
He's blowing the Cavalry Charge!

1367
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:11,114
Here they come, boys!

1368
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:43,472
I got him, Pete! I got him!

1369
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:45,512
I got him!

1370
01:44:53,400 --> 01:44:55,789
The danger of an invasion
continues to exist.

1371
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:58,952
Infantry from Schofield Barracks
moved out within a few hours...

1372
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:00,837
...and have manned beach positions.

1373
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,353
This is no manoeuvre.

1374
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,391
This is the real McCoy.

1375
01:45:04,680 --> 01:45:06,272
Look out for falling shrapnel.

1376
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,913
Keep under cover.

1377
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,595
Blackout and curfew restrictions
will be rigidly enforced.

1378
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:14,678
Stay in your homes.
Don't use the telephone.

1379
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:19,269
Rest assured that immediate relay
to you of any and all information...

1380
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:21,391
We've been to Queen's Hospital
giving blood.

1381
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:22,515
The town's a madhouse!

1382
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:24,352
A big house was bombed on Kuhio Street.

1383
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:27,159
The drugstore down on McNully
and King is smashed flat!

1384
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:28,759
A man and his wife were killed.

1385
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:32,953
Your attention, please.
Listen to this carefully and keep calm.

1386
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:36,118
The danger of an invasion
continues to exist.

1387
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:39,795
And the planes have been identified
as Japanese planes.

1388
01:45:40,760 --> 01:45:42,796
Who do they think they're fighting?

1389
01:45:42,960 --> 01:45:46,475
They're picking trouble
with the best Army in the world.

1390
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:48,995
Where you going?

1391
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:52,834
I gotta get back to the company.

1392
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,554
The company? But why?

1393
01:45:56,040 --> 01:45:57,109
Why?

1394
01:45:57,520 --> 01:45:59,988
But you can't. You're not well yet.

1395
01:46:00,440 --> 01:46:02,874
You're AWOL.
They'll throw you in the stockade.

1396
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:06,591
They'll be throwing them out
of the stockade. They need everyone.

1397
01:46:06,680 --> 01:46:08,238
But your side'll open up.

1398
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:11,195
They'll find out you killed that soldier.

1399
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:14,438
Once I report in to the company,
they'll take care of me.

1400
01:46:14,520 --> 01:46:16,078
I'll be all right once I get back.

1401
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:19,436
But you'll never make it!
There's patrols all over!

1402
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:22,114
I'll make it. I know a shortcut.

1403
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:26,751
Prew, stay till morning.

1404
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:29,434
Maybe if you stay till morning
you'll change your mind.

1405
01:46:36,720 --> 01:46:38,517
Prew, don't go!

1406
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,558
I'll do anything you want.

1407
01:46:41,440 --> 01:46:45,149
We can go back to the States together,
we can even get married.

1408
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:51,392
If you go now,
I'll never see you again, I know it.

1409
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,195
I'm sorry.

1410
01:46:58,240 --> 01:47:00,595
What do you want to go back
to the Army for?

1411
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:03,478
What did the Army do for you
besides treat you like dirt...

1412
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:05,357
...and give you one awful going over?

1413
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:09,433
Get your friend killed!
What do you want to go back for?

1414
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:12,028
What do I want to go back for?
I'm a soldier.

1415
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:16,030
A soldier! A regular.
From the regular Army!

1416
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:17,678
A 30-year man!

1417
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:23,228
I got to turn off the lights,
'cause of the blackout outside.

1418
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:39,154
They say they've seen parachutists
land up in the hills.

1419
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:40,514
I ain't worried about them.

1420
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:42,431
Saboteurs is what worries me.

1421
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:45,557
I bet they're operating
all over these islands.

1422
01:48:55,720 --> 01:48:56,709
Halt!

1423
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:00,469
Halt!

1424
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:12,989
Halt!

1425
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:50,350
Do you know this man, Sergeant?

1426
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:51,794
Yes, sir.

1427
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:54,276
He didn't have any regular identification.

1428
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:56,715
They found a card on him with his name.

1429
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:58,791
Seems to be membership of a club:

1430
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:00,751
The New Congress Club.

1431
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:03,998
You'd better take care of these, Sergeant.

1432
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,479
Was this man a friend of yours?

1433
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:12,513
Yes, sir. He musve been trying to reach
our company position up the beach here.

1434
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:14,238
Then why didn't he halt?

1435
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:17,357
He was always a hardhead, sir,
but he was a good soldier.

1436
01:50:17,480 --> 01:50:19,869
He loved the Army
more than any soldier I ever knew.

1437
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:23,234
I see. I'm sorry, Sergeant.

1438
01:50:38,440 --> 01:50:40,795
You just couldn't play it smart, could you?

1439
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:45,115
All you had to do was box, but no,
not you, you hardhead.

1440
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:50,112
Funny thing is, there ain't gonna be
any boxing championships this year.

1441
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:59,069
Whas the matter?
Ain't you ever seen a dead man?

1442
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:02,197
Les get this body out of here!
We ain't got all night!

1443
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:25,191
Is very beautiful, isn't it?

1444
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:33,149
I think is the most beautiful place
I ever saw in my life.

1445
01:51:34,640 --> 01:51:37,438
I can almost see where I worked from here.

1446
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:42,798
There's a legend:

1447
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:47,515
If they float in toward shore,
you'll come back some day.

1448
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:49,998
If they float out to sea, you won't.

1449
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:57,631
I won't come back.

1450
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:01,759
My fiancé was killed on December 7.

1451
01:52:03,200 --> 01:52:04,553
I'm sorry.

1452
01:52:05,400 --> 01:52:07,231
He was a bomber pilot.

1453
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:10,273
He tried to taxi his plane
to the edge of the apron.

1454
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:12,709
The Japs made a direct hit on it.

1455
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:16,159
Maybe you read about it in the papers.

1456
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:18,750
He was awarded the Silver Star.

1457
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:21,995
They sent it to his mother.

1458
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:24,156
She wrote me she wanted me to have it.

1459
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:26,756
Thas very fine of her.

1460
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:30,478
They're very fine people. Southern people.

1461
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:33,555
He was named after a general.

1462
01:52:34,360 --> 01:52:35,918
Robert E. Lee...

1463
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:37,749
...Prewitt.

1464
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:40,829
Who?

1465
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:45,756
Robert E. Lee Prewitt.

1466
01:52:48,440 --> 01:52:50,032
Isn't that a silly old name?
