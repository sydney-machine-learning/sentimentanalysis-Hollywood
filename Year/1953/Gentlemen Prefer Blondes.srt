Dorothy, wait a minute.

34
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,822
Louie, will you ask Mr. Esmond
to come back to our dressing room.

35
00:04:39,823 --> 00:04:41,101
He's sitting in his usual place.

36
00:04:41,134 --> 00:04:42,510
Right away, Miss Blake.

37
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:44,670
What's the rush?
He's not gonna run away.

38
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:47,796
- I know, but I just can't wait.
- For what?

39
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:50,723
Didn't you notice?
His pocket was bulging.

40
00:04:50,973 --> 00:04:52,800
That could be a bag of gumdrops.

41
00:04:53,058 --> 00:04:55,698
No, it was square bulge,
like a box for a ring.

42
00:04:55,699 --> 00:04:58,266
I think he's got a
present for me.

43
00:04:58,324 --> 00:05:00,248
You know, you're the only
girl in the world...

44
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,222
...that can stand on a stage with a
spotlight in your eye...

45
00:05:02,443 --> 00:05:05,397
...and still see a diamond
inside a man's pocket.

46
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:08,607
Thank you, Louie.

47
00:05:17,855 --> 00:05:19,288
Good evening, Mr. Esmond.

48
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:21,880
- Won't you, pray, come in.
- Thank you, I'd love to.

49
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:23,833
- Hi, Gus.
- Good evening Dorothy.

50
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,664
You were wonderful tonight, darling.

51
00:05:25,665 --> 00:05:28,041
- Simply wonderful! You were magnificent!
- Thank you.

52
00:05:28,304 --> 00:05:29,574
You were good too.

53
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:33,049
Gee, thanks, 'cause that
makes me feel all warm inside.

54
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,802
- Mr. Esmond!
- Is it the right size?

55
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:42,099
It can never be too big.
Do you think it's too small, Dorothy?

56
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:45,810
It looks like it ought to
have a highball around it.

57
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:47,657
I mean,
does it fit your finger?

58
00:05:47,908 --> 00:05:50,233
Yes, it fits perfect.

59
00:05:50,494 --> 00:05:55,322
Daddy, I'll bet you made me
the happiest girl in the world.

60
00:05:59,712 --> 00:06:01,073
I don't know what you do, honey...

61
00:06:01,074 --> 00:06:03,081
...unless you use Novocaine
on your lipstick?

62
00:06:03,341 --> 00:06:07,208
Daddy? Daddy?
May I tell Dorothy?

63
00:06:07,428 --> 00:06:09,088
If you wish.

64
00:06:09,347 --> 00:06:12,681
Dorothy, Mr. Esmond and I
are going to be married.

65
00:06:12,935 --> 00:06:14,050
To each other?

66
00:06:14,051 --> 00:06:16,553
Of course to each other.
Who else to?

67
00:06:16,813 --> 00:06:17,970
I don't know about you Gus.

68
00:06:17,971 --> 00:06:21,475
I always sort of figured Lorelei would
end up with the Secretary of the Treasury.

69
00:06:21,702 --> 00:06:22,769
Dorothy, guess what.

70
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,073
On Saturday we're sailing
on the Isle de Paris.

71
00:06:25,138 --> 00:06:27,535
- "Ile" de Paris.
- We're going to be married in Europe.

72
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:30,297
Why not getting married in
America and then go to Europe?

73
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,729
- Well...
- Or is that old-fashioned way?

74
00:06:32,746 --> 00:06:34,746
Well, we've made our plans.

75
00:06:34,832 --> 00:06:36,077
Come in.

76
00:06:36,197 --> 00:06:38,429
Mr. Esmond, a long
distance call for you.

77
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:39,952
Oh dear. From Dayton, Ohio.

78
00:06:40,171 --> 00:06:42,109
Thank you very much,
I'll be right there.

79
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,122
It must be Father.

80
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:49,337
I hope nothing's happened.
I'll meet you at my table, dear.

81
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,890
Father! Never misses, Gus' old man.
Right on cue. Too bad, honey.

82
00:06:57,147 --> 00:06:59,468
Nothing's going wrong this time.

83
00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:00,698
Lorelei,

84
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:04,147
...the old boy is not about to let
you commit matrimony with his son.

85
00:07:04,363 --> 00:07:07,115
I think he'd rather shove him
down an elevator shaft.

86
00:07:07,324 --> 00:07:12,319
Dorothy, I'm sailing on Saturday,
with or without Mr. Esmond.

87
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:16,709
And I'm not coming back from Europe
until he comes and gets me.

88
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:18,052
When we're in France...

89
00:07:18,053 --> 00:07:21,577
...where his father can't phone
him twice a day...

90
00:07:21,882 --> 00:07:25,603
Well, Gus will never let you go alone.

91
00:07:25,928 --> 00:07:31,468
Sometimes Mr. Esmond finds it
very difficult to say no to me.

92
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:34,686
Well, that's very possible.

93
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:50,364
Come on, guys, we can't check the roll
if you don't stick together.

94
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:55,537
Peters? Randall?
Sanford? Sims?

95
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:57,708
- Stevens?
- Look at that.

96
00:07:57,878 --> 00:08:00,452
Stevens? Willard J. Stevens?

97
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:03,164
- Why don't you answer...?
- I'm busy.

98
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:08,253
Boy, oh, boy!

99
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,867
Check your passport
right over there.

100
00:08:09,868 --> 00:08:10,383
Thank you.

101
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:11,414
Pardon please...

102
00:08:11,415 --> 00:08:13,288
...is this the way
to Europe, France?

103
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:14,432
To where?

104
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:16,223
Not Europe, France, honey.

105
00:08:16,224 --> 00:08:19,115
- France is in Europe.
- Who said it wasn't?

106
00:08:19,156 --> 00:08:20,286
Well, you wouldn't say...

107
00:08:20,287 --> 00:08:22,945
"is this the way to North America, Mexico"?
Would you?

108
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:26,191
- If that's where I want to go, I would.
- The dealer passes.

109
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:30,987
- This ship goes to Cherbourg, France.
- Thank you ever so. See?

110
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:33,128
Say, what's all the talent
in the blue jackets?

111
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:34,574
It's not a band, is it?

112
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:38,457
No, no, Miss, that's the Olympic team.
They're sailing with you on this ship.

113
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:40,306
- The Olympic team?
- Yes.

114
00:08:40,372 --> 00:08:43,771
For me! Now wasn't that
thoughtful of somebody?

115
00:08:43,884 --> 00:08:46,507
- Dibs on the shot-putter.
- Dorothy Shaw!

116
00:08:46,805 --> 00:08:47,872
I want you to remember...

117
00:08:47,873 --> 00:08:50,267
...you're supposed to be
the chaperon on this trip.

118
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:52,144
Now, let's get
this straight, Gus:

119
00:08:52,352 --> 00:08:55,396
The chaperon job's is to see that
nobody else has any fun.

120
00:08:55,437 --> 00:08:57,892
But nobody
chaperons the chaperon.

121
00:08:57,947 --> 00:09:00,357
- Dorothy...
- That's why I'm so right for this job.

122
00:09:00,611 --> 00:09:02,603
Passports, please.

123
00:09:03,989 --> 00:09:07,441
I thought you were going to be late.
Here's your ticket.

124
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,696
They're all over there,
at the passport desk.

125
00:09:09,697 --> 00:09:11,788
I want you after the blond.

126
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:13,831
The brunette's her
friend, Dorothy Shaw.

127
00:09:13,832 --> 00:09:15,781
I never mind about her.
We don't care what she does.

128
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:18,098
I care.

129
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:20,740
Have fun, son.

130
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:23,324
Come on, please you guys, move along.

131
00:09:23,325 --> 00:09:26,627
- Let's get on board.
- Have a nice trip.

132
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:39,964
Steve, suppose the ship
hit an iceberg and sank.

133
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:42,062
Which one would you
save from drowning?

134
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:44,734
Those girls couldn't drown.

135
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,080
- Right in here, mademoiselle.
- Thank you.

136
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,672
My, it's just like a room, isn't it?

137
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:03,298
Oh, look!
Round windows!

138
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,680
Yes, dear.

139
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:07,325
- Just put that there, Frisbee.
- Yes, Sir.

140
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,685
And, Frisbee,
wait for me on the pier.

141
00:10:09,764 --> 00:10:11,589
- Yes, Sir.
- Lorelei.

142
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,720
- Where's Dorothy?
- I don't know.

143
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:16,040
Someone whistled at her
and she disappeared.

144
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,565
I hope she's not gonna be
a bad influence on you?

145
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:20,212
Oh no, lover.

146
00:10:20,213 --> 00:10:22,574
Dorothy's not bad, honest.

147
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:23,959
She's just dumb.

148
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:25,673
Always falling in love
with some man...

149
00:10:25,674 --> 00:10:27,131
...just because
he's good-looking.

150
00:10:27,132 --> 00:10:28,154
Oh dear, that's not...

151
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,184
I keep telling her...

152
00:10:29,185 --> 00:10:31,662
...it's just as easy to fall in
love with a rich man...

153
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:34,574
...as a poor man.
But she says, yes, but...

154
00:10:34,793 --> 00:10:36,504
If they're tall, dark and handsome...

155
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:40,214
...she never gets around to
vital statistics, until it's too late.

156
00:10:40,301 --> 00:10:42,126
That's why I'm her
best friend, I guess.

157
00:10:42,127 --> 00:10:44,827
She really needs somebody
like I to educate her.

158
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:50,008
Yes, dear, but very few girls have
your wonderful willingness to learn.

159
00:10:50,227 --> 00:10:51,750
I suppose that's true.

160
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,438
I want you to put
this in a safe place.

161
00:10:54,648 --> 00:10:56,571
- What is it?
- A letter of credit.

162
00:10:56,855 --> 00:10:58,272
Oh, that's real sweet!

163
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:00,529
You started writing me even
before I went away.

164
00:11:00,651 --> 00:11:03,926
No, no, dear, you see a
letter of credit is like money.

165
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:05,074
Money?

166
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:08,078
Yes, just take it to a bank
in Paris when you get there.

167
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,992
Oh, that's wonderful!

168
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:13,906
Be sure and write me every day.
I'll be so lonesome.

169
00:11:14,126 --> 00:11:17,792
I bought you
a little going-away present, dear.

170
00:11:18,006 --> 00:11:20,580
Daddy! Daddy!

171
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:24,383
Sometimes I think there's only one
of you in the whole wide world.

172
00:11:27,057 --> 00:11:29,809
Oh, sorry, wrong room.

173
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:34,623
- Who is that?
- A stranger. He had the wrong room.

174
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,749
Yeah, but he's good-looking.
Hope he isn't just seeing someone off.

175
00:11:37,802 --> 00:11:40,691
- Dorothy...
- Well, quite a little place we have here.

176
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:43,983
Oh, look, fellas, come on in.
Folks, meet the relay team.

177
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:46,073
- How do you do? Nice to know you?
- How do you do?

178
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:48,403
We're gonna have ourselves
a little bon voyage party.

179
00:11:48,404 --> 00:11:50,498
Skeeter, put the
phonograph in there.

180
00:11:50,706 --> 00:11:53,257
Come on in, everybody.
Use that door, come on in here.

181
00:11:53,258 --> 00:11:55,604
Make yourselves at home.
I'll get the glasses.

182
00:11:55,608 --> 00:11:59,565
Hallo... Hi... You're welcome...
Who's got the champagne?
There it is.

183
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:05,511
Dorothy Shaw, I'm counting on you
to keep those athletes to yourself.

184
00:12:05,722 --> 00:12:09,056
What a coincidence!
That's my plan too.

185
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:14,017
Gangway! Pardon me. Who needs a glass?

186
00:12:14,315 --> 00:12:18,893
- Lorelei, I want to talk to you.
- Sure.

187
00:12:19,112 --> 00:12:22,362
Dear, I want to tell you...

188
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:26,358
I want to remind you
of something very...

189
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,570
Stop that, please.
It's most distracting.

190
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:35,957
Dear, a lot depends on how
you conduct yourself on this trip.

191
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:38,913
As you know, Dad is dead set
against our marriage.

192
00:12:38,965 --> 00:12:39,724
And well...

193
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,232
...even the slightest hint
of any scandal...

194
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:43,942
...even the slightest.

195
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:45,545
I don't know what I could do about it.

196
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,926
My goodness, lover.
You don't have to tell me that.

197
00:12:50,022 --> 00:12:53,430
Oh, I'd give anything in the world
if I were sailing with you, baby.

198
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:57,183
Me too. I don't know
what I'll do in Europe without you.

199
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,981
I don't know what I'll do
without you, either.

200
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,137
I'm not so sure about that.

201
00:13:03,138 --> 00:13:05,700
You can be a pretty
naughty boy sometimes.

202
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,909
Oh, Lee, you don't have to
worry about trusting me.

203
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,747
I do, though.

204
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,296

- Hi.
- Hi.

261
00:19:00,076 --> 00:19:04,288
- Hi, Miss Shaw. What are you going to be doing?
- All right, guys, keep moving.

262
00:19:06,499 --> 00:19:11,920
- "Mr. Amos Jones and valet."
- What are you doing?

263
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:17,921
I'm checking the passenger list.
"Mr. Alfred Loman and valet."

264
00:19:18,136 --> 00:19:21,173
"Mr. Eugene Martin and valet."

265
00:19:21,431 --> 00:19:24,266
Why the sudden interest in valets?

266
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:27,237
When a man has "and
valet" after his name...

267
00:19:27,238 --> 00:19:29,305
...he's definitely
worthwhile.

268
00:19:29,524 --> 00:19:32,478
I'm simply trying to find
a suitable gentleman escort for you.

269
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:37,362
Well, don't bother. I just
provided myself with about 20.

270
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:41,942
Dorothy, did you ever hear
of a rich pole-vaulter?

271
00:19:42,162 --> 00:19:47,156
Maybe not, but who cares? I like a man
who can run faster than I can.

272
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,582
I hate to think where you'll wind up.

273
00:19:49,795 --> 00:19:53,460
You're wasting all your time on
unrefined persons without any money.

274
00:19:53,665 --> 00:19:54,916
Honey, did it ever
occur to you...

275
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:57,533
...that some people just don't
care about money?

276
00:19:57,803 --> 00:20:00,674
Please, don't be silly.
We're talking serious.

277
00:20:01,061 --> 00:20:03,473
You don't want to wind up with
a loveless marriage, do you?

278
00:20:03,474 --> 00:20:05,386
Me, loveless?

279
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:06,503
That's right!

280
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:08,427
Because if a girl's
spending all of her time...

281
00:20:08,428 --> 00:20:10,432
...worrying about the money
she doesn't have...

282
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,437
...how is she going to have
any time for being in love?

283
00:20:13,653 --> 00:20:18,149
I want you to find happiness
and stop having fun.

284
00:20:18,408 --> 00:20:22,821
- That baffles me.
- You'll thank me some day.

285
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:28,377
Here's a good one:
"Henry Spofford III and valet."

286
00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:30,036
I remember reading.

287
00:20:30,037 --> 00:20:33,248
The Spofford family owns
practically a whole state.

288
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,800
A big one too.
I think it's Pennsylvania.

289
00:20:37,011 --> 00:20:40,048
I guess I could settle
for Pennsylvania.

290
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:42,240
Hello, there!
Mrs.Henry Spofford III.

291
00:20:42,329 --> 00:20:45,389
Mrs. Henry Spofford
III and valet...

292
00:20:45,603 --> 00:20:47,452
...not going to have
anything I don't have.

293
00:20:47,453 --> 00:20:48,807
I'll see you later.

294
00:20:49,024 --> 00:20:50,794
Don't forget the cocktail party.

295
00:20:50,824 --> 00:20:52,724
- All right.
- 5:30.

296
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,702
- The whole team?
- Until after the games.

297
00:21:01,913 --> 00:21:05,088
You mean to tell me you eat at 6
and have to be in bed at 9?

298
00:21:05,142 --> 00:21:07,702
That's right. Coach is strict
and check up on everybody.

299
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,581
Holy smoke, 9:00!
That's just when life begins.

300
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,756
- All right you guys.
- All right you guys

301
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:29,022

One, two, three, four.

334
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,958
- Did you say $50?
- Mai oui, monsieur.

335
00:25:15,178 --> 00:25:17,696
That's a fairly tidy sum
just to get a seat at a table.

336
00:25:17,738 --> 00:25:19,946
That's the law of supply
and demand, monsieur.

337
00:25:19,947 --> 00:25:23,527
I get many requests for a seat at
Miss Lee and Miss Shaw's table.

338
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:27,722
And the price goes
up and up and up.

339
00:25:27,723 --> 00:25:30,357
That's inevitable.
Je regrette, monsieur.

340
00:25:31,654 --> 00:25:37,196
Je regrette it more than vous.
However, the name's Malone.

341
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:40,827
- Better get it down there while I can still afford it.
- Merci monsieur Malone.

342
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:44,743
- Bonjour, mademoiselle.
- Are you the headwaiter?

343
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:47,796
- At your service, mademoiselle.
- I'm Miss Lee.

344
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:53,510
Oh, Miss Lee. Well, now I understand.
What can I do for you, Miss Lee?

345
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,631
Put a certain gentleman at my table.

346
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,932
There's nothing I can do for you.

347
00:26:00,143 --> 00:26:03,512
All seating arrangements are
completed, final., finished, compris?

348
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:04,936
That's too bad.

349
00:26:04,937 --> 00:26:08,138
Once I was in Atlantic City
and all the gentlemen in the hotel...

350
00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:09,360
...wanted to sit at my table.

351
00:26:09,612 --> 00:26:11,918
Oh well, I can
understand that.

352
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,069
Some of them even went to the
headwaiter to give him money.

353
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:18,903
That happens. What can one do?
One takes it. Why not?

354
00:26:19,122 --> 00:26:23,451
- That headwaiter had to give it back.
- Indeed? Why?

355
00:26:23,668 --> 00:26:26,022
Because I had all my
meals in my room.

356
00:26:26,023 --> 00:26:29,172
I mean, I didn't even
come to the table at all.

357
00:26:29,382 --> 00:26:32,632
So, naturally,
the men wanted their money back.

358
00:26:32,697 --> 00:26:34,359
Oh, mademoiselle, I beg you...

359
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,676
Do you want me to have
all my meals in my room?

360
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:39,055
- That must not be, mademoiselle.
- Of course.

361
00:26:39,268 --> 00:26:43,480
If Mr. Henry Spofford III
is seated at my table...

362
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:46,997
- It shall be, mademoiselle.
- Thank you ever so.

363
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,583
Oh, mademoiselle.

364
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,871
Hi.

365
00:27:00,394 --> 00:27:02,810
Oh! Hi, Miss Shaw.
Well, it's nice to see you.

366
00:27:02,926 --> 00:27:05,064
In case you don't
remember, my name is Watson.

367
00:27:05,065 --> 00:27:08,583
- Mr. Watson.
- Here we are, all ready for you.

368
00:27:08,841 --> 00:27:11,047
- Thanks, I need it.
- What's the matter?

369
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:15,292
Can you imagine? The entire Olympic
team has to be in bed by 9:00.

370
00:27:15,293 --> 00:27:17,287
What can you do about
a thing like that?

371
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:21,307
- Send a letter to your congressman.
- Catch me a pigeon, I'll be glad to.

372
00:27:21,521 --> 00:27:24,160
Er, Miss Shaw, may I present Sir
Francis Beekman?

373
00:27:24,161 --> 00:27:25,479
- How do you do?
- How do you do.

374
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,025
A pigeon, if there
ever was one.

375
00:27:27,235 --> 00:27:28,777
Note the blood red ruby eyes.

376
00:27:28,994 --> 00:27:31,528
I see, there is no reason
to run a fellow down.

377
00:27:31,529 --> 00:27:33,914
He's jealous, because I have a way
with the ladies. - How do you do it?

378
00:27:33,989 --> 00:27:36,532
What makes it different with the
ladies it's that diamond mine of yours.

379
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:37,792
Diamond mine?

380
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,730
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'll go on being the host.

381
00:27:39,873 --> 00:27:41,966
- Cheeky fellow. Good sort, though.
- Is it true?

382
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:45,080
What say we sit down
and make ourselves comfortable? What?

383
00:27:45,137 --> 00:27:47,582
I understand that you're
an entertainer, Miss Shaw.

384
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,434
- I... why, but sure a good one, though.
- Thanks.

385
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,586
Say, is that on the level?
Do you own a diamond mine?

386
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:56,170
Well, I am happy to say I do, my dear.
Are you interested in diamonds?

387
00:27:56,206 --> 00:27:58,373
No, no, not particularly, but...

388
00:27:58,374 --> 00:28:00,667
Really, you must be a very quite...
extraordinary girl.

389
00:28:00,853 --> 00:28:04,139
- Will you do me a favor, sir?
- Piggy, just call me Piggy.

390
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,186
- Will you do me a favor, Piggy?
- Anything, my dear, name it.

391
00:28:07,402 --> 00:28:10,628
Would you be careful not to spread
it around about your diamond mine.

392
00:28:10,629 --> 00:28:12,943
I wouldn't want my girlfriend
to hear about that.

393
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:14,986
Oh, she doesn't care
for diamonds either, huh?

394
00:28:15,202 --> 00:28:17,932
Believe me, Piggy. I'm only trying
to save everybody trouble.

395
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:20,327
Do not tell her
about the diamonds.

396
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:22,540
Did you say "diamonds"?

397
00:28:22,752 --> 00:28:26,584
Well, well, well!
By George, I must say!

398
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:31,336
No doubt about it, no sirree.
My judge. No doubt about it at all.

399
00:28:31,552 --> 00:28:36,345
- Miss Lee, meet Piggy.
- Delighted! Delighted!

400
00:28:39,394 --> 00:28:42,102
You did say "diamonds." I can tell.

401
00:28:42,313 --> 00:28:43,185
Yes, my dear.

402
00:28:43,186 --> 00:28:47,026
You see my firm controls the second largest
diamond diggings in South Africa.

403
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:49,080
But it seems we mustn't
say anything about it.

404
00:28:49,089 --> 00:28:51,680
This young lady has a friend,
she doesn't want to know about me.

405
00:28:52,742 --> 00:28:55,992
- I wonder why.
- Oh, no, you don't.

406
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:57,540
Pardon me saying so.

407
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:01,869
But having heard so much about you,
and all, I expected you'd be much older.

408
00:29:02,126 --> 00:29:07,583
Me? Oh my, you don't say. By George!
Older than what?

409
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:09,258
The Pyramids.

410
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,903
Of course, I always say if
a man isn't a certain age...

411
00:29:11,904 --> 00:29:13,881
...he just isn't interesting.

412
00:29:14,181 --> 00:29:16,221
Oh, honey, lay off!

413
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:18,014
Bless my soul. Bless my s...

414
00:29:18,015 --> 00:29:18,840
Would you care to dance?

415
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:24,019
I'd enjoy to dance.
Thank you ever so.

416
00:29:26,194 --> 00:29:28,352
- Could you use another drink?
- No, thanks.

417
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,363
Can't tell the players
without a program.

418
00:29:30,364 --> 00:29:34,143
Well, I certainly want to
know who the players are.

419
00:29:34,202 --> 00:29:35,310
For instance, Sir...

420
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:37,836
...who's the young man who just
tried to steal second base?

421
00:29:37,918 --> 00:29:39,327
My name's Malone.

422
00:29:39,749 --> 00:29:44,163
Mine's Shaw, Dorothy.
Well, Mr. Malone?

423
00:29:44,422 --> 00:29:47,183
You're the most attractive girl in
the room so I came over to tell you.

424
00:29:47,184 --> 00:29:48,122
Do you mind?

425
00:29:48,384 --> 00:29:51,862
No, I might as well warn you,
flattery will get you anywhere.

426
00:29:51,863 --> 00:29:54,802
In that case,
we haven't any problems.

427
00:29:54,868 --> 00:29:55,701
As a matter of fact...

428
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:58,217
...I've been wondering why
you hadn't shown up before this.

429
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:01,664
Well, I... I...
had some business to attend to.

430
00:30:01,665 --> 00:30:03,727
Then this isn't a vacation?

431
00:30:03,983 --> 00:30:06,818
Not entirely.
There's still a telephone.

432
00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:09,815
- In fact, I just had some bad news.
- Oh?

433
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,935
My best 2-year-old
will never run again.

434
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:15,581
Bowed a tendon.
He's worth $30,000 or $40,000.

435
00:30:15,788 --> 00:30:18,908
Not that I care about the money.
This might've been a good one.

436
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:21,210
Oh no, you're not one
of those, are you?

437
00:30:21,211 --> 00:30:22,375
One of what?

438
00:30:22,586 --> 00:30:25,706
The kind who thinks he has to tell
a girl how much money he has.

439
00:30:25,923 --> 00:30:27,963
What's the matter with having money?

440
00:30:28,176 --> 00:30:29,829
Yes, I'm afraid you are.

441
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,134
Do me a favor.

442
00:30:31,135 --> 00:30:32,867
Will you Malone go
whistle up a rope?

443
00:30:32,893 --> 00:30:34,086
No, wait a minute...

444
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:36,564
You might as well know
I can't stand rich playboys...

445
00:30:36,664 --> 00:30:39,132
- ...who think all they have to is start...
- Now wait a minute!

446
00:30:39,135 --> 00:30:43,144
I'm not that bad all the time.
Sometimes I'm very nice.

447
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,070
Sometimes I just speak
without thinking.

448
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:49,030
I get the picture.
You're half sweet, half acid.

449
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,573
- Please, Miss Shaw, I made a mistake.
- Yes, you did.

450
00:30:52,827 --> 00:30:55,474
Honestly, someone gave
me some bad information.

451
00:30:55,475 --> 00:30:57,536
Now that I've put
my foot in it...

452
00:30:57,748 --> 00:31:00,856
...it seems to me I remember that
it wasn't you they were talking about,

453
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:01,973
...but your girlfriend.

454
00:31:02,634 --> 00:31:05,712
- Oh, Lorelei.
- Or am I wrong again?

455
00:31:05,923 --> 00:31:09,838
No, money is rather
a hobby of Lorelei's.

456
00:31:11,763 --> 00:31:13,341
Oh, Piggy.

457
00:31:13,556 --> 00:31:15,813
You're kind of worried
about her, aren't you.

458
00:31:15,814 --> 00:31:18,349
You're very observing.

459
00:31:18,562 --> 00:31:20,472
Am I forgiven?

460
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,691
Considering the man shortage
on this craft...

461
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:27,566
Good. We'll start all over again.
And I promise that I...

462
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,488
We're gonna be interrupted.

463
00:31:29,907 --> 00:31:31,283
We just had a jolly time. What?

464
00:31:31,613 --> 00:31:35,034
Oh, Mr. Malone, Miss Lee and Piggy,
...there I go again.

465
00:31:35,107 --> 00:31:37,402
- Sir Francis Beekman...
- How do you do? How do you do? Hi.

466
00:31:37,493 --> 00:31:40,850
Oh Dorothy, Piggy is
a super-best dancer.

467
00:31:40,856 --> 00:31:43,335
So light on his feet,
you'll never believe it.

468
00:31:43,546 --> 00:31:44,549
I was sure he would be.

469
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,626
No, no, say, you're
trying to flatter me, that...

470
00:31:47,842 --> 00:31:50,341
- What's the matter?
- Lady Beekman, my wife.

471
00:31:50,357 --> 00:31:52,086
I thought it was
his diamond mine.

472
00:31:52,103 --> 00:31:53,167
There you are my dear.

473
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:54,637
Won't you come and join us?

474
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,859
- I just have.
- Quite so, my dear.

475
00:31:56,869 --> 00:31:58,812
- Oh, may I present Miss Lee?
- How do you do?

476
00:31:58,843 --> 00:31:59,893
- Miss Shaw...
- Hi.

477
00:31:59,937 --> 00:32:01,514
- Mr...
- Malone. How do you do?

478
00:32:01,614 --> 00:32:04,072
- How do you do.
- A pleasure, I'm ever so sure.

479
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,479
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

480
00:32:06,696 --> 00:32:09,531
Come sit down my dear,
we're having a jolly time.

481
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:11,166
Lady Beekman...

482
00:32:11,167 --> 00:32:14,555
...that's the most beautiful jewelry
I've ever seen in my whole life.

483
00:32:14,619 --> 00:32:17,748
Oh, hmmm, I'm quite
proud of the earrings.

484
00:32:17,749 --> 00:32:21,205
Heirlooms, you know.
Been in the family for ages.

485
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,733
You'd never know it.
They look just like new.

486
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:26,894
Oh, quite...

487
00:32:26,896 --> 00:32:31,133
You might be interested in my tiara.
I always carry it with me.

488
00:32:31,347 --> 00:32:33,589
Afraid to leave it in the state room.

489
00:32:33,808 --> 00:32:35,396
And you're not afraid
to show it to Lorelei?

490
00:32:35,397 --> 00:32:39,727
Yes, stop. Lady Beekman
won't know you're teasing.

491
00:32:40,898 --> 00:32:45,727
Look! Did you ever?
Anywhere, anything like it?

492
00:32:45,946 --> 00:32:49,529
All blue stones.
Cozy little job, what?

493
00:32:49,783 --> 00:32:53,235
- May I just hold it for a minute?
- Of course.

494
00:32:55,331 --> 00:32:56,863
How do you put
it around you neck

495
00:32:56,864 --> 00:32:59,245
You don't, lovie,
it goes on your head.

496
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,117
You must think I
was born yesterday.

497
00:33:02,118 --> 00:33:05,498
Oh, sometimes, there's no
other possible explanation.

498
00:33:05,758 --> 00:33:10,965
No, no, my dear. She's quite right.
Like so. It's a tiara.

499
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,510
You do wear it on your head!

500
00:33:13,511 --> 00:33:17,516
I just love finding new
places to wear diamonds.

501
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,929
There's the music.
You'll excuse me, my dear.

502
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,810
Miss Lee has promised
me this next dance.

503
00:33:22,026 --> 00:33:23,351
We've got to dress
for dinner now.

504
00:33:23,352 --> 00:33:25,359
- But it's only...
- We must go, Francis.

505
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:28,240
Oh, well, all right. Au revoir.

506
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:31,652
A very pleasant au revoir to you.

507
00:33:32,536 --> 00:33:35,537
My tiara. Thank you.

508
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:37,586
Poor fella.

509
00:33:37,587 --> 00:33:40,710
Two-to-one she keeps him locked
in her closet, for the rest of the trip.

510
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,834
- Listen, I'd be grateful if she did.
- I think he's cute.

511
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:48,520
Except the point, you know very well
what I mean. You and that..

512
00:33:48,521 --> 00:33:50,881
What are you doing?

513
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,557
Just testing.

514
00:33:52,557 --> 00:33:55,067
Wonder what I'll wear
it with when I...

515
00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:56,679
How does it look?

516
00:33:56,896 --> 00:33:59,813
Exactly like trouble.

517
00:34:06,447 --> 00:34:08,084
I told the coalition leader.

518
00:34:08,085 --> 00:34:11,738
That we need a man who can
do something about...

519
00:34:15,123 --> 00:34:17,911
Finish your story, dear.

520
00:34:38,064 --> 00:34:39,237
Your table, madame.

521
00:34:39,481 --> 00:34:40,287
Good evening!

522
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:43,921
Miss Lee and Miss Shaw.
This is Mr. Crossley.

523
00:34:43,922 --> 00:34:45,735
Mr. Franklin. Mr...

524
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:49,230
- Mason. How do you do?
- Mr. Brooks. How do you do?

525
00:34:49,491 --> 00:34:50,487
How do you do?

526
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:52,356
Isn't Mr. Henry
Spofford III here?

527
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:54,285
Not yet, but I believe
this is his chair.

528
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,267
You're here, Miss Lee.

529
00:34:56,268 --> 00:34:57,808
Miss Shaw,
you're over here.

530
00:34:57,809 --> 00:34:58,668
Thank you.

531
00:34:58,747 --> 00:35:00,906
Pardon me,
my girlfriend's to shy to ask.

532
00:35:00,907 --> 00:35:03,540
- But could she please have your seat?
- But of course.

533
00:35:03,757 --> 00:35:06,083
She gets sick if she rides backwards.

534
00:35:06,302 --> 00:35:09,256
- I'm sorry.
- Not at all.

535
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:14,168
How's it happened that
we are at the same table?

536
00:35:14,169 --> 00:35:16,560
This is the seat they
assigned me, Lady.

537
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:18,164
How much said it cost you?

538
00:35:18,165 --> 00:35:20,762
I can't tell you.
You'd get too conceited.

539
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,815
You're Mr. Franklin, aren't you?
Are you enjoying your trip?

540
00:35:24,028 --> 00:35:26,357
- How many times have you crossed?
- This is my...

541
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:28,760
- Don't you feel a loner on a big ocean?
- Well I...

542
00:35:28,817 --> 00:35:30,888
I just adore conversation,
don't you?

543
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:32,842
- I certainly...
- Pardon, monsieur.

544
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,905
- Mademoiselle, Mr. Spofford is here.
- Oh.

545
00:35:35,976 --> 00:35:37,044
Dorothy.

546
00:35:37,045 --> 00:35:38,519
Pardon me for whispering.

547
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,568
Now, please, try to
make a good impression.

548
00:35:40,713 --> 00:35:41,876
Okay.

549
00:35:42,048 --> 00:35:46,793
Right this way, Sir.
Mr. Henry Spofford.

550
00:35:47,762 --> 00:35:49,554
- Hello.
- Hello.

551
00:35:49,723 --> 00:35:51,846
Hello. Hello.

552
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:55,351
Well, Mr. Spofford,
are you traveling by yourself?

553
00:35:55,562 --> 00:35:58,682
No, I've got a valet,
a tutor and a trainer.

554
00:35:58,941 --> 00:35:59,813
Well...

555
00:35:59,814 --> 00:36:01,923
...pardon my saying so
and all...

556
00:36:01,923 --> 00:36:03,521
.. but having heard
so much about you...

557
00:36:03,522 --> 00:36:05,559
...I expected you to be much older.

558
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:09,945
I'm old enough to appreciate
a good-looking girl, when I see one.

559
00:36:10,161 --> 00:36:13,530
This promises to be quite a trip.

560
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:17,241
Personally, I don't intend
to miss a meal.

561
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:19,750
How am I doing?

562
00:36:26,553 --> 00:36:27,881
Hey, there's a place over there.

563
00:36:27,882 --> 00:36:29,837
Oh, Ernie, will you
get us some cigarettes?

564
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:31,215
Sure.

565
00:36:36,021 --> 00:36:40,434
I can't get over that passenger list.
Calling a young boy "mister."

566
00:36:40,487 --> 00:36:44,403
A girl could waste a whole trip to Europe,
if she trusted that passenger list.

567
00:36:44,421 --> 00:36:46,763
Think we'd better give up
the whole idea, huh?

568
00:36:46,815 --> 00:36:50,047
Believe if 16 or 17,
you could marry him in Tennessee.

569
00:36:50,096 --> 00:36:52,288
Seemed a good idea
to bring some drinks.

570
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:55,122
- Here your cigarettes.
- You're a dear good boy.

571
00:36:55,334 --> 00:36:58,161
I've been wondering,
what's your line, Mr. Malone?

572
00:36:58,162 --> 00:36:59,496
My line?

573
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:01,107
Well, my most effective one...

574
00:37:01,124 --> 00:37:04,630
...is to tell a girl that she has hair
like a tortured midnight...

575
00:37:04,885 --> 00:37:08,135
...lips like a red couch
in an ivory palace...

576
00:37:08,347 --> 00:37:11,353
...and I'm lonely and
starved for affection.

577
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,590
Then I generally
burst into tears.

578
00:37:13,811 --> 00:37:16,682
- Very seldom works.
- You idiot.

579
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:18,788
No, I mean, what do
you do for a living?

580
00:37:18,789 --> 00:37:21,318
Oh, that kind of a line.

581
00:37:21,527 --> 00:37:22,381
Nothing, I'm afraid.

582
00:37:22,382 --> 00:37:25,274
Just clip coupons and live
off the fat of the land.

583
00:37:25,673 --> 00:37:30,243
- Coupons. That's like money, isn't it?
- Very similar.

584
00:37:30,454 --> 00:37:32,824
I'm so pleased Dorothy's
taken an interest in you.

585
00:37:32,825 --> 00:37:35,579
I mean she's never been
interested in anyone worthwhile.

586
00:37:35,793 --> 00:37:36,955
No taste, hey?

587
00:37:37,169 --> 00:37:40,087
No, I'm a hobo collector.
I might find room for you.

588
00:37:40,297 --> 00:37:43,797
- She's joking, Mr. Malone.
- I hope not, I'm kind of counting on it.

589
00:37:43,909 --> 00:37:46,206
Some people don't catch
on to Dorothy's jokes.

590
00:37:46,207 --> 00:37:48,813
- I'm gonna try.
- That's good.

591
00:37:48,984 --> 00:37:52,885
Dorothy is the best and loyalest
friend a girl ever had.

592
00:37:53,103 --> 00:37:57,516
She'll make some man a wonderful wife.
You'll find out.

593
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,853
- Well, I've got to be going.
- Going? Where?

594
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:04,902
Don't worry about me.
I'm only concerned about you two.

595
00:38:05,156 --> 00:38:07,128
There's a wonderful moon out tonight.

596
00:38:07,258 --> 00:38:09,075
Well, well, well, there you are.

597
00:38:09,076 --> 00:38:10,892
I say, Miss Lee,
will you dance with me?

598
00:38:10,893 --> 00:38:12,618
I should be jolly well
pleased if you will.

599
00:38:12,696 --> 00:38:14,325
Thank you ever so, I'd love to.

600
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:17,014
That is, if you hadn't asked me,
I was going to ask you.

601
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:21,755
Really? Well, by Jove!
I just say...
I say, will you excuse us?

602
00:38:27,719 --> 00:38:30,130
Oh Ernie, do you
remember last night?

603
00:38:30,131 --> 00:38:31,515
Very well.

604
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:35,427
No, I mean when we were talking
about the moon.

605
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:39,182
You said it reminded you of a moon
you've seen in Coney Island.

606
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:41,939
Ah. Could have been the same one. Why?

607
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:44,313
I remember then I was wondering...

608
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:48,446
...what a rich young man like you
were doing in Coney Island.

609
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:49,650
Oh, well...

610
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:54,705
I rather thought you'd be
in Bermuda or Palm Beach.

611
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:08,522
Wonder if I go in and break that up.

612
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:14,136
They're just dancing... out in public.
Can't make much of a case out of that.

613
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:16,603
You sound like a detective.

614
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:21,394
C'mon. Let's go find our moon
and forget about your girlfriend.

615
00:39:21,612 --> 00:39:24,614
Anyway I'd probably get in trouble
if I pushed Piggy overboard.

616
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:26,740
Not with me.

617
00:39:26,952 --> 00:39:30,403
Anyway, why blame Piggy?
It's not all his fault.

618
00:39:30,664 --> 00:39:32,704
No, I...

619
00:39:33,041 --> 00:39:36,126
Just what did you mean
by that remark?

620
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:40,320
Let's say I can't figure out
how two girls can be so different...

621
00:39:40,321 --> 00:39:41,922
...and be such good friends.

622
00:39:42,134 --> 00:39:44,277
Now listen, Malone.
Let's get this straight.

623
00:39:44,278 --> 00:39:47,377
Nobody talks about
Lorelei but me.

624
00:39:47,598 --> 00:39:51,216
She's quite a girl.
You just don't know her.

625
00:39:54,231 --> 00:39:58,359
You don't mind
if I like you better, do you?

626
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:06,519
- We settled that quarrel in a hurry.
- Now what do we talk about?

627
00:40:06,743 --> 00:40:08,731
Let's talk about you.

628
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:12,436
For the past hour I've been thinking.

629
00:40:13,466 --> 00:40:15,975
Thinking about doing something.

630
00:40:16,325 --> 00:40:20,421
What have you been
thinking, Mr. Malone?

631
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:58,789
...Basha.

632
00:40:58,855 --> 00:41:00,998
Aren't you clever, Piggy!

633
00:41:01,086 --> 00:41:02,699
You see, that means:

634
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:06,038
"Come to my Bashaand I'll give you
my all coconut shells."

635
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:07,939
And you see, the natives believe...

636
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,713
...coconut shells ward off the
snakes, ever what.

637
00:41:10,787 --> 00:41:13,844
Africa must be fascinating.

638
00:41:14,064 --> 00:41:15,139
Gee, Piggy.

639
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:19,033
A girl like I
almost never gets to meet
a really interesting man.

640
00:41:19,285 --> 00:41:23,692
- Sometimes my brain gets real starved.
- Poor little thing.

641
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:28,880
It's a terrible thing to be lonesome,
especially in the middle of a crowd.

642
00:41:29,002 --> 00:41:30,306
Do you know what I mean?

643
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,996
You'll never be lonesome again.
You leave it to Piggy.

644
00:41:34,877 --> 00:41:37,534
Excuse me Piggy, I've
got to see Lorelei alone.

645
00:41:37,535 --> 00:41:39,983
Certainly, certainly, shall
I wait in the next room?

646
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:42,771
If you like. We're expecting
Lady Beekman for tea.

647
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:45,190
- Lady Beekman? Here?
- Yes.

648
00:41:45,191 --> 00:41:46,834
Oh, I just remembered,
I have another appointment.

649
00:41:46,964 --> 00:41:52,595
I'd better pop off. Well, toodle-loo,
chin-chin and all that rot, you know?

650
00:41:53,569 --> 00:41:55,629
That was very mean of you!
I would never inter...

651
00:41:55,653 --> 00:41:57,576
Now, you shut up and
sit down and listen to me...

652
00:41:57,577 --> 00:41:58,831
...because you're
in a jam, honey.

653
00:41:58,942 --> 00:42:00,018
Me? Why?

654
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,730
What were you and
Piggy doing in here...

655
00:42:01,732 --> 00:42:03,696
...before he started
barking like a seal?

656
00:42:03,909 --> 00:42:05,624
He wasn't barking,
that's Swahili.

657
00:42:05,625 --> 00:42:08,156
No, no, before that.
Now, think hard.

658
00:42:08,379 --> 00:42:11,018
Was there anything that would look
incriminating in a photograph?

659
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:12,614
Something you wouldn't
want Mr. Esmond to see?

660
00:42:12,694 --> 00:42:17,482
- Why, no... My goodness, yes!
- What?

661
00:42:18,246 --> 00:42:21,204
Piggy was telling me
about South Africa.

662
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,418
It's very dangerous there.

663
00:42:23,482 --> 00:42:26,164
Practically, full of
snakes called pythons.

664
00:42:26,165 --> 00:42:30,555
And it seems a python
can grab a goat...

665
00:42:30,786 --> 00:42:34,451
...and kill it
by just squeezing it to death.

666
00:42:34,649 --> 00:42:37,354
- Get to the point.
- That's all.

667
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:40,156
What's incriminating about that?

668
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:44,653
Well, Piggy was being the python,
and I was a goat.

669
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,112
Oh, Lorelei!

670
00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:48,641
Don't worry!

671
00:42:48,642 --> 00:42:50,970
Piggy won't tell anyone
he was being the python!

672
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:52,885
He won't have to.

673
00:42:52,886 --> 00:42:55,995
Because just about the time
Piggy was squeezing the goat...

674
00:42:56,213 --> 00:42:59,414
...Mr. Ernie Malone was taking
pictures right through that porthole.

675
00:42:59,536 --> 00:43:04,647
- Whatever for?
- The National Geographic magazine.

676
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:09,339
Oh, wake up, honey.
Mr. Malone has foxed us.

677
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,386
He's been shining up to me
so he can keep tabs on you.

678
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:17,548
I'll bet you anything he's a private
detective hired by Mr. Esmond.

679
00:43:17,638 --> 00:43:21,841
Oh, Gus is jealous
without pictures.

680
00:43:21,842 --> 00:43:25,030
If he sees that one, he will
be absolutely unreasonable.

681
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:27,741
Yes, he will.

682
00:43:27,884 --> 00:43:31,451
I was going to crack Malone's head in,
but I thought better of it.

683
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:33,178
What do you mean, better?

684
00:43:33,276 --> 00:43:36,005
We'll have a better chance of
getting those pictures back...

685
00:43:36,006 --> 00:43:37,326
...if he doesn't know
we're on to him.

686
00:43:37,327 --> 00:43:38,393
I'll get them.

687
00:43:38,498 --> 00:43:40,212
- How?
- He's a man, isn't he?

688
00:43:40,427 --> 00:43:43,554
No, charm won't work.
He's too smart for that.

689
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:47,970
- And he was such a doll last night.
- Oh, Dorothy!

690
00:43:48,073 --> 00:43:52,790
Boy, will I tell that stinker off
when we get those pictures back!

691
00:43:52,895 --> 00:43:57,402
- The question is, how do we do that?
- Well...

692
00:43:57,472 --> 00:43:59,876
The simplest way
is to swipe them.

693
00:43:59,877 --> 00:44:03,569
C'mon, we'll get our
warpaint on and go to work.

694
00:44:43,515 --> 00:44:47,809
- By the way, where's Lorelei tonight?
- You sound interested.

695
00:44:47,873 --> 00:44:51,415
I am, but not in her.

696
00:44:51,627 --> 00:44:55,311
If you are interested,
I know where we could find her.

697
00:44:55,465 --> 00:44:58,548
I was just asking a question.

698
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:22,361
That's all.

699
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:50,404
Hello.

700
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:54,063
Mr. Spofford, will you
please give me a hand.

701
00:45:54,064 --> 00:45:55,480
I'm sort of stuck.

702
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:58,510
- Are you a burglar?
- Heavens, no!

703
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:01,459
The steward locked me in.
I was waiting for a friend.

704
00:46:01,533 --> 00:46:03,619
Why didn't you ring for him?

705
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:06,170
I didn't think of it.
Isn't that silly?

706
00:46:06,672 --> 00:46:09,720
If you're a burglar
and I helped you escape.

707
00:46:09,745 --> 00:46:12,412
Please, help me
before somebody comes along.

708
00:46:12,628 --> 00:46:13,696
I'm thinking.

709
00:46:13,696 --> 00:46:15,944
All right.
I'll help you.

710
00:46:15,945 --> 00:46:17,554
I'll help you for two reasons.

711
00:46:17,637 --> 00:46:20,091
Never mind the reasons. Just help me.

712
00:46:20,302 --> 00:46:23,747
The first reason is, I'm too young
to be sent to jail.

713
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:28,969
The second reason is, you've got
a lot of animal magnetism.

714
00:46:31,315 --> 00:46:34,566
Look, someone's coming.

715
00:46:36,988 --> 00:46:38,691
Oh dear, what'll I do?

716
00:46:38,692 --> 00:46:42,493
Quick, hold this
around your neck, tight.

717
00:46:50,168 --> 00:46:50,991
Good evening.

718
00:46:51,064 --> 00:46:55,365
I say, whatever are you
doing up there?

719
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:58,802
I just want to see the view
from here, it's better.

720
00:46:58,930 --> 00:46:59,843
Quite so.

721
00:47:00,078 --> 00:47:01,935
Are you feeling well, my dear?

722
00:47:02,042 --> 00:47:05,322
Yes, thank you ever so,
except for being so cold...

723
00:47:05,403 --> 00:47:07,008
...I must have caught a chill.

724
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:10,893
- What say we get a spot of sherry?
- Oh, no, I can't.

725
00:47:11,107 --> 00:47:13,648
Sherry's the best thing
if a cold is coming on.

726
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:14,789
Honest, I couldn't.

727
00:47:15,025 --> 00:47:17,193
Well, you do look a little
bit flushed, my dear.

728
00:47:17,194 --> 00:47:18,316
Let me feel your pulse.

729
00:47:18,348 --> 00:47:19,858
No, no, please, don't...

730
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:24,142
No cause for alarm, my dear.
It's purely medical.

731
00:47:24,247 --> 00:47:29,027
- There's no fever, at any rate.
- I'm all right, I'm fine.

732
00:47:29,165 --> 00:47:32,104
- Such a little flowery hand.
- Please, put that back.

733
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:38,136
So sweet, so tiny,
and yet it can hold a human heart.

734
00:47:38,344 --> 00:47:40,670
- Stop that!
- Beg your pardon?

735
00:47:40,889 --> 00:47:43,020
Well I... Why...

736
00:47:43,183 --> 00:47:46,660
- Laryngitis, I guess.
- There's no doubt about it.

737
00:47:46,782 --> 00:47:49,219
Piggy, I'd better have
some of that sherry.

738
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,350
Will you get me some?

739
00:47:50,353 --> 00:47:52,150
I fly on the wings of Mercury.

740
00:47:52,281 --> 00:47:56,654
- Just hurry up.
- All right, my dear.

741
00:47:59,584 --> 00:48:02,695
How can you stand that
doddering old wolf?

742
00:48:02,696 --> 00:48:05,154
Can't you see his intentions
are not honorable.

743
00:48:05,258 --> 00:48:09,038
For heaven's sakes,
get me out of here!

744
00:48:13,605 --> 00:48:16,604
Help me over here.

745
00:48:16,955 --> 00:48:18,625
Wait a minute.

746
00:48:18,626 --> 00:48:20,344
What do you mean
you're all bruised?

747
00:48:20,345 --> 00:48:22,312
Malone's been here with
me the whole time.

748
00:48:22,371 --> 00:48:24,529
Mr. Spofford pulled me too hard.

749
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:26,290
Mr. Spofford?

750
00:48:26,291 --> 00:48:29,084
Look, honey, never mind the game.
Did you get the pictures?

751
00:48:29,214 --> 00:48:31,396
- No they weren't there.
- Are you sure?

752
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:34,773
Absolutely, I looked everywhere.
And they are in the camera shop either...

753
00:48:34,873 --> 00:48:35,803
...'cause I went in and asked.

754
00:48:35,852 --> 00:48:40,242
- Then he's got them in his pockets.
- He must have, darn it!

755
00:48:40,315 --> 00:48:42,305
Of course,
he wouldn't bother to hide them...

756
00:48:42,405 --> 00:48:44,596
...as long as he thinks
we're buying his act...

757
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,182
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Listen...

758
00:48:47,183 --> 00:48:50,252
...order dinner for three
in our cabin and get some drinks.

759
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:52,783
I'll have him here in about 10 minutes.

760
00:48:53,035 --> 00:48:55,260
If we can't empty his pockets
between us...

761
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:57,208
...we're not worthy
of the name women.

762
00:48:57,239 --> 00:48:59,332
I'll have everything ready.

763
00:49:11,497 --> 00:49:12,817
He'll be here in a minute.

764
00:49:12,818 --> 00:49:15,480
I sent him for some cigarettes.
You have the drinks ready?

765
00:49:15,556 --> 00:49:16,900
Almost ready.

766
00:49:17,235 --> 00:49:19,100
This room's like an oven.

767
00:49:19,101 --> 00:49:21,156
I know.
Let's turn some of the heat off.

768
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,042
Leave it alone, dear.

769
00:49:23,181 --> 00:49:25,828
But it's hot, why don't...

770
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:30,447
Oh, for him. You know,
sometimes your brain amazes me.

771
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:34,097
Thank you. Remember, our drink
is just water and bitters, so...

772
00:49:34,098 --> 00:49:36,157
...don't make any remarks.

773
00:49:36,337 --> 00:49:38,153
What are you doing with that one?

774
00:49:38,348 --> 00:49:42,297
This is his. Do you think three
sleeping pills are enough?

775
00:49:42,567 --> 00:49:43,813
Three's quite a lot.

776
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,322
That's pretty potent stuff.

777
00:49:45,501 --> 00:49:48,769
If a thing's worth doing,
it's worth doing well.

778
00:49:49,857 --> 00:49:52,565
Here we go.

779
00:49:54,874 --> 00:49:55,974
Come in.

780
00:49:56,055 --> 00:49:57,937
- Here are your cigarettes.
- Thanks.

781
00:49:58,026 --> 00:50:00,149
- Hi, Miss Lee.
- Good evening, Mr. Malone.

782
00:50:00,061 --> 00:50:01,997
- I got cocktails all ready.
- Good.

783
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:03,226
Make yourself at home.

784
00:50:03,227 --> 00:50:05,915
Say, you girls know
it's hot in here.

785
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:07,068
Must be 110.

786
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:10,017
Yes, it is a little warm, but
Lorelei's afraid of catching cold.

787
00:50:10,081 --> 00:50:11,564
Got a touch of laryngitis.

788
00:50:11,565 --> 00:50:13,632
Here your are Mr. Malone,
specialty of the house.

789
00:50:13,652 --> 00:50:16,000
- Thank you!
- That's quite a cocktail.

790
00:50:16,007 --> 00:50:19,262
It's very mild. Let's drink a toast.
Do you know this one?

791
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:24,074
<i>There was an old fellow named Sidney
Who drank till he ruined a kidney</i>

792
00:50:24,123 --> 00:50:28,012
<i>It shriveled and shrank
But he drank and he drank</i>

793
00:50:28,231 --> 00:50:30,603
<i>He had fun doing it, didn't he?</i>

794
00:50:30,817 --> 00:50:34,981
- It's appetizing.
- I know another one. Bottoms up.

795
00:50:44,048 --> 00:50:46,506
He looks like he's going to explode.

796
00:50:46,782 --> 00:50:48,868
What are you girls made of?

797
00:50:48,869 --> 00:50:50,010
What was that?

798
00:50:50,011 --> 00:50:53,005
Just equal parts of scotch,
vodka, brandy and gin.

799
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,464
Here, try this.

800
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:03,803
- That wasn't water!
- No, it was straight vodka.

801
00:51:03,913 --> 00:51:04,860
Do you want some more?

802
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:05,709
No.

803
00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:08,225
What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?

804
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:09,101
I'm burning up.

805
00:51:09,102 --> 00:51:11,775
I know what.
Let's take off your coat.

806
00:51:12,028 --> 00:51:16,322
Yes, you'll feel a lot better.
You'll cool off. Here I'll help.

807
00:51:16,533 --> 00:51:20,696
Now, you just sit down there.
Excuse me a minute.

808
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:25,449
- Any luck?
- Not so far.

809
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:29,083
Be sure you check the inside pocket.

810
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:31,870
- It's not in here.
- It's not in his coat.

811
00:51:32,048 --> 00:51:33,108
Darn it.

812
00:51:33,109 --> 00:51:34,818
There's one other
place it could be.

813
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:36,657
- Where?
- His pants.

814
00:51:36,931 --> 00:51:39,840
- We'll only have to get those too.
- Do I have to get it alone?

815
00:51:39,905 --> 00:51:42,153
No, I think two heads
are better than one.

816
00:51:42,154 --> 00:51:43,433
I suppose so.

817
00:51:43,499 --> 00:51:45,356
It's ticklish business anyway.
I'll look at it.

818
00:51:45,404 --> 00:51:47,269
C'mon, we'll stick together.

819
00:51:47,864 --> 00:51:50,667
Say, you know, I nearly went
to sleep, sitting here.

820
00:51:50,668 --> 00:51:52,596
You suppose you could
turn that heat down?

821
00:51:52,681 --> 00:51:54,318
You know what I think he needs,
a good glass of water.

822
00:51:54,806 --> 00:51:56,345
- Don't you, honey?
- Yes, indeed.

823
00:51:56,394 --> 00:51:58,655
I'd like some water,
but it's this heat, I can't...

824
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,903
Nice glass of water, yes...

825
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:02,864
Look out!

826
00:52:03,601 --> 00:52:05,451
Your pants are soaked!

827
00:52:05,452 --> 00:52:08,284
We can't leave him here
in wet pants, can we?

828
00:52:08,376 --> 00:52:10,062
I'll put them up
under the hair dryer.

829
00:52:10,086 --> 00:52:12,114
No, no, no, like I'm alright,
I'll just go and change.

830
00:52:12,133 --> 00:52:14,209
Don't be silly.
We wouldn't take many...

831
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:15,985
No, oh no, no!
Look this is not...

832
00:52:16,109 --> 00:52:18,093
I am not gonna catch a cold!
There is not...

833
00:52:18,193 --> 00:52:20,477
What kind of a dinner party is this?

834
00:52:21,851 --> 00:52:23,227
Pardonnez moi!

835
00:52:23,436 --> 00:52:26,354
Francois, you're just in time.
Get something to put on him.

836
00:52:26,564 --> 00:52:28,487
Mr. Malone doesn't feel very well.

837
00:52:28,488 --> 00:52:30,894
You know I think you'd better
go to you room and lie down.

838
00:52:31,111 --> 00:52:32,938
I feel like lying
down for a month.

839
00:52:32,999 --> 00:52:35,160
- Qu'est-ce qu'il y a, monsieur?
- Here, put this on.

840
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:38,449
Francois'll help you.

841
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:40,761
It's not fair, you know.
Two against one...

842
00:52:40,762 --> 00:52:42,383
- Oui, monsieur
- ...to take a man's pants...

843
00:52:42,384 --> 00:52:43,903
Je suis d'accord, monsieur...

844
00:52:49,881 --> 00:52:53,131
- I don't think it's here.
- It must be.

845
00:52:55,178 --> 00:52:57,883
I've got it! I've got it!

846
00:52:59,015 --> 00:53:03,677
Here. $2.20.
Your negatives and positive prints.

847
00:53:03,878 --> 00:53:08,706
And may I say, in the immortal words
of my countrymen, "Ooh, la, la!"

848
00:53:08,942 --> 00:53:11,434
- Thank you ever so.
- Ah, plaisir, mademoiselle Lorelei.

849
00:53:11,654 --> 00:53:13,113
Hi. Remember me?

850
00:53:13,364 --> 00:53:16,282
Why, yes. You're one of
the Olympic athletes, aren't you?

851
00:53:16,392 --> 00:53:19,363
One of them? Sister, I'm the only
4-letter man on the team.

852
00:53:19,479 --> 00:53:21,126
I should think you'd
be ashamed to admit it.

853
00:53:21,127 --> 00:53:24,573
- What...
- No, don't say another word.

854
00:53:26,499 --> 00:53:29,326
My word! By George! I must say...

855
00:53:29,327 --> 00:53:33,005
This is the most contemptible bit
of impudence I've ever encountered.

856
00:53:33,218 --> 00:53:36,021
The idea of photographing innocent
people through a porthole!

857
00:53:36,022 --> 00:53:39,007
Why, it's absolute
invasion of privacy.

858
00:53:39,092 --> 00:53:41,708
Just imagine, some newspaper
getting a hold of it.

859
00:53:41,709 --> 00:53:45,014
Lady Beekman would never believe
you were just being a snake.

860
00:53:45,231 --> 00:53:47,235
I think I'd better
sit down a moment.

861
00:53:47,236 --> 00:53:50,474
Are you sure, my dear, there's
no more of these things about?

862
00:53:50,737 --> 00:53:53,607
Positive, Piggy. Do you feel better?

863
00:53:53,823 --> 00:53:56,300
You little angel,
you don't even know that...

864
00:53:56,373 --> 00:53:58,186
...there is a certain
type of girl who would...

865
00:53:58,287 --> 00:54:00,109
...take advantage
of a thing like this.

866
00:54:01,164 --> 00:54:04,450
Gee, you'd have to be
a terrible girl to be mean...

867
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:08,292
...to a sweet, intelligent,
generous man like you, Piggy.

868
00:54:08,388 --> 00:54:09,870
My dear, my dear...

869
00:54:09,962 --> 00:54:12,836
...you must let me do something
for you to show my gratitude.

870
00:54:13,135 --> 00:54:17,798
- Oh, thank you ever so!
- May I, may I kiss your hand?

871
00:54:18,057 --> 00:54:21,324
I always say, a kiss on the hand
might feel very good...

872
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:23,481
...but a diamond tiara lasts forever.

873
00:54:23,495 --> 00:54:24,610
A diamond tiara?

874
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:26,837
Yes, Lady Beekman's.
I'd just love to have it.

875
00:54:26,857 --> 00:54:28,196
- Good gracious.
- What's the matter?

876
00:54:28,232 --> 00:54:31,616
Oh nothing, nothing, but,
wouldn't you rather have some furs...

877
00:54:31,662 --> 00:54:34,772
Or a race horse?
Or a motor-board?

878
00:54:34,991 --> 00:54:36,022
No, thank you.

879
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,988
Well, it should be very difficult
for me to explain to Lady Beekman...

880
00:54:38,989 --> 00:54:40,959
...that I'd given it away her jewels.

881
00:54:41,164 --> 00:54:44,733
You're so clever, Piggy.
You could, if you put your mind to it.

882
00:54:44,853 --> 00:54:47,791
- Do you really think so?
- Of course I do.

883
00:54:48,005 --> 00:54:50,702
And besides, it's only fair
I should have her tiara.

884
00:54:50,703 --> 00:54:54,293
Because after all, she has you.

885
00:54:54,512 --> 00:54:58,282
- My dear, my dear, my very dear!
- Let's get it right now.

886
00:54:58,357 --> 00:55:02,183
Anything you say,
my dear, anything you say.

887
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,411
- Keep an eye on the door.
- Oui, monsieur.

888
00:55:34,804 --> 00:55:38,849
All right, Pierre.
Take this thing back to my cabin.

889
00:55:39,058 --> 00:55:45,145
I'm gonna stay here.
Here's the microphone and a dividend.

890
00:55:45,358 --> 00:55:47,397
Merci, monsieur.

891
00:55:48,569 --> 00:55:51,440
- And leave the door open, Pierre.
- Oui, monsieur.

892
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:58,365
Lorelei, they're coming...
How did you get in here?

893
00:55:58,717 --> 00:56:00,085
Came in through that door.

894
00:56:00,086 --> 00:56:02,418
- I've been waiting...
- Still snooping around, huh?

895
00:56:02,533 --> 00:56:03,566
That's right.

896
00:56:03,567 --> 00:56:04,977
But it has nothing
to do with you.

897
00:56:04,978 --> 00:56:06,589
I'm being paid to watch
that blond bandit...

898
00:56:06,671 --> 00:56:09,162
I'd sure hate to have your job.

899
00:56:09,424 --> 00:56:10,287
Maybe you're right.

900
00:56:10,288 --> 00:56:12,945
Checking up on people is
messy work sometimes...

901
00:56:12,946 --> 00:56:14,912
...but only when those people
are doing things that...

902
00:56:15,062 --> 00:56:17,706
Doing things like
pretending to make love to a girl...

903
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:19,212
...while you spy on her friend?

904
00:56:19,435 --> 00:56:22,420
That part of it is not true.
And I waited here to tell you so.

905
00:56:22,457 --> 00:56:25,362
I wouldn't believe anything you said
if you had it tattooed on your forehead.

906
00:56:25,363 --> 00:56:28,580
- Now wait a minute, listen to me...
- Go away Sherlock, you're a wrong guy.

907
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:30,667
I'm not wrong about you
and you're gonna listen to me...

908
00:56:30,767 --> 00:56:32,739
You're only making things worse.

909
00:56:32,991 --> 00:56:34,893
All right, don't listen.
But whether you listen or not...

910
00:56:34,893 --> 00:56:35,860
...I'm gonna tell you.

911
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:38,578
Come on in, honey,
you can hear better in here.

912
00:56:38,757 --> 00:56:43,307
- Oh, am I intruding or is he leaving.
- One hopes.

913
00:56:43,918 --> 00:56:49,176
I'm leaving. But, Miss Lee,
before I go, I'm gonna tell you this.

914
00:56:49,292 --> 00:56:52,394
Because once in a while,
even a mercenary nitwit like you...

915
00:56:52,394 --> 00:56:54,237
...has a decent impulse.

916
00:56:54,255 --> 00:56:57,907
Don't let your friend here get
mixed up in any of your schemes.

917
00:56:57,916 --> 00:56:59,748
Because I'm gonna
rub your nose in them...

918
00:56:59,748 --> 00:57:03,682
,
...and I don't want
this character to get hurt on the way.

919
00:57:03,798 --> 00:57:07,433
If you've nothing more to say,
pray, scat!

920
00:57:07,552 --> 00:57:09,660
That's about all.

921
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:15,045
Honey, except for telling you
I had money, which I haven't...

922
00:57:15,289 --> 00:57:17,660
...everything else I
said to you, I meant.

923
00:57:17,661 --> 00:57:21,705
And it wasn't part
of my job either.

924
00:57:23,753 --> 00:57:25,911
Think about it.

925
00:57:30,343 --> 00:57:33,080
Why did you just stand there
and let him kiss you?

926
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,775
You want to hear something crazy?

927
00:57:35,776 --> 00:57:39,014
I think I'm falling in
love with that slob.

928
00:57:39,561 --> 00:57:42,811
Oh, you just feel that way
because he's poor.

929
00:57:43,022 --> 00:57:47,732
I hope so. Come on, let's change.
We dock in an hour.

930
00:58:20,479 --> 00:58:23,350
Pierre, we want to buy some clothes.
You know, hats, dresses.

931
00:58:23,409 --> 00:58:25,268
...des chapeaux...

932
00:58:25,443 --> 00:58:27,186
You know some good places?

933
00:58:27,361 --> 00:58:28,772
Oh, oui, autour du quai là.

934
00:58:28,851 --> 00:58:31,781
That's where we want to go first.

935
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,428
- This has been fun, hasn't it?
- Yes.

936
00:58:56,684 --> 00:59:00,764
It's the first time I've been
shopping without a man along.

937
00:59:05,932 --> 00:59:08,042
Well Pierre, you
certainly were a big help.

938
00:59:08,043 --> 00:59:09,272
Merci, mademoiselle!

939
00:59:09,362 --> 00:59:11,203
I've never spent so
much money so fast.

940
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,399
- It was a pleasure.
- There. Is that enough?

941
00:59:13,618 --> 00:59:15,321
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Merci, mademoiselle.

942
00:59:15,322 --> 00:59:17,746
- We'll be seeing you.
- Au revoir, au revoir, bon soir!

943
00:59:27,809 --> 00:59:29,040
Bonjour, mesdames.

944
00:59:29,118 --> 00:59:32,670
Bonjour mesdames. How do you do?
I am the manager. May I help you?

945
00:59:32,689 --> 00:59:34,630
Certainly, may you show me
a place to take my shoes off.

946
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:36,471
My feet are killing me.

947
00:59:36,726 --> 00:59:38,827
Dorothy, please, a lady never
admits her feet hurt.

948
00:59:39,007 --> 00:59:40,375
"VANDIOR"

949
00:59:40,563 --> 00:59:43,136
Bonjour mademoiselles.
Have your reservations?

950
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:46,608
Yes we do. It's in the name
of Mr. Augustus Esmond.

951
00:59:46,819 --> 00:59:49,146
- This is Miss Shaw, I'm Miss Lee.
- Hi.

952
00:59:49,406 --> 00:59:54,781
Oh, yes. We have been expecting you.
This way.

953
00:59:59,286 --> 00:59:59,971
Well!

954
00:59:59,972 --> 01:00:01,583
Miss Lee, Miss Shaw.

955
01:00:01,584 --> 01:00:03,810
I thought surely in all
Paris we could lose you.

956
01:00:03,907 --> 01:00:06,319
Madame, are these the persons
you were talking about?

957
01:00:06,321 --> 01:00:08,209
Yes, these are the persons.

958
01:00:08,336 --> 01:00:12,554
Oh, Lady Piggy. I mean Beekman!
What a pleasant surprise.

959
01:00:12,764 --> 01:00:14,450
Mmh, I dare say.

960
01:00:14,515 --> 01:00:16,503
You may proceed, Pritchard.

961
01:00:16,649 --> 01:00:18,551
This person is Miss Lee.

962
01:00:18,623 --> 01:00:19,494
Miss Lee...

963
01:00:19,495 --> 01:00:22,471
...I represent the Suffolk and
Greater London Insurance Company.

964
01:00:22,691 --> 01:00:24,435
Well, did you ever so!
I never buy insurance.

965
01:00:24,693 --> 01:00:27,602
So, it's Mr. Malone.
He needs it in the business he's in.

966
01:00:27,603 --> 01:00:28,929
What is all this?

967
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:30,029
Young woman...

968
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:31,637
...if you return the tiara...

969
01:00:31,637 --> 01:00:34,040
...I'm willing to forget
this squalid incident.

970
01:00:34,236 --> 01:00:36,354
Allow me to clarify, Milady.

971
01:00:36,355 --> 01:00:39,594
A Lady Beekman's tiara,
which is insured to my company,

972
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:41,355
has been reported as stolen.

973
01:00:41,369 --> 01:00:42,989
What's that got to do with us?

974
01:00:43,029 --> 01:00:45,498
We've been informed,
it's in your possession.

975
01:00:45,499 --> 01:00:46,488
Is that true?

976
01:00:46,521 --> 01:00:47,800
Absolutely not!

977
01:00:47,801 --> 01:00:49,899
Honey, why don't you let Lorelei
talk for herself.

978
01:00:49,944 --> 01:00:52,706
She'll do better than that,
she'll sue you for slander!

979
01:00:52,716 --> 01:00:55,512
Honey, tell them, go on.

980
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:57,082
- Well...
- We're waiting.

981
01:00:57,228 --> 01:00:58,806
None of your business.

982
01:00:59,021 --> 01:01:00,978
Well, I'm afraid it's very much
our business.

983
01:01:01,315 --> 01:01:03,971
Honey, just tell them you
haven't got it. Tell...

984
01:01:03,972 --> 01:01:06,476
Oh, Lorelei, you didn't!

985
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,772
I did not steal Lady Beekman's tiara.

986
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:12,046
Then perhaps you'll explain
how it happens to be in your possession?

987
01:01:12,047 --> 01:01:13,859
Suppose we say that's my affair.

988
01:01:13,913 --> 01:01:15,534
Well, that's one explanation.

989
01:01:15,535 --> 01:01:18,656
Lord Beekman knows it wasn't stolen.
Ask him.

990
01:01:18,874 --> 01:01:20,056
We've already done so, Miss Lee.

991
01:01:20,105 --> 01:01:20,992
And...

992
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:23,204
He denied knowing
anything about it...

993
01:01:23,464 --> 01:01:26,169
...and departed
for the interior of Africa.

994
01:01:26,425 --> 01:01:27,837
Piggy wouldn't do that!

995
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:32,879
Miss Lee, are you or are you not
going to give back the tiara?

996
01:01:33,152 --> 01:01:36,972
I wouldn't dream of doing it.
It's mine and I'm going to keep it.

997
01:01:37,186 --> 01:01:40,270
That remains to be seen.
Come, Pritchard.

998
01:01:40,837 --> 01:01:42,783
You'll find that
I mean business.

999
01:01:42,785 --> 01:01:46,563
Oh, really?
Then why are you wearing that hat?

1000
01:01:48,573 --> 01:01:50,779
- Honey, I want to talk to you.
- I made up my mind.

1001
01:01:51,032 --> 01:01:53,664
Look Lorelei.
The simplest way to get out of
this whole thing...

1002
01:01:53,665 --> 01:01:54,734
...is just to give it back.

1003
01:01:54,954 --> 01:01:57,512
I do not care to converse
with you, Mr. Malone.

1004
01:01:57,513 --> 01:02:00,957
We will not be in to this man,
as long as we stay in this hotel.

1005
01:02:01,212 --> 01:02:03,664
I regret, madame, you
will not stay here at all.

1006
01:02:03,665 --> 01:02:05,180
Oh, oh, what now?

1007
01:02:05,236 --> 01:02:06,742
The jig's up, Lorelei.

1008
01:02:06,743 --> 01:02:09,279
Esmond canceled your reservation
and your letter of credit.

1009
01:02:09,350 --> 01:02:12,367
- After hearing from you.
- That's right.

1010
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:15,888
I don't believe it.
Mr. Esmond wouldn't do that.

1011
01:02:16,284 --> 01:02:18,368
- Did he?
- Exactly.

1012
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:22,183
Mr. Esmond refuses
responsibility for your bills.

1013
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:25,700
It's very inconvenient, because
we've just spent all of our money.

1014
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:27,608
I'm sorry, madame.
That's not our concern.

1015
01:02:27,684 --> 01:02:29,208
C'mon, honey,
let's get out of here.

1016
01:02:29,209 --> 01:02:31,579
Anyway, I hear your plumbing is noisy.

1017
01:02:31,611 --> 01:02:34,833
Dorothy, if you need help,
I'm at the Elysée Hotel.

1018
01:02:35,037 --> 01:02:37,904
You hold your breath till I call.

1019
01:02:51,139 --> 01:02:53,097
Mademoiselle?

1020
01:03:00,274 --> 01:03:01,852

Merci.

1072
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,129
Lorelei?

- Oh, hello, there.
- Hello.

1074
01:07:17,355 --> 01:07:19,522
You remember Mr. Esmond,
don't you dear?

1075
01:07:19,548 --> 01:07:20,701
Perfectly.

1076
01:07:20,721 --> 01:07:22,463
Why not say hello, then?

1077
01:07:22,464 --> 01:07:25,068
After all,
he used to be a friend of ours.

1078
01:07:25,084 --> 01:07:26,714
Nice to see you again.

1079
01:07:26,715 --> 01:07:29,186

- Yes, indeed.

Lorelei, Lorelei wait!
Look!

1081
01:07:32,876 --> 01:07:35,025
Lorelei, I've flown
the entire Atlantic Ocean...

1082
01:07:35,035 --> 01:07:36,717
...just to talk to you,
and now you...

1083
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:39,520
Well, you might come in for a minute.
That's, if you don't mind?

1084
01:07:39,565 --> 01:07:41,741
Oh, I don't mind if you don't mind.

1085
01:07:41,860 --> 01:07:45,044
- Mr. Esmond?
- Thank you.

1086
01:07:47,007 --> 01:07:49,580
Lorelei, aren't you even gonna
say you're sorry?

1087
01:07:49,801 --> 01:07:51,170
I won't let myself.

1088
01:07:51,172 --> 01:07:53,550
I won't let myself fall
in love with a man...

1089
01:07:53,551 --> 01:07:56,089
...who won't trust me, no
matter what I might do.

1090
01:07:56,350 --> 01:07:59,850
"No matter what you..."?
Lorelei, that's being unreasonable.

1091
01:08:00,105 --> 01:08:02,062
Well, goodbye, then.

1092
01:08:02,272 --> 01:08:05,743
How can I trust you after all
Father's found out about you?

1093
01:08:05,901 --> 01:08:07,222
We're ready to dress
you, mademoiselle.

1094
01:08:07,223 --> 01:08:08,369

01:08:09,804 --> 01:08:12,612
Lorelei, I...

1096
01:08:12,826 --> 01:08:15,331
It's men like you who have made me
the way I am.

1097
01:08:15,346 --> 01:08:17,147
And if you loved me at all...

1098
01:08:17,148 --> 01:08:20,123
...you'd feel sorry for the
terrible troubles I've been through...

1099
01:08:20,134 --> 01:08:22,313
...instead of holding
them against me.

don't say another word.

1101
01:08:28,467 --> 01:08:30,461

want to get upset...

1155
01:14:27,055 --> 01:14:29,474
Hi, honey.
How'd Gus like your number?

1156
01:14:29,475 --> 01:14:32,220
He didn't applaud.
He looked kind of grim.

1157
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:34,473
Hand me my hat there
would you please.

1158
01:14:34,486 --> 01:14:38,352
He is sweet, isn't he?
I really do love Gus.

1159
01:14:38,366 --> 01:14:39,894
You do, really?

1160
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:43,941
There's no other millionaire in
the world with such a gentle disposition.

1161
01:14:44,027 --> 01:14:47,690
He never wins an argument,
always does anything I ask...

1162
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:49,456
...and he's got
the money to do it with.

1163
01:14:49,457 --> 01:14:52,737
How can I help
loving a man like that?

1164
01:14:52,956 --> 01:14:55,954
Oh, I guess so.
Let's don't talk about love.

1165
01:14:55,999 --> 01:14:58,953
It reminds me of my friend Malone,
the human ferret.

1166
01:15:00,485 --> 01:15:01,600
Deshabillé?

1167
01:15:01,606 --> 01:15:03,610
Quelle catastrophe!
Les gendarmes!

1168
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:06,176
The police are here!
They asked for you!

1169
01:15:06,176 --> 01:15:07,834
They have a warrant for your arrest.

1170
01:15:07,946 --> 01:15:09,227
They are coming now.

1171
01:15:09,248 --> 01:15:12,028
It will get in all the newspapers.
It will hurt my business.

1172
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:13,642
Quelle scandal!

1173
01:15:15,055 --> 01:15:17,207
Now will you get rid of
that jinxed tiara.

1174
01:15:17,210 --> 01:15:18,570
But Piggy gave it me...

1175
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:20,960
if I give it back,
it's like admitting I stole it.

1176
01:15:20,985 --> 01:15:23,349
Oh, keep still, honey.
You're in a strange country.

1177
01:15:23,349 --> 01:15:25,363
You can't prove
that you didn't steal it.

1178
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:28,693
Do you want to take the chance
of a couple of years in the Bastille?

1179
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:31,531
- I guess I've got to give it back.
- Where is it?

1180
01:15:31,664 --> 01:15:33,571
- In there.
- Oh, come on, let's get it.

1181
01:15:33,619 --> 01:15:38,460
- Oh, Dorothy. It's just not fair.
- No, of course not.

1182
01:15:40,965 --> 01:15:42,246
Dorothy, it's gone!

1183
01:15:42,467 --> 01:15:45,752
What? Are you sure
this is where you left it?

1184
01:15:46,012 --> 01:15:49,345
Yes. It's been stolen!
It's been stolen!

1185
01:15:50,767 --> 01:15:55,595
The cops!
Oh, sister, we really are in a jam.

1186
01:15:55,814 --> 01:15:57,853
Come on.

1187
01:15:58,241 --> 01:16:00,115
Maybe you can get out
here if I give you a boost.

1188
01:16:00,115 --> 01:16:02,238
Lorelei? It's me, Gus.

1189
01:16:02,444 --> 01:16:03,723
- Gus.
- I come to say goodbye.

1190
01:16:03,763 --> 01:16:04,652
He's your best chance.

1191
01:16:04,653 --> 01:16:06,572
Why, if he can't boost me
any higher than you can.

1192
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:07,655
Lorelei?

1193
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,244
Just a minute Gus.
Listen!

1194
01:16:09,286 --> 01:16:11,050
Either you hock some of that stuff...

1195
01:16:11,072 --> 01:16:12,951
...or get the price of the
diamond tiara out of him.

1196
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:14,966
How much do you think a
diamond tiara'll cost?

1197
01:16:14,967 --> 01:16:16,594
$15,000 at least.

1198
01:16:16,765 --> 01:16:19,300
Gee, that'll take an
hour and 45 minutes.

1199
01:16:19,301 --> 01:16:22,164
All right, you get the money
and I'll take care of the gendarmes.

1200
01:16:22,283 --> 01:16:23,288
How?

1201
01:16:23,353 --> 01:16:26,205
Never mind how. You're not the only one
around here with hidden talents.

1202
01:16:26,384 --> 01:16:29,053
- Lorelei?
- Coming!

1203
01:16:30,099 --> 01:16:31,973
You can come in now, Daddy darling.

1204
01:16:32,193 --> 01:16:35,647
Lorelei, I've made up my mind.
We're through. Through forever.

1205
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,516
Oh, but first I want
to kiss you goodbye.

1206
01:16:39,517 --> 01:16:41,438
Very well.

1207
01:16:41,654 --> 01:16:48,321
No, no. Not in front of everybody.
Come on in, Daddy darling.

1208
01:16:50,163 --> 01:16:51,751
"American vols sont ici."

1209
01:16:51,752 --> 01:16:54,374
"Venant de New York
maintenant à la porte douze."

1210
01:16:54,534 --> 01:16:56,017
This is your flight
coming now, monsieur.

1211
01:16:56,018 --> 01:16:58,318
Oh, thanks very much.

1212
01:17:05,553 --> 01:17:06,651
"Now Ici, monsieur."

1213
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:08,504
Pardonnne, monsieur.
Until you finish customs you cannot...

1214
01:17:08,505 --> 01:17:10,582
I know, I just wish to speak
with this gentleman.

1215
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:11,829
- Bien, monsieur.
- Well Malone?

1216
01:17:11,829 --> 01:17:13,595
How are you, Mr. Esmond.
Have a nice trip?

1217
01:17:13,561 --> 01:17:14,841
My son, where is he?

1218
01:17:14,842 --> 01:17:17,512
A few minutes ago, he was in the café
where the girls are working.

1219
01:17:17,732 --> 01:17:21,007
I explicitly told you on my cable
to stay with him until I arrived.

1220
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,256
- Well, he...
- Don't you know he can't be left alone...

1221
01:17:23,257 --> 01:17:25,402
...in the same city
with that blond man-trap.

1222
01:17:25,502 --> 01:17:27,111
Oh, he's perfectly safe for a while.

1223
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:30,402
Right now, the blond man-trap is in the
quatrième arrondissment night-court...

1224
01:17:30,403 --> 01:17:32,830
...getting ready to explain
a few things to the police.

1225
01:17:33,041 --> 01:17:34,342
That's much better.

1226
01:17:34,429 --> 01:17:36,855
We'll go over there as soon as
you get through this customs thing.

1227
01:17:36,870 --> 01:17:39,357
I'll be right with you.

1228
01:17:46,456 --> 01:17:49,007
I beg your pardon.

1229
01:17:49,701 --> 01:17:52,918
Well, Sir Francis Beekman.
I heard you'd gone to Africa.

1230
01:17:53,029 --> 01:17:56,032
What? What'd you say? Beekman?
No, Sir, my name is not Beekman,

1231
01:17:56,032 --> 01:17:57,568
my name's Amos Finch.

1232
01:17:57,734 --> 01:17:58,979
All right, if that's how you want it.

1233
01:17:58,993 --> 01:18:01,230
I say, don't be in such
a confounded rush.

1234
01:18:01,231 --> 01:18:03,143
Aren't you're the
chap on the boat?

1235
01:18:03,364 --> 01:18:04,396
- I am.
- I thought so.

1236
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:07,559
Er, I was just having a bit of a joke.
Of course I'm Beekman.

1237
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:09,715
- You're sure?
- Well, rather.

1238
01:18:09,717 --> 01:18:13,546
My plane leaves in an hour..
Do you know where to find Miss Lee?

1239
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:14,656
I think so.

1240
01:18:14,660 --> 01:18:17,748
Would mind giving her a message for me,
but not until after I've gone.

1241
01:18:17,822 --> 01:18:18,401
Glad to.

1242
01:18:18,563 --> 01:18:21,350
Tell her... tell her that
I had no choice in the matter.

1243
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:24,518
What I did, I had to do,
and all that sort of rot, you know.

1244
01:18:24,711 --> 01:18:26,568
She'll understand
if she knew my wife.

1245
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:30,976
And tell her... tell her I know
that money means nothing to her.

1246
01:18:31,128 --> 01:18:33,802
But I'll make it up to
her someday, somehow.

1247
01:18:33,803 --> 01:18:34,678
I'll tell her.

1248
01:18:34,895 --> 01:18:36,909
Thanks awfully, old boy.
Well, toodle-loo.

1249
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:39,474
It'll be a great favor,
by George, a great favor.

1250
01:18:39,515 --> 01:18:42,024
All right, Malone, take
me to see this young lady.

1251
01:18:42,025 --> 01:18:44,322
Yes, sir.

1252
01:18:45,201 --> 01:18:48,605
"Reprenter sentiments et si
honorablement à monsieur le president."

1253
01:18:48,663 --> 01:18:51,820
"Le mettez un terme
par un châtiment exemplaire."

1254
01:18:52,777 --> 01:18:55,457
"Faites entrer I'accusé."

1255
01:18:55,628 --> 01:18:57,543
"Faite entrer mademoiselle Lee."

1256
01:18:57,544 --> 01:19:00,171
"Mademoiselle Lorelei Lee."

1257
01:19:16,969 --> 01:19:18,509
"Mademoiselle Lee."

1258
01:19:18,510 --> 01:19:22,816
"Je veux dire la verité,
toute la verité, rien que la verité."

1259
01:19:24,141 --> 01:19:26,417
You will please swear, Miss Lee.

1260
01:19:26,418 --> 01:19:29,069
Oh, judge,
I never swear.

1261
01:19:29,241 --> 01:19:30,227
You've been asked...

1262
01:19:30,228 --> 01:19:33,828
...to swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth, nothing but the truth.

1263
01:19:33,886 --> 01:19:35,129
Will you do that?

1264
01:19:35,503 --> 01:19:38,354
Well, yeah. Thank you ever so.

1265
01:19:38,355 --> 01:19:40,342
Sit down, mademoiselle.

1266
01:19:42,522 --> 01:19:44,192
Mademoiselle Lee,
I've been requested...

1267
01:19:44,250 --> 01:19:47,223
.. to hold you for trial,
for a charge of grand larceny.

1268
01:19:47,394 --> 01:19:50,051
The complainer attest
that you have stolen...

1269
01:19:50,052 --> 01:19:53,183
...how do you say it...
a headpiece of diamond, a tiara?

1270
01:19:53,397 --> 01:19:57,312
My goodness, judge,
a girl needs a little time to think.

1271
01:19:57,568 --> 01:20:00,818
You're so much more intelligent
than poor little me.

1272
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:03,355
Won't you tell me what I ought to say?

1273
01:20:03,574 --> 01:20:08,817
- Please, answer the charge, Miss Lee.
- Yes, judge, I was going to.

1274
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:14,408
I was just thinking. It was
all a terrible misunderstanding.

1275
01:20:14,628 --> 01:20:18,792
You see, judge, sometimes life is
very hard for a girl like I.

1276
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:23,546
Especially if she happens to be pretty
like I and have blond hair.

1277
01:20:23,804 --> 01:20:27,495
We can do without the philosophy.
We have interest in the facts, only.

1278
01:20:27,551 --> 01:20:29,372
"Monsieur le President, qu'il plaît
au tribunal..."

1279
01:20:29,372 --> 01:20:31,409
Mr. Pritchard is a
little confused...

1280
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,078
...and would like to bring
up a question.

1281
01:20:33,225 --> 01:20:36,186
I can hardly blame him.
What is the question?

1282
01:20:36,441 --> 01:20:38,176
Mr. Pritchard doesn't see
very well...

1283
01:20:38,177 --> 01:20:40,220
...and would like to look at
mademoiselle Lee, more closely.

1284
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:43,982
Permission granted.

1285
01:20:47,764 --> 01:20:51,487
- Now Miss Lee, I should like ..
- Why, Mr. Pritchard, how nice to see you!

1286
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:55,208
Yes, Miss Lee...
You are Miss Lee, aren't you?

1287
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:59,615
That's just who I am, all right.
But my friends call me Lorelei.

1288
01:20:59,786 --> 01:21:02,314
I do hope you're my friend, because...

1289
01:21:02,362 --> 01:21:05,838
...I just love to have
handsome gentlemen be my friends.

1290
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:07,890
Well, my eyes are not
what they might be.

1291
01:21:08,002 --> 01:21:10,723
- Have you ever heard me sing?
- No.

1292
01:21:10,937 --> 01:21:13,671
- Are you sure?
- Oh, I've not had the pleasure.

1293
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:16,190

01:22:33,817 --> 01:22:35,977
"Asseyz vous!"

1314
01:22:38,696 --> 01:22:43,763
Now, young lady,
we're here to dispense justice.

1315
01:22:43,934 --> 01:22:48,112
Not to watch a cabaret show.
You understand me?

1316
01:22:48,242 --> 01:22:51,345
- Yes, judge.
- All right.

1317
01:22:51,623 --> 01:22:55,787
Did you or did you not steal
the diamond tiara?

1318
01:22:55,876 --> 01:22:58,580
Oh, no, sir. I did not steal it.

1319
01:22:58,768 --> 01:23:03,430
The fact is, Lady Beekman's
husband gave it to me.

1320
01:23:03,639 --> 01:23:05,212
Your Honor, I'd like to
give some information!

1321
01:23:05,213 --> 01:23:05,903
The defendant here is not...

1322
01:23:05,935 --> 01:23:08,802
"Silence!"

1323
01:23:09,486 --> 01:23:12,515
You have evidence
that affects this case?

1324
01:23:12,516 --> 01:23:14,431
- Yes, Sir, I have.
- Well, by all means.

1325
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:17,486
Your Honor, before he talks,
could I explain something?

1326
01:23:17,703 --> 01:23:18,916
Go ahead, Miss Lee.

1327
01:23:19,071 --> 01:23:24,569
Well, I have a friend named Dorothy,
and she's a really good friend.

1328
01:23:24,782 --> 01:23:29,245
And Dorothy knows I would never do
anything that was really wrong.

1329
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:34,749
- Miss Lee, do you have to say this?
- Yes, sir, I do.

1330
01:23:34,964 --> 01:23:37,473
There's a certain young
man that Dorothy likes.

1331
01:23:37,474 --> 01:23:39,932
In fact, she's very fond of him.

1332
01:23:40,062 --> 01:23:43,966
And, Dorothy would never speak
to this man again...

1333
01:23:43,999 --> 01:23:48,763
...if he ever did anything
to hurt me, Lorelei.

1334
01:23:48,978 --> 01:23:51,658
So I think this young man had
just better know that...

1335
01:23:51,828 --> 01:23:57,531
...well, well, Dorothy thinks
she's in love with him.

1336
01:23:57,619 --> 01:24:00,380
- Mr. Esmond, I resign.
- What?

1337
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:02,321
I just quit the case,
you don't owe me a dime.

1338
01:24:02,355 --> 01:24:04,112
What's got into you?
Are you out of your mind?

1339
01:24:04,127 --> 01:24:05,839
Hmmm,
but I like it that way.

1340
01:24:05,849 --> 01:24:08,052
- Judge, I've changed my mind.
- What?

1341
01:24:08,165 --> 01:24:10,349
I haven't anything to say.

1342
01:24:10,464 --> 01:24:14,389
Oh, this becomes more
and more confusing.

1343
01:24:14,471 --> 01:24:20,041
But the solution is simple.
My decision is this:

1344
01:24:20,262 --> 01:24:23,678
The property in question will be
placed in custody of this court...

1345
01:24:23,889 --> 01:24:26,927
...until its rightful owner can be
established by an affidavit...

1346
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:28,889
...from Lord Beekman himself.

1347
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:33,573
Now, Miss Lee, you will
give me the tiara.

1348
01:24:33,646 --> 01:24:35,885
But, judge, I can't.

1349
01:24:35,886 --> 01:24:38,233
If you refuse,
I must put you in prison.

1350
01:24:38,387 --> 01:24:41,889
Well, I don't refuse,
I just haven't got it. It was stolen.

1351
01:24:41,895 --> 01:24:43,033
Your Honor...

1352
01:24:43,034 --> 01:24:45,908
...I think I know where that thing
is and think I know who's got it.

1353
01:24:46,022 --> 01:24:48,973
- Who are you, by the way?
- I'm a private detective, your honor.

1354
01:24:49,054 --> 01:24:52,133
If you'll give me a couple of
policemen and wait about half an hour...

1355
01:24:52,133 --> 01:24:54,297
...I can bring the tiara
back and settle this thing.

1356
01:24:54,402 --> 01:24:57,473
Anything would be better than this.
Go with him.

1357
01:24:57,718 --> 01:24:59,820
"Accompagnez-le. Oui!"

1358
01:24:59,821 --> 01:25:03,554
"L'audience est supendue"

1359
01:25:04,937 --> 01:25:07,178
There he is.

1360
01:25:09,105 --> 01:25:11,181
"Pardon, monsieur.
Vous allez nous suivre."

1361
01:25:11,357 --> 01:25:13,231
- What's that?
- "Vous allez nous suivre."

1362
01:25:13,651 --> 01:25:15,727
What's he saying?
"Question d'arrêt, monsiuer. Allez!

1363
01:25:16,403 --> 01:25:20,068
Speak English! I don't speak...
This is outrageous! -"Mais avec nous."

1364
01:25:20,283 --> 01:25:22,573
I'm a British subject!
You'll hear about this!

1365
01:25:22,786 --> 01:25:26,387
This is positively outrageous!
Your Honor, I demand a lawyer.

1366
01:25:26,464 --> 01:25:28,187
"Que se decouvre!"
"Decouvrez vous!"

1367
01:25:28,206 --> 01:25:30,240
What?
What did you say?

1368
01:25:30,245 --> 01:25:31,776
- Good evening, your Lordship.
- Pritchard!

1369
01:25:31,786 --> 01:25:33,909
The policemen want you
to remove your hat.

1370
01:25:34,073 --> 01:25:35,296
Well, why doesn't he say so?

1371
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:37,423
What are you doing, send
for the British consulate.

1372
01:25:37,436 --> 01:25:40,132
- Meantime, I'll take this.
- Hey, give that back. - In just a second.

1373
01:25:40,146 --> 01:25:42,611
Your Honor, this is
Sir Francis Beekman.

1374
01:25:42,612 --> 01:25:45,589
And this, I believe,
is the missing tiara.

1375
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:46,983
That's private property!

1376
01:25:46,984 --> 01:25:48,977
I'm sure Miss Lee will
be glad to return it.

1377
01:25:49,130 --> 01:25:50,703
I certainly would.

1378
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:52,384
But before that happens, I believe...

1379
01:25:52,385 --> 01:25:54,531
His Honor asked
Miss Lee to give him the tiara.

1380
01:25:54,532 --> 01:25:56,478
- I did!
- I say, that isn't...

1381
01:25:56,521 --> 01:25:59,335
I wouldn't go into that,
if I were you, Mr. Finch.

1382
01:25:59,340 --> 01:26:00,824
Finch?

1383
01:26:00,827 --> 01:26:03,814
- Miss Lee.
- Thank you.

1384
01:26:06,448 --> 01:26:08,469
- Your Honor.
- Thank you.

1385
01:26:08,569 --> 01:26:09,849
"Maitre Courtier..."

1386
01:26:10,019 --> 01:26:12,059
Thank you.

1387
01:26:13,706 --> 01:26:17,209
- Monsieur Pritchard.
- Thank you. Your Lordship.

1388
01:26:17,226 --> 01:26:18,458
Thank you.

1389
01:26:19,055 --> 01:26:21,385
Case dismissed!

1390
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:24,612
But, five minutes ago
you said you would marry me.

1391
01:26:24,710 --> 01:26:26,682
But that's before Dorothy phoned me.

1392
01:26:26,683 --> 01:26:29,493
But what on earth could she say
to make you change your mind?

1393
01:26:29,598 --> 01:26:32,941
She just said everything's okay now.

1394
01:26:33,152 --> 01:26:34,431
I don't quite understand...

1395
01:26:34,432 --> 01:26:36,302
- Oh, dear.
- Well.

1396
01:26:36,332 --> 01:26:39,030
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, son.

1397
01:26:39,138 --> 01:26:41,344
I know what you're here for Father,
and I don't care.

1398
01:26:41,344 --> 01:26:43,970
I've made up my mind.
I'm gonna make her marry me.

1399
01:26:44,231 --> 01:26:46,244
Oh, bless you heart, that's wonderful.

1400
01:26:46,389 --> 01:26:48,825
- I presume this is the young lady?
- Well, yes.

1401
01:26:48,873 --> 01:26:51,432
Such a pretty little girl!
American?

1402
01:26:51,531 --> 01:26:54,446
Yes, except on my father and mother
side. They're Irish.

1403
01:26:54,512 --> 01:26:56,916
Believe me, son.
I'm delighted about this.

1404
01:26:56,917 --> 01:27:00,007
I've wanted to see you
married for a long time.

1405
01:27:00,132 --> 01:27:03,000
Anybody but that monster,
Lorelei Lee.

1406
01:27:03,056 --> 01:27:06,458
- What?
- Mr. Esmond, I am Lorelei Lee!

1407
01:27:06,473 --> 01:27:09,994
Hah, hah. Pretty early in the game
to start teasing your father-in-law.

1408
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:14,623
- What's the matter with you, Father?
- Nothing. I can take a joke.

1409
01:27:14,769 --> 01:27:17,248
What joke?
This is Lorelei.

1410
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,746
Father, this is not the sort
of thing one would joke about.

1411
01:27:19,908 --> 01:27:22,157
I don't have my
driver's license with me...

1412
01:27:22,158 --> 01:27:24,697
...but you can take my word for it.
Honest!

1413
01:27:24,804 --> 01:27:30,043
Look, that's I.
See my name?

1414
01:27:30,671 --> 01:27:32,248
Oh...

1415
01:27:32,631 --> 01:27:34,773
I'm too old for this sort of thing.

1416
01:27:34,944 --> 01:27:38,047
- Father, I don't understand.
- You don't understand?

1417
01:27:38,113 --> 01:27:39,506
How do you think I feel...

1418
01:27:39,507 --> 01:27:42,460
with thousands of Lorelei Lees
coming at me from everywhere?

1419
01:27:42,541 --> 01:27:45,851
But believe me, son, you're not
going to marry any one of them!

1420
01:27:45,906 --> 01:27:47,406
Father, I love her.

1421
01:27:47,406 --> 01:27:48,921
I love her very much.

1422
01:27:48,922 --> 01:27:49,915
I've never had a feeling...

1423
01:27:49,961 --> 01:27:55,192
Oh, shut up! Young lady,
you don't fool me one bit.

1424
01:27:55,405 --> 01:27:58,539
I'm not trying to.
But I bet I could, though.

1425
01:27:58,540 --> 01:28:00,768
No, you might convince this...

1426
01:28:00,769 --> 01:28:03,277
...jackass that you love him,
but you'll never convince me.

1427
01:28:03,382 --> 01:28:06,665
That's too bad.
Because I do love him.

1428
01:28:06,666 --> 01:28:08,789
Certainly. For his money.

1429
01:28:08,824 --> 01:28:10,631
No!
Honestly.

1430
01:28:10,720 --> 01:28:13,655
Have you got the nerve stand there
and you expect me to believe...

1431
01:28:13,656 --> 01:28:16,161
...that you don't want to marry
my son for his money?

1432
01:28:16,195 --> 01:28:17,578
It's true.

1433
01:28:17,479 --> 01:28:19,470
Then what do you
want to marry him for?

1434
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:22,897
- I want to marry him for your money.
- There!

1435
01:28:24,103 --> 01:28:25,863
Oh, Lorelei!

1436
01:28:25,896 --> 01:28:28,451
Don't you see that's why
we have to have his consent, silly.

1437
01:28:28,581 --> 01:28:31,122
Well, at least we're getting
down to brass tacks.

1438
01:28:31,123 --> 01:28:33,233
You admit that all
you're after is money.

1439
01:28:33,306 --> 01:28:37,126
No, I don't.
Aren't you funny?

1440
01:28:37,231 --> 01:28:41,499
Don't you know that a man being rich
is like a girl being pretty?

1441
01:28:41,606 --> 01:28:44,791
You might not marry a girl
just because she's pretty.

1442
01:28:44,807 --> 01:28:47,274
But my goodness,
doesn't it help?

1443
01:28:47,371 --> 01:28:48,985
And if you had a daughter...

1444
01:28:49,081 --> 01:28:51,377
...wouldn't you rather
she didn't marry a poor man?

1445
01:28:51,408 --> 01:28:53,226
- But I was just...
- You'd want her to have the most...

1446
01:28:53,226 --> 01:28:56,590
...wonderful things in the world,
and to be very happy.

1447
01:28:56,738 --> 01:28:59,654
Why is it wrong for me
to want those things?

1448
01:28:59,724 --> 01:29:02,216
Well, I concede that...

1449
01:29:02,234 --> 01:29:06,479
Say, they told me you were stupid.
You don't sound stupid to me.

1450
01:29:06,530 --> 01:29:10,738
I can be smart when it's important.
But most men don't like it.

1451
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,645
Except Gus.

1452
01:29:12,646 --> 01:29:15,061
He's always been
interested in my brains.

1453
01:29:15,094 --> 01:29:18,092
No, no, that much
of a fool he's not.

1454
01:29:18,093 --> 01:29:20,030
Father, you've
changed your mind?

1455
01:29:20,087 --> 01:29:24,080
I don't know, son, I just
don't know what to tell you.

1456
01:29:24,081 --> 01:29:26,083
Daddy?

1457
01:29:26,143 --> 01:29:29,214
No, Daddy, not you.
I guess I mean "Sonny."

1458
01:29:29,180 --> 01:29:31,992
I'd like to spend about
three minutes alone with your father.

1459
01:29:32,090 --> 01:29:34,158
- Three minutes alone.
- Run along, darling.

1460
01:29:34,158 --> 01:29:35,381
Yes, dear.

1461
01:29:35,445 --> 01:29:38,667
Now, Mr. Esmond,
about what we were speaking.

1462
01:29:38,738 --> 01:29:43,698
Well, there's a great deal
to consider. I just can't imagine...

1463
01:29:54,266 --> 01:29:57,948
Please,
take your places.

1464
01:30:10,966 --> 01:30:11,985
Remember honey...

1465
01:30:11,985 --> 01:30:14,886
...on your wedding day,
it's all right to say yes.
