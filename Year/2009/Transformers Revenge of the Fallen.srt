1
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:01,094
Earth, birthplace of the human race,

2
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:05,223
a species much like our own,

3
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,901
capable of great compassion

4
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,655
and great violence.

5
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,753
For in our quest to protect the humans,

6
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,839
a deeper revelation dawns.

7
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:33,134
Our worlds have met before.

8
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:21,890
- Newsflash from the BBC.
- Breaking news out of Shanghai.

9
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:26,019
There's been a major toxic spill
in the Shanghai factory district.

10
00:02:26,103 --> 00:02:28,230
We're staying
on top of this developing story for you.

11
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,775
We will bring you
any new information as we get it.

12
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:39,157
NEST Seahawks approaching target.

13
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,494
Three minutes
until evacuation is complete, sir.

14
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:46,665
Chinese airspace has been locked
and sealed, one-mile radius.

15
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,750
All right, give NEST team the go.

16
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,627
Black Hawks, you're clear to land.

17
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,965
Ding-a-ling!
Come out and get your ice cream.

18
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:01,555
Any bad robot out there
better get ready for an ass-whupping.

19
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:10,855
For the last two years,
an advance team of new Autobots

20
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:14,233
has taken refuge here
under my command.

21
00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:16,151
Arcees, get ready to launch.

22
00:03:16,236 --> 00:03:17,736
We're locked and loaded.

23
00:03:17,821 --> 00:03:21,866
Together, we form an alliance
with the humans,

24
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,160
a secret but brave squad of soldiers.

25
00:03:25,245 --> 00:03:28,163
All right, listen up. China's cover story
on this one is "toxic spill."

26
00:03:28,248 --> 00:03:30,499
They had to evac the area
for search and rescue.

27
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:33,043
This makes six enemy contacts
in eight months.

28
00:03:33,128 --> 00:03:36,338
We gotta make sure this one does not
get out in the public eye, so keep it tight.

29
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:40,634
A classified strike team called NEST.

30
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,346
We hunt for what remains
of our Decepticon foes

31
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:47,433
hiding in different countries
around the globe.

32
00:03:47,517 --> 00:03:48,851
Roll in Alpha through Echo now.

33
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,112
Move out! Let's go!

34
00:04:17,631 --> 00:04:21,717
All right, Ironhide.
We got echoes. They're close.

35
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:24,720
Steel stacks at 2 o'clock.

36
00:04:36,023 --> 00:04:39,484
He's here. I smell him.

37
00:04:43,864 --> 00:04:45,990
It's close. It's getting closer.

38
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:53,164
- Oh, no.
- What have you got?

39
00:04:53,874 --> 00:04:55,500
Thermal ripple.

40
00:04:57,586 --> 00:05:00,505
Right, everybody, be steady.
We're right on top of it.

41
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:14,394
Eagle niner!

42
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:16,187
I need an energy proton.

43
00:05:30,285 --> 00:05:32,870
Panther 1, requesting fire mission now!

44
00:05:33,497 --> 00:05:35,373
Gunships on station. Roll in hot!

45
00:05:35,457 --> 00:05:37,250
Dog 1, now we are engaging.

46
00:05:46,593 --> 00:05:47,802
We got a second Decepticon.

47
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,683
Arcee twins! Target coming your way!

48
00:05:58,396 --> 00:06:00,147
I got him, I got him!

49
00:06:30,178 --> 00:06:33,221
I screwed that up. I'm okay. I'm all right.

50
00:06:33,306 --> 00:06:35,474
- This is combat, man.
- Total brain freeze, man.

51
00:06:35,558 --> 00:06:36,641
What's wrong with you?

52
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:42,105
Bring in Sideswipe!

53
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,484
Clear a path!

54
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:02,667
Damn, I'm good!

55
00:07:12,095 --> 00:07:15,430
Air support, we need Big Buddha
to deliver the drop now!

56
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:17,933
Cyclone 98, final attack hitting in 120.

57
00:07:18,017 --> 00:07:22,269
Clear to drop in
five, four, three, two, one.

58
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:38,619
Autobots, I'm in pursuit!

59
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,774
Pull over!

60
00:08:29,504 --> 00:08:31,839
Punk-ass Decepticon!

61
00:08:31,923 --> 00:08:34,258
Any last words?

62
00:08:34,342 --> 00:08:38,053
This is not your planet to rule!

63
00:08:38,138 --> 00:08:40,472
The Fallen shall rise again.

64
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:43,642
That doesn't sound good.

65
00:08:43,852 --> 00:08:45,853
Not today.

66
00:08:51,108 --> 00:08:53,484
Come on, let's go! All hands on deck!

67
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:56,362
Frankie, Mojo, out!
Come on, kiddo, we're on a schedule.

68
00:08:56,447 --> 00:08:58,907
Slow down, Dad. Why are you
in such a hurry to get rid of me?

69
00:08:58,991 --> 00:09:01,618
- Did you rent the room out?
- No, I got other ideas for your room

70
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:03,870
and it rhymes with "home theater."

71
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:12,754
Look what I found.
It's your little baby booties.

72
00:09:13,797 --> 00:09:17,217
- Ma.
- My little baby-bootie boy.

73
00:09:17,301 --> 00:09:19,093
- You can't go.
- You see this, Dad? This is how

74
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:20,553
you're supposed to react
when the fruit of your loins

75
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:22,889
goes out into the cruel world
to fend for himself, okay?

76
00:09:22,973 --> 00:09:25,433
Yeah, my heart bleeds for you, pal.
College, bummer!

77
00:09:25,517 --> 00:09:29,562
You have to come home every holiday,
not just big ones.

78
00:09:29,647 --> 00:09:31,606
You have to come home for Halloween.

79
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,941
Well, I can't
come home for Halloween, Mom.

80
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:34,442
- Well, then we'll come to you.
- You're not coming.

81
00:09:34,526 --> 00:09:35,693
- No, we're not going anywhere.
- We'll dress up.

82
00:09:35,778 --> 00:09:37,070
We'll be in costumes.
You'll never know it's us.

83
00:09:37,154 --> 00:09:38,738
- You can't do that, Mom.
- Would you let the kid breathe,

84
00:09:38,822 --> 00:09:40,615
for crying out loud? Come on. Go pack.

85
00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:42,242
There's no way you're packed
for a month-long trip.

86
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:45,578
Come on, chop, chop!
Let's go. March, young lady.

87
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:48,414
- Dad.
- I love it when you call me "young lady,"

88
00:09:48,499 --> 00:09:50,541
- you dirty old man.
- You ain't seen nothing yet.

89
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:52,669
- Dad, Dad, Dad, whoa!
- What?

90
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:55,129
I'm watching what you're doing, Dad.
It's not a rap video.

91
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:56,547
It's just like a coach thing.

92
00:09:56,632 --> 00:09:58,508
That was
a really creepy move just now, Dad.

93
00:09:58,592 --> 00:10:03,721
Look. You know, your mother and me
are really proud of you.

94
00:10:03,806 --> 00:10:06,266
You're the first Witwicky
ever to go to college.

95
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,978
Now I'm crying again! This sucks!

96
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:11,854
You're gonna be okay, Ma.

97
00:10:11,939 --> 00:10:13,397
You know, it's just going to be,

98
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:19,278
you know, hard for her to accept
that her boy's all grown up, you know,

99
00:10:19,362 --> 00:10:22,281
going out to handle the world
on his own.

100
00:10:22,365 --> 00:10:24,616
- You okay, Pop?
- Yeah.

101
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:27,286
Mojo, no dominating Frankie!

102
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,664
Get the hell off the couch,
you filthy beasts!

103
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:32,791
You'll see a lot of that in college, too.

104
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:36,044
- What are you talking about, Dad?
- There's gonna be a lot of women there.

105
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:37,796
Yeah, well,
I'm a one-woman kind of guy.

106
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,214
Look, Mikaela's the greatest,

107
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:41,925
but you gotta give each other
room to grow, okay?

108
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,261
You're no different
than any other couple your age.

109
00:10:44,345 --> 00:10:46,513
Except we discovered
an alien race together.

110
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:48,015
How long you gonna be riding
that scooter?

111
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:02,029
Dad, listen, I know what the odds are.
We're the exception, okay?

112
00:11:02,113 --> 00:11:04,990
Wait a second. Who could that be?

113
00:11:05,074 --> 00:11:06,867
In two weeks, it could be Muffy.

114
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:08,201
Hey, beautiful.

115
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:10,537
- I'm breaking up with you, Sam.
- Really?

116
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:12,080
You sure?
I'm not hearing a lot of conviction.

117
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:15,751
Well, I am, okay? So, there's no reason
for me to come say good-bye to you.

118
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,086
Wow, you almost sounded serious
that time.

119
00:11:18,755 --> 00:11:22,007
Guess what? I made you
a long-distance relationship kit.

120
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:24,509
Yeah, I got you a webcam,
so we can chat 24/7.

121
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:25,761
All Witwicky, all the time.

122
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:27,846
And I got you a couple souvenirs
from the event

123
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,181
that cannot be mentioned
on cell phones.

124
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:32,768
- Some mixes and candles and stuff.
- Sounds cute. I can't wait.

125
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:35,187
Hey! You want
the infamous D-Day shirt?

126
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:37,439
You kept your nasty, shredded clothes?

127
00:11:37,647 --> 00:11:39,023
Yeah. Of course, I kept it, Mikaela.

128
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:41,150
It's like my Super Bowl jersey.
I bled in this thing.

129
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:43,861
- Wow. You're pretty confident, huh?
- No, it's not that.

130
00:11:43,945 --> 00:11:46,364
It's just that my low self-esteem's
at an all-time high.

131
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,700
You think your little box of souvenirs
is gonna keep me from leaving you?

132
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:51,327
You really should come with me.

133
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,162
They got cheap apartments
near campus.

134
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:56,791
Well, that's not gonna happen
until I get my man-child father,

135
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:59,543
fresh out of prison, back on his feet.

136
00:11:59,628 --> 00:12:01,921
I heard that.
Where'd you put the clutch covers?

137
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:04,382
- Next to the camshafts.
- I love it when you say "camshafts."

138
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:05,508
Whisper it to me.

139
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:09,845
Camshafts.

140
00:12:10,472 --> 00:12:12,014
Why can't I hate you?

141
00:12:12,974 --> 00:12:14,934
It's my Witwicky charm.

142
00:12:15,477 --> 00:12:16,727
Wait, hold on. Wait, hold on a second.

143
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:19,730
I guess we're not breaking up.
I'll be over in 20.

144
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:23,484
Mikaela, I think a sliver of the Cube
got stuck on my shirt.

145
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:30,032
Sam?

146
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,166
There's a fire!

147
00:12:39,584 --> 00:12:41,419
Dad, we got a fire!

148
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:01,480
Fire!

149
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:14,159
Ron, did you know
it was gonna be this hard?

150
00:13:14,243 --> 00:13:15,785
Can you just stop?

151
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,580
Yeah, okay, I'll stop. You carry this shit!

152
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:30,216
- Wow.
- Do you know what?

153
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:31,551
- What?
- I don't want to go anywhere with you.

154
00:13:31,635 --> 00:13:32,802
I don't wanna go to France with you.

155
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:34,429
I don't wanna go
around the corner with you.

156
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:35,805
- I'm going back inside.
- All right, fine.

157
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,931
I'll call you from Paris.

158
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,820
What is all the racket?

159
00:13:50,905 --> 00:13:51,905
Sam?

160
00:13:52,573 --> 00:13:54,365
Dad!

161
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:01,831
- What was that?
- That's the whole kitchen!

162
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:07,420
- Bumblebee... Oh, my...
- Bumblebee!

163
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,858
- 911.
- Bumblebee!

164
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,861
- Get in the garage. Go!
- What the freak just happened?

165
00:14:32,946 --> 00:14:37,199
I'm about to have a nervous breakdown.
Just go in the garage quietly, please.

166
00:14:37,283 --> 00:14:38,784
Holy Mother!

167
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:44,790
- Oh, my God!
- Whatever.

168
00:14:44,874 --> 00:14:47,042
Get in the garage now!

169
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,217
- Firemen! Fire fighters, over here!
- Dogs out! Get the dogs out!

170
00:14:55,301 --> 00:14:59,012
This is it! Come on, you guys.
What are you waiting for?

171
00:15:04,686 --> 00:15:06,687
My house is on fire!

172
00:15:10,149 --> 00:15:12,192
...very important.
- What happened?

173
00:15:12,277 --> 00:15:16,989
Come here. Listen, I need you to take
the Cube sliver and put it in your purse.

174
00:15:17,073 --> 00:15:18,240
- What's going on?
- Just take it.

175
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:20,242
- Sam Witwicky? A word with you.
- Yes, Mom. Yeah.

176
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:22,494
- Hi, Mikaela. I have a bald spot.
- Hi.

177
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:24,955
- An old furnace, I think.
- From a waffle iron.

178
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,584
When you go, he goes. I cannot live
with a psychotic alien in my garage!

179
00:15:28,668 --> 00:15:31,336
Judy... National security.

180
00:15:31,421 --> 00:15:34,965
Look, if we stay quiet,
they're gonna take care of everything.

181
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:38,385
Just consider this
the official start of our remodel, okay?

182
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:41,513
Fine. If the government's paying,
I want a pool and a hot tub!

183
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:44,057
And I'm gonna skinny-dip
and you can't say shit about it!

184
00:15:47,854 --> 00:15:51,273
- Yeah, you know you're in trouble.
- He still having voice problems?

185
00:15:51,357 --> 00:15:53,774
He's playing it up.

186
00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:56,944
Bee, I want to talk to you
about the college thing, okay?

187
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:00,281
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it

188
00:16:00,365 --> 00:16:02,491
Hey, I'm not taking you with me.

189
00:16:03,952 --> 00:16:06,329
I'm gonna wait outside, okay?

190
00:16:07,998 --> 00:16:09,165
I meant to tell you about this earlier.

191
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:11,709
It's just that, you know...
Here's the thing.

192
00:16:11,793 --> 00:16:14,003
Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars.

193
00:16:14,087 --> 00:16:17,089
I know, and if it was up to me,
I'd take you with me, but it's not, Bee.

194
00:16:17,174 --> 00:16:19,967
Look. You're an Autobot. You shouldn't
be living in my dad's garage.

195
00:16:20,052 --> 00:16:24,430
I mean, you're suffocating in here.
You deserve better than this.

196
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:25,973
This is hard enough, man.
Don't make it harder.

197
00:16:26,058 --> 00:16:28,434
Can you just look at me, please?

198
00:16:29,728 --> 00:16:32,897
Come on, big guy.
Look, the guardian thing is done.

199
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:36,317
Okay? You did your job.
Look, I'm safe now.

200
00:16:36,401 --> 00:16:38,861
You need to go be with
Optimus Prime and the others.

201
00:16:38,945 --> 00:16:42,323
I just want to be normal, Bee.
That's why I'm going to college,

202
00:16:42,407 --> 00:16:44,575
and I can't do that with you.

203
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:47,495
It's not the last time I'm gonna see you,
you know, Bee.

204
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:51,374
Come on, don't do that. Bee.
You're killing me, Bee.

205
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,586
But you'll always be my first car.

206
00:16:57,464 --> 00:16:59,131
Love you, Bee.

207
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:05,971
Wow!

208
00:17:06,181 --> 00:17:09,225
Between State Farm and the taxpayers,
we're all taken care of.

209
00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:10,810
- You got dirt all over you.
- Stop. Stop.

210
00:17:10,894 --> 00:17:12,395
- What?
- Stop, I'm okay.

211
00:17:12,479 --> 00:17:13,854
Look.

212
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:17,191
So, you think you can make it through
those East Coast winters without me?

213
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:19,526
You're the best thing
to ever happen to me.

214
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:22,612
- And?
- And I'll do anything for you.

215
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:24,531
And?

216
00:17:24,615 --> 00:17:27,701
- I think Sam's about to say the L-word.
- Let's go, kiddo!

217
00:17:27,785 --> 00:17:28,868
Nice timing, Dad.

218
00:17:29,286 --> 00:17:30,954
I adore you.

219
00:17:32,373 --> 00:17:33,373
That's not the word that I want

220
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:34,874
- to hear right now.
- What are you talking about?

221
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:35,959
It's the same word as the other word.

222
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:37,877
- It's not the same word.
- Look, if I say the other word now

223
00:17:37,962 --> 00:17:39,504
and you forced me to say it,
it won't mean anything, plus

224
00:17:39,588 --> 00:17:41,840
you haven't said it either.
So, don't get mad at me for not saying it.

225
00:17:41,924 --> 00:17:44,509
Yeah, but I haven't said it because guys
always run when you say it first.

226
00:17:44,593 --> 00:17:48,221
Yeah, well, so do girls.
Especially girls like you, with options.

227
00:17:48,305 --> 00:17:52,475
So, this is all part of your elaborate plan
to keep me interested?

228
00:17:53,269 --> 00:17:56,146
- It can be.
- I hate that it's working.

229
00:17:57,273 --> 00:17:58,982
Can I have a kiss?

230
00:17:59,608 --> 00:18:01,818
We're going to make it work, I promise.

231
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:38,938
Soundwave acknowledges. Pursue her.

232
00:18:39,023 --> 00:18:41,024
Retrieve it.

233
00:19:02,754 --> 00:19:05,589
Autobot twins, report to Hangar Three.

234
00:19:06,758 --> 00:19:08,509
Bad-ass ice-cream truck
coming through.

235
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:10,469
- Excuse me! Excuse me! Hello!
- No, I don't...

236
00:19:10,553 --> 00:19:11,678
- Hold up.
- Those are nice.

237
00:19:11,763 --> 00:19:13,388
Yeah, baby, it's upgrade time.

238
00:19:13,473 --> 00:19:17,142
Yes, sir. Yeah!
Look here, it's my booty call right here!

239
00:19:17,227 --> 00:19:21,104
- Time to get my sexy on with the green.
- Green? No, green is mine!

240
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:22,564
I call green!

241
00:19:25,568 --> 00:19:27,027
- I got the green.
- That hurt, man.

242
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:29,279
It's supposed to hurt. It's an ass-kicking.

243
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,750
Present arms!

244
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:58,517
Director Galloway, what an honor.
I'd love to show you around,

245
00:19:58,601 --> 00:20:00,102
but you gotta be
on the classified access list.

246
00:20:00,186 --> 00:20:02,771
I am now. Presidential order, Major.

247
00:20:02,856 --> 00:20:05,774
I got a message
for your classified space buddies!

248
00:20:05,859 --> 00:20:07,943
You guys made a mess of Shanghai.

249
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,323
All right, so this is where
we communicate with the JCS

250
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:17,577
and this area serves
as the Autobots' hangar.

251
00:20:19,454 --> 00:20:21,956
Secure link to JCS is up, Major.

252
00:20:45,814 --> 00:20:47,648
Secure line to
the Pentagon is now open.

253
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:50,735
- General?
- Will, I saw the Shanghai op.

254
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:53,321
- We had a rough day out there.
- Yes, sir.

255
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:56,282
We have intel that I believe
warrants an immediate debrief.

256
00:20:56,366 --> 00:20:58,576
Now with your permission,
I can't let you see him,

257
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,037
but I would like you to hear
from the leader of the Autobots.

258
00:21:01,121 --> 00:21:02,163
Proceed.

259
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:22,433
You gotta wonder,

260
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:25,853
if God made us in his image,
who made him?

261
00:21:27,022 --> 00:21:29,231
General, our alliance
has countermanded

262
00:21:29,316 --> 00:21:31,943
six Decepticon incursions this year,

263
00:21:32,027 --> 00:21:34,612
each on a different continent.

264
00:21:34,696 --> 00:21:37,614
They're clearly searching
around the world for something,

265
00:21:37,698 --> 00:21:41,076
but last night's encounter
came with a warning.

266
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,828
"The Fallen shall rise again."

267
00:21:43,913 --> 00:21:46,206
"The Fallen." Meaning what?

268
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,709
Origin unknown.
The only recorded history of our race

269
00:21:49,794 --> 00:21:53,964
was contained within the AllSpark
and lost with its destruction.

270
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,632
Excuse me!

271
00:21:56,425 --> 00:22:00,971
With this so-called AllSpark
now destroyed,

272
00:22:01,055 --> 00:22:04,599
why hasn't the enemy left the planet
like you thought they would?

273
00:22:04,684 --> 00:22:06,977
Director Galloway,
our National Security Advisor.

274
00:22:07,061 --> 00:22:10,021
The President just appointed him liaison.

275
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:12,691
Well, I guess I didn't get that memo.

276
00:22:14,193 --> 00:22:17,779
Forgive the interruption, General.
Excuse me. Coming through.

277
00:22:18,406 --> 00:22:20,240
Excuse me. Excuse me, soldier.

278
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:23,535
After all the damage in Shanghai,

279
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:27,580
the President is hard-pressed
to say the job's getting done.

280
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:33,878
Now, under the classified Alien/Autobot
Cooperation Act,

281
00:22:33,963 --> 00:22:39,509
you agreed to share your intel with us,
but not your advancements in weaponry.

282
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:43,513
We've witnessed
your human capacity for war.

283
00:22:43,597 --> 00:22:47,183
It would absolutely bring
more harm than good.

284
00:22:47,268 --> 00:22:50,145
But who are you to judge
what's best for us?

285
00:22:50,229 --> 00:22:52,272
With all due respect,
we've been fighting side by side

286
00:22:52,356 --> 00:22:53,898
in the field for two years.

287
00:22:53,983 --> 00:22:57,277
We've shed blood,
sweat and precious metal together.

288
00:22:57,361 --> 00:23:00,071
Soldier, you're paid to shoot, not talk.

289
00:23:00,156 --> 00:23:01,780
Don't tempt me.

290
00:23:01,865 --> 00:23:04,366
And the newest members of your team.

291
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:06,744
- Easy.
- I understand they arrived here

292
00:23:06,828 --> 00:23:08,704
after you sent a message into space,

293
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:12,541
an open invitation to come to Earth,
vetted by no one at the White House.

294
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:16,378
Let me stop you right there,
Mr. Galloway. It was vetted right here.

295
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:20,382
And in my experience, the judgment
of both Major Lennox and his team

296
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:23,385
has always been above reproach.

297
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,305
Well, be that as it may, General,
it is the position of the President

298
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:31,935
that when our national security is
at stake, no one is above reproach.

299
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:35,147
Now, what do we know so far?

300
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:41,653
We know that the enemy leader,
classified NBE One, aka Megatron,

301
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:45,324
is rusting in peace at the bottom
of the Laurentian Abyssal,

302
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:49,912
surrounded by SOSUS detection nets
and a full-time submarine surveillance.

303
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:54,416
We also know that the only remaining
piece of your alien AllSpark

304
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:56,418
is locked in an electromagnetic vault

305
00:23:56,503 --> 00:23:59,838
here on one of the most secure
naval bases in the world.

306
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:04,426
Decepticons, we have located the shard.

307
00:24:04,511 --> 00:24:10,349
And since no one can seem to tell me
what the enemy is now after,

308
00:24:10,433 --> 00:24:13,268
well, there's only one clear conclusion!

309
00:24:13,353 --> 00:24:16,188
You! The Autobots!

310
00:24:17,023 --> 00:24:19,316
They're here to hunt you!

311
00:24:19,943 --> 00:24:22,361
What's there to hunt for on Earth
besides that?

312
00:24:22,445 --> 00:24:25,322
"The Fallen shall rise again"?

313
00:24:25,406 --> 00:24:27,615
It sounds to me
like something's coming.

314
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:32,453
So, let me ask, if we ultimately conclude
that our national security is best served

315
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:36,249
by denying you further asylum
on our planet,

316
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:41,254
will you leave peacefully?

317
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:46,217
Freedom is your right. If you make
that request, we will honor it.

318
00:24:47,427 --> 00:24:52,557
But before your President decides,
please ask him this.

319
00:24:53,016 --> 00:24:57,520
What if we leave and you're wrong?

320
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,071
That's a good question.

321
00:25:09,992 --> 00:25:13,703
Oh, my gosh! Look at this place!

322
00:25:14,538 --> 00:25:16,831
I feel smarter already.

323
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:21,794
- Ron, can you smell it?
- Yeah, smells like $40,000 a year.

324
00:25:21,879 --> 00:25:26,382
- Hey, cheapo!
- Hey, go ahead. We'll get your stuff.

325
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:27,508
Just go ahead and check out your room.

326
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:28,593
Yeah, go.

327
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:38,186
- Hey.
- Hey.

328
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:41,189
- You must be Sam, right? I'm Leo.
- Hey.

329
00:25:42,232 --> 00:25:45,776
So, I already set up the crib a bit.
You want this side or that side?

330
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:49,363
- That side.
- I already chose that side.

331
00:25:50,991 --> 00:25:53,742
You know what this is?
This is the awkward moment.

332
00:25:53,826 --> 00:25:55,410
Yeah, see,
you're trying to see if I'm a normal guy.

333
00:25:55,494 --> 00:25:56,786
I'm trying to see if you're a normal guy.

334
00:25:56,871 --> 00:25:58,413
Balanced, unmedicated,
nothing under the crawl space.

335
00:25:58,497 --> 00:25:59,873
Good personal hygiene,
won't stab me in my sleep.

336
00:25:59,957 --> 00:26:00,999
No criminal record, won't steal anything.

337
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:02,626
- Including girlfriends.
- Especially girlfriends.

338
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,961
- You got a girlfriend?
- I do. You?

339
00:26:05,796 --> 00:26:08,423
No, not a chance. You a techie?

340
00:26:08,507 --> 00:26:10,717
Sweet! Sharsky,
Fassbinder, where we at?

341
00:26:10,801 --> 00:26:13,053
- Server's almost online, Leo.
- Network's up and running.

342
00:26:13,137 --> 00:26:14,554
Beautiful, that's what I like to hear.

343
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,641
That's Sharsky, that's Fassbinder,
my IT gurus.

344
00:26:17,725 --> 00:26:20,852
Welcome to my empire, bro,
TheRealEffingDeal. Com.

345
00:26:20,937 --> 00:26:22,187
That's me, I'm sure you've heard of it.

346
00:26:22,271 --> 00:26:24,689
- No, I haven't.
- Well, that sucks.

347
00:26:24,774 --> 00:26:26,233
- What is all this for?
- See where I'm going, bro.

348
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:29,236
Look, call me gross,
I want to be a baby billionaire.

349
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,821
Kitten calendars.
That's where I started. Look at me now.

350
00:26:31,906 --> 00:26:33,156
Got to have dreams, bro.

351
00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:37,911
Leo! We got
some brand-new Shanghai vid!

352
00:26:37,995 --> 00:26:40,956
Post it, baby! Go, go, go! FTJ! FTJ!

353
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,416
- What's "FTJ"?
- "Fuel the Jet."

354
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:44,834
Fuel the Jet, bro.

355
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:47,295
FTJ. FTJ, legit!

356
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:49,756
Did you see that? Did you see that?

357
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,300
Look at this. Half of Shanghai gets
wrecked and China says "gas leak."

358
00:26:52,385 --> 00:26:54,761
Don't believe the hype, bro.

359
00:26:54,845 --> 00:26:58,473
Just like the alien robots in LA
two years ago that everyone covered up.

360
00:26:58,557 --> 00:27:00,934
Yeah, I saw these robots,
and they did this, like, firing thing

361
00:27:01,018 --> 00:27:03,270
and they came down and toasted
this woman, and she was like...

362
00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:05,313
- It looks fake to me.
- Dude, it's not fake.

363
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:08,483
The Internet is pure truth.
Video doesn't lie.

364
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:10,193
- It looks fake.
- No, man, I've seen them.

365
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:13,488
- They're, like, these robots...
- Look, look, it's fake.

366
00:27:13,572 --> 00:27:15,073
Anybody could do it
on any computer, okay?

367
00:27:15,157 --> 00:27:17,199
And I wasn't there,

368
00:27:17,284 --> 00:27:19,493
- so I can't comment or speculate.
- No.

369
00:27:19,577 --> 00:27:21,787
"Comment or speculate"?
And we're supposed to cohabitate?

370
00:27:21,871 --> 00:27:24,832
No, listen, okay?
Don't be sucking the sack, bro!

371
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:26,625
- Which sack?
- The ball sack.

372
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,252
Dude, what kind of tool are you?

373
00:27:28,336 --> 00:27:31,338
Mainstream media sack.
They're lying to us, all right?

374
00:27:31,423 --> 00:27:33,799
- It's aliens, man.
- Okay, okay.

375
00:27:33,883 --> 00:27:35,134
Follow me.

376
00:27:36,011 --> 00:27:37,219
Leo, bad news!

377
00:27:37,304 --> 00:27:39,638
We just got scooped.
The video's already up on GFR.

378
00:27:39,723 --> 00:27:41,223
Fassbinder!

379
00:27:42,392 --> 00:27:44,643
Robo-Warrior, the guy's our main
competition on conspiracy stuff.

380
00:27:44,728 --> 00:27:46,770
"Effing" was my F-ing idea
and he stole it!

381
00:27:46,855 --> 00:27:49,356
He's been linking to my site
and thieving hits forever.

382
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:51,817
By the way, I read your file.
I'm poor, you're poor.

383
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:55,070
We're gonna fix that, all right?
You work for me now.

384
00:27:56,406 --> 00:27:58,490
I work for you now? That's incredible.

385
00:27:58,575 --> 00:28:01,493
It's first day of college,
I got a career in a dinky Internet firm

386
00:28:01,578 --> 00:28:04,621
with a boss who is made up
of just pure champion stuff.

387
00:28:04,706 --> 00:28:06,665
Are you mocking
my life's work, Samuel?

388
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:08,292
That's your one warning patrolling,
dude. Don't make me

389
00:28:08,376 --> 00:28:10,002
have Fassbinder hack your financial aid,
'cause I'll do it!

390
00:28:10,086 --> 00:28:13,339
Hey, RA. Listen, it's getting a little
intense in my room. Can I switch out?

391
00:28:13,423 --> 00:28:18,302
Sad face, 312. No switching, no trading.
Let's turn that frown upside down, okay?

392
00:28:18,386 --> 00:28:19,470
- Oh, here we go.
- We made it. Hi.

393
00:28:19,554 --> 00:28:20,679
It's just like Hogwarts.

394
00:28:20,764 --> 00:28:21,972
- Hi.
- Is this co-ed?

395
00:28:22,057 --> 00:28:23,349
This is a co-ed dorm.

396
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:24,892
- You guys want to meet my roommates?
- Yeah.

397
00:28:24,976 --> 00:28:26,226
Some real swell guys.

398
00:28:26,311 --> 00:28:27,686
- Here's Leo.
- We're the Witwickys.

399
00:28:27,771 --> 00:28:28,854
- I'm Leo.
- I'm Judy.

400
00:28:28,938 --> 00:28:30,731
Hey, you have a great son, you really do.

401
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:33,359
- Well, aren't you the sweetest thing?
- Yeah, he's real sweet, Ma.

402
00:28:33,443 --> 00:28:34,610
What is that in your hand, by the way?

403
00:28:34,694 --> 00:28:38,781
I got this at the bake sale for the
environment that those boys are having.

404
00:28:38,865 --> 00:28:41,784
You know, you don't often see
white boys with the dreadlocks.

405
00:28:41,868 --> 00:28:43,409
- Mom?
- Yeah, it's 100% pure,

406
00:28:43,494 --> 00:28:45,119
Hawaiian green for the environment.

407
00:28:45,204 --> 00:28:46,704
- How many of these have you eaten?
- Drop it.

408
00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:48,706
- What is this?
- Yeah, they baked it with reefer in it.

409
00:28:48,791 --> 00:28:50,166
- No, it's...
- Please, give me...

410
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,377
Hey! It's my cheat day.
I can eat what I want.

411
00:28:52,461 --> 00:28:54,379
I'm going to freak out.
Please do something right now, Dad.

412
00:28:54,463 --> 00:28:55,671
Please do something right now.

413
00:28:56,632 --> 00:28:58,299
I can eat all the fricking brownies I want!

414
00:28:58,384 --> 00:28:59,425
Come on, let's go.

415
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,010
I'm sorry and you're welcome.

416
00:29:04,264 --> 00:29:05,932
We call it the "Hot Freshman 55."

417
00:29:06,016 --> 00:29:08,976
Sharsky hacked Campus Housing and
stacked the dorm with pretty Betties.

418
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:11,479
Is... Is so nice...

419
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:15,942
Oh, my God. That's her. She's coming.
She sees me, she sees me.

420
00:29:18,153 --> 00:29:19,612
She's tied for number one
on my to-do list.

421
00:29:19,696 --> 00:29:21,406
Do not bird-dog my quail, you hear me?

422
00:29:21,865 --> 00:29:25,743
Pretty girls! Hey, you.
My son lives in this dorm.

423
00:29:26,453 --> 00:29:28,996
You should go make friends with him.
He's Sam.

424
00:29:29,081 --> 00:29:30,415
Glad she ain't my mama!

425
00:29:30,499 --> 00:29:32,708
And he recently had his cherry popped!

426
00:29:34,211 --> 00:29:36,087
He didn't know I was in the house!
I heard it all!

427
00:29:36,171 --> 00:29:37,839
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Here he is!

428
00:29:38,424 --> 00:29:41,467
He would get in my closet
and dress up as Boy Spice!

429
00:29:41,552 --> 00:29:47,432
- Hey, and his car is a talking robot!
- No, like the GPS. OnStar!

430
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:49,350
- OnStar.
- Frisbee!

431
00:29:50,436 --> 00:29:53,479
No, Dad! Dad, you just gonna
let her run around the school?

432
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,279
- Give it! Mine, mine, mine!
- Hey! Crazy!

433
00:30:01,363 --> 00:30:03,531
- You want it?
- I want it.

434
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:07,034
Judy, Judy, just... Just put it down.

435
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,494
- You gotta control your mother.
- I don't know who this woman is.

436
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:12,122
Hey, Professor, I'd do anything for an A.

437
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:15,083
All right, Grace Slick. We got
some snacks in the car. Let's go.

438
00:30:15,168 --> 00:30:18,044
- Did you get the booties? All right.
- Yes, Dad, I got the booties!

439
00:30:18,546 --> 00:30:19,921
I'm upside down!

440
00:30:51,787 --> 00:30:53,497
Black Lion X-Ray,
this is Black Lion Tango.

441
00:30:53,581 --> 00:30:57,417
We have activation of motion sensors
on the western perimeter fence.

442
00:32:13,118 --> 00:32:15,411
Breach at B-14.

443
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,667
Go, go, go, go!

444
00:32:29,926 --> 00:32:31,677
The shard's gone.

445
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:41,645
Contact!

446
00:32:42,522 --> 00:32:44,023
Take it down!

447
00:32:44,816 --> 00:32:46,275
- Which way?
- Shoot left!

448
00:32:51,865 --> 00:32:53,449
Knock it down!

449
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:05,293
First frat party's the game changer.
Boys, we're hunting in the wild now.

450
00:33:05,377 --> 00:33:07,045
So, get your game faces on.

451
00:33:07,129 --> 00:33:09,255
I can't stay long.
I have a webcam date with my girlfriend.

452
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,548
- That's so cool!
- No, it's not.

453
00:33:16,889 --> 00:33:18,556
While he's making out
with his MacBook,

454
00:33:18,641 --> 00:33:20,516
I'm gonna be getting
my Spitzy freaky freak on.

455
00:33:20,601 --> 00:33:22,810
- Let's roll.
- She's hot.

456
00:33:22,895 --> 00:33:24,729
Bro, we're hunting!

457
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,109
- See you, darling.
- Bye, Dad.

458
00:33:30,903 --> 00:33:32,278
Okay.

459
00:33:37,117 --> 00:33:40,578
This is our first live chat date.
I've never done it before.

460
00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:42,955
I'm kind of nervous.

461
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:11,776
- Are you okay?
- No.

462
00:34:12,903 --> 00:34:15,530
I was getting a napkin for my drink.

463
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:18,950
Thanks. Cheers.

464
00:34:19,034 --> 00:34:21,035
- It's Sam, right?
- Yeah.

465
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,788
- I wanna dance.
- What, like... Like dancing?

466
00:34:25,623 --> 00:34:27,958
Like a pairing? Like a duo?
Like a coupling?

467
00:34:28,042 --> 00:34:32,838
'Cause I'm in a permanently semi...
I'm in a relationship, kind of...

468
00:34:33,423 --> 00:34:37,259
- Relax. I just want to have some fun.
- Wanna have some fun?

469
00:34:37,343 --> 00:34:41,346
Yeah, okay. Let's play some checkers.
You can sit over there and...

470
00:34:43,266 --> 00:34:44,307
Oh, my...

471
00:34:44,392 --> 00:34:48,019
So, how about tonight
you pretend I'm your girlfriend

472
00:34:48,104 --> 00:34:50,230
and I pretend that you're my boyfriend?

473
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:03,493
Hey! Who drove
the freaking yellow Camaro?

474
00:35:04,746 --> 00:35:06,913
There is a car on the lawn!

475
00:35:10,793 --> 00:35:11,918
What are you doing?

476
00:35:12,003 --> 00:35:13,503
Houston, we have a problem.

477
00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:14,671
- What is it?
- Freshman!

478
00:35:14,756 --> 00:35:16,256
- Yeah?
- Is that your car in our bushes?

479
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,218
No, there's a friend of mine,
he just went to get you a tighter shirt.

480
00:35:20,303 --> 00:35:23,013
There isn't a tighter shirt! We checked.

481
00:35:23,097 --> 00:35:24,723
Now how about
I park my foot in your ass?

482
00:35:24,807 --> 00:35:26,433
- What size shoe do you wear?
- Yeah?

483
00:35:26,517 --> 00:35:28,518
- Hold on.
- You wanna try?

484
00:35:28,603 --> 00:35:31,438
- I'll back it up right now.
- Get him out of here.

485
00:35:31,522 --> 00:35:34,274
You have a ride?
Bro, why are you holding out on us?

486
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:35,442
I've only known you 17 hours.

487
00:35:35,526 --> 00:35:39,029
This is gonna really change our lives.
You have no idea.

488
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:43,325
- I love Camaros.
- I can't do this right now, okay?

489
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:45,327
- Don't be a wimp.
- Oh, God!

490
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,963
- My first car was my dad's '92 Z28.
- Yeah?

491
00:35:58,048 --> 00:36:02,802
Fuel-injected.
The roar of the engine, it just tickles me.

492
00:36:03,804 --> 00:36:06,180
We shouldn't stare...

493
00:36:06,264 --> 00:36:09,767
I mean, share stories
with each other at all.

494
00:36:09,851 --> 00:36:12,144
Come on, Sam. Just one ride.

495
00:36:12,229 --> 00:36:14,730
Your cheatin' heart

496
00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:19,985
Don't. Don't!

497
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,822
She's a super freak, super freak
She's super freaky

498
00:36:22,906 --> 00:36:26,033
- Is your radio broken?
- No, my concentration is.

499
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:27,910
We're not cheating.

500
00:36:28,995 --> 00:36:30,538
Not yet.

501
00:36:33,875 --> 00:36:35,876
Is something wrong here?

502
00:36:40,257 --> 00:36:42,049
God! You okay?

503
00:36:44,594 --> 00:36:46,011
She's mighty, mighty

504
00:36:46,096 --> 00:36:49,390
I really don't know what to tell you.
This car has a lot of problems. A lot...

505
00:36:55,522 --> 00:36:57,606
Oh, God! It's in my mouth!

506
00:36:58,066 --> 00:37:00,025
Are you okay? I got Wetnaps.

507
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,486
I got Wetnaps for your face! Hold on!

508
00:37:02,571 --> 00:37:04,655
I... I'm so sorry!

509
00:37:06,449 --> 00:37:07,491
What are you doing?

510
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:22,505
You won't give me a day, huh?

511
00:37:23,132 --> 00:37:26,384
- You won't give me one day in college?
- I'm sorry, Sam,

512
00:37:26,468 --> 00:37:29,804
but the last fragment of the AllSpark
was stolen.

513
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:31,723
Like what? Like Decepticons stole it?

514
00:37:31,807 --> 00:37:35,852
We placed it under human protection
at your government's request,

515
00:37:35,936 --> 00:37:38,730
but I'm here for your help, Sam,

516
00:37:38,814 --> 00:37:43,234
because your leaders believe we
brought vengeance upon your planet.

517
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:45,320
Perhaps they are right.

518
00:37:45,404 --> 00:37:50,491
That is why they must be reminded by
another human of the trust we share.

519
00:37:50,576 --> 00:37:53,286
- This isn't my war.
- Not yet,

520
00:37:54,163 --> 00:37:56,748
but I fear it soon will be.

521
00:37:56,832 --> 00:38:00,376
Your world must not share
the same fate as Cybertron.

522
00:38:01,629 --> 00:38:03,630
Whole generations lost.

523
00:38:07,468 --> 00:38:10,511
I know, and I want to help you, I do,

524
00:38:10,596 --> 00:38:13,681
but I am not some alien ambassador,
you know?

525
00:38:13,766 --> 00:38:15,558
I'm a normal kid with normal problems.

526
00:38:16,602 --> 00:38:19,020
I am where I'm supposed to be.

527
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,358
I'm sorry. I...

528
00:38:25,027 --> 00:38:26,110
I really am.

529
00:38:26,195 --> 00:38:30,031
Sam, fate rarely calls upon us
at a moment of our choosing.

530
00:38:30,824 --> 00:38:33,660
You're Optimus Prime.
You don't need me.

531
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,914
We do, more than you know.

532
00:39:11,155 --> 00:39:15,534
Conn, Sonar. Gained new contact,
bearing 214, and possible hostile,

533
00:39:15,618 --> 00:39:17,619
confirmed for
Project Deep Six Drop Point.

534
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:20,414
- What do you got?
- SU pulled five contacts at 5,000 feet,

535
00:39:20,498 --> 00:39:21,707
diving fast.

536
00:39:25,962 --> 00:39:28,005
Never seen anything
dive that deep that fast.

537
00:39:28,089 --> 00:39:31,591
- Man battle stations.
- Chief of the watch, man battle stations!

538
00:39:31,676 --> 00:39:33,552
Helm, left full rudder,
all ahead two-thirds.

539
00:39:33,886 --> 00:39:36,346
- Left full rudder, two-thirds.
- Dive, go deep.

540
00:39:58,536 --> 00:40:00,746
The nets protecting NBE One
are screaming, sir.

541
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:04,708
That is 9,300 fathoms down.
And no confirmed DSRVs on site?

542
00:40:04,792 --> 00:40:06,959
- None, sir.
- Then, people, we've got a problem!

543
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:21,265
Need parts! Kill the little one!

544
00:40:28,732 --> 00:40:30,858
The shard make Energon!

545
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:47,041
Conn, Sonar. Now hold six contacts,
and they're coming up fast!

546
00:40:47,125 --> 00:40:49,502
- Sound collision alarm.
- Left hard rudder.

547
00:40:50,879 --> 00:40:52,338
Five hundred feet.

548
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:55,341
Angel Six,
we got six hostiles coming up.

549
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:05,559
- Collision imminent port side.
- One hundred feet.

550
00:41:05,644 --> 00:41:06,685
Brace for impact.

551
00:41:33,254 --> 00:41:36,256
Starscream, I'm home.

552
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:41,427
Lord Megatron, I was so relieved
to hear of your resurrection.

553
00:41:41,512 --> 00:41:45,682
You left me to die
on that pathetic insect planet.

554
00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:50,645
Only to help spawn our new army.
The Fallen decrees it!

555
00:41:50,729 --> 00:41:55,066
After all, in your absence,
someone had to take command.

556
00:41:56,986 --> 00:42:00,363
- So disappointing.
- Hatchlings! Hatchlings! Careful, fragile!

557
00:42:00,447 --> 00:42:04,576
Even in death,
there is no command but mine.

558
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:13,960
My master, I failed you on Earth.

559
00:42:14,044 --> 00:42:19,674
The AllSpark is destroyed
and without it, our race will perish.

560
00:42:20,551 --> 00:42:26,139
You have much to learn, my disciple.
The Cube was merely a vessel.

561
00:42:26,223 --> 00:42:29,851
Its power, its knowledge,
can never be destroyed.

562
00:42:29,935 --> 00:42:34,522
- It can only transform.
- How is that possible?

563
00:42:34,607 --> 00:42:38,193
It has been absorbed
by the human child.

564
00:42:38,277 --> 00:42:43,323
The key to saving our race
now lies within his mind.

565
00:42:43,407 --> 00:42:47,035
Well, then, let me strip
the very flesh from his body!

566
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,580
And you will, my apprentice, in time.

567
00:42:50,664 --> 00:42:55,960
For millennia, I have dreamed
of my return to that wretched planet

568
00:42:56,045 --> 00:43:02,633
where I, too, was once betrayed
by the Primes I called my brothers.

569
00:43:03,468 --> 00:43:10,307
Only a Prime can defeat me,
and now, only one remains.

570
00:43:10,642 --> 00:43:14,019
Optimus! He protects the boy.

571
00:43:14,103 --> 00:43:17,397
Then the boy will lead us to him

572
00:43:17,482 --> 00:43:22,986
- and revenge will be ours.
- Yes.

573
00:43:23,988 --> 00:43:28,158
The boy will not escape us.
We have him in our sights.

574
00:43:29,327 --> 00:43:33,288
Without more Energon,
the hatchlings will keep dying.

575
00:43:38,753 --> 00:43:43,090
Space. Time. Gravity.

576
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:50,097
- Thank you.
- Finish that for me.

577
00:43:50,181 --> 00:43:53,058
We're going on a journey together,
you and I, today.

578
00:43:53,142 --> 00:43:58,146
All you eager, nubile, young minds
on the very cusp of adulthood.

579
00:43:58,982 --> 00:44:01,984
And I shall be your consort, your guide,

580
00:44:02,068 --> 00:44:06,071
your chaperone,
into the heart of darkness.

581
00:44:08,658 --> 00:44:10,909
Welcome to Astronomy 101.

582
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,539
For what do we know about the stars?

583
00:44:16,082 --> 00:44:19,501
Virgo, the virgin.

584
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:22,503
Orion, the great hunter.

585
00:44:22,587 --> 00:44:27,216
These are no mere twinkling diamonds
for lovely maidens to wish upon.

586
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:29,635
No, they are dynamos

587
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:34,307
filled with a throbbing,
savage and pent-up energy!

588
00:44:34,391 --> 00:44:40,104
Behold the work of Albert Einstein,
a professor once, like moi.

589
00:44:40,188 --> 00:44:41,647
- Energy equals mass...
- What you doing?

590
00:44:41,732 --> 00:44:43,190
Put your hand down.
Put your hand down.

591
00:44:43,275 --> 00:44:45,693
Young man, there are no questions

592
00:44:45,777 --> 00:44:47,737
until I've reached
the climax of my lecture.

593
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:51,157
I just finished your book and there's
only one problem. Einstein's wrong.

594
00:44:51,908 --> 00:44:53,242
Energy does equal
mass times the velocity

595
00:44:53,327 --> 00:44:54,410
of light squared in this dimension,

596
00:44:54,494 --> 00:44:57,455
but what about the other 17?
Nobody ever talks about the other 17.

597
00:44:58,081 --> 00:44:59,749
Clear example.

598
00:45:03,462 --> 00:45:04,795
Break down the elemental components
of Energon,

599
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,340
assume a constant decay rate
and extrapolate for each of the...

600
00:45:07,424 --> 00:45:08,841
Fourteen galactic convergences it took

601
00:45:08,925 --> 00:45:12,553
the Sentinel Prime expedition
to receive an... Echo on its signal,

602
00:45:12,637 --> 00:45:14,597
you wind up with a formula
for inter-dimensional energy increase

603
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:16,098
that mass and light alone
can't possibly explain.

604
00:45:16,183 --> 00:45:18,476
Come on, guys, I can't be
the only one in the class who...

605
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,314
Young man, I will not be
punk'd in front of the dean.

606
00:45:24,691 --> 00:45:28,069
No, this is my universe here.

607
00:45:28,153 --> 00:45:33,532
Do you understand?
I am the alpha and the omega.

608
00:45:33,617 --> 00:45:36,035
- Get out of my class!
- Yes, sir.

609
00:45:39,122 --> 00:45:41,707
Anyone else care to have
some sort of mental breakdown?

610
00:45:51,634 --> 00:45:56,763
Hi, Bones! Hi. Hi.
You're such a good boy.

611
00:45:57,431 --> 00:45:59,641
What a good boy, you are.

612
00:46:04,146 --> 00:46:06,856
Hey, Bones. Are you hungry?

613
00:46:10,444 --> 00:46:12,487
Come on, check that out.

614
00:46:14,448 --> 00:46:16,157
There you go.

615
00:46:23,457 --> 00:46:25,500
- Yes, Samuel?
- Hello? Mikaela?

616
00:46:25,584 --> 00:46:28,169
I can't believe you're gonna stand me up
on our first web chat date.

617
00:46:28,254 --> 00:46:31,047
- Something just happened to me, okay?
- What, you finally hit puberty?

618
00:46:31,132 --> 00:46:32,757
No, no, no. Stop laughing.
This is serious. Okay.

619
00:46:32,842 --> 00:46:34,551
Remember I was telling you
about my great-great-grandfather,

620
00:46:34,635 --> 00:46:36,428
Archibald Witwicky? Remember?

621
00:46:36,512 --> 00:46:39,597
Watch it, watch it, watch... No!
Okay, remember how I was telling you...

622
00:46:39,682 --> 00:46:41,975
Okay. Can you stop?
Watch the foot! Watch your foot!

623
00:46:42,059 --> 00:46:43,101
Mikaela, okay,

624
00:46:43,185 --> 00:46:45,270
my great-great-grandfather
went on this Arctic mission, right?

625
00:46:45,354 --> 00:46:46,938
And he saw Megatron.
Megatron zapped him,

626
00:46:47,022 --> 00:46:48,898
and he started seeing
these crazy symbols. Okay.

627
00:46:48,983 --> 00:46:50,400
Well, now I'm seeing them, too.
Excuse me.

628
00:46:50,484 --> 00:46:52,944
I just read a 903-page astronomy book
in 32.6 seconds.

629
00:46:53,028 --> 00:46:54,404
I had a meltdown
in the middle of my class.

630
00:46:54,488 --> 00:46:56,656
I am seeing symbols ever since I...

631
00:46:57,867 --> 00:47:01,870
- Since what?
- Ever since I touched the Cube splinter.

632
00:47:01,954 --> 00:47:03,955
- Do you have it?
- Yeah, I have it.

633
00:47:04,039 --> 00:47:07,917
- It's in the shop safe. It's fine.
- Mikaela, do not touch it, okay?

634
00:47:08,002 --> 00:47:09,544
- Don't touch it.
- I'm not gonna touch it.

635
00:47:09,879 --> 00:47:11,463
Sam, it's fine. It's locked away.

636
00:47:11,547 --> 00:47:13,881
- No one knows where it is.
- I do!

637
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:18,719
You're hot, but you ain't too bright.

638
00:47:20,388 --> 00:47:22,890
There we go. Yeah, that'll work.

639
00:47:25,143 --> 00:47:27,227
Damn it! Son of a bitch!

640
00:47:29,439 --> 00:47:32,232
What are you looking at, slobber puss?

641
00:47:33,151 --> 00:47:36,778
What the... This place is
a freaking house of horrors!

642
00:47:39,908 --> 00:47:41,742
Pain... It hurts...

643
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:44,286
Hold on.

644
00:47:46,956 --> 00:47:49,333
Right to five, then...

645
00:47:57,634 --> 00:48:00,844
Is that the best you got, huh?
Is that the best you can do?

646
00:48:02,305 --> 00:48:04,431
What are you doing here,
you little freak?

647
00:48:04,516 --> 00:48:07,059
That's my eye, you crazy bitch!

648
00:48:07,143 --> 00:48:11,355
- You gonna talk now?
- I seek knowledge from the Cube.

649
00:48:11,439 --> 00:48:13,190
- The Fallen demands me!
- What knowledge?

650
00:48:13,274 --> 00:48:15,901
You got the shard, I need the shard.
Give me the shard. I need the shard.

651
00:48:15,985 --> 00:48:18,529
They're gonna whack me!
I'm gonna be dead without that shard!

652
00:48:18,613 --> 00:48:21,698
Easy, warrior goddess,
I'm just a little salvage-scrap drone!

653
00:48:21,783 --> 00:48:25,077
- And I'm your worst nightmare.
- Hey, hey, hey!

654
00:48:25,161 --> 00:48:26,578
- What the hell was that?
- I'll tell you later,

655
00:48:26,663 --> 00:48:28,205
just not on an open phone line, okay?

656
00:48:28,289 --> 00:48:29,248
I'm gonna get on a plane right now

657
00:48:29,332 --> 00:48:31,542
and I'll be there later this afternoon.
Just be careful, Sam.

658
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:42,593
And have any strangers given you
anything suspicious to carry on today?

659
00:48:42,678 --> 00:48:44,387
Yeah, a live bomb!

660
00:48:44,471 --> 00:48:45,763
- No.
- Good.

661
00:48:58,485 --> 00:49:01,070
Major, incoming SOS from Autobots!

662
00:49:01,154 --> 00:49:04,949
Multiple Decepticon contacts in motion.
Vicinity, eastern United States, sir!

663
00:49:05,033 --> 00:49:08,035
- As in how many?
- Unclear, sir.

664
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,495
Well, get clear.

665
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:17,044
The Autobots are on the move,
splitting into two teams, sir.

666
00:49:17,129 --> 00:49:18,212
They're not answering our calls

667
00:49:18,297 --> 00:49:19,880
and they're heading to
New York and Philadelphia.

668
00:49:19,965 --> 00:49:23,175
All right, full weapons deployment.
Wheels up in 20 minutes!

669
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:25,219
Move it!

670
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:28,472
Let's go!

671
00:49:33,729 --> 00:49:36,856
Flight 57, welcome to Philadelphia.

672
00:49:37,524 --> 00:49:41,027
Alicia, mi amor, can I interest you
in an 18-inch Zookeeper's special?

673
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,613
Extra-large, triple cheese,
with every known animal as a topping.

674
00:49:43,697 --> 00:49:45,740
Basically, I've got,
like, 18 inches of meat.

675
00:49:45,824 --> 00:49:48,409
Unless you're vegetarian.
All right. It's cool. I am, too.

676
00:49:48,493 --> 00:49:51,787
- Sam home?
- Sam? I think he died,

677
00:49:51,872 --> 00:49:53,164
but why don't we check?

678
00:49:53,248 --> 00:49:55,124
- Here we are.
- Hey!

679
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:56,375
You ever have a song stuck
in your head? It's like

680
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,419
the worst song ever,
but you can't help to whistle it or sing it

681
00:49:58,503 --> 00:50:02,173
'cause it, like, repeats itself, repeats
itself, repeats itself, repeats itself?

682
00:50:02,257 --> 00:50:04,382
Kitten calendar,
kitten calendar, kitten calendar,

683
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:05,800
- kitten calendar...
- Dude, what the eff?

684
00:50:05,885 --> 00:50:07,969
I know you're freaking out.
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

685
00:50:08,054 --> 00:50:10,138
Easy fix. Puzzle code in my head.

686
00:50:10,222 --> 00:50:11,806
Now it's on the walls.
Everything is good.

687
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:13,975
This is the part that...

688
00:50:17,688 --> 00:50:18,855
Okay, what were you saying?

689
00:50:18,939 --> 00:50:22,317
Alice, I'm horrified you had to see this.
Let's go.

690
00:50:22,401 --> 00:50:23,735
Get out.

691
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:25,654
Wait, wait, wait!
Can I just sit and watch?

692
00:50:25,738 --> 00:50:27,864
I'll... I'll eat my pizza quietly.

693
00:50:27,948 --> 00:50:30,867
Sam, I knew there was
something special about you.

694
00:50:30,951 --> 00:50:32,243
Really?

695
00:50:33,704 --> 00:50:35,872
And I know you know what happens

696
00:50:35,956 --> 00:50:38,875
when two people in the know
get together.

697
00:50:38,959 --> 00:50:42,253
They're genuinely amazing in bed.

698
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:45,548
Thank you.

699
00:50:46,801 --> 00:50:48,343
All right, listen, hold on! Boundaries.

700
00:50:48,427 --> 00:50:53,515
- Flag on the play. Okay. I'm very ticklish.
- We have needs, Sam. Relax.

701
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:54,808
Jeez!

702
00:50:56,727 --> 00:50:59,813
What about this economy?
It's crazy, isn't it?

703
00:51:01,732 --> 00:51:04,943
- You are very aggressive.
- Just relax.

704
00:51:05,069 --> 00:51:07,362
You want some turkey meatloaf?

705
00:51:12,368 --> 00:51:13,660
Sam?

706
00:51:15,955 --> 00:51:18,540
- Mikaela!
- Is that your girlfriend?

707
00:51:19,792 --> 00:51:20,792
Ex.

708
00:51:21,752 --> 00:51:23,962
Mikaela! Wait!

709
00:51:25,756 --> 00:51:27,716
I can explain...

710
00:51:46,151 --> 00:51:48,193
Sam, your bed buddy, Alice...

711
00:52:07,213 --> 00:52:08,255
All right, come on.

712
00:52:08,339 --> 00:52:09,882
- She's coming!
- She's an alien robot! You gotta move.

713
00:52:09,966 --> 00:52:11,300
- Is this real?
- Just run!

714
00:52:17,557 --> 00:52:20,517
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I can't believe
I almost had sex with her in my dream!

715
00:52:20,602 --> 00:52:22,311
I can tell
that you really missed me a lot, Sam!

716
00:52:22,395 --> 00:52:23,771
- Look, it's not my fault, okay?
- It's not your fault?

717
00:52:23,855 --> 00:52:25,272
Listen! Listen, I'm a victim!

718
00:52:25,356 --> 00:52:26,690
- You were a victim? Of what?
- Yeah.

719
00:52:26,775 --> 00:52:28,609
- Of what, a little 80-pound girl?
- Of... Of molestation.

720
00:52:28,693 --> 00:52:30,402
It was like getting humped
in the neck by a mountain ox!

721
00:52:30,487 --> 00:52:31,820
You didn't have to put your tongue
in her mouth!

722
00:52:31,905 --> 00:52:33,030
- I didn't! Look!
- You did!

723
00:52:33,114 --> 00:52:35,616
You ever had your stomach tongued by
a mountain ox with a five-foot tongue?

724
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,869
It's not fun for me, okay, Mikaela?
And it smelled like... Like diesel!

725
00:52:38,995 --> 00:52:42,289
- Like a diesel-y tinge to it!
- You're such a little girl!

726
00:52:42,373 --> 00:52:44,291
We're gonna have
10 seconds of silence right now.

727
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:45,584
I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds.

728
00:52:45,668 --> 00:52:47,503
You can't give me the silent treatment!
You know what?

729
00:52:47,587 --> 00:52:50,130
I'm not talking to you for 10 seconds.
You have three seconds left.

730
00:52:50,215 --> 00:52:51,423
You know what?
You can give me the silent treatment

731
00:52:51,508 --> 00:52:53,258
all you want,
but you can't keep me from talking.

732
00:52:53,551 --> 00:52:55,134
- What were you gonna say?
- I hope you had a lot of fun,

733
00:52:55,219 --> 00:52:57,136
because this, this is over.

734
00:52:57,221 --> 00:52:59,639
She violated your orifice
with her nasty alien probe?

735
00:52:59,723 --> 00:53:01,974
She did it? She went in there?
All her little embryo alien babies

736
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:04,894
are gestating and hatching inside of you.
They're growing right now, probably!

737
00:53:04,978 --> 00:53:07,772
You need to vomit it right now.
Yak it! Yak it right now!

738
00:53:07,856 --> 00:53:08,981
Who are you?

739
00:53:09,066 --> 00:53:12,151
I'm Leonardo Ponce De Leon Spitz.
Okay? I'm the key to this.

740
00:53:12,236 --> 00:53:13,861
The aliens,
they want me 'cause of my site.

741
00:53:19,952 --> 00:53:20,952
Whoa, guys, right there!

742
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:26,499
Run!

743
00:53:30,379 --> 00:53:31,587
Mikaela!

744
00:53:49,314 --> 00:53:51,357
Come on! We gotta move!

745
00:53:51,859 --> 00:53:53,609
It's a bomb!

746
00:54:02,828 --> 00:54:04,120
You've got to get that box!

747
00:54:07,708 --> 00:54:10,835
- This way.
- What? Hey! Let me out, let me out!

748
00:54:11,962 --> 00:54:14,714
Oh, my God, you know how to
hot-wire a car? That's so hot!

749
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:17,008
Drive, drive, drive!
She's right there! She's right there!

750
00:54:17,092 --> 00:54:19,885
Come on, come on, come on.

751
00:54:20,303 --> 00:54:22,637
Go! Go! Go! Back up the car!

752
00:54:23,806 --> 00:54:25,056
Now!

753
00:54:26,642 --> 00:54:27,976
Tongue!

754
00:54:32,607 --> 00:54:34,274
Oh, my God!

755
00:54:41,532 --> 00:54:43,283
Kiss this, bitch!

756
00:54:48,539 --> 00:54:50,540
Drive, drive, drive.

757
00:54:53,336 --> 00:54:54,544
Okay, so what else
don't I know, all right?

758
00:54:54,629 --> 00:54:56,338
Since you guys forgot to mention
some minor details.

759
00:54:59,008 --> 00:55:02,052
That thing you saw back there,
that was the little baby...

760
00:55:07,433 --> 00:55:09,809
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Sam!

761
00:55:12,855 --> 00:55:14,272
Sam!

762
00:55:18,611 --> 00:55:19,945
- Sam!
- Hold on!

763
00:55:20,029 --> 00:55:21,363
- Pull me up!
- Hold on!

764
00:55:23,616 --> 00:55:25,533
Sam, get back in!

765
00:55:27,203 --> 00:55:30,372
I don't want to die!
We're gonna die! Oh, my God!

766
00:55:55,814 --> 00:55:57,564
Jesus! Jesus!

767
00:56:05,573 --> 00:56:07,366
Come here, boy.

768
00:56:08,618 --> 00:56:09,952
Closer.

769
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:11,829
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

770
00:56:11,913 --> 00:56:14,331
You remember me, don't you?

771
00:56:14,416 --> 00:56:16,875
I did what you said, okay?
Just don't hurt us.

772
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:18,252
Shut up!

773
00:56:19,087 --> 00:56:20,254
Sam!

774
00:56:26,469 --> 00:56:30,472
Yeah! Yes, yes.

775
00:56:30,932 --> 00:56:34,101
It feels good to grab your flesh!

776
00:56:35,645 --> 00:56:40,107
I am going to kill you slowly, painfully,

777
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:44,820
but first, we have
some delicate work to do.

778
00:56:48,116 --> 00:56:50,951
How I could snap your limbs off!

779
00:56:51,036 --> 00:56:54,788
Doctor, examine this alien specimen.

780
00:56:55,248 --> 00:56:58,751
I'll scan you.
Let's take a look at your face.

781
00:57:01,629 --> 00:57:06,550
I'm the doctor. The odd job. Information!

782
00:57:08,636 --> 00:57:09,928
Yeah!

783
00:57:17,603 --> 00:57:19,812
Beseeching my shard!

784
00:57:19,897 --> 00:57:21,731
Easy or tough way?

785
00:57:44,546 --> 00:57:46,464
- There they are.
- That's what I'm seeing in my head.

786
00:57:46,548 --> 00:57:50,426
These symbols can lead us
to the Energon source.

787
00:57:50,511 --> 00:57:54,597
We must have the brain on the table!

788
00:57:54,681 --> 00:57:57,266
- Chop, chop!
- Brain?

789
00:57:57,351 --> 00:57:58,601
What does he mean by my brain?

790
00:57:58,685 --> 00:58:01,604
Well, you have something on your mind,
something I need.

791
00:58:01,688 --> 00:58:03,648
Hold on. I know you're pissed.
I know you're pissed

792
00:58:03,732 --> 00:58:05,650
because I tried to kill you
and it's completely understandable.

793
00:58:05,734 --> 00:58:07,151
If somebody tried to kill me,
I'd be upset, too.

794
00:58:07,236 --> 00:58:09,821
I think that we have an opportunity here

795
00:58:09,905 --> 00:58:13,032
to start anew
and develop our relationship

796
00:58:13,117 --> 00:58:15,409
and see where it leads us, okay?

797
00:58:15,494 --> 00:58:18,621
So, you just call Doctor Inspector off
and let's just talk for five seconds!

798
00:58:18,705 --> 00:58:19,914
Wait, wait, wait!

799
00:58:25,546 --> 00:58:28,923
- Come on! Go, go!
- Sam!

800
00:58:31,176 --> 00:58:32,885
Go, go, go!

801
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,245
Sam!

802
00:59:07,879 --> 00:59:09,087
Run!

803
00:59:16,137 --> 00:59:17,596
Go, go, go, go!

804
00:59:18,431 --> 00:59:19,973
Here he comes!

805
00:59:26,772 --> 00:59:28,190
Hide, Sam!

806
00:59:38,784 --> 00:59:40,327
Weak!

807
00:59:42,163 --> 00:59:45,582
Puny! Waste of metal!

808
00:59:48,544 --> 00:59:50,962
Junkyard crap!

809
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:54,299
Decepticons!

810
01:00:04,893 --> 01:00:06,852
Come here, boy.

811
01:00:38,385 --> 01:00:41,762
There is another source of
Energon hidden on this planet.

812
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,931
The boy could lead us to it.

813
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:02,283
Optimus!

814
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:20,884
Is the future of our race not worth
a single human life?

815
01:01:20,969 --> 01:01:24,722
- Up! Get up!
- You'll never stop at one!

816
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:28,349
I'll take you all on!

817
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,101
Piece of tin!

818
01:02:14,104 --> 01:02:15,980
Sam! Where are you?

819
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:19,734
No!

820
01:02:20,402 --> 01:02:22,945
You're so weak!

821
01:02:50,432 --> 01:02:54,559
The last Prime is dead!

822
01:03:03,611 --> 01:03:08,156
Sam, run. Run.

823
01:03:18,334 --> 01:03:20,168
Autobots, attack!

824
01:03:24,841 --> 01:03:27,175
Bumblebee, get them out of here!

825
01:03:40,398 --> 01:03:41,940
This is Lennox.

826
01:03:53,995 --> 01:03:57,956
- That went well.
- We've lost the boy, Master.

827
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:00,542
The Autobots
must be shielding their signals.

828
01:04:00,626 --> 01:04:04,880
I can't even rely on you
to swat a simple insect?

829
01:04:06,424 --> 01:04:09,259
- One insect among seven billion!
- Shut up!

830
01:04:11,012 --> 01:04:13,013
He could be anywhere.

831
01:04:13,097 --> 01:04:16,558
Then we will force them
to find him for us!

832
01:04:17,225 --> 01:04:20,311
It's time for the world
to know of our presence.

833
01:04:20,395 --> 01:04:23,522
No more disguises. No mercy!

834
01:04:23,815 --> 01:04:27,526
The time has come
for my master's arrival.

835
01:04:31,656 --> 01:04:36,827
Decepticons, mobilize. It is time.

836
01:04:54,429 --> 01:04:56,680
Speaking French is so exciting!

837
01:04:56,806 --> 01:04:58,474
Oh, God, who is this?

838
01:05:00,435 --> 01:05:03,145
Hello? I mean, bonsoir!

839
01:05:04,648 --> 01:05:07,816
- What? Who is this?
- Where is the boy?

840
01:05:08,235 --> 01:05:12,821
For Pete's sakes. I'm not impressed
with your perverted mouth-breathing.

841
01:05:53,112 --> 01:05:54,070
Jeez!

842
01:05:54,154 --> 01:05:56,739
You are invading my space.
I'm gonna have to drop you.

843
01:05:56,824 --> 01:05:58,032
Would you get out of here?

844
01:05:58,117 --> 01:06:00,368
I didn't come all the way across
the ocean to eat a plate of snails.

845
01:06:00,452 --> 01:06:01,744
I want to try new things.

846
01:06:01,829 --> 01:06:04,205
Looks like Canadian goose poop.

847
01:06:05,583 --> 01:06:06,916
It's nasty.

848
01:07:19,197 --> 01:07:22,532
Revenge is mine.

849
01:07:39,676 --> 01:07:41,593
Yeah!

850
01:07:43,888 --> 01:07:45,847
...definitely not a plane...

851
01:07:45,932 --> 01:07:48,016
Look, carriers don't just sink.

852
01:07:48,101 --> 01:07:51,228
...a horrible accident or a terrorist
attack or worse...

853
01:07:51,562 --> 01:07:53,522
Negative. NORAD confirmed,

854
01:07:53,606 --> 01:07:57,943
projectile came from beyond our
atmosphere, inbound at 30,000 knots.

855
01:08:12,458 --> 01:08:15,711
Citizens of the human hive,

856
01:08:15,795 --> 01:08:19,214
your leaders have withheld the truth.

857
01:08:19,549 --> 01:08:22,843
You are not alone in this universe.

858
01:08:23,553 --> 01:08:26,638
We have lived among you, hidden,

859
01:08:28,307 --> 01:08:30,308
but no more.

860
01:08:30,643 --> 01:08:35,312
As you've seen,
we can destroy your cities at will,

861
01:08:37,274 --> 01:08:40,484
unless you turn over this boy.

862
01:08:45,449 --> 01:08:51,829
If you resist us, we will destroy
the world as you know it.

863
01:08:52,497 --> 01:08:54,039
What we're hearing
from the German government

864
01:08:54,124 --> 01:08:57,168
is that the world broadcast
was a satellite hacking.

865
01:08:57,252 --> 01:09:00,588
The military has just told us they have
assumed Condition Delta,

866
01:09:00,881 --> 01:09:03,424
which is the highest level
we have been at since 9/11.

867
01:09:03,508 --> 01:09:05,468
President Obama
is being flown to a bunker

868
01:09:05,552 --> 01:09:07,219
somewhere in the middle
of the United States

869
01:09:07,304 --> 01:09:11,766
in the face of the worst simultaneous
attacks ever around the globe.

870
01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:17,229
The aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt goes
down off the East Coast, all hands lost.

871
01:09:17,314 --> 01:09:20,483
Worldwide casualties
are in the neighborhood of 7,000,

872
01:09:20,567 --> 01:09:22,276
but that number could climb.

873
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:23,402
It's still too early to tell.

874
01:09:23,487 --> 01:09:25,905
What we need to ask now is,
"Who and why?"

875
01:09:25,989 --> 01:09:28,908
The FBI is still trying to locate
the boy, Sam Witwicky.

876
01:09:28,992 --> 01:09:31,702
We believe they have information
about the attacks.

877
01:09:31,787 --> 01:09:34,121
The FBI, CIA and Interpol

878
01:09:34,206 --> 01:09:37,541
are all seeking the cooperation
of worldwide law enforcement.

879
01:09:37,626 --> 01:09:39,752
You need to listen to this, man.
You gotta check this out.

880
01:09:39,836 --> 01:09:42,463
- They have a traffic-camera spotting...
- They have a picture of me, man.

881
01:09:42,547 --> 01:09:45,966
We're dead, bro.
FBI, CIA, we are wanted fugitives now!

882
01:09:46,218 --> 01:09:47,259
I just need you to focus

883
01:09:47,344 --> 01:09:48,302
- for one minute, man.
- Just stop.

884
01:09:48,386 --> 01:09:49,970
This thing has blown up
to a whole other level, all right?

885
01:09:50,055 --> 01:09:51,722
You know what? Give me this thing.
They can track us.

886
01:09:51,807 --> 01:09:53,766
- Do you see this?
- What?

887
01:09:55,393 --> 01:09:58,521
They can track us?
Like, satellite track us?

888
01:09:59,230 --> 01:10:00,563
Okay, I'm not even with you guys!

889
01:10:00,648 --> 01:10:02,982
Technically, I'm like a hostage.
This is kidnapping...

890
01:10:03,067 --> 01:10:04,359
- Enough is...
- Yo, Leo!

891
01:10:04,693 --> 01:10:06,820
This thing's gonna
give me a heart attack, I swear.

892
01:10:06,904 --> 01:10:09,280
- That's 'cause you is a wuss.
- You guys forced me into that car, right?

893
01:10:09,365 --> 01:10:10,323
I think he's scared.

894
01:10:10,407 --> 01:10:12,951
Hey, Mudflap, what are we gonna do
with this shrimp taco?

895
01:10:13,035 --> 01:10:14,369
Let's pop a cap in his ass,
throw him in the trunk

896
01:10:14,453 --> 01:10:15,995
and then nobody gonna know nothing,
know what I mean?

897
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,998
- Not in my trunk.
- Yo, bumper cars? I'm hearing you.

898
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:21,292
Okay? I'm right here and I can hear you!

899
01:10:21,377 --> 01:10:23,545
No one's popping any caps
in any asses, okay?

900
01:10:23,629 --> 01:10:25,171
I've had a hell of a day!

901
01:10:26,257 --> 01:10:28,675
Why don't you get a haircut
with your bitch ass?

902
01:10:28,759 --> 01:10:29,884
Go whine to your boyfriend!

903
01:10:29,969 --> 01:10:32,178
Listen, Sam, I know what I'm gonna do,
man. Look, I'm just going to go

904
01:10:32,263 --> 01:10:33,304
to the authorities and tell them the truth.

905
01:10:33,389 --> 01:10:34,389
Like, I had nothing to do with this.

906
01:10:34,473 --> 01:10:36,015
- So, I'm not an accomplice.
- Hey, you wanted this, right?

907
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,433
You wanted the real deal?
Well, that's what this is.

908
01:10:37,518 --> 01:10:38,852
Wake up! You're in the middle of it!

909
01:10:38,936 --> 01:10:41,271
You want to run? Go ahead!
No one's stopping you.

910
01:10:42,273 --> 01:10:43,898
Stop complaining.

911
01:11:20,144 --> 01:11:21,644
What is the meaning of this?

912
01:11:21,979 --> 01:11:23,897
You dare point a gun at me?

913
01:11:23,981 --> 01:11:27,733
You want a piece of me?
I will tear you apart!

914
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:32,112
Drop your weapons! Drop your weapons!

915
01:11:32,196 --> 01:11:33,655
- Tell them to lower their weapons!
- Tell them first.

916
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:34,781
Tell them to lower their weapons.

917
01:11:34,866 --> 01:11:36,867
Major, there's nothing I can do.
Talk to him.

918
01:11:36,951 --> 01:11:38,827
Your NEST team is deactivated, Major.

919
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:41,830
You are to cease
anti-Decepticon operations

920
01:11:41,915 --> 01:11:44,249
and return to Diego Garcia
pending further orders.

921
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:46,710
No, we take our orders directly
from Chairman Morshower, sir.

922
01:11:46,794 --> 01:11:48,587
Well, I'll see your Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

923
01:11:48,671 --> 01:11:51,173
and I will raise you
a President of the United States.

924
01:11:51,257 --> 01:11:52,716
I have operational command now.

925
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:55,010
An alien blood feud
has been brought to our shores

926
01:11:55,094 --> 01:11:56,720
for which our soldiers
are paying the price.

927
01:11:57,221 --> 01:11:58,847
The secret is out!

928
01:11:58,932 --> 01:12:02,392
This is our war now and we will win it
as we always have,

929
01:12:02,477 --> 01:12:04,394
with a coordinated military strategy.

930
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:07,439
This fool is terribly misinformed.

931
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:08,899
You're gonna need every asset
that you've got.

932
01:12:08,983 --> 01:12:10,692
What we need is to draw up battle plans

933
01:12:10,777 --> 01:12:12,945
while we explore
every possible diplomatic solution.

934
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,529
Like what, handing over the kid?

935
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:17,699
All options are being considered.

936
01:12:18,326 --> 01:12:22,245
Whatever the Decepticons are after,
this is just the start.

937
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:25,415
- There is no negotiating with them.
- I'm ordering you to stand down.

938
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:29,586
You won't be needing this anymore.
Get your assets back to base!

939
01:12:29,671 --> 01:12:32,881
And take that pile of scrap metal back
to Diego Garcia.

940
01:12:34,092 --> 01:12:35,425
Let's go!

941
01:12:36,386 --> 01:12:40,597
I really don't like that dude.
He's an asshole.

942
01:12:40,682 --> 01:12:43,183
Autobots, report to hangar for transport.

943
01:12:43,267 --> 01:12:48,605
- Ironhide, we should leave this planet.
- That's not what Optimus would want.

944
01:13:07,749 --> 01:13:09,792
There's nothing
that you could have done.

945
01:13:14,423 --> 01:13:16,507
- You okay?
- Yeah.

946
01:13:19,678 --> 01:13:22,513
Bee, if you hate me, I understand.

947
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:33,482
I messed up. I'm sorry.

948
01:13:35,527 --> 01:13:39,405
Young fella, you are the person
I care about most in my life.

949
01:13:39,489 --> 01:13:42,575
If there's anything you need,
I won't be far away.

950
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:48,539
He's dead because of me. He came
here to protect me and he's dead.

951
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:51,709
There's some things
you just can't change.

952
01:13:51,793 --> 01:13:55,963
So, his sacrifice for us would
not have been in vain. Hallelujah!

953
01:13:57,299 --> 01:13:59,550
I'm gonna make it right.
I'm going to turn myself in.

954
01:13:59,634 --> 01:14:01,802
We... We've got to stick together.

955
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:10,144
- You're not going to do that.
- Yes, I am.

956
01:14:14,232 --> 01:14:17,984
Everything we worked for
will be wiped out in one day!

957
01:14:20,613 --> 01:14:22,781
- You two...
- Huh?

958
01:14:22,865 --> 01:14:23,990
Hey, you know the glyphs?

959
01:14:24,075 --> 01:14:26,534
These? The symbols that have been
rattling around in my head?

960
01:14:27,369 --> 01:14:31,331
That's old school, yo.
That's, like... That's Cybertronian.

961
01:14:31,665 --> 01:14:32,957
That's some serious stuff, right there.

962
01:14:33,042 --> 01:14:36,086
They gotta mean something,
like a message or like a map.

963
01:14:36,170 --> 01:14:37,587
Like a map to an Energon source!

964
01:14:37,671 --> 01:14:40,924
- Can you read this?
- Read?

965
01:14:41,008 --> 01:14:43,301
No. We don't really do much reading.
Not so much.

966
01:14:43,385 --> 01:14:45,428
If you can't read it,
we gotta find somebody who can.

967
01:14:45,513 --> 01:14:47,138
Look who came sashaying back!

968
01:14:47,223 --> 01:14:48,807
Hair growing like a Chia Pet.
Look at him.

969
01:14:48,891 --> 01:14:50,725
I had a bit
of a mild panic attack earlier, right?

970
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:51,935
That's 'cause you're a pussy.

971
01:14:52,019 --> 01:14:53,895
I think I'm allowed that,
considering what I've been through.

972
01:14:54,522 --> 01:14:55,605
I heard you have a problem.

973
01:14:55,689 --> 01:14:58,691
- I think I know someone who can help.
- Who?

974
01:14:58,776 --> 01:14:59,943
Robo-Warrior.

975
01:15:03,531 --> 01:15:04,739
This guy, Robo-Warrior,

976
01:15:04,824 --> 01:15:07,200
everything about anything alien,
he's supposed to know.

977
01:15:07,326 --> 01:15:08,660
One time we revenge-hacked his site

978
01:15:08,744 --> 01:15:13,164
and maybe I saw some
of your alien drawings or whatever.

979
01:15:25,719 --> 01:15:27,554
This is it. Yep.

980
01:15:27,638 --> 01:15:28,805
Deli. Good front!

981
01:15:29,223 --> 01:15:31,724
All right, wait here.
I'll give you the go/no go. All right?

982
01:15:32,226 --> 01:15:34,894
Number 42, we got your kishka, knish,

983
01:15:34,979 --> 01:15:38,106
kasha-varnishka
and kreplach combo right here.

984
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:39,524
Cash only. Who's next?

985
01:15:39,608 --> 01:15:42,901
I told you to cure the lox in the brine
and then smoke it.

986
01:15:42,986 --> 01:15:44,570
Ma, you want me
to cut my hand off, or what?

987
01:15:44,654 --> 01:15:46,155
You... You ruined
a beautiful piece of fish, you retard!

988
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:47,573
I'm like a ninja with a blade.
It's an art form.

989
01:15:47,657 --> 01:15:48,866
Give me your money. Get out of here!

990
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:52,870
Hey, Sal! Watch your reach, huh?
Take a number, young man.

991
01:15:53,454 --> 01:15:54,872
Robo-Warrior.

992
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:58,750
- Know him?
- I never heard of him.

993
01:15:58,835 --> 01:16:01,170
You never heard of
TheRealEffingDeal. Com?

994
01:16:01,254 --> 01:16:03,797
You must be talking about that
amateur-hour blog operation

995
01:16:03,882 --> 01:16:07,009
- with Game Boy-level security.
- Robo-Warrior.

996
01:16:08,136 --> 01:16:10,971
It's him! It's him!
That's the guy right there! That's him!

997
01:16:12,223 --> 01:16:13,473
No.

998
01:16:14,142 --> 01:16:16,351
- You got to be kidding me.
- All right, meat store's closed!

999
01:16:16,436 --> 01:16:18,812
- Everybody out! Out, right now!
- When he says to go,

1000
01:16:18,897 --> 01:16:20,480
- you go.
- That means you, lady, right now.

1001
01:16:20,565 --> 01:16:22,691
- Wait a minute. You know this guy?
- We're old friends.

1002
01:16:22,775 --> 01:16:26,236
Old friends? You're the case
that shut down Sector Seven,

1003
01:16:26,321 --> 01:16:27,654
got the kibosh, disbanded.

1004
01:16:27,739 --> 01:16:30,991
No more security clearance,
no retirement, no nothing.

1005
01:16:31,075 --> 01:16:34,036
All 'cause of you
and your little criminal girlfriend.

1006
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:38,415
- Look at her now, so mature.
- Moron! Where's the whitefish?

1007
01:16:38,499 --> 01:16:40,375
Hey! Don't touch me with the pig.

1008
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,044
- Yakov!
- What?

1009
01:16:42,128 --> 01:16:44,171
You don't get
Christmas bonuses standing around!

1010
01:16:44,255 --> 01:16:46,048
You want those new teeth
you saw on SkyMall?

1011
01:16:46,132 --> 01:16:48,342
- It's my dream.
- Help her out.

1012
01:16:48,968 --> 01:16:50,010
You live with your mama?

1013
01:16:50,094 --> 01:16:51,428
No, my mama lives with me.
It's a big difference.

1014
01:16:51,512 --> 01:16:53,388
They got your face all over the news,
alien boy.

1015
01:16:53,473 --> 01:16:55,849
- Yeah, I know.
- And NBE One's still kicking, huh?

1016
01:16:55,934 --> 01:16:58,101
How did that happen? Don't answer.

1017
01:16:58,186 --> 01:17:00,562
I don't know what you're hiding,
but I don't want anything to do with it.

1018
01:17:00,647 --> 01:17:03,398
So, good-bye. You never saw me.
I got bagels to schmear. Vanish.

1019
01:17:03,483 --> 01:17:05,942
Can you give me five seconds?
Look, hold on, I need your help.

1020
01:17:06,026 --> 01:17:08,611
Really? You need my help?

1021
01:17:08,695 --> 01:17:11,322
I need...
Look, I am slowly losing my mind.

1022
01:17:11,406 --> 01:17:13,032
Okay, I had a little crab-bot,

1023
01:17:13,116 --> 01:17:15,243
plunged a device deep into
the soft tissues of my brain

1024
01:17:15,327 --> 01:17:18,162
and started projecting little alien
symbols like a freaking home movie!

1025
01:17:18,247 --> 01:17:20,998
And on top of that, I'm a wanted fugitive.
So, you think you got it rough?

1026
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:23,251
You said it projected images
off your brain?

1027
01:17:23,335 --> 01:17:25,920
- Right.
- Meat locker, now!

1028
01:17:26,672 --> 01:17:27,922
Dead pigs.

1029
01:17:28,006 --> 01:17:30,174
What you're about to see is top secret.

1030
01:17:30,926 --> 01:17:32,969
Do not tell my mother.

1031
01:17:34,096 --> 01:17:36,097
- Swine flu. Not good.
- Now you know.

1032
01:17:36,181 --> 01:17:39,141
Next time you eat a goat or a pig,
there's a story behind it.

1033
01:17:39,226 --> 01:17:40,518
Sad little story.

1034
01:17:40,602 --> 01:17:41,769
An entire city flat.
How do you explain that?

1035
01:17:41,853 --> 01:17:42,937
Are you saying you believe
in aliens now?

1036
01:17:43,021 --> 01:17:46,190
Okay, files, files.
We're talking about symbols.

1037
01:17:46,858 --> 01:17:49,485
Hey, still radioactive. Hands off.

1038
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:52,196
Okay, Cube-brain.

1039
01:17:52,823 --> 01:17:55,032
Any of these look
like the symbols you saw?

1040
01:17:55,117 --> 01:17:56,450
Where'd you get these?

1041
01:17:56,535 --> 01:18:00,204
Before I got fired,
I poached S-7's crown jewel,

1042
01:18:00,289 --> 01:18:05,668
over 75 years of alien research,
which points to one inescapable fact.

1043
01:18:05,752 --> 01:18:09,714
The Transformers,
they've been here a long, long time.

1044
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:11,215
How do I know?

1045
01:18:12,384 --> 01:18:14,218
Archeologists found
these unexplained markings

1046
01:18:14,303 --> 01:18:16,554
in ancient ruins all over the world.

1047
01:18:16,972 --> 01:18:19,056
China. Egypt. Greece.

1048
01:18:20,017 --> 01:18:21,600
Shot in 1932.

1049
01:18:21,685 --> 01:18:23,519
These the symbols
you're seeing in your head?

1050
01:18:23,603 --> 01:18:26,188
- Yeah.
- Same ones over here, right?

1051
01:18:26,273 --> 01:18:31,067
So, tell me, how did they end up
all drawing the same things?

1052
01:18:32,069 --> 01:18:35,071
Aliens. And I think some of them stayed.

1053
01:18:35,156 --> 01:18:38,074
Check this out. Project Black Knife.

1054
01:18:38,576 --> 01:18:43,038
Robots in disguise,
hiding here all along.

1055
01:18:43,122 --> 01:18:46,416
We detected radioactive signatures
all across the country.

1056
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:50,003
I pleaded on my knees with S-7
to investigate it,

1057
01:18:50,087 --> 01:18:53,631
but they said the readings
were infinitesimal,

1058
01:18:53,716 --> 01:18:56,176
that I was obsessed.

1059
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:58,011
Me. Can you imagine that?

1060
01:18:58,095 --> 01:19:01,222
Yeah. Megatron said that there
was another Energon source here.

1061
01:19:01,307 --> 01:19:03,183
- On Earth. Another source?
- On Earth.

1062
01:19:03,267 --> 01:19:06,144
Okay? And that these symbols,
maps in my head, would lead him there.

1063
01:19:06,228 --> 01:19:07,979
You talk to your Autobot friends
about this?

1064
01:19:08,064 --> 01:19:09,356
No, no, no, the source is before them.

1065
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:11,274
Whatever the Energon source is,
it predates them.

1066
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,442
It's before them.

1067
01:19:12,526 --> 01:19:14,527
- So, it comes before them.
- Correct.

1068
01:19:14,612 --> 01:19:17,989
Well, then we're porked,
unless we can talk to a Decepticon.

1069
01:19:18,324 --> 01:19:20,158
I mean,
I'm not on speaking terms with them.

1070
01:19:20,242 --> 01:19:21,951
Actually, I am.

1071
01:19:26,624 --> 01:19:27,999
Let me out!

1072
01:19:28,084 --> 01:19:30,335
- This is going to be a little bit sad.
- Open it.

1073
01:19:31,962 --> 01:19:34,172
I will have so many Decepticons
on your butt!

1074
01:19:34,256 --> 01:19:35,715
Hey, behave!

1075
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,634
- What is it, a Decepticon?
- Yeah.

1076
01:19:37,718 --> 01:19:39,511
- And you're training him?
- I'm trying to.

1077
01:19:40,179 --> 01:19:43,098
I spent my whole adult life combing
the planet for aliens,

1078
01:19:43,391 --> 01:19:46,518
and you're carrying around one
in your purse like a little Chihuahua.

1079
01:19:47,103 --> 01:19:49,562
Do you want a throwdown,
you pubic 'fro-head?

1080
01:19:49,647 --> 01:19:52,816
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry about your eye, you know,

1081
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:56,027
but, if you're a good boy,
then I'm not gonna torch your other eye.

1082
01:19:56,112 --> 01:19:57,528
Okay? I'm not gonna torch it.

1083
01:19:57,612 --> 01:20:00,989
Just tell me
what these symbols are, please.

1084
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,200
All right.

1085
01:20:04,911 --> 01:20:07,538
I know that.
That's the language of the Primes.

1086
01:20:08,456 --> 01:20:11,125
I don't read it, but these guys...

1087
01:20:11,209 --> 01:20:13,710
Where the frick did you find photos
of these guys?

1088
01:20:13,795 --> 01:20:17,589
- Is this they?
- Yeah. Seekers, pal. Oldest of the old.

1089
01:20:18,007 --> 01:20:21,260
They've been here thousands of years,
looking for something. I don't know what.

1090
01:20:21,344 --> 01:20:24,847
Nobody tells me nothing, but they'll
translate those symbols for you.

1091
01:20:24,931 --> 01:20:27,266
- And I know where to find them.
- Show us.

1092
01:20:27,350 --> 01:20:28,684
Yeah.

1093
01:20:32,355 --> 01:20:34,356
The closest one's in Washington.

1094
01:20:36,693 --> 01:20:41,697
Smithsonian Air and Space Museum.
Land of dreams in there.

1095
01:20:42,532 --> 01:20:44,450
All I ever wanted to be was an astronaut.

1096
01:20:46,411 --> 01:20:48,495
- Hold those.
- What is that?

1097
01:20:49,372 --> 01:20:51,498
What? I wear them when I'm in a funk.

1098
01:20:52,542 --> 01:20:56,086
So does Giambi, Jeter.
It's a baseball thing. Okay.

1099
01:20:56,171 --> 01:20:57,671
Watches synchronized,
sharp mind and empty bladder.

1100
01:20:58,631 --> 01:21:01,633
You get caught, demand an attorney
and don't ever say my name.

1101
01:21:01,718 --> 01:21:03,469
Okay, take one of these pills.
Slip it under your tongue.

1102
01:21:03,553 --> 01:21:05,846
It's the high-concentrate polymer
they put in Oreo cookies.

1103
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:07,639
Tricks the polygraph every time.

1104
01:21:07,724 --> 01:21:09,475
Okay. Now, let's get this show
on the road.

1105
01:21:10,435 --> 01:21:12,019
No, listen, I can't do this.

1106
01:21:12,103 --> 01:21:14,021
I'm not some alien bounty hunter, guys.
I'm not gonna do this.

1107
01:21:14,105 --> 01:21:16,648
- Guards have guns. I don't want to die.
- Kid, kid, kid.

1108
01:21:16,733 --> 01:21:19,651
You compromise this mission,
you are dead to me.

1109
01:21:19,736 --> 01:21:22,320
Now look into my eyes
and tighten up that sphincter.

1110
01:21:23,447 --> 01:21:24,655
The museum is now closing.

1111
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:27,658
Yo, baba! Bad news, bro!
Ran out of toilet paper!

1112
01:21:27,743 --> 01:21:29,035
You got any out here?
Please tell me you do.

1113
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:32,121
Sir! I suggest you get in there.
The museum is closed!

1114
01:21:32,206 --> 01:21:34,624
Listen, man, I understand that,
but as you can see, this is important.

1115
01:21:34,708 --> 01:21:36,626
All right? Thumper dumper.
I got to go. All right.

1116
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:39,629
Sir, you are a grown,
naked man around children.

1117
01:21:39,713 --> 01:21:42,632
- Pull your pants up and exit the building.
- I'm not going anywhere.

1118
01:21:47,179 --> 01:21:50,014
- You got that paper, right, sir?
- You should be embarrassed.

1119
01:21:50,098 --> 01:21:52,225
This is a family museum, sir.

1120
01:22:10,202 --> 01:22:11,702
What is going on here?

1121
01:22:11,787 --> 01:22:16,290
How many times can you get tased
in the nuts before you can't have kids?

1122
01:22:16,375 --> 01:22:18,584
You are an amateur, man,
a rank amateur.

1123
01:22:22,464 --> 01:22:24,674
We just downed five guards.
Five guards.

1124
01:22:24,758 --> 01:22:26,425
- Get your stuff and get out of here.
- Give me a second here.

1125
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:28,219
I got to get the tracker, all right.

1126
01:22:28,303 --> 01:22:30,721
- Be good.
- I'm claustrophobic.

1127
01:22:47,572 --> 01:22:50,949
Look, look. Follow him. Follow him.
He knows where he's going.

1128
01:22:56,664 --> 01:22:57,831
- He knows something.
- What?

1129
01:22:57,915 --> 01:22:58,957
He knows something.

1130
01:23:04,964 --> 01:23:05,922
You got what I got?

1131
01:23:06,007 --> 01:23:07,674
- Yeah.
- Blackbird.

1132
01:23:10,761 --> 01:23:12,262
There he is.

1133
01:23:12,346 --> 01:23:15,974
This guy's a legend,
like the Chairman of the Board!

1134
01:23:16,058 --> 01:23:20,270
Yo, freshman, point the shard
and watch the magic happen.

1135
01:23:27,612 --> 01:23:29,404
Shit. It's a Decepticon!

1136
01:23:29,697 --> 01:23:31,865
- Decepticon?
- Decepticon?

1137
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:33,992
Behind the MiG now!

1138
01:23:46,297 --> 01:23:49,299
What sort of hideous
mausoleum is this?

1139
01:23:50,384 --> 01:23:52,636
Answer me, pawns and knaves!

1140
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:56,056
Show yourselves
or suffer my infinite wrath!

1141
01:23:57,266 --> 01:24:00,226
You little spinal-cord-based organisms!

1142
01:24:01,354 --> 01:24:02,604
Bugger it!

1143
01:24:03,105 --> 01:24:07,609
Behold the eternal glory of Jetfire!

1144
01:24:07,985 --> 01:24:10,070
Prepare for remote systems override!

1145
01:24:10,154 --> 01:24:12,696
- I tell you, this guy did not age well.
- I don't think he's gonna hurt us.

1146
01:24:12,781 --> 01:24:15,074
I command these doors to open.

1147
01:24:15,158 --> 01:24:19,119
Fire! I said, fire!

1148
01:24:19,996 --> 01:24:21,330
Bollocks!

1149
01:24:21,414 --> 01:24:25,000
- Damn these worthless parts.
- Wait a second!

1150
01:24:25,085 --> 01:24:28,420
Itchy, wretched rust in my arse!

1151
01:24:29,339 --> 01:24:32,675
The museum is going to be very angry.
Very angry.

1152
01:24:32,759 --> 01:24:34,426
We gotta catch that plane.

1153
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:41,767
- Right. I'm on a mission.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1154
01:24:41,851 --> 01:24:43,686
- What do you want?
- Look, we just want to talk!

1155
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:45,521
I have no time to talk. I'm on a mission.

1156
01:24:45,605 --> 01:24:48,857
I'm a mercenary doom-bringer.
What planet am I on?

1157
01:24:48,942 --> 01:24:50,317
- Earth.
- Earth?

1158
01:24:50,402 --> 01:24:55,447
Terrible name for a planet.
Might as well call it "Dirt." Planet "Dirt."

1159
01:24:55,532 --> 01:24:58,951
Tell me,
is that robot civil war still going on?

1160
01:24:59,035 --> 01:25:00,703
- Who's winning?
- The Decepticons.

1161
01:25:01,788 --> 01:25:05,165
- Well, I changed sides to the Autobots.
- What do you mean, "changed sides"?

1162
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:08,752
It's a choice.
It's an intensely personal decision.

1163
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:12,506
So much negativity.
Who wants to live a life filled with hate?

1164
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:13,590
You mean you don't have to work

1165
01:25:13,675 --> 01:25:15,384
for those miserable,
freaking Decepticons?

1166
01:25:15,468 --> 01:25:19,012
If Decepticons had their way,
they'd destroy the whole universe.

1167
01:25:19,305 --> 01:25:21,890
I'm changing sides. I'm changing sides,
too, warrior goddess.

1168
01:25:21,975 --> 01:25:24,143
- Who's your little Autobot?
- You're cute.

1169
01:25:24,227 --> 01:25:27,271
Name's Wheelie. Yeah.
Say my name, say my name.

1170
01:25:27,897 --> 01:25:29,565
What are you allowing
to happen to your foot just now?

1171
01:25:29,649 --> 01:25:30,774
At least he's faithful, Sam.

1172
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:33,819
Yeah, well, he's faithful and he's nude
and he's perverted.

1173
01:25:35,405 --> 01:25:36,405
Can you just... Can you stop?

1174
01:25:36,489 --> 01:25:37,906
- Hey, what are you doing?
- It's just something

1175
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:39,907
to think about. I won't argue with...
What were you saying?

1176
01:25:39,992 --> 01:25:44,078
I told you my name was Jetfire,
so stop judging me.

1177
01:25:44,163 --> 01:25:45,580
Somebody shit the bed this morning.

1178
01:25:45,664 --> 01:25:47,248
- Look at this guy.
- I have issues of my own.

1179
01:25:47,332 --> 01:25:48,833
And it started with my mother!

1180
01:25:48,917 --> 01:25:51,377
My ancestors
have been here for centuries.

1181
01:25:51,462 --> 01:25:54,422
My father, he was a wheel,
the first wheel.

1182
01:25:54,506 --> 01:25:56,758
- Do you know what he transformed into?
- No.

1183
01:25:56,842 --> 01:25:57,884
Nothing!

1184
01:25:57,968 --> 01:26:01,637
But he did so with honor,
dignity, damn it!

1185
01:26:08,479 --> 01:26:09,479
Bollocks.

1186
01:26:09,855 --> 01:26:12,023
My boosters are fried.

1187
01:26:14,026 --> 01:26:15,234
I think we can help each other.

1188
01:26:15,319 --> 01:26:18,196
You know things I don't know.
I know things you don't know, I do.

1189
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:20,698
I don't think he knows anything.
Honestly, I don't.

1190
01:26:22,493 --> 01:26:24,786
I could do this all day.
It comes in waves, these vivid symbols.

1191
01:26:24,870 --> 01:26:27,830
They're symbols, but they're in my mind.
You see, all this is in my mind

1192
01:26:27,915 --> 01:26:29,791
and Megatron wants what's in my mind.

1193
01:26:29,875 --> 01:26:33,085
- Him and someone called The Fallen.
- The Fallen? I know him.

1194
01:26:33,170 --> 01:26:36,422
He left me here to rust.
The original Decepticon.

1195
01:26:36,507 --> 01:26:40,301
He's terrible to work for.
It's always apocalypse, chaos, crisis.

1196
01:26:40,385 --> 01:26:42,428
These transcriptions,
they were part of my mission,

1197
01:26:42,513 --> 01:26:43,471
The Fallen's search.

1198
01:26:43,555 --> 01:26:47,141
I remember now,
for the Dagger's Tip, and the key.

1199
01:26:47,226 --> 01:26:49,310
Slow down. The Dagger's Tip? The key?
What are you talking about?

1200
01:26:49,394 --> 01:26:53,898
No time to explain. Hold on, everybody!
Stay still or you'll die!

1201
01:27:20,758 --> 01:27:21,842
Well, that wasn't so bad.

1202
01:27:21,926 --> 01:27:23,593
I just hope we're still on the right planet.

1203
01:27:23,678 --> 01:27:25,637
Hey, that freaking hurt!

1204
01:27:26,931 --> 01:27:28,265
Oh, my God.

1205
01:27:35,273 --> 01:27:36,773
Oh, God.

1206
01:27:41,237 --> 01:27:43,196
Oh, my God, what a beautiful face.

1207
01:27:43,281 --> 01:27:47,242
This would be a perfect moment,
except you landed on my testicles.

1208
01:27:47,326 --> 01:27:48,952
Please, get off.

1209
01:27:49,871 --> 01:27:52,330
God, my balls.

1210
01:27:53,541 --> 01:27:54,791
Sam!

1211
01:27:55,877 --> 01:27:59,004
- Where are we? Simmons!
- Hey! Yeah!

1212
01:27:59,297 --> 01:28:04,050
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What is this? It's Vegas.

1213
01:28:04,135 --> 01:28:05,969
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

1214
01:28:06,053 --> 01:28:08,555
Hey, I think we're in Vegas!

1215
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:12,225
That really, really hurt.
You're just lucky that I didn't get hurt!

1216
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:14,978
People could have gotten killed, okay?
And if I would have gotten hurt,

1217
01:28:15,062 --> 01:28:17,022
- you would have heard...
- Shut up.

1218
01:28:17,106 --> 01:28:21,401
I told you I was opening a space bridge.
It's the fastest way to travel to Egypt.

1219
01:28:21,485 --> 01:28:24,321
When did you... When did you tell us?
You didn't tell us anything.

1220
01:28:24,405 --> 01:28:26,156
You didn't tell us anything.
Why are we in Egypt?

1221
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:30,826
Don't you get snippy with me, fleshling!
You were duly informed!

1222
01:28:30,911 --> 01:28:32,578
Can you just stop for a second?
Can you focus?

1223
01:28:32,662 --> 01:28:33,829
Can you tell us why we're in Egypt

1224
01:28:33,914 --> 01:28:36,582
so we can all have a little bit of
semblance of peace of mind?

1225
01:28:36,666 --> 01:28:40,085
This planet was visited
by our race once before,

1226
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:42,922
by our earliest ancestors, millennia ago.

1227
01:28:43,006 --> 01:28:45,925
They were on an exploratory mission
to harvest Energon,

1228
01:28:46,009 --> 01:28:48,594
the lifeblood of our race.

1229
01:28:48,678 --> 01:28:53,515
Without it, we'll all perish, oxidize
and rust, like my wretched self!

1230
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:57,519
Do you have any idea what it's like
to slowly fall apart and die?

1231
01:28:57,604 --> 01:29:00,522
Let's not get episodic, okay, old-timer?

1232
01:29:01,316 --> 01:29:06,528
Beginning, middle, end.
Facts. Details. Condense. Plot. Tell it.

1233
01:29:06,613 --> 01:29:11,450
Somewhere buried in this desert,
our ancestors built a great machine.

1234
01:29:11,534 --> 01:29:15,746
It harvests Energon by destroying suns.

1235
01:29:15,830 --> 01:29:17,539
- Destroy suns?
- You mean blow them up?

1236
01:29:17,624 --> 01:29:19,500
Yes. You see, in the beginning,

1237
01:29:19,584 --> 01:29:22,711
there were seven Primes,
our original leaders.

1238
01:29:22,796 --> 01:29:26,882
And they set out into the universe,
seeking distant suns to harvest.

1239
01:29:27,550 --> 01:29:32,972
The Primes set out with one rule,
never destroy a planet with life,

1240
01:29:33,056 --> 01:29:35,975
until one of them tried to defy this rule.

1241
01:29:36,059 --> 01:29:40,312
And his name forevermore
was The Fallen.

1242
01:29:42,065 --> 01:29:44,441
He despised the human race

1243
01:29:45,652 --> 01:29:49,822
and he wanted to kill you all
by turning on that machine.

1244
01:29:49,906 --> 01:29:53,951
The only way to activate it
is with a legendary key

1245
01:29:54,035 --> 01:29:57,120
called the Matrix of Leadership.

1246
01:30:03,419 --> 01:30:07,797
A great battle took place over
possession of the Matrix.

1247
01:30:12,177 --> 01:30:15,096
The Fallen was stronger than
his brothers,

1248
01:30:16,473 --> 01:30:20,935
so they had no choice
but to steal and hide it from him.

1249
01:30:21,562 --> 01:30:26,399
In the ultimate sacrifice, they gave
their lives to seal the Matrix away

1250
01:30:26,483 --> 01:30:29,652
in a tomb made of
their very own bodies,

1251
01:30:30,404 --> 01:30:33,281
a tomb we cannot find.

1252
01:30:34,742 --> 01:30:40,413
Somewhere, buried in this desert,
that deadly machine remains.

1253
01:30:40,497 --> 01:30:42,540
The Fallen knows where it is

1254
01:30:42,624 --> 01:30:48,254
and if he finds the tomb of the Primes,
your world will be no more.

1255
01:30:48,630 --> 01:30:50,256
Okay, so how do we stop him?

1256
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:52,717
Only a Prime can defeat The Fallen.

1257
01:30:52,801 --> 01:30:54,385
Optimus Prime?

1258
01:30:56,805 --> 01:30:58,931
So, you've met a Prime?

1259
01:30:59,016 --> 01:31:02,101
Why, you must have met
a great descendant.

1260
01:31:02,186 --> 01:31:05,313
Is he alive, here on this planet?

1261
01:31:06,023 --> 01:31:08,316
He sacrificed himself to save me.

1262
01:31:08,776 --> 01:31:10,234
So, he's dead.

1263
01:31:10,319 --> 01:31:14,405
Without a Prime, it's impossible.
No one else could stop The Fallen.

1264
01:31:14,490 --> 01:31:18,493
So, the same energy that's gonna be
used to reactivate the machine,

1265
01:31:18,577 --> 01:31:21,203
could that energy somehow be used
to reactivate Optimus

1266
01:31:21,287 --> 01:31:22,329
and bring him back to life?

1267
01:31:22,413 --> 01:31:27,125
It was never designed for that purpose,
but it's an energy like no other.

1268
01:31:27,418 --> 01:31:31,088
So, then how do you get us to the Matrix
before the Decepticons get to me?

1269
01:31:31,172 --> 01:31:34,382
Follow your mind, your map,
your symbols.

1270
01:31:34,467 --> 01:31:37,094
What you carved in the sand,
it's your clue.

1271
01:31:37,178 --> 01:31:42,390
When dawn alights the Dagger's Tip,
Three Kings will reveal the doorway!

1272
01:31:42,475 --> 01:31:44,434
Find the doorway!

1273
01:31:44,519 --> 01:31:46,394
Go now! Go!

1274
01:31:46,479 --> 01:31:49,397
That was my mission.
It's your mission now.

1275
01:31:49,482 --> 01:31:53,777
Go before the Decepticons find me
and find you.

1276
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:01,618
Okay, here's what my CIA contact says.

1277
01:32:01,702 --> 01:32:05,247
Ancient Sumerians used to call
the Gulf of Aqaba the "Dagger's Tip."

1278
01:32:05,331 --> 01:32:07,207
- That's the Dagger's Tip.
- It's part of the Red Sea.

1279
01:32:07,291 --> 01:32:09,459
It divides Egypt and Jordan
like the tip of a blade.

1280
01:32:09,544 --> 01:32:13,380
29.5 degrees north, 35 east. Here it is.

1281
01:32:13,881 --> 01:32:15,841
First thing we've got to do
is get Optimus to the Dagger's Tip.

1282
01:32:15,925 --> 01:32:18,385
How are you gonna get him
halfway around the world?

1283
01:32:18,469 --> 01:32:19,636
I'm gonna make a call.

1284
01:32:22,557 --> 01:32:23,849
We got cops!

1285
01:32:30,189 --> 01:32:31,231
I can't go to prison, guys.

1286
01:32:35,153 --> 01:32:37,737
Sam, we got to get off this road
and lay low.

1287
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:50,166
Man, stupid cops!

1288
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:52,459
This is what's called
blending in like a ninja.

1289
01:32:52,544 --> 01:32:56,338
- Shut up or I'll blend my fist in your face.
- They're gone.

1290
01:32:56,423 --> 01:32:59,049
Okay, we're running out of time.
I gotta make the call to Lennox...

1291
01:32:59,134 --> 01:33:00,467
You're on the Worldwide Wanted List.

1292
01:33:00,552 --> 01:33:03,179
Try calling one base,
they'll track you here in seconds.

1293
01:33:03,263 --> 01:33:05,890
- CIA is all over this place!
- You're gonna call.

1294
01:33:11,438 --> 01:33:14,023
- Okay. That's a good idea.
- All right.

1295
01:33:14,107 --> 01:33:16,525
I mean, I just had my mind
on other things,

1296
01:33:16,610 --> 01:33:18,068
like winding up in an Egyptian prison.

1297
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:23,115
NEST departure, 2100 hours.

1298
01:33:24,451 --> 01:33:28,245
So, we're shipping him back to base.
This is such a mistake.

1299
01:33:33,627 --> 01:33:35,836
Major Lennox, phone call.

1300
01:33:36,630 --> 01:33:39,715
Lennox, I'm with the kid. The kid. You
know, the one with the attitude, right?

1301
01:33:39,799 --> 01:33:41,383
We need the truck. The truck.

1302
01:33:41,468 --> 01:33:44,220
We got a possible resurrection
going on over here.

1303
01:33:44,304 --> 01:33:48,557
You're not gonna believe where we are.
Code Tut, as in King Tutankhamen.

1304
01:33:48,642 --> 01:33:50,184
Back of a $1 bill.

1305
01:33:50,644 --> 01:33:56,941
Coordinates for airdrop, 29.5 north,
34.88 east. Write it down. Write it.

1306
01:33:57,025 --> 01:33:59,735
Oh, my God. I got to go. Okay.
Heat comes.

1307
01:33:59,819 --> 01:34:01,362
Wait, who are you?

1308
01:34:02,614 --> 01:34:05,074
Wait. It's me. Leo. Me. Leo. Leo. Leo.

1309
01:34:05,158 --> 01:34:06,242
Cops are coming right now.
We need to go!

1310
01:34:06,326 --> 01:34:08,118
Move, move, move, move.

1311
01:34:09,246 --> 01:34:12,997
Coordinates, 29.5 north, 34.88 east.

1312
01:34:13,082 --> 01:34:15,541
Tip of the Red Sea. Gulf of Aqaba.

1313
01:34:15,626 --> 01:34:18,169
Egypt? Are you serious?

1314
01:34:19,797 --> 01:34:20,880
Sir.

1315
01:34:25,177 --> 01:34:28,012
Even if we could figure out a way
to get big man over there,

1316
01:34:28,097 --> 01:34:30,765
how is this little kid supposed
to bring him back to life?

1317
01:34:30,849 --> 01:34:34,185
Look, I don't know,
but we got to trust him.

1318
01:34:36,522 --> 01:34:37,855
Okay, let's go over it again.

1319
01:34:37,940 --> 01:34:40,108
When the dawn alights
the Dagger's Tip,

1320
01:34:40,192 --> 01:34:42,485
- the Three Kings...
- Will reveal the doorway.

1321
01:34:42,569 --> 01:34:44,362
That's what he said.
You know what it means?

1322
01:34:44,446 --> 01:34:45,989
- No, what does it mean?
- I have no idea.

1323
01:34:46,073 --> 01:34:47,865
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Checkpoint. Checkpoint.

1324
01:34:47,950 --> 01:34:49,367
I don't have my passport.

1325
01:34:51,745 --> 01:34:53,121
Passport!

1326
01:35:00,045 --> 01:35:02,046
They got cameras at the top.

1327
01:35:06,010 --> 01:35:09,470
All right, chill. This is espionage time.
I can handle it.

1328
01:35:09,555 --> 01:35:12,598
These are my people.
I'm one-thirty-sixth Arab.

1329
01:35:15,519 --> 01:35:17,020
Great, a fricking Munchkin.

1330
01:35:17,104 --> 01:35:19,564
Little people are mean.
Tell him he's tall.

1331
01:35:28,407 --> 01:35:31,242
The Dagger's Tip? Right?

1332
01:35:31,327 --> 01:35:33,828
Egypt, Jordan. We want to go there.

1333
01:35:33,912 --> 01:35:37,164
Me and my family. This is my family.
This is my son,

1334
01:35:37,248 --> 01:35:40,876
my other son, my daughter.
We're tourists, from New York.

1335
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,836
- New York?
- Yes. Yes.

1336
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:43,962
Fifty kilometers.

1337
01:35:44,047 --> 01:35:46,381
You look like the guy that runs
my falafel stand. Thank you very much.

1338
01:35:46,841 --> 01:35:48,633
- I know. I know you from somewhere.
- Go, Yankees!

1339
01:35:49,302 --> 01:35:50,469
Put it on the wire to the CIA.

1340
01:35:54,849 --> 01:35:59,603
Decepticons, boy's location detected.

1341
01:36:08,613 --> 01:36:11,531
Undercover, yo. You got to blend in
with your surroundings.

1342
01:36:11,616 --> 01:36:13,950
You know, you got to be part
of the landscape.

1343
01:36:22,043 --> 01:36:25,128
Awesome! I think aliens built that.

1344
01:36:25,505 --> 01:36:26,505
Yeah, yeah.

1345
01:36:27,256 --> 01:36:29,299
Come on. Move it! Move it!

1346
01:36:29,425 --> 01:36:31,510
Guard us. Low profile.
Don't make a scene, okay?

1347
01:36:31,594 --> 01:36:34,679
Yeah, some of us got work to do!
Dumb Autobots.

1348
01:36:56,285 --> 01:36:59,371
Being my girlfriend is hazardous
to your health.

1349
01:37:00,164 --> 01:37:04,333
Yeah, well, girls like dangerous boys.

1350
01:37:04,751 --> 01:37:06,335
- Do they?
- Yeah.

1351
01:37:09,172 --> 01:37:11,340
You might as well just say it.

1352
01:37:11,425 --> 01:37:12,883
Ladies first.

1353
01:37:14,344 --> 01:37:17,054
Okay, so tonight you're going to be
a gentleman.

1354
01:37:17,139 --> 01:37:20,266
- You're really chivalrous.
- Why are you mad at me?

1355
01:37:20,350 --> 01:37:23,853
You know what?
Baby, I'm not... I'm not mad.

1356
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:29,442
Do you realize that I just flew 3,000
miles to keep you from getting killed?

1357
01:37:29,526 --> 01:37:30,734
I know.

1358
01:37:34,114 --> 01:37:36,740
Who else could be your girlfriend, Sam?

1359
01:37:36,825 --> 01:37:39,535
Look at the things I go through with you.

1360
01:37:40,162 --> 01:37:42,329
And now we're underneath the moon
and the stars

1361
01:37:42,414 --> 01:37:44,623
and the three most beautiful pyramids
on the planet

1362
01:37:44,708 --> 01:37:47,042
and you still can't even tell me that
you love me.

1363
01:37:48,128 --> 01:37:49,503
Pyramids.

1364
01:37:50,714 --> 01:37:52,131
What? Why do boys always

1365
01:37:52,215 --> 01:37:54,175
- change the subject?
- Pyramids and stars.

1366
01:37:54,259 --> 01:37:55,718
- Sam?
- Come with me really quick.

1367
01:38:03,894 --> 01:38:05,978
Simmons! Leo! Wake up!

1368
01:38:09,274 --> 01:38:11,567
Listen, astronomy class, page 47.
Remember the class?

1369
01:38:11,651 --> 01:38:14,320
No. I was only in college for two days.
Remember that?

1370
01:38:14,404 --> 01:38:16,572
- Here. Get up. Up, up.
- What is he talking about?

1371
01:38:21,828 --> 01:38:22,995
Okay, you see those three stars?

1372
01:38:23,079 --> 01:38:24,830
You see
how the last one touches the horizon?

1373
01:38:24,956 --> 01:38:27,665
That's Orion's belt,
but it's also called the Three Kings.

1374
01:38:27,750 --> 01:38:29,542
And the reason for that
is the three Egyptian kings

1375
01:38:29,627 --> 01:38:32,420
who built the pyramids of Giza
built them to mirror those stars,

1376
01:38:32,505 --> 01:38:34,339
so it's like an arrow staring us
straight in the face.

1377
01:38:34,423 --> 01:38:37,884
They all point due east, towards Jordan.
The mountains of Petra.

1378
01:38:50,898 --> 01:38:52,190
We've had an engine malfunction.

1379
01:38:52,274 --> 01:38:54,234
We're gonna have to divert
to SOCCENT.

1380
01:38:54,318 --> 01:38:56,402
Flight master, let's lighten the load
and prepare for bailout.

1381
01:38:56,487 --> 01:38:58,947
Bailout? Bailout? Bailout? Bailout?

1382
01:38:59,031 --> 01:39:01,950
- All right, team, grab your chutes!
- Bailout like bailout?

1383
01:39:04,537 --> 01:39:06,996
- You familiar with the standard MC-4?
- Of course not!

1384
01:39:07,081 --> 01:39:09,374
I've never jumped out of
a perfectly good airplane before!

1385
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:10,833
Wait a minute, is this really happening?

1386
01:39:10,918 --> 01:39:12,710
- Yeah.
- All right, here we go.

1387
01:39:13,671 --> 01:39:17,382
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You're behind this, aren't you?

1388
01:39:17,466 --> 01:39:19,092
What are you talking about?
You heard the pilot.

1389
01:39:19,176 --> 01:39:23,054
These guys don't mess around.
This is just standard procedure.

1390
01:39:23,138 --> 01:39:26,307
I'm just following orders to the letter.
Isn't that what you said?

1391
01:39:26,934 --> 01:39:30,019
You just signed a death warrant
on your career, Major.

1392
01:39:34,149 --> 01:39:36,234
What was that? What was that?

1393
01:39:36,318 --> 01:39:38,653
That's not good. Come on.

1394
01:39:39,655 --> 01:39:41,155
- Right this way!
- I can't jump out of an airplane!

1395
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:43,283
- I have an ulcer! No, no.
- Come on. It's okay.

1396
01:39:43,659 --> 01:39:45,910
I really can't do this.
What are you doing...

1397
01:39:46,453 --> 01:39:48,496
Come here! Come here.

1398
01:39:48,581 --> 01:39:52,833
- Why aren't you wearing your chute?
- Because I have to secure the VIPs first.

1399
01:39:52,917 --> 01:39:57,129
Okay, I want you to listen very carefully
and memorize everything that I say.

1400
01:39:57,213 --> 01:40:00,173
Each chute has a GPS tracker so you
can be found by Search and Rescue.

1401
01:40:00,258 --> 01:40:02,384
Right next to that's a fabric webbing
called a bridle,

1402
01:40:02,468 --> 01:40:04,595
which holds the pin
that keeps the main container closed.

1403
01:40:04,679 --> 01:40:06,763
- Okay, are you listening?
- I can't hear what...

1404
01:40:06,848 --> 01:40:08,265
- Stop that!
- All right. All right.

1405
01:40:08,349 --> 01:40:10,809
All right,
when the pilot chute inflates into the air,

1406
01:40:10,893 --> 01:40:13,061
it pulls the pin and opens the main.

1407
01:40:13,146 --> 01:40:15,188
Red's your backup, blue's your primary.

1408
01:40:15,273 --> 01:40:19,443
I want you to pull the blue.
I need you to pull it really hard!

1409
01:40:19,527 --> 01:40:22,362
Not now, we're on the plane,
you dumb-ass!

1410
01:40:25,241 --> 01:40:28,243
- He say good-bye?
- No, he didn't even say good-bye.

1411
01:40:28,703 --> 01:40:30,495
General, we're loaded and ready.

1412
01:40:30,580 --> 01:40:33,457
You give us the go, and we'll be ready
to press in five minutes.

1413
01:40:33,541 --> 01:40:36,084
- Excellent.
- Sir, you need to see this now.

1414
01:40:39,047 --> 01:40:41,089
- Have we checked these coordinates?
- Egypt, sir.

1415
01:40:41,174 --> 01:40:43,967
- They're airdropping in.
- You've got to be kidding me.

1416
01:40:44,052 --> 01:40:45,427
He knows something.

1417
01:40:45,511 --> 01:40:47,888
We need to be ready to back him up
if this thing goes hot.

1418
01:40:49,182 --> 01:40:50,307
Copy that.

1419
01:40:50,391 --> 01:40:52,851
CIA just got a hit on the boy,

1420
01:40:53,394 --> 01:40:55,479
100 miles from the location
on that little note there.

1421
01:40:55,563 --> 01:40:56,647
It's getting hotter.

1422
01:41:01,110 --> 01:41:03,737
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

1423
01:41:24,966 --> 01:41:26,967
You see the size of this?

1424
01:41:27,678 --> 01:41:30,096
- You see this?
- Spectacular.

1425
01:41:31,765 --> 01:41:34,225
Amazing. Look at that.

1426
01:41:44,444 --> 01:41:46,779
- It's here somewhere, guys.
- Yeah, why?

1427
01:41:46,863 --> 01:41:48,406
'Cause we're trusting Grandpa Blackbird

1428
01:41:48,490 --> 01:41:49,990
who doesn't even know
what planet he's on?

1429
01:41:50,075 --> 01:41:54,078
In his defense, this is the biggest
doorway I've ever seen in my entire life.

1430
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:58,374
Okay. Well, that's great.
Let me do a quick search, all right?

1431
01:41:58,458 --> 01:42:00,042
Nope. Ever cross your mind, guys,

1432
01:42:00,127 --> 01:42:01,544
that archeologists
have been here before?

1433
01:42:01,628 --> 01:42:02,712
There's nothing here.

1434
01:42:02,796 --> 01:42:05,172
Real life is heartbreak, despair, kid.

1435
01:42:05,257 --> 01:42:07,383
Sometimes you get to
the end of the rainbow

1436
01:42:07,467 --> 01:42:09,635
and the leprechauns went
and booby-trapped it!

1437
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:12,096
I'm listening to you?
You live with your mother!

1438
01:42:13,265 --> 01:42:15,391
- It's not over.
- It is over. It's done.

1439
01:42:15,475 --> 01:42:16,976
Why are we still listening to you,
little punk-ass?

1440
01:42:17,060 --> 01:42:19,103
I mean, what you ever done for us
except ding my rim?

1441
01:42:19,187 --> 01:42:21,147
Killed Megatron. How about that?

1442
01:42:21,231 --> 01:42:22,273
Well, he didn't get the job done,

1443
01:42:22,357 --> 01:42:23,899
you know what I mean,
'cause he's back now...

1444
01:42:23,984 --> 01:42:26,902
- Are you scared?
- Scared? Scared of your ugly face!

1445
01:42:26,987 --> 01:42:29,405
I'm ugly?
Well, we're twins, you stupid genius!

1446
01:42:29,489 --> 01:42:31,240
Bring it, then! Get off me!

1447
01:42:31,324 --> 01:42:34,410
- I'll change your face around!
- I'll get all up in that ass!

1448
01:42:34,494 --> 01:42:35,911
Bring it!

1449
01:42:36,663 --> 01:42:37,830
Guys!

1450
01:42:39,166 --> 01:42:40,750
- You like the way that feels?
- That didn't hurt.

1451
01:42:40,834 --> 01:42:42,376
You like that, don't you?

1452
01:42:42,461 --> 01:42:44,836
- Come on, Bumblebee!
- Bumblebee, listen.

1453
01:42:51,510 --> 01:42:52,510
Now, that's rude.

1454
01:43:04,482 --> 01:43:06,441
Oh, my God. The symbols.

1455
01:43:07,693 --> 01:43:09,527
Bee! Shoot it.

1456
01:43:35,387 --> 01:43:38,056
- Check this out.
- Look at it.

1457
01:43:39,308 --> 01:43:40,308
Wow!

1458
01:43:40,392 --> 01:43:42,894
These are the bodies
Jetfire was talking about.

1459
01:43:43,437 --> 01:43:45,355
The tomb of the Primes.

1460
01:43:45,815 --> 01:43:47,065
Yo!

1461
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:49,567
Yo!

1462
01:44:03,582 --> 01:44:04,916
The Matrix.

1463
01:44:22,475 --> 01:44:23,684
No.

1464
01:44:24,936 --> 01:44:26,061
No.

1465
01:44:28,439 --> 01:44:30,983
Thousands of years, turned to dust.

1466
01:44:31,609 --> 01:44:33,569
This isn't how it's supposed to end.

1467
01:44:33,653 --> 01:44:34,820
Hear that?

1468
01:44:39,367 --> 01:44:41,743
US Air Force! C-17s!

1469
01:44:41,828 --> 01:44:44,538
- What's a C-17?
- You can't bring him back, Sam.

1470
01:44:44,622 --> 01:44:48,208
- There's nothing left.
- Look! Look around you.

1471
01:44:48,293 --> 01:44:50,878
We didn't just go through everything
we went through for no reason at all,

1472
01:44:50,962 --> 01:44:52,379
to just have it end like this.

1473
01:44:52,463 --> 01:44:54,131
There is a reason that we are here.

1474
01:44:54,215 --> 01:44:58,093
The voices and the symbols in my head
led us here for a purpose.

1475
01:45:03,975 --> 01:45:06,268
Everyone's after me
because of what I know,

1476
01:45:08,563 --> 01:45:11,773
and what I know is that
this is going to work.

1477
01:45:12,233 --> 01:45:15,277
- How do you know it's gonna work?
- Because I believe it.

1478
01:45:25,330 --> 01:45:27,664
You best let me out of this plane.

1479
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:41,302
Dropping the big boy. Sam!

1480
01:45:48,435 --> 01:45:50,686
You think you can bring him back to life
with that pixie dust?

1481
01:45:50,771 --> 01:45:52,355
Absolutely. Let's go.

1482
01:46:02,449 --> 01:46:03,658
Go!

1483
01:46:04,493 --> 01:46:07,203
Let's move it.
Remember, they're friendlies.

1484
01:46:17,839 --> 01:46:19,382
Cover Optimus!

1485
01:46:22,344 --> 01:46:24,428
Secure the village.
Get those cases down here.

1486
01:46:24,513 --> 01:46:26,639
I need snipers and Stingers up high.

1487
01:46:26,723 --> 01:46:30,851
So, we just dropped off 10 tons of
dead robot in the middle of nowhere.

1488
01:46:30,936 --> 01:46:32,561
I hope this little kid know
what he's doing.

1489
01:46:32,646 --> 01:46:33,688
Yeah, me too.

1490
01:46:39,653 --> 01:46:42,863
Got a visual! Yellow team! Four clicks!

1491
01:46:46,159 --> 01:46:47,493
Pop flare!

1492
01:46:49,746 --> 01:46:52,373
- That's them, right there. See the flare?
- Right over there! See it?

1493
01:47:03,426 --> 01:47:04,592
Sam!

1494
01:47:16,939 --> 01:47:18,481
Oh, God. Please, God! Please.

1495
01:47:18,566 --> 01:47:20,191
Leo, stop freaking out. Stop freaking out.

1496
01:47:20,276 --> 01:47:21,693
Shut this guy up, huh?

1497
01:47:21,777 --> 01:47:24,195
- Please, just let me live, just let me live!
- Shut up and let him drive!

1498
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:25,572
- Just stop screaming...
- All right, that's it!

1499
01:47:28,284 --> 01:47:29,743
I can't take that guy anymore.

1500
01:47:43,007 --> 01:47:45,091
Hide in the dust! Use the dust!

1501
01:47:52,683 --> 01:47:54,642
We've got to split up.
Bumblebee, you're the decoy.

1502
01:47:54,727 --> 01:47:57,395
You lead the Decepticons away,
all right? I'm gonna get Optimus.

1503
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:00,023
I'll help draw their fire
with Huey and Dewey there.

1504
01:48:00,107 --> 01:48:02,150
You get to those soldiers.

1505
01:48:03,277 --> 01:48:06,321
- I hope that dust works, kid.
- Thank you.

1506
01:48:10,117 --> 01:48:13,578
He's turning around. He's coming back.
He's coming back.

1507
01:48:14,330 --> 01:48:15,371
It's up to me.

1508
01:48:15,664 --> 01:48:18,333
One man, alone,
betrayed by the country he loves,

1509
01:48:18,417 --> 01:48:20,919
now its last hope
in their final hour of need.

1510
01:48:21,003 --> 01:48:24,671
Prepare to be driven like never before,
by the maestro.

1511
01:48:24,756 --> 01:48:27,758
- Hey, hey! Don't go nowhere! Drive.
- You'll never make it, kid.

1512
01:48:27,842 --> 01:48:30,302
- I'm coming with you.
- Bravery will only get you so far.

1513
01:48:30,386 --> 01:48:33,305
You tased me, okay? You owe me!
I'm going.

1514
01:48:33,389 --> 01:48:35,182
Okay, okay. That was a test.
You passed. All right?

1515
01:48:43,483 --> 01:48:46,902
That thing's got alien tattoos all over it.
That ain't Air Force.

1516
01:48:50,990 --> 01:48:53,158
- What the hell was that?
- Anyone copy?

1517
01:48:53,243 --> 01:48:55,285
- Anyone there? Who's up?
- Copy?

1518
01:48:55,370 --> 01:48:57,663
- Radio's down.
- It's dead. Comms are down.

1519
01:48:57,747 --> 01:48:59,081
EMP burst.

1520
01:48:59,457 --> 01:49:02,334
I see how this day is going
in this godforsaken desert.

1521
01:49:04,087 --> 01:49:05,129
Yes, sir?

1522
01:49:05,213 --> 01:49:08,048
- Major Lennox told me to pull the cord.
- I know, sir.

1523
01:49:08,133 --> 01:49:10,968
Well, what country am I in right now?

1524
01:49:11,052 --> 01:49:12,302
United States.

1525
01:49:12,387 --> 01:49:16,306
No, not the United States.
I'm from the United States.

1526
01:49:16,391 --> 01:49:19,059
I'm in the middle of nowhere
surrounded by donkeys.

1527
01:49:19,144 --> 01:49:23,981
Well, that was our good friend,
Galloway. He's less than pleased.

1528
01:49:24,065 --> 01:49:26,733
How is it that we can't reach our men,

1529
01:49:26,818 --> 01:49:32,197
but he can reach me
from some random Egyptian desert?

1530
01:49:36,202 --> 01:49:37,452
Nothing.

1531
01:49:38,037 --> 01:49:40,914
Right, go burn an SOS. Let the eye in
the sky know we need some help.

1532
01:49:40,999 --> 01:49:43,000
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, boys, old school time!

1533
01:49:43,543 --> 01:49:45,919
Pop some more flares
so the kid can find us.

1534
01:49:51,508 --> 01:49:54,969
Look. There it is.
We got a couple of miles.

1535
01:49:55,637 --> 01:50:00,474
Lennox's team has the latest
in quantum crypto gear.

1536
01:50:00,559 --> 01:50:05,938
Can somebody tell me why we can't
establish simple radio contact?

1537
01:50:06,023 --> 01:50:08,691
We're hailing them on every frequency
and mode in the book, sir.

1538
01:50:08,775 --> 01:50:11,152
Our satellites in the area have
gone blind. We're working it, sir.

1539
01:50:11,236 --> 01:50:14,864
Damn it. Something's not right.
It doesn't add up.

1540
01:50:14,948 --> 01:50:18,367
Contact the Jordanians, see
what air assets they've got in the area,

1541
01:50:18,452 --> 01:50:20,828
and get Egypt's General Salam.

1542
01:50:20,913 --> 01:50:24,790
Ask him to clear some USV overflights
in Egyptian airspace.

1543
01:50:24,875 --> 01:50:27,960
We need an assist
in confirming visuals now.

1544
01:50:28,212 --> 01:50:29,795
Scramble Predators now.

1545
01:50:29,963 --> 01:50:31,380
V-1, rotate.

1546
01:50:43,435 --> 01:50:45,269
We still have a mile that way.

1547
01:50:50,943 --> 01:50:52,318
Come on.

1548
01:50:55,405 --> 01:50:56,989
This way. This way.

1549
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:04,956
- One man, alone...
- Stop saying that!

1550
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:06,290
...betrayed by the country he loves!

1551
01:51:06,375 --> 01:51:08,584
Oh, my goodness.
I'm in the car, okay? You're not alone.

1552
01:51:09,253 --> 01:51:11,754
Just relax. You're with the maestro.

1553
01:51:20,429 --> 01:51:22,472
I don't think he's still following us.

1554
01:51:23,474 --> 01:51:25,141
That's what you think.

1555
01:51:41,993 --> 01:51:45,745
Master, sorry to be the bearer
of bad news,

1556
01:51:45,830 --> 01:51:48,873
but the soldiers brought
the body of Prime.

1557
01:51:48,958 --> 01:51:51,167
The boy must have the Matrix.

1558
01:51:51,585 --> 01:51:54,212
We cannot let him reach Optimus.

1559
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:58,550
Decepticons, begin our assault!

1560
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:00,885
We've got incoming!

1561
01:52:17,028 --> 01:52:19,946
We got a whole lot of fight
coming our way.

1562
01:52:20,031 --> 01:52:22,032
- How many?
- About 13 of them.

1563
01:52:22,116 --> 01:52:24,784
This ain't good. This ain't good.

1564
01:52:33,002 --> 01:52:35,211
We're about to get our asses whupped.

1565
01:52:36,339 --> 01:52:38,131
Bravo-Charlie, kneel!

1566
01:52:38,215 --> 01:52:41,091
All right, those Decepticons
are searching for Sam.

1567
01:52:42,469 --> 01:52:45,387
Whatever he has, he thinks
it'll bring Optimus back to life,

1568
01:52:45,472 --> 01:52:48,349
so our mission is to find him
and get him to Optimus.

1569
01:52:48,433 --> 01:52:51,226
All right, we're gonna draw fire
from the left flank. I need a scout team.

1570
01:52:51,311 --> 01:52:52,353
I'm leading.

1571
01:52:52,437 --> 01:52:54,855
Go up through the middle
with Arcee and Ironhide!

1572
01:52:54,939 --> 01:52:56,482
All right, when you see
the precious cargo,

1573
01:52:56,566 --> 01:52:59,318
I want you to pop green smoke and
come back through those pillars.

1574
01:52:59,402 --> 01:53:02,613
We'll have the ambush set. All right.
Let's go. Move out!

1575
01:53:14,709 --> 01:53:17,002
You ever see that film
Gunfight at the O.K. Corral?

1576
01:53:18,463 --> 01:53:21,673
- With Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas?
- No, why?

1577
01:53:24,928 --> 01:53:27,763
- Looks like we're right in the middle of it.
- Is that good?

1578
01:53:29,974 --> 01:53:31,517
A lot of people died.

1579
01:53:50,495 --> 01:53:51,662
Hide!

1580
01:53:53,081 --> 01:53:55,165
- Vámonos, amigos!
- Oh, my God!

1581
01:53:59,587 --> 01:54:01,088
- Hit the deck!
- Oh, my God!

1582
01:54:17,104 --> 01:54:18,187
Sam, Sam.

1583
01:54:19,273 --> 01:54:21,315
I don't think they saw us.

1584
01:54:21,859 --> 01:54:23,693
Get down. Get down. Get down.

1585
01:54:24,069 --> 01:54:25,653
Okay. Listen.

1586
01:54:27,531 --> 01:54:30,867
Once it's clear, we run for Optimus
as fast as we can, okay?

1587
01:54:32,202 --> 01:54:33,703
What if it doesn't work?

1588
01:54:34,538 --> 01:54:36,122
It's gonna work.

1589
01:54:36,206 --> 01:54:39,208
- What if it doesn't?
- It's gonna work. It'll work.

1590
01:56:15,638 --> 01:56:17,097
Up, up, up!

1591
01:56:27,066 --> 01:56:28,733
Get ready to jump!

1592
01:56:47,587 --> 01:56:50,255
We got a half-mile. I don't think
the soldiers know we're here.

1593
01:56:52,967 --> 01:56:54,301
Fall back!

1594
01:56:54,385 --> 01:56:57,845
- Ironhide, up the middle!
- Ironhide, move it!

1595
01:56:57,929 --> 01:56:59,930
Let's go! Go, go!

1596
01:57:07,105 --> 01:57:08,480
Devastator!

1597
01:57:11,943 --> 01:57:13,861
We're trapped! There's nowhere to go.
We're gonna die.

1598
01:57:14,029 --> 01:57:16,655
If we're going out, we're going out
like men, understand?

1599
01:57:48,813 --> 01:57:50,648
Look at this mother...

1600
01:57:50,732 --> 01:57:52,399
Mean robots suck!

1601
01:58:04,371 --> 01:58:06,955
Hang on! Hang on, okay?

1602
01:58:11,586 --> 01:58:13,379
- Simmons!
- Don't let go!

1603
01:58:13,463 --> 01:58:15,923
Hang in there, I got you! Just hang in.

1604
01:58:20,053 --> 01:58:21,553
I don't want to die!

1605
01:58:23,222 --> 01:58:25,098
Kung fu grip, boy. Kung fu grip!

1606
01:58:25,182 --> 01:58:26,432
You ain't getting me!

1607
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:33,773
He dead. He got so ate.

1608
01:58:34,108 --> 01:58:37,026
- Who's your daddy now, huh?
- He got all ate up.

1609
01:58:37,111 --> 01:58:39,237
The only safe place is right under it.

1610
01:58:39,321 --> 01:58:42,990
- Run at it. Run for its feet! Move it!
- Yeah.

1611
01:58:49,873 --> 01:58:53,209
You should've never eaten me!
I'm gonna bust your face up!

1612
01:58:58,215 --> 01:58:59,382
Oh, my God!

1613
01:59:02,136 --> 01:59:04,637
Nobody mess with me! In your face!

1614
01:59:05,556 --> 01:59:07,223
Keep fighting, Mudflap!

1615
01:59:07,307 --> 01:59:08,391
Oh, my God!

1616
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:18,109
Nobody messes with the twins.

1617
01:59:21,989 --> 01:59:24,157
I got you... My bad!

1618
01:59:26,910 --> 01:59:28,995
Man! You shot me in the face!

1619
01:59:29,413 --> 01:59:31,706
- Stay under it!
- Yeah, stay under it!

1620
01:59:35,669 --> 01:59:37,003
Come on.

1621
01:59:53,186 --> 01:59:54,394
Judy!

1622
01:59:59,484 --> 02:00:01,568
- Sam! Sam!
- What?

1623
02:00:02,570 --> 02:00:04,529
Sam! Sam!

1624
02:00:08,993 --> 02:00:10,243
Sam!

1625
02:00:10,328 --> 02:00:11,661
- Sam!
- Dad!

1626
02:00:19,378 --> 02:00:20,796
Wait, wait!

1627
02:00:22,048 --> 02:00:25,550
Please listen to me!
I want you to run! Run!

1628
02:00:25,635 --> 02:00:28,345
Dad, just stop!
They don't want you, they want me!

1629
02:00:28,429 --> 02:00:29,888
- Oh, God!
- Wait!

1630
02:00:29,972 --> 02:00:31,848
Sam Witwicky.

1631
02:00:31,933 --> 02:00:36,228
Don't hurt them. This is what you want.
You don't want them.

1632
02:00:36,312 --> 02:00:37,979
- Go! Go!
- Please, stop!

1633
02:00:38,064 --> 02:00:39,231
- Stop!
- Listen to your father!

1634
02:00:39,315 --> 02:00:41,107
Just get out of here!

1635
02:00:41,442 --> 02:00:43,819
Just don't hurt them.
I know what you want.

1636
02:00:43,903 --> 02:00:45,403
Just go! Just go!

1637
02:00:45,488 --> 02:00:49,282
And I know that you need me
because I know about the Matrix.

1638
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:51,451
- Don't do it, Sam...
- Please, Dad.

1639
02:00:51,536 --> 02:00:55,497
- They're going to kill us all anyway!
- Here's what you want, right here.

1640
02:00:55,873 --> 02:00:57,290
Bumblebee!

1641
02:01:10,513 --> 02:01:12,138
Kill him, Bee. Kill him.

1642
02:01:50,093 --> 02:01:52,636
- Stay tight, Ma.
- Come on. Get in here.

1643
02:02:06,568 --> 02:02:08,319
- Bee?
- Yeah.

1644
02:02:11,865 --> 02:02:12,948
- Hey!
- I don't know

1645
02:02:13,033 --> 02:02:14,992
what's going on, but we've got to move!

1646
02:02:19,164 --> 02:02:20,998
There's got to be a way out of here!

1647
02:02:22,334 --> 02:02:24,418
Judy, get back, get back, get back.

1648
02:02:25,629 --> 02:02:28,631
Against the wall! Against the wall!
Against the wall. Against the wall.

1649
02:02:30,008 --> 02:02:32,009
Bee! Bumblebee!

1650
02:02:32,844 --> 02:02:34,845
You get them somewhere safe,
all right?

1651
02:02:37,182 --> 02:02:38,348
You've got to get in the car
and get to safety.

1652
02:02:38,432 --> 02:02:40,266
No, this isn't up for discussion!

1653
02:02:40,351 --> 02:02:42,268
- You're my son! You're my son!
- I know.

1654
02:02:42,353 --> 02:02:43,603
- Dad...
- We all go together!

1655
02:02:43,687 --> 02:02:44,979
- Listen...
- We're all going together!

1656
02:02:45,064 --> 02:02:48,358
Dad, stop, okay? Get in the car.
He's gonna get you to safety.

1657
02:02:48,442 --> 02:02:50,693
You know, you run.
You don't stop, you don't hide, you run.

1658
02:02:50,778 --> 02:02:53,363
You hear what I'm saying, okay?
I'll find you when you're safe.

1659
02:02:53,447 --> 02:02:54,948
- No.
- You've got to let me go, Dad.

1660
02:02:55,032 --> 02:02:58,368
- You have to let me go. You have to.
- Ron.

1661
02:03:01,038 --> 02:03:03,498
Ron. Ron, let him go.

1662
02:03:05,542 --> 02:03:07,877
You come back! Come on.

1663
02:03:08,003 --> 02:03:09,754
Ron! Mikaela! Mikaela!

1664
02:03:09,838 --> 02:03:12,382
- Go with my parents.
- I'm not gonna go without you.

1665
02:03:23,686 --> 02:03:25,228
Move to cover!

1666
02:03:29,483 --> 02:03:31,234
We got Jordanians!

1667
02:03:31,318 --> 02:03:32,777
We got help!

1668
02:03:38,909 --> 02:03:40,159
Down!

1669
02:03:56,719 --> 02:03:58,344
You okay, soldier?

1670
02:03:58,429 --> 02:04:01,597
We're gonna help you, soldier. Let's
get these wounded clear of the bird.

1671
02:04:01,682 --> 02:04:03,598
Stay still. Stay still. Don't move.

1672
02:04:03,683 --> 02:04:05,976
You all right, young man?
You have a radio?

1673
02:04:07,437 --> 02:04:11,898
Hey, kid, it's been nice knowing you.
Remember what I did for my country.

1674
02:04:13,401 --> 02:04:15,068
This is my moment.

1675
02:04:15,820 --> 02:04:16,903
You're crazy!

1676
02:04:18,990 --> 02:04:20,866
ETA to station, two minutes.

1677
02:04:20,950 --> 02:04:22,826
- Put it on the main screen.
- Sir. Yes, sir.

1678
02:04:22,910 --> 02:04:24,286
Predator 01.

1679
02:04:34,797 --> 02:04:36,006
Shit, it's a trick.

1680
02:04:36,090 --> 02:04:38,508
Commence Operation Firestorm.
Send everyone.

1681
02:04:38,593 --> 02:04:41,178
- Get those Marines on the ground.
- Roll in strike packages...

1682
02:04:41,512 --> 02:04:43,138
Task Force Ripper, execute Lightning.

1683
02:05:03,659 --> 02:05:06,203
- Spotted Sam!
- Sam!

1684
02:05:06,662 --> 02:05:07,954
Ironhide!

1685
02:05:08,831 --> 02:05:10,999
Follow us to the pillars.
We'll take you to Optimus.

1686
02:05:13,836 --> 02:05:16,505
Get out, Sam! Get to the pillars!

1687
02:05:17,757 --> 02:05:18,840
Let's go.

1688
02:05:22,553 --> 02:05:26,056
Oh, God. This is it. The pyramid's built
right over the machine.

1689
02:05:26,140 --> 02:05:30,518
If they turn that machine on,
no more sun.

1690
02:05:32,979 --> 02:05:34,355
Not on my watch.

1691
02:05:34,773 --> 02:05:37,399
Not on my watch.

1692
02:05:48,370 --> 02:05:49,912
USS Stennis. Identify.

1693
02:05:49,996 --> 02:05:52,414
Where the hell are you?
Watching the Weather Channel?

1694
02:05:52,499 --> 02:05:54,375
SportsCenter?
I Dream of Jeannie or something?

1695
02:05:54,459 --> 02:05:58,462
We got 300 satellites up there.
Where the hell are all our men?

1696
02:05:58,547 --> 02:06:00,047
Identify yourself.

1697
02:06:00,549 --> 02:06:01,799
What is your name, sailor?

1698
02:06:02,384 --> 02:06:07,346
Wilder, Captain of the
USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier.

1699
02:06:08,682 --> 02:06:10,307
Okay, Captain Wilder.

1700
02:06:10,392 --> 02:06:12,726
This is Agent Seymour Simmons
of Sector Seven.

1701
02:06:12,811 --> 02:06:15,187
There is the mother
of all non-biologicals

1702
02:06:15,272 --> 02:06:17,064
getting ready to blow up our sun.

1703
02:06:17,149 --> 02:06:18,983
Do you want to have a throwdown
about my lack of clearance

1704
02:06:19,067 --> 02:06:21,068
or do you want to help save
a gazillion lives?

1705
02:06:22,070 --> 02:06:24,405
All right, Agent Simmons. I'm listening.

1706
02:06:31,580 --> 02:06:34,290
Five clicks west of the Gulf,

1707
02:06:34,374 --> 02:06:37,334
we got ourselves an alien
remodeling a pyramid.

1708
02:06:37,419 --> 02:06:40,462
Our one hope is a prototype weapon
called a rail gun,

1709
02:06:40,547 --> 02:06:43,591
- shoots a steel projectile at Mach 7.
- That's classified.

1710
02:06:43,675 --> 02:06:47,261
Don't talk to me about classified,
all right?

1711
02:06:47,345 --> 02:06:50,014
Now, if you've got a battleship
in the Gulf, which I know you do,

1712
02:06:50,098 --> 02:06:52,641
you tell them to ready that weapon!

1713
02:06:54,019 --> 02:06:56,227
Contact destroyer USS KIDD.

1714
02:06:57,104 --> 02:06:58,771
Alpha Team, flank left!

1715
02:06:58,856 --> 02:07:00,607
This way! Move it!

1716
02:07:02,568 --> 02:07:04,819
- Where do you need us, sir?
- Protect those in the line of fire.

1717
02:07:04,904 --> 02:07:06,529
Let's go! Go!

1718
02:07:10,451 --> 02:07:12,952
Give me your Comms. Come on. Epps!

1719
02:07:17,333 --> 02:07:19,709
Right now, we need air support, ASAP!

1720
02:07:19,793 --> 02:07:22,378
Have troops in contact 20 miles
northwest. Radar contact.

1721
02:07:22,463 --> 02:07:23,588
Proceed to 88 Alpha Sierra...

1722
02:07:27,676 --> 02:07:29,260
B-1, snap 090.

1723
02:07:29,345 --> 02:07:31,763
You are approved to drop your
2,000-pound JDAMs.

1724
02:07:38,979 --> 02:07:40,313
- What you got?
- I couldn't get to them, sir.

1725
02:07:40,397 --> 02:07:42,440
They're 600 meters away
and they're heading right for the pillars.

1726
02:07:42,524 --> 02:07:45,401
All right. Precious cargo's coming!

1727
02:07:45,736 --> 02:07:46,736
Move!

1728
02:07:57,581 --> 02:07:59,123
Curse you!

1729
02:08:13,097 --> 02:08:15,181
Sam! Spotted Sam!

1730
02:08:47,463 --> 02:08:49,214
- Come on!
- 2-2 covering fire.

1731
02:08:49,299 --> 02:08:50,716
Two civilians, 12 o'clock!

1732
02:08:59,267 --> 02:09:00,851
Cover for us!

1733
02:09:07,233 --> 02:09:10,027
Hold the air strike!
We're rescuing civilians!

1734
02:09:22,332 --> 02:09:23,915
Keep firing!

1735
02:09:29,922 --> 02:09:31,590
Come on! Mikaela!

1736
02:09:32,008 --> 02:09:34,343
Come on! Get in here!

1737
02:09:35,261 --> 02:09:36,720
Look who showed up.

1738
02:09:36,804 --> 02:09:38,805
You better have a good reason for us
to be here.

1739
02:09:38,890 --> 02:09:40,599
- Where's Optimus?
- He's right over there,

1740
02:09:40,683 --> 02:09:42,100
across the courtyard.

1741
02:09:42,810 --> 02:09:45,144
- I got to get to him right now.
- Not with an air strike coming.

1742
02:09:45,228 --> 02:09:47,438
I have to get to him right now.

1743
02:09:48,982 --> 02:09:50,316
Go. Back, back, back, back.

1744
02:09:50,400 --> 02:09:52,109
- Go.
- Listen up...

1745
02:09:55,572 --> 02:09:56,781
Okay.

1746
02:10:00,410 --> 02:10:01,786
Incoming!

1747
02:10:02,788 --> 02:10:04,997
Stick the landing.

1748
02:10:05,916 --> 02:10:08,793
Behold the glory of Jetfire!

1749
02:10:10,087 --> 02:10:13,631
Now let me show you how we brought
the pain in my day!

1750
02:10:33,693 --> 02:10:34,985
I'm too old for this crap.

1751
02:10:35,153 --> 02:10:37,822
Keep going, man, 15 rounds of fighting.

1752
02:10:57,968 --> 02:11:01,470
I am directly below
the enemy's scrotum.

1753
02:11:02,222 --> 02:11:05,516
25.7 meters above sea level,
29.32 north.

1754
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:07,810
- Kill track, 5205...
- Target acquired.

1755
02:11:07,894 --> 02:11:10,478
- Killing track.
- Two, one...

1756
02:11:10,563 --> 02:11:11,855
Fire!

1757
02:11:26,036 --> 02:11:27,704
Yeah! Yeah!

1758
02:11:28,080 --> 02:11:31,749
B-1's time on target, 30 seconds.
2,000-pound JDAMs inbound.

1759
02:11:31,834 --> 02:11:33,960
We're gonna make a break through
the B's on my command, okay?

1760
02:11:34,044 --> 02:11:36,963
You guys stick with me, you
understand? You stay on my ass.

1761
02:11:37,173 --> 02:11:40,425
- 1-1 tally orange smoke.
- I hope these F-16s got good aim.

1762
02:11:40,509 --> 02:11:44,053
- Yeah? Why is that?
- I told them to hit the orange smoke.

1763
02:11:45,639 --> 02:11:47,098
You mean that orange smoke?

1764
02:11:47,183 --> 02:11:48,766
It wasn't my best toss, okay?

1765
02:11:48,851 --> 02:11:51,603
- Viper, thunder.
- Run!

1766
02:12:00,613 --> 02:12:01,905
Incoming!

1767
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:06,242
Come on!

1768
02:12:26,514 --> 02:12:27,680
Sam!

1769
02:12:35,523 --> 02:12:36,772
Run!

1770
02:12:39,692 --> 02:12:40,776
Die!

1771
02:12:47,825 --> 02:12:49,076
Sam!

1772
02:13:05,301 --> 02:13:06,802
Hold your fire!

1773
02:13:09,222 --> 02:13:10,389
Sam!

1774
02:13:12,016 --> 02:13:14,268
Stay back! Mikaela, stay back!

1775
02:13:16,312 --> 02:13:18,355
Fucking do something!

1776
02:13:53,766 --> 02:14:00,022
- Sam! Sam!
- Sam! Sam! Sam! Sammy! Sam!

1777
02:14:01,815 --> 02:14:03,608
- Let me go!
- Come on, you got to move.

1778
02:14:03,692 --> 02:14:06,444
- You got to move, come on.
- We got no pulse.

1779
02:14:06,528 --> 02:14:07,653
Starting CPR.

1780
02:14:07,738 --> 02:14:10,948
- I have to see my kid! I got a son...
- Sammy!

1781
02:14:11,700 --> 02:14:12,825
Sam!

1782
02:14:15,162 --> 02:14:16,704
- Clear.
- Ready to shock.

1783
02:14:16,788 --> 02:14:19,540
- Clear!
- Ready to shock. One, two, three.

1784
02:14:22,502 --> 02:14:23,919
Do it again!

1785
02:14:29,426 --> 02:14:30,760
No!

1786
02:14:32,804 --> 02:14:37,892
Okay, listen to my voice.
I love you and I need you.

1787
02:14:39,144 --> 02:14:42,688
Please. Please, come back to me.
Sam, please!

1788
02:14:42,773 --> 02:14:44,357
I love you.

1789
02:14:53,742 --> 02:14:58,079
Where am I? Where am I?
Am I dead? Am I dead?

1790
02:14:58,580 --> 02:15:02,875
We have been watching you
a long, long time.

1791
02:15:05,253 --> 02:15:09,256
You have fought for Optimus,
our last descendant,

1792
02:15:09,341 --> 02:15:14,428
with courage and with sacrifice,
the virtues of a leader,

1793
02:15:15,347 --> 02:15:17,932
a leader worthy of our secret.

1794
02:15:18,475 --> 02:15:23,104
The Matrix of Leadership is not found,
it is earned.

1795
02:15:24,356 --> 02:15:26,565
Return now to Optimus.

1796
02:15:27,274 --> 02:15:29,609
Merge the Matrix with his spark.

1797
02:15:30,152 --> 02:15:34,739
It is, and always has been, your destiny.

1798
02:15:39,662 --> 02:15:40,787
Sam!

1799
02:15:47,294 --> 02:15:49,713
I love you. I love you.

1800
02:16:27,168 --> 02:16:30,503
Boy, you returned for me.

1801
02:16:31,839 --> 02:16:33,798
A living Prime.

1802
02:16:35,384 --> 02:16:37,594
I don't believe it!

1803
02:16:47,646 --> 02:16:50,064
My Matrix!

1804
02:16:55,403 --> 02:16:57,321
Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!

1805
02:16:58,198 --> 02:16:59,740
Get up, Prime!

1806
02:17:01,659 --> 02:17:03,035
Oh, no.

1807
02:17:03,369 --> 02:17:07,372
He's turning on the machine!
You got to stop him! Get up!

1808
02:17:07,874 --> 02:17:09,208
Optimus!

1809
02:17:11,419 --> 02:17:13,796
Fallen, my master.

1810
02:17:13,880 --> 02:17:18,342
My brothers could not stop me from this.

1811
02:17:19,219 --> 02:17:23,597
Yes, now I claim your sun.

1812
02:17:25,892 --> 02:17:29,019
- Move!
- Enemy target, top of pyramid. Engage!

1813
02:17:29,103 --> 02:17:30,646
Engage! Engage!

1814
02:17:36,110 --> 02:17:39,071
In moments, we'll be at firing strength.

1815
02:17:54,671 --> 02:17:59,216
All my Decepticon life, I never did
a thing worth doing until now.

1816
02:17:59,759 --> 02:18:02,678
Optimus, take my parts

1817
02:18:02,762 --> 02:18:05,931
and you will have a power
you've never known.

1818
02:18:06,891 --> 02:18:08,934
Fulfill your destiny.

1819
02:18:15,233 --> 02:18:17,067
Jolt! Electrify!

1820
02:18:17,526 --> 02:18:19,443
Transplant those afterburners.

1821
02:18:37,796 --> 02:18:39,422
Let's roll.

1822
02:18:41,884 --> 02:18:43,968
Fire mission on the pyramids.

1823
02:18:55,814 --> 02:18:59,275
This planet will be dark forever.

1824
02:19:21,506 --> 02:19:23,925
Die, like your brothers!

1825
02:19:24,551 --> 02:19:26,802
They were your brothers, too.

1826
02:19:55,665 --> 02:19:57,540
Starscream!

1827
02:20:10,554 --> 02:20:12,722
You picked the wrong planet.

1828
02:20:15,685 --> 02:20:17,560
Give me your face.

1829
02:20:26,070 --> 02:20:27,737
I rise.

1830
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:29,906
You fall.

1831
02:20:32,702 --> 02:20:35,120
No, no.

1832
02:20:37,206 --> 02:20:39,624
Not to call you a coward, Master,

1833
02:20:39,709 --> 02:20:45,380
but sometimes cowards do survive.

1834
02:20:45,965 --> 02:20:47,924
This isn't over.

1835
02:21:15,618 --> 02:21:18,495
It took all this for you to tell me that
you love me.

1836
02:21:20,123 --> 02:21:21,665
You said it first.

1837
02:22:12,842 --> 02:22:15,469
Thank you, Sam, for saving my life.

1838
02:22:16,763 --> 02:22:18,055
Welcome.

1839
02:22:18,848 --> 02:22:20,557
Thank you for believing in me.

1840
02:22:25,396 --> 02:22:29,942
Our races united by a history
long forgotten

1841
02:22:30,026 --> 02:22:33,445
and a future we shall face together.

1842
02:22:33,987 --> 02:22:36,405
I am Optimus Prime,

1843
02:22:36,490 --> 02:22:41,494
and I send this message so that our
pasts will always be remembered,

1844
02:22:41,578 --> 02:22:45,498
for in those memories, we live on.

1845
02:23:08,313 --> 02:23:11,190
So glad you could join us,
Professor Einstein.

1846
02:23:11,692 --> 02:23:13,609
Yeah, I was kind of busy.

1847
02:23:16,280 --> 02:23:17,488
Okay.
