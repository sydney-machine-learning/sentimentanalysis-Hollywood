00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,992
<i>When I was lying there in the VA hospital,</i>

2
00:00:42,117 --> 00:00:44,995
<i>with a big hole
blown through the middle of my life,</i>

3
00:00:45,829 --> 00:00:48,290
<i>I started having these dreams of flying.</i>

4
00:00:49,708 --> 00:00:51,126
<i>I was free.</i>

5
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,967
<i>Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.</i>

6
00:01:14,358 --> 00:01:16,277
<i>In cryo, you don't dream at all.</i>

7
00:01:17,236 --> 00:01:19,321
<i>It doesn't feel like six years.</i>

8
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:21,824
<i>More like a fifth of teguila
and an ass-kicking.</i>

9
00:01:28,372 --> 00:01:30,207
<i>Tommy was the scientist, not me.</i>

10
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:33,502
<i>He was the one who wanted to get shot
light-years out in space</i>

11
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:34,879
<i>to find the answers.</i>

12
00:01:35,546 --> 00:01:37,381
Are we there yet?

13
00:01:37,506 --> 00:01:39,258
Yeah, we're there, sunshine.

14
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,385
We're there.

15
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,928
<i>It's about your brother.</i>

16
00:01:46,724 --> 00:01:49,393
<i>So, a week
before Tommy's gonna ship out,</i>

17
00:01:49,518 --> 00:01:53,188
<i>a guy with a gun ends his journey
for the paper in his wallet.</i>

18
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:58,360
You've been in cryo for five years,
nine months and 22 days.

19
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:01,363
You will be hungry. You will be weak.

20
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,033
If you feel nausea, please use the sacks…

21
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:06,118
<i>Yeah, Tommy was the scientist.</i>

22
00:02:06,243 --> 00:02:09,413
<i>Me, I'm just another dumb grunt
going someplace he's gonna regret.</i>

23
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,304
<i>Up ahead was Pandora.</i>

24
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:30,684
<i>You grew up hearing about it,
but I never figured I'd be going there.</i>

25
00:02:40,778 --> 00:02:44,114
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

26
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,034
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

27
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,664
And since your genome is identical
to his, you could step into his shoes,

28
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:54,583
so to speak.

29
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:03,551
<i>It'd be a fresh start on a new world.</i>

30
00:03:11,475 --> 00:03:12,893
<i>And the pay is good.</i>

31
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:15,479
Very good.

32
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:40,796
— Exo-packs on! Let's go! Exo-packs on!
— Exo-packs on! Let's go!

33
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,214
Remember, people, you lose that mask,

34
00:03:42,339 --> 00:03:45,968
you're unconscious in 20 seconds,
you're dead in four minutes!

35
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:49,388
Let's nobody be dead today!
Looks very bad on my report.

36
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,851
Hell's Gate tower,
this is TAV 1-6 on approach.

37
00:03:53,976 --> 00:03:55,728
Crossing outer marker. Mine is in sight.

38
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:35,267
<i>One life ends,</i>

39
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:37,478
<i>another begins.</i>

40
00:04:44,944 --> 00:04:47,238
Harnesses off! Get your packs!

41
00:04:47,363 --> 00:04:50,783
— Put it together, let's go! Let's go!
— Harnesses off! One minute!

42
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:54,870
When that ramp comes down,
go directly into the base. Do not stop!

43
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,540
Go straight inside. Wait for my mark!

44
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:07,883
Go, go, go, go! Get out of there!
Keep moving! Let's go, let's go!

45
00:05:12,763 --> 00:05:14,765
<i>There's no such thing as an ex-Marine.</i>

46
00:05:15,808 --> 00:05:18,811
<i>You may be out,
but you never lose the attitude.</i>

47
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:22,940
<i>I told myself I could pass
any test a man could pass.</i>

48
00:05:27,903 --> 00:05:30,781
<i>They can fix a spinal, if you got the money,</i>

49
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:33,576
<i>but not on vet benefits,
not in this economy.</i>

50
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,414
Let's go, special case!
Do not make me wait for you!

51
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,207
Well, well, ladies.

52
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:43,502
Look at all this fresh meat!

53
00:05:49,341 --> 00:05:53,429
<i>Back on Earth,
these guys were Army dogs, Marines,</i>

54
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,014
<i>fighting for freedom.</i>

55
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,272
<i>Look out, hot rod!</i>

56
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:06,609
<i>But out here they're just hired guns,</i>

57
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,528
<i>taking the money,
working for the company.</i>

58
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:10,988
Check this out, man.

59
00:06:11,655 --> 00:06:13,115
Meals on wheels.

60
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,328
Oh, man, that is just wrong.

61
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,246
I got two guys free in about 20 minutes!

62
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:20,873
Got it! Need them !

63
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:32,426
<i>You're not in Kansas anymore.</i>

64
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:38,766
You are on Pandora, ladies and gentlemen.

65
00:06:38,891 --> 00:06:42,603
Respect that fact
every second of every day.

66
00:06:44,897 --> 00:06:46,482
If there is a hell,

67
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:51,862
you might want to go there for some R&R
after a tour on Pandora.

68
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:54,865
Out there, beyond that fence,

69
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:59,286
every living thing
that crawls, flies or squats in the mud

70
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:02,540
wants to kill you
and eat your eyes for Jujubes.

71
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:09,213
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

72
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:11,632
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neurotoxin

73
00:07:11,757 --> 00:07:14,510
that'll stop your heart in one minute.

74
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:18,931
And they have bones reinforced
with naturally occurring carbon fiber.

75
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:21,392
They are very hard to kill.

76
00:07:22,893 --> 00:07:26,855
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

77
00:07:28,816 --> 00:07:30,568
I will not succeed.

78
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:34,154
Not with all of you.

79
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:37,283
If you wish to survive,

80
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:40,244
you need to cultivate
a strong mental attitude.

81
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:43,247
You've got to obey the rules.

82
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:46,041
Pandora rules.

83
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:49,003
Rule number one…

84
00:07:49,128 --> 00:07:50,754
<i>There's nothing
like an old-school safety brief</i>

85
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,548
<i>to put your mind at ease.</i>

86
00:07:54,925 --> 00:08:00,431
Excuse me. Excuse me. Jake!
You're Jake, right? Tom's brother.

87
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,350
Wow! You look just like him.

88
00:08:03,475 --> 00:08:07,187
Sorry, I'm Norm. Spellman.
I went through avatar training with him.

89
00:08:07,313 --> 00:08:09,273
… into the bio-lab.

90
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:14,528
We're gonna spend a lot of time up here.
Hey! How you doing? Norm, avatar driver.

91
00:08:14,653 --> 00:08:15,863
— Hi.
— Hey.

92
00:08:15,988 --> 00:08:17,531
Link… Here's the link room right here.

93
00:08:17,656 --> 00:08:19,909
This is where
we're connecting to the avatar.

94
00:08:21,744 --> 00:08:23,787
<i>Me and Norm are here to drive</i>

95
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:27,041
<i>these remotely controlled bodies
called avatars.</i>

96
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:32,129
<i>And they're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives.</i>

97
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:34,173
— Hey. Welcome.
— Hey.

98
00:08:34,298 --> 00:08:36,634
— Welcome to Pandora. Good to have you.
— Thanks.

99
00:08:38,677 --> 00:08:40,512
Damn! They got big.

100
00:08:40,638 --> 00:08:43,140
Yeah, they fully mature on the flight out.

101
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:45,559
So the proprioceptive sims
seem to work really well.

102
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:47,519
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone.

103
00:08:47,645 --> 00:08:49,480
It'll take us a few hours
to get them decanted,

104
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,482
but you guys can take them out tomorrow.

105
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:53,359
There's yours.

106
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:56,654
Hey. Dr. Norm Spellman.

107
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:59,615
— Dr. Max Patel. Great to meet you.
— Good to meet you, yeah.

108
00:09:23,556 --> 00:09:25,015
Looks like him.

109
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:28,102
No, it looks like you.

110
00:09:29,228 --> 00:09:31,146
This is your avatar now, Jake.

111
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:38,779
<i>And the concept is that every driver
is matched to his own avatar,</i>

112
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:41,657
so that their nervous systems are in tune,

113
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:44,493
or something.

114
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,249
Which is why they offered me the gig,
because I can link with Tommy's avatar,

115
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:53,168
which is insanely expensive.

116
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:57,381
Is this right?
I just say whatever to the video log?

117
00:09:57,506 --> 00:09:59,633
Yeah, we gotta get in the habit
of documenting everything.

118
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:01,760
You know, what we see, what we feel.

119
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:04,555
— It's all part of the science.
— And good science is good observation.

120
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,057
Plus it'll help to keep you sane
for the next six years.

121
00:10:07,182 --> 00:10:09,935
All right. Whatever.

122
00:10:11,937 --> 00:10:13,564
So…

123
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,066
Well, here I am,

124
00:10:17,776 --> 00:10:19,236
doing science.

125
00:10:20,446 --> 00:10:21,989
They're coming out!

126
00:10:22,114 --> 00:10:24,575
<i>Attention. Drivers coming out of link.</i>

127
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,250
Oh, God.

128
00:10:35,169 --> 00:10:36,879
Where's the lab coat?
Where's the lab coat?

129
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:43,302
Who's got my goddamn cigarette?
Guys! What's wrong with this picture?

130
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,848
— Thank you!
— Grace Augustine is a legend.

131
00:10:47,973 --> 00:10:50,434
She's the head of the Avatar Program.
She wrote the book,

132
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,270
I mean, literally wrote the book
on Pandoran botany.

133
00:10:53,395 --> 00:10:55,606
Well, that's 'cause she likes plants
better than people.

134
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,983
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.

135
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:01,779
Grace, I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

136
00:11:03,572 --> 00:11:07,243
Norm. I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'vi?

137
00:11:08,327 --> 00:11:10,496
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>May the All Mother… </i>

138
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:12,665
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… smile upon our first meeting.</i>

139
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:15,960
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Not bad . You sound a little formal.</i>

140
00:11:17,211 --> 00:11:19,338
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>I studied for five years… </i>

141
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:21,507
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… butthere is much to learn.</i>

142
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:25,219
— Grace? This is Jake Sully.
— Ma'am.

143
00:11:25,803 --> 00:11:29,807
Yeah, yeah. I know who you are,
and I don't need you. I need your brother.

144
00:11:29,932 --> 00:11:33,519
You know, the PhD who trained
for three years for this mission?

145
00:11:33,644 --> 00:11:35,020
He's dead.

146
00:11:35,771 --> 00:11:38,065
I know it's a big inconvenience
for everyone.

147
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:42,486
— How much lab training have you had?
— I dissected a frog once.

148
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:47,074
You see? You see?
I mean, they're just pissing on us

149
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:49,493
without even the courtesy
of calling it rain.

150
00:11:49,618 --> 00:11:50,828
— I'm going to Selfridge.
— No, Grace,

151
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:53,497
— I don't think that's a good idea.
— No, man, this is such bullshit!

152
00:11:53,622 --> 00:11:54,999
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

153
00:11:55,124 --> 00:11:57,960
He has no business
sticking his nose in my department.

154
00:11:59,044 --> 00:12:02,798
Here tomorrow, 0800.
Try and use big words.

155
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:15,019
Scorpion Two-Hotel, Hell's Gate tower.
You are cleared for south departure.

156
00:12:15,144 --> 00:12:17,938
Hover taxi, Delta runway. Squawk ident.

157
00:12:23,861 --> 00:12:25,070
— You see that?
— Yes, sir.

158
00:12:25,196 --> 00:12:27,239
No, you didn't.
You were looking at the monitor.

159
00:12:27,364 --> 00:12:30,242
I love this putter, Ronnie!
I love this putter.

160
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,333
Parker, you know,
I used to think it was benign neglect,

161
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,377
but now I see
that you're intentionally screwing me.

162
00:12:40,502 --> 00:12:44,006
Grace, you know, I enjoy our little talks.

163
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:51,847
I need a researcher.
Not some jarhead dropout.

164
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,599
Well, actually,
I thought we got lucky with him.

165
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:55,184
— Lucky?
— Yeah.

166
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:57,269
How is this in any way lucky?

167
00:12:57,394 --> 00:12:59,104
Lucky your guy had a twin brother,

168
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,107
and lucky that brother wasn't
some oral hygienist or something.

169
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:04,109
A Marine we can use.

170
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:06,070
I'm assigning him
to your team as security escort.

171
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:09,615
The last thing I need is another
trigger-happy moron out there!

172
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,575
Look, look,
you're supposed to be winning the hearts

173
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,701
and the minds of the natives.

174
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,620
Isn't that the whole point of
your little puppet show?

175
00:13:14,745 --> 00:13:16,205
If you look like them
and you talk like them,

176
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,957
then they'll start trusting us.

177
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:20,042
We build them a school,
we teach them English,

178
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:22,127
but after, what, how many years?

179
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:23,754
Relations with the indigenous
are only getting worse.

180
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:27,091
Yeah, that tends to happen
when you use machine guns on them.

181
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:29,301
Right. Come here.

182
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:32,137
I can't… I can't…

183
00:13:35,391 --> 00:13:38,310
This is why we're here. Unobtanium.

184
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:41,480
Because this little gray rock sells
for 20 million a kilo.

185
00:13:41,605 --> 00:13:44,817
That's the only reason.
It's what pays for the whole party.

186
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:46,777
It's what pays for your science.

187
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:51,282
Now, those savages
are threatening our whole operation,

188
00:13:51,407 --> 00:13:52,616
we're on the brink of war,

189
00:13:52,741 --> 00:13:55,911
and you're supposed to be finding
a diplomatic solution.

190
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:59,498
So use what you've got,
and get me some results.

191
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:12,928
So, how much link time have you logged?

192
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:16,640
— About 520 hours.
— That's good.

193
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:21,061
You're in there.
You're here. How much have you logged?

194
00:14:21,186 --> 00:14:23,814
Zip. But I read a manual.

195
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:26,817
Tell me you're joking.

196
00:14:28,193 --> 00:14:29,528
This is cool.

197
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,405
Let's go.

198
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:37,036
Don't. I got this.

199
00:14:41,457 --> 00:14:44,001
So you just figured you'd come out here,

200
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:46,712
to the most hostile environment
known to man,

201
00:14:46,837 --> 00:14:50,549
with no training of any kind,
and see how it went?

202
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:52,927
What was going through your head?

203
00:14:53,052 --> 00:14:55,846
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

204
00:14:56,972 --> 00:14:59,225
— Biometrics are good.
— Link three is ready.

205
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:03,979
Keep your arms in, hands in, head down.

206
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:08,901
Down. Just relax
and let your mind go blank.

207
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,487
That shouldn't be hard for you.

208
00:15:11,612 --> 00:15:13,405
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white…

209
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:14,907
Initiate link.

210
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:18,202
Run sequence unit three. Go.

211
00:15:18,327 --> 00:15:19,745
Launching.

212
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:26,627
I have the first congruency.

213
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:40,558
— That's a gorgeous brain. Nice activity.
— Go figure.

214
00:15:40,683 --> 00:15:42,601
Phase-lock 40% .

215
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:48,148
All right. Going in.

216
00:15:48,816 --> 00:15:50,359
I'm going in in four.

217
00:15:53,445 --> 00:15:56,031
Phase-lock 99% . Link is stable.

218
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:16,760
He's in. Jake, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Jake?

219
00:16:16,886 --> 00:16:18,429
Pupillary reflex is good.

220
00:16:21,223 --> 00:16:24,226
Pinna response normal.
How you feeling, Jake?

221
00:16:24,977 --> 00:16:26,312
Hey, guys.

222
00:16:27,229 --> 00:16:28,939
Welcome to your new body, Jake.

223
00:16:29,064 --> 00:16:30,399
Good!

224
00:16:30,524 --> 00:16:31,984
Yeah, we're gonna take this
nice and easy, Jake.

225
00:16:32,109 --> 00:16:34,153
— And touch your thumb to your fingers.
— Yeah.

226
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:35,654
— Thumb to your fingers.
— No problem.

227
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:37,323
That's good.
I can see you can remember that one.

228
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:39,533
— Got it.
— Well, if you want to sit up,

229
00:16:39,658 --> 00:16:40,910
— that's fine.
— Okay, good. Just take it

230
00:16:41,035 --> 00:16:43,996
nice and slow, Jake. Good.
Okay, well, no truncal ataxia, that's good.

231
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:47,541
Are you feeling lightheaded or dizzy at all?
You're wiggling your toes!

232
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:49,376
— Good. Good, Jake.
— That's great.

233
00:16:50,961 --> 00:16:54,006
Distal motor control is good. Good, Jake.

234
00:16:54,131 --> 00:16:56,717
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

235
00:16:58,093 --> 00:16:59,345
That's great, Jake. Hold on, now.

236
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,680
Take it easy.
Don't get ahead of yourself, okay?

237
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:04,308
There's a few more sensory
motor reflex tests we need to run,

238
00:17:04,433 --> 00:17:06,477
— so take it easy.
— Wait.

239
00:17:06,602 --> 00:17:08,020
— Jake.
— Sit down, Jake.

240
00:17:08,145 --> 00:17:10,522
Jake! Listen to me. Jake!

241
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,858
— I need you to sit down. Jake!
— It's okay.

242
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:14,693
— Buddy, listen to me.
— It's all good. I got this.

243
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:18,447
— Jake, you need to sit down right now.
— Guys, get him back on the gurney now.

244
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,658
Listen to me.
For your own safety, you need to sit down.

245
00:17:20,783 --> 00:17:23,536
You need time to adjust to the avatar…
Whoa ! Jake!

246
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:25,871
— God, Jake, watch your tail.
— Yeah!

247
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:30,042
Sedate! Sedate him ! A thousand
milligrams of Supitocam ! Stat!

248
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:32,419
Guys! Guys! Whoa ! Whoa !

249
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:33,546
<i>By the numbers.</i>

250
00:17:33,671 --> 00:17:35,047
<i>— Jake. Come on.
— Jake! Listen to me.</i>

251
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:36,715
You're not used to your avatar body.

252
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,467
<i>— This is dangerous.
— This is great.</i>

253
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:41,804
<i>— Jake? Jake, listen to me.
— Come on. They're gonna put you out.</i>

254
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,059
— Norm, sit down.
— No, no. I gotta get out of these leads.

255
00:17:47,184 --> 00:17:48,727
God damn it! Bring them home!

256
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:51,438
— Norm ! Do not leave control!
— You're not ready for it!

257
00:17:53,232 --> 00:17:57,069
— Oh, come on, you ain't got no skills.
— So close!

258
00:17:57,194 --> 00:17:58,737
I don't even have to play defense on it.

259
00:17:58,863 --> 00:18:00,281
Hey, guys. Hey.

260
00:18:00,406 --> 00:18:02,658
— It's okay, I'll get him.
— Jake, you have to come back!

261
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:04,535
Jake! Jake! Excuse me.

262
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:08,706
— Watch it!
— Sorry!

263
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:10,249
Come on!

264
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,211
Jake! We're not supposed to be running!

265
00:18:23,804 --> 00:18:26,140
<i>— Jeez! Sorry.
— Watch it!</i>

266
00:18:48,454 --> 00:18:49,955
Hey, Marine!

267
00:18:50,831 --> 00:18:52,166
Damn.

268
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:57,379
— Grace?
— Well, who'd you expect, numbnuts?

269
00:18:58,672 --> 00:19:00,132
Think fast.

270
00:19:01,008 --> 00:19:03,177
Motor controI's looking good.

271
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:17,358
Come on, everybody, quiet down!
All right, gang, lights out.

272
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:19,568
Come on, Louise, chop-chop.

273
00:19:19,693 --> 00:19:21,111
Hey, hey, hey!

274
00:19:21,654 --> 00:19:23,864
Don't play with that, you'll go blind.

275
00:19:23,989 --> 00:19:25,407
That's kind of freaky.

276
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:27,952
Come on. Scat.

277
00:19:28,911 --> 00:19:30,329
Good night.

278
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:35,167
Lights out! See you at dinner, kiddies.

279
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:00,234
Welcome back.

280
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,536
— You okay? You all right?
— Yeah, I'm okay.

281
00:20:12,288 --> 00:20:17,501
I'm Trudy. I fly all the science sorties.
And this here is my baby.

282
00:20:18,127 --> 00:20:19,753
Hold on a second.

283
00:20:20,296 --> 00:20:23,173
Hey, Wainfleet! Get it done!

284
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:27,761
<i>— We bounce at zero-nine.
— Yeah, I'm on it, capitaine!</i>

285
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,431
Vine strike's still loose.

286
00:20:30,556 --> 00:20:32,683
You guys are packing some heavy gear.

287
00:20:32,808 --> 00:20:34,101
Watch it!

288
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,438
Yeah, that's 'cause we're not
the only thing flying around out there.

289
00:20:37,563 --> 00:20:39,189
Or the biggest.

290
00:20:39,315 --> 00:20:42,109
I'm gonna need you on a door gun.
I'm a man short.

291
00:20:42,234 --> 00:20:43,986
I thought you'd never ask.

292
00:20:45,362 --> 00:20:48,490
There's your man.
See you on the flight line.

293
00:20:59,251 --> 00:21:01,629
You wanted to see me, Colonel?

294
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:04,298
This low gravity'll make you soft.

295
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,301
You get soft,

296
00:21:10,554 --> 00:21:13,807
Pandora will shit you out dead
with zero warning.

297
00:21:14,934 --> 00:21:17,478
I pulled your record, Corporal.

298
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:19,980
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

299
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:24,235
Nothing like this here, though.

300
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:29,865
You got some heart, kid,
showing up in this neighborhood.

301
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,825
I figured it's just another hellhole.

302
00:21:31,951 --> 00:21:34,328
I was First Recon myself.

303
00:21:34,453 --> 00:21:37,665
A few years ahead of you.
Well, maybe more than a few.

304
00:21:38,624 --> 00:21:41,502
Three tours Nigeria, not a scratch.

305
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:43,045
I come out here?

306
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:47,132
Day one. Think I felt like a shavetail louie?

307
00:21:47,258 --> 00:21:51,762
Yeah. They could fix me up,
if I rotated back.

308
00:21:52,513 --> 00:21:57,518
Yeah, and make me pretty again.
But you know what? I kind of like it.

309
00:21:57,643 --> 00:22:00,479
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

310
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:08,362
The Avatar Program is a bad joke.
Bunch of limp-dick science majors.

311
00:22:08,487 --> 00:22:15,411
However, it does present an opportunity
both timely and unique.

312
00:22:15,536 --> 00:22:17,162
— Clear!
— Clear!

313
00:22:22,334 --> 00:22:27,464
A recon gyrene in an avatar body.
That's a potent mix.

314
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,216
Give me the goose bumps.

315
00:22:29,341 --> 00:22:32,720
Such a Marine could provide
the intel I need,

316
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:34,513
right on the ground.

317
00:22:35,806 --> 00:22:37,725
Right in the hostiles' camp.

318
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,856
Look, Sully. I want you
to learn these savages from the inside.

319
00:22:43,981 --> 00:22:45,608
I want you to gain their trust.

320
00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:47,443
I need to know
how to force their cooperation

321
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:50,070
or hammer them hard if they won't.

322
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:53,782
— Am I still with Augustine?
— On paper.

323
00:22:53,908 --> 00:22:57,995
Yeah, you walk like one of her
science pukes, you quack like one,

324
00:22:59,538 --> 00:23:01,081
but you report to me.

325
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:04,293
Can you do that for me, son?

326
00:23:05,878 --> 00:23:07,254
Hell, yeah, sir.

327
00:23:08,172 --> 00:23:09,924
Well, all right, then.

328
00:23:20,976 --> 00:23:23,854
Son, I take care of my own.

329
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:25,064
You get me what I need,

330
00:23:25,189 --> 00:23:28,400
I'll see to it you get your legs back
when you rotate home.

331
00:23:29,318 --> 00:23:30,778
Your real legs.

332
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:35,533
That sounds real good, sir.

333
00:23:42,206 --> 00:23:44,917
— Link's ready!
— Phase-lock 40% .

334
00:23:45,543 --> 00:23:48,629
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

335
00:23:48,754 --> 00:23:52,258
I have five congruencies. Phase-lock 90% .

336
00:23:52,383 --> 00:23:53,634
Link three ready.

337
00:23:54,343 --> 00:23:55,970
All right, I'm going in.

338
00:25:05,998 --> 00:25:08,375
Shut it down. We're gonna stay a while.

339
00:25:11,837 --> 00:25:15,591
— Norm ! Your pack.
— Pack.

340
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,223
Stay with the ship.
One idiot with a gun is enough.

341
00:25:24,725 --> 00:25:26,352
You the man, Doc.

342
00:26:02,972 --> 00:26:06,016
Prolemuris. They're not aggressive.

343
00:26:08,644 --> 00:26:12,106
Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.

344
00:26:17,695 --> 00:26:20,281
So, how will they know we're here?

345
00:26:20,406 --> 00:26:23,033
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

346
00:26:25,494 --> 00:26:27,454
— Keep moving, Norm.
— Keep up, guys!

347
00:26:29,874 --> 00:26:33,460
— And here I go.
— Scanning.

348
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,049
Wow! It's that fast?

349
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:43,387
— Amazing, isn't it?
— Yeah.

350
00:26:43,512 --> 00:26:47,266
So, that is signal transduction
from this root

351
00:26:47,391 --> 00:26:50,978
to the root of the tree next to it.
So, we should take a sample.

352
00:26:51,103 --> 00:26:52,730
Okay. Sample.

353
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:58,986
You know, it's probably electrical,
based on the speed of the reaction.

354
00:26:59,695 --> 00:27:03,616
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

355
00:27:04,074 --> 00:27:05,826
Right.

356
00:27:33,687 --> 00:27:35,523
So, here I go.

357
00:28:01,006 --> 00:28:04,843
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot, you'll piss him off.

358
00:28:08,597 --> 00:28:10,182
It's already pissed off.

359
00:28:10,432 --> 00:28:13,269
Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.

360
00:28:19,149 --> 00:28:23,237
It's a territorial threat display.
Do not run, or he'll charge.

361
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:25,614
So, what do I do, dance with it?

362
00:28:26,115 --> 00:28:29,159
Just hold your ground.

363
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,635
Yeah? Come on! What you got?

364
00:28:47,803 --> 00:28:49,763
Oh, yeah. Who's bad? That's right.

365
00:28:50,806 --> 00:28:53,142
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about, bitch.

366
00:28:54,727 --> 00:28:57,271
That's right,
get your punk ass back to mommy.

367
00:28:57,396 --> 00:29:00,274
Yeah? Yeah, you got nothing.
You keep running.

368
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,360
Yeah, and why don't you bring back
some of your friends, huh?

369
00:29:06,488 --> 00:29:07,615
Oh, shit.

370
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,879
So what about this one?
Run? Don't run? What?

371
00:29:23,339 --> 00:29:25,341
Run! Definitely run!

372
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:13,152
<i>I'm gonna have to call it, guys.</i>

373
00:33:13,277 --> 00:33:16,113
We're not allowed to run night ops.
Colonel's orders.

374
00:33:17,907 --> 00:33:21,118
<i>I'm sorry, Doc, he's just gonna have to
hang on till morning.</i>

375
00:33:21,243 --> 00:33:22,786
He won't make it till morning.

376
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:17,651
I don't have all goddamn night.

377
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:20,613
Come on! Come on!

378
00:36:34,603 --> 00:36:36,188
Hey, wait. Don't!

379
00:36:39,775 --> 00:36:40,818
Great.

380
00:37:38,334 --> 00:37:41,837
Look, I know you probably don't
understand this,

381
00:37:47,968 --> 00:37:49,136
but thank you.

382
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,726
Thank you.

383
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,190
That was pretty impressive.

384
00:38:03,984 --> 00:38:06,862
I would have been screwed
if you hadn't come along. It was…

385
00:38:10,491 --> 00:38:13,536
Hey, wait a second. Hey, where you going?

386
00:38:14,578 --> 00:38:15,996
Wait up!

387
00:38:16,789 --> 00:38:18,541
Just… Hey, slow down.

388
00:38:18,666 --> 00:38:21,669
Look, wait up, I just wanted to say
thanks for killing those things.

389
00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:25,839
— Damn!
— Don't thank.

390
00:38:26,757 --> 00:38:29,093
You don't thank for this.

391
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:34,598
This is sad. Very sad only.

392
00:38:35,558 --> 00:38:37,643
Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

393
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:40,271
Whatever I did, I am sorry.

394
00:38:43,816 --> 00:38:46,944
All this is your fault.
They did not need to die.

395
00:38:47,862 --> 00:38:49,864
My fault? They attacked me.
How am I the bad guy?

396
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:51,615
Your fault!

397
00:38:52,116 --> 00:38:54,827
— Your fault!
— Easy. Easy.

398
00:38:54,952 --> 00:38:58,581
You're like a baby.
Making noise, don't know what to do.

399
00:38:58,706 --> 00:39:00,124
Easy.

400
00:39:02,418 --> 00:39:04,795
Fine. Fine.

401
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:08,090
If you love your little forest friends,

402
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:11,510
why not let them just kill my ass?

403
00:39:12,553 --> 00:39:14,263
What's the thinking?

404
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:17,766
— Why save you?
— Yeah. Yeah, why save me?

405
00:39:22,271 --> 00:39:24,190
You have a strong heart.

406
00:39:26,317 --> 00:39:27,526
No fear.

407
00:39:32,072 --> 00:39:34,909
But stupid! Ignorant like a child.

408
00:39:41,332 --> 00:39:43,751
Well, if I'm like a child, then…

409
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,587
Look, maybe you should teach me.

410
00:39:46,712 --> 00:39:48,923
Sky People cannot learn. You do not See.

411
00:39:49,048 --> 00:39:50,841
Well, then teach me how to See.

412
00:39:50,966 --> 00:39:53,427
— No one can teach you to See.
— Whoa.

413
00:39:54,803 --> 00:39:57,223
Look, come on, can't we talk?

414
00:39:58,182 --> 00:40:02,061
Say, where'd you learn to speak English?
Dr. Augustine's school?

415
00:40:06,899 --> 00:40:08,609
You're like a baby.

416
00:40:14,823 --> 00:40:16,408
I need your help.

417
00:40:17,493 --> 00:40:19,328
You should not be here.

418
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:23,123
— Okay, take me with you.
— No! Go back.

419
00:40:25,834 --> 00:40:26,835
No.

420
00:40:28,337 --> 00:40:29,547
Go back.

421
00:40:51,193 --> 00:40:52,194
No!

422
00:41:14,049 --> 00:41:15,175
What…

423
00:41:19,013 --> 00:41:20,472
What are they?

424
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:23,809
Seeds of the Sacred Tree.

425
00:41:24,894 --> 00:41:26,520
Very pure spirits.

426
00:41:50,628 --> 00:41:52,546
What was that all about?

427
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:55,758
Come.

428
00:41:57,259 --> 00:41:58,302
Come!

429
00:42:00,554 --> 00:42:02,223
Where are we going?

430
00:42:12,441 --> 00:42:13,526
Come.

431
00:42:18,197 --> 00:42:19,907
What's your name?

432
00:42:20,032 --> 00:42:21,075
Shit!

433
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,643
Okay.

434
00:42:50,396 --> 00:42:53,190
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Calm people, calm.</i>

435
00:42:58,946 --> 00:43:01,740
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>What are you doing, Tsu'tey?</i>

436
00:43:04,243 --> 00:43:07,079
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>These demons are forbidden here .</i>

437
00:43:07,955 --> 00:43:10,207
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>There has been a sign.</i>

438
00:43:10,332 --> 00:43:12,626
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>This is a matter for the Tsahik.</i>

439
00:43:17,464 --> 00:43:18,424
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Bring him.</i>

440
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,635
What's going on?

441
00:43:24,013 --> 00:43:25,055
Wait.

442
00:43:28,058 --> 00:43:29,643
What's happening?

443
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:31,562
Hey!

444
00:44:41,674 --> 00:44:42,925
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Father. … </i>

445
00:44:43,842 --> 00:44:45,594
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… I see you.</i>

446
00:44:57,398 --> 00:44:58,774
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>This creature … </i>

447
00:44:59,108 --> 00:45:02,152
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… why do you bring him here?</i>

448
00:45:03,612 --> 00:45:04,989
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>I was going to kill him… </i>

449
00:45:05,322 --> 00:45:07,116
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… but there was a sing from Eywa.</i>

450
00:45:07,324 --> 00:45:09,285
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>I have said… </i>

451
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:11,579
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… no dreamwalker will come here .</i>

452
00:45:11,704 --> 00:45:13,038
What's he saying?

453
00:45:13,539 --> 00:45:15,958
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>His alien smell fills my nose.</i>

454
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:17,084
Hey, what's he saying?

455
00:45:17,209 --> 00:45:19,962
My father is deciding whether to kill you.

456
00:45:21,463 --> 00:45:24,383
Your father. It's nice to meet you, sir.

457
00:45:28,012 --> 00:45:29,430
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Step back!</i>

458
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,768
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>I will look at this alien.</i>

459
00:45:34,894 --> 00:45:36,437
That is Mother.

460
00:45:36,562 --> 00:45:40,482
<i>She is Tsahik.
The one who interprets the will of Eywa.</i>

461
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:42,693
Who's Eywa?

462
00:45:49,575 --> 00:45:51,285
What are you called?

463
00:45:52,286 --> 00:45:53,621
Jake Sully.

464
00:46:03,547 --> 00:46:06,300
— Why did you come to us?
— I came to learn.

465
00:46:07,718 --> 00:46:10,638
We have tried to teach other Sky People.

466
00:46:10,763 --> 00:46:14,099
It is hard to fill a cup which is already full.

467
00:46:15,601 --> 00:46:17,895
Well, my cup is empty, trust me.

468
00:46:19,188 --> 00:46:21,815
Just ask Dr. Augustine. I'm no scientist.

469
00:46:21,941 --> 00:46:23,317
What are you?

470
00:46:25,611 --> 00:46:28,822
I was a Marine. A…

471
00:46:29,698 --> 00:46:32,326
A warrior of the Jarhead clan.

472
00:46:32,785 --> 00:46:33,994
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Awarrior!</i>

473
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:35,579
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>I could kill him easily!</i>

474
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:36,830
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>I could kill him easily!
No!</i>

475
00:46:37,373 --> 00:46:41,502
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>This is the firstwarrior dreamwalker… </i>

476
00:46:41,627 --> 00:46:43,462
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… we have seen.</i>

477
00:46:43,587 --> 00:46:46,340
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>We need to learn more about him .</i>

478
00:46:48,842 --> 00:46:50,678
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>My Daughter… </i>

479
00:46:50,803 --> 00:46:55,057
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… you will teach him our way… </i>

480
00:46:55,182 --> 00:46:58,561
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… to speak and walk as we do.</i>

481
00:46:58,686 --> 00:47:02,231
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Why me? That's not fair… </i>

482
00:47:03,107 --> 00:47:07,194
It is decided.
My daughter will teach you our ways.

483
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:10,865
Learn well, Jakesully.

484
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:15,494
Then we will see
if your insanity can be cured.

485
00:47:34,221 --> 00:47:35,681
Good evening.

486
00:47:38,726 --> 00:47:40,477
Please don't get up.

487
00:47:42,396 --> 00:47:43,689
Excuse me.

488
00:47:46,025 --> 00:47:47,151
Sorry.

489
00:47:50,279 --> 00:47:51,989
Hey, how you doing?

490
00:48:35,699 --> 00:48:37,952
<i>— Jake. Jake!
— He's in alpha.</i>

491
00:48:38,077 --> 00:48:41,080
— He's coming out right now.
— Jake. Jake!

492
00:48:42,957 --> 00:48:45,960
Come on back, kid. Come on. That's it.

493
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:50,297
There you go. There you go, there you go.

494
00:48:50,422 --> 00:48:52,758
You're okay. You're okay.

495
00:48:52,883 --> 00:48:55,761
Damn! You were dug in like a tick.

496
00:48:58,889 --> 00:49:01,433
— Is the avatar safe?
— Yeah, Doc.

497
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,271
And you are not gonna believe where I am.

498
00:49:06,313 --> 00:49:09,275
The last thing we see is this Marine's ass

499
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:13,404
disappearing into the brush with
this angry thanator coming after him.

500
00:49:13,529 --> 00:49:16,448
— Hey, it's not something you can teach.
— That is awesome.

501
00:49:16,574 --> 00:49:18,868
You know, for reasons I cannot fathom,

502
00:49:18,993 --> 00:49:22,246
the Omaticaya have chosen you.
God help us all.

503
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:25,082
«Jarhead clan»?

504
00:49:26,709 --> 00:49:29,712
— And it worked?
— Hey, I'm practically family.

505
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:34,258
They're gonna study me.
I have to learn to be one of them.

506
00:49:34,383 --> 00:49:35,926
That's called taking the initiative, son.

507
00:49:36,051 --> 00:49:38,512
— I wish I had 10 more like you.
— Look, Sully. Sully.

508
00:49:38,637 --> 00:49:42,016
Just find out what the blue monkeys want.

509
00:49:42,808 --> 00:49:48,564
You know, I mean, we try to give them
medicine, education, roads.

510
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:50,482
But no, no, no, they like mud.

511
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:54,486
And that wouldn't bother me,
it's just that they're…

512
00:49:55,112 --> 00:49:58,157
Hey, can you… Can somebody just…
Sector 12.

513
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:03,078
Okay, go, go, go, stop. Stop…

514
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:05,289
Rich, stop! That's… Jesus!

515
00:50:05,414 --> 00:50:11,462
Their damn village happens to be resting
on the richest unobtanium deposit

516
00:50:11,587 --> 00:50:16,884
within 200 klicks in any direction.
I mean, look at all that cheddar!

517
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:23,182
— Well, who gets them to move?
— Guess.

518
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:28,604
— What if they won't go?
— I'm betting that they will.

519
00:50:29,146 --> 00:50:31,815
Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey. Look. Look.

520
00:50:32,691 --> 00:50:35,528
Killing the indigenous looks bad,

521
00:50:35,653 --> 00:50:39,365
but there's one thing that shareholders
hate more than bad press,

522
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:42,618
and that's a bad quarterly statement.
I didn't make up the rules.

523
00:50:42,743 --> 00:50:45,871
So just find me a carrot
that'll get them to move,

524
00:50:46,664 --> 00:50:49,708
otherwise it's gonna have to be
all stick. Okay?

525
00:50:50,334 --> 00:50:54,046
You got three months.
That's when the 'dozers get there.

526
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:56,090
Well, we're wasting time.

527
00:50:57,091 --> 00:50:58,175
I like this guy.

528
00:50:58,425 --> 00:51:01,804
— Guys, right now…
— Okay, let's run through them again.

529
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:04,223
Mo'at. Dragon lady.

530
00:51:06,267 --> 00:51:09,228
— Eytucan.
— Eytukan. He's the clan leader.

531
00:51:09,353 --> 00:51:12,439
But she's the spiritual leader.
Like a shaman.

532
00:51:12,565 --> 00:51:14,108
Got it.

533
00:51:14,233 --> 00:51:16,402
— T'su'tey.
— Tsu'tey.

534
00:51:16,527 --> 00:51:19,238
— Tsu'tey.
— He'll be the next clan leader.

535
00:51:21,282 --> 00:51:23,742
<i>— Neytiri.
— She'll be the next Tsahik.</i>

536
00:51:23,868 --> 00:51:25,786
They become a mated pair.

537
00:51:26,829 --> 00:51:29,123
— So who's this Eywa?
— Who's Eywa?

538
00:51:30,082 --> 00:51:33,627
Only their deity. Their goddess,
made up of all living things.

539
00:51:33,752 --> 00:51:35,087
Everything they know!

540
00:51:35,212 --> 00:51:37,256
You'd know this
if you had any training whatsoever.

541
00:51:37,381 --> 00:51:38,716
Who's got a date
with the chief's daughter?

542
00:51:38,841 --> 00:51:40,467
— Come on. That's…
— All right, knock it off, you two.

543
00:51:40,593 --> 00:51:43,095
Let's go. Village life starts early.

544
00:51:45,306 --> 00:51:47,766
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

545
00:52:06,827 --> 00:52:08,120
Easy, boy.

546
00:52:08,787 --> 00:52:10,831
Pale is female.

547
00:52:13,834 --> 00:52:16,212
Okay. Easy, girl.

548
00:52:45,032 --> 00:52:48,744
<i>That is tsaheylu. The bond.</i>

549
00:52:50,955 --> 00:52:52,164
Feel her.

550
00:52:55,376 --> 00:52:59,421
Feel her heartbeat. Her breath.

551
00:53:02,466 --> 00:53:04,218
Feel her strong legs.

552
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,014
You may tell her what to do.

553
00:53:09,139 --> 00:53:10,307
lnside.

554
00:53:11,308 --> 00:53:14,186
For now, say where to go.

555
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:18,440
Forward!

556
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:39,169
— You should go away.
— No, you'd miss me.

557
00:53:40,629 --> 00:53:42,882
I knew you could speak English.

558
00:53:45,426 --> 00:53:47,511
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>This alien will learn nothing… </i>

559
00:53:48,012 --> 00:53:49,555
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… a rock sees more … </i>

560
00:53:50,014 --> 00:53:51,807
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… look at him .</i>

561
00:54:01,275 --> 00:54:02,276
Again.

562
00:54:02,401 --> 00:54:05,821
lf you want to hit this thing,
it's gonna be complicated.

563
00:54:05,946 --> 00:54:08,407
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

564
00:54:08,532 --> 00:54:10,534
There's an outer row of columns.

565
00:54:10,659 --> 00:54:13,370
Real heavy duty.
There's a secondary ring here,

566
00:54:13,495 --> 00:54:17,082
and an inner ring.
There's a core structure like a spiral.

567
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:19,585
That's how they move up and down.

568
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:22,504
We're gonna need accurate scans
on every column.

569
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:23,923
Roger that.

570
00:54:24,048 --> 00:54:26,675
What else can you tell us
about the structure?

571
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,595
I'm guessing this secondary ring,
that's also load-bearing.

572
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:37,603
— So where are we going?
— Getting out of Dodge.

573
00:54:38,979 --> 00:54:43,108
I'm not about to let Selfridge
and Quaritch micro-manage this thing.

574
00:54:43,234 --> 00:54:46,445
There's a mobile link
up at Site 26 we can work out of,

575
00:54:46,570 --> 00:54:48,489
way up in the mountains.

576
00:54:49,281 --> 00:54:51,575
The Hallelujah Mountains?

577
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:53,953
— That's right.
— Are you serious?

578
00:54:54,078 --> 00:54:55,955
— Yeah.
— Yes!

579
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:03,128
The legendary floating mountains
of Pandora. Heard of them?

580
00:55:16,684 --> 00:55:18,477
We're getting close.

581
00:55:18,602 --> 00:55:21,230
Yeah, look at my instruments.

582
00:55:21,355 --> 00:55:24,275
Yep. We're in the Flux Vortex.

583
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,610
We're VFR from here on.

584
00:55:26,735 --> 00:55:28,571
What's VFR?

585
00:55:28,696 --> 00:55:30,990
Means you gotta see where you're going.

586
00:55:31,115 --> 00:55:34,994
— You can't see anything.
— Exactly. Ain't that a bitch?

587
00:55:53,554 --> 00:55:56,140
Oh, my God.

588
00:56:07,193 --> 00:56:08,527
You should see your faces.

589
00:56:35,763 --> 00:56:38,140
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

590
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,244
Welcome to camp.

591
00:57:02,122 --> 00:57:06,752
— So, this is my bunk.
— This stuff is nasty.

592
00:57:08,128 --> 00:57:10,089
— Norm, go under.
— All right.

593
00:57:10,214 --> 00:57:13,676
<i>— Grace didn't miss a thing.
— Trudy, you'll take the top one.</i>

594
00:57:13,801 --> 00:57:16,178
<i>She knew I was talking to the Colonel.</i>

595
00:57:16,303 --> 00:57:19,890
<i>But I had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan,</i>

596
00:57:20,015 --> 00:57:21,600
<i>so she's playing nice.</i>

597
00:57:21,725 --> 00:57:26,730
All right. Jake, hang a left.
You'll be in the link at the end.

598
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:33,696
Unit one. Beulah. She's the least glitchy.

599
00:58:22,953 --> 00:58:24,246
Holy shit!

600
00:58:25,206 --> 00:58:27,041
Do not look in her eye.

601
00:58:35,633 --> 00:58:37,343
<i>lkran is not horse.</i>

602
00:58:38,511 --> 00:58:40,346
<i>Once tsaheylu is made,</i>

603
00:58:44,225 --> 00:58:48,521
<i>ikran will fly with only one hunter
in the whole life.</i>

604
00:58:58,489 --> 00:59:01,200
<i>To become taronyu, hunter,</i>

605
00:59:01,325 --> 00:59:04,870
<i>you must choose your own ikran
and he must choose you.</i>

606
00:59:07,456 --> 00:59:09,458
— When?
— When you are ready.

607
00:59:59,884 --> 01:00:03,012
Okay. This is video log 12.

608
01:00:04,221 --> 01:00:05,890
Time's 2132.

609
01:00:07,349 --> 01:00:10,686
Do I have to do this now?
I really need to get some rack.

610
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:13,606
No, now. When it's fresh.

611
01:00:16,317 --> 01:00:18,110
Okay, location, shack,

612
01:00:19,111 --> 01:00:21,447
and the days are starting to blur together.

613
01:00:23,574 --> 01:00:26,744
<i>The language is a pain, but, you know,</i>

614
01:00:26,869 --> 01:00:29,997
<i>I figure it's like field-stripping a weapon.
Just repetition, repetition.</i>

615
01:00:30,122 --> 01:00:31,707
<i>— Navi.
— '»Nari. '»</i>

616
01:00:31,832 --> 01:00:33,918
<i>— Nari.
— '»Narrri'»!</i>

617
01:00:34,168 --> 01:00:35,377
<i>Narrri!</i>

618
01:00:36,337 --> 01:00:38,339
<i>Txur ni'ul. Stronger.</i>

619
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:46,639
<i>Neytiri calls me skxawng. It means moron.</i>

620
01:00:48,974 --> 01:00:50,392
This is a very important part of it.

621
01:00:50,518 --> 01:00:52,603
<i>— Norm 's attitude has improved lately.
— I see you. I see you.</i>

622
01:00:52,728 --> 01:00:55,064
But it's not just,
«I'm seeing you in front of me,»

623
01:00:55,189 --> 01:00:56,815
it's «I see into you. I See you.»

624
01:00:56,941 --> 01:00:59,527
<i>It's good he's back on board,
but he thinks I'm a skxawng, too.</i>

625
01:00:59,652 --> 01:01:01,862
«I'm accepting you. I understand you.»
So you gotta get this, okay?

626
01:01:02,238 --> 01:01:05,157
I gotta run! Okay? Let's go.

627
01:01:05,991 --> 01:01:09,537
<i>My feet are getting tougher.
I can run farther every day.</i>

628
01:01:11,455 --> 01:01:14,542
<i>I have to trust my body
to know what to do.</i>

629
01:01:19,713 --> 01:01:21,382
Yeah! Check it out!

630
01:01:22,216 --> 01:01:23,467
Oh, crap!

631
01:01:27,763 --> 01:01:32,601
<i>Every day it's reading the trails,
the tracks at the waterhole,</i>

632
01:01:32,726 --> 01:01:34,895
<i>the tiniest scents and sounds.</i>

633
01:01:40,484 --> 01:01:45,239
<i>She's always going on about
the flow of energy, the spirits of animals.</i>

634
01:01:46,073 --> 01:01:48,701
<i>I really hope this tree-hugger crap
isn't on the final.</i>

635
01:01:48,826 --> 01:01:52,454
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there, you know.

636
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,207
You need to listen to what she says.

637
01:01:55,332 --> 01:01:58,460
Try to see the forest through her eyes.

638
01:01:58,586 --> 01:02:01,130
Excuse me. This is my video log here.

639
01:02:16,562 --> 01:02:19,106
<i>With Neytiri, it's learn fast or die.</i>

640
01:02:20,441 --> 01:02:22,526
You gotta be kidding me.

641
01:02:51,639 --> 01:02:53,724
<i>I talked Mo'at into
letting Grace into the village.</i>

642
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:56,519
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Look how big you are.</i>

643
01:02:56,727 --> 01:02:57,478
<i>It's the first time
since her school was closed down.</i>

644
01:02:57,603 --> 01:02:59,396
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>You areso pretty .</i>

645
01:03:00,898 --> 01:03:03,692
No, you don't. Come back here.

646
01:03:05,528 --> 01:03:06,570
<i>Bon appe'tit.</i>

647
01:03:34,181 --> 01:03:35,766
Come on, Marine.

648
01:04:01,041 --> 01:04:03,669
<i>I'm trying to understand
this deep connection</i>

649
01:04:03,794 --> 01:04:06,005
<i>the people have to the forest.</i>

650
01:04:06,505 --> 01:04:09,300
<i>She talks about a network of energy</i>

651
01:04:10,134 --> 01:04:12,678
<i>that flows through all living things.</i>

652
01:04:13,596 --> 01:04:16,891
<i>She says all energy is only borrowed,</i>

653
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:20,394
<i>and one day you have to give it back.</i>

654
01:04:43,334 --> 01:04:44,376
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>I see you… </i>

655
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,669
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… Brother</i>

656
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:48,339
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… and thank you.</i>

657
01:04:52,510 --> 01:04:54,345
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Your spirit goes with Eywa.</i>

658
01:04:55,012 --> 01:04:56,722
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Your body stays behind… </i>

659
01:04:57,056 --> 01:04:59,683
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… to become part of The People.</i>

660
01:05:03,479 --> 01:05:04,897
A clean kill.

661
01:05:08,275 --> 01:05:09,735
You are ready.

662
01:05:35,427 --> 01:05:38,764
<i>Learning to ride an ikran,
we call them banshees,</i>

663
01:05:38,889 --> 01:05:41,433
<i>is the test every young hunter has to pass.</i>

664
01:05:43,686 --> 01:05:46,981
<i>But to do that,
you gotta go where the banshees are.</i>

665
01:05:47,857 --> 01:05:49,024
<i>Oo-rah.</i>

666
01:06:20,556 --> 01:06:21,807
Now what?

667
01:07:51,814 --> 01:07:53,732
Jakesully will go first.

668
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:30,603
<i>Now you choose your ikran.
This you must feel inside.</i>

669
01:08:31,562 --> 01:08:34,481
lf he also chooses you,
move quick like I showed.

670
01:08:34,607 --> 01:08:37,401
You will have one chance, Jake.

671
01:08:37,526 --> 01:08:39,612
How will I know if he chooses me?

672
01:08:39,737 --> 01:08:41,655
He will try to kill you.

673
01:08:42,865 --> 01:08:44,241
Outstanding.

674
01:09:44,552 --> 01:09:45,928
Let's dance.

675
01:09:52,059 --> 01:09:53,894
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>That moron's going to die.</i>

676
01:10:17,835 --> 01:10:19,545
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Don't be afraid, warrior.</i>

677
01:10:19,712 --> 01:10:21,172
Make the bond!

678
01:10:24,633 --> 01:10:25,634
No!

679
01:10:29,638 --> 01:10:30,681
Jake!

680
01:10:44,778 --> 01:10:46,322
<i>Tsaheylu, Jake.</i>

681
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:49,950
<i>Tsaheylu!</i>

682
01:11:00,127 --> 01:11:01,170
Stop!

683
01:11:09,845 --> 01:11:14,934
Yeah, that's right. You're mine. Huh?

684
01:11:28,197 --> 01:11:31,075
First flight seals the bond.
You cannot wait.

685
01:11:32,618 --> 01:11:34,787
— Think, «Fly! "
— Fly?

686
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:44,672
God damn!

687
01:11:49,093 --> 01:11:50,344
Oh, shit!

688
01:11:59,812 --> 01:12:01,981
Shut up and fly straight!

689
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:14,535
That's it. Bank left!

690
01:12:23,919 --> 01:12:25,671
Level out! That's it.

691
01:12:31,177 --> 01:12:32,469
Jakesully!

692
01:12:57,286 --> 01:12:58,329
Hey!

693
01:13:04,418 --> 01:13:05,669
Let's go!

694
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:20,017
Yeah, baby, I got this!

695
01:13:20,893 --> 01:13:22,102
Oh, shit!

696
01:13:27,483 --> 01:13:31,153
<i>I may not be much of a horse guy,
but I was born to do this.</i>

697
01:13:32,029 --> 01:13:33,113
Yeah!

698
01:13:34,114 --> 01:13:37,159
— I came like this. This you.
— Yeah, yeah.

699
01:13:37,284 --> 01:13:42,248
— I turn. I feel the wind. I turn very strong.
— Look, yeah, see, I banked so hard…

700
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:46,312
<i>The Tree of Souls.</i>

701
01:14:49,732 --> 01:14:51,901
It's their most sacred place.

702
01:14:52,735 --> 01:14:55,529
See the Flux Vortex
in these false color images?

703
01:14:55,654 --> 01:14:57,698
Yeah, that's what messes up
my instruments.

704
01:14:57,823 --> 01:15:02,328
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologically.

705
01:15:03,746 --> 01:15:05,789
I would die to get samples.

706
01:15:06,415 --> 01:15:09,210
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

707
01:15:09,335 --> 01:15:10,711
You lucky swine.

708
01:15:18,135 --> 01:15:21,847
<i>I was a stone-cold aerial hunter.
Death from above.</i>

709
01:15:23,224 --> 01:15:26,185
<i>Only problem is, you're not the only one.</i>

710
01:15:30,105 --> 01:15:31,190
Dive!

711
01:15:53,963 --> 01:15:55,130
Go, go!

712
01:16:03,347 --> 01:16:04,640
Follow me!

713
01:16:51,145 --> 01:16:53,689
Our guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

714
01:16:54,607 --> 01:16:57,651
<i>It is Toruk. Last Shadow.</i>

715
01:16:59,403 --> 01:17:02,489
Yeah, right. It's the last one you ever see.

716
01:17:07,161 --> 01:17:10,873
<i>My grandfather's grandfather
was Toruk Macto.</i>

717
01:17:11,582 --> 01:17:13,334
Rider of Last Shadow.

718
01:17:14,752 --> 01:17:16,170
He rode this?

719
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:19,423
<i>Toruk chose him.</i>

720
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,677
It has only happened five times
since the time of the First Songs.

721
01:17:23,802 --> 01:17:25,721
— That's a long time.
— Yes.

722
01:17:26,472 --> 01:17:28,349
<i>Toruk Macto was mighty.</i>

723
01:17:30,226 --> 01:17:33,938
He brought the clans together
in a time of great sorrow.

724
01:17:34,063 --> 01:17:36,357
All Na'vi people know the story.

725
01:17:43,072 --> 01:17:47,243
<i>Everything is backwards now.
Like out there is the true world</i>

726
01:17:48,410 --> 01:17:50,371
<i>and in here is the dream.</i>

727
01:18:10,933 --> 01:18:13,602
<i>It's hard to believe
it's only been three months.</i>

728
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:19,108
I can barely remember my old life.

729
01:18:22,695 --> 01:18:24,530
I don't know who I am anymore.

730
01:18:43,299 --> 01:18:46,093
Haven't gotten lost in the woods,
have you?

731
01:18:49,305 --> 01:18:52,224
Your last report was
more than two weeks ago.

732
01:18:54,476 --> 01:18:56,937
I'm starting to doubt your resolve!

733
01:18:59,523 --> 01:19:02,026
The way I see it,
it's time to terminate the mission.

734
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:03,944
No, I can do this.

735
01:19:04,069 --> 01:19:05,654
You already have.

736
01:19:06,655 --> 01:19:08,824
You give me good, usable intel.

737
01:19:08,949 --> 01:19:11,118
This Tree of Souls place.

738
01:19:11,577 --> 01:19:14,955
Yeah, I got them by the balls with that
when this turns into a shit fight,

739
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,790
which it will. Yeah.

740
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:19,710
Now it's time to come in.

741
01:19:21,212 --> 01:19:23,088
By the way,

742
01:19:23,631 --> 01:19:25,591
you gonna get your legs back.

743
01:19:26,509 --> 01:19:30,054
Yeah. I got your corporate approval.
It's a done deal.

744
01:19:30,179 --> 01:19:32,598
Gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

745
01:19:32,723 --> 01:19:34,475
I'm a man of my word.

746
01:19:37,394 --> 01:19:39,146
I gotta finish this.

747
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:42,983
There's one more thing.

748
01:19:43,692 --> 01:19:48,656
Ceremony. It's the final stage
of becoming a man.

749
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,285
lf I do it, I'm one of them.

750
01:19:54,787 --> 01:19:56,539
And they'll trust me.

751
01:20:00,209 --> 01:20:03,379
And I can negotiate
the terms of their relocation.

752
01:20:17,059 --> 01:20:19,520
Well, then,
you'd better get it done, Corporal.

753
01:20:36,954 --> 01:20:40,916
<i>The Na 'vi say
that every person is born twice.</i>

754
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:48,382
<i>The second time is when you earn
your place among The People forever.</i>

755
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:58,184
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>You are now a son of the Omaticaya.</i>

756
01:20:59,393 --> 01:21:02,646
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>You are part of The People.</i>

757
01:21:48,984 --> 01:21:50,945
Come. Come.

758
01:22:08,587 --> 01:22:11,298
This is a place for prayers to be heard.

759
01:22:12,925 --> 01:22:14,802
And sometimes answered.

760
01:22:22,685 --> 01:22:25,312
<i>We call these trees Utraya Mokri.</i>

761
01:22:26,355 --> 01:22:28,065
The Tree of Voices.

762
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:32,236
The voices of our ancestors.

763
01:22:47,293 --> 01:22:48,836
I can hear them.

764
01:22:53,841 --> 01:22:55,384
They live, Jake,

765
01:22:57,511 --> 01:22:58,846
within Eywa.

766
01:23:03,058 --> 01:23:04,894
You are Omaticaya now.

767
01:23:05,686 --> 01:23:08,731
You may make your bow
from the wood of Hometree.

768
01:23:14,403 --> 01:23:16,447
And you may choose a woman.

769
01:23:18,616 --> 01:23:20,534
We have many fine women.

770
01:23:21,785 --> 01:23:23,746
Ninat is the best singer.

771
01:23:26,665 --> 01:23:28,542
But I don't want Ninat.

772
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:34,798
Peyral is a good hunter.

773
01:23:36,509 --> 01:23:38,552
Yeah, she is a good hunter.

774
01:23:40,679 --> 01:23:42,389
I've already chosen.

775
01:23:45,935 --> 01:23:48,395
But this woman must also choose me.

776
01:23:52,441 --> 01:23:54,026
She already has.

777
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:26,559
I am with you now, Jake.

778
01:24:28,143 --> 01:24:29,979
<i>We are mated for life.</i>

779
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:38,362
<i>What the hell are you doing, Jake?</i>

780
01:25:08,851 --> 01:25:09,977
<i>Ma Jake!</i>

781
01:25:10,102 --> 01:25:11,312
Don't forget your phase integration.

782
01:25:11,437 --> 01:25:12,771
— Jake!
— No, no, the middle button.

783
01:25:12,897 --> 01:25:14,732
— You gotta eat something.
— Yeah, there you go.

784
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:28,162
Jake! Jake. Wake up! Jake, please!

785
01:25:28,829 --> 01:25:31,290
Don't make me force-feed a cripple.

786
01:25:32,458 --> 01:25:34,001
Grace, I don't want… Hey!

787
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:38,923
Jake!

788
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:48,974
Okay.

789
01:26:00,069 --> 01:26:02,071
Here. I'm done. Let's go.

790
01:26:02,196 --> 01:26:04,406
And when was the last time
you took a shower?

791
01:26:04,532 --> 01:26:06,534
— I don't need a shower.
— Jesus, Marine.

792
01:26:10,746 --> 01:26:11,956
Jake!

793
01:26:18,754 --> 01:26:23,717
Jake! Wake up! Jake! Wake up!

794
01:26:27,221 --> 01:26:28,514
Hey!

795
01:26:29,265 --> 01:26:31,642
Stop! Stop!

796
01:26:31,767 --> 01:26:34,520
— Jake!
— Go back, stop!

797
01:26:38,774 --> 01:26:40,067
Hey, boss.

798
01:26:40,568 --> 01:26:41,735
Hey!

799
01:26:44,321 --> 01:26:45,406
— What?
— I got a native

800
01:26:45,531 --> 01:26:48,409
doing the funky chicken here.
He's blocking my blade.

801
01:26:48,534 --> 01:26:51,620
Well, keep going. He'll move.

802
01:26:51,745 --> 01:26:54,957
These people have to learn
that we don't stop. Come on, go, go, go.

803
01:26:57,334 --> 01:26:59,503
Stop! Hey!

804
01:26:59,628 --> 01:27:01,922
Go! Go!

805
01:27:02,965 --> 01:27:04,341
There, see? He moved.

806
01:27:16,770 --> 01:27:18,439
Dude, dude. Whoa, dude! Dude, no!

807
01:27:19,398 --> 01:27:20,691
I'm blind.

808
01:27:32,578 --> 01:27:34,788
— Jake!
— Neytiri!

809
01:27:36,415 --> 01:27:38,042
Here, come on!

810
01:28:03,025 --> 01:28:05,528
Freeze it right there.

811
01:28:07,154 --> 01:28:09,573
Scale up. Enhance.

812
01:28:11,242 --> 01:28:12,743
Son of a bitch.

813
01:28:14,286 --> 01:28:15,704
Unbelievable.

814
01:28:16,831 --> 01:28:18,916
— Get me a pilot.
— Yes, sir.

815
01:28:25,714 --> 01:28:28,008
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Tsu'tey will lead the war party.</i>

816
01:28:34,557 --> 01:28:35,766
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Stop please!</i>

817
01:28:37,393 --> 01:28:39,353
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>This will only make it worse.</i>

818
01:28:39,562 --> 01:28:41,188
You do not speak here!

819
01:28:42,398 --> 01:28:44,233
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>We will strike them in the heart.</i>

820
01:28:51,991 --> 01:28:54,118
Tsu'tey! Don't do this.

821
01:28:57,288 --> 01:28:58,789
— You!
— Listen. Brother…

822
01:29:04,295 --> 01:29:07,423
— You mated with this woman?
— Oh, shit.

823
01:29:08,757 --> 01:29:10,676
Is this true?

824
01:29:12,261 --> 01:29:15,389
We are mated before Eywa. It is done.

825
01:29:16,807 --> 01:29:17,933
Brother, please.

826
01:29:18,058 --> 01:29:21,812
Do not attack the Sky People.
Many Omaticaya will die if you do.

827
01:29:21,937 --> 01:29:24,190
You are not my brother!

828
01:29:27,443 --> 01:29:29,153
And I am not your enemy!

829
01:29:30,821 --> 01:29:33,657
The enemy is out there,
and they are very powerful!

830
01:29:35,951 --> 01:29:37,703
Go! Go! Go!

831
01:29:40,956 --> 01:29:43,375
— I can talk to them.
— No more talk.

832
01:29:43,501 --> 01:29:44,835
Tsu'tey!

833
01:29:51,091 --> 01:29:53,969
I am Omaticaya. I am one of you.

834
01:29:54,803 --> 01:29:57,014
And I have the right to speak.

835
01:30:01,602 --> 01:30:03,521
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>I have something to say… </i>

836
01:30:05,898 --> 01:30:07,399
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… to all of you.</i>

837
01:30:11,403 --> 01:30:13,447
The words are like stones in my heart.

838
01:30:17,826 --> 01:30:19,745
Sir, I'm sorry. No, no, no! Hold on!

839
01:30:19,870 --> 01:30:22,081
You can't interrupt a link in progress!

840
01:30:23,290 --> 01:30:24,625
It's very dangerous!

841
01:30:27,253 --> 01:30:28,379
Grace!

842
01:30:29,672 --> 01:30:30,798
Oh, no.

843
01:30:31,048 --> 01:30:33,008
— Wait!
— Stay down, sir.

844
01:30:34,552 --> 01:30:36,804
Okay. Look…

845
01:30:37,888 --> 01:30:39,181
I was sent here to…

846
01:30:42,852 --> 01:30:44,228
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>You see?</i>

847
01:30:44,436 --> 01:30:47,022
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>It is a demon in a false body.</i>

848
01:31:06,792 --> 01:31:10,171
— Are you out of your goddamn mind?
— You crossed the line.

849
01:31:13,632 --> 01:31:15,759
Wheel this meat out of here.

850
01:31:17,553 --> 01:31:20,055
Jake! What the hell is going on here?

851
01:31:23,309 --> 01:31:25,060
You let me down, son.

852
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:28,314
So, what,

853
01:31:29,857 --> 01:31:31,817
you find yourself some local tail

854
01:31:31,942 --> 01:31:35,070
and you just completely forget
what team you're playing for?

855
01:31:35,196 --> 01:31:37,698
Parker, there is time
to salvage the situation.

856
01:31:37,823 --> 01:31:40,284
— Parker…
— Shut your pie hole!

857
01:31:40,409 --> 01:31:44,580
Or what, Ranger Rick?
You gonna shoot me?

858
01:31:44,705 --> 01:31:47,416
— I could do that.
— You need to muzzle your dog.

859
01:31:47,541 --> 01:31:50,252
Yeah, can we just take this down
a couple of notches, please?

860
01:31:50,377 --> 01:31:52,796
You say you want to
keep your people alive?

861
01:31:52,922 --> 01:31:54,924
You start by listening to her.

862
01:31:55,049 --> 01:31:57,259
Those trees were sacred to the Omaticaya

863
01:31:57,384 --> 01:31:59,136
— in a way you can't imagine.
— You know what?

864
01:31:59,261 --> 01:32:01,514
You throw a stick in the air around here,

865
01:32:01,639 --> 01:32:04,600
it's gonna land on some sacred fern,

866
01:32:04,725 --> 01:32:06,018
— for Christ's sake!
— I'm not talking

867
01:32:06,143 --> 01:32:10,523
about some kind of pagan voodoo here.
I'm talking about something real,

868
01:32:10,648 --> 01:32:13,275
something measurable
in the biology of the forest.

869
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:14,818
Which is what, exactly?

870
01:32:15,903 --> 01:32:17,196
What we think we know

871
01:32:17,321 --> 01:32:20,658
is that there is some kind of
electrochemical communication

872
01:32:20,783 --> 01:32:25,120
between the roots of the trees,
like the synapses between neurons.

873
01:32:25,246 --> 01:32:29,792
And each tree has ten-to-the-fourth
connections to the trees around it.

874
01:32:29,917 --> 01:32:33,087
And there are ten-to-the-twelfth trees
on Pandora.

875
01:32:34,004 --> 01:32:36,215
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

876
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:38,676
It's more connections
than the human brain.

877
01:32:39,885 --> 01:32:42,388
Get it? It's a network.

878
01:32:42,513 --> 01:32:45,474
It's a global network,
and the Na'vi can access it.

879
01:32:45,599 --> 01:32:49,061
They can upload and download data.
Memories.

880
01:32:49,186 --> 01:32:51,856
At sites like the one you just destroyed.

881
01:32:52,523 --> 01:32:53,524
Yes!

882
01:32:54,775 --> 01:32:58,863
What the hell have you people
been smoking out there?

883
01:32:59,530 --> 01:33:01,615
They're just goddamn trees!

884
01:33:03,367 --> 01:33:06,078
— You need to wake up, Parker.
— No. You need to wake up.

885
01:33:06,203 --> 01:33:10,666
The wealth of this world isn't
in the ground. It's all around us.

886
01:33:10,791 --> 01:33:14,461
The Na'vi know that,
and they are fighting to defend it.

887
01:33:14,587 --> 01:33:18,841
lf you want to share this world with them,
you need to understand them.

888
01:33:18,966 --> 01:33:23,596
I'd say we understand them just fine,
thanks to Jake here.

889
01:33:25,389 --> 01:33:27,808
Hey, Doc, come take a look.

890
01:33:27,933 --> 01:33:30,102
<i>They're not gonna give up their home.</i>

891
01:33:31,937 --> 01:33:33,564
<i>They're not gonna make a deal.</i>

892
01:33:34,648 --> 01:33:36,901
<i>For what? Lite beer?</i>

893
01:33:37,568 --> 01:33:39,028
<i>And blue jeans?</i>

894
01:33:42,323 --> 01:33:45,201
<i>There's nothing that we have
that they want.</i>

895
01:33:47,119 --> 01:33:50,122
<i>Everything they sent me out here to do
is a waste of time.</i>

896
01:33:55,085 --> 01:33:56,962
<i>They're never gonna leave Hometree.</i>

897
01:33:59,423 --> 01:34:05,387
So, since a deal can't be made,
I guess things get real simple.

898
01:34:05,596 --> 01:34:10,059
Jake, thanks. I'm getting all emotional.

899
01:34:10,184 --> 01:34:12,728
I might just give you a big wet kiss.

900
01:34:19,777 --> 01:34:23,113
I'll do it with minimal casualties
to the indigenous.

901
01:34:24,073 --> 01:34:26,534
I'll drive them out with gas first.

902
01:34:27,785 --> 01:34:29,370
It'll be humane.

903
01:34:30,996 --> 01:34:32,414
More or less.

904
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:36,001
All right, let's pull the trigger.

905
01:34:39,630 --> 01:34:41,549
— Come on, people.
— Oh, man.

906
01:34:41,674 --> 01:34:43,342
Let's pack it up, let's go.

907
01:34:43,467 --> 01:34:45,261
This is how it's done.

908
01:34:48,305 --> 01:34:51,600
When people are sitting
on shit that you want,

909
01:34:51,725 --> 01:34:55,729
you make them your enemy.
Then you're justified in taking it.

910
01:34:55,855 --> 01:34:59,275
Quaritch is rolling the gunships.
He's gonna hit Hometree.

911
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:00,401
My God.

912
01:35:06,699 --> 01:35:10,870
— Dr. Augustine! You cannot be up here!
— Back off!

913
01:35:10,995 --> 01:35:14,665
Parker. Wait. Stop.
These are people you're about to…

914
01:35:14,790 --> 01:35:15,833
— No. No, no, no, no.
— I said back off!

915
01:35:15,958 --> 01:35:19,336
They're fly-bitten savages
that live in a tree!

916
01:35:19,461 --> 01:35:21,130
All right? Look around!

917
01:35:21,255 --> 01:35:24,925
I don't know about you,
but I see a lot of trees! They can move!

918
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:26,468
— Can you guys just please…
— Yes, sir.

919
01:35:26,594 --> 01:35:29,054
There are families in there.
There are children. Babies.

920
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:30,431
Are you gonna kill children?

921
01:35:30,556 --> 01:35:34,435
You don't want that kind of blood
on your hands. Believe me.

922
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,896
Just let me try to talk them out.

923
01:35:37,730 --> 01:35:39,190
They trust me.

924
01:35:42,526 --> 01:35:44,904
Calibrate fast. We're going in, right now.

925
01:35:45,029 --> 01:35:46,906
Calibrating three and four.

926
01:35:47,031 --> 01:35:49,950
— Run sequence.
— lnitiating. Thirty seconds.

927
01:35:54,371 --> 01:35:56,040
Listen to me. You've got one hour.

928
01:35:56,165 --> 01:35:58,709
Unless you want your girlfriend in there
when the ax comes down,

929
01:35:58,834 --> 01:36:01,420
you get them to evacuate. One hour.

930
01:36:07,343 --> 01:36:08,552
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Father</i>

931
01:36:08,761 --> 01:36:09,762
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Mother</i>

932
01:36:09,929 --> 01:36:13,098
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Eytukan, I have something to say.</i>

933
01:36:13,265 --> 01:36:14,517
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Listen !</i>

934
01:36:15,643 --> 01:36:17,102
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Speak, Jakesully.</i>

935
01:36:18,479 --> 01:36:21,524
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>A great evil is upon us… </i>

936
01:36:21,899 --> 01:36:23,651
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>The Sky People are coming… </i>

937
01:36:23,984 --> 01:36:26,403
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… to destroy Hometree</i>

938
01:36:28,906 --> 01:36:30,282
Look, tell them
they're gonna be here soon.

939
01:36:32,910 --> 01:36:35,621
You have to leave, or you're gonna die.

940
01:36:35,746 --> 01:36:37,665
Are you certain of this?

941
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:45,130
Look, they sent me here to learn your ways

942
01:36:46,382 --> 01:36:49,593
so one day I could bring this message
and that you would believe it.

943
01:36:52,179 --> 01:36:55,766
What are you saying, Jake?
You knew this would happen?

944
01:36:59,019 --> 01:37:00,479
Yes.

945
01:37:00,604 --> 01:37:02,982
Look, at first it was just orders,

946
01:37:04,525 --> 01:37:06,819
and then everything changed.

947
01:37:06,944 --> 01:37:08,696
Okay? I fell in love.

948
01:37:09,363 --> 01:37:14,618
I fell in love with the forest
and with the Omaticaya people.

949
01:37:15,828 --> 01:37:17,246
And with you.

950
01:37:18,289 --> 01:37:20,082
— I trusted you.
— With you. With you.

951
01:37:20,207 --> 01:37:23,002
— I trusted you!
— Trust me now, please.

952
01:37:30,426 --> 01:37:32,803
You will never be one of The People!

953
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,680
— I shouldn't have…
— We tried to stop them !

954
01:37:34,805 --> 01:37:36,765
Neytiri, please! Please.

955
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:42,813
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Bind them .</i>

956
01:37:44,607 --> 01:37:45,649
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Leave now !</i>

957
01:37:45,816 --> 01:37:49,111
You have to go. They're coming!

958
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,169
<i>Time on target, one mike.</i>

959
01:38:05,294 --> 01:38:07,213
<i>Copy. We have a visual.</i>

960
01:38:07,338 --> 01:38:10,299
<i>Roger that. Stay on heading 030.</i>

961
01:38:10,424 --> 01:38:11,759
<i>Roger, 030.</i>

962
01:38:25,564 --> 01:38:27,566
— Run to the forest!
— They're coming!

963
01:38:29,235 --> 01:38:33,030
— They will destroy this place.
— Neytiri, you must go now!

964
01:38:36,867 --> 01:38:39,119
Run to the forest! Run!

965
01:38:41,539 --> 01:38:42,832
Run! Run!

966
01:38:42,998 --> 01:38:46,544
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Have no fear .</i>

967
01:39:03,394 --> 01:39:07,064
No! God damn it, run!

968
01:39:07,398 --> 01:39:08,774
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Take the ikran… .</i>

969
01:39:08,941 --> 01:39:10,401
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… attack from above.</i>

970
01:39:14,738 --> 01:39:16,866
That is one big damn tree.

971
01:39:24,415 --> 01:39:28,586
Well, well, well.
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

972
01:39:30,588 --> 01:39:32,673
All right, people, let's get this done!

973
01:39:32,798 --> 01:39:35,593
I want every gas round you got
right in the front door.

974
01:39:35,718 --> 01:39:37,720
Roger. CS .40's going hot.

975
01:39:38,095 --> 01:39:39,263
— Fire.
— Firing.

976
01:39:50,774 --> 01:39:52,735
Bingo. Mighty good shooting, ace.

977
01:40:00,743 --> 01:40:02,328
Sir, they've opened fire.

978
01:40:04,288 --> 01:40:05,956
You've got to be kidding me!

979
01:40:18,552 --> 01:40:21,055
These dumb bastards
ain't getting the message.

980
01:40:21,180 --> 01:40:22,806
All right, let's turn up the heat.

981
01:40:22,932 --> 01:40:25,809
— Switch incendiaries!
— Switching incendiaries.

982
01:40:25,935 --> 01:40:26,977
<i>Fire.</i>

983
01:40:30,314 --> 01:40:31,357
No!

984
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:46,330
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Get everyone to the forest.</i>

985
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:51,961
And that's how you scatter the roaches.

986
01:40:55,714 --> 01:40:56,924
Neytiri!

987
01:41:05,641 --> 01:41:08,644
We gotta move!
He's gonna blow the columns!

988
01:41:08,769 --> 01:41:09,979
My God!

989
01:41:28,581 --> 01:41:31,917
— Mo'at! No!
— lf you are one of us,

990
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:34,795
help us.

991
01:41:42,553 --> 01:41:44,513
All call signs, switch missiles.

992
01:41:44,722 --> 01:41:47,141
<i>Give me HE's
at the base of the west columns.</i>

993
01:41:49,101 --> 01:41:50,352
This way!

994
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:53,355
<i>Rider section, switch missiles.</i>

995
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:55,357
<i>— One's good.
— Two's rocks up.</i>

996
01:41:55,482 --> 01:41:58,027
<i>— Three's up.
— Yeah, baby, get some!</i>

997
01:41:58,569 --> 01:42:00,821
<i>Charlie Oscar, Gunrunner standing by.</i>

998
01:42:00,946 --> 01:42:02,281
<i>— Bring it down.
— Cleared hot.</i>

999
01:42:09,413 --> 01:42:10,915
Come on, Grace, move!

1000
01:42:13,584 --> 01:42:15,169
Down! Head down!

1001
01:42:17,755 --> 01:42:19,965
Come on, come on! Down!

1002
01:42:24,762 --> 01:42:26,722
<i>— Solid hits.
— Solid rocks on target.</i>

1003
01:42:26,847 --> 01:42:28,015
Screw this.

1004
01:42:29,266 --> 01:42:31,227
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1005
01:42:31,352 --> 01:42:33,103
I didn't sign up for this shit!

1006

<i>Repeat. Ripple fire.</i>

No, no, get back! Back!

Come on! Come on, move! Move!

1010
01:45:11,971 --> 01:45:15,558
That's good work, people.
First round's on me tonight.

1011
01:45:16,267 --> 01:45:17,518
Let's boogie.

1012
01:45:17,935 --> 01:45:20,312
<i>Dragon coming left, heading home.</i>

1013
01:45:20,813 --> 01:45:22,731
<i>Gunrunner coming left.</i>

1014
01:45:22,857 --> 01:45:25,317
<i>— Thunder copies.
— Rider section copies.</i>

1015
01:45:33,033 --> 01:45:34,034
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Father</i>

1016
01:45:50,009 --> 01:45:51,177
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Daughter… </i>

1017
01:45:52,428 --> 01:45:55,639
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>take… my… bow.</i>

1018
01:45:59,643 --> 01:46:04,064
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Protect The People.</i>

1019
01:46:12,490 --> 01:46:13,657
Neytiri!

1020
01:46:23,751 --> 01:46:27,463
— I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
— Get away.

1021
01:46:28,172 --> 01:46:29,381
Get away!

1022
01:46:30,508 --> 01:46:32,218
Get away from here!

1023
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:35,304
Never come back!

1024
01:46:53,030 --> 01:46:54,114
Pull the plug.

1025
01:46:55,115 --> 01:46:57,701
— No, you can't do that!
— You can't do that!

1026
01:46:57,827 --> 01:46:59,745
— Calm down! Calm down!
— No! Please!

1027
01:47:15,970 --> 01:47:18,514
<i>I was a warrior
who dreamed he could bring peace.</i>

1028
01:47:19,932 --> 01:47:23,811
<i>Sooner or later, though,
you always have to wake up.</i>

1029
01:47:26,647 --> 01:47:28,065
Let's go!

1030
01:47:35,948 --> 01:47:37,533
Put him down!

1031
01:47:40,911 --> 01:47:43,622
You murderer!

1032
01:48:30,294 --> 01:48:32,379
What's going on, brother?
Long time no see.

1033
01:48:32,505 --> 01:48:33,506
Hey.

1034
01:48:34,924 --> 01:48:37,593
Personally, I don't feel these
tree-hugging traitors deserve steak.

1035
01:48:37,718 --> 01:48:41,013
They get steak? That's bullshit.
Let me see that.

1036
01:48:42,097 --> 01:48:44,600
Yeah. You know what that is. Down.

1037
01:48:44,725 --> 01:48:47,186
— Trudy!
— All the way down.

1038
01:48:50,648 --> 01:48:51,815
Max!

1039
01:49:01,909 --> 01:49:04,411
Trudy, fire up the ship! Go!

1040
01:49:04,995 --> 01:49:06,080
Here.

1041
01:49:18,175 --> 01:49:20,594
— Clear. Come on.
— Here you go.

1042
01:49:36,193 --> 01:49:40,072
Max, stay here.
I need someone on the inside I can trust.

1043
01:49:40,197 --> 01:49:41,407
Okay. Go.

1044
01:49:55,254 --> 01:49:56,380
Clear.

1045
01:49:58,382 --> 01:49:59,592
Come on, baby.

1046
01:49:59,717 --> 01:50:02,469
Colonel? Sir? I got a situation here.

1047
01:50:06,098 --> 01:50:09,101
It's Samson 1-6.
Unauthorized engine start.

1048
01:50:12,188 --> 01:50:13,439
Three!

1049
01:50:16,317 --> 01:50:17,484
Come on!

1050
01:50:19,528 --> 01:50:20,821
Mask on!

1051
01:50:23,407 --> 01:50:25,201
Gas, gas, gas!

1052
01:50:26,869 --> 01:50:28,871
I'm taking fire! Let's go!

1053
01:50:31,373 --> 01:50:34,502
Grab my hand!
Come on, we're in. Let's go!

1054
01:50:35,503 --> 01:50:37,296
Come on, let's go! Let's go, go!

1055
01:50:49,975 --> 01:50:51,268
Colonel!

1056
01:50:58,067 --> 01:51:01,529
— Yeah! Yeah!
— All right! Yes!

1057
01:51:04,782 --> 01:51:07,409
— Crap.
— Everybody all right back there?

1058
01:51:07,535 --> 01:51:08,994
Oh, yeah, baby!

1059
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:10,955
— Norm, you good?
— Yeah!

1060
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:14,166
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

1061
01:51:14,458 --> 01:51:16,210
— Grace is hit!
— What?

1062
01:51:17,419 --> 01:51:18,963
— Get the trauma kit.
— Trauma kit!

1063
01:51:19,088 --> 01:51:22,550
— Keep the pressure on, Grace.
— Trauma kit's forward, on the bulkhead.

1064
01:51:22,675 --> 01:51:27,096
— Hang on, Grace.
— Doesn't matter. It's fine.

1065
01:51:30,474 --> 01:51:32,893
<i>— You're good to go.
— Take it up!</i>

1066
01:51:34,103 --> 01:51:35,896
<i>Hold on. I'm pulling pitch.</i>

1067
01:51:40,359 --> 01:51:41,777
You're clear!

1068
01:51:49,743 --> 01:51:52,454
Just keep going north.
Get us deep in the mountains.

1069
01:51:52,580 --> 01:51:53,956
<i>Copy that.</i>

1070
01:52:00,963 --> 01:52:04,258
<i>— Norm, you all good up there?
— Yep! Still here.</i>

1071
01:52:06,135 --> 01:52:10,764
Well, at least they can't track us up here.
Not this far into the Vortex.

1072
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:12,933
It's strongest at the Tree of Souls, right?

1073
01:52:13,058 --> 01:52:14,476
<i>Yeah.</i>

1074
01:52:14,602 --> 01:52:16,520
Good. 'Cause that's where we're going.

1075
01:52:25,404 --> 01:52:26,530
Ouch.

1076
01:52:29,992 --> 01:52:31,368
You big baby.

1077
01:52:32,745 --> 01:52:34,163
We're moving.

1078
01:52:34,747 --> 01:52:36,790
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

1079
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:39,877
I'm a scientist, remember?

1080
01:52:40,836 --> 01:52:43,255
I don't believe in fairy tales.

1081
01:52:44,131 --> 01:52:46,008
The People can help you.

1082
01:52:46,509 --> 01:52:47,801
I know it.

1083
01:52:49,803 --> 01:52:51,639
Why would they help us?

1084
01:53:07,696 --> 01:53:10,783
<i>The People say Eywa will provide.</i>

1085
01:53:12,743 --> 01:53:15,412
<i>With no home, no hope,</i>

1086
01:53:16,539 --> 01:53:18,666
<i>there was only one place they could go.</i>

1087
01:53:33,097 --> 01:53:34,265
Link's running.

1088
01:53:35,015 --> 01:53:37,977
— What's the plan here, Jake?
— There's no plan.

1089
01:53:39,061 --> 01:53:43,691
<i>Tsu'tey is Olo'eyktan now.
He's not gonna let you near that place.</i>

1090
01:53:44,733 --> 01:53:46,068
I gotta try.

1091
01:53:48,863 --> 01:53:50,156
Launching.

1092
01:54:11,677 --> 01:54:12,887
<i>Outcast.</i>

1093
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:14,889
<i>Betrayer.</i>

1094
01:54:16,015 --> 01:54:17,141
<i>Alien.</i>

1095
01:54:18,726 --> 01:54:21,395
<i>I was in the place the eye does not see.</i>

1096
01:54:32,615 --> 01:54:36,452
<i>I needed their help, and they needed mine.</i>

1097
01:54:37,411 --> 01:54:39,371
<i>But to ever face them again,</i>

1098
01:54:39,497 --> 01:54:41,916
<i>I was gonna have to take it
to a whole new level.</i>

1099
01:54:50,508 --> 01:54:53,802
<i>Sometimes your whole life boils down
to one insane move.</i>

1100
01:54:56,597 --> 01:54:58,933
There's something we gotta do.

1101
01:54:59,058 --> 01:55:00,726
You're not gonna like it.

1102
01:55:10,778 --> 01:55:14,573
<i>The way I had it figured,
Toruk is the baddest cat in the sky.</i>

1103
01:55:14,698 --> 01:55:16,283
<i>Nothing attacks him.</i>

1104
01:55:16,826 --> 01:55:18,118
Easy, boy.

1105
01:55:18,619 --> 01:55:20,412
<i>So why would he ever look up?</i>

1106
01:55:21,580 --> 01:55:23,165
<i>But that was just a theory.</i>

1107
01:56:33,903 --> 01:56:35,488
<i>Toruk Macto?</i>

1108
01:57:15,319 --> 01:57:16,779
I See you.

1109
01:57:19,907 --> 01:57:21,200
I See you.

1110
01:57:29,542 --> 01:57:31,210
I was afraid, Jake.

1111
01:57:32,670 --> 01:57:34,129
For my people.

1112
01:57:37,216 --> 01:57:38,801
I'm not anymore.

1113
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:50,563
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo… </i>

1114
01:57:51,313 --> 01:57:53,190
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… I stand before you… </i>

1115
01:57:54,316 --> 01:57:57,361
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… ready to serve the Omaticaya people.</i>

1116
01:58:00,030 --> 01:58:04,243
<i>You are Olo'eyktan,
and you are a great warrior.</i>

1117
01:58:05,452 --> 01:58:07,580
I can't do this without you.

1118
01:58:14,670 --> 01:58:16,046
<i>Toruk Macto,</i>

1119
01:58:23,929 --> 01:58:25,639
I will fly with you.

1120
01:58:28,976 --> 01:58:30,686
My friend is dying.

1121
01:58:33,105 --> 01:58:34,607
Grace is dying.

1122
01:58:36,650 --> 01:58:38,486
I beg the help of Eywa.

1123
01:58:50,414 --> 01:58:52,374
Look where we are, Grace.

1124
01:58:59,131 --> 01:59:01,467
I need to take some samples.

1125
01:59:24,949 --> 01:59:28,994
The Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is

1126
01:59:30,246 --> 01:59:31,664
in this body.

1127
01:59:34,250 --> 01:59:35,876
Is that possible?

1128
01:59:36,001 --> 01:59:40,464
She must pass through the eye of Eywa
and return.

1129
01:59:41,757 --> 01:59:43,259
But, Jakesully,

1130
01:59:44,301 --> 01:59:45,886
she is very weak.

1131
01:59:47,388 --> 01:59:50,182
Hang on, Grace. They're gonna fix you up.

1132
01:59:53,477 --> 01:59:56,021
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Hear us please, All Mother.</i>

1133
01:59:56,647 --> 01:59:58,858
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Eywa, help her.</i>

1134
01:59:59,650 --> 02:00:01,777
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>Take this spirit into you… </i>

1135
02:00:05,447 --> 02:00:07,533
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… and breathe her back to us.</i>

1136
02:00:11,453 --> 02:00:13,038
<font color=»#f0cf00»>Let her walk among us…

1137
02:00:15,624 --> 02:00:17,501
<i><font color=»#f0cf00»>… as one of The People.</i>

1138
02:00:46,447 --> 02:00:47,490
Jake.

1139
02:00:49,950 --> 02:00:51,076
Grace.

1140
02:00:53,245 --> 02:00:54,914
I'm with her, Jake.

1141
02:00:56,957 --> 02:00:58,292
She's real!

1142
02:01:01,378 --> 02:01:04,507
Grace? Grace, please. Grace!

1143
02:01:05,716 --> 02:01:07,301
What's happening?

1144
02:01:08,302 --> 02:01:09,929
What's happening?

1145
02:01:14,308 --> 02:01:15,434
Grace!

1146
02:01:16,185 --> 02:01:17,311
Grace!

1147
02:01:19,438 --> 02:01:21,023
What's happening?

1148
02:01:27,321 --> 02:01:28,697
Did it work?

1149
02:01:34,411 --> 02:01:38,457
Her wounds were too great.
It was not enough time.

1150
02:01:40,167 --> 02:01:41,877
She is with Eywa now.

1151
02:02:15,703 --> 02:02:18,330
With your permission, I will speak now.

1152
02:02:20,749 --> 02:02:23,169
You would honor me by translating.

1153
02:02:30,301 --> 02:02:32,469
The Sky People have sent us a message

1154
02:02:35,890 --> 02:02:38,267
that they can take whatever they want

1155
02:02:40,102 --> 02:02:41,854
and no one can stop them.

1156
02:02:45,483 --> 02:02:47,234
Well, we will send them a message.

1157
02:02:49,904 --> 02:02:52,198
You ride out as fast
as the wind can carry you.

1158
02:02:55,534 --> 02:02:57,870
You tell the other clans to come.

1159
02:03:01,040 --> 02:03:03,501
<i>You tell them Toruk Macto calls to them.</i>

1160
02:03:05,753 --> 02:03:08,506
And you fly now with me!

1161
02:03:09,590 --> 02:03:12,051
My brothers! Sisters!

1162
02:03:13,177 --> 02:03:15,221
And we will show the Sky People

1163
02:03:16,263 --> 02:03:18,098
that they cannot take whatever they want,

1164
02:03:19,642 --> 02:03:21,060
and that this,

1165
02:03:21,810 --> 02:03:22,811
this is our land!

1166
02:03:29,944 --> 02:03:31,362
Yah!

1167
02:03:46,502 --> 02:03:47,878
Yah!

1168
02:04:17,324 --> 02:04:18,659
Yah!

1169
02:04:36,218 --> 02:04:37,678
<i>We rode out to the four winds.</i>

1170
02:04:40,472 --> 02:04:42,850
<i>To the horse clans of the plain.</i>

1171
02:04:45,853 --> 02:04:46,854
Back to the stars!

1172
02:04:46,979 --> 02:04:49,148
<i>To the ikran people of the Eastern Sea.</i>

1173
02:04:49,273 --> 02:04:50,483
For our children's children!

1174
02:04:50,608 --> 02:04:53,152
<i>When Toruk Macto called them, they came.</i>

1175
02:04:57,031 --> 02:04:58,365
Yah!

1176
02:05:34,568 --> 02:05:37,029
Everyone on this base, every one of you,

1177
02:05:37,154 --> 02:05:38,948
is fighting for survival.

1178
02:05:39,073 --> 02:05:40,533
That's a fact!

1179
02:05:41,408 --> 02:05:45,120
There's an aboriginal horde out there
massing for an attack.

1180
02:05:46,247 --> 02:05:50,084
Now, these orbital images tell me

1181
02:05:50,543 --> 02:05:53,712
that the hostiles' numbers
have gone from a few hundred

1182
02:05:53,838 --> 02:05:56,340
to well over 2,000 in one day.

1183
02:05:56,924 --> 02:05:58,884
And more are pouring in.

1184
02:06:01,387 --> 02:06:04,765
ln a week's time,
there could be 20,000 of them.

1185
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:07,184
At that point,
they will overrun our perimeter.

1186
02:06:07,309 --> 02:06:09,478
Well, that's not gonna happen!

1187
02:06:11,105 --> 02:06:14,692
Our only security lies
in pre-emptive attack.

1188
02:06:14,817 --> 02:06:17,153
We will fight terror with terror.

1189
02:06:21,490 --> 02:06:25,619
Now, the hostiles believe
that this mountain stronghold of theirs

1190
02:06:25,744 --> 02:06:28,080
is protected by their…

1191
02:06:28,205 --> 02:06:29,540
Their deity.

1192
02:06:30,875 --> 02:06:32,918
And when we destroy it,

1193
02:06:33,043 --> 02:06:35,337
we will blast a crater
in their racial memory so deep

1194
02:06:35,462 --> 02:06:38,924
that they won't come
within 1,000 klicks of this place ever again.

1195
02:06:39,049 --> 02:06:41,719
And that, too, is a fact.

1196
02:06:42,469 --> 02:06:44,180
Yeah! Yeah.

1197
02:06:54,690 --> 02:06:58,611
<i>Jake, it's crazy here. It's full mobilization.
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.</i>

1198
02:06:58,736 --> 02:07:00,946
<i>They've got these huge pallets
of mine explosives.</i>

1199
02:07:01,071 --> 02:07:03,949
<i>It's for some kind
of shock-and-awe campaign.</i>

1200
02:07:04,074 --> 02:07:05,951
Fricking daisy cutters!

1201
02:07:07,495 --> 02:07:10,289
<i>Quaritch has taken over.
He's rolling, and there's no stopping him.</i>

1202
02:07:10,414 --> 02:07:12,458
<i>— When?
— 0600 tomorrow.</i>

1203
02:07:12,583 --> 02:07:14,418
<i>— Max! Max!
— I gotta go.</i>

1204
02:07:16,337 --> 02:07:17,796
We're screwed!

1205
02:07:19,298 --> 02:07:21,467
And I was hoping
for some sort of tactical plan

1206
02:07:21,592 --> 02:07:23,761
that didn't involve martyrdom.

1207
02:07:25,262 --> 02:07:28,599
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

1208
02:07:31,644 --> 02:07:33,646
I have 15 clans out there.

1209
02:07:34,355 --> 02:07:36,440
That's over 2,000 warriors.

1210
02:07:37,983 --> 02:07:42,404
Now, we know these mountains.
We fly them. You fly them. They don't.

1211
02:07:43,489 --> 02:07:47,493
Their instruments won't work up here.
Missile tracking won't work.

1212
02:07:48,035 --> 02:07:49,495
They'll have to fire a line of sight.

1213
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:53,833
lf they bring the fight to us,
then we have the home-field advantage.

1214
02:07:55,751 --> 02:07:59,171
You know he's gonna commit that bomber
straight to the Tree of Souls.

1215
02:07:59,296 --> 02:08:00,464
Yeah, I know.

1216
02:08:00,589 --> 02:08:03,050
lf they get to the Tree of Souls, it's over.

1217
02:08:03,175 --> 02:08:06,345
That's their direct line to Eywa,
their ancestors.

1218
02:08:07,179 --> 02:08:09,139
It'll destroy them.

1219
02:08:09,265 --> 02:08:11,642
Then I guess we'd better stop him.

1220
02:08:26,740 --> 02:08:29,702
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

1221
02:08:32,163 --> 02:08:36,876
But if you're there,
I need to give you a heads-up.

1222
02:08:39,461 --> 02:08:43,841
lf Grace is with you,
look into her memories.

1223
02:08:45,134 --> 02:08:47,219
See the world we come from.

1224
02:08:48,345 --> 02:08:50,222
There's no green there.

1225
02:08:51,640 --> 02:08:53,601
They killed their Mother.

1226
02:08:54,435 --> 02:08:56,896
And they're gonna do the same here.

1227
02:08:58,564 --> 02:09:01,108
More Sky People are gonna come.

1228
02:09:01,233 --> 02:09:04,236
They're gonna come
like a rain that never ends.

1229
02:09:05,571 --> 02:09:07,281
Unless we stop them.

1230
02:09:09,909 --> 02:09:12,953
Look, you chose me for something.

1231
02:09:14,455 --> 02:09:16,290
I will stand and fight.

1232
02:09:17,374 --> 02:09:18,918
You know I will.

1233
02:09:21,462 --> 02:09:23,672
But I need a little help here.

1234
02:09:29,845 --> 02:09:32,848
Our Great Mother
does not take sides, Jake.

1235
02:09:34,683 --> 02:09:38,103
She protects only the balance of life.

1236
02:09:49,949 --> 02:09:51,617
It was worth a try.

1237
02:10:22,356 --> 02:10:24,316
Yeah! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

1238
02:10:24,441 --> 02:10:27,736
Yeah! Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about, man!

1239
02:10:39,874 --> 02:10:43,210
<i>This is Group Leader.
We are entering the Flux Vortex.</i>

1240
02:10:43,627 --> 02:10:47,173
<i>— Switch to manual flight mode.
— Copy. Manual flight mode.</i>

1241
02:11:22,124 --> 02:11:23,959
This is Papa Dragon.

1242
02:11:24,084 --> 02:11:27,129
I want this mission high and tight.
I want to be home for dinner.

1243
02:11:34,678 --> 02:11:38,390
<i>— Suit Team, go.
— All right, ladies, let's bring the pain!</i>

1244
02:11:48,984 --> 02:11:50,569
Move, move, move!

1245
02:11:56,242 --> 02:11:57,993
<i>Bravo 1-1, move left.</i>

1246
02:11:58,577 --> 02:12:01,956
<i>Bravo 1-1 moving left. Watch flank.</i>

1247
02:12:04,333 --> 02:12:07,878
<i>— Watch formation. Keep moving.
— Roger that.</i>

1248
02:12:08,003 --> 02:12:10,339
<i>Charlie 2-1, watch your spacing.</i>

1249
02:12:10,464 --> 02:12:11,757
<i>Copy that. Over.</i>

1250
02:12:11,882 --> 02:12:16,512
Eyes up. Check that overhead.
And watch those thermal scans.

1251
02:12:17,137 --> 02:12:20,432
<i>All call signs, Papa has lead,
pushing to target.</i>

1252
02:12:20,558 --> 02:12:22,935
<i>Escorts, stay close on my shuttle.</i>

1253
02:12:28,065 --> 02:12:30,568
We are gonna lose some paint in here.

1254
02:12:31,569 --> 02:12:34,155
<i>Gun crews, keep your head on a swivel.</i>

1255
02:12:34,321 --> 02:12:37,199
<i>Make no mistake, people,
they're out there.</i>

1256
02:12:38,826 --> 02:12:42,037
All right, people, target in sight.
Range, four klicks.

1257
02:12:42,163 --> 02:12:44,331
Valkyrie 1-6, get your payload ready.

1258
02:12:44,498 --> 02:12:46,959
— Copy. Prepare to offload.
— Staff Sergeant, stage the weapon.

1259
02:12:47,793 --> 02:12:49,962
Roll it to the ramp! Let's go!

1260
02:12:52,256 --> 02:12:53,299
Hold!

1261
02:13:01,348 --> 02:13:03,350
<i>Charlie 2-1, got big movement.</i>

1262
02:13:03,475 --> 02:13:04,852
<i>— Hold position.
— Hold up, hold up.</i>

1263
02:13:04,977 --> 02:13:09,106
<i>— We got movement out there, 500 meters.
— Charlie 2-1, hold position.</i>

1264
02:13:15,237 --> 02:13:18,157
Sir, ground has movement!
Fast approaching.

1265
02:13:18,282 --> 02:13:20,784
<i>— Charlie Oscar, Rider section.
— Firing line!</i>

1266
02:13:21,202 --> 02:13:23,871
<i>Targets closing. Range, 400 meters.</i>

1267
02:13:24,622 --> 02:13:27,333
— Can't you clean it up?
— No, sir. It's the Flux.

1268
02:13:55,653 --> 02:13:58,280
Brother, I'm gonna punch a hole.
You follow me through.

1269
02:14:40,072 --> 02:14:42,783
All aircraft, weapons free! Weapons free!

1270
02:14:43,951 --> 02:14:45,119
Break right. Come around.

1271
02:14:48,706 --> 02:14:50,166
Light them up!

1272
02:14:57,840 --> 02:15:00,009
Break formation, engage all hostiles.

1273
02:15:07,308 --> 02:15:09,143
Yeah! Get some!

1274
02:15:48,182 --> 02:15:49,975
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1275
02:16:00,861 --> 02:16:02,613
Jake! Jake! You copy?

1276
02:16:03,322 --> 02:16:05,991
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

1277
02:16:06,116 --> 02:16:07,117
Copy. Get out of there.

1278
02:16:12,206 --> 02:16:13,582
That's him. Get after him !

1279
02:16:30,558 --> 02:16:32,017
Take him out!

1280
02:16:40,359 --> 02:16:41,777
Light her up!

1281
02:16:50,828 --> 02:16:52,204
Right there!

1282
02:16:52,371 --> 02:16:54,582
You're not the only one with a gun, bitch.

1283
02:16:54,874 --> 02:16:56,500
— Keep her in your sights.
— Purging. Feeding the leak.

1284
02:16:56,625 --> 02:16:57,626
Arming all pods.

1285
02:17:03,382 --> 02:17:04,425
That's it!

1286
02:17:35,122 --> 02:17:36,207
Seze!

1287
02:18:40,187 --> 02:18:42,356
<i>Rogue One is hit. I'm going in.</i>

1288
02:18:43,274 --> 02:18:44,650
Sorry, Jake.

1289
02:18:53,534 --> 02:18:54,577
Fire.

1290
02:19:12,720 --> 02:19:15,181
Tsu'tey! Brother, do you read?

1291
02:19:18,058 --> 02:19:19,685
Rogue One, you copy?

1292
02:19:21,729 --> 02:19:22,855
Trudy!

1293
02:19:33,782 --> 02:19:35,034
Time to target, two minutes.

1294
02:19:35,409 --> 02:19:37,786
Valkyrie 1-6, you are cleared and hot.

1295
02:19:37,912 --> 02:19:40,039
Copy, Dragon.
We are starting our bomb run.

1296
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:49,715
— Arm number one!
— Number one armed!

1297
02:19:51,175 --> 02:19:52,343
<i>Ma Jake!</i>

1298
02:19:54,303 --> 02:19:55,429
I read you.

1299
02:20:04,605 --> 02:20:06,565
<i>— Neytiri!
— Seze's dead.</i>

1300
02:20:07,191 --> 02:20:09,652
They are very close. They are many.

1301
02:20:11,111 --> 02:20:12,571
Do not attack.

1302
02:20:13,197 --> 02:20:15,115
<i>Do you read me, Neytiri?</i>

1303
02:20:17,743 --> 02:20:18,994
Do not attack!

1304
02:20:19,370 --> 02:20:22,498
<i>Fall back now. Get out of there!
That's an order!</i>

1305
02:20:30,631 --> 02:20:31,799
<i>Neytiri!</i>

1306
02:20:33,926 --> 02:20:35,803
<i>I got movement, I got movement.</i>

1307
02:20:35,928 --> 02:20:38,138
Hold position. Something's coming.

1308
02:20:38,264 --> 02:20:40,015
<i>Bravo 1-1, I got a big seating.
Turn screens over.</i>

1309
02:20:40,140 --> 02:20:42,268
<i>— We got movement 200 meters.
— Hold your formation.</i>

1310
02:20:42,393 --> 02:20:44,061
<i>— Be ready.
— Watch your flanks.</i>

1311
02:20:49,233 --> 02:20:50,693
<i>Hundred meters and closing fast.</i>

1312
02:21:07,293 --> 02:21:09,253
We gotta get out of here!

1313
02:21:10,796 --> 02:21:12,464
<i>— Fall back! Fall back!
— Move! Move! Move!</i>

1314
02:21:12,590 --> 02:21:14,967
<i>Fall back! On the run! On the run!</i>

1315
02:21:22,141 --> 02:21:24,810
Jake, Eywa has heard you.

1316
02:21:31,692 --> 02:21:33,444
Eywa has heard you!

1317
02:21:44,038 --> 02:21:45,414
Come on!

1318
02:21:57,718 --> 02:21:59,553
Fall back! Move! Move!

1319
02:22:24,078 --> 02:22:26,664
Sir! All escorts are down or falling back.

1320
02:22:26,789 --> 02:22:30,876
Let's get this done.
Valkyrie 1-6, this is Dragon.

1321
02:22:31,001 --> 02:22:33,838
<i>— Press to target.
— Copy. Pressing to target.</i>

1322
02:22:33,963 --> 02:22:35,923
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

1323
02:22:55,776 --> 02:22:58,195
On my mark. Two, one, mark.

1324
02:22:58,320 --> 02:23:00,990
Drop! Drop! Drop! Go, go, go, go!

1325
02:23:34,773 --> 02:23:35,900
Brace!

1326
02:23:52,958 --> 02:23:54,251
It's Sully.

1327
02:24:08,015 --> 02:24:10,267
— Mask on!
— Breach alarm !

1328
02:26:47,466 --> 02:26:49,301
Come on. Come to papa.

1329
02:27:16,829 --> 02:27:18,581
Give it up, Quaritch!

1330
02:27:21,667 --> 02:27:23,127
It's all over.

1331
02:27:24,420 --> 02:27:26,839
<i>Nothing's over while I'm breathing.</i>

1332
02:27:26,964 --> 02:27:29,216
I kind of hoped you'd say that.

1333
02:28:25,397 --> 02:28:26,565
Come on!

1334
02:28:42,498 --> 02:28:46,544
Hey, Sully,
how's it feel to betray your own race?

1335
02:28:51,257 --> 02:28:53,384
You think you're one of them?

1336
02:28:54,677 --> 02:28:56,262
Time to wake up.

1337
02:30:40,533 --> 02:30:41,534
Jake?

1338
02:30:55,297 --> 02:30:56,340
Jake.

1339
02:31:14,400 --> 02:31:15,734
Jake.

1340
02:31:31,834 --> 02:31:33,794
<i>Jake! Ma Jake!</i>

1341
02:32:15,461 --> 02:32:16,754
I See you.

1342
02:32:22,468 --> 02:32:23,761
I See you.

1343
02:32:35,397 --> 02:32:38,192
<i>The aliens went back to their dying world.</i>

1344
02:32:40,402 --> 02:32:43,280
<i>Only a few were chosen to stay.</i>

1345
02:32:55,501 --> 02:32:57,962
<i>The time of great sorrow was ending.</i>

1346
02:33:00,089 --> 02:33:02,466
<i>Toruk Macto was no longer needed.</i>

1347
02:33:15,020 --> 02:33:18,899
<i>Well, I guess this is my last video log.</i>

1348
02:33:20,776 --> 02:33:24,530
<i>'Cause whatever happens tonight,
either way, I'm… </i>

1349
02:33:25,614 --> 02:33:28,409
<i>I'm not gonna be coming back
