2
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:29,047
{y:i}There's a moment of orderly silence
before a football play begins.

3
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,092
{y:i}Players are in position,
linemen are frozen,

4
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,551
{y:i}and anything's possible.

5
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:37,931
{y:i}TV commentary

6
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:42,519
{y:i}Then, like a traffic accident,
staff begins to randomly collide.

7
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,064
{y:i}From the snap of the ball
to the snap of the first bone

8
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,942
{y:i}is closer to four seconds than five.

9
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:54,364
{y:i}TV commentary

10
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,451
{y:i}One Mississippi.

11
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,704
{y:i}Joe Theismann,
the Redskins quarterback

12
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,997
{y:i}takes the snap and hands off
to his running back.

13
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,791
{y:i}TV commentary

14
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,501
{y:i}Two Mississippi.

15
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,920
{y:i}It's a trick play, a flea flicker,

16
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:11,965
{y:i}and the running back tosses the ball
back to the quarterback.

17
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,883
{y:i}TV commentary

18
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,052
{y:i}Three Mississippi.

19
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:20,306
{y:i}Up to now the play's been defined
by the what the quarterback sees.

20
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,518
{y:i}It's about to be defined
by what he doesn't.

21
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:25,812
{y:i}Four Mississippi.

22
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:29,607
{y:i}Lawrence Taylor is the best
defensive player in the NFL

23
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:33,236
{y:i}and has been from the time he stepped
onto the field as a rookie.

24
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,281
{y:i}TV commentary

25
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:41,119
{y:i}TV commentary

26
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,748
{y:i}He will also change the game of football
as we know it.

27
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,500
{y:i}...And we'll look at it
with the reverse angle one more time.

28
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,670
{y:i}And I suggest if your stomach is weak
you just don't watch ...

29
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:55,467
{y:i}Legendary quarterback Joe Thiessman
never played another down of football.

30
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,971
{y:i}Now, y'all would guess
that more often than not

31
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:03,516
{y:i}the highest paid player on
an NFL team is the quarterback.

32
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,851
{y:i}And you'd be right.

33
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,771
{y:i}What you probably don't know
is that more often than not

34
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:11,441
{y:i}the second highest paid player is,
thanks to Lawrence Taylor,

35
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:12,817
{y:i}a left tackle.

36
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,819
{y:i}Because, as every housewife knows,

37
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,946
{y:i}the first check you write
is for the mortgage

38
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,741
{y:i}but the second is for the insurence.

39
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:22,577
{y:i}And the left tackle's job
is to protect the quarterback

40
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,039
{y:i}form what he can't see coming.
To protect his blind side.

41
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:30,293
{y:i}The ideal left tackle is big,
but a lot od people are big.

42
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,338
{y:i}He is wide in the butt
and massive in the thighs.

43
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:37,550
{y:i}He has long arms, giant hands
and feet as quick as a hiccup.

44
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,347
{y:i}This is a rare and expensive combination

45
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,266
{y:i}the need for which can be traced
to that Monday night game

46
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,310
{y:i}and Lawrence Taylor.

47
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:51,356
{y:i}For on that day he not only
altered Joe Theismann's life,

48
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,817
{y:i}but mine as well.

49
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,574
Mr. Oher?

50
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,618
Mr. Oher?

51
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:07,539
Do you understand..?
Do you know why I'm here?

52
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,041
To... investigate?

53
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:12,085
Yes. To investigate.

54
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,340
Im here to investigate your odd...
predicament.

55
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,011
Do you find the odd?
Your predicament?

56
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,431
Michael?...

57
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,891
Iono.
[I don't know]

58
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:29,978
Can I... can I leave now?

59
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,688
No. You can't.

60
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,592
# Strange face, with your eyes #

61
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,847
# So pale and sincere #

62
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:11,186
# Underneath, you know well #

63
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,358
# You have nothing to fear #

64
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,614
# For the dreams that came to you #

65
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,617
# when you were young #

66
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:32,749
# Told of a life where #

67
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,338
# Spring has crawled #

68
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:52,185
# You would seem so frail #

69
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,023
# In the cold of the night #

70
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,404
# When the armies of emotion #

71
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,242
# Go out to fight #

72
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:12,872
# But while the earth #

73
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,711
# sinks to its grave #

74
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,633
# You sail to the sky #

75
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:28,430
# On the crest of a wave #

76
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,236
They say you the coach.

77
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,405
Bert Cotton.

78
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:49,534
Tony Hamilton, but everybody
just calls me big Tony.

79
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,166
Hey, Big Mike! Check it out.

80
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:00,086
Not even locked!

81
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,548
White people are crazy.

82
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,971
I promises my mama Boo, on her deathbed

83
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:13,767
that I'd get my son Steven outta
public school and into a church school.

84
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:17,937
I appreciate that, Tony.
But I'm not involved with admissions.

85
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,066
This figured maybe I'd come
to talk to you,

86
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,235
seeing as you might need some players.

87
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,737
What kind of sport
is he playing?

88
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,948
Anything with a ball.
Boy's good, too.

89
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,286
Classes start in a week. It would
have to be for the next semester.

90
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:37,791
I know, what you're thinking, Coach.
But, look here, I got money, alright?

91
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,795
See I'm mechanic at Wilson's Auto
t'other side of town.

92
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,298
Look, what if somebody drops out
or moves?

93
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,509
Could they get in then?

94
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,969
"They?"
You only mentioned one son.

95
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:53,306
That's right, Steven.
But there's another boy.

96
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,351
- Another boy?
- Yeah.

97
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:01,439
Big Mike.

98
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,400
Sleeps on my coach
from time to time.

99
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,152
It's a bad deal. You know,
his mama's on the crack pipe.

100
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:08,113
He ain't got nobody else.

101
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,073
He just wanted to come along
for the ride.

102
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,242
- They're here?
- Yeah.

103
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,370
The little one is Steven

104
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,081
and the big one...

105
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,666
Big Mike.

106
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,843
Switch!

107
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,222
{y:i}Mike!

108
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,851
Come on!

109
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,526
Mother of God....

110
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:50,613
Steven Hamilton's paperwork
looks acceptable to me.

111
00:08:50,697 --> 00:08:52,907
And I believe he would do fine.

112
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,951
- But this other kid...
- Big Mike.

113
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,580
Michael Oher gives us
no reason to believe it,

114
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:02,250
based on his record,
that he would be successful here.

115
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,793
How bad could it be?

116
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,505
We're not exactly sure how old
he is due to lack of records.

117
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:11,134
He has a measured IQ of 80.
Which is 6th percentile.

118
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,137
His grade point average begins with zero.

119
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,597
Zero-point-six.

120
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,724
Everyone passed him along

121
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:22,479
they gave him D's so they could hand
their problem off to the next school.

122
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,981
It's a brave kid.

123
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,402
For wanting to come here.

124
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,863
For wanting a quality education.

125
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:36,534
An education denied him by the poor
quality of the schools he's attended.

126
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,161
I tell you most kids
with his background

127
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,455
wouldn't come within two hundred miles
of this place.

128
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:45,585
Coach Cotton, we understand your interest
in this young man's athletic abilities.

129
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,713
Now, he wouldn't be able to play sports
until he got his grades up anyway.

130
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,715
Forget sports!

131
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,801
Look at the wall.

132
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,052
Christian.

133
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,597
We either take that seriously
or we paint over it.

134
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:01,226
You don't admit Michael Oher
because of sports,

135
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,979
you admit him
because it's the right thing to do.

136
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,777
Class, this is Michael Oher
and he's new here

137
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:55,572
so I expect you all
to make him feel welcome.

138
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,241
Mike, just take any empty seat.

139
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:05,957
This is a quiz based on the information
you learned last year

140
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:08,126
in your science curriculum.

141
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,087
Don't worry.
It's not gonna be graded.

142
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,007
I just want to see how much
information we need to hit again.

143
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,593
Just answer whatever you know.

144
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,502
Thank you.

145
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,146
- Can I leave now?
- Yeah.

146
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,112
Take your book.

147
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,590
{y:i}Why should he always stay in our home?

148
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,926
{y:i}- He's gonna eat all our food.
- This is not true.

149
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:41,594
{y:i}I try to be Christian abot the son,
alright?

150
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:44,014
{y:i}Let somebody else be
Christian about this kid.

151
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,392
{y:i}You want me to throw him out
on the street like some dog?

152
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:49,394
{y:i}Let somebody else take
over the responsibility!

153
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,272
{y:i}Should I throw him out
on the street?

154
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,607
{y:i}He's here all the time.
I just want to be with you!

155
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,985
{y:i}Alright. Alright.

156
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,279
{y:i}You win. I'll take care of it.

157
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,369
I don't care if Patrick Ramsey
approved the chair.

158
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:10,081
He's the NFL quarterback
not Martha frickin' Stewart.

159
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:14,294
Because there's a difference between
Bunny Williams and a La-Z-boy.

160
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,047
No. See, when MTV Cribs
comes to his house

161
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,965
he's gonna be showing off
his home theatre

162
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:21,384
all I'm gonna see is
a brown Barca-lounger.

163
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,554
No. No, listen to me.
I'm the designer, my name's on it.

164
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,724
Deliver what I ordered!
Alright? Thank you.

165
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,074
- What'd I miss?
- Collins has just got a dig.

166
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,911
It's a girl's volleyball, Mom.
You didn't miss anything.

167
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,334
- Come on Collins! Move your feet! Come on!
- Good job, Collins!

168
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:55,919
Go!

169
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:00,924
Collins, we're gonna wait
for you outside.

170
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,259
But don't double condition in
the shower, you have homework!

171
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,053
I'm going over to Cannon's to study.

172
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:08,181
SJ! SJ, do not go to the
broad locker room again.

173
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,558
Come here!
SJ, come here!

174
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:26,116
Well, the big kid's been here
for a month

175
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,743
he's still not cutting in my class.

176
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,453
Why this Admissions do this?

177
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,664
I mean, it's not fair to us or the boy.

178
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:34,457
Just setting him up to fail.

179
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,918
I don't think, he has any idea
what I'm teaching.

180
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:40,547
And how would you know if he did?
He won't even talk.

181
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,425
- He writes.
- His name. Barely.

182
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,929
He thew this in the trash can.

183
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:53,935
"I look and I see white everywhere:

184
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:58,565
white walls, white floors,
and a lot of white people.

185
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:04,446
The teachers do not know I have no idea
of anything they are talking about.

186
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,199
I do not want to listen to anyone,
especially the teachers.

187
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:10,535
They are giving homework
and expecting me

188
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,704
to do problems on my own.

189
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,499
I have never done homework
in my life.

190
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,879
I go to the bathroom,
look in the mirror and say,

191
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,257
"This is not Michael Oher."

192
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,805
He entitled it "White Walls."

193
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:32,807
How's the spelling?

194
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,071
Hi.

195
00:15:53,411 --> 00:15:55,038
Smile at 'em.

196
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,916
And that let them know
you're their friend.

197
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,214
You're Big Mike, right?

198
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:07,634
I'm Sean.
But everyone calls me SJ.

199
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,594
It's for Sean junior,

200
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,138
my Father's name is Sean. Sean Tuohy.

201
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,766
He was a basketball star
at Ole Miss, point guard,

202
00:16:14,849 --> 00:16:17,352
now he owns like
a million Taco Bells.

203
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:22,691
Maòana'.

204
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:30,198
- Who's that SJ?
- Big Mike.

205
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,327
Get you feet off my dash.

206
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,580
Thank you. Put on your seatbelt!

207
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:46,589
Big Mike?

208
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:53,555
Mike, I got a call from someone
at the police departement.

209
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:01,521
Do you remember the story in the papers
while back about...

210
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:05,567
a man who fell off an overpass?

211
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:11,865
No one knew who he was
and or he jumped, or...

212
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:18,371
Umm... anyway he...
he passed away.

213
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,878
Mike, the man was your father.

214
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,259
They've been looking for somebody to
notify and they...

215
00:17:31,343 --> 00:17:34,220
They found your name on our registry.

216
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,558
I'm really sorry, son.

217
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,066
You were close to him?

218
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:53,156
When's the last time you saw him?

219
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,038
Iono.

220
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:36,134
- He knows it!
- Who knows it and what is he know?

221
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,763
The material. Michael Oher.
I gave him this test verbally.

222
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,681
- Got even allowed?
- I see.

223
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:44,559
- On how big a curve?
- He's been listening all along.

224
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:48,021
It's amazing what he's absorbed.
Trust me. He's listening to you, too.

225
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,565
Now, his reading level is low

226
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:53,777
and he's got no idea how to learn
in the classroom.

227
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:58,907
I'm not saying he's going to pass
but Big Mike is not stupid.

228
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,325
- Hey.
- What, Mom?

229
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,659
- Good job.
- Yes?

230
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,536
Good job.
Hey, I got a question for you.

231
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,829
Go.

232
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:07,082
There was a little girl
about two rows back.

233
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:08,375
What was her name?

234
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,835
- Oh, that was Chimsey.
- Kinsey. Yeah.

235
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:13,129
I saw your little indian feathers
get all ruffle up.

236
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,798
Yeah. It's nice.

237
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:18,009
SJ, don't let this go to your head
but I've thought you were

238
00:20:18,093 --> 00:20:19,969
very convincing in the role of...

239
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,971
- Indian Number Three.
- Yes.

240
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:25,600
I tried out for the Chief
but they gave it to Andy Sung.

241
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:29,896
I can't be sure, but I think there was
some multi-cultural bias thing working.

242
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:32,649
Or maybe they just thought
he'd make a better Chief.

243
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,693
Dad, he's like Chinese.

244
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,319
Yeah. You're Irish.

245
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,571
And if you weren't the Chief,
how did you get that headdress?

246
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:42,826
Dad, I'm gonna need a few more
of those free Quesadilla tickets.

247
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:46,996
And where does the acorn fall?

248
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,250
Hey, don't laugh too hard.
The Quesadilla saved our ass.

249
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,460
Don't use the a-word.

250
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,884
What is he wearing?

251
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,178
It's freezing.

252
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:03,847
What's his name again?

253
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,432
Big Mike.

254
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:08,101
Where's he going?

255
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,022
Hey, Big Mike!
Where you headin'?

256
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,274
Gym....

257
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,401
Okay.

258
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:29,330
Turn around.

259
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:38,631
Big Mike...
Stop the car.

260
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,096
Big Mike.

261
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:48,224
Hey, my name is Leigh Anne Tuohy.
My kids go to Wingate.

262
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:50,977
You said you're going to the gym?

263
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,480
The school gym's closed.

264
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:55,648
Why were you going to the gym?

265
00:21:57,192 --> 00:22:00,195
Big Mike?!
Why were you going to the gym?

266
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:03,031
Because... it's warm.

267
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:07,327
Do you have any place to stay tonight?

268
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:10,205
Don't you dare lie to me.

269
00:22:22,217 --> 00:22:24,386
I've seen that look many times.

270
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:26,513
She's about to get her way.

271
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,890
Come on.

272
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:32,394
Come on.

273
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,190
SJ, make room.

274
00:22:37,691 --> 00:22:39,150
Get in the car.

275
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,487
Come on.

276
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:56,209
- Where are we going?
- Home.

277
00:23:11,516 --> 00:23:13,768
Oh no! That's my favourite part.

278
00:23:13,852 --> 00:23:15,478
So cute.

279
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:19,274
How'd the dork do
in the school play?

280
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,780
Umm... Okay.

281
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:29,034
Collins, you know Big Mike
from the School?

282
00:23:30,785 --> 00:23:34,497
I'd give you the best bedroom
but it's full of sample boxes.

283
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:38,043
And the sectional in the family room
slides apart when you sleep on it.

284
00:23:38,126 --> 00:23:40,337
At least that's what Sean says.

285
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,380
Mr. Tuohy sleeps on the coach?

286
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:44,132
Only when he's bad. Alright.

287
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:47,927
The powder room's right there and
we'll be upstairs if you need us.

288
00:23:48,011 --> 00:23:49,763
Alright? Right.

289
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:51,931
Sleep tight, honey.

290
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:48,613
- Was this a bad idea?
- What?

291
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:52,117
Don't lie there and pretend like you're
not thinking the same thing as me.

292
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,535
Fine, tell me what you're thinking

293
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:56,079
so I know what's supposed to be
on my mind.

294
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:58,206
How well do you know Big Mike?

295
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:00,834
In case you haven't noticed
he doesn't have much to say.

296
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:04,462
What's the big deal?
It's just for one night, right?

297
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,675
It is just one night, right?
Leigh Anne?

298
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:13,805
You don't think he'll steal anything,
do you?

299
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:16,850
I guess we'll know in the morning.

300
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:36,036
Well if you hear a scream
call the insurence adjustor.

301
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:56,765
Mike?

302
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,817
Big Mike?!

303
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:10,528
Mike?

304
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,251
Big Mike!

305
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:36,221
You're gonna make me
walking away?

306
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,098
Alright then.

307
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,850
Where are you going?

308
00:26:41,226 --> 00:26:42,560
Iono.

309
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:46,189
Well, are you spending Thanksgiving
with your family?

310
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:49,526
{y:i}TV commentary

311
00:26:50,235 --> 00:26:52,112
{y:i}TV commentary

312
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:54,447
- Come and get it, childs!
- Yeah, baby!

313
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:56,032
SJ!

314
00:26:56,491 --> 00:26:57,701
Come on!

315
00:26:58,827 --> 00:27:00,620
We have a ramble turkey.

316
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:03,331
Everyone thank your mother for driving
to the store and getting this.

317
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:04,958
- Thank you, mama.
- Thank you, mama.

318
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,668
Limp football.

319
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,378
Eat all you want.

320
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,963
Come on.

321
00:27:10,213 --> 00:27:11,589
Hustle, hustle!
We got to get back to the game.

322
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:12,799
Oh yeah!

323
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:16,636
- Don't take my space.
- You rush us, dad.

324
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,971
- SJ, come down.
- Come on.

325
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:20,306
- No.
- That's just fantastic.

326
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:25,020
Oh, y'all forget the potato salad!

327
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:28,481
- How's Ole Miss doing?
- xxx kicking butt.

328
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:37,198
Sean, salad.

329
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:40,910
- Thanks, Mom.
- Oh, good. Thanks, Mama.

330
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:42,495
Yeah, Mama.

331
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,124
- Come on!
- Come on!

332
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,301
{y:i}He wants to be bet.

333
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,313
- Hey! Mom!
- Whoa.

334
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:10,732
But it's Thanksgiving.

335
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:13,193
Wow.

336
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:15,612
- Why are we in here?
- Shhh!

337
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,746
Shall we say a grace?

338
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:46,434
Heavenly Father. We thank you for
all the many blessings on this family.

339
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,230
We thank you for bringing us
a new friend.

340
00:28:50,522 --> 00:28:53,817
And we ask that you look after us
in this holiday season

341
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,362
that we may never forget
how very fortunate we are.

342
00:28:57,821 --> 00:28:59,781
- Amen.
- Amen.

343
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,494
- SJ, the score?
- Up by ten.

344
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:09,666
Collins, can you pass me
the green beans, please?

345
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:13,294
Don't pick it with your fingers
just take a spoon. Okay.

346
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:19,759
- SJ! Elbows!
- Sorry.

347
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:26,057
So, Big Mike. You like to shop?

348
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:32,105
Because tomorrow I think I'll have
to show you how it's done.

349
00:29:36,234 --> 00:29:38,028
I got clothes.

350
00:29:38,153 --> 00:29:40,321
You "have" clothes.

351
00:29:40,488 --> 00:29:44,325
And an extra T-shirt in the plastic bag
does not a wardrobe make.

352
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:45,994
I have clothes.

353
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:49,664
Fine, let's go get 'em.
Just tell me where I'm going.

354
00:29:59,382 --> 00:30:03,136
Alright. Tell me everything
I need to know about you.

355
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:06,222
Who takes care of you?
A mother?

356
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:10,143
Do you have any mother?
A grandmother maybe?

357
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,150
Tell you what, Big Mike.

358
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:19,694
We can do this the easy way,
or we can do it the hard way.

359
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:21,571
You take a pick.

360
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:26,117
Fine.

361
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:32,415
Tell me just one thing I should know
about you. Just... just one.

362
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:37,170
I don't like to be called Big Mike.

363
00:30:38,171 --> 00:30:39,631
Okay.

364
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:44,928
Tell you what, from now on,
to me, you're Michael. Okay?

365
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:52,394
So,... Michael,
where we headed?

366
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:57,190
xxx
everything, right?

367
00:30:57,273 --> 00:31:00,026
Savi.
Savi, give it to me.

368
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:01,778
She's just the ...

369
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:04,030
- Hey, B.J.
- Hey.

370
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:06,491
- That's nice
- Yo. Check it.

371
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:08,451
- Yay.
- S7.

372
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:10,870
For real. Yeah.

373
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:12,455
You like that?

374
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,333
- xxx
- Do you know 'em?

375
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:17,627
Man, I got no idea.

376
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:20,380
It's where your mother lives?

377
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:23,299
- Let's go get 'em.
- No. Don't get out.

378
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:27,095
Who's going to help you carrying
your clothes, Michael?

379
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:31,516
Don't get out of the car.

380
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:39,399
No way.

381
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:42,861
Oh, that's Big Mike, man.

382
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:45,363
Oh, Big Mike is in the house!

383
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:50,326
Big Mike! Where you been?!

384
00:31:52,537 --> 00:31:57,292
And who's that fine thing that
driving you around like Ms. Daisy?

385
00:31:57,459 --> 00:31:58,960
Hey, Dave.

386
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:03,173
You need to let me buy you new snickers, man.
I'll take care, you know.

387
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:09,637
I run this over here and the
whole Village, baby. Got it?

388
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:11,181
Look at that.

389
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:15,060
Hey. Hey, D. Watch this.

390
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,979
They always go for the wing.
Watch this. Big.

391
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:19,564
Dear snowflake.

392
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:22,484
You like that? Yeah.

393
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:15,745
She wasn't home.

394
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:21,459
Well, we can come back.

395
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:27,924
She prolly moved to a nicer place.

396
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:43,523
I've lived in Memphis my whole life
and never been anywhere near here.

397
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:47,027
You're going to take care of me, right?

398
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,903
I got your back.

399
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:53,491
xxx

400
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:56,161
Here we go.

401
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:59,414
Oh, we also got a parole
for the ladies.

402
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:03,585
But everything we got that'd fit him
is right here.

403
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:07,172
This is it?

404
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:10,592
If this is all you got, why's it say
"Big and Tall" on the sign?

405
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:13,762
Big and Tall.
You need "Bigger and Taller."

406
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:18,516
- Howl, if you need me.
- Thank you.

407
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,893
You see anything, you like?

408
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:22,645
{y:i}Hey. I got a just
what you're looking for.

409
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,814
Well, one thing I know
about shopping is

410
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:28,026
that if you don't absolutely love it
in the store, you won't wear it.

411
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,362
The store is, were you like it best.

412
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:33,615
So before you choose something
think of yourself wearing it

413
00:34:33,698 --> 00:34:36,785
and say to yourself:
Is this me?

414
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:38,953
{y:i}No.

415
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:41,915
What about this one?

416
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:49,047
This isn't atrocious.

417
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:54,010
Alright, well, you go look over there
I go look over here.

418
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:00,141
Who would imagine this many clothes
are plastic?

419
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:06,106
Good Lord...
What is this made of?

420
00:35:11,611 --> 00:35:14,739
That's the one?
That's the one you like?

421
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:19,828
Alright then.

422
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:36,803
Have a great day.
Learn something!

423
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:48,064
Don't get your panties in a wad.

424
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:55,196
The best part about Paris was the food.
They use sauce like we use gravy.

425
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,533
I had to join a gym the day I got back.

426
00:36:00,368 --> 00:36:02,912
Any of y'all spent much time
on the other side of town?

427
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:06,374
- Where exactly are you talking about?
- Alabama Street... Hurt Village.

428
00:36:06,458 --> 00:36:09,336
Hurt Village - that sounds like a threat.

429
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:10,712
You're not far off.

430
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:14,758
- I think it might "hurt" me to go there.
- It'd hurt your reputation to go there.

431
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:17,469
Well actually I'm from there
but didn't mind hard work

432
00:36:17,552 --> 00:36:19,012
and look where I am now.

433
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:21,681
Eating an eighteen dollar salad.

434
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:23,892
And it's a little soggy to be honest.

435
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:26,186
Leigh Anne? What is this sudden interest
in the project?

436
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:27,771
Is this another one
of your charities?

437
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:30,690
Wait. A project for the projects.

438
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:33,860
Oh, that's catchy.
Money would raise itself.

439
00:36:33,943 --> 00:36:36,446
Okay. Count me in, Leigh Anne.

440
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,699
- xxx
- xxx

441
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,745
SJ, you have two more minutes
on that playbox thing, alright?

442
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:45,330
{y:i}Oh, Mom!

443
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:53,296
Michael, do you want to stay here?

444
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:59,761
Because... if you want to stay here...
for awhile longer...

445
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,182
I can find some time to figure out
a bedroom for you.

446
00:37:06,643 --> 00:37:11,815
Because look at this, you've practically
ruined a ten thousand dollar coach.

447
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,115
You want to stay here, Michael?

448
00:37:22,117 --> 00:37:24,786
I don't want to go anyplace else.

449
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:31,960
Well alright then.

450
00:37:34,671 --> 00:37:38,508
- SJ, you'd better be off that playbox.
- That wasn't two minutes.

451
00:37:39,676 --> 00:37:41,386
Good night Mrs. Tuohy.

452
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,686
I see on the admission that
we're Michael's contact

453
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:51,146
for medical emergencies?

454
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:52,856
Sean wrote that in last week.

455
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:56,568
We needed contact number and the ones
listed weren't in service.

456
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:58,653
Sean. Love that man.

457
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:01,781
What's this?

458
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:06,036
The state makes schools measure
for career aptitude in eight grade.

459
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:08,038
and this just came with his file.

460
00:38:08,121 --> 00:38:09,539
What does it say
about Michael?

461
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:14,753
Spatial relations - third percentile.
Ability to learn - fifth percentile.

462
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:20,508
It's funny though. He tested in
the 98th percentile in one category.

463
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:24,054
- Which one?
- "Protective instincts."

464
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:30,310
So over here we have a desk.
Chest o'drawers.

465
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:33,855
Here's a night stand, a lamp, Alarm.

466
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:37,859
Sean says all the pro athletes use futons
if they can't find a bed big enough.

467
00:38:37,942 --> 00:38:40,820
So I got you one of those
'cause frames xxx

468
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:44,699
It's not about to let that in my house.
But I got you some nicer.

469
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:48,370
- It's mine?
- Yes, sir.

470
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:51,623
What?

471
00:38:51,706 --> 00:38:53,667
Never had one before.

472
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,002
What? A room to yourself?

473
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:57,754
A bed.

474
00:39:07,347 --> 00:39:09,516
Well, you have one now.

475
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:44,384
Okay. Define Osmosis.

476
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:47,554
I think I know what.

477
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:51,349
It's when water passes
through the barrier.

478
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:55,145
That's basically right.
Michael we'll get it.

479
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:05,572
Name the combatants in the battle
of Waterloo.

480
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:08,700
I know that one. Umm...

481
00:40:09,284 --> 00:40:13,079
The little guy, Napoleon...
He was on one side and...

482
00:40:14,247 --> 00:40:16,958
- ...and Duku's on the other.
- Duke of Wellington.

483
00:40:17,042 --> 00:40:20,253
Yeah. And the Duke of Wellington
and Russia or something.

484
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:21,838
Prussia.

485
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:39,856
Enough with the rugby shirts.
You look like a giant bumble bee.

486
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:47,864
That Taco Bell, KFC catty corner.
The Long John Silvers on the next block.

487
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:50,867
- You owe all of 'em?
- Yeah. We've got like hundreds.

488
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,160
Eighty five.

489
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:54,287
Is that why Mr. Tuohy don't
have to go to work?

490
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:58,208
Ho! Ho! Hey! I'm working
even when I'm not working.

491
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:00,543
What?

492
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:02,629
And y'all eat at those places for free?

493
00:41:02,712 --> 00:41:04,756
All you want. It's awesome.

494
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:07,509
What do y'all do with the leftover food?
From the restaurant?

495
00:41:07,592 --> 00:41:10,303
Well, we have to throw some of it away.
What's already been cooked.

496
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:13,348
- That's too bed.
- Yeah. I'd rather sell it.

497
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:15,850
Seems like you could give it away
or something?

498
00:41:15,934 --> 00:41:19,813
- You should check into that, Daddy.
- Alright, I will, SJ.

499
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:22,607
How come we ain't eatin' at one
of your restaurants tonight?

500
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:25,568
Because tonight is a special occasion.

501
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:26,861
What?

502
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:30,365
I talked to Coach Cotton and he said that
Michael's grades had improved enough

503
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:33,076
that he can go out for spring football
in March.

504
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,244
Isn't that great?

505
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:37,330
Oh, man!
You are gonna crush some people!

506
00:41:44,129 --> 00:41:47,590
- Hey, guys. How you doin'?
- Great. Thank you.

507
00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:51,177
I've got a design book I need to get.
Sean, go check on our reservation.

508
00:41:51,261 --> 00:41:53,013
They're gonna seat us right away.
Can't you wait after dinner.

509
00:41:53,096 --> 00:41:55,348
Might be closed by then!
Come on, SJ.

510
00:41:55,432 --> 00:41:58,018
- Please.
- I need some new magazines.

511
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:02,564
Michael, come on. Come on.

512
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:15,744
Collins! Collins!

513
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:18,496
Collins. Come on!
Your dad's already PO'ed.

514
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:21,207
- Lets' go. Come on.
- Over here.

515
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:24,002
Mike.

516
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:31,301
Remember this one, Mom?

517
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:34,262
You read it to us
like thousand times.

518
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:38,600
"And he gnashed his terrible teeth
and he roared his terrible roar."

519
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:40,769
I always liked this one.

520
00:42:40,852 --> 00:42:43,438
Oh, Ferdinand...
Me too.

521
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:49,027
Michael, your mama ever read
either one of those books to you?

522
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:52,655
No?

523
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,492
How cute.

524
00:42:55,825 --> 00:42:57,160
It was a good steak.

525
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:59,954
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Thank you for lovely dinner, Papa.

526
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:01,581
Here we go.

527
00:43:36,866 --> 00:43:38,284
Michael?...

528
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:41,579
Who was that boy you were
talking to, at the restaurant?

529
00:43:41,663 --> 00:43:43,164
Marcus.

530
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,668
Marcus. And he works there?

531
00:43:46,751 --> 00:43:48,253
Yeah.

532
00:43:49,504 --> 00:43:51,506
How do you know him?

533
00:43:52,882 --> 00:43:54,718
He's my brother.

534
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,686
Well, we'd really like
to meet him someday.

535
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:08,189
Would that be okay with you?

536
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:10,900
I don't know where he stays.

537
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:13,737
When's the last time you saw him?

538
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:18,700
When I was little mebbe.

539
00:44:22,746 --> 00:44:28,960
"Once upon a time in Spain, there was a
little bull and his name was Ferdinand.

540
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:33,715
All the other little bulls he lived with
would run and jump

541
00:44:33,798 --> 00:44:36,301
and butt their heads together,

542
00:44:37,385 --> 00:44:39,304
but not Ferdinand.

543
00:44:41,139 --> 00:44:45,477
He liked to sit just quietly
and smell the flowers.

544
00:44:47,937 --> 00:44:51,858
He had a favorite spot out in the pasture
under a cork tree.

545
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:55,612
It was his favorite tree

546
00:44:55,695 --> 00:45:00,867
and he would sit in its shade all day
and smell the flowers."

547
00:45:01,409 --> 00:45:03,703
- Good night.
- Good night.

548
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,042
What?

549
00:45:09,459 --> 00:45:11,461
Why are you smiling?

550
00:45:11,836 --> 00:45:15,465
I don't know. I'm just happy.
Really happy.

551
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:19,344
Does this happiness have anything
to do with Michael?

552
00:45:19,427 --> 00:45:20,929
No.

553
00:45:21,971 --> 00:45:24,849
It has everything to do with Michael.

554
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,689
Happy's good.

555
00:45:31,481 --> 00:45:33,566
You know what I think we should do?

556
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:36,569
We should start a charity
for kids like Michael.

557
00:45:36,653 --> 00:45:37,362
Okay.

558
00:45:37,445 --> 00:45:39,948
- Maybe fund a program at Wingate.
- Sure.

559
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:42,742
Lord knows that school
could use a little color.

560
00:45:42,826 --> 00:45:46,329
Michael's like a flying and milking
that place.

561
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:48,790
Are you listening to me?

562
00:45:51,751 --> 00:45:59,050
I try to concentrate on one...
thing... at a time.

563
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:03,221
You knew I was multi-tasker
when you married me, right?

564
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:06,641
- I sure did.
- Alright. Okay. Let's check it.

565
00:46:11,021 --> 00:46:14,941
Okay. Tuohy family.
Big smiles everyone!

566
00:46:16,151 --> 00:46:19,571
And, one , two, three...

567
00:46:22,657 --> 00:46:25,994
Michael! Michael come over here
and get in the next one.

568
00:46:26,077 --> 00:46:29,247
Come on. Come on. Come over here.

569
00:46:34,544 --> 00:46:37,714
Oh, come on. It's not like I'm gonna
put it on the Christmas card.

570
00:46:37,797 --> 00:46:41,926
Okay, let's scootch in a little tighter.

571
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:43,720
That's good.

572
00:46:44,512 --> 00:46:46,014
Really big smiles.

573
00:46:46,097 --> 00:46:49,684
Okay, one, two three... say Rebels!

574
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:51,311
"Rebels"

575
00:46:54,606 --> 00:47:00,028
{y:i}TV commentary

576
00:47:00,111 --> 00:47:01,613
I got it.

577
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:04,991
- Who's winning?
- Tennessee.

578
00:47:05,617 --> 00:47:07,619
- Who are they playing?
- Clemson.

579
00:47:07,702 --> 00:47:10,163
Your mom roots against Tennessee
no matter who they're playing?

580
00:47:10,246 --> 00:47:13,041
Oh, yes, I do. With gusto.

581
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:15,210
She can't stand Tennessee.

582
00:47:15,293 --> 00:47:18,463
Collie-bell, I thought you were
going to your boyfriend's?

583
00:47:18,546 --> 00:47:21,466
I thought of hanging around here today.

584
00:47:22,884 --> 00:47:24,511
I like that.

585
00:47:24,678 --> 00:47:27,472
Hey, baby. There's a coupla messages
on the machine but I didn't check 'em.

586
00:47:27,555 --> 00:47:29,057
Alright.

587
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,603
{y:i}Hey, Sean, hey, Leigh Anne,
It's cousin Bobby. Happy New Years!

588
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:35,647
Listen, I've had about five cold ones...

589
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:39,401
- Of course she had. - So I'm...
I'm just gonna go ahead and ask...

590
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:42,821
Ya'll know there's a colored boy
in your Christmas Card?

591
00:47:45,907 --> 00:47:47,117
What?

592
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:53,581
You just looked teeny-tiny next to him.
Right? Like Jessica Lange and King Kong.

593
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:57,335
Hey, does Michael get the family discount
at Taco Bell?

594
00:47:57,419 --> 00:48:00,880
Because if he does Sean's gonna lose
a few stores.

595
00:48:01,172 --> 00:48:02,382
He's a great kid.

596
00:48:02,465 --> 00:48:05,760
Well, I say make it official
and just adopt him.

597
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:08,596
He's gonna be eighteen
in a few months.

598
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:12,017
Doesn't really make much sense
to legally adopt.

599
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:18,440
Leigh Anne, is this some
sort of white guilt thing?

600
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:21,317
What will your daddy say?

601
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:25,280
Umm... before or after he turns over
in his grave?

602
00:48:25,447 --> 00:48:27,907
Daddy's been gone five years Elaine,

603
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:30,243
make matters worse you were
at the funeral.

604
00:48:30,326 --> 00:48:33,705
Remember? You were Chanel
and that awful black hat.

605
00:48:33,788 --> 00:48:35,665
Look, here's the deal.

606
00:48:35,749 --> 00:48:38,793
I don't need y'all to approve
my choices, alright?

607
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:41,588
But I do ask you to respect them.

608
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:43,548
You've no idea what this boy's
been through.

609
00:48:43,631 --> 00:48:46,384
And If this is going to be
some running diatribe

610
00:48:46,468 --> 00:48:50,013
I can find an overpriced salad
a lot closer to home.

611
00:48:51,222 --> 00:48:52,974
Leigh Anne, I'm so sorry.
We didn't intend to---

612
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:54,601
No. We didn't really.

613
00:48:54,684 --> 00:48:57,937
I think, what you're doing is so great.

614
00:48:58,146 --> 00:49:00,690
To open up your home... to him.

615
00:49:01,274 --> 00:49:04,194
Honey, you're changing that boy's life.

616
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:05,487
No.

617
00:49:06,529 --> 00:49:08,448
He's changing mine.

618
00:49:09,616 --> 00:49:12,911
That's awesome for you,
but what about Collins?

619
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:14,996
What about Collins?

620
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,957
Aren't you worried, I mean,
even just a little?

621
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:20,335
He's a boy, a large, black boy,

622
00:49:20,418 --> 00:49:22,879
sleeping under the same roof.

623
00:49:25,298 --> 00:49:26,966
Shame on you.

624
00:49:31,638 --> 00:49:33,306
I've got this.

625
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:37,560
Be honest with me, okay?

626
00:49:38,978 --> 00:49:42,273
Is Michael being here making
you uncomfortable?

627
00:49:43,316 --> 00:49:46,569
They're stupid kids,
who cares what they say.

628
00:49:46,861 --> 00:49:48,113
What kids?

629
00:49:48,196 --> 00:49:49,572
At school.

630
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:51,866
They're juvenile.

631
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:54,703
And what do they juvenile kids say?

632
00:49:55,161 --> 00:49:57,747
It's really not worth repeating.

633
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:02,210
And don't worry about SJ;
he likes all the attention.

634
00:50:02,794 --> 00:50:05,797
He introduces Michael
as his big brother.

635
00:50:09,634 --> 00:50:12,470
- What about you?
- It's fine.

636
00:50:15,181 --> 00:50:18,476
I mean, you can't just throw him
out on the street.

637
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,062
I can make other arrangements.

638
00:50:24,607 --> 00:50:26,109
- Hi, Mike.
- Hi.

639
00:50:26,192 --> 00:50:28,194
- Need a push?
-Yeah.

640
00:50:34,659 --> 00:50:36,369
Higher, Mike! Higher!

641
00:50:40,248 --> 00:50:41,750
Higher!

642
00:50:46,713 --> 00:50:48,214
Higher!

643
00:50:52,427 --> 00:50:54,971
Don't look down.
Don't look down!

644
00:51:28,797 --> 00:51:31,216
- Where are you going?
- Collins?

645
00:51:43,395 --> 00:51:45,814
Quit looking at me like that.

646
00:51:45,897 --> 00:51:48,566
I mean, we study together at home.

647
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:10,088
You know how much those things weigh?
This kid's gonna make us all famous.

648
00:52:11,548 --> 00:52:13,341
Easy, Bert, man.
It's only the spring

649
00:52:13,425 --> 00:52:15,844
he hasn't even been through
his first practice yet.

650
00:52:15,927 --> 00:52:17,721
No. He's a player.

651
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,267
Ready.

652
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:24,811
Get down, son.
Get down in your stands.

653
00:52:24,894 --> 00:52:26,438
In your stands!

654
00:52:27,063 --> 00:52:28,231
Go!

655
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:35,613
Mike! Son!

656
00:52:36,364 --> 00:52:39,576
You fall off the block and then
you wanna shuck-shuck the blocker.

657
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:42,579
Right? Shuck it!
Alright? Let's go!

658
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,958
Papa?

659
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:50,003
How's he doing?

660
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,630
Doesn't quite have
the hang of it yet.

661
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:00,722
Hey, Mike. Son...

662
00:53:01,014 --> 00:53:03,308
Shuck the blocker. Don't hold him!

663
00:53:06,728 --> 00:53:10,065
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No.

664
00:53:21,326 --> 00:53:23,411
Balloons! There are balloons!

665
00:53:23,828 --> 00:53:26,664
Guys, quit looking at the balloons.
Everybody.

666
00:53:26,831 --> 00:53:29,918
Most kids from bad situations
can't wait to be violent

667
00:53:30,001 --> 00:53:31,753
and that comes out on the field.

668
00:53:31,836 --> 00:53:35,090
This kid, he acts like he doesn't want
to hit anyone.

669
00:53:35,173 --> 00:53:37,008
He's Ferdinand the Bull.

670
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:39,177
- What?
- Nothing.

671
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:41,971
I thought sure he was gonna be a player.

672
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:45,016
I can't believe I used up my chiefs
to get him in school.

673
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:48,353
I thought you said it was
your Christian duty?

674
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,065
Look, Bert. He's never played before.

675
00:53:52,857 --> 00:53:56,361
And he won't this fall if he doesn't
improve a lot before then.

676
00:53:56,444 --> 00:53:58,571
Who xxx made him Bert bright?

677
00:53:59,322 --> 00:54:00,990
Unbelievable!

678
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:04,327
Oh, God bless me.

679
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:06,413
This is your summer workout sheet.

680
00:54:06,496 --> 00:54:09,624
Now, first it says to warm up
and get loose.

681
00:54:09,874 --> 00:54:11,876
Go ahead, get loose.

682
00:54:14,462 --> 00:54:15,797
Are you loose?

683
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:20,218
Okay, next is five one hundred yard runs
to stretch out your legs.

684
00:54:20,301 --> 00:54:21,845
Let's go home,
play some video games.

685
00:54:26,057 --> 00:54:27,726
You don't want to let
them down, do you?

686
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:28,518
Iono.

687
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:29,853
What about Dad and Mom?

688
00:54:29,936 --> 00:54:32,856
'Cause you see, in our family
everyone's an athlete.

689
00:54:32,939 --> 00:54:34,566
Dad was a basketball star,

690
00:54:34,649 --> 00:54:36,901
Collins plays volleyball
and runs track.

691
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:39,487
And me, as you know, I do it all.

692
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:42,198
And Mom...
Mom was a cheerleader,

693
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:45,368
which doesn't exactly count
but don't tell her I said that.

694
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:46,786
- Okay?
- Okay.

695
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:48,038
Okay.

696
00:54:50,749 --> 00:54:54,210
...fifty, fifty one,

697
00:54:55,503 --> 00:54:58,631
fifty two, fifty three...

698
00:54:58,715 --> 00:55:01,343
Come on and get it!
Go, go, go, go, go!

699
00:55:01,551 --> 00:55:04,179
Come on. Five seconds left in the game!

700
00:55:05,597 --> 00:55:07,932
Just like!
Just like!

701
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:11,019
High knees, high knees, high knees!
xxx baby.

702
00:55:11,311 --> 00:55:12,812
Run like the wind!

703
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:16,107
Go, Michael, go!

704
00:55:16,608 --> 00:55:19,569
...ninety eight, nine,

705
00:55:21,488 --> 00:55:22,655
one hundred.

706
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:24,741
Move your feet! Move your feet!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

707
00:55:24,824 --> 00:55:26,659
Go. There you go.

708
00:55:26,826 --> 00:55:29,621
Get on the tackle!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

709
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:32,207
Come on, Michael!

710
00:55:56,439 --> 00:55:57,482
Mrs. Tuohy?

711
00:55:57,565 --> 00:56:01,111
I hear "Mrs. Tuohy" I look over my
shoulder for my mother-in-law.

712
00:56:01,194 --> 00:56:04,656
Call me Leigh Anne or Mama
or almost anything else.

713
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:10,370
- Can you help me get something?
- What?

714
00:56:12,747 --> 00:56:14,582
Driver's licence.

715
00:56:15,917 --> 00:56:20,171
Why do you need a driver's licence
when you don't even have a car?

716
00:56:26,636 --> 00:56:29,723
Michael, why do yo want
a driver's licence?

717
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:32,851
Something to carry.
With my name on it.

718
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:42,569
There's nobody named
Michael Oher in the system.

719
00:56:42,652 --> 00:56:44,988
Another last name perhaps?

720
00:56:47,365 --> 00:56:50,118
Look, I will sign something
that says he lives with us

721
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:53,830
and we'll pay for all the insurence;
whatever it takes, okay?

722
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:55,498
What's it gonna take?

723
00:56:55,582 --> 00:56:58,376
- You wanna do what?!
- You heard me.

724
00:56:58,543 --> 00:57:01,713
- Shouldn't we at least talk about this?
- What do you think we're doing?

725
00:57:01,796 --> 00:57:04,090
And don't act like I'm going
behind your back.

726
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:07,886
I know you put us down as Michael's
medical contact at school.

727
00:57:07,969 --> 00:57:11,014
There's a huge difference between
paying for broken arm

728
00:57:11,097 --> 00:57:12,932
and being legally responsible
for someone.

729
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:14,934
I mean the kid we barly know.

730
00:57:15,018 --> 00:57:18,271
That's another thing. We need
to find out more about his past.

731
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:20,357
He won't talk about it.
He's like an onion,

732
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,400
you have to peel him back
a layer at a time.

733
00:57:22,484 --> 00:57:24,652
Not if you use a knife.

734
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:28,948
What if we took him to a child
psychologist or something?

735
00:57:29,032 --> 00:57:31,576
- Do you really expect Big Mike---
- "Michael"

736
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:34,996
You really expect Michael to lie down
on a coach and talk about his childhood

737
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,373
like he's Woody Allen or something?

738
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:39,209
I mean, Michael's gift
is his ability to forget.

739
00:57:39,292 --> 00:57:43,755
He's mad at no one and he really
didn't care what happened in the past.

740
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:45,715
You're right.

741
00:57:45,924 --> 00:57:47,425
Excuse me?

742
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:49,094
"You're right?"

743
00:57:49,177 --> 00:57:51,805
How'd those words taste
coming out of your mouth?

744
00:57:51,888 --> 00:57:53,515
Like vinegar.

745
00:58:02,232 --> 00:58:04,943
At least promise me you'll think about it.

746
00:58:05,026 --> 00:58:06,528
Alright.

747
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:10,907
"Alright" you'll think about it or
"alright" we should do it?

748
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:13,076
Is there a difference?

749
00:58:15,537 --> 00:58:19,874
Just tell Gerald to hold on the chiffonier
and I'll get by after while.

750
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:24,212
You don't...
I got to call you back. Bye.

751
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:28,383
Excuse me.

752
00:58:29,926 --> 00:58:33,304
I'm not cutting, I'm just asking.
Let me tell you something, alright?

753
00:58:33,388 --> 00:58:35,432
We've been sitting around here
for over an hour

754
00:58:35,515 --> 00:58:37,225
and when i look around
and all I see

755
00:58:37,308 --> 00:58:39,936
is people shooting the bull
and drinking coffee.

756
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,980
Who runs this place?

757
00:58:44,691 --> 00:58:47,068
Well, I'd have it in shape in two days,
I can tell you that.

758
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:49,154
I'd bet you would.
How can I help you?

759
00:58:49,237 --> 00:58:51,406
- Oh, he was first.
- No, you go ahead.

760
00:58:51,489 --> 00:58:53,867
- I think I want to hear this
- Me too.

761
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,577
I do not appreciate
the attitude.

762
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:58,621
Ma'am,
now you can tell me what you want

763
00:58:58,872 --> 00:59:01,082
or I'll make sure you wait all day.

764
00:59:01,166 --> 00:59:03,084
Now how can I help you?

765
00:59:03,168 --> 00:59:05,170
I'd like to become
a legal guardian.

766
00:59:05,253 --> 00:59:07,297
Lord help that child.

767
00:59:11,051 --> 00:59:15,263
There's very little on Michael.
Most of his files have been lost.

768
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:18,683
- What is in there?
- A few case notes.

769
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:23,688
This one describes an incident where
Officers forcibly removed Michael

770
00:59:23,772 --> 00:59:26,566
from Denise Oher's care
when Michael was seven.

771
00:59:26,649 --> 00:59:29,444
Quite a scene evidently.
They had to split up the kids.

772
00:59:29,527 --> 00:59:30,945
And it's far from the worst.

773
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:33,073
Where is she? His mother?

774
00:59:33,156 --> 00:59:37,577
Dunno, if you find her we got
a bunch more files we could add to.

775
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:41,956
- How many kids does she have?
- At least a dozen, probably.

776
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:44,417
If not more.
With her drug arrest record

777
00:59:44,501 --> 00:59:47,128
my guess would be
she can't even remember.

778
00:59:47,545 --> 00:59:49,297
May I see that?

779
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:56,262
So we'd need her permission, right?

780
00:59:56,346 --> 00:59:58,473
No. Michael is a ward of the state.

781
00:59:58,556 --> 01:00:01,768
Just apply and get a Judge
to sign off on it.

782
01:00:03,853 --> 01:00:08,024
So you would just give him away
without even telling his mother?

783
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:33,049
Mrs. Oher?

784
01:00:36,511 --> 01:00:37,971
Hi.

785
01:00:38,054 --> 01:00:39,556
Mrs. Oher?

786
01:00:41,182 --> 01:00:43,476
- You from the state?
- No.

787
01:00:44,644 --> 01:00:50,233
My name is Leigh Anne Tuohy
and your son Michael lives with me.

788
01:00:51,693 --> 01:00:53,403
And my family.

789
01:00:59,868 --> 01:01:02,787
How's my boy? How's big Mike?

790
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:05,915
He's fine. He's doing really well.

791
01:01:07,125 --> 01:01:09,544
We might have some wine
in the kitchen, if you...

792
01:01:09,627 --> 01:01:11,921
Oh, no, no, no.
That's really kind.

793
01:01:12,255 --> 01:01:14,341
When did you last see Michael?

794
01:01:15,633 --> 01:01:17,135
I don't know.

795
01:01:17,802 --> 01:01:20,930
How many foster kids you got
living with you?

796
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:26,144
Oh, I'm not a foster parent to Michael.
We were just helping him out.

797
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:29,856
- State don't pay you nothing?
- No.

798
01:01:30,315 --> 01:01:33,485
And you feed him?
You buy him clothes, too?

799
01:01:33,777 --> 01:01:37,197
Well, when I can find them in his size.

800
01:01:40,241 --> 01:01:42,577
You a fine Christian lady.

801
01:01:42,994 --> 01:01:44,496
Well I try to be.

802
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:49,125
This is all really nice
what you're doing,

803
01:01:49,209 --> 01:01:52,629
but don't be surprised if one day
you wake up and he gone.

804
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,299
- What do you mean?
- He's a "runner."

805
01:01:57,217 --> 01:02:00,804
That's what the state called him
after they took him from me.

806
01:02:02,555 --> 01:02:04,933
Every foster home they sent him to,

807
01:02:05,767 --> 01:02:09,145
he'd slip out the window at night
and come looking for me.

808
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:14,150
No matter where I was that boy would
come find me, take care of me.

809
01:02:16,277 --> 01:02:19,030
I've had some health problems.

810
01:02:21,157 --> 01:02:25,078
Mrs. Oher, was Michael born
under a different name?

811
01:02:26,121 --> 01:02:29,708
Proctor. That was his Daddy's last name.

812
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:33,586
- Where is he?
- Ain't seen him since he left.

813
01:02:34,295 --> 01:02:35,797
And when was that?

814
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:38,258
Week after was Mike born?

815
01:02:39,259 --> 01:02:41,845
Do you have his birth certificate?

816
01:02:49,394 --> 01:02:51,896
It's alright. I'll figure it out.

817
01:03:07,078 --> 01:03:09,789
Mrs. Oher, you'll always
be Michael's Mama.

818
01:03:14,127 --> 01:03:15,587
Would you like to see him?

819
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:18,506
No. Not this way.

820
01:03:21,801 --> 01:03:23,261
It's Williams.

821
01:03:25,638 --> 01:03:27,474
His last name's Williams.

822
01:03:29,809 --> 01:03:32,687
Couldn't even remember
who the boy's father is.

823
01:04:02,592 --> 01:04:05,428
The color is better, the graphic is bright.
It's awesome!

824
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:08,473
Michael, we have something
we'd like to ask you.

825
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:10,392
What?

826
01:04:11,309 --> 01:04:13,061
Leigh Anne and I, we...

827
01:04:13,687 --> 01:04:15,188
Well...

828
01:04:15,563 --> 01:04:18,149
We'd like to become your legal guardians.

829
01:04:18,233 --> 01:04:19,651
What's that mean?

830
01:04:19,734 --> 01:04:22,612
What it means is, that we want to know

831
01:04:22,779 --> 01:04:25,615
if you'd like to become
a part of this family?

832
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:37,043
I kinda thought I already was.

833
01:04:45,719 --> 01:04:47,804
Well alright then.

834
01:04:56,021 --> 01:04:57,480
Right here.

835
01:05:01,443 --> 01:05:02,819
We got a couple of steps.

836
01:05:02,902 --> 01:05:05,155
- Watch your big foot.
- One more.

837
01:05:06,031 --> 01:05:08,074
One more. There we go.

838
01:05:09,659 --> 01:05:11,661
Alright. Take off the belt.

839
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:18,793
Well, that's the one you want it,
didn't it?

840
01:05:20,795 --> 01:05:23,923
Here. Here you go.
Go ahead. Take it for a ride. Go.

841
01:05:24,341 --> 01:05:25,550
- Can I go too?
- Yeah.

842
01:05:25,633 --> 01:05:27,510
Michael? Be careful.

843
01:05:27,594 --> 01:05:29,596
xxx

844
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:35,769
- He wanted a truck?!
- Michael thinks he's a redneck.

845
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:37,520
Come on, Michael!

846
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,442
Okay. See, you're the ketchup, here
at Left Tackle. On the weakside.

847
01:05:42,525 --> 01:05:44,652
The fist play is simple. "Gap."

848
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:51,618
Now, see, dishes means you're going
to block whoever is in front of you,

849
01:05:51,701 --> 01:05:54,913
or on your inside shoulder if you're not
covered by a defender.

850
01:05:54,996 --> 01:05:58,750
Now, I'll be the running back and you
show me what you're supposed to do.

851
01:05:58,833 --> 01:06:00,335
Ready.... Hike!

852
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:03,296
You block him, you hit him,

853
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:06,716
quarterback will hand it off,
he gets the ball and...

854
01:06:06,925 --> 01:06:09,636
Open lane to the end zone.
All there is to it.

855
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:11,554
What's going on here?!

856
01:06:11,805 --> 01:06:13,473
Player Spice just scored.

857
01:06:13,556 --> 01:06:16,476
We're going through the playbook.
Michael got move to offense.

858
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,396
Yeah. Well, when you're done, please,
put the players back in the spice cabinet.

859
01:06:19,479 --> 01:06:21,314
- Thank you.
- No problem.

860
01:06:22,107 --> 01:06:25,276
Oh, actually, Mom, we were
kinda waiting for you.

861
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:30,281
You see, the new Madden game came out
and me and Michael wanted to go get it.

862
01:06:30,448 --> 01:06:32,075
I can't, baby. I've got a meeting
in ten minutes

863
01:06:32,158 --> 01:06:33,618
But he can drive!

864
01:06:34,369 --> 01:06:36,079
He can drive us.

865
01:06:38,206 --> 01:06:40,750
Oh, yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.

866
01:06:40,834 --> 01:06:43,086
- What do you know about this?
- I already know all about this!

867
01:06:43,169 --> 01:06:45,463
- Alright, show me something.
- I'll tell you something, alright?

868
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:47,757
I'll start it. Follow my leads.

869
01:06:47,966 --> 01:06:49,259
- Ready?
- Yes.

870
01:06:49,426 --> 01:06:51,386
# Next days function,
high class luncheon #

871
01:06:51,469 --> 01:06:53,388
# Food is served
and you're stone cold munchin' #

872
01:06:53,471 --> 01:06:55,223
# Music comes on,
people start to dance #

873
01:06:55,306 --> 01:06:57,267
# But then you ate so much
you nearly split your pants #

874
01:06:57,350 --> 01:06:59,561
# A girl starts walkin,
guys start gawkin' #

875
01:06:59,644 --> 01:07:01,479
# Sits down next to you
and starts talkin' #

876
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:03,398
# Says she wanna dance
cus she likes the groove #

877
01:07:03,481 --> 01:07:05,942
# So come on fatso
and just bust a move #

878
01:07:06,026 --> 01:07:09,529
# If you want it, you've got it #

879
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,533
# if you want it baby you got it #

880
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:17,912
# If you want it, you've got it #

881
01:07:18,496 --> 01:07:21,583
# if you want it baby you got it #

882
01:07:26,004 --> 01:07:28,965
This is not a 40.000 dollar Oushak,
Omeed.

883
01:07:29,049 --> 01:07:30,592
You're crazy, Leigh Anne!

884
01:07:30,675 --> 01:07:33,928
The borders have different width.
They've been altered.

885
01:07:34,012 --> 01:07:36,765
We'll give you seventeen tops, alright?

886
01:07:36,973 --> 01:07:38,558
Hello?

887
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:43,855
Hey, hey, ma'am.
Ma'am, we check it.

888
01:07:43,938 --> 01:07:46,399
Those are my kids. Those are my kids!

889
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:50,195
Oh my God!

890
01:07:50,737 --> 01:07:51,780
- It will be okay.
- Where are they?

891
01:07:51,863 --> 01:07:53,281
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry.
Oh my God!

892
01:07:53,365 --> 01:07:55,116
- Michael, you okay?
- I'm fine. SJ!

893
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:57,744
- Michael, you're alright?
- Go help SJ!

894
01:07:58,286 --> 01:08:00,455
I'm so sorry - so sorry!

895
01:08:03,208 --> 01:08:04,542
Excuse me, ma'am?

896
01:08:04,626 --> 01:08:06,086
SJ! SJ!

897
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,880
- Mom?
- Yes, baby?

898
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:12,092
Do you think the blood will come
out of my shirt?

899
01:08:12,926 --> 01:08:16,012
Yes, I think the blood will come
out of your shirt.

900
01:08:16,346 --> 01:08:18,598
Ma'am, an airbag deploys
at 200 miles an hour.

901
01:08:18,682 --> 01:08:20,308
Your son's too small to sit
in the front seat.

902
01:08:20,392 --> 01:08:22,185
But he's okay, right?

903
01:08:22,394 --> 01:08:23,728
Busted lip, bruised face.

904
01:08:23,812 --> 01:08:25,772
Usually when someone his size
gets the airbag

905
01:08:25,855 --> 01:08:28,191
it's fractured faces, a broken neck.

906
01:08:28,274 --> 01:08:29,484
Maybe worse.

907
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:33,029
Like the air bag was coming at him
then changed direction.

908
01:08:33,154 --> 01:08:35,657
Quiet defective or something like that.

909
01:08:35,740 --> 01:08:37,742
Your son's very, very lucky.

910
01:08:37,909 --> 01:08:41,162
No idea. I called the insurence.
He's fine. He's fine!

911
01:08:41,579 --> 01:08:44,165
I'll talk to you later.
I got to go. Bye.

912
01:08:47,335 --> 01:08:49,295
SJ's fine.

913
01:08:50,338 --> 01:08:54,509
He is. He's actually enjoying all
the attention he's getting back there.

914
01:08:56,261 --> 01:09:00,181
Hey, Michael. Could happen to anyone,
alright? It's not your fault.

915
01:09:01,474 --> 01:09:03,059
Honey, look at me.

916
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:11,568
Michael, what happened to your arm?

917
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:15,030
I stopped it.

918
01:09:33,256 --> 01:09:34,883
Let's go!

919
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,682
Oher! You've got a hundred pounds
on Collis

920
01:09:42,766 --> 01:09:45,060
and you can't keep him out
of our backfield?!

921
01:09:45,143 --> 01:09:48,063
Hold your block until the whistle blow.
Hold it!

922
01:09:48,146 --> 01:09:49,647
Alright, let's go!

923
01:09:50,565 --> 01:09:51,941
What's with the camera?

924
01:09:52,025 --> 01:09:56,154
Michael always does better when he sees
what he's supposed to be doing.

925
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:05,330
- Holding ... Left tackle.
- Michael! Come on!

926
01:10:05,955 --> 01:10:08,583
Oher? Come here, son.

927
01:10:10,168 --> 01:10:14,255
You got to hold it. Hold it inside here,
between the tits. You got it?!

928
01:10:14,547 --> 01:10:16,091
Would you look at me, son.

929
01:10:16,174 --> 01:10:20,011
If you grab 'em outside here like this
without horse colour thing, you just did,

930
01:10:20,095 --> 01:10:23,223
we're going to get flagged and
I'm gonna get pissed. You hear me?

931
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:25,058
Alright, let's go!

932
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:28,478
Baby, watch my stuff, alright?

933
01:10:29,104 --> 01:10:30,438
Okay.

934
01:10:32,232 --> 01:10:34,943
Well at least he'll look good
coming off the bus.

935
01:10:35,026 --> 01:10:38,488
They'll be terrified 'til they realize
he's a marshmallow.

936
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:43,535
Looks like Tarzan, plays like Jane.

937
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:47,455
Gimme a minute, Bert.

938
01:10:47,706 --> 01:10:49,165
We're in the middle of practice,
Leigh Anne!

939
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:51,001
You can thank me later.

940
01:10:51,793 --> 01:10:52,877
Come.

941
01:10:53,586 --> 01:10:54,921
Michael,

942
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:56,339
do you remember
when we first met

943
01:10:56,423 --> 01:10:59,467
we went to that horrible part of town
to buy those dreadful clothes?

944
01:10:59,551 --> 01:11:01,678
And I was a little bit scared
and you told me not to worry about,

945
01:11:01,761 --> 01:11:03,596
because you had my back.
Do you remember that?

946
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,431
Yes, ma'am.

947
01:11:04,514 --> 01:11:08,601
And If anyone tried to get to me,
you would have stopped them, alright?

948
01:11:08,685 --> 01:11:10,562
And when you and SJ were
in that car wreck,

949
01:11:10,645 --> 01:11:12,814
what did you do to that airbag?

950
01:11:13,523 --> 01:11:15,567
- I stopped it.
- You stopped it.

951
01:11:15,650 --> 01:11:17,444
You stopped it.

952
01:11:17,902 --> 01:11:19,738
This team is your family, Michael.

953
01:11:19,821 --> 01:11:22,032
You have to protect them
from those guys.

954
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:23,491
Okay? Listen.

955
01:11:25,952 --> 01:11:26,870
Okay.

956
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:30,206
Tony here is your quarterback, alright?
You protect his blind side.

957
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:32,208
When you look at him,
you think of me.

958
01:11:32,292 --> 01:11:34,878
How you had my back.
How you have his.

959
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:37,213
Okay? Alright. Tony, go back.

960
01:11:39,341 --> 01:11:40,383
Alright.

961
01:11:40,925 --> 01:11:42,719
Oomaloompah here is your tailback.

962
01:11:42,802 --> 01:11:44,471
When you look at him,
you think of SJ,

963
01:11:44,554 --> 01:11:46,514
how you never let anyone
or anything to hurt him.

964
01:11:46,598 --> 01:11:48,099
You understand me?

965
01:11:48,516 --> 01:11:50,185
Alright. Go back.

966
01:11:51,102 --> 01:11:53,730
- You got it?
- What about Collins and Mr. Tuohy?

967
01:11:53,813 --> 01:11:55,857
Fine. They can be on the team too.

968
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:58,610
Are you gonna protect
the family, Michael?

969
01:11:58,735 --> 01:11:59,652
Yes, ma'am.

970
01:11:59,736 --> 01:12:01,946
Good boy. Now, go have some fun.

971
01:12:08,203 --> 01:12:11,414
Yelling at him doesn't work, Bert.
Doesn't trust men.

972
01:12:11,539 --> 01:12:15,335
In his experience they pretend
to care about 'til they disappear.

973
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:23,635
Wanna little play?

974
01:12:26,346 --> 01:12:28,556
SJ, you're gonna wanna get this.

975
01:12:28,765 --> 01:12:29,808
Okay.

976
01:12:32,268 --> 01:12:33,687
Come on, Mike!

977
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:50,829
Alright. Michael! Come on!

978
01:12:59,879 --> 01:13:02,799
- Yes! Michael!
- Alright! Way to go!

979
01:13:12,434 --> 01:13:13,643
Yes!

980
01:13:17,105 --> 01:13:18,565
Good boy.

981
01:13:29,701 --> 01:13:32,579
Okay. What'd you say to him?

982
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:35,540
Should get to know your players, Bert.

983
01:13:35,623 --> 01:13:39,252
He tested 98 percent
in protective instincts.

984
01:13:41,713 --> 01:13:43,923
I said you could thank me later.

985
01:13:45,091 --> 01:13:46,634
It's later, Bert.

986
01:13:58,813 --> 01:14:01,232
So much for home field advantage.

987
01:14:01,358 --> 01:14:03,818
You ever seen so many
Rednecks in one place?

988
01:14:03,902 --> 01:14:06,112
Nascar, not even close.

989
01:14:09,032 --> 01:14:12,243
Crusaders! Get Ready for
forty eight minutes of Hell!

990
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:14,120
You have fat ass.

991
01:14:16,164 --> 01:14:17,540
Hey, back on the field.

992
01:14:17,624 --> 01:14:19,542
Let me go. Hold on.
Listen up! Listen up!

993
01:14:19,626 --> 01:14:22,879
Don't let 'em get inside your head.
Now, keep your focus.

994
01:14:22,962 --> 01:14:24,047
- You ready?
- "Yeah"

995
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:26,007
- Alright. Let's go!
- "Go"

996
01:14:29,386 --> 01:14:31,554
- Come on!
- Michael!

997
01:14:32,722 --> 01:14:34,307
Damn, that ain't fair!

998
01:14:34,391 --> 01:14:36,559
They got big ole' black
bear playing for 'em!

999
01:14:36,643 --> 01:14:38,895
- What is this, a circus?
- Right.

1000
01:14:39,604 --> 01:14:42,023
Eyes forward, SJ! Sticks and stones.

1001
01:14:42,148 --> 01:14:44,275
Sticks and stones! Come on!

1002
01:15:03,753 --> 01:15:06,673
- Alright!
- Alright! Good start!

1003
01:15:11,928 --> 01:15:13,930
Let's go O! Let's go!

1004
01:15:14,472 --> 01:15:17,600
Here we go. Look at this big bull
we got right here.

1005
01:15:18,059 --> 01:15:20,353
Coming after you!
Coming after you!

1006
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:22,647
All night. All night.

1007
01:15:32,407 --> 01:15:35,285
Don't let him get through, Oher!
Come on, son!

1008
01:15:35,952 --> 01:15:40,206
Boy! All night long, fat ass!
All night long!

1009
01:15:40,331 --> 01:15:43,043
I got you, boy. All night long!

1010
01:15:44,919 --> 01:15:46,629
That's my boy!

1011
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:49,257
- It's alright, Michael!
- It's alright. Come on!

1012
01:15:49,341 --> 01:15:51,634
- Let's go!
- Take it off. Come on!

1013
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:57,724
Here we go! Round two, baby! Round two!

1014
01:16:02,562 --> 01:16:05,440
- Switch! Switch!
- Get it! Get it! Get it! Go!

1015
01:16:13,573 --> 01:16:15,950
Oher, don't let them get
the inside gap zone!

1016
01:16:16,034 --> 01:16:19,454
- Come on! Use your head!
- What is Bert doing? Nothing.

1017
01:16:22,207 --> 01:16:24,417
Hey, fat boy. We're not done yet.

1018
01:16:24,501 --> 01:16:27,253
All game long, boy! All game long!

1019
01:16:27,462 --> 01:16:28,922
Alright. Alright.

1020
01:16:30,548 --> 01:16:31,675
Go!

1021
01:16:33,301 --> 01:16:34,969
Pass! Pass! Pass!

1022
01:16:36,304 --> 01:16:37,681
Stop! Oh!

1023
01:16:41,559 --> 01:16:43,311
Why another pass, Bert?

1024
01:16:43,436 --> 01:16:45,480
Hey! Where you going, fat boy?

1025
01:16:45,563 --> 01:16:47,023
Better stay out of my field.

1026
01:16:47,107 --> 01:16:49,818
You are not welcome here!
This is my field!

1027
01:16:49,901 --> 01:16:52,112
Sixty six, get beck to your own bank.

1028
01:16:52,195 --> 01:16:54,781
Bert!
Be quiet! Bert!

1029
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:04,833
- Hello?
- Umm...

1030
01:17:04,916 --> 01:17:08,211
Enough with the trick plays, Bert.
Run the dang ball.

1031
01:17:09,921 --> 01:17:13,091
You heard it. Run the dang ball.
Run it.

1032
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:16,094
Wait a minute, did he just
hanged up the phone?

1033
01:17:16,177 --> 01:17:19,556
- No, I think he lost service.
- He did not lose service.

1034
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:23,143
That's my boy, Jimmy! Number 66!

1035
01:17:23,393 --> 01:17:25,603
Kicking that blue guy's ass.

1036
01:17:27,522 --> 01:17:29,315
Hey crotch mouth!

1037
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,026
Yeah, you!

1038
01:17:31,109 --> 01:17:33,903
Zip it or I'll come up there
zip it for ya!

1039
01:17:37,032 --> 01:17:38,074
Sticks and stones?

1040
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:40,577
You know what, SJ?
Just turn forward.

1041
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:43,621
Just take up the camera and keep shoot.
Come on.

1042
01:17:52,881 --> 01:17:54,424
Lock it!

1043
01:17:59,637 --> 01:18:02,432
It's alright. Alright. Alright.
We come back.

1044
01:18:21,409 --> 01:18:22,160
Go!

1045
01:18:26,206 --> 01:18:28,458
Come on! Get him!

1046
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:30,460
Gone. He's gone.

1047
01:18:35,548 --> 01:18:37,467
We got to shut xxx

1048
01:18:39,844 --> 01:18:44,057
Unbelievable. Three plays. Three plays.
Where were we... 4.3?

1049
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:45,350
Come on.

1050
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:53,108
Baby, me and you. Me and you, baby.
One more time.

1051
01:18:53,191 --> 01:18:54,484
Here we go!

1052
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:13,503
Alright, we got to cut back!
We got to cut back!

1053
01:19:13,586 --> 01:19:14,963
Come on. Let's go!

1054
01:19:15,046 --> 01:19:16,673
Black piece of crap!

1055
01:19:16,756 --> 01:19:18,174
Hey! Hey!

1056
01:19:18,383 --> 01:19:20,468
Raf! Are you gonna do
something about this?!

1057
01:19:20,552 --> 01:19:23,555
He just kicked my boy in the head
and cussed him!

1058
01:19:24,014 --> 01:19:25,348
Thank you!

1059
01:19:25,724 --> 01:19:29,144
Unsportsmanlike conduct... Wingate!
Fifteen yards!

1060
01:19:29,227 --> 01:19:29,978
What?!

1061
01:19:30,061 --> 01:19:32,814
You shut up, or you'll get another fifteen.

1062
01:19:35,483 --> 01:19:38,611
This young man plays for my team.
My team!

1063
01:19:39,029 --> 01:19:41,990
And I will defend him like he's my own son.

1064
01:19:42,073 --> 01:19:46,077
Against you or any other
redneck sonofabitch!

1065
01:19:48,038 --> 01:19:50,415
Don't worry, Coach.
I got your back.

1066
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:52,584
Alright then.

1067
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:02,510
Come here, son. Come here.

1068
01:20:03,053 --> 01:20:04,220
Try "Gap."

1069
01:20:04,471 --> 01:20:05,889
- "Gap?"
- "Gap."

1070
01:20:07,265 --> 01:20:11,311
Alright, gun rip, 47 Gap, on and on.
Ready?

1071
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:20,070
Coach ain't here to protect you now,
is he?

1072
01:20:27,243 --> 01:20:28,870
Ready!

1073
01:20:30,288 --> 01:20:32,332
{y:i}Team is your family, Michael.

1074
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:39,297
Go!

1075
01:20:45,303 --> 01:20:47,514
Go back, go back!
Block them all!

1076
01:20:47,889 --> 01:20:50,141
We got to hold! We got to hold!

1077
01:20:50,850 --> 01:20:52,352
Oh god!

1078
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:55,480
- Run, Michael!
- SJ!

1079
01:20:55,772 --> 01:20:57,273
- Michael!
- Run, Michael! Run!

1080
01:20:57,357 --> 01:20:58,441
Go!

1081
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,322
- Go, Mike!
- Go, Michael.

1082
01:21:06,825 --> 01:21:08,368
Touchdown!

1083
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:19,004
Yo! Deliverance! You see number 74?

1084
01:21:19,587 --> 01:21:21,172
Well, that's MY son.

1085
01:21:22,632 --> 01:21:25,552
- Way to go big bro!
- See, here's what we got it.

1086
01:21:25,635 --> 01:21:26,886
- Dead ball foul.
- Now what?!

1087
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:28,888
- Was he holding!
- No.

1088
01:21:29,305 --> 01:21:32,475
- Did he hit after the whistle?
- I don't believe so.

1089
01:21:33,268 --> 01:21:35,061
So what is the flag for?

1090
01:21:35,228 --> 01:21:37,564
I dunno...
Excessive blocking.

1091
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:40,817
You're kidding me.

1092
01:21:43,653 --> 01:21:46,656
Sorry, Coach.
I stopped when I heard the whistle.

1093
01:21:47,323 --> 01:21:49,117
Where were you taking him, Mike?

1094
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:52,287
To the bus.
That was the time for him to go home.

1095
01:21:54,706 --> 01:21:59,419
Attaboy, Michael Oher. Attaboy!
Go get 'em. Go get 'em, Crusaders!

1096
01:22:47,509 --> 01:22:51,012
Rub the heads! Rub the heads!
Alright! Let's go!

1097
01:22:56,643 --> 01:22:57,435
Go!

1098
01:22:59,270 --> 01:23:00,438
Stay!

1099
01:23:19,582 --> 01:23:22,419
Red, 41!
Red, 41!

1100
01:23:47,068 --> 01:23:49,529
Tom Lemming Recruiting,
please hold...

1101
01:23:49,696 --> 01:23:51,906
Tom Lemming Recruiting,
please hold....

1102
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:55,326
Coach Saban wants his monthly
recruitment update Fed Ex.

1103
01:23:55,493 --> 01:23:59,706
Does he really think getting it one day
early is gonna give LSU a leg up?

1104
01:24:00,498 --> 01:24:03,209
Hey, have you filled all the slots
for the Army All Star Game?

1105
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:04,461
Yeah, why?

1106
01:24:04,669 --> 01:24:06,838
You might want to open one up.

1107
01:24:45,043 --> 01:24:46,961
What did I tell you?

1108
01:24:55,929 --> 01:24:57,847
I want him.
I want him bad.

1109
01:24:58,973 --> 01:25:03,603
Y-E-L-L! Everybody yell!
Say, everybody yell!

1110
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:07,440
Y-E-L-L! Everybody yell!

1111
01:25:07,691 --> 01:25:10,193
Nice kick this time, Collins.
Nice job.

1112
01:25:10,944 --> 01:25:12,904
What in the world?

1113
01:25:13,196 --> 01:25:16,074
Alright. Y'all keep practicing.
Remember point your toes.

1114
01:25:16,157 --> 01:25:17,826
One, two, three, one!

1115
01:25:18,034 --> 01:25:19,786
One, two, three, two!

1116
01:25:19,869 --> 01:25:21,579
One, two, three, three!

1117
01:25:21,663 --> 01:25:23,748
You okay, son?

1118
01:25:24,374 --> 01:25:26,084
xxx

1119
01:25:26,292 --> 01:25:29,421
Shoot, man, Fulmer's here.
I might as well go home.

1120
01:25:29,504 --> 01:25:32,173
What to say, fellas?
How's doing your life?

1121
01:25:33,133 --> 01:25:35,427
I came all the way from Knoxville,
to see for myself.

1122
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:38,388
Hey, Coach.
We drove from Clemson, nine hours!

1123
01:25:38,805 --> 01:25:40,557
Coach Fulmer, it's a real honor.

1124
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:43,309
Coach Cotton, my pleasure. I watched
your program you've done really well.

1125
01:25:43,393 --> 01:25:46,396
I don't think there is any question
that you'll be at the next level soon.

1126
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:49,566
Oh, well, you know,
we do all we can, all we got.

1127
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:53,111
Is that Michael?
Is that O'Hair?

1128
01:25:53,403 --> 01:25:54,612
It's Oher.

1129
01:25:54,863 --> 01:25:56,948
Like a paddle in a boat. Oher.

1130
01:26:01,411 --> 01:26:03,413
You think we might see some drills?

1131
01:26:03,496 --> 01:26:05,498
Perhaps... I think all the Coaches
would appreciate it.

1132
01:26:05,582 --> 01:26:07,709
- Yeah?
- Oh, yes, sir. You bet.

1133
01:26:10,253 --> 01:26:12,547
Listen up, fellas! New board drill!

1134
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:15,383
Big Mike, Jay Collis.
Best on best. Right here.

1135
01:26:15,467 --> 01:26:17,427
Let's go! Come on! come on!

1136
01:26:25,185 --> 01:26:26,728
On my whistle, men!

1137
01:26:46,956 --> 01:26:48,375
Wow!

1138
01:26:54,798 --> 01:26:56,007
Coach, thank you.

1139
01:26:56,091 --> 01:26:58,802
- Where are you going, Coach?
- Back to South Carolina.

1140
01:26:58,885 --> 01:27:02,097
You tell to Michael Oher,
if he can qualify with his grades...

1141
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:03,223
Clemson wants him.

1142
01:27:03,306 --> 01:27:05,517
Yeah. Good luck with that, Brad!

1143
01:27:06,059 --> 01:27:08,103
Coach, you've done a great job
with this young man.

1144
01:27:08,186 --> 01:27:09,896
Oh, well he was little rough
when we first got him

1145
01:27:09,979 --> 01:27:12,899
but we, you know,
coached him up a little bit.

1146
01:27:23,535 --> 01:27:24,828
Hello, mom.

1147
01:27:24,911 --> 01:27:27,414
Did you know that to be eligible
for a Division One scholarship

1148
01:27:27,497 --> 01:27:30,500
Michael's gonna need
to make it a 2.5 GPA?

1149
01:27:31,418 --> 01:27:31,918
Really?

1150
01:27:32,002 --> 01:27:36,589
His ACT is low and I don't see him doing
any better if he retakes it right there.

1151
01:27:36,673 --> 01:27:40,093
- What's his GPA now?
- 1.76.

1152
01:27:40,802 --> 01:27:42,971
Oh, that's not too bad, when you
consider where he started.

1153
01:27:43,054 --> 01:27:45,515
He's gonna make it all A's this year.

1154
01:27:46,099 --> 01:27:49,477
I'm serious.
And that might not even be enough.

1155
01:27:49,811 --> 01:27:51,896
So he goes to Junior College?

1156
01:27:52,355 --> 01:27:54,941
Most inner city kids that go to JC
drop out in the first year.

1157
01:27:55,025 --> 01:27:57,360
His shot at the pros would go
out the window.

1158
01:27:57,444 --> 01:28:00,905
Pros? Are we even sure
he's gonna get college offers?

1159
01:28:04,075 --> 01:28:06,077
{y:i}Michael, Nick Saban from LSU.
(Louisiana State University)

1160
01:28:06,161 --> 01:28:08,913
{y:i}I'm looking forward to you're coming
down and visit us sometime.

1161
01:28:08,997 --> 01:28:12,042
{y:i}Gready. I'm Lou Holtz form
South Carolina. I'm call...

1162
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:16,171
{y:i}We're very interested in having Michael
over to Knoxville for a visit.

1163
01:28:16,838 --> 01:28:19,924
- Phil Fulmer, from Tennessee?
- There's twenty more among there.

1164
01:28:20,008 --> 01:28:22,677
And these things right here.
Fifty of 'em.

1165
01:28:22,802 --> 01:28:24,054
Any of those from Ole Miss?

1166
01:28:24,137 --> 01:28:27,349
No, they're not gonna start recruiting
until they hire a another coach.

1167
01:28:27,432 --> 01:28:30,810
Does make any difference
unless Michael makes his grades.

1168
01:28:33,313 --> 01:28:35,315
So, what are we going to do?

1169
01:28:35,857 --> 01:28:39,402
I understand you applied for
a teaching position at Wingate?

1170
01:28:40,236 --> 01:28:42,489
I won't religious enough for 'em.

1171
01:28:42,697 --> 01:28:48,203
I'm a spiritual person, Mrs. Tuohy, but
I have certain, shall we say... doubts.

1172
01:28:49,329 --> 01:28:51,664
Oh, I appreciate your honesty, Miss Sue.

1173
01:28:51,748 --> 01:28:54,959
- What's the situation with Michael?
- He needs to be better in school.

1174
01:28:55,043 --> 01:28:57,212
Obviously. Why the big push?

1175
01:28:57,504 --> 01:28:59,547
Well, he's in line for
football scholarship

1176
01:28:59,631 --> 01:29:01,549
if he gets his grades up.

1177
01:29:01,883 --> 01:29:04,803
- Is he considering Ole Miss?
- He'd better be.

1178
01:29:06,513 --> 01:29:10,141
- I'd love to work with him.
- Well, when'd you like to start?

1179
01:29:11,351 --> 01:29:15,146
Ms. Tuohy... Umm... There's something
you should know about me.

1180
01:29:15,438 --> 01:29:18,942
I don't usually tell many people, but
it's something I feel should be aware of

1181
01:29:19,025 --> 01:29:20,568
before you hire me.

1182
01:29:22,779 --> 01:29:24,322
What is it?

1183
01:29:24,698 --> 01:29:26,491
I 'm a Democrat.

1184
01:29:28,284 --> 01:29:29,786
Okay.

1185
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:37,502
- I don't understand it.
- Yet.

1186
01:29:37,794 --> 01:29:39,796
You don't understand it yet.

1187
01:29:42,007 --> 01:29:44,551
- How big is your head, Michael?
- Big.

1188
01:29:45,385 --> 01:29:46,886
And what's in there?

1189
01:29:46,970 --> 01:29:48,430
- A brain.
- A brain.

1190
01:29:48,513 --> 01:29:50,140
It's full of knowledge -

1191
01:29:50,223 --> 01:29:52,308
like a file cabinet with maps;

1192
01:29:53,018 --> 01:29:55,520
and shortcuts for figuring things out.

1193
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:57,439
You'll get there, Michael Oher

1194
01:29:57,522 --> 01:30:00,775
because I'm to help you use those maps
and reach your destination.

1195
01:30:00,859 --> 01:30:03,361
Like Sacagawea helped
Lewis and Clark.

1196
01:30:03,695 --> 01:30:04,863
Sacagawea?

1197
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:08,366
We'll get to that.
And the history books have it wrong,

1198
01:30:08,658 --> 01:30:11,786
All you need to know
is I'll get you there.

1199
01:30:12,871 --> 01:30:14,664
Do you believe me?

1200
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,419
You trust me, Michael?

1201
01:30:21,463 --> 01:30:22,839
Yes, Miss Sue.

1202
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:26,801
Try it again.

1203
01:30:28,136 --> 01:30:30,138
Now, what's the next one?
Read that to me.

1204
01:30:30,221 --> 01:30:33,558
Hey, what is it?
As first, we have to find the constant.

1205
01:30:34,017 --> 01:30:35,935
Now, where is the constant?

1206
01:30:36,144 --> 01:30:38,271
Good. See?

1207
01:30:38,521 --> 01:30:42,150
Who'd thought we'd have a black son
before we knew a Democrat.

1208
01:30:43,693 --> 01:30:46,738
- Doorbell!
- I got a guest.

1209
01:30:49,699 --> 01:30:51,117
Coach, how are you? Come in.

1210
01:30:51,201 --> 01:30:52,535
- Sean Tuohy.
- Sean.

1211
01:30:52,619 --> 01:30:54,496
- Nick Saban. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to see you. Pleasure.

1212
01:30:54,579 --> 01:30:57,248
I appreciate the opportunity
to come in your home.

1213
01:30:57,332 --> 01:30:59,584
- That's my daughter, Collins.
- Hi. Pleasure to meet you.

1214
01:30:59,668 --> 01:31:02,545
- And you must be Leigh Anne.
- That would be me, Coach Saban.

1215
01:31:02,629 --> 01:31:04,214
- Nice to meet you.
- Me too.

1216
01:31:04,297 --> 01:31:05,340
Please, call me Nick.

1217
01:31:05,423 --> 01:31:09,135
With an incredible home.
The windsor valances are a nice touch.

1218
01:31:09,552 --> 01:31:13,473
Oh, thank you. You obviously
have an excellent taste.

1219
01:31:13,556 --> 01:31:17,519
Well we appreciate the quality.
And recognize it when we see it.

1220
01:31:19,104 --> 01:31:20,980
Michael, why don't you come over here
and say hello to Coach Saban.

1221
01:31:21,064 --> 01:31:22,607
Hello, Michael. Nick Saban.

1222
01:31:22,691 --> 01:31:24,192
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1223
01:31:24,275 --> 01:31:26,486
- And you must be SJ.
- That's me.

1224
01:31:26,569 --> 01:31:30,323
Michael, why don't you and Nick
go into the living room to talk?

1225
01:31:30,407 --> 01:31:31,366
Can SJ come?

1226
01:31:31,449 --> 01:31:33,660
Absolutely.
We'll recruit the both of you.

1227
01:31:33,743 --> 01:31:35,120
Alright.

1228
01:31:37,622 --> 01:31:39,749
I find him extremely handsome.

1229
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,793
Yeah, I'm right here, Leigh Anne.

1230
01:31:41,876 --> 01:31:43,211
Yeah, I know.

1231
01:31:43,837 --> 01:31:46,715
So Michael, we'd like to
get you down to LSU for visit.

1232
01:31:46,798 --> 01:31:48,967
We've got a great thing going there
right now,

1233
01:31:49,050 --> 01:31:52,470
you have an opportunity to be
successful as a person, as a student,

1234
01:31:52,554 --> 01:31:57,017
and an opportunity to be a part of the next
National Championship team with LSU.

1235
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:00,103
So what do you say?
You'd like to commit to a visit?

1236
01:32:00,186 --> 01:32:02,105
- Can I ask a question?
- Sure.

1237
01:32:02,188 --> 01:32:04,190
My brother and I are very close.

1238
01:32:04,274 --> 01:32:08,153
And so... I'm very afraid that
if he goes off to school,

1239
01:32:08,611 --> 01:32:10,530
I might not get to see him.

1240
01:32:10,613 --> 01:32:12,157
- So ...
- Go on.

1241
01:32:12,449 --> 01:32:16,327
I guess I was just wondering how much
access I'd have to him.

1242
01:32:16,619 --> 01:32:18,997
Well, SJ, you'd have total access
to Michael.

1243
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:22,375
But better than that, in his first game
at Tiger stadium,

1244
01:32:22,459 --> 01:32:25,253
we would like for you to lead
the team out of the tunnel.

1245
01:32:25,337 --> 01:32:28,173
- What do you think about that?
- Sounds good.

1246
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,646
Come on in!

1247
01:32:43,730 --> 01:32:46,941
Gready. I'm Lou Holtz.
The University of South Carolina.

1248
01:32:47,025 --> 01:32:49,944
Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you.
Come on in. Michael!

1249
01:32:50,028 --> 01:32:52,280
Hello. I'm Tommy Tuberville.
Albany University.

1250
01:32:52,364 --> 01:32:54,616
Leigh Anne Tuohy. Nice to meet you.
Michael!

1251
01:32:54,699 --> 01:32:56,618
Howdy, Houston Nutt.
University of Arkansas.

1252
01:32:56,701 --> 01:32:58,286
Leigh Anne Tuohy.
Very nice to meet you.

1253
01:32:58,370 --> 01:33:01,039
- Ole Miss Cup, huh?
- Michael!

1254
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:05,168
Oh, come on. You know this.

1255
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:06,961
It's logical.

1256
01:33:18,598 --> 01:33:21,226
I guarantee you come to the
University of South Carolina

1257
01:33:21,309 --> 01:33:23,561
will be the smartest decision
you've ever made.

1258
01:33:23,645 --> 01:33:26,022
We want you, we need you,
but the other thing is,

1259
01:33:26,106 --> 01:33:27,607
Mike, you need us.

1260
01:33:32,195 --> 01:33:35,323
Knoxville is a tremendous place
to live and...

1261
01:33:35,657 --> 01:33:38,451
I know there's lions, there's tigers,
there's bears...

1262
01:33:38,535 --> 01:33:40,745
Hey, there's only one razorback
in the world.

1263
01:33:40,829 --> 01:33:44,749
...and not only that, you'd look great
in Gamecock Red!

1264
01:33:44,916 --> 01:33:46,042
What's in if for me?

1265
01:33:46,126 --> 01:33:49,671
SJ, I'd get you a hawkhat,
and for whole family a hawkhat.

1266
01:33:49,754 --> 01:33:52,215
Are you telling me,
that's the best you can do?

1267
01:33:52,298 --> 01:33:54,551
SJ, you remind me of me as a boy.

1268
01:33:54,843 --> 01:33:56,803
Coach, help me, help you.

1269
01:33:56,928 --> 01:34:00,849
I can get you a Gamecock headdress.
And with real feathers.

1270
01:34:09,482 --> 01:34:10,900
What you got for me, Phil?

1271
01:34:10,984 --> 01:34:13,778
SJ, I've been thinking a lot of
about that and one of the things

1272
01:34:13,862 --> 01:34:17,157
that think will be special for both
of us is we'll walk arm in arm

1273
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:19,659
to center of Union Stadium
at the first ball game,

1274
01:34:19,743 --> 01:34:21,578
and we'll do the coin toss together.

1275
01:34:21,661 --> 01:34:22,620
How's that sound?

1276
01:34:22,704 --> 01:34:24,998
Coach Fulmer, a pleasure doing
a business with you

1277
01:34:25,081 --> 01:34:28,001
My pleasure, SJ.
Could be sure, buddy.

1278
01:34:38,303 --> 01:34:40,096
Congratulations on gettin' hired.

1279
01:34:40,180 --> 01:34:42,891
Thank yew, Ma'am.
Ole Miss is my dream job.

1280
01:34:43,475 --> 01:34:46,227
You're coming a little late to the party
but we're diehard Rebels

1281
01:34:46,311 --> 01:34:48,229
so I'm gonna give you
a frickin' road map.

1282
01:34:48,313 --> 01:34:49,564
- Alright?
- Got it.

1283
01:34:49,647 --> 01:34:52,817
LSU is out. Everybody knows
Saban's going to the NFL.

1284
01:34:53,026 --> 01:34:55,779
I don't wanna name names, but on
Michael's first two recruitment trips

1285
01:34:55,862 --> 01:34:57,322
somebody took him to the tittybar.

1286
01:34:57,405 --> 01:34:59,240
- That's terrible.
- Tell me about it.

1287
01:34:59,324 --> 01:35:01,618
He'll have nightmares about for a weeks.
So when he comes to visit

1288
01:35:01,701 --> 01:35:04,287
I want you to feed him Italian -
he likes Fettucine Alfredo -

1289
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:07,749
and I want you to take him to a movie -
not Chainsaw Massacre

1290
01:35:07,832 --> 01:35:11,211
because he'll just cover his eyes -
and get him to bed by ten.

1291
01:35:11,294 --> 01:35:12,420
- You got it?
- Yes'm.

1292
01:35:12,504 --> 01:35:14,756
- Alright.
- What about Tennessee?

1293
01:35:15,507 --> 01:35:18,009
It breaks my heart but they're still
in the hunt.

1294
01:35:18,093 --> 01:35:19,928
Fulmer made SJ a sweet deal.

1295
01:35:20,011 --> 01:35:22,764
I heard the kid can really
pepper the gumbo.

1296
01:35:22,847 --> 01:35:24,516
He's his daddy's boy.

1297
01:35:24,849 --> 01:35:26,226
- You ready?
- Lets' do it.

1298
01:35:26,309 --> 01:35:27,435
Alright.

1299
01:35:27,602 --> 01:35:29,896
Mike, do you like to barbecue?
I tell you what, Mike.

1300
01:35:29,979 --> 01:35:32,399
You can go to the gas station
and get best barbecue,

1301
01:35:32,482 --> 01:35:33,942
you've ever got in your life.

1302
01:35:34,025 --> 01:35:36,611
It's a wonderful place to live,
fried catfishes,

1303
01:35:36,695 --> 01:35:38,363
all the good food
that we love to eat

1304
01:35:39,948 --> 01:35:42,242
you'd have to be aware, Mike.
I promise.

1305
01:35:42,325 --> 01:35:44,828
And for you, SJ,
this is what I can do.

1306
01:35:44,994 --> 01:35:46,996
At Ole Miss we have the Grove
by the stadium.

1307
01:35:47,080 --> 01:35:50,542
We walk it before every game,
in front of thousands of people.

1308
01:35:50,625 --> 01:35:53,044
It is a sacrad ritual. And I'm in front.

1309
01:35:53,128 --> 01:35:55,171
Seen it a thousand times.

1310
01:35:55,296 --> 01:35:56,881
Ever seen it from the front
of the line?

1311
01:35:56,965 --> 01:35:58,800
Next year, you and me;
leading the team.

1312
01:35:58,883 --> 01:36:02,554
Tennessee offered to let me run
on the field and flip the coin.

1313
01:36:06,016 --> 01:36:08,435
I'll throw in a sideline pass.

1314
01:36:18,361 --> 01:36:20,447
Have you decided yet, Michael?

1315
01:36:20,530 --> 01:36:22,240
No, Miss Sue.

1316
01:36:23,199 --> 01:36:25,577
But you like Tennessee?

1317
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:28,455
It's a good school.

1318
01:36:28,955 --> 01:36:30,665
Not at academic level of Ole Miss,

1319
01:36:30,749 --> 01:36:33,710
but they have an outstanding
science department.

1320
01:36:34,961 --> 01:36:37,172
You know what they're famous for?

1321
01:36:37,714 --> 01:36:39,716
They work with the FBI

1322
01:36:40,050 --> 01:36:43,678
to study the effects of the soil
on decomposing body parts.

1323
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:45,680
What's that mean?

1324
01:36:46,014 --> 01:36:49,392
Well when they find a body, the police
want to know how long it's been dead.

1325
01:36:49,476 --> 01:36:52,395
So the fine fox at Tennessee
help them out.

1326
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:55,607
They have a lot of body parts.

1327
01:36:56,399 --> 01:37:02,572
Arms and legs and hands -
form hospitals and medical schools.

1328
01:37:05,992 --> 01:37:08,370
And you know where they store them?

1329
01:37:11,831 --> 01:37:14,209
Right underneath the football field.

1330
01:37:16,127 --> 01:37:20,423
So, while it's fine and dandy,
there're 100,000 fans cheering for you,

1331
01:37:20,799 --> 01:37:24,844
the bodies, you should be worried about
are right underneath the turf.

1332
01:37:25,470 --> 01:37:28,390
Set to poke up through the ground
and grab you.

1333
01:37:33,561 --> 01:37:36,481
But it's your decision where you wanna
play ball.

1334
01:37:36,564 --> 01:37:38,525
Don't let me influence you.

1335
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:10,765
All the other teachers are on board,
I don't know, what your problem is.

1336
01:38:10,849 --> 01:38:11,766
I'm sorry.

1337
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:15,061
I will not give a student a grade
he, or she, doesn't deserve.

1338
01:38:15,145 --> 01:38:17,856
Well, Michael needs a B.

1339
01:38:18,606 --> 01:38:21,609
What is he have to do to "deserve" that?

1340
01:38:22,944 --> 01:38:26,114
Right now is Michael doing C minus,
D plus work.

1341
01:38:26,448 --> 01:38:28,742
His best chance at improving
is with the written essay

1342
01:38:28,825 --> 01:38:30,243
at the end of the year.

1343
01:38:30,326 --> 01:38:32,704
It counts a third of his grade.

1344
01:38:33,830 --> 01:38:35,790
Well that's it. We're sunk.

1345
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:40,628
Why don't you write about
"Great Expectations"?

1346
01:38:40,879 --> 01:38:42,714
You're a lot like Pip.

1347
01:38:42,922 --> 01:38:48,136
I mean he was poor, he was an orphan
and someone kind of found him.

1348
01:38:48,386 --> 01:38:50,805
You should be able to relate to that.

1349
01:38:54,601 --> 01:38:57,520
Fine, let's go through the reading list.

1350
01:38:57,604 --> 01:39:00,357
But you're gonna have to pick one, Michael.

1351
01:39:00,940 --> 01:39:02,233
"Pygmalion"...

1352
01:39:05,403 --> 01:39:09,199
"A Tale of Two Cities".....
"The Charge of the Light Brigade"...

1353
01:39:09,282 --> 01:39:12,452
"Half a league, half a league,
half a league onward"

1354
01:39:12,994 --> 01:39:14,662
I love that one.

1355
01:39:14,996 --> 01:39:16,581
He loves it.

1356
01:39:18,958 --> 01:39:22,128
Why don't you do this
and I'll watch basketball?

1357
01:39:26,132 --> 01:39:27,509
Okay.

1358
01:39:31,137 --> 01:39:34,182
"All in the Valley of Death rode
the six hundred."

1359
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:39,771
They named LSU's stadium Death Valley
because of this story.

1360
01:39:40,605 --> 01:39:44,109
Alfred, Lord Tennyson has writing
about LSU Ole Miss.

1361
01:39:44,275 --> 01:39:46,861
- You're kidding?
- No. It's a great story.

1362
01:39:46,945 --> 01:39:48,446
It's a poem.

1363
01:39:49,322 --> 01:39:51,324
"Forward the Light Brigade!"

1364
01:39:51,533 --> 01:39:53,118
It's like the offense.

1365
01:39:53,201 --> 01:39:55,370
"Charge for the guns he said."

1366
01:39:55,620 --> 01:39:57,247
That's the end zone.

1367
01:39:57,372 --> 01:39:59,749
"Into the Valley of Death rode
the six hundred."

1368
01:39:59,833 --> 01:40:01,793
"Forward the Light Brigade!

1369
01:40:02,002 --> 01:40:04,170
Was there a man dismay'd?

1370
01:40:04,337 --> 01:40:07,340
Not tho' the soldier knew
someone had blundered."

1371
01:40:08,008 --> 01:40:09,759
Someone made a mistake?

1372
01:40:10,051 --> 01:40:13,596
Yeah, their leader, their coach.

1373
01:40:16,057 --> 01:40:19,686
But why would they go ahead
if they knew he messed up?

1374
01:40:22,814 --> 01:40:27,027
"Theirs not to make reply,
theirs not to reason why,

1375
01:40:28,611 --> 01:40:30,613
theirs but to do and die:

1376
01:40:31,781 --> 01:40:34,701
Into the Valley of Death rode
the six hundred."

1377
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:40,040
They're all gonna die, aren't they?

1378
01:40:41,541 --> 01:40:42,584
Yeah.

1379
01:40:46,212 --> 01:40:48,465
That's really, really sad.

1380
01:40:52,093 --> 01:40:55,472
I think you just found something
to write about, Michael.

1381
01:41:11,279 --> 01:41:13,573
{y:i}Courage is a hard thing to figure.

1382
01:41:13,782 --> 01:41:17,535
{y:i}You can have courage based
on a dumb idea or mistake,

1383
01:41:17,994 --> 01:41:20,205
{y:i}but you're not supposed
to question adults,

1384
01:41:20,288 --> 01:41:22,707
{y:i}or your coach
or your teacher

1385
01:41:22,916 --> 01:41:24,918
{y:i}because they make the rules.

1386
01:41:25,543 --> 01:41:27,128
{y:i}Maybe they know best

1387
01:41:27,629 --> 01:41:29,631
{y:i}but maybe they don't.

1388
01:41:30,340 --> 01:41:33,426
{y:i}It all depends on who you are,
where you come from.

1389
01:41:34,594 --> 01:41:37,472
{y:i}Didn't at least one of the six hundred
guys think about giving up.

1390
01:41:37,555 --> 01:41:39,766
{y:i}and joining with the other side?

1391
01:41:39,974 --> 01:41:43,144
{y:i}I mean, Valley of Death
that's pretty salty stuff.

1392
01:41:46,231 --> 01:41:48,358
{y:i}That's why courage it's tricky.

1393
01:41:49,067 --> 01:41:51,986
{y:i}Should you always do
what others tell you to do?

1394
01:41:53,196 --> 01:41:56,324
{y:i}Sometimes you might not even know
why you're doing something.

1395
01:41:56,408 --> 01:41:58,827
{y:i}I mean any fool can have courage.

1396
01:41:59,911 --> 01:42:03,998
{y:i}But honor, that's the real reason
you either do something or you don't.

1397
01:42:04,457 --> 01:42:07,460
{y:i}It's who you are and maybe
who you want to be.

1398
01:42:08,837 --> 01:42:11,047
{y:i}If you die trying for
something important

1399
01:42:11,131 --> 01:42:13,508
{y:i}then you have both
honor and courage

1400
01:42:13,758 --> 01:42:15,802
{y:i}and that's pretty good.

1401
01:42:16,261 --> 01:42:18,596
{y:i}I think that's what the writer
was saying.

1402
01:42:18,680 --> 01:42:21,891
{y:i}That you should hope for courage
and try for honor.

1403
01:42:22,684 --> 01:42:26,938
{y:i}And maybe even pray that the people
telling you what to do have some, too.

1404
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:34,154
Kevin Lynn.

1405
01:42:38,992 --> 01:42:40,744
- Good job.
- Excuse me.

1406
01:42:43,246 --> 01:42:45,415
{y:i}Matthew Nicols.

1407
01:42:46,958 --> 01:42:48,710
2.52.

1408
01:42:50,003 --> 01:42:52,922
Michael's final GPA.
Got it off Paul's computer.

1409
01:42:53,006 --> 01:42:54,341
{y:i}Jamie North.

1410
01:42:54,466 --> 01:42:56,384
He did it, Sean. He did it!

1411
01:42:57,177 --> 01:43:00,388
Baby, you've been broken to
the principal's computer?

1412
01:43:02,182 --> 01:43:03,808
Michael Oher.

1413
01:43:11,066 --> 01:43:13,943
Where in the world did you find
a baby picture of Michael?

1414
01:43:14,027 --> 01:43:17,238
Scanned it off an Internet ad
for a toddler boutique.

1415
01:43:23,286 --> 01:43:25,163
Congratulations, Mike.

1416
01:43:41,471 --> 01:43:43,223
Michael, our greetings.

1417
01:43:46,434 --> 01:43:47,977
Way to go, bro!

1418
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:51,106
Alright, that's enough.
Young man...

1419
01:43:52,023 --> 01:43:54,067
I think I need a proper hug.

1420
01:43:58,571 --> 01:44:01,491
Alright. You're gonna be staying
in Deaton Hall - where is it?

1421
01:44:01,574 --> 01:44:04,369
109. It's right there.
And you're gonna be on a meal plan

1422
01:44:04,452 --> 01:44:06,788
so you're gonna be eating all the way
here in Johnson Commons. Right there.

1423
01:44:06,871 --> 01:44:09,416
Johnson Commons has all you
can eat self-serve ice cream.

1424
01:44:09,499 --> 01:44:10,625
As much as you want?

1425
01:44:10,709 --> 01:44:13,503
Yes, that's how Mama put
on her freshman ten.

1426
01:44:15,296 --> 01:44:16,297
Stop it!

1427
01:44:19,259 --> 01:44:20,510
Hello?

1428
01:44:22,595 --> 01:44:23,972
This is Mrs. Tuohy.

1429
01:44:24,055 --> 01:44:26,099
He just want ask you a couple
of questions,  Michael.

1430
01:44:26,182 --> 01:44:28,018
You have nothing to hide.

1431
01:44:29,310 --> 01:44:30,937
Ms. Tuohy? Mr. Oher?

1432
01:44:31,146 --> 01:44:33,023
My name is Jocelyn Granger,
and I'm the Assistant Director

1433
01:44:33,106 --> 01:44:34,858
of Enforcement for the NCAA.

1434
01:44:34,941 --> 01:44:36,943
Please, call me Leigh Anne.

1435
01:44:39,946 --> 01:44:41,614
So, let's do this. Shall we?

1436
01:44:41,698 --> 01:44:45,702
Ms. Tuohy, if you wouldn't mind
I'd prefer to speak with Michael alone.

1437
01:44:45,785 --> 01:44:48,538
- And how long is that gonna take?
- Awhile.

1438
01:44:50,999 --> 01:44:53,835
Go, Mike. Okay? Go.

1439
01:44:57,547 --> 01:45:01,301
Michael? Michael! I'll be waiting
for you in the lobby, alright?

1440
01:45:05,847 --> 01:45:09,434
I don't know, Sean. I just have
a bad feeling about this one.

1441
01:45:09,768 --> 01:45:12,479
This woman is tough, tough...
Hold on.

1442
01:45:13,355 --> 01:45:14,981
Hey.

1443
01:45:15,857 --> 01:45:18,026
The client wants what?

1444
01:45:18,610 --> 01:45:21,821
Were you aware that Coach Cotton
is accepting a job at Ole Miss?

1445
01:45:21,905 --> 01:45:22,822
No.

1446
01:45:22,906 --> 01:45:26,242
And that this job offer came after
you signed with them?

1447
01:45:27,035 --> 01:45:29,704
Sean Tuohy, your legal guardian
went to Ole Miss.

1448
01:45:29,788 --> 01:45:31,331
He played basketball.

1449
01:45:31,414 --> 01:45:33,917
And Mrs. Tuohy went to Ole Miss as well.

1450
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,710
She was a cheerleader.

1451
01:45:35,794 --> 01:45:38,338
Is this safe to say that Ole Miss
is their favorite school?

1452
01:45:38,421 --> 01:45:42,175
Did they like any other Universities?
What about, say Tennessee?

1453
01:45:42,467 --> 01:45:44,594
No. They can't stand Tennessee.

1454
01:45:46,137 --> 01:45:48,098
- And your tutor...
- Miss Sue.

1455
01:45:48,181 --> 01:45:51,434
Miss Sue.
Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad, too.

1456
01:45:53,228 --> 01:45:56,523
Miss Sue ever tried to persuade you
to attend Ole Miss?

1457
01:46:01,778 --> 01:46:04,989
Did you know that the Tuohys make
generous donations to Ole Miss?

1458
01:46:05,073 --> 01:46:07,742
That even Miss Sue makes donations?

1459
01:46:08,034 --> 01:46:10,203
That the Tuohys, they have
a condo in Oxford

1460
01:46:10,286 --> 01:46:13,415
so they can attend as many
athletic events as possible?

1461
01:46:13,498 --> 01:46:18,378
That, in fact, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy
are by our definition... "boosters."

1462
01:46:21,047 --> 01:46:22,549
Mr. Oher.

1463
01:46:23,174 --> 01:46:24,551
Mr. Oher?

1464
01:46:25,260 --> 01:46:28,179
Do you understand...
Do you know, why am I here?

1465
01:46:29,264 --> 01:46:31,099
To... investigate.

1466
01:46:31,182 --> 01:46:33,143
Yes. To investigate.

1467
01:46:34,144 --> 01:46:37,981
I'm here to investigate your odd...
predicament.

1468
01:46:39,065 --> 01:46:42,152
Do you find it odd?
Your predicament?

1469
01:46:44,529 --> 01:46:45,780
Michael?...

1470
01:46:46,906 --> 01:46:48,199
Iono.

1471
01:46:49,951 --> 01:46:51,619
Can I... can I leave now?

1472
01:46:51,703 --> 01:46:53,288
No. You can't.

1473
01:46:54,956 --> 01:46:57,042
- What do you want, ma'am?
- I want the facts!

1474
01:46:57,125 --> 01:46:58,835
- I need the truth.
- I didn't lie!

1475
01:46:58,918 --> 01:47:03,089
- And I want to know what you think
about all this. - THINK ABOUT WHAT?!

1476
01:47:11,556 --> 01:47:16,811
The NCAA fears that with your recruitment
a door might be opened -

1477
01:47:17,771 --> 01:47:19,773
that boosters from lots
of schools in the south

1478
01:47:19,856 --> 01:47:22,317
will become legal guardians for
young athletes without means

1479
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:24,819
and funnel them to their Alma Maters.

1480
01:47:25,737 --> 01:47:29,032
I'm not saying I believe it
and I'm not saying I don't,

1481
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:31,034
but there're many people
involved with this case

1482
01:47:31,117 --> 01:47:33,912
who would argue that Tuohys
they took you in,

1483
01:47:34,412 --> 01:47:36,539
- they clothes you, they fed you,
- No.

1484
01:47:36,623 --> 01:47:38,541
- they paid for your private education,
- No.

1485
01:47:38,625 --> 01:47:39,959
- they bought you a car,
- No!

1486
01:47:40,043 --> 01:47:41,628
- and paid for your tutor,
- No.

1487
01:47:41,711 --> 01:47:44,381
all as part of a plan to insure
that you play football

1488
01:47:44,464 --> 01:47:46,800
for the University of Mississippi.

1489
01:48:04,275 --> 01:48:06,861
Michael! We're not finished.

1490
01:48:07,696 --> 01:48:10,198
It's not available. Just like I told you
three months ago.

1491
01:48:10,281 --> 01:48:12,534
So why don't we go with the canvas.

1492
01:48:12,617 --> 01:48:15,954
The low napa, it's a beautiful---
Oh, I'll call you back. Bye.

1493
01:48:16,037 --> 01:48:17,914
Michael. So what happened?

1494
01:48:18,581 --> 01:48:21,042
- Why'd you do it?
- What?

1495
01:48:21,334 --> 01:48:23,795
All along you wanted me
to go to Ole Miss.

1496
01:48:23,878 --> 01:48:26,089
Of course, I did.
We love Ole Miss!

1497
01:48:26,172 --> 01:48:27,257
Why did you do this for me?

1498
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:28,842
- What?
- Everything!

1499
01:48:28,925 --> 01:48:31,136
Was it for you or was it for me?

1500
01:48:31,302 --> 01:48:34,305
Was it so I would go to school
where you wanted?!

1501
01:48:34,431 --> 01:48:36,683
Was it so i would do what you wanted?!

1502
01:48:36,766 --> 01:48:39,394
- Michael, no...
- That's what she thinks.

1503
01:48:39,894 --> 01:48:41,146
Is she right?

1504
01:48:41,688 --> 01:48:43,940
Michael, honey, I need for you
please, listen to me, alright?

1505
01:48:44,024 --> 01:48:46,026
Don't you dare to lie to me.

1506
01:48:49,154 --> 01:48:50,739
I'm not stupid!

1507
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:52,323
Michael?!

1508
01:48:52,407 --> 01:48:53,992
Michael, of course,
you're not stupid.

1509
01:48:54,075 --> 01:48:55,702
Michael?!
Come on.

1510
01:49:00,206 --> 01:49:02,042
I should have followed him.

1511
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:04,753
You had no way of knowing
he'd disappear.

1512
01:49:07,130 --> 01:49:08,840
Was he right?

1513
01:49:09,674 --> 01:49:11,509
What he said about us?

1514
01:49:11,676 --> 01:49:13,053
Leigh Anne, be reasonable.

1515
01:49:13,136 --> 01:49:15,430
We gave clothes to a boy
who had one pair of shorts.

1516
01:49:15,513 --> 01:49:17,223
We gave him a bed.

1517
01:49:17,515 --> 01:49:20,685
To hell with the NCAA,
I'd do it again tomorrow.

1518
01:49:20,894 --> 01:49:23,021
What about all the rest of it -

1519
01:49:23,563 --> 01:49:27,150
all the stuff we did to make sure
that he got a scholarship?

1520
01:49:27,942 --> 01:49:30,153
A scholarship at Ole Miss.

1521
01:49:30,528 --> 01:49:32,822
He could go whenever he wanted,
he knew that.

1522
01:49:32,906 --> 01:49:35,408
Oh, did he?
Did you ask him?

1523
01:49:36,117 --> 01:49:38,536
'Cause I sure as I know I never did.

1524
01:49:40,872 --> 01:49:42,082
Hey.

1525
01:49:42,832 --> 01:49:44,042
Come here.

1526
01:50:00,892 --> 01:50:06,398
Am I a good person?
Not a joke. Not rhetorical.

1527
01:50:09,401 --> 01:50:12,153
You're the best person I know.

1528
01:50:14,531 --> 01:50:17,075
Everything you do, you do for others.

1529
01:50:19,786 --> 01:50:21,579
And why is that?

1530
01:50:24,416 --> 01:50:26,209
I have not a clue.

1531
01:50:26,835 --> 01:50:31,047
But you obviously get some
sort of sick satisfaction out of it.

1532
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:39,097
- Sean...
- Yeah?

1533
01:50:40,265 --> 01:50:42,267
What if he never comes back?

1534
01:50:49,274 --> 01:50:50,775
Oh, shit!

1535
01:50:52,861 --> 01:50:56,698
Big Mike?
Hey, get your ass in here, man.

1536
01:50:56,865 --> 01:50:58,408
I'm looking for my Moms.

1537
01:50:58,491 --> 01:51:00,952
Your Mama?
Yeah, I seen Dee Dee around.

1538
01:51:01,953 --> 01:51:03,872
As a matter of fact...

1539
01:51:04,456 --> 01:51:07,959
Oh, yeah. She usually stop by for a taste
around this time.

1540
01:51:08,209 --> 01:51:10,587
But I tell you what.
Why don't you just come inside

1541
01:51:10,670 --> 01:51:14,257
I'll get you a forty and we're
gonna chop it up like real fo,

1542
01:51:14,507 --> 01:51:16,259
just 'til she get here.

1543
01:51:18,470 --> 01:51:21,097
Come on, man.
Nobody gonna bite you, man.

1544
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:33,860
Hey! Big Mike! Man, go down
xxx and have a seat.

1545
01:51:34,444 --> 01:51:36,071
Yeah, bitch!

1546
01:51:36,154 --> 01:51:38,323
Hey, baby, gimme a couple of cold beers
from the refrigerator!

1547
01:51:38,406 --> 01:51:39,783
Sit down, man. Big Mike.

1548
01:51:39,866 --> 01:51:42,035
- What?
- I'm so glad to see you.

1549
01:51:42,410 --> 01:51:45,205
Yeah. You lookin' good.
Too, you lookin' fit.

1550
01:51:45,580 --> 01:51:47,791
I heard you playin' little ball.

1551
01:51:48,291 --> 01:51:52,337
But you know that rich kid football
ain't like the public school league.

1552
01:51:52,420 --> 01:51:55,298
Niggers packing knives in their socks.

1553
01:51:56,257 --> 01:51:58,510
Hey, I played little ball myself.

1554
01:51:58,718 --> 01:52:01,012
Back in the day, you know that, alright?

1555
01:52:01,096 --> 01:52:02,097
Yeah, I heard.

1556
01:52:02,180 --> 01:52:04,891
A quarterback. Up there at MLK.

1557
01:52:07,268 --> 01:52:09,312
- Thank you, baby.
- What about you, Dave?

1558
01:52:09,396 --> 01:52:11,314
You still playing ball over at JC?

1559
01:52:11,398 --> 01:52:12,565
- Naw.
- No, man.

1560
01:52:12,649 --> 01:52:14,526
Dave no longer a student.

1561
01:52:14,818 --> 01:52:16,152
He with me now!

1562
01:52:16,319 --> 01:52:20,031
As a matter of fact...
Look, I can open a spot for you, too.

1563
01:52:20,365 --> 01:52:22,450
I got tired of going to class.

1564
01:52:22,617 --> 01:52:24,661
People are tryin' tell me what to do.

1565
01:52:24,744 --> 01:52:27,122
Well, in that case, Dave, look here...

1566
01:52:27,205 --> 01:52:29,874
Turn it up, like that
little bit of bitch!

1567
01:52:30,792 --> 01:52:32,127
Bitch!

1568
01:52:34,713 --> 01:52:37,257
Hey, man.
Don't mess with D, man.

1569
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:42,178
I heard you stayin' on
the other side of town.

1570
01:52:42,679 --> 01:52:45,890
Yeah, that what Dee Dee said.
Said you got a new Mama now.

1571
01:52:45,974 --> 01:52:47,851
- Yeah?
- Oh yeah!

1572
01:52:47,976 --> 01:52:50,145
- She fine too.
- Yeah. She fine.

1573
01:52:50,228 --> 01:52:51,730
xxx

1574
01:52:53,189 --> 01:52:54,816
She got other kids?

1575
01:52:57,569 --> 01:52:59,112
She got a daughter?

1576
01:53:01,197 --> 01:53:02,699
You tap that?

1577
01:53:06,411 --> 01:53:08,663
Yeah, you taped that!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1578
01:53:08,747 --> 01:53:09,372
Big Mike!

1579
01:53:09,456 --> 01:53:12,375
Big Mike got his white babes!

1580
01:53:13,626 --> 01:53:15,211
Hey, Big Mike!

1581
01:53:15,545 --> 01:53:17,589
You should enjoy 'em, man.

1582
01:53:17,756 --> 01:53:19,257
Hey, where you going?

1583
01:53:19,341 --> 01:53:21,885
Going to wait my mom
to the apartement.

1584
01:53:26,014 --> 01:53:27,724
Hey, man, just don't go away now.

1585
01:53:27,807 --> 01:53:28,850
Hey, sit down, man.

1586
01:53:28,933 --> 01:53:32,896
I'm just trying to find out little bit
about your fine white sister.

1587
01:53:32,979 --> 01:53:35,774
Because I like me some
mommy/daughter action.

1588
01:53:36,066 --> 01:53:37,567
Shut up.

1589
01:53:41,988 --> 01:53:45,450
Shut up? Who the hell is
you telling to shut up?

1590
01:53:49,329 --> 01:53:51,664
I will bust and cap your fat ass.

1591
01:53:51,956 --> 01:53:55,085
And then drive east and pay
a visit to your cracker Mom!

1592
01:53:55,168 --> 01:53:57,253
And her sweet little daughter.

1593
01:54:29,244 --> 01:54:30,453
MAMA!!!!!

1594
01:54:53,226 --> 01:54:55,603
He gone, snowflake.

1595
01:55:02,027 --> 01:55:03,486
Michael was here?

1596
01:55:03,570 --> 01:55:06,239
Yeah, but you tell him,
I'll be seeing him around.

1597
01:55:06,322 --> 01:55:08,116
Or he gonna get this.

1598
01:55:08,324 --> 01:55:09,951
So Michael was here?

1599
01:55:10,243 --> 01:55:13,413
Last night. He come by here.
Sneaked me then run off.

1600
01:55:13,788 --> 01:55:16,416
Yeah. Tell him, sleep with one eye open.

1601
01:55:17,959 --> 01:55:19,502
You hear me, bitch?

1602
01:55:25,550 --> 01:55:27,927
No, you hear me, bitch!

1603
01:55:28,762 --> 01:55:31,514
You threaten my son you threaten me.

1604
01:55:32,432 --> 01:55:35,769
You so much as cross downtown
you will be sorry.

1605
01:55:35,935 --> 01:55:39,397
I'm in a prayer group with the D.A.,
I'm a member of the NRA

1606
01:55:39,481 --> 01:55:41,232
and I'm always packing.

1607
01:55:46,196 --> 01:55:49,491
What you got in there, a .22?
A Saturday Night Special?

1608
01:55:51,701 --> 01:55:54,662
And it shoots just fine
all the other days, too.

1609
01:56:19,938 --> 01:56:21,898
- Michael?!
- Mama?...

1610
01:56:49,718 --> 01:56:52,595
You think the police is gonna come
and get me?

1611
01:56:53,054 --> 01:56:55,223
I'd imagine the last thing
they want at Hurt Village

1612
01:56:55,306 --> 01:56:57,559
is bunch of cops snooping around.

1613
01:57:01,229 --> 01:57:06,317
I swore I'd never ask this, but
how'd you get out of there, Michael?

1614
01:57:08,945 --> 01:57:12,032
When I was little and something
awful was happening

1615
01:57:12,657 --> 01:57:15,452
my Mama would tell me to close my eyes.

1616
01:57:15,660 --> 01:57:19,789
She was tryin' to keep me from seeing
her do drugs or other bad things.

1617
01:57:20,290 --> 01:57:23,251
And then when she was finished
or the bad things were over

1618
01:57:23,335 --> 01:57:28,006
she'd say, "now when I count
to three, you open your eyes

1619
01:57:29,090 --> 01:57:32,010
and the past is gone,
the world is a good place,

1620
01:57:32,218 --> 01:57:34,596
and it's all gonna be okay."

1621
01:57:37,182 --> 01:57:38,808
You closed your eyes.

1622
01:57:42,187 --> 01:57:46,566
You know, when I was driving all over
Kingdom Come looking for you

1623
01:57:46,816 --> 01:57:49,152
I kept thinking about one thing.

1624
01:57:50,570 --> 01:57:52,238
Ferdinand the bull.

1625
01:57:55,617 --> 01:57:58,995
I know I should have asked this
a long time ago, Michael.

1626
01:58:00,330 --> 01:58:02,749
Do you even wanna play football?

1627
01:58:03,667 --> 01:58:05,794
I mean do you even like it?

1628
01:58:07,087 --> 01:58:10,173
- I'm pretty good at it.
- Yeah, you are.

1629
01:58:13,301 --> 01:58:15,178
Sean and I have been talking and...

1630
01:58:15,261 --> 01:58:18,640
Michael, if you're gonna accept
the football scholarship

1631
01:58:19,724 --> 01:58:22,102
we think it should be to Tennessee.

1632
01:58:24,938 --> 01:58:29,984
And I promise that I will be at
every game cheering for you.

1633
01:58:30,985 --> 01:58:33,154
- Every game?
- Every game.

1634
01:58:34,906 --> 01:58:38,243
But I will not wear that gaudy orange.
I will not.

1635
01:58:38,326 --> 01:58:41,579
It is not in my color wheel
and I'm not gonna wear it.

1636
01:58:44,082 --> 01:58:46,459
So you want me to go to Tennessee?

1637
01:58:47,836 --> 01:58:50,755
I want you to do
whatever you want.

1638
01:58:51,464 --> 01:58:54,259
It is your decision, Michael.
It's your life.

1639
01:58:56,261 --> 01:58:58,471
What if I want to flip burgers?

1640
01:59:02,017 --> 01:59:04,936
It's your decision; it's your life.

1641
01:59:07,814 --> 01:59:08,982
Okay.

1642
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:12,193
Okay, what?

1643
01:59:14,696 --> 01:59:16,865
I'm sorry I left the other day.

1644
01:59:16,990 --> 01:59:20,160
- You were pretty upset.
- You ask a lot of questions.

1645
01:59:20,243 --> 01:59:21,828
I'm just trying to get
to the bottom of this.

1646
01:59:21,911 --> 01:59:25,165
But all questions you asked
were about why everybody else

1647
01:59:25,248 --> 01:59:27,167
wanted me to go to Ole Miss.

1648
01:59:27,250 --> 01:59:28,126
Okay...

1649
01:59:28,209 --> 01:59:31,171
Not once did you ask
why did I want to go there.

1650
01:59:33,089 --> 01:59:37,594
Alright, fine, Michael...
Why do you want to go to Ole Miss?

1651
01:59:38,303 --> 01:59:41,056
Because it's where my family
goes to school.

1652
01:59:42,015 --> 01:59:44,601
It's were they've always gone to school.

1653
01:59:51,816 --> 01:59:53,860
College is going to be different
experience for you, Michael.

1654
01:59:53,943 --> 01:59:55,195
SJ, stop it.

1655
01:59:55,278 --> 01:59:57,572
- There are lots of distractions.
- Have a fun.

1656
01:59:57,655 --> 02:00:02,077
There's gonna be some nimrod in the dorm
who wants to play video games all night,

1657
02:00:02,160 --> 02:00:04,037
or goof on the internet.

1658
02:00:04,120 --> 02:00:05,163
Just have fun.

1659
02:00:05,246 --> 02:00:08,249
And you will spend a lot of time
at practice, which means...

1660
02:00:08,333 --> 02:00:11,211
which means you have to be very
dedicated to your studies, alright?

1661
02:00:11,294 --> 02:00:12,837
SJ, if you don't stop it right---

1662
02:00:12,921 --> 02:00:13,672
- Come here.
- No.

1663
02:00:13,755 --> 02:00:15,382
Relax, Mama.

1664
02:00:15,674 --> 02:00:17,300
I just got back from the library

1665
02:00:17,384 --> 02:00:19,886
I reserved a private cubicle
for the semester.

1666
02:00:19,969 --> 02:00:22,430
Here's your class schedule
and our study hall hours.

1667
02:00:22,514 --> 02:00:25,892
Now, if y'all don't mind I'm gonna
go move into my new apartment.

1668
02:00:25,975 --> 02:00:28,436
- Thank you, Miss Sue.
- "Thank you, Miss Sue"

1669
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:30,271
Yeah, yeah, yeah....

1670
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:32,440
Let's see what you've got:
College's Writing, good,

1671
02:00:32,524 --> 02:00:34,401
psychology, math lab...

1672
02:00:34,484 --> 02:00:36,069
It's gonna be good. Just...

1673
02:00:36,152 --> 02:00:38,488
xxx know why.
A lot of good classes.

1674
02:00:38,738 --> 02:00:40,573
You'll have a lot of fun.

1675
02:00:40,657 --> 02:00:41,741
SJ!

1676
02:00:44,703 --> 02:00:47,372
Michael Oher, you listen to me, alright?

1677
02:00:47,997 --> 02:00:51,084
I want you to enjoy yourself, but if
you get a girl pregnant out of wedlock

1678
02:00:51,167 --> 02:00:55,338
I'll crawl in the car, drive up here
to Oxford and cut off your penis.

1679
02:00:55,797 --> 02:00:57,298
She means it.

1680
02:00:58,341 --> 02:01:00,010
- Yes ma'am.
- Alright

1681
02:01:03,346 --> 02:01:07,475
Now, 78's gonna be a parking lot.
So we should be going. Or everyone...

1682
02:01:07,809 --> 02:01:09,978
Say the goodbyes, alright?
Here.

1683
02:01:10,228 --> 02:01:10,770
Bye, baby.

1684
02:01:10,854 --> 02:01:13,231
- Thank you, Mama.
- You're welcome.

1685
02:01:22,157 --> 02:01:24,117
Why'd she always do that?

1686
02:01:24,576 --> 02:01:28,705
She's an onion. Michael. You have
to peel her back one layer at a time.

1687
02:01:31,583 --> 02:01:33,043
I'll be back.

1688
02:01:44,429 --> 02:01:45,722
What?

1689
02:01:52,270 --> 02:01:53,813
What, Michael?

1690
02:01:54,022 --> 02:01:55,690
I need a proper hug.

1691
02:02:19,255 --> 02:02:22,759
{y:i}I read a story the other day
about a boy from the projects.

1692
02:02:23,593 --> 02:02:26,471
{y:i}No daddy, in and out of foster care.

1693
02:02:27,597 --> 02:02:30,809
{y:i}He'd been killed in a
gang fight at Hurt Village.

1694
02:02:31,851 --> 02:02:35,897
{y:i}In the last paragraph they talked about
his superb athletic skills

1695
02:02:36,523 --> 02:02:38,233
{y:i}and how different his life
might have been

1696
02:02:38,316 --> 02:02:41,528
{y:i}if he hadn't fallen behind
and dropped out of school.

1697
02:02:41,736 --> 02:02:44,489
{y:i}He was twenty-one years old
the day he died.

1698
02:02:45,532 --> 02:02:47,200
{y:i}It was his birthday.

1699
02:02:53,164 --> 02:02:55,166
{y:i}That could have been anyone.

1700
02:02:55,458 --> 02:02:57,919
{y:i}It could have been my son, Michael.

1701
02:02:59,004 --> 02:03:00,505
{y:i}But it wasn't.

1702
02:03:03,717 --> 02:03:06,428
{y:i}And I suppose I have God
to thank for that.

1703
02:03:09,764 --> 02:03:12,058
{y:i}God and Lawrence Taylor.

1704
02:03:24,070 --> 02:03:25,530
{y:i}One Mississippi.

1705
02:04:02,776 --> 02:04:05,612
The New England Patriots have traded
the twenty third pick

1706
02:04:05,695 --> 02:04:07,489
to the Baltimore Ravens.

1707
02:04:08,490 --> 02:04:11,743
And with the twenty third
pick in 2009 NFL draft

1708
02:04:12,118 --> 02:04:13,912
The Baltimore Raven select...

1709
02:04:13,995 --> 02:04:17,040
Michael Oher.
Offensive tackle, Mississippi.
