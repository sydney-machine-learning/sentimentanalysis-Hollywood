1
00:00:45,636 --> 00:00:47,850
<i>Hey, you reached Doug.
Sorry, I missed your call.</i>

2
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,961
<i>Please leave a name and number
and I'll get back to you.</i>

3
00:00:57,301 --> 00:01:00,800
<i>Hi, you've reached Dr. Stuart Price
with Prime Dentistry.</i>

4
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:02,745
<i>Please leave a message after the...</i>

5
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:12,099
<i>Hey, this is Phil. Leave
me a message, or don't.</i>

6
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,068
<i>Do me a favor. Don't text me, it's gay.</i>

7
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:19,950
Anything?/ I tried them all.
It keeps going straight to voice mail.

8
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,420
There has to be an explanation./
Sweety, it's Vegas.

9
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,961
You'll lose track of time in those casinos.
There's no windows, or clocks.

10
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,934
He's probably on a heater.

11
00:01:28,935 --> 00:01:32,882
And you never walk away from the
table when you're on a heater.

12
00:01:32,882 --> 00:01:35,295
You do if you're getting married.

13
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:39,181
Tracy, it's Phil.

14
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:44,146
Phil, where the hell are
you guys? I'm freaking out.

15
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:46,051
Yea, listen...

16
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,778
We fucked up.

17
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,828
What are you talking about?

18
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:54,466
The bachelor party, the whole night.

19
00:01:56,018 --> 00:01:59,047
Things got out of control and, uh...

20
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:02,345
We lost Doug.

21
00:02:02,345 --> 00:02:05,384
What?/
We can't find Doug.

22
00:02:05,384 --> 00:02:09,345
What are you saying, Phil?
We're getting married in 5 hours.

23
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:11,784
Yeah.

24
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:13,938
That's not gonna happen.

25

Subtitle by:
D34N [subscene.com]

26
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:46,366
You have to move...
Thank you.

27
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:54,010
Whoa, watch it pervert!

28
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,026
It's okay Alan.
He's just doing your inseam.

29
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:58,038
It's getting very close to my shaft.

30
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:02,213
All done.
You can change now.

31
00:04:02,213 --> 00:04:05,345
Thanks, Floyd.
Thank you very much.

32
00:04:06,262 --> 00:04:08,416
Alright, buddy.
We should get a move on.

33
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:11,399
You know, Doug.
I was thinking...

34
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:15,977
If you wanna go to Vegas
without me, it's totally cool.

35
00:04:15,977 --> 00:04:17,806
What are you talking about?

36
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:21,460
Phil and Stu, they're your buddies
and it's your bachelor party.

37
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,680
Come on, Alan.
Those two love you.

38
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,544
I also don't want you to have to hold
back because your wife's brother is there.

39
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:30,613
It's not like that...

40
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:36,894
It's not like that.
I already told you, Alan.

41
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:40,085
We're just spending a night
in Vegas. It's no big deal.

42
00:04:40,973 --> 00:04:44,515
Besides, you're not just my wife's
brother, you're my brother now.

43
00:04:48,194 --> 00:04:51,626
I want you to know, Doug,
I'm a steel-trap.

44
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:56,312
Whatever happens tonight,
I will never, ever, speak a word of it.

45
00:04:56,312 --> 00:04:58,474
Okay, I got it. Thank you.
I don't think that...

46
00:04:58,474 --> 00:05:03,748
Seriously, I don't care what happens.
I don't care if we kill someone.

47
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:04,939
What?

48
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:08,257
You heard me.
It's Sin City.

49
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:10,931
Hold your soul.

50
00:05:11,848 --> 00:05:14,302
Okay, I got it.

51
00:05:17,222 --> 00:05:19,746
Thank you./
No. Thank you.

52
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:23,173
I love you so much.

53
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,534
No, Sid.

54
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,369
Really?/ Come on.
We're family now.

55
00:05:34,452 --> 00:05:36,463
Are you sure?
You love this car.

56
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:39,589
Doug, it's just a car. Just
make sure when you get there...

57
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,682
Put some armor all on the tires
so the sand doesn't seep in.

58
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:45,082
Absolutely.
That's easy.

59
00:05:45,898 --> 00:05:50,197
Don't let Alan drives. Because,
there's something wrong with him.

60
00:05:50,197 --> 00:05:53,740
Understood./ And Phil either.
I don't like him.

61
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:59,395
I will be the only one driving
this car. I promise./ Good.

62
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:02,889
Remember. What happens
in Vegas stays in Vegas.

63
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,517
Except for Herpes.
That shit'll come back with you.

64
00:06:09,909 --> 00:06:12,869
Hold on, I still need some
of your permission slips.

65
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:16,706
And $90 for the field trip to the
Griffith observatory next weekend.

66
00:06:16,706 --> 00:06:20,846
Pay now or forever regret missing out
in this experience of a lifetime, guys.

67
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:22,540
You're good. You got it./
Thank you Mr. Wenneck.

68
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,751
Thank you, Wilson.
Thanks Bob. Way to go.

69
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:51,584
Do you have to park so close?/
Yeah. What's wrong?

70
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:53,631
We shouldn't be here.

71
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:58,886
Why is that Alan?/ I'm not supposed
to be within 200 feet of a school.

72
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:02,277
What?/
Or Chuck E. Cheese.

73
00:07:05,911 --> 00:07:10,330
Hey, Mr. Wenneck./ It's the weekend,
Nick. I don't know you. You do not exist.

74
00:07:11,254 --> 00:07:15,376
Shit. Nice car./ Yeah./
I'm driving.

75
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:18,457
No chance, but...
Don't step...

76
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:21,984
Will you shut up and drive before one
of these nerds ask me another question.

77
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:25,680
Who's this?/
It's Alan. Tracy's brother.

78
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,781
I met you like, four times./
Oh yeah. How you doin', man?

79
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:35,362
Don't forget your Rogaine./
Rogaine, check.

80
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:37,589
And don't forget to use it.

81
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:41,510
I can totally tell when you forget.
Your hair just looks thinner.

82
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:45,166
Using of the Rogaine, check.

83
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:48,229
And make sure to call me right when
you get to the hotel, not like that...

84
00:07:48,229 --> 00:07:52,867
Conference in Phoenix. I had to wait
two hours for you to call me.

85
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:55,873
I was the keynote speaker.
I was late to the podium.

86
00:07:55,873 --> 00:07:59,803
Still.../ Yeah, you're
totally right. I'm sorry.

87
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:03,288
What is the matter?/
I don't know.

88
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:05,946
I just know you're gonna go to a
strip club when you're out there.

89
00:08:05,946 --> 00:08:09,266
Melissa, we're going to
Napa Valley.

90
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:11,534
I don't even think they have
strip club in wine country.

91
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:15,559
I'm sure if there's one,
Phil will sniff it out.

92
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:18,702
It's not gonna be like that.

93
00:08:19,309 --> 00:08:21,288
Besides, you know how I feel
about that sort of thing.

94
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:25,455
I know, it's just, boys and their
bachelor parties. It's gross.

95
00:08:25,455 --> 00:08:28,254
You're right. It is gross.

96
00:08:28,254 --> 00:08:32,062
Not to mention it's pathetic.
Those places are filthy.

97
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:35,362
And the worst part is...

98
00:08:35,362 --> 00:08:41,175
That little girl grinding, and dry
humping the fucking stage up there.

99
00:08:41,175 --> 00:08:43,457
That's somebody's daughter up there./
That's somebody's daughter up there.

100
00:08:43,457 --> 00:08:45,890
I was just gonna say that./
See?

101
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:47,933
I just wish your friends were
as mature as you.

102
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:51,362
They are mature, actually. You just
have to get to know them better.

103
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:54,175
<i>Paging Doctor Faggot.</i>

104
00:08:56,097 --> 00:08:58,488
<i>Doctor Faggot.</i>

105
00:09:01,263 --> 00:09:04,332
I should go./ That's a
good idea, Dr. Faggot.

106
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:09,187
Have a good weekend.
I'll miss you.

107
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:24,405
Road trip!

108
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,981
Hey, Vegas!
Vegas, baby.

109
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:32,285
Vegas.

110
00:09:39,057 --> 00:09:42,031
Come on, just 'till Barstow.
Everybody's passing us.

111
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:47,197
Absolutely not. I promised Sid,
I will be the only one driving this car.

112
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:49,693
Besides you're drinking./
What, are you a cop now?

113
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:51,729
You know I drive great
when I'm drunk.

114
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:55,941
That's true. Don't forget Phil was
always our designated drunk driver.

115
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:57,786
Do you wanna explain to them, Alan?

116
00:09:57,786 --> 00:10:01,088
Guys, my dad loves this car
more than he loves me, so yeah.

117
00:10:01,088 --> 00:10:04,180
I left my wife and my kid at home
so I can go with you guys to Vegas.

118
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,748
Do you know how difficult that was?

119
00:10:05,748 --> 00:10:06,929
It's really sweet, Phil.

120
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,243
I was being sarcastic.
I fucking hate my life.

121
00:10:10,244 --> 00:10:12,448
I may never go back. I
might just stay in Vegas.

122
00:10:12,448 --> 00:10:13,467
Here we go.

123
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:15,960
You know, Doug. You should enjoy
yourself, because come saturday...

124
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,685
You're gonna start dying
a little bit. Everyday.

125
00:10:20,741 --> 00:10:23,579
That's why I managed to
stay single this whole time.

126
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:29,501
Oh, really? That's why you're single?/
Yeah./ Cool. Good to know.

127
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,348
Am I alright over there, Alan?

128
00:10:31,348 --> 00:10:33,780
Yeah, you're good./
Alright.

129
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,785
Oh, Jesus Christ!/
Oh, my God.

130
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,496
That was awesome.

131
00:10:40,496 --> 00:10:43,467
That was not awesome!
What's wrong with you.

132
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:46,153
That was insane.
We almost just die.

133
00:10:46,153 --> 00:10:50,344
You should've seen your face.
It's classic.

134
00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:53,856
It's not funny.

135
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:13,742
You've got a sweet ride there./
Don't touch it.

136
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:20,565
Don't even look at it.
Go on. Get out. You heard me.

137
00:11:20,565 --> 00:11:22,437
Don't look at me either.

138
00:11:23,829 --> 00:11:27,141
<i>Yeah, you better walk on.</i>

139
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:30,741
He's actually kind of funny./
Yeah, he means well.

140
00:11:30,741 --> 00:11:32,400
<i>I'll hit an old man in public.</i>

141
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:35,444
Is he all there, like, mentally?

142
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:39,592
I think so, he's just not guy,
and he's kind of weird.

143
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:42,720
Should we be worried?/ No.

144
00:11:43,158 --> 00:11:47,761
Tracy did mention that we shouldn't
let him gamble or drink to much.

145
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:51,695
Jesus, he's like a gremlin.
Comes with instructions and shit

146
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:54,217
And one water.

147
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:56,699
I'll go with Melissa?/
Oh, yeah.

148
00:11:56,699 --> 00:12:01,845
I told her we're two hour outside
of wine country, and she bought it.

149
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:04,897
Don't you think it's strange that
you've been in relationship for 3 years..

150
00:12:04,897 --> 00:12:08,188
But you still have to lie about
going to Vegas./ Yeah, I do.

151
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:10,338
But, trust me it's not worth the fight.

152
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:16,309
So, you can't go to Vegas but she can
fuck a bellhop on a carnival cruise line.

153
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:22,227
Okay, first of all, he was a bartender.
And she was wasted.

154
00:12:22,227 --> 00:12:26,020
And if you must know,
he didn't even come inside her.

155
00:12:26,415 --> 00:12:29,858
And you believe that?/
Yeah I do believe that.

156
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:32,743
Because she's grossed out by semen.

157
00:12:32,743 --> 00:12:35,118
That'll be $32.50.

158
00:12:35,118 --> 00:12:37,449
It's $32.50, I'll pay for it.

159
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:44,993
It says here we should work in teams.
Who wants to be my spotter?

160
00:12:45,492 --> 00:12:48,804
I don't think you should be doing
too much gambling tonight, Alan.

161
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:51,045
Gambling? Who said
anything about gambling?

162
00:12:51,045 --> 00:12:52,748
It's not gambling when you know
you're gonna win.

163
00:12:52,748 --> 00:12:55,269
Counting card is a foolproof system.

164
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:59,583
It's also illegal./ It's not
illegal. It's frowned upon, like...

165
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,421
Masturbating on an airplane.

166
00:13:03,352 --> 00:13:05,400
I'm pretty sure that's illegal too.

167
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,327
Yeah, maybe after 9/11 where
everybody gets so sensitive.

168
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:12,687
Thanks a lot, Bin Laden.

169
00:13:14,324 --> 00:13:18,284
Either way, you gotta be super smart
to count cards, buddy./ Oh, really?

170
00:13:18,284 --> 00:13:20,887
It's not easy./ Maybe we
should tell that to rain man...

171
00:13:20,888 --> 00:13:24,385
Because he practically bankrupted
the casino and he was a 'ratard.'

172
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,386
What?

173
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:28,350
He was a 'ratard.'

174
00:13:28,957 --> 00:13:30,528
Retard.

175
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,144
Here we go.

176
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:16,078
Hi, welcome to Caesar's./ Hi.

177
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:17,714
Checking in?/ Yeah.

178
00:14:17,714 --> 00:14:22,096
We have a reservation under Dr. Price./
Okay, let me look that up for you.

179
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:27,521
Dr. Price? Stu, you're a dentist.
And don't try and get fancy.

180
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:32,062
It's not fancy if it's true./ He's
a dentist. Don't get too excited.

181
00:14:32,062 --> 00:14:35,375
And if someone has a heart attack,
you should still call 911.

182
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,394
We'll be sure to do that.

183
00:14:37,394 --> 00:14:38,459
Can I ask you a question?

184
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,582
Do you know if the hotel is
pager-friendly?/ What do you mean?

185
00:14:41,582 --> 00:14:45,182
I'm not getting a sig' on
my beeper./ I'm not sure.

186
00:14:45,182 --> 00:14:50,347
Is there a payphone bank?
Bunch of payphones? Business.

187
00:14:51,213 --> 00:14:55,059
There's a phone in your room./
That'll work.

188
00:14:55,565 --> 00:14:59,014
I have you in a two bedroom suite
on the 12th floor, is that okay?

189
00:14:59,014 --> 00:15:03,202
Sounds perfect./ Actually, I was
wondering if you have any villas available.

190
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,973
Phil, we're not even gonna be
in the room./ That's unnecessary.

191
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:08,060
It's no big deal. We can
share beds. One night.

192
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,336
If we share beds, I'm buckle with Phil.

193
00:15:11,336 --> 00:15:13,640
You good with that?/
No, I'm not good with that.

194
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,041
We're not sharing beds.
What, are we 12 years olds?

195
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,196
Lisa, I appologize.
How much is the villa?

196
00:15:19,196 --> 00:15:22,539
We have one villa available,
and it's $4200 for the night.

197
00:15:22,539 --> 00:15:24,630
Is it awesome?/
It's pretty awesome.

198
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,973
We'll take it.

199
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,046
Give her your credit card./
I can't give her my credit card.

200
00:15:29,046 --> 00:15:33,785
We'll split it./ Are you crazy?
No, this is on us.

201
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:36,678
You don't get it. Melissa
checks my statements.

202
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:38,004
We just need a credit
card on file.

203
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:40,298
We won't charge you
anything until you check out.

204
00:15:40,298 --> 00:15:43,850
So you can figure it out then./ Perfect.
That's Perfect. Thank you, Lisa.

205
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,547
And we'll deal with
it tomorrow. Come on.

206
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:48,704
Fine.

207
00:15:48,704 --> 00:15:50,989
Can I ask you another
question?/ Sure.

208
00:15:50,989 --> 00:15:54,550
You probably get this a lot. This
isn't the real Caesar's Palace, is it?

209
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:56,809
What do you mean?

210
00:15:59,979 --> 00:16:03,283
Did Caesar live here?/
No.

211
00:16:03,783 --> 00:16:05,262
I didn't think so.

212
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,762
Holy shit.

213
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:20,124
This is Vegas.

214
00:16:20,124 --> 00:16:24,646
Oh, my...
This place is enormous.

215
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:26,589
Now we're talking.

216
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:28,094
It's all one suite?

217
00:16:29,406 --> 00:16:32,951
Thank you, guys.
Or should I say thank you, Stu.

218
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,460
You're welcome.
It's only because I love you.

219
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:40,007
Okay, ladies, pick a room. Get dressed.
We should be ready in 30 minutes.

220
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:44,890
I just wish you could see this place,
because you, of all people...

221
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:49,518
Would love it. Yeah.
No, it's so quiet.

222
00:16:51,205 --> 00:16:52,553
There's no TVs, no phones.

223
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:56,598
They just have this cute little
antique radios in all the rooms.

224
00:17:00,239 --> 00:17:01,330
What else?

225
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:06,876
We met the proprietor.
What's his name?

226
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:11,785
Ceasar Palace.
Yeah, like the salad.

227
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:15,295
Okay, I gotta go. Because we're
gonna hit this wine tasting.

228
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:18,151
Okay, wait. I love you.

229
00:17:18,701 --> 00:17:20,323
Bye.

230
00:17:21,139 --> 00:17:23,005
I'm not even gonna say anything.
It's so embarassing.

231
00:17:23,778 --> 00:17:26,197
Where's Alan?/
He went downstairs.

232
00:17:26,197 --> 00:17:28,336
He said he had to grab a few things.

233
00:17:28,336 --> 00:17:32,822
Good. Because I have
something to show you.

234
00:17:36,679 --> 00:17:39,046
What the hell is that?/
What do you think it is?

235
00:17:39,046 --> 00:17:42,455
That's what I think it is.
I think it's a big fucking mistake.

236
00:17:42,455 --> 00:17:46,007
I'm gonna proposed to Melissa
at your wedding. After the ceremony.

237
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:49,971
Stuey, congratulations./
Thank you, Doug.

238
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:52,822
That's a beautiful ring./
Yeah, that's my grandmother's.

239
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,552
She made it all the way through the
holocaust with that thing. It's legit.

240
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:58,753
I don't get it. Have you not
listen to anything I've ever said?

241
00:17:58,753 --> 00:18:02,538
Phil, we've been dating for 3 years.
It's time. This is how it works.

242
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:05,750
A, that is bullshit. And
B, she is a complete bitch.

243
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,311
Hey, that's his fiance.

244
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:11,826
It's true. You know it's true.
She beats him.

245
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:17,559
That was twice and I was out of line.
She's strong-willed. And I respect that.

246
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:20,423
Wow. He's in denial.

247
00:18:20,423 --> 00:18:22,652
Not to mention she fucked the sailor.

248
00:18:22,652 --> 00:18:27,666
He wasn't a sailor. He was a bartender
on a cruise ship. You know that.

249
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:32,217
Guys, I'm standing right here, so
I can hear everything you're saying.

250
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:35,285
Hey, guys, you ready
to let the dogs out?/ What?

251
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:39,541
Let the dogs out. You know,
like, who let the dogs out.

252
00:18:40,548 --> 00:18:41,708
Who brought this guy along?

253
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:46,516
Yes, Alan. We're ready to let the
dogs out. Hey, congrats./ Thank you.

254
00:19:08,201 --> 00:19:12,176
You're not really wearing that, are you?/
Wearing what?/ The man purse.

255
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:15,591
You're actually gonna wear that or
you guys just fuckin' with me?

256
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:19,549
This is where I keep all my things.
I get a lot of compliments on this.

257
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:23,686
Plus it's not a man purse. It's called
a satchel. Indiana Jones wears one.

258
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:26,539
So does Joy Behar.

259
00:19:29,146 --> 00:19:31,796
We're going up, guys./
Yeah, that's perfect.

260
00:19:31,818 --> 00:19:33,236
Really?

261
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:34,444
We're going up?

262
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:42,739
I'm just saying it's
clearly marked, okay?

263
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,425
We're definitely not
supposed to be up here.

264
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:48,393
C'mon, Stu. We're paying for the villa.
We can do whatever the fuck we want.

265
00:19:48,565 --> 00:19:49,619
Just wedge the door up.

266
00:19:50,668 --> 00:19:51,542
Guy's come on up here.

267
00:19:57,076 --> 00:20:00,598
How the hell did you find this place?/
Don't worry about it.

268
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,343
You alright?/ Yeah.

269
00:20:05,343 --> 00:20:09,642
Look at the view up here./
Are you happy?/ This is great.

270
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:12,953
Wow. Are you kidding?

271
00:20:13,154 --> 00:20:14,617
Alan, how are we doing, buddy?/ Good.

272
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,667
What do you got over there, Alan?

273
00:20:16,975 --> 00:20:17,902
That's the Eiffel Tower.

274
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:25,124
A little Yagermeister. Good idea./
Good call./ On the roof.

275
00:20:26,598 --> 00:20:28,664
This is good. I'd like to make a toast.

276
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:33,676
To Doug and Tracy.
May tonight be...

277
00:20:34,822 --> 00:20:39,507
But a minor speed-bump and in otherwise
very long and healthy marriage.

278
00:20:39,828 --> 00:20:41,217
Cheers.

279
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:49,591
It's like college./ I wanna
talk about something.

280
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:53,758
I'd like to...
I'd like to say something.

281
00:20:55,563 --> 00:21:00,971
That I prepared tonight./
Alright, Alan.

282
00:21:04,557 --> 00:21:06,606
Hello.

283
00:21:07,611 --> 00:21:11,793
How bout that ride in. I guess
that's why they call it Sin City.

284
00:21:12,363 --> 00:21:13,829
Ha-ha-ha.

285
00:21:14,393 --> 00:21:18,468
You guys might not know this, but
I considered myself a bit of a loner.

286
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:22,731
I tend to think of myself
as a one-man wolf pack.

287
00:21:24,423 --> 00:21:27,326
But when my sister brought Doug home,
I knew he was one of my own.

288
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:31,807
And my wolf pack, it grew by one.

289
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,234
So there were two of
us in the wolf pack.

290
00:21:35,235 --> 00:21:40,035
I was alone first in the pack,
and then Doug joined in later.

291
00:21:41,086 --> 00:21:44,566
And six months ago, when
Doug introduced me to you guys...

292
00:21:44,814 --> 00:21:47,530
I thought, "Wait a second.
Could it be...?"

293
00:21:47,822 --> 00:21:52,562
And now I know for sure. I just
added two more guys to my wolf pack.

294
00:21:52,881 --> 00:21:54,763
Alright.

295
00:21:55,074 --> 00:22:00,486
Four of us wolves. Running around
the desert together. In Las Vegas.

296
00:22:01,234 --> 00:22:03,180
Looking for strippers and cocaine.

297
00:22:03,962 --> 00:22:07,105
So tonight, I make a toast.

298
00:22:07,488 --> 00:22:08,298
What do you got there?

299
00:22:09,687 --> 00:22:12,020
What the fuck?/
What are you doing?

300
00:22:15,758 --> 00:22:17,903
What is that?/
Blood brothers.

301
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:24,668
God damn it. Alan, no./
I'm not doing that. Make him stop.

302
00:22:25,353 --> 00:22:29,295
Alan, we're not gonna cut ourselves.
Give me the knife. Slowly. Thank you.

303
00:22:30,424 --> 00:22:33,087
Are you alright? Do you need a doctor?

304
00:22:33,397 --> 00:22:34,333
He's fine. He's good.

305
00:22:34,699 --> 00:22:36,157
Are you sure?/ I'm good./ Perfect.

306
00:22:36,444 --> 00:22:38,862
Alan, come here, buddy./
Get in here, crazy.

307
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:43,840
Alright. To a night the four
of us will never forget.

308
00:22:50,423 --> 00:22:52,490
Cheers.

309
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,319
What the fuck?

310
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,046
Control yourself, man. God damn.
Will you put on some pants?

311
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:36,946
Phil, do not go in the bathroom./
Alan, just calm down it's me.

312
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:39,144
Phil, there is a tiger in the bathroom.

313
00:25:40,088 --> 00:25:40,984
What's going on?

314
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:42,647
There's a jungle cat in the bathroom.

315
00:25:43,002 --> 00:25:45,338
Okay, I'll check it out.

316
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,721
Becareful. Don't.

317
00:25:51,147 --> 00:25:53,787
Holy fuck. He's not kidding.
There's a tiger in there.

318
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:55,629
No, there isn't./
Yeah.

319
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:58,182
That bitch is gigantic.

320
00:25:59,346 --> 00:26:02,804
You okay, buddy?/ No. I'm
in so much pain right now.

321
00:26:03,166 --> 00:26:06,259
God damn. Look at this place.

322
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:12,263
I know. Phil, they have my credit
card downstairs. I'm so screwed.

323
00:26:12,604 --> 00:26:14,974
How does a tiger get in the
bathroom? It almost killed me.

324
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,947
You mind putting on some pants? I find
it a little weird I have to ask twice.

325
00:26:19,176 --> 00:26:21,432
Pants, at times like this?
I dont have any.

326
00:26:23,575 --> 00:26:25,558
What the fuck happened last night.

327
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:28,194
Hey, Phil, am I missing a tooth?

328
00:26:34,975 --> 00:26:36,682
Oh, my god.

329
00:26:37,582 --> 00:26:39,485
My lateral incisor, it's gone.

330
00:26:40,018 --> 00:26:43,272
Okay, just calm down. We're
fine. Everything is fine.

331
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,612
Alan, go wake up Doug.

332
00:26:45,612 --> 00:26:48,077
Let's get some coffee and
get the fuck out of Nevada...

333
00:26:48,078 --> 00:26:49,310
Before house-keeping shows up.

334
00:26:49,491 --> 00:26:52,929
What am I gonna tell Melissa? I lost a
tooth. I have no idea how it happened.

335
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:57,016
You freaking me out, man. I got a
massive headache. Let's just calm down.

336
00:26:57,304 --> 00:26:59,949
How am I supposed to calm down?
Look around you.

337
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,153
Hey, guys, he's not in there.

338
00:27:02,352 --> 00:27:04,372
Did you check all the rooms?/
Yeah, I looked everywhere.

339
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,290
Plus his mattress is gone.

340
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:09,760
He probably went to the pool to get
something to eat. Let's call his cell.

341
00:27:11,876 --> 00:27:13,640
I look like a nerdy hillbilly.

342
00:27:28,826 --> 00:27:30,335
Alan./ Hey.

343
00:27:31,725 --> 00:27:34,202
It's Phil./
Oh, hey phil...

344
00:27:35,303 --> 00:27:36,896
This is Doug's phone.

345
00:27:37,037 --> 00:27:38,484
No shit./ Yeah.

346
00:27:42,971 --> 00:27:44,249
What the fuck is that?

347
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:53,203
Whose fuckin' baby is that?

348
00:27:53,603 --> 00:27:56,135
Alan, are you sure you didn't see
anyone else in the suite?

349
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:58,235
Yeah, I checked all the rooms.
No one's here.

350
00:27:58,524 --> 00:28:00,284
Check its collar or something.

351
00:28:03,343 --> 00:28:04,237
It's okay, baby.

352
00:28:04,613 --> 00:28:06,125
Stu, we don't have time for this.

353
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:08,172
Let's go hook up with Doug.
We'll deal with the baby later.

354
00:28:08,497 --> 00:28:10,780
Phil, we're not gonna
leave a baby in the room.

355
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:13,063
There's a fucking tiger in the bathroom.

356
00:28:13,378 --> 00:28:15,641
It's not our baby./ Yeah,
I gotta side with Stu on this one.

357
00:28:16,419 --> 00:28:19,856
Alright, fine. We'll take it with us.
Can you at least find some pants?

358
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:30,896
Why can't we remember a god
damned thing from last night?

359
00:28:32,162 --> 00:28:34,594
Because we obviously
had a great fucking time.

360
00:28:36,334 --> 00:28:38,658
Why don't you just stop
worrying for one minute.

361
00:28:39,745 --> 00:28:41,101
Proud of yourself.

362
00:28:46,551 --> 00:28:48,804
Oh, how cute. What's his name?

363
00:28:51,103 --> 00:28:52,105
Ben.

364
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:54,296
Carlos.

365
00:28:55,243 --> 00:28:56,236
Carlos?

366
00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:15,427
Hey, Phil, look.

367
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:21,537
He's jacking his little weenis.

368
00:29:21,955 --> 00:29:23,543
Pull yourself together, man.

369
00:29:23,898 --> 00:29:25,183
Not at the table, Carlos.

370
00:29:30,386 --> 00:29:31,435
I looked everywhere.

371
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,585
Gym, casino, front desk nobody
seen Doug. He's not here.

372
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:36,427
He's fine. He's a grown man.

373
00:29:36,836 --> 00:29:39,582
Seriously, Stu. You gotta calm
down. Here, have some juice.

374
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,401
Okay, let's just track this thing.

375
00:29:50,675 --> 00:29:52,540
What's the last thing we
remember doing last night?

376
00:29:52,865 --> 00:29:56,808
The first thing was we're on the roof
and we're having shots of Yager.

377
00:29:59,366 --> 00:30:01,834
And then we had dinner at
The Palm, right?/ That's right.

378
00:30:02,146 --> 00:30:06,307
Then we play crabs at the Hard
Rock, and I think Doug was there.

379
00:30:06,562 --> 00:30:08,841
That sounds right.
No, he definitely was.

380
00:30:09,302 --> 00:30:11,602
You know what, guys? I don't
even remember going to dinner.

381
00:30:12,175 --> 00:30:14,670
I know. What the fuck? I don't think
I've ever been this hungover.

382
00:30:14,971 --> 00:30:17,537
After the Hard Rock I blacked
out. It was like emptiness.

383
00:30:19,744 --> 00:30:21,744
We have him until 10
p.m so that gives us...

384
00:30:21,745 --> 00:30:23,727
A twelve hour window
where we could've lost him.

385
00:30:24,507 --> 00:30:25,208
What is this?

386
00:30:25,809 --> 00:30:28,234
Oh, my god. That is my tooth.

387
00:30:28,531 --> 00:30:29,839
Why do you have that?

388
00:30:30,605 --> 00:30:31,602
What else is in your pocket?

389
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:34,377
No, it's a good thing.
Check your pockets.

390
00:30:34,955 --> 00:30:36,503
Do you have anything?

391
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,281
I have an ATM receipt from The Bellagio.

392
00:30:40,242 --> 00:30:45,991
11:05 for $800.
I am so fucked.

393
00:30:46,783 --> 00:30:50,972
I have a valet ticket from Caesar's.
Looks like we got in at 5:15 am.

394
00:30:51,515 --> 00:30:53,093
Oh, shit. We drove last night?

395
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,274
Driving drunk. Classic.

396
00:30:59,853 --> 00:31:01,033
What's on your arm?

397
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:06,273
What the fuck?/ Jesus. Phil, you
were in the hospital last night.

398
00:31:06,548 --> 00:31:07,876
I guess so, yeah./ You okay?

399
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,818
Yeah, Alan. I'm fine.

400
00:31:10,175 --> 00:31:14,457
What the hell is going on?/ Stu, this
is a good thing. We have a lead now.

401
00:31:14,712 --> 00:31:16,289
Hey, Stu. Watch this.

402
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,227
Do you ever see a baby do that?

403
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,304
Alan, it's not cool.

404
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:30,994
Are you sure you're qualified to be
taking care of that baby?

405
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,971
What are you talkin' about?
I've found a baby before.

406
00:31:33,242 --> 00:31:34,833
You've found a baby before?/
Yeah.

407
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:37,379
Where?/ Coffee Bean.

408
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:43,894
Hey, Phil, I don't think Doug
would want us to take the Mercedes.

409
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,731
Relax we'll be careful.

410
00:31:45,182 --> 00:31:48,022
My dad is crazy about that car
and he left Doug in charge.

411
00:31:48,163 --> 00:31:52,936
Alan, we got bigger problems here. Doug
could be in hospital. He could be hurt.

412
00:31:53,623 --> 00:31:55,192
Let's worry about the car later.

413
00:31:55,574 --> 00:31:57,286
Guys, check it out.

414
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,875
Is that the mattress from Doug's room?

415
00:32:05,803 --> 00:32:07,438
What the fuck?

416
00:32:08,833 --> 00:32:10,885
Hey, what's going on?

417
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:14,517
Some assholes threw his bed
off the window last night.

418
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:15,608
No shit.

419
00:32:17,216 --> 00:32:19,095
Some guys just can't handle Vegas.

420
00:32:25,305 --> 00:32:26,624
It's gonna be okay, Stu.

421
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,298
How the hell did a mattress...

422
00:32:33,895 --> 00:32:34,980
Here's your car, officers.

423
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:36,540
Oh, god.

424
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:41,472
Alright, everybody act cool. Don't
say a word. Let's just get in and go.

425
00:32:45,752 --> 00:32:47,730
Stu, you got a 5?/
No.

426
00:32:48,988 --> 00:32:50,483
I'll hit you on the way back.

427
00:32:50,483 --> 00:32:51,331
Thank you, sir.

428
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,556
Oh, my god.

429
00:32:55,667 --> 00:32:57,513
You just nailed the baby.

430
00:32:58,377 --> 00:32:59,259
My glasses okay?

431
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,709
Your glasses are fine, dick.

432
00:33:08,383 --> 00:33:09,627
This is so illegal.

433
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:12,968
Can't you see the fun part of anything?

434
00:33:14,086 --> 00:33:16,291
Yeah we're stuck in traffic
in a stolen police car...

435
00:33:16,569 --> 00:33:18,579
With what is sure to be a
missing child in the back seat.

436
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,104
Which part of this is fun?

437
00:33:20,953 --> 00:33:22,765
I think the cop car part is pretty cool.

438
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:26,121
Thank you, Alan. It is cool.
Doug would love it.

439
00:33:28,044 --> 00:33:29,258
Come on.

440
00:33:32,484 --> 00:33:33,233
Check this out.

441
00:33:33,673 --> 00:33:37,221
Oh, no. Don't, Phil. Don't
do this./ Take it easy.

442
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:39,820
Just don't try to call for more
attention to us./ Attention./ Sorry.

443
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,898
<i>Attention, please.
Move out of the way.</i>

444
00:33:42,245 --> 00:33:45,006
<i>I repeat. Please disperse.</i>

445
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:50,108
Phil, stop the car.
I wanna get out. Pull over.

446
00:33:50,468 --> 00:33:52,158
<i>Ma'm, in the leopard dress...</i>

447
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:53,692
<i>You have an amazing rack.</i>

448
00:33:55,774 --> 00:33:58,116
Get off the sidewalk.

449
00:33:58,421 --> 00:34:00,118
I should've been a fuckin' cop.

450
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,072
Look, I already told you.

451
00:34:08,073 --> 00:34:10,430
You came in here with a mild
concussion, some bruised ribs.

452
00:34:10,431 --> 00:34:11,216
No big deal.

453
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:13,406
Although none of you could
articulate how it happened.

454
00:34:13,793 --> 00:34:15,820
Do you remember how
many of us were here?

455
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:20,123
I don't know. I think
it was just you guys.

456
00:34:20,432 --> 00:34:21,316
Definitely no baby.

457
00:34:21,716 --> 00:34:22,706
And one other guy.

458
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,241
That's our guy.
Was he okay?

459
00:34:25,634 --> 00:34:28,524
Yeah, he was fine. Just whacked
out of his mind. You all were.

460
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,003
Alright. Come forward.

461
00:34:31,858 --> 00:34:32,933
And turn.

462
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:36,130
Alright, here we go.

463
00:34:36,865 --> 00:34:37,996
And cough.

464
00:34:39,016 --> 00:34:41,384
Cough.

465
00:34:42,582 --> 00:34:43,193
Give me one more.

466
00:34:44,112 --> 00:34:45,929
Alright. Attaboy.

467
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,401
Felix, you can put your robe on.
The nurse will be here in a minute.

468
00:34:51,783 --> 00:34:53,456
I'll see you after the weekend.

469
00:34:54,038 --> 00:34:55,593
Thank you, doctor.

470
00:34:59,341 --> 00:35:02,359
Guys, I really gotta go. I'm sorry.
I have a surgery up on the 4th floor.

471
00:35:03,264 --> 00:35:06,114
I know. We just need a couple
more minutes of your time.

472
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,685
Yeah. Tuck it right in there.
I don't wanna resterilized.

473
00:35:13,637 --> 00:35:14,944
Walk with me.

474
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:20,502
Okay, here we go.
Patient name Phil Wenneck.

475
00:35:20,564 --> 00:35:22,789
2:45 a.m arrival.

476
00:35:23,095 --> 00:35:26,350
Minor concussion like I said.
Some bruising. Pretty standard.

477
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:28,380
Do you mind if I take a look.
I'm actually a doctor.

478
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:31,818
You said that several times last night.
But, really, you're just a dentist.

479
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,657
Okay, this is interesting.

480
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:37,994
Your blood work came in this morning.

481
00:35:41,076 --> 00:35:43,081
They found a large amount
of Roophyllin in your system.

482
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:48,236
Roophyllin? Roofies? Commonly
known as the "Date Rape Drug?"

483
00:35:49,366 --> 00:35:51,156
Are you saying I was raped last night?

484
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,735
Actually...

485
00:35:57,414 --> 00:36:00,437
I don't think so. But,
someone did slip you the drug.

486
00:36:00,828 --> 00:36:02,395
I'm not surprised you
don't remember anything.

487
00:36:03,635 --> 00:36:06,961
Doc, none of us can remember
anything from last night. Remember?

488
00:36:08,551 --> 00:36:09,974
How could someone drugged all of us?

489
00:36:10,817 --> 00:36:13,256
I wouldn't be worried about it.
By now the stuff is out of your system.

490
00:36:13,556 --> 00:36:14,792
You're gonna be fine. I have to go.

491
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,518
Wait, please doctor.

492
00:36:16,518 --> 00:36:19,734
Is there anything else like
something we've been talking about?

493
00:36:19,898 --> 00:36:21,055
Or some place we were going?

494
00:36:22,187 --> 00:36:23,946
Actually there was something.

495
00:36:24,272 --> 00:36:26,524
You guys kept talking about
some wedding last night.

496
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:29,270
Yeah. No shit. Our buddy Doug
is getting married tomorrow.

497
00:36:29,665 --> 00:36:31,832
I want the hundred back./
No. Easy.

498
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,252
You kept talking about some
wedding that you just came from.

499
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:36,315
At the Best Little Chapel.

500
00:36:36,315 --> 00:36:38,228
You guys kept saying how
sick the wedding was...

501
00:36:38,228 --> 00:36:39,276
And getting all crazy about it.

502
00:36:40,313 --> 00:36:42,127
I hope this helps, fellas.
I really have to leave.

503
00:36:42,477 --> 00:36:44,833
You know Best Little Chapel?
Do you know where that is?

504
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:48,346
I do. It's on the corner of
'get a map' and 'fuck off'.

505
00:36:50,805 --> 00:36:52,087
I'm a doctor, not a tour guide.

506
00:36:52,332 --> 00:36:55,440
Figure it out yourself, okay?
You're big boys.

507
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:08,935
What about the baby?

508
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,407
Just leave him in the car.
We're only gonna be 5 minutes.

509
00:37:11,408 --> 00:37:14,988
We're not leaving a baby in the car./
He'll be fine. I cracked the window.

510
00:37:20,419 --> 00:37:22,905
What if they don't remember us./
Well, let's just find out.

511
00:37:25,306 --> 00:37:26,623
Excuse me sir.

512
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:31,628
Look at these guys. What
happened? You missed me?

513
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:35,007
You miss Eddie. You want more
from me? Come here, my friend.

514
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:37,332
Look at this guy.
You fuckin' crazy.

515
00:37:37,747 --> 00:37:39,239
What's going on, man?

516
00:37:39,813 --> 00:37:42,297
Listen, I wanna tell you something.
I know some sick people in my life.

517
00:37:42,504 --> 00:37:47,546
This guy is the craziest, wildest
bastard I ever met in my life.

518
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,654
This guy is out of his mind. What's
going on, you fucking crazy motherfucker?

519
00:37:52,002 --> 00:37:53,599
I thought he was gonna eat my dick.

520
00:37:54,035 --> 00:37:57,120
What happened? No love for
Eddie? You don't hug me?

521
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,414
No, it's not that, Eddie.
It's just that...

522
00:38:00,963 --> 00:38:03,861
We're having a hard time remembering
what happened here last night.

523
00:38:04,247 --> 00:38:06,769
Was there a wedding here?
Do you do a weddings here?

524
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,712
You're cracking my balls, man.

525
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:13,315
Eddie, obviously we were here last night.
We're looking for a friend, Doug.

526
00:38:13,531 --> 00:38:15,637
Do you remember him?/ Yeah.
The small guy. Like a monkey.

527
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:18,006
You saw him?/
Of course.

528
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:21,668
Is there anything you can tell us about
what may have happened last night?

529
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:24,813
You don't remember nothing?

530
00:38:29,447 --> 00:38:31,027
Congratulations, Stu.
You got married.

531
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:33,566
This can't be happening.

532
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,610
Oh, god./
Look at that.

533
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:43,443
I tell you one thing. You looked
seriously happy here, man.

534
00:38:44,876 --> 00:38:46,707
That's it. My life is over.

535
00:38:47,168 --> 00:38:50,343
Stu, its okay. Shit happens. Melissa's
not gonna know anything about this.

536
00:38:50,618 --> 00:38:53,129
This never happened.
I'll take care of it.

537
00:38:54,887 --> 00:38:55,583
Hey, what's all that?

538
00:38:55,891 --> 00:38:57,507
The high-roller package.
It's what you guys order.

539
00:38:57,843 --> 00:38:59,957
I have coffee mugs.

540
00:39:00,343 --> 00:39:01,858
You have baseball caps, huh?

541
00:39:02,315 --> 00:39:05,670
And fancy calendars all with
pictures of Stu and Jade.

542
00:39:05,974 --> 00:39:07,930
Her name's Jade?/
Yeah, she's beautiful, man.

543
00:39:08,226 --> 00:39:12,095
Clean. Very tight. Tits, like that.
But that's because she had a baby.

544
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:14,639
That explains the baby./
Oh, Carlos./ Great.

545
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,753
Alright. Eddie, here's the deal.
We made a major mistake last night.

546
00:39:18,009 --> 00:39:19,670
We need to get this
marriage annuled immediately.

547
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:21,498
You do annulments?/
Of course I do annulments.

548
00:39:21,814 --> 00:39:23,204
It breaks my heart and
gonna make me very sad.

549
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:25,356
But it's not a problem. I'm gonna
make a very good price for you.

550
00:39:25,762 --> 00:39:29,278
I can't do it with just him though.
I need the chick. I need both parties.

551
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:30,695
Not a problem. That's great.

552
00:39:31,124 --> 00:39:31,769
Isn't that great, Stu?

553
00:39:32,322 --> 00:39:34,374
C'mon, buddy. She probably
know where Doug is.

554
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:35,860
Awesome./ Alright.

555
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,698
We need her address. She must have
filled out some paperworks, right?

556
00:39:40,699 --> 00:39:41,488
Of course.

557
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:44,745
Hey, excuse me.
What's the matter with you?

558
00:39:45,135 --> 00:39:47,696
Go get the paperwork now.
I've spent my life waiting for you.

559
00:39:48,092 --> 00:39:50,825
Come on. And get the bakhala, please.

560
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:57,374
Hey, Phil, what about my dad's car?

561
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:59,324
I'm sure Doug has it.
We'll get it back.

562
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:02,189
Then I vote we torch the cop
car and all the shit with it.

563
00:40:04,496 --> 00:40:06,352
Torch it? Who are you?

564
00:40:06,875 --> 00:40:10,325
I don't know, Phil. Apparently I'm a
guy who married a complete strangers.

565
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:14,892
This whole situation
is completely fucked.

566
00:40:16,154 --> 00:40:22,788
These mugs. This hat. This car. It's all
evidence of a night that never happened.

567
00:40:23,165 --> 00:40:25,366
That is why we're torching all of it.

568
00:40:26,068 --> 00:40:27,876
I'm a school teacher.
I got a family.

569
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:30,324
I'm on for secrecy. But I'm not
gonna torch a fuckin' cop car.

570
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:31,926
Fine. I'll do it.

571
00:40:32,178 --> 00:40:33,978
Can I help?/
Yeah. Thanks.

572
00:40:35,139 --> 00:40:38,446
Shit. Is it Doug?/ I don't
have any./ It's Doug.

573
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,748
It's Melissa.

574
00:40:40,216 --> 00:40:42,612
Don't answer it./ I have to.
She's called twice already.

575
00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:45,635
Hey, sweetheart.
How are you?

576
00:40:46,199 --> 00:40:48,995
There you are. It's the
third time I'm trying you.

577
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:52,001
I know. The receptions up here is crazy.

578
00:40:52,353 --> 00:40:56,433
I think it's all the sequoia trees
block the signal./ I hate that.

579
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:58,239
So, how was it last night?

580
00:40:58,564 --> 00:41:01,381
It was really fun actually. It's
kinda quiet. It was a good time.

581
00:41:01,788 --> 00:41:06,737
That sounds nice./ We're on
in all kind of vino factoids.

582
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,851
So cool if I could
breast-feed, you know.

583
00:41:14,688 --> 00:41:17,847
We're about to go for a tractor ride.
So I should probably get going.

584
00:41:18,221 --> 00:41:19,506
A tractor ride?/ So pretty.

585
00:41:21,827 --> 00:41:22,668
Let's go. Out of the car.

586
00:41:23,075 --> 00:41:25,141
What was that?/ They just
started up the tractor.

587
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,091
I think it backfired.

588
00:41:26,365 --> 00:41:27,175
Where the hell is he?

589
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:31,216
Hey, easy. I think we're
looking for the same guy.

590
00:41:32,897 --> 00:41:34,127
What the hell, man?

591
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:37,103
Where the fuck are you?
Is that a baby?

592
00:41:37,377 --> 00:41:40,536
Why it has to be a baby?
We're in winery. It's a goat.

593
00:41:40,536 --> 00:41:41,156
Where is he?

594
00:41:41,453 --> 00:41:43,604
I don't know what you're talking about.

595
00:41:44,143 --> 00:41:46,504
Sir, could you please start the
tractor so we can get out of here?

596
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:48,761
I'm trying to but we're fuckin' blocked.

597
00:41:49,061 --> 00:41:51,062
Oh, my god. What the
hell is happening, Stu?

598
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:53,455
Hey, there's a baby on board!

599
00:41:53,555 --> 00:41:54,882
Someone just said baby.

600
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:56,832
Get out of the car./
It's a baby goat.

601
00:41:57,256 --> 00:41:59,448
Chinese guy, why do you making
trouble for my business, man.

602
00:41:59,449 --> 00:42:00,544
Go away from here now.

603
00:42:00,793 --> 00:42:03,702
Get out of the fuckin' car./ Phil, he's
got a gun./ No shit he's gotta gun.

604
00:42:04,043 --> 00:42:04,820
I gotta call you back.

605
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,257
They shot Eddie./
Fuck this shit.

606
00:42:18,047 --> 00:42:19,607
Go, go, go.

607
00:42:25,382 --> 00:42:28,181
That was some serious shit.
Who were those guys?

608
00:42:28,517 --> 00:42:30,648
We're gonna be okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

609
00:42:30,869 --> 00:42:32,601
What the fuck is going on?

610
00:42:33,756 --> 00:42:34,998
I have no idea.

611
00:42:41,804 --> 00:42:43,446
Why don't you just let
that one go to voice mail?

612
00:42:46,837 --> 00:42:48,659
That's a fake laugh, by the way.

613
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:55,964
It's got Ted Danson and Magnum
P.I. and that jewish actor.

614
00:42:56,841 --> 00:43:00,111
Shut up, Alan. What room
was it again?/ It's 825.

615
00:43:01,421 --> 00:43:02,331
<i>I already checked with her.</i>

616
00:43:04,188 --> 00:43:05,163
I've found him. I call you back.

617
00:43:05,756 --> 00:43:07,691
Thank god. He's with his father.

618
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:09,376
I was freakin' out.

619
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:11,228
I miss you, sweety.

620
00:43:12,383 --> 00:43:13,513
Honey, I miss you.

621
00:43:20,388 --> 00:43:22,096
What the hell happened to you guys?

622
00:43:22,294 --> 00:43:24,141
Actually, we were
hoping you could tell us.

623
00:43:24,449 --> 00:43:25,911
What do you mean?
I got up this morning.

624
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:29,327
I went to get you guys some coffe,
and I came back and you were gone.

625
00:43:31,287 --> 00:43:32,849
Why are you being so quiet?

626
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,115
I'm no being quiet.

627
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:36,968
He's so cute.

628
00:43:37,216 --> 00:43:39,678
I gotta feed Tyler.
Come inside, you guys.

629
00:43:42,444 --> 00:43:44,603
Did you hear that?
The baby's name is Tyler.

630
00:43:45,611 --> 00:43:47,435
I thought he looked more
like a Carlos too, buddy.

631
00:43:51,851 --> 00:43:54,428
Okay, what's up. You
guys are acting weird.

632
00:43:55,335 --> 00:43:57,892
Look, it's Jade, right?/
Very funny, Phil.

633
00:43:58,806 --> 00:43:59,913
Right, Jade. Uh.

634
00:44:00,607 --> 00:44:01,733
Do you remember our friend, Doug?

635
00:44:02,207 --> 00:44:04,153
Are you kidding? He was
the best man in our wedding.

636
00:44:04,347 --> 00:44:07,169
Exactly. We can't find him
and we got a little worried.

637
00:44:07,327 --> 00:44:10,571
Oh, my god.
That is so Doug.

638
00:44:15,135 --> 00:44:17,134
I'm gonna go clean him up.
It's alright. Daddy didn't mean it.

639
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,033
Oh, my god.

640
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,340
What the fuck, man?
You gotta hold it together.

641
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,072
Holy shit./ She is super hot.
You should be proud of yourself.

642
00:44:25,266 --> 00:44:27,541
She is wearing my grandmother's ring.

643
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:29,505
The ring I'm gonna give to Melissa.

644
00:44:29,506 --> 00:44:31,280
Remember my grandmother's
holocaust ring?

645
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:33,015
She's wearing it.

646
00:44:34,018 --> 00:44:35,715
I didn't know they give
out rings at the holocaust.

647
00:44:37,581 --> 00:44:39,589
He's okay./ Good.

648
00:44:40,312 --> 00:44:41,744
He was just hungry.
That's fine.

649
00:44:42,353 --> 00:44:45,901
About last night. Do you remember
the last time you saw Doug?

650
00:44:46,741 --> 00:44:48,092
I haven't seen him since the wedding.

651
00:44:48,473 --> 00:44:49,566
The wedding. Okay.

652
00:44:52,665 --> 00:44:53,671
What time was that at?

653
00:44:58,503 --> 00:45:01,724
I guess it was around 1. Because I had
to go back to work and finish my shift.

654
00:45:02,007 --> 00:45:04,948
And then when I got out. I headed
over to the hotel with Tyler.

655
00:45:05,204 --> 00:45:06,685
And was Doug there then?

656
00:45:06,822 --> 00:45:08,644
I didn't see Doug. Because
you guys were passed out.

657
00:45:08,644 --> 00:45:12,414
The room was a wreck. So
I was just curled up next to Stu.

658
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:17,784
I got a question.

659
00:45:18,089 --> 00:45:20,853
You said when your shift ended.
Is that mean you're a nurse?

660
00:45:21,536 --> 00:45:23,540
Or a blackjack dealer?

661
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:26,048
You know this. I'm a stripper.

662
00:45:26,861 --> 00:45:30,623
Technically I'm an escort, but stripping
is a great way to meet the clients.

663
00:45:31,504 --> 00:45:32,841
Smart.

664
00:45:32,841 --> 00:45:33,426
Savvy.

665
00:45:33,716 --> 00:45:36,178
But that's all in the past
now that I'm marrying a doctor.

666
00:45:37,409 --> 00:45:38,521
I'm just a dentist.

667
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:42,655
Police. Freeze!

668
00:45:42,655 --> 00:45:44,508
Shut that baby up.

669
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,367
Okay.

670
00:45:53,621 --> 00:45:55,876
So after we take the mugshot,
we bring'em on down here...

671
00:45:55,876 --> 00:45:59,288
Where they wait to be interviewed
by the arresting officers.

672
00:45:59,595 --> 00:46:02,981
Trust me, kids. You do not want
to be sitting on these benches.

673
00:46:03,231 --> 00:46:05,533
We call this place Loserville.

674
00:46:07,169 --> 00:46:08,418
Follow me.

675
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,392
Hello.

676
00:46:16,826 --> 00:46:19,207
Hey Tracy, it's Phil.

677
00:46:19,498 --> 00:46:21,166
Hey, Phil. Where are you guys?

678
00:46:21,502 --> 00:46:24,197
We are at the spa, at the hotel.

679
00:46:24,486 --> 00:46:27,136
Cool. I just get some sun.
Is Doug around?

680
00:46:27,424 --> 00:46:29,197
Of course he's around.
Why wouldn't he be around?

681
00:46:29,567 --> 00:46:31,528
I'm just wondering
why you're calling me.

682
00:46:33,465 --> 00:46:37,751
We made a deal, no talking
to girlfriends or wife.

683
00:46:38,336 --> 00:46:39,965
We just call each other's.

684
00:46:40,845 --> 00:46:42,515
Okay. What's up?

685
00:46:42,938 --> 00:46:46,324
You are not gonna believe this. We
got comp an extra night at the hotel.

686
00:46:46,594 --> 00:46:47,226
You did?

687
00:46:47,531 --> 00:46:50,657
Yeah. The suite is ridiculous.
It's out of control.

688
00:46:50,728 --> 00:46:54,236
It was room service and a butler.

689
00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:56,362
We had figured to spent
the night here and then...

690
00:46:56,664 --> 00:46:58,857
We're just gonna come back
totally relax in the morning.

691
00:46:59,407 --> 00:47:02,268
You wanna stay an extra night?
But the wedding is tomorrow.

692
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,691
That's why we're gonna
get up really early and...

693
00:47:04,915 --> 00:47:06,083
We'll be back with plenty of times.

694
00:47:06,510 --> 00:47:08,429
Okay. Are you sure that's a good idea?

695
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,474
Wenneck, Price, Garner. Room 3.

696
00:47:11,852 --> 00:47:13,535
Okay, Trace, I gotta go.
Talk to you later.

697
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:20,142
Come on. Chop chop./
Just spin around.

698
00:47:22,517 --> 00:47:25,051
Wait a second./
I'll go over.

699
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:29,948
There we go.

700
00:47:37,562 --> 00:47:41,776
Gentlemen. We got some
good news and some bad news.

701
00:47:42,096 --> 00:47:44,143
The good news is, we
found your Mercedes.

702
00:47:45,257 --> 00:47:46,696
That's great news.

703
00:47:47,417 --> 00:47:48,629
It's over impound right now.

704
00:47:49,556 --> 00:47:53,765
We picked it up at 5 a.m this morning.
Parked in the middle of Las Vegas Blvd.

705
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:58,103
It's weird./
Yeah. It is weird.

706
00:47:58,845 --> 00:48:00,573
There's also a note.

707
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:05,215
It says, "couldn't find the meter,
but here's 4 bucks."

708
00:48:07,375 --> 00:48:09,100
The bad news is...

709
00:48:09,464 --> 00:48:11,875
We can't get you in front of
the judge until Monday morning.

710
00:48:14,475 --> 00:48:16,803
Officer that's just impossible.

711
00:48:16,985 --> 00:48:18,900
We need to be in L.A
tomorrow for a wedding.

712
00:48:19,213 --> 00:48:20,778
You stole a police car.

713
00:48:21,051 --> 00:48:24,175
We didn't steal anything.
We found it.

714
00:48:24,536 --> 00:48:27,681
If anything, we deserve a reward
or something. Like a trophy?

715
00:48:28,218 --> 00:48:31,318
I see assholes like you
everyday./ Every fuckin' day.

716
00:48:31,652 --> 00:48:34,047
Let's go to Vegas. We
all get drunk and laid.

717
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:38,545
Let's steal a cop car, 'cause
it'll be really fuckin' funny.

718
00:48:38,936 --> 00:48:40,837
Think you can get away
with it? Not up in here!

719
00:48:41,435 --> 00:48:42,538
Not up in here!

720
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,411
Sir...

721
00:48:48,747 --> 00:48:53,819
If I may. I'm assuming that squad
car belongs to one of you./ Yeah.

722
00:48:55,638 --> 00:48:56,896
I'm not a cop.

723
00:48:57,265 --> 00:48:58,414
I'm no hero.

724
00:48:58,733 --> 00:49:00,215
I'm a school teacher.

725
00:49:01,367 --> 00:49:04,249
But if one of my kids went
missing on a field trip...

726
00:49:05,557 --> 00:49:07,274
That looked really bad on me.

727
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:09,905
What are you getting at?

728
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,161
Yeah, Phil. What are you getting at?

729
00:49:11,592 --> 00:49:13,475
No one wants to look bad.

730
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:15,334
We gotta get to a wedding.

731
00:49:15,631 --> 00:49:18,861
And you guys don't need people
talking about some obnoxious tourist...

732
00:49:19,144 --> 00:49:21,222
Borrowed your squad car last night.

733
00:49:21,907 --> 00:49:26,337
The point is, I think we can work
out a deal. Discretely of course, ma'm.

734
00:49:27,767 --> 00:49:28,714
What do you say?

735
00:49:38,741 --> 00:49:39,809
Let me ask you a question.

736
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:45,012
Do any of you gentlemen have any
heart conditon, or anything like that?

737
00:49:47,381 --> 00:49:48,120
No.

738
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,616
Okay, kids. You're in
for a real treat today.

739
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:53,898
These gentlemen have kindly
volunteered to demonstrate...

740
00:49:54,204 --> 00:49:56,757
How a stun gun is used
to subdue a suspect.

741
00:49:58,459 --> 00:49:59,046
What?

742
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:01,315
Now, there's two ways to use a stun gun.

743
00:50:01,722 --> 00:50:02,916
Up close and personal.

744
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:08,831
Or you can shoot it from a distance.

745
00:50:09,846 --> 00:50:12,011
Do I have any volunteers who wanna
come up here to do some shooting?

746
00:50:12,461 --> 00:50:14,505
How bout you, young lady.
Come on up here.

747
00:50:16,105 --> 00:50:17,220
Let's go, handsome.
Come on.

748
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:20,051
Not you, fat Jesus.
Slide it on back.

749
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:21,391
You, pretty boy.

750
00:50:22,687 --> 00:50:26,552
It's real simple. All you gotta
do is point, aim, and shoot.

751
00:50:29,841 --> 00:50:31,177
You don't really wanna do this.

752
00:50:31,531 --> 00:50:33,337
You can do this. Just focus.

753
00:50:33,736 --> 00:50:36,616
Don't listen to this maniac.
Let's think this thing through.

754
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:37,321
Finish him!

755
00:50:42,722 --> 00:50:44,480
Right in the nuts.
That was beautiful.

756
00:50:46,075 --> 00:50:48,983
Well done. Give her a hand,
everybody. Alright./ Good job.

757
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:53,923
Good job. Well done.
That was great.

758
00:50:54,653 --> 00:50:56,427
Hey, we got one more charge left.

759
00:50:56,629 --> 00:50:58,118
Anybody wanna do
some shooting up here?

760
00:51:00,502 --> 00:51:02,185
How about you, big man.
Come on up here.

761
00:51:19,515 --> 00:51:22,327
Okay. Same instructions.
Just point, aim, and shoot.

762
00:51:26,922 --> 00:51:30,558
There you go. That's the stuff.
I like the intensity.

763
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:32,355
Eye the tiger. Good.

764
00:51:33,603 --> 00:51:37,877
You're holding 50.000 volts, little man.
Don't be afraid to ride the lightning.

765
00:51:41,043 --> 00:51:43,683
In the face.

766
00:51:46,466 --> 00:51:48,397
He's still up.

767
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:52,045
Everybody relax. Take it easy.

768
00:51:52,883 --> 00:51:55,563
We've seen it before. He just
need a little extra charge.

769
00:51:56,672 --> 00:51:57,355
There we go.

770
00:51:59,634 --> 00:52:02,231
Somebody's big boys. You
gotta give them two shots.

771
00:52:03,024 --> 00:52:04,964
Alright, kids. Who wants to
get their fingerprints done?

772
00:52:05,549 --> 00:52:06,364
Come on. Let's go.

773
00:52:07,743 --> 00:52:09,120
Fuck those guys.

774
00:52:09,646 --> 00:52:10,851
Do you hear me?

775
00:52:11,064 --> 00:52:13,550
That was bullshit. I'm telling
everybody we stole a cop car.

776
00:52:13,845 --> 00:52:15,735
He let us go.
Who cares.

777
00:52:15,994 --> 00:52:19,428
I care. You can't just do that.
You can't just tase people.

778
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:22,037
Because you think it's funny.

779
00:52:22,176 --> 00:52:23,565
That's police brutality.

780
00:52:27,434 --> 00:52:31,661
I'm getting a soda. Do you
guys want anything?/ No.

781
00:52:35,685 --> 00:52:38,231
One man doesn't shut up.
Jesus Christ.

782
00:52:40,812 --> 00:52:42,512
Alan, you okay?

783
00:52:44,117 --> 00:52:45,910
I'm just worried.

784
00:52:47,483 --> 00:52:49,255
What if something happened
to Doug. Something bad.

785
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,084
Come on, you can't think like that.

786
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,859
What if he's dead?

787
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,244
I can't afford to lose anybody
close to me again. It hurts too much.

788
00:52:58,241 --> 00:52:59,934
I was so upset when my grandpa died.

789
00:53:00,331 --> 00:53:01,324
I'm sorry. How did he die?

790
00:53:02,175 --> 00:53:04,162
World War II./
Die in the battle?

791
00:53:04,958 --> 00:53:08,203
No he was skiing in Vermont.
It was just during World War II.

792
00:53:09,416 --> 00:53:11,990
Alan, Doug is fine.

793
00:53:12,466 --> 00:53:14,782
Why hasn't he called?/ I don't
know, but we're gonna figure it out.

794
00:53:16,377 --> 00:53:20,674
I'll tell you another thing. 6 to 1
odds are our car is beat to shit.

795
00:53:20,674 --> 00:53:21,675
Stu, not now.

796
00:53:21,936 --> 00:53:24,794
Seriously, how much do you
wanna bet? It's like fucked up.

797
00:53:24,794 --> 00:53:28,282
That's enough. Alan is seriously
worried. Let's not freak him out anymore.

798
00:53:32,915 --> 00:53:33,874
I'm sorry, Alan.

799
00:53:35,446 --> 00:53:39,077
We'll search the car for clues,
and everything's gonna be okay.

800
00:53:40,541 --> 00:53:42,385
Oh, shit. I can't see that.

801
00:53:45,209 --> 00:53:46,658
I'm not looking.

802
00:53:49,786 --> 00:53:50,729
Oh, thank god.

803
00:53:54,567 --> 00:53:55,924
It's gonna be alright.

804
00:54:02,897 --> 00:54:04,167
Anything?

805
00:54:04,487 --> 00:54:05,527
I got a cigar.

806
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:11,319
I found a black shoes./
A women shoes?/ I don't know.

807
00:54:11,704 --> 00:54:14,718
Whose are those?/ I don't
know. It's men size 6.

808
00:54:15,237 --> 00:54:16,022
It's weird.

809
00:54:16,398 --> 00:54:17,542
What is this, a snake skin?

810
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:19,461
Oh, come on.

811
00:54:19,857 --> 00:54:21,117
That's a used condom, Alan.

812
00:54:23,836 --> 00:54:24,709
Get it out of the car.

813
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,817
I got a jizz on me.

814
00:54:31,696 --> 00:54:32,755
Get it out.

815
00:54:35,075 --> 00:54:36,654
Oh, my god.

816
00:54:37,271 --> 00:54:40,733
What the fuck, man? We gotta
get this shit together, guys.

817
00:54:43,657 --> 00:54:44,400
What was that?

818
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:47,217
It's in the trunk.

819
00:54:47,565 --> 00:54:48,847
Doug's in the trunk.

820
00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:52,942
Holy shit.

821
00:54:53,305 --> 00:54:54,839
Open it./ Okay.

822
00:55:01,848 --> 00:55:03,662
Please stop.

823
00:55:12,683 --> 00:55:13,755
I'm with you.

824
00:55:14,472 --> 00:55:15,650
You gonna fuck on me?

825
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:17,035
Nobody's gonna fuck on you.

826
00:55:17,293 --> 00:55:20,185
We're on your side. I hate
Godzilla. I hate him too.

827
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,184
He destroys cities.

828
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:24,627
Please.

829
00:55:25,203 --> 00:55:27,710
This isn't your fault.
I'll get you some pants.

830
00:55:33,368 --> 00:55:34,974
What the fuck was that?

831
00:55:37,648 --> 00:55:38,716
I have an internal bleeding.

832
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:40,965
Please call 911.

833
00:55:42,299 --> 00:55:47,588
That's some fucked up shit.
Who was that guy? He's so mean.

834
00:55:50,297 --> 00:55:51,819
Guys, there's something
I need to tell you.

835
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:57,190
Last night on the roof,
before we went out...

836
00:55:58,909 --> 00:56:01,216
I slipped something in our Yagermeister.

837
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:02,941
What?

838
00:56:03,376 --> 00:56:05,433
I'm sorry. I fuged up, guys.

839
00:56:06,505 --> 00:56:07,772
You drugged us?

840
00:56:08,225 --> 00:56:11,707
No, I didn't drug you.
I was told it was ecstasy.

841
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:14,456
Who told you it was ecstasy?

842
00:56:15,495 --> 00:56:17,273
The guy I bought it
from at the liquor store.

843
00:56:17,620 --> 00:56:18,961
Why would you give us ecstasy?

844
00:56:19,329 --> 00:56:20,577
Because I wanted everybody
to have a good time...

845
00:56:20,993 --> 00:56:24,029
And I knew you guys wouldn't
take it. It was just one hit each.

846
00:56:24,334 --> 00:56:26,142
I used to do 3 hits at night.

847
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:29,833
But it wasn't ecstasy, Alan.
It was roofies.

848
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,952
You think I knew that, Stu?

849
00:56:32,433 --> 00:56:35,171
The guy I bought it from seemed
like he was a real straight shooter.

850
00:56:35,331 --> 00:56:38,689
I'm sorry. You mean the drug dealer at
the liquor store wasn't a good guy?

851
00:56:38,972 --> 00:56:41,085
Let's just calm down./
You fuckin' calm down.

852
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:45,285
He drugged us. I lost a tooth.
I married a whore.

853
00:56:45,486 --> 00:56:47,046
How dare you. She's a nice lady.

854
00:56:47,318 --> 00:56:50,615
You're such a fuckin' moron./
Your language is offensive.

855
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,679
Fuck you.

856
00:56:52,454 --> 00:56:53,994
Let's just take a deep breath.

857
00:56:55,941 --> 00:56:57,460
This is a good thing, guys.

858
00:56:57,856 --> 00:57:00,664
At least it's not some strangers
drugged us for god knows what reason.

859
00:57:01,497 --> 00:57:04,169
You're right, Phil.
It's totally a good thing.

860
00:57:05,514 --> 00:57:06,847
We're so much better off now.

861
00:57:08,273 --> 00:57:11,059
Here's something I would
like to remind you two of.

862
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:15,913
Our best friend, Doug, is probably
face down in a ditch right now...

863
00:57:16,177 --> 00:57:18,836
With a meth head,
butt-fucking his corpse.

864
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:20,949
That's highly unlikely./
It's true.

865
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:24,397
This is not help. Let's get
our shit together, guys.

866
00:57:25,628 --> 00:57:28,731
Let's go back to the hotel and
I'm gonna make a couple calls...

867
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:30,826
Maybe Doug's back there.
Maybe he's asleep.

868
00:57:31,129 --> 00:57:32,794
Come on. Let's go.

869
00:57:33,556 --> 00:57:35,416
Stu, little help?

870
00:57:35,928 --> 00:57:37,274
Shut up.

871
00:57:41,385 --> 00:57:45,463
Oh, god. Are you okay?
Alan, I'm sorry.

872
00:57:56,863 --> 00:57:58,948
Wait, guys.

873
00:57:59,229 --> 00:58:00,897
What about the tiger?
What if he got out?

874
00:58:02,382 --> 00:58:04,466
I keep forgetting about
the god damned tiger.

875
00:58:06,113 --> 00:58:07,548
How the fuck did he get in there?

876
00:58:08,075 --> 00:58:10,872
I don't know. Because I don't remember.

877
00:58:11,265 --> 00:58:12,952
Stu, keep it down.

878
00:58:13,609 --> 00:58:16,393
It's one of the side-effects
of roofies, is memory loss.

879
00:58:18,082 --> 00:58:20,813
You are literally too stupid to insult.

880
00:58:21,758 --> 00:58:22,410
Thank you.

881
00:58:28,786 --> 00:58:29,872
Hey, come on.

882
00:58:34,044 --> 00:58:35,098
Did we leave the music on?

883
00:58:39,562 --> 00:58:41,235
Don't make any sudden movements.

884
00:58:44,937 --> 00:58:46,252
Who the hell are you?/
Who the hell are you?

885
00:58:46,536 --> 00:58:48,308
Quiet.

886
00:58:51,543 --> 00:58:52,495
Mike Tyson?

887
00:58:54,475 --> 00:58:56,279
This is my favorite
part coming in right now.

888
00:59:00,565 --> 00:59:05,489
I can feel it coming in the air tonight.

889
00:59:05,524 --> 00:59:06,817
The chorus line, guys.

890
00:59:06,818 --> 00:59:08,232
Oh, Lord.

891
00:59:10,374 --> 00:59:15,348
But I've been waiting for
this moment for all my life.

892
00:59:15,348 --> 00:59:16,393
One more time, guys.

893
00:59:16,681 --> 00:59:18,715
Oh, Lord.

894
00:59:23,767 --> 00:59:24,687
Why did you do that?

895
00:59:25,671 --> 00:59:28,846
Mr. Tyson would like to know why
is his tiger in your bathroom.

896
00:59:29,171 --> 00:59:31,835
Hold on. That was
completely unnecessary.

897
00:59:32,063 --> 00:59:34,477
I'm a huge fan. When
you knocked out holmes...

898
00:59:34,545 --> 00:59:35,375
Explain.

899
00:59:37,569 --> 00:59:40,178
We were drugged last night. We
have no memory of what happened.

900
00:59:40,552 --> 00:59:43,490
It's true. We got into all
kinds of trouble last night.

901
00:59:43,763 --> 00:59:45,255
And now we can't find our friend.

902
00:59:45,627 --> 00:59:48,924
And if you wanna kill us, just go ahead,
because I don't even care anymore.

903
00:59:48,924 --> 00:59:50,572
Stu, what are you talking about?/
I don't care.

904
00:59:50,973 --> 00:59:52,615
Why the fuck do you
want to steal his tiger?

905
00:59:53,483 --> 00:59:56,057
We tend to do dumb shit
when we're fucked up.

906
00:59:57,079 --> 00:59:58,465
I don't believe you guys.

907
00:59:58,754 --> 01:00:00,342
Wait, how did you guys find us?

908
01:00:00,728 --> 01:00:04,421
One of you dropped your jacket, found
it in the tiger's cage this morning.

909
01:00:04,673 --> 01:00:05,533
That's Doug's.

910
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:09,342
Yeah, Doug. His wallet
and his room keys in there.

911
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:11,560
That's our missing friend./
I don't give a fuck.

912
01:00:12,497 --> 01:00:13,390
Did you guys see him?

913
01:00:13,828 --> 01:00:14,518
I was vast asleep.

914
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,560
Because if he was up, this shit
wouldn't had gone down so smoothly.

915
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,728
Maybe the tiger would
ate them up like Omar.

916
01:00:20,128 --> 01:00:20,950
Respect.

917
01:00:21,397 --> 01:00:22,771
What happened to Omar?

918
01:00:23,034 --> 01:00:24,645
Don't worry about Omar.
He's not with us no more.

919
01:00:26,931 --> 01:00:29,330
I know this is asking a lot, but do you
think there's anyway that we could go...

920
01:00:29,715 --> 01:00:32,508
To your house and look around to see
if there's any clues for our friend?

921
01:00:32,942 --> 01:00:36,139
Absolutely. How else do you think
we're gonna get the tiger back anyway?

922
01:00:37,422 --> 01:00:38,072
Come on, Champ.

923
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:39,559
I'm sorry?

924
01:00:40,246 --> 01:00:44,145
We're not gonna put it in the Bentley.
You brought it here, you bring it back.

925
01:00:44,973 --> 01:00:47,013
What do you think?
About 40 minutes?

926
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,569
Don't make me come back for him.

927
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:57,151
That was Mike Tyson./
No shit that was Mike Tyson.

928
01:00:57,446 --> 01:00:59,106
I'm just saying,
he's still got it.

929
01:01:02,084 --> 01:01:02,911
Are you okay?

930
01:01:04,992 --> 01:01:05,605
Where did he get him?

931
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:14,509
This does not seem fair.

932
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:17,468
It's rock, paper, scissors.
There's nothing more fair.

933
01:01:18,046 --> 01:01:19,330
Alan should do it.

934
01:01:19,596 --> 01:01:22,947
Alan took a punch from Mike
Tyson, come on. For Doug.

935
01:01:24,294 --> 01:01:27,055
Why are you peppering the steak.
You don't know if tigers like pepper.

936
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:29,479
Tigers love pepper.
They hate cinnamon.

937
01:01:32,963 --> 01:01:35,173
Phil, just do it.
You should do it.

938
01:01:35,469 --> 01:01:38,904
I would, but you lost.
It wouldn't be right.

939
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:43,928
I jammed 5 roofies in there.
Just go in there and throw it to him.

940
01:01:45,371 --> 01:01:46,978
Fine.

941
01:01:48,661 --> 01:01:50,035
Make sure he eats the whole thing.

942
01:02:01,858 --> 01:02:02,874
Hey, kitty.

943
01:02:04,556 --> 01:02:07,911
Hey, sweety. It's okay.
A little snack for you.

944
01:02:08,645 --> 01:02:11,118
We want you to eat this, okay?

945
01:02:12,472 --> 01:02:14,441
Just have a little...

946
01:02:21,398 --> 01:02:22,183
What do we do now?

947
01:02:23,404 --> 01:02:24,640
We wait.

948
01:02:34,671 --> 01:02:41,542
What do tigers dream off
when they take a little tiger snooze.

949
01:02:41,956 --> 01:02:48,687
Do they dream of mauling zebras
or Halle Berry in her Catwoman suite.

950
01:02:49,526 --> 01:02:54,302
Don't you worry, you pretty stripped-head
we're gonna get you back to Tyson...

951
01:02:54,302 --> 01:02:56,489
And your cozy tiger bed.

952
01:02:56,489 --> 01:02:59,750
And then we're gonna
find our best friend Doug...

953
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:03,403
And then we're gonna give
him a best friend hug.

954
01:03:03,403 --> 01:03:10,485
Doug, Doug, oh.. Doug,
Dougie-Doug, Doug.

955
01:03:12,299 --> 01:03:17,753
But if he's been murdered
by crystal meth tweakers...

956
01:03:19,038 --> 01:03:21,086
Well then we're shit out of luck.

957
01:03:27,882 --> 01:03:29,389
By the end we're all gonna die.

958
01:03:40,299 --> 01:03:41,657
Watch it.

959
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,609
That's his nose.

960
01:03:56,674 --> 01:04:00,213
Hey guys, when's the next
Haley's comet?

961
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:02,948
Who cares, man./
Do you know, Stu?

962
01:04:03,976 --> 01:04:07,064
I don't think it's for another
60 years or something.

963
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:10,223
It's not tonight, right?/
No. I don't think so.

964
01:04:10,484 --> 01:04:11,904
But you don't know for sure?

965
01:04:12,193 --> 01:04:13,192
No.

966
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:16,891
I got this cousin, Marcus who saw
one he said it blew his mind.

967
01:04:17,016 --> 01:04:19,815
I wanna make sure I'll never
ever miss out on Hailie's comet.

968
01:04:20,182 --> 01:04:22,132
So if you guys now
there's gonna be one...

969
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:37,132
Get out.

970
01:04:44,434 --> 01:04:44,934
Oh, my god.

971
01:04:45,279 --> 01:04:47,151
Stu, he got me.

972
01:04:47,506 --> 01:04:49,739
You got clawed./
I'm bleeding.

973
01:05:09,003 --> 01:05:11,986
I can't do it./ Get your fuckin' hand
back in there. You're steering the car.

974
01:05:12,021 --> 01:05:12,852
I'm too nervous.

975
01:05:12,852 --> 01:05:16,446
Alan, we need you, buddy.
It's your time to shine, okay?

976
01:05:18,523 --> 01:05:19,968
My dad's gonna kill me.

977
01:05:19,968 --> 01:05:21,018
That's it./
That's good.

978
01:05:21,224 --> 01:05:23,435
Keep it straight.

979
01:05:32,988 --> 01:05:34,289
You're late.

980
01:05:34,289 --> 01:05:36,179
Whatever, man. We had
to push at the last mile.

981
01:05:36,695 --> 01:05:39,386
Come on in. Mike's got
something he wants to show you.

982
01:05:44,829 --> 01:05:46,994
Things got out of control, man.
You gotta put it down.

983
01:05:50,542 --> 01:05:53,020
When we got back, we took a
look at the security cameras.

984
01:05:53,167 --> 01:05:53,742
Great.

985
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:02,540
Oh, it's Doug./
Thank god he's alive.

986
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:05,413
That's our buddy. That's
who we've been missing.

987
01:06:06,569 --> 01:06:07,727
We're all best friends.

988
01:06:07,727 --> 01:06:10,054
Why don't you just pay attention.
I don't have all night.

989
01:06:10,511 --> 01:06:11,478
Yeah, of course.

990
01:06:16,754 --> 01:06:17,676
That's me. I'm on TV.

991
01:06:18,405 --> 01:06:19,869
I've never been on TV before.

992
01:06:21,821 --> 01:06:23,772
Really?
Really, Alan?

993
01:06:30,583 --> 01:06:32,457
<i>You're gonna overflow the pool, man.</i>

994
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:36,270
Maybe, I...
Should I wait outside?

995
01:06:36,401 --> 01:06:37,764
I think that's a good idea.

996
01:06:40,554 --> 01:06:42,279
Don't touch anything out there either.

997
01:06:43,729 --> 01:06:46,721
He's not our good...
We don't know him that well.

998
01:06:52,114 --> 01:06:54,056
By the way, man, where did
you get that cop car from?

999
01:06:54,402 --> 01:06:57,330
We stole it from this dumbass cops.

1000
01:06:57,365 --> 01:06:58,609
Nice.

1001
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:02,834
High five there.

1002
01:07:06,268 --> 01:07:11,149
I have to say, I've never seen a more
beautiful, elegant, regal creature.

1003
01:07:11,409 --> 01:07:13,533
<i>Check it out, Stu.
Fuck this tiger.</i>

1004
01:07:13,919 --> 01:07:15,707
Oh, my god.
It's awful.

1005
01:07:19,543 --> 01:07:21,453
Who does shit like that, man?

1006
01:07:22,086 --> 01:07:24,001
Someone who has a lot
of issues obviously.

1007
01:07:24,379 --> 01:07:25,274
I'm a sick man.

1008
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:30,871
That's all we got.

1009
01:07:32,013 --> 01:07:35,405
This was, hugely helpful.

1010
01:07:35,656 --> 01:07:40,966
Because now we know that our buddy
Doug was with us at 3.30 totally alive.

1011
01:07:41,303 --> 01:07:43,246
Thanks again, champ.

1012
01:07:43,565 --> 01:07:47,150
We're so sorry we stole your tiger.

1013
01:07:47,208 --> 01:07:50,736
Don't worry about it. Like you said, we
all do dumb shit when we're fucked up.

1014
01:07:54,523 --> 01:07:55,547
I did say that.

1015
01:07:59,977 --> 01:08:04,846
Everyone says Mike Tyson is a badass,
but I think he's kind of a sweetheart.

1016
01:08:05,140 --> 01:08:06,510
I think he's mean.

1017
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:10,762
I think it's officially
time we call Tracy.

1018
01:08:11,251 --> 01:08:15,247
Hallelujah. Finally. Phil says
something that make sense.

1019
01:08:15,344 --> 01:08:18,395
We don't have much of a choice. And
who knows maybe she's heard from Doug.

1020
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:19,642
That's what I've been
saying this whole time.

1021
01:08:21,496 --> 01:08:23,636
We just need to be completely
honest and tell her everything.

1022
01:08:26,564 --> 01:08:27,684
We don't need to tell her everything.

1023
01:08:28,071 --> 01:08:31,781
We can leave out the stuff
about me marrying a hooker.

1024
01:08:32,292 --> 01:08:33,566
Just stay focus on Doug.

1025
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:36,027
What am I gonna tell
my dad about this car?

1026
01:08:36,351 --> 01:08:38,066
Alan, relax. It's just the inside.

1027
01:08:38,378 --> 01:08:40,166
I got a guy in L.A
who's great with interior.

1028
01:08:52,313 --> 01:08:54,273
Oh, Jesus./
Oh, my god.

1029
01:08:58,896 --> 01:08:59,492
Are you guys okay?

1030
01:09:09,602 --> 01:09:12,022
I know that guy. That's
the guy from the trunk.

1031
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:16,462
Get out of the car, please.

1032
01:09:18,337 --> 01:09:19,976
Those are the guys that shot Eddie.

1033
01:09:42,659 --> 01:09:47,365
I want my purse back, assholes.

1034
01:09:48,373 --> 01:09:51,208
Your purse?/ That's not
a purse, it's a satchel.

1035
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:52,986
It's a purse, okay?

1036
01:09:53,294 --> 01:09:55,970
And you steal from wrong guy.

1037
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,901
Wait a second.
We stole from you?

1038
01:10:00,549 --> 01:10:03,705
We don't remember anything
that happened last night.

1039
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:05,715
So help us out a little here.

1040
01:10:06,270 --> 01:10:09,498
Apparently, you guys met at
the crabs table late last night.

1041
01:10:09,918 --> 01:10:12,783
You're on your real heater
when you played your hot streak.

1042
01:10:13,218 --> 01:10:14,718
You ended up winning
just under 80 grand.

1043
01:10:15,061 --> 01:10:16,658
No shit. 80 grand. Nice.

1044
01:10:16,995 --> 01:10:17,616
That's good.

1045
01:10:18,374 --> 01:10:21,222
You put the chips in his purse,
and then you guys took off with it.

1046
01:10:21,485 --> 01:10:22,833
That doesn't sound like us.

1047
01:10:23,023 --> 01:10:26,322
Mine had 80 thousand dollars inside.

1048
01:10:27,158 --> 01:10:29,066
And this one?
Nothing.

1049
01:10:29,318 --> 01:10:30,724
Hey, there's skittles in there.

1050
01:10:35,071 --> 01:10:37,087
Don't let the beard fool you.
He's a child.

1051
01:10:37,545 --> 01:10:39,255
He's funny because he's fat.

1052
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:43,303
This was obviously a very
simple misunderstanding.

1053
01:10:43,303 --> 01:10:45,916
Alan picked up the wrong
purse, it's no big deal.

1054
01:10:46,172 --> 01:10:50,190
If it's no big deal, why
when I come after you guys...

1055
01:10:50,298 --> 01:10:53,954
He starts screaming like crazy,
and throw me in trunk.

1056
01:10:54,198 --> 01:10:55,124
I did that?

1057
01:10:55,649 --> 01:10:59,059
You said he was your lucky charm.
And you wanna take him home with you.

1058
01:11:01,234 --> 01:11:03,246
Lucky charm./
That's just funny.

1059
01:11:05,387 --> 01:11:06,638
Fuck you.

1060
01:11:08,209 --> 01:11:12,336
If you want to see your friend again,
you get me my 80 grand.

1061
01:11:12,678 --> 01:11:13,729
What?/
Our friend?

1062
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:14,695
You have Doug?

1063
01:11:18,103 --> 01:11:19,537
Doug.

1064
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:26,287
Chill out, goatie.

1065
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:28,205
Alright. Fine.

1066
01:11:28,425 --> 01:11:29,947
What do you want?

1067
01:11:30,537 --> 01:11:32,684
Not so good now.

1068
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:33,826
Douchebag.

1069
01:11:35,312 --> 01:11:37,929
We're very sorry, but
this is an easy fix.

1070
01:11:37,929 --> 01:11:39,119
Alan, where's his purse?

1071
01:11:39,521 --> 01:11:41,417
I don't know./ You said it
was in hotel room, right?

1072
01:11:41,804 --> 01:11:42,567
We can get it.

1073
01:11:42,919 --> 01:11:45,731
We can get you. We can even
write you check right now.

1074
01:11:46,011 --> 01:11:47,322
No chances. Cash only.

1075
01:11:47,664 --> 01:11:48,995
There's a person in there.

1076
01:11:49,387 --> 01:11:51,063
Boring.

1077
01:11:51,385 --> 01:11:52,727
Take nap. Come on.

1078
01:11:56,419 --> 01:11:59,391
You can't have our friend.
Kindapper!

1079
01:12:05,922 --> 01:12:06,813
Run me over.

1080
01:12:11,055 --> 01:12:15,974
Bring money to Big Rock
in Mojave Desert at dawn.

1081
01:12:16,392 --> 01:12:21,168
Tooddle-loo, mothafucka.

1082
01:12:23,195 --> 01:12:25,143
At least take the bag off his head.

1083
01:12:38,602 --> 01:12:39,270
Get out of here.

1084
01:12:45,865 --> 01:12:48,311
Guys, I'm telling you I looked
for it this morning before we left.

1085
01:12:48,637 --> 01:12:49,240
It's not anywhere.

1086
01:12:54,747 --> 01:12:56,043
Stu, how much you got in the bank?

1087
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:59,163
About 10 grand, maybe more.
I was gonna use it for the wedding.

1088
01:12:59,405 --> 01:13:01,242
You're already married.
So we're good there.

1089
01:13:01,593 --> 01:13:03,478
Besides not for Melissa.
She's the worst.

1090
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:05,905
Doug told me she had sex with
a pilot or something like that.

1091
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:09,820
It was a bartender on a cruise.
What is wrong with you, people.

1092
01:13:11,151 --> 01:13:13,744
Alan, did you just eat sofa pizza?

1093
01:13:13,891 --> 01:13:14,712
Yeah.

1094
01:13:16,052 --> 01:13:17,673
What are we gonna do.
We're so fucked.

1095
01:13:19,048 --> 01:13:19,844
Hey, guys...

1096
01:13:20,403 --> 01:13:21,506
Do you find it?/
No.

1097
01:13:23,342 --> 01:13:24,445
But check this out.

1098
01:14:12,077 --> 01:14:13,544
Change only.
Ten thousand

1099
01:14:18,262 --> 01:14:20,400
Hey, this seats taken?

1100
01:14:20,918 --> 01:14:21,605
No, feel free.

1101
01:14:27,811 --> 01:14:29,058
Let's play some blackjack.

1102
01:14:51,215 --> 01:14:52,120
That's it.

1103
01:14:52,884 --> 01:14:54,092
Shut up, Vincent.

1104
01:15:01,424 --> 01:15:02,138
I'll stay.

1105
01:15:02,607 --> 01:15:04,395
Fuck you.

1106
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:11,653
Splitting 5.

1107
01:15:13,632 --> 01:15:14,529
Too many.

1108
01:15:19,017 --> 01:15:21,761
I don't even know you. But I'm
gonna tell you, that's dumb.

1109
01:15:24,362 --> 01:15:27,347
Hey, c'mon.
He can't lose.

1110
01:15:29,075 --> 01:15:31,104
I think the pit boss is watching him.

1111
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:50,356
Are you okay?

1112
01:15:50,877 --> 01:15:54,142
I'm such a klutz. I get so nervous
when I gamble. I'm so silly.

1113
01:15:55,163 --> 01:15:56,866
Hold on a bit.

1114
01:15:57,769 --> 01:15:59,838
Let's just take it easy.
This is my wife.

1115
01:16:00,401 --> 01:16:02,359
It's hurting./ Does it hurt?/
Yeah.

1116
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,610
You alright?/ I don't know./
I don't know either.

1117
01:16:06,925 --> 01:16:09,040
I think you're fine.
Let's go./ Really? okay.

1118
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:14,309
Sorry. She's had a little
too much drink.

1119
01:16:14,309 --> 01:16:16,211
Thanks, buddy.
That's for you.

1120
01:16:25,555 --> 01:16:28,433
And 100, 200, 300, 400.

1121
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:32,059
With all this, that's $82,400.

1122
01:16:32,209 --> 01:16:35,517
God damn it.
I don't fucking believe it.

1123
01:16:35,745 --> 01:16:37,931
Alan, you're the man./
You are too, Phil.

1124
01:16:38,992 --> 01:16:41,037
We should come back next week.
Take the whole city down.

1125
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:42,715
I'm free next week.

1126
01:16:43,108 --> 01:16:46,188
Or we could just focus on
getting Doug back right now.

1127
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:49,786
Next week is no good for me.
The Jonas Brothers are in town.

1128
01:16:50,321 --> 01:16:52,624
But any week after that,
it's totally fine.

1129
01:16:53,068 --> 01:16:55,718
I think it's safe to say that our luck
has officially turned around, guys.

1130
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:57,715
We are back, baby.

1131
01:16:58,048 --> 01:16:59,541
We are fuckin' back.

1132
01:16:59,762 --> 01:17:01,624
We are back.
Classic.

1133
01:17:02,271 --> 01:17:05,496
We are back.

1134
01:17:05,755 --> 01:17:08,269
We are getting Doug back.

1135
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:11,251
And we're the three best friends
that anybody could have.

1136
01:17:11,431 --> 01:17:17,738
We're the three best friends
that anyone can have.

1137
01:17:17,738 --> 01:17:20,902
And we'll never, ever, ever,
ever, ever, leave each other.

1138
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:24,070
We're the best three friend
that anybody could have.

1139
01:17:24,242 --> 01:17:27,184
I mean the three best
friend that anybody can have.

1140
01:17:48,242 --> 01:17:49,644
Now what?

1141
01:17:49,777 --> 01:17:50,497
Give him the signal.

1142
01:17:50,936 --> 01:17:51,632
What signal.

1143
01:17:51,956 --> 01:17:53,743
Flash your lights.
Let him know it's on.

1144
01:17:54,052 --> 01:17:55,513
What's on?

1145
01:17:55,861 --> 01:17:56,825
The deal.

1146
01:17:57,200 --> 01:18:01,389
Of course it's on. We just drove 30
miles into the desert. He knows it's on.

1147
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:02,702
Phil, just do something.

1148
01:18:04,707 --> 01:18:05,246
Fine.

1149
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:10,779
See?

1150
01:18:11,363 --> 01:18:12,515
Alright. Let's go.

1151
01:18:26,061 --> 01:18:28,604
Funny. The fat guy
fall on face.

1152
01:18:28,684 --> 01:18:29,811
You okay?

1153
01:18:30,597 --> 01:18:33,216
Alright. We got the money.
80 grand. Cash.

1154
01:18:33,497 --> 01:18:35,410
Throw it over.
Then I give you Doug.

1155
01:18:36,965 --> 01:18:40,604
I'm sorry. First of all, good morning.
We didn't catch your name last night.

1156
01:18:40,939 --> 01:18:43,722
Mr. Chow.
Leslie Chow.

1157
01:18:44,030 --> 01:18:46,132
Mr. Chow. It is a pleasure.
My name's Stu.

1158
01:18:46,979 --> 01:18:51,599
We would very much appreciate
an opportunity to see Doug...

1159
01:18:51,599 --> 01:18:56,550
Before we give you the money just to
verify that he's okay. If that's cool.

1160
01:18:56,781 --> 01:18:58,865
Of course, Stu. That is cool.

1161
01:19:10,638 --> 01:19:11,462
Okay.

1162
01:19:11,704 --> 01:19:16,635
See? He fine. Now give
me money or I shoot him...

1163
01:19:16,635 --> 01:19:19,368
And I shoot all you motherfuckers.

1164
01:19:19,368 --> 01:19:22,828
And then we take it.
Your choice, bitches.

1165
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:25,240
Give him the money, Stu./
Okay.

1166
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:36,904
It's all there./
Let him go.

1167
01:19:40,827 --> 01:19:42,276
Alright, take it easy.

1168
01:19:43,973 --> 01:19:44,859
Ta-da.

1169
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:48,640
Is this some kind of a
joke? Who the hell is this?

1170
01:19:48,763 --> 01:19:49,637
That is not Doug.

1171
01:19:50,022 --> 01:19:52,622
What are you talking
about, willies? That him.

1172
01:19:53,021 --> 01:19:55,633
No. I'm sorry, Mr. Chow.
That's not our friend.

1173
01:19:56,156 --> 01:19:58,308
The Doug we're looking for is a white.

1174
01:20:00,468 --> 01:20:03,185
I told you you had the
wrong guy, little boy.

1175
01:20:03,186 --> 01:20:05,902
Damn, Alan. What the
fuck you got me into?

1176
01:20:06,166 --> 01:20:06,865
You know him?

1177
01:20:07,263 --> 01:20:09,747
Yeah. This is the guy that sell
me the bad drugs. How you doin'?

1178
01:20:09,747 --> 01:20:11,524
I ain't sellin' you
no fuckin' bad drugs.

1179
01:20:11,969 --> 01:20:14,788
Wait. He sold you the roofilin?

1180
01:20:15,162 --> 01:20:17,129
Roofilin? I sell no roofilin.

1181
01:20:17,262 --> 01:20:18,982
Who gives a shit! Where is Doug?

1182
01:20:19,446 --> 01:20:20,784
I am Doug.

1183
01:20:21,176 --> 01:20:24,112
Your name's Doug?/
Yes, I'm Doug.

1184
01:20:24,450 --> 01:20:26,391
His name's Doug too. Classic mixed up.

1185
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:27,483
Come on.

1186
01:20:27,978 --> 01:20:30,436
Hey, Chow! You gave us the wrong Doug.

1187
01:20:30,836 --> 01:20:32,198
Not my problem.

1188
01:20:32,497 --> 01:20:35,739
Fuck that shit. Now you give us our 80
grand back and take him with you.

1189
01:20:36,076 --> 01:20:37,486
No. Come on, man. I'll be your Doug.

1190
01:20:37,776 --> 01:20:41,142
Oh, yeah. Okay. I take him back.

1191
01:20:41,142 --> 01:20:44,036
Right after you suck on
this little Chinese nuts.

1192
01:20:44,488 --> 01:20:45,752
Oh, that's nasty.

1193
01:20:46,306 --> 01:20:47,660
How that sound?

1194
01:20:48,861 --> 01:20:51,361
So long, gay boys.

1195
01:20:51,850 --> 01:20:52,632
Wait a second.

1196
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:54,883
He's a nasty little motherfucker.

1197
01:20:55,452 --> 01:20:58,224
Did you happen to get any ecstasy?/
No, I have no fuckin' ecstasy.

1198
01:20:59,162 --> 01:21:00,051
God, damn it!

1199
01:21:01,057 --> 01:21:02,125
Gosh, darn it!

1200
01:21:02,398 --> 01:21:03,211
Shit!

1201
01:21:03,446 --> 01:21:04,360
Shoot!

1202
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:15,500
Hello.

1203
01:21:16,117 --> 01:21:17,107
Tracy, it's Phil.

1204
01:21:17,434 --> 01:21:20,221
Phil, where the hell are
you guys. I'm freaking out.

1205
01:21:27,037 --> 01:21:28,561
Thanks for the lift back to town.

1206
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:32,462
I got a question for you./
What's that?

1207
01:21:32,758 --> 01:21:34,141
How did you wind up in Chow's car?

1208
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:37,467
That crazy asshole
kidnapped me yesterday.

1209
01:21:37,839 --> 01:21:39,745
But why? I mean, why you?

1210
01:21:40,077 --> 01:21:43,715
Cuz he thought I was with you guys,
cuz we all hangin' over at the Bellagio.

1211
01:21:44,020 --> 01:21:44,389
What?

1212
01:21:44,776 --> 01:21:45,513
We were at the Bellagio?

1213
01:21:45,974 --> 01:21:47,570
Yeah. We were shooting
crabs. You don't remember?

1214
01:21:47,834 --> 01:21:51,994
No. We don't remember.
Because some dick drug dealer...

1215
01:21:51,994 --> 01:21:54,891
Sold him roofilin and
told him it was ecstasy.

1216
01:21:55,278 --> 01:21:59,584
Roofilin. There you go with that word,
Roofilin. What the hell is a Roofilin?

1217
01:21:59,821 --> 01:22:04,522
Wow. You are the world's
shittiest drug dealer.

1218
01:22:04,522 --> 01:22:10,102
Roofilin, for your information, is the
date rape drug. You sold Alan roofies.

1219
01:22:10,489 --> 01:22:13,526
Oh, shit. I must've mixed
up the bag. My fault, Alan.

1220
01:22:13,792 --> 01:22:16,896
Damn, Marsha's gonna be
pissed off with me on that one.

1221
01:22:17,213 --> 01:22:18,724
Whatever.

1222
01:22:18,986 --> 01:22:21,183
It's funny cuz just the
other day, me and my boy...

1223
01:22:21,184 --> 01:22:23,381
We was wondering why do
you even call'em roofies.

1224
01:22:23,682 --> 01:22:24,803
You know what I'm talking about?

1225
01:22:25,105 --> 01:22:27,080
No. I don't know what
you're talking about.

1226
01:22:27,376 --> 01:22:29,441
Why not floories, right?
Cuz when you take'em...

1227
01:22:29,441 --> 01:22:32,658
You more likely to end up
on the floor than the roof.

1228
01:22:33,533 --> 01:22:36,606
What about groundies. That's
a good new name for'em.

1229
01:22:37,209 --> 01:22:38,023
Or how bout rapies?

1230
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:40,007
Wait, what did you just say?

1231
01:22:40,461 --> 01:22:43,762
Rapies./ Not you. Doug,
what did you say before?

1232
01:22:44,002 --> 01:22:45,011
I said groundies.

1233
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:47,008
No. Before that. You said...

1234
01:22:47,469 --> 01:22:51,673
You're more likely to wind
up on the floor than...

1235
01:22:52,948 --> 01:22:54,961
Listen, Trace, I'm really sorry...

1236
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:58,041
Hello?

1237
01:22:58,963 --> 01:23:00,164
Tracy, it's Stu.

1238
01:23:00,387 --> 01:23:02,313
Stu, talk to me. What's going on?

1239
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:06,365
Nothing. Don't listen to Phil.
He's completely out of his mind.

1240
01:23:06,365 --> 01:23:07,967
He's probably still
drunk from last night.

1241
01:23:08,590 --> 01:23:09,280
Where's Doug?

1242
01:23:09,813 --> 01:23:13,495
He is paying the bill. We just
had a delicious brunch and...

1243
01:23:13,495 --> 01:23:15,481
We're in a big hurry to get
back so we gotta get going.

1244
01:23:15,482 --> 01:23:17,101
Okay, we'll see you soon. Bye.

1245
01:23:20,593 --> 01:23:21,595
What the fuck, man?

1246
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:23,449
I know where Doug is.

1247
01:23:30,959 --> 01:23:32,532
I don't know, man. It just hit me.

1248
01:23:32,933 --> 01:23:35,466
Do you remember when we saw Doug's
mattress impaled on that statue?

1249
01:23:35,755 --> 01:23:36,994
Yeah, it's because we
threw it out the window.

1250
01:23:37,287 --> 01:23:40,096
No it's impossible. You can't
open window in Vegas hotel.

1251
01:23:40,308 --> 01:23:41,709
Then how did it get...

1252
01:23:42,065 --> 01:23:42,934
Oh, my god!

1253
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:45,638
Wait, what's goin on?

1254
01:23:45,924 --> 01:23:47,206
Doug was trying to signal someone.

1255
01:23:47,524 --> 01:23:50,111
Holy shit. How did you figure that out?

1256
01:23:50,374 --> 01:23:51,842
Doug made me realize it.

1257
01:23:52,165 --> 01:23:54,005
Doug?/ Not our Doug. Black Doug.

1258
01:23:54,254 --> 01:23:56,304
Hey, easy with that shit. C'mon./ Sorry.

1259
01:23:57,163 --> 01:23:59,233
Can someone tell me where white Doug is?

1260
01:23:59,607 --> 01:24:00,430
He's on the roof, Alan.

1261
01:24:00,675 --> 01:24:04,128
Yes. He is on the roof. We must have
taken him up there on his mattress...

1262
01:24:04,129 --> 01:24:05,855
As a prank so he'll wake up on the roof.

1263
01:24:06,091 --> 01:24:07,885
It's like that time in summer camp.
Remember when we moved...

1264
01:24:07,885 --> 01:24:10,053
His sleeping bag out in
the jetty in the lake?

1265
01:24:10,520 --> 01:24:12,000
Which was hillarious.

1266
01:24:12,001 --> 01:24:14,962
It's not so funny now, though
cuz we forgot where we put him.

1267
01:24:15,189 --> 01:24:17,010
You guys are fuckin'
retarded. You know that?

1268
01:24:17,286 --> 01:24:20,167
Holy shit. You think
he's still up there?

1269
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:21,316
There's only one way to find out.

1270
01:24:26,434 --> 01:24:28,481
Doug.

1271
01:24:29,722 --> 01:24:30,153
Doug.

1272
01:24:30,726 --> 01:24:32,181
Doug, you up here, buddy?

1273
01:24:36,236 --> 01:24:37,187
Where you at, Doug?

1274
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:48,647
Hey, guys, he's over here.

1275
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:52,176
Phil, we've found him. He's over here.

1276
01:24:56,581 --> 01:24:57,789
He's okay.

1277
01:24:58,384 --> 01:25:00,059
You're okay?

1278
01:25:00,507 --> 01:25:02,730
Oh, god. We gotta go, buddy. Come on.

1279
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:05,223
We've been looking everywhere for you.

1280
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:09,805
What the fuck is going on?

1281
01:25:09,928 --> 01:25:12,602
We can explain everything,
but right now we gotta go.

1282
01:25:12,876 --> 01:25:14,696
Hey, bud. You okay?

1283
01:25:14,696 --> 01:25:16,770
No. Not okay.

1284
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:18,889
You look good. You got
some color. I'm jealous.

1285
01:25:20,089 --> 01:25:21,761
I'm getting married today.

1286
01:25:21,761 --> 01:25:25,215
Yes. Doug, that's why you need
to focus and do everything we say.

1287
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:27,763
Because frankly you're wasting
a little bit of time right now.

1288
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:30,566
You fucking asshole!

1289
01:25:32,115 --> 01:25:34,747
Oh, my skin burns.

1290
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:38,220
It's okay. It's not your fault, Doug.

1291
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:41,553
Don't touch me. Shut up.
All of you shut up.

1292
01:25:43,002 --> 01:25:44,480
Just get me home.

1293
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:47,224
Just get me home.

1294
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,542
What about the one after that?

1295
01:25:51,147 --> 01:25:53,205
You cannot be serious.

1296
01:25:54,968 --> 01:25:58,395
Oh, god damn it. Every
flight to L.A is booked.

1297
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:00,270
What about in the Burbank?/
It's already sold out.

1298
01:26:00,325 --> 01:26:03,193
Fuck. We can't drive there.
The wedding starts in 3.5 hours.

1299
01:26:03,194 --> 01:26:04,628
Alan, where's the car?

1300
01:26:04,862 --> 01:26:05,892
It's on its way.

1301
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:11,052
You know what? We can drive
there. We can make it. Okay?

1302
01:26:14,443 --> 01:26:15,871
Just give me one second.

1303
01:26:16,507 --> 01:26:17,797
We will leave without you.

1304
01:26:20,951 --> 01:26:24,135
Is he missing a tooth?/
Yeah.

1305
01:26:26,985 --> 01:26:30,519
Thanks for helping out last night.
That was so awesome./ Sure.

1306
01:26:32,608 --> 01:26:33,704
Listen, Jade...

1307
01:26:35,368 --> 01:26:38,027
You don't have to say it.
I totally understand.

1308
01:26:38,027 --> 01:26:40,349
This whole thing was stupid.

1309
01:26:42,702 --> 01:26:43,810
It was stupid, wasn't it?

1310
01:26:51,403 --> 01:26:52,228
This is yours.

1311
01:26:52,623 --> 01:26:57,183
Thank you. I can't believe I gave
my grandmother's holocaust ring...

1312
01:26:57,183 --> 01:26:59,921
To someone I just met.
What was I thinking?

1313
01:27:00,217 --> 01:27:02,567
You were really fucked up./
Clearly.

1314
01:27:04,167 --> 01:27:05,635
You did pull out your own tooth.

1315
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:08,580
I pulled out my tooth?

1316
01:27:09,986 --> 01:27:11,685
Why did I pull out my own tooth?

1317
01:27:12,218 --> 01:27:16,409
Alan bet you you weren't a good enough
dentist to pull out your own tooth.

1318
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:21,296
Okay. Of course he did.

1319
01:27:22,069 --> 01:27:22,805
But you won.

1320
01:27:24,243 --> 01:27:27,211
Yeah. Clearly.

1321
01:27:27,211 --> 01:27:29,606
That's victory, right there.

1322
01:27:29,893 --> 01:27:30,593
This should go down.

1323
01:27:30,995 --> 01:27:33,416
It's good./ No. Safety first.

1324
01:27:33,742 --> 01:27:34,669
Alan, it's fine. It's down.

1325
01:27:35,341 --> 01:27:37,384
No. I gotta get it down first.

1326
01:27:39,726 --> 01:27:41,356
Don't mess the car up.

1327
01:27:41,356 --> 01:27:42,447
You're gonna mess the car up.

1328
01:27:43,376 --> 01:27:44,680
What are you doing next weekend?

1329
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:46,609
I don't know. Working. Why?

1330
01:27:46,959 --> 01:27:50,227
Cuz I was thinking maybe I'll come
back to get us to dinner or something.

1331
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:52,641
Really? Like a date?

1332
01:27:52,898 --> 01:27:56,908
Yeah, like a date. Only the one
that I, hopefully I remember.

1333
01:27:58,396 --> 01:27:59,210
Sounds good.

1334
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:04,501
Stu./ Stu.

1335
01:28:04,948 --> 01:28:06,231
C'mon./ C'mon.

1336
01:28:08,458 --> 01:28:09,148
I gotta go.

1337
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:11,477
Okay. Bye.

1338
01:28:14,856 --> 01:28:16,061
Bye./ Bye.

1339
01:28:21,384 --> 01:28:21,779
Alright, let's go.

1340
01:28:42,288 --> 01:28:44,827
At least the trip
wasn't a total disaster.

1341
01:28:45,118 --> 01:28:46,323
What makes you say that?

1342
01:28:46,605 --> 01:28:49,130
When I woke up on the
roof, I happened to find...

1343
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:52,436
$80,000 worth of Bellagio
chips in my pocket.

1344
01:28:52,742 --> 01:28:54,193
Oh, my god.

1345
01:28:54,771 --> 01:28:57,211
Looks like we're going home
with some money, boys.

1346
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,941
Here he comes. That's him.

1347
01:29:19,949 --> 01:29:22,702
Hey, Victor./
What's up, Alan?

1348
01:29:26,096 --> 01:29:28,462
Wow, look out!/
Oh, shit.

1349
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:35,884
Thanks, Vic./ Adios.

1350
01:29:36,533 --> 01:29:38,580
Who the hell was that guy?/
That's my buddy.

1351
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:18,967
Sorry, It took us on a
really crazy route.

1352
01:30:41,887 --> 01:30:44,139
How's my hair?/
It's good.

1353
01:30:44,139 --> 01:30:45,339
Is it cool like Phil's?

1354
01:30:46,217 --> 01:30:47,091
It's classic Phil.

1355
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:54,063
She looks beautiful, man.

1356
01:31:01,776 --> 01:31:03,229
Sorry I'm late.

1357
01:31:04,081 --> 01:31:04,981
Vegas.

1358
01:31:10,502 --> 01:31:13,951
Where were you?
And why are you so red?

1359
01:31:14,779 --> 01:31:17,943
Honey, it's a long story.

1360
01:31:19,459 --> 01:31:25,038
We are gathered here today because of
the strength of love and the promises...

1361
01:31:25,038 --> 01:31:27,540
All I know is, I am so sorry.

1362
01:31:28,846 --> 01:31:31,294
And I promise for as long
as we're married...

1363
01:31:31,295 --> 01:31:35,048
I'll never, ever put you
through anything like this again.

1364
01:31:36,942 --> 01:31:38,229
Can you forgive me?

1365
01:31:44,646 --> 01:31:48,220
Yeah. Uh-huh. So seductive.

1366
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:53,154
I take you to the candy shop.
I let you lick the lollipop.

1367
01:31:53,723 --> 01:31:56,222
Go ahead, girl don't you stop.

1368
01:31:56,448 --> 01:31:58,955
Keep on going until you hit the spot.

1369
01:31:59,158 --> 01:32:00,981
You can have it your way.

1370
01:32:01,305 --> 01:32:05,880
How do you want it? Gonna back that
thing up or should I push up on it?

1371
01:32:06,040 --> 01:32:08,813
Break it down for you now baby it's simple.

1372
01:32:08,967 --> 01:32:11,624
You be a nympho, I be a nympho.

1373
01:32:11,948 --> 01:32:14,898
I got the magic stick.
I'm the love doctor.

1374
01:32:24,853 --> 01:32:26,498
Daddy!/
Hey, my man.

1375
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,406
Excuse me. But I'm expecting
my husband any minute.

1376
01:32:29,629 --> 01:32:30,340
It's very funny.

1377
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:33,667
Come here. How was
your soccer game?

1378
01:32:33,864 --> 01:32:40,046
Go ahead girl don't you stop.
Keep on going until you hit the spot.

1379
01:32:40,668 --> 01:32:43,313
Fuckin' give it to
me baby nice and slow.

1380
01:32:43,475 --> 01:32:46,232
Climb on top ride it
like you in a rodeo.

1381
01:32:50,916 --> 01:32:52,763
Stu? You're avoiding me?

1382
01:32:52,823 --> 01:32:54,570
Hey, Melissa.

1383
01:32:54,917 --> 01:32:57,459
Oh, my god. What happened to your tooth?

1384
01:32:58,559 --> 01:33:01,080
Have you met Alan? Tracy's brother.

1385
01:33:02,317 --> 01:33:03,303
Okay.

1386
01:33:03,665 --> 01:33:05,759
That is disgusting. Why
haven't you returned my calls?

1387
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,532
There was a snafu with it
when we stopped...

1388
01:33:09,532 --> 01:33:11,265
I called that bed and
breakfast in Napa...

1389
01:33:11,265 --> 01:33:14,002
They said they had no
record of you even checking in.

1390
01:33:15,762 --> 01:33:17,064
That's because we didn't go to Napa.

1391
01:33:17,511 --> 01:33:19,552
Stu, what the fuck is going on?

1392
01:33:20,577 --> 01:33:22,548
We went to Las Vegas./
Oh, really? Las Vegas?/ Yup.

1393
01:33:22,991 --> 01:33:24,544
Why would you go to Las Vegas?

1394
01:33:24,859 --> 01:33:27,061
Because my best friend was getting
married and that's what guys do.

1395
01:33:27,294 --> 01:33:29,109
Really? But that's now what you do!

1396
01:33:29,503 --> 01:33:33,742
Then why did I do it, huh?
Cuz I did it. Riddle me that!

1397
01:33:34,050 --> 01:33:35,633
Why did I do it?

1398
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:38,383
Sometimes I think all you want me
to do is what you want me to do.

1399
01:33:38,721 --> 01:33:40,447
I'm sick of doing what you
want me to do all the time.

1400
01:33:40,447 --> 01:33:42,424
I think in a healthy
relationship sometimes a guy...

1401
01:33:42,424 --> 01:33:43,670
Should be able to do
what he wants to do.

1402
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:45,967
That is now how this works!

1403
01:33:45,967 --> 01:33:49,618
Oh, good! Because whatever
this is, ain't workin' for me.

1404
01:33:50,249 --> 01:33:51,163
Oh, really?/
Yeah.

1405
01:33:51,587 --> 01:33:52,532
Since when?

1406
01:33:52,745 --> 01:33:56,392
Since you fucked that waiter
on your cruise last June.

1407
01:33:56,477 --> 01:33:57,372
Boom!

1408
01:34:00,317 --> 01:34:01,974
You told me it was a bartender.

1409
01:34:01,974 --> 01:34:05,296
Oh, you were right. I stand
corrected. It was a bartender.

1410
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:06,960
You fucked a bartender.

1411
01:34:07,385 --> 01:34:08,280
You're an idiot.

1412
01:34:08,994 --> 01:34:10,257
You're a...
You...

1413
01:34:11,195 --> 01:34:13,417
You're such a bad person.

1414
01:34:13,693 --> 01:34:15,946
Like, all the way through to your core.

1415
01:34:18,210 --> 01:34:20,452
Alan, shall we dance?

1416
01:34:22,193 --> 01:34:23,150
Let's do this.

1417
01:34:23,993 --> 01:34:27,127
Hey! I'm gonna leave forever.

1418
01:34:28,107 --> 01:34:30,845
I'm gonna learn how to fly high.

1419
01:34:32,224 --> 01:34:33,240
It was a real pleasure meeting you.

1420
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:34,180
Fuck off.

1421
01:34:35,386 --> 01:34:36,990
I'm thinking about getting
my bartender's license.

1422
01:34:37,231 --> 01:34:38,295
Suck my dick.

1423
01:34:39,158 --> 01:34:39,754
No, thank you.

1424
01:34:42,876 --> 01:34:48,100
Remember, remember, remember,
Remember my name, babe!

1425
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:01,633
Dougie, I gotta tell you, man.
That was a gorgeous wedding.

1426
01:35:02,025 --> 01:35:03,054
I'll give it 6 months.

1427
01:35:03,846 --> 01:35:04,509
You're a dick.

1428
01:35:05,889 --> 01:35:10,041
I don't know what to say. Thanks,
for the bachelor party, I guess?

1429
01:35:11,035 --> 01:35:14,522
Yeah. I just wish we could
actually remember some of it.

1430
01:35:15,234 --> 01:35:17,104
Hey, guys. Look what I found.

1431
01:35:17,104 --> 01:35:18,923
Whoa, that's my camera.

1432
01:35:18,923 --> 01:35:20,591
Yeah, it was lodged in
the back seat of the car.

1433
01:35:21,048 --> 01:35:22,232
Are there photos on it?

1434
01:35:22,496 --> 01:35:24,734
Yeah. Some of it is even
worse than we thought.

1435
01:35:24,816 --> 01:35:25,935
No fuckin' way. Give me that.

1436
01:35:27,137 --> 01:35:28,829
Wait.

1437
01:35:32,135 --> 01:35:35,553
We look at these pictures
together, okay? One time.

1438
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:39,197
And then we delete the evidences.

1439
01:35:39,745 --> 01:35:41,146
I say we delete it right now.

1440
01:35:41,552 --> 01:35:42,383
Are you nuts?

1441
01:35:42,668 --> 01:35:45,025
I wanna find out how I wind up
in the hospital. Is that in there?

1442
01:35:45,217 --> 01:35:46,088
Yeah, it's in there.

1443
01:35:46,456 --> 01:35:49,149
Guys, one time.

1444
01:35:49,312 --> 01:35:50,385
Deal?/ Deal.

1445
01:35:56,423 --> 01:35:58,362
Oh, dear Lord!
