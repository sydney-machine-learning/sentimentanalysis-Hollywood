FLEMNER AIR FORCE BASE
20 years ago

3
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,960
Look out!

4
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,640
He singed my tail feathers.

5
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,880
All right, Buzz. That's enough of that.

6
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,440
What did I just say?

7
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:51,040
That is a good way to lose an eye, my friend.

8
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,920
Hold it. We've got company at two o'clock.

9
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,600
I got him, Mailman. Hang on.

10
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,920
Here we go.

11
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,640
- Buzz, what is goin' on up there?
- Just movin' a road hog.

12
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,160
- Knock it off! What kind of stunt was that?
- Just seein' what this baby can do.

13
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,040
This bag of bones isn't rated past Mach two.

14
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,920
- Mach one.
- The G-forces, Buzz! The G-forces!

15
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,080
Mach two. Gotta push the envelope.

16
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
Mach three!

17
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,160
Buzz! We're tearing apart!

18
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,440
I'm losin' control.
Eject, Mailman. Hit the silk!

19
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,560
- I can't get out!
- What are you doing?

20
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Buzz! Get back here!

21
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,200
OK. I've been in tougher scrapes than this.

22
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,520
There's the ground. It looks hard. OK, trees.

23
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,720
No! Oh. Mahogany. Ow!

24
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,960
Squirrel's nest. Bird. Ow! Pine.

25
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,600
Ow! Oh, the ground.

26
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,000
I made it.

27
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,000
I made it! There is a God.

28
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,680
Hallelujah!

29
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,760
You're French, aren't you?

30
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,840
Yeah, just like that.

31
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
Hey, look! There's one!

32
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,600
Present Day

33
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,840
Topper Harley?

34
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Once, perhaps.

35
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,640
Now I am called Tukachinchilla.

36
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,920
- What does it mean?
- Fluffy Bunny Feet.

37
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,120
It's very nice.

38
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,240
I'm Lieutenant Commander James Block.

39
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,720
I knew your father Buzz.

40
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,600
Until his incident, he was
the greatest pilot who ever lived.

41
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,040
We need to talk.

42
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,160
The Navy wants...

43
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,600
The Navy wants you back, Harley.

44
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,640
They threw me out. Why should I go back?

45
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,800
I came here to get away from the Navy.
Away from flying.

46
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,040
The Navy has a top-secret mission:
Sleepy Weasel.

47
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,280
I'm giving you a second chance,
which your father never had.

48
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,160
You're the best of the best, Topper.

49
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,920
Leave me to speak with the old one.
He is wise in the ways of such things.

50
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The Navy really needs you.

51
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
Great helium.

52
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
Owatonna.

53
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,440
Owatonna!

54
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,080
What is it, Fluffy?

55
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,720
They want me to fly in a great battle.
What should I do?

56
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,000
We knew this day would come.

57
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,880
Dances With Bikers got this for you.

58
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,080
Cool.

59
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,280
While you're out,
pick up some AA batteries.

60
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,440
Wow!

61
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Ten... hut!

62
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,720
Admiral. Good to see you again, sir.

63
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,360
- It's been too long.
- And so it has. Yes, yes.

64
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,400
- How are ya, sir?
- Hawaii?

65
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,640
- Goddamn it, Bill, I should be in California.
- No, sir, this is California.

66
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,560
- Well, gotta run. Good luck.
- But, sir, this is your command.

67
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,160
Sleepy Weasel has been planned for
ten months. The president hand-picked you.

68
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,760
Damn right he did.
No stoppin' us now, huh, Ted?

69
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,240
- I'll show you your offices and brief you.
- You're a fine soldier, Scott. Lead the way.

70
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Oh, good God. I gotta pee.

71
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,240
I had part of my bladder
blown off at Guadalcanal.

72
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,720
Watch your step.
There's a lot of obstructions here.

73
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,160
- I had a little dreidel!
- I made it out of clay!

74
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,760
- And when it's dry and ready...
- My dreidel I will play!

75
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,640
- Here's the story...
- Of a lovely lady!

76
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,840
- Who was bringing up...
- Three very lovely girls!

77
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,680
- All of them had hair of gold!
- Like their mother!

78
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,160
- The youngest one...
- In curls!

79
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,360
- Here's the story...
- Of a man named Brady!

80
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
Gentlemen, he's back.

81
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
How ya been?

82
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,240
- Yeah, it's the big guy.
- Good to see ya.

83
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,120
- Scooter! How you doin'?
- Topper. The main man.

84
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,360
- Rabbi! Mazel tov.
- You should live and be well!

85
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,120
Hey, buddy.

86
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,000
Are you OK?

87
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,320
You don't look so hot. You need some help?

88
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,400
I'm OK.

89
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
You're Topper Harley, aren't you?

90
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,640
I hear you've got chops we only dream of.
Throwin' you out was a bum rap.

91
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,800
I'm Jim Pfaffenbach.
Everybody calls me Wash Out.

92
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,760
- You're a pilot?
- Oh, yeah. I'm gonna be flyin' with ya.

93
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,800
Good.

94
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,280
Cute.

95
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,720
I like to stay in shape. Thanks.

96
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,280
- Are these all at home?
- Yeah.

97
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,760
The dogs, wife and kids.

98
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,960
You got pictures of your family,
I'd love to see 'em.

99
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,240
- I am my family photo.
- But everybody needs a family to love.

100
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,640
I could never find time for love. It's
too heavy. It's an anchor that drowns a man.

101
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,280
Besides, I got the sky,
the smell of jet exhaust, my bike.

102
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,640
- A loner?
- No. I own it.

103
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,480
I can see I'm gonna have to work on you.

104
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,960
Name's Pete Thompson. But...

105
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,320
everybody calls me Dead Meat.

106
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,000
- Topper Harley.
- Just a pleasure.

107
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,520
Attention on deck!

108
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,600
Good morning, sir!

109
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,480
I don't care
how many missions you've flown!

110
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,440
I don't care how good you think you are!
You're nobody!

111
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,640
And for the next ten days,
nobody takes a crap unless I say so!

112
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,720
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

113
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
I said "Attention".

114
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,760
Now, didn't I make myself clear?
Or don't you take orders?

115
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,040
- When I say "Attention", I mean "Attention"!
- Yes, sir!

116
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,720
Now!

117
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,000
- You eyeballin' me, mister?
- No, sir!

118
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,880
The next time I see that ugly face of yours,
I want it clean-shaven! Suck in that chest!

119
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,960
Pfaffenbach!

120
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,920
- What you lookin' at, boy?
- Nothin', sir!

121
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
Oh, I'm some lowlife that's
not good enough for you to talk to?

122
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,760
Well, that attitude is short on collateral!
I'm God as far as you're concerned!

123
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,320
Hey, hey. Lighten up.

124
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,120
Cut the kid some slack.

125
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,840
Who the hell are you talkin' to, son?

126
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,520
Your ego's writin' cheques
your body can't cash.

127
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,120
Now you got five minutes to stow your gear.

128
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,000
Get movin'!

129
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,960
Yeah, I'm sure deep down he means well.

130
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
I hope you were paying attention.

131
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,400
- I don't think we've met.
- Kent Gregory.

132
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,080
Excuse me if I don't shake your hand.

133
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,360
Your father killed someone very special
to me: Dominic "Mailman" Farnham.

134
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,160
- You mean...
- Yes.

135
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,280
Dominic Farnham was my father.
I was his love child.

136
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,400
- It was a hunting accident.
- Accident, my deep-blue eyes.

137
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,920
It was reckless, irresponsible flying,
and you know it.

138
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,200
Are you OK?

139
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,480
This is an incredible coincidence,

140
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,000
but the hunter who mistakenly
killed your father...

141
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,840
was Henry Pfaffenbach, my father.

142
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,960
I feel terrible.

143
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,720
Isn't this Henry Alva Pfaffenbach?

144
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
My mother was a Pfaffenbach.

145
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,680
Not... Doreen Pfaffenbach?

146
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,880
- From Minnesota?
- Yeah.

147
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,560
Then we're cousins. We used to
spend our summers in Eagle River.

148
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,640
Eagle River?

149
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,920
I hope you can forgive me for this.

150
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,840
If it helps, I didn't have seconds.

151
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,040
That's all right. It's not your fault.
Anyone could have made that mistake.

152
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,200
But him, he's the type that could
end up killing every man in this outfit.

153
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:57,320
Wait a minute. Why are you mad at me?
He's the one who ate your father.

154
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,560
Like father, like son.
You've already been tossed out once.

155
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,640
Hold it, hold it.

156
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,400
We can't fight among ourselves.
We're all on the same team here.

157
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,080
I want the two of you to shake hands.

158
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,880
There, now. Isn't that better?

159
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,040
- Yeah.
- Sure.

160
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:25,160
There. We're friends again.

161
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,520
Here. Have some of my lucky gum.

162
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,680
Look, Dead Meat. We fly together,
we sleep next to each other, but that's all.

163
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,800
Don't get too close.
Let me handle my own affairs.

164
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
He's so complex.

165
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,600
Every aerial photo and recon report
indicate a defensive arsenal

166
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,680
in the D, and perhaps -C, categories.

167
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,080
There's also some anti-aircraft squadrons.

168
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,280
They can send up an ack-ack umbrella
high enough to make any attack ineffective.

169
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,320
I don't have a clue
what you're talkin' about, Phil.

170
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,200
I have a shell the size of a fist in my head.
Pork Chop Hill.

171
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,440
The only way I can make this toup stay on

172
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,800
is by magnetising the upper left
quadrant of my skull.

173
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,840
You just go ahead and do what you do.
Do you have any soup?

174
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:15,400
Of course, sir. I'll have the mess
bring something right up.

175
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,960
I love soup. I mean, I think I love soup.

176
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,840
Son-of-a-bitchin' shell. It's either
soup or duck. Which one do you shoot?

177
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
Duck, sir.

178
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,520
- Are you all right, sir?
- Of course I'm all right.

179
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,240
Why? What have you heard?

180
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,120
Nothing, sir.

181
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,840
Send some soup up for the admiral,
on the double.

182
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,600
Let's go over this Slippery Weevil
one more time.

183
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:43,120
I wanna familiarise myself with it as much
as I possibly can. So, give it to me, Ben.

184
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Every word. Every detail.

185
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,520
Dot every comma.

186
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Those are some long legs.

187
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,920
I just had them lengthened.
Now they go all the way up.

188
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,480
Wow.

189
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,160
It's nice to see you again. I was really
impressed, the way you handled that stallion.

190
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,760
When I saw you dig your heels into his sides,
tighten the reins and break his spirit,

191
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,640
I never wanted to be a horse
so much in my life.

192
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,520
After I finish off this shrink,
we can take a quick canter in the meadow.

193
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,040
Lieutenant, I am the shrink.

194
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,880
- You're the psychiatrist?
- That's what the diploma says.

195
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,280
I've never been to a psychiatrist before.
You will be gentle?

196
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,800
I've been ordered to review your records.

197
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:11,600
You were discharged from the service
18 months ago for wilfull insubordination.

198
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:16,320
You disobeyed a direct order
and lost a $13m fighter in the process.

199
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,840
Yes, I did. But I'm payin' it off
at ten bucks a week.

200
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,200
I should have gotten
that extra collision coverage.

201
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,680
Wasn't your father involved
in a similar incident?

202
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,280
- What do you mean?
- Leland "Buzz" Harley.

203
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,280
Three Purple Hearts,
presidential commendation.

204
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,080
Then this incident -
the Dominic Farnham death.

205
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,960
1971, his Visa card was cancelled.

206
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:43,360
1975, a broken man, suffocated while working
the night shift in a Photomat booth.

207
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,360
Tell me how these events affected you.

208
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,920
Well, I don't think about it much.

209
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,240
That was a long time ago. Now if you'll
excuse me, I have some guns to grease.

210
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Lieutenant,

211
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,840
have you thought about
seeing a psychiatrist on a regular basis?

212
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
I thought you'd never ask.

213
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,400
I mean professionally.

214
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,560
Thanks, Doctor.

215
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,800
Thanks for the advice.

216
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,240
- Be careful out there.
- I can take care of myself.

217
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,960
- No. You're going to get hurt.
- I don't need your help, or anybody's.

218
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,720
I'll be just fine.

219
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,480
Are you OK?

220
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,720
Yeah. I'm fine.

221
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,800
Attention on deck.

222
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
At ease, men.

223
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,440
Be seated.

224
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,720
Many of you are wondering about my pants.
Well, they ran short of material at the knees.

225
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,040
So don't give me any shit.

226
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,480
Now, I look out there
at all of you guys and I say to myself:

227
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,720
What I wouldn't give
to be 20 years younger,

228
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,800
and a woman.

229
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,120
You know, I've flown over 194 missions,
and I was shot down on every one.

230
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,240
Come to think of it, I've never
landed a plane in my life. Now,

231
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,360
you men'll be piloting the backbone
of our proud American arsenal:

232
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,480
The Oscar EW 5894 Phallus
tactical fighter bomber.

233
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:31,880
Its lightweight swept wing design
makes it extremely maneuverable and agile.

234
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,840
Beneath its 21st-century skin is a highly
advanced avionics and weapons package.

235
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,040
Designed for speed and combat acrobatics,

236
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,120
it features the latest Mrs Halver
series 3800 radar-jamming Framus.

237
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,920
- Admiral.
- Nurse.

238
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,440
Sleepy Weasel's success depends on our
ability to manoeuvre below enemy radar.

239
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:57,640
I wanna see a major display of low-level
flying. Topper, Kent, you're up first.

240
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,920
- Show me what you can do.
- Copy that, Purple Fluffer Nutter.

241
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,080
Roger that, Milli Vanilli Chilly Willy.

242
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,960
Bring 'em down, boys. I want your bellies to
scrape the sagebrush. Let's see who's best.

243
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,240
I'm heading for the canyon floor.

244
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,400
- For your information, I'm at 150 feet.
- I'm at 3rd and Main.

245
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,960
Very pretty, but enough hot-dogging, Harley.

246
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,280
Just checkin' the traffic.

247
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,280
- How'd I do, big fella?
- Don't get me started, Harley.

248
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,560
Cut the chatter. Topper,
that was vintage Buzz Harley.

249
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,040
You and your dad are two of a kind.

250
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,320
Your ego's writin' cheques
your body can't cash.

251
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,800
Topper! Get back in formation.

252
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,160
Topper, you weren't clear to detach.

253
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,040
- What was that all about?
- I... thought I saw Elvis.

254
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,960
Let it go, Topper.
The King is gone. Let's head for home.

255
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Not again.

256
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,520
I need a landing clearance
for runway 30... 30 something.

257
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,960
30 thirty something's been cancelled.
Go to runway 2-niner.

258
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,640
Wash Out, what the hell
are you doin'? Pull it up.

259
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,320
Wash Out, where the hell are you?
What is your location? You're off of radar.

260
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,680
Repeat: What is your location?

261
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,600
- Goin' up?
- Yes.

262
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,920
Can I press your button?

263
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,840
No, you've been slavin' over hot psychotics
all day. Let me get that.

264
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,320
- Interesting perfume.
- It's Vicks. I have a cold.

265
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,480
Lieutenant, you're staring.

266
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,400
No, not really. I'm lost in your eyes.

267
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:38,000
That is the whitest white part of the eye
I've ever seen. Do you floss?

268
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,800
You're very confident, aren't you?

269
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,800
When you have 10,000 pounds of thrust
at your command, you have to be.

270
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,520
Lieutenant, please.
I'm talking to you as a psychiatrist.

271
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,440
I'm recommending that you be grounded.

272
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,680
- You've got to be joking.
- If I were joking, I'd have said:

273
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,680
"What do you do with an elephant
with three balls?"

274
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,360
"You walk him and pitch to the rhino."

275
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,280
- You are serious.
- It's the best thing for you, and the mission.

276
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,720
The best would be
if you'd stop tryin' to run my life.

277
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,400
I'm a pilot, and nobody's gonna
keep me out of the sky.

278
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,960
Ladies and gentlemen!
Twelve rounds of boxing

279
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:23,160
for the WBA WBC WPA RSVP

280
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,960
Heavyweight Championship of the World!

281
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,280
Introducing celebrities at ringside,

282
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,080
please welcome His Holiness,
the very popular pontiff,

283
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,120
Pope John Paul II!

284
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,080
Second!

285
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,800
Lieutenant Commander Block.
We meet at last.

286
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,880
- Isn't this place a little public?
- No, a crowd offers remarkable anonymity.

287
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,200
How are we doing at Dudley?

288
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
Oh, we're right on schedule.

289
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,360
Can't quite get a reading on Admiral Benson,
but Topper Harley's playing into our hands.

290
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,040
Here's his evaluation. A clear-cut case
of Paternal Conflict Syndrome.

291
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,760
Ah, yes. PCS.

292
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,120
I saw an After school Special on that.
They're years away from a vaccine.

293
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,760
Every time I mention Buzz's name,
Topper goes off.

294
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,840
There's no way the unit will function,
and I'll abort the mission.

295
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,080
The Navy's planes will seem inferior and
the president will beg for my super fighter.

296
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,080
And, best of all, nobody gets hurt.

297
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,320
Well done, Lieutenant Commander.

298
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,640
America can't afford to fall behind,
Mr. Wilson. We need your plane.

299
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,160
This should be a good match.
Both men work for Don King.

300
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,320
Well, fans, that's it.
Good night. I'm outta here!

301
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,160
The Strafing Run proudly presents
the music of Lawrence Lipps!

302
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
And now...

303
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,040
" What the world needs...
Thank you!

304
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,280
" Is love...
Thank you so much!

305
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,880
" That's the only thing
that there's just too darn little of

306
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,480
Ramada?

307
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,200
- Kent!
- Ramada!

308
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,800
Qu'est-ce que je suis contente de te revoir!

309
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,160
My eyes!

310
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,680
Darling, I thought you were still in Brussels.

311
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,320
Oh, Kent. We were only hurting each other.

312
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,200
I thought that's the way you wanted it.

313
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,920
Something's changed. It's not another
woman, is it? I couldn't compete with that.

314
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,640
No, of course you couldn't.

315
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:44,200
Well, what matters is that you're here.
We've a lot of catching up to do.

316
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,200
Wonderful. Just let me
take care of something.

317
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:50,000
- Don't be long, mon amour.
- Absolument.

318
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,920
Wow!

319
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,040
Anybody here from out of town?

320
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,320
Welcome. Nice to see you.

321
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,080
- Ramada...
- Oh, no.

322
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,800
Well, if it isn't God's gift to the cockpit.

323
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,960
- Kent, your nostrils are flaring.
- That flying stunt today was pure madness.

324
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,560
If a lady wasn't present,
I'd tear you apart like a Christmas goose.

325
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,040
Yeah? Keep it up, you'll be carrying
your face home in a doggy bag.

326
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,240
What is this macho thing?

327
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,320
- He started it.
- Did not.

328
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,400
- Did too.
- Did not.

329
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,120
- You're behaving like children.
- He's being a jerk.

330
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,840
- Am not.
- Are too.

331
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,520
- Am not.
- Are too too too...

332
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,280
- Not not not...
- too too too...

333
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,600
Are too times ten.

334
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,480
- That's it.
- Stop it.

335
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,360
- Rumble!
- Don't push me.

336
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,240
Stop it! Can't you act
like civilised human beings?

337
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,920
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- I love you, pal.

338
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,680
Listen. Kent and I have to talk, so please...

339
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,560
Be my guest.

340
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,440
Let's celebrate, honey.

341
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
Hey, everybody. Drinks are on me.

342
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,400
- Free beer!
- I want a gin sling!

343
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,160
You haven't forgotten my offer, have you?

344
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,360
Little house in the country,
white picket fence, Stairmaster.

345
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,040
Kent, you're everything
a woman could possibly want.

346
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,920
But I'm just not ready for marriage. Not yet.

347
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,920
Well, I have to get back to the base.
Tomorrow's an important flight.

348
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,400
You know how puffy my eyes get
when I don't get enough rest.

349
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,720
Good night.

350
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,160
May I?

351
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,480
- Shouldn't you be getting back to the base?
- I suppose,

352
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,760
if I played life by the rules,
but you know I don't.

353
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,640
All right. You can walk me to my apartment.

354
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,120
I shouldn't have gotten mad
in the elevator today.

355
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,360
But when I want something that bad,
I get all fired up.

356
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,080
Maybe that's why I worry so.
Maybe more than I should.

357
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,080
Something terrible could happen. You must...

358
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,680
- But I...
- Don't worry.

359
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,160
Everything will be fine. I promise.

360
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,880
Boy, I hope so.

361
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Well, this is it.

362
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,240
- It's a nice place.
- It's OK.

363
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,400
The only problem is I have a nosy landlady.

364
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
Well, I guess this is good night.

365
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,960
I don't wanna go back.

366
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,040
You don't have to.

367
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,240
I don't want to be alone.

368
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:39,600
And, by the way,
I can go all night like a lumberjack.

369
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,960
What about your landlady?

370
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,040
You can do her, too.

371
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,520
So, I take it you've been with a man before.

372
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,440
I'm a virgin.

373
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,520
I'm just not very good at it.

374
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,880
Yes. Oh, yes!

375
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,680
Topper!

376
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,440
Wash Out!

377
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,920
Get into your flight suit.
We're ready to go up.

378
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,360
I got kicked out. My flight status
has been withdrawn. I'm through, Dead Meat.

379
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,440
- What happened?
- It's my eyes. I've got walleye vision.

380
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,600
- Can't something be done?
- A delicate corneal inversion procedure.

381
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,600
A multi-opti-pupil-optomy.

382
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:01,400
But, to keep from damaging the eye sockets,
they've gotta go in through the rectum.

383
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,480
Ain't no man gonna take that route with me.

384
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,680
Is Topper around? I'd like to say goodbye.

385
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,800
He didn't come back last night. He's AWOL.
As soon as Block finds out, he's history.

386
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,480
But flying's his life. He's the best pilot in the
world. We need him as much as he needs us.

387
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,600
I can't find my lucky gum. Do you have...

388
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,160
Wash Out?

389
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,680
Oh, my God. I missed my flight.

390
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,960
You're amazing.

391
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
Dead Meat!

392
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,240
Mary!

393
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,520
- Come to watch me fly?
- No. There was a meltdown at the plant.

394
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,880
- They gave me afternoon off.
- Terrific!

395
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,440
Oh! Good news. We just closed escrow
on our little dream house.

396
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,920
- Wonderful! When do we move in?
- Tuesday.

397
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,840
The kids are stripping
the asbestos off the pipes now.

398
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,840
That's great! Things couldn't be better for us.

399
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,840
I'm so blessed.

400
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:16,040
Oh! Your life insurance forms
came for you to sign.

401
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,600
Oh, my mirror!

402
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,960
- I'll get another pen.
- No need. I'll sign it when I get back.

403
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,800
Well, you know best.

404
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,200
Honey, you know that global-warming
problem? I know how we can reverse it.

405
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,720
- Tell me.
- No, not now, lovey-bumpers.

406
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,040
There'll be plenty of time for that later.

407
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,760
And my investigation
into JFK's assassination?

408
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,920
You found the evidence you wanted?

409
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,520
Yes. It's right here in my pocket. It's big,
honey. It goes all the way to the White House.

410
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,960
- Do you want me to hold it for you?
- Nah. It'll be safe right here.

411
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,040
I'm in a jet. What could go wrong?

412
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:01,600
Oh, Dead Meat. We just couldn't be
any more perfectly happy.

413
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,840
Where the hell is Topper?

414
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,320
Thanks for joinin' the party!

415
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,680
Hey, Topper! You seen any of my lucky gum?

416
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
No.

417
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,240
Freedom Squadron, start your engines.

418
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,080
God, that's loud. My ear canals
are very sensitive. Stainless steel.

419
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,160
Took a bullet in Corregidor.
Passed straight through. Look at this.

420
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,600
We have these to hold down the sound, sir.

421
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:46,680
Oh, good. Thanks.

422
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,000
Let's hope they do the trick.
Give me the mike, boy.

423
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,920
For the love of God, man, be careful.

424
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,680
Ever since Normandy, this is Corning Ware.

425
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:03,120
Those of you who excel
during these aerial combat exercises

426
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:07,520
will go on to make up
the greatest fighting unit ever assembled.

427
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:13,360
- Topper, keep that nose up!
- He's never done that before.

428
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,560
Red team leader, break off.
Prepare to engage.

429
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,160
Roger that.

430
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,400
- Blue leader, prepare for action.
- Roger that.

431
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,080
I'm minus six. Movin' in.

432
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,560
I've got tone. Got him!

433
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,600
Dead Meat, confirm kill.

434
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,920
- Mrs. Thompson?
- Yes.

435
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,440
- I'm Topper Harley.
- Oh! Dead Meat's talked about you!

436
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,520
Oh, he thinks the world of you.

437
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,920
But shouldn't you be up there
flying with the squad?

438
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,960
I've got a lock. I'm closing in.

439
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,040
He's spotted me. He's a slippery devil.

440
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,800
Topper! Watch your right side! Damn!

441
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,280
I'm bailin' out!

442
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,200
Wash Out? What are you doin' here?

443
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,080
There's no time to go into it.

444
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,800
Do me a favour-don't land.

445
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,960
- Get outta here! We're gonna crash!
- I can't! I'm stuck!

446
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,520
Then I must help you, my friend!
Think well of me!

447
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,560
Thank you!

448
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,520
- Don't. Don't look.
- Oh, no!

449
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,880
Whoa!

450
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,760
Oh, man!

451
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,800
Wendy, I can fly!

452
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,840
- Hey, Topper.
- Easy, buddy.

453
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,200
- The darnedest thing just happened.
- Hang on, buddy.

454
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,560
Topper?

455
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,480
Swing him around this way.

456
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,240
Let's go. One, two.

457
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,320
Let's move it. Come on.

458
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,360
- Come on.
- Enough!

459
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,480
Hello!

460
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,840
Relax, buddy. We'll have you
in the hospital in no time.

461
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,920
Good morning! Excuse me!

462
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,440
Wait, guys! Wait!

463
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,640
Let's go, let's go.

464
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,720
Easy. Easy, easy, easy.

465
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,120
- Let's move.
- What a ride!

466
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:28,680
- Wash Out. You made it.
- Why, thank you, André.

467
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,760
I'll have the veal piccata.

468
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,720
- Oh. Get the cardio read-out.
- Where is it?

469
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,160
- It's...
- Hey, fellas.

470
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:42,280
- Inside there on the left.
- I can't find it!

471
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,960
- Doctor!
- What happened?

472
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,040
Plane crash.

473
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,800
- We gotta work fast. I got a lunch.
- You're missing the big picture, Doc.

474
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,240
Nurse, check his penis isn't longer than mine.

475
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,680
- No, Doctor.
- Good. Now this is gonna hurt.

476
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,240
Nurse, give me 15cc of morphine, quickly.

477
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,200
- Can you save him?
- Can't be sure. I'm not a good doctor.

478
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,000
Thank you, Nurse. Wait here.

479
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,480
- You gonna be all right, buddy?
- I'm in a hospital. What could go wrong?

480
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,480
Mrs. Thompson, I know you must hate me
but there's something I want you to have.

481
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:27,600
I've been puttin' a little away
for the past ten years.

482
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,400
It's not much. 2500. I wish I could do more.

483
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,320
Why, Topper.

484
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,400
That's so sweet.

485
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,840
Why, with the three million
I won on this Lucky Lotto ticket,

486
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,400
I can take this 2500
and just blow it all on hats.

487
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,120
Right, and halt!

488
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,120
Pete "Dead Meat" Thompson is dead.

489
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,120
So is Mo Green,

490
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,040
Tataglia, Barzini,

491
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:13,400
the heads of all the five families.

492
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:18,520
It is at moments like these,
my dear friends, that we must ask ourselves:

493
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:21,600
"How can this not be part
of some larger plan?"

494
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,040
Do good men like Dead Meat Thompson
just blink out one day like a bad bulb?

495
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,440
One minute you're in bed
with a knockout gal, or guy,

496
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:32,040
and the next, you're a compost heap.

497
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,800
Doesn't that bother you?
Because it scares the living piss outta me!

498
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:42,000
I never thought this could happen.
Don't we have what we need now, Mr. Wilson?

499
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,520
This should be enough to prove
that our planes need replacing.

500
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:50,920
No. They have to fail in combat for the world
to take notice. This is a minor incident.

501
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,840
Minor? I just lost one of my best men.

502
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,640
Are you backing out on us, Block?

503
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,720
I'm doing this for my country,

504
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,800
not for you.

505
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,080
We'll need the backup plan.

506
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,120
Ready? Fire!

507
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,360
Jumpin' Jesus, they're back!

508
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,000
Take cover! Hit the deck!

509
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,200
Cover me!

510
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,000
Battle stations! Battle stations!

511
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,720
Have they no respect for the dead?

512
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,680
God, I love a good funeral.

513
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,640
Topper, where are you going?

514
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:03,160
I'm handin' in my resignation. You were right.
You said I was dangerous, and I am.

515
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,400
Topper, wait.

516
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,480
Please, let's talk.

517
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,960
They're right. I'm no better than my father.

518
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,880
It seems, no matter what I do,
I end up hurting someone.

519
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:27,040
You've got to stop comparing yourself
with your father. You're two different people.

520
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,240
- We both killed a man.
- That's just a coincidence.

521
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,320
He loved jets. So do I.

522
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,400
He was a loner, just like me.

523
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,400
For God's sakes,
I've even got my father's eyes.

524
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,080
- Topper, please.
- Ah, they're just for luck.

525
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,560
You've got to make your own luck.

526
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:46,360
Get back in the sky and prove yourself.

527
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,480
Besides, there's something else.

528
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:55,080
After our first meeting in my office,
I sent my evaluation to Commander Block.

529
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,960
I recommended you be grounded.
I was afraid someone might get hurt.

530
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,520
What are you saying?

531
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,600
I think someone wants Sleepy Weasel to fail.

532
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:08,040
- That's heavy.
- Totally.

533
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,680
That's the other reason why you need to fly.

534
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,200
This could be your only opportunity
to save the mission

535
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,040
and solve your personal problems,
all in one fell swoop.

536
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,320
Now read it back to me, Francine.

537
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,000
"And if you ever put your goddamn hands
on my wife again, I will..."

538
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,400
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Oh, Blank. Come in.

539
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,280
I've been expecting someone.

540
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,760
- That'll be all, Francine.
- Yes, sir.

541
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,600
- Pudding?
- No, thank you, sir.

542
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,240
I'll put this to you straight.
Thompson's death shocked us all.

543
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:02,320
And that hot shot Harley is responsible.
I want that smirking little wise-ass outta here.

544
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,360
Morale on this base is shot to hell.
Just look out there.

545
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,720
Quiet. Now, hardly a man moving.

546
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,320
Roy? Roy!

547
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,200
Huh? I even went to school with that man.
It's just not the same.

548
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,960
Been ignoring me all day.
Remind me to send him a note.

549
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:25,320
Sir, may I say something?

550
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,680
I know Harley acted irresponsibly.

551
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,360
But his kind lives on the edge.
Always willing to take a chance.

552
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,400
Now, we need Topper for this mission
for just that reason.

553
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,240
I like your thinking, Colonel.

554
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,920
Besides, Thompson wasn't that good a pilot.

555
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,640
He only had a small family. The kids are
a pain in the ass. The wife's on the sauce.

556
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,120
Poor bastard's better off dead.

557
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,840
What size shoes do you wear?

558
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,920
- A nine, sir.
- Good.

559
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,560
It's settled. We'll send Harley to the front.

560
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,480
By the way. Thank you for having us
over to dinner the other night.

561
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,840
Cheryl and I loved the Strogonoff.

562
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,880
- Sir, we didn't have dinner the other night.
- Really?

563
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,320
Well, where the hell was I?
And who's this Cheryl?

564
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,040
Doesn't matter. Run along, Sid.

565
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,000
Cheryl?

566
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,480
Kent?

567
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:34,440
I came to get my chafing dish. Our orders
just came. We're shipping out in one hour.

568
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:36,520
Are you comin' along this time?

569
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,640
- The chafing dish is not yours.
- It is.

570
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,720
- It isn't.
- OK, I don't want it.

571
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,760
- I'll take it.
- You stay out of it.

572
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,680
This is not the time or place.

573
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,800
I've got a big score
to settle with you, my friend.

574
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:50,680
Excuse me.

575
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,720
I've hurt him.

576
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,440
Topper.

577
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,440
Topper, you better go. I have to think.

578
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,800
Well, I don't.

579
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,560
- I've fallen for you like a blind roofer.
- I'm sorry?

580
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,240
My heart is fallin' down around my ankles
like a wet pair of pants.

581
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,600
My whole life, all I've wanted to do is fly.

582
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,760
Bomb stuff. Shoot people down.

583
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:23,720
But we've been through so much together.
Ramada, I need you.

584
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,800
I want you.

585
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:46,320
Wow!

586
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,920
Ramada!

587
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,120
Topper!

588
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,400
Ramada!

589
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,880
I love you!

590
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,160
I love you.

591
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,920
It's not that easy, Ramada.

592
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,360
This is one night you're not turning me out.

593
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,280
Topper, I'm so confused. I need time alone.

594
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,240
Somewhere in the Mediterranean

595
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:01,880
Admiral Benson!

596
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,280
Really? That's my name, too.

597
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:11,320
Yankee Doodle Floppy Disk, this is Foxtrot
Zulu Milkshake. Request permission to land.

598
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,240
Roger that. You are cleared to land.
Welcome to the Mediterranean.

599
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,640
Wash Out, is that you?

600
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:21,680
You bet! They put me in charge of radar.
I'm your eyes on the ground.

601
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,360
All crews report to the flight deck.
All crews report to the flight deck.

602
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,480
Have you no decency?

603
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,200
The open sea.

604
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:25,800
Oh, God. I wish I could smell.
I had my nostrils fried in Panmunjom.

605
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,160
Admiral Benson!

606
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:33,160
Meet Mr. Wilson and Mr. Rosener of Rockman
Aviation. They'll be observing the operation.

607
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,760
Yes, of course.

608
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,840
It's OK. I'm all right. No problem.

609
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:42,200
I slipped on the crab.
Who put that crab there?

610
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,280
- Crab? I didn't see any crab.
- There were two crabs. They work in pairs.

611
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,600
I went to Annapolis, for Christ's sake.

612
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:53,320
- From the Pentagon, sir. We just decoded it.
- Help me with this. My eyes are ceramic.

613
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:57,880
A bazooka round at Little Bighorn. Or was it
Okinawa? The one without the Indians.

614
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,680
It's final orders. We strike tomorrow at 0600.

615
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:04,360
Excellent. Wake me up at 0530.

616
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:39,800
- Get outta your flight suit. You're not going.
- What do you mean?

617
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,720
This mission is too important
to let you screw it up. You're not flying.

618
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,200
- Am too.
- Are not.

619
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:46,880
Am too.

620
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,120
- All right, mister. Let's go at it.
- Let's do it.

621
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,600
Come on, come on.

622
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,360
- My face!
- My hand!

623
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,280
Attention on deck!

624
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,040
Be seated.

625
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:23,040
Gentlemen, we've waited
a long time to hear this.

626
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:26,880
In exactly five hours and 17 minutes,
we hit the enemy toast.

627
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,840
- I think that's the enemy coast, sir.
- Huh? Coast?

628
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,680
That'll take a little more planning.

629
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,280
We have to knock out the nuclear-weapons
plant at Falafel Heights.

630
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:41,840
The plant goes on line in 12 hours
and is heavily defended.

631
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:47,320
If you have trouble hitting your objective,
your secondary targets are here and here:

632
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,000
An accordion factory and a mime school.

633
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,560
Good luck, gentlemen. Blink, take over.

634
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:57,440
Oh, one more thing.

635
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,920
I'll get that. It's probably for me.

636
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,000
Our sortie will proceed as planned.

637
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:11,720
And I want Topper Harley
leading our squadron into battle.

638
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,280
Lieutenant Commander, sir.

639
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:18,720
It's nothing personal.
I know I speak for every man here.

640
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,800
We've lost all respect for Harley.

641
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,280
He's poison for the morale of the unit,
and a disaster to the success of this mission.

642
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,800
You're outta line, Gregory.
You'll obey orders and like it.

643
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,680
Now get to your planes.

644
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,880
- Sir?
- What is it, Mr. Harley?

645
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:49,600
- I hope I'm wrong about this.
- What would that be?

646
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,680
Nobody likes playing
for a coach who throws the big game.

647
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,840
What's that supposed to mean?

648
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,920
My uncle told me that not playin' to win
is like sleepin' with your sister.

649
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,080
Sure, she's a great piece of tail
with a blouse full of goodies, but it's illegal.

650
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:07,840
- Jesus, Topper. Come on.
- Then you get into that whole inbred thing.

651
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,040
Kids with no teeth who play the banjo,

652
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:13,120
eat apple sauce through a straw,
pork farm animals.

653
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,640
Topper, that's enough.

654
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,720
I think you get my point, sir.

655
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,560
I just hope you're playin' straight with us.

656
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,880
Alpha Velveeta Knuckle Underwear,
you are cleared for takeoff.

657
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,440
When you hit that nuclear-weapons plant,
drop a bomb for me.

658
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,480
Sphincter Mucous Niner Ringworm, roger.

659
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:04,640
Holy cow! My cap blew off.
Swing her round. We'll pick it up.

660
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:06,720
But, sir, we're on the mission.

661
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,440
Good thinking.
We'll pick it up on the way back.

662
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,760
We gotta mark the spot, though.
Put Rabinowitz in a life raft.

663
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:18,880
- Have him row in circles until we return.
- It could be days.

664
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,400
Then put some food in the life raft, man.
Do I have to think of everything?

665
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,760
We'll tape his favourite shows.

666
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:28,800
- Sir, there's no time.
- OK, OK!

667
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:30,960
How can I be an admiral without my cap?

668
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,720
It's out there all alone
and I'm powerless to do anything about it.

669
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,200
We're entering enemy airspace.

670
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Sir, it appears we have
unidentified radar contacts.

671
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:49,880
- Looks like enemy aircraft at 12 o'clock.
- Really? That gives us about... 25 minutes.

672
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,960
Think I'll step out for a burger.

673
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:02,640
Sir, there are six of them!
Bearing 2-1-5, range 150 mi...

674
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,320
Oh my God-a dozen more of them.

675
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:13,000
And a blimp! A big, shiny blimp,
and it's slowly moving south!

676
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:17,760
- Block, have you got a tally on the bandits?
- Roger that. I got 'em.

677
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:21,600
All right. Resume combat spread.
Attack formation Delta-niner.

678
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,000
Topper in the lead.
Just like your old man, son.

679
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:29,200
Old Buzz Harley'd be proud of you, Topper.

680
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:34,960
He's the type that could end up
killing everyman in this outfit.

681
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,200
Read... my... lips.

682
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:40,080
No... new... taxes.

683
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:46,120
- Topper, what are you doing?
- He's frozen! Topper's no good to us!

684
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,840
Abort the mission! Abort the mission!

685
01:02:48,920 --> 01:02:50,920
Return to mother!

686
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,880
We can't! They're all over us!

687
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:11,000
- Damn it! All right, engage!
- I've got a bogie at 12 o'clock!

688
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,160
I got two on my tail! Kowalski, get 'em off me!

689
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:22,960
Locked up! Fox two!

690
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:31,320
- My missile didn't track!
- My engine's cut out. I'm losing power!

691
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:35,840
My cannons won't fire! What's going on?

692
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,800
I've got two bandits on my six!

693
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:46,920
This is insane. Wilson and Rosener.

694
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:51,000
It was them, wasn't it?
They said nobody was gonna get hurt.

695
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:53,400
Block, call your men back.

696
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:57,480
Like hell I will! I got
the best pilot in the world up here.

697
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,840
Topper! Topper, do you read me?

698
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,160
I was there 20 years ago. I was there
with your father and Mailman Farnham.

699
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:08,440
I was an eyewitness.
You gotta listen to me, Topper.

700
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,720
What they said about your dad is wrong.

701
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,880
Eject, Mailman. Eject!

702
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,880
I can't! My seat's jammed!

703
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:17,960
- Nothing works!
- Stay calm!

704
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,080
- My harness is malfunctioning!
- I'll get it!

705
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:25,240
Buzz! The nose! The nose!

706
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:28,760
Whoa! Sit tight!

707
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,760
Come on! Hurry!

708
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Get the lead out!

709
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,160
It's gonna be OK!

710
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,480
Wow! That was sure close!

711
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,400
Buzz! Get back here!

712
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:59,040
I'm OK!

713
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:04,320
Buzz! The wing! The wing!

714
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,400
Hurry!

715
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,560
What, are you on a break?

716
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:14,240
- Hurry!
- I'm here!

717
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,800
Hey, whose gum is this?

718
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:20,280
Oh, for God's sake! Not now!

719
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,640
Got it! Hold on! We'll bring this baby down!

720
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:29,440
Stop squirming!

721
01:05:30,120 --> 01:05:32,120
Hang on!

722
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,640
Those are my socks!

723
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,720
Buzz! Get back here!

724
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:42,160
Your father did everything humanly possible
to save Mailman's life.

725
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,760
You should be proud, son.
Buzz Harley is a true American hero.

726
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,120
- I'm hit! I'm hit!
- Block, are you all right?

727
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,880
Yes! Yes!

728
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,840
Give 'em hell!

729
01:05:57,360 --> 01:05:59,920
Got it! This is for you, Dad.

730
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,880
- They're on my tail.
- I'm with you, buddy.

731
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,280
Hang in there.

732
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,760
My guns are jammed.

733
01:06:14,120 --> 01:06:15,520
They got tone on me!

734
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,480
I'm gonna have to do it the hard way.

735
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:23,160
Anybody home?

736
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,880
They fell for that one.

737
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:30,000
- Topper! Three bandits, 12 o'clock!
- I'm on 'em!

738
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,520
Here we go, loop de loop.

739
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:36,880
Couscous!

740
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,760
Learned this one from Paula Abdul.

741
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,200
Oldest trick in the book.

742
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,600
Catch me if you can, guys.
Here's an old Buzz Harley move.

743
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:06,480
Oh, boys...

744
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,680
I'm on their tails. I've got 'em now.

745
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:18,240
Hey, buddy.

746
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,960
It looks like they're buggin' out.

747
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,960
Yikes!

748
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,560
Saved by the clouds. Come on in, boys.

749
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,480
A little hide-and-seek.

750
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,440
See ya later, guys.

751
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,000
This could be the end
of a beautiful friendship.

752
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,080
Topper, look out!

753
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,920
I got two heat-seeking missiles on my tail.

754
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,240
Block, Kent, Kowalski, get the hell outta here!

755
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:13,360
Get back to the ship!
I got me a nuclear-weapons plant to wax.

756
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,960
- You're committing suicide!
- Do as he says!

757
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,160
We are getting close.

758
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:25,160
Missiles? Still with me. Come on.

759
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:32,880
If I can't lose 'em, I'll use 'em.

760
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,440
The mother of all targets.

761
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,760
Sayonara, Saddam.

762
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,160
Come in! Are you all right?
Topper, acknowledge!

763
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:52,760
- Topper, do you read?
- Topper, are you all right?

764
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,680
There they are!

765
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:11,880
We're landing. Do you wanna
get out of the way?

766
01:09:14,280 --> 01:09:16,680
Run for your lives!

767
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,680
- Where's Topper?
- Lost contact.

768
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:39,640
- There he is!
- Pyrex Pickle Blowfish.

769
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,720
Permission to land.

770
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,440
- Youll have to talk me down. I've got damage.
- Hold it, hold it!

771
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,520
OK, Topper. Ease her in.

772
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,760
- Landing gear's frozen.
- Lookin' good.

773
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:54,960
- Lost my radar.
- A little more power now.

774
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,280
- I'm out of fuel.
- Right for lineup.

775
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,720
- Lost a wing.
- Doin' fine.

776
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,280
- There goes the other one.
- OK, Topper. Call the ball.

777
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:04,760
Touchin' down.

778
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,800
Well done, Jim!

779
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,640
- You're quite a guy.
- So are you.

780
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,280
Hey! Wash Out!

781
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,720
Oh, Topper.

782
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:38,440
You.

783
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,080
You.

784
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:48,200
- I got one question for you.
- Shoot.

785
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,280
What is a chafing dish for?

786
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:54,360
Why, it's a traditional serving piece
used at brunches to keep food warm.

787
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:57,960
- I thought that was a Crock-pot.
- No, no, no.

788
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,720
That's for cooking all day. A chafing dish...

789
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:11,240
Hey, Topper! Now that you've
made the world safe for democracy,

790
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:14,120
what will you do to cash in
on your new-found fame?

791
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:16,200
I'm goin' to Disneyland!

792
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:26,000
You're very fortunate, Commander Block.
This man has your blood type.

793
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,960
Don't worry, sir. After this transfusion,
you're gonna be just fine.

794
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,600
I've only seen heroism like that
one other time.

795
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:37,040
Maybe you know the pilot:
Leland "Buzz" Harley.

796
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,880
I've been carrying this secret around
for 20 years.

797
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:43,960
I never spoke up.

798
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,680
I wanted him to fail.

799
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:49,640
I wanted to be number one.

800
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:52,160
And I was in love with your mother.

801
01:11:52,240 --> 01:11:56,720
It's not important now, sir. Please,
save your strength for your court martial.

802
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:59,200
Topper, you had me pegged right.

803
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:01,960
I was throwin' the big game.

804
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:07,800
I really thought
we needed that other airplane.

805
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:11,840
But now I realise that
American planes will always be superior

806
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,120
as long as there are
wonderful men like you in the cockpit

807
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,200
and German parts.

808
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:21,920
I know you think it was me, but it was
Wilson and Rosener who sabotaged the jets.

809
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:24,960
They played me like a two-bit piccolo.

810
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:41,680
I can see my house from here!

811
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:47,120
Oh no, you don't.

812
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,920
- Admiral!
- You call yourself an American?

813
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,440
That gets my panties in a bunch.
It's scum like you that taint our military.

814
01:12:55,520 --> 01:13:00,080
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- You risked the lives of some fine pilots.

815
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,240
Well, that's my job.

816
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:11,920
Is it safe?

817
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,640
I think I'm wearing your pants.

818
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,440
- Ramada!
- Kent!

819
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,640
- You're OK.
- Ramada.

820
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:24,080
You must put me out of your mind.

821
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:28,960
There's a certain flyboy aboard that ship
that needs you far more than I.

822
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,880
- You must forget me.
- No problem. I will.

823
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,960
Please, not a tear.

824
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:38,080
Don't look back. That's my brave girl.

825
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,800
Don't worry, little one!
As long as I have me, I'll survive!

826
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,040
Topper!

827
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:18,120
Go, Bill, go!

828
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,760
Topper!

829
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:22,760
Wait!

830
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,360
Whoa!

831
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,760
Topper!

832
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,320
Owatonna.

833
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:49,640
I got your batteries.

834
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,680
It's about fucking time.

835
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,200
So, who won?

836
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:02,360
We did.

837
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:07,120
I fell in love with a woman,
but she threw me a curve.

838
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,960
Ramada.

839
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:23,080
Once, perhaps. Now I'm called Wawatukeena.

840
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,680
- What does it mean?
- Little Sizzling Belly.

841
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,960
" Every night I hope and pray

842
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,480
" A dream lover will come my way

843
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,960
" A girl to hold in my arms

844
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,560

852
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:20,480
" With a love, oh, so true?

853
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,120
" And a hand that I can hold
