1
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:18,603
The honorable Allen D.
and the former Mrs. Eastern.

2
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:21,679
The honorable
William and Mrs. Breslow.

3
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,576
The honorable Nelson
and Mrs. Winnie Mandela.

4
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:33,192
Ladies and gentlemen, the President
of the United States and Mrs. Bush.

5
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:40,294
Here's everybody on the list, Barb.
Everybody's here.

6
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,936
Hi, Peter. They let you
out of the office early today.

7
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,628
Jack, glad you could make it.

8
00:01:46,873 --> 00:01:50,468
Hi. Get rid of the beard.
I don't like that, too liberal.

9
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:53,111
Hi, Frank. Trudy.

10
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:58,050
Hi, Peter. Glad you could make it.
I like your suit.

11
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,312
Everybody's here.
Commissioner.

12
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:05,958
Thank you very much. Dr. Meinheimer,
I'm glad you could make it.

13
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,627
I'm looking forward to
hearing your speech.

14
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:13,731
I'm sure it's a wonderful,
well thought-out piece of work.

15
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,029
Ah, here she is. Dear.

16
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,305
Have you met Dr. Meinheimer formally?

17
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,007
Thank you.

18
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:29,648
Great Lady down!
Repeat, Great Lady down!

19
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,012
- What happened?
- Easy, watch the table!

20
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,380
Wait.

21
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:39,783
- How are you, dear?
- I'm OK, I'm fine.

22
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,993
Good. Please be seated.

23
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,166
Welcome. I'm glad you could all come.

24
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:52,804
I'm pleased that we have so many
distinguished guests tonight.

25
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:55,440
This week we are celebrating

26
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:58,839
Law Enforcement Week
all across the country.

27
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:01,912
So I'd like to turn the proceedings over

28
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,515
to our own
Washington DC Police Commissioner,

29
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,711
Captain Annabelle Brumford.

30
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:12,380
I would like to introduce
a most distinguished American.

31
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:18,155
This week he is being honored
for his 1,000th drug dealer killed.

32
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:23,666
Please welcome Lieutenant
Frank Drebin of Police Squad.

33
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:27,806
In all honesty,
the last two I backed over with my car.

34
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,601
Luckily, they were drug dealers.

35
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,212
- Good.
- Excellent!

36
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,710
Thank you, Commissioner Brumford.

37
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,821
Now I'd like to call on my Chief of Staff,
Mr. John Sununu,

38
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:46,355
to introduce some special guests.

39
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,859
Thank you. Mr. President, tonight I'm
extremely proud to welcome

40
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,090
our guests
from the nation's energy suppliers.

41
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,325
First, representing the oil industry,

42
00:03:56,569 --> 00:04:00,972
head of the Society of Petroleum Industry
Leaders, better known as SPIL,

43
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:03,004
Mr. Terence Baggett.

44
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:08,543
From the coal industry, Chairman of
the Society for More Coal Energy,

45
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,615
or SMOKE,
Mr. Donald Fenzwick.

46
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:12,978
Thank you.

47
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:15,017
From the nuclear industry,

48
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:19,180
President of the Key Atomic
Benefits Office Of Mankind, KABOOM,

49
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,293
Mr. Arthur Dunwell.

50
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:24,963
As you know, for the past three years,

51
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,929
this administration has been trying to
formulate a National Energy Policy

52
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:32,262
that will have a lasting impact
on the way we live

53
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,939
for the next decade and beyond.

54
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,735
To make sure
that we choose the right path,

55
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:43,007
the President has appointed
as his top advisor in this area,

56
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,684
Dr. Albert S. Meinheimer.

57
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:54,219
As I'm sure you're aware,
his reputation in this field is without peer,

58
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:57,692
and Dr. Meinheimer
will present his recommendations

59
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,663
to the Annual National Press Club
Dinner this Tuesday evening.

60
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,505
Mr. President.

61
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,771
I want all of you here
to be the first to know

62
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:20,419
that I've decided to base my
administration's entire energy policy

63
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:23,180
on Dr. Meinheimer's recommendations.

64
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:28,717
This issue is too important to be left to
politicians or special interests to decide.

65
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:33,627
We need an independent and informed
source on which to base future actions,

66
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,894
and Dr. Meinheimer
is the recognized expert in this field.

67
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:42,938
Mr. President, if I may say so,

68
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:47,169
I do hope that Dr. Meinheimer
won't be influenced...

69
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:52,307
...influenced by any of the so-called
environmental groups.

70
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,318
Well, we're all aware of
Dr. Meinheimer's reputation.

71
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,287
<i>He</i> is best qualified
to explain his research methods.

72
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,659
- Dr. Meinheimer.
- Great Lady down again.

73
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,239
This happens every fucking time
when I go shopping!

74
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,383
- Jane...
- Dr. Meinheimer.

75
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:48,284
- You're back early.
- And you're here late.

76
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,553
Surely, a lovely woman like you

77
00:08:50,763 --> 00:08:54,426
can think of something better to do
on a Saturday night?

78
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:58,467
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be so blunt.

79
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,440
It's all right, Doctor. It's OK.

80
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:07,705
You're thinking about <i>him</i> again,
aren't you? What was his name?

81
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,508
- Frank?
- Yes.

82
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,913
You just can't forget about him?

83
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:15,610
- Who?
- Frank.

84
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:17,649
Oh, yes!

85
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:21,452
No, I can't. I... I try.

86
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:26,064
It's just that when you've had
that much man...

87
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,928
But then, you wouldn't understand.

88
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:37,269
Jane, you mustn't be
so hard on yourself.

89
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,639
You've done a wonderful job
here at the Institute.

90
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:44,145
You're the finest Director of
Public Relations we've ever had.

91
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:47,218
Thank you, Doctor, I try my best.

92
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,347
But I see you here
night after night past ten.

93
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:57,359
You must forget about the past.
Go out, see new people, enjoy yourself.

94
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,054
There is someone I'm seeing,
in fact just yesterday.

95
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,826
I was telling him about the speech...

96
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:06,334
- Good evening.
- Hello, Norm.

97
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:10,341
I forgot.
How was the White House dinner?

98
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:15,343
Extraordinary. The President promised
to implement my recommendations.

99
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:18,517
Wonderful! Then you're going to deliver
the speech you told me about?

100
00:10:19,685 --> 00:10:22,347
Every word of it.
I would've given it tonight,

101
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:26,082
but a guest there made such a ruckus
that they wouldn't have heard me.

102
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:30,560
Hey, Al! Ken!
Look at this.

103
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,391
I found this in the waste-basket.

104
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,935
Hey, that's a pretty nice clock!

105
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:42,106
I wonder why they threw it out.

106
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:46,937
It's probably because it's
four minutes too slow. Let me fix it.

107
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,738
There.

108
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,782
<i>My name is Sergeant Frank Drebin,</i>
<i>Detective Lieutenant, Police Squad.</i>

109
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:03,519
<i>I was getting my car washed when</i>
<i>I heard the call come over the scanner.</i>

110
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:07,756
<i>There had been a bombing and I was</i>
<i>on my way to advise the DC Police</i>

111
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,766
<i>as part of the President's</i>
<i>"Operation Scum Roundup".</i>

112
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:15,031
- Ready?
- Yeah, got it.

113
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:18,766
<i>As far as police work is concerned,</i>
<i>once in a while something comes up</i>

114
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:21,606
<i>that nothing quite prepares you for.</i>

115
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:25,716
<i>Somehow, a demented madman,</i>
<i>probably full of self-hate,</i>

116
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:30,822
<i>and possibly a couple of months</i>
<i>behind in his rent, finally snapped.</i>

117
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,191
- I'm glad you could make it.
- I got here as quickly as I could.

118
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:39,125
Congratulations, I understand
that Edna's pregnant again.

119
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:41,959
- Yes, and if I catch the guy who did it...
- Captain.

120
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:46,001
They've searched the building.
No sign of a break-in, no money missing.

121
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,639
This was one hell of an explosion.

122
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,342
We're still trying to figure out
what they used.

123
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,637
- Any other victims?
- You're standing on one right now.

124
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:57,111
- Oh, I see...
- Get him out of here.

125
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:03,085
- This one's a real mess.
- Over here, Frank found another one.

126
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:07,020
- Any witnesses, Ed?
- Well, there's one. A woman.

127
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,059
She saw a man leaving
just before the explosion.

128
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:14,062
- We should let Nordberg handle it.
- No, I'd better do it while it's still fresh.

129
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,734
Not now. She fainted dead away.

130
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,303
She took a knock on the head.
She looks pretty bad.

131
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,337
- I'll handle it.
- Sir...

132
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,978
- Miss, I'd like to ask some questions.
- Not that bad.

133
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,410
She's being questioned
by our sketch artist.

134
00:12:34,653 --> 00:12:37,918
<i>I couldn't believe it was her.</i>
<i>It was like a dream.</i>

135
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:41,855
<i>But there she was,</i>
<i>just like I remembered her.</i>

136
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,962
<i>That delicately beautiful face...</i>

137
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:50,895
<i>... and a body that could melt a</i>
<i>cheese sandwich from across the room.</i>

138
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:55,540
<i>And breasts that seem to say,</i>
<i>"Hey, look at these!"</i>

139
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,613
<i>She made you drop to your knees</i>

140
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:06,251
<i>and thank God</i>
<i>that you were a man. Yeah...</i>

141
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:11,082
<i>She reminded me of my mother,</i>
<i>all right. No doubt about it.</i>

142
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:17,091
Snap out of it. You're looking at her
like she was your mother.

143
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:30,433
- Frank.
- Jane. I didn't know you lived here.

144
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,237
I moved here two years ago.

145
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,116
- How are the children?
- We didn't have any children.

146
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,013
Yes, of course.

147
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,711
- How was your prostate operation?
- Fine. As good as new.

148
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:46,255
In fact, better than ever.

149
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,187
Look, Frank...

150
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:52,626
I know it's awkward, but you're not still
obsessed with our relationship, are you?

151
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,164
Obsessed? Who's obsessed?

152
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:58,734
Because you backed out of the wedding
two years ago? I'd forgotten.

153
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,702
Ancient history,
like the Democratic Party.

154
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,808
<i>He</i> was in tears.
In church, crying like a baby.

155
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,535
- Get a hold of yourself!
- I had to return 13 Cuisinarts.

156
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:10,271
- That's enough.
- I kept the salad shooter, though.

157
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,748
Jane, there you are. Hello, Jane.

158
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:17,616
Dr. Meinheimer.
Frank, this is Dr. Albert Meinheimer.

159
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:21,156
- Don't get up. Nice to meet you.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

160
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,124
I believe we met
at the White House dinner.

161
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:27,788
He never forgets a face.
He has a photographic memory.

162
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,061
It's a terrible thing that's happened.
I hope you find the people responsible.

163
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:36,400
I'm sorry I can't be more optimistic,
but we have a long road ahead of us.

164
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:41,103
It's like sex, a painstaking task
that seems to go on and on forever,

165
00:14:41,313 --> 00:14:44,805
and when you think that things are
going your way, nothing happens.

166
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:49,421
Jane, about this man
you saw last night... Anything can help.

167
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:52,682
I gave the sketch artist a description.

168
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,827
Eh... Ed!
That'll be all, McTigue.

169
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:06,365
We should get that other artist. The one
that never dates and lives with two guys.

170
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,197
Right. Sorenson!

171
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,342
I'd like to see the rest of the Institute,
if you don't mind?

172
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:15,069
Of course.
We should start with the research area.

173
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:18,341
That's a good idea. It's right this way.

174
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,212
What can you tell me
about the man you saw last night?

175
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,413
- He's Caucasian.
- Caucasian?

176
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:29,856
Yeah. You know, white guy.
With a moustache, about 6 foot 3.

177
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,690
An awfully big moustache.
What's this all about?

178
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:35,230
This is our research laboratory.

179
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:40,370
Experiments are temperature-controlled
by the machinery below.

180
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:45,236
Our scientists have spent years on them
and are just now making breakthroughs.

181
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,776
Today, we'll join two compounds...

182
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,817
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

183
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,386
Thank heavens the bomb
didn't damage the research area.

184
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,854
Yes, but I can't understand
who'd do such a thing.

185
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,620
Jane, I think you
ought to know something.

186
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,195
- Jane, darling!
- Quentin!

187
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:10,391
Jane, are you all right?
I was so worried about you.

188
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,072
I'm really OK, but I'm glad you're here.

189
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,668
I'm sorry! Frank, this is Quentin
Hapsburg of the Hexagon Oil Company.

190
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:23,370
- Pleased to meet you, Mr...
- Drebin. Frank Drebin.

191
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:26,779
I believe I've used
some of your restrooms.

192
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,614
I'm... sure you have.

193
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:33,588
- Are you connected with the Institute?
- Not officially.

194
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:37,284
But Jane and I have seen
quite a lot of each other lately.

195
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,760
How is my little hell-cat?

196
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:45,863
Well, that's great. I've been dating, too.
Nice girl, an author.

197
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:49,336
Wrote the book on male sexual
dysfunction. You've probably read it.

198
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,668
- I beg your pardon?
- Please...

199
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:54,311
I'm sure we can
handle the situation maturely,

200
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,981
just like the responsible adults
that we are.

201
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,982
Isn't that right, Mr. Poopy Pants?

202
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,880
- That does it!
- Frank!

203
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,920
Quentin, maybe you should excuse us.

204
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,252
Anything you wish, my darling.

205
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,719
Until tonight, then...

206
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:37,588
<i>I'm feeling blue</i>

207
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:44,553
<i>Just thinking of you</i>

208
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:48,665
<i>I get out of bed</i>

209
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:55,136
<i>Wish I was dead</i>

210
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,972
<i>And I hope you do, too</i>

211
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:09,185
<i>So I've given up</i>
<i>I've thrown in the towel</i>

212
00:18:10,189 --> 00:18:12,749
<i>I've taken all the pills</i>

213
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:18,487
<i>The law will allow</i>

214
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:21,894
<i>And so I'm feeling blue</i>

215
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:27,037
- Sir?
- Give me the strongest thing you've got.

216
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,378
- On second thoughts, a Black Russian.
- Very well, sir.

217
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:40,041
<i>I guess Im just</i>

218
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,084
<i>Screwed</i>

219
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,987
Frank. I thought I'd find you here.

220
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:52,686
Ed, sit down.
Pull up a memory or two.

221
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:55,731
You left before I could talk to you.

222
00:18:55,968 --> 00:19:01,497
Is it just my imagination
or is the whole world crazy?

223
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,107
No, it's just a small percentage
of the population, Frank.

224
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:11,715
I hope you're right. It's just that
I don't know if I fit in any more.

225
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:15,411
You're still thinking about Jane,
aren't you?

226
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:19,489
She's part of my life, Ed. Always will be.

227
00:19:19,691 --> 00:19:22,751
I think about her constantly.
But it's done.

228
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:27,557
When she said, "Get out of my life
forever," I knew it was over.

229
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,701
Sometimes I think about you and Edna,
and I envy you,

230
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:36,569
because you've had the same person
every day for over 30 years.

231
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:40,074
You wake up with her,
eat with her, sleep with her...

232
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,146
You make love to the same woman.

233
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:48,183
You spend every possible
waking moment together,

234
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:53,484
while I'm out with 20-year-olds who
just want to have fun and cheap sex.

235
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,354
Girls who can't say no,
who can't get enough.

236
00:19:56,562 --> 00:20:01,158
"More, more, more! It's your turn now
to wear the handcuffs."

237
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,672
I just want to love, Ed.

238
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:11,138
I'm sure you'll find love.

239
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,543
- I already have one.
- It's from the lady.

240
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:24,321
Go to her, Frank. Go on!

241
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,851
I'll see you in the morning.

242
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:33,221
- Excuse me.
- Pardon me.

243
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,994
Sorry.

244
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,703
This isn't easy to say.

245
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,841
I'm lonely, I'm lost.
I need someone to hold, to love.

246
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,805
Frank!

247
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:48,977
Over here.

248
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:51,379
Well...

249
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:59,384
- What are you doing here?
- I called your hotel, got no answer.

250
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,550
Then I tried the station house.
I thought maybe you'd be here.

251
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:09,200
- Good evening, Sam.
- Mr. Drebin. Jane.

252
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,528
Always nice to see nice people.

253
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:17,208
Sam, play our song.
Just one more time.

254
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,876
Of course.

255
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:26,782
<i>Ding dong, the witch is dead</i>
<i>Which old witch? The wicked witch...</i>

256
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:31,821
Sam. That's enough.
Play the other one, please.

257
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:35,016
You can't let old hurts die, can you?

258
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,661
You walk out of my life,
no explanation...

259
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:40,923
- Didn't you get the letters?
- Every one of them.

260
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,863
I didn't open them.
I tore them up and threw them in the fire.

261
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:49,096
So you didn't get the cheque for $75,000
that your uncle left you in his will?

262
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,434
Why are you here?

263
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,235
I remembered something
about the crime.

264
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,645
Outside the window, I saw
a red van parked across the street.

265
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,546
Red van?
Thank you, that'll be very helpful.

266
00:22:00,752 --> 00:22:03,220
You've said your piece,
you can go now, right?

267
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,016
That's not my only reason
for being here.

268
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:09,352
- I want us to be friends.
- Sure, friends...

269
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:13,224
I bet if I dusted you for prints,
they'd be your lover Quentin's.

270
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:14,956
You!

271
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,260
I see a certain kitten
still knows how to scratch.

272
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:29,338
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that.

273
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,879
We're no good together.
All you ever lived for was police work.

274
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,784
You were always busy
saving the "end zone" layer.

275
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,585
Ozone layer!
Frank, you never tried to understand.

276
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,921
How can you say that,

277
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,430
when I sank every penny into buying
1,000 acres of Brazilian rainforest.

278
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,636
Then I had it slashed
so we could build our dream house.

279
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,930
Frank! How could you be so insensitive?

280
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:59,234
Insensitive? You think it's easy
displacing an entire tribe?

281
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:04,143
- You try it sometime.
- I'd better go. This was a mistake.

282
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:08,616
I don't know why I came here.
I was hoping that you'd have someone.

283
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:13,017
I'm single. I love being single!

284
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:18,796
I haven't had this much sex
since I was a boy scout leader!

285
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:26,170
I mean, at the time,
I was dating a lot.

286
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:40,875
- I told you the bombing wouldn't work.
- We had no choice.

287
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,019
Look at this headline.

288
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:46,782
"President to give Meinheimer
blank cheque at Press Club Dinner."

289
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:49,119
That speech is in two days.

290
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:52,160
- Don't you think I know that?
- We all know that.

291
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,730
Gentlemen, gentlemen...

292
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,434
I know that you're all worried,
and I agree.

293
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:02,334
There's plenty to be worried about.

294
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:08,377
Like this solar power plant, already
operational outside Los Angeles.

295
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,673
Photovoltaic cells.

296
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:14,785
They convert sunlight
directly into electricity.

297
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:18,820
Fluorescents. Last ten times as long
as a conventional light-bulb.

298
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,219
Uses only a quarter of the power.

299
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:26,193
Superwindows. They insulate
as well as ten sheets of glass.

300
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:31,335
An electric car,
partially powered by solar panels.

301
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,300
But the truth is, gentlemen,

302
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:37,942
that I'm not worried about
any of these things.

303
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:42,545
Because no one is ever
going to know about them.

304
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:46,774
- What about Meinheimer and his report?
- He's going to tell the President.

305
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:50,854
Good question.
Why don't we just ask him?

306
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,689
- That's kidnapping!
- Good heavens!

307
00:24:55,894 --> 00:25:01,093
- What about his speech on Tuesday?
- Dr. Meinheimer will deliver his speech.

308
00:25:01,299 --> 00:25:06,965
It is my view that we must rely on
coal, oil and nuclear energy.

309
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:09,639
<i>Our</i> Dr. Meinheimer.

310
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,435
- Oh, my God!
- That's incredible!

311
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:16,743
Meet Earl Hacker,
former arts consultant to Jesse Helms.

312
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:24,886
As I explained to Mr. Hapsburg,
my fee is one million dollars,

313
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:29,618
and, might I add,
I'm worth every penny of it.

314
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:33,320
But you gentlemen
don't have any choice.

315
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,796
Do you?

316
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:51,339
<i>After a good night's sleep,</i>
<i>I headed back to police headquarters.</i>

317
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,178
<i>I figured that if I buried myself</i>
<i>in police work,</i>

318
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,378
<i>I could forget about Jane</i>
<i>and maybe in the process</i>

319
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,989
<i>catch a vicious killer</i>
<i>before he struck again.</i>

320
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:03,888
<i>So far we had few clues</i>
<i>and no real leads.</i>

321
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:07,258
<i>I was hoping that the lab boys</i>
<i>had come up with something.</i>

322
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:08,659
Shut it off!

323
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,131
- Take it easy.
- Say your prayers.

324
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:15,566
- Nice work.
- What?

325
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:19,175
Can you show us the results
from the Research Institute?

326
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:21,345
We weren't able to get
any clean fingerprints,

327
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:25,675
but we did find footprints
outside the Institute.

328
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,650
We made plaster casts of them.
A size 91/2 D.

329
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,880
We're running a trace on it.
But more interesting...

330
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,958
We also found this dinosaur footprint.

331
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:40,188
- A major find from the Paleolithic era.
- Anything else?

332
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:45,734
Yes, 20 feet down we discovered
ancient timbers from Noah's Ark.

333
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,598
About the case...

334
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,967
I'll be leaving for Boston tomorrow
where I'll deliver a major address

335
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:55,670
to the American Archaeological Society.
And I'm booked on <i>Geraldo</i> next week.

336
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,940
You're going on <i>Geraldo</i>
because of this?

337
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,984
No, my wife is a transsexual
Satan worshipper.

338
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:05,054
Meanwhile, we'll be continuing
fingerprint analysis,

339
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:08,748
fiber checks,
DNA breakdown and hair samples.

340
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,225
Then, using the microscopic dirt particles
on this footprint,

341
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:15,490
we'll get a geological breakdown
of the entire city.

342
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:19,636
- We may not have that kind of time.
- Then maybe this will help.

343
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:24,534
We found this wallet
on the curb outside the Institute.

344
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:29,942
We haven't examined it thoroughly.
It just came down from the lab.

345
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:35,747
"Hector Savage". From Detroit.
I remember this pug.

346
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,946
Ex-boxer.
His real name was Joey Chicago.

347
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:42,251
Yeah. He fought
under the name of Kid Minneapolis.

348
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,520
I saw Kid Minneapolis fight once,
in Cincinnati.

349
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:48,198
No, that's Kid New York.
He fought out of Philly.

350
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,563
He was killed in the ring in Houston
by Tex Colorado.

351
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,738
- The Arizona Assassin.
- Yeah, from Dakota.

352
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:56,998
- Was it North or South?
- North.

353
00:27:57,242 --> 00:28:00,109
South Dakota was his brother.
From West Virginia.

354
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,338
You sure know your boxing.

355
00:28:02,547 --> 00:28:04,515
All I know is:
never bet on the white guy.

356
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,518
- You've got an address?
- The card says, "Monique De Carlo".

357
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:12,349
"210 Bleckman Street."

358
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:17,358
That's the red-light district. I wonder
why Savage is hanging out down there.

359
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,496
Sex, Frank?

360
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:24,668
No, not right now, Ed.
We've got work to do.

361
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:32,066
<i>The address we had for De Carlo</i>
<i>was in the city's Little Italy.</i>

362
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:36,680
<i>We went there, hoping it would</i>
<i>lead us to Hector Savage</i>

363
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,942
<i>and lead us to a clue</i>
<i>that would break the case wide open.</i>

364
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:46,317
That's the cops.
You've got to get rid of them.

365
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:50,654
All right, I'll handle it.
Quick, hide in the basement.

366
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:53,456
You'll be safe down there.

367
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,165
- Ed.
- Frank.

368
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,029
- Red van.
- Yes, I know.

369
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,570
Jane said that she saw a red van
outside the Institute before the explosion.

370
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,040
- Let's take him down.
- No, he's not working alone.

371
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,078
- Bug the van. See where it goes.
- Good thinking.

372
00:29:10,281 --> 00:29:12,647
- Nordberg!
- No problem.

373
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:20,021
Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
This is my Captain, Ed Hocken.

374
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:24,093
- Is this some kind of bust?
- It's very impressive, yes...

375
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:27,162
But we need to ask you
a few questions.

376
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:39,236
Listen. We're looking for
Hector Savage. Where is he?

377
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,537
Why should I tell you?

378
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,681
Because I'm the last line of defense
between sleaze like this

379
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:47,545
and the decent people in this town.

380
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:54,157
Hi, Frank. We got that D-83 Swedish
Sure-Grip Suck Machine you ordered.

381
00:29:55,593 --> 00:29:57,060
It's a gift.

382
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:19,282
Frank, come here. Quick!
It's Savage. He's on the move.

383
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,351
What? Hey!

384
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:29,357
Hey! Stop, stop! I'm a police officer!

385
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:34,289
Let's go. But remember,
we can't let him spot us.

386
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,794
Pull over!

387
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:41,862
Nordberg's bugging device
is right on the money.

388
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,540
I'm not kidding! Stop!

389
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:48,643
Shit!

390
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:52,079
He's changing direction. Stop the car.

391
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,978
Oh, no!

392
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,746
- He's getting closer.
- We should see him any minute.

393
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,355
Keep your eyes peeled.

394
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:01,047
Oh, no!

395
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,261
Look, he's real close now.

396
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,557
Step on it!

397
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,701
Help! Stop, stop!

398
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:30,985
Frank, stop!

399
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:35,489
Stop right now! I've had it!
I said stop!

400
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,904
Help!

401
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,768
Drebin, Police Squad.
What do we have?

402
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:55,571
It's a tense situation.
Savage is holed up in that house.

403
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,546
- Says he's got hostages.
- He could be bluffing. Anything else?

404
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:05,246
Yeah. That red van is registered
to one Quentin Hapsburg.

405
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:12,327
Well, it looks like the cows
have come home to roost.

406
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:14,555
How are you doing, trooper?

407
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:19,970
Hey, stop firing!

408
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:23,639
Hold it! Stop firing!

409
00:32:26,577 --> 00:32:31,173
Stop firing! Stop firing!

410
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:35,583
All right, give me the bullhorn.

411
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,085
This is Frank Drebin, Police Squad.

412
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:42,555
Throw down your guns
and come out with your hands up,

413
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,992
or come on out, then throw down
your guns, whichever you want.

414
00:32:47,198 --> 00:32:49,291
Remember the two key elements:

415
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:53,834
One, guns to be thrown down.
Two, come on out.

416
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:59,169
You just try and take me, Drebin!
I've got more if you want them, copper!

417
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:02,835
- Looks like he's holding all the cards.
- Not all the cards.

418
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:04,378
<i>How about it?</i>

419
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:07,347
You can't drive that tank!
You're not checked-out on it!

420
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,578
Don't worry, Ed!
Just keep him busy.

421
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,755
All right, what do you want?

422
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:17,860
I want a car out front.
Something fun. A Porsche.

423
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,929
Then I want a plane ticket to Jamaica.
And I want a nice hotel.

424
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,694
<i>No touristy place.</i>

425
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,926
Something indicative of
the people and their culture.

426
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,633
We can't do that.
We're calling your bluff.

427
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:33,675
<i>Now put your hands on top of your head</i>
<i>and come out.</i>

428
00:33:33,878 --> 00:33:37,473
<i>We've got you surrounded</i>
<i>front and... hey!</i>

429
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:43,620
<i>Frank, what are you doing?</i>
<i>Where are you going? Frank!</i>

430
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,423
<i>Frank! Help!</i>

431
00:34:45,216 --> 00:34:47,776
- Your coat, sir?
- Yes, it is.

432
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,886
And I have a receipt to prove it.

433
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,081
- Telephone call, Commissioner.
- Thank you.

434
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,726
Excuse me.

435
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:59,095
Yes?

436
00:35:00,331 --> 00:35:02,765
He did what?

437
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,595
How many animals escaped?
Oh, my God!

438
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:10,740
Good evening, Commissioner.
You're looking lovely tonight.

439
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:15,776
Do you realize that because of you
this city is being overrun by baboons?

440
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,006
Well, isn't that the fault of the voters?

441
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,775
Excuse me.

442
00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:32,254
Thank you all for attending this
event in honor of Dr. Meinheimer,

443
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:36,160
who tomorrow
will make his historic address.

444
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:45,437
Along with the President, I pledge
to support his recommendations,

445
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,305
whatever they may be.

446
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:57,321
And now, please enjoy the evening.

447
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,889
I'll see you later.

448
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:16,696
May I cut in?

449
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,569
- What are you doing here?
- I enjoy a good party.

450
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:23,645
- Why are you really here?
- I can sum that up in three words:

451
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:28,581
"Quentin Hapsburg." I never liked him
from the moment I laid eyes on him.

452
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:31,483
The man is as dirty
as a coalminer's underwear in January.

453
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:35,420
What's gotten into you?
He's a kind, gentle, concerned man,

454
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:40,723
who cares about people and is not
as suspicious as some people I know.

455
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:44,925
Ask him what his connection is with the
van you saw the night of the explosion.

456
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:46,136
I don't know what you're talking about.

457
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,340
Ask him if he's pals with
a two-bit goon named Hector Savage.

458
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,610
Stop it! You're just jealous
because another man can give me

459
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,111
the understanding that you never could.

460
00:36:58,282 --> 00:37:02,981
I just hope Quentin is watching
right now, because he'll be jealous.

461
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:06,953
And a jealous man
always makes the wrong move.

462
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,388
I'm counting on that!

463
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:51,595
Mr. Drebin, Mr. Hapsburg
would like you to join him at his table.

464
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:04,106
- Solitaire is a lonely man's game.
- Lieutenant!

465
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:09,312
I don't recall seeing your name
on the guest list.

466
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,685
Nothing to be embarrassed about.
I sometimes go by my maiden name.

467
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:19,593
Nice party.
I see a lot of familiar face-lifts.

468
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:26,599
- Do you gamble, Lieutenant?
- Every time I order out.

469
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,798
<i>Que sera, sera...</i>

470
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:34,705
- You do speak French, don't you?
- Unfortunately, no.

471
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,972
But I do kiss that way.

472
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,674
Excuse me!
You happen to be standing in my place.

473
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:43,251
Dr. Meinheimer, you remember Frank?

474
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:48,357
- Uh... Mister...
- Drebin, from Police Squad.

475
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:53,656
- You met him at the Institute.
- Yes, of course! Do sit down.

476
00:38:53,864 --> 00:38:56,332
Thank you, I don't intend to stay.

477
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,593
Let's play another game. Who's this?

478
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,602
- I wouldn't know.
- He's been a bad boy.

479
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:10,076
He blew up a building and
is driving a van registered in your name.

480
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:14,445
We own lots of vans.
One of them was stolen three days ago.

481
00:39:14,618 --> 00:39:17,178
Look, Lieutenant, I have nothing to hide.

482
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:19,515
Maybe, but I'm warning you.

483
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:23,785
If you so much as sneeze,
I'll be there to wipe your nose.

484
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:34,730
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for
the first door prize of the evening:

485
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:39,739
an all-expense-paid trip
to the Gilligan Islands.

486
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:46,542
And to draw the first winner,
we would like to ask our guest of honor:

487
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:50,050
Dr. Albert S. Meinheimer.

488
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:55,749
- Let me help you.
- That won't be necessary.

489
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,656
I don't understand
what's gotten into Frank.

490
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,957
I'm afraid it's merely
a case of jealousy, my dear.

491
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:07,069
You're going to wear all my gears down.
We shouldn't push it like this.

492
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:49,936
- He gets around marvelously.
- He does.

493
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,044
- Frank?
- Jane.

494
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:09,158
I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry
about what happened tonight.

495
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,296
- Oh, Frank.
- I need to talk to you. May I come in?

496
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:16,466
OK, but the place is kind of a mess.

497
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,636
I was about to make a protein shake.
Do you want some?

498
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:23,329
No, thank you.

499
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:26,941
Are you sure?
I'm trying out a new recipe tonight.

500
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:31,308
Do you know what Dr. Meinheimer
will say at the dinner tomorrow?

501
00:42:31,482 --> 00:42:35,441
Yes, he'll endorse energy efficiency
and renewable energy like solar power.

502
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:40,454
- Who else knew that?
- Only me. And I told Quentin.

503
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:45,118
And if the President adopts a policy of
supporting efficiency and solar energy,

504
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,854
who would be the biggest losers?

505
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,032
Coal, oil and nuclear.

506
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:55,671
- Frank! Frank!
- Just one more question.

507
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:59,036
You told me that Dr. Meinheimer
had a photographic memory,

508
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:03,009
yet tonight
he never recalled meeting me.

509
00:43:03,213 --> 00:43:06,580
That's strange, but he has been
under a lot of stress lately.

510
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:11,084
Does he have any identifying marks?
A scar, a mole, a tattoo,

511
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:14,155
webbed toes or a third nostril?

512
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:18,761
He has a birthmark in the shape of
<i>Whistler's Mother</i> on his right buttock.

513
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:23,991
I see... Have you noticed
anything different about him?

514
00:43:24,234 --> 00:43:29,604
Only that he is a foot taller
and seems to be left-handed now.

515
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:32,367
Frank! What are you trying to tell me?

516
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:35,909
That Quentin has found
a double for Dr. Meinheimer

517
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:38,946
and that he will give
a fraudulent report to the President?

518
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:43,246
That's brilliant. That's a lot better
than what I had come up with.

519
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:47,550
Stop it, this is preposterous!
Is there no end to your jealousy?

520
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:50,158
Jane, you're hurting me.

521
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,886
- What more do you want from me?
- Can I use your phone?

522
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:55,395
- Local call?
- Yes.

523
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:59,035
If you'll excuse me,
I have to take my shower.

524
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:04,104
The phone is in the other room.
You can let yourself out. Goodbye.

525
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:23,591
Give me Captain Ed Hocken, please.

526
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:36,465
Ed, I'm onto something big.
I'll need you and Nordberg tomorrow.

527
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:39,437
What is he doing in Detroit?

528
00:44:39,643 --> 00:44:42,111
Send him the plane fare
and a new pair of pants.

529
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:37,096
<i>Of the way we were</i>

530
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:40,531
<i>Memories</i>

531
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:45,504
<i>Like the colors of my mind</i>

532
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:49,668
<i>Misty water-colored memories</i>

533
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:56,010
<i>Of the way we were</i>

534
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:00,714
<i>Scattered pictures</i>

535
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:06,021
<i>Of the smiles we left behind</i>

536
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:12,430
<i>Smiles we gave to one another</i>

537
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:16,400
<i>Of the way we were</i>

538
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:21,374
<i>Can it be that it was all so simple then</i>

539
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:23,978
<i>Or has time rewritten...</i>

540
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:28,847
<i>Frank!</i>

541
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,603
Just as I suspected.

542
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:24,336
Come on, on your feet.

543
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,837
Jane...

544
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:01,135
What happened to the water pressure?

545
00:48:01,345 --> 00:48:02,539
Jane!

546
00:48:05,482 --> 00:48:06,881
Frank!

547
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:10,452
I was so frightened!

548
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:14,924
- What happened out there?
- It's nothing to worry about.

549
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:19,221
But if I were you, I wouldn't leave
until they shampoo the carpets.

550
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:24,093
- Who would want to kill you?
- Before tonight, only the cable company.

551
00:48:24,334 --> 00:48:29,829
Now I'm afraid it's one of
Hapsburg's goons. He was carrying this.

552
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:37,236
Oh, Frank! I feel like such a fool.

553
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:41,777
- I should never have doubted you.
- There, there...

554
00:48:41,985 --> 00:48:46,354
You couldn't know that the man you
were dating was a murdering sociopath.

555
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,524
Oh, Frank!
We have to help Dr. Meinheimer.

556
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,853
- He's in danger.
- Yes.

557
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,690
They'll probably torture him,
then kill him.

558
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:56,490
It's all my fault!

559
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:00,932
They'll start by tearing out his toenails
and then move on to the nosehairs.

560
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:03,605
Oh, no! What are we going to do?

561
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:07,674
If my hunch is right,
they're holding him hostage here.

562
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:11,314
- At the Home Club?
- What? No!

563
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:15,383
At this warehouse.
I've got to get going to rescue him.

564
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:19,077
- You'll be careful?
- Of course I will.

565
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,119
I will...

566
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:27,186
I guess I'd better be on my way.

567
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:31,967
I promised Nordberg
we'd bake a raisin nutbread tonight.

568
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,700
I can't fight it any more!

569
00:49:38,909 --> 00:49:44,973
I ran away from you once. I can't do it
again. Will you stay with me? Please?

570
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:54,336
Frank, we've got
no business doing this.

571
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:57,062
We've only got a dock pass
and your hunch.

572
00:52:57,307 --> 00:53:03,075
Hapsburg is up to something right up
to his pretty, imported shirt collar.

573
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:11,176
It's a perfect day. This fog'll keep us
concealed to Hapsburg's warehouse.

574
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:16,382
That's not fog. The number two
engine's on fire. They're putting it out.

575
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:19,027
Let's run through this one more time.

576
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:23,359
At 3:15, Nordberg will cut
the power lines, knocking out the alarms.

577
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,760
Yeah. Right.

578
00:53:25,001 --> 00:53:27,026
- Nordberg.
- Got it.

579
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:30,296
I'll be in the van waiting for your signal.
Are you wired-up?

580
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,065
Yeah. Right.

581
00:53:33,276 --> 00:53:37,736
When you hear me say,
"I love it", you guys move in.

582
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:39,905
- Check.
- Ready, Frank?

583
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,217
The water's over there.

584
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:58,960
<i>Hexagon oil commercial</i>
<i>number one.</i>

585
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:04,838
<i>Piloting today's giant oil tankers</i>
<i>is a big responsibility.</i>

586
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:08,442
<i>That's why here at Hexagon's</i>
<i>Tanker Captain Training School,</i>

587
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:12,273
<i>future captains go through</i>
<i>a rigorous instruction programme.</i>

588
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:14,610
<i>Through a complicated</i>
<i>elimination process,</i>

589
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:18,049
<i>we weed out those less qualified</i>
<i>for the day-to-day operation</i>

590
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,190
<i>of a 500,000-tonne</i>
<i>single hull super tanker.</i>

591
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:23,689
<i>Only the best will take command</i>

592
00:54:23,893 --> 00:54:27,989
<i>of what is essentially</i>
<i>a floating ecological time bomb.</i>

593
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:41,276
<i>Commercial two.</i>

594
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:45,544
<i>Just the way I like it!</i>

595
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:49,110
<i>Some day, way into the future,</i>

596
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:53,847
<i>the sun may be able to</i>
<i>provide for all our energy needs.</i>

597
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:56,548
<i>But right now,</i>
<i>it gives us a comfortable feeling</i>

598
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:00,753
<i>to know that our home</i>
<i>is being supplied by nuclear power.</i>

599
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,592
<i>I know what you're thinking,</i>
<i>but we're not worried.</i>

600
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,496
<i>We know that nuclear energy is safe.</i>

601
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:10,900
<i>In fact, we think of it as</i>
<i>our friendly neighbor.</i>

602
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:14,838
<i>But remember, our friend can't exist</i>
<i>without huge government subsidies.</i>

603
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:18,310
<i>So tell your congressman</i>
<i>to keep those government dollars</i>

604
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,949
<i>rolling into nuclear power.</i>

605
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,721
I'll have to find another way in, Ed.

606
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:32,053
<i>They've got killer guard dogs here.</i>
<i>Do you read me?</i>

607
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:34,924
Loud and clear.
Nordberg, how are we doing?

608
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,894
We're at our destination.

609
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,573
Ed, I'm going to try the roof.

610
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:51,838
<i>I'm going to try it again.</i>

611
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:36,317
<i>- Cut the power line.</i>
- Right.

612
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:41,387
Help!

613
00:56:41,598 --> 00:56:45,625
Come in, Nordberg.
Frank, hold on. We have a problem.

614
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:00,240
Well... It's Lieutenant Drebin.

615
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:04,547
You were supposed to
have been killed last night.

616
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:09,882
But now I think I'm going to
enjoy doing it myself.

617
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:13,256
It'll be slow and painful.

618
00:57:18,134 --> 00:57:21,626
- What's that smell?
- That would be me.

619
00:57:21,871 --> 00:57:25,773
I have been swimming in raw sewage.
I love it.

620
00:57:27,177 --> 00:57:28,542
I love it!

621
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:31,578
That's the signal, let's go.

622
00:57:33,983 --> 00:57:36,281
It's stuck. Give me a hand.

623
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,046
Ed, help me! Ed!

624
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:40,890
Search him.

625
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:48,255
I love it!

626
00:57:52,569 --> 00:57:54,628
He's wired!

627
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,533
Tie him up!

628
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:01,767
You'll never get away
with this, Hapsburg.

629
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:05,812
- Whatever it is...
- All right, I'll show you.

630
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:10,043
Let me introduce you to some people.

631
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:16,089
Of course, you know Dr. Meinheimer.
And you've met Earl Hacker.

632
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:19,284
Why you son of a...

633
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,464
And then I'd like you
to meet the Redmans.

634
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:26,225
Weekend guests from out of town.

635
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:30,733
We're going to the Press Club Dinner.
Make sure nothing happens to Drebin

636
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,907
until I come back.

637
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:38,205
Then I want the pleasure
of killing you myself.

638
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:40,679
The pleasure is all mine.

639
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:48,085
See you after the speech, Lieutenant.

640
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:22,248
- Freeze!
- That's it. Freeze!

641
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,044
Don't move!

642
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:29,322
Good Lord!
Look at what they did to Dr. Meinheimer.

643
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,287
Are you OK, Dr. Meinheimer?

644
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,628
That's OK. Don't try to talk.

645
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:44,897
I just can't take this any more.

646
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:48,167
Garbage like you just makes me sick!

647
01:00:48,378 --> 01:00:49,868
- Ed...
- OK?

648
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:55,484
I'm just John Q. Public now.
It's just you and me.

649
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,082
- Mano a mano.
- Ed...

650
01:00:58,287 --> 01:01:01,586
I'll teach you to pick on
a helpless invalid!

651
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,662
All right, he's had enough!

652
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,597
Somebody help the Captain.
We've got to get to that dinner.

653
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,412
Any predictions, Mr. Sununu?

654
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:28,141
There won't be any surprises
in Dr. Meinheimer's address.

655
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:32,048
He'll recommend that the President
continues our policy of oil dependency,

656
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:36,224
and more dollars for subsidizing nuclear
power, as I've recommended myself.

657
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:40,863
We'll have more on the dinner later and
an update on the escaped zoo animals.

658
01:01:41,064 --> 01:01:46,161
This is the most important evening
of my career. We can't afford mistakes.

659
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:49,701
If you see Drebin or
any Police Squad near these premises,

660
01:01:49,906 --> 01:01:52,136
I want them arrested on sight.

661
01:01:54,777 --> 01:01:57,712
I told Jane to meet us
at the hotel's rear entrance.

662
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,075
- Where's that?
- In the back.

663
01:02:00,283 --> 01:02:02,444
She'll unlock the doors at 7:30.

664
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:06,349
- What about Hapsburg?
- Hopefully, she can stay clear of him.

665
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,547
Let's go.

666
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:26,566
Why, Jane!

667
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:30,507
What are you doing out here?
The party's inside.

668
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:34,639
Quentin! I was just getting
a breath of fresh air.

669
01:02:39,222 --> 01:02:42,350
I grew up on Lake Erie.
There's nothing quite like it.

670
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:44,992
Well, I'm quite sure...

671
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:50,188
But how fortunate to have found you.
Now you can join me at my table.

672
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:04,870
Jane! Something
must have happened to Jane.

673
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,914
Bernardo, you've got the keys?

674
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:13,177
I have a better idea. Follow me!

675
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:17,689
Your attention, please.
Ladies and gentlemen.

676
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:20,658
Thousand points of... light.
Light, a thousand points of light.

677
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:25,800
Recession... bad. Recovery... good.
Yeah, I think I've got that.

678
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:30,904
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

679
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:06,369
<i>Bésame</i>

680
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:10,205
<i>Bésame mucho...</i>

681
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:17,752
<i>Each time I cling to your kiss</i>
<i>I hear music divine</i>

682
01:04:19,388 --> 01:04:26,021
<i>Bésame mucho</i>

683
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:33,399
<i>Hold me, my darling,</i>
<i>and say that you'll always be mine</i>

684
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:35,695
We'd better make our move.

685
01:04:35,938 --> 01:04:40,341
Yeah, I'm thinking about something
more up-tempo, like <i>Guantanamera.</i>

686
01:04:40,576 --> 01:04:44,569
No, I mean Hacker!
He's getting ready to make a speech.

687
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:50,185
Right! I'll intercept Hacker. You get
the doctor prepared for his speech.

688
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:10,469
Bravo! Encore!

689
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:20,244
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

690
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:23,009
- Dr. Meinheimer.
- Yes?

691
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:26,552
- Or should I say Hacker?
- Drebin!

692
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:33,220
Look what he's doing
to that man in the wheelchair!

693
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:37,661
- Can't someone help?
- Come on, guys. Let's get him!

694
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:41,301
- Give me a shot at him!
- Beating a guy in a wheelchair, huh?

695
01:05:41,537 --> 01:05:45,268
- We'd better get this man first aid.
- Sit tight, mister.

696
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:48,371
Thank you.

697
01:05:48,577 --> 01:05:54,106
I'm pleased and honored to be with you
tonight on this historic occasion.

698
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:58,014
Tonight, Dr. Meinheimer,
as he looks up to the future,

699
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,883
no doubt realizes
how our dependence on foreign oil

700
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:04,616
has put a stranglehold on the budget.

701
01:06:04,827 --> 01:06:09,321
A lot of cuts will have to be made
and some people will be hit hard.

702
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:12,831
But we'll just keep cutting
until we have an impact.

703
01:06:13,069 --> 01:06:16,368
That's the only way
we'll be able to move forward.

704
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:20,770
Now I present to you
Dr. Albert S. Meinheimer.

705
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:39,084
Oh, my God! He can walk!

706
01:06:39,295 --> 01:06:41,729
He can walk! It's a miracle!

707
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:47,158
I can walk!

708
01:06:48,371 --> 01:06:50,737
Get off me, you moron!

709
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:56,470
<i>Hey, come back here!</i>

710
01:06:56,679 --> 01:07:01,673
Everything seems to be OK now,
so without further ado,

711
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:05,878
<i>I present to you, once again,</i>
<i>the man who needs no introduction,</i>

712
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:10,684
<i>the esteemed Dr. Albert S. Meinheimer.</i>

713
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:24,706
Hold it! Hold everything!

714
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:29,109
- Don't listen to him. He's a fraud!
- No!

715
01:07:29,311 --> 01:07:32,246
- I can prove it!
- What are you doing?

716
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:34,713
The real doctor has a birthmark

717
01:07:34,917 --> 01:07:36,885
in the shape of <i>Whistler's Mother</i>
right here!

718
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:49,094
Obviously a forgery.
We'll see about this!

719
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:52,694
Drebin!

720
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:14,913
Hold it! Frank is right.
There is a fraud in this room,

721
01:08:15,124 --> 01:08:17,649
but it's this man!

722
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:23,828
And he's just given us this signed
confession, implicating that man!

723
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:29,771
No, no, no...

724
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:33,139
That man - Quentin Hapsburg.

725
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,770
- They're gone!
- Let's go!

726
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:49,120
- Let me go!
- The roof.

727
01:08:50,092 --> 01:08:53,528
Come on, Frank, hurry!
Come on!

728
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:04,229
Tonight, I intend to share with you
my report

729
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,771
on our need for a national policy

730
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:12,471
based on energy efficiency and clean,
renewable energy sources.

731
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,746
Over there!

732
01:09:19,955 --> 01:09:21,889
Frank!

733
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,853
Take cover!

734
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:12,672
Nordberg! Cover me, I'm going in!

735
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:45,240
All right. Where's Hapsburg?

736
01:10:46,208 --> 01:10:48,642
- Where are you hit?
- It's not that.

737
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:52,041
- You're on my groin.
- Oh, sorry.

738
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:54,876
- Where is he?
- You're too late.

739
01:10:55,718 --> 01:10:58,482
Hapsburg has Plan B in...

740
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:01,053
...in... in...

741
01:11:02,057 --> 01:11:05,220
Where, where? All right.

742
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:08,123
Who else is almost dead?

743
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:12,194
OK, now...

744
01:11:13,335 --> 01:11:15,963
- Talk!
- You're too late, Drebin.

745
01:11:16,205 --> 01:11:18,969
- He already said that.
- Where did he leave off?

746
01:11:19,174 --> 01:11:22,405
"Hapsburg has Plan B in..."

747
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:26,547
Oh, yeah. Hapsburg has Plan B in...

748
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:29,411
...in...
- Where?

749
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:32,951
Where? Talk, you low-life scum!

750
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:36,613
Gee, if that's your attitude, forget it!

751
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,757
I'm right here, Drebin.

752
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:48,259
Drop your gun, Lieutenant.

753
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,371
I believe you're inquiring about Plan B.

754
01:11:56,111 --> 01:11:59,547
That's where we detonate
a small nuclear device.

755
01:11:59,715 --> 01:12:03,151
Your Dr. Meinheimer
can talk all he wants.

756
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:05,718
No one will be left alive to hear it.

757
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:07,980
<i>Detonation sequence activated.</i>

758
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:11,523
I'm the only one
who knows the abort code.

759
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:14,924
In ten minutes,
this building and everyone in it

760
01:12:15,130 --> 01:12:17,621
will be reduced to a pile of rubble.

761
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:20,631
I'll be safely on my helicopter.

762
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:24,669
By this time tomorrow,
I'll be hunting rhino in Botswana.

763
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:27,034
What do you think of that?

764
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:31,679
You certainly seem to be
in touch with your anger.

765
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:35,248
I don't care what you think.
You won't talk your way out of this.

766
01:12:35,451 --> 01:12:39,046
Go ahead! Threaten me like you have
the American people for so long.

767
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:42,189
But it won't work this time.
You're part of a dying breed,

768
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:47,090
like people who can name all 50 states.
The truth hurts, doesn't it?

769
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:50,857
Maybe not as much as jumping on
a bicycle with the seat missing,

770
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,397
but it hurts.

771
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:56,593
That's as far as you go, Drebin.
Any final requests, Lieutenant?

772
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,502
Yes. Can I have the gun?

773
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:05,407
Oh, no. I'm not going to fall for that one.

774
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:07,674
Not so fast!

775
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:25,422
<i>Six minutes to detonation.</i>

776
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:29,935
- All right, talk! Give me that abort code.
- OK, I'll talk.

777
01:13:30,139 --> 01:13:32,733
- Six numbers - 2, 1, 7...
- I'm coming, Frank!

778
01:13:37,179 --> 01:13:38,771
Thanks a lot.

779
01:13:55,330 --> 01:13:57,821
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Are you OK?

780
01:13:58,033 --> 01:14:02,902
Yes, but unless we can disarm
this computer, the building will blow.

781
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,539
We must warn everyone.

782
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:11,406
- Jane, you'd better go.
- No, Frank. I'm staying here with you.

783
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,013
But Jane...

784
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:16,184
If you're going to be blown to bits,
I want to be here with you.

785
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:24,348
Jane, I promise you
that if we ever come out of this alive,

786
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,496
I'll never let my police work
interfere with our love again.

787
01:14:29,498 --> 01:14:31,796
Frank. Frank!

788
01:14:32,868 --> 01:14:35,393
The bomb.
Let's go, Nordberg.

789
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:38,037
<i>Four minutes to detonation.</i>

790
01:14:38,707 --> 01:14:42,108
- What are we going to do?
- See what you can find in the manual.

791
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:48,341
Let me see here..."To reset
detonation code, press pound sign."

792
01:14:49,751 --> 01:14:53,482
<i>Per your command, the speed</i>
<i>of this sequence has been increased.</i>

793
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:56,385
<i>Detonation now in two minutes.</i>

794
01:14:56,592 --> 01:15:01,962
So instead of spending
2.5 billion dollars

795
01:15:02,164 --> 01:15:06,032
on research
into nuclear waste disposal,

796
01:15:06,268 --> 01:15:10,534
the Federal Government,
for only 500 million dollars,

797
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:13,936
or the cost of one B-1 bomber,

798
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:19,876
could reduce the price
of solar panels by 90%.

799
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:24,246
As Albert Einstein once said...

800
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:27,354
Wake up, wake up!

801
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:30,184
Wake up, the place is going to blow!

802
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:35,559
I'll get the lights.

803
01:15:37,132 --> 01:15:40,898
To elaborate on point 102...

804
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:43,570
Here, read this. It's an emergency.

805
01:15:46,675 --> 01:15:50,133
"His strong, manly hands

806
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:55,510
"probed every crevice
of her silken femininity,

807
01:15:56,919 --> 01:16:00,946
"their undulating bodies
writhing in a sensual rhythm

808
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:04,922
"as he thrust his purple-headed warrior

809
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:08,290
"into her quivering mound
of love pudding."

810
01:16:08,497 --> 01:16:13,230
Listen up, everyone. I want you
to calmly file towards the exits.

811
01:16:13,468 --> 01:16:18,701
That's it. Nobody run.
Just walk, single file.

812
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:21,967
That's it. If we'll just stay calm,

813
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:25,943
no one will be harmed by the huge bomb
that's going to explode.

814
01:16:33,622 --> 01:16:36,557
It's a cookbook, it's a cookbook!

815
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:40,858
<i>Twenty seconds to detonation.</i>

816
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:44,657
- What are you going to do?
<i>- 15 seconds.</i>

817
01:16:45,901 --> 01:16:48,131
- It's got my sleeve!
- Oh, no!

818
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,530
<i>10, 9, 8...</i>

819
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,802
- I can't get it.
- Jane, my jacket!

820
01:16:54,009 --> 01:16:57,945
<i>5, 4, 3...</i>

821
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:00,013
<i>- ... 2, 1...</i>
- Let's get out!

822
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:06,349
Frank, look!

823
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:10,050
You did it!

824
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:22,734
Thank you,
Mr. President, for those kind words,

825
01:17:22,938 --> 01:17:25,498
but it's all part of the job.

826
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:29,768
Frank, I'd like you to consider filling
a special post I'm going to create.

827
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:32,970
It may mean long hours,
dangerous nights,

828
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:37,312
and being surrounded by some of
the scummiest elements in our society.

829
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:40,420
You want me to be in your cabinet?

830
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:43,318
No... No!

831
01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:48,656
I want you to head up
a new Federal Bureau of Police Squad.

832
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,661
- That's a great honor.
- It's what you've always wanted.

833
01:17:55,904 --> 01:17:57,064
Congratulations.

834
01:17:57,305 --> 01:17:59,239
Nice going!

835
01:17:59,975 --> 01:18:04,309
- Get in here.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

836
01:18:05,714 --> 01:18:08,615
Thank you. I'm very honored.

837
01:18:08,817 --> 01:18:16,121
This is something I've always dreamt of,
but I'll have to turn down your offer.

838
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:20,483
You see, I've learnt something
this past week

839
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:23,631
about the Earth and about love.

840
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,429
I guess love is like the ozone layer.

841
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:30,365
You never miss it until it's gone.

842
01:18:31,173 --> 01:18:35,109
Blowing away a fleeing suspect
with my.44 Magnum

843
01:18:35,343 --> 01:18:39,404
used to be everything to me.
I enjoyed it. Who wouldn't?

844
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:46,482
But now I want to be known as
"The Environmental Police Lieutenant".

845
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:55,423
I want a world where Frank Junior,
and all the Frank Juniors,

846
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:57,689
can sit under a shade tree,

847
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:00,993
breathe the air, swim in the ocean,

848
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:04,501
and go into a 7-Eleven
without an interpreter.

849
01:19:11,079 --> 01:19:16,073
I want a world where I can eat
a sea otter without getting sick.

850
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:21,722
I want a world where the Democrats
have a candidate worth voting for.

851
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:28,628
I may not get there with you,
but most of all,

852
01:19:28,830 --> 01:19:32,266
I want a world
where I can wake up each morning

853
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:35,334
with this woman, whom I love!

854
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,201
Yikes!

855
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:42,467
- Frank!
- Jane!

856
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:48,773
- Jane, will you marry me?
- Yes, of course I'll marry you!

857
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:57,483
We love Frank! We love Frank!

858
01:19:57,692 --> 01:20:00,786
One more picture.
Turn around, over here!

859
01:20:00,996 --> 01:20:02,361
Smile!

860
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:09,433
Help, George!

861
01:24:27,095 --> 01:24:28,995
<i>All right, let's see</i>
<i>if I got this straight, now.</i>

862
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:32,158
<i>Energy efficiency... good.</i>

863
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:37,770
<i>Drilling in</i>
<i>Arctic national wildlife refuge... bad.</i>

864
01:24:38,873 --> 01:24:41,569
<i>Mr. President,</i>
<i>is everything OK in there?</i>

865
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:44,472
<i>I'm fine, thanks.</i>
