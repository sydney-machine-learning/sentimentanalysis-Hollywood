1
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:41,460
Edmund! Get away from there!

2
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,160
Peter! What do you think you're doing?

3
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,960
Peter, quickly, the shelter. Now!

4
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,330
- Come on!
- Wait...

5
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,060
Come on, leave it!

6
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,470
Mommy!

7
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,930
Lucy, come on!

8
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,040
- Come on, quickly!
- Run!

9
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,878
Run!

10
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:05,818
- Hurry!
- Mum!

11
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:08,748
- Wait! Dad!
- Ed!

12
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:11,418
- Edmund, no!
- I'll get him!

13
00:02:11,528 --> 00:02:14,858
- Peter, come back!
- Ed! Come here!

14
00:02:14,958 --> 00:02:17,988
Edmund! Get down!

15
00:02:18,098 --> 00:02:21,188
Come on, you idiot, run!

16
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:22,738
Get out!

17
00:02:28,038 --> 00:02:29,808
Come on!

18
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:33,608
Hurry!

19
00:02:34,748 --> 00:02:37,778
Why can't you think of anyone
but yourself? You're so selfish!

20
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:40,878
- You could've got us killed!
- Stop it!

21
00:02:40,988 --> 00:02:44,218
It's OK. Shh.

22
00:02:48,226 --> 00:02:50,756
Why can't you just do as you're told?

23
00:03:00,236 --> 00:03:04,006
Alms for the poor.
Alms for the poor.

24
00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:05,406
God bless you, sir.

25
00:03:05,506 --> 00:03:07,676
Children
and evacuation staff...

26
00:03:07,776 --> 00:03:11,616
You need to keep this on, darling.
All right?

27
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:14,116
You warm enough? Good girl.

28
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:18,676
Say hello to Auntie Laura.
Goodbye, darling, we love you.

29
00:03:19,256 --> 00:03:21,316
If Dad were here,
he wouldn't make us go.

30
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:24,486
If Dad were here, it'd mean the war
was over and we wouldn't have to.

31
00:03:24,596 --> 00:03:27,186
You will listen to your brother,
won't you, Edmund?

32
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:44,874
Promise me you'll look after the others.

33
00:03:44,984 --> 00:03:46,504
I will, Mum.

34
00:03:49,384 --> 00:03:54,254
- Good man.
- All aboard! All aboard!

35
00:03:54,354 --> 00:03:56,584
- Bye, darling!
- Bye!

36
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:59,284
Susan.

37
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:03,294
Be a big girl.

38
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:06,734
Hold on to your brother's hand.
Don't let it go.

39
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:11,294
All right. Off you go.

40
00:04:11,404 --> 00:04:15,364
- All aboard!
- Bye-bye. Love you.

41
00:04:19,282 --> 00:04:23,442
Hey, get off. I know
how to get on a train by myself.

42
00:04:23,552 --> 00:04:25,382
Get off me!

43
00:04:27,152 --> 00:04:29,812
May I have your tickets, please?
Tickets, please.

44
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:30,892
Peter.

45
00:04:30,992 --> 00:04:35,792
- That's right. On you go.
- Yes. Thank you.

46
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:40,732
Come along.
Come along this way, please.

47
00:04:41,632 --> 00:04:44,472
Come on, Lucy.
We have to stick together now.

48
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:48,902
Everything's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be fine.

49
00:04:49,012 --> 00:04:53,672
Bye, Mommy! I love you!

50
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,330
- Bye-bye, dear.
- Bye! We'll miss you! See you soon.

51
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,950
- I love you, Mum! Bye!
- See you soon!

52
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,970
- Write to us, Mum!
- Love you!

53
00:06:14,358 --> 00:06:17,588
Goosey Station. Goosey Station.

54
00:06:23,668 --> 00:06:27,728
Give me your hand. Let's get going.

55
00:07:29,224 --> 00:07:32,424
The professor knew we were coming.

56
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:35,094
Perhaps we've been incorrectly labeled.

57
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:38,174
Come on, hup!

58
00:07:42,804 --> 00:07:46,334
And whoa. Whoa.

59
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:54,414
- Mrs. Macready?
- I'm afraid so.

60
00:07:56,254 --> 00:07:59,784
Is this it, then?
Haven't you brought anything else?

61
00:07:59,894 --> 00:08:01,822
No, ma'am.

62
00:08:02,492 --> 00:08:04,022
It's just us.

63
00:08:05,332 --> 00:08:08,132
Small favors.

64
00:08:09,202 --> 00:08:14,162
Come on.
Good girl. Come on. Come on.

65
00:08:27,852 --> 00:08:32,182
Professor Kirke is not accustomed
to havin' children in this house.

66
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:36,352
And, as such, there are a few rules
we need to follow.

67
00:08:36,462 --> 00:08:38,452
There will no shoutin'.

68
00:08:38,562 --> 00:08:42,862
Or runnin'.
No improper use of the dumbwaiter.

69
00:08:42,962 --> 00:08:45,932
No touchin' of the historical artifacts!

70
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,670
And above all,

71
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:56,010
there shall be no disturbin'
of the professor.

72
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,860
German aircraft
carried out a number of attacks

73
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,510
on Great Britain last night.

74
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,920
The raids, which lasted
for several hours...

75
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:20,460
The sheets feel scratchy.

76
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,570
Wars don't last forever, Lucy.
We'll be home soon.

77
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,340
- Yeah, if home's still there.
- Isn't it time you were in bed?

78
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,778
- Yes, Mum.
- Ed!

79
00:09:33,678 --> 00:09:37,978
You saw outside.
This place is huge.

80
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:40,078
We can do whatever we want here.

81
00:09:40,188 --> 00:09:42,658
Tomorrow's going to be great.

82
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:44,958
Really.

83
00:09:49,698 --> 00:09:53,458
"Gastrovascular."

84
00:09:55,298 --> 00:09:58,198
Come on, Peter. Gastrovascular.

85
00:09:58,308 --> 00:10:01,538
- Is it Latin?
- Yes.

86
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:05,368
Is it Latin for
"worst game ever invented"?

87
00:10:07,578 --> 00:10:10,018
We could play hide and seek.

88
00:10:11,318 --> 00:10:14,348
But we're already having so much fun.

89
00:10:15,218 --> 00:10:18,276
Come on, Peter, please.

90
00:10:18,386 --> 00:10:20,826
Pretty please?

91
00:10:21,326 --> 00:10:25,786
- One, two, three, four...
- What?

92
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:30,766
...five, six, seven, eight,

93
00:10:30,866 --> 00:10:34,596
nine, ten, 11...

94
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:49,286
...24, 25, 26...

95
00:11:05,104 --> 00:11:06,324
I was here first!

96
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:13,892
...75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80,

97
00:12:14,002 --> 00:12:18,962
81, 82, 83, 84,

98
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:23,102
- 85, 86, 85, 86, 87, 88...

99
00:12:23,212 --> 00:12:27,472
...89, 90, 91, 92,

100
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:31,212
93, 94, 95...

101
00:15:23,754 --> 00:15:26,114
Were you hiding from me?

102
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:31,992
No.

103
00:15:32,092 --> 00:15:34,022
Uh, well...

104
00:15:35,362 --> 00:15:36,912
I just... I...

105
00:15:37,032 --> 00:15:39,822
No. No. I-I-I just...

106
00:15:39,932 --> 00:15:42,802
I was just, um...
I didn't want to scare you.

107
00:15:45,072 --> 00:15:49,872
If you don't mind my asking...
what are you?

108
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:53,372
Well, I'm a...
Well, I'm a faun.

109
00:15:53,482 --> 00:15:54,842
And what about you?

110
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:58,142
You must be some kind of
beardless dwarf?

111
00:15:58,252 --> 00:16:01,222
I'm not a dwarf! I'm a girl!

112
00:16:03,052 --> 00:16:07,452
And, actually, I'm tallest in my class.

113
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:14,192
You mean to say that
you're a Daughter of Eve?

114
00:16:14,302 --> 00:16:16,492
Well, my mum's name is Helen.

115
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:21,370
Yes, but you are in fact human.

116
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:24,340
Yes, of course.

117
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:27,630
What are you doing here?

118
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,340
Well, I was hiding in the wardrobe
in the spare room, and...

119
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,540
Spare Oom? Is that in Narnia?

120
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,080
Narnia? What's that?

121
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,710
Well, dear girl,
you're in it.

122
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,190
Everything from the lamppost

123
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:45,730
all the way to Castle Cair Paravel
on the Eastern Ocean,

124
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,490
every stick and stone you see,

125
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,190
every icicle is Narnia.

126
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,190
This is an awfully big wardrobe.

127
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,070
War Drobe? I'm sorry.

128
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,078
Please allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Tumnus.

129
00:17:04,178 --> 00:17:08,118
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Tumnus.
I'm Lucy Pevensie.

130
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:16,188
- Oh, you shake it.
- Uh... Why?

131
00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:20,088
I... I don't know.

132
00:17:20,198 --> 00:17:22,428
People do it when they meet each other.

133
00:17:30,868 --> 00:17:36,138
Well, then, Lucy Pevensie
from the shining city of War Drobe

134
00:17:36,238 --> 00:17:39,148
in the wondrous land of Spare Oom,

135
00:17:39,248 --> 00:17:44,008
how would it be if you came
and had tea with me?

136
00:17:44,118 --> 00:17:46,848
Well, thank you very much, but I...

137
00:17:48,256 --> 00:17:50,546
I probably should be getting back.

138
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:55,246
It's only just around the corner.
And there'll be a glorious fire

139
00:17:55,356 --> 00:17:58,816
with toast and tea and cakes.

140
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:02,386
And, perhaps, we'll even
break into the sardines.

141
00:18:03,336 --> 00:18:06,666
- I don't know.
- Come on.

142
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:09,896
It's not every day
that I get to make a new friend.

143
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:15,416
Well, I suppose I could come
for a little while.

144
00:18:15,516 --> 00:18:16,876
If you have sardines.

145
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:19,676
By the bucketload.

146
00:18:31,426 --> 00:18:33,824
- You all right?
- Mm-hm.

147
00:18:41,334 --> 00:18:42,824
Well, here we are.

148
00:18:42,934 --> 00:18:45,134
Come along.

149
00:18:51,244 --> 00:18:53,444
- After you.
- May I help you with that?

150
00:18:53,544 --> 00:18:56,314
- Thank you very much.
- Oh.

151
00:19:04,694 --> 00:19:06,624
Oh.

152
00:19:13,564 --> 00:19:15,764
Now, that... that is my father.

153
00:19:17,042 --> 00:19:19,162
He has a nice face.

154
00:19:19,942 --> 00:19:21,402
He looks a lot like you.

155
00:19:22,872 --> 00:19:24,572
No.

156
00:19:24,682 --> 00:19:27,582
No, I'm not very much
like him at all, really.

157
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:31,082
My father's fighting in the war.

158
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:35,952
My father went away to war too.

159
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:39,882
But that was a long, long time ago.

160
00:19:40,362 --> 00:19:44,192
- Before this dreadful winter.
- Winter's not all bad.

161
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:48,792
There's ice skating and snowball fights.

162
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:52,772
- Oh! And Christmas!
- Not here.

163
00:19:52,872 --> 00:19:57,812
No. No, we haven't had a Christmas
in a hundred years.

164
00:19:57,912 --> 00:20:01,642
What? No presents for a hundred years?

165
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:04,180
Always winter, never Christmas.

166
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,150
It's been a long winter.

167
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,340
But you would have loved Narnia
in summer.

168
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,720
We fauns danced
with the dryads all night,

169
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:19,760
and, you know, we never got tired.

170
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:24,800
And music. Oh, such music!

171
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:29,270
Would... would you
like to hear some now?

172
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:32,900
Oh! Yes, please.

173
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:40,180
Now, are you familiar

174
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:44,150
- with any Narnian lullabies?
- Sorry, no.

175
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,380
Well, that's good.

176
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,588
Because this... probably
won't sound anything like one.

177
00:22:16,606 --> 00:22:19,164
- Oh, I should go.
- It's too late for that now.

178
00:22:20,844 --> 00:22:23,284
I'm such a terrible faun.

179
00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:28,984
Oh, no.

180
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:31,814
You're the nicest faun I've ever met.

181
00:22:31,924 --> 00:22:35,484
Then I'm afraid you've had
a very poor sampling.

182
00:22:35,594 --> 00:22:40,084
No. You can't have done
anything that bad.

183
00:22:42,064 --> 00:22:46,304
It's not something I have done,
Lucy Pevensie.

184
00:22:46,904 --> 00:22:48,994
It's something I am doing.

185
00:22:49,104 --> 00:22:50,804
What are you doing?

186
00:22:51,614 --> 00:22:55,204
I'm kidnapping you.

187
00:22:55,314 --> 00:22:57,004
It was the White Witch.

188
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:59,604
She's the one who makes it
always winter, always cold.

189
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:01,244
She gave orders.

190
00:23:01,354 --> 00:23:04,652
If any of us ever find a human
wandering in the woods,

191
00:23:04,752 --> 00:23:07,082
we're supposed to turn it over to her.

192
00:23:07,892 --> 00:23:10,762
But, Mr. Tumnus, you wouldn't.

193
00:23:15,732 --> 00:23:18,822
I thought you were my friend.

194
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:26,232
Now. She may already know you're here.

195
00:23:26,342 --> 00:23:29,002
The woods are full of her spies.

196
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:34,552
Even some of the trees are on her side.

197
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:41,182
Can you find your way back from here?

198
00:23:41,292 --> 00:23:44,422
- I think so.
- All right.

199
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,500
Will you be all right?

200
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:55,430
Hey, hey, hey.

201
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,340
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

202
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,570
Here.

203
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,010
Keep it. You need it more than I do.

204
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,920
No matter what happens,
Lucy Pevensie,

205
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,460
I am glad to have met you.

206
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,620
You've made me feel warmer
than I've felt in a hundred years.

207
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,850
Now go.

208
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,490
Go!

209
00:24:35,338 --> 00:24:38,368
...99, 100.

210
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:39,808
Ready or not, here I come!

211
00:24:39,908 --> 00:24:43,148
It's all right! I'm back! I'm all right!

212
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:45,618
Shut up! He's coming!

213
00:24:49,388 --> 00:24:52,788
You know, I'm not sure you two
have quite got the idea of this game.

214
00:24:52,888 --> 00:24:55,378
Weren't you wondering where I was?

215
00:24:55,498 --> 00:24:58,658
That's the point.
That was why he was seeking you.

216
00:24:58,768 --> 00:25:00,098
Does this mean I win?

217
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,328
I don't think Lucy
wants to play anymore.

218
00:25:02,438 --> 00:25:04,898
I've been gone for hours.

219
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:22,276
Lucy, the only wood in here
is the back of the wardrobe.

220
00:25:22,386 --> 00:25:26,546
One game at a time, Lu.
We don't all have your imagination.

221
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:33,586
But I wasn't imagining!

222
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,396
That's enough, Lucy.

223
00:25:35,496 --> 00:25:37,896
I wouldn't lie about this!

224
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:39,696
Well, I believe you.

225
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:43,036
- You do?
- Yeah, of course.

226
00:25:43,136 --> 00:25:45,666
Didn't I tell you about
the field in the cupboards?

227
00:25:45,776 --> 00:25:47,906
Will you just stop?

228
00:25:48,016 --> 00:25:50,606
You just have to make
everything worse, don't you?

229
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,616
- It was just a joke!
- When are you gonna learn to grow up?

230
00:25:53,716 --> 00:25:56,986
Shut up! You think you're Dad,
but you're not!

231
00:26:00,556 --> 00:26:03,044
Well, that was nicely handled.

232
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:09,224
But... it really was there.

233
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:12,354
Susan's right, Lucy.

234
00:26:12,464 --> 00:26:14,364
That's enough.

235
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,990
Lucy.

236
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,890
Where are you?

237
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,860
Boo!

238
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,640
Lucy.

239
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,910
Hope you're not afraid of the dark.

240
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:19,578
Lucy?

241
00:28:25,228 --> 00:28:27,058
Lucy?

242
00:28:28,568 --> 00:28:30,118
Lucy!

243
00:28:48,648 --> 00:28:50,478
Lucy.

244
00:28:51,488 --> 00:28:53,388
Where are you?

245
00:28:55,058 --> 00:28:56,748
Lucy.

246
00:28:57,898 --> 00:29:00,298
I think I believe you now.

247
00:29:26,156 --> 00:29:27,776
Lucy.

248
00:29:44,706 --> 00:29:45,896
Lucy?

249
00:29:52,574 --> 00:29:53,804
Oh!

250
00:30:15,404 --> 00:30:17,964
- Leave me alone!
- What is it now, Ginarrbrik?

251
00:30:18,074 --> 00:30:20,304
Make him let me go!
I didn't do anything wrong!

252
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:22,774
How dare you address
the Queen of Narnia?

253
00:30:22,874 --> 00:30:24,704
I didn't know!

254
00:30:24,814 --> 00:30:27,834
- You will know her better hereafter!
- Wait!

255
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:41,482
What is your name, Son of Adam?

256
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:43,822
Uh, Edmund.

257
00:30:43,922 --> 00:30:47,992
And how, Edmund,
did you come to enter my dominion?

258
00:30:48,102 --> 00:30:52,052
I'm not sure.
I was just following my sister.

259
00:30:52,172 --> 00:30:55,802
- Your sister? How many are you?
- Four.

260
00:30:55,902 --> 00:30:58,632
Lucy's the only one
that's been here before.

261
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:02,642
She said she met some faun
called Tumnus.

262
00:31:02,742 --> 00:31:05,772
Peter and Susan didn't believe her.
I didn't either.

263
00:31:05,882 --> 00:31:10,542
Edmund, you look so cold.
Will you come and sit with me?

264
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,400
Now, how about something hot to drink?

265
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:34,300
Yes, please, Your Majesty.

266
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:54,090
Your drink, sire.

267
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,290
How did you do that?

268
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,420
I can make anything you like.

269
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,890
Can you make me taller?

270
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,988
Anything you'd like to eat.

271
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:08,668
Turkish delight?

272
00:32:34,198 --> 00:32:35,928
Edmund?

273
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:39,268
I would very much like to meet
the rest of your family.

274
00:32:39,368 --> 00:32:41,308
Why?

275
00:32:41,908 --> 00:32:44,278
They're nothing special.

276
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:50,306
Oh, I'm sure they're not nearly
as delightful as you are.

277
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:55,906
But you see, Edmund,
I have no children of my own.

278
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,956
And you are exactly the sort of boy

279
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:03,356
who I could see, one day,
becoming Prince of Narnia.

280
00:33:03,726 --> 00:33:05,986
Maybe even King.

281
00:33:07,126 --> 00:33:09,066
Really?

282
00:33:09,836 --> 00:33:12,326
Of course, you'd have
to bring your family.

283
00:33:12,436 --> 00:33:13,696
Oh.

284
00:33:13,806 --> 00:33:17,236
Do you mean,
Peter would be king too?

285
00:33:17,336 --> 00:33:19,896
No! No, no.

286
00:33:20,676 --> 00:33:23,706
But a king needs servants.

287
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:27,416
I guess I could bring 'em.

288
00:33:31,786 --> 00:33:34,884
Beyond these woods,
you see those two hills?

289
00:33:34,994 --> 00:33:38,114
My house is right between them.

290
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,164
You'd love it there, Edmund.

291
00:33:40,264 --> 00:33:44,564
It has whole rooms
simply stuffed with Turkish delight.

292
00:33:44,664 --> 00:33:47,894
- Couldn't I have some more now?
- No!

293
00:33:50,534 --> 00:33:52,834
Don't want to ruin your appetite.

294
00:33:52,944 --> 00:33:56,574
Besides, you and I are going to be
seeing each other again very soon.

295
00:33:56,674 --> 00:33:59,804
I hope so, Your Majesty.

296
00:34:00,684 --> 00:34:05,084
Until then, dear one.
Mmm, I'm gonna miss you.

297
00:34:06,884 --> 00:34:10,294
Yah! Yah! Yah!

298
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,462
Edmund?

299
00:34:20,702 --> 00:34:23,462
Oh, Edmund! You got in too!

300
00:34:23,572 --> 00:34:26,202
Isn't it wonderful?

301
00:34:26,302 --> 00:34:30,502
- Where have you been?
- With Mr. Tumnus. He's fine.

302
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:34,442
The White Witch hasn't found out
anything about him meeting me.

303
00:34:34,552 --> 00:34:35,912
The White Witch?

304
00:34:36,752 --> 00:34:40,652
She calls herself the Queen of Narnia,
but she really isn't.

305
00:34:42,292 --> 00:34:45,412
Are you all right? You look awful.

306
00:34:45,522 --> 00:34:49,422
Well, what'd you expect?
I mean, it's freezing.

307
00:34:49,532 --> 00:34:53,162
- How do we get out of here?
- Come on.

308
00:34:53,262 --> 00:34:54,862
This way.

309
00:34:57,072 --> 00:34:59,542
Peter, Peter, wake up!
Peter, wake up!

310
00:34:59,642 --> 00:35:01,502
- It's there! It's really there!
- Shh.

311
00:35:01,612 --> 00:35:04,440
- Lucy, what are you talking about?
- Narnia!

312
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:06,870
It's all in the wardrobe
like I told you!

313
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,040
- You've just been dreaming, Lucy.
- But I haven't!

314
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:14,110
I saw Mr. Tumnus again!
And this time Edmund went too.

315
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,590
You... You saw the faun?

316
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:27,390
Well, he didn't actually
go there with me.

317
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,360
He...

318
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,460
What were you doing, Edmund?

319
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,100
I was just playing along.

320
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,810
I'm sorry, Peter.

321
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:45,310
I shouldn't have encouraged her,

322
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,318
but you know what little children
are like these days.

323
00:35:48,418 --> 00:35:52,008
They just don't know
when to stop pretending.

324
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:00,488
Ow!

325
00:36:01,398 --> 00:36:04,198
Oh!

326
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:13,498
You children are one shenanigan
shy of sleepin' in the stable!

327
00:36:14,608 --> 00:36:20,548
Professor. I'm sorry. I told them
you were not to be disturbed.

328
00:36:20,648 --> 00:36:23,948
It's all right, Mrs. Macready.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

329
00:36:25,258 --> 00:36:28,518
But first of all, I think this one
is in need of a little hot chocolate.

330
00:36:28,628 --> 00:36:31,918
Come along, dear.

331
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:43,656
You seem to have upset the delicate
internal balance of my housekeeper.

332
00:36:43,766 --> 00:36:46,566
We're very sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

333
00:36:46,676 --> 00:36:49,036
It's our sister, sir. Lucy.

334
00:36:49,146 --> 00:36:52,206
- The weeping girl.
- Yes, sir.

335
00:36:52,316 --> 00:36:55,246
- She's upset.
- Hence the weeping.

336
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,746
It's nothing.

337
00:36:56,846 --> 00:36:59,716
- We can handle it.
- Oh, I can see that.

338
00:37:01,626 --> 00:37:04,316
She thinks she's found a magical land.

339
00:37:04,426 --> 00:37:07,256
In the upstairs wardrobe.

340
00:37:09,266 --> 00:37:10,956
What did you say?

341
00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:15,326
Um, the wardrobe, upstairs.

342
00:37:15,436 --> 00:37:17,866
Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside.

343
00:37:17,966 --> 00:37:20,134
She won't stop going on about it.

344
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:24,604
- What was it like?
- Like talking to a lunatic.

345
00:37:24,714 --> 00:37:27,174
No, no, no, not her.
The forest.

346
00:37:27,274 --> 00:37:30,714
- You're not saying you believe her?
- You don't?

347
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:32,244
But of course not.

348
00:37:32,354 --> 00:37:34,844
I mean, logically, it's impossible.

349
00:37:34,954 --> 00:37:37,784
What do they teach in schools
these days?

350
00:37:37,884 --> 00:37:39,784
Edmund said they were only pretending.

351
00:37:39,894 --> 00:37:41,914
He's usually the more
truthful one, is he?

352
00:37:42,024 --> 00:37:45,894
No. This would be the first time.

353
00:37:45,994 --> 00:37:48,054
Well, if she's not mad
and she's not lying,

354
00:37:48,164 --> 00:37:52,664
then logically we must assume
she's telling the truth.

355
00:37:53,134 --> 00:37:56,304
You're saying that we
should just believe her?

356
00:37:57,874 --> 00:38:01,934
She's your sister, isn't she?
You're her family.

357
00:38:04,112 --> 00:38:06,912
You might just try acting like one.

358
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:11,472
Peter winds up,
poised to take yet another wicket!

359
00:38:11,592 --> 00:38:13,212
Ow!

360
00:38:13,322 --> 00:38:17,122
Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream.

361
00:38:17,992 --> 00:38:20,122
Why can't we play hide and seek again?

362
00:38:20,232 --> 00:38:22,822
I thought you said it was a kid's game.

363
00:38:22,932 --> 00:38:27,302
Besides, we could all use the fresh air.

364
00:38:27,402 --> 00:38:30,102
It's not like there isn't air inside.

365
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:34,872
- Are you ready?
- Are you?

366
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,460
- Well done, Ed.
- You bowled it!

367
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,460
- What on earth is goin' on?
- The Macready!

368
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,160
Come on!

369
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,640
No, no, back, back, back!

370
00:39:34,128 --> 00:39:37,928
- Come on!
- Oh, you've got to be joking.

371
00:39:50,248 --> 00:39:51,378
Get back!

372
00:39:51,448 --> 00:39:54,388
- My toe!
- I'm not on your toe!

373
00:39:54,488 --> 00:39:57,288
- Move back.
- Will you stop shoving?

374
00:40:09,038 --> 00:40:12,228
Impossible.

375
00:40:14,438 --> 00:40:15,868
Don't worry.

376
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:19,426
I'm sure it's just your imagination.

377
00:40:19,546 --> 00:40:22,666
I don't suppose
saying we're sorry

378
00:40:22,776 --> 00:40:26,046
- would quite cover it.
- No. It wouldn't.

379
00:40:28,856 --> 00:40:31,086
- But that might!
- Oh!

380
00:40:33,756 --> 00:40:36,226
Oh!

381
00:40:38,726 --> 00:40:40,256
Ow!

382
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:42,896
Stop it!

383
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:45,966
You little liar.

384
00:40:46,066 --> 00:40:50,266
- You didn't believe her, either.
- Apologize to Lucy.

385
00:40:51,646 --> 00:40:55,336
- Say you're sorry.
- All right! I'm sorry.

386
00:40:55,446 --> 00:40:57,376
That's all right.

387
00:40:57,476 --> 00:41:00,446
Some children just don't know
when to stop pretending.

388
00:41:00,546 --> 00:41:01,986
Oh, very funny.

389
00:41:02,086 --> 00:41:03,914
Maybe we should go back.

390
00:41:04,014 --> 00:41:07,474
But shouldn't we at least
take a look around?

391
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,284
I think Lucy should decide.

392
00:41:10,894 --> 00:41:14,054
I'd like you all to meet Mr. Tumnus!

393
00:41:14,164 --> 00:41:16,324
Well, then Mr. Tumnus it is.

394
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:20,764
But we can't go hiking in the snow
dressed like this.

395
00:41:20,864 --> 00:41:21,834
No.

396
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:27,404
But I'm sure the professor
wouldn't mind us using these.

397
00:41:27,504 --> 00:41:31,804
Anyway, if you think about it logically,

398
00:41:31,914 --> 00:41:34,274
we're not even taking them
out of the wardrobe.

399
00:41:34,384 --> 00:41:37,514
- But that's a girl's coat!
- I know.

400
00:42:21,732 --> 00:42:25,822
...lots and lots of lovely food,
and we'll have lots and lots of...

401
00:42:28,932 --> 00:42:30,332
Lu?

402
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:33,670
Lucy!

403
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,350
Who would do something like this?

404
00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:15,010
"The Faun Tumnus is hereby charged

405
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:19,168
with High Treason
against Her lmperial Majesty,

406
00:43:19,278 --> 00:43:22,218
Jadis, Queen of Narnia,

407
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:25,578
for comforting her enemies
and fraternizing with humans.

408
00:43:25,688 --> 00:43:29,128
Signed Maugrim,
Captain of the Secret Police.

409
00:43:29,228 --> 00:43:31,318
Long Live the Queen."

410
00:43:32,628 --> 00:43:35,828
All right.
Now we really should go back.

411
00:43:35,928 --> 00:43:37,558
But what about Mr. Tumnus?

412
00:43:37,668 --> 00:43:40,498
If he was arrested just
for being with a human,

413
00:43:40,598 --> 00:43:44,468
- I don't think there's much we can do.
- You don't understand, do you?

414
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,798
I'm the human.

415
00:43:47,908 --> 00:43:50,308
She must have found out
he helped me.

416
00:43:50,408 --> 00:43:53,938
- Maybe we could call the police.
- These are the police.

417
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,248
Don't worry, Lu.
We'll think of something.

418
00:43:56,348 --> 00:43:58,178
Why?

419
00:43:58,858 --> 00:44:00,448
I mean, he's a criminal.

420
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:03,258
Psst.

421
00:44:05,526 --> 00:44:08,756
Did that bird just "psst" us?

422
00:44:51,364 --> 00:44:54,494
It... It's a beaver.

423
00:45:00,444 --> 00:45:02,434
Here, boy.

424
00:45:02,544 --> 00:45:04,514
Here, boy.

425
00:45:08,384 --> 00:45:11,714
I ain't gonna smell it,
if that's what you want.

426
00:45:11,824 --> 00:45:13,124
Oh.

427
00:45:13,224 --> 00:45:14,554
Sorry.

428
00:45:14,924 --> 00:45:17,554
Lucy Pevensie?

429
00:45:22,164 --> 00:45:23,724
Yes?

430
00:45:33,114 --> 00:45:35,302
Hey, that's the hankie
I gave to Mr. Tum...

431
00:45:35,412 --> 00:45:38,472
Tumnus. He got it to me
just before they took him.

432
00:45:38,582 --> 00:45:39,942
Is he all right?

433
00:45:40,812 --> 00:45:42,752
Further in.

434
00:45:44,682 --> 00:45:47,552
- What are you doing?
- She's right.

435
00:45:47,652 --> 00:45:50,212
How do we know we can trust him?

436
00:45:50,322 --> 00:45:52,022
He said he knows the faun.

437
00:45:52,132 --> 00:45:56,082
He's a beaver.
He shouldn't be saying anything!

438
00:45:56,202 --> 00:45:57,892
Everything all right?

439
00:45:58,002 --> 00:46:00,262
Yes. We were just talking.

440
00:46:00,372 --> 00:46:03,392
That's better left
for safer quarters.

441
00:46:04,502 --> 00:46:06,602
He means the trees.

442
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:25,490
Come on. We don't want to be
caught out here after nightfall.

443
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:42,200
Ah, blimey! Looks like the old girl
has got the kettle on.

444
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:43,970
Nice cup o' Rosy Lee.

445
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,740
- It's lovely.
- It's merely a trifle.

446
00:46:46,850 --> 00:46:49,140
Still plenty to do.
Ain't quite finished it yet.

447
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,150
It'll look the business
when it is, though.

448
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:56,050
Beaver, is that you?
I've been worried sick!

449
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,850
If I find you've been
out with Badger again, I...

450
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,990
Oh!

451
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:03,360
Well, those aren't badgers.

452
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:08,088
Oh, I never thought
I'd live to see this day.

453
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:12,398
Look at my fur. You couldn't
give me ten minutes warning?

454
00:47:12,508 --> 00:47:15,028
I'd have given a week
if I thought it would've helped.

455
00:47:15,138 --> 00:47:17,108
Oh, come inside,

456
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:19,368
and we'll see if we
can't get you some food,

457
00:47:19,478 --> 00:47:23,878
and some civilized company.

458
00:47:23,978 --> 00:47:26,248
Now, careful. Watch your step.

459
00:47:26,348 --> 00:47:27,908
Excuse the mess.

460
00:47:28,018 --> 00:47:31,048
Can't get Mr. Beaver
to get out of his chair.

461
00:47:35,298 --> 00:47:37,858
Enjoyin' the scenery, are we?

462
00:47:41,668 --> 00:47:44,358
Isn't there anything
we can do to help Tumnus?

463
00:47:44,468 --> 00:47:47,528
They'll have taken him to the Witch's.
You know what they say.

464
00:47:47,638 --> 00:47:51,466
There's few that go through
them gates that come out again.

465
00:47:51,576 --> 00:47:54,046
Fish 'n' chips?

466
00:47:54,676 --> 00:47:58,276
But there is hope, dear.
Lots of hope.

467
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:01,746
Oh, yeah,
there's a right bit more than hope!

468
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:05,586
Aslan is on the move.

469
00:48:12,626 --> 00:48:13,856
Who's Aslan?

470
00:48:13,966 --> 00:48:16,826
Who's Aslan?

471
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,906
You cheeky little blighter.

472
00:48:21,636 --> 00:48:22,896
What?

473
00:48:25,476 --> 00:48:28,906
- You don't know, do you?
- We haven't exactly been here long.

474
00:48:29,016 --> 00:48:31,376
Well, he's only the king
of the whole wood.

475
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:35,004
The top geezer.
The real King of Narnia.

476
00:48:35,114 --> 00:48:39,014
- He's been away for a long while.
- But he's just got back!

477
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,884
And he's waitin' for you
near the Stone Table!

478
00:48:41,994 --> 00:48:45,014
- He's waiting for us?
- You're bloomin' joking!

479
00:48:45,124 --> 00:48:47,684
They don't even know about the prophecy!

480
00:48:47,794 --> 00:48:51,594
- Well, then...
- Look.

481
00:48:51,694 --> 00:48:53,864
Aslan's return,

482
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:57,234
Tumnus' arrest, the secret police,

483
00:48:57,334 --> 00:48:59,434
it's all happening because of you!

484
00:48:59,544 --> 00:49:02,904
- You're blaming us?
- No! Not blaming.

485
00:49:03,014 --> 00:49:06,844
- Thanking you.
- There's a prophecy.

486
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,814
"When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone

487
00:49:09,914 --> 00:49:12,944
sits at Cair Paravel in throne,

488
00:49:13,054 --> 00:49:15,684
the evil time will be over and done."

489
00:49:15,794 --> 00:49:18,084
- That doesn't really rhyme.
- I know it don't.

490
00:49:18,194 --> 00:49:20,452
You're kinda missin' the point!

491
00:49:20,562 --> 00:49:22,962
It has long been foretold

492
00:49:23,062 --> 00:49:25,762
that two Sons of Adam
and two Daughters of Eve

493
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:31,102
will defeat the White Witch
and restore peace to Narnia.

494
00:49:33,502 --> 00:49:34,992
And you think we're the ones?

495
00:49:35,102 --> 00:49:38,102
You'd better be, 'cause Aslan's
already fitted out your army.

496
00:49:38,212 --> 00:49:40,142
- Our army?
- Mum sent us away

497
00:49:40,242 --> 00:49:43,082
so we wouldn't get
caught up in a war.

498
00:49:43,882 --> 00:49:46,642
I think you've made a mistake.

499
00:49:46,752 --> 00:49:49,622
- We're not heroes.
- We're from Finchley.

500
00:49:50,692 --> 00:49:51,782
Hmm.

501
00:49:51,892 --> 00:49:54,952
Thank you for your hospitality.

502
00:49:55,962 --> 00:49:59,552
- But we really have to go.
- No, you can't just leave!

503
00:49:59,662 --> 00:50:03,292
He's right.
We have to help Mr. Tumnus.

504
00:50:03,402 --> 00:50:05,890
It's out of our hands.

505
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,400
I'm sorry,

506
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,700
but it's time the four of us
were getting home. Ed?

507
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,940
Ed?

508
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:20,350
- I'm gonna kill him.
- You may not have to.

509
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:23,440
Has Edmund ever been to Narnia before?

510
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:51,508
Hurry!

511
00:51:11,928 --> 00:51:14,528
- Edmund!
- Shh! They'll hear you!

512
00:51:15,738 --> 00:51:16,858
No!

513
00:51:16,968 --> 00:51:19,368
- Get off!
- You're playing into her hands.

514
00:51:19,478 --> 00:51:21,878
- We can't just let him go!
- He's our brother!

515
00:51:21,978 --> 00:51:24,998
He's the bait!
The Witch wants all four of you!

516
00:51:25,108 --> 00:51:28,978
- Why?
- To stop the prophecy from coming true.

517
00:51:29,088 --> 00:51:30,448
To kill you!

518
00:51:40,456 --> 00:51:43,686
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

519
00:51:43,796 --> 00:51:46,826
None of this would have happened
if you had listened to me!

520
00:51:46,936 --> 00:51:49,126
- You knew this would happen.
- I didn't know.

521
00:51:49,236 --> 00:51:51,826
Which is why we should
have left while we could!

522
00:51:51,936 --> 00:51:52,926
Stop it!

523
00:51:54,106 --> 00:51:57,836
- This isn't going to help Edmund.
- She's right.

524
00:51:57,946 --> 00:52:01,076
Only Aslan can help your brother now.

525
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,376
Then take us to him.

526
00:53:14,512 --> 00:53:17,512
Be still, stranger,
or you'll never move again.

527
00:53:18,082 --> 00:53:19,712
- Who are you?
- I'm Edmund!

528
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:23,412
I met the Queen in the woods!
She told me to come back here!

529
00:53:23,522 --> 00:53:24,962
I'm a Son of Adam!

530
00:53:25,062 --> 00:53:30,052
Hmm. My apologies,
fortunate favorite of the queen.

531
00:53:30,162 --> 00:53:33,462
Or else, not so fortunate.

532
00:53:37,772 --> 00:53:39,572
Right this way.

533
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:02,490
Wait here.

534
00:54:41,798 --> 00:54:42,928
Like it?

535
00:54:43,038 --> 00:54:47,938
Uh... Yes, Your Majesty.

536
00:54:50,408 --> 00:54:52,498
I thought you might.

537
00:54:54,578 --> 00:54:56,278
Tell me, Edmund...

538
00:54:59,048 --> 00:55:01,078
Are your sisters deaf?

539
00:55:01,188 --> 00:55:02,848
No.

540
00:55:02,958 --> 00:55:05,788
And your brother, is he...

541
00:55:07,688 --> 00:55:09,588
...unintelligent?

542
00:55:09,698 --> 00:55:12,098
Well, I think so.
But Mum says...

543
00:55:12,198 --> 00:55:16,288
Then how dare you come alone?!

544
00:55:16,398 --> 00:55:19,098
- I tried!
- Edmund, I asked so little of you.

545
00:55:19,206 --> 00:55:22,066
- They just don't listen to me!
- You couldn't even do that.

546
00:55:22,166 --> 00:55:23,636
I did bring them halfway.

547
00:55:23,736 --> 00:55:26,406
They're at the little house at the dam
with the Beavers.

548
00:55:33,616 --> 00:55:35,516
Well.

549
00:55:35,616 --> 00:55:39,516
I suppose you're not
a total loss then, are you?

550
00:55:42,286 --> 00:55:44,186
Well, I was wondering,

551
00:55:45,196 --> 00:55:50,226
could I maybe have some more
Turkish delight now?

552
00:55:55,776 --> 00:55:57,826
Our guest is hungry.

553
00:56:04,514 --> 00:56:07,974
This way for your num-nums.

554
00:56:10,114 --> 00:56:13,054
Maugrim?

555
00:56:15,024 --> 00:56:17,114
You know what to do.

556
00:56:43,314 --> 00:56:44,284
Hurry, Mother! They're after us!

557
00:56:45,954 --> 00:56:48,884
- Oh, right then.
- What's she doing?

558
00:56:49,622 --> 00:56:51,312
Oh, you'll be thanking me later.

559
00:56:51,422 --> 00:56:54,792
It's a long journey and Beaver
gets pretty cranky when he's hungry.

560
00:56:54,892 --> 00:56:56,382
I'm cranky now!

561
00:56:58,632 --> 00:56:59,892
Take them.

562
00:57:03,432 --> 00:57:06,892
- Do you think we'll need jam?
- Only if the Witch serves toast.

563
00:57:22,152 --> 00:57:23,142
Hurry.

564
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:42,070
Badger and me dug this.
Comes out right near his place.

565
00:57:42,170 --> 00:57:44,400
You told me
it led to your mum's!

566
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:46,470
Lucy!

567
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:49,580
They're in the tunnel.

568
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:52,670
- Quick! This way.
- Hurry!

569
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,080
- Run!
- Quick! Quick! Quick!

570
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:06,360
You should have brought a map!

571
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:09,160
There wasn't room next to the jam.

572
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,470
Come on, Lucy!

573
00:58:37,858 --> 00:58:41,158
I'm so sorry, dear.

574
00:58:41,258 --> 00:58:43,488
He was my best mate.

575
00:58:52,778 --> 00:58:53,998
What happened here?

576
00:58:54,108 --> 00:58:56,908
This is what becomes
of those who cross the Witch.

577
00:58:57,008 --> 00:59:00,738
You take one more step, traitor,
and I'll chew you to splinters!

578
00:59:00,848 --> 00:59:03,678
Relax. I'm one of the good guys.

579
00:59:03,788 --> 00:59:07,806
Yeah? Well, you look an awful lot
like one of the bad ones.

580
00:59:07,916 --> 00:59:10,216
An unfortunate family resemblance.

581
00:59:10,326 --> 00:59:13,516
But we can argue breeding later.
Right now we've got to move.

582
00:59:15,026 --> 00:59:17,016
What did you have in mind?

583
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:26,226
Greetings, gents.

584
00:59:27,036 --> 00:59:30,376
- Lost something, have we?
- Don't patronize me!

585
00:59:30,476 --> 00:59:33,136
I know where your allegiance lies.

586
00:59:33,246 --> 00:59:36,406
We're looking for some humans.

587
00:59:36,516 --> 00:59:38,816
Humans? Here in Narnia?

588
00:59:38,916 --> 00:59:41,686
That's a valuable bit of information,
don't you think?

589
00:59:43,626 --> 00:59:45,916
Your reward is your life.

590
00:59:46,026 --> 00:59:48,456
It's not much,

591
00:59:49,256 --> 00:59:50,694
but still.

592
00:59:51,364 --> 00:59:53,384
Where are the fugitives?

593
01:00:00,374 --> 01:00:03,344
North. They ran north.

594
01:00:04,274 --> 01:00:06,244
Smell them out.

595
01:00:16,554 --> 01:00:20,454
They were helping Tumnus.
The Witch got here before I did.

596
01:00:20,554 --> 01:00:23,154
Ow! Oh!

597
01:00:23,264 --> 01:00:24,654
Are you all right?

598
01:00:24,764 --> 01:00:27,894
Well, I wish I could say their bark
was worse than their bite. Ow!

599
01:00:27,994 --> 01:00:32,404
Stop squirming!
You're worse than Beaver on bath day.

600
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:33,974
Worst day of the year.

601
01:00:34,074 --> 01:00:36,562
Thank you for your kindness,

602
01:00:36,672 --> 01:00:38,762
but that's all the cure I have time for.

603
01:00:38,872 --> 01:00:39,842
You're leaving?

604
01:00:39,942 --> 01:00:43,502
It has been a pleasure, My Queen,
and an honor, but time is short

605
01:00:43,612 --> 01:00:46,742
and Aslan himself has asked me
to gather more troops.

606
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:50,652
- You've seen Aslan?
- What's he like?

607
01:00:50,752 --> 01:00:53,812
Like everything we've ever heard.

608
01:00:53,922 --> 01:00:57,412
You'll be glad to have him by your side
in the battle against the Witch.

609
01:00:57,522 --> 01:01:00,292
But we're not planning
on fighting any witch.

610
01:01:00,392 --> 01:01:03,162
But surely, King Peter, the prophecy!

611
01:01:03,262 --> 01:01:05,392
We can't go to war without you.

612
01:01:10,942 --> 01:01:13,202
We just want our brother back.

613
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:39,660
If...

614
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:44,140
If you're not going to eat that...

615
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,600
I'd get up, but...

616
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,940
...but my legs.

617
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:07,288
Mr. Tumnus.

618
01:02:08,858 --> 01:02:10,798
What's left of him.

619
01:02:17,298 --> 01:02:21,138
- You're Lucy Pevensie's brother.
- I'm Edmund.

620
01:02:22,308 --> 01:02:25,538
Yes. Yes, you have the same nose.

621
01:02:30,048 --> 01:02:31,778
Is your sister all right?

622
01:02:34,388 --> 01:02:35,908
Is she safe?

623
01:02:39,828 --> 01:02:41,848
I don't know.

624
01:02:48,998 --> 01:02:52,526
My police tore that dam apart.

625
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:56,996
Your little family
are nowhere to be found.

626
01:03:01,076 --> 01:03:03,946
- Where did they go?
- I don't know!

627
01:03:04,716 --> 01:03:07,306
Then you're of no further use to me.

628
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:11,746
Wait! The beaver
said something about Aslan!

629
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:17,656
Aslan?

630
01:03:19,026 --> 01:03:20,016
Where?

631
01:03:22,696 --> 01:03:25,426
- I...
- He's a stranger here, Your Majesty.

632
01:03:25,536 --> 01:03:27,466
He can't be expected
to know anything.

633
01:03:29,436 --> 01:03:33,276
I said... where is Aslan?

634
01:03:37,674 --> 01:03:39,804
I... I don't know.

635
01:03:39,914 --> 01:03:42,274
I left before they said anything.

636
01:03:44,784 --> 01:03:47,114
I wanted to see you!

637
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:51,214
Guard!

638
01:03:51,854 --> 01:03:53,624
Your Majesty.

639
01:03:55,864 --> 01:03:58,664
Release the faun.

640
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:01,954
Ah! Ah!

641
01:04:11,244 --> 01:04:13,234
Do you know why you're here, faun?

642
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:19,812
Because I believe in a free Narnia.

643
01:04:20,852 --> 01:04:23,112
You're here...

644
01:04:23,222 --> 01:04:26,682
...because he turned you in.

645
01:04:28,492 --> 01:04:29,962
For sweeties.

646
01:04:37,832 --> 01:04:39,662
Take him upstairs.

647
01:04:45,412 --> 01:04:48,042
And ready my sleigh.

648
01:04:48,142 --> 01:04:50,772
Edmund misses his family.

649
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:16,690
Now, Aslan's camp
is near the Stone Table

650
01:05:16,810 --> 01:05:20,330
- just across the frozen river.
- River?

651
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:24,400
The river's been frozen solid
for a hundred years.

652
01:05:27,550 --> 01:05:30,950
- It's so far.
- It's the world, dear.

653
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:32,880
Did you expect it to be small?

654
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:36,090
Smaller.

655
01:05:52,908 --> 01:05:55,898
When you're ready, Son of Adam.

656
01:06:03,548 --> 01:06:05,988
Yah! Yah! Yah!

657
01:06:31,208 --> 01:06:34,976
Come on, humans!
While we're still young.

658
01:06:35,716 --> 01:06:38,476
If he tells us to hurry one more time,

659
01:06:38,586 --> 01:06:42,346
I'm gonna turn him
into a big, fluffy hat.

660
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:44,756
Hurry up! Come on!

661
01:06:44,856 --> 01:06:48,556
- He is getting a little bossy.
- Behind you! It's her!

662
01:06:48,656 --> 01:06:50,526
- Run! Run!
- Run!

663
01:07:15,756 --> 01:07:17,016
Hurry!

664
01:07:19,854 --> 01:07:21,484
Inside!

665
01:07:21,594 --> 01:07:23,424
Dive! Dive!

666
01:07:25,924 --> 01:07:28,054
Quick! Quick, quick, quick!

667
01:07:56,354 --> 01:07:58,794
Maybe she's gone.

668
01:07:59,724 --> 01:08:02,194
- I suppose I'll go look.
- No!

669
01:08:02,294 --> 01:08:04,854
You're worth nothing to Narnia dead.

670
01:08:04,962 --> 01:08:06,932
Well, neither are you, Beaver.

671
01:08:07,032 --> 01:08:09,192
Thanks, sweetheart.

672
01:08:17,612 --> 01:08:21,202
- What's that? What's...
- Shh, shh, shh.

673
01:08:24,222 --> 01:08:25,952
Come out! Come out!

674
01:08:26,052 --> 01:08:29,212
I hope you've all been good
'cause there's someone here to see you!

675
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:52,940
Merry Christmas, sir.

676
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,040
It certainly is, Lucy,
since you have arrived.

677
01:08:57,150 --> 01:09:01,180
Look, I've put up with a lot
since I got here, but this...

678
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:04,720
- We thought you were the Witch.
- Yes, yes, I'm sorry about that,

679
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:10,280
but in my defense, I have been driving
one of these longer than the Witch.

680
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:13,490
I thought there was
no Christmas in Narnia.

681
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,120
No. For a long time.

682
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:20,530
But the hope that you have brought,
Your Majesties,

683
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:24,470
is finally starting
to weaken the Witch's power.

684
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:28,770
Still, I dare say
you could do with these.

685
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,610
Presents!

686
01:09:40,158 --> 01:09:42,458
The juice of the fire-flower.

687
01:09:42,558 --> 01:09:46,658
One drop will cure any injury.

688
01:09:48,228 --> 01:09:50,788
And though I hope
you never have to use it...

689
01:09:53,908 --> 01:09:55,768
Thank you, sir,

690
01:09:55,868 --> 01:09:59,278
but I think I could be brave enough.

691
01:09:59,378 --> 01:10:02,038
I'm sure you could.

692
01:10:02,148 --> 01:10:05,578
But battles are ugly affairs.

693
01:10:12,218 --> 01:10:13,988
Susan.

694
01:10:16,458 --> 01:10:21,256
Trust in this bow
and it will not easily miss.

695
01:10:22,426 --> 01:10:24,986
What happened
to "battles are ugly affairs"?

696
01:10:27,306 --> 01:10:30,466
Though you don't seem to have
a problem making yourself heard,

697
01:10:30,576 --> 01:10:34,406
blow on this
and wherever you are,

698
01:10:34,506 --> 01:10:36,706
help will come.

699
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,606
Thanks.

700
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:42,276
Peter.

701
01:10:43,516 --> 01:10:47,356
The time to use these
may be near at hand.

702
01:10:55,066 --> 01:10:56,226
Thank you, sir.

703
01:10:57,036 --> 01:11:00,836
These are tools, not toys.

704
01:11:00,936 --> 01:11:03,126
Bear them well and wisely.

705
01:11:04,876 --> 01:11:07,534
Now, I must be off.

706
01:11:07,644 --> 01:11:10,164
Winter is almost over,

707
01:11:10,274 --> 01:11:14,684
and things do pile up
when you've been gone a hundred years.

708
01:11:18,084 --> 01:11:20,214
Long live Aslan!

709
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:24,644
And Merry Christmas!

710
01:11:27,124 --> 01:11:29,684
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

711
01:11:29,794 --> 01:11:33,094
- See you next year!
- Goodbye!

712
01:11:33,194 --> 01:11:35,224
Told you he was real.

713
01:11:35,634 --> 01:11:40,404
He said winter was almost over.

714
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:42,534
You know what that means.

715
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:46,544
No more ice.

716
01:11:56,722 --> 01:11:59,982
- We need to cross, now!
- Don't beavers make dams?

717
01:12:00,092 --> 01:12:02,282
- I'm not that fast, dear.
- Come on!

718
01:12:02,392 --> 01:12:04,622
Wait! Will you think
about this for a minute?

719
01:12:04,732 --> 01:12:07,492
- We don't have a minute.
- I'm just trying to be realistic.

720
01:12:07,602 --> 01:12:11,052
No, you're trying to be smart.
As usual.

721
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,030
Wait. Maybe I should go first.

722
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,900
Maybe you should.

723
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,810
You've been sneaking
second helpings, haven't you?

724
01:12:59,910 --> 01:13:02,410
Well, you never know
which meal's gonna be your last.

725
01:13:02,550 --> 01:13:05,820
Especially with your cooking.

726
01:13:24,368 --> 01:13:26,308
If Mum knew what we were doing...

727
01:13:26,408 --> 01:13:27,768
Mum's not here.

728
01:13:29,808 --> 01:13:31,938
Oh, no!

729
01:13:32,048 --> 01:13:33,408
Run!

730
01:13:36,848 --> 01:13:38,278
Hurry!

731
01:13:48,528 --> 01:13:49,958
No!

732
01:13:50,098 --> 01:13:51,288
Peter!

733
01:13:51,998 --> 01:13:53,828
Put that down, boy.

734
01:13:54,538 --> 01:13:57,768
- Someone could get hurt.
- Don't worry about me!

735
01:13:57,868 --> 01:13:59,198
Run him through!

736
01:13:59,308 --> 01:14:02,968
Leave now while you can,
and your brother leaves with you.

737
01:14:03,078 --> 01:14:06,006
Stop, Peter!
Maybe we should listen to him!

738
01:14:06,106 --> 01:14:07,736
Smart girl.

739
01:14:07,846 --> 01:14:11,076
Don't listen to him!
Kill him! Kill him now!

740
01:14:11,186 --> 01:14:14,446
Oh, come on. This isn't your war.

741
01:14:14,556 --> 01:14:17,986
All my Queen wants is for you
to take your family and go.

742
01:14:18,126 --> 01:14:20,886
Look, just because some man
in a red coat hands you a sword,

743
01:14:20,996 --> 01:14:24,486
it doesn't make you a hero!
Just drop it!

744
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:27,186
No, Peter!
Narnia needs you!

745
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:29,566
Gut him while you still have a chance!

746
01:14:29,666 --> 01:14:33,726
What's it gonna be, Son of Adam?
I won't wait forever.

747
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:35,536
And neither will the river.

748
01:14:37,476 --> 01:14:38,666
Peter!

749
01:14:46,486 --> 01:14:47,816
Hold onto me!

750
01:15:47,812 --> 01:15:50,242
Lovely.

751
01:15:58,652 --> 01:16:00,642
What have you done?

752
01:16:03,122 --> 01:16:05,112
Lucy!

753
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:08,422
Lucy!

754
01:16:12,762 --> 01:16:14,892
Has anyone seen my coat?

755
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,440
Don't you worry, dear.

756
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:26,770
Your brother's got you
well looked after.

757
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,580
And I don't think you'll be
needing those coats anymore.

758
01:17:05,548 --> 01:17:09,038
It's so warm out.

759
01:17:12,188 --> 01:17:15,058
I'll go and check the sleigh.

760
01:17:16,888 --> 01:17:18,488
Your Majesty.

761
01:17:18,598 --> 01:17:20,288
We found the traitor.

762
01:17:20,398 --> 01:17:22,698
He was rallying your enemies
near the Shuddering Woods.

763
01:17:23,898 --> 01:17:26,128
Ah. Nice of you to drop in.

764
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:28,668
You were so helpful
to my wolves last night.

765
01:17:29,138 --> 01:17:31,608
Perhaps you can help me now.

766
01:17:31,738 --> 01:17:35,578
- Forgive me, Your Majesty.
- Oh, don't waste time with flattery.

767
01:17:35,678 --> 01:17:40,138
Not to seem rude,
but I wasn't actually talking to you.

768
01:17:48,788 --> 01:17:51,226
Where are the humans headed?

769
01:17:55,226 --> 01:17:59,636
Wait! No! Don't. The beaver said
something about the Stone Table,

770
01:17:59,766 --> 01:18:01,566
and that Aslan had an army there.

771
01:18:03,466 --> 01:18:05,636
An army?

772
01:18:10,746 --> 01:18:12,766
Thank you, Edmund.

773
01:18:12,916 --> 01:18:16,346
I'm glad this creature
got to see some honesty...

774
01:18:17,716 --> 01:18:20,686
...before he dies.
- No!

775
01:18:31,196 --> 01:18:34,396
Think about whose side you're on,
Edmund.

776
01:18:34,506 --> 01:18:36,624
Mine...

777
01:18:38,634 --> 01:18:40,464
...or theirs.

778
01:18:45,974 --> 01:18:49,374
Go on ahead.
Gather the faithful.

779
01:18:49,784 --> 01:18:52,714
If it's a war Aslan wants...

780
01:18:54,484 --> 01:18:56,714
...it's a war he shall get.

781
01:19:57,982 --> 01:20:00,612
Why are they all staring at us?

782
01:20:00,722 --> 01:20:03,122
Maybe they think you look funny.

783
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:11,890
Oi, stop your fussing.
You look lovely.

784
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:32,400
We have come to see Aslan.

785
01:21:16,118 --> 01:21:19,518
Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam.

786
01:21:19,658 --> 01:21:23,528
Welcome, Susan and Lucy,
Daughters of Eve.

787
01:21:23,628 --> 01:21:27,158
And welcome to you, Beavers.
You have my thanks.

788
01:21:27,298 --> 01:21:30,238
But where is the fourth?

789
01:21:30,938 --> 01:21:33,868
That's why we're here, sir.

790
01:21:33,978 --> 01:21:35,408
We need your help.

791
01:21:35,508 --> 01:21:38,566
We had a little trouble along the way.

792
01:21:38,706 --> 01:21:41,006
Our brother's been captured
by the White Witch.

793
01:21:41,116 --> 01:21:43,946
Captured? How could this happen?

794
01:21:45,516 --> 01:21:49,916
He betrayed them, Your Majesty.

795
01:21:50,016 --> 01:21:53,786
- Then he has betrayed us all!
- Peace, Oreius.

796
01:21:53,896 --> 01:21:55,826
I'm sure there's an explanation.

797
01:21:58,826 --> 01:22:01,056
It's my fault, really.

798
01:22:02,436 --> 01:22:05,056
I was too hard on him.

799
01:22:08,576 --> 01:22:09,936
We all were.

800
01:22:10,906 --> 01:22:12,706
Sir, he's our brother.

801
01:22:12,806 --> 01:22:14,746
I know, dear one.

802
01:22:14,876 --> 01:22:18,606
But that only makes
the betrayal all the worse.

803
01:22:18,716 --> 01:22:21,744
This may be harder than you think.

804
01:22:28,654 --> 01:22:33,564
That is Cair Paravel,
the castle of the four thrones.

805
01:22:34,534 --> 01:22:38,864
In one of which you will sit, Peter,
as High King.

806
01:22:39,504 --> 01:22:41,904
You doubt the prophecy?

807
01:22:42,004 --> 01:22:45,404
No. That's just it.

808
01:22:46,904 --> 01:22:49,844
Aslan, I'm not what you all think I am.

809
01:22:49,944 --> 01:22:52,274
Peter Pevensie, formerly of Finchley.

810
01:22:53,544 --> 01:22:58,504
Beaver also mentioned that you
planned on turning him into a hat.

811
01:23:01,094 --> 01:23:04,544
Peter, there is a Deep Magic,

812
01:23:04,694 --> 01:23:06,322
more powerful than any of us,

813
01:23:06,422 --> 01:23:08,622
that rules over all of Narnia.

814
01:23:08,732 --> 01:23:11,222
It defines right from wrong,

815
01:23:11,362 --> 01:23:14,022
and governs all our destinies.

816
01:23:14,132 --> 01:23:17,122
Yours... and mine.

817
01:23:17,572 --> 01:23:19,662
But I couldn't even
protect my own family.

818
01:23:19,802 --> 01:23:22,272
You've brought them safely this far.

819
01:23:22,642 --> 01:23:24,472
Not all of them.

820
01:23:24,582 --> 01:23:28,882
Peter, I will do what I can
to help your brother,

821
01:23:28,982 --> 01:23:32,012
but I need you to consider
what I ask of you.

822
01:23:34,052 --> 01:23:36,492
I, too, want my family safe.

823
01:23:39,622 --> 01:23:43,622
Is our little prince uncomfortable?

824
01:23:43,762 --> 01:23:47,132
Does he want his pillow fluffed?

825
01:23:49,002 --> 01:23:53,490
Special treatment for the special boy!

826
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:57,170
Isn't that what you wanted?

827
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:01,740
You look like Mum.

828
01:24:01,850 --> 01:24:04,750
Mum hasn't had a dress like this
since before the war.

829
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:10,050
We should bring her one back.
A whole trunk full!

830
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:13,050
If we ever get back.

831
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:19,660
I'm sorry I'm like that.

832
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:24,370
We used to have fun together, didn't we?

833
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:28,770
Yes. Before you got boring.

834
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:30,270
Oh, really?

835
01:24:43,888 --> 01:24:45,288
Please don't try to run.

836
01:24:45,388 --> 01:24:49,218
- We're tired.
- And we prefer to kill you quickly.

837
01:24:53,128 --> 01:24:54,828
Susan!

838
01:25:05,108 --> 01:25:06,438
Get back!

839
01:25:07,478 --> 01:25:09,338
Peter! Ah!

840
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:12,508
Come on.

841
01:25:13,518 --> 01:25:16,448
We've already been through this before.

842
01:25:16,548 --> 01:25:19,048
We both know you haven't got it in you.

843
01:25:19,188 --> 01:25:20,916
Peter! Watch out!

844
01:25:29,996 --> 01:25:34,656
No! Stay your weapons.
This is Peter's battle.

845
01:25:36,206 --> 01:25:38,266
You may think you're a king,

846
01:25:38,406 --> 01:25:40,666
but you're going to die...

847
01:25:40,776 --> 01:25:42,966
...like a dog!
- Look out!

848
01:25:43,746 --> 01:25:45,336
Peter!

849
01:26:01,066 --> 01:26:03,996
After him.

850
01:26:05,366 --> 01:26:07,454
He'll lead you to Edmund.

851
01:26:11,734 --> 01:26:13,204
Peter.

852
01:26:14,004 --> 01:26:15,494
Clean your sword.

853
01:26:20,214 --> 01:26:24,804
Rise, Sir Peter Wolf's-Bane,

854
01:26:24,954 --> 01:26:27,714
Knight of Narnia.

855
01:26:53,812 --> 01:26:55,472
The minotaurs will take the left flanks.

856
01:26:55,582 --> 01:26:58,742
We'll keep the giants in reserve
and send the dwarfs in first.

857
01:27:05,022 --> 01:27:06,652
Ah!

858
01:27:07,822 --> 01:27:09,622
The prisoner!

859
01:27:38,390 --> 01:27:40,440
You're not
going to kill me?

860
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:45,560
Not yet.

861
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,090
We have work to do.

862
01:28:22,128 --> 01:28:24,028
Edmund!

863
01:28:55,998 --> 01:28:58,228
What's done is done.

864
01:28:58,328 --> 01:29:02,358
There is no need to speak to Edmund
about what is past.

865
01:29:11,276 --> 01:29:12,866
Hello.

866
01:29:26,926 --> 01:29:29,986
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little tired.

867
01:29:30,126 --> 01:29:32,386
Get some sleep.

868
01:29:40,406 --> 01:29:42,426
And Edmund...

869
01:29:44,676 --> 01:29:46,236
...try not to wander off.

870
01:29:59,684 --> 01:30:02,054
Narnia's not going
to run out of toast, Ed.

871
01:30:03,854 --> 01:30:07,194
I'm sure they'll pack something up
for the journey back.

872
01:30:07,294 --> 01:30:08,624
We're going home?

873
01:30:09,594 --> 01:30:11,654
You are.

874
01:30:12,434 --> 01:30:14,864
I promised Mum I'd keep you three safe.

875
01:30:15,804 --> 01:30:18,234
But it doesn't mean
I can't stay behind and help.

876
01:30:18,374 --> 01:30:20,744
But they need us.

877
01:30:21,914 --> 01:30:24,104
All four of us.

878
01:30:24,214 --> 01:30:26,074
Lucy, it's too dangerous.

879
01:30:26,184 --> 01:30:28,674
You almost drowned!
Edmund was almost killed!

880
01:30:29,484 --> 01:30:32,314
Which is why we have to stay.

881
01:30:34,054 --> 01:30:38,782
I've seen what the White Witch can do.
And I've helped her do it.

882
01:30:40,222 --> 01:30:43,992
And we can't leave these
people behind to suffer for it.

883
01:30:51,202 --> 01:30:53,672
I suppose that's it then.

884
01:30:55,072 --> 01:30:56,562
Where are you going?

885
01:30:58,442 --> 01:31:00,842
To get in some practice.

886
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:26,890
Come on, Ed! Sword point up,
like Oreius showed us.

887
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:29,370
- En garde!
- Now block.

888
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:34,100
- Hey!
- Peter! Edmund!

889
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:37,010
Whoa, horsie!

890
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:39,580
- My name is Philip.
- Oh.

891
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:41,480
Sorry.

892
01:31:41,590 --> 01:31:44,110
The Witch has demanded
a meeting with Aslan.

893
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,820
She's on her way here.

894
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:50,530
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

895
01:31:51,730 --> 01:31:55,960
- Go away, Witch!
- Empress of the Lone Islands!

896
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:59,640
You don't belong here!
Go away!

897
01:32:23,488 --> 01:32:26,018
You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.

898
01:32:29,468 --> 01:32:32,328
His offense was not against you.

899
01:32:32,898 --> 01:32:36,128
Have you forgotten the laws
upon which Narnia was built?

900
01:32:36,238 --> 01:32:39,678
Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch.

901
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:42,838
I was there when it was written.

902
01:32:43,708 --> 01:32:48,848
Then you'll remember well
that every traitor belongs to me.

903
01:32:49,348 --> 01:32:52,216
His blood is my property.

904
01:32:52,316 --> 01:32:54,586
Try and take him then.

905
01:32:57,356 --> 01:33:02,026
Do you really think that mere force
will deny me my right...

906
01:33:02,696 --> 01:33:04,426
...little King?

907
01:33:06,996 --> 01:33:10,736
Aslan knows that unless I have blood,
as the law demands,

908
01:33:10,836 --> 01:33:14,236
all of Narnia will be overturned

909
01:33:14,336 --> 01:33:17,276
and perish in fire and water.

910
01:33:17,406 --> 01:33:20,606
That boy will die

911
01:33:20,716 --> 01:33:24,236
on the Stone Table...

912
01:33:26,216 --> 01:33:28,316
...as is tradition.

913
01:33:30,756 --> 01:33:33,196
You dare not refuse me.

914
01:33:33,726 --> 01:33:35,096
Enough.

915
01:33:38,194 --> 01:33:40,394
I shall talk with you alone.

916
01:34:33,782 --> 01:34:36,582
She has renounced her claim
on the Son of Adam's blood.

917
01:34:38,692 --> 01:34:41,482
How do I know your promise will be kept?

918
01:35:34,510 --> 01:35:37,640
- Susan!
- Mm?

919
01:36:27,088 --> 01:36:29,888
Shouldn't you both be in bed?

920
01:36:32,428 --> 01:36:34,728
We couldn't sleep.

921
01:36:35,838 --> 01:36:38,096
Please, Aslan.

922
01:36:38,666 --> 01:36:40,326
Couldn't we come with you?

923
01:36:40,436 --> 01:36:43,496
I would be glad of the company
for a while.

924
01:36:45,246 --> 01:36:47,036
Thank you.

925
01:37:11,036 --> 01:37:12,726
It is time.

926
01:37:12,836 --> 01:37:16,236
From here, I must go on alone.

927
01:37:16,336 --> 01:37:17,736
But Aslan...

928
01:37:17,836 --> 01:37:21,296
You have to trust me.
For this must be done.

929
01:37:21,944 --> 01:37:23,674
Thank you, Susan.

930
01:37:23,774 --> 01:37:26,174
Thank you, Lucy.

931
01:37:26,284 --> 01:37:28,274
And farewell.

932
01:38:33,912 --> 01:38:37,542
Behold. The great lion.

933
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:05,200
Do you want some milk?

934
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:08,400
Why doesn't he fight back?

935
01:39:10,180 --> 01:39:12,310
Bind him!

936
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:15,850
Tie him up! Get him!

937
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:22,180
Wait!

938
01:39:23,330 --> 01:39:26,300
Let him first be shaved.

939
01:39:48,318 --> 01:39:49,808
Bring him to me.

940
01:40:50,976 --> 01:40:53,676
You know, Aslan,

941
01:40:53,776 --> 01:40:56,006
I'm a little disappointed in you.

942
01:40:57,916 --> 01:41:01,976
Did you honestly think by all this
that you could save the human traitor?

943
01:41:05,156 --> 01:41:07,984
You are giving me your life

944
01:41:08,094 --> 01:41:10,024
and saving no one.

945
01:41:12,964 --> 01:41:14,864
So much for love.

946
01:41:23,774 --> 01:41:25,904
Tonight...

947
01:41:26,644 --> 01:41:31,174
...the Deep Magic will be appeased!

948
01:41:34,784 --> 01:41:37,414
But tomorrow,

949
01:41:38,894 --> 01:41:42,844
we will take Narnia

950
01:41:42,994 --> 01:41:47,294
forever!

951
01:41:52,202 --> 01:41:54,292
In that knowledge,

952
01:41:54,432 --> 01:41:57,302
despair...

953
01:42:06,182 --> 01:42:08,912
...and die!

954
01:42:27,502 --> 01:42:29,402
The Great Cat...

955
01:42:29,502 --> 01:42:32,162
...is dead!

956
01:42:35,882 --> 01:42:37,870
General.

957
01:42:38,010 --> 01:42:40,950
Prepare your troops for battle.

958
01:42:44,050 --> 01:42:46,450
However short it may be.

959
01:43:34,128 --> 01:43:36,728
It's too late.

960
01:43:36,868 --> 01:43:39,168
He's gone.

961
01:43:59,058 --> 01:44:01,748
He must have known what he was doing.

962
01:44:34,926 --> 01:44:38,456
Get away! Get away, all of you!

963
01:44:38,596 --> 01:44:41,586
No. Look.

964
01:45:02,484 --> 01:45:05,074
We have to tell the others.

965
01:45:05,654 --> 01:45:09,244
- We can't just leave him!
- Lucy, there's no time.

966
01:45:09,394 --> 01:45:11,624
They need to know.

967
01:45:17,894 --> 01:45:19,894
The trees.

968
01:46:04,142 --> 01:46:06,072
Be still, my Princes.

969
01:46:07,912 --> 01:46:11,182
I bring grave news from your sisters.

970
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:28,160
She's right.

971
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:33,200
He's gone.

972
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:40,800
Then you'll have to lead us.

973
01:46:42,950 --> 01:46:48,210
Peter, there's an army out there
and it's ready to follow you.

974
01:46:48,320 --> 01:46:51,810
- I can't.
- Aslan believed you could.

975
01:46:54,820 --> 01:46:56,760
And so do I.

976
01:47:04,470 --> 01:47:08,398
The Witch's army is nearing, sire.
What are your orders?

977
01:47:54,016 --> 01:47:57,606
They come, Your Highness, in numbers
and weapons far greater than our own.

978
01:47:57,716 --> 01:47:59,846
Numbers do not win a battle.

979
01:47:59,956 --> 01:48:03,756
No. But I bet they help.

980
01:49:33,812 --> 01:49:36,302
I have no interest in prisoners.

981
01:49:36,412 --> 01:49:38,212
Kill them all.

982
01:49:38,312 --> 01:49:42,372
Ahh!

983
01:50:26,590 --> 01:50:29,220
Go on!

984
01:50:35,470 --> 01:50:38,160
Look to the sky!

985
01:51:05,098 --> 01:51:06,998
Are you with me?

986
01:51:08,228 --> 01:51:09,568
To the death.

987
01:51:12,738 --> 01:51:17,328
For Narnia and for Aslan!

988
01:51:21,448 --> 01:51:23,678
Go!

989
01:51:23,778 --> 01:51:26,478
Go! For Aslan!

990
01:52:58,674 --> 01:53:00,834
We should go.

991
01:53:06,184 --> 01:53:08,272
I'm so cold.

992
01:53:28,762 --> 01:53:30,762
Ah!

993
01:53:34,242 --> 01:53:36,032
Susan!

994
01:53:52,222 --> 01:53:54,250
Where's Aslan?

995
01:53:55,730 --> 01:53:57,590
What have they done?

996
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:09,260
Aslan!

997
01:54:17,510 --> 01:54:19,880
But we saw the knife. The Witch.

998
01:54:19,980 --> 01:54:23,470
If the Witch knew
the true meaning of sacrifice,

999
01:54:23,590 --> 01:54:26,890
she might have interpreted
the Deep Magic differently.

1000
01:54:26,990 --> 01:54:29,580
That when a willing victim
who has committed no treachery

1001
01:54:29,690 --> 01:54:31,890
is killed in a traitor's stead,

1002
01:54:31,990 --> 01:54:35,230
the Stone Table will crack

1003
01:54:35,330 --> 01:54:38,958
and even death itself
will turn backwards.

1004
01:54:39,068 --> 01:54:41,558
We sent the news that you were dead.

1005
01:54:41,668 --> 01:54:43,828
Peter and Edmund will have gone to war.

1006
01:54:43,938 --> 01:54:45,298
We have to help them.

1007
01:54:45,408 --> 01:54:49,168
We will, dear one, but not alone.

1008
01:54:49,608 --> 01:54:51,268
Climb on my back.

1009
01:54:51,378 --> 01:54:54,078
We have far to go
and little time to get there.

1010
01:54:54,178 --> 01:54:56,878
And you may want to cover your ears.

1011
01:55:17,808 --> 01:55:19,778
Fire!

1012
01:55:39,456 --> 01:55:41,256
Yes!

1013
01:55:53,536 --> 01:55:56,436
Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!

1014
01:55:56,546 --> 01:56:00,346
That's the signal. Come on!

1015
01:56:08,184 --> 01:56:09,584
Where are we going?

1016
01:56:19,864 --> 01:56:21,424
Hang on!

1017
01:56:22,704 --> 01:56:24,224
Fall back!

1018
01:56:26,104 --> 01:56:27,534
Go on, fall back!

1019
01:57:04,242 --> 01:57:05,532
Stop!

1020
01:59:18,066 --> 01:59:19,896
Susan, this is...

1021
01:59:20,006 --> 01:59:22,296
Mr. Tumnus!

1022
01:59:23,106 --> 01:59:26,336
Come, we must hurry
and search the castle.

1023
01:59:26,446 --> 01:59:29,176
Peter will need everyone we can find.

1024
01:59:34,946 --> 01:59:36,316
Ah!

1025
01:59:55,834 --> 01:59:58,394
Edmund! There's too many!

1026
01:59:58,504 --> 02:00:00,024
Get out of here!

1027
02:00:00,144 --> 02:00:03,044
Get the girls and get them home!

1028
02:00:05,544 --> 02:00:08,034
You heard him! Let's go!

1029
02:00:27,634 --> 02:00:29,224
Peter said get out of here!

1030
02:00:29,334 --> 02:00:31,134
Peter's not king yet.

1031
02:01:42,370 --> 02:01:43,960
Ah!

1032
02:02:08,428 --> 02:02:09,728
Impossible!

1033
02:02:46,068 --> 02:02:47,698
Ah!

1034
02:03:24,266 --> 02:03:25,566
It is finished.

1035
02:03:27,106 --> 02:03:29,436
- Peter!
- Peter!

1036
02:03:35,076 --> 02:03:37,176
Where's Edmund?

1037
02:03:48,754 --> 02:03:50,554
Edmund!

1038
02:03:50,624 --> 02:03:51,714
Ah!

1039
02:04:43,212 --> 02:04:45,642
When are you gonna learn
to do as you're told?

1040
02:06:21,068 --> 02:06:24,008
To the glistening Eastern Sea,

1041
02:06:24,108 --> 02:06:28,568
I give you Queen Lucy the Valiant.

1042
02:06:53,366 --> 02:06:55,766
To the great Western Wood,

1043
02:06:55,866 --> 02:07:00,166
King Edmund the Just.

1044
02:07:01,306 --> 02:07:04,506
To the radiant Southern Sun,

1045
02:07:05,616 --> 02:07:09,306
Queen Susan, the Gentle.

1046
02:07:10,156 --> 02:07:13,316
And to the clear Northern Sky,

1047
02:07:13,426 --> 02:07:17,086
I give you King Peter,

1048
02:07:17,196 --> 02:07:19,486
the Magnificent.

1049
02:07:22,966 --> 02:07:25,894
Once a King or Queen of Narnia,

1050
02:07:25,994 --> 02:07:29,194
always a King or Queen.

1051
02:07:29,304 --> 02:07:31,034
May your wisdom grace us

1052
02:07:31,134 --> 02:07:34,234
until the stars rain down
from the heavens.

1053
02:07:34,344 --> 02:07:36,674
Long live King Peter!

1054
02:07:36,774 --> 02:07:39,404
Long live King Edmund!

1055
02:07:39,514 --> 02:07:42,034
Long live Queen Susan!

1056
02:07:42,144 --> 02:07:45,484
Long live Queen Lucy!

1057
02:08:09,742 --> 02:08:11,372
Don't worry.

1058
02:08:13,382 --> 02:08:15,312
We'll see him again.

1059
02:08:15,412 --> 02:08:18,972
- When?
- In time.

1060
02:08:19,082 --> 02:08:23,852
One day he'll be here
and the next he won't.

1061
02:08:25,692 --> 02:08:27,592
But you mustn't press him.

1062
02:08:28,462 --> 02:08:31,452
After all, he's not a tame lion.

1063
02:08:32,132 --> 02:08:34,362
No.

1064
02:08:34,462 --> 02:08:36,362
But he is good.

1065
02:08:37,132 --> 02:08:38,722
Here.

1066
02:08:40,372 --> 02:08:42,602
You need it more than I do.

1067
02:09:38,360 --> 02:09:40,488
Are you all right, Philip?

1068
02:09:40,598 --> 02:09:42,858
I'm not as young as I once was.

1069
02:09:45,398 --> 02:09:47,198
Come on, Ed.

1070
02:09:47,668 --> 02:09:50,638
- Just catching my breath.
- That's all we'll catch at this rate.

1071
02:09:50,738 --> 02:09:53,068
- What did he say, Susan?
- "Wait in the castle.

1072
02:09:53,168 --> 02:09:56,368
I'll get the stag myself."

1073
02:10:00,718 --> 02:10:02,508
What's this?

1074
02:10:08,058 --> 02:10:10,418
It seems familiar.

1075
02:10:12,888 --> 02:10:14,788
As if from a dream.

1076
02:10:14,898 --> 02:10:16,918
Or a dream of a dream.

1077
02:10:20,238 --> 02:10:22,498
Spare Oom.

1078
02:10:25,366 --> 02:10:27,896
- Lucy!
- Not again.

1079
02:10:29,636 --> 02:10:32,106
- Lu?
- Come on!

1080
02:10:43,116 --> 02:10:44,646
These aren't branches.

1081
02:10:46,186 --> 02:10:47,126
Ow! Ooh!

1082
02:10:47,256 --> 02:10:50,286
- They're coats.
- Susan, you're on my foot!

1083
02:10:50,396 --> 02:10:52,556
Peter, move off!

1084
02:10:52,666 --> 02:10:54,786
- Stop shoving.
- Stop it!

1085
02:10:54,896 --> 02:10:56,696
I'm not on your toe!

1086
02:11:11,814 --> 02:11:13,444
Oh!

1087
02:11:14,554 --> 02:11:16,104
There you are.

1088
02:11:18,724 --> 02:11:21,454
What were you all
doing in the wardrobe?

1089
02:11:23,394 --> 02:11:26,154
You wouldn't believe us
if we told you, sir.

1090
02:11:31,964 --> 02:11:33,594
Try me.

1091
02:12:36,462 --> 02:12:39,190
I don't think
you'll get back in that way.

1092
02:12:42,330 --> 02:12:46,960
You see... I've already tried.

1093
02:12:49,040 --> 02:12:51,010
Will we ever go back?

1094
02:12:51,110 --> 02:12:52,770
Oh, I expect so.

1095
02:12:53,950 --> 02:12:56,880
But it'll probably happen
when you're not looking for it.

1096
02:12:59,450 --> 02:13:01,040
All the same...

1097
02:13:01,150 --> 02:13:03,640
best to keep your eyes open.
