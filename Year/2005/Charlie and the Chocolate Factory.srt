1
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:19,925
This is a story
of an ordinary little boy...

2
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,136
...named Charlie Bucket.

3
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:28,350
He was not faster or stronger
or more clever than other children.

4
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:35,107
His family was not rich
or powerful or well-connected.

5
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,069
In fact, they barely had enough to eat.

6
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,533
Charlie Bucket was the luckiest boy
in the entire world.

7
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,077
He just didn't know it yet.

8
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,679
- Evening, Buckets.
- Evening.

9
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,306
Hi, Dad.

10
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,643
Soup's almost ready, darling.

11
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,480
Don't suppose there's anything
extra to put in, love.

12
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,942
Oh, well. Nothing goes better
with cabbage than cabbage.

13
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,948
Charlie...

14
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,868
...I found something I think you'll like.

15
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,375
Charlie's father worked
at the local toothpaste factory.

16
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:39,588
The hours were long,
and the pay was terrible...

17
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:44,593
...yet occasionally,
there were unexpected surprises.

18
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,597
It's exactly what I need.

19
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,224
What is it, Charlie?

20
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,775
Dad found it, just the piece I needed.

21
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,944
- What piece was it?
- A head for Willy Wonka.

22
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,363
Well, how wonderful.

23
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,573
It's quite a likeness.

24
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,408
You think so?
- Think so?

25
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,160
I know so.

26
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,997
I saw Willy Wonka
with my own two eyes.

27
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,458
- I used to work for him, you know.
- You did?

28
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,168
- I did.
- He did.

29
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,628
He did.

30
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,797
I love grapes.

31
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:26,343
Of course, I was a much
younger man in those days.

32
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:32,391
Willy Wonka began with
a single store on Cherry Street.

33
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,852
But the whole world wanted his candy.

34
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,566
- Mr. Wonka.
- Yeah?

35
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,527
We need more Wonka bars...

36
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:47,531
...and we're out of chocolate birds.
- Birds?

37
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,157
Birds.

38
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:53,370
Well, then we'll need
to make some more. Here.

39
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,707
Now open.

40
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,964
The man was a genius.

41
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:08,802
Did you know he invented a new way
of making chocolate ice cream...

42
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,639
...so that it stays cold for hours
without a freezer?

43
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:17,310
You can even leave it lying in the sun
on a hot day, and it won't go runny.

44
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:21,356
- But that's impossible.
- But Willy Wonka did it.

45
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,735
Before long...

46
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:29,448
...he decided to build
a proper chocolate factory.

47
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,701
The largest chocolate factory
in history.

48
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,163
Fifty times as big as any other.

49
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,850
Grandpa, don't make it gross.

50
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,730
Tell him about the Indian prince.
He'd like to hear about that.

51
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,566
You mean, Prince Pondicherry?

52
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:09,529
Well, Prince Pondicherry
wrote a letter to Mr. Wonka...

53
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,407
...and asked him to come
all the way out to India...

54
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:17,204
...and build him a colossal palace
entirely out of chocolate.

55
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,875
It will have 100 rooms...

56
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:26,671
...and everything will be made
of dark or light chocolate.

57
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:33,136
True to his word,
the bricks were chocolate...

58
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:36,056
...and the cement holding
them together was chocolate.

59
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:40,101
All the walls and ceilings
were made of chocolate as well.

60
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,856
So were the carpets
and the pictures and the furniture.

61
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,943
It is perfect in every way.

62
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,238
Yeah, but it won't last long.
You better start eating right now.

63
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:55,200
Oh, nonsense. I will not eat my palace.

64
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,703
I intend to live in it.

65
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,959
But Mr. Wonka was right, of course.

66
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:09,798
Soon after this, there came
a very hot day with a boiling sun.

67
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,051
Mmm.

68
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:50,714
The prince sent an urgent telegram
requesting a new palace...

69
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,675
...but Willy Wonka was facing
problems of his own.

70
00:09:55,678 --> 00:10:00,557
All the other chocolate makers, you see,
had grown jealous of Mr. Wonka.

71
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:05,520
They began sending in spies
to steal his secret recipes.

72
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:37,385
Fickelgruber started making
an ice cream that would never melt.

73
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:41,931
Prodnose came out with a chewing gum
that never lost its flavor.

74
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,893
Then Slugworth
began making candy balloons...

75
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:48,063
...that you could blow up
to incredible sizes.

76
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:51,191
The thievery got so bad...

77
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,526
...that one day, without warning...

78
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:58,239
...Mr. Wonka told every single one
of his workers to go home.

79
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:03,244
He announced that he was closing
his chocolate factory forever.

80
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:07,624
I'm closing my chocolate factory
forever.

81
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,084
I'm sorry.

82
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,812
But it didn't close forever.
It's open right now.

83
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:33,233
Ah, yes, sometimes when grownups say
"forever," they mean "a very long time. "

84
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:37,112
Such as, "I feel like I've eaten
nothing but cabbage soup forever. "

85
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,949
- Now, Pops.
- The factory did close, Charlie.

86
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:45,120
And it seemed like it was
going to be closed forever.

87
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,958
Then one day we saw smoke
rising from the chimneys.

88
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:54,003
- The factory was back in business.
- Did you get your job back?

89
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,297
No.

90
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,299
No one did.

91
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,596
But there must be
people working there.

92
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:07,308
Think about it, Charlie.
Have you ever seen a single person...

93
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,145
...going into that factory
or coming out of it?

94
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,524
No. The gates are always closed.

95
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:16,359
Exactly.

96
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,028
But then, who's running the machines?

97
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:22,157
- Nobody knows, Charlie.
- It certainly is a mystery.

98
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,659
Hasn't someone asked Mr. Wonka?

99
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,372
Nobody sees him anymore.
He never comes out.

100
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:34,461
The only thing that comes
out of that place is the candy...

101
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:37,172
...already packed and addressed.

102
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:42,761
I'd give anything in the world
just to go in one more time...

103
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:47,015
...and see what's become
of that amazing factory.

104
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,561
Well, you won't, because you can't.
No one can.

105
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,690
It's a mystery,
and it will always be a mystery.

106
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,653
That little factory of yours, Charlie, is as
close as any of us is ever going to get.

107
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:06,034
Come on, Charlie. I think it's time
we let your grandparents get some sleep.

108
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:11,289
- Good night, Grandpa George.
- Night, Charlie.

109
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,541
- Night-night.
Chair.

110
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,585
Thank you, dear.

111
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,005
Night, Grandpa Joe.

112
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,717
Good night, Grandma Georgina.

113
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,054
Nothing's impossible, Charlie.

114
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,532
- Good night.
Night, Charlie.

115
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,283
Sleep well.

116
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,963
Indeed, that very night...

117
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,591
...the impossible
had already been set in motion.

118
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,279
Dear people of the world...

119
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,197
...I, Willy Wonka...

120
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:12,994
...have decided to allow five children
to visit my factory this year.

121
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,831
In addition, one of these children
shall receive a special prize...

122
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:20,585
...beyond anything
you could ever imagine.

123
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,004
Five golden tickets have been hidden...

124
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,507
...underneath the ordinary wrapping
paper of five ordinary Wonka bars.

125
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,885
The bars may be anywhere...

126
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:34,807
...in any shop, in any street, in any
town, in any country in the world.

127
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,762
Wouldn't it be something, Charlie,
to open a bar of candy...

128
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,348
...and find a golden ticket inside?

129
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:20,228
I know, but I only get one bar a year,
for my birthday.

130
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,063
Well, it's your birthday next week.

131
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,692
You have as much chance
as anybody does.

132
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,903
Balderdash. The kids who are
going to find the golden tickets...

133
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,906
...are the ones who can afford
to buy candy bars every day.

134
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,994
Our Charlie gets only one a year.
He doesn't have a chance.

135
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,788
Everyone has a chance, Charlie.

136
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:42,917
Mark my words,
the kid who finds the first ticket...

137
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,461
...will be fat, fat, fat.

138
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,880
Augustus. This way.

139
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,804
I am eating the Wonka bar...

140
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:58,266
...and I taste something
that is not chocolate...

141
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,060
...or coconut...

142
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,938
...or walnut or peanut butter...

143
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,357
...or nougat...

144
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:11,279
...or butter brittle
or caramel or sprinkles.

145
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,490
So I look...

146
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,452
...and I find the golden ticket.

147
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,787
Augustus, how did you celebrate?

148
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,707
I eat more candy.

149
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,796
We knew Augustus would find
the golden ticket.

150
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,716
He eats so many candy bars a day...

151
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,636
...that it was not possible
for him not to find one.

152
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,973
Yes, it is good, Augustus.

153
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,392
- Golden ticket claimed and four more...

154
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,144
Told you it'd be a porker.

155
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,438
What a repulsive boy.

156
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,523
Only four golden tickets left.

157
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:52,320
Now that they've found one,
things will really get crazy.

158
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,489
- Of every shape, size and hue.

159
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,079
Veruca.
Can you spell that for us, please?

160
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,791
V- E-R-U-C-A. Veruca Salt.

161
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:10,129
As soon as little Veruca told me she had
to have one of these golden tickets...

162
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,382
...I started buying all the Wonka bars
I could lay my hands on.

163
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,385
Thousands of them.
Hundreds of thousands.

164
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,973
I'm in the nut business, you see.
So I say to my workers:

165
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:24,519
Morning, ladies. From now on,
you can stop shelling peanuts...

166
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:27,939
...and start shelling the wrappers
off these chocolate bars instead.

167
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,372
Three days went by,
and we had no luck.

168
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,084
Oh, it was terrible. My Veruca
got more and more upset each day.

169
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,710
Where's my golden ticket?

170
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:52,213
I want my golden ticket.

171
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:57,385
Well, gentlemen, I just hated to see
my little girl feeling unhappy like that.

172
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:01,097
I vowed I would keep searching
until I could give her what she wanted.

173
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,893
And finally, I found her a ticket.

174
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,715
Daddy, I want another pony.

175
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,635
She's even worse than the fat boy.

176
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,764
I don't think that was really fair.
She didn't find the ticket herself.

177
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:48,394
Don't worry about it, Charlie.
That man spoils his daughter.

178
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:52,481
And no good ever comes
from spoiling a child like that.

179
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,199
Charlie, Mum and I thought...

180
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,243
...maybe you wanna open
your birthday present tonight.

181
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,126
Here you are.

182
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,140
Maybe I should wait till morning.

183
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,142
- Like hell.
- Pop.

184
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:34,148
All together, we're 381 years old.
We don't wait.

185
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:44,867
Now, Charlie,
you mustn't feel too disappointed...

186
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,994
...you know, if you don't get the...

187
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,330
Whatever happens,
you'll still have the candy.

188
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,528
Ah, well.

189
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,697
That's that.

190
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,201
- We'll share it.
- Oh, no, Charlie.

191
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,995
Not your birthday present.

192
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:33,207
It's my candy bar,
and I'll do what I want with it.

193
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,382
Thank you, darling.

194
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,926
Thank you, Charlie.

195
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,724
Bless you.

196
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,835
All right, let's see who found it.

197
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,760
"The third ticket was found
by Miss Violet Beauregarde. "

198
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,803
Hah! Hah! Hyah!

199
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:50,076
These are just some of the 263
trophies and medals my Violet has won.

200
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,662
I'm a gum chewer mostly, but when
I heard about these ticket things...

201
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,040
...I laid off the gum,
switched to candy bars.

202
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,418
She's just a driven young woman.
I don't know where she gets it.

203
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,131
I'm the Junior World Champion
Gum Chewer.

204
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,300
This piece of gum
I'm chewing right now...

205
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:10,388
...I've been working on for
three months solid. That's a record.

206
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:14,975
Of course, I did have my share
of trophies, mostly baton.

207
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:19,605
So it says that one kid's gonna get
this special prize, better than all the rest.

208
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,984
I don't care who those other four are.
That kid, it's gonna be me.

209
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,611
Tell them why, Violet.

210
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,363
Because I'm a winner.

211
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,657
What a beastly girl.

212
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,951
Despicable.

213
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,328
You don't know
what we're talking about.

214
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,998
Dragonflies?

215
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,834
But wait, this is just in.

216
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:45,506
The fourth golden ticket has been found
by a boy called Mike Teavee.

217
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,271
All you had to do was track
the manufacturing dates...

218
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,858
...offset by weather
and the derivative of the Nikkei Index.

219
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,152
A retard could figure it out.

220
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,030
Most of the time
I don't know what he's talking about.

221
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:13,117
You know, kids these days,
what with all the technology...

222
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,536
Die! Die! Die!

223
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:19,540
Doesn't seem like
they stay kids very long.

224
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,047
In the end,
I only had to buy one candy bar.

225
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,217
- And how did it taste?
- I don't know.

226
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,760
I hate chocolate.

227
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:35,890
It's a good thing you're going to a
chocolate factory, you ungrateful little...

228
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,612
That question is,
who will be the winner of the last gold...?

229
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,745
- Dad?
- Yes, Charlie?

230
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,997
Why aren't you at work?

231
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:05,044
Oh, well, the toothpaste factory
thought they'd give me a bit of time off.

232
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,087
Like summer vacation?

233
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:10,132
Sure. Something like that.

234
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:17,473
In fact, it wasn't like a vacation at all.

235
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:22,770
The upswing in candy sales
had led to a rise in cavities...

236
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,981
...which led to a rise
in toothpaste sales.

237
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:34,448
With the extra money,
the factory had decided to modernize...

238
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,577
...eliminating Mr. Bucket's job.

239
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,460
We were barely making
ends meet as it was.

240
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,671
You'll find another job.

241
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:53,008
Until then, I'll just... Well, I'll just
thin down the soup a little more.

242
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:58,472
Don't worry, Mr. Bucket,
our luck will change.

243
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,432
I know it.

244
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,646
Charlie.

245
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,164
My secret hoard.

246
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:31,005
You and I are going to have
one more fling...

247
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,465
...at finding that last ticket.

248
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,468
You sure you want to spend
your money on that?

249
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,346
Of course I'm sure. Here.

250
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,100
Run down to the nearest store...

251
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:47,104
...and buy the first
Wonka candy bar you see.

252
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:50,816
Bring it straight back,
and we'll open it together.

253
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,910
Such a good boy, really.

254
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,371
Such a good...

255
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,375
Grandpa?

256
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,879
- You fell asleep.
- Have you got it?

257
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,386
Which end should we open first?

258
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,222
Just do it quick, like a Band-Aid.

259
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:55,589
Did you see that some kid in Russia
found the last golden ticket?

260
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,841
Yes, it was in the paper this morning.

261
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,512
Good boy. Come on, George.
Good boy.

262
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:56,650
One Wonka Whipple-Scrumptious
Fudgemallow Delight, please.

263
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,319
Okay. Here you go.

264
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,702
The nerve of some people.

265
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,622
I know. Forging a ticket. Come on.

266
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,637
It's a golden ticket.

267
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,976
You found Wonka's last golden ticket.

268
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,645
In my shop too!

269
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:38,192
Listen. I'll buy it from you.
I'll give you $50 and a new bicycle.

270
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,487
Are you crazy?
I'd give him $500 for that ticket.

271
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,198
You wanna sell me your ticket
for $500, young man?

272
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,658
That's enough of that.
Leave the kid alone.

273
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:52,372
Listen. Don't let anyone have it.
Take it straight home, you understand?

274
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,209
Thank you.

275
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,676
Mom! Dad!

276
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,721
I found it!

277
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:10,390
The last golden ticket! It's mine!

278
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,906
Yippee!

279
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,081
Here.

280
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,043
Read it aloud.
Let's hear exactly what it says.

281
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:44,007
"Greetings to you, the lucky finder of
this golden ticket, from Mr. Willy Wonka.

282
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:48,637
I shake you warmly by the hand.
For now, I invite you to my factory...

283
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:52,015
...and be my guest
for one whole day. "

284
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:55,435
"I, Willy Wonka, will conduct you
around the factory myself...

285
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,604
...showing you everything
there is to see. "

286
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,773
"Afterwards,
when it is time to leave...

287
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:03,318
...you will be escorted home
by a procession of large trucks...

288
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:06,780
...each one filled with all the chocolate
you could ever eat. "

289
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:11,660
"And remember, one of you lucky
five children will receive an extra prize...

290
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,037
...beyond your wildest imagination.

291
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,582
Now, here are your instructions. "

292
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:20,669
"On the 1 st of February, you must come
to the factory gates at 10 a. m. Sharp.

293
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:24,214
You're allowed to bring one member
of your family to look after you.

294
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:26,425
Until then, Willy Wonka. "

295
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,635
The 1 st of February.

296
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,598
- But that's tomorrow.
- Then there's not a moment to lose.

297
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,933
Wash your face, comb your hair,
scrub your hands...

298
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,602
...brush your teeth, blow your nose.

299
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,061
And get that mud off your pants.

300
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,272
We must all try and keep very calm.

301
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:45,152
First thing that we have to decide is this:
Who is going with Charlie to the factory?

302
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,572
I will. I'll take him. You leave it to me.

303
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,450
How about you, dear?
Don't you think you ought to go?

304
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:56,163
Well, Grandpa Joe seems to know
more about it than we do, and...

305
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:59,166
Provided, of course,
he feels well enough.

306
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,919
Yippee!

307
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,172
No. We're not going.

308
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:11,762
A woman offered me $500
for the ticket.

309
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,014
I bet someone else would pay more.

310
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,558
We need the money more
than we need the chocolate.

311
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,029
Young man, come here.

312
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,535
There's plenty of money out there.

313
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,829
They print more every day.

314
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,707
But this ticket...

315
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,795
...there's only five of them
in the whole world...

316
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,297
...and that's all
there's ever going to be.

317
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:53,220
Only a dummy would give this up
for something as common as money.

318
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,973
Are you a dummy?

319
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,225
No, sir.

320
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:02,854
Then get that mud off your pants.
You've got a factory to go to.

321
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,276
Daddy, I want to go in.

322
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,944
It's 9:59, sweetheart.

323
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,655
Make time go faster.

324
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,033
Do you think Mr. Wonka
will recognize you?

325
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,162
Hard to say. It's been years.

326
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,296
Eyes on the prize, Violet.

327
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,757
Eyes on the prize.

328
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,027
Please enter.

329
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:46,458
Come forward.

330
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,590
Close the gates.

331
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,850
Dear visitors...

332
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:09,231
...it is my great pleasure to welcome you
to my humble factory.

333
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,568
And who am I?

334
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,738
Well...

335
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,244
Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka

336
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,371
The amazing chocolatier

337
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,540
Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka

338
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,667
Everybody give a cheer!
Hooray!

339
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,710
He's modest, clever and so smart

340
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,546
He barely can restrain it

341
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,714
With so much generosity

342
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,550
There is no way to contain it!

343
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:40,095
To contain it
To contain, to contain, to contain!

344
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,097
Hooray!

345
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,599
Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka

346
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,601
He's the one that you're about to meet

347
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:48,353
Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka

348
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,814
He's the genius who just can't be beat

349
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,732
The magician and the chocolate wiz

350
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:54,609
The best darn guy who ever lived

351
00:35:54,777 --> 00:36:00,407
Willy Wonka, here he is!

352
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:21,845
The amazing chocolatier

353
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,065
Wasn't that just magnificent?

354
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:38,904
I was worried it was getting dodgy
in the middle part, but then that finale...

355
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,947
Wow!

356
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,076
Who are you?

357
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:48,788
- He's Willy Wonka.
- Really?

358
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,967
"Good morning, starshine.

359
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,303
The Earth says hello. "

360
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,521
"Dear guests, greetings.

361
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:18,610
Welcome to the factory.
I shake you warmly by the hand.

362
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,075
My name is Willy Wonka. "

363
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,952
Then shouldn't you be up there?

364
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:31,456
I couldn't very well watch the show
from up there, now, could I, little girl?

365
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:35,460
Mr. Wonka, I don't know
if you'll remember me...

366
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,505
...but I used to work
here in the factory.

367
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:42,008
Were you one of those despicable spies
who tried to steal...

368
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:46,054
...my life's work and sell it to parasitic,
copycat, candy-making cads?

369
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,555
No, sir.

370
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,808
Then wonderful. Welcome back.

371
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,351
Let's get a move on, kids.

372
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,815
Don't you want to know our names?

373
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:01,695
Can't imagine how it would matter.
Come quickly. Far too much to see.

374
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,202
Just drop your coats anywhere.

375
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:18,712
- Mr. Wonka? Sure is toasty in here.
- What?

376
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:24,009
Oh, I have to keep it warm. My workers
are used to an extremely hot climate.

377
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,386
They just can't stand the cold.

378
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,762
Who are the workers?

379
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,181
All in good time. Now...

380
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,563
Mr. Wonka, I'm Violet Beauregarde.

381
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,316
Oh.

382
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,568
- I don't care.
- Well, you should care.

383
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,195
Because I'm gonna win
the special prize at the end.

384
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:47,282
Well, you do seem confident,
and confidence is key.

385
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,413
I'm Veruca Salt.
It's very nice to meet you, sir.

386
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,249
I always thought a verruca
was a type of wart you got...

387
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,917
...on the bottom of your foot.

388
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,381
I am Augustus Gloop.
I love your chocolate.

389
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,260
I can see that. So do I.

390
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,555
I never expected to have
so much in common.

391
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,395
You. You're Mike Teavee.

392
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,106
You're the little devil
who cracked the system.

393
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:25,278
And you. Well, you're just lucky
to be here, aren't you?

394
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:29,949
And the rest of you must be their...

395
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,834
- Parents.
- Yeah.

396
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,003
Moms and dads.

397
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,215
Dad?

398
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,094
Papa?

399
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,269
Okay, then. Let's move along.

400
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:10,990
Is it just me or does Wonka seem
a few quarters short of a buck?

401
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,326
I'm sorry, I don't speak American.

402
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:17,205
- Would you like some chocolate?
- Sure.

403
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,499
Then you should've brought some.

404
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,547
- Let's be friends.
- Best friends.

405
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,686
An important room, this.

406
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,690
- After all, it is a chocolate factory.
- Then why is the door so small?

407
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,985
That's to keep all the great big
chocolatey flavor inside.

408
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:13,052
Now, do be careful, my dear children.

409
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,013
Don't lose your heads.

410
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,056
Don't get overexcited.

411
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,102
Just keep very calm.

412
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,077
It's beautiful.

413
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,788
What?

414
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,249
Oh, yeah, it's very beautiful.

415
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,428
Every drop of the river...

416
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:59,098
...is hot, melted chocolate
of the finest quality.

417
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,564
The waterfall is most important.

418
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,441
Mixes the chocolate.

419
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,611
Churns it up. Makes it light and frothy.

420
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,446
By the way...

421
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:19,369
...no other factory in the world mixes its
chocolate by waterfall, my dear children.

422
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,412
And you can take that to the bank.

423
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,383
People.

424
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,470
Those pipes...

425
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:42,600
...suck up the chocolate
and carry it away all over the factory.

426
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,979
Thousands of gallons an hour. Yeah.

427
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,316
And do you like my meadow?
Try some of my grass.

428
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:55,029
Please have a blade. Please do. It's
so delectable and so darn good-looking.

429
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,156
You can eat the grass?

430
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,409
Of course you can.

431
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,828
Everything in this room is eatable.

432
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,329
Even I'm eatable.

433
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:06,332
But that is called cannibalism,
my dear children...

434
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,335
...and is, in fact, frowned upon
in most societies.

435
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,837
Yeah.

436
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,423
Enjoy.

437
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:16,342
Go on. Scoot, scoot.

438
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,073
Son.

439
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:41,701
Please.

440
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:45,538
Dad, he said, "Enjoy. "

441
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:02,430
Why hold on to it?
Why not start a new piece?

442
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:07,727
Because then I wouldn't be a champion.
I'd be a loser, like you.

443
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,383
Daddy, look over there.

444
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,761
What is it?

445
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,471
It's a little person.

446
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,099
Over there, by the waterfall.

447
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,937
- There's two of them.
- There's more than two.

448
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,904
- Where do they come from?
- Who are they?

449
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,449
Are they real people?

450
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,119
Of course they're real people.
They're Oompa-Loompas.

451
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,792
- Oompa-Loompas?
- Imported, direct from Loompaland.

452
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,586
- There's no such place.
- What?

453
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:19,257
Mr. Wonka, I teach high-school
geography, and I'm here to tell you...

454
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:24,595
Well, then you'll know all about it,
and, oh, what a terrible country it is.

455
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,942
The whole place is nothing
but thick jungles...

456
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,696
...infested by the most dangerous beasts
in the entire world.

457
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:46,993
Hornswogglers and snozzwangers and
those terrible, wicked whangdoodles.

458
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:12,059
I went to Loompaland looking for
exotic new flavors for candy.

459
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,440
Instead...

460
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,650
...I found the Oompa-Loompas.

461
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:32,747
They lived in tree houses to escape from
the fierce creatures who lived below.

462
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:40,546
The Oompa-Loompas ate nothing but
green caterpillars, which tasted revolting.

463
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,716
The Oompa-Loompas looked for things...

464
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,844
...to mash up with the caterpillars
to make them taste better:

465
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:50,515
Red beetles,
the bark of the bong-bong tree.

466
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,933
All of them beastly...

467
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,102
...but not quite so beastly
as the caterpillars.

468
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,653
Mmm.

469
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:31,472
But the food they longed for the most
was the cocoa bean.

470
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:39,021
An Oompa-Loompa was lucky if he found
three or four cocoa beans a year.

471
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,607
But, oh, how they craved them.

472
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,945
All they'd ever think about
was cocoa beans.

473
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:55,621
The cocoa bean is the thing from which
chocolate is made, so I told the chief:

474
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,978
They are such wonderful workers.

475
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:22,106
I feel I must warn you, though,
they are rather mischievous.

476
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,066
Always making jokes.

477
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,987
Augustus, my child,
that is not a good thing you do!

478
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,991
Hey, little boy.

479
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,202
My chocolate must be untouched
by human hands.

480
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,455
Ah!

481
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,669
He'll drown.

482
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,631
He can't swim.

483
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,341
Save him!

484
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:52,345
Augustus! No!

485
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,728
Augustus!

486
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,698
Augustus, watch out!

487
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:16,702
Ah!

488
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,800
There he goes.

489
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,053
- Ah!
- Call the fire brigade!

490
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,514
It's a wonder how
that pipe is big enough.

491
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,558
It isn't big enough.
He's slowing down.

492
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,018
He's gonna stick.

493
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:43,896
I think he has.

494
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,943
He's blocked the whole pipe.

495
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,948
Look. The Oompa-Loompas.

496
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,412
Back off, you little freaks!

497
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,916
What are they doing?

498
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:10,172
They're going to treat us to a little song.
It is quite a special occasion.

499
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,675
They haven't had a fresh audience
in many a moon.

500
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:35,114
Augustus Gloop, Augustus Gloop

501
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,034
The great big, greedy nincompoop

502
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:43,080
Augustus Gloop, so big and vile
So greedy, foul and infantile

503
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:45,583
"Come on!" we cried
"The time is ripe

504
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,294
To send him shooting up the pipe!"

505
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,755
But don't, dear children, be alarmed

506
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:53,549
Augustus Gloop will not be harmed

507
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,968
Augustus Gloop will not be harmed

508
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,460
Although, of course, we must admit

509
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,837
He will be altered quite a bit

510
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:34,965
Slowly, wheels go round and round

511
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:37,176
And cogs begin to grind and pound

512
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:39,970
We'll boil him for a minute more

513
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:42,348
Until we're absolutely sure

514
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,184
Then out he comes, by God, by grace

515
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:50,356
A miracle has taken place

516
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,234
This greedy brute, this louse's ear

517
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,863
Is loved by people everywhere

518
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,866
For who could hate or bear a grudge

519
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:07,081
Against a luscious bit of fudge?

520
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,882
Ah!

521
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,192
Bravo! Well done!

522
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,570
Aren't they delightful?
Aren't they charming?

523
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:42,241
- I say, that all seemed rather rehearsed.
- Like they knew it was gonna happen.

524
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:44,702
Oh, poppycock.

525
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,541
Where is my son?
Where does that pipe go to?

526
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,503
That pipe, it just so happens to lead...

527
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,006
...directly to the room
where I make delicious...

528
00:52:57,174 --> 00:52:59,592
...strawberry-flavored,
chocolate-coated fudge.

529
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:03,304
He will be made into strawberry-flavored,
chocolate-coated fudge.

530
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:07,016
They'll be selling him by the pound
all over the world?

531
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:10,060
No. I wouldn't allow it.
The taste would be terrible.

532
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:14,398
Can you imagine Augustus-flavored,
chocolate-coated Gloop? Ew.

533
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,941
No one would buy it.

534
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:28,037
I want you to take Mrs. Gloop
up to the Fudge Room, okay?

535
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,705
Help her find her son.

536
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:35,461
Take a long stick and start poking around
in the big chocolate-mixing barrel, okay?

537
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,812
- Mr. Wonka?
- Huh?

538
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:57,691
Why would Augustus' name already
be in the Oompa-Loompa song, unless...?

539
00:53:57,859 --> 00:54:01,487
Improvisation is a parlor trick.
Anyone can do it.

540
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,781
You, little girl. Say something.

541
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,991
- Anything.
- Chewing gum.

542
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,203
Chewing gum is really gross
Chewing gum, I hate the most

543
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,413
See? Exactly the same.

544
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:12,998
No, it isn't.

545
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,668
Uh, you really shouldn't mumble.

546
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:18,128
Because I can't understand
a word you're saying.

547
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,133
Now, on with the tour.

548
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:29,807
- Are the Oompa-Loompas really joking?
- Of course they're joking.

549
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:32,518
That boy will be fine.

550
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:22,693
What's so funny?

551
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:26,196
I think it's from all those
doggone cocoa beans.

552
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:30,242
Hey, by the way, did you guys know
that chocolate contains a property...

553
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:35,205
...that triggers the release of endorphins?
Gives one the feeling of being in love.

554
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,082
You don't say.

555
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,879
All aboard.

556
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,599
Onward!

557
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,124
Here.

558
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:23,837
Try some of this. It'll do you good.
You look starved to death.

559
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:29,760
- It's great.
- That's because it's mixed by waterfall.

560
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,470
The waterfall is most important.

561
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:35,891
Mixes the chocolate, churns it up,
makes it light and frothy.

562
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:40,562
- No other factory in the world...
- You already said that.

563
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:49,780
- You're all quite short, aren't you?
- Well, yeah. We're children.

564
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,574
Well, that's no excuse.
I was never as short as you.

565
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:56,036
- You were once.
- Was not. Know why?

566
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:59,915
Because I distinctly remember
putting a hat on top of my head.

567
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:03,710
Look at your short, little arms.
You could never reach.

568
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,715
Do you even remember
what it was like being a kid?

569
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:10,968
Oh, boy, do I.

570
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:15,806
Do I?

571
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:17,391
In fact, Willy Wonka...

572
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:20,894
...hadn't thought about his childhood
for years.

573
00:57:21,062 --> 00:57:23,480
Trick or treat!

574
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:25,399
Trick or treat!

575
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:35,033
Trick or treat!

576
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,537
Who do we have here?

577
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:42,416
Ruthie, Veronica, Terrance.

578
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,126
And who's that under the sheet?

579
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:49,381
Little Willy Wonka.

580
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:56,680
Willy Wonka was the son
of the city's most famous dentist...

581
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,807
...Wilbur Wonka.

582
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,357
Now...

583
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:10,360
...let's see what the damage is
this year, shall we?

584
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:26,335
Caramels.

585
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:30,172
They'd get stuck in your braces,
wouldn't they?

586
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:36,970
Lollipops.

587
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:40,891
Ought to be called
"cavities on a stick. "

588
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,519
Then we have all this...

589
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,062
All this...

590
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,064
...chocolate.

591
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:53,070
You know, just last week, I was reading
in a very important medical journal...

592
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:57,908
...that some children
are allergic to chocolate.

593
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:00,786
Makes their noses itch.

594
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:03,413
Maybe I'm not allergic.

595
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,916
- I could try a piece.
- Really?

596
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:09,211
But why take a chance?

597
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:27,563
Mr. Wonka? Mr. Wonka?

598
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:30,065
- We're headed for a tunnel.
- Oh, yeah.

599
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:31,650
Full speed ahead.

600
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:41,326
- How can they see where they're going?
- They can't.

601
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,829
There's no knowing
where they're going.

602
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,455
Switch on the lights!

603
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:14,610
People, keep an eye out.

604
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,903
We're passing some
very important rooms here.

605
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:24,036
What do you use hair cream for?

606
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:26,872
To lock in moisture.

607
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:36,548
- Whipped cream.
- Precisely.

608
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,467
That doesn't make sense.

609
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,345
For your information, little girl...

610
01:00:41,512 --> 01:00:45,349
...whipped cream isn't whipped cream at
all unless it's been whipped with whips.

611
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:47,643
Everybody knows that.

612
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:40,195
Stop the boat.
I wanna show you guys something.

613
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:04,219
Now, this is the most important room
in the entire factory.

614
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:08,849
Now, everyone, enjoy yourselves,
but just don't touch anything.

615
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,267
Okay? Go on.

616
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:11,768
Go on, scoot.

617
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,115
Hey, Mr. Wonka, what's this?

618
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:29,286
Oh. Let me show you.

619
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,372
Thank you.

620
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:34,708
These are Everlasting Gobstoppers.

621
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:37,586
They're for children who are given
very little allowance.

622
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:41,173
You can suck on it all year,
and it'll never get any smaller.

623
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,800
- Isn't that neat?
- It's like gum.

624
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:46,887
No. Gum is for chewing.

625
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:49,347
If you tried chewing
one of these Gobstoppers...

626
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,558
...you'd break all your little teeth off.

627
01:02:51,726 --> 01:02:54,060
But they sure do taste terrific.

628
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,737
And this is Hair Toffee.

629
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:06,239
You suck down one of
these little boogers...

630
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:08,325
...and in exactly half an hour...

631
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:12,245
...a brand-new crop of hair will grow out
over the top of your little noggin.

632
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:14,623
And a mustache. And a beard.

633
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,334
- Who wants a beard?
- Well...

634
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:20,670
...beatniks, for one.
Folk singers and motorbike riders.

635
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:24,966
You know, all those hip, jazzy,
super-cool, neat, keen and groovy cats.

636
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:27,636
It's in the fridge, daddy-o.
Are you hep to the jive?

637
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,888
Can you dig what I'm laying down?
I knew you could.

638
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,682
Slide me some skin, soul brother.

639
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,896
Unfortunately,
the mixture isn't right yet.

640
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:41,358
Because an Oompa-Loompa
tried some yesterday, and, well, he...

641
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,364
How are you today?

642
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,575
You look great.

643
01:03:59,252 --> 01:04:00,710
Watch this.

644
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,448
You mean that's it?

645
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:32,868
Do you even know what "it" is?

646
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:35,245
- It's gum.
- Yeah.

647
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:39,416
It's a stick of the most amazing and
sensational gum in the whole universe.

648
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,751
Know why? Know why?

649
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:45,171
Because this gum is a full
three-course dinner all by itself.

650
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:49,926
Why would anyone want that?

651
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,811
"It will be the end of all kitchens
and all cooking.

652
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:03,690
Just a little strip of Wonka's magic
chewing gum and that is all you will...

653
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:05,984
...ever need at breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

654
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:10,572
This piece of gum happens to be tomato
soup, roast beef and blueberry pie. "

655
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,657
It sounds great.

656
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,286
- It sounds weird.
- It sounds like my kind of gum.

657
01:05:19,165 --> 01:05:22,083
I'd rather you didn't.
There are still some things that are...

658
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:25,670
I'm the world-record holder in
chewing gum. I'm not afraid of anything.

659
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:34,346
- How is it, honey?
- It's amazing!

660
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:37,140
Tomato soup.
I can feel it running down my throat.

661
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:38,767
Yeah. Spit it out.

662
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,478
- Young lady, I think you'd better...
- It's changing.

663
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,481
Roast beef, with baked potato.

664
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:47,484
- Crispy skin and butter.
- Keep chewing.

665
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:50,987
My little girl's gonna be the first person
to have a chewing-gum meal.

666
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:53,615
Yeah. I'm just a little concerned
about the...

667
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,450
Blueberry pie and ice cream!

668
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,536
- That part.
- What's happening to her nose?

669
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,502
It's turning blue.

670
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,131
Your whole nose has gone purple.

671
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:12,717
What do you mean?

672
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:16,054
Violet, you're turning violet.

673
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:20,684
- What's happening?
- I told you I hadn't quite got it right.

674
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:23,895
Because it goes a little funny
when it gets to the dessert.

675
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:25,772
It's the blueberry pie that does it.

676
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:28,733
I'm terribly sorry.

677
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:40,745
Mother? What's happening to me?

678
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:54,884
She's swelling up.

679
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,265
Like a blueberry.

680
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:33,048
I've tried it on, like, 20 Oompa-Loompas,
and each one ended up as a blueberry.

681
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,008
It's just weird.

682
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:37,177
But I can't have a blueberry
as a daughter.

683
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:38,928
How is she supposed to compete?

684
01:07:39,096 --> 01:07:40,513
You could put her in a county fair.

685
01:07:54,820 --> 01:07:56,821
Yeah, yeah

686
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:02,911
Yeah

687
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,246
Listen close, and listen hard

688
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,290
To the tale of Violet Beauregarde

689
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:10,001
This gentle girl
She sees no wrong

690
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:12,587
In chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing

691
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:22,138
Chewing, chewing all day long

692
01:08:23,641 --> 01:08:24,974
Yeah

693
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,528
She goes on chewing till, at last

694
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:38,822
Her chewing muscles grow so vast

695
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:41,324
And from her face
Her giant chin

696
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:43,827
Sticks out just like a violin

697
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:46,162
Chewing, chewing all day long

698
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:51,000
Chewing, chewing all day long

699
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,841
For years and years she chews away

700
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:00,343
Her jaws get stronger every day

701
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:02,679
And with one great, tremendous chew

702
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:05,056
They bite the poor girl's tongue in two

703
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,392
And that is why we try so hard

704
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:10,145
To save Miss Violet Beauregarde

705
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,522
Chewing, chewing all day long

706
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,899
Chewing, chewing all day long

707
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:17,360
Chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing

708
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:26,202
Chewing, chewing all day long

709
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,538
Mr. Wonka!

710
01:09:33,919 --> 01:09:36,379
I want you to roll Miss Beauregarde
into the boat...

711
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:40,300
...and take her along to
the Juicing Room at once, okay?

712
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:43,428
Juicing Room?
What are they gonna do to her there?

713
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,722
They're gonna squeeze her.

714
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:47,849
Like a little pimple.

715
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:51,728
We gotta squeeze all that juice
out of her immediately.

716
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,566
Mother, help me.

717
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,443
Please.

718
01:10:03,532 --> 01:10:05,200
Come on.

719
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:06,784
Let's boogie.

720
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:10,580
Without the boat, we'll have to move
double-time to keep on schedule.

721
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:12,040
There's too much to see.

722
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,249
- Mr. Wonka?
- Yeah?

723
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,251
Why did you decide to let people in?

724
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:17,462
So they could see the factory,
of course.

725
01:10:17,671 --> 01:10:20,048
But why now? And why only five?

726
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,508
What's the special prize,
and who gets it?

727
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:24,552
The best kind of prize is a surprise.

728
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:28,056
Will Violet always be a blueberry?

729
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:30,308
No. Maybe. I don't know.

730
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:33,603
That's what you get from chewing gum
all day. It's disgusting.

731
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:36,147
If you hate gum so much,
why do you make it?

732
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:39,275
Once again, you shouldn't mumble.
It's starting to bum me out.

733
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:42,362
Can you remember the first candy
you ever ate?

734
01:10:45,991 --> 01:10:47,200
No.

735
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:49,369
In fact, Willy Wonka did remember...

736
01:10:49,536 --> 01:10:53,539
...the first candy he ever ate.

737
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,811
I'm sorry, I was having a flashback.

738
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,188
I see.

739
01:11:59,565 --> 01:12:01,482
These flashbacks happen often?

740
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,609
Increasingly...

741
01:12:03,902 --> 01:12:05,236
...today.

742
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:14,787
Ah, this is a room I know all about.

743
01:12:14,955 --> 01:12:18,082
For you see, Mr. Wonka,
I, myself, am in the nut business.

744
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:21,669
Are you using the Havermax 4000
to do your sorting?

745
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:23,463
No.

746
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:25,089
You're really weird.

747
01:12:46,403 --> 01:12:49,113
- Squirrels.
- Yeah. Squirrels.

748
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:52,533
These squirrels are specially trained
to get the nuts out of shells.

749
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:11,427
Why use squirrels?
Why not use Oompa-Loompas?

750
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:16,140
Because only squirrels can get the whole
walnut out almost every single time.

751
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:19,936
See how they tap them with their
knuckles to make sure it's not bad?

752
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:21,646
Oh, look. Look.

753
01:13:23,399 --> 01:13:24,982
I think that one's got a bad nut.

754
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:29,070
Daddy, I want a squirrel.

755
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,447
Get me one of those squirrels.
I want one.

756
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,450
Veruca, dear,
you have many marvelous pets.

757
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:38,621
All I've got at home is one pony and
two dogs and four cats and six rabbits...

758
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:42,333
...and two parakeets and three canaries
and a green parrot and a turtle...

759
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:45,670
...and a silly old hamster.
I want a squirrel!

760
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:47,338
All right, pet.

761
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:50,216
Daddy will get you a squirrel
as soon as he possibly can.

762
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:53,928
But I don't want any old squirrel,
I want a trained squirrel.

763
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:56,848
Very well.

764
01:13:57,182 --> 01:14:00,351
Mr. Wonka, how much do you want
for one of these squirrels?

765
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:02,478
Name your price.

766
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:05,982
Oh, they're not for sale.
She can't have one.

767
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:12,572
Daddy.

768
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:15,491
I'm sorry, darling.

769
01:14:15,951 --> 01:14:18,119
Mr. Wonka's being unreasonable.

770
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:24,292
If you won't get me a squirrel,
I'll get one myself.

771
01:14:33,218 --> 01:14:34,594
Veruca.

772
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:37,597
Little girl?

773
01:14:41,393 --> 01:14:43,227
Veruca, come back here at once.

774
01:14:45,856 --> 01:14:47,482
Veruca.

775
01:14:59,369 --> 01:15:00,786
Little girl?

776
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:03,039
Don't touch that squirrel's nuts.

777
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:05,333
It'll make him crazy.

778
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,100
I'll have you.

779
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,774
Veruca.

780
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:37,406
Veruca.

781
01:15:39,618 --> 01:15:41,160
No!

782
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:46,916
Veruca!

783
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:51,420
Let's find the key.

784
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:54,215
Nope. Not that one.

785
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:57,552
- Daddy!
- Veruca!

786
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:00,805
No. It's not that one.

787
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:14,110
There it is.

788
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:15,486
There it isn't.

789
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:17,405
Daddy, I want them to stop.

790
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,584
What are they doing?

791
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,752
They're testing to see
if she's a bad nut.

792
01:16:33,839 --> 01:16:36,632
Oh, my goodness.
She is a bad nut after all.

793
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,141
Veruca!

794
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:47,101
Daddy!

795
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:48,811
Where are they taking her?

796
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:51,772
Where all the other bad nuts go.
To the garbage chute.

797
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,526
- Where does the chute go?
- To the incinerator.

798
01:16:56,361 --> 01:16:58,696
But don't worry.
We only light it on Tuesdays.

799
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,489
Today is Tuesday.

800
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:05,703
There's always the chance
they decided not to light it today.

801
01:17:15,547 --> 01:17:17,006
- Ah!
- Ah!

802
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:27,016
Now, she may be stuck in the chute
just below the top.

803
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:30,811
If that's the case, all you have to do
is just reach in and pull her out.

804
01:17:31,688 --> 01:17:32,897
Okay?

805
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:14,063
Veruca Salt, the little brute

806
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:17,358
Has just gone down the garbage chute

807
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:21,612
And she will meet, as she descends

808
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:31,956
A rather different set of friends

809
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:35,251
A fish head, for example, cut

810
01:18:35,460 --> 01:18:38,504
This morning from a halibut

811
01:18:38,672 --> 01:18:41,924
An oyster from an oyster stew

812
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:45,845
A steak that no one else would chew

813
01:18:46,012 --> 01:18:49,348
And lots of other things as well

814
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:55,646
Each with its rather horrid smell

815
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:59,567
Horrid smell

816
01:18:59,901 --> 01:19:03,112
These are Veruca's newfound friends

817
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:06,824
That she will meet as she descends

818
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:12,246
These are Veruca's newfound friends

819
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:34,894
Who went and spoiled her, who indeed?

820
01:19:35,061 --> 01:19:38,481
Who pandered to her every need?

821
01:19:38,648 --> 01:19:41,859
Who turned her into such a brat?

822
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:43,819
Who are the culprits?

823
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:45,488
Who did that?

824
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:48,949
The guilty ones, now this is sad

825
01:19:49,242 --> 01:19:52,828
Are dear old Mum and loving Dad

826
01:19:53,747 --> 01:19:54,830
Ah!

827
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:05,674
Oh, really? Oh, good.

828
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,427
I've just been informed
that the incinerator's broken.

829
01:20:08,595 --> 01:20:12,181
So there should be about three weeks
of rotten garbage to break their fall.

830
01:20:12,349 --> 01:20:13,849
Well, that's good news.

831
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:15,643
Yeah.

832
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,896
Well, let's keep on trucking.

833
01:20:21,566 --> 01:20:23,776
I don't know why
I didn't think of this earlier.

834
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:27,154
The elevator's by far the most
efficient way to get around the factory.

835
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:29,156
There can't be this many floors.

836
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:32,159
How do you know, Mr. Smarty-Pants?

837
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:35,079
This isn't an ordinary
up-and-down elevator, by the way.

838
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:37,748
This elevator can go sideways,
longways, slantways...

839
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:39,542
...and any other ways
you can think of.

840
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:42,586
You just press any button
and, whoosh, you're off.

841
01:20:52,764 --> 01:20:54,098
Oh, look. Look.

842
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:58,435
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Fudge Mountain.

843
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:22,376
Oh.

844
01:21:27,465 --> 01:21:29,258
I'd rather not talk about this one.

845
01:21:40,645 --> 01:21:42,771
This is the Puppet Hospital
and Burn Center.

846
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:50,154
It's relatively new.

847
01:21:56,786 --> 01:21:58,287
Ah, the administration offices.

848
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:01,874
Hello, Doris.

849
01:22:37,202 --> 01:22:39,995
Why is everything here
completely pointless?

850
01:22:40,205 --> 01:22:42,164
Candy doesn't have to have a point.

851
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:43,666
That's why it's candy.

852
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:45,334
It's stupid.

853
01:22:45,877 --> 01:22:49,088
Candy is a waste of time.

854
01:22:49,714 --> 01:22:52,967
No son of mine is going to be
a chocolatier.

855
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,052
Then I'll run away.

856
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,346
To Switzerland. Bavaria.

857
01:22:57,597 --> 01:22:59,515
The candy capitals of the world.

858
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:01,558
Go ahead.

859
01:23:01,726 --> 01:23:03,560
But I won't be here
when you come back.

860
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:33,424
Sorry, son.

861
01:23:33,591 --> 01:23:36,093
We're closing for the night.

862
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:03,203
I wanna pick a room.

863
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:07,708
Go ahead.

864
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:27,853
Here.

865
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:31,231
Put these on quick, and don't
take them off whatever you do.

866
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,818
This light could burn your eyeballs
right out of your skulls.

867
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:38,113
And we certainly don't want that,
now, do we?

868
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:44,661
This is the testing room for my
very latest and greatest invention:

869
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,539
Television Chocolate.

870
01:24:47,707 --> 01:24:48,957
One day it occurred to me:

871
01:24:49,125 --> 01:24:51,710
"Hey, if television can break up
a photograph...

872
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:55,923
...into millions and millions of tiny pieces
and send it whizzing through the air...

873
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,008
...then reassemble it
on the other end...

874
01:24:58,176 --> 01:25:00,177
...why can't I do the same
with chocolate?

875
01:25:00,637 --> 01:25:03,472
Why can't I send a real bar
of chocolate...

876
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,016
...through the television,
all ready to be eaten?"

877
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:09,937
I'm not gonna touch it.
I'm not going in that direction.

878
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:12,606
Sounds impossible.

879
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:14,399
It is impossible.

880
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:18,028
You don't understand anything
about science.

881
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:23,283
First off, there's a difference between
waves and particles. Duh.

882
01:25:23,451 --> 01:25:27,037
Second, the amount of power it
would take to convert energy in matter...

883
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:28,997
...would be like nine atomic bombs.

884
01:25:29,207 --> 01:25:30,666
Mumbler!

885
01:25:31,501 --> 01:25:35,504
Seriously, I cannot understand
a single word you're saying.

886
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:40,551
Okey-dokey.

887
01:25:40,718 --> 01:25:44,054
I shall now send a bar of chocolate
from one end of the room...

888
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:47,307
...to the other by television.

889
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:48,892
Bring in the chocolate.

890
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:12,332
It's gotta be real big
because you know how on TV...

891
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,878
...you can film a regular-size man,
and he comes out looking this tall?

892
01:26:16,045 --> 01:26:17,462
Same basic principle.

893
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:51,038
It's gone.

894
01:26:51,998 --> 01:26:56,126
Told you. That chocolate is now rushing
through the air above our heads...

895
01:26:56,294 --> 01:26:58,754
...in a million tiny little pieces.

896
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:01,798
Come over here.
Come on. Come on. Come on!

897
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:09,139
Watch the screen.

898
01:27:12,518 --> 01:27:14,144
Here it comes.

899
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:16,813
Oh, look.

900
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:23,612
- Take it.
- It's just a picture on a screen.

901
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:25,822
Scaredy-cat.

902
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:27,491
You take it.

903
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:30,619
Go on. Just reach out and grab it.

904
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:40,295
Go on.

905
01:27:48,304 --> 01:27:50,138
Holy buckets.

906
01:27:53,142 --> 01:27:55,269
Eat it. Go on.

907
01:27:55,436 --> 01:27:57,604
It'll be delicious. It's the same bar.

908
01:27:57,772 --> 01:28:01,066
It's just gotten a little smaller
on the journey, that's all.

909
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:10,909
It's great.

910
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:12,452
It's a miracle.

911
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:17,082
So imagine, you're sitting at home
watching television...

912
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:21,003
...and suddenly a commercial will flash
onto the screen, and a voice will say:

913
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:25,257
"Wonka's chocolates
are the best in the world.

914
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:28,343
If you don't believe us,
try one for yourself. "

915
01:28:29,345 --> 01:28:32,931
And you simply reach out and take it.

916
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:35,142
How about that?

917
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:37,227
So can you send other things?

918
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:39,187
Say, like, breakfast cereal?

919
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:42,149
Do you have any idea
what breakfast cereal's made of?

920
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:45,652
It's those little curly wooden shavings
you find in pencil sharpeners.

921
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,946
But could you send it by TV
if you wanted to?

922
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,240
- Of course I could.
- What about people?

923
01:28:50,616 --> 01:28:54,119
Well, why would I wanna send a person?
They don't taste very good at all.

924
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:57,497
Don't you realize what you've invented?
It's a teleporter.

925
01:28:57,707 --> 01:29:00,667
It's the most important invention
in the history of the world.

926
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:03,003
And all you think about is chocolate.

927
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:04,379
Calm down, Mike.

928
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:07,341
I think Mr. Wonka knows
what he's talking about.

929
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:09,926
No, he doesn't. He has no idea.

930
01:29:10,094 --> 01:29:12,220
You think he's a genius,
but he's an idiot.

931
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:14,890
But I'm not.

932
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:21,104
Hey, little boy.

933
01:29:22,398 --> 01:29:24,107
Don't push my button.

934
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:06,942
He's gone.

935
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:09,903
Let's go check the television,
see what we get.

936
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,448
I sure hope no part of him
gets left behind.

937
01:30:13,658 --> 01:30:14,866
What do you mean?

938
01:30:15,326 --> 01:30:19,746
Well, sometimes only half of
the little pieces find their way through.

939
01:30:20,915 --> 01:30:24,376
If you had to choose only one half
of your son, which one would it be?

940
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:26,586
What kind of a question is that?

941
01:30:27,380 --> 01:30:30,465
No need to snap. Just a question.

942
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:34,261
Try every channel.
I'm starting to feel a little anxious.

943
01:30:39,892 --> 01:30:41,685
- There he is.
- Mike.

944
01:30:42,353 --> 01:30:44,062
The most important thing

945
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:45,480
That we've ever learned

946
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:49,025
The most important thing we've learned
As far as children are concerned

947
01:30:49,193 --> 01:30:52,028
Is never, never let them near
The television set

948
01:30:52,196 --> 01:30:55,699
Or better still just don't install
The idiotic thing at all

949
01:30:56,701 --> 01:30:59,369
Never, never let them
Never, never let them

950
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:15,510
Never, never let them

951
01:31:15,678 --> 01:31:17,471
It rots the senses in the head

952
01:31:17,638 --> 01:31:18,847
It keeps imagination dead

953
01:31:19,015 --> 01:31:20,515
It clogs and clutters up the mind

954
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:22,309
It makes a child so dull and blind

955
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:23,852
So dull, so dull

956
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:27,022
He can no longer understand
A fairy tale, a fairyland

957
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:28,773
A fairyland, a fairyland

958
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:30,358
His brain becomes as soft as cheese

959
01:31:30,526 --> 01:31:32,027
His thinking powers rust and freeze

960
01:31:32,236 --> 01:31:35,447
He cannot think, he only sees

961
01:31:40,244 --> 01:31:43,205
Regarding little Mike Teavee

962
01:31:43,372 --> 01:31:45,999
We very much regret that we

963
01:31:46,542 --> 01:31:48,168
Regret that we

964
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:51,421
Shall simply have to wait and see

965
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:52,881
Wait and see, wait and see

966
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:55,383
Wait and see, wait and see, wait and see

967
01:31:55,551 --> 01:31:56,885
We very much regret that we

968
01:31:57,053 --> 01:31:58,720
Shall simply have to wait and see

969
01:31:58,888 --> 01:32:00,722
If we can get him back his height

970
01:32:00,890 --> 01:32:03,475
But if we can't

971
01:32:03,643 --> 01:32:04,684
It serves him right

972
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:06,394
Ew, somebody grab him.

973
01:32:06,562 --> 01:32:08,396
Help me.

974
01:32:09,106 --> 01:32:10,690
Help me.

975
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:14,736
Oh, thank heavens.
He's completely unharmed.

976
01:32:14,904 --> 01:32:18,448
Unharmed?
What are you talking about?

977
01:32:21,285 --> 01:32:23,703
Just put me back in the other way.

978
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:25,413
There is no other way.

979
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:28,625
It's television, not telephone.
There's quite a difference.

980
01:32:28,834 --> 01:32:31,836
And what exactly do you propose
to do about it?

981
01:32:32,004 --> 01:32:33,088
I don't know.

982
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:37,717
But young men are extremely springy.
They stretch like mad.

983
01:32:38,344 --> 01:32:41,429
- Let's go put him in the taffy puller.
- Taffy puller?

984
01:32:42,098 --> 01:32:43,431
Hey, that was my idea.

985
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,935
Boy, is he gonna be skinny.

986
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:49,563
Yeah.

987
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:51,982
Taffy puller.

988
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:55,443
I want you to take Mr. Teavee
and his...

989
01:32:56,821 --> 01:32:59,447
...little boy up to
the taffy puller, okay?

990
01:32:59,615 --> 01:33:01,408
Stretch him out.

991
01:33:12,211 --> 01:33:14,129
On with the tour.

992
01:33:23,014 --> 01:33:25,307
There's still so much left to see.

993
01:33:25,474 --> 01:33:28,018
Now, how many children are left?

994
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:35,150
Mr. Wonka,
Charlie's the only one left now.

995
01:33:37,403 --> 01:33:38,862
You mean, you're the only one?

996
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:41,448
Yes.

997
01:33:41,657 --> 01:33:42,991
What happened to the others?

998
01:33:47,538 --> 01:33:50,165
Oh, my dear boy,
but that means you've won.

999
01:33:50,374 --> 01:33:52,500
Oh, I do congratulate you. I really do.

1000
01:33:52,668 --> 01:33:54,002
I'm absolutely delighted.

1001
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:56,713
I had a hunch right from the beginning.
Well done.

1002
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:58,882
Now, we mustn't dilly or dally.

1003
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:02,093
We have an enormous number
of things to do before the day's out.

1004
01:34:02,261 --> 01:34:06,222
But luckily for us, we have the great
glass elevator to speed things along...

1005
01:34:12,688 --> 01:34:13,980
Speed things along.

1006
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:18,401
Come on.

1007
01:34:24,617 --> 01:34:26,910
"Up and Out"?
What kind of room is that?

1008
01:34:27,453 --> 01:34:29,120
Hold on.

1009
01:34:37,922 --> 01:34:39,547
Oh, my goodness.

1010
01:34:39,715 --> 01:34:43,385
We're gonna need to go much faster,
otherwise we'll just never break through.

1011
01:34:43,552 --> 01:34:45,095
Break through what?

1012
01:34:45,346 --> 01:34:47,764
I've been longing to press
that button for years.

1013
01:34:48,516 --> 01:34:51,267
Well, here we go. Up and out.

1014
01:34:51,602 --> 01:34:54,020
- But do you really mean...?
- Yeah. I do.

1015
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:55,689
But it's made of glass.

1016
01:34:55,856 --> 01:34:57,857
It'll smash into a million pieces.

1017
01:35:33,477 --> 01:35:36,396
Augustus, please
don't eat your fingers.

1018
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:38,481
But I taste so good.

1019
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:54,080
Look, Mother.
I'm much more flexible now.

1020
01:35:54,623 --> 01:35:57,125
Yes, but you're blue.

1021
01:36:19,607 --> 01:36:22,317
Daddy, I want a flying glass elevator.

1022
01:36:22,943 --> 01:36:26,404
Veruca, the only thing you're getting
today is a bath, and that's final.

1023
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:28,198
But I want it.

1024
01:36:45,174 --> 01:36:47,050
Where do you live?

1025
01:36:47,885 --> 01:36:50,053
Right over there. That little house.

1026
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:57,185
What time do you think
they'll be back?

1027
01:36:57,353 --> 01:36:59,062
Hard to know, dear.

1028
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:13,326
I think there's someone at the door.

1029
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:15,286
Hi, Mom.

1030
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,083
Mom. Dad. We're back.

1031
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:21,918
Charlie.
Charlie.

1032
01:37:23,295 --> 01:37:24,879
Goodness.

1033
01:37:26,715 --> 01:37:29,425
This is Willy Wonka.
He gave us a ride home.

1034
01:37:29,885 --> 01:37:31,302
I see that.

1035
01:37:31,470 --> 01:37:33,471
You must be the boy's...

1036
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:37,308
- Parents?
- Yeah. That.

1037
01:37:37,476 --> 01:37:40,395
He says Charlie's won something.

1038
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:43,231
Not just some something.

1039
01:37:43,607 --> 01:37:47,527
The most "something" something
of any something that's ever been.

1040
01:37:48,028 --> 01:37:50,864
I'm gonna give this little boy
my entire factory.

1041
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:55,076
You must be joking.

1042
01:37:55,244 --> 01:37:56,536
No, really. It's true.

1043
01:37:56,704 --> 01:38:00,164
Because you see, a few months ago,
I was having my semiannual haircut...

1044
01:38:00,332 --> 01:38:03,626
...and I had the strangest revelation.

1045
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:19,267
In that one silver hair...

1046
01:38:19,435 --> 01:38:21,978
...I saw reflected my life's work...

1047
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:25,565
...my factory,
my beloved Oompa-Loompas.

1048
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:28,651
Who would watch over them
after I was gone?

1049
01:38:28,819 --> 01:38:30,612
I realized in that moment:

1050
01:38:30,779 --> 01:38:33,281
I must find a heir.

1051
01:38:34,825 --> 01:38:36,951
And I did, Charlie.

1052
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:38,494
You.

1053
01:38:40,706 --> 01:38:42,790
That's why you sent out
the golden tickets.

1054
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:44,459
Uh-huh.

1055
01:38:44,668 --> 01:38:46,502
What are Oompa-Loompas?

1056
01:38:46,670 --> 01:38:48,671
I invited five children to the factory...

1057
01:38:48,839 --> 01:38:51,674
...and the one who was the least rotten
would be the winner.

1058
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:53,468
That's you, Charlie.

1059
01:38:53,928 --> 01:38:55,386
So, what do you say?

1060
01:38:55,554 --> 01:38:59,223
Are you ready to leave all this behind
and come live with me at the factory?

1061
01:38:59,391 --> 01:39:00,642
Sure. Of course.

1062
01:39:00,809 --> 01:39:03,478
I mean, it's all right
if my family come too?

1063
01:39:03,687 --> 01:39:05,939
Oh, my dear boy, of course they can't.

1064
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:08,483
You can't run a chocolate factory...

1065
01:39:08,692 --> 01:39:11,986
...with a family hanging over you
like an old, dead goose. No offense.

1066
01:39:12,196 --> 01:39:13,988
None taken, jerk.

1067
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:18,576
A chocolatier has to run free and solo.

1068
01:39:18,744 --> 01:39:21,704
He has to follow his dreams.
Gosh darn the consequences.

1069
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:24,457
Look at me.

1070
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:27,210
I had no family,
and I'm a giant success.

1071
01:39:28,504 --> 01:39:32,507
So if I go with you to the factory,
I won't ever see my family again?

1072
01:39:32,716 --> 01:39:35,051
Yeah. Consider that a bonus.

1073
01:39:37,721 --> 01:39:38,888
Then I'm not going.

1074
01:39:40,015 --> 01:39:42,225
I wouldn't give up my family
for anything.

1075
01:39:43,060 --> 01:39:44,978
Not for all the chocolate in the world.

1076
01:39:47,523 --> 01:39:49,649
Oh, I see.

1077
01:39:51,527 --> 01:39:53,444
That's weird.

1078
01:39:56,573 --> 01:39:59,242
There's other candy too
besides chocolate.

1079
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:03,079
I'm sorry, Mr. Wonka.
I'm staying here.

1080
01:40:05,874 --> 01:40:07,583
Wow.

1081
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:11,754
Well, that's just...

1082
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:14,465
...unexpected...

1083
01:40:16,051 --> 01:40:17,677
...and weird.

1084
01:40:24,768 --> 01:40:27,437
But I suppose, in that case, I'll just...

1085
01:40:29,857 --> 01:40:31,149
Goodbye, then.

1086
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:35,778
Sure you won't change your mind?

1087
01:40:38,407 --> 01:40:39,949
I'm sure.

1088
01:40:49,293 --> 01:40:51,294
Okay. Bye.

1089
01:41:12,941 --> 01:41:15,693
Things are going to get much better.

1090
01:41:16,612 --> 01:41:19,363
And for once, Grandma Georgina...

1091
01:41:19,531 --> 01:41:22,325
...knew exactly what
she was talking about.

1092
01:41:23,077 --> 01:41:27,455
The next morning, Charlie helped
his parents fix the hole in the roof.

1093
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:31,959
Grandpa Joe spent the whole day
out of bed.

1094
01:41:32,127 --> 01:41:33,961
He didn't feel tired at all.

1095
01:41:35,839 --> 01:41:39,342
Charlie's father got a better job
at the toothpaste factory...

1096
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:43,054
...repairing the machine
that had replaced him.

1097
01:41:44,848 --> 01:41:48,184
Things had never been better
for the Bucket family.

1098
01:41:48,519 --> 01:41:52,105
The same could not be said
for Willy Wonka.

1099
01:41:52,272 --> 01:41:54,482
I can't put my finger on it.

1100
01:41:54,942 --> 01:41:57,193
Candy's the only thing
I was ever certain of...

1101
01:41:57,361 --> 01:41:59,821
...and now I'm just not
certain at all.

1102
01:41:59,988 --> 01:42:02,782
I don't know which flavors to make
or which ideas to try.

1103
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:05,618
I'm second-guessing myself,
which is nuts.

1104
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:10,164
I've always made whatever candy
I felt like, and I...

1105
01:42:16,463 --> 01:42:18,422
That's just it, isn't it?

1106
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:23,136
I make the candy I feel like, but now
I feel terrible, so the candy's terrible.

1107
01:42:24,304 --> 01:42:26,889
You're very good.

1108
01:42:38,902 --> 01:42:40,820
Pity about that chocolate fellow,
Wendell... Walter.

1109
01:42:42,531 --> 01:42:44,574
- Willy Wonka.
- That's the one.

1110
01:42:45,284 --> 01:42:48,327
Says here in the paper his new candies
aren't selling very well.

1111
01:42:48,912 --> 01:42:52,540
But I suppose maybe he's just
a rotten egg who deserves it.

1112
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:55,585
- Yep.
- Oh, really?

1113
01:42:56,003 --> 01:42:58,045
You ever met him?

1114
01:42:58,213 --> 01:42:59,839
I did.

1115
01:43:00,007 --> 01:43:04,719
I thought he was great at first,
but then he didn't turn out so nice.

1116
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:07,346
He also has a funny haircut.

1117
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:08,848
I do not!

1118
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:12,727
- Why are you here?
- I don't feel so hot.

1119
01:43:13,187 --> 01:43:15,563
What makes you feel better
when you feel terrible?

1120
01:43:15,939 --> 01:43:17,356
My family.

1121
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:18,858
Ew.

1122
01:43:21,111 --> 01:43:22,945
What do you have against my family?

1123
01:43:23,697 --> 01:43:27,074
It's not just your family.
It's the whole idea of...

1124
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:32,413
They tell you what to do,
what not to do...

1125
01:43:32,581 --> 01:43:35,041
...and it's not conducive
to a creative atmosphere.

1126
01:43:35,626 --> 01:43:39,462
Usually they're just trying to protect you
because they love you.

1127
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:44,008
If you don't believe me,
you should ask.

1128
01:43:44,176 --> 01:43:47,136
Ask who? My father?

1129
01:43:47,554 --> 01:43:49,222
No way.

1130
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:51,474
At least, not by myself.

1131
01:43:52,976 --> 01:43:54,268
You want me to go with you?

1132
01:43:56,480 --> 01:44:00,775
Hey. Hey, what a good idea. Yeah!

1133
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:05,821
And you know what?
I've got transport...

1134
01:44:09,701 --> 01:44:12,995
I have to be more careful
where I park this thing.

1135
01:44:43,318 --> 01:44:45,861
I think we've got the wrong house.

1136
01:45:00,419 --> 01:45:01,877
Do you have an appointment?

1137
01:45:02,421 --> 01:45:04,547
No. But he's overdue.

1138
01:45:07,843 --> 01:45:09,844
Open.

1139
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:15,766
Now, let's see what the damage is,
shall we?

1140
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,850
Heavens.

1141
01:45:58,018 --> 01:46:01,187
I haven't seen bicuspids
like these since...

1142
01:46:05,233 --> 01:46:07,109
Since...

1143
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:17,620
Willy?

1144
01:46:19,456 --> 01:46:20,915
Hi, Dad.

1145
01:46:31,927 --> 01:46:34,178
All these years...

1146
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:37,056
...and you haven't flossed.

1147
01:46:39,142 --> 01:46:40,976
Not once.

1148
01:47:06,169 --> 01:47:07,586
It was on this day...

1149
01:47:07,796 --> 01:47:10,297
...that Willy Wonka
repeated his offer to Charlie...

1150
01:47:10,465 --> 01:47:13,217
...who accepted on one condition.

1151
01:47:13,385 --> 01:47:15,678
Sorry we're late.
We were brainstorming.

1152
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:17,805
Thought I heard thunder.

1153
01:47:17,973 --> 01:47:21,600
- You staying for dinner, Willy?
- Yes, please.

1154
01:47:22,060 --> 01:47:24,186
I'll shuffle the plates.

1155
01:47:32,737 --> 01:47:36,031
You smell like peanuts.

1156
01:47:36,408 --> 01:47:39,785
- I love peanuts.
- Oh, thank you.

1157
01:47:39,953 --> 01:47:41,620
You smell like...

1158
01:47:41,788 --> 01:47:43,622
...old people and soap.

1159
01:47:46,501 --> 01:47:48,210
I like it.

1160
01:47:52,799 --> 01:47:55,301
Elbows off the table, Charlie.

1161
01:47:55,469 --> 01:47:57,845
How do you feel about
little raspberry kites?

1162
01:47:58,013 --> 01:47:59,555
With licorice instead of string.

1163
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:04,143
- Boys, no business at the dinner table.
- Sorry, Mom.

1164
01:48:04,728 --> 01:48:07,730
I think you're on to something,
though, Charlie.

1165
01:48:19,493 --> 01:48:23,871
In the end Charlie Bucket
won a chocolate factory.

1166
01:48:25,248 --> 01:48:29,919
But Willy Wonka got something
even better:

1167
01:48:30,545 --> 01:48:33,047
A family.

1168
01:48:34,382 --> 01:48:38,552
And one thing was absolutely certain:

1169
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:42,973
Life had never been sweeter.
