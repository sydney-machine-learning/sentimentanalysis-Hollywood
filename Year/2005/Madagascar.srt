1
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,000
Surprise!

2
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,240
Alex. Do not interrupt me
when I'm daydreaming.

3
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,480
When a zebra's in the zone,
leave him alone.

4
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,320
Come on, Marty. Just wanted
to wish you a happy birthday.

5
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,440
Hey, man, thanks.

6
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,200
Hey, I got something
stuck in my teeth.

7
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,960
It's driving me crazy.
Can you help me? Please?

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,240
You came to the right place, my friend.

9
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,240
Dr. Marty, D.D.S., is in the house.

10
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,160
Please hop on top of my sterilized
examination table, if you may.

11
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,240
- I don't see anything.
- It's on the left.

12
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,480
Oh, sorry.

13
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,040
Okay, just don't talk
with your mouth full.

14
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,440
Right here. What the heck
is this doing in there?

15
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,880
Happy birthday!

16
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,240
Aw, hey, thanks, man.

17
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,320
You put it in behind the tooth.
You all right.

18
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,320
These aren't even on the shelf yet.
Here. Check it out.

19
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:14,840
- Look at that. Ooh! Look at that.
- Look at that. It's snowing.

20
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,280
Ten years old, huh? A decade.

21
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,560
Double digits. The big 1-0.

22
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,240
You don't like it?

23
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,480
- No, no, it's great.
- You hate it.

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,160
I should've gotten you the Alex
alarm clock. That's the big seller.

25
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,040
No, no, no.
The present's great, really.

26
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,680
It's just that
another year's come and gone

27
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,720
and I'm still doing
the same old thing.

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,440
"Stand over here. Trot over there.
Eat some grass. Walk back over here."

29
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,160
- I see your problem.
- Maybe I should go to law school.

30
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,800
You just need to break out
of that boring routine.

31
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,720
- How?
- Throw out the old act.

32
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,920
Who knows what you'll do.
Make it up as you go along.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,560
Ad lib. Improvise. On the fly.
Boom, boom, boom.

34
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,800
- Really?
- You know, make it fresh.

35
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,160
Fresh, huh? Okay.
I could do fresh.

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Works for me.

37
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,240
Here come the people, Marty.
I love the people.

38
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,960
It's fun people fun time!

39
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,680
Let's go, Gloria!
Up and at 'em. We're open!

40
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,640
What day is it?

41
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,040
It's Friday. Field trip day.

42
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,200
Yes, it's field trip day.
Let's get up and go...

43
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,960
...in ten more minutes.

44
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,800
Come on!

45
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,640
Melman, Melman, Melman!
Melman, Melman, Melman!

46
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,800
Wake up! Rise and shine! It's another
fabulous morning in the Big Apple.

47
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,160
Let's go.

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,080
- Not for me. I'm calling in sick.
- What?

49
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,000
I found another brown spot
on my shoulder. Right here. See?

50
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,000
Right there. You see?

51
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,080
Melman, you know
it's all in your head. Hm?

52
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,920
Let's go! Come on!

53
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:02,120
Phil! Wake up, you filthy monkey.

54
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,440
Oh, I'm going to be fresh.

55
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,160
Straight out the ground.
Tasty fresh! Freshalicious.

56
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,360
Ziploc fresh.

57
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
children of all ages,

58
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,280
the Central Park Zoo
proudly presents:

59
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,120
Show them the cat. Who's the cat?

60
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,400
The king of New York City.

61
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,880
Alex the lion.

62
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,040
It's showtime.

63
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,400
Roar!

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,600
Gather around, people.
Big show about to start.

65
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,240
Check out the zebra
taking care of biz. That's right.

66
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,800
Just smile and wave, boys.

67
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,640
Smile and wave.

68
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,800
Kowalski, progress report.

69
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,440
We're 500 feet from the main sewer line.

70
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,400
- And the bad news?
- We've broken our last shovel.

71
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,720
Right.

72
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,200
Rico, you're on litter patrol.
We need shovels.

73
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,600
And find more Popsicle sticks.
We don't want to risk another cave-in.

74
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,880
And me, skipper?

75
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,880
I want you to look
cute and cuddly, private.

76
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,240
Today we're going to blow this dump.

77
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,840
Come here. Come here.
Come on, penguin.

78
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,480
Yeah! You don't
see that on Animal Planet.

79
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,200
Ha-ha.

80
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,040
Well, show's over, folks.
Thanks for coming.

81
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,360
I hope you thought it was fresh.

82
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,880
I'll be here all week.

83
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,440
In fact, I'll be here
for my whole life.

84
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,760
Three hundred
and sixty-five days a year,

85
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,640
including Christmas,
Hanukkah, Halloween, Kwanzaa.

86
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,120
Please don't forget
to never spay or neuter your pets.

87
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,960
And tip your cabbie,
because he's broke.

88
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,400
You, quadruped.
Sprechen sie Englisch?

89
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,000
I sprechen.

90
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,080
- What continent is this?
- Manhattan.

91
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,960
Hoover Dam! We're still in New York.

92
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,160
Abort. Dive! Dive! Dive.

93
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,400
Hey. You in the tux. Wait a minute.

94
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,840
What are you guys doing?

95
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,640
We're digging to Antarctica.

96
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,800
Ant-who-tica?

97
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,320
Can you keep a secret,
my monochromatic friend?

98
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,360
Do you ever see any penguins
running free around New York City?

99
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,320
Of course not. We don't belong here.
It's just not natural.

100
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,560
This is all some kind
of whacked-out conspiracy.

101
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,480
We're going to the
wide-open spaces of Antarctica.

102
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,920
To the wild.

103
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,160
The wild?
You could actually go there?

104
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,520
That sounds great.

105
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,040
Hey, hold up. Where is this place?
Tell me where it is.

106
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,520
You didn't see anything.

107
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
Right?

108
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,280
Yes, sir.

109
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,960
I'm sorry. No, sir.

110
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,320
For his final appearance of the day,

111
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,360
the king of New York City.

112
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,040
Alex the lion.

113
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,840
Roar!

114
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,320
Thank you. Thank you very much.

115
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,880
You guys are great. You're a
great crowd. Give yourselves a hand.

116
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,160
Thank you. Oh. Thank you.

117
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,880
Oh! Well. Thank you.

118
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,200
Oh, that's too kind. Too kind.

119
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,840
Underpants!

120
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Everybody get home safe. Hey!
Check out my Web site.

121
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,480
Twenty-four hour Alex Cam.
Watch me sleep.

122
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,400
This is the life.

123
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,480
That's the spot.

124
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,320
Oh! I'm in heaven.

125
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,400
- Ooh, it's Marty's birthday.
- Just rip it open.

126
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,480
- What is it?
- Come on. Open it up. What you got?

127
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,800
A thermometer.

128
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,600
Thanks. I love it, Melman. I love it.

129
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,920
I wanted to give you something personal.
That was my first rectal thermometer.

130
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
- Mother...
- I'll miss that bad boy.

131
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,680
Get the cake. Melman, come on.

132
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,040
Happy birthday to you

133
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,960
You live in a zoo

134
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,280
You look like a monkey

135
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,040
And you smell like one too

136
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,120
I say.

137
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,560
Aw, well, now, you guys
are just embarrassing me.

138
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,880
And yourselves.

139
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,240
What? We worked
on that all week.

140
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,000
Let's go.
Let's make a wish, babycakes.

141
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,240
- What'd you wish for?
- Nope. Can't tell you that.

142
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,400
Come on. Tell.

143
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,720
No siree.
I'm telling you, it's bad luck.

144
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,040
You want some bad luck,
I'll blab it out.

145
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,840
But if you want to be safe,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

146
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,360
Would you just tell us?
What could happen?

147
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,640
Okay.

148
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,840
I wished I could go to the wild!

149
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,080
The wild?!

150
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,280
I told you it was bad luck.

151
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,840
The wild? Are you nuts?

152
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,840
That is the worst idea
I've ever heard.

153
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,520
It's unsanitary.

154
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,560
The penguins are going.
So why can't I?

155
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,080
The penguins are psychotic.

156
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,400
Come on. Just imagine
going back to nature.

157
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,320
Back to your roots.
Clean air, wide-open spaces!

158
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,760
I hear there's
wide-open spaces in Connecticut.

159
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,040
- Connecticut?
- You got to go over to Grand Central.

160
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,240
Then you got to take
the Metro-North train... north?

161
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,360
So one could take the train?
Just hypothetically.

162
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,240
Come on. What would
Connecticut have to offer us?

163
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,120
- Lyme disease.
- Thank you, Melman.

164
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,360
No, I just want...

165
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,280
There's none of this in the wild.

166
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,600
This is a highly
refined type of food thing

167
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,440
that you do not find in the wild.

168
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,600
You ever thought there might
be more to life than steak, Alex?

169
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,400
He didn't mean that, baby.
No, no, no.

170
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,200
Doesn't it bother you guys
that you don't know anything

171
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,360
about life outside this zoo?

172
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,360
- Nuh-uh. Nope.
- Mm-mm.

173
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,920
Well, I mean, come on.
That's just one subject.

174
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,560
You got a little schmutz
right there on your...

175
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,200
Thanks, guys.
Thanks for the party. It was great.

176
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,440
Really.

177
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,080
What's eating him?

178
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,920
Maybe you should talk to him.
Go over and give him a little pep talk.

179
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,680
Hey, I already gave him
a snow globe. I can't top that.

180
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,800
I can see where this is going.

181
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,360
It is getting late.
I guess I'm going to...

182
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,400
Come on. He's your best friend.

183
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,360
All right, all right. Okay.

184
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,920
- Night, Marty.
- Night, Glo.

185
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,560
What a day.

186
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,120
I mean, I tell you, it just doesn't
get any better than this, you know?

187
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Ooh! It just did. Even the star's out.

188
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,240
Not going to find a star
like that in the wild.

189
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Helicopter.

190
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,680
Marty. Buddy. Listen.

191
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,680
Everybody has days when they think the
grass might be greener somewhere else.

192
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,840
Alex.

193
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,080
Look at me.

194
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,040
I'm ten years old.
My life is half over.

195
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:51,760
And I don't even know
if I'm black with white stripes...

196
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,800
...or white with black stripes.

197
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,400
Marty.

198
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,680
I'm thinking of a song.

199
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,520
Alex. Please. Not now.

200
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,320
Oh, yes. It's a wonderful song.
I think you're familiar with it.

201
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,360
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.
No, no, no.

202
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,920
I'm not listening.

203
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,400
Start spreadin' the news

204
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,520
I don't know you.

205
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,160
I'm leaving today

206
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,760
- We are a great big part of it
- He's funny. Who is that?

207
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,160
Come on. You know
you know the words.

208
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
Two little words.

209
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,480
New York.

210
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,080
New York

211
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,160
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Hey, I'm sleeping here!

212
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,000
We're not all nocturnal, you know!

213
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,520
I'll knock your "turnal" right off, pal.

214
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,720
Yeah, you and what army, stripes?

215
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,560
You mess with him,
you mess with me, Howard.

216
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,120
- You're a bigmouth lion.
- See? Mr. Grumpy Stripes.

217
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,400
We make a great team, the two of us.

218
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,040
We sure do. No doubt about it.

219
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,560
So, what are you going to do? Go
running off to the wild by yourself?

220
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,600
- No.
- Good.

221
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,240
You and me. Let's go.

222
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,400
- What?
- The wild.

223
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,680
Come on. You and me together.

224
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,040
It's a straight shot
down Fifth Avenue to Grand Central.

225
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,000
We'll grab a train, we'll head north.

226
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,640
We can be back by morning.
No one will ever know.

227
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,840
You're joking. Right?

228
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,120
Yeah. I'm joking. Of course
I'm joking. Give me a break.

229
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,760
Like we're going to get a train.

230
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,880
Don't do that. You really
had me worried there.

231
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:32,760
Oh, well. I guess I'll hit the sack.

232
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,240
Yeah, me too. I'll need
to rest my voice for tomorrow.

233
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,840
It's Seniors' Day, you know.
Have to roar extra loud.

234
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,640
Give them a little jolt. You know?

235
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,680
Good night, Ally Al.

236
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,800
They forgot to turn off
the ambience again.

237
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Don't worry. It's cool.

238
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,200
You know, I got it.

239
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,680
Much better.

240
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,000
Come on, now, baby.

241
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,080
My little filet.

242
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,240
My little filet mignon
with a little fat around the edges.

243
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,080
I like that. I like
a little fat on my steak.

244
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,240
My sweet, juicy steak.
You are a rare delicacy.

245
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,960
Alex. Alex. Alex!

246
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,240
What? What?

247
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,400
You suck your thumb?

248
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,280
What is it, Melman?

249
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,160
You know how I have
that bladder infection

250
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,000
and I have to get up
every two hours?

251
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:04,240
I got up to pee and looked over at
Marty's pen, which I usually don't do.

252
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,160
I don't know why, but I did. And...

253
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,680
What? What's going on?

254
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,480
It's Marty. He's gone.

255
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,080
Gone! What do you mean, "gone"?

256
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,720
How long has he been working on this?

257
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,000
Marty!

258
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,360
Marty!

259
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,120
He wouldn't fit down there.

260
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,880
Marty? Marty! Marty!

261
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,440
This doesn't make any sense.
Where would he go?

262
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,800
- Connecticut!
- He wouldn't.

263
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,720
Oh, no! What are we going to do?

264
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,160
I mean, we got to call somebody!

265
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,600
Hello? Get me Missing Animals.
And hurry.

266
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,280
We've got a lost zebra probably on
the way to Connecticut, and we need...

267
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,240
- Hello? Hello?
- Wait a second.

268
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,680
- We can't call the people.
- What the...?

269
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,760
They'll be really mad.

270
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,360
It'll get Marty transferred for good.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

271
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,800
Mm-hm, I know that's right.

272
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,360
We got to go after him.
He's not thinking straight.

273
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,280
Let's stop him from making
the biggest mistake of his life.

274
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,240
He's probably out there
lost and cold, confused.

275
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,800
Poor little guy.

276
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Come on.

277
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,440
One of us should wait here
in case he comes back.

278
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,600
Not now. This is an intervention.
We all got to go.

279
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,760
What's the fastest way
to Grand Central?

280
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,760
- You should take Lexington.
- Melman!

281
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,280
- Okay. "We." We should take Lexington.
- What about Park?

282
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,840
No, Park goes two ways.
You can't time the lights.

283
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,640
I heard Tom Wolfe
is speaking at Lincoln Center.

284
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,280
Well, of course we're
going to throw poo at him.

285
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,920
We should've taken Park.

286
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You sure this is the fastest way
to Grand Central Station?

287
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,080
I don't know!
That's what Melman said.

288
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,640
Hey. Hey, you, guys.

289
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,280
That room has some nifty little
sinks you can wash up in, and look!

290
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,000
Free mints!

291
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,440
This isn't a field trip.

292
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:25,880
This is an urgent mission to save
Marty from throwing his life away.

293
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,400
Now, where's the train?

294
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,080
Here it comes.

295
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,760
What did Marty say to you?
I asked you to talk to him.

296
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,240
I did! I did! I don't understand.
He said, "Let's go."

297
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,160
I said, "Are you crazy?"
He says, "I'm ten years old."

298
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,880
And he has black-and-white stripes,
and so then we sang and...

299
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,320
What you got to do is go
straight back down West 42nd.

300
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,520
It's on your left after Vanderbilt.

301
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,720
If you hit the Chrysler Building,
you've gone too far.

302
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,240
Thanks a lot, officer.

303
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,280
Hey! Wait for the light.

304
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,280
Freak.

305
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,000
- Did you say "zebra"?
- That's right. A zebra.

306
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,440
Right in front of me.

307
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,960
- Can I shoot it?
- Negative.

308
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,520
Then I'm going to need some backup.

309
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,800
- Aw! Knicks lost again.
- What are you going to do.

310
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,160
Did that say "Grand Central
Station" or "my aunt's constipation"?

311
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,200
This is it.

312
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,520
Grand Central Station.

313
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,880
It's grand and it's central.

314
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,600
Move aside. We have an emergency here.
This is an emergency situation.

315
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,360
Hey, hey. Just chill out.
It's not that big of an emergency.

316
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,800
Upstairs, downstairs.

317
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,720
How do you like that?

318
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,280
Lady! What is wrong with you?

319
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,320
Ow! Get a grip on yourselves, people.

320
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,800
You're a bad kitty.

321
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,320
Dagnabbit! I missed the express.

322
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,200
Looks like I'll have
to take the Stamford local.

323
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,920
I got him! I've got him!

324
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,040
He's got him!

325
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,280
He's got him!
He's got him! He's got...

326
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,720
I got something for you!

327
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,600
I'm okay. I'm okay.

328
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,040
Whoa! What are
you guys doing here?

329
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,720
- I am so glad we found you.
- We were so worried about you.

330
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,040
Don't worry, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Look at me. I'm fine.

331
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,040
You're fine? Oh, he's fine. Oh, great.

332
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,720
You hear that? Marty's fine.
That's good to know.

333
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,360
Because I was wondering...

334
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,360
How could you do this to us?
I thought we were your friends!

335
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,600
What's the big deal?
I was coming back.

336
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,720
Don't ever do this again.
Do you hear me?

337
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,400
- Do you hear him?
- Guys, we're running out of time.

338
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,280
Oh, Melman, you broke their clock?

339
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,640
...do this again! Don't you ever,
ever do this again!

340
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,120
Come here.

341
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,600
We've been ratted out, boys.

342
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,160
Hold your fire!

343
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,840
Cute and cuddly, boys.
Cute and cuddly.

344
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,880
If you have any poo, fling it now.

345
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,960
It's the Man.

346
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,000
Good evening, officers.

347
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,160
No. No. No. You don't talk now. Okay?

348
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,680
You're not good with the
"putting words together

349
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,360
and their coming out good" thing.
You keep it "shh."

350
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,800
Hey! How you doing?
You know what? Everything's cool.

351
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,560
We just had a little situation here.
Little internal situation.

352
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,480
My friend went a little crazy.
Happens to everybody.

353
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,480
The city gets to us all.
Went a little cuckoo in the head.

354
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,400
Don't be calling me
cuckoo in the head.

355
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,200
Just shush! I will handle this.

356
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,480
Oh! I got him!

357
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,400
Go, go, go! Right here, please.

358
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,480
Would you give a guy a break?

359
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,920
We'll take my little friend home and
forget this ever happened. All right?

360
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,240
No harm, no foul, right?

361
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,520
Hey, it's cool. It's me,
Alex the lion. From the zoo.

362
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,600
What's the matter with them?

363
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,400
I feel really, really weird.

364
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,800
I love you guys.

365
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,440
I love you so much.

366
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,960
Last night's dramatic incident
in Grand Central

367
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,760
is an example of what animal rights
wackos have been shouting for years:

368
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,720
Animals clearly
don't belong in captivity.

369
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,680
They are to be sent back
to their natural habitat,

370
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,080
where they will live their lives
in the freedom they desire.

371
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,040
- Hey. Little help?
- He's awake! He's awake!

372
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,840
Do something!

373
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,320
Oh, man.

374
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,200
Oh, my head.

375
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,000
What the...?

376
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,400
Wait. Where? What?

377
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,720
I'm in a box! Oh, no.
No, no! Not the box.

378
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,240
Oh, no, they can't
transfer me. Not me!

379
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,160
Oh, I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

380
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,120
Darkness creeping in.

381
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,360
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

382
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,480
Walls closing in around me.

383
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,720
So alone. So alone.

384
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,600
- Alex! Alex, are you there?
- Marty?

385
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,800
- Yeah! Talk to me, buddy.
- Oh, Marty! You're here!

386
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,600
- What's going on? You okay?
- This doesn't look good.

387
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,640
- Alex, Marty, is that you?
- Gloria!

388
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,680
- You're here too!
- I am loving the sound of your voice.

389
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,920
- What is going on?
- We're all in crates.

390
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,080
Oh, no!

391
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,640
- Sleeping just knocks me out.
- Melman!

392
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,760
Is that Melman?

393
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,440
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

394
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,240
I often doze off
while I'm getting an MRI.

395
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,040
- You're not getting an MRI.
- CAT scan?

396
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,840
No CAT scan. It's a transfer.
It's a zoo transfer.

397
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,240
Zoo transfer?! Oh, no.
No, no, I can't be transferred.

398
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,800
I have an appointment
with Dr. Goldberg at 5:00.

399
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,400
There are prescriptions
that have to be filled.

400
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,960
No other zoo could
afford my medical care.

401
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,560
And I am not going HMO.

402
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,280
Take it easy, Melman.
It's going to be okay.

403
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:08,760
- We are going to be okizay.
- No, we're not going to be okizay.

404
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,880
Now, because of you, we're ruined!

405
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,320
Because of me? I fail
to see how this is my fault.

406
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,680
- You're kidding, right, Marty?
- You. You ticked off the people.

407
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,160
You bit the hand, Marty.
You bit the hand.

408
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,560
"I don't know who I am. I got to go
find myself in the wild." Oh, please.

409
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,760
I did not ask you
to come after me, did I?

410
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,400
He does have a point.

411
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,440
I did say we should stay at the zoo,
but you guys...

412
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,600
Melman, just shut it.

413
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,240
You suggested this idea
to him in the first place.

414
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,680
- Leave Melman out of this.
- Thank you, Gloria.

415
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:41,480
Besides, it's not my fault
that we were transferred.

416
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,200
Melman, shut it.
Does anybody feel nauseous?

417
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,960
- I feel nauseous.
- Melman, you always feel nauseous.

418
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,480
Progress report.

419
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,600
It's an older code, skipper.
I can't make it out.

420
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,720
You, higher mammal.

421
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,160
Can you read?

422
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,240
No. Phil can read, though. Phil.

423
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,280
Ship to Kenya.

424
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,880
Wildlife preserve.

425
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,000
Africa!

426
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,120
Africa? That ain't going to fly. Rico.

427
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,520
I was the star
in the greatest city on Earth.

428
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,960
- Guys, listen.
- A king. Loved by my people.

429
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,600
- Let's be civil.
- And you've ruined everything!

430
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,720
"Loved"?

431
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,840
If the people loved you, it's only
because they didn't know the real you!

432
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,840
Don't make me come up there.
I'll whoop both of y'all.

433
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,360
I thought I knew the real you!

434
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:21,120
Your black-and-white stripes, they
cancel each other out. You're nothing!

435
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,760
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

436
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,880
You're not helping the situation.

437
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,640
Status.

438
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,800
It's no good.
I don't know the codes.

439
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,440
Don't give me excuses.
Give me results! Navigation.

440
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,960
All right. Let me think.

441
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,560
And shut him up!

442
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,800
- I did it!
- Let's get this tin can turned around.

443
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,360
Guys?

444
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,440
Oh, no.

445
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,720
Gloria!

446
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,000
Melman!

447
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Marty!

448
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,840
Alex!

449
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,360
Marty?!

450
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,040
Alex!

451
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,360
Marty!

452
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,280
No, wait. Come back, Marty!

453
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,280
Don't go.

454
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,560
Marty?

455
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,960
Melman?

456
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,520
Gloria?

457
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,360
Marty?!

458
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,640
Melman?!

459
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,160
Gloria?!

460
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,320
Marty!

461
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,280
Melman! Gloria!

462
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,920
Hey, anyone! Hello!

463
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,120
Marty, Melman, Gloria.

464
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,080
Gloria, Melman, Marty.
Marty, Gelman, Gloria. Marty, Melman.

465
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,600
Morty, Morty, Gelman. Regis. Kelly.

466
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,480
Matt, Katie, Al.

467
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,920
Get me out of this thing.
Somebody. Hello?

468
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,920
Get me out of this thing right now!

469
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,360
Hello? Somebody?

470
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,680
Melman!

471
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,520
Alex? Is that you?

472
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:16,440
Melman, I got you. Hang on!
Hang on. I got you.

473
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,920
Melman! I got you, buddy.

474
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,800
Wait a sec, Melman.
Wait right there.

475
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,160
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting you out of the box.

476
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,640
- Relax.
- Alex?

477
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,120
Giraffe, corner pocket!

478
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,320
Here goes nothing!

479
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,440
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Hold still!

480
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,040
- Wait, Alex.
- Hold still.

481
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,080
- No, come on.
- Here I come!

482
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,960
Look! Look! Look! Look!

483
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,960
It's Gloria. It's Gloria!

484
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,240
Oh, hey, it is Gloria.

485
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,360
Oh, my...

486
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,760
Gloria!

487
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,640
Gloria!

488
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,080
Alrighty, boys, fun's over.

489
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,200
Gloria!

490
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,680
Alex!

491
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,880
- Marty?!
- Marty!

492
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Yeah! All right! That's right!

493
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,840
Left! Left! Left. No, no,
your left! Your left! Your left!

494
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,400
Right here's good.

495
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,360
I don't have anything on me
right now. I'll have to get you later.

496
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,480
To you too.

497
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,000
Marty!

498
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,360
Marty!

499
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,400
Alex!

500
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,640
Marty!

501
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,200
Alex!

502
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,560
Marty!

503
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,840
Al!

504
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,160
Marty!

505
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
Alex?

506
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,720
Marty!

507
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,840
Oh, sugar, honey, ice tea.

508
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,920
Martin!

509
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,680
- Hold up!
- I'm going to kill you!

510
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,520
- Come here! Don't run away from me!
- Calm down!

511
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,480
If you keep running,
I'm going to just kill you more!

512
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,840
Oh, look at us.

513
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,160
We're all here together.
Safe and sound.

514
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,120
Yeah, here we are.

515
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,920
Where exactly is "here"?

516
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,680
San Diego.

517
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,240
San Diego?

518
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,800
White sandy beaches,

519
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,880
cleverly simulated natural
environment, wide-open enclosures.

520
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,880
I'm telling you,
this could be the San Diego Zoo.

521
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,000
Complete with fake rocks.

522
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,760
Wow, that looks real.

523
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,880
San Diego? What could
be worse than San Diego?

524
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,960
I don't know.
This place is crackalacking!

525
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,080
Oh, I could hang here.
I could hang here.

526
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,720
- I'll kill you!
- Take it easy!

527
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,360
- Strangle you!
- Calm down.

528
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,400
Then bury you, dig you up,
clone you and kill your clones.

529
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:18,200
- 20-second timeout.
- I'll never talk to you again.

530
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,640
Now, look. We're just
going to find the people,

531
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,080
get checked in
and have this mess straightened out.

532
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,720
Oh, great.
This is just great. San Diego.

533
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,560
Now I'll have to compete
with Shamu and his smug little grin.

534
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,600
I can't top that. Can't top it.

535
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:38,080
I'm ruined! I'm done.
I'm out of the business.

536
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,240
It's your fault, Marty!
You've ruined me.

537
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,880
Come on, Alex.
Do you honestly think

538
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,200
I intended all of this to happen?

539
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,080
You want me to say that I'm sorry?
Is that what you want?

540
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,080
Okay, I'm...

541
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,640
He just shushed me.

542
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,720
Marty, look, you've got
to be just a little bit more und...

543
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,000
- Don't you shush me.
- Do you hear that? Don't you hear that?

544
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,600
- I hear it now.
- Where there's music, there's people.

545
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,120
- Go to the head honcho.
- A sidewalk would be nice.

546
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,680
Yeah, what a dump.

547
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,960
They should call it
the San Di-lame-o Zoo.

548
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,000
First they tell you, "We got this great
open plan thing. Let animals run wild."

549
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:20,520
Next thing, flowers in your hair,
everybody's hugging everybody.

550
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,800
This place kind of grows on you.
This way, guys! Come on!

551
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,520
What the...?

552
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,960
Oh, no!

553
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,880
Okay, let's make
a good impression on the people.

554
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,800
Smiles, everyone.
Let's get it together.

555
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,240
- Is that the best you can do?
- Oh, I'm not smiling. It's gas.

556
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,520
Well, great. Let's make gas look good.

557
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,440
- Wow!
- It's not people. It's animals.

558
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,760
California animals. Dude.

559
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,520
This is like a Puffy party.

560
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,600
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it

561
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,600
- Ya like to
- Move it

562
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,040
I like to move it, move it
I like to move it, move it

563
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,800
I like to move it, move it

564
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,760
- Ya like to
- Move it

565
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:32,080
I like to move it, move it
You like to move it, move it

566
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,800
She like to move it, move it

567
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,320
- He like to
- Move it

568
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,880
All girls all over the world

569
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,080
Original King Julien
'pon yer case, man

570
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,440
I love how all the girls
that love to move their body

571
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,400
When ya move your body, ya do

572
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,560
Move it nice
and sweet and sassy, all right

573
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,000
What kind of zoo is this?

574
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,320
I just saw 26 blatant
health code violations.

575
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,320
I'm loving San Diego.
This place is off the chizain.

576
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,400
Twenty-seven.

577
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,840
Woman, physically fit, physically fit

578
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,640
Physically, physically, physically fit
Physically fit, Physically fit

579
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,880
We should've brought chips and dip.

580
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,120
Wait.

581
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,840
Where's Alex? What happened to him?
He was right behind us. Wasn't he?

582
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,120
I don't know where he's at,
but he's missing one heck of a party.

583
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,800
The fossa!

584
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,200
The fossa!

585
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,880
The fossa are attacking!
Run for your lives!

586
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,240
- Fossa hungry.
- Fossa eat.

587
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,160
I hate spiderwebs.

588
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,080
Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.

589
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,200
Thanks for waiting up.
Really appreciate it.

590
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,840
Hey, hi. We just got in from New York,
and we're looking for a supervisor.

591
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,080
Because we've been sitting
on that beach back there for hours,

592
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,480
and nobody's even bothered to show up.

593
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,800
I don't know how things
are normally run around here,

594
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,840
but there's been some sort
of major screwup, which is cool.

595
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,640
So if you could point us towards
the administrative offices, we'll...

596
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,640
Well, howdy-do.

597
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,840
Spider! Spider! Spider on my back!

598
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,880
Maurice, did you see that?

599
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,080
He scared the fossa away.

600
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,120
Come on, Gloria. Get it.

601
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,960
Get it! Get it! Get it!

602
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,520
- That's it! Smack it!
- Get it, get it!

603
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,680
Whip it! Whip it good!
Where'd it go?

604
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,760
King Julien, what are they?
What are they?!

605
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:37,600
They are aliens. Savage aliens
from the savage future.

606
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,960
They've come to kill us. And take
our women. And our precious metals.

607
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,520
Get up, Mort. Do not
be near the king's feet, okay?

608
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,960
We're hiding. Be quiet,
everyone. Including me.

609
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,680
Who's making that noise?

610
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,880
Oh, it's me again.

611
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,120
There it is! Get it! Come on, Gloria!

612
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,320
- Enough! Enough with the stick.
- I think she got it.

613
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,760
Is it still on me? I hate spiders.

614
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,880
It's okay. It's gone.

615
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,400
They are savages.

616
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,640
Tonight we die.

617
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,680
The feet. I told you...
I told you to... I told every...

618
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,600
Didn't I tell him about the feet?

619
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,680
He did tell you about the feet.

620
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,000
- Wait. I have a plan.
- Really?

621
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,360
I have devised a cunning test

622
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,000
to see whether
these are savage killers.

623
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,240
Hi there.

624
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,640
You let me handle it.
Alex handles it. Marty does nothing.

625
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,240
Hi there.

626
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,120
Oh, jeez. Sorry.

627
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,200
- Oh, Alex, what'd you do?
- Stop. Stop. It's okay. It's okay.

628
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,760
I'm just a silly... Just a silly lion.
Oh, jeez!

629
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,720
- Aw, Alex!
- Oh, you poor little baby.

630
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,320
Did that big mean lion scare you?

631
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,640
He did? He's a big,
bad old puddy tat, isn't he?

632
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,760
Come on. Mama'll hold you.
Awww, look at you.

633
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,000
They are so cute
from a reasonable distance.

634
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,360
Aren't you the sweetest little thing.
I just want to dunk him in my coffee.

635
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,200
They're just a bunch of pansies.

636
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,520
I don't know.

637
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,400
There's something
about that one with the crazy hairdo

638
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,480
that I find suspicious.

639
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,040
Nonsense, Maurice.

640
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:34,040
Come on, everybody.
Let's go and meet the pansies!

641
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,600
Presenting your royal highness,
our illustrious King Julien XIII,

642
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,120
self-proclaimed lord of the lemurs,
et cetera. Hooray, everybody.

643
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,160
He's got style.

644
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,120
What is he, like,
king of the guinea pigs?

645
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,480
I think it's a squirrel.

646
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,560
Welcome, giant pansies.

647
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,280
Please feel free to bask in my glow.

648
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,680
- Definitely a squirrel.
- Yep. Squirrel.

649
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,920
We thank you with enormous gratitude
for chasing away the fossa.

650
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,960
- The "whossa"?
- The fossa.

651
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,880
They annoy us by trespassing,
interrupting our parties

652
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,800
- and ripping our limbs off.
- Good.

653
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,720
We're just trying to find out
where the people are, so...

654
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,840
What big teeth you have. Man!

655
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,000
Shame on you, Maurice. Can you not
see that you have insulted the freak?

656
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,000
You must tell me,
who the heck are you?

657
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,000
I'm Alex. The Alex.
And this is Gloria, Marty and Melman.

658
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,200
And just where are you giants from?

659
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,280
We're from New York and...

660
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,920
All hail the New York giants!

661
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,160
New York giants!

662
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,520
Is this some sort of
inbreeding program?

663
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,560
I say we just got to ask these
bozos where the people are.

664
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,840
Excuse me. We bozos
have the people, of course.

665
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,840
Hey, the bozos have the people.

666
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,280
Oh, well, great. Good. Phew.

667
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,760
They're up there.

668
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,280
Don't you love the people?
Not a very lively bunch, though.

669
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,400
Wow.

670
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,120
So do you have any live people?

671
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,880
No. Only dead ones.

672
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,800
I mean, if we had
a lot of live people here,

673
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,280
it wouldn't be called
the wild, would it?

674
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,600
The wild?

675
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,640
Whoa. Hold up there
a second, fuzzbucket.

676
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,000
You mean, like,

677
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,440
the "live in a mud hut, wipe
yourself with a leaf" type wild?

678
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,000
- Who wipes?
- Oy vey.

679
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,760
- Oy vey!
- Oy vey, everybody!

680
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,680
Oy vey!

681
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,000
Could you excuse me
for a moment?

682
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,360
Get me out of here!
We got to get out of here!

683
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,160
- Help!
- What are you doing?!

684
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,280
I'm swimming back to New York.

685
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,240
I know my chances are slim,
but I have to try!

686
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,720
- You can't swim!
- I said my chances are slim!

687
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,440
Nature! It's all over me!
Get it off! I can't see! I can't see!

688
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,880
I can see!

689
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,000
Look. There's obviously
just been a little mistake.

690
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,520
The people didn't
dump us here on purpose.

691
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:34,640
As soon as they realize what happened,
they'll come looking for us, right?

692
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,800
Yeah, right.

693
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:39,720
I don't know the words
But we're born free

694
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,200
You know something?
I bet they're already on their way.

695
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,640
Well, boys, it's going
to be ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

696
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,920
Rico.

697
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,440
Well, since I'm doomed
to die on this forsaken island,

698
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,720
I, Melman Mankiewicz,

699
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,040
being of sound mind
and unsound body,

700
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:14,120
have divided my estate
equally among the three of you.

701
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,520
Sorry, Alex.

702
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:21,080
Hey! A latrine. Nice work, Melman.
Outdoor plumbing.

703
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,960
No, it's not a latrine.

704
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,120
It's a grave. You sent Melman
to his grave. Are you happy?

705
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,480
Aw, come on.

706
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,840
This isn't the end.
This is a whole new beginning.

707
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:34,080
This could be the best that's happened.

708
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,080
No. No. No. No.

709
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:40,440
No. No. No. No. No. No. This is not
the best thing that's happened to us.

710
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,280
You abused the power of the birthday
wish and brought bad luck on all of us.

711
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,840
Why'd you tell your wish?
You're not supposed to.

712
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,400
I didn't want to tell you. Remember?

713
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,840
- You guys made me tell you.
- Oh, okay.

714
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,440
Besides, this isn't bad luck.
This is good luck.

715
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,200
Look around. There's no fences,
no schedules.

716
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,640
This place is beautiful.
Baby, we were born...

717
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,120
Okay. Okay. I've had enough of this.

718
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,960
This is your side of the island,
and this is our side of the island.

719
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,600
That is the bad side,
where you can prance and skip

720
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:15,000
like a magical pixie horse
and do whatever the heck you want.

721
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,880
This is the good side for those who
love New York and care about going home.

722
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,600
- Come on.
- No, no. Back! Back!

723
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,360
You know what? This isn't good.

724
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,600
Okay! You all have your side,
and I'll have mine.

725
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,400
And if you need me,
I'll be over here,

726
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,240
on the fun side of the island,
having a good old time.

727
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,800
This is the fun side,

728
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,040
where we'll have a great time
surviving until we go home.

729
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,720
- A yabbadabbado old time!
- This side's the best.

730
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,160
That side stinks! You're on
the Jersey side of this cesspool!

731
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,360
- Wilma!
- Now what do we do?

732
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,760
Don't worry. I have
a plan to get us rescued.

733
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,760
Can't wait to see the look
on Marty's face when he sees this.

734
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:02,360
Just look at him.
He's helpless without us.

735
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,080
Shut up, Spalding.

736
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,920
I've been standing
here for hours, man.

737
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,520
How long do I have
to pose like this?

738
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,600
She is finito.

739
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,120
I defy any rescue boat
within a million miles

740
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,160
to miss this baby.

741
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:37,280
When the moment is right,
we will ignite the beacon of liberty

742
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,920
and be rescued
from this awful nightmare!

743
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,840
What do you think?
Pretty cool, huh?

744
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,840
- How's the liberty fire going, Melman?
- Great. Idiot.

745
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,320
I heard that.

746
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,880
Why can't we just borrow
some of Marty's fire?

747
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,960
That's wild fire. We're not
using wild fire on Lady Liberty.

748
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,800
- Now, rub, Melman.
- I've been doing...

749
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,280
I can't. I can't.
I can't do it. I ju... I can't do it!

750
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,640
Fire.

751
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,760
Fire.

752
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,320
Fire! Fire!

753
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,280
Oh, my

754
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,880
Fire!

755
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:19,720
Not yet! No, no! No!

756
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,240
Fire!

757
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,680
Melman, hold still!

758
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,280
Jump! Alex, jump!

759
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,520
Don't worry,
cats always land on their...

760
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,240
Face? Man,
what kind of cat are you?

761
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,400
You maniac!

762
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,840
You burned it up!

763
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,080
Darn you!

764
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,920
Darn you all to heck!

765
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,360
Can we go to the fun side now?

766
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,600
Everybody, calm down.
Come on. Into your chairs.

767
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,360
Everybody, calm down.
Let go of his tail.

768
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,800
Separate those two,
would you, please?

769
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,560
You here, you there. Everyone...

770
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,960
Calm down, people, okay?

771
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:10,120
Now, presenting your royal highness,
the illustrious blah, blah, blah.

772
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,240
You know, et cetera, et cetera.
Hooray. Let's go.

773
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,840
Now, everybody,

774
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,400
we all have great curiosity
about our guests, the New York giants.

775
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,280
- Yes, Willie?
- I like them.

776
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,160
I like them. I liked them first.
Before I even met them I liked them.

777
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:28,840
I liked them right away. You hate
them compared to how much I like them.

778
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,080
Oh, shut up. You're so annoying!

779
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,280
Now, for as long
as we can remember,

780
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:39,960
we have been attacked
and eaten by the dreaded fossa.

781
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,600
The fossa! The fossa are attacking!

782
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,320
It's a cookbook! It's a cookbook!

783
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:49,960
Please. Maurice.

784
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,680
Quiet!

785
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,760
Come on, y'all. They're not
attacking us this very instant.

786
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,440
So my genius plan is this:

787
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,840
We will make the New York giants

788
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,680
our friends and keep them close.

789
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,920
Then, with Mr. Alex protecting us,

790
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,200
we will be safe
and never have to worry

791
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,920
about the dreaded fossa ever again.

792
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:23,000
I thought of that.
I thought of that. Yes. Me. I did.

793
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,680
Hold on, everybody. Hold on.
I'm just thinking now.

794
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,480
I mean, does anyone
wonder why the fossa

795
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:31,000
were so scared of Mr. Alex?

796
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:34,240
I mean,
maybe we should be scared too.

797
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:37,240
What if Mr. Alex
is even worse than the fossa?

798
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:41,760
I tell you, that dude just
gives me the heebiedabajeebies.

799
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:44,200
Maurice, you did not raise your hand.

800
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,840
Therefore, your heinous comment
will be stricken from the record.

801
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,160
Does anyone else
have the heebie-jeebies?

802
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,560
No? Good. So shut up.

803
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:57,760
When the New York giants wake up,

804
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:03,240
we will make sure
that they wake up in paradise.

805
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,760
Now, who would like a cookie?

806
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,040
Yo, Al. Melman and Gloria
are over there having a good time.

807
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,560
There's room
on the fun side for one more.

808
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,200
No, thanks.

809
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,280
Look, I've been thinking.
Maybe if you gave this place a chance,

810
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,200
I don't know, you might
even enjoy yourself.

811
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,600
Marty, I'm tired. I'm hungry.

812
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,520
I just want to go home.

813
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:56,440
Could you just give it a chance?
Think about it.

814
00:49:57,320 --> 00:50:00,120
It really isn't
the fun side without you.

815
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,840
I know. And then...

816
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:21,720
- It's him.
- Who is it?

817
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:25,360
It's the pizza man.
Who the heck do you think it is?

818
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,960
Yes? Can I help you?

819
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,080
Can I come to the fun side?

820
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:33,680
Beg your pardon?

821
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,560
You know, I've been kind of a jerk.

822
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,960
But I've been thinking
about what you said, and I'm sorry.

823
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,440
Welcome to Casa del Wild.
Take a load off.

824
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,400
Hey, hey, wipe your feet.

825
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:04,200
- Alex!
- Mi casa is su casa.

826
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,280
Very impressive.

827
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,280
Hey, have a drink. It's on the house.

828
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,200
This is seawater.

829
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,880
Oh, you don't swallow it. It's just
temporary till the plumbing's done.

830
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,800
Hey, y'all look hungry.

831
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,440
How would you like
some of nature's goodness?

832
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,080
You have food?

833
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,960
The Fun Side Special, coming up.

834
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,600
Seaweed on a stick.

835
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,080
Seaweed?

836
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:41,440
On a stick.
Don't love it till you try it.

837
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,480
That's unbelievable.

838
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,880
- So good.
- Well, thanks.

839
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,680
It does kind of hit the spot,
doesn't it?

840
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,760
Well, maybe it could
use a little lemon.

841
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:08,680
No, it's great. It's really great.
Doesn't get any better than this.

842
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,440
Oh, but it does.

843
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,560
Check this out.

844
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,440
Wow. Would you look at that.

845
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:25,840
It's like billions
and billions of helicopters.

846
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,200
It's a shooting star.
Make a wish. Quick!

847
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,320
Ooh! How about a thick, juicy steak?

848
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,840
You know what, Alex?

849
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:37,400
I promise you I'm going to find you
a steak tomorrow if it kills me.

850
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:38,720
Thanks, Marty.

851
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,720
It is getting late.
I guess I'm going to...

852
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,120
I think I'm going to
hit the sack too.

853
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,960
Sweet dreams, everyone.

854
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,360
Alex.

855
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,600
What are you doing?

856
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,720
Twenty-seven, 28, 29.
Thirty black and only 29 white.

857
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,520
Looks like you're black
with white stripes after all.

858
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,040
Dilemma solved. Good night.

859
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,720
You see, Maurice,
Mr. Alex was grooming his friend.

860
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,080
He is clearly a tender, loving thing.

861
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,960
How can you have the
heebie-jeebies for Mr. Alex?

862
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,520
Look at him.
He's so cute and plushy.

863
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,040
I don't think he was grooming him.

864
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,480
Look more like
he was tasting him to me.

865
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,720
Suit yourself, no matter.
I don't care.

866
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,800
Soon we will put my
excellent plan to action.

867
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,480
All we have to do is wait

868
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:19,040
until they are deep in their sleep.

869
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,320
How long is this going to take?!

870
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:54,040
Well, this sucks!

871
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,800
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

872
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,320
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

873
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,640
Rise and shining.

874
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,760
Wakey-waking, Mr. Alex!

875
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:08,240
Wake up! Alex!

876
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:09,920
You suck your thumb?

877
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,360
Where are we?
What the heck is going on?

878
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,600
Where's the beach?
Take it easy.

879
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:20,520
- Who built a forest?
- Don't be alarmed, giant freaks.

880
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:21,760
While you were asleep,

881
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,800
we simply took you
to our little corner of heaven.

882
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,040
Welcome to Madagascar.

883
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:30,560
- Mada-who-ah?
- What?

884
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,920
No, not whooha. Ascar.

885
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,880
Marty. It's...

886
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,400
Just like my mural back at the zoo.

887
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,480
Oh, no, fella, that is
the real deal right there.

888
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,520
Look at that, that's not a bad view.

889
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,320
That's the thing that you were always
looking at, but it's actually there.

890
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,720
- That's the real version of...
- How about once around the park?

891
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:01,080
Let's get our blood pumping,
lungs breathing this fresh air.

892
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,480
Who's with me?!

893
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,920
Naw. I don't think I could...
You're it!

894
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,520
Hey! Want to play around?

895
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:09,800
Got you there!

896
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:11,200
Come here!

897
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:12,680
You're it.

898
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:15,360
Hey, stop that!
Hey, you're crazy!

899
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,400
Okay, Marty, I'm it.

900
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,880
I'm it. I'm it. You win.

901
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,360
Come on, Alex, get in the groove.

902
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,240
I haven't eaten in two days.

903
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,320
My blood sugar's real low.
I just don't have the energy.

904
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:30,160
I don't think that's your problem.

905
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,800
First of all, that's not
how you run in the wild.

906
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,760
Let's go. Put the rubber to the road!

907
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,760
You just have
to let out that inner lion.

908
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,120
- Now, who's the cat?
- Marty, I really don't...

909
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,200
You are, that's who.
Come on! Here we go!

910
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,960
That's it. Let's build up
some steam! You the cat.

911
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,560
- Who's the cat?
- You the cat.

912
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,160
- Who's the cat?
- You the cat.

913
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:52,680
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

914
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:56,720
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

915
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,720
I'm the cat!

916
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,720
Surprise!

917
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,360
You're it. You're it!

918
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,640
Can't juke the cat. Cat's too quick.

919
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:25,640
I feel like a mile-high pastrami on rye
on the fly from the deli in the sky!

920
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,480
- Let's go wild!
- Now you're talking!

921
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,920
Man! I feel different.

922
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,160
Noogie, noogie, noogie.
Noogie, noogie, noogie!

923
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,640
Kind of charged up or something.

924
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:48,400
- Like you said, baby, it's...
- Crackalacking.

925
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,720
- Ain't that right, Melman?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

926
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,800
I'm in heaven.

927
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,640
You see, Maurice, Alex is now our friend
and the fossas are nowhere to be seen.

928
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,480
It could be said
that my plan is working

929
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:07,720
in a very good working kind of way.

930
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,760
Alex. You got to try some of this.

931
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,720
I feel good.
Feel like a king again.

932
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,640
King?

933
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,120
You should see his act.

934
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:22,240
Come on, Alex, why don't you
show him some of your act.

935
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:25,120
Oh. No, I really
don't think I could... Okay.

936
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,320
Ladies and gentlemen.
Primates of all ages.

937
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:30,400
The wild proudly presents:

938
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:31,880
The king.

939
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,640
Alex the lion!

940
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,800
E flat, fellas.

941
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,480
Yeah! The king is in the house!

942
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:52,280
See, if he is the king, then where
is his crown? I've got a crown.

943
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,360
Got a very nice one.
And it's here on my head.

944
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,320
Look at it. Have I got it on?

945
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,280
Do the roar, man. Do the roar.

946
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,400
Wow. I've never heard
that one before.

947
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,600
Yeah! Go wild, man! Come on!

948
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,240
Break out the wave!

949
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,120
Excuse me.

950
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,360
You're biting my butt.

951
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,920
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

952
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,760
- What did you do?
- You just bit me!

953
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:58,880
No. I didn't. Did I?

954
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,480
You kind of did.

955
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,560
What the heck is wrong with you?

956
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:05,440
Why'd you bite me?

957
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,200
- Man, it's because you are his dinner.
- What?!

958
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,440
- Excuse me?
- That's dumb.

959
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,800
Come, come, Maurice. What is a simple
bite on the buttocks among friends?

960
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:16,680
Here, give me a nibble.

961
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:20,280
The party is over, Julien.
Your brilliant plan has failed.

962
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:22,040
What are you talking about?

963
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:23,720
Your friend here is what we call

964
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,840
a deluxe-model hunting
and eating machine.

965
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,760
And he eats steak...

966
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,240
...which is you.

967
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:34,320
- Get out of here.
- Okey-dokey, Maurice, I admit it.

968
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,160
The plan failed.

969
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,360
All is lost! We're all doomed.

970
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:44,040
The fossas will come back and
gobble us with their mouths because...

971
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:46,360
...we are all steak.

972
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,200
I'm steak! Me, me, me!

973
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,440
Mr. Alex cannot stay here.

974
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,640
He belongs with his own kind
on the fossa side of the island.

975
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,520
By the power vested in me,

976
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,760
by the law of the jungle,
blah, blah, blah, blah...

977
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,960
Be gone!

978
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,720
What? Come on, do I look
like a steak to you?

979
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:04,960
Yeah!

980
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,840
See, I told you I don't
look like a... Wait. What you say?

981
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,200
Oh, yeah!

982
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,080
- He's going savage.
- Run for your lives.

983
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,600
Marty, run!

984
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,280
A bull's eye.
Excellent shot, Maurice.

985
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,400
Thank you.

986
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:45,800
Marty?

987
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:49,960
I'm so sorry, Marty.

988
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,920
What is wrong with me?

989
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,240
Ow.

990
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,000
Oh, no.

991
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,680
What have I done?

992
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,720
It's true. I'm a monster.

993
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,680
I got to get out of here.

994
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:17,120
What have I done?
This is a nightmare.

995
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:18,840
And it's all my fault.

996
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,760
Now, because of me,
we've lost Alex.

997
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,400
Well, what are we going to do?

998
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,040
We'll find a way to help him.
That's what we'll do.

999
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,040
Okay.

1000
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,760
Come on, we are New Yorkers, right?

1001
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:32,000
We're tough.
We're gritty.

1002
01:04:32,040 --> 01:04:33,720
We're adaptable!

1003
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:36,600
And we are not going
to lay down like a bunch of Melmans.

1004
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:39,040
No, we're not.

1005
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,320
Oh. Gloria.

1006
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:43,360
That was not me, okay?
That was the boat.

1007
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,560
- The boat!
- The boat?

1008
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:49,440
The boat's come back for us!
Come on, guys, we got to flag it down.

1009
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,480
There it is!

1010
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:54,400
- Hey, over here!
- Over here!

1011
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:55,880
Over here! Yo!

1012
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,520
Melman, give me a lift.
Hurry up! Lift me up!

1013
01:04:58,600 --> 01:04:59,920
Help! Help! Help!

1014
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,720
- Oh, my neck. My neck. You guys.
- Over here!

1015
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:06,360
- Melman! Steady. This way!
- You have no idea how much this hurts.

1016
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,200
Hey, boat! We're over here!

1017
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:14,280
Look! It's turning! It's coming back!
It's coming back!

1018
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,560
Come on! Come on, baby!

1019
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,280
Yes! You guys.

1020
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,560
You flag down that boat.
I'll get Alex.

1021
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:24,360
Whoa! Hold on there.

1022
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,720
You cannot go back there by yourself.

1023
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,000
Aw, come on. I know Alex.

1024
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:31,720
He hears we're rescued,
he'll snap right out of it.

1025
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,120
The people are coming.
They can help us.

1026
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,080
Melman's right. The people
will know what to do.

1027
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,280
Now, we got to flag down that boat.

1028
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,480
Now, this is more like it.

1029
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,760
You?! Oh, ma...
Where are the people?

1030
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,680
We killed them and ate their livers.

1031
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,920
Got you, didn't I?

1032
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,520
Just kidding, doll,
the people are fine.

1033
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,800
They're on a slow lifeboat to China.

1034
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,120
Hey, I know you two.

1035
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:20,440
Where's that psychotic lion
and our monochromatic friend?

1036
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:24,320
Marty? He's righ... Where did
he go? He was right behind us.

1037
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,800
He went back for Alex.
He's going to get himself killed!

1038
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,920
Well, boys, our
monochromatic friend's in danger.

1039
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,800
Looks like we have a job to do.

1040
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:35,600
Captain's log: Embarking
into hostile environment.

1041
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:39,040
Kowalski. We'll need to win the
hearts and the minds of the natives.

1042
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:41,600
Rico. We'll need
special tactical equipment.

1043
01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:44,160
We're going to face extreme peril.

1044
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,520
Private probably won't survive.

1045
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,800
Alex! Come out, Alex!

1046
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,080
The boat's here! We can go home!

1047
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:09,200
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

1048
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:13,800
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

1049
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,160
Alex! Alex! Alex!

1050
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,800
Alex! Alex! Alex!

1051
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,200
Alex!

1052
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:25,080
Alex!

1053
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:28,320
Marty?

1054
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,000
Snap out of it, Alex. The boat
came back. We can get out of here.

1055
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:35,960
We can go back to civilization, and
everything will be like it used to be.

1056
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,440
Stay back.

1057
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:39,480
Please.

1058
01:07:40,560 --> 01:07:42,440
I'm a monster.

1059
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:45,720
Alex, you're no monster.
You're my friend.

1060
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:48,760
We're a team.
You and me, remember?

1061
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,360
I don't want to hurt you.

1062
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:30,240
Alex.

1063
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:32,280
I ain't leaving without you.

1064
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:50,600
Alex? I'm thinking of a song.

1065
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,480
It's a wonderful song.
I'm sure you're familiar with it.

1066
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:59,440
Start spreadin' the news

1067
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,160
I'm leaving today

1068
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:08,680
We are a great big part of it

1069
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:15,080
Come on, you know the words.
Two little words.

1070
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,720
Please don't make me
sing this by myself.

1071
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,840
You really don't want
to hear me sing this by myself.

1072
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:27,880
Uh, Alex? Could you
come out here for a minute?

1073
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:31,240
Hey, Alex, a little help.

1074
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:33,400
Help me!

1075
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,520
Alex! Help!

1076
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:44,400
Help me! Anybody, help me! Somebody!

1077
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,400
Help!

1078
01:09:58,160 --> 01:09:59,720
- Melman?
- That's right, baby.

1079
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,480
Run!

1080
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,600
- What's the plan?
- This is the plan.

1081
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,200
- Fossa hungry.
- Fossa eat.

1082
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,440
This is the plan?

1083
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,720
Fossa halt.

1084
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,600
Fossa ooh.

1085
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,160
Fossa aaahh.

1086
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,680
Fossa ooh.

1087
01:10:24,160 --> 01:10:26,440
Fossa aaahh.

1088
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,960
Come and get it.

1089
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,000
Fossa.

1090
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,040
- Take that.
- Fossa ow!

1091
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,440
There's too many of them, skipper.

1092
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:49,480
It's been a real pleasure
serving with you boys.

1093
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,240
Alex?

1094
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,680
That's my kill.

1095
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,040
Mine.

1096
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:07,160
Alex hungry.

1097
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:09,920
Alex eat.

1098
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,400
It's showtime.

1099
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,080
Thanks for not giving up on me.

1100
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:35,800
Man, you almost gave me a heart attack.
You can't just come sneak up on me.

1101
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,760
Just because you're a lion...
Let go of me. Let go of me.

1102
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,120
We're getting out of here.
Guys, just go with me on this.

1103
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:44,160
Like I said, it's showtime.

1104
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:46,720
Mine.

1105
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,320
My kill.

1106
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,480
They're all mine.

1107
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,440
It's the king of the beasts! Oh, no!

1108
01:11:56,520 --> 01:11:58,440
- Don't eat me!
- He's big and scary!

1109
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,760
Fear me! Savagery
beyond comprehension.

1110
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,640
- I am far too young to die!
- You're a monster! A monster, I say!

1111
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,080
- And, you!
- Me?

1112
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,600
Oh, you want some of this? Ooh!
You better run for your lives.

1113
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
- Somebody call a cop!
- He's psychotic!

1114
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:29,400
This is my territory.
Understand?

1115
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:34,400
I never, ever want
to see you on my turf again.

1116
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:41,760
Boo.

1117
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,360
Yeah! You the cat!

1118
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:49,160
Got my boy back!

1119
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:51,960
I did it!

1120
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:55,880
Give me some love! The plan worked!
The plan worked! I'm very clever!

1121
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:59,160
I'm the one, baby! Come on.
Time to robot.

1122
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,320
I am very clever king.

1123
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,560
I am super genius.

1124
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:06,120
I am robot king of the monkey things.

1125
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,600
- Compute, compute.
- So, what's for lunch?

1126
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,720
- Close those eyes.
- Why do I have to?

1127
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,200
- Do it.
- They're closed.

1128
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,040
- Tighter.
- Yes, sir.

1129
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:18,760
- No peeking.
- They're closed.

1130
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:20,520
Rico.

1131
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:25,280
Hai.

1132
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,040
Open that hatch.

1133
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:31,360
Fire in the hole. Now chew.

1134
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:34,600
Chew like you mean it.
Savor it.

1135
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,120
- And?
- Well?

1136
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,960
Pretty good, right?

1137
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,360
There's always Plan B.

1138
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,800
This is better than steak.

1139
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:46,560
I love it. I love it!

1140
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,520
The kitty loves the fishy.

1141
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,480
Well, I propose a toast.

1142
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,360
Now, he may be a pain
in the butt at times...

1143
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:58,440
And trust me, I know.

1144
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,120
But this cat proved
to me without a doubt

1145
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,520
that his heart
is bigger than his stomach.

1146
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:05,320
- To Alex.
- To Alex.

1147
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,800
Enough! Stop it!

1148
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,560
What do you think?
Should we head back to New York?

1149
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,000
I don't know. I mean,
this is your dream.

1150
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:23,000
You sure you want to leave?

1151
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:24,960
I don't care where we are.

1152
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:28,200
As long as we're together,
it doesn't matter to me.

1153
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:29,800
Well, in that case...

1154
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,920
Yo. Rico.
I'll take 300 orders to go.

1155
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,280
Hai.

1156
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,920
But before you leave,
I have an announcement to make.

1157
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,840
So shut up, everyone, please.
Thank you.

1158
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:45,280
After much deep and profound
brain things inside my head,

1159
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,600
I have decided to thank you

1160
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:50,280
for bringing peace to our home.

1161
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,920
And to make you feel good,

1162
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,720
I'm going to give you
this lovely parting gift.

1163
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:57,520
No, I couldn't. Really,
I can't take your crown.

1164
01:14:57,560 --> 01:14:59,960
That's okay,
I've got a bigger crown.

1165
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:01,280
It's got a gecko on it.

1166
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:04,400
Look at him shake.
Go, Stevie, go!

1167
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:05,480
- Bye, little fuzzbuckets!
- Thanks for everything!

1168
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:08,120
- Bye, little fuzzbuckets!
- Thanks for everything!

1169
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:09,640
- So long!
- Bye-bye, now.

1170
01:15:09,680 --> 01:15:11,240
- Arrivederci.
- Bye-bye.

1171
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,840
- Toodle-oo!
- See you later, crocodile.

1172
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,880
Maurice, my arm is tired.
Wave it for me.

1173
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,880
Faster, you naughty little monkey.

1174
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,160
By the time we get back to New York,
it'll be the middle of winter.

1175
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,160
So I was just thinking, why rush?

1176
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:28,080
Maybe we could make
a few side stops along the way.

1177
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,440
- Maybe Paris.
- You just read my mind.

1178
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,840
- I was thinking Spain.
- Run with the bulls.

1179
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,560
- What about Fiji?
- Canada. Can we?

1180
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,400
Cheap meds.

1181
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,007
I wouldn't even mind coming 
back here sometime.

1182
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:42,360
- I could do that.
- You could say that again.

1183
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:45,280
- Skipper?
- I always wanted to go to Australia.

1184
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,800
Don't you think we should tell
them that the boat's out of gas?

1185
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:49,960
Nah.

1186
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,760
Just smile and wave, boys.
Smile and wave.

1187
