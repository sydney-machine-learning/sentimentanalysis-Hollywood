1
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,927
In 1935, Ed Murrow
began his career with CBS.

2
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:41,391
When World War Two broke out...

3
00:02:41,483 --> 00:02:44,270
...his voice brought
the battle of Britain home to us...

4
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:46,816
...through his "This Is London"
radio series.

5
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:49,281
He started with us all...

6
00:02:49,407 --> 00:02:52,823
...many of us here tonight,
when television was in its infancy...

7
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:55,366
...with the news documentary show,
"See It Now'.

8
00:02:55,538 --> 00:02:57,282
He threw stones at giants.

9
00:02:58,374 --> 00:03:01,624
Segregation, exploitation
of migrant workers...

10
00:03:01,836 --> 00:03:03,912
...apartheid, J. Edgar Hoover...

11
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:08,925
...not the least of which, his historical
fight with Senator McCarthy.

12
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:13,671
He is the host of our enormously
popular show "Person to Person"...

13
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,177
...and tonight he is here
with his son, Casey...

14
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:20,977
...wife, Janet, and all of you
who he's worked with...

15
00:03:21,313 --> 00:03:24,398
...inspired, lectured, and taught.

16
00:03:25,526 --> 00:03:26,854
Ladies and gentlemen...

17
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:31,107
...the Radio-Television News Directors'
Association and Foundation welcomes...

18
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:33,440
...Mr. Edward R. Murrow.

19
00:03:54,095 --> 00:03:56,254
This might just do nobody any good.

20
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,888
At the end of this discourse
a few people may accuse this reporter...

21
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:03,183
...of fouling
his own comfortable nest...

22
00:04:03,605 --> 00:04:07,139
...and your organization may be
accused of having given hospitality...

23
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:09,605
...to heretical
and even dangerous ideas.

24
00:04:10,653 --> 00:04:12,942
But the elaborate structure
of networks...

25
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:16,862
...advertising agencies, and sponsors
will not be shaken or altered.

26
00:04:17,743 --> 00:04:21,159
It is my desire, if not my duty,
to try to talk to you journeymen...

27
00:04:21,247 --> 00:04:24,782
...with some candor about what
is happening to radio andtelevision.

28
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:26,833
And if what I say is responsible...

29
00:04:27,253 --> 00:04:29,826
...I alone am responsible
for the saying ofit.

30
00:04:31,048 --> 00:04:33,206
Our history will be
what we make of it.

31
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:37,675
And if there are any historians
about 50 or 100 years from now...

32
00:04:37,763 --> 00:04:39,387
...and there should be preserved...

33
00:04:39,473 --> 00:04:42,308
...the kinescopes of one week
of all three networks...

34
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:46,391
...they will there find recorded
in black and white, and in color...

35
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,020
...evidence of decadence,
escapism...

36
00:04:49,107 --> 00:04:52,726
...and insulation from the realities
of the world in which we live.

37
00:04:53,278 --> 00:04:57,062
We are currently wealthy, fat,
comfortable, and complacent.

38
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:01,614
We have a built-in allergy to
unpleasant or disturbing information.

39
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:04,034
Our mass media reflect this.

40
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,412
But unless we get up off
our fat surpluses...

41
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,956
...and recognize
that television in the main...

42
00:05:10,044 --> 00:05:14,256
...is being used to distract, delude,
amuse, and insulate us...

43
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:17,046
...then television
and those who finance it...

44
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:20,052
...those who look at it
and those who work at it...

45
00:05:20,388 --> 00:05:22,961
...may see atotally
different picture too late.

46
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:13,139
Millie! Just the person
I wanted to see! Come here!

47
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:25,107
This goes at the top
of the Roy Campanella piece.

48
00:06:25,201 --> 00:06:26,316
Yes! Give me a half an hour.

49
00:06:26,411 --> 00:06:28,237
I may need it
a little quicker than that!

50
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:31,449
- Can I get some coffee first?
- Come on! Get me some coffee!

51
00:06:33,543 --> 00:06:34,705
Morning, Johnny!

52
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:37,914
I have some new notes that go
with the Tito footage for Fred.

53
00:06:38,005 --> 00:06:39,250
Fred's gonna be in
in an hour.

54
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,543
I already put them on his desk.
Can you just make sure that...

55
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,422
...he doesn't look at the film
until he reads the notes?

56
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:46,841
- Yes.
- Thank you.

57
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:48,212
Hey, Joe! Shirley!

58
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:52,139
- What's going on in here?
- What do you mean?

59
00:06:52,227 --> 00:06:54,137
Two attractive people
alone in the copy room!

60
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:55,510
Don't tell Paley, he'll fire me.

61
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:57,100
He'll fire both of us, Shirley.

62
00:06:57,191 --> 00:06:59,978
- Rules are made to be broken!
- You can afford to say that.

63
00:07:04,615 --> 00:07:05,860
Let me see this.

64
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:13,112
- It's simply a loyalty oath.
- To CBS? - And to America.

65
00:07:13,373 --> 00:07:14,867
You promise to be a loyal American?

66
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,116
I know. All of the reporters
have signed this.

67
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,918
Who are you promising this to?
CBS?

68
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:20,996
Fred signed it.
Murrow signed it.

69
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:22,464
- Murrow signed it?
- Yeah.

70
00:07:23,925 --> 00:07:25,668
Are you now
or have you ever been...

71
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,002
I thought it was a joke,
but there's a lot of pressure.

72
00:07:28,096 --> 00:07:30,634
...on the Attorney General's list
of subversive groups?

73
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:32,930
- I don't know.
- Let's think about it.

74
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:36,600
What is it really saying? Is it a civil
liberties issue or censorship?

75
00:07:36,687 --> 00:07:39,013
Am I simply stating to CBS
that I'm not a Communist?

76
00:07:39,107 --> 00:07:41,432
- Murrow signed this?
- And Fred and Stanton.

77
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:44,692
- Maybe you should talk toMurrow.
- Maybe I should sign it.

78
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:48,650
If you don't sign this,
are you and I a target?

79
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:52,909
If I don'tsign it,
they'll fire me.

80
00:07:59,376 --> 00:08:00,372
Sign it.

81
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:02,953
Finally we can tell everyone
the truth.

82
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:07,672
If I could express it
in what's in my heart now...

83
00:08:08,051 --> 00:08:12,429
...I'd do it in the terms
of the poet who once said...

84
00:08:13,015 --> 00:08:16,383
..."Ah, 'tis but a dainty flower
I bring to you."

85
00:08:17,394 --> 00:08:19,433
'Yes, 'tis but a violet..."

86
00:08:20,397 --> 00:08:21,891
"...glistening with dew."

87
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:26,434
"But still in its heart
there lie beauties concealed."

88
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:29,189
"So in our heart..."

89
00:08:30,615 --> 00:08:32,193
"...our love for you..."

90
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:35,774
"...lies unrevealed."

91
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:39,404
I used to...

92
00:08:45,588 --> 00:08:50,582
...pride myself on the idea
that I was a bit... tough...

93
00:08:52,386 --> 00:08:58,590
...especially over the past
19-19 months, when we've been...

94
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:02,263
...kicked around,
and bullwhipped, and damned.

95
00:09:03,564 --> 00:09:04,892
I didnt think that...

96
00:09:07,192 --> 00:09:10,193
...I could be... touched very deeply.

97
00:09:10,404 --> 00:09:12,646
Okay, that's enough.
That's enough, Leo.

98
00:09:12,739 --> 00:09:14,779
- It's short.
- Howlong is the piece?

99
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:16,610
It's 4 minutes,
but we can cut it down.

100
00:09:16,702 --> 00:09:19,489
It cant stand alone, but it might be
a nice companion piece.

101
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,905
Let's go through this one more time.
Palmer!

102
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:25,332
Yep, got a call from the office
of Senator Morse this morning...

103
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:28,538
...interested in setting up
a debate possibly with Senator Kerr...

104
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,086
...over the comments
Bentsen made on last night's show.

105
00:09:31,174 --> 00:09:34,424
Secretary of Agriculture? Good idea!
Can they do it by this week?

106
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:37,084
No, it would have to be 2 weeks
at the earliest...

107
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,513
...depending on Morse's schedule.
But still it's a great idea.

108
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,933
Let's follow up on that.
"Hoover speaks on Benjamin Franklin."

109
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,140
We're having better luck
with Mr. Benjamin Frankin...

110
00:09:47,231 --> 00:09:48,476
...than with Mr. Hoover.

111
00:09:48,566 --> 00:09:51,022
It may progress better
as a "Person to Person".

112
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,566
"At home with Ben Frankin.
His electricity awards."

113
00:09:53,654 --> 00:09:55,564
We've got the footage,
we need to contact him.

114
00:09:55,656 --> 00:09:59,357
See if you can contact him and get the
shot. He wants to do the story. Joe!

115
00:09:59,452 --> 00:10:01,195
Member Delbert Clark?
No longer with us.

116
00:10:01,287 --> 00:10:03,825
- New York Times? - Yeah.
- Our friend at the Times.

117
00:10:03,914 --> 00:10:06,619
This was yesterday morning,
they're saying it's...

118
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:10,417
- How old was he?
- 53. Sudden illness.

119
00:10:10,504 --> 00:10:13,173
- Home of a friend.
- No, it's not a nobit piece.

120
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,878
Natalie send some flowers
over there from us.

121
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:18,668
Couple things.
Case before the Supreme Court...

122
00:10:18,762 --> 00:10:22,676
...involving the constitutionality of a
section of the Internal Security Act...

123
00:10:22,766 --> 00:10:24,723
...provides for the deportation
of any alien...

124
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:27,561
...if he becomes a Communist
after entering this country.

125
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:29,184
Can you take this?

126
00:10:29,272 --> 00:10:31,846
All right. McCarthy interrupting
his wedding trip...

127
00:10:31,942 --> 00:10:35,441
...to take charge of the investigation
of Communist infiltration...

128
00:10:35,529 --> 00:10:37,936
- Natalie, send some flowers.
- Poor Mrs. McCarthy!

129
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:40,154
May I finish?
It's national security!

130
00:10:40,241 --> 00:10:43,029
- A real ladies' man!
- Well, they're in love.

131
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:47,914
We have no show for Tuesday, fellows.
So get out there and make some news.

132
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,083
Rob a bank. Mug an old lady.
Do something.

133
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:55,500
- You look at the Secretary Stevens
footage? - We will.

134
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,128
Watch it all the way to the end,
it's worth it.

135
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:00,917
Thank you, John.

136
00:11:01,846 --> 00:11:03,221
There's notmuch there.

137
00:11:03,347 --> 00:11:06,847
I can't tie it to the Eisenhower
in the back of the train piece.

138
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:10,512
- You ever spend any time in Detroit,
Fred? - Not recently.

139
00:11:11,897 --> 00:11:15,147
There's a story here
in the Detroit News, Dexter, Michigan.

140
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:17,977
A kid named Milo Radulovich.

141
00:11:19,572 --> 00:11:23,320
- Italian? - Irish. Air Force
kicked him out because his dad...

142
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:28,035
...reads ome Serbian newspaper.
- Was he a Communist? - I don't know.

143
00:11:28,122 --> 00:11:29,948
- Who brought the charges?
- Air Force.

144
00:11:30,749 --> 00:11:33,370
Charges were in a sealed envelope,
nobody saw them.

145
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,746
- Not even at the hearing? - He was
declared guilty without a trial...

146
00:11:36,838 --> 00:11:38,582
...and told if he wanted
to keep his job...

147
00:11:38,673 --> 00:11:41,959
...he had to denounce his father
and his sister. Thank you, Natalie.

148
00:11:42,052 --> 00:11:44,507
- His sister?
- He told them to take a hike.

149
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:49,888
Let's send Joe and Charlie down there,
see if he's any good on camera.

150
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,265
Is he being brought
before the Committee?

151
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:53,975
No.

152
00:11:55,106 --> 00:11:56,481
Then it's not McCarthy.

153
00:11:58,109 --> 00:11:59,105
Isn't it?

154
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:06,741
Milo Radulovich.

155
00:12:10,997 --> 00:12:12,407
What happens to your children...

156
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,416
...your 5-year-old and your 5-month-old
in terms of you?

157
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,455
If I am being judged
on my relatives...

158
00:12:19,463 --> 00:12:24,540
...are my children going
to be asked to denounce me?

159
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:28,680
Are they going to be judged
on what their father was labeled?

160
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:34,384
Are they going to have to explain
to their friends, etc...

161
00:12:34,478 --> 00:12:36,803
...why their father
is a security risk?

162
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:42,435
If the thing is let stand
as it, the first recommendation...

163
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:46,947
...was sent out by the board,
I see a chain reaction that...

164
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:50,030
...has no end to anybody,
for anybody.

165
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,036
Well, that's new.

166
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:00,877
You can't call this
a neutral piece.

167
00:13:00,962 --> 00:13:04,248
The other side's been represented
rather well for the last 2 years.

168
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,918
The Air Force
hasn't gone on the record.

169
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:09,045
So you want to forego the standards
you've stuck to for 15 years...

170
00:13:09,137 --> 00:13:10,382
...both sides, no commentary.

171
00:13:10,471 --> 00:13:13,472
- We all editorialize. - I'm just
making sure we identify what...

172
00:13:13,558 --> 00:13:15,218
We're giving them
the information up front...

173
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:16,887
...and we're asking them
to comment on it.

174
00:13:16,978 --> 00:13:18,009
Frank, hold on.

175
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:20,431
I've searched my conscience.

176
00:13:20,606 --> 00:13:23,809
I can't for the life of me
find any justification for this.

177
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:26,772
I simply cannot accept
that there are, on every story...

178
00:13:26,862 --> 00:13:28,902
...two equal and logical sides
to an argument.

179
00:13:28,989 --> 00:13:31,943
- Call it editorializing, if you'd like.
- It is editorializing.

180
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:33,742
They'll have equal time
to defend themselves.

181
00:13:33,827 --> 00:13:35,903
Do you understand the position
you're putting us in?

182
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:38,950
We are all in this together,
if the Senate wants to investigate...

183
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:40,072
Do me a favor...

184
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:43,500
...avoid any big speeches about how
we're all in a big boat together!

185
00:13:43,587 --> 00:13:44,785
Please, don't insult me.

186
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:49,467
I have to go back to Mr. Paley
and Alcoa, who sponsors your show...

187
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:52,293
...and also have
some military contracts...

188
00:13:52,387 --> 00:13:55,590
...and I have to tell them that
they're going to be in a tough bind...

189
00:13:55,682 --> 00:13:57,722
...because of a beef you had
with Joe McCarthy.

190
00:13:57,809 --> 00:14:00,929
- We're not going at McCarthy.
- You're starting the goddamn fire.

191
00:14:01,021 --> 00:14:04,390
Excuse me. Mr. Friendly,
there's a Colonel Anderson to see you?

192
00:14:04,482 --> 00:14:07,982
- Colonel? - He's in your office.
There are two of them.

193
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:13,029
Maybe they liked the transcript,
and want to compliment us on it.

194
00:14:13,616 --> 00:14:14,647
Excuse me.

195
00:14:22,834 --> 00:14:25,585
Go after Joe Kennedy.
We'll pay for it.

196
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:28,163
I've got a great story about Hoover.

197
00:14:32,134 --> 00:14:34,590
You know how many shows
you're going to have to do...

198
00:14:34,678 --> 00:14:37,763
...to make up for this? - And Judy
and her daughter Liza next week.

199
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:39,924
No, no.
You're interviewing Rin Tin Tin!

200
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:46,564
I'll talk to Mr. Paley.

201
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:50,978
Alcoa wont pay for the ads.

202
00:14:51,987 --> 00:14:55,652
And we probably wont either.
But nobody'll stop you.

203
00:14:55,741 --> 00:14:56,903
How much are the ads?

204
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:02,327
- 3,000.
- I'll split it with Fred.

205
00:15:03,915 --> 00:15:07,249
He just won't have Christmas presents
for his kids this year.

206
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:10,789
- He's a Jew. - Don't tell him that,
he loves Christmas.

207
00:15:19,973 --> 00:15:22,973
- To be clear, you did speak
with the lawyers? - Yes, we did.

208
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:26,344
And we read the transcript. We've not
been allowed to see the footage.

209
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:29,474
Mack is on a plane from Dexter
right now with the last interviews.

210
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:31,309
We'll be going
right down to the wire.

211
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:36,062
Your show airs tomorrow. How can we
possibly approve and check...

212
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:39,856
...your story in the limited amount
of time you have given us?

213
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,651
With all due respect, you have been
invited to participate in this piece...

214
00:15:43,746 --> 00:15:45,121
...not to approve it.

215
00:15:45,748 --> 00:15:48,784
We are going with the story
that says that the U.S. Air Force...

216
00:15:48,876 --> 00:15:51,414
...tried Milo Radulovich
without any evidence...

217
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:54,077
...and found him guilty
of being a security risk...

218
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:57,838
...without his Constitutional rights...
- You have not seen the evidence...

219
00:15:57,926 --> 00:16:00,251
...and are claiming
he's not a security risk.

220
00:16:00,345 --> 00:16:04,473
Wouldn't you guess that those who have
seen the contents of that envelope...

221
00:16:04,558 --> 00:16:08,602
...might have a better idea of what
makes someone a danger to his country?

222
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:12,020
- Who? Who? - Or do you think
it should just be you that decides?

223
00:16:12,107 --> 00:16:14,680
Who are the people?
Are they elected? Are they appointed?

224
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:17,445
Do they have an axe to grind?
Is it you, sir?

225
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:21,942
Or you, Colonel Jenkns? Do you know
the contents of that sealed envelope?

226
00:16:22,951 --> 00:16:28,490
We have been a friend and ally of both
Mr. Murrow and CBS News for many years.

227
00:16:29,082 --> 00:16:32,367
The story you are going
to run tomorrow is without merit.

228
00:16:32,877 --> 00:16:35,997
So before you take any steps
that cannot be undone...

229
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,050
...I strongly urge you
to reconsider your stand.

230
00:16:39,717 --> 00:16:43,168
These are very dangerous waters
you are attempting to navigate.

231
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:55,140
We have had no hearing at all.
We have had noday in court.

232
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:59,694
In all the 32 years that I have been
a practicing attorney in Detroit...

233
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:04,446
...I have never witnessed such a farce
and travesty upon justice...

234
00:17:04,533 --> 00:17:06,526
...as this thing has developed.

235
00:17:06,827 --> 00:17:09,614
- Now this whole theory...
- Eddie, just take the first reel.

236
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:11,662
Tell John I left
5 seconds extra leader.

237
00:17:11,748 --> 00:17:15,117
5 seconds! I got it! Palmer,
where's Joe? Have you seen Joe?

238
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:16,490
He's on his way
to the control room.

239
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:18,246
We're gonna have to do
the voice-over live.

240
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,129
Natalie, I need a booth
with a live mic.

241
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:21,460
Booth is there, it's already set.

242
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,756
We didn't have time
to sync the voice-over out.

243
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,670
That's not what I asked for.

244
00:17:27,347 --> 00:17:29,304
It's missing the voice-over
on the last piece.

245
00:17:29,391 --> 00:17:31,513
There's a commercial in the booth.
What shall I do?

246
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:34,353
- 2 minutes to air! - There's not
supposed to be a commercial!

247
00:17:34,437 --> 00:17:35,718
Get himout of the booth!

248
00:17:39,275 --> 00:17:41,481
2-and-a-half minutes
on the end piece.

249
00:17:42,653 --> 00:17:45,358
Keep it down, please.
It's a little loud.

250
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:46,770
2 minutes to air, fellas.

251
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,534
- He's gonna add a joke.
- Charlie, loan me your lighter.

252
00:17:53,414 --> 00:17:56,747
Make sure you know that I swap
with those two pieces of parents.

253
00:17:56,834 --> 00:17:59,835
- As long as he talks fast because...
- He will talk fast.

254
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:06,129
We got the film.

255
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:08,589
Will it be ready?

256
00:18:09,096 --> 00:18:10,127
You bet.

257
00:18:16,103 --> 00:18:17,348
Funny thing, Freddy!

258
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:21,098
Every time you light a cigarette
for me, I know you're lying.

259
00:18:35,705 --> 00:18:38,623
It occurs t ome
we might not get away with this one.

260
00:18:45,006 --> 00:18:48,042
Alcoa, the aluminum company
of America...

261
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:50,292
- 10 seconds.
- You fellas, ready? Okay.

262
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:51,833
Ready on camera 1.

263
00:18:58,811 --> 00:19:03,105
5, 4,3, 2.

264
00:19:05,985 --> 00:19:07,230
Pan, camera 1.

265
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:09,775
Good evening.

266
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:13,904
A few weeks ago there occurred a few
obscure notices in the newspapers...

267
00:19:13,993 --> 00:19:15,784
...about Milo Radulovich...

268
00:19:16,161 --> 00:19:18,368
...a lieutenant
in the Air Force Reserves.

269
00:19:18,705 --> 00:19:22,370
And, also, something about Air Force
regulation 35-62...

270
00:19:23,252 --> 00:19:26,834
...which states that a man
may be regarded as a security risk...

271
00:19:26,922 --> 00:19:30,172
...if he has close and continuing
association with Communists...

272
00:19:30,258 --> 00:19:32,963
...or people believed
to have Communist sympathies.

273
00:19:33,887 --> 00:19:37,422
Lieutenant Radulovich was asked
to resign in August. He declined.

274
00:19:37,682 --> 00:19:39,889
A board was called
and heard his case.

275
00:19:39,976 --> 00:19:43,594
At the end it was recommended that
he be severed from the Air Force...

276
00:19:43,688 --> 00:19:47,104
...although it was also stated
that there was no question whatever...

277
00:19:47,192 --> 00:19:49,018
...as to the Lieutenant's loyalty.

278
00:19:49,152 --> 00:19:51,559
We propose to examine,
in so far as we can...

279
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:53,777
...the case of Lieutenant Radulovich.

280
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,777
Our reporter, Joe Wershba,
cameraman, Charlie Mack.

281
00:19:57,702 --> 00:20:00,703
This is the town of Dexter, Michigan.
Population 1500.

282
00:20:01,122 --> 00:20:04,407
This statue is at the end
of Ann Arbor Street erected by...

283
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,457
What did the General
tell you yesterday?

284
00:20:06,627 --> 00:20:09,877
- A Colonel. There were two of them.
- That makes a General.

285
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:11,381
They weren't too pleased.

286
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,215
You're gonna get audited this year.

287
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:17,760
Not me, you. I told them
I didn't want to do the story.

288
00:20:19,056 --> 00:20:21,677
- You always were yellow.
- Better than red.

289
00:20:28,815 --> 00:20:29,930
In 10 seconds.

290
00:20:34,404 --> 00:20:37,026
This is the sister,
Margaret Radulovich Fishman.

291
00:20:37,407 --> 00:20:40,574
She neither defends nor explains
her political activities.

292
00:20:40,786 --> 00:20:45,578
I feel that my activities,
be what they may...

293
00:20:45,665 --> 00:20:48,619
...or my political beliefs
are my own private affair.

294
00:20:49,127 --> 00:20:54,287
Are my children going to be asked
to denounce me?

295
00:20:54,382 --> 00:20:58,510
Are they going to be judged
on what their father was labeled?

296
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:03,881
Are they going to have to explain
to their friends, etc...

297
00:21:04,016 --> 00:21:06,056
...why their father
is a security risk?

298
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:11,889
I see, absolutely,
that this is a chain reaction.

299
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:16,568
If the thing is let stand as it,
the first recommendation...

300
00:21:16,654 --> 00:21:20,948
...was sent out by the board
I see a chain reaction...

301
00:21:21,033 --> 00:21:24,484
...that has no end to anybody,
for anybody.

302
00:21:25,371 --> 00:21:28,455
Perhaps you will permit me
to read a few sentences...

303
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,660
...because I would like to say
rather precisely what I mean.

304
00:21:32,086 --> 00:21:34,837
We have told the Air Force
that we will provide facilities...

305
00:21:34,922 --> 00:21:38,006
...for any comments, criticisms,
or corrections it may wish to make...

306
00:21:38,091 --> 00:21:40,084
...as to the case of Milo Radulovich.

307
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:44,886
We are unable to judge the charges
against his father or sister...

308
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:48,307
...because neither we, nor you,
nor they, nor the lawyers...

309
00:21:48,393 --> 00:21:52,438
...nor the Lieutenant, know what was
contained in that manila envelope.

310
00:21:53,148 --> 00:21:56,314
Was it hearsay,
rumor, gossip, slander...

311
00:21:56,568 --> 00:22:00,612
...or hard ascertainable facts that
could be backed by credible witnesses?

312
00:22:00,947 --> 00:22:02,145
We do not know.

313
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:06,276
We believe the son shall not bear
the iniquity of the father.

314
00:22:06,411 --> 00:22:09,910
Even though that iniquity be proved
and in this case it was not.

315
00:22:10,957 --> 00:22:14,242
But we believe too that this case
illustrates the urgent need...

316
00:22:14,335 --> 00:22:18,249
...for the Armed Forces to communicate
more fully than they have so far done...

317
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,794
...the procedures and regulations
to be followed...

318
00:22:20,883 --> 00:22:23,291
...in attempting to protect
the national security...

319
00:22:23,386 --> 00:22:26,137
...and the rights of the individual
at the same time.

320
00:22:27,223 --> 00:22:29,927
Whatever happens in this area
of the relationship...

321
00:22:30,017 --> 00:22:32,140
...between the individual
and the state...

322
00:22:32,228 --> 00:22:33,805
...we will do it ourselves...

323
00:22:34,355 --> 00:22:38,815
...it cannot be blamed on Malenkov
or Mao Tse-Tung or even our allies.

324
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:42,901
And, it seems to us,
Fred Friendly and myself...

325
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:46,904
...that this is a subject
that should be argued about endlessly.

326
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,367
Good night, and good luck.

327
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:58,415
And we'reout.

328
00:24:34,305 --> 00:24:34,722
May I tell you something
about yourself...

329
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:36,430
May I tellyou something
about yourself...

330
00:24:36,515 --> 00:24:38,923
...as a member
of the "Person to Person" audience?

331
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:41,094
Based on audience
research studies...

332
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:45,228
...you are well above average
in education and intelligence.

333
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:48,983
Your interests are wide,
from world affairs and science...

334
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:50,979
...to sports and show business.

335
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,530
And you have one characteristic
that's rather encouraging to me...

336
00:24:54,616 --> 00:24:58,531
...and that's the fact that you are
not easily persuaded by advertising.

337
00:24:59,288 --> 00:25:02,123
The makers of Kent considered
all these characteristics...

338
00:25:02,207 --> 00:25:04,365
...when they chose
Mr. Murrow'sprogram...

339
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:06,001
...to tell you about Kent.

340
00:25:06,253 --> 00:25:11,330
Of all leading filter cigarettes,
Kent filter's best.

341
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:14,711
If you try Kent with that in mind,
I think you'll agree...

342
00:25:14,803 --> 00:25:18,006
...with many other thinking people
who havec hanged to Kent.

343
00:25:18,348 --> 00:25:23,259
They find that it makes good sense
to smoke Kent and good smoking, too.

344
00:25:24,229 --> 00:25:27,514
- Did you get the changes?
- Edward Murrow, "Person to Person"...

345
00:25:27,607 --> 00:25:31,439
...on the CBS Television Network.
- No, no. You there? Okay. We got it.

346
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:33,105
Now back to Ed Murrow.

347
00:25:34,363 --> 00:25:37,281
Not since the silent movies
and the idols they produced...

348
00:25:37,366 --> 00:25:41,115
...has Hollywood witnessed the sort
of pilgrimage that is now going on.

349
00:25:41,621 --> 00:25:45,286
Each day, oblivious to time,
weather, and the state of the world...

350
00:25:45,458 --> 00:25:49,289
...sightseers head in the direction
of California's San Fernando Valley.

351
00:25:49,753 --> 00:25:53,004
For there, at the end
of the tourist line, is Sherman Oaks...

352
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:56,424
...and the home Liberace
has built for himself and his mother.

353
00:25:56,593 --> 00:26:00,461
This is the front and nobody knows
how many people have seen that view.

354
00:26:01,098 --> 00:26:04,348
This is the back of the house
and that's Liberace's bedroom.

355
00:26:05,352 --> 00:26:07,510
- Good evening, Lee.
- Good evening, Ed.

356
00:26:07,604 --> 00:26:12,349
- What are you doing? - I'm dictating
my weekly syndicated newspaper column...

357
00:26:12,818 --> 00:26:19,354
...and on my trusty tape recorder here,
I'm also dictating a book.

358
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:21,821
- It's an inspirational book.
- Lee, what about you?

359
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,911
Have you given much thought
to getting married and settling down?

360
00:26:24,996 --> 00:26:27,617
Actually, I've given
a lot of thought to it...

361
00:26:27,707 --> 00:26:31,621
...but I don't believe in getting married
just for the sake of getting married.

362
00:26:31,711 --> 00:26:34,416
I want to someday
find the perfect mate...

363
00:26:34,797 --> 00:26:38,877
...and settle down to what I hope will
be a marriage that will be blessed...

364
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,631
...by faith
and will be a lasting union.

365
00:26:42,138 --> 00:26:46,883
I was reading
about lovely young Princess Margaret...

366
00:26:47,435 --> 00:26:50,104
...and she's lookng
for her dream man, too...

367
00:26:50,688 --> 00:26:52,680
...and I hope she finds him someday.

368
00:26:54,066 --> 00:26:57,815
Uh-huh. Lee, thanks very much
for letting us come and visit you.

369
00:26:57,903 --> 00:26:59,066
It's been very pleasant.

370
00:26:59,155 --> 00:27:01,313
And will you say goodnight
to your family for us?

371
00:27:01,407 --> 00:27:03,115
- I certainly will.
- Thanks a lot.

372
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,027
- Good night, Ed.
- Good night, Lee.

373
00:27:06,495 --> 00:27:09,247
Next week, we'll take you
to Beverly Hills, California...

374
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:12,000
...to the house of Mickey Rooney
and his newbride.

375
00:27:12,084 --> 00:27:14,753
Until then,
good night, and good luck.

376
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:22,592
Good show, Mr. Murrow!

377
00:27:45,783 --> 00:27:47,028
Excuse me, Mr. Murrow.

378
00:27:47,118 --> 00:27:49,823
Could you take a look at this
and sign it for me, please?

379
00:27:49,912 --> 00:27:53,032
Thank you. Dr. Stanton
would like to have a drink with you.

380
00:27:53,124 --> 00:27:55,163
- When?
- Now. He's at the Pentagon Bar.

381
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:57,457
I can't. What the hell
is he doing there?

382
00:27:57,545 --> 00:28:00,415
- I believe he's waiting for you.
- Just call him! - Fine.

383
00:28:00,506 --> 00:28:03,175
- Oppenheimer next week.
- It's a good show, Ed.

384
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,339
- Hey, Don!
- Ed!

385
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:08,798
You're getting good at this!

386
00:28:09,348 --> 00:28:11,139
They're gonna think you like it!

387
00:28:11,308 --> 00:28:13,597
Pays the bills. How are you, Don?

388
00:28:14,895 --> 00:28:15,926
Ah, it's...

389
00:28:17,397 --> 00:28:18,596
...day today.

390
00:28:19,358 --> 00:28:22,275
If she saw how good you look
right now, she'd be back.

391
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,228
You tell her that
if you see her, will you?

392
00:28:27,741 --> 00:28:30,944
- I read the O'Brian piece.
- Yeah, it's tough.

393
00:28:31,787 --> 00:28:34,360
I'm a pinko.
I slant the news.

394
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:38,292
I'm just waiting for him
to say my wife left me too.

395
00:28:38,585 --> 00:28:41,502
- Nobody worth their salt reads him.
- You read him.

396
00:28:42,047 --> 00:28:43,706
Well, see, I rest my case.

397
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:49,672
- Does Paley read him?
- Bill Paley's not gonna do anything.

398
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:53,963
Thanks, Ed.

399
00:28:55,309 --> 00:28:58,595
I just came by to tell you
how great the Lieutenant piece was.

400
00:28:58,688 --> 00:29:01,891
- Thanks. - How's the fallout?
- Mostly good, surprisingly.

401
00:29:02,108 --> 00:29:04,895
Is this the start?
Are you taking sides?

402
00:29:07,488 --> 00:29:10,524
It's just a little poke
with a stick, see what happens.

403
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:12,491
You let me know if I can help.

404
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:14,160
But you're a pinko.

405
00:29:16,914 --> 00:29:18,159
I'll see you.

406
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:36,808
Hey, Joe! What's all this
Radulovich junk you're putting out?

407
00:29:36,892 --> 00:29:39,809
I can't talk to you now. I have
to get this film back to New York.

408
00:29:39,895 --> 00:29:41,223
What would you say if I told you...

409
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,886
...that Murrow was
on the Soviet payroll in 1935?

410
00:29:46,067 --> 00:29:49,152
- Uh! Charlie, you wanna...
- Sure. I'll set up outside.

411
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:52,905
McCarthy going
tot he Eisenhower dinner?

412
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:56,573
- I have no idea. Id on't keep the
Senator's calendar for him! - Really?

413
00:30:00,707 --> 00:30:04,407
Have you ever seen any spy films?
You don't hand me a classified folder!

414
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,625
You're supposed to slip it
into my briefcase!

415
00:30:06,712 --> 00:30:09,879
I didnt know who to give
this information to, Paley or Murrow.

416
00:30:09,966 --> 00:30:13,548
As you can imagine, Fred and I
aren't very friendly. No pun intended.

417
00:30:13,928 --> 00:30:15,422
No pun elocuted.

418
00:30:18,891 --> 00:30:20,884
- What do you got, Donald?
- In short?

419
00:30:21,143 --> 00:30:23,895
Murrows been a Communist
sympathizer since the 1930's.

420
00:30:23,979 --> 00:30:27,514
Member of the International Workers,
sponsored educational trips to Moscow...

421
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:30,146
...and on the Sovietpayroll
in 1935. It's all there.

422
00:30:30,235 --> 00:30:32,109
You wanna know
why that's not possible?

423
00:30:32,196 --> 00:30:33,690
Why you'll lose this one?

424
00:30:34,156 --> 00:30:36,148
Because everyone in this country...

425
00:30:36,241 --> 00:30:39,361
...knows that Ed Murrow
is a loyal American, he's apatriot.

426
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:44,081
Did you know the word "gullible"
isn't in the dictionary?

427
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:47,166
- Can I give this to him?
- I'd love it! I have copies!

428
00:30:50,255 --> 00:30:51,797
I think you guys go too far.

429
00:30:52,173 --> 00:30:54,499
Well, if it walks like a duck,
talks like a duck.

430
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:02,677
Yes, Mr. Paley.

431
00:31:03,685 --> 00:31:05,309
Right away.
Yes, sir.

432
00:31:07,021 --> 00:31:08,480
No, he hasn't called.

433
00:31:09,774 --> 00:31:13,606
Yes, sir, the second he calls.
If you're in a meeting, shall I?

434
00:31:14,946 --> 00:31:16,819
Yes, sir.
Of course, sir.

435
00:31:19,575 --> 00:31:20,654
Mr. Murrow!

436
00:31:21,535 --> 00:31:23,279
Mr. Paley will see you now.

437
00:31:27,124 --> 00:31:30,873
- Mr. Paley, Mr. Murrow is here.
- Thanks, Miss Mary.

438
00:31:31,462 --> 00:31:34,249
- Hello, Ed. - Bill...
- Sit over here, will you?

439
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:36,169
How's Janet?

440
00:31:36,592 --> 00:31:38,999
- Your son?
- All well, thanks. How's Babe?

441
00:31:39,136 --> 00:31:42,303
She's fine. Her fundraiser
got rained on, so...

442
00:31:42,723 --> 00:31:45,593
- Oh! That's why I never plan
on anything. - Really?

443
00:31:47,144 --> 00:31:48,389
You'd never know.

444
00:31:52,274 --> 00:31:53,554
Reading fiction?

445
00:31:54,192 --> 00:31:56,066
I hope so. You tell me.

446
00:31:57,487 --> 00:31:59,314
Now we know
how they're gonna come at us.

447
00:31:59,406 --> 00:32:02,323
That's just the first shot.
Somebody's going to go down.

448
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:05,030
Have you checked your facts?
Are you on safe ground?

449
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:10,201
- Bill, it's time. Show our cards.
- My cards.

450
00:32:11,042 --> 00:32:14,956
You lose, what happens?
5 guys find themselves out of work.

451
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,591
I'm responsible for a lot more
than 5 goddamn reporters. Let it go.

452
00:32:21,344 --> 00:32:23,502
McCarthy will self-destruct,
Cohn, all of them.

453
00:32:23,596 --> 00:32:26,051
You said Corporate
would not interfere with Editorial...

454
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,634
...and that the News
was to be left...

455
00:32:27,725 --> 00:32:29,516
We don't make the news,
we report the news.

456
00:32:29,602 --> 00:32:32,353
He's marked as Communists.

457
00:32:32,438 --> 00:32:34,477
If he goes too far,
the Senate will investigate him...

458
00:32:34,565 --> 00:32:35,561
...and we will report on that.

459
00:32:35,649 --> 00:32:38,935
He oversteps people's civil liberties.

460
00:32:39,028 --> 00:32:40,142
And you're trying him in the press?

461
00:32:40,237 --> 00:32:42,230
Does he get the right
to face his accuser?

462
00:32:42,323 --> 00:32:44,813
You've decided on this
and you're presenting it as fact.

463
00:32:44,908 --> 00:32:47,234
- What I am doing...
- I write your check.

464
00:32:47,327 --> 00:32:51,195
I put you in your country house,
and I put your son through school!

465
00:32:51,582 --> 00:32:55,200
You should have told me about this
before it went so far down the road!

466
00:33:06,721 --> 00:33:10,589
Everyone of your boys needs to be
clean. Do you understand? No ties.

467
00:33:10,809 --> 00:33:15,387
If Aaron's mother went to a group
fundraiser in 1932, he's out.

468
00:33:15,522 --> 00:33:19,305
Hewitt, too. Anyone in that room.
You make no mistake...

469
00:33:19,442 --> 00:33:23,060
...I will cut them loose. Corporate
won't interfere with Editorial.

470
00:33:23,154 --> 00:33:26,570
But Editorial will not jeopardize
the hundreds of employees...

471
00:33:26,657 --> 00:33:29,991
...of the CBS.
Do I make myself clear?

472
00:33:31,287 --> 00:33:32,567
Yes?

473
00:33:38,044 --> 00:33:41,412
Fellas, our next show is gonna be
about Senator McCarthy.

474
00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:44,298
And we'regonna go right at him.

475
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:47,712
I don't need to tell you
how careful we have to be.

476
00:33:47,803 --> 00:33:50,970
If we are to do this, Ed and I
need you to be straight with us.

477
00:33:51,056 --> 00:33:53,263
We need to know,
for the good of the piece...

478
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:57,182
...if any of you have any connection,
if you subscribed to a newsletter...

479
00:33:57,271 --> 00:33:59,144
...if you attended a party,
anything...

480
00:33:59,231 --> 00:34:02,397
...anything that could compromise this,
anything at all...

481
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:05,185
...because now would be
the time to tell us.

482
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,651
Ed, I think I should excuse myself.

483
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,079
Palmer, you kidding?

484
00:34:16,039 --> 00:34:18,577
My ex was a...
I wouldn't say she was a Communist...

485
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:21,751
...but she attended meetings.
It was before we were married.

486
00:34:21,836 --> 00:34:24,790
I didn't even really know about it
until after the divorce.

487
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,340
But it was different then.
We were all on the same side.

488
00:34:29,844 --> 00:34:32,798
I'm not telling you anything
you don't know. The thing is...

489
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:34,347
...somebody'll find out.

490
00:34:36,058 --> 00:34:37,553
They'll hurt us with it.

491
00:34:39,103 --> 00:34:41,559
I should have told you sooner, Ed,
I'm sorry.

492
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:43,805
Fred.

493
00:34:47,027 --> 00:34:49,697
If none of us had ever read
a "dangerous" book...

494
00:34:49,905 --> 00:34:52,064
...or had a friend
who was "different"...

495
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:54,827
...or never joined an organization
that advocated "change"...

496
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:57,745
...we'd all be the kindof people
Joe McCarthy wants.

497
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:03,325
We're gonna go with the story,
because the terror is in this room.

498
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:09,628
John! Jesse!
Go through the HUAC hearings.

499
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:13,630
Eddie! Palmer! Look at who
did the interviews and any speeches.

500
00:35:14,638 --> 00:35:16,262
Okay, fellas, here we go.

501
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,841
His own words,
that's what we need.

502
00:35:18,934 --> 00:35:21,471
...said that he wouldn't remove
a General from the Army...

503
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:24,562
...who supported a Communist Major.
I said, "Then, General..."

504
00:35:24,647 --> 00:35:26,973
"...you should be removed
from any command."

505
00:35:27,484 --> 00:35:31,267
"Any man who says, "I will protect
and honor a General'..."

506
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:35,858
"...'who protects Communists', is not
fit to wear that uniform, General."

507
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:37,783
Ethically, we're fine.

508
00:35:37,952 --> 00:35:41,701
But legally, if we air this, are we
leaking closed hearing testimony?

509
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:44,197
- But he chose to read it.
- We're not misquoting him.

510
00:35:44,292 --> 00:35:47,707
- There are other reporters.
- If it's a legal issue, it's his.

511
00:35:47,795 --> 00:35:49,170
I'll check with Campbell in Legal.

512
00:35:49,255 --> 00:35:51,294
And wait till you hear
the bleeding hearts...

513
00:35:51,757 --> 00:35:53,880
...scream and cry about our methods...

514
00:35:55,094 --> 00:35:57,133
...of trying to drag the truth...

515
00:35:58,722 --> 00:36:00,881
...from those who know
or should know...

516
00:36:01,725 --> 00:36:04,679
...who covered up
a Fifth Amendment Communist Major.

517
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:06,938
But they say, "Oh..."

518
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,937
"...it's all right to uncover them,
but don't get rough doing it, McCarthy."

519
00:36:14,029 --> 00:36:18,572
Did a Civil Liberties Union provide
you with an attorney at that time?

520
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:21,201
I had many offers of attorneys...

521
00:36:21,286 --> 00:36:25,200
...and from the American Civil Liberties
Union, too. - The question is:

522
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,244
...did the Civil Liberties Union
supply you with an attorney?

523
00:36:28,335 --> 00:36:30,908
- They did supply an attorney.
- The answer is yes?

524
00:36:31,046 --> 00:36:32,041
The answer is yes.

525
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,621
You know the Civil Liberties Union
has been listed...

526
00:36:34,716 --> 00:36:37,919
...as a front for and doing the work
of the Communist Party?

527
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:40,385
Mr. Chairman, this was 1932!

528
00:36:41,806 --> 00:36:43,134
I know this was in 1932.

529
00:36:43,224 --> 00:36:45,382
Do you know that they since
have been listed...

530
00:36:45,476 --> 00:36:48,014
...as a front for and doing the work
of the Communist Party?

531
00:36:48,104 --> 00:36:50,346
I do not know
that they have been listedso, sir.

532
00:36:50,439 --> 00:36:52,812
- You don't know?
- I have heard that mentioned...

533
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,145
All right, Leo. Turn it off.

534
00:36:54,235 --> 00:36:58,019
- I need those three cans of Stevens!
- Has anybody read this book yet?

535
00:36:58,114 --> 00:37:00,439
It would be nice
if this guy isn't a Commie.

536
00:37:00,533 --> 00:37:02,940
- Did Millie give it to you?
- I wanna read the book.

537
00:37:03,035 --> 00:37:04,613
- Nobody else, Joe.
- I hear you, boss.

538
00:37:04,703 --> 00:37:07,029
I'll put it on a kinescope,
push through the end.

539
00:37:07,122 --> 00:37:08,320
Palmer, cut it at 2:30.

540
00:37:08,415 --> 00:37:10,787
I prefer it one on each end,
let it run through.

541
00:37:10,876 --> 00:37:12,703
It'd be more powerful.
Cut Kennedy?

542
00:37:12,795 --> 00:37:15,630
Joe, file it for me.
I'll see the Mundt piece later.

543
00:37:15,881 --> 00:37:17,256
Are we gonna make it, Fred?

544
00:37:17,591 --> 00:37:19,749
We lost the telecine,
but we'll make it.

545
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,089
Did you finish your closing piece?

546
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:27,047
It's Shakespeare.

547
00:37:28,935 --> 00:37:30,264
Write your closing.

548
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,090
My argument was if you just show
the images of McCarthy...

549
00:38:02,176 --> 00:38:03,718
...it doesn't make any difference.

550
00:38:03,803 --> 00:38:06,091
If you agree with him,
you're gonna hate the piece.

551
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,211
If you don't, you'll love it.

552
00:38:07,306 --> 00:38:09,299
Maybe they should wait
till they get more footage.

553
00:38:09,391 --> 00:38:10,886
I don't think
wec an take that chance.

554
00:38:10,976 --> 00:38:13,598
We've got to hit McCarthy
before he comes after Ed.

555
00:38:15,356 --> 00:38:18,725
The blue one. They haven't gone
after the AIsops or Herb Block.

556
00:38:18,942 --> 00:38:21,730
Honey, the AIsops and Herb Block...

557
00:38:22,404 --> 00:38:26,069
...didn't work for the Institute
of International Education in 1934.

558
00:38:26,867 --> 00:38:28,242
Then I guess it's time.

559
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:36,538
You worried?

560
00:38:39,337 --> 00:38:40,713
I didn't think I was.

561
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:44,002
I don't know why.
I was in the office on Friday.

562
00:38:44,342 --> 00:38:47,379
And I answered the phone,
it was Howard calling from London.

563
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:49,926
And he asked what was going on
with McCarthy.

564
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:55,347
And before I answered him, I turned
and looked over my shoulder...

565
00:38:55,687 --> 00:38:58,557
...tosee who was listening.
- And who was listening?

566
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,598
Chairman Mao...

567
00:39:07,907 --> 00:39:09,366
I'll see you at the office.

568
00:39:10,326 --> 00:39:11,950
- Hey, your ring!
- Uh!

569
00:39:15,247 --> 00:39:16,706
Name me another wife...

570
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:19,918
...who reminds her husband
to take off his wedding ring...

571
00:39:20,002 --> 00:39:23,205
...before he goes to the office.
- Ava Gardner.

572
00:39:30,554 --> 00:39:34,302
Excuse me, Mr. Friendly. Mr. Murrow,
Mr. Paley's on the line for you.

573
00:39:36,393 --> 00:39:40,011
- Maybe he wants to reimburse us
for those ads. - You'd like that!

574
00:39:40,355 --> 00:39:42,229
- I would like that!
- This is Ed.

575
00:39:42,524 --> 00:39:45,940
There's a Knickerbocker game tonight.
I've got front row seats.

576
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:47,433
Are you interested?

577
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,233
I'm busy bringing down
the network tonight, Bill.

578
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:52,529
Is that tonight?

579
00:39:54,244 --> 00:39:55,524
We're covered, Bill.

580
00:39:56,454 --> 00:39:57,533
All right.

581
00:39:59,457 --> 00:40:04,166
- I'm with you today, Ed, and I'm
with you tomorrow. - Thanks, Bill.

582
00:40:19,935 --> 00:40:22,224
Do you know the timing
on the first piece?

583
00:40:23,773 --> 00:40:25,682
Can we hold all the calls, please?

584
00:40:25,941 --> 00:40:28,148
Hold the calls till after the show.
Thank you.

585
00:40:28,569 --> 00:40:30,692
- You fellas, awake down there?
- Okay.

586
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,817
- Just... what are we? 20?
- 30 seconds, Ed.

587
00:40:49,714 --> 00:40:50,995
10 seconds.

588
00:40:55,303 --> 00:40:59,882
5, 4,3, 2.

589
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:02,726
And pan, camera one.

590
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,848
Because a report on Senator McCarthy
is by definition controversial...

591
00:41:10,276 --> 00:41:12,601
...we want to say exactly
what we mean to say...

592
00:41:12,695 --> 00:41:15,447
...and request your permission
to read from a script...

593
00:41:15,531 --> 00:41:18,069
...what ever remarks Murrow
and Friendly may make.

594
00:41:18,618 --> 00:41:22,402
If the Senator feels that we have done
violence to his words or pictures...

595
00:41:22,496 --> 00:41:24,738
...and desires to answer himself...

596
00:41:24,915 --> 00:41:27,786
...an opportunity will be afforded him
on this program.

597
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,784
Our working thesis tonight
is this quotation:

598
00:41:31,505 --> 00:41:33,165
..."If this fight
against Communism..."

599
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:36,590
"...has made a fight between
America's two great political parties..."

600
00:41:36,677 --> 00:41:40,176
"...the American people know that one
of these parties will be destroyed..."

601
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:43,715
"...and the Republic cannot endure
very long as a one-party system."

602
00:41:44,184 --> 00:41:45,762
We applaud that statement...

603
00:41:45,853 --> 00:41:48,094
...and we think
Senator McCarthy ought to.

604
00:41:48,313 --> 00:41:50,638
He said it
17 months ago in Milwaukee.

605
00:41:51,692 --> 00:41:55,061
The American people realize
that this cannot be made a fight...

606
00:41:55,195 --> 00:41:57,816
...between America's
two great political parties.

607
00:41:57,906 --> 00:41:59,530
If this fight against Communism...

608
00:41:59,616 --> 00:42:02,819
...is made a fight against America's
two great political parties...

609
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:06,529
...the American people know that one
of those parties will be destroyed...

610
00:42:06,623 --> 00:42:10,039
...and the Republic can't endure
very long as a one-party system.

611
00:42:10,877 --> 00:42:13,498
On one thing the Senator
has been consistent.

612
00:42:14,047 --> 00:42:17,380
Often operating as a one-man
committee, he has traveled far...

613
00:42:17,467 --> 00:42:19,673
...interviewed many,
terrorized some...

614
00:42:20,178 --> 00:42:22,217
...accused civilian
and military leaders...

615
00:42:22,305 --> 00:42:24,760
...of the past administration
of a great conspiracy...

616
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:26,842
...to turn over the country
to Communism.

617
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:31,347
I was extremely shocked when I heard
that Secretary Stevens...

618
00:42:31,856 --> 00:42:36,185
...told 2 Army officers that they had
to take part in the cover up...

619
00:42:36,694 --> 00:42:39,267
...of those who promoted
and coddled Communists.

620
00:42:39,488 --> 00:42:42,406
As I read his statement, I...

621
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:46,368
...thought of that quotation,
"On what meat..."

622
00:42:47,121 --> 00:42:49,279
"...does this our Caesar feed?".

623
00:42:49,415 --> 00:42:50,410
The questions is:

624
00:42:50,499 --> 00:42:53,535
...did the Civil Liberties Union
supply you with an attorney?

625
00:42:53,627 --> 00:42:56,200
- They did supply an attorney.
- The answer is yes?

626
00:42:56,296 --> 00:42:57,292
The answer is yes.

627
00:42:57,381 --> 00:43:00,132
Do you think this book
did considerable harm?

628
00:43:00,342 --> 00:43:01,753
Its publication...

629
00:43:02,844 --> 00:43:05,549
...by an expression of the views
contained in it?

630
00:43:05,847 --> 00:43:09,181
The sale of that book
was so abysmally small...

631
00:43:09,684 --> 00:43:14,062
...it was so unsuccessful,
that the question of its influence...

632
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:16,307
You can go back
to the publisher...

633
00:43:16,399 --> 00:43:20,064
...you'll see it was one of the most
unsuccessful books he ever put out.

634
00:43:20,153 --> 00:43:22,311
He's still sorry about it,
just as I am.

635
00:43:22,614 --> 00:43:25,817
Well, I think that's a compliment
to American intelligence.

636
00:43:26,701 --> 00:43:27,816
I'll say that.

637
00:43:28,494 --> 00:43:32,195
The Reed Harris hearing demonstrates
one of the Senator's techniques.

638
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:33,535
Twice he said...

639
00:43:33,791 --> 00:43:37,658
...'The American Civil Liberties Union
was listed as a subversive front."

640
00:43:37,753 --> 00:43:40,754
The Attorney General's list does not
and never has listed...

641
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,675
...the ACLU as subversive,
nor does the FBI...

642
00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:46,001
...or any other
federal government agency.

643
00:43:46,345 --> 00:43:49,465
And the American Civil Liberties Union
holds in its files...

644
00:43:49,557 --> 00:43:52,178
...letters of commendation
from President Truman...

645
00:43:52,268 --> 00:43:54,889
...President Eisenhower,
and General MacArthur.

646
00:43:55,938 --> 00:44:00,398
Earlier, the Senator asked, "Upon what
meat does this our Caesar feed?".

647
00:44:00,692 --> 00:44:03,397
Had he looked three lines earlier
in Shakespeare's "Caesar"...

648
00:44:03,487 --> 00:44:07,069
...he would have found this line,
which is not altogether inappropriate.

649
00:44:07,157 --> 00:44:11,451
"The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves."

650
00:44:12,162 --> 00:44:14,404
No one familiar with the history
of this country...

651
00:44:14,498 --> 00:44:17,202
...can deny that Congressional
committees are useful.

652
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:20,162
It is necessary to investigate
before legislating...

653
00:44:20,253 --> 00:44:23,836
...but the line between investigating
and persecuting is a very fine one...

654
00:44:23,923 --> 00:44:27,791
...and the junior Senator from Wisconsin
has stepped over it repeatedly.

655
00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:30,542
We must not confuse dissent
with disloyalty.

656
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:34,223
We must remember always
that accusation is not proof...

657
00:44:34,517 --> 00:44:38,266
...and that conviction depends
upon evidence and due process of law.

658
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:41,519
We will not walk in fear,
one of another.

659
00:44:41,607 --> 00:44:44,478
We will not be driven by fear
into an age of unreason...

660
00:44:44,569 --> 00:44:47,238
...if we dig deep
in our history and doctrine...

661
00:44:47,446 --> 00:44:50,732
...and remember that we are not
descended from fearful men...

662
00:44:50,908 --> 00:44:54,443
...not from men who feared to write,
to associate, to speak...

663
00:44:54,537 --> 00:44:57,952
...and to defend the causes
that were for the moment unpopular.

664
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:01,909
This is no time for men who oppose
Senator McCarthy's methods...

665
00:45:02,002 --> 00:45:04,576
...to keep silent,
or for those who approve.

666
00:45:05,297 --> 00:45:07,835
Wec an deny our heritage
and our history...

667
00:45:07,925 --> 00:45:10,712
...but we cannot escape
responsibility for the results.

668
00:45:11,303 --> 00:45:13,592
We proclaim ourselves,
indeed as we are...

669
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,630
...the defenders of freedom wherever
it continues to exist in the world...

670
00:45:17,726 --> 00:45:21,225
...but we cannot defend freedom abroad
by deserting it at home.

671
00:45:21,855 --> 00:45:24,180
The actions of the junior Senator
from Wisconsin...

672
00:45:24,274 --> 00:45:27,275
...have caused alarm and dismay
amongst our allies abroad...

673
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,898
...and given considerable comfort
to our enemies.

674
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:33,447
And whose fault is that?
Not really his.

675
00:45:33,908 --> 00:45:36,233
He didn't create
this situation of fear...

676
00:45:36,494 --> 00:45:39,495
...he merely exploited it,
and rather successfully.

677
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,369
Cassius was right.

678
00:45:42,917 --> 00:45:47,294
"The fault, dear Brutus, is not
in our stars, but in ourselves."

679
00:45:48,297 --> 00:45:50,373
Good night, and good luck.

680
00:45:58,099 --> 00:45:59,213
And we're out.

681
00:46:12,863 --> 00:46:13,894
Nothing?

682
00:46:17,117 --> 00:46:18,611
Maybe nobody watched.

683
00:46:23,707 --> 00:46:26,079
- We got nothing.
- I don't know. - Nothing.

684
00:46:26,585 --> 00:46:29,158
Should I turn the phones back on,
Mr. Williams?

685
00:46:30,672 --> 00:46:33,044
Yes. Now would be
a good time for that.

686
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,958
Turn the phones on!
Turn the pho...

687
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,344
Mr. Friendly wants the phones on.

688
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,173
It's the Junior Senator
calling collect.

689
00:46:40,265 --> 00:46:43,515
Don't kid yourself. It's Reed Harris
thanking us for mentioning him.

690
00:46:43,601 --> 00:46:46,602
I don't know whether all of you
have seen what I just saw...

691
00:46:46,688 --> 00:46:49,392
...but I want to associate myself
and this program...

692
00:46:49,482 --> 00:46:51,107
...with what Ed Murrow
has just said...

693
00:46:51,192 --> 00:46:53,944
...and say I have never been
prouder of CBS.

694
00:46:56,823 --> 00:47:00,903
Senator McCarthy said today that he
would demand equal free television...

695
00:47:05,706 --> 00:47:09,620
Stevenson had charged that the Senator
made demagoguery and deceit...

696
00:47:09,877 --> 00:47:11,668
...the national policy...

697
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,498
- Is that Hollenbeck?
- Congratulations!

698
00:47:16,592 --> 00:47:17,623
Great show!

699
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:19,749
Feel like a Scotch?

700
00:47:20,345 --> 00:47:22,421
I think everybody
could use a Scotch.

701
00:48:14,106 --> 00:48:17,309
- It's 3:30, early editions are out.
- I'm not worried about that.

702
00:48:17,401 --> 00:48:19,061
Of course not.
Shirley, honey...

703
00:48:19,153 --> 00:48:22,107
...would you go across the street
and get the early editions?

704
00:48:22,197 --> 00:48:24,155
- All of them?
- Just get O'Brian!

705
00:48:26,785 --> 00:48:28,694
- Hey, watch my drink!
- Yeah.

706
00:49:01,069 --> 00:49:02,895
Okay. Here we go.

707
00:49:03,488 --> 00:49:06,405
- At last!
- The Times. - The Times...

708
00:49:06,532 --> 00:49:07,564
- First?
- Good.

709
00:49:08,242 --> 00:49:10,069
- Who wrote it?
- Jack Gould.

710
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,948
Gould...

711
00:49:12,455 --> 00:49:15,954
Edward R. Murrows television program
on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy...

712
00:49:16,042 --> 00:49:19,873
...was an exciting and provocative
examination of the man and his methods.

713
00:49:19,962 --> 00:49:23,497
It was crusading journalism
of high responsibility and courage.

714
00:49:23,591 --> 00:49:26,342
For TV so often plagued
by timidity and hesitation...

715
00:49:26,427 --> 00:49:30,211
...the program was a milestone
that reflected enlightened citizenship.

716
00:49:30,347 --> 00:49:31,592
The program... Hold on!

717
00:49:31,682 --> 00:49:34,469
The program was no less
an indictment of those who wish...

718
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:37,644
...the problems posed
by the Senator's tactics and theatrics...

719
00:49:37,729 --> 00:49:39,722
...would just go away
and leave them alone.

720
00:49:39,815 --> 00:49:42,769
That was Mr. Murrows
and television's triumph...

721
00:49:42,859 --> 00:49:44,402
...and a very great one.

722
00:49:47,781 --> 00:49:48,896
Here! Here!

723
00:49:49,074 --> 00:49:51,197
- He hated it.
- Yeah. What's his beef?

724
00:49:51,827 --> 00:49:53,700
Send the New YorkTimes
abottle of Scotch.

725
00:49:53,787 --> 00:49:55,826
I already did. How do you think
we got that review?

726
00:49:55,914 --> 00:49:57,871
- How's the Post?
- Pretty good!

727
00:49:58,583 --> 00:50:00,576
- What about O'Brian?
- Uh, the same.

728
00:50:02,087 --> 00:50:05,123
- Goon, read O'Brian!
- I don't have it.

729
00:50:05,215 --> 00:50:06,673
- Got it.
- Oh. Here.

730
00:50:08,927 --> 00:50:10,800
- There we go.
- Shirley, that...

731
00:50:14,432 --> 00:50:18,015
We can't say we were surprised at
Murrows "Hate McCarthy" telecast...

732
00:50:18,102 --> 00:50:21,056
...last evening, when his explosively
one-sided propaganda...

733
00:50:21,147 --> 00:50:24,480
...edited with deviously clever
selectivity from McCarthy's march...

734
00:50:24,567 --> 00:50:26,974
...against Communism,
was finished last evening...

735
00:50:27,069 --> 00:50:30,485
...by equally Machiavellian coincidence
the following telecast...

736
00:50:30,573 --> 00:50:33,573
...featured Murrow's PM protege,
Hollenbeck.

737
00:50:34,326 --> 00:50:36,698
In an obviously gloating mood,
Hollenbeck...

738
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:40,238
...hoped viewers had witnessed
his patron's triumph...

739
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:41,661
...from and for the Left.

740
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:44,033
Soon. Soon...

741
00:50:44,128 --> 00:50:46,250
Shirley, it's okay.
Go ahead, finish it.

742
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:49,505
- No, that's it. That's it.
- Shirley, please, finish it.

743
00:50:52,678 --> 00:50:57,339
The CBS has been in a lengthy
"clean house of Lefties" mood.

744
00:50:57,432 --> 00:50:59,140
The worst offenders
on lesser levels...

745
00:50:59,226 --> 00:51:01,432
...have been quietly
pushed out of the company.

746
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:05,469
Don Hollenbeck, a graduate
of the demised pinko publication PM...

747
00:51:05,565 --> 00:51:09,349
...attacked conservative papers
with sly and slanted propaganda.

748
00:51:09,444 --> 00:51:11,769
He then proceeded
through an equally...

749
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:15,406
...tilted review of the day's events...

750
00:51:15,491 --> 00:51:18,860
...with McCarthy dominating his words,
actions, attitudes.

751
00:51:19,829 --> 00:51:20,825
Soon.

752
00:51:23,624 --> 00:51:26,542
- It's O'Brian. - He didn't get
the Scotch, that's all.

753
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:30,039
- Is it grammatically correct?
- I'll have that cigarette, Ed.

754
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:34,627
- Thanks, Shirley.
- Oh. - Mmh. - Thank you.

755
00:51:34,802 --> 00:51:37,091
Joe... Shirley...

756
00:51:42,017 --> 00:51:43,298
It doesn't matter.

757
00:51:48,565 --> 00:51:49,680
To Jack Gould!

758
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:53,688
- To Jack! To Jack! To Jack Gould!
- To Jack Gould!

759
00:51:53,779 --> 00:51:54,775
I love Jack Gould!

760
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,282
May he rest in peace.

761
00:52:00,494 --> 00:52:03,329
- Hello, Jimmy.
- Fred, congratulations! - Thank you.

762
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:06,494
I got such a hangover
to go along with the ulcer.

763
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:08,457
All the adguys on the 3rd floor
watched the show.

764
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:10,536
Got a good review
in the New York Times. Jack Gould.

765
00:52:10,629 --> 00:52:12,004
We're putting out a press release...

766
00:52:12,088 --> 00:52:14,959
...saying that calls came in
15 to 1 in favor of the show. - Really?

767
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,422
- Yeah. - 15 to 1?
- We got calls from everywhere.

768
00:52:17,719 --> 00:52:21,052
- East Coast or West Coast?
- Yeah. Kansas City, Cincinnati...

769
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:23,171
Mr. Paley...

770
00:52:24,267 --> 00:52:26,425
- Morning, Fred.
- Morning, Mr. Paley.

771
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:32,561
How's your wife?

772
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:35,184
She's fine.
We're getting ready to move.

773
00:52:35,278 --> 00:52:38,362
- Really? Where to? - Riverdale.
We found a nice house there.

774
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:39,443
It's nice there.

775
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:41,362
Yes, sir.

776
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,411
Excuse me.

777
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:53,457
Fred! McCarthy wants William Buckey
to do his rebuttal.

778
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:55,792
I said no.

779
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,622
Yes, sir.

780
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,011
Hey, Johnny!

781
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,508
- Radulovich has been reinstated.
- What?!

782
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,353
Radulovich... Guys!
Radulovich has been reinstated.

783
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,312
- Jesse! Jesse!
- Where is Ed?

784
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:15,936
- He's in the bullpen. Why?
What's going on? - Jess!

785
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,520
Got some very good news.

786
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:21,237
Special announcement
from the Secretary of the Air Force!

787
00:53:21,322 --> 00:53:23,362
Fellas! Listen up! Everyone!

788
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,359
I have decided
that it is consistent...

789
00:53:26,452 --> 00:53:29,204
...with the interests
of the National Security to retain...

790
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:32,574
...Lieutenant Radulovich
in the United States Air Force. Stop.

791
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:36,084
He is not, in my opinion,
a security risk. Fullstop.

792
00:53:38,714 --> 00:53:42,333
There you go. Harold E. Talbott,
Secretary from the Air Force.

793
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:44,006
Great job!

794
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,004
- Make a copy of that for me!
- I will do, Fred!

795
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,054
Back to work, guys!
We got a lot of work to do.

796
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,385
This means something.

797
00:53:49,475 --> 00:53:51,053
- Good news, huh?
- Congratulations!

798
00:53:51,143 --> 00:53:55,188
- This absolutely means something.
- Absolutely. This is the start of...

799
00:54:02,196 --> 00:54:03,191
Palmer!

800
00:54:06,283 --> 00:54:08,322
The CBS lawyers wanna talk to you.

801
00:54:11,913 --> 00:54:12,945
When?

802
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:14,655
Tomorrow.

803
00:54:15,584 --> 00:54:18,953
I don't want you to get paranoid,
they're talking to everybody.

804
00:54:19,045 --> 00:54:20,077
Any ideas?

805
00:54:21,673 --> 00:54:23,298
Just tell them what you know.

806
00:54:23,383 --> 00:54:26,088
- Now is that testimony true?
- No, sir, it is not.

807
00:54:26,177 --> 00:54:29,381
Not at any time have I been
a member of the Communist Party...

808
00:54:29,472 --> 00:54:31,797
...and I have never seen
a Communist card.

809
00:54:31,891 --> 00:54:34,216
- You've never seen a Communist card?
- That's right.

810
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:36,267
Have you ever attended
any Communist meetings?

811
00:54:36,354 --> 00:54:37,978
No, sir, never.

812
00:54:38,064 --> 00:54:40,306
Have you ever subscribed
to The Daily Worker?

813
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,184
No, sir. I didn't subscribe to it
and I wouldn't pay for it.

814
00:54:44,987 --> 00:54:50,195
Uh... Now, Mrs. Markward,
who was working for the FBI...

815
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:54,243
...who joined the Communist Party
under orders from the FBI...

816
00:54:54,372 --> 00:54:57,538
...has testified that while
she never met you personally...

817
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:00,953
...at a Communist meeting
that your name was on the list...

818
00:55:01,045 --> 00:55:03,203
...of Communists
who were paying dues.

819
00:55:03,714 --> 00:55:06,466
Uh... Can you shed
any light upon that?

820
00:55:07,343 --> 00:55:10,213
No, sir. I don't even know
what the dues are...

821
00:55:10,387 --> 00:55:13,886
...or where they were paid.
- So you have never paid any money...

822
00:55:14,933 --> 00:55:16,760
...to the Communist Party.

823
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:19,227
- Is that correct?
- That's right.

824
00:55:19,396 --> 00:55:21,519
You've never paid
any dues, payment...

825
00:55:21,606 --> 00:55:23,266
Thank you very much, Leo!

826
00:55:24,192 --> 00:55:26,019
Good work, Joe, Charlie.

827
00:55:26,653 --> 00:55:27,981
Now what is the show?

828
00:55:28,071 --> 00:55:30,823
Is it defending Annie Lee Moss
as not being a Communist?

829
00:55:30,907 --> 00:55:33,481
- Or is ither Constitutional rights?
- Both. - The latter.

830
00:55:33,576 --> 00:55:36,032
We're much better sticking out
the Constitutional issues.

831
00:55:36,121 --> 00:55:37,829
- Agreed?
- The woman is not a Communist spy.

832
00:55:37,914 --> 00:55:40,535
Joe McCarthy said that they have
a spy in the Pentagon...

833
00:55:40,625 --> 00:55:42,333
...that spy has gotten
into the code room...

834
00:55:42,418 --> 00:55:44,162
...and that that spy
is Annie Lee Moss.

835
00:55:44,254 --> 00:55:46,745
I've got New York Times reports.
McCarthy asserts he has...

836
00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:49,674
...a new red link to Army. Quote,
"Senator McCarthy charged today..."

837
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:52,297
"...that the Army now employs
a woman in its code room..."

838
00:55:52,386 --> 00:55:54,960
"...who was, and still may be,
an active Communist."

839
00:55:55,056 --> 00:55:56,550
It's the front page
of the New York Times.

840
00:55:56,641 --> 00:56:00,306
No sooner is he done chastising the
other committee members for wanting...

841
00:56:00,394 --> 00:56:03,348
...to push into the afternoon,
than what? Seven questions in...

842
00:56:03,439 --> 00:56:05,063
...he ducks out, leaves...
- Right.

843
00:56:05,149 --> 00:56:08,150
- Heleaves. - It's all over
the headlines, all over the country.

844
00:56:08,235 --> 00:56:09,813
Get me copies from any newspaper...

845
00:56:09,904 --> 00:56:11,528
...that printed anything
about that assertion.

846
00:56:11,614 --> 00:56:14,947
That's a good idea. You should get
the Cincinnati Inquirer.

847
00:56:15,034 --> 00:56:18,070
- Chicago. - Couple other pieces
I think we should include.

848
00:56:18,162 --> 00:56:21,281
The fact that there's 3 Annie Lee Moss's
in the phone book.

849
00:56:21,373 --> 00:56:24,409
There are 2 Robert Halls,
one's colored, one's white.

850
00:56:24,501 --> 00:56:26,410
We have some footage
of the empty chair.

851
00:56:26,503 --> 00:56:29,670
I think that says it all.
Just that picture of McCarthy not...

852
00:56:29,756 --> 00:56:32,591
McCarthy leaving the hearing
after 7 questions...

853
00:56:32,676 --> 00:56:34,834
...and then we'll cut
to the shot of thechair.

854
00:56:34,928 --> 00:56:37,597
- We gotta do something about it.
- All right, so...

855
00:56:37,681 --> 00:56:41,548
Excuse me. Mr. Murrow!
McCarthy wants April 6th.

856
00:56:45,355 --> 00:56:46,635
Thank you, Natalie.

857
00:56:51,277 --> 00:56:54,527
Fine. If Charlie shoots it, we get
to see it first. We should offer.

858
00:56:54,614 --> 00:56:57,187
- It's a long shot.
- What the hell could McCarthy do?

859
00:56:57,283 --> 00:56:59,774
Is he gonna debate himself?
We just used his words!

860
00:57:03,122 --> 00:57:05,328
Johnny! Johnny! We know
what it's going to be.

861
00:57:05,416 --> 00:57:08,417
He's going to come after me.
There's nothing more he can do.

862
00:57:08,502 --> 00:57:10,993
He's gonna bet that
a Senator trumps a newsman.

863
00:57:11,922 --> 00:57:12,954
He'll lose.

864
00:57:13,382 --> 00:57:15,007
Not if we're playing bridge.

865
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:19,589
- I'm sorry, guys. I didn't mean
to interrupt. - Hey, Don.

866
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,838
- It's getting fun now!
- Ed, you have aminute?

867
00:57:22,308 --> 00:57:25,926
- Yes, I'll be right there.
- All right, boys. Playtime's over.

868
00:57:26,311 --> 00:57:27,687
We have 4 days...

869
00:57:27,938 --> 00:57:30,429
...to do a 29 minute show.
- Yeah. - All right.

870
00:57:30,524 --> 00:57:31,983
All right, go ahead.
Hi, Mary.

871
00:57:32,067 --> 00:57:33,775
Hello, Mr. Hollenbeck.
Mr. Murrow...

872
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,687
- Could you give us a moment?
- Sure.

873
00:57:37,572 --> 00:57:38,652
Thank you, dear.

874
00:57:40,408 --> 00:57:43,113
I have to ask you something, Ed.
It's about O'Brian.

875
00:57:43,203 --> 00:57:45,112
- O'Brian doesn'tmatter.
- He's killing me, Ed.

876
00:57:45,205 --> 00:57:46,996
He doesn't amount to that much
in the newsroom.

877
00:57:47,082 --> 00:57:48,492
We've got to let that guy have it.

878
00:57:48,583 --> 00:57:51,869
We're not going after O'Brian. I will
not take on McCarthy and Hearst.

879
00:57:51,961 --> 00:57:53,242
I can't defeat them both.

880
00:57:54,339 --> 00:57:57,624
Just don't read the papers.
Or don't read O'Brian, anyway.

881
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:05,136
Okay. I guess not.

882
00:58:06,434 --> 00:58:07,513
Sorry, Don.

883
00:58:21,615 --> 00:58:23,489
Although Mrs. Moss
offered to testify...

884
00:58:23,576 --> 00:58:26,695
...Senator McCarthy suggested
that she was too sick.

885
00:58:26,787 --> 00:58:30,488
- She agreed... - Mr. Cohn wanted
to know about Mrs. Moss's connection...

886
00:58:30,582 --> 00:58:34,247
...to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth...

887
00:58:34,336 --> 00:58:35,499
...so help you God?

888
00:58:39,299 --> 00:58:41,969
May we get your full name
for the record, please?

889
00:58:42,344 --> 00:58:43,672
Annie Lee Moss.

890
00:58:44,805 --> 00:58:46,465
- M-O-S-S?
- That's right.

891
00:58:46,807 --> 00:58:50,057
Mrs. Moss, let me say for the record,
for your information...

892
00:58:50,143 --> 00:58:52,349
...for the information
of your counsel...

893
00:58:52,854 --> 00:58:54,811
...that you are not here because...

894
00:58:56,149 --> 00:59:01,190
...you are considered important
in the Communist apparatus.

895
00:59:01,321 --> 00:59:04,820
We have the testimony that you are,
and have been, a Communist.

896
00:59:06,034 --> 00:59:09,403
We are rather curious, however,
to kno whow you suddenly...

897
00:59:10,705 --> 00:59:12,116
...were shifted from...

898
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:17,078
...a worker in a cafeteria
to the code room.

899
00:59:17,378 --> 00:59:20,664
I am today much more interested...

900
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:25,124
...in the handling of your case...

901
00:59:25,886 --> 00:59:29,089
...by your superiors
than in your own personal activities.

902
00:59:29,473 --> 00:59:33,637
However, counsel will question you
about your own activities also.

903
00:59:33,978 --> 00:59:37,062
- Mr. Chairman!
- We will not hear from counsel.

904
00:59:37,648 --> 00:59:39,640
You have been told what the rule is.

905
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:42,978
If you have anything to say,
say it through your client.

906
00:59:46,657 --> 00:59:50,405
Chairman. Did you begin work
at the General Accounting Office in...

907
00:59:51,286 --> 00:59:53,492
...1945?
- Yes, sir.

908
00:59:54,372 --> 00:59:58,619
And, prior to that time,
had you been a cafeteria worker?

909
00:59:58,710 --> 01:00:00,038
Yes, I had.

910
01:00:00,337 --> 01:00:04,666
I see. While in the Pentagon,
since 1950...

911
01:00:05,008 --> 01:00:07,759
...have you had any connections
with coded messages?

912
01:00:07,844 --> 01:00:09,801
Have you ever handled
coded messages?

913
01:00:10,889 --> 01:00:13,426
- No more than to transmit 'em.
- Pardon me?

914
01:00:13,725 --> 01:00:15,931
No more than to transmit
the message.

915
01:00:16,019 --> 01:00:18,391
Than to transmit them?
Did you transmit codes?

916
01:00:18,479 --> 01:00:21,184
To receive or transmit messages
was all I had to do.

917
01:00:21,274 --> 01:00:23,895
And I've never been
into a courtroom in my life.

918
01:00:24,443 --> 01:00:25,724
Do you know the...

919
01:00:27,738 --> 01:00:29,398
...type of classification...

920
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:33,653
- Do you know if they were secret,
top secret, confidential? - No, sir.

921
01:00:33,911 --> 01:00:37,280
- You wouldn't know the degree
of classification? - No, sir.

922
01:00:37,706 --> 01:00:38,738
I see.

923
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,120
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to excuse myself, I've got...

924
01:00:44,296 --> 01:00:48,341
...a rather important appointment
to work on right now...

925
01:00:48,425 --> 01:00:52,672
...and I wonder if, Senator Mundt,
you would takeover as Chairman?

926
01:00:57,643 --> 01:00:59,185
- Chairman. Uh...
- Cohn.

927
01:00:59,269 --> 01:01:02,305
I have no further questions
of this witness at this time.

928
01:01:02,397 --> 01:01:06,525
We have the testimony of Mrs. Markward,
the undercover agent for the FBI...

929
01:01:06,818 --> 01:01:10,353
...stating that Annie Lee Moss
was a member, a dues-paying member...

930
01:01:10,447 --> 01:01:12,190
...of the Communist Party...

931
01:01:12,657 --> 01:01:14,946
...the Northeast Club
of the Communist Party.

932
01:01:15,034 --> 01:01:18,368
We have corroboration
of that testimony by another...

933
01:01:19,372 --> 01:01:21,614
...witness who was called
before the Committee...

934
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:23,534
...and gave a sworn statement
to the effect...

935
01:01:23,626 --> 01:01:26,295
...that she also knew Mrs. Moss
as a member...

936
01:01:26,379 --> 01:01:28,418
...of the Northeast Club
of the Communist Party.

937
01:01:28,506 --> 01:01:32,753
She's already lost her job. She's been
suspended because of this action.

938
01:01:33,511 --> 01:01:37,046
I'm not defending her. If she's
a Communist, I want her exposed.

939
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:41,055
But to make these statements
as we've got corroborating evidence...

940
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:44,685
...that she is a Communist,
under these circumstances...

941
01:01:44,772 --> 01:01:48,390
...I think she's entitled to have it
produced here in her presence...

942
01:01:48,567 --> 01:01:51,853
...and let the public know about it
and let her know about it.

943
01:01:55,282 --> 01:01:58,568
I don't like to try people
by hearsay evidence.

944
01:01:59,953 --> 01:02:02,705
I'd like to get the witnesses here
and try them...

945
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:06,124
...by testimony, under oath.

946
01:02:06,418 --> 01:02:10,001
The Chair will rule
that the comment of Mr. Cohn...

947
01:02:10,088 --> 01:02:11,713
...be stricken from the record.

948
01:02:11,965 --> 01:02:14,503
I didnt ask that, Mr. Chairman!

949
01:02:14,593 --> 01:02:17,214
...whether we should try to produce
a witness in public...

950
01:02:17,304 --> 01:02:20,507
...because the FBI may have
her undercover and we don't want to...

951
01:02:20,598 --> 01:02:25,141
You can't strike these statements
made by counsel here as to evidence...

952
01:02:25,228 --> 01:02:29,439
...that we're having and withholding.
You cannot strike that from the press...

953
01:02:29,524 --> 01:02:34,649
...nor from the public mind
once it's planted there. That's the...

954
01:02:36,572 --> 01:02:37,901
...evil of it!

955
01:02:38,199 --> 01:02:41,402
- Well, I'd look at it...
- I don't think it's fair to a witness...

956
01:02:41,494 --> 01:02:42,952
...to a citizen of this country...

957
01:02:43,037 --> 01:02:45,113
...to bring them up here
and cross-examine them...

958
01:02:45,206 --> 01:02:46,616
...then when they get through, say...

959
01:02:46,707 --> 01:02:49,661
..."The FBI has got something on you
that condemns you."

960
01:02:49,752 --> 01:02:52,457
- The Chair agrees...
- It is not sworn testimony...

961
01:02:52,546 --> 01:02:56,164
...it's convicting people
by rumor and hearsay and innuendo.

962
01:02:57,843 --> 01:03:01,461
You will notice that neither Senator
McClellan or Senator Symington...

963
01:03:01,555 --> 01:03:05,884
...nor this reporter know or claim
that Mrs. Moss was or is a Communist.

964
01:03:06,518 --> 01:03:10,981
They simply claimed that she had the
right to meet her accusers face to face.

965
01:03:25,912 --> 01:03:29,992
One month ago tonight we presented
a report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.

966
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:32,208
We labeled it as controversial.

967
01:03:32,752 --> 01:03:36,417
Most of that report consisted
of words and pictures of the Senator.

968
01:03:37,006 --> 01:03:38,548
At that time, we said...

969
01:03:38,716 --> 01:03:42,630
..."If theSenator believes we havedone
violence to his words or pictures..."

970
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:45,294
"...if he desires to speak,
to answer himself..."

971
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:48,509
"...an opportunity would be
afforded him on this program."

972
01:03:48,809 --> 01:03:52,510
The Senator sought the opportunity
after 3 weeks...

973
01:03:52,605 --> 01:03:56,685
...because he was very busy and wished
adequate time to prepare his reply.

974
01:03:57,234 --> 01:03:58,266
We agreed.

975
01:03:58,777 --> 01:04:02,941
We placed no restrictions on the manner
of the presentation of his reply...

976
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:06,158
...and we suggested that we would not
take time to comment...

977
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:07,986
...on this particular program.

978
01:04:08,537 --> 01:04:12,487
Here now is Senator Joseph R. McCarthy,
junior Senator from Wisconsin.

979
01:04:13,917 --> 01:04:20,252
Good evening. Mr. Edward R. Murrow,
Educational Director of the CBS...

980
01:04:21,258 --> 01:04:23,583
...devoted his program
to an attack...

981
01:04:23,677 --> 01:04:26,880
...on the work ofthe US Senate
Investigating Committee...

982
01:04:27,305 --> 01:04:29,512
...and on me personally
as its Chairman.

983
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:33,968
Now, over the past 4 years,
he has made repeated attacks upon me...

984
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:36,229
...and those fighting Communists.

985
01:04:37,649 --> 01:04:40,852
Of course, neither Joe McCarthy
nor Edward R. Murrow...

986
01:04:41,528 --> 01:04:44,445
...is of any great importance
as individuals.

987
01:04:45,531 --> 01:04:47,026
We are only important...

988
01:04:47,367 --> 01:04:51,411
...in our relation to the great struggle
to preserve our American liberties.

989
01:04:51,871 --> 01:04:56,580
Now ordinarily, I wouldnt take time
out from the important work at hand...

990
01:04:57,335 --> 01:04:58,580
...to answer Murrow.

991
01:04:59,086 --> 01:05:00,628
However, in this case...

992
01:05:00,713 --> 01:05:04,497
...I feel justified in doing so
because Murrow is the symbol...

993
01:05:05,259 --> 01:05:06,338
...the leader...

994
01:05:06,635 --> 01:05:11,760
...and the cleverest of the jackal pack
which is always found at the throat...

995
01:05:12,182 --> 01:05:16,227
...of anyone who dares to expose
individual Communists and traitors.

996
01:05:17,396 --> 01:05:19,353
And I am compelled by the fact...

997
01:05:19,773 --> 01:05:22,264
...to say to you
that Mr. Edward R. Murrow...

998
01:05:22,859 --> 01:05:25,397
...as far back as 20 years ago...

999
01:05:26,071 --> 01:05:29,487
...was engaged in propaganda
for Communist causes.

1000
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,737
For example, the Institute
of International Education...

1001
01:05:33,954 --> 01:05:36,195
...of which he was
the Acting Director...

1002
01:05:36,790 --> 01:05:39,744
...was chosen to act
as a representative...

1003
01:05:40,126 --> 01:05:41,786
...by a Soviet agency...

1004
01:05:42,921 --> 01:05:48,342
...to do a job which would normally
be done by the Russian secret police.

1005
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:52,925
Mr. Murrow, by his own admission,
was a member of the IWW...

1006
01:05:53,014 --> 01:05:55,552
...that's the Industrial Workers
of the World...

1007
01:05:55,641 --> 01:05:58,429
...a terrorist organization
cited as subversive...

1008
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,511
...by an Attorney General
of the United States.

1009
01:06:01,689 --> 01:06:05,022
Mr. Murrow said on this program
and I quote...

1010
01:06:05,818 --> 01:06:09,519
..."The actions of the junior
Senator from Wisconsin..."

1011
01:06:10,865 --> 01:06:14,909
"...have given considerable comfort
to the enemy."

1012
01:06:15,536 --> 01:06:19,450
That is the language of our statute
of treason, rather strong language.

1013
01:06:20,207 --> 01:06:25,546
If I am giving comfort to our enemies,
I ought not to be in the Senate.

1014
01:06:25,879 --> 01:06:27,788
If, on the other hand,
Mr. Murrow...

1015
01:06:28,257 --> 01:06:30,333
...is giving comfort to our enemies...

1016
01:06:30,592 --> 01:06:33,048
...he ought not to be brought
into the homes...

1017
01:06:33,261 --> 01:06:36,844
...of millions of Americans
by the CBS.

1018
01:06:36,973 --> 01:06:38,432
And I want to assure you...

1019
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:42,560
...that I will not be deterred...

1020
01:06:43,313 --> 01:06:49,149
...by the attacks of the Murrows,
the Lattimores, the Fosters...

1021
01:06:49,944 --> 01:06:53,894
...The Daily Worker
or the Communist Party itself.

1022
01:06:56,075 --> 01:06:59,195
And I make no claim to leadership.

1023
01:07:01,497 --> 01:07:03,075
Incomplete humility...

1024
01:07:04,917 --> 01:07:09,045
...I do ask you and every American
who loves this country...

1025
01:07:09,755 --> 01:07:11,380
...to join with me.

1026
01:07:39,451 --> 01:07:41,527
[Everyone talks about the weather.]

1027
01:07:42,371 --> 01:07:45,206
[Wherever you look
on America's modern farms...]

1028
01:07:45,499 --> 01:07:49,959
[... aluminum is on the job, helping the
farmer do something about the weather.]

1029
01:07:50,837 --> 01:07:54,087
[Aluminum for the farm
is one more example of how Alcoa...]

1030
01:07:54,174 --> 01:07:55,549
[... since 1999...]

1031
01:07:55,884 --> 01:07:59,716
[... has continued to pioneer
new uses for this vital metal.]

1032
01:08:00,305 --> 01:08:04,433
[New uses of aluminum that mean
better farms and better farming.]

1033
01:08:05,059 --> 01:08:08,724
The aluminum from the nation's
first and leading producer...]

1034
01:08:09,313 --> 01:08:12,765
[... Alcoa,
Aluminum Company of America.]

1035
01:08:13,276 --> 01:08:15,767
Last week, Senator McCarthy
appeared on this program...

1036
01:08:15,862 --> 01:08:18,353
...to correct any errors
he might have thought we made...

1037
01:08:18,447 --> 01:08:20,025
...in our report of March 9th.

1038
01:08:20,116 --> 01:08:23,532
Since he made no reference to any
statements of fact that we made...

1039
01:08:23,619 --> 01:08:26,371
...we must conclude
that he found no errors of fact.

1040
01:08:27,289 --> 01:08:29,780
He proved again
that anyone who exposes him...

1041
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:34,502
...anyone who doesn't share his disregard
for decency and human dignity...

1042
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:37,121
...and the rights
guaranteed by the Constitution...

1043
01:08:37,216 --> 01:08:39,920
...must be either a Communist
or a fellow traveler.

1044
01:08:40,511 --> 01:08:42,302
I fully expected this treatment.

1045
01:08:43,096 --> 01:08:46,548
The Senator added this reporter's name
to a long list of individuals...

1046
01:08:46,642 --> 01:08:50,141
...and institutions he has accused
of serving the Communist cause.

1047
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:52,264
His proposition is very simple:

1048
01:08:52,606 --> 01:08:56,105
...anyone who criticizes or opposes
Senator McCarthy's methods...

1049
01:08:56,318 --> 01:08:57,728
...must be a Communist.

1050
01:08:58,445 --> 01:09:02,193
And if that be true, there are
an awful lot of Communists in the USA.

1051
01:09:02,866 --> 01:09:06,484
For the record, let's consider briefly
some of the Senator's charges.

1052
01:09:06,578 --> 01:09:08,654
He claimed, but offered no proof...

1053
01:09:08,746 --> 01:09:12,080
...that I had been a member of the
Industrial Workers of the World.

1054
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:13,329
That is false.

1055
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:17,708
I was never a member ofthe IWW,
never applied for membership.

1056
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,413
The Senator charged
that Professor Harold Laski...

1057
01:09:21,509 --> 01:09:24,545
...a British scholar and politician,
dedicated a book to me.

1058
01:09:24,637 --> 01:09:25,716
That's true.

1059
01:09:26,013 --> 01:09:29,465
He is dead.
He was a socialist, I am not.

1060
01:09:30,518 --> 01:09:32,226
He was a civilized individual...

1061
01:09:32,311 --> 01:09:35,561
...who did not insist upon agreement
with his political principles...

1062
01:09:35,648 --> 01:09:38,483
...as a pre-condition
for conversation or friendship.

1063
01:09:38,901 --> 01:09:41,143
I do not agree
with his political ideas.

1064
01:09:42,071 --> 01:09:44,562
I ask, as he makes clear
in the introduction...

1065
01:09:44,656 --> 01:09:48,108
...dedicated the book to me,
not because of political agreement...

1066
01:09:48,202 --> 01:09:52,033
...but because he held my wartime
broadcast from London in high regard.

1067
01:09:52,539 --> 01:09:54,247
And the dedication so reads.

1068
01:09:55,834 --> 01:09:58,290
I believed 20 years ago
and I believe today...

1069
01:09:58,754 --> 01:10:02,372
...that mature Americans can engage
in conversation and controversy...

1070
01:10:02,465 --> 01:10:05,716
...the clash of ideas, with Communists
anywhere in the world...

1071
01:10:05,802 --> 01:10:08,340
...without becoming
contaminated or converted.

1072
01:10:09,139 --> 01:10:11,712
I believe that our faith,
our conviction...

1073
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:14,591
...our determination
are stronger than theirs...

1074
01:10:14,894 --> 01:10:19,307
...and that we can successfully compete,
not only in the area of bombs...

1075
01:10:19,774 --> 01:10:21,601
...but in the area of ideas.

1076
01:10:23,861 --> 01:10:26,531
I have worked with CBS
for more than 19 years.

1077
01:10:26,906 --> 01:10:30,654
The company has subscribed fully
to my integrity and responsibility...

1078
01:10:30,743 --> 01:10:33,151
...as a broadcaster
and as a loyal American.

1079
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:37,448
I require no lectures from the junior
Senator from Wisconsin...

1080
01:10:37,541 --> 01:10:40,163
...as to the dangers
or terrors of Communism.

1081
01:10:41,295 --> 01:10:43,667
Having searched my conscience
and my files...

1082
01:10:43,756 --> 01:10:46,792
...I cannot contend that
I have always been right or wise...

1083
01:10:46,884 --> 01:10:50,004
...but I have attempted to pursue
thet ruth with diligence...

1084
01:10:50,095 --> 01:10:51,210
...and to report it...

1085
01:10:51,305 --> 01:10:54,389
...even though, as in this case,
I had been warned in advance...

1086
01:10:54,475 --> 01:10:58,009
...that I would be subjected
to the attentions of Senator McCarthy.

1087
01:10:58,979 --> 01:11:03,107
We shall hope to deal with matters
of more vital interest next week.

1088
01:11:03,942 --> 01:11:05,602
Good night, and good luck.

1089
01:11:13,326 --> 01:11:17,110
In the last analysis, the Senator was
perched on the television high dive...

1090
01:11:17,205 --> 01:11:19,494
...and all prepared
to make a resounding splash.

1091
01:11:19,582 --> 01:11:22,287
He jumped beautifully,
but he neglected to check first...

1092
01:11:22,377 --> 01:11:25,164
...where he was going to land.
It must have been a shock...

1093
01:11:25,255 --> 01:11:28,754
...to discover that Mr. Murrow
had drained the water out of the pool.

1094
01:11:29,634 --> 01:11:32,207
- Is that the Times? Gould?
- Yeah, it's Jack Gould.

1095
01:11:32,303 --> 01:11:34,379
- He's a hell of a writer.
- Yes, he is.

1096
01:11:35,014 --> 01:11:37,683
- If we can afford him!
- Stanton's got a public opinion...

1097
01:11:37,767 --> 01:11:39,344
Senate's investigating McCarthy.

1098
01:11:40,436 --> 01:11:41,467
What?

1099
01:11:41,604 --> 01:11:45,222
The Army's charging that McCarthy
and Cohn exercised undue pressure...

1100
01:11:45,316 --> 01:11:48,685
...to get preferential treatment
for Schine. - Who's the source?

1101
01:11:48,778 --> 01:11:52,822
- Got a second source? - There isn't,
but this is coming out in 2 hours.

1102
01:11:52,907 --> 01:11:56,240
- Who's heading up the investigation?
- It's not gonna be McCarthy!

1103
01:11:56,327 --> 01:11:58,118
- Really?
- What happened?

1104
01:11:58,287 --> 01:12:01,157
- Also get me the Washington Post!
- What's going on?

1105
01:12:01,248 --> 01:12:02,742
It's Williams
for Jack Thompson.

1106
01:12:02,833 --> 01:12:04,624
The Senate's investigating McCarthy.

1107
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:07,583
There is an added bit of comedy
to this whole story.

1108
01:12:07,671 --> 01:12:09,664
The Committee cannot convene
for several days...

1109
01:12:09,756 --> 01:12:12,508
...because Senator McCarthy
has a slight case of laryngitis.

1110
01:12:12,592 --> 01:12:16,460
And he must recover
over the desert air of Arizona.

1111
01:12:19,766 --> 01:12:23,301
- But Stevens is going after him
and it looks like Joe Welch. - Yeah.

1112
01:12:23,395 --> 01:12:25,802
They're gonna allow each side
to call witnesses...

1113
01:12:25,897 --> 01:12:27,724
...and be privy to other testimony.

1114
01:12:28,024 --> 01:12:31,891
- Fred, we still have a meeting!
- We're gonna go to talk toThompson.

1115
01:12:34,447 --> 01:12:35,941
No, thanks, Jack. Bye.

1116
01:12:36,824 --> 01:12:39,778
Freddy, we're a hit.
Right up there with "Howdy Dowdy"!

1117
01:12:41,079 --> 01:12:43,071
Can I have
an outlet satellite, please?

1118
01:12:44,916 --> 01:12:51,535
- 74, 76,47. Thank you.
- Murrayville3, 1-2-7-6.

1119
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:14,686
The fact of newscaster
Don Hollenbeck's suicide yesterday...

1120
01:13:14,778 --> 01:13:18,728
...does not remove from the record
that peculiar history...

1121
01:13:19,449 --> 01:13:24,491
...of the leftist slanting of news
indulged consistently by the CBS.

1122
01:13:25,872 --> 01:13:29,122
Hollenbeck was what most astute
students of CBS's strange...

1123
01:13:29,459 --> 01:13:31,784
...and questionable new methods
considered...

1124
01:13:31,878 --> 01:13:37,465
..."typical of its newscasters".
By Jack O'Brian.

1125
01:15:11,684 --> 01:15:13,723
Oh, yeah. I like it like that.

1126
01:15:15,980 --> 01:15:19,894
One of the best programs I ever heard
was called "CBS Views The Press".

1127
01:15:20,609 --> 01:15:23,065
A great many people liked it,
some didn't...

1128
01:15:23,445 --> 01:15:26,067
...but noone ever called it
anything but honest.

1129
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:30,274
It was the work of an honest reporter.
Don Hollenbeck.

1130
01:15:31,244 --> 01:15:33,617
He also worked occasionally
on "See It Now'.

1131
01:15:34,331 --> 01:15:37,166
He did the 11 p.m. News
over some of these stations.

1132
01:15:37,876 --> 01:15:40,581
He had been sick lately
and he died this morning.

1133
01:15:41,171 --> 01:15:43,744
The police said
it was suicide... gas.

1134
01:15:45,467 --> 01:15:46,747
Not much of an obit.

1135
01:15:47,218 --> 01:15:50,385
But, at least we got our facts
straight, and it was brief.

1136
01:15:51,431 --> 01:15:53,969
And that's all Don Hollenbeck
would have asked.

1137
01:15:54,934 --> 01:15:56,726
Good night, and good luck.

1138
01:16:02,358 --> 01:16:04,481
Got to be in Philadelphia
this morning.

1139
01:16:05,570 --> 01:16:07,064
What time is your train?

1140
01:16:08,155 --> 01:16:09,151
9:00.

1141
01:16:10,741 --> 01:16:13,315
- Charlie going with you?
- Uh-huh.

1142
01:16:22,336 --> 01:16:23,534
Here's a thought.

1143
01:16:25,381 --> 01:16:26,756
What if we're wrong?

1144
01:16:29,426 --> 01:16:30,671
We're not wrong.

1145
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:34,095
We're not going to look back...

1146
01:16:36,141 --> 01:16:38,264
...and say we protected
the wrong side?

1147
01:16:40,687 --> 01:16:46,026
Protected them from what? In the name
of what? What would we be preserving?

1148
01:16:47,152 --> 01:16:50,568
Argument could bemade,
'for the greater good".

1149
01:16:52,824 --> 01:16:55,529
Not once you give it all away.
It's no good then.

1150
01:16:57,245 --> 01:16:58,620
It's just a thought.

1151
01:17:05,336 --> 01:17:10,081
Senator, may we not drop this? We know
he belonged to the Lawyer's Guild.

1152
01:17:10,174 --> 01:17:12,748
And Mr. Cohn nods his head at me.

1153
01:17:12,969 --> 01:17:16,801
- I did you, I think, no personal
injury, Mr. Cohn. - No, sir.

1154
01:17:16,889 --> 01:17:19,510
- I meant to do you
no personal injury. - No.

1155
01:17:19,684 --> 01:17:22,768
And if I did, I beg your pardon.

1156
01:17:23,187 --> 01:17:28,643
Let us not assassinate this lad
further, Senator. You've done enough.

1157
01:17:28,984 --> 01:17:32,519
- Let's... let's...
- Have you no sense of decency, sir?

1158
01:17:32,738 --> 01:17:37,863
At long last, have you left
no sense of decency?

1159
01:17:38,243 --> 01:17:42,241
- I know this hurts you, Mr. Welch.
- Senator, I think it hurts you, too.

1160
01:17:42,372 --> 01:17:45,872
- I'd like to finish this.
- Have you some private reservation...

1161
01:17:45,959 --> 01:17:49,743
...when you take the oath
that you will tell the whole truth...

1162
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:53,297
...that lets you be the judge
of what you will testify to?

1163
01:17:53,467 --> 01:17:57,085
The answer is there's no reservation
about telling the whole truth.

1164
01:17:57,262 --> 01:18:02,600
Thank you, sir. Then tell us
who delivered the documents to you!

1165
01:18:02,684 --> 01:18:05,720
I don't want to mean that
this new fashion is not chic.

1166
01:18:05,812 --> 01:18:09,560
- I think it's just no good for me.
- Uh, not for you.

1167
01:18:09,857 --> 01:18:12,562
Milko, anything you care to say
on that subject?

1168
01:18:12,652 --> 01:18:14,027
I think no comment.

1169
01:18:17,657 --> 01:18:21,026
It's got to be there. If you can't
find it, I cant write about it.

1170
01:18:21,118 --> 01:18:23,526
- Check again.
- Charlie said he dropped it off.

1171
01:18:23,621 --> 01:18:26,788
- Charlie said he dropped...
- Shirley, can I see you a minute?

1172
01:18:26,999 --> 01:18:28,624
- I got to call you back.
- Joe!

1173
01:18:28,751 --> 01:18:29,747
You, too.

1174
01:18:40,054 --> 01:18:41,133
Close the door.

1175
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:45,470
Have a seat.

1176
01:18:49,104 --> 01:18:52,224
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you. - Swell. Yeah.

1177
01:18:52,899 --> 01:18:55,984
Uh, you both are aware
that there's a policy at CBS...

1178
01:18:56,069 --> 01:18:58,192
...that no two employees
can be married.

1179
01:19:00,991 --> 01:19:04,407
I want to ask you a question,
but I don't want you to answer it.

1180
01:19:04,494 --> 01:19:06,237
I want you to consider it.

1181
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:09,074
I know you two are married.

1182
01:19:11,167 --> 01:19:12,282
Everyone knows.

1183
01:19:13,461 --> 01:19:14,742
That's not my question.

1184
01:19:15,129 --> 01:19:18,214
In the next few weeks
I have to lay off a couple of people.

1185
01:19:18,299 --> 01:19:21,134
We're making some significant cuts
across the board.

1186
01:19:22,428 --> 01:19:24,053
I wanted you to know that...

1187
01:19:24,263 --> 01:19:27,217
...because you could save
someone else being fired.

1188
01:19:29,393 --> 01:19:33,261
I'm asking you to consider
makng this decision a little easier.

1189
01:19:35,608 --> 01:19:37,268
I don't need an answer now.

1190
01:19:38,819 --> 01:19:40,859
Just think about it.

1191
01:19:42,531 --> 01:19:43,527
Good.

1192
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:56,705
- Well, Joe...
- Well?

1193
01:19:57,129 --> 01:20:00,332
- Sure we'regonna miss you
around here. - I'll pack my things.

1194
01:20:03,593 --> 01:20:06,298
- I think it's for the best.
- We'll find out!

1195
01:20:08,932 --> 01:20:10,212
Mrs. Wershba...

1196
01:20:13,103 --> 01:20:14,265
Everybody knew.

1197
01:20:23,321 --> 01:20:25,278
Natalie, did he say
what it was about?

1198
01:20:25,365 --> 01:20:28,235
No. Just that he wanted to talk
to you in his office.

1199
01:20:43,966 --> 01:20:45,081
Uh-oh!

1200
01:20:48,512 --> 01:20:51,963
The problem isn't simply
that you've lost your sponsor.

1201
01:20:52,349 --> 01:20:54,674
With Alcoa, "See It Now"
still loses money.

1202
01:20:54,768 --> 01:20:56,144
The fee is 50,000 dollars.

1203
01:20:56,228 --> 01:20:58,801
Last week's episode we did
for less than 50,000 dollars.

1204
01:20:58,897 --> 01:21:00,806
Fred, you're speakng
beyond your competence.

1205
01:21:00,899 --> 01:21:03,307
We'll certainly find another sponsor.

1206
01:21:03,402 --> 01:21:07,102
"64,000 Dollar Question" brings in
over 90,000 in sponsors...

1207
01:21:07,197 --> 01:21:09,403
...and it costs one-third
of what youdo.

1208
01:21:09,491 --> 01:21:12,492
Ed, I've got Tuesday night
programming that's number one.

1209
01:21:12,577 --> 01:21:16,029
People want to enjoy themselves.
They don't want a civics lesson.

1210
01:21:16,122 --> 01:21:19,040
- What do you want, Bill?
- I don't want to get a stomachache...

1211
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:21,616
...every time you take on
a controversial subject.

1212
01:21:23,338 --> 01:21:26,422
I'm afraid that's the price
you have to be willing to pay.

1213
01:21:27,842 --> 01:21:30,796
Let's walk very carefully
through these next few moments.

1214
01:21:30,887 --> 01:21:33,294
The content of what we're doing
is more important...

1215
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:36,758
...than what some guy in Cincinnati...
- It's what you'redoing, Ed. Not me.

1216
01:21:36,851 --> 01:21:37,966
Not Frank Stanton. You.

1217
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:42,350
"CBS News", "See It Now"
all belong to you, Bill.

1218
01:21:42,440 --> 01:21:43,554
You wouldn't know it.

1219
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:50,110
- What is it you want? Credit?
- I never censored a single program.

1220
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:55,486
I hold on to affiliates
who wanted entertainment from us.

1221
01:21:55,870 --> 01:21:57,661
I fight to keep the license...

1222
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:01,115
...with the very same politicians
that you are bringing down...

1223
01:22:01,208 --> 01:22:06,249
...and I never,
never said no to you. Never.

1224
01:22:07,631 --> 01:22:10,751
I would argue that we have done
very well by one another.

1225
01:22:11,885 --> 01:22:13,794
I would argue that this network...

1226
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:18,091
...is defined by what the news
department has accomplished.

1227
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:22,228
And I would also argue that never saying
no is not the same as not censoring.

1228
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:25,479
Really? You should teach journalism.
You and Mr. Friendly.

1229
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:33,191
Let me ask you this:

1230
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:36,699
...why didn't you correct McCarthy...

1231
01:22:36,784 --> 01:22:39,821
...when he said that Alger Hiss
was convicted of treason?

1232
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:43,703
He was only convicted of perjury.
You corrected everything else.

1233
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:47,578
Did you not want the appearance
of defending a known Communist?

1234
01:22:47,670 --> 01:22:50,505
I would argue that everyone censors,
including you.

1235
01:22:54,510 --> 01:22:56,218
What do you want to do, Bill?

1236
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:03,178
I'm takng your program
from a half an hour to an hour.

1237
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:06,768
And it wont be a weekly program
and it won't be Tuesday nights.

1238
01:23:07,398 --> 01:23:09,770
- When would it be?
- Sunday afternoons.

1239
01:23:13,278 --> 01:23:15,567
- How many episodes?
- 5.

1240
01:23:18,325 --> 01:23:20,234
Why don't you just fire me, Bill?

1241
01:23:20,369 --> 01:23:22,741
I don't think
it's what either of us wants.

1242
01:23:27,209 --> 01:23:28,584
You owe me 5 shows.

1243
01:23:38,595 --> 01:23:41,216
- You won't like the subject matter.
- Probably not.

1244
01:23:41,389 --> 01:23:43,547
Fred, I'll need you for a moment.

1245
01:23:58,281 --> 01:24:00,606
- Thank you, Mary.
- Goodbye, Mr. Friendly.

1246
01:24:06,831 --> 01:24:10,164
- He wants me to lay a few people off.
- I'm sure he does.

1247
01:24:10,334 --> 01:24:13,370
Let's do our first show
about the downfall of television.

1248
01:24:16,507 --> 01:24:19,923
- Senate's gonna vote to censure
McCarthy tomorrow. - Probably.

1249
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:23,213
- And then what happens?
- He sits in the back row. - Right.

1250
01:24:23,555 --> 01:24:27,767
- They keep him in the Senate.
They don't kick him out. - No, he stays.

1251
01:24:38,403 --> 01:24:40,609
Well, we might as well
go down swinging.

1252
01:24:44,617 --> 01:24:47,535
Did you know the most trusted man
in America is Milton Berle?

1253
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:49,578
See, you should have worn a dress!

1254
01:24:51,291 --> 01:24:53,912
- Howd does a Scotch sound?
- Scotch sounds good.

1255
01:24:54,961 --> 01:24:57,499
- Did you know Joe and Shirley
were married? - Sure.

1256
01:24:57,588 --> 01:24:59,628
- Did everyone know?
- Pretty much.

1257
01:24:59,716 --> 01:25:02,503
We are proud because
from the beginning of this nation...

1258
01:25:02,969 --> 01:25:04,427
...man can walk upright.

1259
01:25:07,139 --> 01:25:09,381
No matter who he is
or who she is.

1260
01:25:10,267 --> 01:25:14,217
He can walk upright
and meet his friend or his enemy.

1261
01:25:15,106 --> 01:25:18,142
And he does not fear
that because that enemy...

1262
01:25:19,109 --> 01:25:21,268
...may be in a position
of great power...

1263
01:25:22,237 --> 01:25:27,030
...that he can be suddenly
thrown in jail...

1264
01:25:28,577 --> 01:25:32,076
...to rott here without charges
and with no recourse to justice.

1265
01:25:34,124 --> 01:25:37,208
We have the Habeas Corpus Act
and we respect it.

1266
01:25:38,045 --> 01:25:41,248
I began by saying that our history
will be what we makeit.

1267
01:25:42,007 --> 01:25:43,549
If we go on as we are...

1268
01:25:43,842 --> 01:25:47,425
...then history will take its revenge,
and retribution will not limp...

1269
01:25:47,512 --> 01:25:48,923
...in catching up with us.

1270
01:25:50,432 --> 01:25:54,429
Just once in a while, let us exalt the
importance of ideas and information.

1271
01:25:55,812 --> 01:25:59,263
Let us dream to the extent of saying
that on a given Sunday night...

1272
01:25:59,357 --> 01:26:01,599
...the time normally
occupied by Ed Sullivan...

1273
01:26:01,693 --> 01:26:05,477
...is given over to a clinical survey
on the state of American education.

1274
01:26:05,571 --> 01:26:08,987
And a week or two later, the time
normally used by Steve Allen...

1275
01:26:09,075 --> 01:26:13,369
...is devoted to a thorough-going study
of American policy in the Middle East.

1276
01:26:14,330 --> 01:26:17,865
Would the corporate image of their
respective sponsors be damaged?

1277
01:26:18,167 --> 01:26:21,370
Would the shareholders rise up
in their wrath and complain?

1278
01:26:22,171 --> 01:26:23,167
Would anything happen...

1279
01:26:23,255 --> 01:26:27,039
...other than a few million people would
have received a little illumination...

1280
01:26:27,134 --> 01:26:30,384
...on subjects that may well determine
the future of this country...

1281
01:26:30,471 --> 01:26:32,962
...and therefore the future
of the corporations?

1282
01:26:33,724 --> 01:26:37,140
To those who say, "People wouldn't
look, they wouldn't be interested..."

1283
01:26:37,227 --> 01:26:40,228
"...they're tooc omplacent,
indifferent and insulated"...

1284
01:26:40,439 --> 01:26:44,306
...I can only reply: There is,
in one reporter's opinion...

1285
01:26:44,776 --> 01:26:47,398
...considerable evidence
against that contention.

1286
01:26:48,447 --> 01:26:51,447
But even if they are right,
what have they got to lose?

1287
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:53,277
Because if they are right...

1288
01:26:53,368 --> 01:26:55,408
...and this instrument
is good for nothing...

1289
01:26:55,495 --> 01:26:58,033
...but to entertain,
amuse and insulate...

1290
01:26:58,748 --> 01:27:00,622
...then the tube is flickering now...

1291
01:27:00,709 --> 01:27:03,793
...and we will soon see
that the whole struggle is lost.

1292
01:27:04,754 --> 01:27:06,296
This instrument can teach.

1293
01:27:06,714 --> 01:27:09,205
It can illuminate
and it can even inspire.

1294
01:27:09,884 --> 01:27:13,964
But it can do so only to the extent
that humans are determined to use it...

1295
01:27:14,055 --> 01:27:15,466
...towards those ends.

1296
01:27:16,891 --> 01:27:19,464
Otherwise,
it is merely wiresand lights...

1297
01:27:20,186 --> 01:27:21,348
...in a box.

1298
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:26,896
Good night, and good luck.
