1
00:02:21,517 --> 00:02:23,476
Ηi, Τoivo.

2
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,440
Ηey. Your pal just drove into town,
Mr. McCarthy.

3
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:35,321
l'll have one more, Τoivo.

4
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,157
l'm afraid l'll have to pay
my bar bill tomorrow.

5
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:40,284
You're good with me, Mr. McCarthy.

6
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,328
Thank you, Toivo.

7
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,670
- Good night, Toivo.
- Good night, Mr. McCarthy.

8
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,629
Operator.

9
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:02,301
Operator, l want, uh, 489, Thunder Bay.

10
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,428
l want to speak to Mrs. Manion.

11
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,014
M-A-N-l-O-N.

12
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:11,018
This is Paul Biegler speaking.
lron City, 700.

13
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:26,242
- Well, do they know when she'll be there?
- No, they don't.

14
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,121
l see. Well, just leave a message,
and tell her to call this number.

15
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:32,164
Thank you.

16
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,293
All right. What do you say there, counselor?

17
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,337
Save your money.

18
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,591
What's in the brown paper bag?

19
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,886
lt might be a cabbage head.

20
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,888
But it wouldn't be.

21
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,683
You're a very suspicious man.

22
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:56,939
True. l'm everlastingly suspicious of...

23
00:05:57,024 --> 00:06:00,443
and/or fascinated by...

24
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,446
the contents of brown paper bags.

25
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,033
- Shall l sneak a peek?
- You do that, counselor.

26
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,662
You do that, and...

27
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:15,458
after you sneak a peek, why, you uncork...

28
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,585
whatever you find.

29
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,009
- Shall l pour?
- Your privilege.

30
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,053
My pleasure, sir.

31
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,774
You fought this soldier by yourself.

32
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:42,902
You've been drinkin' alone, Polly.

33
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,904
l don't like that.

34
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,324
Ah, drop the stone, counselor.
You live in a glass house.

35
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:53,162
My windows have been busted
a long time ago, so l can say as l please.

36
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,291
Ηave an ltalian cigar?

37
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,876
No, thanks.

38
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,755
Those stinkweeds are another sign
of your decadence.

39
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,053
Polly, it's a fact.

40
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:12,598
Since Mitch Lodwick beat you
out of the office of public prosecutor...

41
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:15,184
you haven't been worth salt for peanuts.

42
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,937
Not that l don't understand how you feel.

43
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,942
When a man gets beat out of
an office he's held for a long time...

44
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:26,570
he feels his community has deserted him...

45
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,906
the finger of scorn is pointed at him.

46
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,284
None but the lonely heart
shall know my anguish.

47
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,995
Polly, you're a good lawyer.
You ought to make like one.

48
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,792
Be here, ready for clients, not out fishin'
and playin' that rooty-tooty jazz.

49
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,128
♪♪ Oh, l'm making a living.

50
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:47,133
l run a few abstracts and divorce Jane Doe
from John Doe every once in a while.

51
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:49,802
Threaten a few deadbeats.

52
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,555
And in the evening l sit around
and drink bourbon whiskey...

53
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,725
and read law with Parnell Emmett McCarthy...

54
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:59,186
one of the world's great men.

55
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,981
That was a kind word, Polly.

56
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,234
You know, l might have been.

57
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:10,239
That's one of the reasons l hate to see
your talent pushed aside by lesser men.

58
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,700
l look at you and l see myself years ago...

59
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:18,164
with the same love for the smell
of the old brown books and the dusty office.

60
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,169
Ηere's a rose, a lily...

61
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,172
a sweet lupine.

62
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:29,800
The United States Supreme Court Reports.

63
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:34,763
Well, what shall we read
this evening, counselor?

64
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:37,766
Ηow about a little, uh, Chief Justice Holmes?

65
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,648
Restrain Chief Justice Holmes for a minute.
l might have a client.

66
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,901
Been waiting for a call. Hello?

67
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:49,361
- Mr. Biegler?
- This is Paul Biegler speaking.

68
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,031
- Ηere's your party.
- Hello? Mrs. Manion?

69
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,033
- What?
- Mr. BiegIer?

70
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,744
l'm sorry l missed you a while ago.
Did you get my message?

71
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,121
- Who is that? What is that name?
- Just a minute, please.

72
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,957
We seem to have a bad connection.
Just hold on.

73
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:05,169
lt's a woman name of Manion.
Maida took a message from her.

74
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,171
- ln Thunder Bay?
- Uh-huh.

75
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,298
lf she wants you to represent
her husband, say yes.

76
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,468
- l don't know what it's all about.
- Pretend you do and say yes.

77
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,220
- Ηello?
- Mr. Biegler?

78
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:17,431
Oh, yes. lt's much better now.
Yes, l can hear you fine.

79
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,517
l've waited for your call all afternoon.

80
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:23,312
Yes, weII, I just got in a few moments ago.

81
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,814
You've read about my husband?
Muffy, please.

82
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,318
- Yes.
- Mr. BiegIer, have you read about my husband?

83
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,903
Muffy, pIease.

84
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,407
Well, yes, l have. A little.

85
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:39,745
- WiII you defend him?
- l don't know. l'd have to know more about it.

86
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,831
Will you talk to him?
Mr. Biegler, he's in the county jail.

87
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,293
Will you see him in the morning?
Ηe's-He's very anxious to see you.

88
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,880
- You've been so highly recommended.
- l have?

89
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:53,133
Yeah. Someone toId him about you.
WiIl you see him?

90
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,886
Well, l suppose l could.
l'll see him tomorrow morning.

91
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,181
Would you want me there too, Mr. Biegler?

92
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,851
l think that'd be fine.
Let's make it about 1 0:00, huh?

93
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:05,521
Thank you. Thank you so much.

94
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,606
Yes, you're quite welcome. Bye.

95
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:09,608
Now, what's this all about?

96
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,569
A man named Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion.

97
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,863
Ηer husband, he's a lieutenant in the army.

98
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,866
There's a temporary base in Thunder Bay.
Gunnery or something.

99
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:22,871
The lieutenant goes to Quill's
place and plugs Mr. Quill about five times...

100
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,374
which causes Mr. Quill
to promptly die of lead poisoning.

101
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,459
- When did all this happen?
- A couple of nights ago.

102
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:30,129
lf you hadn't been out fishing in a rowboat
in some godforsaken backwater...

103
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,464
you'd have known about it.

104
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,792
- Morning, Maida.
- Oh, there it is.

105
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,794
- What?
- The newspaper.

106
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:55,130
l thought maybe they didn't bring it.
We haven't paid the bill.

107
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:58,050
- Did you get my note?
- Uh-huh. We may be in the case.

108
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,303
l'm just reading up on it
now before talking to Lieutenant Manion.

109
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:04,515
- Doesn't he ever go home?
- You mean Parnell?

110
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:07,851
- We were up late last night.
- ls that a fact?

111
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:11,563
Yeah. l think maybe you'd better cancel
all my appointments for today.

112
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:15,901
What appointments?
People think you migrated into the woods.

113
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,321
lf this refrigerator gets
any more fish in it...

114
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:23,242
it'll swim upstream and spawn, all by itself.

115
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:27,413
May l have your attention for a moment, please?

116
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,834
- Yeah.
- l was going over your checkbook yesterday.

117
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,211
l can't pay me my salary.

118
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,672
What did you do with the fee
for the Walkers' divorce?

119
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,966
Ηelp salt a uranium mine or something?

120
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,846
- Uh, l bought a few bare necessities.
- Like a new outboard motor.

121
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,057
l wish l could be classed as a necessity.

122
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,059
- Aren't you gonna have your toast?
- No, no.

123
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:52,146
l'll, uh - l'll, uh...

124
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,398
call you and let you know how things are going.

125
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,733
Now don't let him pay you off in purple hearts.

126
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,570
Those professional soldiers never have a dime.

127
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,322
l ought to know. l was married to one.

128
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,137
l beg your pardon. Are you Mrs. Manion?

129
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,473
- Hi.
- l'm Paul Biegler.

130
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,475
- l'm Laura.
- How do you do?

131
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,438
- This is Muff.
- Hello, Muff. The jail's right here.

132
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,110
You're tall.

133
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,741
- Hello, Polly.
- Hi, Sulo.

134
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,743
You wait here, Muffy.

135
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,750
- Good to see you, Polly.
- How ya feelin'?

136
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,252
Fine. l guess you come for the soldier boy.

137
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:00,547
Yeah. Sulo, do you think it'd be all right
if we talked in the sheriff's office?

138
00:14:00,632 --> 00:14:02,758
Oh, sure, Polly. l'll bring him down.

139
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:17,105
Would you mind taking your glasses off,
Mrs. Manion?

140
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,610
Gee whiz. Barney Quill do that to you?

141
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,737
Mm-hmm. More than that.

142
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,864
You should see. All over.

143
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,911
Well, you can put them back on
if it's more comfortable for ya.

144
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,256
This is Polly Biegler.
This is the bucko, Polly.

145
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,258
- Lieutenant Manion.
- Ηello there.

146
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,260
- Hi, Manny.
- Hello, Laura.

147
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:54,226
Uh, Mrs. Manion, l wonder if you could meet me
down at my office about 2:00 this afternoon.

148
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,311
lt's 305 West Barnham.

149
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,355
- Of course.
- Fine.

150
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:02,734
- ls there anything l can get you, hon?
- l'm all right, hon.

151
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,321
Right in here.

152
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,628
"Wanted." The big ten.

153
00:15:21,713 --> 00:15:24,631
They got the ten best-dressed dames...

154
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:28,010
the ten top teams, the ten top tunes...

155
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,012
and now, the ten most wanted.

156
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:34,391
Well, don't knock it. That's the American dream.
Those boys made the grade.

157
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:39,646
You were the... district attorney
around here, weren't you?

158
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,648
Mm-hmm. Ten years.

159
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,192
What's your experience as a defense lawyer?

160
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,153
Not very much.

161
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,155
Ηow do l know you can handle my case?

162
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,199
Well, l guess you don't know.

163
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,201
Shall we talk about it?

164
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,788
l suppose so.

165
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:59,499
Well, now, come on, Lieutenant.
Don't be so bored.

166
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:03,211
You know, it might very well be
that no lawyer can handle your case...

167
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,213
if you mean getting off scot-free.

168
00:16:05,298 --> 00:16:08,759
You seem to be forgetting
Barney Quill raped my wife.

169
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,719
l have the unwritten law on my side.

170
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,722
The unwritten law is a myth, Lieutenant.

171
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,600
There is no such thing as the unwritten law...

172
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,728
and anyone who commits a murder
on the theory that it does exist...

173
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,065
has just bought himself
room and board in the state penitentiary.

174
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,900
Maybe for life.

175
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:27,778
Now, with that in mind...

176
00:16:27,862 --> 00:16:33,325
perhaps we can proceed with a few questions
and answers that - that, uh -

177
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,535
Can l borrow your lighter?

178
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:43,168
We can proceed with a few questions and answers
that might be of some help in your defense.

179
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,881
But probably won't be.

180
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,927
Yeah. Nice lighter.

181
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,891
- Okay.
- Well, how old are you?

182
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,268
- Twenty-eight.
- How long have you been in the service?

183
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,729
Since '50.

184
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,107
- You seen any action?
- Korea.

185
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,567
- Have any decorations?
- Plenty.

186
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:09,569
ls this your first marriage?

187
00:17:09,654 --> 00:17:11,238
No.

188
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,408
You're not on the witness stand.
You don't have to answer yes or no.

189
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,411
Just give me the matrimonial rundown.

190
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:21,123
- ls this necessary?
- l'll be the judge of that.

191
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,210
My first wife divorced me.

192
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,130
Charged cruelty.

193
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,133
Eating crackers in bed.
You know, the usual stuff.

194
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:36,388
Truth was, she found another guy
when l was in Korea.

195
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:41,852
l met Laura four years ago in Georgia.

196
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,646
We were married right after her divorce.

197
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:46,773
Did you know the husband?

198
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:50,694
- He was in my outfit down there.
- You mean you were buddies?

199
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,823
l'll withdraw the question.
That's a little old-fashioned.

200
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,410
Ηave there been any children by or from
any of these marriages?

201
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,913
- No.
- Any present prospects?

202
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:04,082
Not unless Barney Quill started something.

203
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,334
What kind of a gun did you use on Quill?

204
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,796
War souvenir. Luger. The police have it now.

205
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:13,341
l suppose you've read the newspapers,
the stories about your case?

206
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,927
- Some of them.
- Are they substantially correct?

207
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,137
Yes.

208
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:20,015
And you didn't see Quill
rape and beat your wife?

209
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:22,142
No. No.

210
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:26,688
When she got back, uh, to the trailer,
she told me what had happened.

211
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,566
Then how long was it
before you went over to Quill's and killed him?

212
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,526
l don't know exactly. Maybe an hour.

213
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,987
That long, huh?

214
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,282
Now, the newspapers say that your wife
volunteered to take a lie detector test.

215
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,034
You know anything about this?

216
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,369
Only what l read and what she told me.

217
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,872
Do you know how
the lie detector test turned out?

218
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,374
- They didn't tell her.
- Yes, Sulo?

219
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,086
Polly, we got lunch served for the jail.
You want to eat with us?

220
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,215
Does your sister still cook for the jail?

221
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,092
- Oh, sure. She cooks.
- Uh-huh.

222
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:59,513
Well, you give her my compliments, Sulo.

223
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:02,557
- l've got a luncheon date downtown.
- Nice going, Mr. Biegler.

224
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,935
- l'll be back after lunch.
- Look, uh...

225
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,479
l'm sorry if l offended you a while ago.

226
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,148
No, you're not.

227
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:13,485
Come on, bucko.

228
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,070
Thank you.

229
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,824
Pass the salt, Polly.

230
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:22,828
Thank you.

231
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,706
Did you give the lieutenant
the well-known lecture?

232
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,627
lf you mean did l coach him
into a phony story, no.

233
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,339
Maybe you're too pure, Paul.

234
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,967
Too pure for the natural impurities of the law.

235
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:42,097
Could be that you owe the lieutenant
a chance to find a defense.

236
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,307
Could also be that you might
guide him a little...

237
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,394
show him the way,
and let him decide if he wants to take it.

238
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:50,146
- Want some salt?
- No. l'm not ready.

239
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,357
Anyway, l'm not the right lawyer
for this fellow.

240
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,860
Ηe's insolent, hostile.

241
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,864
You don't have to love him. Just defend him.

242
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,783
What's the matter? Don't you need a fee?

243
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,663
You know something?
l think you might be a little bit afraid.

244
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,833
- Afraid of what?
- That you might get licked.

245
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:17,507
You know, there's only one thing more devious
than a Philadelphia lawyer...

246
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,718
and that's an lrish lawyer.

247
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,720
Pass the salt.

248
00:20:24,307 --> 00:20:26,224
Put it down. Put it down.

249
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,235
- Ηello there.
- l usually answer to the name Paul.

250
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,321
Are we gonna have some more jokes?

251
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,489
Not unless you want to be the comic.

252
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,033
Oh.

253
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,160
l brought you some cigarettes.

254
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,162
- Oh, thanks.
- Peace?

255
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,332
- Oh, sure.
- Fine, fine. Now, Lieutenant...

256
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:53,960
there are four ways l can defend murder.

257
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,339
Number one, it wasn't murder.
lt was suicide or accidental.

258
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:00,425
Number two, you didn't do it.
Number three, you were legally justified...

259
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,719
like the protection of your home
or self-defense.

260
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,348
Number four, the killing was excusable.

261
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,643
Where do l fit into this rosy picture?

262
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:13,980
l'll tell you where you don't fit.
You don't fit in any of the first three.

263
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:17,817
Why? Why wouldn't l be legally justified
in killing the man who raped my wife?

264
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,486
Time element.

265
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:22,197
lf you'd caught him in the act,
the shooting might have been justified...

266
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,032
but you didn't catch him in the act.

267
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,868
You had time to bring in the police,
and you didn't do that either.

268
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:30,163
You're guilty of murder,
premeditated and with vengeance.

269
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,165
That's first-degree murder in any court of law.

270
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,167
Are you telling me to plead guilty?

271
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,169
When l advise you to cop out, you'll know.

272
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,672
- "Cop out"?
- That's plead guilty and ask for mercy.

273
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:42,175
Well, if you're not telling me to cop out,
what are you telling me to do?

274
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:44,177
l'm not telling you to do anything.

275
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:47,305
l just want you to understand
the letter of the law.

276
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,811
- Go on.
- Go on with what?

277
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,148
Whatever it is you're getting at.

278
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:04,364
You know, you're very bright, Lieutenant.

279
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:09,244
Now let's see how really bright you can be.

280
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:15,417
Well... l'm working at it.

281
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,878
All right. Because your wife was raped...

282
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:21,339
you'll have a favorable atmosphere
in the courtroom.

283
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:24,300
The sympathy will be with you,
if all the facts are true.

284
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:28,513
What you need is a legal peg so that the jury
can hang up their sympathy in your behalf.

285
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:32,058
- You follow me?
- Mm-hmm.

286
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:35,437
What's your legal excuse, Lieutenant?

287
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:40,025
What's your legal excuse
for killing Barney Quill?

288
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,279
Not justification, huh?

289
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,322
Not justification.

290
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,204
Excuse.

291
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:58,668
J-Just excuse.

292
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,100
What excuses are there?

293
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:16,895
How should l know?
You're the one that plugged Quill.

294
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:21,816
- l must've been mad.
- How's that?

295
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,736
l said l must've been mad.

296
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:31,326
No, a bad temper's no excuse.

297
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:36,915
Well, l mean, uh, l - l must've been crazy.

298
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:43,546

00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,382
He's like that.
Ηe gives me presents all the time.

335
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,343
Do you have a happy marriage?

336
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,845
Yes.

337
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,806
What went wrong with the first marriage?

338
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:02,060
Well, what went wrong is when l went for Manny.

339
00:26:02,144 --> 00:26:04,103
Well, that's honest enough.

340
00:26:04,188 --> 00:26:07,440
lt was more than just that.
Like l told you, l grew up on the move...

341
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:10,193
and Jack - that was my first husband -

342
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:14,072
Jack didn't like to move. He wouldn't even
take a transfer when he had the chance.

343
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:16,115
l was really bored.

344
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:20,036
Manny likes to go.
We're always going, whenever we get the chance.

345
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,830
We've been all over. l'm thirsty.

346
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,083
Water? Or would a beer do?

347
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,085
l think a beer would do fine.

348
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,338
Maida, bring me a bottle of beer,
will you?

349
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,759
- Are you married?
- No.

350
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,303
That's nice.

351
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,807
What do you do alone
in this house if you aren't married?

352
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:43,893
Well, it's a family home.
l'm the last of the family.

353
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,937
- There you are.
- Thank you.

354
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:50,358
- Aren't you having one?
- No, not right now. Thanks.

355
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,361
There you are.

356
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,489
Oh, could Muff have a little?
ln that ashtray, maybe. He loves beer.

357
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,033
- You want a beer for the dog?
- Mm-hmm.

358
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:01,536
Well, here we are.

359
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,751
Ηe'll go to sleep now.

360
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,424
- lsn't he cute?
- Yeah.

361
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,843
Well, how about it? Are you ready?

362
00:27:18,554 --> 00:27:21,347
l mean, are you ready to tell me the story?

363
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:23,516
l know what you mean.

364
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,229
Yeah. Well, now, suppose you tell me
everything you told the state police...

365
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:31,733
plus everything you didn't
tell the state police.

366
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:36,904
- Where shall l begin?
- What time did you leave for Quill's bar?

367
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:40,325
Right after dinner. About 8:30, l guess.

368
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,744
Manny was late getting home
from the firing range...

369
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,705
so we had dinner
and he laid down and went to sleep.

370
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,874
l hadn't been out of
the trailer almost all day...

371
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,210
so l took Muff and a flashlight
and walked over to the bar.

372
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,963
l bought a drink
and played the pinball machine.

373
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:55,548
Many people in the bar?

374
00:27:55,632 --> 00:28:00,553
Not many. Barney came over
and challenged me to a game.

375
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,806
- For drinks, you know.
- How well did you know Barney?

376
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:07,435
Well, he owned this bar
where Manny and l went sometimes. That's all.

377
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,023
- Had he ever made a pass at you?
- No. Nothing like that at all.

378
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:14,650
Was he drinking heavily that night?

379
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:18,863
He didn't seem to be.
At least not when we were playing pinball.

380
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,574
Were you with him
the whole time you were there?

381
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,743
Oh, no. There were other people playing too.

382
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,287
What time did you leave the bar?

383
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:29,540
00, l guess.

384
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:32,960
l left by the side door.
Muff was carrying the flashlight.

385
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,921
Ηe carries it in his mouth.

386
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,006
Ηe's so cute running along ahead
with the light shining.

387
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,801
- Was he sober?
- Muff? Of course he was sober.

388
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,803
Oh, you're joking now, aren't you?

389
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:45,223
Yes, l'm joking. Uh, go on.

390
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:49,477
Well, Barney came from somewhere.
Not the door l left by.

391
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,980
And he said he was going my way
and he could drive me home.

392
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:56,692
Ηe said the bears had been prowling around
that night, and l oughtn't to walk home.

393
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:58,986
The bears come out of the woods
at night to scavenge.

394
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:01,114
Yeah, but they're harmless enough,
aren't they?

395
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:03,950
Yeah. l suppose l wouldn't have
been afraid in the daylight...

396
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:06,119
but, well, the dark isn't the same, you know.

397
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:09,372
Yes, l know. l know.
Now, you got into Barney's car.

398
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,707
l got in and he drove
straight to the trailer park.

399
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,709
Ηe made overtures?

400
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,087
No, nothing.
When we got to the trailer park...

401
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,089
the auto gate was closed.

402
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:21,843
Mr. Lemon closes it
00 or a little after.

403
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,512
So l thanked Barney
and started to get out of the car...

404
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,390
but he said that there wasn't
any need for me to walk...

405
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,268
that he could drive me
into the park on another road.

406
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:35,523
l didn't know there was another road,
but he drove on before l could say yes or no.

407
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,025
- Were you alarmed?
- No.

408
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,194
l'm not usually afraid of men.

409
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,823
And anyway, he hadn't touched me
or even said anything out of the way.

410
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:49,328
Well, doesn't a woman sort of instinctively
know when a fellow's on the make?

411
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:52,540
Oh, sure. But that's only usual with me.

412
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,668
With men, l mean - almost all men.
Ever since l was a kid.

413
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,629
You, for instance. You're interested.

414
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:02,633
But there isn't any reason to be afraid of you.
lt was like that with Barney.

415
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,886
Well, now, Mrs. Manion,
believe me, l'm not in the least -

416
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,221
Call me Laura.

417
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,223
Uh, Laura.

418
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,561
l'm only interested in helping your husband.
Nothing more.

419
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,230
Oh, l don't mean you'd try anything.

420
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:20,026
l just mean it's - it's the way you look at me.

421
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,030
Well, it'd be very difficult
not to look at you.

422
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,908
Oh, the way l dress, you mean?
You don't like it?

423
00:30:26,992 --> 00:30:30,036
Oh, l love it. l just love it.

424
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,081
Now, we-we'd better keep
moving along with this thing.

425
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:38,044
Now, uh, how were you dressed that night?

426
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,880
Oh, in a sweater like this and a skirt.

427
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,341
And the rest. What about that?

428
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:44,926
Underneath?

429
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,095
l had on a slip and panties and a bra.

430
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,765
- No girdle?
- l don't need a girdle.

431
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,600
Do you think l need a girdle?

432
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,936
l don't know.

433
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,104
l don't know. Ηow sh - l -

434
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:59,899
Look, l'm only concerned with a few facts...

435
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,610
that might be of help to me
in the defense of your husband.

436
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,363
- That's all.
- Well, l don't wear one.

437
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:09,367
Okay. No girdle. Okay.
All right. Now go on.

438
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:13,162
Well, he turned off the highway
into a lane in the woods...

439
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:16,082
and he stopped the car
and turned off the lights.

440
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,251
And then he grabbed me, and he said...

441
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,670
"l'm gonna rape you,"
just like that.

442
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:23,923
- Did he use those words?
- Exactly those words.

443
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,509
Muff began to bark,
so he threw him out the window.

444
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:30,346
l could hear little Muffy
whining outside the car all through it.

445
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,641
Barney began to try to get at me...

446
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,811
and l fought him off as best l could,
but he was terribly strong.

447
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,230
Did you cry out? Did you scream?

448
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,149
lt didn't seem to be much use
out there in the woods.

449
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:47,154
Ηe began to shout names at me
like "army slut" and some other names.

450
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,824
And then he drew back and hit me with his fist.

451
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,785
Ηe hit me again, and l didn't fight anymore.

452
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:58,249
l must've been only half conscious,
but l know that he tore my panties off...

453
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,251
and did what he wanted.

454
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,379
Now, the newspapers said
that a doctor examined you...

455
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,506
and said that he didn't think you'd been raped.

456
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:09,343
l don't care what the doctor thought.
A woman doesn't mistake these things.

457
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,471
All right. All right. Now go ahead.

458
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:14,140
Well, l -

459
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:18,144
l don't know exactly what happened then.
l must've fainted.

460
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:21,355
But the next thing l remember,
the car was moving.

461
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,610
Barney was driving very fast,
and - and he was breathing hard.

462
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:29,030
An ugly, gasping sound.

463
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,742
We were on the main road to the trailer park...

464
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,578
and he swung in by the gate and stopped.

465
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:39,874
l opened the door to get out. Muffy jumped out
first, with a lighted flashlight in his mouth.

466
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,043
Well, now, wait a minute.
l thought you said...

467
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,545
he'd thrown Muff out of the car
back in the woods.

468
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,256
Well, he did, but Muff was
in the car when we got back.

469
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,216
Ηe must've let him back in. l don't remember.

470
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,845
All right. All right. Now, you opened the door,
and Muff got out first. All right.

471
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,556
Before l could get out, Barney grabbed me...

472
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,893
and said he was gonna
tear all my clothes off and attack me again.

473
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,396
l got away and ran.
l could see Muff at an opening in the fence.

474
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:05,900
Ηe was scooting back and forth
with the flashlight.

475
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,945
Barney caught me from behind,
and l fell to the ground.

476
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,865
Ηe fell on top of me and began
to beat me again with his fists.

477
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:14,867
l thought he was gonna kill me.

478
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:19,580
l screamed, and somehow or other
l got to my feet again and ran.

479
00:33:19,665 --> 00:33:22,249
l went through the opening
in the fence and followed Muffy.

480
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,543
Ηe was running along ahead with the flashlight.

481
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:27,588
And l kept following the light
until he led me to our trailer.

482
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:29,882
And you didn't see Barney again?

483
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,718
Never laid eyes on him again, dead or alive.

484
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,721
Well, l -

485
00:33:35,806 --> 00:33:37,682
l think that's enough for now.

486
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,976
l've got lots of time. All you want.

487
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,355
Where can l reach you?

488
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,191
l'm still in Thunder Bay,
but l can drive down again in the morning.

489
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,781
- Was there something else?
- No.

490
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,462
Thanks for letting me play the records.

491
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,549
- Oh, you're very welcome.
- Thanks a lot. Bye.

492
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,930
- Who's that?
- The lady in the case.

493
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,306
Oh.

494
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,810
And you're not gonna take the case, huh?

495
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:27,148
Well, l don't know. That depends on what Manion
has to tell me tomorrow.

496
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,775
Ηe's thinking things out.

497
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,902
Oh, well, that's more like it.

498
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:35,072
Now, if l take the case, l want you in it.

499
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:39,076
Me? ln a big murder case?

500
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:44,039
Why, Polly, the sight of this whiskey-drinking
old man at the counsel table would ruin you.

501
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,709
l need you.

502
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,836
Do you mean that?

503
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,505
Why else would he say it?

504
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,092
Well, l'd be glad to work with you
outside of the courtroom...

505
00:34:55,177 --> 00:34:57,094
but not in the courtroom.

506
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:01,432
Well, suit yourself about that. Either way,
l'm gonna have to be able to depend on you.

507
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,686
Will you lay off the booze?

508
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:15,571
l don't know. l don't know about that, Polly.

509
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,615
Why don't you know?

510
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,495
Do you think l could lay off the booze?

511
00:35:23,163 --> 00:35:25,498
Ever tried it?

512
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,418
Try it.

513
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:36,133
l've never been on a big murder case.

514
00:35:36,927 --> 00:35:39,470
Not once in all my life.

515
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,472
lt's up to you, Parn.

516
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,773
Will you be around tonight?

517
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:54,360
Yeah. Yeah. l'll be around.

518
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:06,247
You know, Maida, darlin'...

519
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,250
l might manage it.

520
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,378
l might manage to be a real lawyer again.

521
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,673
For a little while anyway.

522
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,262
l tried remembering.

523
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:23,722
There were still some pieces missing.

524
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,226
l remember...

525
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,939
going to Quill's bar with a gun...

526
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,651
and l remember Quill's face behind the bar.

527
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,947
But l don't remember anything else,
not even going home.

528
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,032
Don't you remember firing the gun?

529
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,451
Five shots. That's a lot of noise to forget.

530
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:48,497
Yeah, l remember hearing shots,
but they don't seem to be connected with me.

531
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:50,541
They seemed far away...

532
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:53,919
like somebody else was doing the shooting.

533
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,886
Lieutenant Manion, l'll, uh -
l'll take your case.

534
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,722
Why, thanks. Thanks, Mr. Biegler.

535
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:07,975
All right. Now, there's
the little matter of the fee.

536
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,977
Three thousand dollars.
That's reasonable enough, isn't it?

537
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,979
Oh, sure, sure. More than reasonable.

538
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,064
l'll have to pay you later.
Right now l'm broke.

539
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,525
- You're what?
- l'm broke. l'm flat busted.

540
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:18,986
l don't have three dollars, much less 3,000.

541
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,990
- Well, can you raise it?
- Oh, yeah, as soon as l get outta jail.

542
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,076
But, uh, next week's payday.

543
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,079
l'll, uh -
l'll be able to give you $1 50.

544
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:32,374
And if you get me off, l'll give you
a promissory note for the rest.

545
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:36,128
All right. Now, suppose l don't go along
with you unless you pay me half the fee?

546
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,215
Well, l'll have to take
the lawyer the court appoints.

547
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,928
- l got my defense now. Right? lnsanity.
- Yeah.

548
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,847
l think l'll stick around
and make damn sure you get off.

549
00:37:46,932 --> 00:37:51,143
- Where do we start?
- We're gonna need a psychiatrist.

550
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:55,397
As much as neither one of us has any money,
do you think the army'll stir one up for you?

551
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:57,399
Well, l know a colonel in the Pentagon.

552
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,610
- l'll write a letter.
- Good. Do that. Sulo.

553
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,284
Where are you going now?

554
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:09,662
l'm going to see your wife, for one thing.

555
00:38:09,746 --> 00:38:12,206
Why? Didn't you see her yesterday?

556
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,333
That's right. l did.

557
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,627
She's a very pretty woman, your wife.

558
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:21,173
- A man gets used to the way his wife looks.
- Yeah. l can see that.

559
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,175
l'll see ya.

560
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:42,277
Come on in, Polly. Come on in.

561
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,989
You haven't been in here since you vacated,
have you, Polly?

562
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:47,491
- No.
- Hardly recognize the old place, huh?

563
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:50,077
Mary did it for me.
She just finished a decorator's course.

564
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,579
Smart girl.
Very smart girl. Look at this.

565
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,416
- A real, genuine Picasso print.
- lt's very nice.

566
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,585
And here, try this chair.
lt sort of does things for you.

567
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,754
- Ηuh?
- Yeah. Sit right down.

568
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:04,258
Great, isn't it? Good for the nerves, they say.

569
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,928
- Yeah. Ηow do you shut it off?
- There. Ηere we are.

570
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,681
- Feel better?
- l feel all shook up.

571
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,141
Whew!

572
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:17,354
Uh, Mitch, l just dropped by to tell you
l've got both feet in the Manion case.

573
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:19,398
- You're going to cop out, aren't you?
- No.

574
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:23,068
- That's a mistake, Polly. lt's open and shut.
- Well, maybe. We'll see.

575
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,070
Judge Maitland is still in the hospital.

576
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:27,614
Maybe you'd like to agree
to a continuance until he gets back.

577
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,908
lf we go with the case now,
we'll have to try...

578
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:32,202
before some grab-bag judge they'll send in.

579
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,872
- Me, l'd rather have Maitland.
- Yeah. So would l.

580
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:38,042
But of course that'd also mean my client
would lie around in jail...

581
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:40,502
for another two, three months
before the trial.

582
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:44,298
Now, if you'll drop the charge
down to manslaughter...

583
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,217
so l can get him out on bail,
we'll agree to a continuance.

584
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,636
You wouldn't do that if you were still D.A.

585
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:52,139
Oh, l don't know. l might.

586
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:55,142
l might, since a great big fat
lie detector test on his wife...

587
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,561
has given proof to the rape story.

588
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:01,023
- He'd have the jury with him.
- How did you know what the lie -

589
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,025
- Bit, didn't l?
- Yeah. You did.

590
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,652
Anyway, the result of a lie detector test
isn't admissible evidence.

591
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:09,490
- You can't use it.
- No, but it carries moral weight.

592
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:12,951
Mitch, l wouldn't sit in that chair too much.

593
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,454
lt could shake a fellow's brains loose.

594
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,456
l'll see you later.

595
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:28,425
Ηe remembers you, Paul. Ηe likes you.

596
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,427
He likes the beer in my icebox.

597
00:40:30,512 --> 00:40:32,805
Well, what's the occasion today?
A buffalo hunt?

598
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:35,933
l bought these in Arizona
when we were stationed there.

599
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:39,937
- Aren't they smart? l think they're very smart.
- Ηere. We can sit in my car.

600
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,695
Ηere you are.

601
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,782
Ηere you go, Muffy.

602
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,118
Several things have occurred to me.

603
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:56,161
The, uh -

604
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:59,873
The undergarments
that Barney Quill tore off.

605
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,376
Who has them now? The police?

606
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,545
You mean my panties?

607
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,547
All right. Your panties.

608
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,549
l haven't seen them since.

609
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,551
l gave the torn skirt
and sweater to the police...

610
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:14,221
and then l went with them up that lane
into the woods to look for the panties.

611
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:18,350
- But we couldn't find anything but my glasses.
- Your glasses?

612
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,394
You mean you were wearing glasses
through all that?

613
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,313
No. l had them in a case in my hand.

614
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,233
l wear them for reading, playing pinball.
Things like that.

615
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,735
l must've tried to get
out of the car and dropped them.

616
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,696
Uh-huh.

617
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,366
You, uh, might be interested to know
that your lie detector test...

618
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,577
turned out in your favor.

619
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:39,496
Of course it did. l could've told you it would.

620
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:44,168
- You weren't worried about it?
- No. Why should l be?

621
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,838
Would you like to have
something to worry about?

622
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,548
Silly.

623
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,925
Like your husband watching us
from his cell window?

624
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:59,057
All right. All right. Let's have it.

625
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:03,770
- Did he say something to you?
- Just enough.

626
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,898
Are you afraid of him?

627
00:42:06,608 --> 00:42:08,442
Yes.

628
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,612
ls that why you volunteered
for a lie detector test? For him?

629
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:15,532
- Yeah.
- Mmm. Does he have reason to be jealous?

630
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,952
Ηe was jealous even before we were married.

631
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,121
l should have known how it would be.

632
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,708
lt's funny though. Ηe - Ηe likes to show me off.

633
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,960
Ηe likes me to dress the way l do.

634
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:30,005
And then he gets furious
if a man pays any attention to me.

635
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,091
l've tried to leave him, but l can't.

636
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,177
Ηe begs. l give in.

637
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,848
Now, if you think l've forgotten
my question, l haven't.

638
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,976
- l have.
- All right.

639
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,437
All right. Then l'll ask it again.

640
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:48,565
Does your husband
have any reason to be jealous?

641
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,652
No.

642
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,154
Not once. Not ever.

643
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,669
All right? You like the place all right?

644
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,130
l was just lookin' at these pictures.

645
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:20,801
- That was Barney Quill, wasn't it?
- That's right. Barney Quill.

646
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:23,261
- l'm Paul Biegler -
- l know who you are.

647
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:25,597
Seen you around lron City.

648
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:29,893
- You didn't tell me your name.
- Paquette. We don't open till 5:00.

649
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,563
That's all right. l can wait.
l don't have the shakes yet.

650
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,775
You were on the job that night, weren't you?

651
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:39,069
The night Barney Quill was killed.

652
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,488
Like the newspaper said, l was present.

653
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:45,117
You were the fellow that stopped
Lieutenant Manion outside.

654
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:48,662
That's right. Ηe, uh -
Ηe pointed the gun at me and said...

655
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,497
"You want some too, buster?"

656
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,166
And you said no,
because your name isn't buster.

657
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:55,752
There wasn't anything funny
about it, Mr. Biegler.

658
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:58,463
No. There wasn't. l'm sorry. l'm sorry.

659
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:02,175
Where were you when Barney Quill
was killed, Mr. Paquette?

660
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,639
l gather you don't want to
talk about that night, huh?

661
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,183
That's right.
l don't want to talk about it.

662
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,228
Ηave to talk to me about it in court.
Why not now?

663
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,565
Because l don't have to now.
Reason enough, okay?

664
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:17,858
Okay.

665
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:23,697
Okay. Boy, old Barney, he was kind of
a rugged character, wasn't he?

666
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:27,868
Ex-prize fighter, muscle man.
Fancy with guns.

667
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:30,370
Ηe paid his debts, ran a clean place.

668
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:33,415
- Me, l liked him.
- You run the place now?

669
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:37,043
No, l just work here. Mary's running things.

670
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,296
Mary. Was that Barney's wife?

671
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,591
No. Ηe wasn't - Ηe didn't have a wife.
Mary was his manager.

672
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:46,553
Oh. Gee, l wonder
who's gonna inherit the place.

673
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,015
- Mary, l guess.
- Hmm, Mary again?

674
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,017
What's the matter with that?

675
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:55,187
You mean what's the matter with Mary?
l don't know what's the matter with Mary.

676
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:57,147
Mary what?

677
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,065
Pilant. Mary Pilant.

678
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,067
She's in the back booth.

679
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:04,404
We don't talk about our customers here,
but if we did -

680
00:47:04,489 --> 00:47:07,532
- Which we don't -
- Thank you.

681
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:10,202
That's her. That's Mary Pilant.

682
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:21,296
Do you know Lieutenant Manion's wife?

683
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,673
Sure. l know the lieutenant too.

684
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:26,593
Ηe's a good officer. She's all right too.

685
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,054
Friendly. Good kid.

686
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,056
What do you know about it?
Knock it off.

687
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,934
l didn't mean anything.
She's a dish. What's the matter with that?

688
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:36,561
You want this lawyer to get wrong ideas?

689
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,856
What chances has the lieutenant got,
Mr. McCarthy?

690
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:43,693
Pretty good, l'd say,
with a couple of character witnesses like you.

691
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:50,408
l'd like to help him out. l sure would,
but we're moving out. The whole outfit. Berlin.

692
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,911
Oh. Uh, tell me...

693
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,830
who is this babe at the hotel?

694
00:47:55,915 --> 00:48:00,502
Name's Mary Pilant.
She was Quill's private property.

695
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,059
- Would you like a table, sir?
- Yes, please.

696
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,735
- Will you be alone?
- l'll be joined by two others.

697
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:29,406
- May l take your hat?
- Well, thank you. Thank you very much.

698
00:48:36,372 --> 00:48:38,290
Ηow was the manicure?

699
00:48:38,374 --> 00:48:41,501
Just ask me any questions about anybody.
l've got all the dope.

700
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:44,588
Well, can you tell me about a woman
by the name of Mary Pilant?

701
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,339
Easy.

702
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:50,594
Mary Pilant may or may not
have been the mistress of the late B. Quill.

703
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:53,680
- Oh?
- The manicurist is in favor of the mistress theory...

704
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,682
but the hairdresser is agin it.

705
00:48:55,766 --> 00:49:00,520
Ηowever, they both agree that some sort of
hanky-panky must've been going on.

706
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,689
- To be continued.
- Menu?

707
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,691
Thank you.

708
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:08,653
- Pretty, huh?
- Yes, she's very pretty.

709
00:49:08,738 --> 00:49:10,530
Well, go on. Go on.

710
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:15,035
Well, anyway, there's one story that says
that Barney's wild night with Mrs. Manion...

711
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,204
was somehow triggered by Mary Pilant.

712
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:22,208
Seemed she'd been running around
with some soldier, and Barney blew his stack.

713
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:25,712
- He got tanked up and exploded.
- ls Mary Pilant local?

714
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:29,841
No, she's a Canadian. Barney brought her in here
to sort of dress up the place...

715
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:31,926
and she stayed on to manage it for him.

716
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:36,222
- Looks like she's done all right.
- Better than all right. She's in for the estate.

717
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:39,976
Oh? She doesn't look like a bad sort, does she?

718
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:43,730
- Hmm? Where?
- What do you mean, where?

719
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:47,108
- The pretty one with the menus.
- This girl right here?

720
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:55,450
Uh, Miss Pilant, may l introduce myself?

721
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,911
l'm Paul Biegler,
attorney for Lieutenant Manion.

722
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,080
This is Mrs. Rutledge
and Mr. McCarthy, my associates.

723
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:03,166
- Ηow do you do?
- l wonder if you could sit with us for a minute?

724
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,752
- Yes, l can take a minute.
- Thank you.

725
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:10,674
l'd like to ask you a few things,
if you don't mind.

726
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:13,093
What sort of things, Mr. Biegler?

727
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:16,721
Well, like what kind of a man
your employer was, Mr. Quill.

728
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:18,348
A very nice man.

729
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:22,185
lf that's true, how do you explain
what happened with Lieutenant Manion's wife?

730
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,271
l don't know what happened
with Lieutenant Manion's wife...

731
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,982
so there really isn't anything
for me to explain, is there?

732
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:31,277
Your loyalty to the dead Mr. Quill
is very touching, Miss Pilant.

733
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,947
Barney was well liked here
by everyone, Mr. Biegler.

734
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:38,535
lt was very generous of everyone to overlook
his little faults, like raping other men's wives.

735
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:41,830
lf you'll pardon me...

736
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:44,624
the waitress will take your order
when you're ready.

737
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:49,254
Nice to have met you, Mr. Biegler,
Mr. McCarthy, Mrs. Rutledge.

738
00:50:51,424 --> 00:50:54,217
You've just been ginned, Lieutenant.

739
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:58,388
- Ten, twenty -
- Manion.

740
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:04,644
- Any word, Lieutenant?
- Yeah.

741
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:07,605
Uh, this. From Washington.

742
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:10,608
They'll let a doctor come to testify,
but there's a string on it.

743
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:14,446
They want me to go to an army hospital
in Detroit for an examination.

744
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:18,491
Doesn't the army understand you're in jail
on a non-bailable offense?

745
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,493
That's it, as far as the army's concerned.

746
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:23,580
l don't know how l can get around this.
l'll try and think of something.

747
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:26,958
Look. My wife hasn't been here for two days.
Ηave you seen her?

748
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,753
- No, not for a while.
- Where the hell is she?

749
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:32,046
You've got other things
to worry about, Lieutenant.

750
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:35,049
Now, l'll get in touch with your wife.
l'll tell her you miss her.

751
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,093
Yeah. You tell her that.

752
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:40,889
- Thanks, Sulo.
- Okay, Polly.

753
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:47,187
l know just how you feel, Lieutenant.

754
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:51,191
l'd be tearin' my hair out too
if l had something like that outside.

755
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:56,863
- Something like what outside?
- Man, you know what l mean.

756
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,241
Something like that,
running around on the loose.

757
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:08,124
Now, what's the big noise, buckoes?

758
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,171
lt's me, dummy.
l hit my elbow on this lousy iron bar.

759
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:16,382
Oh. You want some rubbing alcohol, maybe?

760
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:19,135
Nah. But a little bourbon might help.

761
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:23,556
Knock it off. Knock it off, buckoes.

762
00:52:23,641 --> 00:52:25,642
Let's finish the game, Lieutenant.

763
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:58,842
Oh! Hey!
What a crazy lawyer we've got.

764
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:02,220
Hiya, Polly.
That's what they call you, isn't it? Polly?

765
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:05,473
That's a crazy name for a crazy lawyer!

766
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:15,775
Thanks for letting me sit in, Pie-Eye.

767
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,278
- Hey, you're not splittin' the scene, man?
- Ηuh?

768
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:21,155
- l mean, you're not cuttin' out?
- No, l'll be back.

769
00:53:40,885 --> 00:53:43,803
- Well, hi, Polly. Fellas, this is Manny's lawyer.
- Ηi.

770
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,597
- Ηow are ya?
- Sit down, won't you?

771
00:53:45,681 --> 00:53:50,310
Sorry, l can't right now. Mrs. Manion,
may l talk to you for a moment, outside?

772
00:53:50,394 --> 00:53:53,980
"Mrs. Manion"? l thought
we dropped the formalities a long time ago.

773
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,816
l think maybe we'd better pick them up again.
This is important.

774
00:53:56,901 --> 00:53:59,402
- All right. l'll go with you.
- All right, come on.

775
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:03,197
- Hey! You're coming back, aren't you?
- Sure. What do you think?

776
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:16,711
- See ya later, Pie-Eye.
- Okay.

777
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:27,805
- Did you get my phone message?
- Yeah, but l got busy.

778
00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:29,807
Why haven't you been to see your husband?

779
00:54:29,892 --> 00:54:32,060
l don't see why l have to see him every day.

780
00:54:32,144 --> 00:54:34,395
l think it'd be a very good idea if you did.

781
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,731
All right. l'll see him every day. Okay?

782
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,942
No, not okay. Now, where's your car?

783
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:41,569
- l came with them.
- All right. Mine's right over here. Come on.

784
00:54:41,654 --> 00:54:43,571
Ηey, wait a second! l've got friends inside.

785
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:46,491
- Friends or no friends, you're goin' home.
- Who do you think you are?

786
00:54:46,575 --> 00:54:49,369
l'm the lawyer trying to beat a rap
for your husband! Do you remember?

787
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,455
- What's that got to do with -
- Wait. Now, you listen. You listen.

788
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,458
Now, until this trial is over, you're gonna be
a meek little housewife...

789
00:54:55,542 --> 00:55:00,129
with horn-rimmed spectacles, and you're gonna
stay away from men and juke joints...

790
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,548
and booze and pinball machines...

791
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,259
and you're gonna wear
a skirt and low-heeled shoes...

792
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:08,179
and you're gonna wear a girdle -
and especially a girdle.

793
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:12,892
Look, Laura, believe me, l don't usually
complain of an attractive jiggle, but just -

794
00:55:12,977 --> 00:55:16,854
You save that jiggle for your husband to look at,
if and when l get him out of jail.

795
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:18,856
Now come on. Let's go.

796
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,276
l'm sorry. l really am.

797
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:24,529
l wouldn't hurt Manny's chances for anything.

798
00:55:24,613 --> 00:55:26,531
Come on. Come on.

799
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:06,946
ls this about where Barney knocked you down?

800
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:09,240
Yeah. Right over here.

801
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:11,242
Over there is the opening in the fence...

802
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,786
where Muffy was running
back and forth with the flashlight.

803
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:18,541
Where's your trailer?

804
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,085
Up there on the hill.

805
00:56:26,717 --> 00:56:28,843
This is my favorite place.

806
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:37,769
Sometimes when Manny was sleeping,
l'd come out here and just sit.

807
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:41,606
l had to get out of that trailer. l couldn't
stand being cooped up all the time.

808
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:46,986
l'm - l'm lonely, Paul.

809
00:56:47,071 --> 00:56:49,113
l'm awful lonely.

810
00:56:49,198 --> 00:56:52,867
l wouldn't have gone to that roadhouse
if it weren't for that, you know.

811
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:56,245
Maybe you're getting in
some good practice being lonely.

812
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:59,248
You mean you think
maybe Manny won't get off?

813
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:02,543
That'll be up to the jury,
and you can never tell about them.

814
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:05,171
lf he didn't, it'd be one way to end it.

815
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:09,092
No. l don't mean that.
l - l may think it sometimes...

816
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:11,552
but l don't really want it.

817
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:28,402
Ηello, sweetie. Did ya miss me?

818
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:30,446
Of course you missed me.

819
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:35,201
You wanna come in, Paul?

820
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,620
You can if you want to, you know.

821
00:57:38,956 --> 00:57:41,290
No, thank you, Laura.

822
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:45,336
l'm sorry l had to spoil
your fun over at that place. l -

823
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:50,299
- Good night, Laura.
- Good night.

824
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:20,121
Ηear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

825
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:25,126
The Circuit Court for the County of lron Cliffs
is now in session.

826
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,170
You can be seated.

827
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:36,512
For those of you l haven't met,
my name is Weaver.

828
00:58:36,597 --> 00:58:41,267
l'm from downstate, and l'm sitting temporarily
while your good Judge Maitland...

829
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,936
is recovering from a severe illness.

830
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:47,315
There's no need, l think,
to dwell at length upon my methods.

831
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:50,026
One judge is quite like another.

832
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:53,946
The only differences may be in the state
of their digestions...

833
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:57,408
or their proclivities
for sleeping on the bench.

834
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:00,870
For myself, l can digest pig iron.

835
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:05,875
And while l might appear to doze occasionally,
you'll find that l'm easily awakened...

836
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:11,255
particularly if shaken gently
by a good lawyer with a nice point of law.

837
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:16,761
We will now take up the criminal docket.
Case number one.

838
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:19,931
The PeopIe versus CIarence Madigan.

839
00:59:20,015 --> 00:59:22,808
Breaking and entering in the nighttime.

840
00:59:22,893 --> 00:59:25,978
Will the defendant rise and come forward?

841
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,022
That's me, Your Honor.

842
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,366
"State of Michigan, Court of lron Cliffs.

843
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,493
l, Mitchell Lodwick, prosecuting attorney...

844
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,537
come into said county of lron Cliffs
and give the court to understand...

845
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:45,539
that one Clarence Madigan...

846
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:49,168
alias 'One-Shot' Madigan,
alias 'Smoky' Madigan...

847
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:51,337
did break and enter
the dwelling house of Casper Katz...

848
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,340
and did there commit the felony
of larceny on said premises."

849
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,427
Does Mr. Madigan have an attorney?

850
00:59:58,512 --> 01:00:02,306
Oh, no. A man's gotta have money
to ask them fellas the time of day.

851
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,934
Mr. Madigan, if you're impoverished,
it's my duty...

852
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,520
to appoint an attorney on your behalf.

853
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:11,190
Oh, l wouldn't bother, Your Honor.
l stole the whiskey.

854
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:13,150
l'm guilty as hell.

855
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,528
lt was a full case of expensive bourbon,
Your Ηonor.

856
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,864
- Did you sell this whiskey?
- Oh, no. l drank it.

857
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,741
- All of it?
- You bet, Judge.

858
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:24,161
Are you aware that it will be necessary
to punish you for this crime?

859
01:00:24,246 --> 01:00:26,205
lt was worth it, Your Ηonor.

860
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:30,459
Well, l'll accept your plea of guilty, Mr. Madigan.
You'll be sentenced later.

861
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:33,838
- You may now return to your place.
- Thanks, Your Honor.

862
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:40,720
Case number two.
The PeopIe versus Frederick Manion.

863
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:42,972
murder.

864
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:47,685
Paul Biegler for the defendant.
My formal appearance is already on file.

865
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,563
Which of these men is your client,
Mr. Biegler?

866
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,982
- None of them, Your Honor.
- Mr. Sheriff...

867
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,443
will you produce the prisoner?

868
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:59,071
Well, l - l'm afraid l can't do that,
Your Honor.

869
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:02,491
Perhaps someone should explain.
l'm not clairvoyant.

870
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:06,829
The defendant is in Detroit being examined
by a psychiatrist, Your Honor.

871
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,873
Shouldn't the court have been consulted...

872
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:11,917
before the defendant
was allowed to leave its jurisdiction?

873
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,879
Well, Your Honor, we're dealing
with the army in this matter...

874
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:18,257
and this was the only crack the army
would give us at one of their psychiatrists.

875
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:20,426
The court was not present,
and it was very urgent...

876
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:23,095
that we get the defendant to the psychiatrist.

877
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,514
What does the attorney
for the People say to this?

878
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,350
lt was done with my knowledge, Your Honor.

879
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:32,438
l've always heard that this Upper Peninsula
of our fair state was a queer place.

880
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:37,443
lf it's customary here to allow a man charged
with first-degree murder to wander about at will...

881
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:41,197
l don't suppose it behooves
an outsider to point out...

882
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:45,326
that the law makes no provision
for such quaint liberalism.

883
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:50,206
Your Honor, the defendant is in the care
of a deputy and will be returned this afternoon.

884
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:53,959
We'll formally arraign
the defendant on his return.

885
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:57,463
For the sake of the docket,
can you give me a clue as to his plea?

886
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,758
The defendant will waive reading
of the information and stand mute.

887
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:03,302
A plea of not guilty will be entered.

888
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:08,140
The case of Frederick Manion
will be placed first on the trial docket.

889
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:21,028
Can you hurry it up, Polly?
Somebody tells that judge...

890
01:02:21,113 --> 01:02:24,824
the prisoner was lounging around the railroad
station, he'll really give me the works.

891
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:26,700
- Just take a minute, Sheriff.
- Okay.

892
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:29,036
Thank you. Come on over here.

893
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:34,708
Well, Lieutenant, how'd things turn out?

894
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:37,169
- l was temporarily insane.
- Did he tell you that?

895
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:40,464
Yeah. Said he's gonna write you a letter...

896
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:43,342
but, uh, l took some notes on my own.

897
01:02:43,427 --> 01:02:45,803
- Doctor's name is Smith.
- Smith.

898
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:50,182
Anatole Ludwig Smith
or, uh, Ludwig von Smith, l hope.

899
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:53,436
- A name like that would impress the jury.
- No, just plain Matthew Smith.

900
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:58,441
He said that when l shot Quill,
l was suffering from "dissociative reaction."

901
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:02,445
Dissociative reaction.
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it, Parn?

902
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:05,322
- Yeah. What does it mean in plain English?
- Well, it means l had...

903
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:08,576
"an irresistible impulse to shoot Quill."

904
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:12,955
That's okay, isn't it?

905
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,374
Yeah, but what did he say
about your knowing the difference...

906
01:03:15,459 --> 01:03:17,543
between right and wrong when you shot Quill?

907
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:20,421
l don't think he said anything.
Why? ls that important?

908
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:24,133
We better not keep the sheriff waiting.
You better go.

909
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,475
Thank you, Sheriff.

910
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:47,907
You ever heard of a Michigan court
accepting irresistible impulse as insanity?

911
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:51,243
No. Maybe we better switch to self-defense.

912
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:53,662
Even Mitch Lodwick would make
a monkey out of us on that.

913
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:56,415
Damn strawberry soda.

914
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,834
- Here. Want a peanut?
- No, thanks.

915
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:01,795
Well, tomorrow's Saturday.

916
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,381
We just have the weekend before the trial.

917
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:08,677
- When do you want to start working?
- Tomorrow morning, early.

918
01:05:03,984 --> 01:05:06,402
- Polly!
- Hey, listen to this, Parn.

919
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:09,238
Never mind that. Just find...

920
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:15,160
PeopIe versus Durfee,
62 Michigan, 486. Year 1 886.

921
01:05:15,245 --> 01:05:17,496
Yeah, that's it.
l have it right here in the A.L.R.

922
01:05:17,581 --> 01:05:21,584
Listen. "The right-and-wrong test,
though condemned as being unscientific...

923
01:05:21,668 --> 01:05:23,627
is adhered to by most of the states, but" -

924
01:05:23,712 --> 01:05:28,007
Listen to this "but." "But the fact
that one accused of committing a crime...

925
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:33,012
may have been able to comprehend
the nature and the consequences of this act...

926
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:36,390
and to know that it was wrong, nevertheless" -

927
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:39,351
Dear, sweet, endearing word, "nevertheless"!

928
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:44,857
"Nevertheless, if he was forced
to its execution by an impulse -

929
01:05:44,941 --> 01:05:47,985
by an impulse which he was
powerless to control...

930
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,696
he will be excused from punishment."

931
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:54,408
Why, the Michigan Supreme Court
did accept irresistible impulse, Parn.

932
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:58,537
This is precedent.
Boy, l think we got ahold of something here.

933
01:05:58,622 --> 01:06:01,206
Good old Durfee, 1 886.

934
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,417
Ηow about that? Give me a pad.

935
01:06:04,002 --> 01:06:07,880
By the saints, this strawberry soda pop
is beginning to taste like real bourbon whiskey.

936
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:11,550
Well, don't get drunk yet.
You know, we've got to convince a jury...

937
01:06:11,635 --> 01:06:14,637
that our client was irresistibly impulsed.

938
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,305
Remember that.

939
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:19,933
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

940
01:06:20,018 --> 01:06:23,729
before we proceed further,
it will be necessary for me to examine you...

941
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:27,650
on your qualifications to sit as jurors.

942
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:30,319
Will you please remember
that you are under oath?

943
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,946
Are all of you citizens?

944
01:06:33,031 --> 01:06:35,699
Will you please raise your hand if you are not.

945
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:53,550
Are there any justices of the peace
or law enforcement officers among you?

946
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:55,803
No.

947
01:06:55,887 --> 01:07:00,808
Are any of you related by blood or marriage
to any law enforcement officer?

948
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:03,769
- No.
- So much for qualifications.

949
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,605
l will now examine for cause.

950
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:10,943
Do any of you have any business pending with
the prosecuting attorney, Mitchell Lodwick?

951
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:12,903
No.

952
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:18,242
Do any of you have any business pending
with Paul Biegler, attorney for the defense?

953
01:07:18,326 --> 01:07:19,618
No.

954
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:22,079
Are any of you acquainted with the defendant...

955
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:24,748
sitting there on Mr. Biegler's left?

956
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:27,626
- No.
- Will Mrs. Laura Manion...

957
01:07:27,711 --> 01:07:29,920
the defendant's wife please stand?

958
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:34,466
- Do any of you know Mrs. Manion?
- No.

959
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:37,261
Thank you, Mrs. Manion.
You may be seated.

960
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:40,639
Counsel may challenge the jury for cause.

961
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:46,270
Your Honor, before counsel's challenge,
may l introduce Mr. Claude Dancer to the court?

962
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:49,440
Mr. Dancer is an assistant attorney general
from Lansing.

963
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:53,694
Because of the peculiar nature of this case,
l have requested the attorney general...

964
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:56,238
to allow Mr. Dancer to sit in
with the prosecution.

965
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:58,949
Your reputation precedes you, Mr. Dancer.

966
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:01,326
lt's a privilege to have you in my court.

967
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:04,329
Thank you, Your Ηonor.
l'm sure it will be instructive.

968
01:08:04,414 --> 01:08:07,082
Do any of you jurors
have any business pending...

969
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:09,168
before the attorney general's office?

970
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:10,753
No.

971
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:14,757
l must apologize for my disparaging remarks...

972
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,634
about the Upper Peninsula and its customs.

973
01:08:17,719 --> 01:08:22,890
l've seldom seen a murder jury
selected and sworn in less than half a day.

974
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:26,185
You have won my heart completely, gentlemen.

975
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:29,688
Now, Mr. Dancer, you asked for the recess.
What's your problem?

976
01:08:29,773 --> 01:08:32,608
There was a little suggestion
l wanted to make, Your Honor.

977
01:08:32,692 --> 01:08:36,361
- By all means.
- Since the defense plea is insanity...

978
01:08:36,446 --> 01:08:38,697
the prosecution has retained a psychiatrist.

979
01:08:38,782 --> 01:08:41,658
Under the statute, we have the right
to petition for a mental examination...

980
01:08:41,743 --> 01:08:43,827
of the defendant by our own doctor.

981
01:08:43,912 --> 01:08:45,954
Are you familiar with that statute,
Mr. Biegler?

982
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:48,207
Uh-huh. Moderately.

983
01:08:48,291 --> 01:08:50,793
l think it would only
delay things to file a formal petition...

984
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:53,212
so why don't we just, uh,
get together and sort of...

985
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:55,297
informally agree to ask Ηis Ηonor
for an adjournment?

986
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:58,258
Only a day or so,
and our doctor can visit with the defendant.

987
01:08:58,343 --> 01:09:01,345
l think it would save everyone
a great deal of time. Don't you, Mr. Biegler?

988
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,388
- Yes, l'm sure it will.
- Good.

989
01:09:03,473 --> 01:09:08,227
But suppose you just go ahead
and file that formal petition anyway.

990
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:10,312
Of course, you're a little late, aren't ya?

991
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,314
Well, maybe Ηis Ηonor will overlook that.

992
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,483
And then, l'd sort of like the jury to see...

993
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:17,194
that you think our insanity plea
has some merit.

994
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,738
There really won't be any need for our doctor
to examine your client.

995
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:21,740
Naturally, l was only following
the usual procedure.

996
01:09:21,825 --> 01:09:23,742
- Well, naturally, l'm all for it.
- Uh-huh.

997
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:26,370
Do you wish to file the petition or not,
Mr. Dancer?

998
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,205
- Yes, Your Ηonor -
- lt won't be necessary.

999
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:29,998
That's right. lt won't be necessary at all.

1000
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:33,877
Skirmish over.
Shall we join now on the field of battle?

1001
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:42,010
The body of Quill had sustained
five gunshot wounds.

1002
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:45,013
One of the bullets
had passed through the heart.

1003
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:48,767
Death, in my opinion,
was almost instantaneous...

1004
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:50,769
and was directly caused by this wound.

1005
01:09:50,854 --> 01:09:54,898
- Dr. Raschid, may l have your detailed report?
- Certainly.

1006
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:59,027
l ask that this report be marked
People's Exhibit One for identification.

1007
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:01,321
So received and marked.

1008
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:04,032
The People hand the defense
a copy of the report.

1009
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:06,618
Counsel may cross-examine.

1010
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:11,623
Dr. Raschid, your primary purpose was to
ascertain the cause of death, was it not?

1011
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:12,833
Yes.

1012
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:15,961
And yet, l read in your report here,
that you checked...

1013
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:18,505
to determine whether
spermatogenesis was occurring...

1014
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:20,966
in the body of the deceased
at the time of death.

1015
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:25,888
Objection, Your Ηonor. The People
call this witness only to show the cause of death.

1016
01:10:25,972 --> 01:10:28,599
Your Ηonor, the entire report
was offered as evidence...

1017
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:31,727
and the report contains this information
about spermatogenesis.

1018
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:35,022
Overruled, Mr. Lodwick.
The witness may answer.

1019
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:38,650
Yes, l made that examination on the deceased.

1020
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:41,737
Now, would you tell the court your findings?

1021
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:44,781
Spermatogenesis was occurring
at the time of death.

1022
01:10:44,866 --> 01:10:49,369
ln other words, the deceased, in life,
was not sterile. He could produce children.

1023
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:51,413
- That is correct.
- Now, Doctor...

1024
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:55,834
if a woman says that she has had
intercourse with a certain man...

1025
01:10:55,919 --> 01:11:00,005
and the man is proved fertile, even though
no evidence is found in the woman's body...

1026
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,382
could a lawyer - say a prosecuting attorney -

1027
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:06,011
could he use this as evidence
that the woman is lying?

1028
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:10,766
Your Ηonor.
l, uh, object to this line of questioning.

1029
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,935
We're not concerned here with whether or not...

1030
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:15,437
there have been relations
between a man and a woman.

1031
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:18,857
Your Ηonor, as long as an examination
for spermatogenesis has been made...

1032
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,692
at least we're entitled to know why.

1033
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,527
Overruled. You may answer.

1034
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:25,572
Yes. Prosecution could use that...

1035
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:29,201
though it certainly
would not be conclusive that she was lying.

1036
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,954
- Why not?
- There could be several reasons...

1037
01:11:32,038 --> 01:11:33,956
why the test on her was negative.

1038
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,084
The, uh, use of a contraceptive...

1039
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:40,963
or - or possibly there was no completion
on the part of the man.

1040
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,882
Now, on this postmortem were you also asked
to determine whether or not...

1041
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:48,136
the deceased had reached
a sexual climax shortly before his death?

1042
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:50,764
- No, sir.
- Could you have made such a determination?

1043
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,349
Oh, yes.

1044
01:11:52,433 --> 01:11:55,143
So you were only asked
to make such examination...

1045
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:58,230
as might be useful to the prosecution,
none that might help the defense?

1046
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:02,359
l object, Your Ηonor.
The question is argumentative.

1047
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,987
Counsel for the defense
is trying to impugn the intent...

1048
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:06,989
of the representatives of the People.

1049
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:10,242
Mr. Biegler, you must be aware
that the question is improper.

1050
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,911
l withdraw the question, Your Honor,
and apologize.

1051
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:15,414
The question and answer will be stricken...

1052
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:19,084
and the jury will disregard
both the question and the answer.

1053
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,754
- That's all the questions l had.
- No redirect.

1054
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:26,091
The People now call Lloyd Burke.

1055
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,802
Will the witness step forward, please.

1056
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:36,184
How can a jury disregard
what it's already heard?

1057
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:40,772
They can't, Lieutenant. They can't.

1058
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:44,276
...the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1059
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,445
- l do.
- Sit down, please.

1060
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,614
Will you state your profession,
please, Mr. Burke?

1061
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:53,869
- l'm a commercial photographer.
- Were you called upon by the police...

1062
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:57,789
to take photographs
of the body of the deceased Bernard Quill...

1063
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,751
before and after he was removed
from the scene of death?

1064
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:02,002
Yes, sir, l was.

1065
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:04,838
Were these photographs
of the deceased made by you?

1066
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:11,386
They were.

1067
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:13,388
The reporter will please mark
these photographs...

1068
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:16,391
People's Exhibit 2A to 2D for identification.

1069
01:13:16,476 --> 01:13:19,853
Photographs are tendered
to the defense for examination...

1070
01:13:19,937 --> 01:13:22,147
and the People move
their admission as evidence.

1071
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,983
- Your witness.
- Uh, no questions. No objections.

1072
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:27,444
Paul, he took pictures of me that night too.

1073
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:29,863
Just a minute, Mr. Burke.

1074
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:33,075
Uh, Mr. Burke...

1075
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:35,160
these photographs offered as evidence...

1076
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,913
are they the only photographs
you took that night?

1077
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:39,998
Why, uh, no.

1078
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:42,250
l suppose the others didn't turn out.
ls that it?

1079
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,087
All my pictures turn out!

1080
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:48,048
Oh, of course. l - l beg your pardon.

1081
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:50,842
Did you give the other pictures to the police?

1082
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,845
- Yes, sir, l did.
- Well, Mr. Burke, what were they?

1083
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:57,599
Were they side shots,
or a shot of the moon, perhaps?

1084
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,644
Or a black bear scavenging the Thunder Bay dump?

1085
01:14:00,728 --> 01:14:04,564
Your Honor, l object!
l can't see how other photographs are relevant.

1086
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:06,566
The photographs in evidence were introduced...

1087
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:09,361
to show that the deceased
met with a violent death.

1088
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:12,989
Well, Your Ηonor, l should think any photograph
pertaining to the case would be relevant.

1089
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:15,951
The point is good, Mr. Biegler. Continue.

1090
01:14:16,035 --> 01:14:18,829
What were these other
photographs of, Mr. Burke?

1091
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:21,331
Lieutenant Manion's wife.

1092
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:25,377
You mean these photographs showed how
she looked that night after Barney Quill was killed?

1093
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,547
- Yes.
- Your Honor, how she looked is irrelevant.

1094
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:32,217
No evidence has been introduced to connect
Mrs. Manion's appearance to a charge of murder.

1095
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,427
- Sustained.
- l'm sorry, Your Honor.

1096
01:14:34,512 --> 01:14:37,764
l just wanted to make sure the prosecution
wasn't withholding evidence.

1097
01:14:37,849 --> 01:14:39,766
Now look here!

1098
01:14:39,851 --> 01:14:42,894
l protest to the defense attorney's
persistent attacks...

1099
01:14:42,979 --> 01:14:45,397
on the motives of the prosecution.

1100
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:50,152
The jury will disregard the remark
made by the attorney for the defense.

1101
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:54,573
There's no reason to believe that
the prosecution has not acted in good faith.

1102
01:14:54,657 --> 01:14:57,701
My apologies to the prosecution,
and to the court.

1103
01:14:57,785 --> 01:15:01,496
But, Your Honor,
as long as protests are being made...

1104
01:15:01,581 --> 01:15:03,748
l'd like to make a protest myself.

1105
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:09,087
Now, l'm perfectly willing to take on
these two legal giants anytime, anyplace...

1106
01:15:09,172 --> 01:15:12,048
but in all fairness,
it ought to be one at a time.

1107
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:15,760
l don't want these two fellows
pitching knuckleballs at me at the same time.

1108
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:19,097
lt seems to me you're batting
close to a thousand, Mr. Biegler...

1109
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:21,808
but your point is well taken.

1110
01:15:21,893 --> 01:15:24,436
Whichever attorney opens with the witness...

1111
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:29,191
he alone shall continue with that witness
until the witness is excused.

1112
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:31,401
Thank you, Your Honor. No more questions.

1113
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,403
No questions.

1114
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:46,958
- My, we're drawing well, aren't we?
- Where's Parnell?

1115
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:49,085
Parnell? Why? lsn't he here?

1116
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:52,297
No, he's not here. He's not in his rooming house,
and he hasn't been there all night.

1117
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,299
You were the last to see him. Where is he?

1118
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,301
l promised not to tell, so don't ask me.

1119
01:15:56,385 --> 01:16:00,055
- Aw, he hasn't fallen off the wagon?
- No. Ηe was sober.

1120
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:03,975
- Ηas he gone somewhere?
- He did borrow my car for something or other.

1121
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:07,062
Your car? That was smart.
Ηe hasn't driven a car in 20 years.

1122
01:16:07,146 --> 01:16:09,189
Ηe'll kill himself. Now where's he gone?

1123
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:11,316
My word is my bond.

1124
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:38,551
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

1125
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:40,512
- Good morning.
- You may proceed.

1126
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:43,181
Your Ηonor, the, uh -

1127
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:47,018
the defense notices a third person
at the prosecution's table.

1128
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:50,313
We were wondering if the court
shares our curiosity as to just who he is.

1129
01:16:50,398 --> 01:16:52,315
l was about to introduce him.

1130
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,319
Your Ηonor, this gentleman
is Dr. W. Gregory Ηarcourt.

1131
01:16:56,404 --> 01:17:00,365
Dr. Harcourt is the People's psychiatrist
in this case.

1132
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:05,036
We ask that Dr. Harcourt
be allowed to sit at our table as an observer.

1133
01:17:05,121 --> 01:17:07,831
What are you gonna have him observe?
The constellation of Taurus...

1134
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:10,292
or the life and times of a bumblebee?

1135
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:12,294
To observe the defendant, of course.

1136
01:17:12,378 --> 01:17:14,629
Oh! Oh, well, that's fine. That's fine.

1137
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:18,508
The defense has no objection, Your Honor.
l just wish to express my relief...

1138
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:23,888
that the new recruit is not
additional legal reinforcements from Lansing.

1139
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:26,308
Call Alphonse Paquette.

1140
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:34,441
Raise your right hand, please.

1141
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:37,068
You do solemnly swear that the testimony
you shall give in this cause...

1142
01:17:37,153 --> 01:17:40,905
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1143
01:17:40,990 --> 01:17:42,907
- l do.
- Take a seat, please.

1144
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:49,164
- Will you state your name, please.
- Alphonse Paquette.

1145
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:51,875
You work at the Thunder Bay lnn,
don't you, Mr. Paquette?

1146
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:53,418
l'm bartender there.

1147
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:56,796
Were you working on the night
that Barney Quill was shot by Frederick Manion?

1148
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:59,257
- l was.
- Were you witness to the shooting?

1149
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:00,467
l was.

1150
01:18:00,551 --> 01:18:03,511
Will you tell us in your own words,
please, what happened?

1151
01:18:04,513 --> 01:18:07,932
l was at a table by the door
when Lieutenant Manion came in.

1152
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,310
Did you know Lieutenant Manion
by sight and by name?

1153
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:12,854
- Yes, sir.
- Go ahead.

1154
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,273
Well, he came in
and walked over to the bar...

1155
01:18:15,358 --> 01:18:17,692
and began to shoot.

1156
01:18:17,777 --> 01:18:21,029
Ηe shot Barney when he came up to the bar,
and when Barney fell...

1157
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:24,032
he kept on shooting down at Barney,
behind the bar.

1158
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:26,034
Then he turned around and walked out.

1159
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:30,413
When Lieutenant Manion entered the bar,
how did he appear to you?

1160
01:18:30,498 --> 01:18:32,999
Well, he walked slow.

1161
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:35,335
Kind of deliberate, l guess you could say.

1162
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:38,797
- Did he speak to Barney Quill?
- Not a word.

1163
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:42,384
Just walked over and pulled out
his gun, and bang.

1164
01:18:42,468 --> 01:18:45,637
- And then he walked out.
- Yes.

1165
01:18:45,721 --> 01:18:48,932
When he walked out, how did he appear to you?

1166
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:51,518
Ηe seemed just like he did when he walked in.

1167
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:53,812
Like he was the mailman delivering the mail.

1168
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:57,399
When Lieutenant Manion
walked out of the bar, what did you do?

1169
01:18:57,483 --> 01:19:00,652
Well, it happened so fast,
l guess l was stunned.

1170
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:03,655
- But then l ran out after him.
- Did you find him outside?

1171
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,491
- Yes, sir. He was walking away.
- Did you speak to him?

1172
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:10,829
Yes, sir. l said, uh, "Lieutenant,
you'd better not run away from this."

1173
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:13,331
Did he reply to you?

1174
01:19:13,416 --> 01:19:16,876
Ηe said, "Do you want some too, buster?"

1175
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:19,003
Was he pointing the gun at you?

1176
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:22,841
Well, he was holding the gun in my direction,
but the muzzle was low.

1177
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:26,761
When he said,
"Do you want some too, buster?"

1178
01:19:26,846 --> 01:19:28,763
how was that expressed?

1179
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:31,933
Did he shout it? Was it hysterical?

1180
01:19:32,017 --> 01:19:35,854
- Was he hoarse? Did his voice tremble?
- No, sir.

1181
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:39,190
Ηe just said it cool and hard
and looked right at me.

1182
01:19:39,275 --> 01:19:42,360
Did he appear to you,
as far as you could tell...

1183
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:45,613
to be in complete possession of his faculties?

1184
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:49,159
- Yes, sir, far as l could tell.
- Your witness.

1185
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:51,536
Mr. Paquette, did you see Laura Manion...

1186
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,872
the wife of Lieutenant Manion,
in the bar that night?

1187
01:19:53,956 --> 01:19:57,208
Your Ηonor, there he goes again.
This is immaterial and irrelevant.

1188
01:19:57,293 --> 01:20:01,212
Your Ηonor, l don't see what the prosecution's
so jumpy about. l haven't gone anyplace yet.

1189
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:05,008
Well, let's see where he's going
before we start objecting, Mr. Lodwick.

1190
01:20:05,092 --> 01:20:07,218
You may proceed, Mr. Biegler.

1191
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:10,054
Well, did you see Mrs. Manion
in the bar that night?

1192
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:14,058
- She was there.
- Did Barney Quill leave the bar that night?

1193
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,561
- Yes.
- Do you remember when he returned?

1194
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:18,563
l think he came back around midnight.

1195
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:22,108
From which entrance did he come?
Did he come from the lobby entrance...

1196
01:20:22,193 --> 01:20:24,944
or come from that -
that, uh, outside entrance?

1197
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:27,155
- lt was from the lobby.
- Mm-hmm.

1198
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:30,158
- And how did he appear to you at that time?
- Ηow do you mean?

1199
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:33,536
You understood the prosecuting attorney
very well when he asked you that question...

1200
01:20:33,621 --> 01:20:35,538
about Lieutenant Manion's appearance.

1201
01:20:35,623 --> 01:20:38,875
Oh, well, he was just old Barney, like usual.

1202
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:43,213
You mean he was just
good old sober, reliable...

1203
01:20:43,297 --> 01:20:47,091
- gentle, salt-of-the-earth, friend-to-man Barney?
- Your Honor! Your Honor!

1204
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,093
Your Ηonor, what kind of a question is that?

1205
01:20:49,178 --> 01:20:51,262
l withdraw the question, Your Honor.

1206
01:20:53,098 --> 01:20:55,016
Mr. Paquette...

1207
01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:58,770
had Barney changed his clothes
since he left the bar?

1208
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:00,063
l don't remember.

1209
01:21:00,147 --> 01:21:03,024
Might his clothing have been different
when he returned?

1210
01:21:03,108 --> 01:21:05,860
That is, might he have changed his clothes?

1211
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:07,862
l couldn't say. l didn't notice.

1212
01:21:07,947 --> 01:21:10,114
Was Barney drinking that night?

1213
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:14,619
Well, he - he always had a few shots
while he was talking to the customers.

1214
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:18,081
- He was friendly.
- Oh, sure he was. Sure. Good old Barney.

1215
01:21:18,165 --> 01:21:21,918
Well, now, how many shots would you say
good old Barney usually had?

1216
01:21:22,002 --> 01:21:23,294
l don't know exactly.

1217
01:21:23,379 --> 01:21:26,214
Wasn't he, in fact,
pretty loaded that night, Mr. Paquette?

1218
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:27,799
Objection, Your Honor.

1219
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:31,553
Even if the deceased was dead drunk,
it's no defense to this charge.

1220
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:34,931
Sustained.
l suggest you get off this, Mr. Biegler.

1221
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:40,603
Mr. Paquette, what would you call a man
with an insatiable penchant for women?

1222
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:43,523
- A what?
- A penchant.

1223
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:46,150
A desire, uh, taste, passion.

1224
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:49,404
Well, a ladies' man, l guess.

1225
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:52,073
Or maybe just a damn fool.

1226
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:56,286
Just answer the questions, Mr. Paquette.

1227
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,913
The attorneys will provide the wisecracks.

1228
01:21:58,998 --> 01:22:02,917
Well -  What else would you call
a man like that, Mr. Paquette?

1229
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:05,169
We can't see the drift of this, Your Honor.

1230
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:07,338
You mean you do see, Mr. Lodwick.

1231
01:22:07,423 --> 01:22:11,092
- You may answer.
- Can you think of another name, Mr. Paquette?

1232
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:13,928
- Woman chaser.
- Try again.

1233
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:17,640
- Masher?
- Oh, now, come now, Mr. Paquette.

1234
01:22:17,725 --> 01:22:20,810
Mashers went out with
whalebone corsets and hairnets.

1235
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:23,187
Did you ever hear the expression "wolf"?

1236
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,982
Well, sure, l heard that.
lt just slipped my mind.

1237
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:28,151
lt slipped your mind. Well, naturally it would.

1238
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:31,237
- Clanking around in there
with all those rusty old mashers.

1239
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:35,366
- Have you ever known a man
who you could call a wolf, Mr. Paquette?
- l'm not sure.

1240
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:38,119
- Was Barney Quill a wolf, Mr. Paquette?
- l couldn't say.

1241
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:40,038
- Or wouldn't?
- Objection.

1242
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:44,292
Sustained. The question was answered.
He said he couldn't say.

1243
01:22:45,169 --> 01:22:50,214
Mr. Paquette, when Barney returned
from wherever he had gone...

1244
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:52,550
- did he relieve you at the bar?
- Yes.

1245
01:22:52,635 --> 01:22:55,720
- And what did he say to you when he relieved you?
- Said, "l'll take over."

1246
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:58,264
When you came out from behind the bar,
where did you go?

1247
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:02,143
l went over to the table
where the Pedersons were sitting.

1248
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:06,064
Now, you testified that you were by the door
when Lieutenant Manion came in.

1249
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:09,233
ls that the reason you were by the door,
because the Pedersons' table was there?

1250
01:23:09,318 --> 01:23:10,818
- Yes.
- Uh-huh.

1251
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:13,821
And how long was it before
Lieutenant Manion came in?

1252
01:23:14,657 --> 01:23:17,825
l don't know exactly.
Uh, maybe 30 minutes.

1253
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:20,453
And you remained
at the Pedersons' table all that time.

1254
01:23:20,537 --> 01:23:24,957
- Yes, they're friends of mine.
- ls there also a window beside that table?

1255
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:26,959
- l think so.
- You think so.

1256
01:23:27,044 --> 01:23:30,338
Ηow long have you worked
at the Thunder Bay lnn, Mr. Paquette?

1257
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:34,342
- About six or seven years.
- Well, now, does this window beside the table -

1258
01:23:34,426 --> 01:23:37,929
does it suddenly vanish and then reappear...

1259
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:39,931
and come and go in a ghostly fashion?

1260
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,933
No, sir. lt's there all the time.

1261
01:23:42,017 --> 01:23:45,770
And while you were talking to your friends there,
did you happen to look out of the window?

1262
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:48,022
- l might have.
- And when you looked out of the window...

1263
01:23:48,107 --> 01:23:50,066
were you looking for something special?

1264
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:52,110
No. No, l wasn't looking for anything.

1265
01:23:52,194 --> 01:23:54,445
Didn't Barney Quill tell you
to go over to that window...

1266
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,656
and watch out for Lieutenant Manion?

1267
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:02,662
Did he tell you to look out
for Lieutenant Manion?

1268
01:24:03,205 --> 01:24:05,206
Ηe did not.

1269
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:09,585
Mr. Paquette,
Barney was quite a marksman, wasn't he?

1270
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:12,547
With guns. He'd won a lot of prizes
for shooting, hadn't he?

1271
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:16,134
- Yes.
- Did he keep any guns behind the bar?

1272
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:24,100
Well, he might have.

1273
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:28,104
lsn't it a fact that there are three concealed
pistol racks behind the bar, Mr. Paquette?

1274
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:31,983
Your Honor, the defendant's plea
is one of insanity, not self-defense.

1275
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:35,987
l'm sure Mr. Biegler
hasn't forgotten that fact, Mr. Lodwick.

1276
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:40,158
- You may answer.
- Are there concealed gun racks behind the bar?

1277
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:41,242
Yes.

1278
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:44,537
And how many people
know about these gun racks?

1279
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:47,749
- l couldn't say.
- But isn't it a fact that Barney,
every once in a while...

1280
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:50,668
he'd take the guns out of these racks,
and twirling them on his fingers...

1281
01:24:50,753 --> 01:24:53,671
he'd demonstrate his skill to the patrons?

1282
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:55,631
- lsn't it?
- l don't remember.

1283
01:24:55,716 --> 01:24:57,967
Oh, now, come on. Try and remember.

1284
01:24:58,051 --> 01:25:01,804
- Did you ever see him do that yourself?
- Once or twice he did.

1285
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:05,391
- That's all, Mr. Paquette.
- No further questions.

1286
01:25:05,476 --> 01:25:09,103
- The witness may step down.
- Call George Lemon.

1287
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,612
Biegler's going off in all directions.

1288
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,614
What's he getting at?

1289
01:25:20,783 --> 01:25:22,575
Raise your right hand, please.

1290
01:25:22,659 --> 01:25:26,496
- l have a feeling he's afraid of what we'll get at.
- ...shall be the truth -

1291
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:29,457
Mr. Biegler's putting up
a smoke screen for some reason.

1292
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:31,793
- l do.
- Take a seat, please.

1293
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:37,256
- Will you state your name, please?
- George Lemon.

1294
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:39,217
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Lemon?

1295
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:42,553
l'm caretaker of the tourist park
in Thunder Bay.

1296
01:25:42,638 --> 01:25:44,555
l see the place is clean and orderly.

1297
01:25:44,640 --> 01:25:47,141
l check people in,
check 'em out and lock the gate at night.

1298
01:25:47,226 --> 01:25:50,520
And what is your authority for these duties?

1299
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:55,900
l'm paid by Mastodon township, and l'm also
a deputy sheriff - just courtesy, sort of.

1300
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:59,403
Did you see Lieutenant Manion
on the night of the 1 5th?

1301
01:25:59,488 --> 01:26:02,406
- The night Barney Quill was killed?
- Yes, sir.

1302
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:05,284
Will you tell the court...

1303
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:10,414
about how and-and when
you saw Lieutenant Manion?

1304
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:13,543
00 a.m.,
a knock on my door waked me up.

1305
01:26:13,627 --> 01:26:16,254
l went to the door,
and Lieutenant Manion was standing there.

1306
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:21,175
Ηe said, "You better take me, Mr. Lemon,
because l just shot Barney Quill."

1307
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:24,512
l told him to go back to his trailer
and that l would call the state police.

1308
01:26:24,596 --> 01:26:28,432
Ηow did Lieutenant Manion
appear to you when he asked you to take him?

1309
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:32,186
Ηe said what he had to say
and did what l told him. There wasn't any fuss.

1310
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:35,356
Did he appear to you to be,
as far as you could tell...

1311
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:38,109
in complete possession of his faculties?

1312
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:40,361
As far as l could tell, yes, sir.

1313
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,948
Take the witness.

1314
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:47,451
Mr. Lemon,
did you go to the Manions' trailer?

1315
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:48,578
Yes, sir.

1316
01:26:48,662 --> 01:26:50,580
Did you see Mrs. Manion at the trailer?

1317
01:26:50,664 --> 01:26:53,624
- Yes, sir.
- What was her appearance?

1318
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,836
She was a mess.

1319
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:59,130
Objection.
No evidence has been introduced...

1320
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:02,133
to make Mrs. Manion's appearance
relevant to this case.

1321
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:05,761
Well, no evidence has been introduced
to make Barney Quill's appearance relevant...

1322
01:27:05,846 --> 01:27:07,930
but you didn't object to the question then.

1323
01:27:08,015 --> 01:27:11,767
ls that because you know that Barney Quill
bathed and changed and cooled off...

1324
01:27:11,852 --> 01:27:14,395
after he raped and beat hell
out of this poor woman?

1325
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:17,857
Your Ηonor, everybody in this court
is being tried except Frederick Manion!

1326
01:27:17,983 --> 01:27:21,152
- l must protest -
- Now listen! This is a cross-examination
in a murder case!

1327
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:24,238
lt's not a high school debate!
What are you and Dancer trying to do?

1328
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:26,657
Railroad this soldier into the clink?

1329
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:29,410
Mr. Biegler,
you are an experienced attorney...

1330
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:32,246
and you know better
than to make such an outburst.

1331
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:35,207
l will not tolerate intemperance of this sort.

1332
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:38,544
lf you once again try
the patience of this court...

1333
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:41,047
l shall hold you in contempt.

1334
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:43,674
Sorry.

1335
01:27:44,468 --> 01:27:46,344
Your Ηonor...

1336
01:27:46,428 --> 01:27:50,014
l apologize,
and it won't happen again.

1337
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:54,810
The witness's answer will be stricken,
and the jury will disregard the answer.

1338
01:27:55,354 --> 01:27:59,106
- Now you may proceed, Mr. Biegler.
- Yes, sir.

1339
01:27:59,983 --> 01:28:01,943
Mr. Lemon...

1340
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:05,279
on the night when Lieutenant Manion
awakened you and turned himself in...

1341
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:07,281
had you been awakened before?

1342
01:28:07,366 --> 01:28:10,368
- Had anything else disturbed your slumbers?
- No, sir.

1343
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:14,872
- There were no soldiers singing?
- No, sir. Not in my park after 1 0:00.

1344
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:19,126
- There were no women screaming?
- Well, those screams were down by the gate.

1345
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:20,836
Objection! Objection!

1346
01:28:20,921 --> 01:28:23,923
l see no reason for objecting yet,
Mr. Lodwick.

1347
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:27,176
Tell us about those screams, Mr. Lemon.

1348
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:30,721
l didn't hear 'em myself.
There were some tourists from Ohio in the park...

1349
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:33,140
and they heard 'em
and told me about it the next day.

1350
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:37,269
- Now, Mr. Lodwick.
- This testimony is incompetent, hearsay...

1351
01:28:37,354 --> 01:28:40,314
irrelevant, immaterial, inconclusive -

1352
01:28:40,399 --> 01:28:42,817
Yeah, well, that's too much for me.

1353
01:28:42,901 --> 01:28:45,319
- The witness is yours, Mr. Lodwick.
- Ηuh?

1354
01:28:45,404 --> 01:28:48,155
Oh, uh, uh, no questions.

1355
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:50,866
The witness may step down.

1356
01:28:50,951 --> 01:28:53,661
- Call your next witness.
- Um -

1357
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:57,081
Detective Sergeant James Durgo.

1358
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:01,168
- Hi, Polly.
- Ηi, Jim. Come here.

1359
01:29:03,213 --> 01:29:06,007
As soon as we break,
you'd better phone that army psychiatrist.

1360
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:08,926
- Tell him to be here day after tomorrow.
- Will do.

1361
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:12,263
Will you please tell me
where Parnell has gone?

1362
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,265
Won't do.

1363
01:29:14,349 --> 01:29:15,975
You're fired.

1364
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:19,395
You can't fire me till you pay me.

1365
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:21,772
Detective Sergeant James Durgo, state police.

1366
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:24,775
Were you called to Thunder Bay
by Deputy Sheriff Lemon of Thunder Bay...

1367
01:29:24,860 --> 01:29:27,194
on the night that Barney Quill
was shot and killed?

1368
01:29:27,279 --> 01:29:31,282
Yes, sir, l was. My companion officer and l
were the first to be called in on the case.

1369
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:34,952
Sergeant Durgo, when you arrived
at the Manion trailer, who was there?

1370
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:37,371
Lieutenant Manion and his wife were there.

1371
01:29:37,456 --> 01:29:39,707
What did Lieutenant Manion say to you?

1372
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:44,128
Ηe said that his wife
had had some trouble with Barney Quill -

1373
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:46,922
that he had gone to the tavern
and shot Quill.

1374
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:50,342
Ηe asked us whether Quill was dead or not.
We told him he was.

1375
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:53,429
Ηow did Lieutenant Manion
take this information?

1376
01:29:53,513 --> 01:29:57,183
- He didn't seem surprised.
- What did you do then, Sergeant Durgo?

1377
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:59,185
l asked for the gun he'd used.

1378
01:29:59,269 --> 01:30:03,397
Did you take Lieutenant Manion to the county jail
here in lron City on that same night?

1379
01:30:03,482 --> 01:30:06,275
Yes, sir. We drove the lieutenant
down with his wife.

1380
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:11,322
On the drive to lron City, did the lieutenant
talk further about the shooting?

1381
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:15,159
Ηe remarked that if he had the whole thing
to do over again, he'd still do it.

1382
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:18,996
During all this -
at the trailer, the drive to lron City -

1383
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:20,956
how did Lieutenant Manion appear to you?

1384
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:25,586
Ηe was very quiet most of the time.
Seemed clearheaded.

1385
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:29,965
As far as you could tell, would you say that
he was in complete possession of his faculties?

1386
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:32,760
- Seemed so to me.
- Your witness.

1387
01:30:32,844 --> 01:30:37,640
Sergeant Durgo, you testified that Lieutenant
Manion told you that he shot Barney Quill...

1388
01:30:37,724 --> 01:30:42,061
after he learned that his wife
had had some trouble with Quill.

1389
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:45,606
Now, were these the words
Lieutenant Manion used? "Some trouble"?

1390
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:48,025
No, sir. Those were my words, not his.

1391
01:30:48,110 --> 01:30:51,028
And was it your notion
to come here and use your own words?

1392
01:30:51,113 --> 01:30:53,030
No, sir. lt was not.

1393
01:30:53,115 --> 01:30:58,369
And was the suggestion to call it "some trouble"
made by somebody here in this courtroom?

1394
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,540
Yes, sir, it was.

1395
01:31:02,624 --> 01:31:04,875
All right, Sergeant.
Now, would you tell the court...

1396
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,336
what words Lieutenant Manion actually used...

1397
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:09,630
to describe the trouble his wife had had?

1398
01:31:09,714 --> 01:31:12,383
Objection, Your Ηonor.
We've been over this before.

1399
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:15,553
This information would not be relevant
to any issues before the court.

1400
01:31:15,637 --> 01:31:17,555
This statement concerning some trouble...

1401
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:21,350
was brought out during
the direct examination of Sergeant Durgo.

1402
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:26,730
Up to now you've adroitly restricted
all testimony as far as Laura Manion's concerned.

1403
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:30,317
All right. The cat's out of the bag.
lt's fair game for me to chase it.

1404
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:33,487
This is a sore point, Mr. Biegler,
and it's getting sorer.

1405
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:35,489
l'd like to hear from the prosecution.

1406
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:40,536
The burden is on the defense to prove
temporary insanity at the time of the shooting.

1407
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:44,790
Now, if the reason for the alleged insanity
is important to this case...

1408
01:31:44,875 --> 01:31:47,418
then that is a matter
for a competent witness...

1409
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:50,296
an expert on the subject of the human mind.

1410
01:31:51,339 --> 01:31:53,841
What the defense is trying to do...

1411
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:56,760
is introduce some sensational material...

1412
01:31:56,845 --> 01:31:59,513
for the purposes of obscuring the real issues.

1413
01:32:00,974 --> 01:32:05,603
Your Ηonor, how can the jury accurately
estimate the testimony being given here...

1414
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:09,148
unless they first know
the reason behind this whole trial -

1415
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:12,109
why Lieutenant Manion shot Barney Quill.

1416
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:16,280
Now, the prosecution would like to separate
the motive from the act.

1417
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:21,285
Well, that's like trying to take the core
from an apple without breaking the skin.

1418
01:32:21,369 --> 01:32:26,290
The core of our defense
is that the defendant's temporary insanity...

1419
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:29,668
was triggered by
this so-called trouble with Quill.

1420
01:32:29,753 --> 01:32:31,879
And l beg the court -

1421
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:36,467
l beg the court
to let me cut into the apple.

1422
01:32:38,386 --> 01:32:40,763
Our objection still stands, Your Ηonor.

1423
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:57,154
Objection overruled.

1424
01:33:03,703 --> 01:33:07,331
Sergeant Durgo, tell the court...

1425
01:33:07,415 --> 01:33:11,460
how Lieutenant Manion described
the trouble his wife had with Barney Quill.

1426
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:14,964
Ηe told us that Quill had raped his wife.

1427
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:19,468
Now, can you recall generally what
Lieutenant Manion told you about this rape?

1428
01:33:20,053 --> 01:33:24,223
Yes, sir. He said he'd been asleep
since right after dinner.

1429
01:33:24,307 --> 01:33:28,394
That he was waked up by some noise.
Screams, he thought.

1430
01:33:28,478 --> 01:33:32,064
That he got up, opened the trailer door
and went outside.

1431
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:35,693
His wife came running
out of the dark and fell into his arms.

1432
01:33:35,777 --> 01:33:39,029
You saw his wife in the trailer.
How'd she look?

1433
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:42,199
She was a little hysterical.
She'd been pretty badly beaten up.

1434
01:33:42,284 --> 01:33:45,077
She had big black bruises
over her face and her arms.

1435
01:33:45,161 --> 01:33:48,998
- Did Mrs. Manion tell you
about this rape and beating?
- She did.

1436
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:52,668
- And did she take you
to the place where it had happened?
- Yes, sir. The next morning.

1437
01:33:52,752 --> 01:33:56,213
And did you find anything there?
Any sort of evidence pertaining to the story...

1438
01:33:56,298 --> 01:33:58,716
that Mrs. Manion had told you?

1439
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:03,554
On the lane in the woods we found
some tire tracks and some dog tracks...

1440
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:07,349
and a leather case with some
horn-rimmed glasses inside.

1441
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:10,477
We also looked for...

1442
01:34:10,562 --> 01:34:14,189
a certain undergarment of Mrs. Manion's,
but we didn't find it.

1443
01:34:14,274 --> 01:34:17,067
Will the attorneys for both sides
approach the bench, please?

1444
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:25,159
Mr. Biegler,
you finally got your rape into the case...

1445
01:34:25,243 --> 01:34:29,079
and l think all the details
should now be made clear to the jury.

1446
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:33,083
- Do you agree, Mr. Lodwick?
- Absolutely.

1447
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:36,545
What exactly was
the undergarment just referred to?

1448
01:34:36,629 --> 01:34:38,339
Panties, Your Honor.

1449
01:34:38,423 --> 01:34:42,134
- Do you expect this subject to come up again?
- Yes, sir.

1450
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:46,555
There's a certain light connotation
attached to the word "panties."

1451
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:48,682
Can we find another name for them?

1452
01:34:48,767 --> 01:34:52,728
- l never heard my wife call 'em anything else.
- Mr. Biegler?

1453
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:57,608
- l'm a bachelor, Your Ηonor.
- That's a great help. Mr. Dancer?

1454
01:34:57,692 --> 01:35:02,529
When l was overseas during the war,
Your Ηonor, l - l learned a French word.

1455
01:35:02,614 --> 01:35:06,992
- l'm afraid that it might be slightly suggestive.
- Most French words are.

1456
01:35:07,077 --> 01:35:10,120
All right, gentlemen. Back to your places.

1457
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:15,501
For the benefit of the jury,
but more especially for the spectators...

1458
01:35:15,585 --> 01:35:19,380
the undergarment referred to
in the testimony was, to be exact...

1459
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:21,382
Mrs. Manion's panties.

1460
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:29,306
l wanted you to get your snickering
over and done with.

1461
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:33,644
This pair of panties will be mentioned again
in the course of this trial...

1462
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:36,230
and when it happens,
there will not be one laugh...

1463
01:35:36,314 --> 01:35:38,232
one snicker, one giggle...

1464
01:35:38,316 --> 01:35:41,443
or even one smirk in my courtroom.

1465
01:35:41,528 --> 01:35:45,155
There isn't anything comic
about a pair of panties...

1466
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:48,659
which figure in the violent death
of one man...

1467
01:35:48,743 --> 01:35:52,329
and the possible incarceration of another.

1468
01:35:52,872 --> 01:35:54,915
Proceed, Mr. Biegler.

1469
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:57,668
- Did you give Mrs. Manion a lie detector test?
- Objection.

1470
01:35:57,752 --> 01:36:00,546
A polygraph test is inadmissible evidence
in our courts.

1471
01:36:00,630 --> 01:36:04,049
l only asked if he gave the test.
l didn't ask the results.

1472
01:36:04,134 --> 01:36:06,135
Ηe may answer that.

1473
01:36:06,219 --> 01:36:09,221
l gave her a lie detector test at her request.

1474
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:13,600
- After all this investigation,
did you believe Mrs. Manion?
- l did.

1475
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:17,062
- Even after the lie detector test?
- Your Ηonor, l object to that question!

1476
01:36:17,147 --> 01:36:21,233
lt constitutes flagrant, sneaking subterfuge
on the part of the defense counsel.

1477
01:36:21,317 --> 01:36:25,028
Objection sustained.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury...

1478
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:28,991
a polygraph or lie detector test
is not admissible in evidence...

1479
01:36:29,075 --> 01:36:31,452
because no one has ever been quite sure...

1480
01:36:31,536 --> 01:36:35,497
that some people couldn't lie
to a lie detector and get away with it.

1481
01:36:35,582 --> 01:36:39,668
- Go ahead, Mr. Biegler.
- ln any case, Sergeant Durgo, you, yourself...

1482
01:36:39,752 --> 01:36:44,089
in your own heart and mind
are quite convinced of Mrs. Manion's honesty.

1483
01:36:44,174 --> 01:36:46,592
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.

1484
01:36:48,094 --> 01:36:50,095
Just a moment.

1485
01:36:50,180 --> 01:36:51,680
Yes, of course.

1486
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:58,228
Sergeant Durgo, did you look for the panties
elsewhere than the lane in the woods?

1487
01:36:58,313 --> 01:37:01,148
We looked in Barney Quill's car
and his room in the hotel.

1488
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:03,192
We didn't find the panties.

1489
01:37:03,276 --> 01:37:06,695
Do you know why Mrs. Manion
requested a lie detector test?

1490
01:37:06,779 --> 01:37:08,864
- l know what she said.
- What was that?

1491
01:37:08,948 --> 01:37:10,908
She said she wanted everybody
to believe her story...

1492
01:37:10,992 --> 01:37:12,910
because she knew it would
help her husband.

1493
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:14,578
Was that the only reason she gave?

1494
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:18,832
She said she'd already sworn to her husband.
She wanted everybody else to believe it too.

1495
01:37:18,917 --> 01:37:21,084
One moment, please, Your Honor.

1496
01:37:24,714 --> 01:37:27,341
Ask him in what manner she swore.

1497
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:30,677
Did Mrs. Manion say how
she had sworn to her husband?

1498
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:34,389
Yes, sir. She said she'd sworn on a rosary.

1499
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:39,186
Sergeant, this lane in the woods -
What's it used for? Where does it go?

1500
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:42,856
Used to be a logging road.
Doesn't go anyplace. Just stops.

1501
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:44,858
Who uses it now?

1502
01:37:44,943 --> 01:37:48,779
- l think it's a road kids drive down to park.
- You mean it's a lovers' lane.

1503
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:51,448
- l think so. Yes, sir.
- The witness is yours, Mr. Biegler.

1504
01:37:51,533 --> 01:37:54,451
- No more questions.
- The witness may step down.

1505
01:37:54,536 --> 01:37:58,705
ln view of the evidence concerning rape
which Your Ηonor has ruled admissible...

1506
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:02,084
the prosecution asks for a 30-minute recess
in order that we may bring in...

1507
01:38:02,168 --> 01:38:04,294
another witness whom
we had not anticipated using.

1508
01:38:04,379 --> 01:38:08,215
- All right. We'll take a 30-minute recess.
- Recess.

1509
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:17,766
Why didn't you tell me about that rosary?

1510
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:21,144
We forgot it.

1511
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:25,357
We didn't forget it.
Manny said maybe we shouldn't tell that again.

1512
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:29,903
lt might have looked like something else.
Like l-l didn't believe her.

1513
01:38:31,322 --> 01:38:33,240
Ηow much more didn't you tell me?

1514
01:38:33,324 --> 01:38:36,493
Everything else.
We told you everything else.

1515
01:38:36,578 --> 01:38:38,495
ls that right, Laura?

1516
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:40,664
Oh, yes. Everything else.

1517
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:43,000
All right. Now get this, both of ya.

1518
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:46,295
When you get up on that stand,
l want you to tell the truth.

1519
01:38:47,005 --> 01:38:49,339
l don't want you to tell
anything but the truth.

1520
01:38:49,424 --> 01:38:54,636
Don't try and lie. Don't try and conceal anything,
or you'll get skinned alive.

1521
01:38:54,721 --> 01:38:56,888
This fellow Dancer's gonna move in.

1522
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:21,371
Dr. Dompierre, did you have
occasion to come to the county jail...

1523
01:39:21,456 --> 01:39:23,915
on the night of August the 1 5th of this year?

1524
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,543
- l did.
- Who called you to the jail?

1525
01:39:26,628 --> 01:39:30,088
- The police authorities.
- What did they want you to do?

1526
01:39:30,173 --> 01:39:32,966
They wanted me to make a test
for the presence of sperm...

1527
01:39:33,051 --> 01:39:35,719
on the person of a Mrs. Frederick Manion.

1528
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:39,556
- l made the test.
- ln making this test, what was your conclusion?

1529
01:39:39,641 --> 01:39:42,934
- Negative. There was none.
- Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

1530
01:39:44,145 --> 01:39:46,063
Doctor, in making these tests...

1531
01:39:46,147 --> 01:39:48,899
did you notice any bruises or marks
on Mrs. Manion at that time?

1532
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:50,192
l did.

1533
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:52,611
Were you asked to determine the reason
for these bruises?

1534
01:39:52,695 --> 01:39:54,196
l was not.

1535
01:39:54,280 --> 01:39:57,199
Where did you do the laboratory work
on your test for sperm?

1536
01:39:57,283 --> 01:39:59,576
Saint Margaret's hospital in this city.

1537
01:39:59,661 --> 01:40:03,747
- Who worked up the slides for you?
- A technician at the hospital.

1538
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:07,250
Well, wouldn't it have been better
to have these slides worked up...

1539
01:40:07,335 --> 01:40:10,045
by a pathologist or an expert in this field?

1540
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:12,631
Well, yes, but the police were in a hurry...

1541
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:15,759
and l happened to know this young fella
came on at 7:00 in the morning.

1542
01:40:15,843 --> 01:40:18,553
Wouldn't it have been especially better
to wait for the expert...

1543
01:40:18,638 --> 01:40:21,431
if the possible question of rape
hung on the result?

1544
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:24,059
- lt would have been.
- Now, Doctor, in the newspaper...

1545
01:40:24,143 --> 01:40:28,063
on the evening of August the 1 6th,
it was stated that you found no evidence of rape.

1546
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:31,525
- ls that true?
- lt is not true. l made no such statement.

1547
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:35,445
But did you form an opinion
as to whether Mrs. Manion had been raped?

1548
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:37,781
- No.
- Why didn't you form an opinion?

1549
01:40:37,865 --> 01:40:42,119
lt's impossible to tell
if a mature, married woman has been raped.

1550
01:40:42,203 --> 01:40:44,663
- That's all.
- Doctor...

1551
01:40:44,747 --> 01:40:48,417
did you have an opinion about whether or not
she'd had any recent relations with a man?

1552
01:40:48,501 --> 01:40:51,211
lnsofar as no sperm was present...

1553
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:54,256
it didn't appear that she had
had recent relations with a man.

1554
01:40:54,340 --> 01:40:57,008
- That's all.
- Just one more question, Doctor.

1555
01:40:57,093 --> 01:40:59,302
The fact that no evidence
was present in her body...

1556
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:01,638
does not mean that
she was not raped, does it?

1557
01:41:01,723 --> 01:41:03,223
No.

1558
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:05,809
Do you know what constitutes rape
under the law?

1559
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:07,352
Yes, sir.

1560
01:41:07,437 --> 01:41:09,646
Violation is sufficient for rape.

1561
01:41:09,731 --> 01:41:11,732
There need not be a completion.

1562
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:14,484
- No further questions.
- The witness may step down.

1563
01:41:14,569 --> 01:41:17,738
The People recall
Alphonse Paquette to the stand.

1564
01:41:17,822 --> 01:41:21,783
Your Ηonor, since counsel for the defense
has forced the question of rape...

1565
01:41:21,868 --> 01:41:25,078
it becomes necessary to take
this additional testimony from Mr. Paquette.

1566
01:41:25,163 --> 01:41:27,456
You're still under oath, Mr. Paquette.

1567
01:41:27,957 --> 01:41:29,541
Mr. Paquette...

1568
01:41:31,252 --> 01:41:34,421
would you take a look at Mrs. Manion,
seated there behind the defense table?

1569
01:41:34,505 --> 01:41:36,673
Was she dressed in this manner
on the night of the shooting?

1570
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:38,592
- No.
- How was she dressed?

1571
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:42,262
She had on a real tight skirt
and sweater kind of thing.

1572
01:41:42,346 --> 01:41:46,808
Sort of glued on. She was wearing
a pair of red shoes with high heels.

1573
01:41:46,893 --> 01:41:50,312
- Was she wearing hose?
- No. She was bare legged.

1574
01:41:50,396 --> 01:41:52,898
- Was she wearing a hat?
- No.

1575
01:41:52,982 --> 01:41:57,110
Um, Mr. Paquette, what kind of hair
does Mrs. Manion have under that hat?

1576
01:41:57,195 --> 01:42:00,489
Well, we'd be very happy
to show the court Mrs. Manion's hair.

1577
01:42:00,573 --> 01:42:04,034
Mrs. Manion, would you take off
your hat, please?

1578
01:42:08,581 --> 01:42:10,665
Thank you, Mr. Biegler.

1579
01:42:11,292 --> 01:42:14,336
Mr. Paquette, was she wearing
glasses that night?

1580
01:42:14,962 --> 01:42:17,088
l think she was when she played pinball.

1581
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:21,927
Considering the tight skirt
and the tight sweater and the bare legs...

1582
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:24,721
- what was the result in her appearance?
- Well -

1583
01:42:24,806 --> 01:42:29,392
Would you say that Mrs. Manion's appearance
was deliberately voluptuous and enticing?

1584
01:42:29,477 --> 01:42:31,394
You could pretty much
see everything she had.

1585
01:42:31,479 --> 01:42:35,190
Your Honor, the defense will concede
that Mrs. Manion, when dressed informally...

1586
01:42:35,274 --> 01:42:37,734
is an astonishingly beautiful woman.

1587
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:40,654
And we - Well, Mrs. Manion,
stand up, please. Will you?

1588
01:42:40,738 --> 01:42:42,739
As a matter of fact - Take your glasses off.

1589
01:42:42,824 --> 01:42:45,242
As a matter of fact,
it's pretty easy to understand...

1590
01:42:45,326 --> 01:42:47,494
why her husband
became temporarily deranged...

1591
01:42:47,578 --> 01:42:50,914
when he saw such beauty
bruised and torn by a beast.

1592
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:53,250
Your Ηonor, l protest.

1593
01:42:53,334 --> 01:42:55,335
Mr. Biegler is perhaps the least disciplined...

1594
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:58,839
and the most completely out-of-order attorney
l've ever seen in a courtroom.

1595
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:01,716
The jury will ignore Mr. Biegler's oration.

1596
01:43:04,095 --> 01:43:08,014
Uh, was Mrs. Manion drinking
heavily that night?

1597
01:43:08,683 --> 01:43:12,602
l sold her six drinks myself, and then Barney
came over and got some more for her.

1598
01:43:12,687 --> 01:43:15,522
- l don't remember how many.
- Would you say that she was tight?

1599
01:43:15,606 --> 01:43:18,775
- Oh, she was high, all right.
- What did she do to make you think she was high?

1600
01:43:18,860 --> 01:43:21,987
Well, she took off
her shoes and went barefooted, and...

1601
01:43:22,071 --> 01:43:26,116
when she played pinball she'd kind of
swish around to give the machine English.

1602
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:30,787
- You mean she was flipping her hips around.
- Yeah.

1603
01:43:30,872 --> 01:43:32,789
Anything else?

1604
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:36,960
Well, when she made a good score, she jumped
up and down and squealed like women do.

1605
01:43:37,044 --> 01:43:40,755
She was playing pinball
with Barney Quill that night, wasn't she?

1606
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:43,133
- Yes, sir.
- What was her attitude toward Barney Quill?

1607
01:43:43,217 --> 01:43:45,135
Friendly, l guess you could call it.

1608
01:43:45,219 --> 01:43:47,137
- More than friendly, would you say?
- l thought so.

1609
01:43:47,221 --> 01:43:49,222
Why did you think so?

1610
01:43:50,099 --> 01:43:55,061
Well, she - she'd kind of lean on him, and
a couple of times she bumped him with her hip.

1611
01:43:56,689 --> 01:44:00,817
Uh, would you say that Mrs. Manion
was making a play for Barney Quill?

1612
01:44:01,402 --> 01:44:04,654
Objection. That calls for an assumption
on the part of the witness, Your Ηonor.

1613
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:07,032
l withdraw the question.
Would you say that, uh...

1614
01:44:07,116 --> 01:44:09,826
Mrs. Manion was free and easy
with Barney Quill?

1615
01:44:09,911 --> 01:44:12,078
- l would.
- Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

1616
01:44:12,163 --> 01:44:15,373
Mr. Paquette,
the attorney for the People asked you...

1617
01:44:15,458 --> 01:44:20,128
if Mrs. Manion was tight,
and you said that she was high.

1618
01:44:20,212 --> 01:44:24,257
Now, speaking as a bartender,
what's the distinction between the two?

1619
01:44:24,342 --> 01:44:27,302
- l don't think l understand.
- Well, l mean...

1620
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:31,681
when we say a person's tight, we usually mean
that they're a little stupid with the drink.

1621
01:44:31,766 --> 01:44:34,768
- lsn't that so?
- l guess that's about it. Yes.

1622
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:38,104
And if they're high,
they're gay and enjoying themselves.

1623
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:41,358
- Yes.
- ln other words, Mrs. Manion was happy.

1624
01:44:41,442 --> 01:44:44,444
Well, now, is there anything wrong
with being happy in Thunder Bay lnn?

1625
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:48,406
- No.
- Thunder Bay itself is a resort, isn't it?

1626
01:44:48,491 --> 01:44:51,576
- Swimming, fishing, that sort of thing?
- Yes.

1627
01:44:51,661 --> 01:44:55,080
ls there anything unusual about
seeing a barefooted woman in Thunder Bay?

1628
01:44:55,164 --> 01:44:58,708
- No.
- So Mrs. Manion's taking her
shoes off in Thunder Bay...

1629
01:44:58,793 --> 01:45:01,711
that doesn't necessarily mean
that she was being unladylike, does it?

1630
01:45:01,796 --> 01:45:03,713
- l guess not.
- Yes or no?

1631
01:45:03,798 --> 01:45:05,298
No!

1632
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:09,719
Now, you testified...

1633
01:45:09,804 --> 01:45:14,057
that Mrs. Manion was squealing
and jumping up and down and -

1634
01:45:15,017 --> 01:45:17,769
and swishing her -
l think that was the expression you used -

1635
01:45:17,853 --> 01:45:19,938
swishing her hips
around the pinball machine.

1636
01:45:20,022 --> 01:45:23,525
Now, was she creating a disturbance?
Was she attracting a crowd?

1637
01:45:23,609 --> 01:45:25,527
- No.
- Were all the men at the bar -

1638
01:45:25,611 --> 01:45:27,529
Were they all standing around
watching Mrs. Manion?

1639
01:45:27,613 --> 01:45:29,781
- No.
- But you were very conscious of Mrs. Manion.

1640
01:45:29,865 --> 01:45:32,784
You were conscious enough
so that you can tell us all about her actions.

1641
01:45:32,868 --> 01:45:35,620
- Yes.
- And certainly Barney Quill,
he was conscious of Mrs. Manion...

1642
01:45:35,705 --> 01:45:38,581
because he was playing pinball
with Mrs. Manion, wouldn't you say so?

1643
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:41,960
- Yes.
- So it seems that only you and Barney Quill...

1644
01:45:42,044 --> 01:45:46,089
were acutely aware of Mrs. Manion
and her actions and her appearance.

1645
01:45:46,173 --> 01:45:48,967
And maybe good old Barney,
when he came up to get some drinks from you...

1646
01:45:49,051 --> 01:45:53,722
maybe he winked and said, "Alphonse,
l'm gonna take this babe out and rape her."

1647
01:45:53,806 --> 01:45:57,308
- No! No, he didn't.
- Yeah, and maybe you said,
"Do it once for me, boss!"

1648
01:45:57,393 --> 01:46:00,437
Objection, objection.
Those are not questions. Counsel is attacking -

1649
01:46:00,521 --> 01:46:02,689
No more questions!

1650
01:46:02,773 --> 01:46:06,776
The court's had about all of this dogfight
it can take for one day...

1651
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:10,363
and l'm sure the jury
is equally tired and hungry.

1652
01:46:10,448 --> 01:46:14,242
Tomorrow the defense takes over,
and with expedition, prayer...

1653
01:46:14,326 --> 01:46:16,786
and a little self-discipline
on the part of counsel...

1654
01:46:16,871 --> 01:46:19,581
perhaps we can reach an end
by Saturday night.

1655
01:46:19,665 --> 01:46:22,542
Will you adjourn court?

1656
01:46:22,626 --> 01:46:27,714
Ηear ye, hear ye, hear ye. This court stands
adjourned until 9:00 tomorrow morning.

1657
01:47:08,422 --> 01:47:11,925
Ηe's banged up a little,
but there doesn't seem to be anything else.

1658
01:47:12,009 --> 01:47:14,052
We'd like to watch him for a day or so.

1659
01:47:14,720 --> 01:47:18,890
- How much damage did he do?
- Wrecked a gate and a barn door.

1660
01:47:20,184 --> 01:47:22,602
And he hasn't got a driver's license.

1661
01:47:23,646 --> 01:47:27,398
Ηe'll have to appear
in the J.P. court when he's able.

1662
01:47:27,483 --> 01:47:31,486
- The old fool.
- Speak kindly of the dead.

1663
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:34,489
- Do you mind if l have a minute with the corpse?
- Sure, Polly.

1664
01:47:38,786 --> 01:47:41,704
Now, was it worth trying to kill yourself...

1665
01:47:41,789 --> 01:47:44,124
for whatever it is you've been up to?

1666
01:47:44,792 --> 01:47:46,709
Ηow's the trial goin'?

1667
01:47:46,794 --> 01:47:50,171
Well, l'm making a lot of noise.
Dancer's racking up all the points.

1668
01:47:50,256 --> 01:47:52,799
No, but come on.
Now, where have you been?

1669
01:47:53,884 --> 01:47:58,054
Quill hired Mary Pilant
up north of the Sault Sainte Marie.

1670
01:47:58,139 --> 01:48:02,475
Struck me funny he'd go all the way up there
to hire somebody just to work for him.

1671
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:04,519
l been up there nosin' around.

1672
01:48:04,603 --> 01:48:06,771
Well, did you find anything useful?

1673
01:48:06,856 --> 01:48:09,732
Not until l looked up her birth certificate.

1674
01:48:09,817 --> 01:48:15,280
Born Blind River, Ontario,
1934, out of wedlock.

1675
01:48:15,364 --> 01:48:19,784
Simone Pilant.

1676
01:48:19,869 --> 01:48:24,164
- Father was a lumberjack.
- Barney Quill.

1677
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:34,090
Say, l'd like to see Miss Mary Pilant.

1678
01:48:34,675 --> 01:48:37,719
- lt's late, mister.
- l know. l know. This is important.

1679
01:48:37,803 --> 01:48:39,971
- Real important?
- Real important.

1680
01:48:42,725 --> 01:48:45,101
Yes?

1681
01:48:45,186 --> 01:48:49,147
Miss Pilant, sorry if l woke you up.
There's a guy to see you. Says it's real important.

1682
01:48:49,231 --> 01:48:50,773
- What's your, uh -
- Paul Biegler.

1683
01:48:50,858 --> 01:48:53,234
- Biegler.
- I don't wish to see him.

1684
01:48:53,319 --> 01:48:55,570
Okay.

1685
01:48:55,654 --> 01:48:57,822
She, uh, said it's not important enough.

1686
01:48:57,907 --> 01:49:02,035
All right. Now you call her back
and tell her l mentioned Blind River, Ontario.

1687
01:49:02,119 --> 01:49:04,037
l'll be in the bar.

1688
01:49:20,179 --> 01:49:21,971
Evening, Alphonse.

1689
01:49:22,056 --> 01:49:24,390
Drinking, Mr. Biegler, or just snooping?

1690
01:49:24,475 --> 01:49:26,392
Well, l think l'll try a little of both.

1691
01:49:26,477 --> 01:49:28,895
What do you say we start out with a beer?

1692
01:49:33,609 --> 01:49:35,777
On the house, and that's all you get.

1693
01:49:35,861 --> 01:49:38,488
A beer. No questions, no answers.

1694
01:49:38,572 --> 01:49:41,157
l'm just a lawyer trying to do my job.

1695
01:49:41,242 --> 01:49:43,159
What are you so afraid of, Al?

1696
01:49:46,413 --> 01:49:48,456
Will you sit over there, please?

1697
01:49:54,421 --> 01:49:56,339
Miss Pilant, l owe you an apology.

1698
01:49:56,423 --> 01:49:58,675
l was a little rough
when l was out here before.

1699
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:02,095
l didn't know that Barney Quill
was your father.

1700
01:50:02,179 --> 01:50:05,014
- You didn't come here just to apologize.
- No. No.

1701
01:50:05,099 --> 01:50:07,016
But the apology was part of it.

1702
01:50:07,101 --> 01:50:11,104
To tell the truth, l sort of hoped
maybe it would thaw you out a bit.

1703
01:50:11,814 --> 01:50:15,650
All l want you to do is just listen to me.
Just for a few minutes.

1704
01:50:16,235 --> 01:50:20,905
Now, l need some strong evidence
to back up Laura Manion's story about the rape.

1705
01:50:20,990 --> 01:50:24,409
The prosecution's gonna
attack that story pretty hard.

1706
01:50:24,493 --> 01:50:27,120
And if - if the jury thinks she's lying...

1707
01:50:27,204 --> 01:50:30,290
well, that could turn the decision
against Manion, you see.

1708
01:50:30,374 --> 01:50:35,044
Well, isn't she lying? Barney didn't do
what she said he did. Ηe couldn't have.

1709
01:50:35,671 --> 01:50:39,299
- What did you know about your father?
- All l needed to know.

1710
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:43,386
Ηe took care of me and of my mother
for as long as she lived.

1711
01:50:43,470 --> 01:50:46,723
Ηe was always there when l needed him.

1712
01:50:46,807 --> 01:50:49,058
That's what l know
about my father, Mr. Biegler.

1713
01:50:49,143 --> 01:50:51,728
Will that back up Laura Manion's story?

1714
01:50:51,812 --> 01:50:54,897
Miss Pilant, l don't want to get at you.
l don't want to hurt you.

1715
01:50:54,982 --> 01:50:57,191
l appreciate your affection for your father...

1716
01:50:57,276 --> 01:51:00,320
but - but as a lawyer l've had to learn...

1717
01:51:00,404 --> 01:51:03,156
that people aren't just good or just bad.

1718
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:05,408
But people are many things.

1719
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:08,703
And l kind of have a feeling
that Barney Quill was many things.

1720
01:51:08,787 --> 01:51:12,081
- l don't want to hear that.
- No, no, please. Please now, hear me out.

1721
01:51:12,166 --> 01:51:16,085
l believe that Barney told
Al Paquette what happened that night...

1722
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:19,422
and he told him to go to this window
and wait for Manion.

1723
01:51:19,506 --> 01:51:24,177
Barney stayed behind the bar
next to a gun rack, just waiting.

1724
01:51:24,261 --> 01:51:27,555
Manion came in and fired
the minute he got inside that door...

1725
01:51:27,639 --> 01:51:30,433
and the first shot went
right through Barney's heart.

1726
01:51:30,517 --> 01:51:32,852
Now, here's what l want you to do.

1727
01:51:32,936 --> 01:51:37,398
l want you to try to persuade Al
to come to the court as a defense witness...

1728
01:51:37,483 --> 01:51:40,610
and tell the court exactly
what Barney told him that night.

1729
01:51:40,694 --> 01:51:43,613
That he'd raped and assaulted Mrs. Manion.

1730
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:46,282
Al wouldn't conceal a thing like that.

1731
01:51:46,367 --> 01:51:48,409
Why wouldn't he tell it, if it were true?

1732
01:51:48,494 --> 01:51:51,746
l don't know. l don't know.
But l know this.

1733
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:55,291
Everybody loves something or someone.

1734
01:51:55,376 --> 01:51:57,335
Me, l love fishing...

1735
01:51:57,419 --> 01:51:59,629
and an old guy by the name of Parnell.

1736
01:51:59,713 --> 01:52:03,257
Manion loves his freedom.
Ηe'd like to have a little more of it.

1737
01:52:03,342 --> 01:52:06,969
Barney loved you. Maybe so does Al.

1738
01:52:07,638 --> 01:52:10,556
l wouldn't blame him.
But he doesn't want to hurt you.

1739
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:13,434
Ηe doesn't want you to know
the truth about Barney...

1740
01:52:13,519 --> 01:52:15,478
that he could be dangerous and brutal.

1741
01:52:15,562 --> 01:52:19,774
Now, if you'd just ask Al.
lf you could just ask him right straight out.

1742
01:52:20,484 --> 01:52:21,776
Al?

1743
01:52:30,119 --> 01:52:33,913
Al, Mr. Biegler knows
that Barney was my father.

1744
01:52:35,249 --> 01:52:38,334
He thinks you know something
about the night my father was killed...

1745
01:52:38,419 --> 01:52:40,837
something you won't tell.

1746
01:52:40,921 --> 01:52:43,548
Lawyer, l told you once,
and l'll tell you again.

1747
01:52:43,632 --> 01:52:46,426
- No questions, no answers.
- Wait, Al.

1748
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:51,514
Did my father rape Mrs. Manion?

1749
01:52:52,599 --> 01:52:54,517
Barney wouldn't hurt a woman.

1750
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:59,772
ls there any reason you wouldn't tell me
the truth about that, Al?

1751
01:53:00,941 --> 01:53:02,900
What reason?

1752
01:53:09,116 --> 01:53:11,659
- Anything else, Mr. Biegler?
- No.

1753
01:53:11,743 --> 01:53:14,620
l'm gonna leave a pass
for you and Al at the trial.

1754
01:53:14,705 --> 01:53:17,790
You might like to watch
Lieutenant Manion get convicted.

1755
01:53:18,375 --> 01:53:20,460
You gonna spread it around
about Mary being Barney's kid?

1756
01:53:20,544 --> 01:53:22,795
No, l'm not gonna spread it around, Al.

1757
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:26,132
Thank you for the beer.
Good night, Miss Pilant.

1758
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:32,972
All right,
now let's get at this rosary thing.

1759
01:53:33,056 --> 01:53:36,309
Now, it's been testified
that your wife swore to you on a rosary...

1760
01:53:36,393 --> 01:53:39,145
that she'd been raped by Barney Quill.

1761
01:53:39,229 --> 01:53:41,689
Did you ask your wife to swear on a rosary?

1762
01:53:42,733 --> 01:53:45,902
My wife was hysterical.
She wasn't making much sense.

1763
01:53:45,986 --> 01:53:49,155
l thought if l asked her
to take an oath on a rosary...

1764
01:53:49,239 --> 01:53:51,991
it might serve to calm her,
make her think more clearly.

1765
01:53:52,075 --> 01:53:53,993
Did the rosary help?

1766
01:53:54,077 --> 01:53:56,496
She was able to tell me
in detail what had happened.

1767
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:58,498
All right. Go on from there now.

1768
01:53:58,582 --> 01:54:00,833
What did you do then, Lieutenant?

1769
01:54:00,918 --> 01:54:04,504
Well, l - l had her lie on the bed...

1770
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:08,508
and l got some cold cloths for her head.

1771
01:54:08,592 --> 01:54:12,512
And, uh - Oh, yes.
l gave her a drink of brandy.

1772
01:54:14,765 --> 01:54:16,682
After a while she became calm...

1773
01:54:16,767 --> 01:54:19,352
seemed to go to sleep.

1774
01:54:19,436 --> 01:54:24,023
Then l went to the closet,
l got my gun, and l loaded it.

1775
01:54:24,107 --> 01:54:27,985
- Was it in your mind to kill Barney Quill?
- No.

1776
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:31,447
Well, then why did you go to the closet
and get your gun and load it?

1777
01:54:31,532 --> 01:54:35,034
Well, l-l-l knew l had to go to Quill's place.
l thought l might need it.

1778
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:36,869
Why?

1779
01:54:36,954 --> 01:54:39,705
l knew Mr. Quill kept guns behind the bar.

1780
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:41,707
l was afraid he might shoot me.

1781
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:45,169
Might shoot you if you did what?
What were you gonna do?

1782
01:54:46,213 --> 01:54:48,631
l'm not sure.

1783
01:54:48,715 --> 01:54:51,551
l remember having some idea...

1784
01:54:51,635 --> 01:54:53,886
of finding him...

1785
01:54:53,971 --> 01:54:56,889
and holding him while l called the police.

1786
01:54:56,974 --> 01:54:58,975
Well, that Mr. - what's his name -

1787
01:54:59,059 --> 01:55:01,936
Mr. Lemon, right at the tourist court there,
he was a deputy sheriff.

1788
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:03,938
Why didn't you get him to go with you?

1789
01:55:04,773 --> 01:55:08,901
Maybe because he always seemed to be
just the old caretaker of the park.

1790
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:14,031
Maybe because l wasn't
thinking about anything too clearly...

1791
01:55:14,116 --> 01:55:16,075
except finding Barney Quill.

1792
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:19,829
Why didn't you go to a telephone,
call the state police before you went to the bar?

1793
01:55:19,913 --> 01:55:22,081
l don't know.

1794
01:55:22,165 --> 01:55:24,417
l was in sort of a daze.

1795
01:55:25,502 --> 01:55:28,462
lt was a horrible thing
to see what had been done to my wife.

1796
01:55:28,547 --> 01:55:30,756
Now, you say you were in a sort of a daze.

1797
01:55:30,841 --> 01:55:34,260
When you got to the bar,
did you see that the bar was crowded?

1798
01:55:35,012 --> 01:55:36,929
l -

1799
01:55:37,014 --> 01:55:39,557
l didn't see anyone at the bar...

1800
01:55:40,350 --> 01:55:42,435
except Barney Quill.

1801
01:55:42,519 --> 01:55:44,437
Ηe was the only person l saw.

1802
01:55:44,521 --> 01:55:46,522
What was he doing?

1803
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:50,985
l think he was just
standing there behind the bar.

1804
01:55:51,069 --> 01:55:55,072
Well, now, did he make
a threatening move to get a gun?

1805
01:55:55,157 --> 01:55:56,699
l don't know.

1806
01:55:57,284 --> 01:55:58,909
Ηe may have. l don't know.

1807
01:55:58,994 --> 01:56:01,454
All right.
Now, you say you went there to find him...

1808
01:56:01,538 --> 01:56:03,623
to hold him for the police.

1809
01:56:03,707 --> 01:56:05,625
Why did you shoot him?

1810
01:56:07,711 --> 01:56:10,046
l don't remember shooting him.

1811
01:56:10,631 --> 01:56:12,465
Now, when you left the bar...

1812
01:56:12,549 --> 01:56:15,301
do you remember Alphonse Paquette
coming up to you and stopping you...

1813
01:56:15,385 --> 01:56:17,470
and saying,
"You'd better not run away from this"...

1814
01:56:17,554 --> 01:56:21,223
and your reply,
"Do you want some too, buster?"

1815
01:56:21,308 --> 01:56:22,808
Remember that?

1816
01:56:23,518 --> 01:56:25,811
l-l seem to have a vague recollection...

1817
01:56:25,896 --> 01:56:27,813
of somebody speaking to me...

1818
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:32,902
but l don't remember what l said
or what was said to me.

1819
01:56:32,986 --> 01:56:35,905
When did you realize that you had shot Quill?

1820
01:56:38,575 --> 01:56:40,993
l was - l was getting a drink of water.

1821
01:56:41,078 --> 01:56:43,996
l remember my throat was so dry it hurt.

1822
01:56:45,582 --> 01:56:48,000
And when l put the glass down,
l saw the gun...

1823
01:56:48,085 --> 01:56:50,503
on the kitchen sink beside the tap.

1824
01:56:51,588 --> 01:56:53,589
l noticed the gun was empty.

1825
01:56:54,675 --> 01:56:57,343
Now l'd like you to show the court and jury...

1826
01:56:57,427 --> 01:56:59,011
just, uh -

1827
01:56:59,971 --> 01:57:02,515
just how you knew this gun was empty.

1828
01:57:02,599 --> 01:57:05,017
Well, this gadget here...

1829
01:57:05,102 --> 01:57:08,396
when it sticks up,
you know the last round's been fired.

1830
01:57:09,106 --> 01:57:12,191
Lieutenant Manion,
on the night of the shooting...

1831
01:57:12,275 --> 01:57:14,193
did you love your wife?

1832
01:57:14,277 --> 01:57:17,655
- Yes, sir.
- Do you still love her?

1833
01:57:21,118 --> 01:57:22,952
Very much.

1834
01:57:23,704 --> 01:57:25,746
The witness is yours, Mr. Dancer.

1835
01:57:25,831 --> 01:57:27,707
Lieutenant Manion...

1836
01:57:28,959 --> 01:57:31,210
how many men have you killed?

1837
01:57:31,294 --> 01:57:33,212
Now wait a minute.

1838
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:37,216
Your Ηonor, a man's war record -
in Lieutenant Manion's case, a great record -

1839
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:39,218
certainly shouldn't be used against him.

1840
01:57:39,302 --> 01:57:42,221
Your Ηonor, l'm as patriotic as the next man...

1841
01:57:42,305 --> 01:57:47,059
but the simple truth is,
war can condition a man to killing other men.

1842
01:57:47,144 --> 01:57:49,895
l simply want to determine
how conditioned the lieutenant may be...

1843
01:57:49,980 --> 01:57:53,482
to the use of firearms
on other human beings.

1844
01:57:53,567 --> 01:57:55,484
l don't quite like the question, Mr. Biegler...

1845
01:57:55,569 --> 01:57:57,570
but l don't see how l can exclude it.

1846
01:57:57,654 --> 01:57:59,572
Let him answer.

1847
01:57:59,656 --> 01:58:02,908
l know l killed
at least four men in Korea...

1848
01:58:02,993 --> 01:58:04,910
three with a hand grenade...

1849
01:58:04,995 --> 01:58:07,246
and one with my service automatic.

1850
01:58:07,330 --> 01:58:11,083
l may have killed others.
A soldier doesn't always know.

1851
01:58:11,168 --> 01:58:13,419
Now, Lieutenant, in these acts of killing...

1852
01:58:13,503 --> 01:58:15,421
did you ever have a lapse of memory...

1853
01:58:15,505 --> 01:58:18,090
- such as you had when you killed Barney Quill?
- No, sir.

1854
01:58:18,175 --> 01:58:20,593
Did you ever have
a lapse of memory during battle?

1855
01:58:20,677 --> 01:58:23,095
- No, sir.
- Were you ever submitted to a constant barrage...

1856
01:58:23,180 --> 01:58:25,097
constantly in a sweat for many hours...

1857
01:58:25,182 --> 01:58:27,266
- constantly under attack, or attacking?
- Many times.

1858
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:29,268
Were you ever treated for shell shock,
battle fatigue...

1859
01:58:29,352 --> 01:58:31,437
- or any war neurosis or psychosis?
- No, sir.

1860
01:58:31,521 --> 01:58:35,775
Did you ever experience
any unusual mental state during the war?

1861
01:58:35,859 --> 01:58:38,611
- Well, l do remember having one great urge.
- What was that?

1862
01:58:38,695 --> 01:58:42,114
To get the hell out and go home.

1863
01:58:42,199 --> 01:58:46,452
You would do well to consider the seriousness
of the situation you are in.

1864
01:58:46,536 --> 01:58:49,622
- l'm sorry, Your Honor.
- l sympathize with the lieutenant.

1865
01:58:49,706 --> 01:58:53,626
l expect he has the same feeling
about getting out of jail.

1866
01:58:53,710 --> 01:58:56,796
But the main point here, Lieutenant,
is that at no time during your war service...

1867
01:58:56,880 --> 01:58:58,798
did you have a record of mental disturbance.

1868
01:58:58,882 --> 01:59:00,966
You were always in complete possession
of your faculties.

1869
01:59:01,051 --> 01:59:03,636
Yes, sir, that's right.

1870
01:59:03,720 --> 01:59:06,305
- No more questions.
- No redirect, Your Ηonor.

1871
01:59:06,389 --> 01:59:08,974
Step down, please. Call your next witness.

1872
01:59:09,059 --> 01:59:11,644
We call Laura Manion to the stand.

1873
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:26,659
- Up these stairs and to the right.
- Thank you.

1874
01:59:33,166 --> 01:59:35,626
Now, how long after you told your husband
what had happened...

1875
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:37,962
did he leave the trailer?

1876
01:59:38,046 --> 01:59:40,130
l don't know exactly.

1877
01:59:40,215 --> 01:59:42,132
Everything was kind of fuzzy. l -

1878
01:59:42,217 --> 01:59:44,635
l was faint, and l lay down on the bed.

1879
01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:46,804
Ηe sat beside me.

1880
01:59:46,888 --> 01:59:49,974
l vaguely remember
his getting up and going out.

1881
01:59:50,058 --> 01:59:52,643
l remember wondering
if he was going for a doctor.

1882
01:59:52,727 --> 01:59:54,895
And then he came back in.

1883
01:59:54,980 --> 01:59:57,481
lt seemed like just a few seconds,
but it must have been longer.

1884
01:59:57,566 --> 01:59:59,775
l must have gone to sleep.

1885
02:00:00,527 --> 02:00:03,153
When he came back in,
he sat on the bed...

1886
02:00:03,238 --> 02:00:05,447
and he had a gun in his hand.

1887
02:00:05,532 --> 02:00:08,617
And l said, "What are you going to do?"

1888
02:00:08,702 --> 02:00:11,662
And he said, "l think l've already done it.

1889
02:00:11,746 --> 02:00:13,831
l think l've killed Barney Quill."

1890
02:00:13,915 --> 02:00:17,334
Are you sure he didn't say
"l've killed Barney Quill"?

1891
02:00:17,419 --> 02:00:20,004
No, l - l remember distinctly.

1892
02:00:20,088 --> 02:00:22,006
"l think l've killed Barney Quill."

1893
02:00:22,090 --> 02:00:24,174
Then what did you do?

1894
02:00:24,259 --> 02:00:28,679
l put my arms around him
and began to cry and -

1895
02:00:28,763 --> 02:00:31,515
and l said,
"You'd better go to Mr. Lemon."

1896
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:33,517
And my husband said, "l forgot about that."

1897
02:00:33,602 --> 02:00:36,520
What did he mean? Forgot about what?

1898
02:00:36,605 --> 02:00:39,690
Well, he meant that he'd forgotten
Mr. Lemon was a deputy sheriff.

1899
02:00:39,774 --> 02:00:43,402
And he said,
"Yes, l'll go turn myself in to Mr. Lemon."

1900
02:00:43,486 --> 02:00:47,698
Yes, l see. Your Ηonor, l have no other
direct questions at this time...

1901
02:00:47,782 --> 02:00:50,367
but since l'm sure
it's difficult to visualize...

1902
02:00:50,452 --> 02:00:53,537
the part a little dog played on this night...

1903
02:00:53,622 --> 02:00:57,541
l should like a few minutes to show the court
this remarkable little animal.

1904
02:00:57,626 --> 02:00:59,543
Do the People object?

1905
02:00:59,628 --> 02:01:01,545
l'm sure if we raise an objection,
Your Honor...

1906
02:01:01,630 --> 02:01:04,924
Mr. Biegler will declare that we're
haters of all small, furry animals.

1907
02:01:05,008 --> 02:01:08,886
A creature that cannot talk
will be a welcome relief.

1908
02:01:08,970 --> 02:01:11,221
Bring in the dog.

1909
02:01:11,306 --> 02:01:15,851
Thank you, sir.
Will the, uh, deputy bring in the dog, please.

1910
02:01:28,990 --> 02:01:31,283
Uh, you can put him right there.

1911
02:01:32,452 --> 02:01:34,370
Fine.
Ηere, Muff! Here, Muff! Come on!

1912
02:01:34,454 --> 02:01:36,372
Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on!

1913
02:01:36,456 --> 02:01:38,457
That's a boy.

1914
02:01:39,125 --> 02:01:42,795
And now l'll ask Mrs. Manion
to bring a flashlight for the dog.

1915
02:01:53,848 --> 02:01:58,310
Now, l ask the court to notice
that the dog turned on the light.

1916
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:10,072
Well, it's easy to see that Muff
doesn't know who his enemies are.

1917
02:02:10,156 --> 02:02:12,282
Remove the dog, please.

1918
02:02:12,367 --> 02:02:14,284
- Yes, sir.
- The witness will resume the stand.

1919
02:02:14,369 --> 02:02:17,496
Ηere we go, Muff. All right.

1920
02:02:18,873 --> 02:02:23,127
Mrs. Manion, may l congratulate you
on your well-trained pet.

1921
02:02:23,211 --> 02:02:25,129
May l also say that l'm pleased to see...

1922
02:02:25,213 --> 02:02:28,465
you are not today
hiding your lovely hair under a hat.

1923
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:32,469
Your Ηonor, is the assistant attorney general
from Lansing pitching woo...

1924
02:02:32,554 --> 02:02:34,847
or is he going to cross-examine?

1925
02:02:34,931 --> 02:02:36,473
Let's get on with it.

1926
02:02:36,558 --> 02:02:38,809
Mrs. Manion, what was your occupation
before you were married?

1927
02:02:38,893 --> 02:02:41,895
- Ηousewife.
- Oh, then you've been married before?

1928
02:02:41,980 --> 02:02:46,608
- Yes, once.
- l suppose your first husband, uh, died, hmm?

1929
02:02:46,693 --> 02:02:47,693
No.

1930
02:02:47,777 --> 02:02:50,320
Did you divorce your first husband
to marry Lieutenant Manion?

1931
02:02:50,405 --> 02:02:52,990
Your Honor, if counsel wants to know
the grounds for Mrs. Manion's divorce...

1932
02:02:53,074 --> 02:02:54,616
let him ask that question.

1933
02:02:54,701 --> 02:02:56,452
What were the grounds for divorce,
Mrs. Manion?

1934
02:02:56,536 --> 02:03:00,164
- Mental cruelty.
- Naturally. And how long after your divorce...

1935
02:03:00,248 --> 02:03:02,458
was it that you married
Lieutenant Manion?

1936
02:03:02,542 --> 02:03:04,251
Uh, l'm not sure.

1937
02:03:04,335 --> 02:03:07,337
May l refresh the witness's memory
for Mr. Dancer?

1938
02:03:07,422 --> 02:03:09,339
- By all means.
- l believe she told me...

1939
02:03:09,424 --> 02:03:12,843
that they were married
three days after the divorce.

1940
02:03:12,927 --> 02:03:15,179
Thank you, Mr. Biegler.
ls that correct, Mrs. Manion?

1941
02:03:15,263 --> 02:03:16,722
Yes.

1942
02:03:16,806 --> 02:03:19,433
Then unless yours
was a whirlwind courtship...

1943
02:03:19,517 --> 02:03:21,643
you must have known Lieutenant Manion
before your divorce.

1944
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:23,687
- Did you?
- Yes.

1945
02:03:24,647 --> 02:03:28,358
Mrs. Manion, what is your -
religious affiliation?

1946
02:03:28,443 --> 02:03:30,360
l'm a Catholic.

1947
02:03:30,445 --> 02:03:33,739
- Catholic in good standing?
- Well, no. The divorce, you know.

1948
02:03:33,823 --> 02:03:36,700
You mean you were excommunicated
because of the divorce and remarriage?

1949
02:03:36,785 --> 02:03:37,910
Yes.

1950
02:03:38,495 --> 02:03:42,164
Mrs. Manion, wouldn't you say
that a Catholic who can blithely ignore...

1951
02:03:42,248 --> 02:03:44,708
one of the cardinal rules of her church...

1952
02:03:44,793 --> 02:03:48,045
could also easily ignore
an oath taken on one of its artifacts...

1953
02:03:48,129 --> 02:03:50,589
say, an oath taken on a rosary?

1954
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:54,426
l-l-l don't think that's true.

1955
02:03:54,511 --> 02:03:57,888
But wouldn't you think there'd be some doubt
about the integrity of such a person?

1956
02:03:58,598 --> 02:04:00,599
l don't know. Uh -

1957
02:04:00,683 --> 02:04:03,227
All l know is the rosary
means something to me.

1958
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:07,898
l see.
Well, l'll pass on to something else.

1959
02:04:07,982 --> 02:04:10,734
Mrs. Manion, you testified
that your husband came home late...

1960
02:04:10,819 --> 02:04:12,569
from his work
on the night of the shooting.

1961
02:04:12,654 --> 02:04:14,571
Were you a little angry about his being late?

1962
02:04:14,656 --> 02:04:16,907
Well, l-l - l guess l was a little put out.

1963
02:04:16,991 --> 02:04:19,910
- Did you have an argument?
- Not much. A little.

1964
02:04:19,994 --> 02:04:22,079
When you left the trailer to go to the inn...

1965
02:04:22,163 --> 02:04:24,039
did your husband know you were going?

1966
02:04:24,124 --> 02:04:25,624
Ηe was asleep.

1967
02:04:25,708 --> 02:04:27,751
Was part of your reason
for going without his knowledge...

1968
02:04:27,836 --> 02:04:30,129
because you were, uh, vexed?

1969
02:04:31,089 --> 02:04:34,258
Well, l-l'd been ironing all day and l -

1970
02:04:35,009 --> 02:04:38,095
- Yes, l guess that's true.
- Your Honor, the counsel has deliberately...

1971
02:04:38,179 --> 02:04:39,805
cut off my view of the witness.

1972
02:04:39,889 --> 02:04:41,390
l'm sorry, Mr. Biegler.

1973
02:04:41,474 --> 02:04:43,684
l wouldn't want to interfere
with your signals to Mrs. Manion.

1974
02:04:43,768 --> 02:04:46,103
l object to the implication
l was signaling the witness.

1975
02:04:46,187 --> 02:04:49,106
This is the shabbiest
courtroom trick l've ever seen.

1976
02:04:49,190 --> 02:04:51,108
You haven't lived, Mr. Biegler.

1977
02:04:51,192 --> 02:04:53,569
Your Ηonor, l ask the court
to rule on my objection.

1978
02:04:53,653 --> 02:04:55,946
Mr. Dancer, will you be careful
not to place yourself...

1979
02:04:56,030 --> 02:04:58,323
between Mr. Biegler and his witness.

1980
02:04:58,408 --> 02:05:01,952
Of course, Your Honor.
Anything else, Mr. Biegler?

1981
02:05:02,036 --> 02:05:03,954
You do it once more, l'll punt you...

1982
02:05:04,038 --> 02:05:06,582
all the way out into
the middle of Lake Superior.

1983
02:05:06,666 --> 02:05:10,002
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

1984
02:05:10,086 --> 02:05:12,379
This rowing has got to stop.

1985
02:05:12,463 --> 02:05:16,466
The next one of you that speaks out of turn
will have me to deal with.

1986
02:05:16,551 --> 02:05:18,677
Now get on with your cross-examination.

1987
02:05:18,761 --> 02:05:22,014
Would you have gone to the inn
if your husband had, uh, been awake?

1988
02:05:22,098 --> 02:05:25,517
- He probably would have gone with me.
- But would you have gone alone?

1989
02:05:25,602 --> 02:05:29,188
- Not if he didn't want me to.
- Would he have not wanted you to?

1990
02:05:29,856 --> 02:05:32,566
l'm not sure.
l - l don't know how to answer that.

1991
02:05:32,650 --> 02:05:34,693
Well, had you ever gone
to the Thunder Bay lnn...

1992
02:05:34,777 --> 02:05:37,905
or elsewhere in Thunder Bay
alone at night?

1993
02:05:38,406 --> 02:05:41,617
- Yes, sometimes.
- Did your husband know you were going?

1994
02:05:42,493 --> 02:05:44,661
Not always. He goes to sleep early and -

1995
02:05:44,746 --> 02:05:47,623
and sometimes l'm restless.

1996
02:05:47,707 --> 02:05:49,833
Where did you go on these occasions?

1997
02:05:49,918 --> 02:05:53,712
Oh, l'd take a walk by the lake
or went to the bingo place.

1998
02:05:53,796 --> 02:05:57,216
- Maybe to the inn.
- You ever go to meet another man?

1999
02:05:57,759 --> 02:06:00,010
No, l didn't. l never did that.

2000
02:06:00,553 --> 02:06:04,348
You mean to say, Mrs. Manion,
a lovely woman like yourself, attractive to men...

2001
02:06:04,432 --> 02:06:06,475
lonely, restless, that you never once -

2002
02:06:06,559 --> 02:06:09,519
Objection, Your Honor! The witness
has answered the question about other men.

2003
02:06:09,604 --> 02:06:12,356
Counsel is now making
a veiled suggestion to the jury.

2004
02:06:12,440 --> 02:06:14,524
l withdraw the question.

2005
02:06:14,609 --> 02:06:19,071
Now, Mrs. Manion, on these
occasional excursions into the night...

2006
02:06:19,155 --> 02:06:21,657
did you always go and return home alone?

2007
02:06:21,741 --> 02:06:23,283
Of course.

2008
02:06:23,368 --> 02:06:26,870
Mrs. Manion, you testified that the reason
you got into Barney Quill's car...

2009
02:06:26,955 --> 02:06:29,206
was because you were afraid
to go home alone.

2010
02:06:29,290 --> 02:06:31,458
Why were you so frightened
on this particular night?

2011
02:06:32,418 --> 02:06:36,004
l said that it was because he told me
bears had been seen around.

2012
02:06:36,589 --> 02:06:40,842
Was this the first time you'd heard that bears
came around Thunder Bay to pick up scraps?

2013
02:06:40,927 --> 02:06:43,262
- No.
- Had you seen the bears before?

2014
02:06:43,346 --> 02:06:44,513
Yes.

2015
02:06:44,597 --> 02:06:47,057
Oh, this was just the first time
you were afraid of them?

2016
02:06:47,141 --> 02:06:49,268
No, l was always afraid of them.

2017
02:06:49,352 --> 02:06:51,603
Oh, this was just the first time
you were enough afraid...

2018
02:06:51,688 --> 02:06:54,731
to allow a man to take you home
from one of your evening prowls?

2019
02:06:54,816 --> 02:06:58,402
Objection! The use of the word "prowl"
is meant to mislead the jury.

2020
02:06:58,486 --> 02:07:00,570
- Sustained.
- l apologize.

2021
02:07:00,655 --> 02:07:04,658
Mrs. Manion, l didn't mean to imply
that you were a huntress.

2022
02:07:04,742 --> 02:07:06,702
Was this the first time
that you were enough afraid...

2023
02:07:06,786 --> 02:07:10,122
to allow a man to take you home
from one of your evening walks?

2024
02:07:10,832 --> 02:07:13,667
Well, it - it wasn't just that.

2025
02:07:13,751 --> 02:07:15,627
- lt was -
- Oh, come now, Mrs. Manion.

2026
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:18,547
You should be able to answer that straight off.
That's a simple enough question.

2027
02:07:18,631 --> 02:07:20,799
Your Honor,
how can the witness answer straight off...

2028
02:07:20,883 --> 02:07:23,218
when the counsel keeps
interrupting the answer?

2029
02:07:23,303 --> 02:07:26,430
The witness seemed a little slow to me,
Mr. Biegler.

2030
02:07:26,514 --> 02:07:29,433
Ηowever, let her complete her answers
before you interrupt.

2031
02:07:29,517 --> 02:07:32,269
Of course, Your Honor.
ln any case, Mr. Biegler's objection...

2032
02:07:32,353 --> 02:07:35,230
has given Mrs. Manion sufficient time
to think of an answer to my question.

2033
02:07:35,315 --> 02:07:37,274
You've thought of one,
haven't you, Mrs. Manion?

2034
02:07:37,358 --> 02:07:40,610
What l was going to say
was that l didn't want to offend Mr. Quill...

2035
02:07:40,695 --> 02:07:43,947
by making him think
that l was afraid of him or didn't like him.

2036
02:07:44,032 --> 02:07:47,743
Ηe'd been very pleasant to my husband and me
when we'd been in his bar.

2037
02:07:47,827 --> 02:07:51,455
- That's very good, Mrs. Manion. Very good indeed.
- Your Ηonor, please.

2038
02:07:51,539 --> 02:07:55,959
The attorney for the People will reserve
his comments for the arguments.

2039
02:07:56,044 --> 02:07:58,503
l will ask you this question, Mrs. Manion.

2040
02:07:59,088 --> 02:08:04,217
Was this the first time you had been
in Barney Quill's car at night?

2041
02:08:07,180 --> 02:08:09,681
Mrs. Manion, did you hear the question?

2042
02:08:10,224 --> 02:08:11,808
Yes, l heard.

2043
02:08:12,560 --> 02:08:14,853
Yes, it was the first time.

2044
02:08:15,563 --> 02:08:18,398
Would you raise your voice a little,
Mrs. Manion?

2045
02:08:18,483 --> 02:08:21,193
l said it was the first time.

2046
02:08:22,278 --> 02:08:26,656
Now, Mrs. Manion,
l'm quite concerned about the lost panties.

2047
02:08:26,741 --> 02:08:29,534
Would you describe this article of clothing
to the court, please?

2048
02:08:31,329 --> 02:08:33,997
They were nylon
and had lace up the sides.

2049
02:08:34,082 --> 02:08:36,500
There was a label in them
of the place l got them -

2050
02:08:36,584 --> 02:08:38,502
the Smart Shop, in Phoenix, Arizona.

2051
02:08:38,586 --> 02:08:40,504
What was the color of the panties?

2052
02:08:40,588 --> 02:08:42,506
- l believe white.
- You believe?

2053
02:08:42,590 --> 02:08:45,509
- l have white and pink. They may have been pink.
- You're not sure?

2054
02:08:45,593 --> 02:08:48,470
Haven't you checked your lingerie
to see which pair of panties is missing?

2055
02:08:48,554 --> 02:08:49,554
No.

2056
02:08:49,639 --> 02:08:51,473
When your husband came home
late from his work...

2057
02:08:51,557 --> 02:08:54,851
and you had this little spat,
were you already dressed to go out?

2058
02:08:54,936 --> 02:08:56,770
- No.
- When did you dress?

2059
02:08:56,854 --> 02:08:58,563
After dinner, when he was asleep.

2060
02:08:58,648 --> 02:09:01,733
lt's been stated here that you were
bare legged in the bar. ls that true?

2061
02:09:01,818 --> 02:09:02,859
Yes.

2062
02:09:02,944 --> 02:09:05,695
ln your anger at your husband
and your haste to get out of the trailer...

2063
02:09:05,780 --> 02:09:07,906
- perhaps you didn't put on any panties either?
- Objection.

2064
02:09:07,990 --> 02:09:10,409
The witness has already testified
as to what she was wearing.

2065
02:09:10,493 --> 02:09:13,036
- Sustained.
- Do you always wear panties, Mrs. Manion?

2066
02:09:13,121 --> 02:09:15,872
Now, Your Honor,
l object to this line of questioning.

2067
02:09:15,957 --> 02:09:18,834
lt's immaterial what
Mrs. Manion does all the time.

2068
02:09:18,918 --> 02:09:21,128
On the night she was attacked,
she was wearing panties...

2069
02:09:21,212 --> 02:09:22,838
and that's all we're concerned with.

2070
02:09:22,922 --> 02:09:25,382
Your Ηonor, Mrs. Manion seems
a little bit uncertain...

2071
02:09:25,466 --> 02:09:27,592
about what kind of panties she was wearing...

2072
02:09:27,677 --> 02:09:29,594
and since these panties have not been found...

2073
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:33,432
l submit that it's possible
she wasn't wearing any and has forgotten.

2074
02:09:33,516 --> 02:09:36,935
- That's all l'm trying to get at.
- You may answer, Mrs. Manion.

2075
02:09:38,020 --> 02:09:40,272
Do you always wear panties?

2076
02:09:41,357 --> 02:09:43,024
No.

2077
02:09:43,109 --> 02:09:46,111
On what occasions don't you wear them?
When you go out alone at night?

2078
02:09:46,195 --> 02:09:50,115
Oh, no, no. Objection. Ηe says he's going after
one thing, then he goes after another.

2079
02:09:50,199 --> 02:09:52,075
l'll sustain the objection.

2080
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:55,787
Strike out the last two questions
and Mrs. Manion's answer.

2081
02:09:55,872 --> 02:09:58,623
Now, Mr. Dancer, get off the panties.

2082
02:09:58,708 --> 02:10:02,294
- You've done enough damage.
- Yes, Your Honor.

2083
02:10:02,378 --> 02:10:06,298
Mrs. Manion, is your husband a jealous man?

2084
02:10:06,841 --> 02:10:09,968
- Ηe loves me.
- l'm sure of that, but is he excessively jealous?

2085
02:10:10,052 --> 02:10:12,804
Your Ηonor, how can the witness
answer that question?

2086
02:10:12,889 --> 02:10:14,973
What's the norm of jealousy?

2087
02:10:15,057 --> 02:10:18,059
Can you put your question a little differently,
Mr. Dancer?

2088
02:10:18,144 --> 02:10:20,187
Ηas your husband ever struck you
in a jealous rage?

2089
02:10:20,271 --> 02:10:24,357
No. Your Ηonor, l think Mr. Dancer's fishing now.
What's the relevancy of this question?

2090
02:10:24,442 --> 02:10:26,485
Your Ηonor,
the shoe is squeezing Mr. Biegler's foot.

2091
02:10:26,569 --> 02:10:28,778
ln his own words,
this is not a high school debate...

2092
02:10:28,863 --> 02:10:30,822
this is a cross-examination in a murder trial.

2093
02:10:30,907 --> 02:10:32,824
Proceed, Mr. Dancer.

2094
02:10:34,410 --> 02:10:36,161
Mrs. Manion...

2095
02:10:37,246 --> 02:10:40,332
did you ever go out socially
in Thunder Bay?

2096
02:10:40,416 --> 02:10:42,334
Yes, a few times.

2097
02:10:42,418 --> 02:10:44,503
When your husband's outfit
moved to Thunder Bay...

2098
02:10:44,587 --> 02:10:46,546
didn't Barney Quill throw a cocktail party...

2099
02:10:46,631 --> 02:10:49,007
- for the officers and their wives?
- Yes.

2100
02:10:49,091 --> 02:10:52,344
Didn't your husband strike
a young second lieutenant at this party?

2101
02:10:54,096 --> 02:10:56,389
There was a little scuffle. lt wasn't much.

2102
02:10:56,474 --> 02:10:59,476
- What was it about?
- l'm not sure l remember.

2103
02:10:59,560 --> 02:11:03,730
- Were you too drunk to remember?
- No, l was not.

2104
02:11:04,774 --> 02:11:07,651
l-l-l think it was because the lieutenant...

2105
02:11:07,735 --> 02:11:10,820
was cutting in too much
when l was dancing with my husband.

2106
02:11:10,905 --> 02:11:13,073
And shortly afterwards,
on the veranda of the inn...

2107
02:11:13,157 --> 02:11:16,493
didn't your husband slap you hard enough
so that you fell against the wall?

2108
02:11:17,703 --> 02:11:21,665
- Well, h-he was drinking.
- Wasn't this a jealous rage?

2109
02:11:22,416 --> 02:11:25,168
- l don't know!
- Do you remember why he struck you?

2110
02:11:25,253 --> 02:11:27,170
- Yes.
- Wasn't he enraged at you...

2111
02:11:27,255 --> 02:11:29,673
because he thought you'd encouraged
this young lieutenant?

2112
02:11:29,757 --> 02:11:31,675
Ηe might have thought so.

2113
02:11:31,759 --> 02:11:33,718
Mrs. Manion,
there are witnesses to this whole affair.

2114
02:11:33,803 --> 02:11:36,012
l'll ask you again. Wasn't this a jealous rage?

2115
02:11:36,097 --> 02:11:38,557
l guess you could call it that.

2116
02:11:39,767 --> 02:11:41,726
Now l'll ask you...

2117
02:11:43,437 --> 02:11:47,691
on the night of the shooting,
what did you swear?

2118
02:11:47,775 --> 02:11:50,235
What oath did you take on the rosary?

2119
02:11:51,279 --> 02:11:53,863
lt was about Barney Quill raping me.

2120
02:11:53,948 --> 02:11:56,992
Why did you swear on the rosary
that he raped you?

2121
02:11:57,535 --> 02:12:00,120
For the reason that my husband said -
because l was hysterical.

2122
02:12:00,204 --> 02:12:02,205
That was the reason he gave
for asking you to swear.

2123
02:12:02,290 --> 02:12:04,207
- What was your reason for swearing?
- So he'd believe me.

2124
02:12:04,292 --> 02:12:06,209
- Why shouldn't he believe you?
- Objection.

2125
02:12:06,294 --> 02:12:08,545
The reason for the use of the rosary
has been established.

2126
02:12:08,629 --> 02:12:13,800
- These questions are immaterial.
- No, l think l'll take the answer, Mr. Biegler.

2127
02:12:13,884 --> 02:12:15,719
l'll ask you again, Mrs. Manion.

2128
02:12:15,803 --> 02:12:17,929
Why shouldn't he believe you?

2129
02:12:19,265 --> 02:12:21,224
Because l wasn't making much sense.

2130
02:12:21,309 --> 02:12:23,351
Did he think you'd lie about a thing like that?

2131
02:12:23,436 --> 02:12:26,896
Objection, Your Ηonor! Lieutenant Manion
has already testified as to what he thought.

2132
02:12:26,981 --> 02:12:30,609
- Sustained.
- Did your husband strike you that night?

2133
02:12:31,277 --> 02:12:33,445
Did he hit you that night?

2134
02:12:35,698 --> 02:12:37,741
Well, he - he -

2135
02:12:37,825 --> 02:12:41,369
Ηe may have slapped me
because l was hysterical.

2136
02:12:41,454 --> 02:12:44,080
And didn't you swear to a lie to keep him
from hitting you again?

2137
02:12:44,165 --> 02:12:45,790
No! No, l didn't. l did not.

2138
02:12:45,875 --> 02:12:48,126
Hadn't he already beaten you up
at the gate when he caught you...

2139
02:12:48,210 --> 02:12:50,587
- coming home from lovers' lane with Barney Quill?
- Objection! Objection!

2140
02:12:50,671 --> 02:12:53,423
The witness has already testified
she was beaten by Barney Quill.

2141
02:12:53,507 --> 02:12:55,592
Quiet, quiet.

2142
02:12:55,676 --> 02:12:58,428
No more questions.

2143
02:12:58,512 --> 02:13:01,097
l think the witness has had enough,
Your Ηonor.

2144
02:13:01,182 --> 02:13:04,267
The witness may step down.
We'll recess for lunch.

2145
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:08,772
00.

2146
02:13:11,484 --> 02:13:13,401
Sorry, baby. You were fine.

2147
02:13:46,894 --> 02:13:48,812
Dr. Smith?

2148
02:13:48,896 --> 02:13:50,814
l've come to meet you, sir.

2149
02:13:50,898 --> 02:13:53,316
- My name is -
- l'm sorry. You've made a mistake.

2150
02:13:53,401 --> 02:13:56,486
Maybe l'm the one you're looking for.
Are you Mr. Biegler?

2151
02:13:56,570 --> 02:13:58,905
No, l'm his associate in the case.

2152
02:13:59,448 --> 02:14:02,158
- Don't tell me you're Dr. Smith.
- That's me.

2153
02:14:02,243 --> 02:14:06,830
- The army psychiatrist?
- Maybe you expected me to be in uniform.

2154
02:14:06,914 --> 02:14:08,832
No. Well...

2155
02:14:08,916 --> 02:14:11,668
l didn't expect anybody so young.

2156
02:14:11,752 --> 02:14:13,670
l'm 40.

2157
02:14:13,754 --> 02:14:18,675
l sort of hoped you'd, uh, have a beard
and wear a monocle.

2158
02:14:18,759 --> 02:14:20,719
Oh, l see.

2159
02:14:21,345 --> 02:14:26,099
- That better?
- lt helps. You're on the stand this afternoon.

2160
02:14:28,602 --> 02:14:30,520
Doctor, have you formed an opinion...

2161
02:14:30,604 --> 02:14:32,522
as to Frederick Manion's
mental and emotional state...

2162
02:14:32,606 --> 02:14:34,524
at the time he killed Barney Quill?

2163
02:14:34,608 --> 02:14:36,526
- l have.
- And what is that opinion?

2164
02:14:36,610 --> 02:14:39,362
He was temporarily insane
at the time of the shooting.

2165
02:14:39,447 --> 02:14:41,364
At the time of the shooting, do you believe...

2166
02:14:41,449 --> 02:14:43,867
he was able to distinguish right from wrong?

2167
02:14:43,951 --> 02:14:46,870
Ηe may or may not have been.
lt doesn't make too much difference.

2168
02:14:46,954 --> 02:14:50,039
All right. Now, Doctor,
as clearly as you can...

2169
02:14:50,124 --> 02:14:54,002
will you explain Frederick Manion's
temporary insanity.

2170
02:14:54,086 --> 02:14:57,005
lt is known as dissociative reaction -

2171
02:14:57,089 --> 02:15:01,718
a psychic shock which creates
an almost overwhelming tension...

2172
02:15:01,802 --> 02:15:05,054
which the person in shock must alleviate.

2173
02:15:05,139 --> 02:15:07,557
ln Lieutenant Manion's case - a soldier -

2174
02:15:07,641 --> 02:15:10,393
it is only natural
that he would turn to action.

2175
02:15:10,478 --> 02:15:14,230
Only direct, simple action
against Barney Quill...

2176
02:15:14,315 --> 02:15:16,816
would relieve this unbearable tension.

2177
02:15:16,901 --> 02:15:20,028
This is not too uncommon.
For example, in combat...

2178
02:15:20,112 --> 02:15:23,490
some of the more remarkable heroics
take place in this state of mind.

2179
02:15:23,574 --> 02:15:27,702
ls there another name for dissociative reaction,
one we might be more likely to recognize?

2180
02:15:27,787 --> 02:15:31,122
Yes, it has been known
as "irresistible impulse."

2181
02:15:31,207 --> 02:15:34,250
Now, Doctor,
a man in the grip of irresistible impulse -

2182
02:15:34,335 --> 02:15:36,753
would he be likely
to go to his neighbor for advice...

2183
02:15:36,837 --> 02:15:39,714
or call up the police to come to his aid?

2184
02:15:39,799 --> 02:15:43,426
- Completely incompatible.
- Yes. But our man was able to think...

2185
02:15:43,511 --> 02:15:45,804
of going and taking out a gun and loading it...

2186
02:15:45,888 --> 02:15:47,889
before setting out to find Quill.

2187
02:15:47,973 --> 02:15:49,808
Well, that was his conscious mind working.

2188
02:15:49,892 --> 02:15:52,393
But if no gun had been available,
he would have gone anyway.

2189
02:15:52,478 --> 02:15:55,939
Ηow would a man look in the grip
of dissociative reaction?

2190
02:15:56,023 --> 02:16:00,276
Ηe might appear to be deadly calm,
fiercely deliberate.

2191
02:16:00,361 --> 02:16:03,321
Mm-hmm. Would you describe
his behavior as being...

2192
02:16:03,405 --> 02:16:05,865
like a mailman delivering the mail?

2193
02:16:05,950 --> 02:16:10,161
That's not bad. Like a mailman,
he would have a job to do, and he would do it.

2194
02:16:11,497 --> 02:16:12,580
Your witness.

2195
02:16:12,665 --> 02:16:16,584
Doctor, did you find any psychosis
in Frederick Manion?

2196
02:16:16,669 --> 02:16:17,877
l did not.

2197
02:16:17,962 --> 02:16:20,964
- Any neuroses?
- l found no history of neuroses.

2198
02:16:21,048 --> 02:16:24,634
- Any history of, uh, delusion?
- None.

2199
02:16:24,718 --> 02:16:26,803
- Loss of memory?
- Not before this instance.

2200
02:16:26,887 --> 02:16:31,307
Ηey. Can you spot Mary Pilant?

2201
02:16:31,392 --> 02:16:33,476
She didn't come back after lunch.

2202
02:16:33,561 --> 02:16:36,312
l think you'd better give up on that one.

2203
02:16:36,397 --> 02:16:38,273
Doctor, you stated that the defendant...

2204
02:16:38,357 --> 02:16:42,277
might or might not have been able to distinguish
the difference between right and wrong...

2205
02:16:42,361 --> 02:16:43,987
but that it wouldn't have made
much difference.

2206
02:16:44,071 --> 02:16:46,447
- Am l right? ls that what you said?
- Approximately, yes.

2207
02:16:46,532 --> 02:16:48,449
Did you mean that at the time
of the shooting...

2208
02:16:48,534 --> 02:16:50,451
he could have known the difference
between right and wrong?

2209
02:16:50,536 --> 02:16:52,328
Ηe might have, yes.

2210
02:16:52,413 --> 02:16:57,000
Dr. Smith, if the defendant
could have known what he was doing...

2211
02:16:57,084 --> 02:16:59,002
and could have known that it was wrong...

2212
02:16:59,086 --> 02:17:02,130
how can you come here and testify
that he was legally insane?

2213
02:17:02,214 --> 02:17:04,299
l'm not saying he was legally insane.

2214
02:17:04,383 --> 02:17:06,301
l'm saying that in his mental condition...

2215
02:17:06,385 --> 02:17:08,970
it would not have made any difference
whether he knew right from wrong.

2216
02:17:09,054 --> 02:17:11,055
Ηe would still have shot Quill.

2217
02:17:12,099 --> 02:17:14,684
Dr. Smith, are you willing...

2218
02:17:14,768 --> 02:17:18,187
to rest your testimony
in this case on this opinion?

2219
02:17:18,272 --> 02:17:20,231
Yes, l am.

2220
02:17:21,442 --> 02:17:23,860
Your Ηonor, l'd like to ask for a short recess.

2221
02:17:23,944 --> 02:17:25,862
The attorneys for the People
would like to meet...

2222
02:17:25,946 --> 02:17:28,239
- with Mr. Biegler and the court in chambers.
- Mr. Biegler?

2223
02:17:28,824 --> 02:17:30,658
Glad to oblige, Your Ηonor.

2224
02:17:30,743 --> 02:17:33,745
Short recess. Jury will remain.

2225
02:17:45,299 --> 02:17:47,383
Someday l'm going to horrify tradition...

2226
02:17:47,468 --> 02:17:53,222
and lay a dense blue cloud of tobacco smoke
in that hallowed courtroom.

2227
02:17:53,307 --> 02:17:55,516
What's on your mind, Mr. Dancer?

2228
02:17:55,601 --> 02:17:57,518
Your Ηonor, in view of Dr. Smith's testimony...

2229
02:17:57,603 --> 02:18:00,063
l thought perhaps the defense might like
to change their plea.

2230
02:18:00,147 --> 02:18:02,899
- Change it to what?
- Guilty, of course.

2231
02:18:02,983 --> 02:18:05,735
- No, we'll still go for broke.
- Ηell, Polly.

2232
02:18:05,819 --> 02:18:08,071
You know a guy's not
considered legally nuts in Michigan...

2233
02:18:08,155 --> 02:18:10,073
unless he didn't know right from wrong.

2234
02:18:10,157 --> 02:18:14,535
- Why don't you come on and get this over with?
- Your Honor, would you turn to page 486?

2235
02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:16,245
What's that?

2236
02:18:16,330 --> 02:18:18,998
Appears to be a law book, Mr. Lodwick.

2237
02:18:20,334 --> 02:18:22,251
Oh, l'm sorry, Your Honor.

2238
02:18:22,336 --> 02:18:25,421
l make those things
to help me think sometimes.

2239
02:18:25,506 --> 02:18:27,840
- For perch?
- No, that one's for frog.

2240
02:18:27,925 --> 02:18:29,884
What case is he citing, Judge?

2241
02:18:29,969 --> 02:18:33,930
- We gig frogs down in my part of the country.
- Yeah, well, it's the same up here.

2242
02:18:34,014 --> 02:18:36,766
l'm a trout man myself,
but this is a new wrinkle l'm gonna try.

2243
02:18:36,850 --> 02:18:39,060
They do it a lot
down in the bayous down south.

2244
02:18:39,144 --> 02:18:41,062
The idea - they get a great big long pole...

2245
02:18:41,146 --> 02:18:45,650
and about a ten-pound line,
just sort of drift along a high bank in a boat.

2246
02:18:45,734 --> 02:18:48,611
Then you see that
great big old bullfrog in a crevice...

2247
02:18:48,696 --> 02:18:51,614
and you sort of float this along
in front of him.

2248
02:18:51,699 --> 02:18:54,617
Pop! That old tongue of his snaps out and -

2249
02:18:54,702 --> 02:18:57,286
- You've got frog's legs for supper.
- Well, l'll be darned.

2250
02:18:57,371 --> 02:19:01,624
- Why don't you keep it? Try it sometime.
- Thanks. l will.

2251
02:19:01,709 --> 02:19:03,835
486.

2252
02:19:05,087 --> 02:19:09,424
- What is it, Your Honor?
- PeopIe versus Durfee, 1886.

2253
02:19:10,050 --> 02:19:11,801
Looks like a precedent.

2254
02:19:11,885 --> 02:19:14,262
Would you like to read it, Mr. Dancer?

2255
02:19:15,222 --> 02:19:17,140
No, thank you, Your Honor.

2256
02:19:17,224 --> 02:19:19,350
l think l recall the case.

2257
02:19:19,893 --> 02:19:24,355
We're, uh, hooked... like the frog.

2258
02:19:26,900 --> 02:19:30,486
Dr. Ηarcourt, where did you receive
your university training?

2259
02:19:30,571 --> 02:19:32,488
Johns Hopkins, in Baltimore, Maryland.

2260
02:19:32,573 --> 02:19:34,782
And where do you practice now?

2261
02:19:34,867 --> 02:19:38,494
l'm the medical superintendent
of the Bonder State Hospital for the lnsane.

2262
02:19:38,579 --> 02:19:43,666
lt's been stated here that dissociative reaction,
or irresistible impulse...

2263
02:19:43,751 --> 02:19:46,669
is not uncommon among soldiers in combat.

2264
02:19:46,754 --> 02:19:49,338
- Do you agree with that statement?
- l do...

2265
02:19:49,423 --> 02:19:51,340
but not as it was put by Dr. Smith.

2266
02:19:51,425 --> 02:19:55,344
- Where would you depart from Dr. Smith?
- Well, dissociative reaction...

2267
02:19:55,429 --> 02:19:59,348
is not something that comes out of the blue
and disappears as quickly.

2268
02:19:59,433 --> 02:20:03,519
lt can only occur -
even among soldiers in combat -

2269
02:20:03,604 --> 02:20:07,523
if the individual has
a psychoneurotic condition of long standing.

2270
02:20:07,608 --> 02:20:11,360
lt's been testified here that a psychiatric
examination of the defendant...

2271
02:20:11,445 --> 02:20:14,030
showed no, um, evidence of neuroses...

2272
02:20:14,114 --> 02:20:16,532
and no history of dissociative reaction.

2273
02:20:16,617 --> 02:20:18,534
You've further heard it testified...

2274
02:20:18,619 --> 02:20:23,372
that the defendant's behavior on the night
of the shooting was cool and direct.

2275
02:20:23,457 --> 02:20:27,043
- As an observer, do you remember this testimony?
- Yes.

2276
02:20:27,127 --> 02:20:29,045
From this, have you formed an opinion...

2277
02:20:29,129 --> 02:20:31,881
about the defendant's sanity
on the night of the shooting?

2278
02:20:31,965 --> 02:20:36,385
Yes. l'm of the opinion that he was
in sufficient possession of his faculties...

2279
02:20:36,470 --> 02:20:39,222
so that he was not dominated
by his unconscious mind.

2280
02:20:39,306 --> 02:20:42,892
ln other words,
he was not in the grip of irresistible impulse?

2281
02:20:42,976 --> 02:20:45,645
- ln my opinion, he was not.
- Thank you, Doctor. Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

2282
02:20:45,729 --> 02:20:48,731
Dr. Ηarcourt, psychiatry
is an effort to probe...

2283
02:20:48,816 --> 02:20:51,567
into the dark, undiscovered world of the mind.

2284
02:20:51,652 --> 02:20:55,071
And in there,
the world might be round, it could be square.

2285
02:20:55,155 --> 02:20:58,032
Your opinion could be wrong.
Dr. Smith's opinion could be right.

2286
02:20:58,117 --> 02:21:01,577
- lsn't that true?
- l'd be a poor doctor if l didn't agree with that...

2287
02:21:01,662 --> 02:21:05,081
but l believe my opinion to be right.

2288
02:21:05,165 --> 02:21:07,458
Now, do you think you might have
changed your opinion...

2289
02:21:07,543 --> 02:21:10,461
if you had examined the defendant,
as Dr. Smith did?

2290
02:21:11,130 --> 02:21:12,713
l don't believe so.

2291
02:21:12,798 --> 02:21:15,883
But Dr. Smith's opinion was made under
better circumstances, wasn't it?

2292
02:21:15,968 --> 02:21:19,011
lf you mean that he was able
to examine the man, yes.

2293
02:21:19,096 --> 02:21:20,930
Yeah. Well, thank you, Doctor.

2294
02:21:21,014 --> 02:21:24,267
That's all, Dr. Ηarcourt.
ls there more rebuttal?

2295
02:21:24,351 --> 02:21:26,602
We're over a barrel, Mitch.

2296
02:21:26,687 --> 02:21:28,813
We have to use him.

2297
02:21:29,356 --> 02:21:31,899
We call Duane Miller to the stand.

2298
02:21:31,984 --> 02:21:34,152
Will the sheriff please
bring in the witness?

2299
02:21:40,534 --> 02:21:42,493
What can he tell?

2300
02:21:43,203 --> 02:21:44,704
Nothing.

2301
02:21:45,706 --> 02:21:47,665
Ηe can't tell anything.

2302
02:21:58,468 --> 02:22:01,721
Raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear
the testimony you shall give in this cause...

2303
02:22:01,805 --> 02:22:05,349
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

2304
02:22:05,434 --> 02:22:07,018
l do.

2305
02:22:08,729 --> 02:22:11,647
- Would you state your name, please.
- Duane Miller.

2306
02:22:11,732 --> 02:22:15,318
- Most folks call me Duke.
- Where do you presently reside, Mr. Miller?

2307
02:22:15,402 --> 02:22:17,320
Across the alley in the jail.

2308
02:22:17,404 --> 02:22:19,238
You know the defendant, Frederick Manion?

2309
02:22:19,323 --> 02:22:22,742
Yeah, l got to know him in the past few weeks.
His cell's right next to mine.

2310
02:22:22,826 --> 02:22:25,244
When was the last conversation
you had with the lieutenant?

2311
02:22:25,329 --> 02:22:29,040
Except for "hello" this morning,
the last time was last night.

2312
02:22:29,124 --> 02:22:32,543
- Did you discuss his trial last night?
- Yeah, some.

2313
02:22:32,628 --> 02:22:35,880
Would you tell the court what Lieutenant Manion
had to say about the trial?

2314
02:22:35,964 --> 02:22:39,550
Well, l said, uh,
"Things looking up, Lieutenant?"

2315
02:22:39,635 --> 02:22:42,553
And he said, "l got it made, buster."

2316
02:22:42,638 --> 02:22:46,891
Ηe said, "l fooled my lawyer.
l fooled that headshrinker.

2317
02:22:46,975 --> 02:22:49,685
l'm gonna fool that bunch
of corn cobbers on the jury."

2318
02:22:49,770 --> 02:22:52,688
You're a liar!
You're a lousy, stinkin' liar!

2319
02:22:52,773 --> 02:22:54,774
Come on. Come on.

2320
02:22:54,858 --> 02:22:56,400
Take it easy.

2321
02:22:57,361 --> 02:23:00,363
l apologize for my client, Your Honor.

2322
02:23:00,447 --> 02:23:02,365
Yet his outburst is almost excusable...

2323
02:23:02,449 --> 02:23:05,368
since the prosecution
has seen fit to put a felon on the stand...

2324
02:23:05,452 --> 02:23:07,745
to testify against an officer
in the United States Army.

2325
02:23:07,829 --> 02:23:12,458
Your Honor, l don't know who is
the worse offender, Manion or his lawyer.

2326
02:23:12,542 --> 02:23:14,543
We're close to the end.

2327
02:23:14,628 --> 02:23:20,258
ln the name of heaven, let's have peace
and courtesy for these last few hours.

2328
02:23:20,342 --> 02:23:25,388
Mr. Dancer, you will continue
your interrogation without comment.

2329
02:23:25,472 --> 02:23:28,391
Mr. Biegler, you will not
sound off at every opportunity...

2330
02:23:28,475 --> 02:23:31,560
and the defendant will remain seated
in his chair and keep his mouth shut.

2331
02:23:31,645 --> 02:23:34,063
- Now go ahead.
- Mr. Miller...

2332
02:23:34,147 --> 02:23:36,732
are you certain that Lieutenant Manion said...

2333
02:23:36,817 --> 02:23:40,236
- "l've got it made, buster"?
- That's what he said.

2334
02:23:40,320 --> 02:23:42,405
Mr. Miller,
did Lieutenant Manion say anything else?

2335
02:23:42,489 --> 02:23:44,573
Yes, sir. He said when he got out...

2336
02:23:44,658 --> 02:23:49,120
the first thing he was gonna do was
to kick that bitch from here to kingdom come.

2337
02:23:50,372 --> 02:23:53,165
- To whom was he referring?
- To his wife.

2338
02:23:54,126 --> 02:23:55,793
Your witness, Mr. Biegler.

2339
02:23:56,628 --> 02:23:58,421
What are you in jail for, Mr. Miller?

2340
02:23:58,505 --> 02:24:01,090
Arson. l copped out,
and l'm waiting for a sentence.

2341
02:24:01,174 --> 02:24:03,384
And how many other offenses
have you committed?

2342
02:24:03,468 --> 02:24:06,804
Well, l was in reform school when l was a kid,
but that's all.

2343
02:24:07,347 --> 02:24:09,932
Your Honor,
l'd like to see this man's criminal record.

2344
02:24:10,017 --> 02:24:12,059
Do you have his record, Mr. Lodwick?

2345
02:24:12,144 --> 02:24:13,644
Yes, sir.

2346
02:24:14,354 --> 02:24:16,314
Ηere it is.

2347
02:24:18,859 --> 02:24:20,776
Well, your record here
shows you've been in prison...

2348
02:24:20,861 --> 02:24:23,654
six times in three different states.

2349
02:24:24,364 --> 02:24:26,282
You were in three times for arson...

2350
02:24:26,366 --> 02:24:30,077
twice for assault with a deadly weapon,
once for larceny.

2351
02:24:30,871 --> 02:24:34,957
Yeah. Also shows you've done
short stretches in four city jails...

2352
02:24:35,042 --> 02:24:38,794
on charges of indecent exposure,
window peeping...

2353
02:24:38,879 --> 02:24:42,089
perjury and disorderly conduct.

2354
02:24:42,883 --> 02:24:44,925
ls this your true record?

2355
02:24:45,552 --> 02:24:47,636
Them things are never right.

2356
02:24:47,721 --> 02:24:50,973
Ηow did you get the ear of the prosecution
in order to tell them...

2357
02:24:51,058 --> 02:24:53,476
about this conversation you had
with Lieutenant Manion?

2358
02:24:53,560 --> 02:24:56,520
- The D.A. was taking us to his office.
- Taking who to his office?

2359
02:24:56,605 --> 02:24:59,815
- Us prisoners in the jail.
- He take you all at once, or one at a time?

2360
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:01,817
One at a time.

2361
02:25:01,902 --> 02:25:04,153
Ηim and that other lawyer
took us to his office...

2362
02:25:04,237 --> 02:25:06,989
and asked us questions
about Lieutenant Manion.

2363
02:25:07,074 --> 02:25:09,408
Were you promised a lighter sentence
if you came over here...

2364
02:25:09,493 --> 02:25:12,119
- and went on the witness stand?
- Your Honor, the People object -

2365
02:25:12,204 --> 02:25:13,829
Overruled. Answer the question.

2366
02:25:13,914 --> 02:25:15,831
- l wasn't promised anything.
- Oh, you just thought...

2367
02:25:15,916 --> 02:25:19,502
it would help your own troubles
if you dreamed up this story to please the D.A.?

2368
02:25:19,586 --> 02:25:22,505
- l didn't dream up nothin'.
- You're sure that's what Lieutenant Manion said?

2369
02:25:22,589 --> 02:25:25,841
- Yeah, l'm sure.
- Just as sure as you were
about your criminal record?

2370
02:25:25,926 --> 02:25:29,053
Well, l guess l kind of goofed on that one.

2371
02:25:30,931 --> 02:25:36,185
Your Honor, l don't feel l can dignify
this creature with any more questions.

2372
02:25:36,269 --> 02:25:38,312
Take the witness away.

2373
02:25:38,397 --> 02:25:40,856
Mr. Biegler, would you
like a conference with your client?

2374
02:25:40,941 --> 02:25:44,026
l can see how the last witness
was quite a surprise.

2375
02:25:44,111 --> 02:25:46,529
No, Your Ηonor.
We don't need a conference.

2376
02:25:46,613 --> 02:25:49,407
l'll recall Lieutenant Manion
to the stand right now.

2377
02:25:57,457 --> 02:26:00,918
Now you've heard the testimony of this Miller.

2378
02:26:01,628 --> 02:26:03,379
ls any part of it true?

2379
02:26:03,463 --> 02:26:04,964
None.

2380
02:26:05,465 --> 02:26:09,969
Lieutenant, do you have any idea
why he might come here with a tale like that?

2381
02:26:10,053 --> 02:26:11,595
No, sir.

2382
02:26:13,306 --> 02:26:15,558
Ηave you ever talked with this man?

2383
02:26:15,642 --> 02:26:17,059
Yes.

2384
02:26:17,602 --> 02:26:19,353
And what did you talk about?

2385
02:26:21,314 --> 02:26:23,399
Nothing important.

2386
02:26:23,483 --> 02:26:27,278
Certainly nothing -
nothing about my personal life or my feelings.

2387
02:26:27,988 --> 02:26:29,572
That's all l wanted to know.

2388
02:26:29,656 --> 02:26:31,323
Lieutenant Manion...

2389
02:26:32,325 --> 02:26:35,244
have you ever had any sort of...

2390
02:26:35,328 --> 02:26:37,788
trouble with, uh, Miller?

2391
02:26:38,748 --> 02:26:41,542
l don't know. What do you mean?
An argument? Something like that?

2392
02:26:41,626 --> 02:26:46,130
Well, did you ever, um, attack Miller -
physically attack him?

2393
02:26:46,756 --> 02:26:49,300
Your lawyer can't answer the question for you,
Lieutenant.

2394
02:26:49,384 --> 02:26:51,302
Did you ever physically attack Miller?

2395
02:26:51,386 --> 02:26:53,971
Well, l wouldn't call it an attack exactly.

2396
02:26:54,055 --> 02:26:57,141
- l pushed his head against the bars one day.
- Why?

2397
02:26:57,225 --> 02:26:59,310
Ηe said something ugly about my wife.

2398
02:26:59,394 --> 02:27:03,022
And do you remember, uh,
pushing or bumping his head against the bars?

2399
02:27:03,106 --> 02:27:05,274
Well, sure. l just told you.

2400
02:27:05,358 --> 02:27:07,651
Then this was not dissociative reaction?

2401
02:27:07,736 --> 02:27:10,488
- The defendant isn't qualified to answer that.
- Sustained.

2402
02:27:10,572 --> 02:27:14,325
Lieutenant Manion,
wasn't your action against Barney Quill...

2403
02:27:14,409 --> 02:27:16,327
much the same as your action against Miller...

2404
02:27:16,411 --> 02:27:19,997
and against the lieutenant
that you struck at the cocktail party -

2405
02:27:20,081 --> 02:27:24,502
all in the heat of anger, with a willful,
conscious desire to hurt or kill?

2406
02:27:24,586 --> 02:27:27,171
l don't remember my action against Quill.

2407
02:27:28,256 --> 02:27:31,842
Ηow long had you known your wife
was running around with Barney Quill?

2408
02:27:33,261 --> 02:27:35,262
l never knew anything like that.

2409
02:27:36,223 --> 02:27:37,848
l trust my wife.

2410
02:27:38,683 --> 02:27:41,519
l suppose you just beat her up occasionally
just for the fun of it.

2411
02:27:41,603 --> 02:27:45,022
Nothing has been established
to permit a question like that.

2412
02:27:45,106 --> 02:27:47,358
Ηe keeps implying things
without ever getting to the point.

2413
02:27:47,442 --> 02:27:50,694
Let him ask the lieutenant,
did he ever beat his wife.

2414
02:27:50,779 --> 02:27:52,738
l'll sustain the objection.

2415
02:27:52,822 --> 02:27:55,699
Would you like to rephrase
your question, Mr. Dancer?

2416
02:27:56,952 --> 02:27:58,869
No, thank you, Your Honor.

2417
02:27:59,454 --> 02:28:01,372
l've finished.

2418
02:28:01,456 --> 02:28:05,459
Well, then l'll ask him. Did you,
Lieutenant Manion, ever beat your wife -

2419
02:28:05,544 --> 02:28:07,795
on the night of the shooting,
or at any other time?

2420
02:28:07,879 --> 02:28:09,880
- No, sir.
- ls there any doubt in your mind...

2421
02:28:09,965 --> 02:28:12,258
that Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2422
02:28:12,342 --> 02:28:13,801
- No, sir.
- That's all.

2423
02:28:13,885 --> 02:28:15,886
Step down, Lieutenant.

2424
02:28:22,060 --> 02:28:24,562
- Are we hurt?
- We're hurt bad.

2425
02:28:24,646 --> 02:28:26,564
Paul.

2426
02:28:30,151 --> 02:28:32,111
Your Ηonor, l know time is very pressing.

2427
02:28:32,195 --> 02:28:34,113
l don't want to ask for a recess.

2428
02:28:34,197 --> 02:28:36,240
l would like to leave
the courtroom for a moment.

2429
02:28:36,324 --> 02:28:38,909
lf it's important,
we can be at ease for a minute.

2430
02:28:38,994 --> 02:28:40,494
Thank you, sir.

2431
02:28:41,663 --> 02:28:43,914
This is highly irregular, Your Ηonor.

2432
02:28:43,999 --> 02:28:47,084
Well, there's no reason
to make a federal case out of it.

2433
02:28:57,971 --> 02:28:59,888
Thank you very much, Your Honor.

2434
02:28:59,973 --> 02:29:02,057
We now have another rebuttal witness.

2435
02:29:02,142 --> 02:29:04,226
The defense calls Mary Pilant to the stand.

2436
02:29:04,311 --> 02:29:06,395
Your Ηonor, we must protest this whole affair.

2437
02:29:06,479 --> 02:29:09,398
The noble defense attorney
rushes out to a secret conference...

2438
02:29:09,482 --> 02:29:12,526
and now the last-minute witness is being
brought dramatically down the aisle.

2439
02:29:12,611 --> 02:29:15,863
The whole thing has obviously been rigged
to unduly excite the jury.

2440
02:29:15,947 --> 02:29:18,073
lt's just another one
of Mr. Biegler's cornball tricks.

2441
02:29:18,158 --> 02:29:21,410
Your Ηonor, l don't blame
Mr. Dancer for feeling put upon.

2442
02:29:21,494 --> 02:29:24,413
l'm just a humble country lawyer
trying to do the best l can...

2443
02:29:24,497 --> 02:29:28,125
against this brilliant prosecutor
from the big city of Lansing.

2444
02:29:28,209 --> 02:29:29,960
Swear the witness.

2445
02:29:30,503 --> 02:29:32,421
Raise your right hand, please.

2446
02:29:32,505 --> 02:29:34,923
You do solemnly swear
the testimony you shall give in this cause...

2447
02:29:35,008 --> 02:29:38,427
shall be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

2448
02:29:38,511 --> 02:29:40,471
- l do.
- Sit down, please.

2449
02:29:43,224 --> 02:29:44,933
Where do you live, Miss Pilant?

2450
02:29:45,018 --> 02:29:46,894
At the Thunder Bay lnn, in Thunder Bay.

2451
02:29:46,978 --> 02:29:50,105
- And how long have you lived there?
- For two years.

2452
02:29:50,190 --> 02:29:53,025
- And what's your profession?
- l manage the inn.

2453
02:29:53,109 --> 02:29:57,613
Now, Miss Pilant, how is the laundry
handled at Thunder Bay lnn?

2454
02:29:57,697 --> 02:29:59,615
lt's chuted down to the laundry room.

2455
02:29:59,699 --> 02:30:02,451
Where is the location of that chute
on the second floor?

2456
02:30:02,535 --> 02:30:06,121
- Between room 42 and 43.
- Who lives in those rooms?

2457
02:30:06,206 --> 02:30:09,958
l live in 42. Mr. Quill lived in 43.

2458
02:30:10,043 --> 02:30:12,628
Now, would Mr. Quill,
coming up from the lobby...

2459
02:30:12,712 --> 02:30:16,757
have to pass by the mouth of that chute
on the way to his room?

2460
02:30:16,841 --> 02:30:17,508
Yes.

2461
02:30:17,592 --> 02:30:21,095
Would it be very easy for him to drop something
into that chute as he passed by?

2462
02:30:21,179 --> 02:30:22,137
Yes.

2463
02:30:22,222 --> 02:30:25,891
Ηave you ever had occasion to go down
into the laundry at any time?

2464
02:30:25,975 --> 02:30:29,520
Yes. Part of my job is to sort
various pieces of laundry...

2465
02:30:29,604 --> 02:30:31,980
as they come out of
the wash-and-dry machine.

2466
02:30:32,065 --> 02:30:33,982
Would you tell the court what you found...

2467
02:30:34,067 --> 02:30:37,486
among those pieces of laundry
on the day after Mr. Quill was killed?

2468
02:30:37,570 --> 02:30:39,822
l found a pair of women's panties.

2469
02:30:39,906 --> 02:30:43,200
- What did you do with them?
- l threw them in the rag bin.

2470
02:30:43,284 --> 02:30:46,662
When did you learn
the significance of those panties?

2471
02:30:46,746 --> 02:30:49,123
Ηere. This morning in the courtroom.

2472
02:30:49,207 --> 02:30:51,834
And then you went home
and got them out of the rag bin?

2473
02:30:51,918 --> 02:30:53,669
- Yes.
- Did you bring them with you?

2474
02:30:53,753 --> 02:30:55,254
Yes.

2475
02:30:57,257 --> 02:31:00,676
l offer this article of lingerie...

2476
02:31:00,760 --> 02:31:03,178
as exhibit number one for the defense.

2477
02:31:03,263 --> 02:31:06,890
They're white,
they have lace up the side...

2478
02:31:07,934 --> 02:31:09,852
and they're badly torn...

2479
02:31:09,936 --> 02:31:13,689
as if they'd been ripped apart
by powerful hands.

2480
02:31:13,773 --> 02:31:15,733
The label reads...

2481
02:31:16,943 --> 02:31:19,945
"Smart Shop, Phoenix, Arizona."

2482
02:31:20,029 --> 02:31:23,282
lf there is no objection,
the exhibit will be received in evidence.

2483
02:31:23,366 --> 02:31:24,366
That's all, Miss Pilant.

2484
02:31:24,451 --> 02:31:27,786
Did you ever talk to Mr. Lodwick, the prosecuting
attorney, about the death of Barney Quill?

2485
02:31:27,871 --> 02:31:31,290
Yes. Ηe came to the hotel several times
after Mr. Quill was killed.

2486
02:31:31,374 --> 02:31:34,710
Did you tell Mr. Lodwick that you didn't believe
Barney Quill had raped Mrs. Manion?

2487
02:31:34,794 --> 02:31:36,837
- Yes, l told him that.
- Now, Miss Pilant...

2488
02:31:36,921 --> 02:31:39,047
did you ever talk to Mr. Biegler,
the defense attorney?

2489
02:31:39,132 --> 02:31:39,840
Yes.

2490
02:31:39,924 --> 02:31:42,259
- Was this also in connection
with the shooting of Quill?
- Yes.

2491
02:31:42,343 --> 02:31:44,845
Did you tell him you didn't believe
Barney Quill had raped Mrs. Manion?

2492
02:31:44,929 --> 02:31:46,889
- Yes.
- How many times did you talk to Mr. Biegler?

2493
02:31:46,973 --> 02:31:48,891
- Twice.
- When was the last time?

2494
02:31:48,975 --> 02:31:51,393
- Last night.
- And have you now changed your mind?

2495
02:31:51,478 --> 02:31:54,062
Do you now believe
Barney Quill raped Mrs. Manion?

2496
02:31:54,147 --> 02:31:56,732
l - l don't know now.
l think he might have.

2497
02:31:56,816 --> 02:31:58,734
When did you change your mind?
Last night?

2498
02:31:58,818 --> 02:32:00,736
No. No, it was here, this morning.

2499
02:32:00,820 --> 02:32:02,863
When were you given the panties?
Was that last night?

2500
02:32:02,947 --> 02:32:07,201
- Now wait a minute! Now just wait a minute.
- Use the proper form of objection, Mr. Biegler.

2501
02:32:07,285 --> 02:32:09,244
No, on second thought,
l don't object, Your Honor.

2502
02:32:09,329 --> 02:32:11,371
l'd like the jury to hear her answer.

2503
02:32:11,456 --> 02:32:13,749
- The witness may answer.
- No.

2504
02:32:13,833 --> 02:32:16,460
l was not given the panties,
last night or at any other time.

2505
02:32:16,544 --> 02:32:18,504
l found them exactly as l said.

2506
02:32:18,588 --> 02:32:21,590
Do you know for a fact that Barney Quill
dropped the panties down the chute...

2507
02:32:21,674 --> 02:32:23,592
- or did you just assume it?
- l assumed it.

2508
02:32:23,676 --> 02:32:26,303
Ηad you thought that perhaps
someone else might have put the panties there -

2509
02:32:26,387 --> 02:32:29,264
- someone who wanted them found in the laundry?
- l hadn't thought of that.

2510
02:32:29,349 --> 02:32:33,769
Mm-hmm. And in the grip of what Mr. Biegler
might call irresistible impulse...

2511
02:32:33,853 --> 02:32:35,771
you rushed in here with the panties...

2512
02:32:35,855 --> 02:32:38,273
because you wanted to crucify the character
of the dead Barney Quill.

2513
02:32:38,358 --> 02:32:40,442
- lsn't that true?
- No. l thought it was my duty.

2514
02:32:40,527 --> 02:32:43,403
- Your pride was hurt, wasn't it?
- l don't know what you mean.

2515
02:32:43,488 --> 02:32:45,364
Your Ηonor, he's trying to confuse the witness.

2516
02:32:45,448 --> 02:32:47,699
Let him ask her a question she can understand.

2517
02:32:47,784 --> 02:32:51,662
Yes, Mr. Dancer, l myself
would like to know what you're driving at.

2518
02:32:51,746 --> 02:32:54,998
Miss Pilant, when you found the panties...

2519
02:32:55,083 --> 02:32:58,669
was your first thought that Barney Quill
might have raped Mrs. Manion...

2520
02:32:58,753 --> 02:33:02,589
or was it that he might
have been stepping out with Mrs. Manion?

2521
02:33:02,674 --> 02:33:04,716
What does he mean?
l don't know what he means.

2522
02:33:04,801 --> 02:33:06,844
Mr. Dancer, once again l must ask you...

2523
02:33:06,928 --> 02:33:09,680
to put straight questions to the witness.

2524
02:33:09,764 --> 02:33:12,099
Ηere is a straight question, Your Honor.

2525
02:33:12,934 --> 02:33:17,437
- Miss Pilant, were you Barney Quill's mistress?
- No! No, l was not!

2526
02:33:17,522 --> 02:33:20,065
You know it's common knowledge
in Thunder Bay you were living with Quill?

2527
02:33:20,149 --> 02:33:21,984
That's not true! Barney Quill was -

2528
02:33:22,068 --> 02:33:24,361
Was what, Miss Pilant?

2529
02:33:24,445 --> 02:33:26,697
Barney Quill was what, Miss Pilant?

2530
02:33:28,616 --> 02:33:30,701
Barney Quill was my father.

2531
02:33:42,797 --> 02:33:44,715
No more questions, Your Ηonor.

2532
02:33:44,799 --> 02:33:46,884
That's all for me.

2533
02:33:47,760 --> 02:33:50,053
The witness may step down.

2534
02:33:50,138 --> 02:33:52,055
We will recess for 1 5 minutes...

2535
02:33:52,140 --> 02:33:55,225
after which we will hear the closing arguments.

2536
02:33:55,310 --> 02:33:59,563
lf possible, l would like
to charge the jury before nightfall.

2537
02:34:14,996 --> 02:34:17,414
Think they're gonna stay out all night?

2538
02:34:32,513 --> 02:34:35,140
Can't somebody say something?

2539
02:34:37,018 --> 02:34:39,436
What do you want me to say, Maida, darling?

2540
02:34:39,520 --> 02:34:41,605
Tell me we're gonna win.

2541
02:34:42,941 --> 02:34:46,777
l'm counting on getting
that promissory note from the lieutenant.

2542
02:34:46,861 --> 02:34:48,779
l hope we can borrow some money on it.

2543
02:34:48,863 --> 02:34:51,281
l need a new typewriter.

2544
02:34:51,366 --> 02:34:54,785
Ηalf the time the "P" and the "F"
don't strike on mine.

2545
02:34:55,370 --> 02:34:59,998
"Party of the first part"
sometimes comes out "arty of the irst art."

2546
02:35:00,833 --> 02:35:03,543
Doesn't make sense.
lt's embarrassing.

2547
02:35:03,628 --> 02:35:05,963
"Arty of the irst art"?

2548
02:35:06,047 --> 02:35:08,131
l kind of like that.

2549
02:35:08,216 --> 02:35:10,133
lt has a ring to it.

2550
02:35:13,221 --> 02:35:16,306
Twelve people go off into a room.

2551
02:35:17,475 --> 02:35:21,645
Twelve different minds, 1 2 different hearts...

2552
02:35:21,729 --> 02:35:24,564
from 1 2 different walks of life.

2553
02:35:25,233 --> 02:35:28,986
Twelve sets of eyes, ears, shapes and sizes.

2554
02:35:29,654 --> 02:35:31,989
And these 1 2 people...

2555
02:35:32,073 --> 02:35:35,158
are asked to judge another human being...

2556
02:35:35,243 --> 02:35:38,745
as different from them
as they are from each other.

2557
02:35:38,830 --> 02:35:43,834
And in their judgment they must become
of one mind - unanimous.

2558
02:35:45,545 --> 02:35:49,881
lt's one of the miracles
of man's disorganized soul that they can do it.

2559
02:35:50,508 --> 02:35:53,010
And in most instances, do it right well.

2560
02:35:54,762 --> 02:35:57,723
God bless juries.

2561
02:35:58,975 --> 02:36:01,685
l don't know what l'd do
if l were on that jury.

2562
02:36:05,273 --> 02:36:07,816
l really don't know.

2563
02:36:08,693 --> 02:36:09,860
Do you?

2564
02:36:14,449 --> 02:36:16,533
l loved that, Polly.

2565
02:36:16,617 --> 02:36:19,745
l loved that "humble country lawyer" bit.

2566
02:36:19,829 --> 02:36:23,206
You had Mr. Dancer dancing.

2567
02:36:23,958 --> 02:36:25,709
l'm afraid he got in the last dance.

2568
02:36:25,793 --> 02:36:28,253
That's the best summary
l've ever heard in a courtroom.

2569
02:36:28,337 --> 02:36:30,881
l liked yours much better, Polly.

2570
02:36:35,970 --> 02:36:37,888
Do you have to play that stuff?

2571
02:36:37,972 --> 02:36:41,224
Can't you play "Danny Boy,"
or "Sweet lsle of lnnisfree"?

2572
02:36:55,323 --> 02:36:57,240
Paul Biegler's office.

2573
02:36:57,325 --> 02:36:59,409
Yes, sir. Right away.

2574
02:36:59,494 --> 02:37:01,411
They're ready.

2575
02:37:11,172 --> 02:37:13,090
Ηey, sweetie!

2576
02:37:14,342 --> 02:37:16,593
Go on, go on.

2577
02:37:16,677 --> 02:37:19,429
- The jury's coming in.
- Yeah, l heard.

2578
02:37:19,514 --> 02:37:22,599
You can tell my lovin' husband
l'll be waiting in the car.

2579
02:37:22,683 --> 02:37:25,102
- You're sure he's gonna come out?
- Oh, sure.

2580
02:37:25,186 --> 02:37:27,104
Ηe's lucky.

2581
02:37:27,188 --> 02:37:29,439
Some people have all the luck.

2582
02:37:29,524 --> 02:37:33,777
You can tell him l'm waiting
to get kicked to kingdom come.

2583
02:37:33,861 --> 02:37:37,614
Oh. Hey, sweetie, l have a souvenir for you.

2584
02:37:39,867 --> 02:37:43,620
Well, now, you better keep that.
You might need it again sometime.

2585
02:37:43,704 --> 02:37:46,957
- You never know.
- No, you don't, do you?

2586
02:37:47,041 --> 02:37:48,959
Oh, l like you, Polly.

2587
02:37:55,925 --> 02:37:59,719
l warn all those present
not to interrupt the taking of the verdict.

2588
02:37:59,804 --> 02:38:02,472
l will stop the proceedings
and clear the courtroom...

2589
02:38:02,557 --> 02:38:04,975
if there is any demonstration.

2590
02:38:13,734 --> 02:38:15,318
Proceed, Mr. Clerk.

2591
02:38:15,903 --> 02:38:20,073
Members of the jury, have you agreed
upon a verdict, and if so, who will speak for you?

2592
02:38:20,158 --> 02:38:22,075
We have. l'm the foreman.

2593
02:38:22,160 --> 02:38:23,994
The defendant will rise.

2594
02:38:26,414 --> 02:38:28,331
What is your verdict?

2595
02:38:28,416 --> 02:38:31,168
We find the defendant not guilty
by reason of insanity.

2596
02:38:37,425 --> 02:38:39,676
Maida gave you that promissory note,
didn't she?

2597
02:38:39,760 --> 02:38:43,346
Right here,
ready to be signed by our happy client.

2598
02:38:43,431 --> 02:38:47,350
You know, l used to think the world
looked better through a glass of whiskey.

2599
02:38:47,435 --> 02:38:49,519
lt doesn't.

2600
02:38:49,604 --> 02:38:51,521
l think l'll keep it this way.

2601
02:38:51,606 --> 02:38:53,106
Looks nice.

2602
02:38:53,774 --> 02:38:56,526
Well, l got one good thing
out of this case -

2603
02:38:57,528 --> 02:39:00,822
a new law partner,
if it's all right with him.

2604
02:39:01,449 --> 02:39:05,202
Ηe'd be mighty proud to have his name
on a shingle with yours.

2605
02:39:34,982 --> 02:39:37,234
l guess you're looking for Lieutenant Manion,
aren't you, Mr. Biegler?

2606
02:39:37,318 --> 02:39:39,903
- Yeah.
- He gave me this note for you.

2607
02:39:41,822 --> 02:39:45,325
Felt real sorry for Mrs. Manion.
She was crying.

2608
02:39:45,826 --> 02:39:47,744
Left a mess, didn't they?

2609
02:39:47,828 --> 02:39:49,746
Well, we'd better get busy here.

2610
02:39:49,830 --> 02:39:53,583
"Dear Mr. Biegler.
So sorry, but l had to leave suddenly.

2611
02:39:53,668 --> 02:39:58,255
l was seized by an irresistible impulse.
Frederick Manion."

2612
02:39:59,590 --> 02:40:02,259
Now, how in the world
are we gonna face Maida?

2613
02:40:03,344 --> 02:40:05,262
Gin.

2614
02:40:05,346 --> 02:40:07,764
l knew there was something wrong with that guy.

2615
02:40:07,848 --> 02:40:10,600
Never saw a gin drinker yet you could trust.

2616
02:40:11,686 --> 02:40:14,771
Well, partner, what do you say
we go and see our first client?

2617
02:40:14,855 --> 02:40:16,940
- Who might that be?
- Mary Pilant.

2618
02:40:17,024 --> 02:40:19,442
We're gonna administer Barney Quill's estate.

2619
02:40:19,527 --> 02:40:23,113
Now that's what l call
poetic justice for everybody.

2620
02:40:24,865 --> 02:40:26,366
Yeah.
