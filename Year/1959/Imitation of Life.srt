1
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:38,887
Susie! Susie!

2
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,804
Susie!

3
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:49,774
<i>The most sensational...</i>

4
00:02:56,649 --> 00:02:58,981
Susie!

5
00:03:00,453 --> 00:03:05,652
Pardon me. Have you
seen a little girl
in a blue sunsuit?

6
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:07,659
Oh!

7
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:11,094
Oh, I'm awfully sorry.
No harm done.

8
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:14,792
I'm looking for my daughter.
Have you seen a little girl
all by herself?

9
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:17,335
No, but if you'll...
She's lost and I...
Susie!

10
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:19,428
Relax, lady.
Take it easy.
Susie!

11
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:21,496
The easiest way
to find Susie
is to go to the police.

12
00:03:21,574 --> 00:03:24,338
Well, where are the police?

13
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,708
Right there.

14
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:30,510
Right where?
Right down there
under the pier.

15
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:32,608
<i>You're it!</i>

16
00:03:32,685 --> 00:03:35,119
<i>Come, children.</i>

17
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:38,054
You hear me, Sarah Jane?
Hot dogs!

18
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:43,027
Oh, boy!
Come on! Boy!
Hot dogs!

19
00:03:43,095 --> 00:03:48,727
It might be the noise of
that old ocean, but it seems
to me I didn't hear thank you.

20
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:51,326
I was too hungry.
Thank <i>you!</i>
Thank <i>you!</i>

21
00:03:51,404 --> 00:03:53,497
Honey, you gonna be all right.
I reported you.

22
00:03:53,573 --> 00:03:56,201
Come on, Sarah Jane!
No, you're gonna stay
right here.

23
00:03:56,275 --> 00:03:59,005
Oh!
Else how
your mama gonna find you?

24
00:03:59,078 --> 00:04:02,536
<i>Susie! Oh, Susie!</i>

25
00:04:02,615 --> 00:04:06,278
Oh, my baby! Oh,
I thought you were lost.

26
00:04:06,352 --> 00:04:08,684
Thank you, Officer.
Thank you very much.

27
00:04:08,754 --> 00:04:12,155
And thank you for being
so kind, Mrs...
Johnson.

28
00:04:12,224 --> 00:04:15,955
I'm Lora Meredith.
I've never been
so frightened in my life.

29
00:04:16,028 --> 00:04:19,293
One moment I had her,
and the next moment
she was gone.

30
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:22,300
Thank Mrs. Johnson
for being so nice.
Thank you!

31
00:04:22,368 --> 00:04:25,599
And say good-bye
to the little girl.
Good-bye? Now?

32
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:29,072
But, darling, we have
to go back to the city.
But we wanna play!

33
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:31,371
Please?
Please, Mommy,
please!

34
00:04:31,444 --> 00:04:34,607
Oh, all right.
But only for a little while.

35
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,740
Come on, Sarah Jane!

36
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:39,808
You're it!
<i>You're it!</i>

37
00:04:39,885 --> 00:04:42,854
You're it!
You're it!

38
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,018
Susie doesn't have many
children to play with
where we live.

39
00:04:48,094 --> 00:04:51,461
I guess Sarah Jane's
kind of lonesome too.

40
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,090
They got along fine
right off.

41
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:58,102
Sarah Jane's a lovely child.
How long have you
taken care of her?

42
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:00,331
All her life.

43
00:05:00,406 --> 00:05:02,840
Oh, I wish I had someone
to look after Susie.

44
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:07,106
A maid to live in?
Someone to take care
of your little girl?

45
00:05:07,179 --> 00:05:09,579
A strong, healthy,
settled-down woman...

46
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:12,584
who eats like a bird
and doesn't care
if she gets no time off...

47
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:14,745
and will work real cheap?

48
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,948
Well, yes, if one exists.
Oh, someday.

49
00:05:18,024 --> 00:05:21,050
Why not today?
I'm available.

50
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:23,891
You?
Me. Annie Johnson.

51
00:05:23,963 --> 00:05:27,558
You mean you'd
consider leaving that
lovely little girl?

52
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,195
Oh, I wouldn't be leaving her.
My baby goes where I go.

53
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:37,237
Sarah Jane
is <i>your</i> child?

54
00:05:37,309 --> 00:05:40,676
Yes, ma'am.
It surprises most people.

55
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:44,375
Sarah Jane favors her daddy.
He was practically white.

56
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,941
He left before she was born.

57
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:50,546
Seems to me, Miss Meredith,
I'm just right for you.

58
00:05:50,623 --> 00:05:54,582
You wouldn't have to pay
no wages. Just let me come
and do for you.

59
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:00,155
I couldn't do that.
I'd have to pay you,
and I... can't now.

60
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:03,999
Susie!

61
00:06:08,941 --> 00:06:11,637
I ought to knock
your blocks off.

62
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,646
I'll take care of it,
mister. I'll wham
the hides off both of them.

63
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:17,842
<i>Susie! What are</i>
<i>you doing?</i>
About time you showed up!

64
00:06:17,917 --> 00:06:19,885
<i>If your husband can't keep</i>
<i>these brats in line...</i>

65
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:23,888
No use talking to her.
She not only spoils them,
she goes around losing them.

66
00:06:23,956 --> 00:06:25,924
I don't know what
this is all about.

67
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:29,950
Mommy, look at his stomach.
It went up and down.
It was so funny.

68
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:32,190
He took our picture.
Will you send me one?

69
00:06:32,264 --> 00:06:34,198
Me too.
Sure. Where?

70
00:06:34,266 --> 00:06:38,362
<i>Send it to Susan Meredith,</i>
<i>450 Prescott Place,</i>
<i>Apartment 32.</i>

71
00:06:38,437 --> 00:06:40,701
Never mind, dear.
See? I remembered.

72
00:06:40,773 --> 00:06:44,038
Thank you.
And send her one too.
Where do you live, Sarah Jane?

73
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:48,513
Where do I live...
No place.

74
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:51,379
We'll find a place
come night, honey.

75
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,578
Come on, darling, we have
to go. Say good-bye to
Sarah Jane and Mrs. Johnson.

76
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:57,281
Good-bye.
It was very nice
meeting you.

77
00:06:57,356 --> 00:07:00,291
Same here.
And good luck,
Miss Meredith.

78
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:03,886
Mommy, I'm tired.
I know, baby.

79
00:07:03,963 --> 00:07:07,558
<i>I know.</i>
<i>I wanna go home too!</i>

80
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:10,431
Come on, honey.

81
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:13,028
Thank you.
<i>Mrs. Johnson.</i>

82
00:07:14,406 --> 00:07:17,239
Oh. Oh, come on.

83
00:07:34,326 --> 00:07:36,317
First.

84
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:39,694
I don't like
to mention it again, but
you must understand that...

85
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:41,699
this arrangement
can only be for tonight.

86
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:43,894
Oh, I understand,
Miss Lora.

87
00:07:43,969 --> 00:07:45,903
There must be plenty of jobs
for a woman like you.

88
00:07:45,971 --> 00:07:48,201
But people won't take in
a woman with a child.

89
00:07:48,274 --> 00:07:51,437
And no matter what, I won't
be separated from my baby.

90
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:54,035
Hurry up, Mother.
I want to show Sarah Jane
my dolls!

91
00:07:54,113 --> 00:07:56,047
Well, all right.

92
00:08:06,926 --> 00:08:09,292
There's a little place
off the kitchen.

93
00:08:11,764 --> 00:08:14,892
But you could, uh,
hardly call it a room.

94
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:21,370
Oh, it'll do
for Sarah Jane and me.

95
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,774
And the kitchen,
we can make use of that too.

96
00:08:25,845 --> 00:08:29,645
I'll get you some
pillows and blankets.
Thank you.

97
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:37,651
Here, Sarah Jane,
you can have Nancy.

98
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:45,361
It's a present.
Mommy just got it for me.
I want that one.

99
00:08:45,431 --> 00:08:49,697
Frieda's my friend.
I've had her all my life.

100
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:53,727
Mommy!
Mommy!
<i>Yes?</i>

101
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:56,434
She took my doll!
Oh.

102
00:08:56,508 --> 00:09:00,740
<i>Sarah Jane.</i>
<i>Where are your manners?</i>
<i>Now give it back.</i>

103
00:09:00,813 --> 00:09:03,407
I don't want the black one.
I'll take those.

104
00:09:03,482 --> 00:09:05,541
It's been a long day
and they're both tired
and cranky.

105
00:09:05,618 --> 00:09:07,916
Yes, Miss Lora.
Everything will be all right.

106
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:09,921
Come on, come on.

107
00:09:09,989 --> 00:09:13,083
Come on.

108
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,423
I don't wanna
live in the back.

109
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:20,295
Why do we always have
to live in the back?
Shh, honey.

110
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:30,036
Thank you, Mr. McKinney.

111
00:09:30,109 --> 00:09:33,101
Shh. Good-bye.

112
00:09:37,182 --> 00:09:39,116
Shh!

113
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:54,224
Good morning, darling.

114
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,632
Good morning,
Sarah Jane.
I want a kiss too.

115
00:09:56,702 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, of course.

116
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:02,234
Annie said we had to be quiet
until you got up.

117
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:05,334
Now we can talk out loud.
Now we can even scream.

118
00:10:05,411 --> 00:10:07,845
Children!

119
00:10:07,913 --> 00:10:10,313
<i>Children! What...</i>

120
00:10:10,382 --> 00:10:13,374
Oh, good morning,
Miss Lora.
<i>Good morning.</i>

121
00:10:13,452 --> 00:10:16,421
How are you
this morning?
<i>Just fine.</i>

122
00:10:16,488 --> 00:10:19,286
I'd love some coffee.

123
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:22,452
Well, Annie, you shouldn't
have done my laundry.

124
00:10:22,528 --> 00:10:25,725
I like taking care
of pretty things.

125
00:10:25,798 --> 00:10:28,892
Thank you.

126
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:31,664
Eggs?
Where did they come from?

127
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:34,001
The milkman was here
a minute ago.

128
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:36,007
I told him to leave
your regular order.

129
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:40,535
Oh, no. He didn't come
to leave my order. He stopped
doing that two weeks ago.

130
00:10:40,612 --> 00:10:42,580
May I?
Thank you.

131
00:10:42,648 --> 00:10:44,673
He wanted to collect
something on his bill.

132
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:48,083
Didn't say anything
about a bill to me.
He was very polite.

133
00:10:48,153 --> 00:10:51,054
Gave me the order and said,
looked like things
were picking up.

134
00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:55,059
He thought you were my maid.
Now he thinks I'm prosperous.

135
00:10:55,127 --> 00:10:59,063
No sin in lookin' prosperous.
Just a way of showin'
your trust in the lord.

136
00:10:59,131 --> 00:11:01,599
Telling him you're ready
whenever he is.

137
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,862
<i>I'll get it, Miss Lora.</i>

138
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:09,735
Miss Meredith's
residence.

139
00:11:09,808 --> 00:11:13,300
I'll see if it's convenient
for Miss Meredith
to come to the phone.

140
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:15,540
Is it the landlord
Mr. Berwitt?

141
00:11:15,614 --> 00:11:19,550
Pretty sure he said
the A-Acme Model Agency.

142
00:11:21,987 --> 00:11:23,921
Hello?

143
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:27,152
Yes, this is Miss Meredith.

144
00:11:29,661 --> 00:11:33,654
Yes. Yes, I can be there
by then.

145
00:11:36,602 --> 00:11:39,298
Fine. Thank you.

146
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:41,669
Oh, Annie, I've got
a job modeling.

147
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,002
A job?

148
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:45,509
I've registered everywhere.
But this is the first call.

149
00:11:45,577 --> 00:11:47,636
Now, isn't that fine?

150
00:11:52,184 --> 00:11:57,349
Annie, if you have
no other plans, will you stay
with Susie until I come back?

151
00:11:57,423 --> 00:11:59,482
Why, certainly.

152
00:11:59,558 --> 00:12:03,289
Do you know this will be
the first money I've earned
since I came to New York?

153
00:12:03,362 --> 00:12:05,694
Except for those envelopes.

154
00:12:05,764 --> 00:12:09,461
I was wondering what they were.
<i>I address them</i>
<i>for a mail-order house.</i>

155
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:14,302
By hand.
It gives them a personal touch,
and I can do them at home.

156
00:12:14,373 --> 00:12:19,037
They should have been
finished yesterday.
Well, can't be helped.

157
00:12:19,111 --> 00:12:22,012
If I get a job modeling,
at least I'll be seen.

158
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:31,789
Good boy.

159
00:12:31,857 --> 00:12:34,724
Yes, that's fine.
That's what I want.
Hold it. Beautiful.

160
00:12:34,793 --> 00:12:36,727
Just a minute.
Hold it.

161
00:12:39,431 --> 00:12:43,060
How could you sneeze?
I had it.

162
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,296
<i>I'm sorry, but it must be</i>
<i>this flea powder.</i>

163
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,101
No, no, no. Don't move.
You'll unfocus me.

164
00:12:49,174 --> 00:12:51,642
Art they want
and I get sneezes.

165
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,372
Now, don't move a hair.
Not one hair.

166
00:12:54,446 --> 00:12:56,607
Hold it, hold it.

167
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:04,752
Okay.

168
00:13:04,823 --> 00:13:07,485
Got it. Perfect.

169
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:12,689
You were
wonderful, Henry.
I never sneeze. Really...

170
00:13:12,764 --> 00:13:14,698
Your check will be
in the mail.

171
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:17,929
It would be so much
more convenient...
Checks are mailed on Thursday.

172
00:13:18,003 --> 00:13:20,403
We don't want to confuse
the bookkeeper.

173
00:13:20,472 --> 00:13:22,531
Don't forget to leave
the wardrobe.

174
00:13:32,217 --> 00:13:34,879
But wouldn't you like
to have a bite to eat?

175
00:13:34,953 --> 00:13:36,921
Later. Thanks.

176
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:47,723
You can keep the money
from this batch, Annie.

177
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:50,199
It'll pay you for staying
today and cooking and...

178
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:52,737
Uh-uh. That money
goes into our kitty.

179
00:13:54,473 --> 00:13:57,499
"Our"?

180
00:13:57,576 --> 00:13:59,544
Seems as if
you intend to stay.

181
00:13:59,611 --> 00:14:03,911
Seems like I do,
if, if you want it.

182
00:14:06,018 --> 00:14:10,387
You know I do.
But you can see
how bad things are.

183
00:14:10,455 --> 00:14:15,586
Miss Lora, we just come
from a place where,

184
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:19,757
where my color
deviled my baby.

185
00:14:19,831 --> 00:14:22,299
Now, anything happens here
has gotta be better.

186
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:26,064
Oh, Annie.
Oh.

187
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:36,511
Susie? Susie?
I'm home...

188
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:39,949
Oh, baby.
Mmm. Hi, dear.

189
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:41,952
Hello, Miss Lora.
Hello, Annie.

190
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,116
Mommy, we had such fun today.
Annie took us to the park
and we caught a squirrel.

191
00:14:46,191 --> 00:14:49,888
No, we didn't.
Well, we nearly did.

192
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:54,399
Tomorrow I'll take you
both to the park and
we'll really catch one.

193
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:57,731
How'd it go?
Oh, Annie.

194
00:14:58,804 --> 00:15:00,738
It didn't.

195
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:05,302
And I'm exhausted.

196
00:15:05,377 --> 00:15:08,710
Walked my feet off
trying to see every
agent on Broadway.

197
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,613
And some off Broadway.
Way off.

198
00:15:11,683 --> 00:15:14,151
I'll get it.

199
00:15:14,219 --> 00:15:16,483
The children have eaten.

200
00:15:17,556 --> 00:15:20,116
Yes?
Hello, this is
Steve Archer.

201
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:22,524
- Steve Archer?
- I brought the pictures.

202
00:15:22,594 --> 00:15:26,189
You brought the pictures?
The ones of the children
on the beach.

203
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:29,462
Oh, the man on the beach.
<i>The man on the beach?</i>

204
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:31,832
The man on the beach!
It's our picture
with the fat man!

205
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:34,736
<i>Mommy, tell him</i>
<i>to come up.</i>
<i>Yes, please!</i>

206
00:15:34,806 --> 00:15:39,539
Oh, all right. Will
you come up, Mr. Archer?

207
00:15:44,283 --> 00:15:48,879
Come on. Let's see.
Did you bring the pictures?
Hi, Susie, Sarah Jane.

208
00:15:48,954 --> 00:15:50,979
Where is it?
Aren't you kids
supposed to be in bed?

209
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:53,024
No, we waited for you!

210
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:55,719
Hello.
Good evening.

211
00:16:03,502 --> 00:16:06,835
If it's that funny,
let me see it.

212
00:16:12,044 --> 00:16:15,445
Don't you think
it's funny, Annie?

213
00:16:15,514 --> 00:16:19,109
<i>I don't know who's funnier,</i>
<i>you or that man.</i>

214
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:23,746
All I got to say is,
it's lucky I didn't catch
Sarah Jane playing such pranks.

215
00:16:23,822 --> 00:16:27,383
It just ain't
seemly, Miss Lora.
Now, off to bed.

216
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:29,427
Good night.
Good night.

217
00:16:29,494 --> 00:16:31,758
Good night, Mr. Archer.
Good night, ladies.

218
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,856
Good night.
Won't you sit down?

219
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:37,902
It was very nice of you
to remember the children.

220
00:16:37,969 --> 00:16:42,406
I like what you did...
for Sarah Jane and Annie.

221
00:16:42,474 --> 00:16:47,138
Well, they didn't have a place
and since I live here alone...

222
00:16:47,212 --> 00:16:52,047
I'm a widow.
Oh, you... are.

223
00:16:54,953 --> 00:16:58,252
What do you think of this?

224
00:16:58,323 --> 00:17:00,450
<i>Mother in distress.</i>

225
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:04,017
Well, that's good.
Very good.

226
00:17:06,832 --> 00:17:10,928
Who are you anyway?
Well, you don't look
like a photographer.

227
00:17:11,002 --> 00:17:13,334
Apparently the army
thought I did.

228
00:17:13,405 --> 00:17:15,396
Anyhow, they made me one.

229
00:17:15,474 --> 00:17:19,342
Now all I wanna do is
get pictures like this
in The Museum of Modern Art.

230
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:21,743
Oh, you're aiming high.

231
00:17:21,813 --> 00:17:24,111
Why not?
It doesn't cost anymore.

232
00:17:24,182 --> 00:17:27,413
Don't you believe
in chasing rainbows?

233
00:17:27,486 --> 00:17:33,118
Well, if I didn't,
I wouldn't be here.
I'm an actress.

234
00:17:36,027 --> 00:17:40,020
What's the matter?
Your bones.

235
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:42,828
What about my bones?

236
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:45,335
They're perfect.

237
00:17:45,404 --> 00:17:49,670
My camera could easily
have a love affair with you.

238
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:54,841
Don't you think it's
getting a little late?

239
00:17:56,748 --> 00:18:00,047
I don't suppose you'd like
to have dinner with me.

240
00:18:00,118 --> 00:18:02,780
Maybe. Sometime.

241
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:06,187
I don't mean right away.
How about tomorrow?

242
00:18:06,258 --> 00:18:11,389
I'm sorry, but I don't like
to miss having dinner with the
children two nights in a row.

243
00:18:11,463 --> 00:18:14,728
I can understand that.
How about lunch?

244
00:18:16,134 --> 00:18:18,193
Lunch?

245
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,068
Would you mind taking me
to Rodney's?

246
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:23,972
It's a little place
on 45th and 8th.

247
00:18:24,042 --> 00:18:26,010
Unemployed actors
can afford it.

248
00:18:26,077 --> 00:18:28,671
Sort of a poor man's 21.

249
00:18:28,747 --> 00:18:32,205
All right, I'll meet you
there at noon.

250
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:37,611
Oh, by the way,
the name's Steve.

251
00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:43,290
Everybody in here an actor?
Just about.

252
00:18:43,361 --> 00:18:46,023
So far you're the only one
I really believe.

253
00:18:46,097 --> 00:18:50,659
Thank you. Only so far,
you're the only one
in New York who does.

254
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:53,727
But someday I'm going to
make them all feel that way.

255
00:18:53,805 --> 00:18:58,333
Aren't you a little late
getting started?
I mean, it's...

256
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,608
Yes, five years late.
That's why every day counts.

257
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:07,243
Why the five-year lapse?
My husband was
in the theater too.

258
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,550
A director.
A good director.

259
00:19:10,622 --> 00:19:13,250
Everything I know
I owe to him.

260
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:17,227
It was a small town,
a little theater,
but professional.

261
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:21,595
When he died,
I had to make a living
doing something else.

262
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:24,658
I never really wanted
anything but the stage.

263
00:19:24,736 --> 00:19:26,795
Oh, except Susie.

264
00:19:26,872 --> 00:19:30,239
So, it took me five years
to save enough money
to come to New York.

265
00:19:30,308 --> 00:19:32,367
But you did it.
Mm-hmm.

266
00:19:32,444 --> 00:19:35,470
And I'm going to be an
actress, an important one...
<i>Lora?</i>

267
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:37,481
Lora.
Oh, excuse me.

268
00:19:37,549 --> 00:19:39,847
Nothing in it for me,
honey,

269
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:43,285
but they're
beginning to cast a new
Tennessee Williams play.

270
00:19:43,355 --> 00:19:46,290
Oh, what agent?
Allen Loomis... today.

271
00:19:46,358 --> 00:19:49,191
So put on
your roller skates.
Oh, thanks, Fay.

272
00:19:50,328 --> 00:19:52,262
Coffee?
I'm sorry,
but I've got to go.

273
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,264
You haven't eaten.
You go ahead.
Good-bye.

274
00:19:54,332 --> 00:19:56,266
How about dinner?
Tonight?
We'll take Susie.

275
00:19:56,334 --> 00:19:58,302
Fine.
Where?

276
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,338
Come and have
dinner with us.
All right.

277
00:20:00,405 --> 00:20:02,339
Good luck.
Thanks, Fay.

278
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:14,181
But when can I have
an appointment?

279
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:19,019
How about a week
from today? Thursday.

280
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:23,618
Put me down.
It's Iris Dawn.
Don't forget it.

281
00:20:23,694 --> 00:20:25,628
Tsk.

282
00:20:25,696 --> 00:20:28,096
I'm sorry to add
to your troubles, but...

283
00:20:28,165 --> 00:20:30,759
I'm afraid I'm a little late
for my appointment.

284
00:20:30,835 --> 00:20:34,032
Name, please.
Miss Meredith.

285
00:20:34,105 --> 00:20:36,403
Mered...
Meredith.

286
00:20:36,474 --> 00:20:38,442
Well, I don't seem
to have you down.

287
00:20:38,509 --> 00:20:41,603
Never mind.
Just tell Mr. Loomis
that Robert Hayes sent me.

288
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,080
Robert Hayes?
<i>From International</i>
<i>Studio.</i>

289
00:20:45,149 --> 00:20:48,550
It's probably just a slipup
from the coast, but, uh,

290
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:50,553
Mr. Hayes won't
like it at all.

291
00:20:50,621 --> 00:20:53,283
<i>I hope you didn't</i>
<i>slip up.</i>
Me?

292
00:20:53,357 --> 00:20:56,986
Well, if you say
there's no appointment,
um, good-bye.

293
00:20:57,061 --> 00:20:59,120
Well, just a second.

294
00:20:59,196 --> 00:21:03,633
Why don't you sit down
and I'll see if I can
straighten this out?

295
00:21:03,701 --> 00:21:05,896
Thank you.

296
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,904
Mr. Loomis?
Yes?

297
00:21:07,972 --> 00:21:10,065
There's a Miss Meredith here
from Hollywood.

298
00:21:10,141 --> 00:21:13,668
<i>Yes, quite lovely.</i>

299
00:21:13,744 --> 00:21:18,147
Think we should
send her away?
No. I think
you ought to see her.

300
00:21:18,215 --> 00:21:20,809
Fine.
Okay.

301
00:21:22,386 --> 00:21:26,288
Miss Meredith?
You can go in now.

302
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:33,622
Um, just right in.

303
00:21:33,698 --> 00:21:35,757
Robert sends
his warmest greetings.

304
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:39,200
Well, thanks.
And how is he?
Marvelous.

305
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,728
He's lost 15 pounds.
You know what an effort
that is for him.

306
00:21:42,807 --> 00:21:45,275
And, uh, what can
I do for you?

307
00:21:45,343 --> 00:21:50,406
Robert thought I shouldn't
do any more pictures before
I did a show on Broadway.

308
00:21:50,481 --> 00:21:52,608
Very sensible.
<i>I'm glad</i>
<i>you think so too.</i>

309
00:21:52,683 --> 00:21:57,017
That's why Robert
sent me to you.
He thought I'd get more...

310
00:21:57,088 --> 00:21:59,955
personal attention
from you.

311
00:22:00,024 --> 00:22:03,289
He could be right there.
You mind?
<i>No.</i>

312
00:22:03,361 --> 00:22:05,955
Incidentally, how's the new
Tennessee Williams play?

313
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:11,434
Bound to be a blockbuster,
but all cast.

314
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:15,233
Hello? Oh, Lillian!
What?

315
00:22:15,306 --> 00:22:18,469
<i>Oh, well,</i>
<i>can't you break it?</i>

316
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:21,010
<i>Oh. No, I don't mind.</i>

317
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:25,208
I don't mind you
standing me up. I'm fine.
I'll just kill myself.

318
00:22:25,282 --> 00:22:27,216
Yeah.

319
00:22:27,284 --> 00:22:32,551
<i>Never be a bachelor.</i>
<i>There's no security.</i>
I know how you feel.

320
00:22:32,623 --> 00:22:36,059
Yeah? Say, how'd you like
to go with me tonight?

321
00:22:36,127 --> 00:22:38,561
I'm afraid I can't.

322
00:22:38,629 --> 00:22:40,722
Big party.
Lots of important people.

323
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,531
Well, I could see if I could
break a couple of engagements.

324
00:22:45,603 --> 00:22:47,537
I'll call my place.

325
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:49,869
I'll call.
What's the number?

326
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,636
Montgomery,

327
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,678
76120.

328
00:22:54,745 --> 00:22:57,873
...One, two, oh.

329
00:23:00,918 --> 00:23:03,216
Miss Meredith's residence.

330
00:23:03,287 --> 00:23:06,017
Oh, this <i>is</i>
Miss Meredith's residence?

331
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,856
That'll be Annie, my maid.
I'll talk to her.

332
00:23:14,331 --> 00:23:18,893
Annie, uh, call
the Waldorf and tell, um,

333
00:23:18,969 --> 00:23:22,200
you-know-who I cannot have
cocktails and dinner with him.

334
00:23:22,273 --> 00:23:26,903
Uh, I know who?
Oh, yes, Miss Lora,
I'll do that.

335
00:23:26,977 --> 00:23:29,445
Thank you.

336
00:23:29,513 --> 00:23:31,538
Well, Mr. Loomis,
it looks like I'm free.

337
00:23:31,615 --> 00:23:34,880
That'll be just fine.
Should be an interesting
evening for me.

338
00:23:34,952 --> 00:23:38,888
Hollywood actress and...
Oh, that reminds me.
Excuse me.

339
00:23:38,956 --> 00:23:40,890
<i>Yes, Mr. Loomis?</i>

340
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:43,518
Annette, get me Hollywood,
Mr. Robert Hayes.

341
00:23:43,594 --> 00:23:47,530
International Studios,
right? International...
Um.

342
00:23:47,598 --> 00:23:50,965
Maybe you better not
go through with that call.

343
00:23:51,035 --> 00:23:54,163
You don't think so?
Why not?

344
00:23:56,307 --> 00:23:59,367
Because Robert Hayes
doesn't exist.

345
00:23:59,443 --> 00:24:03,937
I understand.
Annette, cancel the call.

346
00:24:04,014 --> 00:24:05,948
<i>Yes, Mr. Loomis.</i>
I was desperate.

347
00:24:06,016 --> 00:24:09,952
You were pretty good.
You lied. All actresses lie.
I know that.

348
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,046
But I believed you.
I'm sorry.

349
00:24:13,123 --> 00:24:16,422
Don't leave.
You took me in.

350
00:24:16,494 --> 00:24:19,429
For all of 20 seconds,
you took me in,
but I don't mind.

351
00:24:19,497 --> 00:24:23,831
It was a good acting job,
and you're very pretty.

352
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:26,461
Now, about tonight.
Shall I pick you up?

353
00:24:26,537 --> 00:24:30,098
Um, no, it'll be easier
for me to meet you here.

354
00:24:30,174 --> 00:24:34,235
8:00?
You'll find me
very prompt, Mr. Loomis.

355
00:24:57,968 --> 00:24:59,902
Come on in.

356
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,997
Sit down. I just have
a few letters to sign.

357
00:25:04,074 --> 00:25:06,235
Oh, drink?
No, thank you.

358
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:10,610
But aren't we going
to be late to the party?
Plenty of time, plenty.

359
00:25:10,681 --> 00:25:14,310
And I need a drink.
So relax.

360
00:25:14,385 --> 00:25:17,479
<i>Say, you're not allergic</i>
<i>to mink, are you?</i>

361
00:25:17,555 --> 00:25:21,252
Mink? No,
I don't think so.
<i>Good.</i>

362
00:25:27,031 --> 00:25:30,262
Try this on for size.

363
00:25:30,334 --> 00:25:33,826
But whose is it?
Mine. And I only loan it
to very special clients.

364
00:25:33,904 --> 00:25:36,099
I want you to wear it
tonight.
You want me to wear...

365
00:25:36,173 --> 00:25:38,107
Please. Got to think
of my reputation.

366
00:25:38,175 --> 00:25:42,111
I haven't been seen
with a girl without a mink
since the heat wave of'39.

367
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,579
Come on.

368
00:25:44,648 --> 00:25:47,947
We should spend
a little time talking
about our future.

369
00:25:48,018 --> 00:25:51,385
You can act. Well,
that's of no importance
at the moment.

370
00:25:51,455 --> 00:25:54,288
The main thing is,
you're a beaut.

371
00:25:54,358 --> 00:25:58,419
Please, don't.
Oh, and you're decent too.

372
00:25:58,495 --> 00:26:00,463
No doubt possess
some fine principles.

373
00:26:00,531 --> 00:26:02,795
Well, me, I'm a man
of very few principles,

374
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:05,300
and they're all open
to revision.

375
00:26:05,369 --> 00:26:07,894
But I'm in a position
to do something for you.

376
00:26:07,972 --> 00:26:10,964
You'll get 10% of everything
I make. Isn't that enough?

377
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:13,532
No. Now,
sit down and listen.

378
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:20,283
Here it is, short and clear.
You're not a chicken.

379
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:22,342
You're no high-hearted kid
out of some drama school,

380
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:24,478
wanting to do or die
for dear old Thespis.

381
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:26,546
<i>And you're beginning</i>
<i>under a handicap.</i>

382
00:26:26,624 --> 00:26:29,457
I know I'm starting late.
<i>So time isn't on your side.</i>

383
00:26:29,526 --> 00:26:31,994
But you do have
some qualifications.

384
00:26:32,062 --> 00:26:36,362
Your face will pass.
You've good, nice, long
silky legs. I like them.

385
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:38,924
You have a chest full
of quality and quantity.
I like it.

386
00:26:39,003 --> 00:26:43,201
Aren't you taking
a few things for granted?
Me? I don't count.

387
00:26:43,273 --> 00:26:46,208
But there are certain
people who do, and you're
going to meet all of them.

388
00:26:46,276 --> 00:26:49,211
That is, if you're really
serious about your career.

389
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,840
I am, but...
Good, then you're going
every place with me.

390
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:55,680
Every party, opening night,
every saloon in town.

391
00:26:55,753 --> 00:26:58,722
With a complete new
wardrobe at my expense.

392
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:00,689
Oh, it's tax deductible.

393
00:27:00,758 --> 00:27:03,318
This is a tough,
competitive racket.

394
00:27:03,394 --> 00:27:06,329
Although it's a lot
more than any agent
is supposed to do,

395
00:27:06,397 --> 00:27:09,628
I'd do it.

396
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,793
What's this got
to do with acting?
Nothing.

397
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:15,669
But I'll show you how to
realize your ambitions,
if you do as I say.

398
00:27:15,739 --> 00:27:19,334
If the dramatists' club wants
to eat and sleep with you,
you eat and sleep with them.

399
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:22,538
If some producer with a hand
as cold as a toad wants to do
a painting of you in the nude,

400
00:27:22,613 --> 00:27:24,547
you'll accommodate him
for a very small part.

401
00:27:24,615 --> 00:27:26,947
It's disgusting!
It pays off.

402
00:27:27,017 --> 00:27:28,951
You're disgusting.
Maybe I am.

403
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:32,955
But let me assure you,
once you get it made,

404
00:27:33,023 --> 00:27:35,890
you can be idealistic
all of ten seconds
before you die.

405
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:39,827
You're trying to cheapen me.
But you won't. Not me.

406
00:27:39,897 --> 00:27:43,298
Oh, I'll make it, Mr. Loomis,
but it'll be my way.

407
00:27:53,576 --> 00:27:56,010
You have a wonderful
handwriting, Annie.

408
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:59,913
Oh, thank you, Mr. Steve.
But my spellin'
won't take no prizes.

409
00:27:59,983 --> 00:28:02,611
I don't think Lora
has anything to worry about
as long as you're with her.

410
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:05,984
Oh, we'll get by.
I made an agreement
with the landlord.

411
00:28:06,055 --> 00:28:08,148
He's really
a nice person.
Oh?

412
00:28:08,224 --> 00:28:11,660
Just for doin'
the staircases twice a week,
we get $10 off our rent.

413
00:28:11,728 --> 00:28:13,662
Is that a fact?

414
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,699
I answered an ad
and got a job while
the kids are at school.

415
00:28:16,766 --> 00:28:19,394
Doing what?
Doing shirts
for a gentleman.

416
00:28:19,469 --> 00:28:22,870
He's real persnickety
about his shirts.

417
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,093
Oh, Steve.
Hello.

418
00:28:47,163 --> 00:28:50,223
I'm sorry. It's just
that I got so involved.

419
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,633
We're having
a wonderful time.
How'd everything go?

420
00:28:53,703 --> 00:28:57,662
Oh, just fine. I went
to the 21 with Mr. Loomis.

421
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:00,436
Everybody there
was somebody exciting.

422
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,206
For the first time,
I felt that I was somebody too.

423
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,304
Is Mr. Loomis gonna
find you a job?

424
00:29:05,381 --> 00:29:08,612
Well, he, uh,

425
00:29:08,685 --> 00:29:11,984
he wanted to represent me,
but...

426
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:18,916
But I...
Oh, Annie.

427
00:29:18,995 --> 00:29:21,987
What's wrong, Miss Lora?

428
00:29:22,065 --> 00:29:25,592
Everything. Everything.

429
00:29:25,668 --> 00:29:31,038
Now, you just rest.
Everything will work out.

430
00:29:31,107 --> 00:29:35,441
I'll go get you
a glass of hot milk, huh?

431
00:29:44,454 --> 00:29:47,582
Can I help in any way?
No.

432
00:29:47,657 --> 00:29:50,558
No one can.

433
00:29:50,626 --> 00:29:53,026
No one.

434
00:29:53,096 --> 00:29:55,758
I'm so ashamed.

435
00:29:57,133 --> 00:30:00,261
It was horrible.

436
00:30:00,336 --> 00:30:03,362
He tried to make me
feel so cheap.

437
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:05,373
You could never
be cheap.

438
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:08,899
You don't know
what I mean.
Yes, I do.

439
00:30:08,978 --> 00:30:12,311
It happens all the time.
Not just in the theater.

440
00:30:12,382 --> 00:30:15,283
I love the theater.
It's what I want.

441
00:30:15,351 --> 00:30:19,617
Then hold onto your dreams.
Forget tonight.

442
00:30:19,689 --> 00:30:23,989
But they seem so stale
after tonight.

443
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:29,088
So stale I can't believe
in them anymore.

444
00:30:29,165 --> 00:30:32,498
M-Maybe I'm a fool.

445
00:30:34,237 --> 00:30:38,003
Maybe I should see things
as they really are...

446
00:30:38,074 --> 00:30:41,942
and not as
I want them to be.

447
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:46,778
If I know you,
they'll have to be
the way you want them.

448
00:30:49,085 --> 00:30:51,315
Thanks, Steve.

449
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:56,620
You're so, so good
for what ails me.

450
00:30:56,692 --> 00:31:01,595
It's all part of
the Archer service...
day or night.

451
00:31:02,665 --> 00:31:05,964
I'll call you soon,
Lora.

452
00:31:06,035 --> 00:31:08,003
Tomorrow.

453
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,004
Yes, please, tomorrow.

454
00:31:35,765 --> 00:31:39,861
<i>Annie, what's happened</i>
<i>to Susie's wrist?</i>

455
00:31:39,936 --> 00:31:44,066
Oh, nothin' serious.
Just a little experiment.

456
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,370
Experiment?
Sarah Jane's fault.

457
00:31:46,442 --> 00:31:50,970
After class, one of the kids
said that Negro blood
was different.

458
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:55,074
So later this evenin',
Sarah Jane wanted to compare
her blood with Susie's.

459
00:31:55,151 --> 00:31:57,745
Well, I spanked her good.

460
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:01,415
Oh, well, you know
how children are.

461
00:32:01,491 --> 00:32:04,255
They were only playing.

462
00:32:04,327 --> 00:32:08,263
I hope so, Miss Lora.
I hope so.

463
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:18,834
Santa Claus has many names
in many different countries.

464
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:21,337
In Holland, he is
called <i>Sinter Klaas.</i>

465
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:25,467
<i>In France,</i>
Saint Nicolas.

466
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,943
In Sweden, he is
known as <i>Jul Tomte.</i>

467
00:32:28,013 --> 00:32:31,471
In Germany, he is...

468
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:35,820
Oh, can I do something
for you?

469
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:38,219
<i>Sorry to trouble you,</i>
<i>but I brought these</i>
<i>for my little girl.</i>

470
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,382
I'm afraid you've
made a mistake.

471
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,392
I don't have any little
colored girl in my class.

472
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,190
But they said 3-B.
This is 3-B, isn't...

473
00:32:46,231 --> 00:32:48,722
Why, there's Sarah Jane.

474
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,701
There's my baby.
You mean Sarah Jane
Johnson?

475
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:54,568
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Mrs. Johnson.

476
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:03,238
Sarah Jane, baby,
I brought you your...

477
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,248
Sarah Jane!
We didn't know.

478
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:12,147
<i>Sarah Jane?</i>
<i>Wait.</i>

479
00:33:12,223 --> 00:33:14,783
<i>Sarah Jane?</i>

480
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,453
Baby? Wait.

481
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:22,898
Sarah Jane?

482
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,633
Sarah Jane, wait.

483
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:32,700
Wait. Now, now,
let me do it.

484
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:36,304
Now, put your coat on.
What do you want to do,
catch pneumonia?

485
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,578
I hope I do!
I hope I die!

486
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,676
Honey, nothing's hurt.
You shouldn't
have let them...

487
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:45,052
They didn't ask me.
Why should I tell them?

488
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,717
Because that's what you
are, and it's nothin'
to be ashamed of.

489
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:51,728
Why do you have to be
my mother? Why?

490
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:01,604
Why, you're
practically normal.

491
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:22,120
You two are soaking wet.
Get out of those things
and I'll make some tea.

492
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,492
I'll be fine.
You better get ready.
Mr. Steve's comin'.

493
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:29,431
Serve him right to wait.
He was due here
over an hour ago.

494
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:34,336
I just don't want
everybody having colds.
Cups and...

495
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,670
What's wrong?

496
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:41,200
Sarah Jane's been
passing at school,

497
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,270
pretending she's white.

498
00:34:43,348 --> 00:34:46,545
But I am white!
I'm as white as Susie.

499
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:55,750
Oh, honey,
don't you see it doesn't
make any difference to us?

500
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:59,558
Because we all love you.

501
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,531
I'll take you back
to school myself.

502
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,590
I'm never going back
to that school!

503
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:07,399
Never as long as I live!

504
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:11,272
Sarah Jane!
Don't cry!

505
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:17,141
Annie, don't be upset.
Children are always pretending.

506
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,649
You know that.

507
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:25,553
No, it's a sin to be
ashamed of what you are.

508
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,956
It's even worse to pretend,

509
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:31,291
to lie.

510
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:35,890
Sarah Jane has to learn
that the Lord must
have had his reasons...

511
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,162
for making some
of us white...

512
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,261
and some of us black.

513
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:42,329
Sarah Jane Doesn't
want me with her.

514
00:35:42,407 --> 00:35:45,968
She says I'm not her friend.
She says nobody's
her friend.

515
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:49,639
Darling, she's upset right now.
But she'll be better soon.

516
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:53,047
So will you if you get
back in bed. Come on.

517
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,257
Don't worry, Annie.
I'm sure you'll be able
to explain things to her.

518
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:03,488
I don't know.

519
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:08,624
How do you explain to your child
she was born to be hurt?

520
00:36:23,747 --> 00:36:26,079
Hello.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

521
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,484
That's all right.
I'm ready. I thought
you'd never get here.

522
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,716
Why, Steve, you sold it!

523
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:40,753
More than that, they gave me
a job, a steady one
on the advertising staff.

524
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,163
Oh, that's wonderful.

525
00:36:43,233 --> 00:36:47,067
But, darling, is it really
what you want?

526
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:49,435
Well, it's not
The Museum of Modern Art.

527
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:53,135
But they pay you
in the nicest-looking
green folding money.

528
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,145
Which reminds me,
this is the season
for spending it.

529
00:36:56,213 --> 00:36:58,647
Let's go.

530
00:36:58,715 --> 00:37:02,344
We have to get a tree,
and I have a list of gifts
for the kids and Annie.

531
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:05,354
And I hope you like
what I picked out for you.

532
00:37:05,422 --> 00:37:08,755
Oh, Steve, you...
You have to have something
to put under a tree, don't you?

533
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,987
Well, I know, but...
This way, ma'am.

534
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:13,325
Oh, I feel awful.

535
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,628
I haven't been able to buy
you anything really nice.

536
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,498
It's been five months
without a job...

537
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:23,336
Then I guess you'll
have to marry me.

538
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,934
It's the least you can do
for me for Christmas.

539
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:29,103
I love you.

540
00:37:29,179 --> 00:37:31,841
But, darling, you're...

541
00:37:31,915 --> 00:37:35,009
You're just
getting started and...

542
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:37,019
It would be foolish.

543
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:39,578
At least we'd
be foolish together.

544
00:37:39,656 --> 00:37:42,523
But marriage
is such a big step.

545
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:46,290
I want us to be together.
Well, we are,
most of the time.

546
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:48,991
Most of the time
you're out fighting
to get somewhere.

547
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,034
Breaking your heart,
trying to do for
yourself and Susie...

548
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:53,626
what I want to do for you,
what I finally
can do for you.

549
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:57,105
Pardon me. I'm sorry.
Pardon me.
Oh!

550
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:59,699
Well, wait a minute.

551
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:05,874
I want to give you a home,
take care of you, love you.

552
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:10,283
Oh, Steve, you
don't know me at all.

553
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,549
I still love the theater.

554
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,319
You tried it
and it's only hurt you.

555
00:38:15,392 --> 00:38:17,326
Realize that
and you'll get over it.

556
00:38:17,394 --> 00:38:21,125
I want to be honest
with you, darling.

557
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:23,860
I want more.

558
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:27,233
Everything.

559
00:38:27,304 --> 00:38:29,238
Maybe too much.

560
00:38:29,306 --> 00:38:31,900
Don't think I want any less.

561
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:35,672
So let's settle something
right now. Do you love me?

562
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,014
I think I do,
but...

563
00:38:42,085 --> 00:38:44,019
Come here.

564
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:46,385
I want to kiss you
so badly.

565
00:38:46,456 --> 00:38:51,189
But if you did,
the way things are right now,

566
00:38:51,261 --> 00:38:55,721
I might say something
I wouldn't really mean.

567
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:59,929
That's why
I want to kiss you.

568
00:39:00,003 --> 00:39:02,403
That's my phone.

569
00:39:04,741 --> 00:39:08,268
Hello?
Miss Meredith's residence.

570
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:13,246
- Who, Mr. Loomis?
- She's not in.

571
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:17,219
She isn't in, Mr. Loomis.
No, not even if it's important.

572
00:39:18,288 --> 00:39:20,222
<i>What? A job?</i>

573
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:23,726
I... I have to find out.
It could be something.

574
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,731
Yes, Mr. Loomis?

575
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:32,200
You look good with
a St. Bernard dog.
The St. Bernard dog?

576
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:34,203
Yes. Uh-huh.

577
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:37,206
Well, that's you
in the picture, isn't it?

578
00:39:37,274 --> 00:39:39,708
Sprinkling flea powder?

579
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:42,244
All right, well, I'm here
with David Edwards.

580
00:39:42,312 --> 00:39:44,177
David...
Edwards, yes.

581
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,580
You know,
the prize-winning playwright.

582
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:49,084
He saw that picture
in a magazine.

583
00:39:49,152 --> 00:39:53,088
He's looking for a girl with
that certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i>
for his new play.

584
00:39:53,156 --> 00:39:56,421
That certain something
you managed to get
with the dog.

585
00:39:56,493 --> 00:40:00,395
It's not a big part, I know...
If this is one of
your jokes, Mr. Loomis...

586
00:40:00,464 --> 00:40:03,399
Jokes? So help me,
I'm only thinking
percentage-wise.

587
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:05,901
The part calls for
about...
Two and a half.

588
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:08,403
Two-fifty a week.

589
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:11,805
I left the script with
my secretary. Can you
pick it up immediately?

590
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:14,366
Uh, yes.
Yes, Mr. Loomis.

591
00:40:14,444 --> 00:40:16,378
Yes.

592
00:40:16,446 --> 00:40:19,381
He wants me
to pick up a script;
I'm to audition tomorrow.

593
00:40:19,449 --> 00:40:21,383
And you're going
down there?
Of course.

594
00:40:21,451 --> 00:40:24,887
Even after what
happened last time?
This has
nothing to do with Loomis.

595
00:40:24,955 --> 00:40:28,391
I'm to audition
for David Edwards.
How do you know that?

596
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:30,392
I know. I just know.

597
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,396
But do you know if he's
gonna be any different
than Loomis?
No, I don't.

598
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:38,924
I don't want you to go.
Don't you realize what
this could mean to me?

599
00:40:39,002 --> 00:40:42,438
I'm not asking you
not to go down there,
I'm <i>telling</i> you.

600
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:45,942
What makes you think
you have that right?
Because I love you.

601
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:48,944
Isn't that enough?
No, Steve, I'm sorry.
Good night.

602
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:53,212
Lora, wait.

603
00:40:53,283 --> 00:40:56,719
I didn't mean
to sound dictatorial or
to try to run your life,

604
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:00,223
but you have to understand
how I feel.
And what about
the way I feel?

605
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,656
Oh, stop acting.
I'm not acting.

606
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,661
I want to achieve something,
something you'll never
understand.

607
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:09,221
What you're after isn't real.
At least
I'm after something!

608
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:12,735
Not the snapshot of
a disgusting old man with
a beer can on his belly.

609
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:16,239
Is that your idea
of achieving something?
Is a beer can "real"?

610
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:18,240
Going up and down,
up and down.

611
00:41:18,308 --> 00:41:21,744
Well, I'm going up and up
and up, and nobody's
going to pull me down!

612
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:24,007
Lora, listen, please.

613
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:27,517
I've been trying to do
something with my pictures.
It's meant everything to me.

614
00:41:27,584 --> 00:41:30,519
Every minute,
for a long time now.
No, it hasn't.

615
00:41:30,587 --> 00:41:33,715
Or you wouldn't
give it up to sell beer.

616
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:37,726
I gave it up for
something much better,
something right now: You.

617
00:41:37,794 --> 00:41:41,230
But you're asking me
to give up something
I've wanted all my life,

618
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:44,233
ever since I was a child,
and I can't do it!

619
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,235
If you grew up,
you could.

620
00:41:47,637 --> 00:41:49,571
What do you mean?

621
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:52,708
You're not
a child anymore,

622
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:55,711
and I might not be around
to pick up the pieces
this time.

623
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,713
Good.

624
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:00,511
I'd like it that way.
Forever.

625
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:20,269
Joseph and Mary couldn't
find no place at the inn,

626
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:23,773
so they had to go to the
stable among the animals.

627
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,774
The animals?
Mm-hmm.

628
00:42:25,842 --> 00:42:28,777
And in the manger
Jesus was born.

629
00:42:28,845 --> 00:42:32,440
<i>And the heavenly hosts</i>
<i>sang, "Hallelujah."</i>

630
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:35,451
<i>There was a shining bright</i>
<i>star in the sky,</i>

631
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:39,455
<i>and it was</i>
<i>a beautiful time.</i>

632
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:42,959
That'll be
Mr. Steve again.

633
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,423
Hello?
Hello, Annie.

634
00:42:49,499 --> 00:42:52,662
- Oh, hello, Mr. Steve.
- Has she come in yet?

635
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,863
I'm sorry.

636
00:42:54,938 --> 00:42:56,872
I see.

637
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,999
Well, Merry Christmas,
Annie.

638
00:42:59,075 --> 00:43:01,202
Merry Christmas to you,
Mr. Steve.

639
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:04,304
Mommy, isn't Steve
coming here tonight?

640
00:43:04,381 --> 00:43:07,316
I think you'd better
go to bed, both of you.

641
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:09,750
But Annie was
telling us a story.

642
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,755
Oh, all right,
Annie can finish it.
Where were we?

643
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,087
- Jesus was almost borned.
- That's right.

644
00:43:15,158 --> 00:43:20,357
As soon as the holy infant
was born, three wise men saw
a beautiful star in the sky.

645
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:23,365
The star
of Bethlehem...
Was Jesus white or black?

646
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:26,368
It doesn't matter.
He's the way
you imagine him.

647
00:43:26,436 --> 00:43:29,098
But Annie said
he was a real man.

648
00:43:29,172 --> 00:43:31,106
He's not a pretend man.

649
00:43:31,174 --> 00:43:33,233
He was real.
He <i>is</i> real.

650
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,244
Then what color was he?

651
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,746
He was like me...
White.

652
00:43:41,914 --> 00:43:44,815
Now, the closet door
is over here.

653
00:43:44,883 --> 00:43:48,046
The clothes closet door
is over there.

654
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,055
The door to your bedroom
is over here.

655
00:43:51,123 --> 00:43:54,559
And you trip over
the vacuum cleaner
over there.

656
00:43:56,461 --> 00:43:59,453
All right,
come on, let's have
your offstage line.

657
00:44:05,771 --> 00:44:07,398
<i>Is anybody home?</i>

658
00:44:07,472 --> 00:44:10,339
Marjorie?
Oh, Marjorie!

659
00:44:12,911 --> 00:44:15,846
Colonel, what are you
doing in there?

660
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:21,018
Why, Mr. Obermeyer,
why aren't you in Duluth?

661
00:44:24,222 --> 00:44:26,156
Oh, Herbert, you too?

662
00:44:26,224 --> 00:44:28,886
<i>No! No, no,</i>
<i>Miss Meredith.</i>

663
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:32,192
David, David.
She can do it, David.
I guarantee it.

664
00:44:32,264 --> 00:44:34,255
She's just
a little nervous.
Miss Meredith.

665
00:44:34,333 --> 00:44:36,426
Yes, sir?

666
00:44:36,501 --> 00:44:40,164
This scene is supposed to
be played for high comedy,
with delicate reactions,

667
00:44:40,238 --> 00:44:42,172
not loud,
goggle-eyed takes.

668
00:44:43,742 --> 00:44:45,733
I'm sorry, Mr. Edwards.

669
00:44:45,811 --> 00:44:49,838
But I'm an actress,
and a good one.

670
00:44:49,915 --> 00:44:53,578
But I couldn't play
this part for high comedy.
Nobody could.

671
00:44:53,652 --> 00:44:57,349
<i>Nobody.</i>
I think that's all,
Miss Meredith.

672
00:44:57,422 --> 00:45:00,357
<i>And if you'll forgive me</i>
<i>for saying it,</i>

673
00:45:00,425 --> 00:45:03,360
you're too good a writer
to have such a scene
in your play.

674
00:45:03,428 --> 00:45:06,261
Okay, sister,
this way out.

675
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:10,825
I might as well confess...
She's not really my client.
Tell her to wait a minute.

676
00:45:15,374 --> 00:45:19,333
Lora!
Lora, wait a minute.

677
00:45:19,411 --> 00:45:22,346
I think we've still
got a chance.
No, I don't...

678
00:45:22,414 --> 00:45:24,348
Miss Meredith.

679
00:45:25,584 --> 00:45:28,815
It's been a long time
since anyone told me off.

680
00:45:28,887 --> 00:45:32,323
Tell me, what would you do
with that scene?

681
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:37,127
I'd cut it out.
Drop it entirely.

682
00:45:38,196 --> 00:45:41,324
That's not a bad idea.
Let me think.

683
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,234
Yes, but the scene
has a couple of lines
that are important.

684
00:45:45,303 --> 00:45:47,237
Give them to Amy.

685
00:45:48,407 --> 00:45:50,466
Yes, it would work.

686
00:45:51,677 --> 00:45:53,941
Ha!
Think you could play Amy?

687
00:45:55,747 --> 00:45:58,409
Amy?

688
00:45:58,483 --> 00:46:01,919
Of course we'll have to
work very hard together.
I'd love it.

689
00:46:01,987 --> 00:46:04,421
So would I. Tom?
<i>Yes, Mr. Edwards.</i>

690
00:46:04,489 --> 00:46:08,516
Call off auditions
for the day. I'm busy.

691
00:46:08,593 --> 00:46:11,528
You know, I always
believed in that girl.

692
00:46:33,718 --> 00:46:37,347
- Lora Meredith!
- Lora Meredith!

693
00:46:37,422 --> 00:46:41,722
<i>Lora Meredith!</i>
<i>Lora Meredith!</i>

694
00:46:55,106 --> 00:46:57,040
Thank you, David.

695
00:46:57,108 --> 00:47:00,805
They applauded me.
Did you hear them?
Why not? You were great!

696
00:47:00,879 --> 00:47:04,508
<i>Author! Author!</i>
Your turn, Mr. Edwards.

697
00:47:04,582 --> 00:47:07,016
Tom, may I borrow
a dime?
Sure.

698
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:10,282
I'll pay you back.
Don't rush. You'll be
around a long time.

699
00:47:10,355 --> 00:47:12,289
I'll be right back.

700
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:22,733
Yes?

701
00:47:22,801 --> 00:47:24,735
Oh, Miss Lora!

702
00:47:25,937 --> 00:47:30,567
- And they liked me too.
- They did? Ohh!

703
00:47:30,642 --> 00:47:33,042
Now, isn't that wonderful?

704
00:47:33,111 --> 00:47:35,773
Do you want Susie?
Yes, please.

705
00:47:35,847 --> 00:47:37,781
Congratulations,
mommy.

706
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:41,683
Congratulations, Mommy.
Did you remember your lines?

707
00:47:41,753 --> 00:47:44,187
Yes, I remembered
all my lines.

708
00:47:44,255 --> 00:47:47,190
Did they clap for you?
Yes, they did.

709
00:47:47,258 --> 00:47:50,955
I'll be home very soon.
I'll only stay
a little while.

710
00:47:51,029 --> 00:47:52,963
Then I'll come
right home.

711
00:47:53,031 --> 00:47:55,226
Here's a kiss,
mommy.
Ohh.

712
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,734
And here's one
for you too. Mmm!

713
00:47:57,802 --> 00:48:01,738
Let's go. The paper's
will be out soon,
and the party's waiting.

714
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:08,245
"This should be
a Pulitzer prize play
for David Edwards,

715
00:48:08,313 --> 00:48:11,180
"for tonight we saw
the ranking comedy
of the season,

716
00:48:11,249 --> 00:48:14,184
marvelously performed
by Geraldine Moore
and Preston Mitchell."

717
00:48:14,252 --> 00:48:16,812
Listen
to the <i>Times.</i>

718
00:48:16,888 --> 00:48:19,322
Atkinson says,
"A new star was born.

719
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:22,917
"Lora Meredith, an actress
who heretofore has been
hiding her light...

720
00:48:22,994 --> 00:48:24,928
"somewhere
in the hinterlands,

721
00:48:24,996 --> 00:48:28,432
gave a great performance
in a small part last night."

722
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,934
Congratulations,
baby.
Thank you, Allen.

723
00:48:31,002 --> 00:48:32,936
<i>Congratulations.</i>
<i>That was really...</i>

724
00:48:33,004 --> 00:48:37,100
Lora, this is
a great night for us.
For <i>us?</i>

725
00:48:37,175 --> 00:48:39,302
Oh. Oh!

726
00:48:39,377 --> 00:48:42,972
Well, I for one can't keep
my beady eyes open anymore.

727
00:48:43,047 --> 00:48:45,481
I'm going home.
<i>Well, good night, David.</i>

728
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:48,417
Good night,
all you lucky people.

729
00:48:48,486 --> 00:48:51,319
Good night.
Good night, dear.

730
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:53,323
Good night.
Good night, David.

731
00:48:53,391 --> 00:48:55,325
Good night, Gerry.
Good night, David.

732
00:48:55,393 --> 00:48:57,327
See you tomorrow.
Good night,
David!

733
00:48:57,395 --> 00:48:59,329
Good night, all!
<i>Good night.</i>

734
00:48:59,397 --> 00:49:02,332
Congratulations again, baby.
We did it, all right.

735
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,836
I'll see you first thing
in the morning,
in my office.

736
00:49:08,072 --> 00:49:10,006
Agents.

737
00:49:10,074 --> 00:49:14,511
By morning it'll be all over
town that he wrote your part,
directed you personally...

738
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:17,980
and was your lover
before you met me.

739
00:49:20,552 --> 00:49:22,816
Well, lady,
there's your new empire.

740
00:49:22,887 --> 00:49:27,187
<i>Not big, just stretches</i>
<i>from 42nd to 52nd street.</i>

741
00:49:27,258 --> 00:49:29,692
But it's
the heart of the world.

742
00:49:31,095 --> 00:49:34,155
You happy?
Oh, yes.

743
00:49:35,433 --> 00:49:37,367
Yes.

744
00:49:38,736 --> 00:49:42,695
I can't thank you...
I can't begin to
thank you for,

745
00:49:42,774 --> 00:49:44,708
for giving me the chance.

746
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:46,710
No thanks.

747
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:48,712
It's something
we did together.

748
00:49:51,449 --> 00:49:53,383
Yes.

749
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:57,212
We'll have more evenings
like this.

750
00:49:57,288 --> 00:50:00,883
More plays.
I promise that.

751
00:50:01,626 --> 00:50:04,060
Please.

752
00:50:04,128 --> 00:50:06,392
And with you,
David.

753
00:50:06,464 --> 00:50:08,398
Always with you.

754
00:50:09,133 --> 00:50:11,067
You are good for me.

755
00:50:15,573 --> 00:50:17,507
You mean that?

756
00:50:17,575 --> 00:50:20,009
Well, you must be,
because I...

757
00:50:20,078 --> 00:50:23,013
I've never felt
this way before.

758
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:26,016
Never so...
So complete...

759
00:50:26,084 --> 00:50:28,518
and so happy.

760
00:50:28,586 --> 00:50:32,522
I don't think
I could be happier
with anyone else either.

761
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:35,024
I'm in love
with you, Lora.

762
00:50:35,093 --> 00:50:39,086
Though I must hasten to add,
I always fall in love
with my leading ladies.

763
00:50:39,163 --> 00:50:41,529
Maybe that's all it is.

764
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,794
But I don't care,

765
00:50:43,868 --> 00:50:46,564
because
I'm loving you now.

766
00:50:46,638 --> 00:50:49,232
You and tonight.

767
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:51,241
Thank you.

768
00:52:05,616 --> 00:52:07,550
Marvelous performance,
darling.

769
00:52:07,618 --> 00:52:10,485
Just as fresh as it was
seven months ago.
Hmm.

770
00:52:10,555 --> 00:52:13,251
Now hurry up
and get ready.
David.

771
00:52:13,324 --> 00:52:17,260
Can't I beg off tonight?
I am so...
Beg off?
Impossible, darling.

772
00:52:17,328 --> 00:52:20,263
Some nice, untouched money
out there from Cincinnati.

773
00:52:20,331 --> 00:52:23,767
Hardware. They want to
meet you to invest in your
success and my next play.

774
00:52:23,835 --> 00:52:27,271
She oughta go to bed now.
Annie, you're much too pretty
to be a watchdog.

775
00:52:27,338 --> 00:52:29,772
And I can bite
sometimes.
Five minutes.

776
00:52:29,841 --> 00:52:33,333
But darling...
While I keep Cincinnati
and the money happy.

777
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:35,845
Doesn't he ever stop?

778
00:52:35,913 --> 00:52:37,847
He can't, Annie.

779
00:52:37,915 --> 00:52:42,352
If he did
he'd be sure to find out
how sad he really is.

780
00:52:43,921 --> 00:52:45,855
And I know that feeling.

781
00:52:47,258 --> 00:52:49,192
Funny, isn't it?

782
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:53,959
After all this time,
the struggling and heartache,

783
00:52:54,032 --> 00:52:56,466
and you make it.

784
00:52:56,534 --> 00:53:00,470
Then you find out
it doesn't seem worth it.

785
00:53:00,538 --> 00:53:02,472
Something is missing.

786
00:53:03,908 --> 00:53:06,342
Now David
wants to marry me.

787
00:53:06,411 --> 00:53:09,141
I don't know.
Do you love him?

788
00:53:10,882 --> 00:53:13,146
No.

789
00:53:13,217 --> 00:53:16,311
But he's good for me
in many ways.

790
00:53:16,387 --> 00:53:19,823
At least I'm trying to
make myself think he is.

791
00:53:19,891 --> 00:53:23,327
And of course it...
It would be better
for Susie.

792
00:53:23,394 --> 00:53:25,828
This ain't no time
to make decisions.

793
00:53:25,897 --> 00:53:28,832
You're tired, and you don't
know what you want.

794
00:53:31,402 --> 00:53:34,337
Maybe I don't want
so much anymore.

795
00:53:34,405 --> 00:53:38,341
But what would you do
if you gave it all up?

796
00:53:38,409 --> 00:53:41,845
Well, I could spend
more time with Susie.

797
00:53:41,913 --> 00:53:44,848
And you could stay home
with Sarah Jane.

798
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:47,851
Do you know,

799
00:53:47,919 --> 00:53:51,355
I haven't been up to see
my baby at school in weeks.

800
00:53:51,422 --> 00:53:53,356
Susie knows you love her.

801
00:53:53,424 --> 00:53:57,360
And you need show business
as much as it needs you.

802
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:03,164
Oh, Annie, what would
I do without you?

803
00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:07,064
Well. Beautiful.

804
00:54:07,138 --> 00:54:09,003
Do you really
like it?

805
00:54:09,073 --> 00:54:12,133
You're more beautiful
than I could ever
possibly remember.

806
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:14,144
And we're late.

807
00:54:14,212 --> 00:54:18,273
Good night, Annie.
You see she gets home
at a decent hour.

808
00:54:28,058 --> 00:54:31,084
Annie, I think
we'll try these,
uh, over here.

809
00:54:31,161 --> 00:54:34,597
Miss Lora, we been
spending an awful lot
of money up here.

810
00:54:34,665 --> 00:54:40,160
Do you think we can really
afford to have this place?
We can't afford not to.

811
00:54:40,237 --> 00:54:42,171
<i>Ma'am? Ma'am?</i>
Oh, um...

812
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:46,676
Would you put it
over there, please?
In front of the window.

813
00:54:51,915 --> 00:54:53,849
Oh, that's fine.

814
00:54:53,917 --> 00:54:56,545
Would you
sign this, ma'am?
Mm-hmm.

815
00:54:59,123 --> 00:55:01,057
Thank you very much.

816
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:03,059
Come on, let's go, Joe.

817
00:55:05,763 --> 00:55:09,631
Did you see the bills
from Susie's new school?
Mm-hmm.

818
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,634
And it doesn't matter.
But Miss Lora...

819
00:55:11,702 --> 00:55:16,139
No matter what it costs,
Susie's going to have
everything that I missed.

820
00:55:16,206 --> 00:55:19,642
From her letters
she misses you more than
she'd ever miss Latin.

821
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,144
She just wrote
and told me...
Annie.

822
00:55:22,212 --> 00:55:25,648
You still haven't told me what
the doctor said about those
spells you've been getting.

823
00:55:25,716 --> 00:55:29,652
What do doctors always say
when they can't find nothin'
wrong? "Take it easy."

824
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,154
Well, do.
And I mean it.
Oh, Miss Lora...

825
00:55:32,222 --> 00:55:35,157
You can have anyone
you want in here
to help you.

826
00:55:35,225 --> 00:55:38,490
Be more work gettin' 'em
out of my way.

827
00:55:38,562 --> 00:55:40,496
<i>I'll get it.</i>

828
00:55:43,067 --> 00:55:45,501
Hello, Mr. Edwards.
Hello, Sarah Jane.

829
00:55:45,569 --> 00:55:47,503
How are you?
Fine, thanks.

830
00:55:47,571 --> 00:55:50,836
I'm going to The Village.
I'll be back by 3:00.

831
00:55:50,908 --> 00:55:54,344
Annie,
that daughter of yours
gets prettier every day.

832
00:55:54,411 --> 00:55:56,345
And so
sophisticated.

833
00:55:56,413 --> 00:55:59,348
Darling.
Hello, dear.

834
00:55:59,416 --> 00:56:01,850
Oh. Nice.
Yes. It's new.

835
00:56:01,919 --> 00:56:03,853
Didn't you get
my messages yesterday?

836
00:56:03,921 --> 00:56:06,355
Or have you given up
telephones?

837
00:56:06,423 --> 00:56:11,861
Uh, well, we've been so busy
getting the house in order.

838
00:56:11,929 --> 00:56:13,863
Come sit down.

839
00:56:16,033 --> 00:56:18,968
Would you like a drink?
A long one. It's quite
a trek from Manhattan.

840
00:56:19,036 --> 00:56:20,970
Your usual?
Uh-huh.

841
00:56:21,038 --> 00:56:23,472
I'll get it.
All right,
enough chitchat.

842
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,633
Have you read
my new play?

843
00:56:25,709 --> 00:56:29,042
Great, isn't it?
Yes, it's very good.

844
00:56:29,113 --> 00:56:31,104
But David...

845
00:56:32,382 --> 00:56:35,317
Darling, I don't think
I should do another comedy.

846
00:56:35,385 --> 00:56:37,319
No, no, wait a minute.

847
00:56:37,387 --> 00:56:42,324
I've decided to do
the new Stewart play.
That? What part?

848
00:56:42,392 --> 00:56:46,328
Not the dull social worker
with the high dreams
and low heels.

849
00:56:46,396 --> 00:56:48,591
Yes.
It's drama.
No clothes, no sex.

850
00:56:48,665 --> 00:56:50,792
No fun!
I know.

851
00:56:50,868 --> 00:56:53,803
But it's a great chance for...
For good acting.

852
00:56:53,871 --> 00:56:56,806
<i>And that colored angle</i>
<i>in it, it's absolutely</i>
<i>controversial.</i>

853
00:56:56,874 --> 00:56:59,399
<i>- What do you know</i>
<i>about controversy?</i>
- Nothing.

854
00:56:59,476 --> 00:57:01,410
And I don't want to know.

855
00:57:01,478 --> 00:57:05,414
I only know it's a good script,
and they're not easy to find.

856
00:57:05,482 --> 00:57:10,351
Besides, I, I feel I need
something different,
a new experience.

857
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,856
<i>All right,</i>
<i>if you want a flop,</i>
<i>have it on your own time.</i>

858
00:57:13,924 --> 00:57:17,360
I wrote my play for you.
I tailored it
to your every mood.

859
00:57:17,427 --> 00:57:20,362
I never wrote
better laughs
in my life!

860
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:23,365
And you tell me
you want controversy.
Hmph!

861
00:57:23,433 --> 00:57:27,369
It may sound ungrateful,
after all you've done for me.

862
00:57:27,437 --> 00:57:29,371
You're right.
It is ungrateful.

863
00:57:29,439 --> 00:57:31,373
But then I never
expected gratitude.

864
00:57:31,441 --> 00:57:34,740
Personally,
I couldn't stand it.

865
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:37,245
May I have
my property back?

866
00:57:37,314 --> 00:57:39,544
Of course.

867
00:57:44,388 --> 00:57:46,322
Good luck, David.

868
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,824
I know
it will be a hit.

869
00:57:48,892 --> 00:57:51,827
It won't without you.

870
00:57:51,895 --> 00:57:54,489
It'll never be done.

871
00:57:54,565 --> 00:57:58,501
Under the circumstances
I think it's best
if I destroy this.

872
00:57:58,569 --> 00:58:01,629
<i>What?</i>
<i>But Mr. Edwards...</i>

873
00:58:01,705 --> 00:58:05,641
There goes my pride,
up in ashes.

874
00:58:05,709 --> 00:58:08,007
Well, good-bye.

875
00:58:08,078 --> 00:58:09,943
What...

876
00:58:10,013 --> 00:58:12,447
Just a theatrical
gesture.

877
00:58:12,516 --> 00:58:15,451
He never makes less
than six copies.

878
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,634
Wasn't she great?

879
00:58:32,702 --> 00:58:35,637
You're going to join us,
aren't you?
No.

880
00:58:35,705 --> 00:58:38,936
Just wish her all the luck
in the world for me.

881
00:58:39,009 --> 00:58:40,943
Tell her
I was wrong.

882
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:47,116
Oh, Annie,
wasn't Mother
just wonderful?

883
00:58:47,183 --> 00:58:51,984
Susie! Susie, wait!
I've got to hurry.
Mama's bringing them all home.

884
00:58:52,055 --> 00:58:54,182
Sarah Jane!

885
00:58:59,262 --> 00:59:01,196
Oh, yes!
Thank you.

886
00:59:01,264 --> 00:59:04,199
Oh, that's very sweet.
Darling,
you were wonderful.

887
00:59:04,267 --> 00:59:07,964
How sweet.
Wasn't it... Steve!

888
00:59:08,038 --> 00:59:11,769
Hello, Lora.
And congratulations.

889
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:14,366
Oh, Steve,
I can't believe it.

890
00:59:14,444 --> 00:59:18,380
Oh, Lora, I'd... I'd like you
to know Louise Morton.
How do you do?

891
00:59:18,448 --> 00:59:21,383
How do you do,
Miss Meredith?
I loved your performance.

892
00:59:21,451 --> 00:59:23,385
Thank you very much.

893
00:59:23,453 --> 00:59:25,444
Um, Steve Archer,
everybody.

894
00:59:25,522 --> 00:59:27,956
How do you do?
<i>How do you do?</i>

895
00:59:28,024 --> 00:59:30,458
A very old
and dear friend.

896
00:59:30,527 --> 00:59:32,791
Oh, and, uh,
Miss Morton.

897
00:59:32,862 --> 00:59:35,296
Hi. Hello.
<i>Nice meeting you.</i>

898
00:59:35,365 --> 00:59:37,458
Oh, Steve,
it's been so long.

899
00:59:37,534 --> 00:59:41,470
Ten years.
Oh, and you haven't
changed a bit.

900
00:59:41,538 --> 00:59:44,473
How are Annie
and the kids?
Oh, Annie's fine.

901
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:48,477
You'd never know
the children, they're
so grown-up and lovely.

902
00:59:48,545 --> 00:59:52,481
Uh, look, we're
all going to my house
to wait for the reviews.

903
00:59:52,549 --> 00:59:55,985
- Why don't you join us?
- Well, let's get going.

904
00:59:56,052 --> 00:59:59,488
<i>You mind us</i>
<i>riding with you folks?</i>
<i>Fine. We have plenty of room.</i>

905
00:59:59,556 --> 01:00:02,491
<i>That'd be nice.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

906
01:00:08,565 --> 01:00:11,500
Mmm. I'm glad
the opening's over.

907
01:00:11,568 --> 01:00:15,504
Now I hope Mother will
have some time for me
before my graduation.

908
01:00:15,572 --> 01:00:19,508
I have a lot of subjects
I wanna discuss with her.
I don't want to forget any.

909
01:00:19,576 --> 01:00:22,511
Annie, do you wanna
hear them?
Sure, honey.

910
01:00:22,579 --> 01:00:26,310
The most important
is Jane Beeler's party.
There are gonna be boys.

911
01:00:26,383 --> 01:00:29,819
And under that
I have an "A" and a "B"
I wanna discuss with Mother.

912
01:00:29,886 --> 01:00:33,822
A... How do I make
a boy like me, and B...
Should I let him kiss me.

913
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:36,825
Isn't that subject
comin' up a little soon?

914
01:00:36,893 --> 01:00:40,056
The girls in school
discuss it all the time.

915
01:00:42,132 --> 01:00:45,101
My goodness!
They're here already!

916
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:50,965
Honey, will you run upstairs
and get Sarah Jane?
All right.

917
01:00:54,711 --> 01:00:56,804
All right, ma'am?
It's wonderful.

918
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,814
Thank you.

919
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:03,586
Annie, are you ready
for a surprise?

920
01:01:05,188 --> 01:01:07,122
Wait till you see
who's here.

921
01:01:08,725 --> 01:01:10,659
Hello, Annie.

922
01:01:10,727 --> 01:01:12,661
Why, Mr. Steve!

923
01:01:12,729 --> 01:01:15,789
Oh, my goodness!
I'll get you
a drink.

924
01:01:15,865 --> 01:01:17,799
You certainly
look fine!

925
01:01:17,867 --> 01:01:20,301
You too, Annie.
How's everything been?

926
01:01:20,370 --> 01:01:22,804
Each day
I count my blessings.

927
01:01:22,872 --> 01:01:26,308
You call doing this
at 1:00 in the morning
a blessing?
Yes, sir.

928
01:01:26,376 --> 01:01:29,812
I can remember when plenty
of ham and eggs was more
than a blessing.

929
01:01:29,879 --> 01:01:31,813
It was a miracle.

930
01:01:31,881 --> 01:01:34,315
Here you are.
Scotch and water.
I remembered.

931
01:01:34,384 --> 01:01:37,319
Thanks, but I'd better
get back to Louise.

932
01:01:37,387 --> 01:01:39,321
She won't even
know you're there.

933
01:01:39,389 --> 01:01:41,823
She's being mesmerized
by Allen Loomis.

934
01:01:41,891 --> 01:01:45,327
Oh, Steve, it's good
to have you here.
I mean it.

935
01:01:45,395 --> 01:01:48,831
Now that we
finally have you back,
we will not let you go.

936
01:01:48,898 --> 01:01:52,334
No, sir, you're
gonna stay with us.
Listen.

937
01:01:52,402 --> 01:01:56,031
I have this Sunday off,
the first Sunday I've had
in weeks.

938
01:01:56,105 --> 01:01:59,905
We're going to drive into
the country for a picnic,
Susie, Sarah Jane and Annie.

939
01:01:59,976 --> 01:02:02,809
How does that sound?
Wonderful.

940
01:02:02,879 --> 01:02:05,905
<i>Steve!</i>
<i>I heard your voice!</i>

941
01:02:05,982 --> 01:02:07,916
Ohh!

942
01:02:07,984 --> 01:02:11,784
This can't be Susie.
So pretty, and not
little anymore.

943
01:02:11,855 --> 01:02:14,790
Little?
Why, I'm graduating
in two weeks!

944
01:02:14,858 --> 01:02:17,918
You'll come, won't you?
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

945
01:02:17,994 --> 01:02:19,928
Sarah Jane,
look who's here.

946
01:02:21,598 --> 01:02:24,294
Sarah Jane?
Hello, Steve.

947
01:02:25,368 --> 01:02:28,804
It can't be.
Why, you were all legs.

948
01:02:28,872 --> 01:02:32,035
I still have them.
Yes, but they
came up to here.

949
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:37,511
Steve, don't ever
go away from us again.
Will you promise?

950
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:40,674
<i>Well, are we holding</i>
<i>the party in here?</i>
<i>Hi, Annie, Sarah Jane.</i>

951
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,684
No, Allen,
we're coming right out.

952
01:02:47,624 --> 01:02:50,889
What a surprise
to see you.
Wonderful
to see you again.

953
01:02:52,929 --> 01:02:56,865
You have an open invitation
to come here any time you can
get away from Madison avenue.

954
01:02:56,933 --> 01:02:59,902
Oh, yes, not just anytime,
but all the time.
Come on.

955
01:02:59,969 --> 01:03:02,597
Even though it is
a long drive.

956
01:03:02,672 --> 01:03:07,609
You forget I used to walk up
three flights of stairs to
see you in the old days.

957
01:03:07,677 --> 01:03:10,544
Oh, Mama, look!
A falling star!

958
01:03:15,718 --> 01:03:18,209
The food's on.

959
01:03:18,288 --> 01:03:20,415
Excuse me.

960
01:03:25,995 --> 01:03:28,589
Did you wish on it?
Mm-hmm.

961
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:34,269
I wish it could always
be like tonight.

962
01:03:34,337 --> 01:03:37,272
All of us together.
Don't you?

963
01:03:39,509 --> 01:03:41,443
Yes, my darling.

964
01:03:42,779 --> 01:03:46,215
And I'm going to
do something about it.

965
01:03:46,282 --> 01:03:50,446
I will not do another play
for a long, long time.

966
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:53,819
Ohh, Mama!
Come in.

967
01:04:07,870 --> 01:04:09,735
We're goin' now,
honey.

968
01:04:09,806 --> 01:04:13,742
If that headache ain't gone
in an hour's time,
you take another aspirin.

969
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:16,904
You hear?
Yes, Mama.
Have a good time.

970
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:19,414
Mama.
Yes, baby?

971
01:04:19,482 --> 01:04:23,578
Tell 'em I'm... I'm sorry
I had to miss the picnic.

972
01:04:23,653 --> 01:04:25,587
Okay. Okay.

973
01:04:44,674 --> 01:04:48,110
But by the time I find Steve
the fire'll be just perfect.

974
01:04:48,177 --> 01:04:51,146
You let them alone.
Maybe they got things
to talk about.

975
01:04:51,214 --> 01:04:53,148
This is
a fine picnic.

976
01:04:53,216 --> 01:04:58,153
Sarah Jane announces
she's getting the flu.
Mom and Steve just go off.

977
01:04:58,221 --> 01:05:02,658
Oh, well, if this is the way
it's gonna be, I might as
well get on with my list.

978
01:05:02,725 --> 01:05:07,662
I can cross off pink sweater
for Elizabeth and yellow
sweater for Sarah Jane.

979
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:09,664
Then we skip ahead
to algebra.

980
01:05:09,732 --> 01:05:13,668
Do you think another year of
that stuff is a good idea?
I sure do.

981
01:05:13,736 --> 01:05:17,172
It's gonna come in
mighty handy with prices
always goin' up.

982
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,674
Which brings us
back to boys.

983
01:05:19,742 --> 01:05:22,677
What do you think
about kissing, Annie?

984
01:05:22,745 --> 01:05:26,442
Well, there's kissin'
and <i>kissin'.</i>

985
01:05:26,516 --> 01:05:29,451
I still take pictures
every chance I get.

986
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:31,953
Still trying
to get them exhibited.
Stop hedging.

987
01:05:32,021 --> 01:05:33,955
What is your job,
really?

988
01:05:34,023 --> 01:05:36,958
I'm Vice President
in Charge of Advertising
for P.C. Beer.

989
01:05:37,026 --> 01:05:39,961
Don't tell anybody.
Why not?
I think it's wonderful.

990
01:05:40,029 --> 01:05:44,728
'Cause I'm quitting
just as soon as I can
wind things up.
But why?

991
01:05:44,801 --> 01:05:48,237
You ever get the feeling
that you're tired of
what you're doing,

992
01:05:48,304 --> 01:05:50,738
that it isn't all
you really wanted?

993
01:05:50,807 --> 01:05:54,743
Did you ever get the urge
not to do what you don't
want to do?

994
01:05:54,811 --> 01:05:58,747
To let yourself go
and follow the wind
or a star,

995
01:05:58,815 --> 01:06:01,249
maybe even
a dusty old rainbow?

996
01:06:01,317 --> 01:06:03,251
Yes.

997
01:06:03,319 --> 01:06:05,253
Well, that's why
I'm going.

998
01:06:05,321 --> 01:06:07,255
Where to?

999
01:06:07,323 --> 01:06:10,690
I don't know.
Around the world,
I guess, for a start.

1000
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,694
You going alone?

1001
01:06:12,762 --> 01:06:17,324
I'm afraid so, I...
I went through my entire
little black book.

1002
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:20,335
Well, you shouldn't have
skipped my name.

1003
01:06:21,437 --> 01:06:25,271
I... I don't know why
I said that, Steve,

1004
01:06:25,341 --> 01:06:28,777
except that
I haven't been this happy
with anyone for years.

1005
01:06:28,845 --> 01:06:33,407
You know I still have you
in my blood, don't you?
Oh, Steve, do you really?

1006
01:06:34,984 --> 01:06:37,418
I never got over you,
Lora.

1007
01:06:37,487 --> 01:06:40,581
No matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't.

1008
01:06:43,493 --> 01:06:46,929
There's a kind of kissin'
that's not careless
and doesn't lead to harm,

1009
01:06:46,996 --> 01:06:49,931
when the two people kissin'
are nice and right.

1010
01:06:49,999 --> 01:06:51,933
Kissin' is part of
fallin' in love.

1011
01:06:52,001 --> 01:06:54,435
The Lord
wants his children
to fall in love,

1012
01:06:54,504 --> 01:06:56,938
when they're old enough
and got sense enough.

1013
01:06:57,006 --> 01:06:59,941
Then kissin' is like
yeast is to bread...

1014
01:07:00,009 --> 01:07:03,604
Pardon me, Annie,
but I'm starving.
Can't I please find Steve?

1015
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:05,613
Don't think
you'll have to.

1016
01:07:05,681 --> 01:07:09,549
Steve! It's time
to cook the steaks!
Even Annie says so!

1017
01:07:11,621 --> 01:07:14,556
Telling them
will be wonderful,
but Loomis, ohh.

1018
01:07:14,624 --> 01:07:18,560
Why tell him at all?
He has a lot of commitments
he'll have to get me out of.

1019
01:07:18,628 --> 01:07:21,893
<i>Susie, will you go see</i>
<i>how Sarah Jane is?</i>

1020
01:07:21,964 --> 01:07:24,728
Tell her
I'll be right up.
Okay.

1021
01:07:26,035 --> 01:07:29,562
Let me help you
with that.
Thank you, honey.

1022
01:07:32,642 --> 01:07:35,167
Hello, Allen?
I...

1023
01:07:36,245 --> 01:07:38,179
You've been trying
to call me?

1024
01:07:38,247 --> 01:07:40,681
I'm sorry.
We've been out all day.

1025
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:43,241
<i>When?</i>

1026
01:07:43,319 --> 01:07:47,756
Oh. Well, that sounds
simply marvelous, but...

1027
01:07:47,824 --> 01:07:50,759
Uh, no, not for dinner.
I'm having guests.

1028
01:07:52,094 --> 01:07:55,029
Why don't you bring him
for cocktails.

1029
01:07:55,097 --> 01:07:57,588
Yes. All right.

1030
01:07:59,335 --> 01:08:02,532
Steve!
Amerigo Felluci!

1031
01:08:02,605 --> 01:08:05,073
The Italian
movie director.
<i>Yes.</i>

1032
01:08:05,141 --> 01:08:09,601
Oh, he wants me
for the part of Rena
in <i>No More Laughter.</i>

1033
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:14,013
<i>His agent is in New York</i>
<i>now to talk to me about it.</i>
I see.

1034
01:08:14,083 --> 01:08:17,519
- That means you'd
have to go to Italy.
- Mmm. Of course.

1035
01:08:18,754 --> 01:08:20,688
Oh.

1036
01:08:22,124 --> 01:08:25,890
Well, I'll have to
give a two-week notice
to the play.

1037
01:08:25,962 --> 01:08:28,226
Yes.

1038
01:08:28,297 --> 01:08:30,458
Well,
don't be so calm.

1039
01:08:30,533 --> 01:08:32,467
They want me
for Rena!

1040
01:08:32,535 --> 01:08:36,972
Well, who is she?
Only the best part
since Scarlett O'Hara.

1041
01:08:41,177 --> 01:08:44,078
Sarah Jane?

1042
01:09:04,433 --> 01:09:07,368
Sarah Jane!
Where have you been?

1043
01:09:07,436 --> 01:09:11,372
I've been looking all over
for you! You're supposed
to be in bed...
Shh!

1044
01:09:18,514 --> 01:09:20,448
Uh...

1045
01:09:20,516 --> 01:09:22,450
Sit down.

1046
01:09:24,353 --> 01:09:26,287
Cross your heart.

1047
01:09:27,823 --> 01:09:30,758
You won't tell my mama?
No, I won't
tell Annie.

1048
01:09:30,826 --> 01:09:33,260
W-Well, what is it?

1049
01:09:34,196 --> 01:09:36,130
I've been out.

1050
01:09:37,233 --> 01:09:39,599
With my boyfriend.

1051
01:09:39,668 --> 01:09:43,604
Boyfriend?
I didn't know
you had a boyfriend!

1052
01:09:43,672 --> 01:09:46,800
- Where's he from?
- The Village.

1053
01:09:46,876 --> 01:09:50,312
Oh. Did you meet him
in school?
<i>School?</i>

1054
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:53,314
No.

1055
01:09:53,382 --> 01:09:56,317
There's an ice cream
parlor in The Village
with a jukebox.

1056
01:09:56,385 --> 01:09:59,548
Yeah?
And he used to
stand outside,

1057
01:09:59,622 --> 01:10:03,888
and every time I'd walk by,
he'd whistle!
No kidding!

1058
01:10:03,959 --> 01:10:07,895
But first I pretended he
wasn't on earth.
Yeah?

1059
01:10:07,963 --> 01:10:10,898
But finally I had to laugh,
and he followed me.

1060
01:10:10,966 --> 01:10:13,400
And we started to talk.

1061
01:10:13,469 --> 01:10:16,802
He's cute.
<i>Really</i> cute.

1062
01:10:16,872 --> 01:10:18,806
Is he a colored boy?

1063
01:10:18,874 --> 01:10:22,139
Why did you ask that?
Well, I don't know.

1064
01:10:22,211 --> 01:10:25,146
It just slipped out.
It was the first thing
you thought of.

1065
01:10:25,214 --> 01:10:28,149
I told you,
it just slipped out!
Well, he's white.

1066
01:10:28,217 --> 01:10:33,154
And if he ever finds out
about me, I'll kill myself.
But why?

1067
01:10:33,222 --> 01:10:36,953
Because I'm white too.
And if I have to be colored,
then I want to die.

1068
01:10:37,026 --> 01:10:39,995
What are you saying?
I wanna have
a chance in life.

1069
01:10:40,062 --> 01:10:43,657
I don't wanna have to
come through back doors,
feel lower than other people,

1070
01:10:43,732 --> 01:10:46,667
or apologize
for my mother's color.
Don't say that!

1071
01:10:46,735 --> 01:10:49,898
She can't help her color,
but I can.

1072
01:10:49,972 --> 01:10:51,906
And I will.

1073
01:10:51,974 --> 01:10:54,408
But we've always
talked things over.

1074
01:10:54,476 --> 01:10:57,104
You never told me
this before.

1075
01:11:01,183 --> 01:11:04,118
Because I've never had
a boyfriend before.

1076
01:11:05,688 --> 01:11:08,555
Because he wants to
marry me someday.

1077
01:11:10,059 --> 01:11:12,994
A white boy.
Me.

1078
01:11:13,062 --> 01:11:17,795
But how do you think
he'd feel, or his folks,
with a black in-law?

1079
01:11:17,866 --> 01:11:21,802
What do you think people
would say where we lived
if they knew my mother...

1080
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:26,068
They'd spit at me.
And my children.

1081
01:11:26,141 --> 01:11:29,076
Sarah Jane,
you know that's not true!
It is.

1082
01:11:29,144 --> 01:11:31,578
That's why
he mustn't know her.

1083
01:11:31,647 --> 01:11:34,081
I don't want anybody
to know her.

1084
01:11:34,149 --> 01:11:38,085
What if he comes here?
He doesn't even know
where I live.

1085
01:11:38,153 --> 01:11:41,589
I pretend I'm a...
I'm a rich girl
with strict parents.

1086
01:11:41,657 --> 01:11:44,285
Well, he's bound
to find out...
How?

1087
01:11:45,594 --> 01:11:48,586
I'm going to be everything
he thinks I am.

1088
01:11:48,664 --> 01:11:51,827
I look it, and that's
all that matters.

1089
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:55,336
And you're not to say
anything either.
I won't. You know I won't.

1090
01:11:55,404 --> 01:11:57,338
I never did, but...

1091
01:11:57,406 --> 01:12:01,001
Sarah Jane,
if Mama ever found out
she'd never stand for it.

1092
01:12:01,076 --> 01:12:03,010
I don't care.

1093
01:12:04,546 --> 01:12:06,980
Your mother
doesn't own me.

1094
01:12:09,018 --> 01:12:12,317
I won't be seeing you
before you leave,
so good luck in Italy.

1095
01:12:12,388 --> 01:12:14,322
You make that sound
like good-bye.

1096
01:12:14,390 --> 01:12:17,325
Why couldn't
we meet in Italy?
What for?

1097
01:12:17,393 --> 01:12:20,658
You'll have a film.
You won't need me.

1098
01:12:20,729 --> 01:12:22,663
But Steve, wait.

1099
01:12:22,731 --> 01:12:26,963
You tell Susie I'll
be at her graduation.
Good-bye, Lora.

1100
01:12:45,614 --> 01:12:47,775
Oh, Sarah Jane.
Yes, Miss Lora?

1101
01:12:47,850 --> 01:12:50,785
I'm having
some people come
for a business meeting.

1102
01:12:50,853 --> 01:12:54,789
Later the dinner guests
will arrive. Could you
help your mother a bit?

1103
01:12:54,857 --> 01:12:57,724
Miss Lora,
I... I-I'd like to,
but I have a...

1104
01:12:57,793 --> 01:13:01,160
A date?
Is it the Hawkins boy?

1105
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,164
Hawkins?

1106
01:13:03,232 --> 01:13:06,963
<i>Well, the Miller's chauffeur</i>
<i>down the road.</i>
Why do you say that?

1107
01:13:07,036 --> 01:13:10,563
I met him at the station
the other day
and he asked about you.

1108
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:13,574
No.
It's with someone else.

1109
01:13:13,642 --> 01:13:15,576
Oh.

1110
01:13:15,644 --> 01:13:19,080
All right, you run along.
I'll try to manage here.

1111
01:13:19,148 --> 01:13:21,082
Oh, there they are.

1112
01:13:32,027 --> 01:13:36,054
Look, honey, why don't you
go over to the party
at the church?

1113
01:13:36,131 --> 01:13:38,065
They bore me.

1114
01:13:38,133 --> 01:13:43,070
You're makin' a big mistake.
You're young. You shouldn't
be sittin' around.

1115
01:13:43,138 --> 01:13:45,072
Miss Lora
feels the same way.

1116
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:50,077
She'll lend you
her car.
Oh, she will?
How nice of her.

1117
01:13:50,145 --> 01:13:53,080
I'd be happy knowin'
you're meetin'
nice young folks.

1118
01:13:53,148 --> 01:13:56,083
Busboys, cooks,
chauffeurs!

1119
01:13:56,151 --> 01:13:59,086
Hmph.
Like Hawkins.

1120
01:13:59,154 --> 01:14:02,590
No, thank you.
I've seen your
"nice young folks."

1121
01:14:03,726 --> 01:14:06,661
I don't wanna fight
with you, honey.

1122
01:14:06,729 --> 01:14:08,594
Not tonight.

1123
01:14:08,664 --> 01:14:10,598
I don't feel too good.

1124
01:14:10,666 --> 01:14:13,100
While I get started
on the anchovies,

1125
01:14:13,168 --> 01:14:16,103
will you take this tray
into Miss Lora
and her friends?

1126
01:14:16,171 --> 01:14:18,105
Why, certainly.

1127
01:14:18,173 --> 01:14:21,108
Anything at all
for Miss Lora
and her friends.

1128
01:14:23,879 --> 01:14:27,315
But signor Romano, why should
she need rehearsals?
<i>Ma scusa, signor.</i>

1129
01:14:27,383 --> 01:14:29,317
You know her work.

1130
01:14:29,385 --> 01:14:32,013
Felluci always insists
on two weeks' rehearsal.

1131
01:14:32,087 --> 01:14:35,750
Pictures are a different
medium than the stage.
She will need rehearsal...

1132
01:14:38,327 --> 01:14:42,491
Fetched y'all a mess
of crawdads, Miss Lora,
for you and yo' friends.

1133
01:14:42,564 --> 01:14:46,557
That's quite a trick,
Sarah Jane.
Where did you learn it?

1134
01:14:46,635 --> 01:14:49,069
Oh, no trick to totin',
Miss Lora.

1135
01:14:49,138 --> 01:14:51,072
I learned it
from my mammy,

1136
01:14:51,140 --> 01:14:55,076
and she learned it
from old massa 'fore
she belonged to you.

1137
01:14:58,981 --> 01:15:00,915
Well...
Excuse me.

1138
01:15:05,921 --> 01:15:07,855
Another drink,
Sr. Romano?

1139
01:15:09,725 --> 01:15:13,161
Sarah Jane,
why did you do that?

1140
01:15:13,228 --> 01:15:15,662
What's the matter
with you?

1141
01:15:15,731 --> 01:15:18,996
Annie, did you see
what she did?
I heard her.

1142
01:15:19,068 --> 01:15:22,504
You and my mother
are so anxious for me
to be colored.

1143
01:15:23,572 --> 01:15:27,008
I was going to show you
I could be.

1144
01:15:32,081 --> 01:15:34,379
You weren't being
colored.

1145
01:15:34,450 --> 01:15:36,384
You were being
childish.

1146
01:15:36,452 --> 01:15:40,388
I don't understand why
you would want to hurt
your mother or me.

1147
01:15:40,456 --> 01:15:43,391
I told her
she has to be patient.

1148
01:15:43,459 --> 01:15:45,393
Things will work out.
How?

1149
01:15:47,362 --> 01:15:50,729
Miss Lora, you don't know
what it means to be...

1150
01:15:50,799 --> 01:15:52,733
different.

1151
01:15:52,801 --> 01:15:57,465
Have I ever treated you
as if you were different?
Has Susie? Has anyone here?

1152
01:15:59,775 --> 01:16:01,743
No.

1153
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:03,744
You've been wonderful,
but...

1154
01:16:03,812 --> 01:16:06,747
Then don't ever do this
to us again.

1155
01:16:06,815 --> 01:16:08,680
Or to yourself.

1156
01:16:10,419 --> 01:16:12,853
It won't solve anything,
Sarah Jane.

1157
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,174
Mama?

1158
01:16:34,409 --> 01:16:36,343
Oh, please.

1159
01:16:37,746 --> 01:16:39,680
Try to understand.

1160
01:16:40,916 --> 01:16:44,010
I-I didn't mean
to hurt you.

1161
01:16:44,086 --> 01:16:46,020
I love you.

1162
01:16:46,088 --> 01:16:48,682
Oh, I know, baby.

1163
01:16:48,757 --> 01:16:52,887
You're just like
a puppy that's been
cooped up too much.

1164
01:16:54,062 --> 01:16:57,998
That's why I wanted you
to go to the party.

1165
01:16:59,434 --> 01:17:01,868
Oh, Mama.

1166
01:17:01,937 --> 01:17:04,371
Don't you see
that won't help?

1167
01:17:24,328 --> 01:17:26,262
<i>Lora, wait a minute.</i>

1168
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:29,265
<i>I didn't mean the whole thing.</i>
<i>I said...</i>

1169
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:32,268
<i>Sr. Romano, she won't</i>
<i>need rehearsal.</i>

1170
01:17:40,911 --> 01:17:43,505
Frankie, you're late.

1171
01:17:44,582 --> 01:17:47,016
I thought
you'd never get here.

1172
01:17:48,752 --> 01:17:51,687
Let's walk down
by the river.

1173
01:17:51,755 --> 01:17:53,848
I wanna talk to you.

1174
01:17:53,924 --> 01:17:55,858
We can talk here.

1175
01:17:55,926 --> 01:17:58,724
Frankie, I'm...

1176
01:17:58,796 --> 01:18:00,730
I'm having
trouble at home.

1177
01:18:00,798 --> 01:18:03,699
Your mother?
Yes.

1178
01:18:03,767 --> 01:18:08,534
Frankie, you said
you wanted to take
a job in Jersey.

1179
01:18:08,606 --> 01:18:10,506
Couldn't we run away?

1180
01:18:10,574 --> 01:18:13,975
I'd do anything
to be with you,
anything.

1181
01:18:14,044 --> 01:18:16,478
That's not a bad idea.

1182
01:18:16,547 --> 01:18:19,482
That's not
a bad idea at all.

1183
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:21,643
Just tell me
one thing.
Yes?

1184
01:18:21,719 --> 01:18:23,653
Is it true?

1185
01:18:23,721 --> 01:18:25,655
Is what true?

1186
01:18:25,723 --> 01:18:28,157
Is your mother
a nigger?

1187
01:18:28,225 --> 01:18:30,489
Tell me.

1188
01:18:30,561 --> 01:18:32,995
Tell me!
What difference
does it make?
You love me!

1189
01:18:33,063 --> 01:18:35,998
All the kids talking
behind my back!
Is it true?

1190
01:18:36,066 --> 01:18:38,000
No!
Are you black?

1191
01:18:38,068 --> 01:18:40,002
I'm as white as you!
You're lying!

1192
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:42,004
No, I'm not!
You're lying!

1193
01:18:42,072 --> 01:18:45,235
No, I'm not!
I'm not!
You are! You're lying!

1194
01:18:45,309 --> 01:18:47,573
Don't hit me!

1195
01:18:53,584 --> 01:18:55,518
I'm not.

1196
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,174
Mmm.

1197
01:19:18,242 --> 01:19:20,676
Oh, that felt so good.

1198
01:19:20,744 --> 01:19:23,679
And I'm glad
the guests have gone.

1199
01:19:23,747 --> 01:19:26,682
I'm glad you're not
going to Italy.
So am I.

1200
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:29,685
Felluci wanted me
in Rome in one week.

1201
01:19:29,753 --> 01:19:33,189
But I won't miss
Susie's graduation,
not for anything.

1202
01:19:33,257 --> 01:19:35,316
You know,
I can't believe it.

1203
01:19:35,392 --> 01:19:38,327
Susie and Sarah Jane
all grown up.

1204
01:19:39,897 --> 01:19:43,333
You and I have gone
through a lot together,
haven't we?

1205
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:46,836
The years are flyin'.
I'm getting old.

1206
01:19:46,904 --> 01:19:50,271
You never sounded
so solemn before.

1207
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:54,401
Don't you feel well,
Annie?
Oh, just
a little tired.

1208
01:19:54,478 --> 01:19:57,413
Well, do you need anything?
Any money?

1209
01:19:57,481 --> 01:20:00,416
No, Miss Lora.
Thanks to you,
I'm well fixed.

1210
01:20:00,484 --> 01:20:03,419
I've plenty to send
Sarah Jane to college,

1211
01:20:03,487 --> 01:20:07,423
something set aside for her,
and enough for my funeral.
Oh, Annie.

1212
01:20:07,491 --> 01:20:09,925
That funeral again.
Well, I'm gettin' on.

1213
01:20:09,993 --> 01:20:12,928
That's the one thing
I've always wanted
to splurge on.

1214
01:20:12,996 --> 01:20:14,930
I really want it elegant.

1215
01:20:14,998 --> 01:20:19,935
Got it written down the way I
want it to be, all the friends
I'd like to have there.

1216
01:20:20,003 --> 01:20:22,938
It never occurred to me
that you had many friends.

1217
01:20:23,006 --> 01:20:27,443
You never have any visit you.
I know lots of people.
Oh, hundreds.

1218
01:20:27,511 --> 01:20:30,446
Really?
I belong to
the baptist church.

1219
01:20:30,514 --> 01:20:34,712
And I belong
to several lodges too.
I didn't know.

1220
01:20:34,785 --> 01:20:37,845
Miss Lora,
you never asked.

1221
01:20:39,022 --> 01:20:41,456
Mama, Annie, quick!
It's Sarah Jane!

1222
01:20:41,525 --> 01:20:43,459
Oh!

1223
01:20:48,998 --> 01:20:52,331
Sarah Jane!
Oh, my baby!

1224
01:20:52,402 --> 01:20:55,599
Get some water and towels.
What happened, baby?
What happened?

1225
01:20:55,671 --> 01:20:58,697
Leave me alone.
Honey, who did this
to you?

1226
01:20:58,775 --> 01:21:00,709
Tell me!
Leave me alone!

1227
01:21:00,777 --> 01:21:02,711
You've got to
tell me!
Who was it?

1228
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:07,581
It was her boyfriend.
Boyfriend?

1229
01:21:07,650 --> 01:21:11,177
Yes. He found out
I'm not white,

1230
01:21:11,254 --> 01:21:14,246
because you keep telling
the world I'm your daughter.

1231
01:21:14,323 --> 01:21:17,019
Anything you can spoil,
you spoil!

1232
01:21:17,093 --> 01:21:19,459
Stop that.
Stop it!

1233
01:21:19,529 --> 01:21:21,622
Don't you talk
to your mother like that.

1234
01:21:21,697 --> 01:21:25,133
I told you.
Lies don't help none.

1235
01:21:25,201 --> 01:21:27,135
This always happens
when you lie.

1236
01:21:27,203 --> 01:21:29,637
It wouldn't if you
weren't always around!

1237
01:21:37,246 --> 01:21:38,873
Thank you.

1238
01:21:38,948 --> 01:21:41,815
Are you sure Annie
will make it in time?
Honey, you know Annie.

1239
01:21:41,884 --> 01:21:44,352
If she says she will,
she will.

1240
01:21:44,420 --> 01:21:46,684
Oh, Mama, I'm so happy.

1241
01:21:46,756 --> 01:21:50,692
You know, I never really
believed you'd be here.

1242
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:52,694
Are you sorry
about the picture?

1243
01:21:54,597 --> 01:21:58,431
I'm only sorry I couldn't
bring your present with me,
but he's a little bit too big.

1244
01:21:58,501 --> 01:22:00,435
He? Who's he?
Who's too big?

1245
01:22:00,503 --> 01:22:03,199
That thoroughbred
you told me about,
the one you love so?
Yeah?

1246
01:22:03,272 --> 01:22:05,832
Well, he's waiting
for you at home.
You mean he's mine?

1247
01:22:05,908 --> 01:22:07,876
Yes!
Oh, Mama, thank you!

1248
01:22:07,944 --> 01:22:10,105
Happy graduation, angel.

1249
01:22:14,350 --> 01:22:16,477
Oh, Mama, look!
It's Annie.

1250
01:22:18,588 --> 01:22:20,818
<i>And Steve!</i>

1251
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:23,017
Steve!

1252
01:22:24,093 --> 01:22:26,687
<i>Hi!</i>
Susie!

1253
01:22:26,762 --> 01:22:29,356
Oh, and Annie,
I'm so glad you've made it.

1254
01:22:29,432 --> 01:22:31,366
Steve, you're such
a darling to come.

1255
01:22:31,434 --> 01:22:35,700
I meant it when I said
I wouldn't miss it for the...
Lora!

1256
01:22:36,939 --> 01:22:40,067
Hello, Steve.
I thought you were
in Italy.

1257
01:22:40,142 --> 01:22:43,134
Annie, why didn't
you tell me?
Slipped my mind, I'm afraid.

1258
01:22:43,212 --> 01:22:45,407
This came for you
this mornin'.
Oh.

1259
01:22:45,481 --> 01:22:47,915
Honey, Sarah Jane's
much better.
I'm glad.

1260
01:22:47,984 --> 01:22:50,418
She's sorry
she couldn't come,
but she sends her love.

1261
01:22:50,486 --> 01:22:53,853
I think I'm gonna faint.
This is the most exciting
day of my entire life.

1262
01:22:53,923 --> 01:22:56,050
I never expected
you'd all be here.

1263
01:22:56,125 --> 01:22:58,923
Oh, it's...
It's from Felluci.

1264
01:22:58,995 --> 01:23:02,431
He still wants me
for the part, and he'll
wait after all.

1265
01:23:02,498 --> 01:23:05,956
<i>He's even made</i>
<i>my plane reservations.</i>
<i>I'm to leave in two weeks.</i>

1266
01:23:06,035 --> 01:23:08,629
Two weeks?
Oh, Mama.

1267
01:23:08,704 --> 01:23:13,004
Oh! At least that time
will be ours together.

1268
01:23:13,075 --> 01:23:17,011
Oh, don't look like that.
Felluci agreed to my terms.

1269
01:23:17,079 --> 01:23:20,674
I can't turn him down now.
I know, Mother,
I know.

1270
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:24,015
Look, honey, your mama
feels worse than you.

1271
01:23:24,086 --> 01:23:27,954
Girls, the exercises
are beginning. Come on!

1272
01:23:28,024 --> 01:23:29,958
Darling.

1273
01:23:36,599 --> 01:23:38,658
When do you leave, Steve?

1274
01:23:38,734 --> 01:23:42,033
I don't know when I'll
be able to get away now.
Oh.

1275
01:23:42,104 --> 01:23:44,231
Would you do me a favor?

1276
01:23:44,307 --> 01:23:48,573
Will you look after my child
for me while I'm gone?
Please?

1277
01:23:48,644 --> 01:23:51,807
I can think of nothing
I'd like better.

1278
01:24:01,490 --> 01:24:03,981
All right?
Fine. Let's ride
down to the river.

1279
01:24:06,829 --> 01:24:08,763
Thank you.

1280
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:36,024
Isn't this fun?

1281
01:24:36,092 --> 01:24:38,788
I wrote Mother last week
and told her you were riding
like Audie Murphy.

1282
01:24:38,861 --> 01:24:41,022
I'll wear my six-shooters
tomorrow morning.

1283
01:24:41,097 --> 01:24:43,156
And your black tie
tomorrow night at Bocce's.

1284
01:24:43,232 --> 01:24:45,666
Did we make it
definitely tomorrow?
You said Monday night.

1285
01:24:45,735 --> 01:24:48,169
I hope you won't
be disappointed.
It's nothing glamorous.

1286
01:24:48,237 --> 01:24:52,037
Disappointed with you, Steve?
Never. Come on, I'll race you
back to the old mill.

1287
01:25:03,653 --> 01:25:05,917
I hope you won't
be disappointed.

1288
01:25:05,988 --> 01:25:08,218
Oh, no. I think
it's romantic.

1289
01:25:08,290 --> 01:25:10,724
Good evening.
A table for two?
Please.

1290
01:25:16,966 --> 01:25:21,198
What a wonderful place
to end a perfect evening.
I'll have cognac and...

1291
01:25:21,270 --> 01:25:24,205
Could I have one too?
Just once?
Mm-mmm.

1292
01:25:24,273 --> 01:25:26,434
Maybe a little wine?
No.

1293
01:25:26,509 --> 01:25:30,377
Coke. You don't want them
to lose their license,
do you?

1294
01:25:30,446 --> 01:25:33,176
No, of course not,
but...
Shall we dance?

1295
01:25:33,249 --> 01:25:35,683
Dance?
Oh, I'd love to, Steve.

1296
01:25:40,423 --> 01:25:43,620
You know,
you're the only one that
I can talk seriously with.

1297
01:25:43,693 --> 01:25:47,060
What about Annie?
I thought she was everybody's
Rock of Gibraltar.

1298
01:25:47,129 --> 01:25:51,293
She still treats me
like I was a child, as if
I were just out of rompers.

1299
01:25:51,367 --> 01:25:54,302
You don't.
Well, you're
almost a woman.

1300
01:25:54,370 --> 01:25:56,565
Almost?

1301
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:01,167
Anytime you have anything
serious on your mind,
you try it out on me.

1302
01:26:01,243 --> 01:26:05,805
Well, I...
I do have a problem
that's been bothering me.

1303
01:26:05,881 --> 01:26:08,076
Let's have it.

1304
01:26:08,150 --> 01:26:10,812
No. Maybe I shouldn't.

1305
01:26:10,886 --> 01:26:12,911
I'll bet I know
what it's about.

1306
01:26:12,988 --> 01:26:14,956
You do?

1307
01:26:15,024 --> 01:26:17,515
Boys.
Oh, no.

1308
01:26:17,593 --> 01:26:20,824
You were teasing me.
Yes.

1309
01:26:20,896 --> 01:26:25,492
Steve, what's the proper
age for people to...

1310
01:26:25,568 --> 01:26:27,536
Well, to get married?

1311
01:26:27,603 --> 01:26:30,970
That is a problem.
I'm no authority.

1312
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:34,032
Isn't being in love enough?

1313
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:36,943
As long as it's
on both sides.

1314
01:26:37,012 --> 01:26:40,504
But then at your age,
there's always
the possibility of...

1315
01:26:40,583 --> 01:26:42,983
being in love with love.
No.

1316
01:26:43,052 --> 01:26:45,520
No, it's real.
I am.

1317
01:26:45,588 --> 01:26:47,522
In love?
Mm-hmm.

1318
01:26:47,590 --> 01:26:50,388
Wanna talk about it?
Well, I...

1319
01:26:50,459 --> 01:26:52,393
No. Not yet.

1320
01:26:56,665 --> 01:27:00,726
Sometimes though, I...
I feel awfully lonely.

1321
01:27:00,803 --> 01:27:03,829
Love is always a little
lonely in the beginning,

1322
01:27:03,906 --> 01:27:07,307
especially when you're
not sure the other party
feels as you do.

1323
01:27:07,376 --> 01:27:10,345
But it's heavenly, though.
Don't you agree?
I do.

1324
01:27:10,412 --> 01:27:12,846
Marvelous.
No substitute for it.

1325
01:27:15,383 --> 01:27:18,318
Oh, I'm so glad I'm alive.
I've never been so glad before.

1326
01:27:18,386 --> 01:27:20,820
Every time we've been together,
it's been just perfect!

1327
01:27:20,889 --> 01:27:24,484
You ought to go out more
with friends your own age.
Than go out with Steve?

1328
01:27:24,559 --> 01:27:29,394
Annie, you can't believe
how much we have in common.

1329
01:27:29,464 --> 01:27:32,092
Oh, it's Steve!
Now, you're not going out
without a coat.

1330
01:27:32,167 --> 01:27:35,102
I was going to
borrow one of Mother's.
Steve's seen all of mine.

1331
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:38,105
Sarah Jane bought
herself a new one.
You can wear hers.

1332
01:27:38,173 --> 01:27:41,108
Oh, I'll be right down!

1333
01:27:42,677 --> 01:27:45,111
Annie, I haven't seen
Sarah Jane in weeks.

1334
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:47,808
Does she like that new job
in New York?

1335
01:27:47,882 --> 01:27:49,873
Oh, yes.
Thank you.

1336
01:27:49,951 --> 01:27:52,511
The Head Librarian
thinks she's so good,

1337
01:27:52,587 --> 01:27:55,852
why, she even gave her
a raise.
<i>That's wonderful!</i>

1338
01:27:55,924 --> 01:28:00,520
She just wrote me the other
day and she said that...

1339
01:28:00,595 --> 01:28:03,530
Oh, don't wait up for me.
I'm going to be terribly late.

1340
01:28:03,598 --> 01:28:05,532
Good night, sweetie.

1341
01:28:07,435 --> 01:28:09,369
Harry's Club?

1342
01:28:19,981 --> 01:28:22,575
Hope I didn't keep you
waiting too long, Steve.

1343
01:28:22,650 --> 01:28:26,552
Hello?
Is this the Manhattan
Public Library?

1344
01:28:26,621 --> 01:28:30,113
Yes, it is.
May I speak to Miss
Sarah Jane Johnson, please?

1345
01:28:30,191 --> 01:28:32,182
I'm sorry.
The library's closed.

1346
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:34,820
Yes, I know, but she's
on a late shift.

1347
01:28:34,896 --> 01:28:37,262
Reclassifying books
after hours, she said.

1348
01:28:37,332 --> 01:28:39,596
There's no one here
by that name.

1349
01:28:39,667 --> 01:28:42,602
You have no one there
by that name?
No.

1350
01:28:42,670 --> 01:28:45,969
Are you sure?
Absolutely sure?

1351
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,634
Yes, I'm sure.
No one.

1352
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:50,871
I see.

1353
01:28:50,945 --> 01:28:54,005
Well, thank you very much.

1354
01:28:54,082 --> 01:28:56,016
Thank you.

1355
01:29:26,281 --> 01:29:28,215
Can I help you, lady?

1356
01:29:28,283 --> 01:29:31,309
Is there a girl named
Sarah Jane Johnson
working here?

1357
01:29:31,386 --> 01:29:33,911
Never heard of her.
Two?

1358
01:31:14,522 --> 01:31:18,014
<i>I thought you were great</i>
<i>tonight, really great.</i>
Thank you.

1359
01:31:18,092 --> 01:31:20,458
Where do you go
when you run out of here
every night?

1360
01:31:20,528 --> 01:31:22,758
You got a boyfriend?
Could be.

1361
01:31:22,830 --> 01:31:25,765
If you weren't such a cute...
Sarah Jane Johnson!

1362
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:30,770
- You put your clothes on
and get out of this place.
- Say, who is this character?

1363
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:35,940
I don't know.
I've never seen her
before in my life.

1364
01:31:36,010 --> 01:31:40,003
Quit lyin'. You told me
you had a respectable job
in the library.

1365
01:31:40,081 --> 01:31:42,914
Hey, what's going on here?

1366
01:31:42,984 --> 01:31:45,350
Well, she must be crazy.

1367
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:48,412
Tell her
my name's Judy Brand.
Make her go away.

1368
01:31:48,489 --> 01:31:50,650
Look, lady,
why don't you blow?

1369
01:31:50,725 --> 01:31:54,092
You'd better keep out
of this. This girl here
is my daughter.

1370
01:31:54,162 --> 01:31:56,756
And if you don't tell her
to go home with me,
her mother,

1371
01:31:56,831 --> 01:32:00,767
<i>I'll have the law on you.</i>
Your mother?

1372
01:32:00,835 --> 01:32:02,769
Well, I'll be.

1373
01:32:03,905 --> 01:32:07,170
Go on, beat it.

1374
01:32:07,241 --> 01:32:09,175
She's through, anyway.

1375
01:32:25,159 --> 01:32:27,093
Sarah Jane.

1376
01:32:27,161 --> 01:32:29,095
What did you
expect me to do...

1377
01:32:29,163 --> 01:32:32,462
when I find you dancing
in that lowdown dive?

1378
01:32:32,533 --> 01:32:35,627
If it ever got back
to the teachers' college...

1379
01:32:35,703 --> 01:32:40,037
that you were mixed up
in such a place,
they would never let you in.

1380
01:32:40,108 --> 01:32:43,271
I wouldn't be
found dead in a colored
teachers' college.

1381
01:32:43,344 --> 01:32:47,474
Please, come home!

1382
01:32:47,548 --> 01:32:50,176
We'll have some coffee
and we'll talk about this.

1383
01:32:50,251 --> 01:32:53,345
Honey, nobody's all right
about anything,

1384
01:32:53,421 --> 01:32:55,355
and nobody's all wrong.

1385
01:32:55,423 --> 01:32:57,914
If you don't want to
be a teacher, all right.

1386
01:32:57,992 --> 01:33:00,426
We'll talk about
what you want to be.

1387
01:33:00,495 --> 01:33:04,431
Honey, Miss Lora gets home
from Italy in the mornin'
and I'm sure...

1388
01:33:04,499 --> 01:33:06,433
Sarah Jane.

1389
01:33:07,668 --> 01:33:10,102
Sarah Jane!

1390
01:33:10,171 --> 01:33:12,935
Oh. Ooh, dear.

1391
01:33:32,493 --> 01:33:34,427
Oh, Susie, darling!

1392
01:33:36,430 --> 01:33:38,364
All the flowers!

1393
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,534
Oh, it's wonderful.

1394
01:33:43,203 --> 01:33:45,398
I was never so glad
to be home.

1395
01:33:45,472 --> 01:33:47,406
Annie was up
at the crack of dawn.

1396
01:33:47,474 --> 01:33:50,307
Where is she?

1397
01:33:50,377 --> 01:33:53,403
Well, I don't know.
Annie!

1398
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:57,075
Annie!
That's funny. She was
so anxious to see you.

1399
01:33:58,285 --> 01:34:00,219
Annie?

1400
01:34:01,955 --> 01:34:04,583
Annie, what's the matter?

1401
01:34:04,658 --> 01:34:06,592
What happened?

1402
01:34:06,660 --> 01:34:08,594
Is it Sarah Jane?

1403
01:34:10,631 --> 01:34:13,623
"Mama, if you really
want to be kind,

1404
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:16,328
"really a mother,
don't try to find me.

1405
01:34:16,403 --> 01:34:19,930
"Just pretend that I died
or was never born.

1406
01:34:20,007 --> 01:34:23,499
"This is my life and I'm going
to live it my way.

1407
01:34:23,577 --> 01:34:25,340
Sarah Jane."

1408
01:34:26,513 --> 01:34:28,447
Darling, I'm sorry.

1409
01:34:28,515 --> 01:34:30,676
We'll find her
and bring her back.

1410
01:34:30,751 --> 01:34:33,219
No, Miss Lora.

1411
01:34:33,287 --> 01:34:37,280
It's her life and I'm done
with interfering.

1412
01:34:37,357 --> 01:34:40,349
All I'd like to know somehow
is where she is,

1413
01:34:40,427 --> 01:34:43,453
so if she should ever need
anything, I can help her.

1414
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:46,021
Do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

1415
01:34:46,099 --> 01:34:49,398
No, ma'am.
I'll bet Steve will know
what to do. I'll call him.

1416
01:34:49,470 --> 01:34:51,404
All right.

1417
01:34:52,473 --> 01:34:55,067
You lie down for a while.

1418
01:34:55,142 --> 01:34:58,077
We're going to take care
of you for a change.

1419
01:35:03,116 --> 01:35:06,210
Hello, Steve?
Yes.

1420
01:35:06,286 --> 01:35:08,720
Susie.
Let me have it.

1421
01:35:10,190 --> 01:35:13,591
Hello?
No, this isn't Susie.

1422
01:35:13,660 --> 01:35:17,152
That's right.
Oh, a few moments ago.

1423
01:35:17,231 --> 01:35:20,098
Oh, it was wonderful.
Yes.

1424
01:35:20,167 --> 01:35:23,534
And thank you for taking
such good care of my child.

1425
01:35:23,604 --> 01:35:25,538
Yes, she is.

1426
01:35:25,606 --> 01:35:29,736
What's he saying about me?
He thinks you're as cute
as a button, and you are.

1427
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:32,074
Only, Steve,

1428
01:35:32,145 --> 01:35:34,375
something dreadful
has happened.

1429
01:35:35,449 --> 01:35:37,940
When?

1430
01:35:38,018 --> 01:35:40,384
No, I'll put a detective
agency on it...

1431
01:35:40,454 --> 01:35:43,116
and I'll report
the moment I hear anything.

1432
01:35:43,190 --> 01:35:45,124
Good-bye.

1433
01:35:47,694 --> 01:35:51,460
Then under the name
of Linda Carroll,
she got herself a job...

1434
01:35:51,532 --> 01:35:54,228
in the chorus line
at the Moulin Rouge
in Hollywood.

1435
01:35:54,301 --> 01:35:57,395
Where is she living?
At a motel nearby.

1436
01:35:58,505 --> 01:36:01,065
Thanks, Mr. Steve.
I'm going out there.

1437
01:36:01,141 --> 01:36:03,905
No, Annie, you can't.
You're not well enough.

1438
01:36:03,977 --> 01:36:06,036
I'll go get her myself.
No.

1439
01:36:06,113 --> 01:36:08,638
Miss Lora, I have to go.

1440
01:36:08,715 --> 01:36:12,048
I've just got to see
my baby once more.

1441
01:36:12,119 --> 01:36:15,680
All right, Annie.
I'll have my office make
your train reservations.

1442
01:36:15,756 --> 01:36:18,725
Thanks, but I'm not
going by train.

1443
01:36:18,792 --> 01:36:20,953
I'm going to fly.

1444
01:36:21,028 --> 01:36:22,962
I'm in a hurry.

1445
01:38:53,613 --> 01:38:55,547
What's up, honey?

1446
01:38:55,615 --> 01:38:59,210
Oh. I don't know.
Just a funny feeling.

1447
01:38:59,286 --> 01:39:01,948
Don't forget the guys
are picking us up at 12:30.

1448
01:39:02,022 --> 01:39:04,957
I'll rush to the motel
and change. See you there.

1449
01:39:20,073 --> 01:39:22,507
Door's open.

1450
01:39:24,945 --> 01:39:27,243
I'll be ready
in a minute.

1451
01:39:27,314 --> 01:39:29,874
I hope they're not here...

1452
01:39:29,950 --> 01:39:33,579
Now, don't be mad, honey.
Nobody saw me.

1453
01:39:35,288 --> 01:39:37,222
It <i>was</i> you.

1454
01:39:38,825 --> 01:39:41,259
You <i>were</i> there tonight.

1455
01:39:41,328 --> 01:39:43,262
Why can't you leave me alone?

1456
01:39:43,330 --> 01:39:46,527
I tried, Sarah Jane.

1457
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:48,693
You'll never know
how hard I tried.

1458
01:39:48,769 --> 01:39:51,294
Well,

1459
01:39:51,371 --> 01:39:53,305
I might as well pack.

1460
01:39:55,809 --> 01:39:59,370
Look, baby...
I suppose you've been
to the boss,

1461
01:39:59,446 --> 01:40:01,971
lost me my job,
my friends...

1462
01:40:02,048 --> 01:40:04,642
I've been no place.
I didn't come to bother you.

1463
01:40:04,718 --> 01:40:07,050
Well, you won't.
Not ever again.

1464
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:09,782
Spoil things for me here
and I'll go somewhere else.

1465
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:12,723
And I'll keep on going
until you're so tired...

1466
01:40:12,793 --> 01:40:15,387
Baby, I am tired.

1467
01:40:15,462 --> 01:40:18,761
I'm as tired
as I ever want to be.

1468
01:40:18,832 --> 01:40:23,064
You mind if I sit down?
Yes, I do.

1469
01:40:25,138 --> 01:40:28,403
Somebody's coming.
That's why the door
was unlocked.

1470
01:40:28,475 --> 01:40:30,807
I'll only stay a minute.

1471
01:40:30,877 --> 01:40:35,177
I just want to look at you.
That's why I came.

1472
01:40:35,248 --> 01:40:39,184
Are you happy here, honey?
Are you finding what
you really want?

1473
01:40:39,252 --> 01:40:41,982
I'm somebody else.

1474
01:40:42,055 --> 01:40:45,081
I'm white. White!

1475
01:40:46,293 --> 01:40:49,091
White!

1476
01:40:54,134 --> 01:40:56,227
Does that answer you?

1477
01:40:56,303 --> 01:40:58,237
I guess so.

1478
01:40:58,305 --> 01:41:00,830
Then please, Mama,
will you go...

1479
01:41:00,907 --> 01:41:03,034
and never do this again?

1480
01:41:03,109 --> 01:41:06,010
And if by accident,
if we should ever pass
on the street,

1481
01:41:06,079 --> 01:41:08,013
please don't recognize me.

1482
01:41:09,416 --> 01:41:12,783
I won't, Sarah Jane.
I promise.

1483
01:41:12,853 --> 01:41:15,822
I settled all that
in my mind.

1484
01:41:15,889 --> 01:41:18,858
There's just one thing
I wish from you.
What?

1485
01:41:18,925 --> 01:41:21,450
If you're ever in trouble,

1486
01:41:21,528 --> 01:41:24,122
if you ever need
anything at all,

1487
01:41:24,197 --> 01:41:26,188
if you ever want
to come home...

1488
01:41:26,266 --> 01:41:29,167
and you shouldn't be able
to get in touch with me,

1489
01:41:29,236 --> 01:41:32,364
will you let
Miss Lora know?
Yes.

1490
01:41:32,439 --> 01:41:35,033
Yes, anything.
Now will you go?

1491
01:41:35,108 --> 01:41:37,702
That wasn't all I wanted,
honey.

1492
01:41:37,777 --> 01:41:39,972
That was only part of it.

1493
01:41:40,046 --> 01:41:42,037
What's the rest?

1494
01:41:42,115 --> 01:41:44,948
I'd like to hold you
in my arms once more...

1495
01:41:45,018 --> 01:41:46,952
like you were
still my baby.

1496
01:41:48,321 --> 01:41:51,313
All right, Mama.
All right.

1497
01:41:51,391 --> 01:41:53,621
Oh, Sarah Jane.

1498
01:41:53,693 --> 01:41:56,127
Oh, my baby!

1499
01:41:57,530 --> 01:42:00,465
My beautiful,
beautiful baby!

1500
01:42:00,533 --> 01:42:03,058
Oh!

1501
01:42:03,136 --> 01:42:07,539
I love you so much.
Nothin' you ever do
can stop that.

1502
01:42:07,607 --> 01:42:10,098
Oh, Mama!

1503
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:13,612
Oh, my baby.
Mama. Mama.

1504
01:42:14,948 --> 01:42:17,439
Oh, my baby.

1505
01:42:19,519 --> 01:42:23,114
Come on, Linda,
they're waiting.

1506
01:42:25,325 --> 01:42:29,352
Listen, if you're the new maid,
I want to report that my shower
is full of ants.

1507
01:42:29,429 --> 01:42:33,297
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.
That must be very uncomfortable.

1508
01:42:33,366 --> 01:42:37,803
But I just happened to be
in town and dropped in
to see Miss Linda.

1509
01:42:37,871 --> 01:42:40,135
I used to take care of her.

1510
01:42:41,741 --> 01:42:46,007
Well, I guess I'll
be running along.

1511
01:42:46,079 --> 01:42:49,515
My plane's leaving
in a little while,
Miss Linda.

1512
01:42:51,751 --> 01:42:54,720
Good-bye, honey.

1513
01:42:54,788 --> 01:42:58,246
You take good care
of yourself.

1514
01:42:58,325 --> 01:43:00,486
Good-bye.

1515
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:02,494
Mama.

1516
01:43:08,001 --> 01:43:10,697
Well! Get you.

1517
01:43:10,770 --> 01:43:14,604
So, honey child,
you had a mammy.

1518
01:43:14,674 --> 01:43:16,608
Yes.

1519
01:43:17,844 --> 01:43:19,778
All my life.

1520
01:43:29,851 --> 01:43:31,910
Hello, Steve.

1521
01:43:31,987 --> 01:43:33,921
Hello, Lora.

1522
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:38,188
Some of my girlfriends
get embarrassed
when their mothers...

1523
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:40,854
wear shorts or capri pants,
things like that.

1524
01:43:40,929 --> 01:43:43,989
I really don't mind.
That's very big of you.

1525
01:43:44,066 --> 01:43:47,467
I mixed you a highball,
but you only get one
before lunch.

1526
01:43:47,536 --> 01:43:50,198
Yes, ma'am.
I just had a call
from Loomis.

1527
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:53,537
Don't say a word.
He's got a new role for you.
No, no.

1528
01:43:53,608 --> 01:43:55,542
<i>Highball?</i>
Yes.

1529
01:43:55,610 --> 01:43:57,976
No, they've flown over a print
of the Italian picture.

1530
01:43:58,046 --> 01:44:01,880
He's arranged
a special showing tonight,
and a party afterwards.

1531
01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:04,145
Darling, I'd like you
to see it too,

1532
01:44:04,219 --> 01:44:06,551
but I'm worried
about Annie.

1533
01:44:06,621 --> 01:44:09,715
Ever since she came
back from Los Angeles,
she's changed.

1534
01:44:09,791 --> 01:44:13,090
Dr. Miller's quite concerned
about her condition.

1535
01:44:13,161 --> 01:44:17,097
I think someone should stay
in the house with her tonight.
Do you mind?

1536
01:44:17,165 --> 01:44:20,225
No, of course not, Mama.
I'll see you tomorrow, Steve?

1537
01:44:20,302 --> 01:44:22,896
Sure.

1538
01:44:22,971 --> 01:44:25,906
What can we do
to help Annie, Steve?

1539
01:44:25,974 --> 01:44:29,501
There's no answer, Lora,
never has been.

1540
01:44:29,578 --> 01:44:31,512
Not for a broken heart.

1541
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:34,014
Mmm, and I know Mother
didn't understand.

1542
01:44:34,082 --> 01:44:36,448
Oh, it was so embarrassing.
And poor Steve.

1543
01:44:36,518 --> 01:44:40,113
I mean, what could he do?
She just swept over him
like a tidal wave.

1544
01:44:40,188 --> 01:44:44,215
Honey, it's only natural
he'd like to go out
with your mother.

1545
01:44:44,292 --> 01:44:47,955
He always enjoyed her company.
You remember that.

1546
01:44:48,030 --> 01:44:49,998
But it's different now.

1547
01:44:50,065 --> 01:44:52,260
All summer long
it's been Steve and me.

1548
01:44:53,535 --> 01:44:57,130
- Annie, you know, don't you?
- Know what?

1549
01:44:57,205 --> 01:45:02,074
That I'm in love with Steve.
I've always been in love
with him and always will be.

1550
01:45:02,144 --> 01:45:04,806
Sure, Susie,

1551
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:07,212
but like a little girl.

1552
01:45:07,282 --> 01:45:10,513
<i>No. I don't think</i>
<i>it even started like that.</i>

1553
01:45:10,585 --> 01:45:13,816
In a funny way,
I always knew.

1554
01:45:13,889 --> 01:45:17,825
Every time I thought
I liked a boy, it was because
he reminded me of Steve.

1555
01:45:17,893 --> 01:45:21,420
And then I'd stop
liking him because...

1556
01:45:21,496 --> 01:45:23,589
Because he wasn't Steve.

1557
01:46:43,311 --> 01:46:45,939
Susie?
Are you up, darling?

1558
01:46:46,014 --> 01:46:48,073
<i>Yes.</i>

1559
01:46:48,150 --> 01:46:51,677
I just had to tell you.
I have the most wonderful news.

1560
01:46:51,753 --> 01:46:54,620
You're going to do
another picture.
No.

1561
01:46:54,689 --> 01:46:58,853
Not a picture,
not a play,
never again.

1562
01:46:58,927 --> 01:47:02,954
Oh, I know you
don't believe me.
I can't blame you.

1563
01:47:03,031 --> 01:47:06,660
Steve didn't either.
He probably won't until
our tenth anniversary.

1564
01:47:08,236 --> 01:47:10,170
A-Anniversary?

1565
01:47:10,238 --> 01:47:13,639
Oh, Steve and I have
always been in love.

1566
01:47:13,708 --> 01:47:18,111
But it seems I've never
had time for anything
but my work.

1567
01:47:18,180 --> 01:47:22,207
So I just up and proposed
that we get married.

1568
01:47:24,019 --> 01:47:27,580
<i>Well, Susie,</i>
<i>what's the matter?</i>
<i>Are you all right?</i>

1569
01:47:27,656 --> 01:47:31,319
Yes, I'm fine.
I hope you'll be very happy.

1570
01:47:31,393 --> 01:47:34,226
Oh, we will be,
all of us.

1571
01:47:36,231 --> 01:47:38,893
What is it, darling?
Tell me.

1572
01:47:38,967 --> 01:47:41,401
I'm very tired.
Good night, Mother.

1573
01:47:43,972 --> 01:47:45,906
Good night, dear.

1574
01:48:04,626 --> 01:48:09,029
You know, Annie,
last night when I told
Susie the news,

1575
01:48:10,532 --> 01:48:12,864
she was like ice.

1576
01:48:12,934 --> 01:48:16,802
It's strange.
I... I thought she
would be ecstatic.

1577
01:48:19,307 --> 01:48:22,868
She always seemed to...
To adore Steve.

1578
01:48:26,514 --> 01:48:29,915
Something's wrong
with her, Annie.

1579
01:48:29,985 --> 01:48:31,919
Do you know what it is?

1580
01:48:33,755 --> 01:48:39,057
Miss Lora, you've got
to be very careful
the way you handle Susie.

1581
01:48:39,127 --> 01:48:42,062
She's got
a real problem.
Problem?

1582
01:48:42,130 --> 01:48:45,566
Why don't I know about it?
Why didn't she come to me?

1583
01:48:45,634 --> 01:48:48,228
Maybe because
you weren't around.

1584
01:48:49,571 --> 01:48:52,267
You mean, I...

1585
01:48:52,340 --> 01:48:54,274
I haven't been
a good mother.

1586
01:48:54,342 --> 01:48:57,243
I know you meant
to be a good mother,

1587
01:48:57,312 --> 01:48:59,542
the best kind of mother,

1588
01:48:59,614 --> 01:49:04,347
but look, I meant to
be a good one too,
and I failed.

1589
01:49:04,419 --> 01:49:07,786
But you couldn't have been
a better mother to Sarah Jane.

1590
01:49:07,856 --> 01:49:12,122
- Then where's
my little girl?
- But Annie, that's different.

1591
01:49:12,193 --> 01:49:14,525
Hers is
a very real problem.

1592
01:49:14,596 --> 01:49:16,621
What's complicated
Susie's life?

1593
01:49:16,698 --> 01:49:20,031
We made a home for her;
the prettiest clothes;
the best schools.

1594
01:49:20,101 --> 01:49:24,128
- Susie's in love.
- Oh, Annie.

1595
01:49:24,205 --> 01:49:27,140
Is that all?
Why didn't you say so?

1596
01:49:27,208 --> 01:49:30,336
<i>It's not unusual for a girl</i>
<i>Susie's age to be in love.</i>

1597
01:49:30,412 --> 01:49:33,904
It's who she's in love with
that's causing all the trouble.

1598
01:49:33,982 --> 01:49:37,611
Why? Who is it?

1599
01:49:38,687 --> 01:49:40,621
Mr. Steve.

1600
01:49:42,657 --> 01:49:45,148
What?

1601
01:49:45,226 --> 01:49:47,660
That's impossible.

1602
01:49:47,729 --> 01:49:50,493
How did it happen?
Why did he let it happen?

1603
01:49:50,565 --> 01:49:52,829
I don't think he knows.

1604
01:49:52,901 --> 01:49:55,301
Annie, it can't
be serious!

1605
01:49:55,370 --> 01:49:58,396
It is, Miss Lora.
Plenty serious.

1606
01:49:58,473 --> 01:50:01,408
I better have a talk
with Susie right now.

1607
01:50:01,476 --> 01:50:03,569
Wait, wait.

1608
01:50:06,815 --> 01:50:08,942
Susie.

1609
01:50:09,017 --> 01:50:11,144
I've just spoken
to Annie.
Have you?

1610
01:50:11,219 --> 01:50:14,552
Now I know why you were
so upset last night.
So Annie told you.

1611
01:50:14,622 --> 01:50:18,114
That's how you usually
find things out about me.
That's not true!

1612
01:50:18,193 --> 01:50:21,060
Let's face it, Mama.
Annie's always been more
like a real mother.

1613
01:50:21,129 --> 01:50:24,587
You never had time for me.
By the way, is this
worded correctly?

1614
01:50:27,902 --> 01:50:30,564
An application
to college?
Uh-huh.

1615
01:50:30,638 --> 01:50:33,129
But you're going
to study in New York.

1616
01:50:33,208 --> 01:50:35,506
Denver...
It's 1,500 miles away.

1617
01:50:35,577 --> 01:50:37,738
1,628, to be exact.
That's quite a distance.

1618
01:50:37,812 --> 01:50:41,009
I don't think
I'll be missed.
Don't be unfair, Susie.

1619
01:50:41,082 --> 01:50:43,915
You know I'd miss you.
I'm sure you'd be too busy
to miss anyone.

1620
01:50:43,985 --> 01:50:45,976
Much too busy.

1621
01:50:46,054 --> 01:50:48,318
You give me credit
for nothing.

1622
01:50:48,390 --> 01:50:51,188
Yes, I'm ambitious,
perhaps too ambitious,

1623
01:50:51,259 --> 01:50:53,750
but it's been for your sake
as well as mine.

1624
01:50:53,828 --> 01:50:56,763
Isn't this house
just a little bit nicer
than a cold-water flat?

1625
01:50:56,831 --> 01:50:59,265
And your new horse.
Aren't you crazy about it?
Yes, but I...

1626
01:50:59,334 --> 01:51:02,531
And that closet of yours...
Has all the dresses fit for
the daughter of a famous star.

1627
01:51:02,604 --> 01:51:04,538
Now, just a moment,
young lady.

1628
01:51:04,606 --> 01:51:07,871
It's only because
of my ambition that you've
had the best of everything.

1629
01:51:07,942 --> 01:51:11,173
That's a solid achievement
that any mother can be proud of.

1630
01:51:11,246 --> 01:51:13,180
How about a mother's love?

1631
01:51:13,248 --> 01:51:16,445
Love? But you've
always had that!

1632
01:51:16,518 --> 01:51:19,214
Yes, by telephone, postcard,
magazine interviews.

1633
01:51:19,287 --> 01:51:22,450
You've given me everything
but yourself.

1634
01:51:22,524 --> 01:51:27,188
No wonder I went to Annie
last night when I told her
about Steve.

1635
01:51:27,262 --> 01:51:29,196
Oh, Susie.

1636
01:51:32,367 --> 01:51:34,801
If Steve is going
to come between us,

1637
01:51:37,105 --> 01:51:39,300
I'll give him up.

1638
01:51:39,374 --> 01:51:41,535
I'll never see him again.

1639
01:51:41,609 --> 01:51:44,305
Oh, Mama, stop acting!

1640
01:51:44,379 --> 01:51:47,746
Stop trying to shift people
around as if they were pawns
on a stage.

1641
01:51:47,816 --> 01:51:50,250
But, Susie, I...
Don't worry,
I'll get over Steve,

1642
01:51:50,318 --> 01:51:52,752
but please,
don't play the martyr.

1643
01:51:57,425 --> 01:52:01,862
Oh, Mama, I'm sorry.
I didn't want to hurt you.

1644
01:52:01,930 --> 01:52:05,764
But last night
I was so unhappy!

1645
01:52:07,335 --> 01:52:09,269
Oh, darling.

1646
01:52:10,905 --> 01:52:13,738
I... I don't know.

1647
01:52:13,808 --> 01:52:16,436
Maybe it was all
to the good because...

1648
01:52:16,511 --> 01:52:20,447
this morning I felt
strangely independent and...

1649
01:52:20,515 --> 01:52:22,949
Well, I like the feeling.

1650
01:52:23,017 --> 01:52:26,009
That's why I think I'd...
I'd like to go away,

1651
01:52:26,087 --> 01:52:28,146
at least for a while.

1652
01:52:28,223 --> 01:52:30,885
Oh, Mama, please try
to understand.

1653
01:52:30,959 --> 01:52:32,893
I'm very sincere
about it.

1654
01:52:36,698 --> 01:52:39,633
Ah, it's funny
the way things turn out.

1655
01:52:44,705 --> 01:52:46,639
Thank you.

1656
01:52:53,147 --> 01:52:56,082
I still can't get over Susie
at the station yesterday.

1657
01:52:56,150 --> 01:52:59,779
She looked so... grown-up
when she said good-bye.

1658
01:52:59,853 --> 01:53:01,787
Yes, she did.

1659
01:53:05,159 --> 01:53:08,595
It does seem awfully
quiet here without her.

1660
01:53:08,662 --> 01:53:11,028
Annie and I were talking
about that last night.

1661
01:53:11,098 --> 01:53:15,501
With both the girls gone,
we felt so alone
in this big house.

1662
01:53:15,569 --> 01:53:18,197
When did this idea
of college come up?

1663
01:53:18,272 --> 01:53:20,706
Susie never once
mentioned it to me.

1664
01:53:20,774 --> 01:53:23,766
She decided suddenly.

1665
01:53:23,844 --> 01:53:26,870
And why Colorado?
So far away.

1666
01:53:26,947 --> 01:53:29,609
It's what she wanted.

1667
01:53:29,683 --> 01:53:32,618
Miss Meredith, it's Annie.
She's terribly sick.

1668
01:53:32,686 --> 01:53:35,280
Did you call
the doctor?
Yes, he'll
be right over.

1669
01:53:35,355 --> 01:53:37,550
And she wants
the minister too.

1670
01:53:56,877 --> 01:53:59,072
Oh, God, no!

1671
01:54:01,415 --> 01:54:03,645
I hate to dispute you,
Miss Lora.

1672
01:54:06,754 --> 01:54:08,688
Oh, Annie, don't talk.

1673
01:54:08,756 --> 01:54:11,418
<i>I've got to talk.</i>
<i>I've got to.</i>
Oh, please.

1674
01:54:11,492 --> 01:54:13,426
Please, not now.

1675
01:54:13,494 --> 01:54:15,428
You stop crying.
But I...

1676
01:54:15,496 --> 01:54:19,262
No, listen to me.
All right.
I'm listening.

1677
01:54:19,333 --> 01:54:22,393
When my bills
are all paid,

1678
01:54:22,469 --> 01:54:25,836
I want everything
that's left to go to...

1679
01:54:25,906 --> 01:54:28,431
Sarah Jane.
Of course.

1680
01:54:28,509 --> 01:54:32,445
Mr. Steve?
<i>Yes, Annie?</i>

1681
01:54:32,513 --> 01:54:36,142
Find her, Mr. Steve.
Find her.

1682
01:54:36,216 --> 01:54:38,878
I will.
You may be sure.

1683
01:54:38,952 --> 01:54:41,682
<i>I will.</i>
Thank you.

1684
01:54:41,755 --> 01:54:44,656
Miss Lora,
just tell her...

1685
01:54:44,725 --> 01:54:48,126
Tell her I know
I was selfish,

1686
01:54:48,195 --> 01:54:51,892
and if I loved her too much,
I'm sorry.

1687
01:54:53,200 --> 01:54:55,896
But I didn't mean
to cause her any trouble.

1688
01:54:55,969 --> 01:54:57,903
She was all I had.

1689
01:54:57,971 --> 01:55:00,633
<i>Tell her, Miss Lora.</i>
Oh, please, Annie!

1690
01:55:00,707 --> 01:55:04,143
Promise me?
Promise me?
I promise.

1691
01:55:04,211 --> 01:55:06,577
Ohh.

1692
01:55:06,647 --> 01:55:09,480
<i>My pearl necklace.</i>
Yes?

1693
01:55:10,818 --> 01:55:13,719
I want you to give it
to Susie...

1694
01:55:13,787 --> 01:55:15,721
for her weddin'.

1695
01:55:17,024 --> 01:55:19,993
Give her a real
bridey wedding...

1696
01:55:20,060 --> 01:55:21,994
with all the fixin's.

1697
01:55:23,330 --> 01:55:26,424
Our weddin' day...

1698
01:55:26,500 --> 01:55:30,266
and the day we die...

1699
01:55:30,337 --> 01:55:32,271
are the great events...

1700
01:55:33,574 --> 01:55:35,667
of life.

1701
01:55:36,777 --> 01:55:38,711
Oh, Annie!

1702
01:55:38,779 --> 01:55:40,906
Annie, darling.

1703
01:55:40,981 --> 01:55:44,246
There's no cause to cry.

1704
01:55:44,318 --> 01:55:46,218
- Reverend?
- Yes, Annie?

1705
01:55:49,790 --> 01:55:54,386
I'd like for your wife
to have my fur scarf.

1706
01:55:54,461 --> 01:55:58,124
She always admired
that fur.

1707
01:55:58,198 --> 01:56:02,931
She never believed me when
I said it was genuine mink.

1708
01:56:03,003 --> 01:56:05,733
She did, Annie,
she did.

1709
01:56:05,806 --> 01:56:08,172
Oh, please,
you don't have to...

1710
01:56:08,242 --> 01:56:10,437
And I want Mr. McKinney...

1711
01:56:10,510 --> 01:56:14,344
to have a nice, clean
50-dollar bill.

1712
01:56:14,414 --> 01:56:16,712
M-Mr. McKinney?

1713
01:56:16,783 --> 01:56:20,844
The milkman at the old
cold-water flat.
Oh.

1714
01:56:20,921 --> 01:56:25,017
He was so nice
and understanding
about the bill.

1715
01:56:25,092 --> 01:56:28,118
I always send him
a little something
at Christmas time,

1716
01:56:28,195 --> 01:56:30,129
in both our names.

1717
01:56:32,165 --> 01:56:34,633
You've been so good.

1718
01:56:34,701 --> 01:56:37,898
Sure hope you're right,
Miss Lora.

1719
01:56:37,971 --> 01:56:40,963
I'd like to be standin'
with the lambs...

1720
01:56:41,041 --> 01:56:43,032
and not with the goats...

1721
01:56:43,110 --> 01:56:44,975
on judgment day.

1722
01:56:46,580 --> 01:56:49,413
And my funeral...

1723
01:56:49,483 --> 01:56:52,179
Mr. Steve,

1724
01:56:52,252 --> 01:56:56,712
you'll find what I want
in the drawer...

1725
01:56:56,790 --> 01:56:58,724
over there.

1726
01:57:04,398 --> 01:57:06,332
I've got it, Annie.

1727
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:09,062
I want to go...

1728
01:57:09,136 --> 01:57:11,969
the way I planned,

1729
01:57:12,039 --> 01:57:15,600
especially
the four white horses...

1730
01:57:15,676 --> 01:57:18,611
and a band playin'.

1731
01:57:18,679 --> 01:57:20,977
No mourning,

1732
01:57:21,048 --> 01:57:24,950
but proud
and high-steppin',

1733
01:57:26,086 --> 01:57:28,316
like I was goin'
to glory.

1734
01:57:28,388 --> 01:57:31,221
No. I won't listen.

1735
01:57:31,291 --> 01:57:34,783
There isn't going
to be any funeral,
not for a long, long time.

1736
01:57:34,861 --> 01:57:37,830
You can't leave me.
I won't let you.

1737
01:57:39,333 --> 01:57:41,801
I'm just tired, Miss Lora.

1738
01:57:43,870 --> 01:57:47,567
Awfully... tired.

1739
01:57:51,812 --> 01:57:53,905
Annie!

1740
01:57:53,981 --> 01:57:56,916
Annie!

1741
01:57:56,984 --> 01:57:58,918
No!

1742
02:00:19,388 --> 02:00:23,722
<i>"I will lift up mine eyes</i>
<i>unto the hills from whence</i>
<i>cometh my help.</i>

1743
02:00:23,792 --> 02:00:27,990
"My help cometh from the Lord
which made heaven and earth.

1744
02:00:28,063 --> 02:00:30,964
"He will not suffer thy foot
to be moved.

1745
02:00:31,033 --> 02:00:34,332
"He that keepeth thee

1746
02:00:34,403 --> 02:00:38,806
<i>"Behold, he that keepeth Israel</i>

1747
02:00:38,874 --> 02:00:41,843

1748
02:00:41,910 --> 02:00:44,902
<i>"The Lord is the shade</i>

1749
02:00:44,980 --> 02:00:48,211
<i>"The sun shall not</i>

1750
02:00:48,283 --> 02:00:50,251

<i>The Lord shall preserve</i>

1754
02:01:00,696 --> 02:01:03,494
Let me through!
Please!

1755
02:01:03,565 --> 02:01:05,499
Please, let me through!

1756
02:01:10,105 --> 02:01:12,039
Hey, stand back, miss.

1757
02:01:12,107 --> 02:01:14,371
But it's my mother!
Stand back.

1758
02:01:14,443 --> 02:01:18,539
I'm telling you,
it's my mother!

1759
02:01:18,613 --> 02:01:21,377
Please.

1760
02:01:22,617 --> 02:01:25,142
Mama!

1761
02:01:25,220 --> 02:01:28,485
<i>Mama!</i>

1762
02:01:30,792 --> 02:01:32,885
I didn't mean it.

1763
02:01:32,961 --> 02:01:34,929
I didn't mean it.

1764
02:01:34,997 --> 02:01:38,728
Mama, do you hear me?

1765
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:41,667
I'm sorry.

1766
02:01:41,737 --> 02:01:44,797
I'm sorry, Mama.

1767
02:01:44,873 --> 02:01:47,933
Mama, I did love you.

1768
02:01:49,511 --> 02:01:52,605
Sarah Jane.
Sarah Jane, don't!

1769
02:01:54,549 --> 02:01:56,483
Miss Lora.

1770
02:01:58,086 --> 02:02:00,680
Miss Lora,
I killed my mother.

1771
02:02:00,756 --> 02:02:02,690
I killed her.

1772
02:02:02,758 --> 02:02:05,522
I wanted to come home.
Shh.

1773
02:02:05,594 --> 02:02:09,360
Now she'll never know how much
I wanted to come home.
Come with us.
