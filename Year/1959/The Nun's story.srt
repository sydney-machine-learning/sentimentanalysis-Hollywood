1
00:02:52,017 --> 00:02:55,418
"He that shall lose his life for me
shall find it.

2
00:02:56,722 --> 00:02:58,713
"If thou wilt be perfect...

3
00:02:59,058 --> 00:03:02,892
"go sell what thou hast
and give to the poor...

4
00:03:02,962 --> 00:03:04,953
"and come follow me. "

5
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:12,281
Each sister shall understand
that on entering the convent...

6
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,857
she has made the sacrifice
of her life to God.

7
00:04:49,398 --> 00:04:51,833
Well, are we off?

8
00:04:52,135 --> 00:04:56,003
-Whenever you're ready, Father.
-Let's not wait for that.

9
00:04:58,641 --> 00:05:00,506
Your hat's on crooked.

10
00:05:01,244 --> 00:05:04,611
I tried to put it on without a mirror
to get used to....

11
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,079
There.

12
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:18,505
Marie didn't want to say goodbye.
And I'd rather not see Louise.

13
00:05:18,847 --> 00:05:20,872
She'll be so upset and....

14
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,111
There's no chance. I'll wait outside.

15
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:35,253
Now, Louise, I left some things upstairs
for you and Marie.

16
00:05:35,897 --> 00:05:40,410
Divide the dresses, but you keep
the blue ones because blue is your color.

17
00:06:02,962 --> 00:06:04,725
Take good care of Father.

18
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,323
And don't let him
do too many operations in one day.

19
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,992
Why do you have to go, anyway?

20
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,262
Pierre.

21
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,597
Come along, Gaby,
I ordered the table for 1 :00.

22
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:19,142
I wish you all as happy as I am.

23
00:06:48,861 --> 00:06:51,796
Gaby, I can see you poor,
I can see you chaste.

24
00:06:51,864 --> 00:06:56,013
But I cannot see you, a strong-willed girl,
obedient to those bells.

25
00:06:57,521 --> 00:07:00,615
In the Congo, Father,
they'll be calling me to work I love.

26
00:07:00,691 --> 00:07:04,149
You may never get to the Congo.
You certainly can never ask for it.

27
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:05,957
You know that, don't you?

28
00:07:06,364 --> 00:07:09,731
Your personal wishes cease to exist
when you enter that door.

29
00:07:12,236 --> 00:07:15,535
Maybe it would be easier
if I went in alone, Father.

30
00:07:16,307 --> 00:07:20,126
You're not an orphan.
Or going without your father's consent.

31
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,357
Please remember this, Gaby.

32
00:07:22,432 --> 00:07:25,526
Remember, if you ever decide
this is not right for you...

33
00:07:25,602 --> 00:07:29,231
there is no sense of failure
in coming back home.

34
00:08:02,325 --> 00:08:03,849
Sister William.

35
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:18,783
-Dr. Van der Mal?
-Yes?

36
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:22,388
My name's Pascin.
You operated on me five years ago.

37
00:08:22,464 --> 00:08:25,627
-Oh, yes. Left lung, wasn't it?
-No, the right.

38
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:31,269
-May I present my daughter, Simone?
-And my daughter, Gabrielle.

39
00:08:36,631 --> 00:08:38,223
A great day.

40
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:45,066
-Dr. Van der Mal?
-Sister.

41
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:48,131
I am Sister Margarita,
Mistress of Postulants.

42
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,338
Welcome.

43
00:08:52,613 --> 00:08:55,173
Of course you know Sister William
from the hospital.

44
00:08:55,249 --> 00:08:58,704
Sister William and I
have shared many an anxious hour.

45
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:05,171
Sister William says Gabrielle
will be a truly great nurse.

46
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:08,044
I know you are largely responsible for that.

47
00:09:08,116 --> 00:09:12,280
-I'll miss her in my laboratory.
-We'll put her to good use in ours.

48
00:09:13,488 --> 00:09:15,319
Real spirit, I think.

49
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:20,126
Well, we call it stubbornness.
You may, too, after a few weeks.

50
00:09:20,595 --> 00:09:22,582
We'll be going in shortly.

51
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:25,447
-Good afternoon, Doctor.
-Good afternoon, Sister.

52
00:09:28,655 --> 00:09:32,182
I suppose Sister Margarita
is what they call a living rule.

53
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:33,658
What's that?

54
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,054
They say if the holy rule of a convent
were destroyed...

55
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,396
it could be recaptured by studying
the behavior of such a perfect nun.

56
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:46,262
-Doctor.
-Sister.

57
00:09:48,527 --> 00:09:50,495
The dowry, I think, Father.

58
00:09:51,096 --> 00:09:53,496
Oh, yes, of course.

59
00:09:55,134 --> 00:09:56,795
Thank you, Doctor.

60
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:28,349
Goodbye, Father. I'll miss you.

61
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:32,414
I'll do my best.

62
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:35,149
I want you to be proud of me.

63
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:38,940
I don't want to be proud of you.
I want you to be happy.

64
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:41,014
I am happy.

65
00:11:57,018 --> 00:12:00,715
Gabrielle, your number is 1,072.

66
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:02,721
Thank you, Sister.

67
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,521
You are blessed to have this number.

68
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:09,360
It belonged to Sister Marie Polycarpe.
She was a nursing sister in the Congo.

69
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:19,649
When you have your things, you will
form two columns and face the door.

70
00:12:23,698 --> 00:12:25,495
From now on, your place in line...

71
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:28,535
is determined by your age
in this community.

72
00:12:29,637 --> 00:12:32,037
The first admitted is the oldest.

73
00:12:32,106 --> 00:12:34,199
That is Yvonne Duval.

74
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:35,667
Here.

75
00:12:39,013 --> 00:12:42,365
Yvonne Duval. Henrietta de la Croix.

76
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:46,699
Simone Pascin. Cecile de Planer.

77
00:12:47,507 --> 00:12:49,372
Gabrielle Van der Mal.

78
00:12:49,809 --> 00:12:51,333
Helen de Rode.

79
00:12:52,412 --> 00:12:55,848
Your hands must learn to stay still.
And out of sight.

80
00:12:56,116 --> 00:12:59,415
Except when they're needed
for nursing or prayer.

81
00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:03,254
I'm so glad you're here, Sister William.

82
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,725
When you go through that door,
I'm not here.

83
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,076
For the six months
that you're a postulant...

84
00:13:09,148 --> 00:13:10,740
and the year as a novice...

85
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:13,980
we may not speak to each other
except in matters of work.

86
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:15,811
I didn't know.

87
00:13:19,893 --> 00:13:21,861
Do not fret about your veils.

88
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:24,822
You will soon learn to dress
without mirrors.

89
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:29,429
As you will learn tomorrow
when we start studying the Holy Rule...

90
00:13:29,502 --> 00:13:32,041
which governs our life
here in the community...

91
00:13:32,491 --> 00:13:35,619
one of the first conditions
is the rule of silence.

92
00:13:36,628 --> 00:13:39,495
Exterior and interior silence.

93
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:44,393
We observe the Grand Silence
from after chapel at night...

94
00:13:44,636 --> 00:13:46,763
until after chapel in the morning.

95
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:52,602
We will go now into chapel
for evening prayers.

96
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:19,255
Dear children, you will have five days
of instruction and preparation...

97
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:23,791
before you are formally admitted
as postulants by the Superior General.

98
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:28,794
We constantly strive toward perfection
by inner silence.

99
00:17:29,868 --> 00:17:31,733
The ultimate goal of this silence...

100
00:17:31,803 --> 00:17:35,364
is to make possible
constant conversation with God.

101
00:17:36,074 --> 00:17:38,235
Therefore, we do not talk loudly...

102
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:41,479
nor do we engage
in useless conversations.

103
00:17:42,566 --> 00:17:44,796
We close doors quietly.

104
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:49,728
Whenever possible,
we use a kind of sign language.

105
00:17:52,209 --> 00:17:55,144
This means,
"May I have permission to speak?"

106
00:17:56,346 --> 00:17:58,644
This means, "Excuse me."

107
00:18:00,017 --> 00:18:01,609
Shall we try it?

108
00:18:09,645 --> 00:18:12,705
We do this to attract a sister's attention.

109
00:18:14,183 --> 00:18:15,707
Just the sleeve.

110
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:18,883
We never touch another sister, of course.

111
00:18:19,622 --> 00:18:22,648
We use signs, particularly during meals.

112
00:18:23,726 --> 00:18:26,559
We, of course,
never ask for things for ourselves.

113
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:30,356
Each sister is alert to the needs
of her fellow sisters.

114
00:18:51,573 --> 00:18:54,133
In walking, dear children,
we never saunter...

115
00:18:54,209 --> 00:18:57,493
as though we had no place to go.
Nor do we hurry.

116
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:01,467
When we walk
through halls and corridors...

117
00:19:01,535 --> 00:19:05,164
we practice humility
by walking close to the walls.

118
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:06,564
Now.

119
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,591
Tomorrow, in the chapter hall...

120
00:19:57,662 --> 00:20:01,792
the Superior General will admit you
formally into the congregation.

121
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:05,358
And you will begin
your six months?terms as postulants.

122
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:10,633
The Reverend Mother Emmanuel
represents Christ among us.

123
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:13,827
And as such she is loved
and obeyed by us.

124
00:21:10,426 --> 00:21:12,690
What do you ask, my children?

125
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:17,032
To be admitted into this congregation.

126
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:19,599
Arise in the name of God.

127
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:32,098
Dear children, it is not easy to be a nun.

128
00:21:32,735 --> 00:21:35,636
It is not a life of refuge from the world.

129
00:21:35,739 --> 00:21:37,798
It is a life of sacrifice.

130
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:41,435
In a way, it is a life against nature.

131
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:46,046
It is a never-ending struggle
for self-perfection.

132
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:49,616
Some of you will have
more trouble than others.

133
00:21:50,286 --> 00:21:54,036
Poverty, chastity, and obedience
are extremely difficult.

134
00:21:54,343 --> 00:21:56,868
Each of us here can assure you of that.

135
00:21:57,613 --> 00:22:01,515
The sacrifices that are required
of us are bearable...

136
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:04,051
only if we make them with love.

137
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,217
Just as in the world
we can do impossible things...

138
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:10,815
with a glad heart for a loved one...

139
00:22:11,093 --> 00:22:12,890
so it is with us.

140
00:22:13,562 --> 00:22:15,996
We can endure greater sacrifice...

141
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:21,213
because the object of our love
is our Lord Jesus Christ.

142
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:25,288
In order to come into closer union
with our Lord...

143
00:22:25,893 --> 00:22:28,794
you will be submitted
to exercises and tests...

144
00:22:29,497 --> 00:22:32,057
which are designed
to root out your faults...

145
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,195
curb your passions...

146
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:37,666
and prepare you
for acquiring the virtues and grace.

147
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,132
If you question
these exercises in humility...

148
00:22:41,411 --> 00:22:45,262
these steps towards a closer union
with our crucified Lord...

149
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:48,197
you do not belong with us.

150
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:52,898
Cloistered life is made up
of an infinity of small things.

151
00:22:53,507 --> 00:22:56,772
You must try to live the Holy Rule
not day by day...

152
00:22:57,077 --> 00:22:58,772
but minute by minute...

153
00:22:58,845 --> 00:23:02,372
in a state of constant alertness
against imperfections.

154
00:23:03,016 --> 00:23:06,350
The perfect nun is one who,
for the love of God...

155
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:09,472
is obedient in all things unto death.

156
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:14,742
Remember, dear children,
you can very easily cheat us, your sisters.

157
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:18,912
But you can never cheat yourself. Or God.

158
00:23:33,685 --> 00:23:37,416
The postulant will learn
strict obedience to the bell...

159
00:23:37,488 --> 00:23:39,251
which is the voice of God.

160
00:23:39,591 --> 00:23:42,287
Stopping whatever she is doing instantly...

161
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,420
when it calls to other duty or devotions.

162
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:50,494
What is served for lunch, do you know?

163
00:23:51,936 --> 00:23:55,235
It doesn't matter.
They won't let me eat it, anyway.

164
00:24:26,977 --> 00:24:29,605
Twice each day for the rest of your lives...

165
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,807
you will examine your consciences.

166
00:24:31,915 --> 00:24:33,746
And enter in these notebooks...

167
00:24:33,817 --> 00:24:37,014
each and every imperfection
against the Holy Rule.

168
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:42,190
For example, if you drink
a glass of water between meals...

169
00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:44,284
without asking permission.

170
00:24:44,494 --> 00:24:47,031
If you leave a light on unnecessarily.

171
00:24:47,683 --> 00:24:51,050
If you're late for work, and so on.

172
00:24:52,355 --> 00:24:56,052
I accuse myself of breaking
the Grand Silence.

173
00:24:56,792 --> 00:25:01,559
I accuse myself of
uncharitable thoughts about my sisters.

174
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:07,034
I accuse myself of having drunk a glass of
water between meals without permission.

175
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:10,801
I accuse myself of failing
in modesty of the eyes.

176
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:14,122
I accuse myself of worldly desires.

177
00:25:14,963 --> 00:25:18,126
I accuse myself
of having spoken without necessity.

178
00:25:19,501 --> 00:25:22,629
I accuse myself of laughing
during the Grand Silence.

179
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,768
I accuse myself....

180
00:25:29,244 --> 00:25:31,712
I accuse myself of daydreaming.

181
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,344
-I accuse myself....
-I accuse myself....

182
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,250
Enter.

183
00:26:23,971 --> 00:26:27,721
Yesterday I visited one of our sisters
who is ill in hospital.

184
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:30,091
And your father was attending her.

185
00:26:31,063 --> 00:26:34,260
He asked about you. And about the Congo.

186
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:38,167
And the bush station where he thinks
you would like to do your nursing.

187
00:26:38,237 --> 00:26:42,071
I told him it was much too soon
even to think of it.

188
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:44,204
Of course, Reverend Mother.

189
00:26:45,111 --> 00:26:47,978
-I....
-Well, go ahead.

190
00:26:49,982 --> 00:26:52,399
I just want to become a good nurse
and a good nun...

191
00:26:52,469 --> 00:26:54,438
and to do God's work wherever I'm sent.

192
00:26:54,506 --> 00:26:56,474
First become a good nun.

193
00:26:56,942 --> 00:27:00,378
We select only the very strongest sisters
for our missions.

194
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,913
Your nursing qualifications would
seem to make you a likely candidate.

195
00:27:05,283 --> 00:27:09,219
But you are still very far
from being mature in the religious life.

196
00:27:09,821 --> 00:27:13,222
Maturity is the armor of our missionaries.

197
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:16,762
And this is not achieved in a day.

198
00:27:18,315 --> 00:27:20,783
Since tomorrow is the day of vesture...

199
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:23,479
when you receive the habit of a novice...

200
00:27:23,554 --> 00:27:26,079
we must talk today about detachment.

201
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:31,221
You have already detached yourselves
from family and friends.

202
00:27:32,196 --> 00:27:36,758
Now we have the difficult detachment
from things and memories.

203
00:27:38,135 --> 00:27:40,399
Tonight, when you go to your cells...

204
00:27:40,571 --> 00:27:43,081
you will find parts of your new habit.

205
00:27:43,793 --> 00:27:48,093
And on your tables, the only possessions
allowed you from now on.

206
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:51,790
A basket will be passed.

207
00:27:52,635 --> 00:27:55,763
And you must put in it,
of your own free will...

208
00:27:56,472 --> 00:27:58,497
any object you still have...

209
00:27:59,075 --> 00:28:02,306
which might call up memories
of your former life.

210
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:56,561
What do you ask, my daughters?

211
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:00,424
We ask for the mercy of God.

212
00:29:00,795 --> 00:29:03,559
And for the favor to be received...

213
00:29:03,631 --> 00:29:05,758
into this congregation.

214
00:29:06,134 --> 00:29:08,159
We offer our Lord...

215
00:29:08,236 --> 00:29:11,933
our liberty, our memory, and our will.

216
00:29:12,073 --> 00:29:16,703
And we ask only for His love
and His holy grace.

217
00:29:17,645 --> 00:29:19,636
Are you firmly resolved...

218
00:29:20,114 --> 00:29:23,466
to despise the honors, riches...

219
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,205
and all the vain pleasures of this world...

220
00:29:27,674 --> 00:29:30,768
in order to prepare
for a closer union with God?

221
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,970
We are so resolved, Monsignor.

222
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,781
Do you make this request
of your own free will?

223
00:29:38,852 --> 00:29:40,183
-Yes.
-Yes.

224
00:29:44,758 --> 00:29:47,293
May the Lord, who has begun this...

225
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:51,313
-bring it to perfection.
-Amen.

226
00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:37,688
Go, my children...

227
00:31:37,767 --> 00:31:40,793
divest yourselves
of the vanity of this world.

228
00:31:41,337 --> 00:31:45,000
And receive for your bodies
the habit of humility.

229
00:35:12,952 --> 00:35:17,449
Yvonne Duval
will be known as Sister Marie Sebastian.

230
00:35:18,193 --> 00:35:22,789
Henrietta de la Croix
will be known as Sister Marie Bernadette.

231
00:35:26,768 --> 00:35:31,432
Simone Pascin
will be known as Sister Marie Christine.

232
00:35:32,574 --> 00:35:37,016
Cecile de Planer
will be known as Sister Marie Joseph.

233
00:35:42,103 --> 00:35:46,096
Gabrielle Van der Mal
will be known as Sister Luke.

234
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:14,413
Sister, you make a beautiful nun.

235
00:36:20,994 --> 00:36:22,188
Sister.

236
00:36:42,635 --> 00:36:44,227
You're blushing.

237
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:47,128
It happened to me, too, in my ward.

238
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,908
We shouldn't blush, I'm sure we shouldn't.

239
00:36:49,976 --> 00:36:51,741
How can we help it?

240
00:36:52,286 --> 00:36:55,095
It must mean
some wrong awareness of self.

241
00:36:56,068 --> 00:36:58,536
Must we write it in our notebooks?

242
00:36:59,772 --> 00:37:01,239
I don't know.

243
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,134
Should we write that we talked alone?

244
00:37:09,948 --> 00:37:11,609
I always start it.

245
00:37:23,648 --> 00:37:27,277
Your training as a postulant
has been mostly in externals.

246
00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:30,315
Now, as novices,
you will be devoting the next year...

247
00:37:30,388 --> 00:37:32,686
to the real formation of a nun.

248
00:37:32,824 --> 00:37:36,385
During that entire year,
none of you will leave the Mother House.

249
00:37:36,928 --> 00:37:40,694
We will pay particular attention
to the removal of faults...

250
00:37:40,965 --> 00:37:44,385
the control of passions,
and the acquiring of virtue...

251
00:37:44,454 --> 00:37:46,854
so that you may be born again in Christ.

252
00:37:47,024 --> 00:37:51,188
We will have exercises to develop charity,
forbearance, and humility...

253
00:37:51,261 --> 00:37:53,695
and tests to destroy love of self.

254
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,928
Two of these tests
are the culpa and the penance.

255
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,395
From now on, in addition
to writing in your notebooks...

256
00:38:02,472 --> 00:38:03,871
you will once a week...

257
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:07,650
proclaim before your sisters
your external faults against the Rule.

258
00:38:07,724 --> 00:38:11,690
And you will be given a penance
to perform in refectory or in chapel.

259
00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:17,033
The degree of humiliation will tell you
how much pride is still alive in you.

260
00:38:17,908 --> 00:38:20,536
Only as your pride slowly crumble...

261
00:38:20,744 --> 00:38:23,542
will you get the first glimpse
of true humility.

262
00:38:24,448 --> 00:38:27,042
If any sister has observed you
in an external fault...

263
00:38:27,117 --> 00:38:28,584
which you have not proclaimed...

264
00:38:28,652 --> 00:38:30,552
it is her duty to proclaim you in charity...

265
00:38:30,621 --> 00:38:34,007
so that you may be aware
of your errors and correct them.

266
00:38:34,443 --> 00:38:39,073
I say my culpa for speaking without
necessity, for being late for chapel...

267
00:38:39,148 --> 00:38:41,548
for letting a door slam without penance.

268
00:38:46,055 --> 00:38:48,421
What do you have to say in charity?

269
00:38:48,491 --> 00:38:52,655
I proclaim my sister for giving in
to the temptation of vanity...

270
00:38:52,862 --> 00:38:55,626
by looking at herself in a glass window.

271
00:38:58,853 --> 00:39:01,583
You will say three Hail Marys
in refectory...

272
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:04,523
for the sister who had the charity
to proclaim you.

273
00:39:04,726 --> 00:39:07,661
And three Hail Marys
for each imperfection.

274
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:11,232
And pray God to help you
to perfect yourself.

275
00:39:13,835 --> 00:39:17,271
Mother, I will try to correct myself
with the grace of God.

276
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:30,429
I say my culpa
for breaking the rule of obedience...

277
00:39:30,504 --> 00:39:33,337
by not stopping work
when I heard the bell.

278
00:39:33,474 --> 00:39:36,568
For having spilled milk
twice in the refectory.

279
00:39:36,777 --> 00:39:40,338
For having spoken without necessity
during Grand Silence.

280
00:39:46,823 --> 00:39:49,239
What have you to say in charity?

281
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,112
I proclaim myself and Sister Luke...

282
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,590
for seeking each other's company.

283
00:40:09,962 --> 00:40:13,747
You will ask God to help you
to overcome this attachment...

284
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:18,851
and you will kiss the feet of the nuns
and beg your bread in refectory.

285
00:40:24,896 --> 00:40:28,923
Mother, I will try to correct myself
with the grace of God.

286
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:41,462
Dear Lord...

287
00:41:41,864 --> 00:41:44,662
the more I try,
the more imperfect I become.

288
00:41:45,368 --> 00:41:48,895
I seem to fail in charity,
humility, and obedience.

289
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:52,574
Pride has not been burned out of me.

290
00:41:54,696 --> 00:41:56,960
When I succeed in obeying the Rule...

291
00:41:57,032 --> 00:42:00,729
I fail at the same time
because I have pride in succeeding.

292
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:18,632
Tomorrow you go on retreat
before taking the first vows, don't you?

293
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,275
The Grand Silence doesn't matter for me.

294
00:42:21,343 --> 00:42:23,868
I'm not taking my vows. I'm leaving.

295
00:42:24,847 --> 00:42:28,578
So I can talk without having to say a culpa
or do a penance.

296
00:42:30,953 --> 00:42:32,011
Why?

297
00:42:32,755 --> 00:42:36,122
Mother Emmanuel said,
"Remember, you can cheat us...

298
00:42:36,191 --> 00:42:38,887
"but you cannot cheat yourself or God."

299
00:42:40,095 --> 00:42:42,906
Well, to go on would be cheating God.

300
00:42:43,885 --> 00:42:47,048
-To be a hypocrite.
-We all have our doubts.

301
00:42:47,688 --> 00:42:49,713
-My confessor--
-Of course.

302
00:42:50,091 --> 00:42:51,752
But I know myself.

303
00:42:52,927 --> 00:42:54,918
I could never be like you.

304
00:42:55,296 --> 00:42:56,957
As strong as you.

305
00:42:58,432 --> 00:43:00,423
I'm the weakest of us all.

306
00:43:00,501 --> 00:43:03,561
If you were,
you would not be taking your vows.

307
00:43:05,339 --> 00:43:09,385
Now I've earned you another penance
by talking to you in the Grand Silence.

308
00:43:09,462 --> 00:43:10,827
I'm sorry.

309
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:13,896
Goodbye.

310
00:43:17,304 --> 00:43:18,703
Pray for me.

311
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:57,628
"I, Gabrielle Van der Mal,
known as Sister Luke...

312
00:43:58,011 --> 00:44:02,077
"promise to God in the presence
of Your Grace and our Reverend Mother...

313
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,312
"to obey the Holy Rule
of this congregation...

314
00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:10,018
"and to persevere in the life
of obedience, chastity, and poverty...

315
00:44:10,295 --> 00:44:13,594
"for the period of three years. Amen."

316
00:45:36,841 --> 00:45:41,090
Sister Luke, this is the discipline
for penance in private.

317
00:45:41,563 --> 00:45:46,125
You will use it twice each week at night
while you are saying the Miserere.

318
00:45:47,268 --> 00:45:50,465
Remember, it is essentially
a symbol of penance.

319
00:45:50,905 --> 00:45:53,897
Too much is as bad as too little.

320
00:45:55,376 --> 00:45:58,812
Don't forget you are only an instrument.

321
00:45:59,547 --> 00:46:04,060
In yourself you are nothing,
until you are lifted up.

322
00:46:07,307 --> 00:46:11,437
Tomorrow you will leave for the School
of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp.

323
00:46:36,924 --> 00:46:38,255
Excuse me.

324
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:52,368
Your father's daughter. Excellent.

325
00:47:05,938 --> 00:47:07,303
Excuse me.

326
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:21,131
Well.

327
00:47:24,476 --> 00:47:27,172
Sister Pauline,
how long were you in the Congo?

328
00:47:27,412 --> 00:47:28,572
Seven years.

329
00:47:28,647 --> 00:47:31,047
You worked quite a lot with the lepers,
didn't you?

330
00:47:31,116 --> 00:47:32,413
-Yes.
-Yes!

331
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:35,884
Well, that is the bacillus
which causes leprosy!

332
00:47:36,988 --> 00:47:38,649
Thank you, Doctor.

333
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:46,577
I, too, have lost some of my quickness,
my memory...

334
00:47:47,484 --> 00:47:49,475
from too much Congo sun.

335
00:47:50,587 --> 00:47:52,214
Too much quinine.

336
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:57,620
If any of you think that the Congo
that you'll find today in 1930...

337
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:01,927
is anything like the Congo that we found
when we went there 20 years ago...

338
00:48:01,999 --> 00:48:03,830
you will be mistaken.

339
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:10,856
There are now bicycle paths
through the brush.

340
00:48:15,798 --> 00:48:18,733
Close that window, somebody,
will you? There.

341
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:24,506
I know you think it's hot.
Wait till you've had your share of malaria.

342
00:48:26,442 --> 00:48:29,741
Don't be selfish, Sister Luke,
help your sisters.

343
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:35,103
She was brought up
looking through a microscope, you know...

344
00:48:35,837 --> 00:48:39,034
whilst most of you
were playing with kaleidoscopes.

345
00:48:41,009 --> 00:48:44,638
Sister Luke, would you help me with this?

346
00:48:59,013 --> 00:49:01,914
That is the bacille de Koch
that causes tuberculosis.

347
00:49:01,982 --> 00:49:05,418
-I thought it was the leprosy bacillus.
-They are very alike.

348
00:49:05,486 --> 00:49:08,011
Both rod-shaped, both acid-fast...

349
00:49:08,456 --> 00:49:12,449
both with a slight shadow
almost like an enclosing capsule.

350
00:49:13,294 --> 00:49:15,057
But if you look very closely...

351
00:49:15,129 --> 00:49:19,294
you'll see that the leprosy bacillus
is slightly fatter and longer.

352
00:50:12,567 --> 00:50:13,771
Enter.

353
00:50:36,068 --> 00:50:38,415
I'm in trouble, Reverend Mother.

354
00:50:38,823 --> 00:50:40,586
It's Sister Pauline.

355
00:50:40,725 --> 00:50:44,958
My conscience is not at peace because
of my unfriendly feelings towards her.

356
00:50:46,832 --> 00:50:50,268
At the Mother House, we were told
to overcome feelings like this...

357
00:50:50,335 --> 00:50:52,269
by trying to help the person.

358
00:50:52,404 --> 00:50:55,840
For five months I've tried to help
Sister Pauline in the courses.

359
00:50:55,907 --> 00:50:57,374
She needs help.

360
00:50:58,176 --> 00:51:00,440
But she will not permit friendship...

361
00:51:01,013 --> 00:51:03,052
and so I do not know what to do.

362
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:05,532
Sister Pauline has already come to me.

363
00:51:05,903 --> 00:51:08,133
The feeling you describe is mutual.

364
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:11,335
She thinks you are full of pride.

365
00:51:11,843 --> 00:51:14,971
She does not believe
that you can ever achieve humility.

366
00:51:17,348 --> 00:51:20,681
I'm ashamed, My Mother,
for her and for me.

367
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:24,815
All this sounds very childish
when you tell it.

368
00:51:24,922 --> 00:51:27,731
Her dislike, I believe, is based on fear.

369
00:51:28,106 --> 00:51:31,740
She worries that she will
not be able to pass the examination.

370
00:51:31,815 --> 00:51:35,342
Or if she does,
that she will be far below you in grade.

371
00:51:35,886 --> 00:51:39,720
This could easily mean
that she could not return to the Congo.

372
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:45,451
You have been given a truly great
opportunity to make a sacrifice for God.

373
00:51:45,695 --> 00:51:47,822
You asked what you might do?

374
00:51:49,699 --> 00:51:51,497
Would you, Sister Luke...

375
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:54,818
be able to fail your examination
to show humility?

376
00:52:09,772 --> 00:52:11,171
My Mother...

377
00:52:14,843 --> 00:52:18,923
I would be willing if the Mother House
knows of this and approves.

378
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,197
Then it would be a humility with hooks,
as we say.

379
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:25,928
A humility that takes something back
for the sacrifice.

380
00:52:26,174 --> 00:52:30,440
In this case, the satisfaction of knowing
that the Mother House knows.

381
00:52:30,578 --> 00:52:33,012
-Courage needs witnesses.
-Yes.

382
00:52:33,448 --> 00:52:35,279
Real humility, on the other hand...

383
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:37,875
passes unperceived
between God and the soul.

384
00:52:38,186 --> 00:52:41,452
You have heard our phrase,
"Do good and disappear."

385
00:52:43,676 --> 00:52:46,111
How do we know when we are humble?

386
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,308
When we can accept a real humiliation.

387
00:52:49,716 --> 00:52:51,513
Such as this failure.

388
00:52:56,857 --> 00:52:59,485
How can I know God wants this from me?

389
00:52:59,893 --> 00:53:01,417
Go and ask Him.

390
00:53:01,795 --> 00:53:06,129
But remember, you are weighing an
opportunity that may never come again.

391
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:08,204
Out of His eternal time...

392
00:53:08,283 --> 00:53:11,450
God chooses His moment
to offer the most perfect alliance...

393
00:53:11,524 --> 00:53:13,549
with each individual soul.

394
00:53:21,967 --> 00:53:24,868
-Good morning, Sister Luke.
-Good morning, Doctor.

395
00:53:26,038 --> 00:53:30,305
I promised I would call your father
immediately after the examination.

396
00:53:32,555 --> 00:53:35,966
I shall defer to my eminent colleagues
for the first question.

397
00:53:37,636 --> 00:53:40,969
Sister, the board would like
to hear from you...

398
00:53:41,373 --> 00:53:45,275
in what parts of the tsetse fly
will the trypanosomes be found.

399
00:53:58,339 --> 00:54:00,971
You may take your time
with this question, Sister.

400
00:54:01,045 --> 00:54:03,980
We have been working on them
since the 1880s.

401
00:54:14,259 --> 00:54:16,489
They will be found in the....

402
00:54:19,597 --> 00:54:22,403
Perhaps you'd like the question repeated?

403
00:54:31,295 --> 00:54:33,855
In the tsetse fly,
the trypanosomes will be found...

404
00:54:33,931 --> 00:54:36,923
in the gut,
mouth parts, and salivary glands...

405
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,560
in all of which sites they multiply.

406
00:54:41,338 --> 00:54:45,775
We would like to hear a r¨¦sum¨¦ of the special clinical types of pernicious...

407
00:54:45,843 --> 00:54:49,025
as differentiated
from chronic or latent malaria.

408
00:54:49,198 --> 00:54:53,260
Cerebral, algid, bilious remittent fever,
blackwater fever...

409
00:54:53,337 --> 00:54:55,362
and bronchopneumonic form.

410
00:55:09,486 --> 00:55:10,919
I have good news.

411
00:55:10,988 --> 00:55:14,465
All four of our sisters
have passed their examinations.

412
00:55:18,381 --> 00:55:21,248
Sister Pauline will return to the Congo.

413
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:24,318
Sisters Timothy and Ellen...

414
00:55:24,754 --> 00:55:26,779
will go to the Congo, too.

415
00:55:27,556 --> 00:55:30,024
Sister Luke will leave tomorrow morning...

416
00:55:30,092 --> 00:55:34,085
to join the nursing staff
of our mental sanatorium near Brussels.

417
00:55:45,594 --> 00:55:49,291
Perhaps Reverend Mother feels
you are not yet ready for the Congo.

418
00:55:49,965 --> 00:55:53,196
You must learn to accept with love
whatever comes to you.

419
00:55:53,268 --> 00:55:55,702
It is essential in religious life.

420
00:55:56,338 --> 00:55:58,829
You passed fourth in a class of 80.

421
00:56:45,258 --> 00:56:48,318
Everything they do
is to be accepted as normal.

422
00:56:50,663 --> 00:56:53,077
Sister Agnes, Sister Luke.

423
00:56:53,752 --> 00:56:56,152
Good morning, Mother Christoph.

424
00:57:00,359 --> 00:57:02,919
Our practical nurses
stand a four-hour shift.

425
00:57:03,362 --> 00:57:07,458
Our sisters take unlimited duty,
sometimes from eight to 10 hours.

426
00:57:14,907 --> 00:57:18,221
These are the cells
for our most dangerous patients.

427
00:57:23,701 --> 00:57:26,192
We try to approach
even our most dangerous cases...

428
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:28,898
with gentle and persuasive reasoning.

429
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:37,545
Sister Berthold, this is Sister Luke,
who is to be with us for a while.

430
00:57:37,683 --> 00:57:39,617
-Sister Berthold.
-Sister Luke.

431
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:45,901
This one thinks
that she is the Archangel Gabriel.

432
00:57:45,977 --> 00:57:47,740
So we call her that.

433
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,905
Good afternoon, Archangel.

434
00:58:02,493 --> 00:58:05,053
She's a schizophrenic and very dangerous.

435
00:58:05,129 --> 00:58:09,710
She has perfectly sane periods when
she talks intelligently about her farm.

436
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:13,383
A sister is forbidden to open the door
of any of these cells...

437
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:17,358
unless there is another sister with her.
Or a practical helper.

438
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:21,521
One ought to be able to get through
to someone like her.

439
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:27,103
-Hello.
-Hello, Archangel.

440
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:32,948
This is the room where we give
the treatment for the violent cases.

441
00:58:33,527 --> 00:58:36,293
We keep them four to eight hours
in baths...

442
00:58:36,365 --> 00:58:38,629
maintained at a constant temperature.

443
00:58:41,303 --> 00:58:43,999
The sound that you hear are their heels...

444
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:46,603
beating up and down against the tubs.

445
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:48,308
Sister Marie is on duty.

446
00:58:48,377 --> 00:58:51,778
She generally remains there
from eight to 10 hours at a time.

447
00:59:12,788 --> 00:59:14,187
Sister Luke.

448
01:00:22,615 --> 01:00:24,674
It isn't one of my pleasantest duties...

449
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:27,583
opening and reading
other people's letters, but...

450
01:00:27,786 --> 01:00:30,516
sometimes it does allow me to help them.

451
01:00:30,756 --> 01:00:33,816
As you see,
your father asks an angry question.

452
01:00:34,493 --> 01:00:37,702
Why should you waste
all these months of your time here...

453
01:00:37,775 --> 01:00:41,013
after your strenuous courses
in tropical medicine?

454
01:00:41,352 --> 01:00:43,650
I must apologize for my father.

455
01:00:44,656 --> 01:00:46,920
Your father's a very great man.

456
01:00:46,991 --> 01:00:48,856
But I don't think he understands...

457
01:00:48,927 --> 01:00:53,261
that the colonies are only for sisters
perfected in the religious life.

458
01:00:54,265 --> 01:00:57,598
He asks what you could possibly learn
in this place.

459
01:00:57,836 --> 01:01:02,076
When I'm permitted to write to him
I will tell him what I can learn here:

460
01:01:02,148 --> 01:01:03,488
obedience.

461
01:01:06,363 --> 01:01:09,457
Perhaps that's what Mother Emmanuel
had in mind.

462
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:12,925
That this would make
an excellent proving ground.

463
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:14,402
I shall try.

464
01:01:15,272 --> 01:01:17,263
And I shall try with you...

465
01:01:17,508 --> 01:01:20,636
since your soul is in my care
while you are here.

466
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:22,804
Thank you, Reverend Mother.

467
01:02:25,667 --> 01:02:29,103
-Yes?
-I am so thirsty.

468
01:02:30,405 --> 01:02:32,930
May I have a drink of water, please?

469
01:02:36,278 --> 01:02:37,939
A terrible thirst.

470
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:40,545
The fish was so salty.

471
01:03:56,957 --> 01:03:58,227
Oh, God.

472
01:04:00,472 --> 01:04:01,734
God.

473
01:04:30,488 --> 01:04:31,477
Oh, God.

474
01:04:57,667 --> 01:04:59,134
The Archangel.

475
01:05:06,109 --> 01:05:09,101
Pride. Pride and disobedience.

476
01:05:11,148 --> 01:05:12,682
Always disobedience.

477
01:05:12,761 --> 01:05:16,568
Don't try to talk. I would probably
have done the same thing.

478
01:05:19,174 --> 01:05:23,907
I accuse myself also of pride in thinking
I could handle the Archangel myself.

479
01:05:24,446 --> 01:05:29,042
I accuse myself of using personal
judgment in not ringing the bell for help.

480
01:05:30,052 --> 01:05:32,520
I accuse myself of a sense of heroism.

481
01:05:33,355 --> 01:05:36,292
Mother, in the three days
I've been lying in the infirmary...

482
01:05:36,361 --> 01:05:39,278
I have accused myself
of almost every possible imperfection...

483
01:05:39,347 --> 01:05:41,008
against the Holy Rule.

484
01:05:41,082 --> 01:05:43,414
They are always such glaring faults.

485
01:05:43,484 --> 01:05:45,452
At the School of Tropical Medicine...

486
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:49,081
Mother Marcella offered me the chance
to show true humility...

487
01:05:49,157 --> 01:05:51,955
-by failing an examination.
-I know.

488
01:05:53,561 --> 01:05:55,586
Mother Marcella means well...

489
01:05:55,663 --> 01:05:59,100
but she was very wrong
to make that suggestion to you.

490
01:06:00,102 --> 01:06:04,717
My child, I don't underestimate for
a moment the seriousness of your faults.

491
01:06:05,393 --> 01:06:09,261
But you mustn't destroy yourself
with guilt and remorse.

492
01:06:10,131 --> 01:06:13,032
You must learn to bend a little
or you'll break.

493
01:06:13,101 --> 01:06:16,559
Long before I entered the order,
I had a rule of my own:

494
01:06:16,637 --> 01:06:18,161
All or nothing.

495
01:06:19,907 --> 01:06:22,137
I want to be a good nun or....

496
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:24,935
You will be a good nun, Sister Luke.

497
01:06:27,726 --> 01:06:31,192
I thought one would reach
some sort of resting place...

498
01:06:31,872 --> 01:06:35,399
where obedience would be natural
and struggle would end.

499
01:06:37,511 --> 01:06:39,843
There is no resting place. Ever.

500
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:42,939
But you must have patience with yourself.

501
01:06:43,016 --> 01:06:45,849
Unhappy saints are lost
from the beginning.

502
01:06:46,153 --> 01:06:48,587
Ask for God's help and guidance...

503
01:06:48,655 --> 01:06:51,124
and I know you will make your final vows.

504
01:06:57,249 --> 01:06:58,944
"I, Sister Luke...

505
01:06:59,018 --> 01:07:03,318
"promise to God in the presence of
Your Grace and of our Reverend Mother...

506
01:07:03,389 --> 01:07:06,119
"to persevere in the life of obedience...

507
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:08,192
"chastity, and poverty...

508
01:07:08,527 --> 01:07:10,586
"until death. Amen."

509
01:07:13,883 --> 01:07:15,578
I declare you from today...

510
01:07:15,652 --> 01:07:18,695
the bride of Jesus Christ,
Son of Almighty God.

511
01:07:33,022 --> 01:07:34,649
I declare you from today...

512
01:07:34,724 --> 01:07:37,784
the bride of Jesus Christ,
Son of Almighty God.

513
01:07:39,162 --> 01:07:43,913
-Mother, pray for me.
-My daughter, may God give you peace.

514
01:08:29,617 --> 01:08:31,715
Don't be proud of me, Father.

515
01:08:31,791 --> 01:08:33,667
This is really flight.

516
01:08:33,805 --> 01:08:37,709
It will be so much easier in the Congo
to remember I'm nothing.

517
01:08:37,777 --> 01:08:42,578
There will be no worldly associations
in a bush station, in the jungle.

518
01:09:11,797 --> 01:09:14,197
Please, God, let me do some good.

519
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:10,978
Where's Mother Mathilde?

520
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:14,477
We are very fortunate in Mother Mathilde.

521
01:11:18,052 --> 01:11:20,179
-Mama Augustine.
-Kalulu.

522
01:11:20,388 --> 01:11:23,755
-Welcome home, Mama Augustine.
-It's good to be back.

523
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,206
Ilunga. This is Sister Luke.

524
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,441
This is Kalulu.

525
01:11:30,618 --> 01:11:32,609
He practically runs the convent.

526
01:11:33,822 --> 01:11:36,552
Sister Augustine. Welcome back.

527
01:11:37,592 --> 01:11:38,854
Welcome.

528
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,393
-This is Sister Aurelie.
-Sister.

529
01:11:45,466 --> 01:11:46,524
Sister Luke.

530
01:11:46,601 --> 01:11:50,662
Now, a short boat trip across the Congo
and you're home.

531
01:12:08,609 --> 01:12:10,474
And there's the Congo.

532
01:13:07,044 --> 01:13:09,753
Drums tell your arrival, Mama Augustine.

533
01:13:09,827 --> 01:13:11,692
Yours, too, Mama Luke.

534
01:13:18,068 --> 01:13:20,502
What are the drums saying, Kalulu?

535
01:13:22,539 --> 01:13:25,030
Mama Augustine, she can read drums.

536
01:13:56,261 --> 01:13:57,359
Sister Luke....

537
01:13:57,435 --> 01:14:01,212
I thought it might amuse you to know
what the drums said about you last night.

538
01:14:01,283 --> 01:14:04,150
The way Kalulu laughed,
it must be something very funny.

539
01:14:04,219 --> 01:14:05,413
They said:

540
01:14:05,487 --> 01:14:08,422
"Held hands with Big Mama Mathilde
on way back to Sister House...

541
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:11,857
"therefore esteemed.
Talks little, looks much.

542
01:14:12,194 --> 01:14:14,526
"Young enough to bear children."

543
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:28,261
We call her the Novice.

544
01:14:29,564 --> 01:14:33,557
But like all little novices,
she's still imperfect in discipline.

545
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:39,039
Come along with me now on my rounds.
We'll start with the native hospital.

546
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:41,905
How we've needed
this extra pair of hands.

547
01:15:20,620 --> 01:15:22,952
"Yambo"means hello.
But of course you know that.

548
01:15:23,022 --> 01:15:24,546
-You've been studying.
-Yes.

549
01:15:26,459 --> 01:15:29,155
-Mama Luke.
-Yambo, Mama Luke.

550
01:15:29,562 --> 01:15:33,123
Only one generation ago,
their fathers were savages in the forest.

551
01:15:33,199 --> 01:15:35,394
We couldn't run the hospital
without them.

552
01:15:35,468 --> 01:15:37,844
You'll notice
we haven't converted them all yet.

553
01:15:37,915 --> 01:15:41,724
Some still wear the witch doctor's fetish
around their necks.

554
01:15:46,699 --> 01:15:49,167
That is our surgeon, Dr. Fortunati.

555
01:15:49,235 --> 01:15:51,328
He spends half his time here.

556
01:15:51,404 --> 01:15:54,396
The rest of the day
he operates in the white hospital.

557
01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:17,214
I'm afraid she's too fast for me...

558
01:16:17,282 --> 01:16:19,978
but nursing them every day, I'll learn.

559
01:16:32,783 --> 01:16:35,479
I see our chaplain, Father Andre, is here.

560
01:16:35,586 --> 01:16:36,917
He is greatly loved.

561
01:16:36,987 --> 01:16:39,615
Even the non-Catholics
hold their children up to him...

562
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:41,885
to be blessed when he passes.

563
01:16:41,893 --> 01:16:43,155
Father Andre...

564
01:16:43,227 --> 01:16:45,388
you have a new soul to look after.

565
01:16:45,463 --> 01:16:47,431
-Sister Luke.
-Sister.

566
01:16:47,498 --> 01:16:49,523
-Father.
-We're so glad you are here.

567
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,801
We do need another pair of hands.

568
01:16:51,875 --> 01:16:54,652
The barber's been itching
to get at that beard for years...

569
01:16:54,724 --> 01:16:57,022
but the natives
have a picture of God with a beard...

570
01:16:57,093 --> 01:16:59,584
so priests have to wear beards
in the Congo.

571
01:16:59,663 --> 01:17:02,826
No beard, no converts. Excuse me, please.

572
01:17:45,097 --> 01:17:49,397
We're only beginning to persuade them
to come to hospital to have their babies.

573
01:17:49,468 --> 01:17:51,663
Not all of them trust us, yet.

574
01:17:51,737 --> 01:17:54,865
Many of them still prefer
to deliver themselves in the bush.

575
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:57,465
They scoop out a hole and that's it.

576
01:18:04,962 --> 01:18:07,874
That's how they call
our children to school.

577
01:19:53,568 --> 01:19:55,001
-Sister.
-Sister.

578
01:19:55,069 --> 01:19:58,698
Sister is teaching the mothers
how to wash their children.

579
01:20:00,875 --> 01:20:03,366
You know,
I had hoped to go to the bush station...

580
01:20:03,444 --> 01:20:06,641
but seeing all of this,
I'm very happy to be here.

581
01:20:07,715 --> 01:20:10,240
But Mother Emmanuel sent you a cable,
didn't she?

582
01:20:10,318 --> 01:20:12,260
Yes, that I was to be here with you.

583
01:20:12,328 --> 01:20:15,672
With us, yes,
but not at the native hospital.

584
01:20:16,309 --> 01:20:19,938
Across the way, at the white hospital,
with the Europeans.

585
01:20:43,656 --> 01:20:47,148
One of the nurses here got TB
and we had to send her home.

586
01:20:47,226 --> 01:20:50,320
TB makes further service
in the Congo impossible...

587
01:20:50,396 --> 01:20:52,887
so you'll have to hold down
two jobs over there.

588
01:20:52,965 --> 01:20:56,230
Supervising the nurses
and assisting Dr. Fortunati.

589
01:20:58,370 --> 01:20:59,769
I'm sorry...

590
01:21:00,372 --> 01:21:03,183
but it's a lesson
we all have to learn, isn't it?

591
01:21:03,556 --> 01:21:05,153
Disappointments.

592
01:21:05,497 --> 01:21:07,226
We'll go there now.

593
01:21:25,483 --> 01:21:28,055
-Good morning, Mama Mathilde.
-Ilunga, this is Sister Luke.

594
01:21:28,131 --> 01:21:29,297
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

595
01:21:29,373 --> 01:21:32,274
Ilunga will be your deputy here
at the hospital.

596
01:21:32,342 --> 01:21:33,468
Good.

597
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:56,180
You will be assisting Dr. Fortunati here.

598
01:21:56,652 --> 01:21:59,280
He is a genius and a devil.

599
01:21:59,889 --> 01:22:02,323
He works himself to exhaustion...

600
01:22:02,391 --> 01:22:04,154
and his nurses, too.

601
01:22:04,727 --> 01:22:07,161
I'm used to doctors. My father....

602
01:22:09,098 --> 01:22:10,793
I'm sorry, I forgot.

603
01:22:10,866 --> 01:22:13,994
Your father is a great surgeon. I know.

604
01:22:15,237 --> 01:22:18,619
You must always leave surgery
the moment operations are over.

605
01:22:18,689 --> 01:22:21,059
You must never linger to discuss a case.

606
01:22:21,129 --> 01:22:24,155
You will be tempted to
because he is a marvel.

607
01:22:24,566 --> 01:22:26,966
But remember, he is also a man...

608
01:22:27,035 --> 01:22:28,332
a bachelor...

609
01:22:28,403 --> 01:22:30,598
and I'm afraid an unbeliever.

610
01:22:30,772 --> 01:22:35,266
Don't ever think for an instant, Sister,
that your habit will protect you.

611
01:22:36,411 --> 01:22:39,347
Now, I leave you
to look over your equipment.

612
01:22:40,583 --> 01:22:41,988
Yes, Mother.

613
01:23:43,236 --> 01:23:47,070
You will say six A ves and a Pater Noster
for that bit of vanity, Sister.

614
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:50,132
I'm Dr. Fortunati.
You must be the new sister.

615
01:23:50,877 --> 01:23:53,471
-Yes, I'm Sister Luke.
-How do you do?

616
01:23:54,113 --> 01:23:57,055
-How do you do?
-Well, the drums were right.

617
01:23:58,632 --> 01:24:01,334
I see somebody told you what they said.

618
01:24:02,074 --> 01:24:04,804
I believe I'm to assist you
in the operating room, Doctor.

619
01:24:04,877 --> 01:24:06,071
Yes.

620
01:24:06,145 --> 01:24:08,636
I hope you bear up longer
than the last sister.

621
01:24:08,714 --> 01:24:10,306
I can only try.

622
01:24:11,417 --> 01:24:15,012
These summer months this room gets
like a bake-oven by 9:00 in the morning...

623
01:24:15,087 --> 01:24:18,386
so I operate at 5:00.
That means you get up at 4:00.

624
01:24:18,825 --> 01:24:20,292
I'll be here.

625
01:24:20,393 --> 01:24:23,502
And sometimes I operate
right through the time of your mass.

626
01:24:23,578 --> 01:24:25,641
So you'll get used to taking communion...

627
01:24:25,717 --> 01:24:28,083
at that door there, on those occasions.

628
01:24:28,153 --> 01:24:30,348
I'll have to ask permission
of Reverend Mother.

629
01:24:30,422 --> 01:24:33,550
Reverend Mother is not in charge here.
This is a government hospital.

630
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:36,059
-Still, I'll--
-You're paid by the government...

631
01:24:36,128 --> 01:24:38,619
and therefore, you're responsible to them.

632
01:24:38,697 --> 01:24:41,029
They don't pay you to pray,
but to assist me.

633
01:24:41,099 --> 01:24:42,896
-I understand that.
-It's all right.

634
01:24:42,968 --> 01:24:45,699
The Reverend Mother's
given permission to the operating sisters.

635
01:24:45,773 --> 01:24:50,227
I can't have my nurses running off to mass
in the middle of an operation.

636
01:24:50,928 --> 01:24:52,691
5:00 in the morning?

637
01:24:52,830 --> 01:24:55,355
Have you ever assisted
at an operation before?

638
01:24:55,433 --> 01:24:58,425
Yes. My father's Dr. Hubert Van der Mal.

639
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:01,101
I see.

640
01:25:01,272 --> 01:25:03,331
You'll say another five A ves
and beg your soup...

641
01:25:03,407 --> 01:25:05,875
for that little display of pride, Sister.

642
01:25:39,581 --> 01:25:41,344
These boys had better be trained to do...

643
01:25:41,417 --> 01:25:43,442
more than just stand around
dropping things.

644
01:25:43,519 --> 01:25:45,919
Yes, Doctor, I'll work with them.

645
01:25:46,088 --> 01:25:47,316
Tighter.

646
01:25:54,163 --> 01:25:56,028
Don't you faint on me.

647
01:25:57,032 --> 01:25:58,260
I won't.

648
01:25:59,268 --> 01:26:01,468
I asked Mother Mathilde
to let the operating sister...

649
01:26:01,542 --> 01:26:04,354
have something to eat before she came in
the morning, but she won't.

650
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:06,416
-So if you faint on me--
-I won't faint, Doctor...

651
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:09,930
if you promise not to eat garlic again
the night before an operation.

652
01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:13,123
All right, I promise.

653
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:19,366
All right, go on.

654
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:03,617
When you've been at this longer,
I'll explain what I was doing.

655
01:27:03,690 --> 01:27:05,954
Your being the daughter
of Dr. Van der Mal...

656
01:27:06,026 --> 01:27:08,017
I expect you could instruct me.

657
01:27:08,829 --> 01:27:11,764
Please don't mention
my father again, Doctor.

658
01:27:38,544 --> 01:27:40,811
-Good morning, Reverend Mother.
-Good morning.

659
01:27:40,883 --> 01:27:43,923
I wouldn't say their hands are as gentle
as Sister Luke's...

660
01:27:44,001 --> 01:27:45,731
but then whose are?

661
01:27:48,406 --> 01:27:51,102
This is certainly a great step forward.

662
01:27:51,810 --> 01:27:56,247
I'd like to borrow Sister Luke
to organize our boys in the textile mills.

663
01:27:58,917 --> 01:28:01,010
Just a moment, Sister Luke.

664
01:28:09,647 --> 01:28:12,810
I had a telephone call
from the Bishop last night.

665
01:28:12,884 --> 01:28:16,047
He had read your name in the paper
and heard your name on the drums...

666
01:28:16,121 --> 01:28:18,521
about making some innovations here.

667
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:21,787
He asked me what I knew about it.
I had no answer.

668
01:28:22,327 --> 01:28:25,091
It didn't occur to me to ask for permission.

669
01:28:25,163 --> 01:28:29,429
He also asked me why one of my nuns
was trying to singularize herself.

670
01:28:35,325 --> 01:28:37,555
I've failed you, Reverend Mother.

671
01:28:37,628 --> 01:28:42,224
A superior must know what is happening
in a hospital entrusted to her care.

672
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,000
You have done something very important.

673
01:28:46,069 --> 01:28:48,629
Your only fault
is in not telling me in advance...

674
01:28:48,705 --> 01:28:51,037
and saving me the embarrassment.

675
01:29:13,449 --> 01:29:15,314
-Mama Luke.
-Yes, Emil?

676
01:29:15,985 --> 01:29:17,953
Where are your husbands?

677
01:29:19,121 --> 01:29:21,150
I don't understand, Emil.

678
01:29:21,229 --> 01:29:24,679
Where are the husbands
of the white mamas at the house?

679
01:29:24,746 --> 01:29:26,873
Have you asked Mama Mathilde
about this?

680
01:29:26,948 --> 01:29:28,973
-Yes.
-What did she say?

681
01:29:29,117 --> 01:29:31,984
Something about you all being
the wives of one man.

682
01:29:32,053 --> 01:29:33,850
But I know that can't be right.

683
01:29:33,922 --> 01:29:37,050
Father Andre says it's wrong
to have more than one wife.

684
01:29:37,292 --> 01:29:39,590
Well, it's not easy to explain.

685
01:29:39,661 --> 01:29:43,893
I can understand some of the others
not having husbands, but not you.

686
01:29:44,299 --> 01:29:46,774
The fact is, Emil, I have one.

687
01:29:47,244 --> 01:29:50,348
-Well, I thought you would.
-But he's in Heaven.

688
01:29:50,524 --> 01:29:52,321
I'm sorry, Mama Luke.

689
01:29:52,626 --> 01:29:54,150
I'm very sorry.

690
01:30:12,489 --> 01:30:15,365
Can you do without me
for a few days, Sister?

691
01:30:15,435 --> 01:30:18,427
-What do you mean, Doctor?
-Well, I think we both need a rest.

692
01:30:18,504 --> 01:30:21,473
I'm going up to Lake Kivu
for the weekend to do some fishing.

693
01:30:21,541 --> 01:30:22,633
I see.

694
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:25,701
Give you a chance
to catch up on your prayers.

695
01:30:28,214 --> 01:30:29,875
If there's an emergency?

696
01:30:29,949 --> 01:30:32,315
Well, send for one of the doctors
in the town.

697
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,649
Keep up the morphine
with the terminal cancer.

698
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:37,827
But don't touch the dressings
on the skin graft.

699
01:30:38,875 --> 01:30:40,469
You'd better get some rest yourself.

700
01:30:40,545 --> 01:30:42,979
I've been working you pretty hard
in the last few months.

701
01:30:43,048 --> 01:30:45,573
I'm all right. Have a fine weekend.

702
01:30:47,486 --> 01:30:49,454
Did you ever go fishing?

703
01:30:52,858 --> 01:30:56,522
It's impossible to talk to somebody
who's not allowed to remember.

704
01:30:56,596 --> 01:30:58,257
See you on Monday.

705
01:31:37,842 --> 01:31:40,174
Sister, the mission just called.

706
01:31:41,378 --> 01:31:45,314
Father Andre has had a bad accident.
They're bringing him here.

707
01:31:45,749 --> 01:31:48,877
See if you can still find Dr. Fortunati,
please, Sister.

708
01:32:00,116 --> 01:32:03,483
Call one of the town doctors
for surgery immediately.

709
01:32:15,098 --> 01:32:17,703
-Is the leg very bad?
-It's shattered.

710
01:32:18,181 --> 01:32:20,588
The doctor will have to amputate.

711
01:32:27,230 --> 01:32:31,223
They can't reach a doctor.
I left one of the boys to keep trying.

712
01:32:34,704 --> 01:32:38,606
In that case, we'll have to do
the best we can to save the leg.

713
01:33:00,515 --> 01:33:05,077
I'd like to save you from the sin of pride,
Sister, but I'm afraid I can't.

714
01:33:05,824 --> 01:33:08,932
This may take nearly a year
to mend completely.

715
01:33:09,744 --> 01:33:12,474
But you've saved the Father and his leg.

716
01:33:20,588 --> 01:33:23,148
Mother Mathilde and Sister Aurelie
assisted me.

717
01:33:23,224 --> 01:33:27,388
Yes, and all the other nuns praying
for you back at the Mother House. I know.

718
01:33:27,461 --> 01:33:29,793
But you were the one who did it.

719
01:33:40,327 --> 01:33:43,455
It's a photograph of a final x-ray
of Father Andre's leg.

720
01:33:43,530 --> 01:33:47,057
It's just to remind you
what an excellent nurse you are.

721
01:33:49,769 --> 01:33:51,100
Mother Mathilde's making a trip...

722
01:33:51,171 --> 01:33:53,469
up the river next month
to visit the bush stations.

723
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:55,098
I'm going to send you along, too...

724
01:33:55,175 --> 01:33:58,622
to make the annual leprosy check
on Father Vermeuhlen.

725
01:33:59,125 --> 01:34:01,656
-I see you don't know about him.
-No.

726
01:34:02,501 --> 01:34:05,959
Well, he's known as
the White Saint of the Leper Colony.

727
01:34:06,038 --> 01:34:07,699
The trip will do you good.

728
01:34:07,773 --> 01:34:09,934
And meeting Father Vermeuhlen will, too.

729
01:34:10,009 --> 01:34:13,069
Religion hasn't made him
tense and disciplined.

730
01:34:16,081 --> 01:34:20,074
-A nun is a disciplined person.
-Yes, but not necessarily tense.

731
01:34:20,352 --> 01:34:23,158
As a surgeon, it's not my business
to probe into the mind...

732
01:34:23,231 --> 01:34:27,371
but I'd say that tension is a sign
of an exhausting inner struggle.

733
01:34:31,716 --> 01:34:33,377
The Grand Silence?

734
01:34:35,420 --> 01:34:37,945
Do you realize
that every time you talk to me like this...

735
01:34:38,022 --> 01:34:42,254
I should go down on my knees
before my sisters and proclaim my fault?

736
01:34:46,867 --> 01:34:48,204
I'm sorry.

737
01:35:56,926 --> 01:35:58,951
There's Father Vermeuhlen.

738
01:36:08,089 --> 01:36:11,422
Father Vermeuhlen was
one of the first missionaries in the Congo.

739
01:36:11,493 --> 01:36:13,791
He lived all alone in the bush.

740
01:36:14,095 --> 01:36:17,292
One day he disappeared,
they thought he was dead.

741
01:36:17,599 --> 01:36:20,966
But years later they found him.
Living with a native.

742
01:36:21,569 --> 01:36:23,264
As penance for his sins...

743
01:36:23,338 --> 01:36:27,038
he asked to be allowed to devote
the rest of his life to the lepers.

744
01:37:52,971 --> 01:37:55,906
Well, I'll show you the rest of the station.

745
01:38:04,850 --> 01:38:08,318
It's a makeshift,
but at least they're being cared for.

746
01:38:08,397 --> 01:38:12,570
If left in the forest with their tribes,
they'd be abandoned to die.

747
01:38:12,877 --> 01:38:15,277
Do they realize how ill they are?

748
01:38:15,579 --> 01:38:18,878
Somehow we're all of us
protected from full realization.

749
01:38:19,216 --> 01:38:21,081
How's that rascal Fortunati?

750
01:38:21,152 --> 01:38:23,643
He gave me complete instructions
about you.

751
01:38:23,721 --> 01:38:25,746
All the tests I must make.

752
01:38:26,590 --> 01:38:28,785
Well, we can forget about the tests.

753
01:38:29,260 --> 01:38:33,468
I know they're a nuisance,
but that is the real reason for our trip.

754
01:38:39,422 --> 01:38:42,357
He always said
it was just a matter of time.

755
01:39:39,621 --> 01:39:42,146
Reverend Mother, I'm sorry to ask again...

756
01:39:42,224 --> 01:39:44,818
but may I have permission
to be absent from vespers?

757
01:39:44,893 --> 01:39:47,128
There are some slides I must--

758
01:39:47,603 --> 01:39:49,407
Thank you, Reverend Mother.

759
01:40:31,478 --> 01:40:33,912
What are we going to do about you?

760
01:40:35,215 --> 01:40:36,880
We operated at 5:00 in the morning.

761
01:40:36,954 --> 01:40:40,336
It's now after midnight
and we operate again at 5:00.

762
01:40:41,942 --> 01:40:43,432
I'll be there.

763
01:40:43,744 --> 01:40:46,474
But how many more days
will you be there?

764
01:40:47,347 --> 01:40:49,440
What'll I do if you're not?

765
01:40:54,554 --> 01:40:58,081
You comfort your patients
by listening to their troubles.

766
01:40:58,158 --> 01:40:59,955
Who listens to yours?

767
01:41:01,463 --> 01:41:04,741
I'm responsible for the health
of the patients in this hospital.

768
01:41:04,814 --> 01:41:06,808
And for your health, too.

769
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:08,944
You go to bed.

770
01:42:02,513 --> 01:42:05,346
I don't know what to do, Doctor. I have TB.

771
01:42:06,884 --> 01:42:08,283
Who says so?

772
01:42:09,853 --> 01:42:11,514
Who told you that?

773
01:42:11,622 --> 01:42:13,283
I just made a test.

774
01:42:13,357 --> 01:42:15,825
It will mean my going back to Europe.

775
01:42:15,893 --> 01:42:18,737
But you're the only one
in the whole Congo I can work with.

776
01:42:18,806 --> 01:42:20,440
I can't lose you.

777
01:42:23,553 --> 01:42:25,248
Let's have a look.

778
01:42:25,721 --> 01:42:27,780
I'm not allowed.
I should call another sister.

779
01:42:27,857 --> 01:42:29,518
Let's have a look.

780
01:42:57,839 --> 01:42:59,170
I'm ready.

781
01:43:01,109 --> 01:43:04,476
You're never wrong,
but let's hope this time you are.

782
01:43:11,905 --> 01:43:13,634
Take a deep breath.

783
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:20,745
And again.

784
01:43:25,285 --> 01:43:26,684
And again.

785
01:43:30,859 --> 01:43:32,195
And again.

786
01:43:37,751 --> 01:43:39,082
Now cough.

787
01:43:40,721 --> 01:43:41,949
Breathe.

788
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:47,320
Cough.

789
01:43:48,962 --> 01:43:50,190
Breathe.

790
01:43:59,923 --> 01:44:01,393
We're lucky, Sister.

791
01:44:01,461 --> 01:44:05,261
It's a small summit lesion,
and I think we've got it in time.

792
01:44:15,675 --> 01:44:17,836
You can stand the gold treatment.

793
01:44:17,910 --> 01:44:20,276
It's a bit rough on the kidneys,
but you're strong.

794
01:44:20,346 --> 01:44:22,547
I'll take the responsibility.

795
01:44:22,756 --> 01:44:25,531
-I'll have to tell Mother Mathilde.
-Why?

796
01:44:26,271 --> 01:44:28,398
Obedience. I must.

797
01:44:28,507 --> 01:44:30,839
They'll send you home if you do.

798
01:44:38,416 --> 01:44:39,644
I know.

799
01:44:42,587 --> 01:44:46,960
You're afraid you won't be able to
stand the convent if they send you back.

800
01:44:48,537 --> 01:44:51,015
I'm going to tell you
something about yourself, Sister.

801
01:44:51,082 --> 01:44:54,279
I've never worked with any other kind
of nurse except nuns since I began.

802
01:44:54,352 --> 01:44:57,788
And you're not in the mold, Sister.
You never will be.

803
01:44:58,690 --> 01:45:00,851
You're what's called a worldly nun.

804
01:45:01,059 --> 01:45:03,459
ldeal for the public, ideal for the patients.

805
01:45:03,528 --> 01:45:06,895
But you see things your own way.
You stick to your own ideas.

806
01:45:06,965 --> 01:45:11,129
You'll never be the kind of nun
that your convent expects you to be.

807
01:45:11,204 --> 01:45:13,008
That's your illness.

808
01:45:13,146 --> 01:45:15,054
The TB is a byproduct.

809
01:45:17,628 --> 01:45:20,563
I can cure the byproduct,
if you want me to.

810
01:45:21,999 --> 01:45:23,523
I want to stay.

811
01:45:24,301 --> 01:45:25,996
All right, leave it to me.

812
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:29,904
I'll tell the Mother Superior in such a way
that she can't send you home.

813
01:45:29,974 --> 01:45:31,874
We'll put you up in the little pavilion...

814
01:45:31,942 --> 01:45:34,433
where you'll be sleeping
practically in the treetops.

815
01:45:34,511 --> 01:45:37,314
-How long?
-Five, six months, perhaps.

816
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:40,694
But remember,
I'm only working on the byproduct.

817
01:45:40,770 --> 01:45:43,295
The main illness is for you to cure.

818
01:45:45,475 --> 01:45:46,737
I'll try.

819
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:53,373
Anything you knew before I did,
keep under your bonnet if you can.

820
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,615
That is, unless your pride...

821
01:45:58,688 --> 01:46:02,424
as a genius of the microscope
doesn't get the better of you.

822
01:46:03,938 --> 01:46:06,107
I'll take an x-ray in the morning.

823
01:46:27,810 --> 01:46:29,043
Come in.

824
01:46:33,027 --> 01:46:35,996
His name is Felix and Mother Mathilde
said you might have him.

825
01:46:36,063 --> 01:46:37,257
Really?

826
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:40,264
Ilunga gave him to me.

827
01:46:40,668 --> 01:46:44,035
I'd rather he'd given me that fetish
from around his neck.

828
01:46:49,977 --> 01:46:53,353
This reminds me of a tree house
that I had when I....

829
01:47:01,441 --> 01:47:03,272
Anything you want, you ask for it.

830
01:47:03,343 --> 01:47:06,403
Because Dr. Fortunati says
you're to be pampered.

831
01:47:06,279 --> 01:47:08,008
Isn't it wonderful?

832
01:47:10,383 --> 01:47:12,010
Thanks for Felix.

833
01:47:56,368 --> 01:47:58,700
Refuse nothing. Ask for nothing.

834
01:48:00,906 --> 01:48:03,739
It's a prairie oyster. Swallow it quickly.

835
01:48:11,336 --> 01:48:15,033
Each night at 10:00 you'll be awakened
with sandwiches and two glasses of wine.

836
01:48:15,106 --> 01:48:16,300
I see.

837
01:48:17,108 --> 01:48:19,599
The drums have already started
passing the word...

838
01:48:19,677 --> 01:48:22,976
so by tomorrow we'll be swamped
with food and drink for Sister Luke.

839
01:48:23,982 --> 01:48:25,313
Don't cry.

840
01:48:26,985 --> 01:48:29,112
Don't think too much. Relax.

841
01:48:30,021 --> 01:48:33,056
Live life as it comes. From day to day.

842
01:48:34,473 --> 01:48:37,379
I want you to drink
as much of this Belgian beer as you can.

843
01:48:37,447 --> 01:48:41,076
Unless you want to come out
of this gold dust cure with ruined kidneys.

844
01:48:41,151 --> 01:48:42,413
How can I drink so much--

845
01:48:42,486 --> 01:48:46,115
It's all right, there's nobody
to see you here except him.

846
01:48:50,694 --> 01:48:52,821
And you know about monkeys.

847
01:48:55,899 --> 01:48:58,708
That's right. It's good to see you laugh.

848
01:49:00,255 --> 01:49:02,282
You keep laughing, Sister.

849
01:49:03,627 --> 01:49:04,821
I will.

850
01:49:09,032 --> 01:49:12,263
I said rest. Absolute rest.

851
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:43,211
Thank you, Mother.

852
01:49:45,054 --> 01:49:48,226
I don't know if I'm well yet,
but I feel so well.

853
01:49:48,334 --> 01:49:50,069
So completely well.

854
01:49:50,409 --> 01:49:53,869
It's strange that I had to fall ill to learn
to take each day and each night...

855
01:49:53,948 --> 01:49:57,042
as a gift from God. Without struggle.

856
01:49:57,519 --> 01:50:00,545
It seems impossible,
but when I say my culpa to you next...

857
01:50:00,622 --> 01:50:04,581
I don't think I'll have any imperfections
against the Rule to proclaim.

858
01:50:04,659 --> 01:50:08,527
Except that tonight
you talked during the Grand Silence.

859
01:50:25,365 --> 01:50:27,595
That's a whole week of normal.

860
01:50:28,902 --> 01:50:32,770
You're allowed to have pride, Doctor.
Take pride in your cure.

861
01:50:32,973 --> 01:50:34,497
Are you cured?

862
01:50:34,775 --> 01:50:37,649
The slides and the temperature seem to....

863
01:50:39,795 --> 01:50:44,031
-It'll be good to have you back in surgery.
-It'll be good to be useful again.

864
01:50:44,103 --> 01:50:45,502
Don't rush it, Sister.

865
01:50:45,571 --> 01:50:47,766
It's not going to be easy
to return to the community.

866
01:50:47,840 --> 01:50:51,332
Even to this select little gathering
here in the Congo.

867
01:50:55,114 --> 01:50:56,206
I'm going to miss this.

868
01:51:00,886 --> 01:51:02,016
Well.

869
01:51:22,193 --> 01:51:23,888
At least he's curious.

870
01:51:23,962 --> 01:51:27,404
If I could only get him
into the chapel Christmas Eve.

871
01:51:31,755 --> 01:51:34,383
Well, what do you think of it, Ilunga?

872
01:51:36,126 --> 01:51:37,889
It's for the chapel.

873
01:51:38,996 --> 01:51:40,486
Christmas Eve.

874
01:51:46,603 --> 01:51:49,300
Come in. Come in and have a look at it.

875
01:52:02,406 --> 01:52:04,397
I'm afraid not this year.

876
01:52:06,343 --> 01:52:09,278
I would give anything
if I could convert him.

877
01:52:34,524 --> 01:52:36,583
You spoil them, Sister.

878
01:52:36,959 --> 01:52:39,826
It's one of our building boys
who's come for first aid.

879
01:52:39,896 --> 01:52:43,306
You think if you bandage their fingers,
you'll get their souls.

880
01:52:43,375 --> 01:52:45,374
Well, maybe you're right.

881
01:52:46,888 --> 01:52:48,515
No, inside. Dispensary.

882
01:52:50,992 --> 01:52:52,186
No, inside.

883
01:53:49,089 --> 01:53:51,057
Ilunga, help me lift her.

884
01:53:52,459 --> 01:53:53,858
Ilunga.

885
01:53:58,542 --> 01:54:00,745
She is dead, Reverend Mother.

886
01:54:25,796 --> 01:54:27,025
Ilunga.

887
01:54:30,235 --> 01:54:34,171
If you're on your way to contagion,
please take these to Sister Raphael.

888
01:54:42,981 --> 01:54:45,176
-I don't understand.
-What?

889
01:54:45,317 --> 01:54:47,050
You're not angry with us?

890
01:54:47,157 --> 01:54:50,662
-There's no place in our hearts for anger.
-But this killing, Mama Luke.

891
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:52,231
Not even then.

892
01:54:53,678 --> 01:54:55,669
Why did he do it, Ilunga?

893
01:54:55,780 --> 01:54:58,613
A witch doctor told him
that if he killed a white woman...

894
01:54:58,683 --> 01:55:01,516
he'd be rid of the ghost of his dead wife.

895
01:55:02,353 --> 01:55:03,980
I feel sorry for him.

896
01:55:03,755 --> 01:55:05,347
If such a death happened with us...

897
01:55:05,423 --> 01:55:08,187
we'd tie the murderer to a stake
and cut his body for fish bait.

898
01:55:08,259 --> 01:55:11,196
But we would not.
We've been taught to forgive.

899
01:55:11,265 --> 01:55:15,044
That's what you must try
and make the other boys understand.

900
01:55:23,894 --> 01:55:27,796
Tell the boys we hope they'll all come
to chapel Christmas Eve.

901
01:55:29,766 --> 01:55:31,666
Maybe even you, Ilunga.

902
01:57:41,130 --> 01:57:44,509
Sometime this afternoon
we'll discus the Englebert case.

903
01:57:44,578 --> 01:57:47,575
I want to give you instructions for the trip.

904
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:50,783
-The trip?
-Yes. Hasn't Mother Mathilde told you?

905
01:57:51,023 --> 01:57:52,149
What?

906
01:57:52,458 --> 01:57:56,189
I have to send you back to Belgium.
With the Englebert case.

907
01:58:00,099 --> 01:58:04,160
You are the only one qualified.
The only one we can possibly send.

908
01:58:04,537 --> 01:58:06,532
He is important to the colony.

909
01:58:06,611 --> 01:58:09,180
And we can only avoid
a complete mental breakdown...

910
01:58:09,256 --> 01:58:12,594
if we get him to a sanitarium
with proper facilities.

911
01:58:12,664 --> 01:58:14,256
Of course, Mother.

912
01:58:14,332 --> 01:58:18,428
I hope the Mother House
will return you to us as soon as possible.

913
01:58:18,737 --> 01:58:21,103
In the meantime, at long last...

914
01:58:21,506 --> 01:58:25,909
they are sending me another sister
with qualifications similar to yours.

915
01:58:28,713 --> 01:58:32,247
Dr. Fortunati will give you instructions
about the case.

916
01:58:32,424 --> 01:58:34,296
We shall all miss you.

917
01:58:34,869 --> 01:58:38,808
You'll have native guards to help you
on the train as far as the coast.

918
01:58:38,876 --> 01:58:41,902
After that, the ship's doctor
will share the responsibility.

919
01:58:41,979 --> 01:58:45,642
I'll give you a supply of sedatives
in case he needs them.

920
01:58:45,849 --> 01:58:48,579
Do you think they'll send you back here?

921
01:58:48,652 --> 01:58:50,142
I don't know.

922
01:58:50,788 --> 01:58:53,780
-There's going to be a war in Europe.
-I know.

923
01:58:55,928 --> 01:58:59,776
They tell me somebody else is coming out
to fill in for you or take your place.

924
01:58:59,846 --> 01:59:02,079
-Yes.
-Somebody else will have to train her.

925
01:59:02,151 --> 01:59:05,211
I'm taking a long vacation
when you leave here.

926
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:08,880
I couldn't help it.

927
01:59:08,958 --> 01:59:12,655
Englebert's an important man.
There was nobody else, I had to send you.

928
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:14,196
I understand.

929
01:59:14,464 --> 01:59:18,423
I wish I could keep you here.
As much for your sake as for mine.

930
01:59:20,571 --> 01:59:23,676
Supposing they keep you
indefinitely in Belgium?

931
01:59:24,589 --> 01:59:27,653
You seem so sure
of your religious strength, but I'm not.

932
01:59:27,729 --> 01:59:31,893
Once you set foot in the Mother House,
the walls, the discipline, the silence--

933
01:59:31,967 --> 01:59:34,435
Will you indicate the dosage
for the sedatives?

934
01:59:34,503 --> 01:59:37,939
But if they keep you indefinitely,
will the strength be enough?

935
01:59:38,006 --> 01:59:39,098
Yes.

936
01:59:39,775 --> 01:59:42,437
You're sure it's not
that ferocious will of yours?

937
01:59:42,511 --> 01:59:43,739
I'm sure.

938
01:59:43,812 --> 01:59:46,478
But when you get there,
you're going to wish that you--

939
01:59:46,552 --> 01:59:49,795
Doctor, a nun is not a person
who wishes or desires.

940
01:59:49,867 --> 01:59:51,861
But you're going to feel that you can't....

941
01:59:51,939 --> 01:59:55,170
When you're ready to discuss the case,
please ring for me.

942
02:00:15,013 --> 02:00:17,610
I'm coming back, you beautiful thing.

943
02:00:19,320 --> 02:00:21,447
Do you hear me? I'm coming back.

944
02:01:05,771 --> 02:01:07,500
Come in, Mama Luke.

945
02:01:12,077 --> 02:01:13,669
This is for you.

946
02:01:21,987 --> 02:01:23,750
Tell them thank you.

947
02:03:27,408 --> 02:03:31,508
-How is your health, my child?
-Very good, thank you, Reverend Mother.

948
02:03:31,583 --> 02:03:34,220
So many fine letters
from colonial families...

949
02:03:34,295 --> 02:03:37,031
and missionary fathers
about your good work.

950
02:03:37,104 --> 02:03:39,766
You were liked and respected
by everyone out there...

951
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:42,274
including your native boys, I see.

952
02:03:42,943 --> 02:03:45,776
Do you wish me to give it to your father?

953
02:03:47,314 --> 02:03:50,875
I would rather it be kept in
the congregation to which it belongs.

954
02:03:50,951 --> 02:03:52,748
When I return to....

955
02:03:53,353 --> 02:03:56,417
When I leave here, it will be good to know
it is in the Mother House.

956
02:03:56,494 --> 02:03:58,731
That is very generous of you.

957
02:03:59,072 --> 02:04:03,208
You will be a splendid example
for our postulants and novices here.

958
02:04:03,549 --> 02:04:06,450
And I think they will be good for you, too.

959
02:04:06,619 --> 02:04:10,487
The more we are looked to for example,
the better examples we become.

960
02:04:10,556 --> 02:04:13,992
-Don't you find that true?
-Yes, Reverend Mother.

961
02:04:14,060 --> 02:04:16,655
So, you will stay here with us then.

962
02:04:17,264 --> 02:04:19,323
Now, you must have a good rest.

963
02:04:19,399 --> 02:04:21,530
You must not worry about anything.

964
02:04:21,606 --> 02:04:24,311
Simply enjoy being home again.

965
02:04:24,887 --> 02:04:27,086
Couldn't I help at the hospital,
Reverend Mother?

966
02:04:27,159 --> 02:04:29,457
No, my child, not now.

967
02:04:29,862 --> 02:04:33,696
You must have a few quiet months
to renew your spiritual life.

968
02:04:37,303 --> 02:04:39,999
This will look very nice in our museum.

969
02:04:54,239 --> 02:04:55,365
Gaby.

970
02:05:01,413 --> 02:05:03,176
You look thin, Gaby.

971
02:05:05,183 --> 02:05:08,277
-You always say that, Father.
-It's always true.

972
02:05:09,521 --> 02:05:10,990
No, it isn't.

973
02:05:12,263 --> 02:05:13,667
Of course...

974
02:05:14,071 --> 02:05:17,912
I don't believe that rubbish about
your having had TB in the Congo.

975
02:05:17,982 --> 02:05:19,779
Don't believe it then.

976
02:05:19,850 --> 02:05:23,342
One just doesn't survive
and have TB in the tropics.

977
02:05:23,754 --> 02:05:25,085
Here I am.

978
02:05:28,192 --> 02:05:30,422
You must've had a good doctor.

979
02:05:30,694 --> 02:05:32,093
Exceptional.

980
02:05:37,877 --> 02:05:41,517
I suppose they'll be sending you back
after a little rest?

981
02:05:42,292 --> 02:05:43,589
I don't know.

982
02:05:43,660 --> 02:05:45,457
If there's not a war.

983
02:05:45,963 --> 02:05:48,796
They talked about nothing else
on the boat.

984
02:05:50,567 --> 02:05:52,660
Your brother's in the army.

985
02:05:52,870 --> 02:05:55,395
-Little Pierre?
-Oh, it's big Pierre.

986
02:05:56,073 --> 02:05:58,974
Your sisters?husbands
are in the army, too.

987
02:05:59,043 --> 02:06:02,246
Marie and Louise
will come to see you soon.

988
02:06:04,161 --> 02:06:05,964
There can't be a war.

989
02:06:09,405 --> 02:06:11,430
How are you, really, Gaby?

990
02:06:12,708 --> 02:06:16,007
I'm very well, Father.
Would you like to see the x-rays?

991
02:06:16,079 --> 02:06:17,603
I mean in here.

992
02:06:19,348 --> 02:06:21,145
How are you in there?

993
02:06:21,651 --> 02:06:23,676
Still very lonely for you.

994
02:06:26,694 --> 02:06:30,666
You know, Jean never married.

995
02:06:32,347 --> 02:06:34,941
Father, you're an incurable romantic.

996
02:06:35,050 --> 02:06:37,484
Jean isn't in my thoughts anymore.

997
02:06:43,058 --> 02:06:46,391
I finally had to take a hand
in training your successor...

998
02:06:46,461 --> 02:06:48,656
but she'll never replace you.

999
02:06:49,064 --> 02:06:51,194
She has no rebellion in her.

1000
02:06:51,570 --> 02:06:53,510
That girl was born to be a nun...

1001
02:06:53,579 --> 02:06:57,648
something you could never be
in a thousand years, Reverend Sister.

1002
02:06:57,992 --> 02:07:01,052
You're not in love with him,
are you, my child?

1003
02:07:01,762 --> 02:07:05,220
No, Mother, of course
I've not fallen in love with him.

1004
02:07:05,299 --> 02:07:08,029
I admire him deeply
for his skill and selflessness...

1005
02:07:08,102 --> 02:07:10,502
when there is a life to be saved.

1006
02:07:10,838 --> 02:07:12,931
I think always he's very close to God...

1007
02:07:13,007 --> 02:07:15,807
in those unearthly hours
when he operates.

1008
02:07:27,073 --> 02:07:30,907
Dear Lord,
help me to detach from these memories.

1009
02:07:31,578 --> 02:07:35,639
How can I be a good nun
if I cannot get the Congo out of my blood?

1010
02:07:41,324 --> 02:07:44,668
Suppose you're detained
in the Mother House indefinitely?

1011
02:07:44,738 --> 02:07:47,177
Will your strength be enough then?

1012
02:08:00,592 --> 02:08:03,720
Ordinarily, I would advise you
to go on a retreat...

1013
02:08:03,795 --> 02:08:06,323
to try to regain your inner silence.

1014
02:08:07,138 --> 02:08:09,945
I have done nothing
but pray and meditate.

1015
02:08:10,552 --> 02:08:14,991
Many years ago, I came back from
the missions to the quiet of this house.

1016
02:08:15,860 --> 02:08:17,987
I know what you are feeling.

1017
02:08:18,562 --> 02:08:21,360
There can be no comparison,
Reverend Mother.

1018
02:08:21,432 --> 02:08:24,833
I've been remembering you especially
in my prayers...

1019
02:08:25,236 --> 02:08:28,138
knowing the agony
you've been going through.

1020
02:08:28,774 --> 02:08:32,410
For weeks, each tap on my door,
I thought it would be you.

1021
02:08:35,196 --> 02:08:38,999
I know it would have been the greater
perfection to have stayed here quietly.

1022
02:08:39,070 --> 02:08:41,595
And the greater danger in your case.

1023
02:08:43,074 --> 02:08:46,601
I can't send you back to the Congo
with the talk of war.

1024
02:08:51,916 --> 02:08:55,580
But there is an important post
as Assistant in Surgery...

1025
02:08:55,654 --> 02:08:58,325
at our hospital on the Holland border.

1026
02:08:58,399 --> 02:09:00,499
Thank you, Reverend Mother.

1027
02:09:17,794 --> 02:09:22,203
I have just received a telephone call
from our Reverend Mother Emmanuel.

1028
02:09:22,907 --> 02:09:25,612
"At 3:00 a.m. Rotterdam was bombarded...

1029
02:09:26,388 --> 02:09:28,288
"many thousands killed.

1030
02:09:29,124 --> 02:09:31,456
"Belgium was bombarded at 5:00.

1031
02:09:32,895 --> 02:09:35,762
"The country's system of sluices
had been put into operation...

1032
02:09:35,831 --> 02:09:40,495
"and certain main roads are already blown
up to prevent the German advances."

1033
02:09:42,070 --> 02:09:44,903
I tell you this
only that you will be prepared.

1034
02:09:44,973 --> 02:09:48,042
Our work must go on
as if nothing has happened.

1035
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:52,824
It will be your responsibility
to set the example of courage and calm.

1036
02:09:53,535 --> 02:09:57,437
And to retain in your hearts
the spirit of charity for all.

1037
02:09:58,106 --> 02:10:00,438
Even the enemies of our country.

1038
02:10:32,927 --> 02:10:35,796
"Brussels fell to the enemy today.

1039
02:10:36,869 --> 02:10:39,402
"All of Holland is in German hands.

1040
02:10:41,020 --> 02:10:43,285
"The Maginot Line has fallen...

1041
02:10:43,590 --> 02:10:46,150
"and Northern France has been occupied."

1042
02:10:50,730 --> 02:10:53,665
"The Belgian Army,
the British Expeditionary Forces...

1043
02:10:53,733 --> 02:10:55,633
"and the Ninth French Army...

1044
02:10:55,702 --> 02:10:58,330
"are fighting with their
backs to the sea at Dunkirk."

1045
02:11:05,227 --> 02:11:07,755
King Leopold has signed a surrender.

1046
02:11:08,667 --> 02:11:12,501
He asks the population to behave
with dignity and discipline.

1047
02:11:13,272 --> 02:11:16,105
The sisters are urged not to take sides...

1048
02:11:16,442 --> 02:11:20,936
and not to participate in any activity
against the forces of occupation...

1049
02:11:21,313 --> 02:11:24,908
so that the orderly life
of the community is not disturbed...

1050
02:11:24,984 --> 02:11:28,624
and so that our hospital work
may go on without confusion.

1051
02:11:54,110 --> 02:11:56,984
I can only say again, monsieur,
that Mademoiselle Lisa...

1052
02:11:57,054 --> 02:11:59,955
cannot accept telephone calls
while on duty.

1053
02:12:05,595 --> 02:12:08,564
All right, Father, just a moment.

1054
02:12:24,867 --> 02:12:27,301
Someone who says he's Father John.

1055
02:12:46,074 --> 02:12:49,567
Sister Luke, may I have permission
to go into town for an hour?

1056
02:12:49,645 --> 02:12:51,272
My uncle is sick.

1057
02:13:10,716 --> 02:13:14,347
Now, Lisa, you've used that
"sick uncle" excuse twice in the last week.

1058
02:13:14,422 --> 02:13:15,889
-Have I?
-Yes.

1059
02:13:16,091 --> 02:13:19,026
-I have to go, Sister.
-Then tell me why.

1060
02:13:19,094 --> 02:13:21,028
You say you want to become a nun.

1061
02:13:21,096 --> 02:13:24,725
Well, one of the first things to learn
is obedience to....

1062
02:13:30,707 --> 02:13:34,781
We are hiding our soldiers who escaped.
We're hoping to get them to England.

1063
02:13:35,025 --> 02:13:37,429
-The underground--
-That's enough.

1064
02:13:37,598 --> 02:13:40,658
-Your brother may be one of the boys--
-Please.

1065
02:13:43,137 --> 02:13:44,604
I have to go.

1066
02:13:50,778 --> 02:13:52,268
Please, may I?

1067
02:13:52,780 --> 02:13:55,214
If ever I can be of help, tell me.

1068
02:13:56,521 --> 02:13:57,685
Hurry.

1069
02:14:02,576 --> 02:14:04,806
Did you mean that, about help?

1070
02:14:16,990 --> 02:14:19,925
Dear Lord, forgive me,
I cannot obey anymore.

1071
02:14:20,629 --> 02:14:23,836
What I do from now on
is between You and me alone.

1072
02:14:41,567 --> 02:14:44,161
I have a letter for you, Sister Luke.

1073
02:14:46,443 --> 02:14:48,714
Then I'll have to show it
to Mother Superior.

1074
02:14:48,786 --> 02:14:49,950
Don't.

1075
02:16:17,873 --> 02:16:20,137
If such a death happened with us,
Mama Luke...

1076
02:16:20,209 --> 02:16:24,077
we'd tie the murderer to a stake
and cut his body for fish bait.

1077
02:16:24,146 --> 02:16:27,317
But we would not.
We have been taught to forgive.

1078
02:16:41,783 --> 02:16:43,148
Oh, Father!

1079
02:17:01,839 --> 02:17:04,569
Father, I no longer belong in a convent.

1080
02:17:06,511 --> 02:17:08,741
Why do you say that, my child?

1081
02:17:08,980 --> 02:17:11,676
I am a hypocrite in the religious life.

1082
02:17:12,283 --> 02:17:15,548
I wear the habit of obedience,
but I flout the Rule.

1083
02:17:17,223 --> 02:17:20,292
I wear the cross of Christ
above a heart filled with hate.

1084
02:17:20,369 --> 02:17:24,177
You must try, my child.
These times are sent to test us.

1085
02:17:25,916 --> 02:17:28,544
I wonder if I'm even a good Christian.

1086
02:17:28,785 --> 02:17:32,152
When I think of my father,
I can't forgive the enemy.

1087
02:17:33,724 --> 02:17:36,158
And this is only one of my faults.

1088
02:17:36,226 --> 02:17:40,060
You must pray to God
to deliver you from revenge in the heart.

1089
02:17:40,397 --> 02:17:42,995
Today, a German war nurse died here...

1090
02:17:43,573 --> 02:17:46,311
and try as I would, I couldn't regret it.

1091
02:17:46,986 --> 02:17:50,516
My whole lifework
has been dedicated to saving lives...

1092
02:17:51,093 --> 02:17:52,958
and I almost rejoiced.

1093
02:17:53,396 --> 02:17:55,626
Perhaps it is too much to ask.

1094
02:17:56,799 --> 02:17:58,994
Father, I don't believe that.

1095
02:17:59,101 --> 02:18:01,126
It is not too much to ask.

1096
02:18:03,239 --> 02:18:05,139
I simply cannot obey...

1097
02:18:05,841 --> 02:18:10,185
-and if I cannot obey, then--
-You're so hard on yourself, my child.

1098
02:18:11,864 --> 02:18:14,927
Father, please lay my case
before the Cardinal.

1099
02:18:17,606 --> 02:18:19,403
I am no longer a nun.

1100
02:18:21,510 --> 02:18:24,240
You solemnly promised
to obey unto death.

1101
02:18:25,848 --> 02:18:29,045
You should seek God's pleasure
and your own joy...

1102
02:18:29,218 --> 02:18:31,550
in keeping faith with your vows.

1103
02:18:32,490 --> 02:18:35,594
Sacrifice is the only test
to thy love of God.

1104
02:18:38,146 --> 02:18:41,081
You will make a novena
to our Blessed Virgin.

1105
02:18:42,250 --> 02:18:44,275
She always works miracles.

1106
02:18:45,053 --> 02:18:46,816
Haven't you noticed?

1107
02:18:53,094 --> 02:18:55,722
All right, Father, because you ask me.

1108
02:19:01,450 --> 02:19:05,221
Reverend Mother Emmanuel
is paying a visit in a week's time.

1109
02:19:06,426 --> 02:19:08,621
Please wait and speak to her.

1110
02:19:09,062 --> 02:19:11,656
I do not want to see Mother Emmanuel.

1111
02:19:12,533 --> 02:19:15,627
Are you afraid
she'll dissuade you from leaving?

1112
02:19:16,069 --> 02:19:17,559
It isn't that.

1113
02:19:18,639 --> 02:19:20,937
Please lay my case before the Cardinal.

1114
02:19:21,008 --> 02:19:23,311
Won't you wait a little longer?

1115
02:19:24,319 --> 02:19:26,316
Father, you must forgive me...

1116
02:19:26,394 --> 02:19:29,232
but if you do not put my case
before the Cardinal...

1117
02:19:29,302 --> 02:19:31,793
I should do something that would kill me.

1118
02:19:31,871 --> 02:19:34,271
I shall leave without permission.

1119
02:19:59,217 --> 02:20:02,015
Why did you make me ask for you,
my child?

1120
02:20:02,254 --> 02:20:05,655
Didn't you know
that I'd been aware of your struggle?

1121
02:20:06,424 --> 02:20:09,120
It is too late for discussions,
Reverend Mother.

1122
02:20:09,194 --> 02:20:11,162
I'm at the end of my struggles.

1123
02:20:11,229 --> 02:20:13,133
Your sisters love you...

1124
02:20:13,202 --> 02:20:15,108
the doctors trust you...

1125
02:20:15,176 --> 02:20:17,914
and your students
respect you enormously.

1126
02:20:19,523 --> 02:20:21,753
You can cheat your sisters...

1127
02:20:22,927 --> 02:20:25,521
but you cannot cheat yourself or God.

1128
02:20:26,130 --> 02:20:30,567
Have you struggled long enough to say
surely that you've come to the end?

1129
02:20:31,702 --> 02:20:35,536
I think I've been struggling all these years,
Reverend Mother.

1130
02:20:36,740 --> 02:20:40,654
In the beginning, each struggle
seemed different from the one before it.

1131
02:20:40,723 --> 02:20:42,754
But then they began to repeat...

1132
02:20:42,864 --> 02:20:46,062
and I saw
they all had the same core: obedience...

1133
02:20:46,536 --> 02:20:48,197
without question...

1134
02:20:48,271 --> 02:20:50,239
without inner murmuring.

1135
02:20:50,840 --> 02:20:53,741
Perfect obedience as Christ practiced it...

1136
02:20:54,277 --> 02:20:56,006
as I no longer can.

1137
02:20:57,180 --> 02:20:58,239
Yes?

1138
02:21:00,150 --> 02:21:03,454
There are times when my conscience asks
which has priority.

1139
02:21:03,525 --> 02:21:05,328
It or the Holy Rule?

1140
02:21:07,073 --> 02:21:09,135
When the bell calls me to chapel...

1141
02:21:09,212 --> 02:21:12,204
I often have to sacrifice
what might be the decisive moment...

1142
02:21:12,281 --> 02:21:14,715
in a spiritual talk with a patient.

1143
02:21:14,784 --> 02:21:18,049
I'm late every day
for chapel or refectory or both.

1144
02:21:18,654 --> 02:21:20,986
When I have night duty,
I break the Grand Silence...

1145
02:21:21,057 --> 02:21:25,721
because I can no longer cut short a talk
with a patient who seems to need me.

1146
02:21:26,964 --> 02:21:30,741
Mother, why must God's helpers
be struck dumb by five bells...

1147
02:21:30,812 --> 02:21:35,051
in the very hours when men in trouble
want to talk about their souls?

1148
02:21:38,093 --> 02:21:42,120
You entered the convent to be a nun,
not to be a nurse.

1149
02:21:42,731 --> 02:21:47,327
The religious life must be more important
to you than your love of medicine.

1150
02:21:51,974 --> 02:21:54,712
Won't you make one more effort for God?

1151
02:21:55,656 --> 02:21:57,960
And for me as His instrument?

1152
02:22:00,067 --> 02:22:02,297
I have tried, Reverend Mother.

1153
02:22:08,209 --> 02:22:11,940
When I go from here,
I shall take you with me in my heart...

1154
02:22:12,713 --> 02:22:15,739
and keep you each day in my prayers.

1155
02:22:55,462 --> 02:22:57,692
-Lisa.
-Sister.

1156
02:22:59,399 --> 02:23:02,596
Lisa, you often talked
about entering the convent.

1157
02:23:02,669 --> 02:23:04,694
Yes, Sister. I'm going to.

1158
02:23:05,872 --> 02:23:09,440
You're not entering because
of any personal feeling of admiration...

1159
02:23:09,516 --> 02:23:11,148
you might have...

1160
02:23:12,160 --> 02:23:14,064
for any of the sisters?

1161
02:23:14,700 --> 02:23:18,067
No, not really. I don't think so.

1162
02:23:20,239 --> 02:23:23,538
I just wanted to know, Lisa,
because I'm going out.

1163
02:23:26,045 --> 02:23:28,036
I felt you were going to.

1164
02:23:29,115 --> 02:23:31,140
I'm glad you're coming in.

1165
02:23:32,486 --> 02:23:34,961
Is it certain that you're leaving?

1166
02:23:35,766 --> 02:23:37,260
I have asked.

1167
02:23:38,677 --> 02:23:40,304
What happens now?

1168
02:23:41,579 --> 02:23:43,103
I have no idea.

1169
02:23:47,452 --> 02:23:49,113
Here's an address.

1170
02:23:50,121 --> 02:23:52,351
The underground needs nurses.

1171
02:23:55,160 --> 02:23:58,497
-We shall miss you.
-And I shall miss....

1172
02:24:04,388 --> 02:24:07,414
You'll be a fine nun, Lisa. Not a failure.

1173
02:24:21,972 --> 02:24:25,748
As a representative of the Archbishop,
I must ask you, Sister Luke...

1174
02:24:25,819 --> 02:24:28,763
if you are doing this of your own free will?

1175
02:24:29,231 --> 02:24:30,289
Yes.

1176
02:24:30,900 --> 02:24:35,303
Sister, have you really considered
the seriousness of what you're doing?

1177
02:24:36,405 --> 02:24:37,463
Yes.

1178
02:24:43,946 --> 02:24:46,881
There are these three papers
to sign, Sister.

1179
02:24:48,320 --> 02:24:50,693
One copy is for you, one is for us...

1180
02:24:50,763 --> 02:24:53,238
and one is for the papal archives.

1181
02:25:03,118 --> 02:25:05,109
Have you somewhere to go?

1182
02:25:09,125 --> 02:25:10,183
Yes.

1183
02:25:12,496 --> 02:25:14,994
Sister, is there nothing we can do?

1184
02:25:17,313 --> 02:25:18,545
Nothing.

1185
02:26:00,347 --> 02:26:02,977
From here
you will go to the portress?room.

1186
02:26:03,052 --> 02:26:05,790
She will give you further instructions.
