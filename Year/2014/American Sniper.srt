1
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,928
It's a fucking hot box.

2
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,002
Man, the fucking dirt here
tastes like dog shit.

3
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,003
Oh, well, you'd know, wouldn't you?

4
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,162
Shut the fuck up.

5
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,686
Breacher up!

6
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,050
I got a military-age male...

7
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,363
...that's on a cell phone,
watching the convoy. Over.

8
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,568
<i>If he's reporting troop movement...</i>

9
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,087
<i>...you have a green light. Your call.
Over.</i>

10
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,211
Maybe he's just calling his old lady. Heh.

11
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,891
He stepped off.

12
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:48,921
Hold on, I got a woman and a kid 200 yards
out, moving towards the convoy.

13
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,281
Her arms aren't swinging.
She's carrying something.

14
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,283
She's got a grenade. She got a RKG Russian
grenade she just handed to the kid.

15
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,121
<i>A woman and a kid?</i>

16
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,840
You got eyes on this?
Can you confirm?

17
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,244
<i>Negative. You know the R.O.E.
Your call.</i>

18
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,609
They fry you if you're wrong.
They send your ass to Leavenworth.

19
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,527
- You got him.
- Heh.

20
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,441
Now get back here.

21
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,841
You don't ever leave
your rifle in the dirt.

22
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,127
Yes, sir.

23
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,529
It was a hell of a shot, son.

24
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,571
You got a gift.

25
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,601
You're gonna make a fine hunter someday.

26
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,845
Here in the Book of Acts...

27
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,209
...several times,
Paul stands in judgment...

28
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,490
...for what he believes.

29
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,210
At times, we all have to do that.

30
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,681
I mean, we don't see with his eyes...

31
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,684
...so we don't know the glory of his plan.

32
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,121
Our lives unfold before us like
puzzling reflections in a mirror.

33
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,043
- What are you doing?
- Shh. Shh.

34
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,120
But on the day we rise,
we will see with clarity...

35
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,129
...and understand the mystery of his ways.

36
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,211
Let us pray.

37
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,567
<i>There are three types
of people in this world.</i>

38
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,485
<i>Sheep, wolves and sheepdogs.</i>

39
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,646
Now, some people prefer to believe
that evil doesn't exist in the world.

40
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,685
And if it ever darkened their doorstep, they
wouldn't know how to protect themselves.

41
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,887
Those are the sheep.

42
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,209
And then you got predators.

43
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,091
<i>They use violence to prey on the weak.</i>

44
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,651
<i>They're the wolves.</i>

45
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,400
Come on, Jeff, punch him.

46
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,643
And then there are those who've been
blessed with the gift of aggression...

47
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,851
<i>...and the overpowering need
to protect the flock.</i>

48
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,205
<i>These men are a rare breed...</i>

49
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,489
...that live to confront the wolf.

50
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,084
They are the sheepdog.

51
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,445
Now, we're not raising any sheep
in this family.

52
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,647
- I will whup your ass if you turn into a wolf.
- Wayne.

53
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,609
But we protect our own.

54
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,122
If someone tries to fight you...

55
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,129
...or tries to bully your little brother,
you have my permission to finish it.

56
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,964
The guy was picking on Jeff.

57
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,686
Is that true?

58
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,963
Yes, sir. Yes, he was.

59
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,404
Did you finish it?

60
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,160
<i>Then you know who you are.</i>

61
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,450
<i>You know your purpose.</i>

62
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,044
<i>Chris Kyle draws the horse
Big Business here this evening.</i>

63
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,761
I'm doing all right.

64
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,321
That's good.

65
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,324
<i>So tonight he needs to beat
the leading score of 86.</i>

66
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,767
<i>The louder you cheer,
the longer he'll ride!</i>

67
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,688
Come on! Yeah!

68
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,649
<i>I don't think... He'll walk it off.</i>

69
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,760
Jeff, looks like your brother did it again!

70
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,848
<i>All right, ladies and gentlemen,
Chris Kyle!</i>

71
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,290
Man, wasn't nobody there,
and you come out with a belt buckle.

72
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,444
- What are you supposed to with it?
- Supposed to get laid with it.

73
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,523
I'll wear it,
see if it puts Sarah in the mood.

74
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,489
Shit, a strong wind'll put Sarah
in the mood.

75
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,960
- Is that what they say?
- You know what they called her...

76
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,326
...in high school
- Don't say it.

77
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,005
- Sarah Sucks-a-Lotta...
- What I say?!

78
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,207
Shit, Chris.

79
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,521
Goddamn it.

80
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,842
Oh, buckle bunny, those are two girls.

81
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,721
No, he kept looking... He had his eyes
on her, and that's why the last time...

82
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,167
Wait till you see what this does.

83
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,725
Let's see him go!

84
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,963
Baby, who wants
to fuck a rodeo sta...? What the fuck?!

85
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,128
You said you wasn't coming home
until tomorrow.

86
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,250
- I said what?
- Leave him alone. He didn't do anything!

87
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,244
- Easy! I didn't know shit, man.
- Come out here!

88
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,485
Chris, leave him alone! Fucking Chris,
leave him alone! Goddamn it!

89
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,166
- He didn't know, all right?!
- Oh, he didn't know.

90
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,721
- What didn't you know?
- I didn't know. Just give me my hat.

91
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,564
- He didn't know.
- Get his hat, babe.

92
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,849
Whose rifles did you think those were?
Them men's clothes were hers?

93
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,650
You didn't know,
you fucking son of bitch?

94
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,724
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You don't have to fucking punch everyone!

95
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,565
Put that fucking hat on
and get the fuck out.

96
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,768
What the fuck is wrong with you?

97
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,446
- Get out.
- You know what...

98
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,443
...I don't know
what you expect from me.

99
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,446
You just drag me out here and then you run
off with your brother every damn weekend.

100
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,568
Why do you think I did this, huh?

101
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,924
I do this to get attention,
don't you get that?

102
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,044
Get your stuff and get out.

103
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,767
Fine. You know what? Fuck you. Fine.

104
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,447
You think you're a cowboy
because you rodeo.

105
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,651
You're not a cowboy.
You're just a lousy ranch hand.

106
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,883
And you're a shitty fucking lay!

107
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,566
Don't say it.

108
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,447
When's the wedding?

109
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,130
I understand what you're saying...

110
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,165
...but, you know,
we get to travel over the whole state.

111
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,007
Different city every weekend.

112
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,325
Broncs and steers.

113
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,563
I don't know, maybe she's right, though.

114
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,801
"She's right"?

115
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,288
Right about what, Chris?

116
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,684
She's not right, man.
We're cowboys, we're living the dream.

117
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,280
<i>This is a special report.</i>

118
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,324
<i>Those explosions
set to go off at the U.S. embassies...</i>

119
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,290
...in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania
and Nairobi, Kenya...

120
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,768
<i>...were clearly a part of someone's war
against the United States.</i>

121
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,967
<i>More than 80 dead...</i>

122
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,363
<i>...more than 1700 injured
in two bomb blasts today...</i>

123
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,931
Hey, Jeff. Jeff.

124
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,128
<i>...which exploded just minutes
and 450 miles apart.</i>

125
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,367
Look at this.

126
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,526
<i>It is still unclear who our enemy is. Although
the embassies were obviously the targets...</i>

127
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,011
Look what they did to us.

128
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,686
<i>...most of the dead and injured
are not Americans.</i>

129
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,165
<i>Still, eight Americans, including one child,
are dead and five are still missing.</i>

130
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,761
- So you're from Texas.
- Yes, sir.

131
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,729
- And you're a patriot.
- Yes, sir.

132
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,565
And you're pissed off.

133
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,131
I'm looking to be of service.

134
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,850
- Do you like to fight?
- Yes, sir.

135
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,644
You like to fight. Okay, well,
I want you to meet the warrior elite.

136
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,207
SEALs.

137
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,731
Yup. Sea, Air and Land.

138
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,689
Well, I'm not much for the water, sir.

139
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,842
No? Well, this ain't for the faint-a-heart.

140
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,650
Most men, they wash out, they quit.

141
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,087
Well, I'm not most men, sir. I don't quit.

142
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,567
- This is where the fun stops!
- Take it, girls.

143
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,529
It's gonna get harder from here on out.

144
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,923
That's it. Take it. Take it.
Only hurts the first time.

145
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,570
What we got here?
You a quitter, boy?

146
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,120
- Hooyah, no, Instructor Rolle.
- Bullshit! Your ass is fleet meat...

147
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,247
...if I ever did see it!

148
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,762
Don't turn away from me, son.
You look at me and you take this shit.

149
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,046
Hooyah. yes!

150
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,841
You old as fuck! You join the Navy because you
had such a good goddamn time on Noah's ark?

151
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,047
How old are you, boy?

152
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,929
- Hooyah, 30!
- 30?!

153
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,765
Your fart dust could've fathered
half these boys!

154
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,968
We gonna weed through the quitters.

155
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,851
Yeah, we gonna find us
a goddamn warrior or two today.

156
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,923
Dauber, you sure you from Connecticut?

157
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,606
I ain't never met no hick
from Hartford before.

158
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,047
Hooyah, Instructor Friday.
Country's countrywide.

159
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,690
I came here to kill terrorists.

160
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,684
Who the fuck told your ass to giggle?

161
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,362
Hooyah, no one, Instructor Rolle!

162
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,683
- Did I ask you to open up your mouth?
- Hooyah, no, Instructor Rolle.

163
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,451
Look at your fat, pasty, giggly ass.

164
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,965
Damn, son.

165
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,090
You a big Dr. Pepper,
Cheeto-eating motherfucker!

166
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,641
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.

167
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,122
Biggles! That's your name
from now on, sunshine.

168
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,486
And that's your ticket home.

169
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,240
"D"! What are you still doing in my
line trying to make this team?

170
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,129
Everybody knows black guys don't swim.

171
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,129
It's all right, sir.
I'm not black!

172
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,129
- No?
- No, I'm the new black.

173
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,563
We run slow, we jump low, we swim good
and we shop at Gap.

174
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,326
And I make the white folk proud
when I hose down their ladies.

175
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,806
I dick them down!

176
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,651
Chicken!

177
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,651
There it is.

178
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,609
That is a quitter.

179
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,483
You say goodbye, I say good riddance.

180
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,769
He quits on you here,
he gonna quit in the field of battle.

181
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,131
When shit gets hairy, he won't step up.
Your ass gets shot, he won't pull you out.

182
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,169
- Six.
- I'm looking for warriors!

183
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,924
- Seven.
- Keep counting!

184
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,645
- Eight!
- I can't hear you!

185
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,847
Nine!

186
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,368
Want me to call your mama?
Maybe she can come and take your place!

187
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,010
This is foreplay!

188
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,642
I'm about to turn on some Marvin Gaye
and get in that ass!

189
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,370
That's what I'm talking about!

190
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,364
Squirrel, Squirrel, Squirrel,
where the fuck are your nuts?

191
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,843
Oh, they're gone for good, sir.
They crawled back up inside.

192
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,530
But they are warm!

193
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,689
Big talk from a little man!

194
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,001
Now, you.

195
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,684
How about you, old man? Huh?

196
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,166
How you feeling?

197
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,364
Hooyah! Dangerous. Feeling dangerous.

198
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,725
Hooyah! Kyle's feeling dangerous!

199
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,206
Move!

200
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,971
Take seats!

201
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,483
Yeah! 56 degrees! So fresh, so clean!

202
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,685
- Here she comes!
- Mother Nature's got something for you!

203
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,889
Only a few more hours
and you're Navy SEALs!

204
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,560
<i>Grease gun, dive knife by my side</i>

205
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,405
<i>These are the tools that'll make a man die</i>

206
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,404
<i>These are the tools that'll make a man die</i>

207
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,130
I'm the only one who's hit one, so...

208
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,481
Boom!

209
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,410
Oh, yeah! Chris, your turn, man.

210
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,523
- You got one more.
- I got one more? All right.

211
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,324
All right. One more. Here we go.

212
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,564
Hey, we want a smaller target
we'll use your arm, man.

213
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,445
Hello.

214
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,721
Hi.

215
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,680
How you doing?

216
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,765
Good. Thank you.

217
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,089
Can I get you a drink?

218
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,287
Will a drink make you
six inches taller and charming?

219
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,930
Will it make you not married?

220
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,601
I'm not ma...

221
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,127
Yeah, I just watched you
take your ring off, okay?

222
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,647
Don't be a scumbag. Go home.

223
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,931
Oh, my God.

224
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,404
It may have been the leather pants.

225
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,365
Oh, yeah?

226
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,409
What kind of pants does a girl
have to wear to be left alone?

227
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,125
Well, maybe corduroy.

228
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,808
I mean, is that how it is with you guys?
You're suddenly single after three beers?

229
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,731
Oh, no, after three beers
all I know is to get a fourth.

230
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,641
That's great. That's great.

231
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,926
Real redneck.

232
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,202
- Oh, I'm not a redneck, I'm from Texas.
- Mm.

233
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,170
What's the difference?

234
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,560
Well, we ride horses...

235
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,210
...and they ride their cousins.

236
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,082
What do you do for work?
You're obviously military.

237
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,322
Oh, uh, I polish dolphins.
They're in captivity.

238
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,640
What I do is just sort of scrape off
the crustaceans...

239
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,404
Do I look stupid to you?

240
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,968
No, honestly, you look a little sad.

241
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,248
Am I tall enough to buy you a drink?

242
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,129
Not until you tell me what you do.

243
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,681
Okay, how about this. Hey, Greg?
Get two shots?

244
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,360
How about we do a shot for a question.

245
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,807
Every time you ask me a question
that I answer, do a shot.

246
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,371
- Same, vice versa.
- Game on.

247
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,845
You can leave the bottle too.

248
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,445
Okay, shoot.

249
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,204
All right. Ahem.

250
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,328
You're obviously military.
What branch?

251
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,960
I just finished BUD/S,
heading to sniper school.

252
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,130
Are you kidding me? You're a SEAL?

253
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,520
Yes, ma'am.

254
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,210
That's two questions.

255
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,169
- Shit.
- Ha, ha.

256
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,367
Really?

257
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,207
Oh, I didn't really mean
you had to do that. Heh.

258
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,444
Okay. Shit.

259
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,530
I know all about you guys.
My sister was engaged to a SEAL.

260
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,121
- Oh, was she?
- Yeah.

261
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,566
- Mm.
- Mm-hm.

262
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,200
Hold on, how you know all about us?
What do you mean?

263
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,882
What I mean is, you're a bunch
of arrogant, self-centered pricks...

264
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,884
...who think you can lie and cheat
and do whatever the fuck you want.

265
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,280
I'd never date a SEAL.

266
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,769
Wait, why would you say I'm self-centered?
I'd lay down my life for my country.

267
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,247
Why?

268
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,563
It's the greatest country on Earth.
I'd do everything I can to protect it.

269
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,684
Look, I'm sorry what happened
to your sister, but that's not me.

270
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,925
It's nice to meet you.

271
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,640
Where you going?

272
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,730
Just gonna go home because
you said you wouldn't date a SEAL, so...

273
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,048
I said I'd never marry one.

274
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,322
Oh. Okay. Well, then, maybe, hello.
Nice to meet you.

275
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,324
- What's your name?
- Taya.

276
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,567
Taya.

277
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,843
Chris. I'm Chris Kyle.
Nice to meet you.

278
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,081
Pleasure.

279
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,044
I mean, it's pretty egotistical of you to
think you can protect us all. Isn't it, Chris?

280
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,608
Well, our BUD/S office commander said
that it's three...

281
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,081
Okay.

282
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,881
He said there's three things we gotta
worry about: ego, booze and women.

283
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,206
Well...

284
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,283
...it sounds like you're under attack.

285
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,446
You're pretty.

286
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,044
You're so beautiful.

287
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,127
Hey. I got you.

288
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,600
I'm not going home with you,
so don't even think about it.

289
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,406
Feel breath filling every
cell in your body.

290
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,206
This is our ritual.

291
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,281
We master our breath,
we master our mind.

292
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,124
Pulling the trigger
will become an unconscious effort.

293
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,965
You will be aware of it,
but not directing it.

294
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,888
And as you exhale,
find your natural respiratory pause...

295
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,088
...and the space between heartbeats.

296
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,211
<i>Hey, this is Taya.
I can't get to the phone.</i>

297
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,966
<i>- Leave a message. I'll call you back.
- Hey, it's me again.</i>

298
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,929
<i>That guy whose shoes you puked on.</i>

299
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,050
<i>So, yeah, I was thinking maybe
you didn't get that last message?</i>

300
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,851
<i>The last message I left
or the one before that?</i>

301
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,241
<i>- So I figured that...</i>
- You figured what?

302
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,801
<i>Hey. How are you? How you been?</i>

303
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,887
Good.

304
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,522
<i>Good. Wow, what are you up to?</i>

305
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,242
Not a lot. You?

306
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,560
<i>No, just excited to talk to you.</i>

307
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,691
Aim small, miss small.

308
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,366
If you aim for a shirt button,
you might miss by two inches.

309
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,570
If you aim for a shirt,
you might miss by two feet.

310
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,364
You better close those groupings, Kyle.

311
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,567
Yes, sir.

312
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,006
Come on. Whoo!

313
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,207
Not bad.

314
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,044
- What do we get for that?
- Top shelf.

315
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,850
I like that one. The brown one.

316
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,161
- Here you go.
- Great.

317
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,288
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir. Have a good day.

318
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,527
Hello.

319
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,648
Good. That looks good on you.

320
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,689
So did you always want to be a soldier?

321
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,163
Oh. Uh, no, I wanted to be a cowboy, but...

322
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,130
I don't know. I did that.
I thought I was meant for something more.

323
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,726
So you started rescuing girls from bars?

324
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,360
- I think I rescued that bar from you.
- Ha, ha.

325
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,685
You like country music?

326
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,931
Only when I'm depressed.

327
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,929
How about kids. You want kids?

328
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,127
Yeah, someday.

329
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,290
My mom says I have a nose
for picking the wrong men.

330
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,527
Well, that's a shitty
thing to say to a girl.

331
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,011
Well, I've proven her right.

332
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,082
Them wrong picks put you here...

333
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,484
...made you who you are.

334
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,490
I like who you are.

335
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,802
You ever think about what happens when there's
a real person on the end of that gun?

336
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,729
I don't know. I just hope
I can do my job when that day comes.

337
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,369
Are we looking at the same target?

338
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,005
You're spitting dust.

339
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,682
And don't worry. We can always use
corpsmen for the guys who can't shoot.

340
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,886
Oh, fuck.

341
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,160
You're trembling.

342
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,526
I know it.

343
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,480
- We don't have to do this.
- No, I want to. I do.

344
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,086
- Yeah?
- You just feel real and it scares me.

345
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,124
You got your off-eye shut?

346
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,080
Well, if I close my off-eye
then I can't see what's out there.

347
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,370
- There's nothing out there but the target.
- Negative, sir. There is something out there.

348
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,567
Punch it.

349
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,331
Will pushups help?

350
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,323
Give me 50, Kyle. Clear and safe.

351
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,410
I'm better when it's breathing.

352
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,731
Oh, my God. Chris.

353
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,211
- What's wrong?
- No!

354
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,766
<i>Here's the tape.</i>

355
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,764
<i>You see the first plane coming in
from what looks like the east side.</i>

356
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,809
<i>And it goes into the building
with the flames...</i>

357
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,803
<i>...and the smoke billowing out
the other side of the tower.</i>

358
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,409
<i>It's hard for me to tell exactly which is
the north side and which is the south side.</i>

359
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,609
<i>It appears it's coming out
of the north side.</i>

360
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,684
<i>And then, moments ago,
these incredible images.</i>

361
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,410
<i>I believe that's the first one.</i>

362
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,961
<i>That's the south tower collapsing.</i>

363
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,288
<i>It almost looks like one of those
implosions of buildings that you see...</i>

364
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,480
<i>...except there is nothing controlled
about this. This is devastation.</i>

365
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,605
You hardly even know me.

366
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,650
I know enough.
You are a package deal, babe.

367
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,049
What are you so afraid of?

368
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,361
Nothing.

369
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,805
Everything, I don't know.

370
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,803
What if it doesn't work out?

371
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,604
We're gonna get married
and then we're gonna start a family.

372
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,646
You got it all planned out, don't you?

373
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,966
I'm done.

374
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,326
I love you.

375
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,280
You're gonna need a ring if you
wanna talk all tough like that.

376
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,487
Okay.

377
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,444
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. and Mrs. Chris Kyle!

378
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,169
- What the hell is on your neck?
- Hm?

379
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,527
Your neck. You got, like,
green paint all over you.

380
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,682
Would you believe me, babe,
if I told you...

381
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,650
...that I had an IV and I was
all green about two hours ago?

382
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,165
What?

383
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,045
It's a package deal, babe.

384
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,326
Oh, my God.

385
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,527
Come here, you.

386
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,566
Cheers to that.

387
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,531
What's the word, chief?

388
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,123
Just got the call, boys.

389
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,406
It's on!

390
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,364
Hooyah! Ha-ha-ha.

391
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,960
Shots!

392
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,404
Yeah! Whoo!

393
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,729
- Only six weeks, baby.
- I'm so afraid, baby.

394
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,281
That's what they say.
You got nothing to be afraid of.

395
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,090
It's all part of the plan.

396
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,040
Your heart is beating out of your chest.

397
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,722
That's just because I'm not the only
one who's going to war, that's all.

398
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,120
Welcome to Fallujah.
The new Wild West of the old Middle East.

399
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,086
AQl put a price on your heads, and now
extremists from around the globe...

400
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,362
...are flooding the
borders to collect on it.

401
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,320
You snipers, you're gonna be paired
with a Marine to watch your back...

402
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,441
...and inserted along the main road to do
overwatch for 1st Marines going door to door.

403
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,281
Your job is to protect those Marines
at all costs.

404
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,522
The city has been evacuated.

405
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,490
Any military-age male
who is still here...

406
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,011
...is here to kill you.

407
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,288
Let's bring these boys in safe
and get our asses back home.

408
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,684
Out of my truck! Out, out, out!

409
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,161
I'd keep that head down, Tex.

410
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,444
Muj got snipers, too, you know.

411
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,243
A sniper won't aim for your head.

412
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,650
Man, they got this one sniper that's been
hitting headshots from 500 yards out.

413
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,087
They call him Mustafa.

414
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,769
He's in the Olympics.

415
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,402
They got sniping in the Olympics now?

416
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,720
Hold on, I got a woman and a kid,
200 yards out, moving towards the convoy.

417
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:53,126
Her arms aren't swinging.
She's carrying something.

418
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,083
She's got a grenade. She got a RKG
Russian grenade she just handed to the kid.

419
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,965
<i>You say a woman and a kid?</i>

420
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,685
You got eyes on this? Can you confirm?

421
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,447
<i>Negative. You know the R.O.E. Your call.</i>

422
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,526
Man, they fry you if you're wrong.
They send your ass to Leavenworth.

423
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,683
Fuck, that was gnarly.

424
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,728
Fucking evil bitch.

425
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,721
<i>- Nice shooting. Hell of a call.
- Roger. Good looking out, Navy.</i>

426
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,646
- Fuck, you hear that, man?
- Get the fuck off me.

427
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,967
- Where is everybody?
- We're just picking our dicks.

428
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,806
- We're training those fucking Haji soldiers.
- Hey, why aren't you out there?

429
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,291
Well, I have the shits.

430
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,487
What...

431
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,971
...from reading a comic book?

432
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,242
It's a fucking graphic novel, man.

433
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,447
It's a big difference.

434
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,844
I heard you were on fucking fire out there.

435
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,480
Marc Lee came in,
said you popped your cherry.

436
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,051
Is that right?

437
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,682
There was a kid
who barely had any hair on his balls.

438
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,763
Mother gives him a grenade.

439
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,562
Sends him out there to kill Marines.

440
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,846
Dude, that was evil like
I never seen before.

441
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,770
Yeah, but, hey, man...

442
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,447
...you know that kid could've taken out,
like, ten fucking Marines, right?

443
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,841
- Yeah, but I killed him.
- You did your job.

444
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,525
That's the end of the story.

445
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,605
Yeah, it's just not how I envisioned
that first one to go down.

446
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,843
- Oh!
- Fuck, man.

447
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,126
What the hell?

448
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,167
That was your overwatch, Einstein.

449
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,925
You can thank him later.

450
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,400
Let's move!

451
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,891
Keep it going.

452
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,769
- Keep it going.
- Hurry up.

453
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,204
Contact! Front disperse!

454
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,371
Cease fire!

455
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,687
Whoa.

456
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,361
Eyes on the rooftop.
Keep your eyes up there.

457
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,721
Breacher up!

458
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,091
<i>Man down! Man down!
We need a corpsman over here now.</i>

459
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,651
<i>Enemy sniper located.</i>

460
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:56,203
<i>Approximate grid:
Quebec-Romeo-155604.</i>

461
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,971
Smells like piss in here.

462
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,167
Yeah, well...

463
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,926
You covered our asses out there,
man. Some ballsy shots.

464
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,082
Uhn. Fuck. They were clean, right?

465
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,446
Hell, yeah, they were.

466
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,281
Fucking sniper went right up our ass.

467
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,886
I already chewed out security detail.
Won't happen again.

468
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,485
It better not happen again.

469
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,728
There's a hot spot 400 meters out.

470
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,689
I'm gonna go write up
some shooter statements.

471
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,966
How many did you get?

472
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,442
I got six...
Well, that's not true. I got eight...

473
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,645
...but they dragged two off.

474
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,040
You got six?

475
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,680
- Yeah, why? What's wrong?
- Nothing.

476
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,848
You got more
than the rest of the snipers combined.

477
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,490
Yeah, but they got one of us.

478
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,404
You can't shoot what you can't see.

479
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,641
His wife said he was carrying a Koran.

480
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,962
Look, I don't know what
a Koran looks like...

481
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,122
...but I can tell you what he was carrying.

482
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,727
It was pressed metal, shot 7.62s,
and it looked just like an AK-47.

483
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,845
So you tell me what he was carrying.

484
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,045
Oh, here he comes.

485
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:11,090
Ladies and genitals, listen up!
We have a legend in our midst.

486
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,561
Round of applause for the legend.

487
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,924
There we go. We're so proud of you
back home on the range, boy.

488
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,811
Now, it's been said that the legend here...

489
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,691
...can kill 100 men with one blow.

490
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,161
Or, no, it was... No, fuck, what was it?

491
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,005
It was one blow from a single man.

492
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,083
He blew 100 men.

493
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,720
And he's single.

494
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,967
And so...

495
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,167
Goddamn it! Shit!

496
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,881
Oh, shit!

497
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,605
Damn, man!

498
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,165
You want a food fight?

499
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,129
Come on. Shit.

500
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,089
Only way to shut you up.

501
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,760
<i>Have you killed anyone yet?</i>

502
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,166
That is not the way the call home
is supposed to go, babe.

503
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,170
Don't be weird with me.

504
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,486
Seriously.

505
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,530
I want you to tell me everything.

506
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,683
Well, there's certain things
you just can't say over the phone.

507
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,605
Okay, you knocked me up, right?

508
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,843
And I'm sitting here by myself,
literally assembling baby cribs...

509
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,530
...and you can't talk to me?

510
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,610
That's your big plan?

511
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,927
<i>You guys almost done over there, yet?</i>

512
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,321
I can't stop thinking about that little
pink number you wore on our honeymoon.

513
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,485
Yeah, it's called a nightgown.

514
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,927
<i>Yeah.</i>

515
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,162
And three days?

516
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,085
Three days is not a honeymoon.

517
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,561
You know, it was a good three days.

518
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,050
I miss you real bad.

519
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,245
<i>I miss you too.</i>

520
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,842
Hey, you want me to talk dirty to you?

521
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,081
<i>Yeah.</i>

522
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,730
<i>Hold on. Hold on a second.</i>

523
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,568
But I got a phone in one hand
and a gun in the other...

524
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,449
...so I don't know what I'm gonna do.

525
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,285
Well, you're gonna have to decide
what's more important, baby.

526
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,089
You're horny preggers.

527
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,566
<i>Fat and horny.</i>

528
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,888
<i>- It's fucking disgusting.</i>
- Ha-ha-ha.

529
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,611
If you were 300 pounds, I'd still do you.

530
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,925
So romantic.

531
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,405
<i>How's my boy?</i>

532
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,889
Nobody said it's a boy.

533
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,926
I can't wait to see
the way you're gonna be with him.

534
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,971
<i>How do you know?</i>

535
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,441
I just know.

536
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,610
I can sense it.

537
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,450
I hope you're right.

538
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,647
<i>Baby, I am right.</i>

539
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,322
Hey, did your dad get ahold of you?

540
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,130
<i>No, I haven't checked my e-mails.</i>

541
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,406
Shit.

542
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,962
Okay, you need to hang up
and call him, all right?

543
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,167
<i>Why, what's wrong?</i>

544
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,288
Fuck, I'm so selfish.
I wasn't even thinking.

545
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,771
Taya, what's wrong?

546
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,451
<i>What happened?</i>

547
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,644
Your little brother deployed.

548
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,770
What? What happened to jump school?

549
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,967
No, he didn't get in.

550
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,248
You just hang up and call your dad, okay?

551
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,488
What do you mean? Deployed?
Where is he?

552
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,971
<i>Over there.</i>

553
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:05,005
<i>He's headed to Iraq.</i>

554
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,371
<i>I'm sorry, honey.</i>

555
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,123
The man with the blade?

556
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,329
He's a Jordanian militant.
He's funded by bin Laden.

557
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,165
He's trained by bin Laden.
He is loyal to bin Laden.

558
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,965
His name...

559
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,805
...is Zarqawi.

560
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,685
Now this asshole...

561
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,844
...is right now the crown prince
of al-Qaeda in Iraq.

562
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,403
His mercenary army, AQl?
They're 5000 strong.

563
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,841
Now, these guys
are not your average shit-kickers.

564
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,367
These guys are well-trained,
they are well-paid...

565
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,127
...and right now, they are waging
the largest urban assault since Vietnam.

566
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:47,890
Zarqawi and his lieutenants,
these are our top priority.

567
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,363
Now, there is only one way
to root these guys out...

568
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,046
...and that is to go door to door,
house to house...

569
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,683
...until we find them or we find someone
who will give us their whereabouts.

570
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,165
So we are going to need to clear
ten structures an hour...

571
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,370
...which, I know, is a lot.
It's aggressive.

572
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,524
We're gonna be loosening things up
with air support.

573
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,361
This is the highest priority target
we have to date.

574
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,689
I want this asshole dead or captured.

575
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,046
Do you understand?

576
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,370
Are there any questions?

577
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,046
These Marines keep rushing in
like they're doing...

578
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,440
...they'll have their asses shot off.
- They're Marines.

579
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,803
They don't get the training we do. Half
these guys were civilians six months ago.

580
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,407
Let's coach them. I'll show them how Team
guys do it. I'll lead the unit on the street.

581
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,528
No, we can't do that.
We need you on overwatch.

582
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,205
Come on. If I'm on the street, Marc...

583
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,328
House to house is
the deadliest job here, man.

584
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,131
- You got some sort of savior complex?
- I want to get the bad guys.

585
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,044
If I can't see them, I can't shoot them.

586
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,807
All these guys? They know your name,
and they feel invincible with you up there.

587
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,645
- They're not.
- They are if they think they are.

588
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,760
Just keep banging on the long gun.
We'll let these dogs sniff out Zarqawi.

589
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,171
You said AQl has a sniper
in the Olympics...

590
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,091
...but Iraq hasn't qualified a shooter
in three games.

591
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,085
Well, that's because Mustafa's not Iraqi.

592
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,890
He's from Syria.

593
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,607
Breacher up!

594
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,727
Hey, once you all gain entry
I can't see shit...

595
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,167
...so take it slow
and move through your target.

596
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,125
- Understood.
- Fire in the hole!

597
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,645
Man down!

598
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,929
You better back him down!

599
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,931
Oh, fuck this.

600
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,328
I'm gonna go clear houses with Marines.

601
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,887
- You coming?
- Fuck, no, I'm not coming.

602
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,647
No, man, I like my life.
I'd actually like to make it home alive.

603
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,928
It's not my job
to go fucking knocking down doors.

604
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,084
Those guys picked the wrong fucking job.
I'm not doing that shit.

605
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,527
All right.
Well, if I don't see you down there...

606
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,844
...you make sure I don't see you again.

607
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,001
- Hey. You all mind if I roll with you?
- Hey, man. Any SEAL is cool by me.

608
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,247
Breacher up!

609
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:39,524
You're the one they're calling the Legend.
You got 24 confirmed kills.

610
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,011
Well, who's counting?

611
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,525
That's fucking badass.

612
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,081
Yeah, I heard some motherfucker
in Bravo's catching up, yo.

613
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,527
I know y'all are meat-eaters,
but I know a couple things.

614
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,684
Simple shit I could show you. Maybe
keep us above ground. What do you say?

615
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,530
Yeah. All right.

616
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,881
Right on.

617
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,322
- Hey, what's that mean, bro?
- Breacher up.

618
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,760
Come on! Go!

619
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,207
Moving.

620
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,402
Get down! Get down
on the ground right now!

621
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,721
Get your fucking ass down!

622
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,167
- No, no!
- He no understand!

623
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,362
- Get down!
- Why are you here?!

624
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,887
You're supposed to be evacuated.
Why are you still here?

625
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,565
I am Sheikh al-Obeidi!

626
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,644
- Sheikh alla-who?! Who the fuck are you?!
- This my home! I stay!

627
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,565
I don't give a fuck it's your home!
This is a war zone, sir!

628
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,563
- Sir, please!
- Get that kid down!

629
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,200
Come on! Let's go! Move it!

630
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,842
- Found these bitches in the back closet.
- You are welcome here. You are my guest!

631
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,129
- How many more do you have here?!
- But tell the soldiers to come in.

632
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,931
This Haji just wants us
all in here so he can blow us up.

633
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,243
- If he see American, he know we speak.
- Who?

634
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,209
- Please.
- Who says talking of us?

635
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,120
- Please come in.
- Who knows we're talking?!

636
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,247
Who?!

637
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,687
He come. He...

638
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,249
He very bad. Please.

639
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,120
- Target secure?
- Target's secure.

640
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,403
Bring them in. Get your head down
on the ground. Hands behind your back.

641
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,730
- Now! Move now!
- Please, please.

642
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,530
You gonna talk, we'll talk to you.

643
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,610
Bring him in the other room.

644
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,290
If he talks to U.S. soldiers,
they will come and make examples of them.

645
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,601
He? Who's he? Who's he?

646
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,170
The man who comes they call
"The Butcher." He's the despaired one.

647
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,924
Son of Shaytan, son of Devil.

648
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,491
Oh, he's like an enforcer?

649
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,648
- Yes, enforcer.
- Number one soldier Zarqawi.

650
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,485
Zarqawi? Yeah, we'd like to know
where Zarqawi is.

651
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,484
Do you know where he is?
You tell us where he is right now.

652
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,971
How can we get him?

653
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,848
You have information for us
about Zarqawi, tell us right now.

654
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,642
Find The Butcher, you find Zarqawi.
He reports to him.

655
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,165
Okay, well, how do we find him?

656
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,003
All right, look at me when I'm talking
to you. Where do we find him?

657
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,811
We must understand the risk to them,
but he will ask for money.

658
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,290
He need $100,000.

659
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,891
You need $100,000?

660
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,650
I have no proof this guy exists.

661
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,001
Fatima!

662
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:21,841
Hello.

663
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,490
- This is the proof.
- Look, I wanna help you out. I do.

664
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,371
But I need something. I need
phone numbers, address, names.

665
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,726
You have to give me something.

666
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,322
Sir! First platoon's pinned down.

667
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,527
Move out!

668
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,883
Sheikh, look at me when I'm talking to you.
Hey! Look at me!

669
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,884
I need something.
I can help you out, sheikh.

670
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,042
You give me a name,
and we will take care of it.

671
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:50,885
I can promise you that.
We will give you safety. Tell me right now!

672
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,050
- Emile Anafanoos?
- Amir Khalaf Fanus.

673
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,884
This is given name of The Butcher.

674
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,770
We believe that The Butcher's
Zarqawi's number two man.

675
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,890
This is your guy right here.

676
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,408
But you don't know his real name.
Otherwise, you'd have written it up there.

677
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,644
We got several aliases.

678
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,922
Now, if "Fanus" is legit...

679
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,770
...we'll go see the sheikh.

680
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:17,371
He's asking for 100,000.

681
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,567
Figures.

682
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,001
But if he delivers The Butcher,
he's gonna get it.

683
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:22,926
This is Agent Snead, DIA.

684
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,607
I need a name check
on an "Amir Khalaf Fanus."

685
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,201
Yeah, I'll wait.

686
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,765
If we're gonna go back out there,
Team 3 can pull security.

687
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,730
Won't happen. Head-shed will want
contractors if we're humping money.

688
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:36,930
Yeah, I'm here. What do you got?

689
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,924
All right. Okay.

690
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,765
Let's go see the sheikh.

691
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,731
Road kill.

692
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,846
You know The Butcher
is Zarqawi's enforcer?

693
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,970
They say his weapon of choice
is a fucking drill.

694
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:14,810
Went to seminary school
before I joined the Navy.

695
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,804
Was close to being a preacher.

696
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,770
And why didn't you?

697
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,329
I love to gamble, man.

698
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,086
I love those dice.

699
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,720
That's my kind of preacher.

700
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,851
It's like that now, huh?

701
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:47,442
Haven't you heard?
I'm the Legend.

702
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,007
Hey, babe.

703
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,005
You were right. The doctor says it's a boy.

704
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,521
What?

705
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,531
It's a boy!

706
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,286
It's a boy?!

707
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:03,000
- Hell, yeah, man. Congratulations!
- Ha-ha-ha.

708
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,561
Chris?!

709
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,883
Down! Grab the money! Get to the truck!

710
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:33,046
Let's go! Let's go! Grab the bag!
Grab the bag!

711
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,047
Chris.

712
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,602
Go! Get the fuck out of here.
We'll come back for them.

713
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,806
Baby?

714
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,247
I heard one shot.

715
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,562
Check. Came in at an angle.

716
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,850
Be 300 or more yards out.

717
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,087
Oh, my God.

718
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:03,730
- You got a bead on him?
- I got Tango in the window.

719
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,885
Oh, shit.

720
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,123
I got eyes on The Butcher. He's got
the sheikh's kid on the avenue.

721
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:18,925
Requesting QRF.

722
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,482
We're being pinned down by sniper fire
on approach of high value target.

723
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,042
Grid 04536236. Over.

724
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,443
I'm gonna pop a smoke. I'm gonna secure
this building. I'm going to the roof.

725
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,727
Hold up!

726
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:43,282
Hold. Hold it.

727
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,287
Go!

728
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,161
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

729
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,041
Come on, you fucking son of a bitch!

730
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,091
Fuck you!

731
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,882
<i>Jesus Christ, what a fucking mess.</i>

732
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,403
You are one dumb son of a bitch,
you know that?

733
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,931
What the hell were you thinking?!

734
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,606
You completely failed
to secure the battlefield.

735
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:10,084
I'm shutting this whole thing down
pending an inquiry. Get back to base!

736
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,481
Hey, we gotta set up a squad
and pursue him.

737
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,244
Nope, they're shutting us down.

738
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,606
What do you mean?

739
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:17,800
Can't leave the wire till
they figure this shit out.

740
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,729
Well, he can't just leave us like that.

741
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,927
Hey!

742
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,565
I go home in three weeks!

743
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,563
Man, that's gonna be a long three weeks.

744
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,447
Hey.

745
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:20,960
Hey, baby.

746
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:24,126
I thought you were dead.

747
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,568
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

748
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:28,846
I thought you were dead.

749
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,525
I'm not. I'm right here.

750
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,885
- You all right?
- Yeah.

751
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,520
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

752
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,321
I have an alien growing inside me.

753
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,005
And there's a strange man in my bedroom.

754
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,770
It's our bedroom.

755
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,884
Your hands feel different.

756
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,888
Oh, no. They're my hands.

757
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,447
- Why am I so fucking nervous?
- Well, I am too.

758
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,760
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

759
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,211
- You're lying.
- I swear.

760
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,921
How do I know some alien in there
is not gonna come out and grab me...

761
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,605
...in the middle of the night?

762
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,524
I'm gonna have to...

763
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:42,406
...choke him out.

764
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,966
It's gonna be okay.

765
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,043
- Promise?
- Yeah, of course.

766
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,769
Why're you so good with me?

767
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,201
Hey, babe.
It might be nice to get out.

768
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:07,971
You listening to me?

769
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,447
- Chris.
- Huh?

770
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,970
What do you wanna do today, hon?

771
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,361
I thought we could just relax here.

772
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,970
Okay, we do that.

773
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:28,805
Let's relax.

774
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:31,690
What are you doing?

775
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,080
Putting my foot on you.

776
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,005
Well, you know that's the way to my heart.

777
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:39,884
I'm coming over.

778
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,283
- And that looks great.
- Oh, look.

779
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,329
Look. He's touching his nose.

780
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:56,531
- How are you feeling?
- I'm all right. I just want him out.

781
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,489
- I'm tired.
- It's gonna be any day now.

782
00:53:58,640 --> 00:53:59,687
I hope so.

783
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,805
- How about you? How're you feeling?
- I'm feeling good. Thank you, ma'am.

784
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,611
I imagine it's hard to decompress.

785
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,051
Not really. No.

786
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,771
This is the first time
we've left the house.

787
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,964
I'm happy to be home. Yeah.

788
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,371
Here. Slip this on for me, would you?

789
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,768
Uh, I think if you wanna check anything out,
you may wanna check out these knees.

790
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,520
- Are you a smoker?
- No, ma'am.

791
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:28,246
- You drink?
- Only when I'm thirsty.

792
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,207
It's 170/110.

793
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,203
Jesus Christ, Chris.

794
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,806
Is that high?

795
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,527
Not if you've just had 14 cups of coffee.
But for someone who is sitting down, yes.

796
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,728
Oh, I appreciate you taking a look at that.

797
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,087
I'll look into it. Thank you.

798
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,765
Will you look into it?

799
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,121
Yeah.

800
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:55,881
You sabotaged me back there.

801
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,964
What am I supposed to do? You're not
talking. You act like it's all okay.

802
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,851
- It is okay. I'm fine.
- You're not fine, Chris, all right?

803
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,924
Your blood pressure is,
like, fucking 170/110.

804
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,321
Babe, I'm driving down the freeway.

805
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,369
It's sunny. It's 72 degrees. I'm fine.

806
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,729
There's a war going on. There's people
dying. No one's even talking about that.

807
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,724
It's like it's not even happening.
We're all on our cell phones...

808
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,441
...living our simple, simplistic lives.
It's not even on the news.

809
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,444
No one cares. There's a war going on,
I'm headed to the mall.

810
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,090
I'm not supposed to be here.

811
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,287
It's happening.

812
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,602
- What's wrong? You okay?
- It's happening.

813
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,689
Shit. Okay. I'm gonna go back.

814
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:36,849
- You're fucking crazy! You know that?
- It's okay. Hey! Shh. Baby, baby.

815
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:40,206
Oh, my God. Baby.

816
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,930
You look beautiful.

817
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,924
It's fucking happening.

818
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,362
Oh, my baby.

819
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,281
Hey.

820
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,646
Look at your mama.

821
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,404
- Hi.
- Hey, pal.

822
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,244
- Hey.
- Hey, baby-

823
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,686
Hey, little guy.

824
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,285
Hey, baby.

825
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,885
Hey, little guy.

826
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,489
Look what we did.
Look what we did.

827
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,371
Look what we made.
Look what we made.

828
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,766
The baby's crying.
I thought you were gonna get him.

829
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,685
No, don't bother turning it off.
I already watched it.

830
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:31,203
Had to make sure you didn't have an
Iraqi girlfriend sending you sexy videos.

831
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,283
That's a sniper recording his kills.
Mustafa.

832
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,920
He sells that shit on the street.
Those are American soldiers.

833
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,161
That day that we were on the phone,
was that him?

834
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,047
Was it?

835
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,129
Chris, just talk about it. You're not
protecting me by not talking about it.

836
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,123
No, I don't want you
getting that in your head.

837
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,080
- My imagination is so much worse.
- Oh, no, it's not. They're savages.

838
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,128
- Chris.
- Babe, they're fucking savages.

839
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,691
It's not about them.

840
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,570
It's about us.

841
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:01,087
What?

842
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,887
You have to make it back to us.

843
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,406
Okay?

844
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:19,480
Welcome home, chief.

845
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:21,881
Colonel Jones is waiting.
How was the flight?

846
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:24,560
- Longer than Christmas.
- I bet.

847
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,448
Hey. Can you wait a second?

848
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:32,170
All right. Hurry up.

849
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,846
Hey, grunt!

850
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,526
Chris?

851
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,006
Hey, brother!

852
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:41,248
- Hi.
- Ha-ha-ha.

853
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,890
You all right?
You in one piece?

854
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:47,250
I heard you been kicking ass out here. All
the guys, that's what they've been saying.

855
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,521
That's what they say?

856
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,364
How you doing? You okay?

857
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:53,091
- Shoot, it's good to see you.
- You're my hero, bro.

858
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,123
Okay? You always have been.

859
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,561
Let's go, Kyle! Colonel's waiting.

860
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,960
The Legend, huh?

861
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,651
What happened?
You all right?

862
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,286
Man, I'm gonna miss my ride.

863
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,680
Hey, what happened?

864
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,165
I'm just tired, man.

865
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,003
I'm going home.

866
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,600
I'm proud of you.

867
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,046
Dad is too.
Dad's proud of you.

868
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:22,046
- Fuck this place.
- Huh?

869
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,887
What'd you say?

870
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,011
Fuck this place.

871
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,209
Chief, we gotta move. Let's go!

872
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,809
<i>You made chief. Congratulations.</i>

873
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:58,200
Thank you, sir.

874
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:01,851
Gronski's gone. A lot of top brass are.

875
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,490
Running off a new play book now.

876
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,768
I've studied insurgencies
for the last decade.

877
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,491
I know every stone thrown
since before the first century.

878
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,970
These wars are won and lost
in the minds of our enemy.

879
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,326
Yes, sir.

880
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:17,927
That you?

881
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:21,522
That's a Crusader cross. Yes, sir.

882
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,447
Yeah.

883
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:26,161
You're now the most wanted man in Iraq.

884
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,721
There's 180,000 on your head.
Congrats.

885
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,451
Well, don't tell my wife.
She might take that number right now.

886
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:37,086
Understand you wanna put together a
direct action squad to hunt The Butcher.

887
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,401
Yes, sir.

888
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,644
We got some intel
indicating his area of operations.

889
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,649
I want you to put the fear of God
into these savages...

890
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,165
...and find his ass.

891
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,121
Yes, sir.

892
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,686
All right, let's go get this motherfucker.

893
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:59,806
- Gonna be a pop quiz before we leave.
- Small words next time, Big Legend.

894
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,724
- What'd you say?
- Small words next time

895
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:03,962
I'll tell you those stories
if you want them.

896
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,600
- One hell of a PowerPoint, man.
- Oh, thanks, Biggles.

897
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,769
Always gotta say something, motherfucker.

898
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,491
That Bible of yours, is that bulletproof?

899
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:12,971
What, the one I put in here?

900
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,249
Yeah. I just never saw you open it.
I assumed...

901
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:20,089
God, country, family, right?

902
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,080
You got a God?

903
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,321
I got a God? You getting weird on me?

904
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,889
Growing up in Oregon, we had this
electric fence around our property.

905
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,010
Us kids would grab onto it
and see who could hold on the longest.

906
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,564
War feels kind of like that.

907
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,882
Puts lightning in your bones and makes it
hard to hold onto anything else.

908
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,203
Hey, man, you need to sit this one out?

909
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,768
I just wanna believe
in what we're doing here.

910
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:52,809
Oh, there's evil here. We've seen it.

911
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,409
Yeah. There's evil everywhere.

912
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,803
Oh, you want these motherfuckers
to come to San Diego or New York?

913
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:02,161
We're protecting more than just this dirt.

914
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:05,401
All right.

915
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,930
Let's go kill this fucker.

916
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,281
Bingo.

917
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,805
It's the building right here.

918
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,770
Any apartment on the east side
faces the restaurant.

919
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,083
In front of me, sir. Go, go, go.

920
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,521
Clear.

921
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,406
Other door.

922
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,127
Get down on the ground.
Get down on the ground now.

923
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,723
- Put your hands behind your back.
- Okay.

924
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,611
Target secure.

925
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,685
I got the window, Chris.

926
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,848
- Set security, boys.
- Get set up.

927
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:13,087
Corner.

928
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,609
Let's move them in the other room.

929
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,246
Y'all ask if he knows him?

930
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,561
You recognize this guy?

931
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,206
He says he does not.

932
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,328
How about you, son?
You recognize this face?

933
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,281
You sure?

934
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,966
All right, well, you make sure you tell them
they're not gonna go anywhere until we do.

935
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,290
Hey, you keep eyes on that window.

936
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:46,046
Make sure you take pictures
of anybody coming and going.

937
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,446
What do we got?

938
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,806
Sixteen military-age males have gone in.

939
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:11,007
Sixteen?

940
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,448
Yeah, they serve more customers
than a fucking McDonald's.

941
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,611
Here, check this out.

942
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:22,960
Is he still in there?

943
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,371
I clocked one point of entry.

944
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:27,560
He's in there, but it's not gonna be
an easy breach.

945
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,330
Oh, I don't know about that, man.

946
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,848
Probably see the Legend and just let him
right in, you know, big-time celebrity.

947
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,729
Ask him to sign their burka.

948
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,167
- Appear at their child's birthday parties.
- Ha-ha-ha.

949
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,846
Hey, what is your problem?
I didn't promote myself.

950
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,247
Yeah, no shit, motherfucker.
I did that for you.

951
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:47,042
You would've never made chief if I had
nicknamed you the fucking Myth or some shit.

952
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,887
He invites you to join him
for Eid al-Adha supper.

953
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:00,522
He says, on this day,
everyone has a seat at my table.

954
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,164
Oh, that's very generous of him.

955
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,163
That was, like, close, man.

956
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,081
- Have some. Pretty good.
- That's very nice.

957
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,327
Take a cucumber.

958
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,131
Take cucumber
and put it in a tub with vinegar.

959
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,327
Yeah.

960
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,847
Stick in cayenne pepper,
add a lemon in it...

961
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,650
...and let it soak overnight.

962
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:32,686
It's that, just add vodka.
That's the idea. You wanna get in on it?

963
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:35,730
- Let's do it. I'm a ground-floor investor.
- All right.

964
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:38,087
Biggles, you never cooked
a day in your life.

965
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,723
Dude, that was the real question.
That was super real.

966
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,690
All these random people getting behind us.

967
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,968
Get my father to fall in behind me.

968
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:54,721
Holy shit.

969
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:03,608
- Squirrel? You want some olives?
- No, I don't do olives, man.

970
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:09,005
- Somebody will get on that lamb head?
- No, no.

971
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,563
Come on, man. Get some brains!

972
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,728
I gotta wash my hands.

973
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,370
- It's good.
- It's good?

974
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,681
Hey, man.

975
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:21,126
This is good, man.

976
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:36,400
Go check that out, Biggles.

977
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:38,090
- Stay right here!
- Wait.

978
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:40,971
- What the fuck?!
- Biggles, help me out here.

979
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,602
See that, muj? Huh?

980
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,087
You see that?

981
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,568
- What the fuck's going on?
- Bring the Terp in.

982
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,767
Oh, shit.

983
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:56,887
All right. Now you tell him that he's
gonna be sent off to detention...

984
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,611
...and the Iraqi courts can decide
what to do with him.

985
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,331
Or he can help us get inside
that restaurant downstairs.

986
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,482
You tell him. Say it's his choice.

987
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:38,131
That's it.

988
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:40,766
All clear.

989
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,730
Good, good. Moving.

990
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:48,726
Assault team set.

991
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,490
Green-side security set.

992
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:56,241
Package is moving.

993
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,685
Fifteen meters out.

994
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,367
Ten meters.

995
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,326
Five meters.

996
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:32,441
He's knocking.

997
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,247
Hold.

998
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:40,961
They're vetting him.

999
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,005
Lights out, muj.

1000
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:47,446
Execute. Execute.

1001
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:57,361
Frag out! Frag out!

1002
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,166
Aah!

1003
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:08,927
- Anything coming out the back?
- Negative. No movement.

1004
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,723
Oh, shit.

1005
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:21,890
- "D", take him down.
- Got him.

1006
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:26,080
Get him down.

1007
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:31,726
Oh, shit!

1008
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:34,080
<i>We found a tunnel. Watch your back.
Keep your eyes open.</i>

1009
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,525
Contact front!

1010
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,368
Contact! Fall back!

1011
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,131
White-side, all security. White-side.

1012
01:10:42,680 --> 01:10:43,761
Butcher's on the move.

1013
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,882
Repeat: Butcher's on the move,
I'm in pursuit.

1014
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,366
Butcher's down. Moving your position.

1015
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:25,368
I offered him detention.
It was his choice.

1016
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:28,364
Picked the wrong side.
It's all there is to it. Fog of war.

1017
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,651
Yo, Chris!

1018
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,571
Fuck them, man. Let's go.
Shit's getting hairy.

1019
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,166
Armed insurgents are moving this way.
We need to make tracks.

1020
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,367
Good job here, chief.

1021
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,766
- Want another one or are you good?
- Look. What is this?

1022
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:29,082
You get what it gives you.
That's how this thing works.

1023
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:31,601
You don't get that one,
if that's the one you want.

1024
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,171
I like that.

1025
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,284
That's good. That's strong.

1026
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,489
- Chris, your truck's ready.
- You can move that all you want.

1027
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,768
Your truck's ready. Impossible.

1028
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,291
Give me your credit card.

1029
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,124
Okay. Interesting.

1030
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:54,282
- I gave it to you?
- Right.

1031
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,727
- Pick it up off the floor.
- See if Chris Kyle's on file?

1032
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:00,161
Off the floor.
Make sure you get all of them up.

1033
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,685
Well, you got one back here.

1034
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:02,966
Excuse me, sir?

1035
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:04,451
Uh...

1036
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,165
Are you Chief Chris Kyle?

1037
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:08,441
Yes, sir.

1038
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,482
My name is Mads. Um...

1039
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:13,563
We met in Fallujah. You saved my life.

1040
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:16,801
I did?

1041
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,007
Yes, sir.

1042
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,325
We were stuck in a house
until you came in with the 1st Marines.

1043
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:22,811
You carried me out.

1044
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,321
Oh, wow. Well, the Marines saved our
ass plenty of times.

1045
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,881
- How are you? All right? You holding up?
- Great. Yeah.

1046
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,850
I'm just grateful to be alive.

1047
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,485
It hasn't been...

1048
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:35,320
- It hasn't been easy.
- Oh.

1049
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:37,481
Well, you know.

1050
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:43,282
- A lot of guys lost more than just a leg.
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

1051
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:44,925
Did you lose some friends?

1052
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:47,447
Well, that too.
But I'm talking about the guys that lived.

1053
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,365
You know, that made it back,
but they're just not back, you know?

1054
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,488
- They can't seem to get right.
- Yeah.

1055
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,086
Mm-hm.

1056
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:58,363
Why don't you come down to the VA
sometime. The guys would love it.

1057
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,849
They all know who the Legend is.

1058
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,608
- Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
- Hey, buddy.

1059
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:08,250
Can I tell you something?

1060
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:11,720
Your dad? He's a hero.

1061
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:14,567
That's right.

1062
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,167
He saved my life...

1063
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,290
...and he helped me get back
to my little girl.

1064
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:22,760
So thank you for lending him to us.

1065
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:24,001
Okay.

1066
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,124
I wouldn't be here without him.

1067
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:34,689
My family thanks you for your service.

1068
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,247
Okay, thank you. All right.

1069
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:41,926
- Take care of yourself.
- It's great to see you again.

1070
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:44,566
- Come down to the VA sometime.
- Okay. Yeah.

1071
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,245
Grab your little lizard up there.

1072
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,250
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1073
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,164
- Have a good day.
- You have a good day.

1074
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,401
Goodbye.

1075
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,642
All right, let's go meet your sister, bubba.

1076
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,602
Hey. Some help here?
My daughter's crying.

1077
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:35,603
That's my daughter over there.
I think she's crying. Tend to her, please?

1078
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,006
Excuse me.

1079
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,207
Hey!

1080
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:41,800
Hey, where you going?

1081
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:43,086
Hey!

1082
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:46,281
Hey, would you tend to my daughter,
please?

1083
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,887
Hey!

1084
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:55,724
Hey! Tend to my daughter, please!
Right now!

1085
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,807
I'm making memories by myself.

1086
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,004
I have no one to share them with.

1087
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,325
Yeah, well, we got our
whole lives for that.

1088
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:14,045
When does that start?

1089
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,641
Even when you're here, you're not here.

1090
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,126
I see you.

1091
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:21,766
I feel you.

1092
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,730
But you're not here.

1093
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:44,008
I hate the Teams for it.

1094
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:47,361
I do.

1095
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:49,770
You're my husband.

1096
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,367
You're the father of my children, but
they're the ones that pull you back.

1097
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:03,169
Yeah, but, you see,
they can't wait and we can.

1098
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,563
If you think this war isn't changing you,
you're wrong.

1099
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:17,251
You can only circle the flame so long.

1100
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:30,086
It's true.

1101
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:52,960
Cadillac 31 actual, we're tailing The Butcher's
courier currently on Maryland Street. Over.

1102
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,763
Hey! Got the ring.

1103
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:57,966
From where?
From here?

1104
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,441
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah.
It's so much cheaper here.

1105
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:04,402
Dude, you bought it from savages? How
do you know it's not a blood diamond?

1106
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,005
What the fuck do you care, man?

1107
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:08,851
You've spilled so much blood over here.
You're the Legend.

1108
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,331
It's not for a rock.

1109
01:18:10,480 --> 01:18:12,482
Oh, what the fuck ever, man.

1110
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,611
That's just hypocritical.

1111
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,762
Hey, ease up on that.
Don't get too close.

1112
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,088
Hey, did you tell her
where you bought it from?

1113
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,811
Fuck no. I'm gonna tell her
I got that shit from Zales.

1114
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,288
<i>Hey, you still with us, cookie?</i>

1115
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,044
Just a half block back, baby.

1116
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,129
We are wet and ready, Big Giggles.

1117
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,811
You know, "D"...

1118
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:35,284
...I predict in 20 years,
we're gonna have a reunion...

1119
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,404
...you'll be married to a dude.

1120
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,169
As long as you can cook and clean.

1121
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:50,686
Now, there they are.

1122
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:52,001
Oh, shit.

1123
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,931
Mustafa's got his peepers out.

1124
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:58,169
This motherfucker
is Keyser fucking Söze, bro.

1125
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,364
Next time you get a clear shot,
you try not to miss him, all right?

1126
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:20,803
Well, I would've gotten him in the alleyway
if I didn't have to save your ass.

1127
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,366
So you gonna be my best man?

1128
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,522
Just me? Or is it gonna be
everybody else too?

1129
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,404
There's only gonna be one best man,
dude.

1130
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:03,244
Vehicle 1 taking fire.

1131
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:05,848
- Come on, give me a shot.
- All right.

1132
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:27,562
- Uhn!
- Biggles, move.

1133
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,606
Clear.

1134
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:36,646
One on me.

1135
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:50,446
<i>We got them.</i>

1136
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,762
<i>Vehicle is secure. Two EKA.</i>

1137
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,685
<i>Set security, Chris.</i>

1138
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:56,881
Nope.

1139
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:58,965
Rooftop's secure.

1140
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:02,687
Ahem. Aren't you worried that she's
gonna take that thing to Zales...

1141
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:04,410
...find out how much you spent?

1142
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:06,481
Well, no, I wasn't.

1143
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:07,801
Set security.

1144
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,327
- Now I'm a little worried about it.
- You should be.

1145
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,926
What do you mean,
she can trace the diamond to Zales?

1146
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:14,320
I don't think that's gonna...

1147
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,282
You okay, buddy?
You're all right.

1148
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,290
Got a man down.
Biggles is down.

1149
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:28,801
Northwest corner.

1150
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,007
Rooftop.

1151
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:35,486
Hang in there, bud.

1152
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,090
I need a corpsman right now!

1153
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:56,211
Okay, bubba. We're gonna pick you up.
I'm gonna take you downstairs.

1154
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,840
I can walk.

1155
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:15,647
There we go.

1156
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,529
Let's get him in the Humvee.

1157
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:18,727
Taking off.

1158
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:21,042
I got him. I got him.

1159
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,331
Get in. Hang in there, Biggles.

1160
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:27,527
Fuck.

1161
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,284
Hang in there, Biggles.

1162
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,090
Hang in, Biggles.

1163
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,522
- It's okay.
- Shit, I'm sorry, man.

1164
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:37,767
For what?

1165
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,691
What are you sorry for?
It's my fault we went on that roof.

1166
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:42,080
Am I gonna die?

1167
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:44,322
Fuck no, Biggles.
You're a fucking frogman.

1168
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:45,965
Frogmen don't fucking die.

1169
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:49,408
Gonna put some sand in this fucking cut,
get you a fucking canteen of water.

1170
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:51,528
You're gonna be fucking fine.
Hang in there.

1171
01:22:51,680 --> 01:22:54,411
Hey, Chris. You make sure
she gets that ring, all right?

1172
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,721
Sure will.

1173
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:03,286
- Let's increase suction.
- The retractor, please.

1174
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:04,807
More blood.

1175
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,440
How long before we get film?

1176
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,166
We need another unit of blood.

1177
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,330
- Got that.
- Saline, now.

1178
01:23:11,480 --> 01:23:14,484
- More suction.
- Hold your hand right here.

1179
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,005
Type and cross.

1180
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,924
Get it up. I need those numbers now.

1181
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:28,370
Did you see where it came from?

1182
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,487
It was more than 1000 meters out.

1183
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:34,486
Only one enemy sniper
could've made that shot.

1184
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:37,566
Will he make it?

1185
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,087
Took a round off the feed tray cover
of his 48.

1186
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:42,121
Doesn't look good.

1187
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,364
That's the first SEAL hit, sir.

1188
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:45,967
Fuck!

1189
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:51,730
Shi'a cab driver we source is saying
there's a stronghold seven doors down.

1190
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:54,240
Marine units covered your exfil
are still engaged there.

1191
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,960
I can understand if you want
to stand down and regroup.

1192
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:58,566
It's up to you.

1193
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:00,607
<i>Lex talionis.</i>

1194
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:03,127
Eye for an eye.

1195
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,246
We're going back out.

1196
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:13,249
- Fucking-A.
- Fuck, yes.

1197
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,046
Let's go.

1198
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:17,927
It's on.

1199
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:48,967
Hey!

1200
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:53,764
Two klicks out.

1201
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:22,965
Hallway clear.

1202
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:24,681
On the left.

1203
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:25,921
Bumpy.

1204
01:25:29,560 --> 01:25:30,721
Hallway.

1205
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:36,168
Hallway clear. On the left.

1206
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,201
Clear.

1207
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,440
All clear.

1208
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,206
All clear.

1209
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:53,327
Hey, Marc.
Looks like someone left in a hurry. Huh?

1210
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,410
- Man down!
- Contact window!

1211
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:01,925
Man down!

1212
01:26:02,520 --> 01:26:03,567
Contact window!

1213
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,046
Contact window!

1214
01:26:15,520 --> 01:26:16,567
Come on, Marc.

1215
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,321
Let's go, buddy.

1216
01:26:20,760 --> 01:26:23,286
I got you, man. I got you.
Look at me. Look at me!

1217
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:26,491
I got you.

1218
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,121
Marc's gone, bro.

1219
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:42,684
I got One Sierra down.
I need a CASEVAC immediately.

1220
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:44,604
We gotta fucking move him.

1221
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,489
<i>"Glory is something some men chase...</i>

1222
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:59,564
<i>...and others find themselves
stumbling upon...</i>

1223
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:01,927
<i>...not expecting to find it.</i>

1224
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:05,046
<i>Either way, it is a noble
gesture that one...</i>

1225
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:06,970
...finds bestowed upon them.

1226
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:10,920
My question is
when does glory fade away...

1227
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:13,248
...and become the wrongful crusade?

1228
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,164
Or an unjustified means...

1229
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:18,802
...by which consumes one completely?

1230
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,047
I've...

1231
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,568
...seen war...

1232
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:25,571
...and I've seen...

1233
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:27,567
...death."

1234
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:30,521
Detail. Ten-hut!

1235
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,644
Port arms.

1236
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,401
Ready.

1237
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:38,327
Aim.

1238
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:39,847
Fire.

1239
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:41,687
Ready.

1240
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,647
Aim.

1241
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,167
Fire.

1242
01:27:45,640 --> 01:27:46,687
Ready.

1243
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:48,407
Aim.

1244
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:49,847
Fire.

1245
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:52,687
Present arms.

1246
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,367
Marc wrote that letter two weeks ago.

1247
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,371
Did he say any of that to you?

1248
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:05,730
Chris, I wanna know
what you thought of his letter.

1249
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:09,607
An AQl informant had called in a tip...

1250
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:12,286
...and Biggles had just been shot.

1251
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:15,444
We were operating out of emotion,
and we just walked right into an ambush.

1252
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,241
But that's not what killed him.

1253
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,681
That letter did.
That letter killed Marc.

1254
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:27,084
I mean, he just let go,
and he paid the price for it.

1255
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:39,440
Sign in here?

1256
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:51,966
Hey, buddy.

1257
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,290
- Hey, Chris?
- Yeah.

1258
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:56,563
- Where you at?
- I'm right here. Right here.

1259
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,964
- Oh, shit. You're blind as a bat.
- Yeah, it fucking blows.

1260
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:03,969
- They say they're gonna fix my face, though.
- Oh, thank God.

1261
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,243
About time.
Your face needs some fixing.

1262
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,606
It's too soon, man.

1263
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:08,841
It's too soon?

1264
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:10,286
Way too soon.

1265
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,249
Hey, I heard you proposed.

1266
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,528
- Yeah.
- Well, good for you.

1267
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:17,162
You didn't tell her
you bought that diamond...

1268
01:30:17,320 --> 01:30:19,322
- You told her you bought it at Zales, right?
- No.

1269
01:30:19,480 --> 01:30:20,606
- You didn't?
- No.

1270
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:22,205
No, got a new one.

1271
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,082
It's a smaller one.
Her dad helped me out with it.

1272
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:26,287
Oh, nice.

1273
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,289
- Oh, good.
- Mm-hm.

1274
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,323
She wouldn't leave me, bro.

1275
01:30:32,640 --> 01:30:34,927
I told her to go, and she wouldn't leave.

1276
01:30:36,440 --> 01:30:38,329
She's getting a raw fucking deal.

1277
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,964
Why would you say that?

1278
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:43,482
Don't say that.
She's got you.

1279
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:47,324
All two inches of you.

1280
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:48,766
Two inches.

1281
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:53,683
Yeah, you know, I'm glad
this happened to me and not you.

1282
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:55,609
Ain't no way you could've handled it.

1283
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:57,211
Yeah, you're probably right.

1284
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:01,369
So they say you're the deadliest sniper
in U.S. military history.

1285
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:02,886
Oh, is that right?

1286
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,166
That's what I heard.

1287
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:08,681
Them bad guys ended up in Sadr City.

1288
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:09,887
You're not going back.

1289
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:11,883
We are. We'll wall them in
and hunt them down.

1290
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:14,407
- Come on. You don't have to do that.
- We have to do that.

1291
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:16,527
You're my brother...

1292
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:19,405
...and they're gonna fucking pay
for what they did to you.

1293
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:22,846
Hooyah, Legend.

1294
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:25,570
Fucking hooyah.

1295
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:33,563
Something happens to me...

1296
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,804
...you'd be all right.

1297
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:38,329
You'd find someone else.

1298
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,049
Do you wanna die?

1299
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,804
Is that what it is?

1300
01:31:46,040 --> 01:31:47,087
No.

1301
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:50,009
Then just tell me.

1302
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:52,566
Tell me why you do it.

1303
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:54,245
- Oh, come on.
- I wanna understand.

1304
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:56,522
Babe, I do it for you.
I do it to protect you.

1305
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,808
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

1306
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:03,569
I'm here. Your family is here.
Your children have no father.

1307
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:07,122
- Yeah, well, I have to serve my country.
- Such fucking bullshit!

1308
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:08,446
No, it's not.

1309
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:10,130
You don't know when to quit.

1310
01:32:11,560 --> 01:32:15,406
You did your part. We've sacrificed enough.
You let somebody else go.

1311
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:16,925
Let somebody else go?

1312
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:20,608
- Babe, I couldn't live with myself if I did.
- Yeah, well, you find a way.

1313
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:21,926
You have to.

1314
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,647
Okay, I need you to be human again.

1315
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:34,605
I need you here.

1316
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:39,167
Baby, I need you here.

1317
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,809
If you leave again...

1318
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:47,971
...I don't think we'll be here
when you get back.

1319
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,161
Come here.

1320
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:15,527
Hey, Chris.

1321
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:17,165
Oh, man.

1322
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:20,045
We've been shot off position
three nights in a row, man.

1323
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:24,211
Fallujah was bad. Ramadi was worse.
This shit is fucking biblical, Chris.

1324
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:26,203
Is there any other Punishers here?

1325
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:27,641
Squirrel cycled out.

1326
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,486
And Dauber was coming back,
but his wife knocked him up.

1327
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:34,326
And if I bring home another rug, my wife'll
murder my motherfucking ass, Chris.

1328
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,323
- Teams and shit, right?
- Teams and shit.

1329
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,050
Man, that Biggles news hit hard, man.

1330
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:40,202
I went to see him in the hospital
before I left.

1331
01:33:40,360 --> 01:33:42,010
Motherfucker can't see shit.

1332
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,570
Biggles is gone, Chris.

1333
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:47,370
He was in surgery yesterday...

1334
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:49,451
...and he died on that table.

1335
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:59,280
<i>Hey, this is Taya.</i>

1336
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,488
<i>I can't get to the phone,
so please leave a message.</i>

1337
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:02,687
<i>It's me...</i>

1338
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:04,569
<i>...just calling to hear your voice.</i>

1339
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:06,565
<i>I'm missing you guys.</i>

1340
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:09,007
<i>Been thinking about some things you said.</i>

1341
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:11,770
<i>Tell the kids I love them.</i>

1342
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:13,721
<i>I love you too.</i>

1343
01:35:21,440 --> 01:35:22,771
Don't pick it up.

1344
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,689
Don't you fucking pick it up.

1345
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:35,770
Son of a bitch.

1346
01:35:39,680 --> 01:35:41,330
Fucking drop it.

1347
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:55,970
Drop it, you little cocksucker.

1348
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,320
<i>All right, listen up.</i>

1349
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:28,488
The head-shed believe
this T-wall here will help...

1350
01:36:28,640 --> 01:36:31,723
...win the war by trapping
the remaining AQl behind it.

1351
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,600
Problem is the engineers building
the thing are getting picked off...

1352
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:37,724
...by a sniper from deep behind the wall.
- How deep?

1353
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:39,881
Roughly 1000 meters.

1354
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:41,690
- Is it Mustafa?
- Mu-who?

1355
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,887
I don't know, dude.

1356
01:36:43,040 --> 01:36:44,849
Sniper who killed
our fucking friend, Biggles.

1357
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,083
He can be whoever the fuck you need
him to be. We just need him dead.

1358
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:51,329
We'll shuttle you six blocks north into
enemy territory which will put you...

1359
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:53,680
...right under the sniper's nose
when he takes his shot.

1360
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:55,370
In the middle of a fucking sandstorm?

1361
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,124
Bring your fucking goggles, Bambi.

1362
01:36:57,280 --> 01:36:59,442
We need to shut this shooter down.

1363
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,449
Understood? Gear up.

1364
01:37:01,640 --> 01:37:02,721
Yes, sir.

1365
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:04,365
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1366
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:11,007
Clear.

1367
01:39:11,160 --> 01:39:12,571
We're maneuver. You're base.

1368
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:13,881
Go.

1369
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,041
Go!

1370
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,081
Clear.

1371
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:23,607
Moving.

1372
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:25,364
Go! Go!

1373
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,521
All clear.

1374
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,206
Set security.

1375
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:12,081
The streets are crawling.
Hold your fire.

1376
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,163
Enter the fucking sandman.

1377
01:41:04,560 --> 01:41:05,971
- Stay down!
- Sniper!

1378
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:10,641
Shit!

1379
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:13,163
Shot came from the east!

1380
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,322
We set up in the wrong fucking direction.

1381
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,128
Doesn't matter.
Hold your fire.

1382
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:26,645
We got uglies right below us.

1383
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:02,526
I got something 1900 yards out.

1384
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:06,886
Fuck, he can't even see that far out.
Hold your fire. You'll expose us all.

1385
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,042
He's right, Legend. <i>No bueno.</i>

1386
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,721
Correction. It's 2100 yards out.

1387
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:16,320
That's more than a mile.
Impossible shot, Chris.

1388
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:29,887
It's him.

1389
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:35,931
This is Task Unit Bruiser. I got eyes
on target. Initiate QRF. Over.

1390
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:39,402
Copy that. ET on
Quick Reaction Force is 20 minutes out.

1391
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:56,565
He has eyes on our guys.

1392
01:42:56,720 --> 01:42:58,210
Can you confirm it's him?

1393
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:02,411
It's him.

1394
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:04,771
Oh, it's him.

1395
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:06,206
It's your call, Chris.

1396
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:09,929
Quick Reaction Force is 20 minutes
out. You'll stand the fuck down!

1397
01:43:23,480 --> 01:43:24,970
If you got it, take it, man.

1398
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:29,728
Aim small, miss small.

1399
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,804
Do it for Biggles.

1400
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:08,370
You just fucked us, Legend.

1401
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:12,646
Tango down.

1402
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,490
We need QRF ASAP!

1403
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,884
Mission accomplished.

1404
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:23,164
He had eyes on our guys.

1405
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:24,686
<i>And I took him out.</i>

1406
01:44:24,840 --> 01:44:27,320
Yeah. And now we're fucked
like a football bat!

1407
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:31,971
Biggles would be proud.

1408
01:44:34,360 --> 01:44:35,691
You did it, Chris.

1409
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:42,042
Echo 7 Kilo, be advised you have
enemy approaching all directions of your pos.

1410
01:44:42,200 --> 01:44:45,010
White-side! Goddamn it, Legend. Fuck!

1411
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:46,685
Yeah, let's go. Come on.

1412
01:44:53,320 --> 01:44:56,722
All right, I see two ways up on the roof.
Now, we wanna lock both staircases.

1413
01:44:56,880 --> 01:44:58,086
<i>Conserve ammo.</i>

1414
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,326
Get some, motherfuckers.

1415
01:45:57,720 --> 01:46:00,929
Echo 7 Kilo, you have
Tango-heavy gun on your green-side.

1416
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,051
<i>We're taking effective fire white-side!</i>

1417
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:47,168
<i>Effective fire, white-side!</i>

1418
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:53,007
Oh... Whew.

1419
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:58,122
"D", I'm down to two mags. We gotta move!

1420
01:46:58,680 --> 01:47:00,205
Don't stop fucking shooting, man!

1421
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:04,168
QRF's stuck three blocks out.

1422
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:18,205
- I'm out!
- 3 o'clock. Loading last mag.

1423
01:47:18,360 --> 01:47:20,647
<i>- We're pushing air.
- Only got one mag left!</i>

1424
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:22,006
<i>I'm black! I'm black!</i>

1425
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:23,486
<i>Anybody got a mag?!</i>

1426
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:26,211
<i>We can't hold them any longer!
We gotta move!</i>

1427
01:47:26,360 --> 01:47:27,850
Those guys are sitting ducks.

1428
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:31,522
- I don't wanna get dragged in the street.
- That's it. Do it.

1429
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:33,681
Call it in.

1430
01:47:33,880 --> 01:47:35,928
This is Rio 2 Bravo
requesting ordnance drop.

1431
01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:39,050
Grid number 04837959.

1432
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:42,240
<i>- That target location is your position.
- I know my fucking position.</i>

1433
01:47:42,360 --> 01:47:46,251
<i>- They're right on top of us. Just drop it!
- Viper 34, move to final attack heading.</i>

1434
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,211
Viper 34. Roger.

1435
01:47:48,360 --> 01:47:49,725
Thirty seconds out.

1436
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:02,885
<i>Hello?</i>

1437
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:05,447
Baby?

1438
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,807
<i>Chris?!</i>

1439
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,731
<i>Baby, I ca... Baby, I can't hear you.
Hello?</i>

1440
01:48:11,200 --> 01:48:12,565
I'm ready.

1441
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:15,609
I'm ready to come home.

1442
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:17,241
<i>What?</i>

1443
01:48:20,200 --> 01:48:21,770
I have the building in sight.

1444
01:48:24,040 --> 01:48:25,565
<i>What's happening?</i>

1445
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:30,003
I'm ready to come home, baby.

1446
01:48:31,080 --> 01:48:32,127
Chris?

1447
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,770
Pretty bad air up here.

1448
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:38,331
<i>I can't hold this much longer.</i>

1449
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:39,970
Tell the pilot "turn it loose."

1450
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:42,521
<i>Viper 34. Fire away.</i>

1451
01:48:47,120 --> 01:48:48,167
<i>Target missed.</i>

1452
01:48:51,720 --> 01:48:52,801
Shit.

1453
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,606
We need to exfil now!

1454
01:48:55,760 --> 01:48:57,762
Let's go! Let's move!

1455
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:04,291
We gotta move!

1456
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:15,651
<i>Echo 7 Kilo,
green-side is clear for exit.</i>

1457
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:22,284
I got the out. Green-side pole on my go!

1458
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,165
Down the roof!

1459
01:49:27,240 --> 01:49:28,287
Let's go!

1460
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:48,321
Last man!

1461
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:09,165
Get to the trucks!

1462
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:22,764
Go! Go! Go!

1463
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:24,365
Come on! Inside!

1464
01:50:24,520 --> 01:50:26,887
- That's one!
- Get in now! Gotta go!

1465
01:50:40,120 --> 01:50:41,690
Come on! We gotta go! Now!

1466
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:43,251
Shit! Let me on!

1467
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:45,446
Come on. Let me on.

1468
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,211
- Where's Chris?
- What?

1469
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:52,647
He was just behind me.
Where is Chris, man?

1470
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:56,361
Open the fucking door!

1471
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:02,327
Stop the goddamn rig!

1472
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:08,806
Chris, come on!

1473
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:10,606
Come on, you squid!

1474
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,801
We can't leave you! Come on, Chris!
Grab my hand!

1475
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:16,883
Grab his hand, "D"! Come on!

1476
01:51:17,040 --> 01:51:18,087
Pull him in now!

1477
01:51:18,240 --> 01:51:20,049
We gotta go! Now!

1478
01:51:21,320 --> 01:51:22,765
Come on, Legend! Get in here!

1479
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:24,410
Come on, Chris! Pull!

1480
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:36,686
Yeah?

1481
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,171
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

1482
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:41,529
I just got this weird message that
you were on a plane or something?

1483
01:52:41,880 --> 01:52:44,167
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I got out early.</i>

1484
01:52:44,360 --> 01:52:45,691
You did?

1485
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:48,682
So, what, are you in Germany, or...?
Where?

1486
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:50,444
No, I'm here.

1487
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:54,725
I'm stateside.

1488
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:57,046
You're home?

1489
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:00,242
What are you doing?

1490
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:07,042
I guess I just needed a minute.

1491
01:53:09,880 --> 01:53:14,727
Chris, the kids are dying to see you.
It's been nine months. What...?

1492
01:53:22,920 --> 01:53:24,524
I'm coming home.

1493
01:53:25,240 --> 01:53:26,605
<i>Are you all right?</i>

1494
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:28,921
Yeah, I'm good.

1495
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:35,048
Babe, come home. Okay?

1496
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:37,922
You know, we miss you.

1497
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:42,721
Okay.

1498
01:54:23,880 --> 01:54:24,961
Hey, Chris?

1499
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:26,806
Babe.

1500
01:54:34,160 --> 01:54:36,447
Hon, I'm going outside.

1501
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:46,564
- Get it!
- Higher.

1502
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:50,045
Look at you.
I can see your face again, babe.

1503
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:51,645
- Looks good.
- Well, good.

1504
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:53,086
Looks different.

1505
01:54:54,720 --> 01:54:56,643
So the game's this Saturday.

1506
01:54:57,080 --> 01:55:00,880
You know, he's the tallest kid on the team.
Doctor said he could be 6'4".

1507
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:02,406
- Isn't that insane?
- Mm.

1508
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,120
Can't wait for you to see him play. I go
crazy when the other kids jump on him.

1509
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:10,005
I need you there as, like,
a leveler, you know what I mean?

1510
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,042
Hey, maybe you could even coach,
you know?

1511
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:17,691
'Kenna's gonna lose that tooth.

1512
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:20,730
I'm so worried she's gonna swallow it,
like, in her sleep or something.

1513
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:24,851
And she said she'd let you pull it,
but only you. Would you do that?

1514
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:44,086
Chris!

1515
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:02,089
You know, I got a very interesting
phone call. It's from your wife.

1516
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:04,449
She told me about the barbecue.

1517
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:07,770
Yeah, that was unfortunate. Yeah.

1518
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:11,288
Things seem like they got
a little out of hand. Are you worried?

1519
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:12,606
No, sir.

1520
01:56:13,080 --> 01:56:16,402
So you're not worried about what
happened, or what might happen?

1521
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:18,563
No, sir, I'm not worried about that.

1522
01:56:20,280 --> 01:56:22,203
Let me ask you a question, Chris.

1523
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:24,807
How much time did you spend in-country?

1524
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:27,566
Uh, well, four tours, so...

1525
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:29,689
That's like, what, 1000 days?

1526
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:31,445
Yeah, sounds about right.

1527
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:36,650
Would you be surprised if I told you
that the Navy has credited you...

1528
01:56:36,840 --> 01:56:38,763
...with over 160 kills?
- Mm.

1529
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:41,964
Do you ever think...

1530
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:46,923
...that you might have seen things or done
things over there that you wish you hadn't?

1531
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,089
Oh, that's not me. No.

1532
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:51,327
What's not you?

1533
01:56:51,520 --> 01:56:55,241
I was just protecting my guys.
They were trying to kill our soldiers...

1534
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:59,286
...and I'm willing to meet my Creator
and answer for every shot that I took.

1535
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:03,766
The thing...

1536
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:07,731
...that haunts me are all the guys
that I couldn't save.

1537
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:14,248
You know, I'm willing and able
to be there but I'm not. I'm here. I quit.

1538
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:17,963
So you wish you could've
saved more guys?

1539
01:57:19,520 --> 01:57:20,806
Yes, sir.

1540
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:25,768
You know, you can walk down any hall
in this hospital.

1541
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:28,441
We got plenty of soldiers need saving.

1542
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:33,490
Mm-hm.

1543
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:35,651
Wanna take a walk?

1544
01:57:36,160 --> 01:57:37,241
Sure.

1545
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:39,326
All right.

1546
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:41,005
I wanna show you something.

1547
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:49,566
I still smoke, but can't be too mad at it
because it kind of saved my right hand.

1548
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:50,807
How so?

1549
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:54,767
When I got blown up, I had both of my
hands on the bottom of the steering wheel.

1550
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:59,009
And right before the explosion went off,
I took my hand off...

1551
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:01,401
...grabbed a cigarette,
stuck it in my mouth.

1552
01:58:01,560 --> 01:58:04,166
When I went to go light it,
the explosion happened.

1553
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:08,720
And it took the whole bottom of the
steering wheel and my left hand off.

1554
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:10,689
And I was lucky that I had this.

1555
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:13,844
I mean, it still fucked up my right hand,
but...

1556
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:15,525
- Yeah.
- I still got it.

1557
01:58:15,680 --> 01:58:16,841
And you still smoke?

1558
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:18,684
Yeah, I still smoke.

1559
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:27,284
Miss. Three inches to the right.

1560
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:29,522
Come on, Wynn.
You can do better than that.

1561
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:32,691
Bring this to the right.

1562
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:35,769
Make sure you keep both eyes open.

1563
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:37,405
Let that trigger surprise you.

1564
01:58:37,560 --> 01:58:39,881
We're not shooting bad guys,
we're shooting paper.

1565
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:42,122
How about the Legend stops
trying to fuck up my shot?

1566
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:43,520
How about you hit one?

1567
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:46,881
- Hit!
- There you go.

1568
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,326
Bull's-eye, boy.

1569
01:58:48,720 --> 01:58:51,371
Damn, if that don't feel like
I got my balls back.

1570
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:55,607
Why you spending
all this time with us, man?

1571
01:58:55,880 --> 01:58:57,405
I know you got a family.

1572
01:58:57,640 --> 01:59:00,211
I heard you had a boot collection
before the war?

1573
01:59:00,720 --> 01:59:02,484
I saw we were about the same size.

1574
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:04,731
Seriously, man.

1575
01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:06,566
Why do you do it?

1576
01:59:06,720 --> 01:59:08,848
Well, we take care of each other, right?

1577
01:59:09,280 --> 01:59:11,248
Let's see if you can't hit two in a row.

1578
01:59:13,280 --> 01:59:14,884
Come on, man. You got this.

1579
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:18,085
- Hit!
- Nice.

1580
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:23,927
- Hit!
- Whoo!

1581
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:25,241
Goddamn.

1582
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:27,771
Who's the legend now?

1583
01:59:29,480 --> 01:59:31,084
That's a title you don't want.

1584
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:32,447
Trust me.

1585
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:39,800
<i>Yo, will you hop down?
I'll give them to you.</i>

1586
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:45,602
- You got one more?
- Yeah.

1587
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:48,682
- All right, take them inside.
- All right.

1588
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:14,565
Come here. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

1589
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:18,802
It's not a bad life out here, is it?

1590
02:00:18,960 --> 02:00:20,962
Got a smile on his face.

1591
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:23,164
Looks cheery to me.

1592
02:00:23,960 --> 02:00:25,724
Just doing his thing.

1593
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:30,209
Wave goodbye to him.

1594
02:00:39,600 --> 02:00:41,887
Oh! Fuck, who is that?!

1595
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:43,451
Oh, babe, is that you?

1596
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:44,647
Yep-a-doo-dee!

1597
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:46,888
Baby, I fucking hurt myself. Shit.

1598
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:49,327
- What?
- No, I'm all right. I'm all right!

1599
02:00:49,480 --> 02:00:50,891
I'm all right. Fuck.

1600
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:52,405
- Baby, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1601
02:00:52,560 --> 02:00:53,891
What happened?

1602
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:55,166
Don't you...! Ooh!

1603
02:00:57,520 --> 02:01:00,683
You know that it's a heck of thing
to stop a beating heart.

1604
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:02,601
Yeah.

1605
02:01:02,760 --> 02:01:05,684
That's why we're gonna do it together
for your first time.

1606
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,161
All right.

1607
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:10,361
Now remember, you gotta be calm...

1608
02:01:10,680 --> 02:01:12,011
...confident...

1609
02:01:12,680 --> 02:01:14,364
...and you never hesitate.

1610
02:01:15,960 --> 02:01:17,041
All right.

1611
02:01:17,200 --> 02:01:18,929
- You got it, bubba?
- I got it.

1612
02:01:19,120 --> 02:01:20,884
- You feel good?
- Yeah.

1613
02:01:26,360 --> 02:01:27,691
- Shh.
- Shh.

1614
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:39,210
Hands in the air, little lady.

1615
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:41,362
- No way.
- Hands in the air.

1616
02:01:42,720 --> 02:01:44,563
Now, you drop them drawers.

1617
02:01:46,520 --> 02:01:49,410
But you drop them nice and easy.

1618
02:01:50,440 --> 02:01:52,408
Oh, baby, look at you.

1619
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:55,040
Look at you.

1620
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,650
Can I tell you something, Chris?

1621
02:01:57,800 --> 02:02:00,121
- Tell it to the judge.
- Stop it.

1622
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:03,804
No, I am so proud of you,
and I don't tell you enough.

1623
02:02:04,040 --> 02:02:05,087
I'm so proud of you.

1624
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:06,924
You're such a great father.

1625
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:09,924
And I am so happy
that I've got my husband back.

1626
02:02:11,440 --> 02:02:14,250
And I also know how hard you fought
to get here.

1627
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:17,330
You're worth fighting for.

1628
02:02:19,560 --> 02:02:21,289
Now tell me one other thing.

1629
02:02:21,440 --> 02:02:22,930
- Did you pleat those jeans?
- Hm?

1630
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:25,288
Yes, ma'am.
I believe they're right down the middle.

1631
02:02:25,480 --> 02:02:28,927
- Oh, you're just a regular, old cowboy again.
- Mm-hm. That's right. And...

1632
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:32,687
- Why don't you really drop them drawers.
- I'm not wearing any drawers, baby.

1633
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:35,089
I got four minutes.

1634
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:37,124
Ha-ha-ha.
Is that all it takes?

1635
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:38,611
No, it takes two minutes.

1636
02:02:38,760 --> 02:02:41,445
But then I want two minutes to look at you.

1637
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:44,330
Aren't you going to the range?

1638
02:02:45,160 --> 02:02:46,650
Who are you taking out?

1639
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:48,200
This Marine.

1640
02:02:48,360 --> 02:02:49,486
His mama kept asking me.

1641
02:02:49,640 --> 02:02:53,087
She parks cars at the elementary school,
and she said, "Can you help out my son?"

1642
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:56,289
And I just thought today's the only day
I can really do it, so...

1643
02:02:56,440 --> 02:02:58,522
It'll be just a bit of the afternoon.
I'll be back.

1644
02:02:58,720 --> 02:03:00,927
Yes! Ha-ha-ha.

1645
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:03,003
Make sure you keep them drawers...
What's up?

1646
02:03:03,160 --> 02:03:06,369
- Dad, you wanna play "Skylanders"?
- No, I can't play right now.

1647
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:08,570
I'll do it when I get back, boy.

1648
02:03:08,720 --> 02:03:11,883
See you're on Level 8, and that
doesn't work. I gotta be on Level 4.

1649
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:13,684
I wanna win.
You gotta let me win.

1650
02:03:13,840 --> 02:03:14,887
No way!

1651
02:03:15,040 --> 02:03:16,804
- Poke the bear!
- Poke the what?

1652
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:18,644
- Poke the bear!
- Poke the what?!

1653
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:20,605
Poke the bear!

1654
02:03:21,960 --> 02:03:24,884
- No! You're supposed to roar, like, grr!
- Like what?

1655
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:27,162
- Grr!
- Like a beast, right? Like what?

1656
02:03:32,240 --> 02:03:34,322
Ooh. All right, bubba.

1657
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:36,847
- Y'all look after our women, okay?
- Yeah.

1658
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:40,243
Okay. It's a big responsibility.
You up for it?

1659
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:43,205
All right. See you later, baby.

1660
02:03:43,680 --> 02:03:45,523
- I love you.
- Love you back.

1661
02:03:52,040 --> 02:03:53,769
- How are you? You good?
- Good.

1662
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:55,809
We're gonna go about a two-hour drive...

1663
02:03:55,960 --> 02:03:59,169
...shoot some guns, maybe have
a little conversation along the way.

1664
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:00,807
All right. Let's go.

1665
02:04:01,480 --> 02:04:02,527
Thank you.
