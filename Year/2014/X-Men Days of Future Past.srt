00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,090
New York City

3
00:01:14,564 --> 00:01:15,555
the future.

4
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:19,189
A dark desolate world.

5
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:30,877
World in war suffering loss ..

6
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:33,284
.. On both sides.

7
00:01:34,823 --> 00:01:38,864
Mutants and the humans who dared help them

8
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:46,273
fighting an enemy we can not defeat.

9
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:16,010
Are we destined on this path?

10
00:02:16,882 --> 00:02:21,547
Destined to destroy ourselves
like so many species before us?

11
00:02:25,424 --> 00:02:29,955
Or can we evolve fast
enough to change ourselves?

12
00:02:30,155 --> 00:02:32,140
Change our fate?

13
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:41,207
Is the future truly set?

14
00:04:10,457 --> 00:04:12,045
They are here!

15
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:18,468
Time's-up !

16
00:04:18,688 --> 00:04:19,575
Sentinel!

17
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:24,760
Sunspot.

18
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:30,799
Let's go!

19
00:07:00,657 --> 00:07:01,387
Blink!

20
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:02,512
No!

21
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:50,886
It's too late
assholes !

22
00:08:11,777 --> 00:08:12,611
<i>Come here!</i>

23
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,373
<i>Get your hands up!!</i>

24
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:16,729
<i>-Get down !!
-No!!!</i>

25
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:20,405
<i>No !!!</i>

26
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:27,962
So few of us left.

27
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:32,301
<i> Professor. </i>

28
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:35,015
We found them.

29
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,823
Professor.

30
00:10:10,406 --> 00:10:11,705
-Bobby.
-Hi storm.

31
00:10:12,787 --> 00:10:13,343
Hey kid.

32
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:15,539
<i> Professor. </i>

33
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:17,842
You made it.

34
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:30,637
Whenever the sentinels attack

35
00:10:30,793 --> 00:10:32,066
warpath spots them.

36
00:10:32,683 --> 00:10:35,207
And I sent bishop back to
warn us of the attack...

37
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:36,319
Before it happens.

38
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:38,974
Blink scouts the next side and..

39
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:41,887
.. Well then we leave before
they ever know we were there.

40
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,617
Because we never were.

41
00:10:45,106 --> 00:10:46,657
What do you mean you've never there?

42
00:10:46,983 --> 00:10:49,312
She projects bishop back
in time few days...

43
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:51,359
To warn the others of the coming attack.

44
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,997
She sends bishop back in time?

45
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:56,934
No just his consciousness
in to his younger-self

46
00:10:57,201 --> 00:10:58,597
into his younger body.

47
00:10:59,373 --> 00:10:59,959
Wow!

48
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:03,319
This not just work Charles.

49
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:06,089
What might works?

50
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:12,016
The sentinel program was originally
conceived by Dr. bolivar trask.

51
00:11:12,384 --> 00:11:16,381
In the early 70s he was one of the
world leading weapons designers.

52
00:11:16,602 --> 00:11:20,996
But covertly he had began
experimenting only mutants.

53
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:25,179
Using their gifts to fuel his own research.

54
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:29,250
There was one mutant who had
discovered what he was doing.

55
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:34,606
Mutant with ability to
transform herself to anyone.

56
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:36,287
Mystique.

57
00:11:37,707 --> 00:11:38,952
I knew her as raven.

58
00:11:39,754 --> 00:11:42,450
We met when we were children
grow up together.

59
00:11:43,842 --> 00:11:45,717
She was like a sister to me.

60
00:11:46,133 --> 00:11:47,683
I tried to help her.

61
00:11:48,047 --> 00:11:50,486
But only succeeded in driving her away.

62
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:54,725
She hunted trask across the world.

63
00:11:55,356 --> 00:12:00,486
And at the Paris peace of accords in 1973
after the Vietnam war.

64
00:12:00,822 --> 00:12:02,442
<i> She found trask</i>

65
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:06,665
and killed him.

66
00:12:13,118 --> 00:12:14,830
It was the first time she killed him.

67
00:12:14,963 --> 00:12:15,885
Wasn't no last.

68
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:20,167
But killing trask did not have
the outcome she expected.

69
00:12:20,418 --> 00:12:24,502
It only persuaded the government
the need for his program.

70
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:26,651
They captured her that day.

71
00:12:27,427 --> 00:12:30,391
Tortured her and experimented on her.

72
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:35,491
In her DNA they discovered the secret
to her power of transformation

73
00:12:35,663 --> 00:12:37,761
it gave them the key they needed

74
00:12:37,762 --> 00:12:41,823
to create weapons that could
adapt to any mutant's power.

75
00:12:42,336 --> 00:12:44,017
And less than 50 years

76
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:49,213
the machines were destroyed so
many of our kind were created.

77
00:12:50,349 --> 00:12:53,818
And it all started that day in 1973

78
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:56,287
the day she first killed

79
00:12:56,487 --> 00:12:59,676
<i> the day she truly became mystique. </i>

80
00:13:01,885 --> 00:13:03,049
Do you wanna go back there?

81
00:13:03,431 --> 00:13:06,627
If I can get to her
stop the assassination

82
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:08,388
keep her out of their hands

83
00:13:08,557 --> 00:13:11,938
and we can stop the sentinels
ever been borne.

84
00:13:12,165 --> 00:13:15,009
And end this war
before it ever begins.

85
00:13:19,452 --> 00:13:21,851
I can send someone back in couple of weeks.

86
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:26,955
Maybe a month but you're talking
about going back decades.

87
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:30,606
You have the most powerful brain the world
professor.

88
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,861
<i> But the mind can only stretch
so far before it snaps.</i>

89
00:13:35,373 --> 00:13:37,956
<i>It will rip you apart. I'm sorry. </i>

90
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,279
<i> No one can survive that trip. </i>

91
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:44,059
What if someone's mind has a
way of sniping back.

92
00:13:45,677 --> 00:13:48,327
What if someone can heal as
faster as rip apart.

93
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:15,147
<i>Okay spread out. </i>

94
00:14:15,435 --> 00:14:16,660
<i> Take you position.</i>

95
00:14:31,514 --> 00:14:34,922
So I wake up in the my younger
body god knows where then what?

96
00:14:35,486 --> 00:14:38,339
You need to go to my house and find me

97
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:41,308
convince me all of this.

98
00:14:41,428 --> 00:14:43,030
Wouldn't you just be able to read my mind?

99
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:46,000
I didn't have my powers in 1973.

100
00:14:46,501 --> 00:14:50,695
Logan you have to do for
me what I once did for you

101
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:53,150
lead me guide me.

102
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:56,188
I was a very difference man then.

103
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,234
You have to be patient with me.

104
00:14:59,385 --> 00:15:01,320
Patience isn't my strongest suit.

105
00:15:02,186 --> 00:15:03,633
You're need me as well.

106
00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:04,450
What?

107
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:06,967
After mystique left Charles
she came with me

108
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,138
and I set her on a dangerous path.

109
00:15:11,071 --> 00:15:11,871
Darker path.

110
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:14,569
It's going to take the
two of us side by side

111
00:15:14,582 --> 00:15:17,090
at a time when we couldn't
be further apart.

112
00:15:21,073 --> 00:15:21,899
Great.

113
00:15:23,327 --> 00:15:24,372
So where do I find you?

114
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:26,317
Oh..Its complicated.

115
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:33,514
Basically your body goes to sleep
only your mind travels back in time.

116
00:15:33,992 --> 00:15:37,281
As long as you back there past and present
will continue to coexist.

117
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:40,157
But once you wake up....

118
00:15:41,584 --> 00:15:44,150
.. Whatever you've done will
take hold and become history.

119
00:15:44,545 --> 00:15:47,069
And for the rest of us that will
be the only history that we know.

120
00:15:47,277 --> 00:15:50,096
That will be like
last 50 years never happened.

121
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,567
This world
this war.

122
00:15:54,023 --> 00:15:56,071
The only person who'll remember it

123
00:15:56,228 --> 00:15:57,228
...is you.

124
00:15:59,072 --> 00:16:03,440
Alright Logan I need you to clear your
head and stay as calm as possible.

125
00:16:03,487 --> 00:16:04,463
What do you mean?

126
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,507
If your mind gets rocky
it will harder for me to hold you.

127
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:09,602
You could start to slip
between past and future.

128
00:16:09,855 --> 00:16:11,724
What I need to get a little rocky ?

129
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:14,291
Think peaceful thoughts.

130
00:16:14,738 --> 00:16:15,770
Peaceful thoughts.

131
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:17,328
Do you have any good news?

132
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:18,032
Well

133
00:16:19,016 --> 00:16:21,668
you don't really age so you'll
pretty much look the same.

134
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:24,151
You don't have much time in past.

135
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:27,138
Sentinels will find us
they always do.

136
00:16:27,338 --> 00:16:30,873
And this time we won't
be able to run or have no escape.

137
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:33,675
This is our last chance.

138
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:36,560
Do you really think this will work?

139
00:16:36,967 --> 00:16:38,340
I have faith in him.

140
00:16:39,185 --> 00:16:41,199
So do him right about his choice.

141
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:43,893
If he is young
it would be no any better.

142
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:45,905
We'll know.

143
00:16:48,357 --> 00:16:50,150
See you soon.

144
00:16:50,314 --> 00:16:52,401
It might sting a little.

145
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:30,139
Holy shit !!

146
00:18:36,673 --> 00:18:38,327
It worked.

147
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:45,077
Hey what's going on ?

148
00:18:45,522 --> 00:18:47,076
-Gwen! Get dressed!
-Who are you?

149
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:48,356
Hey I don't know what's going on.

150
00:18:48,398 --> 00:18:51,591
What's going on is you supposed to guard
your boss's daughter not screwing her.

151
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:53,485
I didn't sleep with her.

152
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,842
-No?
-No.

153
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,592
I mean yes
I slept with her many times but...

154
00:18:58,632 --> 00:18:59,350
Jimmy!

155
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:01,748
That wasn't me. That was old me.

156
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:05,535
-I just got here like 20 seconds ago.
-Really?

157
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,150
-Yeah.
-What happen to your cloths?

158
00:19:07,197 --> 00:19:08,390
No...Oh..

159
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,543
Will you believe me if I told you
I've sent here from the future?

160
00:19:15,262 --> 00:19:16,489
-Get out of here sweetheart.
-Yeah

161
00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:17,845
we'll take care of this comedian.

162
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:18,534
No you not.

163
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:20,787
You gonna give me the keys of
your car and money for gas

164
00:19:21,015 --> 00:19:22,444
or you gonna wake up in a hospital.

165
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:24,144
Trust me I know how these things pay out.

166
00:19:24,376 --> 00:19:26,557
-Because you from the future?
-No

167
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,059
...because of these.

168
00:19:30,717 --> 00:19:32,046
What the hell!!

169
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:38,829
Ahhh...Damn it.

170
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:00,642
Peaceful thoughts.

171
00:20:16,664 --> 00:20:19,385
<i> We are reviewing all of
our defense expenditures</i>

172
00:20:19,476 --> 00:20:21,565
<i> and all the black books are being opened. </i>

173
00:20:21,765 --> 00:20:25,368
<i> We can't support a weapon that
targets our own citizens </i>

174
00:20:25,568 --> 00:20:27,778
if these mutants as you described

175
00:20:27,904 --> 00:20:31,648
already living among us
then they are living here peacefully.

176
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,424
We haven't had an
incident in over 10 years.

177
00:20:33,437 --> 00:20:35,099
After what happened in Cuba?

178
00:20:35,224 --> 00:20:36,530
It was never confirmed.

179
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:38,816
We have real enemies out there.

180
00:20:38,817 --> 00:20:40,497
Russians
the Chinese.

181
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:45,503
We're talking about 10 of 10 of the 10
of our population.

182
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,169
-Allow me to read something to you.
-Please.

183
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:52,404
This was acquired by our
friends at the CIA.

184
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,723
Its in a dissertation

185
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:57,389
written by a mutant
at Oxford university.

186
00:20:58,505 --> 00:20:59,272
And I quote.

187
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:04,666
<i>To homo-neanderthals his a
mutant cousin of homo saphiens
</i>

188
00:21:05,037 --> 00:21:06,154
<i>which is us.</i>

189
00:21:06,506 --> 00:21:07,837
Was an aberration

190
00:21:08,204 --> 00:21:11,912
the arrival of mutated human
species: Homo saphiens.

191
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:16,130
Was followed by the immediate extinction
of the their less evolve kin.

192
00:21:16,863 --> 00:21:17,357
Well

193
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,444
now..

194
00:21:20,428 --> 00:21:22,569
We are the <i> neanderthals.</i>

195
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:24,832
Speak for yourself
Dr.. Trask.

196
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:29,414
<i> You know when you send
our soldiers to Vietnam</i>

197
00:21:29,427 --> 00:21:31,697
<i>without the weapon they
needed to win the war</i>

198
00:21:31,739 --> 00:21:33,708
<i> you underestimated your enemy. </i>

199
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:36,244
You hah you do that with this enemy

200
00:21:38,484 --> 00:21:41,413
it won't be some border skirmish
halfway around the world.

201
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:45,297
<i> This time the war will be for our
streets our cities
our homes.</i>

202
00:21:46,008 --> 00:21:49,210
And by the time you see
the need for my program

203
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:51,933
it will be too late.

204
00:21:53,088 --> 00:21:56,729
And you will have lost two
wars in one life time.

205
00:22:00,648 --> 00:22:02,357
We're sorry
Dr.. Trask.

206
00:22:03,061 --> 00:22:04,880
But your sentinel program

207
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:07,279
it ain't gonna fly.

208
00:22:19,803 --> 00:22:21,545
Can I help you colonel?

209
00:22:22,248 --> 00:22:24,405
Just here to give my
boys to proper send off.

210
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:27,837
I'm sorry sir. But we have orders.
This is a quarantined area.

211
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,741
Stand a side soldier.
That's an order.

212
00:22:40,764 --> 00:22:42,579
Attention.

213
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,668
At ease.

214
00:23:08,072 --> 00:23:09,094
What is all this?

215
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:12,571
Lab reports blood tests. All are
getting packed up and send back.

216
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:13,853
Where is it going?

217
00:23:14,089 --> 00:23:15,253
Same place as they are.

218
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:16,862
Trask industries.

219
00:23:18,593 --> 00:23:20,085
Lets go gentleman

220
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:21,883
taking you out of this shit show.

221
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,884
Shipping home?

222
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:26,639
Not just yet.

223
00:23:27,996 --> 00:23:29,128
What do you doing with those?

224
00:23:29,255 --> 00:23:30,825
Its only make the ride little smoother.

225
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:33,756
We are transferring you to a
private facility where we can..

226
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,177
Run a few more tests.

227
00:23:41,492 --> 00:23:42,712
Your men are not military.

228
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:47,643
Private outfit.
We're authorized to command these men.

229
00:23:51,558 --> 00:23:53,321
These troops are going home.

230
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:54,803
Well
colonel...

231
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:57,130
I don't believe you have the
jurisdiction in this matter.

232
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,326
I'm afraid I do it son.

233
00:24:01,334 --> 00:24:02,780
I'm sorry who are you?

234
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:04,741
The question is major.

235
00:24:09,071 --> 00:24:10,048
Who are you?

236
00:24:55,775 --> 00:24:56,474
Raven.

237
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,382
That's not my name.

238
00:25:04,983 --> 00:25:06,961
-I had him.
-I know.

239
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:10,750
Let's move out.
Com-on let's go.

240
00:25:11,024 --> 00:25:12,357
Where's Erik?

241
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:13,911
I'm on my own now.

242
00:25:17,135 --> 00:25:18,093
Let's go. Move it.

243
00:25:35,796 --> 00:25:37,125
Hold that plane!

244
00:25:37,832 --> 00:25:41,004
I wanna leave these boys in this
godforsaken country

245
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:41,880
let's go.

246
00:25:42,672 --> 00:25:44,477
You're not coming with us are you?

247
00:25:44,913 --> 00:25:48,234
My war is not over.
The enemy is still out there.

248
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,297
Where did they go?

249
00:26:12,497 --> 00:26:13,733
Four cadets where they go?

250
00:26:13,844 --> 00:26:15,150
They went over there.

251
00:26:35,876 --> 00:26:40,316
Private property keep out

252
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:46,318
Xavier's school

253
00:27:14,714 --> 00:27:15,495
can I help you?

254
00:27:16,307 --> 00:27:18,238
Ahh yeah what happened to the school?

255
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,348
School has been shut for years.

256
00:27:20,669 --> 00:27:21,763
Are you a parent?

257
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:23,349
Sure as hell hope not.

258
00:27:23,739 --> 00:27:25,677
-Who are you?
-I'm Hank.

259
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,921
I and maccoy look
after the house now.

260
00:27:29,766 --> 00:27:30,625
You are beast?

261
00:27:31,306 --> 00:27:33,339
Look at you
guess you are a late bloomer.

262
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:36,652
I do not know what you're talking about.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

263
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:39,692
-Where is the professor?
-There is no professor here.

264
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:41,632
You're pretty strong for a scrawny kid.

265
00:27:42,631 --> 00:27:44,521
Sure there is no beast thing here?

266
00:27:44,782 --> 00:27:46,080
-Come on beast.
-Beast is not here.

267
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,267
-Come on beasty.
-Go!

268
00:27:48,298 --> 00:27:49,626
Hey!!

269
00:27:50,657 --> 00:27:52,970
I said the school is closed.
You need to leave.

270
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,416
Not until I see the professor.

271
00:27:54,588 --> 00:27:56,600
There is no professor here.
I told you that.

272
00:27:57,067 --> 00:28:00,788
Look kid.
You and I gonna be good friends.

273
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,983
You just don't know what yet.

274
00:28:07,365 --> 00:28:08,227
Professor!

275
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:10,494
Ahhh.....

276
00:28:15,148 --> 00:28:16,180
Professor!

277
00:28:31,812 --> 00:28:34,360
Hank what's going on here?

278
00:28:36,618 --> 00:28:38,713
-Professor.
-Please do not call me that.

279
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:40,378
Do you know this guy?

280
00:28:40,534 --> 00:28:42,918
Yeah he looks slightly familiar

281
00:28:43,004 --> 00:28:44,707
get off the bloody chandelier Hank.

282
00:28:47,414 --> 00:28:48,000
You can walk.

283
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:49,520
You're a perceptive one.

284
00:28:49,612 --> 00:28:50,546
I thought Erik ..

285
00:28:50,746 --> 00:28:53,867
What you saying managed to
miss our sign on the way in

286
00:28:53,977 --> 00:28:58,088
this is private property my friend
I'm gonna ask him to ask you to leave.

287
00:28:59,733 --> 00:29:02,159
Well I'm afraid I can't do that because...

288
00:29:04,182 --> 00:29:05,486
..Because I was sent here for you

289
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:09,175
well tell whoever it was
that sent you that I'm busy.

290
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:13,649
This gonna be a little tricky
because the person who sent me..

291
00:29:14,109 --> 00:29:14,891
Was you.

292
00:29:15,091 --> 00:29:17,228
-What?
-About 50 years from now.

293
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:20,280
50 years from now like in the
future 50 years from now.

294
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:20,561
Yeah.

295
00:29:20,685 --> 00:29:22,458
-I sent you from the future.
-Yeah.

296
00:29:23,193 --> 00:29:23,924
Piss off.

297
00:29:25,624 --> 00:29:27,698
If you had your powers
you know I was telling the truth.

298
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,797
How do you know I don't have my.....

299
00:29:31,156 --> 00:29:32,712
-Who are you?
-I told you.

300
00:29:32,797 --> 00:29:34,298
-You are CIA?
-No.

301
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,263
You were watching me.

302
00:29:35,304 --> 00:29:36,342
I know you Charles.

303
00:29:37,116 --> 00:29:38,750
We've been friends for years.

304
00:29:39,265 --> 00:29:41,720
I know your powers came when you were 9.

305
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:44,395
I know you thought you
were going crazy when

306
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,524
it started all the
voices in your head.

307
00:29:46,642 --> 00:29:48,771
And it wasn't until you
were 12 that you realized

308
00:29:48,784 --> 00:29:50,924
all the voices were in
everyone else's head.

309
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:52,862
Do you want me to go on?

310
00:29:55,304 --> 00:29:56,492
I never told that anyone.

311
00:29:56,676 --> 00:29:59,528
Not yet no but you'll.

312
00:30:01,611 --> 00:30:04,018
Alright you've picked my interest
what do you want?

313
00:30:04,786 --> 00:30:06,755
We have to stop raven.

314
00:30:08,825 --> 00:30:10,793
I need your help.

315
00:30:11,763 --> 00:30:13,379
We need your help.

316
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,398
Think I'd like to wake up now.

317
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,365
What does she have to do with this?

318
00:30:30,888 --> 00:30:34,916
So you're saying that they
took raven's power and what?

319
00:30:35,695 --> 00:30:38,179
They weaponized it?

320
00:30:38,384 --> 00:30:39,171
Yep

321
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:41,388
she is unique.

322
00:30:41,828 --> 00:30:43,164
Yes she is.

323
00:30:43,771 --> 00:30:46,992
In the beginning the sentinels
were just targeting mutants.

324
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:49,904
Then they began to identify
the genetics in non-mutants.

325
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,676
Who would eventually have mutant
children or grandchildren

326
00:30:55,043 --> 00:30:58,004
many of the humans tried to help us
it was a slaughter

327
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,688
leaving only the worst
of humanity in charge

328
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:03,118
but then it went worse.

329
00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:06,990
I've never seen anything like this.

330
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:09,749
And it all starts with her.

331
00:31:09,959 --> 00:31:12,809
Let's just say that for the sake of

332
00:31:13,023 --> 00:31:16,989
sake that I choose to believe you
that I choose to help you.

333
00:31:17,244 --> 00:31:18,944
Raven won't listen to me.

334
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:24,818
No her heart and soul belongs
to someone else now.

335
00:31:25,595 --> 00:31:26,355
I know.

336
00:31:28,604 --> 00:31:30,393
That's why we gonna need Magneto too.

337
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,410
Erik?

338
00:31:33,777 --> 00:31:34,882
You do know where he is?

339
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:35,965
Yeah.

340
00:31:42,155 --> 00:31:43,384
He's where he belongs.

341
00:31:44,647 --> 00:31:45,952
So that's it
you're just gonna walk out?

342
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,532
Oh top marks like I said
you are perceptive.

343
00:31:48,812 --> 00:31:50,562
The professor I know would
never turn his back

344
00:31:50,645 --> 00:31:52,080
..on someone who lost their path

345
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,258
especially someone he loved.

346
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,136
You know..

347
00:31:58,776 --> 00:32:00,399
I think I do remember you now.

348
00:32:01,162 --> 00:32:04,625
Yeah we came to you a long
time ago seeking your help.

349
00:32:05,998 --> 00:32:08,642
And I'm gonna say to you
what you said to us then

350
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:12,351
fuck off!

351
00:32:12,853 --> 00:32:15,969
Listen to me you little shit
I've come a long way

352
00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:18,619
and I watched a lot of people die
good people friends.

353
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,174
If you're gonna wallow in
self pity and do nothing

354
00:32:22,326 --> 00:32:24,496
then you're gonna watch the same thing
you understand?

355
00:32:29,885 --> 00:32:31,371
We all have to die some time.

356
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:38,719
I told you there is
no professor here.

357
00:32:40,672 --> 00:32:41,818
What the hell happened to him?

358
00:32:46,908 --> 00:32:52,742
<i> He lost everything.
Erik, raven, his legs. </i>

359
00:32:53,078 --> 00:32:56,975
The school allowed us this whole place

360
00:32:57,528 --> 00:32:59,377
just after the first semester

361
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:02,152
the war in Vietnam got worse.

362
00:33:03,143 --> 00:33:06,839
Many of the teachers and
students were drafted.

363
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:08,850
It really broke him.

364
00:33:09,831 --> 00:33:11,362
<i> He retreated into himself.. </i>

365
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,147
<i>I wanted to help do something so.. </i>

366
00:33:14,687 --> 00:33:16,434
<i> So I designed a serum to
treat his spine</i>

367
00:33:16,601 --> 00:33:20,853
<i> derived from the same formula that
helps me control my mutation. </i>

368
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:24,558
I take just enough to
keep myself balanced but

369
00:33:25,854 --> 00:33:27,653
he takes too much.

370
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:31,983
I tried easing him back but he
just couldn't bear the pain

371
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:33,317
voices..

372
00:33:34,483 --> 00:33:36,454
The treatment gives
him him his legs but

373
00:33:37,374 --> 00:33:38,467
it's not enough

374
00:33:39,422 --> 00:33:40,290
he's..

375
00:33:42,886 --> 00:33:44,821
He's just lost too much.

376
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:00,660
<i> You're not scare to me? </i>

377
00:34:01,189 --> 00:34:04,182
<i>I always believed I couldn't be
the only one in the world.</i>

378
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,095
<i> Charles Xavier. </i>

379
00:34:09,133 --> 00:34:09,712
Raven .

380
00:34:11,368 --> 00:34:13,688
You're hungry and alone?

381
00:34:14,072 --> 00:34:15,126
Take whatever you want.

382
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:17,477
We got lots of food
you don't have to steal. .

383
00:34:19,213 --> 00:34:22,502
In-fact you never have to steal again.

384
00:34:23,427 --> 00:34:25,210
<i>And that's a promise. </i>

385
00:34:30,837 --> 00:34:32,201
I hope you get her.

386
00:34:34,643 --> 00:34:37,744
But not for any of your
future shots but for her .

387
00:34:37,986 --> 00:34:38,799
Fare enough.

388
00:34:40,642 --> 00:34:42,634
I'm telling you this
you do not know Erik.

389
00:34:42,939 --> 00:34:45,135
The man is a monster.
A murderer.

390
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,946
You think you can convince raven to change?

391
00:34:48,383 --> 00:34:49,239
To come home?

392
00:34:49,774 --> 00:34:50,858
Splendid.

393
00:34:52,118 --> 00:34:54,952
But what makes you think
you can change the him?

394
00:34:55,022 --> 00:34:57,890
Because you and Erik
sent me here back together.

395
00:35:01,197 --> 00:35:03,569
The room they're holding him
in was built during the

396
00:35:03,582 --> 00:35:05,965
2nd world war when there
was a shortage of steel

397
00:35:06,036 --> 00:35:09,640
so the foundation is pure
concrete and sand no metal.

398
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:13,431
And he's being held a 100
floors beneath the most

399
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:15,921
heavily guarded building on the planet.

400
00:35:16,083 --> 00:35:17,072
Why is he in there?

401
00:35:19,061 --> 00:35:20,429
What he forgot to mention?

402
00:35:22,368 --> 00:35:23,467
Ahhh jfk.

403
00:35:23,823 --> 00:35:25,210
He killed him?

404
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:29,535
What else would explain the bullet
miraculously curving through the air

405
00:35:29,678 --> 00:35:31,453
Eric's always had a way with guns.

406
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:33,607
Are you sure you want
to carry on with this?

407
00:35:33,807 --> 00:35:35,206
This is your plan
not mine.

408
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:38,188
We don't have any resources
to get us in or out

409
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,814
it's just me and Hank.

410
00:35:41,337 --> 00:35:42,313
I know a guy.

411
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:45,547
Yeah he'd be a young man now
grew up outside of DC

412
00:35:47,258 --> 00:35:49,318
he could get into anywhere

413
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:51,630
just don't know how the
hell we're gonna find him

414
00:35:53,638 --> 00:35:55,630
history provided the question

415
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,806
we have a phone book

416
00:36:06,891 --> 00:36:09,381
I thought you'd be getting
ready for your trip sir.

417
00:36:09,694 --> 00:36:11,545
I just came to grab couple of files.

418
00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:13,130
Is that a new scarf?

419
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:14,980
It's nice.

420
00:36:15,582 --> 00:36:16,341
Thank you.

421
00:37:22,576 --> 00:37:24,713
Autopsy reports

422
00:37:48,221 --> 00:37:49,124
Dr. trask.

423
00:37:49,205 --> 00:37:50,084
One second.

424
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:54,696
We added some names to the Paris meeting

425
00:37:58,281 --> 00:37:59,270
thank you.

426
00:38:00,742 --> 00:38:02,559
Is there something wrong
sir?

427
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:04,005
No.

428
00:38:04,778 --> 00:38:05,434
It's nothing.

429
00:38:05,806 --> 00:38:07,809
Would you mind typing up my itinerary.

430
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,104
I don't wanna miss anything.

431
00:38:42,242 --> 00:38:43,559
What has he done now?

432
00:38:43,649 --> 00:38:45,041
I'll just write you a check
for whatever he took.

433
00:38:45,054 --> 00:38:46,456
We just need talk to him.

434
00:38:48,906 --> 00:38:52,129
Peter the cops are here..

435
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,400
.. Again.

436
00:39:00,833 --> 00:39:03,028
Guess what I didn't do anything

437
00:39:03,228 --> 00:39:03,950
I've been here all day.

438
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:07,691
Just relax Peter
we are not cops.

439
00:39:07,852 --> 00:39:09,931
Of course you're not cops if you were
cops you wouldn't drive a rental car

440
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,332
how'd you know we got a rental car?

441
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:13,078
I checked your registration when you
were walking through the door

442
00:39:13,346 --> 00:39:14,786
I also had some time to
kill so I went through your

443
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:16,250
rental agreements saw you
were from out of town

444
00:39:16,512 --> 00:39:17,536
are you FBI?

445
00:39:18,465 --> 00:39:21,636
No you're not cops
hey what's up with this kid's school place

446
00:39:22,172 --> 00:39:23,943
that's an old card.

447
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:26,448
He is fascinating he
is a pain in the ass.

448
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:27,434
What teleporter?

449
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:28,771
No he's just fast.

450
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:31,820
When I know him he was so old. Young.

451
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:33,728
Young?
You're just old.

452
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,734
So you're not afraid to show your powers?

453
00:39:37,165 --> 00:39:38,818
Power? What power?
What you talking about?

454
00:39:39,524 --> 00:39:40,830
You see some strange here?

455
00:39:42,226 --> 00:39:44,508
Nothing anybody believe if you told them.

456
00:39:48,264 --> 00:39:49,627
So who are you?
What do you want?

457
00:39:49,827 --> 00:39:50,961
We need your help Peter.

458
00:39:51,053 --> 00:39:51,659
What?

459
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:54,483
Break into a highly secured facility

460
00:39:54,551 --> 00:39:55,720
and get someone out.

461
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,602
Prison break?

462
00:39:57,588 --> 00:39:59,420
That's illegal you know.

463
00:40:03,225 --> 00:40:04,419
Well only if you get caught.

464
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:05,954
What's there in for me?

465
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:09,498
You the kleptomaniac
get to break into the Pentagon.

466
00:40:15,537 --> 00:40:16,859
How do I know I can trust you?

467
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:19,444
Because we are just like you.

468
00:40:21,826 --> 00:40:22,885
Show him.

469
00:40:34,898 --> 00:40:36,212
It's cool just disgusting

470
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:42,939
built in 1943 the Pentagon is the
world largest office building.

471
00:40:43,111 --> 00:40:48,138
Housing more than 25000 military and police
stretched over 6 million square feet.

472
00:40:48,338 --> 00:40:51,918
Where is the bathroom?
<i>I need to pee. </i>

473
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:53,752
Well lucky for you
you have...

474
00:41:18,938 --> 00:41:20,000
Thank you.

475
00:41:21,671 --> 00:41:23,556
No metal beyond this point.

476
00:41:55,256 --> 00:41:57,730
Yeah we getting broadcast signal down here?
What's going on?

477
00:41:57,792 --> 00:41:59,417
Damn it !! Call the maintenance
get them down here.

478
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,140
Mind the glass

479
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:40,444
<i>....from a Japanese empire.</i>

480
00:43:40,806 --> 00:43:42,371
<i>This month long battle...</i>

481
00:43:42,447 --> 00:43:45,744
<i>Included some of the fearsome
fighting during world war ii</i>

482
00:44:01,511 --> 00:44:03,669
in 3 seconds those doors are going to open

483
00:44:04,038 --> 00:44:06,369
and 20 guards will be here to shoot us.

484
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:08,956
I know that's what I'm waiting for

485
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:10,183
what are you doing?

486
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:12,130
I'm holding your neck so
you won't get whip-lash

487
00:44:12,285 --> 00:44:12,832
what?

488
00:44:13,032 --> 00:44:15,663
Whip.....La..Sh

489
00:44:20,238 --> 00:44:20,966
they're in.

490
00:44:36,139 --> 00:44:37,664
You're good. It'll pass.

491
00:44:37,844 --> 00:44:39,564
It happens when I run.

492
00:44:41,273 --> 00:44:42,766
Must have done something pretty serious.

493
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:46,054
What're you do man?
What you do.

494
00:44:46,254 --> 00:44:48,553
What're you do?
Why would they have you in there.

495
00:44:48,688 --> 00:44:49,688
For killing the president.

496
00:44:55,166 --> 00:44:58,365
Anything I'm guilty of is fighting
for people like us

497
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:00,580
you take karate?
You're a karate man?

498
00:45:00,752 --> 00:45:02,274
I don't know karate.

499
00:45:02,929 --> 00:45:03,937
I know crazy.

500
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:08,378
Ladies and gentlemen boys and girls
this is a code red situation

501
00:45:08,398 --> 00:45:13,845
we are evacuating the entire floor so
that we my uh associate and I can uh

502
00:45:13,939 --> 00:45:15,184
- secure the prisoner.
- Who are you?

503
00:45:15,253 --> 00:45:20,073
We are special operations
cb fe cied look

504
00:45:20,127 --> 00:45:22,184
perhaps you didn't hear
me what first I spoke

505
00:45:22,245 --> 00:45:25,686
it's imperative that you understand
we're in complete lock down situation.

506
00:45:25,901 --> 00:45:27,455
We have to get in to the 3rd floor

507
00:45:34,836 --> 00:45:36,287
oh I'm sorry
you want to finish?

508
00:45:41,922 --> 00:45:43,556
They told me you can control the metal.

509
00:45:44,092 --> 00:45:44,614
They?

510
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,133
You know my mom once knew a
guy who could do that.

511
00:45:53,627 --> 00:45:56,829
Sorry I'm just not very
good with violence.

512
00:45:59,912 --> 00:46:00,693
Charles.

513
00:46:07,646 --> 00:46:09,614
Good to see you too old friend.

514
00:46:09,681 --> 00:46:12,365
-And walking?
-Not thanks to you.

515
00:46:14,362 --> 00:46:16,840
You're the last person in the
world I expected to see today.

516
00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:20,190
Believe me I wouldn’t
be here if I didn't have to.

517
00:46:20,649 --> 00:46:22,437
If we get you out of here we do it my way

518
00:46:22,622 --> 00:46:23,533
no killing.

519
00:46:23,733 --> 00:46:24,622
No helmet.

520
00:46:25,386 --> 00:46:27,245
I couldn't disobey you even if I want to.

521
00:46:27,578 --> 00:46:30,160
I'm never getting inside
of that head again.

522
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:33,239
I need your word Erik.

523
00:46:36,834 --> 00:46:37,970
No body move!

524
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,945
Move it right there!

525
00:46:42,385 --> 00:46:43,503
Charles.
<i> Don't move! </i>

526
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:46,572
Hands up or we'll shoot!

527
00:46:46,615 --> 00:46:47,900
-Freeze them Charles.
-I can't.

528
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:48,850
Hands up!

529
00:46:54,453 --> 00:46:54,662
No!

530

00:47:29,644 --> 00:47:34,036
<font color=#ffff00>♪ If I could make days last forever...</font>

535
00:47:34,731 --> 00:47:38,632
<font color=#ffff00>♪ If words could make wishes come true..</font>

536
00:47:39,913 --> 00:47:45,010
<font color=#ffff00>♪ I'd save every day like
a treasure and then..</font>

537
00:47:45,441 --> 00:47:49,394
<font color=#ffff00>♪ Again
I would spend them with you..</font>

538
00:47:50,522 --> 00:47:53,591
<font color=#ffff00>♪ But there never seems to be enough time..</font>

539
00:47:53,711 --> 00:47:57,884
<font color=#ffff00>♪ To do the things you want
to do once you find them..</font>

540
00:48:01,974 --> 00:48:04,492
<font color=#ffff00>♪ I've looked around enough to know..</font>

541
00:48:04,608 --> 00:48:08,282
<font color=#ffff00>♪ That you're the one I want
to go through time with..</font>

542
00:48:48,299 --> 00:48:49,288
Thanks kid.

543
00:48:54,537 --> 00:48:56,701
Peter thank you very very much.

544
00:48:57,072 --> 00:48:57,956
You take care.

545
00:48:58,008 --> 00:49:00,170
Yeah safe flight man *****
why you want to go Paris?

546
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:13,533
Imagine if they made of metal.

547
00:49:15,166 --> 00:49:16,940
Do me a favor and return it for me okay.

548
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:17,848
Peter...

549
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,818
Take it slowly.

550
00:49:21,315 --> 00:49:22,670
Where did they dig you up?

551
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:27,102
You're gonna find this hard to believe
but ahh..

552
00:49:27,852 --> 00:49:29,121
You sent me.

553
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:31,435
You and Charles

554
00:49:31,981 --> 00:49:33,270
from the future.

555
00:49:56,238 --> 00:49:57,254
How did you lose them?

556
00:49:58,566 --> 00:50:00,763
The treatment for my spine fixed my DNA.

557
00:50:03,419 --> 00:50:05,737
You sacrificed your powers
that you could walk?

558
00:50:06,858 --> 00:50:09,179
I sacrificed my power so that I could St..

559
00:50:12,687 --> 00:50:13,622
What do you know about it?

560
00:50:13,774 --> 00:50:15,739
I lost my fair share hah.

561
00:50:16,629 --> 00:50:17,993
Dry your eyes Erik.

562
00:50:18,621 --> 00:50:20,138
It doesn't justify what you've done.

563
00:50:20,302 --> 00:50:21,990
You've no idea what I have done.

564
00:50:22,111 --> 00:50:24,131
I know that you took the
things that mean most to me.

565
00:50:24,286 --> 00:50:26,329
Well maybe you should have
fought harder for them.

566
00:50:26,736 --> 00:50:29,744
Do you want to fight Erik?
I'll give you a fight !!

567
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:32,111
-Let him come.
-You abandoned me!

568
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,877
You took her away and you abandoned me!

569
00:50:35,057 --> 00:50:35,760
Angel.

570
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:37,377
Azazel.

571
00:50:38,503 --> 00:50:39,375
Emma.

572
00:50:40,336 --> 00:50:41,114
Banshee.

573
00:50:43,032 --> 00:50:46,229
Mutant brothers and sisters all dead!

574
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:50,279
Congress on this

575
00:50:50,409 --> 00:50:53,061
..experimented on
butchered Erik.

576
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:54,356
Where were you Charles?

577
00:50:55,326 --> 00:50:57,056
We were supposed to protect them!

578
00:50:58,113 --> 00:51:00,153
Where were you your own people needed you?

579
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:01,333
Hiding!

580
00:51:01,788 --> 00:51:04,851
You and Hank pretending you
were something you're not

581
00:51:05,427 --> 00:51:06,123
Erik.

582
00:51:08,355 --> 00:51:10,922
You abandon us all.

583
00:51:31,218 --> 00:51:32,594
So you were always an asshole

584
00:51:35,706 --> 00:51:38,346
I take it we're best buddies in the future

585
00:51:40,264 --> 00:51:43,132
I spent a lot of years trying
to bring you down bub

586
00:51:43,779 --> 00:51:45,309
how is that work out for you?

587
00:51:45,642 --> 00:51:47,028
You're like me.

588
00:51:48,876 --> 00:51:49,658
You're a survivor.

589
00:51:54,715 --> 00:51:56,512
You wanna pick all that shit up?

590
00:51:58,232 --> 00:52:00,065
Paris

591
00:52:18,294 --> 00:52:19,449
excuse me.

592
00:52:19,903 --> 00:52:23,646
I'm pretty sure it was my fault.

593
00:54:54,317 --> 00:54:56,955
Wanna play a game? It's been a while.

594
00:54:57,054 --> 00:54:58,608
I'm not in emotion for a game.

595
00:55:05,575 --> 00:55:07,903
Haven't had a real sip in 10 years.

596
00:55:20,769 --> 00:55:22,630
I didn't kill the president.

597
00:55:23,226 --> 00:55:25,433
Bullet curved Erik.

598
00:55:26,046 --> 00:55:27,607
Because I was trying to save him.

599
00:55:29,037 --> 00:55:30,632
They took me out before I could.

600
00:55:30,675 --> 00:55:33,180
-Why would you trying to save him?
-Because he was one of us.

601
00:55:45,365 --> 00:55:47,847
You must think me so foolish.

602
00:55:49,732 --> 00:55:51,685
We always said they would come after us.

603
00:55:51,768 --> 00:55:54,630
I never imagined they would
use raven's DNA to do it.

604
00:55:55,974 --> 00:55:57,776
When did you last see her?

605
00:56:00,965 --> 00:56:02,395
The day I left to Dallas.

606
00:56:03,841 --> 00:56:04,865
And how is she?

607
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:08,057
Strong.

608
00:56:08,819 --> 00:56:10,015
Driven

609
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:12,681
-loyal.
-How..

610
00:56:13,577 --> 00:56:14,635
How was she?

611
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,113
She was..

612
00:56:24,688 --> 00:56:27,333
I could see why she had so much talent.

613
00:56:30,339 --> 00:56:31,654
You should be proud of her Charles.

614
00:56:33,387 --> 00:56:35,134
She is out there fighting for our cause.

615
00:56:35,167 --> 00:56:36,317
Your cause.

616
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:40,050
The girl I knew she was
not capable of killing.

617
00:56:40,137 --> 00:56:42,050
You didn't raise her
you grew up with her.

618
00:56:42,172 --> 00:56:44,382
She couldn't stay a little girl forever
that's why she left

619
00:56:44,445 --> 00:56:47,819
she left because you got inside her head

620
00:56:49,321 --> 00:56:50,549
that's not my power.

621
00:56:52,716 --> 00:56:54,513
She made a choice.

622
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:57,203
But now we know where that choice leads
don't we?

623
00:56:57,621 --> 00:57:00,530
She's going to murder trask
they're going to capture her

624
00:57:00,657 --> 00:57:02,716
and then they're going to wipe us out.

625
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,236
Not if we get to her first.

626
00:57:06,401 --> 00:57:08,494
Not if we change history tomorrow.

627
00:57:14,116 --> 00:57:15,208
I'm sorry Charles.

628
00:57:20,211 --> 00:57:23,208
For what happened I truly am

629
00:57:26,616 --> 00:57:28,819
it's been a while since I played

630
00:57:31,688 --> 00:57:33,451
I'll go easy on you.

631
00:57:35,398 --> 00:57:36,626
Might finally get a fair fight.

632
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:39,381
You make the first move.

633
00:57:54,544 --> 00:57:57,513
The diplomats from all around the
world arriving here today at the

634
00:57:57,547 --> 00:57:59,285
<i> hotel royale.</i>

635
00:57:59,438 --> 00:58:02,540
<i> It's a historic day as
the official ending of </i>

636
00:58:02,563 --> 00:58:05,219
<i> the United States fierce
involvement in Vietnam.</i>

637
00:58:05,913 --> 00:58:07,909
There's the south
vietnamese foreign minister

638
00:58:07,922 --> 00:58:09,928
with other south
vietnamese dignitaries

639
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,817
the summit doesn't begin for another hour

640
00:58:13,163 --> 00:58:16,426
the hotel has arranged a private room
upstairs for you special quest

641
00:58:16,498 --> 00:58:17,582
that'll be fine.

642
00:58:22,974 --> 00:58:24,908
Good afternoon everyone
hello.

643
00:58:24,976 --> 00:58:26,130
Thank you for coming.

644
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:29,776
Congratulations on winning this war.

645
00:58:29,851 --> 00:58:34,148
Now I know you all have hands to
shake and photos to take downstairs

646
00:58:34,161 --> 00:58:35,901
so I will get right to the point.

647
00:58:37,396 --> 00:58:39,489
There is a new enemy out there.

648
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,684
An enemy that will render
your arsenals useless

649
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:46,035
your armies powerless and
your nations defenseless.

650
00:58:51,944 --> 00:58:53,810
<i> You'll need a new weapon for this war.</i>

651
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,978
<i> I call them "sentinels". </i>

652
00:58:57,883 --> 00:59:02,215
Named after the ancient guardians
that stood at the gates of the citadel.

653
00:59:03,922 --> 00:59:06,805
They have the aeronautic
capabilities of a harrier jet.

654
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:09,690
Armed with guns that can fire off

655
00:59:09,752 --> 00:59:13,747
<i> more than 2000 rounds per minute with
thermo-ceramic ammunition.</i>

656
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,970
But size power speed

657
00:59:17,115 --> 00:59:19,136
<i> you can find that at lockheed above. </i>

658
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:21,945
<i> No what makes the
sentinels so special?</i>

659
00:59:22,086 --> 00:59:25,091
<i> Is the ability to target
the mutant x gene? </i>

660
00:59:25,716 --> 00:59:30,108
The genetic guidance system that can
lock onto a mark half a mile away.

661
00:59:30,162 --> 00:59:33,533
And won't trigger unless it
has identified the target.

662
00:59:33,588 --> 00:59:36,349
With this weapon there'll be
no human collateral damage.

663
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:39,497
If I turn it on the system
couldn't even activate in here.

664
00:59:47,522 --> 00:59:48,230
<i> Unless... </i>

665
00:59:49,163 --> 00:59:51,122
...there's a mutant.

666
01:00:00,121 --> 01:00:02,461
There has to be some kind of mistake.

667
01:00:04,556 --> 01:00:06,931
My machine don't make mistakes.

668
01:00:09,595 --> 01:00:10,467
What are you?

669
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:12,967
I assure you

670
01:00:15,356 --> 01:00:15,856
I ..

671
01:00:15,966 --> 01:00:16,789
No.Don't shoot him.

672
01:00:17,342 --> 01:00:18,332
<i> I assure you. </i>

673
01:00:18,415 --> 01:00:19,060
Do not arrest him.

674
01:00:19,134 --> 01:00:20,134
I do not know what you're talking about.

675
01:00:54,777 --> 01:00:55,558
<i> Raven! </i>

676
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:02,258
Raven.

677
01:01:02,384 --> 01:01:03,360
Raven!

678
01:01:07,339 --> 01:01:07,914
Raven.

679
01:01:10,741 --> 01:01:11,475
Charles.

680
01:01:12,021 --> 01:01:13,965
We've come for you.
Erik and I.

681
01:01:14,493 --> 01:01:15,517
Together.

682
01:01:16,329 --> 01:01:18,422
<i>I never thought I could
see you again. </i>

683
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:22,063
<i>I made you a promise long time
ago that I would protect you.</i>

684
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:24,916
<i>I didn't. And I know...</i>

685
01:01:30,215 --> 01:01:31,175
<i> Wolverine! </i>

686
01:01:35,376 --> 01:01:37,851
I'm going to keep you safe
I'm going to keep you out of their hands

687
01:01:41,852 --> 01:01:42,756
Erik.

688
01:01:44,546 --> 01:01:45,475
Erik.

689
01:01:45,667 --> 01:01:47,111
What are you doing?

690
01:01:48,385 --> 01:01:50,029
Securing our future.

691
01:01:50,116 --> 01:01:51,549
Forgive me mystique.

692
01:01:52,515 --> 01:01:55,132
Ss long as you're out there
we'll never be safe.

693
01:01:56,664 --> 01:01:57,569
Erik.

694
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,612
Use your powers Charles.
Stop him.

695
01:01:59,818 --> 01:02:00,527
He can't.

696
01:02:31,367 --> 01:02:33,130
He is slipping.
He is slipping back.

697
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,480
<i>I'm loosing him.</i>

698
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:17,100
<i> Striker! </i>

699
01:03:17,451 --> 01:03:20,137
<i> This is where you started as Wolverine
okay? </i>

700
01:03:22,145 --> 01:03:22,652
<i> Kitty! </i>

701
01:03:26,391 --> 01:03:26,906
Restrain him.

702
01:03:42,513 --> 01:03:43,088
Erik!

703
01:03:53,614 --> 01:03:54,672
Where am I?

704
01:03:54,811 --> 01:03:55,272
Ahh.

705
01:03:57,739 --> 01:03:59,010
How the hell did I get here?

706
01:03:59,149 --> 01:04:00,647
What? You came to us.

707
01:04:01,715 --> 01:04:03,178
-Who are you?
-Charles.

708
01:04:03,272 --> 01:04:04,535
Charles Xavier.

709
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:06,268
-I do not know you.
-Ahh?

710
01:04:06,693 --> 01:04:07,837
What the hell is that?

711
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,460
Wow ho I can deal with this.

712
01:04:10,598 --> 01:04:12,313
Just go.
Stop Erik.

713
01:04:13,254 --> 01:04:13,921
Erik.

714
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:15,714
I'm sorry.

715
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:16,541
Erik.

716
01:04:35,976 --> 01:04:37,679
You are Logan.
That's Hank McCoy.

717
01:04:37,711 --> 01:04:38,606
I'm Charles Xavier.

718
01:04:38,705 --> 01:04:40,610
You spent the last couple of days with us.

719
01:04:44,101 --> 01:04:45,423
You're on acid?

720
01:04:46,538 --> 01:04:49,292
Somebody gave you really bad acid.

721
01:04:50,207 --> 01:04:50,933
Yeah?

722
01:05:35,638 --> 01:05:37,549
Just hold on tight we'll
get through this together.

723
01:05:39,484 --> 01:05:41,103
-Oh god !
- Kitty.

724
01:05:42,422 --> 01:05:44,287
She is wounded pretty bad.

725
01:06:48,926 --> 01:06:50,246
I got him.

726
01:06:54,908 --> 01:06:55,840
Professor.

727
01:06:56,670 --> 01:06:57,762
What happened to you?

728
01:06:59,034 --> 01:07:01,682
I just saw someone who's going to
bring me a lot of pain someday.

729
01:07:04,907 --> 01:07:05,965
Where is raven?

730
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:07,085
Gone.

731
01:07:07,561 --> 01:07:09,037
-What?
-We have to get out of here.

732
01:07:18,954 --> 01:07:21,251
Yesterday the Paris
peace summit was rocked

733
01:07:21,264 --> 01:07:23,571
by the appearance of
unidentified assailants.

734
01:07:23,747 --> 01:07:25,738
<i> The likes of which the
world has never seen.</i>

735
01:07:26,061 --> 01:07:28,603
<i> Mass hysteria has gripped the
nation as people ask </i>

736
01:07:28,857 --> 01:07:31,089
<i> where did they come from?
Will they'd be back? </i>

737
01:07:31,318 --> 01:07:32,545
<i> And most importantly </i>

738
01:07:32,667 --> 01:07:33,667
<i> are they friend or foe? </i>

739
01:07:34,607 --> 01:07:36,602
<i>That was one in corresponding
to the earlier</i>

740
01:07:36,615 --> 01:07:38,620
<i>reporting from the Paris
peace summit yesterday.</i>

741
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:41,747
What the hell are we dealing with here?

742
01:07:42,444 --> 01:07:43,605
Off the record.

743
01:07:44,013 --> 01:07:45,145
Two days ago

744
01:07:45,293 --> 01:07:47,773
this man Erick lehnsherr
escaped from a

745
01:07:47,786 --> 01:07:50,277
maximum security prison
inside the Pentagon.

746
01:07:50,324 --> 01:07:53,899
<i> We believe that this woman is a
former associate of lehnsherr's. </i>

747
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,462
They were together in Cuba
the day of the crisis in 1962.

748
01:07:58,181 --> 01:08:01,118
Hs was also linked to the
Kennedy assassination.

749
01:08:02,853 --> 01:08:03,945
What about that thing?

750
01:08:04,329 --> 01:08:05,774
We do not know what that thing is sir.

751
01:08:06,077 --> 01:08:08,136
Actually we really don't
know what any of them are.

752
01:08:08,353 --> 01:08:09,119
Yes.

753
01:08:10,195 --> 01:08:11,429
Yes
we do.

754
01:08:11,813 --> 01:08:12,837
They are mutants.

755
01:08:14,452 --> 01:08:18,092
He ​​has the power to control metal.

756
01:08:18,791 --> 01:08:21,494
Last I checked that's what most
of your weapons were made of.

757
01:08:21,918 --> 01:08:25,303
And she can transform into anyone.

758
01:08:25,747 --> 01:08:26,778
A general.

759
01:08:27,082 --> 01:08:28,114
A secret service man.

760
01:08:28,443 --> 01:08:30,017
Even you Mr. president.

761
01:08:30,721 --> 01:08:33,473
She can walk into this office
and order a nuclear strike

762
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:35,156
if she was in the mood.

763
01:08:35,804 --> 01:08:37,409
And that's only two of them.

764
01:08:37,663 --> 01:08:40,234
Well do we have any countermeasures
any defense?

765
01:08:40,373 --> 01:08:41,989
I was waiting for you to
ask me that question.

766
01:08:43,458 --> 01:08:47,138
That's an experimental program sir.
Strictly off the books.

767
01:08:55,810 --> 01:08:58,745
You're telling me these
mutants are out in the world

768
01:08:58,844 --> 01:09:01,435
and our best defense are
these giant metal robots?

769
01:09:01,536 --> 01:09:03,629
Many of the mutants looks like us.

770
01:09:03,981 --> 01:09:06,006
My sentinels can tell the difference.

771
01:09:06,498 --> 01:09:08,523
I have 8 prototypes ready to go

772
01:09:08,898 --> 01:09:12,638
they're built out of a space age polymer
not an ounce of metal on them.

773
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:20,500
I wanna make a demonstration

774
01:09:20,709 --> 01:09:23,072
I want the world
to know that we can protect them.

775
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:24,920
What do you need to get
these things operational?

776
01:09:25,013 --> 01:09:26,561
I already gave that number to congress

777
01:09:26,909 --> 01:09:29,360
unfortunately they elected to shut me down.

778
01:09:29,674 --> 01:09:32,331
It's going to cost a bit
more to turn them on.

779
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:33,186
Whatever you need.

780
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:36,716
Oh and one more thing
if we do manage to capture them

781
01:09:37,148 --> 01:09:41,037
I would like her for
research purposes of course.

782
01:09:47,091 --> 01:09:47,979
Horrible.

783
01:09:49,681 --> 01:09:50,903
What is it?

784
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:52,593
He was born like that.

785
01:09:53,127 --> 01:09:53,785
True?

786
01:09:54,552 --> 01:09:56,679
Just imagine ..

787
01:09:57,044 --> 01:09:58,988
Reflecting and see the ugly face like that?

788
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:01,490
I can imagine.

789
01:10:05,717 --> 01:10:07,475
Where did he come from?

790
01:10:08,684 --> 01:10:09,844
Did he have a family?

791
01:10:13,151 --> 01:10:15,878
Yes she does.

792
01:11:04,065 --> 01:11:08,058
If I see so much as a screw
I'll jam this into your throat.

793
01:11:09,173 --> 01:11:10,525
How did you find me?

794
01:11:10,972 --> 01:11:11,996
You taught me well.

795
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,739
It's been a long time
since we were this close.

796
01:11:16,214 --> 01:11:17,454
I miss you.

797
01:11:18,082 --> 01:11:19,140
You tried to kill me.

798
01:11:19,694 --> 01:11:21,289
So the rest of us could live.

799
01:11:23,354 --> 01:11:24,609
What do you mean?

800
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:27,241
I received a message from the future.

801
01:11:27,377 --> 01:11:29,072
Don't lie to me.

802
01:11:29,673 --> 01:11:31,698
I never have
I never will.

803
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:35,768
Humans use your
blood your genes to

804
01:11:35,793 --> 01:11:38,065
create a weapon that
wipes us all out.

805
01:11:38,826 --> 01:11:41,822
I was only doing what I thought
necessary to secure our future.

806
01:11:41,963 --> 01:11:45,135
So what's to stop me from killing you
right now and securing my future?

807
01:11:46,603 --> 01:11:47,301
Nothing.

808
01:11:49,046 --> 01:11:50,262
It doesn't matter anymore.

809
01:11:50,824 --> 01:11:53,706
They have your DNA
your blood was on the street.

810
01:11:54,646 --> 01:11:55,806
Whose fault is that?

811
01:11:57,517 --> 01:11:58,226
Mine.

812
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:01,376
I've seen their plans.

813
01:12:01,882 --> 01:12:03,309
They are creating a weapon

814
01:12:03,399 --> 01:12:06,787
and now they have what they
need to take it further.

815
01:12:08,613 --> 01:12:11,999
We have to strike now while we have a
chance while we still hold the upper hand.

816
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,616
I've seen too many friends die Eric.

817
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,524
I don't want a war.

818
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:23,290
I only want the man who murdered them.

819
01:12:23,333 --> 01:12:24,393
This is a war.

820
01:12:26,614 --> 01:12:27,672
What happened to you?

821
01:12:28,915 --> 01:12:31,713
Did you lose your way
when I was gone?

822
01:12:33,488 --> 01:12:35,560
Are you still charles’s' raven?

823
01:12:37,861 --> 01:12:39,829
Or are you mystique?

824
01:12:43,774 --> 01:12:45,833
Trask is the enemy.

825
01:12:47,138 --> 01:12:49,197
Killing one man isn't enough.

826
01:12:49,892 --> 01:12:50,984
It never was for you.

827
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:53,326
Good bye Erik.

828
01:13:19,203 --> 01:13:20,135
What happened?

829
01:13:20,977 --> 01:13:21,944
Can he walk?

830
01:13:22,139 --> 01:13:23,106
He need his treatment.

831
01:13:23,597 --> 01:13:25,115
Hank I can hear them.

832
01:13:25,472 --> 01:13:27,659
It's ok
I'll make it stop. I'll get it

833
01:13:30,248 --> 01:13:32,083
hey
hey. Pull yourself together

834
01:13:32,669 --> 01:13:33,872
it's not over yet.

835
01:13:37,778 --> 01:13:39,678
You don’t believe that?

836
01:13:41,192 --> 01:13:42,159
How do you know?

837
01:13:42,333 --> 01:13:43,391
As these go

838
01:13:46,163 --> 01:13:48,638
this coming back.

839
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:51,903
They all come back.

840
01:13:57,482 --> 01:13:58,333
Look you know.

841
01:13:59,797 --> 01:14:00,860
I'm still here.

842
01:14:02,213 --> 01:14:03,695
She's still out there.

843
01:14:06,083 --> 01:14:07,472
But we need your help Charles.

844
01:14:08,717 --> 01:14:10,520
Not like this I need you.

845
01:14:10,845 --> 01:14:12,126
We can't find raven..

846
01:14:12,391 --> 01:14:13,391
..Not without your powers.

847
01:14:17,638 --> 01:14:20,261
I added a little extra
cause you missed a dose.

848
01:14:25,666 --> 01:14:26,655
Charles.

849
01:14:58,135 --> 01:14:59,685
Hank do me a favour.

850
01:15:01,105 --> 01:15:02,820
Would you help me to my study please.

851
01:15:08,165 --> 01:15:09,673
Gonna get you.

852
01:15:20,435 --> 01:15:21,919
Are you sure about this?

853
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:25,214
Absolutely not.

854
01:15:32,521 --> 01:15:34,558
This creature is extraordinary.

855
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,791
Her genes could hold the
key to mutation itself.

856
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:40,825
I need more.

857
01:15:41,043 --> 01:15:44,012
That's all they were able to scrape off
the pavement in Paris.

858
01:15:44,082 --> 01:15:45,175
More than blood.

859
01:15:45,996 --> 01:15:47,054
I need brain tissue.

860
01:15:47,741 --> 01:15:48,867
Spinal fluid.

861
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:50,852
Bone marrow.

862
01:15:51,655 --> 01:15:55,751
Imagine sentinels that could transform
adapt to any target.

863
01:15:56,443 --> 01:15:57,931
If I just get my hands on her.

864
01:15:58,229 --> 01:16:03,962
This girl could lead the program
forward years decades into the future.

865
01:16:05,673 --> 01:16:06,833
How old is your son now major?

866
01:16:08,205 --> 01:16:08,878
Jason?

867
01:16:09,568 --> 01:16:11,466
He's coming up on 10 now
if you can believe it.

868
01:16:11,602 --> 01:16:13,036
Eight years from fighting age.

869
01:16:13,435 --> 01:16:16,806
And how many of our sons and brothers did
we just ship home in body bags?

870
01:16:17,181 --> 01:16:19,043
Maybe 50? 55000?

871
01:16:19,216 --> 01:16:20,933
How many more in the other side?

872
01:16:22,295 --> 01:16:23,233
Never before

873
01:16:24,287 --> 01:16:26,272
in all of human history

874
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:31,492
has there been a cause which
could unite us as a species?

875
01:16:32,997 --> 01:16:34,435
Until now.

876
01:16:36,782 --> 01:16:38,841
You really hate mutants doctor don't you?

877
01:16:38,963 --> 01:16:43,900
On the contrary I rather admire
them the things they can do.

878
01:16:45,176 --> 01:16:47,835
I assume mutants as our salvation.

879
01:16:48,438 --> 01:16:49,462
And common enemy.

880
01:16:50,181 --> 01:16:53,321
Common struggle against the ultimate enemy.

881
01:16:54,179 --> 01:16:55,579
Extinction.

882
01:16:56,502 --> 01:16:59,911
I believe our new friends are going
to help us Usher in a new era bill.

883
01:17:00,191 --> 01:17:05,026
A new era of genuine and
long lasting peace.

884
01:17:19,176 --> 01:17:20,920
<i> Attention! Attention! </i>

885
01:17:20,941 --> 01:17:23,146
<i> Transport departure in two hours. </i>

886
01:17:23,147 --> 01:17:23,663
<i> Repeat. </i>

887
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:26,772
<i> Transport departure begins in two hours. </i>

888
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:35,373
When was the last time you down here?

889
01:17:36,126 --> 01:17:38,922
-Last time we went looking for students.
- A life time ago.

890
01:17:45,936 --> 01:17:47,062
<i>Welcome professor.</i>

891
01:18:11,528 --> 01:18:13,689
Raven is wounded
she won't be moving fast.

892
01:18:22,157 --> 01:18:24,387
These are muscles I haven't
stretched in a long time.

893
01:18:44,977 --> 01:18:45,914
Gosh!

894
01:18:52,754 --> 01:18:54,410
<i>-No!
-Who are you?</i>

895
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:12,327
Charles!

896
01:19:20,530 --> 01:19:21,957
Charles it's alright.

897
01:19:25,669 --> 01:19:27,534
I'll go check the generator.

898
01:19:35,579 --> 01:19:37,444
It's not the machinery
is it?

899
01:19:37,647 --> 01:19:40,826
-I can't do this my mind...
-Yes you can.

900
01:19:40,935 --> 01:19:42,849
-It won't take it.
-It's just a little rusty.

901
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,080
You do not understand
it’s not a question of being rusty.

902
01:19:45,154 --> 01:19:47,077
I can flip the switches
I can turn the knobs.

903
01:19:47,219 --> 01:19:49,614
But my power comes from here
comes from ..

904
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:52,436
And it's broken.

905
01:19:54,194 --> 01:19:55,286
I feel like one of my students.

906
01:19:56,339 --> 01:19:57,328
Helpless.

907
01:19:59,146 --> 01:20:02,091
It was a mistake coming down here.
It was a mistake freeing Eric.

908
01:20:02,169 --> 01:20:04,283
This whole thing has
been one bloody mistake.

909
01:20:04,437 --> 01:20:06,910
I'm sorry Logan
they sent back the wrong man.

910
01:20:07,611 --> 01:20:08,635
You're right.

911
01:20:10,614 --> 01:20:11,603
I’m.

912
01:20:13,028 --> 01:20:14,500
Actually it was supposed to be you.

913
01:20:15,652 --> 01:20:18,023
But I was the only one who could
physically make the trip.

914
01:20:20,019 --> 01:20:22,691
And ahh don't know how long we've got here.

915
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:25,842
But I do know that a long time actually

916
01:20:26,587 --> 01:20:28,545
a long time from now.

917
01:20:29,566 --> 01:20:32,102
I was your lost helpless student.

918
01:20:33,092 --> 01:20:35,430
And you unlocked my mind.

919
01:20:35,639 --> 01:20:39,743
You showed me what I was
you showed me what I could be.

920
01:20:40,544 --> 01:20:42,352
I don't know how to do that for you

921
01:20:42,613 --> 01:20:43,864
you're right
I don't.

922
01:20:46,583 --> 01:20:47,815
But I know someone who might.

923
01:20:50,654 --> 01:20:52,877
Look into my mind.

924
01:20:53,690 --> 01:20:55,301
You saw what I did to cerebro.

925
01:20:56,102 --> 01:20:57,447
You don't want me inside your head.

926
01:20:57,463 --> 01:21:00,116
There's no damage you can do.
That has already been done trust me.

927
01:21:12,642 --> 01:21:13,208
Hey.

928
01:21:15,951 --> 01:21:17,526
-Hey Logan.
-Hey Jean.

929
01:21:18,404 --> 01:21:19,961
-Kill me.
-I love you.

930
01:21:23,072 --> 01:21:24,882
You're a..

931
01:21:26,816 --> 01:21:28,232
..Poor man.

932
01:21:28,343 --> 01:21:28,850
Look past me.

933
01:21:28,916 --> 01:21:33,783
I don't want suffering!
I don't want your future!

934
01:21:33,867 --> 01:21:35,403
Pass my future.

935
01:21:35,949 --> 01:21:37,439
Look for your future.

936
01:21:41,638 --> 01:21:42,513
That's it.

937
01:21:43,573 --> 01:21:44,479
That's it.

938
01:21:46,087 --> 01:21:46,791
That's it.

939
01:22:35,740 --> 01:22:37,206
Charles.

940
01:22:39,708 --> 01:22:40,902
Charles.

941
01:22:45,234 --> 01:22:46,967
So this is what become of us?

942
01:22:48,867 --> 01:22:50,014
Erik was right.

943
01:22:51,393 --> 01:22:53,316
Humanity does this to us.

944
01:22:53,517 --> 01:22:55,917
Not if we show them a better path.

945
01:22:57,548 --> 01:22:58,817
You still believe?

946
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:01,577
Just because someone stumbles
loses their way

947
01:23:02,043 --> 01:23:04,142
it doesn't mean they're lost forever.

948
01:23:05,221 --> 01:23:08,715
Sometimes we all need a little help.

949
01:23:10,126 --> 01:23:11,708
I'm not the man I was.

950
01:23:14,096 --> 01:23:15,237
I opened my mind

951
01:23:16,611 --> 01:23:18,987
it almost overwhelms me.

952
01:23:19,236 --> 01:23:20,166
You're afraid.

953
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:23,169
And cerebro knows it.

954
01:23:23,771 --> 01:23:25,477
All those voices..

955
01:23:28,177 --> 01:23:32,671
So..... much...... pain.

956
01:23:33,149 --> 01:23:35,208
It's not their pain you're afraid of.

957
01:23:36,628 --> 01:23:38,653
It's yours Charles.

958
01:23:39,865 --> 01:23:42,024
And as frightening as it may be

959
01:23:42,603 --> 01:23:44,612
that pain will make you stronger.

960
01:23:45,743 --> 01:23:48,132
If you allow yourself to feel it

961
01:23:48,963 --> 01:23:50,613
embrace it.

962
01:23:51,968 --> 01:23:55,419
It will make you more powerful
than you ever imagined.

963
01:23:56,139 --> 01:23:59,427
It's the greatest gift we have

964
01:23:59,795 --> 01:24:02,935
to bear their pain without breaking.

965
01:24:03,667 --> 01:24:07,371
And it's born from the most human power

966
01:24:09,051 --> 01:24:09,850
hope.

967
01:24:19,996 --> 01:24:20,949
Please

968
01:24:21,551 --> 01:24:25,449
Charles we need to hope again.

969
01:24:34,482 --> 01:24:36,426
Find what you were looking for?

970
01:24:42,672 --> 01:24:43,739
Power is back on.

971
01:24:44,168 --> 01:24:44,783
Yes.

972
01:24:46,533 --> 01:24:47,588
Yes it is.

973
01:26:28,190 --> 01:26:30,090
She's lost too much blood.

974
01:26:30,538 --> 01:26:33,533
-She can't keep going like this
-we have no choice Bobby.

975
01:26:34,382 --> 01:26:35,311
We can wake him up.

976
01:26:35,376 --> 01:26:36,066
No.

977
01:26:37,344 --> 01:26:38,532
They need more time.

978
01:26:39,206 --> 01:26:43,868
I had a glimpse into the past

979
01:26:43,983 --> 01:26:48,819
if we wake Logan now we may set off an
even darker course.

980
01:26:48,992 --> 01:26:50,453
They need more time.

981
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:12,068
Raven stop.

982
01:27:12,889 --> 01:27:13,785
Stop running.

983
01:27:14,775 --> 01:27:15,532
Charles.

984
01:27:17,910 --> 01:27:18,897
Where are you?

985
01:27:19,175 --> 01:27:20,207
Back at the house.

986
01:27:20,396 --> 01:27:21,943
..Where you should be.

987
01:27:22,275 --> 01:27:24,416
I need you to come home.

988
01:27:25,046 --> 01:27:26,765
I know what I need to do.

989
01:27:30,993 --> 01:27:31,833
If you kill trask

990
01:27:31,891 --> 01:27:34,047
you will be creating
countless more just like him.

991
01:27:34,555 --> 01:27:35,758
Then I'll kill them too.

992
01:27:35,943 --> 01:27:38,127
Those are Erick's works not yours.

993
01:27:42,064 --> 01:27:44,546
The girl I grew up with
wasn't capable of killing

994
01:27:44,740 --> 01:27:48,161
she was good fair
full of compassion.

995
01:27:49,495 --> 01:27:52,402
I have compassion
just not for trask.

996
01:27:52,602 --> 01:27:54,398
<i>He's murdered too many of us. </i>

997
01:27:58,777 --> 01:28:00,305
Shut her down Charles
get in her head.

998
01:28:00,769 --> 01:28:02,841
She's not letting me in
I'm barely holding on.

999
01:28:02,854 --> 01:28:04,937
I'm not strong enough yet.

1000
01:28:13,452 --> 01:28:15,094
I know what trask has done.

1001
01:28:16,036 --> 01:28:18,061
But
killing him will not bring them back.

1002
01:28:18,925 --> 01:28:21,864
It will set you on a path from which
there is no return

1003
01:28:22,729 --> 01:28:26,450
an endless cycle of
killing us and them

1004
01:28:26,621 --> 01:28:28,160
till there is nothing left.

1005
01:28:29,368 --> 01:28:31,624
But we can stop it right now.

1006
01:28:31,824 --> 01:28:32,824
You and I.

1007
01:28:34,306 --> 01:28:36,584
<i> You just have to come home. </i>

1008
01:28:38,444 --> 01:28:39,477
I have to .

1009
01:28:40,768 --> 01:28:42,505
You haven't changed at all
Charles.

1010
01:28:43,382 --> 01:28:44,598
<i> Like I said. </i>

1011
01:28:44,798 --> 01:28:46,808
I know exactly what I have to do.

1012
01:29:02,434 --> 01:29:03,170
Where is he?

1013
01:29:03,862 --> 01:29:06,044
At an airport boarding a plane.

1014
01:29:06,283 --> 01:29:07,951
Plane to where?

1015
01:29:10,509 --> 01:29:12,180
Washington DC.

1016
01:29:14,078 --> 01:29:15,192
Hey guys

1017
01:29:15,961 --> 01:29:18,211
there is something I need to show to you.

1018
01:29:19,939 --> 01:29:21,747
<i>We're going backwards in time.</i>

1019
01:29:22,018 --> 01:29:25,185
This the system I designed to
record any news about Paris

1020
01:29:25,488 --> 01:29:27,749
over all 3 networks and pbs.

1021
01:29:28,262 --> 01:29:29,972
All three? Wow

1022
01:29:30,293 --> 01:29:31,926
yeah and pbs.

1023
01:29:33,071 --> 01:29:34,163
Look what I found.

1024
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:37,728
Tomorrow in front of the white house the
president will make his announcement .

1025
01:29:37,965 --> 01:29:40,326
He'll be joined by secretary
of defense Blair.

1026
01:29:40,409 --> 01:29:43,850
And has even sought the help of
renowned scientist bolivar trask.

1027
01:29:44,041 --> 01:29:46,683
<i>His special adviser to combat
this mutant issue. </i>

1028
01:29:47,069 --> 01:29:48,392
<i> White house is.... </i>

1029
01:29:48,755 --> 01:29:51,036
Raven doesn't realize but
if she kills trask at

1030
01:29:51,049 --> 01:29:53,340
an event like that with
the whole world watching

1031
01:29:55,387 --> 01:29:57,268
then I came a long way for nothing.

1032
01:29:58,390 --> 01:30:00,555
And there's more bad news
I saw in a report.

1033
01:30:00,823 --> 01:30:02,777
They found traces of her blood in Paris.

1034
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:05,489
<i>For all we know they
already have her DNA </i>.

1035
01:30:05,979 --> 01:30:06,869
<i> That's all they need </i>

1036
01:30:07,069 --> 01:30:08,896
to create the sentinels in the future.

1037
01:30:12,681 --> 01:30:15,887
Now there's a theory in time
physics that time is immutable.

1038
01:30:16,739 --> 01:30:19,013
It's like a river you can
throw a pebble and it will

1039
01:30:19,026 --> 01:30:21,311
create a ripple but the current
always corrects itself.

1040
01:30:22,514 --> 01:30:26,236
No matter what you do the river just
keeps flowing in the same direction.

1041
01:30:26,893 --> 01:30:28,067
What are you trying to say?

1042
01:30:28,420 --> 01:30:29,548
I was saying is..

1043
01:30:30,568 --> 01:30:31,756
What if the war is inevitable.

1044
01:30:32,182 --> 01:30:33,981
What if she's meant to kill trask.

1045
01:30:35,527 --> 01:30:37,975
What if this is just simply who she is.

1046
01:30:40,399 --> 01:30:43,699
Just because someone stumbles
loses their way.

1047
01:30:44,503 --> 01:30:46,285
Doesn't mean they're lost forever.

1048
01:30:51,443 --> 01:30:53,412
I don't believe that theory Hank.

1049
01:30:55,347 --> 01:30:57,474
And I can not believe that who she is.

1050
01:30:59,886 --> 01:31:02,385
Ready the plane
we're going to Washington.

1051
01:31:04,638 --> 01:31:06,701
Washington. D.C.

1052
01:32:21,266 --> 01:32:22,196
You alright ?

1053
01:32:22,434 --> 01:32:23,492
Getting there.

1054
01:32:28,799 --> 01:32:31,307
Whatever happens today
I need you to promise me something.

1055
01:32:32,310 --> 01:32:35,336
You looked into my mind and you've seen
a lot of bad but

1056
01:32:36,248 --> 01:32:37,593
you've seen the good too.

1057
01:32:38,975 --> 01:32:39,771
The X-Men.

1058
01:32:41,847 --> 01:32:43,209
Promise me you'll find us.

1059
01:32:45,357 --> 01:32:47,335
Use your power
bring us together.

1060
01:32:47,965 --> 01:32:49,634
Guide us. Lead us.

1061
01:32:51,727 --> 01:32:52,407
Storm

1062
01:32:53,196 --> 01:32:54,040
Scott

1063
01:32:56,368 --> 01:32:57,518
Jean.

1064
01:32:59,337 --> 01:33:00,674
Remember those names.

1065
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:03,609
There's so many of us.

1066
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:07,471
We will need you professor.

1067
01:33:10,415 --> 01:33:12,820
I will do my best.

1068
01:33:13,285 --> 01:33:14,343
Your best is enough.

1069
01:33:16,829 --> 01:33:17,708
Trust me.

1070
01:33:42,701 --> 01:33:44,966
12 carriers inbound 10 miles.

1071
01:33:46,430 --> 01:33:47,838
They found us.

1072
01:34:04,281 --> 01:34:06,671
<i> Thousands of people will
be gathered here they</i>

1073
01:34:06,684 --> 01:34:09,085
<i>come from all over the
world witness history </i>

1074
01:34:09,147 --> 01:34:12,682
along with news crews from
at least 50 different countries.

1075
01:34:14,258 --> 01:34:14,968
Thank you.

1076
01:34:18,056 --> 01:34:19,598
Can I see your invitations please?

1077
01:34:20,297 --> 01:34:21,508
Yes you may..

1078
01:34:21,617 --> 01:34:22,828
These two are with me.

1079
01:34:23,054 --> 01:34:24,043
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

1080
01:34:31,746 --> 01:34:32,470
<i> Logan. </i>

1081
01:34:33,126 --> 01:34:34,474
Please this way sir.

1082
01:34:59,386 --> 01:35:00,286
It's fine...

1083
01:35:01,518 --> 01:35:03,484
I haven't found her yet
but she has to be here.

1084
01:35:03,638 --> 01:35:05,481
<i> President of the United States. </i>

1085
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:29,397
My fellow Americans

1086
01:35:30,089 --> 01:35:34,549
<i> today we face the greatest
threat in our history. </i>

1087
01:35:34,885 --> 01:35:35,636
Mutants.

1088
01:35:36,221 --> 01:35:37,220
<i>I'm pregnant..</i>

1089
01:35:39,096 --> 01:35:41,174
We have prepared for this threat.

1090
01:35:44,495 --> 01:35:47,370
In the immortal words
of Robert Oppenheimer.

1091
01:35:48,245 --> 01:35:49,338
Behold..

1092
01:35:49,965 --> 01:35:52,916
The world will never be the same again.

1093
01:36:23,434 --> 01:36:24,366
Can I help you?

1094
01:36:27,504 --> 01:36:28,584
No you can't.

1095
01:37:06,477 --> 01:37:07,448
Here they come.

1096
01:37:14,667 --> 01:37:16,315
<i>This for you brothers and sisters. </i>

1097
01:37:19,347 --> 01:37:19,886
Raven.

1098
01:37:22,915 --> 01:37:24,041
I have her.

1099
01:37:24,528 --> 01:37:26,027
Let me go Charles.

1100
01:37:27,952 --> 01:37:29,302
There. You see?

1101
01:37:29,729 --> 01:37:31,752
Secret service man
left to the stage.

1102
01:37:31,824 --> 01:37:32,785
-Got it.
-Go.

1103
01:37:53,657 --> 01:37:55,307
What the hell are you doing?

1104
01:37:55,389 --> 01:37:56,950
I didn't tell you to activate it.

1105
01:37:57,090 --> 01:37:57,854
I didn't.

1106
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,344
Raven please listen to me.

1107
01:38:19,173 --> 01:38:22,382
<i>We've been given a second
chance to define who we are.</i>

1108
01:38:25,110 --> 01:38:26,624
Don't do this.

1109
01:38:29,999 --> 01:38:32,160
Gentlemen you cannot pass this point.

1110
01:38:40,444 --> 01:38:41,661
We can't stop that many.

1111
01:38:42,216 --> 01:38:42,694
No.

1112
01:38:43,104 --> 01:38:44,803
But we can slow them down.

1113
01:39:22,944 --> 01:39:24,716
Erik!

1114
01:40:00,253 --> 01:40:01,614
Move it ! Comon let's go!!

1115
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:10,788
Storm!

1116
01:40:47,671 --> 01:40:51,280
<i> Take us to def-con 3.
Mr. president we are code red. </i>

1117
01:40:51,351 --> 01:40:52,500
<i> Air defense ready now. </i>

1118
01:40:54,057 --> 01:40:55,458
<i> What the hell happened out there? </i>

1119
01:40:55,484 --> 01:40:56,370
I'll fix it.

1120
01:40:56,790 --> 01:40:57,757
You said that before

1121
01:40:57,790 --> 01:40:58,977
I wanted to make a statement.

1122
01:40:59,041 --> 01:41:01,622
<i> Now the whole goddamn world knows
we can't protect them.</i>

1123
01:41:02,127 --> 01:41:03,319
<i>I will fix it. </i>

1124
01:41:03,338 --> 01:41:04,338
<i>You damn well better.</i>

1125
01:42:16,275 --> 01:42:17,242
Charles!

1126
01:43:06,047 --> 01:43:07,434
Is everybody okay?

1127
01:43:41,593 --> 01:43:42,610
Storm!

1128
01:43:46,489 --> 01:43:47,545
Behind you.

1129
01:44:31,957 --> 01:44:32,740
Now.

1130
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,619
I'm probably not supposed to
ask this kind of a thing.

1131
01:44:58,852 --> 01:45:02,181
But in the future
do I make it?

1132
01:45:02,840 --> 01:45:03,534
No.

1133
01:45:05,933 --> 01:45:07,705
But we can change that right?

1134
01:45:19,566 --> 01:45:21,340
Do what you were made for.

1135
01:45:22,381 --> 01:45:23,617
Mutants.

1136
01:45:30,795 --> 01:45:31,734
Where are you?

1137
01:45:48,977 --> 01:45:51,409
I got this. Go.

1138
01:46:33,392 --> 01:46:34,603
Oh dear god
no.

1139
01:46:50,394 --> 01:46:52,531
So much for being a survivor.

1140
01:47:35,559 --> 01:47:36,811
One of them is in here.

1141
01:47:39,412 --> 01:47:40,324
<i>No! No! No! </i>

1142
01:47:40,414 --> 01:47:41,186
<i> Don't kill it. </i>

1143
01:47:41,465 --> 01:47:42,521
I need it alive.

1144
01:47:56,108 --> 01:47:57,579
What the hell has happened?

1145
01:49:05,863 --> 01:49:08,067
You built these weapons to destroy us.

1146
01:49:09,002 --> 01:49:09,935
Why?

1147
01:49:14,486 --> 01:49:17,174
Because you're afraid of our gifts.

1148
01:49:17,957 --> 01:49:19,743
Because we are different.

1149
01:49:21,647 --> 01:49:25,597
Humanity has always feared that
which is different.

1150
01:49:25,583 --> 01:49:28,049
But I'm here to tell you
tell the world.

1151
01:49:29,459 --> 01:49:31,318
You're right to fear us.

1152
01:49:32,110 --> 01:49:33,197
<i>We are the future.</i>

1153
01:49:34,304 --> 01:49:36,851
We are the ones who will
inherit this earth.

1154
01:49:37,512 --> 01:49:39,592
And anyone who stands in our way

1155
01:49:39,637 --> 01:49:43,642
will suffer the same fate as
these men you see before you.

1156
01:49:50,632 --> 01:49:54,021
Today was meant to be a
display of your power.

1157
01:49:54,331 --> 01:49:59,921
Instead I give you a glimpse of the
devastation my race can unleash upon yours.

1158
01:50:08,994 --> 01:50:11,887
<i>Let this be a warning to the world. </i>

1159
01:50:12,159 --> 01:50:15,239
<i> And to my mutant brothers
and sisters out there </i>

1160
01:50:15,736 --> 01:50:17,332
<i> I say this: </i>

1161
01:50:17,578 --> 01:50:19,102
<i> No more hiding. </i>

1162
01:50:19,562 --> 01:50:21,286
<i> No more suffering. </i>

1163
01:50:22,471 --> 01:50:27,931
You've lived in a shadows in shame
and fear too long. Come out.

1164
01:50:28,852 --> 01:50:33,846
<i> Join me fight together in the
brotherhood of our kind. </i>

1165
01:50:34,337 --> 01:50:36,097
New tomorrow.

1166
01:50:37,659 --> 01:50:39,545
..That starts today.

1167
01:50:46,510 --> 01:50:50,249
All those years wasted fighting each other
Charles

1168
01:50:53,888 --> 01:50:57,449
to have a precious few of them back.

1169
01:51:36,424 --> 01:51:36,987
Mr. president.

1170
01:51:37,035 --> 01:51:38,775
Stand down ! I said stand down!

1171
01:51:41,418 --> 01:51:43,036
You want to make a statement?

1172
01:51:43,521 --> 01:51:45,291
<i> Kill me...Finally </i>

1173
01:51:45,715 --> 01:51:47,526
<i> but spare everyone else! </i>

1174
01:52:00,126 --> 01:52:01,955
Very heroic Mr. president.

1175
01:52:02,948 --> 01:52:05,615
But you had no intention
of sparing any of us.

1176
01:52:06,872 --> 01:52:10,303
The future of our species begins now.

1177
01:52:14,681 --> 01:52:15,226
<i>Mutant</i>

1178
01:52:19,564 --> 01:52:20,512
<i>mutants</i>

1179
01:52:45,645 --> 01:52:46,879
you used to be a better shot.

1180
01:52:46,937 --> 01:52:48,278
Trust me
I still I'm.

1181
01:53:01,779 --> 01:53:03,390
Get out of my head Charles!

1182
01:53:03,645 --> 01:53:04,333
Raven

1183
01:53:05,262 --> 01:53:07,247
please do not make us the enemy today.

1184
01:53:07,561 --> 01:53:09,231
Look around you
we already are.

1185
01:53:09,593 --> 01:53:11,373
They not all of us.

1186
01:53:11,862 --> 01:53:13,517
All you've done so far

1187
01:53:13,656 --> 01:53:16,169
is save the lives of these men.

1188
01:53:17,148 --> 01:53:19,458
You can show them a better path.

1189
01:53:23,500 --> 01:53:25,240
Shut her down Charles

1190
01:53:27,266 --> 01:53:30,467
I've been trying to control you
ever since the day we met.

1191
01:53:31,197 --> 01:53:32,924
And look what that's got us

1192
01:53:35,066 --> 01:53:37,897
everything that happens now

1193
01:53:38,717 --> 01:53:40,044
is in your hand.

1194
01:53:45,314 --> 01:53:47,847
I have a faith in you raven.

1195
01:55:26,874 --> 01:55:28,438
He's all yours Charles.

1196
01:55:56,743 --> 01:55:58,935
If you let them have me
I'm as good as dead.

1197
01:55:59,366 --> 01:56:00,377
You know that.

1198
01:56:01,443 --> 01:56:02,172
I know.

1199
01:56:05,122 --> 01:56:06,154
Good-bye old friend.

1200
01:56:09,169 --> 01:56:10,302
Good-bye Erik.

1201
01:56:44,118 --> 01:56:46,168
You sure you should let them go?

1202
01:56:47,608 --> 01:56:48,208
<i> Yes. </i>

1203
01:56:49,008 --> 01:56:50,847
<i> I have hope for them. </i>

1204
01:56:51,965 --> 01:56:54,059
<i> It's going to be a time Hank. </i>

1205
01:56:54,060 --> 01:56:55,888
When we're all together.

1206
01:56:59,990 --> 01:57:01,610
<i> What about Logan? </i>

1207
01:58:31,875 --> 01:58:34,200
Good morning Logan.
Late start. Hah hah ha.

1208
01:58:44,584 --> 01:58:46,752
<i> Have a good lunch time. Good job. </i>

1209
01:58:46,838 --> 01:58:48,777
-Thank you.
-Very good job.

1210
01:58:50,226 --> 01:58:51,151
<i> Storm. </i>

1211
01:59:22,563 --> 01:59:23,231
Jean.

1212
01:59:25,200 --> 01:59:26,049
Hi Logan.

1213
01:59:28,871 --> 01:59:29,928
Are you okay?

1214
01:59:32,189 --> 01:59:33,061
You're here.

1215
01:59:34,205 --> 01:59:35,308
Where else would I be?

1216
01:59:38,654 --> 01:59:39,443
Woh.

1217
01:59:40,438 --> 01:59:41,438
Easy pal.

1218
01:59:44,154 --> 01:59:45,390
Some things never change.

1219
01:59:47,944 --> 01:59:48,971
Good to see you Scott.

1220
01:59:51,337 --> 01:59:52,056
Ah ha.

1221
01:59:52,373 --> 01:59:53,444
See you later Jean.

1222
01:59:57,747 --> 01:59:58,712
Professor.

1223
01:59:59,784 --> 02:00:00,424
Logan.

1224
02:00:01,332 --> 02:00:02,413
Is everything alright?

1225
02:00:06,151 --> 02:00:06,575
Yeah.

1226
02:00:08,643 --> 02:00:10,055
Yeah I think it is.

1227
02:00:27,069 --> 02:00:27,898
You did it.

1228
02:00:28,606 --> 02:00:29,239
Did what?

1229
02:00:29,653 --> 02:00:31,321
Logan don't you have a class to teach?

1230
02:00:32,462 --> 02:00:33,169
A class?

1231
02:00:33,605 --> 02:00:34,658
To teach. What?

1232
02:00:35,041 --> 02:00:35,847
History.

1233
02:00:36,682 --> 02:00:37,355
History?

1234
02:00:39,085 --> 02:00:40,592
History I could use some help with that.

1235
02:00:41,194 --> 02:00:42,203
Help with what?

1236
02:00:42,854 --> 02:00:46,069
Pretty much everything after 1973.

1237
02:00:51,263 --> 02:00:53,822
I think history I know
is little different.

1238
02:00:55,679 --> 02:00:56,973
Welcome back.

1239
02:01:00,221 --> 02:01:01,549
It's good to see you Charles.

1240
02:01:03,439 --> 02:01:04,484
It's good to see everyone.

1241
02:01:05,091 --> 02:01:05,997
Well

1242
02:01:07,297 --> 02:01:08,726
I had a promise to keep.

1243
02:01:10,584 --> 02:01:13,747
You and I have lot of catching up to do.

1244
02:01:14,762 --> 02:01:15,323
Yes.

1245
02:01:19,946 --> 02:01:21,695
What is the last thing you remember?

1246
02:01:27,110 --> 02:01:28,044
Drowning.

1247
02:01:37,241 --> 02:01:38,444
<i> The past </i>

1248
02:01:39,781 --> 02:01:42,637
<i> a new and uncertain world. </i>

1249

<i> A world of endless possibilities. </i>

1250
02:01:59,327 --> 02:02:01,503
