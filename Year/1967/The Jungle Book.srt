48
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:18,732
Shere Khan will surely kill the boy

49

Now, are we all in agreement
as to what must be done?

00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:28,364
Now it is my unpleasant duty

Uh, come over here, please.

Yes, Akela?

The council
has reached its decision.

54
00:06:35,615 --> 00:06:38,846
The man cub can no longer
stay with the pack.

55
00:06:38,935 --> 00:06:40,368
He must leave at once.

56
00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:42,047
"Leave"?

57
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:45,571
I'm sorry, Rama.
There is no other way.

58
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:48,374
But... But the man cub is...

59
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:50,207
Well, he's like my own son.

60
00:06:50,295 --> 00:06:53,128
Surely he's entitled
to the protection of the pack.

61
00:06:53,215 --> 00:06:55,524
But, Rama, even the strength
of the pack

62
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:57,606
is no match for the tiger.

63
00:06:57,695 --> 00:07:01,051
[Rama] But the boy cannot
survive alone in the jungle.

64
00:07:01,135 --> 00:07:03,808

I can be of help.

You, Bagheera? How?

66
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,492

where he'll be safe.

Mowgli and I have taken many walks
into the jungle together.

68
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,086
I'm sure he'll go with me.

69
00:07:16,175 --> 00:07:19,053
So be it. Now there's no time to lose.

70
00:07:19,735 --> 00:07:21,407
Good luck.

71
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:37,609
Bagheera, I'm getting a little sleepy.

72
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:39,287
Shouldn't we start back home?

73
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:43,084
Mowgli, this time
we're not going back.

74
00:07:44,455 --> 00:07:47,891
- I'm taking you to a man-village.
- But why?

75
00:07:47,975 --> 00:07:52,253
Because Shere Khan has returned
to this part of the jungle...

76
00:07:52,895 --> 00:07:54,567
...and he has sworn to kill you.

77
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:57,123
Kill me?
But why would he want to do that?

78
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,811
He hates man.

79
00:07:59,895 --> 00:08:03,649
Shere Khan is not going to allow you
to grow up to become a man,

80
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:05,532
just another hunter with a gun.

81
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:09,494
Aw, we'll just explain to him
that I'd never do a thing like that.

82
00:08:09,575 --> 00:08:13,170
Nonsense. No one explains
anything to Shere Khan.

83
00:08:13,255 --> 00:08:16,372
Well, maybe so,
but I'm not afraid.

84
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:19,367
- And besides, I...
- Now, that's enough.

00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,888

He hates man with a vengeance.
You know that.

685
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,608
Because he fears man's gun
and man's fire.

686
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,414
But little Mowgli
don't have those things.

687
00:40:49,495 --> 00:40:52,328
Shere Khan won't wait until he does.

688
00:40:52,415 --> 00:40:56,010
He'll get Mowgli while
he's young and helpless.

689
00:40:56,095 --> 00:40:57,767
Just one swipe and...

690
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,049
Ohh!

691
00:40:59,135 --> 00:41:01,933
Well... Well, what are we gonna do?

692
00:41:02,015 --> 00:41:03,892
We'll do what's best for the boy.

693
00:41:03,975 --> 00:41:06,489
You better believe it.
You name it, and I'll do it.

694
00:41:06,575 --> 00:41:10,090
Good. Then make Mowgli
go to the man-village.

695
00:41:10,175 --> 00:41:11,403
Are you out of your mind?

696
00:41:11,495 --> 00:41:14,248
I promised him he could stay here
in the jungle with me.

697
00:41:14,335 --> 00:41:16,053
That's just the point.

698
00:41:16,135 --> 00:41:19,047
As long as he remains with you,
he's in danger.

699
00:41:19,135 --> 00:41:21,603
- So it's up to you.
- Why me?

700
00:41:21,695 --> 00:41:24,334
[Stammers] Because
he won't listen to me.

701
00:41:25,215 --> 00:41:27,809
I love that kid. [sniffles]

702
00:41:27,895 --> 00:41:29,726
I love him like he was my own cub.

703
00:41:29,815 --> 00:41:33,091
Then think of what's best
for Mowgli and not yourself.

704
00:41:33,175 --> 00:41:35,291
Uh, well, can't...

705
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:37,093
Can't I wait until morning?

706
00:41:37,175 --> 00:41:38,813
It's morning now.

707
00:41:41,575 --> 00:41:42,849
Go on, Baloo.

708
00:41:44,255 --> 00:41:45,404
[Sighs]

709
00:41:48,775 --> 00:41:49,969

Oh, boy.

713
00:42:07,615 --> 00:42:10,049
Mowgli. Mowgli.

714
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:12,924
Uh, it's time to get up.

715
00:42:13,015 --> 00:42:16,371
[Yawns] Oh. Hi, Baloo.

716
00:42:16,455 --> 00:42:17,968
Hi.

717
00:42:18,055 --> 00:42:21,889
Hey, rub that ol' sleep
outta your eyes.

718
00:42:21,975 --> 00:42:25,092
You and me, we got
a long walk ahead of us.

719
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:28,372
Swell. Gee, we'll have
lots of fun together.

720
00:42:29,535 --> 00:42:32,254
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

721
00:42:32,335 --> 00:42:35,645
Uh, all right,
let's hit the trail, kid.

722
00:42:36,975 --> 00:42:39,694
See ya around, uh, Bagheera.

723
00:42:39,775 --> 00:42:41,845
Well, goodbye, Bagheera.

724
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:44,495
Me and Baloo,
we've got things to do.

725
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:46,372
Goodbye, Man Cub...

726
00:42:47,255 --> 00:42:48,608
...and good luck.

727
00:42:48,695 --> 00:42:50,253
Come on, Baloo.

728
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:52,132

729
00:42:52,215 --> 00:42:55,491

Well, it's sorta new and, uh...

Oh, I don't care,
as long as I'm with you.

742
00:43:30,335 --> 00:43:35,045
Mowgli, uh, look, buddy, uh,
there's somethin' I gotta tell ya.

743
00:43:35,135 --> 00:43:36,409
Tell me what, Baloo?

744
00:43:36,495 --> 00:43:38,645
Oh, gee whiz.

745
00:43:40,455 --> 00:43:43,606
Now, how did ol' Baggy put it?
It's, uh...

746
00:43:43,695 --> 00:43:47,244
Uh, uh, Mowgli... [chuckles]

747
00:43:47,335 --> 00:43:49,690
You wouldn't marry
a panther, would ya?

748
00:43:49,775 --> 00:43:53,051
[Laughing] Gee, I don't even know
what you're talking about.

[Growls]

750
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:57,526
Mowgli, don't you realize
that you're a human?

751
00:43:57,615 --> 00:44:00,573
I'm not anymore, Baloo.
I'm a bear like you.

752
00:44:00,655 --> 00:44:03,772
- Little buddy, look, listen to me.
- Come on, Baloo!

753
00:44:03,855 --> 00:44:06,688
- Mowgli, stop it now. Hold still.
- [Growling]

754
00:44:06,775 --> 00:44:09,084
I wanna tell you something.
Now listen to me.

755
00:44:09,175 --> 00:44:11,735
What's the matter, ol' Papa Bear?

756
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:15,285
Look, Mowgli, I've been tryin'
all morning to tell ya,

757
00:44:15,375 --> 00:44:18,606
I've got to take you back
to the man-village.

758
00:44:18,695 --> 00:44:21,732
- The man-village?
- Now, look, kid, I can explain.

759
00:44:21,815 --> 00:44:25,251
- But you said we were partners.
- Now, believe me, kid, I...

760
00:44:25,335 --> 00:44:28,566
- You're just like old Bagheera.
- Now just a minute!

761
00:44:28,655 --> 00:44:30,407
That's goin' too far!

762
00:44:32,615 --> 00:44:34,333
Hey, Mowgli! Where you goin'?

763
00:44:35,935 --> 00:44:37,971
Wait a minute! Stop!

764
00:44:38,975 --> 00:44:40,454
Wait!

765
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:43,854
Wait! Listen to ol' Baloo!

766
00:44:43,935 --> 00:44:45,209
Mowgli!

00:44:46,015 --> 00:44:47,130
Mowgli!

Mowgli!

Mowgli. Mowgli!

770
00:44:55,575 --> 00:44:56,849
Now what's happened?

771
00:44:56,935 --> 00:44:59,529
Well, y-you're not
gonna believe me, Bagheera,

772
00:44:59,615 --> 00:45:03,733
but look, now, I used the same words
you did, and he ran out on me!

773
00:45:03,815 --> 00:45:05,726
Well, don't just stand there.

774
00:45:05,815 --> 00:45:09,091
Let's separate. We've got to find him!

775
00:45:09,175 --> 00:45:13,851
Oh, if anything happens to that
little guy, I'll never forgive myself.

776
00:45:13,935 --> 00:45:15,334
I gotta find him.

- Different, entirely.

no different than our own son.

Now you help find him

you will sound your trumpet three times.

856
00:49:53,255 --> 00:49:54,324
Yes, sir.

857
00:49:54,415 --> 00:49:56,929
- [Trumpeting]
- [Hathi] Shh!

858
00:49:57,015 --> 00:49:58,733
Not now, soldier.

859
00:49:58,815 --> 00:50:00,407
[Nasal] Sorry, sir.

860
00:50:01,095 --> 00:50:04,929
Lieutenant, our strategy shall be
the element of surprise.

861
00:50:05,015 --> 00:50:09,725
[Whispering] You will take one squad
and cover the right flank.

862
00:50:09,815 --> 00:50:11,009
[Lieutenant] Yes, sir.

863
00:50:11,095 --> 00:50:15,611
[Whispering] And I shall meet
the other squad on the left flank.

864
00:50:16,495 --> 00:50:17,610
Very well.

865
00:50:17,695 --> 00:50:19,367
[Shouting] Company...

866
00:50:19,455 --> 00:50:21,810
[shout echoing]

867
00:50:21,895 --> 00:50:24,534
...forward... march!

868
00:50:33,615 --> 00:50:35,651
Element of surprise?

869
00:50:35,735 --> 00:50:38,044
Oh, I say.

870
00:50:38,135 --> 00:50:39,409
[Chuckling]

871
00:50:40,135 --> 00:50:42,774
And now for my rendezvous

872
00:50:42,855 --> 00:50:44,846
with the little lost man cub.

873
00:52:08,775 --> 00:52:10,686
Kaa! It's you!

874
00:52:11,255 --> 00:52:13,530
Yes-s-s, Man Cub.

875
00:52:13,615 --> 00:52:16,413
So nice to see you again.

876
00:52:16,495 --> 00:52:18,531
[Giggling, hissing]

877
00:52:18,615 --> 00:52:21,413
Oh, go away. Leave me alone.

878
00:52:22,215 --> 00:52:24,854
Let me look at you.

879
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:29,367
You don't want me to look at you?

880
00:52:29,975 --> 00:52:32,170
Then you look at me.

881
00:52:33,015 --> 00:52:35,973
No, sir. I know
what you're trying to do, Kaa.

882
00:52:36,055 --> 00:52:37,090
You do?

883
00:52:37,175 --> 00:52:40,611
Uh, I mean, you don't trust me.

884
00:52:40,695 --> 00:52:44,973
- No.
- Then there's nothing I can do to help.

885
00:52:45,055 --> 00:52:47,046
You want to help me?

886
00:52:47,135 --> 00:52:49,603
[Hisses] Certainly.

887
00:52:49,695 --> 00:52:51,128
I can see to it...

888
00:52:51,215 --> 00:52:54,571
...that you never have
to leave this jungle.

889
00:52:55,535 --> 00:52:56,809
How could you do that?

890
00:52:56,895 --> 00:52:58,567
Hmm?

891
00:52:58,655 --> 00:53:01,123
Oh, I have my own...

892
00:53:01,215 --> 00:53:05,527
...s- s-subtle little ways. [chuckles]

893
00:53:06,015 --> 00:53:09,974
But first, you must trust me.

894
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:13,046
I don't trust anyone anymore.

895
00:53:14,335 --> 00:53:16,326
I don't blame you.

896
00:53:17,055 --> 00:53:19,091
I'm not like those so-called

897
00:53:19,175 --> 00:53:22,247

898
00:53:22,335 --> 00:53:25,407
You can believe in me.

I'll be right down.

Yes? Yes? Who is it?

923
00:55:01,415 --> 00:55:03,724
It's me, Shere Khan.

00:55:03,815 --> 00:55:06,249
Uh, I'd like a word with you,
if you don't mind.

925
00:55:06,335 --> 00:55:11,170
Shere Khan.
What a s-s-surprise.

926
00:55:11,255 --> 00:55:15,487
Yes, isn't it? I just dropped by.

927
00:55:15,575 --> 00:55:17,725
Forgive me if I've interrupted anything.

928
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,771
Oh, no, no. Nothing at all.

929
00:55:19,855 --> 00:55:23,768
I thought perhaps you were entertaining
someone up there in your coils.

930
00:55:23,855 --> 00:55:26,164
Coils? Someone? Oh, no.

931
00:55:26,255 --> 00:55:29,884
I was just curling up for my siesta.

932
00:55:29,975 --> 00:55:31,806
But you were singing to someone.

933
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:35,683
- Who is it, Kaa?
- [Gulps] Uh, who?

934
00:55:35,775 --> 00:55:37,572
[Coughs] Oh, no.

935
00:55:37,655 --> 00:55:42,775
- I was just singing to myself.
- Indeed.

936
00:55:42,855 --> 00:55:47,804
Yes. Yes, you see,
I have trouble with my s-s-sinuses.

937
00:55:47,895 --> 00:55:51,649
- What a pity.
- Oh, you have no idea.

938
00:55:51,735 --> 00:55:54,932
It's simply terrible. I can't eat.

939
00:55:55,015 --> 00:56:00,135
I can't s-s-sleep,
so I sing myself to sleep.

940
00:56:00,215 --> 00:56:03,844
You know, self-hypnosis?

941
00:56:03,935 --> 00:56:07,245
Let me show you how it works.

00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:14,847
- [muffled coughs]
- I can't be bothered with that.

944
00:56:14,935 --> 00:56:16,926
I have no time
for that sort of nonsense.

945
00:56:17,015 --> 00:56:20,928
- [Hisses] Some other time, perhaps?
- Perhaps.

946
00:56:21,015 --> 00:56:23,734
But at the moment
I am searching for a man cub.

947
00:56:23,815 --> 00:56:25,965
"Man cub"? What man cub?

948
00:56:26,055 --> 00:56:28,489
The one who's lost.

949
00:56:28,575 --> 00:56:30,691
Now, where do you suppose he could be?

950
00:56:30,775 --> 00:56:32,925
Search me.

951
00:56:33,015 --> 00:56:35,449
That's an excellent idea. [chuckling]

952
00:56:35,535 --> 00:56:38,652
I'm sure you wouldn't mind
showing me your coils, would you, Kaa?

953
00:56:38,735 --> 00:56:41,249
Uh, [hisses] certainly not.

954
00:56:42,855 --> 00:56:44,811
Nothing here,

955
00:56:44,895 --> 00:56:47,329

00:56:56,695 --> 00:56:59,607
Hmm. Indeed.

960
00:57:00,535 --> 00:57:03,003
And now, how about the middle?

961
00:57:03,095 --> 00:57:04,608
The middle?

962
00:57:05,735 --> 00:57:07,805
Oh, the middle.

963
00:57:12,495 --> 00:57:15,328
[Laughing] Absolutely
nothing in the middle.

964
00:57:15,415 --> 00:57:17,087
Hmm.

965
00:57:18,055 --> 00:57:19,454
Really?

966
00:57:20,495 --> 00:57:23,692
Well, if you do just happen
to see the man cub,

967
00:57:23,775 --> 00:57:26,164
you will inform me first.

968
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:31,092
- Understand?
- [Gulps] I get the point.

969
00:57:31,175 --> 00:57:34,531
- Cross my heart, hope to die.
- Good show.

970
00:57:34,615 --> 00:57:39,245
And I must continue my search
for the helpless little lad.

971
00:57:41,255 --> 00:57:44,133
Ooh, who does he think he's fooling?

972
00:57:44,215 --> 00:57:45,967
"Helpless little lad."

973
00:57:46,055 --> 00:57:49,604
Ooh, he gives me the s-s-shivers.

974
00:57:52,015 --> 00:57:55,530
Picking on that poor little
helpless boy. [sighs]

975
00:57:57,575 --> 00:57:59,452
Oh, yes.

976
00:57:59,535 --> 00:58:02,572
The poor little helpless boy.

977
00:58:04,215 --> 00:58:05,284
Aaah!

[Grunts, groans]

979
00:58:11,055 --> 00:58:14,127
You told me a lie, Kaa.
You said I could trust you.

980
00:58:14,215 --> 00:58:16,809
It's like you said.

981
00:58:16,895 --> 00:58:20,604
You can't trust anyone.

982
00:58:25,855 --> 00:58:29,928
If I never see that
skinny little shrimp again,

983
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,846
it will be too soon.

984
00:58:33,775 --> 00:58:38,132
Ooh, my s-s-sacroiliac.

Hey, Flaps. What we gonna do?

988
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,411
I don't know. What do you wanna do?

989
00:59:02,415 --> 00:59:05,373
I've got it! Let's flap over
to the east side of the jungle.

990
00:59:05,455 --> 00:59:08,572
They've always got a bit of action,
a bit of a swingin' scene.

991
00:59:08,655 --> 00:59:11,294
Aw, come off it!
Things are right dead all over.

992
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:13,843
You mean you wish they were.

00:59:16,255 --> 00:59:17,813
Very funny.

995
00:59:19,815 --> 00:59:22,045
OK, so what we gonna do?

996
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,527
I don't know. What do you wanna do?

997
00:59:25,615 --> 00:59:28,448
Look, Flaps, first I say,
"What we gonna do?"

998
00:59:28,535 --> 00:59:30,844
Then you say, "I don't know.
What do you wanna do?"

999
00:59:30,935 --> 00:59:32,812
"What we gonna do?"
"What you wanna do?"

00:59:32,895 --> 00:59:34,886
What we gonna do, what you want...
Let's do something!

1001
00:59:34,975 --> 00:59:37,443
OK. What do you want to do?

1002
00:59:37,535 --> 00:59:39,651
Oh, blimey. There you go again.

1003
00:59:39,735 --> 00:59:41,453
The same notes again.

1004
00:59:41,535 --> 00:59:45,289
I've got it!
This time, I've really got it.

1005
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:48,094
So you've got it.
So what we gonna do?

1006
00:59:48,175 --> 00:59:52,248
Hold it, lads.
Look. Look what's coming our way.

1007
00:59:52,335 --> 00:59:54,530
Hey, what in the world is that?

1008
00:59:56,775 --> 00:59:58,970
What a crazy looking bunch of bones.

1009
00:59:59,055 --> 01:00:02,013
Yeah, and they're all
walking about by themselves.

1010
01:00:02,095 --> 01:00:03,733
[All laughing]

1011
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:09,931
- So what we gonna do?
- I don't know.

1012
01:00:10,015 --> 01:00:12,131
Hey, now, don't start that again.

1013
01:00:12,215 --> 01:00:13,568
Come on, lads. Come on.

1014
01:00:13,655 --> 01:00:17,045
Let's have some fun with this
little fella, this little bloke, eh?

1015
01:00:28,335 --> 01:00:31,611
Blimey! He's got legs
like a stork, he has.

1016
01:00:31,695 --> 01:00:34,732
Like a stork. Ha ha!
But he ain't got no feathers, he ain't.

1017
01:00:34,815 --> 01:00:36,487
[Laughter]

1018
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:41,969
Go ahead. Laugh. I don't care.

1019
01:00:44,895 --> 01:00:46,453
[Thunder rumbling]

1020
01:00:48,015 --> 01:00:49,687
What's wrong with him?

1021
01:00:49,775 --> 01:00:51,208
I think we overdid it.

1022
01:00:51,295 --> 01:00:53,934
We were just having
a bit of fun, that's all.

1023
01:00:54,015 --> 01:00:57,803
Oh, just look at him.
Why, the poor little fella.

1024
01:00:58,815 --> 01:01:00,965
You know, he must be
down on his luck.

1025
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:04,206
Yeah, or he wouldn't be
in our neighbourhood.

1026
01:01:05,575 --> 01:01:08,009
Hey, new kid! Wait a minute! Hey!

1027
01:01:08,095 --> 01:01:09,847
Just leave me alone.

1028
01:01:09,935 --> 01:01:12,085
Oh, come on. What's wrong?

1029
01:01:12,175 --> 01:01:15,008
You look like you haven't got
a friend in the world.

1030
01:01:15,095 --> 01:01:18,644
- I haven't.
- Haven't you got a mother or a father?

1031
01:01:18,735 --> 01:01:20,805
No. Nobody wants me around.

1032
01:01:20,895 --> 01:01:23,693
Yeah. We know how you feel.

1033
01:01:23,775 --> 01:01:25,891
Nobody wants us around either.

1034
01:01:25,975 --> 01:01:29,729
Oh, we may look a bit shabby,
but we've got hearts.

1035
01:01:29,815 --> 01:01:31,373
And feelings too.

1036
01:01:31,455 --> 01:01:33,366
And just to prove it to you,

1037
01:01:33,455 --> 01:01:36,174
we're going to let you
join our little group.

1038
01:01:36,255 --> 01:01:39,770
Kid, we'd like to make you
an honorary vulture.

1039
01:01:39,855 --> 01:01:43,291
Thanks, but I...
I'd rather be on my own alone.

1040
01:01:43,375 --> 01:01:44,854
Oh, now, look, kid.

1041
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:46,971
Everybody's got to have friends.

1042
01:01:48,215 --> 01:01:51,695

Why should you run?

1089
01:04:16,575 --> 01:04:19,328
Could it be possible
that you don't know who I am?

I know you, all right.

1091

- You're Shere Khan.
- Precisely.

1092
01:04:24,335 --> 01:04:29,011
Then you should also know
that everyone runs from Shere Khan.

1093
01:04:30,455 --> 01:04:33,606
You don't scare me.
I won't run from anyone.

1094

Ah! You have spirit for one so small,

1095
01:04:37,895 --> 01:04:42,173
and such spirit is deserving
of a sporting chance.

my eyes and count to ten.

Fire! That's the only thing
Old Stripes is afraid of.

1127
01:06:28,335 --> 01:06:30,610
You get the fire. We'll do the rest.

1128

like a flaming comet, he did.

Well, come on. Let's go
congratulate our friend.

1143

Hold it, fellas.

1144
01:07:23,135 --> 01:07:26,286
Now is not the time for it. Look.

1145
01:07:32,575 --> 01:07:33,928
Baloo?

1146
01:07:42,215 --> 01:07:43,330
Baloo, get up.

1147
01:07:44,135 --> 01:07:46,046
Oh, please, get up.

1148
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:53,289
[Sniffs] Oh.

1149
01:07:56,855 --> 01:07:59,733
Mowgli, try to understand.

1150
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:02,843
Bagheera, what's the matter with him?

1151
01:08:02,935 --> 01:08:06,132
You've got to be brave,
like Baloo was.

1152
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:08,570
You... You don't mean...

1153
01:08:09,415 --> 01:08:12,248
Oh, no. Baloo.

Now, now. I know how you feel.

1156
01:08:23,695 --> 01:08:25,651
But you must remember, Mowgli,

1157
01:08:26,655 --> 01:08:29,328
"Greater love hath no one

1158
01:08:29,415 --> 01:08:33,010
than he who lays down his life
for his friend."

1159
01:08:34,335 --> 01:08:35,814
When great deeds

1160
01:08:35,895 --> 01:08:37,647
are remembered in this jungle,

1161
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:41,764
one name will stand above all others:

1162
01:08:42,455 --> 01:08:46,368
Our friend, Baloo the bear.

1163
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,527
[Sniffling] He's crackin' me up.

1164
01:08:49,615 --> 01:08:52,891
The memory of Baloo's
sacrifice and bravery

1165
01:08:52,975 --> 01:08:57,014
will forever be engraved
on our saddened hearts.

1166
01:08:57,095 --> 01:08:58,972
Beautiful.

1167
01:08:59,055 --> 01:09:02,968
This spot where Baloo fell
will always be

1168
01:09:03,055 --> 01:09:06,092
a hallowed place in the jungle,

1169
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:10,532

noblest creatures.

could have heard this.

Come along, Man Cub.

1174
01:09:21,815 --> 01:09:24,852
Hey, don't stop now, Baggy.
You're doin' great!

1175
01:09:24,935 --> 01:09:27,733
There's more. Lots more!

- Baloo, you're all right!
- [Chuckles]

1180
01:09:38,415 --> 01:09:41,327
Who, me? Sure I am.

1181
01:09:41,415 --> 01:09:43,690
Never felt... better.

[Laughter]

1183
01:09:47,575 --> 01:09:52,126
- You sure had us worried.
- Aw, I was just takin' five.

You know, playin' it cool.

1185
01:09:55,095 --> 01:09:58,531
- [Chuckling] But he was too easy.
- Good old Papa Bear.

1186
01:09:58,615 --> 01:10:02,210
It's going to be a bit dull
without the little bloke, isn't it?

1187
01:10:02,295 --> 01:10:04,763
Yeah. So what we gonna do?

1188
01:10:04,855 --> 01:10:08,052
I don't know...
Now, don't start that again!

1189
01:10:09,415 --> 01:10:11,883
Hey, Baggy.
Too bad you missed the action.

1190
01:10:11,975 --> 01:10:14,250
You should have seen
how I made a sucker

1191
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:16,895
out of Old Stripes
with that left up in his face.

1192
01:10:16,975 --> 01:10:19,125
"Boom, boom," I was givin' him. "Wham!"

1193
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,854
Wanna know somethin'?
We're good sparring partners.

1194
01:10:21,935 --> 01:10:25,325
- [Laughs] You'd better believe it.
- Yes, sir.

1195
01:10:25,415 --> 01:10:29,533
Nothing or nobody is ever
gonna come between us again.

1201
01:10:48,775 --> 01:10:52,768
- Oh, it's the man-village.
- No, no. I mean that.

1202
01:10:54,415 --> 01:10:58,169
Forget about those.
They ain't nothing but trouble.

1203
01:10:58,255 --> 01:11:01,691
Just a minute.
I've never seen one before.

1204
01:11:01,775 --> 01:11:04,573
So you've seen one. So let's go.

1205
01:11:04,655 --> 01:11:07,931
I'll be right back.
I want a better look.

1206
01:11:08,015 --> 01:11:11,007
- Mowgli, wait a minute!
- Oh, Baloo.

1207
01:11:11,095 --> 01:11:12,767
Let him have a better look.

1208

Oh!

1226
01:12:43,375 --> 01:12:46,924
- She did that on purpose!
- Obviously.

Go on. Go on.

1230
01:13:49,535 --> 01:13:52,208
He's hooked.

1231
01:13:52,295 --> 01:13:54,490
Ah, it was inevitable, Baloo.

1232
01:13:54,575 --> 01:13:56,486
The boy couldn't help himself.

1233
01:13:56,575 --> 01:13:58,531
It was bound to happen.

1234
01:13:58,615 --> 01:14:00,845
Mowgli is where he belongs now.

1235
01:14:02,655 --> 01:14:03,690
Yeah.

1236
01:14:04,535 --> 01:14:06,014
I guess you're right.

he'd have made one swell bear.

Well, come on, Baggy, buddy.

1239
01:14:14,975 --> 01:14:17,091
