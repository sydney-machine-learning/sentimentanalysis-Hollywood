1
00:01:53,377 --> 00:01:57,017
God, she's beautiful.
She's got the prettiest eyes.

2
00:01:57,137 --> 00:01:59,498
She looks so sexy in that sweater.

3
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:03,620
I just want to be alone with her
and hold her and kiss her

4
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,702
and tell her how much l love her
and take care of her.

5
00:02:07,822 --> 00:02:10,583
Stop it, you idiot!
She's your wife's sister.

6
00:02:10,704 --> 00:02:15,786
l can't help it. l'm consumed by her.
lt's been months now.

7
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:19,265
l dream about her,
l think about her at the office.

8
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:23,028
Oh, Lee. What am l gonna do?

9
00:02:24,108 --> 00:02:27,869
l hear myself mooning over you,
and it's disgusting.

10
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,791
Before, when she squeezed
past me in the doorway

11
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:34,351
and l smelt that perfume
on the back ofher neck...

12
00:02:34,472 --> 00:02:37,233
Jesus, l thought l was gonna swoon.

13
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:43,236
Easy. You're a dignified financial advisor.
lt doesn't look good for you to swoon.

14
00:02:43,356 --> 00:02:44,676
Elliot?

15
00:02:44,837 --> 00:02:47,277
- Elliot? Sweetheart?
- Mm?

16
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:51,319
Have you tried these? They're wonderful.
Holly and her friend made them.

17
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,480
Fantastic. Your sister
is an unbelievable cook.

18
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,361
l know, l know.
She has all the cooking talent.

19
00:02:57,521 --> 00:03:00,322
- No, you've got tons as well.
- l've eaten five of these.

20
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:04,044
- Holly, why don't you open a restaurant?
- Mm, we practically are.

21
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:08,886
Well... not a restaurant, but...
April and l are gonna do some catering.

22
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:11,246
- What? You're kidding.
- No, we decided.

23
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:13,166
Perfect.

24
00:03:13,288 --> 00:03:16,448
We like to cook for friends, so...
until an acting job comes through,

25
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:18,769
we could make money
doing private parties.

26
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:22,811
- Great idea. That's where your talent lies.
- l know.

27
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:25,172
Get outta here.
Could l speak to you privately?

28
00:03:25,292 --> 00:03:27,372
l'm her husband. She tells me anything.

29
00:03:28,453 --> 00:03:30,613
Hannah, l need more money.
Don't get upset.

30
00:03:30,734 --> 00:03:33,455
- l never get upset over that.
- This is the last time.

31
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:36,376
- l'm keeping strict accounts.
- Please, don't insult me.

32
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:39,177
- Someday l'll pay it back.
- l know. How much do you need?

33
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:41,298
- $2,000.
- Uh-huh?

34
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:45,500
l know it's a lot, but April and l have
this catering idea. lt's gonna be great.

35
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,300
You admit we're great cooks.

36
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:51,262
ln order to get started, there are a few
things to buy and some old debts to pay.

37
00:03:51,382 --> 00:03:54,062
Just tell me one thing.
Are we talking cocaine again?

38
00:03:54,183 --> 00:03:57,944
l swear. We've already got some
requests to do dinner parties.

39
00:03:58,065 --> 00:04:02,426
Obviously l'm not gonna be a caterer
for ever. We both still go on auditions.

40
00:04:02,547 --> 00:04:05,987
Something could come up at any
moment, but the parties are at night.

41
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:09,348
l can still take my acting class.
l haven't done drugs in a year.

42
00:04:09,469 --> 00:04:13,830
A whimpering, simpering child again

43
00:04:14,431 --> 00:04:18,552
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered...

44
00:04:18,913 --> 00:04:22,194
Mom and Dad are floating
down memory lane again.

45
00:04:22,314 --> 00:04:25,836
- Have you tried Holly's shrimp puffs?
- They're fantastic.

46
00:04:25,956 --> 00:04:30,277
l need an antihistamine for Mom's asthma
before she turns into Camille.

47
00:04:30,398 --> 00:04:32,318
Mom's Camille every morning.

48
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:35,720
- At least she isn't drinking.
- Doesn't she look great in that dress?

49
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,000
She knows it
cos she's flirting with the men.

50
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:42,522
When she's 80 she may stop straightening
her garter belt when there's a guy around.

51
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:47,004
- Where's the antihistamine?
- Elliot's got them somewhere.

52
00:04:47,724 --> 00:04:50,285
- Frederick didn't come with her.
- When does he ever?

53
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:53,806
He's such an angry...
He's such a depressive.

54
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:57,087
- l thought she was moving out.
- l don't know.

55
00:04:57,248 --> 00:04:59,968
A pill he is

56
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:02,490
But still he is

57
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:07,372
All mine and l'll keep him until he is

58
00:05:08,052 --> 00:05:09,692
Bewitched...

59
00:05:09,813 --> 00:05:11,694
Watch out, you guys! Beep-beep!

60
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:15,775
Your kids are so adorable.
lt gets so lonely on the holidays.

61
00:05:15,895 --> 00:05:19,216
Oh, gosh. Well, that's why
l invited Phil Gammage tonight.

62
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:22,417
- Hannah, he's such a loser.
- He's not a loser at all.

63
00:05:22,538 --> 00:05:25,738
- He's the head of Daisy's school.
- He reminds me of lchabod Crane.

64
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,620
His Adam's apple jumps up and down
when he gets excited.

65
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,661
He's a lot better than your ex-husband.
He's got a good job.

66
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,902
- He's not a dope addict.
- Give me a break.

67
00:05:34,022 --> 00:05:36,462
- Am l interrupting any sister talk?
- Mm-mm.

68
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:39,864
Good, because there are no
interesting single men at this party.

69
00:05:39,984 --> 00:05:44,906
Well, listen. Maybe April would like Phil.
Phil Gammage? The tall guy?

70
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:47,947
Oh, yeah, l met Phil.
He looks like lchabod Crane?

71
00:05:48,068 --> 00:05:50,828
l love that. That's my type. No, really!

72
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:54,350
No, we mustn't get discouraged.

73
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,711
Hannah will invite some men over
who don't look like lchabod Crane.

74
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:03,674
Maybe at Christmas, or if not Christmas,
New Year's, or maybe next New Year's.

75
00:06:03,794 --> 00:06:04,874
Ouch!

76
00:06:04,994 --> 00:06:07,194
- lt must be here someplace.
- Oh, you know?

77
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:09,596
l love that book you lent me,
The Easter Parade.

78
00:06:09,716 --> 00:06:12,316
You were right.
lt had very special meaning for me.

79
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:14,477
How's Frederick? He didn't come.

80
00:06:14,598 --> 00:06:17,198
You know. One of his moods.
But it wasn't a bad week.

81
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,399
- He sold a picture.
- Oh, great.

82
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,961
Yeah, it was one of his better drawings,
a very beautiful nude study.

83
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:24,682
Actually, it was of me.

84
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:29,003
lt's a funny feeling to know you're being
hung naked in a stranger's living room.

85
00:06:29,123 --> 00:06:32,764
But you can't tell it's me, although...
You're turning all red, Elliot.

86
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:34,925
Oh, really?

87
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:37,687
- So... what else? What are you up to?
- l don't know.

88
00:06:37,807 --> 00:06:39,768
My unemployment cheques
are running out.

89
00:06:39,888 --> 00:06:42,568
l may do a course at Columbia
with the last of my savings.

90
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:44,730
- Like...?
- l don't know, exactly.

91
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,810
Sociology, psychology, maybe...

92
00:06:46,931 --> 00:06:49,131
l always thought
l might work with children.

93
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:52,212
lncidentally, l always have
clients furnishing places.

94
00:06:52,373 --> 00:06:56,414
Someone might be interested
in buying art. Shall l call you?

95
00:06:56,574 --> 00:06:59,775
Yeah, sure. Frederick would
really be grateful for a sale.

96
00:06:59,896 --> 00:07:01,617
Hey, guys! Dinner's ready!

97
00:07:01,776 --> 00:07:03,777
You look so beautiful. Doesn't she?

98
00:07:03,938 --> 00:07:07,538
l bumped into your ex-husband on
the street the other day. He's still crazy.

99
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:11,100
- He was on his way to get a blood test.
- Mickey's such a hypochondriac.

100
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:15,101
l wonder how he'd handle if there was
ever anything really wrong with him.

101
00:07:15,221 --> 00:07:18,822
Now, ladies and gentlemen...

102
00:07:18,943 --> 00:07:21,104
Dad...

103
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:24,304
- Dad...
- No, now this is a toast...

104
00:07:24,425 --> 00:07:27,226
This is a toast. This is a toast.

105
00:07:27,746 --> 00:07:33,948
You know, this beautiful Thanksgiving
dinner was all prepared by Hannah.

106
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:36,950
l had a little help from Mavis.
Also, Holly and April...

107
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:40,671
No, no. You did it. She did it.

108
00:07:41,272 --> 00:07:43,392
And we drink to her,

109
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:48,995
and we congratulate her on her wonderful
accomplishment during this last year.

110
00:07:49,115 --> 00:07:52,036
Her great success in A Doll's House.

111
00:07:55,678 --> 00:07:58,718
l played Nora.
l'd hate to tell you what year.

112
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,920
And it's very difficult to behave
like Torvald's little chipmunk

113
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,680
without making a perfect ass
out of yourself.

114
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:10,763
Now, l think that lbsen would have been
damned proud of our Hannah.

115
00:08:10,884 --> 00:08:12,644
Speech! Speech!

116
00:08:12,764 --> 00:08:15,405
No, no. l've been very, very lucky.

117
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:17,805
When l had the kids,
l decided to stop working

118
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:21,767
and just devote myself to having
the family and l've been very happy.

119
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:25,809
But l've always secretly hoped that
maybe some little gem would come along

120
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:28,249
and tempt me back on the stage.

121
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,932
Now l got that out of my system, l can go
back to the thing that makes me happy.

122
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:35,492
Bravo! Bravo!

123
00:08:48,058 --> 00:08:51,899
ls it my imagination
or does Elliot have a little crush on me?

124
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,220
lt's funny. l've had that thought before.

125
00:08:55,341 --> 00:08:57,702
He pays a lot ofattention
to me all the time.

126
00:08:57,861 --> 00:09:01,062
And he blushed tonight
when we were alone in the bedroom.

127
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,903
l wonder ifhe and Hannah are happy.

128
00:09:04,024 --> 00:09:08,425
lt's funny. l still feel
a little buzz from his flirting.

129
00:09:13,868 --> 00:09:16,828
- You want some coffee or tea?
- No, thank you.

130
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:19,790
- How about something to eat?
- No, nothing.

131
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:22,271
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

132
00:09:22,392 --> 00:09:24,952
What am l gonna do with you? God!

133
00:09:26,272 --> 00:09:30,874
Why didn't you come tonight? We all had
a terrific time. You would have enjoyed it.

134
00:09:30,995 --> 00:09:35,276
l'm going through a period of my life
where l just can't be around people.

135
00:09:35,396 --> 00:09:39,717
- l didn't want to abuse anyone.
- You wouldn't. They're all so sweet.

136
00:09:39,838 --> 00:09:42,879
Lee, you are the only person
l can be with,

137
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,240
who l really look forward to being with.

138
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,321
You're too harsh with everyone.
You know that, don't you?

139
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:54,364
- lsn't it enough that l can love you?
- You're such a puzzle!

140
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:58,445
So sweet with me, and so
contemptuous of everyone else.

141
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,805
There was a time when you were
very happy to be only with me.

142
00:10:01,926 --> 00:10:05,527
You wanted to learn everything
about poetry, about music.

143
00:10:05,648 --> 00:10:10,090
Have l really taught you everything
l have to give? l don't think so.

144
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:17,693
Elliot said he might have
a couple of clients for you.

145
00:10:17,813 --> 00:10:20,893
l'm sure those morons he handles
have a deep feeling for art.

146
00:10:21,014 --> 00:10:24,575
You never know, they might.
He was just trying to do the nice thing.

147
00:10:24,696 --> 00:10:26,816
- Because he likes you.
- Me?

148
00:10:26,936 --> 00:10:29,577
Yeah. Elliot lusts after you.

149
00:10:29,697 --> 00:10:33,058
Based on what? You never even see him.

150
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:36,180
When you see him, you come home
full of books he's recommended,

151
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:40,261
- or films you must see.
- Oh, no, no. He's my sister's husband.

152
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:44,622
And l think if you gave him half a chance,
you'd like him. He's very intelligent.

153
00:10:44,743 --> 00:10:47,864
He's a glorified accountant
and he's after you.

154
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:53,586
And l prefer to sell my work to people
who appreciate it, not to rock stars.

155
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:56,427
You understand?

156
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,951
- Why can't we do the sketch?
- Standards and Practices say it's dirty.

157
00:11:08,112 --> 00:11:11,153
They saw the rehearsal. They just
figured out what the words mean?

158
00:11:11,314 --> 00:11:14,635
- Mickey, we got a half-hour to air.
- The show is five minutes short.

159
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:18,876
- How? We timed everything long.
- With no sketch, we're ten minutes short.

160
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:22,918
- How can they do that to us?
- lt's because our ratings are low.

161
00:11:23,038 --> 00:11:25,439
- l have a migraine.
- Hey, Mickey! Listen.

162
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:29,199
You'd better go to Ronny's dressing room.
He took about 1600 Quaaludes.

163
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:32,441
- l don't think he can do the show.
- Why me, Lord?

164
00:11:32,562 --> 00:11:36,123
You Standards and Practices?
Why is the sketch dirty?

165
00:11:36,243 --> 00:11:38,484
Child molestation is a touchy subject...

166
00:11:38,604 --> 00:11:41,444
- Half the country's doing it!
- Yes, but you name names.

167
00:11:41,565 --> 00:11:45,246
- We don't. We say ''The Pope''.
- That sketch cannot go on the air.

168
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:49,007
Hey! Who changed
my sketch about the PLO?

169
00:11:49,128 --> 00:11:51,328
l had to make cuts. lt's four lousy lines.

170
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:54,370
- The whole premise is ruined!
- lt's not so delicate.

171
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,971
- Everybody's married to every line.
- l don't care! Don't tamper with my work.

172
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,613
- OK...
- You want 'em cut? l'll cut 'em myself.

173
00:12:01,733 --> 00:12:06,254
Mickey, listen. lnstead of the child
molestation sketch, why don't we repeat

174
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,175
the Cardinal Spellman-Ronald Reagan
homosexual dance number?

175
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:13,257
- l don't feel good, Mickey.
- What did you do? Swallow a drugstore?

176
00:12:13,377 --> 00:12:15,338
- l lost my voice.
- Oh, Jesus!

177
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:18,579
Ronny, you know, you do
have to go on in 25 minutes.

178
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,701
Does anybody got a Tagamet?
My ulcer's startin' to kill me.

179
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:23,741
You want a Quaalude?

180
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:26,983
Christ, this show is ruining my health.

181
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:29,303
Meanwhile, my ex-partner
moves to California

182
00:12:29,424 --> 00:12:33,505
and every stupid show he produces
turns out to be a big hit.

183
00:12:33,626 --> 00:12:36,466
Brother, what am l gonna do with my life?

184
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:41,348
Speaking ofthat, l gotta remember
to see my ex-wife tomorrow.

185
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,430
- Hi.
- l know.

186
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:49,751
- Glad you could put in an appearance.
- l got two minutes. The show is killin' me.

187
00:12:49,872 --> 00:12:52,832
l got a million appointments today.
lt just fell this way.

188
00:12:52,953 --> 00:12:56,474
- l gotta see new comedians...
- Just two minutes on your sons' birthday.

189
00:12:56,595 --> 00:12:59,115
- lt's not gonna kill you.
- Happy birthday, fellas!

190
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:01,516
Daddy brought presents!

191
00:13:01,676 --> 00:13:05,157
Hey, a little hug? What is this?
How about a little action from the kids?

192
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,559
- How is everything?
- Everything's fine.

193
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:10,879
OK, you can open the presents now.
l wanna get a little reaction.

194
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,881
- How's Elliot?
- He's fine.

195
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:17,402
l'm trying to convince him to produce
a play. l think he'll find that satisfying.

196
00:13:17,523 --> 00:13:21,044
l like him. l think he's a sweet guy,
the few times that l've met him.

197
00:13:21,164 --> 00:13:24,686
Cos he's a loser. He's awkward
and he's clumsy, like me.

198
00:13:24,806 --> 00:13:27,687
- l like an underconfident person.
- This is really nice.

199
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,848
- He's been wanting a mitt.
- You have good taste in husbands.

200
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:33,248
Thanks. That's a beauty!

201
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:35,609
lsn't that great? Come on, let's go!

202
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:38,490
Go out by the Sung vase and catch this.

203
00:13:38,611 --> 00:13:40,251
Watch the...

204
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:45,413
Hannah's sweet, although sometimes
l still do get angry when l think ofthings.

205
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:48,975
What the hell.
At least l'm not paying child support.

206
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:51,976
God, l hope there's nothing
physically wrong with me.

207
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:55,697
- So what's the problem this time?
- l really think l have something.

208
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:58,778
l'm absolutely convinced.
Not like that adenoidal thing,

209
00:13:58,898 --> 00:14:02,019
where l didn't realise l'd had them out.
But l was younger.

210
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,861
l saw your father this week about his
sinus and he complained of chest pains.

211
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:09,663
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac
of the family. He's, you know...

212
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:12,464
- You said you'd had some dizziness.
- Yes, a little.

213
00:14:12,584 --> 00:14:15,384
And l think l'm developing
a hearing loss in my right ear.

214
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:19,987
Or my left ear. No, l'm sorry...
My right or my left ear. l can't remember.

215
00:14:20,107 --> 00:14:21,547
OK, let's take a look.

216
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:46,477
Well, you have had a significant drop in
the high-decibel range in your right ear.

217
00:14:46,597 --> 00:14:47,797
Really?

218
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:51,198
Have you been exposed to
a loud noise recently, or had a virus?

219
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:55,561
No, l've been perfectly healthy. You know
me. l always imagine that l have things.

220
00:14:55,681 --> 00:15:00,282
- When did you first notice this?
- About a month ago. What do l have?

221
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:04,724
You've had some dizzy spells.
What about ringing or buzzing?

222
00:15:04,885 --> 00:15:06,845
Yes, now that you mention it,

223
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:12,007
l have buzzing and also ringing.
Ringing and buzzing. Am l going deaf?

224
00:15:12,167 --> 00:15:14,008
- lt's just in one ear?
- Yes.

225
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:17,569
ls it healthier to have
problems in both ears?

226
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,530
l'd like to make an appointment
for you at the hospital.

227
00:15:21,651 --> 00:15:25,292
- l'd like to have them run some tests.
- The hospital? What kind of tests?

228
00:15:25,412 --> 00:15:27,452
Now, don't get alarmed.

229
00:15:27,573 --> 00:15:32,015
These are more sophisticated audiometry
tests than l can run here. lt's nothing.

230
00:15:32,135 --> 00:15:34,535
Then why do l have to go
into the hospital at all?

231
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:38,737
l hear fine. So l'm a little weak on the
high decibels. l won't go to the opera.

232
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:42,098
There's no reason for panic.
l just wanna rule out some things.

233
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:45,901
- Like what?
- lt's nothing. Will you trust me?

234
00:15:46,421 --> 00:15:51,142
Hello, Dr Wilkes? This is Mickey Sachs.
l wanna ask you a question.

235
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:55,784
- Sure, Mickey. What's up?
- lf you have a hearing loss in one ear,

236
00:15:55,905 --> 00:16:01,226
and it's not from a virus or a loud noise
or anything, what are the possibilities?

237
00:16:01,547 --> 00:16:06,988
Anything. Often it's hereditary.
Flu. Even a small noise'll do it.

238
00:16:07,109 --> 00:16:08,789
Right, but nothing worse?

239
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:13,631
Well, yes, l guess the dark side
of the spectrum is a brain tumour.

240
00:16:15,272 --> 00:16:17,152
Really?

241
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:20,434
- OK, so here's the new pages.
- Did Cards get these?

242
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:22,634
- Not yet, no.
- Let's hope it's good.

243
00:16:22,755 --> 00:16:26,676
Yeah, really, really.
We'll be down in a minute, OK?

244
00:16:26,797 --> 00:16:29,798
Mickey, what's the matter with you?

245
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:32,718
l feel dizzy, you know? l don't feel well.

246
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:35,399
Do you hear a ringing?
ls there a ringing sound?

247
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,440
Yeah, yeah. l hear it, l hear it.

248
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,881
- No, not that.
- Hello?

249
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:41,361
Yeah, we're gonna be
working late tonight.

250
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:43,402
No, we'll order out.

251
00:16:43,523 --> 00:16:45,603
lf l have a brain tumour,
what am l gonna do?

252
00:16:45,724 --> 00:16:48,765
You don't have a brain tumour.
He didn't say you had one.

253
00:16:48,885 --> 00:16:52,926
No, they're not gonna tell you because
sometimes the weaker ones will panic.

254
00:16:53,046 --> 00:16:55,246
But not you?

255
00:16:55,367 --> 00:16:59,449
- Can you hear buzzing?
- Come on, we got a show to do.

256
00:16:59,569 --> 00:17:02,769
- l can't keep my mind on the show.
- There's nothing wrong with you.

257
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:06,051
lf there isn't, why does he
want me to come back for tests?

258
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:08,812
- He has to rule out certain things.
- Like what?

259
00:17:08,973 --> 00:17:12,654
- l don't know. Cancer.
- Don't say that. l don't wanna hear that.

260
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:16,616
- Don't mention it while l'm in the building.
- You don't have any symptoms.

261
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:19,095
l got the classic symptoms
of a brain tumour.

262
00:17:19,256 --> 00:17:22,017
Two months ago you thought
you had a malignant melanoma.

263
00:17:22,178 --> 00:17:25,818
Naturally. The sudden appearance
of a black spot on my back.

264
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:30,141
- lt was on your shirt.
- Was l to know? Everyone was pointing.

265
00:17:30,261 --> 00:17:34,142
- We've got to make booking decisions.
- l can't think of it.

266
00:17:34,263 --> 00:17:37,864
This morning l was so happy.
Now l don't know what went wrong.

267
00:17:37,984 --> 00:17:39,744
You were miserable this morning.

268
00:17:39,865 --> 00:17:43,226
We got bad reviews, terrible ratings,
the sponsors are furious...

269
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:46,787
No, l was happy, but l just
didn't realise l was happy.

270
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:53,390
These are delicious!
What are they?

271
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,791
- Those are quail eggs. Aren't they good?
- They're very good.

272
00:17:56,912 --> 00:17:59,472
My friend April makes those.
Try a shrimp puff.

273
00:17:59,592 --> 00:18:02,553
- Oh, thank you. That looks good.
- l make those.

274
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:04,794
Excuse me.

275
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:06,555
Oh, thank you.

276
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:09,876
- The stroganoff is ready.
- We're a big hit!

277
00:18:09,997 --> 00:18:13,877
ln this we are. Yesterday l auditioned for
Come Back Little Sheba. Not such a hit.

278
00:18:13,998 --> 00:18:16,559
You will be. You'll get five jobs next week.

279
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:20,480
- Excuse me. Are there any more clams?
- Yeah, a few. Do you like 'em?

280
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,081
- l can't resist.
- Really? How flattering.

281
00:18:23,201 --> 00:18:26,723
- Did you try the shrimp puffs?
- You are too attractive to be caterers.

282
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:28,803
- Something's wrong.
- We're actresses.

283
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:31,405
- ls this your first job?
- ls the food that bad?

284
00:18:31,525 --> 00:18:32,644
No, not at all.

285
00:18:32,766 --> 00:18:36,047
We need more bread and
bechamel sauce for the lasagne. Hi.

286
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,687
You're an actress with
a great flair for shrimp puffs.

287
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:42,769
No, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.
l do the crepes caviare.

288
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,651
- The quail is responsible for the eggs?
- Let's hope so.

289
00:18:45,771 --> 00:18:48,532
Here, l stole you a couple of extra clams.

290
00:18:48,652 --> 00:18:52,493
- lncidentally, l'm David Tolchin.
- Oh, April Knox. Hi.

291
00:18:52,613 --> 00:18:53,653
- You're Holly?
- Yeah.

292
00:18:53,773 --> 00:18:55,973
We're the Stanislavski Catering Company.

293
00:18:56,134 --> 00:19:00,576
Now l'm gonna tell you the truth. l really
came in because l was bored by the party.

294
00:19:00,696 --> 00:19:02,416
How are we more interesting?

295
00:19:02,537 --> 00:19:05,577
Actually, l'm gonna listen to Aida,
if l'm not in your way.

296
00:19:05,738 --> 00:19:06,858
Oh, no.

297
00:19:06,978 --> 00:19:10,699
We saw Pavarotti in Ernani
at the Met, and l cried.

298
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,580
l cry at the opera.

299
00:19:12,741 --> 00:19:15,782
l go limp in the last
scene of La Traviata.

300
00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:18,583
Me too. l have a private box at the Met.

301
00:19:18,703 --> 00:19:22,824
l bring a bottle of wine. l open it, l sit
there, l watch and l cry. lt's disgusting.

302
00:19:22,985 --> 00:19:25,225
- What do you do?
- l'm an architect.

303
00:19:25,345 --> 00:19:28,146
- What kind of things do you build?
- Are you interested?

304
00:19:28,307 --> 00:19:30,227
Yeah.

305
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:32,309
What time do you get off?

306
00:19:34,189 --> 00:19:36,710
- The red one?
- lt's magnificent!

307
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,511
The design's deliberately
noncontextual, but l wanted

308
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:44,473
to keep the atmosphere of the street,
and the proportions, and in the material.

309
00:19:44,593 --> 00:19:48,074
- That's unpolished red granite.
- ls that what it is?

310
00:19:48,195 --> 00:19:50,635
- lt has an organic quality about it.
- Right.

311
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:55,037
Almost entirely, wholly interdependent,
if you know what l mean.

312
00:19:55,157 --> 00:19:59,518
l can't put it into words.
The important thing is, it breathes.

313
00:19:59,639 --> 00:20:03,041
You know, people pass by vital
structures in this city all the time

314
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:07,242
and never appreciate them. l get the
feeling you tune into your environment.

315
00:20:07,362 --> 00:20:09,562
Oh, it's really important.

316
00:20:09,683 --> 00:20:12,204
- What are your favourite buildings?
- Wanna see some?

317
00:20:12,324 --> 00:20:14,604
- Yeah.
- Well, let's do it.

318
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,742
lt's just so romantic.
l just wanna put on a long gown

319
00:20:59,863 --> 00:21:02,744
and open the French doors
and go on the balcony.

320
00:21:02,864 --> 00:21:07,385
lt's romantic. And it's got a
handsome partner sitting right beside it.

321
00:21:07,506 --> 00:21:11,547
They fit right in together. And your eye
goes along, lulled into complacency,

322
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:15,828
- and then... look at this.
- That's disgusting. A monstrosity.

323
00:21:15,989 --> 00:21:19,070
lt's really terrible,
and it ruins everything else.

324
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:22,791
- lt does.
- We have seen a lot of stuff today.

325
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:26,712
- Maybe we should start going home.
- Oh, jeez, yeah.

326
00:21:26,873 --> 00:21:31,033
- Who gets dropped first?
- Oh, gee, l don't know.

327
00:21:31,155 --> 00:21:35,116
- Well, l live downtown.
- Yeah, we both live downtown.

328
00:21:36,037 --> 00:21:40,678
- lt depends on what way you wanna go.
- l know. lf we took Fifth,

329
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:43,999
- then we'd get to your house first.
- We could do that.

330
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,921
- Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
- Well, sometimes.

331
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,242
- You live in Chelsea, don't you?
- Yeah.

332
00:21:51,362 --> 00:21:54,403
Well, l guess if you live in Chelsea,
that's probably first.

333
00:21:54,524 --> 00:21:56,724
- Oh. OK.
- And then April.

334
00:21:56,845 --> 00:21:58,405
Right.

335
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:09,169
Naturally, l get taken home first.
Obviously he prefers April.

336
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,730
Ofcourse, l was so tongue-tied all night.

337
00:22:11,851 --> 00:22:14,492
l can't believe l said that
about the Guggenheim!

338
00:22:14,612 --> 00:22:18,533
My stupid little roller-skatingjoke.
l should never telljokes.

339
00:22:18,653 --> 00:22:22,014
Mom can tell 'em, and Hannah,
but l kill 'em.

340
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:27,336
Where didApril come up with that stuff
about Adolph Loos and ''organic form''?

341
00:22:27,457 --> 00:22:30,738
Well, naturally, she went to Brandeis.

342
00:22:31,098 --> 00:22:33,618
But l don't think she knows
what she's talking about.

343
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:36,260
Could you believe the way
she was calling him ''David''?

344
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:41,061
''Yes, David. '' ''l feel that way too, David. ''
''What a marvellous space, David. ''

345
00:22:41,182 --> 00:22:43,703
l hate April. She's pushy.

346
00:22:44,183 --> 00:22:47,985
Now they'll dump me and
she'll invite him up. l blew it.

347
00:22:49,025 --> 00:22:51,185
And l really like him a lot.

348
00:22:51,986 --> 00:22:55,347
Oh, screw it. l'm not gonna get
all upset. l've got reading to do.

349
00:22:55,468 --> 00:23:00,389
Maybe l'll get into bed early, turn on
a movie and take an extra Seconal.

350
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,541
- Oh, my goodness!
- Oh, Elliot! What are you doing here?

351
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:26,783
- l'm looking for a book store.
- ln this section of town?

352
00:24:26,903 --> 00:24:30,783
Well, yes. l'm killing time. l have
a client near here and l'm quite early.

353
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:32,424
- How about you?
- Well, l...

354
00:24:32,546 --> 00:24:35,466
Oh, yes! You live near here, don't you?

355
00:24:35,586 --> 00:24:38,627
- Where are you headed?
- l was just going to my AA meeting.

356
00:24:38,747 --> 00:24:41,708
Why do you still go to those?
You never touch alcohol.

357
00:24:41,829 --> 00:24:47,030
You didn't know me before Frederick. l'd
start with a beer about ten in the morning.

358
00:24:47,151 --> 00:24:51,152
- You must have been very unhappy.
- Yeah, unhappy and fat.

359
00:24:51,273 --> 00:24:53,993
And l still find the meetings
very comforting.

360
00:24:54,113 --> 00:24:58,354
l'll never understand it. You're so
bright and charming and beautiful...

361
00:24:58,476 --> 00:25:01,556
l think to myself ''What problems
could she possibly have?''

362
00:25:01,676 --> 00:25:04,477
Don't let me get started on my childhood.

363
00:25:04,598 --> 00:25:08,119
Oh, you know what? There is a book store
a couple of blocks from here.

364
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:11,160
lf you don't know about it,
you should. You'd love it.

365
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,241
Well, if you have some free time...?

366
00:25:13,361 --> 00:25:15,322
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

367
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:19,564
lsn't this great?
They have everything here.

368
00:25:19,724 --> 00:25:22,044
- Yes, it's wonderful.
- What book did you want?

369
00:25:22,205 --> 00:25:24,085
- What?
- You wanted to buy a book.

370
00:25:24,246 --> 00:25:27,606
No, l'm killing time. l just want to browse.

371
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:30,688
You've picked the right place.
You can stay all afternoon,

372
00:25:30,848 --> 00:25:32,448
not buy anything and just read.

373
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:36,050
Unless, if you have some time,
we could get some coffee.

374
00:25:36,211 --> 00:25:39,171
- No, l don't have time.
- No, l understand completely.

375
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:41,731
No problem. You're busy. l...

376
00:25:41,852 --> 00:25:44,573
- You seem tense. ls everything OK?
- No, no.

377
00:25:44,694 --> 00:25:46,414
- No?
- Uh, yes.

378
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:49,175
- Everything's OK?
- Yeah. How are you?

379
00:25:49,295 --> 00:25:51,095
l'm... all right.

380
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,416
- How's Frederick?
- Fine.

381
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:56,338
We went to the Caravaggio
exhibition at the Met.

382
00:25:56,458 --> 00:26:01,060
lt's such a treat to go through a museum
with Frederick. You learn so much.

383
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:05,021
- Do you like Caravaggio?
- Oh, yes. Who doesn't?

384
00:26:05,142 --> 00:26:06,702
Look.

385
00:26:07,903 --> 00:26:11,023
ee cummings. l'd like to get you this.

386
00:26:11,144 --> 00:26:15,825
- Oh, no. l can't let you get me that.
- Yes, l'd like to, very much.

387
00:26:15,946 --> 00:26:19,027
l read a poem of you
and thought of his last week...

388
00:26:19,147 --> 00:26:21,908
a poem of his and thought of you!

389
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:25,109
- You'll be fine, though.
- This is great.

390
00:26:25,229 --> 00:26:28,950
- l love ee cummings, but...
- Listen. l'd love to get you this.

391
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,831
- Are you sure?
- Maybe we could discuss it sometime.

392
00:26:37,634 --> 00:26:41,274
- Well, thanks a lot.
- Thanks for showing me the book store.

393
00:26:41,396 --> 00:26:44,476
Perhaps you could take me
to an AA meeting sometime.

394
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:46,958
- l'd love to see what goes on.
- Yeah, you'd love it.

395
00:26:47,078 --> 00:26:50,239
lt's really entertaining.
l know you'd have a good time.

396
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,680
And don't forget the poem on page 1 1 2.

397
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,161
- lt reminded me of you.
- Really?

398
00:27:00,443 --> 00:27:02,563
Page 1 1 2.

399
00:27:02,683 --> 00:27:04,444
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

400
00:27:11,487 --> 00:27:15,088
Your slightest look
easily will unclose me

401
00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:17,689
though i have closed myself as fingers,

402
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,211
you open always petal by petal
myself as Spring opens

403
00:27:22,331 --> 00:27:26,452
touching skilfully,
mysteriously, her first rose...

404
00:27:28,294 --> 00:27:30,655
I do not know what it is
about you that closes

405
00:27:30,814 --> 00:27:35,055
and opens; only something
in me understands

406
00:27:35,216 --> 00:27:38,937
the voice of your eyes
is deeper than all roses.

407
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:45,260
Nobody, not even the rain,
has such small hands.

408
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:44,003
l wasn't too happy with the results
of your ENG or your BSER, either,

409
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:48,884
which is why l sent you to Tomography,
where you saw that stuff rolling around.

410
00:28:49,006 --> 00:28:51,486
You see this little grey area here?

411
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:55,168
That grey area's what l had hoped
that we wouldn't run into.

412
00:28:55,528 --> 00:28:59,089
l'd like you to come in Monday morning
for a CAT scan.

413
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:03,651
- A brain scan?
- Mr Sachs, let's take it one step at a time.

414
00:29:03,771 --> 00:29:08,773
We won't make any decisions until we
have all the information in front of us.

415
00:29:11,534 --> 00:29:14,175
OK, take it easy.

416
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:16,735
He didn't say you had anything.

417
00:29:16,896 --> 00:29:20,337
Hejust doesn't like the spot
on yourX-ray, that's all.

418
00:29:20,457 --> 00:29:24,578
lt doesn't mean you have anything.
Don'tjump to conclusions.

419
00:29:24,739 --> 00:29:26,460
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

420
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,300
You're in the middle ofNew York City.
This is your town.

421
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:32,902
You're surrounded by people
and traffic and restaurants. God...

422
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:36,103
How can youjust one day vanish?

423
00:29:37,464 --> 00:29:40,585
Keep calm. You're gonna be OK.

424
00:29:40,706 --> 00:29:42,546
Don't panic.

425
00:29:43,187 --> 00:29:45,267
l'm dying! l'm dying!

426
00:29:45,387 --> 00:29:47,987
l know it! There's a spot on my lungs!

427
00:29:48,108 --> 00:29:52,069
All right, now take it easy.
lt's not on your lungs, it's on your ear.

428
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,112
lt's the same thing, isn't it?
Jesus, l can't sleep!

429
00:29:56,232 --> 00:29:59,712
God, there's a tumour in my head
the size ofa basketball!

430
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:02,753
Now l keep thinking
l can feel it every time l blink!

431
00:30:02,874 --> 00:30:06,315
Oh, Jesus!
He wants me to do a brain scan

432
00:30:06,435 --> 00:30:08,916
to confirm what he already suspects.

433
00:30:09,036 --> 00:30:11,037
Look, l'll make a deal with God.

434
00:30:11,157 --> 00:30:14,758
Let itjust be my ear, OK?
l'll go deaf, and blind in one eye, maybe.

435
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,640
But l don't want a brain operation.
Once they go into my skull,

436
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,920
l'll wind up like the guy with the wool cap
who delivers for the florist.

437
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:26,643
Relax, will ya? Your whole life, you run
to doctors, the news is always fine.

438
00:30:26,763 --> 00:30:29,764
No, that's not true. What about years ago?

439
00:30:30,044 --> 00:30:33,205
l'm sorry to say, Mr Sachs,
that you cannot have children.

440
00:30:35,526 --> 00:30:37,206
Gee.

441
00:30:37,327 --> 00:30:39,048
ls there no chance?

442
00:30:39,168 --> 00:30:42,128
This doesn't mean that
you can't have a normal sex life,

443
00:30:42,249 --> 00:30:45,170
but Mr Sachs' tests indicate
that he is infertile.

444
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:47,890
Small sperm volume and infertile.

445
00:30:48,011 --> 00:30:50,292
ls there anything l can do?
Push-ups? Hormones?

446
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:53,054
- l'm afraid not.
- l gotta get a second opinion.

447
00:30:53,174 --> 00:30:55,774
- This is the second opinion.
- Well, a third opinion.

448
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,895
l realise this is a blow.

449
00:30:58,015 --> 00:31:02,176
My experience is that many very fine
marriages become unstable

450
00:31:02,297 --> 00:31:06,578
and are destroyed by an inability
to deal with this sort of problem.

451
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:08,979
l hope you won't make too much of it.

452
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:14,021
One can adopt children, and there are
various artificial methods of fertilisation.

453
00:31:14,502 --> 00:31:17,943
- l'm so humiliated.
- Could you have ruined yourself?

454
00:31:18,103 --> 00:31:21,704
- How could l ruin myself?
- l don't know. Excessive masturbation?

455
00:31:21,825 --> 00:31:24,625
Hey, you gonna start
knockin' my hobbies? Jesus!

456
00:31:24,746 --> 00:31:28,867
- Maybe we can adopt a child.
- What about artificial insemination?

457
00:31:29,027 --> 00:31:31,668
- What are you talkin' about?
- l would get implanted.

458
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:35,710
- By a stranger?
- They have banks where they're frozen.

459
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,271
- You want a defrosted kid?
- l want to experience childbirth.

460
00:31:39,432 --> 00:31:43,152
- With a stranger?
- Just think about it, that's all l ask.

461
00:31:43,313 --> 00:31:46,835
Oh, that was a wonderful show.
That's the best show you two ever wrote.

462
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:51,076
The funniest show that Mickey and l ever
did was the one we won the Emmy for.

463
00:31:51,196 --> 00:31:56,278
l think as far as plain laughs go, that was
probably the best thing that we ever did.

464
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:00,879
Yeah, it was funny, but the show about
the two Frenchmen was funny and warm.

465
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,682
- We got that idea on that trip to Paris.
- Remember that summer in France?

466
00:32:04,802 --> 00:32:06,922
Hannah, you had jet lag for six weeks.

467
00:32:07,042 --> 00:32:10,683
Yeah, but it was... l guess
we had fun when we were there.

468
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,844
Sorry. Coffee?

469
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:15,485
Listen, you guys... Want some more?

470
00:32:15,606 --> 00:32:19,287
We had something
we really wanted to discuss with you.

471
00:32:19,407 --> 00:32:23,368
Yeah. Jesus, this is very delicate.

472
00:32:23,488 --> 00:32:26,649
And l only bring this up amongst friends.

473
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:31,611
This should not go
any further than this room.

474
00:32:31,732 --> 00:32:33,693
l'm all ears.

475
00:32:35,213 --> 00:32:38,214
Hannah and l can't have any children.

476
00:32:38,334 --> 00:32:43,336
Now, l don't wanna get into whose
fault it is. lt's my fault that we can't.

477
00:32:43,457 --> 00:32:45,537
The details are too embarrassing to...

478
00:32:45,657 --> 00:32:51,139
We've decided, after a lot of discussion,
that we'd try with artificial insemination.

479
00:32:51,259 --> 00:32:53,740
Yeah, l'm not so sure
that l like that idea myself.

480
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:59,061
And l didn't want to go to a sperm bank
and have some anonymous donor.

481
00:32:59,182 --> 00:33:00,982
l just wouldn't want that.

482
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:04,984
We felt, if we were gonna do it, we'd like
somebody who we knew and liked,

483
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:07,545
and was warm and bright...

484
00:33:07,666 --> 00:33:09,986
You can say no.
Feel free to say no.

485
00:33:10,107 --> 00:33:12,547
We realise it has all kinds of implications.

486
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:17,149
The point that we're making here
is that we need some sperm.

487
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,390
Gee.

488
00:33:21,551 --> 00:33:27,633
Well, my first reaction, after the initial
shock, is flattered that you'd ask me.

489
00:33:27,794 --> 00:33:31,434
l would be the father. You would
just have to masturbate into a little cup.

490
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:36,157
- l can handle that.
- Obviously we wouldn't have intercourse.

491
00:33:36,317 --> 00:33:40,077
Gosh, listen. l've gotta tell you the truth.
l'm a little uneasy about this.

492
00:33:40,238 --> 00:33:44,919
- l know it's a lot to ask.
- Well, l feel for you, l do. l...

493
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:48,602
l'm gonna cry. You want
my husband to have a child with you?

494
00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:53,684
Don't answer now. Just take it home
and think about it for a while.

495
00:33:54,524 --> 00:33:58,966
l gave blood before...
and clothing to the poor.

496
00:33:59,086 --> 00:34:02,087
OK, Norman, listen.
l really wanna talk about this at home.

497
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,688
l think it's a matter for
your analyst, and mine.

498
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:07,369
And maybe my lawyer.

499
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:12,170
We understand completely
if you feel you'd rather not.

500
00:34:13,492 --> 00:34:18,253
l didn't mean to spoil the evening.
Let's move on to another topic.

501
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:22,134
So you had my ex-partner's baby. Twins.

502
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:26,697
And maybe that did cause some trouble,
but l think we were drifting apart anyhow.

503
00:34:26,817 --> 00:34:29,818
Now, instead ofman and wife,
we'rejust good friends.

504
00:34:29,938 --> 00:34:33,339
Boy, love is really unpredictable.

505
00:34:33,459 --> 00:34:35,820
(aria from ''Manon Lescaut'')

506
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:27,119
Lee? Frederick?
Say hello to Dusty Frye.

507
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,680
- Hi, Dusty.
- Hi.

508
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:32,602
Dusty's just bought a huge house in
Southampton and he's decorating it.

509
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:37,123
Yeah, it's kind of a weird place.
A lot of wall space. How you doin', man?

510
00:35:37,284 --> 00:35:40,004
l told him about your work
and he's very excited.

511
00:35:40,165 --> 00:35:42,885
l got an Andy Warhol,
and l got a Frank Stella too.

512
00:35:43,046 --> 00:35:46,487
lt's very beautiful. Big, weird, you know?

513
00:35:46,648 --> 00:35:50,769
lf you stare at that Stella too long,
the colours just seem to float. lt's weird.

514
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,170
Are you excited about
becoming a collector?

515
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:57,612
Yeah. l got a lot more to learn, though.
l really wasn't into art when l was a kid.

516
00:35:57,732 --> 00:36:00,133
Do you appreciate drawings?

517
00:36:00,253 --> 00:36:01,493
Yeah.

518
00:36:01,614 --> 00:36:04,775
Oh, hey, wow. She's beautiful.

519
00:36:06,375 --> 00:36:10,616
But really l need somethin'...
l'm lookin' for somethin' big.

520
00:36:10,737 --> 00:36:13,498
- Frederick, show him the oils.
- They're in the basement.

521
00:36:13,618 --> 00:36:16,499
Frederick's done a new series
that l'm sure you'd love.

522
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:19,260
- Are they big?
- Yeah, some of them are.

523
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,341
Cos l got a lot of wall space there.

524
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:24,622
l don't sell my work by the yard.

525
00:36:24,742 --> 00:36:26,343
Oh, Frederick!

526
00:36:31,745 --> 00:36:34,185
- How's everything?
- Oh, you know.

527
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:36,947
l talked to Hannah this morning.

528
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:39,548
She said you were going to
the country this weekend.

529
00:36:39,668 --> 00:36:41,829
Yes, she loves to go out in the woods.

530
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,909
But l go nuts. lt's a conflict.

531
00:36:47,192 --> 00:36:51,153
- l have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
- Oh, that's nice.

532
00:36:53,194 --> 00:36:55,675
l figured l'd get
Frederick and Dusty together.

533
00:36:55,795 --> 00:36:59,516
- Yeah, that's really nice of you.
- This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.

534
00:36:59,636 --> 00:37:03,877
- He's got six gold records.
- Oh, speaking of records,

535
00:37:03,998 --> 00:37:06,119
l bought that Mozart trio
you recommended.

536
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,839
The man in the shop showed me
another one you'd love.

537
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,241
lt's another Bach, second movement.

538
00:37:12,361 --> 00:37:15,642
You have that one? l'd love to hear it.

539
00:37:15,762 --> 00:37:20,204
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man
who loves opera, an architect.

540
00:37:20,324 --> 00:37:23,925
Well, that's nice.
l'd love to see her wind up settled.

541
00:37:24,086 --> 00:37:26,046
She's a tense one.

542
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,890
lsn't that beautiful?

543
00:37:37,011 --> 00:37:38,651
l know this.

544
00:37:38,811 --> 00:37:42,532
Bach, F Minor Concerto.
lt's one of my favourites.

545
00:37:45,814 --> 00:37:47,695
Uh...

546
00:37:47,855 --> 00:37:50,856
Did you ever get around to ee cummings?

547
00:37:51,017 --> 00:37:53,137
Yes, he's just adorable.

548
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:58,659
They have a very large gay clientele
where l get my teeth cleaned.

549
00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:02,460
All the hygienists now wear gloves
because they're afraid of AlDS.

550
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,541
Oh, right.

551
00:38:07,063 --> 00:38:10,503
Did you ever get around
to the poem on page 1 1 2?

552
00:38:11,585 --> 00:38:15,546
Yes, it made me cry,
it was so beautiful, so romantic.

553
00:38:17,347 --> 00:38:19,627
l want so badly to kiss her.

554
00:38:19,747 --> 00:38:23,188
Not here, you idiot.
You've got to get her alone someplace.

555
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:28,311
But l've got to proceed cautiously.
This is a very delicate situation.

556
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,031
OK, uh...

557
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:33,392
Ask her ifyou can see her for lunch,
or a drink tomorrow.

558
00:38:33,513 --> 00:38:37,114
And be ready to make light
ofthe offer ifshe's unresponsive.

559
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:41,635
This has to be done very skilfully
and very diplomatically.

560
00:38:41,756 --> 00:38:43,716
Did you ever read this one...?

561
00:38:45,277 --> 00:38:48,038
- Elliot, don't!
- Lee, l'm in love with you!

562
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:51,319
What are you doing?

563
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,560
l'm sorry. l have to talk to you.
There's so much l want to say.

564
00:38:54,681 --> 00:38:58,082
l've been in love with you for so long...

565
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,364
Forget it! l'm not interested in selling it.

566
00:39:01,484 --> 00:39:04,645
l only asked if you had
something with a little puce in it!

567
00:39:04,765 --> 00:39:05,605
What's wrong?

568
00:39:05,725 --> 00:39:08,086
l don't care about your interior decorator!

569
00:39:08,206 --> 00:39:12,407
l can't commit to anything without
consulting her first. That's why l have her.

570
00:39:12,527 --> 00:39:16,569
This is degrading! You don't buy paintings
to blend in with the sofa!

571
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:19,650
lt's not a sofa. lt's an ottoman!

572
00:39:19,771 --> 00:39:23,251
God, forget it.
Let's just get outta here, Elliot.

573
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:26,894
What a weirdo that guy is. Paranoid...

574
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:30,974
- What's the matter with you?
- l'll be OK.

575
00:39:31,095 --> 00:39:34,536
- lt's no big deal. We just didn't hit it off.
- No, you go on ahead.

576
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:37,937
- Are you OK? You're sweating.
- Yeah, l just need some fresh air.

577
00:39:38,057 --> 00:39:42,178
lt's probably something l ate.
l'll walk, you go ahead. Go on.

578
00:39:58,426 --> 00:40:00,387
Hello.

579
00:40:01,187 --> 00:40:02,547
Hello?

580
00:40:03,307 --> 00:40:05,068
Hello!

581
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:14,752
Oh, there you are! l was looking for you.

582
00:40:14,872 --> 00:40:17,633
l must apologise.
l'm sorry. l'm so mixed up!

583
00:40:17,753 --> 00:40:19,714
How do you expect me to react?

584
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,315
l know, but l am in love with you.

585
00:40:22,435 --> 00:40:25,836
- Oh, don't say those words!
- l'm sorry. l know, it's terrible.

586
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,637
- You know the situation.
- l know. l realise.

587
00:40:28,758 --> 00:40:32,599
- What do you expect me to say?
- Hannah and l are in the last stages.

588
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:35,600
She's never said so, and
we're very close. She'd tell me.

589
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,880
lt's so sad. She's crazy about me,

590
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:41,082
but somewhere along the line,
l've fallen out of love with her.

591
00:40:41,202 --> 00:40:44,643
- Not because of me, l hope?
- Oh, no, no... Well, yes! l love you.

592
00:40:44,764 --> 00:40:49,326
- l can't be the cause of anything...
- No, it was inevitable that we part.

593
00:40:49,445 --> 00:40:51,566
- Why?
- For a million reasons.

594
00:40:51,687 --> 00:40:55,528
- But not over me?
- No, we're going in different directions.

595
00:40:55,648 --> 00:40:57,568
- Poor Hannah.
- But how about you?

596
00:40:57,689 --> 00:41:01,290
Do you share any of my feelings, or
is this an unpleasant embarrassment?

597
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:05,531
- l can't say anything.
- Be candid. l don't want you to feel bad.

598
00:41:05,652 --> 00:41:09,293
Yes, l have certain feelings for you,
but don't make me say anything more.

599
00:41:09,414 --> 00:41:14,055
OK, OK, you've said enough. lt's my
responsibility now. l'll work things out.

600
00:41:14,175 --> 00:41:17,896
Don't do anything for me. l live with
Frederick, and Hannah and l are close.

601
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:22,538
- Yes, but you do care about me?
- Elliot, please, l can't be a party to this.

602
00:41:22,658 --> 00:41:25,459
l'm suddenly wracked with guilt
just talking to you.

603
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,260
Your guilt is because you feel the same.

604
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:31,661
Oh, please, l have to go.
l have to get my teeth cleaned.

605
00:41:32,502 --> 00:41:35,623
l have my answer. l have my answer.

606
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:38,585
l'm walking on air!

607
00:41:55,271 --> 00:41:57,432
- God, am l glad to see you!
- Hi. How's she doing?

608
00:41:57,552 --> 00:42:00,672
She's in the kitchen there.
lt's the same thing.

609
00:42:00,793 --> 00:42:03,674
She promises, promises.
And it's all lies, always.

610
00:42:03,794 --> 00:42:05,515
Don't make it worse, Dad.

611
00:42:05,635 --> 00:42:07,515
Hi, Mom. How are you doing?

612
00:42:07,636 --> 00:42:10,917
l'll get you some coffee.
That's enough of that. What triggered it?

613
00:42:11,038 --> 00:42:13,318
We were making a commercial
at the mayor's office.

614
00:42:13,438 --> 00:42:15,399
There was this young salesman

615
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:20,040
and your mother was throwing
herself at him in a disgusting way.

616
00:42:20,161 --> 00:42:25,042
Then she found she was too old to seduce
him, that he was just embarrassed by her.

617
00:42:25,163 --> 00:42:26,322
Liar! Liar!

618
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:31,565
At lunch, she got drunker and drunker,
and finally she became Joan Collins.

619
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:35,926
All my life l've had to put up
with insults from this non-person!

620
00:42:36,047 --> 00:42:39,528
This haircut that passes for a man!

621
00:42:39,648 --> 00:42:43,929
He could never support us. lt's
a good thing we had a talented daughter.

622
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,650
l can only hope that she was mine!

623
00:42:46,771 --> 00:42:50,452
With you as her mother, her father
could be anybody in Actors' Equity!

624
00:42:50,572 --> 00:42:53,133
She's talented,
so it's unlikely she's yours.

625
00:42:53,254 --> 00:42:56,655
Dad, could you stay in the other room
and let me take care of her?

626
00:42:56,775 --> 00:43:01,777
You never know when she's gonna fall off
the wagon and humiliate everybody.

627
00:43:01,897 --> 00:43:04,177
Here, Mom. Drink this.

628
00:43:04,298 --> 00:43:07,459
You know, you're awful.
You probably were flirting.

629
00:43:07,579 --> 00:43:10,780
No! l like to joke around and have fun

630
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:13,620
and he gets angry
because l get the attention.

631
00:43:13,742 --> 00:43:18,463
He's gotten sourer as he's gotten older
and l've tried to stay young... at heart.

632
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:20,464
You promised to stay on the wagon.

633
00:43:20,585 --> 00:43:23,025
The sacrifices l've made
because of that man...

634
00:43:23,145 --> 00:43:28,147
He's ruined me with his ego,
his philandering, his... mediocrity!

635
00:43:28,307 --> 00:43:30,308
OK, stop being so dramatic.

636
00:43:30,428 --> 00:43:32,789
He's the one that's laid
every ingenue in stock!

637
00:43:32,909 --> 00:43:34,789
OK, OK.

638
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,071
- They wanted me for a screen test.
- l know.

639
00:43:37,231 --> 00:43:40,032
But l knew that he'd get up there
and flounder around

640
00:43:40,152 --> 00:43:44,353
with his expensive haircuts
and hairdos and clothes.

641
00:43:44,513 --> 00:43:46,394
He's all show.

642
00:43:46,554 --> 00:43:51,476
Now, how can you act when
there's nothing inside to come out?

643
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,082
She was so beautiful at
one time, and he was so dashing,

644
00:44:06,202 --> 00:44:11,204
both ofthemjust full ofpromise
and hopes that never materialised.

645
00:44:12,045 --> 00:44:16,566
Then the fights and the constant
infidelities to prove themselves

646
00:44:16,686 --> 00:44:19,447
and blaming each other. lt's sad.

647
00:44:20,207 --> 00:44:24,848
They loved the idea ofhaving us kids,
but raising us didn't interest them much.

648
00:44:24,969 --> 00:44:29,971
But it's impossible to hold it against
them. They didn't know anything else.

649
00:44:30,692 --> 00:44:36,013
You know, of all of us in the family, you
were the one blessed with the true gift.

650
00:44:36,134 --> 00:44:41,376
My true gift is luck, Mom. l just had
a lot of luck, from my first show.

651
00:44:41,496 --> 00:44:44,017
l thought Lee was the one
destined for great things.

652
00:44:44,137 --> 00:44:48,898
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't
have your spark. She knows it.

653
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:52,380
She worships you.
She wouldn't dare get up there on stage.

654
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:56,861
- Now, Holly's not shy.
- Holly's game for anything.

655
00:44:56,982 --> 00:44:58,782
- Holly takes after me.
- True.

656
00:44:58,903 --> 00:45:01,343
l'd have been a great dope addict.

657
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:04,705
Remember this, Hannah?

658
00:46:24,976 --> 00:46:27,936
Mr Sachs, l'm afraid the news is not good.

659
00:46:30,178 --> 00:46:32,819
lf l can show you exactly
where the tumour is,

660
00:46:32,939 --> 00:46:36,660
and why we feel that
surgery would be of no use...

661
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:40,902
lt's over.

662
00:46:41,023 --> 00:46:43,384
l'm face to face with eternity.

663
00:46:44,344 --> 00:46:46,304
Not later, but now.

664
00:46:47,345 --> 00:46:51,506
l'm so frightened,
l can't move, speak or breathe.

665
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:57,669
Well, you're just fine.
There's absolutely nothing here at all.

666
00:46:57,789 --> 00:46:59,949
And your tests are all fine.

667
00:47:01,150 --> 00:47:05,031
l must admit, l was concerned,
given your symptoms.

668
00:47:05,152 --> 00:47:07,992
What caused this hearing loss,
we'll never know for sure,

669
00:47:08,113 --> 00:47:13,034
but whatever it was, it's certainly not
anything serious. l'm very relieved.

670
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:32,722
What do you mean, you're quitting? Why?

671
00:47:32,842 --> 00:47:36,884
The news is good.
You don't have canc... the thing.

672
00:47:37,004 --> 00:47:40,124
Do you realise what a thread
we're all hanging by?

673
00:47:40,245 --> 00:47:42,806
You're off the hook.
You should be celebrating.

674
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:45,607
Can you understand how
meaningless everything is?

675
00:47:45,727 --> 00:47:49,529
l'm talking about our lives, the show,
the whole world. lt's meaningless.

676
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:53,651
- Yeah, but you're not dying.
- No, l'm not dying now, but...

677
00:47:53,771 --> 00:47:57,411
When l ran out of the hospital, l was so
thrilled because l was going to be OK.

678
00:47:57,572 --> 00:48:00,573
l'm running down the street,
and suddenly l stop. lt hit me.

679
00:48:00,733 --> 00:48:04,134
So l'm not gonna go today,
l'm not gonna go tomorrow,

680
00:48:04,295 --> 00:48:06,696
but eventually
l'm gonna be in that position.

681
00:48:06,816 --> 00:48:10,897
- You're just realising this now?
- No, l've known it all the time.

682
00:48:11,017 --> 00:48:13,258
But l stuck it in the back of my mind

683
00:48:13,379 --> 00:48:17,019
because it's a very
horrible thing to think about.

684
00:48:17,139 --> 00:48:19,500
- Can l tell you something? A secret?
- Yeah, sure.

685
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:23,142
A week ago, l bought a rifle.
l went into a store and bought one.

686
00:48:23,262 --> 00:48:25,262
lf l had a tumour, l was gonna kill myself.

687
00:48:25,383 --> 00:48:28,944
The only thing that might've stopped me
is my parents would be devastated.

688
00:48:29,065 --> 00:48:31,025
l would have had to shoot them first.

689
00:48:31,145 --> 00:48:34,306
And then my aunt and uncle.
lt would have been a bloodbath.

690
00:48:34,426 --> 00:48:38,628
Well, you know, eventually
it is going to happen to all of us.

691
00:48:38,748 --> 00:48:43,669
But doesn't that ruin everything for you?
lt takes the pleasure out of everything.

692
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:47,471
You're gonna die, l'm gonna die, the
audience, the network, the sponsor...

693
00:48:47,592 --> 00:48:49,912
- l know, and your hamster.
- Yes!

694
00:48:50,033 --> 00:48:53,273
Listen, kid. l think you snapped your cap.

695
00:48:53,394 --> 00:48:57,476
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda
or something, or go to a whorehouse.

696
00:48:57,596 --> 00:48:59,676
l can't stay on this show. l need answers.

697
00:48:59,797 --> 00:49:03,557
Otherwise, l'm telling you,
l'm gonna do something drastic.

698
00:49:21,845 --> 00:49:25,205
- l thought you weren't coming.
- l almost didn't.

699
00:49:26,207 --> 00:49:29,168
- l didn't sleep all night.
- No, l'm sure.

700
00:49:30,408 --> 00:49:33,569
What are we doing, meeting
in a hotel room? lt's terrible.

701
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:36,450
l couldn't think where to invite you
without taking risks.

702
00:49:36,571 --> 00:49:40,252
l promised myself l wouldn't let this
happen till you were living alone.

703
00:49:40,372 --> 00:49:42,212
l was so torn when you called.

704
00:49:42,333 --> 00:49:46,454
l've wanted to call you every day
since l first told you how l felt.

705
00:49:46,614 --> 00:49:48,735
l resisted so many times.

706
00:49:51,456 --> 00:49:53,417
Don't think badly of me.

707
00:49:56,018 --> 00:49:57,979
This is not an easy situation.

708
00:49:58,139 --> 00:50:00,059
l know it isn't.

709
00:50:16,386 --> 00:50:18,347
That was just perfect.

710
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:21,748
You've ruined me for anyone else.

711
00:50:21,868 --> 00:50:24,829
l don't want anyone else ever to have you.

712
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:28,391
l was so worried
l wouldn't compare with Hannah.

713
00:50:28,511 --> 00:50:32,392
Oh, my God. You really do have
those thoughts, don't you?

714
00:50:32,513 --> 00:50:34,474
All the time.

715
00:50:34,594 --> 00:50:36,874
l know she must be
a really passionate person.

716
00:50:36,994 --> 00:50:42,156
Yes, she's very warm and giving,
but it's me that wants to be giving to you.

717
00:50:42,277 --> 00:50:47,118
l wanna do things for you.
Hannah doesn't need me as much.

718
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:51,480
Oh, l'm being presumptuous.
Not that you need me...

719
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,880
l want you to take care of me.

720
00:50:55,241 --> 00:50:58,002
And l love when you do things to me.

721
00:51:26,054 --> 00:51:28,454
- You're late.
- Lucy and l kept talking.

722
00:51:28,574 --> 00:51:31,015
l didn't realise how late it had got.

723
00:51:31,896 --> 00:51:35,818
You missed a very dull
TV show about Auschwitz.

724
00:51:35,938 --> 00:51:40,019
More gruesome film clips,
and more puzzled intellectuals

725
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:44,340
declaring their mystification over
the systematic murder of millions.

726
00:51:44,461 --> 00:51:48,422
The reason why they can never answer
the question ''How could it happen?''

727
00:51:48,542 --> 00:51:50,342
is that it's the wrong question.

728
00:51:50,503 --> 00:51:54,263
Given what people are, the question is
''Why doesn't it happen more often?''

729
00:51:54,384 --> 00:51:59,506
- Of course, it does, in subtler forms.
- l have a headache from this weather.

730
00:52:02,668 --> 00:52:05,709
lt's been ages since
l sat in front of the TV,

731
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:08,509
just changing channels to find something.

732
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,870
You see the whole culture:

733
00:52:11,031 --> 00:52:13,151
Nazis, deodorant salesmen,

734
00:52:14,032 --> 00:52:17,193
wrestlers, beauty contests,
the talk show...

735
00:52:17,993 --> 00:52:21,754
Can you imagine the level of
a mind that watches wrestling?

736
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:26,717
But the worst are the fundamentalist
preachers: third-rate con men

737
00:52:26,837 --> 00:52:30,278
telling the poor suckers that watch them
that they speak for Jesus.

738
00:52:30,399 --> 00:52:33,759
And to please send in money.
Money, money, money.

739
00:52:33,879 --> 00:52:38,081
lf Jesus came back and saw
what's going on in his name,

740
00:52:38,202 --> 00:52:42,163
- he'd never stop throwing up.
- Oh, God, would you please lighten up?

741
00:52:42,283 --> 00:52:46,644
l'm really not in the mood to hear
a review of contemporary society again.

742
00:52:47,765 --> 00:52:51,287
- You've been very nervous lately.
- l can't take this any more.

743
00:52:51,407 --> 00:52:54,327
l'm trying to complete an education
l started five years ago.

744
00:52:54,447 --> 00:52:56,928
l'm not your pupil. l was, but l'm not.

745
00:52:57,049 --> 00:53:00,369
When you leave the nest, l want you
to be ready to face the real world.

746
00:53:00,490 --> 00:53:02,611
We're going to have to
make some changes.

747
00:53:02,731 --> 00:53:05,692
- Like what?
- You know what. l'm suffocating.

748
00:53:05,813 --> 00:53:10,334
- Are we having this conversation again?
- Yes, we are having it again.

749
00:53:10,454 --> 00:53:13,495
- l have to leave. l have to move out.
- Why?

750
00:53:13,615 --> 00:53:16,815
- Because l have to.
- What are you going to use for money?

751
00:53:16,937 --> 00:53:20,338
l don't know. l thought maybe l'd
move in with my parents for a while.

752
00:53:20,458 --> 00:53:25,020
l always told you you would leave me.
Does it have to be now?

753
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,340
Maybe it'll only be temporary,
but l have to try.

754
00:53:28,461 --> 00:53:31,421
Oh, Lee. You are my whole world.

755
00:53:35,024 --> 00:53:38,425
Good God. Have you been kissed tonight?

756
00:53:38,545 --> 00:53:40,826
- No.
- Oh, yes, you have.

757
00:53:40,946 --> 00:53:43,386
- You've been with someone!
- Stop accusing me!

758
00:53:43,507 --> 00:53:45,587
l'm too smart, Lee. You can't fool me!

759
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:47,669
- You're turning all red.
- Leave me alone!

760
00:53:47,828 --> 00:53:50,189
Christ, what's wrong with you?

761
00:53:52,751 --> 00:53:55,511
- l'm sorry.
- Couldn't you say something?

762
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:59,073
- You have to slither behind my back...
- l'm saying it now!

763
00:53:59,233 --> 00:54:01,194
So you met somebody else?

764
00:54:02,154 --> 00:54:03,074
Yeah.

765
00:54:03,234 --> 00:54:07,276
But you knew it was going to happen
sooner or later. l can't live like this!

766
00:54:07,396 --> 00:54:10,516
- Who is it?
- What's the difference? Somebody l met.

767
00:54:10,677 --> 00:54:14,718
- But who? Where did you meet him?
- lt doesn't matter. l have to move out.

768
00:54:14,879 --> 00:54:17,199
You are my only connection to the world.

769
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:21,200
Oh, God, that's too much
responsibility for me. lt's not fair!

770
00:54:21,321 --> 00:54:24,122
l want a less complicated life.
l want a husband,

771
00:54:24,243 --> 00:54:28,285
- maybe even a child, before it's too late.
- Jesus! Jesus!

772
00:54:28,405 --> 00:54:31,166
Oh, God, l don't even know what l want.

773
00:54:34,086 --> 00:54:37,047
What do you get out of me,
anyway? l mean...

774
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:40,608
lt's not sexual any more.

775
00:54:41,649 --> 00:54:45,330
lt's certainly not intellectual.
You're so superior to me in every way...

776
00:54:45,451 --> 00:54:47,411
Don't patronise me!

777
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:54,095
God, l should have married you
years ago, when you wanted to.

778
00:54:54,215 --> 00:54:58,056
- l should have agreed.
- lt never would have worked.

779
00:54:59,817 --> 00:55:03,778
l told you one day you would
leave me for a younger man. l...

780
00:55:14,342 --> 00:55:17,783
What passion today with Lee!
She's a volcano.

781
00:55:18,944 --> 00:55:23,306
lt was a totally fulfilling experience,
just as l'd dreamed it would be.

782
00:55:23,426 --> 00:55:27,827
That's what it was. lt was like
living out a dream. A great dream.

783
00:55:28,868 --> 00:55:32,309
Now l feel very good and cosy
being here next to Hannah.

784
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:35,070
There's something very lovely
and real about Hannah.

785
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:39,591
She gives me a very deep feeling
ofbeing part ofsomething.

786
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:43,593
She's a wonderful woman...
and l betrayed her.

787
00:55:43,714 --> 00:55:46,235
She came into my empty life
and changed it,

788
00:55:46,355 --> 00:55:49,876
and l paid her back by
banging her sister in a hotel room.

789
00:55:50,036 --> 00:55:53,957
God, l'm despicable.
What a cruel and shallow thing to do.

790
00:55:54,077 --> 00:55:56,358
l have to call her and say
what we did was crazy.

791
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:00,560
lt can't happen again. l'm not that kind
ofman, and l value Hannah too much.

792
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,121
l love my wife.
Now l betrayed her. Oh, God!

793
00:56:04,882 --> 00:56:08,283
- Where are you going?
- l've, uh, got to get a phone number.

794
00:56:08,444 --> 00:56:10,724
- l forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
- lt's so late.

795
00:56:10,925 --> 00:56:12,805
Yeah, l can't believe l forgot.

796
00:56:13,926 --> 00:56:16,526
lf he answers, l'll hang up.

797
00:56:16,687 --> 00:56:21,128
l'll tell her we can't communicate until
l terminate my marriage. lt's immoral.

798
00:56:21,248 --> 00:56:25,210
Then time will pass, l won't call,
and she'll get the idea.

799
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:27,890
Gotta stop this before l get in too deep.

800
00:56:28,011 --> 00:56:31,933
l'd rather hurt Lee a little
than destroy Hannah.

801
00:56:32,053 --> 00:56:36,734
lt's 1 .30. She can't have a conversation
with me with him around.

802
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:38,895
l'm getting hysterical.

803
00:56:39,015 --> 00:56:41,256
l'll call her first thing in the morning.

804
00:56:41,376 --> 00:56:42,976
l'll call her at six.

805
00:56:43,097 --> 00:56:47,778
Frederick goes jogging at six.
l'll call her and nip it in the bud.

806
00:56:49,019 --> 00:56:50,980
l've got it! l've got it!

807
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,340
Hello?

808
00:56:53,461 --> 00:56:54,860
Mel!

809
00:56:54,982 --> 00:56:58,263
l would have hung up if you hadn't
answered and l won't do this again,

810
00:56:58,383 --> 00:57:02,184
but l just had to tell you...
l feel very close to you tonight.

811
00:57:02,304 --> 00:57:04,464
Very, very close.

812
00:57:04,586 --> 00:57:06,346
Good night.

813
00:57:19,831 --> 00:57:23,113
Millions ofbooks written
on every conceivable subject

814
00:57:23,233 --> 00:57:27,714
by all these great minds, and in the end
none ofthem knows anything more

815
00:57:27,834 --> 00:57:30,554
about the big questions oflife than l do.

816
00:57:30,675 --> 00:57:33,396
Jesus, l read Socrates.

817
00:57:33,517 --> 00:57:37,718
This guy used to knock offlittle Greek
boys. What the hell's he got to teach me?

818
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:42,079
And Nietzsche, with his
theory ofeternal recurrence.

819
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:45,400
He said that the life we live,
we're gonna live over and over again

820
00:57:45,521 --> 00:57:48,121
the exact same way for eternity.

821
00:57:48,242 --> 00:57:53,604
Great. That means l'll have to sit through
the ''lce Capades'' again. lt's not worth it.

822
00:57:53,724 --> 00:57:56,685
And Freud, another great pessimist.

823
00:57:56,805 --> 00:57:59,925
l was in analysis for years.
Nothing happened.

824
00:58:00,046 --> 00:58:04,967
My poor analyst got so frustrated,
the guy finally put in a salad bar.

825
00:58:05,089 --> 00:58:07,289
Look at all these people jogging,

826
00:58:07,449 --> 00:58:10,490
trying to stave off
the inevitable decay ofthe body.

827
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:13,171
Boy, it's so sad what people go through

828
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:17,253
with their stationary bike
and their exercise.

829
00:58:17,414 --> 00:58:21,735
Look at this one. Poor thing.
She has to tote all that fat around.

830
00:58:21,855 --> 00:58:24,016
She should pull it on a dolly.

831
00:58:24,936 --> 00:58:28,697
Maybe the poets are right.
Maybe love is the only answer.

832
00:58:28,818 --> 00:58:32,018
l was in love with Hannah,
but it didn't work out too well.

833
00:58:32,139 --> 00:58:35,141
l even took her sister out.
Remember that, years ago?

834
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:39,822
When Hannah and l got divorced and
she fixed me up with her sister Holly?

835
00:58:42,743 --> 00:58:46,344
l wanna be like you,
said l'm gonna fit into your group

836
00:58:48,065 --> 00:58:52,066
l don't wanna be different,
said l'm gonna be just like you

837
00:58:53,547 --> 00:58:57,188
Because l'm gonna buy the records
that they play on the radio

838
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:02,872
l'm gonna dance at clubs,
gonna do just what l'm told

839
00:59:04,032 --> 00:59:07,633
And l'm bleedin', you know...

840
00:59:07,753 --> 00:59:11,514
- Why are you makin' those faces?
- l can't hear you. l can't hear anything.

841
00:59:11,635 --> 00:59:15,956
- l'm gonna lose hearing in my ear.
- Listen, you're witnessing genius.

842
00:59:16,076 --> 00:59:19,237
My ears are experiencing a meltdown.
l can't hear anything.

843
00:59:19,357 --> 00:59:21,838
Can't you feel the energy,
the tangible energy?

844
00:59:21,958 --> 00:59:24,359
The room's alive with positive vibrations.

845
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,241
l'm frightened. After they sing,
they're gonna take hostages.

846
00:59:28,361 --> 00:59:30,761
Don't, no, please.

847
00:59:30,882 --> 00:59:34,043
- You want some? Come on!
- No, you've been doing that all night.

848
00:59:34,163 --> 00:59:37,725
You're gonna burn a hole...
You're gonna develop a third nostril.

849
00:59:37,845 --> 00:59:41,126
- Don't, please. Can we go?
- No!

850
00:59:42,406 --> 00:59:46,088
Because l'm gonna buy the records
that they play on the radio...

851
00:59:46,848 --> 00:59:49,968
l love songs about
extraterrestrial life. Don't you?

852
00:59:50,089 --> 00:59:53,850
- Not if they're sung by extraterrestrials.
- l cannot communicate with you!

853
00:59:54,011 --> 00:59:55,972
l never knew you were such a tight-ass.

854
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:59,933
Both your sisters have such good taste
in music. Where did you go wrong?

855
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:01,934
Do you mind? l'm my own person.

856
01:00:02,054 --> 01:00:05,095
- Can l take you to hear something nice?
- lt's getting late.

857
01:00:05,256 --> 01:00:08,216
- Come on, cos you're being angry.
- l'm not angry!

858
01:00:08,377 --> 01:00:11,978
You don't believe in ESP, you don't
like rock music, you won't get high...

859
01:00:12,138 --> 01:00:13,938
lt's like l'm dating Cardinal Cooke!

860
01:00:20,061 --> 01:00:22,621
Why am l

861
01:00:22,703 --> 01:00:25,464
Just as reckless as a child?

862
01:00:26,104 --> 01:00:28,625
Why am l

863
01:00:28,745 --> 01:00:31,506
Like a racehorse runnin' wild?

864
01:00:32,106 --> 01:00:34,587
Why am l

865
01:00:34,707 --> 01:00:37,788
ln a state of ecstasy?

866
01:00:38,428 --> 01:00:42,589
The reason is cos something's
happened to me

867
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:45,191
l'm in love again

868
01:00:46,231 --> 01:00:48,872
And the spring is comin'

869
01:00:48,992 --> 01:00:50,953
l'm in love again

870
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:54,675
Hear my heartstrings strummin'

871
01:00:54,795 --> 01:00:56,756
l'm in love again

872
01:00:57,356 --> 01:01:00,397
And the hymn they're hummin'

873
01:01:00,517 --> 01:01:05,519
ls those cuddle-up, huddle-up blues

874
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:07,600
l'm in love again

875
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,761
And l can't rise above it

876
01:01:11,881 --> 01:01:14,002
l'm in love again

877
01:01:14,122 --> 01:01:17,362
And l love, love, love it

878
01:01:18,084 --> 01:01:20,605
- Thanks for a swell time.
- lf you didn't like it,

879
01:01:20,725 --> 01:01:22,325
you didn't have to talk over him.

880
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:25,726
- l was so bored.
- Tough. You don't deserve Cole Porter!

881
01:01:25,847 --> 01:01:28,367
Stay with groups that look like
they'll stab their mothers.

882
01:01:28,488 --> 01:01:32,290
- At least l'm open to new concepts.
- And you snort cocaine all the time.

883
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:34,410
Do you carry a kilo in your purse?

884
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:37,971
This crowd wouldn't know the difference.
They're embalmed.

885
01:01:38,091 --> 01:01:41,772
l'm glad Hannah got us together.
She's got a great instinct for people.

886
01:01:41,893 --> 01:01:44,533
- l'm sorry it didn't work out.
- Yeah, me too.

887
01:01:44,654 --> 01:01:47,975
- l've been a little depressed lately.
- l had a great time tonight.

888
01:01:48,095 --> 01:01:51,856
- lt was like the Nuremberg trials.
- l'll see myself home!

889
01:01:53,978 --> 01:01:56,018
Yep, it was quite an evening.

890
01:01:56,178 --> 01:01:58,739
Holly with her cocaine. Jesus!

891
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:02,301
She should have been wearing
a gold shovel around her neck.

892
01:02:02,461 --> 01:02:05,982
She was polymorphously
insensitive, l think.

893
01:02:06,143 --> 01:02:07,463
Too bad, too,

894
01:02:07,583 --> 01:02:10,704
because l always had
a little crush on her.

895
01:02:43,717 --> 01:02:45,678
You just have to read the instructions.

896
01:02:45,798 --> 01:02:49,319
You set one of these things
and you can take pictures underwater.

897
01:02:49,439 --> 01:02:51,880
When we get to the country,
we'll try it in the lake.

898
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:53,961
- Can l try?
- Yeah, OK.

899
01:03:03,445 --> 01:03:05,485
Are you in a bad mood?

900
01:03:05,606 --> 01:03:08,046
l don't know. l'm just antsy.

901
01:03:08,167 --> 01:03:11,088
Yes, l know. The last few weeks
you haven't been yourself.

902
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:14,568
And tonight at dinner
you were kind of curt with me.

903
01:03:14,689 --> 01:03:16,530
- Was l?
- Yes, you were.

904
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:21,051
And when l brought up the idea of having
a baby, you jumped down my throat.

905
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:24,093
- Well, l don't think it's a very good idea.
- Why not?

906
01:03:24,213 --> 01:03:27,374
Because it's the last thing
in the world we need right now.

907
01:03:27,494 --> 01:03:29,654
Why do you say that?
ls something wrong?

908
01:03:29,775 --> 01:03:32,656
- l don't know.
- Well, tell me. Should l be worried?

909
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:36,657
- Well, you got four children.
- l want one with you.

910
01:03:36,777 --> 01:03:40,699
Well... l think we should
wait till things settle.

911
01:03:40,819 --> 01:03:42,859
What does that mean?

912
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:46,421
We've been married four years.
How settled can things get?

913
01:03:46,541 --> 01:03:50,102
You have some very set plans on
how your life should be structured.

914
01:03:50,223 --> 01:03:53,905
A house, kids, certain school,
a home in Connecticut...

915
01:03:54,025 --> 01:03:56,385
lt's all very... preconceived.

916
01:03:56,746 --> 01:03:59,667
Yeah, but l... l thought you needed that.

917
01:03:59,787 --> 01:04:02,067
When we met,
you said your life was chaos.

918
01:04:02,188 --> 01:04:05,709
l know, but there's
gotta be some give and take.

919
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:09,709
Oh, listen. l don't know
what the hell l'm talking about.

920
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:11,951
- Are you angry with me?
- No!

921
01:04:12,071 --> 01:04:15,512
Do you feel, um...
Are you disenchanted with our marriage?

922
01:04:15,633 --> 01:04:17,914
- l didn't say that.
- Do you love someone else?

923
01:04:18,073 --> 01:04:21,634
My God, what is this? The Gestapo? No!

924
01:04:21,795 --> 01:04:24,916
- What are you not telling me?
- What kind of interrogation...?

925
01:04:25,076 --> 01:04:28,598
Suppose l said ''Yes, l am disenchanted,
l am in love with someone else''?

926
01:04:28,718 --> 01:04:31,558
- Are you?
- No!

927
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:35,920
But you keep asking awful questions.
lt's like you want me to say yes!

928
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:40,482
What are you talking about?
Of course not. l'd be destroyed.

929
01:04:40,602 --> 01:04:43,322
For Christ's sake, stop torturing her.

930
01:04:43,443 --> 01:04:46,124
Tell her you want out and get it over with.

931
01:04:46,245 --> 01:04:50,046
You're in love with her sister.
You didn't do it on purpose.

932
01:04:50,167 --> 01:04:53,247
Be honest. lt's always the best way.

933
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:55,567
Can l help you?

934
01:04:55,688 --> 01:04:58,769
lf you're suffering over something,
will you share it with me?

935
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:00,851
Hannah.

936
01:05:01,611 --> 01:05:03,771
You know how much l love you.

937
01:05:05,852 --> 01:05:09,413
l ought to have my head examined.
l don't deserve you.

938
01:05:16,256 --> 01:05:19,457
l want to look good,
but l don't want to feel overdressed.

939
01:05:19,578 --> 01:05:21,939
- No, not at all.
- Well, how about this?

940
01:05:22,059 --> 01:05:25,580
l really like that.
l think that's a pretty colour on you.

941
01:05:25,701 --> 01:05:28,861
Ever think you'd be helping me
buy something to wear to the opera?

942
01:05:28,982 --> 01:05:31,102
l think it's great. l can't wait to meet him.

943
01:05:31,222 --> 01:05:35,463
He's married and his wife's in and out
of institutions. She's schizophrenic.

944
01:05:35,584 --> 01:05:38,424
Sometimes she's terrific,
and then she just breaks down.

945
01:05:38,545 --> 01:05:43,387
He has a sweet daughter. When she goes
to college, he's gonna split permanently.

946
01:05:43,507 --> 01:05:46,908
He's paid his dues, but she helped
him through architectural school.

947
01:05:47,028 --> 01:05:49,108
You found all this out on one date?

948
01:05:49,229 --> 01:05:52,590
l figured he's dying to open up. lt's so sad.

949
01:05:52,711 --> 01:05:55,592
Now, what should l wear to my audition?

950
01:05:55,712 --> 01:05:59,633
l've got a singing audition for a Broadway
musical. Of course, l'll never get it.

951
01:05:59,753 --> 01:06:01,514
- Singing?
- Can you believe it?

952
01:06:01,634 --> 01:06:04,674
- Really?
- Well, l mean, why not, you know?

953
01:06:04,796 --> 01:06:10,317
- What have l got to lose?
- l know, l just... l didn't know you sang.

954
01:06:11,158 --> 01:06:13,519
You think everybody in
musicals sings so well?

955
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:15,399
No, no.

956
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:17,400
Just that... they sing.

957
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,481
Well, you know...

958
01:06:20,802 --> 01:06:24,844
- l sing a little. l mean...
- Oh, l know. No, l know.

959
01:06:26,004 --> 01:06:28,645
Don't say that, cos confidence
is not my strong point.

960
01:06:28,805 --> 01:06:31,245
No, l'm sorry. l didn't mean that.

961
01:06:31,406 --> 01:06:33,326
l think l can fake my way through a song.

962
01:06:33,487 --> 01:06:35,407
- Uh-huh?
- Easily.

963
01:06:37,528 --> 01:06:42,049
- Why? You don't think it's realistic?
- No, l didn't... That's... No.

964
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:46,652
l just hate to see you put yourself
in a position where you get hurt.

965
01:06:46,772 --> 01:06:49,052
You know how you take
every single rejection

966
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:52,453
as a confirmation that you
have no talent or something.

967
01:06:52,574 --> 01:06:55,375
- Yeah, well, maybe l'll get it.
- l hope.

968
01:06:55,495 --> 01:06:58,456
Boy, you really know
how to cut me down.

969
01:06:58,577 --> 01:07:01,417
What? No, don't be so sensitive.
Can't l say anything?

970
01:07:01,537 --> 01:07:05,018
Well, l sing! For Christ's sake,
Hannah, you heard me sing!

971
01:07:05,139 --> 01:07:07,699
OK! What happened?

972
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:12,942
We were having a really nice time, and
suddenly everything went to bad feeling.

973
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:15,703
Nobody but you can do that to me.
l don't know why.

974
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:18,503
Look, everything's going your way.

975
01:07:19,545 --> 01:07:22,105
You're right. l'm happy!

976
01:07:23,946 --> 01:07:28,106
Why must l let my insecurities
spoil everything?

977
01:07:28,508 --> 01:07:31,828
This year's fancies

978
01:07:31,949 --> 01:07:35,390
Are passing fancies

979
01:07:35,511 --> 01:07:37,511
But sighing sighs

980
01:07:37,631 --> 01:07:39,511
Holding hands

981
01:07:39,632 --> 01:07:41,432
This my heart

982
01:07:41,553 --> 01:07:43,674
Understands

983
01:07:44,354 --> 01:07:47,515
l'm old-fashioned

984
01:07:47,635 --> 01:07:51,276
And l don't mind it

985
01:07:51,397 --> 01:07:55,277
lt's how l want to be

986
01:07:55,399 --> 01:07:59,399
As long as you'll agree

987
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:05,802
To stay old-fashioned

988
01:08:05,923 --> 01:08:09,683
With me

989
01:08:09,844 --> 01:08:11,445
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

990
01:08:11,565 --> 01:08:13,926
- lt was very nice.
- Terrific.

991
01:08:14,085 --> 01:08:15,806
April Knox?

992
01:08:22,489 --> 01:08:24,850
Someday

993
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:27,930
When l'm awfully low

994
01:08:28,411 --> 01:08:31,091
When the world is cold

995
01:08:31,692 --> 01:08:33,492
l will get a glow

996
01:08:33,654 --> 01:08:37,294
Just thinking of you

997
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:43,296
And the way you look tonight

998
01:08:44,817 --> 01:08:47,417
You sounded great.
You may be surprised.

999
01:08:47,539 --> 01:08:50,820
l'm glad we have a catering job
this week. l'm low on money.

1000
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:54,621
Yeah, we have Mr Morris Levine's
80th birthday on Riverside Drive,

1001
01:08:54,741 --> 01:08:58,022
or Riverside Memorial Chapel,
depending on his health.

1002
01:08:58,143 --> 01:09:00,384
Oh, listen. David called me up.

1003
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:01,624
What?

1004
01:09:01,744 --> 01:09:05,865
David called me last night.
He wants to take me to the opera.

1005
01:09:05,986 --> 01:09:08,947
- l didn't know what to say.
- You're joking.

1006
01:09:09,067 --> 01:09:11,227
No, he called late last night.

1007
01:09:12,469 --> 01:09:15,069
l, uh... l'm very surprised.

1008
01:09:15,189 --> 01:09:17,830
He wanted to take me to see Rigoletto.

1009
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:20,832
- And you're going?
- Well, l didn't know what to say.

1010
01:09:20,952 --> 01:09:22,952
First l said no, but then he pressed it.

1011
01:09:23,073 --> 01:09:27,233
He said he'd taken you once
and he really wanted to invite me.

1012
01:09:28,874 --> 01:09:31,275
- But l'm seeing him.
- l know, l said that.

1013
01:09:31,396 --> 01:09:35,477
But he said it was something
he really felt like doing.

1014
01:09:35,597 --> 01:09:37,517
Gee, um...

1015
01:09:37,638 --> 01:09:40,199
l don't know what to say.

1016
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:45,401
lt's just an evening at the opera.
Did l do wrong in accepting?

1017
01:09:46,321 --> 01:09:48,081
Huh?

1018
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:56,325
Why do you think that you would
like to convert to Catholicism?

1019
01:09:56,445 --> 01:10:00,726
Well, because l've gotta have something
to believe in, or life is meaningless.

1020
01:10:00,847 --> 01:10:06,169
l understand, but why did you make the
decision to choose the Catholic faith?

1021
01:10:06,290 --> 01:10:09,090
First of all because it's
a very beautiful religion

1022
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:11,971
and it's a strong religion.
lt's very well structured.

1023
01:10:12,091 --> 01:10:16,372
l mean the against-school-prayer,
pro-abortion, anti-nuclear wing.

1024
01:10:16,533 --> 01:10:18,494
So at the moment
you don't believe in God?

1025
01:10:18,655 --> 01:10:23,576
No, and l want to. l'm willing to do
anything. l'll dye Easter eggs, if it works.

1026
01:10:23,737 --> 01:10:26,177
l need some evidence.
l gotta have some proof.

1027
01:10:26,338 --> 01:10:29,818
lf l can't believe in God,
then l don't think life is worth living.

1028
01:10:29,979 --> 01:10:33,980
- lt means making a very big leap.
- Yes, well, can you help me?

1029
01:10:34,141 --> 01:10:36,701
Why? Oh, my God!

1030
01:10:36,821 --> 01:10:39,582
l don't understand.
l thought you'd be happy.

1031
01:10:39,743 --> 01:10:42,583
- How can we be happy?
- Because l never thought of God before.

1032
01:10:42,703 --> 01:10:46,264
- Now l'm giving it some thought.
- Catholicism? Why not your own people?

1033
01:10:46,385 --> 01:10:51,347
Because l got off to a wrong foot with
my own thing. l need a dramatic change.

1034
01:10:51,467 --> 01:10:55,269
- You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
- l know it sounds funny, but l'll try.

1035
01:10:55,389 --> 01:10:58,629
- But why? We raised you as a Jew.
- Just cos l was born that way...

1036
01:10:58,749 --> 01:11:01,830
- l'm old enough to make decisions.
- But why Jesus Christ?

1037
01:11:01,951 --> 01:11:06,032
- Why shouldn't you become a Buddhist?
- That's totally alien to me.

1038
01:11:06,152 --> 01:11:08,193
You're old. Aren't you afraid of dying?

1039
01:11:08,314 --> 01:11:10,795
- Why should l be afraid?
- Cos you won't exist.

1040
01:11:10,915 --> 01:11:12,755
- So?
- That doesn't terrify you?

1041
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:15,877
Who thinks about such nonsense?
When l'm dead, l'll be dead.

1042
01:11:15,997 --> 01:11:19,037
- But aren't you frightened?
- Of what? l'll be unconscious.

1043
01:11:19,158 --> 01:11:21,158
l know, but never to exist again?

1044
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:23,878
- How do you know?
- lt doesn't look promising.

1045
01:11:23,999 --> 01:11:27,880
Who knows what l'll be?
l'll either be unconscious or l won't.

1046
01:11:28,001 --> 01:11:31,362
lf not, l'll deal with it then.
l'm not gonna worry now.

1047
01:11:31,483 --> 01:11:32,923
Mom, come out!

1048
01:11:33,043 --> 01:11:37,164
Of course there's a God,
you idiot! You don't believe in God?

1049
01:11:37,285 --> 01:11:39,965
lf there's a God, why is there
so much evil in the world?

1050
01:11:40,086 --> 01:11:42,767
On a simplistic level,
why were there Nazis?

1051
01:11:42,887 --> 01:11:45,888
- Tell him, Max.
- How the hell do l know?

1052
01:11:46,008 --> 01:11:48,408
l don't know how the can opener works.

1053
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,441
- Hi.
- Hi. Where's Holly?

1054
01:13:10,561 --> 01:13:13,761
She's auditioning for a TV commercial.
She said she'd be late.

1055
01:13:13,883 --> 01:13:17,844
- How's she doing?
- When she's depressed, she's manic.

1056
01:13:17,964 --> 01:13:20,325
l think it was a good idea
to invite her to lunch.

1057
01:13:20,445 --> 01:13:25,446
l hope you say it was your idea. Every
time l try to help, she gets so defensive.

1058
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:28,408
She's just embarrassed
in front of you, that's all.

1059
01:13:28,528 --> 01:13:30,368
- So how are you?
- Me? l'm OK.

1060
01:13:30,489 --> 01:13:32,089
- Do you miss Frederick?
- No.

1061
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:35,131
Elliot and l can't think of anyone
for you to go out with...

1062
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:38,932
How are you? Are you doing OK?
How's Frederick? l mean, Elliot?

1063
01:13:39,052 --> 01:13:44,134
l guess he's fine. l don't know. He's been
kinda moody lately, the last few months.

1064
01:13:44,254 --> 01:13:47,374
l don't know what's wrong.
He's distant and difficult.

1065
01:13:47,496 --> 01:13:50,176
When l try to talk to him,
he says everything's fine.

1066
01:13:50,296 --> 01:13:53,977
l just leap to the worst conclusion,
that he's seeing someone else or...

1067
01:13:54,098 --> 01:13:56,459
Oh, no. Everyone thinks things like that.

1068
01:13:56,579 --> 01:14:01,260
Well, l just came from an audition
which l did not get. So what's new?

1069
01:14:01,381 --> 01:14:04,903
- They said l was too offbeat-looking.
- What the hell do they know?

1070
01:14:05,022 --> 01:14:07,222
- And guess who's there, auditioning.
- April?

1071
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:09,663
- Oh, gosh.
- You got it. l was very polite.

1072
01:14:09,784 --> 01:14:12,745
l maintained my poise. l said hello.

1073
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:16,226
l never trusted April.
She has eyes in the back of her head.

1074
01:14:16,387 --> 01:14:20,988
She and the architect are now a very
definite item, which l still cannot believe,

1075
01:14:21,109 --> 01:14:24,149
although it's put an end to the
Stanislavski Catering Company.

1076
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:26,830
l have to speak to you,
and you're gonna get impatient,

1077
01:14:26,951 --> 01:14:29,072
but l have to borrow some more money.

1078
01:14:29,192 --> 01:14:32,792
- Well, that's fine...
- What l've decided to do is some writing.

1079
01:14:32,953 --> 01:14:36,834
l've had it with acting. These
meaningless auditions are cattle-calls.

1080
01:14:36,955 --> 01:14:40,236
l can't handle another rejection.
You know, let's face it here.

1081
01:14:40,396 --> 01:14:43,437
l've gotta latch onto something in my life.

1082
01:14:43,598 --> 01:14:48,919
Something with a future.
l'm not 16 any more. lt's just... crazy.

1083
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:53,440
But l've got an idea for a story,
more than one,

1084
01:14:53,561 --> 01:14:57,122
and l just need a few months,
or a year, even.

1085
01:14:57,242 --> 01:15:00,683
l've picked up a lot about
dramatic structure from acting class.

1086
01:15:00,804 --> 01:15:06,005
That's good. lt just seems to me
that... six months or a year,

1087
01:15:06,127 --> 01:15:08,447
if you spent it more productively...

1088
01:15:08,567 --> 01:15:11,687
- Like what?
- Well, l don't know. Um...

1089
01:15:11,808 --> 01:15:15,730
Didn't Mom mention there was something
at the Museum of Broadcasting?

1090
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:20,291
- That's clerical.
- No, it was in the publicity department.

1091
01:15:20,411 --> 01:15:23,652
- That can lead to other things.
- l knew you'd be discouraging!

1092
01:15:23,773 --> 01:15:25,973
l'm not. l'm trying to be helpful.

1093
01:15:26,094 --> 01:15:30,375
You don't just say one day ''l'm
finished as an actress. Now l'm a writer.''

1094
01:15:30,496 --> 01:15:33,456
- You mean, not at my age.
- Please, we came to have lunch.

1095
01:15:33,576 --> 01:15:37,017
Yeah, OK, right. Forget it. What's to eat?

1096
01:15:37,139 --> 01:15:40,420
l just want a salad.
You really think l'm a loser, don't you?

1097
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:42,860
- You're being ridiculous.
- You are. Stop it.

1098
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:45,221
- You treat me like a loser.
- How?

1099
01:15:45,342 --> 01:15:48,343
You never have faith in my plans,
you undercut my enthusiasm...

1100
01:15:48,463 --> 01:15:50,903
Not so, no. l think
l've been very supportive.

1101
01:15:51,023 --> 01:15:53,784
l try to give you honest,
constructive advice.

1102
01:15:53,904 --> 01:15:56,025
l'm always happy to help you financially.

1103
01:15:56,146 --> 01:15:59,547
l've gone out of my way to introduce you
to interesting single men...

1104
01:15:59,667 --> 01:16:02,228
- They're all losers.
- You're too demanding.

1105
01:16:02,348 --> 01:16:05,509
l could tell what you thought of me
by the men you fixed me up with.

1106
01:16:05,629 --> 01:16:07,990
- That's not true!
- l know l'm mediocre.

1107
01:16:08,110 --> 01:16:11,391
Would you stop attacking Hannah?
She's going through a rough time.

1108
01:16:11,512 --> 01:16:14,953
- Why are you so upset?
- You've picked on her since she came in.

1109
01:16:15,073 --> 01:16:17,194
Leave her alone. l'm suffocating.

1110
01:16:17,314 --> 01:16:19,914
What's the matter, Lee?
Why are you so sensitive?

1111
01:16:20,035 --> 01:16:22,676
Listen. You wanna write, write.

1112
01:16:22,796 --> 01:16:24,916
Let's just not talk about it any more.

1113
01:16:25,077 --> 01:16:28,518
Take a year, take six months,
whatever you want.

1114
01:16:28,678 --> 01:16:32,359
Who knows? Maybe you'll
be sitting with a good play.

1115
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,880
What's the matter with you?
You look pale. Are you OK?

1116
01:16:36,002 --> 01:16:38,242
Yeah, you know, l'm just...

1117
01:16:38,402 --> 01:16:43,003
l've got dizzy all of a sudden and
l have a headache. l think we need to eat.

1118
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:04,171
l can't seem to take action.
l'm like Hamlet, unable to kill his uncle.

1119
01:17:04,292 --> 01:17:07,694
l want Lee, but l can't harm Hannah.

1120
01:17:07,814 --> 01:17:10,774
And in no other area
am l a procrastinator.

1121
01:17:13,055 --> 01:17:16,617
Meanwhile, Lee has no direction.
She's taking courses at Columbia.

1122
01:17:16,737 --> 01:17:18,617
Butjust randomly.

1123
01:17:18,738 --> 01:17:22,019
l try not to call her, but then she calls me,

1124
01:17:22,139 --> 01:17:27,861
and then l call, and we try to resist
meeting, but once in a while we meet.

1125
01:17:27,982 --> 01:17:31,423
Sometimes we argue because
l can't break up my marriage.

1126
01:17:31,543 --> 01:17:36,344
Sometimes we wind up making love,
and we both feel terrible.

1127
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:38,585
But it's my fault.

1128
01:17:39,866 --> 01:17:44,347
For all my education, accomplishments
and so-called wisdom,

1129
01:17:44,468 --> 01:17:47,349
l can't fathom my own heart.

1130
01:17:47,469 --> 01:17:49,269
Krishna, Krishna

1131
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:51,710
Hare, Hare...

1132
01:17:51,831 --> 01:17:54,031
Why do you want to be a Hare Krishna?

1133
01:17:54,151 --> 01:17:59,592
Well, l'm not saying l want to join, but l
know you guys believe in reincarnation.

1134
01:17:59,713 --> 01:18:02,554
- What's your religion?
- l was born Jewish.

1135
01:18:02,675 --> 01:18:06,035
Last winter l tried to become a Catholic,
and it didn't work for me.

1136
01:18:06,157 --> 01:18:08,157
l studied and l gave it everything,

1137
01:18:08,277 --> 01:18:11,638
but Catholicism for me was:
die now, pay later.

1138
01:18:11,759 --> 01:18:15,239
- l couldn't get with it, and l wanted to.
- Are you afraid of dying?

1139
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:17,680
Well, yeah, naturally. Aren't you?

1140
01:18:17,801 --> 01:18:21,242
Does reincarnation mean my soul
would pass to another human being,

1141
01:18:21,362 --> 01:18:24,243
or would l come back as a moose
or an aardvark or something?

1142
01:18:24,404 --> 01:18:28,485
Take our literature,
read it over and think about it.

1143
01:18:28,605 --> 01:18:32,566
- OK. Thank you very much.
- You're welcome. Hare Krishna.

1144
01:18:35,368 --> 01:18:38,088
Who are you kidding?
You're gonna be a Krishna?

1145
01:18:38,249 --> 01:18:42,009
You're gonna shave your head and put on
robes and dance around at airports?

1146
01:18:42,170 --> 01:18:44,651
You'll look like Jerry Lewis.

1147
01:18:44,811 --> 01:18:46,731
God, l'm so depressed.

1148
01:18:56,535 --> 01:18:59,296
The nights are really getting cooler.

1149
01:18:59,417 --> 01:19:03,138
Summer went so quickly. Soon it'll be fall.

1150
01:19:05,099 --> 01:19:07,740
My literature professor really likes me.

1151
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:10,781
lt was fun being out with him last night.

1152
01:19:10,902 --> 01:19:15,103
Funny, l feel like l'm betraying Elliot,
but that's ridiculous.

1153
01:19:15,223 --> 01:19:18,343
Why shouldn't l see Doug?
Elliot's not free.

1154
01:19:19,385 --> 01:19:21,346
Just go one step at a time.

1155
01:19:22,386 --> 01:19:25,226
Let's see what the next few months bring.

1156
01:19:25,987 --> 01:19:28,027
Hannah? Hi!

1157
01:19:28,148 --> 01:19:32,789
Listen, you'll be happy to know that your
money has not gone completely to waste.

1158
01:19:32,910 --> 01:19:36,751
No, l have an actual first rough draft
of something l wrote.

1159
01:19:36,871 --> 01:19:38,872
Yeah, yeah.

1160
01:19:38,992 --> 01:19:42,033
l showed it to Lee and
she gave me some good pointers.

1161
01:19:42,154 --> 01:19:45,794
Listen, l'm pretty near where you live.
Could l just drop it off?

1162
01:19:45,915 --> 01:19:50,437
When you have some time, read it,
and we'll talk at Thanksgiving.

1163
01:19:50,557 --> 01:19:53,558
OK? All right. Oh, wait, listen.

1164
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:59,600
l think Lee met an interesting guy
at Columbia. He sounds really nice.

1165
01:20:00,641 --> 01:20:05,083
Yeah, OK, all right. Well,
we'll talk at Thanksgiving. Bye-bye.

1166
01:20:06,483 --> 01:20:09,683
Now, here's a song that Norma sang

1167
01:20:09,804 --> 01:20:12,525
on that trip we made
up to the show in Buffalo.

1168
01:20:12,646 --> 01:20:15,486
And, oh, was she beautiful that night!

1169
01:20:15,606 --> 01:20:18,127
- Come on!
- Oh, yes, you were, dear.

1170
01:20:18,248 --> 01:20:22,249
Don't you remember that night?
She was so beautiful

1171
01:20:22,369 --> 01:20:24,649
that when men saw her
walking along the street,

1172
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:28,491
they'd drive their cars
right up on the sidewalk.

1173
01:20:28,652 --> 01:20:31,293
- That right, honey?
- A slight exaggeration.

1174
01:20:31,413 --> 01:20:33,374
But only slight.

1175
01:20:58,904 --> 01:21:00,944
You've been very cold to me tonight.

1176
01:21:01,064 --> 01:21:02,664
No.

1177
01:21:02,785 --> 01:21:04,946
ls something wrong?

1178
01:21:05,066 --> 01:21:08,026
Not here.
There are too many people around.

1179
01:21:09,868 --> 01:21:11,508
Hey, Hannah?

1180
01:21:11,628 --> 01:21:17,069
l think Lee is really serious about
her new boyfriend. He sounds really nice.

1181
01:21:17,190 --> 01:21:20,151
l'm so happy for her. l think she's in love.

1182
01:21:20,272 --> 01:21:23,953
- Hey, what's the matter?
- l'm real upset about what you wrote.

1183
01:21:24,073 --> 01:21:26,793
- My script?
- lt's obviously based on Elliot and me.

1184
01:21:26,914 --> 01:21:30,275
- Oh, so loosely.
- No, not loosely. Real specifically!

1185
01:21:30,396 --> 01:21:31,956
ls that how you see us?

1186
01:21:32,076 --> 01:21:36,477
Can l not accept gestures and feelings
from people? Do l put people off?

1187
01:21:36,598 --> 01:21:39,158
- lt's a made-up story.
- No, it's real exact!

1188
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:41,520
The situations, dialogue, everything.

1189
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:44,681
lt's full of intimate details
between Elliot and me,

1190
01:21:44,801 --> 01:21:47,921
which l don't see how you
could even possibly know about!

1191
01:21:48,042 --> 01:21:50,203
A conversation we once had
about adoption?

1192
01:21:50,324 --> 01:21:53,765
Lee mentioned that to me,
so obviously you discussed it with her.

1193
01:21:53,885 --> 01:21:56,126
l took the essence and
l blew it up into drama.

1194
01:21:56,246 --> 01:21:59,807
How could Lee know about these things?
l don't tell her everything.

1195
01:21:59,927 --> 01:22:01,647
Wow. l guess l hit a nerve.

1196
01:22:01,767 --> 01:22:06,168
You make it sound like l have no needs.
You think l'm too self-sufficient?

1197
01:22:06,289 --> 01:22:08,770
Hannah, that's not what l meant.
You know?

1198
01:22:08,891 --> 01:22:11,571
Everybody relies on you
for so much. You're so giving!

1199
01:22:11,692 --> 01:22:13,972
lt's no criticism.
We love you, we're grateful.

1200
01:22:14,093 --> 01:22:16,253
You're grateful but you resent me.

1201
01:22:16,374 --> 01:22:19,935
Wow. l don't wanna have this
conversation. l didn't do anything wrong.

1202
01:22:20,055 --> 01:22:22,895
You told me yourself
you and Elliot were having problems.

1203
01:22:23,017 --> 01:22:25,457
We were, but they're my business.

1204
01:22:25,617 --> 01:22:28,057
l don't see how you could
know it in such detail!

1205
01:22:28,218 --> 01:22:31,659
How does Lee know about these things?
How? They're private!

1206
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:35,461
- Why don't you share them with us?
- l don't want to bother everyone.

1207
01:22:35,581 --> 01:22:38,102
That's the point. l'd like to be bothered.

1208
01:22:38,222 --> 01:22:41,743
How could you know about these things?
Has Elliot been talking to you?

1209
01:22:41,904 --> 01:22:45,425
No, he hasn't. lf l offended you, l'm sorry.

1210
01:22:48,547 --> 01:22:51,507
lt's over, Elliot.
l don't know how to be any clearer.

1211
01:22:51,667 --> 01:22:54,227
- l know l deserve it...
- l'm just as much at fault.

1212
01:22:54,348 --> 01:22:57,709
- l have such feelings for you...
- l've got to be honest with you.

1213
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:58,830
l've met someone else.

1214
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:01,310
- What do you mean?
- l've met someone else.

1215
01:23:01,431 --> 01:23:05,232
- l told you l wouldn't wait for ever.
- lt hasn't been for ever.

1216
01:23:05,353 --> 01:23:08,554
lt's been nearly a year and
you're still married to my sister,

1217
01:23:08,674 --> 01:23:12,395
which l now realise is fine. You're much
more in love with her than you know.

1218
01:23:12,516 --> 01:23:16,077
- But we made so many plans.
- And in a way you led me on.

1219
01:23:16,197 --> 01:23:18,517
l truly believed you were
unhappy with Hannah.

1220
01:23:18,638 --> 01:23:20,838
Otherwise l would
never have been drawn in.

1221
01:23:20,958 --> 01:23:24,319
l was very weak. So were you.
Now l've met someone...

1222
01:23:27,681 --> 01:23:30,442
- Dinner soon?
- About 1 5 minutes.

1223
01:23:32,763 --> 01:23:35,924
- But you're in love overnight.
- l care a great deal about him, yes.

1224
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:39,765
- Lee...
- lt's over. Elliot, l mean it. lt's over.

1225
01:23:42,807 --> 01:23:46,368
Sweetheart, l loved your script.
l thought it was so clever.

1226
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:49,289
You're my mother.
Not everybody's gonna be such a sucker.

1227
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:51,771
l particularly liked
the character of the mother,

1228
01:23:51,891 --> 01:23:55,251
just a boozy old flirt with a filthy mouth.

1229
01:23:55,372 --> 01:23:57,733
- l'm so proud!
- Oh, Mom, thanks.

1230
01:23:58,693 --> 01:24:00,854
Here's a toast to Thanksgiving, all right?

1231
01:24:00,975 --> 01:24:04,575
Are we supposed to have beer?
Yes, let me hear it!

1232
01:24:04,696 --> 01:24:06,495
How's that, Fletcher?

1233
01:24:06,617 --> 01:24:10,578
Doll, to Thanksgiving. Here's a little
toast, doll. Come on, bottoms up!

1234
01:24:11,178 --> 01:24:15,139
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee
about us, about our personal life?

1235
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:16,860
Me? Of course not.

1236
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:21,901
Holly wrote things about us that are so
personal, they must have come from you.

1237
01:24:22,022 --> 01:24:24,663
l've got a headache and
l don't like being accused!

1238
01:24:24,783 --> 01:24:30,705
l'm not accusing, l'm asking. Do you
find me too giving, too competent?

1239
01:24:30,866 --> 01:24:33,826
- Too disgustingly perfect or something?
- No.

1240
01:24:33,987 --> 01:24:37,028
What is it? What's come between us?
How have l alienated you?

1241
01:24:37,148 --> 01:24:40,429
- Hannah, my head is throbbing.
- You never wanna talk about it.

1242
01:24:40,590 --> 01:24:44,471
Every time l bring it up,
you change the subject. What is it?

1243
01:24:44,591 --> 01:24:47,311
We're communicating less,
you sleep with me less...

1244
01:24:47,432 --> 01:24:50,233
Hannah, l am very mixed up! Now, please!

1245
01:24:50,394 --> 01:24:53,514
Do you talk to Holly or Lee
behind my back? Do you?

1246
01:24:53,675 --> 01:24:55,875
You must. They seem to
know so much about us.

1247
01:24:56,035 --> 01:24:58,836
Maybe l've asked advice
once or twice, or made a joke.

1248
01:24:58,957 --> 01:25:02,638
Do you talk to Holly, or Lee,
or what? Do you phone them?

1249
01:25:02,758 --> 01:25:04,719
Leave me alone, can you?!

1250
01:25:04,839 --> 01:25:07,680
Jesus, l've told you.
l need someone l can matter to!

1251
01:25:08,081 --> 01:25:10,201
You matter to me, completely.

1252
01:25:10,321 --> 01:25:14,123
lt's hard to be around someone who gives
so much and needs so little in return.

1253
01:25:14,243 --> 01:25:16,043
l have enormous needs.

1254
01:25:16,164 --> 01:25:19,524
Well, l can't see them,
and neither can Lee or Holly!

1255
01:26:17,587 --> 01:26:20,348
lt's so pitch black tonight.

1256
01:26:22,029 --> 01:26:23,989
l feel lost.

1257
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:27,311
You're not lost.

1258
01:26:36,555 --> 01:26:38,516
l love you so much.

1259
01:27:26,854 --> 01:27:30,896
l don't know if you remember me, but we
had the worst night of my life together.

1260
01:27:31,016 --> 01:27:33,136
- l remember you.
- Yes, you do recall?

1261
01:27:33,257 --> 01:27:37,218
l was walking past and l just
saw you and l thought l'd come in.

1262
01:27:37,339 --> 01:27:41,099
- We didn't hit it off.
- We did all but exchange gunshots.

1263
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:43,460
- How are you?
- Good. You look wonderful.

1264
01:27:43,581 --> 01:27:45,781
- Oh, no.
- Yeah? No, you do.

1265
01:27:45,901 --> 01:27:49,502
lt was a terrible evening. Remember
slamming the cab door in my face?

1266
01:27:49,623 --> 01:27:52,944
You came dangerously close
to emasculating my nose

1267
01:27:53,064 --> 01:27:56,465
- in a really horrible way.
- That was a long time ago.

1268
01:27:56,586 --> 01:27:58,466
- People change.
- l hope you've changed.

1269
01:27:58,587 --> 01:28:00,667
- l hope you have too.
- l hope so, for your sake.

1270
01:28:00,788 --> 01:28:05,469
Your personality left something
to be desired, namely a personality.

1271
01:28:05,589 --> 01:28:07,869
So how are you? What are you doin'?

1272
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:11,392
Oh, nothing much. Just some stuff.
Little of this, little of that.

1273
01:28:11,512 --> 01:28:15,473
Was that an embarrassing question?
Are you out of work or something?

1274
01:28:15,593 --> 01:28:19,394
- No, well, l've been trying to write.
- Have you? That's interesting.

1275
01:28:19,514 --> 01:28:21,555
- What kind of stuff?
- Oh...

1276
01:28:21,676 --> 01:28:24,717
- You're not interested in this.
- No, you can tell me. l am.

1277
01:28:24,837 --> 01:28:27,277
Millions must say to you
''l've written something.''

1278
01:28:27,398 --> 01:28:29,519
- Nobody ever said it. This is it.
- Really?

1279
01:28:29,639 --> 01:28:34,920
- Would you be willing to read something?
- Yes, if it would mean anything to you.

1280
01:28:35,041 --> 01:28:38,882
l don't know why it would.
You've always hated my taste in the past.

1281
01:28:39,002 --> 01:28:41,043
- No, l haven't!
- You have.

1282
01:28:41,203 --> 01:28:46,165
l think it might make a great television
script, and you're so active in television.

1283
01:28:46,325 --> 01:28:50,006
Not any more.
l haven't been in television for a year.

1284
01:28:50,167 --> 01:28:54,848
No, l may have to get back into it cos my
accountant says l'm running out of cash.

1285
01:28:55,009 --> 01:28:59,370
But no, l sort of dropped out for a year,
which is a long, dull story.

1286
01:28:59,531 --> 01:29:02,611
- You're OK, though?
- Yes, l'm fine. How are you?

1287
01:29:02,771 --> 01:29:04,451
- l'm fine.
- What about your script?

1288
01:29:04,572 --> 01:29:07,933
l'd love it if you'd read it
cos l really would value your opinion.

1289
01:29:08,054 --> 01:29:11,975
But you have to remember while you're
reading and you're cursing my name

1290
01:29:12,095 --> 01:29:15,056
that this is my first script.
Well, it's not my first.

1291
01:29:15,177 --> 01:29:18,618
That was about Hannah and
her husband, but Hannah read it.

1292
01:29:18,738 --> 01:29:21,058
She got really angry and l felt badly.

1293
01:29:21,179 --> 01:29:25,980
- l can't imagine what you wrote.
- lt wasn't anything bad, but l don't know...

1294
01:29:26,101 --> 01:29:29,062
So l threw it out, but l have this other one.

1295
01:29:29,182 --> 01:29:32,542
Well, you know,
if you want me to, l would read it.

1296
01:29:32,663 --> 01:29:35,304
l don't know... Could l come over
tomorrow and read it to you?

1297
01:29:35,424 --> 01:29:39,145
Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
You must be joking!

1298
01:29:39,266 --> 01:29:42,347
l've been doing
all my own reading since l was 40.

1299
01:29:42,467 --> 01:29:45,307
l think it's lucky l ran into you. Maybe.

1300
01:29:45,428 --> 01:29:47,389
What about me? l should have kept going.

1301
01:29:47,509 --> 01:29:51,230
l have a nagging sensation
that l should have kept walking

1302
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:53,591
and not begun this conversation.

1303
01:29:54,752 --> 01:29:57,393
''We all go through life
playing the hand we're dealt.''

1304
01:29:57,513 --> 01:30:00,594
''Craig: And what hand were you dealt?''

1305
01:30:00,714 --> 01:30:05,195
''Emily: l'm two high pair,
maybe even aces up.''

1306
01:30:05,316 --> 01:30:08,277
''The problem is,
you've got three deuces.''

1307
01:30:09,558 --> 01:30:11,518
That's the end.

1308
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:17,361
No, you can tell me straight.
lt's okay. Just tell me what you think.

1309
01:30:17,481 --> 01:30:19,121
lt's great.

1310
01:30:19,242 --> 01:30:21,402
l'm... speechless.

1311
01:30:22,003 --> 01:30:25,844
l was not in the mood
to listen to this thing now.

1312
01:30:27,564 --> 01:30:31,325
l don't know what to say.
l'm moved and l laughed and l...

1313
01:30:31,446 --> 01:30:33,807
l was on the edge of my seat.
lt's wonderful.

1314
01:30:33,927 --> 01:30:37,167
l'm totally stunned. This is not an insult.

1315
01:30:37,288 --> 01:30:41,409
l'm amazed that you can...
l just thought it was great.

1316
01:30:41,570 --> 01:30:44,131
- Really?
- Yes. l was absolutely...

1317
01:30:44,252 --> 01:30:47,052
What made you think
of that climax scene,

1318
01:30:47,172 --> 01:30:50,533
where the architect is walking home
with his actress girlfriend

1319
01:30:50,654 --> 01:30:54,055
and the schizophrenic ex-wife
jumps out and stabs him to death?

1320
01:30:54,215 --> 01:30:57,976
- lt just came to me one day.
- lt was just fabulous.

1321
01:30:58,136 --> 01:31:00,297
Gosh, you really think l can write?

1322
01:31:00,458 --> 01:31:03,258
There's one or two things
l would do differently myself,

1323
01:31:03,419 --> 01:31:06,580
but who cares? lt was fabulous.

1324
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:11,702
l mean lt. l'm so impressed!
l am. You've made my day.

1325
01:31:11,822 --> 01:31:16,103
lt was just great.
l was set to be bored stiff.

1326
01:31:16,224 --> 01:31:20,425
- Would you like to have lunch?
- l would love to talk about the script.

1327
01:31:20,545 --> 01:31:22,865
- l think we could do something with it.
- OK.

1328
01:31:22,986 --> 01:31:26,307
And l'd like to hear what made you
suddenly decide to drop out of life.

1329
01:31:26,427 --> 01:31:28,908
- Who cares?
- No, l care.

1330
01:31:29,028 --> 01:31:31,709
You used to be so ambitious and...

1331
01:31:31,830 --> 01:31:33,990
God, you really liked it?!

1332
01:31:55,399 --> 01:31:59,721
Gosh, you really went through a crisis,
you know that? How did you get over it?

1333
01:31:59,841 --> 01:32:05,242
When l ran into you, you seemed
just perfectly fine. You seem fine now.

1334
01:32:05,363 --> 01:32:10,124
Well, l'll tell you. One day,
about a month ago, l really hit bottom.

1335
01:32:10,245 --> 01:32:14,606
ljust felt that in a Godless universe,
l didn't want to go on living.

1336
01:32:14,726 --> 01:32:19,968
Now, l happen to own this rifle, which
l loaded and pressed to my forehead,

1337
01:32:20,088 --> 01:32:22,489
and l remember thinking.;
l'm gonna kill myself.

1338
01:32:22,610 --> 01:32:25,371
Then l thought.; what ifl'm wrong?

1339
01:32:25,491 --> 01:32:28,532
What ifthere is a God?
After all, nobody really knows that.

1340
01:32:28,652 --> 01:32:31,892
But then l thought.;
no, maybe is not good enough.

1341
01:32:32,013 --> 01:32:34,414
l want certainty or nothing.

1342
01:32:34,534 --> 01:32:37,494
And l remember very clearly
the clock was ticking

1343
01:32:37,616 --> 01:32:40,536
and l was sitting there, frozen,
with the gun to my head,

1344
01:32:40,656 --> 01:32:42,937
debating whether to shoot.

1345
01:32:45,178 --> 01:32:50,540
All ofa sudden, the gun went off. l had
been so tense, l'd squeezed the trigger.

1346
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:54,981
But l was perspiring so much, the gun
had slid offmy forehead and missed me.

1347
01:32:55,102 --> 01:32:58,983
Neighbours were pounding on the door

1348
01:32:59,144 --> 01:33:02,104
and, l don't know, the whole scene
wasjust pandemonium.

1349
01:33:02,225 --> 01:33:07,666
And l ran to the door, l didn't know what
to say. l was embarrassed and confused.

1350
01:33:07,827 --> 01:33:11,948
My mind was racing a mile a minute,
and ljust knew one thing.

1351
01:33:12,068 --> 01:33:18,270
l had to get out ofthat house, just
get out in the fresh air and clear my head.

1352
01:33:18,391 --> 01:33:22,032
And l remember very clearly
l walked the streets.

1353
01:33:22,153 --> 01:33:27,994
l didn't know what was going through my
mind. lt all seemed so violent and unreal.

1354
01:33:28,115 --> 01:33:31,556
And l wandered for a long time
on the Upper West Side.

1355
01:33:31,677 --> 01:33:36,958
lt must have been hours. My feet hurt and
my head was pounding. l had to sit down.

1356
01:33:37,078 --> 01:33:41,159
l went into a movie house. l didn't know
what was playing. ljust needed a moment

1357
01:33:41,281 --> 01:33:43,681
to gather my thoughts and be logical

1358
01:33:43,801 --> 01:33:47,122
and put the world
back into rational perspective.

1359
01:33:55,606 --> 01:33:58,847
And l went upstairs
to the balcony and l sat down.

1360
01:33:58,967 --> 01:34:04,008
The movie was a film that l'd seen
many times in my life since l was a kid,

1361
01:34:04,129 --> 01:34:06,209
and l always loved it.

1362
01:34:06,330 --> 01:34:08,691
And l'm watching these people
up on the screen

1363
01:34:08,811 --> 01:34:11,931
and l started getting hooked on the film.

1364
01:34:12,052 --> 01:34:18,334
And l started to feel.; how can you even
think ofkilling yourself?. lsn't that stupid?

1365
01:34:18,455 --> 01:34:20,495
Look at all the people on the screen.

1366
01:34:20,616 --> 01:34:23,976
They're real funny, and
what ifthe worst is true?

1367
01:34:24,096 --> 01:34:28,178
What ifthere's no God and you
only go around once and that's it?

1368
01:34:28,299 --> 01:34:30,660
Don't you want to be
part ofthe experience?

1369
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:33,500
What the hell? lt's not all a drag.

1370
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:36,860
l'm thinking to myself.;
l should stop ruining my life,

1371
01:34:36,982 --> 01:34:41,903
searching for answers l'm never gonna
get, andjust enjoy it while it lasts.

1372
01:34:42,064 --> 01:34:46,665
And after, who knows? Maybe there
is something. Nobody really knows.

1373
01:34:46,785 --> 01:34:52,387
l know ''maybe'' is a slim reed to hang
your life on, but it's the best we have.

1374
01:34:52,507 --> 01:34:57,869
Then l started to sit back and
l actually began to enjoy myself.

1375
01:34:58,030 --> 01:34:59,510
Oh, Freedonia

1376
01:34:59,670 --> 01:35:01,310
Oh, don't you cry for me

1377
01:35:01,471 --> 01:35:03,391
Cos l'm coming round the mountain

1378
01:35:04,472 --> 01:35:05,793
Um...

1379
01:35:05,953 --> 01:35:09,995
Look, there's something that's been
bothering me for a long time.

1380
01:35:10,155 --> 01:35:14,916
l just thought l'd tell you what it was
and just sort of clear the deck here.

1381
01:35:15,036 --> 01:35:19,197
l've always regretted the way l behaved
that evening we went out.

1382
01:35:19,318 --> 01:35:23,239
- l just thought l'd tell you that...
- Don't be silly. Don't be ridiculous.

1383
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:26,400
l was the... You know, it was my fault.

1384
01:35:27,842 --> 01:35:32,523
So you wanna go out to dinner again?
Do you have any interest in that?

1385
01:35:32,643 --> 01:35:35,844
- Sure.
- Are you free this evening?

1386
01:35:35,965 --> 01:35:37,885
Yeah, yeah.

1387
01:35:43,768 --> 01:35:45,928
l want ice! Who's got some?

1388
01:35:46,048 --> 01:35:47,528
Oh, there it is.

1389
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:49,650
Hey, where's Holly? She's late.

1390
01:35:49,770 --> 01:35:52,531
Did you read Holly's last thing?
She's really developed.

1391
01:35:52,651 --> 01:35:54,652
She really writes good dialogue.

1392
01:35:54,772 --> 01:35:57,172
Hannah, can l say you're
going to play Desdemona?

1393
01:35:57,293 --> 01:36:00,654
- Mom, it's only television.
- But it's public television.

1394
01:36:00,774 --> 01:36:03,695
To me, Shakespeare doesn't
get any greater than Othello.

1395
01:36:03,816 --> 01:36:07,857
- You with some big, black stud. l love it!
- Oh, honey!

1396
01:36:32,747 --> 01:36:35,628
Oh, Lee. You are something.

1397
01:36:36,668 --> 01:36:40,629
You look very beautiful.
Marriage agrees with you.

1398
01:36:42,871 --> 01:36:47,632
Everything that happened between us
seems more and more hazy.

1399
01:36:48,953 --> 01:36:52,914
l acted like such a fool.
l don't know what came over me.

1400
01:36:53,475 --> 01:36:57,235
The complete conviction
that l couldn't live without you.

1401
01:36:57,916 --> 01:37:00,197
What l put us both through!

1402
01:37:00,318 --> 01:37:05,239
And Hannah, who, as you once said,
l love much more than l realised.

1403
01:37:09,001 --> 01:37:12,402
Hi! Happy Thanksgiving!

1404
01:37:13,763 --> 01:37:17,403
- Hi, Daisy. l didn't miss dinner, did l?
- No.

1405
01:37:17,525 --> 01:37:20,485
Hi, Marge. Happy Thanksgiving!

1406
01:37:20,605 --> 01:37:23,566
Happy Thanksgiving, Amy.

1407
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:24,230
lt's beautiful.

1408
01:38:27,632 --> 01:38:29,632
- Don't be nervous. lt's your husband.
- Hi.

1409
01:38:29,752 --> 01:38:31,392
- Hi. How are you doing?
- Okay.

1410
01:38:31,513 --> 01:38:34,074
- When did you get here?
- Just a few minutes ago.

1411
01:38:34,194 --> 01:38:36,314
- You look so beautiful.
- Thanks.

1412
01:38:36,435 --> 01:38:40,595
l was talking to your father before.
l was telling him that it's ironic.

1413
01:38:40,716 --> 01:38:43,357
l used to always have
Thanksgiving with Hannah.

1414
01:38:43,478 --> 01:38:46,719
l never thought that
l could love anybody else.

1415
01:38:46,839 --> 01:38:52,201
And here it is, years later, and l'm married
to you, and completely in love with you.

1416
01:38:52,321 --> 01:38:56,162
The heart is a very,
very resilient little muscle.

1417
01:38:58,204 --> 01:39:03,046
lt would make a great story, l think. A guy
marries one sister and it doesn't work out.

1418
01:39:03,205 --> 01:39:08,087
Then, years later,
he winds up married to the other sister.

1419
01:39:08,287 --> 01:39:11,008
l don't know how you're gonna top that.

1420
01:39:12,129 --> 01:39:14,049
- Mickey?
- What?

1421
01:39:15,410 --> 01:39:17,330
l'm pregnant.
