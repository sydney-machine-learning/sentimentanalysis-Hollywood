2
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,379
Jets!

3
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,299
Hey, hey!

4
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,495
Come on.

5
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,587
Ha!

6
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,269
Yeah! Come on, come on!

7
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,160
Beat it.

8
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,137
Oh, yeah!

9
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,942
Hey!

10
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,510
Hey!

11
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,646
Hey, you! Come on!

12
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,173
Jets!

13
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,342
Come on, Baby John!

14
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:19,303
Hey!

15
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,875
Alright now, all you separate!

16
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,126
Separate! Separate!

17
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,587
You're driving me to my grave,
ya pack of jackals.

18
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:50,884
Watch yourself, Sergeant Krupke,

19
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:51,961
you're gonna inflame your asthma,

20
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,045
shouting like that.

21
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,968
Why don't you leave
the Puerto Ricans alone, Riff?

22
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:58,221
Christ almighty. And you lot,

23
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,393
you're in New York now.

24
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,936
You got a problem, you call the cops.

25
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,889
Youse can't play
at being cops yourselves.

26
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:06,851
<i>Pero</i> we call the cops,
you show up and arrest us!

27
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,902
You're never around
when these <i>hijueputas</i>

28
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,730
mess up our stores and our streets.

29
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,781
See, I get confused
when you say "our streets,"

30
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,608
seeing how these streets
are ours by right

31
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,319
- of being born here, <i>amigo.</i>
- The Jets!

32
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:20,702
How many times do I gotta tell you,
Bernardo?

33
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,078
I don't speak spic.

34
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,784
Hey, hey!

35
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:24,868
That's enough! That's enough!

36
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,751
Come on! Break it up!

37
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,920
Jesus wept, Baby John.

38
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,839
Who did that to your ear?

39
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,432
Ow!

40
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,721
Which one of them nailed you?

41
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,604
Who cracked your head open, <i>hombre?</i>

42
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,531
In English.

43
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,819
Same guy who nailed your ear, maybe?

44
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,369
Maybe. I don't remember.

45
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,042
I realise if any of you helps me out,

46
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,335
you might spoil your chance
to murder each other

47
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:09,914
over control of this earthly paradise.

48
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,124
The Jets control it and you know it.

49
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,584
Uh-huh, yeah,

50
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,510
but, golly gee, Balkan, not according

51
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:17,929
to the New York City Committee
for Slum Clearance,

52
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:20,348
which has decided
to pull this whole hellmouth

53
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,596
down to the bedrock,

54
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,347
and you're in the way.

55
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,475
Aah!

56
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,945
Nice reflexes, <i>muchacho.</i>

57
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,981
So, any day now,

58
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,532
all of you are gonna be evicted.

59
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,986
You'll have to "vamoose,"
as we say in Spanish.

60
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,320
We're not relocating.

61
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,955
We have rights.

62
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,413
Rights, huh? Where are they?

63
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:51,170
You back down, Bernardo.
Don't be stupid.

64
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,094
Some night, <i>muchacho,</i>

65
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,800
maybe you'll get to see me fight.

66
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,303
'Course, you'll have to leave
your gun at home, Lieutenant.

67
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,600
Evict yourself off my crime scene,
Bernardo.

68
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,849
<i>Vamos.</i>

69
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,825
Chick, chick, chick.

70
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,154
Chickie, chickie, chickie.

71
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,084
A boxer and a singer.

72
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,539
Get a load of this guy.

73
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,814
You want me to book
the whole bunch of you?

74
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,891
Keep up the serenade and see what...

75
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,774
<i>¡Viva Puerto Rico libre!</i>

76
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,951
I am ordering you clowns to disperse!

77
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:06,822
Now!

78
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,840
We're outnumbered, boys.

79
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,891
Thousands more are on their way,

80
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:28,184
and once they're here,

81
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,808
they pop out kids like crazy.
Am I right?

82
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,473
Tell me which one of them
nailed Baby John's ear

83
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,229
and I'll put him out of circulation.

84
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,893
Work with me, fellas.

85
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,399
Or they're gonna drive you
off your turf.

86
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,400
You said it was
the Slum Clearance Committee

87
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,526
that was driving us off,

88
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,029
now it's the PRs.

89
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,702
You gotta get your story straight,
Lieutenant Schrank.

90
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,529
We're very impressionable.

91
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,452
Most of the white guys
who grew up in this slum

92
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,658
climbed their way out of it.

93
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,085
Irish, Italian, Jews.

94
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,413
Nowadays, their descendants
live in nice houses

95
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,123
and drive nice cars

96
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:01,051
and date nice girls you'd want to marry.

97
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:04,346
Your dads or your granddads stayed put,

98
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,511
drinking and knocking up
some local piece

99
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:09,309
who gave birth to you.

100
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,931
The last of the
can't-make-it Caucasians.

101
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,226
What's a gang without its terrain,
its turf?

102
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,061
You're a month or two away
from finding out,

103
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,987
one step ahead of the wrecking ball.

104
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,530
And in this uncertain world,

105
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:25,609
the only thing you can count on is me.

106
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,193
I'm here to keep the civil peace

107
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,619
until the last building falls.

108
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,992
And if you boys make trouble

109
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,040
on my turf, Riff, hand to heart,

110
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,992
you're headed to an upstate prison cell

111
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,953
for a very long time.

112
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,834
By the time you get out,

113
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:43,134
this will be a shiny new neighbourhood
of rich people

114
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,383
in beautiful apartments

115
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:50,304
with Puerto Rican doormen
to chase trash like you away.

116
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,722
Wait!

117
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,648
I got a question for you, Lieutenant.

118
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,486
How tall did you used to be before you,

119
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:06,907
you know, "schrank"?

120
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,658
Come on, Sergeant, ride with me.

121
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,034
Long as I know you, Riff,

122
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:14,082
you ain't had the sense,
God gave a pigeon.

123
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,204
Come here, let's see what he done.

124
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,873
Come on.

125
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,842
Well, that's gonna scar, buddy boy.

126
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,637
- You think so?
- Frankenstein time.

127
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,180
They can't make us up and leave.

128
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,257
We're here, ain't we?

129
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,809
American citizens,
which them spics ain't!

130
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,226
Them they can chase off, not us.

131
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,349
Puerto Ricans are Americans,

132
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,896
- you ignoramus.
- Ah, go eat a green banana!

133
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:38,940
Puerto Rico's like a state,
ain't it? So, Deez is right...

134
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,017
No, it's something else.

135
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:41,272
There are only 48 states,

136
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,523
- ya dead battery.
- What do you know?

137
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,944
Whatever they are,

138
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:46,649
citizens or who gives a fart,
what we know is...

139
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,404
They ain't us.

140
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,781
So, spill it, Krazy Kat,
what are you thinking?

141
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,290
I'm thinking it's past time
for a rumble.

142
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,539
For a all-in, all-out, once-and-for-all,

143
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,870
winner-takes-all, high-noon-shootout-

144
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,956
at-the-O.K. Corral rumble!

145
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,088
Wild blue yonder! About time!

146
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,509
We do 'em like we done
the Egyptian Kings.

147
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:07,802
- And the Emeralds.
- And the Bishops.

148
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,629
Alright, so Tony and me
will sit down with...

149
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:10,930
- Tony?
- Yeah, Tony.

150
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:12,052
What's this got to do with him?

151
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,383
He ain't stood with us
once since he got out.

152
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:15,469
He's on parole.
He's gotta be careful, is all.

153
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,678
He cannot be running around...

154
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,229
Tony's done with the Jets, Riff.

155
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,432
He ain't done with the Jets.
Like that's even a thing!

156
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:21,812
You cannot be done with this family.

157
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,270
Maybe it wasn't a thing before,
but now, Riff?

158
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,187
The Lieutenant's right.

159
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,114
What are the Jets
if we got no territory?

160
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,362
- That's right!
- Yeah.

161
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:32,069
Schrank doesn't know
his ass from his elbow.

162
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,698
Look,

163
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,452
Tony and me started the Jets

164
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,828
cause none of us would even be here

165
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,205
if it wasn't for all of us.

166
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,328
And all you know it.

167
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:44,289
<i>When you're a Jet
You're a Jet all the way</i>

168
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:47,627
<i>From your first cigarette
To your last dyin' day</i>

169
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,963
<i>When you're a Jet
If the spit hits the fan</i>

170
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:54,641
<i>You got brothers around
You're a family man</i>

171
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,058
<i>You're never alone</i>

172
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:57,970
<i>You're never disconnected</i>

173
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,396
<i>You're home with your own</i>

174
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:02,019
<i>When company's expected</i>

175
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,851
<i>You're well-protected</i>

176
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,812
<i>Then you are set with a capital J</i>

177
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,069
<i>Which you'll never forget
Till they cart you away</i>

178
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,149

180
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,913
<i>Jet</i>

181
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,871
So, meet Tony and me
at the Dog Days Dance

182
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:21,952
at the gym tonight.

183
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,208
We can't rumble at the gym,
it'll be lousy with cops!

184
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,584
And maybe we've had enough trouble

185
00:15:25,675 --> 00:15:26,836
with the Puerto Ricans for one day?

186
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,258
Relax. It's a social mixer.

187
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,837
So we'll mix until the time's right

188
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,888
to fix the rumble for tomorrow night.

189
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,424
Be there 10:00 p.m., punctual-like,

190
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:38,260
dressed to kill, walking tall!

191
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:40,140
We always walk tall! We're Jets!

192
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,770
The greatest.

193
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,850
<i>When you're a Jet
You're the top cat in town</i>

194
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:48,733
<i>You're the gold-medal kid
With the heavyweight crown</i>

195
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:49,904
<i>When you're a Jet</i>

196
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:53,279
<i>You're the swingin'est thing
Little boy, you're a man</i>

197
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,326
<i>Little man
You're a king</i>

198
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,744
<i>The Jets are in gear</i>

199
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,072
<i>Our cylinders are clickin'</i>

200
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,120
<i>The Sharks'll steer clear</i>

201
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,202
<i>Cause every
Puerto Rican's a lousy chicken</i>

202
00:16:04,714 --> 00:16:07,422
<i>Here come the Jets
Like a bat out of hell</i>

203
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:10,717
<i>Someone gets in our way
Someone don't feel so well</i>

204
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,087
<i>Here come the Jets
Little world, step aside</i>

205
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,843
<i>Better go underground</i>

206
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,469
<i>Better run, better hide</i>

207
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,515
<i>We're drawin' the line
So keep your noses hidden</i>

208
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,269
<i>We're hangin' a sign
Says "Visitors Forbidden"</i>

209
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,941
<i>And we ain't kiddin'</i>

210
00:16:27,195 --> 00:16:30,108
<i>Here come the Jets, yeah
And we're gonna beat</i>

211
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,407
<i>Every last buggin' gang
On the whole buggin' street</i>

212
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,824
<i>On the whole</i>

213
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:37,198
<i>Ever mother-lovin'</i>

214
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:42,829
<i>Street</i>

215
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,455
<i>Yeah!</i>

216
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,756
- Can.
- Come on.

217
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,333
Just for an hour, only a little hour.

218
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,714
You used to like dancing.

219
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,545
- No monkeyshines.
- Come on, Riff, can.

220
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,842
Christ almighty. You know,
there's dust on everything.

221
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:00,926
You know, ever since...

222
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,556
Hey, I swear on what's holy,

223
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:05,480
it is just girls sipping punch
and music...

224
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,727
- And the Sharks.
- And the spics.

225
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:07,898
- And a rumble.
- Which all you gotta do...

226
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,975
You're on your own, pal-o-mine.

227
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,185
...is help me haggle
over the terms of the rumble.

228
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,690
You don't need me helping ya
screw up your life.

229
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,442
You know how I get.
I will start runnin' my mouth.

230
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,399
You... You got command.

231
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,700
You are West Side legendary! And, Tony,

232
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:21,371
Tony, the Jets.
I gave 'em my word you'd show.

233
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,449
- Why would you do that?
- Because...

234
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,292
Because it's a rumble!

235
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,835
We need you if we're going to war.

236
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:30,755
You can't refuse us now.
And because I know you.

237
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,207
Or I thought I did,

238
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,541
before you got all unlike yourself,

239
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,297
before you went upstate.

240
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,633
Tony?

241
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,464
I'm coming!

242
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:44,477
It's like you're still in prison,

243
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,430
and the old witch is the warden.

244
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,108
She gave me a job and a place to stay.

245
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,278
She's always been there
for me, like nobody else.

246
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:55,947
- Oh, nobody, huh? Thanks, pal.
- So don't call her...

247
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,023
Thanks a big fat lot. Yeah.

248
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,155
You know I didn't mean you wasn't there.

249
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,735
You was always there.

250
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,413
- Womb to tomb.
- Sperm to worm.

251
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,083
So, come with me to the dance, huh?

252
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,409
Come on.

253
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,209
Is it Graziella? That what's eatin' you?

254
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:16,384
No, it ain't Grazie.

255
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,505
She said that you and she was done.

256
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:18,587
It's good that
you're keeping her company.

257
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:19,762
Even before you got locked up, you know?

258
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,216
It's cool. Don't get all
the way you get.

259
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:27,555
Grazie's a great girl,
and the Jets are the greatest.

260
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:31,061
And you, you're like,
you know, blood to me.

261
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,066
But I'm scared of myself, Riff.

262
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,579
What I done to that kid.
What I almost done.

263
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,030
You gotta get over that.

264
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,615
What is the point
in beating yourself up?

265
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,876
I wanna be unlike how I was.

266
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,749
Cause I was disappearing down a sewer

267
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,921
and taking you and everything with me.

268
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,919
- Tony, you coming?
- Yeah, he heard ya!

269
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,843
I had time. Lots of it.

270
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,841
Locked up like that,

271
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:06,973
and for the first time ever,
I took a look inside,

272
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,638
and that was rough, doing that,

273
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:13,184
but I... I gotta stay with myself.

274
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,945
You know what I mean? Maybe stay...

275
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,074
by myself, just for...

276
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,150
Yeah, you know what?

277
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:23,734
You're just too deep for me, kid.

278
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,659
You know, I don't know who I am.

279
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:27,864
And who cares who I am?

280
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,494
Nobody, including me.

281
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,167
I know that this dust

282
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,789
that's covering everything right now,

283
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,084
that's the four-story buildings
that was standing here

284
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,131
when you went upstate a year ago.

285
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:39,505
You know, I wake up to everything I know

286
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,051
either getting sold or wrecked,

287
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:43,800
or being taken over by people
that I don't like.

288
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,097
And they don't like me.

289
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,425
And you know what's left
out of all that?

290
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,852
The Jets.

291
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:54,483
My guys. My guys, who are just like me.

292
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:57,773
Who are just like you.

293
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,570
I can't go to the dance, Riff!

294
00:19:59,657 --> 00:20:02,149
My parole officer said no going out!

295
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,448
I told you I don't want you in my store.

296
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,204
I'm a paying customer.

297
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,749
You've been stealing from me
since you were six.

298
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,456
Now, get out. I mean it.

299
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,337
And leave Tony alone.

300
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,299
He is not allowed to associate
with criminals.

301
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:24,879
Look, don't fall off that ladder.

302
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,966
At your age, brittle bones.
That's all I'm saying.

303
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,767
You'll pay for that candy.

304
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:32,516
Five cents. On the counter!

305
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:36,190
Stand me for a Milky Way, huh?
Least you could do.

306
00:20:37,445 --> 00:20:38,981
Womb to tomb

307
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,487
wasn't never a joke for me.

308
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,988
Don't be like that.

309
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,237
Just cause I can't go to a dance?

310
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:51,073
Tony, I don't tell you
who to hang out with. But...

311
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:55,661
"But those
boys are juvenile delinquent.

312
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:59,255
"They're no good for you.
And you better watch out."

313
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,502
Hey.

314
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,379
"You make fun of the way I talk

315
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,881
"one more time, blondie..."

316
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,171
I'm gonna
talk to Riff and tell him

317
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,973
that he can't just
come in here and not pay.

318
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:12,260
Tony, wake up.

319
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:16,393
I know you love Riff,
but he hates Puerto Ricans.

320
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,770
That is not you.

321
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,146
Riff don't hate you.

322
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:22,232
I married a gringo.

323
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,405
He thinks that makes me a gringa,

324
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,529
which it don't. And I ain't.

325
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,741
Well, it's guys like Riff and me,

326
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,868
when things ain't familiar,

327
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,746
we just got this instinct to,
you know...

328
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:38,919
You...

329
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,337
even as an angry little boy,
somehow there was this...

330
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:47,136
this promise
that you couldn't keep hidden.

331
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,260
Not from you.

332
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:53,518
And sometimes, I see you smiling,

333
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,512
like you're waiting for the,

334
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:58,769
what do you call, Irish Sweepstakes,

335
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,692
instead of sweeping the floor
like I pay you to do.

336
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,561
I sweep as good as you pay.

337
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,442
- Yeah?
- Look it.

338
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,282
Ooh.

339
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,406
You see? Promise.

340
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:18,459
You bring dead floors back to life.

341
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:23,210
Keep looking for better, <i>mi milagro.</i>

342
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,171
Like you always done.

343
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:41,023
<i>Could be?</i>

344
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,434
<i>Who knows?</i>

345
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:48,990
<i>There's something due any day
I will know right away</i>

346
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:52,910
<i>Soon as it shows</i>

347
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,362
- <i>It may come cannonballing</i>
- Aah!

348
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,038
<i>Down through the sky
Gleam in its eye</i>

349
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:59,243
<i>Bright as a rose</i>

350
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,750
<i>Who knows?</i>

351
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:07,835
<i>It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach</i>

352
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,137
<i>Under a tree</i>

353
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,676
<i>I got a feeling there's a miracle due</i>

354
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,757
<i>Gonna come true</i>

355
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:19,471
<i>Coming to me</i>

356
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:22,766
<i>Could it be? Yes, if could</i>

357
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,272
<i>Something's coming
Something good</i>

358
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,729
<i>If I can wait</i>

359
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,941
<i>Something's coming
I don't know what it is</i>

360
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:35,029
<i>But it is gonna be great</i>

361
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,454
<i>With a click, with a shock</i>

362
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,124
<i>Phone'll jingle, door'll knock</i>

363
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,542
<i>Open the latch</i>

364
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:44,746
<i>Something's coming
Don't know when</i>

365
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,626
<i>But it's soon
Catch the moon</i>

366
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:49,334
<i>One-handed catch</i>

367
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:54,389
<i>Around the corner</i>

368
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:59,561
<i>Or whistling down the river</i>

369
00:23:59,647 --> 00:24:04,187
<i>Come on, deliver</i>

370
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:09,066
<i>To me</i>

371
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:12,198
<i>Will it be? Yes, it will</i>

372
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,742
<i>Maybe just by holding still</i>

373
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,944
<i>It'll be there</i>

374
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:19,496
<i>Come on, something
Come on in</i>

375
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,449
<i>Don't be shy
Meet a guy</i>

376
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,205
<i>Pull up a chair</i>

377
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:29,211
<i>The air is humming</i>

378
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:33,295
<i>And something great is coming</i>

379
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,925
<i>Who knows?</i>

380
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:43,354
<i>It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach</i>

381
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,933
<i>Maybe tonight</i>

382
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:50,691
<i>Maybe tonight</i>

383
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:55,776
<i>Maybe tonight</i>

384
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:11,332
María!

385
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,184
María!

386
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,603
They're gonna be here in five minutes.

387
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,164
<i>Mamita.</i>

388
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,583
Didn't you hear me...?

389
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,260
What are you doing? <i>Ay, nena...</i>

390
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,882
No, no, no, no.

391
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:58,963
It look like a shroud,

392
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,469
it's so big and so white.

393
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,675
It wouldn't look like a shroud
if it was red.

394
00:26:11,445 --> 00:26:12,731
Speak English.

395
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,983
In Gimbels, there are lots
of dresses that fit me.

396
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:18,533
And you don't shop in Gimbels.
You clean in Gimbels.

397
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:19,950
<i>- Ay.</i>
- Mm.

398
00:26:20,037 --> 00:26:21,778
<i>Ahorrar tus chavitos,</i>

399
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:22,987
fancy pants.

400
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,289
Aw. <i>Sí.</i>

401
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:32,080
<i>Ay,</i> turn around.

402
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,513
Hmm.

403
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,610
<i>Ay,</i> Anita.

404
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,112
Oh!

405
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,069
<i>Ay,</i> don't mess up my hair.

406
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,745
I just got it to act right.

407
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,363
Ugh. OK.

408
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:12,210
Get your shoes on.

409
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,832
Bernardo will be so mad
if we make him late.

410
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,842
And I want to dance.

411
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,470
Bernardo's always mad.

412
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,097
<i>Necesito</i> lipstick.

413
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,222
I'm too short. I need, please.

414
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:35,105
Please, some lipstick,
and maybe some eyeliner.

415
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,526
- Hmm.
- The boys think I'm a kid.

416
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:37,819
You are a kid, kiddo.

417
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,271
I'm 18. I have a job.

418
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,277
I've been taking care of <i>Papi</i>
since I was six.

419
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:42,608
Bernardo thinks I'm a baby.

420
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,819
Who cares what Bernardo thinks?

421
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,031
Chino is the only boy who counts.

422
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:49,741
Oh, Chino. <i>Mi primer baile
en Nueva York</i>

423
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,122
and I have to go with
the <i>zángano</i> I don't want to.

424
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,453
<i>Ay,</i> be nice. Chino is a very sweet boy.

425
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,754
You can't take that personally.

426
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,630
He's got to be like that.

427
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:03,463
It's how he got to be a great boxer.

428
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:04,888
Everyone's afraid of him.

429
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,306
Mm, but I'm not.

430
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,179
Anita, we're home.

431
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,980
Are you ready? Chino's here.

432
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,324
You gotta dance with her.

433
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,528
- I don't know how to dance.
- <i>Ay.</i>

434
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,749
She's bossy. She gonna show you how.

435
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,497
Don't move.

436
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,256
You always look out for me.

437
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,212
You're the best friend I ever had.

438
00:28:44,306 --> 00:28:45,717
I owe you so much.
But I just wish that...

439
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,845
You're the smartest friend I ever had.

440
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,060
Maria needs to meet smart guys like you.

441
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,227
Let me join the Sharks.

442
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:53,930
<i>Ay, muchacho,</i> not this again.

443
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,105
<i>Por favor,</i> let me help you
protect our people.

444
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:56,182
No.

445
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,688
You keep out of that. It's stupid.

446
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,440
We gotta do it, but it's stupid.

447
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:04,865
María can't like a <i>lambeojo</i>
who just works day and night.

448
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,693
Never stands up like her brother does.

449
00:29:06,787 --> 00:29:07,822
She says all the time

450
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,654
she doesn't want anyone like me.

451
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,407
Just be Chino.

452
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,204
But be a Chino who dances.

453
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,506
You look like <i>Mami.</i>

454
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,679
And, Chino, <i>qué guapo.</i>

455
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,881
He took off from night school

456
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,307
just so he could take you to the dance.

457
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:31,384
<i>Gracias,</i> Chino.

458
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:34,311
Night school, accounting, and...

459
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,432
And, Chino, what else
are you learning about?

460
00:29:38,527 --> 00:29:40,109
Adding machine repair.

461
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,435
And just think,

462
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,646
how many adding machines
in New York City.

463
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,151
Chino is gonna be rich.

464
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:46,403
Well, not exactly, <i>pero...</i>

465
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,483
Boxers get rich.

466
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,989
Boxers get their brains knocked out.

467
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,371
Bossy, <i>como te dije,</i>

468
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,039
<i>y una</i> wiseass.

469
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,293
The gringos tonight,
they stare because...

470
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,370
Oh, like you don't stare.

471
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,047
Because our girls
make their girls look lousy.

472
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,462
The first gringo boy
who smiles at you... Pow!

473
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:10,389
<i>Ay,</i> Mr. Juvenile <i>Delincuente.</i>

474
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:11,590
<i>Vamos.</i>

475
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,050
I fold you she likes him.

476
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,360
You want her to pick him,

477
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:26,030
keep telling her she has to like him.

478
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,833
Hey, get away from her, you lesbo!

479
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:30,044
- Get out of here!
- Hey, hey, what are you doing?

480
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,369
How about you give me some room?

481
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,415
You wanna dance, buddy?

482
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,663
Get back!

483
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,589
Let's back up! Back up!

484
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,931
Everyone, keep calm now!

485
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:00,350
Contain the aggression, OK?

486
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,098
What's the matter with you guys?

487
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:03,645
Pretty girls wanting to dance

488
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:06,064
and all youse can think of
is to beat up on each other.

489
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:08,313
Thank you, Officer.

490
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,189
Alright! Alright!

491
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,898
So, tonight is a social experiment,
boys and girls,

492
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,859
brotherhood and all that,
and you're the guinea pigs.

493
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,248
Thank you, right on cue.

494
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,160
Be nice to each other!
Give us some hope!

495
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,335
Just for a little bit,

496
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,629
then you can revert back
10 your true feral selves.

497
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:33,584
Now, boys,
get into a big circle facing in.

498
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,589
And, girls, make a small circle

499
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,216
on the inside, facing out.

500
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,053
Speak English
in school-sponsored functions!

501
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,639
Now, everyone, please!

502
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,975
You heard the man! All youse fall in!

503
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:51,727
Hey!

504
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,201
Hey! Bernardo!

505
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,331
Anita!

506
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,017
Hey, buddy!

507
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:25,636
Yeah, Riff!

508
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,146
- OK.
- Sorry.

509
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:33,773
- Excuse us.
- I'm sorry.

510
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,917
Boys, step it right. Girls, left.

511
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,119
And when the music stops,

512
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,420
ya dance with whoever's in front of ya.

513
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:30,167
Come on! Give it a chance!
It's gonna...

514
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,836
- Mambo!
- Mambo!

515
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:37,916
Go!

516
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:47,635
Tony!

517
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,186
Anybodys!

518
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,604
- Good to see ya.
- Whoa!

519
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,683
Tony, I knew you'd come, buddy boy.
I knew you'd come.

520
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,145
Hey! Come and dance, yeah?

521
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:58,319
Yeah!

522
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,988
Mambo!

523
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,337
Mambo!

524
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,391
Alright. Let's go, boys!

525
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:28,888
Let's go, boys!

526
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,310
Oh... Yeah!

527
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:41,063
Yeah!

528
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,363
Hey!

529
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:44,616
No, no, no. I just wanna
give him a talk real quick.

530
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,822
- Hey, Bernardo!
- Riff!

531
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:13,937
Bernardo!

532
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,667
Chino!

533
00:40:10,867 --> 00:40:13,859
It's funny, I wasn't planning
on showin' up tonight.

534
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,281
You don't like dancing?

535
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,162
No.

536
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,455
I mean, yeah.

537
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,825
I like it.

538
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,208
I like it a lot, dancing with you.

539
00:40:27,175 --> 00:40:28,961
It's just, you're, uh...

540
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,461
You're tall.

541
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,845
Yeah, I know.

542
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:38,133
You're not.

543
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,144
You're not Puerto Rican?

544
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,179
You're just figuring that out?

545
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,231
From down here, I wasn't sure.

546
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:50,275
Is that OK? That I'm not?

547
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,693
I don't know.

548
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,942
Since I...

549
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,031
I never seen you before.

550
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,244
This is my first time dancing
in New York City,

551
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:02,950
so, you tell me.

552
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:05,748
Is it OK?

553
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,335
There's not much I can do about it,
so...

554
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,501
I'm sorry. You just...

555
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,591
caught me by surprise, is all.

556
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,348
I'm a by-the-book type. So...

557
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,051
By the book?

558
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,970
Try me again.

559
00:41:34,075 --> 00:41:38,444
María! María!

560
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:46,998
María!

561
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,671
María.

562
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,054
I'm glad to meet you, I'm...

563
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:03,510
What were you doing
under there with my sister?

564
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,685
- Bernardo, no!
- María!

565
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,060
I wasn't doing nothing.

566
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,391
Back up there, Bernardo.

567
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,226
You ought to know better.
Ain't you learned nothing?

568
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:13,194
I didn't mean no disrespect.

569
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,525
I just wanted to dance with her.

570
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,781
She don't wanna dance
with you, American.

571
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,404
Come on, we're all Americans, right?

572
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,326
Keep away from her, <i>hijo de puta!</i>

573
00:42:20,413 --> 00:42:21,995
Hey, hey! Now that
sounded kinda rough, Bernardo,

574
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,867
and I ain't having it.

575
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,198
Youse gonna fight or youse gonna dance?

576
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,958
I wanna dance, God damn it!

577
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:29,161
God damn it, Riff,

578
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,620
you swore to me
you wasn't starting nothing.

579
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:33,798
You promised me
that we could dance first

580
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,000
and then you was
only gonna challenge 'em...

581
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,176
I am here to dance, girly girl.

582
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,253
Ain't that what we been doin'?

583
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,337
Challenge who to what?

584
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,098
Like I know.
Like he tells me anything.

585
00:42:42,185 --> 00:42:43,596
María.

586
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,108
Thank you for the dance.

587
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,858
Sure. No, I mean, thank you
for the dance and for the...

588
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,109
<i>Ay...</i>

589
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,156
Let's say...

590
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,072
Let's say we visit the head

591
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:03,699
and we'll pow-wow friendly like.

592
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,033
You, me,
and my troublemaking buddy here.

593
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,796
Do you wanna start World War III?

594
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:22,839
<i>Ay,</i> María, María.

595
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:27,059
Tony? Come on.

596
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,643
Tony, come on.

597
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:36,312
You walking away? Hey! Come on, man!

598
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:54,413
You want to fight, right?

599
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:57,499
Not here. We gotta set it up.

600
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:59,209
Set it up?

601
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,877
You mean like a date?

602
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:04,215
All of you, and all of us.

603
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,887
- We're busy guys.
- Mm-hmm.

604
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,185
We got jobs.

605
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:11,437
Why should we play on the playground

606
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:12,980
- with a bunch of...?
- Control of your territory,

607
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,148
that's what you get.

608
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,977
We keep clear out of your way,
you're Jet-free. If you win.

609
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,439
We win, you see us coming,
and we will keep coming,

610
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:23,275
you Sharks make like the rats
and skedaddle.

611
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,035
Where?

612
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:28,162
The river.

613
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,540
- The docks.
- The underpass.

614
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,663
- The rail yards.
- The salt shed.

615
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:33,743
<i>¿Dónde?</i>

616
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,875
<i>De dónde está</i> 57th and the river.

617
00:44:35,965 --> 00:44:36,955
Wait!

618
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,051
Midnight tomorrow.

619
00:44:48,019 --> 00:44:49,009
Weapons?

620
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,476
Fists.

621
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,770
Rocks.

622
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,396
- Bricks.
- Pipes.

623
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,723
- Chains.
- Knives?

624
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:56,808
Hey, we don't need no knives.

625
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:59,440
You boys love your knives.

626
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:03,656
Better without knives.

627
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,404
Better for who is the question
that comes to mind,

628
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,201
but no knives.

629
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:10,371
And no jazz till then. Copasetic?

630
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:25,007
Riff, I don't know, that about knives...

631
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,258
Them spics sleep

632
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:27,680
with their switchblades in their teeth.

633
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:28,848
- Action. Action.
- They ain't gonna leave

634
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,051
their knives at home.

635
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,431
Your friendly friend.

636
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,761
What about him?

637
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,267
I'll see him tomorrow night?

638
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,897
You bet your ass.

639
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,646
Tell him...

640
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,731
Tony.

641
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,772
Tell Tony

642
00:45:46,327 --> 00:45:47,692
I look forward to that.

643
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:19,940
María.

644
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:23,482
<i>The most beautiful sound</i>

645
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:27,031
<i>I ever heard</i>

646
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:28,987
<i>María</i>

647
00:46:29,078 --> 00:46:31,445
<i>María, María</i>

648
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:34,247
<i>María</i>

649
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:38,293
<i>All the beautiful sounds of the world</i>

650
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:41,371
<i>In a single word</i>

651
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:44,173
<i>María</i>

652
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,341
<i>María</i>

653
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,714
<i>María</i>

654
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,670
<i>María</i>

655
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:51,222
<i>María, María</i>

656
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:53,550
<i>María</i>

657
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:57,888
<i>I've just met a girl named María</i>

658
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:00,223
<i>And suddenly that name</i>

659
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:04,357
<i>Will never be the same to me</i>

660
00:47:04,739 --> 00:47:06,980
<i>María</i>

661
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:11,284
<i>I've just kissed a girl named María</i>

662
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:13,407
<i>And suddenly I've found</i>

663
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:17,411
<i>How wonderful a sound can be</i>

664
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,708
<i>María</i>

665
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:24,005
<i>Say it loud
And there's music playing</i>

666
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:25,753
<i>Say it soft</i>

667
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:29,302
<i>And it's almost like praying</i>

668
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,388
<i>María</i>

669
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:36,305
<i>I'll never stop saying</i>

670
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:41,227
<i>María</i>

671
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:43,729
<i>María</i>

672
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,102
<i>María</i>

673
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:50,899
<i>María, María</i>

674
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:56,242
<i>María</i>

675
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,824
<i>María</i>

676
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,909
<i>María</i>

677
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,789
<i>María</i>

678
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:05,129
<i>María</i>

679
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:10,006
<i>Say it loud and there's music playing</i>

680
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,507
<i>Say it soft</i>

681
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:15,135
<i>And it's almost like praying</i>

682
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:18,681
<i>María</i>

683
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:22,105
<i>I'll never stop saying</i>

684
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:30,030
<i>María</i>

685
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:38,535
<i>The most beautiful sound I ever heard</i>

686
00:48:39,125 --> 00:48:43,961
<i>María</i>

687
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:07,809
It's me!

688
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:09,940
Are you crazy? You can't...

689
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,021
What are you doing,
spooking around <i>como una rata?</i>

690
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,481
Come down.

691
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:14,657
- Meet me on the corner...
- No!

692
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,867
Let's meet on the, uh...

693
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,571
What's that mean?

694
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,494
It means "go away."

695
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,206
Can I come up?

696
00:49:27,173 --> 00:49:28,163
No.

697
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,331
- But I found you.
- Please.

698
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:33,088
My brother's so angry now,
he might...

699
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:35,170
I'll make him like me. Everybody does.

700
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:36,629
There's nobody who everybody likes.

701
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:40,800
Yeah, but, 50 long as you like me,

702
00:49:40,895 --> 00:49:42,385
I'm OK with that.

703
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,221
Please, you have to go.

704
00:49:47,193 --> 00:49:49,309
<i>Ay, Dios mío.</i> No, no, no.

705
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,907
María! We're home.

706
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:14,042
Need a little rum?
It'll help you sleep.

707
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,672
Who needs to sleep?

708
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:19,172
Oh, not here. In the bedroom.

709
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:37,899
<i>¿Dónde estás?</i>

710
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,233
Where are you? <i>Ay!</i>

711
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,447
Is it locked?

712
00:50:41,539 --> 00:50:43,371
<i>Sí,</i> but there's no key.

713
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,915
Well, that's against the law.
You ought to report that.

714
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,242
OK, I will. Now, please go,

715
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:49,372
or something bad will happen...

716
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,045
Run away with me.

717
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,166
I'm serious. Don't laugh.

718
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,422
<i>Sí,</i> serious.

719
00:50:56,512 --> 00:50:58,549
Maybe tomorrow I'll run away with you.

720
00:50:58,973 --> 00:51:00,384
Tomorrow?

721
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,549
Deal.

722
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:06,844
Wait!

723
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,315
Tomorrow, where?

724
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,442
I can't see ya.

725
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:26,364
Careful.

726
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,576
What's your name?

727
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,127
Tony.

728
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,875
See you tomorrow, Tony.

729
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:35,832
- You promise me?
- What?

730
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,798
You gotta see me tomorrow. Nobody else.

731
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,218
Only me.

732
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,344
<i>Only you</i>

733
00:51:48,439 --> 00:51:53,354
<i>You're the only thing I'll see forever</i>

734
00:51:53,444 --> 00:51:55,685
<i>In my eyes, in my words</i>

735
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,567
<i>And in everything I do</i>

736
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:02,321
<i>Nothing else but you
Ever</i>

737
00:52:02,411 --> 00:52:06,871
<i>And there's nothing for me but María</i>

738
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:12,168
<i>Every sight that I see is María</i>

739
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:15,042
<i>Tony, Tony</i>

740
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:19,342
<i>Always you
Every thought I'll ever know</i>

741
00:52:19,428 --> 00:52:21,339
<i>Everywhere I go</i>

742
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,171
<i>- You'll be
- All the world is only</i>

743
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:27,259
<i>You and me</i>

744
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:36,225
<i>Tonight, tonight</i>

745
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,778
<i>It all began tonight</i>

746
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:44,276
<i>I saw you and the world went away</i>

747
00:52:45,454 --> 00:52:48,321
<i>Tonight, tonight</i>

748
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:51,077
<i>There's only you tonight</i>

749
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:54,081
<i>What you are
What you do</i>

750
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,629
<i>What you say</i>

751
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:01,793
<i>Today, all day
I had the feeling</i>

752
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,012
<i>A miracle would happen</i>

753
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:09,639
<i>I know now I was right</i>

754
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,561
<i>For here you are</i>

755
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:18,269
<i>And what was just a world
Is a star</i>

756
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:23,152
<i>Tonight</i>

757
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:34,576
<i>Tonight</i>

758
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,287
<i>Tonight</i>

759
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:43,297
<i>The world is full of light</i>

760
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:49,474
<i>With suns and moons all over the place</i>

761
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,760
<i>Tonight, tonight</i>

762
00:53:52,855 --> 00:53:55,347
<i>The world is wild and bright</i>

763
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:57,147
<i>Going mad</i>

764
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:01,353
<i>Shooting sparks into space</i>

765
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:06,737
<i>Today the world was just an address</i>

766
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:09,865
<i>A place for me to live in</i>

767
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:14,119
<i>No better than alright</i>

768
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:17,410
<i>But here you are</i>

769
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,791
<i>And what was just a world</i>

770
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:23,000
<i>Is a star</i>

771
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:27,963
<i>Tonight</i>

772
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,771
María!

773
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:43,652
Tomorrow.

774
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:45,150
Tomorrow.

775
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,275
<i>Sí.</i>

776
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:51,865
Wait! What time?

777
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:54,955
Uh, tomorrow night?

778
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,032
I work.

779
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:59,540
2:00? PM?

780
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:04,503
72nd Street subway station. Uptown side.

781
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:06,755
<i>Sí. Sí,</i> OK. Now...

782
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,678
Wait! Wait!

783
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,399
I forgot why I called you.

784
00:55:30,494 --> 00:55:32,485
I'll wait till you remember.

785
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:36,114
Tony is Antonio?

786
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:37,494
Anton.

787
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:42,002
<i>Te adoro,</i> Anton.

788
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,498
<i>Te adoro,</i> María.

789
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:52,054
<i>Good night</i>

790
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,383
<i>Good night</i>

791
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,718
<i>Sleep well</i>

792
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:01,181
<i>And when you dream</i>

793
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:06,270
<i>Dream of me</i>

794
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:13,694
<i>Tonight</i>

795
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,823
María! Breakfast, <i>niña.</i>

796
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,213
Last night I dreamed
I was back in Puerto Rico.

797
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:41,048
In my dream, we had six kids.

798
00:58:41,143 --> 00:58:43,931
Six kids? Marry a cat.

799
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:45,603
I've been asking you for five years.

800
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:46,975
Mm-hmm.

801
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:50,933
You want to marry me,
then leave the gringos alone.

802
00:58:52,279 --> 00:58:54,361
I'm gonna make
quick work of the Jets.

803
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,155
You sound like the funny papers.

804
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,027
"The Jets."

805
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,611
English. We gotta practice.

806
00:59:02,998 --> 00:59:05,865
- Anita María Teresa...
- Oh.

807
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:10,711
Josefina...

808
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:13,964
Good morning.

809
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:17,793
I'm right here.

810
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,725
Stay here and don't fight?

811
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,302
What fight?

812
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:29,058
Don't worry about that.

813
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:32,604
You don't have a fight till next week.

814
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:34,605
The match with that Thompson guy.

815
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:35,936
What was his name?

816
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:38,648
Your brother has something
to say to you.

817
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,153
I apologise

818
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,201
for behaving last night like a...

819
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,904
Like a gangster.

820
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,371
It was embarrassing.

821
00:59:50,462 --> 00:59:51,873
And he's apologising.

822
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:54,880
<i>Perdón.</i>

823
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,548
I'm a grown-up now, Bernardo.

824
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,000
I can dance with anyone I like.

825
00:59:58,095 --> 00:59:59,881
As long as he's <i>puertorriqueño.</i>

826
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:02,133
But why? Tony's a nice boy.

827
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:05,182
Tony?

828
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:08,348
Tony. Who cares if he's a...?

829
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,729
I don't know what he is. A Yankee?

830
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:13,433
He's a Polack. That's what he is.

831
01:00:13,527 --> 01:00:16,110
A big, dumb Polack.

832
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:18,483
"Polack," says the spic.

833
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:21,156
Now you sound like a real American.

834
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,536
I don't want you to marry a gringo.

835
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:28,952
Marry him?

836
01:00:29,668 --> 01:00:32,330
I danced with him, Bernardo.

837
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,706
For a minute, until you...

838
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,918
You're crazy.
I can't talk to you anymore.

839
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:40,630
I was OK on my own.

840
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,428
Just me and <i>Papi</i>
for five years without you,

841
01:00:43,515 --> 01:00:44,926
while you came here,

842
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:46,882
where you do everything you want.

843
01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:49,765
You... You study, and you make money...

844
01:00:49,855 --> 01:00:51,095
And he boxes.

845
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:52,850
<i>Sí.</i> And you have your boxing.

846
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:54,898
And he fights in the streets.

847
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,817
Don't fight with the Jets.

848
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:00,520
I want you to be happy.

849
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:01,946
Mm.

850
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,274
Here, dead man, eat your eggs.

851
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:07,157
And everyone, speak English.

852
01:01:07,247 --> 01:01:08,578
But I'm here, too.

853
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,327
And I... I want to make a life, a home.

854
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:12,624
Maybe go to City College

855
01:01:12,711 --> 01:01:15,123
like Rosalía's cousin, Virginia.

856
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:16,499
I want to be happy here.

857
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,915
English.

858
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:21,626
Puerto Rico, <i>sí.</i>

859
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,506
That is what you think.

860
01:01:23,597 --> 01:01:26,385
- I'm gonna think for myself.
- You keep away from him.

861
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:30,726
As long as you're in my house...

862
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:32,769
This ain't your house.

863
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:35,518
She pays rent here
same as me and you.

864
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:37,145
This is about family.

865
01:01:41,573 --> 01:01:43,735
Ah!

866
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,701
María...

867
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:00,669
Maybe Chino and your friends
fall down at your feet,

868
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:02,375
and maybe you scare the <i>Americanos</i>

869
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:04,460
when you make fists and angry faces...

870
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:16,438
And I am not interested
in what you have to say.

871
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:35,415
You want to know where my home is?

872
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:38,164
It's where I pay rent. Right here,

873
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:40,746
where I work my fingers raw,

874
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,922
mending pants and hemming neckties

875
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,875
so that I can earn enough money

876
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,756
to pay other girls to sew for me,

877
01:02:46,846 --> 01:02:50,214
so that someday
I can rent a shop of my own

878
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:53,050
in this great, big,
beautiful <i>Nueva York.</i>

879
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:54,134
Ah.

880
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,772
And if you think

881
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,395
that I'm going back home
to Puerto Rico with six kids

882
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,602
that I put to bed hungry every night,

883
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:06,947
<i>amor de mi vida,</i> you are dreaming.

884
01:03:10,662 --> 01:03:12,903
In Puerto Rico, our kids won't get fat

885
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:14,204
like the kids in New York.

886
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:46,603
<i>Puerto Rico</i>

887
01:03:46,698 --> 01:03:49,486
<i>You lovely island</i>

888
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:54,036
<i>Island of tropical breezes</i>

889
01:03:55,373 --> 01:03:59,708
<i>Always the pineapples growing</i>

890
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:03,503
<i>Always the coffee blossoms blowing</i>

891
01:04:04,299 --> 01:04:06,631
<i>And the money owing</i>

892
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:10,177
<i>And the babies crying</i>

893
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,675
<i>And the people trying</i>

894
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:16,467
<i>I like the island Manhattan</i>

895
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:17,642
I know you do!

896
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:19,845
<i>Smoke on your pipe</i>

897
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,476
<i>And put that in</i>

898
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:32,532
<i>I like to be in America</i>

899
01:04:32,619 --> 01:04:34,735
<i>OK by me in America</i>

900

<i>Ay,</i> Tony,
you don't have enough troubles?

I don't wanna jinx it,

01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:22,481
but maybe I'm done with trouble.

959
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:25,863
You are never done with troubles. <i>Nunca.</i>

960
01:09:26,621 --> 01:09:28,737
- <i>Nunca. "Nunca"</i> means "never"?
- Uh-huh.

961
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:34,997
What's "forever"?

962
01:09:35,838 --> 01:09:39,047
Like, "I wanna be with you forever."

963
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,378
You don't wanna start, maybe,

964
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:43,756
with "I'd like to
take you out to coffee"?

965
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:45,883
No. Come on, tell me.

966
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:47,680

01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:52,351
This ain't casual like that.

969
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:53,473
Oh.

970
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:59,272
"I want to be with you forever."

971
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:10,862
"With you."

01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:12,243

I wanna show you something.

977
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,432
It's a surprise, uptown.

978
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:35,638
- You seem sorta...
- There's a fight tonight.

979
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:37,894
Between my brother and his friends.

980
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:40,066
- News to me.
- And your friend

981
01:10:40,153 --> 01:10:41,894
who helped you when Bernardo...

982
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:43,478
Riff.

983
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:47,316
Tell him, Riff, tell him not to.

984
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:49,867
It's because of us
they're gonna fight, <i>verdad?</i>

985
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:52,070
Well, get your brother to call it off.

986
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:53,451
Bernardo's too angry.

987
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,990
Well, Riff's angry, too, so...

988
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,951
Come on.

989
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:15,260
This place we're going,
it's, uh, up past Harlem.

990
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,141
It's practically
at the tip of the island.

991
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:19,643
My brother...

992
01:11:20,401 --> 01:11:23,484
there's so much more
against him than Riff.

993
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:24,686
He's angry because...

994
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:26,772
The whole world has been against Riff

995
01:11:26,866 --> 01:11:27,981
since he was born.

996
01:11:29,786 --> 01:11:32,278
Do you think it's easier for us?

997
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,869
Uh, well, I think you come
from families, homes.

998
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,324
You and Bernardo, you have hope.

999
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:39,830
You think Riff has that?

1000
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:41,787
Riff could have hope
if he didn't try to take hope

1001
01:11:41,881 --> 01:11:42,962
from people he doesn't know.

1002
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:45,006
Riff didn't start this, it was Bernardo.

1003
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:46,423
He came after me.

1004
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:48,047
Just cause I wanted to dance with you.

1005
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:50,424
Tony, if someone gets hurt
because of what we do...

1006
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:52,802
What did we do to anyone?

1007
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:56,385
We don't do anything wrong,
liking each other,

1008
01:11:56,479 --> 01:11:57,844
- <i>pero...</i>
- María.

1009
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:01,514
I don't just like you.

1010
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:10,273
We can't pretend what we do
doesn't cause trouble.

1011
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:16,246
I can't talk my guys
outta making trouble.

1012
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,491
Trouble's what they're made of.

1013
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:38,518
All of you go suck a pickle.

1014
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:40,937
You think we're going to jail?

1015
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,981
They're fishing, is all.
Asking questions.

1016
01:12:44,068 --> 01:12:47,106
Which we ain't answering.

1017
01:12:47,196 --> 01:12:49,107
So, you're gonna tell me

1018
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,939
where and when the rumble's happening...

1019
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:53,404
or I'm gonna send you
straight to the Tombs.

1020
01:12:53,494 --> 01:12:56,077
I don't know where the rumble is.

1021
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:58,738
I don't even know what a rumble is.

1022
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:03,038
Uh, they don't tell me nothing.

1023
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:04,836
They know I can't keep any secrets.

1024
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:06,458
They tell you when to show up, right?

1025
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:08,039
Nah, they don't.

1026
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:11,502
I just hang around
until somebody says "let's go."

1027
01:13:12,305 --> 01:13:13,420
And then?

1028
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:16,464
I go.

1029
01:13:21,022 --> 01:13:22,387
I can't go to jail, Deez.

1030
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:24,813
Dry up, weepy, or else go sit
on the ladies' bench

1031
01:13:24,901 --> 01:13:26,187
with the other dickless wonder.

1032
01:13:26,277 --> 01:13:28,109
- Leave her be.
- Get stuffed, why don't ya?

1033
01:13:28,195 --> 01:13:29,981
Go back to the zoo, why don't ya?

1034
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:31,654
Go suck on your sister's titty,
why don't ya?

1035
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,072
You guinea hyena.

1036
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:35,609
Hey, Krupke! You made a mistake.

1037
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:37,410
She ain't a Jet.
She nags us all the time.

1038
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:38,861
Hey, I ought to be a Jet.
Tony told me...

1039
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:39,946
She ain't a Jet.

1040
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:41,247
- She ain't even a boy.
- Pipe down, A-Rab.

1041
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:42,699
- She's a dumb girl.
- I ain't a girl!

1042
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:44,784
She looks like some kinda
biological disaster,

1043
01:13:44,879 --> 01:13:47,871
but I pantsed her once,
and under oath, she's a girl!

1044
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:50,002
I said I ain't no goddamn girl,

1045
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,754
you shrivel-dick dago pansy!

1046
01:13:53,471 --> 01:13:55,712
Get off of him,

1047
01:13:58,684 --> 01:14:00,516
Cut it out! Now!

1048
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:04,187
You're gonna break her arm,
you godforsaken...

1049
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,763
I'm trying to get her off of him.

1050
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:09,104
Back up! God!

1051
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:11,106
My ulcer.

1052
01:14:15,785 --> 01:14:17,275
It's a freaking felony!

1053
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:19,361
Assaulting an officer of the...

1054
01:14:21,165 --> 01:14:22,155
Sit yourselves some place

1055
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:24,160
and don't move a muscle till I get back!

1056
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:26,413
Don't even sweat! Youse hear me?

1057
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:33,541
Hey, a girl gave me a nosebleed.

1058
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:35,126
She just bought herself a ticket

1059
01:14:35,221 --> 01:14:36,928
to the House of Detention.

1060
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:38,922
What about us?

1061
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,223
- Rikers, most likely.
- Rikers?

1062
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,267
What, you ain't
never been arrested before?

1063
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:45,391
He ain't never been nothing before.

1064
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:48,522
- That'd kill my ma.
- Oh.

1065
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,198
I can't go to jail.

1066
01:14:58,285 --> 01:15:00,902
You won't.
Long as you remember two things.

1067
01:15:00,997 --> 01:15:02,908
One, tell 'em what they wanna hear.

1068
01:15:02,999 --> 01:15:05,832
And two, don't tell 'em nothing.

1069
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:07,583
Hey, garbage!

1070
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:10,412
Who?

1071
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,043
Me, Officer Krupke?

1072
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:14,169
Well, look at youse.

1073
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,797
You feckless frigging disappointments.

1074
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,218
Now, give me one good reason

1075
01:15:18,305 --> 01:15:20,672
I shouldn't throw the book at ya.

1076
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:29,018
<i>Dear kindly Sergeant Krupke</i>

1077
01:15:29,108 --> 01:15:31,145
<i>You gotta understand</i>

1078
01:15:31,235 --> 01:15:32,771
<i>It's just our bringin' upke</i>

1079
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:34,569
<i>That gets us out of hand</i>

1080
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,271
<i>Our mothers all are junkies</i>

1081
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:38,527
<i>Our fathers all are drunks</i>

1082
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:41,493
<i>Golly Moses</i>

1083
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:43,536
<i>Naturally we're punks</i>

1084
01:15:44,415 --> 01:15:47,658
<i>Gee, Officer Krupke</i>

1085
01:15:47,752 --> 01:15:50,289
<i>We're very upset</i>

1086
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:54,418
<i>We never had the love
That every child ought to get</i>

1087
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:57,375
<i>We ain't no delinquents</i>

1088
01:15:57,470 --> 01:16:00,804
<i>We're misunderstood</i>

1089
01:16:00,890 --> 01:16:04,474
<i>Deep down inside us
There is good</i>

1090
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:06,802
<i>There is good</i>

1091
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,261
<i>There is good</i>

1092
01:16:08,355 --> 01:16:09,345
<i>There is good</i>

1093
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:12,523
<i>There is untapped good
Like inside</i>

1094
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:14,066
<i>The worst of us is good</i>

1095
01:16:14,153 --> 01:16:16,019
Aw, that's a touching good story.

1096
01:16:16,113 --> 01:16:17,569
Let me tell it to the world!

1097
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,567
Oh, just tell it to the judge.

1098
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:23,659
Whoo!

1099
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:29,365
Get over there.

1100
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,917
<i>Dear kindly Judge, Your Honour</i>

1101
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:35,213
<i>My parents treat me rough
With all their marijuana</i>

1102
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:36,881
<i>They won't give me a puff</i>

1103
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:40,426
<i>They didn't wanna have me
But somehow I was had</i>

1104
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:43,471
<i>Leapin' lizards
That's why I'm so bad</i>

1105
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:47,050
<i>Right! Officer Krupke
You're really a square</i>

1106
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:50,387
<i>This boy don't need a judge
He needs a analyst's care</i>

1107
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:53,940
<i>It's just his neurosis
That ought to be curbed</i>

1108
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,892
<i>He's psychologically disturbed</i>

1109
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:56,976
I'm disturbed!

1110
01:16:57,071 --> 01:16:58,607
<i>We're disturbed
We're disturbed</i>

1111
01:16:58,697 --> 01:17:00,233
<i>We're the most disturbed</i>

1112
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,941
<i>Like we're psychologically disturbed</i>

1113
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:13,288
Hear ye, hear ye.

1114
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,165
In the opinion of this court,
the boy's depraved

1115
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:16,872
on account of he ain't had
a normal home.

1116
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,832
Hey, I'm depraved
on account of I'm deprived!

1117
01:17:18,926 --> 01:17:20,337
So, take this nut to a headshrinker.

1118
01:17:20,427 --> 01:17:21,713
Oh, why not? Come on.

1119
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:23,545
Go, go, go.

1120
01:17:26,809 --> 01:17:30,677
<i>My father is a bastard
My ma's an S.O.B.</i>

1121
01:17:30,771 --> 01:17:34,014
<i>My grandpa's always plastered
My grandma pushes tea</i>

1122
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:37,976
<i>My sister wears a moustache
My brother wears a dress</i>

1123
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,356
<i>Goodness gracious</i>

1124
01:17:39,446 --> 01:17:41,153
- <i>That's why I'm a mess</i>
- Yes!

1125
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:44,073
<i>Officer Krupke
You're really a slob</i>

1126
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:47,369
<i>This boy don't need a doctor
Just a good honest job</i>

1127
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:51,072
<i>Society's played him a terrible trick</i>

1128
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:53,124
<i>And sociologically he's sick</i>

1129
01:17:53,210 --> 01:17:55,793
<i>- I am sick!
- We are sick, we are sick</i>

1130
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:57,370
<i>We are sick, sick, sick</i>

1131
01:17:57,464 --> 01:17:59,751
<i>Like we're sociologically sick</i>

1132
01:18:01,302 --> 01:18:03,384
I did it! Yeah!

1133
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:05,632
- Officer, I'm guilty.
- Get out of here.

1134
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,596
In my professional opinion,

1135
01:18:10,686 --> 01:18:11,676
what we got here

1136
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,011
is a run-of-the-mill
juvenile delinquent,

1137
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:17,269
and juvenile delinquency
is a social disease.

1138
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,941
Ew, Diesel, you got a social disease?

1139
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:20,610
Bring him to a social worker.

1140
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,778
Wait, can I catch it by touching him?

1141
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:26,274
Get down.

1142
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:27,950
Oh!

1143
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:29,653
<i>Dear</i>

1144
01:18:29,747 --> 01:18:31,237
<i>Kindly social worker</i>

1145
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:32,743
<i>They say go earn a buck</i>

1146
01:18:32,833 --> 01:18:34,494
<i>Like be a soda jerker</i>

1147
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:36,201
<i>Which means like be a schmuck</i>

1148
01:18:36,295 --> 01:18:39,754
<i>It's not I'm antisocial
I'm only anti-work</i>

1149
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,330
<i>Glory! Osky!</i>

1150
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:42,756
<i>That's why I'm a jerk</i>

1151
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:44,629
<i>Yee! Officer Krupke</i>

1152
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,302
<i>You've done it again</i>

1153
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,880
<i>This boy don't need a job
He needs a year in the pen</i>

1154
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:50,009
OK.

1155
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:53,218
<i>It ain't just a question
of misunderstood</i>

1156
01:18:53,312 --> 01:18:55,303
<i>Deep down inside him
He's no good</i>

1157
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:57,889
<i>- I'm no good
- We're no good, we're no good</i>

1158
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,519
<i>We're no earthly good</i>

1159
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:02,147
<i>Like the best of us is no damn good</i>

1160
01:19:04,698 --> 01:19:06,280
<i>The trouble is he's crazy</i>

1161
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:07,698
<i>The trouble is he drinks</i>

1162
01:19:07,785 --> 01:19:09,275
<i>The trouble is he's lazy</i>

1163
01:19:09,370 --> 01:19:10,826
<i>The trouble is he stinks</i>

1164
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:12,369
<i>The trouble is he's growin'</i>

1165
01:19:12,456 --> 01:19:14,322
<i>The trouble is he's grown</i>

1166
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:17,875
<i>Krupke, we've got troubles of our own</i>

1167
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:22,251
<i>Gee, Officer Krupke
We're down on our knees</i>

1168
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:26,300
<i>Cause no one wants a fellow
With a social disease</i>

1169
01:19:26,387 --> 01:19:32,633
<i>Gee, Officer Krupke
What are we to do?</i>

1170
01:19:32,726 --> 01:19:34,842
<i>Gee, Officer Krupke</i>

1171
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:36,518
<i>Krup you</i>

1172
01:19:55,082 --> 01:19:56,447
This is for you.

1173
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:05,505
This is the surprise.

1174
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:07,458
It look like a church.

1175
01:20:08,387 --> 01:20:10,424
It's a museum now, you know.

1176
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,356
First time I saw this place,

1177
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:29,109
I was on a prison bus.

1178
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:32,821
Up to the state prison in Ossining.

1179
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:40,624
There was a rumble.

1180
01:20:42,755 --> 01:20:44,712
And I busted up this kid.

1181
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:48,212
He was in the Egyptian Kings.

1182
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:53,425
He only didn't die because of luck,

1183
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:57,850
like, one more punch
and he probably would've died.

1184
01:20:57,936 --> 01:20:59,552
And I would've done it.

1185
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:01,725
I would've murdered this messed-up kid

1186
01:21:01,815 --> 01:21:03,772
who wasn't no different from me.

1187
01:21:04,902 --> 01:21:06,563
And for a year in prison
and since I got out,

1188
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:08,735
I can't quit thinking about
what I almost done.

1189
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:11,488
I think about killing him, and...

1190
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:13,316
and it's like I'm always
just about to fall off

1191
01:21:13,410 --> 01:21:16,027
the edge of
the world's tallest building.

1192
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:20,949
I stopped falling the second I saw you.

1193
01:21:45,401 --> 01:21:48,268
I shouldn't have asked you
to stop the fighting.

1194
01:21:50,406 --> 01:21:53,319
I don't want you to go
anywhere near the fighting.

1195
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:25,767
Don't laugh. It means I wanna be...

1196
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:27,974
I know what it means.

1197
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:56,134
I don't know what that...

1198
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:01,302
Oh.

1199
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:04,802
- Oh, that's...
- Don't laugh.

1200
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:12,147
I, Tony...

1201
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:15,321
I, Anton,

1202
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:18,816
take you, María,

1203
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,486
- rich or poor...
- I'm poor.

1204
01:23:22,581 --> 01:23:23,867
I'm poorer.

1205
01:23:34,343 --> 01:23:37,836
To love you and respect you.

1206
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:41,680
<i>Siempre.</i>

1207
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:50,348
<i>Make of our hands</i>

1208
01:23:50,442 --> 01:23:53,980
<i>One hand</i>

1209
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:57,814
<i>Make of our hearts</i>

1210
01:23:57,908 --> 01:24:01,071
<i>One heart</i>

1211
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:05,037
<i>Make of our vows</i>

1212
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:08,707
<i>One last vow</i>

1213
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:12,294
<i>Even death</i>

1214
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:17,342
<i>Won't part us now</i>

1215
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:21,091
<i>Make of our lives</i>

1216
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:24,469
<i>One life</i>

1217
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:28,144
<i>Day after day</i>

1218
01:24:28,230 --> 01:24:31,973
<i>One life</i>

1219
01:24:32,067 --> 01:24:35,605
<i>Now it begins</i>

1220
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:39,439
<i>Now we start</i>

1221
01:24:39,533 --> 01:24:42,901
<i>One hand</i>

1222
01:24:43,745 --> 01:24:47,955
<i>One heart</i>

1223
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:51,454
<i>Only death</i>

1224
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:58,383
<i>Will part us now</i>

1225
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:14,774
You're worried.
But they're still my guys.

1226
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:17,609
- They'll listen to me.
- But what if you can't?

1227
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,731
We can't be together

1228
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:20,904
while they're brawling all around us.

1229
01:25:20,991 --> 01:25:22,277
Because of us.

1230
01:25:23,994 --> 01:25:25,985
I swear to you, María,

1231
01:25:27,497 --> 01:25:29,488
there won't be any fight.

1232
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:35,874
<i>Make of our lives</i>

1233
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:39,502
<i>One life</i>

1234
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:43,052
<i>Day after day</i>

1235
01:25:43,138 --> 01:25:46,676
<i>One life</i>

1236
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:50,718
<i>Now it begins</i>

1237
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:54,476
<i>Now we start</i>

1238
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:58,059
<i>One hand</i>

1239
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:03,197
<i>One heart</i>

1240
01:26:03,283 --> 01:26:10,246
<i>- Death won't part
- Even death won't part</i>

1241
01:26:10,332 --> 01:26:17,170
<i>- Us now
- Us now</i>

1242
01:26:29,935 --> 01:26:31,642
Come see me tonight.

1243
01:26:42,322 --> 01:26:44,233
You ever fired a gun before?

1244
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:45,689
Sure, of course I have.

1245
01:26:45,784 --> 01:26:46,990
What kind?

1246
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:49,114
Colt. Revolver.

1247
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,741
That so? What'd it shoot?

1248
01:26:51,832 --> 01:26:53,197
Bullets.

1249
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,492
- .32s.
- Colt shoots .22s.

1250
01:26:59,256 --> 01:27:00,246
We got money.

1251
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,798
I don't sell heaters to unscrubbed boys.

1252
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:08,470
These guys,
the ones we're rumbling with,

1253
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:10,134
they're bringing heat.

1254
01:27:10,225 --> 01:27:11,431
Cause they think we're bringing heat.

1255
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:12,553
So, we need to bring heat

1256
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:15,102
so they know that we ain't defenceless.

1257
01:27:15,188 --> 01:27:16,804
And vice versa.

1258
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:20,562
Mutually assured destruction.

1259
01:27:21,528 --> 01:27:23,269
I don't know what that is.

1260
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:29,859
That's a Smith and Wesson, Model 10.

1261
01:27:31,538 --> 01:27:33,745
Classic of its kind.

1262
01:27:35,834 --> 01:27:39,327
If you want it, take it, why don't ya?

1263
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,711
Fires trey eights.

1264
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:53,299
Makes quite a hole for a little gun.

1265
01:27:54,436 --> 01:27:56,018
It's loaded.

1266
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:57,811
You don't gotta cock it, even.

1267
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:00,727
You just squeeze the trigger and...

1268
01:28:04,738 --> 01:28:06,320
You might as well.

1269
01:28:11,119 --> 01:28:13,702
You remind me of your dad.

1270
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,325
Leave it on the bar.

1271
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:22,623
What you got?

1272
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:24,330
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1273
01:28:24,424 --> 01:28:26,631
- Pow, pow, pow!
- Pow, pow, pow!

1274
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:28,584
- Eat lead!
- Pow, pow, pow!

1275
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:31,507
- Come on, you chicken!
- Pow, pow, pow!

1276
01:28:31,598 --> 01:28:33,214
Chicken, chicken, chicken!

1277
01:28:34,100 --> 01:28:35,181
Pow! Pow, pow!

1278
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:36,975
You yellow flatfoot, come on!

1279
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:38,177
Pow!

1280
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,266
Pow! Pow, pow!

1281
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:41,472
Pow.

1282
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:43,770
Gee whillikers, Batman.

1283
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,396
Since when you carry a rod?

1284
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:47,728
Well, I don't got magic powers
like you, Superman,

1285
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:48,984
so I got this.

1286
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:53,526
Promise to be with us tonight,
I'll let you hold it.

1287
01:28:54,371 --> 01:28:55,406
When are you gonna grow up?

1288
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:57,579
Never probably.
Born to die young, daddy-o.

1289
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,122
They catch you with this,

1290
01:28:59,209 --> 01:29:00,995
it's 15 years in Attica.

1291
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:02,872
- Call it off.
- Call what off?

1292
01:29:02,963 --> 01:29:05,421
Tell Bernardo the cops
found out about the rumble.

1293
01:29:05,507 --> 01:29:06,542
Tell him a rain check.

1294
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:08,089
Hey, why should we call it off?
We got a gun.

1295
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:09,632
Shut up, Tiger. Stay out of this.

1296
01:29:09,719 --> 01:29:11,710
You know we wouldn't even need
a gun if you was with us?

1297
01:29:11,805 --> 01:29:13,261
But you ain't, so let go
of my goddamn gun.

1298
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:14,338
I paid for it.

1299
01:29:14,432 --> 01:29:15,467
- You paid for it?
- Right.

1300
01:29:15,559 --> 01:29:16,549
Oh, OK, well, in that case,

1301
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:17,724
- oopsy-daisy.
- Tony. Tony.

1302
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:20,307
Tony! Tony!

1303
01:29:21,231 --> 01:29:22,721
Tony! Give me the gun!

1304
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:24,602
- Call off the rumble.
- Come on, it's mine.

1305
01:29:24,693 --> 01:29:25,683
It's yours?

1306
01:29:26,236 --> 01:29:29,399
Fellas, does it look to you
like this is his gun?

1307
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:33,319
Alright, let's get some beer
and some weed

1308
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:34,571
and let's go to the zoo.

1309
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:36,910
Like the old days, huh?

1310
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:39,739
Yeah. I will if you will.

1311
01:29:40,458 --> 01:29:42,415
You know me, brother. I don't look back.

1312
01:29:42,961 --> 01:29:44,372
Why? You afraid
of what you're gonna see?

1313
01:29:44,462 --> 01:29:45,452
No, I look ahead.

1314
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:47,379
I wanna be prepared
in case they come prepared.

1315
01:29:47,465 --> 01:29:49,877
So, give me the gun, Tony.
I mean it. Now.

1316
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:53,051
<i>Boy, boy, crazy boy</i>

1317
01:29:53,138 --> 01:29:55,470
<i>Get cool, boy</i>

1318
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:58,720
<i>Got a rocket in your pocket</i>

1319
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:01,598
- <i>Keep coolly cool, boy</i>
- Come on.

1320
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:02,769
<i>Don't get hot</i>

1321
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:06,975
<i>Cause, man, you've got
Some high times ahead</i>

1322
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:10,311
<i>Take it slow and daddy-o
You can five it up</i>

1323
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:12,772
- <i>And die in bed</i>
- Cut the crap!

1324
01:30:12,866 --> 01:30:15,824
<i>Boy, boy, crazy boy</i>

1325
01:30:15,911 --> 01:30:18,494
<i>Stay loose, boy</i>

1326
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:21,618
<i>Breeze it, buzz it
Easy does it</i>

1327
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:24,416
<i>Turn off the juice, boy</i>

1328
01:30:24,502 --> 01:30:25,537
<i>Go, man, go</i>

1329
01:30:25,629 --> 01:30:29,042
<i>But not like a yo-yo school boy</i>

1330
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:31,965
<i>Just play it cool, boy</i>

1331
01:30:32,052 --> 01:30:36,421
<i>Real cool</i>

1332
01:30:44,898 --> 01:30:46,013
Careful, buddy.

1333
01:30:57,535 --> 01:31:00,573
Careful yourself, Superman. Come on.

1334
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:15,777
- Cool!
- Go!

1335
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:17,820
- Crazy!
- Cool!

1336
01:32:17,907 --> 01:32:19,068
- Go!
- Crazy!

1337
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:20,149
Go!

1338
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:29,996
- Come on!
- Tony!

1339
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:33,454
I'm open!

1340
01:32:34,257 --> 01:32:35,543
Tiger, toss it!

1341
01:32:36,301 --> 01:32:37,541
Come on, let's go!

1342
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:59,855
<i>Boy, boy, crazy boy</i>

1343
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:02,532
<i>Stay loose, boy</i>

1344
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:05,702
<i>Breeze it, buzz it
Easy does it</i>

1345
01:33:05,789 --> 01:33:08,326
<i>Turn off the juice, boy</i>

1346
01:33:13,213 --> 01:33:15,500
<i>Just play it cool, boy</i>

1347
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:18,711
<i>Real cool</i>

1348
01:33:22,639 --> 01:33:23,629
Pow.

1349
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:26,340
Pow.

1350
01:33:27,268 --> 01:33:28,474
Pow, pow!

1351
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:31,470
Pow.

1352
01:33:34,651 --> 01:33:35,641
Pow.

1353
01:33:39,072 --> 01:33:41,029
<i>It's happening tonight.</i>

1354
01:33:41,574 --> 01:33:43,360
That's all we know.

1355
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:46,819
The morning papers filled
with stories about dead kids.

1356
01:33:47,705 --> 01:33:49,662
Not on my watch.

1357
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:51,706
Every block of Lincoln Square,

1358
01:33:51,793 --> 01:33:54,751
every inch of San Juan Hill.

1359
01:33:57,132 --> 01:33:58,668
I want the West Side locked down.

1360
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:10,055
<i>The Jets are gonna
Have their day tonight</i>

1361
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:14,434
<i>The Jets are gonna
Have their way tonight</i>

1362
01:34:14,524 --> 01:34:17,141
<i>The Puerto Ricans grumble
"Fair fight"</i>

1363
01:34:17,235 --> 01:34:20,819
<i>But when they start a rumble
We'll rumble 'em right</i>

1364
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:26,113
<i>We're gonna hand 'em a surprise tonight</i>

1365
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:30,867
<i>We're gonna cut 'em down to size tonight</i>

1366
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:33,415
<i>We said, "OK, no rumpus
No tricks"</i>

1367
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:37,415
<i>But just in case they jump us
We're ready to mix</i>

1368
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:38,495
<i>Tonight!</i>

1369
01:34:39,632 --> 01:34:41,168
<i>We're gonna rock it tonight</i>

1370
01:34:41,259 --> 01:34:45,344
<i>We're gonna jazz it up
And have us a ball</i>

1371
01:34:45,722 --> 01:34:47,212
<i>They're gonna get it tonight</i>

1372
01:34:47,307 --> 01:34:51,642
<i>The more they turn it on
The harder they'll fall</i>

1373
01:34:51,728 --> 01:34:53,014
<i>Well, they began it</i>

1374
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:54,185
<i>Well, they began it</i>

1375
01:34:54,272 --> 01:34:57,560
<i>And we're the ones to stop 'em
Once and for all</i>

1376
01:34:57,650 --> 01:34:58,640
<i>Tonight!</i>

1377
01:35:05,909 --> 01:35:10,449
- <i>Anita's gonna get her kicks tonight</i>
- Ssh!

1378
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:14,827
<i>We'll have
our private little mix tonight</i>

1379
01:35:14,918 --> 01:35:17,751
<i>He'll walk in hot and tired
So what?</i>

1380
01:35:17,837 --> 01:35:20,750
<i>Don't matter if he's tired
As long as he's hot</i>

1381
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:22,539
- Shh!
- <i>Tonight</i>

1382
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:24,420
<i>Tonight, tonight</i>

1383
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:27,923
<i>Won't be just any night</i>

1384
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:33,430
<i>Tonight there will be no morning star</i>

1385
01:35:33,519 --> 01:35:37,012
<i>Tonight, tonight</i>

1386
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:39,689
<i>I'll see my love tonight</i>

1387
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:45,146
<i>And for us
Stars will stop where they are</i>

1388
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:50,701
<i>Today
The minutes seem like hours</i>

1389
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:53,745
<i>The hours go so slowly</i>

1390
01:35:53,831 --> 01:35:58,166
<i>And still the sky is light</i>

1391
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:01,211
<i>Oh, moon, grow bright</i>

1392
01:36:01,297 --> 01:36:03,959
<i>And make this endless day</i>

1393
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:07,884
<i>Endless night</i>

1394
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:19,438
<i>The Jets are comin' out on top tonight</i>

1395
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:23,942
<i>We're gonna watch Bernardo drop tonight</i>

1396
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:27,821
<i>That Puerto Rican punk'll go down</i>

1397
01:36:27,907 --> 01:36:31,275
<i>And when he's hollered uncle
We'll tear up the town</i>

1398
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:32,359
<i>Tonight, tonight</i>

1399
01:36:32,453 --> 01:36:33,488
<i>We'll be in back of you, boy</i>

1400
01:36:33,579 --> 01:36:35,411
<i>- Right
- Won't be just any night</i>

1401
01:36:35,498 --> 01:36:36,659
<i>We're gonna flatten him good</i>

1402
01:36:36,749 --> 01:36:37,739
<i>Right</i>

1403
01:36:37,834 --> 01:36:39,120
Womb to tomb?

1404
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:41,076
Sperm to worm!

1405
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:43,707
<i>And then we'll have us
A ball tonight</i>

1406
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:46,130
<i>- Tonight, tonight
- We're gonna rock it tonight</i>

1407
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:48,925
<i>- I'll see my love tonight
- We're gonna jazz it tonight</i>

1408
01:36:49,012 --> 01:36:52,755
<i>And for us
Stars will stop where they are</i>

1409
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:55,216
<i>We're gonna mix it tonight</i>

1410
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:59,099
<i>Today
The minutes seem like hours</i>

1411
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:02,101
<i>- They began it
- The hours go so slowly</i>

1412
01:37:02,191 --> 01:37:05,309
<i>- They began it
- And still the sky is light</i>

1413
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:06,939
<i>We'll stop 'em
Once and for all</i>

1414
01:37:07,030 --> 01:37:08,270
<i>We'll stop 'em
Once and for all</i>

1415
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:10,731
<i>Oh, moon, grow bright</i>

1416

<i>And make this endless day
Endless night</i>

1417
01:37:14,454 --> 01:37:16,616
<i>We're gonna rock it tonight</i>

1418
01:37:16,706 --> 01:37:23,624
<i>Tonight</i>

1419
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:07,629
Welcome to the North Pole.

1420
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:10,590
It's salt.

1421
01:38:10,927 --> 01:38:12,713
For when the streets ice up.

1422
01:38:16,349 --> 01:38:17,714
Kill the lights.

1423
01:39:14,365 --> 01:39:16,572
Promised your buddy
was gonna be here.

1424
01:39:16,951 --> 01:39:18,988
If you don't keep your word, <i>jefe,</i>

1425
01:39:19,078 --> 01:39:20,113
how am I going to believe

1426
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:22,366
you'll keep out
of our territory after...

1427
01:39:35,845 --> 01:39:38,177
And just when all hope is lost...

1428
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:46,641
So, is this the shot heard
round the world,

1429
01:39:46,731 --> 01:39:48,597
or just, you know,
more of your bullshit?

1430
01:39:48,691 --> 01:39:49,772
Don't ask me about shooting, pal.

1431
01:39:49,859 --> 01:39:50,940
You're the one with the gun.

1432
01:39:51,027 --> 01:39:53,439
That's right, and who are you?
Friend or foe?

1433
01:39:54,906 --> 01:39:56,442
- You're out of control.
- Hey.

1434
01:39:57,408 --> 01:39:59,274
I don't need it if you stand with us.

1435
01:39:59,368 --> 01:40:00,950
Here, take it.

1436
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:04,153
Go on, it'll be safe with you.

1437
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:05,910
And you pitch in.

1438
01:40:06,459 --> 01:40:07,540
I wanna talk to...

1439
01:40:07,627 --> 01:40:08,867
I'm doing the talking now.

1440
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:11,332
- Lets do it!
- Yeah!

1441
01:40:12,173 --> 01:40:14,164
Right now!

1442
01:40:17,386 --> 01:40:18,751
- Can I talk to you?
- Anything you need to say,

1443
01:40:18,846 --> 01:40:20,712
- you can say through me.
- We talked enough.

1444
01:40:20,806 --> 01:40:22,342
Let's try something else.

1445
01:40:22,850 --> 01:40:24,432
You and me,

1446
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:26,760
we just got off on the wrong foot,
is all.

1447
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:29,061
I always know which foot I'm on.

1448
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:33,395
We all know you can fight, Bernardo.

1449
01:40:33,486 --> 01:40:35,648
So, can you just quit dancing
for a second...

1450
01:40:35,738 --> 01:40:36,978
Yeah, can you quit
whispering in his ear?

1451
01:40:37,073 --> 01:40:39,110
...and listen to what
I came here to tell you?

1452
01:40:41,494 --> 01:40:43,326
I got nothing against you.

1453
01:40:43,996 --> 01:40:46,328
And... And if I, somehow or other,

1454
01:40:46,415 --> 01:40:48,031
if I offended you,

1455
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,542
I apologise.

1456
01:40:51,504 --> 01:40:53,415
<i>Oye, pana, I thought
we were going to fight.</i>

1457
01:40:55,174 --> 01:40:56,539
Did you bring him flowers, too?

1458
01:40:56,634 --> 01:40:58,796
Come on, quit flirting with him!
Close his eyes!

1459
01:40:58,886 --> 01:40:59,921
Hey, can't you shut up
for a single goddamn second?

1460
01:41:00,012 --> 01:41:01,502
What are you afraid of?
Your parole officer?

1461
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:03,383
You are breaking my heart
with this shit!

1462
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:05,590
- Come on!
- A convict?

1463
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:09,519
How long in prison?

1464
01:41:09,855 --> 01:41:11,721
Uh, a year.

1465
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:15,605
In prison, there were
Puerto Ricans, Dominicans?

1466
01:41:15,695 --> 01:41:19,154
Sure. Puerto Ricans,
Dominicans, Cubans.

1467
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:21,857
They love locking up
us brown guys.

1468
01:41:23,035 --> 01:41:26,073
This is not about skin.
It's... It's about...

1469
01:41:26,163 --> 01:41:27,449
It's about territory!

1470
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:29,281
That's right! Our territory!

1471
01:41:29,375 --> 01:41:33,118
None of us would be here
if any of us believed

1472
01:41:33,212 --> 01:41:35,249
we had any place else to be.

1473
01:41:36,299 --> 01:41:38,290
What did you do to get
yourself locked up, <i>primo?</i>

1474
01:41:38,384 --> 01:41:40,091
He beat the snot outta someone
exactly like you!

1475
01:41:40,177 --> 01:41:41,963
It don't matter what I did.

1476
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:45,638
I'm different now. And...

1477
01:41:47,018 --> 01:41:49,851
you don't gotta worry about me
being with María.

1478
01:41:52,565 --> 01:41:54,556
So, you told God and Jesús

1479
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:57,267
when you get out,
you gonna become somebody new?

1480
01:41:58,362 --> 01:42:00,353
Am I right, <i>pendejito?</i>

1481
01:42:03,034 --> 01:42:05,526
And then you came to that dance

1482
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,987
and you see my sister,

1483
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:10,242
and you think...

1484
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:14,875
"How about I get myself a brown girl?"

1485
01:42:17,757 --> 01:42:20,419
"I never spent time
with a little <i>puertorriqueña</i> before."

1486
01:42:20,885 --> 01:42:22,796
Tony!

1487
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:25,879
"If I can be
with a coloured girl like her,

1488
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:28,055
"I'll be somebody better than I was.

1489
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:31,009
"Somebody I never been before."

1490
01:42:32,146 --> 01:42:33,887
- Put your hands up!
- Come on! Hit him!

1491
01:42:33,981 --> 01:42:35,096
Come on!

1492
01:42:38,653 --> 01:42:40,985
He won't fight you,
fight someone who will.

1493
01:42:45,951 --> 01:42:47,692
I love her, Bernardo.

1494
01:42:54,919 --> 01:42:56,205
Stay out of this!

1495
01:43:38,379 --> 01:43:39,961
Finish it!

1496
01:43:40,047 --> 01:43:41,333
Tony!
What the hell are you doing?

1497
01:43:41,424 --> 01:43:42,414
Tony.

1498
01:43:42,508 --> 01:43:44,044
Come on.

1499
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:01,557
Fight me!

1500
01:44:05,489 --> 01:44:06,479
Riff...

1501
01:44:53,412 --> 01:44:55,073
- OK. That's enough.
- Tony! Tony! Tony!

1502
01:44:55,164 --> 01:44:56,620
Let go! Let go!

1503
01:45:18,646 --> 01:45:20,887
Its OK. Its OK.

1504
01:45:21,982 --> 01:45:22,972
Take it out.

1505
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,407
Tony, come on!

1506
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:17,242
Come on! Come on.

1507
01:46:18,038 --> 01:46:19,699
Tony, come on!

1508
01:46:27,006 --> 01:46:28,417
Tony, come on.

1509
01:47:00,956 --> 01:47:02,196
Housing Department.

1510
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:05,241
We're gonna get apartments
in the new buildings.

1511
01:47:07,046 --> 01:47:08,707
Right where we live now.

1512
01:47:08,797 --> 01:47:10,504
<i>Ay, nena,</i> we're gonna get evicted.

1513
01:47:12,384 --> 01:47:13,465
The new apartments,

1514
01:47:13,552 --> 01:47:15,714
the Metropolitan Opera,
the orchestra hall?

1515
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:18,512
Not for us, for the gringos.

1516
01:47:18,599 --> 01:47:20,761
That's why I cashed my relocation check

1517
01:47:20,851 --> 01:47:22,762
<i>inmediatamente.</i>

1518
01:47:22,853 --> 01:47:24,184
- Before they take it back.
- Mm-hmm.

1519
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:27,104
You cashed the check? I tore mine up.

1520
01:47:27,191 --> 01:47:30,229
- Uh-huh.
- You tore up a $500 check?

1521
01:47:31,946 --> 01:47:34,563
Once you cash the check,
<i>mi'jita,</i> they can evict you!

1522
01:47:34,657 --> 01:47:37,194
I mailed mine right back
to the Public Works.

1523
01:47:44,249 --> 01:47:45,580
<i>A ver,</i> Bernardo ain't keeping

1524
01:47:45,668 --> 01:47:47,705
their dirty money, <i>verdad,</i> María?

1525
01:47:48,128 --> 01:47:50,085
María?

1526
01:47:50,172 --> 01:47:51,333
Get down from there!

1527
01:47:53,801 --> 01:47:56,418
We have eight floors to clean! María!

1528
01:47:56,512 --> 01:47:58,344
Oh, I am terribly sorry, <i>Señora Fausta,</i>

1529
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:00,421
but I do not clean floors. No, no, no.

1530
01:48:00,516 --> 01:48:04,475
I wear my $17.98 silk shawl...

1531
01:48:04,561 --> 01:48:05,892
Ha-ha.

1532
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:07,015
Now get down.

1533
01:48:07,106 --> 01:48:09,097
She's dreaming about her boyfriend.

1534
01:48:09,191 --> 01:48:10,272
Oh, Chino.

1535
01:48:10,359 --> 01:48:12,817
Chino, <i>sí.</i> She's in love with Chino.

1536
01:48:14,697 --> 01:48:17,530
I'm happy in my fancy,

1537
01:48:17,616 --> 01:48:19,323
rich lady apartment.

1538
01:48:20,536 --> 01:48:23,995
<i>I feel pretty
Oh, so pretty</i>

1539
01:48:24,081 --> 01:48:27,449
<i>I feel pretty
And witty and bright</i>

1540
01:48:27,543 --> 01:48:29,159
<i>And I pity</i>

1541
01:48:29,253 --> 01:48:33,087
<i>Any girl who isn't me tonight</i>

1542
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:37,709
<i>I feel charming
Oh, so charming</i>

1543
01:48:37,803 --> 01:48:41,137
<i>It's alarming
How charming I feel</i>

1544
01:48:41,223 --> 01:48:42,839
<i>And so pretty</i>

1545
01:48:42,933 --> 01:48:46,767
<i>That I hardly can believe
I'm real</i>

1546
01:48:48,814 --> 01:48:51,397
<i>See that pretty girl
In that mirror there?</i>

1547
01:48:52,568 --> 01:48:55,105
<i>Who can that attractive girl be?</i>

1548
01:48:55,738 --> 01:48:57,604
<i>Such a pretty face
Such a pretty dress</i>

1549
01:48:57,698 --> 01:49:01,566
<i>Such a pretty smile
Such a pretty me</i>

1550
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:02,775
<i>I feel stunning</i>

1551
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:05,157
<i>And entrancing</i>

1552
01:49:05,247 --> 01:49:08,706
<i>Feel like running
And dancing for joy</i>

1553
01:49:08,792 --> 01:49:10,499
<i>For I'm loved</i>

1554
01:49:10,586 --> 01:49:15,126
<i>By a pretty wonderful boy</i>

1555
01:49:19,219 --> 01:49:22,587
<i>Have you met my good friend María?</i>

1556
01:49:22,681 --> 01:49:25,469
<i>The craziest girl on the block</i>

1557
01:49:26,018 --> 01:49:29,056
<i>You'll know her the minute you see her</i>

1558
01:49:29,146 --> 01:49:30,261
<i>She's the one</i>

1559
01:49:30,355 --> 01:49:32,596
<i>Who is in an advanced state of shock</i>

1560
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:36,650
<i>She thinks she's in love
She thinks she's in Spain</i>

1561
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:38,853
<i>Ay, she isn't in love</i>

1562
01:49:38,947 --> 01:49:40,904
<i>She's merely insane</i>

1563
01:49:41,533 --> 01:49:43,115
<i>It must be the heat</i>

1564
01:49:43,202 --> 01:49:45,239
<i>Or some rare disease</i>

1565
01:49:45,788 --> 01:49:47,449
<i>Or too much to eat</i>

1566
01:49:47,539 --> 01:49:50,406
<i>Or maybe it's fleas</i>

1567
01:49:50,501 --> 01:49:52,287
<i>Keep away from her</i>

1568
01:49:52,377 --> 01:49:54,038
<i>Send for Chino</i>

1569
01:49:54,129 --> 01:49:57,372
<i>This is not the María we know</i>

1570
01:49:57,466 --> 01:49:59,423
<i>- Modest and pure
- Polite</i>

1571
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:00,750
<i>And refined</i>

1572
01:50:01,136 --> 01:50:02,968
<i>Well-bred and mature</i>

1573
01:50:03,055 --> 01:50:04,841
<i>And out of her mind</i>

1574
01:50:07,476 --> 01:50:08,887
Miss America!

1575
01:50:08,977 --> 01:50:10,718
A speech, a speech, <i>por favor!</i>

1576
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:13,728
<i>I feel pretty</i>

1577
01:50:13,816 --> 01:50:15,557
<i>Oh so pretty</i>

1578
01:50:15,651 --> 01:50:18,985
<i>That the city should give me its key</i>

1579
01:50:19,071 --> 01:50:20,607
<i>A committee</i>

1580
01:50:20,697 --> 01:50:23,985
<i>Should be organized to honour me</i>

1581
01:50:25,869 --> 01:50:29,282
<i>I feel dizzy
I feel sunny</i>

1582
01:50:29,373 --> 01:50:32,616
<i>I feel fizzy and funny and fine</i>

1583
01:50:32,709 --> 01:50:34,416
<i>And so pretty</i>

1584
01:50:34,503 --> 01:50:37,962
<i>Miss America can just resign</i>

1585
01:50:38,048 --> 01:50:40,005
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la

1586
01:50:40,342 --> 01:50:42,549
<i>See that pretty girl
In that mirror there?</i>

1587
01:50:42,636 --> 01:50:43,967
<i>What mirror where?</i>

1588
01:50:44,054 --> 01:50:45,715
<i>Who can that attractive girl be?</i>

1589
01:50:45,806 --> 01:50:46,796
<i>- Which?
- What?</i>

1590
01:50:46,890 --> 01:50:47,880
<i>- Where?
- Who?</i>

1591
01:50:47,975 --> 01:50:49,181
<i>Such a pretty face
Such a pretty dress</i>

1592
01:50:49,268 --> 01:50:51,600
<i>Such a pretty smile
Such a pretty me</i>

1593
01:50:51,687 --> 01:50:53,303
<i>Such a pretty me</i>

1594
01:50:53,397 --> 01:50:54,933
<i>- I feel stunning
- I feel stunning</i>

1595
01:50:55,023 --> 01:50:56,934
<i>- And entrancing
- And entrancing</i>

1596
01:50:57,025 --> 01:51:00,143
<i>Feel like running and dancing for joy</i>

1597
01:51:00,237 --> 01:51:01,898
<i>For I'm loved</i>

1598
01:51:01,989 --> 01:51:06,028
<i>By a pretty wonderful boy</i>

1599
01:51:09,788 --> 01:51:11,404
Get back to work!

1600
01:51:22,259 --> 01:51:23,841
I didn't punch my time card.

1601
01:51:33,270 --> 01:51:34,681
<i>¿Hola?</i>

1602
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:42,310
Chino?

1603
01:51:46,366 --> 01:51:47,356
María.

1604
01:51:52,122 --> 01:51:53,453
<i>Que pasó?</i>

1605
01:51:55,918 --> 01:51:57,875
Chino, <i>que pasó?</i>

1606
01:52:08,680 --> 01:52:11,388
There was a fight <i>con los Jets.</i>

1607
01:52:16,980 --> 01:52:20,644
Like it was over
before anyone could stop him.

1608
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:28,439
And Riff, he got stabbed, and...

1609
01:52:28,533 --> 01:52:29,568
Tony.

1610
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:38,282
Chino!

1611
01:52:42,881 --> 01:52:44,872
Tony killed Bernardo.

1612
01:52:51,890 --> 01:52:54,177
Chino! Liar!

1613
01:52:55,769 --> 01:52:57,760
What's going on down there?

1614
01:53:54,411 --> 01:53:55,867
I... I didn't mean for it to...

1615
01:53:55,954 --> 01:53:58,070
You promised you would stop this.

1616
01:53:58,957 --> 01:54:00,823
You promised you would stop this!

1617
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:02,078
I tried. I tried.

1618
01:54:02,169 --> 01:54:04,627
And then you murdered him!
No, no, you murdered me!

1619
01:54:04,713 --> 01:54:06,875
You're a killer! The killer!

1620
01:54:06,965 --> 01:54:09,627
Killer, killer,
killer, killer, killer...

1621
01:54:20,395 --> 01:54:22,011
I'm going to the cops.

1622
01:54:27,235 --> 01:54:29,272
I just had to see you first.

1623
01:54:34,659 --> 01:54:37,242
If you let them take you from me,

1624
01:54:37,329 --> 01:54:39,741
how do I forgive you for that?

1625
01:55:02,479 --> 01:55:03,469
Go!

1626
01:55:03,563 --> 01:55:04,644
Come on!

1627
01:55:33,510 --> 01:55:35,000
Come on, we gotta get outta here.

1628
01:56:41,161 --> 01:56:45,405
<i>There's a place</i>

1629
01:56:45,499 --> 01:56:47,240
<i>For us</i>

1630
01:56:48,543 --> 01:56:50,910
<i>Somewhere</i>

1631
01:56:51,004 --> 01:56:54,167
<i>A place for us</i>

1632
01:56:55,091 --> 01:56:57,879
<i>Peace and quiet</i>

1633
01:56:57,969 --> 01:57:00,882
<i>And open air</i>

1634
01:57:01,640 --> 01:57:03,756
<i>Wait for us</i>

1635
01:57:04,559 --> 01:57:07,017
<i>Somewhere</i>

1636
01:57:08,647 --> 01:57:11,935
<i>There's a</i>

1637
01:57:12,025 --> 01:57:16,144
<i>Time for us</i>

1638
01:57:16,238 --> 01:57:18,525
<i>Someday</i>

1639
01:57:18,615 --> 01:57:22,074
<i>A time for us</i>

1640
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:24,993
<i>Time together</i>

1641
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:28,493
<i>With time to spare</i>

1642
01:57:28,583 --> 01:57:31,701
<i>Time to learn</i>

1643
01:57:31,795 --> 01:57:35,163
<i>Time to care</i>

1644
01:57:35,257 --> 01:57:38,249
<i>Someday</i>

1645
01:57:38,843 --> 01:57:42,632
<i>Somewhere</i>

1646
01:57:43,515 --> 01:57:49,636
<i>We'll find a new way of living</i>

1647
01:57:50,105 --> 01:57:55,191
<i>We'll find a way of forgiving</i>

1648
01:57:56,111 --> 01:58:01,652
<i>Somewhere</i>

1649
01:58:04,244 --> 01:58:07,703
<i>There's a</i>

1650
01:58:07,789 --> 01:58:11,327
<i>Place for us</i>

1651
01:58:12,168 --> 01:58:17,038
<i>A time and place for us</i>

1652
01:58:17,757 --> 01:58:20,374
<i>Hold my hand</i>

1653
01:58:20,468 --> 01:58:24,928
<i>And we're halfway there</i>

1654
01:58:25,015 --> 01:58:30,226
<i>Hold my hand
And I'll take you there</i>

1655
01:58:31,104 --> 01:58:33,721
<i>Somehow</i>

1656
01:58:35,358 --> 01:58:38,601
<i>Someday</i>

1657
01:58:41,072 --> 01:58:47,068
<i>Somewhere</i>

1658
01:59:18,610 --> 01:59:20,021
I should go.

1659
01:59:21,655 --> 01:59:23,020
Where?

1660
01:59:30,246 --> 01:59:31,782
<i>Ay, no.</i>

1661
01:59:40,882 --> 01:59:42,293
Go to Doc's.

1662
01:59:42,967 --> 01:59:44,378
Valentina will know what to do.

1663
01:59:45,512 --> 01:59:46,673
Tony!

1664
01:59:48,348 --> 01:59:49,964
Promise me you will.

1665
01:59:56,731 --> 01:59:58,017
María.

1666
02:00:19,212 --> 02:00:20,373
Come with me now.

1667
02:00:20,463 --> 02:00:22,124
I can't. I can't.

1668
02:00:24,134 --> 02:00:25,624
María.

1669
02:00:30,348 --> 02:00:32,305
<i>Sí,</i> I'm almost... I'll come out in a...

1670
02:00:38,356 --> 02:00:39,846
Go. Go.

1671
02:01:15,101 --> 02:01:16,842
I love him.

1672
02:01:21,733 --> 02:01:24,316
<i>A boy like that
Who'd kill your brother</i>

1673
02:01:24,402 --> 02:01:26,939
<i>Forget that boy and find another</i>

1674
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:31,399
<i>One of your own kind
Stick to your own kind</i>

1675
02:01:34,704 --> 02:01:37,162
<i>A boy like that will give you sorrow</i>

1676
02:01:37,248 --> 02:01:39,865
<i>You'll meet another boy tomorrow</i>

1677
02:01:39,959 --> 02:01:44,419
<i>One of your own kind
Stick to your own kind</i>

1678
02:01:45,381 --> 02:01:47,668
<i>A boy who kills cannot love</i>

1679
02:01:47,759 --> 02:01:50,296
<i>A boy who kills has no heart</i>

1680
02:01:50,386 --> 02:01:52,673
<i>And he's the boy who gets your love</i>

1681
02:01:52,764 --> 02:01:54,380
<i>And gets your heart</i>

1682
02:01:54,474 --> 02:01:57,091
<i>Very smart, María
Very smart</i>

1683
02:02:01,022 --> 02:02:03,605
<i>A boy like that wants one thing only</i>

1684
02:02:03,691 --> 02:02:06,274
<i>And when he's done
He'll leave you lonely</i>

1685
02:02:06,361 --> 02:02:09,524
<i>He'll murder your love
He murdered mine</i>

1686
02:02:09,614 --> 02:02:11,855
<i>Just wait and see
Just wait, María</i>

1687
02:02:11,950 --> 02:02:13,031
<i>Just wait and see</i>

1688
02:02:13,117 --> 02:02:15,779
<i>Oh, no, Anita, no</i>

1689
02:02:16,079 --> 02:02:19,197
<i>Anita, no</i>

1690
02:02:19,290 --> 02:02:21,406
<i>It isn't true
Not for me</i>

1691
02:02:21,501 --> 02:02:23,833
<i>It's true for you
Not for me</i>

1692
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:26,207
<i>I hear your words
And in my head</i>

1693
02:02:26,297 --> 02:02:29,790
<i>I know they're smart
But my heart, Anita</i>

1694
02:02:29,884 --> 02:02:31,170
<i>But my heart
Knows they're wrong</i>

1695
02:02:31,261 --> 02:02:32,501
<i>A boy like that
Who'd kill your brother</i>

1696
02:02:32,595 --> 02:02:33,676
<i>And my heart is too strong</i>

1697
02:02:33,763 --> 02:02:35,629
<i>Forget that boy and find another</i>

1698
02:02:35,723 --> 02:02:37,339
<i>- For I belong
- One of your own kind</i>

1699
02:02:37,433 --> 02:02:38,889
<i>Stick to your own kind</i>

1700
02:02:38,977 --> 02:02:42,060
<i>To him alone, to him alone
One thing I know</i>

1701
02:02:42,146 --> 02:02:44,934
<i>- A boy who kills cannot love
- I am his</i>

1702
02:02:45,024 --> 02:02:47,641
<i>- I don't care what he is
- A boy who kills has no heart</i>

1703
02:02:48,027 --> 02:02:49,483
<i>I don't know why it's so</i>

1704
02:02:49,571 --> 02:02:50,936
<i>And he's the boy
Who gets your love</i>

1705
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:53,067
<i>- I don't want to know
- And gets your heart</i>

1706
02:02:53,157 --> 02:02:55,148
<i>Very smart, María
Very smart</i>

1707
02:02:55,368 --> 02:02:58,281
<i>Oh, no, Anita, no</i>

1708
02:02:58,371 --> 02:03:00,453
<i>You should know better</i>

1709
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:03,077
<i>You were in love
Or so you said</i>

1710
02:03:03,918 --> 02:03:07,582
<i>You should know better</i>

1711
02:03:15,346 --> 02:03:20,432
<i>I have a love</i>

1712
02:03:20,518 --> 02:03:26,184
<i>And it's all that I have</i>

1713
02:03:26,983 --> 02:03:29,224
<i>Right or wrong</i>

1714
02:03:29,319 --> 02:03:33,688
<i>What else can I do?</i>

1715
02:03:34,532 --> 02:03:37,399
<i>I love him</i>

1716
02:03:37,994 --> 02:03:40,986
<i>I'm his</i>

1717
02:03:41,080 --> 02:03:46,575
<i>And everything he is</i>

1718
02:03:47,128 --> 02:03:52,123
<i>I am, too</i>

1719
02:03:54,093 --> 02:03:59,088
<i>I have a love</i>

1720
02:03:59,515 --> 02:04:05,227
<i>And it's all that I need</i>

1721
02:04:05,563 --> 02:04:08,021
<i>Right or wrong</i>

1722
02:04:08,107 --> 02:04:12,351
<i>And he needs me, too</i>

1723
02:04:13,196 --> 02:04:16,154
<i>I love him</i>

1724
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:18,777
<i>We're one</i>

1725
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:25,202
<i>There's nothing to be done</i>

1726
02:04:25,291 --> 02:04:30,127
<i>Not a thing I can do</i>

1727
02:04:31,506 --> 02:04:34,715
<i>But hold him</i>

1728
02:04:34,801 --> 02:04:40,467
<i>Hold him forever</i>

1729
02:04:41,057 --> 02:04:44,766
<i>Be with him now</i>

1730
02:04:44,852 --> 02:04:47,469
<i>Tomorrow</i>

1731
02:04:47,563 --> 02:04:51,648
<i>And all</i>

1732
02:04:51,734 --> 02:04:56,729
<i>Of my life</i>

1733
02:05:11,087 --> 02:05:16,878
<i>When love comes so strong</i>

1734
02:05:17,969 --> 02:05:23,430
<i>There is no right or wrong</i>

1735
02:05:24,267 --> 02:05:29,853
<i>Your love is</i>

1736
02:05:29,939 --> 02:05:34,934
<i>Your life</i>

1737
02:05:56,674 --> 02:05:59,041
He will never be safe here.

1738
02:06:00,428 --> 02:06:02,214
<i>Sí, lo sé.</i>

1739
02:06:02,305 --> 02:06:04,546
And no one will ever forgive him.

1740
02:06:06,851 --> 02:06:08,091
Will you?

1741
02:06:10,021 --> 02:06:12,308
You can't ever ask me that.

1742
02:06:14,567 --> 02:06:16,729
Will you forgive me?

1743
02:06:18,905 --> 02:06:23,365
<i>Te quiero, mi niña,</i>
but he will have to go away.

1744
02:06:24,285 --> 02:06:26,617
And you will have to go with him.

1745
02:06:59,737 --> 02:07:01,899
It got so bad so fast.

1746
02:07:08,621 --> 02:07:10,328
He was a hero.

1747
02:07:11,165 --> 02:07:13,202
I know people say that
about a lot of people...

1748
02:07:17,213 --> 02:07:19,124
Bernardo was a fool.

1749
02:07:20,258 --> 02:07:21,714
What did he die for?

1750
02:07:21,801 --> 02:07:24,133
<i>Murió luchando por su dignidad...</i>

1751
02:07:24,220 --> 02:07:28,464
and for pride, <i>mi hermano,
orgullo puertorriqueño!</i>

1752
02:07:28,558 --> 02:07:30,925
Bernardo, he died to show those gringos

1753
02:07:31,018 --> 02:07:32,554
how tough Puerto Ricans are.

1754
02:07:33,729 --> 02:07:35,515
And if they push us too far...

1755
02:07:35,606 --> 02:07:38,064
If those nobodies can take
your pride away from you,

1756
02:07:38,151 --> 02:07:39,607
<i>tú eres más estúpido que Bernardo.</i>

1757
02:07:48,661 --> 02:07:50,322
It's a big world.

1758
02:07:51,789 --> 02:07:55,407
Bernardo let the gringos tell him
there's only this <i>barrio,</i>

1759
02:07:55,501 --> 02:07:57,538
these 20 bad blocks.

1760
02:08:05,052 --> 02:08:07,134
Don't you do what Bernardo did.

1761
02:08:08,264 --> 02:08:10,756
You kill a gringo, they kill you.

1762
02:08:12,852 --> 02:08:16,140
Sooner or later,
the gringos kill everything.

1763
02:08:16,898 --> 02:08:18,980
Chino, Chino, Chino, <i>por favor.</i>

1764
02:08:26,365 --> 02:08:27,947
Don't follow me.

1765
02:08:37,710 --> 02:08:39,326
Bernardo was your husband?

1766
02:08:39,420 --> 02:08:40,410
Yes.

1767
02:08:40,963 --> 02:08:43,045
Oh. Close enough.

1768
02:08:44,383 --> 02:08:46,090
Your brother was angry
you danced with a white boy

1769
02:08:46,177 --> 02:08:47,588
at the mixer last night.

1770
02:08:48,137 --> 02:08:50,754
No. I don't think so.

1771
02:08:51,515 --> 02:08:53,722
You don't think the boy
you danced with was white?

1772
02:08:53,809 --> 02:08:56,016
Or you don't think Bernardo was angry?

1773
02:08:56,854 --> 02:08:59,061
I wouldn't dance with a white boy.

1774
02:08:59,148 --> 02:09:00,309
Yeah?

1775
02:09:01,317 --> 02:09:03,479
I heard you came with a date.

1776
02:09:03,569 --> 02:09:05,936
Some, uh, Puerto Rican boy.

1777
02:09:06,030 --> 02:09:08,818
Goes by the street name "Chino."

1778
02:09:11,744 --> 02:09:13,826
Word is, Chino's got a gun.

1779
02:09:18,334 --> 02:09:20,371
That's what the word is, anyway.

1780
02:09:22,088 --> 02:09:23,670
He's armed...

1781
02:09:23,756 --> 02:09:25,793
...and hunting
for this white stranger

1782
02:09:25,883 --> 02:09:27,419
who she danced with,

1783
02:09:27,510 --> 02:09:29,251
who we think killed your boyfriend!

1784
02:09:31,055 --> 02:09:32,921
Anything else you wanna add?

1785
02:09:34,225 --> 02:09:35,886
Bernardo told me about you.

1786
02:09:35,977 --> 02:09:36,967
I'm flattered.

1787
02:09:38,062 --> 02:09:39,848
The way you talked to him.

1788
02:09:46,112 --> 02:09:47,443
Chino is gentle.

1789
02:09:47,530 --> 02:09:49,191
He doesn't have a gun.

1790
02:09:49,282 --> 02:09:50,443
Apparently, now he does.

1791
02:09:56,163 --> 02:09:57,369
I have a, uh...

1792
02:09:58,666 --> 02:09:59,656
A headache?

1793
02:10:00,042 --> 02:10:01,703
She has her monthly, you know?

1794
02:10:01,877 --> 02:10:03,242
I get the picture.

1795
02:10:03,337 --> 02:10:05,203
I need for this, uh, medicine.

1796
02:10:05,298 --> 02:10:07,756
Anita, she can... she can go for me?

1797
02:10:08,509 --> 02:10:10,295
<i>Mamita...</i>

1798
02:10:12,930 --> 02:10:14,796
In English.

1799
02:10:17,143 --> 02:10:18,429
<i>Sí. Sí.</i>

1800
02:10:18,519 --> 02:10:20,226
English is hard to, uh...

1801
02:10:20,313 --> 02:10:21,895
Yeah, I bet it is.

1802
02:10:23,149 --> 02:10:25,186
She wants you to go to Doc's drugstore

1803
02:10:25,276 --> 02:10:26,892
and ask Valentina for...

1804
02:10:30,197 --> 02:10:32,313
Hot tea is how my wife handles it.

1805
02:10:33,617 --> 02:10:34,778
What did I say?

1806
02:10:34,869 --> 02:10:36,451
Tell Valentina,

1807
02:10:36,537 --> 02:10:40,030
I hope her cousin arrived safe
from Santurce.

1808
02:10:40,124 --> 02:10:43,082
And I'm sorry I can't be there
to meet him like I promised.

1809
02:10:43,169 --> 02:10:44,625
And all of a sudden, fluency.

1810
02:10:45,921 --> 02:10:47,787
That means "I'll come as soon as I can."

1811
02:10:47,882 --> 02:10:48,963
I can go?

1812
02:10:49,050 --> 02:10:50,882
You're not his widow or anything.

1813
02:10:50,968 --> 02:10:52,379
I'm done with you.

1814
02:11:19,914 --> 02:11:22,246
Must be tough, losing a brother.

1815
02:11:24,126 --> 02:11:27,084
So, let's start from the beginning.

1816
02:11:33,219 --> 02:11:34,675
I wanna go see him.

1817
02:11:35,679 --> 02:11:37,135
Talk to him.

1818
02:11:37,223 --> 02:11:38,713
Tony just wants to be alone right now,

1819
02:11:38,808 --> 02:11:40,014
he don't wanna see us.

1820
02:11:40,101 --> 02:11:41,091
He ain't alone.

1821
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:43,050
The old lady's down there with him.

1822
02:11:43,145 --> 02:11:45,557
Does he know we're up here?
Me and Grazie?

1823
02:11:45,981 --> 02:11:48,348
Does he know I'm here?

1824
02:11:49,485 --> 02:11:51,897
Tony cared about me once.

1825
02:11:51,987 --> 02:11:53,569
He don't wanna see you, Grazie.

1826
02:11:55,366 --> 02:11:56,902
Go home.

1827
02:11:57,535 --> 02:11:59,367
We left him lying there.

1828
02:12:01,163 --> 02:12:02,653
In the salt shed.

1829
02:12:03,916 --> 02:12:05,031
Ice...

1830
02:12:06,168 --> 02:12:07,158
I know.

1831
02:12:07,253 --> 02:12:08,664
That's bothering me.

1832
02:12:09,880 --> 02:12:11,496
Bothers me, too, Deez.

1833
02:12:12,883 --> 02:12:14,465
He ain't there anymore.

1834
02:12:14,552 --> 02:12:15,792
Jesus Christ.

1835
02:12:15,886 --> 02:12:16,921
Where'd you come from?

1836
02:12:17,096 --> 02:12:19,007
Down the chimney like Santy Claus.

1837
02:12:19,098 --> 02:12:20,088
What's Tony gonna do?

1838
02:12:21,267 --> 02:12:23,258
Go pop yourself, ya blister.

1839
02:12:23,978 --> 02:12:26,595
How long's he figure
on holing up down there?

1840
02:12:26,689 --> 02:12:27,929
Till the heat dies down.

1841
02:12:28,107 --> 02:12:29,597
When's that gonna happen?

1842
02:12:31,652 --> 02:12:33,768
Two guys died, so...

1843
02:12:34,363 --> 02:12:35,398
never ever,

1844
02:12:44,999 --> 02:12:47,115
Bernardo's friend, Chino?

1845
02:12:49,295 --> 02:12:51,206
He has Riff's gun.

1846
02:12:52,631 --> 02:12:54,247
Oh, Jesus.

1847
02:12:54,341 --> 02:12:56,173
And he's hunting for Tony.

1848
02:12:57,303 --> 02:12:58,885
What are we gonna do?

1849
02:12:59,555 --> 02:13:00,886
I don't know.

1850
02:13:03,267 --> 02:13:04,507
Where you going?

1851
02:13:05,102 --> 02:13:06,638
To keep track of Chino.

1852
02:13:07,271 --> 02:13:09,137
Yeah, yeah. Good. You do that.

1853
02:13:09,773 --> 02:13:10,979
In and out of shadows.

1854
02:13:11,066 --> 02:13:12,181
That's how.

1855
02:13:12,860 --> 02:13:13,941
Hey.

1856
02:13:19,241 --> 02:13:20,481
You done good, buddy boy.

1857
02:13:34,006 --> 02:13:35,337
Leave.

1858
02:13:49,939 --> 02:13:52,476
I want to see your friend, Tony.

1859
02:13:52,566 --> 02:13:55,228
He's here? He's supposed to be.

1860
02:13:59,406 --> 02:14:01,522
I have a message for him.

1861
02:14:11,043 --> 02:14:12,374
Where is Valentina?

1862
02:14:12,878 --> 02:14:14,494
You're Bernardo's girl.

1863
02:14:14,588 --> 02:14:16,044
We saw you at the gym.

1864
02:14:16,423 --> 02:14:18,380
Yeah, you wanna dance, Chiquita Banana?

1865
02:14:18,467 --> 02:14:20,799
Dancing up a storm, you was,
dipping them hips.

1866
02:14:21,011 --> 02:14:22,001
Valentina!

1867
02:14:26,433 --> 02:14:27,639
Spanish?

1868
02:14:27,726 --> 02:14:29,342
You come here speaking Spanish?

1869
02:14:29,436 --> 02:14:30,676
I wasn't talking to you.

1870
02:14:30,771 --> 02:14:33,308
No Spanish. Not with us. Not today.

1871
02:14:42,324 --> 02:14:43,530
Let me pass.

1872
02:14:43,617 --> 02:14:45,107
You heard her, boys.

1873
02:14:46,161 --> 02:14:47,242
She wants to pass.

1874
02:14:47,329 --> 02:14:48,990
Hmm, she's too dark to pass.

1875
02:14:49,957 --> 02:14:51,243
Let her go.

1876
02:14:51,875 --> 02:14:53,741
No one wants you here.

1877
02:14:55,337 --> 02:14:57,578
Why don't you dance for us first?

1878
02:15:04,555 --> 02:15:07,673
Dance with me, darling,
like you danced at the gym.

1879
02:15:07,766 --> 02:15:09,427
Numbers, stop it.

1880
02:15:10,019 --> 02:15:11,350
Stop it.

1881
02:15:11,437 --> 02:15:12,598
Cutting in.

1882
02:15:13,105 --> 02:15:14,095
Balkan, out of here.

1883
02:15:14,189 --> 02:15:15,475
Come on, you pig,
let's see you move!

1884
02:15:15,566 --> 02:15:16,681
No, no, no.

1885
02:15:17,484 --> 02:15:19,316
Bernardo's black pig.

1886
02:15:21,614 --> 02:15:23,605
Hey! Stop touching her!

1887
02:15:23,699 --> 02:15:25,110
Boys, don't do this!

1888
02:15:25,492 --> 02:15:27,108
- No!
- Tiger, let her go!

1889
02:15:27,703 --> 02:15:28,989
Let her go!

1890
02:15:29,079 --> 02:15:31,161
Ice, enough! Enough!

1891
02:15:32,041 --> 02:15:33,281
Help me!

1892
02:15:35,044 --> 02:15:36,159
No!

1893
02:15:37,254 --> 02:15:38,494
Don't hurt her!

1894
02:15:38,589 --> 02:15:39,750
Open the door!

1895
02:15:39,840 --> 02:15:40,875
Keep moving!

1896
02:15:40,966 --> 02:15:42,172
Don't hurt her!

1897
02:15:42,259 --> 02:15:44,091
Don't hurt her, please!

1898
02:15:46,555 --> 02:15:48,637
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1899
02:15:48,724 --> 02:15:50,761
What the hell are you doing?

1900
02:15:50,851 --> 02:15:53,218
You disgusting pieces of shit!

1901
02:15:56,273 --> 02:15:58,560
- <i>Mija, mija.</i>
- No!

1902
02:16:00,861 --> 02:16:02,226
Traitor!

1903
02:16:12,081 --> 02:16:13,867
Go back where you came from.

1904
02:16:21,090 --> 02:16:23,502
You think I want to stay here?

1905
02:16:23,592 --> 02:16:26,880
In this city full of ugly,
little animals like you?

1906
02:16:28,972 --> 02:16:30,133
<i>No, gracias.</i>

1907
02:16:44,446 --> 02:16:45,652
Tell Tony...

1908
02:16:46,907 --> 02:16:48,864
You tell that murderer...

1909
02:16:50,285 --> 02:16:52,242
María ain't coming.

1910
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:56,072
Chino, he found out about them...

1911
02:16:56,166 --> 02:16:57,748
Tony and María.

1912
02:17:03,173 --> 02:17:04,755
He shot her.

1913
02:17:05,759 --> 02:17:07,966
María is dead.

1914
02:17:10,639 --> 02:17:12,346
You tell him that.

1915
02:17:31,618 --> 02:17:33,200
I know you.

1916
02:17:34,913 --> 02:17:37,996
I know all of your names.

1917
02:17:39,376 --> 02:17:41,333
Since you was born.

1918
02:17:43,338 --> 02:17:45,204
I watched you grow up.

1919
02:17:46,925 --> 02:17:50,634
And you have grown into rapists.

1920
02:18:05,402 --> 02:18:07,609
You dishonour yourselves.

1921
02:18:09,782 --> 02:18:12,490
You dishonour your dead.

1922
02:18:19,500 --> 02:18:21,116
What do we do now?

1923
02:18:24,004 --> 02:18:25,290
We're done.

1924
02:18:45,651 --> 02:18:47,437
What was that? What was that?

1925
02:18:47,528 --> 02:18:48,734
You can never hear nothing
from down here.

1926
02:18:48,821 --> 02:18:49,982
- Was it the cops?
- No, no, no.

1927
02:18:50,072 --> 02:18:52,530
It was not police.
No, it was... it was...

1928
02:18:52,616 --> 02:18:54,857
Uh... Now it's alright.

1929
02:18:54,952 --> 02:18:57,239
Tony, let's sit down for a second, huh?

1930
02:18:57,329 --> 02:18:59,946
Listen. I got something to ask you.

1931
02:19:00,040 --> 02:19:01,781
No, no, wait. I... I...
I got something...

1932
02:19:01,875 --> 02:19:04,116
It ain't easy to ask this,
so let me just go, OK?

1933
02:19:04,211 --> 02:19:05,372
Wait, wait. I have something to...

1934
02:19:05,462 --> 02:19:07,294
You've given me so much already,

1935
02:19:07,381 --> 02:19:09,418
but when she gets here,

1936
02:19:09,508 --> 02:19:10,543
just...

1937
02:19:11,260 --> 02:19:13,592
If you could help us out
with the bus fare...

1938
02:19:13,679 --> 02:19:14,669
- Tony...
- I...

1939
02:19:14,763 --> 02:19:16,094
I have no idea what it's gonna cost

1940
02:19:16,181 --> 02:19:18,593
to get far enough away,
out west some place.

1941
02:19:18,684 --> 02:19:20,095
100 bucks for both of us.

1942
02:19:20,185 --> 02:19:23,018
And we'll get work when we get there.

1943
02:19:23,814 --> 02:19:26,146
We'll pay you back every cent.

1944
02:19:28,443 --> 02:19:30,480
I know you ain't got money,
so if it's too much to ask...

1945
02:19:30,571 --> 02:19:32,562
No, no, no. It's not too much.

1946
02:19:32,656 --> 02:19:34,693
It's not too much.

1947
02:19:36,285 --> 02:19:38,617
We're gonna name
all our girls Valentina.

1948
02:19:38,954 --> 02:19:40,444
- Hmm.
- Cause if you hadn't cared

1949
02:19:40,539 --> 02:19:41,779
for me like you always done,

1950
02:19:41,874 --> 02:19:44,241
I wouldn't even be here alive, which...

1951
02:19:44,793 --> 02:19:46,454
maybe I shouldn't be.

1952
02:19:46,545 --> 02:19:48,957
Don't ever say that, Tony.

1953
02:19:49,798 --> 02:19:52,756
Life matters even more than love.

1954
02:19:52,843 --> 02:19:54,880
Mm. They're the same thing.

1955
02:19:55,554 --> 02:19:58,967
Before María,
maybe I would've said they ain't.

1956
02:19:59,057 --> 02:20:01,845
But now, it's all life is.

1957
02:20:02,853 --> 02:20:05,140
Even if it lasts no time at all.

1958
02:20:05,230 --> 02:20:07,688
A month, a day even.

1959
02:20:08,275 --> 02:20:10,232
That was Anita upstairs.

1960
02:20:12,112 --> 02:20:13,352
What's wrong?

1961
02:20:14,323 --> 02:20:15,654
Chino...

1962
02:20:16,241 --> 02:20:17,356
What?

1963
02:20:18,035 --> 02:20:19,901
Chino has a gun.

1964
02:20:20,495 --> 02:20:21,576
He...

1965
02:20:22,122 --> 02:20:25,615
Chino shot María.

1966
02:20:29,463 --> 02:20:31,204
He killed her.

1967
02:20:31,882 --> 02:20:33,714
She's... She's dead.

1968
02:21:09,378 --> 02:21:10,789
Chino!

1969
02:21:11,755 --> 02:21:13,120
Chino!

1970
02:21:14,007 --> 02:21:15,418
Where are you?

1971
02:21:21,306 --> 02:21:22,888
Chino!

1972
02:21:25,102 --> 02:21:26,888
I'm right here!

1973
02:21:28,939 --> 02:21:30,521
Chino!

1974
02:21:31,108 --> 02:21:32,724
Chino!

1975
02:21:34,069 --> 02:21:35,651
Come on, man!

1976
02:21:35,737 --> 02:21:37,444
I'm right here!

1977
02:21:39,574 --> 02:21:41,360
I'm locking for you!

1978
02:21:41,451 --> 02:21:43,567
Come on! Come on, with me!

1979
02:21:43,954 --> 02:21:45,536
I know how to hide you.

1980
02:21:46,289 --> 02:21:47,825
I got places to go they'll never look,

1981
02:21:47,916 --> 02:21:49,122
just please!

1982
02:21:50,919 --> 02:21:52,535
Don't leave me here!

1983
02:21:54,631 --> 02:21:56,497
Get off of me!

1984
02:21:57,467 --> 02:21:59,504
Chino, kill me!

1985
02:21:59,594 --> 02:22:01,710
Kill me, too, Chino!

1986
02:22:09,187 --> 02:22:10,894
Chino!

1987
02:22:23,076 --> 02:22:24,066
No!

1988
02:22:25,203 --> 02:22:26,568
Don't!

1989
02:22:36,381 --> 02:22:38,713
<i>Mi amor mio, mi corazon.</i>

1990
02:22:40,385 --> 02:22:41,671
María.

1991
02:22:42,679 --> 02:22:43,965
María.

1992
02:22:49,394 --> 02:22:51,601
<i>Only you</i>

1993
02:22:53,648 --> 02:22:57,016
<i>You're the only thing I'll see</i>

1994
02:22:57,486 --> 02:22:59,318
<i>Forever</i>

1995
02:23:00,614 --> 02:23:02,946
<i>In my eyes, in my words</i>

1996
02:23:03,033 --> 02:23:05,400
<i>And in everything I do</i>

1997
02:23:06,369 --> 02:23:08,360
<i>Nothing else but you</i>

1998
02:23:09,414 --> 02:23:10,779
<i>Ever</i>

1999
02:23:55,919 --> 02:23:57,501
Give it to me.

2000
02:24:05,554 --> 02:24:07,340
How do you fire it?

2001
02:24:09,057 --> 02:24:11,264
Just pull this?

2002
02:24:14,020 --> 02:24:15,931
How many bullets are left?

2003
02:24:17,816 --> 02:24:19,306
Enough for you?

2004
02:24:22,946 --> 02:24:23,936
And you?

2005
02:24:26,032 --> 02:24:27,363
All of you!

2006
02:24:28,910 --> 02:24:31,902
I can kill now because I hate now.

2007
02:24:36,293 --> 02:24:37,829
I hate now.

2008
02:24:41,381 --> 02:24:43,497
How many can I kill, Chino?

2009
02:24:46,303 --> 02:24:48,886
And still have one bullet left for me!

2010
02:25:06,948 --> 02:25:08,438
<i>Te adoro,</i> Anton.

2011
02:25:12,662 --> 02:25:14,323
No, don't touch him!

2012
02:27:17,030 --> 02:27:22,030
