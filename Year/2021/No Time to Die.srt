00:00:58,425 --> 00:00:59,493
Madeleine?

3
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,146
You want to eat again?

4
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:06,941
You eat too much because you're depressed.

5
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:11,271
Madeleine!

6
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:12,697
Yes?

7
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,576
Madeleine!

8
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,952
Yes, mama?

9
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,205
I'm thirsty, my angel.

10
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:21,456
I'm coming.

11
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,251
- Do you want your medicine?
- Yes, my darling.

12
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,843
Do you want to play a game?

13
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,472
I'm waiting for Papa to come home.

14
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,019
What do you think Papa does?

15
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,979
He's a doctor.

16
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,024
He heals people.

17
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:49,964
Oh. No, no.

18
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:53,071
Your Papa, he kills people.

19
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:57,367
- No.
- Is that who you love? Murderers?

20
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:32,419
Mama.
Mama. Mama. Mama!

21
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,903
Leave me be. Go play.

22
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:36,423
Mama!

23
00:02:36,478 --> 00:02:37,407
Leave me alone!

24
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:03,618
Mama!

25
00:03:34,549 --> 00:03:39,319
- Is Mr. White home?
- No. He's gone.

26
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:43,124
My name
is Lyutsifer Safin.

27
00:03:43,157 --> 00:03:45,526
Your husband killed my family.

28
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,162
I told you, he's gone.

29
00:03:48,196 --> 00:03:51,566
I know.
This will hurt him more.

30
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:14,635
You okay?

31
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:17,972
Yes.

32
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,275
Let's go.

33
00:07:36,057 --> 00:07:37,058
How's the view?

34
00:07:38,793 --> 00:07:39,760
It's growing on me.

35
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:44,632
Can you go faster?

36
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,568
We don't need to go faster.

37
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,605
We have all the time
in the world.

38
00:08:33,881 --> 00:08:36,484
You can't help
looking over your shoulder.

39
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,253
- What?
- No one is coming.

40
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:41,622
I wasn't looking
over my shoulder.

41
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:42,923
- Yes, you were.
- No.

42
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:44,291
Are we gonna
have a row about this?

43
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:46,961
What are they burning?

44
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:50,464
Secrets. Wishes.
Letting go of the past.

45
00:08:50,498 --> 00:08:53,067
Getting rid of old things,
in come the new.

46
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:27,935
Where did you go to?

47
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,972
Today, by the water. Hmm?

48
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:33,374
Tell me.

49
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,912
I'll tell you
if you tell me about Vesper.

50
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:43,317
Is that why we're here?

51
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,752
She's buried at the acropolis.

52
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:46,020
I know where she's buried.

53
00:09:47,922 --> 00:09:51,358
Can you forgive her? For us?

54
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:55,863
I left her behind
a long time ago.

55
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,004
As long as we're looking
over our shoulder,

56
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:05,306
the past is not dead.

57
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:14,949
You have to let her go,
even if it's hard.

58
00:10:14,982 --> 00:10:17,918
You mean, um,
if we're to have a future?

59
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:19,220
Mm-hmm.

60
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:23,558
So, I do this, and then...

61
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:25,793
I'll tell you all my secrets.

62
00:10:28,896 --> 00:10:29,830
Okay.

63
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,469
I'm going to go
and do this,

64
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:44,205
and then I'm going
to come back for breakfast.

65
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:49,210
Thank you.

66
00:11:49,243 --> 00:11:52,012
And then you're going to tell
me where we're going next.

67
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,117
Home.

68
00:13:08,222 --> 00:13:09,758
I miss you.

69
00:14:08,616 --> 00:14:10,317
What...

70
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:24,965
Madeleine?

71
00:14:26,801 --> 00:14:27,669
Madeleine?

72
00:16:20,782 --> 00:16:22,316
Blofeld sends his regards.

73
00:16:23,918 --> 00:16:26,019
You know...

74
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:28,923
Madeleine,
she is a daughter of Spectre.

75
00:16:30,023 --> 00:16:33,360
She's a daughter of Spectre.

76
00:17:17,972 --> 00:17:19,974
Your baggage
is already down, Mr. Bond.

77
00:17:20,008 --> 00:17:21,676
As your wife requested.

78
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:29,851
You were right.

79
00:17:32,654 --> 00:17:34,856
Letting go is hard.

80
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:36,223
James.

81
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,892
What happened?

82
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:42,396
- What happened?
- How did they know I was here?

83
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:43,965
- What are you talking about?
- Madeleine,

84
00:17:43,998 --> 00:17:46,133
how did they know I was here?

85
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,468
- I have no idea what you're...
- Spectre. How did they know?

86
00:17:48,503 --> 00:17:50,404
What are you talking about?
James!

87
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,274
I didn't do anything.

88
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,679
I didn't do anything.

89
00:18:03,618 --> 00:18:05,385
We're leaving.

90
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,636
There is something
I need to tell you.

91
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,504
I bet there is.

92
00:18:28,743 --> 00:18:30,110
James!

93
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:53,601
Pick it up. Pick it up!

94
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,715
<i>It's Blofeld, my love.</i>

95
00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:09,784
<i>Your father
would be so proud of you.</i>

96
00:19:10,918 --> 00:19:13,353
<i>Your sacrifice
will be our glory.</i>

97
00:19:13,387 --> 00:19:15,288
- I don't understand.
- <i>Bravo.</i>

98
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,662
- Hello.
- Let the sheep out, kid.

99
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,248
- Why?
- Because otherwise I'll kill you.

100
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:32,140
James, why?
Why would I betray you?

101
00:19:32,172 --> 00:19:36,276
We all have our secrets,
we just didn't get to yours yet.

102
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:10,144
James. James, listen to me.

103
00:20:10,178 --> 00:20:11,546
I'd rather die
than you think I'm...

104
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:13,174
James!

105
00:21:14,976 --> 00:21:16,210
James!

106
00:21:16,244 --> 00:21:17,444
Do something. James!

107
00:21:20,248 --> 00:21:21,682
Say something, James!

108
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,786
Please.

109
00:21:35,563 --> 00:21:36,496
Okay.

110
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,821
Come on.

111
00:22:48,636 --> 00:22:52,405
So, this is it?

112
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,209
This is it.

113
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:05,820
How will I know
that you're okay?

114
00:23:07,188 --> 00:23:08,488
You won't.

115
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,125
You'll never see me again.

116
00:27:49,703 --> 00:27:51,272
We're in.

117
00:27:51,305 --> 00:27:52,673
<i>Proceed.</i>

118
00:27:54,643 --> 00:27:56,511
<i>Please</i>
<i>remember to back up</i>

119
00:27:56,545 --> 00:27:57,978
<i>all data by 10:00 p.m.
this evening</i>

120
00:27:58,012 --> 00:27:59,648
<i>due to planned
server maintenance.</i>

121
00:28:02,283 --> 00:28:04,018
You okay?

122
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:05,520
You know the, uh, SL5,

123
00:28:05,554 --> 00:28:07,955
the weaponized smallpox
I was using this morning?

124
00:28:07,988 --> 00:28:11,859
Have you seen it?
I... I put it in the bloody...

125
00:28:11,892 --> 00:28:14,061
Valdo, you haven't seen a tub
of smallpox, have you?

126
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:18,933
This was a good soup.

127
00:28:18,966 --> 00:28:22,336
Now it is waste,
even if it is joke.

128
00:28:23,904 --> 00:28:26,440
There is more complexity
in my tomato soup

129
00:28:26,473 --> 00:28:28,809
than in both
of your brains combined.

130
00:28:28,842 --> 00:28:31,680
Valdo, that is so unkind.
It's so...

131
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:34,549
One day
I will put Ebola in your tea.

132
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:38,018
And then I will watch
as your faces sweat blood...

133
00:28:38,052 --> 00:28:40,054
...and I will be laughing.

134
00:28:40,087 --> 00:28:42,323
- Nice. Keep your hair on.
- Wow.

135
00:28:42,356 --> 00:28:45,059
He's got a terrifying
imagination, hasn't he?

136
00:28:45,092 --> 00:28:46,661
Dr. Obruchev.

137
00:28:46,695 --> 00:28:48,062
<i>They are coming.</i>

138
00:28:48,095 --> 00:28:49,930
- Who?
- <i>Spectre.</i>

139
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:57,838
- Safin.
- <i>Do not try to stop them.</i>

140
00:28:57,871 --> 00:28:59,674
<i>This is what
we've been waiting for.</i>

141
00:29:02,776 --> 00:29:06,313
<i>They will ask you to enter
Bio Security Level Four fridge</i>

142
00:29:06,347 --> 00:29:08,082
<i>and remove the weapon.</i>

143
00:29:08,115 --> 00:29:11,418
<i>No one must see
what you are doing.</i>

144
00:29:11,452 --> 00:29:14,822
<i>They will not kill you.
They think they need you.</i>

145
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:18,359
They will not kill me?

146
00:29:18,392 --> 00:29:21,730
Transferring the files
as we speak.

147
00:29:21,762 --> 00:29:25,099
Now... Now it's done.
What do I do with it?

148
00:29:25,132 --> 00:29:26,735
<i>Swallow it. Goodbye.</i>

149
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:28,369
Swallow the...

150
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:32,707
Yes, I like animals!

151
00:29:32,741 --> 00:29:33,742
Bye-bye.

152
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,757
<i>Danger,</i>
<i>illegal access detected.</i>

153
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:51,325
<i>Secure all biohazardous

154
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:57,298
Move! Follow!

155
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:01,869
- No! No!
- <i>Caution.</i>

156
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:04,506
<i>Unauthorized personnel
located in this sector.</i>

157
00:30:14,649 --> 00:30:16,751
Please, we're
scientists, we're unarmed.

158
00:30:16,785 --> 00:30:18,118
We're unarmed.
What do you want?

159
00:30:20,755 --> 00:30:22,590
Valdo Obruchev.

160
00:30:22,624 --> 00:30:24,391
Hello.

161
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:26,795
Open the Bio Security
Level Four fridge.

162
00:30:28,362 --> 00:30:30,632
- And, uh...
- Give me the weapon.

163
00:30:30,665 --> 00:30:34,335
The weap... What weapon?
We have, uh...

164
00:30:35,135 --> 00:30:36,571
Heracles.

165
00:30:36,604 --> 00:30:38,740
It requires
double authentication.

166
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:39,774
Which one?

167
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:43,944
Him.

168
00:30:43,977 --> 00:30:46,080
Hardy. Hardy! Don't let them.

169
00:30:46,113 --> 00:30:48,516
Don't let them.
Don't let them, please.

170
00:31:32,426 --> 00:31:34,796
Oh.

171
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:36,631
<i>Warning,</i>

It's a safety belt? This?

177
00:31:57,117 --> 00:31:58,085
Wow.

178
00:32:14,301 --> 00:32:16,069
I... I cannot!

179
00:32:16,103 --> 00:32:18,238
There is no elevator!

180
00:32:23,977 --> 00:32:26,280
Magnets.

181
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:46,901
Sir, I've just received
the most unusual...

182
00:32:46,935 --> 00:32:48,068
I've seen it.

183
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:56,410
Oh, Jesus Christ.

184
00:33:00,414 --> 00:33:04,485
Sir, what's
the Heracles project?

185
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:07,154
This lab isn't on the books.

186
00:33:07,187 --> 00:33:08,155
No, it's not.

187
00:33:11,124 --> 00:33:12,927
- There were casualties.
- It was a gas leak.

188
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:15,329
Shall I alert the PM?

189
00:33:15,362 --> 00:33:16,931
It was a gas leak.
I'll handle it.

190
00:33:16,965 --> 00:33:17,966
Moneypenny.

191
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,536
Where's 007?

192
00:35:49,917 --> 00:35:51,719
Well,
isn't this a surprise, Felix?

193
00:35:51,753 --> 00:35:52,754
James.

194
00:35:54,122 --> 00:35:54,956
Who's the blond?

195
00:35:56,356 --> 00:35:58,993
Logan Ash, State Department.
It's really nice to meet you.

196
00:35:59,027 --> 00:36:03,397
I've heard a lot about you.
I mean, I'm a huge fan.

197
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:05,066
- Babylon.
- Police boy.

198
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:06,134
I need a favor, brother.

199
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,835
You didn't get the memo?
I'm retired.

200
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:09,269
I wouldn't ask
if you were still

201
00:36:09,302 --> 00:36:11,072
in Her Majesty's Service.

202
00:36:11,105 --> 00:36:12,507
And what does that mean?

203
00:36:13,941 --> 00:36:16,678
Our elected leaders aren't
playing nice in the sandbox.

204
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:20,682
James.

205
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:24,152
Is there somewhere quiet
where we can talk in private?

206
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:28,523
Quiet? Yeah.

207
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:32,794
I was hoping you
could pick up a package.

208
00:36:32,827 --> 00:36:34,062
- Five.
- Four.

209
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:37,497
Where's the package?

210
00:36:37,532 --> 00:36:39,366
Short trip. Cuba.

211
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:41,135
You love it there.

212
00:36:41,169 --> 00:36:43,004
Oh, I love it there?

213
00:36:43,037 --> 00:36:45,106
Hey. Valdo Obruchev.

214
00:36:45,139 --> 00:36:46,841
You're gonna say
you never heard of him.

215
00:36:46,874 --> 00:36:49,644
- Never heard of him. Two.
- Three.

216
00:36:49,677 --> 00:36:52,714
Ah... It's a good life.

217
00:36:52,747 --> 00:36:54,982
You never heard of him?

218
00:36:55,016 --> 00:36:57,217
Didn't he defect
during your tenure at MI6?

219
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,319
Obruchev was kidnapped
three days ago

220
00:36:59,352 --> 00:37:01,556
from a secret MI6 lab
in London.

221
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:04,324
Two days ago, his mug pinged
on a facial-recognition sweep

222
00:37:04,357 --> 00:37:06,728
in Santiago de Cuba.

223
00:37:06,761 --> 00:37:08,361
He's leaving out
the best part.

224
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:09,997
Spectre.

225
00:37:10,031 --> 00:37:12,934
I have a contact there,
says they're gathering.

226
00:37:14,068 --> 00:37:16,104
Coincidence?

227
00:37:17,572 --> 00:37:20,174
Come on.
It'll be like old times.

228
00:37:21,609 --> 00:37:22,577
- Three.
- Two.

229
00:37:26,714 --> 00:37:28,549
You're really
the only guy for the job.

230
00:37:29,951 --> 00:37:32,754
- You're the guy.
- It's my round.

231
00:37:41,229 --> 00:37:42,196
Hi.

232
00:37:46,768 --> 00:37:48,669
- Scotch.
- Yeah, man.

233
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:54,242
Where'd you find
the Book of Mormon?

234
00:37:54,274 --> 00:37:57,245
Political appointee.
Not my choice.

235
00:37:57,277 --> 00:37:59,580
Seems intelligence
isn't central anymore.

236
00:38:00,548 --> 00:38:02,083
He smiles too much.

237
00:38:02,116 --> 00:38:03,851
Help us get this
into the right hands.

238
00:38:03,885 --> 00:38:05,385
Oh, what,
and you're the right hands?

239
00:38:05,418 --> 00:38:06,921
I'm not just a pretty face.

240
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:09,857
I stopped trusting pretty
faces a long time ago, Felix.

241
00:38:09,891 --> 00:38:11,859
Yeah, I heard. Bad luck.

242
00:38:11,893 --> 00:38:14,294
- Bad judgment.
- Yeah.

243
00:38:14,327 --> 00:38:16,030
Harder to tell
the good from bad,

244
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:17,665
villains from heroes
these days.

245
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,935
I need you, James.

246
00:38:20,968 --> 00:38:22,103
You're the only one
I trust with this.

247
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:23,538
I'm not screwing around.

248
00:38:23,571 --> 00:38:24,872
I wanna get back to my family,

249
00:38:24,906 --> 00:38:26,908
tell them
I saved the world again.

250
00:38:27,642 --> 00:38:28,643
Don't you?

251
00:38:31,913 --> 00:38:33,413
Nice to see you again, Felix.

252
00:38:35,348 --> 00:38:37,285
- At least take my number.
- I've got your number.

253
00:39:03,845 --> 00:39:05,513
In trouble?

254
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:09,250
Constantly.

255
00:39:09,283 --> 00:39:10,651
Need a ride?

256
00:39:12,286 --> 00:39:13,453
Sure. Why not?

257
00:39:17,457 --> 00:39:18,458
Hold on.

258
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,664
- What's your name?
- Nomi.

259
00:39:23,698 --> 00:39:26,300
- Yours?
- James. Call me James.

260
00:39:26,334 --> 00:39:28,803
- What do you do, Nomi?
- I'm a diver.

261
00:39:28,836 --> 00:39:32,439
- What do you dive for?
- I have a thing for old wrecks.

262
00:39:32,472 --> 00:39:35,810
Well, then you've come to the right place.

263
00:39:41,983 --> 00:39:43,317
After you.

264
00:39:55,229 --> 00:39:57,331
Hmm...

265
00:39:57,365 --> 00:39:58,566
Nice house.

266
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,735
Thank you.

267
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,903
Is that the bedroom?

268
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:07,341
Yes, it is.

269
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,194
Well,
that's not the first thing

270
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:28,930
I thought you'd take off,
but, uh...

271
00:40:28,963 --> 00:40:30,598
Yeah.

272
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:33,433
You seem like a man
who's gagging

273
00:40:33,466 --> 00:40:37,738
- for some action, Mr. Bond.
- Shall we cut to the chase?

274
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:39,740
I'm here
as a professional courtesy.

275
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:41,042
Well, you're not very
courteous, are you?

276
00:40:41,075 --> 00:40:42,944
You've broken my car...

277
00:40:42,977 --> 00:40:45,112
It's Commander Bond,
but you know that.

278
00:40:47,081 --> 00:40:48,883
- Double-0?
- Two years.

279
00:40:48,916 --> 00:40:50,251
- Very young.
- High achiever.

280
00:40:50,284 --> 00:40:53,087
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- The world's moved on

281
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,189
since you retired,
Commander Bond.

282
00:40:55,222 --> 00:40:57,224
- Perhaps you didn't notice.
- No, can't say I had.

283
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,961
And in my humble opinion,

284
00:40:59,994 --> 00:41:01,562
the world
doesn't change very much.

285
00:41:01,595 --> 00:41:03,698
You would say that.

286
00:41:03,731 --> 00:41:05,465
Look,
this all seems like heaven,

287
00:41:05,498 --> 00:41:07,201
this little bubble,
or whatever.

288
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:08,636
But it's so obvious

289
00:41:08,669 --> 00:41:10,871
you're a man
who only has time to kill,

290
00:41:10,905 --> 00:41:12,773
nothing to live for.

291
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:16,277
So Valdo Obruchev
is off-limits.

292
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,946
You get in my way, I will put
a bullet in your knee.

293
00:41:20,748 --> 00:41:21,916
The one that works.

294
00:41:24,452 --> 00:41:26,587
You need to ask yourself
a few more questions.

295
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:31,659
MI6, CIA
chasing after the same man,

296
00:41:31,692 --> 00:41:34,494
not communicating
with each other, that...

297
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:37,164
- That's not good.
- Hmm.

298
00:41:37,198 --> 00:41:40,634
You know what?
Tell M hello, but...

299
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:41,769
I don't work for him anymore.

300
00:41:43,537 --> 00:41:45,139
Tell him yourself.

301
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:49,477
By the way,

302
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,479
I'm not just any old double-0.

303
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:54,148
I'm 007.

304
00:41:56,684 --> 00:41:58,386
You probably
thought they'd retire it.

305
00:42:00,888 --> 00:42:03,924
It's just a number.

306
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:05,026
Yeah.

307
00:42:06,694 --> 00:42:07,628
See you in Cuba?

308
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:11,932
How's it going, Q?

309
00:42:11,966 --> 00:42:14,035
Several large files seem
to have been wiped

310
00:42:14,068 --> 00:42:15,669
from Obruchev's hard drive.

311
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:18,372
He was working on some
pretty advanced algorithm...

312
00:42:18,406 --> 00:42:20,975
- Can you retrieve the files?
- Trying.

313
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:23,277
Get me everything you can
and then destroy the drive.

314
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,046
If I knew more about
what this was, I could...

315
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,782
Thank you, Q. That's all.

316
00:42:27,815 --> 00:42:29,550
Yes. One minute.
The PM is calling again.

317
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:31,485
007.
Tell them something. Anything.

318
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:36,490
- 007.
- <i>M, darling.</i>

319
00:42:36,525 --> 00:42:37,658
<i>Couple of things.</i>

320
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:42,363
- Bond.
- I met your new 007.

321
00:42:42,396 --> 00:42:44,031
She's a disarming young woman.

322
00:42:44,765 --> 00:42:47,134
<i>So, Obruchev.</i>

323
00:42:47,168 --> 00:42:49,070
<i>You kept him
on the payroll, didn't you?</i>

324
00:42:49,103 --> 00:42:51,739
Stay out of it.
This has nothing to do with you.

325
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:54,208
It does. It's Spectre.

326
00:42:54,241 --> 00:42:57,945
Mallory, what have you done?

327
00:43:07,755 --> 00:43:09,757
- Double-0 trouble?
- The CIA have the advantage.

328
00:43:10,591 --> 00:43:11,992
Get me Blofeld.

329
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:13,761
Sir, he only speaks
to his psychiatrist.

330
00:43:13,794 --> 00:43:15,564
I know.
The live feed's what I want.

331
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:24,038
<i>They stay</i>
<i>straight in the middle.</i>

332
00:43:24,071 --> 00:43:26,006
<i>And then they bring him up.</i>

333
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,709
He's like this every day,
mad as a bag of bees.

334
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:31,112
- <i>It's crowning day.</i>
- Good.

335
00:43:31,145 --> 00:43:34,682
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

336
00:43:34,715 --> 00:43:38,352
<i>It's clean as can be.</i>
<i>Everyone just wants a party.</i>

337
00:43:38,385 --> 00:43:39,787
<i>Yeah, I want them both
to hear me.</i>

338
00:43:41,422 --> 00:43:42,490
<i>Be a surprise.</i>

339
00:44:08,482 --> 00:44:10,784
Felix, I'm in.

340
00:44:10,818 --> 00:44:12,820
<i>He's in.</i>

341
00:44:12,853 --> 00:44:15,122
<i>There's a young lady
in Santiago I want you to meet.</i>

342
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:05,406
Paloma?

343
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:11,445
- You're late. <i>Vamos.</i>
- I...

344
00:45:11,478 --> 00:45:14,281
Uh, something about a hat?
Paris, uh...

345
00:45:14,315 --> 00:45:15,650
Huh? What hat?

346
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,388
I forget things
when I get nervous.

347
00:45:21,422 --> 00:45:22,890
This is the biggest job
I've ever had.

348
00:45:36,904 --> 00:45:37,838
This your room?

349
00:45:38,939 --> 00:45:40,040
It's a wine cellar.

350
00:45:42,343 --> 00:45:43,712
Okay, come here.

351
00:45:47,448 --> 00:45:49,483
Don't you think we ought
to get to know each other

352
00:45:49,517 --> 00:45:51,318
just a little bit
before we, um...

353
00:45:51,352 --> 00:45:53,921
Oh...
No, no, no, no.

354
00:45:53,954 --> 00:45:57,758
Um, no, I'm sorry.
Um...

355
00:45:57,791 --> 00:45:59,561
- All right.
- You do it.

356
00:45:59,594 --> 00:46:01,128
Thank you.

357
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:05,734
Do you mind, uh...

358
00:46:11,105 --> 00:46:14,375
- This is gonna go brilliantly.
- I know.

359
00:46:14,408 --> 00:46:15,543
I've done
three weeks' training.

360
00:46:38,832 --> 00:46:40,234
Let's get a drink.

361
00:46:41,402 --> 00:46:42,903
Good idea.

362
00:46:47,676 --> 00:46:50,110
Two vodka martinis,
shaken, not stirred.

363
00:46:50,144 --> 00:46:51,145
<i>Si, senor.</i>

364
00:47:02,956 --> 00:47:04,592
So I can hear you.

365
00:47:11,332 --> 00:47:12,534
What shall we drink to?

366
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:15,969
- Felix?
- To Felix.

367
00:47:18,205 --> 00:47:19,641
Remind me to get him a cigar.

368
00:47:30,217 --> 00:47:31,185
<i>Vamos?</i>

369
00:47:31,218 --> 00:47:32,486
- Sure.
- Okay.

370
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:43,464
Will this sample
be enough for you?

371
00:47:43,497 --> 00:47:45,966
If he has used it, yes.

372
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:47,334
It is now progressing.

373
00:47:54,509 --> 00:47:56,243
Oops. Sorry.

374
00:47:57,545 --> 00:48:00,815
Terrible, terrible gloves.
So slippery.

375
00:48:01,915 --> 00:48:02,851
Forgive me.

376
00:48:03,585 --> 00:48:04,686
How much longer?

377
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:10,859
A-ha.

378
00:48:12,926 --> 00:48:14,863
To happy new future
for Spectre.

379
00:48:17,931 --> 00:48:19,032
Now, it is ready.

380
00:48:49,898 --> 00:48:51,231
You go that way.

381
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:52,801
I'll go this way.

382
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,877
<i>What is this?
Spectre bunga-bunga?</i>

383
00:49:04,746 --> 00:49:06,881
<i>You ever been
to a party like this?</i>

384
00:49:06,915 --> 00:49:08,750
<i>How
do you think I got this job?</i>

385
00:49:08,783 --> 00:49:10,552
<i>Don't get distracted, now.</i>

386
00:49:10,585 --> 00:49:12,921
<i>Remember, we're looking
for our Russian scientist.</i>

387
00:49:12,953 --> 00:49:14,556
<i>I'm seeing</i>
<i>a lot of Spectre agents.</i>

388
00:49:14,589 --> 00:49:16,724
Yes.

389
00:49:16,758 --> 00:49:17,958
And it looks like all of them.

390
00:49:22,496 --> 00:49:23,565
Wow.

391
00:49:34,441 --> 00:49:35,944
<i>Friend of yours?</i>

392
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:39,146
Cyclops. We ran
into each other in Italy.

393
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:42,316
That was
an eye-opening experience.

394
00:49:44,485 --> 00:49:46,453
They're wearing earpieces.

395
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:47,988
Scanning.

396
00:49:56,096 --> 00:49:59,233
<i>It'll be clean. It's good.
It's as good as can be.</i>

397
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:01,101
- <i>It's my party.</i>
- Ah. Found it.

398
00:50:01,134 --> 00:50:03,103
<i>Celebrate me,</i>
<i>my birthday,</i>

399
00:50:03,136 --> 00:50:04,506
<i>my crowning day.</i>

400
00:50:06,808 --> 00:50:08,141
<i>Who's the birthday boy?</i>

401
00:50:08,175 --> 00:50:09,944
Um...

402
00:50:09,978 --> 00:50:13,247
- Ernst Stavro Blofeld.
- Is he here?

403
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,248
No, he's...

404
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:16,183
<i>Make your way.</i>
<i>Follow the music.</i>

405
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:18,151
He's in London in prison.

406
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:20,588
<i>How do you know for sure?</i>

407
00:50:20,622 --> 00:50:22,757
Because I put him there.

408
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,592
<i>...feel my warm embrace.</i>

409
00:50:24,626 --> 00:50:28,028
<i>Experience</i>
<i>a delicious surprise.</i>

410
00:50:29,396 --> 00:50:31,699
<i>Let us shepherd humanity</i>

411
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:32,967
<i>with our new power.</i>

412
00:50:33,001 --> 00:50:34,201
I've spotted him,

413
00:50:34,234 --> 00:50:36,804
<i>our little Russian scientist.</i>

414
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:38,372
- Have you got him?
- <i>I'm here.</i>

415
00:50:38,405 --> 00:50:41,009
- I got him.
- <i>Stay with him.</i>

416
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:43,945
<i>But I see you</i>
<i>from my little eye,</i>

417
00:50:43,978 --> 00:50:46,346
<i>and my little eye says hi.</i>

418
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,884
<i>Now, see, now,</i>

419
00:50:49,918 --> 00:50:53,420
<i>we emerge from the shadows
as gods on Mount Olympus.</i>

420
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:57,992
<i>Here's to the end
of our pariah.</i>

421
00:50:58,026 --> 00:51:00,995
<i>Oh, my burden, my brother...</i>

422
00:51:03,096 --> 00:51:04,431
<i>James Bond.</i>

423
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,467
<i>Goodbye, James.</i>

424
00:51:10,672 --> 00:51:12,840
<i>You're popular tonight.</i>

425
00:51:14,107 --> 00:51:15,677
<i>You can't run.</i>

426
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:18,078
<i>It's too late.</i>

427
00:51:21,015 --> 00:51:24,652
<i>It's already crawling
under your skin.</i>

428
00:51:24,686 --> 00:51:27,254
<i>Don't be alarmed,
it's harmless to us.</i>

429
00:51:27,287 --> 00:51:30,457
<i>Just to him. So delicious.</i>

430
00:51:38,032 --> 00:51:39,067
Sir!

431
00:51:42,436 --> 00:51:44,038
It is working.

432
00:51:44,072 --> 00:51:45,873
It is working.
Only Spectre are dying.

433
00:51:57,952 --> 00:51:59,721
Hello.

434
00:51:59,754 --> 00:52:02,790
Are you for my, uh, esco...

435
00:52:02,824 --> 00:52:05,492
- Hmm?
- No? Oh.

436
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:13,067
Go!

437
00:52:24,512 --> 00:52:26,480
- Thank you. I'll take this.
- No!

438
00:52:26,514 --> 00:52:27,548
- What was that?
- Get him!

439
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:38,325
Time to go. Let's go!

440
00:52:50,437 --> 00:52:52,272
It's clear.

441
00:52:56,511 --> 00:52:58,079
May I cut in?

442
00:53:02,116 --> 00:53:04,317
Go get him.
I'll hold them off.

443
00:53:04,351 --> 00:53:06,319
Cover the exits!

444
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:07,320
Paloma.

445
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:12,325
Don't let them
get away!

446
00:53:17,832 --> 00:53:19,600
<i>Have you got them?</i>

447
00:53:19,634 --> 00:53:21,368
<i>Nearly.</i>

448
00:53:21,401 --> 00:53:22,402
No!

449
00:53:39,554 --> 00:53:40,588
Down!

450
00:53:43,725 --> 00:53:45,325
Get them!
Don't let them get away!

451
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:46,828
<i>Paloma,</i>
<i>I know you're busy,</i>

452
00:53:46,861 --> 00:53:48,963
<i>but the curtain's about
to come down on this one.</i>

453
00:53:48,996 --> 00:53:50,798
<i>I can get a car.</i>
<i>Where do you need it?</i>

454
00:53:50,832 --> 00:53:52,667
I'll be right there.

455
00:53:58,573 --> 00:53:59,841
Stay down!

456
00:54:02,944 --> 00:54:04,011
Move!

457
00:54:33,107 --> 00:54:34,075
Huh?

458
00:54:43,651 --> 00:54:44,484
Come on!

459
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,228
Three weeks' training,
really?

460
00:54:54,262 --> 00:54:55,295
More or less.

461
00:54:55,328 --> 00:54:56,631
We're still gonna
need that car.

462
00:54:56,664 --> 00:54:58,232
- <i>Salud!</i>
- <i>Salud!</i>

463
00:55:23,356 --> 00:55:25,293
Where are you taking me?

464
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:26,459
I'm taking you back
to Mother, darling.

465
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:28,129
Mother? Oh, no, no, no.

466
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,868
Huh. There you are.

467
00:55:42,342 --> 00:55:43,476
No!

468
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:51,953
Stay there!

469
00:55:51,986 --> 00:55:53,988
- You okay?
- I'm great.

470
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:04,332
I'm gonna borrow
your plane. Sorry.

471
00:56:25,987 --> 00:56:27,021
It's a shortcut.

472
00:56:41,369 --> 00:56:43,371
This is my stop. Goodbye.

473
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,175
- You were excellent.
- You too.

474
00:56:48,209 --> 00:56:50,912
- Next time, stay longer.
- I will.

475
00:56:50,945 --> 00:56:53,014
- Hey, a cigar for Felix.
- Thank you. Come on.

476
00:56:53,047 --> 00:56:54,248
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

477
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:03,591
Come on, let's go.

478
00:57:03,624 --> 00:57:06,360
No, no, no, sir,
I am not getting on that.

479
00:57:06,394 --> 00:57:09,997
Well, that's a shame
because we don't have a choice.

480
00:57:10,031 --> 00:57:11,832
Let's go. Come on.

481
00:57:14,201 --> 00:57:16,570
Okay, okay,
what have we got here?

482
00:57:31,552 --> 00:57:35,890
Sir, I just saved your life, okay?
Please remember that.

483
00:57:35,923 --> 00:57:39,560
So, could you please tell me
what the hell is going on?

484
00:57:39,593 --> 00:57:40,828
Where are you taking me?

485
00:57:42,263 --> 00:57:43,431
Somewhere safe.

486
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,892
At least make it look hard.

487
00:58:11,926 --> 00:58:13,661
Thanks, Felix,
you walked me into a trap. Get in.

488
00:58:16,097 --> 00:58:18,766
- What trap?
- Spectre's dead. Sit.

489
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,301
- Who's dead?
- All of them.

490
00:58:20,334 --> 00:58:21,335
Good.

491
00:58:23,704 --> 00:58:26,741
What is this?
Explain it to me.

492
00:58:26,774 --> 00:58:29,510
I don't have the words to
describe to someone like you.

493
00:58:29,543 --> 00:58:30,644
Try one.

494
00:58:32,046 --> 00:58:34,648
It's perfect.

495
00:58:34,682 --> 00:58:36,117
A perfect what?

496
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:37,651
What? Assassin.

497
00:58:37,685 --> 00:58:39,420
Thank you, Bond,
your mission's done.

498
00:58:39,453 --> 00:58:40,921
- Why didn't it kill me?
- You don't have to answer

499
00:58:40,955 --> 00:58:42,957
- those questions. Bond!
- Why Spectre?

500
00:58:42,990 --> 00:58:44,859
- Bond, please stop asking these questions.
- Quiet!

501
00:58:44,892 --> 00:58:46,527
Speak up.

502
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:50,097
Because you were never
the intended target.

503
00:58:50,131 --> 00:58:51,866
He was a target? Why?

504
00:58:51,899 --> 00:58:54,301
I changed the DNA
like we decided.

505
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,836
Now the plan is complete

506
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:57,471
- and I'm confused.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

507
00:58:57,506 --> 00:58:59,473
Who is "we"?
Did M make you build this?

508
00:58:59,508 --> 00:59:00,841
He is out of line here, Felix.

509
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:02,777
Did M order you
to kill Spectre?

510
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:04,478
- Don't answer that!
- Is M behind this?

511
00:59:04,513 --> 00:59:05,880
- He is out of line!
- Felix!

512
00:59:05,913 --> 00:59:07,648
Ash, shut your mouth!

513
00:59:07,681 --> 00:59:09,683
M.
M helped me build it.

514
00:59:09,717 --> 00:59:11,719
But please,
he does not have the vision

515
00:59:11,752 --> 00:59:14,121
- for how to use it.
- Well, who does? Who does?

516
00:59:14,155 --> 00:59:17,491
Blofeld? How did he know
I was going to be there?

517
00:59:25,366 --> 00:59:26,734
Oh!

518
01:00:14,982 --> 01:00:16,450
I'm with Safin.
You understand?

519
01:00:16,484 --> 01:00:18,786
Yes. I am Dr. Obruchev.

520
01:00:18,819 --> 01:00:20,589
I know who you are.

521
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:24,593
I don't know about you,

522
01:00:25,993 --> 01:00:28,395
but I got a feeling in my gut
Ash might not be on our side.

523
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:31,765
We need to have a conversation

524
01:00:31,799 --> 01:00:33,300
about the company you keep.

525
01:00:33,334 --> 01:00:34,569
I'm with you.

526
01:00:37,671 --> 01:00:38,672
That's a lot of blood.

527
01:00:42,577 --> 01:00:44,812
So,
where are we going?

528
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,748
Get in the plane, Doctor.

529
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:49,783
This might be my last mission.

530
01:00:49,817 --> 01:00:51,586
- What do you think?
- I think you're just looking

531
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,254
for an excuse
not to help me.

532
01:00:53,287 --> 01:00:55,089
There you go.

533
01:00:55,122 --> 01:00:57,057
Paloma, she gave me a cigar
for you to smoke,

534
01:00:57,091 --> 01:00:58,826
and you are gonna smoke it.

535
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:01,630
Nice, but maybe you should
hold on to that for now.

536
01:01:01,662 --> 01:01:04,331
You just stay put.
Keep the pressure on that.

537
01:01:04,365 --> 01:01:05,634
I'm gonna find us a way out.

538
01:01:07,636 --> 01:01:09,503
I'll be over here.

539
01:01:09,538 --> 01:01:11,071
You know, Felix, we really
need to stop meeting...

540
01:01:17,546 --> 01:01:20,447
- Ooh.
- Okay.

541
01:01:20,481 --> 01:01:22,483
I was such
a big fan of his.

542
01:01:29,123 --> 01:01:30,457
Felix!

543
01:01:43,505 --> 01:01:44,805
This doesn't look good.

544
01:01:46,073 --> 01:01:50,811
Come on, Felix,
we've been in worse than this. Let's go.

545
01:01:50,844 --> 01:01:53,847
It's like back when I was
a kid on that shrimp boat.

546
01:01:53,881 --> 01:01:55,849
You're from Milwaukee.

547
01:01:55,883 --> 01:01:57,885
Am I?
I thought I made that up.

548
01:02:04,358 --> 01:02:06,727
He got me.

549
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,196
Just let me go.
Let me go.

550
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:17,738
You got this?

551
01:02:20,575 --> 01:02:21,909
Yeah. Yeah.

552
01:02:24,078 --> 01:02:25,547
Make it worth it.

553
01:02:28,349 --> 01:02:30,384
James,

554
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:32,853
it's a good life, isn't it?

555
01:02:35,122 --> 01:02:36,558
The best.

556
01:02:41,095 --> 01:02:42,096
Felix.

557
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:46,735
Felix. Felix.

558
01:05:16,016 --> 01:05:17,384
- Name?
- Bond.

559
01:05:20,889 --> 01:05:22,624
James Bond.

560
01:05:27,428 --> 01:05:28,663
How's retirement?

561
01:05:28,696 --> 01:05:29,764
Quiet.

562
01:05:32,466 --> 01:05:35,703
Hi. Where's Obruchev?

563
01:05:35,737 --> 01:05:37,438
I thought you two
would get along.

564
01:05:37,471 --> 01:05:40,073
- Report, 007.
- Thank you.

565
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,544
00... 7.

566
01:05:44,478 --> 01:05:45,713
That must bother you.

567
01:05:49,216 --> 01:05:50,585
Where is he?

568
01:05:50,618 --> 01:05:52,352
He left me for somebody else.

569
01:05:52,386 --> 01:05:53,721
It's, uh...

570
01:05:53,755 --> 01:05:55,456
- So, you lost him?
- You can go in.

571
01:05:55,489 --> 01:05:57,859
- Thank you.
- Thank y...

572
01:05:57,892 --> 01:05:59,159
Alone, I'm afraid.

573
01:06:00,895 --> 01:06:01,896
Oh, does that bother you?

574
01:06:09,236 --> 01:06:10,404
I get why you shot him.

575
01:06:10,437 --> 01:06:11,573
Yeah, well,

576
01:06:11,606 --> 01:06:13,842
everyone tries at least once.

577
01:06:18,245 --> 01:06:20,849
Has this desk got bigger?

578
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:24,485
Or have you got smaller?

579
01:06:27,187 --> 01:06:29,389
I can't pretend there
weren't some sorry faces

580
01:06:29,423 --> 01:06:30,792
when you left us, Bond,

581
01:06:30,825 --> 01:06:33,561
but you fell
so far off the grid

582
01:06:33,595 --> 01:06:34,796
that we thought
you must be dead.

583
01:06:36,764 --> 01:06:37,966
Now, learning that you

584
01:06:39,433 --> 01:06:41,803
were, in fact,
alive and well, and...

585
01:06:43,705 --> 01:06:45,940
working for the CIA, well...

586
01:06:49,611 --> 01:06:50,979
Well, that really was a blow.

587
01:06:51,011 --> 01:06:53,982
Well,
they just asked so nicely.

588
01:06:55,783 --> 01:06:58,352
It's a shame that you
haven't lost your touch.

589
01:06:59,888 --> 01:07:01,321
We wouldn't be in this mess.

590
01:07:02,790 --> 01:07:04,157
This is your mess.

591
01:07:06,059 --> 01:07:07,829
Blofeld tried to kill me
in Cuba,

592
01:07:07,862 --> 01:07:09,731
but someone hijacked his plan.

593
01:07:10,865 --> 01:07:12,800
And whoever stole your weapon

594
01:07:12,834 --> 01:07:15,703
used it
to wipe out Spectre instead.

595
01:07:15,737 --> 01:07:18,540
Now your weapon is on the run

596
01:07:18,573 --> 01:07:21,375
and nobody seems
to know who has it.

597
01:07:21,408 --> 01:07:23,511
So you can imagine
why I've come back to play.

598
01:07:23,545 --> 01:07:25,045
We're looking into it.

599
01:07:25,078 --> 01:07:27,147
I can identify
the man that took Obruchev.

600
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,650
And what do you want
in return, Bond?

601
01:07:29,984 --> 01:07:31,051
Blofeld.

602
01:07:31,084 --> 01:07:33,387
Impossible. He's in Belmarsh.

603
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:35,990
Yes. He ran a Spectre meeting

604
01:07:36,024 --> 01:07:38,158
in Cuba from Belmarsh.

605
01:07:38,191 --> 01:07:39,727
- How?
- No.

606
01:07:39,761 --> 01:07:42,564
How?
No one has access. No one.

607
01:07:42,597 --> 01:07:46,366
Why didn't you shut it down?

608
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,201
Why didn't you
shut Heracles down?

609
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:51,171
I answer to the interests
of my country, not you.

610
01:07:51,204 --> 01:07:54,809
- And to Felix Leiter?
- I certainly don't answer to Felix Leiter.

611
01:07:54,842 --> 01:07:56,744
Perhaps because he's dead.

612
01:08:03,618 --> 01:08:04,886
I'm sorry.

613
01:08:06,788 --> 01:08:08,455
I had a lot of respect
for Leiter.

614
01:08:14,194 --> 01:08:17,230
Look, if you have information,
I'd be happy to receive it.

615
01:08:17,264 --> 01:08:19,266
- Get me into Belmarsh.
- No.

616
01:08:19,299 --> 01:08:21,736
Blofeld's the only member
of Spectre still breathing,

617
01:08:21,769 --> 01:08:23,270
- I can't risk that.
- Oh, but you will

618
01:08:23,303 --> 01:08:25,907
risk developing
a DNA-targeting weapon

619
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:28,676
with a corrupt scientist
for ten years?

620
01:08:28,710 --> 01:08:31,045
There was nothing
to suggest that Obruchev

621
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:33,047
was working for anyone else.
I had him...

622
01:08:33,081 --> 01:08:35,049
My God,
you're thirsty at the moment.

623
01:08:36,784 --> 01:08:39,687
You have no right
to speak to me that way.

624
01:08:39,721 --> 01:08:43,423
You have no right to make
insinuations about my judgment.

625
01:08:43,457 --> 01:08:47,695
If you've nothing left
to give, you are irrelevant.

626
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:49,530
You've done your bit and we
thank you for your service,

627
01:08:49,564 --> 01:08:51,899
again. Goodbye.

628
01:08:53,735 --> 01:08:56,303
Moneypenny, send in 007.

629
01:08:56,336 --> 01:08:57,404
You can go, Bond.

630
01:09:04,912 --> 01:09:06,446
It's definitely the same desk.

631
01:09:11,184 --> 01:09:12,452
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

632
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:19,093
Go to Belmarsh.

633
01:09:19,127 --> 01:09:21,596
I want everything
that Blofeld listens to,

634
01:09:21,629 --> 01:09:23,931
looks at and touches scanned.

635
01:09:23,965 --> 01:09:25,667
Scan every corner
of that cell.

636
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,501
Scan the whole prison.

637
01:09:27,535 --> 01:09:30,337
In fact,
scan the whole damn man.

638
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:32,974
Sir. I'll bring my gloves.

639
01:09:36,778 --> 01:09:38,980
James...
Uh...

640
01:09:41,348 --> 01:09:42,817
What are you doing for dinner?

641
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,816
- So, you're not dead?
- Hello, Q. I've missed you.

642
01:10:16,216 --> 01:10:18,218
Mm!
That smells great.

643
01:10:18,251 --> 01:10:20,021
Were you expecting somebody?

644
01:10:20,054 --> 01:10:22,657
Um... No. What...
Excuse me.

645
01:10:23,858 --> 01:10:25,693
Oh.

646
01:10:25,727 --> 01:10:29,396
This is the first time I've...
He'll be here in 20 minutes,

647
01:10:29,429 --> 01:10:31,032
I can't take my focus off...

648
01:10:31,065 --> 01:10:32,633
I need you to tell me
what's on that.

649
01:10:32,667 --> 01:10:34,367
No, I need to lay the table.

650
01:10:38,438 --> 01:10:40,875
You know,
they come with fur these days.

651
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:44,411
I want to be very clear that I
am not authorized to help you.

652
01:10:44,444 --> 01:10:46,581
- And I have sworn...
- It's to do with Heracles.

653
01:10:49,517 --> 01:10:51,586
I presume M doesn't know
that this is happening.

654
01:10:51,619 --> 01:10:54,354
No, but there's something
going on, Q.

655
01:10:54,387 --> 01:10:55,556
We need to find out
what it is.

656
01:11:01,629 --> 01:11:03,097
Well, it's never
9:00 to 5:00, is it?

657
01:11:04,699 --> 01:11:06,200
Thank you.

658
01:11:11,404 --> 01:11:13,440
- Um, Bond?
- Yes?

659
01:11:13,473 --> 01:11:14,876
Do you know
where this has been?

660
01:11:14,909 --> 01:11:16,244
Everywhere, I should imagine.

661
01:11:17,712 --> 01:11:18,780
Into the sandbox.

662
01:11:23,785 --> 01:11:24,919
Oh. Thank you.

663
01:11:27,054 --> 01:11:29,289
Um, it's a database.

664
01:11:29,322 --> 01:11:31,726
Don't touch that, please.

665
01:11:31,759 --> 01:11:33,060
What's the data?

666
01:11:33,094 --> 01:11:35,395
It's DNA.
Multiple individuals.

667
01:11:35,428 --> 01:11:37,031
What was M working on?

668
01:11:37,064 --> 01:11:39,033
Something he should have
shut down years ago.

669
01:11:39,066 --> 01:11:40,802
- Oh, hello.
- What?

670
01:11:40,835 --> 01:11:43,137
There's more.
Hidden files.

671
01:11:43,171 --> 01:11:46,073
I was asked to recover
what I could

672
01:11:46,107 --> 01:11:48,810
from Obruchev's hard drive
just after the explosion,

673
01:11:48,843 --> 01:11:50,611
and I have
a pretty good feeling that...

674
01:11:50,645 --> 01:11:54,749
this is what was missing.
Yeah. A complete disk.

675
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:02,156
So, Obruchev is working
for someone

676
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:03,591
who managed
to kill all of Spectre?

677
01:12:03,624 --> 01:12:05,092
Not all of them.

678
01:12:06,694 --> 01:12:07,995
Blofeld.

679
01:12:08,029 --> 01:12:09,597
Can you show me
the other files?

680
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:11,032
Mm-hmm.

681
01:12:16,469 --> 01:12:18,873
Wait,
this can't just be Spectre.

682
01:12:20,174 --> 01:12:23,845
Oh, my God.
There are thousands.

683
01:12:25,513 --> 01:12:26,514
Who are they?

684
01:12:27,882 --> 01:12:29,317
They're in categories.

685
01:12:29,349 --> 01:12:31,351
I'm gonna need
more time to organize...

686
01:12:31,384 --> 01:12:33,187
There have been, uh, breaches

687
01:12:33,221 --> 01:12:35,957
round the world of databases
holding DNA information.

688
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:39,392
- We've been tracking them.
- Ours?

689
01:12:39,426 --> 01:12:40,862
I can't imagine
they're leaving us out,

690
01:12:40,895 --> 01:12:42,663
whoever they are.

691
01:12:42,697 --> 01:12:44,866
Well, Blofeld
will know who they are.

692
01:12:44,899 --> 01:12:46,200
Q, you need to get me
into Belmarsh.

693
01:12:48,803 --> 01:12:51,706
Well, there's only one person
he'll speak to.

694
01:12:51,739 --> 01:12:54,609
Who? M says no one has access.

695
01:12:54,642 --> 01:12:56,711
- Really?
- Did he?

696
01:12:56,744 --> 01:12:58,279
What's that?

697
01:12:59,981 --> 01:13:02,016
Can I just have
one nice evening, please,

698
01:13:02,049 --> 01:13:03,117
before the world explodes?

699
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:05,319
Who has access? Who?

700
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,061
- Morning.
- Morning.

701
01:13:14,095 --> 01:13:17,131
New patient.
He's weird.

702
01:13:17,164 --> 01:13:18,833
You can't say that.

703
01:13:24,906 --> 01:13:25,873
I'm sorry I'm late.

704
01:13:28,542 --> 01:13:30,211
I wasn't expecting
a new patient.

705
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:37,919
Sorry if I surprised you.

706
01:13:38,619 --> 01:13:40,755
No. I like surprises.

707
01:13:44,592 --> 01:13:47,561
You're very attractive
for a psychotherapist.

708
01:13:47,595 --> 01:13:49,730
Must be dangerous
for your clients.

709
01:13:54,434 --> 01:13:56,436
They are usually more
of a danger to themselves.

710
01:14:01,075 --> 01:14:02,209
Foxgloves.

711
01:14:02,944 --> 01:14:04,045
Beautiful.

712
01:14:05,478 --> 01:14:07,181
- Did you choose them?
- Yes.

713
01:14:07,214 --> 01:14:08,950
I found them friendly.

714
01:14:08,983 --> 01:14:10,618
You know if you eat them

715
01:14:10,651 --> 01:14:12,920
they can cause your heart
to just...

716
01:14:15,957 --> 01:14:16,924
stop.

717
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:19,994
Then I'll make sure not to.

718
01:14:27,802 --> 01:14:29,070
Do you know a lot
about flowers?

719
01:14:29,103 --> 01:14:31,772
My father had a garden.

720
01:14:31,806 --> 01:14:33,040
He taught me.

721
01:14:33,074 --> 01:14:38,412
He died when I was young,
but my interest remained.

722
01:14:39,479 --> 01:14:40,915
It's difficult
to lose a parent.

723
01:14:43,317 --> 01:14:44,585
Especially at a young age.

724
01:14:45,686 --> 01:14:46,988
Yes,

725
01:14:47,021 --> 01:14:50,791
death has a particular
effect on children,

726
01:14:52,259 --> 01:14:53,094
doesn't it?

727
01:14:56,263 --> 01:14:57,832
What effect
did it have on you?

728
01:14:58,498 --> 01:14:59,834
Profound.

729
01:14:59,867 --> 01:15:02,670
But I saved a life once.

730
01:15:04,338 --> 01:15:05,940
I think that had
more of an effect.

731
01:15:07,875 --> 01:15:08,843
Why is that?

732
01:15:08,876 --> 01:15:11,445
Saving someone's life

733
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:15,716
connects you to them forever,
the same as taking it.

734
01:15:17,551 --> 01:15:18,819
They belong to you.

735
01:15:23,691 --> 01:15:26,160
I'm not very good
at talking about myself,

736
01:15:26,193 --> 01:15:28,295
so I brought a memory box.

737
01:15:31,665 --> 01:15:34,201
I thought
it might interest you.

738
01:15:34,235 --> 01:15:37,506
Sometimes objects can be
more evocative than memories.

739
01:15:49,483 --> 01:15:52,353
I never forgot your eyes
under the ice.

740
01:15:54,755 --> 01:15:56,090
They needed me.

741
01:15:58,426 --> 01:16:01,662
It is a shock to see them
so many years later.

742
01:16:03,998 --> 01:16:05,166
They still need me.

743
01:16:06,367 --> 01:16:08,803
I am rather taken by them.

744
01:16:08,836 --> 01:16:11,005
- What do you want?
- Just a favor.

745
01:16:12,339 --> 01:16:13,240
You owe me.

746
01:16:14,509 --> 01:16:16,143
You murdered my mother.

747
01:16:16,177 --> 01:16:19,213
And your father
killed my entire family.

748
01:16:22,016 --> 01:16:23,818
Parents.

749
01:16:23,851 --> 01:16:27,221
I need you to visit someone for
me, wearing this.

750
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:30,525
It's harmless to you.

751
01:16:35,429 --> 01:16:37,364
You are the only one
who can do it.

752
01:16:38,799 --> 01:16:39,733
No.

753
01:16:40,734 --> 01:16:42,603
Why would I do
anything for you?

754
01:16:42,636 --> 01:16:49,110
Because I am a man willing to
kill the person you love most.

755
01:16:49,143 --> 01:16:51,445
I've already lost everyone
I've ever loved.

756
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,815
There is nothing
you can threaten me with.

757
01:16:57,451 --> 01:16:59,787
That is very sad to hear,
Madeleine.

758
01:17:05,459 --> 01:17:06,894
But it is not true...

759
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:13,467
is it?

760
01:17:21,442 --> 01:17:23,944
Madeleine Swann, really?

761
01:17:23,978 --> 01:17:26,447
Well, yes. We took
your information seriously,

762
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:29,584
but that was five years ago.
Nothing came up.

763
01:17:29,618 --> 01:17:31,752
Well, she's very smart and
very good at hiding things.

764
01:17:31,785 --> 01:17:33,053
She's a useful asset.

765
01:17:33,087 --> 01:17:36,056
She's the only psychiatrist
he agreed to speak to.

766
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:37,658
I had to exercise
my judgment...

767
01:17:37,691 --> 01:17:38,959
Your judgment is the problem.

768
01:17:40,828 --> 01:17:43,130
That weapon was designed
to save lives

769
01:17:43,164 --> 01:17:45,833
and to eradicate collateral
damage for our agents.

770
01:17:47,468 --> 01:17:49,703
A clean,
accurate shot every time.

771
01:17:50,771 --> 01:17:52,473
But it had to be off the books.

772
01:17:53,542 --> 01:17:56,110
There are enough holes
in our national security.

773
01:17:57,811 --> 01:17:59,680
If the world knows
what this can do...

774
01:17:59,713 --> 01:18:01,782
- They'd kill for it.
- Mm.

775
01:18:02,651 --> 01:18:03,618
Look...

776
01:18:05,886 --> 01:18:10,391
If it's an error, it's on my
shoulders, fair and square.

777
01:18:12,459 --> 01:18:14,795
I've dedicated my life
to defending this country.

778
01:18:16,297 --> 01:18:18,999
I believe in defending
the principles of this...

779
01:18:19,033 --> 01:18:20,334
Of this.

780
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:24,705
But we used to be able to get
into a room with the enemy,

781
01:18:24,738 --> 01:18:25,873
we could look him in the eye.

782
01:18:26,874 --> 01:18:28,008
And now the...

783
01:18:30,244 --> 01:18:33,480
The enemy
is just floating in the ether.

784
01:18:33,515 --> 01:18:34,882
We don't even know
what they're after.

785
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,251
Blofeld.

786
01:18:38,886 --> 01:18:41,388
We managed to access
a database of their targets.

787
01:18:41,422 --> 01:18:42,524
"We"?

788
01:18:44,725 --> 01:18:46,026
Oh, for fuck's sake.

789
01:18:47,494 --> 01:18:48,563
I see.

790
01:18:50,030 --> 01:18:51,765
And after Blofeld,
what do they want?

791
01:18:53,334 --> 01:18:54,501
Well, it's hard to say.

792
01:18:54,536 --> 01:18:56,170
I mean,
I would imagine world leaders,

793
01:18:56,203 --> 01:18:59,541
innocent civilians, freedom,
you know, that sort of thing.

794
01:18:59,574 --> 01:19:02,309
Oh, good,
well, just the usual.

795
01:19:02,343 --> 01:19:03,911
Just the usual.

796
01:19:07,781 --> 01:19:10,518
Blofeld was communicating
with his agents in Cuba

797
01:19:10,552 --> 01:19:14,421
through a bionic eye
which we've now retrieved.

798
01:19:14,455 --> 01:19:16,857
You're welcome.

799
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:20,729
Spectre's destruction's going
to have huge consequences.

800
01:19:20,761 --> 01:19:24,098
Whoever did this is going to be
very dangerous and very powerful.

801
01:19:26,433 --> 01:19:29,270
We need all the information
that we can gather.

802
01:19:29,303 --> 01:19:30,471
Sir.

803
01:19:31,706 --> 01:19:32,574
Sir.

804
01:19:34,576 --> 01:19:35,610
Bond.

805
01:19:36,645 --> 01:19:39,446
So the rumors are true.
You look well.

806
01:19:39,480 --> 01:19:40,548
Tanner.

807
01:19:41,482 --> 01:19:43,317
Sir,
there's been a development.

808
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:47,221
They were
just dropping,

809
01:19:47,254 --> 01:19:48,523
one right after the other.

810
01:19:48,556 --> 01:19:51,559
It was disturbing,
to say the least.

811
01:19:51,593 --> 01:19:54,161
Wait till you see
what it looks like up close.

812
01:19:54,194 --> 01:19:57,298
- Uh, Bond's in the office.
- What?

813
01:20:00,901 --> 01:20:04,539
Oh, Bond. My God,
I haven't seen you in, in, uh...

814
01:20:04,572 --> 01:20:06,206
- How is your retirement?
- Shut up, Q.

815
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:08,075
I know he's staying with you.

816
01:20:08,108 --> 01:20:09,910
And you're not
in the clear either.

817
01:20:09,943 --> 01:20:12,146
- What happened?
- He's been reinstated as a double-0.

818
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:16,850
- Double-0 what?
- What have you got?

819
01:20:19,453 --> 01:20:21,488
Q has studied
the blood samples I gathered

820
01:20:21,523 --> 01:20:23,123
from the victims
of the funeral.

821
01:20:23,157 --> 01:20:25,159
Just look at this.

822
01:20:25,192 --> 01:20:27,428
What are we looking at?

823
01:20:27,461 --> 01:20:28,495
This is the funeral

824
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:31,165
of one of the dead
Spectre agents from Cuba.

825
01:20:31,198 --> 01:20:33,067
And here are
the members of their family

826
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:36,170
who made physical contact
with the corpse.

827
01:20:36,203 --> 01:20:38,773
We found Heracles in the
blood samples of all of them.

828
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:42,943
Now,
that's some good work, Nomi.

829
01:20:42,976 --> 01:20:44,945
Thank you, sir. Double-0 what?

830
01:20:44,978 --> 01:20:48,449
- What are they?
- They're... They're nanobots.

831
01:20:50,117 --> 01:20:51,218
Right.

832
01:20:51,251 --> 01:20:53,521
Microscopic bio-robots
that can enter your system

833
01:20:53,555 --> 01:20:55,289
by the slightest contact
with your skin.

834
01:21:00,994 --> 01:21:05,065
Programmed with DNA
to target specific individuals.

835
01:21:06,300 --> 01:21:07,669
Heracles was...

836
01:21:09,136 --> 01:21:13,307
It was designed to be the most
efficient weapon in our arsenal.

837
01:21:13,340 --> 01:21:15,309
Passing through
people harmlessly

838
01:21:15,342 --> 01:21:17,612
before reaching
its intended target.

839
01:21:17,645 --> 01:21:19,848
But Obruchev
modified the nanobots

840
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,182
so that they can kill anyone
related to the target.

841
01:21:22,216 --> 01:21:24,118
- Anyone?
- Well, since it's DNA-based,

842
01:21:24,151 --> 01:21:25,720
with further modifications,
yes.

843
01:21:26,688 --> 01:21:29,824
Families,
certain genetic traits.

844
01:21:29,858 --> 01:21:32,393
Single-nucleotide variants
and polymorphisms

845
01:21:32,426 --> 01:21:35,195
that could target a range
from individuals to...

846
01:21:35,229 --> 01:21:36,664
whole ethnicities.

847
01:21:37,364 --> 01:21:38,999
You infect enough people...

848
01:21:39,032 --> 01:21:40,869
And the people
become the weapon.

849
01:21:40,901 --> 01:21:44,004
It was never intended to be
a weapon of mass destruction.

850
01:21:45,874 --> 01:21:46,741
It was...

851
01:21:49,677 --> 01:21:51,211
I need to call
the Prime Minister.

852
01:21:52,279 --> 01:21:54,849
Tanner, quarantine
the families from the funeral.

853
01:21:54,883 --> 01:21:56,551
- Yes, sir.
- And, Q,

854
01:21:56,584 --> 01:21:58,352
hack into Blofeld's bionic eye,

855
01:21:58,385 --> 01:21:59,687
see what you can find.

856
01:22:01,188 --> 01:22:02,757
You've got your wish.

857
01:22:02,791 --> 01:22:05,827
Go to Blofeld and see
what you can get out of him.

858
01:22:05,860 --> 01:22:07,862
And find
that cockroach Obruchev.

859
01:22:08,763 --> 01:22:10,030
Sir.

860
01:22:13,568 --> 01:22:15,737
We don't have a trail.

861
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:19,273
Logan Ash. State Department.
Ex-State Department.

862
01:22:19,306 --> 01:22:21,408
Find him,
you'll find Obruchev.

863
01:22:21,442 --> 01:22:22,610
Um...

864
01:22:23,745 --> 01:22:25,345
Good luck.

865
01:22:25,379 --> 01:22:27,582
Thanks.

866
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,809
I'll be outside
when you're done

867
01:22:54,843 --> 01:22:56,477
with your important
preparation.

868
01:22:59,246 --> 01:23:00,481
I'll be just a moment.

869
01:23:01,816 --> 01:23:02,851
It's fine.

870
01:23:22,336 --> 01:23:24,271
<i>Blofeld's eyeball unlocked.</i>

871
01:23:28,877 --> 01:23:31,713
<i>Accessing
received media stream.</i>

872
01:23:32,814 --> 01:23:34,983
I know you
and she have a history,

873
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:38,151
but we've kept a close eye
on her over the years.

874
01:23:38,185 --> 01:23:39,587
She's been very compliant.

875
01:23:39,621 --> 01:23:41,188
If Bond does
anything weird in there,

876
01:23:41,221 --> 01:23:42,657
you'll be doing me
a huge favor,

877
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:44,926
so don't make it too easy
for him, okay?

878
01:23:44,959 --> 01:23:46,326
Okay.

879
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:49,429
He's the most valuable asset
this country has.

880
01:23:49,463 --> 01:23:51,265
I know you and he
have a history,

881
01:23:51,298 --> 01:23:54,334
but don't let him get
in your head.

882
01:23:54,368 --> 01:23:56,036
If you feel yourself
losing control...

883
01:23:56,069 --> 01:23:59,139
Oh, Tanner, relax.

884
01:23:59,172 --> 01:24:00,642
I'm not gonna lose...

885
01:24:05,647 --> 01:24:06,881
control.

886
01:24:12,754 --> 01:24:14,622
Dr. Swann, good afternoon.

887
01:24:20,427 --> 01:24:21,663
Mr. Bond.

888
01:24:26,266 --> 01:24:27,501
007.

889
01:24:32,072 --> 01:24:35,409
<i>Six-seven.
Special cell two now locked off.</i>

890
01:24:40,782 --> 01:24:42,850
<i>Segregation unit secure.</i>

891
01:24:42,884 --> 01:24:45,419
This is where we leave you.
Good luck.

892
01:24:45,452 --> 01:24:46,921
Just get us a name.

893
01:24:54,328 --> 01:24:58,131
Must be nice to catch up with
an old friend so regularly.

894
01:24:59,901 --> 01:25:02,102
We're closer than ever.

895
01:25:02,135 --> 01:25:04,038
Oh, that was awkward.

896
01:25:04,072 --> 01:25:05,607
Does he have that effect
on all women?

897
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,675
Fifty-fifty.

898
01:25:07,709 --> 01:25:08,876
- It's unpredictable.
- Huh.

899
01:25:12,145 --> 01:25:13,915
<i>Isolated in HSU.</i>

900
01:25:22,957 --> 01:25:23,992
You're shaking.

901
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,427
It's not an ideal situation.

902
01:25:57,592 --> 01:25:58,926
Open the door.

903
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,328
Open the door!

904
01:26:02,530 --> 01:26:04,599
- Don't.
- What is it?

905
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,003
James,
you don't know what this is.

906
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:11,639
Don't make me do this.

907
01:26:11,673 --> 01:26:13,340
Please.

908
01:26:13,373 --> 01:26:14,742
Right. Open the doors.

909
01:26:14,776 --> 01:26:16,343
- <i>Open the door.</i>
- Open it.

910
01:26:16,376 --> 01:26:17,477
What...

911
01:26:20,982 --> 01:26:22,016
Where are you going?

912
01:26:23,283 --> 01:26:24,519
Home.

913
01:26:28,355 --> 01:26:29,924
- I'll get her.
- Wait.

914
01:26:29,957 --> 01:26:32,359
- He won't talk without her.
- Just wait.

915
01:26:34,595 --> 01:26:35,563
Special delivery.

916
01:26:52,412 --> 01:26:53,246
James.

917
01:26:54,247 --> 01:26:55,215
Hello, Blofeld.

918
01:26:57,819 --> 01:27:00,387
Perhaps you can help me.

919
01:27:02,757 --> 01:27:04,357
Cuba was quite the party.

920
01:27:04,391 --> 01:27:06,994
- Happy birthday, by the way.
- Thank you.

921
01:27:07,028 --> 01:27:09,163
I'm trying to piece together
what happened.

922
01:27:10,665 --> 01:27:13,000
I mean, there you were,
or here you were,

923
01:27:13,034 --> 01:27:15,335
with the world's
most powerful people,

924
01:27:15,368 --> 01:27:19,339
your friends, all in one room,
a noose around my neck,

925
01:27:19,372 --> 01:27:22,043
and your hands on the most
valuable weapon in existence.

926
01:27:23,544 --> 01:27:25,680
It's like a...

927
01:27:25,713 --> 01:27:29,217
It was like a testimony
to your greatness.

928
01:27:29,249 --> 01:27:33,755
A celebration of all
that is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

929
01:27:33,788 --> 01:27:35,890
Yeah, James.

930
01:27:37,592 --> 01:27:39,426
Yeah.

931
01:27:39,459 --> 01:27:42,063
But then it all went wrong,
didn't it?

932
01:27:44,065 --> 01:27:47,235
My sweet James,
what do you want?

933
01:27:47,267 --> 01:27:48,803
Your enemies
are closing in, Blofeld.

934
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:52,006
And the biggest twist here

935
01:27:52,039 --> 01:27:54,474
is that if you tell me
who they are,

936
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:57,277
I could save your life.

937
01:27:57,310 --> 01:28:00,413
Mm, my avenging angel.

938
01:28:00,447 --> 01:28:03,050
My chaser of lost causes.

939
01:28:03,084 --> 01:28:05,853
Now you even chase mine.

940
01:28:05,887 --> 01:28:07,688
But you're asking
the wrong question.

941
01:28:07,722 --> 01:28:10,390
Yeah,
Cuba was a disappointment,

942
01:28:10,423 --> 01:28:13,027
but we all cry on our birthday.

943
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:15,096
<i>You need to ask yourself,</i>

944
01:28:15,129 --> 01:28:17,464
<i>why are we here?</i>

945
01:28:17,497 --> 01:28:20,300
<i>Accessing media file 472.</i>

946
01:28:22,003 --> 01:28:24,071
Hmm. Looking sharp, Bond.

947
01:28:24,105 --> 01:28:25,506
<i>473.</i>

948
01:28:26,808 --> 01:28:28,109
<i>474.</i>

949
01:28:29,644 --> 01:28:31,279
<i>475.</i>

950
01:28:33,114 --> 01:28:36,284
<i>476, 477, 478.</i>

951
01:28:40,487 --> 01:28:42,089
<i>479.</i>

952
01:28:49,931 --> 01:28:52,432
<i>Logan Ash.
A pleasure to meet you.</i>

953
01:28:52,465 --> 01:28:53,634
Oh, my God, that's him.

954
01:28:53,668 --> 01:28:55,236
<i>I am sorry</i>
<i>for your loss.</i>

955
01:28:55,269 --> 01:28:58,272
<i>I believe you know
who I represent and work for?</i>

956
01:28:58,306 --> 01:29:00,473
<i>We have an opportunity for you.</i>

957
01:29:01,441 --> 01:29:02,677
<i>You keep</i>
<i>coming back to me.</i>

958
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:04,444
<i>I thought
I'd never see you again,</i>

959
01:29:04,477 --> 01:29:06,080
<i>but fate draws
us back together.</i>

960
01:29:06,113 --> 01:29:08,316
Yes. Q's got eyes on Logan Ash.

961
01:29:09,382 --> 01:29:10,585
- Go.
- Yep.

962
01:29:10,618 --> 01:29:11,986
Let me know what happens.

963
01:29:12,019 --> 01:29:13,788
<i>Now your enemy</i>
<i>is my enemy.</i>

964
01:29:13,821 --> 01:29:15,156
How did that happen?

965
01:29:15,189 --> 01:29:17,158
Well, you live long enough...

966
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:20,094
Yeah. Look at us.

967
01:29:20,127 --> 01:29:21,494
Two old men in a hole

968
01:29:21,529 --> 01:29:23,731
trying to work out
who's playing tricks on us.

969
01:29:27,168 --> 01:29:29,971
She still loves you.
Did you know that?

970
01:29:30,004 --> 01:29:32,173
And you broke her heart.
And she betrayed you.

971
01:29:32,206 --> 01:29:33,774
She is irrelevant.

972
01:29:33,808 --> 01:29:37,178
Mm, I wouldn't be
so quick to dismiss.

973
01:29:37,211 --> 01:29:40,480
You said it yourself,
she's very good at hiding things.

974
01:29:40,514 --> 01:29:44,819
And when her secret finds its way
out, and it will,

975
01:29:44,852 --> 01:29:46,354
it'll be the death of you.

976
01:29:46,386 --> 01:29:48,488
Just give me a name.

977
01:29:48,522 --> 01:29:50,358
Madeleine.

978
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:53,493
Please, just...
Please, no games.

979
01:29:54,996 --> 01:29:56,030
Madeleine.

980
01:29:58,065 --> 01:30:00,968
Oh, do you know what?
The two of you should come see me.

981
01:30:01,002 --> 01:30:03,004
A little couples therapy.

982
01:30:03,037 --> 01:30:06,140
I simply have to see your face
when she tells you the truth.

983
01:30:06,173 --> 01:30:09,343
Just tell me
who they are, Blofeld...

984
01:30:11,379 --> 01:30:14,081
and then I'll leave.
I'll leave you on your own.

985
01:30:14,115 --> 01:30:15,983
No, I don't want you to leave.

986
01:30:16,017 --> 01:30:17,385
We're just getting
reacquainted.

987
01:30:23,958 --> 01:30:25,726
Hmm. All right. Come.

988
01:30:27,094 --> 01:30:30,497
You were unusually patient.
I need to give you something

989
01:30:30,531 --> 01:30:33,234
so that you didn't have to make
all this way for nothing. Come.

990
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:40,641
Careful, Bond.

991
01:30:41,609 --> 01:30:42,475
It was me.

992
01:30:44,412 --> 01:30:47,014
- You destroyed Spectre?
- No.

993
01:30:47,048 --> 01:30:49,016
Vesper's grave.

994
01:30:49,050 --> 01:30:51,118
Madeleine didn't do a thing.
It was all me.

995
01:30:51,152 --> 01:30:53,087
I knew you'd come visit it,

996
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,957
I just needed to wait
for the <i>bon moment.</i>

997
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:57,457
She led you straight there

998
01:30:57,490 --> 01:30:59,593
from the goodness
of her heart.

999
01:30:59,627 --> 01:31:02,596
And then you left her, for me.

1000
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:04,899
- It doesn't matter.
- Oh, but it does.

1001
01:31:04,932 --> 01:31:06,934
She still does, doesn't she?

1002
01:31:06,968 --> 01:31:09,103
My poor little cuckoo.

1003
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:13,407
You were always so very,
very sensitive.

1004
01:31:16,777 --> 01:31:17,945
<i>This isn't working.</i>

1005
01:31:17,979 --> 01:31:19,246
Keep going.

1006
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,115
<i>All this wasted time,</i>

1007
01:31:21,148 --> 01:31:22,984
the life you could have had.

1008
01:31:23,017 --> 01:31:25,987
And the reason all of this
is so beautiful,

1009
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:27,822
so exquisitely beautiful,

1010
01:31:27,855 --> 01:31:30,458
is that you're coming
to me looking for answers,

1011
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:33,493
whereas the one person
who knows it all is she.

1012
01:31:33,527 --> 01:31:36,931
It's Madeleine. She holds
the secrets you need.

1013
01:31:36,964 --> 01:31:39,667
All of them.
I didn't need to kill you.

1014
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:41,402
I'd already broken you.

1015
01:31:41,435 --> 01:31:43,704
I wanted to give you
an empty world...

1016
01:31:45,139 --> 01:31:47,341
like the one you gave me.

1017
01:31:47,375 --> 01:31:49,176
It's enough
to almost make me regret it.

1018
01:31:50,478 --> 01:31:51,645
Eh, almost.

1019
01:32:00,121 --> 01:32:00,955
Die.

1020
01:32:02,723 --> 01:32:03,624
Hmm?

1021
01:32:06,327 --> 01:32:08,429
Die, Blofeld. Die.

1022
01:32:08,462 --> 01:32:09,964
Jesus. Open the door.

1023
01:32:11,699 --> 01:32:14,168
Bond! Bond! Bond!

1024
01:32:14,201 --> 01:32:18,305
Open the door. Bond!

1025
01:32:18,339 --> 01:32:19,840
Cuckoo.

1026
01:32:19,874 --> 01:32:21,008
What the hell
are you thinking?

1027
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:22,777
Yes, yes, yes, I know how
to interrogate an asset.

1028
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:25,679
- This interrogation is over.
- Tanner, don't lecture me!

1029
01:32:25,713 --> 01:32:28,215
Bond, you have violated
the most important rule

1030
01:32:28,249 --> 01:32:29,850
in the whole bloody playbook.

1031
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:37,425
Don't move.

1032
01:32:47,668 --> 01:32:49,538
I'm... I'm gonna need those,
I'm afraid.

1033
01:33:01,550 --> 01:33:02,383
He's dead.

1034
01:33:04,852 --> 01:33:07,254
It's a good thing
you're not actually related,

1035
01:33:07,288 --> 01:33:08,355
or you'd be dead too.

1036
01:33:09,857 --> 01:33:12,193
- How do I get this off?
- Oh, you don't. You can't.

1037
01:33:14,061 --> 01:33:17,098
Nanobots aren't just
for Christmas.

1038
01:33:17,131 --> 01:33:21,302
Once Heracles is in your
system, it's there forever.

1039
01:33:26,941 --> 01:33:28,510
Did they find the car?

1040
01:33:28,543 --> 01:33:30,344
We traced it,
but she abandoned it.

1041
01:33:30,377 --> 01:33:32,713
They searched her flat,
she hasn't been home.

1042
01:33:33,981 --> 01:33:36,117
- Is she one of them?
- I don't know.

1043
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:40,221
James, do you have any idea
where she might have gone?

1044
01:33:41,889 --> 01:33:44,125
No. I don't know her at all.

1045
01:34:30,838 --> 01:34:32,373
Is that for me?

1046
01:34:34,675 --> 01:34:35,876
No.

1047
01:34:38,679 --> 01:34:40,181
Then why did you come?

1048
01:34:41,182 --> 01:34:42,651
Because you told me to.

1049
01:34:44,519 --> 01:34:47,188
I didn't think you
would remember.

1050
01:34:47,221 --> 01:34:48,923
I remember everything.

1051
01:34:48,956 --> 01:34:51,458
You need to tell me who gave
you the poison, Madeleine.

1052
01:34:53,628 --> 01:34:54,663
Is he dead?

1053
01:34:55,996 --> 01:34:57,198
Yes, he's dead.

1054
01:34:58,299 --> 01:34:59,466
Good.

1055
01:35:02,469 --> 01:35:03,638
He told me
you didn't betray me.

1056
01:35:06,040 --> 01:35:07,841
I understand you're not built
to trust people.

1057
01:35:09,710 --> 01:35:13,080
- Neither are you.
- Then we were fools for trying.

1058
01:35:14,215 --> 01:35:15,482
I wanted to.

1059
01:35:22,657 --> 01:35:24,825
I don't know if you wanted me
to come here,

1060
01:35:26,493 --> 01:35:27,962
or why you tried
to kill Blofeld,

1061
01:35:27,995 --> 01:35:29,564
or who gave you
the poison to do it,

1062
01:35:29,598 --> 01:35:30,699
or how long you've been
working for them,

1063
01:35:30,731 --> 01:35:32,233
but I do know...

1064
01:35:34,902 --> 01:35:39,473
that for what felt
like five minutes of my life

1065
01:35:39,507 --> 01:35:41,610
I wanted everything with you.

1066
01:35:44,211 --> 01:35:46,548
And it's not
because I didn't trust.

1067
01:35:49,517 --> 01:35:51,285
It was just that feeling.

1068
01:35:55,724 --> 01:35:58,560
I know I've come here to find
out who gave you the poison.

1069
01:36:00,361 --> 01:36:02,763
But I'm not going to leave here
without you knowing

1070
01:36:03,964 --> 01:36:05,734
that I have loved you,

1071
01:36:07,201 --> 01:36:09,169
and I will love you,

1072
01:36:09,203 --> 01:36:13,073
and I do not regret
a single moment of my life

1073
01:36:13,107 --> 01:36:14,375
that led me to you.

1074
01:36:17,378 --> 01:36:19,146
Except when I put you
on that train.

1075
01:36:24,151 --> 01:36:25,553
Do you know
the worst thing about you?

1076
01:36:27,821 --> 01:36:29,123
My timing?

1077
01:36:31,593 --> 01:36:32,594
Don't.

1078
01:36:41,168 --> 01:36:43,404
My sense of humor?

1079
01:36:44,805 --> 01:36:45,939
Don't.

1080
01:36:49,977 --> 01:36:52,547
- What?
- You look...

1081
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:53,981
You look incredible.

1082
01:37:06,528 --> 01:37:08,329
This is Mathilde.

1083
01:37:10,197 --> 01:37:11,465
Um...

1084
01:37:12,166 --> 01:37:13,934
Hello. I'm James.

1085
01:37:31,485 --> 01:37:35,623
Sir, we've located Logan Ash.
007 wants a word.

1086
01:37:35,657 --> 01:37:37,625
- Well done, 007.
- Thank you, sir.

1087
01:37:37,659 --> 01:37:39,360
Permission
for a capture or kill.

1088
01:37:39,393 --> 01:37:41,028
Have we cleared this
with the Americans?

1089
01:37:42,564 --> 01:37:44,666
Granted.
And thank you for asking.

1090
01:37:44,699 --> 01:37:46,634
By the book, sir.

1091
01:37:46,668 --> 01:37:48,636
Well, your predecessor
was less deferential.

1092
01:37:49,838 --> 01:37:53,440
To be fair,
Commander Bond gave me the lead.

1093
01:37:53,474 --> 01:37:56,009
Well, I'm glad to see you two
getting along.

1094
01:37:56,043 --> 01:37:57,645
<i>Sir.</i>

1095
01:37:57,679 --> 01:37:58,912
Have you located Dr. Swann?

1096
01:38:00,013 --> 01:38:01,816
Nothing, I'm afraid, sir.

1097
01:38:01,850 --> 01:38:02,883
Thank you.

1098
01:38:04,962 --> 01:38:06,547
If you hear anything what do you do?

1099
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:09,341
I hide.

1100
01:38:10,467 --> 01:38:11,719
Very good.

1101
01:38:14,513 --> 01:38:15,973
- Good night.
- Good night.

1102
01:38:16,557 --> 01:38:18,434
- Say good night.
- Good night.

1103
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:20,853
Good night.

1104
01:38:32,913 --> 01:38:34,014
She's not yours.

1105
01:38:35,850 --> 01:38:37,084
But, um, the...

1106
01:38:37,117 --> 01:38:38,553
Okay, the blue eyes, the...

1107
01:38:40,287 --> 01:38:41,523
She's not yours.

1108
01:38:43,924 --> 01:38:44,759
Okay.

1109
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:47,529
I have something to show you.

1110
01:38:51,098 --> 01:38:52,600
Another child?

1111
01:39:03,944 --> 01:39:07,047
What is it with
your dad and secret rooms?

1112
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,048
Talk to me.

1113
01:39:09,383 --> 01:39:10,752
I wanted
to bring you here before.

1114
01:39:12,286 --> 01:39:13,755
To tell you everything.

1115
01:39:15,222 --> 01:39:16,858
Blofeld ordered my father

1116
01:39:16,891 --> 01:39:18,726
to assassinate this family.

1117
01:39:18,760 --> 01:39:20,494
The boy survived.

1118
01:39:22,429 --> 01:39:23,964
His name is Lyutsifer Safin.

1119
01:39:28,068 --> 01:39:30,772
When I was a little girl,
he came here to kill my father.

1120
01:39:32,907 --> 01:39:34,809
But he found me
and my mother instead.

1121
01:39:37,311 --> 01:39:38,278
He spared my life.

1122
01:39:40,748 --> 01:39:42,382
And now he's back.

1123
01:39:42,416 --> 01:39:44,953
- And what does he want?
- Revenge.

1124
01:39:47,421 --> 01:39:48,422
Me.

1125
01:39:54,261 --> 01:39:57,097
- Who were they?
- Spectre's poisoners.

1126
01:39:57,130 --> 01:39:59,166
My father held
a banquet for them,

1127
01:39:59,199 --> 01:40:01,903
used their own recipe
in the dessert.

1128
01:40:01,936 --> 01:40:02,871
Dioxin.

1129
01:40:04,772 --> 01:40:06,741
They would have
suffered horribly.

1130
01:40:06,774 --> 01:40:08,108
Scarred him for life.

1131
01:40:09,677 --> 01:40:10,845
The family had an island.

1132
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:14,782
They called it
the Poison Garden.

1133
01:40:16,049 --> 01:40:17,519
Oh, so...

1134
01:40:17,552 --> 01:40:20,187
Blofeld took it from them,
and kept running it,

1135
01:40:21,556 --> 01:40:23,625
and now this Safin
has taken it back.

1136
01:40:29,631 --> 01:40:33,001
Q, find one Lyutsifer Safin.

1137
01:40:33,033 --> 01:40:35,435
Whereabouts unknown
and no recent photographs,

1138
01:40:35,469 --> 01:40:38,205
but I'm gonna send you
some images of him as a boy.

1139
01:40:38,238 --> 01:40:42,209
And a picture of an island.
So, you know, do your best.

1140
01:40:42,242 --> 01:40:44,846
And I'm gonna need a plane
to get there, a big one.

1141
01:40:48,883 --> 01:40:50,417
I'll send you
my location shortly.

1142
01:40:55,023 --> 01:40:56,658
You're going to find him?

1143
01:40:59,027 --> 01:41:02,362
There are a thousand reasons
why we need to find this man.

1144
01:41:04,532 --> 01:41:06,868
You just gave me a reason
to kill him.

1145
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:18,238
I'm hungry.

1146
01:41:42,570 --> 01:41:43,403
How is it?

1147
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:46,767
Not bad.

1148
01:41:57,952 --> 01:41:59,386
Excuse me.

1149
01:41:59,419 --> 01:42:00,922
- Yes?
- Bond.

1150
01:42:00,955 --> 01:42:02,422
<i>Did you find the island?</i>

1151
01:42:02,456 --> 01:42:04,626
<i>Yes, it's part of a chain</i>

1152
01:42:04,659 --> 01:42:06,894
<i>in disputed waters
between Japan and Russia.</i>

1153
01:42:06,928 --> 01:42:10,865
<i>There's a chemical plant dating
back to the Second World War,</i>

1154
01:42:10,898 --> 01:42:12,734
<i>seems to have had
quite a history.</i>

1155
01:42:12,767 --> 01:42:14,869
Sir, Japanese intelligence

1156
01:42:14,902 --> 01:42:16,904
have reported suspicious
activity on the island.

1157
01:42:16,938 --> 01:42:20,942
Q, bring up the satellite
images I just sent through.

1158
01:42:20,975 --> 01:42:22,677
These were taken
over the last few days.

1159
01:42:25,513 --> 01:42:28,482
- If that is Safin there...
- Then Heracles is there too.

1160
01:42:28,516 --> 01:42:30,051
<i>Where do you need</i>
<i>this plane, Bond?</i>

1161
01:42:30,084 --> 01:42:33,253
Hang on, Q. Did 007 manage
to locate Logan Ash?

1162
01:42:33,286 --> 01:42:35,957
She's closing in on him.
I'll send you her location.

1163
01:42:44,197 --> 01:42:46,934
I thought she was following Logan
Ash, not me.

1164
01:42:46,968 --> 01:42:48,335
<i>What? She is.</i>

1165
01:42:48,368 --> 01:42:50,203
<i>James, where are you?</i>

1166
01:42:54,842 --> 01:42:56,476
Put her in the back.

1167
01:42:57,779 --> 01:42:59,814
There you are.
In here. Watch your head.

1168
01:43:04,428 --> 01:43:05,554
Where are we going?

1169
01:43:06,471 --> 01:43:08,557
We're going on an adventure, darling.
Hang on.

1170
01:43:13,861 --> 01:43:16,631
Q, I am gonna
need that plane, quickly.

1171
01:43:16,664 --> 01:43:18,132
I'm near Orland NATO base.

1172
01:43:18,166 --> 01:43:19,499
You think
you can get it to me?

1173
01:43:19,534 --> 01:43:21,135
<i>Right. Right, yes.</i>
<i>We'll be there.</i>

1174
01:43:21,169 --> 01:43:24,072
- Thank you.
- Mama.

1175
01:43:24,948 --> 01:43:26,283
A mosquito bite me.

1176
01:43:27,117 --> 01:43:28,035
It's okay.

1177
01:43:28,118 --> 01:43:30,537
Dou Dou, do you like mosquitoes?

1178
01:43:51,058 --> 01:43:51,892
Mama.

1179
01:43:51,975 --> 01:43:55,562
- Do mosquitoes have friends?
- I don't know.

1180
01:43:59,816 --> 01:44:01,234
I don't think so.

1181
01:44:16,875 --> 01:44:18,001
Hang on.

1182
01:44:29,537 --> 01:44:30,772
James.

1183
01:44:43,918 --> 01:44:45,285
Mathilde!

1184
01:45:54,354 --> 01:45:55,189
They're above us!

1185
01:46:23,184 --> 01:46:25,186
Get out of here! James!

1186
01:48:02,817 --> 01:48:03,985
You stay here.

1187
01:48:04,785 --> 01:48:07,088
I'll be back soon.

1188
01:48:07,121 --> 01:48:09,724
Anybody comes through
that door, you shoot them.

1189
01:48:09,757 --> 01:48:10,791
Unless it's me.

1190
01:48:12,492 --> 01:48:14,428
You be quiet, okay?
Stay really quiet.

1191
01:49:30,704 --> 01:49:31,939
Hey!

1192
01:49:47,421 --> 01:49:48,456
Go! Go!

1193
01:49:55,429 --> 01:49:56,263
There! Run him over!

1194
01:50:24,158 --> 01:50:26,127
Nice moves, Bond.

1195
01:50:27,562 --> 01:50:29,564
You won't be able
to stop him...

1196
01:50:32,066 --> 01:50:34,401
...so why don't you help
me out, brother?

1197
01:50:34,435 --> 01:50:35,570
I had a brother.

1198
01:50:38,105 --> 01:50:39,473
His name was Felix Leiter.

1199
01:52:02,189 --> 01:52:03,057
Need a ride?

1200
01:52:04,526 --> 01:52:06,126
Where have you been?

1201
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:08,362
Chasing after your lead.

1202
01:52:11,700 --> 01:52:13,901
- Ash?
- Dead.

1203
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:18,172
They took Dr. Swann.

1204
01:52:19,273 --> 01:52:20,508
And her daughter.

1205
01:52:22,910 --> 01:52:26,180
I... I didn't know
she had a daughter.

1206
01:52:26,213 --> 01:52:27,549
Did M get my plane?

1207
01:52:28,949 --> 01:52:31,452
Our plane.
I'm coming with you.

1208
01:52:34,255 --> 01:52:35,724
Thank you, 007.

1209
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:01,716
- Hello, Q.
- Bond.

1210
01:53:03,417 --> 01:53:04,753
Sorry to get you
out of bed.

1211
01:53:06,987 --> 01:53:09,758
<i>The objectives</i>
<i>of this mission are threefold.</i>

1212
01:53:09,790 --> 01:53:11,959
<i>Confirm the presence
of Heracles.</i>

1213
01:53:11,992 --> 01:53:13,961
<i>Kill Obruchev and Safin.</i>

1214
01:53:13,994 --> 01:53:17,097
<i>Get Dr. Swann and her daughter
off the island.</i>

1215
01:53:17,131 --> 01:53:19,967
<i>And, Bond,
I hope they're there.</i>

1216
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,469
- Thank you, sir.
- Sir.

1217
01:53:24,673 --> 01:53:27,941
Permission for Commander Bond
to be redesignated as 007.

1218
01:53:31,078 --> 01:53:32,246
It's just a number.

1219
01:53:32,279 --> 01:53:33,914
<i>Very well. Agreed.</i>

1220
01:53:35,449 --> 01:53:36,817
<i>Good luck.</i>

1221
01:53:36,850 --> 01:53:38,520
Bond, your watch.

1222
01:53:41,455 --> 01:53:45,593
It contains a limited-radius
electromagnetic pulse.

1223
01:53:45,627 --> 01:53:47,928
It'll short any circuit
in a hardwired network

1224
01:53:47,961 --> 01:53:49,631
- if you get close enough.
- Mm-hmm.

1225
01:53:51,465 --> 01:53:52,667
And how strong is it?

1226
01:53:53,635 --> 01:53:56,070
It's fairly strong.

1227
01:53:56,103 --> 01:53:57,572
"Fairly strong,"
what's that mean?

1228
01:53:57,605 --> 01:53:59,808
We haven't had the chance to test
it properly, just be careful.

1229
01:54:00,974 --> 01:54:03,143
Right, this is Q-DAR.

1230
01:54:03,177 --> 01:54:04,813
It will map the space
as you move through it.

1231
01:54:07,682 --> 01:54:08,616
Don't touch that.

1232
01:54:10,184 --> 01:54:13,187
And smart blood
will track you...

1233
01:54:13,220 --> 01:54:15,189
Whoops. And your vitals.

1234
01:54:21,995 --> 01:54:24,766
Bond, you don't mind a
shot or two whilst at work?

1235
01:54:24,799 --> 01:54:26,367
- Shall we?
- Well, I haven't had a drink

1236
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:27,868
for three or four hou...

1237
01:54:27,901 --> 01:54:29,604
- Hours.
- Wow.

1238
01:54:29,637 --> 01:54:32,506
Doesn't sound like you.

1239
01:54:35,075 --> 01:54:37,277
- Ow!
- Good.

1240
01:54:37,311 --> 01:54:38,979
I assume you know
how the stealthy bird works.

1241
01:54:39,012 --> 01:54:40,582
No, no idea.

1242
01:54:41,382 --> 01:54:42,383
Gravity.

1243
01:55:02,837 --> 01:55:04,606
Welcome back, Mr. Safin.

1244
01:55:05,540 --> 01:55:07,675
Welcome to your family.

1245
01:55:07,709 --> 01:55:09,309
How are you progressing?

1246
01:55:09,343 --> 01:55:11,378
So, so good, Mr. Safin.
So, so good.

1247
01:55:11,412 --> 01:55:14,849
- My request?
- Svetlana?

1248
01:55:23,390 --> 01:55:25,492
Continue.

1249
01:55:25,527 --> 01:55:27,662
- What is that?
- Insurance.

1250
01:55:27,695 --> 01:55:29,930
A simple hair falls
from your head

1251
01:55:29,963 --> 01:55:31,566
and now I have your life
in my hands.

1252
01:55:33,934 --> 01:55:35,068
And yours.

1253
01:55:36,905 --> 01:55:39,774
How damaged you must be
to threaten a little girl.

1254
01:55:41,408 --> 01:55:43,310
You're any less damaged?

1255
01:55:44,746 --> 01:55:46,046
You love a killer.

1256
01:55:47,916 --> 01:55:51,553
You bore his child
despite his rejection.

1257
01:55:51,586 --> 01:55:53,755
You've hidden
and lied your whole life.

1258
01:55:53,788 --> 01:55:56,223
You will do anything...

1259
01:55:56,256 --> 01:55:57,257
To survive.

1260
01:56:01,495 --> 01:56:03,765
You understand me
the same way I understand you.

1261
01:56:07,334 --> 01:56:08,168
Move.

1262
01:56:18,145 --> 01:56:19,781
My father's garden.

1263
01:56:19,814 --> 01:56:22,550
It was his toxic treasure.

1264
01:56:22,584 --> 01:56:24,652
Let me show her.

1265
01:56:24,686 --> 01:56:27,087
- Give her to me.
- No.

1266
01:56:29,289 --> 01:56:30,692
I can protect her.

1267
01:56:34,762 --> 01:56:36,096
Mathilde.

1268
01:56:36,150 --> 01:56:39,117
Remember what I told you.
Don't touch anything. Okay?

1269
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:47,074
Mathilde.

1270
01:56:47,107 --> 01:56:48,943
It's a poison garden...

1271
01:56:50,377 --> 01:56:52,312
but it's perfectly safe.

1272
01:56:54,649 --> 01:56:56,784
My father made this.

1273
01:56:56,818 --> 01:57:00,522
He loved his plants so much,
he would sing to them.

1274
01:57:03,825 --> 01:57:05,627
I want to show you
one of my favorites.

1275
01:57:09,797 --> 01:57:12,600
Some of these plants
are very dangerous,

1276
01:57:12,634 --> 01:57:15,003
but not all of them
are for hurting people.

1277
01:57:15,035 --> 01:57:17,906
I have plants that can do
all sorts of things.

1278
01:57:24,746 --> 01:57:25,914
Mathilde!

1279
01:57:27,247 --> 01:57:28,081
No.

1280
01:57:29,584 --> 01:57:31,485
This one makes you do
as you're told,

1281
01:57:32,887 --> 01:57:34,388
so you never misbehave,

1282
01:57:34,421 --> 01:57:36,056
and you're always good.

1283
01:57:36,089 --> 01:57:38,058
You mustn't misbehave,
Mathilde.

1284
01:57:39,594 --> 01:57:41,161
And neither must your mother.

1285
01:57:43,831 --> 01:57:44,832
Ever.

1286
01:57:48,335 --> 01:57:50,504
- Do you like it here?
- No.

1287
01:57:51,873 --> 01:57:53,007
Well, you will learn to.

1288
01:57:54,207 --> 01:57:55,208
I grew up here,

1289
01:57:55,242 --> 01:57:56,410
and you will too.

1290
01:58:00,582 --> 01:58:02,249
Such a beautiful child.

1291
01:58:05,218 --> 01:58:06,688
Perhaps we should
have some tea.

1292
01:58:06,721 --> 01:58:08,355
- No.
- Make her see the light.

1293
01:58:08,388 --> 01:58:10,223
No,
you can't separate us!

1294
01:58:10,257 --> 01:58:11,391
- Mathilde!
- Mama!

1295
01:58:11,417 --> 01:58:14,837
Remember what I told you.
I'll come looking for you. Okay?

1296
01:58:17,130 --> 01:58:18,066
Don't worry.

1297
01:58:20,635 --> 01:58:21,636
You have me.

1298
01:58:31,378 --> 01:58:33,413
<i>As soon as you have</i>
<i>a line of sight on the island,</i>

1299
01:58:33,447 --> 01:58:35,449
<i>drop altitude,
stay below radar.</i>

1300
01:58:40,454 --> 01:58:41,889
You ever flown
one of these things before?

1301
01:58:43,323 --> 01:58:44,424
Nope.

1302
01:58:51,298 --> 01:58:53,133
<i>Don't forget</i>
<i>to release the chute,</i>

1303
01:58:53,166 --> 01:58:54,769
<i>and open the wings.</i>

1304
01:58:54,802 --> 01:58:55,970
<i>Gravity isn't always
your friend.</i>

1305
01:59:12,754 --> 01:59:15,188
<i>Look for a concrete structure
on the west side of the island.</i>

1306
01:59:16,256 --> 01:59:17,692
<i>That's your best bet
for getting in.</i>

1307
02:00:04,204 --> 02:00:06,607
Coming up for air, Q.

1308
02:00:06,641 --> 02:00:08,208
Right, good.

1309
02:00:08,241 --> 02:00:11,145
You should be entering
a World War II-era sub pen.

1310
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:14,115
<i>Doesn't seem
to get much activity,</i>

1311
02:00:14,148 --> 02:00:15,650
<i>but look out
for cameras anyway.</i>

1312
02:00:16,851 --> 02:00:18,152
<i>Use your watch, Bond.</i>

1313
02:00:29,221 --> 02:00:31,474
- What's going on?
- It's the equipment.

1314
02:00:32,058 --> 02:00:33,517
The cameras are down.

1315
02:00:34,435 --> 02:00:35,645
The whole lower sector.

1316
02:00:35,728 --> 02:00:38,022
I'll restart the system.

1317
02:00:53,621 --> 02:00:55,355
Okay. Ah, there you go.

1318
02:00:56,691 --> 02:00:59,727
- <i>Sir, they're in.</i>
- Yes, we have it.

1319
02:00:59,761 --> 02:01:02,230
<i>You should be able to see the
chemical plant's architecture.</i>

1320
02:01:02,262 --> 02:01:05,298
- Which one's Bond?
- <i>He's the... He's the psi.</i>

1321
02:01:05,332 --> 02:01:08,770
- <i>He's the trident thingy.</i>
- <i>Give us the layout.</i>

1322
02:01:08,803 --> 02:01:11,271
Right.

1323
02:01:11,304 --> 02:01:14,776
You're at the edge
of a toxic merry-go-round.

1324
02:01:14,809 --> 02:01:17,912
<i>The main activity should
be towards the central hub,</i>

1325
02:01:17,945 --> 02:01:19,046
<i>which is directly above you.</i>

1326
02:01:52,747 --> 02:01:54,248
Bond.

1327
02:01:54,282 --> 02:01:55,983
Bond, there's something...

1328
02:01:56,017 --> 02:01:57,618
There's something
big up ahead,

1329
02:01:57,652 --> 02:01:59,120
<i>I can't work out what it is.
It's...</i>

1330
02:02:00,588 --> 02:02:01,689
These walls
must be thick.

1331
02:02:08,296 --> 02:02:09,197
Bond.

1332
02:02:10,665 --> 02:02:12,834
<i>Bond? 007, do you read me?</i>

1333
02:02:12,867 --> 02:02:14,936
We've lost them.

1334
02:02:14,969 --> 02:02:16,771
They've entered
a blind spot, sir.

1335
02:02:16,804 --> 02:02:18,840
<i>I can't work out what it is
they've walked into.</i>

1336
02:02:18,873 --> 02:02:20,241
Well, just get them back.

1337
02:02:53,373 --> 02:02:55,309
Well,
will you look at those doors.

1338
02:02:56,310 --> 02:02:57,945
This was a missile silo.

1339
02:02:57,979 --> 02:02:58,980
Right.

1340
02:03:01,015 --> 02:03:02,149
Let's go.

1341
02:03:09,590 --> 02:03:11,993
Everybody, over there!
In the corner! Now!

1342
02:03:12,026 --> 02:03:14,528
- What? How?
- Move!

1343
02:03:14,562 --> 02:03:16,230
Move! On the ground!

1344
02:03:18,165 --> 02:03:19,967
Alarm.

1345
02:03:21,535 --> 02:03:22,770
Down, boy.

1346
02:03:39,921 --> 02:03:42,422
What... What are you doing?

1347
02:03:42,455 --> 02:03:45,993
You cannot explode
laboratory, please.

1348
02:03:49,897 --> 02:03:54,035
This is suicide mission.
Come on.

1349
02:03:54,068 --> 02:03:56,370
You will never leave
this island alive.

1350
02:04:03,044 --> 02:04:03,978
That was the farm.

1351
02:04:05,445 --> 02:04:07,148
And this is the factory.

1352
02:04:20,294 --> 02:04:21,762
They're mass-producing it.

1353
02:04:21,796 --> 02:04:23,197
Nomi, come and look at this.

1354
02:04:23,230 --> 02:04:25,800
Well, look,
you cannot stop it, mister.

1355
02:04:25,833 --> 02:04:28,269
We have big plan, you know.

1356
02:04:28,302 --> 02:04:29,704
- We have big numbers.
- What is it?

1357
02:04:29,737 --> 02:04:31,305
It's a simulation.

1358
02:04:31,339 --> 02:04:33,107
They're not
just attacking individuals.

1359
02:04:33,140 --> 02:04:35,076
They're going to kill millions.

1360
02:04:35,109 --> 02:04:37,645
It will not fit
in a suitcase this time, lady.

1361
02:04:37,678 --> 02:04:39,880
He's really getting
on my nerves.

1362
02:04:39,914 --> 02:04:40,781
Well, shut him up.

1363
02:04:42,516 --> 02:04:45,152
Ow!

1364
02:04:45,186 --> 02:04:46,821
My nose.

1365
02:04:50,157 --> 02:04:53,227
We have
to destroy this whole facility.

1366
02:04:53,260 --> 02:04:54,729
<i>There is no need for violence.</i>

1367
02:04:54,762 --> 02:04:57,064
Mr. Safin,
they use explosives.

1368
02:04:57,098 --> 02:04:59,266
- Shut up.
- <i>Mr. Bond,</i>

1369
02:05:00,768 --> 02:05:04,472
<i>you have something of mine
and I have something of yours.</i>

1370
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:08,809
<i>Why don't you come up
and we can talk about it?</i>

1371
02:05:08,843 --> 02:05:09,944
<i>Like adults.</i>

1372
02:05:12,646 --> 02:05:14,281
Safin, where is he?

1373
02:05:19,887 --> 02:05:21,389
If I don't come back,

1374
02:05:22,857 --> 02:05:24,158
blow it all to shit.

1375
02:05:25,159 --> 02:05:26,494
We don't have enough
explosives for that.

1376
02:05:26,527 --> 02:05:28,462
Yeah, but they don't know that.

1377
02:05:31,532 --> 02:05:32,366
Huh.

1378
02:05:47,214 --> 02:05:49,116
He said you must drink.

1379
02:05:49,150 --> 02:05:51,218
- For your health.
- Do you trust him?

1380
02:05:51,252 --> 02:05:54,188
He made me kill
your last master.

1381
02:05:54,221 --> 02:05:56,290
Why do you think
he let you join him?

1382
02:05:56,323 --> 02:05:59,493
I think he wants you to drink.

1383
02:06:02,163 --> 02:06:04,899
I want him to give me
my daughter back.

1384
02:06:04,932 --> 02:06:08,202
He said if you behave,
you'll see her. Drink.

1385
02:06:18,712 --> 02:06:20,214
Do you know
what this flower does?

1386
02:06:26,220 --> 02:06:27,522
It makes you blind.

1387
02:06:29,056 --> 02:06:31,158
Just a drop of this
in your eye,

1388
02:06:31,192 --> 02:06:32,527
and you'll never see again.

1389
02:06:35,229 --> 02:06:37,064
Losing one eye is a tragedy.

1390
02:06:37,098 --> 02:06:38,533
Losing two...

1391
02:06:38,567 --> 02:06:40,701
- No games.
- This is not a game.

1392
02:07:19,807 --> 02:07:20,641
Welcome.

1393
02:07:22,643 --> 02:07:23,477
On the floor.

1394
02:07:32,686 --> 02:07:33,787
Your sidearm.

1395
02:07:35,590 --> 02:07:36,423
Careful.

1396
02:07:41,862 --> 02:07:44,431
- She is light as a feather.
- All right!

1397
02:07:55,843 --> 02:07:56,810
Please, sit.

1398
02:08:03,684 --> 02:08:05,319
It's going to be all right.

1399
02:08:05,352 --> 02:08:07,388
Promise you,
it's going to be all right.

1400
02:08:08,389 --> 02:08:10,592
James Bond.

1401
02:08:10,625 --> 02:08:12,960
History of violence.

1402
02:08:12,993 --> 02:08:14,629
License to kill.

1403
02:08:15,696 --> 02:08:18,199
Vendetta with Ernst Blofeld.

1404
02:08:18,232 --> 02:08:20,201
In love with Madeleine Swann.

1405
02:08:22,303 --> 02:08:24,639
I could be speaking
to my own reflection.

1406
02:08:24,673 --> 02:08:26,608
We've made
slightly different choices.

1407
02:08:26,641 --> 02:08:30,645
No. We've just developed different
methods for the same goal.

1408
02:08:32,179 --> 02:08:35,115
Only your skills die
with your body.

1409
02:08:35,149 --> 02:08:37,652
Mine will survive
long after I'm gone.

1410
02:08:38,719 --> 02:08:41,922
And life is all about
leaving something behind.

1411
02:08:44,358 --> 02:08:45,226
Isn't it?

1412
02:08:46,760 --> 02:08:48,495
Doesn't have to be ugly.

1413
02:08:49,930 --> 02:08:52,534
You leave my baby alone,
I leave yours.

1414
02:08:52,567 --> 02:08:53,702
What do you think?

1415
02:08:57,004 --> 02:08:59,106
I think you're right.

1416
02:09:00,908 --> 02:09:02,042
Thank you.

1417
02:09:02,076 --> 02:09:03,511
I think we are the same.

1418
02:09:04,745 --> 02:09:06,313
We both know
what it feels like

1419
02:09:06,347 --> 02:09:08,749
to have everything
taken from us

1420
02:09:08,782 --> 02:09:11,553
before we're even
in the fight.

1421
02:09:11,586 --> 02:09:16,524
It would have been nice
to have a chance,

1422
02:09:16,558 --> 02:09:18,425
you know, don't you think?

1423
02:09:18,459 --> 02:09:21,663
Just...
we all should get a chance.

1424
02:09:21,696 --> 02:09:24,331
But this thing
that you're building,

1425
02:09:24,365 --> 02:09:26,534
it puts everyone,

1426
02:09:26,568 --> 02:09:29,103
the whole world
on a battlefield.

1427
02:09:29,136 --> 02:09:31,205
Nobody gets a chance.

1428
02:09:34,542 --> 02:09:37,612
The thing
that no one wants to admit

1429
02:09:37,646 --> 02:09:41,849
is that most people want things
to happen to them.

1430
02:09:41,882 --> 02:09:45,286
We tell each other lies
about the fight for free will

1431
02:09:45,319 --> 02:09:46,755
and independence,

1432
02:09:46,787 --> 02:09:50,257
but we don't really want that.

1433
02:09:50,291 --> 02:09:51,959
We want to be told how to live,

1434
02:09:53,494 --> 02:09:55,496
and then die
when we are not looking.

1435
02:09:57,131 --> 02:10:00,000
People want oblivion,

1436
02:10:01,268 --> 02:10:04,639
and a few of us are born
to build it for them.

1437
02:10:06,775 --> 02:10:10,679
So, here I am,
their invisible god...

1438
02:10:12,681 --> 02:10:16,383
sneaking under their skin.

1439
02:10:16,417 --> 02:10:19,219
You know that history isn't
kind to those who play God.

1440
02:10:19,253 --> 02:10:20,187
And you don't?

1441
02:10:22,089 --> 02:10:27,161
We both eradicate people to
make the world a better place.

1442
02:10:27,194 --> 02:10:32,333
I just want to be
a little... tidier.

1443
02:10:32,366 --> 02:10:35,436
Without collateral.

1444
02:10:35,469 --> 02:10:37,806
I want the world to evolve,

1445
02:10:37,838 --> 02:10:39,674
yet you want it
to stay the same.

1446
02:10:41,008 --> 02:10:42,042
Let's face it...

1447
02:10:45,513 --> 02:10:48,949
- I've made you redundant.
- No.

1448
02:10:48,982 --> 02:10:51,285
Not as long as there are
people like you in the world.

1449
02:10:53,187 --> 02:10:56,725
And with all due respect
to the enormity of your...

1450
02:10:57,792 --> 02:10:59,159
tidy achievements,

1451
02:11:00,461 --> 02:11:03,330
all you're really doing is
standing in a very long line

1452
02:11:03,364 --> 02:11:05,533
of angry little men.

1453
02:11:05,567 --> 02:11:09,370
I'm not angry,
just passionate.

1454
02:11:11,038 --> 02:11:13,775
Disable your explosives,
get off my island,

1455
02:11:13,808 --> 02:11:17,478
and you can take this precious
little angel with you.

1456
02:11:19,213 --> 02:11:20,080
And Madeleine?

1457
02:11:22,149 --> 02:11:24,719
- She stays.
- You know I can't do that.

1458
02:11:25,854 --> 02:11:27,589
That is a shame.

1459
02:11:29,156 --> 02:11:30,825
She really hoped you would.

1460
02:11:31,693 --> 02:11:34,027
She knows
it's her only path to survive.

1461
02:11:34,061 --> 02:11:36,865
No, you have her tell me that.

1462
02:11:36,897 --> 02:11:41,101
What mother wouldn't sacrifice
herself for her own child?

1463
02:11:43,538 --> 02:11:44,839
Is that what happened to yours?

1464
02:11:51,111 --> 02:11:53,748
My mother lay at my feet
as I watched her die.

1465
02:11:57,752 --> 02:11:59,086
Wait! Wait. Wait.

1466
02:12:03,424 --> 02:12:04,726
I'll do whatever you want.

1467
02:12:04,759 --> 02:12:05,794
Yes, you will.

1468
02:12:09,229 --> 02:12:10,865
I... I apologize.

1469
02:12:14,301 --> 02:12:15,570
I'm sorry.

1470
02:12:16,538 --> 02:12:18,372
Simple choices, Mr. Bond.

1471
02:12:19,741 --> 02:12:22,042
Like do you want to die
in front of your daughter?

1472
02:12:23,977 --> 02:12:25,914
Or do you want your daughter
to die in front of you?

1473
02:12:25,946 --> 02:12:27,816
No. No. No. No. No.

1474
02:12:30,451 --> 02:12:31,719
I am sorry.

1475
02:12:33,655 --> 02:12:34,889
I'm sorry.

1476
02:12:36,658 --> 02:12:38,292
Look at your father, Mathilde.

1477
02:12:42,162 --> 02:12:43,430
This is power.

1478
02:12:43,464 --> 02:12:44,498
I'm sorry.

1479
02:12:45,332 --> 02:12:48,168
I'm truly, truly sorry.

1480
02:12:57,978 --> 02:12:59,146
James!

1481
02:13:00,414 --> 02:13:02,416
Where is she?

1482
02:13:05,753 --> 02:13:07,120
The first shipment
is on the dock,

1483
02:13:07,154 --> 02:13:09,122
- ready for pickup, Doctor.
- Very good.

1484
02:13:10,440 --> 02:13:11,483
My Dou Dou.

1485
02:13:27,976 --> 02:13:29,777
Hmm...

1486
02:13:31,779 --> 02:13:33,948
If you don't want
my protection, then...

1487
02:13:35,617 --> 02:13:36,818
off you go.

1488
02:13:47,160 --> 02:13:49,831
Move.
Our first buyers are arriving.

1489
02:14:03,210 --> 02:14:06,446
Sir, I've just detected
some suspicious activity.

1490
02:14:06,480 --> 02:14:09,149
<i>Several high-speed transports
are headed towards the island.</i>

1491
02:14:09,182 --> 02:14:10,652
<i>Origin unknown.</i>

1492
02:14:10,685 --> 02:14:11,553
<i>Still no sign of 007.</i>

1493
02:14:13,821 --> 02:14:17,057
Come on, Bond.
Where the hell are you?

1494
02:14:17,090 --> 02:14:20,394
This is hopeless situation,
lady. Please.

1495
02:14:23,031 --> 02:14:24,464
Bond.

1496
02:14:24,498 --> 02:14:27,501
Bond.

1497
02:14:27,535 --> 02:14:30,004
The party is larger
than the reservation.

1498
02:14:30,038 --> 02:14:32,874
Look, lady,
please, please just let me go.

1499
02:14:32,907 --> 02:14:36,109
I... There was never
gonna be a way out.

1500
02:14:37,244 --> 02:14:38,312
Stop this nonsense.

1501
02:14:38,345 --> 02:14:40,648
You don't have a chance,
anyways.

1502
02:14:42,282 --> 02:14:45,653
Hey. Hey, I have a good vial
for your people,

1503
02:14:45,687 --> 02:14:47,789
good for West African diaspora.
It can be a good thing.

1504
02:15:04,806 --> 02:15:07,341
You know,
I do not need laboratory

1505
02:15:07,374 --> 02:15:09,944
to exterminate your entire race
from the face of the Earth.

1506
02:15:11,879 --> 02:15:14,114
- Do you know what time it is?
- What?

1507
02:15:14,147 --> 02:15:15,917
Time to die.

1508
02:15:15,950 --> 02:15:18,251
No!

1509
02:15:28,096 --> 02:15:29,631
Move! Move!

1510
02:15:34,301 --> 02:15:35,870
They dropped down
to a lower level.

1511
02:15:35,903 --> 02:15:37,437
There has to be
a stairwell down.

1512
02:15:37,471 --> 02:15:38,438
Mama?

1513
02:15:42,884 --> 02:15:44,427
I lost my little Dou Dou.

1514
02:15:47,481 --> 02:15:49,083
Mathilde. Mathilde.

1515
02:15:52,602 --> 02:15:55,939
I looked for you all over. Where were you?

1516
02:15:56,022 --> 02:15:58,233
I hid like you told me.

1517
02:16:00,318 --> 02:16:01,820
I love you.

1518
02:16:02,320 --> 02:16:04,071
Me too. I love you.

1519
02:16:04,126 --> 02:16:05,471
We should go.

1520
02:16:07,234 --> 02:16:08,970
It's Q. Do you read me?

1521
02:16:10,437 --> 02:16:11,806
Come in, 007, it's Q.

1522
02:16:17,210 --> 02:16:19,113
<i>Traffic. We have traffic.</i>

1523
02:16:19,147 --> 02:16:21,849
- I think we just got buzzed.
- <i>Those are two Russian MiGs.</i>

1524
02:16:21,883 --> 02:16:23,618
<i>Traffic. TCAS,
you have control.</i>

1525
02:16:23,651 --> 02:16:25,285
I understand, and I'm doing
the best that I can.

1526
02:16:25,318 --> 02:16:27,421
Just please wait.

1527
02:16:27,454 --> 02:16:29,590
Sir, I've got the Navy,

1528
02:16:29,624 --> 02:16:31,491
the Japanese, the Russians,
all breathing down my neck,

1529
02:16:31,526 --> 02:16:33,928
demanding to know why
we've got a C-17

1530
02:16:33,961 --> 02:16:35,295
circling a disputed island.

1531
02:16:38,900 --> 02:16:40,367
Don't tell them
anything just yet.

1532
02:16:59,419 --> 02:17:02,090
- Ah, just in time.
- Nomi, you know...

1533
02:17:03,191 --> 02:17:05,827
Madeleine, Mathilde,
they're my, uh...

1534
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:07,028
- Hey.
- Hi.

1535
02:17:07,061 --> 02:17:08,062
Family?

1536
02:17:10,430 --> 02:17:12,567
<i>Q. Q, are you there?</i>

1537
02:17:12,600 --> 02:17:13,968
Yes. Bond.

1538
02:17:14,001 --> 02:17:17,038
Do we have
any Royal Naval vessels

1539
02:17:17,071 --> 02:17:20,373
- in the immediate vicinity?
- Uh, yes. Why?

1540
02:17:20,407 --> 02:17:22,710
<i>We are gonna need an immediate
strike on this location.</i>

1541
02:17:22,744 --> 02:17:24,545
<i>This whole island,</i>

1542
02:17:24,579 --> 02:17:27,347
<i>it's a manufacturing plant
for Heracles.</i>

1543
02:17:27,380 --> 02:17:29,416
We don't have clearance
for missile strikes, do we?

1544
02:17:29,449 --> 02:17:31,351
Mm-mm.

1545
02:17:31,384 --> 02:17:33,487
Bond, there's something
else you should know.

1546
02:17:33,521 --> 02:17:36,691
<i>Several unidentified ships
are headed your way.</i>

1547
02:17:36,724 --> 02:17:39,160
They're coming after Heracles.
How far out?

1548
02:17:39,193 --> 02:17:40,460
<i>Uh, 20 minutes.</i>

1549
02:17:41,696 --> 02:17:43,263
Q, patch me through.

1550
02:17:44,431 --> 02:17:46,366
- <i>007.</i>
- M.

1551
02:17:46,399 --> 02:17:50,238
<i>Our operation is attracting a
lot of international attention.</i>

1552
02:17:50,270 --> 02:17:51,539
<i>We're seeing what we can do.</i>

1553
02:17:51,572 --> 02:17:52,472
Come on.

1554
02:17:54,041 --> 02:17:55,375
Let's go. Come on.

1555
02:18:02,550 --> 02:18:05,653
It's going to get
very cold out there, so...

1556
02:18:06,888 --> 02:18:08,656
I want you to have this.

1557
02:18:10,892 --> 02:18:11,893
That'll keep you warm.

1558
02:18:17,231 --> 02:18:19,801
I have to finish this. For us.

1559
02:18:20,935 --> 02:18:22,136
I know.

1560
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:33,446
I'll just be a minute.

1561
02:18:40,655 --> 02:18:41,622
I've got them.

1562
02:18:43,257 --> 02:18:44,258
This might come in handy.

1563
02:18:45,526 --> 02:18:47,261
Thank you.

1564
02:19:09,684 --> 02:19:11,652
Q, talk to me.

1565
02:19:11,686 --> 02:19:15,089
<i>Um, our uninvited guests</i>
<i>are 15 minutes away.</i>

1566
02:19:15,122 --> 02:19:19,594
<i>Bond, M here. The situation</i>
<i>is diplomatically complex.</i>

1567
02:19:19,627 --> 02:19:22,697
We don't have a choice.
Fire on my mark.

1568
02:19:22,730 --> 02:19:25,299
<i>If we launch,</i>
<i>the Russians, the Japanese</i>

1569
02:19:25,333 --> 02:19:27,268
<i>and even the Americans
will want answers.</i>

1570
02:19:27,301 --> 02:19:28,569
Well, don't give them any.

1571
02:19:31,572 --> 02:19:33,774
<i>Rational minds, Bond.</i>

1572
02:19:33,808 --> 02:19:35,810
<i>I'm trying to save this from
escalating to all-out war.</i>

1573
02:19:37,477 --> 02:19:40,348
Mallory, if we don't do this,

1574
02:19:40,380 --> 02:19:41,716
there will be nothing
left to save.

1575
02:19:43,751 --> 02:19:45,987
Fire on my mark.

1576
02:19:46,020 --> 02:19:47,387
<i>007,</i>
<i>there's another problem.</i>

1577
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:49,557
- <i>That room you were just in.</i>
- Yes, I know, I know.

1578
02:19:49,590 --> 02:19:51,325
I've got
to open the blast doors.

1579
02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:52,994
Otherwise our missiles
will bounce off it

1580
02:19:53,027 --> 02:19:54,795
like they've hit a trampoline.

1581
02:19:54,829 --> 02:19:56,230
Yes, I know, I know.

1582
02:19:57,865 --> 02:20:00,167
Find the control room.
It should be in a tower

1583
02:20:00,201 --> 02:20:01,969
just above the blast doors.

1584
02:20:02,003 --> 02:20:04,739
The missiles will take about
nine minutes from launch.

1585
02:20:04,772 --> 02:20:06,473
<i>Do you think you can do it
before the ships arrive?</i>

1586
02:20:06,506 --> 02:20:08,376
<i>Plenty of time,</i>
<i>plenty of time.</i>

1587
02:23:25,039 --> 02:23:27,542
<i>Bond.</i>
<i>Bond, do you read me?</i>

1588
02:23:29,043 --> 02:23:31,546
Yeah.

1589
02:23:31,580 --> 02:23:32,780
Yeah, Q.

1590
02:23:32,813 --> 02:23:33,914
<i>I read you.</i>

1591
02:23:33,948 --> 02:23:35,749
Sounds like
you're in a rugby scrum.

1592
02:23:35,783 --> 02:23:37,384
I just showed someone
your watch.

1593
02:23:39,153 --> 02:23:40,754
Really blew their mind.

1594
02:23:42,656 --> 02:23:45,826
Right, good.
Now, did you find the control room?

1595
02:23:47,895 --> 02:23:50,565
Well, my Russian is a little
rusty, but I think so, yeah.

1596
02:24:04,345 --> 02:24:05,946
Okay, Q.

1597
02:24:05,980 --> 02:24:07,882
<i>Uh,</i>
<i>I've done some research.</i>

1598
02:24:07,915 --> 02:24:10,451
- <i>Old schematics...</i>
- Q, I am gonna need some...

1599
02:24:10,484 --> 02:24:11,418
<i>Yes?</i>

1600
02:24:12,686 --> 02:24:14,088
<i>Bond?</i>

1601
02:24:17,024 --> 02:24:19,059
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Power.

1602
02:24:19,093 --> 02:24:20,961
<i>Power?</i>

1603
02:24:20,995 --> 02:24:22,830
<i>Right, the infrastructure
must go back to the 1950s,</i>

1604
02:24:22,863 --> 02:24:24,398
so it's going to be
an overly complicated

1605
02:24:24,431 --> 02:24:26,233
and intricate
switching system.

1606
02:24:26,267 --> 02:24:29,270
<i>Now, the order
in which you engage it</i>

1607
02:24:29,303 --> 02:24:30,804
will need to be
extremely precise.

1608
02:24:30,838 --> 02:24:33,841
<i>You're looking
for a control panel.</i>

1609
02:24:33,874 --> 02:24:37,278
<i>There should be
a counterweight clutch.</i>

1610
02:24:37,311 --> 02:24:38,812
<i>So, listen very carefully, 007.</i>

1611
02:24:38,846 --> 02:24:40,247
<i>The first thing
you need to do...</i>

1612
02:24:40,281 --> 02:24:41,616
Got it.

1613
02:24:42,850 --> 02:24:43,784
I think.

1614
02:24:58,065 --> 02:24:59,700
Yep, that's it.
Launch the missiles.

1615
02:24:59,733 --> 02:25:01,302
<i>Not until you're clear.</i>

1616
02:25:01,335 --> 02:25:03,204
Q, tell M
to launch the missiles now.

1617
02:25:04,505 --> 02:25:07,841
Okay. Okay, okay.
Understood.

1618
02:25:07,875 --> 02:25:09,877
M, Bond says fire.

1619
02:25:11,513 --> 02:25:13,214
<i>HMS Dragon here.</i>

1620
02:25:13,247 --> 02:25:14,848
- Admiral.
- <i>Sir.</i>

1621
02:25:16,250 --> 02:25:19,486
- M here.
- <i>What are my instructions?</i>

1622
02:25:19,521 --> 02:25:21,523
You have permission to launch.

1623
02:25:21,556 --> 02:25:23,224
<i>Roger. Launching the strike.</i>

1624
02:25:37,271 --> 02:25:40,174
<i>Missiles airborne.</i>
<i>Nine minutes out.</i>

1625
02:26:08,769 --> 02:26:10,572
No.

1626
02:26:12,039 --> 02:26:13,575
No. No, no!

1627
02:26:46,273 --> 02:26:50,044
Quite a mess you've made.
Like an animal.

1628
02:27:18,872 --> 02:27:24,478
Now we are both poisoned
with heartbreak.

1629
02:27:26,681 --> 02:27:29,651
Two heroes in a tragedy
of our own making.

1630
02:27:37,157 --> 02:27:40,795
Anyone we touch,
we are their curse.

1631
02:27:41,862 --> 02:27:43,864
A stroke to their cheek,

1632
02:27:43,897 --> 02:27:45,633
a kiss...

1633
02:27:47,368 --> 02:27:49,738
would kill them instantly.

1634
02:27:54,408 --> 02:27:55,476
Yes...

1635
02:27:56,845 --> 02:27:57,978
Madeleine.

1636
02:28:00,715 --> 02:28:04,485
Yes, Mathilde.

1637
02:28:20,668 --> 02:28:23,337
You made me do this,
you see?

1638
02:28:28,710 --> 02:28:30,512
This was your choice.

1639
02:29:18,292 --> 02:29:20,528
Q. Q, are you there?

1640
02:29:20,562 --> 02:29:21,563
<i>Bond, there you are.</i>

1641
02:29:21,596 --> 02:29:22,764
Are they safe, Q?

1642
02:29:22,797 --> 02:29:25,365
<i>Yes, they're safe.</i>

1643
02:29:25,399 --> 02:29:28,001
<i>Bond,
have you left the island?</i>

1644
02:29:28,035 --> 02:29:30,070
There's a slight problem
with the blast doors.

1645
02:29:31,238 --> 02:29:32,306
Won't take a sec.

1646
02:29:34,174 --> 02:29:37,579
No, no, no. Bond, the missiles
have already launched.

1647
02:29:37,612 --> 02:29:39,179
Just get out of there.

1648
02:29:49,990 --> 02:29:51,960
Q, how do I, uh...

1649
02:29:52,827 --> 02:29:54,929
How do I destroy this?

1650
02:29:55,996 --> 02:29:57,765
<i>If the silo doors are open,</i>

1651
02:29:57,799 --> 02:29:58,999
<i>the missiles
will deal with it.</i>

1652
02:29:59,032 --> 02:30:01,703
No. No, no, no.
If you get it on you, how do...

1653
02:30:02,971 --> 02:30:04,639
How do you get it off?

1654
02:30:04,672 --> 02:30:06,173
<i>You know as well as I do
that you can't.</i>

1655
02:30:06,206 --> 02:30:07,675
<i>It's... It's permanent.</i>

1656
02:30:07,709 --> 02:30:11,111
<i>It's eternal. Which is why
we have to destroy it.</i>

1657
02:30:11,144 --> 02:30:14,616
<i>For Christ's sake, James,
just get off the island.</i>

1658
02:30:14,649 --> 02:30:16,818
<i>It's harmless unless
you're near to the target.</i>

1659
02:30:18,653 --> 02:30:22,122
Yeah.
Well, that's not gonna work.

1660
02:30:28,362 --> 02:30:29,831
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1661
02:30:32,399 --> 02:30:33,233
It's for Madeleine.

1662
02:30:37,539 --> 02:30:38,907
It's all right, Q.

1663
02:30:40,240 --> 02:30:42,209
It's all all right.

1664
02:30:43,645 --> 02:30:45,479
Would you put
Madeleine on, please?

1665
02:30:45,513 --> 02:30:46,915
<i>Yes, of course.
How stupid of me.</i>

1666
02:30:52,587 --> 02:30:54,756
<i>Nomi, come in.</i>
<i>Can you put Madeleine on?</i>

1667
02:30:56,423 --> 02:30:57,592
Madeleine.

1668
02:31:05,098 --> 02:31:07,367
- James.
- Madeleine.

1669
02:31:07,401 --> 02:31:08,603
<i>I'm here.</i>

1670
02:31:09,436 --> 02:31:10,504
<i>Where are you?</i>

1671
02:31:12,406 --> 02:31:13,407
Is it done?

1672
02:31:14,508 --> 02:31:15,409
- <i>James?</i>
- Yes.

1673
02:31:15,442 --> 02:31:17,077
Yes, he's... He's dead.

1674
02:31:17,110 --> 02:31:19,279
- Are you both there?
- <i>Yes.</i>

1675
02:31:21,081 --> 02:31:23,685
Good. You're safe.
That's good.

1676
02:31:24,686 --> 02:31:26,320
<i>Have you left?</i>

1677
02:31:29,624 --> 02:31:30,959
No. Um...

1678
02:31:32,426 --> 02:31:33,427
I'm not gonna make it.

1679
02:31:36,129 --> 02:31:37,197
What?

1680
02:31:40,133 --> 02:31:42,537
- Madeleine. Madeleine.
- <i>You promised.</i>

1681
02:31:43,871 --> 02:31:45,238
<i>Just get off that island.</i>

1682
02:31:47,575 --> 02:31:48,810
<i>I know you can do this.</i>

1683
02:31:51,913 --> 02:31:53,615
Everything's good now.

1684
02:31:56,584 --> 02:31:58,720
There's no one left
to hurt us.

1685
02:31:58,753 --> 02:31:59,821
<i>Madeleine...</i>

1686
02:32:03,256 --> 02:32:05,093
you have made...

1687
02:32:06,426 --> 02:32:10,765
the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

1688
02:32:12,934 --> 02:32:14,434
<i>She's perfect.</i>

1689
02:32:18,472 --> 02:32:19,907
<i>Because she came from you.</i>

1690
02:32:31,986 --> 02:32:34,154
<i>Oh, God. The vial.</i>

1691
02:32:38,926 --> 02:32:40,160
You've been poisoned.

1692
02:32:41,963 --> 02:32:42,964
Yes.

1693
02:32:44,132 --> 02:32:45,099
<i>There must be a way.</i>

1694
02:32:50,104 --> 02:32:50,938
There must be a way.

1695
02:33:03,518 --> 02:33:05,019
We just need more time.

1696
02:33:06,154 --> 02:33:07,722
If we only had more time.

1697
02:33:13,728 --> 02:33:15,797
You have all the time
in the world.

1698
02:33:19,734 --> 02:33:21,002
I love you.

1699
02:33:24,572 --> 02:33:25,573
I love you too.

1700
02:33:46,728 --> 02:33:48,395
She does have your eyes.

1701
02:33:52,499 --> 02:33:54,234
I know.

1702
02:34:07,447 --> 02:34:09,016
I know.

1703
02:35:13,480 --> 02:35:16,083
Very hard to know
what to say,

1704
02:35:16,117 --> 02:35:19,754
but I thought we should gather
and remember.

1705
02:35:21,022 --> 02:35:22,657
And I...

1706
02:35:22,690 --> 02:35:27,161
I thought
this was appropriate.

1707
02:35:31,532 --> 02:35:35,870
"The function of man
is to live, not to exist.

1708
02:35:38,973 --> 02:35:41,843
I shall not waste my days
trying to prolong them.

1709
02:35:43,343 --> 02:35:45,478
I shall use my time."

1710
02:35:58,192 --> 02:35:59,327
To James.

1711
02:36:00,528 --> 02:36:01,929
- James.
- James.

1712
02:36:01,963 --> 02:36:03,331
James.

1713
02:36:05,166 --> 02:36:06,868
James.

1714
02:36:15,076 --> 02:36:17,545
Right, back to work.

1715
02:36:34,695 --> 02:36:36,564
Mathilde.

1716
02:36:37,732 --> 02:36:39,333
I'm going to tell you
a story...

1717
02:36:41,769 --> 02:36:43,704
about a man.

1718
02:36:43,738 --> 02:36:45,373
His name was Bond.

1719
02:36:47,241 --> 02:36:48,276
James Bond.
