2
00:01:25,954 --> 00:01:27,487
Lights out!

3
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:31,358
Cletus, are you there?

4
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,595
My angel.

5
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:36,631
This is for you.

6
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,738
What did the doctor say?

7
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:46,641
He said the mutations
are advancing.

8
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:48,743
My powers are too strong.

9
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:50,745
Cletus, I'm scared.

10
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,479
It's gonna be okay.

11
00:01:52,614 --> 00:01:54,582
They're coming to take me away.

12
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,285
They're sending me to a place

13
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:00,354
where there are others like me.

14
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,155
They can't do that.

15
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:05,960
They can't take you from me.

16
00:02:06,094 --> 00:02:08,128
You're my one bright light.

17
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:11,264
I will always love you!

18
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:12,332
Frances!

19
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:15,469
Get off!

20
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,876
Frances!

21
00:02:23,745 --> 00:02:27,347
No! No!

22
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,264
Any last words?

23
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:23,538
<i>Welcome to your new home,
Frances.</i>

24
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:43,117
<i>Your old
boyfriend's finally getting</i>

25
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:45,153
<i>what he deserves.</i>

26
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:51,926
<i>And the world will be
a safer place without him.</i>

27
00:05:25,693 --> 00:05:27,895
<i>Detective Mulligan,
with all due respect,</i>

28
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:30,231
<i>I don't want anything to do
with Cletus Kasady.</i>

29
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:33,034
<i>Well, that's too bad,
because he only wants to see you.</i>

30
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,468
Though, in my opinion, you had
your chance with Kasady

31
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:37,238
and you blew it.

32
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,440
Right, um, so...
what does he want?

33
00:05:40,575 --> 00:05:42,510
Maybe he wants
to spill the beans

34
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,712
about where the missing bodies
are buried.

35
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:48,381
So you're gonna have to do
the right thing for a change.

36
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:54,956
No!

37
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:58,059
Take your tiny hands off of me!

38
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:02,330
We should be out there
protecting the city lethally!

39
00:06:07,235 --> 00:06:09,103
What was that?

40
00:06:09,237 --> 00:06:10,504
Unhand me!

41
00:06:10,638 --> 00:06:13,541
Man should never
consent to crawl

42
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:16,210
when he has
the impulse to fly.

43
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:19,914
You are a bottom-feeder.

44
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,549
Be quiet.

45
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,219
How many times have I told you

46
00:06:25,353 --> 00:06:29,357
that I want you to hide
yourself when I am working?

47
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,058
I am serious. It is important.

48
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:32,760
You have to show me respect.

49
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:34,629
- Respect? Respect?
- Yes. Yes.

50
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:35,963
- Okay.
- Okay.

51
00:06:36,097 --> 00:06:37,899
Kasady gonna give you
the scoop, right?

52
00:06:38,032 --> 00:06:39,700
- Right.
- Wrong.

53
00:06:39,834 --> 00:06:42,136
- What do you mean?
- Because you blow everything.

54
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,337
Oh, okay, I see.

55
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,906
You're talking
about Anne again.

56
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,674
I miss her!

57
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,778
I will do it.

58
00:06:50,912 --> 00:06:52,213
I don't like you.

59
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:53,614
<i>Let me eat him!</i>

60
00:06:53,748 --> 00:06:58,019
You do not deserve nice things.

61
00:07:08,963 --> 00:07:12,066
<i>Welcome back, Eddie Brock.</i>

62
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,070
I've been thinking about you.

63
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:19,974
What do you want, Cletus?

64
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:22,777
I mean, why am I here?

65
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:28,983
Do a man who's buried alive
a kindness, won't you?

66
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:32,620
Get a message out to all my...

67
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:33,654
fans.

68
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:38,859
And in return,
I'll give you my life.

69
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:39,927
What?

70
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:41,262
Story.

71
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,864
I heard the written word

72
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:46,734
hasn't been working out
so well.

73
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:50,938
Piece like this,
an exclusive...

74
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:53,975
...would put you back on top.

75
00:07:56,077 --> 00:07:57,244
Go on.

76
00:07:57,378 --> 00:08:00,081
People love...

77
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:01,782
serial killers.

78
00:08:03,284 --> 00:08:09,190
All my secrets laid bare,
Eddie.

79
00:08:09,323 --> 00:08:12,526
So much carnage.

80
00:08:14,095 --> 00:08:15,096
But why me?

81
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:18,165
I like you.

82
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,368
All right, it's a deal.

83
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:22,536
What's your message?

84
00:08:25,406 --> 00:08:29,377
That distant cathedral

85
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,079
- is all I see...
- Mm-hmm.

86
00:08:32,213 --> 00:08:36,550
<i>...fractured angel</i>

87
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:39,020
<i>the other part of me.</i>

88
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,024
Print that in your column.

89
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:46,227
Is that it? This, um...
Who's gonna...

90
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,697
Who's gonna read that,
some random haiku?

91
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:52,833
Print it,

92
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:56,404
and what's mine is yours.

93
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,706
Wow, lucky me.

94
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,509
Goodbye, Eddie.

95
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,410
Thank you.

96
00:09:02,543 --> 00:09:04,513
Thank you.

97
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:06,547
<i>What a dick.</i>

98
00:09:07,681 --> 00:09:10,484
<i>Eddie, look. Look.</i>

99
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:12,019
What are you doing?

100
00:09:12,153 --> 00:09:14,255
<i>Your job for you.</i>

101
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:23,230
Eddie.

102
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,602
Don't forget me, Eddie.

103
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:38,479
What did you get?

104
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:41,482
Uh, I got a headache
and probably got tuberculosis.

105
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:43,317
What? A little louder.

106
00:09:43,451 --> 00:09:45,886
He read me poetry, man.

107
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,221
Is this some kind of joke
to you, Eddie?

108
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:48,923
Because I'm not laughing.

109
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,991
<i>Yeah,
you could do with a laugh.</i>

110
00:09:51,125 --> 00:09:52,626
Come on, man.

111
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,662
These things, they just take
a little time, all right?

112
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:56,330
Well, the second
he gives you something...

113
00:09:56,464 --> 00:09:57,566
Of course.

114
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,266
Keep me ahead of the curve,
Eddie.

115
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,734
- Don't embarrass me.
- All right.

116
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:02,002
Do you understand?

117
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:04,004
Trust me, the only scoop

118
00:10:04,138 --> 00:10:06,541
I'm getting today
is double chocolate chip.

119
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:08,809
<i>No! I get brain freeze.</i>

120
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:15,249
<i>Come here.</i>

121
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:16,717
<i>Look.</i>

122
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:18,452
- I'm looking.
- <i>Grab those.</i>

123
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:22,323
All right.

124
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,061
Whoa. Okay.

125
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:32,099
<i>Now, what do you think?</i>

126
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,768
- I think I'm Pablo Picasso.
- <i>No!</i>

127
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:39,173
- Okay.
- <i>Come here. Look.</i>

128
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,379
- <i>Well, say what you see.</i>
- Uh, it's a house.

129
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:46,515
<i>Never mind.</i>

130
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,356
Oh, I know this one.

131
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,191
- It's a tree.
- <i>Idiot.</i>

132
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,993
<i>Sit down.</i>

133
00:11:00,194 --> 00:11:03,197
<i>Now, pay attention.</i>

134
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:27,788
<i>Bingo.</i>

135
00:11:27,922 --> 00:11:30,391
Holy cow.

136
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,600
Would you say your
friendship with Cletus Kasady

137
00:11:38,732 --> 00:11:41,268
is what allowed you to solve
this decades-old mystery?

138
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:43,037
You are the only person
from the outside world

139
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,238
he's spoken with.

140
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,607
Seems he likes you.

141
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,441
Well, you know,
he's a serial killer.

142
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:49,343
I don't see how
he can like anyone.

143
00:11:49,476 --> 00:11:51,111
<i>Brock was able to uncover</i>

144
00:11:51,245 --> 00:11:53,214
<i>what the FBI and police
could not.</i>

145
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,884
<i>Bowing to public outrage,</i>

146
00:11:57,017 --> 00:11:59,853
<i>the governor of California
has overturned his moratorium</i>

147
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:02,223
<i>and reinstated
the death penalty for Kasady.</i>

148
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:11,165
<i>Brock's career has been given
a much-needed revival,</i>

149
00:12:11,298 --> 00:12:13,167
<i>putting him back on top
once more.</i>

150
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,086
<i>A harrowing story
finally comes to an end.</i>

151
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:35,122
<i>Vindication for the victims
and closure for the families.</i>

152
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,626
<i>Thanks to the diligence
of one man.</i>

153
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:40,060
- <i>Thank you, Eddie Brock.</i>
- And Venom.

154
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:43,632
You know,
this could be us, Eddie.

155
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:48,269
Going out there, solving cases,
fighting bad guys.

156
00:12:48,402 --> 00:12:50,170
Maybe I eat them, hmm?

157
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:52,439
And then we save the day.

158
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:54,808
<i>But we saved the day.
It's done.</i>

159
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:59,514
You said I could eat bad guys!

160
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:01,348
<i>This again?</i>

161
00:13:01,482 --> 00:13:03,685
I need to be free,

162
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:07,689
feeling the wind in my hair
and the sand between my toes.

163
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,023
<i>You don't have any hair.</i>

164
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:10,759
You are not listening to me.

165
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:12,627
<i>Oh, I'm listening.</i>

166
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:15,429
I cannot live
like this anymore.

167
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:18,232
- I'm starving.
- <i>So eat those guys.</i>

168
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:19,933
I can't.

169
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,935
Sonny and Cher
are best friends.

170
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:24,572
<i>Are you serious?
That's ridiculous. That's what...</i>

171
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:30,679
Man, that was abusive.

172
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,279
That was abuse.

173
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:36,183
And that's a $2,000 TV.

174
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:38,520
You have got to get control
of your aggression.

175
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:40,020
That is why we have Snookie!

176
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,489
<i>I cannot live on chicken
and chocolate alone.</i>

177
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:43,891
<i>I need brains.</i>

178
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,392
Chickens have brains.

179
00:13:45,527 --> 00:13:47,461
<i>I most passionately disagree.</i>

180
00:13:48,663 --> 00:13:50,030
<i>Look.</i>

181
00:13:50,164 --> 00:13:51,965
<i>Look at those poor idiots.</i>

182
00:13:53,635 --> 00:13:55,135
<i>Small brains.</i>

183
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:57,304
Come on, man, it's not
their fault that you, uh...

184
00:13:57,438 --> 00:13:59,306
you live on
the old phenylethyla...

185
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,742
- laphenylethylan.
- <i>Phenylethylalanine.</i>

186
00:14:00,874 --> 00:14:02,142
Yeah, I just...
I just said that.

187
00:14:02,276 --> 00:14:03,712
<i>I've told you a thousand times,</i>

188
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,479
- <i>because it is only found...</i>
- Yeah?

189
00:14:05,613 --> 00:14:07,848
- <i>...in brains and in chocolate.</i>
- And in chocolate.

190
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:09,883
That's right. All right,
well, how about this?

191
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:13,387
You live in my body,
you live by my rules.

192
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:15,456
- <i>I live in your body because...</i>
- Why?

193
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,626
<i>...unfortunately,
I don't have many options.</i>

194
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,729
Well, how about this, son?

195
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:22,831
The FBI is still
investigating us

196
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:25,499
for all of that stuff that
"we were involved with,"

197
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,868
so if one more head
goes missing,

198
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:31,171
we will get hauled off
into Area 51.

199
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:32,574
They will kill us both.

200
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:35,510
So somebody has to be
responsible.

201
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:39,814
<i>Responsibility...
it's for the mediocre.</i>

202
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,652
- <i>Food!</i>
- Can you stop doing that?

203
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:47,254
- <i>Food! Food!</i>
- Please just stop doing that now.

204
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:48,556
- Come on, stop doing that.
- <i>Food!</i>

205
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,023
- I have a deadline! Will you...
- <i>Food...!</i>

206
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:51,959
Goddamn it! Fine!

207
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,434
- Good evening, Eddie.
- Hey, Mrs. Chen.

208
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:02,102
Good evening, Venom.

209
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:03,638
He says hi. Oh.

210
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:05,072
Chocolate hasn't arrived yet.

211
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:08,041
- <i>No!</i>
- Oh, no. We have a deal.

212
00:15:08,175 --> 00:15:10,578
What's gonna happen?
You gonna stop protecting me?

213
00:15:10,712 --> 00:15:12,212
I don't think so.

214
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:13,882
I've been keeping
my mouth shut,

215
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,049
- feeding your little secret.
- Wow.

216
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:18,986
Little old Mrs. Chen is
a little old blackmailer, huh?

217
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:21,589
Less of the old. I am 39.

218
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:24,057
- <i>And I am Barry Manilow.</i>
- Right.

219
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:25,926
<i>I am happy to eat Mrs. Chen.</i>

220
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,696
No, no, you cannot eat
Mrs. Chen.

221
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:32,634
- What?
- Well, I guess it's gonna have to be plan B.

222
00:15:34,736 --> 00:15:36,604
What's plan B?

223
00:15:36,738 --> 00:15:38,907
Aah! Not this again!

224
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:42,042
I need human brains to survive.

225
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:44,311
<i>Uh-uh.
Now, pick up some chickens, man.</i>

226
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:45,814
<i>Let's go.</i>

227
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:02,296
I'm done with this grossness.

228
00:16:06,634 --> 00:16:09,604
Look at all the amazing things
that we can do.

229
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:15,309
We are wasting our talent.

230
00:16:23,751 --> 00:16:25,352
Bad guy.

231
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,826
Hello, kitty.

232
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:35,496
<i>Leave him. Leave him be.</i>

233
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,031
<i>Leave him be! Leave him be!</i>

234
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:41,268
- I shall remove your head.
- <i>No, you won't.</i>

235
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,505
- I will use it for bowling!
- <i>No, you will not.</i>

236
00:16:43,638 --> 00:16:45,339
I will take it to...

237
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:47,107
What is the one
that we like, Eddie?

238
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:48,543
<i>It's Lucky Strike.</i>

239
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:50,812
- Yes! Lucky Strike!
- <i>Put him down!</i>

240
00:16:50,945 --> 00:16:52,647
I will take you
to Lucky Strike,

241
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,148
and I will score
a 300-point game.

242
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,050
- <i>You won't.</i>
- The rest of your pudgy little

243
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,687
boy body will be left here...

244
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:01,923
...rolling around
in dumpster juice.

245
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:04,024
<i>Oh, God.</i>

246
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,928
<i>No! Put him down!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,</i>

247
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,830
<i>no, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

248
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:10,732
<i>No!</i>

249
00:17:10,865 --> 00:17:12,399
Fine!

250
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,236
<i>She didn't want our help.</i>

251
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:19,239
She did not know
she needed our help, Eddie.

252
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:20,842
There is a difference.

253
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:27,247
<i>It is Anne.</i>

254
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:30,585
<i>Anne is on the phone, Eddie!</i>

255
00:17:33,086 --> 00:17:34,556
Hey, Anne.

256
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:36,189
<i>Hey, E-Eddie. Hi.</i>

257
00:17:36,323 --> 00:17:37,424
- <i>Hi.</i>
- <i>Be nice to her.</i>

258
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,893
<i>You sound out of breath.</i>

259
00:17:39,027 --> 00:17:41,663
I'm-I'm not catching you
at a bad time, am I?

260
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:44,164
No, no, not at all.
I'm just, uh...

261
00:17:44,298 --> 00:17:46,400
- I'm just hanging around.
- <i>Okay.</i>

262
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:49,369
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry
I haven't returned your calls.

263
00:17:49,504 --> 00:17:51,171
I guess...

264
00:17:51,305 --> 00:17:54,207
I just needed a little space
after the whole...

265
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:56,644
alien biting a guy's
head off thing, so...

266
00:17:56,778 --> 00:17:58,312
<i>Ah, the good old days.</i>

267
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:00,314
Anyway, so I have some news,

268
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,316
and-and I was wondering
if we could meet.

269
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,652
- <i>Yes!</i>
- Yeah, sure, that would be, uh...

270
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:07,087
<i>That would be fine. Great.</i>

271
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,256
Okay, great.
Uh, how's tomorrow night?

272
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,559
Tomorrow night? Yeah, great.

273
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:13,728
- <i>8:00?</i>
- L'Araignée?

274
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:15,128
- Okay, great.
- Looking forward to it.

275
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,496
Oh... Yeah, okay.
Me, too. Bye.

276
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:17,665
Great.

277
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:18,933
<i>It's over with the doctor!</i>

278
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:20,334
<i>That is the voice of a woman</i>

279
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:22,302
<i>who just got brutally dumped.</i>

280
00:18:29,777 --> 00:18:31,278
Stop.

281
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,313
<i>Don't you want
to look your best?</i>

282
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:36,316
Just leave me alone.
You are always nitpicking.

283
00:18:42,056 --> 00:18:43,256
Wow.

284
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,892
Hey.

285
00:18:45,026 --> 00:18:46,728
Hey.

286
00:18:46,861 --> 00:18:48,763
- Okay. Hi.
- Yeah.

287
00:18:49,897 --> 00:18:51,899
Wow.

288
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:56,804
<i>Awkward.</i>

289
00:18:56,938 --> 00:18:58,806
So, uh, h-how's it going?
How's, uh...

290
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,975
- How's Mr. Belvedere? Yeah.
- Uh, good, good.

291
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:02,944
You know, he's still wiping
his ass on the carpet.

292
00:19:03,077 --> 00:19:04,679
He learned that from you.

293
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:07,381
Yeah, how-how's, uh...
how's the legal aid work going?

294
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:09,483
Well, you know how much
I love an underdog, so...

295
00:19:09,617 --> 00:19:11,451
Yeah. Yeah, that's why you...

296
00:19:11,586 --> 00:19:13,487
put up with me
for so long, huh?

297
00:19:13,621 --> 00:19:14,522
You said it.

298
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:18,059
- S-So...
- So...

299
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:20,293
<i>So?</i>

300
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:22,462
I don't know, I-I thought
it would be better

301
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:24,464
to tell you in person that...

302
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:26,500
Uh-huh.

303
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:30,170
<i>No!</i>

304
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,773
Wow. Oh, Anne.

305
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:33,173
Wow, that is, uh...

306
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:35,610
that is so much bigger
than the...

307
00:19:35,743 --> 00:19:37,145
the one that I got you.

308
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,680
<i>Ugh, it's gaudy.</i>

309
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:40,682
That's Dan, right?
Doc-Doctor Dan.

310
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:42,182
Yeah, that... it's Dan.

311
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:44,118
Holy shit, Anne. Way to go.

312
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:45,153
Are you okay?

313
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,587
Yeah, I'm okay.

314
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:48,890
- <i>Well, I am not okay.</i>
- Yeah.

315
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:50,323
You could just say,
"Congratulations.

316
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:51,859
I'm happy for you."

317
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:53,393
You know, like two people

318
00:19:53,528 --> 00:19:55,228
who still care enough
about each other to lie

319
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:57,330
so that the other one doesn't
feel like complete shit. I...

320
00:19:57,464 --> 00:19:59,000
Maybe we could do
that version of this?

321
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,334
No, I am...
I am happy for you, Anne.

322
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:02,870
- You know, I'm, uh...
- <i>No.</i>

323
00:20:03,004 --> 00:20:04,204
Congratulations.

324
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:05,673
Thank you.

325
00:20:05,807 --> 00:20:08,408
<i>That was going to be us, Eddie.</i>

326
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:10,778
<i>I, for one, would not
be inconsolable</i>

327
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:12,513
<i>if Dan were to fall
into traffic</i>

328
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:14,247
<i>and lose his head and his feet</i>

329
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,349
- <i>and all of his teeth!</i>
- What?

330
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:17,518
What was that?

331
00:20:17,652 --> 00:20:20,054
What? Nothing.

332
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:21,622
Whoa.

333
00:20:21,756 --> 00:20:23,725
If I ask you a question,

334
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:26,094
do you have the ability
to tell me the truth?

335
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,762
You mean as in being

336
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:29,864
super happy for you
because of your engagement?

337
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:31,532
Because, I mean,
you just told me to lie,

338
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,534
so that's really,
really confusing.

339
00:20:33,668 --> 00:20:34,836
Is Venom with you?

340
00:20:35,737 --> 00:20:37,038
He's dead.

341
00:20:37,171 --> 00:20:38,940
<i>I am.
I'm playing dead right now.</i>

342
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:40,273
Yeah, I mean, he...

343
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:43,177
- Right.
- Okay.

344
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,679
- Okay.
- Okay.

345
00:20:44,812 --> 00:20:47,380
Well, that's...

346
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,218
You just don't change, do you?

347
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,753
What are you talking about?
This is just a...

348
00:20:51,886 --> 00:20:53,888
It's a huge shock.
Um, I'm in...

349
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:56,456
Anne, I'm in love with you.
This is a lot to process.

350
00:20:56,591 --> 00:20:58,559
No, the truth is you don't
love anybody. You can't.

351
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:00,595
Commitment's just not
your thing.

352
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:03,164
All right, then, fine.

353
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,398
Do not marry Dan.

354
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:08,102
- Dan makes me feel safe.
- Ugh.

355
00:21:08,236 --> 00:21:10,972
Okay, and you made me feel
like I was on a roller coaster.

356
00:21:11,105 --> 00:21:13,574
And sometimes you just
have to know when to get off.

357
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,176
- Yeah, and not yak.
- <i>And not yak!</i>

358
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,744
You know, not yak.

359
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:18,411
Yak.

360
00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:23,450
Hey, Venom.

361
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,621
Take care of him, all right?

362
00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:28,689
Don't let him keep
messing everything up.

363
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:31,626
<i>I'm going to make you cry
now, Eddie.</i>

364
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:33,393
<i>She will love it.</i>

365
00:21:33,528 --> 00:21:36,396
<i>Cry. Cry.</i>

366
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:38,266
It's a lot to process.

367
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:41,769
Congratulations, Anne.

368
00:21:41,903 --> 00:21:43,805
It's great news.

369
00:21:55,283 --> 00:21:56,416
<i>Slow down, pal.</i>

370
00:21:56,551 --> 00:21:57,752
Why?

371
00:21:57,885 --> 00:21:59,954
You don't believe
in consequences.

372
00:22:00,087 --> 00:22:02,455
No injuries. You fix them.

373
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,625
No hangovers. You mend them.

374
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:06,828
I couldn't even hurt myself
if I tried.

375
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:19,406
<i>Eddie, I apologize
that I can't mend the heart.</i>

376
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,743
<i>Emotional pain,
it hits much harder,</i>

377
00:22:22,877 --> 00:22:25,146
<i>and it lasts longer.</i>

378
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:30,551
<i>You just need to pull up
your big-boy pants and take it.</i>

379
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:32,854
Yeah, well, that's easy
for you to say.

380
00:22:32,987 --> 00:22:35,122
<i>Why?</i>

381
00:22:35,256 --> 00:22:37,558
Because I'm a real boy

382
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:40,393
and you're just an amoeba.

383
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:42,196
<i>I will only take that</i>

384
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:44,832
<i>because we are hurting
right now.</i>

385
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,840
<i>Don't worry, buddy.
I will get you through this.</i>

386
00:23:00,114 --> 00:23:02,149
Do you know what always
cheers me up

387
00:23:02,283 --> 00:23:04,285
in the morning, Eddie?

388
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:07,121

00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:57,031
<i>Yes, Mama, I'm a bad, bad boy.</i>

423
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:59,333

<i>"Cletus Kasady."</i>

Kiss, hug, kiss, hug.

435
00:25:51,952 --> 00:25:53,421
Smiley face.

436
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:56,023
Ew.

437
00:25:56,157 --> 00:25:57,391
<i>Nutjob.</i>

438
00:25:57,526 --> 00:25:59,060
You know, I-I should be there.

439
00:25:59,193 --> 00:26:00,594
<i>Uh, no, it's a bad idea.</i>

440
00:26:00,728 --> 00:26:02,229
I mean, I-I-I put him there.

441
00:26:02,363 --> 00:26:03,864
<i>Actually, he put himself there</i>

442
00:26:03,998 --> 00:26:06,333
<i>when he decided to be
a complete lunatic.</i>

443
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:08,002
<i>Ta-da!</i>

444
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:10,438
You know, it would be nice
just to have your support

445
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:12,473
just... I mean, just for once.

446
00:26:12,606 --> 00:26:15,409
- <i>Catsup?</i>
- You know what I mean?

447
00:26:15,544 --> 00:26:17,578
<i>This place is an
all-you-can-eat buffet.</i>

448
00:26:17,711 --> 00:26:19,113
<i>Who's going to care</i>

449
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:21,048
<i>if I polish off
a couple of these idiots?</i>

450
00:26:21,182 --> 00:26:23,250
You can't be sure who is
and who is not guilty, buddy.

451
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:24,952
- <i>They're in prison!</i>
- Yeah, but, you know,

452
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:26,487
some people take
false confessions.

453
00:26:26,654 --> 00:26:27,922
They, uh... you know,
they take pleas.

454
00:26:28,055 --> 00:26:29,223
We watched <i>Making a Murderer.</i>

455
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:30,424
You all right?

456
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,059
Yeah, man, I'm just practicing.

457
00:26:32,193 --> 00:26:33,894
<i>I am a predator, Eddie.</i>

458
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:36,130
- Mm-hmm.
- <i>Lions do not eat salad.</i>

459
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:37,798
Yeah, but you're not a lion,
are you?

460
00:26:37,932 --> 00:26:39,667
I mean, I see you
more of a vexatious little

461
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,769
pig, dog, house bat thing.

462
00:26:41,902 --> 00:26:42,970
That's fine.

463
00:26:43,104 --> 00:26:44,905
- <i>You suck.</i>
- You suck!

464
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,740
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, wow.

465
00:26:46,874 --> 00:26:48,577
I don't have
an explanation for that.

466
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:51,779
I think I just... I'm having
a panic attack, um...

467
00:26:51,912 --> 00:26:53,447
Yeah, I'll sign here.

468
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:56,484
Stand two feet away
from the bars.

469
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:58,587
No touching the condemned.

470
00:26:58,719 --> 00:27:00,654
Understood.

471
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:03,791
Visitor's here.

472
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:13,167
This is a "me" thing,
not a "we" thing.

473
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,102
<i>Everything is a "you" thing.</i>

474
00:27:15,236 --> 00:27:18,672
Oh, happy day for
you, Eddie Brock.

475
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:21,543
Mm, what a scoop.

476
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:24,178
The end of the Magical...

477
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:26,180
Misery Tour.

478
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:29,150
I worry for your soul.

479
00:27:29,283 --> 00:27:30,784
How will you live
with the weight

480
00:27:30,918 --> 00:27:32,621
of snuffing out a man's life?

481
00:27:32,753 --> 00:27:34,655
I was, uh... I was hoping

482
00:27:34,788 --> 00:27:36,824
maybe you could give me
a couple pointers.

483
00:27:40,161 --> 00:27:42,029
Funny little guy, aren't you?

484
00:27:42,163 --> 00:27:43,797
<i>Don't need that.</i>

485
00:27:43,931 --> 00:27:45,833
<i>My memory is outstanding.</i>

486
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:49,370
<i>Rude.</i>

487
00:27:49,504 --> 00:27:52,106
Consequences.

488
00:27:52,239 --> 00:27:55,809
Every decision you ever make.

489
00:27:55,943 --> 00:27:59,380
Who do we leave behind,

490
00:27:59,514 --> 00:28:01,048
and how do we leave them?

491
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,820
A connubial bed, empty,

492
00:28:06,954 --> 00:28:09,823
waiting in the darkness

493
00:28:09,957 --> 00:28:12,993
for the rescuer
who never comes.

494
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:14,361
Because of you.

495
00:28:14,495 --> 00:28:15,996
<i>This guy makes zero sense.</i>

496
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:20,034
You and I are the same.

497
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:22,369
No. No, we're not.

498
00:28:22,504 --> 00:28:25,739
Twisted insides, mean daddies.

499
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:28,577
You feel like home to me,
Eddie, like family.

500
00:28:29,644 --> 00:28:30,911
And really, truly,

501
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:33,714
that is all I ever wanted
in this world.

502
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:35,182
Family.

503
00:28:35,316 --> 00:28:37,519
Well, killing your grandmother
and your mother

504
00:28:37,652 --> 00:28:39,220
sure is a funny way
of showing it.

505
00:28:41,623 --> 00:28:46,060
Anything you want to unburden
yourself with before...

506
00:28:47,529 --> 00:28:50,931
...um, this happens?

507
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,400
Yes.

508
00:28:53,535 --> 00:28:58,339
I have wishes
to bestow upon you.

509
00:28:58,472 --> 00:28:59,840
<i>Oh, that is kind.</i>

510
00:28:59,974 --> 00:29:03,844
I want to wish you...

511
00:29:03,978 --> 00:29:05,846
this heartbreak.

512
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,748
<i>Uh-oh. Too late.</i>

513
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:11,553
I wish for you
to see out your days alone,

514
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:13,555
as you always have been.

515
00:29:13,688 --> 00:29:14,922
<i>Watch it, pal.</i>

516
00:29:15,055 --> 00:29:16,558
Wh-Where are you going
with this?

517
00:29:16,691 --> 00:29:18,926
You are a cancer

518
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:22,597
to everyone
who ever loved you, Eddie.

519
00:29:22,731 --> 00:29:26,166
Deceived your trusting fiancée.

520
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:30,572
And no wonder Daddy
could never look at you again

521
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:33,407
after you killed his wife,
your mother,

522
00:29:33,541 --> 00:29:35,309
just by being born.

523
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:37,244
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

524
00:29:37,378 --> 00:29:39,146
No, no! No, no, no, don't!
Don't!

525
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,516
<i>Speak to my friend
again like that... I dare you!</i>

526
00:29:43,884 --> 00:29:45,919
Hey, hey!

527
00:29:46,987 --> 00:29:47,888
No touching the inmate.

528
00:29:48,022 --> 00:29:49,323
Hey, back up!

529
00:29:54,061 --> 00:29:55,296
Eddie?

530
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:57,097
You're done.

531
00:29:57,231 --> 00:30:02,504
I have tasted blood before,
my friend, and that is not it.

532
00:30:02,637 --> 00:30:06,273
Eddie Brock has a big secret.

533
00:30:06,407 --> 00:30:07,941
Shut up, Kasady!

534
00:30:17,885 --> 00:30:19,621
<i>That may have been a mistake.</i>

535
00:30:19,754 --> 00:30:21,656
Shut up.

536
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,725
Hey, aren't you Eddie Brock?

537
00:30:23,857 --> 00:30:25,794
I don't know anymore.

538
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:29,631
<i>Eddie!</i>

539
00:30:29,764 --> 00:30:31,398
I don't want to hear
another word out your mouth.

540
00:30:31,533 --> 00:30:33,133
- <i>Eddie.</i>
- I don't want to hear it.

541
00:30:33,267 --> 00:30:35,135
<i>Eddie, I am sorry.</i>

542
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:37,672
<i>That was his last
time on record ever.</i>

543
00:30:37,806 --> 00:30:40,174
There's no more...
any words for his victims or...

544
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:41,842
You know, they're gone.

545
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:44,244
Any clues
of outstanding bodies,

546
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:46,046
we-we've lost forever
and completely.

547
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,582
<i>I didn't mean to.</i>

548
00:30:47,716 --> 00:30:49,216
- You didn't mean to?
- <i>And I said I'm sorry.</i>

549
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,685
You didn't mean to,
but you did it.

550
00:30:50,819 --> 00:30:52,219
I mean, you just decided...
I don't know.

551
00:30:52,353 --> 00:30:53,555
That's it, you did it.

552
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:55,122
You know,
you didn't even think

553
00:30:55,255 --> 00:30:56,791
that we might get caught,
we might get killed?

554
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:58,392
No, you don't think about
things like that, do you?

555
00:30:58,526 --> 00:31:00,027
You just think about chickens,
you think about you,

556
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,731
you think about what you want,
and you think about you.

557
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:04,632
<i>Let me remind you
of something, Eddie.</i>

558
00:31:04,766 --> 00:31:06,467
<i>You were a loser
before I came along.</i>

559
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:08,536
<i>You were nothing.
I made you special.</i>

560
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,003
Oh, you made me special, huh?

561
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:11,338
Well, let me tell you
something, right?

562
00:31:11,472 --> 00:31:12,906
Before you came along,
I had a life.

563
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,542
I didn't have chickens,
all right? But I had dreams.

564
00:31:14,676 --> 00:31:15,976
Yeah, I had dreams,
and I had a fiancée,

565
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,679
and I had a really successful
TV show!

566
00:31:17,812 --> 00:31:20,682
<i>Ah, but you destroyed all
of those things by yourself.</i>

567
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:24,017
Yeah, but you know what?
I rebuilt my life,

568
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:25,854
and now I just want to live it.
Good night.

569
00:31:25,986 --> 00:31:27,254
<i>And how did you build
this new life?</i>

570
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:28,690
- Hmm?
- Excuse me?

571
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:30,625
Well, who found the clue
on the wall

572
00:31:30,759 --> 00:31:33,060
so you could be
this big, shiny hero?

573
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:34,696
Hmm? Who found the clue?

574
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:36,463
- Who?
- Wow.

575
00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:37,732
Yeah.

576
00:31:37,866 --> 00:31:39,233
No, no, no.

577
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:42,936
This is not about
being a hero for me, man.

578
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:46,574
This is about wanting
to live in peace.

579
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:49,711
D-Do you understand
what I'm talking about?

580
00:31:49,844 --> 00:31:51,211
No, you don't.

581
00:31:51,345 --> 00:31:52,580
You don't understand
what I'm talking about.

582
00:31:52,714 --> 00:31:54,114
Okay, this is about me
wanting to live

583
00:31:54,248 --> 00:31:56,718
without you whining
in my ear all the time

584
00:31:56,851 --> 00:32:00,555
about eating bad guys
or, like, nagging me about Anne

585
00:32:00,688 --> 00:32:02,891
or destroying my place
or destroying my life!

586
00:32:03,023 --> 00:32:06,728
Do you know how lucky you are
that I chose you?

587
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:08,462
You chose me?

588
00:32:08,596 --> 00:32:10,464
Buddy, I'm the only person
that took you in

589
00:32:10,598 --> 00:32:12,466
when your friends kicked you
off the planet Ming Mong

590
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,101
'cause you are a reject!

591
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:16,571
You are a pariah.
Lethal protection, my ass.

592
00:32:16,704 --> 00:32:18,573
You couldn't protect anything.
You are useless.

593
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:21,275
You couldn't get a job
down here cleaning toilets!

594
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:23,310
I'm sorry.

595
00:32:23,444 --> 00:32:24,612
I don't know what came over me.

596
00:32:24,746 --> 00:32:25,914
Please, let me fix it.

597
00:32:26,046 --> 00:32:27,515
So I can break it again!

598
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,924
You son of a bitch.

599
00:32:43,565 --> 00:32:44,766
Out!

600
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:45,999
Get out.

601
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:47,535
Take your stuff. Get out!

602
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:49,938
This is my house.

603
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:52,172
No!

604
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:53,608
Keep it down up there!

605
00:32:56,611 --> 00:32:57,912
Get out!

606
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:09,624
Sonny?

607
00:33:09,757 --> 00:33:11,325
You wouldn't dare!

608
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:13,427
Yeah, absolutely.

609
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:17,765
No, no, no!

610
00:33:17,899 --> 00:33:19,366
- <i>Yeah!</i>
- No!

611
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,935
I'm calling the police!

612
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:22,770
I-I am so sorry.

613
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:27,374
Show yourself.

614
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:41,823
You can't win!
Take a look at me.

615
00:33:41,956 --> 00:33:43,758
Look at the size of you.

616
00:33:43,892 --> 00:33:45,527
Puny.

617
00:33:48,696 --> 00:33:50,264
How dare you?

618
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,404
I guess this is goodbye.

619
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:00,675
Oh, yeah.
Finally something we agree on.

620
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:07,481
What in the world?

621
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:09,182
All this crazy shit.

622
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:10,818
Yeah.

623
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:24,732
Hmm?

624
00:34:27,301 --> 00:34:29,369
No. No.

625
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,405
No, no, no, no.

626
00:34:33,508 --> 00:34:35,142
No!

627
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:37,277
Yeah!

628
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:39,279
No!

629
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:41,381
- Yeah!
- No!

630
00:34:42,517 --> 00:34:44,084
Oh, yeah.

631
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:46,286
No.

632
00:34:51,593 --> 00:34:52,961
No, no, no.

633
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:54,796
I wish I never met you!

634
00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:57,999
<i>Sayonara!</i>

635
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:13,380
Cletus Kasady,
you have been tried, convicted

636
00:35:13,514 --> 00:35:16,584
and sentenced to death
by the state of California.

637
00:35:18,418 --> 00:35:22,489
May your passing bring closure
to the victims' families,

638
00:35:22,624 --> 00:35:26,393
and may you find peace
in the hereafter.

639
00:35:26,527 --> 00:35:29,129
Soon come chaos.

640
00:35:29,262 --> 00:35:31,899
Chaos soon come.

641
00:35:33,067 --> 00:35:34,602
Are those your final words?

642
00:35:37,005 --> 00:35:38,472
Enjoy the show.

643
00:36:16,744 --> 00:36:19,179
Warden.

644
00:36:19,312 --> 00:36:21,683
Something wicked...

645
00:36:21,816 --> 00:36:24,018
this way comes.

646
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:36,430
Somebody let me out!

647
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,006
Don't move!

648
00:38:02,917 --> 00:38:04,484
Hey!

649
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:20,433
Please.

650
00:38:22,203 --> 00:38:23,838
I got a family.

651
00:38:48,196 --> 00:38:50,497
Any last words, Warden?

652
00:38:50,631 --> 00:38:52,332
Don't! Please!

653
00:39:08,348 --> 00:39:12,385
♪ San Quentin, may you rot
And burn in hell ♪

654
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:16,057
♪ May your walls fall down
And may I live to tell ♪

655
00:39:17,592 --> 00:39:21,394

You tasted just like ham ♪

657
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:53,294
You two are being evicted.

658
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:04,872
Come on, don't look at me
like that.

659
00:40:05,006 --> 00:40:06,607
It was never,
never gonna work out.

660
00:40:06,741 --> 00:40:07,975
All right?

661
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:19,854
Yes.

662
00:40:19,987 --> 00:40:21,722
<i>Just because of
how quickly he moved in...</i>

663
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:23,224
<i>...the offensive line cannot pick him up.</i>

664
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:24,792
<i>Breaking news.</i>

665
00:40:24,926 --> 00:40:26,961
<i>Serial killer Cletus Kasady
is on the run...</i>

666
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:28,461
Shit.

667
00:40:28,596 --> 00:40:29,897
<i>...as a statewide
manhunt is underway...</i>

668
00:40:30,031 --> 00:40:31,899
- Oh, shit.
- <i>...after last night's audacious</i>

669
00:40:32,033 --> 00:40:33,367
<i>escape from San Quentin Prison.</i>

670
00:40:39,907 --> 00:40:42,276
<i>It is absolutely chaos here.</i>

671
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,613
<i>We have reports
of multiple casualties.</i>

672
00:40:45,746 --> 00:40:48,149
<i>We don't how Cletus Kasady...</i>

673
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:49,617
- Hey.
- What, you're not dead?

674
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,985
No.

675
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:52,853
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, sure.

676
00:40:52,987 --> 00:40:54,454
Come on in.

677
00:40:54,588 --> 00:40:58,192
Uh, yeah, I was just seeing
for myself on the news.

678
00:40:58,326 --> 00:41:01,461
Yeah, on a scale
of one to ten, it's 11 bad.

679
00:41:01,595 --> 00:41:03,531
Reports coming
from San Quentin are,

680
00:41:03,664 --> 00:41:05,700
quite frankly, bananas.
Nice TV.

681
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:07,935
W-Well, how-how did he do it?

682
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:09,637
- Yeah, how did he, indeed?
- Yeah.

683
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,339
That's the million-dollar
question.

684
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:13,708
And yet again, you were
his special visitor.

685
00:41:13,841 --> 00:41:15,509
So, what did he tell you?

686
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:17,578
Me? Nothing. Nothing at all.

687
00:41:17,712 --> 00:41:19,580
Nothing about an escape plan?

688
00:41:19,714 --> 00:41:22,083
Nothing about some kind
of elaborate breakout costume?

689
00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:23,617
No.

690
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:25,152
Well, how come, every time,

691
00:41:25,286 --> 00:41:27,321
you seem to be at the center
of these things

692
00:41:27,455 --> 00:41:29,790
and then miraculously
you know nothing about it?

693
00:41:29,924 --> 00:41:32,426
Maybe I'm lucky.

694
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,528
Yeah, right.

695
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:38,332
You-you said, um...

696
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:40,601
...the reports coming out

697
00:41:40,735 --> 00:41:42,870
of San Quentin are bananas?

698
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:44,772
What-what do...
what do you mean by "bananas"?

699
00:41:44,905 --> 00:41:46,207
Remember when I asked you
a similar question...

700
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,076
- Uh-huh.
- ...the day you interviewed him?

701
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:51,178
Information is currency.

702
00:41:51,312 --> 00:41:53,714
You of all people
should know that.

703
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:55,750
Come on.

704
00:41:58,819 --> 00:42:00,755
I thought he'd come
to try to find the man

705
00:42:00,888 --> 00:42:04,725
that nearly got him executed,
but I guess not.

706
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:06,560
I'd lay low if I was you.

707
00:42:06,694 --> 00:42:09,330
I'll see myself out.

708
00:42:18,706 --> 00:42:20,007
Okay, think.

709
00:42:20,141 --> 00:42:21,809
Think, think,
think, think, think.

710
00:42:21,942 --> 00:42:23,811
What would Venom do?

711
00:42:23,944 --> 00:42:25,646
He would find you
before you find me,

712
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,381
and he would eat your face!
Damn.

713
00:42:27,516 --> 00:42:29,417
All right.

714
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,252
<i>Who do we leave behind,</i>

715
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:33,220
<i>and how do we leave them?</i>

716
00:42:33,354 --> 00:42:35,956
- <i>A connubial bed, empty...</i>
- "Connubial bed."

717
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,426
- <i>...left to rot...</i>
- Is it marriage? What...

718
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,362
<i>...waiting in the darkness for
the rescuer who never comes.</i>

719
00:42:41,495 --> 00:42:42,830
I don't understand.

720
00:42:42,963 --> 00:42:46,734
"That circle of hell..."

721
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:49,036
<i>Because of you.</i>

722
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:53,074
- <i>You and I are the same.</i>
- "With one bright light"?

723
00:42:53,207 --> 00:42:55,209
<i>Twisted insides, mean daddies.</i>

724
00:42:55,342 --> 00:42:56,644
"Bright light."

725
00:42:56,777 --> 00:42:59,814
<i>You feel like home to me.</i>

726
00:42:59,947 --> 00:43:02,483
- <i>Like family.</i>
- St. Estes.

727
00:43:21,402 --> 00:43:23,204
<i>Crapola!</i>

728
00:43:23,337 --> 00:43:25,639
<i>Another one bites the dust.</i>

729
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,558
Look at all these weirdos.

730
00:43:43,691 --> 00:43:45,493
My kind of people.

731
00:43:46,894 --> 00:43:49,296
- Nice costume.
- Hey!

732
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:51,265
Awesome work.

733
00:43:51,398 --> 00:43:53,535
Greatest costume ever.
Oh, my God.

734
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:56,505
- Oh.
- Is that Japanese?

735
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:58,439
No, I made it myself.

736
00:43:58,573 --> 00:44:00,609
- Hey.
- Who, me?

737
00:44:00,741 --> 00:44:02,611
Hello, gorgeous.

738
00:44:02,743 --> 00:44:04,613
Sorry, no, you're not my type.

739
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:08,482
I am out of the Eddie closet.

740
00:44:33,741 --> 00:44:36,810
Hello, darlin'.

741
00:44:36,944 --> 00:44:38,812
Ooh, racer red.

742
00:44:38,946 --> 00:44:40,681
Got to have it.

743
00:44:45,753 --> 00:44:48,489
<i>Let's get this party started.</i>

744
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:52,826
Oh, hell yes.

745
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,395
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

746
00:44:54,529 --> 00:44:56,197
Hey! Stop!

747
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,065
Stop that! Stop! Stop!

748
00:44:58,199 --> 00:44:59,733
Ah, shit.

749
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:08,275
- You are real.
- I am.

750
00:45:08,409 --> 00:45:11,712
And once I kill that thing
that made me,

751
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:14,415
we will be indestructible.

752
00:45:15,684 --> 00:45:18,786
I know where to find him,
but first,

753
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:22,823
I need you to help me find
something I lost.

754
00:45:22,957 --> 00:45:25,492

- Deal.

Thank you, one person.

772
00:46:29,758 --> 00:46:31,760
Eddie was wrong.

773
00:46:33,427 --> 00:46:37,097
He kept me hidden
because he was ashamed.

774
00:46:39,033 --> 00:46:40,901
But look at me now.

775
00:46:41,035 --> 00:46:43,904
You love me, and I'm free!

776
00:46:45,939 --> 00:46:48,409
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

777
00:46:49,778 --> 00:46:52,647
Stop this cruel treatment
of aliens.

778
00:46:52,781 --> 00:46:54,948
It is wrong.

779
00:46:55,082 --> 00:46:57,351
All of us should be able
to live together

780
00:46:57,484 --> 00:46:59,353
upon this ball of rock.

781
00:47:00,854 --> 00:47:02,356
Yeah!

782
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:05,159
Free to be who we be!

783
00:47:07,529 --> 00:47:08,797
I love you!

784
00:47:08,929 --> 00:47:10,197
I love you, too.

785
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,034
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

786
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:15,704
Lethal Protector out.

787
00:47:25,547 --> 00:47:27,214
Whoa, that was
a hard act to follow.

788
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:31,952
I wish you could have
seen me tonight...

789
00:47:33,987 --> 00:47:35,623
...Eddie.

790
00:48:20,501 --> 00:48:22,570
Holy shit.

791
00:48:24,405 --> 00:48:26,641
- Mulligan.
- <i>Uh, it's Eddie Brock here.</i>

792
00:48:26,775 --> 00:48:28,308
Look, uh, this may be
a long shot,

793
00:48:28,442 --> 00:48:29,744
but I-I think
I may have found something.

794
00:48:29,878 --> 00:48:31,478
Go on, Eddie. What do you got?

795
00:48:31,613 --> 00:48:33,213
<i>Last time I spoke to Kasady,
he was talking to me</i>

796
00:48:33,347 --> 00:48:35,449
about connubial beds
and-and marriage.

797
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,217
And, uh, it didn't make
a whole lot of sense to me,

798
00:48:37,351 --> 00:48:39,953
but, um, I'm here at St. Estes,
and I found this, uh...

799
00:48:40,087 --> 00:48:42,757
<i>Well, I'm standing
in front of a... of a...</i>

800
00:48:42,891 --> 00:48:44,458
<i>of a tree,
and I'm-I'm looking at it.</i>

801
00:48:44,592 --> 00:48:45,926
<i>It's, uh...
it's got a carving on it.</i>

802
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:50,598
It says "CK loves FB."

803
00:48:50,732 --> 00:48:52,801
I'm thinking that maybe
whoever this FB is

804
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:54,268
might know where he's headed.

805
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:57,938
And, uh... a-and if you can,
I don't know,

806
00:48:58,071 --> 00:48:59,641
pull up some files
from St. Estes,

807
00:48:59,774 --> 00:49:03,477
<i>maybe you can figure out
who this FB is.</i>

808
00:49:03,611 --> 00:49:06,146
FB, that's, uh...
that's Frances Barrison.

809
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,850
Wow. That-that's quick.

810
00:49:08,982 --> 00:49:11,018
Yeah, it's impossible, Eddie.

811
00:49:11,151 --> 00:49:14,254
She's dead.
I, uh... I shot her.

812
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:55,763
Can I help you, sir?

813
00:50:12,279 --> 00:50:14,248
Got any of those internets?

814
00:50:31,465 --> 00:50:33,200
You're alive.

815
00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:45,914
When I get out, I'm gonna
slice your face off

816
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:47,682
and wear it to a party!

817
00:50:47,815 --> 00:50:49,918
You're never getting out
of here, Siegfried.

818
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,719
No one does.

819
00:50:55,957 --> 00:50:58,993
Well, Frances,

820
00:50:59,126 --> 00:51:01,328
<i>it seems your sweetheart
has done a Houdini act</i>

821
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:03,330
<i>over there at San Quentin.</i>

822
00:51:05,132 --> 00:51:07,167
<i>It's all over the news.</i>

823
00:51:07,301 --> 00:51:09,771
<i>Oh, don't get excited.</i>

824
00:51:09,904 --> 00:51:11,739
<i>He's not gonna find you.</i>

825
00:51:15,877 --> 00:51:17,277
<i>Screw you.</i>

826
00:51:17,411 --> 00:51:19,446
<i>How flattering.</i>

827
00:51:19,581 --> 00:51:20,982
But you're not my type.

828
00:51:21,114 --> 00:51:23,051
I wonder where he could be.

829
00:51:26,353 --> 00:51:28,723
<i>I'm right here.</i>

830
00:51:28,856 --> 00:51:30,658
<i>Ta-da.</i>

831
00:51:52,245 --> 00:51:53,447
Hi, baby.

832
00:51:56,584 --> 00:51:58,452
I...

833
00:51:58,586 --> 00:52:01,455
don't want you
to freak out, okay?

834
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:04,759
Um, I'd like you to meet...

835
00:52:04,892 --> 00:52:07,061
Carnage.

836
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,342
That is so hot.

837
00:52:39,627 --> 00:52:40,962
Go!

838
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:54,142
A '66.

839
00:52:54,274 --> 00:52:56,443
My dream car.

840
00:52:56,577 --> 00:52:58,046
Yeah, I remember.

841
00:52:58,178 --> 00:52:59,681
Let's see what you got.

842
00:53:30,377 --> 00:53:32,680
Mm, mm.

843
00:53:38,186 --> 00:53:41,122
Yes, baby!

844
00:53:57,638 --> 00:54:00,608
<i>This is SFPD. Stand down.</i>

845
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,434
Stop!

846
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:28,970
You'll kill him!

847
00:54:29,103 --> 00:54:32,472
<i>She does that
again, I'll eat her face.</i>

848
00:54:34,407 --> 00:54:36,276
He's sensitive to sound.

849
00:54:39,412 --> 00:54:42,650
<i>Stop the vehicle. Stand down.</i>

850
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:52,794
Who said romance was dead?

851
00:54:57,231 --> 00:54:59,567
Hey. No drunks in here.

852
00:55:02,103 --> 00:55:04,972
Help me. Food.

853
00:55:05,106 --> 00:55:06,841
Out. You get out!

854
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:08,810
Chocolate.

855
00:55:11,612 --> 00:55:12,914
Venom?

856
00:55:13,047 --> 00:55:14,615
<i>I'm having trouble</i>

857
00:55:14,749 --> 00:55:17,317
<i>keeping them standing, Mrs. C.</i>

858
00:55:17,450 --> 00:55:19,319
Where's Eddie?

859
00:55:19,452 --> 00:55:22,023
Food.

860
00:55:30,698 --> 00:55:32,733
Monsters!

861
00:55:32,867 --> 00:55:35,402
Monsters everywhere!

862
00:55:35,536 --> 00:55:37,538
They're everywhere!

863
00:55:37,672 --> 00:55:40,074
Monsters!

864
00:55:57,291 --> 00:55:59,060
Put out an APB.

865
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:00,862
Form a perimeter.

866
00:56:00,995 --> 00:56:02,797
Blockade state lines.

867
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:04,732
And bring in Brock.

868
00:56:07,835 --> 00:56:09,670
I'm no use to anybody here.

869
00:56:09,804 --> 00:56:11,038
I'm just wasting your time.

870
00:56:11,172 --> 00:56:12,807
Well, you know
what I keep thinking?

871
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,474
I keep thinking,
"What else is Eddie Brock

872
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:15,977
"not sharing
about Cletus Kasady?

873
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,346
"Now, why was it Eddie
that Cletus wanted

874
00:56:18,478 --> 00:56:20,948
to witness the execution?" Huh?

875
00:56:21,082 --> 00:56:23,184
Bad things happen around you.

876
00:56:23,317 --> 00:56:25,553
Multiple dead bodies
at your building last year,

877
00:56:25,686 --> 00:56:28,623
that bizarre outburst
at the lobster restaurant,

878
00:56:28,756 --> 00:56:31,259
and only you
at the Life Foundation

879
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:33,460
when that rocket exploded.

880
00:56:33,594 --> 00:56:35,529
And now Clyde's found Bonnie,

881
00:56:35,663 --> 00:56:37,265
and there's a dead psychiatrist
at a facility

882
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:38,966
I knew nothing about
until today.

883
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,202
And people are talking
about seeing monsters.

884
00:56:41,335 --> 00:56:44,138
Monsters?
Uh, what-what do you mean...

885
00:56:44,272 --> 00:56:46,140
- what do you mean, "monsters"?
- Monsters, Eddie!

886
00:56:46,274 --> 00:56:48,809
Everywhere Cletus goes,
so goes this supposed monster.

887
00:56:48,943 --> 00:56:51,545
- Oh, God.
- Talk to me, Eddie.

888
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:53,347
Talk to me!

889
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:57,285
How's he doing it, Eddie?

890
00:56:58,686 --> 00:57:00,254
<i>What's the secret?</i>

891
00:57:00,388 --> 00:57:02,390
<i>How's he making people
see things?</i>

892
00:57:02,523 --> 00:57:03,758
All right, I, uh...

893
00:57:05,293 --> 00:57:07,128
I can't answer any more
of your questions

894
00:57:07,261 --> 00:57:09,063
without making my phone call.

895
00:57:14,001 --> 00:57:15,970
I'll get you your phone call.

896
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:18,239
But you know
what secrets want, Eddie?

897
00:57:18,372 --> 00:57:19,941
They want out.

898
00:57:20,074 --> 00:57:21,776
That's why they're
so hard to keep.

899
00:57:30,818 --> 00:57:32,853
Eddie asked you to do this?

900
00:57:32,987 --> 00:57:34,454
And he doesn't have anyone else
that can help him?

901
00:57:34,588 --> 00:57:35,623
We're gonna be late
for the party.

902
00:57:35,756 --> 00:57:36,958
He's in trouble, Dan.

903
00:57:37,091 --> 00:57:38,659
Yeah, trouble is his thing.

904
00:57:40,061 --> 00:57:41,796
Are there gonna be
aliens again?

905
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:43,931
No, of course not.

906
00:57:45,498 --> 00:57:47,368
I'd like to speak to him alone.

907
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,370
Well, your duty of honesty
supersedes

908
00:57:49,502 --> 00:57:52,506
your duty to the client
if somebody gets harmed.

909
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:54,842
They teach you that
at posh school?

910
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:57,845
Oh, hey. Anne.

911
00:57:57,979 --> 00:58:00,348
Hey, Anne, thank you so...
thank you so much for coming.

912
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,517
Boy,
that little guy's a charmer, huh?

913
00:58:03,651 --> 00:58:05,920
How much do I need to worry
about you right now?

914
00:58:06,053 --> 00:58:07,321
Uh, I-I messed up.

915
00:58:07,455 --> 00:58:08,856
Okay. How badly?

916
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:11,425
Uh, it couldn't be worse,
and it's-it's all on me.

917
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:12,827
Whatever you did, Eddie,

918
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,662
you just need to tell
the cops the truth.

919
00:58:14,795 --> 00:58:16,630
No. No.
No, I can't tell them

920
00:58:16,764 --> 00:58:18,632
that they are chasing
a serial killer

921
00:58:18,766 --> 00:58:22,036
who's also
got an alien inside of him.

922
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:24,572
And he's capable
of killing everybody.

923
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:28,642
Venom.

924
00:58:28,776 --> 00:58:30,845
Talk to me. What's happening?

925
00:58:30,978 --> 00:58:33,681
No, he's-he's not here.
He's not here.

926
00:58:35,816 --> 00:58:37,918
Is this, like, an "I'm lying"
"He's not here,"

927
00:58:38,052 --> 00:58:39,687
or is this a real
"He's not here"?

928
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,988
He's not here.

929
00:58:41,122 --> 00:58:42,590
Jesus Christ, Eddie.

930
00:58:42,723 --> 00:58:44,625
<i>St. Estes fire. All units.</i>

931
00:58:44,759 --> 00:58:46,093
What the actual f...

932
00:58:46,227 --> 00:58:47,928
- Eddie, think. Think.
- I don't know. I don't know.

933
00:58:48,062 --> 00:58:49,730
All I know that...
i-is that he can't go long

934
00:58:49,864 --> 00:58:51,399
without eating food, right,
so he's eating chicken

935
00:58:51,532 --> 00:58:53,067
and he eats chocolate,
and that's it.

936
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,070
And that is only if he's still
observing the rules.

937
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,975
We need to find him.

938
00:59:01,108 --> 00:59:03,210
You mean I need to find him.

939
00:59:03,344 --> 00:59:04,912
Yeah, you need
to find him, please.

940
00:59:05,046 --> 00:59:06,714
And then I-I... I will fix it.

941
00:59:06,847 --> 00:59:09,150
- I'll try.
- Thank you.

942
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:13,320
Mrs. Chen.

943
00:59:13,454 --> 00:59:15,056
- Who's asking?
- It's me.

944
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:18,292
What do you want?

945
00:59:18,426 --> 00:59:20,161
- Oh, she's a charmer.
- Okay, listen.

946
00:59:20,294 --> 00:59:21,228
You broke Eddie's heart.

947
00:59:21,362 --> 00:59:22,596
Okay, I actually
don't have time

948
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:23,864
to explain why
that's wildly off the mark.

949
00:59:23,998 --> 00:59:24,999
Do you know where Venom is?

950
00:59:25,132 --> 00:59:26,867
You want to break
his heart, too?

951
00:59:27,001 --> 00:59:28,636
I'm not gonna get into
who did what to who.

952
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:30,438
Eddie said that he might be
here because of the chocolate.

953
00:59:30,571 --> 00:59:32,073
I-I just need to speak
with the alien.

954
00:59:32,206 --> 00:59:33,908
Wha... Hey, you said there
weren't gonna be any aliens.

955
00:59:34,041 --> 00:59:36,043
- I meant more aliens.
- <i>Breaking news.</i>

956
00:59:36,177 --> 00:59:37,311
<i>The mayor has issued
a curfew...</i>

957
00:59:37,445 --> 00:59:39,548
Can you turn
the volume up, please?

958
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,415
<i>Kasady and
Barrison should be treated</i>

959
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:43,984
<i>as armed
and extremely dangerous.</i>

960
00:59:44,118 --> 00:59:46,454
<i>An all-out manhunt
continues tonight.</i>

961
00:59:46,587 --> 00:59:47,955
So?

962
00:59:48,089 --> 00:59:50,424
- Cletus has a symbiote.
- Oh, my God.

963
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,660
Any other information you're
pathologically lying about?

964
00:59:52,793 --> 00:59:54,495
- Pussy.
- Excuse me?

965
00:59:54,628 --> 00:59:55,564
Eddie needs Venom.

966
00:59:55,696 --> 00:59:56,797
She just called me a pussy.

967
00:59:56,931 --> 00:59:58,199
He said he didn't need him,

968
00:59:58,332 --> 00:59:59,967
that life was better
without him.

969
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:03,237
Okay, I don't understand.
What do you care...

970
01:00:03,370 --> 01:00:05,272
Oh, wait a second.

971
01:00:07,374 --> 01:00:09,210
You get out here right now.

972
01:00:11,078 --> 01:00:13,548
Do you... D-Do you see that?

973
01:00:13,681 --> 01:00:16,250
- Seriously, do you see that?
- Yeah, hon, I've seen it.

974
01:00:16,383 --> 01:00:18,385
Eddie's going to
have to fight this battle

975
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:20,555
all by his little bitch self.

976
01:00:20,688 --> 01:00:22,389
Oh, don't be a big baby.
Go help your friend.

977
01:00:22,524 --> 01:00:24,992
He said I couldn't
get a job fixing toilets.

978
01:00:26,127 --> 01:00:27,261
Cletus will come for him.

979
01:00:27,394 --> 01:00:28,696
He won't survive without you.

980
01:00:28,829 --> 01:00:30,599
Of course he won't.

981
01:00:30,731 --> 01:00:33,634
Because I am the hero
of the two of us.

982
01:00:36,137 --> 01:00:38,139
Yeah, you're the big sexy hero.

983
01:00:40,474 --> 01:00:42,109
You're the coolest,

984
01:00:42,243 --> 01:00:44,613
you're the hottest,
and you're the bravest.

985
01:00:44,745 --> 01:00:46,046
I am.

986
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:47,648
You know, I'm still
standing right here.

987
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:50,184
No one likes you, Dan!

988
01:00:50,317 --> 01:00:52,186
I love seeing you in action.

989
01:00:57,258 --> 01:00:59,927
Let's go save that asshole.

990
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:08,869
I promised
we'd be free from here.

991
01:01:09,003 --> 01:01:12,806
And we'd walk to
the cathedral on the hill.

992
01:01:15,075 --> 01:01:16,645
A wedding.

993
01:01:16,777 --> 01:01:18,379
Three guests.

994
01:01:18,513 --> 01:01:20,781
One for each of us.

995
01:01:20,915 --> 01:01:23,518
The cop that took my eye.

996
01:01:23,652 --> 01:01:25,819
Eddie Brock.

997
01:01:25,953 --> 01:01:28,389
And Venom.

998
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:32,693
A red wedding.

999
01:01:35,729 --> 01:01:38,667
You... you didn't find him?

1000
01:01:50,244 --> 01:01:52,279
Oh, my Lord.

1001
01:01:52,413 --> 01:01:54,081
What happened?

1002
01:02:04,358 --> 01:02:05,893
Hey, Dan.

1003
01:02:06,026 --> 01:02:07,494
All right, let's go.

1004
01:02:07,629 --> 01:02:09,496
<i>I'm not talking to him!</i>

1005
01:02:09,631 --> 01:02:11,533
Well, he doesn't want
to come out.

1006
01:02:11,666 --> 01:02:13,234
What-what do you mean?
We-we have to leave right now

1007
01:02:13,367 --> 01:02:14,768
'cause Cletus is gonna
wipe the city out.

1008
01:02:14,902 --> 01:02:17,204
<i>We're not doing
shit until he apologizes.</i>

1009
01:02:17,338 --> 01:02:19,608
So, he's looking for an apology.
Look, I know that amends aren't

1010
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,108
- really your thing, but...
- An apology?

1011
01:02:21,242 --> 01:02:22,843
What, like, as in right...
right now, an apology?

1012
01:02:22,977 --> 01:02:26,247
<i>I need him to beg.</i>

1013
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,382
Fine, I will be
the bigger of us.

1014
01:02:28,516 --> 01:02:31,919
<i>I will always be the bigger of
us, but go on.</i>

1015
01:02:32,052 --> 01:02:33,287
What did he say?
What is he saying?

1016
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,089
He said he's listening
very sincerely.

1017
01:02:35,222 --> 01:02:36,423
All right, listen to this.

1018
01:02:36,558 --> 01:02:37,659
I am sorry.

1019
01:02:37,825 --> 01:02:39,594
<i>Not the right tone.</i>

1020
01:02:39,728 --> 01:02:41,161
I'm sorry.

1021
01:02:41,295 --> 01:02:42,396
<i>Nope.</i>

1022
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:44,231
I-I am sorry.

1023
01:02:44,365 --> 01:02:45,766
So weird.

1024
01:02:45,899 --> 01:02:47,067
I'm sorry!

1025
01:02:47,201 --> 01:02:48,402
I don't know why
you're shouting at me.

1026
01:02:48,536 --> 01:02:49,803
Well, 'cause...
Okay, well, fine.

1027
01:02:49,937 --> 01:02:52,139
I was a... I was a loser
before I met you.

1028
01:02:52,273 --> 01:02:53,841
- <i>Yep. That's right.</i>
- And, uh...

1029
01:02:53,974 --> 01:02:55,677
and now I am someone.

1030
01:02:57,811 --> 01:03:00,180
All right? You made me special.

1031
01:03:00,314 --> 01:03:01,415
<i>Damn right.</i>

1032
01:03:01,549 --> 01:03:02,684
Why don't you put
a cherry on it?

1033
01:03:02,816 --> 01:03:05,720
A cherry on that? Right. Um...

1034
01:03:05,853 --> 01:03:07,722
I'm...

1035
01:03:07,855 --> 01:03:10,625
I-I am truly very sorry
for everything that I said.

1036
01:03:10,759 --> 01:03:12,661
- <i>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</i>
- Everything that I did not say.

1037
01:03:12,793 --> 01:03:14,261
- Everything that I did, you know.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1038
01:03:14,395 --> 01:03:15,664
And probably everything
that I-I did...

1039
01:03:15,796 --> 01:03:17,131
I did not... I did not do.

1040
01:03:17,264 --> 01:03:18,932
- <i>Mm...</i>
- Yeah, he's thinking.

1041
01:03:19,066 --> 01:03:21,835
- <i>Hmm...</i>
- Come on. Come on.

1042
01:03:23,871 --> 01:03:25,406
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Whoa.

1043
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,408
Whoa! Oh.

1044
01:03:27,542 --> 01:03:28,643
Oh, no.

1045
01:03:28,777 --> 01:03:30,110
<i>Kiss her.</i>

1046
01:03:30,244 --> 01:03:31,912
Are you gonna...
are you gonna kiss me now?

1047
01:03:32,046 --> 01:03:33,648
- No.
- No?

1048
01:03:33,782 --> 01:03:35,349
Oh, God,
I'm never doing that again.

1049
01:03:35,482 --> 01:03:36,850
God, well, maybe never.
I don't know.

1050
01:03:36,984 --> 01:03:38,118
Honestly, it's really fun.

1051
01:03:38,252 --> 01:03:39,788
<i>If we save the day,</i>

1052
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,055
<i>can we call ourselves
the Lethal Protector?</i>

1053
01:03:41,188 --> 01:03:43,290
That is so '80s.
Dan, pack quickly.

1054
01:03:43,424 --> 01:03:45,660
Don't stay.
And if for any reason...

1055
01:03:45,794 --> 01:03:47,061
Fire and sound.

1056
01:03:47,194 --> 01:03:48,862
"Fire and sound"?
Is that a band?

1057
01:03:48,996 --> 01:03:50,632
- No, it's what kills them.
- Yeah.

1058
01:03:50,765 --> 01:03:52,366
Okay, look, man, I've got her.

1059
01:03:55,603 --> 01:03:57,037
<i>Not sorry.</i>

1060
01:03:57,171 --> 01:03:59,173
- Oh...
- God, I'm so sorry.

1061
01:03:59,306 --> 01:04:01,408
Man, those two need some
serious couples counseling.

1062
01:04:05,513 --> 01:04:07,981
I'm pulling up to Brock's now.

1063
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:14,121
Shit. Oh, my God.

1064
01:04:16,524 --> 01:04:19,393
Kasady, place your hands
on your head!

1065
01:04:20,528 --> 01:04:22,496
Which, um...

1066
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:24,632
hands?

1067
01:04:24,766 --> 01:04:26,033
What the...

1068
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:32,973
We found you.

1069
01:04:33,107 --> 01:04:35,976
Shriek will be so pleased.

1070
01:04:40,548 --> 01:04:42,550
Yoo-hoo!

1071
01:04:43,984 --> 01:04:46,053
Brockalicious.

1072
01:05:01,335 --> 01:05:03,805
Bling-a-ling.

1073
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:08,710
Now, whose finger
were you meant for?

1074
01:05:12,913 --> 01:05:14,783
Ah.

1075
01:05:14,915 --> 01:05:17,752
A nice, shiny lure

1076
01:05:17,886 --> 01:05:20,220
for a little fishy.

1077
01:05:27,027 --> 01:05:29,764
Okay. Here we go, buddy.

1078
01:05:38,372 --> 01:05:40,307
Hello, Anne.

1079
01:05:40,441 --> 01:05:42,911
I just incapacitated
your boyfriend.

1080
01:05:43,043 --> 01:05:44,746
Now, he'll be okay...

1081
01:05:44,879 --> 01:05:47,414
with an answer about
where Eddie Brock is.

1082
01:05:47,549 --> 01:05:50,919
Well,
I'm sure as shit not gonna tell you that.

1083
01:05:51,051 --> 01:05:52,787
It's a shame to hurt you.

1084
01:05:59,561 --> 01:06:03,330
Tell Brock
Cletus will make a swap.

1085
01:06:03,464 --> 01:06:05,800
Her head for his.

1086
01:06:07,501 --> 01:06:09,303
He's gonna kill you both.

1087
01:06:09,436 --> 01:06:11,639
Peeps have tried that already.

1088
01:06:11,773 --> 01:06:13,808
Botched it.

1089
01:06:25,653 --> 01:06:27,522
<i>They can't find him!</i>

1090
01:06:27,655 --> 01:06:29,524
They are hunting us,
too, buddy.

1091
01:06:31,425 --> 01:06:32,993
Come on, where are you?

1092
01:06:38,733 --> 01:06:40,602
Hey, Dan. What's going on?

1093
01:06:40,735 --> 01:06:42,737
- Eddie, they got her.
- <i>Huh?</i>

1094
01:06:42,871 --> 01:06:44,672
- They've taken Anne!
- Calm down.

1095
01:06:44,806 --> 01:06:46,039
Yeah, they took her
to their wedding.

1096
01:06:46,173 --> 01:06:47,742
- They took her where?
- <i>Their wedding.</i>

1097
01:06:47,876 --> 01:06:49,744
- Grace Cathedral. Hurry.
- <i>We're on our way.</i>

1098
01:06:49,878 --> 01:06:52,680
All right, it looks like
we are going to a wedding.

1099
01:06:52,814 --> 01:06:54,682
<i>Oh, will there be canapés?</i>

1100
01:06:54,816 --> 01:06:56,518
You bet your ass.

1101
01:07:32,654 --> 01:07:35,924
That distant cathedral

1102
01:07:36,056 --> 01:07:38,258
is all I see.

1103
01:07:40,494 --> 01:07:44,364
Fractured angel,

1104
01:07:44,498 --> 01:07:46,233
the other part of me.

1105
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:50,237
D-Dearly beloved...

1106
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,040
Gifts first.

1107
01:07:52,172 --> 01:07:53,942
Actually, traditionally...

1108
01:07:54,074 --> 01:07:56,076
Shut your mouth.

1109
01:07:58,111 --> 01:07:59,246
Father.

1110
01:07:59,379 --> 01:08:03,651
Baby, I got for you
what you want most.

1111
01:08:03,785 --> 01:08:05,152
The cop?

1112
01:08:05,285 --> 01:08:06,754
The cop.

1113
01:08:06,888 --> 01:08:08,422
Continue, Father.

1114
01:08:08,556 --> 01:08:12,426
Dearly beloved, if anyone
objects to this marriage,

1115
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:15,162
speak now
or forever hold th-their...

1116
01:08:17,732 --> 01:08:19,067
Where is she?!

1117
01:08:22,436 --> 01:08:24,304
There you are.

1118
01:08:24,438 --> 01:08:26,306
Death to you, Father.

1119
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,307
No!

1120
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:29,109
Not you, Father.

1121
01:08:29,242 --> 01:08:31,746
You, Father.

1122
01:08:31,879 --> 01:08:34,281
Oh, shit!

1123
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:35,984
Uh, where you going?
What are you doing?

1124
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:37,719
<i>This is much
worse than I thought.</i>

1125
01:08:37,852 --> 01:08:40,287
<i>That is a red one. Wow. Uh...</i>

1126
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:42,557
- Red one?
- <i>We should leave immediately.</i>

1127
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:44,324
<i>Annie will get over it.</i>

1128
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:46,561
<i>We never liked her anyway.
So let's go.</i>

1129
01:08:46,694 --> 01:08:47,962
Now?

1130
01:08:48,096 --> 01:08:49,097
<i>Congratulations
to the happy couple.</i>

1131
01:08:49,229 --> 01:08:50,430
<i>We are leaving.</i>

1132
01:08:50,565 --> 01:08:52,332
Eddie! Yoo-hoo.

1133
01:08:52,466 --> 01:08:55,036
I'll be right with you,
all right? Mm.

1134
01:08:55,168 --> 01:08:57,038
Okay, you need
to come out right now.

1135
01:08:57,170 --> 01:08:59,807
Because I am feeling super,
super vulnerable right here.

1136
01:08:59,941 --> 01:09:01,609
Brock's just like you?

1137
01:09:01,743 --> 01:09:02,977
Not for long.

1138
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:07,015
Eddie, over here!

1139
01:09:07,147 --> 01:09:09,050
You need to come out right now.

1140
01:09:09,182 --> 01:09:11,886
I will let you eat everybody.
You can eat 'em all!

1141
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:14,722
Apart from him in the robe.
You cannot eat him.

1142
01:09:14,856 --> 01:09:16,524
- <i>Promise?</i>
- I promise.

1143
01:09:19,594 --> 01:09:20,928
<i>Thank you.</i>

1144
01:09:34,942 --> 01:09:36,711
Baby!

1145
01:09:36,844 --> 01:09:38,680
Shut your mouth.

1146
01:09:40,014 --> 01:09:42,016
Marriage trouble already?

1147
01:09:43,985 --> 01:09:45,485
Time to die.

1148
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:47,155
<i>That's the spirit.</i>

1149
01:09:47,287 --> 01:09:50,190
I mean us.
We are going to die.

1150
01:10:31,999 --> 01:10:33,701
I-I killed you.

1151
01:10:33,835 --> 01:10:36,571
Well, you can't kill a ghost.

1152
01:10:39,741 --> 01:10:44,277
You, kill him,
but keep your mouth shut.

1153
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:47,014
<i>Our wife knows
what she's doing.</i>

1154
01:10:47,148 --> 01:10:49,117
Just turn it down.

1155
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:51,819
Who do you think
you're talking to?

1156
01:10:51,953 --> 01:10:54,589
- Stop him.
- My cop!

1157
01:11:01,394 --> 01:11:02,897
Honeymoon over?

1158
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:04,732
Oh, God. No.

1159
01:11:07,267 --> 01:11:09,003
Power up.

1160
01:11:09,137 --> 01:11:10,171
<i>No!</i>

1161
01:11:27,287 --> 01:11:29,957
Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
Cletus Kasady...

1162
01:11:42,069 --> 01:11:46,974
What do they say
about an eye for an eye?

1163
01:11:56,818 --> 01:11:58,485
Fire and sound.

1164
01:11:58,619 --> 01:11:59,720
Except without the sound.

1165
01:12:03,124 --> 01:12:04,457
Baby!

1166
01:12:07,195 --> 01:12:08,229
Cletus!

1167
01:12:38,358 --> 01:12:40,194
<i>Mano a mano,</i> Brock.

1168
01:12:46,834 --> 01:12:49,670
You know how I spent
my endless days?

1169
01:13:00,181 --> 01:13:01,849
I spent them thinking about

1170
01:13:01,983 --> 01:13:05,553
how you only told
one side of the story.

1171
01:13:18,699 --> 01:13:22,469
You didn't write about the part
where Cletus was abused

1172
01:13:22,603 --> 01:13:25,773
by Mommy, Daddy and Granny!

1173
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:03,744
You didn't tell the world
how he was a scared little boy

1174
01:14:03,878 --> 01:14:06,314
that no one cared about

1175
01:14:06,446 --> 01:14:09,482
and no one came to save!

1176
01:14:13,821 --> 01:14:17,792
You never asked yourself why!

1177
01:14:17,925 --> 01:14:21,329
That's bad journalism!

1178
01:14:28,269 --> 01:14:30,905
Oh, happy days.

1179
01:14:39,947 --> 01:14:42,516
I'm not a crazy man,

1180
01:14:43,617 --> 01:14:47,088
but I am a vengeful one.

1181
01:14:51,225 --> 01:14:53,427
You're going to watch her die.

1182
01:14:59,633 --> 01:15:02,136
Anne! Anne!

1183
01:15:18,019 --> 01:15:18,886
Do something!

1184
01:15:21,022 --> 01:15:24,558
Eddie, I'm afraid
we cannot beat them.

1185
01:15:29,864 --> 01:15:33,200
Baby, that's too much.

1186
01:15:34,301 --> 01:15:36,303
You got to stop him.

1187
01:15:36,437 --> 01:15:38,172
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1188
01:15:38,305 --> 01:15:40,174
I'll shut her up for good.

1189
01:15:41,475 --> 01:15:44,078
No, stop! You're hurting her!

1190
01:15:48,549 --> 01:15:49,583
<i>Get up!</i>

1191
01:15:49,717 --> 01:15:51,552
I can't.

1192
01:15:52,853 --> 01:15:54,755
<i>Look. Look.</i>

1193
01:15:54,889 --> 01:15:56,724
<i>They're not symbiotic.</i>

1194
01:15:57,858 --> 01:15:58,859
Get away from her!

1195
01:15:58,993 --> 01:16:00,027
Shut up.

1196
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:02,063
<i>Get your hands off my wife!</i>

1197
01:16:04,398 --> 01:16:06,434
<i>They're not a match.</i>

1198
01:16:06,567 --> 01:16:08,102
We are.

1199
01:16:08,235 --> 01:16:10,771
<i>That's right. We are.</i>

1200
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,375
Together, we are...

1201
01:16:16,343 --> 01:16:18,379
The Lethal Protector!

1202
01:17:35,289 --> 01:17:39,293
Let there be carnage!

1203
01:18:01,115 --> 01:18:03,585
I got you. You okay?

1204
01:18:33,682 --> 01:18:37,151
Father, one of us must die.

1205
01:18:37,284 --> 01:18:39,420
<i>We need fire.</i>

1206
01:18:42,823 --> 01:18:45,259
Or sound.

1207
01:18:59,574 --> 01:19:01,543
No!

1208
01:19:18,292 --> 01:19:21,128
Holy mackerel.

1209
01:19:57,965 --> 01:20:00,434
He did not taste good.

1210
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:14,915
I'm a killer

1211
01:20:15,049 --> 01:20:17,652
with or without
the monster, Eddie.

1212
01:20:19,887 --> 01:20:21,623
You know what I really wanted?

1213
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:24,858
No. What was it, Cletus?

1214
01:20:24,992 --> 01:20:27,762
I told you,
but you weren't listening.

1215
01:20:28,896 --> 01:20:30,431
Well, I'm listening now.

1216
01:20:31,899 --> 01:20:34,268
I wanted your friendship.

1217
01:20:36,638 --> 01:20:38,673
I'm sorry, Cletus.

1218
01:20:41,175 --> 01:20:42,876
Fuck this guy.

1219
01:21:05,032 --> 01:21:07,134
You in there,
get him out of here.

1220
01:21:07,267 --> 01:21:08,969
They're gonna come
for you both.

1221
01:21:09,103 --> 01:21:10,638
I know.

1222
01:21:12,272 --> 01:21:14,308
Hey, Anne.

1223
01:21:14,441 --> 01:21:15,943
Take care.

1224
01:21:19,647 --> 01:21:21,181
Yeah, you, too, champ.

1225
01:21:21,315 --> 01:21:22,717
Dan!

1226
01:21:22,851 --> 01:21:24,351
You take care, too.

1227
01:21:24,485 --> 01:21:26,053
Thanks.

1228
01:21:26,186 --> 01:21:27,756
I like you.

1229
01:21:27,888 --> 01:21:29,557
We totally
didn't need him, though.

1230
01:21:29,691 --> 01:21:33,260
Honestly, I think he was more
of a hindrance than a help.

1231
01:21:46,841 --> 01:21:48,710
Monsters.

1232
01:21:58,452 --> 01:22:00,254
That there is Don Quixote,

1233
01:22:00,387 --> 01:22:03,758
and the guy next to him
is, uh, S-Sancho Panza.

1234
01:22:03,892 --> 01:22:05,426
They're two
very different people

1235
01:22:05,560 --> 01:22:08,061
who have very different takes
on the world.

1236
01:22:08,195 --> 01:22:10,931
D-Different ways
of doing things.

1237
01:22:11,064 --> 01:22:13,400
Sometimes they didn't like
each other a whole lot,

1238
01:22:13,535 --> 01:22:16,103
but ultimately...

1239
01:22:16,236 --> 01:22:19,072
they worked together to bring
out the best in each other.

1240
01:22:20,508 --> 01:22:24,244
<i>Eddie, the time has come.</i>

1241
01:22:24,378 --> 01:22:26,480
<i>I must go alone.</i>

1242
01:22:26,614 --> 01:22:28,550
<i>It is me they want.</i>

1243
01:22:28,683 --> 01:22:30,284
Yeah.

1244
01:22:31,753 --> 01:22:34,421
Well, my dear Sancho,

1245
01:22:34,556 --> 01:22:37,792
facts are the enemy of truth.

1246
01:22:37,926 --> 01:22:39,661
<i>What does that even mean?</i>

1247
01:22:39,794 --> 01:22:41,596
It means...

1248
01:22:42,864 --> 01:22:46,568
It means that we are...

1249
01:22:46,701 --> 01:22:48,402
- frien...
- <i>Fugitives!</i>

1250
01:22:48,536 --> 01:22:50,738
Um, yeah. Yeah.

1251
01:22:50,872 --> 01:22:52,907
- <i>On the run.</i>
- That, too.

1252
01:23:06,987 --> 01:23:09,657
Thank you
for bringing me here.

1253
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:12,159
Yeah, you're welcome, buddy.

1254
01:23:12,292 --> 01:23:14,361
- It's beautiful, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

1255
01:23:14,495 --> 01:23:17,832
I'm sorry that we can't
do anything about the old

1256
01:23:17,966 --> 01:23:20,300
"wind in your hair"
situation, but...

1257
01:23:20,434 --> 01:23:23,972
Osho says,
when you love someone,

1258
01:23:24,104 --> 01:23:26,875
- you accept the whole person...
- Osho?

1259
01:23:27,007 --> 01:23:29,511
...with all of their defects.

1260
01:23:29,644 --> 01:23:31,044
"Defects." Hmm.

1261
01:23:31,178 --> 01:23:32,580
Nobody is perfect.

1262
01:23:32,714 --> 01:23:34,147
Just go back.
Go back a minute.

1263
01:23:34,281 --> 01:23:36,718
You telling me...
you just said that you love me.

1264
01:23:36,851 --> 01:23:38,385
- Um...
- You did.

1265
01:23:40,788 --> 01:23:42,557
Where will we go?

1266
01:23:42,690 --> 01:23:45,560
I don't know. I don't know.

1267
01:23:45,693 --> 01:23:48,262
Anywhere that needs
a Lethal Protector, I suppose.

1268
01:23:48,395 --> 01:23:51,031
Oh! You really meant it!

1269
01:23:51,164 --> 01:23:52,734
Yeah.

1270
01:23:52,867 --> 01:23:55,168
We will need a cape
and a mask.

1271
01:23:56,571 --> 01:23:57,906
No.

1272
01:23:58,038 --> 01:24:00,107
No, I think you got
that covered. We're good.

1273
01:26:42,804 --> 01:26:44,138
<i>Maximiliano.</i>

1274
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:47,240
<i>Estás embarazada.</i>

1275
01:26:47,374 --> 01:26:48,743
<i>¿Estás esperando un hijo mío?</i>

1276
01:27:04,659 --> 01:27:06,728
<i>Oh, I love this show.</i>

1277
01:27:06,861 --> 01:27:09,163
Yeah.

1278
01:27:09,296 --> 01:27:11,866
<i>Maximiliano's feelings
are not being validated.</i>

1279
01:27:11,999 --> 01:27:13,568
Yeah, well,
he never should've kept

1280
01:27:13,701 --> 01:27:15,837
such an insane secret, man.

1281
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:18,005
<i>We all have a past, Eddie.</i>

1282
01:27:19,473 --> 01:27:22,677
What, are you...
you hiding stuff from me?

1283
01:27:22,810 --> 01:27:25,012
<i>80 billion light-years</i>

1284
01:27:25,146 --> 01:27:28,049
<i>of hive knowledge
across universes</i>

1285
01:27:28,182 --> 01:27:31,152
<i>would explode
your tiny little brain.</i>

1286
01:27:31,284 --> 01:27:33,554
What-what does that
even mean, man?

1287
01:27:33,688 --> 01:27:36,057
<i>Well,
let me give you a taste, then.</i>

1288
01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:39,060
<i>Just the smallest fraction
of the things</i>

1289
01:27:39,193 --> 01:27:41,629
<i>we symbiotes have experienced.</i>

1290
01:27:41,763 --> 01:27:43,798
- Okay.
- <i>Ready, Eddie?</i>

1291
01:27:43,931 --> 01:27:45,099
Yeah.

1292
01:27:51,906 --> 01:27:53,141
Whoa.

1293
01:27:53,273 --> 01:27:55,275
<i>What's happening?</i>

1294
01:27:55,408 --> 01:27:57,178
No, no, no, no.

1295
01:27:57,310 --> 01:27:58,813
No, no, no, no, no.

1296
01:28:00,581 --> 01:28:02,449
<i>What the hell is that?!</i>

1297
01:28:02,583 --> 01:28:04,819
Oh, that's a...
that-that's just a towel.

1298
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:07,989
Where are we?

1299
01:28:08,122 --> 01:28:09,957
- Wh-What did you do?
- <i>It wasn't me.</i>

1300
01:28:10,091 --> 01:28:12,260
<i>Incredibly,
this shocking revelation</i>

1301
01:28:12,392 --> 01:28:13,995
<i>brought to life by yours truly
has only raised...</i>

1302
01:28:14,128 --> 01:28:16,296
What? What-what...
what is this?

1303
01:28:16,429 --> 01:28:18,866
<i>...of Peter Parker,</i>

01:28:23,336 --> 01:28:25,039

<i>...his web of lies.</i>

1312
01:28:40,387 --> 01:28:42,489
Dude, what are you doing

1313
01:28:44,324 --> 01:28:45,660
