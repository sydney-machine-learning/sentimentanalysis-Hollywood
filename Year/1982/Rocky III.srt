1
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,191
<i>It's blind instinct.</i>

2
00:00:47,995 --> 00:00:51,328
<i>But now it is Creed coming back</i>
<i>with the left hand!</i>

3
00:00:51,457 --> 00:00:55,585
<i>What's keeping these two guys up?</i>
<i>A tremendous closing moment!</i>

4
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:02,910
<i>Here comes Balboa back,</i>
<i>but the champion's back with another left.</i>

5
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:13,882
<i>A right hand! It's Creed.</i>
<i>Now it's Balboa! Now it's Creed.</i>

6
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:18,009
<i>A tremendous left by Rocky.</i>
<i>They're dead in the centre, toe to toe!</i>

7
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,151
One!

8
00:01:40,496 --> 00:01:41,496
Two!

9
00:01:41,622 --> 00:01:47,495
<i>Creed will retain the title.</i>
<i>If neither gets up, Creed will win the title.</i>

10
00:01:47,837 --> 00:01:50,209
- Four!
- Get up, my man.

11
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:51,964
God!

12
00:01:53,217 --> 00:01:54,217
Six.

13
00:01:54,343 --> 00:01:57,048
<i>Each fighter is trying to beat the count!</i>

14
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,804
Get up there!

15
00:01:59,307 --> 00:02:01,299
Eight!

16
00:02:02,059 --> 00:02:04,597
- Nine!
<i>- The champ is down.</i>

17
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:07,480
Ten!

18
00:02:09,108 --> 00:02:12,109
<i>He's done it at the last second!</i>

19
00:02:12,236 --> 00:02:15,486
<i>He made it!</i>
<i>Rocky Balboa has shocked the world!</i>

20
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:18,651
<i>He is the new heavyweight</i>
<i>champion of the world!</i>

21
00:02:19,869 --> 00:02:22,027
Ladies and gentlemen,

22
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:27,039
in a stunning upset,
scoring a win by knockout,

23
00:02:27,168 --> 00:02:30,453
the new heavyweight
champion of the world,

24
00:02:31,964 --> 00:02:35,583
Rocky Balboa!

25
00:02:36,886 --> 00:02:38,962
Excuse me. Excuse me.

26
00:02:40,014 --> 00:02:44,012
I just wanna say one thing -
to my wife, who's home.

27
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:49,516
Yo, Adrian. I did it!

28
00:02:49,649 --> 00:02:53,018
I love you. I love you.

29
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:56,337
<i>~ Risin' up, back on the street ~</i>

30
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,219
<i>~ Did my time, took my chances ~</i>

31
00:04:01,971 --> 00:04:05,055
<i>~ Went the distance</i>
<i>Now I'm back on my feet ~</i>

32
00:04:05,183 --> 00:04:08,765
<i>~ Just a man and his will to survive ~</i>

33
00:04:10,438 --> 00:04:13,688
<i>~ So many times, it happens too fast ~</i>

34
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:18,151
<i>~ You change your passion for glory ~</i>

35
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,695
<i>~ Don't lose your grip</i>
<i>On the dreams of the past ~</i>

36
00:04:22,825 --> 00:04:27,155
<i>~ You must fight just to keep them alive ~</i>

37
00:04:27,288 --> 00:04:31,333
<i>~ It's the eye of the tiger</i>
<i>It's the thrill of the fight ~</i>

38
00:04:31,459 --> 00:04:35,920
<i>~ Risin' up to the challenge of our rival ~</i>

39
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:40,341
<i>~ And the last known survivor</i>
<i>Stalks his prey in the night ~</i>

40
00:04:40,468 --> 00:04:44,797
<i>~ And he's watching us all with the eye ~</i>

41
00:04:44,931 --> 00:04:46,970
<i>~ Of the tiger ~</i>

42
00:04:50,603 --> 00:04:54,019
<i>~ Face to face, out in the heat ~</i>

43
00:04:54,982 --> 00:04:57,983
<i>~ Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry ~</i>

44
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:02,611
<i>~ They stack the odds</i>
<i>Still we take to the street ~</i>

45
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,820
<i>~ For the kill, with the skill to survive ~</i>

46
00:05:06,994 --> 00:05:10,944
<i>~ It's the eye of the tiger</i>

53
00:05:43,406 --> 00:05:46,656
<i>~ Went the distance</i>

<i>~ The eye of the tiger ~</i>

62
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:39,620
I want Balboa. I want Balboa.

63
00:06:39,754 --> 00:06:44,665
You hear that, old man? You tell Balboa.
Nobody can beat me. Tell him what I said.

64
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,885
And he's next. I'm gonna kill him.
Nobody can stop me.

65
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:51,179
You tell Balboa that. I'm comin' after him.

66
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:56,101
<i>I want a shot at the title if Balboa's</i>
<i>got the guts to meet me in the ring.</i>

67
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:59,395
<i>My whole life's been directed</i>
<i>towards this title.</i>

68
00:06:59,524 --> 00:07:03,652
<i>I live alone. I train alone.</i>
<i>I'll win the title alone. I want him.</i>

69
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:07,859
<i>He can't duck me forever.</i>
<i>He can run, but he can't hide.</i>

70
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,660
<i>Another southpaw,</i>
<i>champion Rocky Balboa,</i>

71
00:07:10,868 --> 00:07:13,110
<i>isn't worried about much these days.</i>

72
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:15,653
<i>He's defended his title for the tenth time</i>

73
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,333
<i>and will face the world heavyweight</i>
<i>wrestling champion in a charity benefit,</i>

74
00:07:20,461 --> 00:07:23,498
<i>with all the proceeds</i>
<i>to go to a local youth foundation.</i>

75
00:07:23,631 --> 00:07:28,293
<i>I'll have to give him credit. Mr Balboa</i>
<i>stays busy. He's a true sportsman.</i>

76
00:07:28,427 --> 00:07:33,136
<i>It looks like the no. 1 contender, Clubber</i>
<i>Lang, will have to play the waiting game.</i>

77
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:35,673
<i>But that should be a great match-up.</i>

78
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:38,217
Paulie, take it easy, OK?

79
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:43,099
Hey, you goin'?

80
00:07:43,234 --> 00:07:46,235
Hey,
don't forget to give Rocky my best, huh?

81
00:07:46,988 --> 00:07:49,989
You know, I've been comin' here years.

82
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:54,363
How 'bout you give me,
Paulie, your best once?

83
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:57,831
Take it easy, Paulie.

84
00:07:57,957 --> 00:08:01,658
Hey, Paulie, you heard me?

85
00:08:01,794 --> 00:08:05,543
When you see the Rock,
tell him the boys all said "Hey"!

86
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:54,361
Paulie.

87
00:09:58,327 --> 00:10:01,281
You wanna hear I owe ya?
You, I owe nothin'.

88
00:10:01,414 --> 00:10:03,656
Nah, you don't owe me nothin'.

89
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:06,080
So, what do ya want I should do?

90
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,045
- My sister ain't here?
- She's home.

91
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:12,375
Me and her were tight until you come in.

92
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:14,916
I raised her. She don't come down.

93
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:17,425
She don't know about this.

94
00:10:17,555 --> 00:10:19,797
You and her can go to hell,
you know that?

95
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:21,972
Watch your mouth, Paulie.

96
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:26,015
You gonna whack me?
I don't sweat you. Come on.

97
00:10:26,147 --> 00:10:28,270
Come on, Paul. Screw your head on right.

98
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,266
Nah, your freakin' head
is the one on wrong.

99
00:10:32,403 --> 00:10:36,567
- Yeah? What did I do?
- What'd ya do? Nothin'.

100
00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:41,741
For yourself? Oh, nice! You fixed
your face up handsome. Nice clothes.

101
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:45,536
What'd ya do for Paulie?
Three years - did ya get me a job?

102
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:50,459
Look at this! You gave me
a lousy stinkin' Ex-Lax watch. This!

103
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:54,750
- Paulie...
- What? What?

104
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:57,126
That's right. No, leave it down!

105
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:59,835
It never kept good time anyway.

106
00:11:00,681 --> 00:11:04,513
You forget when you were a punk
and those guys used to laugh at you.

107
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:08,344
- Who used to whack them bums out?
- They laughed at both of us.

108
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:10,888
No-one laughed at me.

109
00:11:11,025 --> 00:11:15,105
Tell me. Who fixed you up
with your first woman? Me, Paulie!

110
00:11:15,238 --> 00:11:20,612
- She was pregnant.
- So what? You was no prize either.

111
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:23,151
You know, I always give ya. I give ya.

112
00:11:23,287 --> 00:11:27,071
What do you do?
You buy a new house. You move Mick in.

113
00:11:27,208 --> 00:11:31,122
Did you ask me?
Is there somethin' the matter with me?

114
00:11:31,796 --> 00:11:34,548
I got feelings. This ain't cardboard.

115
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:36,713
Everybody's got 'em, Paulie.

116
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,842
- The hell with everybody.
- Maybe it's the hell with you.

117
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:46,302
- I don't wanna listen to this crap.
- You talk like everyone owes you a living.

118
00:11:46,435 --> 00:11:49,686
Nobody owes nobody nothin'.
You owe yourself.

119
00:11:49,814 --> 00:11:54,690
- You're wrong! Friends owe.
- No! Friends do because they wanna do.

120
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:57,392
Shut your freakin' mouth.
You keep me down.

121
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:02,904
Down? You're like a crazy brother
to me. You really are.

122
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:07,282
So I wanna tell you somethin'.
This is comin' straight from the heart.

123
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,159
You ain't down. And you ain't a loser.

124
00:12:11,669 --> 00:12:15,085
You're just a jealous, lazy bum.

125
00:12:16,424 --> 00:12:19,175
OK. I'm gonna break your mouth.

126
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:21,710
I'm gonna bust your mouth up!

127
00:12:32,815 --> 00:12:35,520
Can I have a job?

128
00:12:37,653 --> 00:12:40,323
All you had to do was ask.

129
00:12:45,203 --> 00:12:47,741
- You punch pretty good.
- Think so?

130
00:12:47,872 --> 00:12:49,911
Oh, superb!

131
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:54,835
- It cost a lot, huh?
- Yeah, a few bucks.

132
00:12:54,962 --> 00:12:57,251
Got an extra one?

133
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:03,887
- Any trouble with Paulie tonight?
- Nah, nothin' unusual.

134
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:06,586
Are you really gonna fight that wrestler?

135
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:09,595
That's all right. It'll be fun.

136
00:13:09,727 --> 00:13:12,183
Mind if I serenade you awhile?

137
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:14,934
<i>~ Doo doo doo-doo... ~</i>
Come on, it's your part.

138
00:13:15,066 --> 00:13:17,473
- What are you doing?
- Come on, you can do it.

139
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,567
<i>~ Doo doo doo-doo ~</i>

140
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:23,527
- Come on. You're gonna wake the baby.
- Adrian, let's do a duet.

141
00:13:23,658 --> 00:13:25,781
<i>~ Doo doo doo-doo</i>

142
00:13:26,577 --> 00:13:28,819
<i>~ Doe doe doe-doe... ~</i>
- No, no.

143
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:33,249
That's good, but it's not "doe doe".
It's <i>~ doo doo doo-doo ~</i>

144
00:13:34,085 --> 00:13:36,920
<i>~ Doo doo doe-doo... ~</i>
- That's good, darlin'.

145
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:41,922
<i>~ I been told</i>
<i>Doo doo doo-doo... ~</i>

146
00:13:42,051 --> 00:13:46,796
<i>~ By people, and they all</i>
<i>Doo doo doo-doo... ~</i>

147
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:51,593
<i>~ They said to take you back
Take you back like before ~</i>

148
00:13:55,106 --> 00:13:56,766
What's the matter?

149
00:13:56,899 --> 00:14:00,351
I don't know any more
of the composition.

150
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:04,151
- Maybe we're lucky.
- Yeah, maybe we're very lucky.

151
00:14:05,658 --> 00:14:09,572
<i>~ Doo doo doo-doo...</i>
<i>Hm hm mm-mm ~</i>

152
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:16,536
<i>Howdy, sports fans. This is Dennis James</i>
<i>with Jim Healy down here at ringside.</i>

153
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:20,667
Tonight we have a most unlikely match,
the boxer against the wrestler,

154
00:14:20,798 --> 00:14:23,254
with all the proceeds going to charity.

155
00:14:23,551 --> 00:14:26,256
What do you think about
a boxer against a wrestler?

156
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:31,726
You know the theory. Once the wrestler
grabs the boxer, that's all she wrote.

157
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:35,801
What the hell goes on inside your head?
Anything normal functions?

158
00:14:35,938 --> 00:14:38,346
- Yeah, there's a few.
- I don't think so.

159
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:42,694
To fight a creature like this,
you gotta have 100lb of brain damage.

160
00:14:42,862 --> 00:14:47,239
I seen wrestlers that was bigger than
dinosaurs. You ever fight a dinosaur?

161
00:14:47,366 --> 00:14:51,660
- No, not lately.
- They can cause a variety of damage.

162
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:54,659
The wrestling champion
of the world is here,

163
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,076
and he is quite a sight,
all decked out in red.

164
00:14:58,628 --> 00:15:01,794
- Why are they carryin' him?
- He's walkin'.

165
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,924
I'm comin' after you, Balboa.

166
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:13,678
- Let's call it off.
- Aw, come on. It's for charity.

167
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:18,222
You're wearin' your anatomy out.
Nobody else does this much for charity.

168
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:21,310
- Bob Hope would.
- That's true.

169
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:29,564
Rocky, you better call Bob Hope.

170
00:15:37,124 --> 00:15:40,458
To all my love slaves out there,

171
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:44,251
Thunderlips is here in the flesh, baby.

172
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,590
Oh, my God.

173
00:15:46,717 --> 00:15:51,759
The Ultimate Male,
versus the ultimate meatball.

174
00:15:53,182 --> 00:15:56,100
Boy, he is a monster!
How much would you take

175
00:15:56,227 --> 00:15:59,975
- even to get in the ring with him?
- Would you like to start at Fort Knox?

176
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:03,973
In the white corner, an incredible sight.

177
00:16:04,735 --> 00:16:07,606
Standing nearly seven feet,

178
00:16:08,322 --> 00:16:11,193
weighing 390lb...

179
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:15,411
- Large, ain't he?
...the undisputed wrestling champion...

180
00:16:15,538 --> 00:16:18,325
That's the biggest arm in the world!

181
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:23,544
A man who calls himself
the ultimate object of desire,

182
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,168
the mountain of molten lust,

183
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,000
the one, the only - Thunderlips!

184
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:40,767
You're all trash! You're all trash!
You're all trash!

185
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:47,228
The slugger from Philadelphia...

186
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,938
You better shut up.

187
00:16:51,782 --> 00:16:53,989
I'll break him in half!

188
00:16:54,118 --> 00:16:58,068
- How much do you think he eats?
- About 202lb.

189
00:16:58,206 --> 00:17:00,364
Weighing 202lb,

190
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:06,249
the reigning heavyweight champion
of the world, Rocky Balboa.

191
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:17,088
- Come to the centre of the ring.
- OK, come on, Mick.

192
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:29,691
All right, you guys. This is for fun,
so take it easy and give 'em a good show.

193
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,148
Listen, after the match, how about
we get a Polaroid together, OK?

194
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:38,282
You're in trouble, buster.

195
00:17:39,497 --> 00:17:42,498
He got me mad!
I'm gonna break him in half like this!

196
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:46,165
Lately, everybody wants to beat me up.

197
00:17:46,295 --> 00:17:48,667
This is entertainment. Fun and games.

198
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,297
Stay awake, make faces.
Move around the ring.

199
00:17:52,426 --> 00:17:54,799
He is the ring.

200
00:17:56,055 --> 00:17:58,463
I get nervous every time he does that.

201
00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:07,145
Whoa! You move fast for a big guy.

202
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:10,608
Why don't we just move around?
Give 'em a good show first.

203
00:18:10,736 --> 00:18:13,821
I'll chase you, and you chase me.
How's that? All right?

204
00:18:13,948 --> 00:18:17,115
I'll go easy. Here you go. Is that OK?

205
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:19,401
Does that hurt? All right?

206
00:18:19,537 --> 00:18:21,743
How's that? OK? Not bad, huh?

207
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,790
Come on, meatball.

208
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,581
Think it's all fake, meatball?

209
00:18:33,718 --> 00:18:36,635
Thunderlips has gone absolutely berserk.

210
00:18:38,347 --> 00:18:42,392
- Run for your life.
- Life's tough, meatball!

211
00:18:49,692 --> 00:18:54,437
Get up, boy. Come on, meatball.
Get some of this right here.

212
00:18:58,868 --> 00:19:02,071
Rocko, remember the neighbourhood!

213
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:04,246
Get out of his way!

214
00:19:04,373 --> 00:19:08,371
No, no. I'm not yet - not for the meatball.
I'm not throwing in yet, boy!

215
00:19:08,503 --> 00:19:13,663
If I can't break your spirit,
I sure enough can break your back.

216
00:19:15,134 --> 00:19:18,088
- Is Daddy having fun?
- Of course.

217
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:26,596
Somebody get me a hatchet.

218
00:19:27,063 --> 00:19:32,021
- Holy smoke.
- Here we go, baby! Nice drop, meatball.

219
00:19:36,405 --> 00:19:39,110
Oh, my God. Balboa is really in pain.

220
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:44,995
No one can believe the superhuman
strength of Thunderlips. I am the man!

221
00:19:45,122 --> 00:19:48,408
- Stop him, will ya?
- You want this punching bag?

222
00:19:48,543 --> 00:19:51,460
- Adrian!
- Rocky!

223
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:53,496
Catch me!

224
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:58,542
<i>Incredible! Balboa was just</i>
<i>heaved into the fifth row!</i>

225
00:19:58,678 --> 00:20:01,928
<i>Now the fans are outraged too!</i>

226
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:05,722
He's got me mad! I'm gonna
drag him down like a dirty rag!

227
00:20:05,852 --> 00:20:08,603
You weakling, Balboa.

228
00:20:09,272 --> 00:20:12,059
Take it easy, take it easy.

229
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:14,815
- Mickey, you OK?
- It's my heart.

230
00:20:14,944 --> 00:20:18,479
The security guards are rushing in,
trying to stop this slaughter.

231
00:20:18,614 --> 00:20:21,864
- Teeth are flying all around.
- Cut my gloves off.

232
00:20:23,578 --> 00:20:26,282
Cut my gloves off!

233
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:30,498
The place is a zoo.
This place has turned into a zoo!

234
00:20:32,128 --> 00:20:34,583
You want me to get a doctor?
You're sure?

235
00:20:34,714 --> 00:20:39,126
The girls have gotten into it now.
They're getting beat up.

236
00:20:41,846 --> 00:20:44,847
- I'll be right back.
- You're a maniac! Come back here!

237
00:20:44,974 --> 00:20:48,058
- What are you doing?
- Come back here!

238
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:52,931
- Come on!
- Out of the way, worms! I'm comin' up.

239
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:57,686
Come on, come on!

240
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:04,989
All right, Thunderlips. Break it up!

241
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:07,741
No choking. No choking.

242
00:21:09,207 --> 00:21:11,448
Paulie, don't!

243
00:21:14,962 --> 00:21:17,002
I don't sweat you.

244
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:27,261
Hang on there, kid.

245
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:29,975
How d'you like it?

246
00:21:32,313 --> 00:21:34,685
I don't need this.

247
00:21:36,108 --> 00:21:41,483
Rocky hanging on like a bull terrier.
Now he's going for the stranglehold.

248
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:44,022
Rocky! Rocky!

249
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:51,912
The body!

250
00:21:56,212 --> 00:21:58,881
Knock his block off!

251
00:22:07,098 --> 00:22:09,137
No-o-o-o!

252
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,763
It's unbelievable! Rocky actually did it!

253
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:17,680
The human skyscraper is out of the ring!

254
00:22:17,817 --> 00:22:20,486
Right. That's it! Time is up.

255
00:22:23,865 --> 00:22:27,779
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a draw.

256
00:22:29,537 --> 00:22:32,372
Thank you for attending
the annual charity match

257
00:22:32,498 --> 00:22:35,285
between the Italian Stallion,
Rocky Balboa,

258
00:22:35,418 --> 00:22:37,790
and Thunderlips, the Ultimate Male.

259
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,246
See you next year. Thank God.

260
00:22:40,381 --> 00:22:42,504
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, pretty good.

261
00:22:42,884 --> 00:22:44,592
Good match.

262
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:48,467
- Why'd you get so crazy on me out there?
- That's the name of the game.

263
00:22:48,598 --> 00:22:52,298
While you're still calm,
can we get that Polaroid together?

264
00:22:52,435 --> 00:22:55,436
- Yeah, sure.
- Adrian, come on over here.

265
00:22:55,563 --> 00:23:00,059
- My wife Adrian, my kid... Thunderlips.
- Ow! That hurt!

266
00:23:00,193 --> 00:23:02,315
That's all right.

267
00:23:02,445 --> 00:23:06,063
You know, sometimes charity really hurts.

268
00:23:09,577 --> 00:23:13,824
And Pinocchio told a lie, you see,
and his nose started growing real big.

269
00:23:13,956 --> 00:23:18,832
- Why didn't his ears grow?
- I don't know. I didn't write the story.

270
00:23:18,961 --> 00:23:22,876
- Are you fighting again?
- No, I don't plan on fighting today.

271
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:26,043
- Promise?
- Promise. Definitely. I promise.

272
00:23:26,177 --> 00:23:29,012
- Good, I like you here.
- Yeah? I like being here.

273
00:23:29,138 --> 00:23:31,973
Are you gettin' hungry?
You want some breakfast?

274
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:35,136
- Some Wheaties? What are Wheaties?
- Champions.

275
00:23:35,269 --> 00:23:38,354
Breakfast of what? Champions!

276
00:23:38,481 --> 00:23:41,731
<i>The father bear says</i>
<i>"Somebody's been sleepin' in my bed."</i>

277
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:46,854
The little bear said "Somebody's been
sleepin' in my bed, and there she is."

278
00:23:46,989 --> 00:23:52,778
He pulls back the covers, exposing her
to the, you know, public. See?

279
00:23:52,912 --> 00:23:54,951
Eat your cereal before it sinks.

280
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:58,865
- What happened to Goldilocks?
- I'm not exactly sure.

281
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:03,213
- Busted for trespassing and got 30 days.
- That's real nice, Paulie.

282
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:08,003
Rocky. Rocky, the car is waiting.

283
00:24:08,135 --> 00:24:11,089
- Go ahead. You guys better go.
- Be a good boy now.

284
00:24:11,222 --> 00:24:13,927
We'll have a fun time, me and the kid.

285
00:24:14,058 --> 00:24:16,976
Mrs Stallion, you almost look pretty good.

286
00:24:17,103 --> 00:24:19,345
Oh. Thank you, Paulie.

287
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,641
Don't give the kid any beer.
And, Paulie, don't take him to the track.

288
00:24:24,777 --> 00:24:27,564
- How you doin', Mick?
- Pretty good.

289
00:24:29,073 --> 00:24:31,778
Now we got a problem in the seventh.

290
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,426
Whatever happened to them
quiet, tender moments?

291
00:25:12,992 --> 00:25:15,032
Thank you. Thank you, one and all.

292
00:25:15,953 --> 00:25:20,200
Every once in a while, a person
comes along who defies the odds,

293
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:26,420
who defies logic
and fulfils an incredible dream.

294
00:25:26,672 --> 00:25:29,876
On behalf of all
the citizens of Philadelphia

295
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:32,761
and those touched
by your accomplishments

296
00:25:33,137 --> 00:25:37,929
and your untiring participation
in this city's many charity functions,

297
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:41,559
it is with great honour
that we present this memorial,

298
00:25:41,938 --> 00:25:47,976
which will stand always as a celebration
to the indomitable spirit of man.

299
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:51,942
Philadelphia salutes
its favourite son, Rocky Balboa!

300
00:26:04,377 --> 00:26:08,421
- It's beautiful.
- Definitely a thing of beauty.

301
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:11,336
Rocky! Rocky!

302
00:26:23,729 --> 00:26:25,769
Thank you.

303
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,400
Thank you very much.

304
00:26:35,992 --> 00:26:40,286
I don't know, what... what do you say
to something like this?

305
00:26:42,206 --> 00:26:45,160
About three years ago,

306
00:26:45,293 --> 00:26:50,453
this city really took me inside, you know?

307
00:26:53,426 --> 00:26:58,254
And I wanna thank you very much
for that. I really do.

308
00:26:59,056 --> 00:27:04,477
And I been thinking... I wasn't gonna
bring this up, but I might as well now.

309
00:27:05,062 --> 00:27:09,190
I would never do anything
to hurt this sport

310
00:27:09,317 --> 00:27:13,729
that has been so really good to me.

311
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:18,906
I been talkin' it over
with my wife and my manager.

312
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:22,742
We think that...

313
00:27:22,872 --> 00:27:27,083
It's really hard to do this. I feel like...

314
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,994
I'm thinkin' maybe it's time that I should

315
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:36,041
step down maybe and retire.

316
00:27:41,682 --> 00:27:45,762
Gettin' out while you can? Don't give
this sucker no statue. Give him guts!

317
00:27:45,895 --> 00:27:49,430
I told you I wasn't goin' away.
You got your shot. Now gimme mine.

318
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:52,981
- Why don't you get the hell outta there?
- Shut up, old man!

319
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,352
Tell these folks why you've ducked me.

320
00:27:55,488 --> 00:27:58,358
Politics, man!
This country wants to keep me down.

321
00:27:58,491 --> 00:28:03,034
They don't want a man like me to have
the title because I'm not a puppet like you.

322
00:28:03,162 --> 00:28:08,323
- You know, you've got a big mouth.
- Why don't you close it, Balboa?

323
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:11,662
- Any time.
- The guy's crazy. Don't listen to him.

324
00:28:11,796 --> 00:28:15,247
The little man don't wanna come to me,
so I'll lay out the truth.

325
00:28:15,383 --> 00:28:18,384
I am ranked number one. One!
That means I'm the best.

326
00:28:18,511 --> 00:28:21,512
But this bum takes the easy matches,
fights other bums.

327
00:28:21,639 --> 00:28:26,680
I'm tellin' you and everybody here. I'll
fight him anywhere, any time, for nothin'.

328
00:28:29,605 --> 00:28:32,772
But you people ain't gonna see that,
cos he's gonna retire.

329
00:28:32,984 --> 00:28:36,435
You see, he don't fight no real man.
He fight them set-ups.

330
00:28:36,571 --> 00:28:39,026
- What?
- You're a disgrace to this sport.

331
00:28:39,157 --> 00:28:41,992
Shut up, old man!
You don't know where I came from.

332
00:28:42,118 --> 00:28:46,198
Balboa, your family doin' real nice.
You call yourself a fighter, prove it.

333
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:50,079
Give me the same chance.
The way you been duckin' is a disgrace.

334
00:28:50,418 --> 00:28:52,825
If he ain't no coward,
why don't he fight me?

335
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:56,331
- I can't listen to this...
- I don't care what you're ranked.

336
00:28:56,465 --> 00:29:01,626
- You don't get no shot, and I mean that!
- What are you doin'? I wanna fight him.

337
00:29:01,762 --> 00:29:04,929
Well, you got him.
But you fight him without me.

338
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:09,978
- What are you sayin'?
- It's finished. I don't want no more of this.

339
00:29:10,104 --> 00:29:13,555
I don't want no more of it.
You understand? None of it!

340
00:29:13,858 --> 00:29:16,610
It's over with!

341
00:29:16,736 --> 00:29:19,856
Hey, woman! Hey, woman. Listen here.

342
00:29:19,989 --> 00:29:23,572
Since your old man ain't got no heart,
maybe you wanna see a real man?

343
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:26,951
I bet you stay up every night
dreaming you had a real man, huh?

344
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:32,370
Bring your pretty little self over to my
apartment and I'll show you a real man.

345
00:29:32,502 --> 00:29:34,790
You want it, you got it! You got it, man!

346
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:41,500
I'll see you in the ring! You got it!

347
00:29:48,142 --> 00:29:51,558
Rocky, don't! Come on.
Rocky, please. Let's go talk.

348
00:29:51,687 --> 00:29:53,846
OK, Adrian.

349
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:56,437
Rocky! Let's talk.

350
00:30:01,322 --> 00:30:03,860
Why'd you leave?
Why'd you walk away like that?

351
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:06,696
Life's too short, kid.

352
00:30:06,828 --> 00:30:11,620
- Where you goin'?
- I'm goin' on a permanent vacation.

353
00:30:12,083 --> 00:30:14,538
What do you mean?
We got one more fight.

354
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:17,753
No, no. Not "we". You.

355
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:20,788
Why are you doin' this?

356
00:30:24,971 --> 00:30:28,671
- I said, why you doin' this?
- Because you can't win, Rock.

357
00:30:28,808 --> 00:30:31,928
This guy'll kill you to death
inside of three rounds.

358
00:30:32,061 --> 00:30:34,386
- You're crazy.
- What else is new?

359
00:30:34,522 --> 00:30:37,725
- He's just another fighter.
- No, he ain't.

360
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:40,147
This guy is a wreckin' machine.

361
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:44,275
And he's hungry. You ain't been
hungry since you won that belt.

362
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:47,491
- What? I had ten title defences.
- That was easy.

363
00:30:47,618 --> 00:30:51,402
- What do you mean, easy?
- They was hand-picked!

364
00:30:53,875 --> 00:30:56,544
- Set-ups?
- No, they weren't set-ups!

365
00:30:56,669 --> 00:31:00,453
They was good fighters.
But they wasn't killers, like this guy.

366
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,460
He'll knock ya into tomorrow, Rock.

367
00:31:22,862 --> 00:31:25,151
Jeez, Mick.

368
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:28,864
Why'd you do it?

369
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:36,659
Because the beating that you got from
Apollo shoulda killed you, kid. It didn't.

370
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:41,953
It was my job to keep you winning,
and to keep you healthy.

371
00:31:47,094 --> 00:31:50,261
You really don't think
I got nothin' left, do you?

372
00:31:51,098 --> 00:31:54,966
Well, Rock, let's... let's put it this way.

373
00:31:56,312 --> 00:31:59,562
Now, three years ago,
you was supernatural.

374
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:04,694
You was...
You was hard, and you was nasty

375
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,276
and you had this cast-iron jaw.

376
00:32:08,032 --> 00:32:14,236
But then, the worst thing happened to you
that could happen to any fighter.

377
00:32:15,623 --> 00:32:17,948
You got civilised.

378
00:32:23,422 --> 00:32:25,415
But don't worry, kid.

379
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:32,133
You know, presidents retire,
generals retire, horses retire.

380
00:32:32,265 --> 00:32:36,345
Man o' War retired.
They put him out to stud.

381
00:32:37,687 --> 00:32:40,688
That's what you shoulda done - retire.

382
00:32:44,277 --> 00:32:47,194
I can't retire knowin' all this, Mick.

383
00:32:47,321 --> 00:32:50,239
- Aw, don't push it.
- You been carrying me.

384
00:32:50,366 --> 00:32:53,984
- We don't need it.
- You been carrying me, though.

385
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,370
I haven't been carryin' you,
I've been protectin' ya.

386
00:32:57,498 --> 00:33:00,618
No, I want this fight. Just one more.

387
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:03,955
- No, we don't need it.
- I'll live in the gym.

388
00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:06,579
- We don't need it.
- Mick, I do.

389
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:12,214
- I'm askin' you to train me one last time.
- No, no. I can't.

390
00:33:12,346 --> 00:33:14,588
If you don't,

391
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:19,966
I'm gonna tell everybody you ain't
bought new underwear in ten years.

392
00:33:20,104 --> 00:33:23,888
- You would, wouldn't ya?
- Yeah. Absolutely.

393
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:28,062
No, no.

394
00:33:28,196 --> 00:33:30,235
Come on.

395
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:35,410
One more time - it's over. It's a deal?

396
00:33:35,536 --> 00:33:39,368
- Go on, go on.
- It's your head, kid. It's your head.

397
00:33:42,543 --> 00:33:45,580
Yeah, it is. Thanks, man.

398
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:50,671
<i>~ Pushin', gettin' ready for the fight ~</i>

399
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:54,427
<i>~ Pushin', every day and night ~</i>

400
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:59,638

00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:02,770

00:34:03,356 --> 00:34:05,847
<i>~ Pushin', gettin' ready for the fight... ~</i>

403
00:34:05,983 --> 00:34:08,937
Rocky robes here!
Get your Rocky robes here!

404
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:13,317
Rocky robes, hot off the truck!
Clean stuff. Get your robes!

405
00:34:20,873 --> 00:34:23,543
<i>~ On the night of the fight ~</i>

406
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:25,411

00:34:29,215 --> 00:34:31,421

00:34:31,551 --> 00:34:33,045

<i>~ There's nowhere to run,</i>

411
00:34:37,223 --> 00:34:40,307
Collectors' item! Get your buttons here!

412
00:34:40,977 --> 00:34:45,971
You can't stand toe to toe with
this guy or he'll deposit you up on Mars.

413
00:34:46,107 --> 00:34:48,942
He's too tough. He's too strong.

414
00:34:50,236 --> 00:34:54,649
Listen, how the hell can we
train in this creep joint here?

415
00:34:54,782 --> 00:34:57,949
This is kind of a house of ill repute,
or somethin', is it?

416
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:02,490
- Why did you rent this joint?
- Aw, come on. Let's go out in style.

417
00:35:02,748 --> 00:35:05,239
You wanna go out in style,
go out in one piece.

418
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:08,496
Now, come on, let's get outta here,
back to the old gym.

419
00:35:08,629 --> 00:35:11,381
Let's get some blood
and sweat and tears around here.

420
00:35:11,507 --> 00:35:15,635
- Can we do that?
- Hey, will you just relax and enjoy it, OK?

421
00:35:19,807 --> 00:35:21,634
They love it, Mick.

422
00:35:28,941 --> 00:35:32,275
Go on, fight.
Fight now, go ahead. Fight it, fight it.

423
00:35:32,403 --> 00:35:35,689
Get rough. Get tough. Get brutal. That's it.

424
00:35:35,823 --> 00:35:38,030
Excuse me. Can I get a kiss?

425
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:41,029
- Yeah, sure.
- Get outta here, will ya?

426
00:35:41,162 --> 00:35:44,613
This is like fightin' in a zoo.

427
00:35:44,749 --> 00:35:50,538
Is that the way you train for Clubber?
He ain't gonna kiss ya. He's gonna kill ya.

428
00:35:50,671 --> 00:35:52,711
Get outta here!

429
00:35:56,636 --> 00:36:00,550
- Hey, Rock. How about a picture?
- Yeah, sure.

430
00:36:56,153 --> 00:36:59,854
This'll tell us a story.
That's it, side to side.

431
00:36:59,991 --> 00:37:02,030
Side to side, Rock.

432
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,362
Shut up back there, can't you?
Change your tune.

433
00:37:06,497 --> 00:37:10,709
That's it. Pull front punches. That's it, kid.
You're a deadly weapon.

434
00:37:10,835 --> 00:37:14,334
Time! Time, time, time. Quit it.

435
00:37:14,463 --> 00:37:16,503
You're OK. Come on.

436
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:21,630
Put this on before you catch pneumonia.
I'll give you a rubdown too.

437
00:37:21,762 --> 00:37:27,349
Listen, I don't like to hear much
of what comes out of people's mouths,

438
00:37:27,476 --> 00:37:30,050
and I don't like soft-talkin' moments.

439
00:37:30,188 --> 00:37:33,603
- That's for sure.
- But I just wanna tell ya one thing.

440
00:37:33,733 --> 00:37:37,777
- That I'm proud of ya.
- Well, thanks a lot.

441
00:37:37,904 --> 00:37:40,477
That's all right, kid. Let's get outta here.

442
00:37:40,615 --> 00:37:44,149
Hey, Mick. What do you think
we're gonna do when it's all over?

443
00:37:44,285 --> 00:37:46,693
I don't know. Maybe join up with a circus.

444
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:48,869
Yeah, maybe.

445
00:37:48,998 --> 00:37:51,323
All right, let's get out.

446
00:37:57,173 --> 00:37:59,746
Good evening.
With Bill Baldwin, I'm Stu Nahan.

447
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:04,842
Welcome to this heavyweight title fight,
which may be the most memorable of all.

448
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:09,100
Tonight is the champion's final
and perhaps most difficult defence.

449
00:38:09,227 --> 00:38:13,011
- Rocky, are you in your best shape?
- Absolutely. I feel real good.

450
00:38:13,272 --> 00:38:16,522
He's a deadly weapon.
He's one of a kind and he's gonna do it.

451
00:38:16,651 --> 00:38:20,898
- Clubber, are you as fast as Balboa?
- No talkin'. I do my talkin' in the ring.

452
00:38:23,449 --> 00:38:26,367
I told you, you better get outta here.
I wanna be alone.

453
00:38:26,494 --> 00:38:30,657
- Will you retire after this fight?
- Yeah. This is the last one for sure.

454
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:33,079
This is definitely the last one.

455
00:38:33,793 --> 00:38:36,248
You're parasites and leeches.
Get outta here.

456
00:38:36,379 --> 00:38:39,249
What will you do after tonight?

457
00:38:39,382 --> 00:38:41,421
I'm not sure.

458
00:38:41,551 --> 00:38:45,383
- Maybe join the circus. Huh, Mick?
- Yeah, have some fun.

459
00:38:45,513 --> 00:38:49,380
- Come on, take your robe off.
- Take off your robe!

460
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:51,842
I told you to get outta my face!

461
00:38:51,978 --> 00:38:56,189
With us is the former heavyweight
champion of the world, Apollo Creed.

462
00:38:56,315 --> 00:38:59,980
Do you have any predictions on this fight?
How do you see it going?

463
00:39:00,111 --> 00:39:02,780
Strength would have
to go to the challenger,

464
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:07,733
while experience and the world's
hardest head would have to go to Balboa.

465
00:39:08,161 --> 00:39:12,869
Remember, Rock, don't trade with this
guy. Take your time. Wear him down.

466
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:18,539
But don't stand toe to toe.
This punk's never been 15 rounds before.

467
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:21,755
- Take him good.
- OK. I will.

468
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:28,884
- I predict the champ's gonna take it.
- Do you really think he can hit that hard?

469
00:39:29,015 --> 00:39:31,684
Why do you think I'm here with you?

470
00:39:49,076 --> 00:39:53,785
Hey, sucker! You're finished!
You're through! You're washed up!

471
00:39:53,915 --> 00:39:56,156
- I'm the baddest in the world!
- Not to me.

472
00:39:56,542 --> 00:39:59,828
What you say, paper champion?
I'm gonna beat you like a dog.

473
00:39:59,962 --> 00:40:02,085
Get that ape back in the ring.

474
00:40:02,215 --> 00:40:06,212
- You made me wait too long! You'll pay!
- Come on, mouth.

475
00:40:06,552 --> 00:40:09,008
Get him outta there!

476
00:40:18,147 --> 00:40:21,314
Do you know who I am? I'm the man!

477
00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:28,443
- I'll get you, sucker! You're dead meat!
- Let me go!

478
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:32,109
Rocky! Rocky!

479
00:40:32,954 --> 00:40:35,658
- What's wrong?
- It's his heart.

480
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:39,325
Get a doctor!
Somebody get a doctor! Come on!

481
00:40:46,342 --> 00:40:48,915
Get 'em outta here!

482
00:40:49,053 --> 00:40:51,805
- Mick, will you sit on the table?
- I'm all right.

483
00:40:51,931 --> 00:40:55,181
Take a deep breath.
Get those guys outta here! Move!

484
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:59,644
Paulie, tell 'em the fight's off.
Go on. Go on!

485
00:40:59,772 --> 00:41:03,058
The fight's not off.
Are you outta your mind? The fight's on.

486
00:41:03,192 --> 00:41:06,644
- Mick, we can't tonight. I ain't fightin'.
- We're gonna fight.

487
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:10,029
Just let me get my breath.
Is that against the rules?

488
00:41:10,783 --> 00:41:13,784
- Will you please get a doctor?
- He's on his way.

489
00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:16,865
Mick, I can't go out and fight like this.

490
00:41:16,998 --> 00:41:22,205
Get outta there. Get goin', will ya? Take
him. Take him good - get it over with.

491
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,878
Adrian, what am I supposed to do?

492
00:41:28,009 --> 00:41:33,299
What do ya mean? After all these years
together, you don't know what to do?

493
00:41:33,431 --> 00:41:37,131
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
Now get out there and do it.

494
00:41:38,394 --> 00:41:40,434
Do it.

495
00:41:41,189 --> 00:41:43,098
Do it.

496
00:41:43,232 --> 00:41:47,312
- You're the best.
- OK. OK.

497
00:41:47,445 --> 00:41:50,114
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

498
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:52,446
Oh, my God.

499
00:41:55,828 --> 00:41:58,995
Adrian, take care of him.
Take care of him.

500
00:42:03,961 --> 00:42:06,203
Ladies and gentlemen,

501
00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:11,546
welcome to the heavyweight
championship of the world.

502
00:42:11,677 --> 00:42:16,256
And fans, with us tonight,
truly one of the fistic greats.

503
00:42:16,432 --> 00:42:22,221
He's coming up from ringside,
the Master of Disaster, the King of Sting,

504
00:42:22,355 --> 00:42:25,521
the one and only Apollo Creed.

505
00:42:26,984 --> 00:42:30,400
There's the former heavyweight
champion, Apollo Creed.

506
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,818
He looks like $9 million.

507
00:42:33,282 --> 00:42:38,656
Get outta my face! I don't need
no has-been messin' in my corner.

508
00:42:38,788 --> 00:42:41,623
Get that bad look off your face
before I knock it off!

509
00:42:41,749 --> 00:42:46,162
Come on. Wanna jump me? Jump!
Come on. Come on, Creed.

510
00:42:46,629 --> 00:42:49,915
Come on. Yeah, come on.

511
00:42:50,049 --> 00:42:53,584
Yeah. Just like a chicken. You better run.

512
00:42:57,056 --> 00:43:02,347
Give everybody a present and drop this
chump, all right? Good luck to you, man.

513
00:43:07,066 --> 00:43:11,562
All right, fans, here we go.
On my left, out of the blue corner,

514
00:43:11,696 --> 00:43:16,737
hailing from Chicago,
weighing in at an even 235lb,

515
00:43:17,034 --> 00:43:19,952
the world's No.1 challenger...

516
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,199
- Wonder how Mick's doin'.
...Clubber Lang.

517
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,036
I'm the best! I'm the best!

518
00:43:28,713 --> 00:43:31,464
You and Clubber exchanged words.
Any comment?

519
00:43:31,591 --> 00:43:32,705
No comment.

520
00:43:32,842 --> 00:43:39,011
His opponent in the opposite corner,
really needing no introduction,

521
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,840
he weighs in at a trim 201 lb.

522
00:43:42,977 --> 00:43:47,438
The pride of Philadelphia,
the Italian Stallion,

523
00:43:47,565 --> 00:43:54,612
and the reigning heavyweight champion
of the world, Rocky Balboa.

524
00:43:58,659 --> 00:44:00,866
Listen to this crowd.

525
00:44:06,459 --> 00:44:11,666
Now to give instructions in the middle
of the ring, your referee, Marty Denkin.

526
00:44:13,716 --> 00:44:16,670
Clubber, Rocky. I want a good, clean fight.

527
00:44:16,802 --> 00:44:19,673
When I tell you to break,
step back and break.

528
00:44:19,805 --> 00:44:23,803
Now go back to the corner
and come out fighting at the bell.

529
00:44:24,268 --> 00:44:27,269
Dead meat.

530
00:44:31,234 --> 00:44:33,772
This is not gonna be a fight of finesse.

531
00:44:33,903 --> 00:44:37,070
These are two guys
that really throw punches.

532
00:44:37,198 --> 00:44:40,234
- The chump is scared.
- Yeah. Tear him up, champ.

533
00:44:40,368 --> 00:44:42,906
He's scared. See the look in his eyes?

534
00:44:44,163 --> 00:44:48,078
I'm no trainer. Just go out
and kill the guy. Kill him, Rock.

535
00:44:49,168 --> 00:44:51,706
He's scared.

536
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:55,171
I'm the new champion!
I'm the new champ as of tonight.

537
00:44:55,299 --> 00:45:00,175
...Italian Stallion, a rugged champion,
in the final fight of his colourful career.

538
00:45:04,976 --> 00:45:08,594
Here we go. Oh boy,
the champion came out swinging.

539
00:45:10,356 --> 00:45:14,899
Balboa's off to an incredible start,
determined to destroy the challenger.

540
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:22,107
Move him back! Move him back!

541
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:28,328
Defence.

542
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:32,752
They're goin' at each other.

543
00:45:34,172 --> 00:45:36,460
You got him.

544
00:45:36,591 --> 00:45:38,963
Double up! Double up!

545
00:45:40,845 --> 00:45:44,712
Come on! Come on now, boy! Come on.

546
00:45:46,726 --> 00:45:49,976
The challenger is hitting him
with everything he's got.

547
00:45:54,483 --> 00:45:56,939
Come on, Balboa. Make me weak!

548
00:45:57,528 --> 00:46:00,066
Come on, Balboa. Come on, weakling.

549
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:09,822
Clubber away.
Trying to get him to his corner.

550
00:46:09,957 --> 00:46:12,033
Grab him, Paulie.

551
00:46:12,919 --> 00:46:15,291
- Where's Mick? Where's Mick?
- He's OK.

552
00:46:15,421 --> 00:46:17,165
I need him.

553
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:19,961
He ain't nothin'! I told you he ain't nothin'.

554
00:46:20,092 --> 00:46:23,711
- He's too strong.
- Don't talk like that, Rock.

555
00:46:23,846 --> 00:46:26,598
I'm gonna smoke him.
I'm gonna smoke him.

556
00:46:27,058 --> 00:46:29,300
I can't keep him off.

557
00:46:29,852 --> 00:46:32,343
He's mine! I'm gonna get him!

558
00:46:32,939 --> 00:46:35,015
I'm losin' it, Paulie.

559
00:46:37,151 --> 00:46:39,025
- What have you got?
- 200 over 50.

560
00:46:39,153 --> 00:46:41,312
All right, let's start CPR.

561
00:46:42,406 --> 00:46:44,897
- Rock, you can do it.
- I'll try.

562
00:46:45,034 --> 00:46:48,818
Round two.
Rocky appears to be staggering.

563
00:46:48,955 --> 00:46:53,284
- Yeah, I'll get him.
- Out of the corner, here comes Clubber!

564
00:46:56,295 --> 00:46:59,960
Come on, Balboa, come on. Give it to me.

565
00:47:04,011 --> 00:47:06,218
Move on the inside.

566
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:10,971
The champion is nearly helpless.
Gosh, what a beating he's taking.

567
00:47:16,566 --> 00:47:19,650
Don't stand toe to toe with him.

568
00:47:38,421 --> 00:47:42,465
- Man, get up.
- Get up! Get up!

569
00:47:42,592 --> 00:47:45,213
I told you I'm gonna get you.
Come on, get up!

570
00:47:45,344 --> 00:47:48,345
Seven, eight, nine,

571
00:47:48,681 --> 00:47:50,555
ten. You're out.

572
00:47:51,017 --> 00:47:53,804
The champion is finished
in the second round!

573
00:47:53,936 --> 00:47:57,139
It's unbelievable. Incredible upset.

574
00:47:57,273 --> 00:48:01,021
Balboa, in the corner,
is out on his feet, out of the fight.

575
00:48:06,157 --> 00:48:08,280
We have the time.

576
00:48:08,409 --> 00:48:13,652
The winner by knockout, the new
heavyweight champion of the world,

577
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:16,494
Clubber Lang!

578
00:48:16,626 --> 00:48:19,295
I told you! I told you I'd do it!

579
00:48:21,297 --> 00:48:24,500
I'm the new champion of the world!

580
00:48:31,891 --> 00:48:33,930
Come on, get outta here!

581
00:48:39,357 --> 00:48:41,812
- What happened?
- I'm all right. How's Mick?

582
00:48:41,943 --> 00:48:44,101
He wouldn't go to the hospital.

583
00:48:44,237 --> 00:48:47,771
Mr Balboa, we must get him
to hospital immediately.

584
00:48:47,907 --> 00:48:49,531
OK.

585
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,798
- Mick?
- What?

586
00:49:05,925 --> 00:49:11,844
- Mick?
- Wh... what? Wh-wh-what?

587
00:49:11,973 --> 00:49:16,267
- Is it over?
- Yeah. Yeah, it's all over.

588
00:49:17,395 --> 00:49:21,227
Hey, listen. What happened?

589
00:49:22,066 --> 00:49:24,438
It was a knockout.

590
00:49:25,528 --> 00:49:29,193
- What round? What round?
- Second round.

591
00:49:32,368 --> 00:49:35,155
Yeah, I knew it. That's good.

592
00:49:35,288 --> 00:49:38,870
- We did it, huh?
- We did it. We did it.

593
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,827
You don't have to worry about nothin'
no more. Everything's gonna be OK, Mick.

594
00:49:43,963 --> 00:49:48,210
- Yeah. Rocky, we did it.
- You gotta get to hospital.

595
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:51,133
You ain't as young as you used to be, OK?

596
00:49:51,262 --> 00:49:53,587
You know what?

597
00:49:53,723 --> 00:49:56,926
We did everything right.
I did everything right?

598
00:49:57,059 --> 00:49:59,218
Listen, you done everything right.

599
00:49:59,353 --> 00:50:04,430
Listen, we got more to do. Mick,
whatever you wanna do, we'll do it, OK?

600
00:50:05,067 --> 00:50:07,356
I love ya, kid. I love ya.

601
00:50:08,821 --> 00:50:10,861
Mick.

602
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:13,030
It hurts me.

603
00:50:15,077 --> 00:50:17,070
Mick?

604
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:22,748
Mick!

605
00:50:30,551 --> 00:50:32,591
Mick!

606
00:50:35,765 --> 00:50:38,516
Mick... Christ.

607
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,903
Don't go away. Please don't.

608
00:50:56,035 --> 00:51:01,456
We got more to do...
We got more to do. We got...

609
00:51:03,334 --> 00:51:08,541
Oh, God. Oh, Jesus.

610
00:52:07,106 --> 00:52:09,395
This concludes our service.

611
00:55:03,866 --> 00:55:06,238
That's not the way to do it.

612
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,361
Who's that?

613
00:55:09,038 --> 00:55:12,324
Why don't you hit it straight? Step into it.

614
00:55:14,335 --> 00:55:17,419
- Apollo?
- Right.

615
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:21,924
I waited at your house for an hour.
Your wife said you might be here.

616
00:55:22,051 --> 00:55:25,467
- What are you doin' here?
- Business.

617
00:55:27,056 --> 00:55:32,892
If the papers knew we were talkin' like
this, they'd think we was crazy. Why you?

618
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,187
Cos I'm the best and you need
somebody to teach you different.

619
00:55:36,315 --> 00:55:40,728
- Why?
- You can't pull it off without me.

620
00:55:40,862 --> 00:55:44,313
You still didn't give me the answer.
What's the real reason?

621
00:55:45,533 --> 00:55:47,988
Listen. It's quiet, isn't it?

622
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:51,783
When you retire, it's too quiet.

623
00:55:51,914 --> 00:55:54,037
We too young to retire, anyway.

624
00:55:54,167 --> 00:56:00,287
Besides, I could promote this thing into
the biggest gate ever. Bigger than ours.

625
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:05,133
Heaven knows, I don't mind being
involved with large numbers, right?

626
00:56:06,512 --> 00:56:10,592
I don't need this no more.
I... I don't want this no more.

627
00:56:11,893 --> 00:56:15,178
Look, man. When you beat me,

628
00:56:16,105 --> 00:56:20,814
I hurt all over. I didn't wanna know
from nobody, not even my kids.

629
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:23,650
Every fighter knows that hurt.

630
00:56:23,779 --> 00:56:27,030
We get sick inside trying to live with it,
so don't back off now.

631
00:56:27,158 --> 00:56:30,823
Make it right for yourself
or you'll be sorry you didn't.

632
00:56:30,953 --> 00:56:35,033
We held the greatest title
in the whole world, babe.

633
00:56:36,209 --> 00:56:40,621
You lost that fight for all
the wrong reasons. You lost your edge.

634
00:56:41,422 --> 00:56:46,582
All right. I know your manager dying
had you all messed up inside.

635
00:56:47,345 --> 00:56:50,299
But the truth is you didn't look hungry.

636
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,637
Now when we fought,

637
00:56:53,518 --> 00:56:56,435
you had that eye of the tiger,
man, the edge.

638
00:56:56,604 --> 00:57:01,811
Now you gotta get it back, and the way
to do it is to go back to the beginning.

639
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,995
Maybe we could win it back together.

640
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:10,505
Eye of the tiger, man.

641
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,803
Why'd you have to come here?

642
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:20,301
I have the plan. Get back, man.

643
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:24,312
You got me curious.

644
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,435
You got me curious, Rock.

645
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:36,906
<i>Clubber, do you accept the challenge</i>
<i>for a rematch with Balboa?</i>

646
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:40,370
<i>I reject the challenge</i>
<i>because Balboa is no challenge.</i>

647
00:57:40,499 --> 00:57:44,627
<i>But I'd be happy to beat up on him</i>
<i>some more. I always said he was nothin'.</i>

648
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:46,793
I can't wait to see this bum fall.

649
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:49,876
<i>What do you think of him</i>
<i>being trained by Apollo Creed?</i>

650
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:53,258
<i>Apollo who? That old fool Apollo Creed?</i>

651
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:56,969
<i>- Shucks. One has-been...</i>
- Just keep talkin', pal.

652
00:57:57,099 --> 00:58:00,598
<i>Been runnin' off at the mouth.</i>
<i>When I see him, I'm gonna close it.</i>

653
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:04,642
<i>- When will the match take place?</i>
<i>- The sooner, the better.</i>

654
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:09,684
<i>I'm the champion of the world.</i>
<i>I can't be beat and I won't be beat.</i>

655
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:13,355
<i>This time I'll train harder.</i>
<i>There won't be no quick knockdowns.</i>

656
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,906
<i>I'm gonna torture him.</i>
<i>I'm gonna crucify him - real bad.</i>

657
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,158
<i>Hard words from a hard man.</i>

658
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:24,958
<i>The odds against Balboa making</i>
<i>a comeback at 34 are very long indeed.</i>

659
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:28,335
<i>Can he do it? Most experts doubt it.</i>

660
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:33,754
<i>Balboa was a fine champion,</i>
<i>but his time has passed. I wish him luck.</i>

661
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,381
- Don't listen to it, Rocky.
- No, do listen to it, Rock.

662
00:58:39,508 --> 00:58:44,134
When this is over, a lot of folks are
gonna owe you an engraved apology.

663
00:58:45,472 --> 00:58:49,470
- And you're gonna owe me a big favour.
- What favour?

664
00:58:49,601 --> 00:58:51,890
When it's over. Hm?

665
00:58:56,817 --> 00:59:01,894
Rocko, come on! We're gonna
be late at the airport. Let's go!

666
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:05,565
- Think we forgot anything?
- I think we have it all.

667
00:59:05,701 --> 00:59:09,745
- Maybe another sweater.
- No. California's not that cold, is it?

668
00:59:09,871 --> 00:59:13,287
OK, listen.
I want you to be a good boy, OK?

669
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:15,789
- Don't give anybody a hard time.
- OK.

670
00:59:16,587 --> 00:59:18,793
Gimme a kiss.

671
00:59:25,556 --> 00:59:28,080
- We'll call when we land.
- Yeah, we'll call.

672
00:59:52,174 --> 00:59:54,176
<i>~ I been told by ~</i>

673
00:59:55,729 --> 00:59:58,813
<i>~ Some people, and they all ~</i>

674
00:59:59,399 --> 01:00:01,641
<i>~ Say to take you back ~</i>

675
01:00:03,945 --> 01:00:06,780
<i>~ Take you back like before ~</i>

676
01:00:07,991 --> 01:00:11,241
<i>~ I don't call that a reason ~</i>

677
01:00:12,245 --> 01:00:17,915
<i>~ I just call it believin' in myself ~</i>

678
01:00:18,668 --> 01:00:21,040
<i>~ Believin' in myself ~</i>

679
01:00:23,165 --> 01:00:26,333
- What the hell are we doin' in LA?
- This is where I started.

680
01:00:26,468 --> 01:00:28,793
- So?
- So this is where he's startin'.

681
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:31,633
This place is disgusting.
Let's stay at your place.

682
01:00:31,765 --> 01:00:35,430
You're missin' the point.
Let's check in and get over to the gym.

683
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:39,854
Rock, we don't need this.
It's below your standards.

684
01:00:39,981 --> 01:00:43,148
We gotta give it a try, Paulie.
Come on, Adrian.

685
01:00:52,202 --> 01:00:54,491
<i>~ I don't call that a reason ~</i>

686
01:00:54,621 --> 01:00:56,578
I don't even have a gun.

687
01:00:56,706 --> 01:01:01,119
<i>~ I just call it believin' in myself ~</i>

688
01:01:02,629 --> 01:01:03,954
<i>~ Believin' in myself... ~</i>

689
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:07,748
Fun is fun. I like those kind of things,
but this, I don't like.

690
01:01:07,884 --> 01:01:13,341
Look at this place. Rats even have
more pride than to be caught dead here.

691
01:01:13,473 --> 01:01:16,924
I mean, look at the dump.
I just don't like it.

692
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,977
- Think of Adrian's health.
- I'm fine, Paulie.

693
01:01:36,454 --> 01:01:38,661
Check this out.

694
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:49,925
Yeah. Yeah...

695
01:01:51,303 --> 01:01:55,550
- This is where I started.
- That's your problem.

696
01:01:55,682 --> 01:01:59,015
Rocko,
let's leave before they leave us for dead.

697
01:02:00,979 --> 01:02:05,024
Yeah.
You see that look in their eyes, Rock?

698
01:02:05,358 --> 01:02:08,525
When we fought, I trained hard
but I didn't have that look.

699
01:02:08,653 --> 01:02:10,776
You had it and you won.

700
01:02:12,407 --> 01:02:14,447
Gotta get that look back, Rock.

701
01:02:14,826 --> 01:02:18,112
Eye of the tiger, man.
Eye of the tiger. Come on.

702
01:02:18,246 --> 01:02:20,239
Come on, let's go.

703
01:02:20,373 --> 01:02:23,244
Look at this place. No class in here.

704
01:02:23,376 --> 01:02:25,950
- Is he always so cheerful?
- I don't sweat you.

705
01:02:26,087 --> 01:02:29,670
- Hey, Paulie. Don't get mentally irregular.
- It's a free country.

706
01:02:29,799 --> 01:02:34,011
- Just don't get irregular.
- I don't need no philosophy lesson.

707
01:02:34,137 --> 01:02:38,550
- It takes six years to get to know him.
- I ain't got six years.

708
01:02:38,683 --> 01:02:41,055
Come on, Paulie, just relax. Come on.

709
01:02:42,395 --> 01:02:44,435
We're on business.

710
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50,850
- Hey! Hey, champ!
- Hey, Duke, my man!

711
01:02:50,987 --> 01:02:54,237
- Hey, everything's set up.
- Good. I know you know this man.

712
01:02:54,366 --> 01:02:57,948
Yeah. It's gonna be good workin'
with you and not against you.

713
01:02:58,078 --> 01:02:59,821
- How you feel?
- Pretty good, thanks.

714
01:02:59,955 --> 01:03:02,742
We've been livin' modern.
Now we're gonna train old.

715
01:03:02,874 --> 01:03:04,950
I'm goin' over here to talk to the guys.

716
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:07,124
Hey! The champ is home.

717
01:03:09,506 --> 01:03:13,504
- We gotta leave. I got a reputation.
- What do you mean, reputation?

718
01:03:13,635 --> 01:03:17,253
- You heard. I don't like these people.
- You don't like 'em?

719
01:03:19,307 --> 01:03:22,142
Well, maybe they don't
like you either, Paulie.

720
01:03:22,269 --> 01:03:25,020
What'd I do to them?

721
01:03:25,146 --> 01:03:27,186
And they call me punchy.

722
01:03:27,315 --> 01:03:31,894
- Stallion. Come over and meet the fellas.
- I'll be right back.

723
01:03:32,028 --> 01:03:34,068
How you doin', guys?

724
01:03:45,083 --> 01:03:47,870
That's it, that's it.
Come on, on the toes. On the toes!

725
01:03:48,003 --> 01:03:51,835
On the toes. On the toes. On the toes.

726
01:03:53,383 --> 01:03:55,423
Come on, Rock.

727
01:03:55,552 --> 01:03:59,502
- He ain't too graceful.
- That's why we're here, Paulie.

728
01:03:59,723 --> 01:04:02,392
Waste of time. He's got heavy feet.

729
01:04:02,517 --> 01:04:05,518
Get on the balls of your feet.
Come on, relax, Rock.

730
01:04:06,021 --> 01:04:10,065
- Come on, get those feet outta concrete.
- It'll take time but it'll come.

731
01:04:10,191 --> 01:04:13,395
He can't train to the jungle junk music.

732
01:04:14,112 --> 01:04:18,608
Come on, relax, Rock.
On the balls of your feet. Find the rhythm.

733
01:04:18,742 --> 01:04:21,315
We'll start a new dance called the crawl.

734
01:04:21,453 --> 01:04:25,700
You can't train him like a coloured fighter.
He ain't got no rhythm.

735
01:04:25,999 --> 01:04:26,999
Come on.

736
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:29,248
- How stupid do I look!
- You look great.

737
01:04:29,461 --> 01:04:31,952
Everything we do works out the jab.
Good.

738
01:04:35,342 --> 01:04:38,545
- Can he swim?
- With a name like Rock?

739
01:04:38,678 --> 01:04:42,462
No time to waste. Let's go!
Another lap. Move it.

740
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:46,383
- Another lap.
- He ain't no tuna. We belong in the gym.

741
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:48,595
He's usin' muscles he never knew he had.

742
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:53,107
Come on, Rock. Stretch now.
Move it, Rock. Move it.

743
01:04:53,318 --> 01:04:56,734
Nobody can change that much.
He's a bruiser. He ain't no boxer.

744
01:04:56,863 --> 01:05:00,149
You keep tellin' him that
and he'll be nothin'.

745
01:05:00,283 --> 01:05:03,783
Another lap. Come on now!
Move it. Move it!

746
01:05:03,912 --> 01:05:07,660
Come on. Move it, Rock.
Come on! Let's go. Let's go.

747
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:09,910
That's it, stretch it out.

748
01:05:10,043 --> 01:05:13,044
That's it. You gotta pull. Hard, now. Hard.

749
01:05:21,137 --> 01:05:24,637
Shut up, ya Sterno bums! I'll squash ya.

750
01:05:24,766 --> 01:05:27,008
There's decent people tryin' to sleep!

751
01:05:27,143 --> 01:05:29,895
Shut up, you honky scum bastard mother!

752
01:05:30,021 --> 01:05:33,473
Who needs this sick place? I don't.

753
01:05:35,235 --> 01:05:37,274
No class.

754
01:05:40,323 --> 01:05:42,649
Damn, that Clubber's strong.

755
01:05:42,784 --> 01:05:45,868
15 rounds is a long time.

756
01:05:46,580 --> 01:05:48,619
We gotta put him away early.

757
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:55,161
I figure with the pace we gotta set, Rock
can last maybe seven or eight rounds.

758
01:05:56,631 --> 01:05:59,003
Then we'll be out of steam, man.

759
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,793
We got to put him away early.

760
01:06:05,473 --> 01:06:08,427
At least the water's hot.

761
01:06:10,562 --> 01:06:13,017
Well, we never really had a honeymoon.

762
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,440
It's not so bad.

763
01:06:19,571 --> 01:06:22,240
You've been in worse places.

764
01:06:22,949 --> 01:06:25,274
<i>Rocky's in trouble in round two.</i>

765
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:29,075
<i>He takes a right.</i>
<i>He's been cut! Rocky's been cut!</i>

766
01:06:30,999 --> 01:06:33,038
Come on, Rock. Come on, now.

767
01:06:34,210 --> 01:06:36,536
Let's go. You gotta get tougher.

768
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,708
Think smooth. Bounce. Bounce. Bounce.

769
01:06:40,342 --> 01:06:43,675
On your toes, Rock.
On your toes. On your toes!

770
01:06:44,971 --> 01:06:47,343
Push yourself, Rock! Concentrate.

771
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:51,466
Let's move it, Rock.
Move it now. Come on!

772
01:06:51,603 --> 01:06:53,761
Have fun with it.

773
01:06:53,897 --> 01:06:56,566
That's it. Easy, easy, easy.

774
01:06:59,194 --> 01:07:01,352
Don't push it. Let it come.

775
01:07:01,488 --> 01:07:05,236
It'll come. It just takes time, baby.

776
01:07:05,492 --> 01:07:08,825
Move your head, move your head.
Up and down.

777
01:07:08,954 --> 01:07:11,361
Come on, come on.

778
01:07:11,498 --> 01:07:15,116
In and out. Inside. Inside. Inside, baby.

779
01:07:15,669 --> 01:07:20,129
- Side to side. Move your head.
- Watch him. He's got two hands, right?

780
01:07:25,011 --> 01:07:29,969
Damn, man! What the hell are you doin'?
This guy will knock you on your ass!

781
01:07:31,685 --> 01:07:33,843
Come on, Rock, it's not a game.

782
01:07:33,979 --> 01:07:37,763
You wanna live in a hospital
for five weeks this time?

783
01:07:37,899 --> 01:07:41,434
- You thought I was tough. He'll kill ya!
- All right.

784
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:46,113
Come on. Get your head on your
shoulders, man. Think about the fight.

785
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:49,325
Clubber Lang's in here.
He's tryin' to hurt you, Rock.

786
01:07:49,452 --> 01:07:52,240
Here it comes. Jab! He's jabbin'.

787
01:07:52,539 --> 01:07:56,537
He's tryin' to hurt you.
You gotta fight him. You gotta move.

788
01:07:57,669 --> 01:08:01,714
<i>He's up against the ropes.</i>
<i>He can't get out of the corner!</i>

789
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:07,918
He's hookin'! He's hookin'! He's hookin'!

790
01:08:08,054 --> 01:08:10,094
Damn, Rock! Come on!

791
01:08:11,016 --> 01:08:14,550
- What's the matter with you?
- Tomorrow. We'll do it tomorrow.

792
01:08:14,686 --> 01:08:17,224
There is no tomorrow!

793
01:08:17,898 --> 01:08:19,937
There is no tomorrow!

794
01:08:20,442 --> 01:08:22,481
<i>There is no tomorrow!</i>

795
01:08:28,199 --> 01:08:31,403
There's one thing you gotta remember.
We gotta get some speed.

796
01:08:31,536 --> 01:08:35,700
You gotta get some flexibility. You
gotta get some quickness. Understand?

797
01:08:35,832 --> 01:08:40,209
Quickness, endurance. That's all we
gotta concern ourselves with, Rock.

798
01:08:40,337 --> 01:08:42,744
Mickey never had me do this.

799
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:46,296
Yeah. OK, here we go.

800
01:08:47,969 --> 01:08:49,629
Ready.

801
01:08:53,350 --> 01:08:55,389
Set... Go!

802
01:08:58,897 --> 01:09:01,186
Come on. Come on.

803
01:09:08,323 --> 01:09:10,362
Come on.

804
01:09:11,409 --> 01:09:13,616
<i>You can't win, Rock.</i>

805
01:09:14,871 --> 01:09:17,955
<i>You ain't been hungry</i>
<i>since you won that belt.</i>

806
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:21,331
<i>He'll knock ya into tomorrow!</i>

807
01:10:05,297 --> 01:10:07,538
What's the matter?

808
01:10:08,133 --> 01:10:11,087
It's over. It's all over.

809
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,936
What's the matter with you?

810
01:11:00,101 --> 01:11:02,094
Can I talk to you?

811
01:11:06,524 --> 01:11:10,439
I wanna ask you something important,
and I want you to tell me the truth.

812
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:14,650
- What?
- Why'd you come here?

813
01:11:16,034 --> 01:11:18,442
I just don't want it no more.

814
01:11:18,745 --> 01:11:24,166
- If it's over cos you want it to be, I'm glad.
- I do.

815
01:11:25,335 --> 01:11:29,498
It's just, you've never quit
anything since I've known you.

816
01:11:33,426 --> 01:11:37,590
I don't know what you want me to say.
I mean, what happened?

817
01:11:37,722 --> 01:11:40,296
How did everything
that was so good get so bad?

818
01:11:41,643 --> 01:11:43,849
What's so bad? Tell me. What?

819
01:11:43,979 --> 01:11:47,098
I wrecked everything
by not thinking for myself.

820
01:11:47,232 --> 01:11:50,683
Why couldn't Mickey tell me
where it was really at from the start?

821
01:11:50,819 --> 01:11:55,528
He didn't have to carry me and lie and
make me think I was better than I was.

822
01:11:55,657 --> 01:11:59,073
- He never lied.
- Those fights weren't right.

823
01:11:59,202 --> 01:12:01,325
I never fought anybody in their prime.

824
01:12:01,454 --> 01:12:05,499
There was always some angle to keep
the title longer than I shoulda had it.

825
01:12:05,625 --> 01:12:07,499
Do you understand?

826
01:12:07,627 --> 01:12:12,040
You've gotta understand, he loved you!
That was his job, protecting you.

827
01:12:12,173 --> 01:12:15,507
Protectin' don't help nothin'.
It makes things worse.

828
01:12:15,635 --> 01:12:20,843
You wake up one day thinking you're
a winner, but you're not. You're a loser.

829
01:12:20,974 --> 01:12:23,761
So we wouldn't have had
the title as long. So what?

830
01:12:23,893 --> 01:12:26,811
- At least it would have been real.
- It was real!

831
01:12:26,938 --> 01:12:29,608
Nothing is real
if you don't believe in who you are.

832
01:12:29,774 --> 01:12:32,063
I don't believe in myself no more!

833
01:12:32,193 --> 01:12:35,562
When a fighter don't believe,
he's finished. That's it.

834
01:12:35,697 --> 01:12:38,781
That's not it.
Why don't you tell me the truth?

835
01:12:38,909 --> 01:12:42,112
What are you puttin' me through?
You wanna know the truth?

836
01:12:42,245 --> 01:12:44,285
I don't wanna lose what I got.

837
01:12:44,414 --> 01:12:48,827
At first, I didn't care about what happened.
I'd go in the ring, get bust up.

838
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:52,080
But now there's you and the kid.
I don't wanna lose what I got!

839
01:12:52,213 --> 01:12:57,884
What do we have that can't be replaced?
What? A house. We got cars, money.

840
01:12:58,011 --> 01:13:01,676
We got everything but the truth.
What's the truth, dammit?!

841
01:13:01,806 --> 01:13:03,965
I'm afraid! All right?

842
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:07,434
You wanna hear me say it?
You wanna break me down? I'm afraid.

843
01:13:07,562 --> 01:13:09,555
For the first time, I'm afraid.

844
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:12,726
I'm afraid too.
There's nothin' wrong with that.

845
01:13:12,859 --> 01:13:15,730
- There is. For me, there is.
- Why? You're human.

846
01:13:15,862 --> 01:13:20,323
I don't know what I am. I know I'm a liar,
and because of that, Mickey ain't here.

847
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:25,159
You didn't push him into anything. He was
a grown man. He did what he had to do.

848
01:13:25,288 --> 01:13:27,993
And you have no right to feel guilty.
You don't!

849
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:31,626
You were a champion.
You did what you were expected to do.

850
01:13:31,753 --> 01:13:34,244
You did what everybody
thought you should do.

851
01:13:34,381 --> 01:13:38,592
And you wanna tell me that those fights
weren't real? I don't believe it!

852
01:13:39,135 --> 01:13:43,429
It doesn't matter what I believe.
You've got to carry that fear inside you,

853
01:13:43,556 --> 01:13:48,633
afraid everybody'll take things away,
that you'll be remembered as a coward,

854
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:52,519
that you're not a man any more.
Well, none of it's true.

855
01:13:52,649 --> 01:13:57,358
It doesn't matter if I tell you because
you're the one that's got to settle it.

856
01:13:57,487 --> 01:14:02,730
Get rid of it! Cos when the smoke clears,
and they stop chanting your name,

857
01:14:02,867 --> 01:14:04,575
it's just gonna be us.

858
01:14:04,703 --> 01:14:08,119
And you can't live like this.
We can't live like this.

859
01:14:08,248 --> 01:14:13,491
Cos it's gonna bother you for the rest of
your life. Look what it's doing to you now.

860
01:14:18,675 --> 01:14:22,091
Apollo thinks you can do it. So do I.

861
01:14:22,804 --> 01:14:27,181
But you gotta wanna do it for the right
reasons. Not for the guilt over Mickey.

862
01:14:27,309 --> 01:14:32,765
Not for the people, not for the title,
not for money, or me - but for you.

863
01:14:33,607 --> 01:14:35,646
Just you. Just you alone.

864
01:14:39,613 --> 01:14:43,147
- And if I lose?
- Then you lose.

865
01:14:43,283 --> 01:14:48,075
But at least you lose with no excuses.
No fear.

866
01:14:48,204 --> 01:14:51,620
And I know you could live with that.

867
01:14:58,590 --> 01:15:01,377
How'd you get so tough?

868
01:15:02,594 --> 01:15:05,049
I live with a fighter.

869
01:15:11,186 --> 01:15:13,511
I really love you.

870
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:22,109
I love you.

871
01:15:45,011 --> 01:15:48,345
No, no, no. Rock, no.
Just flick it. Just flick it.

872
01:15:53,687 --> 01:15:55,726
Faster! Faster!

873
01:16:08,868 --> 01:16:11,194
Good. Five more laps.

874
01:16:13,248 --> 01:16:14,790
Punch it!

875
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:17,204
On your toes!

876
01:16:19,963 --> 01:16:23,795
<i>~ Gonna fly now ~</i>

877
01:16:25,051 --> 01:16:29,547
<i>~ It's all right now ~</i>

878
01:16:30,015 --> 01:16:34,593
<i>~ Flying high now... ~</i>

879
01:16:45,155 --> 01:16:47,194
Jab out! Get him!

880
01:16:49,284 --> 01:16:51,323
Gotta move it faster.

881
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,408
Faster! Faster! Kick it!

882
01:17:02,047 --> 01:17:03,541
Very nice!

883
01:17:19,314 --> 01:17:21,639
Move your head. Beautiful!

884
01:17:22,067 --> 01:17:25,270
That's right. Under! Under and over.

885
01:17:25,403 --> 01:17:27,977
Send him out!

886
01:17:35,038 --> 01:17:39,783
<i>~ Feeling strong now ~</i>

887
01:17:39,918 --> 01:17:42,788
<i>~ Nothing wrong now ~</i>

888
01:17:42,921 --> 01:17:45,626
Faster. Faster. Yeah!

889
01:17:50,637 --> 01:17:53,210
Now! Yeah!

890
01:17:55,433 --> 01:17:58,221
Hey, Rocky the fish!

891
01:17:58,353 --> 01:18:00,013
Yeah! Yeah!

892
01:18:29,009 --> 01:18:33,801
<i>~ Gonna fly now ~</i>

893
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:38,592
<i>~ Nothin' wrong now ~</i>

894
01:18:38,727 --> 01:18:43,934
<i>~ Gonna fly ~</i>

895
01:18:44,399 --> 01:18:49,026
<i>~ Fly, fly ~</i>

896
01:18:49,154 --> 01:18:52,653
<i>~ Fly ~</i>

897
01:18:54,451 --> 01:18:56,739
<i>Good evening.</i>
<i>I'm Stu Nahan, with Bill Baldwin.</i>

898
01:18:56,870 --> 01:18:59,622
<i>We welcome you</i>
<i>to Madison Square Garden.</i>

899
01:18:59,748 --> 01:19:02,369
It's the anxiously awaited rematch

900
01:19:02,500 --> 01:19:07,495
between former champion Rocky Balboa
and the reigning champion Clubber Lang.

901
01:19:07,672 --> 01:19:11,966
We now switch to our remote
cameras inside the dressing rooms.

902
01:19:12,093 --> 01:19:15,925
Would you comment on how you plan
to fight Balboa? What's your strategy?

903
01:19:16,056 --> 01:19:19,057
Don't need any.
Balboa's so predictable and stupid.

904
01:19:19,184 --> 01:19:23,395
The man comes straight ahead. He's
tailor-made for me. He's gonna get hurt.

905
01:19:24,689 --> 01:19:28,023
- That's good.
- Turn 'em over. Good?

906
01:19:28,151 --> 01:19:30,607
How does that look? OK?

907
01:19:30,737 --> 01:19:33,358
No, I don't hate Balboa. But I pity the fool.

908
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:37,534
And I will destroy
any man who tries to take what I got.

909
01:19:40,872 --> 01:19:43,707
Remember where you came from.

910
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:47,202
Remember what it took to get you here.

911
01:19:47,337 --> 01:19:50,124
And remember what
he did to you last time, right?

912
01:19:50,298 --> 01:19:53,999
Both are brawlers, with the edge
and power going to Clubber Lang,

913
01:19:54,135 --> 01:19:58,347
so I would say the odds are very long
against Balboa regaining his title.

914
01:19:58,807 --> 01:20:02,176
Now it's your turn. It's your turn, huh?

915
01:20:03,979 --> 01:20:06,018
What's your prediction for the fight?

916
01:20:06,147 --> 01:20:10,441
- Prediction?
- Yes. Prediction.

917
01:20:10,569 --> 01:20:12,360
Pain.

918
01:20:12,487 --> 01:20:15,488
Lang likes to hurt a man to the body.

919
01:20:15,615 --> 01:20:18,782
And Balboa may never have
psychologically recovered

920
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:21,828
from that vicious knockout
that Clubber laid on him.

921
01:20:23,582 --> 01:20:25,621
It's time.

922
01:20:26,876 --> 01:20:28,916
- Here.
- What?

923
01:20:31,631 --> 01:20:34,122
I want you to wear these.

924
01:20:35,844 --> 01:20:40,719
Come on, Apollo. These are the colours
that you wore in our first fight together.

925
01:20:40,849 --> 01:20:43,422
I... I can't wear your colours.

926
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:46,098
Just wear 'em.

927
01:20:46,229 --> 01:20:48,269
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

928
01:20:49,274 --> 01:20:50,851
Thanks, Apollo.

929
01:20:50,984 --> 01:20:53,985
Just make sure you wash 'em
before you bring 'em back.

930
01:20:54,112 --> 01:20:56,318
Will do. Will do.

931
01:20:57,032 --> 01:20:59,867
- Thanks, Apollo.
- Hey, and remember,

932
01:20:59,993 --> 01:21:02,069
after this you owe me a favour.

933
01:21:02,662 --> 01:21:04,287
What favour?

934
01:21:04,414 --> 01:21:09,076
I'd have to agree. Toe to toe, Lang is
devastating, and he's much too strong.

935
01:21:09,210 --> 01:21:11,666
Rocky! Rocky!

936
01:21:11,796 --> 01:21:14,334
Listen. I wanna tell you
that I'm proud of you.

937
01:21:14,466 --> 01:21:18,131
It takes a helluva man to change,
and you did it. Prove it to 'em, right?

938
01:21:18,261 --> 01:21:20,384
- You did good, Apollo.
- Thanks, Paulie.

939
01:21:20,513 --> 01:21:22,553
Let's do it, Paulie.

940
01:21:23,683 --> 01:21:27,977
Here come Rocky and Apollo,
the two former champions.

941
01:21:34,861 --> 01:21:37,696
Look at the tenseness in his face,
that taut body.

942
01:21:37,822 --> 01:21:40,396
- Boy, does he look serious right now.
- He does.

943
01:21:40,533 --> 01:21:45,492
You know, Stu, the word is that this is
Rocky's last fight - win, lose or draw.

944
01:21:45,622 --> 01:21:50,200
There he is, the Italian Stallion,
Rocky Balboa, climbing into the ring.

945
01:21:50,335 --> 01:21:54,878
Boy, he looks incredibly thin.
I'd say he's gotta be about 20lb lighter.

946
01:21:55,006 --> 01:21:57,793
Rocky Balboa,
the iron man from Philadelphia.

947
01:21:57,926 --> 01:22:00,880
This crowd is with him tonight. Listen.

948
01:22:02,806 --> 01:22:05,213
Balboa doesn't really have
any boxing skills.

949
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:08,055
But I've never seen as much
raw determination...

950
01:22:08,186 --> 01:22:10,095
Hold it, Stu.

951
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:13,848
Here comes the champion now,
Clubber Lang. Look at this crowd.

952
01:22:15,986 --> 01:22:21,656
Look at those eyes. I've never seen
a guy with such sullen eyes. He is tough.

953
01:22:21,783 --> 01:22:24,903
Clubber, go back where you came from!

954
01:22:26,329 --> 01:22:29,829
He even belted a spectator.
Did you see that? Look at that man.

955
01:22:29,958 --> 01:22:33,872
Boy, awesome. Man, he's tough.

956
01:22:34,004 --> 01:22:38,048
Clubber Lang,
the heavyweight champion of the world!

957
01:22:38,466 --> 01:22:40,755
Hey, fool! You ready for another beatin'?

958
01:22:40,885 --> 01:22:43,092
You should've never came back!

959
01:22:43,221 --> 01:22:45,593
- Don't look at him.
- Let's just be cool.

960
01:22:45,849 --> 01:22:47,806
Hey, boy.

961
01:22:47,934 --> 01:22:51,884
Hey, boy. After I crucify him, you're next.

962
01:22:52,063 --> 01:22:55,432
- Just stay outta my face, chump.
- Don't turn your back on me.

963
01:22:55,567 --> 01:22:58,521
We got a brawl before the bell.

964
01:22:59,321 --> 01:23:01,444
This ring is ready to explode!

965
01:23:01,573 --> 01:23:04,740
With the fight about to officially begin...

966
01:23:06,286 --> 01:23:09,821
- I'm gonna get you! Let him go!
- Come on!

967
01:23:09,956 --> 01:23:12,115
Let him go! I want him!

968
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:14,290
- You said be cool.
- That was cool.

969
01:23:14,419 --> 01:23:17,373
I'm the champ!
I'll beat ya like I did last time.

970
01:23:17,505 --> 01:23:20,506
You won't have to look to find me.
I'm here.

971
01:23:20,634 --> 01:23:23,800
Boxing fans around the world,

972
01:23:23,929 --> 01:23:26,550
welcome to Madison Square Garden

973
01:23:26,681 --> 01:23:30,679
and tonight's heavyweight
championship of the world!

974
01:23:32,938 --> 01:23:34,977
Out of the red corner,

975
01:23:35,106 --> 01:23:40,148
the challenger, weighing 191 lb,

976
01:23:40,278 --> 01:23:43,694
from the fighting city of Philadelphia,

977
01:23:43,823 --> 01:23:47,074
the former heavyweight
champion of the world,

978
01:23:47,202 --> 01:23:49,360
the Italian Stallion,

979
01:23:49,496 --> 01:23:55,036
Rocky Balboa!

980
01:24:00,382 --> 01:24:03,916
I tell ya, he has so slimmed down,
he looks like a middleweight.

981
01:24:04,552 --> 01:24:09,974
Out of the blue corner, weighing 237lb,

982
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:13,303
the hard-punching pedlar from Chicago,

983
01:24:13,478 --> 01:24:17,606
the reigning heavyweight
champion of the world,

984
01:24:17,732 --> 01:24:20,769
Clubber Lang!

985
01:24:21,778 --> 01:24:24,150
Referee, Lou Filippo.

986
01:24:24,823 --> 01:24:26,946
OK, boys. Let's go.

987
01:24:27,617 --> 01:24:31,200
We went over the rules yesterday.
I'm gonna repeat a few of 'em.

988
01:24:31,329 --> 01:24:33,536
Watch your low blows
and rabbit punches.

989
01:24:33,665 --> 01:24:36,500
In case of a knockdown,
go to the corner I tell you to,

990
01:24:36,626 --> 01:24:39,378
and you stay there
until I tell you to come out.

991
01:24:39,504 --> 01:24:42,339
Is that understood? Any questions?

992
01:24:42,465 --> 01:24:44,707
Let's go back to your corner now.
Let's go.

993
01:24:45,927 --> 01:24:49,510
- I'm gonna bust you up.
- Go for it.

994
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:56,393
Here we go. The war is on!
We're just waiting for the bell.

995
01:24:56,521 --> 01:24:58,810
Take my belt off. I'll get that chump.

996
01:24:58,940 --> 01:25:02,356
Don't let this bum let you fight his fight.
You're the best!

997
01:25:03,403 --> 01:25:05,111
Hell.

998
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:08,815
Rhythm and power. Then jab him.

999
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:10,990
Rocky! Rocky!

1000
01:25:14,289 --> 01:25:16,910
It should be a great fight!

1001
01:25:18,168 --> 01:25:22,379
Balboa goes right out of his corner
and right after Clubber Lang.

1002
01:25:22,505 --> 01:25:26,455
He's going right to left, into Clubber's
face. What a start to the fight!

1003
01:25:26,593 --> 01:25:29,547
Another jab. Another jab.

1004
01:25:30,096 --> 01:25:33,263
And another!
This is not the Rocky we expected!

1005
01:25:33,558 --> 01:25:35,681
Looks fantastic.

1006
01:25:38,980 --> 01:25:43,476
Another right. And a right.
Look at that! A right and left to the head!

1007
01:25:43,610 --> 01:25:48,106
Clubber Lang doesn't know what's
happening. He's being stung by this style.

1008
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:51,110
Look at the shots he's taking.

1009
01:25:53,161 --> 01:25:57,989
- He can't corner the fleet-footed fighter.
- It's absolutely unbelievable!

1010
01:25:59,668 --> 01:26:02,503
Come on, you oversized hick!
Bring it to me! Hit me!

1011
01:26:02,629 --> 01:26:05,416
That right hand is like a triphammer!

1012
01:26:08,927 --> 01:26:11,299
- Rock, tie him up!
- Bring it to me! Hit me!

1013
01:26:11,805 --> 01:26:14,343
Come on, get back. Get back!

1014
01:26:14,474 --> 01:26:17,392
Tough first round!

1015
01:26:17,519 --> 01:26:20,188
There's Rocky
with a couple of rights and lefts.

1016
01:26:20,313 --> 01:26:22,520
Get off! Get off!

1017
01:26:23,358 --> 01:26:26,193
This crowd is going absolutely wild.

1018
01:26:52,637 --> 01:26:57,050
We got pandemonium in the ring
at the end of round one.

1019
01:26:57,183 --> 01:27:01,098
Lang wants more.
He can't realise that the round is over!

1020
01:27:03,315 --> 01:27:07,562
All right, you looked great.
Just don't get crazy and we're home.

1021
01:27:07,694 --> 01:27:10,529
- I'll kill you, man
- The man is strong.

1022
01:27:10,655 --> 01:27:13,941
I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna kill him.

1023
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:17,700
Now he's gonna come hard, right?

1024
01:27:17,829 --> 01:27:22,954
- Don't give him a chance to settle.
- Counter and move. Counter and move.

1025
01:27:23,084 --> 01:27:26,204
He had Lang at his mercy!

1026
01:27:30,592 --> 01:27:34,459
Now it's Lang coming out for Rocky.

1027
01:27:35,472 --> 01:27:40,549
Rocky has him in his corner
and is still landing rights and lefts.

1028
01:27:41,269 --> 01:27:43,476
A right to the head. Another.

1029
01:27:43,605 --> 01:27:47,353
He's really setting him up.
Five unanswered shots!

1030
01:27:48,693 --> 01:27:51,445
Kill him! Kill him!

1031
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:56,942
- Get outta there!
- Get back!

1032
01:28:02,249 --> 01:28:04,918
All right!

1033
01:28:06,962 --> 01:28:09,085
Break it up. Break it up.

1034
01:28:09,214 --> 01:28:12,417
- What are you doin'?
- Come on, Balboa.

1035
01:28:14,302 --> 01:28:16,591
Get your hands up. Come on, Rock!

1036
01:28:18,056 --> 01:28:20,725
That right hand hurt Rocky again!

1037
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:25,513
Balboa's in trouble now.

1038
01:28:29,776 --> 01:28:32,314
Hold him, dammit!

1039
01:28:33,572 --> 01:28:37,949
- Come on, Rocky!
- This is Clubber's round.

1040
01:28:43,873 --> 01:28:45,913
And Balboa is down.

1041
01:28:47,168 --> 01:28:49,659
- Get up, dammit!
- Come on.

1042
01:28:50,297 --> 01:28:52,538
- Five!
- He's in trouble.

1043
01:28:52,674 --> 01:28:54,916
Six!

1044
01:28:55,051 --> 01:28:56,961
Seven!

1045
01:28:58,096 --> 01:29:02,260
It's Clubber again. Lang with the left hand.
Another left and a right!

1046
01:29:04,894 --> 01:29:07,136
And down goes Balboa again.

1047
01:29:08,607 --> 01:29:10,184
Stop the fight.

1048
01:29:10,609 --> 01:29:13,859
- Six!
- I got some more, so get up.

1049
01:29:14,321 --> 01:29:16,360
I got a lotta moves. Come on!

1050
01:29:16,489 --> 01:29:19,407
Here we go again.
Clubber coming into him!

1051
01:29:24,372 --> 01:29:27,492
You ain't so bad. You ain't so bad.

1052
01:29:28,335 --> 01:29:30,493
You ain't so bad. You ain't nothin!

1053
01:29:30,629 --> 01:29:33,713
You must be crazy.
You're just a stupid fool.

1054
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:37,624
- But I ain't breathin' heavy.
- He's a fool. He's stupid.

1055
01:29:37,761 --> 01:29:39,884
How could he come back
from that beating?

1056
01:29:40,013 --> 01:29:42,219
What the hell are you doin'?

1057
01:29:42,349 --> 01:29:46,216
- It's a strategy. I know what I'm doin'.
- You don't know.

1058
01:29:46,353 --> 01:29:50,053
- He's gotta come to you.
- He's nothin'. He's mine.

1059
01:29:50,190 --> 01:29:54,567
Stand toe to toe with this bum and
he'll kill you. He'll beat your head off.

1060
01:29:54,694 --> 01:29:56,603
He's gettin' tired.

1061
01:29:57,530 --> 01:30:01,824
Don't go wasting your punches.
Don't try to take him out with one punch.

1062
01:30:01,993 --> 01:30:05,279
Use your head. You wear him down.
He's all ours.

1063
01:30:05,664 --> 01:30:07,324
I know what I'm doin'.

1064
01:30:07,457 --> 01:30:11,870
Don't tell me what you think!
Go out there and do it. Eye of the tiger.

1065
01:30:13,505 --> 01:30:16,874
Knock his head off. He's just a man.

1066
01:30:17,634 --> 01:30:21,466
Be more man than him.
Go get him. Eye of the tiger.

1067
01:30:24,349 --> 01:30:29,260
Round three - tough round to call.
This is a little slower...

1068
01:30:29,396 --> 01:30:31,472
It's my round.

1069
01:30:31,606 --> 01:30:34,524
I'm gonna take ya this time.

1070
01:30:34,651 --> 01:30:36,940
You're mine. You're mine.

1071
01:30:37,070 --> 01:30:39,857
- Come on. Come on.
- I'm gonna get ya.

1072
01:30:52,502 --> 01:30:55,123
Get outta there.

1073
01:30:58,925 --> 01:31:01,001
Get outta there!

1074
01:31:01,136 --> 01:31:03,674
- Come on.
- Stick him.

1075
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:09,140
Come on!

1076
01:31:10,604 --> 01:31:12,228
Again, again!

1077
01:31:12,439 --> 01:31:16,187
- He's gettin' killed
- No, no, no, he's not. He's gettin' mad.

1078
01:31:16,318 --> 01:31:19,022
The whole world's watching.
Knock me out.

1079
01:31:20,655 --> 01:31:23,360
Harder! Can you hit hard? Hit me harder!

1080
01:31:30,498 --> 01:31:32,408
Get outta there!

1081
01:31:34,377 --> 01:31:36,833
Rocky!

1082
01:31:41,468 --> 01:31:42,962
Yeah!

1083
01:31:43,803 --> 01:31:46,092
My mother hits harder than that. Come on!

1084
01:31:46,222 --> 01:31:48,429
A little harder. Hit me on the face.

1085
01:31:50,143 --> 01:31:52,266
Come on, champ. You ain't so bad.

1086
01:31:52,854 --> 01:31:54,977
You ain't nothin'.

1087
01:31:57,442 --> 01:31:58,901
Rocky!

1088
01:31:59,027 --> 01:32:01,898
Rocky! Rocky!

1089
01:32:14,918 --> 01:32:18,666
I might believe the strategy now.
He's making Clubber miss!

1090
01:32:18,797 --> 01:32:23,257
He drew him in. Now Rocky's throwing
the punches. Look at the punches.

1091
01:32:25,345 --> 01:32:29,888
He's lifting him right off
the canvas with those punches!

1092
01:32:34,604 --> 01:32:36,644
He's completely psyched out!

1093
01:32:38,316 --> 01:32:41,021
Lang is confused by all of this!

1094
01:33:14,603 --> 01:33:15,931
Come on!

1095
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:30,156
The place is going bananas!

1096
01:33:30,827 --> 01:33:33,152
- Get up!
- Five!

1097
01:33:33,288 --> 01:33:34,403
Six!

1098
01:33:34,873 --> 01:33:36,533
Seven!

1099
01:33:36,666 --> 01:33:38,706
Eight! Nine!

1100
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,498
Ten. You're out.

1101
01:33:50,555 --> 01:33:56,558
There he is, the new heavyweight
champion of the world, Rocky Balboa!

1102
01:33:58,897 --> 01:34:00,936
Rocky is exhausted.

1103
01:34:06,321 --> 01:34:10,153
Ladies and gentlemen,
the winner by knockout...

1104
01:34:10,283 --> 01:34:14,495
- Are you all right?
- Never better. Never better.

1105
01:34:15,705 --> 01:34:20,166
...the heavyweight champion of the world,
the Italian Stallion,

1106
01:34:20,293 --> 01:34:23,128
Rocky Balboa!

1107
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:36,344
- We made a deal.
- I know, but this is extremely crazy.

1108
01:34:36,476 --> 01:34:38,516
Yeah. Mentally irregular, right?

1109
01:34:38,645 --> 01:34:41,397
But it makes sense. You owe me a favour.

1110
01:34:41,523 --> 01:34:44,393
I know, but... When did you think of this?

1111
01:34:44,526 --> 01:34:48,226
- About three years ago.
- This is very crazy, Apollo.

1112
01:34:48,363 --> 01:34:53,523
Stallion, when you won that last fight,
you beat me by one second.

1113
01:34:53,660 --> 01:34:56,151
That's hard for
an intelligent man to handle.

1114
01:34:56,288 --> 01:35:00,332
- Didn't you say you learnt to live with it?
- I lied.

1115
01:35:00,458 --> 01:35:02,949
Oh, you lied!

1116
01:35:03,169 --> 01:35:08,412
- So now you gotta prove it to yourself?
- No TV, no newspapers. Just you and me.

1117
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:11,586
Nothin'. Just you and me.
Age before beauty.

1118
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:14,923
- Anything you say.
- I'll do all the work, OK?

1119
01:35:15,056 --> 01:35:19,184
You better go slow cos you ain't
as young as springtime any more.

1120
01:35:19,311 --> 01:35:21,884
I'm still young enough to whip your butt.

1121
01:35:22,022 --> 01:35:25,521
Yeah? How you gonna do that?
You taught me everything you know.

1122
01:35:25,859 --> 01:35:31,233
Almost everything. You gotta remember,
you fight great, but I'm a great fighter.

1123
01:35:31,364 --> 01:35:34,069
- You ready?
- Absolutely.

1124
01:35:35,285 --> 01:35:38,784
You know, Stallion,
it's too bad we gotta get old.

1125
01:35:40,557 --> 01:35:42,596
Ah, just keep punchin', Apollo.

1126
01:35:44,769 --> 01:35:46,809
You wanna ring the bell?

1127
01:35:46,938 --> 01:35:48,136
All right.

1128
01:35:48,273 --> 01:35:50,312
Ding-ding.

1129
01:35:51,443 --> 01:35:53,482
Come on, Stallion.

1130
01:35:53,987 --> 01:35:55,861
Come on, come on.

1131
01:35:56,489 --> 01:35:59,027
Boy, you really move good
for an older guy.

1132
01:36:00,577 --> 01:36:03,282
You're lookin' good. I taught you well.

1133
01:36:03,872 --> 01:36:07,075
I think you taught me too good.
Look at him fly.

1134
01:36:07,208 --> 01:36:10,542
Look out now. No, no, you don't
want any of this. Come on.

1135
01:36:11,963 --> 01:36:15,964
- Maybe I'm in here with the wrong guy.
