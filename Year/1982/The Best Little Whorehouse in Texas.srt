} Don't let your mouth
overload your capabilities

165
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,797
} And we can get along

166
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:16,759
Well, howdy, boys. It's good to see you.
Nice to meet you.

167
00:11:16,888 --> 00:11:20,198
Come on over here.
I'd like you to meet my girls.

168
00:11:20,648 --> 00:11:27,838
} It's just a little-bitty
pissant country place

169
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:31,161
} Nothin' much to see

170
00:11:31,728 --> 00:11:35,960
} No drinkin' allowed,
we get a nice quiet crowd

171
00:11:36,368 --> 00:11:38,518
} Plain as it can be

172
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:43,517
} It's just a piddly, squattin'
old-time country place

173
00:11:44,209 --> 00:11:46,279
} Nothin' too high-toned

174
00:11:46,409 --> 00:11:49,162
} Just lots of goodwill
and maybe one small thrill

175
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:51,120
} But there's nothin' dirty goin' on

176
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:54,400
} It's just a little-bitty
pissant country place

177
00:11:54,529 --> 00:11:56,087
} Nothin' much to see

178
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:58,723
} No drinkin' allowed,
we get a nice quiet crowd

179
00:11:58,849 --> 00:12:00,282
} Plain as it can be

180
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:03,526
} It's just a piddly, squattin'
old-time country place

181
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:05,321
} Nothin' too high-toned

182
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:07,519
} Just lots of goodwill
and maybe one small thrill

183
00:12:07,729 --> 00:12:09,799
} Just lots of goodwill
and maybe one small thrill

184
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:12,204
} Just lots of goodwill
and maybe one small thrill

185
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:14,241
} But there's nothin' dirty goin' on

186
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,199
- } Nothin' dirty goin' on
- Yeah!

187
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,606
<i>(crows)</i>

188
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:27,679
<i>Well, everything was goin' along fine,
just like always,...</i>

189
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,961
<i>...until that famous college
football celebration.</i>

190
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,445
<i>Some think that's when
the trouble started.</i>

191
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,126
For years, the winning seniors...

192
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,925
...of the Texas Aggie/Texas U
football game at Thanksgiving...

193
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,804
...were treated to a night out
at the Chicken Ranch...

194
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:45,047
...by their alumni association.

195
00:12:45,171 --> 00:12:49,210
But, actually, the real trouble started
brewin' about three days before.

196
00:12:57,811 --> 00:13:00,609
I can't tell you how thrilled we are
with your contribution.

197
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:02,767
- Here's your receipt.
- Thank you, Rita.

198
00:13:02,891 --> 00:13:05,644
Those kids'll be so excited,
and the mayor too.

199
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:08,444
The council will probably
vote you another plaque.

200
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:11,369
Lord, I hope not.
I got a closet full of 'em now!

201
00:13:12,212 --> 00:13:14,646
Hello, Dulcie Mae. You know Miss Mona.

202
00:13:15,332 --> 00:13:18,369
Oh, yes, of course! We've met.
Mornin'.

203
00:13:18,492 --> 00:13:20,608
- Good mornin'.
- Isn't this wonderful?

204
00:13:20,732 --> 00:13:24,691
Miss Mona has just capped the goal
for the Little League fund campaign.

205
00:13:24,812 --> 00:13:27,280
Oh, how nice!

206
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:31,087
Well, on behalf of my son and
his team-mates, I wanna thank you.

207
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:35,046
You tell 'em I'll be well repaid when
they take the championship next year.

208
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:37,811
- Goodbye, Rita.
- I'm sorry the sheriff wasn't here.

209
00:13:37,932 --> 00:13:40,492
He went to Meritsville.
He'll be gone all afternoon.

210
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:42,604
Well, you tell him I said hi.

211
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,644
- Bye.
- Bye.

212
00:13:44,773 --> 00:13:46,252
Bye.

213
00:13:56,173 --> 00:13:58,767
- Hey, Miss Mona.
- How are you doin', Deputy Fred?

214
00:13:58,893 --> 00:14:02,602
- It's nice to see you.
- Keepin' an eye on my place at night?

215
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:05,372
The sheriff's real particular
about security there.

216
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:07,802
Well, one of these nights,
you drop in.

217
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:11,164
My girls would love to show you
a little appreciation.

218
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:13,762
Shoot, Miss Mona!
You know I'm a married man.

219
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,806
Fred, you think the cows
don't appreciate the time off...

220
00:14:16,934 --> 00:14:19,653
...when a bull goes over
to another pasture?

221
00:14:19,774 --> 00:14:21,730
Miss Mona!

222
00:14:22,414 --> 00:14:25,804
- See you later, Miss Mona.
- OK. Goodbye.

223
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,444
- Damn it!
- What's the matter?

224
00:15:13,576 --> 00:15:15,612
- You're in bed already.
- So?

225
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:19,775
So I told you a hundred times - watching
you get undressed is the best part.

226
00:15:19,896 --> 00:15:21,693
<i>The best part?</i>

227
00:15:21,816 --> 00:15:25,047
Well, maybe not the best part,
but in the top two.

228
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:29,886
Now, would I wanna disappoint
my little honey?

229
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:33,528
Whoo!

230
00:15:34,096 --> 00:15:36,246
- I'm glad I was late.
- Me too!

231
00:15:36,377 --> 00:15:39,369
You just hold your horses.
I got a surprise for you.

232
00:15:39,497 --> 00:15:44,093
I went by the post office. I picked up
a package from Frederick's of Hollywood.

233
00:15:44,217 --> 00:15:46,777
Just a little something sexy
I thought you'd like.

234
00:15:46,897 --> 00:15:49,252
Little? It don't look little to me.

235
00:15:49,377 --> 00:15:52,369
Well, it ain't a trainin' bra,
but I believe I can fill it out.

236
00:15:52,497 --> 00:15:56,251
- I don't think you got any problem there.
- I'll be back with more.

237
00:15:56,377 --> 00:16:01,292
<i>(chuckles) You know, Mona,
I've known a lot of women in my life.</i>

238
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:04,056
None of 'em have ever been
exciting to me like you are.

239
00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:07,772
Really? Even after all these years
we've been meetin' like this?

240
00:16:07,898 --> 00:16:10,253
I'll tell you something.

241
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:16,297
A year with you is like...
a minute of sheer happiness.

242
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:21,409
Well, now, that is just about the sweetest
thing anybody ever said to me.

243
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:23,768
I know.

244
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:25,889
You know, honey...

245
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,896
...you bring out the... romantic in me.

246
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:36,533
Ta-da!

247
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:40,175
Whoo! You did that real fast.

248
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,132
I've had a lot of practice
gettin' in and out of my clothes.

249
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,409
How do you like the outfit?

250
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:49,774
Hot damn. Makes me feel real sexy!

251
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:53,015
Whoo!

252
00:16:56,979 --> 00:16:59,049
Well, you don't look real sexy.

253
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:01,329
- I look like I always look.
- That's just it.

254
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:05,008
It's them damn droopy boxer drawers.
I just hate the looks of them.

255
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,337
- I've worn boxer shorts for years!
- And they look like it.

256
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,499
These are a brand-new pair.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

257
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,771
People tell me I have
a real sexy quality about me.

258
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,130
Well, you do,
but them boxer shorts don't.

259
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:21,730
But when I was gettin' me some
sexy things, I thought about you.

260
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,896
They have a his-and-hers department...

261
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,932
...and I thought you might
wanna try that on for size.

262
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,653
What the hell is it? A Japanese slingshot?

263
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,659
No, it's Jockey shorts
with little silver snaps on the side.

264
00:17:34,781 --> 00:17:38,410
Mm. "Little" is the key word here.
They are real little.

265
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:42,454
A guy could hurt himself wearin' those.
I don't think so, thank you very much.

266
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:46,972
Ed Earl, I paid $20 for these, plus
postage, and I want you to wear 'em.

267
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:50,016
- You paid $20 for these?
- Yes!

268
00:17:50,141 --> 00:17:52,530
Well, you got screwed.

269
00:17:52,901 --> 00:17:56,018
- Come on, Ed Earl!
- No!

270
00:17:56,141 --> 00:18:00,498
If they look half as good as I think,
you ain't gonna wear 'em but a second.

271
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,577
Maybe less.

272
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:05,571
- They're ridiculous.
- They're sexy.

273
00:18:05,702 --> 00:18:07,374
No, no, no!

274
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:10,141
Well, fine! I'm gettin' dressed
and goin' home.

275
00:18:10,262 --> 00:18:14,016
Well, fine! I'm goin' in the bathroom
and... put these on.

276
00:18:18,382 --> 00:18:21,374
Be like puttin' two bowlin' balls
in a marble bag.

277
00:18:21,942 --> 00:18:24,137
Braggin', braggin', braggin'.

278
00:18:27,622 --> 00:18:31,535
- Well, I saw Dulcie Mae in town today.
- Oh, yeah?

279
00:18:31,662 --> 00:18:34,620
I guess you'll be goin' there
for Thanksgivin' dinner.

280
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:38,418
- Don't I always?
- You better check that turkey of hers...

281
00:18:38,543 --> 00:18:42,661
...because there's a hook in there that's
gonna drag your ass to a weddin' chapel.

282
00:18:42,783 --> 00:18:44,933
<i>(chuckles) No way.</i>

283
00:18:48,103 --> 00:18:51,493
I don't believe in matrimony.
It screws up a relationship.

284
00:18:51,623 --> 00:18:53,853
Amen to that, Ed Earl.

285
00:18:54,943 --> 00:18:58,140
- Ready?
- Oh, I'm always ready.

286
00:19:03,344 --> 00:19:06,097
Well, hellfire! Is that it?

287
00:19:06,224 --> 00:19:10,137
- How'd you like it?
- I didn't hardly get to even see them!

288
00:19:10,264 --> 00:19:13,142
That's all you're gonna see,
cos I ain't parading around.

289
00:19:13,264 --> 00:19:14,982
- Oh, come on, Ed Earl.
- No!

290
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:17,413
- For me.
- No.

291
00:19:17,544 --> 00:19:20,183
- One itsy-bitsy peek?
- What are you doin'?

292
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:25,342
Now, that's what
the little silver snaps are for.

293
00:19:26,784 --> 00:19:29,821
- Work, don't they?
- Just like a snap.

294
00:19:30,784 --> 00:19:33,776
Come on over here
and give me a little lip-lock.

295
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:37,301
Oop. Gotta brush my teeth.

296
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,700
You know how I am about my breath.

297
00:19:45,945 --> 00:19:50,302
Oh, Ed Earl, I like a lot of things, but
these afternoons with you top the list.

298
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,934
Yeah? Well, sing it to me, honey.

299
00:19:55,105 --> 00:19:57,061
} I like fancy, frilly things

300
00:19:57,465 --> 00:19:59,615
} High-heeled shoes and diamond rings

301
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:01,815
} Ragtime bands and Western swing

302
00:20:01,946 --> 00:20:03,902
} And sneakin' around with you

303
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:06,577
} Well, I like beer and rodeos

304
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:08,822
} Detective books and dominoes

305
00:20:08,946 --> 00:20:12,780
} Football games and Cheerios
and sneakin' around with you

306
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:15,341
} Sneakin' around with you

307
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:17,696
} Goin' a round or two

308
00:20:17,826 --> 00:20:19,976
} Doin' what lovers do

309
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,895
} Whenever they're sneakin' around

310
00:20:23,026 --> 00:20:24,982
} I like lots of cash on hand

311
00:20:25,106 --> 00:20:27,495
} And dirty jokes
about the Fuller Brush Man

312
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:31,096
} I like stuff I understand
like sneakin' around with you

313
00:20:31,787 --> 00:20:34,096
} You know, I like a thrill
that has no strings

314
00:20:34,227 --> 00:20:36,138
} Friendship that don't ever change

315
00:20:36,267 --> 00:20:38,383
} And laughter from the joy of things

316
00:20:38,507 --> 00:20:40,304
} And sneakin' around with you

317
00:20:40,427 --> 00:20:42,543
} Sneakin' around with you

318
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,862
} Goin' a round or two

319
00:20:44,987 --> 00:20:47,137
} Doin' what lovers do

320
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:49,982
} Whenever they're sneakin' around

321
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:02,778
} I like drive-in picture shows

322
00:21:02,908 --> 00:21:05,024
} Kissin' long and lovin' slow

323
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:08,823
} The secret places lovers go
whenever they're sneakin' around

324
00:21:08,948 --> 00:21:11,621
Whoo!
} I like the crazy things we try

325
00:21:11,748 --> 00:21:13,898
} And the sexy things we fantasise

326
00:21:14,028 --> 00:21:16,098
} Just a-makin' out
in the broad daylight

337
00:21:40,589 --> 00:21:42,545
} Sneakin'!

338
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:47,902
Sheriff?

339
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:50,305
Sheriff!

340
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:54,944
<i>- Deputy Fred.
- (Mona) Fred.</i>

341
00:21:58,710 --> 00:22:00,382
Oh...

342
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,466
Hold that position.

343
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,228
Don't move. Be right back.

344
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,670
- This better be important.
- Well, I think it is.

345
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,623
I saw your car and I figured
your phone was out, because...

346
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,706
What are you wearin' that for?

347
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:26,821
- Takin' a shower.
- Oh, really?

348
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,147
<i>I take my shower in the mornin'.
I read in the Reader's Digest...</i>

349
00:22:30,271 --> 00:22:33,581
I don't care! What do you want?

350
00:22:33,711 --> 00:22:37,624
The mayor wants to speak to you. Rita's
been callin' all over the county for you.

351
00:22:37,751 --> 00:22:40,311
- He wants a meeting right away.
- Can't it wait?

352
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:43,104
- You mean till after your shower?
- Mm...

353
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:46,507
You go to your radio.
Tell him I'll be there when I get there.

354
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:49,384
Nothing can be that important
that it can't wait.

355
00:22:49,511 --> 00:22:51,308
Right, Sheriff.

356
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:53,581
Nice man, but dumb.

357
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:03,109
<i>Mona? (laughs)</i>

358
00:23:03,952 --> 00:23:05,908
Mona?

359
00:23:12,632 --> 00:23:14,588
<i>(car starts)</i>

360
00:23:40,713 --> 00:23:44,228
Ain't that funny? Miss Mona was
at the back, knockin' on the screen door.

361
00:23:44,353 --> 00:23:47,663
She was in a hurry,
but just dropped by to give you this.

362
00:23:51,153 --> 00:23:53,542
It's a Japanese slingshot.

363
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,468
Well, look at that! At last!

364
00:23:58,594 --> 00:24:00,585
OK, Rufus. What's on your mind?

365
00:24:00,714 --> 00:24:05,151
Something with serious implications
to the health of this town! Tell him, CJ!

366
00:24:05,274 --> 00:24:08,550
I have this friend that works
in a TV station down in Houston.

367
00:24:08,674 --> 00:24:13,668
He tipped me off that Melvin P Thorpe's
plannin' an exposé on the Chicken Ranch.

368
00:24:13,794 --> 00:24:15,944
- Who?
- Melvin P Thorpe.

369
00:24:16,074 --> 00:24:19,908
He's that crazy consumer advocate.
Has a report on the late night news.

370
00:24:20,034 --> 00:24:24,710
<i>He's got a new show once a week:
The Watchdog Report. It's on tonight.</i>

371
00:24:24,834 --> 00:24:28,031
The Chicken Ranch on TV.
Now, come on, fellas.

372
00:24:29,275 --> 00:24:32,233
- Television is a family medium.
- But he's a sensationalist.

373
00:24:32,355 --> 00:24:37,065
He shows up every time a consumer has
a complaint. He's a menace to business.

374
00:24:37,515 --> 00:24:41,747
He's that fella that put the peanuts
back in the chocolate bar.

375
00:24:41,875 --> 00:24:42,625
What?

376
00:24:42,755 --> 00:24:45,667
He made the makers of
the Peanut Delight candy bar admit...

377
00:24:45,795 --> 00:24:50,505
...that they put less peanuts in than
they said. He made 'em change their ways.

378
00:24:50,635 --> 00:24:53,593
- Sounds like a tough customer.
- He has a lot of influence.

379
00:24:53,715 --> 00:24:55,910
If he brings cameras
to the Chicken Ranch...

380
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:59,153
Come on, Rufus!
I'll make some phone calls.

381
00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:03,388
I got a little influence
around this state myself.

382
00:25:06,236 --> 00:25:08,909
Well, it's no use talkin' to me
about it, Sheriff.

383
00:25:09,036 --> 00:25:12,346
Melvin P Thorpe is now the biggest
attraction at this station.

384
00:25:12,476 --> 00:25:16,435
High ratings. Lots of letters.
He doesn't listen to anybody.

385
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:21,154
Hell, he wants to go national! Wants
to be watchdog for the whole US of A.

386
00:25:21,396 --> 00:25:25,150
Love to help, but just like you don't
wanna mess with the Chicken Ranch...

387
00:25:25,277 --> 00:25:27,666
...I don't wanna ruffle
this old bird's feathers.

388
00:25:27,797 --> 00:25:30,869
Here in Houston, he's becomin'
a regular Texas attraction.

389
00:25:31,037 --> 00:25:32,914
Now, wait a minute, Ed Earl.

390
00:25:33,037 --> 00:25:36,791
I'd tread easy on this one.
Them TV boys can be mighty powerful.

391
00:25:36,917 --> 00:25:39,351
And mighty useful, if you get my meaning.

392
00:25:39,477 --> 00:25:41,433
Senator, roll call.

393
00:25:41,557 --> 00:25:45,345
Excuse me, Ed Earl. I gotta go.
It's that damn bilingual bullshit again.

394
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:49,948
Let me give you a word of advice
from one elected official to another.

395
00:25:50,077 --> 00:25:52,432
Be careful of the box.

396
00:25:55,838 --> 00:26:00,548
What the hell's goin' on? This goddamn
Thorpe's got the whole state bamboozled.

397
00:26:00,678 --> 00:26:03,272
This is serious, Ed Earl.
You gotta do somethin'.

398
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:05,548
I intend to.

399
00:26:05,678 --> 00:26:08,750
Deputy Fred, I want you to
hold down the fort for a while.

400
00:26:08,878 --> 00:26:10,106
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

401
00:26:10,238 --> 00:26:12,149
- Where you goin'?
- To Houston.

402
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:15,588
I'm gonna take care of that
little peckerwood myself.

403
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,275
- This is it.
- Thank you.

404
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,797
Come in.

405
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,587
- Mr Thorpe?
- I know you.

406
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:48,470
- You do?
- Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd.

407
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:50,954
They told me you were here. Come on in.

408
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,795
I hope I'm not... interruptin' anything.

409
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:59,629
Oh, please! It's my pleasure, my honour.
What brings you to Houston?

410
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,513
Sit down. Anywhere over here.

411
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,551
I'm gettin' dressed. Sit down.

412
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,389
I've got my TV show to do,
and I'm runnin' a bit behind time.

413
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,273
It's your show I want to talk to you about,
Mr Thorpe.

414
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,038
- Melvin.
- Melvin.

415
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,390
- Please. You watch the show, Ed?
- Well...

416
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,830
Last week was the best ratin' we ever had.

417
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,430
The city planning commissioner
was drivin' a city car...

418
00:27:22,561 --> 00:27:24,711
Hold that for me, will you?

419
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:27,833
...while he was on vacation.
Caught him dead to rights.

420
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:30,395
That pitiful putz.
Would you just pull that up?

421
00:27:30,521 --> 00:27:32,477
Just pull that up.

422
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:37,640
And we broke a 30 share. It's affectin'
my pieces on the late night news.

423
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:40,992
Up, up, up.
They just love my little report.

424
00:27:42,881 --> 00:27:46,271
- I hear you're very popular.
- The power of television...

425
00:27:46,401 --> 00:27:49,757
...of public exposure,
is so great it scares me.

426
00:27:49,881 --> 00:27:54,272
I swear, I could get the mayor's
own children to throw rocks at him.

427
00:27:54,402 --> 00:27:56,870
Which show did you like best, Ed?

428
00:27:57,722 --> 00:28:01,192
I think the one about
the... nuts in the chocolate bar.

429
00:28:01,322 --> 00:28:03,278
That's one of my favourites.

430
00:28:03,402 --> 00:28:06,360
Threescore means 60, like the Bible says.

431
00:28:06,482 --> 00:28:09,201
So if it says "60 nuts" on the wrapper...

432
00:28:09,322 --> 00:28:12,394
...I wanna see 60 nuts inside.

433
00:28:12,522 --> 00:28:15,320
And I'm talkin' full nuts.
I'm not talkin' a half-nut...

434
00:28:15,442 --> 00:28:17,797
...or nut bits or nut chips.

435
00:28:19,242 --> 00:28:21,597
I'm talkin' a full nut.

436
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,482
I can see that.

437
00:28:26,603 --> 00:28:29,071
Thank God we still live in a society...

438
00:28:29,203 --> 00:28:33,799
...where anything that's phoney or
dishonest can't stand the light of day.

439
00:28:34,643 --> 00:28:36,952
- Sock.
- Beg your pardon?

440
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,119
Sock. Thank you.

441
00:28:39,243 --> 00:28:40,722
Yeah...

442
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:44,792
Most corporations
involved in false advertisin'...

443
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,914
...would just laugh at a $50 fine.

444
00:28:47,043 --> 00:28:52,071
But you show up with your TV camera
and give them a little bad publicity...

445
00:28:52,204 --> 00:28:56,243
...and they shape up faster than
goose shit slides through a tin horn.

446
00:28:56,364 --> 00:28:58,275
<i>(laughs)</i>

447
00:28:58,564 --> 00:29:00,714
<i>(hums)</i>

448
00:29:00,844 --> 00:29:05,235
Melvin, it's that bad publicity I want to
talk to you about. That could hurt people.

449
00:29:05,364 --> 00:29:08,322
You take that report you're doin'
on the Chicken Ranch.

450
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:10,639
That place is older than rocks and water.

451
00:29:10,764 --> 00:29:13,358
I expect your granddaddy
took your daddy there...

452
00:29:13,484 --> 00:29:17,113
<i>...to learn about the birds and the bees.
- (chuckles)</i>

453
00:29:17,244 --> 00:29:21,442
I'm from New Jersey. See, I moved
to Houston six years ago.

454
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:22,520
<i>(chuckles)</i>

455
00:29:22,645 --> 00:29:24,795
Texas suits my style.

456
00:29:25,845 --> 00:29:32,239
Every schoolboy in the state knows about
it. Most of the politicians have slept there.

457
00:29:32,365 --> 00:29:36,153
The mayor and the people of my county
want to keep things just the way they are.

458
00:29:36,285 --> 00:29:40,164
Hm. You know somethin', Sheriff.
It just struck me.

459
00:29:40,285 --> 00:29:43,197
- We are in the same profession.
- What's that?

460
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:47,716
Law enforcement. I'm out there fightin'
for the rights of the public, just like you.

461
00:29:47,845 --> 00:29:50,200
Both of us are trying to protect the public.

462
00:29:50,326 --> 00:29:53,523
You in the old way and me in the new.

463
00:29:54,486 --> 00:29:56,716
<i>- The new?
- (chuckles) Television.</i>

464
00:29:57,606 --> 00:29:59,676
I'm the electronic bounty hunter.

465
00:29:59,806 --> 00:30:01,762
I use a camera. You use a gun.

466
00:30:02,406 --> 00:30:06,763
Yeah. Melvin, everybody'd be happy
if you'd just drop the whole thing.

467
00:30:07,566 --> 00:30:12,356
I mean, those ladies out there,
they perform a necessary function.

468
00:30:12,486 --> 00:30:15,398
- Right or wrong...
- Right or wrong don't interest me!

469
00:30:15,526 --> 00:30:18,598
I'm no moraliser.
I leave all that to the preacher.

470
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:24,243
I'm glad. The mayor was thinkin' maybe
you'd want a little unnecessary publicity.

471
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:28,201
<i>(laughs) Unnecessary publicity?
Well, he's got me all wrong!</i>

472
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:31,763
I'm not one of those sensation-mongers
out to boost his own ego!

473
00:30:31,887 --> 00:30:33,320
Clear.

474
00:30:34,047 --> 00:30:36,766
- How do you like it?
- It's different.

475
00:30:36,887 --> 00:30:38,843
I designed this myself.

476
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:43,565
No, you tell your mayor he's got
nothing to fear from me on that score.

477
00:30:44,647 --> 00:30:48,765
- He'll be happy to hear that.
- I'm a lawman. That's my interest. Right?

00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:49,843
<i>(knocking)</i>

479

00:30:52,288 --> 00:30:54,438

Nonsense! You're what
the public wants to see.

485
00:31:08,688 --> 00:31:11,998
We'll discuss it after the show.
I want you to be my guest.

The proprietor of this innocent-lookin'
ranch house is known only as Miss Mona.

505
00:32:21,571 --> 00:32:26,281
And the man who turns his back
on her illegal operation...

506
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:29,164
...is Sheriff Ed Earl Dodd!

507
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:32,284
Did I say "illegal"? Yes, I did!

as delicate as I can!

That's typical of them crusadin' fanatics.

They're always confusin' crime with sin.

00:41:15,749 --> 00:41:19,378
...or I'll whip your butt so bad
it'll look like the stripes on a barber pole.

650
00:41:19,509 --> 00:41:22,069
<i>- (boy) Get him, Sheriff.
- May be mean, but he's ours!</i>

651
00:41:22,189 --> 00:41:23,304
Number three.

652
00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:27,945
No sawed-off little pecker is gonna
accuse me of takin' a bribe and live...

653
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,378
...cos I wear the badge
in this goddamn county.

654
00:41:30,509 --> 00:41:34,104
So you listen and listen good,
you over-padded, televising turd!

655
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:38,382
If I ever see you or any of those bastards
that work for you in my town again...

656
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:42,947
...I'm gonna knock you so flat
you'll have to roll down your socks to shit!

657
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:46,469
- That's tellin' him, Sheriff!
- My goodness!

658
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:50,902
So get outta here, you goddamn
wig-wearin', citified son of a bitch!

659
00:42:06,271 --> 00:42:08,227
Move, you schmuck!

660
00:42:10,151 --> 00:42:12,142
Move it! Come on!

661
00:42:12,271 --> 00:42:14,307
Get outta here!

662
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:17,707
Move this thing!
Come on, move this thing!

663
00:42:17,831 --> 00:42:22,143
I'll get you for this. You son of a bitch!
You'll pay for this.

664
00:42:22,271 --> 00:42:25,422
You're in trouble, Sheriff!
You're in big trouble!

665
00:42:26,871 --> 00:42:28,463
So long, partner.

666
00:42:30,591 --> 00:42:32,547
<i>(applause)</i>

667
00:42:54,112 --> 00:42:57,502
Boy, you sent him hightailin'.
I was so proud of you!

668
00:42:57,632 --> 00:42:59,588
- Didn't I?
- Yeah.

669
00:43:04,113 --> 00:43:06,468
- Look at them stars.
- Mm.

670
00:43:07,513 --> 00:43:10,266
There ain't nothin'
prettier than a Texas sky.

671
00:43:10,393 --> 00:43:12,463
Ain't that the truth.

672
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:17,824
- Hey! Did you see that shootin' star?
- Mm-hm.

673
00:43:17,953 --> 00:43:20,228
- That could've been a spaceship.
- Yeah.

674
00:43:20,353 --> 00:43:22,913
- You believe in spaceships?
- Sure.

675
00:43:23,033 --> 00:43:28,471
I saw a picture once. Them fellas
that's supposed to be from up there.

676
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:34,067
Tiny little fellas, bald-headed.
Little feet, little hands, got no peckers.

677
00:43:34,794 --> 00:43:36,944
Got no peckers?

678
00:43:37,634 --> 00:43:39,989
Well, I ain't interested.

679
00:43:41,194 --> 00:43:43,549
I don't think my girls would be either.

680
00:43:44,714 --> 00:43:47,592
When I was little,
I used to imagine a flyin' saucer...

681
00:43:47,714 --> 00:43:51,423
...swoopin' down and pickin' me up
and takin' me off to heaven.

682
00:43:51,554 --> 00:43:53,749
- Like the angels.
- Mm-hm.

683
00:43:54,634 --> 00:43:57,626
"I looked, and behold, a whirlwind
comin' out of the north."

684
00:43:57,754 --> 00:44:02,032
"And out of the midst of the fire came
the likeness of four living creatures."

685
00:44:02,155 --> 00:44:03,554
What you talkin' about?

686
00:44:03,675 --> 00:44:06,951
That's what the Bible says
about spaceships in Ezekiel.

687
00:44:07,075 --> 00:44:09,464
- Don't you know nothin' about the Bible?
- Yeah!

688
00:44:09,595 --> 00:44:12,428
I just don't know nothin'
about no Zekiel in the Bible.

689
00:44:12,555 --> 00:44:15,945
I knew a Zekiel Peebles
once in the eighth grade.

690
00:44:17,195 --> 00:44:19,151
Think I busted his jaw.

691
00:44:20,275 --> 00:44:25,429
- Well, that was very christian of you.
- Well, most of my family was Baptist.

692
00:44:25,555 --> 00:44:29,514
I never stayed with one family long
enough to become anything in particular.

693
00:44:29,636 --> 00:44:32,230
But I read the Bible.
I believe in Jesus.

694
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,908
I think Jesus was a...
was a real good man.

695
00:44:36,716 --> 00:44:38,866
And he was a heck of a speaker.

696
00:44:38,996 --> 00:44:42,625
Yep. I knew a woman once
that had a vision of Jesus.

697
00:44:42,756 --> 00:44:46,146
He came right into her house,
set right down at the foot of her bed.

698
00:44:46,276 --> 00:44:47,550
Mm?

699
00:44:47,676 --> 00:44:49,906
I don't know what I'd do
if that happened to me.

700
00:44:50,036 --> 00:44:55,235
I'll tell you something. If Jesus comes to
your house, all hell's gonna break loose.

701
00:44:56,916 --> 00:44:58,872
You got a point there, Ed Earl.

702
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:02,353
But Jesus was really good to
Mary Magdalene, the fallen woman.

703
00:45:02,477 --> 00:45:04,752
He was always bein' very sociable.

704
00:45:04,877 --> 00:45:08,631
He went to this big weddin' once,
and they ran out of wine.

705
00:45:08,757 --> 00:45:11,510
You know what he did?
Turned the water into wine.

706
00:45:11,637 --> 00:45:14,515
Well, that's a man that knows
how to throw a party.

707
00:45:14,637 --> 00:45:16,628
Now, don't be sacrilegious.

708
00:45:16,957 --> 00:45:20,313
I'm not. I'm not.
He forgives me.

709
00:45:21,157 --> 00:45:23,910
- He knows I was kiddin'.
- I know he forgives you.

710
00:45:24,037 --> 00:45:27,473
That's funny, how God can forgive you
and people can't.

711
00:45:27,597 --> 00:45:32,625
- Now, why is that?
- Well, because people are not very godly.

712
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:36,632
I know. I know.

713
00:45:38,678 --> 00:45:40,634
Yeah.

714
00:45:50,558 --> 00:45:52,514
<i>(chuckles)</i>

715
00:45:53,798 --> 00:45:55,754
What is it?

716
00:45:57,038 --> 00:46:01,316
Melvin P Thorpe is a sorry son of a bitch.

717
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:10,196
You reckon he's gonna
run for the legislature?

718
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,275
Why?

719
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:16,075
I never told anybody this, Mona.

720
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:22,155
I was thinkin' of runnin'
for the legislature someday.

721
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,077
- Are you serious, Ed Earl?
- Yeah.

722
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:29,634
They say an honest man can't be
elected in this country any more.

723
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,354
But I don't believe that.

724
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,199
This is a good country.

725
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,197
I believe I could win.

726
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,198
Well, you got my vote.
I might even go register.

727
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,277
Boy, I sure didn't know
you had dreams that big.

728
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,073
- People really do like you, though.
- They like you too.

729
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,872
- Really?
- Sure.

730
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,072
You ask anybody in town.
Say "How do you like Miss Mona?"

731
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,714
They say "Shoot, she's a fine woman."

732
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,035
"Fine, friendly and nice."

733
00:46:58,561 --> 00:47:01,871
I always just thought
if you see somebody without a smile...

734
00:47:02,001 --> 00:47:04,276
...give 'em yours.
- I like that.

735
00:47:05,921 --> 00:47:08,196
I like that.

736
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:10,881
Think I'll use that as my campaign slogan.

737
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:14,672
"If you see somebody without a smile,
give 'em yours."

738
00:47:14,921 --> 00:47:16,877
I'll have that printed up on a card.

739
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:19,561
Oh, you're kiddin' me, you smart ass.

740
00:47:20,561 --> 00:47:22,836
I had a dream once.

741
00:47:22,961 --> 00:47:24,110
Yeah?

742
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:27,278
- I'll tell you if you won't laugh.
- Oh, I won't laugh.

743
00:47:27,402 --> 00:47:30,360
Well, I used to dream
of bein' a ballerina.

744
00:47:31,762 --> 00:47:33,161
<i>(sniggers)</i>

745
00:47:33,282 --> 00:47:35,477
Now, Ed Earl, I ain't tellin' you nothin'.

746
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:39,117
- Well... A ballerina?
- Yes, a ballerina!

747
00:47:39,242 --> 00:47:41,198
<i>(chuckles)</i>

748
00:47:41,842 --> 00:47:46,393
Well, I think that's wonderful. You still
could be a ballerina if you wanted to be.

749
00:47:46,522 --> 00:47:48,638
- Don't be ridiculous!
- No, you could!

750
00:47:48,762 --> 00:47:51,151
Go into training.
Just start jumpin' up and down.

751
00:47:51,282 --> 00:47:54,160
Me? Jumpin' up and down?
I'd black both my eyes.

752
00:47:55,203 --> 00:47:57,159
I couldn't now. I'm too top-heavy.

753
00:47:57,283 --> 00:48:02,232
I have a hard enough time balancin' these
things now, without gettin' on my toes.

754
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,271
- You know somethin'?
- What?

755
00:48:11,403 --> 00:48:15,078
You know that, uh... I don't see
anybody but you any more.

756
00:48:16,163 --> 00:48:18,916
Course, you can't say the same, can you?

757
00:48:22,043 --> 00:48:26,673
I haven't been to bed with another woman
besides you in three years.

758
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:28,954
You didn't know that, did you?

759
00:48:29,764 --> 00:48:31,914
No, I didn't know that.

760
00:48:33,924 --> 00:48:36,757
Nothin' better, once you've had the best.

761
00:48:36,884 --> 00:48:39,398
- Hey, I like that.
- I thought you would.

762
00:48:39,524 --> 00:48:43,722
Reckon if I was to run for the legislature
I could put that on my card?

763
00:48:59,205 --> 00:49:03,403
Up next, Melvin P Thorpe continues
his exposé of the Chicken Ranch...

764
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:06,597
<i>...with a violent demonstration
in the Gilbert town square.</i>

765
00:49:06,725 --> 00:49:08,875
Great God from Goldsborough!

766
00:49:11,325 --> 00:49:13,281
<i>(phone rings)</i>

767
00:49:15,005 --> 00:49:17,314
Yeah?

768
00:49:17,805 --> 00:49:20,160
Ed Earl, you better turn on channel four.

769
00:49:20,845 --> 00:49:23,678
<i>That Melvin P Thorpe idiot's
got you on TV again.</i>

770
00:49:23,806 --> 00:49:25,842
Well, I don't give a shit, Rufus!

771
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:28,605
<i>It's all very well to take
that attitude, Ed Earl...</i>

772
00:49:28,726 --> 00:49:30,398
Honey...

773
00:49:30,526 --> 00:49:33,802
Put on the television there. Channel four.

774
00:49:33,926 --> 00:49:37,714
That Melvin P Thorpe is
shootin' off his mouth again.

775
00:49:37,846 --> 00:49:40,235
What could be so goddamn important?

776
00:49:40,366 --> 00:49:44,518
Calm down, Rufus!
It can't be as bad as all that.

777
00:49:45,046 --> 00:49:48,721
<i>What happened to me as an individual
is not important.</i>

778
00:49:48,846 --> 00:49:52,077
<i>Is this the kind of man we want
runnin' our law enforcement?</i>

779
00:49:52,206 --> 00:49:57,758
<i>Is this the kind of foul-mouthed example
we wanna set for our innocent children?</i>

780
00:49:57,887 --> 00:49:59,036
<i>Run the film.</i>

781
00:49:59,167 --> 00:50:00,520
<i>Number three.</i>

<i>No sawed-off little (bleep) is gonna

<i>(gunshot)</i>

790
00:50:29,728 --> 00:50:33,767
I've had calls from preachers, deacons
and the presidents of two garden clubs!

791
00:50:33,888 --> 00:50:35,116
Thank you for callin'.

792
00:50:35,248 --> 00:50:38,558
The phones have been ringin' all mornin'.
Sheriff's office.

793
00:50:38,688 --> 00:50:43,239
I don't know why I serve as mayor
of this incorporated sand trap anyway!

794
00:50:43,768 --> 00:50:46,919
- What in the heck is keepin' him?
- He'll be along.

795
00:50:47,048 --> 00:50:50,836
- Well, he'd better!
- My wife couldn't believe what she saw.

796
00:50:50,968 --> 00:50:55,917
They bleeped him, but she read his lips
on every "hell", "goddamn" and "shit".

797
00:50:57,609 --> 00:51:01,397
<i>There's some folks gettin' up a petition
to close the Chicken Ranch.</i>

798
00:51:01,529 --> 00:51:04,168
All we wanted to do was keep it quiet.

799
00:51:04,289 --> 00:51:08,362
<i>Now, thanks to Ed Earl, it's the hottest
thing on the air since the Gong Show.</i>

800
00:51:08,489 --> 00:51:10,684
I'll tell him you called.
Mornin', Sheriff.

801
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:12,640
- Mornin', Rita.
- Here's your calls.

802
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:15,158
- Reckon you fellas are waitin' for me.
- We sure are!

803
00:51:15,289 --> 00:51:17,405
You don't know the trouble you've caused!

804
00:51:17,529 --> 00:51:21,158
Dad-gum it, Ed Earl!
If you ain't a pluperfect fool!

805
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:25,249
You may be right. I got over a dozen
messages here from outraged citizens...

806
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:27,964
...tellin' me we got a whorehouse
in Lanville County.

807
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:30,445
Only been one here for about 150 years.

808
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:33,368
Ed Earl, you can set up speed traps
to catch the tourists.

809
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:37,244
You can look the other way when
a kid swipes a car to go joyridin'.

810
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:39,406
You can even let Miss Mona run her place!

811
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:43,318
But there's one thing you can't do:
Broadcast gutter talk on TV.

812
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:47,489
- I didn't know they was takin' pictures.
- What were the cameras for?

813
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:50,488
Damn it, CJ! You pious pissant.

814
00:51:51,251 --> 00:51:54,004
I don't have one tenth the trouble
from Miss Mona's...

815
00:51:54,131 --> 00:51:57,885
...that I have from one of your
stag parties at the legionnaire hall.

816
00:51:58,011 --> 00:52:00,320
- That ain't fair.
- There's just one thing to do.

817
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:03,170
Close the place before we all
go to hell in a handbasket.

818
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:04,644
Close it down!

819
00:52:04,771 --> 00:52:08,161
She was just fine as long as
she was makin' civic contributions...

820
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:11,363
...but the moment her luck ran sour,
you want to run out on her.

821
00:52:11,491 --> 00:52:14,289
Run out on her like rats
from a burnin' barn!

822
00:52:14,411 --> 00:52:18,006
That's just it, Ed Earl.
Who's gonna put out that fire?

823
00:52:18,131 --> 00:52:21,328
Look, if you won't close her down,
tell her to lay low!

824
00:52:21,452 --> 00:52:24,205
Yeah. Just until the heat
wears off a little bit.

825
00:52:24,332 --> 00:52:26,800
Give it two months.
What's two months?

826
00:52:26,932 --> 00:52:29,685
Nobody tells me
how to run my goddamn job!

827
00:52:29,812 --> 00:52:31,768
And nobody gives me advice!

828
00:52:31,892 --> 00:52:35,851
I'll do things my own way.
I'm gonna make up my own damn mind!

829
00:52:36,972 --> 00:52:38,928
Two months.
What's two months?

830
00:52:39,052 --> 00:52:41,520
Shut down for two months!

831
00:52:41,652 --> 00:52:44,962
That is a hell of a lot
to ask somebody, Ed Earl.

832
00:52:45,092 --> 00:52:49,085
And that's a hell of a lot of overhead
to pay out when cash ain't comin' in.

833
00:52:49,213 --> 00:52:52,444
- What will I tell my girls?
- Well, maybe it won't be two months.

834
00:52:52,573 --> 00:52:56,851
The holidays are comin'. Maybe in a week
or two the whole thing will blow over...

835
00:52:56,973 --> 00:53:01,364
I warned you yesterday about
losin' your temper and carryin' on.

836
00:53:01,493 --> 00:53:06,123
- Last night you was proud of me.
- Last night I wasn't on the 11.00 news!

837
00:53:06,653 --> 00:53:09,770
I didn't know that son of a bitch
was gonna make an idiot out of me.

838
00:53:09,893 --> 00:53:14,091
I don't know about that electronic bullshit!
How was I supposed to handle that?

839
00:53:14,213 --> 00:53:17,683
That's your job, Ed Earl.
Ain't that what they pay you for?

840
00:53:17,813 --> 00:53:21,089
I know my job! Don't be tellin' me
what my goddamn job is!

841
00:53:21,214 --> 00:53:23,967
I could close this place down
in a New York minute!

842
00:53:24,094 --> 00:53:28,565
All I'm askin' for is a little cooperation
so I can get through a difficult situation...

843
00:53:28,694 --> 00:53:33,370
...with as little trouble as possible!
- OK, OK! I'll shut it down.

844
00:53:34,014 --> 00:53:37,131
- You will?
- What do you want? A written contract?

845
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:41,524
- You promise?
- Ed Earl, I am givin' you my word.

846
00:53:46,054 --> 00:53:49,126
I'm sorry, Mona, about the whole situation.

847
00:53:49,255 --> 00:53:51,405
Don't feel sorry for me.

848
00:53:52,015 --> 00:53:55,610
I started out poor
and I worked my way up to outcast.

849
00:53:59,015 --> 00:54:03,008
I know what I'm askin' is gonna turn out
to be the best thing for both of us.

850
00:54:03,135 --> 00:54:05,490
Just trust me.

851
00:54:08,095 --> 00:54:10,325
You know what burns my ass?

852
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:13,413
- What?
- A flame about three feet high.

853
00:54:14,615 --> 00:54:17,812
Of course I trust you, you big cowboy.
Ain't I always?

854
00:54:17,936 --> 00:54:19,449
Mm-hm.

855
00:54:19,576 --> 00:54:22,010
No need to stop now.

856
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,007
Now get outta here.

857
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:29,049
Everything's gonna turn out just fine.
Don't you worry about a thing, honey.

858
00:54:29,176 --> 00:54:31,770
Everything's gonna turn out
slicker than cat shit...

859
00:54:31,896 --> 00:54:34,251

cussin' Sheriff of Lanville County.

862
00:54:43,536 --> 00:54:46,289
- How are you, Sheriff?
- I'm fine. How are you, Porky?

863
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:50,092
Oh, Sheriff! I been real good all week.
I've lost six pounds.

864

867
00:54:59,417 --> 00:55:01,772
Well, Jewel, I just promised the sheriff...

868
00:55:01,897 --> 00:55:04,252
...that we're gonna shut down
for two months.

869
00:55:04,377 --> 00:55:06,766
What? How can you promise that?

870
00:55:06,897 --> 00:55:11,095
What about the football game
celebration tomorrow night?

871
00:55:11,217 --> 00:55:14,448
- I forgot all about that.
- It's the Thanksgiving game.

872
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:17,137
- That's real special.
- I know, Jewel!

873
00:55:17,258 --> 00:55:19,692
I don't know what to do now.
I did promise.

874
00:55:19,818 --> 00:55:24,096
You think, if we close the doors, just
went on as planned, that'd be all right?

875
00:55:24,218 --> 00:55:28,575
I'm sure it will, honey. That party
is a bigger tradition than the game.

They're such animals. Always yellin'

- What do you want, Fred?</i>

972
01:07:37,043 --> 01:07:39,113
I was makin' my rounds around town...

973
01:07:39,243 --> 01:07:43,282
...and I saw Melvin P Thorpe and a bunch
of fellas headed out to the Chicken Ranch.

974
01:07:43,403 --> 01:07:45,359
- Melvin P Thorpe.
- Uh-huh.

975
01:07:45,923 --> 01:07:47,959
Goin' out to the Chicken Ranch, was he?

976
01:07:48,083 --> 01:07:50,358
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

977
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:52,519
He's gonna be real disappointed!

978
01:07:53,723 --> 01:07:57,875
See, there ain't nothin' goin' on.
Miss Mona promised me to close down.

979
01:07:58,003 --> 01:08:00,312
Well, she didn't.
I was out there this evenin'.

980
01:08:00,444 --> 01:08:03,800
Those Aggies was just
celebratin' to beat the band.

981
01:08:04,884 --> 01:08:06,681
- Oh, no.
- Uh-huh!

982
01:08:06,804 --> 01:08:09,637
- Oh, shit!
- Uh-huh.

983
01:08:43,165 --> 01:08:45,121
Shh. Quiet.

984
01:08:47,765 --> 01:08:51,758
Sh. This may be the most important
scoop of my television career.

985
01:08:55,565 --> 01:08:57,521
Not now! Idiot boy.

986
01:09:00,446 --> 01:09:02,562
Give me that. Now.

987
01:09:02,686 --> 01:09:06,474
Good neighbours, we're about to enter
the whorehouse itself.

988
01:09:06,606 --> 01:09:08,278
Cut. Come on.

989
01:09:08,966 --> 01:09:10,843
Stay with me. Come on.

990
01:09:10,966 --> 01:09:13,161
Come on, boys.

991
01:09:13,286 --> 01:09:16,164
There's been a party here.
Watch your step. Sh.

992
01:09:18,646 --> 01:09:20,602
Hold this.

993
01:09:22,566 --> 01:09:24,284
<i>(creaks)</i>

994
01:09:25,686 --> 01:09:27,642
Damn quiet.

995
01:09:28,047 --> 01:09:30,003
Billy Joe, light switch.

996
01:09:35,007 --> 01:09:37,202
Shh. Come on. No!

997
01:09:38,607 --> 01:09:40,563
<i>(snoring)</i>

998
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:43,883
Careful.

999
01:09:45,407 --> 01:09:48,319
Henry... Lights. Light switch.

1000
01:09:48,447 --> 01:09:50,961
Watch me.
You know what you gotta do.

1001
01:09:52,567 --> 01:09:55,081
Bingo. Lights!

1002
01:09:55,207 --> 01:09:57,163
Everybody up!

1003
01:09:59,248 --> 01:10:00,806
Let's get 'em!

1004
01:10:01,808 --> 01:10:03,764
All right! Come along!

1005
01:10:06,848 --> 01:10:07,997
Oh, shit!

1006
01:10:13,968 --> 01:10:16,482
- Jewel, what in hell is goin' on?
- Call the sheriff!

1007
01:10:16,608 --> 01:10:18,644
It's that Melvin P Thorpe sucker!

1008
01:10:20,768 --> 01:10:23,043
Oh! Ooh!

1009
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:25,438
They're smokin'! Cocaine!

1010
01:10:25,568 --> 01:10:27,479
Take their picture!

1011
01:10:35,249 --> 01:10:37,080
<i>- All right...
- (screams)</i>

1012
01:10:37,209 --> 01:10:39,086
Take her picture!
Thank you!

1013
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:14,847
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Y'all come back now, you hear?

1014
01:11:14,970 --> 01:11:17,530
Come on, boys!
Ooh! Look who's here.

1015
01:11:17,650 --> 01:11:20,039
Senator, the eyes of Texas are upon you.

1016
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:26,886
Come on, boys!
We got all we need.

1017
01:11:27,011 --> 01:11:28,330
Thank you, ma'am.

1018
01:11:29,371 --> 01:11:30,724
Oh!

1019
01:11:35,531 --> 01:11:36,805
Miss Mona!

1020
01:11:36,931 --> 01:11:38,887
Melvin P Thorpe. Gotcha!

1021
01:11:41,531 --> 01:11:45,490
Let's get to those vans!
We're gonna make the mornin' news!

1022
01:12:14,652 --> 01:12:16,802
<i>See you on TV! (laughs)</i>

1023
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:18,809
Holy shit!

1024
01:12:18,932 --> 01:12:20,888
God almighty.

1025
01:12:34,093 --> 01:12:37,165
Damn it! You gave me your word!
And I took it!

1026
01:12:37,293 --> 01:12:39,932
- Now, I'm the law!
- That law! Talk about the law!

1027
01:12:40,053 --> 01:12:44,922
A bunch of crazies break into my house,
takin' pictures, invadin' my privacy.

1028
01:12:45,053 --> 01:12:48,523
Do you wanna know what the law's
gonna do? I can tell you - nothin'!

1029
01:12:48,653 --> 01:12:51,770
They had no reason to do nothin'
if you'd done what you said!

1030
01:12:51,893 --> 01:12:53,849
I trusted you. That's what hurt.

1031
01:12:53,974 --> 01:12:58,047
Don't you talk to me about trust!
I trusted you to protect me!

1032
01:12:58,174 --> 01:13:00,642
I made a mistake tonight, OK?

1033
01:13:01,054 --> 01:13:04,444
If that's your apology,
it ain't worth armadillo crap.

1034
01:13:04,574 --> 01:13:08,408
I ain't apologisin'! I'm a businesswoman
payin' out double taxes!

1035
01:13:08,534 --> 01:13:12,891
I expect a little protection for my money!
Where were you? I couldn't get you...

1036
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:16,211
I was in bed, because you gave me
your word you were closin' down.

1037
01:13:16,334 --> 01:13:19,053
If Sheriff Jack Roy Wallace
was here, none of this...

1038
01:13:19,174 --> 01:13:22,723
Sheriff Jack Roy Wallace
couldn't hold my jock!

1039
01:13:22,855 --> 01:13:25,210
Goddamn it, Mona, you're makin' me mad!

1040
01:13:25,335 --> 01:13:29,692
Whoo! Listen at him cuss and shout.
Just like on TV!

1041
01:13:29,815 --> 01:13:32,454
You're just a kid
playin' at bein' a cowboy.

1042
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,725
You ain't never gonna grow up!

1043
01:13:34,855 --> 01:13:36,811
You use me as your mistress.

1044
01:13:36,935 --> 01:13:39,847
You use that damn Dulcie Mae
as your in-town wife.

1045
01:13:39,975 --> 01:13:42,045
You even use that little boy of hers...

1046
01:13:42,175 --> 01:13:44,848
...so you can play weekend daddy!
- Leave him out of it!

1047
01:13:44,975 --> 01:13:49,969
You're playin'. You're just a big,
overgrown kid playin' at bein' a man!

1048
01:13:50,095 --> 01:13:53,132
I don't have to listen to this shit. Damn it!

1049
01:13:53,256 --> 01:13:57,454
I'm the law. If I choose to, I'll close
this place down till hell freezes over.

1050
01:13:57,576 --> 01:14:01,694
Don't you threaten me.
I'm tellin' the truth, and you know it!

1051
01:14:01,816 --> 01:14:05,695
And all of your big dreams
of goin' to the legislature.

1052
01:14:05,816 --> 01:14:10,571
They're just dreams, cos you ain't never
gonna be no more than you are right now.

1053
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:14,006
A chickenshit sheriff
in a chickenshit town.

1054
01:14:16,536 --> 01:14:20,324
You may be right. It's a hell of a lot
better than bein' a whore.

1055
01:15:20,859 --> 01:15:24,135
<i>Legalised prostitution, pro or con,
is in the news today.</i>

1056
01:15:24,259 --> 01:15:27,729
<i>For a report, here is
Jeff Gerald in Gilbert, Texas.</i>

1057
01:15:29,139 --> 01:15:31,778
The Chicken Ranch,
the legendary bawdyhouse...

1058
01:15:31,899 --> 01:15:36,051
...is showing little activity after the
disclosure of the Thanksgiving-night raid.

1059
01:15:36,179 --> 01:15:39,694
- Get away!
- The deputy keeps away onlookers...

1060
01:15:39,819 --> 01:15:44,131
...while up at the house the doors are
closed and the principals are not talking.

1061
01:15:44,579 --> 01:15:46,968
<i>The Sheriff of Gilbert
refused interviews,...</i>

1062
01:15:47,099 --> 01:15:50,694
<i>...while in Houston the man who launched
the campaign, Melvin P Thorpe,...</i>

1063
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:52,776
<i>...held a press conference today.</i>

1064
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:55,289
This report says that the Chicken Ranch...

1065
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:59,413
...is involved with and under the influence
of organised crime.

1066
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:04,091
I am gonna take this report to Austin
in the hopes that the governor himself...

1067
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:08,338
...will come out of his long silence
on this issue and uphold the law.

1068
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:11,532
<i>- (applause)
- Thank you. Thank you very much.</i>

1069
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,936
<i>The governor made no statement,...</i>

1070
01:16:14,060 --> 01:16:17,575
<i>...but Senator Charles Wingwood,
a principal figure in the raid,...</i>

1071
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:20,419
<i>...held a press conference
explaining his involvement.</i>

1072
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:24,056
I have no independent recollection
of going to the Chicken Ranch.

1073
01:16:24,181 --> 01:16:28,697
I can only say, as the most dedicated
anti-Communist in the state legislature...

1074
01:16:28,821 --> 01:16:32,700
...that I must have been drugged by
Communists or Communist sympathisers...

1075
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:36,496
...and placed there to harm
my reputation and good name.

1076
01:16:36,621 --> 01:16:38,976
Reaction across the state
is split 50-50.

1077
01:16:39,101 --> 01:16:42,173
But here in Gilbert,
the Chicken Ranch has many supporters.

1078
01:16:42,301 --> 01:16:46,738
I ain't never seen anything bad come out
of there, and I've lived here all my life.

1079
01:16:46,861 --> 01:16:49,739
Why, they attract a lot
of business to the community.

1080
01:16:49,862 --> 01:16:52,422
They pay their taxes,
just like you and me!

1081
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:56,578
No one... no one was ever
forced to go up there.

1082
01:16:56,742 --> 01:16:59,893
My Frank, when he was alive,
used to go up there every Saturday.

1083
01:17:00,022 --> 01:17:04,061
I took it as a blessin'.
Of course, things were different then.

1084
01:17:04,182 --> 01:17:08,095
Nowadays women enjoy doin'
that sort of thing themselves.

1085
01:17:08,222 --> 01:17:10,372
At least, so I've been told.

1086
01:17:10,502 --> 01:17:13,300
The Chicken Ranch?
I think it's a good idea.

1087
01:17:13,422 --> 01:17:16,573
See, you take young boys
and they're gonna be lookin' for women.

1088
01:17:16,702 --> 01:17:19,614
If they can't find 'em, they'll rape 'em.
And if they don't...

1089
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:23,656
...they'll run to other women and get
diseases! Those girls went to doctors.

1090
01:17:23,783 --> 01:17:27,298
Although petitions are being circulated
to save the Chicken Ranch...

1091
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:30,062
...this bumper sticker
is beginning to appear.

1092
01:17:30,503 --> 01:17:35,372
<i>And so, as feminists support the bill for
the decriminalisation of prostitution...</i>

1093
01:17:35,503 --> 01:17:38,779
<i>...while traditionalists
lobby for its defeat,...</i>

1094
01:17:38,903 --> 01:17:43,419
<i>...the fate of the Chicken Ranch rests with
the governor, who again was unavailable.</i>

1095
01:17:43,783 --> 01:17:46,013
<i>Jeff Gerald, ABC News,
Gilbert, Texas.</i>

1096
01:17:46,143 --> 01:17:48,099
<i>Thank you, Jeff. If there are...</i>

1097
01:17:49,864 --> 01:17:52,253
Well, I hate admitting
I was wrong, Miss Mona.

1098
01:17:52,384 --> 01:17:55,137
But with television broadcasting all this...

1099
01:17:55,264 --> 01:17:59,780
...we should've done what the sheriff said
and kept this place closed.

1100
01:17:59,904 --> 01:18:02,702
It was my fault, Jewel. It was my decision.

1101
01:18:02,824 --> 01:18:05,418
He ain't gonna be able to stop it
this time, is he?

1102
01:18:05,544 --> 01:18:08,980
No. He'd like to,
but he's out of his league.

1103
01:18:09,104 --> 01:18:11,174
He don't know how to fight 'em.

1104
01:18:11,304 --> 01:18:15,183
He's just a good old boy
that ain't never gonna grow up.

1105
01:18:15,304 --> 01:18:17,613
Honey, we see everything
in this profession.

1106
01:18:17,745 --> 01:18:21,420
But one thing I ain't never seen,
man nor woman, is a grown-up.

1107
01:18:21,545 --> 01:18:24,343
Don't be too hard on him.
He loves you.

1108
01:18:28,305 --> 01:18:31,058
Well, he ain't never said it.

1109
01:18:31,185 --> 01:18:33,938
Some men can't say the words, honey.

1110
01:18:34,065 --> 01:18:37,296
But that don't mean
they don't feel it in their heart.

1111
01:18:37,825 --> 01:18:40,942
Well, it's just as well anyhow, Jewel.

1112
01:18:41,065 --> 01:18:43,704
I set my course a long time ago...

1113
01:18:44,705 --> 01:18:47,060
...and I can't go changin' now.

1114
01:18:51,506 --> 01:18:56,421
I don't know what to do. Folks got nothin'
to talk about but this Chicken Ranch mess.

1115
01:18:56,546 --> 01:18:59,379
Like a broken record:
Chicken Ranch, Chicken Ranch...

1116
01:18:59,506 --> 01:19:02,339
All of this bad publicity's
flat ruinin' business.

1117
01:19:02,466 --> 01:19:06,220
- I haven't sold a car in a week.
- It's ruinin' the town.

1118
01:19:06,346 --> 01:19:09,418
No one's blamin' you, Ed Earl.
It ain't your fault.

1119
01:19:09,546 --> 01:19:12,344
But we can't just sit around here
waitin' to grow tits!

1120
01:19:12,466 --> 01:19:15,344
The way I see it, the Chicken Ranch
served a purpose once.

1121
01:19:15,467 --> 01:19:17,423
But now everything's openin' up.

1122
01:19:17,547 --> 01:19:21,062
Do you know we are in the middle
of a worldwide sexual revolution?

1123
01:19:21,187 --> 01:19:23,906
Why, Miss Mona's ain't obscene,
it's just obsolete.

1124
01:19:24,027 --> 01:19:27,019
She ain't got a handful
of supporters left, Ed Earl.

1125
01:19:27,267 --> 01:19:32,022
All this publicity's makin' folks think twice
about signin' that petition.

1126
01:19:32,147 --> 01:19:36,857
Why can't that station in Houston look at
the cesspool in their own back yard?

1127
01:19:36,987 --> 01:19:39,865
How about Austin?
Two blocks from the state capitol...

1128
01:19:39,987 --> 01:19:43,343
...you can have anything done to you
that you can get in Tangiers!

1129
01:19:43,467 --> 01:19:45,742
There's naked massages, tongue baths...

1130
01:19:45,868 --> 01:19:48,257
...somebody ticklin' your ass with a feather.

1131
01:19:48,388 --> 01:19:52,176
If you know that for a fact,
Mr Newspaper Editor...

1132
01:19:52,308 --> 01:19:54,264
...it's your duty to expose it!

1133
01:19:54,388 --> 01:19:59,098
Now, you see here, CJ! I don't give
a damn if folks want their ass tickled!

1134
01:19:59,228 --> 01:20:02,584
I kinda like to think that
that's what heaven is all about.

1135
01:20:04,948 --> 01:20:08,623
Boys, I got myself
a pretty good bullshit detector.

1136
01:20:08,748 --> 01:20:13,264
I can tell when somebody's peein' on
my boots and tellin' me it's a rainstorm.

1137
01:20:13,388 --> 01:20:16,937
Now, this thing's gotten way outta hand.
I don't know how.

1138
01:20:17,069 --> 01:20:20,425
- I figure there's only one thing to do.
- Close it down!

1139
01:20:20,789 --> 01:20:23,747
Nope. I'm goin' to Austin.

1140
01:20:23,869 --> 01:20:27,782
See the governor. Tell him
Miss Mona's side of the situation.

1141
01:20:28,629 --> 01:20:31,223
He sure as hell won't hear about it
from anybody here.

1142
01:20:31,349 --> 01:20:34,659
- You can't go up and see the governor!
- He don't see anybody!

1143
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:36,939
He'll see me.

1144
01:20:48,870 --> 01:20:52,465
Feel like the country dog in the city.
If I stand still, they screw me.

1145
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:55,058
<i>- If I run, they bite me in the ass.
- (laughs)</i>

1146
01:20:56,030 --> 01:20:58,305
I... I wish...

1147
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:00,864
...there was somethin' I could do.

1148
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,946
Thank you.

1149
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:08,826
They want me to close her down,
run her out of town.

1150
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:16,104
How can I ask her to leave,
when all I want her to do is stay?

1151
01:21:35,631 --> 01:21:40,625
Ladies and gentlemen,
His Excellency, the Governor of Texas.

1152
01:21:43,512 --> 01:21:47,903
My friends, I want to thank you for that
sincere and heartwarming ovation.

1153
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,988
No questions, please.

1154
01:21:50,112 --> 01:21:53,309
Governor, what do you think of
the crisis in the Middle East?

1155
01:21:53,432 --> 01:21:57,311
I was sayin' at the weekly prayer
breakfast in this historic capitol...

1156
01:21:57,432 --> 01:21:59,662
...that it behooves
the Jews and the Arabs...

1157
01:21:59,792 --> 01:22:03,467
...to settle their differences
in a christian manner.

1158
01:22:03,592 --> 01:22:07,983
Have you seen the evidence of the
disgraceful situation at the Chicken Ranch?

1159
01:22:10,312 --> 01:22:14,590
} Fellow Texans, I am proudly

1160
01:22:15,073 --> 01:22:19,271
} Standing here to humbly say

1161
01:22:20,233 --> 01:22:22,189
} I assure you

1162
01:22:22,313 --> 01:22:24,383
} And I mean it

1163
01:22:24,513 --> 01:22:29,064
} Now, who says I don't speak out
as plain as day?

1164
01:22:29,193 --> 01:22:31,149
} And fellow Texans

1165
01:22:31,913 --> 01:22:35,349
} I'm for progress and the flag

1166
01:22:35,473 --> 01:22:38,510
} Long may it fly

1167
01:22:39,793 --> 01:22:43,342
} I'm a poor boy
come to greatness

1168
01:22:45,194 --> 01:22:48,664
} So it follows
that I cannot tell a lie

1169
01:22:50,274 --> 01:22:54,028
- What the hell did he say?
- Same as usual. Not a damn thing.

1170
01:22:58,314 --> 01:23:01,511
} Ooh, I love to dance
a little sidestep

1171

} Now they see me, now they don't,
I've come and gone

1174
01:23:16,075 --> 01:23:17,633

1176
01:23:20,995 --> 01:23:24,829
Governor, do you plan to take action
against the Chicken Ranch?

1177
01:23:24,955 --> 01:23:28,391
} Now, my good friends,
it behooves me

1178
01:23:28,675 --> 01:23:31,348
} To be solemn and declare

1179

} I'm for goodness and for profit

1180

} And for living clean
and saying daily prayer

1181
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:42,712
} And now, my good friends,
you can sleep nights

1182
01:23:43,236 --> 01:23:46,194

Why has the Chicken Ranch operation
been so long ignored?

1193
01:24:26,477 --> 01:24:28,433
We have acoustic problems in here.

and is very insistent.

No, no, no, no...

Hi, Sheriff!

1219
01:26:34,561 --> 01:26:36,836
Just talkin' about you.
How are ya?

1220
01:26:36,962 --> 01:26:39,760
Governor, I know I'm way outta line
comin' up here...

1221
01:26:39,882 --> 01:26:42,919
...but before you close the Chicken Ranch
you must know the facts.

1222
01:26:43,042 --> 01:26:46,000
I haven't made that decision!
My aides are workin' on that.

1223
01:26:46,122 --> 01:26:50,434
Well, the Chicken Ranch has been
in my county since before I was born.

1224
01:26:50,762 --> 01:26:54,960
Its doors have been open to soldiers
and presidents and farmers.

1225
01:26:55,762 --> 01:26:59,675
Even governors who can remember
what a great institution it is.

1226
01:27:00,482 --> 01:27:02,950
- No need to bring that up.
- I ain't threatenin' you.

1227
01:27:03,082 --> 01:27:05,801
Whatever you say, I'll do.
But think of the people.

1228
01:27:05,923 --> 01:27:09,154
I've known Miss Mona for 12 years.
You'll never meet a finer woman.

1229
01:27:09,283 --> 01:27:12,355
She never refuses a charity.
The whole town likes her.

1230
01:27:12,483 --> 01:27:15,953
Hospital fund, new swimmin' pool,
even the Little Leaguers.

1231
01:27:16,083 --> 01:27:19,917
She bought 'em uniforms so they wouldn't
have to play in their overalls.

1232
01:27:20,043 --> 01:27:21,999
Well...

1233
01:27:22,803 --> 01:27:25,954
I wasn't aware of her civic generosity.

1234
01:27:27,803 --> 01:27:30,636
- But the law is the law!
- Sometimes it's gotta be changed.

1235
01:27:30,763 --> 01:27:34,517
I been fightin' crime all my life,
but let's not confuse crime with sin.

1236
01:27:34,644 --> 01:27:38,717
You can't legislate morality.
Those girls have never caused any trouble.

1237
01:27:38,844 --> 01:27:41,802
They're healthy, taxpayin',
law-abidin' citizens...

1238
01:27:41,924 --> 01:27:45,553
...who supply a demand and provide
an economic asset to the community.

Whew! Ed Earl!

1240

You ever think about
runnin' for office? Huh?

1241
01:27:52,084 --> 01:27:57,636
I swear, you make that whorehouse sound
like a damn nonprofit recreational facility.

1242
01:27:57,764 --> 01:28:02,713
Governor, if the citizens who elected me
found it necessary to close it down...

1243
01:28:02,844 --> 01:28:04,436
...I would close it down.

1244
01:28:04,565 --> 01:28:07,159
If Miss Mona and the girls
that work for her...

1245
01:28:07,285 --> 01:28:10,436
...were jeopardisin' the health
or morals of the community...

1246
01:28:10,565 --> 01:28:12,123
...I would close it down.

1247
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:15,840
If the place was just a piddlin' nuisance,
an eyesore, a fire hazard...

1248
01:28:15,965 --> 01:28:18,399
...I would close it down!
But there's nothin'!

1249
01:28:18,525 --> 01:28:20,880
No reason except the goddamn cries...

- The polls.

1289
01:31:24,611 --> 01:31:26,567
Mona.

1290
01:31:27,331 --> 01:31:29,481
About the other night.

1291
01:31:31,132 --> 01:31:33,282
I lost my temper.

1292
01:31:34,452 --> 01:31:36,920
I said some things
I shouldn't have said.

1293
01:31:38,292 --> 01:31:40,248
I want to apologise.

1294
01:31:40,372 --> 01:31:42,283
Oh, it's all right, Ed Earl.

1295
01:31:42,412 --> 01:31:45,768
I think we both said
a whole lot of things we regret.

1296
01:31:45,892 --> 01:31:47,769
<i>If there's anything I can do...</i>

1297
01:31:47,892 --> 01:31:51,282
No, thank you.
I think you've done all you could.

1298
01:31:51,412 --> 01:31:53,368
I have to tell my girls.

1299
01:32:20,853 --> 01:32:22,809
<i>(bell)</i>

1300
01:32:26,133 --> 01:32:28,283
Well, the news has come.

1301
01:32:29,094 --> 01:32:31,289
Just got a call from the sheriff...

1302
01:32:31,414 --> 01:32:33,325
...and we are closed down.

1303
01:32:33,454 --> 01:32:35,410
Immediately and permanently.

1304
01:32:37,174 --> 01:32:39,813
Oh... What'll we do?

1305
01:32:40,614 --> 01:32:43,651
Well... Las Vegas, here I come.

1306
01:32:44,014 --> 01:32:47,689
Damn! I thought when the sheriff
went to speak to the governor...

1307
01:32:47,814 --> 01:32:50,692
...we'd get a reprieve.
- What did you say?

1308
01:32:51,174 --> 01:32:55,452
- Didn't you know about that, Miss Mona?
- He drove up last night.

1309
01:32:55,574 --> 01:32:59,123
The whole town's talkin' about
the way he fought for you.

1310
01:32:59,255 --> 01:33:01,371
Didn't he tell you that?

1311
01:33:01,495 --> 01:33:03,884
No. No, he didn't.

1312
01:33:32,936 --> 01:33:36,565
} Hey, maybe I'll dye my hair

1313
01:33:38,656 --> 01:33:41,011
} Maybe I'll move somewhere

1314
01:33:41,136 --> 01:33:43,092
} Maybe I'll get a car

1315
01:33:43,456 --> 01:33:48,371
} Maybe I'll drive so far
they'll all lose track

1316
01:33:48,776 --> 01:33:51,927
} Me, I'll bounce right back

1317
01:33:52,856 --> 01:33:54,926
} Maybe I'll sleep real late

1318
01:33:57,577 --> 01:33:59,647
} Maybe I'll lose some weight

1319
01:34:00,017 --> 01:34:02,167
} Maybe I'll clear my junk

1320
01:34:02,297 --> 01:34:07,530
} Maybe I'll just get drunk
on apple wine

1321
01:34:07,737 --> 01:34:13,255
} Me, I'll be just fine and dandy

1322
01:34:13,537 --> 01:34:17,735
} Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas

1323
01:34:17,977 --> 01:34:22,334
} I'm barely gettin' through tomorrow

1324
01:34:22,577 --> 01:34:26,968
} But still I won't let
sorrow bring me way down

1325
01:34:27,458 --> 01:34:31,451
} I'll be fine and dandy

1326
01:34:32,098 --> 01:34:36,330
} Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas

1327
01:34:36,458 --> 01:34:40,690
} I'm barely gettin' through tomorrow

1328
01:34:41,018 --> 01:34:46,217
} But still I won't let
sorrow bring me way down

1329
01:34:49,378 --> 01:34:53,087
} Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew

1330
01:34:54,618 --> 01:34:57,928
} Hey, maybe I'll just lie low

1331
01:34:58,059 --> 01:35:00,129
} Maybe I'll hit the bars

1332
01:35:00,259 --> 01:35:05,174
} Maybe I'll count the stars
until the dawn

1333
01:35:05,699 --> 01:35:09,294
} Me, I will go on

1334
01:35:09,659 --> 01:35:12,014
} Maybe I'll settle down

1335
01:35:14,259 --> 01:35:16,454
} Maybe I'll just leave town

1336
01:35:16,579 --> 01:35:18,615
} Maybe I'll have some fun

1337
01:35:18,939 --> 01:35:23,649
} Maybe I'll meet someone
and make him mine

1338
01:35:24,059 --> 01:35:29,452
} Me, I'll be just fine and dandy

1339
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:33,973
} Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas

1340
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:38,492
} I'm barely gettin' through tomorrow

1341
01:35:38,700 --> 01:35:43,091
} But still I won't let
sorrow bring me way down

1342
01:35:43,540 --> 01:35:47,613
} I'll be fine and dandy

1343
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:52,338
} Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas

1344
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:56,692
} I'm barely gettin' through tomorrow

1345
01:35:56,981 --> 01:36:01,259
} But still I won't let
sorrow bring me way down

1346
01:36:03,981 --> 01:36:07,940
} I'll be fine and dandy

1347
01:36:08,501 --> 01:36:12,574
} Lord, it's like a hard candy Christmas

1348
01:36:12,901 --> 01:36:17,133
} I'm barely gettin' through tomorrow

1349
01:36:17,381 --> 01:36:21,818
} But still I won't let
sorrow bring me way down

1350
01:36:42,782 --> 01:36:46,855
<i>} I'll be fine</i>

1351
01:36:47,382 --> 01:36:51,455
<i>} I'll be fine</i>

1352
01:36:52,062 --> 01:36:57,056
<i>} I'll be fine</i>

1353
01:37:10,863 --> 01:37:15,254
So the girls left, and it was
a sorry day for Lanville County.

1354
01:37:18,223 --> 01:37:20,179
Kinda like the end of an era.

1355
01:37:20,663 --> 01:37:23,541
You know, like when you graduate
from high school?

1356
01:37:23,664 --> 01:37:25,939
Things are just never the same again.

1357
01:37:28,024 --> 01:37:31,096
Ed Earl's up in the state legislature now...

1358
01:37:31,224 --> 01:37:33,374
...and I became the sheriff.

1359
01:37:39,784 --> 01:37:42,378
I suppose you're wonderin'
what happened to Miss Mona.

1360
01:37:42,504 --> 01:37:45,940
Well, Ed Earl drove up there
on her last day.

1361
01:38:01,465 --> 01:38:03,740
- Hey, Sheriff.
- Good morning, Jewel.

1362
01:38:03,865 --> 01:38:07,221
I'm so pleased to see you.
I knew you couldn't let me leave...

1363
01:38:07,345 --> 01:38:10,337
...without a sweet goodbye
for your old Porky.

1364
01:38:12,665 --> 01:38:15,020
- Goodbye, Jewel.
- Goodbye, Sheriff.

1365
01:38:15,145 --> 01:38:18,057
I sure hope you come up north
to visit Miss Mona and me.

1366
01:38:18,185 --> 01:38:20,335
- Where is she?
- Inside.

1367
01:38:22,386 --> 01:38:24,980
See you're takin' the old juke with you.

1368
01:38:25,106 --> 01:38:28,781
Now, you know I couldn't leave
without my bell and my box.

1369
01:39:10,667 --> 01:39:13,101
Ed Earl?

1370
01:39:14,707 --> 01:39:17,346
This old place looks
kinda funny, don't it?

1371
01:39:17,787 --> 01:39:22,781
Ben Sawtuck bought all my furniture and
Langston downtown's gonna sell the rest.

1372
01:39:27,468 --> 01:39:31,177
- Mona, I wanna tell you somethin'.
- I want you to thank your boys for me.

1373
01:39:31,308 --> 01:39:36,098
Those reporters would have got outta hand
if it hadn't been for your deputies.

1374
01:39:37,668 --> 01:39:40,626
- You know me better than...
- Ed Earl, the thing to do...

1375
01:39:40,748 --> 01:39:44,502
...is to put this whole thing behind you
just as quick as you can.

1376
01:39:44,628 --> 01:39:47,825
I've made a little money, I've laughed,
I've danced to the music.

1377
01:39:47,948 --> 01:39:50,940
It's just time to pay the fiddler, that's all.

1378
01:39:53,389 --> 01:39:56,347
Mona, we've been together a long time.

1379
01:39:56,469 --> 01:39:59,859
Sometimes I think you know me
better than I know myself.

1380
01:40:01,149 --> 01:40:03,424
You know how hard
this is for me to say.

1381
01:40:05,549 --> 01:40:07,505
I love you.

1382
01:40:09,429 --> 01:40:11,340
Will you marry me?

1383
01:40:11,469 --> 01:40:14,859
Oh, Ed Earl, I've loved you
since I was 16 years old.

1384
01:40:15,389 --> 01:40:18,142
But I've thought about this
for a long time.

1385
01:40:18,269 --> 01:40:20,544
And as much as I'd love
for it to work...

1386
01:40:20,670 --> 01:40:24,026
...I know deep down in my heart
it ain't never gonna be.

1387
01:40:24,150 --> 01:40:26,869
- Didn't you hear what I said?
- I did, darlin'.

1388
01:40:26,990 --> 01:40:29,504
But it's gonna always be
just like it is.

1389
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:32,903
There just ain't no way
in this world it can work.

1390
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:36,662
<i>We could make it work.
Just have to give it a chance.</i>

1391
01:40:38,670 --> 01:40:43,300
} If I should stay

1392
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:49,824
} Well, I would only be in your way

1393
01:40:51,511 --> 01:40:54,469
} And so I'll go

1394
01:40:55,031 --> 01:40:57,989
} And yet I know

1395
01:40:58,671 --> 01:41:03,699
} That I'll think of you
each step of the way

1396
01:41:06,271 --> 01:41:09,183
} And I

1397
01:41:09,831 --> 01:41:14,905
} Will always love you

1398
01:41:15,031 --> 01:41:19,627
} I will always

1399
01:41:19,752 --> 01:41:23,984
} Love you

1400
01:41:26,712 --> 01:41:31,342
} Bittersweet memories

1401
01:41:33,512 --> 01:41:38,381
} I guess that's all
I'll be takin' with me

1402
01:41:41,032 --> 01:41:42,988
} Goodbye

1403
01:41:43,352 --> 01:41:45,502
} Oh, please, don't cry

1404
01:41:46,753 --> 01:41:53,909
} Cos we both know
that I'm not what you need

1405
01:41:54,353 --> 01:41:57,072
} But I

1406
01:41:57,433 --> 01:42:02,791
} Will always love you

1407
01:42:02,913 --> 01:42:07,145
} I will always

1408
01:42:07,593 --> 01:42:11,552
} Love you

1409
01:42:16,834 --> 01:42:19,268
I know you're gonna get your dream.

1410
01:42:20,034 --> 01:42:23,709
And I know you're gonna do
a real good job in the legislature.

1411
01:42:24,834 --> 01:42:27,871
- But if you was to marry me...
- Wait a second.

1412
01:42:28,634 --> 01:42:30,829
I love you.

1413
01:42:31,514 --> 01:42:34,108
I don't give a damn what people say.

1414
01:42:39,634 --> 01:42:40,828
Jewel! Hold it right there!

1415
01:42:40,954 --> 01:42:42,910
What's that, Sheriff?

1416
01:42:45,475 --> 01:42:48,228
- Which one of them bags is hers?
- That one.

1417
01:42:49,035 --> 01:42:51,833
And that one there, there...

1418
01:42:59,195 --> 01:43:00,992
Oh, Sheriff!

1419
01:43:03,795 --> 01:43:06,263
I always knew you'd come through!

1420
01:43:20,756 --> 01:43:22,712
Whoa!

1421
01:44:17,878 --> 01:44:21,791
<i>(Fred) Well, that's pretty darn close
to the way it happened.</i>

1422
01:44:21,918 --> 01:44:25,513
<i>The old Watchdog, Melvin P Thorpe,
got what he wanted.</i>

1423
01:44:26,558 --> 01:44:30,028
<i>Miss Mona married Ed Earl,
and they got what they wanted.</i>

1424
01:44:30,918 --> 01:44:35,070
<i>And the people of Texas,
well, they got what they wanted:</i>

1425
01:44:35,198 --> 01:44:39,237
<i>Another legend.
The legend of the Chicken Ranch.</i>

1426
01:44:40,238 --> 01:44:43,355
<i>} It's just a little bitty
pissant country place</i>
