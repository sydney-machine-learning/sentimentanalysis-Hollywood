1
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,036
There are more than yesterday.

2
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:30,733
He will be saying prayers in
the garden. Just follow the others.

3
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:48,144
Brother, Bapu is already
late for prayers.

4
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,940
Oh, God!

5
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,453
The object of this massive tribute...

6
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,705
...died as he had always lived:

7
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,291
A private man without wealth...

8
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:53,918
...without property...

9
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,629
...without official title or office.

10
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,131
Mahatma Gandhi...

11
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,175
...was not the commander of armies...

12
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,970
...nor a ruler of vast lands.

13
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,181
He could not boast
any scientific achievement...

14
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,141
...or artistic gift.

15
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,601
Yet men...

16
00:05:10,936 --> 00:05:15,564
...governments, dignitaries
from all over the world...

17
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,733
...have joined hands today
to pay homage...

18
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,569
...to this little brown man
in the loincloth...

19
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:23,656
...who led his country to freedom.

20
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,867
In the words of
General George C. Marshall...

21
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,162
...the American secretary of state:

22
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,582
"Mahatma Gandhi has become
the spokesman...

23
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,711
...for the conscience of all mankind.

24
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:38,504
He was a man...

25
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,214
...who made humility...

26
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,049
...and simple truth...

27
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,302
...more powerful than empires."

28
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:47,471
And Albert Einstein added:

29
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:52,351
"Generations to come will scarce
believe that such a one as this...

30
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,729
...ever in flesh and blood...

31
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,773
...walked upon this earth."

32
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,818
Tell me...

33
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,862
...do you think about hell?

34
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,032
No, neither do I.

35
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,326
But this man here...

36
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:53,954
...is a Christian, and he's written
that in order to believe--

37
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,251
Excuse me, sir.

38
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,921
How long have you been
in South Africa?

39
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,925
-A week.
-l don't know how you got a ticket.

40
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,969
Just what are you doing
in this car, coolie?

41
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,014
Why, l have a ticket.

42
00:07:12,474 --> 00:07:14,517
A first-class ticket.

43
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,354
-How did you get it?
-l sent for it in the post.

44
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:19,855
I'm an attorney.
I didn't--

45
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,358
There are no colored attorneys
in South Africa.

46
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,692
Sit where you belong!

47
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,070
-l'll take your luggage back, sir.
-No.

48
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:28,197
Just a moment, please.

49
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,157
You see?

50
00:07:31,034 --> 00:07:33,869
Mohandas K. Gandhi, attorney at law.

51
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,206
I'm going to conduct a case
for an lndian trading firm.

52
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:42,128
Didn't you hear me? There are no
colored attorneys in South Africa.

53
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:44,713
I was called to the bar in London...

54
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,175
...and enrolled at
the High Court of Chancery.

55
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,302
I am, therefore, an attorney.

56
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,055
And since l am,
in your eyes, colored...

57
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,391
...l think we can deduce
there is at least...

58
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,726
...one colored attorney
in South Africa.

59
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,813
Smart bloody Kaffir!

60
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:02,106
Throw him out.

61
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,692
Just move your black ass
back to third class...

62
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,319
...or l'll have you thrown off
at the next station.

63
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,321
But l always go first class!

64
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,893
But you're a rich man.
Why put up with it?

65
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,520
Yes, l am rich. But l am lndian.

66
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,065
I do not expect
to travel first class.

67
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,734
-ln England, I was a poor student.
-That was England.

68
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,569
This is part of England's Empire.

69
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:35,532
Mr. Gandhi, you look at Mr. Khan and
you see a successful Muslim trader.

70
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,577
Most South Africans see him
simply as an Indian.

71
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:42,539
And the vast majority of Indians,
mostly Hindus, like yourself...

72
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:45,709
...were brought here to
work mines and harvest crops.

73
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,420
Most Europeans don't want them
doing anything else.

74
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:52,508
-But that is very unchristian--
-Mr. Gandhi, in this country...

75
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,553
...lndians are not allowed to walk
along the pavement with a Christian.

76
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,559
You mean, you employ Mr. Baker
as your attorney...

77
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,937
...but you can't walk down the street
with him?

78
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,313
Well, l can.

79
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,775
But l risk being kicked
into the gutter by someone...

80
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,611
...less holy than Mr. Baker.

81
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:24,581
Well, then it must be fought.

82
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,167
We are children of God
like everyone else.

83
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:28,669
Allah be praised!

84
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,380
And what battalions
will you call upon?

85
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,303
I will write to the press...

86
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,763
...here and in England.

87
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,348
I will use the courts.

88
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,018
You'll cause a lot of trouble.
Our position is--

89
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,812
We are members of the Empire.

90
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,025
And we come from
an ancient civilization.

91
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,862
Why should we not walk on
the pavements like other men?

92
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:59,158
I rather like the idea of
an Indian barrister in South Africa.

93
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,454
I'm sure our community could
keep you in work for some time...

94
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,415
...even if you caused
a good deal of trouble.

95
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,420
Especially if you caused
a good deal of trouble.

96
00:11:30,982 --> 00:11:33,984
There's the English reporter.
I told you he'd come.

97
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,448
You also said your article
would draw a thousand people.

98
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,329
At least some of the Hindus
brought their wives.

99
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:49,166
No, I asked my wife
to organize that.

100
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,127
Some of them are leaving.

101
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,846
"Ladies and gentlemen...

102
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:07,267
...we have asked you to gather here
to help us proclaim our right...

103
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,646
...to be treated as equal citizens
of the Empire.

104
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,940
We do not seek conflict.

105
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,152
We know the strength of
the forces arrayed against us...

106
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:22,241
...know that because of them,
we can only use peaceful means.

107
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,786
But we are determined
that justice will be done.

108
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,166
The symbol of our status
is embodied in this pass...

109
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,710
...which we must carry
at all times...

110
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,797
...but which no European
even has to have.

111
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,883
The first step towards
changing our status...

112
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,262
...is to eliminate
this difference between us."

113
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,522
Now?

114
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:02,114
You write brilliantly, but you have
much to learn about handling men.

115
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,660
"We do not want to ignite...

116
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:10,289
...the fear or hatred of anyone.

117
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,249
But we ask you...

118
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:15,711
...Hindu, Muslim and Sikh...

119
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,755
...to help us light up the sky...

120
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,301
...and the minds of
the British authorities...

121
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:25,679
...with our defiance
of this injustice."

122
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:31,894
We will now burn the passes of
our committee and its supporters.

123
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:36,273
We ask you to put
your passes on the fire--

124
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,816
You bloody dog!

125
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,365
Those passes...

126
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,493
...are government property!

127
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,997
And l will arrest the first man
who tries to burn one!

128
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:04,885
Take him away.

129
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,991
You little...

130
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,618
...Sammy...

131
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:31,203
...bastard!

132
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,624
Now! Are there any more?

133
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,044
If you want this kind of trouble,
you can have it.

134
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:07,197
Let me go!

135
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,426
Stop.

136
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,989
The London papers have
arrived from the Cape.

137
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:52,159
The worstwas the Daily Mail.
They said the burning of passes...

138
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:55,495
-Ask Mr. Herzog to see me.
-...was the most significant act...

139
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,957
...in colonial affairs since
the Declaration of Independence.

140
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,460
They'll find we're better
prepared this time.

141
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:04,838
Mr. Gandhi will find
he's on a long hiding to nothing.

142
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,426
"A High Court judge confirmed
that Mr. Gandhi...

143
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:13,055
...would've been within his rights
to prosecute for assault...

144
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:16,391
...since neither he nor Mr. Khan
resisted arrest."

145
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,352
I told you about English law.

146
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:21,521
As l told you about English policemen.

147
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,815
Yes?

148
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:27,736
We're very pleased
to have you back, Papa.

149
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,238
And l am glad to be back.

150
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,282
Come.

151
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,868
Mind your face.

152
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,628
Tomorrow l'll tell you about
my days in a police hospital.

153
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,255
Come, come.

154
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,390
Just like proper English gentlemen.
I'm proud of them.

155
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,893
They're boys and they're lndian.

156
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,732
Will you take this off?
It pinches every time l speak.

157
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,448
I've got it.

158
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,458
You'd be Gandhi.

159
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,545
I thought you'd be bigger.

160
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:30,257
-l'm sorry.
-No, that's all right.

161
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,385
My name is Charlie Andrews, sir.

162
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:34,886
I've come from lndia.

163
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:38,682
I've read a great deal about you.

164
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,851
Some of it good, l hope.

165
00:17:42,937 --> 00:17:44,312
Would you care to walk?

166
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,400
-You're a clergyman?
-Yes.

167
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,527
I met some remarkable people in India.

168
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,780
And when I read what you were doing,
I wanted to help.

169
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,907
-Does that surprise you?
-Not anymore.

170
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,909
At first, I was amazed...

171
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,829
...but when you're fighting
in a just cause...

172
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,375
...people seem to pop up, like you,
right out of the pavement.

173
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,503
Even when it's dangerous or....

174
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:13,216
Hey, look what's coming!

175
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,636
A white shepherd leading
a brown Sammy!

176
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:21,266
-Perhaps we should....
-Doesn't the New Testament say:

177
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:24,936
"If your enemy strikes you on
the right cheek, offer him the left"?

178
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,939
The phrase was used metaphorically.
I don't think our Lord--

179
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,818
I'm not so sure.
I have thought about it a great deal.

180
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,070
I suspect he meant
you must show courage...

181
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:37,407
...be willing to take a blow,
several blows, to show...

182
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,285
...you won't strike back,
nor will you be turned aside.

183
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:44,414
And when you do that, it calls on
something in human nature...

184
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:48,251
...that makes his hatred for you
decrease and his respect increase.

185
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:51,797
I think Christ grasped that,
and l have seen it work.

186
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,340
Good morning.

187
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,842
Get off the pavement,
you bloody coon.

188
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,385
-Yeah, get off.
-Kaffir!

189
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:01,807
-Colin, what you doing?
-Nothing.

190
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,892
Come out where l can see you!

191
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,148
I said, what you doing?

192
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,401
We were just trying
to clean up the neighborhood.

193
00:19:13,611 --> 00:19:16,988
You're late for work.
I thought you'd gone 1 0 minutes ago.

194
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:18,990
Get on!

195
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:27,123
You'll find there's room for us all.

196
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,509
-That was lucky.
-l thought you were a man of God.

197
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,886
I am, but l'm not
so egotistical as to think...

198
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,972
...he plans his day
around my dilemmas.

199
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,311
You could call it
a communal farm, l suppose.

200
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,022
But you've all come
to the same conclusions.

201
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,775
Our Gita, the Muslim's Koran,
your Bible.

202
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:57,195
It's always the simple things
that catch your breath.

203
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,781
"Love thy neighbor as thyself."

204
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:01,950
Not always practiced...

205
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,537
...but it's something we Hindus
could learn a lot from.

206
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:08,456
That's the kind of thing
you'll be seeking on this farm?

207
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,125
Well, we shall try.

208
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,210
Bad news, I'm afraid.

209
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,130
They're going to change
the pass laws.

210
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:23,388
It's taken time,
but it needed to be done fairly.

211
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,350
We didn't want to create an injustice
simply because Mr. Gandhi...

212
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,811
...was abusing our
existing legislation.

213
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:32,606
Just one moment, sir, please.

214
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,776
I beg your pardon.

215
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:39,905
But on a short trip...

216
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:44,034
...l wouldn't spend too much time
on the Indian question, Mr. Walker.

217
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,036
It's a tiny factor
in South Africa.

218
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,665
Well, it is news at the moment.

219
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,668
I plan to report on
the condition of the mines here...

220
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,503
-...as well as the economy.
-Good.

221
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,381
But l would like to meet
this Mr. Gand-eye.

222
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:00,842
-Gandhi.
-Gandhi.

223
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,512
Of course.
We Westerners have a weakness...

224
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,599
...for these spiritually inclined
men of lndia.

225
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,727
But as an old lawyer,
let me warn you.

226
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,897
Mr. Gandhi is as shrewd a man
as you will ever meet...

227
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,775
...however otherworldly he may seem.

228
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,903
But l'm sure you're enough
of a reporter to see that.

229
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,906
I hope so.
Thank you for your time, sir.

230
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,996
So it's not spiritualism
or nationalism.

231
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:34,417
We're not resisting anything but the
idea that people can't live together.

232
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:35,835
You see?

233
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,421
Hindus, Muslims...

234
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:40,548
...Sikhs, Jews...

235
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,425
...even Christians.

236
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:45,053
Mr. Walker of the New York Times.

237
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,304
How you doing?

238
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,059
Without a paper,
a journal of some kind...

239
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,144
...you cannot unite a community.

240
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:56,481
You belong to a
very important profession.

241
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:02,529
And what do you think an important
professional should write...

242
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:06,282
...about your response to
General Smuts' newest legislation?

243
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,284
I don't know.

244
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,829
I'm still searching for a response.

245
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,872
You will respect the law?

246
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:18,461
There are unjust laws
as there are unjust men.

247
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,881
You're a small minority to take on
the South African government...

248
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:27,303
-...not to mention the British Empire.
-lf you are a minority of one...

249
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,931
...the truth is the truth.

250
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,059
Herman Kallenbach...

251
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:36,271
...our chief carpenter,
also our chief benefactor.

252
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,189
Vince Walker, New York Times.

253
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,358
This is quite a place
you've got here.

254
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,570
And you call it an ashram?

255
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,698
That's right.
The word only means "community."

256
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:50,201
But it could stand for
"village" or "the world."

257
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,704
You're an ambitious man, Mr. Gandhi.

258
00:22:52,955 --> 00:22:54,622
I hope not.

259
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:01,463
I hear that you also prepare
the meals and clean the toilets.

260
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,424
-ls that part of the experiment?
-Ba!

261
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,179
We will need another place set
for Mr. Walker's driver.

262
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,598
I will tell Tara.

263
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:17,312
Yes, it's one way to learn
that each man's labor...

264
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,272
...is as important as another's.

265
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:21,691
While you're doing it,
cleaning the toilet...

266
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:24,152
...seems far more important
than the law.

267
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,362
Please, come and join us.

268
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,365
You'll need something before
your journey back.

269
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,786
-Would you excuse me, please?
-Yeah, sure.

270
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,255
What is it?

271
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:47,967
Sora was sent to tell me l must...

272
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,428
...rake and cover the latrine.

273
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,848
That's right.
Everyone takes their turn.

274
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,642
It is the work of untouchables!

275
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,603
In this place,
there are no untouchables...

276
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:00,730
...and no work is beneath any of us.

277
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,690
I'm your wife!

278
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,651
All the more reason.

279
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,947
As you command.

280
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:15,286
The others may follow you,
but you forget...

281
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,956
...l knew you when you were a boy.

282
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:19,749
It's not me.

283
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,460
It's the principle.

284
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:26,381
And you will do it with joy
or not do it at all.

285
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,300
Not at all then.

286
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,348
All right then, go.
You don't belong here!

287
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:39,394
Go and leave the ashram altogether.
We don't want you!

288
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,354
Have you no shame?

289
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:43,022
I'm your wife!

290
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:57,453
Where do you expect me to go?

291
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,207
What's the matter with me?

292
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,466
You're human.

293
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,345
Only human.

294
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,933
And it's even harder
for those of us...

295
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:22,896
...who do not even want to be
as good as you do.

296
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,401
I apologize.

297
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,118
I must get back to that reporter.

298
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,413
And l must...

299
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:44,626
...rake and cover the latrine.

300
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,904
I want to welcome you all.

301
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,115
Every one of you.

302
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,702
We have no secrets.

303
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,837
Let us begin by being clear...

304
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,799
...about General Smuts' new law.

305
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,928
All Indians must now
be fingerprinted...

306
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,179
...like criminals.

307
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:40,098
Men and women.

308
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:44,352
No marriage other than a Christian
marriage is considered valid.

309
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,104
Under this act...

310
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,107
...our wives and mothers are whores.

311
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,986
And every man here is a bastard.

312
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,909
He has become quite good at this.

313
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,706
And a policeman...

314
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:08,209
...passing an Indian dwelling--

315
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,295
I will not call them homes.

316
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:14,465
--may enter and demand the card of
any lndian woman whose dwelling it is.

317
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,676
Goddamn them!

318
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:19,262
Understand...

319
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:23,224
...he does not have to
stand at the door.

320
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:25,852
He may enter.

321
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:27,395
I will not allow it!

322
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,398
I swear to Allah.

323
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:35,111
I'll kill the man who offers
that insult to my home and my wife...

324
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,031
...and let them hang me!

325
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:46,164
I say talk means nothing!

326
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:50,960
Kill a few officials before
they disgrace one lndian woman.

327
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:54,797
Then they might think twice
about such laws.

328
00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:59,052
In that cause,
I would be willing to die!

329
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:10,229
I praise such courage.

330
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,232
I need such courage...

331
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,736
...because, in this cause,
I too am prepared to die.

332
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:18,446
But, my friend...

333
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:23,826
...there is no cause for which
I am prepared to kill.

334
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,662
Whatever they do to us...

335
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,873
...we will attack no one...

336
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,042
...kill no one.

337
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:35,129
But we will not give
our fingerprints, not one of us.

338
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:40,093
They will imprison us. They will fine
us. They will seize our possessions.

339
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:43,596
But they cannot take away
our self-respect...

340
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,348
...if we do not give it to them.

341
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,558
Have you been to prison?

342
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:51,020
They beat us and torture us.
I say--

343
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,315
I am asking you to fight.

344
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:59,195
To fight against their anger,
not to provoke it.

345
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:04,325
We will not strike a blow.

346
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,495
But we will receive them.

347
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:09,205
And through our pain...

348
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,834
...we will make them see
their injustice.

349
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:14,710
And it will hurt...

350
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,338
...as all fighting hurts.

351
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,842
But we cannot lose.

352
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:23,177
We cannot.

353
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:27,432
They may torture my body...

354
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:30,309
...break my bones...

355
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,729
...even kill me. Then...

356
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,816
...they will have my dead body...

357
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,361
...not my obedience.

358
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,259
We are Hindu and Muslim...

359
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:06,846
...children of God, each one of us.

360
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:11,851
Let us take a solemn oath
in his name...

361
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,687
...that, come what may...

362
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:19,233
...we will not submit to this law.

363
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:04,946
God save our gracious King

364
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:10,284
God save our noble King

365
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:14,539
God save our King

366
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,102
These men are contracted laborers.

367
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:19,687
They belong in the mines.

368
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,356
You put their comrades in jail.

369
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:23,941
When you free them...

370
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,943
...they will go back to work.

371
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,195
I've warned you.

372
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,489
We've warned each other.

373
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,418
I don't think that's very good.

374
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,674
Steady, steady.

375
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,050
Stop!

376
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,939
At the canter, charge!

377
00:33:47,818 --> 00:33:50,069
We should lie down. Down!

378
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,073
The horses won't trample on us.
Lie down!

379
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:36,365
Follow me! Follow me!

380
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,262
Now what the hell do we do?

381
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,556
Let them march.

382
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:06,854
In our own sweet time,
in our own sweet way...

383
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,856
...we'll get them.

384
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,239
-One law!
-One king!

385
00:35:22,037 --> 00:35:26,081
Some of you may be rejoicing that
Mr. Gandhi has been put into prison.

386
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:31,003
But l would ask you, assembled
here in this house of God...

387
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:35,174
...to recognize that we are
witnessing something new...

388
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:38,636
...something so unexpected,
so unusual...

389
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:41,639
...that it is not surprising
the government is at a loss.

390
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:45,768
What Mr. Gandhi
has forced us to do...

391
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,646
...is ask questions about ourselves.

392
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:54,068
As Christians, those are
difficult questions to answer.

393
00:35:55,779 --> 00:36:00,741
How do we treat men
who defy an unjust law...

394
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,702
...who will not fight...

395
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,539
...but will not comply?

396
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:10,084
As Christians, or as people
who have not heard the word--

397
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,475
They're sparing no one, l see.

398
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:30,688
No, you were the surprise.

399
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,940
It has been all over the prison.

400
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:35,609
We thought they'd be too afraid
of the English press.

401
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,486
So did l.

402
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,915
I don't know who they've
left out there to do the work.

403
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:54,461
-Have they touched the women?
-My wife publicly defied the law.

404
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,839
They've arrested her and four others.

405
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,966
It split the government.

406
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,677
Well, that's one victory.

407
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:05,431
If we hold firm,
it won't be the last.

408
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,724
Don't worry.

409
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,768
I've never seen men so determined.

410
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,313
You have given them a way to fight.

411
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:18,569
Gandhi!

412
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:20,613
I want Gandhi!

413
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:22,781
Which Sammy is it?

414
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,532
Mr. Gandhi.

415
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,620
I thought we might have
a little talk.

416
00:38:11,206 --> 00:38:12,748
Thank you, Daniels.

417
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,003
Will you have a glass of sherry?

418
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:20,172
Thank you, no.

419
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,676
-Perhaps some tea?
-l dined at the prison.

420
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:30,933
Please, do come and sit down.

421
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:45,823
Mr. Gandhi.

422
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:50,536
I've more or less decided to ask
the House to repeal the act...

423
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,247
...that you have taken
such exception to.

424
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:58,043
Well, if you asked, General Smuts,
I'm sure it will be done.

425
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,546
It's not quite that simple.

426
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,840
Somehow, I expected not.

427
00:39:03,091 --> 00:39:05,843
I thought of calling for
a royal commission...

428
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,262
...to investigate the new legislation.

429
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:12,516
I think I could guarantee they would
recommend the act be repealed.

430
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,727
I congratulate them.

431
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,520
But they might also recommend...

432
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:21,066
...that all future lndian immigration
be severely restricted...

433
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,485
...even stopped.

434
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,998
Immigration was not an issue
on which we fought.

435
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,543
It would be wrong of us
to make it one, now that we....

436
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:43,630
We are in a position of advantage.

437
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,099
I'm ordering the release of all
prisoners within the next 24 hours.

438
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,936
You yourself are free
as from this moment.

439
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,030
Assuming we are in agreement.

440
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,449
Yes, yes.

441
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:15,245
It's just that in these clothes,
I would prefer to go by taxi.

442
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,622
All right. Fine.

443
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,459
I'm afraid I have no money.

444
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,213
Neither have l.

445
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:27,716
I'm awfully sorry.

446
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,176
Daniels...

447
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,513
...will you lend Mr. Gandhi
a shilling for a taxi?

448
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,807
I beg your pardon, sir?

449
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,935
How far will you be going, Gandhi?

450
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:42,731
Now that this is settled, l'd thought
seriously of going back to lndia.

451
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,819
But a shilling will do splendidly
for the moment.

452
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,453
Thank you.

453
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,336
I'm obliged, Mr. Daniels...

454
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,172
...but l can find my own way out.

455
00:41:24,399 --> 00:41:28,652
Guard of honor!

456
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,696
Attention!

457
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:46,253
Present arms!

458
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:54,469
-My God, he loves it!
-l'm sure he hates it.

459
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,931
Generals' reputations are
being made in France today...

460
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,808
...fighting on the Western front.

461
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:04,021
Not as military governors in lndia.

462
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,733
What the devil's going on back there?

463
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:10,777
Must be that lndian who made
all that fuss in Africa.

464
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,946
My cabin boy told me he was onboard.

465
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,532
There he is.

466
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:20,370
God, he's dressed like a coolie!

467
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,164
I thought he was a lawyer.

468
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,959
Mr. Gandhi, have you refused
to wear European clothes?

469
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,794
No, I haven't refused.

470
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:31,131
I simply wanted to dress the way
my comrades in prison dress.

471
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,091
Will you support the war effort?

472
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:38,138
If l wish to enjoy the benefits
and protection of the British Empire...

473
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:41,892
...it would be wrong of me
not to help in its defense.

474
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,353
Now that you're back in lndia,
what will you do?

475
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,854
I don't know.

476
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,856
-l don't know.
-One more question.

477
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,818
As an lndian woman, how could you
accept the indignity of prison?

478
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,072
My dignity comes
from following my husband.

479
00:42:55,323 --> 00:42:56,615
Thank you very much.

480
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,250
Just a few words, then we'll
get you to civilization.

481
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:07,626
May I?

482
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,847
I'm glad to be home...

483
00:43:26,396 --> 00:43:28,313
...and l thank you for your greeting.

484
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,458
I'll follow with your wife.

485
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:50,419
Don't worry.
Everything's arranged.

486
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:57,050
-Who's that young man?
-That's young Nehru.

487
00:43:57,218 --> 00:44:00,053
He's got his father's intellect,
his mother's good looks...

488
00:44:00,221 --> 00:44:01,596
...and the devil's own charm.

489
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:05,392
If they don't ruin him at Cambridge--
Wave, wave!

490
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,561
--he might amount to something.

491
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:17,904
I must say, when l first saw you as
a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay...

492
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,615
...l never thought l'd greet you
as a national hero.

493
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,534
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.

494
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,411
Yes, you are!

495
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,539
It's been 200 years
since an Indian cocked a snook...

496
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:30,042
...at the British Empire
and got away with it.

497
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:34,963
And stop calling me Mr. Patel.
You're not a junior clerk anymore.

498
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:04,034
The new military governor of the
Northwest Province was on that ship.

499
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:06,536
Too bad you came back third class.

500
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,205
He might have been impressed...

501
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:11,917
...by a successful barrister
who'd outmaneuvered General Smuts.

502
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:14,878
Yes, l'm sure.

503
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:28,350
Are you involved too, Mrs. Nehru?

504
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:32,813
No. I leave practical matters
to my husband...

505
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:35,357
...and revolution to my son.

506
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:39,319
Mr. Gandhi, l'd like you to meet
Mr. Jinnah, our joint host...

507
00:45:39,487 --> 00:45:41,863
...member of congress and leader
of the Muslim League.

508
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:43,365
How do you do?

509
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:45,742
And Mr. Prakash, who, l fear...

510
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:49,287
...is awaiting trial for sedition
and inducement to murder.

511
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:52,916
I have not actually pulled
the trigger, Mr. Gandhi.

512
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,376
I have simply written...

513
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,921
...if an Englishman kills an Indian
for disobeying his law...

514
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,424
...it is an lndian's duty
to kill an Englishman...

515
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,968
...for enforcing his law
in a land that is not his.

516
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:06,763
It's a clever argument. lt may not
produce the end you desire.

517
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:11,351
We hope you'll join us in our
struggle for home rule, Mr. Gandhi.

518
00:46:11,561 --> 00:46:15,605
Excuse me. May l, Mohan?
There's someone I'd like him to meet.

519
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:16,898
Excuse me.

520
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,735
Sorry to rush you.

521
00:46:22,113 --> 00:46:24,656
He told the press
he'd support the British in the war.

522
00:46:24,866 --> 00:46:26,575
That's nonviolence for you.

523
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,744
You know, Mohan...

524
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,080
...now l have a confession to make.

525
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,041
I didn't decide to come
to South Africa.

526
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,252
Professor Gokhale sent me.

527
00:46:39,005 --> 00:46:41,381
We are trying
to make a nation, Gandhi.

528
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,301
But the British keep trying
to break us up...

529
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:48,263
...into religions,
principalities, provinces.

530
00:46:49,098 --> 00:46:51,600
What you were writing
in South Africa...

531
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:53,351
...that's what we need here.

532
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:55,812
I have so much to learn about India.

533
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:59,983
And l have to begin my practice again.
One needs money to run a journal.

534
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,570
Nonsense. Go on, Charlie.
This is lndian talk.

535
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,740
We want none of
you imperialists here.

536
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,744
All right, l'll go
and write my report to the viceroy.

537
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:13,413
You go and find
a pretty Hindu woman...

538
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,540
...and convert her to Christianity.

539
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,543
That's as much mischief
as you're allowed.

540
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,672
Come, let's find a quiet corner.

541
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,635
Now, you forget about your practice.

542
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,929
You have other things to do.

543
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:33,350
India has many men
with too much wealth.

544
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:37,729
And it's their privilege to nourish
the effort of the few...

545
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,816
...who can raise lndia
from servitude and apathy.

546
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,735
I'll see to it.

547
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,529
You begin your journal.

548
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,030
I have little to say.

549
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,115
Come, let's sit down.

550
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:51,368
India is an alien country to me.

551
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:52,994
Change that.

552
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,456
Go and find lndia.

553
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,083
Not what you see here...

554
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,877
...but the real India.

555
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,964
You'll see what needs to be said...

556
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:06,967
...what we need to hear.

557
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,850
When I saw you in that tunic, l knew.

558
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,772
I knew l could die in peace.

559
00:48:22,191 --> 00:48:24,985
Make India proud of herself.

560
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:54,444
Charlie, please.
You're both being foolish.

561
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,739
But the air is lovely.
Anyway, there's no room in there.

562
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,492
Please! Come in.

563
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,494
No violence, please.

564
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:06,039
Let me hang on with two hands
or l will fall.

565
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,582
Englishman, sahib!

566
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,709
Come, there is room up here!

567
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,381
Put your foot on the window. Come!

568
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:25,517
-What are you doing?
-l'm going nearer to God.

569
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,479
Charlie! Be careful!

570
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:31,898
Let go. Let go!

571
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:34,442
-Let go!
-Oh, dear!

572
00:52:47,248 --> 00:52:49,123
Hello.

573
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,086
You see?
It is most comfortable.

574
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:54,712
Sahib?

575
00:52:55,923 --> 00:52:56,965
Are you a Christian?

576
00:52:57,842 --> 00:52:59,425
Yes, l'm a Christian.

577
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:01,219
I know a Christian.

578
00:53:01,971 --> 00:53:03,888
She drinks blood.

579
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:07,141
Blood of Christ. Every Sunday.

580
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:13,523
Charlie!

581
00:53:17,111 --> 00:53:19,112
It's all right, sahib.
It's very safe.

582
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,197
Bend!

583
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:28,663
Pray to God, sahib.
Now is when it is best to be Hindu.

584
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:31,624
I agree with Jinnah.

585
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:35,837
Now that the Americans are in,
the war will be over soon.

586
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:38,506
The Germans are worn out as it is.

587
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:41,050
And our first act should be...

588
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,345
...to convene
a congress party convention...

589
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:47,056
...and demand independence.

590
00:53:47,308 --> 00:53:50,476
And we will speak
with one voice, united.

591
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,855
And we should invite Gandhi.

592
00:53:54,106 --> 00:53:55,857
What the devil's happened to him?

593
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:58,234
He's discovering lndia.

594
00:53:58,444 --> 00:54:01,195
Which is better than
making trouble where it matters.

595
00:54:01,447 --> 00:54:04,407
Invite him, let him say his piece
about South Africa...

596
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,826
...then let him slip into oblivion.

597
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:38,191
Insurgents.

598
00:54:38,484 --> 00:54:40,109
They've derailed a troop train.

599
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,529
Keep clear! Come on.

600
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,913
They've killed an English soldier.

601
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,590
We were asked for toleration.

602
00:55:03,092 --> 00:55:05,885
We were asked for patience.

603
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,054
Some of us gave it...

604
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,431
...and some did not.

605
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:14,310
Well, their war is over.

606
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,730
And those of us who supported it...

607
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,483
...and those of us who refused...

608
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:24,070
...must forget our differences.

609
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,615
And there can be no excuses...

610
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:30,118
...from the British now.

611
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:32,245
India wants...

612
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:33,871
...home rule.

613
00:55:34,123 --> 00:55:35,206
India...

614
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:37,458
...demands home rule!

615
00:55:53,934 --> 00:55:55,643
Congratulations.

616
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,740
And let no one question...

617
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,950
...that Mr. Jinnah speaks...

618
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,369
...not just for the Muslims...

619
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,662
...but for all lndia!

620
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,087
And now...

621
00:56:23,297 --> 00:56:25,631
...l'm going to introduce to you...

622
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,800
...a man whose writings...

623
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:30,136
...we are all becoming familiar with.

624
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:34,474
A man who stood in high esteem
with our own beloved Gokhale.

625
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:37,393
A man whose accomplishments
in South Africa...

626
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,145
...will always be remembered.

627
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:41,439
Mr. Mohandas Gandhi!

628
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:45,693
Your journal has made great impact.

629
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,237
I'm flattered by Mr. Patel.

630
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:51,532
I would be even more flattered
if what he said were true.

631
00:56:51,784 --> 00:56:52,992
But it is true.

632
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:55,620
I read it. Often!

633
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:11,052
Since I returned from South Africa...

634
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:15,973
...l've traveled over much of India.

635
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:20,728
And l know that l could travel
for many more years...

636
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:24,190
...and still only see
a small part of her.

637
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:27,068
And yet, l already know...

638
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:29,195
...that what we say here...

639
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:33,241
...means nothing to
the masses of our country.

640
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:37,411
Here, we make speeches
for each other...

641
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:42,208
...and those English liberal magazines
that may grant us a few lines.

642
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,879
But the people of lndia...

643
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:48,422
...are...

644
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:50,424
...untouched.

645
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:54,554
Their politics are confined to bread...

646
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,222
...and salt.

647
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,850
Illiterate they may be,
but they're not blind.

648
00:57:59,101 --> 00:58:02,353
They see no reason to give their
loyalty to rich and powerful men...

649
00:58:02,646 --> 00:58:05,731
...who simply want to take over
the role of the British...

650
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:07,775
...in the name of freedom.

651
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,321
This congress tells the world...

652
00:58:12,531 --> 00:58:14,699
...it represents lndia.

653
00:58:15,784 --> 00:58:17,076
My brothers...

654
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:18,619
...lndia...

655
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:22,331
...is 700,000 villages...

656
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:26,377
...not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi...

657
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:28,129
...and Bombay.

658
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,549
Until we stand in the fields...

659
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:35,678
...with the millions that toil
each day under the hot sun...

660
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:39,724
...we will not represent India.

661
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:43,644
Nor will we ever be able
to challenge the British...

662
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,938
...as one nation.

663
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:04,790
Have you read his magazine?

664
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:06,542
No.

665
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,878
But l think I'm going to.

666
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:14,926
Pull over.

667
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:16,719
This can't be the way.

668
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:20,640
Yes, l'm sure this is
the direction lndia is taking.

669
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,644
To think I almost got
excited by Mr. Jinnah...

670
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:26,938
...when all this was awaiting me.

671
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:47,917
We're looking for Mr. Gandhi.

672
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,547
-You'll find him under that tree.
-Thank you.

673
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:57,009
I'm anxious to meet this new force.

674
00:59:57,469 --> 01:00:00,638
I try to live like an Indian,
as you see.

675
01:00:00,889 --> 01:00:02,932
It's stupid, of course.

676
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:04,725
Because in our country...

677
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:07,478
...it is the British who decide
how an lndian lives...

678
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:10,606
...what he may buy, what he may sell.

679
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,608
And from their luxury...

680
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:16,612
...in the midst
of our terrible poverty...

681
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:21,158
...they instruct us on
what is justice, what is sedition.

682
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:25,413
So it's only natural
that our best young minds...

683
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:28,499
...assume an air of Eastern dignity...

684
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,418
...while greedily assimilating...

685
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:34,463
...every Western weakness as quickly
as they can acquire it.

686
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,510
If we have home rule...

687
01:00:40,262 --> 01:00:41,345
...that'll change.

688
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,351
Would you, please?

689
01:00:48,437 --> 01:00:51,063
Why should the British
grant us home rule?

690
01:00:53,025 --> 01:00:55,609
We must take
the peelings to the goats.

691
01:00:56,194 --> 01:01:00,614
We only make wild speeches or
perform even wilder acts of terrorism.

692
01:01:00,949 --> 01:01:02,616
We've bred an army of anarchists...

693
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:06,078
...but not one group that can
fight the British anywhere.

694
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,205
Hello! Hello!

695
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,291
But l thought you were
against fighting.

696
01:01:10,542 --> 01:01:13,711
Now just spread it around.

697
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,463
There you are.

698
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:19,508
They like the new peelings
mixed in with the rotting ones.

699
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,805
Where there's injustice,
I always believed in fighting.

700
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,393
The question is, do you fight
to change things or to punish?

701
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:33,439
I've found we're all such sinners,
we should leave punishment to God.

702
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:36,317
And if we really want
to change things...

703
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:39,070
...there are better ways
of doing it...

704
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:42,698
...than derailing trains
or slashing someone with a sword.

705
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:44,658
The fire is ready.

706
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,912
You see, even here...

707
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,915
...we live under tyranny.

708
01:01:57,464 --> 01:02:00,216
What did l tell you?
Look at him!

709
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:03,344
I can see the British shaking now.

710
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,655
Hello!

711
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:25,741
I'm looking for Mr. Gandhi.

712
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:31,414
I've been trying to speak
to you for a long time.

713
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,334
Our crops.

714
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,336
We cannot sell them.

715
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:40,047
We have no money.

716
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:43,384
But the landlords still
demand the same rent.

717
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:47,430
We have nothing left.

718
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:33,309
Mr. Taylor, sir. Up here!

719
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:46,906
Jesus!

720
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,909
What the hell is going on?

721
01:03:50,619 --> 01:03:52,286
I don't know, sir.

722
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:58,751
The agent got a telegram.

723
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,713
And it just said, "He is coming,"
and gave the time of the train.

724
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:10,846
Who the hell is "he"?

725
01:04:12,057 --> 01:04:13,098
I don't know, sir.

726
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:39,250
Out of the way.
Come on, you!

727
01:04:44,214 --> 01:04:48,300
-Who the devil are you?
-My name is Mohandas K. Gandhi.

728
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:50,344
Whoever you are,
we don't want you here.

729
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:53,597
I suggest you get back on
that train before it leaves.

730
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:55,724
They seem to want me.

731
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:57,017
Now, look here.

732
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:59,270
I'll put you under arrest
if you'd prefer.

733
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,397
On what charge?

734
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:07,361
I don't want any trouble.

735
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:12,199
I'm an lndian traveling in my own
country. I see no reason for trouble.

736
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:16,954
Well, there had better not be.

737
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,210
Make way for the officer.

738
01:05:42,647 --> 01:05:44,273
For years...

739
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:47,026
...the landlords have ordered us...

740
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:48,569
...to grow indigo...

741
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:50,779
...for dyeing cloth.

742
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:55,534
Always, they took part
of the crop as rent.

743
01:05:56,536 --> 01:05:57,620
But now...

744
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:02,249
...everyone buys their cloth
from England.

745
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:03,667
So no one wants...

746
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:06,378
...our indigo.

747
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,047
The landlords...

748
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:11,133
...say we must pay our rent...

749
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:12,801
...in cash.

750
01:06:14,763 --> 01:06:16,180
What we could...

751
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,265
...we sold.

752
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:21,310
The police have taken the rest.

753
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:23,312
There is...

754
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,564
...no food.

755
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,692
I understand.

756
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:32,529
The landlords are British?

757
01:06:43,041 --> 01:06:44,958
What we can do, we will try to do.

758
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:06,605
Shukla...

759
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:08,941
...is all Champaran like this?

760
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:11,068
Yes, Bapu.

761
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:13,070
The whole region.

762
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:15,948
Hundreds. Thousands.

763
01:07:18,618 --> 01:07:20,953
Some landlords have tried to help.

764
01:07:21,454 --> 01:07:23,330
But what can they do?

765
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:41,014
-Are you Mr. M.K. Gandhi?
-Yes.

766
01:07:41,224 --> 01:07:43,267
I'm sorry, you're under arrest.

767
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:45,519
I'm not sorry at all.

768
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,365
Who did you say
would be buying the drinks?

769
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:03,287
Oh, no!

770
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:13,380
Wouldn't you know, that's the best
innings I've had since Oxford.

771
01:08:13,673 --> 01:08:16,508
-lndia's full of grief, old man.
-l've got no idea.

772
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:20,345
All I know is there's a riot or
something at Motihari in Champaran.

773
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:22,055
The whole company's ordered out.

774
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:41,658
I would like to see the prisoner.

775
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,297
On the left, sir.

776
01:09:03,515 --> 01:09:06,809
-Charlie.
-Shades of South Africa.

777
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,143
Not quite.

778
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,103
They're only holding me...

779
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:12,439
...until the magistrate's hearing.

780
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,691
Then it will be prison.

781
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,112
Did they take your clothes?

782
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,407
These are my clothes now.

783
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:27,496
You always had
a puritanical streak, Mohan.

784
01:09:28,248 --> 01:09:30,082
If l want to be one with them...

785
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,042
...l have to live like them.

786
01:09:32,252 --> 01:09:33,585
Yes, l think you do.

787
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,880
But thank God we all don't.

788
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,091
My puritanism runs in a different way.

789
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:41,301
I'm far too modest for such a display.

790
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:50,769
Couldn't I be let in with
the prisoner? I am a clergyman.

791
01:10:04,409 --> 01:10:05,909
They're calling you "Bapu."

792
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:07,828
I thought it meant "father."

793
01:10:08,496 --> 01:10:09,955
It does.

794
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:13,000
We must be getting old, Charlie.

795
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:17,546
What do you want me to do?

796
01:10:21,092 --> 01:10:22,801
I think that you can help us most...

797
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:26,430
...by taking that assignment
you've been offered in Fiji.

798
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:31,518
I have to be sure--

799
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:34,187
They have to be sure
that what we do...

800
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:37,649
...can be done by Indians alone.

801
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:51,038
But you know the strategy.

802
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,541
The world is full of people who
will despise what's happening here.

803
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:56,501
It is their strength that we need.

804
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:58,086
Before you go...

805
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:02,299
...you could start us
in the right direction.

806
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:13,894
I must leave from Calcutta...

807
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:16,688
...and soon.

808
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:21,109
Say goodbye to Ba for me.

809
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:27,199
Well, l....

810
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:31,328
There are no goodbyes for us, Charlie.

811
01:11:32,372 --> 01:11:35,457
Wherever you are,
you will always be in my heart.

812
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:59,856
-l'm going to clear the courtroom.
-l'm not sure we'd be able to.

813
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:02,401
It is a first hearing.
It's supposed to be public.

814
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:04,444
And he's a lawyer.

815
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:07,489
I don't know where
they found the nerve.

816
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:10,659
I don't either, but the troops
won't be here till tomorrow.

817
01:12:10,994 --> 01:12:13,328
How did the press get here
before the military?

818
01:12:13,621 --> 01:12:16,456
That English clergyman sent
a number of telegrams yesterday.

819
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:19,876
I understand one of them
even went to the viceroy.

820
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,183
You have been ordered
out of the province...

821
01:12:35,435 --> 01:12:37,978
...on the grounds of
disturbing the peace.

822
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:46,778
With respect, l refuse to go.

823
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:52,034
Do you want to go to jail?

824
01:12:52,285 --> 01:12:53,493
As you wish.

825
01:12:58,916 --> 01:12:59,958
All right.

826
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:02,878
I will release you on bail...

827
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:07,007
...of 1 00 rupees
until I reach a sentence.

828
01:13:09,927 --> 01:13:12,137
I refuse to pay 1 00 rupees.

829
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:24,483
Then l will grant release on bail...

830
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:28,487
...without payment
until I reach a decision.

831
01:13:54,764 --> 01:13:55,889
Gandhiji! Gandhiji!

832
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:03,688
We are from Bihar.

833
01:14:04,232 --> 01:14:06,441
We received a cable
from an old friend...

834
01:14:06,651 --> 01:14:08,360
...who was at Cambridge with us.

835
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:09,903
His name is Nehru.

836
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:12,197
-l believe you know him.
-lndeed.

837
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:15,867
He tells us you need help,
and we have come to give it.

838
01:14:17,912 --> 01:14:22,499
I want to document coldly, rationally,
what is being done here.

839
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,084
It may take months.

840
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:25,877
We have no pressing engagements.

841
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:28,755
You will have to live
with the peasants.

842
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,049
There will be risks.

843
01:14:50,027 --> 01:14:52,028
I don't know what
this country's coming to.

844
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:53,321
But good God, man!

845
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:57,242
You yourself raised the rent simply
to finance a hunting expedition.

846
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:01,788
And some of these others:
beatings, illegal seizures...

847
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:04,082
...demanding services without pay.

848
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,668
Even refusing them water.

849
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,628
In lndia!

850
01:15:08,796 --> 01:15:11,631
Nobody knows what it is to try
to get these people to work.

851
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:13,925
You've made this half-naked
whatever-he-is...

852
01:15:14,093 --> 01:15:16,469
...into an international hero.

853
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:20,765
"One lone man, marching dusty roads,
armed only with honesty...

854
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:24,477
...and a bamboo staff, doing battle
with the British Empire."

855
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:27,981
At home, children are
writing essays about him.

856
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:32,360
What do they want?

857
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:33,820
Gareth!

858
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:36,531
Yes, sir.

859
01:15:36,782 --> 01:15:38,950
There's a rebate on rents paid.

860
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:41,953
They're to be free to grow crops
of their own choice.

861
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:46,541
And a commission, part lndian,
to hear grievances.

862
01:15:49,921 --> 01:15:52,923
That would satisfy him?

863
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:54,925
And His Majesty's government.

864
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:58,345
It only needs your signature
for the landlords.

865
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,898
It'll be worth it
to see the back of him.

866
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:14,903
Thank you, sir.

867
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:18,990
-We're too damned liberal.
-Perhaps.

868
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:24,079
At least this has made the government
see some sense about what men...

869
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:27,916
...like Mr. Gandhi should be allowed,
and what they should be denied.

870
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,724
Where is Mr. Gandhi?

871
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:47,769
He said he preferred to walk, sir.

872
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:51,815
I followed him most of the way.
He's just turned the corner.

873
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:54,317
He came third class.

874
01:16:55,194 --> 01:16:57,862
God, give me patience.

875
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:04,661
My house is honored.

876
01:17:04,912 --> 01:17:06,454
The honor is ours.

877
01:17:06,664 --> 01:17:09,374
I'd like you to meet
Dr. Kallenbach, an old friend.

878
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:13,712
He's interested in flowers. l told
him he could wander your garden.

879
01:17:14,213 --> 01:17:17,173
I'll send for my gardener.
You'll have plenty to discuss.

880
01:17:17,425 --> 01:17:18,925
Thank you.

881
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:25,515
Gentlemen, the hero of Champaran.

882
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:28,101
Only the stubborn man of Champaran.

883
01:17:28,352 --> 01:17:30,437
Mr. Patel you know.

884
01:17:30,688 --> 01:17:33,273
Maulana Azad, my colleague
and a fellow Muslim...

885
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,318
...and just recently
released from prison.

886
01:17:38,195 --> 01:17:39,571
Mr. Kripalani.

887
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:43,950
And of course, you know Mr. Nehru.

888
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:47,078
I'm beginning to know Mr. Nehru.

889
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,414
Please sit down. Do sit down.

890
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:54,044
Gentlemen, l've asked you to come
here through Mr. Jinnah's kindness...

891
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:57,088
...because I've had the chance
to see the legislation.

892
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:59,466
And it is exactly as was rumored.

893
01:17:59,884 --> 01:18:03,219
Arrest without warrant,
and automatic imprisonment...

894
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:06,014
...for possession of materials
considered seditious.

895
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:09,768
And your writings
are specifically listed.

896
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:12,312
So much for helping them
in the Great War.

897
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:16,149
There is only one answer.
Direct action on a scale...

898
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,151
...they can never handle.

899
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:20,612
I don't think so.

900
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:24,616
Terrorism would only justify
their repression.

901
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:27,952
And what kind of leaders
would it throw up?

902
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:32,040
Are they men that we'd want
at the head of our country?

903
01:18:32,291 --> 01:18:35,335
I too have read
Mr. Gandhi's writings...

904
01:18:35,586 --> 01:18:39,214
...but l'd rather be ruled by an
Indian terrorist than an English one.

905
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:41,800
And l don't intend to submit
to that kind of law.

906
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:44,135
I must say, it seems to me...

907
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:49,224
...that it's gone beyond remedies
like passive resistance.

908
01:18:50,101 --> 01:18:51,351
If l may...

909
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:55,063
...l, for one, have never
advocated passive anything.

910
01:18:57,608 --> 01:19:01,069
I'm with Mr. Jinnah.
We must never submit to such laws...

911
01:19:01,529 --> 01:19:02,779
...ever.

912
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:08,952
And l think our resistance must be
active and provocative.

913
01:19:11,205 --> 01:19:12,247
May I?

914
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:18,253
I want to embarrass all those
who wish to treat us as slaves.

915
01:19:19,964 --> 01:19:21,339
Thank you.

916
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,344
All of them.

917
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:29,264
-Forgive my stupid illustration.
-Allow me.

918
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:31,182
No, please.

919
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:33,518
But l want to change their minds...

920
01:19:33,727 --> 01:19:37,188
...not kill them
for weaknesses we all possess.

921
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,360
And what resistance would you offer?

922
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:46,781
The law is due
to take effect from April 6.

923
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:48,950
I want to call upon the nation...

924
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:52,996
...to make that a day of
prayer and fasting.

925
01:19:53,247 --> 01:19:54,330
A general strike?

926
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:58,376
I mean a day of prayer and fasting.

927
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:02,088
Of course, no work could be done.
No buses.

928
01:20:03,090 --> 01:20:04,340
No trains.

929
01:20:04,592 --> 01:20:06,009
No factories.

930
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:07,844
No administration.

931
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:10,763
The country would stop.

932
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:14,767
My God, it would terrify them!

933
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:17,812
350 million people at prayer?

934
01:20:18,522 --> 01:20:21,232
Even the English newspapers
would have to report that...

935
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:23,276
...and explain why.

936
01:20:23,527 --> 01:20:26,070
-But could we get people to do it?
-Why not?

937
01:20:26,989 --> 01:20:29,324
Champaran stirred the whole country.

938
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:32,452
Thank you.

939
01:20:32,953 --> 01:20:34,871
They're calling you "Mahatma."

940
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:37,248
"Great Soul."

941
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:42,462
Fortunately, such news comes
very slowly to where l live.

942
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:47,717
I think if we all worked
to publicize it...

943
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:49,177
...all of congress...

944
01:20:49,762 --> 01:20:51,513
...every avenue we know....

945
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:56,226
I could get articles printed in most
of the papers in Delhi and Bombay.

946
01:21:06,904 --> 01:21:09,989
Only civilians will visit.
Don't you think so, Your Highness?

947
01:21:10,199 --> 01:21:13,076
Of course, the army will
always be loyal.

948
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:16,162
I'll have you know,
we've got 500 troops.

949
01:21:19,458 --> 01:21:23,253
They'll be damn hungry by morning,
I'll tell you that.

950
01:21:28,259 --> 01:21:31,678
Excuse me, Your Excellency.
Mr. Kinnoch.

951
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:34,347
Sir, l'm afraid it's confirmed.

952
01:21:35,432 --> 01:21:36,724
Nothing's working, sir.

953
01:21:36,976 --> 01:21:39,644
The buses, the trains, the markets.

954
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:42,772
There's not even any ordinary
civilian staff here, sir.

955
01:21:43,107 --> 01:21:45,567
Is it simply Delhi and Bombay?

956
01:21:45,818 --> 01:21:49,028
Karachi, Calcutta, Madras, Bangalore.
It's total.

957
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:52,282
The army had to take over
the telegraph...

958
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:55,368
...or we'd be cut off from the world.

959
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:02,792
I can't believe it.

960
01:22:03,002 --> 01:22:05,712
He's going to sell his own paper
tomorrow in Bombay, sir.

961
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:09,215
They've called for a parade
on Victoria Road.

962
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,009
Arrest him.

963
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:20,685
He's to go to the visitors' room.

964
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:40,204
Bapu.

965
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:42,790
You too?

966
01:22:44,126 --> 01:22:47,170
It seems less formal than Mahatma.

967
01:22:55,554 --> 01:22:58,890
Since your arrest,
the riots have hardly stopped.

968
01:22:59,558 --> 01:23:01,976
Not big, but they keep breaking out.

969
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:03,728
I want to stop them.

970
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:08,650
And Patel and Kripalani,
they're never at rest.

971
01:23:09,777 --> 01:23:13,446
But some English civilians
have been killed.

972
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:19,410
And the army is attacking
crowds with clubs.

973
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:22,955
Sometimes worse.

974
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:30,755
Maybe I'm wrong.

975
01:23:31,465 --> 01:23:33,800
Maybe we're not ready yet.

976
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:37,428
In South Africa,
our numbers were small.

977
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:45,978
The government's afraid.
They don't know what to do.

978
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:49,315
They're more afraid
of terrorism than of you.

979
01:23:49,817 --> 01:23:54,153
The viceroy's agreed to your release
if you will speak for nonviolence.

980
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:59,909
I've never spoken for anything else.

981
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:27,103
England...

982
01:24:27,438 --> 01:24:29,105
...is so powerful.

983
01:24:29,982 --> 01:24:31,190
Its army...

984
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,608
...and its navy...

985
01:24:33,402 --> 01:24:35,403
...all its modern weapons....

986
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:38,656
But when a great power like that...

987
01:24:39,616 --> 01:24:41,701
...strikes defenseless people...

988
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:45,371
...it shows its brutality...

989
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:46,664
...its own weakness.

990
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:49,751
Especially when those people
do not strike back.

991
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:20,907
Fighting back will not work.

992
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:23,367
And that is why the Mahatma...

993
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:27,163
...begs us to take
the course of nonviolence.

994
01:25:58,362 --> 01:26:01,113
Back away! Back away!

995
01:26:10,791 --> 01:26:12,375
But if we riot...

996
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,585
...if we fight back...

997
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:18,005
...we become the vandals...

998
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:19,674
...and they become the law.

999
01:26:20,759 --> 01:26:25,304
If we bear their blows,
they are the vandals.

1000
01:26:26,557 --> 01:26:28,933
God and his law are on our--

1001
01:26:59,256 --> 01:27:01,799
Front rank, kneel in position!

1002
01:27:05,095 --> 01:27:06,596
We...

1003
01:27:07,014 --> 01:27:09,348
...must have the courage...

1004
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,809
...to take their anger.

1005
01:27:25,032 --> 01:27:26,866
Should we issue a warning, sir?

1006
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:30,995
They've had their warning:

1007
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:33,497
No meetings.

1008
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:39,211
Fire!

1009
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:13,287
Take your time!

1010
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:36,185
Corporal!

1011
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:37,979
To your left.

1012
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:27,987
General Dyer...

1013
01:29:29,156 --> 01:29:31,907
...is it correct that you ordered
your troops to fire...

1014
01:29:32,117 --> 01:29:34,493
...at the thickest part of the crowd?

1015
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:36,871
That is so.

1016
01:29:41,752 --> 01:29:44,754
1 51 6 casualties with...

1017
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:49,884
...1 650 bullets.

1018
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:52,136
My intention was
to inflict a lesson...

1019
01:29:52,304 --> 01:29:55,264
...that would have an impact
throughout all lndia.

1020
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:01,729
General...

1021
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:07,151
...had you been able to
take in the armored car...

1022
01:30:07,778 --> 01:30:10,237
...would you have opened fire
with the machine gun?

1023
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:16,160
I think, probably, yes.

1024
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:23,959
General, did you realize there were
children and women in the crowd?

1025
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:26,754
I did.

1026
01:30:27,714 --> 01:30:30,424
But that was irrelevant
to the point you were making?

1027
01:30:30,675 --> 01:30:32,301
That is correct.

1028
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:42,770
Could l ask you what provision
you made for the wounded?

1029
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:49,110
I was ready to help any who applied.

1030
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:54,240
General, how does a child...

1031
01:30:54,741 --> 01:30:57,284
...shot with a .303 Lee-Enfield...

1032
01:30:58,120 --> 01:31:00,287
...apply for help?

1033
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:49,683
Forgive me, gentlemen,
but you must understand...

1034
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:54,938
...that His Majesty's government
and the British people repudiate...

1035
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:59,485
...both the massacre and
the philosophy that prompted it.

1036
01:34:59,944 --> 01:35:01,320
Now...

1037
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:03,530
...what l would like to do...

1038
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:08,369
...is to come to some compromise
over the new--

1039
01:35:08,578 --> 01:35:11,080
If you will excuse me,
Your Excellency...

1040
01:35:11,331 --> 01:35:14,500
...it is our view that matters
have gone beyond legislation.

1041
01:35:15,043 --> 01:35:16,835
We think it is time you recognized...

1042
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:20,130
...that you are masters
in someone else's home.

1043
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:24,468
Despite the best intentions
of the best of you...

1044
01:35:24,636 --> 01:35:28,680
...you must, in the nature of things,
humiliate us to control us.

1045
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:33,685
General Dyer is but
an extreme example of the principle.

1046
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:36,397
It is time you left.

1047
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:42,986
With respect, Mr. Gandhi...

1048
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:45,364
...without British administration...

1049
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:47,616
...this country would be
reduced to chaos.

1050
01:35:47,951 --> 01:35:49,243
Mr. Kinnoch...

1051
01:35:51,287 --> 01:35:53,664
...l beg you to accept
that there is no people...

1052
01:35:53,832 --> 01:35:56,250
...who would not prefer
their own bad government...

1053
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:58,752
...to the good government
of an alien power.

1054
01:35:58,962 --> 01:36:01,755
My dear sir, India is British.

1055
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:04,299
We're hardly an alien power.

1056
01:36:10,473 --> 01:36:11,557
Mr. Gandhi.

1057
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:16,687
Even if His Majesty could waive
all other considerations...

1058
01:36:16,938 --> 01:36:21,024
...he has a duty to the millions
of his Muslim subjects...

1059
01:36:21,276 --> 01:36:23,360
...who are a minority in this realm.

1060
01:36:23,611 --> 01:36:26,989
And experience suggests
that his troops...

1061
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:30,826
...and his administration
are essential...

1062
01:36:31,077 --> 01:36:33,620
...in order to secure the peace.

1063
01:36:34,456 --> 01:36:37,791
All nations contain
religious minorities.

1064
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:41,128
Like other countries,
ours will have its problems.

1065
01:36:41,421 --> 01:36:43,088
But they will be ours...

1066
01:36:43,465 --> 01:36:44,631
...not yours.

1067
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,885
How do you propose
to make them yours?

1068
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:51,472
You don't think we're just
going to walk out of lndia.

1069
01:36:52,182 --> 01:36:54,016
Yes.

1070
01:36:54,225 --> 01:36:57,019
In the end, you will walk out...

1071
01:36:57,187 --> 01:37:00,856
...because 1 00,000 Englishmen
simply cannot control...

1072
01:37:01,065 --> 01:37:03,775
...350 million lndians
if those Indians refuse...

1073
01:37:04,027 --> 01:37:05,652
...to cooperate.

1074
01:37:05,862 --> 01:37:08,322
And that is what
we intend to achieve.

1075
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:12,868
Peaceful, nonviolent
noncooperation...

1076
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:16,788
...till you yourself
see the wisdom of leaving...

1077
01:37:17,540 --> 01:37:18,957
...Your Excellency.

1078
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:24,796
I said to him, "You don't
expect us just to walk out."

1079
01:37:25,006 --> 01:37:26,882
And he said, "Yes."

1080
01:37:27,258 --> 01:37:29,843
What an extraordinary little man,
isn't he?

1081
01:37:30,053 --> 01:37:32,304
"Nonviolence, noncooperation."

1082
01:37:32,472 --> 01:37:35,599
For a moment, I was afraid they were
actually gonna do something.

1083
01:37:35,767 --> 01:37:40,312
Yes, but l think it would be wise
to be very cautious for a time.

1084
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:43,357
The Antiterrorist Act
will remain on the statutes...

1085
01:37:43,566 --> 01:37:47,027
...but on no account
is Gandhi to be arrested.

1086
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:49,738
Whatever mischief he causes...

1087
01:37:49,948 --> 01:37:52,991
...l have no intention
of making a martyr of him.

1088
01:37:57,038 --> 01:37:59,873
But now something worse
is happening.

1089
01:38:00,083 --> 01:38:02,376
When Gandhiji and I
were growing up...

1090
01:38:03,044 --> 01:38:05,879
...women wove their own cloth.

1091
01:38:06,965 --> 01:38:09,841
But now there are millions
who have no work...

1092
01:38:10,593 --> 01:38:15,514
...because those who can
buy all they need from England.

1093
01:38:16,766 --> 01:38:18,976
I say with Gandhiji:

1094
01:38:19,644 --> 01:38:22,729
There is no beauty
in the finest cloth...

1095
01:38:22,981 --> 01:38:26,984
...if it makes hunger and unhappiness.

1096
01:38:58,224 --> 01:39:00,309
My message to you...

1097
01:39:01,185 --> 01:39:04,730
...is the message l have given
to your brothers everywhere.

1098
01:39:05,607 --> 01:39:07,941
To gain independence...

1099
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:10,319
...we must prove worthy of it.

1100
01:39:11,696 --> 01:39:16,617
There must be
Hindu-Muslim unity always.

1101
01:39:21,998 --> 01:39:23,040
Second:

1102
01:39:24,167 --> 01:39:27,711
No Indian must be treated
as the English treat us.

1103
01:39:27,962 --> 01:39:30,339
We must remove untouchability...

1104
01:39:30,548 --> 01:39:33,425
...from our hearts and from our lives.

1105
01:39:39,015 --> 01:39:40,349
Third:

1106
01:39:41,059 --> 01:39:43,727
We must defy the British.

1107
01:40:00,703 --> 01:40:04,956
Not with violence
that will inflame their will...

1108
01:40:06,209 --> 01:40:09,628
...but with a firmness that will
open their eyes.

1109
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:12,881
English factories make the cloth...

1110
01:40:13,383 --> 01:40:15,592
...that makes our poverty.

1111
01:40:16,344 --> 01:40:19,346
All those who wish to
make the English see...

1112
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:24,434
...bring me the cloth from Manchester
and Leeds that you wear today...

1113
01:40:24,894 --> 01:40:27,688
...and we will light a fire
that will be seen in Delhi...

1114
01:40:28,981 --> 01:40:30,440
...and in London.

1115
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:32,150
And if...

1116
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,319
...like me...

1117
01:40:35,071 --> 01:40:38,240
...you are left with only
one piece of homespun...

1118
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:43,370
...wear it with dignity.

1119
01:41:26,581 --> 01:41:28,582
Thank you very much.

1120
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:31,293
No, thank you, I can manage.

1121
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:35,756
Don't destroy my good intentions.
I already feel guilty...

1122
01:41:35,923 --> 01:41:39,217
-...about traveling second class.
-You've earned a few indulgences.

1123
01:41:39,385 --> 01:41:42,012
Perhaps, but Maulana's made
of sterner stuff.

1124
01:41:42,263 --> 01:41:43,889
Our trains met in Bombay.

1125
01:41:44,098 --> 01:41:47,225
And there he is, back in
that lot, the model disciple.

1126
01:41:47,477 --> 01:41:49,352
There's another passenger.

1127
01:41:49,645 --> 01:41:53,398
A Miss Slade from London. She's
been writing to Gandhiji for years.

1128
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:56,026
She's the daughter
of an English admiral.

1129
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:59,738
What do you think the daughter
of an English admiral...

1130
01:41:59,947 --> 01:42:01,615
...proposes to do in our ashram?

1131
01:42:01,824 --> 01:42:04,868
-Sink us?
-From the looks of the luggage, yes.

1132
01:42:05,161 --> 01:42:08,705
She wants to make her home with us.
And Gandhiji has agreed.

1133
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:10,540
Miss Slade!

1134
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:12,834
You'd be Mr. Kallenbach.

1135
01:42:13,669 --> 01:42:16,296
And you would be Miss Slade?

1136
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:19,132
I prefer the name
Gandhiji has given me:

1137
01:42:19,342 --> 01:42:20,634
Mirabehn.

1138
01:42:26,599 --> 01:42:30,560
Don't pull it so fast.
You'll break it again.

1139
01:42:37,318 --> 01:42:40,570
Leave it. Leave it.

1140
01:42:40,863 --> 01:42:42,906
God gave you 1 0 thumbs.

1141
01:42:43,157 --> 01:42:44,324
Eleven.

1142
01:42:48,663 --> 01:42:50,372
Sardar!

1143
01:42:56,462 --> 01:42:58,171
Mirabehn!

1144
01:43:04,762 --> 01:43:06,429
Come, come.

1145
01:43:08,140 --> 01:43:10,392
You will be my daughter.

1146
01:43:12,353 --> 01:43:13,854
But then...

1147
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:16,189
...some rioting broke out...

1148
01:43:16,399 --> 01:43:19,234
...between Hindus and Muslims.

1149
01:43:20,152 --> 01:43:22,696
Violent, terrible.

1150
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:25,949
Whether it was provoked...

1151
01:43:26,450 --> 01:43:28,326
...l don't know.

1152
01:43:29,161 --> 01:43:33,081
But it gave them an excuse to impose
martial law throughout Bengal.

1153
01:43:34,834 --> 01:43:37,377
Some of the things
the military have done....

1154
01:43:37,753 --> 01:43:39,796
Is the campaign weakening?

1155
01:43:40,089 --> 01:43:43,174
The marches and protests are bigger,
if anything.

1156
01:43:43,384 --> 01:43:45,302
But with the censorship here...

1157
01:43:46,053 --> 01:43:49,806
...they know more in England
than we do.

1158
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:53,351
It saps the courage to think you
may be suffering alone.

1159
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:55,854
They are not alone.

1160
01:43:56,355 --> 01:44:00,567
And martial law only shows
how desperate the British are.

1161
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:07,115
Is that homespun?

1162
01:44:08,618 --> 01:44:12,162
I sent for it from here.
I dyed it myself.

1163
01:44:16,334 --> 01:44:19,002
What do the workers in England
make of what we're doing?

1164
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:20,754
It must have produced hardship.

1165
01:44:20,963 --> 01:44:22,339
It has...

1166
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:25,300
...but you'd be surprised.
They do understand.

1167
01:44:25,509 --> 01:44:26,718
Good.

1168
01:44:29,847 --> 01:44:32,182
Ba will have to teach you
to spin too.

1169
01:44:32,433 --> 01:44:34,434
-l'd rather march.
-First, spin!

1170
01:44:35,978 --> 01:44:38,396
Let the others march for a time.

1171
01:44:39,315 --> 01:44:41,983
I'll teach you all our foolishness.

1172
01:44:42,234 --> 01:44:43,985
And you must teach me yours.

1173
01:44:52,453 --> 01:44:56,289
We burn British cloth!
We burn British cloth!

1174
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:07,092
Long live Gandhiji!
Long live Gandhiji!

1175
01:45:20,773 --> 01:45:24,776
British rule must go!
British rule must go!

1176
01:45:31,534 --> 01:45:33,660
I'll stuff it down your damn throat!

1177
01:45:35,413 --> 01:45:36,997
Help us!

1178
01:45:37,373 --> 01:45:39,541
Leave us alone!
We're not harming you.

1179
01:45:40,126 --> 01:45:41,918
Go on your way. On your way!

1180
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:44,587
Come back!

1181
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,383
Help us! Help us!

1182
01:45:51,053 --> 01:45:52,929
Help! Help!

1183
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:26,689
That's one bit of news
they haven't censored.

1184
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:32,570
Now it's all over the world.

1185
01:47:32,822 --> 01:47:35,740
India's "nonviolence."

1186
01:47:37,827 --> 01:47:39,410
What can we do?

1187
01:47:39,995 --> 01:47:41,704
We must end the campaign.

1188
01:47:45,042 --> 01:47:48,628
After what they did at the massacre?
It's only an eye for an eye.

1189
01:47:48,879 --> 01:47:53,466
An eye for an eye only ends up
making the whole world blind.

1190
01:47:53,968 --> 01:47:56,386
Do you know the sacrifices
people have made?

1191
01:47:56,595 --> 01:47:58,972
We'd never get the same
commitment again, ever.

1192
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:02,142
The whole of India is on the move!

1193
01:48:02,351 --> 01:48:04,602
Yes, but in what direction?

1194
01:48:04,895 --> 01:48:08,773
If we obtain our freedom by murder
and bloodshed, l want no part of it.

1195
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:15,071
Bapu, you are the father of the nation.

1196
01:48:15,322 --> 01:48:18,449
Today, l see no ground in that
for anything but shame.

1197
01:48:21,620 --> 01:48:24,164
This was one incident.

1198
01:48:24,415 --> 01:48:27,292
Tell that to the families of
the policemen who died.

1199
01:48:31,422 --> 01:48:36,467
Bapu, the whole nation is marching.

1200
01:48:36,844 --> 01:48:39,971
They wouldn't stop,
even if we asked them to.

1201
01:48:42,474 --> 01:48:44,267
I will ask.

1202
01:48:44,894 --> 01:48:49,355
And l will fast as a penance
for my part in arousing such emotions.

1203
01:48:49,565 --> 01:48:52,192
And l will not stop until they stop.

1204
01:48:54,028 --> 01:48:55,111
But....

1205
01:48:55,529 --> 01:48:58,656
God! You can be sure
the British won't censor that.

1206
01:48:58,866 --> 01:49:00,950
They'll put it on every street corner.

1207
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:06,122
Gandhiji, people are aroused.

1208
01:49:06,332 --> 01:49:08,082
They won't stop!

1209
01:49:09,793 --> 01:49:12,754
If l die, perhaps they will stop.

1210
01:49:52,127 --> 01:49:55,004
I must get ready for morning prayers.

1211
01:49:55,256 --> 01:49:57,257
Mirabehn is here.

1212
01:50:43,846 --> 01:50:46,055
I've brought your drinking water.

1213
01:50:58,861 --> 01:51:02,071
There's a little lemon juice in it.
That's all.

1214
01:51:14,877 --> 01:51:17,962
Herman has gone
to meet Pandit Nehru.

1215
01:51:18,547 --> 01:51:20,340
There was a telegram.

1216
01:51:20,674 --> 01:51:23,634
Almost everywhere, it has stopped.

1217
01:51:24,053 --> 01:51:25,887
When it is everywhere...

1218
01:51:27,348 --> 01:51:30,016
...then my prayers will be answered.

1219
01:51:33,979 --> 01:51:36,105
Do you find me stubborn?

1220
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:38,191
I don't know.

1221
01:51:39,193 --> 01:51:41,319
I know that you are right.

1222
01:51:41,779 --> 01:51:44,238
I don't know that this is right.

1223
01:51:46,825 --> 01:51:48,618
May I turn you?

1224
01:52:02,216 --> 01:52:04,342
When I despair...

1225
01:52:04,843 --> 01:52:08,346
...l remember that
all through history...

1226
01:52:09,223 --> 01:52:13,434
...the way of truth and love
has always won.

1227
01:52:15,396 --> 01:52:18,314
There have been tyrants
and murderers...

1228
01:52:18,524 --> 01:52:22,652
...and, for a time,
they can seem invincible.

1229
01:52:22,861 --> 01:52:26,030
But in the end, they always fall.

1230
01:52:27,699 --> 01:52:29,117
Think of it.

1231
01:52:30,702 --> 01:52:32,412
Always.

1232
01:52:34,331 --> 01:52:37,792
Whenever you are in doubt
that that is God's way...

1233
01:52:38,001 --> 01:52:40,962
...the way the world is meant to be...

1234
01:52:41,171 --> 01:52:42,713
...think of that...

1235
01:52:44,133 --> 01:52:47,427
...and then try to do it his way.

1236
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:55,143
And now, could l have
another feast of lemon juice?

1237
01:52:59,064 --> 01:53:00,565
Panditji!

1238
01:53:13,454 --> 01:53:14,996
Jinnah...

1239
01:53:15,247 --> 01:53:16,414
...Patel...

1240
01:53:16,999 --> 01:53:21,127
...all of congress has called
for the end of noncooperation.

1241
01:53:21,378 --> 01:53:25,047
There's not been one demonstration.

1242
01:53:26,049 --> 01:53:30,803
All over lndia, people are praying
that you will end the fast.

1243
01:53:31,263 --> 01:53:32,847
They're walking in the streets...

1244
01:53:33,056 --> 01:53:35,808
...offering garlands to the police...

1245
01:53:37,895 --> 01:53:39,312
...and British soldiers.

1246
01:53:42,232 --> 01:53:44,567
Perhaps I have overdone it.

1247
01:54:05,797 --> 01:54:08,424
-Good morning, Bapu.
-Good morning.

1248
01:54:08,717 --> 01:54:11,969
Don't let him go.
If he bumps me, I'm done for.

1249
01:54:12,179 --> 01:54:14,096
Don't worry, l won't let him go.

1250
01:54:42,918 --> 01:54:44,544
I'm sorry, Mr. Gandhi, sir...

1251
01:54:44,753 --> 01:54:46,295
...but you're under arrest.

1252
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:48,297
On what charge?

1253
01:54:48,549 --> 01:54:49,924
Sedition.

1254
01:54:50,425 --> 01:54:52,343
You can't be serious.

1255
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:54,554
This man has just stopped
a revolution.

1256
01:54:54,721 --> 01:54:55,888
That's as may be.

1257
01:54:56,098 --> 01:54:58,015
I only know what
I am charged to perform.

1258
01:54:58,267 --> 01:54:59,684
I don't believe it!

1259
01:54:59,935 --> 01:55:02,311
Even the British can't be that stupid.

1260
01:55:03,230 --> 01:55:05,022
Help me, please.

1261
01:55:05,190 --> 01:55:08,067
Mira, you must look after Ba.

1262
01:55:12,656 --> 01:55:16,784
If there is one protest, one riot,
a disgrace of any kind...

1263
01:55:16,994 --> 01:55:18,411
...l will fast again.

1264
01:55:18,745 --> 01:55:19,954
Herman.

1265
01:55:20,414 --> 01:55:22,540
I have been on many trips.

1266
01:55:23,125 --> 01:55:24,750
Monda.

1267
01:55:25,043 --> 01:55:27,003
This is just another trip.

1268
01:55:27,879 --> 01:55:29,755
I am at your command.

1269
01:55:35,345 --> 01:55:38,556
I know we are not ready
for my kind of independence.

1270
01:55:38,765 --> 01:55:41,934
If l'm sent to jail,
perhaps that is the best protest...

1271
01:55:42,144 --> 01:55:44,395
...our country can make at this time.

1272
01:55:45,397 --> 01:55:50,234
And if it helps lndia, l've never
refused His Majesty's hospitality.

1273
01:55:58,410 --> 01:56:00,578
Call the prisoner to the bar.

1274
01:56:46,583 --> 01:56:49,502
"Noncooperation has one aim:

1275
01:56:49,711 --> 01:56:51,921
The overthrow of the government.

1276
01:56:52,214 --> 01:56:54,632
Sedition must become our creed.

1277
01:56:55,217 --> 01:56:57,134
We must give no quarter...

1278
01:56:57,386 --> 01:57:00,262
...nor can we expect any."

1279
01:57:00,472 --> 01:57:02,723
-Do you deny writing it?
-Not at all.

1280
01:57:03,684 --> 01:57:05,601
And l will save the court's time...

1281
01:57:05,811 --> 01:57:08,354
...my lord, by stating
under oath that, to this day...

1282
01:57:08,563 --> 01:57:10,940
...l believe noncooperation
with evil is a duty...

1283
01:57:11,108 --> 01:57:13,401
...and that British rule
of lndia is evil.

1284
01:57:14,444 --> 01:57:17,029
The prosecution rests, my lord.

1285
01:57:21,159 --> 01:57:24,954
I presume you are conducting
your own defense, Mr. Gandhi.

1286
01:57:25,122 --> 01:57:27,790
I have no defense, my lord.
I am guilty as charged.

1287
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:30,710
And if you truly believe
in your system of law...

1288
01:57:30,961 --> 01:57:35,673
...you must inflict on me
the severest penalty possible.

1289
01:57:46,852 --> 01:57:50,563
It is impossible for me to ignore
that you're in a different category...

1290
01:57:50,772 --> 01:57:53,774
...from any person
I have ever tried...

1291
01:57:54,609 --> 01:57:56,694
...or am likely to try.

1292
01:57:57,195 --> 01:57:59,697
Nevertheless, it is my duty
to sentence you...

1293
01:57:59,906 --> 01:58:03,701
...to six years' imprisonment.

1294
01:58:13,962 --> 01:58:17,965
If, however, His Majesty's government
should, at some later date...

1295
01:58:18,717 --> 01:58:21,761
...see fit to reduce the term...

1296
01:58:24,097 --> 01:58:27,016
...no one will be
better pleased than I.

1297
01:58:54,753 --> 01:58:57,046
Yes, l'm sure that's exactly
what they hoped.

1298
01:58:57,339 --> 01:59:00,591
Put him in prison a few years.
With luck, he'd be forgotten.

1299
01:59:01,259 --> 01:59:03,344
Maybe they could even subdue him.

1300
01:59:04,221 --> 01:59:06,096
Well, he certainly wasn't forgotten.

1301
01:59:06,264 --> 01:59:09,225
As soon as he got out, he was back
tramping the countryside...

1302
01:59:09,392 --> 01:59:12,686
...preaching nonviolence
and demanding a free lndia.

1303
01:59:14,105 --> 01:59:17,066
Everyone knows
another showdown's coming.

1304
01:59:18,819 --> 01:59:21,403
How does an American journalist
in Central America...

1305
01:59:21,613 --> 01:59:24,365
...learn that Gandhi was born
in Porbandar anyway?

1306
01:59:24,741 --> 01:59:26,575
I've been aware of him
for a long time.

1307
01:59:26,785 --> 01:59:28,786
He certainly makes good copy.

1308
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:33,749
The other day, Winston Churchill
called him a half-naked Indian fakir.

1309
01:59:35,460 --> 01:59:36,669
I met him once.

1310
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:38,587
-What, you mean Gandhi?
-Yeah.

1311
01:59:38,839 --> 01:59:41,131
South Africa, a long time ago.

1312
01:59:41,633 --> 01:59:43,551
I wonder if he'll recognize me.

1313
01:59:43,802 --> 01:59:44,844
What was he like?

1314
01:59:45,095 --> 01:59:47,304
He had a full head of hair then.

1315
01:59:47,472 --> 01:59:50,683
We were like college students,
trying to figure everything out.

1316
01:59:50,851 --> 01:59:53,686
Well, he must have found
some of the answers.

1317
02:00:00,193 --> 02:00:04,029
In every worthy wish of yours,
I shall be your helpmate.

1318
02:00:04,281 --> 02:00:06,282
Helpmate.

1319
02:00:07,409 --> 02:00:12,079
Take the fourth step,
that we may be ever full ofjoy.

1320
02:00:13,373 --> 02:00:15,833
I will ever live devoted to you...

1321
02:00:16,084 --> 02:00:20,671
...speaking words of love
and praying for your happiness.

1322
02:00:22,007 --> 02:00:24,341
Take the fifth step...

1323
02:00:24,593 --> 02:00:26,343
...the walking around a fire...

1324
02:00:28,972 --> 02:00:32,057
...that we may serve the people.

1325
02:00:32,309 --> 02:00:34,977
I will follow close behind you...

1326
02:00:35,186 --> 02:00:37,771
...and help to serve the people.

1327
02:00:39,482 --> 02:00:41,358
Take the sixth step...

1328
02:00:42,569 --> 02:00:46,113
...that we may follow
our vows in life.

1329
02:00:46,489 --> 02:00:50,910
I will follow you
in all our vows and duties.

1330
02:00:52,037 --> 02:00:54,163
Take the seventh step...

1331
02:00:57,042 --> 02:01:00,127
...that we may ever
live as friends.

1332
02:01:02,255 --> 02:01:04,882
You are my best friend...

1333
02:01:06,009 --> 02:01:08,010
...my highest guru...

1334
02:01:08,929 --> 02:01:11,347
...and my sovereign lord.

1335
02:01:15,477 --> 02:01:18,479
And then I put a sweetened
wheat cake in her mouth.

1336
02:01:18,730 --> 02:01:21,273
And l put a sweetened
wheat cake in his mouth.

1337
02:01:21,524 --> 02:01:24,068
And with that, we were pronounced...

1338
02:01:24,361 --> 02:01:25,945
...man and wife.

1339
02:01:28,198 --> 02:01:30,741
We were both 1 3.

1340
02:01:43,088 --> 02:01:44,713
It's beautiful.

1341
02:01:46,257 --> 02:01:48,217
Even as a boy...

1342
02:01:48,426 --> 02:01:49,927
...l thought so.

1343
02:01:51,972 --> 02:01:53,472
Thank you.

1344
02:01:54,557 --> 02:01:57,851
Trying to keep up with you
is like chasing a jackrabbit.

1345
02:01:59,729 --> 02:02:03,440
You've come because you think
something is going to happen.

1346
02:02:05,026 --> 02:02:07,861
-ls it?
-Perhaps.

1347
02:02:08,780 --> 02:02:10,739
I've come here to think about it.

1348
02:02:14,536 --> 02:02:16,620
Do you remember much
of South Africa?

1349
02:02:16,830 --> 02:02:19,331
Oh, yes. A great deal.

1350
02:02:21,710 --> 02:02:23,585
I've traveled so far...

1351
02:02:24,212 --> 02:02:26,422
...and thought so much.

1352
02:02:30,635 --> 02:02:34,763
As you can see,
my city is a sea city.

1353
02:02:36,099 --> 02:02:38,434
Always full of Hindus...

1354
02:02:38,643 --> 02:02:40,185
...Muslims...

1355
02:02:40,395 --> 02:02:42,604
...Sikhs, Jews, Persians.

1356
02:02:45,066 --> 02:02:48,110
My family's sect was the Pranami.

1357
02:02:48,528 --> 02:02:49,820
Hindu, of course.

1358
02:02:50,030 --> 02:02:53,282
But in our temple,
the priest used to read...

1359
02:02:53,491 --> 02:02:55,743
...from the Muslim Koran...

1360
02:02:55,952 --> 02:02:58,787
...and the Hindu Gita,
moving from one to the other...

1361
02:02:58,997 --> 02:03:01,540
...as if it mattered not
which book was read...

1362
02:03:01,750 --> 02:03:03,625
...as long as God was worshiped.

1363
02:03:07,338 --> 02:03:08,589
When I was a boy...

1364
02:03:09,174 --> 02:03:11,300
...l used to sing a song
in the temple.

1365
02:03:14,804 --> 02:03:19,099
A true disciple
Knows another's woes

1366
02:03:19,309 --> 02:03:21,518
As his own

1367
02:03:22,020 --> 02:03:23,228
He bows to all...

1368
02:03:23,438 --> 02:03:25,647
...and despises none.

1369
02:03:26,941 --> 02:03:28,108
Like all other boys...

1370
02:03:28,318 --> 02:03:29,860
...l sang the words...

1371
02:03:30,528 --> 02:03:34,615
...not thinking what they meant
or how they might influence me.

1372
02:03:38,203 --> 02:03:40,245
I've traveled so far.

1373
02:03:41,539 --> 02:03:43,999
And all l've done is come back...

1374
02:03:44,793 --> 02:03:46,085
...home.

1375
02:03:56,304 --> 02:03:58,138
Wait a minute.

1376
02:03:58,681 --> 02:04:01,934
-You know what you're gonna do?
-lt would have been uncivil of me...

1377
02:04:02,143 --> 02:04:04,895
...to let you make
such a long trip for nothing.

1378
02:04:07,107 --> 02:04:09,024
-Where are you going?
-Come.

1379
02:04:10,860 --> 02:04:13,112
-Where are we going?
-Back to the ashram.

1380
02:04:13,363 --> 02:04:15,322
Then to prove to the new viceroy...

1381
02:04:15,573 --> 02:04:18,492
...that the king's writ
no longer runs in lndia.

1382
02:04:18,827 --> 02:04:19,868
Salt?

1383
02:04:20,078 --> 02:04:24,039
Yes, sir. He's going to march
to the sea and make salt.

1384
02:04:26,126 --> 02:04:29,503
There's a royal monopoly
on the manufacture of salt.

1385
02:04:29,712 --> 02:04:34,258
It's illegal to make it or sell it
without a government license.

1386
02:04:34,717 --> 02:04:36,927
All right, he's breaking the law.

1387
02:04:37,178 --> 02:04:40,472
What will that deprive us of?
Two rupees of salt tax?

1388
02:04:40,682 --> 02:04:45,394
It's not a serious attack on the revenue.
Its primary importance is symbolic.

1389
02:04:45,603 --> 02:04:49,231
-Don't patronize me, Charles.
-No, sir, l....

1390
02:04:52,068 --> 02:04:55,362
In this climate, nothing lives
without water or salt.

1391
02:04:55,613 --> 02:04:59,700
Our absolute control of it is
a control on the pulse of India.

1392
02:05:00,535 --> 02:05:04,288
And that's the basis of
this declaration of independence?

1393
02:05:04,497 --> 02:05:05,747
The day he sets off...

1394
02:05:05,999 --> 02:05:10,002
...everyone is supposed to
raise the flag of "Free lndia."

1395
02:05:10,712 --> 02:05:15,424
And then he walks some 240 miles
to the sea and makes salt.

1396
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:21,722
I say ignore it.

1397
02:05:21,973 --> 02:05:24,433
Let them raise their damned flags.

1398
02:05:24,684 --> 02:05:25,726
Let him make his salt.

1399
02:05:26,853 --> 02:05:29,938
It's only symbolic
if we choose to make it so.

1400
02:05:32,317 --> 02:05:33,984
He'll arrive at the sea...

1401
02:05:34,194 --> 02:05:37,321
...on the anniversary
of the Massacre of Amritsar.

1402
02:05:46,456 --> 02:05:48,957
General Edgar is right. lgnore it.

1403
02:05:49,375 --> 02:05:52,211
Mr. Gandhi will find
it takes a great deal more...

1404
02:05:52,462 --> 02:05:56,256
...than a pinch of salt
to bring down the British Empire.

1405
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:53,397
You've done me a great service.

1406
02:06:53,648 --> 02:06:54,856
Not at all, sir.

1407
02:06:55,108 --> 02:06:59,194
It would be uncivil for us to let you
make such a long trip for nothing.

1408
02:07:14,085 --> 02:07:15,294
We'll go.

1409
02:07:15,545 --> 02:07:19,131
Long live Gandhiji!
Long live Gandhiji!

1410
02:07:41,738 --> 02:07:43,613
Is it over if they arrest you now?

1411
02:07:43,781 --> 02:07:44,948
Not if they arrest me...

1412
02:07:45,199 --> 02:07:47,617
...or 1 000 or 1 0,000.

1413
02:07:47,869 --> 02:07:51,788
It's not only generals
who know how to plan campaigns.

1414
02:07:52,248 --> 02:07:55,250
What if they don't arrest you?
What if they don't react at all?

1415
02:07:55,418 --> 02:07:56,752
Something for your notebook:

1416
02:07:57,045 --> 02:08:00,422
The function of a civil resister
is to provoke response.

1417
02:08:00,715 --> 02:08:02,424
And we will continue to provoke...

1418
02:08:02,633 --> 02:08:05,969
...until they respond
or they change the law.

1419
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:09,348
They are not in control.
We are.

1420
02:08:09,974 --> 02:08:13,018
That is the strength
of civil resistance.

1421
02:08:17,690 --> 02:08:19,066
Vince!

1422
02:08:19,984 --> 02:08:23,612
-What did he say?
-He said he's in control.

1423
02:08:45,593 --> 02:08:47,636
Do you intend to walk all the way?

1424
02:08:47,887 --> 02:08:50,180
It's the only way
I can get the story.

1425
02:08:50,431 --> 02:08:52,849
Besides, my name is Walker.

1426
02:08:53,476 --> 02:08:55,769
"My name is Walker."

1427
02:09:49,949 --> 02:09:53,994
-My dear Mrs. Nehru!
-Bapu.

1428
02:10:47,173 --> 02:10:49,174
Man needs salt...

1429
02:10:49,383 --> 02:10:52,052
...as he needs air and water.

1430
02:10:52,595 --> 02:10:56,556
This salt comes
from the lndian Ocean.

1431
02:10:56,807 --> 02:11:00,685
Let every lndian claim it
as his right.

1432
02:11:02,230 --> 02:11:05,106
And so, once more,
the man of nonviolence...

1433
02:11:05,358 --> 02:11:08,610
...has challenged the might
of the British Empire.

1434
02:11:23,918 --> 02:11:26,878
They're making it everywhere, sir.
Mobs of them.

1435
02:11:27,129 --> 02:11:28,255
Publicly.

1436
02:11:28,506 --> 02:11:31,841
Congress leaders are selling it
on the streets of Delhi.

1437
02:11:32,385 --> 02:11:35,428
We're being made fools of, sir,
around the world.

1438
02:11:35,680 --> 02:11:37,847
Isn't there any instruction
from London?

1439
02:11:38,099 --> 02:11:41,476
We're required to stop it.
And stop it we will!

1440
02:11:41,727 --> 02:11:44,145
I don't care if we fill the jails.
Stop it!

1441
02:11:45,189 --> 02:11:48,024
Arrest anyone, any rank,
except Gandhi.

1442
02:11:49,110 --> 02:11:51,319
We'll cut the strength
from under him.

1443
02:11:52,488 --> 02:11:55,824
And then we'll deal with the Mahatma.

1444
02:12:13,342 --> 02:12:15,927
Jump to it! Clear this beach!

1445
02:12:51,422 --> 02:12:54,132
Don't hit back! No violence!

1446
02:13:04,268 --> 02:13:08,563
There must be 1 00,000 under arrest.
And it still goes on.

1447
02:13:08,814 --> 02:13:11,900
-Who's leading them?
-l don't know. Nehru, Patel...

1448
02:13:12,109 --> 02:13:16,321
...most congress officials are in jail.
And their wives and children.

1449
02:13:16,572 --> 02:13:19,366
We've even arrested Nehru's mother.

1450
02:13:21,702 --> 02:13:23,662
Has there been any violence?

1451
02:13:23,913 --> 02:13:26,748
In Peshawar,
the deputy police commissioner...

1452
02:13:26,957 --> 02:13:30,210
...lost his head and opened fire
with a machine gun.

1453
02:13:31,420 --> 02:13:34,422
But he's facing disciplinary court.

1454
02:13:34,632 --> 02:13:36,925
You can't expect things
like that not to happen.

1455
02:13:37,093 --> 02:13:41,680
The question was intended to discover
if there was any violence on their side.

1456
02:13:44,475 --> 02:13:45,642
No, sir.

1457
02:13:45,893 --> 02:13:47,936
I'm afraid not.

1458
02:13:48,229 --> 02:13:52,107
Perhaps if we arrested Gandhi,
it might....

1459
02:13:55,403 --> 02:13:57,987
He's addressed this letter
directly to you, has he?

1460
02:13:58,197 --> 02:13:59,364
Yes, sir, he has.

1461
02:13:59,615 --> 02:14:00,782
The usual thing:

1462
02:14:00,991 --> 02:14:03,201
"India's salt belongs to lndia."

1463
02:14:03,452 --> 02:14:04,536
Then he says flatly...

1464
02:14:04,704 --> 02:14:09,040
...that he will lead a raid tomorrow
on the Dharasana Salt Works.

1465
02:14:10,334 --> 02:14:12,168
Thank him for his letter...

1466
02:14:12,586 --> 02:14:14,421
...and put him in jail.

1467
02:14:16,340 --> 02:14:17,966
Yes, sir.

1468
02:14:19,719 --> 02:14:21,344
Yes, sir. It'll be my pleasure.

1469
02:14:21,595 --> 02:14:23,847
-And Fields?
-Sir?

1470
02:14:24,098 --> 02:14:26,516
Keep that salt works open.

1471
02:14:26,809 --> 02:14:28,601
Yes, sir.

1472
02:14:34,233 --> 02:14:35,275
I'm sorry, sir.

1473
02:14:35,443 --> 02:14:38,903
My orders are to allow regular staff
only through these gates.

1474
02:14:39,113 --> 02:14:40,488
Very well.

1475
02:14:42,533 --> 02:14:43,867
--in his name.

1476
02:14:44,076 --> 02:14:48,872
And for his sake,
we will not raise a hand.

1477
02:14:49,123 --> 02:14:52,292
Long live Mahatma Gandhi!

1478
02:14:54,545 --> 02:14:56,546
Long live Gandhiji!

1479
02:15:00,384 --> 02:15:02,177
We are ready!

1480
02:15:09,310 --> 02:15:11,394
I want firmness and discipline.

1481
02:15:31,624 --> 02:15:34,501
-All right, take up your positions.
-Yes, sir.

1482
02:15:41,425 --> 02:15:43,718
To your mark. Forward!

1483
02:15:54,396 --> 02:15:56,523
Last night at midnight...

1484
02:15:57,316 --> 02:15:58,942
...they took Gandhiji from us.

1485
02:16:00,444 --> 02:16:02,779
They expect us to lose heart...

1486
02:16:02,988 --> 02:16:04,697
...or to fight back.

1487
02:16:05,449 --> 02:16:07,617
We will do neither!

1488
02:16:39,024 --> 02:16:40,400
On your guard!

1489
02:16:57,251 --> 02:16:58,793
No, sir. The gate is closed!

1490
02:18:18,040 --> 02:18:19,248
"They walked...

1491
02:18:19,792 --> 02:18:21,834
...both Hindu and Muslim alike...

1492
02:18:22,836 --> 02:18:24,796
...with heads held high...

1493
02:18:25,255 --> 02:18:27,131
...without any hope of escape...

1494
02:18:27,633 --> 02:18:29,425
...from injury or death.

1495
02:18:29,718 --> 02:18:33,012
It went on and on into the night."

1496
02:18:33,222 --> 02:18:34,263
Stop.

1497
02:18:34,431 --> 02:18:38,685
"Women carried the wounded
and broken bodies from the road...

1498
02:18:38,894 --> 02:18:41,396
...until they dropped
from exhaustion."

1499
02:18:41,605 --> 02:18:47,777
Stop. "But still, it went on and on."
Stop.

1500
02:18:48,028 --> 02:18:52,740
"Whatever moral ascendancy
the West held...

1501
02:18:52,950 --> 02:18:54,826
...was lost here today.

1502
02:18:55,619 --> 02:18:57,704
lndia is free...

1503
02:18:57,913 --> 02:19:02,792
...for she has taken all
that steel and cruelty can give...

1504
02:19:03,002 --> 02:19:08,589
...and she has neither
cringed nor retreated." Stop.

1505
02:20:17,576 --> 02:20:22,163
I am aware that l must have given
you much cause for irritation...

1506
02:20:22,372 --> 02:20:23,664
...Your Excellency.

1507
02:20:23,916 --> 02:20:26,918
I hope it will not stand
between us as men.

1508
02:20:31,465 --> 02:20:32,673
Mr. Gandhi...

1509
02:20:33,425 --> 02:20:36,761
...l am instructed to request
your attendance...

1510
02:20:36,970 --> 02:20:39,222
...at an all-government
conference in London...

1511
02:20:40,182 --> 02:20:45,061
...to discuss the possible
independence...

1512
02:20:45,270 --> 02:20:46,729
...of India.

1513
02:20:57,616 --> 02:20:59,992
Only recently released from prison...

1514
02:21:00,202 --> 02:21:04,163
...Mahatma Gandhi leaves Bombay
on the SS Rajputana...

1515
02:21:04,373 --> 02:21:07,208
...to attend the conference
on lndian independence...

1516
02:21:07,459 --> 02:21:11,712
...called by Prime Minister
Ramsay MacDonald.

1517
02:21:12,840 --> 02:21:15,883
Mr. Gandhi, the sole
Indian Congress Party delegate...

1518
02:21:16,093 --> 02:21:18,636
...is staying at Kingsley Hall
in London's East End...

1519
02:21:18,804 --> 02:21:20,471
...for the duration of the talks.

1520
02:21:20,931 --> 02:21:23,141
He's seen here
amongst local cockneys...

1521
02:21:23,350 --> 02:21:25,309
...who have taken him
to their hearts.

1522
02:21:25,561 --> 02:21:27,228
Besides attending the conference...

1523
02:21:27,437 --> 02:21:30,439
...he has found time to meet
political and religious leaders...

1524
02:21:30,607 --> 02:21:32,567
...like Mr. Lloyd George...

1525
02:21:32,818 --> 02:21:36,028
...the Archbishop of Canterbury,
George Bernard Shaw...

1526
02:21:36,238 --> 02:21:38,114
...and Charlie Chaplin.

1527
02:21:40,576 --> 02:21:42,952
He journeyed last week
from Kingsley Hall...

1528
02:21:43,162 --> 02:21:47,415
...to accept an invitation to tea
from King George and Queen Mary...

1529
02:21:47,624 --> 02:21:51,085
...at Buckingham Palace
before attending the conference.

1530
02:21:51,336 --> 02:21:54,881
And l would emphasize
that I think our first duty...

1531
02:21:55,090 --> 02:21:59,302
...is to recognize
that there is not one India...

1532
02:22:00,095 --> 02:22:01,512
...but several.

1533
02:22:02,264 --> 02:22:04,182
A Hindu lndia...

1534
02:22:04,433 --> 02:22:06,642
...a Muslim lndia...

1535
02:22:06,852 --> 02:22:09,437
...and an India of princely states.

1536
02:22:09,688 --> 02:22:12,523
And all these must be respected...

1537
02:22:12,733 --> 02:22:14,317
...and cared for.

1538
02:22:14,568 --> 02:22:15,943
Not just one.

1539
02:22:41,136 --> 02:22:42,970
Mr. Gandhi,
who has been attending...

1540
02:22:43,222 --> 02:22:46,307
...the London Round Table
Conference on lndian lndependence...

1541
02:22:46,516 --> 02:22:49,143
...journeyed north
to visit a cotton mill.

1542
02:22:49,686 --> 02:22:52,146
Although not dressed
for the Lancashire climate...

1543
02:22:52,356 --> 02:22:55,233
...Mr. Gandhi received
a warm welcome from mill workers...

1544
02:22:56,151 --> 02:22:57,693
...before heading back south...

1545
02:22:57,945 --> 02:23:00,529
...for a final meeting
with Mr. MacDonald.

1546
02:23:00,989 --> 02:23:05,826
The prime minister said the talks
were both constructive and frank.

1547
02:23:08,914 --> 02:23:11,290
So farewell, Mr. Gandhi.

1548
02:23:11,792 --> 02:23:14,126
And bon voyage!

1549
02:23:16,171 --> 02:23:18,631
So the truth is,
after all your travels...

1550
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:20,508
...after all your efforts...

1551
02:23:20,759 --> 02:23:24,637
...they've stopped the campaign
and sent you back empty-handed.

1552
02:23:25,055 --> 02:23:28,349
They're only clinging
to old dreams...

1553
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:31,435
...and trying to split us
in the old way.

1554
02:23:32,145 --> 02:23:33,938
But the will has gone.

1555
02:23:34,189 --> 02:23:37,233
Independence will fall
like a ripe apple.

1556
02:23:37,442 --> 02:23:40,027
The only question is, when and how.

1557
02:23:40,404 --> 02:23:42,196
Well, l say, when is now!

1558
02:23:44,449 --> 02:23:46,826
And we will determine how.

1559
02:23:47,077 --> 02:23:48,744
Precisely.

1560
02:23:49,162 --> 02:23:51,163
Bapu, she is limping again.

1561
02:23:51,665 --> 02:23:53,082
It's only a sprain.

1562
02:23:53,542 --> 02:23:56,919
Take her to the river.
We'll make a mud pack for her.

1563
02:23:58,213 --> 02:24:00,881
Go. l won't be a moment.

1564
02:24:04,469 --> 02:24:06,470
They are preparing for war.

1565
02:24:07,306 --> 02:24:08,597
I will not support it.

1566
02:24:08,807 --> 02:24:12,643
But l do not intend to take
advantage of their danger.

1567
02:24:12,894 --> 02:24:15,271
That's when you take advantage.

1568
02:24:15,605 --> 02:24:18,441
That is just another way
of hitting back.

1569
02:24:19,568 --> 02:24:21,861
We've come a long way together
with the British.

1570
02:24:22,029 --> 02:24:25,031
When they leave, we want to
see them off as friends.

1571
02:24:25,282 --> 02:24:30,244
Now, if you'll excuse me,
there is something I must attend to.

1572
02:24:36,501 --> 02:24:37,668
Mud packs.

1573
02:24:50,057 --> 02:24:51,974
Mr. Gandhi, sir.

1574
02:24:52,184 --> 02:24:55,853
I've been instructed to inquire as to
the subject of your speech tonight.

1575
02:24:56,063 --> 02:24:59,231
The value of goat's milk
in daily diet.

1576
02:25:01,276 --> 02:25:04,904
But you can be sure that
I will also speak against war.

1577
02:25:05,572 --> 02:25:07,156
Sorry, that can't be permitted.

1578
02:25:07,366 --> 02:25:08,407
Corporal!

1579
02:25:13,372 --> 02:25:14,705
It's all right, Mrs. Gandhi.

1580
02:25:14,873 --> 02:25:18,334
I have orders to return with you
and your companion to the ashram.

1581
02:25:19,086 --> 02:25:22,755
If you take my husband,
I intend to speak in his place.

1582
02:25:48,323 --> 02:25:50,116
Hold it a second, will you?

1583
02:25:51,701 --> 02:25:54,829
It was the Aga Khan's palace
before they turned it into a prison.

1584
02:25:54,996 --> 02:25:57,957
They're holding Gandhi
and congress politicians there.

1585
02:25:58,834 --> 02:26:02,336
Pandit Nehru and the others
are up at Ahmednagar Fort.

1586
02:26:04,131 --> 02:26:05,798
Not bad for a prison, eh?

1587
02:26:06,007 --> 02:26:08,509
I guess no place is good
if you're locked in.

1588
02:26:08,718 --> 02:26:10,761
Your timing's pretty lucky.

1589
02:26:11,012 --> 02:26:12,972
They had him cut off from the press.

1590
02:26:13,181 --> 02:26:16,976
But his personal secretary died,
so they let up on restrictions.

1591
02:26:22,107 --> 02:26:25,025
Yes, l have heard of LIFE magazine.

1592
02:26:25,277 --> 02:26:29,238
I've even heard of
Margaret Bourke-White.

1593
02:26:29,489 --> 02:26:33,409
But l don't know why either
should be interested in an old man...

1594
02:26:33,618 --> 02:26:36,078
...sitting alone in prison...

1595
02:26:36,329 --> 02:26:39,790
...while the rest of the world
is blowing itself to pieces.

1596
02:26:40,625 --> 02:26:44,336
Well, you're the only man I know
who makes his own clothes.

1597
02:26:46,590 --> 02:26:50,468
But for me, that's not
much of an accomplishment.

1598
02:26:56,391 --> 02:27:00,311
No, prison is rather agreeable to me.

1599
02:27:00,645 --> 02:27:04,273
And there is no doubt that
after the war...

1600
02:27:04,524 --> 02:27:06,692
...independence will come.

1601
02:27:07,027 --> 02:27:08,152
My only worry...

1602
02:27:08,361 --> 02:27:10,821
...is what shape it will take.

1603
02:27:11,072 --> 02:27:12,823
-Jinnah has--
-Stop!

1604
02:27:13,366 --> 02:27:16,702
I'm sorry, but--
Could you come forward, please?

1605
02:27:17,370 --> 02:27:19,580
-Come, come.
-Just up to the railing.

1606
02:27:19,831 --> 02:27:21,415
Thank you very much.

1607
02:27:22,584 --> 02:27:23,626
Thank you.

1608
02:27:23,835 --> 02:27:25,211
Now, sorry.

1609
02:27:25,420 --> 02:27:27,630
Go on. "What shape it will take...."

1610
02:27:27,839 --> 02:27:29,340
Jinnah has what?

1611
02:27:31,009 --> 02:27:34,637
Jinnah has cooperated
with the British.

1612
02:27:34,846 --> 02:27:39,058
It has given him power
and the freedom to speak.

1613
02:27:39,309 --> 02:27:41,852
And he's filled
the Muslims with fears...

1614
02:27:42,103 --> 02:27:44,271
...of what will happen to them...

1615
02:27:44,481 --> 02:27:47,441
...in a country that
is predominantly Hindu.

1616
02:27:48,151 --> 02:27:51,070
And that l find hard to bear...

1617
02:27:51,321 --> 02:27:52,988
...even in prison.

1618
02:27:53,198 --> 02:27:54,907
Mr. Gandhi?

1619
02:28:00,956 --> 02:28:05,543
It's hard for me to see this as a solution
to the 20th century's problems.

1620
02:28:06,294 --> 02:28:08,879
I have friends who keep telling me...

1621
02:28:09,089 --> 02:28:13,050
...how much it costs them
to keep me in poverty.

1622
02:28:14,803 --> 02:28:19,473
But l know happiness
does not come with things...

1623
02:28:19,724 --> 02:28:21,350
...even 20th-century things.

1624
02:28:21,601 --> 02:28:26,272
It can come from work
and pride in what you do.

1625
02:28:27,274 --> 02:28:30,192
India lives in her villages...

1626
02:28:30,443 --> 02:28:33,320
...and the terrible poverty there
can only be removed...

1627
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:36,907
...if their local skills
can be revived.

1628
02:28:37,325 --> 02:28:40,327
Poverty is the worst form
of violence.

1629
02:28:41,079 --> 02:28:43,497
And a constructive program
is the only...

1630
02:28:43,707 --> 02:28:47,001
...nonviolent solution
to lndia's agony.

1631
02:28:47,711 --> 02:28:50,379
It will not necessarily be
progress for lndia...

1632
02:28:50,589 --> 02:28:54,883
...if she simply imports
the unhappiness of the West.

1633
02:28:57,512 --> 02:29:01,056
Do you really believe you could
use nonviolence against Hitler?

1634
02:29:03,059 --> 02:29:06,312
Not without defeats and great pain.

1635
02:29:07,522 --> 02:29:10,190
But are there no defeats in this war?

1636
02:29:10,900 --> 02:29:12,818
No pain?

1637
02:29:13,612 --> 02:29:15,112
What you cannot do...

1638
02:29:15,363 --> 02:29:18,032
...is accept injustice
from Hitler or anyone.

1639
02:29:18,241 --> 02:29:21,368
You must make the injustice visible.

1640
02:29:21,578 --> 02:29:25,205
Be prepared to die
like a soldier to do so.

1641
02:29:28,627 --> 02:29:31,420
Is this what l'm meant to
end up with here?

1642
02:29:31,588 --> 02:29:32,713
No.

1643
02:29:32,922 --> 02:29:35,007
That's what you get
for distracting me.

1644
02:29:35,216 --> 02:29:37,301
What do you expect
when you talk like that?

1645
02:29:37,510 --> 02:29:42,097
I expect you to show
as much patience as l am now.

1646
02:29:43,016 --> 02:29:46,310
Turn slowly and pull it gently.

1647
02:29:51,775 --> 02:29:54,568
And that includes the life of women.

1648
02:29:55,236 --> 02:29:58,030
Bapu has always said...

1649
02:29:58,239 --> 02:30:01,075
...there were two kinds
of slavery in lndia:

1650
02:30:01,493 --> 02:30:05,245
One for women,
one for the untouchables.

1651
02:30:05,789 --> 02:30:09,083
And he has always
fought against both.

1652
02:30:11,795 --> 02:30:15,047
Does it rankle,
being separated in this way?

1653
02:30:18,677 --> 02:30:20,928
In Hindu philosophy...

1654
02:30:21,763 --> 02:30:23,222
...the way to God...

1655
02:30:23,431 --> 02:30:26,183
...is to free yourself
of possessions...

1656
02:30:27,143 --> 02:30:28,560
...and of passions.

1657
02:30:29,479 --> 02:30:33,857
Bapu has always struggled
to find the way to God.

1658
02:30:37,612 --> 02:30:41,782
Do you mean that
he gave up married life?

1659
02:30:44,411 --> 02:30:47,121
Four times he tried...

1660
02:30:47,872 --> 02:30:49,331
...and failed.

1661
02:30:51,084 --> 02:30:53,085
But then he took a solemn vow.

1662
02:30:55,922 --> 02:30:57,131
And he's never broken it?

1663
02:31:00,677 --> 02:31:01,844
Not yet.

1664
02:31:19,779 --> 02:31:23,115
-l've got permission to move her.
-l'm very sorry, sir.

1665
02:31:23,324 --> 02:31:26,160
She's had a massive thrombosis.
It's a serious heart attack.

1666
02:31:26,411 --> 02:31:27,995
She'll never survive the trip.

1667
02:31:28,204 --> 02:31:31,165
It's better if we just
keep her here and hope.

1668
02:32:18,713 --> 02:32:21,548
It's time for my walk.

1669
02:32:23,968 --> 02:32:25,552
I won't be long.

1670
02:34:43,524 --> 02:34:44,650
Guard...

1671
02:34:44,817 --> 02:34:46,860
...present arms!

1672
02:35:02,710 --> 02:35:06,713
We have come to crown victory
with friendship.

1673
02:35:08,841 --> 02:35:11,760
To assist at the birth of
an independent lndia...

1674
02:35:11,928 --> 02:35:13,887
...and to welcome her
as an equal member...

1675
02:35:14,055 --> 02:35:16,431
...in the British Commonwealth
of Nations.

1676
02:35:17,725 --> 02:35:20,727
I am here to see that I am
the last British viceroy...

1677
02:35:20,937 --> 02:35:24,773
...ever to have the honor
of such a reception.

1678
02:35:37,245 --> 02:35:39,997
I am not concerned about
the independence of India.

1679
02:35:40,248 --> 02:35:42,457
I'm concerned about
the slavery of Muslims.

1680
02:35:42,709 --> 02:35:44,793
Please, Mr. Jinnah.

1681
02:35:45,044 --> 02:35:47,629
I won't watch the mastery
of the British...

1682
02:35:47,839 --> 02:35:50,132
...replaced by
the mastery of the Hindus.

1683
02:35:56,639 --> 02:36:00,684
Muslim and Hindu are the right
and left eye of lndia.

1684
02:36:01,269 --> 02:36:04,062
No one will be master, no one slave.

1685
02:36:04,313 --> 02:36:06,606
The world is not made of
Mahatma Gandhis.

1686
02:36:06,858 --> 02:36:08,525
I'm talking about the real world.

1687
02:36:08,776 --> 02:36:10,360
-How the--
-The real India has...

1688
02:36:10,611 --> 02:36:14,489
...Muslims and Hindus
in every village and every city.

1689
02:36:15,908 --> 02:36:17,242
How will you separate them?

1690
02:36:17,785 --> 02:36:20,829
Where there is a Muslim majority...

1691
02:36:21,164 --> 02:36:22,956
...that will be Pakistan.

1692
02:36:23,207 --> 02:36:25,792
The rest is your India.

1693
02:36:26,002 --> 02:36:27,085
My dear Jinnah...

1694
02:36:27,628 --> 02:36:31,548
...the Muslims are in a majority
on two different sides of the country.

1695
02:36:31,799 --> 02:36:35,844
Let us worry about Pakistan.
You worry about India.

1696
02:36:36,095 --> 02:36:37,179
Gentlemen...

1697
02:36:37,430 --> 02:36:39,556
...l think perhaps
we should recommence.

1698
02:36:53,821 --> 02:36:57,616
Death to Jinnah!
Death to Jinnah!

1699
02:37:25,103 --> 02:37:27,104
Thank God, they've stopped.

1700
02:37:30,566 --> 02:37:32,359
Manu. Abha.

1701
02:37:40,159 --> 02:37:41,701
I'm your granduncle...

1702
02:37:41,953 --> 02:37:45,288
...but l can still walk
either of you into the ground.

1703
02:37:45,498 --> 02:37:47,999
I don't need to be pampered
in this way.

1704
02:37:48,209 --> 02:37:50,460
Finish your quota of spinning.

1705
02:38:31,836 --> 02:38:34,838
Bapu. Bapu.

1706
02:38:35,006 --> 02:38:36,756
Bapu, please don't do it.

1707
02:38:36,966 --> 02:38:39,676
What do you want me not to do?

1708
02:38:39,969 --> 02:38:42,012
Not to meet with Mr. Jinnah?

1709
02:38:43,806 --> 02:38:45,807
I am a Muslim...

1710
02:38:46,142 --> 02:38:47,225
...and a Hindu...

1711
02:38:47,685 --> 02:38:49,769
...and a Christian and a Jew.

1712
02:38:50,605 --> 02:38:53,064
And so are all of you.

1713
02:38:55,234 --> 02:38:58,028
When you wave those flags
and shout...

1714
02:38:58,362 --> 02:39:01,531
...you send fear into the hearts
of your brothers.

1715
02:39:01,741 --> 02:39:03,742
That is not the India l want.

1716
02:39:03,993 --> 02:39:05,076
Stop it!

1717
02:39:05,328 --> 02:39:08,288
For God's sake, stop it.

1718
02:39:25,848 --> 02:39:27,599
If you've finished your prayers...

1719
02:39:27,808 --> 02:39:30,602
...perhaps we could begin
our business.

1720
02:39:34,857 --> 02:39:37,817
My dear Jinnah...

1721
02:39:38,069 --> 02:39:40,946
...you and l are brothers...

1722
02:39:41,155 --> 02:39:45,367
...born of the same mother India.
If you have fears...

1723
02:39:45,576 --> 02:39:48,662
...l want to put them at rest.

1724
02:39:48,913 --> 02:39:51,873
Begging the understanding
of my friends...

1725
02:39:52,416 --> 02:39:56,002
...l am asking Panditji
to stand down.

1726
02:39:56,462 --> 02:40:00,465
I want you to be
the first prime minister of lndia...

1727
02:40:00,675 --> 02:40:03,635
...to name your entire cabinet...

1728
02:40:03,844 --> 02:40:07,681
...to make the head of every
government department a Muslim.

1729
02:40:23,155 --> 02:40:24,864
Bapu.

1730
02:40:26,325 --> 02:40:28,493
For me and the rest...

1731
02:40:28,744 --> 02:40:30,870
...if that is what you want...

1732
02:40:31,080 --> 02:40:33,373
...we will accept it.

1733
02:40:34,542 --> 02:40:36,793
But out there...

1734
02:40:37,545 --> 02:40:39,170
...already there is rioting...

1735
02:40:39,380 --> 02:40:43,508
...because Hindus fear you are
going to give too much away.

1736
02:40:44,302 --> 02:40:46,386
If you did this...

1737
02:40:47,013 --> 02:40:49,472
...no one would control it.

1738
02:40:50,057 --> 02:40:51,516
No one.

1739
02:41:07,241 --> 02:41:08,908
It is your choice.

1740
02:41:10,286 --> 02:41:14,456
Do you want an independent lndia
and an independent Pakistan...

1741
02:41:14,832 --> 02:41:17,334
...or do you want civil war?

1742
02:41:54,163 --> 02:41:57,165
Jinnah! Jinnah! Jinnah!

1743
02:44:30,444 --> 02:44:33,947
What you did in Noakhali, Bapu,
was a miracle.

1744
02:44:34,365 --> 02:44:35,907
Miracle.

1745
02:44:36,408 --> 02:44:38,701
But millions are on the move...

1746
02:44:38,911 --> 02:44:41,037
...and no one can count the dead.

1747
02:44:43,290 --> 02:44:47,168
In Calcutta, it's like civil war.

1748
02:44:48,921 --> 02:44:52,549
The Muslims rose
and there was a bloodbath.

1749
02:44:53,634 --> 02:44:56,010
Now the Hindus are taking revenge.

1750
02:44:57,429 --> 02:44:58,930
If we can't stop it...

1751
02:44:59,139 --> 02:45:02,225
...there'll be no hope
for the Hindus left in Pakistan.

1752
02:45:03,477 --> 02:45:06,521
An eye for an eye,
making the whole world blind.

1753
02:45:08,857 --> 02:45:10,441
Aren't there any troops to spare?

1754
02:45:12,111 --> 02:45:18,283
Nothing.

1755
02:45:22,663 --> 02:45:25,707
The divisions in Bombay and Delhi
can hardly keep the peace now.

1756
02:45:25,874 --> 02:45:30,211
And each fresh bit of news creates
another wave of madness.

1757
02:45:30,421 --> 02:45:32,755
We could cut all news off.

1758
02:45:33,340 --> 02:45:35,008
Bapu, please, where are you going?

1759
02:45:35,509 --> 02:45:37,010
I don't want to hear more.

1760
02:45:38,470 --> 02:45:40,221
We need your help.

1761
02:45:40,764 --> 02:45:43,182
There is nothing l can give.

1762
02:45:46,228 --> 02:45:47,478
Where are you going?

1763
02:45:50,858 --> 02:45:52,191
Calcutta.

1764
02:46:35,486 --> 02:46:39,572
If l had shunned death or feared it,
I would not be here now...

1765
02:46:39,782 --> 02:46:41,824
...nor would you be concerned for me.

1766
02:46:42,034 --> 02:46:43,993
But, sir, please.

1767
02:46:44,244 --> 02:46:46,663
I don't have the men to protect you...

1768
02:46:46,872 --> 02:46:49,624
...not in a Muslim house,
not this quarter.

1769
02:46:49,833 --> 02:46:52,960
I'm staying with the friend
of a friend and--

1770
02:46:53,170 --> 02:46:57,131
Death to Muslims!
Death to Muslims!

1771
02:46:58,634 --> 02:47:00,802
Why are you staying
at the home of a Muslim?

1772
02:47:01,053 --> 02:47:02,220
They are murderers!

1773
02:47:02,471 --> 02:47:03,680
They killed my family!

1774
02:47:03,931 --> 02:47:05,890
Get out of Calcutta, Gandhi!

1775
02:47:06,100 --> 02:47:08,893
Death to Muslims!
Death to Muslims!

1776
02:47:57,693 --> 02:47:58,860
Prime Minister.

1777
02:48:03,866 --> 02:48:06,743
Why must l read news
like this in the paper?

1778
02:48:11,832 --> 02:48:14,417
Inform Sardar Patel.
Arrange a plane.

1779
02:48:14,960 --> 02:48:16,127
We will go Friday.

1780
02:48:17,045 --> 02:48:18,129
Four days, sir?

1781
02:48:48,035 --> 02:48:49,702
Bapu.

1782
02:48:51,955 --> 02:48:54,499
Sardar, you have gained weight.

1783
02:48:54,750 --> 02:48:56,959
You must join me in the fast.

1784
02:48:57,169 --> 02:48:59,587
If l fast, I die.

1785
02:49:00,214 --> 02:49:04,383
If you fast, people go to
all sorts of trouble...

1786
02:49:04,593 --> 02:49:05,802
...to keep you alive.

1787
02:49:07,179 --> 02:49:08,805
Bapu, forgive me, I've cheated.

1788
02:49:09,389 --> 02:49:11,516
I could have come earlier...

1789
02:49:11,725 --> 02:49:14,185
...but your fast has helped.

1790
02:49:14,770 --> 02:49:18,481
These last days, people's minds
have begun to turn to this bed...

1791
02:49:18,732 --> 02:49:20,733
...and away from the atrocities.

1792
02:49:20,943 --> 02:49:22,735
But now...

1793
02:49:22,903 --> 02:49:23,945
...it is enough.

1794
02:49:26,615 --> 02:49:30,910
All that has happened is that
I've grown a little thinner.

1795
02:49:34,581 --> 02:49:38,209
Tomorrow, 5000 Muslim students...

1796
02:49:38,418 --> 02:49:39,627
...of all ages...

1797
02:49:39,878 --> 02:49:43,589
...are marching here,
in Calcutta, for peace.

1798
02:49:44,299 --> 02:49:47,927
And 5000 Hindu students
are marching with them.

1799
02:49:49,012 --> 02:49:50,805
I'm glad.

1800
02:49:51,640 --> 02:49:54,559
But it will not be enough.

1801
02:50:07,865 --> 02:50:13,661
Bapu, you are not so young anymore.

1802
02:50:14,121 --> 02:50:15,663
Don't worry for me.

1803
02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:21,669
I cannot watch the destruction
of all that l've lived for.

1804
02:51:30,948 --> 02:51:32,490
Death to Gandhi!

1805
02:51:32,783 --> 02:51:35,076
Who dares say such things?!

1806
02:51:35,452 --> 02:51:36,744
Who?!

1807
02:51:38,038 --> 02:51:40,790
You kill me first!

1808
02:51:41,833 --> 02:51:43,000
Come!

1809
02:51:45,879 --> 02:51:47,296
Where are you?!

1810
02:51:48,215 --> 02:51:49,966
Kill me first!

1811
02:51:52,886 --> 02:51:54,220
Where are you?

1812
02:52:04,690 --> 02:52:08,317
His pulse is very irregular.
The kidneys aren't functioning.

1813
02:52:21,248 --> 02:52:23,457
Bapu?

1814
02:52:23,834 --> 02:52:26,585
I have brought Mr. Suhrawardy.

1815
02:52:26,878 --> 02:52:30,756
It was he who called
on the Muslims to rise.

1816
02:52:31,049 --> 02:52:32,550
He is now telling them...

1817
02:52:33,093 --> 02:52:35,594
...to go back to their homes...

1818
02:52:35,846 --> 02:52:37,763
...to lay down their arms.

1819
02:52:50,235 --> 02:52:52,403
Think what you can do by living...

1820
02:52:52,738 --> 02:52:55,865
...that you cannot do by dying.

1821
02:53:05,459 --> 02:53:07,835
What do you want?

1822
02:53:11,256 --> 02:53:14,050
That the fighting will stop.

1823
02:53:14,259 --> 02:53:16,802
That you make me believe...

1824
02:53:19,723 --> 02:53:22,558
...that it will never start again.

1825
02:53:31,902 --> 02:53:33,069
Sometimes...

1826
02:53:33,278 --> 02:53:37,031
...it is when you are
quite without hope...

1827
02:53:37,741 --> 02:53:40,826
...and in utter darkness...

1828
02:53:41,536 --> 02:53:44,747
...that God comes to the rescue.

1829
02:53:46,625 --> 02:53:48,042
Gandhiji...

1830
02:53:48,502 --> 02:53:50,086
...is dying...

1831
02:53:51,963 --> 02:53:54,632
...because of our madness.

1832
02:53:56,551 --> 02:53:59,136
Put away your revenge.

1833
02:53:59,471 --> 02:54:04,016
What good will come of more killing?

1834
02:54:04,267 --> 02:54:06,602
Have the courage to do...

1835
02:54:06,812 --> 02:54:10,231
...what you know is right.

1836
02:54:10,732 --> 02:54:12,650
For God's sake...

1837
02:54:13,276 --> 02:54:17,279
...let us embrace like brothers.

1838
02:54:31,169 --> 02:54:32,962
It's our promise.

1839
02:54:33,713 --> 02:54:34,964
We stop.

1840
02:54:37,634 --> 02:54:39,593
Hindu swords.

1841
02:54:40,929 --> 02:54:42,555
It's a promise.

1842
02:54:45,725 --> 02:54:47,143
Go.

1843
02:54:48,895 --> 02:54:50,312
God be with you.

1844
02:55:03,285 --> 02:55:04,743
Here, eat!

1845
02:55:06,246 --> 02:55:07,705
Eat!

1846
02:55:08,915 --> 02:55:10,457
I'm going to hell...

1847
02:55:10,876 --> 02:55:13,544
...but not with your death on my soul.

1848
02:55:14,129 --> 02:55:17,464
Only God decides who goes to hell.

1849
02:55:17,841 --> 02:55:19,717
I killed a child.

1850
02:55:21,344 --> 02:55:24,138
I smashed his head against a wall.

1851
02:55:25,891 --> 02:55:27,183
Why?

1852
02:55:29,352 --> 02:55:31,145
They killed my son.

1853
02:55:34,232 --> 02:55:35,608
My boy.

1854
02:55:37,903 --> 02:55:40,154
The Muslims killed my son!

1855
02:55:45,076 --> 02:55:48,787
I know a way out of hell.

1856
02:55:50,123 --> 02:55:52,541
Find a child.

1857
02:55:52,834 --> 02:55:57,838
A child whose mother and father
have been killed.

1858
02:55:58,215 --> 02:56:02,635
A little boy about this high...

1859
02:56:04,304 --> 02:56:06,972
...and raise him as your own.

1860
02:56:10,602 --> 02:56:13,938
Only be sure that he is a Muslim...

1861
02:56:15,732 --> 02:56:18,901
...and that you raise him as one.

1862
02:56:46,638 --> 02:56:50,307
Go.

1863
02:56:51,810 --> 02:56:53,352
God bless you.

1864
02:57:20,088 --> 02:57:26,010
Bapu?

1865
02:57:27,679 --> 02:57:29,972
There's been no fighting...

1866
02:57:30,598 --> 02:57:31,682
...anywhere.

1867
02:57:33,018 --> 02:57:34,476
It's stopped.

1868
02:57:35,270 --> 02:57:37,855
The madness has stopped.

1869
02:57:41,943 --> 02:57:43,527
It's foolish...

1870
02:57:43,737 --> 02:57:47,364
...if it's just to save
the life of an old man.

1871
02:57:47,615 --> 02:57:52,619
No. In every temple and mosque...

1872
02:57:52,996 --> 02:57:55,080
...they have pledged to die...

1873
02:57:55,332 --> 02:57:58,334
...before they lift a hand
against each other.

1874
02:58:00,837 --> 02:58:02,588
It is true, Bapu.

1875
02:58:10,764 --> 02:58:12,556
Everywhere.

1876
02:58:47,217 --> 02:58:49,551
Maulana, my friend...

1877
02:58:51,596 --> 02:58:54,139
...could I have some orange juice?

1878
02:59:01,022 --> 02:59:02,689
Then you and l...

1879
02:59:02,899 --> 02:59:05,776
...will take a piece
of bread together.

1880
02:59:36,015 --> 02:59:38,225
He will be saying prayers
in the garden.

1881
02:59:46,693 --> 02:59:48,527
That is how you eat muli.

1882
02:59:49,404 --> 02:59:52,030
I'm not sure that I want
to be remembered that way.

1883
02:59:52,240 --> 02:59:54,366
Don't worry.
With luck, you may not be.

1884
02:59:54,576 --> 02:59:58,203
No, he will be remembered
for tempting fate.

1885
02:59:59,372 --> 03:00:01,206
Mickey Mouse!

1886
03:00:02,417 --> 03:00:04,418
You're really going to Pakistan?

1887
03:00:09,299 --> 03:00:11,175
You are a stubborn man.

1888
03:00:13,261 --> 03:00:15,220
I'm simply going to prove...

1889
03:00:15,430 --> 03:00:18,015
...to Hindus here and Muslims there...

1890
03:00:18,266 --> 03:00:21,477
...that the only devils
in the world are those...

1891
03:00:21,728 --> 03:00:24,188
...running around in our own hearts.

1892
03:00:24,772 --> 03:00:28,233
And that is where all our battles
ought to be fought.

1893
03:00:28,443 --> 03:00:30,110
Bapu.

1894
03:00:35,867 --> 03:00:40,662
So, what kind of warrior have you
been in that warfare?

1895
03:00:42,290 --> 03:00:44,041
Not a very good one.

1896
03:00:44,250 --> 03:00:46,960
That's why I have
so much tolerance...

1897
03:00:47,170 --> 03:00:50,422
...for the other scoundrels
of the world.

1898
03:00:54,844 --> 03:00:56,512
Sardar?

1899
03:00:56,679 --> 03:01:00,182
Ask Panditji to consider
what we've discussed.

1900
03:01:06,648 --> 03:01:08,857
-Enough!
-One more.

1901
03:01:09,192 --> 03:01:11,902
-You're a temptress!
-Just an admirer.

1902
03:01:12,153 --> 03:01:14,279
Nothing's more dangerous...

1903
03:01:14,531 --> 03:01:16,698
...especially for an old man.

1904
03:01:26,167 --> 03:01:28,377
There's a sadness about him.

1905
03:01:29,921 --> 03:01:31,505
He thinks he's failed.

1906
03:01:31,756 --> 03:01:33,173
Why?

1907
03:01:33,424 --> 03:01:36,885
If anything's proven him right,
it's these last months.

1908
03:01:38,596 --> 03:01:41,139
I may be blinded by my love for him...

1909
03:01:41,891 --> 03:01:43,183
...but l believe...

1910
03:01:43,434 --> 03:01:45,602
...when we most needed it...

1911
03:01:45,812 --> 03:01:48,981
...he offered the world
a way out of madness.

1912
03:01:51,693 --> 03:01:53,026
But he doesn't see it.

1913
03:01:53,987 --> 03:01:55,904
Neither does the world.

1914
03:02:29,397 --> 03:02:31,565
Brother, Bapu is already
late for prayers.

1915
03:02:34,360 --> 03:02:36,153
Oh, God!

1916
03:02:36,946 --> 03:02:38,905
Oh, God.

1917
03:03:17,612 --> 03:03:19,613
When l despair...

1918
03:03:19,906 --> 03:03:21,823
...I remember...

1919
03:03:22,158 --> 03:03:24,409
...that all through history...

1920
03:03:24,619 --> 03:03:29,122
...the way of truth and love
has always won.

1921
03:03:30,958 --> 03:03:34,544
There have been tyrants
and murderers...

1922
03:03:34,796 --> 03:03:37,839
...and for a time,
they can seem invincible...

1923
03:03:38,049 --> 03:03:41,468
...but in the end, they always fall.

1924
03:03:43,179 --> 03:03:44,721
Think of it.
