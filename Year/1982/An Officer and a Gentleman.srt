00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:20,496
<i>Passengers arriving on Philippine Airlines
Flight 118...</i>

2
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:25,001
<i>welcome to Manila International Airport.
Those passengers....</i>

3
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,759
Hey.

4
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:43,311
- Hey, kid. Are you Zack?
- Yes, sir.

5
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,355
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.

6
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,110
- Come on. Let's get your bags. Okay?
- Yes, sir.

7
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,160
Take your jacket off, kid.
It's hot as hell here.

8
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:03,998
This is the P.I.
It's what we call the Philippine Islands.

9
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:10,630
Zack, I'm sorry about what happened to your mom.
It must've been rough.

10
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:14,926
I would have called you a lot sooner,
but I was out at sea.

11
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:19,263
But I've been calling you for four months.

12
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:25,853
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I was out at sea for four months.

13
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,997
All right, kid.
These are your mama-sans, Tiki and Maria.

14
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,500
Hello, Byron.

15
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:53,339
Come here. I want you to meet somebody.
This is my son, Zack.

16
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:57,218
Tiki, say hello. Zack, Tiki and Maria.

17
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:59,804
- Hi, Zack.
- Hi, Zack.

18
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:10,356
<i>I'm out at sea three weeks
out of every month.</i>

19
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:15,444
When I'm in port, I don't have time
for daddy stuff. That's not who I am.

20
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,448
- That's okay, sir.
- Kid, you don't understand.

21
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,493
I'm too old for this.
I don't care what the Navy says.

22
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,621
This is no place to bring up a kid.
I told you on the telephone.

23
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:30,459
- You're better off in that state school in Virginia.
- I'm never going back! They treat me like shit.

24
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:35,339
Maybe that's not for you to say!
Goddamn it, don't look at me that way!

25
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:38,092
What happened to your mother
had nothing to do with me!

26
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,678
It did.
You said you were going to come back!

27
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:45,516
Is that what she said? That's a female lie.
That's bullshit! That's a lie!

28
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:49,186
I found your letters.
I read them after she did it.

29
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,148
You said you were gonna come back.
You said you loved her.

30
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:55,818
<i>And she believed you. You're a liar.</i>

31
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,963
Motherfucker.

32
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,725
- Handsome.
- Grow up, boy. I'll wait for you.

33
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:31,145
You want to go to school?
I'll teach you nice.

34
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:38,986
Chicken feet, monkey meat.
Come on, you buy. Buy! Monkey meat.

35
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,407
Hey, sailor. What ship are you from?

36
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,074
Hey, what are you doing?

37
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:30,204
- Big spender. Give us your money!
- I don't have any money.

38
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,081
- Bullshit, get it out!
- No!

39
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,905
Leave me alone!

40
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,051
Leave me alone.

41
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,653
Holy shit!

42
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,535
- Watch it. I gotta heave.
- Jesus Christ.

43
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,631
Give me a towel.

44
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,435
Pretty fucking wild.

45
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,313
Holy shit.

46
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,276
Not as wild as that night
we banged three stewardesses in Manila.

47
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:47,364
Bet you didn't get it on like that
in that jerk-water college you graduated from.

48
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:59,168
How long are you going
to hang around Seattle?

49
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,840
Get ready, man.
This one is gonna blow you away.

50
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,669
Nothing you do is ever going
to surprise me.

51
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,807
- Tell me.
- I joined the Navy.

52
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,936
- You joined the Navy?
- That's right. I joined the Navy.

53
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:23,734
I'm on my way over to Port Rainier now,
this officer's training school over there.

54
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:29,824
- What for?
- Jets. I want to fly jets.

55
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:36,330
This place is only a couple of hours from here.
Maybe you want to come visit. All right?

56
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,333
Who put that idea in your head?

57
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,820
Nobody. It just come to me.

58
00:07:43,188 --> 00:07:45,006
What's so funny?

59
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,844
You, man. It's like saying you're going
to run for fucking president.

60
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,974
For Christ's sake, look at yourself.

61
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,228
Officers don't have tattoos.

62
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,525
- Look, I'll see you, man. All right?
- Hey.

63
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:09,196
- Zack, don't be pissed off.
- I'm not pissed off.

64
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:13,576
Yeah, you are pissed off.
Come on. I'm on your side.

65
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:16,954
I don't want to see you do something
you're going to regret.

66
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,501
You gotta give six years to the Navy
if you want to fly.

67
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:27,840
Six fucking years with the most uptight assholes
God put on this earth.

68
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:32,094
Officers, man, they're not like you and me.
They're a different breed.

69
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,888
You know what this sounds like?

70
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,558
Sounds like you're afraid
you might have to salute me some day, chief.

71
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:42,062
- Bullshit. Why would I be afraid of that?
- I don't know. It sounds that way.

72
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,274
You want some fatherly bullshit,
a pat on the back.

73
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,152
From you? No.

74
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:53,657
Thanks for my graduation present.
See you around.

75
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:58,996
Zack, don't go away mad.
Hey, babe. Zack, come on.

76
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,165
Zack!

77
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,668
Fall in!

78
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,504
I said, fall in, you slimy worms!

79
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,424
Put your toes on the edge
of that chalk line!

80
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:21,638
I said, put your toes on the edge
of this chalk line, you slimy worms!

81
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:26,060
Attention!

82
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,315
I don't believe what I'm seeing.

83
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:34,818
Where have you been all your lives,
at an orgy?

84
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:39,990
Listening to Mick Jagger music
and bad-mouthing your country, I bet.

85
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:46,330
Stop eyeballing me. You're not worthy
of looking your superiors in the eye.

86
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:50,501
- Use peripheral vision. Understand?
- Yes, sir.

87
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:54,838
Every time I say "understand,"
I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir."

88
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:56,599
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

89
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,009
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

90
00:11:59,177 --> 00:12:03,180
I know why most of you are here.

91
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,891
I'm not stupid.

92
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,521
Before you get to sell what we teach you
over at United Airlines...

93
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:14,775
you've got to give the Navy
six years of your lives, sweet pea.

94
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:20,072
Lots of things can happen in six years.
Another war can come up in six years.

95
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,159
If you're too peaceful a person
to dump napalm on an enemy village...

96
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,370
where there might be women and children...

97
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:28,664
I'm going to find that out.

98
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:30,424
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

99
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,584
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

100
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,339
Hi, son.

101
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:40,134
How are you doing, sarge?

102
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,719
What did you call me?

103
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,472
- Pardon?
- What did you call me, boy?

104
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,767
- I called you "sarge."
- Before that.

105
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,562
- I didn't call you anything.
- You said, "How are you?"

106
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,357
I am not a ewe, boy.
A ewe is a female sheep.

107
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,068
- Is that what you think I am, boy?
- No.

108
00:12:58,236 --> 00:12:59,695
- No, sir!
- No, sir.

109
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,072
- Louder, sweet pea.
- No, sir!

110
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:07,953
You want to fuck me up the ass?
Is that why you called me a ewe, boy?

111
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,206
- Are you a queer?
- Hell no, sir.

112
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:14,626
- Where are you from?
- Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, sir.

113
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:19,256
Only two things come out of Oklahoma.

114
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,926
Steers and queers.

115
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:25,262
Which one are you, boy?

116
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:29,641
I don't see no horns,
so you must be a queer.

117
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,977
- No, sir.
- Stop whispering.

118
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,230
- You're giving me a hard-on.
- No, sir!

119
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,452
- Were you laughing at me, dick brain?
- No, sir!

120
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,913
Better stop eyeballing me, boy.

121
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,750
I'll rip your eyeballs out of the sockets
and skull fuck you to death.

122
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:57,836
- Yes, sir!
- What's your name, boy?

123
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,797
Mayo. Zack Mayo, sir.

124
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:06,720
How did you slip into this program?
I didn't know the Navy was so hard up.

125
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,020
You got an injury there, Mayo?

126
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,981
Not exactly, sir.

127
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:26,490
Hey. This is really wonderful work.
Where did you get this, Mayo?

128
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,359
Subic Base, Philippines, sir.

129
00:14:29,327 --> 00:14:32,412
Thought I recognized the work.

130
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,751
Be proud of them wings. They're the only ones
you're gonna leave here with...

131
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,295
Mayonnaise.

132
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,396
- What's your name, boy?
- Emiliano Santos Della Serra, sir.

133
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:01,483
You don't say.
Are you a college boy, Della Serra?

134
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:06,238
Yes, sir. Math major, sir.
Graduated from Texas Tech with honors, sir.

135
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,864
I see.

136
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:14,329
Do you see this cane, Della Serra?
See the notches near the handle?

137
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:17,291
There's a notch for every college puke, like you...

138
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,336
who I got to D.O.R., that's drop on request,
from this program.

139
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:27,509
And the first one I'm going to carve out
of this class is you, Emiliano.

140
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:30,846
I expect to lose half of you
before I'm finished.

141
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:35,684
I will use every means necessary,
fair and unfair, to trip you up.

142
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:40,147
To expose your weaknesses
as a potential aviator and human being.

143
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:42,691
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

144
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:48,113
The prize at the other end
is a flight education worth $1 million.

145
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:52,659
But first you've got to get past me.

146
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:04,838
Hey, Paula! It's 5:00!
Where's the goddamn whistle?

147
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,674
<i>Three.</i>

148
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,427
Oh, shit.

149
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,766
Come on, Paula.
Let's go. Turn that thing off.

150
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,102
Next.

151
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,563
Oh, shit.

152
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:30,113
Now, this is my idea of an ass bandit.

153
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:33,325
Wait till some of the local girls
get a look at you, scrotum head.

154
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,910
Scrotum head.

155
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:37,871
You think that's funny, Worley?

156
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:42,125
Not all the obstacles that can trip you up
are on this base.

157
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,836
Let me tell you something
about the local girls.

158
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,214
Ever since there's been a naval base here...

159
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,342
there's been what you might call
the Puget Sound debs.

160
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:54,763
That's poor girls coming across the sound
on the ferry every weekend...

161
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:58,058
with just one thing in mind.

162
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:02,896
And that's to marry themselves a naval aviator.

163
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:14,408
<i>You want me to leave
You want me to stay</i>

164
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:18,620
<i>A Puget deb will tell you,
"Don't worry about contraceptives.</i>

165
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:23,667
<i>I got that all taken care of."
Don't you believe a word of it.</i>

166
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:28,046
<i>A Puget deb will do and say anything
to trap you.</i>

167
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:33,844
<i>I know this sounds silly to you,
especially in this modern age...</i>

168
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,764
<i>but you college pukes had better watch out,
because they're out there...</i>

169
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:40,976
<i>and you, sweet peas,
are the answer to their dreams.</i>

170
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:44,521
<i>Treat me right</i>

171
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:47,357
<i>Treat me right</i>

172
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:54,322
<i>Open your eyes, maybe you'll see the light</i>

173
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,993
<i>Oh, treat me right</i>

174
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:01,413
All right, hurry up! On the double now!

175
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,124
You lard asses, I'm going to fix you.

176
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:08,837
Come on! Get up there! Quick!
On the double, Mayonnaise!

177
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:13,425
Come on! Little-girl poopies to the left,
little-boy poopies to the right.

178
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:20,015
Come on, let's go.
What a motley bunch. Get in there.

179
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:23,226
All right, quick. On the double!

180
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,781
How's it going?

181
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:40,869
You got to be kidding.
How do they expect me to get down in there?

182
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,374
- One of you want to switch bunks?
- Those are assigned.

183
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,585
Yeah, I don't think we can.

184
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:58,553
- Who the hell is that guy?
- Your mom and dad for the next 13 weeks.

185
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:03,308
All right, fall out!
Get outside, on the double. Come on out here!

186
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,937
Quick! Out the door! On the double!

187
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:12,651
Quick! Quick! Quick!
More! More! More!

188
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,154
You and you, get down and give me 50.
Count them.

189
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,989
Count them!

190
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,410
You think there's truth
to what he said about those girls?

191
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,703
Puget debs?

192
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:27,290
- Sure there is, sweet pea.
- Still?

193
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:31,586
Should have warned you female types
about the Puget dudes.

194
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:35,423
They say they're wearing a rubber,
but there's a hole in the bottom.

195
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:39,344
- Very funny, Mayo.
- Seeger! Mayo! Worley!

196
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:41,930
If you got energy to run those sewers...

197
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:46,142
get over there and give me 50!
On the double! Right now!

198
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:51,481
All right, poopie-asses,
get your faces down there!

199
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:55,861
Pump them out!
You women better not expect special privileges.

200
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,781
You think flying a plane is just
sitting on a chair pushing buttons?

201
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:03,994
Looks like you need a little work
in your upper-body strength, Seeger.

202
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,586
All right, all right.
Get up. Get up!

203
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,171
Step out.

204
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:20,302
Get back in line. You watch. Go on!

205
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,389
Pilots off the Lexington ought to be getting
to the officer's club now.

206
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,183
You sure got the timetable down, Lynette.

207
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,895
After three years, you learn all the tricks.

208
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,231
Did you see that bodacious set of ta-tas?

209
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:38,320
Hi, Mrs. Rufferwell. I brought the records
the social committee asked for.

210
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,407
You're pissing me off, boys.

211
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,076
Thirty-eight, 39....

212
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:49,164
The Blue Angels will be in next month.
You need an introduction, let me know.

213
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,917
- Bye, for now.
- Bye.

214
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,094
Far fucking out!

215
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:58,256
I've been wanting to meet one of those
Blue Angels since I can remember.

216
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,051
Look at the poopies. Poor guys.

217
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,011
See you in a month when you get liberty!

218
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,889
Don't worry, it grows out an inch by then!

219
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:10,393
Ain't gonna be no liberty for you, boys.
You'll be going home before then.

220
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:16,441
- Start from one again. One....
- Two, three....

221
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:22,614
- <i>Flying low and feeling mean</i>
- <i>Flying low and feeling mean</i>

222
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:28,787
- <i>Spot a family by the stream</i>

00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:34,626
- <i>Pickle a pair and hear them scream</i>

224
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:39,881

225
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:43,009
- That is disgusting!
- What are you doing here, Seeger?

226
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,220
Am I threatening you?

227
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:48,264
We'll send you to war.
Get your ass shot down.

228
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,393
I wouldn't mind being the first woman
to fly fighters in combat.

229
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,436
- Go in my place.
- Going for jets?

230
00:21:53,904 --> 00:21:55,689
- All the way.
- How about you, Mayo?

231
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,983
- Jets.
- I hate to tell you...

232
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,569
but they only let two of each class go to jets.
Which one of you is going with me?

233
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,196
- Me.
- Me.

234
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:08,243
Talking in the ranks again.
You three just added two miles to this hike.

235
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:10,328
For everybody. Come on, let's go.

236
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:17,919
- <i>Family of gooks are sitting in a ditch</i>
- <i>Family of gooks are sitting in a ditch</i>

237
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:24,009
- <i>Little baby's sucking on his momma's tit</i>
- <i>Little baby's sucking on his momma's tit</i>

238
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:30,223
- <i>Chemical firms don't give a shit</i>
- <i>Chemical firms don't give a shit</i>

239
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:36,271
- <i>That napalm sticks to kids</i>
- <i>That napalm sticks to kids</i>

240
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,650
Get over there! Let's go!

241
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,079
Move it up here! Get up here!

242
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:20,482
All right, everybody up!
Up on your feet!

243
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,526
I don't want to see nothing coming out
of your mouths either!

244
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:28,823
Come on! Let's go! Get into shape around here!
Stand straight up!

245
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,577
All right, get out of the way!

246
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:37,957
- <i>Lift your head and hold it high</i>
- <i>Lift your head and hold it high</i>

247
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,336
<i>The best in the regiment is running on by</i>

248
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:45,340
<i>The best in the regiment is running on by</i>

249
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,804
That could be you at the end of 13 weeks.

250
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:55,725
For those of you who might survive.
You don't deserve to look at them!

251
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:58,228
Della Serra, turn your back!

252
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:03,691
You are without a doubt the most pathetic class
I've ever been assigned to.

253
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:09,823
You chump. Four weeks and you still
can't shine a damn buckle.

254
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,451
Shoot me a Kotex, buddy.

255
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,162
Be careful where you stick that.

256
00:24:20,251 --> 00:24:22,919
Five minutes to inspection, Mayo.

257
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,754
Where's your money?

258
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,391
Boonies.

259
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:41,688
You better hope Foley
never finds out about that, Mayo.

260
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,482
Hey, Perryman?

261
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,944
Look what I've got here, man.

262
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:54,868
Look at that.
Look at them buckles, man.

263
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,515
Look good, huh?

264
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,745
Ten bucks.

265
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:01,499
- Fifteen for the boonies.
- Who the hell's got 10 bucks?

266
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:06,212
I spend every penny they pay me
to keep my old lady and my kid in that motel.

267
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,631
You're breaking my heart, Perryman.

268
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,759
Who have you got
doing this stuff for you?

269
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,388
Some enlisted guy, right?

270
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:21,686
- Hey, tell me something.
- Watch the sheets, man.

271
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:25,315
Look, is that change
you're making from that stuff...

272
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,461
worth all of us getting kicked out of here
on an honor's violation?

273
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:35,992
I don't see anybody else complaining
about it, Perryman. Excuse me.

274
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,661
Ready? Go.

275
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,651
- Look out, Worley, coming through.
- The hell you say.

276
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,861
Here I come.

277
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:16,241
Out of my way, Mayo.
Gonna put my name on that wall.

278
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,410
- Underneath mine.
- Fuck!

279
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,296
Give me the rope, give me the rope.

280
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,800
Shit!

281
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:40,433
Goddamn, Mayonnaise.

282
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:56,114
Two twenty-five. Not bad for a beginner.

283
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,157
Piece of cake.

284
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,577
Let's go now! Come on, Schneider!
Come on, Schneider!

285
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,289
Let's go! Let's go!

286
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,018
Let's go! You guys are bringing up the rear!

287
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:31,774
You ain't getting out of here
until you get over that wall, Seeger.

288
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:34,736
- I'll make it, sir!
- Hurry up.

289
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,531
Come on, get over there!

290
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,494
You really want to be a man?

291
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,873
You one of those little girls
who didn't get your daddy's attention...

292
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:50,043
because he wanted a son, Seeger?

293
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,756
That's it. That's what's
will beat you every time, Seeger.

294
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,967
Your mental attitude of a person
of the female persuasion.

295
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:01,262
Deep down, under all that bullshit...

296
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:05,141
you're still thinking
like a second-class citizen, Seeger.

297
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:07,894
You can never give orders to men!

298
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:13,441
Walk around.
Walk around, sugar breeches.

299
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:19,322
Bernoulli's equation gives us
the total energy contained in the air flow.

300
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:23,785
P is static pressure
in pounds per square foot.

301
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,330
Rho is air density
in slugs per cubic foot.

302
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:31,000
And velocity is in feet per second.

303
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:34,379
Two thousand pounds per square foot
for your static pressure.

304
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:39,675
An air density of one, which is sea level.
A velocity of 100 knots.

305
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,429
Solve the total amount of energy
in the air flow.

306
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,524
Let's see them.

307
00:28:55,651 --> 00:28:57,777
All right. What about the buckles?

308
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:06,661
- Okay, all right. 20 bucks, right?
- Hey, bud.

309
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:09,831
Beat it.

310
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,709
What are you laughing about?

311
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:16,129
- I thought that's how you did it.
- Did what?

312
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,266
Did what? Come on, Santa Claus.

313
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:24,512
- You're not gonna tell anybody, are you?
- Not if you make it worth my while.

314
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,142
Free boonies for the duration.
That's fair.

315
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,727
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

316
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:36,399
You get me through aerodynamics,
you can write your own ticket, my friend.

317
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:41,571
You got a deal.

318
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,542
<i>I'm comin' home, I've done my time</i>

319
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:59,088
<i>And I got to know what is and isn't mine</i>

320
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:04,469
<i>If you received my letter
Telling you I'd soon be free</i>

321
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:08,723
<i>Then you'll know just what to do
If you still want me</i>

322
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:13,394
<i>If you still want me</i>

323
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:17,482
George Jones, where are you
when we need you most?

324
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:20,776
<i>It's been three long years</i>

325
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,279
<i>Do ya still want me</i>

326
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:26,532
<i>If I don't see a ribbon
'Round the ole oak tree</i>

327
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,494
Hey, two o'clock.
Moving in, Della Serra.

328
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:33,240
Radar's up, scoping the target area.

329
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,921
Zero in, slick it back. There he goes.

330
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,758
Who will be the lucky deb?
Is it the blond? Is it the brunette?

331
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:48,179
Score! He's got her.

332
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,848
Oh, my God. Check Perryman.

333
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:55,645
Five years of marriage, still in love.
It's what life's all about.

334
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,944
Hey, Seeger.

335
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:10,326
Remember that bodacious set
of ta-tas and her pal?

336
00:31:10,953 --> 00:31:13,579
There they are, bud.

337
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:18,042
I think we ought to do something about it.

338
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,717
Captain, it's so nice to meet you.

339
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,136
The boys speak so highly of you.

340
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:33,307
- Lynette, he has several people to meet.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

341
00:31:33,675 --> 00:31:34,776
Captain Rufferwell.

342
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,397
- Mrs. Rufferwell?
- Hello, captain.

343
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:47,280
Could you introduce us
to these two young ladies, please?

344
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,157
Paula, Lynette.

345
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,620
Miss Paula Pokrifki,
Miss Lynette Pomeroy.

346
00:31:54,788 --> 00:32:00,376
May I present Officer Candidate Sid Worley
and Officer Candidate Zachary Mayo.

347
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:04,422
Well, I hope you have a good time.

348
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,302
- We already met.
- We did?

349
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,640
You said it would grow an inch by now.

350
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:19,020
- That was you guys?
- Yeah.

351
00:32:23,317 --> 00:32:26,986
- Would you like to dance?
- Sure.

352
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,782
It's grown out more than an inch, pal.

353
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:36,621
<i>'Cause I couldn't bear
To see what I might see</i>

354
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:41,459
<i>I'm really still in prison
<i>And my love, she holds the key</i>

355
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,378
<i>A simple yellow ribbon's what I need</i>

356
00:32:44,546 --> 00:32:48,132
- Would you like to get a drink?
- Sure.

357
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,593
Let's go.

358
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:58,392
- So, what kind of a name is Pokrifki?
- Polish.

359
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,688
- What kind of a name is Mayo?
- Italian. My mom was Irish.

360
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:05,066
- No, thank you.
- I think I got her ears.

361
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,525
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

362
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,153
The rest is all wop.

363
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,156
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?

364
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:16,744
Everywhere, nowhere, Paula the Polack.

365
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:21,374
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

366
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:25,961
- My father is a rear admiral, 7th Fleet.
- You're kidding.

367
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:28,839
No, we've lived in ports
all over the world.

368
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,593
Kathmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.

369
00:33:32,761 --> 00:33:37,098
Really? I've never been out of Washington.

370
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:41,727
Wait a minute.
You're kidding me, right?

371
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:45,648
- We don't have any naval bases in Moscow.
- No.

372
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:48,901
No, I didn't think so.

373
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:53,989
So, uh, you got a girl, Mayo the Wop?

374
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:57,159
No.

375
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,246
I ain't looking for one either.

376
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,834
What are you looking for?

377
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:13,968
You know, I heard about these girls
that come to these things looking for a husband.

378
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,138
Not me.

379
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,182
Oh, yeah? Why are you here?

380
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:24,061
To meet interesting people, improve myself.

381
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:30,151
- What do you do? Go to school?
- No, I've got a job.

382
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:34,029
I work over at National Paper.
It's a real good job.

383
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:37,158
I'm going to save enough money to travel.

384
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:40,161
I think I'd like to go to Moscow.

385
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:48,586
Have you been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?

386
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:53,758
No, but my father and my brother both made it,
so I guess I can too.

387
00:34:53,925 --> 00:35:00,055
- Is your brother a flyer?
- He was. He got killed.

388
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,808
- Vietnam?
- Yeah.

389
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:09,148
My brother died over there too.
He wasn't a flyer, though.

390
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:15,446
I was only 12 when it happened.
I don't remember much about him.

391
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:22,787
I sure remember Tommy. Do you mind
if we talk about something else?

392
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,793
We don't have to talk about anything at all.

393
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:10,334
So do you think you'll make it all the way
to getting your wings?

394
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:16,465
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me
have been dropping out like flies.

395
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:20,803
You gotta say you're going to do it.
You gotta program yourself.

396
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:24,557
It'll happen.
You gotta see yourself making it.

397
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:29,019
I know, because I read this article
in <i>Cosmo</i> about that very thing.

398
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,397
I swear.

399
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,483
Paula.

400
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:38,946
You are a very, very pretty girl.

401
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,711
Do you want to go somewhere else?

402
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,755
Come on.

403
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,177
Fall out, Worley.

404
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:16,650
Something tells me you girls
have been here before.

405
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:19,987
Whatever gave you that idea?

406
00:37:22,948 --> 00:37:26,160
- Stop it. You're gonna ruin it.
- I'm sorry.

407
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:28,787
I'll do it.

408
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:37,588
Are you sure this is okay?

409
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,800
Don't worry. I'll respect you in the morning.

410
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,345
You're crazy, girl.

411
00:37:44,554 --> 00:37:47,681
You'll respect me.

412
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:59,652
I couldn't wait to get out of there.

413
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:03,364
- Didn't you like the band?
- Not much.

414
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,525
You didn't like "Tie A Yellow Ribbon"?

415
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:09,203
Their rendition was one of the--

416
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:26,762
- Let's go down to the beach.
- That sounds good.

417
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,189
Class, halt!

418
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,817
Fall out!

419
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:05,801
Look at Foley. Can you believe it?
Showboating.

420
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:08,303
All right, listen up.

421
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:11,640
I am the base martial arts instructor.

422
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:15,102
Those of you in 1-5 must desist
in thinking of me...

423
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,604
as the drill instructor for the next 60 minutes.

424
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,441
Just think of me as the enemy.

425
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:23,110
Do you believe this guy?

426
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:27,156
May I have a volunteer, please?

427
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:31,201
Daniels. I see you hiding back there.
Get up here quick.

428
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,538
- Put him in the hospital.
- He can't touch me, it's against the law.

429
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,331
- Kick his ass.
- Let's go.

430
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:40,753
Come on up here, son.

431
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:50,512
Hello, pussy.
How bad do you want to survive?

432
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,308
Sir, this officer candidate doesn't understand
the drill instructor's question, sir.

433
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,312
Let's see if I can clarify it.

434
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,944
You want to survive bad enough
to stop me, pussy?

435
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:10,824
Are you relying on my generosity
to stop me from killing you?

436
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,576
Can't breathe.

437
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,205
Break loose, break loose!

438
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:19,541
I can't breathe.

439
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,837
Get away from here.

440
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:31,386
You're not hurt. I could have killed you
if I wanted to. Move off.

441
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:36,850
Get out of here. Hurry up.
Get back to your seat.

442
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:43,732
You think I was really harsh
on your classmate, don't you?

443
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,611
Just wait till you get shot down
behind enemy lines.

444
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:52,157
The only thing between you and a POW camp
is what you learn from me.

445
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:59,915
Now that I've got your attention,
we shall proceed with the class.

446
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:21,478
God, I hope she shows.

447
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,815
She's going to show.
She will show.

448
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:29,111
A rich, socialite Okie like you
ought to be a big catch around these parts.

449
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:31,738
- I ain't rich.
- You're an officer's kid.

450
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,949
So what?

451
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:43,542
Man, I spent six years living on top
of the raunchiest whorehouse in the P.I.

452
00:41:48,298 --> 00:41:51,091
You want number one fucky-fucky?

453
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:56,180
Long time, short time.
Ten dollars. Cheap-cheap.

454
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,892
- Ten bucks?
- Ten dollars. Ten dollars.

455
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:08,525
- Lynette, honey, how's it hanging?
- Don't drool on her, boy.

456
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,777
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

457
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,451
Pansy-assed fly boys.

458
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:29,421
- I remember you. Mayo the Wop.
- Yeah, that's me.

459
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,884
It's good to see you.

460
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:38,388
I was looking forward to it.

461
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,766
Me too.

462
00:42:45,228 --> 00:42:46,414
Excuse me.

463
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:53,154
You guys want to hang out here,
or can I suggest an alternate plan?

464
00:42:54,322 --> 00:42:58,126
- Like pick up a bottle and go to a motel?
- Just like that.

465
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,205
What do you think?

466
00:43:03,373 --> 00:43:06,333
I vote for a motel.

467
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:09,163
My kind of group.

468
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:15,926
Troy, here they come.

469
00:43:19,806 --> 00:43:23,433
Well, make way for the warmongers.

470
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:29,314
- What did you call us?
- A warmonger. Ain't that what you are?

471
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,650
Yeah, all right.

472
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:42,953
I thought he wanted to dance with you.

473
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:48,959
- I'd like to ask you something.
- What do you want?

474
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:53,213
You come up here for a couple of months,
you rich college boys.

475
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:57,884
You're strutting around in your ice-cream outfits
like you own the place.

476
00:43:58,094 --> 00:44:02,889
- Who do you think you are?
- I don't want to fight you.

477
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:07,394
I do not want to fight.
Why don't you go inside and cool down?

478
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:09,521
I ain't finished talking to you, sailor boy.

479
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:13,233
Get him, Troy.

480
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:22,117
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, back off, man.

481
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:28,248
- That's enough, man.
- Holy shit, check his nose.

482
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:34,796
- He broke his nose.
- You asshole!

483
00:44:36,841 --> 00:44:38,467
Come on.

484
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:42,763
I've never seen anything like that
in my whole life.

485
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:48,727
- Did you see that guy's nose?
- Shut up until we get to the motel.

486
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:52,397
Excuse me for living.

487
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,691
Asshole.

488
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:59,821
I shouldn't have done it.
I should have walked away.

489
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:05,410
- Zack, he didn't give you a choice.
- Everybody's always got a choice.

490
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:20,550
- Where did you learn to fight like that?
- I don't want to talk about it now.

491
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,552
All right.

492
00:45:30,812 --> 00:45:34,356
Zack, it wouldn't kill you
to open up to me a little bit.

493
00:45:36,067 --> 00:45:38,527
What do you want? You want to fuck?

494
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:42,197
Come here. Get on the bed.
Take your clothes off.

495
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:45,158
- I'll give you a good fuck.
- Where's that coming from?

496
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:46,743
Get on the bed.

497
00:45:46,911 --> 00:45:50,789
- I wouldn't fuck you now if my life--
- Then get the hell out of here! I don't need this.

498
00:45:50,957 --> 00:45:56,002
I don't know who you think you're talking to.
I'm not some whore you brought in here.

499
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:01,800
- I'm trying to be your friend.
- Then be a friend. Get out of here.

500
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,719
Fine. Fine.

501
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:10,183
You ain't nothing special. No manners!
You treat women like whores.

502
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:14,521
If you ask me, you ain't got no chance
of being no officer.

503
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:26,592
Hey.

504
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:35,250
It's okay. It's all right.

505
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,505
I'm sorry.

506
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:43,091
I'm sorry.

507
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:30,597
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah, I'm starved.

508
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:44,903
- Skivvies?
- Pretty sexy, huh?

509
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:47,822
- Sporty.
- Control yourself, baby.

510
00:47:58,992 --> 00:48:00,010
Good.

511
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,890
Look, Paula....

512
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:21,064
I try hard not to fool anybody
about who I am, what I want.

513
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:26,069
- So if you got--
- I know who you are and what you want.

514
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:31,950
- What do you want?
- A good time until you have to leave.

515
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:33,253
That's it?

516
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,127
Hey.

517
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:47,340
- Last night was incredible.
- I thought so too.

518
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:52,887
- Zack, am I your fantasy?
- What?

519
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:58,268
I'm not going to get serious on you,
but I dare you not to fall in love with me.

520
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:01,813
I mean, how can you resist?
I'm like candy.

521
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,734
You are better than candy.

522
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:10,614
It's going to be very hard to get enough.
Very hard. Very hard.

523
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,199
Getting feisty on me, you little Polack?

524
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,335
You little cocky Polack.

525
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:34,554
What do you do with a girl
when you're through with her, huh?

526
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:36,557
Do you say something,
or do you just disappear?

527
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:43,688
I've never had a girl.

528
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:56,910
- I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
- Any time, sailor.

529
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,625
Heads up, Perryman.

530
00:50:03,793 --> 00:50:07,545
When you hit the water,
you might get the wind knocked out of you.

531
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,923
Don't panic.

532
00:50:10,091 --> 00:50:13,760
You've got a second and a half
before the cage is underwater...

533
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:17,013
and it flips upside down. Go, Joe.

534
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:31,403
The most important thing
is to watch your bubbles.

535
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:36,825
When that cage flips upside down,
you're gonna be disoriented.

536
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:41,496
Like Perryman down there.
The bubbles will determine which way is up.

537
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:43,039
Holy shit.

538
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:47,085
All right, time's up.
Go down for him, Jason.

539
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:50,714
This is what happens if you panic.
You can die down there.

540
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:56,469
This is only a pool. In the Pacific,
you won't have a frogman to save your ass.

541
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:08,606
Totally unsatisfactory, Perryman.
Get in the back of the line. Do it again.

542
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:11,776
You only got two more chances to make it,
or you're out.

543
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:13,111
All right, next.

544
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,698
Hold it. Change in order.

545
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:21,244
Mayo, since you're hot shot of the week,
you're next.

546
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:24,581
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Seeger. You're behind him.

547
00:51:24,749 --> 00:51:25,957
Yes, sir.

548
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:36,009
You ought to be good at this, Mayo.
Something you can do alone.

549
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,178
Take him up, Joe!

550
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:42,557
You never know in this program
what's going to trip you up.

551
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:48,730
It could be the grade or some flaw in your character
that comes out under stress.

552
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:52,859
Let's go, Joe.

553
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,131
All right. Way to go.

554
00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:17,425
Seeger, you're next.

555
00:52:17,593 --> 00:52:21,262
All right, Seeger, let's go.
Get a move on.

556
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,097
Joe, take her up.

557
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:33,399
- Don't you cry now, sugar breeches.
- Go, Joe.

558
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:52,377
- All right, Seeger!
- All right.

559
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:54,462
Good girl.

560
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:01,094
Oh, gosh, that was great!
Think they'd let us do it again?

561
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:09,644
Not bad, Seeger.
But you still gotta get over that wall.

562
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,439
Next.

563
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:18,152
- Come on, Daniels, let's move it.
- Take it easy now. Just a joyride.

564
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:27,245
Does this thing hit
with the same impact as a plane?

565
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:32,500
This is nothing compared to a plane.
Don't forget to watch the bubbles.

566
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:35,795
All right, Joe, take him up.

567
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:51,561
Daniels, let's have that thumbs up.

568
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:56,232
Come on, Daniels.
Where's the thumbs up?

569
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,568
Go, Joe.

570
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,507
Hold it, take it easy.

571
00:54:37,983 --> 00:54:41,319
- Pull it back up.
- I can't. It's gonna take a couple seconds.

572
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:52,580
All right, let me through.

573
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:09,180
Put him on his belly.

574
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,518
- Take his helmet off! Quick!
- Goddamn.

575
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,273
Somebody get me a corpsman.

576
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:22,402
- Get me a corpsman on the double.
- Yes, sir.

577
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:26,280
Just stand back.

578
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,756
Breathe, man, breathe.

579
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:49,178
All right. All right.

580
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:57,145
Is that corpsman on the way?

581
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:12,076
Somebody check on that corpsman.
He's going to be all right. Take it easy.

582
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,462
Prepare for inspection!

583
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:29,677
Shit. I am not going to make it.

584
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:40,563
Help me out, Sid. You got a spare?

585
00:56:40,731 --> 00:56:45,526
No, man. My spare sucks.
You know where the hardware store is.

586
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:49,322
Zack, I need a buckle, man.

587
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:55,453
- I can't risk it.
- You got plenty of time. He's still with the girls.

588
00:56:55,621 --> 00:56:59,332
- I can't do it.
- I got to see my family.

589
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:01,751
I couldn't take it if he wouldn't let me out.

590
00:57:01,919 --> 00:57:05,296
Wouldn't want you to get
an honor violation, Perryman.

591
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:08,475
Okay.

592
00:57:09,343 --> 00:57:11,260
Okay.

593
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:14,347
Attention on deck!

594
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:32,615
In every class there's always one joker
who thinks he's smarter than me.

595
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:40,873
In this class that happens to be you,
isn't it, Mayonnaise?

596
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:52,301
Perryman, Worley, let us have this room.

597
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,470
On the double.

598
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:57,181
- Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
- Stow it.

599
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:05,064
Mayo, I want you D.O.R.

600
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:11,821
No, sir. You can kick me out of here,
but I ain't quitting.

601
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:22,165
Get into your fatigues, Mayo.

602
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:26,002
By the end of this weekend, you'll quit.

603
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:37,597
- <i>Casey Jones was a son of a bitch</i>
- <i>Casey Jones was a son of a bitch</i>

604
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:43,186
- <i>Drove his train in a 30-foot ditch</i>
- <i>Drove his train in a 30-foot ditch</i>

605
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:47,899
- <i>Came on out with his dick in his hand</i>
- <i>Came on out with his dick in his hand</i>

606
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:52,778
- <i>Said, "Listen, ladies, I'm a hell of a man"</i>
- <i>Said, "Listen, ladies, I'm a hell of a man"</i>

607

- <i>Went to his room and lined up a hundred</i>

608

- <i>Swore up and down he'd fuck every one</i>

609
00:59:03,165 --> 00:59:08,002
- <i>Fucked 98 till his balls turned blue</i>
- <i>Fucked 98 till his balls turned blue</i>

610
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:11,049
<i>Then he backed off, jacked off
and fucked the other two</i>

611
00:59:11,214 --> 00:59:13,716
<i>Then he backed off, jacked off
and fucked the other two</i>

612
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:16,052
Wave goodbye to your buddies, Mayo.

613
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:20,348
I forgot. You don't have any buddies,
only customers.

614
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:25,144
- Are you having fun, Mayonnaise?
- Yes, sir!

615
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,897
- Can't hear you! All right!
- Yes, sir!

616
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:34,528
Ninety-eight, 99.

617
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:38,574
No, get your face all the way down in there.

618
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,329
Hundred.

619
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:48,084
- Are you ready to quit now, Mayo?
- No, sir!

620
00:59:48,794 --> 00:59:51,170
Look over there, Mayo.

621
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,839
Look over there, look at her.

622
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:57,802
She decided to stay
instead of taking liberty this weekend.

623
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:03,391
She may not make it, but she's got more heart
and more character than you'll ever have.

624
01:00:03,684 --> 01:00:05,434
Stop eyeballing me!

625
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:11,732
Life sure has dealt you
some shitty cards, hasn't it?

626
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:14,193
I'm doing all right, sir.

627
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:18,406
- Six.
- Bullshit.

628
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:22,702
I've done some checking.
I've looked through your files.

629
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:26,914
I know about your momma.
Don't you eyeball me again.

630
01:00:27,082 --> 01:00:30,835
I know your father is an alcoholic
and a whore chaser.

631
01:00:31,378 --> 01:00:35,089
That's why you don't mesh.
Because deep down--

632
01:00:35,257 --> 01:00:37,925
Don't you eyeball me, boy!

633
01:00:38,093 --> 01:00:44,724
Deep down inside you know
these other boys and girls are better than you.

634
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:49,270
- Isn't that right?
- No, sir! No, sir!

635
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:58,738
What's the matter, Mayo?
Are you getting tired? I'm not. Move it!

636
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:03,409
This is where the fun starts. Move it!

637
01:01:03,577 --> 01:01:08,372
You've got all day tomorrow
to look forward to. Come on!

638
01:01:15,346 --> 01:01:16,922
Six inches off the ground.

639
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,342
Now give me 6 to 90.

640
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,888
Hey, Mayo...

641
01:01:24,056 --> 01:01:29,060
why don't we quit this charade of yours
over a couple of beers at TJ's?

642
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:32,688
You're about as close
to being officer material as me.

643
01:01:32,856 --> 01:01:35,649
This candidate believes
he would make a good officer.

644
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:41,072
No way. You don't give a shit about anybody.
Every one of your classmates knows it.

645
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:45,493
You think they'd trust you behind the controls
of a plane they'd have to fly in?

646
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:50,998
I picture you as the guy who would zip off
in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.

647
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:54,210
No, sir! I love my country.

648
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:57,546
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo.

649
01:01:59,508 --> 01:02:05,596
Talk to me. Why would a slick little hustler
like you want to sign up for this abuse?

650
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:09,016
- I want to fly jets, sir.
- My grandmamma wants to fly jets.

651
01:02:09,184 --> 01:02:11,143
I wanted to since I was a kid!

652
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:14,855
We're not talking about flying,
we're talking about character.

653
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:18,150
- I've changed since I've been here.
- The hell you have!

654
01:02:18,318 --> 01:02:20,403
I've changed, sir!

655
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:24,740
You've just polished up your act,
just shined it up.

656
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:27,660
Now tell me what I want to hear.

657
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:30,788
- I want your D.O.R.
- No, sir.

658
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:35,126
- I ain't gonna quit.
- Spell it! D-O-R!

659
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:39,547
Then you and your daddy can get drunk
and go whore chasing.

660
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,341
- No, sir! I ain't going to quit!
- D.O.R.

661
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:45,136
Then you can forget it! You're out!

662
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:50,099
Don't you do it! Don't you....

663
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:54,979
I got nowhere else to go!

664
01:02:55,147 --> 01:02:58,315
I got nowhere else to....

665
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,868
I got nothing else.

666
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:12,621
I got nothing else.

667
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:17,710
All right, Mayo. On your feet.

668
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,611
Come on, Mayo.
Let's get back to the barracks.

669
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:45,529
Hey, Foley!

670
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:48,908
Zack, don't give up!
You got that queer on the run!

671
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:54,205
- Kiss this, Foley!
- Hang in there, Zack!

672
01:03:54,414 --> 01:03:57,625
- Friends of yours, Mayo?
- Don't give up the ship, Mayo!

673
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:59,043
Yes, sir.

674
01:03:59,211 --> 01:04:04,340
- We're with you, Zack!
- Don't quit, Zack, you can make it!

675
01:04:04,508 --> 01:04:09,011
All right, you've got some urinals to clean.
Move out.

676
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:13,974
Foley's a queer!
He got his balls shot off in the war!

677
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:33,786
So you're still here, Mayo.

678
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:52,179
- Sid?
- Yeah.

679
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:55,599
Thanks.

680
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,735
Sid.

681
01:05:08,113 --> 01:05:10,114
Take a look at that.

682
01:05:13,785 --> 01:05:15,578
That son of a bitch.

683
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:09,274
- Do you want me to get a towel?
- I'll get one if you want.

684
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:12,778
- No, I don't want you to move.
- I don't want to move.

685
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:17,241
Somebody's gotta move sometime.

686
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:19,243
Eventually.

687
01:07:20,245 --> 01:07:25,624
"They found them there weeks later,
shriveled from lack of food and water."

688
01:07:34,676 --> 01:07:35,903
Bye, Zachary.

689
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:50,649
I laughed all week thinking
about you guys on that boat.

690
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:55,195
We were so drunk.

691
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:10,085
That looks pretty sharp. Pretty sharp.

692
01:08:13,173 --> 01:08:16,884
I'd love to be one of those girls
in the flight program.

693
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,928
I think it'd be a gas to fly.

694
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:22,890
What's stopping you?

695
01:08:25,477 --> 01:08:29,480
You know, all those magazines
and what they say, it's just....

696
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:32,524
It's not so easy for a girl.

697
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:36,779
That's no excuse for not going out
and getting what you want.

698
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:40,115
Just go get it.

699
01:08:42,452 --> 01:08:47,247
And who says I'm not going after
what I want?

700
01:08:47,415 --> 01:08:49,458
Not me.

701
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:58,133
My mom's 39 years old.
She still works over at that factory.

702
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:03,347
Every time I look at her,
I know exactly what I don't want.

703
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:11,188
My old lady....

704
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:15,776
took a bottle of pills one day
when I was at school.

705
01:09:15,944 --> 01:09:17,945
Oh, God.

706
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:26,203
The thing that got me about it....

707
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:32,709
she didn't leave a note. She didn't....

708
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:38,257
Nothing. She just checked out.

709
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:45,097
I always hated her for that.

710
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:49,101
Oh, God.

711
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:52,020
That must really hurt.

712
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,773
Hurt? No.

713
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:58,110
No. You're all alone in the world.

714
01:09:59,237 --> 01:10:04,283
Once you've got that down,
nothing hurts anymore.

715
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:12,207
I bet most people would buy that line
when you feed it to them, huh?

716
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:40,652
Hey, are you really serious
about having him over?

717
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,906
I don't know.
I haven't made up my mind yet.

718
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:48,410
Paula, how far would you go to get Zack?

719
01:10:48,578 --> 01:10:52,414
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

720
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:55,042
Would you let yourself get pregnant?

721
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:58,837
No way, Lynette. Come on, would you?

722
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:04,051
Well, I never used to think
I'd do something like that.

723
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:06,428
I just don't know anymore.

724
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:10,641
Nine weeks just ain't long enough
to get a guy to fall in love with you.

725
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:14,978
That doesn't justify trying to trap him
or getting pregnant.

726
01:11:15,146 --> 01:11:18,523
I can't believe you had that thought.
It's real backward.

727
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,276
It ain't any more backward if you ask me.

728
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:26,323
The way these hot-shot assholes use us
until they've had enough...

729
01:11:26,491 --> 01:11:28,659
and then ditch us like trash.

730
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:32,412
Don't you ever feel used, Paula?
Don't you ever feel like:

731
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:37,459
"If this is all I get for my troubles,
then the son of a bitch ought to be paying for it?"

732
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:40,754
No, I never feel like that.

733
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:45,300
Well, I do.

734
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:06,947
- Thanks again for the flowers, Zack.
- Oh, it was my pleasure, ma'am.

735
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:09,825
Those are the most beautiful things
I ever saw.

736
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:15,831
Wipe that stuff off your mouth.

737
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:18,583
Zack.

738
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:24,631
This is great.

739
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,136
Sir?

740
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:36,893
How many more weeks till graduation?

741
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:40,564
Oh, I have three more. Three more weeks.

742
01:12:40,732 --> 01:12:45,736
- Those are the roughest ones of all.
- That's what they tell me.

743
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:58,540
Sir, excuse me,
but why do you keep staring at my food?

744
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:01,418
Or are you staring at me?

745
01:13:01,586 --> 01:13:05,589
- Staring at you.
- He doesn't mean anything by it.

746
01:13:05,757 --> 01:13:08,425
Do you, Joe?

747
01:13:09,761 --> 01:13:12,387
No, I don't mean anything by it.

748
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,564
Would you like more chicken, Zack?

749
01:13:23,316 --> 01:13:28,445
No, thanks. In fact, I've had it.
I can't eat another bite.

750
01:13:28,613 --> 01:13:30,906
- This was great.
- I'm stuffed too.

751
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:35,535
This is the best meal I've had
in a long time, ma'am. Thank you.

752
01:13:35,703 --> 01:13:38,121
Why don't we go, Zack?
Thank you, Mom.

753
01:13:38,289 --> 01:13:41,416
- Thank you, Zack.
- Thanks again, ma'am.

754
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:44,961
Go on and eat.

755
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:50,967
Mama, mama.

756
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:53,595
Sorry. I'm so embarrassed, Zack.

757
01:13:53,763 --> 01:13:56,890
I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.

758
01:13:57,058 --> 01:14:01,186
That's okay. A great free meal.
A nice relaxing dinner.

759
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:07,901
These people are so uptight.
I feel sorry for you.

760
01:14:08,069 --> 01:14:12,447
Don't feel sorry for me, I'm used to it.
It's hereditary.

761
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:18,453
So anyway, after this you go to basic flight,
which is in Pensacola, right?

762
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:20,956
Yeah, Pensacola.

763
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:26,253
Then, uh, we go to Beeville, Texas,
when I get jets.

764
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:33,093
So after that. Don't you think about....
I mean, come on.

765
01:14:33,261 --> 01:14:37,222
What's after that? Family? Kids?

766
01:14:37,390 --> 01:14:39,724
Do you think about all that?

767
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:42,602
No.

768
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:47,023
- Is that what you think about?
- Sometimes.

769
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:52,779
If I could do a better job than them,
I'd love it.

770
01:14:52,947 --> 01:14:57,909
- What would you do different?
- Everything.

771
01:14:58,077 --> 01:15:00,662
First, I'd marry a man I really loved.

772
01:15:02,915 --> 01:15:07,419
So why did your mom marry this guy,
if she didn't love him?

773
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:10,922
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.

774
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:14,718
- Your real father?
- My real father.

775
01:15:14,886 --> 01:15:17,137
I'll show you my real father.

776
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:19,723
Pop.

777
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:30,358
I see your real father
was an officer's candidate like me.

778
01:15:30,526 --> 01:15:34,362
- About 22 years ago.
- Jesus.

779
01:15:35,907 --> 01:15:38,241
No wonder this guy was looking at me funny.

780
01:15:38,409 --> 01:15:40,785
He always looks funny.

781
01:15:52,924 --> 01:15:58,386
- It's about time I got back to the wars.
- Yeah, I know.

782
01:16:03,434 --> 01:16:05,518
Thank your mom for dinner again, okay?

783
01:16:05,686 --> 01:16:08,939
- Great chicken, huh?
- Yeah, I loved the chicken.

784
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:14,236
If you get a chance this week,
give me a call, okay?

785
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:19,199
I'll try. I got survival training this week,
so I can't make any promises.

786
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:21,618
No promises.

787
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:26,748
Zack, I didn't have to show you that picture
if I didn't want to.

788
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:30,335
- I just wanted to tell you that.
- Yeah, I know.

789
01:16:34,966 --> 01:16:36,883
- Be careful on that thing.
- Yeah.

790
01:17:18,592 --> 01:17:22,178
Are you and Paula still seeing
those flight candidates over at the base?

791
01:17:22,346 --> 01:17:24,931
Why? Any reason we wouldn't be?

792
01:17:25,099 --> 01:17:29,894
Three forty in the afternoon and not a word
about what you're doing over the weekend.

793
01:17:30,062 --> 01:17:35,150
Hi, I'd like to speak with Zack Mayo.
He's an A.O.C. candidate.

794
01:17:36,402 --> 01:17:39,446
Could you look around for him?
Tell him it's Paula.

795
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:42,991
Liberty time, boys and girls.

796
01:17:44,285 --> 01:17:46,870
Fall out!

797
01:17:47,038 --> 01:17:49,080
Aye, aye, sir!

798
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:53,460
Where are you going?
Where's my bread?

799
01:17:56,047 --> 01:17:59,382
- Seeger, don't forget TJ's.
- I won't.

800
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:03,178
Hey, Mayo, you've got a phone call.
Somebody named Paula.

801
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:08,183
- Tell her I already split.
- Let's go!

802
01:18:09,552 --> 01:18:10,569
Hey!

803
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:19,402
I see. Okay.

804
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:22,030
There comes a time.

805
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:26,826
Right after survival training
they think they can make it without you.

806
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:32,749
Suddenly, they stop calling.
Suddenly, they own the goddamn world.

807
01:18:34,919 --> 01:18:38,004
They said that he had already left.

808
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:40,632
I don't think that he did.

809
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,259
He hasn't called by now,
he ain't going to.

810
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,678
Bunny, why don't you just shut up?

811
01:18:45,888 --> 01:18:49,099
- You don't know so much.
- Clock me out, Lynette.

812
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:52,268
Paula, what are you doing?

813
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:55,188
May they all crash and burn.

814
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:03,071
- Paula, wait! Where are you going?
- Let me go, Momma.

815
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,907
You're going to the base.
Don't do it.

816
01:19:06,075 --> 01:19:08,952
I love him.
I can't just let him run off.

817
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,747
- How are you going to stop him?
- I'm gonna think of a way.

818
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,624
- No!
- No?

819
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:21,256
Honey, please. I can't let you do this.
Don't go, baby. Please, don't go.

820
01:19:21,424 --> 01:19:27,345
- What are you crying about?
- Because I know what you're feeling.

821
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:31,224
- What am I feeling?
- Don't do it. Let him go.

822
01:19:31,392 --> 01:19:35,103
- Don't trick him or try to trap him.
- I wouldn't do that!

823
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:37,397
- Yes.
- I would never trap him.

824
01:19:37,565 --> 01:19:43,194
If you go there tonight and find him,
you'll say anything, baby. You will.

825
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:45,989
And God help you after that.

826
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:57,625
Momma, you're right.

827
01:20:00,087 --> 01:20:05,800
Daddy, Zack's only two-tenths of a second
off the all-time obstacle course record.

828
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,927
He's gonna break it before he leaves.

829
01:20:08,095 --> 01:20:10,930
You are lucky you weren't in the program
when I was.

830
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:14,350
You couldn't just quit
the way you can now.

831
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:17,770
When I went through it,
when my oldest boy went through it...

832
01:20:17,938 --> 01:20:21,149
if you bilged out,
you were put into the fleet as a swabby.

833
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:27,739
- That's interesting, sir.
- Sid, you haven't written Susan in three weeks.

834
01:20:29,241 --> 01:20:34,829
We haven't had time to write anybody.
I have written y'all but once.

835
01:20:34,997 --> 01:20:36,124
It's incredible.

836
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:41,169
- Right?
- Oh, yeah.

837
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:52,764
- Who is this Susan, anyway?
- It's my girl back home.

838
01:20:52,932 --> 01:20:55,767
I'm marrying her as soon
as I get out of here.

839
01:20:57,728 --> 01:21:01,189
She was Tommy's girl. They were supposed
to get married before he got killed.

840
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:10,198
I don't know why I didn't tell you.
I guess I didn't want you to think I was a shit.

841
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:13,868
I ain't your parents, you know.

842
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:19,916
- Do you love this girl?
- The greatest chick you want to know.

843
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:25,296
She loves kids.
Works with handicapped kids every afternoon.

844
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,675
That ain't what I'm talking about.

845
01:21:28,842 --> 01:21:33,388
- I asked you if you loved her.
- Everybody loves her.

846
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:38,059
- I'm not gonna make that reunion tonight.
- Why not?

847
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:41,396
I'm meeting Lynette over at the Tides.

848
01:21:42,815 --> 01:21:46,859
Best head in 52 states, man.
What can I do?

849
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:50,613
No, no, no.
You should have done what I did.

850
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:56,035
Break it off clean. Have it done with.
Over. That's the best.

851
01:21:58,372 --> 01:22:03,501
She was pretty torn up you didn't call,
but I'm not supposed to tell you that.

852
01:22:10,801 --> 01:22:13,303
Women, women, women.

853
01:22:15,514 --> 01:22:21,519
They always say, "We'll have a good time,
lots of laughs, no problems."

854
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:25,356
Doesn't work that way, does it?

855
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:33,114
Look out, TJ's. Here I come.

856
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,950
See you later, man.

857
01:22:49,548 --> 01:22:52,175
- To survival.
- To survival.

858
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:54,011
In spite of fear.

859
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:58,473
In spite of Foley.

860
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:01,893
Is that your deb over there, Mayo?

861
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:17,784
She's pulling rank on you.
That's a flight instructor.

862
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,641
I'll be back in a minute.

863
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:02,578
What are you doing here?

864
01:24:02,746 --> 01:24:09,043
I thought it was time to see legendary TJ's
once before I left here.

865
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:16,801
- You come here a lot?
- I come here once in a while.

866
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:24,267
I'm sorry I didn't call you this weekend.
This whole week has been unbelievable.

867
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:28,229
It's okay. How did survival training go?

868
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:30,449
- I survived.
- You survived, obviously.

869
01:24:33,026 --> 01:24:38,156
- How was your week?
- It was good.

870
01:24:38,323 --> 01:24:41,993
- I'm gonna get a raise next month.
- That's great.

871
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,874
You guys are graduating
in a couple of weeks?

872
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:52,628
Yeah, I'm starting to believe
I'm actually going to make it.

873
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:57,884
You'll make it. Remember, I told you.
You saw it, and it happened.

874
01:24:58,051 --> 01:25:00,636
Yeah, you told me.

875
01:25:03,182 --> 01:25:06,518
I gotta go. I have a date. So....

876
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:10,688
Look, there's something I want to....

877
01:25:11,774 --> 01:25:14,025
What?

878
01:25:14,193 --> 01:25:18,404
I.... I wanted to thank you.

879
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:23,409
I don't think I would have made it
through this crazy thing...

880
01:25:23,577 --> 01:25:28,873
- if I didn't have something to look forward to.
- Don't thank me. I had a good time.

881
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:33,711
And good luck in Pensacola
with your flight training...

882
01:25:33,879 --> 01:25:36,339
and get jets, huh?

883
01:25:41,053 --> 01:25:43,471
I'll see you, Zack.

884
01:25:52,231 --> 01:25:54,774
Jay, give me another one.

885
01:25:58,529 --> 01:26:02,365
In fact, leave the bottle.
Give me the bottle and four shooters.

886
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:08,788
Come here, baby doll. Come here.

887
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,086
Come over here.

888
01:26:16,255 --> 01:26:19,632
Sit down here for a second.
I gotta tell you something.

889
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:29,016
I just had to have one more taste.

890
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:33,271
Does that stuff come in anything
besides strawberry?

891
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:36,649
How about if I bring some coconut next time?

892
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:44,949
Sid, I really gotta go.

893
01:26:51,498 --> 01:26:53,499
Shouldn't you have got your period by now?

894
01:26:54,877 --> 01:26:57,837
I'm a little late, that's all.

895
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:03,718
- How late are you?
- Why? What's the difference?

896
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:09,307
If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it's not,
it'd be my responsibility.

897
01:27:11,435 --> 01:27:15,229
- Exactly how late are you?
- What do you care?

898
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:19,901
Suppose I was to get pregnant?
I mean, just suppose it.

899
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:23,195
I'd never try to make you do something
you didn't want to do.

900
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:25,990
Oh, I know.

901
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:30,244
But, uh, that's not the only issue.
There's more to it than that.

902
01:27:30,412 --> 01:27:33,581
What other issue is there, Sid?

903
01:27:36,752 --> 01:27:38,294
Come here.

904
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:42,340
My responsibilities as a father,
for one thing.

905
01:27:43,133 --> 01:27:47,136
If I've got you pregnant,
I want to do the right thing by you.

906
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:49,931
I wanna pay for the abortion.

907
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:56,479
I wanna be with you through the whole thing,
we'd be going through it together.

908
01:27:58,357 --> 01:28:00,816
So how late are you?

909
01:28:03,236 --> 01:28:06,364
Let's just wait and see what happens, okay?

910
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:11,369
See you later.

911
01:28:12,454 --> 01:28:14,372
I'll call you.

912
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:16,207
Fuck.

913
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:18,960
- Go.
- Last chance for the record! Go!

914
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:22,755
- Go for the record, Mayo!
- This is it, Mayonnaise. Go.

915
01:28:36,353 --> 01:28:39,814
Go for it, man. Go get it.
You got it!

916
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:53,577
- Go, Mayo, push it!
- Get there. Put your name on that wall!

917
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,672
Come on, Mike, let's catch that animal!

918
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:15,641
Let's do this together, Seeger.

919
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:26,527
- Come on.
- Forget it. Go for the record.

920
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:31,532
Come on, hurry up!

921
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:36,328
- Go, go, go!
- Come on, you've got it!

922
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:42,960
- Get up.
- Forget it.

923
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:47,006
You want jets? Then get up!
You're going over that wall.

924
01:29:47,174 --> 01:29:51,260
Start right here. Three steps.
Right, left, right.

925
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:54,221
Hand over hand. Walk the wall.

926
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:57,016
Come on, Seeger. Let's go.

927
01:29:57,184 --> 01:30:01,687
Left, right and pull.
Walk that wall, Seeger!

928
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:03,689
Walk the wall! Hand over hand!

929
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:06,735
Walk it, walk it! Walk the wall!

930
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:11,280
Seeger! Walk! Seeger!

931
01:30:11,448 --> 01:30:14,326
Don't you let go! You walk that wall!

932
01:30:15,869 --> 01:30:20,206
Pull, Candidate Seeger.
Pull, pull! You've got it. Pull over!

933
01:30:20,457 --> 01:30:21,474
Pull over!

934
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:24,376
Pull yourself over!

935
01:30:24,544 --> 01:30:26,462
All right!

936
01:30:46,566 --> 01:30:48,400
Where's Sid?

937
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:56,659
<i>What makes you think she's not lying?</i>

938
01:30:57,119 --> 01:31:00,704
She went to the doctor, she had the test,
she's pregnant.

939
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:05,292
- Okay, so get an abortion.
- I'd love to, believe me.

940
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:08,712
She won't even talk about it.
She's Catholic.

941
01:31:09,548 --> 01:31:13,050
Sid, you're not going to marry this girl.

942
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:17,138
She says it's up to me, but if I don't,
she'll go off and have the baby.

943
01:31:17,305 --> 01:31:20,099
- So what? Women do it all the time.
- So what?

944
01:31:20,267 --> 01:31:24,395
I can't let her have a kid by herself.
It's my kid too.

945
01:31:24,563 --> 01:31:26,272
Are you sure?

946
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:29,817
It's mine.

947
01:31:36,867 --> 01:31:39,243
I'm sorry, all right?

948
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:42,288
Listen, what if Foley was right?

949
01:31:42,455 --> 01:31:45,916
She got herself knocked up to trap you,
is it still your responsibility?

950
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:51,839
That's not the point. No matter how it happened,
there'd be a child that is mine.

951
01:31:52,007 --> 01:31:54,592
I wouldn't know its name or nothing.

952
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:58,387
Jesus Christ, is everything your responsibility?

953
01:32:01,558 --> 01:32:06,061
Sit. Adjust. Pray. Attack.

954
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:09,565
It's just like your brother getting killed.

955
01:32:09,733 --> 01:32:14,778
It's the same thing as your brother.
Him getting killed instead of you.

956
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:17,239
Isn't that the reason
you promised to marry Susan?

957
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:21,410
Isn't the reason to do everything
after some bullshit code of ethics?

958
01:32:21,578 --> 01:32:26,790
It may be bullshit to you, buddy,
but I wasn't raised that way.

959
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:29,418
We got a responsibility
to the people in our lives.

960
01:32:29,586 --> 01:32:32,379
It's the only thing that separates us
from the animals.

961
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:38,427
I'm not like you. I can't shit all over people
and just sleep like a baby.

962
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:42,014
You got responsibility to yourself first.
If you can't handle that...

963
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:44,850
you got bigger problems
than making some girl pregnant!

964
01:32:45,602 --> 01:32:48,562
Gentlemen, relax.

965
01:33:05,538 --> 01:33:08,249
<i>Without an oxygen mask at 30,000 feet...</i>

966
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:10,960
<i>your insides will feel
like this rubber glove.</i>

967
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:16,715
<i>Your co-ordination will deteriorate,
and even childlike exercises will seem impossible.</i>

968
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:21,470
<i>Look for the warning signs:
giddiness, shortness of breath, claustrophobia.</i>

969
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:23,097
<i>They can hit you at any moment.</i>

970
01:33:23,265 --> 01:33:26,767
<i>At the instant you feel yourself losing control,
go back on oxygen.</i>

971
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:29,144
<i>That's the whole purpose of this drill.</i>

972
01:33:29,312 --> 01:33:32,606
- <i>Does everyone understand the exercises?</i>
- Aye, aye.

973
01:33:32,816 --> 01:33:37,194
<i>Okay, everybody set?
Let's see a thumbs up, please.</i>

974
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:40,281
Very good.
Everybody remove your mask, please.

975
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:43,909
<i>All right. You can begin the exercises now.</i>

976
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:50,624
Queen of diamonds.

977
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:55,587
Nine of diamonds.

978
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:59,758
<i>If you have any problems,
put your mask on.</i>

979
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:03,637
<i>Or if you have trouble doing that,
raise your hand and the corpsman will assist.</i>

980
01:34:03,805 --> 01:34:04,931
Five of clubs.

981
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:09,393
<i>How are you doing, Mayo and Seeger?
Having trouble?</i>

982
01:34:10,562 --> 01:34:14,398
<i>Concentrate. Try to make your palms meet.</i>

983
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:19,278
Ace of spades.

984
01:34:20,864 --> 01:34:23,615
<i>How are you doing, Worley?</i>

985
01:34:24,993 --> 01:34:28,037
<i>Worley, are you all right?</i>

986
01:34:30,457 --> 01:34:33,959
- <i>Worley, can you hear me?</i>
- Ace of spades.

987
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:37,629
<i>Worley, put your mask back on.</i>

988
01:34:37,797 --> 01:34:40,549
- Sid, you okay?
- Sid, are you all right?

989
01:34:40,717 --> 01:34:43,552
- I got to get out of here.
- Worley, sit down!

990
01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:46,513
Corpsman, we got a problem.

991
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:50,476
- I've got to get out of here!
- <i>Corpsman, get that mask on.</i>

992
01:34:50,685 --> 01:34:56,482
It's all right, breathe.
Get out of here! It's all right. Breathe.

993
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:58,859
Mayo, they're watching.

994
01:34:59,069 --> 01:35:01,278
<i>One minute.
We gotta stabilize the pressure.</i>

995
01:35:01,488 --> 01:35:06,825
- <i>Put your masks on.</i>
- Come on, man, everybody's watching.

996
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:11,246
Breathe. Breathe.

997
01:35:11,414 --> 01:35:13,415
<i>Stay where you are.
Leave your masks on.</i>

998
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:15,084
He's got it now. He's got it.

999
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:19,296
It's okay. No problem. He's okay.

1000
01:35:20,382 --> 01:35:22,174
Colors!

1001
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:41,819
Secure the halyard.

1002
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:46,323
Charlie, take care of that.

1003
01:35:48,952 --> 01:35:51,036
What's going on?

1004
01:35:52,372 --> 01:35:57,292
You didn't kick him out? Didn't he tell you
what he's been going through?

1005
01:35:57,460 --> 01:36:00,295
It doesn't matter.
That's the purpose of this zoo.

1006
01:36:00,463 --> 01:36:04,800
What does matter
is that he freaked out at 25,000 feet.

1007
01:36:04,968 --> 01:36:07,511
That can't happen ever.

1008
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:10,639
He's got a girl, she's pregnant,
she's putting him through hell.

1009
01:36:10,807 --> 01:36:14,977
- That don't matter.
- Don't matter? You got two weeks left!

1010
01:36:15,145 --> 01:36:20,441
- It could still happen to you, Mayonnaise.
- He ain't bullshitting you.

1011
01:36:20,608 --> 01:36:24,778
- I'm talking to you, motherfucker!
- Don't fuck it up for you, man.

1012
01:36:24,988 --> 01:36:27,489
What did you call me?

1013
01:36:34,622 --> 01:36:39,001
I thought the D.I. was supposed to help.
What kind of a human being are you?

1014
01:36:39,169 --> 01:36:42,004
Lock it up, or you're gonna be
going home with him.

1015
01:36:42,172 --> 01:36:45,215
Zack, go back to the barracks, please.

1016
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:50,679
I don't get this.
He's the best candidate in the class!

1017
01:36:51,139 --> 01:36:56,185
He's the best student, the best leader,
the best friend to everybody.

1018
01:36:56,394 --> 01:37:00,772
- Can't you bend your rules for once?
- He didn't ask me to D.O.R.

1019
01:37:00,940 --> 01:37:04,193
- I went to him.
- What are you talking about?

1020
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:10,032
I'm glad it's over. He was right.
I was here for everybody but me.

1021
01:37:12,285 --> 01:37:15,579
I was here for my big brother.

1022
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:22,085
Hey, buddy. Sid, wait a minute. Sid!

1023
01:37:28,551 --> 01:37:30,969
Request permission to carry on....

1024
01:37:31,513 --> 01:37:35,682
- sir!
- Get the fuck out of here.

1025
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:52,908
- Yes, sir. Keep the change.
- Thanks, pal.

1026
01:37:58,122 --> 01:37:59,957
Lynette.

1027
01:38:04,796 --> 01:38:06,713
- Hi, baby.
- Hi, Sid.

1028
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:09,591
- Come out here.
- What are you doing out of uniform?

1029
01:38:09,759 --> 01:38:12,219
Don't worry, just come out here.

1030
01:38:12,387 --> 01:38:17,015
- Wait. I look like a mess.
- All right, if you don't want it.

1031
01:38:18,977 --> 01:38:22,896
All right. What?

1032
01:38:23,106 --> 01:38:26,817
- Well, if you don't want it....
- What?

1033
01:38:32,073 --> 01:38:34,199
Oh, my God.

1034
01:38:35,076 --> 01:38:38,370
Oh, my God. It's beautiful.

1035
01:38:38,580 --> 01:38:42,082
Cost me my whole savings, but I said,
"What the fuck?"

1036
01:38:42,292 --> 01:38:43,460
Oh, Sid!

1037
01:38:45,628 --> 01:38:51,258
- So does this mean....?
- Yes, ma'am! That's what it means.

1038
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:56,096
- Oh, Sid!
- Let's get a justice of the peace and do it now.

1039
01:38:56,306 --> 01:39:00,434
I can't wait to tell Paula.
I wonder where we're gonna get stationed first.

1040
01:39:00,602 --> 01:39:03,520
I hope we go to Hawaii.
I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.

1041
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:07,232
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere.
I D.O.R.'ed.

1042
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:11,570
- You've what?
- I D.O.R.'ed.

1043
01:39:11,738 --> 01:39:14,031
Hell, I was never cut out to be a pilot.

1044
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:17,868
I was faking it. I've been faking
everything in my life up to now.

1045
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:24,583
But what'll we do?
Where would we go?

1046
01:39:25,460 --> 01:39:27,836
Oklahoma.

1047
01:39:28,004 --> 01:39:33,216
I'm gonna get my old job back at J.C. Penney's.
In two years, I'll be floor manager.

1048
01:39:34,802 --> 01:39:38,555
You're gonna love Oklahoma.
And you and Mom are gonna get along great.

1049
01:39:38,765 --> 01:39:41,975
Money might be tight at first,
so we might have to live at home.

1050
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:47,522
- It's gonna work out.
- Sid, there's no baby.

1051
01:39:49,233 --> 01:39:50,984
What?

1052
01:39:56,449 --> 01:39:59,284
I'm not pregnant.

1053
01:40:01,162 --> 01:40:06,416
I got my period this morning.
There's no baby, Sid.

1054
01:40:11,381 --> 01:40:13,674
I'll be goddamned.

1055
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:35,487
What do you say we get married anyway?

1056
01:40:35,655 --> 01:40:37,948
I love you.

1057
01:40:38,616 --> 01:40:42,536
I don't think I knew that till just now,
just this second.

1058
01:40:44,122 --> 01:40:48,542
I have never been happier
than I have the last seven weeks.

1059
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:50,919
I never felt so relaxed.

1060
01:40:51,129 --> 01:40:55,465
I've never felt so loved
for who I really am.

1061
01:41:06,352 --> 01:41:12,315
Lynette, marry me.
Make me the happiest man in the whole world.

1062
01:41:23,453 --> 01:41:27,789
I'm sorry, Sid, but I don't want to marry you.

1063
01:41:31,419 --> 01:41:34,004
I really like you...

1064
01:41:34,297 --> 01:41:39,050
and we've had some really great times,
but I thought you understood.

1065
01:41:40,136 --> 01:41:45,307
I want to marry a pilot.
I want to live my life overseas.

1066
01:41:46,058 --> 01:41:48,894
The wife of an aviator.

1067
01:41:55,651 --> 01:41:59,321
Damn you. Goddamn you!

1068
01:42:00,156 --> 01:42:05,952
Nobody D.O.R.'s after 11 weeks. Nobody!

1069
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:24,596
Hey, ma'am. Have you seen Paula around?

1070
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:29,142
- Paula!
- Paula!

1071
01:42:29,977 --> 01:42:34,356
I'm looking for Sid. He D.O.R.'ed and split.
Nobody's seen him since.

1072
01:42:35,191 --> 01:42:37,901
I don't know where to look.

1073
01:42:46,118 --> 01:42:48,286
Lynette's.

1074
01:43:03,636 --> 01:43:06,471
- Same room?
- Yes, sir.

1075
01:43:07,807 --> 01:43:12,978
- Number 3.
- Yeah, that's the one.

1076
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:16,648
- What do you think of this?
- That's nice.

1077
01:43:18,109 --> 01:43:20,735
Watch this. I think you'll like it.

1078
01:43:44,302 --> 01:43:46,261
Damn it!

1079
01:43:50,975 --> 01:43:52,809
Oh, shit.

1080
01:44:08,576 --> 01:44:10,368
Lynette.

1081
01:44:11,662 --> 01:44:15,373
- Has Sid been here?
- Already come and gone.

1082
01:44:15,541 --> 01:44:19,252
- What happened?
- Can you believe it?

1083
01:44:19,420 --> 01:44:23,340
He D.O.R.'ed in the 12th week.

1084
01:44:23,507 --> 01:44:25,759
How can you win?

1085
01:44:30,306 --> 01:44:32,140
Lynette....

1086
01:44:33,643 --> 01:44:36,019
what did you tell him about the baby?

1087
01:44:37,438 --> 01:44:41,858
That there isn't one. As of today.

1088
01:44:43,027 --> 01:44:45,695
I got my period this morning.

1089
01:44:51,910 --> 01:44:57,123
I couldn't believe it.
He still wanted to marry me.

1090
01:44:57,291 --> 01:45:01,252
- And what did you say?
- I said no, of course.

1091
01:45:01,420 --> 01:45:07,175
I don't want no Okie from Muskogee.
I can get that right here.

1092
01:45:07,385 --> 01:45:09,552
You little bitch.

1093
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:13,682
Who the hell do you think you are,
playing with people like that?

1094
01:45:13,891 --> 01:45:17,519
He loves you. You just shit on him.

1095
01:45:19,188 --> 01:45:21,940
You made up this whole thing.
There wasn't any baby.

1096
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:28,154
Of course there was a baby.
I'd never lie about something like that.

1097
01:45:29,699 --> 01:45:32,492
Would I, Paula?

1098
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:41,209
You little cunt.

1099
01:45:46,007 --> 01:45:48,550
God help you.

1100
01:45:48,718 --> 01:45:52,679
- You're no different than I am.
- Oh, yes, I am.

1101
01:45:52,847 --> 01:45:54,931
Oh, no, you're not.

1102
01:46:14,452 --> 01:46:17,871
- Let me see if he's here, okay?
- All right.

1103
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:26,963
Hey, Mack, have you seen Sid Worley around here?

1104
01:46:27,131 --> 01:46:29,257
Yeah, he's here.

1105
01:46:43,314 --> 01:46:45,237
Sid.

1106
01:46:47,735 --> 01:46:49,228
Sid.

1107
01:46:50,321 --> 01:46:52,322
The guy said he just got here.

1108
01:46:55,159 --> 01:46:57,118
Sid.

1109
01:47:02,124 --> 01:47:03,374
Sid?

1110
01:47:05,836 --> 01:47:07,545
Hey, man.

1111
01:47:13,803 --> 01:47:16,012
Sid, are you okay?

1112
01:47:19,475 --> 01:47:21,017
Sid.

1113
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:29,109
- Shit!
- What?

1114
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:32,278
Oh, God.

1115
01:47:37,827 --> 01:47:40,203
Call an ambulance.

1116
01:47:41,789 --> 01:47:43,498
Oh, Sid.

1117
01:47:47,336 --> 01:47:49,254
Oh, my God.

1118
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:56,344
Call an ambulance.

1119
01:48:00,349 --> 01:48:02,267
You dumb fucking Okie.

1120
01:48:02,476 --> 01:48:05,478
I was your friend.

1121
01:48:07,606 --> 01:48:09,693
Why didn't you come
and talk to me about it?

1122
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:15,864
You didn't even try.

1123
01:48:19,451 --> 01:48:22,704
You didn't even say goodbye to me.

1124
01:49:03,871 --> 01:49:08,458
I spoke to the chaplain at the base.
He said he'd call Sid's parents.

1125
01:49:08,626 --> 01:49:14,130
Why can't I learn? Just like her,
all over again. Just like her.

1126
01:49:14,298 --> 01:49:18,927
Zack don't do this to yourself.
You didn't kill your mother.

1127
01:49:19,094 --> 01:49:23,181
You didn't kill Sid.
They killed themselves. Yeah.

1128
01:49:24,850 --> 01:49:27,977
- There's nothing you could've done.
- I gotta get out of here.

1129
01:49:28,145 --> 01:49:31,481
You want some money to get a cab?
Something. I don't....

1130
01:49:31,649 --> 01:49:35,026
- I don't deserve that!
- Okay. All right.

1131
01:49:35,194 --> 01:49:37,820
You're not the only one that's feeling awful.

1132
01:49:37,988 --> 01:49:40,198
Maybe I had something to do
with what happened.

1133
01:49:40,366 --> 01:49:42,867
I knew what Lynette was doing,
I could have said something.

1134
01:49:43,077 --> 01:49:47,330
Look, you've got no problems, all right?

1135
01:49:47,498 --> 01:49:51,334
Another class will be coming soon,
you and Lynette, right back into business.

1136
01:49:51,502 --> 01:49:57,674
That's not fair. I never lied to you.
I never did what Lynette's doing.

1137
01:49:57,841 --> 01:50:00,551
- I'm not Lynette.
- No.

1138
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:05,139
I love you.
I've loved you since I met you.

1139
01:50:05,307 --> 01:50:08,184
Don't you understand?

1140
01:50:09,353 --> 01:50:15,191
No! I don't want you to love me.
I don't want anyone to love me. I just want out!

1141
01:50:20,614 --> 01:50:24,784
- <i>I don't know but it's been said</i>
- <i>I don't know but it's been said</i>

1142
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:29,372
- <i>Air Force wings are made of lead</i>
- <i>Air Force wings are made of lead</i>

1143
01:50:29,540 --> 01:50:31,541
Left, right, left, right.

1144
01:50:31,709 --> 01:50:34,168
Column, right turn!

1145
01:50:34,336 --> 01:50:38,506
- <i>I don't know but I've been told</i>
- <i>I don't know but I've been told</i>

1146
01:50:38,674 --> 01:50:42,844
- <i>Navy wings are made of gold</i>
- <i>Navy wings are made of gold</i>

1147
01:50:43,012 --> 01:50:45,972
Platoon, halt!

1148
01:50:46,598 --> 01:50:52,145
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission
to see you in private, sir.

1149
01:50:52,313 --> 01:50:57,358
Mayo, the whole class knows
about Candidate Worley. We're sorry.

1150
01:50:57,526 --> 01:50:59,694
I bet you are.

1151
01:51:00,195 --> 01:51:03,656
- I want to see you in private, sir.
- Not now, I'm busy.

1152
01:51:03,866 --> 01:51:05,992
- Now.
- Forward, march!

1153
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:11,706
- Sir, I request permission--
- Left, right, left, right.

1154
01:51:11,874 --> 01:51:15,960
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission
to see you in private, sir!

1155
01:51:16,128 --> 01:51:19,922
Not now, I'm busy.
So are you, now get cleaned up.

1156
01:51:21,342 --> 01:51:25,386
I don't need your shit.
I came back to quit! D.O.R.!

1157
01:51:25,554 --> 01:51:27,930
Platoon, halt!

1158
01:51:28,098 --> 01:51:30,933
I don't need you, I don't need the Navy.

1159
01:51:31,977 --> 01:51:33,311
I don't need anybody.

1160
01:51:33,479 --> 01:51:36,272
Okay, Mayo. I see what you want.

1161
01:51:37,316 --> 01:51:42,236
You said you wanted to meet me in private.
You got it.

1162
01:51:42,404 --> 01:51:45,406
The blimp hangar, now! Move it!

1163
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:50,661
- You move it.
- We ain't going there to talk, boy.

1164
01:51:50,829 --> 01:51:52,705
Move!

1165
01:51:54,375 --> 01:51:59,462
Fall out. Fall out!
This is between me and him.

1166
01:52:40,045 --> 01:52:41,671
All right, Mayo.

1167
01:52:44,466 --> 01:52:46,384
Let's see what you got.

1168
01:52:47,845 --> 01:52:50,471
- What's going on?
- Quiet.

1169
01:52:55,602 --> 01:52:57,813
I see you've had some training,
Mayonnaise.

1170
01:53:02,526 --> 01:53:05,862
- Come on, Foley.
- Lookie, lookie, here.

1171
01:53:34,183 --> 01:53:36,893
Your blood is as red as mine,
isn't it, Mayo?

1172
01:53:50,365 --> 01:53:53,242
Come on. Get up!

1173
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:45,545
You can quit now, Mayo, if you want to.
It's up to you.

1174
01:55:17,744 --> 01:55:20,621
Sir, the officers are present.

1175
01:55:20,789 --> 01:55:24,292
Will the guests please rise?

1176
01:55:25,043 --> 01:55:29,922
Class 15-81, raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

1177
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:33,801
- I do solemnly swear--

against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

01:55:45,647 --> 01:55:48,524
against all enemies foreign and domestic.

01:56:07,586 --> 01:56:10,338

1189
01:56:10,505 --> 01:56:13,883
the duties of the office
on which I am about to enter--

1191
01:56:17,220 --> 01:56:19,847

- so help me God.

1192
01:56:20,641 --> 01:56:22,975
Please, be seated.

1193
01:56:24,936 --> 01:56:28,606
- Gunnery Sergeant Foley.
- Sir.

1194
01:56:32,569 --> 01:56:34,403
Well done, sergeant.

1195
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,490
Thank you, sir.

1196
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:54,215
Class 1581.

1197
01:56:55,008 --> 01:56:58,886
- Fall out!
- Aye, aye, sir!

1198
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:03,307
Foley's Fire Eaters finally finished!

1199
01:57:16,279 --> 01:57:18,489
Hey, what'd you think of that?

1200
01:57:20,075 --> 01:57:21,158
What'd you think?

1201
01:57:23,954 --> 01:57:28,666
- I want you to meet my family.
- No, I want to get my first salute.

1202
01:57:39,136 --> 01:57:42,263
Congratulations, Ensign Chadwick.

1203
01:57:49,271 --> 01:57:52,857
- Congratulations, Ensign Seeger.
- Thank you, sir.

1204
01:57:53,066 --> 01:57:55,317
Gunnery Sergeant, Ensign Seeger....

1205
01:57:56,987 --> 01:57:58,612
sir.

1206
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:13,210
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo.

1207
01:58:16,631 --> 01:58:20,634
- I won't ever forget you, sergeant.
- I know.

1208
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:24,221
I wouldn't have made this
if it weren't for you.

1209
01:58:25,390 --> 01:58:27,391
Get the hell out of here.

1210
01:58:28,935 --> 01:58:30,728
Thank you, sergeant.

1211
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:43,199
Congratulations, Ensign Della Serra.

1212
01:58:43,867 --> 01:58:46,118
Thank you, sergeant.

1213
01:58:59,966 --> 01:59:04,720
Every time I say "understand,"
I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir."

1214
01:59:04,888 --> 01:59:06,472
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

1215
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:08,516
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

1216
01:59:08,683 --> 01:59:12,603
I don't believe what I'm seeing.
Where you been all your lives?

1217
01:59:12,771 --> 01:59:16,774
Listening to punk rock music
and bad-mouthing your country, I bet.

1218
01:59:17,651 --> 01:59:20,486
- Where you from, boy?
- Tucson, Arizona, sir!

1219
01:59:20,654 --> 01:59:23,113
- Where?
- Tucson, Arizona, sir!

1220
01:59:23,281 --> 01:59:27,827
Only two things come out of Arizona.
Steers and queers.

1221
01:59:27,994 --> 01:59:31,622
Which one are you?
I don't see horns, so you must be queer.

1222
01:59:31,790 --> 01:59:32,957
- No, sir!
- What?

1223
01:59:33,124 --> 01:59:34,416
No, sir!

1224
01:59:34,584 --> 01:59:38,128
I expect to lose half of you
before I'm finished.

1225
01:59:38,296 --> 01:59:42,591
I'll use every means necessary,
fair and unfair to trip you up.

1226
01:59:57,816 --> 02:00:01,360
Turn it, Bonnie.
No, back the other way.

1227
02:00:01,528 --> 02:00:04,446
Keep going, keep going.

1228
02:01:12,223 --> 02:01:17,478
Way to go, Paula! Way to go!
