1
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:23,605
Will?

2
00:01:23,783 --> 00:01:24,977
What is it, Pa?

3
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,880
Come out here.

4
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,727
Listen. Your ears
are better than mine.

5
00:01:34,894 --> 00:01:37,454
Somebody's coming.

6
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,692
I don't hear nothing.

7
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:42,460
Turn off that whatchama-call-it.

8
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:46,230
-The radio.
-I know what you call it. Turn it off.

9
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,065
First, I heard one of
them cars. Then it stopped.

10
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,804
And now somebody's
coming down the hill.

11
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,572
You hear?

12
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:58,976
Y'all stay right here.
If I call, come a-running.

13
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,253
Pa, that ain't no way to
welcome folks. Maybe it's kin.

14
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,691
Kin don't come in no cars.

15
00:02:09,862 --> 00:02:13,025
See if you can wake
up that old hound dog.

16
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:15,458
Hey, Blue?

17
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:18,695
Come on, Blue. I got a
big old catfish head for you.

18
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:21,066
Come on, Blue.

19
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,209
Never seen such a crickety
dang pit in my whole life.

20
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,345
Stuck up all over
here and everything.

21
00:02:30,683 --> 00:02:32,878
-Are you Will Stockdale?
-Howdy.

22
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,619
Three dang times this
month, I've been out here--

23
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,519
Don't you point your
finger in my boy's face.

24
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:41,660
Are you threatening
me with a firearm?

25
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,092
I'm a government
representative on business.

26
00:02:44,263 --> 00:02:47,528
Busting up here without
saying howdy or nothing.

27
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,636
-What government?
-U.S. government. The draft board.

28
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,500
This boy's been called for
the draft. He never reported.

29
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,732
He's a draft dodger.

30
00:02:55,908 --> 00:03:00,436
Fold in that finger, sir. I'm
warning you, fold in that finger.

31
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,275
He could go to jail for
that. He's in today's group.

32
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,814
And this is your last chance.

33
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,111
If you don't leave with
that group at 12 a.m...

34
00:03:07,286 --> 00:03:10,380
...you're gonna be in more
trouble than you ever did see.

35
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:12,524
You already got one
offense against you.

36
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,183
-Not answering my letters.
-I never got no letters.

37
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:18,853
Don't tell me you can't read. You
could've got somebody to read them to you.

38
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,465
-So that ain't no excuse.
-You mean to stand there...

39
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:24,125
...and tell me to my
face my boy can't read?

40
00:03:24,303 --> 00:03:26,100
-Now, look--
-You think my boy...

41
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,705
...who has gone to school...

42
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:31,002
...and who has read more times
than you could shake a stick at...

43
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:34,305
...couldn't read a puny little
old letter, if he wanted to?

44
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,913
By dog, sir.

45
00:03:36,082 --> 00:03:37,606
I never got no letters.

46
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,144
I don't think I can stand
to listen to any more of this.

47
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:43,455
Get that book.

48
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,218
No, sir, what you think
don't mean nothing to me...

49
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,794
...but we are gonna settle this
here question right here and now...

50
00:03:50,963 --> 00:03:54,126
...and not have no
more foolishness about it.

51
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,331
Read at him.

52
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:05,069
"Once there was a
boy named Tony...

53
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:07,576
...who wanted a pony.

54
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,547
So he went to his mama and said:

55
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:14,311
'May I have a pony? '

56
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,183
And his Mama says:

57
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:22,986
'No, Tony, you may
not have a pony.'"

58
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:25,292
Go on.

59
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,961
"So he went to
his papa and said:

60
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,700
'Papa, may I have a pony? '

61
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,901
And his papa says:

62
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:43,412
'No, Tony, you may not have...

63
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,341
...a pony.'"

64
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:49,112
End of the book, he
gets the pony anyhow.

65
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:52,985
Now that we have settled
if or not my boy can read--

66
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,559
-Pa.
--you best be getting off my property...

67
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,196
...and back in that car of
yours and out of range--

68
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:00,832
-Pa, be Christian to him.
-Christian?

69
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,900
You know what the
Lord would've done...

70
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:06,232
...if a man come all hot and
stomping onto his property...

71
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:08,202
...without saying
howdy or nothing?

72
00:05:08,407 --> 00:05:11,604
Scaring his chickens and
saying folks can't read?

73
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:15,943
Sir, would it be all right if
me and Pa speak private-like?

74
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:19,607
-Okay, but make it short.
-Thank you, sir.

75
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:21,446
Come on, Pa.

76
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:24,917
And don't try any funny business.
Because I ain't alone here.

77
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,121
Set yourself, Pa.

78
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,525
Now, listen, Pa.

79
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:36,827
I don't think this here
draft's such a bad idea.

80
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,130
I mean, I'd kind of like to go.

81
00:05:39,305 --> 00:05:43,765
There's a whole lot of fellas there and
they all march along right, snappy like.

82
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:45,877
You listen to me, boy.

83
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:49,276
Going in the draft don't
mean just going into town.

84
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:52,815
It means Macon and
Atlanta and still further.

85
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:58,082
I've been to Atlanta, you know
that. When I was no older than you.

86
00:05:58,257 --> 00:06:03,251
I told you how them folks laughed
at me and called me smart names.

87
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,987
You don't want that, boy.

88
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,433
-Pa, now ain't the same as it was then.
-Dogged if it ain't.

89
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:14,062
But they want me. They even sent a
fella to come and fetch me, didn't they?

90
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,707
And that ain't all.

91
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,709
Last spring, I seen a sign on
the sidewalk down there in town.

92
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,508
This great big old
picture of Uncle Sam.

93
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,084
"And Uncle Sam wants
you," he's a-saying.

94
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,982
Just like this fellow here, Pa, pointing
his finger right straight in my face.

95
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:35,688
Don't you think a soldier fella
come up to me right then and there...

96
00:06:35,861 --> 00:06:39,092
...inviting me to come
along with all the other fellas?

97
00:06:39,865 --> 00:06:42,698
I told him how you
was ailing then...

98
00:06:42,868 --> 00:06:46,429
...and would he
kindly wait a while.

99
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:51,466
You've been tearing up
them letters, ain't you, Pa?

100
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:57,107
And you ain't ailing no more.

101
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:14,158
-Hey, are you coming or do I have to--
-I'm just fixing to get me my shoes.

102
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,128
You've got to know this:

103
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,101
He's a good boy.

104
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:22,832
It's my blame he didn't
come when he should've.

105
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:25,477
I don't care who or why,
mister. We got him now.

106
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:29,046
Remember, Pa? I got these
here for Aunt Tuzie's funeral.

107
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,776
Ain't it nice I'm finally getting
a chance to wear them again?

108
00:07:34,186 --> 00:07:36,177
Appears they liked
to have shrunk a little.

109
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,879
They'll put shoes
on you in Army.

110
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,252
And ain't gonna wait
for you to put them on.

111
00:07:40,426 --> 00:07:45,125
Listen, draft man, you tell them
folks to be nice to my boy, you hear?

112
00:07:45,297 --> 00:07:47,697
-lf they ain't, I'll--
-I'm ready.

113
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,668
Say goodbye to Blue for me
when he wakes up, will you?

114
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:01,210
I will.

115
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:06,313
-Write to me regular, you hear?
-Sure, Pa.

116
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:09,778
Print big.

117
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,119
I will.

118
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:16,953
Remember, draft
man, what I said.

119
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,064
-lf they ain't good to my boy....
-Yeah, I'll remember.

120
00:08:20,232 --> 00:08:22,166
Come on, boy, we gotta go.

121
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:25,360
-Bye, Pa.
-Bye, Will.

122
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,800

Fill it out. Last name first, first

129
00:08:50,896 --> 00:08:54,627

130
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,824
Why, Stanton, honey...

131
00:08:56,001 --> 00:09:00,028
...you all know your little Rosabelle's
just gonna die of loneliness.

132
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,639
Honey, baby doll.

133
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:03,035

going to the Air Force?

137
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,746
That's where I'm driving the
bus to. You want a reserved seat?

138
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:20,084
All right. Save the
jokes for the plowboys.

139
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:22,750
Fill it out. Last name, first

141
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:36,205
Hey, look, they're
bringing a fella in bracelets.

142
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,811
Finally latched onto
him, Mr. McKinney?

143
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,745
-Did he give you any trouble?
-Trouble?

144
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,147
Ain't no draft dodger
gonna give me any trouble.

145
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:49,651
Had to borrow the
sheriff's handcuffs.

146
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,881
That'll hold you till I
get you on that bus.

147
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:54,924
-But, Mr. McKinney, I ain't dodging nothing.
-Shut up.

148
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,721
Let me have it.

149
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:00,990
Fill it out. Last name first, first name,
middle name last. Lean on the pump.

150
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:05,160
-Last name first--
-First name, middle name last.

151
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:06,734
Huh.

152
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,905
-All right, any you boys had any ROTC?
-I did. Close to a year.

153
00:10:14,346 --> 00:10:16,712
-What's your name?
-Blanchard, Irving S.

154
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:19,146
Irving? Okay, Irving.

155
00:10:19,318 --> 00:10:21,582
I'm setting you in
charge of this here group.

156
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:23,813
When you get to your
classification center...

157
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:26,423
...give these forms to the
sergeant of your barracks.

158
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:30,255
-What about him?
-Keep them cuffs on him. Here are the keys.

159
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,591
It took me three months to
flush him out of them hills...

160
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,257
...so see that he
don't get away.

161
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:39,067
Come on in my office,
Dave, I'll give you your money.

162
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,398
Whew.

163
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:47,334
You hear what he said, Plowboy? I
don't want any trouble, you understand?

164
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,846
-Me, neither, Irving.
-My name's Blanchard to you.

165
00:10:51,016 --> 00:10:53,576
It's a real pleasure.

166
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:55,811
You getting smart
with me, Plowboy?

167
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,684
I don't wanna hear
one peep out of you.

168
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,883
Not one peep.

169
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:11,602
All right, I ain't had my morning coffee,
so I ain't gonna wait around to see you off.

170
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,965
Now, Irving here's in charge.

171
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:16,300
Callville is proud of
her sons in uniform...

172
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,636
...so show them what
kind of men we raise here.

173
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:22,247
And be good. And if you
can't be good, be careful.

174
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,614
Rosabelle!

175
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:33,815
Pa.

176
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,127
Get on home!

177
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:37,319
Yes, Pa.

178
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,623
I told you to stay
home this time!

179
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,194
Dang it.

180
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,100
All right, all right, into the
bus when I call your name.

181
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:51,505
-Deroy, Richard S.
-Here.

182
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,406
-Farnum, Robert E.
-Here.

183
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,308
-Hooper, Junior C.
-Here.

184
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,609
-Lemon, Henry P.
-Here.

185
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:02,311
-Stockdale, Will.
-Uh-- Here.

186
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,481
I'll get around to you.

187
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,521
-Swineburn, Armand A.
-Here.

188
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,194
Whitledge, Benjamin B.

189
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,663
Whitledge, Benjamin B.

190
00:12:15,834 --> 00:12:17,358
Here, here. Whitledge, here.

191
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:19,629
-Benjamin B. Is Mr. McKinney here?
-Who?

192
00:12:19,805 --> 00:12:23,434
Mr. McKin-- Mr. McKinney, the man
on the draft board. I got a letter for him.

193
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,509
Take it easy, sonny.
You just missed him.

194
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:28,875
-Oh, I gotta find him. I got a letter for him.
-He left me in charge.

195
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:33,451
Hey, give me that. That's a private letter.
It's official business for Mr. McKinney.

196
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,018
Don't you understand English?

197
00:12:36,188 --> 00:12:38,281
I'm in charge.

198
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:43,093
And here, fill out that form.

199
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:47,496
-That's a private letter, you big--
-Hey.

200
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:50,326
Don't get sore
at Irving, feller.

201
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:52,470
He's had ROTC.

202
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,664
That doesn't give him the
right to push me around.

203
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:00,575
Hey, you put your last name
first, and then your first name.

204
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:01,906
Like this.

205
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,312
Stockdale, Will. Will Stockdale.

206
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,044
Stockdale. Stockdale?

207
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,381
All you need is one of each.

208
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,148
Is that all?

209
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,122
Wise guy. Oh.

210
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:19,087
Much obliged.

211
00:13:19,264 --> 00:13:20,993
What's the matter with you?

212
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:25,125
Oh, they think I'm a
draft dodger, but I ain't.

213
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:28,899
Here, give me. You can't
write good with handcuffs.

214
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:32,237
Thanks. Can't write much
good without them. Heh.

215
00:13:32,911 --> 00:13:35,072
-"Ever had measles? "
-No.

216
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,771
-"The mumps? "
-No.

217
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:38,678
-"Chickenpox? "
-No.

218
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:44,915
-"Any other communicable diseases? "
-I reckon not.

219
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,692
You figure they gonna
make me go back home?

220
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,294
-"Ever break any bones? "
-Broke a leg bone once.

221
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,726
-"Which leg? "
-The r-- No, it was the left.

222
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,559
Yeah, left. Left.

223
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,395
"Any member of your
family belong to groups...

224
00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:02,529
...planning to overthrow the
government by unconstitutional means? "

225
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,906
No, we're pretty satisfied.

226
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,906
-He still limps a mite.
-Who does?

227
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,106
That fellow whose
leg bone I broke.

228
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,378
He hit me first.

229
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,120
You ever have ROTC?

230
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,829
No.

231
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:28,489
Hey, Irving had
it. Close to a year.

232
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:32,296
He's so jumpy and all, I figure
he's still got a touch of it in him.

233
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,138
-Listen, Stockdale, ROTC--
-Will's my name.

234
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:39,106
-Will, listen, ROTC ain't--
-What was yours again?

235
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,975
-Ben. Ben Whitledge. ROTC--
-Howdy.

236
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:45,611
Hi.

237
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:50,385
Look, Will, ROTC ain't
a disease. It's training.

238
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,083
Reserve Officer
Training, uh, Corporation.

239
00:14:54,259 --> 00:14:57,592
-Heh. Is that the truth?
-Oh, sure. There's different kinds.

240
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:02,427
There's cavalry ROTC,
artillery ROTC, infantry ROTC.

241
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:07,504
-Infantry's the best.
-Yeah, that's what I always thought.

242
00:15:09,374 --> 00:15:13,902
-Ben, Irving ain't sick?
-No.

243
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,944
And he don't rank
no higher than we do.

244
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:20,108
Because ROTC don't mean
nothing unless you finish the course.

245
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,043
Hey, get this.

246
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,513
"So I beg of you, Mr. McKinney.

247
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,626
Please get my enclosed letter to the
commanding officer in the Air Force."

248
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,955
Hey, you can't read that.

249
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:34,031
"So that my son Ben
will be put in the infantry...

250
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,667
...the same as his six
brothers before him."

251
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:39,360
Give me that, you big--
Let go. Let-- Let go of me!

252
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:43,702
"All his life, little Ben has been dreaming
of being a real infantry soldier...

253
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:45,901
...like all the men
in our family."

254
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:48,122
Little Ben wanna be
a great big soldier?

255
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,639
Irving?

256
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,320
That letter belongs to
Ben. Now, you give it to him.

257
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:59,287
I told you to keep your
mouth shut, Plowboy.

258
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:04,927
"It'll break his poor heart if he's put in
the Air Force instead of the infantry...

259
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,327
...so his brothers
will be proud of him."

260
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:13,400
Irving, you ain't sick like I
thought, so you give Ben his letter.

261
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,506
Listen, Plowboy.

262
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:23,907
Yeah, sure.

263
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:27,181
I imagine it's time for
us to get going, ain't it?

264
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:29,843
So I'd thank you if you'd
take these off, Irving.

265
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,458
-They're beginning to chafe me a mite.
-Yeah.

266
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:36,192
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

267
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,659
All right, let's stop kidding around
here. Climb aboard there. Snappy now.

268
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,199
Why, sure, Irving.

269
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,031
All right, move
along. Move along.

270
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,699
So long, boys. Don't
take any wooden nickels.

271
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,179
I appreciate if you write me how
much it cost to get it fixed, Mr. McKinney.

272
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,079
Bye.

273
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,929
It sure was interesting when
we got to the classification center.

274
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,902
They took us around from
one building to another.

275
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,235
And they stuck
needles into our arms...

276
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:27,378
...and whomped us on the
knees with a little rubber hammer...

277
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,073
...and mashed down our
tongues with an ice cream stick.

278
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,445
Then after a real nice supper...

279
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:37,180
...I never had such a fill
of beans in my whole life...

280
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:39,347
...we was all setting
around the barracks...

281
00:17:39,524 --> 00:17:42,049
...in our snappy new uniforms
learning how to salute...

282
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,822
...everybody talking and joking
and feeling the back of their necks...

283
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:48,523
...where they had these
horse clippers run over them...

284
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:53,160
...when this nice fella,
this here sergeant, come in.

285
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,340
Hey. MAN 2:
Why, there's the sergeant.

286
00:17:59,811 --> 00:18:02,780
Please, let's keep it quiet.

287
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:05,546
On behalf of the president
of the United States...

288
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:09,175
...Secretary of the Air Force, commanders
of this base and this squadron...

289
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,517
...I wanna welcome you, gentlemen,
to the United States Air Force.

290
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:17,253
This is a classification center where you will
undergo tests, both physical and mental...

291
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,796
...designed to determine your
abilities so that you may be trained...

292
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:24,402
...for the position from which
both you and the Air Force...

293
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:27,037
...will derive the
greatest benefit.

294
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,741
Tests are for you own good,
so do your best in every test.

295
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:36,438
My name is King.
K-l-N-G, Sergeant King.

296
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:40,449
I'm in charge of the barracks where
you will be billeted for two weeks.

297
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:46,057
During that period, the barracks
will be kept spotlessly clean.

298
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:51,028
This may be a stopping off place
for you, but for me, it is home.

299
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,524
Before turning in tonight, every one of you
will write a letter to his nearest of kin...

300
00:18:55,701 --> 00:19:00,900
...informing them that you have arrived
safely and are in the best of health.

301
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:04,804
If any problem should arise, feel
free to consult me about its solution.

302
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:07,501
I am here to help you...

303
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,843
...during these first difficult
days of military service.

304
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:17,112
These are my quarters.

305
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,888
Knock before entering.

306
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,058
That understood? MEN: Yes, sir.

307
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,894
Roger.

308
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:31,192
Wilco.

309
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,547
Seemed like a
right friendly fella.

310
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,382
Be right back.

311
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:59,020
Come in.

312
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,258
Private Blanchard...

313
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:07,269
...delivering forms on 12
inductees from Callville as ordered.

314
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,340
You keep standing like that,
you're gonna pull a muscle.

315
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,970
Just put them down.

316
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:16,046
Not on the bed, please.

317
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:25,648
Anything else?

318
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:29,487
Sergeant, I feel it's my duty to tell
you about one of the Callville inductees.

319
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:33,028
Fella named Stockdale.
A draft dodger.

320
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,132
He gave me a lot of trouble.

321
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,325
Not on the bed, please.

322
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,303
I was put in charge and
he gave me a lot of trouble.

323
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:48,344
They brought him
to the bus in these.

324
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:52,446
I'll make a note of it.

325
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:55,108
I think he'll need some
disciplinary action.

326
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:59,621
He already hit one of the
fellas with a gasoline pump.

327
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:03,192
-In the barracks here?
-No, back at the bus station.

328
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,830
I'll make a note of it.

329
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,398
I thought he ought to be reported
to the squadron commander.

330
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,834
-Oh, no.
-Well, I mean, I think it's my duty to--

331
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:16,473
Any reporting done
around here, I do it.

332
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,810
Sure you do. And this fella
Stockdale's a real troublemaker.

333
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,970
Look, sonny, how long
have you been in the service?

334
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:28,044
About six hours, I guess.
I had ROTC though.

335
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,780
I suppose they told
you it was all efficiency...

336
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,481
...standing at attention,
running around.

337
00:21:33,658 --> 00:21:38,686
Well, I've been in for 18 years
and it ain't like you think it is at all.

338
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:43,563
It's a quiet, peaceful life, if
you mind your own business.

339
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:46,568
It's like there was a
big lake, nice and calm.

340
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:50,401
I'm in a canoe, you're in another, the
captain's in a canoe and the colonel.

341
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:53,942
You know what you do if you report
somebody or complain about somebody...

342
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,875
...or request something?

343
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:59,046
You make waves.

344
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,553
Well, I thought the captain would
wanna know if he's got a troublemaker.

345
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,249
I hate to pull rank on you,
but for your information...

346
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:12,362
...you got the smallest canoe in
the whole lake. Good night, private.

347
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:17,558
And now our next request...

348
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:21,502
...comes from Master
Sergeant Orville C. King...

349
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,937
...at the Air Force
classification center.

350
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,337
Here you are, Sergeant.

351
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:55,735
Hey, Ben, do you put
a big "S" on "sergeant"?

352
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,239
When you print it, it don't
make no difference, Will.

353
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,106
Oh. Boy, Pa'll sure be happy...

354
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,611
...about how Sergeant King
said it was really a home.

355
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,922
-No, come on, Ben, you take the bottom.
-No, Will.

356
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:15,025
-But, honest, I like sleeping high.
-No, sir. You sat on the bottom bunk first.

357
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,286
I didn't mean nothing
by it. Honest, I didn't.

358
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,726
First come, first serve.
That's the military way.

359
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,594
-No, now come on, Ben.
-I won't, I tell you!

360
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:26,203
-Now, come on.
-Let that man alone, Stockdale.

361
00:23:26,371 --> 00:23:29,499
I'm beginning to think I never
should've taken the cuffs off of you.

362
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,374
Well, Irving, I wasn't
doing nothing. I was just--

363
00:23:32,544 --> 00:23:35,809
Look, if you want some fighting,
you go after somebody your own size.

364
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,643
-Not some little mouse.
-Watch your mouth!

365
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,614
Why don't you mind
your own business?

366
00:23:40,785 --> 00:23:43,345
We're just stopping him
from wrestling you around.

367
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:45,546
That's between him and
me, nobody asked you.

368
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:46,816
Now, Ben, don't--

369
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:51,429
-Only trying to do you a favor, junior.
-Who you calling Junior?

370
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,291
Who asked you anything, anyhow?

371
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:55,763
All right, if that's the
way you feel about it.

372
00:23:55,934 --> 00:24:00,200
You wanna be buddies with draft dodger,
be buddies with the draft dodger. Go ahead.

373
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:03,603
-That's the way I feel about it.
-All right, before there's trouble...

374
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,209
...you hit the sack.
Get to bed, both of you.

375
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,105
I was just going to, Irving.

376
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,214
Give him time,
Irving, beds is strange to Plowboy.

377
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,248
He's used to
sleeping with the hogs.

378
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:17,386
-What's the matter with you, anyhow?
-Me?

379
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:20,547
Taking their insults and
heehawing like a dang donkey.

380
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:22,750
They don't mean
nothing by it, Ben.

381
00:24:22,927 --> 00:24:25,862
Besides, I thought that one about
sleeping with the hogs is kind of funny.

382
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:27,396
-Aww....
-Heh-heh.

383
00:24:27,565 --> 00:24:30,500
Well, see, I figure if we
just laugh with them...

384
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:34,537
...why, pretty soon they'll get tired of
carrying on, there won't be no ruckus.

385
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:37,675
You think a-laughing is
gonna stop these guys?

386
00:24:37,842 --> 00:24:40,504
A-licking is all
they understand.

387
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:43,706
-You think so?
-I know so.

388
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:47,010
And you behaving
like a dang donkey.

389
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,861
Oh, what's he holding?

390
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,031
- You know...?
- Oh, yeah.

391
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,224
I'm through.

392
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:04,868
-Yeah, I've had enough.
-Me too.

393
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,628
Yeah.

394
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:10,966
Lonesome for the hogs, Plowboy?

395
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:13,372
Ain't used to living
indoors, are you, Plowboy?

396
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:16,412
Look, Plowboy, you
want us to tuck you in bed?

397
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,550
I bet your pa always
tucked you in nice and comfy.

398
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:22,687
Wonder what kind
of hog his pa is.

399
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,322
Chester White or Poland China?

400
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,427
I ain't gonna trouble
you fellas none...

401
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:34,997
...because I know you
was all just put up to it.

402
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,929
Excuse me.

403
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:43,033
Irving, stand up and
take off them glasses.

404
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:47,144
-Why?
-I aim to bust you up some.

405
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:52,977
Look, Stockdale,
I'm not alone now.

406
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:55,449
There's five of us here.

407
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:59,079
Hit him! MAN
2: Hey, do not, Plowboy.

408
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,281
Come on.

409
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:03,450
Time out. MAN 5:
Come on, Plowboy, hit him.

410
00:26:04,329 --> 00:26:06,160
That's the end of it.

411
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:13,135
Come on,
man. - Come on.

412
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,178
Knock it off. Knock it off.

413
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:28,882
Knock it off!

414
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:37,060
Aren't you gentlemen starting in
a bit early to tip over my canoe?

415
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:40,197
Sergeant, let me try to explain.

416
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,128
Shut up.

417
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,467
No, I am not in the
mood for explanations.

418
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,537
I am quite tired.

419
00:26:47,705 --> 00:26:49,229
You understand?

420
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:52,035
And I want no more noise.

421
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,075
You understand, gentlemen?

422
00:26:56,614 --> 00:27:00,710
I will be more than willing to
listen to explanations in the morning.

423
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:04,387
And as morning likes to come
a little early in the service...

424
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:06,683
...we'll help it along.

425
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,554
We won't wait for taps.

426
00:27:10,495 --> 00:27:12,360
Get to your bunks.

427
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,761
On the double! Ooh!

428
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,273
He seems a mite upset.

429
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,431
Oh, Will.

430
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:30,373
We better put Irving in his bed. He
won't wanna disobey the sergeant.

431
00:27:32,517 --> 00:27:34,508
You get his feet.

432
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:45,821
Let him alone, please, Will.

433
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,557
He'll wake up and
cause some more trouble.

434
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,894
Yeah, I reckon he might.

435
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:56,405
-Pretty good fight, though, wasn't it?
-Dog it, Will, this'll mess up everything.

436
00:27:56,574 --> 00:27:59,236
-What will, Ben?
-Fighting in the barracks.

437
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,537
But you said licking
was all they'd understand.

438
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,078
Not in the barracks.

439
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:06,809
One of them's bound to snitch
tomorrow that we started a fight.

440
00:28:07,218 --> 00:28:10,244
Dog it, I'll never get
in the infantry now.

441
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:13,913
If we kept our mouths shut and didn't
do nothing, we might get transferred.

442
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,457
Both of us?

443
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,857
But now, they're sure
to tell about the fight.

444
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,496
No, they won't.

445
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:23,327
If one of them says anything, I'll take
him out in the back and whomp him good.

446
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,492
Now, there you go, Will.

447
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,400
You think the infantry
wants men like that?

448
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:31,474
No, they want men who can
take it and keep their mouths shut...

449
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:33,577
...the way a man ought to do.

450
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:35,741
Transfer?

451
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:39,411
We'll be lucky if they don't
transfer us into the Navy.

452
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:42,246
Walking around in them
little old white uniforms.

453
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:45,184
Do you really want both
of us to transfer, Ben?

454
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:49,349
Don't you understand, Will? It's
the infantry does the real fighting.

455
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:51,620
All the rest is just helpers.

456
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:54,264
Look at the War Between
the States. How about that?

457
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:55,922
Yeah. How about that?

458
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,125
See what I mean?

459
00:28:58,803 --> 00:29:01,033
Every man in my family's
been in the infantry...

460
00:29:01,205 --> 00:29:03,366
...clear back to
my great grandpa.

461
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:04,838
You know what he done?

462
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,375
Fought with Stonewall
Jackson at Chancellorsville.

463
00:29:07,545 --> 00:29:10,378
Licked him good too, I bet.

464
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:14,979
By dog.

465
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:23,158
First thing tomorrow, I'm gonna get
sergeant's permission to see the captain.

466
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:27,026
I'll give him Ma's letter
and I'll.... And I'll....

467
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:29,792
Oh, what's the use?

468
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:33,060
What's the use?

469
00:29:33,237 --> 00:29:36,900
Hey. Hey, Ben, maybe
you'll get to like the Air Force.

470
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:43,139
Zooming all over the sky and shouting
"roger" and "wilco" and everything.

471
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,839
Maybe it won't be so bad.

472
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,681
Bad?

473
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,753
You know what they
call men in the Air Force?

474
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,355
Airmen.

475
00:29:52,523 --> 00:29:54,753
Like something out
of a dang funny book.

476
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,257
Airman.

477
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:59,089
How you gonna like it when
somebody calls you "airman"?

478
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,294
By dog, I just don't
think I'll stand for it.

479
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:06,460
Hey, long as we gotta lie in the
dark, give us a chance to get some sleep.

480
00:30:06,637 --> 00:30:08,434
-Knock it off. MAN
2: Yeah, hit the--

481
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:13,806
Airman.

482
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,637
Somebody brung their trumpet.

483
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,706
Hey, Ben.

484
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,347
Hey. Hey, Ben.

485
00:31:57,982 --> 00:32:01,179
All right, I'm up, I'm up. All
right, I'm up. All right, I'm up.

486
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:02,751
All right, I'm up.

487
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,114
Howdy, I'm Will Stockdale.

488
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:06,654
I didn't hear the whistle.
Tell the men to line up.

489
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,952
If the captain comes around, tell
him I'm checking on who overslept.

490
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:13,256
I'll be out there just
as quick as I can....

491
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,692
It's 12:00 at night.

492
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:20,729
It is?

493
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,563
Oh....

494
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:27,233
That's a prettiest watch.

495
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:29,402
You woke me.

496
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:32,405
Well, you said to
knock before entering.

497
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:35,017
Why did you wake me?

498
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:37,711
This ain't nothing personal
against you, sergeant...

499
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,915
...no, that we don't like your
barracks no, nothing like that.

500
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:45,426
What it is, is Ben's got these
six brothers that's all infantry.

501
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:50,196
That's my new buddy
Ben, that's asleep out there?

502
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:53,599
So naturally, he don't wanna
be in no Air Force. Heh-heh.

503
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,401
I mean, with the infantry doing the real
fighting and the Air Force being the helpers.

504
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:08,209
Well, you know, like in the
War Between the States?

505
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:12,015
So he wants to transfer and he
wants me to go along with him.

506
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,954
I figured you could
do it for us. Heh-heh.

507
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,154
I heard what you
said out there...

508
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:23,767
...about how you was here to help us during
first difficult days of military service.

509
00:33:26,103 --> 00:33:31,040
Why do they send all the bums
and the idiots to my barracks?

510
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:34,735
-They do?
-Yes.

511
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,142
Yes, they do.

512
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:40,043
Sure must be a mess.

513
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,713
-Whatever your name is, get out--
-Stockdale.

514
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:47,756
Stockdale, I want you to
get out of this-- Stockdale?

515
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,654
Don't you come near me.

516
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:53,354
Get out of this room and get back in
your bunk and go to sleep. That's all.

517
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,158
Yes, sir.

518
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:58,124
Ben did say the captain
was the one to see--

519
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:00,634
-Stockdale, where you going?
-To the captain.

520
00:34:00,805 --> 00:34:02,363
Oh, no.

521
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,839
But Ben, he knows all about
doing things military and--

522
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:09,002
Oh, no. You can't,
you can't. You just:

523
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,307
Oh, you can't do it.

524
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:14,508
Captain would just as soon rip
off your stripes as look at you.

525
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:17,085
-Well, I ain't got no stripes.
-Wait a minute.

526
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:21,218
Now, you'll never get transfers
by waking up the captain.

527
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:25,522
He won't understand.
Believe me, he won't.

528
00:34:26,631 --> 00:34:31,398
-Well, I'll go over it real slow.
-Wait a minute.

529
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:35,237
Now, if you want the
captain to do you a favor...

530
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,897
...you've gotta do a
favor for the captain.

531
00:34:38,075 --> 00:34:39,838
Yeah, that's it.

532
00:34:40,011 --> 00:34:42,741
Now, how would you like to
do a big favor for the captain?

533
00:34:42,913 --> 00:34:45,177
-Me?
-Come on. That's it.

534
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:49,479
Come on. You do one for him, he'll
do one for me and I'll do one for you.

535
00:34:49,654 --> 00:34:53,818
That's the way it works out in the
service. Now you just go right on in here.

536
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:02,332
Now do you know what this is?

537
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,135
It's a kind of a big
outhouse, ain't it?

538
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:09,371
-We call it the latrine.
-La-- Latrine.

539
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,008
-Uh-huh.
-Heh. How about that?

540
00:35:12,176 --> 00:35:15,907
You might say it's the captain's hobby,
he inspects it every chance he gets.

541
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,914
And when it sparkles,
why he sparkles too.

542
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:22,143
Now, you get it all cleaned up.

543
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,151
You are the officer in charge.

544
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,546
In charge?

545
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:30,057
Every last one
of them, all yours.

546
00:35:30,227 --> 00:35:33,025
Golly.

547
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:36,360
Now, you just stay right
here and don't go no place.

548
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:40,834
-You bet. Good night.
-Good night.

549
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,273
Hey, thank you.

550
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,318
Well, it just goes
to show you...

551
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:58,182
...how good things happen to you
when you're least expecting them.

552
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:02,956
Well, get started.

553
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:09,426
I stayed officer in charge
of this here latrine all night long.

554
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,397
Rubbing and scrubbing...

555
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:15,630
...and doing my best to make
things sparkle like Sergeant King said.

556
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:18,206
And then I stayed on
through breakfast too...

557
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,368
...because I wanted to
do a right good job of it.

558
00:36:21,545 --> 00:36:24,343
So Sergeant King would be real
pleased how things come out...

559
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,382
...when he come in to
look at it in the morning.

560
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,566
Beautiful.

561
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:56,836
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

562
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,142
-Beautiful.
-Shucks, it ain't hard.

563
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:02,717
Wait'll the captain sees this.

564
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,185
He inspects this like it
was an operating room...

565
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,790
...where somebody was
gonna cut out his heart.

566
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:12,827
Never in your life you've seen such a guy
for sticking his head right down into things.

567
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:16,933
-You figure he'll like what I done?
-He'll be a new man.

568
00:37:19,236 --> 00:37:23,468
Will, how would you like to
be permanent latrine orderly?

569
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:30,012
-Permanent latrine orderly?
-PLO.

570
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:34,207
Golly.

571
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,376
The captain makes
inspection every Saturday.

572
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:39,489
Now, if you could keep everything
as clean as it is right now...

573
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,217
...the captain'll
get off my back.

574
00:37:42,626 --> 00:37:45,322
Gee, I'd sure
like to, sergeant...

575
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:49,660
...but I was kind of set on
helping Ben get them transfers.

576
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,324
You know, he's my buddy.

577
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:55,399
Ain't I your buddy?

578
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:57,167
You are.

579
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:59,639
You help me out, I'll help Ben.

580
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,802
Just don't say anything
about this outside of this room.

581
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,643
I'm going to the record section and
fix it up with a couple of friends of mine.

582
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:08,478
Okay.

583
00:38:08,652 --> 00:38:12,850
Sergeant, don't I have to take them
tests you was talking about yesterday...

584
00:38:13,023 --> 00:38:14,752
...and get myself classified?

585
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:19,120
No, Will, you've
been classified.

586
00:38:28,305 --> 00:38:31,001
If we hurry, we can catch
that picture at the base theater.

587
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:32,574
Not me, Ben.

588
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:36,873
-You said you ain't never seen a picture.
-I know, but I got my duty to do.

589
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:43,252
-You're going back to that latrine again?
-You bet.

590
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,753
It's against the rules for you to be
permanent in the latrine like that.

591
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,186
All week you've been there.

592
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,224
Sergeant King knows
the rules, don't he?

593
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:52,954
Besides, like I told you, he's
doing me and you a favor.

594
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,362
-What favor, will you tell me that?
-I aim to surprise you, Ben.

595
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:01,130
You don't go to lectures or study,
how you gonna get classified?

596
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:03,330
Sergeant King says
I'm already that way.

597
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:07,841
-Are you crazy? Don't you--?
-Now, don't take on so, Ben.

598
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,709
Just wait and see what the captain says
after he makes his inspection tomorrow.

599
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,941
Why you take them
faucets, for instance.

600
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:17,918
I polished them so hard, they
don't say hot and cold no more.

601
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:21,250
What?

602
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,389
At ease.

603
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:36,131
I think you'll be very
pleased here, sir.

604
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,002
Attention.

605
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:45,313
Latrine ready
for inspection, sir.

606
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:53,322
This is incredible. This
is absolutely incredible.

607
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,219
I am pleased.

608
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:56,586
No.

609
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,751
-No, I am happy.
-Thank you, sir. Thank you.

610
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:01,796
-You the one on latrine duty today, private?
-Yes, sir. All week, sir.

611
00:40:01,966 --> 00:40:04,127
-Ahem, ahem.
-You are to be congratulated.

612
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:06,428
Just look at--

613
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:08,898
What did you say?

614
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,535
Me? Nothing, sir.

615
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,974
-Something about all week.
-Uh--

616
00:40:14,612 --> 00:40:18,776
Well, I done my best in one
day, but just to be fair with you...

617
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:21,679
...it took me a week of
scrubbing to get it like this.

618
00:40:21,852 --> 00:40:23,979
Is this man being punished
for some infraction?

619
00:40:24,154 --> 00:40:28,181
-Oh, no, sir. No, sir.
-Oh, heck no, sir. I'm PLO.

620
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:32,157
-You're what?
-Permanent latrine orderly.

621
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,126
Stockdale.

622
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:38,792
Oh, but don't credit me none though,
sir. It's all Sergeant King's doings.

623
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:42,905
He even got it fixed up so I
don't even have to get classified.

624
00:40:43,073 --> 00:40:45,371
-Sir, l--
-What? That's impossible.

625
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:48,978
Oh, no, sir. He fixed it
with some friends of his.

626
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:53,745
Yes, sir. It was him
got me to work so hard...

627
00:40:53,917 --> 00:40:55,885
...telling me how
latrines is your hobby...

628
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:58,988
...and sticking your head
down into things and all.

629
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:07,562
-Sir, I can explain every--
-Now, don't you be bashful, sergeant.

630
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:12,863
Sir, I been wanting to tell you
about what a good sergeant he is.

631
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:16,063
Oh, he solves our
problems for us...

632
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,540
...and helps us out on our
difficult days in military service.

633
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:24,408
And I guess that he's about
the best dang sergeant there is...

634
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:27,880
...in the whole
danged Air Force.

635
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:36,387
Sir, you really ought
to get up off of his back.

636
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:47,130
How long have you
been a sergeant?

637
00:41:48,505 --> 00:41:51,474
-Well, sir, l-- Ahem.
-Speak up.

638
00:41:52,242 --> 00:41:54,142
Sixteen years, sir.

639
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:57,405
And how long do you
expect to remain a sergeant?

640
00:41:57,881 --> 00:41:58,905
Twelve years.

641
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:02,018
You will remain a sergeant
exactly one week. One week.

642
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:05,155
Unless this man completes
the entire classification process...

643
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:08,314
...and is shipped out with the
group he came in with. Understand?

644
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:11,222
Unless this man is out of
here by the end of the week...

645
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:15,661
...you will not be in charge of this
barracks, you will not be a sergeant...

646
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:19,792
...you will in all probability
be a permanent latrine orderly.

647
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,768
PLO.

648
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:27,439
This is not your fault, private.

649
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,971
You've done a fine job.

650
00:42:30,814 --> 00:42:35,251
I have never seen such a
clean latrine in my entire career.

651
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:36,744
Thank you, sir.

652
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,618
It was my aim to get it just as
clean as that operating room...

653
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:46,024
...where they're fixing
to cut out your heart!

654
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,135
You forgot to ask him
about the transfers.

655
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:59,837
What happened?
What did you do it for?

656
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:03,470
Heck, I couldn't see no sense
in me getting all the credit.

657
00:43:07,951 --> 00:43:11,318
We've gotta get you classified right
away. We gotta get you out of here.

658
00:43:12,422 --> 00:43:15,516
You don't want me around no
more? I thought we was buddies.

659
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,884
It ain't what I want, it's
what the captain wants.

660
00:43:19,062 --> 00:43:21,053
Now, we gotta get
you classified in a hurry.

661
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:25,099
You're gonna have to take tests and you're
going to have to talk to a lot of people.

662
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,033
And you're going to
have to work real hard.

663
00:43:28,972 --> 00:43:31,372
Will it help Ben and
me get them transfers?

664
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:36,036
Well, I guarantee you, wherever you go,
they'll bust a gut to get you transferred.

665
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:40,013
Well, I'll work hard all
right, but I don't know.

666
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:42,914
The last test I took was
close on to five years ago...

667
00:43:43,086 --> 00:43:44,849
...and that was
one of them tests...

668
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,547
...where you try this fella's
toothpaste for 10 days...

669
00:43:47,724 --> 00:43:50,693
...and see if your
teeth don't get brighter.

670
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:53,029
And I failed.

671
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:56,396
You been admiring this
watch of mine, haven't you?

672
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,730
I sure have, sergeant. That there's
the prettiest watch I ever seen.

673
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:03,236
You get shipped out of here by
Saturday morning like the captain said...

674
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:04,806
...and it's yours.

675
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,374
-Mine?
-Yours.

676
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:09,671
Golly.

677
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,372
-Now you'll work real hard, right?
-Right.

678
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:14,312
-And not waste any time?
-No, sir.

679
00:44:14,484 --> 00:44:15,508
Good boy.

680
00:44:15,686 --> 00:44:18,246
Now first thing Monday
morning, we start classification.

681
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:21,914
You stay right here around the
barracks and get a lot of rest...

682
00:44:22,092 --> 00:44:24,993
...and relax your head.

683
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:30,828
I'm going down to the testing area
and see if I can borrow some of the tests.

684
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,696
Okay.

685
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:37,739
Tell them I'll give them back
just like I did the toothpaste.

686
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:47,409
This place where they give
us the tests was really something.

687
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:50,985
They had this great big building,
full of doctors, nurses and officers.

688
00:44:54,224 --> 00:44:57,159
All of them walking in and out
and around real quickety-quick...

689
00:44:57,327 --> 00:44:59,295
...and not smiling at nobody.

690
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:02,557
And then there was this place
something like a schoolroom...

691
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:05,793
...where they give us the
tests we had to write out.

692
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:08,164
Time's up, pal.

693
00:45:16,446 --> 00:45:18,846
It was right friendly
of you to wait for me.

694
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:20,745
Thank you.

695
00:45:22,552 --> 00:45:26,044
-How'd you think you did, Will?
-Well, them printed tests they give us...

696
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,590
...they was exactly like the
ones that you borrowed--

697
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,057
Only what?

698
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,131
Only you spent so much time
drumming the answers into me...

699
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:40,794
...we ought to have spent a little
more on the questions they joint up with.

700
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:49,940
Now, you just sit right
down here and wait.

701
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,660
Come on, Will, the
corporal's waiting.

702
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:21,372
Here he is, corporal. Awfully
sorry to keep you waiting.

703
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:30,042
What we do here, private, is to
evaluate your manual dexterity...

704
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:34,520
...on a time scale in relation
to digital visual coordination.

705
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:38,024
Two irregular steel links which
can be interconnected thusly.

706
00:46:38,195 --> 00:46:40,925
I separate them, I join them.

707
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,328
It will be your task,
when I give the signal...

708
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,401
...to place the two links in an
interconnected relationship...

709
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:49,038
...I have just demonstrated.

710
00:46:55,545 --> 00:46:56,978
Uh....

711
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:58,743
I put them together?

712
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,219
That's right, you
put them together.

713
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,878
I'll time you and three
minutes is passing.

714
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:09,355
Now, whatever you
do, don't get nervous.

715
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:12,928
Ready. Go.

716
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:18,795
There you go.

717
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:21,771
Attaboy.

718
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:26,171
-Put them together.
-Sergeant, please.

719
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,470
Nobody ever does this
in less than two minutes.

720
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:30,704
You're not even
supposed to be in here.

721
00:47:30,881 --> 00:47:34,248
This is a special case. He has to
go out with the group he came in with.

722
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:37,046
-It's is a very difficult test.
-I couldn't do it myself.

723
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,984
-What are you talking about?
-I want you to get out of here.

724
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:43,388
-I'd just like to see you try to do it.
-This is my department.

725
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,721
-He's my department.
-That's my door. Get out.

726
00:47:45,896 --> 00:47:47,796
-Get out right this minute.
-Throw me out.

727
00:47:47,964 --> 00:47:50,228
You're not supposed to
be here. This is my watch--

728
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,868
-All right, then watch your watch--
-I'm done.

729
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,060
Stop the watch.

730
00:47:56,606 --> 00:48:00,474
-Look. Look at that.
-He put them together, didn't he?

731
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:04,208
Sergeant! Sergeant!

732
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:07,839
What's the fuss about? You said, "Put
them together," he put them together.

733
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:11,112
Look what he did, for Pete's sake.
How am I gonna mark him on that?

734
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:14,382
You're supposed to be grading
him on this. Can't you do that?

735
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,891
I'm supposed to mark it down
whether they put it back together or not...

736
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:21,656
...and there ain't supposed to be but
one way of doing it and he didn't do it.

737
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:23,857
How you gonna mark
him on a thing like that?

738
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:27,333
Who do you think's gonna pay for
these? Sixteen dollars, they cost.

739
00:48:27,504 --> 00:48:29,495
-lf you think I'm gonna pay $16--
-Corporal!

740
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:30,697
Sixteen lousy dollars!

741
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:34,366
Corporal, I'll be glad to
pay the 16 lousy dollars.

742
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,273
-You will?
-lf he passed the test.

743
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:39,210
He did it wrong. He was
supposed to do it a certain way.

744
00:48:39,382 --> 00:48:42,374
Will, will you step outside
for a minute, have a smoke.

745
00:48:46,656 --> 00:48:48,920
Now, corporal, let's
look at this thing logically.

746
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,027
You need money and I
need him to pass the test.

747
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:56,063
But he did do it
completely wrong.

748
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:03,535
-Ben?
-Will.

749
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:08,269
I ain't seen you all day.
You been in there classifying?

750
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,436
-Yeah.
-Me too. Find out where you're going?

751
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,673
Sergeant King says
maybe gunnery school.

752
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:15,113
That's where I'm going
too if I pass the eye test.

753
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:18,083
-How about that?
-Yeah, how about that?

754
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:21,986
Oh, Ben, you ain't still sad
about not being in the infantry?

755
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,990
The captain didn't
even read my letter.

756
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:26,356
And that plan of yours
sure didn't work so good.

757
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:28,998
I tried to ask the psychiatrist
if he could fix me up.

758
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:31,464
-Yeah, what'd he say?
-He didn't say nothing.

759
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,728
I don't think he
understands so good.

760
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:37,038
I'm just stuck in the
Air Force, that's all.

761
00:49:38,041 --> 00:49:41,238
Hey, Ben, maybe it's the Air
Force that's the real fighters...

762
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:43,242
...and the infantry's
just the helpers.

763
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:44,437
Never.

764
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:47,112
Well, Ben, all you can
do is look at it that way.

765
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:50,185
No. Wait'll my brothers
find out. Airman.

766
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,616
Private.

767
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:55,622
What kind of rowdydow
is this? Pick up that cap.

768
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:56,816
Yes, sir.

769
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:59,791
-Is that a way to treat government property?
-No, sir, ma'am.

770
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:02,727
We're excited because we're
maybe going to the same school.

771
00:50:02,899 --> 00:50:05,094
That's no excuse for--

772
00:50:12,842 --> 00:50:15,072
What's the matter with this one?

773
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,546
-Have you been drinking?
-No, no, sir.

774
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:21,946
Get at attention, Will.

775
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,484
We're sending this to school?

776
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:29,583
Yes, sir, ma'am. If he passes the eye
test, he'll be going to gunnery school.

777
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,923
As what? A target?

778
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,391
No, sir, ma'am.

779
00:50:36,132 --> 00:50:39,067
Let's have no more rowdydow,
understand? No more.

780
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:41,636
Yes, sir. Ma'am.

781
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:59,313
What's the matter
with you, anyhow?

782
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,686
Don't you know enough to come
to attention and salute an officer?

783
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:04,817
-She was a woman.
-Sure she was.

784
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,190
Ain't you ever heard of
the Women's Air Force?

785
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,924
You mean they got one too?

786
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,458
Sure.

787
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:15,694
-Against ours?
-No, Will. They're with us.

788
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:17,669
They're with us 100 percent.

789
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:19,900
-We got to salute them?
-The officers, we do.

790
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:23,045
Didn't you hear that lecture
about military courtesy?

791
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:26,614
I'll be dogged. I never heard
of saluting no woman before.

792
00:51:26,783 --> 00:51:28,648
She ain't a woman,
she's a captain.

793
00:51:28,818 --> 00:51:31,582
I seen a captain there so I
come to attention and saluted.

794
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,779
A captain, that's all.

795
00:51:32,956 --> 00:51:35,447
-A woman captain.
-A "captain" captain.

796
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,321
By dog, don't you
understand nothing, Will?

797
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,020
When you're in uniform,
you ain't supposed to notice...

798
00:51:41,197 --> 00:51:43,461
...whether a person is a
man or a woman or what.

799
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:47,694
A captain's a captain, a major's
a major and a general's a general.

800
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:53,268
Ben, you mean to tell me that you
didn't notice that she was a woman?

801
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,037
A captain, that's all I seen.

802
00:51:56,212 --> 00:51:59,943
Well, dog it, Ben, I knew
she was a woman right off.

803
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:05,180
Honest, Will, sometimes I wonder
how come they took you in the draft at all.

804
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:07,589
Come on, Will.

805
00:52:07,757 --> 00:52:09,816
You too, Whitledge.

806
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:24,506
Well, Will, it looks like you're
just liable to get classified after all.

807
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:28,110
Just shows you what the
Air Force has come down to.

808
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:31,441
-This the fella you want? Whitledge?
-Yeah.

809
00:52:31,614 --> 00:52:33,741
Psychiatrist says he
has a secondary anxiety...

810
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:37,614
...with inferiority and systematized
delusions of persecution.

811
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:39,548
I ain't surprised.

812
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:43,124
Recommends he be considered
to be transferred to the infantry.

813
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:44,924
The infantry?

814
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:47,757
Don't get excited. He
didn't say you have to.

815
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:52,231
Well, yeah, but that's what Ben's
always been wanting, corporal.

816
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:56,771
-Just you tell me what I have to do.
-Well, here. Fill this out.

817
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:59,875
When he's finished, buck it
through to the colonel for approval.

818
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:01,670
If he's crazy enough to want it.

819
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,608
How about that,
Ben? You made it.

820
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,680
Just wait'll my
brothers hear about this.

821
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,875
-Stockdale?
-Yeah.

822
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:14,122
Okay, psychiatrist.

823
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:16,155
Oh, Lord, psychiatrist.

824
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,652
Now, Will, listen carefully.

825
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:24,363
The psychiatrist test is one where
I couldn't get copies of questions...

826
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:25,796
...because there ain't any.

827
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:28,733
The doctor asks you whatever
happens to pop into his head.

828
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:32,773
-So keep your wits about you.
-I'll try.

829
00:53:32,942 --> 00:53:34,534
Hey. Hey.

830
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:38,272
Hey, maybe he'll give me
a transfer too, huh, Ben?

831
00:53:38,448 --> 00:53:41,906
He'll ask you things
like what do you dream?

832
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,109
Okay.

833
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:46,084
Hey, maybe he'll give me
a transfer too, huh, Ben?

834
00:53:46,256 --> 00:53:47,587
Sure, Will.

835
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:53,151
-The psychiatrist is waiting, Stockdale.
-Coming.

836
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:56,690
Wait a minute.

837
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:59,858
The safest thing I guess is just
say that you never dream at all.

838
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:03,665
-Okay. See you later, Ben.
-No dreams.

839
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:13,373
Sergeant?

840
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:15,040
Do you think he can?

841
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:16,276
Can what?

842
00:54:16,453 --> 00:54:19,422
Get transferred too. Maybe
you could talk to the doctor.

843
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,820
Now, don't you
complicate things.

844
00:54:35,138 --> 00:54:37,800
I never have no dreams at all.

845
00:54:44,747 --> 00:54:48,239
-Where are you from, Stockdale?
-Georgia.

846
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:50,915
That's not much
of a state, is it?

847
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:53,578
Well, I don't live
all over the state.

848
00:54:53,756 --> 00:54:57,055
I just live in this
one little place in it.

849
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:03,631
That's where Tobacco
Road is. Georgia.

850
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,995
Not around my section.

851
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,434
Maybe you're from a
different part than me.

852
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:15,442
I've never been there. What's more, I
don't think I would ever wanna go there.

853
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,102
What's your reaction to that?

854
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,872
Well, I don't know--

855
00:55:19,048 --> 00:55:22,609
I would rather live in the rottenest
pigsty in Tennessee or Alabama...

856
00:55:22,785 --> 00:55:25,913
...than the fanciest
mansion in all of Georgia.

857
00:55:28,157 --> 00:55:29,886
How about that?

858
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:34,860
Well, sir, I think where you
wanna live is your business.

859
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:43,132
You don't mind if someone says
something bad about Georgia?

860
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:46,036
I ain't heard nobody say
nothing bad about Georgia.

861
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:48,734
Well, what do you
think I've been saying?

862
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:52,006
Well, to tell you
the truth, sir...

863
00:55:52,181 --> 00:55:55,514
...I ain't been able to get
too much sense out of it.

864
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,980
-Don't you know?
-Now, watch your steps, young man.

865
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,827
Psychiatrists call this
attitude of yours resistance.

866
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:07,257
-You do?
-Yes.

867
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,831
You sense that this interview
is a threat to your security.

868
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:14,936
-You feel yourself in danger.
-Well, kind of I do.

869
00:56:15,104 --> 00:56:16,731
If I don't get
myself classified...

870
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:19,807
...Sergeant King, he won't
give me the wristwatch.

871
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:24,905
He won't.

872
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:29,882
He says I only get it if I'm
classified inside a week.

873
00:56:32,221 --> 00:56:36,817
Do you get along all
right with your mother?

874
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:39,052
No, sir, I can't
hardly say that I do.

875
00:56:39,228 --> 00:56:43,187
Oh, I see. She's very strict with you.
She's always hovering over you. Hmm?

876
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:45,664
-No, sir, just the opposite.
-She's never there?

877
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:49,236
-That's right.
-And you resent this neglect, don't you?

878
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:52,499
-Well, no, sir, I don't resent nothing.
-Oh, come now, son.

879
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:55,701
Now, don't be bashful,
that's a common situation.

880
00:56:55,878 --> 00:56:59,006
-Does she beat you?
-No.

881
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,379
Oh, so defensive.

882
00:57:02,552 --> 00:57:05,350
Well, it's not easy to talk
about your mother, is it?

883
00:57:05,521 --> 00:57:07,785
No, sir. See, she
died when I was born.

884
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:19,565
You could've told
me that sooner.

885
00:57:21,671 --> 00:57:23,935
Do you hate your mama?

886
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:27,474
I figured as how you
said it was so common.

887
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:30,306
I do not hate my mother.

888
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,108
I should hope not.

889
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:37,610
Does she beat you or something?

890
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,081
This is a transference.

891
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:45,489
You're taking your stored up antagonisms
and loosing them in my direction.

892
00:57:46,262 --> 00:57:49,425
Oh, transference. It
happens every day.

893
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:53,501
-It does? To the infantry?
-Yeah--

894
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:55,127
The infantry?

895
00:57:55,304 --> 00:57:58,239
You'd give Ben a transfer and
I wish you'd give me one too.

896
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:02,344
-Because I'd sure love to go along with him.
-Now stop.

897
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:06,843
Now, there are a few more
topics that we have to cover.

898
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:10,281
We will not talk about transfers
and we will not talk about my mother.

899
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:13,388
We will talk about
what I want to talk about.

900
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,853
Do you understand?

901
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:17,719
Yes, sir.

902
00:58:19,495 --> 00:58:21,122
Now, then.

903
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:24,755
-Your father? Living?
-Yes, sir.

904
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:26,498
Oh.

905
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:29,729
-Do you get along with him okay?
-Yes, sir.

906
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:33,364
-Does he ever beat you?
-Ha-ha. You bet.

907
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:35,408
-Hard?
-And how.

908
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:37,944
Boy, there ain't nobody
can beat like my pa can.

909
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:42,048
So this is where the
antagonism comes from.

910
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:44,977
You hate your father, don't you?

911
00:58:46,255 --> 00:58:48,120
No.

912
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:50,756
Hey, I got an
uncle I hate, though.

913
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:54,658
Every time he comes out to the house,
he's wanting to wrestle with the mule...

914
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:59,598
...and the mule gets all wore
out and he gets all wore out.

915
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,439
Well, I don't really
hate him, though.

916
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:06,632
It's just that I ain't
exactly partial to him.

917
00:59:07,543 --> 00:59:10,341
Did I ask you about your uncle?

918
00:59:11,147 --> 00:59:13,411
I thought you wanted to
talk about hating people.

919
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:21,790
Now. Now then.

920
00:59:22,925 --> 00:59:25,450
Um.... Girls.

921
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:28,358
-How do you like girls?
-What girls is that, sir?

922
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:33,059
Well, just girls.
Just any girls.

923
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:37,696
Well, I don't
like just any girls.

924
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:39,273
There's this girl back home...

925
00:59:39,442 --> 00:59:42,070
...that ain't got hair no longer
than a hound dog's and--

926
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,805
Oh, no.

927
00:59:46,949 --> 00:59:49,281
When I say "girls," I don't
mean any specific girl.

928
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:54,082
I just mean, well, girls in
general, you know? Heh. Heh.

929
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,884
Women. Uh--

930
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,754
Sex.

931
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:03,220
Didn't that father of yours ever sit
you down and have a talk with you?

932
01:00:03,699 --> 01:00:05,530
Well, sure he did.

933
01:00:05,701 --> 01:00:07,362
Well?

934
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:10,138
Well, what?

935
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:13,139
Well, what did he say?

936
01:00:20,616 --> 01:00:24,985
Well, there's this one about
these two traveling salesmen.

937
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,883
And their car breaks down in
the middle of this terrible storm.

938
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,323
-Stop.
-They come running up to this farmhouse...

939
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,588
...where this farmer's
got these 14 daughters.

940
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:36,391
-Stop.
-Uh--

941
01:00:37,366 --> 01:00:39,493
Did you heared it already?

942
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:42,296
I did not heared it already.

943
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:45,235
What'd you stop me for?
It's a real knee-slapper.

944
01:00:45,408 --> 01:00:48,741
See, these 14 daughters was all
studying to become trombone players--

945
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,538
Here, look. You
go. You're through.

946
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:54,171
You're perfectly normal. Just
go. Goodbye. Go. Goodbye.

947
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:01,823
Excuse me for saying it, sir...

948
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:05,449
...but I don't think a fella your age
would be so confused about it all...

949
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:08,188
...if you went out and seen
some girls once in a while.

950
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:11,423
Look, out. Out!

951
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:13,729
Yes, sir.

952
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:21,399
Fella's in pretty bad shape.

953
01:01:26,148 --> 01:01:29,083
-Where's Sergeant King?
-He said he'd meet you in the mess hall.

954
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:31,812
Something about he couldn't stand
the strain on an empty stomach.

955
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:34,149
Oh. Thank you.

956
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:36,621
-Stockdale, Will.
-Here.

957
01:01:36,792 --> 01:01:38,282
Eye test in here.

958
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:40,486
I can't. I gotta tell
Sergeant King that--

959
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:43,154
Get in there,
Stockdale, on the double.

960
01:01:44,634 --> 01:01:48,400
Yes, sir. Just be an
extra surprise for him.

961
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:56,376
What's keeping him so long?

962
01:01:56,545 --> 01:01:59,946
He's probably telling the psychiatrist
how he dreams about his pet horse.

963
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:02,084
Oh, cut it out, will you?

964
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:05,049
Ain't I got enough,
sweating this out?

965
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:08,049
Sergeant, can I have
my application a minute?

966
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:12,154
I got a feeling I'm
doomed. I'm doomed.

967
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:14,159
Of all the....

968
01:02:16,832 --> 01:02:20,359
-What the heck you doing that for?
-Guess I changed my mind.

969
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:24,028
This whole thing started from
you hollering to get into the infantry.

970
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:26,140
I changed my mind.

971
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:29,405
Why do I get all the nuts?

972
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:32,972
There he is.

973
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:35,875
Hey, Will, come here, will you?

974
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:38,316
Sorry to keep y'all waiting
so long. Pete, Irving.

975
01:02:38,487 --> 01:02:41,979
Well, what happened, boy?
How'd you do? Where's the form?

976
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:43,990
Well, let me see it.

977
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,492
I wanna see what he had....

978
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:53,263
He passed. He got through.

979
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,801
He's normal.

980
01:02:56,172 --> 01:02:58,072
Attaboy.

981
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:01,676
Yes, sir, you ought to see the way
Will breezes through these tests.

982
01:03:01,844 --> 01:03:04,210
One, two, three. Bim-bam-boom.

983
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,616
Tomorrow morning, I'm gonna run
him down to the little old eye test...

984
01:03:08,784 --> 01:03:11,412
...and by tomorrow
night, he's out of here.

985
01:03:11,787 --> 01:03:15,917
Gunnery school, well, Will
boy? With your eyesight.

986
01:03:16,525 --> 01:03:21,155
This boy told me that he could shoot
the eye out of a turkey at a 100 yards?

987
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,689
I already took the eye test.

988
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:27,234
Uh.... What?

989
01:03:29,905 --> 01:03:31,702
Fella grabbed me
on the way over here.

990
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:35,671
Well, what happened?
Where's the form? Papers?

991
01:03:36,512 --> 01:03:40,039
Fella back there kept the papers,
on account I was the last test.

992
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:43,547
He said it'd all come out on
the bulletin board tomorrow.

993
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:46,286
Well, how'd you do?
You passed, didn't you?

994
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:48,516
-Easy, huh?
-I don't know.

995
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:51,592
He seemed kind of
angry most of the time.

996
01:03:52,294 --> 01:03:54,262
What made you
think he was angry?

997
01:03:59,301 --> 01:04:00,928
Well, he got sort of fussed...

998
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:04,470
...when I was reading this
here sign they had on the wall.

999
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,074
And that was
right hard at first...

1000
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:10,406
...because they was
real peculiar words like:

1001
01:04:10,579 --> 01:04:14,140
Ip, gnxl and buglump.

1002
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:21,616
You were supposed to read
them letters one at a time.

1003
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:24,584
Didn't make much
sense that way neither.

1004
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:28,023
Hey, hey, hey.

1005
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:32,065
Take a look at the colonel and the
wife captain that come in the base.

1006
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:35,397
Boy, is she stacked.

1007
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:38,597
Women officers, that's
one thing I sure don't cotton to.

1008
01:04:38,774 --> 01:04:40,071
What about you, Stockdale?

1009
01:04:40,242 --> 01:04:42,938
-What do you think of them?
-I ain't never seen one.

1010
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:44,579
Ain't you got eyes?

1011
01:04:47,049 --> 01:04:51,509
Will, I want you to turn
around very slowly...

1012
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:57,557
...and look very carefully this time
and tell me exactly what you see.

1013
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:09,494
I see a colonel....

1014
01:05:09,672 --> 01:05:11,333
Yeah.

1015
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:13,770
And a captain.

1016
01:05:14,276 --> 01:05:15,334
That's all.

1017
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:18,276
And the captain's
a woman, isn't she?

1018
01:05:18,914 --> 01:05:24,318
I don't notice whether it's
a man or a woman or what.

1019
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:28,020
All I see is a
captain. That's all.

1020
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:30,448
Yeah.

1021
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:34,356
Oh, no, no, no.

1022
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:38,265
What's the matter, sergeant,
you got a fly in your coffee?

1023
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:41,403
-Can I get you some fresh hot?
-Oh, no, no, Will. No.

1024
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,505
Just go on your way.

1025
01:05:44,673 --> 01:05:50,168
-Your own special way.
-Thanks, sergeant.

1026
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:56,083
Hey, it sure makes me proud to know
you're sure about me getting classified.

1027
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:01,589
He sure didn't pass no eye test.

1028
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,692
And he ain't
gonna be classified.

1029
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:09,858
And I'm gonna be
permanent latrine orderly.

1030
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:15,970
How big do they grow
them turkeys down there?

1031
01:06:16,805 --> 01:06:19,205
No, he can't do this to me.

1032
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:21,275
I'm old and I'm tired...

1033
01:06:21,443 --> 01:06:24,037
...and my constitution
needs peace and security.

1034
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:26,579
Look, sarge. Sarge.

1035
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:28,717
If he wasn't to
get classified...

1036
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:31,751
...and it wasn't your fault,
that'd be all right, wouldn't it?

1037
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:33,548
How? How?

1038
01:06:33,722 --> 01:06:37,351
Supposing he didn't show
up for inspection tomorrow?

1039
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:42,395
And when he finally did show,
he'd been drinking, shall we say?

1040
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:46,933
Listen, Irving, I even got
so I kind of like the kid.

1041
01:06:47,102 --> 01:06:50,868
And I ain't one to go too
far outside regulations.

1042
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:55,903
But if you got an
idea, I'm desperate.

1043
01:06:56,078 --> 01:06:59,206
All you gotta do is
wangle us three passes.

1044
01:06:59,381 --> 01:07:03,044
We'll take him to the Purple
Grotto for a little celebration.

1045
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:08,020
We could take him tonight.

1046
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:10,754
Yeah, we could.

1047
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:48,420
Well, Will, here we
are again. Round two.

1048
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:50,258
I sure do appreciate this.

1049
01:07:50,432 --> 01:07:53,799
I still don't feel right, my glass
being so much bigger than you alls.

1050
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:57,564
Guest of honor always gets the
biggest glass. That's the honor.

1051
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,571
-To Will.
-To Will.

1052
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,209
-Again?
-Come on, come on, come on.

1053
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:05,211
Ha-ha-ha. Whee.

1054
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:20,659
Your Scotch stuff tastes kind of sharp.
I like the other stuff you give me better.

1055
01:08:20,829 --> 01:08:23,593
-You mean the bourbon?
-No, gin.

1056
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:33,997
Yeah. More tangy than sharp.

1057
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:39,247
Sure was nice of you to give me
this celebration party, sergeant.

1058
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:42,841
But I still wish Ben
could've come along too.

1059
01:08:43,252 --> 01:08:44,810
Just couldn't wangle it.

1060
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:49,287
Outside of you, Ben's the only one left
responsible enough for barracks duty.

1061
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:52,757
And tomorrow, we got a real
inspection. The colonel's coming.

1062
01:08:52,928 --> 01:08:56,659
Yeah, Ben's sharp. Come
on, Will, drink it up. Drink it up.

1063
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:07,834
Well, I reckon we ought
to be heading on back.

1064
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:09,637
With the colonel
coming tomorrow...

1065
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:14,044
...I wanna give Ben a hand and get
the barracks cleaned up real special.

1066
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:16,081
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1067
01:09:16,251 --> 01:09:19,618
I told you I was gonna give you my
watch and I'm gonna give you my watch.

1068
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:22,018
We gotta have several,
several drinks on that.

1069
01:09:22,191 --> 01:09:24,091
Golly.

1070
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:28,421
My mother gave it to me.

1071
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:30,998
To Will Stockdale...

1072
01:09:31,166 --> 01:09:34,897
...I am proud of him for
getting classified so good...

1073
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:37,903
...and for cleaning
up the latrine and all.

1074
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:40,974
Thank you.

1075
01:09:41,143 --> 01:09:44,442
Thank you.

1076
01:09:46,548 --> 01:09:49,108
Whoo-hoo!

1077
01:09:49,718 --> 01:09:51,811
To Sergeant King.

1078
01:09:52,588 --> 01:09:54,783
The best dang
sergeant there is...

1079
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:59,553
...in the whole
danged Air Force.

1080
01:10:06,301 --> 01:10:07,768
Ahhh.

1081
01:10:09,104 --> 01:10:12,972
By dog, from a jug, it don't
taste sharp at all, does it?

1082
01:10:14,309 --> 01:10:18,769
Will, are you absolutely sure that you
never drank any whiskey before, at all?

1083
01:10:18,947 --> 01:10:22,405
Never no store whiskey, just
some old stuff my pa makes.

1084
01:10:22,785 --> 01:10:25,652
-Some old stuff that your pa--
-Yeah.

1085
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:27,345
Corn liquor kind of.

1086
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:31,186
You know, corn, grain, kerosene.

1087
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,520
-Kerosene?
-Kerosene?

1088
01:10:33,829 --> 01:10:35,820
Just a mite for flavoring.

1089
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:38,296
Where the heck are we
gonna get some kerosene?

1090
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:40,435
Cigars, cigarettes?

1091
01:10:40,602 --> 01:10:43,366
And anything else
you wanna smoke.

1092
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:46,440
Cigars, cigarettes?

1093
01:10:49,645 --> 01:10:51,840
Why, thank you.

1094
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:56,207
-This ought to come near it.
-Sure.

1095
01:10:57,152 --> 01:11:01,418
He wants kerosene,
he gets kerosene.

1096
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:09,221
It's familiar.

1097
01:11:12,434 --> 01:11:16,302
Hey, there's a
infan-- Hey, infantry.

1098
01:11:17,473 --> 01:11:18,497
Hi.

1099
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:20,505
Let's drink one to the infantry.

1100
01:11:24,379 --> 01:11:27,473
-Have a drink. We're celebrating.
-Hi, Jack.

1101
01:11:27,649 --> 01:11:30,618
Thanks a lot. I
do not mind if I do.

1102
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:33,550
-To the infantry.
-To the infantry.

1103
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:36,717
To the infantry.

1104
01:11:54,676 --> 01:11:58,168
So....

1105
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:03,718
Say, I didn't know you fly
boys were so nice to the infantry.

1106
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:07,253
Hey, heck, it's the air age and
you're our helpers, ain't you?

1107
01:12:07,422 --> 01:12:10,880
-Your what?
-Our helpers.

1108
01:12:11,059 --> 01:12:13,619
Don't think we don't
appreciate it too.

1109
01:12:13,795 --> 01:12:17,822
Listen, listen, fellas.
You're a nice bunch of fellas.

1110
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:23,905
Fellas, you got it easier
than anybody, even the Navy.

1111
01:12:24,072 --> 01:12:25,232
Easy.

1112
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:30,071
We got the roughest, toughest,
meanest sergeants in the whole service.

1113
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:31,803
Go on.

1114
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:36,440
You don't know what a tough sergeant
is until you've been in the infantry.

1115
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:41,783
Ain't nobody tougher than
my sergeant. He's tough.

1116
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:44,221
I sure am.

1117
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:45,917
Oh, sergeant.

1118
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:47,994
I'm a louse.

1119
01:12:48,163 --> 01:12:50,188
I don't know, sergeant.

1120
01:12:50,365 --> 01:12:54,825
You seem to be a
pretty decent Joe to me.

1121
01:12:55,404 --> 01:12:59,067
-You take that back.
-All right.

1122
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:00,799
I'll just bet you five bucks...

1123
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:03,911
...I'm a bigger louse than
you and I'm just a private.

1124
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:07,606
-Yeah? Put up or shut up.
-Yeah, put up or shut up.

1125
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:11,082
What's a bigger louse than a
louse that'll drink your booze...

1126
01:13:11,253 --> 01:13:13,244
...and then punch
you right in the guts?

1127
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:16,983
-Put up or shut up.
-Oh, says who?

1128
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,491
Sergeant, I think we ought
to be going on back now.

1129
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,720
Go away, you're drunk.

1130
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:25,626
Oh-ho.

1131
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,826
Come on,
infantry, let's get the fly boys.

1132
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:29,595
Oh....

1133
01:13:36,144 --> 01:13:37,771
Oh!

1134
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:45,579
I done hit him once, Irving,
ain't no use to overdoing it.

1135
01:13:52,327 --> 01:13:54,852
Now, you see, you
antagonized him, sergeant.

1136
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,089
I think we ought to be
going on home, anyhow.

1137
01:13:57,265 --> 01:13:59,597
All right, just a minute.

1138
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:10,945
I know you're having
a whole lot of fun...

1139
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:13,081
...so I won't stay around
and be a wet blanket.

1140
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:16,742
Okay, I'm going on
back to the barracks.

1141
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:21,419
Hush a minute, hush a minute. I'm
gonna go on back and give Ben a hand.

1142
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:50,718
-Is this the Purple Grotto?
-Right up yonder.

1143
01:14:56,491 --> 01:14:59,051
Couple of thirsty
fellas for you.

1144
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:17,443
-Ain't the sergeant showed up yet?
-Nope.

1145
01:15:17,612 --> 01:15:21,104
-Why didn't you come to breakfast?
-Went over to carpenter shop.

1146
01:15:21,283 --> 01:15:23,808
-What're you doing there?
-Fixing up something special.

1147
01:15:23,985 --> 01:15:26,215
It ain't everyday a
colonel comes to inspect.

1148
01:15:26,388 --> 01:15:28,322
I sure wish the
sergeant was here.

1149
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:31,687
Like I told you, he was having a
whole lot of fun. But he'll show up.

1150
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:35,125
Sergeant King, he ain't gonna
miss no inspection if he can help it.

1151
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:37,358
The heck he ain't.

1152
01:15:37,532 --> 01:15:40,831
Here comes the captain
now. And the colonel.

1153
01:15:41,002 --> 01:15:44,563
-Going round front.
-Oh, golly.

1154
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:48,202
-Who's gonna report?
-Hey, you're in charge.

1155
01:15:48,376 --> 01:15:50,469
-Me?
-Yeah.

1156
01:15:51,379 --> 01:15:53,847
Barracks ready
for inspection, sir.

1157
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,309
-Barracks ready for inspection, sir.
-Here.

1158
01:15:56,485 --> 01:16:00,353
Listen, when you throw open this door,
holler "Attention," just as loud as you can.

1159
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:02,149
Okay? Okay. Okay.

1160
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:10,991
Barracks ready
for inspection, sir.

1161
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:14,360
Where's Sergeant King?

1162
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:17,505
I don't know, sir, but the
barracks are ready for inspection.

1163
01:16:17,672 --> 01:16:19,572
All right, all right.

1164
01:16:20,442 --> 01:16:23,377
Just for a starter, I'd like you
to take a look at this latrine.

1165
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:26,810
There's a man in this barracks
whose latrine work is quite surprising.

1166
01:16:27,582 --> 01:16:32,019
Attention!

1167
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:37,585
Latrine ready
for inspection, sir.

1168
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:56,039
Latrine ready
for inspection, sir.

1169
01:17:00,615 --> 01:17:03,175
What is the idea behind this?

1170
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:07,386
Welcoming the colonel, sir.

1171
01:17:09,958 --> 01:17:11,391
I'm sorry, sir.

1172
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:16,361
Oh, that's all right, captain. I've
been welcomed in many ways.

1173
01:17:16,531 --> 01:17:19,762
Ticker tape, flags waving.

1174
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:23,496
Women of a French village
once three rose buds at me.

1175
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:25,606
But this....

1176
01:17:26,741 --> 01:17:28,766
This is just....

1177
01:17:29,611 --> 01:17:32,045
Well, I don't know.

1178
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:45,355
They didn't hardly
inspect the latrine at all.

1179
01:17:45,527 --> 01:17:47,222
I don't know, Will.

1180
01:17:47,395 --> 01:17:48,885
They--

1181
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:51,523
They, oh....

1182
01:18:20,462 --> 01:18:22,327
Sergeant.

1183
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:25,428
Lieutenant back there
almost spotted me.

1184
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,431
-You all right?
-I ain't sure.

1185
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:29,763
-Hey, where's Irving?
-MP's got him.

1186
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:32,236
-Golly. COLONEL:
Very nice, captain.

1187
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:33,738
Thank you, sir.

1188
01:18:33,909 --> 01:18:35,274
-The colonel?
-Yeah.

1189
01:18:35,443 --> 01:18:38,412
Hey, they inspected
in here already.

1190
01:18:38,613 --> 01:18:39,637
Hey...

1191
01:18:39,814 --> 01:18:42,078
...watch out for that treadle.

1192
01:18:44,853 --> 01:18:46,912
Very good, indeed.

1193
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:55,589
Mm-hm. Excellent. Excellent. Were you
in charge during your sergeant's absence?

1194
01:18:55,764 --> 01:18:57,231
Yes, sir. Complete charge.

1195
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,663
I think you should make
a note of this man's name.

1196
01:18:59,834 --> 01:19:00,858
Yes, indeed, sir.

1197
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,765
-What is it, private?
-Whitledge, sir.

1198
01:19:13,381 --> 01:19:14,507
Whitledge, sir.

1199
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:16,981
-What's that again, private?
-Whitledge, sir.

1200
01:19:17,152 --> 01:19:22,852
W-H-l-T-L-E-D-G-E.

1201
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:28,658
-What the devil is--?
-What's going on in there?

1202
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,697
Latrine's out of order, sir.

1203
01:19:31,866 --> 01:19:34,300
You're gonna have to
use the one next door.

1204
01:19:34,469 --> 01:19:36,266
Let me in there.

1205
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,676
This is the barracks
sergeant, sir.

1206
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:50,682
How are you, sir?

1207
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:53,980
All slicked up for
inspection. Explain.

1208
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:57,985
Explain.

1209
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:00,524
Well, sir...

1210
01:20:01,629 --> 01:20:04,427
...I went to a
movie last night, sir.

1211
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:08,091
And there were these eight
infantry men sitting right in behind me.

1212
01:20:08,269 --> 01:20:10,635
And they was cussing
out the Air Force...

1213
01:20:10,805 --> 01:20:16,072
...and saying as how that their officers
were more understanding than our officers.

1214
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:22,205
-So you fought them all night long?
-Yes, sir, it was awful.

1215
01:20:22,751 --> 01:20:24,742
What was the name of the movie?

1216
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:26,512
-Movie?
-The movie.

1217
01:20:26,688 --> 01:20:28,155
Oh.

1218
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:31,749
Forward March.

1219
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:34,759
American Battalion.

1220
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:36,861
Out of the Air.

1221
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:40,801
Up in the Wild Blue?

1222
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:44,198
It was a sneak preview.

1223
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:48,470
Captain, I don't know how
this man ever got on my base...

1224
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:50,770
...but he's certainly not
going to remain here.

1225
01:20:50,945 --> 01:20:54,938
Corrupting new airmen with this
horrible example. Ship him out.

1226
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:57,380
There's a group leaving
for gunnery school today.

1227
01:20:57,552 --> 01:21:00,680
Splendid. General Bush can
always use another private.

1228
01:21:00,855 --> 01:21:02,413
Private?

1229
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:06,360
Private.

1230
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:09,321
Private.

1231
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:13,125
That name
was Whitledge, sir.

1232
01:21:13,301 --> 01:21:15,166
W-H-l-T-L--

1233
01:21:15,336 --> 01:21:16,667
-Whitledge, eh?
-Yes, sir.

1234
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:21,502
This is going on your record, Whitledge.
This is going on everybody's record.

1235
01:21:26,815 --> 01:21:30,216
Something special
for the colonel.

1236
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:36,282
You ain't a sergeant no more.

1237
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:39,222
No, I ain't a sergeant
no more. I'm a private.

1238
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:42,830
A 45-year-old private.

1239
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:44,460
Gosh.

1240
01:21:44,632 --> 01:21:47,965
-He's putting it on my record.
-Gosh, Ben--

1241
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:52,129
There's one silver lining to
this cloud, though, by George.

1242
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:56,073
You're staying here, but
I'm going to gunnery school...

1243
01:21:56,244 --> 01:21:58,838
...a thousand miles away.

1244
01:21:59,013 --> 01:22:00,503
- Sergeant?
- Private.

1245
01:22:00,682 --> 01:22:02,081
I ain't staying here.

1246
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:05,117
I'm going to gunnery
school like you are.

1247
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:07,484
They took you?

1248
01:22:07,922 --> 01:22:09,048
You passed the eye test?

1249
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:12,082
It's on the bulletin board.

1250
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,751
It was your helping
done it for me.

1251
01:22:14,929 --> 01:22:19,263
-Oh, no, no, no.
-We're gonna be together.

1252
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:22,134
I've had about all I can take.

1253
01:22:22,303 --> 01:22:25,363
You and him be together,
just leave me out of it.

1254
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,371
-But we're buddies.
-Buddies?

1255
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:30,010
Last night you said
you was proud of me.

1256
01:22:30,178 --> 01:22:32,237
I was drunk. I didn't
know what I was saying.

1257
01:22:32,413 --> 01:22:35,644
-You give me your watch.
-I was drunk.

1258
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:39,943
Not when you put me
in charge of the latrine.

1259
01:22:41,055 --> 01:22:45,321
You talk to him. Maybe
you can get through.

1260
01:22:47,795 --> 01:22:50,559
Cleaning the latrine
isn't a good job, Will.

1261
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:52,859
It's the worst job there is.

1262
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:54,524
It's a punishment job.

1263
01:22:56,437 --> 01:22:57,495
It is.

1264
01:22:57,672 --> 01:23:00,300
Now do you understand?
There's your buddy.

1265
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:03,501
Make trouble for
him for a change.

1266
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:14,952
Great.

1267
01:23:15,123 --> 01:23:19,253
You thought you were gonna miss
him, so you tore up your transfer.

1268
01:23:19,427 --> 01:23:22,487
Well, you don't look
so glad about it now.

1269
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:30,027
You tore up your transfer, Ben?

1270
01:23:32,073 --> 01:23:33,938
It was just an
application, that's all.

1271
01:23:34,909 --> 01:23:37,173
To the infantry.

1272
01:23:37,345 --> 01:23:39,245
It doesn't make
any difference now.

1273
01:23:39,414 --> 01:23:42,110
After this, I couldn't get
transferred to a troop of mules.

1274
01:23:42,283 --> 01:23:43,648
I didn't know you done that.

1275
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:46,719
-Just forget about it, will you?
-You ain't sore at me?

1276
01:23:46,888 --> 01:23:49,448
I ain't jumping up and
down, you can say that again.

1277
01:23:49,624 --> 01:23:51,683
You ain't nothing but
trouble since we met...

1278
01:23:51,859 --> 01:23:54,259
...running around acting
like a big, dang donkey.

1279
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:57,064
I'll make it up to you,
Ben, honest I will.

1280
01:23:57,665 --> 01:24:00,759
Just forget about it, will
you? Don't try to do nothing.

1281
01:24:00,935 --> 01:24:03,995
Oh, we'll still speak because
we'll be in the same outfit...

1282
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:05,696
...and that's the
military way...

1283
01:24:05,873 --> 01:24:08,171
...but forget about it.
We'll both be better off.

1284
01:24:09,677 --> 01:24:13,807
-Ben, please--
-Gotta go pack for gunnery school.

1285
01:24:18,620 --> 01:24:19,746
Oh, yeah.

1286
01:24:19,921 --> 01:24:24,449
Well, Ben, Sergeant King and me,
we all went to gunnery school together.

1287
01:24:24,626 --> 01:24:26,355
Like The Three Musketeers.

1288
01:24:26,527 --> 01:24:29,724
And they put us on this here
squadron on this here air base?

1289
01:24:29,897 --> 01:24:32,195
And it was way out in
the middle of the country.

1290
01:24:32,367 --> 01:24:34,494
You know, out of the
way of the other outfits.

1291
01:24:34,669 --> 01:24:37,638
And the planes is
what they call obsolete...

1292
01:24:37,805 --> 01:24:42,208
...and the officer crews that run them,
well, they wasn't kept up very much either.

1293
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:45,938
I guess it's what you might call
a second-line-of-defense outfit.

1294
01:24:46,114 --> 01:24:49,174
But, anyhow, Ben and me was
put on the same flight crew...

1295
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:52,581
...because they put you according
to how you come in your class...

1296
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:55,450
...and we was the bottom two.

1297
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:58,319
Sergeant King though,
he came out on top.

1298
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:01,929
He did. The instructor said
they never seen nothing like it.

1299
01:25:02,096 --> 01:25:05,293
It was just as if he had copies
of the test before they gave them.

1300
01:25:07,268 --> 01:25:11,329
All right, boys, get this one off
and you can all get back to sleep.

1301
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:21,510
Hey, look at you with an arm band
and a writing pad and everything.

1302
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:25,119
All right, get on the plane.
You're taking off right now.

1303
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:27,413
Hey, we can't.
Everybody ain't here yet.

1304
01:25:27,588 --> 01:25:30,455
The radio operator and the
front gunner, they ain't showed up.

1305
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:33,059
All right. Get onboard
the plane. Get moving.

1306
01:25:33,227 --> 01:25:34,717
Clear.

1307
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:42,201
How come we're going
up so early, sergeant?

1308
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:44,634
To break the sound barrier.

1309
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:47,502
You gotta sneak up on
it when nobody's looking.

1310
01:25:47,842 --> 01:25:49,503
Oh.

1311
01:26:01,089 --> 01:26:03,421
Excuse me, sir.

1312
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:10,388
-Excuse me, sirs. Howdy.
-What the--?

1313
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:13,227
It's all right, George.
He's one of the crew.

1314
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:14,959
Okay, okay.

1315
01:26:15,136 --> 01:26:17,536
Don't come sneaking up
on people like that, fella.

1316
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:21,664
Sorry, sir. I just wanted to
see what you all do up here.

1317
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:24,107
It's on automatic pilot.

1318
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:28,708
-Did you already let up the wheels?
-Heck, yes.

1319
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:29,907
Shucks.

1320
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:33,986
-What are you all do in back, anyhow?
-Nothing much.

1321
01:26:34,155 --> 01:26:37,647
I mostly look out the
blister and sweep up a little.

1322
01:26:40,194 --> 01:26:41,821
Good night.

1323
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:47,798
Excuse me, sir.

1324
01:26:54,575 --> 01:26:57,806
Take an awful long time
to get to Denver, Colorado.

1325
01:26:57,979 --> 01:26:59,310
What they doing up there?

1326
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:03,507
Oh, you'd be right proud of them,
Ben. They're working real hard.

1327
01:27:03,684 --> 01:27:06,346
Steering and navigating
and engineering and all.

1328
01:27:08,489 --> 01:27:11,185
Navigator to pilot.
Navigator to pilot, over.

1329
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:12,917
Pilot to navigator.

1330
01:27:13,094 --> 01:27:15,858
Fred, I wish you wouldn't call
me once we're off the ground.

1331
01:27:16,030 --> 01:27:18,590
We're over the Gulf
of Mexico, you idiot.

1332
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:21,765
How can we be over
the Gulf of Mexico...

1333
01:27:21,936 --> 01:27:24,598
...when there's a city below
us half the size of New York?

1334
01:27:24,772 --> 01:27:26,763
You wanna come back
here and check the maps?

1335
01:27:26,941 --> 01:27:28,909
I figured our position
by dead reckoning...

1336
01:27:29,076 --> 01:27:32,204
...and we're smack-dab in the
middle of the Gulf of Mexico.

1337
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:35,349
Hey, fellas, Number
2 engine is dead.

1338
01:27:36,284 --> 01:27:37,410
Okay.

1339
01:27:40,988 --> 01:27:44,185
-Prepare for landing.
-This is not a seaplane.

1340
01:27:44,358 --> 01:27:47,191
Copilot to rear gunner.
Copilot to rear gunner. Over.

1341
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:57,236
Howdy.

1342
01:27:57,405 --> 01:28:00,670
Have you seen anything below
that might have been a body of water?

1343
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:04,471
No, sir, I ain't seen
nothing. I been sweeping up.

1344
01:28:04,645 --> 01:28:07,842
What is the matter with that radio
operator? Pilot to radio operator.

1345
01:28:08,015 --> 01:28:11,712
-Pilot to radio operator. Over.
-Copilot to radio operator. Over.

1346
01:28:11,886 --> 01:28:16,619
-Navigator to radio operator. Over?
-Rear gunner to everybody.

1347
01:28:16,791 --> 01:28:18,986
Radio operator missed the plane.

1348
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:20,655
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.

1349
01:28:21,395 --> 01:28:23,022
-Over.
-Listen, rear gunner...

1350
01:28:23,197 --> 01:28:25,358
...you ought to know
how to operate that radio.

1351
01:28:25,533 --> 01:28:28,559
See if you can find out where
we are. This is an emergency.

1352
01:28:28,736 --> 01:28:31,899
We know exactly where we are.

1353
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:34,633
Hey, sir, you ought to give
the job to the other gunner.

1354
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:37,972
I reckon he'd be about the best
dang radio operator there is...

1355
01:28:38,145 --> 01:28:40,204
...in the whole
danged Air Force.

1356
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:44,545
All right, just put somebody on
that lousy radio! Over and out!

1357
01:28:44,719 --> 01:28:48,155
Hey, hey, hey, Ben. Hey,
listen. Hey, hey, wake up, Ben.

1358
01:28:48,322 --> 01:28:50,483
-What?
-Listen, it's an emergency.

1359
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:54,389
We're lost and Lieutenant Bridges
wants you to be the radio operator...

1360
01:28:54,562 --> 01:28:56,291
...and find out where we are.

1361
01:28:56,464 --> 01:29:00,764
It's your big chance, Ben, to save
the plane and us and everything.

1362
01:29:00,935 --> 01:29:03,426
-Me?
-They heard what a good soldier you was.

1363
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:06,539
Golly. Oh, Lord.

1364
01:29:10,711 --> 01:29:14,340
-Hey, here's some instructions.
-Good. Read them off.

1365
01:29:14,515 --> 01:29:17,006
I'll operate and
you be my assistant.

1366
01:29:17,184 --> 01:29:18,845
Assistant?

1367
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:22,456
Yes, sir. Heh-heh.

1368
01:29:22,757 --> 01:29:25,282
Um.... "Important notice.

1369
01:29:25,459 --> 01:29:29,486
The taxpayers of the
United States paid their--"

1370
01:29:29,664 --> 01:29:34,033
-Here. You operate, I'll read.
-Oh, but they gave the job to you, Ben.

1371
01:29:34,201 --> 01:29:37,659
Go on. I gotta think
for the good of the outfit.

1372
01:29:37,838 --> 01:29:41,330
"Two. Turn oscillator
control knob--"

1373
01:29:41,509 --> 01:29:43,340
I think that's the
big one there.

1374
01:29:43,511 --> 01:29:46,878
"--to transmission
frequency desired."

1375
01:29:48,482 --> 01:29:50,677
Well, what frequency
do we desire?

1376
01:29:50,851 --> 01:29:53,513
Well, I'll leave that up to you.

1377
01:29:53,688 --> 01:29:56,851
Alrighty.

1378
01:29:57,024 --> 01:29:59,925
"Adjust Knob B...

1379
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:04,360
...so as to obtain
minimum impedance."

1380
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:09,931
Hey, listen, Ben. We got a
little old radio on the porch...

1381
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:12,664
...whenever it won't work,
Pa spits in the back of it...

1382
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:16,241
...and whomps it a good and
it works every time. Let's see.

1383
01:30:24,051 --> 01:30:26,246
There you are, she's a-working.

1384
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:28,888
-She's a-working.
-We done it, Will.

1385
01:30:29,056 --> 01:30:30,990
Hello?

1386
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:34,857
Hello?

1387
01:30:35,029 --> 01:30:38,362
There. Ha-ha. I told
you I'd find an airport.

1388
01:30:41,535 --> 01:30:44,026
That's a drive-in
movie. Pull up.

1389
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:46,673
Pull up. Pull up.

1390
01:30:54,582 --> 01:30:56,607
Hello?

1391
01:30:56,784 --> 01:30:59,218
If you get somebody,
be careful what you say.

1392
01:30:59,387 --> 01:31:02,754
-It might be the enemy.
-What enemy?

1393
01:31:02,923 --> 01:31:07,223
-I don't know, but be careful.
-Okay.

1394
01:31:07,395 --> 01:31:09,363
Hello?

1395
01:31:11,732 --> 01:31:13,165
Hello?

1396
01:31:16,771 --> 01:31:18,636
- Sergeant.
- I'm clear on one.

1397
01:31:18,806 --> 01:31:20,034
Door.

1398
01:31:21,409 --> 01:31:25,402
Excuse me, sir, but I'm getting
a very odd signal here. Listen.

1399
01:31:25,579 --> 01:31:28,673
in 5930, chap. Over.

1400
01:31:28,849 --> 01:31:30,612
That is odd.

1401
01:31:30,785 --> 01:31:32,514
Sounds like somebody spitting.

1402
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:36,054
Okay, Will, try it
again. - Yes, sir.

1403
01:31:36,223 --> 01:31:38,555
Hello?

1404
01:31:38,726 --> 01:31:40,921
Hello?

1405
01:31:41,095 --> 01:31:43,461
Anybody there?

1406
01:31:43,631 --> 01:31:46,498
-Hello?
-Hello.

1407
01:31:46,667 --> 01:31:49,158
-Hello.
-Hello?

1408
01:31:49,336 --> 01:31:51,395
Howdy.

1409
01:31:51,572 --> 01:31:55,235
- Hey, Ben, I got somebody.
- How about that?

1410
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:57,536
Who are you? Where are you?

1411
01:31:57,712 --> 01:31:59,646
Ben, he wants
to know who we are.

1412
01:31:59,814 --> 01:32:02,282
Answer me. Who
the devil are you?

1413
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:05,385
He talks like an American, Ben.

1414
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,611
Ben says, "First, who are you?"

1415
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:11,349
This is command post
Operation Prometheus.

1416
01:32:11,525 --> 01:32:14,153
-Are you in an airplane?
-Sure are.

1417
01:32:14,328 --> 01:32:17,820
-Oh, great Scott.
-No, sir. Stockdale.

1418
01:32:17,998 --> 01:32:19,989
That must be this
pip on the scope, sir.

1419
01:32:20,167 --> 01:32:22,829
-Heading straight towards the tower, sir.
-Judas priest.

1420
01:32:23,003 --> 01:32:26,063
-Is this the Gulf of Mexico?
-No, you idiot.

1421
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,869
-Send word to stop the detonator.
-It's too late, sir. Zero-minus-4.

1422
01:32:30,044 --> 01:32:32,069
Hey, where'd you say we was?

1423
01:32:32,246 --> 01:32:35,238
You're right over Yucca Flats,
Nevada. The atomic proving ground.

1424
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:37,976
Listen to me. I want you
to turn that plane around...

1425
01:32:38,152 --> 01:32:40,120
...and head right back
where you came from.

1426
01:32:40,287 --> 01:32:42,346
There they are.
Straight toward the tower.

1427
01:32:42,523 --> 01:32:45,856
Ben says, "Sorry. Our orders
come from General Bush.

1428
01:32:46,026 --> 01:32:47,425
We got to do like he says. "

1429
01:32:47,595 --> 01:32:51,463
-Eugene Bush?
-Our commanding general.

1430
01:32:51,632 --> 01:32:54,624
-Fat fellow with a mustache.
-I might've known.

1431
01:32:54,802 --> 01:32:56,565
Get me through to General Bush.

1432
01:32:56,737 --> 01:32:58,534
That idiot, I'll
kill him for this.

1433
01:32:58,706 --> 01:33:00,901
Get me General Bush,
12th Air Group. Emergency.

1434
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:03,976
All right. I don't care what Ben
says or what Eugene Bush said.

1435
01:33:04,145 --> 01:33:06,613
I'm a general too, in
the U.S. Army infantry.

1436
01:33:06,781 --> 01:33:08,078
The infantry?

1437
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:11,184
Yes, and I'm ordering you to
turn that plane around this minute.

1438
01:33:11,352 --> 01:33:12,649
You're heading straight into--

1439
01:33:16,223 --> 01:33:18,783
Hello? Hello?

1440
01:33:18,959 --> 01:33:22,395
-Great Scott, I've lost them.
-He's right here, sir.

1441
01:33:24,932 --> 01:33:26,024
Bush here.

1442
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,532
Eugene, this is Vernon Pollard.

1443
01:33:29,136 --> 01:33:33,800
Vernon. Well, how
are you, old boy?

1444
01:33:33,974 --> 01:33:36,067
You've sabotaged
my operation, you idiot.

1445
01:33:36,243 --> 01:33:39,508
You were ordered to send your plane
far away and one is coming over us.

1446
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:41,875
I sent them away, Vernon.

1447
01:33:42,049 --> 01:33:45,075
-I sent them to Denver.
-I don't care where you sent them.

1448
01:33:45,252 --> 01:33:47,812
-What's wrong with your communications?
-What's wrong...

1449
01:33:47,988 --> 01:33:50,548
...with your security
measures, old boy?

1450
01:33:50,724 --> 01:33:51,748
Shut up and listen.

1451
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:53,826
I'm trying to reestablish
radio contact.

1452
01:33:53,994 --> 01:33:56,588
What kind of idiot radio
operators do you put in planes?

1453
01:33:56,764 --> 01:34:00,996
What kind of idiot radio operators
did you put in those planes?

1454
01:34:01,168 --> 01:34:02,465
I'll skin you for this, Eugene.

1455
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:05,761
Sir, I've got that signal again.

1456
01:34:08,809 --> 01:34:10,868
Hello? MAN:
Twenty-three, stand by.

1457
01:34:11,045 --> 01:34:13,707
Hello?

1458
01:34:13,881 --> 01:34:17,749
Hello, listen, here's
your General Bush.

1459
01:34:17,918 --> 01:34:20,011
They got General
Bush there, Ben.

1460
01:34:20,187 --> 01:34:22,815
Eugene, I'm putting the
telephone next to the microphone.

1461
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:24,423
Tell this idiot to turn back.

1462
01:34:24,592 --> 01:34:27,425
Hello? Who is this?

1463
01:34:27,595 --> 01:34:30,894
-Private Stockdale, sir.
-This is General Bush, Stockdale.

1464
01:34:31,065 --> 01:34:34,057
-Stockdale?
-Don't move, King.

1465
01:34:34,235 --> 01:34:36,567
Tell your pilot to reverse
course immediately.

1466
01:34:36,737 --> 01:34:40,969
-You're in extreme danger.
-Roger, sir. Wilco.

1467
01:34:41,141 --> 01:34:43,974
Ben says, "How do we
know you are General Bush?"

1468
01:34:44,144 --> 01:34:46,374
Tell him Sergeant King
will give him his watch.

1469
01:34:46,547 --> 01:34:49,641
-What? Huh?
-It's the only way, sir.

1470
01:34:49,817 --> 01:34:52,217
Sergeant King
will give his watch.

1471
01:34:52,386 --> 01:34:55,549
-He will?
-I think so.

1472
01:34:55,723 --> 01:34:58,886
That's good enough for me.
I'll go tell Lieutenant Bridges.

1473
01:34:59,059 --> 01:35:01,619
I'll tell him this personal.

1474
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:09,228
Excuse me, lieutenant, but
we talked with General Bush...

1475
01:35:09,403 --> 01:35:11,166
...and he says
we're in real danger...

1476
01:35:11,338 --> 01:35:13,602
...and you should reverse
course quick as a wink.

1477
01:35:13,774 --> 01:35:17,073
-Danger? Where are we?
-Smack-dab over Yucca Flats, Nevada.

1478
01:35:17,244 --> 01:35:19,235
Holy Pete.

1479
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:23,708
Hey, I just wanted to tell you
what a good job Ben done.

1480
01:35:23,884 --> 01:35:26,580
Maybe you could recommend
him for a promotion or something.

1481
01:35:26,754 --> 01:35:29,120
-Shut up. Don't bother me.
-But, lieutenant...

1482
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:31,485
...maybe you could get
him a medal or something.

1483
01:35:31,659 --> 01:35:34,093
Get back to your
station! Don't bother me!

1484
01:35:34,261 --> 01:35:37,594
Don't bother me again for
anything! That's an order!

1485
01:35:40,301 --> 01:35:41,996
Yes, sir.

1486
01:35:43,370 --> 01:35:44,837
Twenty seconds, sir.

1487
01:35:45,005 --> 01:35:46,939
It's working, sir.
They're turning.

1488
01:35:47,107 --> 01:35:49,200
You did it, Eugene.
They're turning.

1489
01:35:49,376 --> 01:35:51,310
There they go.
They're still turning.

1490
01:35:51,478 --> 01:35:54,003
No. They're heading
for the tower again.

1491
01:35:54,181 --> 01:35:56,274
Ten seconds, sir.

1492
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:58,350
It's all your fault, Eugene.

1493
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:01,511
You've never forgiven me for
those hazings back at the point.

1494
01:36:02,456 --> 01:36:04,890
It's all your fault,
you blundering idiot.

1495
01:36:05,059 --> 01:36:07,721
For 30 years you've been out to
get me. - Five, four--

1496
01:36:07,895 --> 01:36:12,958
-And now you're out to wreck my career.
--three, two, one, zero.

1497
01:36:20,774 --> 01:36:23,834
What happened? What happened?

1498
01:36:24,678 --> 01:36:27,476
-Look, we're on fire!
-We got to jump out!

1499
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,945
I got to tell them up front!

1500
01:36:29,116 --> 01:36:32,017
No, they said they didn't want
to be bothered about anything...

1501
01:36:32,186 --> 01:36:34,518
-...no matter what!
-But we can't leave like that!

1502
01:36:34,688 --> 01:36:36,952
-They said it was an order, Ben!
-No, Will!

1503
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:39,319
Hang on!

1504
01:36:48,268 --> 01:36:49,758
Pull to the left!

1505
01:36:49,937 --> 01:36:53,338
No, pull to the right!

1506
01:36:53,507 --> 01:36:55,532
Hold still, Ben.

1507
01:36:55,709 --> 01:36:57,233
What'd you do it for?

1508
01:36:57,411 --> 01:37:00,312
You snatched me right out of
the plane! What'd you do it for?

1509
01:37:00,481 --> 01:37:03,917
Well, I know you didn't have
time to put on your parachute.

1510
01:37:04,084 --> 01:37:06,177
And heck, you'd have
done the same for me.

1511
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:07,377
No, I wouldn't.

1512
01:37:07,554 --> 01:37:11,354
Our post was the tail of the
plane and nobody told us to quit it.

1513
01:37:11,525 --> 01:37:14,494
But the tail was on fire, Ben.

1514
01:37:14,661 --> 01:37:16,822
Our post was a-quitting us.

1515
01:37:16,997 --> 01:37:19,124
Do you know what we are now?

1516
01:37:19,299 --> 01:37:21,699
-Well, we're alive.
-We're deserters.

1517
01:37:21,869 --> 01:37:24,167
Deserters!

1518
01:37:24,338 --> 01:37:27,432
Quit wiggling, Ben. Please.

1519
01:37:27,608 --> 01:37:31,840
The first lick of danger and
you snatch me away from it.

1520
01:37:32,012 --> 01:37:35,846
I'd rather be a dead
hero than a live deserter.

1521
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:39,577
I ain't gonna drop you
no matter what you say.

1522
01:37:45,225 --> 01:37:47,693
Hey, we can slip through
here and nobody'll see us.

1523
01:37:47,861 --> 01:37:51,695
We're in for it and we ought to report
back through the gate. That's military.

1524
01:37:51,865 --> 01:37:54,561
Yeah, and have them grab us
before we get to the general?

1525
01:37:54,735 --> 01:37:58,398
No, by dog, we'll report to General
Bush's office and explain to him in person.

1526
01:37:58,572 --> 01:38:00,506
It'll be all right,
Ben, you'll see.

1527
01:38:01,508 --> 01:38:04,568
Everything seems happy. Sounds
like they're having a band concert.

1528
01:38:04,745 --> 01:38:06,042
Oh, Will.

1529
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:08,909
It'll be all right, Ben, they'll
give us some new uniforms.

1530
01:38:09,083 --> 01:38:10,550
Yeah, with numbers on the back.

1531
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:14,349
Let's see. Bush's office
is on the other side.

1532
01:38:14,521 --> 01:38:18,981
We'll just slip along cautious-like
and keep cover along the buildings.

1533
01:38:29,903 --> 01:38:33,236
How about that? It's
some kind of real big ceremony.

1534
01:38:33,407 --> 01:38:35,967
Look, the
flag, it's at half-mast.

1535
01:38:36,143 --> 01:38:38,771
It's a funeral ceremony,
that's what it is.

1536
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:42,575
Lieutenant Brides and them
others, they didn't get out of the plane.

1537
01:38:42,749 --> 01:38:44,478
Now we got that
on our heads too.

1538
01:38:44,651 --> 01:38:50,180
Oh, now, Ben, they wasn't so easygoing
they wouldn't know they was on fire.

1539
01:38:50,357 --> 01:38:52,689
We'll find out when
we report to the general.

1540
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:56,990
-Everything'll come out real dandy.
-Yeah, sure.

1541
01:38:59,466 --> 01:39:03,197
Ten days ago, in
Operation Prometheus...

1542
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:06,168
...the power of the atom
bomb was challenged...

1543
01:39:06,340 --> 01:39:09,400
...by a band of
battle-hardened air aces.

1544
01:39:09,576 --> 01:39:13,137
Well, brush, man, brush.
That's genuine leather.

1545
01:39:13,313 --> 01:39:16,407
-Here, watch that sleeve.
-The grandstands are full, sir.

1546
01:39:16,583 --> 01:39:18,210
You're darned right they are.

1547
01:39:18,385 --> 01:39:21,081
Those men are on duty. All
leaves were canceled today.

1548
01:39:21,255 --> 01:39:24,486
Senator Hawk and Senator Winkle
have come out of the reviewing stand.

1549
01:39:24,658 --> 01:39:27,650
-Good. Good. My car here, Baker?
-I'm certain it is. I'll check.

1550
01:39:27,828 --> 01:39:31,559
Abel, check and see if those idiot
officers are on hand to be decorated.

1551
01:39:31,732 --> 01:39:33,222
Yes, sir.

1552
01:39:38,205 --> 01:39:41,572
Two did not return.

1553
01:39:41,742 --> 01:39:45,200
Two did not return.

1554
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:49,013
In the shattered
tail of the plane...

1555
01:39:49,183 --> 01:39:53,882
...all that remained were
two charred flight helmets...

1556
01:39:54,054 --> 01:39:57,455
...and a handful of dust.

1557
01:39:59,026 --> 01:40:00,721
Excuse me, sir, l--

1558
01:40:01,695 --> 01:40:04,391
What the devil are
you men doing here?

1559
01:40:04,831 --> 01:40:07,061
Well, you see, sir, we come to--

1560
01:40:07,234 --> 01:40:09,964
Your uniform is filthy, boy.

1561
01:40:10,137 --> 01:40:13,538
I know, sir. We hitchhiked some,
but we had to walk a lot and--

1562
01:40:13,707 --> 01:40:15,902
People are coming
from miles around.

1563
01:40:16,076 --> 01:40:20,274
Generals, senators to do
homage to two enlisted men.

1564
01:40:20,447 --> 01:40:22,312
Your brothers-in-arms.

1565
01:40:22,482 --> 01:40:25,076
And you don't even have
enough courtesy and respect...

1566
01:40:25,252 --> 01:40:27,117
...to put on a decent uniform.

1567
01:40:27,287 --> 01:40:30,450
-Sir, please, I'd like to turn myself in.
-He didn't jump, sir.

1568
01:40:30,624 --> 01:40:31,921
I pulled him out.

1569
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,860
The car is ready, sir.

1570
01:40:35,128 --> 01:40:37,289
What squadron are you men in?

1571
01:40:37,464 --> 01:40:40,058
-The ninth squadron, sir.
-The ninth?

1572
01:40:40,234 --> 01:40:42,896
Stackpole and
Whitehead's own outfit.

1573
01:40:43,070 --> 01:40:46,062
-Stockdale and Whitledge, sir.
-Stockdale and Whitledge, sir.

1574
01:40:46,974 --> 01:40:49,499
Well, whoever they were.

1575
01:40:49,676 --> 01:40:52,611
Now, you two are going right
back into that conference room...

1576
01:40:52,779 --> 01:40:54,838
...until I finish this ceremony.

1577
01:40:55,015 --> 01:40:58,348
And then we'll see if we
can put a little decency...

1578
01:40:58,518 --> 01:41:01,919
...and esprit de corps into you.

1579
01:41:02,089 --> 01:41:06,583
Dirty uniforms.
Today of all days.

1580
01:41:06,793 --> 01:41:09,421
Well, you men heard
the orders. Get in there.

1581
01:41:14,001 --> 01:41:17,300
Well, we turned
ourselves in, I think.

1582
01:41:17,471 --> 01:41:21,339
Yeah, wait until he finds out that besides
wearing dirty uniforms, we're deserters.

1583
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,560
Ah-ah.

1584
01:41:47,734 --> 01:41:48,758
What's the matter?

1585
01:41:48,935 --> 01:41:51,062
Lieutenant Bridges
on the back cover.

1586
01:41:52,105 --> 01:41:55,199
I wished you would look.

1587
01:41:57,377 --> 01:42:00,744
General Bush has just
taken his place on the reviewing stand...

1588
01:42:00,914 --> 01:42:03,781
...and now the four lieutenants
who braved the atomic blast...

1589
01:42:03,950 --> 01:42:07,317
...and will receive the Air Medal,
are bravely mounting the platform.

1590
01:42:07,487 --> 01:42:11,753
The lieutenants. They're alive.
They're getting medals. They're heroes.

1591
01:42:11,925 --> 01:42:12,949
Golly.

1592
01:42:13,126 --> 01:42:15,458
If we'd have stayed on,
we'd have been heroes.

1593
01:42:15,629 --> 01:42:17,824
It is a solemn moment,
ladies and gentlemen.

1594
01:42:17,998 --> 01:42:20,762
The many visiting dignitaries
standing at attention...

1595
01:42:20,934 --> 01:42:23,994
...the flag at half-mast
in honor of the two men...

1596
01:42:24,171 --> 01:42:27,334
...who gave their lives in
Operation Prometheus...

1597
01:42:27,507 --> 01:42:29,941
...Privates Stockdale
and Whitledge.

1598
01:42:32,045 --> 01:42:34,377
-Stockdale and Whitledge?
-Stockdale and Whitledge?

1599
01:42:34,548 --> 01:42:37,381
Yes, Stockdale and Whitledge.

1600
01:42:37,551 --> 01:42:41,351
Names that will live
as long as men are free.

1601
01:42:41,521 --> 01:42:44,081
We are heroes, Ben.

1602
01:42:44,257 --> 01:42:45,622
But we ain't dead.

1603
01:42:45,792 --> 01:42:47,851
Well, that makes it
even better, don't it?

1604
01:42:48,028 --> 01:42:52,692
They think we're heroes and we're a
couple of rotten, no-good deserters.

1605
01:42:55,235 --> 01:42:59,604
Golly, will they be surprised.

1606
01:42:59,773 --> 01:43:02,674
They'll kill us, that's what
they'll do. They'll kill us.

1607
01:43:13,086 --> 01:43:15,213
Hi.

1608
01:43:24,464 --> 01:43:26,295
You've gone crazy.

1609
01:43:26,466 --> 01:43:28,400
Seeing things.

1610
01:43:36,176 --> 01:43:37,200
Howdy, sergeant.

1611
01:43:37,377 --> 01:43:40,505
Private Whitledge reporting for
duty after an unforeseen delay, sir.

1612
01:43:40,680 --> 01:43:45,140
I bet you never expected to
see us again, but here we are.

1613
01:43:45,385 --> 01:43:47,751
No, no, no.

1614
01:43:47,921 --> 01:43:50,890
Didn't I tell you he'd
be surprised, Ben?

1615
01:43:52,559 --> 01:43:56,689
-Why ain't you dead?
-No excuse, sir.

1616
01:43:57,197 --> 01:44:01,725
-You ain't dead. You ain't dead.
-Well, see, I had my parachute on.

1617
01:44:01,902 --> 01:44:05,497
I was the one who
identified your remains.

1618
01:44:05,672 --> 01:44:09,199
Two charred helmets
and a handful of dust.

1619
01:44:10,043 --> 01:44:12,876
-They're having a big ceremony down there.
-Yeah.

1620
01:44:13,046 --> 01:44:17,915
Ten days ago, in
Operation Prometheus...

1621
01:44:18,084 --> 01:44:21,520
...the power of the atom
bomb was challenged....

1622
01:44:21,688 --> 01:44:23,383
-Is that the general?
-The general.

1623
01:44:23,557 --> 01:44:26,253
-Is he giving us medals?
-Medals.

1624
01:44:26,426 --> 01:44:28,326
-Now, there you go, Ben.
-General. Medals.

1625
01:44:28,495 --> 01:44:29,792
Now, get back in that room.

1626
01:44:29,963 --> 01:44:32,591
-Hey, that's no way to act, sergeant.
-Just get in there.

1627
01:44:32,766 --> 01:44:34,495
Ben and me is alive and you--

1628
01:44:34,668 --> 01:44:35,692
Stay where you are.

1629
01:44:35,869 --> 01:44:39,236
Oh, I don't deserve
this, I don't deserve....

1630
01:44:39,806 --> 01:44:42,673
Captain. Captain. Captain!

1631
01:44:42,843 --> 01:44:43,867
We'll be shot.

1632
01:44:44,044 --> 01:44:46,877
No, it's just he's kind
of surprised right now.

1633
01:44:47,047 --> 01:44:50,642
Later on they'll all be
glad we're here. You'll see.

1634
01:44:50,817 --> 01:44:55,652
Sergeant, will you--? Will
you--? What's the matter? Sar--

1635
01:44:55,822 --> 01:44:57,983
Are you nuts?

1636
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:04,692
No.

1637
01:45:04,865 --> 01:45:05,991
Oh....

1638
01:45:06,166 --> 01:45:09,932
Don't move, you
understand? Just don't move.

1639
01:45:13,807 --> 01:45:16,037
Don't move or
I'll have you shot!

1640
01:45:23,850 --> 01:45:26,410
You, get over to that
reviewing stand on the double.

1641
01:45:26,586 --> 01:45:28,315
Tell the general to
stop proceedings.

1642
01:45:28,488 --> 01:45:30,922
There's radio, television
and newsreel cameras there.

1643
01:45:31,091 --> 01:45:34,458
If he gives out posthumous medals
to two men who are in his own office...

1644
01:45:34,628 --> 01:45:37,927
...he'll be the laughing
stock of the whole country.

1645
01:45:38,098 --> 01:45:40,066
Step on it!

1646
01:45:44,004 --> 01:45:46,063
Stay away from those
windows, you understand?

1647
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:48,036
Stay away from those doors.

1648
01:45:48,208 --> 01:45:50,676
And if anybody comes in
here, you tell them you're....

1649
01:45:50,844 --> 01:45:52,937
John Jones and Jack
Smith. You got that?

1650
01:45:53,446 --> 01:45:54,606
Yes, sir.

1651
01:45:57,551 --> 01:45:59,519
They're gonna kill us.

1652
01:46:00,253 --> 01:46:04,451
-They're gonna kill us.
-No, they ain't.

1653
01:46:05,258 --> 01:46:06,953
Breathe deep.

1654
01:46:07,994 --> 01:46:09,018
What's going on here?

1655
01:46:09,195 --> 01:46:12,358
Sergeant King just jumped an air
policeman and stole his motorcycle.

1656
01:46:12,532 --> 01:46:16,434
The two men who are getting the
posthumous medals, they're inside.

1657
01:46:16,603 --> 01:46:19,834
-The medals?
-No, the men.

1658
01:46:20,106 --> 01:46:24,167
-You're drunk.
-Go ahead. Look.

1659
01:46:29,115 --> 01:46:31,310
-Who are you?
-I'm John Jones...

1660
01:46:31,484 --> 01:46:33,645
...and this here is Jack Smith.

1661
01:46:36,089 --> 01:46:38,956
Jim, if you're trying to be
comical, it'll be the last time...

1662
01:46:39,125 --> 01:46:42,993
...because jokes about the
dead is carrying it a little bit too far.

1663
01:46:45,865 --> 01:46:47,332
Well, did you stop him in time?

1664
01:46:47,500 --> 01:46:52,437
Sir, I informed him of the situation and
advised him that contrary to intelligence--

1665
01:46:52,606 --> 01:46:54,699
In English, you idiot.

1666
01:46:54,874 --> 01:46:58,366
Had he presented the
medals or had he not?

1667
01:46:58,545 --> 01:46:59,569
Yes, sir, he had, sir.

1668
01:46:59,746 --> 01:47:02,044
-Holy.
-Well, what did he say?

1669
01:47:02,215 --> 01:47:04,274
Well, sir, he said--

1670
01:47:04,451 --> 01:47:08,854
I'll court-martial everybody
in the whole damned Air Force.

1671
01:47:09,022 --> 01:47:11,490
That's what he said, sir.

1672
01:47:12,792 --> 01:47:15,989
Where are they? Where are they?

1673
01:47:16,162 --> 01:47:20,861
Where are those two privates who
hold my career in the palm of their hands?

1674
01:47:21,034 --> 01:47:22,899
In there, sir.

1675
01:47:33,013 --> 01:47:35,038
You two.

1676
01:47:35,215 --> 01:47:36,705
Yes, sir.

1677
01:47:36,883 --> 01:47:38,976
We got back as
quick as we could.

1678
01:47:39,152 --> 01:47:42,553
And I sure do appreciate
you giving us medals and all...

1679
01:47:42,722 --> 01:47:45,486
...and setting the
flags at half-mast.

1680
01:47:46,726 --> 01:47:49,194
Well, I got the whole
thing figured out too, sir.

1681
01:47:50,563 --> 01:47:53,726
Well, you know that handful of dust
Sergeant King was talking about?

1682
01:47:55,535 --> 01:47:59,130
Well, that's all it was.
A handful of dust. Heh.

1683
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:04,906
If I'd had known you all was gonna think
it was us, I'd have swept it under a seat.

1684
01:48:05,078 --> 01:48:09,515
But, anyhow, what it comes
down to is we ain't dead.

1685
01:48:19,492 --> 01:48:24,691
Ten minutes ago, in front of half the
brass in the continental United States...

1686
01:48:24,864 --> 01:48:29,665
...I awarded the Air Medal
to a handful of sweepings.

1687
01:48:29,836 --> 01:48:33,272
Do you know what this is gonna
do to me when this story gets out?

1688
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:34,737
Sir, I didn't know.

1689
01:48:34,908 --> 01:48:39,641
Tomorrow I will probably be known
throughout the entire Pentagon...

1690
01:48:39,813 --> 01:48:42,475
...as old Dustpan.

1691
01:48:46,286 --> 01:48:48,754
I've got to get those
two men off my base.

1692
01:48:48,922 --> 01:48:51,083
If anybody sees them,
if anybody hears them--

1693
01:48:51,257 --> 01:48:53,851
Sir, couldn't you transfer
them to another base?

1694
01:48:54,027 --> 01:48:56,894
Shut up. What?

1695
01:48:57,063 --> 01:48:59,793
Oh. Oh.

1696
01:49:00,967 --> 01:49:02,901
Yes.

1697
01:49:04,137 --> 01:49:08,005
You go over to S-1 and
get as many DD-613 forms...

1698
01:49:08,174 --> 01:49:10,165
-...as you can lay your hands on.
-Yes, sir.

1699
01:49:10,343 --> 01:49:13,312
You, go out and get another
car and bring it around back.

1700
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:15,380
-Quietly.
-Yes, sir.

1701
01:49:15,548 --> 01:49:19,575
Get a command car and
put the curtains up all around.

1702
01:49:22,255 --> 01:49:24,780
Well, they put us
in this here command car...

1703
01:49:24,958 --> 01:49:28,121
...and took us way out here
in the woods, real secret like...

1704
01:49:28,294 --> 01:49:31,024
...with all kinds of guards
around us and everything.

1705
01:49:32,999 --> 01:49:35,490
You know what to do.
Challenge everybody.

1706
01:49:35,668 --> 01:49:37,966
The password is: Nightmare.

1707
01:49:38,138 --> 01:49:39,696
Nightmare.

1708
01:49:39,873 --> 01:49:42,899
If anybody fails
to give it, shoot.

1709
01:49:43,076 --> 01:49:45,943
Okay, sentries, take
your posts on the double.

1710
01:49:52,418 --> 01:49:55,046
Are you sure we've got
the whole area surrounded?

1711
01:49:55,221 --> 01:49:58,054
I think so, sir. I've never
done anything like this before.

1712
01:49:58,224 --> 01:49:59,953
Well, do you think I have?

1713
01:50:00,126 --> 01:50:04,028
General, it sure is exciting,
ain't it? Where's Ben?

1714
01:50:04,197 --> 01:50:10,659
Look, you just stand right over
there and let me handle this, please.

1715
01:50:10,837 --> 01:50:14,500
What the devil is keeping General Pollard?
Are the forms ready for him to sign?

1716
01:50:14,674 --> 01:50:16,039
Corporal's working on them, sir.

1717
01:50:19,879 --> 01:50:21,847
-That must be Pollard's car now.
-Yes, sir.

1718
01:50:22,015 --> 01:50:24,074
-Speed him up.
-Yes, sir.

1719
01:50:24,584 --> 01:50:27,018
Halt. Advance
and give the password.

1720
01:50:28,888 --> 01:50:30,856
Great Scott,
they've shot Pollard.

1721
01:50:31,024 --> 01:50:34,653
Stop. Stop. Eugene,
tell these idiots to stop shooting.

1722
01:50:34,828 --> 01:50:36,557
It's me. Vernon.

1723
01:50:37,931 --> 01:50:39,262
Give the password.

1724
01:50:39,432 --> 01:50:41,866
I've forgotten
the damned thing.

1725
01:50:42,035 --> 01:50:43,059
Nightmare.

1726
01:50:43,636 --> 01:50:45,934
Nightmare!

1727
01:50:47,340 --> 01:50:49,604
Nightmare, you stupid--

1728
01:50:49,776 --> 01:50:51,403
Come back here, you.

1729
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:56,515
Look, here, Eugene, you're
carrying this thing a little too far.

1730
01:50:56,683 --> 01:50:58,878
I'm sorry, Vernon, the
sentries are nervous.

1731
01:50:59,052 --> 01:51:00,076
No reason for that.

1732
01:51:01,454 --> 01:51:02,682
-Nightmare!
-Nightmare!

1733
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:05,514
What's that?

1734
01:51:06,226 --> 01:51:09,627
I'm sorry, Vernon, it's
the other dead hero.

1735
01:51:09,796 --> 01:51:10,888
The talkative one.

1736
01:51:11,064 --> 01:51:13,464
I put him in the
trunk for total security.

1737
01:51:13,633 --> 01:51:16,864
Ben's in the trunk?
How about that?

1738
01:51:17,036 --> 01:51:19,766
-Get him out, Stockdale.
-Yes, sir.

1739
01:51:21,007 --> 01:51:24,443
Listen, Eugene, they could lower
the boom on us, pulling a deal like this.

1740
01:51:24,611 --> 01:51:26,511
We are in trouble, Vernon.

1741
01:51:26,679 --> 01:51:28,237
Clear up to our pensions.

1742
01:51:28,414 --> 01:51:31,042
Now, come on and
sign those papers.

1743
01:51:34,721 --> 01:51:36,621
Howdy, Ben.

1744
01:51:37,991 --> 01:51:39,925
Oh....

1745
01:51:40,093 --> 01:51:43,062
I knew it. I knew it.

1746
01:51:43,229 --> 01:51:45,857
They got us out in the
middle of no man's land.

1747
01:51:46,032 --> 01:51:49,195
Oh, I don't know. I
think it's kind of pleasant.

1748
01:51:49,369 --> 01:51:51,030
Goodbye, Will.

1749
01:51:51,204 --> 01:51:54,469
-We just got here, Ben.
-And we ain't never going back.

1750
01:51:54,641 --> 01:51:57,974
Will, I know you didn't
do it on purpose...

1751
01:51:58,144 --> 01:52:00,772
...and I know there wasn't
no meanness behind it.

1752
01:52:02,015 --> 01:52:03,812
I forgive you.

1753
01:52:04,717 --> 01:52:08,448
-Then we're buddies again?
-For a little while.

1754
01:52:08,621 --> 01:52:10,248
All right, Whitledge, you first.

1755
01:52:10,423 --> 01:52:14,757
Sentry, take him in there, have
him sign everything in triplicate.

1756
01:52:16,829 --> 01:52:20,162
-Bye, Will.
-Bye, Ben.

1757
01:52:20,333 --> 01:52:24,429
Golly, is he gonna be surprised.

1758
01:52:27,473 --> 01:52:32,376
You know, everybody's all the time
saying how sergeants is mean and tough.

1759
01:52:32,545 --> 01:52:37,175
So I'm right glad you was my first
one because you showed me different.

1760
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:39,113
Why, thank you, Will.

1761
01:52:41,154 --> 01:52:43,645
All right, Will, I'm gonna
give you the watch anyway.

1762
01:52:43,823 --> 01:52:48,317
-Oh, gee, I never held that against you.
-Oh, go on and take it.

1763
01:52:48,494 --> 01:52:51,088
My mother would be
glad for you to have it.

1764
01:52:51,264 --> 01:52:52,526
We're square now.

1765
01:52:52,699 --> 01:52:55,133
I don't owe you nothing and
you don't owe me nothing.

1766
01:52:55,301 --> 01:52:56,996
We're square.

1767
01:52:58,104 --> 01:52:59,128
-King?
-Yeah.

1768
01:52:59,305 --> 01:53:01,273
What's the matter
with that Whitledge?

1769
01:53:01,441 --> 01:53:07,243
He keeps saying he's sorry he has
only one life to give for his country.

1770
01:53:08,881 --> 01:53:11,509
He figures you brought
us out here to get shot.

1771
01:53:12,185 --> 01:53:13,777
-Shot?
-Shot.

1772
01:53:15,755 --> 01:53:18,053
Ridiculous.

1773
01:53:18,291 --> 01:53:20,486
All these witnesses, Vernon.

1774
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:22,628
Take a smoke. Ahem.

1775
01:53:22,795 --> 01:53:26,356
All right, Stockdale, I just have a
couple of letters for you to sign...

1776
01:53:26,532 --> 01:53:28,796
...and then we'll be through
with this whole mess.

1777
01:53:28,968 --> 01:53:30,959
This one's to your folks...

1778
01:53:31,137 --> 01:53:36,131
...saying that you're on a
very important secret mission.

1779
01:53:36,309 --> 01:53:40,473
This one certifies you've never
heard of Operation Prometheus...

1780
01:53:40,646 --> 01:53:44,309
...and have never been on
my base in your entire life.

1781
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:46,645
Sign here.

1782
01:53:50,123 --> 01:53:53,581
But, if we never heard of
Operation What You Call It...

1783
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:56,422
-...we don't get no medals, do we?
-Medals? Of course not.

1784
01:53:56,596 --> 01:53:57,620
Sign here.

1785
01:53:57,797 --> 01:54:00,857
Ben, he sets a whole lot of stock
in medals and things like that.

1786
01:54:01,134 --> 01:54:05,468
You want me to present a medal out
in the woods in the middle of the night?

1787
01:54:05,638 --> 01:54:06,730
That's right.

1788
01:54:06,906 --> 01:54:11,275
Hey, we can get everybody standing up all
around and turn one of the cars around...

1789
01:54:11,444 --> 01:54:13,378
...so the lights are shining.

1790
01:54:13,546 --> 01:54:17,175
-Hey, maybe get a little music on the radio.
-No, no. I don't have any medals.

1791
01:54:17,350 --> 01:54:19,750
- Hey, driver, would you mind turning...?
- Come back.

1792
01:54:19,919 --> 01:54:23,320
-How long is this going to take, Eugene?
-I didn't bring any medals.

1793
01:54:23,489 --> 01:54:24,979
Now what? I wanna get to bed.

1794
01:54:25,158 --> 01:54:29,185
You hear me? I said
I didn't have any--

1795
01:54:32,331 --> 01:54:34,026
Oh....

1796
01:54:34,200 --> 01:54:36,327
What are you staring at?

1797
01:54:36,502 --> 01:54:41,201
Vernon, old man, I
wonder if you'd give me...

1798
01:54:41,374 --> 01:54:42,671
...one of your medals?

1799
01:54:42,842 --> 01:54:44,139
What?

1800
01:54:44,310 --> 01:54:47,211
Just one, Vernon, please.

1801
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:50,474
You've got so many of them.

1802
01:54:50,683 --> 01:54:54,744
-What are you talking about, Eugene?
-Stockdale wants a medal.

1803
01:54:55,254 --> 01:54:57,552
That does it. He
goes to Leavenworth.

1804
01:54:57,723 --> 01:55:00,556
No, no.

1805
01:55:00,726 --> 01:55:02,353
We might go with him.

1806
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:07,022
Vernon, if you give me one of
yours, I'll give you two of mine.

1807
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:10,465
-I swear I will.
-But these medals are sewn on.

1808
01:55:10,636 --> 01:55:12,194
Sewn? POLLARD:
Yes, by heavens.

1809
01:55:12,371 --> 01:55:14,669
His medals are sewn on.

1810
01:55:14,841 --> 01:55:17,309
I got my mumblety-peg knife.

1811
01:55:18,911 --> 01:55:21,880
Just a small one,
please, Vernon?

1812
01:55:22,048 --> 01:55:25,540
I'll do this in private,
if you don't mind.

1813
01:55:26,352 --> 01:55:28,980
This is radio station WQUID...

1814
01:55:29,155 --> 01:55:31,988
...now presenting a medley
of your favorite band music.

1815
01:55:32,158 --> 01:55:36,458
There's nothing else you can
think of at this moment, is there?

1816
01:55:36,629 --> 01:55:40,725
You do realize why we don't
have a brass band, don't you?

1817
01:55:41,534 --> 01:55:44,401
I wouldn't worry about that
none, sir. This here'll do fine.

1818
01:55:44,570 --> 01:55:46,765
I'll just get everybody
lined up over here.

1819
01:55:49,275 --> 01:55:52,403
-Y'all come on in! KING:
Resist! On the double!

1820
01:55:52,578 --> 01:55:54,512
Everybody come on in!

1821
01:55:54,680 --> 01:55:56,272
- On the double.
- Come on.

1822
01:55:56,449 --> 01:55:58,815
Line up, boy,
right here. Come on.

1823
01:55:58,985 --> 01:56:02,011
Come on, give me the
papers. Line up on the double.

1824
01:56:08,094 --> 01:56:11,586
I've been blackmailed, I've been
shanghaied, I've been shot at...

1825
01:56:11,764 --> 01:56:13,561
...and now I've been robbed.

1826
01:56:13,733 --> 01:56:14,757
By dog.

1827
01:56:14,934 --> 01:56:18,392
Boy, Ben's gonna pop his shirt when
both of you generals snap to attention.

1828
01:56:18,571 --> 01:56:20,732
-Do what?
-Vernon, please.

1829
01:56:20,907 --> 01:56:22,534
Never.

1830
01:56:22,708 --> 01:56:24,266
I'll stand at attention.

1831
01:56:24,443 --> 01:56:28,573
I'll stand on my head if
you'll just sign these papers.

1832
01:56:28,748 --> 01:56:29,772
I'll go fetch Ben.

1833
01:56:29,949 --> 01:56:31,712
-Have the orders to read?
-Yes, sir.

1834
01:56:31,884 --> 01:56:33,909
-Good.
-I'll get Ben.

1835
01:56:35,655 --> 01:56:36,679
Come on, Ben.

1836
01:56:36,856 --> 01:56:40,223
No, Will. Don't they give you
one last request or something?

1837
01:56:40,393 --> 01:56:43,453
All right, you asked
for it. Come out and get it.

1838
01:56:43,629 --> 01:56:48,657
That's right, Ben. Now, strut
right up to the general and salute.

1839
01:56:49,135 --> 01:56:51,797
He's got something
he's gonna give you.

1840
01:56:52,071 --> 01:56:53,629
I know.

1841
01:56:54,006 --> 01:56:55,735
Goodbye, Will.

1842
01:57:06,185 --> 01:57:07,209
King.

1843
01:57:07,386 --> 01:57:10,184
"The following enlisted men
are hereby relieved of duty...

1844
01:57:10,356 --> 01:57:14,019
...and removed from the records
of Major General Eugene Bush...

1845
01:57:14,193 --> 01:57:17,424
...and transferred to the command
of Major General Vernon Pollard...

1846
01:57:17,597 --> 01:57:20,191
...U.S. Army infantry."

1847
01:57:20,366 --> 01:57:22,664
-What?
-Private Benjamin B. Whitledge.

1848
01:57:22,835 --> 01:57:27,101
-Private Will Stockdale.
-We're in the infantry, Ben.

1849
01:57:27,273 --> 01:57:28,604
-The infantry?
-Yeah.

1850
01:57:28,774 --> 01:57:30,332
Well, so long, boys.

1851
01:57:30,509 --> 01:57:32,443
It's been swell knowing you.

1852
01:57:32,612 --> 01:57:34,375
-So long, sergeant.
-So long, sergeant.

1853
01:57:34,547 --> 01:57:37,345
Wish I could be going
along with you, but that's life.

1854
01:57:39,051 --> 01:57:41,815
Hey, couldn't he, sir?
Couldn't he go along with us?

1855
01:57:41,988 --> 01:57:45,446
Brilliant idea,
Stockdale. Brilliant.

1856
01:57:45,625 --> 01:57:47,820
No, no, no.

1857
01:57:47,994 --> 01:57:51,589
-We are still gonna be together.
-In the infantry.

1858
01:57:51,764 --> 01:57:53,493
What happened?

1859
01:57:53,666 --> 01:57:55,827
Detail, attention.

1860
01:57:56,002 --> 01:57:59,301
That's one thing I won't do.

1861
01:57:59,939 --> 01:58:02,305
Station
WQUID signing off.

1862
01:58:07,446 --> 01:58:11,177
It gives me great pleasure
to award this Air Medal...

1863
01:58:11,350 --> 01:58:13,648
...which through a
regrettable error...

1864
01:58:13,819 --> 01:58:16,686
...was previously
awarded posthumously...

1865
01:58:16,856 --> 01:58:20,952
...to Private Benjamin
B. Whitledge...

1866
01:58:21,127 --> 01:58:24,619
...U.S. Army infantry.

1867
01:58:25,064 --> 01:58:26,964
Present arms.
