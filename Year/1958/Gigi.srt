1
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:42,006
<i>Bonjour, monsieur.</i>

2
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:45,009
<i>Bonjour, madame... and company.</i>

3
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:51,140
Good afternoon.

4
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:55,103
As you see, this lovely city
all around us is Paris.

5
00:02:55,395 --> 00:02:59,357
And this lovely park is, of course,
the Bois de Boulogne.

6
00:02:59,607 --> 00:03:00,900
Pardon me.

7
00:03:07,824 --> 00:03:08,866
Who am I?

8
00:03:09,075 --> 00:03:11,703
Well, allow me to introduce myself.

9
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:14,289
I am Honoré Lachaille.

10
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:16,291
Born: Paris.

11
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:17,625
Date:

12
00:03:18,876 --> 00:03:20,044
Not lately.

13
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:22,964
This is 1900.
So let's just say...

14
00:03:23,214 --> 00:03:25,300
...not in this century.

15
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,135
Circumstances:

16
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:28,511
Comfortable.

17
00:03:28,803 --> 00:03:29,804
Profession:

18
00:03:30,054 --> 00:03:33,558
Lover and collector
of beautiful things.

19
00:03:34,225 --> 00:03:35,810
Not antiques, mind you.

20
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:37,645
Younger things.

21
00:03:42,025 --> 00:03:44,360
Yes, definitely younger.

22
00:03:44,611 --> 00:03:47,155
Married?
What for?

23
00:03:47,363 --> 00:03:49,324
Now, please don't misunderstand.

24
00:03:49,616 --> 00:03:52,910
Like everywhere else,
most people in Paris get married.

25
00:03:53,119 --> 00:03:54,495
But not all.

26
00:03:54,746 --> 00:03:59,125
There are some who will not marry
and some who do not marry.

27
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,254
But here in Paris,
those who will not are usually men...

28
00:04:03,546 --> 00:04:07,091
...and those who do not
are usually women.

29
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:11,387
Now, for example,
here we find exhibit A:

30
00:04:11,888 --> 00:04:13,306
The married kind.

31
00:04:13,806 --> 00:04:16,184
<i>These ladies stood their ground
And won</i>

32
00:04:16,434 --> 00:04:18,645
<i>And I salute them, every one</i>

33
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:25,985
<i>Here are some others to behold</i>

34
00:04:26,235 --> 00:04:28,404
<i>For whom the bells have never tolled</i>

35
00:04:28,655 --> 00:04:31,449
<i>Oh, what a poor, defenseless pair</i>

36
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:33,993
<i>In those pathetic rags they wear</i>

37
00:05:00,144 --> 00:05:03,022
And there is the future.

38
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,239
Someday, each and every one of them...

39
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:13,741
...will either be married...

40
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,828
...or unmarried.
How adorable they are!

41
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,080
<i>Each time I see a little girl</i>

42
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:21,457
<i>Of 5 or 6 or 7</i>

43
00:05:21,833 --> 00:05:24,043
<i>I can't resist the joyous urge</i>

44
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:27,088
<i>To smile and say thank heaven</i>

45
00:05:27,964 --> 00:05:30,049
<i>For little girls</i>

46
00:05:31,134 --> 00:05:34,137
<i>For little girls
Get bigger every day</i>

47
00:05:36,222 --> 00:05:38,975
<i>Thank heaven for little girls</i>

48
00:05:41,144 --> 00:05:44,355
<i>They grow up
In the most delightful way</i>

49
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:49,402
<i>Those little eyes
So helpless and appealing</i>

50
00:05:50,445 --> 00:05:54,657
<i>One day will flash and send you
Crashing through the ceiling</i>

51
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:58,620
<i>Thank heaven for little girls</i>

52
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,540
<i>Thank heaven for them all</i>

53
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:05,460
<i>No matter where
No matter who</i>

54
00:06:05,752 --> 00:06:08,630
<i>Without them
What would little boys do?</i>

55
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:11,966
<i>Thank heaven</i>

56
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:14,510
<i>Thank heaven</i>

57
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:16,888
<i>Thank heaven</i>

58
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,140
<i>For little girls</i>

59
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:27,065
This story is about a little girl.

60
00:06:27,315 --> 00:06:30,735
It could be any one of those girls
playing there. But it isn't.

61
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:32,820
It's about one in particular.

62
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:35,698
That one.
Her name is Gigi.

63
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,450
Gigi!

64
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:41,120
What you have to look forward to!

65
00:06:44,082 --> 00:06:47,543
<i>Those little eyes
So helpless and appealing</i>

66
00:06:48,294 --> 00:06:52,382
<i>One day will flash and send you
Crashing through the ceiling</i>

67
00:06:53,383 --> 00:06:54,717
<i>Thank heaven</i>

68
00:06:55,593 --> 00:06:57,387
<i>For little girls</i>

69
00:06:58,513 --> 00:07:00,223
<i>Thank heaven for them all</i>

70
00:07:00,473 --> 00:07:03,059
<i>No matter where
No matter who</i>

71
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:06,562
<i>Without them
What would little boys do?</i>

72
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:09,399
<i>Thank heaven</i>

73
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:11,901
<i>Thank heaven</i>

74
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,075
<i>Thank heaven</i>

75
00:07:19,993 --> 00:07:23,538
<i>For little girls!</i>

76
00:07:43,266 --> 00:07:44,684
Hello, Grandmama.

77
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:47,437
Gigi, where have you been?

78
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:49,939
Playing in the park.
I had to, Grandmama.

79
00:07:50,148 --> 00:07:52,984
My foot fell asleep in class.
It wouldn't wake up.

80
00:07:53,192 --> 00:07:55,153
Did you forget what day it is?

81
00:07:55,361 --> 00:07:56,946
It's Tuesday.

82
00:07:57,488 --> 00:08:00,283
Aunt Alicia!
Well, I'd better run.

83
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:04,245
You cannot go to your Aunt Alicia's
looking like that.

84
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:06,873
Put your coat on.
Let me comb your hair.

85
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:08,207
Yes, Grandmama.

86
00:08:10,126 --> 00:08:13,671
I hate this coat.
It makes my legs feel so long.

87
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,215
Yes, your legs are long.

88
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:18,468
You know...

89
00:08:18,676 --> 00:08:23,097
...sometimes I'm sorry
you never learned to dance.

90
00:08:23,306 --> 00:08:27,769
But I want to, Grandmama.
Why don't you let me take lessons?

91
00:08:27,977 --> 00:08:30,229
No. Not the same mistake twice.

92
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,025
Your mother took singing lessons,
and look where she ended up.

93
00:08:34,359 --> 00:08:38,863
Slaving away at the Opéra-Comique
in ridiculous little roles.

94
00:08:39,113 --> 00:08:40,823
- She seems happy.
- Happy!

95
00:08:41,074 --> 00:08:43,826
I went to see her one night.
I couldn't even find her.

96
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:45,328
In the first act...

97
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:47,497
...she was behind a tree.

98
00:08:47,705 --> 00:08:49,082
In the second act...

99
00:08:49,457 --> 00:08:51,042
...behind a tenor.

100
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,634
Mama's awake.
Isn't it early?

101
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:02,929
<i>She's on this afternoon.
If I Were King.</i>

102
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:07,517
That's more than she does
in the whole opera.

103
00:09:08,977 --> 00:09:12,146
And when I think of
that delightful old gentleman...

104
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:14,148
...with all those flour mills.

105
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,441
Who?

106
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:17,151
Nothing.

107
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,447
You go to school every morning.
You see your Aunt Alicia once a week.

108
00:09:21,823 --> 00:09:23,992
That's all the lessons you need.

109
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:25,827
When the time comes,
you'll be ready.

110
00:09:26,035 --> 00:09:28,162
Ready for what, Grandmama?

111
00:09:28,913 --> 00:09:30,748
Enough. Now run.

112
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,751
- Goodbye, Grandmama.
- Goodbye, Gigi.

113
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:57,150
- More powerful, monsieur.
Sixty kilometers an hour!

114
00:09:57,692 --> 00:10:01,154
There's nothing faster on the road,
monsieur. Not here or in America.

115
00:10:01,362 --> 00:10:03,031
Your uncle is here, monsieur.

116
00:10:03,281 --> 00:10:06,659
Of course, the smaller is
a first-rate machine, monsieur.

117
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:09,120
Naturally, the larger one
is more expensive.

118
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:10,872
I'd be happy to
demonstrate both.

119
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,834
I beg your pardon, Monsieur Gaston.
Your father wanted me to ask you...

120
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:18,796
...did you, by any chance, buy the
Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée Railroad?

121
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:21,883
The Paris-Lyon-Méd...?
Yes, yes, I did.

122
00:10:22,091 --> 00:10:24,928
<i>According to this morning's
opening at la Bourse...</i>

123
00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:26,804
...it's gone up 12 points.

124
00:10:27,055 --> 00:10:28,181
I thought it would.

125
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:31,142
Monsieur Lachaille, about the car.

126
00:10:31,643 --> 00:10:33,645
Send it over in the morning
with the bill.

127
00:10:33,895 --> 00:10:36,814
Yes, monsieur. Thank you.
But which one?

128
00:10:37,065 --> 00:10:40,109
My dear fellow, I don't care.
Either one.

129
00:10:40,735 --> 00:10:43,988
I'm sorry I kept you waiting, Uncle.
Why didn't you come upstairs?

130
00:10:44,197 --> 00:10:46,658
I was afraid I'd meet
my brother and sister-in-law.

131
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:49,077
- You would have.
- I have to tell you...

132
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:50,995
...your parents bore me to death.

133
00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:53,706
- Me too.
- But I've known them longer...

134
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:55,959
...so they've been boring me longer.

135
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:57,293
After you.

136
00:10:57,961 --> 00:11:00,380
Your father is actually quite unique.

137
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,424
He was a bore at the age of 5.

138
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,054
All he has to say is, "Hello,"
and I can barely keep my eyes open.

139
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:09,555
Armenonville.

140
00:11:16,354 --> 00:11:19,732
I waited for you at the embassy
last Sunday. What happened?

141
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:22,694
The thought of another embassy tea
paralyzed me.

142
00:11:22,944 --> 00:11:26,322
Instead, I had tea with an old friend
Madame Alvarez.

143
00:11:26,739 --> 00:11:28,574
- Madame Alvarez?
- Yes, you know her.

144
00:11:28,783 --> 00:11:30,952
Or knew her once, didn't you?

145
00:11:31,286 --> 00:11:34,372
- Does she say I did?
- I think she's mentioned it.

146
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:36,291
Then I suppose I did.

147
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:39,585
It's the one place in Paris
where I can go and relax.

148
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,130
Whose luncheon are you
taking me to today?

149
00:11:42,338 --> 00:11:43,756
Henri Trouvère.

150
00:11:44,173 --> 00:11:45,466
We have to go.

151
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:48,428
I'm meeting a heavenly creature there.

152
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:51,472
You're still young, Uncle, aren't you?

153
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:53,975
Not compared to her.

154
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:56,519
But I must say,
I am compared to you.

155
00:11:56,728 --> 00:12:00,106
Maybe it's the women you go with.
How old is Liane?

156
00:12:00,356 --> 00:12:01,524
About 30.

157
00:12:02,066 --> 00:12:05,069
That may be it.
Youth is the thing, Gaston.

158
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,780
Youth!
Stay close to the young...

159
00:12:08,072 --> 00:12:09,741
...and a little rubs off.

160
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:11,159
I'm bored.

161
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:12,327
Bored?

162
00:12:13,494 --> 00:12:17,707
<i>Look at all the captivating
Fascinating things there are to do</i>

163
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:19,667
<i>Name two</i>

164
00:12:20,585 --> 00:12:21,711
<i>Look at all the pleasures</i>

165
00:12:21,961 --> 00:12:25,006
<i>All the myriad of treasures
We have got</i>

166
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:26,716
<i>Like what?</i>

167
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:30,219
<i>Look at Paris in the spring
When each solitary thing</i>

168
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:33,264
<i>Is more beautiful than ever before</i>

169
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:37,435
<i>You can hear every tree
Almost saying, "Look at me!"</i>

170
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:39,187
- What color are the trees?
- Green!

171
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:40,772
- What color were they last year?
- Green!

172
00:12:41,022 --> 00:12:42,774
- And next year?
- Green!

173
00:12:43,024 --> 00:12:44,525
<i>It's a bore</i>

174
00:12:44,776 --> 00:12:48,154
<i>Don't you marvel at the power
Of the mighty Eiffel Tower</i>

175
00:12:48,363 --> 00:12:51,157
<i>Knowing there it will remain evermore</i>

176
00:12:51,574 --> 00:12:52,992
<i>Climbing up to the sky</i>

177
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:54,702
<i>Over 90 stories high</i>

178
00:12:54,994 --> 00:12:56,371
- How many stories?
- Ninety!

179
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,206
- How many yesterday?
- Ninety!

180
00:12:58,456 --> 00:13:00,083
- And tomorrow?
- Ninety!

181
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,751
<i>It's a bore!</i>

182
00:13:02,001 --> 00:13:03,461
<i>The river Seine</i>

183
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:05,254
<i>All it can do is flow</i>

184
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:06,965
<i>But think of wine</i>

185
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:08,132
<i>It's red or white</i>

186
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,220
<i>- But think of girls
- It's either yes or no</i>

187
00:13:12,428 --> 00:13:16,015
<i>And if it's no or if it's yes
It simply couldn't matter less</i>

188
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:17,433
<i>But think of a race</i>

189
00:13:17,684 --> 00:13:19,519
<i>With your horse in seventh place</i>

190
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:21,104
<i>Then he suddenly begins</i>

191
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:24,315
<i>And he catches up and wins
With a roar!</i>

192
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,900
<i>It's a bore!</i>

193
00:13:26,317 --> 00:13:27,986
<i>Life is thrilling as can be</i>

194
00:13:28,236 --> 00:13:29,654
<i>Simply not my cup of tea</i>

195
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:31,406
<i>It's a gay, romantic fling</i>

196
00:13:31,656 --> 00:13:32,991
<i>If you like that sort of thing</i>

197
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:34,867
<i>- It's intriguing
- It's fatiguing</i>

198
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:35,994
<i>It's a game</i>

199
00:13:36,244 --> 00:13:39,580
<i>It's the same dull world
Wherever you go</i>

200
00:13:40,164 --> 00:13:42,583
<i>Whatever place you are at</i>

201
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:45,878
<i>The Earth is round</i>

202
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:49,299
<i>But everything on it is flat</i>

203
00:13:51,593 --> 00:13:54,887
<i>Don't tell me
Venice has no lure</i>

204
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:56,931
<i>Just a town without a sewer</i>

205
00:13:57,181 --> 00:13:59,350
<i>The Leaning Tower I adore</i>

206
00:13:59,642 --> 00:14:01,894
<i>Indecision is a bore</i>

207
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:05,273
<i>But think of the thrill
Of a bullfight in Seville</i>

208
00:14:05,523 --> 00:14:07,233
<i>When the bull is uncontrolled</i>

209
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:10,111
<i>And he charges at the bold matador!</i>

210
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:12,113
<i>It's a bore!</i>

211
00:14:12,322 --> 00:14:13,740
<i>Think of lunch beneath the trees</i>

212
00:14:13,948 --> 00:14:15,533
<i>Stop the carriage, if you please</i>

213
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:17,118
<i>You mean you don't want to come?</i>

214
00:14:17,327 --> 00:14:18,828
<i>The thought of lunch leaves me numb</i>

215
00:14:18,995 --> 00:14:20,121
<i>But I implore</i>

216
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:22,040
Oh, no, Uncle.

217
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,791
<i>It's a bore!</i>

218
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:33,384
Goodbye, Honoré.

219
00:14:39,807 --> 00:14:40,850
Come in.

220
00:14:42,185 --> 00:14:44,187
- Mamita.
- Gaston!

221
00:14:44,604 --> 00:14:46,940
What a wonderful surprise.

222
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,650
How do you feel today, dear Mamita?

223
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,195
Fine, Gaston.
And the better for seeing you.

224
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:55,990
You've gotten a trifle thinner,
and it's most becoming.

225
00:14:56,199 --> 00:14:58,201
- You think so?
- Oh, yes.

226
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:00,244
Come and sit down.

227
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:02,038
In your chair.

228
00:15:02,288 --> 00:15:03,498
Thank you.

229
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,043
What beautiful material.

230
00:15:07,418 --> 00:15:08,670
Very chic!

231
00:15:09,337 --> 00:15:12,048
Just the sort of thing
Honoré used to wear.

232
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:16,511
A bit more conservative, perhaps.

233
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:19,055
Would you like a sweet?

234
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:22,684
No, thank you. But I would love a cup
of your chamomile tea.

235
00:15:22,976 --> 00:15:24,185
But of course.

236
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,312
More than just one, I hope.

237
00:15:26,562 --> 00:15:28,731
Do you have a telephone yet, Mamita?

238
00:15:28,982 --> 00:15:30,441
No, not yet.

239
00:15:30,692 --> 00:15:34,529
Not until Gigi is old enough
to have secrets and admirers.

240
00:15:34,862 --> 00:15:37,615
But there's one upstairs
if it's important.

241
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:39,367
It's not important.

242
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,621
Gigi's not at home?

243
00:15:43,913 --> 00:15:45,873
No. This is Tuesday.

244
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:49,627
The day she has luncheon
with her aunt Alicia.

245
00:15:50,128 --> 00:15:52,880
How is your sister?
I haven't seen her for quite a while.

246
00:15:53,172 --> 00:15:54,757
I don't wonder.

247
00:15:55,008 --> 00:15:58,386
She never sets foot out of
her apartment or her past.

248
00:15:58,636 --> 00:16:00,930
And quite a past it was...

249
00:16:01,347 --> 00:16:02,390
...so she says.

250
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,601
According to the stories
Honoré tells me...

251
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:06,769
...what she says is quite true.

252
00:16:07,353 --> 00:16:09,272
Aren't you afraid of
her influence on Gigi?

253
00:16:09,522 --> 00:16:10,690
Not at all.

254
00:16:11,107 --> 00:16:13,860
She finds Gigi a trifle backward...

255
00:16:14,235 --> 00:16:15,612
...which is true...

256
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,447
...and she educates her.

257
00:16:17,697 --> 00:16:19,073
Educates her?

258
00:16:19,824 --> 00:16:23,119
Last week, she taught her
to eat cold lobster...

259
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:24,621
...to perfection.

260
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:26,414
What in heaven's name for?

261
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:29,417
She says it's extremely useful.

262
00:16:30,001 --> 00:16:31,210
Marvelous.

263
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,675
It's so good to be here.

264
00:16:38,426 --> 00:16:40,720
It's always a pleasure
to watch the rich...

265
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,598
...enjoying the comforts of the poor.

266
00:16:44,223 --> 00:16:46,309
Especially you, dear Gaston.

267
00:16:47,435 --> 00:16:50,188
How does your sister look?
Still as young as ever?

268
00:16:50,438 --> 00:16:52,565
Yes, Alicia is always the same.

269
00:16:53,107 --> 00:16:55,818
Living in the past
must agree with her.

270
00:16:56,861 --> 00:16:58,112
When I think...

271
00:16:58,404 --> 00:16:59,697
...it was in...

272
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:01,741
...1859...

273
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:04,160
...she went off with her first sultan.

274
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:06,412
Then came her Duke of Milan...

275
00:17:06,663 --> 00:17:10,166
...her King of Spain,
her khedive, her maharajah.

276
00:17:10,541 --> 00:17:13,127
She's remarkable looking...

277
00:17:38,486 --> 00:17:39,529
Good day, Charles.

278
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:40,446
Mademoiselle.

279
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:42,323
What are we having for lunch?

280
00:17:42,865 --> 00:17:44,075
Ortolans.

281
00:17:44,492 --> 00:17:46,995
Oh, dear!
Are they difficult?

282
00:17:50,331 --> 00:17:52,667
Slowly, Gigi. Slowly.

283
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:55,253
The racing season is over.

284
00:17:55,753 --> 00:17:57,213
Good day, Aunt Alicia.

285
00:17:57,422 --> 00:17:59,841
Now let's go into luncheon.

286
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:01,467
Yes, Aunt Alicia.

287
00:18:01,718 --> 00:18:05,138
Today you will learn to eat ortolans.

288
00:18:24,449 --> 00:18:25,867
What are ortolans, Aunt?

289
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:27,869
Exquisite little birds.

290
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:30,955
Most people attack them like cannibals.

291
00:18:31,247 --> 00:18:33,249
You must learn to eat them properly.

292
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:34,792
Bad table manners...

293
00:18:35,043 --> 00:18:38,421
...have broken up more households
than infidelity.

294
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:48,723
Did you work hard in school today?
What did you study?

295
00:18:48,932 --> 00:18:49,974
History.

296
00:18:50,224 --> 00:18:52,477
Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.

297
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:53,937
How depressing.

298
00:18:54,187 --> 00:18:56,064
- What else?
- English.

299
00:18:56,314 --> 00:18:59,359
English?
I suppose we must.

300
00:18:59,567 --> 00:19:01,945
They refuse to learn French.

301
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,197
Who are your friends?

302
00:19:04,697 --> 00:19:08,326
Ortolans should be cut in two
with a quick stroke of the knife.

303
00:19:10,578 --> 00:19:13,748
There must be no grating
of the blade on the plate.

304
00:19:18,753 --> 00:19:21,172
Now bite up each piece.

305
00:19:27,804 --> 00:19:29,389
The bones don't matter.

306
00:19:29,764 --> 00:19:32,392
Go on eating while you
answer my questions.

307
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,310
But don't talk with your mouth full.

308
00:19:34,602 --> 00:19:37,522
Well, you can do it.
If I can do it, you can.

309
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:39,399
What friends have you made?

310
00:19:42,652 --> 00:19:43,945
None.

311
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,155
I'm always on my own.

312
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:51,953
Why does Grandmama stop me
from accepting invitations?

313
00:19:52,203 --> 00:19:53,579
She's right for once.

314
00:19:53,788 --> 00:19:56,291
You'd only be invited
by ordinary people.

315
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,002
What about us?
Aren't we ordinary people?

316
00:20:00,712 --> 00:20:02,046
Why are we different?

317
00:20:02,297 --> 00:20:05,758
They have weak heads
and careless bodies.

318
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:07,885
Besides, they are married.

319
00:20:08,136 --> 00:20:10,763
But I don't think you would understand.

320
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:13,224
Oh, yes, Aunt, I understand.

321
00:20:14,183 --> 00:20:15,560
We don't marry,
is that it?

322
00:20:18,855 --> 00:20:21,733
Marriage is not forbidden to us.

323
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,569
But instead of
getting married at once...

324
00:20:24,861 --> 00:20:27,614
...it sometimes happens
we get married...

325
00:20:27,864 --> 00:20:28,698
...at last.

326
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,747
Enough. We must finish lunch
and get on with your lessons.

327
00:20:35,955 --> 00:20:37,665
Now, go on.
Go on, go on!

328
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:48,968
Without knowledge ofjewelry,
my dear Gigi...

329
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,970
...a woman is lost.

330
00:20:51,262 --> 00:20:54,474
Do you remember Madame Dunard,
who was here the other day?

331
00:20:54,682 --> 00:20:57,602
Did you notice that rope
of black pearls around her throat?

332
00:20:57,852 --> 00:20:59,354
Yes! It was beautiful.

333
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:01,022
Dipped.

334
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,193
Dipped. Given to her
by the man she loves...

335
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:07,862
...whose love is obviously
beginning to cool...

336
00:21:08,112 --> 00:21:09,906
...and she doesn't know it.

337
00:21:10,198 --> 00:21:13,034
It's just a matter of time now.

338
00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:18,039
Now, let us see what you remember.

339
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:19,958
What is this?

340
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,669
A marquise diamond.

341
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:25,505
A marquise-shaped diamond.

342
00:21:27,674 --> 00:21:28,716
This?

343
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:30,510
This is...

344
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,596
...a topaz?

345
00:21:33,846 --> 00:21:35,056
A topaz?

346
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:37,850
Among myjewels?
Are you mad?

347
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:41,729
It's a yellow diamond
of the first quality.

348
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:45,275
You'll have to go a long way
to see one like it.

349
00:21:46,818 --> 00:21:48,736
- This?
- An emerald.

350
00:21:48,987 --> 00:21:50,238
How beautiful.

351
00:21:50,488 --> 00:21:51,823
Do you see that blue flame...

352
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:54,575
...darting about in the depths
of the green light?

353
00:21:54,826 --> 00:21:56,661
Only the most beautiful emeralds...

354
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:00,206
...contain that miracle
of elusive blue.

355
00:22:00,456 --> 00:22:02,875
- Who gave it to you, Aunt?
- A king.

356
00:22:03,167 --> 00:22:05,086
- A great king?
- No, a little one.

357
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:07,505
Great kings do not
give very large stones.

358
00:22:07,755 --> 00:22:08,590
Why not?

359
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:11,968
In my opinion, it's because
they don't feel they have to.

360
00:22:12,302 --> 00:22:14,304
Who does give the valuable jewels?

361
00:22:14,512 --> 00:22:15,346
Who?

362
00:22:15,597 --> 00:22:18,099
Oh, the shy, the proud.

363
00:22:18,308 --> 00:22:21,477
And the social climbers.
They think it's a sign of culture.

364
00:22:21,686 --> 00:22:23,938
But it doesn't matter
who gives them...

365
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:27,317
...as long as you never
wear anything second-rate.

366
00:22:27,483 --> 00:22:31,070
Wait for the first-class jewels, Gigi.

367
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:33,531
Hold on to your ideals.

368
00:22:34,032 --> 00:22:36,242
Come over here to the light, Gigi.

369
00:22:40,705 --> 00:22:41,956
Open your mouth.

370
00:22:44,042 --> 00:22:45,251
With teeth like that...

371
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:49,505
...I could have devoured
all Paris and most of Europe.

372
00:22:49,714 --> 00:22:52,508
But I can't complain.
I had a good bite of it.

373
00:22:54,177 --> 00:22:56,888
Tell your grandmama
to get you some astringent lotion.

374
00:22:57,138 --> 00:22:59,057
You don't use face powder, do you?

375
00:22:59,307 --> 00:23:01,601
- Grandmama won't let me.
- I should hope not.

376
00:23:01,893 --> 00:23:04,729
You have an impossible nose,
a nondescript mouth.

377
00:23:04,938 --> 00:23:07,315
Your cheekbones are too high.

378
00:23:07,941 --> 00:23:11,486
But we can do something
with the rest of you.

379
00:23:11,694 --> 00:23:13,404
Your teeth, your eyes...

380
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:15,865
...your eyelashes, your hair.

381
00:23:16,074 --> 00:23:17,075
We can...

382
00:23:17,283 --> 00:23:18,868
...and we will.

383
00:23:20,036 --> 00:23:22,038
You must learn to choose cigars.

384
00:23:22,246 --> 00:23:24,540
Aunt, but I don't smoke cigars.

385
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,793
Of course you don't smoke cigars.

386
00:23:27,001 --> 00:23:29,003
But a man does.

387
00:23:29,754 --> 00:23:31,673
Everything I teach you...

388
00:23:32,048 --> 00:23:33,716
...has a good reason.

389
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:38,513
Love, my dear Gigi...

390
00:23:38,888 --> 00:23:42,100
...is a thing of beauty,
like a work of art.

391
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:46,145
And like a work of art,
it is created by artists.

392
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:50,233
The greater the artist,
the greater the art.

393
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,362
And what makes an artist?

394
00:23:54,988 --> 00:23:56,864
Cigars and jewelry?

395
00:23:59,867 --> 00:24:02,161
You are from another planet.

396
00:24:03,121 --> 00:24:04,747
Get on with your work.

397
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:20,263
<i>A necklace is love</i>

398
00:24:21,014 --> 00:24:22,390
<i>A ring is love</i>

399
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:26,728
<i>A rock from some obnoxious little king
Is love</i>

400
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,939
<i>A sapphire with a star is love</i>

401
00:24:31,107 --> 00:24:33,359
<i>An ugly black cigar is love</i>

402
00:24:34,485 --> 00:24:36,738
<i>Everything you are is love</i>

403
00:24:37,405 --> 00:24:40,450
<i>You would think it would embarrass
All the people here in Paris</i>

404
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,202
<i>To be thinking every minute of love</i>

405
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,964
<i>I don't understand the Parisians</i>

406
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,635
<i>Making love every time
They get a chance</i>

407
00:25:00,345 --> 00:25:03,181
<i>I don't understand the Parisians</i>

408
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,060
<i>Wasting every lovely night on romance</i>

409
00:25:08,227 --> 00:25:09,228
<i>Anytime</i>

410
00:25:09,479 --> 00:25:11,439
<i>And under every tree in town</i>

411
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:14,734
<i>They're in session two by two</i>

412
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,195
<i>What a crime</i>

413
00:25:17,445 --> 00:25:19,697
<i>With all there is to see in town</i>

414
00:25:20,448 --> 00:25:22,992
<i>They can't find something else to do</i>

415
00:25:24,202 --> 00:25:27,288
<i>I don't understand how Parisians</i>

416
00:25:28,164 --> 00:25:30,833
<i>Never tire of walking hand in hand</i>

417
00:25:32,418 --> 00:25:34,254
<i>But they seem to love it</i>

418
00:25:34,504 --> 00:25:36,214
<i>And speak highly of it</i>

419
00:25:36,464 --> 00:25:37,924
<i>I don't understand</i>

420
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,427
<i>The Parisians!</i>

421
00:25:48,601 --> 00:25:51,062
I don't understand the Parisians!

422
00:26:06,077 --> 00:26:07,120
<i>When it's warm</i>

423
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,706
<i>They take a carriage ride at night</i>

424
00:26:10,581 --> 00:26:13,167
<i>Close their eyes and hug and kiss</i>

425
00:26:14,085 --> 00:26:15,044
<i>When it's cold</i>

426
00:26:15,295 --> 00:26:17,255
<i>They simply move inside at night</i>

427
00:26:18,381 --> 00:26:20,967
<i>There must be more to life than this</i>

428
00:26:22,176 --> 00:26:25,263
<i>I don't understand the Parisians</i>

429
00:26:26,097 --> 00:26:28,891
<i>Thinking love so miraculous and grand</i>

430
00:26:30,393 --> 00:26:32,020
<i>But they rave about it</i>

431
00:26:32,395 --> 00:26:34,063
<i>And won't live without it</i>

432
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:35,773
<i>I don't understand</i>

433
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:39,652
<i>The Parisians!</i>

434
00:26:42,572 --> 00:26:43,573
Stop.

435
00:26:51,748 --> 00:26:53,374
What are you doing there?

436
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:57,045
Gaston...

437
00:26:58,046 --> 00:26:59,672
...do you make love all the time?

438
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:00,840
I beg your pardon?

439
00:27:01,049 --> 00:27:03,301
- Do you make love all the time?
- Heavens, no.

440
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:06,512
The only people who make love
all the time are liars.

441
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:08,932
Was that the subject
of your lesson today?

442
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,894
- How did you know I was having a lesson?
- I just came from your house.

443
00:27:13,811 --> 00:27:17,440
Too bad I wasn't there. We could've
played cards, and I could've beaten you.

444
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:18,983
But you cheat.

445
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,486
I can, but with you,
I don't have to.

446
00:27:21,694 --> 00:27:23,446
You watch your tongue, my girl.

447
00:27:23,613 --> 00:27:25,615
- I'm not your girl.
- Thank you for that.

448
00:27:25,823 --> 00:27:29,994
If I have a little girl, I'll see
to it she's more respectful than you.

449
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,454
- Come with me.
- Where?

450
00:27:31,621 --> 00:27:32,705
- To the Ice Palace.
- I don't skate.

451
00:27:32,872 --> 00:27:33,998
- I'll buy you a drink.
- I don't drink.

452
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:35,750
- A sweet one.
- Are you going to skate?

453
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,170
No, but I'm calling
for Madame d'Exelmans.

454
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:40,964
Liane? Your lady love?

455
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:43,800
No, thank you.
I've had enough of that for today.

456
00:27:44,008 --> 00:27:45,677
I'm not going to woo her on ice.

457
00:27:45,843 --> 00:27:47,762
Come along before I spank you.

458
00:27:48,012 --> 00:27:49,264
You wouldn't dare!

459
00:27:49,472 --> 00:27:50,974
Oh, I wouldn't, eh?

460
00:28:22,046 --> 00:28:23,172
Sit down.

461
00:28:25,258 --> 00:28:26,551
Sit down.

462
00:28:27,302 --> 00:28:29,304
Haven't you ever seen
an ice rink?

463
00:28:29,512 --> 00:28:30,555
Never.

464
00:28:31,097 --> 00:28:35,101
Grandmama says going out distracts one
from more serious matters.

465
00:28:36,102 --> 00:28:37,520
<i>A barbotage for the lady.</i>

466
00:28:37,729 --> 00:28:39,272
- What's that?
- Quiet.

467
00:28:39,522 --> 00:28:41,399
Champagne for me. Well-iced.

468
00:28:41,608 --> 00:28:42,859
Yes, Monsieur Lachaille.

469
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:49,490
Is that the scandalous
Madame d'Exelmans?

470
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:52,702
Yes, that's she.

471
00:28:56,623 --> 00:28:59,375
Tell me, Gigi, the way
you express yourself...

472
00:28:59,584 --> 00:29:02,337
...does your grandmother
ever hear you talk this way?

473
00:29:02,545 --> 00:29:04,130
She never listens to me much.

474
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:08,092
Which reminds me, she mustn't know
I was here with you.

475
00:29:08,301 --> 00:29:11,262
And why not?
What's wrong with being with me?

476
00:29:11,512 --> 00:29:12,931
It isn't you. It's here.

477
00:29:13,181 --> 00:29:15,767
I told you.
This isn't serious matters.

478
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:19,395
And just what are serious matters?

479
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:22,148
I don't remember it all by heart.

480
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,567
One mustn't read novels;
they depress you.

481
00:29:24,776 --> 00:29:26,903
Don't wear powder;
it ruins the complexion.

482
00:29:27,153 --> 00:29:30,073
Don't wear corsets;
they spoil the figure.

483
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:40,041
What do you think of Liane?

484
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:42,252
She's pretty.

485
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,878
Yes, she is.

486
00:29:44,128 --> 00:29:45,255
But...

487
00:29:45,838 --> 00:29:47,131
But what?

488
00:29:47,924 --> 00:29:49,133
Common.

489
00:29:49,926 --> 00:29:51,094
Common?

490
00:29:53,805 --> 00:29:57,850
How do you mean "common"?
Ordinary common or coarse common?

491
00:29:58,643 --> 00:29:59,852
Ordinary.

492
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,815
And coarse. Well, I really must go.
Please come soon.

493
00:30:04,065 --> 00:30:06,734
- Thank you for the drink.
- It was a pleasure.

494
00:30:13,157 --> 00:30:14,492
Hello, my darling.

495
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,453
You waltz divinely.

496
00:30:17,704 --> 00:30:19,122
Thank you, my love.

497
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:24,252
I'll let you know
when I'll be in for my next lesson.

498
00:30:24,502 --> 00:30:25,753
Yes, madame.

499
00:30:26,004 --> 00:30:27,964
I thought we'd meet Honoré
at Maxim's and...

500
00:30:28,131 --> 00:30:29,257
Darling.

501
00:30:36,514 --> 00:30:37,682
At Maxim's?

502
00:30:37,932 --> 00:30:40,310
Thank you... monsieur.

503
00:30:42,478 --> 00:30:43,855
Dreadful man.

504
00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:46,316
You seem to have lessons
with him often enough.

505
00:30:46,566 --> 00:30:49,485
He's an excellent teacher.
I made amazing progress.

506
00:30:49,736 --> 00:30:53,990
But he's so conceited.
So superior in an inferior way.

507
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,575
I can't stand him.

508
00:30:55,825 --> 00:30:57,160
Shall we go?

509
00:31:06,961 --> 00:31:10,840
Gaston and Liane are joining me
here at Maxim's tonight.

510
00:31:12,383 --> 00:31:13,968
I'm giving a small party...

511
00:31:14,218 --> 00:31:17,972
...in honor of a heavenly creature
I met this afternoon.

512
00:31:19,223 --> 00:31:20,224
She's...
Pardon me.

513
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:22,852
She's the sister
of the heavenly creature...

514
00:31:23,102 --> 00:31:25,229
...I gave a party for last night.

515
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:28,983
What a marvelous place Maxim's is!

516
00:31:29,233 --> 00:31:32,528
Not only gay and beautiful,
but in one thing unique:

517
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:35,907
In Maxim's, everybody minds
his own business.

518
00:31:36,157 --> 00:31:40,662
No one is the slightest bit interested
in whom one is with.

519
00:31:54,217 --> 00:31:56,803
<i>There's that wretched man
Louis de Latour</i>

520
00:31:57,512 --> 00:32:00,098
<i>With his latest horrible amour</i>

521
00:32:00,765 --> 00:32:03,518
<i>Isn't she a mess
Isn't she a sight</i>

522
00:32:04,018 --> 00:32:06,437
<i>Let's invite them out tomorrow night</i>

523
00:32:20,076 --> 00:32:22,495
<i>Honoré Lachaille
Honoré Lachaille</i>

524
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:25,748
<i>With another twinkle in his eye</i>

525
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:29,335
<i>Isn't it a shame
Isn't it a crime</i>

526
00:32:29,877 --> 00:32:32,088
<i>Seeing him so happy all the time</i>

527
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:46,394
<i>There's Gaston Lachaille
With his little friend</i>

528
00:32:47,228 --> 00:32:49,814
<i>Is that passion never going to end</i>

529
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:53,151
<i>Did you see her ring?
Not a bagatelle</i>

530
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:55,820
<i>Dear Liane is doing very well</i>

531
00:33:28,978 --> 00:33:31,230
<i>She's a lovable one tonight, isn't she?</i>

532
00:33:31,481 --> 00:33:33,608
<i>What is she up to?</i>

533
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:37,153
<i>She's so gay tonight</i>

534
00:33:37,737 --> 00:33:39,322
<i>She's like spring tonight</i>

535
00:33:39,822 --> 00:33:42,742
<i>She's a rollicking
Frolicking thing tonight</i>

536
00:33:43,076 --> 00:33:45,954
<i>So disarming
Soft and charming</i>

537
00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:48,706
<i>She is not thinking of me</i>

538
00:33:49,832 --> 00:33:52,001
<i>No, she's not thinking of me</i>

539
00:33:53,461 --> 00:33:54,879
<i>In her eyes tonight</i>

540
00:33:55,171 --> 00:33:56,631
<i>There's a glow tonight</i>

541
00:33:56,965 --> 00:34:00,051
<i>They're so bright they could light
Fontainebleau tonight</i>

542
00:34:00,426 --> 00:34:02,929
<i>She's so gracious
So vivacious</i>

543
00:34:03,805 --> 00:34:06,224
<i>She is not thinking of me</i>

544
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:08,768
<i>Bless her little heart</i>

545
00:34:10,979 --> 00:34:12,438
<i>Crooked to the core</i>

546
00:34:14,524 --> 00:34:15,900
<i>Acting out a part</i>

547
00:34:18,486 --> 00:34:20,697
<i>What a rollicking, frolicking bore!</i>

548
00:34:21,864 --> 00:34:23,491
<i>She's such fun tonight</i>

549
00:34:23,908 --> 00:34:25,285
<i>She's a treat tonight</i>

550
00:34:25,743 --> 00:34:28,997
<i>You could spread her on bread
She's so sweet tonight</i>

551
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:31,457
<i>So devoted
Sugarcoated</i>

552
00:34:32,458 --> 00:34:35,128
<i>That it's heartwarming to see</i>

553
00:34:36,045 --> 00:34:37,839
<i>Oh, she's simmering with love</i>

554
00:34:38,047 --> 00:34:39,674
<i>Oh, she's shimmering with love</i>

555
00:34:39,882 --> 00:34:42,635
<i>Oh, she's not thinking of me</i>

556
00:35:00,236 --> 00:35:02,905
<i>She is not thinking of me</i>

557
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,492
<i>Someone has set her on fire</i>

558
00:35:07,327 --> 00:35:09,662
<i>Is it Jacques, is it Paul or Léon?</i>

559
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,583
<i>Who's turning her furnace up higher?</i>

560
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,961
<i>Oh, she's hot
But it's not for Gaston!</i>

561
00:35:17,921 --> 00:35:20,048
<i>Oh, she's gay tonight</i>

562
00:35:20,715 --> 00:35:22,050
<i>Oh so gay tonight</i>

563
00:35:22,508 --> 00:35:25,303
<i>A gigantic romantic cliché tonight</i>

564
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,514
<i>How she blushes
How she gushes</i>

565
00:35:29,015 --> 00:35:31,267
<i>How she fills me with ennui</i>

566
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:34,228
<i>She's so ooh la la la la</i>

567
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:35,980
<i>So untrue la la la la</i>

568
00:35:36,314 --> 00:35:38,942
<i>Oh, she's not thinking of me</i>

569
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:49,535
I knew she was up to something.

570
00:35:49,786 --> 00:35:52,580
I knew it. There had to be
a reason for last night.

571
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:54,499
But what was I to do?

572
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,335
Trail after her? Spy on her?

573
00:35:57,585 --> 00:36:00,088
- Sniff around like a bloodhound?
- Of course not.

574
00:36:00,338 --> 00:36:02,799
Heaven knows, I'm not jealous.
Thank you for that.

575
00:36:03,049 --> 00:36:04,425
Why should I follow her?

576
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:06,928
No reason at all.
What did you do?

577
00:36:07,262 --> 00:36:08,680
I hired detectives.

578
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,266
And the results are nauseating.

579
00:36:11,516 --> 00:36:16,229
The Riverton Agencyjust telephoned me
that she and her oily acrobat...

580
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:21,067
...arrived a half an hour ago
in a cozy little inn at Honfleur.

581
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:22,193
Well.

582
00:36:22,443 --> 00:36:23,695
Without skates.

583
00:36:23,987 --> 00:36:25,446
Most disagreeable.

584
00:36:25,863 --> 00:36:28,283
Come, my boy.
You're not the first.

585
00:36:28,825 --> 00:36:30,618
This sort of thing
has happened before.

586
00:36:30,868 --> 00:36:32,370
And to some very good people.

587
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:35,623
Alfred de Musset,
Victor Hugo, Napoleon.

588
00:36:35,915 --> 00:36:38,167
Even to me.
Isn't that true, Manuel?

589
00:36:38,334 --> 00:36:41,004
Yes, indeed, sir.
Many, many, many times.

590
00:36:41,254 --> 00:36:42,547
Well, not that many.

591
00:36:43,464 --> 00:36:45,216
But a skating instructor.

592
00:36:46,009 --> 00:36:47,427
A skating instructor!

593
00:36:47,677 --> 00:36:49,887
It is always a skating instructor.

594
00:36:50,221 --> 00:36:51,806
Or some such specimen.

595
00:36:52,098 --> 00:36:54,809
- Isn't that true, Manuel?
- Absolutely, sir.

596
00:36:55,226 --> 00:36:57,604
Remember dear little
Madame Dumelle...

597
00:36:58,396 --> 00:37:00,565
...and Marmaluc the Terrible Turk?

598
00:37:00,815 --> 00:37:01,941
There you are.

599
00:37:02,275 --> 00:37:04,152
A wrestler from the Folies Bergère.

600
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:07,030
There was Madame Laura
and the swimming coach.

601
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,531
Hurry up, Manuel.

602
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,576
And Madame d'A lbert
and the riding master.

603
00:37:11,826 --> 00:37:13,369
Mademoiselle Monique
and the weight lifter...

604
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,663
...Madame Bocher and the plumber.

605
00:37:15,997 --> 00:37:18,207
That's enough, Manuel.
You've made your point.

606
00:37:18,416 --> 00:37:20,126
Here, put this in your mouth.

607
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,339
One can't be a Don Juan
to one's valet, can one?

608
00:37:24,714 --> 00:37:28,217
I only keep him to prevent him
from talking to others.

609
00:37:28,509 --> 00:37:30,803
Oh, come, Gaston, cheer up.

610
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,724
Cheer up? I couldn't be
in better spirits.

611
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:37,477
Good. I'm delighted
the deadly affair is over.

612
00:37:37,727 --> 00:37:40,855
The woman was common.
Plainly and unmistakably common...

613
00:37:41,064 --> 00:37:44,067
...from her painted toenails
to the top of her bleached head.

614
00:37:44,275 --> 00:37:46,945
I'm glad to be rid of her.
What do we do today?

615
00:37:48,821 --> 00:37:50,156
What do we do?

616
00:37:51,032 --> 00:37:52,909
We're going to Honfleur, naturally.

617
00:37:53,117 --> 00:37:55,662
Are you mad?
I never want to see her again.

618
00:37:56,537 --> 00:37:57,580
Of course you don't.

619
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:00,750
But you're not going to
let a woman have the last word.

620
00:38:00,959 --> 00:38:02,752
Where is your sense of honor?

621
00:38:03,002 --> 00:38:04,671
Your male patriotism?

622
00:38:04,921 --> 00:38:05,755
Nonsense.

623
00:38:05,964 --> 00:38:09,592
Listen to your uncle, Monsieur Gaston.
He's an old campaigner.

624
00:38:09,842 --> 00:38:11,177
How would you end it?

625
00:38:12,095 --> 00:38:13,263
I'll write her a note.

626
00:38:15,181 --> 00:38:19,227
There is no way of writing it
without it reeking of wounded pride.

627
00:38:19,435 --> 00:38:21,271
Victor Hugo couldn't pull it off.

628
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,940
Then I'll telephone her.

629
00:38:24,274 --> 00:38:25,692
And what would you say?

630
00:38:25,942 --> 00:38:29,946
"Liane, you deceived me
with a skating instructor.

631
00:38:30,196 --> 00:38:32,115
I never want to see you again."

632
00:38:33,241 --> 00:38:35,868
You'll sound like
ajealous schoolboy.

633
00:38:36,494 --> 00:38:37,996
That's impossible.

634
00:38:38,538 --> 00:38:39,872
That's true.

635
00:38:40,957 --> 00:38:42,917
That's true.
What do I do?

636
00:38:43,293 --> 00:38:46,296
You go to Honfleur
and throw her out like a man.

637
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:48,047
That's a bore.

638
00:38:48,548 --> 00:38:50,466
A bore? Not at all.

639
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:52,135
It's pride.

640
00:38:53,052 --> 00:38:54,637
<i>Just imagine your chagrin</i>

641
00:38:54,887 --> 00:38:56,556
<i>When she sees you wander in</i>

642
00:38:56,806 --> 00:38:58,975
<i>And you find her
With that slippery señor</i>

643
00:39:00,018 --> 00:39:01,352
<i>What a moment supreme</i>

644
00:39:01,603 --> 00:39:03,187
<i>When she totters with a scream</i>

645
00:39:03,396 --> 00:39:04,689
- What will she do?
- Scream.

646
00:39:04,939 --> 00:39:06,524
- What did yours do?
- Scream.

647
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:08,610
- What do they all do?
- Scream.

648
00:39:08,818 --> 00:39:10,320
<i>It's a bore</i>

649
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:11,988
<i>But think of the bliss</i>

650
00:39:12,238 --> 00:39:13,656
<i>Of the pleasure you would miss</i>

651
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,533
<i>When she topples in a heap</i>

652
00:39:15,783 --> 00:39:18,536
<i>And you leave her there to weep
On the floor</i>

653
00:39:19,078 --> 00:39:20,371
<i>It's a bore</i>

654
00:39:20,747 --> 00:39:22,415
<i>You must catch her if you can</i>

655
00:39:22,665 --> 00:39:24,083
<i>For the dignity of man</i>

656
00:39:24,334 --> 00:39:25,960
<i>Take advantage of the chance</i>

657
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,630
<i>You owe it, sir, to France
This is war!</i>

658
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:30,590
<i>All right</i>

659
00:39:31,049 --> 00:39:32,467
<i>But it's a bore</i>

660
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:51,027
Turn it around and leave it there.

661
00:40:10,964 --> 00:40:12,215
They are there.

662
00:40:25,144 --> 00:40:27,522
Terrible-looking rodent, isn't he?

663
00:40:28,022 --> 00:40:29,774
Terrible, but typical.

664
00:40:30,233 --> 00:40:32,151
Those chaps all look alike.

665
00:40:33,736 --> 00:40:35,947
She looks older in the daylight.

666
00:40:36,698 --> 00:40:39,450
Much older.
I don't envy him.

667
00:40:39,701 --> 00:40:40,785
Neither do I.

668
00:40:43,413 --> 00:40:44,747
She never kissed me like that.

669
00:40:44,998 --> 00:40:47,083
- How is she kissing him?
- Wholeheartedly.

670
00:40:47,292 --> 00:40:48,334
What do you expect?

671
00:40:48,585 --> 00:40:51,254
You're legitimate.
He's forbidden fruit.

672
00:40:51,504 --> 00:40:52,922
When do we make our move?

673
00:40:53,172 --> 00:40:54,048
Wait, wait.

674
00:40:59,512 --> 00:41:00,555
Come on.

675
00:41:09,188 --> 00:41:11,899
Monsieur Lachaille, what a surprise.
I am honored.

676
00:41:12,108 --> 00:41:13,359
Don't be.
Come on, get up!

677
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,487
Wait, wait!
You are making a mistake.

678
00:41:16,738 --> 00:41:20,825
It was just a coincidence,
my meeting madame here.

679
00:41:21,034 --> 00:41:22,702
It was a coincidence,
I suppose...

680
00:41:22,952 --> 00:41:24,871
...that your lips
just happened to meet...

681
00:41:25,121 --> 00:41:26,664
...in a long, ardent, passionate...

682
00:41:26,915 --> 00:41:28,166
You keep out of this.

683
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:32,045
I don't want any discussions.
For 1000 francs, this never happened.

684
00:41:32,337 --> 00:41:35,006
You leave the Ice Palace
and disappear. Forever.

685
00:41:35,256 --> 00:41:36,674
- But...
- No "buts."

686
00:41:36,883 --> 00:41:38,760
You're coming with us now.

687
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,845
We'll take you to
the nearest railroad station.

688
00:41:41,054 --> 00:41:42,305
1000 francs?

689
00:42:08,998 --> 00:42:11,918
There is nothing more to be said.
Goodbye, madame.

690
00:42:12,126 --> 00:42:15,046
From the bottom of my heart, goodbye.

691
00:42:18,967 --> 00:42:20,385
Gaston, my love.

692
00:42:43,032 --> 00:42:44,075
What happened?

693
00:42:44,284 --> 00:42:47,578
Liane d'Exelmans has committed suicide.
Again!

694
00:42:48,913 --> 00:42:50,999
I'm sorry, girl.
What did you say?

695
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:55,795
I didn't know he left her.

696
00:42:56,963 --> 00:42:58,798
My word!

697
00:43:00,592 --> 00:43:01,759
Of course.

698
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:05,388
Call me as soon as you hear anything.
Anything at all.

699
00:43:06,097 --> 00:43:07,515
How marvelous!

700
00:43:07,849 --> 00:43:09,475
Paris agog.

701
00:43:09,767 --> 00:43:12,645
Why didn't you tell me that Gaston
and Liane had broken up?

702
00:43:12,895 --> 00:43:16,024
I didn't know it.
It must've happened over the weekend.

703
00:43:16,274 --> 00:43:17,817
When was the suicide?

704
00:43:18,026 --> 00:43:19,902
- Last night.
- How did she do it?

705
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:22,780
The usual way,
insufficient poison.

706
00:43:23,072 --> 00:43:24,824
Say, how many times
has she done it now?

707
00:43:25,116 --> 00:43:26,075
Good evening, Manuel.

708
00:43:27,285 --> 00:43:28,328
Good evening, Honoré.

709
00:43:29,037 --> 00:43:30,747
Gaston, my boy.

710
00:43:31,748 --> 00:43:33,291
Congratulations.

711
00:43:33,625 --> 00:43:35,335
Your first suicide.

712
00:43:35,543 --> 00:43:38,755
What an achievement.
And at your age.

713
00:43:39,047 --> 00:43:41,633
Like everyone in Paris,
we were just talking about you.

714
00:43:41,883 --> 00:43:43,468
Thank you, Honoré.
I came over to...

715
00:43:43,718 --> 00:43:44,886
May I add mine, sir?

716
00:43:45,094 --> 00:43:47,221
Thank you, Manuel.
I came over to get a...

717
00:43:47,472 --> 00:43:48,890
It was a stunning victory.

718
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,350
- Where is the champagne?
- It's ready, sir.

719
00:43:50,558 --> 00:43:53,519
I came over to get away
from the telephone.

720
00:43:53,937 --> 00:43:56,898
I can imagine.
Any news from the corpse?

721
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:00,610
Fully recovered, according to
late morning editions.

722
00:44:00,902 --> 00:44:02,278
And how do you feel?

723
00:44:02,528 --> 00:44:04,530
Oddly enough, I'm not quite sure.

724
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:05,740
Make a guess.

725
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:07,784
Well, I'd say edgy.

726
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:09,535
Edgy?

727
00:44:09,786 --> 00:44:12,080
Almost depressed. I don't know why.

728
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:13,957
There must be a reason.

729
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,209
I suppose it's to be expected.

730
00:44:16,459 --> 00:44:20,755
<i>I'm told Verdi felt that way after
the first performance of Aida.</i>

731
00:44:21,214 --> 00:44:23,841
- Get a glass for yourself.
- I have one, sir.

732
00:44:25,218 --> 00:44:26,511
To you, Gaston.

733
00:44:26,803 --> 00:44:30,098
May this be the first of many.

734
00:44:36,854 --> 00:44:39,440
What about tonight?
Where do we go? What do we do?

735
00:44:39,691 --> 00:44:43,319
I don't know. I should consider
what I do next very carefully.

736
00:44:43,528 --> 00:44:48,157
I've been weighing the idea of
going to the country for a while.

737
00:44:49,325 --> 00:44:51,869
You mean, leave Paris?

738
00:44:52,078 --> 00:44:53,621
Yes. Why not?

739
00:44:53,997 --> 00:44:55,456
Why not?

740
00:44:55,707 --> 00:44:57,834
That's the one thing
you mustn't do.

741
00:44:58,167 --> 00:45:01,629
Do you want people to think
you're despondent? Disturbed?

742
00:45:02,046 --> 00:45:03,923
If you leave, they will, you know.

743
00:45:04,132 --> 00:45:08,845
No, no. That would be snatching
defeat from the jaws of victory.

744
00:45:09,262 --> 00:45:13,600
No, no, no. For the next few weeks,
you should be out every night.

745
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:15,893
Maxim's, Moulin Rouge,
Pre Catalan.

746
00:45:16,144 --> 00:45:17,520
The Pre Catalan is closed.

747
00:45:17,729 --> 00:45:20,064
Open it!
You must be carefree.

748
00:45:20,481 --> 00:45:22,191
Devil-may-care.

749
00:45:22,942 --> 00:45:26,821
A different girl every night.
Keep them guessing who's next.

750
00:45:27,071 --> 00:45:28,823
Play the game.
Be gay...

751
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:31,659
...extravagant, outrageous.

752
00:47:12,635 --> 00:47:13,761
Grandmama!

753
00:47:14,304 --> 00:47:16,764
Lmagine. Gaston bought out
the opera last night...

754
00:47:17,015 --> 00:47:21,144
...and brought the entire company
to his house for a performance.

755
00:47:22,812 --> 00:47:23,980
I'll go.

756
00:47:28,568 --> 00:47:31,279
Gaston, how are you?
You look all in.

757
00:47:31,654 --> 00:47:34,198
- Is your grandmother home?
- Yes, she is.

758
00:47:34,657 --> 00:47:35,908
Is that gold?

759
00:47:36,451 --> 00:47:37,702
The handle, yes.

760
00:47:37,952 --> 00:47:40,288
You must be very rich to have
a gold handle on your cane.

761
00:47:40,538 --> 00:47:42,373
Gaston, what a nice surprise.

762
00:47:42,665 --> 00:47:44,250
Don't let me disturb you, Mamita.

763
00:47:44,542 --> 00:47:46,419
I was just preparing dinner.

764
00:47:47,003 --> 00:47:49,005
Smells awfully good.

765
00:47:49,756 --> 00:47:52,008
It's just a pork cassoulet.

766
00:47:53,176 --> 00:47:56,721
It was impossible to
get any goose this week.

767
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:00,058
I'll have them send you
a brace from the country.

768
00:48:01,768 --> 00:48:03,353
I brought you some caramels.

769
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:05,188
Thank you, Gaston.

770
00:48:05,563 --> 00:48:07,482
Gaston, you spoil her so.

771
00:48:08,691 --> 00:48:10,735
The champagne is for you.

772
00:48:13,237 --> 00:48:15,740
You spoil me too.

773
00:48:17,617 --> 00:48:19,118
Be careful.
You'll ruin your hands.

774
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:21,079
I have a manicure every morning.

775
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:22,789
What a nuisance.

776
00:48:27,168 --> 00:48:29,087
- Not like that.
- No?

777
00:48:29,295 --> 00:48:30,338
Like this.

778
00:48:30,588 --> 00:48:31,673
All right.

779
00:48:34,342 --> 00:48:37,303
- Where are you going with that tie?
- Let's not talk about it.

780
00:48:37,553 --> 00:48:40,682
I'm having a small party
for 200 at the Eiffel Tower.

781
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:44,310
- Are you going away?
- Yes, for the weekend. Trouville.

782
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:47,939
A little sea air before the
next round of parties.

783
00:48:48,189 --> 00:48:50,733
- Is Trouville by the sea?
- Yes, you little idiot.

784
00:48:50,942 --> 00:48:53,528
You expect to find sea air
in the mountains?

785
00:48:53,778 --> 00:48:56,698
Don't make fun of me.
I've never been to the ocean.

786
00:48:57,615 --> 00:49:00,118
What will you eat
for dinner tonight?

787
00:49:01,786 --> 00:49:04,497
Filet of sole with mussels,
for a change.

788
00:49:05,915 --> 00:49:08,167
And a lamb filet with truffles.

789
00:49:08,585 --> 00:49:11,296
It's always the same.
It can't compare...

790
00:49:12,088 --> 00:49:14,257
...with your grandmother's cassoulet.

791
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:18,428
Why don't you stay
and have some with us?

792
00:49:21,514 --> 00:49:23,516
- I wish I could.
- Why not?

793
00:49:27,186 --> 00:49:29,397
All right, I will.

794
00:49:29,981 --> 00:49:31,899
But people are waiting for you.

795
00:49:32,108 --> 00:49:35,486
My car's downstairs. I'll send
the chauffeur with my apologies.

796
00:49:35,695 --> 00:49:36,988
My uncle will be the host.

797
00:49:37,238 --> 00:49:39,532
Honoré? He'll do it very well.

798
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,579
I'm dying to take a ride
in your beautiful automobile.

799
00:49:45,538 --> 00:49:46,915
Let me deliver it.

800
00:49:47,206 --> 00:49:48,583
If you want to.

801
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:51,920
Tell the chauffeur to take this
to my uncle's house.

802
00:49:53,212 --> 00:49:54,714
- Go quickly.
- Thank you.

803
00:49:55,089 --> 00:49:57,258
I can't wait to see
the face of the janitress.

804
00:49:57,508 --> 00:50:00,470
And after dinner, we'll have
a serious game of cards.

805
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,221
And I'll beat you, as usual.

806
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:04,349
And you'll cheat, as usual.

807
00:50:10,229 --> 00:50:12,815
Gaston, Gigi takes advantage of you.

808
00:50:13,066 --> 00:50:15,151
Let her, let her, Mamita.

809
00:50:15,401 --> 00:50:16,736
It amuses me.

810
00:50:27,664 --> 00:50:29,457
How is Honoré these days?

811
00:50:29,832 --> 00:50:31,167
The same.

812
00:50:31,417 --> 00:50:33,836
A life devoted to the chase.

813
00:50:34,295 --> 00:50:38,258
We've missed you, Gaston.
We haven't seen you since the suicide.

814
00:50:38,508 --> 00:50:40,969
Yes, I've had quite a
full schedule lately.

815
00:50:41,636 --> 00:50:42,762
So I've read.

816
00:50:43,012 --> 00:50:46,891
You always do things
in the grand manner.

817
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,019
Your parties have
filled the newspapers.

818
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:53,564
Sometimes the cure is more
painful than the illness.

819
00:50:53,773 --> 00:50:56,484
But I have to do it.
It's expected of me.

820
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:58,403
Poor Gaston.

821
00:50:59,195 --> 00:51:01,614
You're in a difficult position,
aren't you?

822
00:51:02,323 --> 00:51:04,576
Yes, Mamita, yes.
Very difficult.

823
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,079
See, the whole of Paris
is watching me.

824
00:51:08,329 --> 00:51:10,290
What are you talking of?

825
00:51:10,957 --> 00:51:13,418
The whole world is watching you.

826
00:51:15,628 --> 00:51:18,172
Yes, it's quite a responsibility.

827
00:51:19,841 --> 00:51:21,593
Quite a responsibility.

828
00:51:30,727 --> 00:51:32,145
Discard two.

829
00:51:34,439 --> 00:51:36,232
Ten pounds of sugar.

830
00:51:37,317 --> 00:51:41,446
Those aren't very high stakes.
Your sugar isn't that good.

831
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:43,323
I'd rather play you for candy.

832
00:51:43,573 --> 00:51:46,743
It's the same thing,
only sugar is healthier.

833
00:51:47,243 --> 00:51:48,828
You just say that
because you make it.

834
00:51:49,037 --> 00:51:51,664
Gigi, I heard that.
Where are your manners?

835
00:51:51,873 --> 00:51:53,750
It's all right, Mamita.
It's all right.

836
00:51:57,629 --> 00:52:01,466
If I lose, what would you really like?
Silk stockings?

837
00:52:01,716 --> 00:52:04,260
No. Silk stockings
make my legs itch.

838
00:52:04,636 --> 00:52:05,470
I discard one.

839
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,765
What I would really like
is a Nile green corset...

840
00:52:09,015 --> 00:52:11,976
...with rococo roses embroidered
on the garters.

841
00:52:14,646 --> 00:52:17,398
Or a new role for the player piano.

842
00:52:19,108 --> 00:52:20,151
Or...

843
00:52:20,818 --> 00:52:21,861
Or what?

844
00:52:22,236 --> 00:52:23,696
A look at the ocean.

845
00:52:25,323 --> 00:52:26,157
All right.

846
00:52:26,407 --> 00:52:29,911
If I lose, I'll take
you and Mamita to Trouville.

847
00:52:30,703 --> 00:52:32,372
I heard that too.

848
00:52:38,086 --> 00:52:40,255
Don't worry, Gaston.

849
00:52:41,464 --> 00:52:46,177
Win or lose, Gigi, you will not impose
us on poor Gaston for the weekend.

850
00:52:46,386 --> 00:52:48,221
May I have a glass of champagne?

851
00:52:48,471 --> 00:52:51,724
Are you losing your mind?
Of course you may not.

852
00:53:03,236 --> 00:53:04,821
Discard three.

853
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:11,119
Discard one.

854
00:53:13,371 --> 00:53:14,706
Now, let's see.

855
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,669
Cards are a matter of logic.

856
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,549
I know what I have...

857
00:53:24,966 --> 00:53:27,677
...and I know how many you've drawn.

858
00:53:28,219 --> 00:53:32,432
According to the percentages,
you undoubtedly have an ace.

859
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:36,394
You discarded a 10
and a five...

860
00:53:36,603 --> 00:53:38,104
...and a queen...

861
00:53:38,313 --> 00:53:39,689
...and a three.

862
00:53:41,858 --> 00:53:44,277
You, therefore, must have two aces.

863
00:53:45,153 --> 00:53:48,114
Two aces and something smaller.

864
00:53:48,364 --> 00:53:50,700
That's very interesting.

865
00:53:53,745 --> 00:53:54,787
Therefore...

866
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:56,998
...I win.

867
00:53:57,832 --> 00:54:00,209
And therefore, you lose.

868
00:54:01,628 --> 00:54:04,631
But you cheated.
Where did you get that fourth king?

869
00:54:04,923 --> 00:54:06,466
I won, I won, I won!

870
00:54:06,716 --> 00:54:09,218
Why, you gypsy!
You thief!

871
00:54:09,469 --> 00:54:11,554
You're a muttonhead.
Do we go to Trouville?

872
00:54:11,804 --> 00:54:13,973
Yes, yes. You go to Trouville.

873
00:54:14,724 --> 00:54:16,976
Grandmama, we go to Trouville.

874
00:54:17,393 --> 00:54:19,020
It's out of the question.

875
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:21,773
Not at all. I'd love it.
Believe it or not...

876
00:54:21,981 --> 00:54:24,609
...I have a better time
with this outrageous brat...

877
00:54:24,859 --> 00:54:27,612
...than anybody in Paris.
It'll be marvelous fun.

878
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:30,907
<i>What time tomorrow will we get there?
Can I watch you play roulette?</i>

879
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:34,369
<i>May I stay up late for supper?
Is it awfully, awfully upper?</i>

880
00:54:34,661 --> 00:54:36,454
<i>Gigi, you'll drive us wild</i>

881
00:54:37,705 --> 00:54:39,582
<i>Stop, you silly child</i>

882
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:44,254
<i>Is everybody celebrated
Full of sin and dissipated?</i>

883
00:54:44,587 --> 00:54:47,674
<i>Is it hot enough to blister?
Will I be your little sister?</i>

884
00:54:47,882 --> 00:54:50,093
<i>Gigi, you are absurd</i>

885
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:52,762
<i>Now, not another word</i>

886
00:54:54,347 --> 00:54:55,765
<i>Let her gush and jabber</i>

887
00:54:56,057 --> 00:54:57,350
<i>Let her be enthused</i>

888
00:54:57,684 --> 00:55:01,521
<i>I cannot remember
When I have been more amused</i>

889
00:55:02,313 --> 00:55:05,483
<i>- Stop it!
- The night they invented champagne</i>

890
00:55:06,025 --> 00:55:07,485
<i>It's plain as it can be</i>

891
00:55:07,735 --> 00:55:09,279
<i>They thought of you and me</i>

892
00:55:09,529 --> 00:55:11,656
<i>The night they invented champagne</i>

893
00:55:12,949 --> 00:55:14,075
<i>They absolutely knew</i>

894
00:55:14,576 --> 00:55:15,952
<i>That all we'd want to do</i>

895
00:55:16,286 --> 00:55:18,246
<i>Is fly to the sky on champagne</i>

896
00:55:19,539 --> 00:55:21,833
<i>And shout to everyone in sight</i>

897
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:26,296
<i>That since the world began
No woman or a man</i>

898
00:55:26,879 --> 00:55:30,550
<i>Has ever been as happy
As we are tonight</i>

899
00:55:35,388 --> 00:55:37,223
<i>The night they invented champagne</i>

900
00:55:38,725 --> 00:55:41,686
<i>It's plain as it can be
They thought of you and me</i>

901
00:55:42,228 --> 00:55:44,272
<i>The night they invented champagne</i>

902
00:55:45,773 --> 00:55:48,610
<i>They absolutely knew that
All we'd want to do</i>

903
00:55:48,943 --> 00:55:51,154
<i>Is fly to the sky on champagne</i>

904
00:55:52,071 --> 00:55:54,532
<i>And shout to everyone in sight</i>

905
00:55:55,742 --> 00:55:57,535
<i>That since the world began</i>

906
00:55:57,785 --> 00:55:59,162
<i>No woman or a man</i>

907
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:02,749
<i>Has ever been as happy
As we are tonight</i>

908
00:56:22,101 --> 00:56:23,728
Why, there's Gaston.

909
00:56:24,103 --> 00:56:26,564
I didn't know he would
be at Trouville.

910
00:56:27,023 --> 00:56:29,108
Who's that child he's with?

911
00:56:32,862 --> 00:56:36,407
Me, I'm here on
very important business.

912
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,277
There she is.

913
00:58:01,576 --> 00:58:02,911
Riding is important.

914
00:58:03,828 --> 00:58:04,746
Go.

915
00:58:35,193 --> 00:58:36,361
<i>Chérie...</i>

916
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:41,366
...I must tell you that you upset
all my plans for the weekend.

917
00:58:41,616 --> 00:58:43,534
- May I?
- Please.

918
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:46,871
How did I do that?

919
00:58:47,455 --> 00:58:49,499
I came prepared for battle...

920
00:58:49,749 --> 00:58:52,877
...and an old wound
prevented me from charging.

921
00:58:53,127 --> 00:58:56,339
I don't think she
was your type anyhow, Honoré.

922
00:58:56,589 --> 00:58:58,466
- You were watching me?
- Force of habit.

923
00:58:58,716 --> 00:59:02,262
When a pretty woman came by,
I always had to watch you.

924
00:59:02,637 --> 00:59:04,597
What good fortune
brings you to Trouville?

925
00:59:04,847 --> 00:59:06,307
I came with Gaston and Gigi.

926
00:59:06,516 --> 00:59:07,475
You did?

927
00:59:07,684 --> 00:59:09,102
Gigi is my granddaughter.

928
00:59:09,477 --> 00:59:11,187
No, not your granddaughter.

929
00:59:11,437 --> 00:59:15,733
Oh, yes. Time does not
stand still for all of us, Honoré.

930
00:59:21,364 --> 00:59:22,824
Don't be nervous!

931
00:59:27,203 --> 00:59:29,122
Gaston is such a dear man.

932
00:59:29,372 --> 00:59:32,959
So sweet of him to bring
little Gigi and show her Trouville.

933
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:35,962
She's having a glorious time.

934
00:59:36,671 --> 00:59:38,172
And so is Gaston.

935
00:59:38,715 --> 00:59:41,259
I haven't seen him
this chipper in years.

936
00:59:46,264 --> 00:59:47,765
We had good times too...

937
00:59:48,141 --> 00:59:49,183
...didn't we?

938
00:59:49,434 --> 00:59:52,604
Come to think of it,
those last days we spent together...

939
00:59:52,854 --> 00:59:55,356
...were by the sea, weren't they?

940
00:59:55,732 --> 00:59:56,649
Were they?

941
00:59:57,317 --> 00:59:58,860
Of course they were.

942
00:59:59,068 --> 01:00:02,572
On the Riviera.
The pink villa.

943
01:00:02,822 --> 01:00:06,034
- I only remember the blue villa.
- Which was that?

944
01:00:06,242 --> 01:00:08,453
The one belonging to the soprano.

945
01:00:11,247 --> 01:00:12,123
You knew.

946
01:00:12,332 --> 01:00:13,416
But of course.

947
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:16,586
But I thought you left me
because of that Austrian count.

948
01:00:16,836 --> 01:00:18,004
But of course.

949
01:00:18,338 --> 01:00:19,547
But you didn't.

950
01:00:22,175 --> 01:00:24,802
I'll tell you about
that blue villa, Mamita.

951
01:00:25,178 --> 01:00:28,973
I was so much in love,
I wanted to marry you.

952
01:00:29,223 --> 01:00:30,433
Yes, it's true.

953
01:00:30,767 --> 01:00:33,478
I was beginning to think of marriage.

954
01:00:33,728 --> 01:00:36,105
Imagine!
Marriage, me.

955
01:00:36,981 --> 01:00:39,108
No. I was really desperate.

956
01:00:39,442 --> 01:00:42,278
I had to do something.
And what I did was the soprano.

957
01:00:42,904 --> 01:00:43,988
Thank you, Honoré.

958
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:47,784
That is the most charming and endearing
excuse for infidelity...

959
01:00:47,992 --> 01:00:49,577
...that I've ever heard.

960
01:00:50,328 --> 01:00:52,580
But I've never forgotten you.

961
01:00:52,997 --> 01:00:55,500
Not the last evening we spent together.

962
01:00:56,501 --> 01:01:00,421
I can remember everything
as if it were yesterday.

963
01:01:01,381 --> 01:01:02,674
<i>We met at 9</i>

964
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:04,092
<i>We met at 8</i>

965
01:01:04,425 --> 01:01:05,551
<i>I was on time</i>

966
01:01:05,843 --> 01:01:07,011
<i>No, you were late</i>

967
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:08,554
<i>Ah, yes</i>

968
01:01:08,846 --> 01:01:10,974
<i>I remember it well</i>

969
01:01:12,141 --> 01:01:13,434
<i>We dined with friends</i>

970
01:01:13,768 --> 01:01:14,852
<i>We dined alone</i>

971
01:01:15,103 --> 01:01:16,104
<i>A tenor sang</i>

972
01:01:16,437 --> 01:01:17,480
<i>A baritone</i>

973
01:01:18,356 --> 01:01:19,190
<i>Ah, yes</i>

974
01:01:19,524 --> 01:01:21,734
<i>I remember it well</i>

975
01:01:23,319 --> 01:01:25,321
<i>That dazzling April moon</i>

976
01:01:26,573 --> 01:01:28,366
<i>There was none that night</i>

977
01:01:29,742 --> 01:01:31,578
<i>And the month was June</i>

978
01:01:33,037 --> 01:01:34,163
<i>That's right</i>

979
01:01:34,497 --> 01:01:35,707
<i>That's right</i>

980
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:39,210
<i>It warms my heart
To know that you</i>

981
01:01:39,877 --> 01:01:42,797
<i>Remember still
The way you do</i>

982
01:01:44,048 --> 01:01:45,174
<i>Ah, yes</i>

983
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:49,429
<i>I remember it well</i>

984
01:01:55,977 --> 01:01:59,147
<i>- How often I've thought of that Friday...
- Monday</i>

985
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,567
<i>- night, when we had
Our last rendezvous</i>

986
01:02:03,568 --> 01:02:07,113
<i>And somehow I foolishly
Wondered if you might</i>

987
01:02:07,614 --> 01:02:10,700
<i>By some chance
Be thinking of it too</i>

988
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,246
<i>That carriage ride</i>

989
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:16,915
<i>You walked me home</i>

990
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:18,291
<i>You lost a glove</i>

991
01:02:18,583 --> 01:02:19,959
<i>I lost a comb</i>

992
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:21,544
<i>Ah, yes</i>

993
01:02:21,794 --> 01:02:23,713
<i>I remember it well</i>

994
01:02:25,131 --> 01:02:26,466
<i>That brilliant sky</i>

995
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:27,800
<i>We had some rain</i>

996
01:02:28,009 --> 01:02:29,135
<i>Those Russian songs</i>

997
01:02:29,427 --> 01:02:30,845
<i>From sunny Spain?</i>

998
01:02:31,346 --> 01:02:32,221
<i>Ah, yes</i>

999
01:02:32,555 --> 01:02:34,390
<i>I remember it well</i>

1000
01:02:35,934 --> 01:02:37,810
<i>You wore a gown of gold</i>

1001
01:02:39,145 --> 01:02:40,730
<i>I was all in blue</i>

1002
01:02:42,607 --> 01:02:44,067
<i>Am I getting old?</i>

1003
01:02:45,401 --> 01:02:46,444
<i>Oh, no</i>

1004
01:02:47,111 --> 01:02:48,154
<i>Not you</i>

1005
01:02:48,821 --> 01:02:50,281
<i>How strong you were</i>

1006
01:02:51,449 --> 01:02:52,575
<i>How young and gay</i>

1007
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:54,452
<i>A prince of love</i>

1008
01:02:55,036 --> 01:02:56,412
<i>In every way</i>

1009
01:02:57,538 --> 01:02:58,706
<i>Ah, yes</i>

1010
01:03:01,084 --> 01:03:04,128
<i>I remember it well</i>

1011
01:03:21,187 --> 01:03:22,689
- Where is she?
- In the salon, madame.

1012
01:03:22,939 --> 01:03:24,148
What's happened?

1013
01:03:24,357 --> 01:03:26,526
What's so important you couldn't
tell me on the telephone?

1014
01:03:26,776 --> 01:03:30,530
We have serious matters to discuss.
Collect yourself.

1015
01:03:30,947 --> 01:03:33,700
I doubt if I'll ever be able to.

1016
01:03:34,993 --> 01:03:37,078
Serious matters about what?

1017
01:03:37,328 --> 01:03:38,705
About Gigi.

1018
01:03:40,582 --> 01:03:44,168
You were at Trouville over the weekend
with Gaston Lachaille.

1019
01:03:45,003 --> 01:03:46,379
It was a dreadful mistake.

1020
01:03:46,629 --> 01:03:49,340
Dreadful mistake?
What are you talking about, Alicia?

1021
01:03:49,549 --> 01:03:51,259
My dear sister...

1022
01:03:51,509 --> 01:03:55,305
...has it ever occurred
to you that Gigi...?

1023
01:03:56,347 --> 01:03:57,390
Well?

1024
01:04:02,687 --> 01:04:03,855
Gigi?

1025
01:04:04,022 --> 01:04:06,316
Yes, Gigi.

1026
01:04:09,319 --> 01:04:10,820
It isn't possible.

1027
01:04:11,029 --> 01:04:13,489
Not if it's ruined at the
beginning through lack of tact.

1028
01:04:13,698 --> 01:04:17,827
And when did I display any lack of tact?
It was a most congenial weekend.

1029
01:04:18,077 --> 01:04:21,915
So congenial that Gaston returned,
canceled all engagements...

1030
01:04:22,165 --> 01:04:24,709
...and left Paris that same evening
for Monte Carlo.

1031
01:04:24,918 --> 01:04:26,794
He did?
For how long?

1032
01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:29,255
For what they describe as
an extended stay.

1033
01:04:29,505 --> 01:04:30,548
But why?

1034
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:32,425
It doesn't matter why.

1035
01:04:32,675 --> 01:04:35,845
It may be a blessing in disguise.
It gives us time.

1036
01:04:36,054 --> 01:04:36,971
Time for what?

1037
01:04:37,221 --> 01:04:39,641
For Gigi's lessons, of course.

1038
01:04:39,891 --> 01:04:42,310
See to it that she's here every day.

1039
01:04:50,276 --> 01:04:52,445
Do you really think...?

1040
01:04:52,946 --> 01:04:56,074
It's a chance.
But a chance that we must take.

1041
01:04:56,324 --> 01:04:58,034
From now on, dear sister...

1042
01:04:58,284 --> 01:05:01,037
...it's work, work, work...

1043
01:05:01,287 --> 01:05:04,457
...lessons, lessons, lessons.

1044
01:05:11,881 --> 01:05:15,551
Pick up the coffeepot with one hand
and the cup and saucer with the other.

1045
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,638
Always both.
Never the coffeepot alone.

1046
01:05:18,888 --> 01:05:20,056
Like this, Aunt?

1047
01:05:20,265 --> 01:05:22,600
Your grip on the saucer
must be firm...

1048
01:05:22,809 --> 01:05:24,686
...but not obviously so.

1049
01:05:25,019 --> 01:05:27,522
The saucer must seem so much
a part of your fingers...

1050
01:05:27,772 --> 01:05:30,900
...that one would think
it could only be removed by surgery.

1051
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:32,485
Now pour...

1052
01:05:32,735 --> 01:05:37,198
...and be sure the coffeepot is upright
before you take the cup away.

1053
01:05:37,824 --> 01:05:39,701
There must be no drops.

1054
01:05:42,745 --> 01:05:44,455
Now give it to me.

1055
01:05:47,166 --> 01:05:51,337
I don't take any, but be sure and
always ask about cream and sugar.

1056
01:05:51,546 --> 01:05:53,381
Now serve yourself.

1057
01:05:53,631 --> 01:05:55,508
And remember the firm grip.

1058
01:05:55,717 --> 01:05:58,261
No, the coffeepot first!

1059
01:06:06,227 --> 01:06:08,563
Now, you will try it once more.

1060
01:06:08,813 --> 01:06:11,566
Remember, you will go
to the door properly...

1061
01:06:11,858 --> 01:06:14,777
...turn, walk in properly
and sit down properly.

1062
01:06:14,986 --> 01:06:16,195
Now, go on.

1063
01:06:17,989 --> 01:06:22,201
And not like a marionette.
Keep your shoulders level.

1064
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:23,578
Now turn...

1065
01:06:24,078 --> 01:06:26,497
...walk back and sit down.

1066
01:06:29,626 --> 01:06:31,794
And don't flop into the chair.

1067
01:06:32,045 --> 01:06:34,172
Insinuate yourself.

1068
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:36,591
That's better.

1069
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:39,469
Now rise and exit the same way.

1070
01:06:39,802 --> 01:06:41,262
Don't jump up!

1071
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:43,181
Ascend!

1072
01:06:56,361 --> 01:06:59,364
Now, you hold the glass like this.

1073
01:07:00,698 --> 01:07:02,951
Charles, some more wine
for mademoiselle.

1074
01:07:09,624 --> 01:07:10,750
Watch me.

1075
01:07:13,795 --> 01:07:14,837
Try it.

1076
01:07:16,422 --> 01:07:17,715
Don't gulp it!

1077
01:07:17,966 --> 01:07:21,427
Sip it. A little at a time.

1078
01:07:23,096 --> 01:07:25,181
Fill mademoiselle's glass, Charles.

1079
01:07:29,018 --> 01:07:30,478
That's better.

1080
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:34,023
You have to fully enjoy the aroma.

1081
01:07:34,357 --> 01:07:37,860
Hold your first sip on the roof
of your mouth for a moment...

1082
01:07:38,069 --> 01:07:42,365
...and breathe through your nose.
Then you will feel the flavor.

1083
01:07:49,455 --> 01:07:51,708
Did you feel the perfume?

1084
01:07:55,169 --> 01:07:57,005
- No.
- Try it again.

1085
01:07:57,255 --> 01:07:59,007
A bad year will be sharp.

1086
01:07:59,257 --> 01:08:02,927
A good year, which this is,
of course, will waft.

1087
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:09,392
Marvelous!

1088
01:08:09,601 --> 01:08:12,061
That will be all, Charles.

1089
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:03,965
Hello, Grandma...

1090
01:10:13,016 --> 01:10:14,058
Hello, Gigi.

1091
01:10:14,475 --> 01:10:15,518
Come in.

1092
01:10:19,814 --> 01:10:21,566
How good to see you.

1093
01:10:22,358 --> 01:10:24,152
I have a present for...

1094
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:27,572
What's the matter with her?

1095
01:10:27,739 --> 01:10:29,032
Everything.

1096
01:10:30,325 --> 01:10:32,201
Don't you look well!

1097
01:10:33,036 --> 01:10:34,913
Did you have a nice trip?

1098
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,458
How was Monte Carlo this year?

1099
01:10:38,791 --> 01:10:41,920
Well, the sea is blue.
The palm trees are green.

1100
01:10:42,253 --> 01:10:45,131
The sun is yellow.
It all makes a lovely post card.

1101
01:10:45,381 --> 01:10:47,258
Just as it should be.

1102
01:10:47,634 --> 01:10:48,885
Actually, it's a bore.

1103
01:10:49,093 --> 01:10:53,473
One has to be as rich as you
to be bored at Monte Carlo.

1104
01:10:54,390 --> 01:10:56,726
I brought Gigi some caramels.

1105
01:10:56,976 --> 01:10:59,646
Really, Gaston,
you spoil her too much.

1106
01:11:00,521 --> 01:11:02,398
Would you like a cup of chamomile tea?

1107
01:11:02,607 --> 01:11:04,275
Please. Please, Mamita.

1108
01:11:15,703 --> 01:11:16,871
Look, Gaston.

1109
01:11:17,121 --> 01:11:19,415
Four yards of material in the skirt.

1110
01:11:24,295 --> 01:11:26,881
Well, don't I look great ladyish?

1111
01:11:27,215 --> 01:11:29,676
You look like
an organ-grinder's monkey!

1112
01:11:31,928 --> 01:11:33,846
An organ-grinder's monkey?

1113
01:11:34,097 --> 01:11:35,765
What happened to your
little Scotch dress?

1114
01:11:36,015 --> 01:11:38,434
And that ridiculous collar!

1115
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,728
And what's wrong with that collar?

1116
01:11:40,979 --> 01:11:43,856
It makes you look like
a giraffe with a goiter.

1117
01:11:47,193 --> 01:11:49,946
With all the talk
there is about you, Gaston...

1118
01:11:50,196 --> 01:11:52,907
...l've never heard it said
you had any taste in clothes.

1119
01:11:53,116 --> 01:11:55,994
Have you gone mad? How dare you
speak to Gaston like that?

1120
01:11:56,244 --> 01:11:58,246
Apologize.
Apologize at once!

1121
01:11:58,454 --> 01:12:01,040
I certainly will not.
This is a beautiful dress.

1122
01:12:01,374 --> 01:12:02,208
Gaston, please.

1123
01:12:02,417 --> 01:12:04,627
I beg of you, wait.
She'll apologize.

1124
01:12:04,836 --> 01:12:07,880
Is this the education she gets
from you and your sister?

1125
01:12:08,214 --> 01:12:10,341
My congratulations to you both.

1126
01:12:13,052 --> 01:12:14,137
What have you done?

1127
01:12:14,345 --> 01:12:17,432
Why did he fly off the handle?
He knew I'd answer him back.

1128
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,142
You ungrateful little thing.

1129
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:22,312
How can you be rude to Gaston
when he's been so good to us?

1130
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,981
And just when
we were trying so hard...

1131
01:12:25,857 --> 01:12:27,859
...to make an elegant
young lady out of you.

1132
01:12:28,067 --> 01:12:30,695
To show you off
to your best advantage.

1133
01:12:30,945 --> 01:12:34,240
You must admit, one doesn't have to
turn oneself inside out...

1134
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:36,534
...for an old friend like Gaston.

1135
01:12:36,784 --> 01:12:38,161
It's silly.

1136
01:12:38,703 --> 01:12:40,371
It's absolutely silly.

1137
01:13:11,778 --> 01:13:16,282
I've decided your new dress
may not be as bad as all that.

1138
01:13:16,908 --> 01:13:20,078
I didn't see it properly,
and perhaps I was a bit cruel.

1139
01:13:20,286 --> 01:13:22,664
To prove it,
I'll take you for a drive...

1140
01:13:22,872 --> 01:13:25,291
...for tea at the Reservoirs
in Versailles.

1141
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,502
- Would you like that?
- I'd love it!

1142
01:13:28,586 --> 01:13:31,673
Gaston wants to take me
to tea at the Reservoirs.

1143
01:13:32,590 --> 01:13:35,760
You've come back, Gaston.
How tolerant you are.

1144
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:37,136
I hadn't really gone.

1145
01:13:37,387 --> 01:13:39,722
We're going to tea
at the Reservoirs.

1146
01:13:39,973 --> 01:13:41,099
No, you're not.

1147
01:13:41,474 --> 01:13:42,850
I'm sorry, Gaston.

1148
01:13:43,851 --> 01:13:44,852
What do you mean?

1149
01:13:45,061 --> 01:13:46,104
Grandmama, please.

1150
01:13:46,354 --> 01:13:48,398
Gigi, go to your room
for a moment.

1151
01:13:48,648 --> 01:13:51,359
I have to talk to Gaston
about something.

1152
01:13:51,609 --> 01:13:52,569
No, Grandmama.

1153
01:13:52,819 --> 01:13:54,988
Gigi, do as you're told.

1154
01:14:00,493 --> 01:14:02,537
Mamita, what does this mean?

1155
01:14:02,829 --> 01:14:05,039
Something has changed here lately.

1156
01:14:05,248 --> 01:14:06,541
I can feel it.

1157
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:09,127
Sit down, Gaston.

1158
01:14:19,137 --> 01:14:20,221
Please.

1159
01:14:26,019 --> 01:14:28,771
Gaston, you know my friendship for you.

1160
01:14:29,022 --> 01:14:31,399
My friendship and my gratitude.

1161
01:14:32,233 --> 01:14:34,235
But I must not forget my duty.

1162
01:14:34,444 --> 01:14:39,282
Gigi's mother has neither the time
nor the mind to take care of her.

1163
01:14:39,532 --> 01:14:42,869
And Gigi isn't just another girl.
She's special.

1164
01:14:43,494 --> 01:14:44,579
Of course.

1165
01:14:44,871 --> 01:14:47,540
For years, you've been giving her
candies and trinkets...

1166
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:49,000
...and she adores you.

1167
01:14:49,334 --> 01:14:53,838
Now you want to take her in your
automobile to the Reservoirs for tea.

1168
01:14:54,839 --> 01:14:57,300
If it were just you and I,
I would say:

1169
01:14:57,508 --> 01:15:00,970
"Take Gigi wherever you want."
I would trust her with you anywhere.

1170
01:15:01,220 --> 01:15:04,807
But there are others, Gaston.
You are known everywhere.

1171
01:15:05,058 --> 01:15:07,602
For a woman to
go out with you alone now...

1172
01:15:07,894 --> 01:15:10,313
...with the eyes of Paris on you...

1173
01:15:10,855 --> 01:15:12,815
Are you trying to make me believe...

1174
01:15:13,107 --> 01:15:16,069
...that if Gigi goes out with me,
she'll be compromised?

1175
01:15:16,277 --> 01:15:18,738
Let us say she would be labeled.

1176
01:15:19,239 --> 01:15:23,034
A young girl who goes out with you
is no longer an ordinary young girl.

1177
01:15:23,284 --> 01:15:25,328
Not even a respectable young girl.

1178
01:15:25,578 --> 01:15:27,580
Mamita, this is absurd.

1179
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:31,584
As far as you are concerned,
it would be just another news item.

1180
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:34,879
But in this case, I would not
have the heart to laugh...

1181
01:15:35,088 --> 01:15:36,839
...when I read it in the newspapers.

1182
01:15:37,131 --> 01:15:39,342
This is too ridiculous
to discuss any further.

1183
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:43,346
I don't want to contradict you,
and I don't want to argue about it.

1184
01:15:43,554 --> 01:15:46,641
If you feel you're protecting Gigi
from some cruel fate...

1185
01:15:46,849 --> 01:15:47,767
...that's your affair.

1186
01:15:47,976 --> 01:15:51,479
I understand responsibility to Gigi
better than you.

1187
01:15:51,896 --> 01:15:56,526
I'll do all I can to entrust her
only to a man who'll be able to say:

1188
01:15:56,818 --> 01:16:00,572
"I'll take care of her.
I'll answer for her future."

1189
01:16:06,744 --> 01:16:09,664
Now, can I get you
your chamomile tea, Gaston?

1190
01:16:09,998 --> 01:16:12,500
No, thank you.
I have an appointment...

1191
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:14,544
...and I'm late already.

1192
01:16:14,794 --> 01:16:17,922
But forgive me if I wonder, madame...

1193
01:16:18,089 --> 01:16:21,551
...whom you are keeping her for?
Some underpaid bank clerk...

1194
01:16:21,843 --> 01:16:25,179
...who'll marry her and give her
four children in three years?

1195
01:16:25,388 --> 01:16:26,556
You're upset.
Please...

1196
01:16:26,806 --> 01:16:30,893
To see her married in white in
a dingy little church to a plumber...

1197
01:16:31,185 --> 01:16:33,271
...who'll only give her
a worthless name...

1198
01:16:33,438 --> 01:16:35,690
...and the squalor of good intentions?

1199
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:37,901
Very well, madame.
Very well!

1200
01:16:38,151 --> 01:16:39,402
If that's your ambition...

1201
01:16:39,694 --> 01:16:42,989
...inflict your misery
in the name of respectability.

1202
01:16:43,239 --> 01:16:45,909
I pity you!
I pity you all!

1203
01:16:51,706 --> 01:16:52,790
Upset!

1204
01:16:53,291 --> 01:16:54,751
What utter rubbish!

1205
01:17:16,522 --> 01:17:17,523
Pierre...

1206
01:17:18,191 --> 01:17:19,943
...do I look upset?

1207
01:17:20,652 --> 01:17:21,903
Yes, monsieur, you do.

1208
01:17:23,696 --> 01:17:24,822
Upset!

1209
01:17:30,995 --> 01:17:32,288
Upset indeed!

1210
01:17:32,956 --> 01:17:34,165
<i>She's a babe</i>

1211
01:17:34,666 --> 01:17:35,959
<i>Just a babe</i>

1212
01:17:36,292 --> 01:17:37,669
<i>Still cavorting in her crib</i>

1213
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:39,545
<i>Eating breakfast with a bib</i>

1214
01:17:39,879 --> 01:17:42,257
<i>With her baby teeth
And all her baby curls</i>

1215
01:17:43,049 --> 01:17:44,092
<i>She's a tot</i>

1216
01:17:44,759 --> 01:17:45,802
<i>Just a tot</i>

1217
01:17:46,427 --> 01:17:49,681
<i>Good for bouncing on your knee
I am positive that she</i>

1218
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:52,183
<i>Doesn't even know
That boys aren't girls</i>

1219
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:54,143
<i>She's a snip</i>

1220
01:17:54,769 --> 01:17:55,853
<i>Just a snip</i>

1221
01:17:56,479 --> 01:17:59,774
<i>Making dreadful baby noise
Having fun with all her toys</i>

1222
01:18:00,149 --> 01:18:02,402
<i>Just a chickadee
Who needs a mother hen</i>

1223
01:18:03,403 --> 01:18:06,322
<i>She's a cub, a papoose
You could never turn her loose</i>

1224
01:18:06,531 --> 01:18:09,325
<i>She's too infantile
To take her from her pen</i>

1225
01:18:13,162 --> 01:18:16,416
<i>Of course, that weekend in Trouville</i>

1226
01:18:17,375 --> 01:18:19,252
<i>In spite of all her youthful zeal</i>

1227
01:18:20,169 --> 01:18:21,754
<i>She was exceedingly polite</i>

1228
01:18:22,797 --> 01:18:24,757
<i>And on the whole, a sheer delight</i>

1229
01:18:25,717 --> 01:18:27,385
<i>And if it wasn't joy galore</i>

1230
01:18:28,469 --> 01:18:30,346
<i>At least not once was she a bore</i>

1231
01:18:31,556 --> 01:18:32,724
<i>That I recall</i>

1232
01:18:33,891 --> 01:18:35,310
<i>No, not at all</i>

1233
01:18:36,769 --> 01:18:37,812
<i>She's a child</i>

1234
01:18:38,229 --> 01:18:39,272
<i>A silly child</i>

1235
01:18:39,898 --> 01:18:43,067
<i>Adolescent to her toes
And good heaven, how it shows</i>

1236
01:18:43,318 --> 01:18:46,195
<i>Sticky thumbs are all the fingers
She has got</i>

1237
01:18:46,446 --> 01:18:47,488
<i>She's a child</i>

1238
01:18:47,947 --> 01:18:49,073
<i>A clumsy child</i>

1239
01:18:49,616 --> 01:18:52,869
<i>She's as swollen as a grape
And she doesn't have a shape</i>

1240
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:55,455
<i>Where her figure ought to be
It is not!</i>

1241
01:18:56,205 --> 01:18:57,248
<i>Just a child</i>

1242
01:18:57,665 --> 01:18:58,917
<i>A growing child</i>

1243
01:18:59,459 --> 01:19:02,587
<i>But so backward for her years
If a boy her age appears</i>

1244
01:19:02,837 --> 01:19:05,089
<i>I am certain
He will never call again</i>

1245
01:19:05,965 --> 01:19:09,093
<i>She's a scamp and a brat
Doesn't know where she is at</i>

1246
01:19:09,302 --> 01:19:11,471
<i>Unequipped and undesirable to men</i>

1247
01:19:14,599 --> 01:19:18,561
<i>Of course, I must in truth confess</i>

1248
01:19:19,145 --> 01:19:21,522
<i>That in her brand-new little dress</i>

1249
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:24,359
<i>She looked surprisingly mature</i>

1250
01:19:25,235 --> 01:19:27,278
<i>And had a definite allure</i>

1251
01:19:28,279 --> 01:19:30,406
<i>It was a shock, in fact, to me</i>

1252
01:19:31,115 --> 01:19:33,326
<i>A most amazing shock to see</i>

1253
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,620
<i>The way it clung</i>

1254
01:19:36,621 --> 01:19:38,206
<i>On one so young</i>

1255
01:19:40,458 --> 01:19:41,542
<i>She's a girl</i>

1256
01:19:41,918 --> 01:19:43,002
<i>A little girl</i>

1257
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:46,673
<i>Getting older, it is true
Which is what they always do</i>

1258
01:19:46,923 --> 01:19:50,677
<i>Till that unexpected hour
When they blossom like a flower</i>

1259
01:19:52,470 --> 01:19:53,513
Oh, no.

1260
01:20:00,019 --> 01:20:01,646
Oh, no.

1261
01:20:02,981 --> 01:20:04,023
But...

1262
01:20:06,526 --> 01:20:08,653
<i>There's sweeter music</i>

1263
01:20:09,195 --> 01:20:10,655
<i>When she speaks</i>

1264
01:20:10,905 --> 01:20:12,365
<i>Isn't there?</i>

1265
01:20:14,075 --> 01:20:15,660
<i>A different bloom</i>

1266
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:17,495
<i>About her cheeks</i>

1267
01:20:18,329 --> 01:20:19,789
<i>Isn't there?</i>

1268
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,585
<i>Could I be wrong?</i>

1269
01:20:24,127 --> 01:20:25,628
<i>Could it be so?</i>

1270
01:20:26,337 --> 01:20:30,174
<i>Oh, where
Oh, where did Gigi go?</i>

1271
01:20:42,687 --> 01:20:43,730
<i>Gigi</i>

1272
01:20:44,355 --> 01:20:46,566
<i>Am I a fool without a mind?</i>

1273
01:20:47,191 --> 01:20:49,402
<i>Or have I merely been too blind</i>

1274
01:20:49,819 --> 01:20:51,321
<i>To realize?</i>

1275
01:20:52,363 --> 01:20:53,823
<i>Oh, Gigi</i>

1276
01:20:54,490 --> 01:20:58,494
<i>Why, you've been growing up
Before my eyes</i>

1277
01:21:03,082 --> 01:21:04,125
<i>Gigi!</i>

1278
01:21:04,918 --> 01:21:08,922
<i>You're not at all
That funny, awkward little girl</i>

1279
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:11,507
<i>I knew</i>

1280
01:21:12,759 --> 01:21:14,218
<i>Oh, no</i>

1281
01:21:14,552 --> 01:21:16,137
<i>Overnight</i>

1282
01:21:16,429 --> 01:21:18,973
<i>There's been
A breathless change</i>

1283
01:21:20,558 --> 01:21:21,935
<i>In you</i>

1284
01:21:23,227 --> 01:21:24,687
<i>Oh, Gigi</i>

1285
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:27,941
<i>While you were trembling
On the brink</i>

1286
01:21:28,691 --> 01:21:31,819
<i>Was I out yonder somewhere
Blinking at a star?</i>

1287
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:35,114
<i>Oh, Gigi</i>

1288
01:21:36,199 --> 01:21:38,493
<i>Have I been standing up too close</i>

1289
01:21:39,202 --> 01:21:40,870
<i>Or back too far?</i>

1290
01:21:44,290 --> 01:21:46,000
<i>When did your sparkle</i>

1291
01:21:46,417 --> 01:21:48,002
<i>Turn to fire?</i>

1292
01:21:48,711 --> 01:21:51,589
<i>And your warmth
Become desire?</i>

1293
01:21:52,632 --> 01:21:54,592
<i>Oh, what miracle</i>

1294
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:58,554
<i>Has made you the way you are?</i>

1295
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:05,645
<i>Gigi!</i>

1296
01:22:14,779 --> 01:22:15,905
<i>Gigi!</i>

1297
01:22:24,998 --> 01:22:26,291
<i>Gigi!</i>

1298
01:22:34,757 --> 01:22:35,883
<i>Oh, no</i>

1299
01:22:36,801 --> 01:22:39,679
<i>I was mad not to have seen</i>

1300
01:22:40,346 --> 01:22:42,473
<i>The change in you</i>

1301
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:47,186
<i>Oh, Gigi!</i>

1302
01:22:47,687 --> 01:22:49,981
<i>While you were trembling
On the brink</i>

1303
01:22:50,356 --> 01:22:53,484
<i>Was I out yonder somewhere
Blinking at a star?</i>

1304
01:22:55,778 --> 01:22:57,113
<i>Oh, Gigi</i>

1305
01:22:58,156 --> 01:23:00,283
<i>Have I been standing up too close</i>

1306
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,702
<i>Or back to far?</i>

1307
01:23:06,122 --> 01:23:07,624
<i>When did your sparkle</i>

1308
01:23:08,708 --> 01:23:10,209
<i>Turn to fire?</i>

1309
01:23:11,794 --> 01:23:13,129
<i>And your warmth</i>

1310
01:23:13,546 --> 01:23:15,506
<i>Become desire?</i>

1311
01:23:16,883 --> 01:23:19,302
<i>Oh, what miracle</i>

1312
01:23:19,719 --> 01:23:22,472
<i>Has made you the way</i>

1313
01:23:24,515 --> 01:23:26,476
<i>You are?</i>

1314
01:23:41,908 --> 01:23:43,493
Mamita, are you alone?

1315
01:23:45,078 --> 01:23:48,831
Good. I have an important
business matter to discuss with you.

1316
01:23:54,504 --> 01:23:56,923
Now, let us recapitulate.

1317
01:23:57,173 --> 01:24:00,009
To begin with, he said she would
be spoiled as no other...

1318
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:04,305
He said she would be spoiled
as no other woman has been before.

1319
01:24:04,555 --> 01:24:08,393
It's all right, but it's vague.
I like everything spelled out.

1320
01:24:08,559 --> 01:24:10,436
Did he say precisely
where she would live?

1321
01:24:10,645 --> 01:24:13,064
He said a suitable house
on the Avenue du Bois.

1322
01:24:13,314 --> 01:24:14,691
- You're sure?
- Of course.

1323
01:24:14,899 --> 01:24:16,693
Well, very good.
Servants?

1324
01:24:16,901 --> 01:24:18,820
Yes, he mentioned servants.

1325
01:24:19,070 --> 01:24:20,488
What about an automobile?

1326
01:24:20,738 --> 01:24:22,865
I think so. I'm not quite sure.

1327
01:24:23,116 --> 01:24:25,451
She must have an automobile
and a chauffeur.

1328
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:28,997
I'm sure he didn't mean
to be evasive or ungenerous.

1329
01:24:29,247 --> 01:24:31,916
He suggested that you and I
and our lawyer...

1330
01:24:32,166 --> 01:24:35,503
...meet at his lawyer tomorrow
and draw it up in detail.

1331
01:24:35,753 --> 01:24:39,299
You call him and tell him to
bring his lawyer to our lawyer.

1332
01:24:39,549 --> 01:24:41,718
We'll draw it up in detail.

1333
01:24:41,926 --> 01:24:44,053
You mustn't be suspicious, Alicia.

1334
01:24:44,262 --> 01:24:46,389
- Gigi doesn't know yet?
- How could she?

1335
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:50,226
He just left. But he wants to
have dinner with her this evening.

1336
01:24:50,435 --> 01:24:53,229
When you speak to Gigi,
be sure and stress...

1337
01:24:53,438 --> 01:24:56,441
...the difficulties of the situation,
not the delights.

1338
01:24:56,649 --> 01:24:58,318
The role she will have to play.

1339
01:24:58,568 --> 01:25:00,320
She's a naive, thoughtless girl.

1340
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:02,822
You must warn her not to
ask for the moon.

1341
01:25:03,072 --> 01:25:04,240
Not only will he not give it...

1342
01:25:04,490 --> 01:25:07,619
Don't worry about her.
You think she's like you.

1343
01:25:07,869 --> 01:25:11,372
Actually, you don't know her.
There's no meanness in her at all.

1344
01:25:11,623 --> 01:25:12,665
Thank you very much.

1345
01:25:12,916 --> 01:25:15,084
I mean, she has no material ambition.

1346
01:25:15,335 --> 01:25:18,338
I understand. He should
send a present before tonight.

1347
01:25:18,588 --> 01:25:20,340
Let me know what it is.

1348
01:25:20,924 --> 01:25:21,925
Yes, I will.

1349
01:25:58,753 --> 01:26:00,046
Won't you sit down?

1350
01:26:24,487 --> 01:26:25,738
You know why I'm here?

1351
01:26:26,739 --> 01:26:27,865
Yes, I know.

1352
01:26:28,741 --> 01:26:30,118
Do you want to...

1353
01:26:30,785 --> 01:26:32,036
...or don't you?

1354
01:26:33,246 --> 01:26:34,747
I don't want to.

1355
01:26:37,083 --> 01:26:39,502
I don't know what you want.
You told Grandmama...

1356
01:26:39,752 --> 01:26:43,089
I know what I told your grandmother.
We don't have to repeat it.

1357
01:26:43,298 --> 01:26:45,925
Just tell me simply what
you don't want...

1358
01:26:46,467 --> 01:26:48,511
...and tell me what you do want.

1359
01:26:49,596 --> 01:26:50,847
Do you mean that?

1360
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:52,432
Of course.

1361
01:26:59,063 --> 01:27:02,108
You told Grandmama that
you wanted to take care of me.

1362
01:27:02,358 --> 01:27:04,027
To take care of you beautifully.

1363
01:27:04,277 --> 01:27:06,529
Beautifully.
That is, if I like it.

1364
01:27:08,448 --> 01:27:10,783
They've pounded into my head
I'm backward for my age...

1365
01:27:10,992 --> 01:27:13,328
...but I know what all this means.

1366
01:27:13,786 --> 01:27:17,290
To take care of me beautifully
means I shall go away with you...

1367
01:27:17,707 --> 01:27:20,001
...and that I shall sleep in your bed.

1368
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:21,794
Please, Gigi.

1369
01:27:22,086 --> 01:27:24,255
I beg of you, you embarrass me.

1370
01:27:26,049 --> 01:27:28,968
You weren't embarrassed to
talk to Grandmama about it.

1371
01:27:29,177 --> 01:27:32,513
And Grandmama wasn't embarrassed
to talk to me about it.

1372
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:37,810
But I know more than she told me.
To take care of me...

1373
01:27:38,019 --> 01:27:41,022
...means that I shall have
my photograph in the papers.

1374
01:27:41,272 --> 01:27:44,484
That I shall go to the Riviera.
To the races at Deauville.

1375
01:27:44,817 --> 01:27:48,571
And when we fight, it will
be in all the columns the next day.

1376
01:27:48,821 --> 01:27:53,076
And when you'd give me up,
as you did with Inès des Cévennes.

1377
01:27:53,326 --> 01:27:56,621
Who's been filling your head
with all these old stories?

1378
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:58,748
How do you know about that?

1379
01:28:00,083 --> 01:28:01,709
Why shouldn't I know?

1380
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,586
You're world famous.

1381
01:28:04,170 --> 01:28:06,506
I know about the woman
who stole from you.

1382
01:28:06,714 --> 01:28:08,633
<i>The contessa
who wanted to shoot you.</i>

1383
01:28:08,925 --> 01:28:12,428
The American who wanted to marry you.
I know what everybody knows.

1384
01:28:12,637 --> 01:28:15,556
These aren't the things
we have to talk about together.

1385
01:28:15,807 --> 01:28:19,018
That's all in the past,
over and done with.

1386
01:28:19,936 --> 01:28:21,187
Yes, Gaston.

1387
01:28:22,564 --> 01:28:24,232
Until it begins again.

1388
01:28:29,112 --> 01:28:31,739
It's not your fault
you're world famous.

1389
01:28:32,073 --> 01:28:35,451
It's just that I haven't got
a world famous sort of nature.

1390
01:28:36,995 --> 01:28:41,332
When it's over, Gaston Lachaille
goes off with another lady.

1391
01:28:41,583 --> 01:28:44,502
And I have only to go into
another gentleman's bed.

1392
01:28:47,005 --> 01:28:48,631
That won't do for me.

1393
01:28:49,591 --> 01:28:51,676
I'm not changeable.
That won't do for me.

1394
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:56,598
Grandmama and Aunt Alicia are on
your side, but this concerns me too.

1395
01:28:56,848 --> 01:28:59,684
And I think I should have
something to say about it.

1396
01:29:00,101 --> 01:29:02,645
And what I say is, it won't work.
It won't work!

1397
01:29:12,488 --> 01:29:17,619
Are you trying to find a way
to tell me that I don't please you?

1398
01:29:17,827 --> 01:29:19,287
That you don't like me?

1399
01:29:19,495 --> 01:29:20,830
Oh, no, Gaston!

1400
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:23,583
Oh, no. I do like you.

1401
01:29:25,627 --> 01:29:28,087
I'm so happy when I'm with you.

1402
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:34,218
Gaston, couldn't we go on
just as we are?

1403
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:36,846
Maybe seeing each other
a little more often?

1404
01:29:37,055 --> 01:29:40,600
You're a friend of the family.
Nobody would think anything of it.

1405
01:29:40,892 --> 01:29:43,770
You could go on bringing me
licorice and caramels...

1406
01:29:44,020 --> 01:29:45,730
...and champagne on my birthday.

1407
01:29:45,939 --> 01:29:49,359
And on Sundays, we can have
an extra special game of cards.

1408
01:29:49,609 --> 01:29:51,736
Wouldn't that be
a lovely little life?

1409
01:29:52,028 --> 01:29:53,780
A wonderful little life.

1410
01:29:54,155 --> 01:29:56,407
Except that you forget one thing:

1411
01:29:57,325 --> 01:29:58,826
I'm in love with you.

1412
01:30:02,538 --> 01:30:03,957
You never told me.

1413
01:30:04,999 --> 01:30:06,918
I haven't known it very long.

1414
01:30:07,669 --> 01:30:10,421
I discovered it
when I was away from you.

1415
01:30:10,964 --> 01:30:12,382
In Monte Carlo.

1416
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:19,430
You are a wicked man.

1417
01:30:22,058 --> 01:30:23,560
You're in love with me...

1418
01:30:23,768 --> 01:30:27,730
...and you want to drag me into a life
that will make me suffer!

1419
01:30:28,147 --> 01:30:32,652
You think nothing of exposing me
to all sorts of terrible adventures...

1420
01:30:32,902 --> 01:30:34,946
...ending in quarrels, separations...

1421
01:30:35,196 --> 01:30:37,740
...pistol shots,
Sandomirs and poison!

1422
01:30:37,991 --> 01:30:39,284
Please listen to me!

1423
01:30:39,534 --> 01:30:42,495
I should never have
believed this of you. Never!

1424
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:46,082
What's the matter?

1425
01:30:46,457 --> 01:30:47,917
What's happened?

1426
01:30:48,501 --> 01:30:50,670
She doesn't seem to want to.

1427
01:30:50,878 --> 01:30:52,088
What do you mean?

1428
01:30:52,338 --> 01:30:54,173
I mean she doesn't want to!

1429
01:30:54,549 --> 01:30:56,551
Are you going out of your mind?

1430
01:30:56,801 --> 01:30:59,929
As God is my witness,
I explained it to her. Believe me.

1431
01:31:00,179 --> 01:31:02,098
You explained too much!

1432
01:31:02,348 --> 01:31:06,019
You've trained her to know
nothing but the sordid and the vulgar.

1433
01:31:06,227 --> 01:31:09,981
But what about kindness,
sweetness, benevolence?

1434
01:31:10,231 --> 01:31:13,318
What of the tender heart
bulging with generosity?

1435
01:31:13,526 --> 01:31:16,863
These things exist too, madame.
Or have you never heard of them?

1436
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:30,543
Uncle! I'll tell you...

1437
01:31:30,877 --> 01:31:34,756
...Europe is breeding a generation
of vandals and ingrates.

1438
01:31:36,132 --> 01:31:37,550
Children are coming
into the world...

1439
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:40,011
...with ice-covered souls
and hatchets in their hands!

1440
01:31:40,261 --> 01:31:44,182
And before they have finished, they'll
smash everything beautiful and decent.

1441
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:45,433
Have a piece of cheese.

1442
01:31:45,683 --> 01:31:46,601
No, thank you.

1443
01:31:46,893 --> 01:31:49,312
I envy you, Uncle.
I envy you, your age.

1444
01:31:49,646 --> 01:31:50,772
For you, it was different.

1445
01:31:51,022 --> 01:31:54,359
You've been clean and good,
and it's been appreciated.

1446
01:31:54,609 --> 01:31:57,695
But not anymore.
It's over. All over.

1447
01:31:57,946 --> 01:32:00,323
I'm sorry to hear it.
A little salad?

1448
01:32:00,573 --> 01:32:01,616
No, thank you.

1449
01:32:03,117 --> 01:32:05,036
Imagine this if you can:

1450
01:32:05,328 --> 01:32:08,706
Here is a girl, living in
a moldy apartment, decaying walls...

1451
01:32:08,957 --> 01:32:11,876
...worm-ridden furniture,
surrounded by filth.

1452
01:32:12,085 --> 01:32:13,253
You're ruining my lunch.

1453
01:32:13,503 --> 01:32:16,130
Nothing to look forward to
but abject poverty.

1454
01:32:16,339 --> 01:32:18,800
My heart was touched.
I wanted to help her.

1455
01:32:19,092 --> 01:32:21,135
I offered her everything:

1456
01:32:21,386 --> 01:32:24,681
House, car, servants, clothes...

1457
01:32:25,765 --> 01:32:27,016
...and me.

1458
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:28,309
And?

1459
01:32:28,518 --> 01:32:30,186
She turned me down.

1460
01:32:31,271 --> 01:32:33,189
- Turned you down?
- Turned me down.

1461
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:34,524
It's impossible.

1462
01:32:34,816 --> 01:32:37,026
It's not impossible.
It just happened.

1463
01:32:37,277 --> 01:32:41,197
Obviously, that disgusting apartment
she lives in has driven her mad.

1464
01:32:41,447 --> 01:32:43,157
Her grandmother was delighted.

1465
01:32:43,408 --> 01:32:45,159
- Grandmother?
- Yes, Mamita.

1466
01:32:45,410 --> 01:32:47,287
But Gigi...
No, no, no. Not Gigi.

1467
01:32:47,537 --> 01:32:49,706
She refused me.
She turned me down.

1468
01:32:49,956 --> 01:32:52,625
I was refused, rejected, rebuffed...

1469
01:32:53,751 --> 01:32:55,378
...and repudiated.

1470
01:32:56,546 --> 01:33:00,592
They're a very peculiar family
with peculiar ideas.

1471
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,927
I negotiated with them myself once.

1472
01:33:03,094 --> 01:33:07,223
With me, one casual bit
of grazing in another pasture...

1473
01:33:07,557 --> 01:33:10,602
...and the gate was slammed behind me.

1474
01:33:11,936 --> 01:33:13,730
What did you do?

1475
01:33:13,980 --> 01:33:15,648
- I left immediately.
- Bravo!

1476
01:33:15,899 --> 01:33:17,734
The absolutely right thing to do.

1477
01:33:17,942 --> 01:33:18,776
Of course.

1478
01:33:19,027 --> 01:33:22,030
And when she sends for you,
which you realize she will...

1479
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:23,573
Of course.
I know she will.

1480
01:33:23,823 --> 01:33:26,993
This is plainly a maneuver
for better terms.

1481
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:28,661
Don't you go back!

1482
01:33:28,912 --> 01:33:30,747
I wouldn't go back
for anything in the world.

1483
01:33:30,997 --> 01:33:34,626
After all, you behaved
like a perfect gentleman.

1484
01:33:34,876 --> 01:33:36,210
No question about it.

1485
01:33:36,419 --> 01:33:39,213
You made your offer in good faith...

1486
01:33:39,464 --> 01:33:42,008
...before any emotional advance.

1487
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:45,219
An act of the purest chivalry.

1488
01:33:45,470 --> 01:33:47,430
I don't know any other way.

1489
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:51,851
And if she doesn't appreciate
the nobility of your conduct...

1490
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:55,104
...if she uses the beauty
of your nature...

1491
01:33:55,313 --> 01:33:57,440
...as a weapon for bargaining...

1492
01:33:58,191 --> 01:34:03,321
...then she's obviously not worth
the chivalry or the nobility.

1493
01:34:03,655 --> 01:34:06,491
It's no one's fault.
You're too good for her.

1494
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:10,245
Do you know how long
it will take you to forget her?

1495
01:34:10,662 --> 01:34:13,414
By tomorrow noon at the latest.

1496
01:34:14,832 --> 01:34:18,586
Why not consult your little book
and meet me at Maxim's tonight?

1497
01:34:18,836 --> 01:34:20,171
Splendid idea.

1498
01:34:20,421 --> 01:34:22,048
I would suggest a redhead.

1499
01:34:22,590 --> 01:34:25,343
Try Michèle. I saw her last night.
She looked heavenly.

1500
01:34:25,593 --> 01:34:26,803
I'll call her at once.

1501
01:34:27,053 --> 01:34:29,347
You should. She doesn't
have many good years left.

1502
01:34:29,597 --> 01:34:31,224
- See you at 9?
- Nine sharp.

1503
01:34:31,474 --> 01:34:32,684
Goodbye, Honoré.

1504
01:34:46,072 --> 01:34:47,198
<i>Poor boy</i>

1505
01:34:47,532 --> 01:34:48,658
<i>Poor boy</i>

1506
01:34:49,284 --> 01:34:52,745
<i>Downhearted and depressed
And in a spin</i>

1507
01:34:54,872 --> 01:34:55,915
<i>Poor boy</i>

1508
01:34:56,708 --> 01:34:57,709
<i>Poor boy</i>

1509
01:34:58,293 --> 01:35:02,422
<i>Oh, youth can really
Do a fellow in</i>

1510
01:35:06,759 --> 01:35:10,138
<i>How lovely to sit here
In the shade</i>

1511
01:35:10,430 --> 01:35:13,516
<i>With none of the woes
Of man and maid</i>

1512
01:35:13,766 --> 01:35:17,020
<i>I'm glad I'm not young anymore</i>

1513
01:35:21,024 --> 01:35:23,776
<i>The rivals that don't exist at all</i>

1514
01:35:24,569 --> 01:35:27,405
<i>The feeling you're only 2 feet tall</i>

1515
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:30,658
<i>I'm glad that I'm not young anymore</i>

1516
01:35:33,912 --> 01:35:35,538
<i>No more confusion</i>

1517
01:35:37,540 --> 01:35:39,709
<i>No morning-after surprise</i>

1518
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:43,379
<i>No self-delusion</i>

1519
01:35:44,881 --> 01:35:47,800
<i>That when you're telling those lies</i>

1520
01:35:48,968 --> 01:35:50,595
<i>She isn't wise</i>

1521
01:35:52,096 --> 01:35:54,557
<i>And even if love
Comes through the door</i>

1522
01:35:55,350 --> 01:35:58,144
<i>The kind that goes on forevermore</i>

1523
01:35:58,853 --> 01:36:03,107
<i>Forevermore is shorter than before</i>

1524
01:36:05,735 --> 01:36:08,905
<i>Oh, I'm so glad</i>

1525
01:36:10,615 --> 01:36:13,493
<i>That I'm not young anymore</i>

1526
01:36:20,375 --> 01:36:23,086
<i>The tiny remark that tortures you</i>

1527
01:36:23,962 --> 01:36:27,090
<i>The fear that your friends
Won't like her too</i>

1528
01:36:27,340 --> 01:36:30,593
<i>I'm glad I'm not young anymore</i>

1529
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:37,350
<i>The longing to end a stale affair</i>

1530
01:36:38,184 --> 01:36:40,895
<i>Until you find out she doesn't care</i>

1531
01:36:41,437 --> 01:36:45,650
<i>I'm glad that I'm not young anymore</i>

1532
01:36:47,652 --> 01:36:49,779
<i>No more frustration</i>

1533
01:36:51,322 --> 01:36:53,700
<i>No star-crossed lover am I</i>

1534
01:36:55,159 --> 01:36:56,869
<i>No aggravation</i>

1535
01:36:58,955 --> 01:37:01,499
<i>Just one reluctant reply</i>

1536
01:37:03,418 --> 01:37:05,211
<i>Lady, goodbye</i>

1537
01:37:06,879 --> 01:37:10,133
<i>The fountain of youth
Is dull as paint</i>

1538
01:37:10,717 --> 01:37:13,511
<i>Methuselah is my patron saint</i>

1539
01:37:14,345 --> 01:37:18,057
<i>I've never been so comfortable before</i>

1540
01:37:21,227 --> 01:37:24,606
<i>Oh, I'm so glad</i>

1541
01:37:26,274 --> 01:37:29,903
<i>That I'm not young anymore</i>

1542
01:38:07,941 --> 01:38:08,900
Yes, madame?

1543
01:38:09,108 --> 01:38:11,527
Charles, I'm going out.

1544
01:38:12,195 --> 01:38:14,572
Order me a carriage immediately.

1545
01:38:20,328 --> 01:38:22,747
Yes, madame.
Right away, madame.

1546
01:38:43,643 --> 01:38:46,521
Would you repeat that again, please?

1547
01:38:47,146 --> 01:38:48,856
She doesn't want to.

1548
01:38:49,566 --> 01:38:51,067
She doesn't want to?

1549
01:38:51,317 --> 01:38:52,652
She doesn't want to.

1550
01:38:52,902 --> 01:38:55,238
Such stupidity is without equal...

1551
01:38:55,446 --> 01:38:58,658
...in the entire history
of human relations.

1552
01:39:06,207 --> 01:39:08,626
It must be your fault.
It must be.

1553
01:39:08,876 --> 01:39:12,589
You must've emphasized the difficulties
instead of the delights.

1554
01:39:12,797 --> 01:39:14,632
What did you say
to the little monster?

1555
01:39:14,882 --> 01:39:18,011
Gigi is perhaps a little slow
about certain things...

1556
01:39:18,303 --> 01:39:20,972
...but just because she's not
attracted to Gaston...

1557
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:22,682
...doesn't make her a monster.

1558
01:39:22,891 --> 01:39:24,601
It doesn't make her a princess.

1559
01:39:24,809 --> 01:39:26,019
What did you say to her?

1560
01:39:26,269 --> 01:39:30,565
Did you tell her about love,
travel, moonlight, Italy?

1561
01:39:30,940 --> 01:39:33,443
About hummingbirds
in all the flowers...

1562
01:39:33,651 --> 01:39:36,738
...and making love in a
gardenia-scented garden?

1563
01:39:36,988 --> 01:39:38,323
I couldn't tell her that.

1564
01:39:38,573 --> 01:39:41,242
I've never been further
than the Riviera.

1565
01:39:41,534 --> 01:39:43,119
Couldn't you have invented it?

1566
01:39:43,411 --> 01:39:44,829
No, Alicia, I could not.

1567
01:39:45,079 --> 01:39:46,372
It's incredible.

1568
01:39:46,664 --> 01:39:48,499
Incredible!
Where is she?

1569
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:51,836
Perhaps I should talk to her
and tell her what she's missing.

1570
01:39:52,086 --> 01:39:53,713
It's the glory of romance...

1571
01:39:54,047 --> 01:39:57,383
...forgetting everything in the arms
of the man who adores you...

1572
01:39:57,592 --> 01:40:01,846
...listening to the music of love
in an eternal spring.

1573
01:40:02,931 --> 01:40:06,517
- And when eternal spring is over?
- What difference does that make?

1574
01:40:06,726 --> 01:40:09,562
It makes a difference to Gigi.
And I'll tell you something:

1575
01:40:09,812 --> 01:40:12,273
I'm not sure I don't agree with her.

1576
01:40:13,024 --> 01:40:16,569
You're a fool! And your
granddaughter takes after you.

1577
01:40:16,819 --> 01:40:21,950
When I think of the time and effort
I've lavished on that idiotic child!

1578
01:40:38,591 --> 01:40:43,471
I received a note from Gigi.
She said she wanted to see me.

1579
01:40:43,721 --> 01:40:44,764
Of course.

1580
01:40:48,226 --> 01:40:49,435
Won't you come in?

1581
01:40:49,644 --> 01:40:50,770
Thank you.

1582
01:40:51,563 --> 01:40:52,647
You know my sister?

1583
01:40:52,855 --> 01:40:55,858
My dear Mr. Lachaille.
What a pleasant surprise.

1584
01:40:56,067 --> 01:40:57,944
And how is your enchanting father?

1585
01:40:58,194 --> 01:40:59,988
He has diabetes.

1586
01:41:00,238 --> 01:41:02,532
If one is in the sugar business...

1587
01:41:02,782 --> 01:41:05,493
And your attractive mother?
Well, I hope.

1588
01:41:16,796 --> 01:41:18,923
Gaston, I have been thinking.

1589
01:41:21,134 --> 01:41:24,012
I'd rather be miserable
with you than without you.

1590
01:42:57,522 --> 01:43:02,193
<i>Say a prayer
For me tonight</i>

1591
01:43:03,653 --> 01:43:06,155
<i>I'll need every prayer</i>

1592
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:10,201
<i>That you can spare
To get me by</i>

1593
01:43:12,912 --> 01:43:15,373
<i>Say a prayer</i>

1594
01:43:15,873 --> 01:43:17,917
<i>And while you're praying</i>

1595
01:43:18,835 --> 01:43:20,837
<i>Keep on saying</i>

1596
01:43:21,963 --> 01:43:24,090
<i>She's much too young to die</i>

1597
01:43:26,843 --> 01:43:29,345
<i>On to your Waterloo</i>

1598
01:43:29,929 --> 01:43:31,723
<i>Whispers my heart</i>

1599
01:43:33,057 --> 01:43:35,685
<i>Pray I'll be Wellington</i>

1600
01:43:36,269 --> 01:43:37,729
<i>Not Bonaparte</i>

1601
01:43:40,481 --> 01:43:42,525
<i>Say a prayer</i>

1602
01:43:43,151 --> 01:43:45,111
<i>For me this evening</i>

1603
01:43:46,487 --> 01:43:48,948
<i>Bow your head and please</i>

1604
01:43:50,199 --> 01:43:52,160
<i>Stay on your knees</i>

1605
01:43:54,329 --> 01:43:55,830
<i>Tonight</i>

1606
01:46:26,981 --> 01:46:30,485
I thought perhaps we might
go to Siena in July...

1607
01:46:30,735 --> 01:46:32,445
...beginning of the season.

1608
01:46:33,738 --> 01:46:35,907
And when do we go to Deauville?

1609
01:46:36,157 --> 01:46:37,784
At the end of August.

1610
01:46:38,034 --> 01:46:41,246
It isn't absolutely necessary,
if you'd rather not.

1611
01:46:41,496 --> 01:46:43,206
Don't say it. I'd love to go.

1612
01:46:43,456 --> 01:46:45,208
Especially to the casino.

1613
01:46:46,292 --> 01:46:48,544
You know how much I love to gamble.

1614
01:46:50,004 --> 01:46:51,547
Would you like more coffee?

1615
01:46:52,090 --> 01:46:53,341
I'll do it.

1616
01:46:55,510 --> 01:46:59,806
Of course, the roulette wheel won't
be as easy to beat as you are.

1617
01:47:02,308 --> 01:47:03,601
Nor as easy to cheat.

1618
01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:06,437
You always knew that I cheated,
didn't you?

1619
01:47:38,595 --> 01:47:39,846
Look.

1620
01:47:40,638 --> 01:47:41,347
What?

1621
01:47:41,556 --> 01:47:42,891
Madame Dunard.

1622
01:47:43,641 --> 01:47:45,727
How do you know Madame Dunard?

1623
01:47:46,019 --> 01:47:49,105
I know all about Madame Dunard.
Do you see her pearls?

1624
01:47:51,399 --> 01:47:52,525
Dipped.

1625
01:47:53,943 --> 01:47:56,112
Dipped. Not worth a sou.

1626
01:47:56,946 --> 01:47:58,448
The poor thing doesn't know it.

1627
01:47:58,656 --> 01:48:00,658
It's just a matter of time now.

1628
01:48:03,494 --> 01:48:05,079
Would you like to dance?

1629
01:48:05,496 --> 01:48:06,915
I'd love to.

1630
01:48:09,667 --> 01:48:10,919
What an evening.

1631
01:48:11,377 --> 01:48:12,962
Don't you think so, darling?

1632
01:48:15,340 --> 01:48:17,759
Gaston, my boy, I waited for you.

1633
01:48:17,967 --> 01:48:21,054
- Good evening, Honoré.
- Good evening, Monsieur Lachaille.

1634
01:48:21,346 --> 01:48:22,931
Do you know what
we are going to do?

1635
01:48:23,181 --> 01:48:24,474
We are going to...

1636
01:48:37,111 --> 01:48:39,155
What's that in your breast pocket?

1637
01:48:40,281 --> 01:48:42,033
- I'm sorry.
- What is it?

1638
01:48:45,453 --> 01:48:47,121
It's a present for you.

1639
01:48:51,334 --> 01:48:52,961
Wouldn't you like to see it?

1640
01:48:53,211 --> 01:48:54,754
Oh, no. Not now.

1641
01:48:55,672 --> 01:48:58,007
Later. I'd rather dance with you.

1642
01:49:09,978 --> 01:49:11,312
May I see it now?

1643
01:49:11,854 --> 01:49:13,231
The present.

1644
01:49:20,822 --> 01:49:22,991
Gaston, that's beautiful.

1645
01:49:23,741 --> 01:49:25,702
They're simply beautiful.

1646
01:49:26,661 --> 01:49:28,413
Oh, what a color!

1647
01:49:29,914 --> 01:49:33,251
Only the most beautiful emeralds
contain that miracle...

1648
01:49:33,459 --> 01:49:35,461
...of elusive blue.

1649
01:49:37,714 --> 01:49:39,257
What taste you have.

1650
01:49:40,425 --> 01:49:43,887
If I may say so, much better
than your taste in clothes.

1651
01:49:45,972 --> 01:49:49,058
- May I put it on?
- The clasp is a bit tricky.

1652
01:49:49,267 --> 01:49:51,728
Why not ask the lady
in the powder room to help?

1653
01:49:51,978 --> 01:49:53,855
Yes, of course.
Thank you.

1654
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:06,117
My dear, dear, dear boy.

1655
01:50:06,784 --> 01:50:09,787
How did it happen?
She changed her mind?

1656
01:50:10,788 --> 01:50:11,831
Obviously.

1657
01:50:12,123 --> 01:50:13,541
How delicious!

1658
01:50:13,791 --> 01:50:16,669
Did you have to
improve the arrangement?

1659
01:50:17,128 --> 01:50:18,922
Please don't be vulgar.

1660
01:50:20,214 --> 01:50:21,883
She looks adorable.

1661
01:50:22,300 --> 01:50:24,761
So fresh, so eager...

1662
01:50:25,136 --> 01:50:26,387
...so young.

1663
01:50:26,721 --> 01:50:30,099
It's the sophisticated women
who get boring so quickly.

1664
01:50:30,433 --> 01:50:33,728
What can they give you?
Everything but surprise.

1665
01:50:33,978 --> 01:50:35,855
But with someone like Gigi...

1666
01:50:36,522 --> 01:50:38,775
She can amuse you for months.

1667
01:50:39,567 --> 01:50:42,528
I'm so happy for you.
I can't wait to tell Manuel.

1668
01:50:42,737 --> 01:50:44,364
Good night. Good night.

1669
01:50:52,163 --> 01:50:53,539
I don't understand.

1670
01:50:53,748 --> 01:50:54,999
What's wrong?

1671
01:50:55,500 --> 01:50:57,418
It's too early to go home yet.

1672
01:50:59,045 --> 01:51:01,798
I thought I was doing so well.
What's the matter?

1673
01:51:08,596 --> 01:51:09,973
I don't want to go home yet!

1674
01:51:10,306 --> 01:51:11,558
Please, Gaston.

1675
01:51:12,809 --> 01:51:15,812
Gaston, won't you tell me
what I've done wrong?

1676
01:51:17,397 --> 01:51:19,649
Gaston, do tell me. Please!

1677
01:51:27,365 --> 01:51:28,491
What's happened?

1678
01:51:29,701 --> 01:51:31,244
Gigi, what's happened?

1679
01:53:33,157 --> 01:53:34,534
May I come in?

1680
01:53:42,542 --> 01:53:43,835
Gaston, please.

1681
01:53:44,085 --> 01:53:46,170
No newspapers. No scandal.

1682
01:53:48,756 --> 01:53:51,801
Madame, will you do me the honor...

1683
01:53:52,135 --> 01:53:53,344
...the favor...

1684
01:53:53,595 --> 01:53:57,223
...give me the infinite joy
of bestowing on me...

1685
01:53:57,515 --> 01:53:59,559
...Gigi's hand in marriage?

1686
01:54:14,866 --> 01:54:16,034
Thank heaven.
