1
00:03:01,956 --> 00:03:03,924
<i>She looks at me every day.</i>

2
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:05,888
<i>Mary Jane Watson.</i>

3
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,087
<i>Oh, boy. If she only knew</i>
<i>how I felt about her.</i>

4
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:12,061
<i>But she can never know.</i>

5
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,669
<i>I made a choice once to live</i>
<i>a life of responsibility.</i>

6
00:03:15,836 --> 00:03:18,134
<i>A life she can never be a part of.</i>

7
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:19,602
<i>Who am I?</i>

8
00:03:19,774 --> 00:03:22,368
<i>I'm Spider-Man, given a job to do.</i>

9
00:03:22,543 --> 00:03:25,535
<i>And I'm Peter Parker,</i>
<i>and I, too, have a job.</i>

10
00:03:25,713 --> 00:03:27,271
Parker. Parker!

11
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:29,682
No, no, no, stop! Stop!

12
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:33,780
Parker, you're late, man. Always late.

13
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:36,889
I'm sorry, Mr. Aziz.
There was a disturbance.

14
00:03:37,057 --> 00:03:39,321
Another disturbance.
Always a disturbance with you.

15
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:42,291
Come on, 21 minutes ago,
in comes order.

16
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:46,763
Harmattan, Burton & Smith.
Eight extra-large deep-dish pizzas.

17
00:03:48,035 --> 00:03:50,026
I told you,
I don't understand that language.

18
00:03:50,204 --> 00:03:52,138
- Speak English.
- You can't make pizza.

19
00:03:52,306 --> 00:03:54,171
I can't?
I've been making pizza five years.

20
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:57,139
In eight minutes, I am defaulting on
Joe's 29-minute guarantee.

21
00:03:57,311 --> 00:04:00,246
Then, not only am I receiving
no money for these pizzas...

22
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:03,042
...but I will lose the customer forever
to Pizza Yurt.

23
00:04:03,217 --> 00:04:06,414
- Why didn't you send Saleem?
- Saleem was deported yesterday.

24
00:04:06,587 --> 00:04:08,578
- Look... Smiley.
- What about my cheese pizza?

25
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:11,748
Look, you are my only hope, all right?
You have to make it in time.

26
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:16,057
Peter, you're a nice guy.
But you're just not dependable.

27
00:04:16,463 --> 00:04:18,294
This is your last chance.

28
00:04:18,465 --> 00:04:23,198
You have to go 42 blocks
in 7 1/2 minutes or your ass is fired.

29
00:04:24,872 --> 00:04:26,772
Go!

30
00:04:48,929 --> 00:04:50,419
Hey, what, are you stupid?

31
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:15,616
Whoa! He stole that guy's pizzas!

32
00:05:24,331 --> 00:05:25,923
I'm gonna get it!

33
00:05:41,548 --> 00:05:43,880
Hey, you guys.
No playing in the streets.

34
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:45,313
Yes, Mr. Spider-Man.

35
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:47,280
See you.

36
00:05:48,422 --> 00:05:49,616
Way to go, Spidey!

37
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:00,759
Pizza time.

38
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:07,091
You're late.

39
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:09,366
I'm not paying for those.

40
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:30,113
Elevator.

41
00:07:46,907 --> 00:07:50,434
Joe's 29-minute guarantee
is a promise, man.

42
00:07:50,611 --> 00:07:55,105
I know to you, Parker, a promise
means nothing. But to me, it's serious.

43
00:07:55,282 --> 00:07:57,250
It's serious to me too, Mr. Aziz.

44
00:07:57,418 --> 00:07:59,909
- You're fired. Go.
- Please, I need this job.

45
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:02,612
- You're fired.
- Look, give me another chance.

46
00:08:11,799 --> 00:08:13,130
<i>You're fired.</i>

47
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,491
- Parker, hello. You're fired.
- Why?

48
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:17,159
Dogs catching Frisbees?

49
00:08:17,337 --> 00:08:19,635
Pigeons in the park?
A couple geezers playing chess?

50
00:08:19,807 --> 00:08:21,035
- Boss.
- Not now.

51
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,938
The <i>Bugle</i> could show another side
of New York for a change.

52
00:08:24,111 --> 00:08:27,046
We got six minutes to deadline, Jonah.
We need page one.

53
00:08:27,214 --> 00:08:30,615
I don't pay you to be a sensitive artiste.
I pay you... Still not now!

54
00:08:30,784 --> 00:08:33,378
I pay you because that psycho
Spider-Man will pose for you.

55
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,283
He won't let me take
any more pictures.

56
00:08:35,456 --> 00:08:37,048
You turned the whole city
against him.

57
00:08:37,224 --> 00:08:38,714
A fact I'm very proud of.

58
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:42,658
Get your pretty little portfolio off my
desk before I go into a diabetic coma.

59
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:46,197
- It's your wife, she lost her checkbook.
- Thanks for the good news.

60
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:49,699
Please, isn't there any of these shots
you can use? I need the money.

61
00:08:51,071 --> 00:08:52,902
Miss Brant. Get me a violin.

62
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:54,768
Five minutes to deadline, Jonah.

63
00:08:54,942 --> 00:08:57,638
Run a picture of a rancid chicken.
Here's the headline:

64
00:08:57,811 --> 00:08:59,711
"Food Poisoning Scare Sweeps City."

65
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,178
- Some food got poisoned?
- I'm a little nauseous.

66
00:09:02,349 --> 00:09:04,214
All right, Mr. Jameson.

67
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,080
It stinks.
Robbie, there's your page one.

68
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:09,882
"Masked Menace Terrorizes Town."

69
00:09:10,057 --> 00:09:11,615
I told you, he's not a menace.

70
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,384
- I told you...
- I'll take care of it.

71
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,187
- I'll give you 150.
- Three hundred.

72
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,858
That's outrageous.

73
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,998
Done. Give this to the girl.

74
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,360
Thank you. Bye-bye.

75
00:09:20,834 --> 00:09:22,324
Hi.

76
00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:24,002
Hey, Pete.

77
00:09:26,974 --> 00:09:30,808
I don't think this covers the advance
I gave you a couple weeks ago.

78
00:09:31,145 --> 00:09:33,113
- Right.
- Sorry.

79
00:09:34,314 --> 00:09:35,542
Hey.

80
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:37,607
Chin up, okay?

81
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:52,197
Watch it, jerk!

82
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,844
Dr. Connors. Sorry.

83
00:10:05,012 --> 00:10:06,536
Where were you headed, Parker?

84
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,008
To your class.

85
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:10,013
My class is over.

86
00:10:10,184 --> 00:10:12,379
See me standing here?

87
00:10:12,553 --> 00:10:16,353
I'm sorry. I'm trying.
I wanna be here.

88
00:10:16,523 --> 00:10:17,854
Then be here.

89
00:10:19,226 --> 00:10:20,693
Look at you, Peter.

90
00:10:21,228 --> 00:10:25,562
Your grades have been steadily
declining. You're late for class.

91
00:10:25,732 --> 00:10:28,633
You always appear exhausted.

92
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,129
Your paper on fusion is still overdue.

93
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:35,469
I know. I'm planning to write it
on Dr. Otto Octavius.

94
00:10:35,642 --> 00:10:38,770
Planning is not a major
at this university.

95
00:10:42,115 --> 00:10:44,106
Octavius is a friend of mine.

96
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:46,442
Better do your research, Parker.

97
00:10:46,787 --> 00:10:49,950
Get it done, or I'm failing you.

98
00:11:11,345 --> 00:11:13,472
Surprise!

99
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:15,581
Well, say something.

100
00:11:15,749 --> 00:11:17,011
What's the occasion?

101
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:19,744
Really, Peter. It's your birthday!

102
00:11:20,287 --> 00:11:23,085
Whether you want
to remember it or not.

103
00:11:23,457 --> 00:11:26,756
He lives in another reality.
Don't you, Pete?

104
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:28,861
- Hi, M.J.
- Hi.

105
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:30,728
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

106
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:32,125
Long time, no see.

107
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:36,161
So how's the play?
I read a great review.

108
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:38,031
It's going fine. It's going good.

109
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:39,467
She's brilliant in it.

110
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,301
Harry sent me roses.

111
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:44,035
So where you been, pal?
You don't return my calls.

112
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:47,377
I've been busy.

113
00:11:47,547 --> 00:11:51,108
Taking pictures of Spider-Man?
How's the bug these days?

114
00:11:51,285 --> 00:11:53,253
The less you see of that man,
the better.

115
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,878
Now, let's all go into the other room
and have something to eat.

116
00:11:57,057 --> 00:11:58,319
I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.

117
00:11:58,492 --> 00:12:00,619
So how are things going at Oscorp?

118
00:12:00,794 --> 00:12:03,661
They're great.
I'm head of Special Projects.

119
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,060
We're about to make
a breakthrough on fusion.

120
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:10,329
How lovely, Harry. Your father
would be so proud, rest his soul.

121
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:11,801
Thank you.

122
00:12:12,205 --> 00:12:15,971
We're actually funding
one of your idols, Pete. Otto Octavius.

123
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:18,577
- I'm writing a paper on him.
- You want to meet him?

124
00:12:18,745 --> 00:12:20,007
You'd introduce me?

125
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,377
You bet. Octavius is
gonna put Oscorp on the map...

126
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,575
...in a way my father
never even dreamed of.

127
00:12:25,752 --> 00:12:27,686
M.J., could you give me a hand?

128
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:31,649
She's waiting for you, pal.

129
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:33,587
What do you mean?

130
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,228
The way she looks at you
or doesn't look at you.

131
00:12:36,763 --> 00:12:38,128
However you want to look at it.

132
00:12:38,498 --> 00:12:40,659
I don't have time for girls right now.

133
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:42,165
Why, are you dead?

134
00:12:42,336 --> 00:12:43,928
I've been kind of busy.

135
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:45,696
Taking pictures of your friend?

136
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:48,698
Could we get off that subject?

137
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:52,201
I want us to be friends, Harry.
I want us to trust each other.

138
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:54,040
Then be honest with me.

139
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:57,177
If you knew who he was,
would you tell me?

140
00:13:01,988 --> 00:13:04,354
Peter, don't you understand
how I feel?

141
00:13:04,524 --> 00:13:06,458
I want this guy dead.

142
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:09,424
The same way you want the guy
who killed your Uncle Ben dead.

143
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,406
I'm sorry. I don't mean to
rag on you on your birthday.

144
00:13:22,576 --> 00:13:24,601
You're my buddy, you know that.

145
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,910
You're family, Pete.

146
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:32,185
My father loved you.
You were like a son to him.

147
00:13:38,024 --> 00:13:39,992
Thank you, Harry.

148
00:14:13,794 --> 00:14:15,284
May.

149
00:14:15,462 --> 00:14:17,020
Oh, what, Ben?

150
00:14:18,365 --> 00:14:20,299
Wait.

151
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:21,933
- Aunt May.
- Oh, my.

152
00:14:22,369 --> 00:14:27,568
Oh, Peter. Oh, for a second there,
I thought I was years ago.

153
00:14:29,776 --> 00:14:31,710
Everybody's gone, aren't they?

154
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:33,806
Did they have a good time?

155
00:14:34,314 --> 00:14:35,576
I'm sure they did.

156
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:41,251
- You okay?
- Of course. But you go home.

157
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:47,020
And be careful. I don't like that
scooter thing you drive around.

158
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:48,988
I'm worried about you.

159
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:54,389
You're so alone.
And I saw the letter from the bank.

160
00:14:54,568 --> 00:14:57,002
Oh, my. You did?

161
00:14:57,504 --> 00:14:58,835
Oh, well.

162
00:14:59,005 --> 00:15:00,438
So?

163
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:02,668
I'm a little behind.

164
00:15:03,677 --> 00:15:05,372
Everybody is.

165
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,048
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

166
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:12,947
I'm tired,
and you better start back home.

167
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:17,246
Here, kiddo. Happy birthday.

168
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:19,216
You need it more than I do.

169
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:21,917
- No, I can't take that from you.
- Yes, you can!

170
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:24,120
You can take this money from me.

171
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:27,027
For God's sake, it's not much.
Now, take it!

172
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,691
And don't you dare leave it here.

173
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,804
Oh, I'm sorry.

174
00:15:33,006 --> 00:15:36,533
It's just that I miss
your uncle Ben so much.

175
00:15:38,678 --> 00:15:43,615
Can you believe that it's two years
next month since he was taken?

176
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:48,147
I think to myself at times...

177
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:53,622
...were I to face the one responsible
for what happened, I'd...

178
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:56,686
Oh, I don't know what I'd do.

179
00:16:03,236 --> 00:16:04,828
Now...

180
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,470
...you better take
the rest of your cake home.

181
00:16:24,224 --> 00:16:25,714
Hey.

182
00:16:25,892 --> 00:16:27,985
Hey. You're still here.

183
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:30,721
I saw your billboard on Bleecker.

184
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:34,264
Isn't it funny?
I'm really kind of embarrassed.

185
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:38,393
Don't be. It's nice.
I get to see you every day now.

186
00:16:38,572 --> 00:16:39,971
The photographer liked my face.

187
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,007
I was only supposed to be
in the catalogue.

188
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:46,668
Then I got the part in the play.
Everything at once.

189
00:16:46,846 --> 00:16:48,837
Your dream came true.

190
00:16:49,482 --> 00:16:51,177
How about yours?

191
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:56,278
I'm fine.

192
00:16:58,358 --> 00:17:00,724
I wish you'd come see the play.

193
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:03,089
You're the one who
always encouraged me.

194
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,830
I plan to.

195
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,202
I liked seeing you tonight, Peter.

196
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,205
Oh, boy, yeah.

197
00:17:17,844 --> 00:17:20,779
"Oh, boy, yeah" what?

198
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:26,946
Nothing.

199
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:33,158
Do you want to say something?

200
00:17:39,165 --> 00:17:40,757
I...

201
00:17:46,706 --> 00:17:47,968
...was...

202
00:17:48,975 --> 00:17:52,240
...wondering if you're still
in the Village.

203
00:18:01,388 --> 00:18:03,413
You're such a mystery.

204
00:18:13,667 --> 00:18:15,464
Peter.

205
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,394
What?

206
00:18:23,376 --> 00:18:25,105
Happy birthday.

207
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:35,948
I'm seeing somebody now.

208
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,050
- Therapy.
- No.

209
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,021
A person, a man.

210
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:44,561
You mean, like a boyfriend?

211
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:47,393
Well, like I like him.

212
00:18:50,603 --> 00:18:51,968
What?

213
00:18:52,772 --> 00:18:54,330
Nothing.

214
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:58,439
That's good, you know?
Companionship...

215
00:19:00,146 --> 00:19:01,807
May be more than that.

216
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:04,440
More?

217
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:06,651
I don't know.

218
00:19:07,987 --> 00:19:10,217
I'm coming to see your play
tomorrow night.

219
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:16,228
- You're coming?
- I'll be there.

220
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,892
Don't disappoint me.

221
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,994
I won't.

222
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,740
Rent.

223
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:44,250
- Hi.
- Hi. What's "hi"?

224
00:19:44,424 --> 00:19:45,948
Can I spend it?

225
00:19:46,693 --> 00:19:48,593
I have a paycheck due this week
and...

226
00:19:48,762 --> 00:19:52,095
- You're a month late again. Again.
- I promise as soon as...

227
00:19:52,298 --> 00:19:55,756
If promises were crackers,
my daughter would be fat.

228
00:19:56,369 --> 00:20:00,829
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ditkovitch. All I got
is this 20 for the rest of the week.

229
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,099
"Sorry" doesn't pay the rent.

230
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:08,111
And don't try to sneak past me. I have
ears like a cat and eyes like a rodent.

231
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:12,683
- Thanks, Mr. Ditkovitch.
- Hi, Pete.

232
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,131
Hello?

233
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:17,210
Rent?

234
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:24,688
Doctor? Mr. Osborn's here.

235
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:28,851
Nobel Prize, Otto. Nobel Prize.
And we'll all be rich.

236
00:21:29,028 --> 00:21:30,655
It's not about the prizes, Harry.

237
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,627
But you need money.
You need Oscorp.

238
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,027
Who do we have here?

239
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,929
This is my good friend
I called you about.

240
00:21:36,102 --> 00:21:37,763
He got me through
high-school science.

241
00:21:37,937 --> 00:21:40,997
Peter Parker, sir.
I'm writing a paper on you for...

242
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,607
I know what you're doing here...

243
00:21:42,775 --> 00:21:44,970
...but I don't have time
to talk to students now.

244
00:21:45,945 --> 00:21:47,776
But Oscorp pays the bills, so...

245
00:21:47,947 --> 00:21:50,279
That's why I have to take off.
Board meeting.

246
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:53,817
But my job is done here.
Got you two geniuses together.

247
00:21:53,987 --> 00:21:58,583
Good luck tomorrow, Otto.
Nobel Prize. We'll see you in Sweden!

248
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:02,784
Interesting fellow, your friend.

249
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:05,124
I won't take much of your time.

250
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:09,632
Now I remember you. You're Connors'
student. He tells me you're brilliant.

251
00:22:10,436 --> 00:22:12,529
He also tells me you're lazy.

252
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:14,767
I'm trying to do better.

253
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:18,536
Being brilliant's not enough,
young man. You have to work hard.

254
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:22,041
Intelligence is not a privilege,
it's a gift.

255
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,206
And you use it
for the good of mankind.

256
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,909
Otto, your lunch is ready.

257
00:22:27,086 --> 00:22:28,849
- This is my wife, Rosie.
- Hello.

258
00:22:29,022 --> 00:22:32,514
This is Peter Parker. Connors' student.
The one who falls asleep in class.

259
00:22:32,692 --> 00:22:35,752
I always fell asleep in physics class.

260
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:38,762
- Nice to meet you, Peter.
- Good to meet you.

261
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:40,832
Excuse me.

262
00:22:43,002 --> 00:22:44,230
Is that it?

263
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:48,272
Yes. My design to initiate
and sustain fusion.

264
00:22:48,641 --> 00:22:51,508
I understand you use harmonics
of atomic frequencies.

265
00:22:51,678 --> 00:22:53,043
Sympathetic frequencies.

266
00:22:53,212 --> 00:22:55,237
Harmonic reinforcement?

267
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:57,310
Go on.

268
00:22:57,884 --> 00:23:01,411
An exponential increase
in energy output.

269
00:23:01,587 --> 00:23:03,248
A huge amount of energy.

270
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:07,587
Like a perpetual sun providing
renewable power for the whole world.

271
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,923
It's all so amazing. If it works,
it could change the way we live.

272
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:13,122
It is amazing, and it will work.

273
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:16,826
Are you sure you could stabilize
the fusion reaction?

274
00:23:17,003 --> 00:23:20,666
Peter, what have we been talking
about for the last hour and a half?

275
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,740
This is my life's work.

276
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:26,072
I certainly know the consequences
of the slightest miscalculation.

277
00:23:26,245 --> 00:23:28,475
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to question you.

278
00:23:28,648 --> 00:23:32,049
Rosie, our new friend thinks
I'm gonna blow up the city.

279
00:23:32,218 --> 00:23:34,015
You can sleep soundly tonight.

280
00:23:34,187 --> 00:23:35,916
Otto's done his homework.

281
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:39,183
Come to the demonstration tomorrow,
and you'll see for yourself.

282
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,854
And you need
to sleep soundly tonight, Otto.

283
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:44,223
Did Edison sleep
before he turned on the light?

284
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:46,791
Did Marconi sleep
before he turned on the radio?

285
00:23:47,166 --> 00:23:49,293
Did Beethoven sleep
before he wrote the <i>5th?</i>

286
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,905
Did Bernoulli sleep before he found
the curves of quickest descent?

287
00:23:53,072 --> 00:23:55,438
Rosie, I love this boy.

288
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:59,374
Peter, tell us about yourself.
Do you have a girlfriend?

289
00:24:00,446 --> 00:24:02,004
Well...

290
00:24:03,116 --> 00:24:04,515
I don't really know.

291
00:24:04,684 --> 00:24:07,778
Well, shouldn't you know?
I mean, who would know?

292
00:24:08,021 --> 00:24:10,990
Leave him alone.
Maybe it's a secret love.

293
00:24:11,157 --> 00:24:13,182
Love should never be a secret.

294
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,590
If you keep something as complicated
as love stored up inside...

295
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,857
...gonna make you sick.

296
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,430
I finally got lucky in love.

297
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:22,932
We both did.

298
00:24:23,102 --> 00:24:26,799
But it's hardly perfect.
You have to work at it.

299
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:30,670
I met him on the college steps,
and I knew it wasn't going to be easy.

300
00:24:30,843 --> 00:24:34,108
He was studying science,
and I was studying English literature.

301
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,443
That's right. I was trying to explain
the theory of relativity.

302
00:24:37,617 --> 00:24:39,949
And Rosie was trying
to explain T.S. Eliot.

303
00:24:41,487 --> 00:24:43,921
<i>Time present and time past</i>

304
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,115
- <i>Are both perhaps present</i>
- <i>Perhaps present</i>

305
00:24:46,292 --> 00:24:48,590
- <i>In time future</i>
- <i>In time future</i>

306
00:24:48,761 --> 00:24:50,695
I still don't understand
what he was talking about.

307
00:24:50,863 --> 00:24:52,091
- Yes, you do.
- I'm serious.

308
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:55,792
T.S. Eliot is more complicated
than advanced science.

309
00:24:56,369 --> 00:25:00,328
But if you want to get a woman to fall
in love with you, feed her poetry.

310
00:25:01,074 --> 00:25:02,302
Poetry.

311
00:25:03,943 --> 00:25:05,433
Never fails.

312
00:25:09,949 --> 00:25:12,884
<i>A tall and slender maiden</i>
<i>All alone upon a prairie</i>

313
00:25:13,052 --> 00:25:15,418
<i>Brightest green were all her garments</i>

314
00:25:15,588 --> 00:25:17,954
<i>And her hair was like the sunshine</i>

315
00:25:18,357 --> 00:25:21,019
<i>Day by day he gazed upon her</i>

316
00:26:18,251 --> 00:26:19,878
Rent!

317
00:26:21,787 --> 00:26:23,482
Where is my money?!

318
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:51,446
You seem jittery tonight.

319
00:26:51,617 --> 00:26:53,278
You never know who's coming.

320
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:11,703
Ladies, five minutes. Five minutes.

321
00:27:28,888 --> 00:27:30,219
How'd you do that?

322
00:27:33,226 --> 00:27:35,592
Work out, plenty of rest.

323
00:27:35,761 --> 00:27:37,558
You know, eat your green vegetables.

324
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:41,955
That's what my mom is always saying.
I just never actually believed her.

325
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,135
Come on. Go.

326
00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:50,474
Keep it steady.

327
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:14,489
It's a web.

328
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:17,330
Go, Spidey, go!

329
00:28:25,344 --> 00:28:26,675
We got trouble!

330
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:47,266
Get me down!

331
00:28:50,536 --> 00:28:53,369
I am more than content
with what Mr. Moncrieff said.

332
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:56,838
His voice alone inspires one
with absolute credulity.

333
00:28:57,009 --> 00:28:59,136
Then you think we should
forgive them?

334
00:29:02,014 --> 00:29:03,675
Yes.

335
00:29:04,183 --> 00:29:05,673
I mean, no.

336
00:29:09,989 --> 00:29:14,255
Hey. Hey. Hey, chief.
You park there, I'm towing it.

337
00:29:14,927 --> 00:29:16,258
Whatever.

338
00:29:18,864 --> 00:29:20,456
Shoelace.

339
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,597
You might want to...

340
00:29:32,011 --> 00:29:36,141
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I've come to see the show.

341
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:40,183
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. No one will be
seated after the doors are closed.

342
00:29:41,354 --> 00:29:43,584
It helps maintain the illusion.

343
00:29:45,424 --> 00:29:47,358
I understand.

344
00:29:48,327 --> 00:29:51,763
Miss Watson, she's a friend of mine.
She asked me to come.

345
00:29:51,931 --> 00:29:53,421
But not to come late.

346
00:29:55,868 --> 00:29:59,326
I have to see this show.
Just let me in, I'll stand in the...

347
00:30:09,048 --> 00:30:10,606
Listen, can't you...?

348
00:30:25,231 --> 00:30:28,166
<i>A Spider-Man</i>
<i>A Spider-Man</i>

349
00:30:28,334 --> 00:30:31,326
<i>A- does whatever a spider can</i>

350
00:30:31,504 --> 00:30:34,496
<i>A- spins a web, any size</i>

351
00:30:34,673 --> 00:30:37,039
<i>Catches thieves a-just like flies</i>

352
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:40,440
<i>Look out</i>
<i>Here comes the Spider-Man</i>

353
00:30:56,295 --> 00:30:58,855
You sure you don't wanna
come tonight?

354
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:00,396
Yeah, I'm sure.

355
00:31:00,566 --> 00:31:02,466
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.

356
00:31:02,635 --> 00:31:04,364
- You were great tonight.
- Thanks.

357
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:09,433
May I have an autograph,
please, miss?

358
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,074
What are you doing here?

359
00:31:27,226 --> 00:31:28,454
You hungry?

360
00:31:28,627 --> 00:31:29,855
Starved.

361
00:32:20,446 --> 00:32:22,414
What was that?

362
00:32:26,886 --> 00:32:28,649
Okay.

363
00:33:04,189 --> 00:33:05,986
How you doing?

364
00:33:06,592 --> 00:33:08,059
Good.

365
00:33:10,563 --> 00:33:14,158
I just wanna say,
I really like what you do.

366
00:33:14,833 --> 00:33:17,131
- Think it's great.
- Thanks.

367
00:33:18,304 --> 00:33:21,467
I'm with Weisenhower,
Anderson, Nichols & Knudsen...

368
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,335
...PR firm in the building...

369
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:26,342
...and I just wanna say I think
the image you have is fantastic.

370
00:33:26,512 --> 00:33:29,345
It's really put together.
The costume. The... this thing.

371
00:33:29,515 --> 00:33:32,643
I mean, it's really put together.
It's great.

372
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,054
I think you could do more
than print though.

373
00:33:37,222 --> 00:33:39,952
I think you might wanna try some TV,
you know?

374
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:42,286
Can I riff for you?
Come up with a couple ideas?

375
00:33:42,461 --> 00:33:45,225
Just what my company would do?
Let's see, what do I got?

376
00:33:45,397 --> 00:33:48,127
How about a children's book?
You could...

377
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:51,133
Like <i>Charlotte's Web</i>,
but without the pig. That kind of thing.

378
00:33:51,303 --> 00:33:53,669
How about a line of hammocks?

379
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,171
Because it's kind of a web thing.

380
00:33:56,342 --> 00:34:00,779
You could do a men's cologne
called Thwip.

381
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,575
Let me give you a card.

382
00:34:03,749 --> 00:34:06,547
I don't have any pockets.

383
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:08,152
Yeah.

384
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:13,016
Well, we're right in the building.

385
00:34:23,636 --> 00:34:26,104
That doesn't help.
I do that all the time.

386
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,964
- Slow elevator.
- Yeah.

387
00:34:51,563 --> 00:34:54,031
Thus, the second-order term...

388
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,929
...in the expansion of
the exact order...

389
00:34:57,102 --> 00:35:00,435
...is identical to the second order...

390
00:35:00,606 --> 00:35:04,098
...calculated from first-order
perturbation energy.

391
00:35:04,276 --> 00:35:07,336
Since we are free to choose
an arbitrary origin for our energy...

392
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:33,465
<i>Hi. It's me.</i>
<i>Sing your song at the beep.</i>

393
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:35,567
Hi, M.J.

394
00:35:35,741 --> 00:35:37,038
This is Peter.

395
00:35:37,576 --> 00:35:40,636
<i>I was on my way to your show and...</i>

396
00:35:41,947 --> 00:35:45,383
<i>Well, I was on my bike...</i>

397
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:49,911
<i>Are you there?</i>

398
00:35:52,558 --> 00:35:55,425
I really was planning on it all day.

399
00:35:56,695 --> 00:35:58,253
And...

400
00:35:59,665 --> 00:36:01,997
...I know you predicted
I'd disappoint you.

401
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:03,961
Bingo.

402
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,665
<i>It's amazing, isn't it?</i>

403
00:36:07,573 --> 00:36:10,440
<i>How complicated a simple thing...</i>

404
00:36:11,643 --> 00:36:15,739
<i>... like being someplace at 8:00</i>
<i>can become.</i>

405
00:36:19,551 --> 00:36:23,487
<i>Actually, there was</i>
<i>this obnoxious usher.</i>

406
00:36:24,156 --> 00:36:27,284
Somebody has to talk
to that usher, M.J.

407
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:28,983
<i>Your time has expired.</i>

408
00:36:29,161 --> 00:36:33,427
<i>Please deposit 50 cents</i>
<i>for the next five minutes.</i>

409
00:36:43,108 --> 00:36:45,201
I wanna tell you the truth.

410
00:36:47,346 --> 00:36:48,779
Here it is.

411
00:36:49,815 --> 00:36:51,442
I'm Spider-Man.

412
00:36:52,618 --> 00:36:53,983
Weird, huh?

413
00:36:55,854 --> 00:36:58,152
Now you know
why I can't be with you.

414
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:03,955
If my enemies found out about you...

415
00:37:06,799 --> 00:37:10,030
...if you got hurt,
I could never forgive myself.

416
00:37:15,908 --> 00:37:18,900
I wish I could tell you
how I feel about you.

417
00:37:30,422 --> 00:37:31,684
Ladies and gentlemen...

418
00:37:31,857 --> 00:37:35,691
...my wife Rosie and I would like to
welcome you this afternoon.

419
00:37:35,861 --> 00:37:37,522
But first, before we start...

420
00:37:37,696 --> 00:37:42,065
...has anybody lost a large roll
of 20-dollar bills in a rubber band?

421
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:43,991
Because we found the rubber band.

422
00:37:48,674 --> 00:37:50,107
It's a terrible joke.

423
00:37:50,275 --> 00:37:52,004
But thank you for coming.

424
00:37:52,344 --> 00:37:53,572
Today...

425
00:37:53,745 --> 00:37:58,273
...you will witness the birth
of a new fusion-based energy source.

426
00:37:58,584 --> 00:38:03,783
Safe, renewable energy
and cheap electricity for everyone.

427
00:38:05,123 --> 00:38:08,388
And now let me introduce
my assistants.

428
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:19,060
These four actuators were
developed and programmed...

429
00:38:19,238 --> 00:38:22,696
...for the sole purpose of creating
successful fusion.

430
00:38:22,875 --> 00:38:25,400
They are impervious to heat
and magnetism.

431
00:39:10,088 --> 00:39:14,855
These smart arms are controlled
by my brain through a neural link.

432
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,258
Nanowires feed directly
into my cerebellum...

433
00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:22,526
...allowing me to use these arms
to control fusion reaction...

434
00:39:22,701 --> 00:39:25,534
...in an environment
no human hand could enter.

435
00:39:25,704 --> 00:39:28,138
Doctor, if the artificial intelligence
in the arms...

436
00:39:28,307 --> 00:39:30,104
...is as advanced as you suggest...

437
00:39:30,275 --> 00:39:32,300
...couldn't that make you
vulnerable to them?

438
00:39:32,477 --> 00:39:33,739
How right you are.

439
00:39:33,912 --> 00:39:35,971
Which is why I developed
this inhibitor chip...

440
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:38,514
...to protect
my higher brain function.

441
00:39:38,684 --> 00:39:43,053
It means I maintain control of these
arms, instead of them controlling me.

442
00:39:43,956 --> 00:39:45,787
And now on to the main event.

443
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:47,858
Give me the blue light, Rosie.

444
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:11,313
Precious tritium is the fuel
that makes this project go.

445
00:40:11,483 --> 00:40:14,611
There's only 25 pounds of it
on the whole planet.

446
00:40:15,253 --> 00:40:19,519
I'd like to thank Harry Osborn and
Oscorp Industries for providing it.

447
00:40:19,691 --> 00:40:21,420
Happy to pay the bills, Otto.

448
00:40:35,374 --> 00:40:36,773
Ladies and gentlemen...

449
00:40:39,444 --> 00:40:41,275
...fasten your seat belts.

450
00:41:00,065 --> 00:41:02,625
Doctor, we have
a successful fusion reaction.

451
00:41:07,406 --> 00:41:10,739
This is a breakthrough
beyond your father's dreams.

452
00:41:10,909 --> 00:41:12,137
Thank you.

453
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:14,244
We're producing
a thousand-megawatt surplus.

454
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,751
The power of the sun...

455
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:26,516
...in the palm of my hand.

456
00:41:48,146 --> 00:41:50,706
Keep calm! It's only a spike!

457
00:41:50,882 --> 00:41:52,713
It'll soon stabilize!

458
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,291
Ladies and gentlemen,
please clear the room.

459
00:42:06,965 --> 00:42:08,296
We have a containment breach!

460
00:42:11,069 --> 00:42:13,128
Otto, please get back!

461
00:42:14,172 --> 00:42:16,970
Shut it off, Otto! Shut it off!

462
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:19,969
It will stabilize! It's under control!

463
00:42:20,145 --> 00:42:22,010
I'm in charge here!

464
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,047
It's my money! I'm in con...

465
00:42:28,653 --> 00:42:30,678
This doesn't change anything.

466
00:42:33,992 --> 00:42:36,358
- What are you doing?
- Pulling the plug.

467
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:38,023
No!

468
00:42:56,982 --> 00:42:58,540
Rosie!

469
00:43:29,181 --> 00:43:30,409
Watch it.

470
00:43:30,582 --> 00:43:31,810
That was too close.

471
00:43:31,983 --> 00:43:36,044
If he had more than a drop of tritium,
he could have destroyed the city.

472
00:43:41,459 --> 00:43:42,858
I'm ruined.

473
00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:47,020
I have nothing left,
except Spider-Man.

474
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:48,860
He saved your life, sir.

475
00:43:49,301 --> 00:43:51,701
He humiliated me by touching me.

476
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:54,464
The press will be here soon.
I suggest we move on.

477
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:56,539
What was he doing here anyway?

478
00:44:12,991 --> 00:44:15,391
Molten metal penetrated
the spinal cavity...

479
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,687
...and fused the vertebrae
at multiple points...

480
00:44:17,862 --> 00:44:20,422
...including the lamina
and the roof of the spinal column.

481
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:22,760
We won't know the extent of
the damage until we get in there.

482
00:44:22,934 --> 00:44:25,903
I suggest we cut off these mechanical
arms, slice up the harness...

483
00:44:26,071 --> 00:44:28,437
...and, if need be,
consider a laminectomy...

484
00:44:28,607 --> 00:44:31,872
...with posterior spinal fusion
from C 7-T1 to T12.

485
00:44:32,143 --> 00:44:33,440
We're ready, doctor.

486
00:44:36,748 --> 00:44:38,579
Anybody here take shop class?

487
00:45:17,489 --> 00:45:19,150
No! No! No!

488
00:45:22,227 --> 00:45:24,559
Help me! Help me!

489
00:46:37,702 --> 00:46:41,194
No!

490
00:47:32,757 --> 00:47:35,624
It's all over town, Robbie.
Gossip. Rumors.

491
00:47:35,794 --> 00:47:37,955
Panic in the streets, if we're lucky.

492
00:47:38,129 --> 00:47:40,927
Crazy scientist turns himself
into some kind of a monster.

493
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:44,091
Four mechanical arms welded
right onto his body.

494
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:49,233
Guy named Otto Octavius winds up
with eight limbs. What are the odds?

495
00:47:49,407 --> 00:47:50,635
Hoffman!

496
00:47:52,677 --> 00:47:54,144
What are we gonna call this guy?

497
00:47:54,312 --> 00:47:56,542
- "Dr. Octopus."
- That's crap.

498
00:47:56,714 --> 00:47:58,272
- "Science Squid"?
- Crap!

499
00:47:58,883 --> 00:48:00,544
- "Dr. Strange."
- That's pretty good.

500
00:48:01,352 --> 00:48:05,550
But it's taken.
Wait, wait! I got it. "Dr. Octopus."

501
00:48:06,324 --> 00:48:08,019
- I like it.
- Of course you do.

502
00:48:08,193 --> 00:48:11,993
Dr. Octopus. New villain in town.
"Doc Ock."

503
00:48:12,163 --> 00:48:14,097
- Genius.
- What, are you looking for a raise?

504
00:48:14,265 --> 00:48:15,926
Get out.

505
00:48:16,634 --> 00:48:17,896
Chief, I found Parker.

506
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:20,264
Where you been?
Why don't you pay your phone bill.

507
00:48:20,438 --> 00:48:22,770
Mad scientist goes berserk,
we don't have pictures!

508
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:24,238
I heard Spider-Man was there.

509
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:28,004
Where were you?
Photographing squirrels? You're fired.

510
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:29,510
Chief, the planetarium party.

511
00:48:29,681 --> 00:48:31,342
You're un-fired.
I need you, come here.

512
00:48:31,516 --> 00:48:33,074
What do you know
about high society?

513
00:48:33,251 --> 00:48:35,549
- Oh. Well, I...
- Don't answer that.

514
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:39,156
My society photographer got hit in the
head by a polo ball. You're all I got.

515
00:48:39,324 --> 00:48:42,293
Big party for an American hero.
My son, the astronaut.

516
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:44,223
Could you pay me in advance?

517
00:48:53,271 --> 00:48:55,739
You serious? Pay you for what?
Standing there?

518
00:48:55,907 --> 00:48:58,535
The planetarium, tomorrow night,
8:00. There's the door.

519
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:15,354
My Rosie's dead.

520
00:49:17,529 --> 00:49:19,292
My dream is dead.

521
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,263
And these...

522
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:29,763
...monstrous things should be
at the bottom of the river...

523
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:34,009
...along with me.

524
00:49:42,954 --> 00:49:44,581
Something...

525
00:49:46,057 --> 00:49:47,547
...in my head.

526
00:49:51,229 --> 00:49:52,787
Something talking.

527
00:49:56,834 --> 00:49:58,301
The inhibitor chip!

528
00:50:01,706 --> 00:50:03,264
Gone.

529
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,343
Rebuild.

530
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,411
No.

531
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,053
Peter was right.

532
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:20,982
I miscalculated.

533
00:50:27,565 --> 00:50:29,624
I couldn't have miscalculated.

534
00:50:30,735 --> 00:50:32,669
It was working, wasn't it?

535
00:50:37,575 --> 00:50:38,974
Yes.

536
00:50:40,044 --> 00:50:43,036
We could rebuild.
Enlarge the containment field.

537
00:50:43,214 --> 00:50:45,478
Make it bigger
and stronger than ever.

538
00:50:46,351 --> 00:50:48,182
But we need money.

539
00:50:49,954 --> 00:50:51,285
Steal it?

540
00:50:51,456 --> 00:50:53,219
No, no, no, I'm not a criminal.

541
00:50:55,893 --> 00:50:57,224
That's right.

542
00:50:59,130 --> 00:51:02,361
The real crime would be not to finish
what we started.

543
00:51:06,004 --> 00:51:07,631
We'll do it here.

544
00:51:08,373 --> 00:51:11,672
The power of the sun
in the palm of my hand.

545
00:51:11,976 --> 00:51:14,467
Nothing will stand in our way.

546
00:51:14,646 --> 00:51:15,977
Nothing!

547
00:51:21,386 --> 00:51:24,048
- That's the social security.
- Yes, I see.

548
00:51:24,222 --> 00:51:25,985
My uncle Ben's life insurance.

549
00:51:26,157 --> 00:51:28,421
Yes, but I'm afraid...

550
00:51:28,593 --> 00:51:31,653
...it's just not sufficient
to refinance your home.

551
00:51:31,963 --> 00:51:35,455
Oh, but I'm giving
piano lessons again.

552
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:36,998
You are?

553
00:51:42,073 --> 00:51:45,304
We appreciate
that you've just opened up...

554
00:51:45,476 --> 00:51:48,070
...a new supersaver account
with us today.

555
00:51:48,246 --> 00:51:49,508
But the fact is...

556
00:51:49,681 --> 00:51:54,015
...you do not have the assets
to justify this loan. I'm sorry.

557
00:51:54,652 --> 00:51:56,210
Well...

558
00:51:57,989 --> 00:51:59,820
At least we get the toaster.

559
00:51:59,991 --> 00:52:04,018
Actually, that's only
with a deposit of 300 or more.

560
00:52:06,864 --> 00:52:08,195
Oh, yes, I see.

561
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:11,294
Okay.

562
00:52:14,372 --> 00:52:16,465
Don't worry, we'll figure it out.

563
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:35,122
Peter?

564
00:52:36,961 --> 00:52:38,929
Don't leave me.

565
00:52:39,731 --> 00:52:42,165
Oh, that boy of yours is a real hero.

566
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:43,895
Hold it!

567
00:52:44,669 --> 00:52:47,331
Put your arms up! All of them!

568
00:53:10,661 --> 00:53:11,992
Here's your change!

569
00:53:21,906 --> 00:53:23,430
Oh, no. Come on!

570
00:53:36,854 --> 00:53:39,049
- You're getting on my nerves.
- I have a knack for that.

571
00:53:39,223 --> 00:53:40,815
Not anymore.

572
00:54:10,555 --> 00:54:12,352
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Freeze!

573
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,125
- Hold your fire!
- Don't follow me.

574
00:54:22,033 --> 00:54:23,796
Wait a second.

575
00:54:41,552 --> 00:54:43,782
- Hand her over.
- Of course.

576
00:54:44,555 --> 00:54:45,817
Easy, now.

577
00:54:47,525 --> 00:54:49,220
Butterfingers.

578
00:55:01,505 --> 00:55:02,767
Look out!

579
00:55:04,909 --> 00:55:06,900
Help me!

580
00:55:09,013 --> 00:55:11,607
- Help me!
- I'm coming!

581
00:55:16,854 --> 00:55:18,754
Hang on!

582
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:51,920
Help!

583
00:56:17,048 --> 00:56:18,709
Thank you.

584
00:56:21,953 --> 00:56:23,284
Aunt May.

585
00:56:23,454 --> 00:56:26,446
You've stuck your webs
in my business for the last time.

586
00:56:26,624 --> 00:56:29,650
Now you'll have this woman's death
on your conscience.

587
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:36,826
Come on.

588
00:56:40,805 --> 00:56:42,932
Shame on you.

589
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:16,866
There you go.

590
00:57:17,842 --> 00:57:21,175
Thank you.
Oh, have I been wrong about you.

591
00:57:21,345 --> 00:57:22,607
We sure showed him.

592
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,577
What do you mean, "we"?

593
00:57:28,686 --> 00:57:31,086
- Take me with you, Spider-Man.
- Take me.

594
00:57:58,616 --> 00:58:01,278
- May I?
- Sure. Go ahead.

595
00:58:02,286 --> 00:58:04,186
Penny! Over here!

596
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,084
Leave it.

597
00:58:15,132 --> 00:58:17,623
Hey. Might wanna take it easy, buddy.

598
00:58:17,802 --> 00:58:19,133
Why? It's a party.

599
00:58:19,303 --> 00:58:22,238
Wouldn't you be drinking if you lost
a bundle on some crackpot...

600
00:58:22,406 --> 00:58:25,739
...who you thought was gonna take
you with him to fame and fortune?

601
00:58:26,143 --> 00:58:27,770
Not to mention your friend the bug.

602
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,573
Not tonight, Harry.

603
00:58:29,747 --> 00:58:33,274
Every night!
Until I find him, it's 24-7.

604
00:58:33,751 --> 00:58:35,184
Parker!

605
00:58:35,853 --> 00:58:37,081
Parker!

606
00:58:37,621 --> 00:58:40,681
Parker! What, are you deaf?
I called you twice.

607
00:58:40,858 --> 00:58:42,849
Think I'm paying you
to sip champagne?

608
00:58:43,027 --> 00:58:44,961
Get a shot of my wife
with the minister.

609
00:58:45,396 --> 00:58:46,658
Beautiful tie.

610
00:58:46,831 --> 00:58:49,095
Get a shot of us with the DA.

611
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,990
Beautiful dress.

612
00:58:51,435 --> 00:58:54,165
Here, get a shot of the mayor
and his girlfriend.

613
00:58:55,506 --> 00:58:57,098
Wife.

614
00:58:59,076 --> 00:59:01,340
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

615
00:59:01,512 --> 00:59:04,606
The committee for
the Science Library of New York...

616
00:59:04,782 --> 00:59:06,977
...is pleased to present
our guest of honor.

617
00:59:07,151 --> 00:59:10,917
He's the first man to play football
on the moon.

618
00:59:12,022 --> 00:59:15,185
The handsome, the heroic,
the delicious...

619
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,224
...Captain John Jameson.

620
01:00:01,906 --> 01:00:03,430
Hi.

621
01:00:05,743 --> 01:00:09,110
- You.
- Listen, I'm sorry.

622
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,510
But there was a disturbance.

623
01:00:11,682 --> 01:00:12,979
I don't know you.

624
01:00:14,952 --> 01:00:18,854
And I can't keep thinking about you.
It's too painful.

625
01:00:19,757 --> 01:00:21,418
I've been reading poetry lately.

626
01:00:21,592 --> 01:00:22,957
Whatever that means.

627
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,952
<i>Day by day he gazed upon her</i>

628
01:00:27,398 --> 01:00:30,231
<i>Day by day he sighed with passion</i>
<i>Day by day</i>...

629
01:00:30,401 --> 01:00:32,266
Don't start.

630
01:00:33,737 --> 01:00:35,534
Can I get you a drink?

631
01:00:35,706 --> 01:00:37,435
I'm with John. He'll get me my drink.

632
01:00:38,108 --> 01:00:39,735
John.

633
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:43,812
By the way, John has seen
my show five times.

634
01:00:43,981 --> 01:00:46,950
Harry has seen it twice.
Aunt May has seen it.

635
01:00:47,117 --> 01:00:49,608
My sick mother got out of bed to see it.

636
01:00:49,787 --> 01:00:51,015
Even my father.

637
01:00:52,256 --> 01:00:54,952
He came backstage to borrow cash.

638
01:00:56,594 --> 01:01:00,963
But my best friend,
who cares so much about me...

639
01:01:01,131 --> 01:01:03,292
...can't make an 8:00 curtain.

640
01:01:04,969 --> 01:01:06,561
After all these years...

641
01:01:07,871 --> 01:01:10,465
...he's nothing to me
but an empty seat.

642
01:01:35,966 --> 01:01:39,333
It pisses me off, your loyalty to
Spider-Man and not to your best friend.

643
01:01:39,503 --> 01:01:42,768
I find him with my father's body,
and you defend him.

644
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,999
- Take it easy.
- Don't push me.

645
01:01:45,175 --> 01:01:46,972
Don't act like you're my friend.

646
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:49,713
You stole M.J. From me.

647
01:01:50,114 --> 01:01:52,014
You stole my father's love.

648
01:01:52,683 --> 01:01:57,677
Then you let him die because you
didn't turn in the freak. Isn't that right?

649
01:01:58,922 --> 01:02:01,152
Huh? Isn't that right?

650
01:02:01,325 --> 01:02:03,122
Huh, brother?

651
01:02:14,104 --> 01:02:16,834
Ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you all to know...

652
01:02:17,541 --> 01:02:22,001
...that the beautiful Miss Mary Jane
Watson has just agreed to marry me.

653
01:02:32,523 --> 01:02:33,990
What a surprise.

654
01:02:34,158 --> 01:02:37,093
Parker, wake up! Wake up!
Shoot the picture!

655
01:03:04,154 --> 01:03:06,486
Oh, no. No!

656
01:03:17,501 --> 01:03:19,662
Why is this happening to me?

657
01:04:42,953 --> 01:04:45,547
You told him yes? Just that fast?

658
01:04:45,722 --> 01:04:47,155
It felt right.

659
01:04:48,091 --> 01:04:50,059
Well, you might congratulate me.

660
01:04:50,227 --> 01:04:52,127
Congratulations.

661
01:04:52,296 --> 01:04:54,389
Good luck in the world.

662
01:04:55,732 --> 01:04:57,563
John loves me.

663
01:04:57,734 --> 01:05:01,431
My father always said,
"You'll never be worth anything.

664
01:05:01,605 --> 01:05:03,197
No man will ever want you."

665
01:05:03,373 --> 01:05:05,705
So, what, you're gonna spend
the rest of your life...

666
01:05:05,876 --> 01:05:09,107
...trying to prove something
to your father?

667
01:05:09,279 --> 01:05:11,304
Do you really love this guy?

668
01:05:12,049 --> 01:05:14,609
- Very much.
- "Very much"?

669
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:16,275
That just doesn't fly.

670
01:05:16,453 --> 01:05:18,887
I mean, if you really love the guy,
then the answer is:

671
01:05:19,056 --> 01:05:20,956
"Do I love him? I adore him.

672
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,623
He's my comfortable afghan.

673
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:25,989
He's all I can think about.

674
01:05:26,163 --> 01:05:30,224
Everything he is, everything he says,
everything he does...

675
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,497
...to me, for me, with me,
is sweet kisses.

676
01:05:36,974 --> 01:05:39,772
He makes up for all the grief
and pain I've ever had...

677
01:05:39,943 --> 01:05:42,912
...and in the dark of the night,
he is there."

678
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,844
That's the answer I need.

679
01:05:46,016 --> 01:05:48,849
Not just "I love him very much."

680
01:05:50,787 --> 01:05:53,347
You read too many love stories.

681
01:05:53,524 --> 01:05:55,822
What about that perfect kiss
you said you had once?

682
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:58,484
- The guy you believed in?
- That was a fantasy.

683
01:05:58,662 --> 01:06:00,027
That's all he is.

684
01:06:00,197 --> 01:06:02,688
But what's wrong with believing
in love stories?

685
01:06:13,243 --> 01:06:15,211
You seem very okay to me.

686
01:06:15,913 --> 01:06:17,278
My diagnosis?

687
01:06:17,781 --> 01:06:19,248
It's up here.

688
01:06:21,952 --> 01:06:25,979
You say you can't sleep.
Heartbreak? Bad dreams?

689
01:06:27,157 --> 01:06:29,887
There is one dream where...

690
01:06:30,327 --> 01:06:31,794
...in my dream...

691
01:06:32,963 --> 01:06:34,328
...l'm Spider-Man.

692
01:06:34,731 --> 01:06:39,293
But I'm losing my powers.
I'm climbing a wall, but I keep falling.

693
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:44,465
So you're Spider-Man.

694
01:06:44,641 --> 01:06:45,869
In my dream.

695
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:50,446
Actually, it's not even my dream.
It's a friend of mine's dream.

696
01:06:50,614 --> 01:06:52,741
So it's somebody else's dream.

697
01:06:54,818 --> 01:06:57,810
- What's your major? Theater Arts?
- Science.

698
01:06:58,021 --> 01:06:59,249
Connors?

699
01:06:59,423 --> 01:07:01,015
He flunking you?

700
01:07:01,191 --> 01:07:02,658
He says he might.

701
01:07:03,126 --> 01:07:04,753
There you go.

702
01:07:13,437 --> 01:07:15,337
What about this friend?

703
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:19,372
Why does he climb these walls?
What does he think of himself?

704
01:07:19,876 --> 01:07:23,812
That's the problem.
He doesn't know what to think.

705
01:07:24,448 --> 01:07:28,214
Gotta make you mad not to know
who you are. Your soul disappears.

706
01:07:28,385 --> 01:07:30,148
Nothing as bad as uncertainty.

707
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:33,981
I've been there. Who was I?

708
01:07:36,727 --> 01:07:39,287
Identity. Big one.

709
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:42,762
Me, I go to my shrink.

710
01:07:44,368 --> 01:07:45,392
What does he tell you?

711
01:07:45,569 --> 01:07:50,199
She tells me I need some
strong focus on what I want.

712
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:54,977
And I have to find out
who won't let me have it, why...

713
01:07:55,879 --> 01:08:00,873
...and then I have to tackle that guy,
let him hear me...

714
01:08:01,051 --> 01:08:04,885
And one more thing. I have to
make sure I'm right about what I want.

715
01:08:07,057 --> 01:08:08,547
Listen...

716
01:08:08,725 --> 01:08:12,991
...maybe you're not supposed to be
Spider-Man climbing those walls.

717
01:08:13,397 --> 01:08:15,126
That's why you keep falling.

718
01:08:17,601 --> 01:08:19,535
You always have a choice, Peter.

719
01:08:21,772 --> 01:08:23,467
I have a choice.

720
01:08:32,582 --> 01:08:35,574
<i>All the things you've</i>
<i>been thinking about, Peter...</i>

721
01:08:36,687 --> 01:08:38,120
<i>... make me sad.</i>

722
01:08:39,623 --> 01:08:41,557
Can't you understand?

723
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:44,453
I'm in love with Mary Jane.

724
01:08:44,628 --> 01:08:47,597
You know I understand.

725
01:08:48,532 --> 01:08:52,366
But I thought you'd learned
the meaning of responsibility.

726
01:08:54,071 --> 01:08:56,801
Oh, you don't know how it feels.

727
01:08:58,842 --> 01:09:01,936
Peter, all the times
we've talked of honesty...

728
01:09:03,046 --> 01:09:06,140
...fairness, justice...

729
01:09:06,450 --> 01:09:11,183
Out of those times,
I counted on you to have the courage...

730
01:09:11,455 --> 01:09:15,289
...to take those dreams
out into the world.

731
01:09:16,393 --> 01:09:18,953
I can't live your dreams anymore.

732
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:21,961
I want a life of my own.

733
01:09:22,132 --> 01:09:24,259
You've been given a gift, Peter.

734
01:09:24,568 --> 01:09:28,834
With great power
comes great responsibility.

735
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:35,071
Take my hand, son.

736
01:09:48,258 --> 01:09:49,987
No, Uncle Ben.

737
01:09:52,095 --> 01:09:54,325
I'm just Peter Parker.

738
01:09:56,099 --> 01:09:57,828
I'm Spider-Man...

739
01:09:58,702 --> 01:10:00,294
...no more.

740
01:10:01,404 --> 01:10:02,803
No more.

741
01:10:11,047 --> 01:10:12,514
No more.

742
01:11:41,872 --> 01:11:43,806
- You punk!
- Sorry.

743
01:11:44,374 --> 01:11:46,239
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

744
01:11:53,683 --> 01:11:54,911
Hurry up!

745
01:12:04,694 --> 01:12:08,391
And when the borderline is tau
equals zero, the eigenvalues are...?

746
01:12:08,565 --> 01:12:10,430
Someone, please?

747
01:12:12,535 --> 01:12:14,765
.23 electron volts.

748
01:12:20,043 --> 01:12:22,910
Excellent work today, Parker.
Keep it up.

749
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:36,423
I'm not really wicked at all.
You mustn't think that I'm wicked.

750
01:12:36,593 --> 01:12:39,426
If you are not, then you have
certainly been deceiving us all...

751
01:12:39,596 --> 01:12:41,564
...in a very inexcusable manner.

752
01:12:41,731 --> 01:12:43,892
I hope you have not been
leading a double life...

753
01:12:44,067 --> 01:12:47,264
...pretending to be wicked
and being really good all the time.

754
01:12:47,437 --> 01:12:49,200
That would be hypocrisy.

755
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:52,640
Of course, I have been
rather reckless.

756
01:12:58,448 --> 01:12:59,938
"I am glad."

757
01:13:00,784 --> 01:13:02,718
"I am glad."

758
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:04,814
"I am glad."

759
01:13:06,723 --> 01:13:08,850
Are you glad to hear it?

760
01:13:11,061 --> 01:13:13,393
I am glad...

761
01:13:13,563 --> 01:13:14,996
...to hear it.

762
01:13:15,165 --> 01:13:16,860
In fact, now you mention
the subject...

763
01:13:17,033 --> 01:13:20,696
...I have been very bad
in my own small way.

764
01:13:22,639 --> 01:13:25,608
You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

765
01:13:25,775 --> 01:13:27,800
You could've told me
you were coming.

766
01:13:27,978 --> 01:13:30,310
I was afraid you'd say,
"Don't come."

767
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:35,711
You look different.

768
01:13:36,453 --> 01:13:41,390
I shined my shoes, pressed my pants,
did my homework.

769
01:13:41,558 --> 01:13:43,423
I do my homework now.

770
01:13:45,562 --> 01:13:47,393
You wanna get some chow mein?

771
01:13:47,564 --> 01:13:48,963
Peter...

772
01:13:49,399 --> 01:13:50,991
...l'm getting married.

773
01:13:55,905 --> 01:13:58,738
I always imagined you
getting married on a hilltop.

774
01:13:59,109 --> 01:14:00,770
And who's the groom?

775
01:14:01,111 --> 01:14:02,806
You hadn't decided yet.

776
01:14:05,248 --> 01:14:07,341
You think just because
you saw my play...

777
01:14:07,517 --> 01:14:09,917
...you can talk me out
of getting married?

778
01:14:10,186 --> 01:14:13,383
You once told me you loved me.
I let things get in the way before.

779
01:14:13,556 --> 01:14:17,048
There was something I thought
I had to do. I don't have to.

780
01:14:17,527 --> 01:14:19,085
You're too late.

781
01:14:20,196 --> 01:14:21,561
Will you think about it?

782
01:14:21,731 --> 01:14:23,062
Think about what?

783
01:14:23,233 --> 01:14:25,224
Picking up where we left off.

784
01:14:25,435 --> 01:14:26,732
Where was that?

785
01:14:26,903 --> 01:14:29,394
We never got on.
You can't get off if you don't get on.

786
01:14:29,572 --> 01:14:30,971
I don't think it's that simple.

787
01:14:31,141 --> 01:14:33,405
Of course you don't,
because you complicate things.

788
01:14:33,576 --> 01:14:35,203
You don't understand.

789
01:14:35,712 --> 01:14:38,146
I'm not an empty seat anymore.

790
01:14:38,715 --> 01:14:40,114
I'm different.

791
01:14:40,717 --> 01:14:42,708
Punch me, I bleed.

792
01:14:49,993 --> 01:14:51,483
I have to go.

793
01:14:58,568 --> 01:15:00,798
I'm getting married in a church.

794
01:15:08,511 --> 01:15:10,103
You are different.

795
01:15:24,928 --> 01:15:28,193
Dear, we agreed to put on a wedding,
not go into bankruptcy.

796
01:15:28,865 --> 01:15:31,459
Caviar?
What, are we inviting the czar?

797
01:15:31,634 --> 01:15:34,660
Get some cheese and crackers,
some of those little cocktail weenies.

798
01:15:34,838 --> 01:15:38,001
I got a garbage man here says he's
got something you might want to see.

799
01:15:38,174 --> 01:15:41,871
If you have an extraterrestrial's head in
there, you're the third guy this week.

800
01:15:44,414 --> 01:15:46,245
Where the hell did you get that?

801
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:47,940
In the garbage.

802
01:15:48,118 --> 01:15:49,551
In the garbage?

803
01:15:51,554 --> 01:15:53,215
He must've given up.

804
01:15:53,623 --> 01:15:58,356
Thrown in the towel.
Abandoned his sad little masquerade.

805
01:15:59,195 --> 01:16:02,323
I finally got to him.
The power of the press triumphs.

806
01:16:02,499 --> 01:16:07,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Now, look, I think
I deserve a little something for this.

807
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:10,564
- Give you 50 bucks.
- I could get more than that on eBay.

808
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:13,800
All right, 100. Give this man his
money and throw in a bar of soap.

809
01:16:14,611 --> 01:16:16,579
Your wife is still on that line.

810
01:16:17,981 --> 01:16:19,744
Flowers? How much?

811
01:16:20,383 --> 01:16:23,580
You spend any more on this thing,
you can pick the daisies off my grave.

812
01:16:23,753 --> 01:16:24,981
Get plastic.

813
01:16:26,122 --> 01:16:27,749
Gotta go, big story.

814
01:16:38,835 --> 01:16:42,100
<i>Spider-Man</i>
<i>Spider-Man</i>

815
01:16:42,272 --> 01:16:45,264
<i>Where have you gone to</i>
<i>Spider-Man?</i>

816
01:16:45,441 --> 01:16:48,842
<i>Where have you gone to</i>
<i>Spider-Man?</i>

817
01:17:20,643 --> 01:17:22,975
Come on, man. Get the money.

818
01:17:24,647 --> 01:17:26,478
Come on, come on.

819
01:17:28,851 --> 01:17:30,341
Help!

820
01:17:34,290 --> 01:17:35,518
Come on!

821
01:17:42,098 --> 01:17:44,328
It wasn't fair to have gone like that.

822
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:46,661
He was a peaceful man.

823
01:17:48,705 --> 01:17:50,935
And it was all my doing.

824
01:18:23,773 --> 01:18:27,209
Aunt May.
You don't have to punish yourself.

825
01:18:27,377 --> 01:18:29,402
Oh, I know I shouldn't.

826
01:18:29,779 --> 01:18:32,976
It's just that you wanted
to take the subway...

827
01:18:33,149 --> 01:18:35,310
...and he wanted to drive you.

828
01:18:35,652 --> 01:18:38,177
If only I had stopped him.

829
01:18:38,655 --> 01:18:41,818
We'd all three of us
be having tea together.

830
01:18:57,573 --> 01:18:59,097
I'm responsible.

831
01:19:02,912 --> 01:19:04,277
For what?

832
01:19:05,281 --> 01:19:07,476
For what happened to Uncle Ben.

833
01:19:07,650 --> 01:19:09,914
But you were at the library.

834
01:19:10,086 --> 01:19:12,054
You were doing your homework.

835
01:19:12,221 --> 01:19:15,349
He drove me to the library,
but I never went in.

836
01:19:16,192 --> 01:19:17,819
What do you mean?

837
01:19:18,561 --> 01:19:20,222
I went someplace else.

838
01:19:20,396 --> 01:19:23,388
Someplace where I thought
I could win some money...

839
01:19:24,567 --> 01:19:27,331
...to buy a car, because I wanted...

840
01:19:28,371 --> 01:19:30,498
...to impress Mary Jane.

841
01:19:32,642 --> 01:19:34,667
It happened so fast.

842
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:39,680
I won the money, and the guy
wouldn't pay me. Then he got robbed.

843
01:19:41,184 --> 01:19:42,617
The thief...

844
01:19:43,619 --> 01:19:45,587
...was running towards me.

845
01:19:47,190 --> 01:19:49,988
I could've stopped him,
but I wanted...

846
01:19:50,727 --> 01:19:52,251
...revenge.

847
01:19:54,263 --> 01:19:55,787
I let him go.

848
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:00,635
I let him get away.

849
01:20:06,476 --> 01:20:08,273
He wanted a car.

850
01:20:08,444 --> 01:20:10,708
He tried to take Uncle Ben's.

851
01:20:11,981 --> 01:20:15,212
Uncle Ben said no...

852
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:18,880
...and then he shot him.

853
01:20:22,492 --> 01:20:26,155
Uncle Ben was killed that night...

854
01:20:27,797 --> 01:20:30,857
...for being the only one
who did the right thing.

855
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:35,332
And I...

856
01:20:38,775 --> 01:20:40,800
I held his hand...

857
01:20:41,411 --> 01:20:43,003
...when he died.

858
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:53,546
I've tried to tell you so many times.

859
01:21:50,146 --> 01:21:52,205
Just one more little chore.

860
01:21:59,856 --> 01:22:01,255
Where are you?

861
01:22:03,459 --> 01:22:07,293
- I'm leaving for the night, sir.
- Fine.

862
01:22:07,463 --> 01:22:10,193
Your father only obsessed
over his work.

863
01:22:10,366 --> 01:22:11,958
Good night, Bernard.

864
01:23:05,354 --> 01:23:06,582
Hello, Harry.

865
01:23:06,756 --> 01:23:08,986
Otto. What do you want?

866
01:23:09,592 --> 01:23:11,150
That precious tritium.

867
01:23:12,061 --> 01:23:13,722
But I need more of it this time.

868
01:23:15,464 --> 01:23:19,457
More tritium, are you crazy?
You'll destroy the city! You're a hack!

869
01:23:23,372 --> 01:23:25,397
Hey! Hey!

870
01:23:25,575 --> 01:23:28,567
Stop! Stop! All right!

871
01:23:29,011 --> 01:23:32,742
All right, all right, all right.
Put me down. We'll make a deal.

872
01:23:42,658 --> 01:23:45,855
Kill Spider-Man,
I'll give you all the tritium you need.

873
01:23:46,762 --> 01:23:50,596
On second thought,
bring him to me alive.

874
01:23:50,766 --> 01:23:52,028
How do I find him?

875
01:23:53,336 --> 01:23:54,997
- Peter Parker.
- Parker?

876
01:23:55,171 --> 01:23:57,435
He takes pictures of Spider-Man
for the <i>Bugle.</i>

877
01:23:57,607 --> 01:23:59,097
Make him tell you where he is.

878
01:24:04,914 --> 01:24:06,176
Have it ready.

879
01:24:10,052 --> 01:24:11,610
Don't hurt Peter!

880
01:24:24,834 --> 01:24:27,268
Somebody, help!

881
01:24:28,204 --> 01:24:29,796
Fire!

882
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:40,972
Alisa, the Chens can't find their
daughter. Have you seen her?

883
01:24:42,385 --> 01:24:44,979
Somebody call the fire department!
Help!

884
01:24:45,755 --> 01:24:48,053
- Help!
- Is anybody in that building?

885
01:24:48,224 --> 01:24:50,818
We think there's a kid
stuck on the second floor.

886
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,721
Hey, where you going?!

887
01:25:13,916 --> 01:25:15,315
I'm coming!

888
01:25:39,909 --> 01:25:42,707
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

889
01:25:42,878 --> 01:25:45,312
Come on. Come on.

890
01:26:45,574 --> 01:26:47,542
Mama.

891
01:26:59,555 --> 01:27:01,113
You got some guts, kid.

892
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:05,886
Some poor soul got trapped
on the fourth floor. Never made it out.

893
01:27:06,162 --> 01:27:07,629
Oh, man.

894
01:27:10,533 --> 01:27:13,991
All right, Billy, let's knock it down
and roll them up. Get on out of here.

895
01:27:14,170 --> 01:27:18,038
Let's pick it up! Let's get all this
equipment, let's go! Let's move it!

896
01:27:23,746 --> 01:27:26,738
Am I not supposed to have
what I want?

897
01:27:27,750 --> 01:27:29,217
What I need?

898
01:27:31,554 --> 01:27:33,988
What am I supposed to do?

899
01:27:40,663 --> 01:27:42,324
I shouldn't have without...

900
01:27:42,832 --> 01:27:44,094
...knocking.

901
01:27:48,671 --> 01:27:50,263
Come in.

902
01:27:53,342 --> 01:27:55,833
- Hi.
- Hi.

903
01:27:59,515 --> 01:28:02,109
Would you like a piece
of chocolate cake?

904
01:28:04,119 --> 01:28:05,552
Okay.

905
01:28:06,989 --> 01:28:09,048
And a glass of milk?

906
01:28:11,794 --> 01:28:13,386
That would be nice.

907
01:28:15,497 --> 01:28:17,624
Okay.

908
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:39,651
Thank you.

909
01:28:44,426 --> 01:28:45,984
You got a message.

910
01:28:47,162 --> 01:28:48,629
It's your aunt.

911
01:28:48,797 --> 01:28:50,560
Thanks.

912
01:29:06,515 --> 01:29:07,846
What's going on?

913
01:29:08,017 --> 01:29:11,817
Oh, they gave me another few weeks,
but I decided the hell with it.

914
01:29:11,987 --> 01:29:15,650
I'm moving on.
I found a small apartment.

915
01:29:15,891 --> 01:29:17,290
Why didn't you tell me?

916
01:29:17,459 --> 01:29:20,758
I'm quite able
to take care of things myself.

917
01:29:20,930 --> 01:29:24,331
And Henry Jackson across
the street is giving me a hand...

918
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:25,990
...and I'm giving him $5.

919
01:29:26,168 --> 01:29:27,760
That's Henry Jackson?

920
01:29:28,437 --> 01:29:30,530
Yes. It's funny what happens
in two years.

921
01:29:30,839 --> 01:29:34,275
Nine years old, has great ambitions.

922
01:29:35,945 --> 01:29:39,210
Listen, about my last visit...

923
01:29:39,381 --> 01:29:41,747
Pish-posh, we needn't talk about it.

924
01:29:41,917 --> 01:29:46,479
It's water over the dam or under
the bridge or wherever you like it.

925
01:29:49,959 --> 01:29:53,759
But you made a brave move
in telling me the truth.

926
01:29:53,996 --> 01:29:55,861
And I'm proud of you.

927
01:29:56,932 --> 01:29:59,332
And I thank you, and I...

928
01:30:00,602 --> 01:30:02,934
I love you, Peter.

929
01:30:04,173 --> 01:30:06,698
So very, very much.

930
01:30:26,161 --> 01:30:29,153
Hey. Where are all my comic books?

931
01:30:29,331 --> 01:30:32,198
Those dreadful things?
I gave those away.

932
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:38,535
- I put the pans in the box, Mrs. Parker.
- Thank you, Henry.

933
01:30:38,707 --> 01:30:40,265
- Hi, Peter.
- Hey, Henry.

934
01:30:40,442 --> 01:30:41,773
You're getting tall.

935
01:30:41,944 --> 01:30:46,040
Henry, why don't you put those
cookbooks in with the mixer.

936
01:30:46,215 --> 01:30:49,241
Okay. You take
Spider-Man's pictures, right?

937
01:30:50,219 --> 01:30:51,516
I used to.

938
01:30:51,687 --> 01:30:52,915
Where is he?

939
01:30:53,088 --> 01:30:57,354
Henry and I agree. We don't see
his picture in the paper anymore.

940
01:30:59,328 --> 01:31:00,852
He...

941
01:31:02,898 --> 01:31:05,389
...quit.
- Why?

942
01:31:06,268 --> 01:31:08,168
Wanted to try other things.

943
01:31:08,337 --> 01:31:09,929
He'll be back, right?

944
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:12,502
I don't know.

945
01:31:13,942 --> 01:31:16,934
You'll never guess
who he wants to be.

946
01:31:17,346 --> 01:31:19,109
Spider-Man.

947
01:31:19,281 --> 01:31:23,183
- Why?
- He knows a hero when he sees one.

948
01:31:23,352 --> 01:31:27,083
Too few characters out there,
flying around like that...

949
01:31:27,256 --> 01:31:29,315
...saving old girls like me.

950
01:31:29,491 --> 01:31:33,257
And Lord knows,
kids like Henry need a hero.

951
01:31:33,429 --> 01:31:36,296
Courageous, self-sacrificing people...

952
01:31:36,465 --> 01:31:38,797
...setting examples for all of us.

953
01:31:39,268 --> 01:31:41,668
Everybody loves a hero.

954
01:31:41,970 --> 01:31:45,406
People line up for them.
Cheer them. Scream their names.

955
01:31:45,574 --> 01:31:49,738
And years later, they'll tell how
they stood in the rain for hours...

956
01:31:49,912 --> 01:31:51,607
...just to get a glimpse of the one...

957
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:55,238
...who taught them to hold on
a second longer.

958
01:31:56,585 --> 01:31:59,816
I believe there's a hero in all of us...

959
01:32:00,589 --> 01:32:02,420
...that keeps us honest...

960
01:32:03,092 --> 01:32:04,753
...gives us strength...

961
01:32:05,094 --> 01:32:06,959
...makes us noble...

962
01:32:08,063 --> 01:32:11,590
...and finally allows us to die
with pride.

963
01:32:12,768 --> 01:32:16,898
Even though sometimes
we have to be steady...

964
01:32:17,072 --> 01:32:19,836
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

965
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:23,510
Even our dreams.

966
01:32:25,414 --> 01:32:28,144
Spider-Man did that for Henry...

967
01:32:28,317 --> 01:32:30,751
...and he wonders where he's gone.

968
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,820
He needs him.

969
01:32:38,193 --> 01:32:42,926
Do you think you could lift that desk
and put it into the garage for me?

970
01:32:43,365 --> 01:32:45,560
But don't strain yourself.

971
01:32:45,734 --> 01:32:47,361
Okay.

972
01:33:06,088 --> 01:33:08,318
Strong focus on what I want.

973
01:33:38,353 --> 01:33:39,945
I'm back!

974
01:33:40,122 --> 01:33:41,453
I'm back!

975
01:33:59,074 --> 01:34:00,473
My back.

976
01:34:01,410 --> 01:34:02,775
My back.

977
01:34:26,935 --> 01:34:31,269
Honey, you sure you don't want to
invite your friend, the photographer?

978
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,068
Peter Parker?

979
01:34:35,244 --> 01:34:36,472
Positive.

980
01:34:36,778 --> 01:34:37,938
Thought he was your pal.

981
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:40,612
- Peter Parker?
- Yeah.

982
01:34:41,516 --> 01:34:44,110
He's just a great big jerk.

983
01:34:44,453 --> 01:34:46,250
The world's full of great big jerks.

984
01:34:47,756 --> 01:34:49,519
You're adorable.

985
01:34:49,925 --> 01:34:51,517
It's just the uniform.

986
01:34:54,830 --> 01:34:56,923
Lean your head back for me.

987
01:34:57,232 --> 01:34:59,666
- Put my head back?
- Yeah, just do it.

988
01:35:01,703 --> 01:35:03,364
Just put my head back?

989
01:35:04,106 --> 01:35:05,698
Okay.

990
01:35:24,793 --> 01:35:26,283
Wow.

991
01:35:27,062 --> 01:35:28,825
I'm back on the moon.

992
01:35:33,468 --> 01:35:34,958
You up there with me?

993
01:35:55,757 --> 01:35:57,918
- Hiya.
- Surprised?

994
01:35:58,093 --> 01:35:59,583
Very.

995
01:35:59,761 --> 01:36:01,319
Thanks for coming.

996
01:36:01,663 --> 01:36:03,597
Everything okay?

997
01:36:04,599 --> 01:36:06,328
You might say so.

998
01:36:07,669 --> 01:36:11,435
This is funny.
I'm not sure how to begin.

999
01:36:13,875 --> 01:36:16,537
You know how our minds
play tricks on us.

1000
01:36:16,945 --> 01:36:20,847
- Tell me about it.
- Well, mine did a real number on me.

1001
01:36:22,451 --> 01:36:26,114
Some part of me heard what you
had to say after the show that night...

1002
01:36:26,288 --> 01:36:29,883
...that you were different.
But I didn't want to listen.

1003
01:36:30,726 --> 01:36:32,717
I was afraid to trust you.

1004
01:36:34,396 --> 01:36:37,422
But I've been thinking about it...

1005
01:36:37,599 --> 01:36:41,262
Listen, there's more for me to say.

1006
01:36:44,940 --> 01:36:49,138
I maybe rushed into things.
I thought...

1007
01:36:49,311 --> 01:36:51,939
Wait a minute.
What are you saying?

1008
01:36:52,647 --> 01:36:54,444
I'm saying...

1009
01:37:00,622 --> 01:37:03,614
I thought I could be there for you,
Mary Jane...

1010
01:37:04,126 --> 01:37:05,616
...but I can't.

1011
01:37:09,064 --> 01:37:12,295
My mind was playing tricks too.

1012
01:37:17,005 --> 01:37:19,599
Do you love me, or not?

1013
01:37:26,648 --> 01:37:28,275
I...

1014
01:37:31,586 --> 01:37:32,814
...don't.

1015
01:37:37,659 --> 01:37:39,593
You don't.

1016
01:37:49,137 --> 01:37:50,365
Kiss me.

1017
01:37:52,574 --> 01:37:54,064
Kiss you?

1018
01:37:54,242 --> 01:37:56,142
I need to know something.

1019
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:00,272
Just one kiss.

1020
01:38:47,629 --> 01:38:49,563
What's happening?

1021
01:38:59,808 --> 01:39:01,435
Peter Parker...

1022
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:04,107
...and the girlfriend.

1023
01:39:04,412 --> 01:39:06,243
What do you want?

1024
01:39:09,084 --> 01:39:11,245
I want you to find your friend
Spider-Man.

1025
01:39:11,419 --> 01:39:14,081
Tell him to meet me
at the Westside Tower at 3:00.

1026
01:39:14,256 --> 01:39:16,417
I don't know where he is.

1027
01:39:17,959 --> 01:39:19,517
Find him.

1028
01:39:21,796 --> 01:39:24,629
Or I'll peel the flesh off her bones.

1029
01:39:24,799 --> 01:39:26,790
If you lay one finger on her...

1030
01:39:26,968 --> 01:39:28,299
You'll do what?

1031
01:40:42,043 --> 01:40:45,774
Still no word on the whereabouts
of your son's fiancée.

1032
01:40:45,947 --> 01:40:47,539
Sorry, Jonah.

1033
01:40:48,617 --> 01:40:50,107
It's all my fault.

1034
01:40:51,886 --> 01:40:54,218
I drove Spider-Man away.

1035
01:40:54,489 --> 01:40:57,652
He was the only one who could've
stopped Octavius.

1036
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:00,388
Yes.

1037
01:41:02,030 --> 01:41:05,363
Spider-Man was a hero.

1038
01:41:06,568 --> 01:41:08,536
I just couldn't see it.

1039
01:41:10,138 --> 01:41:11,571
He was a...

1040
01:41:11,740 --> 01:41:14,470
A thief! A criminal!

1041
01:41:15,977 --> 01:41:18,275
He stole my suit!
He's a menace to the entire city!

1042
01:41:18,446 --> 01:41:21,472
I want that wall-crawling
arachnid prosecuted!

1043
01:41:21,650 --> 01:41:23,811
I want him strung up by his web!

1044
01:41:25,253 --> 01:41:27,915
I want Spider-Man!

1045
01:41:56,384 --> 01:41:57,749
Where is she?

1046
01:41:57,919 --> 01:42:00,513
Oh, she'll be just fine. Let's talk.

1047
01:42:51,773 --> 01:42:52,967
What the hell?

1048
01:45:45,079 --> 01:45:47,138
You have a train to catch.

1049
01:45:49,717 --> 01:45:51,548
Help!

1050
01:45:51,719 --> 01:45:56,088
Help! Help! I can't stop it!
The brakes are gone!

1051
01:46:14,842 --> 01:46:17,402
- It's Spider-Man.
- Oh, my God, this is it!

1052
01:46:17,578 --> 01:46:18,977
Tell everyone to hang on!

1053
01:46:19,147 --> 01:46:21,012
Brace yourselves!

1054
01:46:42,203 --> 01:46:44,535
Any more bright ideas?

1055
01:46:44,839 --> 01:46:47,239
I got a few, yeah!

1056
01:47:08,563 --> 01:47:10,394
Whoa, watch out!

1057
01:47:41,029 --> 01:47:42,291
We're slowing down.

1058
01:48:46,294 --> 01:48:48,262
Nice and easy, we'll go down.

1059
01:48:49,263 --> 01:48:50,753
Slower. Gently.

1060
01:48:56,003 --> 01:48:57,334
Is he alive?

1061
01:49:01,008 --> 01:49:02,339
He's...

1062
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:04,102
...just a kid.

1063
01:49:05,279 --> 01:49:07,110
No older than my son.

1064
01:49:26,467 --> 01:49:28,264
It's all right.

1065
01:49:32,673 --> 01:49:34,504
We found something.

1066
01:49:43,784 --> 01:49:45,945
We won't tell nobody.

1067
01:49:59,433 --> 01:50:02,129
It's good to have you back,
Spider-Man.

1068
01:50:21,956 --> 01:50:23,787
He's mine!

1069
01:50:24,592 --> 01:50:27,322
You want to get to him,
you got to go through me.

1070
01:50:27,662 --> 01:50:28,993
And me.

1071
01:50:29,597 --> 01:50:30,962
Me too.

1072
01:50:35,903 --> 01:50:37,461
Very well.

1073
01:51:06,467 --> 01:51:08,435
Where do you want him?

1074
01:51:16,244 --> 01:51:17,734
And the tritium?

1075
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:33,727
Yes.

1076
01:52:03,758 --> 01:52:06,886
If only I could cause you the pain
that you've caused me.

1077
01:52:09,563 --> 01:52:12,054
First we'll see who's behind the mask.

1078
01:52:12,233 --> 01:52:14,701
I can look into your eyes as you die.

1079
01:52:17,471 --> 01:52:18,995
Pete.

1080
01:52:19,373 --> 01:52:21,068
No.

1081
01:52:21,676 --> 01:52:23,075
It can't be.

1082
01:52:29,650 --> 01:52:30,947
Harry.

1083
01:52:32,486 --> 01:52:35,922
Where is she?
Where is he keeping her?

1084
01:52:37,258 --> 01:52:41,217
- He's got M.J.
- No. All he wanted was the tritium.

1085
01:52:41,996 --> 01:52:43,258
Tritium?

1086
01:52:45,266 --> 01:52:47,257
He's making the machine again.

1087
01:52:48,102 --> 01:52:52,334
When that happens, she'll die,
along with half of New York.

1088
01:52:52,506 --> 01:52:55,270
- Now, where is he?
- Peter...

1089
01:52:56,444 --> 01:52:58,275
...you killed my father.

1090
01:53:03,451 --> 01:53:07,547
There are bigger things
happening here than me and you.

1091
01:53:08,289 --> 01:53:11,053
Harry, please, I've got to stop him.

1092
01:53:21,669 --> 01:53:23,364
Hey!

1093
01:53:24,438 --> 01:53:26,099
Hey!

1094
01:53:27,508 --> 01:53:29,271
I'm talking to you!

1095
01:53:29,610 --> 01:53:33,102
You got what you needed for your little
science project, now let me go.

1096
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:35,145
I can't let you go,
you'd bring the police.

1097
01:53:35,316 --> 01:53:37,876
Not that anybody could stop me
now that Spider-Man's dead.

1098
01:53:38,853 --> 01:53:40,286
He's not dead.

1099
01:53:40,554 --> 01:53:43,182
- I don't believe you.
- Believe it.

1100
01:54:00,941 --> 01:54:02,272
Surprise.

1101
01:54:06,714 --> 01:54:08,341
As soon as you get free...

1102
01:54:10,518 --> 01:54:14,477
I should have known Osborn
wouldn't have the spine to finish you!

1103
01:54:14,655 --> 01:54:17,749
Shut it down, Ock. You're going
to hurt a lot more people this time.

1104
01:54:17,925 --> 01:54:20,257
Well, that's a risk
we're willing to take.

1105
01:54:21,395 --> 01:54:23,260
Well, I'm not.

1106
01:54:55,796 --> 01:54:57,024
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1107
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:14,208
Run!

1108
01:55:38,772 --> 01:55:41,104
Let's see you scurry out of this.

1109
01:56:04,965 --> 01:56:07,195
Now what?

1110
01:56:37,298 --> 01:56:39,425
Dr. Octavius.

1111
01:56:42,603 --> 01:56:43,831
We have to shut it down.

1112
01:56:44,705 --> 01:56:46,263
Please tell me how.

1113
01:56:46,440 --> 01:56:47,873
Peter Parker?

1114
01:56:51,445 --> 01:56:53,470
"Brilliant but lazy."

1115
01:56:53,814 --> 01:56:55,213
Look at what's happening.

1116
01:56:56,216 --> 01:56:58,150
We must destroy it.

1117
01:57:03,724 --> 01:57:05,316
I can't destroy it.

1118
01:57:10,598 --> 01:57:11,929
I won't.

1119
01:57:17,504 --> 01:57:19,631
You once spoke to me
about intelligence.

1120
01:57:21,575 --> 01:57:25,272
That it was a gift to be used
for the good of mankind.

1121
01:57:26,981 --> 01:57:28,380
A privilege.

1122
01:57:29,049 --> 01:57:32,109
These things have turned you
into something you're not.

1123
01:57:33,153 --> 01:57:35,018
Don't listen to them.

1124
01:57:40,894 --> 01:57:42,452
It was my dream.

1125
01:57:42,630 --> 01:57:47,124
Sometimes, to do what's right,
we have to be steady...

1126
01:57:47,301 --> 01:57:49,792
...and give up the thing
we want the most.

1127
01:57:50,638 --> 01:57:52,299
Even our dreams.

1128
01:57:58,312 --> 01:57:59,939
You're right.

1129
01:58:07,354 --> 01:58:09,219
He's right.

1130
01:58:10,958 --> 01:58:12,550
Listen.

1131
01:58:14,762 --> 01:58:17,026
Listen to me now.

1132
01:58:19,933 --> 01:58:22,231
Listen to me now.

1133
01:58:25,973 --> 01:58:28,942
Now, tell me how to stop it.

1134
01:58:30,044 --> 01:58:31,705
It can't be stopped.

1135
01:58:33,113 --> 01:58:35,206
It's self-sustaining now.

1136
01:58:35,382 --> 01:58:37,441
- Think!
- Unless...

1137
01:58:39,019 --> 01:58:40,748
The river.

1138
01:58:42,122 --> 01:58:43,714
Drown it.

1139
01:58:45,693 --> 01:58:47,024
I'll do it.

1140
01:59:32,339 --> 01:59:35,069
No!

1141
01:59:47,087 --> 01:59:48,679
Hi.

1142
01:59:49,356 --> 01:59:50,983
Hi.

1143
01:59:51,792 --> 01:59:53,157
This is really heavy.

1144
02:00:17,818 --> 02:00:19,786
M.J.

1145
02:00:20,654 --> 02:00:22,451
In case we die...

1146
02:00:22,623 --> 02:00:24,181
You do love me.

1147
02:00:24,758 --> 02:00:25,986
I do.

1148
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:29,019
Even though you said you didn't.

1149
02:00:31,965 --> 02:00:34,433
I will not die a monster.

1150
02:01:39,733 --> 02:01:41,792
I think I always knew...

1151
02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:44,497
...all this time...

1152
02:01:45,672 --> 02:01:47,469
...who you really were.

1153
02:01:48,075 --> 02:01:50,635
Then you know
why we can't be together.

1154
02:01:51,845 --> 02:01:54,814
Spider-Man will always have enemies.

1155
02:01:56,650 --> 02:01:59,346
I can't let you take that risk.

1156
02:02:04,057 --> 02:02:05,422
I will...

1157
02:02:07,094 --> 02:02:09,358
...always be Spider-Man.

1158
02:02:12,132 --> 02:02:14,600
You and I can never be.

1159
02:03:02,883 --> 02:03:04,874
Mary Jane!

1160
02:04:07,981 --> 02:04:09,642
Hello?

1161
02:04:25,665 --> 02:04:26,996
Who's that?

1162
02:04:27,167 --> 02:04:29,101
Son.

1163
02:04:30,203 --> 02:04:31,727
I'm here.

1164
02:04:32,873 --> 02:04:34,500
Dad?

1165
02:04:35,575 --> 02:04:37,770
- I thought you were...
- No.

1166
02:04:38,278 --> 02:04:40,371
I'm alive in you, Harry.

1167
02:04:40,547 --> 02:04:41,912
Now it's your turn.

1168
02:04:43,483 --> 02:04:46,145
You swore to make Spider-Man pay.

1169
02:04:46,520 --> 02:04:48,181
Now make him pay.

1170
02:04:48,488 --> 02:04:50,149
But Pete's my best friend.

1171
02:04:50,323 --> 02:04:51,915
And I'm your father.

1172
02:04:52,893 --> 02:04:54,326
You're weak.

1173
02:04:55,328 --> 02:04:59,662
You were always weak. You'll always
be weak until you take control.

1174
02:05:00,734 --> 02:05:03,567
Now you know the truth about Peter.

1175
02:05:04,504 --> 02:05:05,994
Be strong, Harry.

1176
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:08,439
Avenge me.

1177
02:05:11,244 --> 02:05:13,269
- Avenge me!
- No!

1178
02:07:37,958 --> 02:07:39,357
Call Deborah.

1179
02:07:39,526 --> 02:07:41,357
The caterer?

1180
02:07:42,362 --> 02:07:44,455
Tell her not to open the caviar.

1181
02:08:25,839 --> 02:08:28,000
Had to do what I had to do.

1182
02:08:29,676 --> 02:08:31,007
Mary Jane.

1183
02:08:32,178 --> 02:08:33,440
Peter.

1184
02:08:34,681 --> 02:08:37,115
I can't survive without you.

1185
02:08:47,127 --> 02:08:48,958
You shouldn't be here.

1186
02:08:50,063 --> 02:08:53,123
I know you think we can't be together.

1187
02:08:54,200 --> 02:08:57,897
But can't you respect me enough
to let me make my own decision?

1188
02:08:59,172 --> 02:09:00,901
I know there'll be risks.

1189
02:09:01,841 --> 02:09:04,401
But I want to face them with you.

1190
02:09:05,578 --> 02:09:08,945
It's wrong that
we should only be half-alive...

1191
02:09:09,115 --> 02:09:10,878
...half of ourselves.

1192
02:09:13,353 --> 02:09:14,945
I love you.

1193
02:09:17,223 --> 02:09:20,192
So here I am,
standing in your doorway.

1194
02:09:21,928 --> 02:09:25,022
I've always been
standing in your doorway.

1195
02:09:32,072 --> 02:09:35,599
Isn't it about time somebody
saved your life?

1196
02:09:41,548 --> 02:09:43,379
Well, say something.

1197
02:09:45,885 --> 02:09:48,376
Thank you, Mary Jane Watson.

1198
02:10:04,571 --> 02:10:06,334
Go get them, tiger.
