1
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:24,600
Peter.

2
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:30,481
You could not watch
even one hour with me?

3
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,550
Master, what has happened to you?

4
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,177
Should I call the others, Lord?

5
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:39,651
No, John.
I don't want them to see me like this.

6
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,553
Are you in danger?
Should we flee, Master?

7
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:46,063
Stay here. Watch...

8
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,693
...pray.

9
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,910
What is wrong with him?

10
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,845
He seems afraid.

11
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,781
He had spoken about danger
while we ate...

12
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,294
He mentioned betrayal and...

13
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:38,375
Thirty.

14
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:40,816
Thirty, Judas.

15
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:45,724
That was the agreement
between me... and you?

16
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,451
Yes.

17
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:34,136
Where?

18
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,705
Where is he?

19
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:14,737
Hear me, Father.

20
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:21,819
Rise up, defend me.

21
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,560
Save me from the traps they set for me.

22
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:55,788
Do you really believe...

23
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:00,455
...that one man can bear...

24
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,926
...the full burden of sin?

25
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:05,894
Shelter me, O Lord.

26
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,763
I trust in You.

27
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,338
In You I take refuge.

28
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:24,673
No one man can carry this burden...

29
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,576
...I tell you.

30
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,922
It is far too heavy.

31
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:35,326
Saving their souls is too costly.

32
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:39,696
No one. Ever.

33
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:42,229
No.

34
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:44,895
Never.

35
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,407
Father, you can do all things.

36
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:59,041
If it is possible, let this chalice
pass from me...

37
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,782
But let Your will be done...

38
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,561
...not mine.

39
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,015
Who is your father?

40
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:47,696
Who are you?

41
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,317
Who are you looking for?

42
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,127
We're looking for Jesus of Nazareth.

43
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,324
I am he.

44
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:32,524
Hail, Rabbi!

45
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,110
Judas...

46
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:52,950
...you betray the Son of Man
with a kiss?

47
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,332
Peter!

48
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:58,033
Put it down!

49
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:04,004
Those who live by the sword
shall die by the sword.

50
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:14,389
Put it down.

51
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:51,119
Malchus! Get up!

52
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,427
We've got him. Let's go!

53
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,749
What, Mary? What is it?

54
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,327
Listen...

55
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:29,890
"Why is this night different
from every other night?"

56
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:37,238
"Because once we were slaves...

57
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:40,237
"...and we are slaves no longer..."

58
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:51,913
They've seized him!

59
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:26,316
Everyone you can, hear?
To the courtyard of the High Priest.

60
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,685
Quick! Go!

61
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,973
Halt! Not so fast.

62
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,571
This is not your party,
you toothless vermin.

63
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,817
Peter...

64
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:27,995
Hey! What's going on here?

65
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:29,869
In there! Stop them!

66
00:18:30,475 --> 00:18:31,999
They've arrested him!

67
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:35,275
In secret! In the night!

68
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,945
To hide their crime from you!

69
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,409
Stop them!

70
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:42,252
What are you yelling about, woman?

71
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,950
Who have they arrested?

72
00:18:45,224 --> 00:18:46,418
Jesus.

73
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,190
Jesus of Nazareth!

74
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,690
Shut up!

75
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,169
She's crazy.

76
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:04,136
A criminal.
Brought in for questioning, that's all.

77
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,310
Broke the temple laws.

78
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,255
I see.

79
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:23,159
Better go tell him
there's more trouble brewing.

80
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:24,662
Tell who?

81
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:27,689
Abenader, you idiot.

82
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,831
Get going!

83
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:32,767
Go!

84
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:17,308
Jesus...

85
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:35,992
Are you hungry?

86
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,437
Yes, I am.

87
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,672
This is certainly a tall table!

88
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:53,985
Who is it for?

89
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,816
A rich man.

90
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,449
Does he like to eat standing up?

91
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,822
No. He prefers to eat like... so.

92
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:11,235
Tall table, tall chairs!

93
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,428
Well, I haven't made them yet.

94
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:32,589
This will never catch on!

95
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,183
Oh, no you don't!

96
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,927
Take off that dirty apron
before you come in.

97
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,126
And wash your hands.

98
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:13,595
It has begun, Lord.

99
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,331
So be it.

100
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,702
Sir, there's trouble at...

101
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:54,203
What, in the middle of the night,
Abenader?

102
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:55,532
I'm sorry.

103
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:56,606
What's the problem?

104
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:59,103
Trouble within the walls.

105
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,674
Caiphas had some prophet arrested.

106
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:03,675
Who?

107
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,510
Some Galilean.

108
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:09,546
The Pharisees apparently hate the man.

109
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:12,418
A Galilean? Who are you talking about?

110
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,422
Who is this beggar you bring to us...

111
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:20,230
...chained up like a condemned man?

112
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,357
He's Jesus, the Nazarene troublemaker.

113
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:28,200
You're Jesus of Nazareth?

114
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:32,800
They say you're a king.

115
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:34,869
Where is this kingdom of yours?

116
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:38,382
What line of kings do you descend from?

117
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,981
Speak up!

118
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:45,011
You're just the son
of some obscure carpenter, no?

119
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,256
Some say you're Elijah.

120
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,824
But he was carried off to heaven
in a chariot!

121
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,931
Why don't you say something?

122
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:02,197
You've been brought here
as a blasphemer!

123
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,837
What do you say to that?

124
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:08,109
Defend yourself.

125
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,447
I have spoken openly to everyone.

126
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,185
I've taught...

127
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:23,860
...in the temple where we all gather.

128
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,427
Ask those
who have heard what I have to say.

129
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,724
Is that how you address the high priest?

130
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,934
With arrogance?

131
00:24:48,353 --> 00:24:50,218
If I have spoken evil...

132
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:53,322
...tell me what evil I have said.

133
00:24:54,793 --> 00:24:58,456
But if not, why do you hit me?

134
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,861
Yes, we'll listen to those
who heard your blasphemies.

135
00:25:05,036 --> 00:25:06,003
Good!

136
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:10,672
Let's hear them.

137
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,244
He cures the sick by magic!

138
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:17,643
With the help of devils!

139
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,477
I've seen it.

140
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:26,546
He casts out devils,
with the help of devils.

141
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:36,227
He calls himself the king of the Jews!

142
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,429
No, he calls himself the son of God!

143
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,034
He said
he would destroy the temple...

144
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:49,004
...and rebuild it in three days!

145
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,715
Worse!

146
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:56,285
He claims he's the bread of life!

147
00:25:56,788 --> 00:26:01,521
And if we don't eat his flesh
or drink his blood...

148
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:04,453
...we won't inherit eternal life.

149
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,159
Silence!

150
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:11,827
You're all under this man's spell.

151
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:16,602
Either offer proof of his wrongdoing...

152
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,007
...or be quiet!

153
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:25,710
This entire proceeding is an outrage.

154
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:30,753
All I've heard from these witnesses
is mindless contradiction!

155
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,929
Who called this meeting anyway?

156
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,234
And at this hour of the night?

157
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:51,168
Where are the other members
of the council?

158
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:52,904
Get him out of here!

159
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,438
Get out!

160
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:01,780
A travesty!
That's what this is, a beastly travesty!

161
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,462
Haven't you anything to say?

162
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,892
No answer to these accusations?

163
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:21,695
I ask you now...

164
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,699
...Jesus of Nazareth...

165
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:30,142
Tell us, are you the Messiah?

166
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,718
The son of the living God?

167
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,296
I AM...

168
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:53,462
...and you will see the Son of Man
seated at the right hand of power...

169
00:27:54,873 --> 00:27:57,967
...and coming on the clouds of heaven.

170
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:04,574
Blasphemy!

171
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:08,652
You heard him.

172
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,080
There's no need for witnesses!

173
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:18,351
Your verdict. What is your verdict?

174
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,591
Death!

175
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:18,651
Haven't I seen you
in the company of the Galilean?

176
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:21,523
Yes! You're one of his disciples!

177
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:24,218
I recognize you!

178
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:27,598
Quiet! I've never met the man.
I don't know him.

179
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:31,233
You are Peter!
One of the disciples of Jesus.

180
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:39,168
I don't know the man! You are wrong!

181
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:41,371
Stop! Stop!

182
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,043
I've seen you before!

183
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:45,779
Stop him! He's one of them!

184
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,580
You're wrong, damn you!

185
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,357
I swear I don't know the man.

186
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,559
I've never seen him before.

187
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:09,139
Wherever you go, Lord...

188
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:13,538
...I will follow.

189
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:20,674
To prison, even to death.

190
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:27,190
Amen, I say to you...

191
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,763
...before the cock crows...

192
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,335
...three times you will deny me.

193
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,858
Peter?

194
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,236
No, no... I am unworthy!

195
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:26,840
I have denied him, Mother!

196
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:31,410
Denied him three times.

197
00:31:43,835 --> 00:31:47,703
Let's go! You take care of it.

198
00:31:51,542 --> 00:31:54,739
Let him pass. He's harmless.

199
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,545
Release him!

200
00:32:00,284 --> 00:32:02,184
Take back the silver.

201
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,053
Here!

202
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:10,019
I've sinned, betrayed innocent blood.

203
00:32:12,697 --> 00:32:17,066
Take back your silver. I don't want it!

204
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:22,562
If you think you've betrayed innocent
blood, that's your affair.

205
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,776
Take your money and go.

206
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,601
Now go!

207
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,268
What's wrong? Are you all right?

208
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:00,134
Look at his mouth.
Hey, can we look at it?

209
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:02,672
You need help? Can we help?

210
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,409
He's bleeding! Look! Blood!

211
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:11,414
Leave me alone...

212
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,583
...you little satans!

213
00:33:14,725 --> 00:33:17,990
Aha! Cursing! Are you cursed?

214
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:19,923
He's cursed!

215
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:22,165
Yes, a curse! It's inside him, look!

216
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:37,805
Watch out, it's like burning oil
from his bones!

217
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:46,353
Get away from me! Leave me alone!

218
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:08,082
Don't condemn this Galilean.

219
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,784
He's holy.

220
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,615
You will only bring trouble on yourself.

221
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,949
Do you want to know my idea of trouble,
Claudia?

222
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:20,592
This stinking outpost,
that filthy rabble out there.

223
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:07,309
Do you always punish your prisoners
before they're judged?

224
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,440
Governor...

225
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,306
What accusations do you bring
against this man?

226
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,379
Well...

227
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,055
If he weren't a malefactor, we wouldn't
have brought him before you.

228
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,048
That's not what I asked.

229
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,991
Why don't you judge him
according to your own laws?

230
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:28,059
Consul, you know it's unlawful for us...

231
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:31,830
...to condemn any man to death.

232
00:39:32,636 --> 00:39:33,660
To death?

233
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,504
What has this man done
to merit such a penalty?

234
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,538
He has violated our Sabbath, Consul.

235
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:43,170
Go on...

236
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,111
He has seduced the people...

237
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:48,919
...taught foul, disgusting doctrines.

238
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:54,421
Isn't he the prophet you welcomed into
Jerusalem only five days ago?

239
00:39:55,159 --> 00:39:56,888
And now you want him dead?

240
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,619
Can any of you explain
this madness to me?

241
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,807
Your Excellency, please...

242
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:17,739
So far the high priest hasn't told you
this man's greatest crime.

243
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:22,378
He has become the leader
of a large and dangerous sect...

244
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,551
...who hail him as the Son of David!

245
00:40:27,024 --> 00:40:31,154
He claims that he is the Messiah...

246
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,257
...the king promised to the Jews.

247
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:40,526
He has forbidden his followers to pay
tribute to the emperor, Consul!

248
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,012
Bring him here!

249
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,043
Go!

250
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,117
Drink.

251
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,569
Are you the king of the Jews?

252
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:50,700
Does this question come from you?

253
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:56,168
Or do you ask me this because others
have told you that is what I am?

254
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:00,941
Why would I ask you that?

255
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,209
Am I a Jew?

256
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:08,914
Your high priests, your own people
delivered you up to me.

257
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,254
They want me to have you executed.

258
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,790
Why? What have you done?

259
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,597
Are you a king?

260
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:25,471
My kingdom is not of this world.

261
00:42:25,909 --> 00:42:27,536
If it were...

262
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:32,612
...do you think my followers
would have let them hand me over?

263
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:35,483
Then you are a king?

264
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:40,716
That is why I was born.

265
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:44,423
To give testimony to the truth.

266
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:50,155
All men who hear the truth
hear my voice.

267
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,603
Truth!

268
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,170
What is truth?

269
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:30,195
I have questioned this prisoner,
and I find no cause in him.

270
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,676
This man is a Galilean, is he not?

271
00:43:43,987 --> 00:43:44,976
He is.

272
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,653
Then he is King Herod's subject.

273
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,284
Let Herod judge him.

274
00:43:50,627 --> 00:43:51,252
Governor...

275
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:52,620
Hand him over.

276
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,015
Jesus of Nazareth!

277
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:19,622
Where?

278
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,324
Where is he?

279
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,094
This...

280
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,073
...is Jesus of Nazareth?

281
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:47,349
Is it true that you restore sight
to the blind?

282
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,851
Raise men from the dead?

283
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:14,037
Where do you get your power?

284
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:25,144
Are you the one
whose birth was foretold?

285
00:45:31,862 --> 00:45:33,693
Answer me!

286
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:36,098
Are you a king?

287
00:45:41,271 --> 00:45:42,898
How about me?

288
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:47,638
Will you work a little miracle for me?

289
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:07,623
Take this stupid fool out of my sight.

290
00:46:08,131 --> 00:46:11,157
He's not guilty of a crime,
he's just crazy.

291
00:46:13,136 --> 00:46:16,401
Give him a fool's homage...

292
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,827
What is truth, Claudia?

293
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:46,265
Do you hear it,
recognize it when it is spoken?

294
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:49,232
Yes, I do.

295
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:52,669
Don't you?

296
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,603
How?

297
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,279
Can you tell me?

298
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:11,358
If you will not hear the truth,
no one can tell you.

299
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,926
Truth...

300
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:19,597
Do you want to know what my truth is,
Claudia?

301
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:25,674
I've been putting down rebellions in
this rotten outpost for eleven years.

302
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,444
If I don't condemn this man...

303
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:32,612
...I know Caiphas will start a rebellion.

304
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:36,853
If I do condemn him,
then his followers may.

305
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:39,651
Either way, there will be bloodshed.

306
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,489
Caesar has warned me, Claudia.
Warned me twice.

307
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:48,057
He swore that the next time
the blood would be mine.

308
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:50,493
That is my truth!

309
00:47:55,405 --> 00:48:00,365
Herod refuses to condemn the man.
They're bringing him back here.

310
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,536
We're going to need reinforcements.

311
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,144
I don't want to cause an uprising.

312
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,652
There is already an uprising.

313
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:38,941
King Herod found no cause in this man.

314
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:43,948
Neither do I.

315
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,323
Men! Attend to the crowd!

316
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:07,541
Quiet!

317
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:11,538
Have you no respect
for our Roman procurator?

318
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:23,223
As you know, every year
I release a criminal back to you.

319
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:27,357
We are now holding
a notorious murderer...

320
00:49:28,432 --> 00:49:29,865
...Barabbas.

321
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,847
Which of the two men would you have me
release to you?

322
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,053
The murderer Barabbas?

323
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,222
Or Jesus, called the Messiah?

324
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:59,023
He is not the Messiah!
He is an imposter! A blasphemer!

325
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:02,028
Free Barabbas!

326
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:23,508
Again I ask you: Which of these two men
should I release to you?

327
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:26,385
Free Barabbas!

328
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:43,966
Free him.

329
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:21,544
What would you have me do
with Jesus the Nazarene?

330
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:24,443
Have him crucified!

331
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:41,221
No!

332
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:43,325
I will chastise him...

333
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,465
...but then I will set him free.

334
00:51:50,207 --> 00:51:52,971
See to it that the punishment
is severe, Abenader.

335
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:56,706
But don't let them kill the man.

336
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:20,588
My heart is ready, Father...

337
00:53:21,164 --> 00:53:23,132
...my heart is ready.

338
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:49,121
My son...

339
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,260
...when, where, how...

340
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,171
...will you choose to be delivered of this?

341
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:25,137
If the world hates you...

342
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:30,968
...remember that it has hated me first.

343
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:40,553
Remember also that no servant
is greater than his master.

344
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:47,088
If they persecuted me,
they will persecute you.

345
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:50,828
You must not be afraid.

346
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:54,363
The Helper will come...

347
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:59,871
...who reveals the truth about God...

348
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:05,643
...and who comes from the Father.

349
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:14,716
Stop!

350
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:20,829
Enough!
Your orders were to punish this man...

351
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:27,034
...not to scourge him to death!

352
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,770
Take him away.

353
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:39,044
Get going!

354
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:50,214
Get him out of here!

355
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,680
Your majesty...

356
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,915
Take care of it.

357
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:28,256
A beautiful rose bush.

358
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:35,391
Look at him... king of the worms!

359
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:38,659
Hail, wormy king!

360
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:43,432
A color fit for a king!

361
01:07:59,808 --> 01:08:01,833
We're here to pay our respects.

362
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,478
A leader for our brotherhood!

363
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,660
Behold the man.

364
01:09:01,036 --> 01:09:03,129
Crucify him!

365
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:16,682
Isn't this enough? Look at him!

366
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:18,681
Crucify him!

367
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:34,602
Shall I crucify your king?

368
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:39,238
We have no king but Caesar!

369
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,709
Speak to me.

370
01:09:43,912 --> 01:09:47,575
I have the power to crucify you,
or else to set you free.

371
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,822
You have no power over me...

372
01:09:56,525 --> 01:10:01,394
...except what is given you from above.

373
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:06,565
Therefore,
it is he who delivered me to you...

374
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:12,538
...who has the greater sin.

375
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:17,111
If you free him, Governor...

376
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:21,348
...you are no friend of Caesar's.

377
01:10:23,285 --> 01:10:25,344
You must crucify him!

378
01:11:56,540 --> 01:12:00,806
It is you who want to crucify him,
not I. Look you to it.

379
01:12:01,579 --> 01:12:04,377
I am innocent of this man's blood.

380
01:12:23,401 --> 01:12:24,425
Abenader...

381
01:12:30,141 --> 01:12:32,666
Do as they wish.

382
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:08,437
I am your servant, Father.

383
01:13:08,546 --> 01:13:11,174
Your servant,
and the son of Your handmaid.

384
01:13:12,116 --> 01:13:17,076
Why do you embrace your cross, fool?

385
01:13:21,158 --> 01:13:23,922
All right, your highness, let's move!

386
01:14:59,056 --> 01:15:01,524
Help me get near him.

387
01:15:04,562 --> 01:15:06,860
This way.

388
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:58,712
This way, Mother.

389
01:16:38,022 --> 01:16:39,580
Mother...

390
01:17:40,784 --> 01:17:42,217
Mother...

391
01:18:18,188 --> 01:18:20,088
I'm here...

392
01:18:23,594 --> 01:18:25,562
I'm here...

393
01:18:35,839 --> 01:18:40,299
See, mother, I make all things new.

394
01:19:10,908 --> 01:19:12,205
Who is that?

395
01:19:12,409 --> 01:19:13,137
Who?

396
01:19:15,546 --> 01:19:17,036
She's the Galilean's mother.

397
01:19:17,748 --> 01:19:18,840
Let's go.

398
01:19:21,418 --> 01:19:22,350
Come on!

399
01:20:33,290 --> 01:20:35,349
Don't fret, my daughter.

400
01:20:35,759 --> 01:20:37,954
Don't fret.

401
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:09,523
Are you blind?

402
01:21:10,527 --> 01:21:13,894
Can't you see, he can't go on?

403
01:21:18,001 --> 01:21:19,468
Help him!

404
01:21:38,722 --> 01:21:40,019
You!

405
01:21:40,557 --> 01:21:45,085
Yes, you! Get over here!

406
01:21:51,668 --> 01:21:52,657
What do you want from me?

407
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:56,433
This criminal can't carry his cross
by himself anymore.

408
01:21:56,707 --> 01:21:58,937
You will help him! Now get going!

409
01:22:00,310 --> 01:22:03,905
I can't do that. It's none of my business.
Get someone else!

410
01:22:04,515 --> 01:22:06,813
Help him! He is a holy man.

411
01:22:07,184 --> 01:22:08,981
Do as I tell you. Now move! Let's go!

412
01:22:13,690 --> 01:22:16,090
All right, but remember...

413
01:22:16,460 --> 01:22:20,191
...I'm an innocent man, forced to carry
the cross of a condemned man.

414
01:22:21,565 --> 01:22:24,033
Stay here. Wait for me.

415
01:24:19,983 --> 01:24:22,611
Permit me, my Lord.

416
01:24:52,616 --> 01:24:56,211
Who do you think you are?

417
01:24:56,586 --> 01:24:59,054
Get away from here.

418
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:02,114
Impossible people!

419
01:25:11,501 --> 01:25:13,628
Someone stop this!

420
01:25:29,152 --> 01:25:32,747
Stop! Stop!

421
01:25:40,163 --> 01:25:43,155
Leave him alone!

422
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:55,143
If you don't stop, I won't carry
that cross one more step.

423
01:25:55,946 --> 01:25:58,915
I don't care what you do to me!

424
01:26:04,087 --> 01:26:07,056
All right, all right, let's get moving.

425
01:26:07,591 --> 01:26:10,389
We don't have all day. Let's go!

426
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,627
Let's go...

427
01:26:19,436 --> 01:26:21,063
...Jew!

428
01:28:59,029 --> 01:29:00,621
Almost there.

429
01:29:07,237 --> 01:29:09,262
We're nearly there.

430
01:29:23,887 --> 01:29:25,855
Almost done.

431
01:29:36,433 --> 01:29:40,733
You have heard it said...

432
01:29:42,339 --> 01:29:45,672
...you shall love your neighbor
and hate your enemy.

433
01:29:47,243 --> 01:29:49,404
But I say to you...

434
01:29:50,513 --> 01:29:55,473
...Iove your enemies
and pray for those who persecute you...

435
01:29:58,254 --> 01:30:01,485
For if you love only those who love you...

436
01:30:05,061 --> 01:30:07,791
...what reward is there in that?

437
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,652
I am the good shepherd.

438
01:31:08,058 --> 01:31:10,583
I lay down my life for my sheep.

439
01:31:11,327 --> 01:31:14,353
No one takes my life from me...

440
01:31:15,131 --> 01:31:17,099
...but I lay it down of my own accord.

441
01:31:17,567 --> 01:31:19,694
I have power to lay it down...

442
01:31:20,270 --> 01:31:23,762
...and power to take it up again.

443
01:31:26,342 --> 01:31:28,242
This command is from my Father.

444
01:32:08,618 --> 01:32:13,112
Get away now, you're free to go.
Go on! Go on!

445
01:32:21,264 --> 01:32:24,961
You can get up now!

446
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:07,237
Get up, your majesty.

447
01:33:08,044 --> 01:33:10,205
Can't you get up?

448
01:33:11,614 --> 01:33:13,946
We haven't got all day.

449
01:33:23,092 --> 01:33:24,616
Come on, move! We're ready.

450
01:33:24,928 --> 01:33:26,759
Get up, your highness.

451
01:35:11,234 --> 01:35:12,758
You are my friends.

452
01:35:14,704 --> 01:35:19,664
There is no greater love than for a man
to lay down his life for his friends.

453
01:36:18,568 --> 01:36:21,093
I cannot be with you much longer,
my friends.

454
01:36:21,371 --> 01:36:27,003
You cannot go where I am going.

455
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:30,843
My commandment to you
after I am gone is this...

456
01:36:32,648 --> 01:36:34,275
Love one another.

457
01:36:35,218 --> 01:36:37,948
As I have loved you...

458
01:36:38,654 --> 01:36:42,784
...so love one another.

459
01:37:05,915 --> 01:37:08,543
You believe in me.

460
01:37:12,255 --> 01:37:14,883
You know that I am the Way...

461
01:37:15,758 --> 01:37:20,718
...the Truth, and the Life.

462
01:37:22,698 --> 01:37:27,226
And no one comes to the Father
but by me.

463
01:37:32,141 --> 01:37:34,268
Further out...

464
01:37:41,150 --> 01:37:44,608
Idiots! Let me show you how to do it.

465
01:37:44,987 --> 01:37:46,011
Like this!

466
01:38:04,574 --> 01:38:09,068
There! No, get in there.
Hold the hand open like this.

467
01:38:09,679 --> 01:38:12,204
Father, forgive them...

468
01:39:02,131 --> 01:39:03,655
Father...

469
01:39:04,467 --> 01:39:08,369
...Father my Father... my God...

470
01:39:12,141 --> 01:39:15,269
They don't know... they don't know...

471
01:39:19,181 --> 01:39:21,274
Stupid mongrels!

472
01:39:21,651 --> 01:39:25,382
Turn the wood over on its face, idiots!

473
01:40:53,576 --> 01:40:56,306
Take this and eat.

474
01:40:56,846 --> 01:41:01,249
This is my body
which is given up for you.

475
01:42:45,721 --> 01:42:48,019
Take this and drink.

476
01:42:50,392 --> 01:42:53,259
This is my blood of the new covenant...

477
01:42:54,396 --> 01:42:58,628
...which is given for you and for many,
for the forgiveness of sins.

478
01:42:59,101 --> 01:43:01,069
Do this in memory of me.

479
01:43:30,699 --> 01:43:35,659
If you are the son of God,
why don't you save yourself?

480
01:43:37,706 --> 01:43:39,674
Prove to us...

481
01:43:41,544 --> 01:43:44,604
...you are who you say you are.

482
01:44:02,965 --> 01:44:06,366
You said you could destroy the temple...

483
01:44:06,502 --> 01:44:08,868
...and rebuild it in three days...

484
01:44:09,772 --> 01:44:13,674
...and yet you cannot come down
from that cross.

485
01:44:13,876 --> 01:44:16,401
If he is the Messiah...

486
01:44:17,746 --> 01:44:22,183
...I say let him come down
from the cross...

487
01:44:23,452 --> 01:44:25,977
...so that we may see and believe.

488
01:44:35,531 --> 01:44:38,591
Father, forgive them...

489
01:44:41,003 --> 01:44:45,064
...they know not what they do.

490
01:44:49,812 --> 01:44:51,780
Listen...

491
01:44:53,148 --> 01:44:56,345
...he prays for you.

492
01:45:11,233 --> 01:45:13,861
We deserve this, Gesmas...

493
01:45:15,004 --> 01:45:16,995
...but he does not.

494
01:45:19,341 --> 01:45:20,865
I have sinned...

495
01:45:22,244 --> 01:45:26,078
...and my punishment is just.

496
01:45:27,216 --> 01:45:31,175
You would be justified in condemning me.

497
01:45:32,588 --> 01:45:37,491
I ask only that you remember me, Lord...

498
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:41,557
...when you enter your kingdom.

499
01:45:43,532 --> 01:45:45,329
Amen, I tell you...

500
01:45:48,537 --> 01:45:51,165
...on this day you shall be with me...

501
01:45:54,209 --> 01:45:55,836
...in paradise.

502
01:49:10,372 --> 01:49:12,237
I thirst.

503
01:49:47,476 --> 01:49:49,944
Flesh of my flesh...

504
01:49:52,447 --> 01:49:55,439
...heart of my heart...

505
01:49:57,186 --> 01:50:02,146
My son, let me die with you.

506
01:50:05,727 --> 01:50:07,422
Woman...

507
01:50:08,730 --> 01:50:12,166
...behold your son.

508
01:50:19,408 --> 01:50:21,638
Son, behold...

509
01:50:27,115 --> 01:50:29,049
...your mother.

510
01:50:39,127 --> 01:50:42,096
There is no one left.

511
01:50:43,265 --> 01:50:48,134
No one, Jesus!

512
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:01,838
My God...

513
01:51:14,563 --> 01:51:18,522
...why have you forsaken me?

514
01:51:37,219 --> 01:51:39,983
It is accomplished.

515
01:52:02,144 --> 01:52:05,773
Father, into your hands...

516
01:52:06,815 --> 01:52:11,047
...I commend... my spirit.

517
01:54:03,799 --> 01:54:05,858
Cassius! Hurry!

518
01:54:06,435 --> 01:54:07,868
He's dead!

519
01:54:09,638 --> 01:54:11,105
Make sure!
