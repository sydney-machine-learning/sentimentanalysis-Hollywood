00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,735
Hi.

2
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:13,495
- How'd it go?
- Lousy.

3
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:17,375
Got a '63 Thunderbird
I would've sold in a day a year ago.

4
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,168
Now they just wanna look at the pictures.

5
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:23,004
You smell nice.

6
00:01:27,384 --> 00:01:28,968
How was your day?

7
00:01:29,135 --> 00:01:30,720
It was great.

8
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:34,015
We had a big breakthrough
in the Bulgari case.

9
00:01:34,557 --> 00:01:36,226
Really?

10
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:39,020
We found a boot print.

11
00:01:39,187 --> 00:01:41,564
A really good one.

12
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:45,110
The left heel was worn way down.

13
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:50,990
That's a good lead.

14
00:01:51,157 --> 00:01:52,617
I know.

15
00:01:52,784 --> 00:01:54,869
We found a hair.

16
00:01:55,036 --> 00:01:56,496
A hair, wow.

17
00:01:56,663 --> 00:01:58,289
It's at the lab.

18
00:01:58,456 --> 00:02:02,585
So hopefully by noon tomorrow
we'll find out his DNA...

19
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:05,839
...what kind of conditioner he uses,
if he streaks his hair...

20
00:02:06,005 --> 00:02:09,926
...if he has dandruff, everything.
Isn't that amazing?

21
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:12,095
That is amazing.

22
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:16,266
You know, having those
extra men really paid off.

23
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:18,560
Oh, you're just being modest.

24
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:21,271
Are you coming to bed, baby?

25
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:24,774
I'm just gonna have a shower.
Don't let me keep you up.

26
00:03:07,108 --> 00:03:08,526
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

27
00:03:08,693 --> 00:03:12,113
- And you are Mr...?
- Diaz. Miguel Diaz.

28
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,159
- And you're here to open a...?
- A SEP retirement account.

29
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:20,038
Terrific. Oh, it says here
you're already retired.

30
00:03:20,205 --> 00:03:22,624
- I am.
- What was your occupation?

31
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:25,668
I was a high school basketball coach.

32
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:28,338
You must have done
very well for yourself.

33
00:03:28,505 --> 00:03:30,090
- What's your name?
- Greg.

34
00:03:30,256 --> 00:03:34,677
Greg. Let me ask you something.
Do you have safe-deposit boxes here?

35
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:36,846
Yes, they're housed in our vault.

36
00:03:37,013 --> 00:03:39,808
- New vault?
- It's over 100 years old.

37
00:03:39,974 --> 00:03:43,520
Of course, we've made some
state-of-the-art upgrades since then.

38
00:03:43,686 --> 00:03:47,190
You know, I was once in a vault
while it was being robbed.

39
00:03:47,649 --> 00:03:50,902
That must have been quite an experience.

40
00:03:51,236 --> 00:03:52,654
Yeah.

41
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,869
Yeah.

42
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:14,008
That's too oxblood.

43
00:04:18,096 --> 00:04:19,889
What do y'all do?

44
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:22,892
My husband and I?

45
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:27,647
Well, he's retired. Just retired.

46
00:04:27,814 --> 00:04:30,275
It's great. It's...

47
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:34,529
And I did work at an art gallery.

48
00:04:34,696 --> 00:04:39,242
And, you know, I love art,
obviously, and paint and...

49
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:42,537
That's too brown. I'm sorry.
Do you mind if I...?

50
00:04:42,704 --> 00:04:45,248
- Hey, it's your paint.
- Okay. Thank you.

51
00:04:57,677 --> 00:05:00,305
May I show you something specific?

52
00:05:00,472 --> 00:05:03,600
Well, I was looking
for something for my wife.

53
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:05,435
What is it, a special occasion?

54
00:05:05,602 --> 00:05:08,229
It's our second third anniversary.

55
00:05:08,396 --> 00:05:11,691
Excuse me. Hello, Mrs. Diaz,
we were just talking about you.

56
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:14,903
- How'd it go at the bank?
- It was easy.

57
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,488
I mean great.

58
00:05:16,654 --> 00:05:18,281
No, you mean easy.

59
00:05:18,448 --> 00:05:19,866
What?

60
00:05:20,283 --> 00:05:22,660
You're doing recon work
on our anniversary?

61
00:05:22,827 --> 00:05:25,163
- Tess.
- Let me ask you this:

62
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,333
- Where are you now?
- Casing a jewelry store.

63
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:32,712
That's an interesting way to ease back
into society, which was your idea.

64
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:34,923
- Should I stop painting now?
- Listen.

65
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:39,094
Let's talk about something important.
I can't find a restaurant for tonight.

66
00:05:40,095 --> 00:05:42,680
- Well, we'll stay in.
- Really?

67
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:46,601
- Great. I'll cook.
- No, I'll cook. You talk.

68
00:05:46,768 --> 00:05:48,561
You want me to talk?

69
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:52,524
Words and everything? That's what
they make flowers for, you know.

70
00:05:56,027 --> 00:05:59,030
- Oh, no, Danny.
- What is it?

71
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:02,158
Tess...

72
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:03,785
...what's wrong?

73
00:06:04,786 --> 00:06:07,956
There's water in the basement
and the pilot light is out.

74
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:09,666
Hang up!

75
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,350
Hello, Tess.

76
00:06:39,904 --> 00:06:41,740
Where is he, Tess?

77
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,285
Where is...

78
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:47,871
...Mr. Diaz?

79
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:58,715
I want it back, Tess.

80
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:00,759
I want it all back.

81
00:07:01,384 --> 00:07:02,427
You got it all...

82
00:07:02,594 --> 00:07:05,263
...from the insurance company.
- I want my money back.

83
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:08,725
The money that your husband
and his 10 friends stole from me.

84
00:07:08,892 --> 00:07:12,687
With interest. A hundred and sixty
million dollars over three years.

85
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:14,898
That's a lot of vig.

86
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:16,733
And I want it all back.

87
00:07:27,077 --> 00:07:29,079
He's got two weeks.

88
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,293
You'll never find them.

89
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:37,879
They're way too smart for you.

90
00:07:39,255 --> 00:07:40,757
Right.

91
00:07:42,634 --> 00:07:44,469
You know, as it turns out...

92
00:07:44,636 --> 00:07:49,015
...I'm not the only person in the world
looking for Ocean's 11.

93
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,081
All right.

94
00:08:14,457 --> 00:08:18,211
I'm the groom, and I'm not supposed
to say anything, but... Make a speech.

95
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:22,841
But I don't care what the rules are,
because I really wanna thank my family.

96
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:26,428
My mom and dad,
my Uncle Gary and Aunt Grace.

97
00:08:26,594 --> 00:08:28,555
Uncle Ted, Aunt Celeste...

98
00:08:28,722 --> 00:08:32,642
...and their children, Denise and Jessica.

99
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,896
Bishop Tom and his wife, Helen,
my neighbor John...

100
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:39,274
...and his new girlfriend, Tanya.

101
00:08:39,441 --> 00:08:43,027
And all the guys at Lean Machine Inc,
Bobo, Mullethead...

102
00:08:43,194 --> 00:08:44,946
...Big Sam.

103
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:50,035
And everyone else
who's just been great...

104
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:53,371
...in welcoming Sara
into the family. Thank you.

105
00:09:00,503 --> 00:09:04,257
Excuse me, everybody. I'd just like to...

106
00:09:04,424 --> 00:09:06,342
- Get up.
- Get up.

107
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,803
- Get up.
- Get up. Get up.

108
00:09:09,012 --> 00:09:10,472
- Walk.
- Walk.

109
00:09:12,557 --> 00:09:16,644
I'd like to say a few words
about commitment...

110
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:18,855
...about honor...

111
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:21,775
...about responsibility...

112
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:26,071
...about a very special someone
and admitting to her...

113
00:09:26,237 --> 00:09:29,032
Get up. Pull the chair out.

114
00:09:32,535 --> 00:09:36,081
Admitting to her in front of everybody...

115
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:38,541
...that her wedding...

116
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:43,380
...and that very special
honeymoon trip to Epcot Center...

117
00:09:44,381 --> 00:09:46,549
...will have to be postponed.

118
00:09:49,094 --> 00:09:53,515
The photographer. He's just a friend.
You met him at The Mint, remember?

119
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,018
Well, of course I am.

120
00:09:57,185 --> 00:10:01,189
You don't expect me to embarrass myself
by flying commercial?

121
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:05,902
On a budget? On a budget?

122
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:10,198
Who was the only person who couldn't
get in on the Chinese cell-phone market?

123
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:13,618
You, with all your connections.
What was that?

124
00:10:16,454 --> 00:10:20,583
He seemed really nice. And you know
it's hard for guys to be friends with me.

125
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,254
And you do this every time
that I meet someone new.

126
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:29,008
And you know what?
It's getting really boring.

127
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:49,446
You think it's a accident no
one know about Fred "Bud" Kelly?

128
00:10:50,822 --> 00:10:53,158
Ain't no accident.
There's one explanation...

129
00:10:53,324 --> 00:10:55,744
...and you ladies know
exactly what it is.

130
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,537
I'm gonna tell you what it is.

131
00:10:57,704 --> 00:11:01,833
Conspiracy, collusion, complicity.
That's all it is.

132
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,004
Let me break it down like a fraction
for you about my man Fred "Bud" Kelly.

133
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:08,965
Fred "Bud" Kelly made skates
out of whiskey bottles...

134
00:11:09,132 --> 00:11:13,970
...at his uncle's farm in the early 1900s.
That was over there in Nova Scotia.

135
00:11:14,137 --> 00:11:18,391
I'm gonna tell you something else. You
never seen his name on the Stanley Cup.

136
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:22,353
You know why that is?
Because that son of a bitch Jim Crow...

137
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,899
...took his name off the history books.
You kind of...

138
00:11:26,316 --> 00:11:29,903
Seems like every time I see you,
you're playing the race card, Frank.

139
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,863
Now, why is that?

140
00:11:32,822 --> 00:11:35,075
You can let go of my feet now.

141
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:44,542
- This don't bother you?
- Of course it ******* bothers me, mate.

142
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:48,171
- What the **** do you want me to do?
- Well, it's ****** up.

143
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:50,131
You can't hear none of the lyrics.

144
00:11:50,298 --> 00:11:53,718
You can't get with the beat
with all them ******* bleeps in it.

145
00:11:53,885 --> 00:11:56,179
You want a ******* single
on the ******* radio...

146
00:11:56,346 --> 00:11:58,014
...it's what you have to ******* do.

147
00:11:58,181 --> 00:12:00,558
Well, it's ******, isn't it?
Totally ******!

148
00:12:00,725 --> 00:12:03,186
******* right, it's *************.

149
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:06,815
What the **** is that?

150
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:10,151
Somebody must be in 2.

151
00:12:13,738 --> 00:12:15,740
Oh, ****!

152
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:23,748
And you haven't contacted
my father about any of this?

153
00:12:23,915 --> 00:12:28,378
Because, really, I don't think there's
any reason to involve him or my mom.

154
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,428
It's all on you, Linus.

155
00:12:37,178 --> 00:12:39,764
Okay. Good.

156
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:43,977
- Good. Because I have a whole network...
- Get out of my car.

157
00:12:44,144 --> 00:12:45,770
Thank you.

158
00:12:48,857 --> 00:12:50,650
- Mr. Bloom?
- Yes.

159
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:53,528
There appears to be
a slight problem with your card.

160
00:12:56,489 --> 00:12:59,325
Oh, well, yes. Here.

161
00:12:59,492 --> 00:13:01,077
I'm afraid not, sir.

162
00:13:01,244 --> 00:13:02,704
Why?

163
00:13:02,871 --> 00:13:05,415
Your business manager
said you would understand.

164
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:07,625
Todd said I would understand?

165
00:13:07,792 --> 00:13:10,670
No, Mr. Benedict.

166
00:13:10,837 --> 00:13:15,341
Mr. Benedict. Mr...

167
00:13:15,508 --> 00:13:17,343
Oh, yes.

168
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,512
An old friend, a practical joker.

169
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,974
Tell Mr. Benedict
he's won this round, yes.

170
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:25,727
Terry Benedict.

171
00:13:26,352 --> 00:13:28,938
Old Terry.

172
00:13:29,105 --> 00:13:31,608
She's looking at me
from across the room.

173
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,319
And she's crazy about me, I can tell...

174
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:38,907
...because she's been staring
at me all night. So suddenly...

175
00:13:39,074 --> 00:13:42,160
...I just go up to her, and I grab her.

176
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:44,871
And I've got her really close to me...

177
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:47,499
...and her eyes are all fiery.

178
00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:50,126
And my eyes are fiery.

179
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:53,004
And it's like... It's electric.

180
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:56,883
And I say to her, "Mom...

181
00:13:58,802 --> 00:14:00,678
Mother... "

182
00:14:02,514 --> 00:14:04,182
What?

183
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,438
Thanks for letting me finish.

184
00:14:12,065 --> 00:14:13,942
What can I say?

185
00:14:14,109 --> 00:14:16,027
You're a funny guy.

186
00:14:19,364 --> 00:14:22,200
Oh, yeah. My friend Rusty.
I'm worried about him.

187
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:24,452
He owns this hotel in Los Angeles...

188
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:27,539
...losing a lot of money,
and he's got no life.

189
00:14:27,706 --> 00:14:31,501
He's a nice, bright kid,
but he's beating his brains out.

190
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:36,297
Do you think I could send something
through you, like, a message to him?

191
00:14:36,464 --> 00:14:38,758
I read your palm, not his.

192
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:41,886
Somebody who could do that could do
very well. Anything on my health?

193
00:14:42,053 --> 00:14:44,639
- My hips are bothering me.
- Please.

194
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:50,687
This? You couldn't see this?

195
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,193
- I tried knocking, he won't open.
- I'll handle it. I know him.

196
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,738
Jesus Christ, are you people retarded?

197
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:03,074
- It says, "Do not disturb"!
- It's me.

198
00:15:10,373 --> 00:15:11,791
Hey.

199
00:15:13,168 --> 00:15:14,753
Come on in.

200
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:18,256
Jeez, Topher, you didn't
have to go all Frankie Muniz on me.

201
00:15:18,423 --> 00:15:21,718
I'm sorry. Rust, look, I know
this is your joint.

202
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:23,303
I just...

203
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:26,264
There's this girl.

204
00:15:27,307 --> 00:15:29,309
I love her, man.

205
00:15:29,476 --> 00:15:32,520
I love her, but she is driving me crazy!

206
00:15:32,687 --> 00:15:34,773
I can't sleep. I can't work.

207
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:38,234
I quit the show. I totally phoned in
that Dennis Quaid movie.

208
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:41,029
- I mean, it's like...
- Hello?

209
00:15:41,196 --> 00:15:44,949
God, it's almost like this
Kabbalah crap doesn't even work!

210
00:15:45,116 --> 00:15:47,952
Rusty, call for you.

211
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,333
Dude, don't leave.

212
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:55,502
- Yeah?
- I have a message...

213
00:15:55,668 --> 00:16:00,632
...for Robert Charles Ryan, soon to be
ex-owner of the Standard Hotel.

214
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:05,261
- You got him.
- Last time we spoke, you hung up on me.

215
00:16:05,428 --> 00:16:08,181
You used some nasty words.
I got sensitive ears.

216
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:10,850
I admit I was a little
emotional that evening.

217
00:16:11,017 --> 00:16:13,144
Think about that night a lot,
don't you?

218
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:16,523
I thought I'd be dead before
I heard the sound that killed me.

219
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:20,360
I've been asked to show restraint.
Otherwise, you would've gone out...

220
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:22,904
...to your favorite car of all
the 17 you own...

221
00:16:23,071 --> 00:16:26,032
...and as soon as you turned
on the ignition...

222
00:16:30,245 --> 00:16:32,205
You got two weeks.

223
00:16:41,756 --> 00:16:45,510
Now, you told me that your wife said
that he called it Ocean's 11.

224
00:16:45,677 --> 00:16:48,555
Now, who decided that?
I'm a private contractor.

225
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:51,349
It was a collaboration.
That moniker is insulting.

226
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:53,435
It was one job we did together.

227
00:16:53,601 --> 00:16:57,605
I don't know where this proprietary stance
comes from. It seems possessive.

228
00:16:57,772 --> 00:17:00,608
One could argue that
because it was Danny's idea...

229
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:03,778
Hang on a minute.
We all had our own areas of expertise.

230
00:17:03,945 --> 00:17:06,614
I mean, without us,
it don't leave your head, mate.

231
00:17:06,781 --> 00:17:08,700
It just hurts, you know, because...

232
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:12,037
...it seemed we all agreed
to call it "the Benedict job. "

233
00:17:12,203 --> 00:17:14,622
That's what we called it
when we were doing it.

234
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:16,958
If you wanted to call it
something else...

235
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,335
When you have a problem,
who do you go to?

236
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:21,546
- Rusty.
- Rusty.

237
00:17:21,713 --> 00:17:23,548
Thanks.
Let's get back on the topic.

238
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:26,843
Based on what we stole, plus interest...

239
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:31,306
...how much does everybody owe?
- $17.34 million.

240
00:17:31,473 --> 00:17:35,393
Assuming Benedict gives us
prime plus one, which I doubt.

241
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,562
Figure 19 to be safe.

242
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:41,566
Okay, 19 each. Anybody got that?

243
00:17:43,568 --> 00:17:46,488
What, you think the stock market's
some great mystery...

244
00:17:46,654 --> 00:17:50,784
...beyond the realm of human
understanding? Didn't you see the signs?

245
00:17:53,078 --> 00:17:55,121
I saw the signs.

246
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:56,915
How much is everybody short?

247
00:17:57,082 --> 00:17:58,333
How much you short?

248
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:01,461
Fourteen. Fourteen.

249
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:04,422
- All but 5 million?
- Yeah. You gonna start with me?

250
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:07,926
You don't know what it's like
to create something from scratch.

251
00:18:08,093 --> 00:18:10,720
- Well, with interest, I'm short 7.
- Eight.

252
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:13,973
I spent about a million,
mostly on talent development.

253
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,435
That makes it 7 for me.
Boy, the interest just kills you.

254
00:18:17,602 --> 00:18:19,771
- I'm light 9.
- What's the interest?

255
00:18:19,938 --> 00:18:22,649
- About 6.
- Then I owe 6.

256
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:24,275
- How?
- What?

257
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:26,778
I've been staying at my parents'.

258
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,031
I owe 25.

259
00:18:32,784 --> 00:18:34,786
Hotels, man.

260
00:18:35,537 --> 00:18:36,955
Saul?

261
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:41,167
I haven't spent it all, but I will.

262
00:18:41,626 --> 00:18:43,712
I'm out, fellas.

263
00:18:43,878 --> 00:18:48,550
As ranking old-timer,
I gotta say, I just can't do it.

264
00:18:49,134 --> 00:18:53,596
At my age, I think I earned
the right to be selfish.

265
00:18:53,763 --> 00:18:58,476
I wanna thank you all for the wonderful
opportunity. You're all aces in my book.

266
00:18:58,643 --> 00:19:03,523
But I want the last check
I write to bounce.

267
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:07,902
Saul, you having a laugh?

268
00:19:08,236 --> 00:19:09,696
Saul.

269
00:19:14,868 --> 00:19:17,495
- I can handle Saul's share.
- You don't have to.

270
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:20,165
Who would I talk to
if you were all dead?

271
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:23,918
That's a good point.
All right, I owe 10. Amazing?

272
00:19:28,673 --> 00:19:30,592
Yeah, but it's a nice place.

273
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:34,929
- So that comes to...?
- Ninety-seven, give or take.

274
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:37,515
He didn't find us on his own.

275
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:40,101
- Someone helped him.
- Another thief.

276
00:19:40,268 --> 00:19:42,854
Nobody we know would
violate rule number one.

277
00:19:43,021 --> 00:19:46,232
What we do know is we need a job.
We need a high-paying job.

278
00:19:46,399 --> 00:19:48,860
We're too hot to work
anywhere in this country.

279
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:52,530
- So we go abroad. How about we go...?
- We're on the 5:00.

280
00:19:53,156 --> 00:19:55,200
Good. Where are we going?

281
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:57,744
- Amsterdam.
- Amsterdam it is.

282
00:19:57,911 --> 00:20:00,955
- Clock's running. Let's go.
- Never been to Amsterdam.

283
00:20:01,122 --> 00:20:03,583
I hear German girls are really hot.

284
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:05,502
Rusty.

285
00:20:06,044 --> 00:20:08,046
- Amsterdam?
- Yeah.

286
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:10,882
Don't tell Danny.

287
00:20:17,764 --> 00:20:20,558
Hey, Rusty. Rusty.

288
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,186
Sorry, sorry. Hey.

289
00:20:23,353 --> 00:20:25,271
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

290
00:20:25,438 --> 00:20:26,689
- Nothing.
- What?

291
00:20:26,856 --> 00:20:28,733
- Can I...? Can I...?
- What?

292
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,695
- Just for a second, can I talk to you?
- What's wrong?

293
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:33,613
I just... I don't know.

294
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:37,409
This might not be the perfect time
or whatever to talk about it.

295
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:39,703
- Okay.
- I've been thinking.

296
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,542
I've been doing my homework.

297
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:48,420
And I'd really like...

298
00:20:48,586 --> 00:20:51,548
...to play a more central role
this time around.

299
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,591
- Right.
- I feel like I've...

300
00:20:53,758 --> 00:20:55,719
- Right.
- I'm ready for that, and I...

301
00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:57,095
Way overdue.

302
00:20:57,262 --> 00:21:01,307
I was wondering if I could come to
the meeting and help you guys negotiate.

303
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:06,479
Okay. It's just a sit-down with Matsui.

304
00:21:08,231 --> 00:21:10,150
He's got his own language, this guy.

305
00:21:10,316 --> 00:21:14,154
I watched you and Danny really closely
last time around. I learned a ton.

306
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,116
Linus, in my professional opinion,
you're not ready.

307
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:22,704
- Okay. Yeah, I mean...
- But... But... But...

308
00:21:22,871 --> 00:21:25,874
...if you're convinced you are ready...

309
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:28,960
...I can speak with Danny.
We can make this happen.

310
00:21:29,127 --> 00:21:31,671
But you gotta be sure.

311
00:21:36,634 --> 00:21:37,927
- Not sure?
- No, I am.

312
00:21:38,094 --> 00:21:40,930
- You're sure?
- But if I had a question, I could...

313
00:21:41,097 --> 00:21:42,932
- You would call me?
- Right. Okay.

314
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:44,684
Any time.

315
00:21:44,851 --> 00:21:46,352
- Okay.
- Okay.

316
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:48,521
- All right.
- Okay. Awesome. Thank you.

317
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:50,023
Yeah.

318
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:55,779
I almost wasn't gonna
come over and say anything.

319
00:21:55,945 --> 00:21:58,323
Then I'd still be sleeping.

320
00:21:58,907 --> 00:22:00,950
- Thanks, buddy.
- Yeah.

321
00:22:31,356 --> 00:22:33,358
- Who's there?
- Li... It's...

322
00:22:33,525 --> 00:22:35,235
- What?
- It's Linus.

323
00:22:35,402 --> 00:22:37,779
Is Rusty here? Rusty...?

324
00:22:38,071 --> 00:22:40,407
- Do you know where Rusty is?
- No.

325
00:22:40,824 --> 00:22:42,617
So have you met Matsui?

326
00:22:42,784 --> 00:22:45,370
Seriously, what do you think of me...

327
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:48,289
...you know, in terms
of just leadership potential?

328
00:24:09,704 --> 00:24:11,915
The fact that we're unemployable
shouldn't enter your mind.

329
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:14,918
Otherwise, you're wasting time.

330
00:24:15,085 --> 00:24:17,420
Don't mention Benedict
unless he does first.

331
00:24:17,587 --> 00:24:19,506
And if he does, tell him everything.

332
00:24:19,672 --> 00:24:23,218
Right. Stay on point. And don't
forget the other thing I told you.

333
00:24:23,385 --> 00:24:24,677
- What?
- About listening.

334
00:24:24,844 --> 00:24:27,680
Relax. Remember, if we don't
get this job, we're dead.

335
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:30,058
Rusty, I tried calling you
all yesterday.

336
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,104
So finally, she slams her vodka tonic
down on the tray and says:

337
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:38,942
"Hey, maybe that's why
I've been feeling so warm recently. "

338
00:24:53,415 --> 00:24:55,041
Yeah.

339
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:59,838
- So to business?
- To business.

340
00:25:00,004 --> 00:25:03,133
A doctor who specializes
in skin diseases...

341
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:06,594
...will dream he has fallen asleep
in front of the television.

342
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:09,556
Later, he will wake up
in front of the television...

343
00:25:09,723 --> 00:25:12,058
...but not remember his dream.

344
00:25:14,769 --> 00:25:16,604
Would you agree?

345
00:25:26,322 --> 00:25:30,827
If all the animals along the equator
were capable of flattery...

346
00:25:31,536 --> 00:25:34,372
...then Thanksgiving and Halloween...

347
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:37,459
...would fall on the same date.

348
00:25:39,044 --> 00:25:40,837
Yeah. Hey.

349
00:25:45,675 --> 00:25:47,719
When I was 4 years old...

350
00:25:47,886 --> 00:25:52,223
...I watched my mother
kill a spider with a tea cozy.

351
00:25:54,851 --> 00:25:57,937
Years later, I realized
it was not a spider.

352
00:25:58,104 --> 00:26:00,440
It was my Uncle Harold.

353
00:26:19,209 --> 00:26:23,129
Oh, let the sun beat down
upon my face

354
00:26:23,296 --> 00:26:25,757
Stars to fill my dreams

355
00:26:26,549 --> 00:26:30,553
I am a traveler in both time and space

356
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,431
To be where I have been

357
00:26:49,322 --> 00:26:51,574
Is he all right? Are we all right?

358
00:26:51,741 --> 00:26:54,703
- "Kashmir"?
- Is that your idea of a contribution?

359
00:26:54,869 --> 00:26:58,206
- We hadn't even started yet.
- We were this close to losing that.

360
00:26:58,373 --> 00:27:02,585
Okay, I don't even understand what
happened in there. What did I say?

361
00:27:02,961 --> 00:27:05,255
- You called his niece a whore.
- A cheap one.

362
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:07,841
- She's 7.
- Confined to bed with a case of...

363
00:27:08,007 --> 00:27:10,385
- No, don't tell him about it.
- I'm sorry.

364
00:27:11,094 --> 00:27:14,055
Okay. So, what does this mean?

365
00:27:14,222 --> 00:27:16,015
It means you stay here.

366
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,607
The mark's name is van der Woude.
A semi-known, wealthy recluse.

367
00:27:24,774 --> 00:27:27,777
He claims to sell antiques,
but hasn't actually sold one.

368
00:27:27,944 --> 00:27:31,281
His store is his privately owned home,
which no one ever enters.

369
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:34,242
But don't let van der Woude's
eccentricity fool you.

370
00:27:34,409 --> 00:27:37,620
The house is extremely well-protected.

371
00:27:56,181 --> 00:27:58,099
- What are we after?
- It's a document.

372
00:27:58,266 --> 00:28:00,393
It's a very old, very valuable document.

373
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,854
- Yeah, what is it?
- A stock certificate.

374
00:28:03,021 --> 00:28:06,608
The first one ever issued
from the first corporation on the planet.

375
00:28:06,775 --> 00:28:08,735
Dutch East India Trading Company.

376
00:28:08,902 --> 00:28:11,237
- The only one of its kind.
- What's the take?

377
00:28:11,404 --> 00:28:13,073
2.5 million euro.

378
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:15,241
Wait. Each?

379
00:28:15,408 --> 00:28:18,078
- No.
- Who negotiated this?

380
00:28:18,244 --> 00:28:21,956
- That's a lot of money to a lot of people.
- Are you out of your mind?

381
00:28:22,123 --> 00:28:25,960
If we do one job a week at that rate,
we won't pay Benedict off until...

382
00:28:26,127 --> 00:28:28,755
- September 2005.
- Jesus Christ, Danny.

383
00:28:28,922 --> 00:28:31,174
I hear you, but it's what's available.

384
00:28:31,341 --> 00:28:32,926
After we pull this job off...

385
00:28:33,093 --> 00:28:36,679
...Matsui's gonna throw us another.
It's gonna pay 10 times this one.

386
00:28:36,846 --> 00:28:39,641
- Which buys an extension from Benedict.
- You hope.

387
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:44,229
I hope. Now, the good news is that
Matsui gave us the system's master code.

388
00:28:44,396 --> 00:28:46,815
- So, what are we waiting for?
- Van der Woude.

389
00:28:46,981 --> 00:28:48,983
- That's the bad news.
- He never leaves.

390
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:51,903
- He's agoraphobic.
- He's never been out of his house?

391
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:55,573
- Not in 10 years since he moved in.
- Does he believe in fresh air?

392
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,284
- He opens his window.
- What does that mean?

393
00:28:58,451 --> 00:29:00,745
- Best time of arrival.
- Means he opens his window.

394
00:29:00,912 --> 00:29:03,998
Every night at 1:30 he takes an Ambien,
puts on Beethoven's Third.

395
00:29:04,165 --> 00:29:08,086
By the fourth movement, he's out
like a light. So we go in at 3 a. m.

396
00:29:08,253 --> 00:29:11,339
Okay, can we tap into the system
from the phone lines?

397
00:29:11,506 --> 00:29:16,302
It's a closed-loop system with two servers
locked in titanium cases next to his bed.

398
00:29:16,469 --> 00:29:18,680
- So hacking in is out.
- Look at this.

399
00:29:18,847 --> 00:29:21,683
Telephone-repair truck,
basket up to the second floor.

400
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:25,061
Telescoping rod through the window,
tap out the freak's code.

401
00:29:25,228 --> 00:29:28,940
- Dumb idea. One lane, one-way streets.
- Dumb idea.

402
00:29:29,107 --> 00:29:31,776
All right? Any stoppage
will bring cops.

403
00:29:31,943 --> 00:29:34,946
The outside is covered
by five surveillance cameras.

404
00:29:35,113 --> 00:29:37,574
Monitored 24 hours a day
by a security company.

405
00:29:37,741 --> 00:29:40,410
He's got five exterior cameras?

406
00:29:40,577 --> 00:29:42,370
- This guy is a freak.
- Super freak.

407
00:29:42,537 --> 00:29:44,122
What about through the roof?

408
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:48,001
- Two more cameras, pressure sensors...
- A laser net over the trap door...

409
00:29:48,168 --> 00:29:49,627
- Smoke the freak out.
- Yeah.

410
00:29:49,794 --> 00:29:52,047
- Smoke the freak out.
- Hey!

411
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:54,090
- What?
- Do we have to use that term?

412
00:29:54,257 --> 00:29:56,801
- What term?
- "Freak. "

413
00:29:58,678 --> 00:30:02,557
The National Institute of Mental Health
estimates 5.6 percent of adults...

414
00:30:02,724 --> 00:30:05,268
...develop "agraphoriaphobia. "
- Agoraphobia.

415
00:30:05,435 --> 00:30:08,480
Whatever. I'm just saying,
I mean, do we...?

416
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:11,858
We don't need to be an
organization that labels people.

417
00:30:12,025 --> 00:30:14,152
Oh, now we're an organization?

418
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:16,154
You'd call Emily Dickinson a freak?

419
00:30:16,321 --> 00:30:19,824
- Are you hosting a telethon?
- Who's Emily Dickinson?

420
00:30:19,991 --> 00:30:24,788
Am I the only one who feels funny
about stealing from a...?

421
00:30:24,954 --> 00:30:26,998
You know, a handicapped guy?

422
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:29,876
- Well, I don't care.
- Hell, yeah.

423
00:30:30,043 --> 00:30:32,420
I feel funny about other things.

424
00:30:32,837 --> 00:30:34,089
Cool.

425
00:30:34,255 --> 00:30:35,715
But...

426
00:30:35,882 --> 00:30:37,342
- Yeah?
- But...

427
00:30:37,509 --> 00:30:38,718
- Right.
- What?

428
00:30:38,885 --> 00:30:41,846
- Ahab with a piggyback. Livingston?
- I can get anything.

429
00:30:42,013 --> 00:30:43,556
- It's done.
- Ahab with what?

430
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:45,892
- Boys.
- You're making that up. That's...

431
00:30:46,059 --> 00:30:49,646
That whole "Ahab with
a piggyback," that's not real?

432
00:30:49,938 --> 00:30:52,065
- Let me in.
- How do you think it feels...

433
00:30:52,232 --> 00:30:55,485
...when someone bangs on the door?
- I gotta go to the toilet.

434
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:58,238
Otherwise, I'm gonna shit on your feet.
Come on.

435
00:31:33,231 --> 00:31:35,275
Show me them specs.

436
00:31:40,822 --> 00:31:44,325
I've been doing this since I'm 12
years old. You're micromanaging.

437
00:31:44,492 --> 00:31:48,496
You gotta find people you can delegate
to. Otherwise, you'll never have a life.

438
00:31:48,663 --> 00:31:52,250
I don't want a life. I want the hotel
to run like a hotel should.

439
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:53,918
Reuben.

440
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:55,545
Yeah.

441
00:31:56,504 --> 00:31:58,006
Great.

442
00:31:58,173 --> 00:32:01,092
- Okay. Good.
- Maybe.

443
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,762
Fantastic.

444
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:10,060
Remember in Miller's Crossing
where Turturro begs for his life?

445
00:32:10,226 --> 00:32:13,438
Sure. "Look into your heart. "

446
00:32:13,605 --> 00:32:15,482
I cry every time.

447
00:32:15,857 --> 00:32:17,192
What?

448
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,444
We have no line of sight.

449
00:32:20,945 --> 00:32:24,532
Our only possibility, the window.
We're three inches too high.

450
00:32:24,699 --> 00:32:26,826
There's no clear shot, even with Basher.

451
00:32:26,993 --> 00:32:30,914
In the physical universe we occupy,
it cannot be done.

452
00:32:31,289 --> 00:32:33,458
What about the guy
from the Bulgari job?

453
00:32:33,625 --> 00:32:35,960
- Nagel. Spoke with him.
- Anything?

454
00:32:36,127 --> 00:32:38,838
Lot of ideas, none of them any good.

455
00:32:39,005 --> 00:32:41,341
He's pushing this new
holographic technology.

456
00:32:41,508 --> 00:32:45,762
Really interesting stuff, though.
He can reproduce anything 3-D.

457
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:48,306
How about 97 million?

458
00:32:49,891 --> 00:32:51,559
We're forcing it.

459
00:32:51,726 --> 00:32:54,020
Yeah, we're forcing it.

460
00:32:55,105 --> 00:32:57,357
- You know what we haven't thought of?
- What?

461
00:32:57,524 --> 00:32:59,192
We turn ourselves in.

462
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:02,112
- What could Benedict do to us then?
- There you go.

463
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:05,448
Call the cops,
tell them we did the Bellagio job.

464
00:33:05,615 --> 00:33:08,576
They put us away for 20 years.
That'd teach him.

465
00:33:09,035 --> 00:33:10,745
I think Tess would stick around.

466
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,997
You look great in jumpsuits.

467
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,250
Hey...

468
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:17,669
...how's the hotel business?
- Sucks.

469
00:33:17,836 --> 00:33:20,797
- How's East Haven?
- Sucks.

470
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,092
I don't know.

471
00:33:25,719 --> 00:33:28,847
Can't turn my brain off, you know.
It's me.

472
00:33:29,764 --> 00:33:33,268
We go into some place, and all I can
do is see the angles.

473
00:33:33,435 --> 00:33:37,856
It's what I do. It's what I've always done.
I love it.

474
00:33:38,481 --> 00:33:40,150
I don't know.

475
00:33:40,442 --> 00:33:42,777
Some sort of weird irony, you know?

476
00:33:43,028 --> 00:33:45,530
Tess watching me scratch and itch.

477
00:33:45,697 --> 00:33:49,034
Hey, listen. You know, the world's
gone nuts and you're...

478
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:53,621
- What'd you wanna do?
- It's not attached...

479
00:33:53,788 --> 00:33:55,123
...to the adjacent buildings.

480
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:57,959
- The whole house?
- We're just raising it slightly.

481
00:33:58,126 --> 00:34:01,046
Schumann did it in '64 in Venice
and '73 in Istanbul.

482
00:34:01,212 --> 00:34:03,715
- He only had a crew of six.
- We can't tilt a house.

483
00:34:03,882 --> 00:34:07,385
- Did it with the Leaning Tower of Pizza.
- Exactly, thank you.

484
00:34:07,552 --> 00:34:10,930
- It took 300 men over two years to do it.
- There's 30 pylons.

485
00:34:11,097 --> 00:34:13,725
We cut them, insert the jacks
and crank away.

486
00:34:13,892 --> 00:34:17,062
It's really our best plan,
considering it's our only plan.

487
00:34:17,228 --> 00:34:21,566
- Crank for how long?
- Like I said, it's our only plan.

488
00:34:55,016 --> 00:34:56,267
What?

489
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,856
Oh, oh, okay, hold on.

490
00:35:09,698 --> 00:35:11,741
Try that.

491
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:06,796
Number five. I'm a go.

492
00:36:27,859 --> 00:36:33,198
Master thieves who practice the long con
live separate lives as civilians.

493
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:35,700
They have legitimate jobs and families...

494
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:38,995
...which make them extremely
difficult to catch.

495
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:43,625
The greatest thief of all time was,
without question...

496
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:49,506
...Gaspar LeMarc, who either died
in Portugal in 1988...

497
00:36:49,672 --> 00:36:55,595
...or in Hong Kong in 1996,
or he's still alive.

498
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:58,890
We may never know for certain
because LeMarc...

499
00:36:59,057 --> 00:37:02,060
...was never captured or photographed...

500
00:37:02,227 --> 00:37:06,106
...despite being active for over 50 years.

501
00:37:07,107 --> 00:37:10,068
Though he left behind a slew
of imitators...

502
00:37:10,235 --> 00:37:15,073
...only one is worth mentioning
in the same breath as LeMarc:

503
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,119
The thief we know only
as the Night Fox.

504
00:37:19,285 --> 00:37:23,748
So named for the small onyx figurines
he leaves behind to taunt us...

505
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:28,670
...the Night Fox must be considered
our number-one priority.

506
00:37:28,837 --> 00:37:34,050
His string of high-profile crimes are
an embarrassment to our branch...

507
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:36,761
...to our entire profession.

508
00:37:36,928 --> 00:37:42,809
We need more than traditional resources
to pursue thieves like the Night Fox.

509
00:37:42,976 --> 00:37:48,974
We need to train ourselves to think the
way they think, to see what they see.

510
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:52,277
And we should not allow ourselves
to be distracted...

511
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,323
What?

512
00:38:10,503 --> 00:38:13,923
Hi, Isabel. Well, we could really use
your help on this one.

513
00:38:14,215 --> 00:38:17,010
I hope the scene hasn't
been contaminated.

514
00:38:30,815 --> 00:38:33,151
When can I speak to Mr. van der Woude?

515
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:36,488
Probably tomorrow. He's heavily sedated.

516
00:38:36,654 --> 00:38:40,325
We can't figure out how they disabled
the alarm. Shorted it out somehow?

517
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:44,662
No, that would have triggered the system
and damaged the circuits.

518
00:38:45,705 --> 00:38:48,666
Well, then. Then I don't know
how they got in.

519
00:38:53,922 --> 00:38:57,425
They had the code. Someone other than
the owner must have known it.

520
00:38:57,592 --> 00:39:01,096
Impossible. Van der Woude programmed
the last nine steps of the system.

521
00:39:01,262 --> 00:39:04,099
He set it and never left the house again.

522
00:39:04,265 --> 00:39:08,311
Closed loop. Redundant servers.
Titanium encasement.

523
00:39:08,478 --> 00:39:09,938
It's not bad, actually.

524
00:39:42,137 --> 00:39:45,390
Yeah. Thanks.

525
00:40:01,197 --> 00:40:02,574
Do we know each other?

526
00:40:04,284 --> 00:40:07,996
- I think I saw you yesterday.
- Oh, yeah?

527
00:40:08,163 --> 00:40:10,707
Yeah, you were being chased
by the police.

528
00:40:10,874 --> 00:40:14,753
Chasing me? No. I don't think so.

529
00:40:14,919 --> 00:40:17,922
I'm quite sure it was you.

530
00:40:18,089 --> 00:40:20,216
Doesn't say much for the police.

531
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:27,223
No, I love Rome. I love it.

532
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:31,102
But there's an opening at work
the level above me, and it's...

533
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:34,606
I was thinking I was gonna try out for it.
It's in Amsterdam.

534
00:40:34,773 --> 00:40:39,194
My mother has family there, so it'd be...
It'd be good.

535
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:48,078
- He lifted the whole house?
- The whole house.

536
00:40:48,244 --> 00:40:50,246
- The entire house?
- The entire house.

537
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:52,582
It's called a Schumann Special...

538
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:56,878
...named after this guy, a brilliant guy,
Max Schumann.

539
00:40:57,295 --> 00:41:01,925
Then he did it in Istanbul in 1973.

540
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:04,260
What is it?

541
00:41:06,763 --> 00:41:09,265
It's where the crossbow bolt hit.

542
00:41:12,811 --> 00:41:15,313
The crossbow bolt?

543
00:41:16,648 --> 00:41:19,984
They fired from that rooftop through
this open window.

544
00:41:20,193 --> 00:41:23,321
With a crossbow bolt from that roof
through that window?

545
00:41:23,488 --> 00:41:27,283
- That's a very difficult shot.
- No, it is an impossible shot...

546
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,494
...until they raised the building.

547
00:41:29,661 --> 00:41:31,871
Check the pylons. They'll be elevated.

548
00:41:32,664 --> 00:41:35,542
- You know the name Max Schumann?
- No.

549
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:38,002
- Well, they do.
- Who?

550
00:41:38,169 --> 00:41:39,796
The Americans.

551
00:42:18,043 --> 00:42:19,669
Wait a minute.

552
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:30,180
Exactly. Why would they bring the drill
if they weren't planning to use it?

553
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:34,476
- What?
- Oh, God.

554
00:42:48,573 --> 00:42:51,159
- What?
- I don't know.

555
00:43:03,088 --> 00:43:04,631
Congratulations.

556
00:43:04,798 --> 00:43:09,469
You are the second person to crack
the van der Woude safe tonight.

557
00:43:09,636 --> 00:43:13,098
In arriving second, Mr. Ocean,
you have joined a long line...

558
00:43:13,264 --> 00:43:16,476
...of people who've worked hard
and risked a great deal...

559
00:43:16,643 --> 00:43:19,437
...only to get somewhere second.

560
00:43:20,605 --> 00:43:25,068
You don't know these people by name,
of course, because they enter oblivion.

561
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,028
You know this word, "oblivion"?

562
00:43:27,195 --> 00:43:31,324
It means to be totally forgotten
by everyone forever.

563
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:35,495
And it's where you would be now
if it weren't for the Bellagio heist.

564
00:43:35,662 --> 00:43:37,664
How does this guy know who we are?

565
00:43:37,831 --> 00:43:42,252
In a way, I'm responsible for you coming
to Amsterdam in the first place.

566
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:45,463
I hired Matsui, and Matsui hired you.

567
00:43:45,714 --> 00:43:47,882
That's the guy who dimed us
to Benedict.

568
00:43:49,175 --> 00:43:51,344
- All of them, including Ocean.
- Yes.

569
00:43:53,304 --> 00:43:56,725
I find that hard to believe.
And you are?

570
00:43:56,891 --> 00:43:58,893
You can call me the Night Fox.

571
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,480
The Night Fox. Okay, Mr. Night Fox.

572
00:44:02,647 --> 00:44:05,734
- What will this information cost me?
- Don't worry. Nothing.

573
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,821
Nothing? Who do you think you're
dealing with? Nothing costs nothing.

574
00:44:09,988 --> 00:44:12,657
And this information is definitely
worth something.

575
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:16,661
Let's just say our interests
are temporarily aligned.

576
00:44:16,828 --> 00:44:18,580
How so?

577
00:44:18,747 --> 00:44:22,333
Well, the information is free,
but it comes with certain conditions.

578
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,670
- Such as?
- Restraint on your part.

579
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:29,674
Restraint? That's asking a lot.
What else?

580
00:44:29,841 --> 00:44:32,343
Two weeks to buy themselves
out of trouble.

581
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:34,137
Two weeks?

582
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:38,016
I can live with that, even if they can't.

583
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:42,520
Just out of curiosity,
what will you make them pay?

584
00:44:42,687 --> 00:44:47,692
For letting them live?
Everything they stole, plus interest.

585
00:44:48,401 --> 00:44:50,195
A lot of interest.

586
00:44:50,362 --> 00:44:53,406
But didn't your insurance cover
what was stolen?

587
00:44:53,573 --> 00:44:55,200
Of course.

588
00:44:55,367 --> 00:44:58,036
So you're asking them to double
your money?

589
00:44:58,203 --> 00:45:00,205
Well, do you really think that's fair?

590
00:45:00,372 --> 00:45:04,793
Fair? I certainly hope not.
So, what about the information?

591
00:45:05,668 --> 00:45:08,171
Okay. It's on your desk.

592
00:45:11,132 --> 00:45:15,178
He was here. Around 3:30 this morning.
I can tell.

593
00:45:15,345 --> 00:45:17,305
- Who?
- The Night Fox.

594
00:45:20,058 --> 00:45:23,186
Go down to the Dampkring and pick up
a guy called Matsui.

595
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:25,397
Real name, Ian Nicolas McNally.

596
00:45:25,563 --> 00:45:30,235
The Night Fox was here at the same time
as the Americans? Why?

597
00:45:30,402 --> 00:45:33,405
That's what we're gonna find out.

598
00:45:38,034 --> 00:45:39,869
What is he doing?

599
00:45:40,787 --> 00:45:43,081
Get him out of there.

600
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,626
God.

601
00:46:46,311 --> 00:46:48,438
Hello, Frank.

602
00:46:48,688 --> 00:46:50,982
I can't understand what we did
to this guy.

603
00:46:51,149 --> 00:46:54,819
- Why does he have it out for us like this?
- How did he get that code?

604
00:46:54,986 --> 00:46:58,323
Doesn't matter. He broke rule
number one. He's on the list.

605
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:00,116
Great time for a turf war.

606
00:47:00,283 --> 00:47:04,829
I spoke with Frank's associate in Dublin.
She's trying to get us a name on this guy.

607
00:47:04,996 --> 00:47:07,749
Our train leaves tomorrow at 1:38, okay?

608
00:47:07,916 --> 00:47:10,001
- Where is Frank?
- I don't know.

609
00:47:10,168 --> 00:47:15,507
It's gonna get out. Then we'll be dead,
and no one will wanna work with us.

610
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:18,176
Housekeeping.

611
00:47:29,104 --> 00:47:31,940
Turndown service for Mr. Ryan.

612
00:47:41,032 --> 00:47:42,992
Hi.

613
00:47:47,956 --> 00:47:50,208
Nice room.

614
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:52,961
You have it all to yourself?

615
00:47:55,213 --> 00:47:57,549
You here to take me in?

616
00:47:58,091 --> 00:48:03,012
Why would I do that?
It's not as if you stole something.

617
00:48:05,056 --> 00:48:07,559
It's nice to see you again, Robert.

618
00:48:07,726 --> 00:48:09,477
You too.

619
00:48:09,644 --> 00:48:14,691
Of course, you've been seeing
plenty of me, haven't you?

620
00:48:17,235 --> 00:48:19,195
I like this one.

621
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:22,365
I call it "thief á la mode. "

622
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:32,167
Schumann Special, huh?

623
00:48:33,043 --> 00:48:36,254
I guess that's what I get
for opening my mouth.

624
00:48:36,421 --> 00:48:39,299
So, what about the Night Fox?

625
00:48:39,466 --> 00:48:41,718
Did he leave you a message?

626
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:45,263
What about the figurine?
You still have it?

627
00:48:49,351 --> 00:48:52,187
I suppose it's a compliment in a way.

628
00:48:52,354 --> 00:48:57,692
I guess he's threatened by you,
though I can't imagine why.

629
00:48:59,277 --> 00:49:02,405
You have no idea
what you're up against.

630
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:05,158
The French police think
he's better than LeMarc.

631
00:49:05,325 --> 00:49:07,410
Well, he is French.

632
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:10,121
Let me give you some advice.

633
00:49:10,288 --> 00:49:15,293
Find out how you offended him.
Apologize. Beg for mercy.

634
00:49:18,171 --> 00:49:20,090
Got to go.

635
00:49:20,715 --> 00:49:26,012
Any message for Frank?
He's been hanging around the station.

636
00:49:26,179 --> 00:49:27,972
On what charge?

637
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:33,353
Well, we found a print of a size 14
Hi-Tec Magnum boot at the crime scene.

638
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:35,313
And?

639
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,816
Bought with a fraudulent credit card.

640
00:49:37,982 --> 00:49:40,235
From that point on, well,
there's only one...

641
00:49:40,402 --> 00:49:43,947
...maybe two great nail salons
in Amsterdam.

642
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:03,883
- And you lied to us.
- Yeah, and to me.

643
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,721
Well, Frank knew.

644
00:50:07,887 --> 00:50:11,016
- Frank knew you were in touch?
- I wasn't in touch.

645
00:50:11,182 --> 00:50:13,226
I was more like keeping tabs.

646
00:50:13,601 --> 00:50:16,354
- She's a cop!
- Detective, actually.

647
00:50:16,521 --> 00:50:19,190
- Where'd she learn all the Schumann crap?
- Dad.

648
00:50:19,357 --> 00:50:20,900
- What, he was a cop?
- Thief.

649
00:50:21,067 --> 00:50:23,194
- Oh, God. Was he good?
- Oh, yeah.

650
00:50:23,361 --> 00:50:27,282
Great. Pissed-off ex-girlfriend
whose thief father...

651
00:50:27,449 --> 00:50:29,576
...taught her every trick in the book.

652
00:50:29,743 --> 00:50:31,619
Well, she just made Danny and Yen.

653
00:50:31,786 --> 00:50:35,749
In the next 48 hours, your pictures
will be in every police station.

654
00:50:35,915 --> 00:50:38,710
- Nobody looks at them.
- Nobody but cops.

655
00:50:38,877 --> 00:50:41,463
- Detectives.
- You'd think she'd have sympathy...

656
00:50:41,629 --> 00:50:45,550
...for us if her old man was a thief.
- Is that sympathy or empathy?

657
00:50:45,717 --> 00:50:49,679
No, her old man got popped a day
before her 9th birthday. Died in jail.

658
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:53,433
So I wouldn't count on much sympathy.
Or empathy.

659
00:50:53,725 --> 00:50:56,102
She's gonna have the hotel
under surveillance.

660
00:50:56,686 --> 00:51:00,982
Great. We'll just eat room service, watch
movies and wait for Benedict to kill us.

661
00:51:01,149 --> 00:51:02,901
- Who's on the $100 bill?
- Adams.

662
00:51:03,068 --> 00:51:05,195
- John Travolta.
- He said every problem...

663
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:07,197
...is an opportunity in disguise.

664
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:09,699
He couldn't say that with a
.45 in his mouth.

665
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:12,077
No, you're missing
the silver lining here.

666
00:51:12,243 --> 00:51:16,122
Now, she gave us a name, didn't she?
The Night Fox.

667
00:51:16,456 --> 00:51:20,877
One phone call, we'll find out everything
there is to know about this guy.

668
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:53,178
The name is M. Diaz.
D-I-A-Z.

669
00:52:54,012 --> 00:52:56,514
It's a black duffel bag.

670
00:52:57,932 --> 00:53:01,019
The team's in Rotterdam.
The bag's in Brussels.

671
00:53:01,186 --> 00:53:05,690
He's the modern man:
disconnected, frightened...

672
00:53:05,857 --> 00:53:08,526
...paranoid, but with good reason.

673
00:53:08,693 --> 00:53:12,197
It's too sad to be funny.
Unusable.

674
00:53:12,697 --> 00:53:15,200
- I think I can get 20 minutes out of it.
- Great.

675
00:53:15,367 --> 00:53:18,912
I got it. The team's in Barcelona.
The bag's in Madrid.

676
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:22,999
This is a moral issue
we're dealing with here.

677
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:26,920
And we don't have a grease man anymore
because he's in a bag somewhere.

678
00:53:27,087 --> 00:53:28,588
We got a bag man.

679
00:53:28,755 --> 00:53:31,216
Such an ape. An animal
with no feelings.

680
00:53:31,383 --> 00:53:33,301
- I have feelings.
- No, you don't.

681
00:53:33,468 --> 00:53:37,347
I feel bad for the guy. He's in a piece
of luggage, but he's got water.

682
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:40,225
- What did you want them to do?
- Get off the bus.

683
00:53:40,392 --> 00:53:42,727
And pick up the bag
with our friend in it.

684
00:53:42,894 --> 00:53:45,897
How many pro soccer teams
are fielding 50-year-old men?

685
00:53:46,064 --> 00:53:48,066
Rusty's not 50 years old.

686
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,404
Yeah, dude, we know Rusty's not 50.

687
00:53:53,113 --> 00:53:56,241
You think I'm 50 years old?
Let me ask you something.

688
00:53:56,408 --> 00:53:58,326
No, wait, let me ask you something.

689
00:53:58,493 --> 00:54:00,662
How old do you think I am?

690
00:54:00,829 --> 00:54:02,622
Forty-eight.

691
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:06,668
You think I'm 48 years old?

692
00:54:07,627 --> 00:54:09,879
Fifty-two?

693
00:54:14,718 --> 00:54:18,263
- Maybe he should've asked me.
- Nobody should ever ask you anything.

694
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:22,434
That guy doesn't have a hard enough
life right now? You gotta...

695
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,603
You're gonna defend him?
They put Yen in a handbag.

696
00:54:27,105 --> 00:54:30,525
- Can I ask you something? Ever notice...?
- If you're gonna ask a question...

697
00:54:30,692 --> 00:54:33,361
...give me time to respond,
unless it's rhetorical...

698
00:54:33,528 --> 00:54:35,822
...in which case the answer
is obvious: yes.

699
00:54:35,989 --> 00:54:37,407
- Okay, can I ask...?
- Yes.

700
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:41,619
- You ever notice that Tess looks exactly...
- Don't ever ask that. Seriously.

701
00:54:41,786 --> 00:54:45,123
- Not to anyone. Especially not to her.
- Wait. Why not?

702
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:47,125
Look.

703
00:54:47,292 --> 00:54:49,794
It's not in my nature to be mysterious...

704
00:54:49,961 --> 00:54:53,715
...but I can't talk about it,
and I can't talk about why.

705
00:55:00,513 --> 00:55:03,391
- Can I ask you...? Do I look 50 to you?
- Yeah.

706
00:55:03,558 --> 00:55:09,439
- Really?
- Well, I mean, only from the neck up.

707
00:56:05,036 --> 00:56:06,955
Saul?

708
00:56:07,539 --> 00:56:09,249
What's the matter?

709
00:56:10,417 --> 00:56:12,168
Nothing.

710
00:56:14,462 --> 00:56:16,798
You wanna go out? It's nice.

711
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:19,384
No.

712
00:56:20,218 --> 00:56:22,512
You wanna watch something?
The game's on.

713
00:56:22,679 --> 00:56:24,931
No.

714
00:56:25,098 --> 00:56:29,227
- You hungry? I'll heat something up.
- No.

715
00:56:30,395 --> 00:56:35,150
Saul, ever since you got back,
you've been acting strange.

716
00:56:35,984 --> 00:56:38,570
What did Danny want?

717
00:56:39,237 --> 00:56:40,739
Nothing.

718
00:56:40,905 --> 00:56:42,782
Nothing?

719
00:56:44,242 --> 00:56:45,910
How could he want nothing?

720
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:01,092
All right, the Night Fox has a name.
Francois Toulour.

721
00:57:01,259 --> 00:57:03,428
Baron Francois Toulour.

722
00:57:03,595 --> 00:57:06,890
Father was a French industrialist,
mother was Italian nobility.

723
00:57:07,057 --> 00:57:09,768
He never met her,
but he inherited her title.

724
00:57:09,934 --> 00:57:13,813
The bad news is he's rich, he's bored
and he's talented.

725
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:17,525
The really bad news is he was trained
by LeMarc.

726
00:57:17,692 --> 00:57:21,237
- This is not good.
- With the LeMarc? Gaspar LeMarc?

727
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:23,114
That's the one.

728
00:57:23,281 --> 00:57:25,367
- Well, we're doomed.
- We're not doomed.

729
00:57:25,533 --> 00:57:27,619
- He's one guy, and he's French.
- Yeah.

730
00:57:27,786 --> 00:57:30,288
Before we get too impressed by
his background...

731
00:57:30,455 --> 00:57:33,375
...let's hear what he's done.
- He started in the '90s.

732
00:57:33,541 --> 00:57:37,295
Bank of Geneva, the Danish Treasury,
the Bank of Italy, AMC Amro...

733
00:57:37,462 --> 00:57:40,507
...the Brussels Diamond Exchange,
Antwerp Diamond Exchange.

734
00:57:40,673 --> 00:57:44,135
- Wait, wait. All those in the 1990s?
- I'm only up to '96.

735
00:57:44,302 --> 00:57:46,930
- Seriously?
- In '97, he went through an art phase.

736
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:51,142
He hit the Tate in London, the Louvre
in Paris, twice, and the Prado.

737
00:57:51,309 --> 00:57:54,771
Wait. No, no, hang on. The Prado Museum
in '97? That was Moretti.

738
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:58,358
- Everybody knows that...
- He is Moretti. It's one of his aliases.

739
00:58:00,068 --> 00:58:02,320
Okay, I'll skip to my favorite.

740
00:58:02,487 --> 00:58:08,460
In 2002, he stole the king of Morocco's
200-foot yacht. Vanished into thin air.

741
00:58:08,827 --> 00:58:12,330
Crew surfaced days later in a life raft.
Couldn't remember a thing.

742
00:58:12,497 --> 00:58:16,292
- How do you hide a 200-foot yacht?
- If the king knows, he's not telling.

743
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:20,505
He got it back a month later. He now
plays tennis with Toulour every weekend.

744
00:58:20,672 --> 00:58:23,967
- We're in some serious trouble here.
- Copy that.

745
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:26,594
- So, what do we do?
- We respond.

746
00:58:26,761 --> 00:58:31,016
- Respond? How?
- In kind.

747
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:55,874
Mr. Ocean.

748
00:58:56,041 --> 00:58:59,544
You broke rule number one,
and that has consequences.

749
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,380
Oh, you must be talking about
the paintings.

750
00:59:02,547 --> 00:59:07,010
Don't worry. You'll be dead in five days,
and I'll get my paintings back.

751
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:10,889
- Unless you have an accident first.
- I don't think so, Daniel.

752
00:59:11,348 --> 00:59:14,392
Perhaps I should explain to you
why I'm tormenting you.

753
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,728
I'd like that.

754
00:59:16,895 --> 00:59:19,773
Last month I was in Portugal
to see my mentor.

755
00:59:19,939 --> 00:59:21,566
- LeMarc.
- Indeed.

756
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:27,530
A very loud and annoying American
businessman was there the same day.

757
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:31,117
He worked for a big insurance company.

758
00:59:31,284 --> 00:59:34,871
He's the one who suggested Benedict
to you as a potential mark.

759
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:37,332
- You know the man?
- What about him?

760
00:59:37,499 --> 00:59:40,627
He said it was the most beautiful job
he'd ever seen.

761
00:59:40,794 --> 00:59:44,255
He went on and on about this job,
and then he said...

762
00:59:44,422 --> 00:59:47,300
...it showed you were the greatest
thief in the world.

763
00:59:47,467 --> 00:59:51,471
But the worst part is that LeMarc
never corrected him.

764
00:59:55,684 --> 01:00:00,271
I told LeMarc that you can't be
better than me.

765
01:00:00,438 --> 01:00:04,526
And he answered that it was impossible
to know for sure.

766
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:10,615
So I thought about that for, like,
three weeks in a row, day and night.

767
01:00:10,782 --> 01:00:15,954
And then suddenly, I realized that
he was actually right.

768
01:00:16,121 --> 01:00:19,624
It is impossible to compare one theft
to the other.

769
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:26,323
So I guess the only way to know
who's the best of us for sure...

770
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:29,884
...is to go after the same object.
Do the same job.

771
01:00:30,051 --> 01:00:33,221
Don't you think that would be fun?

772
01:00:34,055 --> 01:00:38,852
You're being awfully cavalier with a lot of
people's lives so you can play out a game.

773
01:00:40,395 --> 01:00:42,480
You're gonna regret it.

774
01:00:43,189 --> 01:00:45,942
Come on, Mr. Ocean.

775
01:00:46,443 --> 01:00:50,321
How are you gonna possibly get
$97 million by next Wednesday?

776
01:00:50,488 --> 01:00:55,452
Especially if every safe you crack between
now and then is already empty?

777
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:57,912
Whereas if you accept my challenge
and win...

778
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:00,707
...I promise I'll pay your debt
to Benedict...

779
01:01:00,874 --> 01:01:04,669
...and LeMarc will hold my money
in escrow as a guarantee.

780
01:01:11,801 --> 01:01:13,845
What are we stealing?

781
01:01:15,805 --> 01:01:18,016
The famous Fabergì Coronation Egg.

782
01:01:18,183 --> 01:01:21,436
- Was that your idea or LeMarc's?
- I think he would agree...

783
01:01:21,603 --> 01:01:24,856
...that it's the most appropriate thing
for us to compete over.

784
01:01:25,023 --> 01:01:26,858
Where is it located?

785
01:01:27,025 --> 01:01:30,278
The egg left Paris this morning
on its way to Rome.

786
01:01:30,445 --> 01:01:34,991
It travels with heavy security and usually
with one or more replicas.

787
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:39,412
Sometimes they even show the replicas
without anybody knowing.

788
01:01:39,579 --> 01:01:42,457
When the egg goes on display
Monday morning...

789
01:01:42,624 --> 01:01:46,711
...you'll have 48 hours to steal it
before your deadline's up.

790
01:01:46,878 --> 01:01:50,090
When the deadline passes and you don't
have the egg...

791
01:01:50,256 --> 01:01:53,468
...LeMarc will know who's the best.

792
01:02:09,776 --> 01:02:12,737
- Rusty's phone.
- Who is this?

793
01:02:12,904 --> 01:02:15,156
Nicole. Who's this?

794
01:02:15,323 --> 01:02:18,159
Nagel. Where's Rusty?

795
01:02:18,326 --> 01:02:22,122
He said if you called,
to say he was at Gunther's.

796
01:02:22,288 --> 01:02:25,417
Gunther's? What's that about?
Did he say something?

797
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:27,085
Do you have a message?

798
01:02:27,252 --> 01:02:31,005
Yes, I do. Tell him this thing is gonna
cost him double what I told him.

799
01:02:31,172 --> 01:02:34,843
And tell him I had to go three times
as thin on the layers.

800
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:39,973
And tell him if he wants it tomorrow,
it should cost him more than double.

801
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:43,393
And tell him this thing is beautiful.

802
01:02:43,643 --> 01:02:46,563
Would fool the bloody Romanovs
themselves.

803
01:02:47,105 --> 01:02:51,776
And tell him I'm being a nice guy.
And tell him he dresses like a gigolo.

804
01:02:51,943 --> 01:02:53,778
Is that it?

805
01:02:53,945 --> 01:02:58,825
Yeah. No. Tell him having
a sexy female assistant...

806
01:02:58,992 --> 01:03:02,620
...is such a terrible cliché.

807
01:03:13,131 --> 01:03:15,800
Can I get a coffee or something?

808
01:03:16,634 --> 01:03:20,013
Thanks. Just a cappuccino or espresso.

809
01:03:22,974 --> 01:03:24,309
Well...

810
01:03:33,485 --> 01:03:36,237
You call me on Saturday and ask me
to come into my office...

811
01:03:36,404 --> 01:03:38,823
...and sign a 1077...

812
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:42,035
...and you can't even tell me
what they are after?

813
01:03:42,202 --> 01:03:45,455
- I can come to your house.
- I'm leaving for Naples in two hours.

814
01:03:45,622 --> 01:03:49,000
- We'll talk about this on Wednesday.
- It'll be gone by Wednesday.

815
01:03:49,167 --> 01:03:53,088
- What? What? What will be gone?
- Something worth signing a 1077 for.

816
01:03:53,254 --> 01:03:57,008
Ryan and his friends did the Bellagio
casino heist in 2001.

817
01:03:57,175 --> 01:04:00,178
- I am telling you, this is serious...
- If that's true...

818
01:04:00,345 --> 01:04:03,807
...then we should call the American FBl...
- No, no, no.

819
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:06,768
- Maurizio, listen to me.
- Agent Lahiri...

820
01:04:06,935 --> 01:04:10,355
...a 1077 is not a small thing.

821
01:04:10,522 --> 01:04:13,233
Unless you can tell me
what they are after...

822
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,527
...there is no point in discussing it.

823
01:05:00,905 --> 01:05:02,115
Hey...

824
01:05:05,410 --> 01:05:08,955
Because LeMarc stole it in 1980
when 23 others failed.

825
01:05:09,122 --> 01:05:13,626
Because the Night Fox is trying to prove
he's better than Ryan and his friends.

826
01:05:15,336 --> 01:05:19,424
This is ridiculous.
You say the egg will be stolen.

827
01:05:19,591 --> 01:05:23,845
Then you say LeMarc already stole it
24 years ago.

828
01:05:24,012 --> 01:05:27,265
- Which one is it?
- Both.

829
01:05:27,432 --> 01:05:29,267
What?

830
01:05:29,851 --> 01:05:32,395
LeMarc's wife made him
put the egg back.

831
01:05:36,983 --> 01:05:41,488
When I signed a 1077 for you
on the Bulgari case...

832
01:05:41,654 --> 01:05:47,627
...you requisitioned 30 of my men for
three months and made zero arrests.

833
01:05:51,915 --> 01:05:53,375
I won't do it again.

834
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,505
First, we cannot go at night.

835
01:05:58,671 --> 01:06:01,466
The laser grid in the Great Hall's
impossible to beat.

836
01:06:01,633 --> 01:06:04,302
- Nothing's impossible.
- This is impossible.

837
01:06:04,469 --> 01:06:07,514
It's in constant motion, programmed
to improvise randomly...

838
01:06:07,681 --> 01:06:09,849
...meaning we can't
plan our way through.

839
01:06:10,016 --> 01:06:11,267
All right.

840
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:12,769
So it's a daytime play.

841
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:18,024
We're still short three on the inside since
Isabel made you and Yen and Danny.

842
01:06:18,191 --> 01:06:20,485
We could try a Smuggler's Paradise.

843
01:06:20,652 --> 01:06:23,530
- It hasn't worked since the '50s.
- '54, actually.

844
01:06:23,697 --> 01:06:25,240
What's option two?

845
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:28,451
Baby Jane, Squeaky Wheel,
followed by a Number-Two Son.

846
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:32,455
It's complicated, but it's got a high
success rate. The only problem is...

847
01:06:32,622 --> 01:06:36,209
We can't do it without a grease man
on the inside, without Yen.

848
01:06:37,919 --> 01:06:41,423
We'll have to risk it.
We'll put him in disguise.

849
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:45,835
10:10, I leave the café,
proceed west. 10:11?

850
01:06:47,929 --> 01:06:50,515
- I enter the second-floor bathroom.
- 10:13?

851
01:06:50,682 --> 01:06:52,851
Approach the Spanish Steps
from the south.

852
01:06:53,018 --> 01:06:55,186
Basher and I enter by the main entrance.

853
01:06:55,353 --> 01:06:58,148
- 10:15?
- I help Yen into the ventilation duct.

854
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:00,692
- 10:18?
- I move Reuben to the Egg Room.

855
01:07:00,859 --> 01:07:03,737
- I pause in the Great Hall while...
- I go to the Egg Room.

856
01:07:03,903 --> 01:07:05,905
- 10:21?
- Yen enters the mainframe room.

857
01:07:06,072 --> 01:07:09,534
He cuts power to grid 14-A.
He radios me. I signal Linus.

858
01:07:09,701 --> 01:07:11,494
- I then go to the Egg Room.
- 10:22?

859
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:13,913
I drop my keys and move Reuben
to his mark.

860
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:17,042
- I blind camera one.
- I blind camera two.

861
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:19,252
- I blind camera three.
- I blind camera four.

862
01:07:19,419 --> 01:07:20,754
- I make the switch.
- Right.

863
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:24,424
- 10:24?
- I pull to the corner of the main entrance.

864
01:07:24,591 --> 01:07:27,260
I meet Danny at the Steps.
We head north. 10:25?

865
01:07:27,427 --> 01:07:28,803
Turk and I make the drop.

866
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:31,139
All right. Really good stuff, guys.

867
01:07:31,306 --> 01:07:35,310
Really good work. All right,
we'll pick it up here in an hour.

868
01:07:35,477 --> 01:07:37,437
It's a slam-dunk.

869
01:07:37,979 --> 01:07:40,523
- Great.
- 10:45, we all get arrested.

870
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,108
You bet.

871
01:07:42,275 --> 01:07:44,652
- How was Toulour?
- He was predictable.

872
01:07:44,819 --> 01:07:47,030
You hear from Nagel?

873
01:07:47,197 --> 01:07:48,615
He'll be here.

874
01:07:48,782 --> 01:07:51,159
That's a lot to presume
from a guy like Nagel.

875
01:07:51,326 --> 01:07:52,952
Follow it up.

876
01:08:00,168 --> 01:08:01,461
This is Isabel.

877
01:08:01,628 --> 01:08:05,215
It's Johan. I just set a 6:00 meeting
for you with an Andre Ciment...

878
01:08:05,382 --> 01:08:10,095
...who says he had four paintings stolen
from his house in Lake Como.

879
01:08:10,261 --> 01:08:12,263
- And when was this?
- Sometime Friday.

880
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:14,974
He's missing two Monets,
a Turner and a Degas.

881
01:08:15,141 --> 01:08:17,477
- Which Degas was it?
- Blue Dancers.

882
01:08:17,644 --> 01:08:22,315
Supposedly, there's surveillance video, but
I haven't been able to confirm that yet.

883
01:08:22,482 --> 01:08:24,859
It is all about error correction.

884
01:08:26,027 --> 01:08:29,823
Three thousand separate,
translucent, digital slivers...

885
01:08:29,989 --> 01:08:33,118
...instead of the 1000
I thought it would be.

886
01:08:33,284 --> 01:08:35,620
Thank God it doesn't have to move.

887
01:08:38,498 --> 01:08:42,794
Re-creating the lighting was a pain.
It's a mixture of tungsten and real light.

888
01:08:42,961 --> 01:08:46,006
But I think the color rendition
is pretty damn accurate.

889
01:08:46,172 --> 01:08:50,218
Batteries are in the base.
Two minutes maximum.

890
01:08:50,385 --> 01:08:52,012
You're good.

891
01:08:52,178 --> 01:08:55,181
- It's good, Roman. You're a genius.
- I think I am.

892
01:08:56,349 --> 01:08:59,144
You'd have never got past that grid.

893
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:01,187
That's why you're paying me double.

894
01:09:01,354 --> 01:09:03,481
- What? No, no, no.
- You got my message.

895
01:09:03,648 --> 01:09:07,152
- Who's that sexy phone voice? Early Bond.
- What message?

896
01:09:07,318 --> 01:09:10,321
The message I left with
Sexy Phone Voice Nicole.

897
01:09:10,488 --> 01:09:12,115
On your mobile.

898
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:15,410
Got something going
with Gunther? Am I in?

899
01:09:15,577 --> 01:09:19,831
- Okay, when did you leave the message?
- Two days ago.

900
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,125
She had your phone.

901
01:09:23,710 --> 01:09:25,545
- She has your...?
- Yeah.

902
01:09:28,089 --> 01:09:29,966
- That means that she's...?
- Yeah.

903
01:09:31,134 --> 01:09:33,011
- Well, you better...
- Yeah.

904
01:09:35,013 --> 01:09:36,514
- That's great.
- I mean...

905
01:09:36,681 --> 01:09:41,019
So...? So who's got my money?

906
01:09:43,563 --> 01:09:47,192
Who has got my bloody money?

907
01:10:07,796 --> 01:10:09,464
Jesus.

908
01:10:21,267 --> 01:10:23,520
Sorry to hear about your mom.

909
01:10:24,479 --> 01:10:26,606
She was an amazing...

910
01:10:27,565 --> 01:10:29,109
Well, I thought so, at least.

911
01:10:29,442 --> 01:10:32,946
She hated you. I should've
picked up on that.

912
01:10:33,113 --> 01:10:35,532
- She hated all thieves.
- No wonder you fought.

913
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:36,950
Excuse me?

914
01:10:37,117 --> 01:10:39,452
- May I have my phone back?
- No.

915
01:10:41,996 --> 01:10:45,041
- That's a nice pull, by the way.
- Thanks.

916
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:48,920
Did you get that tingling sensation
down your spine when you did it?

917
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:51,339
Or is that none of my business?

918
01:10:54,092 --> 01:10:56,302
You considered a career change?

919
01:10:56,469 --> 01:10:57,971
Have you?

920
01:11:00,974 --> 01:11:02,308
I tried hotels.

921
01:11:02,475 --> 01:11:03,893
I'm better at this.

922
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:10,567
Went by the café for some tiramisu.

923
01:11:10,734 --> 01:11:12,902
- It wasn't the same.
- Who's the Night Fox?

924
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:16,823
- They did something to the eggs.
- Why accept his challenge?

925
01:11:17,907 --> 01:11:19,492
Because he'll lose.

926
01:11:19,659 --> 01:11:21,202
And how can you beat him?

927
01:11:21,369 --> 01:11:22,746
We can't.

928
01:11:24,164 --> 01:11:25,999
You're not making any sense.

929
01:11:26,166 --> 01:11:27,709
Okay.

930
01:11:31,921 --> 01:11:36,343
The Bulgari job you pulled with Frank
when we were together...

931
01:11:37,761 --> 01:11:39,012
...I knew it was you.

932
01:11:42,474 --> 01:11:44,517
Why didn't you say something?

933
01:11:47,771 --> 01:11:49,564
Why didn't you...

934
01:11:50,065 --> 01:11:51,566
...Robert?

935
01:11:52,901 --> 01:11:54,861
I didn't want it to end.

936
01:11:58,198 --> 01:11:59,574
You assumed it would.

937
01:12:00,533 --> 01:12:02,327
Was I wrong?

938
01:12:04,454 --> 01:12:06,373
You shouldn't be here.

939
01:12:09,542 --> 01:12:11,127
I have a meeting.

940
01:12:11,294 --> 01:12:14,547
Someone stole a whole bunch
of paintings in Lake Como.

941
01:12:15,965 --> 01:12:18,927
Interesting. Any leads?

942
01:12:19,094 --> 01:12:20,470
The next time I see you...

943
01:12:21,388 --> 01:12:23,223
...I'm arresting you.

944
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:27,644
And Ocean and anybody else
I recognize.

945
01:12:28,728 --> 01:12:30,271
Fair enough.

946
01:13:27,495 --> 01:13:29,831
- Ready?
- Right.

947
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:48,683
Yes, of course I do.

948
01:13:48,850 --> 01:13:51,102
My Blue Dancers, my Degas.

949
01:13:51,269 --> 01:13:54,064
They took it, unfortunately,
and I really would like...

950
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:56,107
Do you have any enemies?

951
01:13:56,274 --> 01:13:59,361
Anybody out there who would
feel wronged by you?

952
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:05,408
No. I can't see anyone.

953
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:08,161
But why? You think...
You think maybe the thief...

954
01:14:08,328 --> 01:14:10,372
...is trying to harm me personally now?

955
01:14:10,538 --> 01:14:13,333
Well, I assumed he was after
the paintings themselves.

956
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,751
I think it's enough.

957
01:14:14,918 --> 01:14:16,127
Ready?

958
01:14:24,594 --> 01:14:26,054
Good?

959
01:14:28,306 --> 01:14:30,850
I have something you might be
interested in.

960
01:14:31,017 --> 01:14:36,356
It's a DVD with all the hidden
surveillance cameras I have to my place.

961
01:14:36,523 --> 01:14:39,275
It's plenty. I haven't
checked it out yet.

962
01:14:39,442 --> 01:14:42,737
Maybe the thieves have been careless
enough to be photographed.

963
01:14:42,904 --> 01:14:46,032
I doubt it, this level of thief,
but I'll take a look.

964
01:14:46,199 --> 01:14:47,450
Yeah. You never know.

965
01:14:47,701 --> 01:14:49,536
Okay. Well, merci.

966
01:14:51,329 --> 01:14:54,040
Thank you, Mademoiselle Lahiri,
for everything.

967
01:14:54,207 --> 01:14:56,710
Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye.

968
01:14:57,877 --> 01:14:59,546
Mademoiselle Lahiri.

969
01:14:59,838 --> 01:15:03,466
Did you get the faxed copy
of the 1077? Good.

970
01:15:03,633 --> 01:15:08,388
Here's what I need:
A dozen... Twelve uniformed officers.

971
01:15:08,555 --> 01:15:12,475
Metal detectors, extra cameras.

972
01:15:12,642 --> 01:15:16,396
So I'll e-mail you the photographs.
Do you happen to have a pen?

973
01:15:16,563 --> 01:15:19,232
I'll just give you the names. Okay.

974
01:15:19,399 --> 01:15:23,945
Livingston Dell, male, Caucasian,
5'6", 150 pounds.

975
01:15:24,112 --> 01:15:28,742
Virgil Malloy, male, Caucasian,
5' 10", 160 pounds.

976
01:15:28,908 --> 01:15:31,536
Robert Ryan, male, Caucasian...

977
01:15:38,418 --> 01:15:40,795
- Hello?
- Buon giorno, Mr. Eisenhower.

978
01:15:40,962 --> 01:15:43,131
This is your 5 a.m. wake-up call.

979
01:15:43,298 --> 01:15:45,592
- Really?
- Yes, I'm afraid.

980
01:15:45,759 --> 01:15:47,761
Have a nice day, sir.

981
01:15:58,188 --> 01:16:00,899
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

982
01:16:01,066 --> 01:16:06,196
- What...? Sleeping. Why are you dressed?
- It's 5:30, day of. We gotta go. Let's go.

983
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:09,074
It's 11:30.

984
01:16:10,950 --> 01:16:12,869
The night before.

985
01:16:16,331 --> 01:16:17,624
But...

986
01:16:23,546 --> 01:16:25,632
Oh, he's mean.
He's just mean-spirited.

987
01:16:25,799 --> 01:16:27,842
- How many espressos did you have?
- Five.

988
01:16:28,009 --> 01:16:29,678
Yeah, come on.

989
01:16:39,562 --> 01:16:41,564
I don't know if she's just confused...

990
01:16:41,731 --> 01:16:44,567
...or she's really turned the corner
and hates me now.

991
01:16:46,111 --> 01:16:48,405
You think I handled this wrong?

992
01:16:48,988 --> 01:16:51,408
I was too forceful.
I was too American.

993
01:16:51,574 --> 01:16:53,326
She's different.

994
01:16:54,619 --> 01:16:57,455
Maybe you're right,
maybe she has moved on.

995
01:16:59,582 --> 01:17:03,086
You know, I talked to a doctor
about getting that tattoo removed.

996
01:17:07,716 --> 01:17:11,761
But given its location,
he advised against it.

997
01:17:16,808 --> 01:17:19,769
That guy doing Potsie is unbelievable.

998
01:20:23,953 --> 01:20:25,372
I mean, what's this guy's problem?

999
01:20:25,872 --> 01:20:30,251
He's stitched us up twice in two weeks,
all over his ego.

1000
01:20:30,418 --> 01:20:33,588
It's the first decent evening we've
had together in I don't know how long.

1001
01:20:33,755 --> 01:20:36,633
All right, all right,
let's just stay on point here.

1002
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,551
Let's go over the list again.

1003
01:20:38,718 --> 01:20:41,096
Who died and made you Danny?

1004
01:20:44,808 --> 01:20:46,685
No one.

1005
01:20:46,851 --> 01:20:49,312
I'm sorry. My emotions
are all over the place.

1006
01:20:49,479 --> 01:20:51,981
I was forceful, trying
to show good leadership...

1007
01:20:52,148 --> 01:20:54,317
- For fuck's sake. Let's go.
- You're a good leader.

1008
01:20:54,484 --> 01:20:55,860
Thanks.

1009
01:20:56,236 --> 01:20:58,697
All right, well, let's go
over the list again.

1010
01:20:58,863 --> 01:21:00,448
- Swinging Priest?
- Not enough people.

1011
01:21:00,615 --> 01:21:02,075
- Crazy Larry?
- Not enough people.

1012
01:21:02,242 --> 01:21:04,077
- Soft Shoulder?
- Not enough people.

1013
01:21:04,244 --> 01:21:06,746
- Baker's Dozen?
- No woman and not enough people.

1014
01:21:06,913 --> 01:21:08,289
Hell in a Handbasket?

1015
01:21:08,456 --> 01:21:12,877
We can't train a cat that quickly.
And not enough people.

1016
01:21:15,046 --> 01:21:17,674
- What about Tess?
- What about her?

1017
01:21:17,841 --> 01:21:20,093
Well, you know how she
kind of looks like...

1018
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:22,137
- So what?
- Yeah, what's your point?

1019
01:21:22,303 --> 01:21:24,264
So we do a Lookie-loo.

1020
01:21:25,056 --> 01:21:28,893
- It's a Lookie-loo with a Bundle of Joy.
- A Lookie-loo with Tess...

1021
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:30,395
...and a Bundle of Joy?

1022
01:21:30,562 --> 01:21:33,314
You've gone right out of your tree,
my son. He's mad.

1023
01:21:33,481 --> 01:21:36,901
It's crazy. It's Italian-television crazy,
and we're still one short.

1024
01:21:37,068 --> 01:21:39,404
Think about it.
She can get near the egg...

1025
01:21:39,571 --> 01:21:42,198
...during daylight
with half the system down.

1026
01:21:42,365 --> 01:21:44,284
I mean, that's a trifecta.

1027
01:21:48,788 --> 01:21:51,750
He might be right. Make the calls.

1028
01:21:55,295 --> 01:21:58,131
Linus Caldwell, you are not
following the procedures...

1029
01:21:58,298 --> 01:22:01,051
...Danny talked about
if Terry Benedict shows up.

1030
01:22:01,217 --> 01:22:03,011
Something is wrong. What is wrong?

1031
01:22:03,178 --> 01:22:04,804
Danny's fine. He's with Rusty.

1032
01:22:04,971 --> 01:22:08,141
During this part of the plan,
they can't communicate with us.

1033
01:22:08,308 --> 01:22:09,768
Promise he isn't hurt.

1034
01:22:09,934 --> 01:22:12,187
I promise he isn't hurt.

1035
01:22:13,146 --> 01:22:14,814
You're gonna miss the deadline.

1036
01:22:14,981 --> 01:22:18,693
Danny would be thrilled if you met him
in Rome when the job's finished.

1037
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:20,320
He misses you like crazy.

1038
01:22:20,487 --> 01:22:23,448
Plus, you studied art, so I know
how much you love Rome.

1039
01:22:23,615 --> 01:22:25,867
There's no downside here.

1040
01:22:27,327 --> 01:22:29,954
Wow, they're bringing you
along fast, aren't they?

1041
01:22:30,121 --> 01:22:32,165
Yes. Danny would be more thrilled...

1042
01:22:32,332 --> 01:22:36,586
...if you were on the 7 p.m. out of JFK,
which means you have to leave right now.

1043
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:08,618
I thought I'd requested a midsize.

1044
01:23:08,785 --> 01:23:12,038
- Danny here?
- He wanted to be.

1045
01:23:18,169 --> 01:23:22,424
Did you have a nice flight? We weren't
sure if you were a window or aisle person.

1046
01:23:22,590 --> 01:23:25,969
- How long's Danny been in jail?
- Just a couple of days, really.

1047
01:23:26,136 --> 01:23:30,807
Which, you know, on the bright side,
he's completely safe from Benedict.

1048
01:23:30,974 --> 01:23:33,685
He told me everything was fine.
He lied right to me.

1049
01:23:33,852 --> 01:23:37,605
What I think he meant by "fine"
is we're running low on time and money...

1050
01:23:37,772 --> 01:23:40,859
...and we're deeper in debt
than when we started.

1051
01:23:41,026 --> 01:23:43,653
I assume that you have a plan
to get him out.

1052
01:23:43,820 --> 01:23:47,240
- Actually, she sounds like her.
- No, she needs a Southern accent.

1053
01:23:47,407 --> 01:23:50,952
- Can you do a Southern...?
- What the hell is going on with you guys?

1054
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:54,748
Not quite. The accent is crucial.
It's the first thing people notice.

1055
01:23:54,914 --> 01:23:57,876
- This ridiculous car, what is it doing?
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1056
01:23:58,043 --> 01:24:03,715
All right, I'm just gonna level with you.
Due to certain personnel losses...

1057
01:24:03,882 --> 01:24:06,134
...that we have sustained...

1058
01:24:06,885 --> 01:24:09,387
...we're... Various readjustments
had to be made.

1059
01:24:09,554 --> 01:24:12,349
You're gonna have to play a small role
in this thing.

1060
01:24:12,515 --> 01:24:14,392
Okay? So can you put these on?

1061
01:24:15,518 --> 01:24:18,646
I'd like you to put this hat on.

1062
01:24:18,813 --> 01:24:22,317
You're gonna put on that,
and you're gonna stuff it with that.

1063
01:24:22,484 --> 01:24:27,155
And we'll turn around,
just give you a little moment.

1064
01:24:27,322 --> 01:24:29,157
Small role.

1065
01:24:29,324 --> 01:24:31,368
Who am I supposed to be?

1066
01:24:32,577 --> 01:24:33,870
Well...

1067
01:24:36,247 --> 01:24:37,624
Oh, really?

1068
01:24:37,791 --> 01:24:40,126
Well, absolutely.

1069
01:24:41,211 --> 01:24:45,423
I can have... We can make
the suite available.

1070
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:47,384
No, no, no trouble at all.

1071
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:52,013
I mean, we would love... We are honored
that she would think of us again.

1072
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:53,807
Okay.

1073
01:24:53,973 --> 01:24:55,392
Okay. Thank you.

1074
01:24:55,558 --> 01:24:57,435
Bye.

1075
01:25:07,237 --> 01:25:09,781
How is this going to get Danny out?

1076
01:25:09,948 --> 01:25:13,159
- We needed someone famous.
- Why didn't you get someone famous?

1077
01:25:13,326 --> 01:25:15,995
Just think Four Weddings and a Funeral.

1078
01:25:16,162 --> 01:25:18,331
She wasn't in
Four Weddings and a Funeral.

1079
01:25:18,498 --> 01:25:21,501
"I. " "I wasn't in
Four Weddings and a Funeral. "

1080
01:25:21,668 --> 01:25:23,670
Just protect your fake baby.

1081
01:25:25,839 --> 01:25:27,090
I'm hyperventilating.

1082
01:25:27,257 --> 01:25:30,510
- Welcome back, Signora Roberts.
- Thank you. She's very tired.

1083
01:25:32,137 --> 01:25:33,722
- Take it. Take it.
- Okay.

1084
01:25:35,557 --> 01:25:38,309
Oh, let's hide. Let's hide.

1085
01:25:39,894 --> 01:25:41,479
Julia?

1086
01:25:41,646 --> 01:25:44,024
My name is Teresa.

1087
01:25:49,362 --> 01:25:52,157
I thought I saw a friend of mine,
someone that I know.

1088
01:25:52,323 --> 01:25:55,994
No, absolutely not. You can't turn off
the pressure sensors. No.

1089
01:25:57,370 --> 01:25:58,705
Well, she can't touch it.

1090
01:25:58,872 --> 01:26:02,042
She's a movie star.
She's not the pope, for Christ sake.

1091
01:26:02,375 --> 01:26:05,045
You're from Smyrna, Georgia.
You were born in 1967.

1092
01:26:05,211 --> 01:26:08,298
- You like croquet and knitting.
- Your middle name is Fiona.

1093
01:26:08,465 --> 01:26:10,300
You've got 10 dogs, seven horses.

1094
01:26:10,467 --> 01:26:14,054
- Your favorite color is peach.
- She doesn't have more horses than dogs.

1095
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:16,931
- I can't do this. I can't.
- Tess, we're out of time.

1096
01:26:17,098 --> 01:26:18,350
- "Julia," please.
- Julia.

1097
01:26:18,516 --> 01:26:22,145
No, we understand you're feeling
insecure. That is totally natural.

1098
01:26:22,312 --> 01:26:24,439
You're playing an actress.
They're insecure.

1099
01:26:24,606 --> 01:26:26,900
No, I'm not insecure. I'm freaking out.

1100
01:26:27,067 --> 01:26:28,651
- Yes. That's right.
- Brilliant!

1101
01:26:28,818 --> 01:26:30,070
You're playing a role.

1102
01:26:30,236 --> 01:26:33,573
No, you're playing a role.
I'm apparently playing a real person.

1103
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:37,827
- Yeah, so?
- It's just wrong.

1104
01:26:40,955 --> 01:26:43,917
You mean, like, morally?

1105
01:26:44,084 --> 01:26:46,461
No. Well, yes.

1106
01:26:46,836 --> 01:26:50,507
Probably... It's not the point.
The point is you want me to speak...

1107
01:26:50,674 --> 01:26:53,468
...for someone who's out there
somewhere. It's too personal.

1108
01:26:53,635 --> 01:26:56,179
More personal than your husband
doing 25-to-life?

1109
01:26:56,346 --> 01:26:59,808
He won't do 25-to-life. Benedict will
have him killed immediately.

1110
01:26:59,974 --> 01:27:01,935
- Don't.
- I'm sorry, that was stupid.

1111
01:27:02,102 --> 01:27:06,147
We're gonna be in and out in 10 minutes.
We have to. That's our time frame.

1112
01:27:06,314 --> 01:27:10,110
You don't even have to talk. Give them
a big smile, wave at the cameras.

1113
01:27:10,276 --> 01:27:13,279
- That's all she ever does.
- But if you do say something...

1114
01:27:13,446 --> 01:27:17,283
...don't forget your accent.
Drop your G's, and longer vowels.

1115
01:27:17,450 --> 01:27:18,952
Room service.

1116
01:27:19,119 --> 01:27:21,788
It's gonna be fine.
You've gotta remember something.

1117
01:27:21,955 --> 01:27:25,000
You are an image to these people.
You're like an object.

1118
01:27:25,166 --> 01:27:29,337
Nobody actually knows you.
The last thing this is gonna be is personal.

1119
01:27:34,259 --> 01:27:36,469
- Aren't you overdue?
- Why are you in Rome?

1120
01:27:36,636 --> 01:27:39,597
- I'm here on vacation.
- I love you.

1121
01:27:39,931 --> 01:27:42,767
You are not supposed to fly
eight months pregnant.

1122
01:27:42,934 --> 01:27:44,144
- I know.
- Is Danny here?

1123
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:45,937
- Of course.
- Danny.

1124
01:27:46,104 --> 01:27:48,189
- No, no, I mean, he has...
- He's working?

1125
01:27:48,356 --> 01:27:51,067
- Yes. Yes and no. He's working.
- In Rome?

1126
01:27:51,234 --> 01:27:53,653
- Bruce. Glen Snackwell, publicity.
- Hey, Glen.

1127
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:55,113
- I'm a big fan.
- Thanks.

1128
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,865
Great. You fired Marcy?

1129
01:27:57,032 --> 01:28:00,618
You fired Marcy. Two weeks ago,
you told me I should go with Marcy.

1130
01:28:00,785 --> 01:28:03,663
- I'm sorry.
- Tell him what happened with Marcy.

1131
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:06,166
- There's a story?
- Always a story with Marcy.

1132
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:08,793
- Marcy... Marcy...
- You look fantastic.

1133
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:11,129
- Such a surprise.
- You should sit down.

1134
01:28:11,296 --> 01:28:14,424
I'm with the studio. Marcy's still
very much in the picture.

1135
01:28:14,924 --> 01:28:16,968
I just wanted to get you for a second.

1136
01:28:17,510 --> 01:28:20,347
We're looking to come off
this baby thing strong.

1137
01:28:20,513 --> 01:28:24,684
You know, that little statue on the mantle
starts smirking at you after a while.

1138
01:28:24,851 --> 01:28:26,478
You know what I'm saying?

1139
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:30,648
- Not really, Glen, no.
- Sorry. Yeah.

1140
01:28:30,815 --> 01:28:32,609
Hey, Jules, that reminds me.

1141
01:28:32,776 --> 01:28:36,196
I've been meaning to call you since
the girls and I were in Taos.

1142
01:28:36,363 --> 01:28:40,700
- It's so good to see you.
- Come here. These are a mess.

1143
01:28:40,867 --> 01:28:44,162
Anyway, Tallulah left her
SpongeBob blanket in the red casita.

1144
01:28:44,329 --> 01:28:46,247
- Okay.
- So, what I wanna do... Here.

1145
01:28:46,414 --> 01:28:47,874
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1146
01:28:48,166 --> 01:28:50,377
- Thanks, Bruce.
- Is call Marcus...

1147
01:28:50,543 --> 01:28:55,215
...and have him get ahold of Louise
so we can make arrangements to get it.

1148
01:28:55,382 --> 01:28:57,258
He's home now, right?

1149
01:28:58,551 --> 01:29:00,720
- Marcus...
- I need to talk to Marcus.

1150
01:29:00,887 --> 01:29:04,683
- That's so funny. What a coincidence.
- Go ahead. Talk to him.

1151
01:29:04,849 --> 01:29:06,935
Over by the window, with the reception.

1152
01:29:07,102 --> 01:29:09,938
- Hello?
- Hello, Marcus?

1153
01:29:10,397 --> 01:29:13,233
No, it's Julia. Who's this?

1154
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,944
It's Julia. I'm with Bruce Willis.

1155
01:29:16,111 --> 01:29:17,779
You're with Bruce right now?

1156
01:29:17,946 --> 01:29:20,699
Can I speak with him?
Oh, yes, Tallulah's SpongeBob.

1157
01:29:20,865 --> 01:29:23,910
- I'm sorry, can I talk to him for a sec?
- Did it drop out?

1158
01:29:24,244 --> 01:29:27,580
- Yes, it fell out.
- That's been happening all week.

1159
01:29:27,747 --> 01:29:31,042
- Put that phone away right now.
- What?

1160
01:29:31,209 --> 01:29:32,836
Hang it up and put it away.

1161
01:29:33,253 --> 01:29:35,755
Do you have any idea how vulnerable...

1162
01:29:35,922 --> 01:29:41,177
...a fetus' brain is to the electromagnetic
field created by your cell phone?

1163
01:29:41,344 --> 01:29:44,347
You might as well point a gun
at her stomach.

1164
01:29:44,514 --> 01:29:47,267
- I'm Bruce Willis.
- Simon Leopold.

1165
01:29:47,434 --> 01:29:49,978
- I am Julia's physician.
- He's a doctor.

1166
01:29:50,145 --> 01:29:52,397
What happened to Dr. Webber?

1167
01:29:53,857 --> 01:29:56,735
- You know, Doc...? He was sick.
- Dr. Webber is on vacation.

1168
01:29:56,901 --> 01:29:59,029
- Well, he's sick.
- He's sick on vacation.

1169
01:29:59,195 --> 01:30:02,615
- Sick on vacation.
- Don't you hate that? Sick on vacation.

1170
01:30:02,782 --> 01:30:06,494
Sorry to have jumped on you, Mr. Willis.
You do very good actings.

1171
01:30:06,661 --> 01:30:07,912
Thank you.

1172
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:09,456
- Snackbar.
- Snackwell.

1173
01:30:09,622 --> 01:30:14,794
It doesn't matter. If we are to get there
at 4:00 and do that...

1174
01:30:14,961 --> 01:30:17,005
- I say 50-50.
- Closer than that.

1175
01:30:17,172 --> 01:30:21,634
- 2-1 they don't make it to the museum.
- 5-1 they don't make it to the Egg Room.

1176
01:30:22,469 --> 01:30:23,678
What?

1177
01:30:26,264 --> 01:30:28,933
- She's still my wife.
- She's a novice. You said so.

1178
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:31,478
- Led by an apprentice.
- Being tracked by a pro.

1179
01:30:31,811 --> 01:30:33,438
You want her to win.

1180
01:30:33,605 --> 01:30:35,231
- Which her?
- You know which her.

1181
01:30:35,398 --> 01:30:37,400
- The one that started all this.
- Right.

1182
01:30:37,567 --> 01:30:40,362
- Good. For a minute...
- Why would I say that? It's not her fault.

1183
01:30:40,528 --> 01:30:41,988
- It wasn't.
- Okay, then.

1184
01:30:42,155 --> 01:30:43,406
- Good.
- Good.

1185
01:30:43,573 --> 01:30:46,534
- I'm confused.
- Yeah, who are you talking about?

1186
01:30:46,701 --> 01:30:48,495
- Isabel.
- Tess.

1187
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:53,208
- I loved it, but I figured it out.
- Not a lot of people did.

1188
01:30:53,375 --> 01:30:55,627
- That's amazing.
- The second she doesn't...

1189
01:30:55,794 --> 01:30:58,004
...talk to you in the restaurant, I knew...

1190
01:30:58,171 --> 01:30:59,422
You figured that out.

1191
01:30:59,589 --> 01:31:02,634
- Yeah, the movie still works for me.
- Great.

1192
01:31:03,134 --> 01:31:06,638
Can we just...? Does she really need to be
rushing this quickly?

1193
01:31:06,805 --> 01:31:09,140
- She's practically jogging.
- In Thailand...

1194
01:31:09,307 --> 01:31:13,645
...mothers routinely give birth in rice
paddies and then go right back to work.

1195
01:31:13,812 --> 01:31:16,272
- Amazing women over there.
- Rice paddy?

1196
01:31:16,439 --> 01:31:19,859
She will not have it in a rice paddy.
She'll be at her own paddy.

1197
01:31:20,026 --> 01:31:23,238
And she will be very comfortable
because she will be strong...

1198
01:31:23,405 --> 01:31:26,032
...from this walk and this exercise.

1199
01:32:02,819 --> 01:32:04,612
Was she worth it?

1200
01:32:05,655 --> 01:32:07,365
Was Tess?

1201
01:32:10,702 --> 01:32:14,831
The moment that she doesn't talk to you
in the restaurant, I knew.

1202
01:32:15,123 --> 01:32:16,958
- Your friends didn't tell you?
- No.

1203
01:32:17,125 --> 01:32:19,419
- That's when you figured it out, huh?
- Yeah.

1204
01:32:19,586 --> 01:32:23,506
- But the movie was still enjoyable for me.
- Okay. Thanks.

1205
01:32:25,008 --> 01:32:29,596
If everybody's so smart, how come
the movie did $675 million worldwide...

1206
01:32:31,765 --> 01:32:33,475
...theatrical.

1207
01:32:33,641 --> 01:32:35,018
Julia. Doctor.

1208
01:32:35,185 --> 01:32:38,563
Doctor, you might wanna
call the rice paddy now.

1209
01:32:40,315 --> 01:32:45,111
Seal off the museum. Nobody in or out.

1210
01:32:46,112 --> 01:32:48,907
- Bring... Bring it, bring it.
- Quickly, quickly.

1211
01:32:49,074 --> 01:32:51,868
- Sit her down. Sit her down.
- Everybody just relax.

1212
01:32:52,285 --> 01:32:55,872
- Can you hear me? Talk to me.
- She is fine. She is fine.

1213
01:32:56,039 --> 01:32:59,459
She's good? Okay, that's it.
We're done here. No more pictures.

1214
01:32:59,626 --> 01:33:01,920
- Thank you, Bruce Willis.
- Just don't worry.

1215
01:33:02,087 --> 01:33:06,132
- Thank you, museum. We are code four.
- Walk slowly, like you're doing.

1216
01:33:06,299 --> 01:33:09,761
We'll get you into the car
as fast as we can.

1217
01:33:14,015 --> 01:33:16,184
Okay, we're not stopping. Don't stop.

1218
01:33:16,351 --> 01:33:18,019
- Hello.
- We're on our way out.

1219
01:33:18,186 --> 01:33:22,232
Isabel Lahiri, I'm with the museum.
It is so great to meet you.

1220
01:33:22,399 --> 01:33:25,068
- We're very late.
- I'm sorry, this won't take long.

1221
01:33:25,235 --> 01:33:29,656
I don't wanna be an annoying fan,
but my boyfriend is such a huge fan.

1222
01:33:29,823 --> 01:33:33,034
I can't let you leave unless you
sign something for him. Do you mind?

1223
01:33:33,201 --> 01:33:36,079
- That's very unorthodox.
- Sorry, it won't take long.

1224
01:33:36,246 --> 01:33:38,456
- What's his name?
- His name's Robert.

1225
01:33:38,623 --> 01:33:41,042
Aren't you a lefty?
I thought you were a lefty.

1226
01:33:41,209 --> 01:33:43,336
She is a lefty.

1227
01:33:43,503 --> 01:33:45,672
Often pregnant women
become ambidextrous.

1228
01:33:45,839 --> 01:33:48,174
You are a big fan.

1229
01:33:48,341 --> 01:33:51,052
She doesn't necessarily
have to sign lefty.

1230
01:33:51,469 --> 01:33:54,014
Oh, thanks so much. This is great.

1231
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:55,682
Okay. We're on the move.

1232
01:33:55,849 --> 01:33:58,143
Thank you. You take care, now.

1233
01:33:58,309 --> 01:34:01,062
And one more thing.
I just got off the phone...

1234
01:34:01,229 --> 01:34:06,484
...with someone called Marcy who put you
on a plane from New Mexico to L. A...

1235
01:34:06,651 --> 01:34:12,407
...where you have a 1:00 meeting
about a film, Clowns Can't Sleep.

1236
01:34:12,574 --> 01:34:16,786
Anyway, she just wanted me to let you
know everyone's running a little late...

1237
01:34:16,953 --> 01:34:20,749
...and was wondering if you could
make it at 1:30 instead.

1238
01:34:20,915 --> 01:34:22,959
I knew it.

1239
01:34:23,126 --> 01:34:25,128
Shame on you.

1240
01:34:26,296 --> 01:34:28,006
I don't think we've met. Bruce.

1241
01:34:28,173 --> 01:34:30,508
Isabel Lahiri. Nice to meet you.

1242
01:34:30,842 --> 01:34:32,469
Do you really have a boyfriend?

1243
01:34:32,635 --> 01:34:36,639
Or were you just...? Was that just
part of the whole thing with them?

1244
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:16,805
So how'd it go?

1245
01:35:49,295 --> 01:35:51,214
You Lahiri?

1246
01:35:52,215 --> 01:35:54,634
I'm Section Chief Molly Starr.

1247
01:35:54,801 --> 01:35:58,888
I spoke to a very nice man at Europol
this morning, Commissioner Greisman.

1248
01:35:59,055 --> 01:36:01,850
He wants you on the next flight
to Amsterdam.

1249
01:36:02,017 --> 01:36:05,145
There seems to be some irregularity
with your paperwork.

1250
01:36:39,596 --> 01:36:41,348
That one.

1251
01:36:41,514 --> 01:36:43,683
Let's start with that one.

1252
01:36:45,185 --> 01:36:48,146
Imagine yourself in a room...

1253
01:36:48,313 --> 01:36:53,360
...that's too short for you to stand up in
and not wide enough to lie down in.

1254
01:36:53,526 --> 01:36:56,696
A room with no light, no heat...

1255
01:36:56,863 --> 01:37:00,658
...and stone walls scratched by the teeth
and nails of desperate men...

1256
01:37:00,825 --> 01:37:03,495
...men driven crazy by isolation.

1257
01:37:04,621 --> 01:37:07,332
You will have rats for company...

1258
01:37:07,499 --> 01:37:11,795
...and a small window that looks out
on the world that has passed you by.

1259
01:37:12,337 --> 01:37:17,342
Your parents will grow old and die,
just like your dreams.

1260
01:37:17,676 --> 01:37:21,262
Your friends will forget your name,
tell your stories as their own...

1261
01:37:21,429 --> 01:37:25,266
...because what good is a story when
the person who owns it has vanished?

1262
01:37:25,433 --> 01:37:27,977
- What do you want?
- Testify against the others...

1263
01:37:28,144 --> 01:37:30,105
...in the Benedict case.

1264
01:37:30,271 --> 01:37:32,190
The Italian charges will be dropped.

1265
01:37:32,357 --> 01:37:35,902
You and the others will be extradited
to the U.S. this afternoon.

1266
01:37:36,695 --> 01:37:40,073
Plead, and you walk with parole.

1267
01:37:41,991 --> 01:37:43,576
I can't.

1268
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:55,463
Think about it, Linus.

1269
01:37:56,673 --> 01:38:00,010
For a moment there,
I was already forgetting your name.

1270
01:38:03,179 --> 01:38:04,556
Wait.

1271
01:38:09,102 --> 01:38:11,396
Just hang on a sec.

1272
01:39:22,676 --> 01:39:24,344
Linus.

1273
01:39:25,762 --> 01:39:28,181
Right. Thanks.

1274
01:39:29,057 --> 01:39:31,059
You okay?

1275
01:39:31,851 --> 01:39:34,854
- Well, I blew the meet with Matsui.
- Matsui?

1276
01:39:35,188 --> 01:39:38,525
Let me guess. He pulled
a Lost in Translation on you.

1277
01:39:41,444 --> 01:39:43,988
That's his idea of fun for first-timers.

1278
01:39:44,155 --> 01:39:48,368
- I mean... How do I not see these things?
- Don't get down on yourself.

1279
01:39:48,535 --> 01:39:50,245
- Obvious.
- We talked about this.

1280
01:39:50,412 --> 01:39:55,250
I hope Danny and Rusty appreciate the job
you did in a tight jam. I am proud of you.

1281
01:39:55,417 --> 01:39:57,627
- Thanks.
- We both are.

1282
01:39:58,795 --> 01:40:01,381
- You...? You told Dad?
- I had to, sweetheart.

1283
01:40:01,548 --> 01:40:03,633
- You told Dad?
- We were on vacation.

1284
01:40:03,925 --> 01:40:05,552
I'm sorry.

1285
01:40:05,719 --> 01:40:09,472
Great. Thanks. You're gonna be
dining out on this one for months.

1286
01:40:09,639 --> 01:40:12,976
"Hey, remember the time your mom
had to come to Rome... "

1287
01:40:13,643 --> 01:40:15,020
I'm sorry.

1288
01:40:15,186 --> 01:40:17,355
Every time with him. It's like...

1289
01:40:17,856 --> 01:40:21,109
It's like a...
It's like a...

1290
01:40:21,985 --> 01:40:25,363
That was for keeping me in the dark.
And that... That...

1291
01:40:25,530 --> 01:40:27,741
...is for making me a master thief.

1292
01:40:27,907 --> 01:40:30,035
- And that...
- Okay.

1293
01:40:30,201 --> 01:40:33,538
...is for ruining our
second third anniversary.

1294
01:40:33,705 --> 01:40:37,667
Okay. Okay? Come here.

1295
01:40:44,424 --> 01:40:46,843
I'm sorry I kept you in the dark.

1296
01:40:49,596 --> 01:40:51,765
I'm sorry that I made you a thief.

1297
01:40:51,931 --> 01:40:54,684
- Master.
- Master thief.

1298
01:41:01,483 --> 01:41:07,431
And I'm very sorry that I ruined
our second third anniversary.

1299
01:41:08,948 --> 01:41:12,369
- Okay?
- Okay.

1300
01:41:13,703 --> 01:41:15,872
You forgive me?

1301
01:41:16,039 --> 01:41:18,875
- A little.
- All right.

1302
01:41:19,042 --> 01:41:20,960
What was Bruce Willis like? Was he...?

1303
01:41:29,302 --> 01:41:33,223
Follow it. That's Ryan's car.
Follow that one.

1304
01:41:57,789 --> 01:42:00,083
Hey, wait, wait!

1305
01:42:00,667 --> 01:42:03,086
What the hell is going on?

1306
01:42:03,837 --> 01:42:06,423
Your father's alive, Izzy.

1307
01:42:08,466 --> 01:42:09,676
Your mom lied to you...

1308
01:42:09,843 --> 01:42:13,430
...to keep you from him. He's alive.
- What are you talking about?

1309
01:42:13,596 --> 01:42:17,600
When they divorced, she told him if he
contacted you she'd go to the cops...

1310
01:42:17,767 --> 01:42:19,894
...with everything to put him in jail.

1311
01:42:20,061 --> 01:42:22,022
How do you know that?

1312
01:42:22,188 --> 01:42:25,442
And why should I believe you?
I don't believe you, okay?

1313
01:42:35,452 --> 01:42:37,370
You know where he is?

1314
01:42:37,537 --> 01:42:39,622
I know somebody who does.

1315
01:42:46,921 --> 01:42:50,467
There's nothing back there
but a forged 1077.

1316
01:44:31,693 --> 01:44:34,320
- No. Really? No.
- No.

1317
01:44:34,487 --> 01:44:36,156
That'd be horrible.

1318
01:44:36,322 --> 01:44:38,658
It's hard, you know, for dinners.

1319
01:44:38,825 --> 01:44:42,537
Well, you must have very good contacts.

1320
01:44:42,704 --> 01:44:46,249
I hear it usually takes days
to buy your way out.

1321
01:44:47,208 --> 01:44:51,212
- Tess, this is Francois Toulour.
- Madame Ocean, at last.

1322
01:44:51,379 --> 01:44:52,756
- Hello.
- He's French.

1323
01:44:52,922 --> 01:44:55,425
Shouldn't you be somewhere else
by now, like...

1324
01:44:55,717 --> 01:44:58,595
...Outer Mongolia, maybe?

1325
01:44:58,762 --> 01:45:02,682
Well, before we get to that,
we just wanted to ask you one question.

1326
01:45:02,849 --> 01:45:04,476
- What is that?
- How'd you do it?

1327
01:45:04,642 --> 01:45:08,104
Oh, so that's why you came.
You wanna know.

1328
01:45:08,772 --> 01:45:11,358
Well, I guess that's normal.

1329
01:45:12,567 --> 01:45:15,028
But I got another deal for you.

1330
01:45:15,195 --> 01:45:19,282
You both recognize that I'm the best,
and I'll tell you my secret.

1331
01:45:20,283 --> 01:45:22,952
- Yeah.
- That...

1332
01:45:26,498 --> 01:45:28,458
get him to tell us...

1333
01:45:28,625 --> 01:45:31,294
- And tell him that he is the best.
- Oh, okay.

1334
01:45:31,461 --> 01:45:36,633
- I won't tell him because you're the best.
- All right. Thank you.

1335
01:45:37,384 --> 01:45:39,094
All right.

1336
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:43,973
We'll tell you you're the best
after you tell us how you did it.

1337
01:45:49,771 --> 01:45:53,149
How can I refuse
a dying man's last request?

1338
01:45:56,027 --> 01:46:01,366
The egg arrived in Rome at 6:45 p. m.
the Saturday before it went on display.

1339
01:46:01,533 --> 01:46:04,828
- It was at the museum by 8 p.m.
- Wait a minute, hold on.

1340
01:46:04,995 --> 01:46:07,914
You stole it that evening?
With the museum locked down?

1341
01:46:08,081 --> 01:46:11,292
How'd you get in the building?
How'd you get past the sensors?

1342
01:46:11,501 --> 01:46:13,253
Why didn't my recon team see you?

1343
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:16,798
- Don't touch my thing.
- I didn't touch your thing. Like it works.

1344
01:46:16,965 --> 01:46:20,510
You got greasy hands, you put them
on the lens. Now I can't see.

1345
01:46:20,677 --> 01:46:23,763
- You can't see anything.
- I see you. You look like a retard.

1346
01:46:23,930 --> 01:46:25,223
You look like a retard.

1347
01:46:25,390 --> 01:46:29,811
I'll pay you a million dollars if you don't
speak for a month. One month.

1348
01:46:29,978 --> 01:46:35,108
- I wanna eat your whole head.
- Go ahead. A million dollars. No joke.

1349
01:46:35,483 --> 01:46:38,820
Right. With no equipment, no rope.

1350
01:46:38,987 --> 01:46:42,615
Of course. Come on, don't tell me
you don't know how to do that.

1351
01:46:42,782 --> 01:46:46,036
How did you get by the laser field
in the Great Hall?

1352
01:46:48,455 --> 01:46:52,751
The laser fields. Well...

1353
01:48:39,899 --> 01:48:43,737
Okay. Toulour, you're the best.

1354
01:48:43,903 --> 01:48:46,698
Well, thank you, Danny.

1355
01:48:46,865 --> 01:48:51,619
Good. Now, if you can just
get us our money...

1356
01:48:51,786 --> 01:48:53,496
...we'll be going.

1357
01:48:55,165 --> 01:48:56,875
The money?

1358
01:48:57,584 --> 01:48:58,960
What money?

1359
01:48:59,127 --> 01:49:01,921
The money that you agreed to pay
Benedict if we won.

1360
01:49:02,088 --> 01:49:06,217
- We're under a deadline.
- No, no, no, you don't understand.

1361
01:49:06,384 --> 01:49:08,470
You didn't win.

1362
01:49:08,636 --> 01:49:11,389
You lost. And not only did you lose...

1363
01:49:11,556 --> 01:49:14,726
...your entire crew got pinched.
I gotta tell you something.

1364
01:49:15,018 --> 01:49:18,730
You don't look anything like her.
Eventually, the nose, but the ears...

1365
01:49:18,897 --> 01:49:21,274
I mean, the way you walk
and you dress...

1366
01:49:41,461 --> 01:49:45,298
That means that you spoke to LeMarc.

1367
01:49:47,258 --> 01:49:48,843
You spoke to LeMarc?

1368
01:49:57,727 --> 01:50:02,774
Since I'm dead, I think my involvement
in this should stay among the three of us.

1369
01:50:02,941 --> 01:50:04,192
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

1370
01:50:04,359 --> 01:50:10,073
It's ironic that the solution to all of
our problems will be provided by Toulour.

1371
01:50:10,240 --> 01:50:13,076
I'm sure I provoked him by agreeing
with my American friend...

1372
01:50:13,243 --> 01:50:14,995
...that you might be better than him.

1373
01:50:15,161 --> 01:50:18,248
I apologize sincerely for the trouble
I've caused you.

1374
01:50:18,415 --> 01:50:20,625
- There's no need.
- Especially now.

1375
01:50:20,917 --> 01:50:25,588
Remember, from the time you see Toulour
at his villa and the challenge begins...

1376
01:50:25,755 --> 01:50:30,927
...you must assume he will have you
under surveillance everywhere you go.

1377
01:50:31,428 --> 01:50:35,015
You'll have to put on
a very elaborate show.

1378
01:50:35,306 --> 01:50:38,351
The egg, the real egg...

1379
01:50:38,518 --> 01:50:42,063
...will be carried in a backpack
on a train leaving Gare du Nord...

1380
01:50:42,230 --> 01:50:45,191
...at 9:30 a.m.
- Thank you.

1381
01:50:45,358 --> 01:50:47,318
You saved our lives, Gaspar.

1382
01:50:47,485 --> 01:50:51,239
Yeah. And I'm still getting
the better of you.

1383
01:53:03,246 --> 01:53:05,457
And I stole a replica?

1384
01:53:06,458 --> 01:53:10,754
Your paintings are in a high-security
warehouse in Milan.

1385
01:53:10,920 --> 01:53:15,675
It's 17 Via Andreotti, unit 222.

1386
01:53:15,842 --> 01:53:21,790
- Security code is 2-3-1-1-6...
- 6-4-6. Thank you.

1387
01:53:23,808 --> 01:53:28,355
Listen, all games aside, that was...
That was very good.

1388
01:53:28,521 --> 01:53:30,940
That was good. How'd you do that?

1389
01:53:35,945 --> 01:53:40,116
Well, I told you one story tonight.
I think that'll be enough. So now...

1390
01:53:40,283 --> 01:53:45,121
...if you, both of you, could please...
Now.

1391
01:54:19,531 --> 01:54:23,493
- Whose house is this?
- It belongs to a thief I know in Paris.

1392
01:54:23,952 --> 01:54:26,121
He knows my father?

1393
01:54:26,287 --> 01:54:28,707
Probably better than anyone.

1394
01:54:30,041 --> 01:54:31,376
Who is he?

1395
01:54:31,543 --> 01:54:35,255
- He helped with the Night Fox thing.
- What's his name?

1396
01:54:35,422 --> 01:54:38,883
His real name? I don't know, actually.

1397
01:54:41,803 --> 01:54:44,139
I've only known him as LeMarc.

1398
01:54:44,305 --> 01:54:45,974
LeMarc?

1399
01:54:58,028 --> 01:54:59,946
Oh, my God.

1400
01:55:16,504 --> 01:55:18,757
Where the hell have you been?

1401
01:55:19,799 --> 01:55:21,801
Waiting.

1402
01:55:22,385 --> 01:55:24,429
For what?

1403
01:55:24,763 --> 01:55:26,348
For this.

1404
01:55:36,524 --> 01:55:38,902
Oh, my God.

1405
01:56:14,479 --> 01:56:16,523
So we done?

1406
01:56:16,690 --> 01:56:18,441
Issue closed?

1407
01:56:19,025 --> 01:56:23,029
- Is it actually good?
- It's good. Trust me.

1408
01:56:23,196 --> 01:56:26,866
I don't trust you, and I don't
trust Ocean. If it's good, we're done.

1409
01:56:27,033 --> 01:56:30,120
These grudges, they're awful.
Nobody wins.

1410
01:56:30,286 --> 01:56:32,622
Danny's had enough of this meshugaas.

1411
01:56:32,789 --> 01:56:35,375
And the competition,
it's worse than our business.

1412
01:56:35,542 --> 01:56:38,294
Always some new young punk
trying to prove himself.

1413
01:56:40,088 --> 01:56:44,884
Guys like Ocean, they keep coming back.
They don't like to lose.

1414
01:56:45,051 --> 01:56:48,972
- Too much ego, too much pride.
- Maybe for some guys, but not Danny.

1415
01:56:49,139 --> 01:56:52,600
Trust me on that.
Danny don't feel like he lost in all this.

1416
01:56:52,767 --> 01:56:55,645
It's hard to believe,
but that's how he feels.

1417
01:56:55,812 --> 01:56:59,858
Well, if he tries anything... If anybody
tries anything, I'll be waiting.

1418
01:57:00,025 --> 01:57:02,193
Terry, I can't predict the future.

1419
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:05,947
I pay professionals to do that,
and even they get it wrong sometimes.

1420
01:57:06,114 --> 01:57:09,242
I can't say that nobody'll ever
try to rob from you again.

1421
01:57:09,409 --> 01:57:14,164
But I can say this: If, God forbid,
anything does happen to you...

1422
01:57:14,331 --> 01:57:16,416
...we will not be involved.

1423
01:57:16,583 --> 01:57:20,337
You better not be, Reuben.
You better not be.

1424
01:57:34,309 --> 01:57:35,352
Hey.

1425
01:57:37,479 --> 01:57:39,856
Good to see you guys.

1426
01:57:44,778 --> 01:57:48,365
You don't remember? You put me
through hell, and you don't remember?

1427
01:57:49,574 --> 01:57:51,660
- Hey.
- Hey.

1428
01:57:53,912 --> 01:57:56,206
- You're more beautiful than ever.
- Hey!

1429
01:57:57,707 --> 01:57:59,167
- Five-oh-five?
- Four-oh-five.

1430
01:57:59,334 --> 01:58:01,378
- Who's winning?
- I'm little.

1431
01:58:01,544 --> 01:58:03,129
- And you're big.
- You're big?

1432
01:58:03,296 --> 01:58:04,714
Oh, my God.

1433
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:07,092
- Hello.
- Oh, my God.

1434
01:58:09,010 --> 01:58:10,845
You're all under arrest.

1435
01:58:11,012 --> 01:58:13,139
You're thieves. You're crooks.

1436
01:58:15,183 --> 01:58:17,686
Isabel, Livingston Dell.

1437
01:58:18,353 --> 01:58:19,896
Thank you.

1438
01:58:21,815 --> 01:58:22,899
Isabel, Tess.

1439
01:58:23,066 --> 01:58:25,860
The adult table. That's the kids' table.

1440
01:58:26,403 --> 01:58:28,822
- Let me clear that for you.
- I'm in.

1441
01:58:29,030 --> 01:58:30,991
- Right, Danny.
- Can I get another beer?

1442
01:58:31,157 --> 01:58:34,244
- I feel I know you.
- Wait, wait. We didn't... We didn't bet.

1443
01:58:34,786 --> 01:58:35,954
You want five?

1444
01:58:39,124 --> 01:58:40,583
- Five.
- So nasty.

1445
01:58:40,792 --> 01:58:42,335
Okay.

1446
01:58:46,589 --> 01:58:47,590
Is that a joke?

1447
01:58:51,386 --> 01:58:52,971
Yes.

1448
01:58:53,430 --> 01:58:56,558
- Jesus Christ.
- She's drunk!
