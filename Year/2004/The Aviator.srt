1
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:15,393
Q-U...

2
00:01:15,564 --> 00:01:17,555
...A-R...

3
00:01:20,236 --> 00:01:22,466
...A-N-T...

4
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:27,167
...I-N-E.

5
00:01:30,646 --> 00:01:33,012
Quarantine.

6
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:36,675
Q-U-A-R...

7
00:01:39,755 --> 00:01:42,223
...A-N-T...

8
00:01:42,958 --> 00:01:45,449
...I-N-E.

9
00:01:46,028 --> 00:01:47,620
Quarantine.

10
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:49,388
You know the cholera?

11
00:01:49,565 --> 00:01:51,089
Yes, Mother.

12
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:54,202
You've seen the signs on
the houses where the coloreds live?

13
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:56,031
Yes, Mother.

14
00:01:56,205 --> 00:01:57,467
You know the typhus?

15
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,699
I do, Mother.

16
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:04,636
You know what they
can do to you?

17
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:07,039
Yes, Mother.

18
00:02:10,986 --> 00:02:13,352
You are not safe.

19
00:02:20,362 --> 00:02:23,957
You may be directing this movie,
but what you're asking, we can't do.

20
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:26,996
Don't tell me it can't be done.

21
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:30,935
The gyro forces are too much.
You send these planes into barrel rolls...

22
00:02:31,106 --> 00:02:34,598
...they won't make it.
- It's the climax of the picture. Make it work.

23
00:02:34,777 --> 00:02:37,268
Decrease the vertical trajectory
if you have to.

24
00:02:37,446 --> 00:02:39,937
A Le Rhône rotary
won't stall at 60 degrees.

25
00:02:40,115 --> 00:02:43,676
We're still short two cameras.
We need to cut that sequence down...

26
00:02:43,852 --> 00:02:47,253
We're not cutting. I'll get those cameras.
Set up for rehearsals.

27
00:02:47,423 --> 00:02:50,221
I'm Noah Dietrich.
Your office said I'd find you here.

28
00:02:50,392 --> 00:02:52,485
Dietrich.
You're a man on the come.

29
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:56,495
I read your résumé, talked to your references.
Know what I'm looking for?

30
00:02:56,665 --> 00:02:59,691
You're looking for a second-in-command
at Hughes Tools.

31
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:02,632
Someone to oversee
the financial aspects of the business.

32
00:03:02,805 --> 00:03:05,569
I'm looking for somebody to run it
and do a good job.

33
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:08,005
There's only one thing
you've gotta know.

34
00:03:08,177 --> 00:03:11,010
My folks, they're gone now.
So it's my money.

35
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,911
What I do with that money may seem crazy
to those sons of bitches in Houston.

36
00:03:15,084 --> 00:03:18,645
I'm sure it does, but it all makes
good sense to me. You got that?

37
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:20,618
- Got it.
- Good.

38
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:23,917
Now, you made, what,
$5200 a year at your last job?

39
00:03:24,093 --> 00:03:27,961
- I'll pay you $10,000.
- I guess I'll be working twice as hard.

40
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,691
You'll be working four times as hard.
I just got you at half price.

41
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:33,357
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

42
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:35,696
You're my voice now.
Make them understand that.

43
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:40,035
Some of those folks still call me Junior.
You tell them it's "Mr. Hughes" now.

44
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:42,302
You bet.
So when do we go to Houston?

45
00:03:42,478 --> 00:03:45,743
We don't. Cholera epidemic in 1913.
Two thousand dead.

46
00:03:45,914 --> 00:03:47,973
Whole place is nothing but
pestilential swamp.

47
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,246
Typhus, malaria, cholera, yellow fever.
You name it, they got it.

48
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:53,888
You see that, Mr. Dietrich?

49
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:58,951
You are looking at the largest
private air force in the entire world.

50
00:03:59,128 --> 00:04:01,153
What do you think of that, now?

51
00:04:02,564 --> 00:04:04,122
It's your money.

52
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,700
Start them up!

53
00:05:32,654 --> 00:05:36,488
I saw the rough cut of the new
Tod Browning movie, <i>London After Midnight.</i>

54
00:05:36,658 --> 00:05:38,455
Lon Chaney is incredible.

55
00:05:38,627 --> 00:05:40,959
It's his best performance
in a long time.

56
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:43,462
It's gonna be a big hit.
The cards are great.

57
00:05:43,632 --> 00:05:45,065
It's supposed to be...

58
00:05:45,234 --> 00:05:47,668
Hello, Mr. Mayer.

59
00:05:47,836 --> 00:05:50,828
I don't know if you remember me.
My name's Howard Hughes.

60
00:05:51,006 --> 00:05:53,372
I was wondering
if I could have a moment.

61
00:05:53,542 --> 00:05:56,602
- Oh, Howard Hughes. The airplane picture?
- Exactly.

62
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:59,111
- I remember.
<i>- Hell's Angels.</i> You heard of it.

63
00:05:59,281 --> 00:06:00,509
- Good.
- Yes.

64
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:03,480
I was wondering if I could
have a moment of your time.

65
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:04,949
I need a few cameras.

66
00:06:05,788 --> 00:06:08,780
- Yeah?
- Yeah, two, to be exact.

67
00:06:09,691 --> 00:06:13,718
I bought every camera I could find.
We're shooting our big dogfight sequence.

68
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:17,332
I need two more. Desperately.
You think MGM could help me out?

69
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:18,861
With what?

70
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:21,832
- Cameras.
- Oh, with the actual cam...

71
00:06:22,004 --> 00:06:25,201
We're not usually in the practice
of helping out competition.

72
00:06:25,474 --> 00:06:28,500
- No. No.
- So how many cameras do you have now?

73
00:06:28,677 --> 00:06:30,042
Twenty-four.

74
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:35,208
You?
Wait a minute.

75
00:06:37,486 --> 00:06:39,351
- You have 24 cameras?
- That's right.

76
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:42,115
- And you need..? You need two more?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:45,886
- You don't think you got it with 24?
- No. No, sir.

78
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:48,689
You know, I think...
I think we've got them all...

79
00:06:48,864 --> 00:06:51,298
Don't we have them?
They're all used, right?

80
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:53,731
- All 26 of them.
- I only need two, sir.

81
00:06:53,902 --> 00:06:55,767
- Jesus Christ, sonny.
- Howard.

82
00:06:55,938 --> 00:06:58,600
Howard. Let me give you
a little advice, huh?

83
00:06:58,774 --> 00:07:00,867
- Take your oil money...
- Drill bits.

84
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:04,137
All right, take your drill-bit money
and put it in the bank.

85
00:07:04,313 --> 00:07:06,975
If you continue making
the movie the way you are...

86
00:07:07,149 --> 00:07:09,413
...there isn't gonna be a distributor...

87
00:07:09,585 --> 00:07:12,554
...you won't find anybody
who wants to see the movie...

88
00:07:12,721 --> 00:07:15,383
...and you're not gonna have
any more oil money.

89
00:07:15,557 --> 00:07:18,583
So welcome to Hollywood.

90
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,161
Yeah. Well, I'll be sure
to remember that, Mr. Mayer.

91
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:24,128
- Good luck.
- All right.

92
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:27,496
He needs 26 to make it work?
He's out of his mind.

93
00:07:34,743 --> 00:07:37,576
I looked down at my pants.
It was a strange situation.

94
00:07:39,414 --> 00:07:42,144
Boss.
Scram, love boat, let's go.

95
00:07:43,385 --> 00:07:46,411
- Another soda. You know what I mean.
- Milk. In the bottle.

96
00:07:46,588 --> 00:07:49,557
- With the cap still on.
- Okay, what did His Highness say?

97
00:07:49,725 --> 00:07:52,922
Son of a bitch won't part with
a single goddamn camera.

98
00:07:53,095 --> 00:07:55,620
Why don't you try and
make do with what you have.

99
00:07:56,198 --> 00:07:58,962
What I have isn't enough, John,
not for how I see it.

100
00:07:59,134 --> 00:08:00,624
Look.

101
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:04,738
My name depends on this picture.
If it doesn't work, I'm back to Houston...

102
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:07,705
...making goddamn drill bits
for the rest of my life.

103
00:08:07,876 --> 00:08:10,037
Can't you do it
with the cameras you have?

104
00:08:10,212 --> 00:08:12,976
You ought to hear about
what's going on with DeMille.

105
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:17,414
He's shooting his Bible picture.
He's gotta do a crucifixion in Fresno.

106
00:08:17,586 --> 00:08:18,814
Johnny.

107
00:08:18,987 --> 00:08:21,080
- A bunch of tractors...
- Johnny.

108
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:23,417
- You're a press agent, are you not?
- Yeah.

109
00:08:23,592 --> 00:08:25,719
You're supposed to know
the ins and outs?

110
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:27,122
- Absolutely.
- Do you?

111
00:08:27,296 --> 00:08:28,524
Yeah, absolutely.

112
00:08:28,697 --> 00:08:30,756
Then you leave the big ideas...

113
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,493
...to me.
- Oh, yeah. Of course, boss.

114
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,432
Cigar, cigarettes, Sen-Sen?

115
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:38,733
I thought you were
at the Brown Derby...

116
00:08:38,907 --> 00:08:40,636
...with Trixie. No, Theresa.

117
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,333
- Margaret.
- Margaret. Exactly.

118
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:44,638
What happened to Margaret?
She lost her...

119
00:08:44,813 --> 00:08:46,337
Thank God that's settled.

120
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:49,643
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thelma, this is Howard Hughes.

121
00:08:49,818 --> 00:08:53,811
Howard and I were discussing how he
wants me to pull a camera out of my ass.

122
00:08:54,656 --> 00:08:58,456
- Cigarette?
- Oh, no, thanks. I don't smoke.

123
00:09:01,296 --> 00:09:04,595
Boy, you are just hitting
on all six cylinders, aren't you?

124
00:09:04,766 --> 00:09:06,631
My God.

125
00:09:07,235 --> 00:09:09,430
Would you do me
a favor and just?

126
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:12,267
Would you just smile
for me one time? Just once?

127
00:09:15,544 --> 00:09:18,172
Yeah. Yeah. You see,
you got a short upper lip.

128
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:20,344
Makes for a much nicer smile.

129
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,115
See, I wonder what gives
a beautiful woman like you pleasure.

130
00:09:29,358 --> 00:09:32,953
I mean, say you're just standing
there, right? And I just touch you.

131
00:09:33,128 --> 00:09:35,119
Just... Just like this.

132
00:09:35,731 --> 00:09:37,096
With my fingertips.

133
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:39,495
Do you..?
Do you like that?

134
00:09:40,602 --> 00:09:42,194
Do you?

135
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:50,235
You see, I wanna learn
what pleases you.

136
00:09:51,446 --> 00:09:54,506
I wanna learn everything about you.

137
00:09:54,683 --> 00:09:56,708
Would you let me do that?

138
00:09:56,885 --> 00:09:59,080
Would you give me that job?

139
00:10:04,226 --> 00:10:06,194
I'm off in a half an hour.

140
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:10,626
- Well, I'm in room...
- 217.

141
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,733
217.

142
00:10:14,736 --> 00:10:16,601
See you there.

143
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:23,434
Johnny, get on the horn
to Universal and Warners.

144
00:10:23,612 --> 00:10:25,477
I need two more cameras
by Saturday.

145
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:28,411
Rent them if you can.
Steal them if you have to.

146
00:10:29,151 --> 00:10:31,244
Absotively, boss.

147
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,948
Absotively.

148
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,387
<i>Rumors coming from a lonely airstrip</i>
<i>out in Van Nuys.</i>

149
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:40,858
<i>Sources whisper that young</i>
<i>Texas industrialist Howard Hughes...</i>

150
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:43,429
<i>... won't stop pouring money</i>
<i>into his war epic.</i>

151
00:10:43,598 --> 00:10:44,997
<i>And do we mean epic!</i>

152
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:48,000
<i>One hundred and thirty-seven pilots,</i>
<i>87 airplanes...</i>

153
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:52,573
<i>... 35 cameramen, 2000 extras.</i>
<i>How long will it be before this picture...</i>

154
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:54,971
<i>... ends up costing as</i>
<i>much as the real war?</i>

155
00:10:55,143 --> 00:10:57,373
Damn it.
Why the hell do they look so slow?

156
00:10:57,546 --> 00:11:01,141
This isn't what it was like up there.
They look like goddamn models!

157
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:10,957
Son of a bitch.

158
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,659
Howard?

159
00:11:16,231 --> 00:11:20,133
Without something standing
still behind the planes...

160
00:11:20,302 --> 00:11:22,862
...we've got no idea
of how fast we're moving.

161
00:11:23,038 --> 00:11:25,871
We got no sense of relative motion.

162
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:29,704
Call UCLA.
Get me the best meteorologist they got.

163
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:31,971
You get him here in an hour, all right?

164
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,148
Hey. You want the good news
or the bad news?

165
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,878
- Bad news, always.
- All right.

166
00:11:40,055 --> 00:11:43,252
We installed the 450 radial.
Struts won't take the vibration.

167
00:11:43,425 --> 00:11:47,225
Minute we fire her up, the struts
start cracking at the attach points.

168
00:11:47,462 --> 00:11:50,192
- Well, what's the good news?
- There isn't any.

169
00:11:50,599 --> 00:11:54,194
Goddamn it, Odie. If the 450's too big,
we figure something else out.

170
00:11:54,369 --> 00:11:57,338
We've done everything.
We've rebuilt her from top to toe.

171
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:59,303
If we drain the fuel tank...

172
00:11:59,474 --> 00:12:03,137
...she might make 180 miles per hour.
- I want minimum 200, all right?

173
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:06,178
I want a date with Theda Bara.
That ain't gonna happen.

174
00:12:06,348 --> 00:12:08,248
Oh, don't be so sure.

175
00:12:08,617 --> 00:12:12,485
If the struts won't sustain the engine
we need, we gotta get rid of the struts.

176
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:14,713
No, then the top wing falls off.

177
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:18,983
Then let it.

178
00:12:19,494 --> 00:12:20,961
What?

179
00:12:22,264 --> 00:12:24,289
Who says we need a top wing?

180
00:12:24,466 --> 00:12:26,525
I mean, who says we need anything?

181
00:12:28,703 --> 00:12:31,137
- A monoplane.
- A cantilevered monoplane, right?

182
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:34,503
They're doing it in France.
To hell with the top wing and struts.

183
00:12:34,676 --> 00:12:37,076
- A 550 Wasp engine.
- One-hundred-octane fuel.

184
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:40,544
- That would give us a horsepower of what?
- Seven hundred.

185
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:46,213
We squeeze that to a thousand,
we got the fastest plane ever built.

186
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:50,548
You know, I've gotta say...

187
00:12:50,725 --> 00:12:54,422
...we've already spent over $200,000
rebuilding this plane.

188
00:12:55,864 --> 00:12:57,456
To hell with it.

189
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,965
Tear it up, Odie.

190
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:01,500
Go on.

191
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:06,504
Well...

192
00:13:09,444 --> 00:13:13,141
The cumulonimbus formations
about which you speak...

193
00:13:14,616 --> 00:13:16,743
...that look like...

194
00:13:16,918 --> 00:13:18,715
Giant breasts full of milk.

195
00:13:18,887 --> 00:13:20,616
I want clouds, damn it.

196
00:13:20,989 --> 00:13:22,581
Yes, clouds...

197
00:13:22,757 --> 00:13:26,557
...that look like
giant breasts full of milk...

198
00:13:26,728 --> 00:13:30,255
...cannot exactly be guaranteed
for any particular occasion.

199
00:13:30,432 --> 00:13:32,525
So you might have to...

200
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:35,200
To wait.

201
00:13:37,305 --> 00:13:39,239
Then we'll wait.

202
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:42,540
Look, whatever they pay
you at UCLA...

203
00:13:42,711 --> 00:13:46,306
...I'm doubling it, all right?
You work for me now. Find some clouds.

204
00:13:47,782 --> 00:13:49,147
Find some clouds.

205
00:13:49,818 --> 00:13:51,581
Find me some clouds!

206
00:13:51,753 --> 00:13:53,948
Welcome to <i>Hell's Angels.</i>

207
00:13:57,158 --> 00:13:58,386
Thank you.

208
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:10,493
I've been to Chatsworth,
Santa Cruz, Encino, San Diego...

209
00:14:10,672 --> 00:14:14,540
...Riverside, Van Nuys and Bakersfield.
It has been eight months!

210
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:16,506
Where are my goddamn clouds, huh?

211
00:14:16,678 --> 00:14:19,010
They move, Mr. Hughes!

212
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,511
Clouds move.

213
00:14:20,682 --> 00:14:23,150
- That's what they do. They move!
- You see that?

214
00:14:23,318 --> 00:14:27,015
It is costing me $5271 a day...

215
00:14:27,188 --> 00:14:31,591
...to keep those planes on the ground.
You find me some goddamn clouds, huh?

216
00:14:39,034 --> 00:14:40,524
Nice day.

217
00:14:41,002 --> 00:14:42,902
Yeah, very funny.

218
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:46,004
I got a call from Houston.
They're getting nervous.

219
00:14:46,174 --> 00:14:48,108
Stop showing them the damn bills.

220
00:14:48,276 --> 00:14:49,641
That would be illegal.

221
00:14:49,811 --> 00:14:52,041
Shit, no.
Maybe it's a little bit naughty.

222
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:56,081
Hughes Tool is incorporated in Texas.
They have to see the bills.

223
00:14:57,485 --> 00:15:01,046
Incorporate a new division out here.
We'll call it Hughes Aircraft.

224
00:15:01,222 --> 00:15:05,784
- Do we need these rivets on the cowling?
- Yeah, or the reverse thrust would rip it off.

225
00:15:05,961 --> 00:15:08,657
They're gonna give me drag.
Do something about that.

226
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,094
- Wind resistance on rivets?
- I want her slippery.

227
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:14,292
There are tax consequences
to incorporating in California.

228
00:15:14,469 --> 00:15:16,937
- Just take care of it, would you?
- Mr. Hughes!

229
00:15:17,105 --> 00:15:18,902
Oakland!

230
00:15:19,074 --> 00:15:22,100
- We have clouds in Oakland!
- You mean it this time?

231
00:15:22,277 --> 00:15:23,835
Yes!

232
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:27,106
Goddamn it, yes.
I can promise you.

233
00:15:27,282 --> 00:15:30,547
- Clouds in Oakland.
- All right, don't get all jittery now.

234
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:32,118
Oakland!

235
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:34,886
Oakland!

236
00:15:35,056 --> 00:15:38,287
We're going to Oakland!
Oakland.

237
00:16:14,462 --> 00:16:17,090
Down and to the left!

238
00:16:40,088 --> 00:16:42,079
That's perfect!

239
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:50,363
That's right, Senator George.

240
00:16:50,532 --> 00:16:53,228
<i>Yes, young Howard Hughes</i>
<i>has pulled it off!</i>

241
00:16:53,401 --> 00:16:56,802
<i>After two years,</i> Hell's Angels
<i>has finally finished filming.</i>

242
00:16:56,971 --> 00:17:00,099
<i>There's gonna be one heck</i>
<i>of a wrap party in Hollywood tonight.</i>

243
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:02,971
<i>The price tag?</i>
<i>A staggering $2 million.</i>

244
00:17:03,144 --> 00:17:05,635
<i>If every human being</i>
<i>in America buys a ticket...</i>

245
00:17:05,814 --> 00:17:07,543
<i>... he might even make a profit.</i>

246
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:13,985
First, clouds don't come.

247
00:17:14,155 --> 00:17:16,555
Then planes break down.
Then the planes crash.

248
00:17:18,226 --> 00:17:21,286
We've had everything but
a plague of locusts on this thing.

249
00:17:21,463 --> 00:17:22,828
I mean, you have to admit.

250
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:26,990
Now, honestly, did you ever think
you'd actually finish the damn thing?

251
00:17:29,204 --> 00:17:30,603
Come with me.

252
00:17:32,507 --> 00:17:35,772
<i>Mama, darling,</i>
<i>if I'm a success in this show...</i>

253
00:17:35,944 --> 00:17:38,003
<i>- ... we're gonna move from here.</i>
<i>- Oh, no.</i>

254
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:40,147
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>We're gonna move up in the Bronx.</i>

255
00:17:40,315 --> 00:17:42,374
<i>Green grass,</i>
<i>a lot of people you know.</i>

256
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,246
<i>The Ginsbergs,</i>
<i>the Guttenbergs and the Goldbergs.</i>

257
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,116
<i>Oh, a whole lot of "bergs."</i>
<i>I don't know them all.</i>

258
00:17:48,723 --> 00:17:52,489
See, this is what the people want.
Silent pictures are yesterday's news.

259
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:55,652
So I figure we gotta reshoot
<i>Hell's Angels</i> for sound.

260
00:17:58,066 --> 00:17:59,590
How much of it?

261
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:02,031
All of it.
Before you ask, I'll tell you.

262
00:18:02,203 --> 00:18:05,070
An additional 1.7 million.
We got that much?

263
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,472
- No!
- Well, we'll make it.

264
00:18:09,644 --> 00:18:11,373
Take care of that, would you?

265
00:18:11,546 --> 00:18:12,877
<i>Now, get this.</i>

266
00:18:22,957 --> 00:18:25,118
<i>In the halls of 7000 Romaine...</i>

267
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:27,727
<i>... it goes on day after day,</i>
<i>month after month.</i>

268
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:31,593
<i>Howard Hughes is now editing</i>
<i>some 25 miles of film.</i>

269
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:37,597
<i>Heck, I say release it now and give</i>
<i>the world its first 560-hour movie.</i>

270
00:18:37,772 --> 00:18:42,038
Pat, Mr. Hughes needs this reel
in the projection room right now!

271
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:44,503
<i>Enough is enough, Mr. Hughes.</i>

272
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:47,876
<i>Are you ever gonna let us</i>
<i>actually see this epic of yours?</i>

273
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:49,539
Hurry up!

274
00:19:10,538 --> 00:19:11,937
- Who is it?
- Noah.

275
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:13,767
Come on in.

276
00:19:15,343 --> 00:19:17,937
I've been on the phone
to Houston for three hours.

277
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:21,104
- We're fixing every goddamn book we have.
- Wait, wait.

278
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,451
Yeah. Run reel 10 again.
I think we're duplicating a shot here.

279
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,454
And tell Jimmy I want
10 chocolate chip cookies, all right?

280
00:19:29,624 --> 00:19:32,491
Medium chips,
none too close to the outside.

281
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,150
Got it?

282
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:36,661
You remember
that goddamn shot from reel 10?

283
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,425
No. I don't remember
anything from reel 10.

284
00:19:39,601 --> 00:19:41,762
I don't know what reel 10 is.

285
00:19:41,936 --> 00:19:45,201
I'm a businessman, Howard.
And so are you.

286
00:19:45,373 --> 00:19:47,170
Now, look.

287
00:19:47,342 --> 00:19:48,809
This has been a great ride.

288
00:19:48,977 --> 00:19:50,911
We've had a hell of a lot of fun.

289
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:54,975
But you're losing
$25,000 a day doing this.

290
00:19:55,283 --> 00:19:57,183
Every day.

291
00:20:02,757 --> 00:20:05,590
So, what are my options?

292
00:20:07,161 --> 00:20:09,891
Well, this time I don't know
that you have any.

293
00:20:10,064 --> 00:20:12,498
I'm afraid you gotta close it down.

294
00:20:13,268 --> 00:20:14,860
Dig your way out.

295
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,533
I'm sorry, Howard.

296
00:20:24,112 --> 00:20:25,909
I truly am.

297
00:20:33,288 --> 00:20:34,880
<i>Reel 10, Mr. Hughes.</i>

298
00:20:40,928 --> 00:20:42,953
Mortgage Tool Co.

299
00:20:43,865 --> 00:20:48,962
- Every asset. You heard me.
- lf you do that, you could lose everything.

300
00:20:49,137 --> 00:20:50,695
Well, I won't.

301
00:20:53,841 --> 00:20:55,308
I won't.

302
00:20:56,778 --> 00:20:58,575
All right.

303
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:01,408
I'll get into it.

304
00:21:02,784 --> 00:21:04,342
Thanks, Noah.

305
00:21:39,454 --> 00:21:43,185
<i>More than half a million souls lining</i>

311

00:23:30,164 --> 00:23:31,927
Yes.

333
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:33,498
Yeah.

334
00:23:33,668 --> 00:23:36,296
So 4 million clams
from your own pocket.

335
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:38,098
Nervous how the flick will fly?

336
00:23:41,676 --> 00:23:44,975
Big night. You enjoy the show.

337
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,850
Yes, well, let me present the feminine
star of this spectacle, <i>Hell's Angels...</i>

338
00:23:51,018 --> 00:23:53,612
...Miss Jean Harlow.
- Thank you.

339
00:23:53,788 --> 00:23:56,757
I would like to use this occasion
to thank Mr. Hughes...

340
00:23:56,924 --> 00:24:00,223
...for the opportunity he gave me.
Thank you.

341
00:24:00,394 --> 00:24:03,761
Thank you!
Now I'd like to ask Roscoe Arbuckle...

342
00:24:03,931 --> 00:24:06,900
...to introduce
his pet lion cub, Gilmore.

343
00:24:07,068 --> 00:24:09,730
What's the matter with you?
Can't remember my name?

344
00:24:09,904 --> 00:24:13,897
I'm sorry. Roscoe Turner,
and this would be Gilmore.

345
00:24:57,018 --> 00:24:58,679
It's going! It's going!

346
00:25:00,354 --> 00:25:03,790
Murder! That's what this
dirty, rotten politician war is, murder!

347
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:05,425
You know it as well as I do.

348
00:25:43,197 --> 00:25:44,789
Stand up, slim, take a bow.

349
00:25:58,412 --> 00:26:00,642
Reel four played too long.
Too many coughs.

350
00:26:00,815 --> 00:26:04,774
Get the team out of the party and
to the office. I wanna cut a few shots.

351
00:26:04,952 --> 00:26:07,182
Oh, find Glenn.
Somebody write this down.

352
00:26:07,355 --> 00:26:08,583
Flush rivets.
Got that?

353
00:26:08,756 --> 00:26:10,451
- Flush rivets.
- Flush rivets.

354
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:12,149
Lickety-split, boss.

355
00:26:12,393 --> 00:26:14,020
Here he is! Here he is!

356
00:26:16,097 --> 00:26:17,997
Variety <i>says, "This one won't miss!"</i>

357
00:26:18,165 --> 00:26:21,430
<i>- Magnificently photographed!</i>
<i>- Awesome beyond description!</i>

358
00:26:21,602 --> 00:26:25,197
<i>The most extraordinary output</i>
<i>to emerge from a motion-picture studio.</i>

359
00:26:25,373 --> 00:26:28,308
<i>Not for a long time have I seen</i>
<i>anything as enthralling.</i>

360
00:26:28,476 --> 00:26:31,502
<i>It costs 4 million dollars</i>
<i>and has 4 million thrills!</i>

361
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,977
<i>- Majestically...</i>
<i>- Most epic picture of its time!</i>

362
00:27:29,437 --> 00:27:32,406
A lighter shade. I don't want
to look like Boris Karloff.

363
00:27:32,573 --> 00:27:34,165
If you know what I mean.

364
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:40,046
I read in the magazines
that you play golf.

365
00:27:40,214 --> 00:27:41,875
On occasion.

366
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:44,279
Well, how about nine holes?

367
00:27:46,387 --> 00:27:48,548
Now, Mr. Hughes?

368
00:27:49,223 --> 00:27:51,953
If it would be convenient, Miss Hepburn.

369
00:28:14,515 --> 00:28:17,973
You're not extending
enough on your follow-through.

370
00:28:18,152 --> 00:28:21,087
Follow-through
is everything in golf, just like life.

371
00:28:21,255 --> 00:28:22,552
Don't you find?

372
00:28:22,723 --> 00:28:24,748
Saw your <i>Scarface</i> picture.

373
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:26,222
- Violent.
- Realistic.

374
00:28:26,393 --> 00:28:28,725
Movies are movies, Howard.
Not life.

375
00:28:28,896 --> 00:28:30,591
Now the stage.

376
00:28:30,765 --> 00:28:31,993
The stage is real.

377
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:36,159
Real flesh and blood. Human beings
right out there in front of you, buster.

378
00:28:36,337 --> 00:28:39,306
Can't look away. Can't munch popcorn.
That would be rude.

379
00:28:39,473 --> 00:28:40,735
Do you like the theater?

380
00:28:41,041 --> 00:28:43,532
- No.
- Oh, I adore the theater.

381
00:28:43,711 --> 00:28:45,872
Only alive on-stage.
I'll teach you.

382
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:49,982
We'll see some Ibsen. If the Republicans
haven't outlawed him by now.

383
00:28:50,151 --> 00:28:53,177
You're not a Republican, are you?
How did you vote in '32?

384
00:28:53,354 --> 00:28:56,812
- Well, I didn't.
- You must! It's your sacred franchise.

385
00:29:00,694 --> 00:29:03,458
Heard you were wooing Ginger Rogers.
What about that?

386
00:29:03,631 --> 00:29:05,963
She's just a friend.

387
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:07,828
Men can't be friends with women.

388
00:29:08,002 --> 00:29:10,061
They must possess them
or leave them be.

389
00:29:10,237 --> 00:29:13,365
It's a primitive urge from caveman days.
It's all in Darwin.

390
00:29:13,541 --> 00:29:18,877
Hunt the flesh, kill the flesh, eat the flesh.
That's the male sex all over.

391
00:29:19,547 --> 00:29:20,912
Excuse me?

392
00:29:21,715 --> 00:29:24,707
Well, if you're deaf,
you must own up to it.

393
00:29:24,985 --> 00:29:26,919
Get a hearing aid.
Or see my father.

394
00:29:27,087 --> 00:29:30,750
He's a urologist, but it's all tied up
inside the body, don't you find?

395
00:29:31,091 --> 00:29:32,558
Me, I keep healthy.

396
00:29:32,726 --> 00:29:34,853
I take seven showers a day
to keep clean.

397
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:38,362
Also because I am what's so
vulgarly referred to as "outdoorsy."

398
00:29:38,532 --> 00:29:42,525
I'm not outdoorsy.
I'm athletic. I sweat.

399
00:29:42,703 --> 00:29:45,467
There it is.
Now we both know the sordid truth.

400
00:29:45,639 --> 00:29:48,107
I sweat and you're deaf.

401
00:29:48,275 --> 00:29:51,142
Aren't we a fine pair of misfits?

402
00:29:54,715 --> 00:29:56,580
Three.

403
00:30:04,124 --> 00:30:05,955
Noble effort.

404
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:11,025
So I suppose you're
wooing me now?

405
00:30:11,699 --> 00:30:13,690
Oh, well.

406
00:30:32,753 --> 00:30:34,243
Not enough.

407
00:30:34,822 --> 00:30:37,848
Not enough.
These rivets have to be completely flush.

408
00:30:38,025 --> 00:30:40,926
I want every screw and joint countersunk.

409
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:43,959
I want no wind resistance
on the fuselage.

410
00:30:44,131 --> 00:30:46,429
She has got to be clean, Odie.

411
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,363
- Clean. Understand?
- Okay, Howard.

412
00:30:48,535 --> 00:30:50,332
I don't know
what else to tell you.

413
00:30:51,405 --> 00:30:54,966
- What do you got for me?
- The thing is, TWA needs a new plane.

414
00:30:55,142 --> 00:30:57,770
- A modern plane.
- Oh, yeah? What kind of plane?

415
00:30:57,945 --> 00:31:00,175
Okay. The DC-3 has 21 daytime seats...

416
00:31:00,347 --> 00:31:02,781
...and 14 overnight berths.
- Something bigger?

417
00:31:04,118 --> 00:31:06,484
Try 50 seats with
a ceiling of 12,000 feet.

418
00:31:06,654 --> 00:31:08,884
No. No, 20,000.

419
00:31:09,256 --> 00:31:11,383
Think about it.
What does 20,000 feet give you?

420
00:31:11,558 --> 00:31:14,152
- Less turbulence.
- Because it's above the weather.

421
00:31:14,328 --> 00:31:16,694
Jack, we wanna fly
above the weather.

422
00:31:16,864 --> 00:31:20,425
Only 1 percent of the American population
has set foot on an airliner.

423
00:31:20,601 --> 00:31:23,365
Why? Because they're scared to death.
They should be.

424
00:31:23,537 --> 00:31:26,131
I mean, 7000 feet is bumpy as shit.
You know that.

425
00:31:26,307 --> 00:31:28,798
We build a plane
that flies above the weather...

426
00:31:28,976 --> 00:31:32,742
...we could get every man, woman
and child in this country to feel safe.

427
00:31:32,913 --> 00:31:37,407
An airplane with the ability to fly into
the substratosphere across the country.

428
00:31:37,584 --> 00:31:39,415
Across the world.

429
00:31:39,586 --> 00:31:41,679
Now that is the future.

430
00:31:42,122 --> 00:31:43,350
- You with me?
- Yeah.

431
00:31:43,524 --> 00:31:47,460
I don't wanna get into this
if your board doesn't have the balls for it.

432
00:31:47,628 --> 00:31:49,926
- Would they support us?
- I don't know.

433
00:31:50,097 --> 00:31:52,327
- What's your financial picture?
- Not great.

434
00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:54,660
- Last year's deficit?
- 770,000.

435
00:31:54,835 --> 00:31:57,531
- What's it selling at?
- About 8 dollars a share.

436
00:31:57,705 --> 00:31:59,434
That's the lowest it's been, huh?

437
00:32:01,408 --> 00:32:02,875
I could do that.

438
00:32:03,043 --> 00:32:04,533
- Do what?
- Buy it.

439
00:32:04,712 --> 00:32:07,374
- You wanna buy the airline?
- For crying out loud...

440
00:32:07,548 --> 00:32:11,450
...we don't want pencil pushers getting
in the way of us making our plane.

441
00:32:11,618 --> 00:32:15,452
Give me brass tacks, now. What does
controlling interest in TWA cost me?

442
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,889
Call it 15 million.

443
00:32:20,294 --> 00:32:22,455
That is a chunk of change, huh?

444
00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:27,730
You call Noah Dietrich.

445
00:32:27,901 --> 00:32:29,869
You have him start buying.

446
00:32:30,037 --> 00:32:31,299
Howard, hold on.

447
00:32:31,472 --> 00:32:34,498
Are you sure?
You wanna think about it for five minutes?

448
00:32:34,675 --> 00:32:38,509
Hell, Jack, I got a tiger by the tail here.
I ain't gonna let it go.

449
00:32:47,321 --> 00:32:49,050
Good evening, Mr. Hughes.

450
00:32:49,223 --> 00:32:51,589
Welcome. Your table is ready.

451
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,284
How goes the aviation?

452
00:32:54,461 --> 00:32:57,430
- Oh, just fine, Pete.
- I'm so glad.

453
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:01,098
Good evening, Mr. Hughes.

454
00:33:01,268 --> 00:33:02,496
- Madame.
- It's "miss."

455
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:05,103
Miss. The usual, Mr. Hughes?

456
00:33:05,272 --> 00:33:07,399
- Please.
- May I recommend for the lady...

457
00:33:07,574 --> 00:33:11,066
...our clementine soup followed
by roast duck with currant glaze...

458
00:33:11,245 --> 00:33:14,214
...and poached pears in rose sauce.
It's truly divine.

459
00:33:14,381 --> 00:33:15,871
Yeah. That sounds fine.

460
00:33:18,052 --> 00:33:20,782
Your kind of joint, is it?

461
00:33:21,922 --> 00:33:23,480
Wouldn't have thought.

462
00:33:23,657 --> 00:33:26,854
They're open late.
I go to a hot-dog stand on La Cienega too.

463
00:33:27,027 --> 00:33:29,689
- They're open till about 4.
- Are they?

464
00:33:31,732 --> 00:33:33,563
How marvelous.

465
00:33:49,416 --> 00:33:51,043
Howard! Howard!

466
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:54,783
Hi! Son of a gun.

467
00:33:54,955 --> 00:33:58,789
Kate, this is Johnny Meyer.
I suppose you could call him my press agent.

468
00:33:58,959 --> 00:34:01,223
- Pleased to meet you. Loved <i>Alice Adams.</i>
- You're too kind.

469
00:34:01,395 --> 00:34:04,091
- I'm sure you know Errol, right?
- Mr. Flynn. Yes.

470
00:34:04,264 --> 00:34:09,133
Kate. Kate. Kate of the clenched-jawed
Hepburns. Enchanting as always.

471
00:34:09,303 --> 00:34:11,999
You should use Lux on your hands,
by the way. I do.

472
00:34:12,172 --> 00:34:14,333
You and Howard
ought to cook up a picture.

473
00:34:14,508 --> 00:34:17,033
Costar with Errol.
I could sell that in spades.

474
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:19,406
That would be marvelous. Howard?

475
00:34:20,013 --> 00:34:23,744
I think not.
Don't you read <i>Variety,</i> Mr. Meyer?

476
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:27,614
Well, I'm box-office poison.
I'm on the outs, the skids, the doldrums.

477
00:34:27,788 --> 00:34:31,155
Washed-up, day-old fish
not worth the eating, so they tell me.

478
00:34:31,325 --> 00:34:35,159
Hell with them. Hell with them, my dear.
Soulless pricks to a man, right?

479
00:34:35,329 --> 00:34:39,356
Johnny tells me you're thinking about
doing a Western, of all goddamn things.

480
00:34:43,437 --> 00:34:46,201
Are you making a Western, Howard?

481
00:34:46,406 --> 00:34:49,170
Yeah. Making a Western.
I'm gonna call it <i>The Outlaw.</i>

482
00:34:49,343 --> 00:34:51,504
Yeah. And you know
what it's about? S-E-X.

483
00:34:51,678 --> 00:34:54,374
- It's all about S-E-X.
- It's a Western.

484
00:34:54,548 --> 00:34:57,449
You can't have fornication in a Western.
It isn't done.

485
00:34:57,618 --> 00:34:59,415
It's not real sex, it's movie sex.

486
00:34:59,586 --> 00:35:03,249
What <i>Scarface</i> did for the gangster picture,
<i>The Outlaw</i> will do for the Western.

487
00:35:03,423 --> 00:35:06,290
Put the sex and guts and blood
up there on the screen.

488
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,485
- Have you seen my cigarettes?
- Don't mind us.

489
00:35:08,662 --> 00:35:12,063
New York cut steak, 12 peas,
bottle of milk with the cap on.

490
00:35:12,232 --> 00:35:15,463
- You can't afford your own cigarettes?
- Jack has all my money.

491
00:35:15,636 --> 00:35:19,936
I hope your food isn't getting cold
at your table somewhere or something.

492
00:35:20,107 --> 00:35:22,405
No, no. We're here all night.
Don't worry.

493
00:35:22,576 --> 00:35:28,105
Now, Howard. Now, Howard. If you're
seriously talking about putting carnality...

494
00:35:28,282 --> 00:35:32,946
...back on the silver screen, you must swear
to let me in on the casting session.

495
00:35:36,089 --> 00:35:40,958
- I have an eye for talent. Isn't that right?
- You ought to give up prancing in tights...

496
00:35:41,128 --> 00:35:44,723
...be a talent scout.
- That prancing paid for my new yacht.

497
00:35:44,898 --> 00:35:48,356
You must all come sailing with me.
Catalina. What do you say?

498
00:35:48,535 --> 00:35:51,698
- Catalina. Sounds grand. Yeah.
- I've even managed to coax...

499
00:35:51,872 --> 00:35:55,740
...the luscious Miss De Havilland
and her equally luscious sister to come.

500
00:35:55,909 --> 00:36:00,778
Though I fear their mother will insist on
coming, to preserve their questionable virtue.

501
00:36:00,948 --> 00:36:05,146
We shall assault these twin monuments
of pristine Britannic beauty nonetheless.

502
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:07,378
- What do you say, Howard?
- Yeah?

503
00:36:07,788 --> 00:36:09,949
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

504
00:36:14,261 --> 00:36:15,558
I gotta go.

505
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,957
If you'll excuse us, we have...
We have to be somewhere.

506
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,768
You are somewhere, Howard,
you madman.

507
00:36:22,936 --> 00:36:25,962
- Somewhere else. Excuse us.
- Charmed, gentlemen.

508
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:29,768
Do help yourself to the poached pears.
I hear they're divine.

509
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,174
Well. Howard Hughes,
ladies and gentlemen.

510
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:35,378
Was that meant for me?

511
00:36:35,549 --> 00:36:38,916
My hero. God, all that
Hollywood talk bores me silly.

512
00:36:39,086 --> 00:36:42,055
As if there aren't more important things,
like Mussolini.

513
00:36:42,222 --> 00:36:46,158
- Where are we going, by the way?
- Do you feel like a little adventure?

514
00:36:46,326 --> 00:36:48,260
Do your worst, Mr. Hughes.

515
00:36:48,428 --> 00:36:52,626
- Think you own this place, you limey bastard?
- I'm a Tasmanian bastard, you prick.

516
00:36:52,799 --> 00:36:55,199
- Thataway, Errol.
- Let me at him!

517
00:37:28,802 --> 00:37:31,498
That's Mr. Mayer's house right there.

518
00:37:31,672 --> 00:37:33,572
Do you know where Jack Warner lives?

519
00:37:42,849 --> 00:37:46,649
- What's that on the steering wheel?
- Cellophane.

520
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,688
If you had any idea of the crap
that people carry around on their hands.

521
00:37:51,224 --> 00:37:52,851
What kind of crap?

522
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,221
You don't wanna know.

523
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,434
Hold on to the wheel for a bit.

524
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:13,638
That's too hard. Relax your hand.
Relax your hand.

525
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:24,279
You see, you gotta feel the vibration
of the engine through your fingertips.

526
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:27,518
- Do you feel that?
- Yes.

527
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,791
Well, that's good.

528
00:38:32,432 --> 00:38:34,127
Golly!

529
00:38:38,538 --> 00:38:40,335
Well, she's all yours.

530
00:38:40,574 --> 00:38:44,237
- Where are you going?!
- I think there's some milk back here.

531
00:38:45,245 --> 00:38:48,043
- You just keep us steady, now.
- All right.

532
00:39:07,033 --> 00:39:08,864
- Howard.
- Yeah?

533
00:39:09,035 --> 00:39:12,004
There's a rather alarming mountain
heading our way.

534
00:39:12,172 --> 00:39:14,367
Pull back on the wheel a smidge.
Go on.

535
00:39:19,212 --> 00:39:21,806
Golly!

536
00:39:27,354 --> 00:39:32,519
I don't think I've ever met someone
who actually uses the word "golly."

537
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:42,234
You all right?
Do you want me to take over?

538
00:39:42,402 --> 00:39:44,393
Just when I'm getting the hang of it?

539
00:39:49,776 --> 00:39:53,473
- You want some milk?
- Oh, please.

540
00:40:15,402 --> 00:40:17,632
Utterly smashing!
We'll do it again.

541
00:40:17,804 --> 00:40:20,967
I'm free Wednesday.
It's a little early for golf, though.

542
00:40:21,141 --> 00:40:23,405
Oh, no, no. I live right there.

543
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,470
- Feel like a drink?
- Lead on.

544
00:40:27,681 --> 00:40:30,878
Now, that makes
for a challenging par four.

545
00:40:31,117 --> 00:40:34,814
My decorator
picked out the wallpaper and such.

546
00:40:35,455 --> 00:40:37,514
He's queer as a bedbug.

547
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:40,421
But I just hate this room.

548
00:40:40,727 --> 00:40:42,558
Gives me the willies.

549
00:40:43,063 --> 00:40:47,159
Like I'm about to be swallowed up
by the latest issue of <i>Town & Country.</i>

550
00:40:55,809 --> 00:40:57,572
What room do you like?

551
00:40:58,845 --> 00:41:00,335
My study.

552
00:41:02,716 --> 00:41:04,377
Take me there.

553
00:41:20,734 --> 00:41:23,760
You are the tallest woman I know.

554
00:41:24,704 --> 00:41:28,800
And all sharp elbows and knees.
Beware.

555
00:41:51,331 --> 00:41:54,391
Will you fly me to work tomorrow?

556
00:41:57,003 --> 00:41:59,198
It is tomorrow.

557
00:42:51,992 --> 00:42:55,758
Keep your eye on the fuel. She's got
a minimum to keep her weight down.

558
00:42:55,929 --> 00:42:58,955
Two runs. That's it.
After that, you're flying on vapors.

559
00:42:59,132 --> 00:43:01,896
And then you crash and you die.
Give her easy flying.

560
00:43:02,068 --> 00:43:05,367
Don't worry about speed
and don't think about the record today.

561
00:43:05,538 --> 00:43:08,996
I wish you'd let someone else take her.
You've got 20 test pilots.

562
00:43:09,175 --> 00:43:13,509
Hell, why should I let someone else
have all the fun? See you in a bit.

563
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:36,230
Contact!

564
00:45:05,859 --> 00:45:07,087
339.

565
00:45:09,195 --> 00:45:11,060
Goddamn!

566
00:45:32,786 --> 00:45:34,310
347.

567
00:45:35,755 --> 00:45:37,052
Son of a bitch!

568
00:46:09,422 --> 00:46:11,982
- 352.
- 352!

569
00:46:13,226 --> 00:46:14,454
Good girl.

570
00:46:24,237 --> 00:46:25,932
Damn it!

571
00:46:29,742 --> 00:46:31,869
Goddamn it!

572
00:46:32,312 --> 00:46:34,542
- Oh, God!
- There goes our meal ticket.

573
00:46:34,714 --> 00:46:36,204
Come on!

574
00:47:16,356 --> 00:47:17,789
Howard!

575
00:47:17,957 --> 00:47:20,118
- Howard!
- How did we do?

576
00:47:21,227 --> 00:47:23,559
352 on the last run.

577
00:47:25,331 --> 00:47:26,958
She'll go faster.

578
00:47:27,533 --> 00:47:29,160
Country mouse!

579
00:47:29,936 --> 00:47:33,337
- Kate! Katie!
- Upstairs, city mouse.

580
00:47:36,442 --> 00:47:39,343
Hello.
Good Lord, what happened to you?

581
00:47:39,512 --> 00:47:41,742
Oh, nothing. A hard landing.
I cut my foot.

582
00:47:41,915 --> 00:47:44,941
Sit down. I'll take care of it.
You tell me everything.

583
00:47:45,118 --> 00:47:48,952
You cannot imagine what it was like, Katie.
You cannot imagine the speed.

584
00:47:49,122 --> 00:47:52,285
- She was like a winged bullet up there.
- What did she make?

585
00:47:52,458 --> 00:47:56,622
Oh, around 352.

586
00:48:03,603 --> 00:48:05,070
You did it!

587
00:48:06,406 --> 00:48:08,271
Fastest man on the planet.

588
00:48:08,441 --> 00:48:11,672
Hot dog! I'm so proud of you.

589
00:48:11,844 --> 00:48:13,835
- She did it, baby.
- You knew she would.

590
00:48:14,013 --> 00:48:16,982
Oh, she was fine. She was just fine.

591
00:48:18,184 --> 00:48:19,742
Now let me see your foot.

592
00:48:19,986 --> 00:48:21,283
Yeah.

593
00:48:21,988 --> 00:48:25,549
- Good God! You're covered in blood.
- Oh, no. That's just beet juice.

594
00:48:25,725 --> 00:48:27,886
- I crashed into a beet field.
- What?

595
00:48:28,061 --> 00:48:30,256
Yeah, I crashed in a beet field.

596
00:48:33,466 --> 00:48:35,559
Let me get you cleaned up.

597
00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:41,097
- Heavens, what is this? Electrical tape?
- Yeah. Odie just sort of slammed it on there.

598
00:48:42,141 --> 00:48:47,169
But all I could think about
was getting home to see you.

599
00:48:51,884 --> 00:48:54,751
I am so proud of you.

600
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:01,658
Now, this is gonna sting a little bit.

601
00:49:01,828 --> 00:49:05,628
Oh, this is useless.
Come to the bathroom.

602
00:49:06,866 --> 00:49:09,733
- Don't get beet juice on the carpet.
- I won't, I won't.

603
00:49:09,902 --> 00:49:12,564
- Too hot!
- Don't be a baby.

604
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,073
Was the press there?

605
00:49:18,011 --> 00:49:19,273
Some.

606
00:49:19,512 --> 00:49:24,609
But they're calling everyone.
Should be on the wires by now.

607
00:49:33,226 --> 00:49:34,784
What is it?

608
00:49:37,497 --> 00:49:39,089
Kate?

609
00:49:42,335 --> 00:49:45,429
I've been famous,
for better or worse...

610
00:49:45,972 --> 00:49:47,940
...for a long time now...

611
00:49:48,107 --> 00:49:52,441
...and I wonder if you know what it...

612
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:54,876
...really means.

613
00:49:56,049 --> 00:49:59,143
Yeah. I had my fair share
of press on <i>Hell's Angels.</i>

614
00:49:59,919 --> 00:50:01,716
I'm used to it.

615
00:50:03,656 --> 00:50:05,351
Are you?

616
00:50:09,028 --> 00:50:10,791
Howard, we're...

617
00:50:13,733 --> 00:50:16,167
We're not like everyone else.

618
00:50:18,171 --> 00:50:23,108
Too many acute angles.
Too many eccentricities.

619
00:50:23,876 --> 00:50:26,743
We have to be very careful not to...

620
00:50:28,047 --> 00:50:31,881
...let people in,
or they'll make us into freaks.

621
00:50:33,086 --> 00:50:37,648
Kate, they can't get in here.
We're safe.

622
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:41,258
They can always get in.

623
00:50:43,429 --> 00:50:46,830
When my brother killed himself...

624
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,560
...there were photographers
at the funeral.

625
00:50:51,804 --> 00:50:54,034
There's no decency to it.

626
00:51:06,486 --> 00:51:08,545
You know, sometimes I...

627
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:14,452
I get these feelings, Katie.

628
00:51:19,432 --> 00:51:21,992
I get these ideas, these...

629
00:51:24,837 --> 00:51:27,431
...crazy ideas about...

630
00:51:29,876 --> 00:51:32,242
...things that may not...

631
00:51:33,513 --> 00:51:36,380
Things that may not really be there.

632
00:51:37,049 --> 00:51:38,573
Yeah.

633
00:51:45,258 --> 00:51:48,022
Sometimes I truly fear that I'm...

634
00:51:50,062 --> 00:51:52,030
...losing my mind.

635
00:51:59,605 --> 00:52:01,470
And if I did, it would...

636
00:52:04,577 --> 00:52:06,943
It'd be like flying blind.

637
00:52:15,087 --> 00:52:16,748
You understand?

638
00:52:20,927 --> 00:52:23,725
You taught me to fly, Howard.

639
00:52:26,699 --> 00:52:28,690
I'll take the wheel.

640
00:52:44,617 --> 00:52:48,644
<i>Smashing all records, Howard Hughes</i>
<i>outdoes Jules Verne's wildest dreams.</i>

641
00:52:48,955 --> 00:52:52,220
<i>Around the world from New York</i>
<i>to New York in four days.</i>

642
00:52:52,391 --> 00:52:55,326
<i>Even beating Wiley Post's mark</i>
<i>by over three days.</i>

00:52:55,494 --> 00:52:58,725
<i>New aviation history is written</i>
<i>when his Lockheed monoplane...</i>

644
00:52:58,898 --> 00:53:01,890
<i>... returns swiftly and safely.</i>
<i>A daring aviator.</i>

645
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,997
<i>A true pioneer of the world's airways.</i>

646
00:53:05,171 --> 00:53:09,164
<i>From New York to Paris, he cuts Lindbergh's</i>

647
00:53:09,342 --> 00:53:13,904
<i>Thirty-five hours out of New York,</i>

652
00:53:35,201 --> 00:53:39,763
You won't believe this. It just came over the
wires. Hughes has bought control of TWA.

653
00:53:42,508 --> 00:53:45,375
I thought Mr. Hughes
was flying around the world.

654
00:53:45,578 --> 00:53:48,979
Apparently he did it while he was flying,
over the radio.

655
00:53:56,188 --> 00:53:59,487
I have heard some disquieting rumors
about Mr. Hughes.

656
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:04,496
I'd like to know everything
there is to know about Mr. Hughes.

657
00:54:06,932 --> 00:54:09,162
I'd like you to attend to that for me.

658
00:54:10,169 --> 00:54:11,796
Thoroughly.

659
00:54:12,371 --> 00:54:14,805
<i>The Pantages is glittering tonight.</i>

660
00:54:14,974 --> 00:54:17,807
- Howard!
- Right over here. This way, over to the left.

661
00:54:17,977 --> 00:54:20,639
- Mr. Hughes, how was your flight?
- Miss Hepburn!

662
00:54:20,813 --> 00:54:23,475
- When are you gonna name the day?
- Raise your head.

663
00:54:23,649 --> 00:54:25,776
What's the next movie?
Give us the scoop.

664
00:54:25,951 --> 00:54:28,647
Right here. How many more
records are you gonna set?

665
00:54:28,821 --> 00:54:32,120
Right over here. Come on.
Give us a smile. It won't kill you.

666
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:34,191
- Howard, this way.
- Beautiful.

667
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,851
Over here, over here, Mr. Hughes.

668
00:54:37,029 --> 00:54:39,463
When are you gonna fly
around the world again?

669
00:54:39,632 --> 00:54:43,625
You gonna fly with Kate next time?
Did you get lonely without her?

670
00:54:43,803 --> 00:54:47,864
- Talk to Lindbergh about your flight yet?
- Where's Linda Darnell tonight?

671
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,339
- Please, Mr. Hughes.
- Right here. Right here, Mr. Hughes.

672
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:54,001
Are you trying to be more famous
than Lindbergh?

673
00:54:54,714 --> 00:54:58,445
You know,
fame is supposed to be my turf.

674
00:55:00,686 --> 00:55:02,313
L. B!

675
00:55:04,957 --> 00:55:08,324
If you don't get more distinguished
every time I see you.

676
00:55:08,494 --> 00:55:10,519
You look so beautiful.

677
00:55:18,304 --> 00:55:19,931
Is that true?

678
00:55:28,748 --> 00:55:30,613
Don't worry about it, Howard.

679
00:55:30,783 --> 00:55:34,446
She's just working the room.
It's her job, baby.

680
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:41,290
<i>Sultry Southern tigress Ava Gardner</i>
<i>dazzles the room tonight.</i>

681
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:43,690
<i>She's the newest star</i>
<i>in the MGM galaxy.</i>

682
00:55:43,863 --> 00:55:47,492
<i>And believe you me,</i>
<i>she puts the "cheese" in "cheesecake."</i>

683
00:55:49,735 --> 00:55:55,264
Well, <i>Jane Eyre</i> has been selling popcorn
for over a hundred years, L.B.

684
00:56:36,015 --> 00:56:37,448
Hello.

685
00:56:39,084 --> 00:56:40,642
Hello.

686
00:56:45,858 --> 00:56:48,725
Could you reach me a towel?

687
00:56:56,168 --> 00:56:57,897
I...

688
00:56:59,038 --> 00:57:02,269
I really can't do that.

689
00:57:03,909 --> 00:57:05,433
I'm sorry.

690
00:57:30,269 --> 00:57:34,603
I'm an idiot. I'm a complete idiot,
and I'm sorry.

691
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:38,535
- Forget it.
- No, no. I'm a vain, preening ass...

692
00:57:38,711 --> 00:57:43,705
...without a single redeeming feature.
- That's not true. You have very good teeth.

693
00:57:44,216 --> 00:57:45,683
Come on.

694
00:57:46,552 --> 00:57:50,886
I've got a better idea. Take me flying.
Or better yet, I'll take you flying.

695
00:57:51,056 --> 00:57:52,785
Do your worst, Miss Hepburn.

696
00:58:01,901 --> 00:58:05,735
Don't be so squirmy. You're gonna
get on famously with Father and Mother.

697
00:58:05,905 --> 00:58:09,534
And I'm sure they'll like you too.
Once they get to know you.

698
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:20,648
- Hello! Hello!
- Kath, hello.

699
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:22,377
Kathy.

700
00:58:25,324 --> 00:58:29,055
- Who's that with the camera right there?
- That's my ex-husband, Ludlow.

701
00:58:29,228 --> 00:58:31,492
Father and Mother are just mad
about Luddie.

702
00:58:31,664 --> 00:58:35,998
- What the hell's he doing here?
- Oh, he's here all the time.

703
00:58:36,902 --> 00:58:38,529
Hello!

704
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:41,506
Sorry we're late.

705
00:58:41,674 --> 00:58:43,972
- Mom.
- Oh. Oh, thank you.

706
00:58:44,143 --> 00:58:45,770
- Dad.
- Darling.

707
00:58:45,945 --> 00:58:49,244
- Uncle Willy.
- Oh, who have we got here?

708
00:58:49,415 --> 00:58:52,145
- Don't feel self-conscious.
- Hepburns! Hepburns!

709
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:56,084
Attention, please. This is Howard.

710
00:58:56,355 --> 00:58:58,186
Howard, welcome.

711
00:58:59,525 --> 00:59:01,618
Don't worry, he's had his lunch.

712
00:59:03,262 --> 00:59:05,127
He likes you. That's unusual.

713
00:59:05,297 --> 00:59:08,630
We pay our devotion to the arts here.
A colony we created.

714
00:59:08,801 --> 00:59:12,760
Julian's a painter. Abstract, of course.
What's the point of painting...

715
00:59:12,938 --> 00:59:16,305
...something real when you can just
take a picture nowadays?

716
00:59:16,475 --> 00:59:18,943
Where do you stand on politics,
Mr. Hughes?

717
00:59:19,378 --> 00:59:21,903
- Excuse me?
- We're all socialists here.

718
00:59:22,081 --> 00:59:23,514
We are not.

719
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:27,344
You've met Mr. Roosevelt.
What make you of him?

720
00:59:30,556 --> 00:59:32,581
What are you sniggering at?

721
00:59:32,758 --> 00:59:35,124
- What? What was that?
- You just sniggered.

722
00:59:35,894 --> 00:59:38,886
No, no. The dog.
It seems to be crushing my feet.

723
00:59:39,064 --> 00:59:41,032
- Oh, my God!
- Buster!

724
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,428
Hey. Hey!

725
00:59:44,103 --> 00:59:45,570
Don't you like dogs?

726
00:59:45,738 --> 00:59:48,400
I will not have you sniggering
at Mr. Roosevelt.

727
00:59:48,574 --> 00:59:50,303
- Please leave.
- No. I wasn't.

728
00:59:50,476 --> 00:59:53,445
- I thought everybody liked dogs.
- Perhaps he had a bad experience.

729
00:59:53,612 --> 00:59:56,080
Does it upset you
that Howard gets more press?

730
00:59:56,248 --> 00:59:59,411
- A bad experience with a dog?
- No, no.

731
00:59:59,585 --> 01:00:04,147
- You are such a shy creature, aren't you?
- Perhaps it was a very large dog.

732
01:00:04,323 --> 01:00:08,089
- The press can be a damned nuisance.
- Was it a Doberman?

733
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:11,354
- A Doberman, Mr. Hughes? Or a dachshund?
- Neither, sir.

734
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:15,762
- Dachshunds are little dogs, Hep dear.
- They should all be lined up and shot.

735
01:00:15,934 --> 01:00:19,131
- What's that Spanish painting?
- The Goya.

736
01:00:19,304 --> 01:00:21,499
Goya. Of course. Yes.

737
01:00:22,141 --> 01:00:25,304
- Yes, Mexican.
- What was that called?

738
01:00:25,477 --> 01:00:29,607
Anyway, that's the vulgar press, I'm sure.
Do you read much, Mr. Hughes?

739
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:34,083
I try to stay up to snuff
on the trade journals, yeah.

740
01:00:34,253 --> 01:00:38,121
- Snuff?
- These would be flying magazines?

741
01:00:39,758 --> 01:00:42,192
- What was that?
- Oh, he's a little deaf.

742
01:00:42,361 --> 01:00:45,694
- Pass the goddamn butter, I beg you.
- You read flying magazines?

743
01:00:45,864 --> 01:00:48,924
Trade journals. On engineering. Aviation.

744
01:00:49,101 --> 01:00:50,830
We read books.

745
01:00:51,236 --> 01:00:55,502
Howard has to read the trade pieces, Mom,
because he's designing a new airplane.

746
01:00:55,674 --> 01:00:57,665
Oh, really? Do tell.

747
01:01:00,913 --> 01:01:02,437
Well...

748
01:01:04,183 --> 01:01:08,847
...it's quite exciting, actually.
It's a spy plane for the Air Corps.

749
01:01:09,021 --> 01:01:11,148
A twin-engine plane with some...

750
01:01:11,323 --> 01:01:14,315
...I must admit,
some rather unique design features.

751
01:01:14,493 --> 01:01:17,053
You see,
it has these two booms at the back...

752
01:01:17,229 --> 01:01:20,289
Luddie built a birdhouse once.
You remember that, dear?

753
01:01:20,566 --> 01:01:23,763
- Yes, well, a mere trifle, darling.
- I remember the painting!

754
01:01:23,936 --> 01:01:26,598
The painting, it's called
<i>May 18-0-</i> something.

755
01:01:26,772 --> 01:01:29,639
Anyway, Goya's vastly overrated.
All the Spaniards are.

756
01:01:29,808 --> 01:01:32,504
- Nonsense! Picasso is sacred.
- I'm a urologist.

757
01:01:32,678 --> 01:01:35,545
- It was quite aesthetic, really.
- A sacred monster.

758
01:01:35,714 --> 01:01:38,376
The birds don't care for it much,
but the bats do.

759
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:40,711
- I'll bet.
- That's such bunk!

760
01:01:40,886 --> 01:01:44,185
- Do speak up, dear.
- Nothing, nothing, Mrs. Hepburn. Nothing.

761
01:01:44,356 --> 01:01:48,224
Why did you speak? I can't abide people
who speak but have nothing to say.

762
01:01:48,393 --> 01:01:52,056
Did you go to mechanic school
to learn all this airplane guff?

763
01:01:52,231 --> 01:01:53,789
No, no, I didn't, Luddie. No.

764
01:01:53,966 --> 01:01:56,730
Well, Howard just flew round
the world in three days.

765
01:01:56,902 --> 01:01:59,837
- I think we've had enough about airplanes.
- And dogs.

766
01:02:00,005 --> 01:02:03,736
- Then how did you make all that money?
- We don't care about money here.

767
01:02:03,909 --> 01:02:05,877
Well, that's because you have it.

768
01:02:09,882 --> 01:02:11,213
Would you repeat that?

769
01:02:12,551 --> 01:02:15,486
You don't care about money
because you've always had it.

770
01:02:15,654 --> 01:02:18,623
- How did you make all that..?
- Excuse me, I'm speaking.

771
01:02:18,791 --> 01:02:20,019
- Okay.
- Thank you.

772
01:02:20,192 --> 01:02:21,659
All right.

773
01:02:22,094 --> 01:02:24,528
Some of us choose to work for a living.

774
01:02:24,696 --> 01:02:29,963
Speaking of which, I have more of that
airplane guff to attend to.

775
01:02:30,869 --> 01:02:32,427
Excuse me.

776
01:02:40,045 --> 01:02:42,707
Well, seems a rather high-strung chap.

777
01:02:43,148 --> 01:02:46,140
You're a fine bunch of bullies,
aren't you?

778
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:49,617
Have you talked to Mr. Mayer
about letting you do <i>Jane Eyre</i>?

779
01:02:49,788 --> 01:02:53,087
The old philistine won't budge.
Too arty, don't you know.

780
01:02:53,258 --> 01:02:58,195
I'm convinced the man hasn't read anything
longer than a <i>Katzenjammer Kids</i> in his life.

781
01:02:59,565 --> 01:03:03,023
No fair, kicking.
You have to use the mallet.

782
01:03:04,837 --> 01:03:08,568
Really, darling, you can't retire
from the field of battle like that...

783
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:12,198
...or they'll never respect you.
- Katie, I don't understand.

784
01:03:12,544 --> 01:03:15,012
You're like a different person in there.

785
01:03:15,781 --> 01:03:18,579
They just expect me to be a certain way.

786
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:24,785
There's only one real Kate,
and that's your Kate.

787
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:32,959
<i>Over in Hollywood, aviation tycoon</i>
<i>Howard Hughes is cooking up something big.</i>

788
01:03:33,131 --> 01:03:37,625
<i>Even as he edits his new picture, he's been</i>
<i>secretly meeting with the U.S. Air Corps.</i>

789
01:03:37,803 --> 01:03:41,364
<i>We applaud his patriotism and look forward</i>
<i>to his newest marvel.</i>

790
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:44,941
You know how many Allied ships we lost
because of U-boat attacks?

791
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:47,237
- No.
- Six hundred and eighty-one ships...

792
01:03:47,412 --> 01:03:52,008
...just this year so far. The Army needs
a new airplane to fly the troops to Europe.

793
01:03:52,184 --> 01:03:55,676
These ships, they're sitting ducks
for the U-boats.

794
01:03:55,854 --> 01:03:59,517
- You wanna build a troop-carrier plane?
- Stop thinking like an insect.

795
01:03:59,691 --> 01:04:02,626
Not just to carry troops,
a plane to carry everything.

796
01:04:02,794 --> 01:04:07,060
The troops and the jeeps and the tanks
and whatnot. Here, take a look.

797
01:04:08,467 --> 01:04:10,298
No. Other side.

798
01:04:13,238 --> 01:04:16,765
I figure around 200 feet from nose to tail.
Wingspan, around 300.

799
01:04:16,942 --> 01:04:19,502
We're gonna need
about 24,000 horsepower.

800
01:04:20,812 --> 01:04:23,906
Now, this is just what Kaiser
and the Army are looking for.

801
01:04:24,082 --> 01:04:27,574
- They're gonna pay for it this time.
- What are you getting us into?

802
01:04:27,753 --> 01:04:30,620
Well, it's a big plane,
so I'm calling it The Hercules.

803
01:04:31,123 --> 01:04:32,647
Swell name, isn't it?

804
01:04:33,091 --> 01:04:36,254
- How heavy you imagine this thing is?
- Say around 200 tons.

805
01:04:39,431 --> 01:04:41,922
Well, I didn't say it was gonna be easy.

806
01:04:42,401 --> 01:04:45,495
All right, boys,
I want you to rig up something like this.

807
01:04:45,671 --> 01:04:50,131
Should give the proper uplift ratios and
reduce need for torque support on the front.

808
01:04:50,309 --> 01:04:54,040
We are not getting enough production
out of Jane Russell's breasts.

809
01:04:54,212 --> 01:04:56,737
I want smooth titties, gentlemen.
Smooth titties.

810
01:04:59,551 --> 01:05:02,714
- It's all in engineering, isn't it, Odie?
- Howard...

811
01:05:03,221 --> 01:05:07,851
...do you really think they're gonna let you
put out a whole movie just about tits?

812
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:10,927
Sure. Who doesn't like tits?

813
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:24,605
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Sorry I'm late.

814
01:05:24,776 --> 01:05:28,303
Please record that Mr. Hughes has arrived
and this session is now called to order.

815
01:05:29,481 --> 01:05:32,245
- I yield the floor to Mr. Breen.
- Mr. Hughes...

816
01:05:32,417 --> 01:05:36,319
...members of the committee, I've reviewed
the photoplay entitled <i>The Outlaw...</i>

817
01:05:36,488 --> 01:05:40,219
...and I can state that I have never seen
anything so unacceptable...

818
01:05:40,392 --> 01:05:44,328
...as the shots of the mammaries
of the character named Rio.

819
01:05:44,696 --> 01:05:48,792
For almost half the picture,
the girl's mammaries, which are quite large...

820
01:05:48,967 --> 01:05:52,164
...and prominent,
are shockingly uncovered.

821
01:05:53,105 --> 01:05:57,371
For this reason, I concluded the picture
appeals only to prurient interests...

822
01:05:57,542 --> 01:06:02,070
...and should be denied the Motion Picture
Association's seal of approval.

823
01:06:02,714 --> 01:06:04,944
Really, Mr. Hughes.

824
01:06:05,117 --> 01:06:08,746
- Thank you, Mr. Breen. Mr. Hughes.
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

825
01:06:09,087 --> 01:06:11,248
Mr. Breen. It's good to see you again.

826
01:06:11,423 --> 01:06:15,553
I haven't seen you all since that situation
with all the violence in <i>Scarface.</i>

827
01:06:15,761 --> 01:06:18,889
The situation here revolves
around Miss Russell's mammaries.

828
01:06:19,064 --> 01:06:21,624
Mr. Breen feels that they are
too prominent, yes?

829
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:25,167
More prominent than other mammaries
have been up on the screen?

830
01:06:25,337 --> 01:06:27,965
Well, I hope to dispel that notion.

831
01:06:31,476 --> 01:06:32,909
Jean Harlow.

832
01:06:34,846 --> 01:06:36,473
Ann Sheridan.

833
01:06:37,916 --> 01:06:39,349
Irene Dunne.

834
01:06:39,518 --> 01:06:41,145
Claudette Colbert.

835
01:06:41,753 --> 01:06:43,448
Rita Hayworth.

836
01:06:43,855 --> 01:06:48,189
Betty Grable.
And the lovely Miss Jane Russell.

837
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:52,729
Now, all these shots, save for Miss Russell,
were enlarged from pictures...

838
01:06:52,898 --> 01:06:56,163
...that received
Mr. Breen's seal of approval.

839
01:06:56,802 --> 01:07:01,899
Now, as you've probably noticed by now,
they all contain mammaries.

840
01:07:02,874 --> 01:07:05,900
I will ask my associate to join me now.
May I introduce...

841
01:07:06,078 --> 01:07:09,775
...Dr. Ludlow Branson
of Columbia University.

842
01:07:11,216 --> 01:07:13,081
Dr. Branson...

843
01:07:13,685 --> 01:07:17,143
...is a mathematician of some note.

844
01:07:17,322 --> 01:07:19,813
Yes. And he will now demonstrate...

845
01:07:19,991 --> 01:07:21,720
...that in fact...

846
01:07:21,893 --> 01:07:25,420
...Miss Russell's mammaries
are no more prominent...

847
01:07:25,597 --> 01:07:28,395
...than any of these other fine ladies'.

848
01:07:30,936 --> 01:07:32,198
Doctor.

849
01:07:33,705 --> 01:07:35,297
Doctor...

850
01:07:36,174 --> 01:07:38,438
...you forgot your calipers.

851
01:07:45,217 --> 01:07:48,448
Gentlemen, Mr. Hughes.

852
01:07:51,189 --> 01:07:53,714
Let us commence by calling this...

853
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:56,857
...Mammary Exhibit Number One.

854
01:07:57,028 --> 01:08:02,796
Now, you'll see that the length
of the actual cleavage...

855
01:08:03,535 --> 01:08:06,732
...if I may, is...

856
01:08:07,772 --> 01:08:09,967
...5 inches and a quarter.

857
01:08:10,342 --> 01:08:11,707
Now if we move to Mammary Exhibit...

858
01:08:11,877 --> 01:08:13,344
<i>Dateline: Hollywoodland.</i>

859
01:08:13,512 --> 01:08:17,004
<i>Movie tycoon Howard Hughes</i>
<i>must have the greatest job in the land.</i>

860
01:08:17,182 --> 01:08:20,618
<i>Every night, the lucky guy escorts</i>
<i>a different beautiful woman...</i>

861
01:08:20,785 --> 01:08:22,719
<i>... to a different dazzling event.</i>

862
01:08:22,888 --> 01:08:27,552
<i>The TWA king always talks up</i>
<i>his airline as he escorts a succession...</i>

863
01:08:29,861 --> 01:08:31,988
<i>The Hercules, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

864
01:08:32,164 --> 01:08:33,631
<i>The Hercules.</i>

865
01:08:33,798 --> 01:08:37,734
<i>A plane, a boat, a flying city.</i>

866
01:08:37,903 --> 01:08:41,361
Don't forget, every bill comes to me.
They don't pay for anything.

867
01:08:41,540 --> 01:08:44,976
Those men decide whether to fund
the plane, so I need them happy.

868
01:08:45,343 --> 01:08:47,607
- You do what it takes.
- You betcha, boss.

869
01:08:48,013 --> 01:08:50,311
How are the girls
in the bomb department?

870
01:08:50,482 --> 01:08:54,316
Well, let's put it this way,
it'll be a regular boob buffet.

871
01:08:54,486 --> 01:08:57,580
I don't think the Air Corps men
will have trouble scoring.

872
01:08:57,756 --> 01:09:01,419
- Good.
<i>- And inside, 700 brave American soldiers...</i>

873
01:09:01,593 --> 01:09:06,087
<i>... a dozen Sherman tanks all winging</i>
<i>their way over the Atlantic...</i>

874
01:09:06,264 --> 01:09:08,698
<i>... free from the threats</i>
<i>of the U-boats below.</i>

875
01:09:08,867 --> 01:09:13,201
<i>Could Jules Verne himself have</i>
<i>ever imagined anything so magnificent?</i>

876
01:09:13,371 --> 01:09:17,307
<i>Could he have imagined her mammoth</i>
<i>wingspan, longer than a football field?</i>

877
01:09:17,576 --> 01:09:19,305
Don't you see how this demeans me?

878
01:09:19,477 --> 01:09:21,809
Since when do you care
about scandal rags?

879
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:25,279
Every time there's a picture of you with
another woman, it's a slap in the face.

880
01:09:25,450 --> 01:09:28,419
- Don't you understand that?
- Well, that's overstating it.

881
01:09:28,587 --> 01:09:31,920
Joan Crawford, Ginger Rogers,
Linda Darnell, Joan Fontaine...

882
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:34,991
...and now Bette Davis,
for God's sake.

883
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:42,026
Look, they're Cracker Jack candy, honey.
They don't mean anything to me.

884
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,169
Oh, very nice.

885
01:09:46,838 --> 01:09:49,739
You're the one that said
that all men are predators.

886
01:09:49,908 --> 01:09:52,809
I mean, it's all in Darwin, remember?

887
01:09:53,144 --> 01:09:56,739
And am I to expect this behavior
to continue after the wedding?

888
01:09:56,915 --> 01:09:58,974
What is really bothering you, Kate?

889
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:02,415
Is it the women or the publicity?

890
01:10:07,659 --> 01:10:11,891
Can't you eat ice cream from a bowl
like everyone else in the world?

891
01:10:19,004 --> 01:10:22,565
Don't you dare.

892
01:10:34,252 --> 01:10:35,514
Yeah.

893
01:10:36,688 --> 01:10:40,283
No, Odie, this is not a good time.

894
01:10:40,525 --> 01:10:44,689
For chrissakes, we can't make The Hercules
if we don't have any aluminum.

895
01:10:44,863 --> 01:10:46,455
Wait.

896
01:10:46,631 --> 01:10:49,691
I can hear you better now.
Tell the War Production Board...

897
01:10:49,868 --> 01:10:53,065
...that this is an essential
strategic operation.

898
01:10:53,238 --> 01:10:57,800
If they're giving aluminum to Boeing,
they can give some to Hughes Aircraft.

899
01:10:57,976 --> 01:11:00,945
Don't set the ice cream...

900
01:11:01,112 --> 01:11:05,481
We gotta think of something else. If we
can't get aluminum, we'll find another way.

901
01:11:05,917 --> 01:11:09,250
You tell me. We'll find
some alloy that works just as well.

902
01:11:09,521 --> 01:11:12,149
Right. Look...

903
01:11:12,324 --> 01:11:16,454
- lf we can't get aluminum, we'll use wood.
- You can't make a plane out of wood.

904
01:11:16,628 --> 01:11:19,153
Why not?
The damn thing is a flying boat, right?

905
01:11:19,331 --> 01:11:21,299
- What do they use to make boats?
- Oak.

906
01:11:21,466 --> 01:11:24,401
And think of The Hercules
like a flying Spanish galleon.

907
01:11:24,569 --> 01:11:27,367
Spanish galleons
can weigh 1200 tons.

908
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,070
Good luck today.

909
01:11:30,608 --> 01:11:33,941
We just have to find the right wood.
Something light but strong.

910
01:11:34,112 --> 01:11:36,910
- Morning, Kate.
- Pine, cedar, maybe birch.

911
01:11:47,425 --> 01:11:49,017
Catch.

912
01:11:52,931 --> 01:11:54,728
From my farm.

913
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,894
If you like it, I can get you a bushel.

914
01:12:10,715 --> 01:12:13,149
Trouble with Mr. Hughes?

915
01:12:18,556 --> 01:12:22,993
There's too much Howard Hughes
in Howard Hughes.

916
01:12:24,829 --> 01:12:26,854
That's the trouble.

917
01:12:40,011 --> 01:12:41,808
Beautiful.

918
01:12:43,782 --> 01:12:45,181
Don't you take Christmas off?

919
01:12:46,518 --> 01:12:49,282
Nice to see you.
Sorry, I've got grease on my hands.

920
01:12:49,454 --> 01:12:51,979
Have we got something to show you.

921
01:12:56,361 --> 01:13:01,094
Take a look. The XF-11
reconnaissance flier. Spy plane, really.

922
01:13:02,033 --> 01:13:04,729
Designed every inch of her myself.

923
01:13:04,903 --> 01:13:06,894
She's got a top speed of 450...

924
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:09,904
...which means she can outrun
anything they throw against her.

925
01:13:10,074 --> 01:13:13,168
After the Japs stole
my H-1 design for their Zeros...

926
01:13:13,344 --> 01:13:15,505
...I needed to do them one better.

927
01:13:16,614 --> 01:13:19,742
Yeah, she's my Buck Rogers ship.

928
01:13:19,918 --> 01:13:21,943
She's a looker.

929
01:13:22,587 --> 01:13:24,214
Okay, what do you got for me?

930
01:13:31,663 --> 01:13:33,893
Jiminy Cricket.

931
01:13:34,065 --> 01:13:37,728
Seating capacity for 60.
Wingspan, 123 feet.

932
01:13:37,902 --> 01:13:41,269
Four Double Cyclone engines.
Her ceiling's 25,000 feet.

933
01:13:41,439 --> 01:13:44,670
- Gross weight?
- 86,000, wing loading of 41 pounds.

934
01:13:44,843 --> 01:13:47,641
So less drag on the plane in thinner air.

935
01:13:47,812 --> 01:13:51,270
So high-cruise power, you're looking
at a top speed of around 340.

936
01:13:52,350 --> 01:13:55,911
Giving her a range of about 3000 miles.

937
01:13:57,088 --> 01:13:59,579
- Cross-country.
- Nonstop.

938
01:14:00,892 --> 01:14:02,450
Bob...

939
01:14:02,627 --> 01:14:05,790
...you know something?
You are a son of a bitch.

940
01:14:16,741 --> 01:14:20,233
Yeah. Bob, you got
something on your suit.

941
01:14:21,813 --> 01:14:23,280
Yeah.

942
01:14:23,648 --> 01:14:26,139
On your lapel.
You got something on your lapel.

943
01:14:29,287 --> 01:14:31,152
Right there, Bob.

944
01:14:32,924 --> 01:14:34,482
You missed it. Right there.

945
01:14:36,794 --> 01:14:38,659
Clean it off, would you?

946
01:14:38,830 --> 01:14:41,321
Here. Thanks.

947
01:14:44,602 --> 01:14:46,035
No, throw it away.

948
01:14:50,074 --> 01:14:51,473
No, over there.

949
01:14:57,982 --> 01:15:01,816
Thanks. So, what do you call her?

950
01:15:01,986 --> 01:15:04,147
The Constellation,
but we can change that.

951
01:15:04,322 --> 01:15:05,949
No, no.

952
01:15:06,124 --> 01:15:09,150
It's pretty. I like her.

953
01:15:10,128 --> 01:15:12,221
So, what kind of deal can you give me?

954
01:15:12,397 --> 01:15:14,194
What kind of deal can you give me?

955
01:15:14,365 --> 01:15:16,663
The first 40 planes off the assembly line.

956
01:15:16,834 --> 01:15:19,359
That should give us about
two years' exclusivity.

957
01:15:19,537 --> 01:15:20,834
Hell, more than that.

958
01:15:21,005 --> 01:15:24,998
United and American don't have
the imagination for a plane like this.

959
01:15:25,176 --> 01:15:27,770
Two years ahead of Juan Trippe, then.

960
01:15:32,817 --> 01:15:34,079
How much?

961
01:15:34,252 --> 01:15:36,413
Four hundred and fifty thousand each.

962
01:15:37,221 --> 01:15:40,088
So that's 18 million for the first 40.

963
01:15:41,025 --> 01:15:44,085
Hell, TWA can't afford that.
The damn airline's flat broke.

964
01:15:48,266 --> 01:15:50,734
Guess I'll just have
to pay for them myself.

965
01:15:51,636 --> 01:15:54,696
Build them, Bob.
Send the bill to Noah Dietrich.

966
01:15:54,872 --> 01:15:56,396
Oh, and thank you.

967
01:16:00,178 --> 01:16:02,009
Merry Christmas.

968
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:06,640
<i>You've just placed the largest order for</i>
<i>airplanes in the history of the damn planet.</i>

969
01:16:06,818 --> 01:16:08,945
<i>Lockheed sent us a bill for $18 million.</i>

970
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:12,385
Don't get all hysterical on me, Noah.
It isn't good for you.

971
01:16:12,557 --> 01:16:15,890
<i>- This is a lot of money for planes.</i>
- I know it's a lot of money.

972
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:19,689
<i>It's too damn much. You think I've got</i>
<i>$18 million in petty cash?</i>

973
01:16:19,864 --> 01:16:22,025
I should've told you. It slipped my mind.

974
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,100
<i>- Slipped your mind? Oh, for...</i>
- Right.

975
01:16:24,268 --> 01:16:27,726
- I'll get back to you. Bye.
<i>- How could $18 million slip your mind?</i>

976
01:16:28,606 --> 01:16:31,769
Hey, honey.
What are you doing home?

977
01:16:36,214 --> 01:16:39,047
You're not one for tears, and, well...

978
01:16:39,217 --> 01:16:43,483
...neither am I,
so it's best to come out with it.

979
01:16:46,591 --> 01:16:50,823
I've met someone.
I've fallen in love and I'm moving out.

980
01:16:53,431 --> 01:16:58,198
If I could make it
any more gentle, I would.

981
01:16:58,369 --> 01:17:02,430
But I can't, so...

982
01:17:03,474 --> 01:17:05,374
...there we both are.

983
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:10,811
Let's be honest.

984
01:17:10,982 --> 01:17:15,476
It's all been a grand adventure,
but it couldn't possibly last.

985
01:17:15,653 --> 01:17:18,554
We're too alike, you and I.

986
01:17:21,693 --> 01:17:22,990
You met someone?

987
01:17:23,161 --> 01:17:27,097
Someone more appropriate.
To me, I mean.

988
01:17:29,801 --> 01:17:32,770
What does that mean,
"more appropriate"?

989
01:17:33,171 --> 01:17:37,267
Someone more attuned to my needs.

990
01:17:37,809 --> 01:17:39,743
Look at me, Katie.

991
01:17:39,911 --> 01:17:41,811
Stop acting.

992
01:17:42,246 --> 01:17:45,044
I'm not acting.

993
01:17:49,654 --> 01:17:52,282
I wonder if you even know anymore.

994
01:17:57,195 --> 01:17:59,425
Don't be unkind.

995
01:18:02,133 --> 01:18:03,828
You?

996
01:18:05,169 --> 01:18:06,500
You wanna go?

997
01:18:10,141 --> 01:18:11,768
Go on.

998
01:18:12,343 --> 01:18:15,471
Actresses are cheap in this town, darling.

999
01:18:15,646 --> 01:18:18,240
- And I got a lot of money.
- This is beneath you.

1000
01:18:18,416 --> 01:18:20,850
No, no, this is exactly me.

1001
01:18:21,018 --> 01:18:26,149
You tell me you're leaving me, and you
have the nerve to expect graciousness?

1002
01:18:26,624 --> 01:18:28,615
I expect a little maturity.

1003
01:18:28,793 --> 01:18:31,694
I expect you to face the situation
like an adult who...

1004
01:18:31,863 --> 01:18:34,161
Don't talk down to me!

1005
01:18:34,332 --> 01:18:37,324
Don't you ever talk down to me!
You are a movie star.

1006
01:18:37,502 --> 01:18:39,060
Nothing more.

1007
01:19:51,108 --> 01:19:53,042
<i>Don't answer it.</i>

1008
01:19:55,913 --> 01:19:57,608
What is it, Howard?

1009
01:19:57,782 --> 01:20:00,080
<i>Hey, Noah...</i>

1010
01:20:00,251 --> 01:20:03,243
...I need you to get to Penney's
and buy me some clothes.

1011
01:20:03,421 --> 01:20:05,218
- Penney's isn't open.
- Oh, shit.

1012
01:20:05,389 --> 01:20:08,324
- It's 2 in the morning.
- Yeah, that's right.

1013
01:20:08,492 --> 01:20:11,222
Well, first thing tomorrow, then, all right?

1014
01:20:11,395 --> 01:20:14,455
I need two new suits off the rack.
One light and one dark.

1015
01:20:14,632 --> 01:20:17,863
Three white shirts and three pairs
of white tennis shoes. Got that?

1016
01:20:18,035 --> 01:20:19,969
- Yeah.
- No, no.

1017
01:20:20,137 --> 01:20:21,968
- Make it Woolworth's.
- Woolworth's.

1018
01:20:22,139 --> 01:20:24,733
No, no, Penney's. Penney's.

1019
01:20:24,909 --> 01:20:26,638
All right.

1020
01:20:27,345 --> 01:20:30,143
I'll get into it as soon as I can, Howard.

1021
01:20:30,481 --> 01:20:33,041
- All right?
- Noah, do you have a recorder?

1022
01:20:33,751 --> 01:20:36,948
- No.
- Are you recording this conversation?

1023
01:20:37,121 --> 01:20:39,521
- No.
- Okay.

1024
01:20:39,690 --> 01:20:41,521
I trust you.

1025
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:45,927
- Howard...
- I need those suits first thing tomorrow.

1026
01:20:46,097 --> 01:20:49,555
- All right.
- Wait. Did I say Penney's or Woolworth's?

1027
01:20:49,734 --> 01:20:52,362
- Penney's.
- Better make it Sears.

1028
01:20:52,536 --> 01:20:55,027
All right, then, Sears.

1029
01:20:57,909 --> 01:21:00,070
I'm sorry, honey.

1030
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:03,543
If I don't answer, he'll just call back.

1031
01:21:25,436 --> 01:21:28,462
Stop there, if you please, Miss Domergue.

1032
01:21:34,345 --> 01:21:36,245
Have you had surgery, Miss Domergue?

1033
01:21:38,115 --> 01:21:39,582
No.

1034
01:21:40,418 --> 01:21:43,512
Do you have scars of any kind?

1035
01:21:44,922 --> 01:21:46,446
No.

1036
01:21:48,092 --> 01:21:50,219
Wipe off your lipstick.

1037
01:21:54,799 --> 01:21:56,061
That's much better.

1038
01:21:57,668 --> 01:22:02,571
Now, you understand that you'd be
under contract to me? Personally.

1039
01:22:03,507 --> 01:22:05,634
Do you know what that means?

1040
01:22:13,985 --> 01:22:15,748
Now turn around for me.

1041
01:22:24,028 --> 01:22:25,518
Very nice.

1042
01:22:26,664 --> 01:22:28,529
You move well.

1043
01:22:31,369 --> 01:22:33,337
You live with your family, do you?

1044
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:37,031
Yes.

1045
01:22:37,508 --> 01:22:39,032
That's nice.

1046
01:22:40,378 --> 01:22:42,141
Tell me something.

1047
01:22:43,514 --> 01:22:45,914
How old are you, Miss Domergue?

1048
01:22:48,886 --> 01:22:50,649
Fifteen.

1049
01:22:54,058 --> 01:22:55,218
Holy Mother of God.

1050
01:23:14,644 --> 01:23:18,444
Well, a car picks me up
every morning at 8, and off I go.

1051
01:23:18,614 --> 01:23:21,640
I'm getting my high school diploma.

1052
01:23:21,818 --> 01:23:24,514
Howard thinks that education is important.

1053
01:23:24,687 --> 01:23:27,087
- That's right.
- And then, after classes...

1054
01:23:27,256 --> 01:23:30,817
...I'm off for elocution
and grooming and fittings.

1055
01:23:30,993 --> 01:23:32,790
Well, blow me down.

1056
01:23:33,996 --> 01:23:36,226
Pan Am's working
out of the Cocoanut Grove?

1057
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:38,333
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello, Juan.

1058
01:23:38,501 --> 01:23:40,230
Helen, good to see you.

1059
01:23:40,403 --> 01:23:42,894
- How are you, Howard?
- Good, thanks.

1060
01:23:43,072 --> 01:23:44,869
- This is Faith Domergue.
- Sit down.

1061
01:23:45,041 --> 01:23:46,906
- Pleasure.
- What are you doing here?

1062
01:23:47,076 --> 01:23:49,874
Well, I'm out to meet
with Douglas about the DC-4.

1063
01:23:50,046 --> 01:23:53,914
It's our new plane, and it is
gonna be a pip, let me tell you.

1064
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:57,280
- How's the Constellation coming?
- Good.

1065
01:23:57,587 --> 01:23:58,849
Great.

1066
01:24:00,256 --> 01:24:02,747
So how about letting me steal a peek?

1067
01:24:04,727 --> 01:24:06,695
I don't think so.

1068
01:24:06,863 --> 01:24:09,889
I should be cross with you.
You stole Ray Loewy from us.

1069
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:14,227
- He's doing our interior design. That's right.
- He was doing ours.

1070
01:24:16,739 --> 01:24:18,502
So...

1071
01:24:19,041 --> 01:24:21,509
...what are your colors?
- Stop fishing.

1072
01:24:23,246 --> 01:24:25,737
So you have buttons...

1073
01:24:25,915 --> 01:24:27,348
...or zippers?

1074
01:24:27,783 --> 01:24:29,045
I'm sorry?

1075
01:24:30,987 --> 01:24:34,889
Buttons or zippers for the drapes
on the sleeping berths?

1076
01:24:38,394 --> 01:24:40,055
Zippers.

1077
01:24:48,971 --> 01:24:50,529
Buttons.

1078
01:25:00,216 --> 01:25:03,208
So I suppose you'll be
expanding on down to Mexico.

1079
01:25:03,719 --> 01:25:07,246
- Why do you say that?
- Well, your range is 3000 miles.

1080
01:25:07,423 --> 01:25:11,519
I'd imagine you'd expand from Los Angeles
to Mexico and South America.

1081
01:25:11,694 --> 01:25:13,855
Hey, that's a good idea.
Anyone got a pen?

1082
01:25:14,030 --> 01:25:16,157
Or across the Atlantic.

1083
01:25:19,168 --> 01:25:21,068
You've had enough of this ice cream.

1084
01:25:21,237 --> 01:25:24,798
You give me that spoon. You don't
wanna get your gloves all sticky.

1085
01:25:26,776 --> 01:25:28,641
Isn't that too far?

1086
01:25:33,683 --> 01:25:35,583
New York...

1087
01:25:35,751 --> 01:25:37,776
...to Newfoundland...

1088
01:25:38,487 --> 01:25:39,749
...to Ireland.

1089
01:25:44,994 --> 01:25:46,586
To Paris.

1090
01:25:53,736 --> 01:25:55,363
Well...

1091
01:25:55,905 --> 01:25:57,998
...Pan Am welcomes you.

1092
01:25:58,174 --> 01:26:00,005
We're overbooked as it is.

1093
01:26:00,176 --> 01:26:03,805
It's such a burden doing it all
on your own, let me tell you.

1094
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:06,039
So when's the Connie gonna be ready?

1095
01:26:06,215 --> 01:26:08,843
- Next year maybe. DC-4?
- Next year.

1096
01:26:09,018 --> 01:26:12,181
Well, we look forward to her then.

1097
01:26:12,755 --> 01:26:14,484
And I to the Connie.

1098
01:26:16,359 --> 01:26:19,988
I've ordered the next 40 after you.

1099
01:26:20,229 --> 01:26:21,992
- It's Miss?
- Domergue.

1100
01:26:22,164 --> 01:26:25,531
Yes, of course. Now, was that a
rumba or a samba you were doing?

1101
01:26:25,968 --> 01:26:28,698
- It was a samba.
- A samba, yes.

1102
01:26:28,871 --> 01:26:32,136
Howard, I never knew
you were such a good dancer.

1103
01:26:33,109 --> 01:26:34,940
Helen, Jack.

1104
01:26:36,779 --> 01:26:39,577
Good going. You gave away
our entire postwar strategy.

1105
01:26:39,749 --> 01:26:44,209
- He can't stop us.
- He's Pan Am. He can stop anything.

1106
01:26:46,255 --> 01:26:48,052
Give me the largest
Scotch you got.

1107
01:26:48,224 --> 01:26:51,819
I don't know what in the hell you're
so damn giddy about. Excuse me.

1108
01:28:43,906 --> 01:28:45,339
Jack.

1109
01:28:45,508 --> 01:28:49,137
Get in touch with Joyce and Berg.
Those are my boys in Washington.

1110
01:28:49,311 --> 01:28:52,712
Set up a meeting with Jones,
secretary of commerce, old golfing buddy.

1111
01:28:52,882 --> 01:28:55,817
- Slow down.
- We'll need terminals in Ireland and France.

1112
01:28:55,985 --> 01:28:57,452
I wanna get some tax breaks.

1113
01:28:57,620 --> 01:29:01,283
If that ass thinks he owns the world,
he's got another thing coming.

1114
01:29:01,457 --> 01:29:04,324
Pan Am owns Europe.
We ought to think about Mexico.

1115
01:29:04,493 --> 01:29:08,589
To hell with Mexico. No airline should
have a monopoly on flying the Atlantic.

1116
01:29:08,764 --> 01:29:12,063
It just isn't fair.
He owns Pan Am, he owns Congress.

1117
01:29:12,234 --> 01:29:16,068
He owns the Civil Aeronautics Board,
but he does not own the sky.

1118
01:29:16,238 --> 01:29:18,866
We're in a street fight
with that son of a bitch.

1119
01:29:19,041 --> 01:29:22,704
I've been fighting high-hat
Ivy League pricks like him my whole life.

1120
01:29:22,878 --> 01:29:26,507
And listen, fire Ray Loewy.
You goddamn heard me? Fire Ray Loewy.

1121
01:29:26,682 --> 01:29:30,083
He's spying for Trippe.
That shitheel knew all about the buttons.

1122
01:29:30,252 --> 01:29:32,220
Spies in my midst, Jack.

1123
01:29:32,922 --> 01:29:34,719
Spies in my midst.

1124
01:29:49,171 --> 01:29:52,072
- Hello, Howard.
- Roland.

1125
01:29:53,976 --> 01:29:55,534
So...

1126
01:29:55,711 --> 01:29:57,235
...what can I do for you?

1127
01:30:00,449 --> 01:30:04,442
I want all the pictures you have
of Kate Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.

1128
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:08,147
All the negatives.
And I want you to kill the story.

1129
01:30:08,324 --> 01:30:11,691
Howard, he's a married man.
He's a Catholic.

1130
01:30:11,861 --> 01:30:14,125
They're movie stars.
Fair game all around.

1131
01:30:22,605 --> 01:30:24,766
My office knows where I am, Howard.

1132
01:30:25,808 --> 01:30:28,606
I'm not gonna kill you, Roland.

1133
01:30:28,777 --> 01:30:30,711
I don't do that.

1134
01:30:35,451 --> 01:30:38,079
- How much?
- Not for sale.

1135
01:30:41,357 --> 01:30:42,915
How much?

1136
01:30:43,792 --> 01:30:46,955
Not for sale.

1137
01:30:50,299 --> 01:30:52,392
You ever cheat on your wife, Roland?

1138
01:30:54,203 --> 01:30:56,637
You ever screw a colored girl?

1139
01:30:57,339 --> 01:31:00,502
You ever steal anything?
You ever hurt anyone?

1140
01:31:02,645 --> 01:31:04,476
Good night, Howard.

1141
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,849
You ever go to
a Communist Party meeting, Roland?

1142
01:31:17,693 --> 01:31:19,820
TWA stock.

1143
01:31:20,863 --> 01:31:22,125
How much?

1144
01:31:23,732 --> 01:31:25,199
Fifty thousand shares.

1145
01:31:25,834 --> 01:31:27,301
Ten.

1146
01:31:30,372 --> 01:31:31,703
All right.

1147
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:36,641
This isn't gonna be that easy.

1148
01:31:37,012 --> 01:31:40,413
He's been making big contributions
on both sides of the aisle.

1149
01:31:40,583 --> 01:31:44,019
And Jack Frye is out there
lobbying everybody in town.

1150
01:31:44,186 --> 01:31:47,349
The French and British ambassadors
are lined up on his side.

1151
01:31:48,691 --> 01:31:51,854
I'm telling you, TWA is serious
about going international.

1152
01:31:52,027 --> 01:31:53,654
Okay.

1153
01:31:53,829 --> 01:31:55,763
Point, Mr. Hughes.

1154
01:31:56,131 --> 01:31:59,794
I think it's time for you to introduce
the community airline bill...

1155
01:31:59,969 --> 01:32:01,493
...on the floor of the Senate.

1156
01:32:02,504 --> 01:32:05,302
- Is it done?
- My people are finishing it right now.

1157
01:32:05,474 --> 01:32:10,002
I also have to get you on the committee
investigating the national defense.

1158
01:32:12,448 --> 01:32:15,508
On the committee or chairman?

1159
01:32:15,851 --> 01:32:18,513
I could be much more effective
as chairman.

1160
01:32:18,687 --> 01:32:22,453
It's a great public platform.
You know, it generates a lot of press.

1161
01:32:22,625 --> 01:32:26,083
- Wasn't Truman chairman of that committee?
- Yeah, right.

1162
01:32:26,261 --> 01:32:28,661
He's vice president.
Look what he did with it.

1163
01:32:28,831 --> 01:32:30,890
No, I think...

1164
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,534
I think chairman.

1165
01:32:34,203 --> 01:32:35,636
What do you think?

1166
01:32:37,673 --> 01:32:40,233
- Chairman. That is interesting.
- Yeah.

1167
01:32:40,409 --> 01:32:43,901
Let me show you
these specs for the DC-4.

1168
01:32:44,179 --> 01:32:47,637
Ava, what do you think about
Trans World Airlines?

1169
01:32:47,816 --> 01:32:50,341
Transcontinental and Western
doesn't fit anymore.

1170
01:32:50,519 --> 01:32:53,386
We're international,
we need a name that reflects that.

1171
01:32:53,555 --> 01:32:56,251
Trans World is good. Kind of peppy.

1172
01:32:56,425 --> 01:32:58,950
TWA, right?

1173
01:32:59,128 --> 01:33:01,892
That way you don't need
to repaint any of the planes.

1174
01:33:02,064 --> 01:33:04,225
That's you. Always pinching pennies.

1175
01:33:05,401 --> 01:33:07,392
Hand me my wrap.

1176
01:33:21,417 --> 01:33:23,578
Knock it off.

1177
01:33:29,792 --> 01:33:32,317
I have something for you.

1178
01:33:33,562 --> 01:33:35,393
Stay here.

1179
01:33:40,869 --> 01:33:43,531
- What the hell is this?
- It's a present.

1180
01:33:43,706 --> 01:33:45,606
Go on, open it.

1181
01:33:46,775 --> 01:33:50,233
Oh, a box of trash.
You shouldn't have.

1182
01:33:50,412 --> 01:33:52,107
Keep looking, keep looking.

1183
01:33:56,952 --> 01:33:59,011
It's a Kashmiri sapphire.

1184
01:33:59,188 --> 01:34:02,316
I had my boys all over
the damn globe looking for this.

1185
01:34:02,491 --> 01:34:03,753
Why?

1186
01:34:03,926 --> 01:34:05,188
Because.

1187
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,987
Look.

1188
01:34:07,162 --> 01:34:09,221
It matches your eyes.

1189
01:34:09,398 --> 01:34:11,764
I am not for sale.

1190
01:34:11,934 --> 01:34:13,993
For chrissakes, it's just a present.

1191
01:34:14,169 --> 01:34:17,366
You can't buy me, Howard,
so stop trying.

1192
01:34:17,539 --> 01:34:21,100
Don't buy me any more diamonds
or sapphires or any other damn thing.

1193
01:34:21,276 --> 01:34:23,710
You can buy me dinner.
How about that?

1194
01:34:24,446 --> 01:34:25,708
Jesus, Ava.

1195
01:34:26,749 --> 01:34:29,809
It's bad enough I have to endure
those gym shoes of yours.

1196
01:34:29,985 --> 01:34:33,648
But I get all dolled up and we go out
in this jalopy without a hood.

1197
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:38,218
Ava, will you marry me?

1198
01:34:38,393 --> 01:34:41,089
- No, Howard.
- Well, why not, for heaven's sake?

1199
01:34:41,263 --> 01:34:43,823
In the first place, I don't love you.

1200
01:34:43,999 --> 01:34:46,365
In the second place, I'm still married.

1201
01:34:46,535 --> 01:34:51,234
Look, you got girls stashed all over town.
You got a damn harem just at the Bel-Air.

1202
01:34:51,406 --> 01:34:53,340
Marry one of your bungalow girls.

1203
01:34:53,509 --> 01:34:57,309
Those are employees. I won't marry
an employee. How would that look?

1204
01:35:05,487 --> 01:35:06,749
What is going on?

1205
01:35:10,058 --> 01:35:12,686
- Oh, my God!
- Goddamn it!

1206
01:35:14,329 --> 01:35:15,591
Faith!

1207
01:35:16,365 --> 01:35:18,299
- Faith, what the hell?
- Look out!

1208
01:35:18,467 --> 01:35:21,163
Goddamn, what the hell are you doing?

1209
01:35:24,339 --> 01:35:27,103
- Are you okay, lady?
- What are you doing with her?

1210
01:35:27,276 --> 01:35:29,938
We are going to dinner.
Now, get out of there.

1211
01:35:30,112 --> 01:35:32,103
Get that crazy bitch away from me!

1212
01:35:32,281 --> 01:35:33,873
Don't you love me anymore?

1213
01:35:34,049 --> 01:35:35,607
Course I love you, pork chop.

1214
01:35:35,784 --> 01:35:37,547
Ava, look over here. Howard.

1215
01:35:38,287 --> 01:35:39,549
Hey.

1216
01:35:42,991 --> 01:35:45,619
<i>Juan Trippe is working</i>
<i>with Senator Brewster now.</i>

1217
01:35:45,794 --> 01:35:50,128
They're after you. If the community
airline bill becomes law, we are finished.

1218
01:35:50,299 --> 01:35:52,392
Pan Am will have a monopoly
on international travel.

1219
01:35:52,568 --> 01:35:55,093
Well, how can they justify it?
It's un-American.

1220
01:35:55,270 --> 01:35:59,104
Brewster is saying that nationalized
foreign carriers, like Air France...

1221
01:35:59,274 --> 01:36:02,300
...can offer lower rates because
they don't have to compete.

1222
01:36:02,477 --> 01:36:05,776
Let's get rid of competition
and have a nationalized airline...

1223
01:36:05,948 --> 01:36:09,008
...and why don't we make it Pan Am?
- I'm not kowtowing to anyone.

1224
01:36:09,184 --> 01:36:11,448
- Howard, I need you up here.
- One sec, Odie.

1225
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:14,145
Look, we are Trans World Airlines,
all right?

1226
01:36:14,323 --> 01:36:18,692
Get me something with a circle or a globe
or something round, for God's sake.

1227
01:36:18,861 --> 01:36:20,123
- Speak up.
- One cut.

1228
01:36:20,295 --> 01:36:24,459
I don't give a rat's ass. I'm not making
a cut. I'll release it without a seal.

1229
01:36:24,633 --> 01:36:26,328
We gotta go public with this.

1230
01:36:26,501 --> 01:36:28,366
I'm gonna talk to Hearst...

1231
01:36:28,537 --> 01:36:31,700
...but we gotta get
some senators on our side.

1232
01:36:31,874 --> 01:36:34,274
- What do you want me to do?
- What Trippe does.

1233
01:36:34,443 --> 01:36:37,173
Offshore operations.
See who's up for re-election...

1234
01:36:37,346 --> 01:36:39,940
...let's start making donations.
- Bribe senators?

1235
01:36:40,382 --> 01:36:43,044
I don't want them bribed.
I want it done legally.

1236
01:36:43,218 --> 01:36:46,551
I want them bought.
Put a team of investigators on Brewster.

1237
01:36:46,722 --> 01:36:49,054
I need to know everything
about that shitbag.

1238
01:36:49,224 --> 01:36:52,125
Where he goes, what he says
and who he screws.

1239
01:36:52,294 --> 01:36:54,285
- Get into it right now.
- You got it.

1240
01:37:01,937 --> 01:37:03,370
Just give me a second.

1241
01:37:05,707 --> 01:37:08,699
- All right, what do you need?
- Rudder and elevators.

1242
01:37:09,378 --> 01:37:11,437
No. These are fine.

1243
01:37:11,613 --> 01:37:15,709
Have Simon and Pete get back to me on the
assemblies. We need a secondary system.

1244
01:37:15,884 --> 01:37:17,374
Okay.

1245
01:37:18,186 --> 01:37:20,882
Listen, we need to take
another look at the wheel.

1246
01:37:21,056 --> 01:37:23,854
- Jesus. The damn wheel?
- Yeah.

1247
01:37:24,026 --> 01:37:25,550
It just doesn't feel right.

1248
01:37:25,727 --> 01:37:29,720
Christ almighty, you've seen 8000
goddamn wheels. Choose one, please.

1249
01:37:29,898 --> 01:37:31,695
- Just one of them.
- I know, I know.

1250
01:37:31,867 --> 01:37:34,233
- This one?
- I know, this one...

1251
01:37:34,403 --> 01:37:38,237
This one's pretty close. Pretty close.

1252
01:38:14,276 --> 01:38:15,766
Odie.

1253
01:38:16,678 --> 01:38:19,203
That man sweeping up over there...

1254
01:38:19,381 --> 01:38:22,441
...does he work for me?
I mean, have you seen him before?

1255
01:38:22,617 --> 01:38:25,177
Name's Nick, something like that.

1256
01:38:27,422 --> 01:38:29,185
Why's he looking at me?

1257
01:38:31,393 --> 01:38:32,826
I don't know.

1258
01:38:34,930 --> 01:38:38,058
Fire him. And make sure
they use damp brooms from now on.

1259
01:38:38,233 --> 01:38:41,600
Respiratory diseases are expensive,
and I don't want lawsuits.

1260
01:38:41,770 --> 01:38:44,671
But can we at least proceed
with the instrument panel?

1261
01:38:44,840 --> 01:38:47,274
- The tool shop's ready.
- I wanna see the blueprints.

1262
01:38:47,442 --> 01:38:50,411
Look, Howard, the deadline
is now completely unrealistic.

1263
01:38:50,579 --> 01:38:53,104
The war is gonna be over
by the time she's done.

1264
01:38:53,281 --> 01:38:57,479
I need you to help consult on vital decisions,
and you're off dealing with movies.

1265
01:38:57,652 --> 01:39:00,621
You got 1000 workers waiting
for you to make a decision...

1266
01:39:00,789 --> 01:39:02,416
Hey, Odie!

1267
01:39:02,591 --> 01:39:04,582
Take it easy, all right.

1268
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:08,787
You're under pressure, but it's gonna
do me no good if you crack up on me.

1269
01:39:09,498 --> 01:39:11,227
All right? Look...

1270
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:13,732
...take a couple of hours off, all right.

1271
01:39:13,902 --> 01:39:15,767
- You just relax a little.
- Okay.

1272
01:39:16,204 --> 01:39:18,229
- See your wife.
- Okay.

1273
01:39:18,640 --> 01:39:20,005
All right.

1274
01:39:20,876 --> 01:39:24,107
- Be sure to show me all the blueprints.
- All right.

1275
01:39:25,747 --> 01:39:27,977
Show me all the blueprints.

1276
01:39:28,450 --> 01:39:30,441
Show me all the blueprints.

1277
01:39:30,619 --> 01:39:34,248
I'm serious, now.
Show me all the blueprints.

1278
01:39:35,857 --> 01:39:37,484
Show me all the blueprints.

1279
01:39:37,659 --> 01:39:40,560
- Howard.
- Show me all the blueprints.

1280
01:39:40,729 --> 01:39:42,663
Show me all the blueprints.

1281
01:39:42,831 --> 01:39:44,389
Show me all the blueprints.

1282
01:39:44,566 --> 01:39:46,625
Show me all the blueprints.

1283
01:39:46,802 --> 01:39:48,895
I wanna get this done right.

1284
01:39:49,671 --> 01:39:51,104
Show me all the blueprints.

1285
01:39:51,273 --> 01:39:53,002
Show me all the blueprints.

1286
01:39:53,175 --> 01:39:55,769
Show me all the blueprints.

1287
01:39:55,944 --> 01:39:57,502
Show me all the blueprints.

1288
01:39:57,679 --> 01:39:59,613
- Howard.
- Show me all the blueprints.

1289
01:39:59,781 --> 01:40:03,444
Show me all the blueprints.
Show me all the blueprints...

1290
01:40:30,445 --> 01:40:32,879
Quarantine.

1291
01:40:33,915 --> 01:40:35,610
Q...

1292
01:40:35,784 --> 01:40:37,752
...U...

1293
01:40:37,919 --> 01:40:40,149

...E.

1301
01:41:02,911 --> 01:41:05,004
Quarantine.

1302
01:41:43,018 --> 01:41:46,078
General McEwan. Colonel Bertrang.
Thanks for coming down.

1303
01:41:46,254 --> 01:41:48,415
Odie, you reading me okay?

1304
01:41:48,590 --> 01:41:49,818
Yeah, you're A-okay.

1305
01:41:55,463 --> 01:41:58,660
<i>All right, flight controls are active.</i>
<i>She's all yours.</i>

1306
01:42:07,576 --> 01:42:09,908
Spotless.
No wiggle on the wheel or throttle.

1307
01:42:10,078 --> 01:42:11,909
<i>Take it easy.</i>

1308
01:42:28,930 --> 01:42:32,525
- How does she sound, Howard?
- She's whispering to me, buddy.

1309
01:42:32,701 --> 01:42:34,601
All right, make her sing.

1310
01:42:55,490 --> 01:42:58,721
Well, Odie, she can fly. Congratulations.

1311
01:42:58,893 --> 01:43:02,385
I'm glad to hear it. Retract landing gear
and climb to 5000 feet...

1312
01:43:02,564 --> 01:43:04,122
...on a heading of 2-7-0.

1313
01:43:04,299 --> 01:43:10,169
Retracting landing gear and climbing
to 5000 feet on a heading 2-7-0.

1314
01:43:14,676 --> 01:43:16,871
- She's fast.
- What's your air speed?

1315
01:43:17,045 --> 01:43:18,672
292.

1316
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:22,407
<i>- All right, take her back to 200.</i>
- No damn way.

1317
01:43:48,209 --> 01:43:49,938
We gotta bring her home.

1318
01:43:50,111 --> 01:43:52,545
<i>Scheduled time of one hour</i>
<i>and 45 minutes has elapsed.</i>

1319
01:43:52,747 --> 01:43:55,682
<i>- Set course for 0-9-0...</i>
- Ten more minutes. Roger that.

1320
01:43:55,850 --> 01:43:58,444
<i>Negative, Howard. Bring her home.</i>

1321
01:43:58,620 --> 01:44:04,490
Okay. Okay. Setting course for 0-9-0.

1322
01:44:05,193 --> 01:44:07,093
Preparing to descend.

1323
01:44:10,732 --> 01:44:13,997
- Jesus.
<i>- What is it, Howard?</i>

1324
01:44:15,303 --> 01:44:18,795
The right wing just dipped.
I'm losing starboard engine.

1325
01:44:19,240 --> 01:44:21,868
Increasing power to 2800 rpm.

1326
01:44:22,344 --> 01:44:23,572
Cutting back.

1327
01:44:23,945 --> 01:44:25,879
Increasing starboard engine only.

1328
01:44:27,015 --> 01:44:29,745
Cutting back. I'm losing altitude.

1329
01:44:29,918 --> 01:44:32,478
Check starboard-engine manifold pressure.

1330
01:44:33,355 --> 01:44:37,223
- It's good, but rpm's are low.
<i>- Are both starboard props turning?</i>

1331
01:44:37,392 --> 01:44:38,859
Hold on.

1332
01:44:39,094 --> 01:44:42,120
They are, but she's pulling me
back and starboard, Odie.

1333
01:44:42,297 --> 01:44:44,891
- How bad is your cross control?
- I'm at full left rudder...

1334
01:44:45,066 --> 01:44:48,365
...and full left aileron,
but she won't stay level. Goddamn it.

1335
01:44:48,636 --> 01:44:51,503
- Give us your position.
- Two thousand feet over...

1336
01:44:51,673 --> 01:44:55,734
Oh, Christ, I don't know, Beverly Hills.
Fifteen hundred feet.

1337
01:44:55,910 --> 01:44:57,605
We're going down.

1338
01:44:58,546 --> 01:45:02,141
I'll try for the Wilshire Country Club.
Ninth hole. You reading me?

1339
01:45:02,317 --> 01:45:06,253
<i>Wilshire Country Club, copy that.</i>
<i>Howard, reduce engines to 1000.</i>

1340
01:45:06,955 --> 01:45:11,915
I'm going down!
I'm not gonna make it, buddy!

1341
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,197
Goddamn it!

1342
01:47:22,557 --> 01:47:26,049
Is there anyone else inside?
Is there anyone else?!

1343
01:47:26,227 --> 01:47:27,922
No.

1344
01:47:31,766 --> 01:47:35,133
I'm Howard Hughes, the aviator.

1345
01:47:44,412 --> 01:47:47,108
- every inch of his
wiring and fluid connection.

1346
01:47:47,282 --> 01:47:49,944
He has burns to 78 percent of his body.

1347
01:47:50,118 --> 01:47:52,780
Nine ribs are shattered,
not broken, shattered...

1348
01:47:53,288 --> 01:47:57,748
...as are his nose, his chin, his cheek,
his left knee, his left elbow.

1349
01:47:57,926 --> 01:48:00,520
He has 60 lacerations
on his face, to the bone.

1350
01:48:01,095 --> 01:48:03,859
His chest was crushed,
so his left lung collapsed...

1351
01:48:04,032 --> 01:48:07,695
...and his heart has shifted
to the right side of his chest cavity.

1352
01:48:08,636 --> 01:48:10,536
Jesus, God.

1353
01:48:10,972 --> 01:48:15,306
- He's getting blood transfusions now, but...
- Whose blood?

1354
01:48:16,144 --> 01:48:18,305
- I'm sorry?
- Whose blood?

1355
01:48:18,813 --> 01:48:20,371
From our stock.

1356
01:48:21,049 --> 01:48:25,213
- Oh, he's not going to like that.
- Mr. Dietrich, I doubt he's...

1357
01:48:25,386 --> 01:48:28,321
...ever gonna like or
dislike anything again.

1358
01:48:28,957 --> 01:48:31,118
I'm terribly sorry.

1359
01:48:59,587 --> 01:49:01,487
<i>Orange juice.</i>

1360
01:49:04,592 --> 01:49:08,028
It's not fresh from the kitchen, so I...

1361
01:49:08,730 --> 01:49:13,827
I have them make it here so...
So I can see.

1362
01:49:17,939 --> 01:49:19,873
Look at me.

1363
01:49:22,510 --> 01:49:24,501
I'm a monster.

1364
01:49:24,979 --> 01:49:29,780
Yeah. Orange juice has nutritional value.

1365
01:49:30,952 --> 01:49:35,912
There's... There's some flies
outside my window, though.

1366
01:49:36,491 --> 01:49:38,254
So...

1367
01:49:40,294 --> 01:49:42,956
...little Howard likes...

1368
01:49:44,432 --> 01:49:46,559
...citrus.

1369
01:49:47,335 --> 01:49:49,200
Don't he just?

1370
01:49:52,340 --> 01:49:54,035
Tell me.

1371
01:49:55,677 --> 01:49:59,477
An oil seal ripped off
the starboard rear propeller.

1372
01:49:59,647 --> 01:50:03,105
When the pressure dropped,
the prop reversed pitch.

1373
01:50:03,618 --> 01:50:05,381
Do you understand me?

1374
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:10,914
Howard, I'm sorry to have to tell you
this now, but there's something else.

1375
01:50:11,325 --> 01:50:14,055
- You following me?
- Yeah.

1376
01:50:15,263 --> 01:50:18,926
The Air Force canceled the contract
on The Hercules.

1377
01:50:21,269 --> 01:50:26,673
The war's over now,
and they say they don't need it anymore.

1378
01:50:27,141 --> 01:50:31,601
I have to know what you want me to do.
Should I release the staff?

1379
01:50:31,779 --> 01:50:33,872
How far...

1380
01:50:35,683 --> 01:50:37,116
...from finishing?

1381
01:50:38,352 --> 01:50:43,153
- About six months.
- No, in money.

1382
01:50:46,427 --> 01:50:48,292
Seven million.

1383
01:50:49,097 --> 01:50:50,462
Maybe more.

1384
01:50:55,870 --> 01:50:57,701
Build it.

1385
01:50:59,207 --> 01:51:01,141
Build it, Odie.

1386
01:51:02,977 --> 01:51:04,501
Howard...

1387
01:51:05,146 --> 01:51:09,207
...a Constellation crashed
outside Reading, Pennsylvania.

1388
01:51:09,684 --> 01:51:13,120
The Civil Aeronautics Board
has grounded the whole fleet.

1389
01:51:23,097 --> 01:51:24,758
You know...

1390
01:51:25,833 --> 01:51:29,098
...Juan Trippe sent me flowers.

1391
01:51:31,305 --> 01:51:33,000
Take a look.

1392
01:51:36,778 --> 01:51:41,647
- What did you do with all the others?
- Oh, I had them taken out.

1393
01:51:41,816 --> 01:51:44,979
They... They attract aphids.

1394
01:51:46,020 --> 01:51:50,719
Aphids are...
They're just awful little creatures.

1395
01:51:51,592 --> 01:51:53,355
But...

1396
01:51:55,696 --> 01:51:57,789
But these ones...

1397
01:51:58,766 --> 01:52:02,634
...I wanted to see these ones every day.

1398
01:52:10,178 --> 01:52:13,170
<i>Can white elephants fly?</i>
<i>That's everybody's question.</i>

1399
01:52:13,347 --> 01:52:18,375
<i>The hull of the world's mightiest airplane,</i>
<i>a flying boat built by Howard Hughes.</i>

1400
01:52:18,553 --> 01:52:22,717
<i>Two hundred and twenty feet long,</i>
<i>it towers higher than a five-story building.</i>

1401
01:52:22,890 --> 01:52:26,883
<i>Power lines have to be cut as it starts</i>
<i>the trip from Culver City...</i>

1402
01:52:27,061 --> 01:52:29,086
<i>... to the Pacific, 30 miles away.</i>

1403
01:52:29,263 --> 01:52:32,494
<i>Moving the 60-ton load</i>
<i>is quite an engineering problem.</i>

1404
01:52:32,667 --> 01:52:36,626
<i>But you gotta ask, was anything this big</i>
<i>ever supposed to fly?</i>

1405
01:52:36,804 --> 01:52:41,298
<i>There goes one wing section,</i>
<i>160 feet long with four engine housings.</i>

1406
01:52:41,475 --> 01:52:44,342
<i>Double that and you've got some idea</i>
<i>of the wingspread.</i>

1407
01:52:44,512 --> 01:52:48,812
<i>An airplane that challenges</i>
<i>a mountain for sheer size.</i>

1408
01:52:55,823 --> 01:52:58,053
How long can they keep us grounded?

1409
01:52:58,226 --> 01:53:01,787
Until they finish investigating
the Reading crash. Could be months.

1410
01:53:01,963 --> 01:53:06,900
You're running a $14 million deficit. How
will you afford to keep them out of service?

1411
01:53:07,101 --> 01:53:11,595
- We go international, we'll make it up.
- Brewster's C.A.B. bill isn't going away.

1412
01:53:11,772 --> 01:53:14,502
That bill passes,
and you bought these for nothing.

1413
01:53:14,675 --> 01:53:18,076
- We're fighting the C.A.B. bill.
- Meanwhile, how do we keep TWA flying?

1414
01:53:18,246 --> 01:53:22,842
Don't say, "Just go to Tool Co." We're
pumping every cent into The Hercules...

1415
01:53:23,017 --> 01:53:25,815
...which the Air Force
doesn't even want anymore.

1416
01:53:25,987 --> 01:53:29,753
I'm glad Jack is feeling sunny about things,
but I've seen the books.

1417
01:53:30,091 --> 01:53:32,525
I'm telling it straight. I'm not crying wolf.

1418
01:53:32,693 --> 01:53:35,787
We're in serious trouble.
You've gotta make a choice.

1419
01:53:35,963 --> 01:53:41,026
You wanna be bankrupted
by the big plane or by the big airline?

1420
01:53:48,342 --> 01:53:51,937
Go see Thomas Parkinson
at the Equitable in New York.

1421
01:53:52,113 --> 01:53:55,674
Get a loan against
all the TWA equipment and capital.

1422
01:53:55,850 --> 01:54:01,686
Use the planes as collateral. Hell, use the
desks, use the pens, use everything we got.

1423
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:06,020
- Try to get me 40 million.
- And if TWA defaults on the loan?

1424
01:54:06,627 --> 01:54:09,528
Then Juan Trippe buys us cheap.

1425
01:54:12,133 --> 01:54:15,227
Under my bed! You put a goddamn
microphone under my bed!

1426
01:54:15,403 --> 01:54:17,530
Listen to me.
I am concerned about you.

1427
01:54:17,705 --> 01:54:21,072
- I just wanna make sure you're okay.
- And who is in that car?!

1428
01:54:21,409 --> 01:54:23,570
It's been with me 24 hours a day.

1429
01:54:23,744 --> 01:54:25,507
That car is for your protection!

1430
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:29,138
The only one I need protection from is you,
you sick bastard!

1431
01:54:29,317 --> 01:54:30,841
You don't own me, Howard.

1432
01:54:31,018 --> 01:54:34,146
I'm not one of your teenage whores
or some damn airplane.

1433
01:54:34,322 --> 01:54:36,347
I'll have them take all the bugs out.

1434
01:54:36,524 --> 01:54:38,549
I need to know where you are.

1435
01:54:38,726 --> 01:54:41,388
- Why?!
- Because I worry about you, that's why.

1436
01:54:41,562 --> 01:54:43,553
Bullshit!

1437
01:54:46,067 --> 01:54:48,160
What do you mean, "all the bugs"?

1438
01:54:54,241 --> 01:54:56,869
What do you mean, "all the bugs"?

1439
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:01,171
There's more.

1440
01:55:01,449 --> 01:55:03,246
How many?

1441
01:55:03,551 --> 01:55:09,717
I don't know, 12.
Twelve, maybe, and on the telephones.

1442
01:55:10,191 --> 01:55:13,854
Oh, Christ, Howard, on the telephone?

1443
01:55:14,028 --> 01:55:15,620
You listen to my phone calls?

1444
01:55:15,796 --> 01:55:19,596
No, no, honey, I would never do that.
I'd never do that.

1445
01:55:19,767 --> 01:55:22,793
I just read the transcripts, that's all.

1446
01:55:27,408 --> 01:55:29,535
What do you wanna know, Howard?

1447
01:55:29,710 --> 01:55:31,871
Was I screwing Artie Shaw last night?

1448
01:55:32,046 --> 01:55:34,742
Was I screwing Sinatra the night before?
You bet.

1449
01:55:34,915 --> 01:55:37,509
Everyone said you were a lunatic,
I didn't listen.

1450
01:55:37,685 --> 01:55:40,586
It's no wonder Kate Hepburn
dumped your demented ass!

1451
01:55:40,755 --> 01:55:43,223
Shut your goddamn mouth.

1452
01:55:47,395 --> 01:55:50,831
Get out, you pathetic freak.

1453
01:55:58,239 --> 01:56:00,400
Get out!

1454
01:56:00,574 --> 01:56:02,235
Is everything all right, sir?

1455
01:56:02,410 --> 01:56:04,742
Take out all the bugs, huh?

1456
01:56:06,881 --> 01:56:08,974
Except for the one
on the bedroom phone.

1457
01:56:09,150 --> 01:56:10,947
Sir, the FBI are at the house.

1458
01:56:12,787 --> 01:56:17,383
This is outrageous! Everything here is the
private property of Hughes Productions.

1459
01:56:17,558 --> 01:56:20,254
- My legal counsel is on the way...
- Federal warrant.

1460
01:56:20,428 --> 01:56:22,692
Don't interfere with the search, sir.

1461
01:56:42,383 --> 01:56:45,875
<i>Dateline: Los Angeles.</i>
<i>Howard Hughes has a new houseguest.</i>

1462
01:56:46,053 --> 01:56:49,648
<i>No, it's not another beautiful starlet.</i>
<i>This time it's the FBI.</i>

1463
01:56:49,824 --> 01:56:53,726
<i>Noah, you've got to help. This is</i>
<i>the 10th time they have been here.</i>

1464
01:56:53,894 --> 01:56:57,352
<i>Rumor has it that agents</i>
<i>working for Senator Owen Brewster...</i>

1465
01:56:57,531 --> 01:57:01,365
<i>... have practically taken up residence</i>
<i>in the aviation mogul's home.</i>

1466
01:57:01,535 --> 01:57:03,628
Look, I mean, they are touching things.

1467
01:57:03,971 --> 01:57:07,099
- Noah, they are touching things.
<i>- Just keep yourself calm...</i>

1468
01:57:07,274 --> 01:57:10,300
<i>... and I'll be down there</i>
<i>as soon as I can, Howard.</i>

1469
01:57:10,478 --> 01:57:12,173
<i>Howard?</i>

1470
01:57:12,346 --> 01:57:14,177
<i>Howard?</i>

1471
01:57:38,539 --> 01:57:40,439
Howard, hello.

1472
01:57:40,608 --> 01:57:43,941
- Nice to see you again.
- Good to see you. Come on inside.

1473
01:57:44,111 --> 01:57:46,636
- Emma, you can start up lunch now.
- Yes, sir.

1474
01:57:46,814 --> 01:57:51,308
Well, really lovely room.
It's nicely decorated.

1475
01:57:51,485 --> 01:57:53,248
Thank you. Here, have a seat.

1476
01:57:53,420 --> 01:57:54,853
Thanks for coming by.

1477
01:57:55,022 --> 01:57:58,150
I thought you and I
should have a chance to talk privately.

1478
01:57:58,325 --> 01:58:00,088
You know, outside the office.

1479
01:58:02,096 --> 01:58:03,427
Well...

1480
01:58:03,964 --> 01:58:05,932
...I appreciate that, Owen.

1481
01:58:13,340 --> 01:58:18,368
So you're coming out pretty strong
against the C.A.B. bill.

1482
01:58:19,113 --> 01:58:24,210
- You're coming on pretty strong for it.
- Well, it's my bill, Howard, you know.

1483
01:58:24,385 --> 01:58:28,617
Look, I believe sincerely
that America cannot afford...

1484
01:58:28,789 --> 01:58:31,622
...to have more than one
international carrier.

1485
01:58:33,194 --> 01:58:38,359
I mean, do you think it's fair that one airline
should have a monopoly on international..?

1486
01:58:38,532 --> 01:58:41,899
A monopoly? No, no, no. Oh, no.

1487
01:58:42,069 --> 01:58:47,132
No, I think one airline could do it better,
see, without competition.

1488
01:58:47,508 --> 01:58:52,138
All I'm thinking about are the interests,
the needs of the American passenger.

1489
01:58:52,513 --> 01:58:55,448
That's just beautiful. What is that?

1490
01:58:59,653 --> 01:59:01,951
What is that? Is that a?

1491
01:59:02,122 --> 01:59:04,022
Is that a yak?

1492
01:59:04,191 --> 01:59:06,921
- Some kind of a yak?
- No, that's a llama.

1493
01:59:07,094 --> 01:59:09,358
My wife picked that up
when we were in Peru.

1494
01:59:09,530 --> 01:59:11,589
Son of a gun.

1495
01:59:11,765 --> 01:59:14,256
A real llama.

1496
01:59:15,569 --> 01:59:19,198
- From Peru?
- Yeah. From a year ago, I think it was...

1497
01:59:19,373 --> 01:59:22,570
- Yeah, it was about a year ago.
- Lunch is served, senator.

1498
01:59:22,743 --> 01:59:25,234
Good. Okay.
Come on, let's go have some lunch.

1499
01:59:26,814 --> 01:59:30,807
Now, did you..?
Did you actually get to see any llamas?

1500
01:59:30,985 --> 01:59:33,453
No, no. My wife just liked the painting.

1501
01:59:33,621 --> 01:59:36,681
It's an interesting animal.
I'll have to read up on those.

1502
01:59:36,857 --> 01:59:41,294
How do you spell that?
Like? Like Fernando Lamas?

1503
01:59:41,662 --> 01:59:45,928
No, no. It's...
It's the animal, it's got two L's.

1504
01:59:46,100 --> 01:59:48,125
Here, come on, have a seat.

1505
01:59:57,278 --> 01:59:59,746
It's brook trout. Hope you like fish.

1506
02:00:02,283 --> 02:00:05,912
I love it. Thanks.

1507
02:00:21,135 --> 02:00:25,265
I know you're not a drinking man,
so I hope... Hope water's okay.

1508
02:00:38,152 --> 02:00:39,744
Thanks.

1509
02:00:45,693 --> 02:00:49,094
All right, let's get down to business.
Let's talk turkey.

1510
02:00:49,963 --> 02:00:52,295
My investigators...

1511
02:00:53,033 --> 02:00:55,866
My investigators
have turned up a lot of dirt.

1512
02:00:56,337 --> 02:00:59,670
It could be really embarrassing
if this stuff got out.

1513
02:01:00,374 --> 02:01:02,899
I'd like to save you
from that embarrassment.

1514
02:01:04,178 --> 02:01:06,305
That's very kind of you, Owen.

1515
02:01:09,316 --> 02:01:13,150
My committee has the power
to hold public hearings.

1516
02:01:14,722 --> 02:01:16,622
I'd like to spare you that.

1517
02:01:17,324 --> 02:01:18,552
Would you, now?

1518
02:01:19,893 --> 02:01:21,417
Look...

1519
02:01:21,595 --> 02:01:26,294
Do you wanna go down in history
as a war profiteer, Howard?

1520
02:01:26,467 --> 02:01:27,729
Is that what you want?

1521
02:01:30,237 --> 02:01:32,467
What do you want, Owen?

1522
02:01:34,041 --> 02:01:40,139
You agree to support my C.A.B. bill,
and I won't hold public hearings.

1523
02:01:40,314 --> 02:01:42,043
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

1524
02:01:42,216 --> 02:01:45,811
I can't do that, Owen.
The C.A.B. would kill TWA.

1525
02:01:45,986 --> 02:01:49,114
Sell TWA to Pan Am.

1526
02:01:49,757 --> 02:01:52,885
You'll get a good price.
You'll get a fair price.

1527
02:01:53,961 --> 02:01:56,156
And then..? Then you won't go public?

1528
02:01:56,330 --> 02:02:01,165
Right. That's right. The investigation's
closed. Nobody knows a thing.

1529
02:02:01,335 --> 02:02:04,361
That's... It's better for everybody.

1530
02:02:09,042 --> 02:02:12,569
You know, Owen,
I'm still wondering one thing.

1531
02:02:12,746 --> 02:02:16,443
- What's that?
- The picture of the llama you got last year?

1532
02:02:16,617 --> 02:02:19,279
- Yeah.
- Where'd you sail from?

1533
02:02:19,987 --> 02:02:22,012
We didn't sail. We flew.

1534
02:02:23,390 --> 02:02:25,517
- You flew?
- Yeah.

1535
02:02:33,333 --> 02:02:36,598
Are you sure you want to do this, Owen?

1536
02:02:37,371 --> 02:02:39,805
You want to go to war with me?

1537
02:02:44,611 --> 02:02:48,945
It isn't me, Howard.
It's the United States government.

1538
02:02:49,917 --> 02:02:52,477
We just beat Germany and Japan.

1539
02:02:53,053 --> 02:02:55,078
Who the hell are you?

1540
02:03:00,327 --> 02:03:05,026
You... You tell Juan Trippe
something for me, all right?

1541
02:03:05,666 --> 02:03:08,430
Tell him thanks for the flowers.

1542
02:03:08,802 --> 02:03:14,035
And he can kiss both sides of my ass.

1543
02:03:38,065 --> 02:03:40,533
<i>Well, we have a long list of particulars.</i>

1544
02:03:40,701 --> 02:03:44,865
Chief among them is that he defrauded
the American government...

1545
02:03:45,038 --> 02:03:48,599
...of $56 million while at war,
when we could least afford it.

1546
02:03:48,775 --> 02:03:51,801
While brave men were dying
on the beaches of Normandy...

1547
02:03:51,979 --> 02:03:55,415
...Mr. Hughes was picking the pocket
of the American taxpayer.

1548
02:03:55,582 --> 02:03:56,913
I sleep...

1549
02:03:57,718 --> 02:03:59,982
...in this room...

1550
02:04:01,722 --> 02:04:03,121
...in the dark.

1551
02:04:03,290 --> 02:04:06,191
I'll have him dragged here to Washington
if I have to.

1552
02:04:06,360 --> 02:04:08,590
I wanna see the whites of his lies.

1553
02:04:08,862 --> 02:04:10,887
I have a place.

1554
02:04:11,665 --> 02:04:15,294
- I can sleep.
<i>- He has a lot of questions to answer.</i>

1555
02:04:15,469 --> 02:04:18,529
- I have a chair.
- Particularly about that monstrous...

1556
02:04:18,705 --> 02:04:23,165
...boondoggle of his,
that model airplane he's building...

1557
02:04:23,343 --> 02:04:27,939
...that flying lumberyard,
that spruce goose.

1558
02:04:29,583 --> 02:04:31,949
<i>No, he'll... We'll get him here.</i>

1559
02:04:35,522 --> 02:04:36,955
That's just beautiful.

1560
02:04:37,958 --> 02:04:41,553
Oh, yeah. I like the desert.

1561
02:04:43,463 --> 02:04:47,229
It's hot there in the desert,
but it's clean.

1562
02:04:47,801 --> 02:04:49,462
It's clean.

1563
02:04:51,204 --> 02:04:53,138
I need to sleep.

1564
02:04:56,043 --> 02:04:58,341
I should drink something first.

1565
02:05:02,916 --> 02:05:04,679
I should drink something first.

1566
02:05:09,389 --> 02:05:11,118
Wait a minute.

1567
02:05:12,492 --> 02:05:14,016
What if that milk is sour?

1568
02:05:15,262 --> 02:05:16,889
That milk is bad.

1569
02:05:17,631 --> 02:05:22,591
I shouldn't pick up
the bottle of milk with my right hand.

1570
02:05:23,003 --> 02:05:29,272
And I shouldn't take the top off
with my left hand...

1571
02:05:30,243 --> 02:05:33,371
...put it in my pocket.

1572
02:05:33,547 --> 02:05:36,141
My left pocket.

1573
02:05:52,933 --> 02:05:57,199
Howard, it's Kate.
I need... I need to talk to you.

1574
02:05:58,405 --> 02:06:00,373
Can you hear me?

1575
02:06:02,843 --> 02:06:04,834
I'm coming in.

1576
02:06:09,683 --> 02:06:12,413
Howard, unlock this door immediately.

1577
02:06:20,961 --> 02:06:23,361
I can't, sweetie.

1578
02:06:26,266 --> 02:06:28,166
You mean you won't.

1579
02:06:30,037 --> 02:06:33,473
Howard, please let me see you.

1580
02:06:33,640 --> 02:06:38,805
- I haven't shaved.
- Well, neither have I.

1581
02:06:42,015 --> 02:06:43,846
Come on.

1582
02:06:44,017 --> 02:06:45,712
You...

1583
02:06:45,886 --> 02:06:48,354
You let me in.

1584
02:06:54,061 --> 02:06:56,427
I can hear you, Katie.

1585
02:06:57,898 --> 02:07:03,393
I could always hear you.
Even in the cockpit, with the engines on.

1586
02:07:04,071 --> 02:07:07,472
That's because I'm so goddamn loud.

1587
02:07:12,245 --> 02:07:14,179
Howard, I...

1588
02:07:16,249 --> 02:07:18,649
I came to thank you.

1589
02:07:19,486 --> 02:07:22,717
I found out what you did
for Spence and me.

1590
02:07:22,889 --> 02:07:26,154
Buying those awful pictures.

1591
02:07:30,797 --> 02:07:32,458
You love him.

1592
02:07:39,206 --> 02:07:41,834
He's everything I have.

1593
02:07:49,883 --> 02:07:51,908
Howard?

1594
02:07:52,886 --> 02:07:55,320
I'm glad for you, Kate.

1595
02:07:56,656 --> 02:07:59,090
Go away now. Would you do that?

1596
02:08:00,494 --> 02:08:03,759
- Howard, please.
- Go away.

1597
02:08:03,930 --> 02:08:07,331
Just for now. I'll see you soon.

1598
02:08:07,501 --> 02:08:09,901
- We'll go flying together.
- Yes.

1599
02:08:10,070 --> 02:08:12,937
Yes, please. You take me flying again.

1600
02:08:13,106 --> 02:08:15,939
Howard, I can take the wheel.

1601
02:08:21,782 --> 02:08:23,374
Howard?

1602
02:08:29,856 --> 02:08:31,915
Howard, are you..? Are you there?

1603
02:08:37,631 --> 02:08:39,292
Howard?

1604
02:08:41,101 --> 02:08:42,966
Howard, are you there?

1605
02:08:45,438 --> 02:08:47,463
Come on, Howard.

1606
02:08:50,410 --> 02:08:52,344
Howard, are you there?

1607
02:09:18,605 --> 02:09:20,698
Come in with the milk.

1608
02:09:20,874 --> 02:09:23,035
Come in with the milk.

1609
02:09:23,210 --> 02:09:25,542
Come in with the milk.

1610
02:09:25,846 --> 02:09:28,872
He is to open the bag
with his right hand...

1611
02:09:29,049 --> 02:09:32,143
...and hold the bag out to me
at a 45-degree angle...

1612
02:09:32,319 --> 02:09:35,652
...so I may reach into the bag without...

1613
02:09:37,691 --> 02:09:39,921
Without touching the paper.

1614
02:09:44,931 --> 02:09:46,990
Repeated from the beginning.

1615
02:09:47,534 --> 02:09:49,729
Repeated from the beginning.

1616
02:09:50,470 --> 02:09:52,563

Hello?

1644
02:11:30,170 --> 02:11:31,535
Who is it?

1645
02:11:31,705 --> 02:11:33,696
Howard, it's Juan.

1646
02:11:42,182 --> 02:11:44,116
Juan.

1647
02:11:44,684 --> 02:11:46,948
Juan, right. Yeah.

1648
02:11:47,120 --> 02:11:49,884
We had an appointment, right? Yeah.

1649
02:11:50,557 --> 02:11:53,025
I remember that. Look...

1650
02:11:53,193 --> 02:11:55,991
...I got a hell of a cold in here.
A hell of a cold.

1651
02:11:56,162 --> 02:11:59,563
So take a seat out there,
because I don't wanna get you sick.

1652
02:12:00,033 --> 02:12:05,130
I'd never forgive myself if I got you sick.
I don't wanna get you sick. I don't wanna...

1653
02:12:12,278 --> 02:12:14,109
Thank you.

1654
02:12:16,716 --> 02:12:18,479
Okay, Howard, I'm sitting.

1655
02:12:19,152 --> 02:12:22,212
I've brought along our accountings.
Now...

1656
02:12:22,389 --> 02:12:25,552
...Pan Am is trading
at 13 and five-eighths.

1657
02:12:25,725 --> 02:12:28,353
TWA at four and a quarter.

1658
02:12:28,528 --> 02:12:29,995
- Now, if you take...
- Come on.

1659
02:12:30,163 --> 02:12:35,430
Come on, come on, come on.
We both know I'm not gonna sell TWA.

1660
02:12:35,602 --> 02:12:37,661
Besides, you couldn't afford her.

1661
02:12:37,837 --> 02:12:41,603
Our domestic routes alone
are worth more than twice Pan Am.

1662
02:12:42,208 --> 02:12:45,439
Well, considering our stock is trading
at three times yours...

1663
02:12:45,612 --> 02:12:48,638
...I find that a dubious claim, Howard.

1664
02:12:48,815 --> 02:12:50,214
What I...

1665
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:56,914
What I mean is,
you have no domestic routes. All right?

1666
02:12:57,090 --> 02:12:59,217
I mean, you get TWA,
you span the globe.

1667
02:12:59,392 --> 02:13:02,088
I'm not gonna sell,
and you know I'm not gonna sell.

1668
02:13:02,262 --> 02:13:04,127
Here's the point.

1669
02:13:04,297 --> 02:13:06,765
Owen Brewster works for you.

1670
02:13:07,333 --> 02:13:13,169
Howard, I didn't elect Senator Brewster.
We can thank the voters of Maine for that.

1671
02:13:20,847 --> 02:13:26,308
Now, if I appear at his hearings, Juan,
it could get nasty.

1672
02:13:26,486 --> 02:13:28,511
Real nasty for all of us.

1673
02:13:28,688 --> 02:13:33,057
Well, I think,
considerably more so for you.

1674
02:13:33,460 --> 02:13:36,657
While the good people of America
were losing sons at Anzio...

1675
02:13:36,830 --> 02:13:40,561
...you produced a dirty movie
and built airplanes that don't fly.

1676
02:13:40,733 --> 02:13:43,293
Well, that's just not fair, is it?

1677
02:13:43,470 --> 02:13:47,270
I mean, the XF-11 flew quite well
for an hour and 45 minutes.

1678
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:51,740
I wish you were up there with me, Juan.
It was exhilarating.

1679
02:13:52,679 --> 02:13:56,080
Be that as it may, you still have
to answer for the Spruce Goose.

1680
02:13:56,816 --> 02:13:59,284
It's called The Hercules!

1681
02:13:59,452 --> 02:14:02,683
And it will fly, goddamn it!

1682
02:14:02,856 --> 02:14:06,917
I hope so. The American people deserve
something for their $13 million.

1683
02:14:07,093 --> 02:14:10,085
I won't sell TWA!

1684
02:14:10,263 --> 02:14:11,389
I won't!

1685
02:14:16,402 --> 02:14:18,393
I know that, Howard.

1686
02:14:19,205 --> 02:14:20,900
I know that.

1687
02:14:22,709 --> 02:14:25,337
But I'm going to get it anyway.

1688
02:14:26,312 --> 02:14:30,180
You will default on your loan from
Equitable after Senator Brewster...

1689
02:14:30,350 --> 02:14:34,650
...destroys your reputation and you can't
find additional capital for the airline.

1690
02:14:34,821 --> 02:14:40,020
The hearings will also show Hughes Aircraft
to be mismanaged and incompetent...

1691
02:14:40,193 --> 02:14:42,252
...and it will go bankrupt too.

1692
02:14:42,428 --> 02:14:45,989
But you won't be insolvent.
You'll still have Tool Co.

1693
02:14:46,166 --> 02:14:50,000
Perhaps you'll head back to Houston
to rebuild your empire.

1694
02:14:50,236 --> 02:14:52,363
I rather hope you do.

1695
02:14:52,805 --> 02:14:56,138
By that time,
Pan Am will have bought TWA...

1696
02:14:56,309 --> 02:15:00,336
...and painted all those magnificent
Connies blue and white.

1697
02:15:00,513 --> 02:15:05,382
So when you do return,
it will be on a Pan Am plane.

1698
02:15:08,821 --> 02:15:10,482
Well...

1699
02:15:12,458 --> 02:15:15,552
You seem to have me
in a corner here, buddy.

1700
02:15:16,563 --> 02:15:19,726
Not a position in which
I'm very comfortable.

1701
02:15:21,301 --> 02:15:25,203
I think you're gonna be less comfortable
at Senator Brewster's hearings.

1702
02:15:26,306 --> 02:15:28,638
Very public, Howard.

1703
02:15:30,643 --> 02:15:34,079
Lots of cameras and newsmen.

1704
02:15:34,314 --> 02:15:38,080
I understand you're not
particularly fond of crowds.

1705
02:15:39,953 --> 02:15:43,116
Perhaps we should spare you that.

1706
02:15:45,024 --> 02:15:49,961
Well, thank you for your concern, Juan.

1707
02:15:50,129 --> 02:15:52,120
I find that...

1708
02:15:53,266 --> 02:15:55,427
...very moving.

1709
02:15:56,202 --> 02:15:58,193
It's been a real pleasure.

1710
02:15:59,839 --> 02:16:02,933
Noah will see you back
to the airport now.

1711
02:16:03,943 --> 02:16:05,308
You fly safe.

1712
02:16:09,082 --> 02:16:11,346
You fly safe.

1713
02:16:16,289 --> 02:16:19,019
Thank you, Howard,
and you take care of that cold.

1714
02:16:19,192 --> 02:16:21,126
Don't you worry.

1715
02:16:21,294 --> 02:16:23,455
I certainly will.

1716
02:16:24,397 --> 02:16:26,126
Bye-bye.

1717
02:16:30,803 --> 02:16:35,570
If you let him appear at those hearings,
the whole world will see what he's become.

1718
02:16:35,742 --> 02:16:38,643
People should remember him as he was.

1719
02:16:43,816 --> 02:16:47,308
He'll have a subpoena in three days
to appear in Washington.

1720
02:16:48,588 --> 02:16:51,148
If you can get him out of there by then.

1721
02:17:40,973 --> 02:17:42,804
Mr. Hughes?

1722
02:17:48,881 --> 02:17:51,213
I don't have any shoes.

1723
02:17:53,052 --> 02:17:55,919
- Could you get me some shoes?
- Shoes.

1724
02:17:56,689 --> 02:17:58,213
Yeah.

1725
02:18:23,616 --> 02:18:26,244
How nice of you to dress for me.

1726
02:18:29,489 --> 02:18:31,616
Can I come in?

1727
02:18:32,425 --> 02:18:36,794
Yeah, you can come in.

1728
02:18:43,636 --> 02:18:45,604
Thank you for coming.

1729
02:18:58,017 --> 02:19:00,076
Now, let's get a drink.

1730
02:19:00,253 --> 02:19:04,383
Wait, wait, wait, honey.
You can't move. You're safe here.

1731
02:19:04,557 --> 02:19:07,651
You're in the germ-free zone now.
You understand?

1732
02:19:07,827 --> 02:19:13,288
- I'll take my chances.
- No, no, honey. Wait, wait.

1733
02:19:26,412 --> 02:19:28,812
Love what you've done with the place.

1734
02:19:35,621 --> 02:19:39,682
Now, let me look at you.

1735
02:19:44,397 --> 02:19:46,831
When do you go to Washington?

1736
02:19:47,333 --> 02:19:49,233
A week.

1737
02:19:49,402 --> 02:19:52,303
No, no. Just under a week.

1738
02:19:52,472 --> 02:19:56,932
I don't know the date today,
but I have to be...

1739
02:19:57,109 --> 02:19:59,669
All right, take it easy.

1740
02:20:12,625 --> 02:20:15,287
There's nothing there, Howard.

1741
02:20:22,201 --> 02:20:25,602
I see things.

1742
02:20:26,472 --> 02:20:28,372
I know, baby.

1743
02:20:29,509 --> 02:20:31,875
Rinse your face off, now.

1744
02:20:40,786 --> 02:20:43,277
Put your hands in the water
and wash off the soap.

1745
02:20:43,456 --> 02:20:46,721
I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.

1746
02:20:51,163 --> 02:20:54,599
- Does that look clean to you?
- Nothing's clean, Howard.

1747
02:20:54,767 --> 02:20:57,759
But we do our best, right?

1748
02:20:58,504 --> 02:21:00,233
Yeah.

1749
02:21:19,592 --> 02:21:21,287
What do you think?

1750
02:21:21,460 --> 02:21:24,896
- Well, I look all right.
- You look great.

1751
02:21:25,064 --> 02:21:26,725
Will you marry me?

1752
02:21:26,899 --> 02:21:29,595
You're too crazy for me.

1753
02:21:31,237 --> 02:21:33,603
I gotta go, baby.

1754
02:21:34,340 --> 02:21:36,171
Okay.

1755
02:21:36,909 --> 02:21:38,604
Thanks.

1756
02:21:44,550 --> 02:21:46,780
You'd do it for me.

1757
02:21:53,159 --> 02:21:55,127
Hi, Howard. How you doing?

1758
02:22:35,901 --> 02:22:38,267
The committee will come to order.

1759
02:22:38,904 --> 02:22:43,637
Ladies and gentlemen, I must insist that
we maintain quiet during these proceedings.

1760
02:22:43,809 --> 02:22:47,040
All right, Mr. Hughes,
will you stand and be sworn?

1761
02:22:49,015 --> 02:22:53,042
Do you solemnly swear that in the matter
now pending before this committee...

1762
02:22:53,219 --> 02:22:57,349
...you will tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1763
02:22:57,523 --> 02:22:59,753
- I do.
- Pardon me for speaking loudly...

1764
02:22:59,925 --> 02:23:04,191
...but I know you have difficulty hearing.
- That's quite all right.

1765
02:23:04,497 --> 02:23:08,058
I mean, everybody knows I'm deaf.
I'm not gonna try to hide it.

1766
02:23:10,469 --> 02:23:13,131
Mr. Hughes, it is the intention
of this committee...

1767
02:23:13,305 --> 02:23:14,863
Mr. Hughes has a statement.

1768
02:23:16,208 --> 02:23:22,113
All right, you may proceed
with this statement, Mr. Hughes.

1769
02:23:28,421 --> 02:23:30,719
Mr. Hughes, do you have a statement?

1770
02:23:38,064 --> 02:23:42,330
I'm gonna attempt to be honest here.

1771
02:23:43,069 --> 02:23:48,063
I mean, my reputation's being destroyed,
so I might as well lay the cards on the table.

1772
02:23:48,908 --> 02:23:52,969
Senator Brewster, if you hadn't
gone too far overboard...

1773
02:23:53,145 --> 02:23:55,807
...if you hadn't put
the red-hot iron in my side...

1774
02:23:55,981 --> 02:24:00,509
...I might have been willing to take a
shellacking in this publicity spree of yours.

1775
02:24:00,686 --> 02:24:06,249
I may have been willing to sit back and take
a certain amount of abuse simply because...

1776
02:24:06,992 --> 02:24:09,586
...well, I am only a private citizen.

1777
02:24:09,762 --> 02:24:11,855
Whereas you are a senator...

1778
02:24:12,031 --> 02:24:14,932
...with all sorts of powers.

1779
02:24:15,768 --> 02:24:18,703
But I think this goddamn circus
has gone on long enough!

1780
02:24:18,871 --> 02:24:22,739
- That's quite sufficient.
- You have called me a liar, sir, in the press.

1781
02:24:22,908 --> 02:24:25,934
You have called me a liar
and a thief and a war profiteer!

1782
02:24:26,112 --> 02:24:30,071
- The witness will restrain...
- Why not tell the truth for once, senator?

1783
02:24:30,249 --> 02:24:34,709
Why not tell the truth that this investigation
was really born on the day that TWA...

1784
02:24:34,887 --> 02:24:40,450
...decided to fly to Europe? On the day that
TWA first invaded Juan Trippe's territory!

1785
02:24:40,626 --> 02:24:43,151
- Sit down.
- On the day TWA first challenged...

1786
02:24:43,329 --> 02:24:47,891
...the generally accepted theory that only
Juan Trippe's great Pan American Airways...

1787
02:24:48,067 --> 02:24:52,163
...had the right to fly the Atlantic!
- You are not here to make a speech.

1788
02:24:53,172 --> 02:24:56,630
I asked for silence!
I asked for quiet in this room...

1789
02:24:56,809 --> 02:25:00,836
We have in our possession receipts
in the amount of $170,000...

1790
02:25:02,181 --> 02:25:06,481
...acquired from Mr. John Meyer.
Mr. Meyer works for you, does he not?

1791
02:25:06,652 --> 02:25:10,816
- He does.
- And what is his official title?

1792
02:25:11,724 --> 02:25:15,285
I don't exactly know, senator.
A lot of people work for me.

1793
02:25:15,461 --> 02:25:18,259
Can you explain why your press agent
would pay out...

1794
02:25:18,430 --> 02:25:23,424
...more than $170,000 to representatives
of the United States Air Force?

1795
02:25:23,602 --> 02:25:28,039
- I don't know. You'd have to ask him.
- Well, would you produce him?

1796
02:25:28,941 --> 02:25:32,104
- Produce him?
- Will you cause him to appear?

1797
02:25:32,278 --> 02:25:35,509
You had John Meyer on the stand
for three days last week.

1798
02:25:35,681 --> 02:25:38,445
Be that as it may,
we would like him to reappear.

1799
02:25:38,617 --> 02:25:42,075
Would you ask him to return?

1800
02:25:48,093 --> 02:25:50,357
No, I don't think I will.

1801
02:25:51,997 --> 02:25:55,194
Will you try to have him return?

1802
02:25:57,269 --> 02:26:01,729
- No, I don't think I'll try.
- You don't think you'll try?

1803
02:26:02,808 --> 02:26:05,800
No, I don't think so.

1804
02:26:05,978 --> 02:26:10,779
The $170,000 paid out to the Air Force
in the form of hotel suites...

1805
02:26:10,950 --> 02:26:12,577
...TWA stock...

1806
02:26:13,252 --> 02:26:15,720
...female companionship.

1807
02:26:15,921 --> 02:26:20,221
Now, is it possible that
these could be considered bribes?

1808
02:26:20,893 --> 02:26:23,225
I suppose you could call them that, yes.

1809
02:26:24,597 --> 02:26:25,962
Would you repeat that?

1810
02:26:26,932 --> 02:26:30,766
I said, I suppose you could
consider them bribes, yes.

1811
02:26:33,405 --> 02:26:36,238
Well, would you like
to explain that, Mr. Hughes?

1812
02:26:37,943 --> 02:26:42,141
I'm afraid you don't know how
the aviation business works, senator.

1813
02:26:42,314 --> 02:26:46,751
See, wining and dining Air Force dignitaries
is common in our business.

1814
02:26:46,919 --> 02:26:51,856
It's because we all want the big contracts.
All the major aircraft companies do it.

1815
02:26:52,024 --> 02:26:54,185
I don't know whether
it's a good system...

1816
02:26:54,360 --> 02:26:58,592
...I just know it's not illegal.
You, senator, you are the lawmaker.

1817
02:26:58,764 --> 02:27:03,360
If you pass a law that states no one
can entertain Air Force officers, well, hell...

1818
02:27:03,535 --> 02:27:05,696
...I'd be happy to abide by it.

1819
02:27:07,773 --> 02:27:11,209
Your story is a pack of lies. I can
tear it apart if allowed to cross-examine.

1820
02:27:12,544 --> 02:27:16,810
- We're not gonna have this bickering.
- Yes. Somewhere between two and 500...

1821
02:27:16,982 --> 02:27:20,850
...if you'll let me get started.
- lf you believe your wealth and power...

1822
02:27:21,020 --> 02:27:24,979
...can intimidate any member
of this committee, you're mistaken.

1823
02:27:25,157 --> 02:27:28,058
- Now submit your questions.
- I'll put this very simply.

1824
02:27:28,227 --> 02:27:31,253
On February 12th,
at the Mayflower Hotel...

1825
02:27:31,430 --> 02:27:37,027
...did you or did you not tell me
that if I were to sell TWA to Pan Am...

1826
02:27:37,202 --> 02:27:40,000
...that this entire investigation
would be called off?

1827
02:27:40,172 --> 02:27:43,903
I did not. And I have asked you
to submit your questions in writing.

1828
02:27:44,076 --> 02:27:48,012
- How long have you known Juan Trippe?
- I've known him for some time now.

1829
02:27:48,180 --> 02:27:52,913
- And that's not the question.
- Is it not true that Juan donated $20,000...

1830
02:27:53,085 --> 02:27:57,317
...to your last campaign? I mean,
he spoke to me as if you worked for him.

1831
02:28:01,360 --> 02:28:03,225
I have a personal friendship with...

1832
02:28:03,395 --> 02:28:06,831
Is it true you accept free Pan Am tickets
to circle the globe...

1833
02:28:06,999 --> 02:28:09,934
...in support of your C.A.B. bill?
- No, it is not true.

1834
02:28:10,102 --> 02:28:14,300
Well, who wrote that bill, senator?
Who actually wrote the C.A.B. bill?

1835
02:28:14,473 --> 02:28:18,409
- The actual words. Did you write them?
- This is not how these hearings...

1836
02:28:18,577 --> 02:28:22,673
...are gonna be conducted.
- I have it. Maybe it'll refresh your memory.

1837
02:28:22,848 --> 02:28:27,410
"Bill S-987 to amend
the Civil Aeronautics Act."

1838
02:28:27,586 --> 02:28:30,419
Now, you introduced this bill
to the Senate.

1839
02:28:32,891 --> 02:28:35,018
A lot of words.

1840
02:28:35,361 --> 02:28:37,352
You write all of them?

1841
02:28:37,963 --> 02:28:40,830
- Did you write any of them, senator?
- Now, look...

1842
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:43,992
Now, this entire bill was written
by Pan Am executives...

1843
02:28:44,169 --> 02:28:48,435
...and designed to give that airline
a monopoly on international travel.

1844
02:28:48,607 --> 02:28:53,067
You've been flogging this bill all around
the world on their behalf, have you not?

1845
02:28:53,245 --> 02:28:57,011
I have duties that take me
all over the world, Mr. Hughes.

1846
02:28:57,182 --> 02:29:02,210
Well, what the hell does a senator
from Maine need to visit Peru for?

1847
02:29:02,955 --> 02:29:07,619
I was seeking outlets for our trade goods.

1848
02:29:08,594 --> 02:29:11,563
Buy a lot of lobsters down there, do they?

1849
02:29:14,133 --> 02:29:17,933
Senator, how many times have you visited
Trippe's office in New York...

1850
02:29:18,103 --> 02:29:20,469
...in the last three months?

1851
02:29:23,075 --> 02:29:25,839
Would you like me to tell you, senator?

1852
02:29:26,578 --> 02:29:30,036
All right, this has gone on long enough.
Juan is a great American.

1853
02:29:30,215 --> 02:29:34,584
His airline has advanced the cause
of commercial aviation for decades.

1854
02:29:34,753 --> 02:29:40,282
Juan Trippe is a patriot. Juan Trippe is not
a man who is interested in making money.

1855
02:29:41,193 --> 02:29:44,959
Well, I'm sure his stockholders
would be happy to hear that.

1856
02:29:46,632 --> 02:29:48,122
We're gonna clear this room.

1857
02:29:48,700 --> 02:29:53,467
<i>This is James McNamara speaking to you</i>
<i>from the Hughes 2000-ton flying boat...</i>

1858
02:29:53,639 --> 02:29:56,802
<i>... the world's largest aircraft.</i>
<i>This is the sky giant...</i>

1859
02:29:56,975 --> 02:30:01,071
<i>... which has prompted Congress to</i>
<i>investigate the war contracts of Mr. Hughes.</i>

1860
02:30:01,246 --> 02:30:04,807
<i>Before boarding the craft,</i>
<i>Mr. Hughes told newsmen that this test...</i>

1861
02:30:04,983 --> 02:30:09,215
<i>... would be solely a taxi experiment.</i>
<i>He said he didn't know what might happen.</i>

1862
02:30:09,388 --> 02:30:11,253
<i>The mammoth flying plywood shell...</i>

1863
02:30:13,325 --> 02:30:17,091
<i>... might ship water under high-speed</i>
<i>taxi pressure. He will not take...</i>

1864
02:30:17,262 --> 02:30:20,561
<i>... the craft into the air until next spring.</i>
<i>The thin man from Culver City...</i>

1865
02:30:20,732 --> 02:30:25,192
<i>... pronounced the craft an unknown quantity.</i>
<i>He has an idea what it can do...</i>

1866
02:30:25,370 --> 02:30:27,395
None of that, now. None of that.

1867
02:30:27,573 --> 02:30:30,474
<i>We are about 5 feet</i>
<i>in back of Mr. Hughes.</i>

1868
02:30:30,642 --> 02:30:34,009
<i>We are looking through</i>
<i>one of the side windows in the cockpit.</i>

1869
02:30:34,179 --> 02:30:36,739
Professor, why don't you
come on up front here.

1870
02:30:37,149 --> 02:30:40,414
<i>In other words, we are 30 feet high</i>
<i>in this aircraft.</i>

1871
02:30:40,586 --> 02:30:45,182
Strap yourself in right there.
You ought to be able to see just great.

1872
02:30:46,191 --> 02:30:49,456
<i>Huge crowds jam the surrounding</i>
<i>shoreline this morning.</i>

1873
02:30:49,628 --> 02:30:52,825
All right, boys, let's fire it up.

1874
02:30:56,702 --> 02:30:58,067
One's good.

1875
02:30:59,338 --> 02:31:01,306
Two's good.

1876
02:31:01,473 --> 02:31:03,168
Three's good.

1877
02:31:03,342 --> 02:31:05,367
Four's good.

1878
02:31:05,544 --> 02:31:07,239
Five's good.

1879
02:31:07,412 --> 02:31:08,902
Six is good.

1880
02:31:09,081 --> 02:31:10,446
Seven's good.

1881
02:31:10,616 --> 02:31:12,516
Eight's good.

1882
02:31:13,585 --> 02:31:17,453
- Advancing master throttles.
- Advancing master throttles.

1883
02:31:19,057 --> 02:31:21,753
<i>As you probably know,</i>
<i>I have to do a great deal...</i>

1884
02:31:21,927 --> 02:31:24,054
<i>... of screaming into our microphone.</i>

1885
02:31:24,229 --> 02:31:28,632
- Understood. Lower it 15 degrees of flaps.
- Lowering 15 degrees of flaps.

1886
02:31:29,268 --> 02:31:33,034
Howard, she's gotta hit 70
to have any kind of chance.

1887
02:31:33,205 --> 02:31:35,469
Yeah, I know. I know.

1888
02:31:35,641 --> 02:31:39,941
<i>It's a beautiful day here off the coast</i>
<i>of Southern California. Blue skies...</i>

1889
02:31:40,112 --> 02:31:43,604
<i>- ... a warm sun...</i>
- Twenty-five miles per hour.

1890
02:31:43,782 --> 02:31:46,046
<i>- And a relatively calm sea...</i>
- Thirty.

1891
02:31:47,686 --> 02:31:48,983
Thirty-five.

1892
02:31:49,154 --> 02:31:53,090
<i>One would think these eight power plants</i>
<i>might shake the craft to pieces...</i>

1893
02:31:53,458 --> 02:31:55,050
Take it easy, Howard.

1894
02:31:57,362 --> 02:32:01,128
- Forty!
- Throttling back for starboard turn 180.

1895
02:32:01,300 --> 02:32:03,666
Throttling back for starboard turn 180.

1896
02:32:08,907 --> 02:32:11,398
<i>The flight crew itself</i>
<i>consists of four men.</i>

1897
02:32:11,577 --> 02:32:15,604
<i>Mr. Hughes, however, has added 11</i>
<i>maintenance men to this maiden taxi test...</i>

1898
02:32:15,781 --> 02:32:21,413
<i>... stationed at various places throughout the</i>
<i>ship, checking points of stress and strain.</i>

1899
02:32:23,855 --> 02:32:25,516
How does she sound, Odie?

1900
02:32:26,425 --> 02:32:28,416
Sounds good, Howard.

1901
02:32:31,730 --> 02:32:33,857
- Professor.
- Yes?

1902
02:32:34,032 --> 02:32:35,932
Would you do me a favor?

1903
02:32:36,401 --> 02:32:40,428
Would you take a look out that window
and tell me what the wind is doing?

1904
02:32:45,477 --> 02:32:49,811
I would say that we have a 15-knot wind.

1905
02:32:49,982 --> 02:32:53,383
Would you call that a headwind,
professor?

1906
02:32:54,086 --> 02:32:56,281
I would, Mr. Hughes.

1907
02:32:56,455 --> 02:33:00,016
<i>We must maintain silence. We must</i>
<i>have quiet during the proceedings.</i>

1908
02:33:00,192 --> 02:33:02,558
Mr. Hughes, will you stand and be sworn?

1909
02:33:02,728 --> 02:33:05,162
<i>Mr. Hughes, did you receive...</i>

1910
02:33:05,330 --> 02:33:11,701
...$43 million to manufacture 100 XF-11
spy planes for the United States Air Force?

1911
02:33:12,971 --> 02:33:14,131
I did.

1912
02:33:14,439 --> 02:33:18,569
How many functional planes did you
deliver to the United States Air Force?

1913
02:33:18,877 --> 02:33:19,866
None.

1914
02:33:20,045 --> 02:33:23,310
Would you lean a little closer
to the microphones, sir?

1915
02:33:23,815 --> 02:33:24,975
None.

1916
02:33:25,150 --> 02:33:29,052
Did you receive $13 million
to manufacture...

1917
02:33:29,221 --> 02:33:34,022
...a prototype of a flying boat
known as The Hercules?

1918
02:33:35,594 --> 02:33:36,856
I did.

1919
02:33:37,029 --> 02:33:39,623
And did you deliver that plane?

1920
02:33:39,931 --> 02:33:41,193
I did not.

1921
02:33:42,301 --> 02:33:45,566
So by your admission
in this chamber, Mr. Hughes...

1922
02:33:45,737 --> 02:33:48,672
...you have received $56 million...

1923
02:33:49,041 --> 02:33:53,273
...from the United States government
for planes you never delivered.

1924
02:33:54,112 --> 02:33:55,875
That is correct.

1925
02:33:58,317 --> 02:34:01,309
Well, excuse me for asking,
Mr. Hughes...

1926
02:34:01,486 --> 02:34:03,420
...but where did all that money go?

1927
02:34:03,822 --> 02:34:08,350
Well, it went into the planes, senator.
And a lot more.

1928
02:34:08,527 --> 02:34:13,328
More? Do tell, Mr. Hughes,
what other larcenies did you commit?

1929
02:34:13,532 --> 02:34:18,799
I mean, I put my money
into the planes, senator. My money.

1930
02:34:21,273 --> 02:34:25,835
- See, the thing is that I care...
- Your personal finances are not...

1931
02:34:26,011 --> 02:34:28,707
Let him speak.

1932
02:34:32,050 --> 02:34:33,381
Proceed, Mr. Hughes.

1933
02:34:35,487 --> 02:34:40,789
See, the thing is,
I care very much about aviation.

1934
02:34:41,059 --> 02:34:45,723
It has been the great joy of my life. That's
why I put my own money into these planes.

1935
02:34:45,897 --> 02:34:50,300
And I've lost millions, senator,
and I'll go on losing millions. It's just...

1936
02:34:50,469 --> 02:34:52,403
...what I do.

1937
02:34:52,738 --> 02:34:57,072
Now, if I've lost a lot of the government's
money during the war, I hope folks...

1938
02:34:57,242 --> 02:34:59,836
...will put that into perspective.

1939
02:35:00,011 --> 02:35:03,344
More than 60 other airplanes ordered
from such firms as...

1940
02:35:03,515 --> 02:35:07,474
...Lockheed, Douglas, Northrop and Boeing
never saw action either.

1941
02:35:07,652 --> 02:35:14,148
In all, more than $800 million was spent
during the war on planes that never flew.

1942
02:35:14,326 --> 02:35:19,457
Over 6 billion on other weapons
that were never delivered.

1943
02:35:19,631 --> 02:35:24,091
Yet Hughes Aircraft, with her 56 million...

1944
02:35:24,269 --> 02:35:26,760
...is the only firm
under investigation here.

1945
02:35:26,938 --> 02:35:32,501
I cannot help but think that has a little more
to do with TWA than planes that did not fly.

1946
02:35:32,711 --> 02:35:36,647
- You've made your point, Mr. Hughes.
- One second. I have one more thing...

1947
02:35:37,015 --> 02:35:39,279
...to say here to this committee.

1948
02:35:39,451 --> 02:35:41,976
And that has to do with The Hercules.

1949
02:35:42,621 --> 02:35:47,854
Now, I am supposed to be many things
which are not complimentary.

1950
02:35:48,026 --> 02:35:50,085
I am supposed to be capricious.

1951
02:35:50,262 --> 02:35:54,221
I have been called a playboy.
I've even been called an eccentric...

1952
02:35:54,399 --> 02:35:58,631
...but I do not believe that I have
the reputation of being a liar.

1953
02:35:59,604 --> 02:36:02,971
Needless to say, The Hercules
was a monumental undertaking.

1954
02:36:03,141 --> 02:36:05,837
It is the largest plane ever built.

1955
02:36:06,011 --> 02:36:09,879
It is over five stories tall with a wingspan
longer than a football field.

1956
02:36:10,048 --> 02:36:11,913
That's more than a city block.

1957
02:36:12,083 --> 02:36:16,611
Now, I put the sweat of my life into this.
I got my reputation all rolled up in it.

1958
02:36:16,788 --> 02:36:20,246
I have stated several times
that if The Hercules fails to fly...

1959
02:36:20,425 --> 02:36:24,521
...I will leave this country
and never come back. And I mean it.

1960
02:36:25,897 --> 02:36:29,731
Now, Senator Brewster,
you can subpoena me...

1961
02:36:29,901 --> 02:36:34,736
...you can arrest me, you can even claim
I've folded up and taken a run-out powder...

1962
02:36:34,906 --> 02:36:39,900
...but, well, I've had just about enough
of this nonsense. Good afternoon.

1963
02:36:40,345 --> 02:36:41,573
I had to do it.

1964
02:36:41,780 --> 02:36:45,716
- Mr. Hughes.
- Mr. Hughes.

1965
02:36:45,884 --> 02:36:48,444
I'd love to see The Hercules in the air.

1966
02:36:48,620 --> 02:36:51,020
Thank you, thank you so much.

1967
02:37:00,031 --> 02:37:01,089
Switch it off.

1968
02:37:01,266 --> 02:37:04,099
- The hearings aren't over yet.
- The hearings are over.

1969
02:37:06,838 --> 02:37:09,671
The airline bill will be defeated
in the Senate.

1970
02:37:09,841 --> 02:37:12,901
TWA will begin flights from
New York to Paris...

1971
02:37:13,078 --> 02:37:18,880
...then on to Moscow, to Japan,
to Hawaii, to Los Angeles...

1972
02:37:21,019 --> 02:37:23,044
...to New York.

1973
02:37:26,892 --> 02:37:28,553
Fuck.

1974
02:37:32,597 --> 02:37:36,431
- Power coming up.
- Power coming up.

1975
02:37:39,738 --> 02:37:42,002
<i>Howard Hughes has just alerted us.</i>

1976
02:37:42,173 --> 02:37:46,735
<i>He has asked everyone to hold on.</i>
<i>Tremendous horsepower kicking up.</i>

1977
02:37:48,313 --> 02:37:49,439
Let me hear it, Odie.

1978
02:37:49,614 --> 02:37:51,639
Twenty-five miles per hour.

1979
02:37:52,250 --> 02:37:53,478
Thirty.

1980
02:37:53,818 --> 02:37:56,048
<i>Here we go. Here we go.</i>

1981
02:37:56,221 --> 02:37:58,382
- Thirty-five.
<i>- The air-speed indicator...</i>

1982
02:37:58,557 --> 02:38:02,186
<i>... has moved up to 25. Thirty.</i>

1983
02:38:02,594 --> 02:38:04,653
<i>- Thirty-five.</i>
- Forty.

1984
02:38:04,829 --> 02:38:06,660
<i>As he pushes the throttle it's 40.</i>

1985
02:38:06,831 --> 02:38:10,130
- Forty-five.
<i>- Forty-five. More throttle.</i>

1986
02:38:10,302 --> 02:38:12,293
<i>- Forty-five.</i>
- Fifty.

1987
02:38:12,904 --> 02:38:15,372
<i>- It's 50 over a choppy sea.</i>
- Fifty-five.

1988
02:38:15,540 --> 02:38:17,872
<i>It's 55. It's 55.</i>

1989
02:38:18,343 --> 02:38:20,538
- Sixty.
<i>- More throttle. It's 60.</i>

1990
02:38:20,712 --> 02:38:22,441
- Sixty-five.
<i>- Sixty-five.</i>

1991
02:38:27,118 --> 02:38:29,052
- Seventy.
<i>- It's 70.</i>

1992
02:38:29,220 --> 02:38:31,950
- Seventy-five.
<i>- It's 75.</i>

1993
02:38:39,331 --> 02:38:44,633
<i>And something momentarily cuts out.</i>
<i>I believe we are airborne.</i>

1994
02:38:44,803 --> 02:38:48,398
<i>We are airborne, ladies and gentlemen.</i>
<i>I don't believe that Hughes...</i>

1995
02:38:48,573 --> 02:38:51,303
<i>... meant this to be. I don't know.</i>

1996
02:38:53,511 --> 02:38:58,915
<i>And we were really up in the air.</i>
<i>We were really up in the air.</i>

1997
02:39:03,321 --> 02:39:06,722
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the Hughes mammoth aircraft...</i>

1998
02:39:06,891 --> 02:39:11,419
<i>... has flown this afternoon</i>
<i>in Los Angeles Harbor.</i>

1999
02:39:11,596 --> 02:39:15,794
<i>Well, it certainly looks at this moment</i>
<i>that Howard Hughes will be around...</i>

2000
02:39:15,967 --> 02:39:19,835
<i>... the United States for quite</i>
<i>some time to come.</i>

2001
02:39:30,882 --> 02:39:34,909
We must understand that technologies
like these are the way of the future.

2002
02:39:35,086 --> 02:39:38,647
- That's enough questions.
- TWA and Hughes Aircraft are delighted...

2003
02:39:38,823 --> 02:39:42,088
...to have you come here
and witness this wonderful sight.

2004
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:44,455
- Excuse us for just a second.
- All right.

2005
02:39:44,629 --> 02:39:46,620
- So you feel like going to Paris?
- Now?

2006
02:39:46,798 --> 02:39:48,789
TWA is starting up flights to Europe.

2007
02:39:48,967 --> 02:39:52,403
I thought I might pilot the first one.
Ought to be some fun.

2008
02:39:52,570 --> 02:39:55,300
- Lots of shopping in Paris.
- I'll buy you anything.

2009
02:39:55,473 --> 02:39:58,374
You can buy me dinner. How about that?

2010
02:40:00,645 --> 02:40:03,045
Dinner, then. We got a date?

2011
02:40:03,248 --> 02:40:05,580
Okay, baby, you got a date.

2012
02:40:07,218 --> 02:40:11,018
I'll be back in a second,
but don't you go anywhere, now. I mean it.

2013
02:40:11,189 --> 02:40:14,181
All right, listen, boys.
Something new. Jet airplanes.

2014
02:40:14,359 --> 02:40:17,294
- You know about jets?
- No, but it sounds expensive.

2015
02:40:17,462 --> 02:40:19,896
Oh, it will be, but we gotta get started.

2016
02:40:21,166 --> 02:40:23,930
Come on, walk with me.

2017
02:40:24,102 --> 02:40:26,434
Whoever can start utilizing
jet technology...

2018
02:40:26,604 --> 02:40:30,472
...on commercial airliners is gonna win.
What do you know about the science?

2019
02:40:30,642 --> 02:40:35,102
I know a little. I can work something
to show you. Basic turbine stuff.

2020
02:40:39,751 --> 02:40:43,585
Noah, who are those fellas?

2021
02:40:44,489 --> 02:40:46,286
Do they work for me?

2022
02:40:47,625 --> 02:40:49,923
Everybody works for you, Howard.

2023
02:40:56,701 --> 02:41:01,400
Lockheed worked on the F-80. Let's get
Bob Gross and see if he can help us out.

2024
02:41:01,573 --> 02:41:03,871
- What, now?
- Of course now.

2025
02:41:04,042 --> 02:41:06,977
We gotta get into it.
Jets are the way of the future.

2026
02:41:07,145 --> 02:41:10,376
- It's 4:30.
- I talked to Bob last week. He's in New York.

2027
02:41:10,548 --> 02:41:13,142
- So it's 7:30.
- He won't be in the office.

2028
02:41:13,318 --> 02:41:16,515
We'll figure out what hotel he's at.
Do you want a call...

2029
02:41:16,688 --> 02:41:20,180
...or you want some kind of meeting?
- We want a meeting, don't we?

2030
02:41:20,358 --> 02:41:23,623
Do you want me bring him
out here tomorrow, then, Howard?

2031
02:41:24,629 --> 02:41:27,029
- The way of the future.
- Howard?

2032
02:41:27,198 --> 02:41:28,961
- Howard?
- The way of the future.

2033
02:41:30,468 --> 02:41:33,198
- The way of the future.
- Let's take a walk, Howard.

2034
02:41:33,371 --> 02:41:35,305
- Way of the future.
- Give me a hand.

2035
02:41:35,473 --> 02:41:38,909
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

2036
02:41:39,077 --> 02:41:41,511
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

2037
02:41:41,679 --> 02:41:44,239
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

2038
02:41:44,415 --> 02:41:46,883
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

2039
02:41:47,051 --> 02:41:49,519
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

2040
02:41:49,687 --> 02:41:52,053
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

2041
02:41:52,223 --> 02:41:56,182
All right, stay here. I'll be right back.
You understand, Howard?

2042
02:41:56,361 --> 02:41:58,124
The way of the future.

2043
02:41:58,296 --> 02:42:01,925
Guard the door. I'll get a doctor.
No one sees him like this.

2044
02:42:02,100 --> 02:42:04,660
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

2045
02:42:04,836 --> 02:42:07,703
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

2046
02:42:07,872 --> 02:42:10,238
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

2047
02:42:14,379 --> 02:42:16,176
The way of the future.

2048
02:42:22,420 --> 02:42:24,479
<i>You are not safe.</i>

2049
02:42:32,997 --> 02:42:34,225
<i>When I grow up...</i>

2050
02:42:34,799 --> 02:42:37,768
<i>... I'm gonna fly the fastest planes</i>
<i>ever built...</i>

2051
02:42:37,936 --> 02:42:40,530
<i>... make the biggest movies ever...</i>

2052
02:42:40,705 --> 02:42:43,606
<i>... and be the richest man in the world.</i>

2053
02:42:56,888 --> 02:42:59,857
The way of the future.

2054
02:43:07,065 --> 02:43:09,727
The way of the future.

2055
02:43:17,342 --> 02:43:19,537
The way of the future.

2056
02:43:22,614 --> 02:43:24,707
The way of the future.

2057
02:43:26,551 --> 02:43:28,781
The way of the future.

2058
02:43:30,088 --> 02:43:31,646
The way of the future.
