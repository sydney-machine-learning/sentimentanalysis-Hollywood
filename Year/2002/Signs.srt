1
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,698
Where are they?

2
00:03:26,793 --> 00:03:27,824
I don't know.

3
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,377
Dad!

4
00:03:29,462 --> 00:03:31,336
Uncle Merrill!

5
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:34,043
Dad!

6
00:03:38,011 --> 00:03:39,755
Morgan!

7
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:52,429
Bo? Bo?

8
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:55,146
Bo, where's Morgan?

9
00:03:55,237 --> 00:03:56,695
Bo?

10
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,570
Are you in my dream,
too?

11
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,814
...This is not a dr...
... Dad!

12
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,283
Hey...

13
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:03,863
Honey...

14
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,828
Morgan?
What's happening?

15
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,835
The dogs were barking...
woke us up.

16
00:04:15,798 --> 00:04:17,624
Are you hurt?

17
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:20,634
I think God did it.

18
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,794
Did what, Morgan?

19
00:05:41,796 --> 00:05:44,796
Look, Lee, I don't even care
if it was him.

20
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:47,419
And you can just have
a word with him,

21
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:49,336
and that'd be enough for me.

22
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:53,294
See, it was strange
finding the crops that way.

23
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:55,678
The kids were confused by it,

24
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:58,092
and, uh, it'd sure take
the strangeness away

25
00:05:58,185 --> 00:06:01,934
if I knew it was just Lionel and the
Wolfington brothers messing around,

26
00:06:02,022 --> 00:06:04,513
that's all.

27
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:06,684
At the movies?

28
00:06:06,777 --> 00:06:09,980
Are you sure?

29
00:06:10,072 --> 00:06:11,482
Alright, then.

30
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:13,613
Uh, thanks for
your patience, Lee.

31
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,028
Yeah. Bye.

32
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:22,498
Houdini peed.
I think he's sick.

33
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,991
Why don't you
take him outside?

34
00:06:25,086 --> 00:06:26,366
I'll call Dr. Crawford.

35
00:06:26,462 --> 00:06:27,838
He doesn't treat animals.

36
00:06:27,922 --> 00:06:30,674
Well, he'll know
what to do.

37
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:48,399
Oh. That was quick,
Caroline.

38
00:06:48,483 --> 00:06:50,274
I only called you folks
two hours ago.

39
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,981
Old Mrs. Kendleman
twisted her ankle,

40
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,561
as she puts it,
diving for her life

41
00:06:55,657 --> 00:07:00,033
when a bunch of school kids rode
down the sidewalk on skateboards.

42
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:03,203
She went down to Thornton's
store this morning

43
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,242
and started spitting
on the new skateboards.

44
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:07,708
Spitting!

45
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:09,370
By the time I got there,

46
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:12,747
Mrs. Kendleman had sprayed
the whole damned place.

47
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,674
And she must have had
a cold or something.

48
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:19,590
I'm telling you,
I won't eat for a week.

49
00:07:21,472 --> 00:07:24,888
So, what happened
to your crops?

50
00:07:28,563 --> 00:07:31,598
Dad's gonna burn these
again.

51
00:07:39,573 --> 00:07:41,399
It's contaminated.

52
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:44,161
You don't even know
what that word means.

53
00:07:46,412 --> 00:07:48,156
It's not contaminated.

54
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:50,785
It's just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.

55
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,452
It tastes funny.

56
00:07:52,544 --> 00:07:54,002
It does not.

57
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:55,995
And besides, he licks
his butt every day.

58
00:07:56,088 --> 00:07:58,128
I don't think
he'll mind.

59
00:08:14,898 --> 00:08:16,688
Houdini?

60
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:18,932
Bo, don't run.

61
00:08:19,026 --> 00:08:20,521
What's wrong, boy?

62
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:23,946
Stop it, Houdini.

63
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:34,447
Look at where
it's bent over, Father.

64
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:37,495
It's not broken.

65
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:42,924
Now, what kind of machine can bend a
stalk of corn over without breaking it?

66
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,498
Can't be by hand.
It's too perfect.

67
00:08:45,593 --> 00:08:49,176
It doesn't sound much like Lionel
Prichard and the Wolfington brothers.

68
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:50,806
They can't take a piss

69
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,844
without wetting
the front of their pants.

70
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:57,138
I don't think anyone else
around here has had any problems.

71
00:08:57,229 --> 00:09:00,099
I was over at Theo Henry's
farm yesterday afternoon,

72
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:02,230
and he would have
mentioned something.

73
00:09:02,317 --> 00:09:04,642
Why were you
at Theo's place?

74
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:08,900
Some animals around the county
have been acting funny...

75
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:11,944
and some of them
violent.

76
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:13,909
What is it, a virus?

77
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:16,533
I don't think so,
Father.

78
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:20,287
They're more edgy,
you know, and alert.

79
00:09:20,376 --> 00:09:23,413
It's almost like they act when
they smell a predator around...

80
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:25,543
peeing on themselves
and everything.

81
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,055
Caroline...

82
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:41,559
please stop calling me
"Father. "

83
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:43,105
What's wrong?

84
00:09:43,189 --> 00:09:45,762
I don't hear my children.

85
00:10:14,552 --> 00:10:17,506
He fell on me.

86
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:20,265
He wanted to kill Bo.

87
00:10:36,865 --> 00:10:38,608
Did he hurt you?

88
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,277
No.

89
00:10:45,248 --> 00:10:47,821
I'm so sorry, Morgan.

90
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,391
Where were you?

91
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,974
Houdini's sick.

92
00:11:12,064 --> 00:11:14,935
Tie Isabel up to the
back of the shed, please,

93
00:11:15,026 --> 00:11:18,228
and make sure
the knot's very tight.

94
00:11:58,525 --> 00:12:03,602
What's the matter?

95
00:12:03,697 --> 00:12:05,985
There's a monster
outside my room.

96
00:12:06,074 --> 00:12:08,825
Can I have
a glass of water?

97
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:12,326
What's wrong with the water
next to your bed?

98
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:15,034
It tastes old.

99
00:12:47,613 --> 00:12:50,151
What are you thinking
about?

100
00:12:52,576 --> 00:12:57,321
Why do you talk to Mom
when you're by yourself?

101
00:12:59,499 --> 00:13:01,990
Makes me feel better.

102
00:13:02,085 --> 00:13:05,536
Does she ever
answer back?

103
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,838
No.

104
00:13:13,596 --> 00:13:17,842
She never answers me
either.

105
00:13:33,364 --> 00:13:34,858
What?

106
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:39,445
Lionel Prichard and the
Wolfington brothers are back.

107
00:13:39,537 --> 00:13:41,743
It's time for
an arse-whupping.

108
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:44,998
This is not an intelligent
way to approach this.

109
00:13:45,084 --> 00:13:47,540
Lee is a friend of mine.
This is his son.

110
00:13:47,628 --> 00:13:49,585
Yeah, we'll be doing Lee
a favour.

111
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:51,830
Alright, listen...
we both go outside,

112
00:13:51,923 --> 00:13:54,414
move around the house
in opposite directions.

113
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:56,466
We act crazy,
insane with anger...

114
00:13:56,553 --> 00:13:58,345
make them crap
in their pants,

115
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:01,430
force them around till we
meet up on the other side.

116
00:14:01,516 --> 00:14:02,761
Explain "act crazy. "

117
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,594
You know,
curse and stuff.

118
00:14:04,686 --> 00:14:05,966
You want me to curse?

119
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:08,469
You don't mean it.
It's just for show.

120
00:14:08,564 --> 00:14:09,762
What?

121
00:14:09,857 --> 00:14:11,316
Well, it won't be
convincing.

122
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,227
It doesn't sound natural
when I curse.

123
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:15,940
Just make noises, then.

124
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:17,405
Explain "noises. "

125
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:19,647
Are you gonna do this
or what?

126
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:21,983
No, I'm not.

127
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:24,746
Alright, you want them stealing
something in the house next time?

128
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:26,205
On the count of three...

129
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:27,320
...1...
... Alright.

130
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:28,529
2... 3!

131
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,958
Aaah!
I'm insane with anger!

132
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:36,288
We're gonna beat
your arse, bitch!

133
00:14:41,137 --> 00:14:43,710
We're gonna tear
your head off!

134
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:45,633
I'm losing my mind!

135
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,684
It's time for
an arse-whupping!

136
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:57,310
I cursed.

137
00:14:57,402 --> 00:14:59,110
I heard.

138
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:05,197
How did he get...

139
00:15:19,798 --> 00:15:22,336
Are you sure
this is Lionel Prichard?

140
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:42,475
You like that?

141
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:48,063
You got an old
baby monitor around?

142
00:15:48,158 --> 00:15:50,151
Bo had an old
baby monitor.

143
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:53,577
You can use Bo's baby monitor
as a walkie-talkie.

144
00:15:53,663 --> 00:15:55,822
...You can?
... Mm-hmm.

145
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,073
It only works one way,
but that'll do fine.

146
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:04,838
That is, until someone gets you an old
walkie-talkie left over at the station.

147
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:06,299
Stop! It's hideous!

148
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,463
Get it off!

149
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:08,749
I- I know what to do.

150
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,720
Hey, Bo...

151
00:16:11,806 --> 00:16:13,964
turn that down till
Officer Paski leaves.

152
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:15,173
Doy-da!

153
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:19,977
You're too old
to still be doing this.

154
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:22,269
You take a glass of water,
and you finish it.

155
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,396
Now, what's wrong
with this one?

156
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,228
It has dust in it.

157
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:28,027
This one?

158
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,487
A hair.

159
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,948
This one?

160
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:34,198
Morgan took a sip, and
it has his amoebas in it.

161
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,740
My turn.

162
00:16:38,997 --> 00:16:42,746
So, how are you, Merrill?

163
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,661
Fine.

164
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:48,585
How is work at
the gas station?

165
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:50,500
Stimulating.

166
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,836
I never got a chance
to tell you,

167
00:16:56,931 --> 00:17:01,309
but I-I thought your moving in
here with your brother after...

168
00:17:01,394 --> 00:17:03,683
it was a nice thing
to do.

169
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:06,807
Well, I don't think
I'm helping much.

170
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,063
You are.

171
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:32,626
Sorry.

172
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:36,926
Okay, so far I have,
"It was very dark. "

173
00:17:37,011 --> 00:17:39,584
Yes, it was.

174
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,512
You can't describe him
at all?

175
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:46,174
Don't you think
that's kind of odd?

176
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,021
A little.

177
00:17:49,105 --> 00:17:53,317
I don't know whether to look
for a giant or a midget.

178
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:55,440
No, he definitely
wasn't a midget.

179
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:57,272
Okay.

180
00:17:57,363 --> 00:18:00,981
So he was tall?

181
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:04,740
I- I would say so, yes.

182
00:18:04,828 --> 00:18:06,406
Probably.

183
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:08,536
Over 6 feet?

184
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:12,458
It was very dark.

185
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:14,169
Yes, it was.

186
00:18:14,254 --> 00:18:17,458
How certain are you
that this was a male?

187
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:20,336
Oh, I don't know... I don't know
any girls who could run like that.

188
00:18:20,427 --> 00:18:21,885
I don't know, Merrill.

189
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:24,757
I've seen some of those women
on the Olympics.

190
00:18:24,848 --> 00:18:26,674
They can run like
the wind.

191
00:18:26,766 --> 00:18:29,637
This guy got on our roof
in, like, a second.

192
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:31,684
O- Our roof
is 10 feet high.

193
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,855
They have women's high jumping
in the Olympics.

194
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,229
They got these
Scandinavian women

195
00:18:37,318 --> 00:18:39,144
who can jump clean over me.

196
00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:45,361
Caroline, I know you're
making a point here,

197
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,489
but I just don't know
what it is.

198
00:18:47,577 --> 00:18:50,910
An out-of-town woman stopped by
the diner yesterday afternoon

199
00:18:50,997 --> 00:18:52,871
and started yelling
and cussing

200
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:55,709
because they didn't have
her favourite cigarettes

201
00:18:55,793 --> 00:18:57,916
at the vending machine.

202
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:02,630
She scared a couple
of the customers.

203
00:19:02,716 --> 00:19:05,503
No one's seen her since.

204
00:19:05,594 --> 00:19:07,004
And my point is,

205
00:19:07,096 --> 00:19:10,096
we don't know anything
about the person you saw,

206
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:14,226
and we should just keep
all possibilities available.

207
00:19:16,562 --> 00:19:18,271
Dad, where's the remote?

208
00:19:18,356 --> 00:19:19,815
I don't know, baby.

209
00:19:19,899 --> 00:19:22,900
Why don't you check
in the sofa cushions?

210
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:24,563
Excluding the possibility

211
00:19:24,654 --> 00:19:26,979
that a female Scandinavian
Olympian

212
00:19:27,073 --> 00:19:30,109
was running around outside
our house last night,

213
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:32,406
what else might be
a possibility?

214
00:19:32,494 --> 00:19:34,652
I'm not done asking
questions,

215
00:19:34,746 --> 00:19:37,237
and I don't appreciate
sarcasm.

216
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:40,869
Do you two have anyone

217
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,329
who might have a grudge
or something against you...

218
00:19:44,422 --> 00:19:45,750
maybe a-a church member

219
00:19:45,841 --> 00:19:47,797
who... who might
not have liked

220
00:19:47,884 --> 00:19:50,719
the fact that
you left the church?

221
00:19:53,306 --> 00:19:55,262
I don't think so.

222
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:56,808
Okay, I was out of line

223
00:19:56,893 --> 00:19:59,300
with the whole female-
Scandinavian-Olympian thing.

224
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:02,680
It's just,
I'm pretty strong,

225
00:20:02,773 --> 00:20:04,647
and I'm pretty fast.

226
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:08,232
And I was running
as fast as I could,

227
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,946
and this guy, he was...
he was just toying with us.

228
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:15,784
There's only food
under the sofa.

229
00:20:15,868 --> 00:20:17,411
Baby, why don't you

230
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:19,701
just change the channel
on the television?

231
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:20,737
I did.

232
00:20:20,831 --> 00:20:22,029
And?

233
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:26,074
Same show's
on every station.

234
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:29,918
Every station?

235
00:20:32,593 --> 00:20:38,631
Bo, turn up the volume.

236
00:20:38,723 --> 00:20:41,095
Crop signs first emerged
in the late '70s

237
00:20:41,184 --> 00:20:43,853
with renewed interest
in extraterrestrial life.

238
00:20:43,936 --> 00:20:47,305
They died out
by the early '80s,

239
00:20:47,398 --> 00:20:49,391
dismissed as hoaxes.

240
00:20:49,484 --> 00:20:52,651
This new resurgence
is wholly different.

241
00:20:52,737 --> 00:20:55,856
The speed and the quantity
in which it has appeared

242
00:20:55,948 --> 00:20:59,068
implies the coordination
of hundreds of individuals

243
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:00,404
over many countries.

244
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:07,158
There are only a limited
number of explanations.

245
00:21:07,251 --> 00:21:11,663
Either this is one of the most
elaborate hoaxes ever created,

246
00:21:11,754 --> 00:21:15,253
or basically...

247
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,378
it's for real.

248
00:21:24,142 --> 00:21:27,391
Extraterrestrials.

249
00:21:27,477 --> 00:21:32,269
What in God's name
is going on?

250
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:35,643
I did some research
after I saw your crops.

251
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:39,899
Two or three guys can make a design the
size of the one in your field overnight

252
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,362
using just
boards and ropes.

253
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,944
Really?

254
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:47,285
That's how these things
have been done in the past.

255
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,945
But there are
so many now.

256
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:53,492
How could so many people
be in on it?

257
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,255
I can't think straight.

258
00:21:57,339 --> 00:21:59,332
I'm... I'm gonna go back
to the station

259
00:21:59,425 --> 00:22:02,176
and have a cup of Edgar's coffee
and... and try to think clear.

260
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,253
And after that, I'll...

261
00:22:04,346 --> 00:22:06,386
I might make some calls.

262
00:22:06,473 --> 00:22:09,473
But I'll tell you something...
what I said in there, it still goes.

263
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:11,468
Your... your family
has been through a lot.

264
00:22:11,561 --> 00:22:14,811
And the last thing
these children need to do

265
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:18,895
is worry about some crazy
things happening in the world.

266
00:22:18,985 --> 00:22:20,609
Now, take them into town

267
00:22:20,694 --> 00:22:24,645
and get their minds and your
mind on everyday things, hmm?

268
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,318
Good medicine.

269
00:22:26,408 --> 00:22:29,445
That's good advice.

270
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:35,288
And you take care
of yourself...

271
00:22:35,376 --> 00:22:37,913
Graham.

272
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:51,132
The footage you're watching
was shot yesterday afternoon

273
00:22:51,224 --> 00:22:53,381
by a 34-year-old local
cameraman in Bangalore,

274
00:22:53,475 --> 00:22:55,349
a southern city of India.

275
00:22:55,436 --> 00:22:58,009
It's the 18th reported
crop sign

276
00:22:58,105 --> 00:23:01,474
found in that country
in the last 72 hours.

277
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:08,402
Uncle Merrill, will you
turn on the radio?

278
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:12,072
They are signs intended
to be seen from the sky...

279
00:23:13,953 --> 00:23:18,165
No radio either.
Just for a while.

280
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:47,314
Book money?

281
00:23:47,401 --> 00:23:49,311
Sure.

282
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:54,151
Just one.

283
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:05,120
Be back for pizza
in 15.

284
00:24:08,379 --> 00:24:12,294
It's just a bunch
of crock.

285
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:16,084
They're trying to sell sodas.
It's plain and simple.

286
00:24:16,179 --> 00:24:18,551
Been watching these reports
since morning.

287
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:21,095
I have seen 12 soda
commercials so far...

288
00:24:21,183 --> 00:24:23,140
12!

289
00:24:23,227 --> 00:24:25,599
You have any books
on extraterrestrials?

290
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:28,522
Now, don't tell me you believe
this horse manure.

291
00:24:28,607 --> 00:24:31,014
As a matter of fact,
I think we have one.

292
00:24:31,109 --> 00:24:33,102
Came by mistake
in a shipment...

293
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:35,520
decided to keep it
for the city people.

294
00:24:35,614 --> 00:24:39,314
Last row, third book
on the left, honey.

295
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:42,612
Why is no one
saying the obvious?

296
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:44,281
These are just copycats.

297
00:24:44,372 --> 00:24:47,123
Someone somewhere does
the first one...

298
00:24:47,207 --> 00:24:50,209
It was asthma medicine,
right, Father?

299
00:24:50,294 --> 00:24:51,836
For Morgan Hess.

300
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,376
And it's not "Father"
anymore.

301
00:24:54,464 --> 00:24:57,798
In less than an hour, a couple hundred
people get the same brilliant idea,

302
00:24:57,884 --> 00:25:03,389
and here we are, on
the verge of mass hysteria.

303
00:25:07,685 --> 00:25:10,306
Can I ask you a favour,
Father?

304
00:25:10,397 --> 00:25:13,267
I need to clear
my conscience.

305
00:25:13,357 --> 00:25:15,315
Will you listen to me?

306
00:25:15,401 --> 00:25:19,268
Tracey... I am not
a reverend anymore.

307
00:25:19,363 --> 00:25:22,649
I haven't been
for six months.

308
00:25:22,741 --> 00:25:24,983
You know this.

309
00:25:25,077 --> 00:25:27,235
All this stuff on TV...

310
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:30,495
two girls came in here talking
about the end of the world...

311
00:25:30,582 --> 00:25:33,785
I'm just a little scared.

312
00:25:33,877 --> 00:25:38,170
Please, I need to clear
my conscience.

313
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,056
I've got it figured.

314
00:25:51,393 --> 00:25:52,472
You do?

315
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:54,435
I've had two separate
folks tell me

316
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:57,855
there have been strangers around
these parts last couple nights.

317
00:25:57,941 --> 00:26:00,100
Can't tell
what they look like

318
00:26:00,193 --> 00:26:03,644
'cause they're staying
in the shadows... covertlike.

319
00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:05,730
Nobody's been hurt,
mind you.

320
00:26:05,823 --> 00:26:07,401
And that's the giveaway.

321
00:26:07,492 --> 00:26:08,950
I see.

322
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:10,826
It's called "probing. "

323
00:26:10,911 --> 00:26:12,987
It's a military procedure.

324
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,369
You send out a
reconnaissance group...

325
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:17,580
very small...
to check things out.

326
00:26:17,668 --> 00:26:21,795
Not to engage but
to evaluate the situation...

327
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:24,667
evaluate the level
of danger,

328
00:26:24,758 --> 00:26:27,711
make sure things
are all clear.

329
00:26:27,802 --> 00:26:30,839
Clear for what?

330
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:33,932
For the rest of them.

331
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:39,013
Yeah?

332
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:42,189
You got a pamphlet or
something I can read?

333
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:45,145
Sure.

334
00:26:45,236 --> 00:26:47,312
Thanks.

335
00:26:47,405 --> 00:26:51,816
You didn't used to play
baseball, did ya?

336
00:26:51,908 --> 00:26:54,660
Shit, I know you.
You're Merrill Hess.

337
00:26:54,745 --> 00:26:57,745
I was there the day
you hit that 507-footer

338
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,867
over the left-field wall...
set the record.

339
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:03,248
Man, that thing had
a motor on it.

340
00:27:03,336 --> 00:27:05,375
It's still the record,
right?

341
00:27:05,463 --> 00:27:09,840
Got the bat at home
o- on the wall.

342
00:27:09,925 --> 00:27:12,796
You've got two minor-league
home-run records, don't ya?

343
00:27:12,887 --> 00:27:15,294
Five.

344
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:17,678
Why weren't you in the pros
making stacks of cash

345
00:27:17,766 --> 00:27:20,139
and getting your toes licked
by beautiful women?

346
00:27:20,227 --> 00:27:23,845
'Cause he has another record
most people don't know about.

347
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:26,560
He has the minor-league
strikeout record.

348
00:27:28,693 --> 00:27:30,852
Hello, Lionel.

349
00:27:30,946 --> 00:27:33,401
Merrill's a class-A
screw-up.

350
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:36,443
He would just swing that bat
as hard as he could every time.

351
00:27:36,534 --> 00:27:38,325
Didn't matter what
the coaches said,

352
00:27:38,411 --> 00:27:40,403
didn't matter
who was on base.

353
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:43,165
He would just whip that bat
through the air as hard as he could.

354
00:27:43,249 --> 00:27:46,451
Looked like a lumberjack
chopping down a tree.

355
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:50,458
Merrill here has more
strikeouts than any two players.

356
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:53,252
You really got
the strikeout record?

357
00:28:00,056 --> 00:28:04,054
Felt wrong not to swing.

358
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:17,071
It's contaminated.

359
00:28:17,156 --> 00:28:20,821
Carl, there's something wrong
with our water.

360
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:22,320
Your water's fine.

361
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,495
Bo has this thing
about her drinking water.

362
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,656
She had it
her whole life.

363
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:31,747
It's like a tick people
have, except it's not a tick.

364
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:34,208
Is that right?

365
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:36,290
13!

366
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:38,588
¶ Don't give me
that so-so-soda ¶

367
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:39,838
¶ That same old cola ¶

368
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,800
¶ I wanna pop ¶

369
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,378
...¶ Pop, pop I wanna...
Shasta ¶... I'll take it.

370
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:47,391
I cursed
37 times last week.

371
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:52,683
I said the "F" word a couple
times, but mostly... "shits"

372
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:57,066
and... "bastards. "

373
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:59,986
Is "douche bag"
a curse?

374
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,906
I suppose that would
depend on its usage.

375
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:06,275
How about, "John, you're a
douche bag for kissing Barbara"?

376
00:29:06,368 --> 00:29:08,906
It's a curse.

377
00:29:08,996 --> 00:29:14,121
Then it's not 37.
It's 71.

378
00:29:17,963 --> 00:29:19,208
Pharmacy crowded?

379
00:29:19,297 --> 00:29:20,875
I don't want
any one of you

380
00:29:20,965 --> 00:29:23,254
spending time with
Tracey Abernathy alone.

381
00:29:23,342 --> 00:29:25,217
Is that understood?

382
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,311
Is that him?

383
00:29:51,077 --> 00:29:53,153
Yeah.

384
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:17,506
Who is he?

385
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:51,541
What is it?

386
00:30:51,634 --> 00:30:54,920
It's Bo's baby monitor.

387
00:30:55,012 --> 00:30:56,672
I found it in the basement.

388
00:30:56,765 --> 00:30:59,255
I'm gonna use it
as a walkie-talkie.

389
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:07,888
What if it's catching
a signal from them?

390
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:12,229
It's not.

391
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,696
But it wasn't working.

392
00:31:13,781 --> 00:31:15,938
Morgan, this crop stuff

393
00:31:16,032 --> 00:31:18,868
is about a bunch of nerds who never
had a girlfriend in their lives.

394
00:31:18,952 --> 00:31:21,443
They're, like, 30, and they
work up little codes together,

395
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:24,111
and they analyse Greek mythology
and make up secret societies

396
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:26,828
where other guys who never had
girlfriends before can join in.

397
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:29,623
They do stupid crap
like this to feel special.

398
00:31:29,712 --> 00:31:30,827
It's a scam.

399
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,830
Nerds were doing it
25 years ago,

400
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:35,165
and new nerds
are doing it again.

401
00:31:38,178 --> 00:31:41,630
It's just static, Morgan,
alright.

402
00:31:41,724 --> 00:31:43,348
Turn it up. See.

403
00:31:47,187 --> 00:31:48,728
It's a code.

404
00:31:48,814 --> 00:31:51,185
Why can't they get
girlfriends?

405
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:53,350
Can I see that, please?

406
00:32:00,866 --> 00:32:03,902
It's noise.

407
00:32:03,994 --> 00:32:06,663
It's broken, Morgan. It's
just gonna keep doing this.

408
00:32:06,746 --> 00:32:08,157
Maybe some new
batteries...

409
00:32:08,249 --> 00:32:10,241
We might lose the signal.

410
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,954
This is exactly
what the nerds want.

411
00:32:15,171 --> 00:32:17,045
I'm getting out now.

412
00:32:22,303 --> 00:32:25,470
Nobody move.

413
00:32:28,142 --> 00:32:30,680
Voices.
Did you hear that?

414
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:32,561
Not English, though.

415
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:35,220
You heard the voices,
right, Uncle Merrill?

416
00:32:37,984 --> 00:32:40,605
I heard them, Morgan.

417
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:48,825
Probably picking up
another baby monitor.

418
00:32:48,911 --> 00:32:51,070
That's right.

419
00:32:57,169 --> 00:32:58,580
Let me see it.

420
00:33:00,923 --> 00:33:02,916
Stop!

421
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:15,341
See, this is why
we're not watching TV.

422
00:33:15,436 --> 00:33:17,476
People get obsessed.

423
00:33:17,564 --> 00:33:18,939
I'm letting go now.

424
00:33:19,023 --> 00:33:19,972
No, Dad!

425
00:33:20,066 --> 00:33:21,229
Don't do it!

426
00:33:21,317 --> 00:33:22,941
You'll lose the signal.

427
00:33:24,987 --> 00:33:28,273
Don't let go.

428
00:33:28,366 --> 00:33:31,319
It gets clearer
the higher you hold it.

429
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:37,363
I got it.

430
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,083
Bo, honey, I don't want
you climbing on the car.

431
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,415
Come here.

432
00:33:56,809 --> 00:34:00,178
Stop!

433
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,678
There's two of them
talking.

434
00:35:12,171 --> 00:35:15,208
Isabel, you're gonna
feel very silly

435
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:19,213
when this turns out to be
all just make-believe.

436
00:36:55,727 --> 00:36:59,855
You're wasting your time here!

437
00:36:59,939 --> 00:37:04,648
I'm not gonna report this or
anything you do to my crops

438
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:07,273
to the news or TV or anybody!

439
00:37:09,365 --> 00:37:12,615
You're not going to get famous!

440
00:39:22,324 --> 00:39:24,447
Okay.

441
00:39:24,534 --> 00:39:27,570
Let's turn on the TV.

442
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:35,747
It first
appeared 52 minutes ago.

443
00:39:35,836 --> 00:39:38,672
Mexico City officials
as well as U.S. officials

444
00:39:38,756 --> 00:39:41,330
have confirmed
that these are not aircraft

445
00:39:41,425 --> 00:39:43,667
from either government's
air force.

446
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:47,461
The first sighting was made
by an Air Mexico 747

447
00:39:47,556 --> 00:39:50,343
en route from Mazatlán
to New York

448
00:39:50,433 --> 00:39:54,681
as the unidentified crafts
entered Mexico City air space.

449
00:39:54,771 --> 00:39:57,890
They were not detected by
radar by either country.

450
00:39:57,982 --> 00:40:00,652
The nerds were right.

451
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:03,107
We have to tape this.

452
00:40:06,824 --> 00:40:08,105
My ballet recital.

453
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:11,451
Listen, Bo, this
is very important.

454
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:15,451
Everything people have written about
in science books is going to change.

455
00:40:15,541 --> 00:40:18,744
The history of the world's
future is on the TV right now.

456
00:40:18,836 --> 00:40:22,501
We need to record this so you
can show your children this tape

457
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:24,748
and say you were there.

458
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:26,419
For your children, Bo.

459
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:27,838
My ballet recital.

460
00:40:27,927 --> 00:40:29,006
Dad!

461
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:30,719
Find another tape.

462
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:37,560
Uncle Merrill,
I'm using your tape.

463
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:44,103
You are seeing a live feed

464
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:47,312
from our affiliate
down here in Mexico City.

465
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:51,484
This image has not been
adjusted or enhanced in any way.

466
00:40:51,575 --> 00:40:53,033
What you're seeing is real.

467
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,825
It's unbelievable.

468
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,865
Everything they wrote
in science books

469
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,414
is about to change.

470
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:02,036
I told you.

471
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,923
Some people
are probably thinking

472
00:41:19,017 --> 00:41:20,974
this is the end
of the world.

473
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,935
That's true.

474
00:41:23,021 --> 00:41:26,436
Do you think it could be?

475
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,315
Yes.

476
00:41:28,401 --> 00:41:31,355
How can you say that?

477
00:41:33,447 --> 00:41:36,020
That wasn't
the answer you wanted?

478
00:41:38,744 --> 00:41:41,994
Couldn't you pretend to be
like you used to be?

479
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,654
Give me some comfort.

480
00:41:46,876 --> 00:41:52,914
People break down
into two groups

481
00:41:53,007 --> 00:41:56,044
when they experience
something lucky.

482
00:41:56,135 --> 00:41:59,635
Group number one sees
it as more than luck,

483
00:41:59,722 --> 00:42:01,465
more than coincidence.

484
00:42:01,557 --> 00:42:04,807
They see it as a sign...

485
00:42:04,893 --> 00:42:08,511
evidence that there
is someone up there

486
00:42:08,605 --> 00:42:10,598
watching out for them.

487
00:42:10,691 --> 00:42:14,605
Group number two sees
it as just pure luck,

488
00:42:14,694 --> 00:42:16,355
a happy turn of chance.

489
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:19,400
I'm sure the people
in group number two

490
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:23,191
are looking at those 14 lights
in a very suspicious way.

491
00:42:23,286 --> 00:42:27,497
For them, the situation
isn't 50-50.

492
00:42:27,582 --> 00:42:31,531
Could be bad, could be good.

493
00:42:31,627 --> 00:42:33,287
But deep down,

494
00:42:33,379 --> 00:42:37,127
they feel that
whatever happens,

495
00:42:37,216 --> 00:42:39,541
they're on their own.

496
00:42:39,635 --> 00:42:44,213
And that fills
them with fear.

497
00:42:44,306 --> 00:42:48,766
Yeah,
there are those people.

498
00:42:48,852 --> 00:42:53,560
But there's a whole lot of
people in the group number one.

499
00:42:53,648 --> 00:42:56,898
When they see
those 14 lights,

500
00:42:56,984 --> 00:42:59,772
they're looking at a miracle.

501
00:42:59,863 --> 00:43:05,402
And deep down, they feel that
whatever's going to happen,

502
00:43:05,492 --> 00:43:09,490
there'll be someone
there to help them.

503
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:13,031
And that fills
them with hope.

504
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:17,537
See, what you have to ask yourself
is, what kind of person are you?

505
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:22,504
Are you the kind who
sees signs, sees miracles?

506
00:43:22,592 --> 00:43:26,755
Or do you believe that
people just get lucky?

507
00:43:26,846 --> 00:43:30,215
Or look at the question
this way...

508
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:35,646
is it possible that there
are no coincidences?

509
00:43:42,528 --> 00:43:45,149
I was at this party once.

510
00:43:45,238 --> 00:43:48,193
I'm on the couch
with Randa McKinney.

511
00:43:48,283 --> 00:43:50,655
She was just sitting there

512
00:43:50,744 --> 00:43:54,907
looking beautiful,
staring at me.

513
00:43:54,997 --> 00:43:57,915
I go to lean in
and kiss her...

514
00:43:58,001 --> 00:44:02,377
...and I realise
I have gum in my mouth.

515
00:44:02,462 --> 00:44:05,168
So I turn,
take out the gum,

516
00:44:05,257 --> 00:44:08,958
stuff it in a paper cup
next to the sofa,

517
00:44:09,053 --> 00:44:10,546
and turn around.

518
00:44:10,637 --> 00:44:14,385
Randa McKinney throws up
all over herself.

519
00:44:16,518 --> 00:44:21,227
I knew the second it happened
it was a miracle.

520
00:44:21,314 --> 00:44:25,228
I could have been kissing
her when she threw up.

521
00:44:25,317 --> 00:44:28,402
That would have
scarred me for life.

522
00:44:28,488 --> 00:44:32,485
I may never have recovered.

523
00:44:34,493 --> 00:44:37,328
I'm a miracle man.

524
00:44:37,412 --> 00:44:39,784
Those lights are a miracle.

525
00:44:39,873 --> 00:44:43,871
There you go.

526
00:44:43,961 --> 00:44:48,706
So, which type are you?

527
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:53,506
Do you feel comforted?

528
00:44:53,595 --> 00:44:56,264
Yeah, I do.

529
00:44:56,347 --> 00:44:59,098
Then what does it matter?

530
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,479
I never told you
the last words

531
00:45:08,567 --> 00:45:12,516
that Colleen said
before they let her die.

532
00:45:15,073 --> 00:45:18,572
She said, "See. "

533
00:45:18,659 --> 00:45:24,034
Then her eyes glazed a bit.

534
00:45:24,123 --> 00:45:28,334
And then she said,
"Swing away. "

535
00:45:28,419 --> 00:45:31,704
You know why she said that?

536
00:45:33,841 --> 00:45:37,755
Because the nerve endings in her
brain were firing as she died,

537
00:45:37,844 --> 00:45:42,969
and some random memory of us at one of your
baseball games just popped into her head.

538
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:53,974
There is no one watching
out for us, Merrill.

539
00:45:54,067 --> 00:45:56,606
We are all on our own.

540
00:46:35,482 --> 00:46:37,724
What do you know?

541
00:46:37,818 --> 00:46:40,439
Well, there was an accident...
drunk driving, they weren't sure...

542
00:46:40,529 --> 00:46:42,355
He wasn't drunk.
Ray fell asleep at the wheel.

543
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:44,688
...Is he okay?
... Yeah.

544
00:46:44,782 --> 00:46:47,985
That was the first thing
Colleen asked, too.

545
00:46:48,077 --> 00:46:50,366
She's talking.
What ambulance is she in?

546
00:46:50,454 --> 00:46:52,910
She's not in an ambulance,
Father.

547
00:47:38,667 --> 00:47:40,208
For the kids' protection.

548
00:47:40,293 --> 00:47:42,499
All they were doing was
watching TV from 5.00 a. m.

549
00:47:42,587 --> 00:47:45,160
I felt like they were getting
obsessed, like you said.

550
00:47:45,256 --> 00:47:48,625
They should be playing furry, furry
rabbit or tea party or something.

551
00:47:48,718 --> 00:47:49,962
What's furry, furry rabbit?

552
00:47:50,052 --> 00:47:51,131
It's a game, isn't it?

553
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,964
Anyways, they closed
the schools.

554
00:47:53,055 --> 00:47:55,262
And there's been some
interesting developments.

555
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:56,808
What time is it?

556
00:47:56,892 --> 00:47:58,516
11.00 a. m.

557
00:47:58,602 --> 00:48:01,686
They're gone, but they're
not really gone.

558
00:48:01,772 --> 00:48:03,314
We just can't see them.

559
00:48:03,398 --> 00:48:05,307
Early this morning,
a bird flew into the area

560
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,725
where the lights were
hovering last night.

561
00:48:07,819 --> 00:48:10,523
It stopped dead in the air
and fell straight down.

562
00:48:10,613 --> 00:48:13,282
They caught it on tape. They've
been playing it all morning.

563
00:48:13,366 --> 00:48:16,035
The footage looks like the bird
flew into a wall in the sky.

564
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:18,491
They found the bird. His...
his head was crushed in.

565
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:22,244
They think they have some kind of invisible-shield
thing going, I- like an optical illusion.

566
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:27,575
They're still there,
hovering.

567
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,838
Some people think there's
more of them now...

568
00:48:30,924 --> 00:48:33,462
all over the place,
over us, even.

569
00:48:33,551 --> 00:48:36,469
There's a theory about
the c... the crop circles.

570
00:48:36,555 --> 00:48:40,006
They could be
some kind of...

571
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:42,139
some kind of landmark,

572
00:48:42,226 --> 00:48:46,390
visual mapping system
so they could navigate,

573
00:48:46,481 --> 00:48:49,018
coordinate...

574
00:48:49,108 --> 00:48:51,480
makes sense.

575
00:49:04,623 --> 00:49:06,781
Want to hear a story?

576
00:49:13,714 --> 00:49:17,795
Is it true?

577
00:49:20,346 --> 00:49:23,263
So the aliens can't
read our minds.

578
00:49:23,348 --> 00:49:25,720
Oh.

579
00:49:25,809 --> 00:49:27,967
Oh, of course.

580
00:49:33,942 --> 00:49:36,065
They tell you everything
in this book.

581
00:49:36,152 --> 00:49:38,904
It says they're probably
very small, like my height,

582
00:49:38,988 --> 00:49:40,815
because as their
brains develop,

583
00:49:40,907 --> 00:49:43,149
there was no use
for physical development.

584
00:49:43,243 --> 00:49:45,484
It also says they're
probably vegetarians

585
00:49:45,578 --> 00:49:48,578
because they would have realised
the benefits of such a diet.

586
00:49:48,664 --> 00:49:50,122
Who wrote this book?

587
00:49:50,207 --> 00:49:53,125
Scientists who have been
persecuted for their beliefs.

588
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:54,834
That means
they're unemployed.

589
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,245
If you're gonna make fun
of it, then forget it.

590
00:49:57,338 --> 00:49:59,296
This is serious.

591
00:50:03,261 --> 00:50:06,262
I don't know
what got into me.

592
00:50:06,348 --> 00:50:08,138
There are pictures.

593
00:50:08,224 --> 00:50:10,466
Dr. Bimbu, one of the
authors of the book...

594
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,722
...Bimbu?
... Dad.

595
00:50:11,811 --> 00:50:13,602
I just asked his name.

596
00:50:13,688 --> 00:50:16,474
You had a tone.

597
00:50:16,565 --> 00:50:20,313
He said there are two reasons why
extraterrestrials would visit us...

598
00:50:20,402 --> 00:50:22,774
to make contact in
the spirit of exploration

599
00:50:22,862 --> 00:50:25,318
and furthering the
knowledge of the universe,

600
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:28,112
or the other reason...
they're hostile.

601
00:50:28,201 --> 00:50:31,570
They've used up all the
resources on their planet,

602
00:50:31,663 --> 00:50:34,284
and they're looking to
harvest our planet next.

603
00:50:36,459 --> 00:50:38,368
Here.

604
00:51:07,321 --> 00:51:10,773
Looks a little like
our house, doesn't it?

605
00:51:10,866 --> 00:51:12,776
Same windows.

606
00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:14,860
That's weird.

607
00:51:31,052 --> 00:51:32,630
Yeah, oh, yeah.

608
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,843
That's enough from
Dr. Bimbu for now.

609
00:51:34,931 --> 00:51:37,884
Everybody in this house
needs to calm down

610
00:51:37,975 --> 00:51:40,300
and eat some fruit
or something.

611
00:51:44,107 --> 00:51:45,897
Hello?

612
00:51:45,983 --> 00:51:48,059
Father?

613
00:51:48,152 --> 00:51:50,773
Hello?

614
00:51:50,862 --> 00:51:52,820
Hello?!

615
00:52:12,425 --> 00:52:14,464
I'm going out
for a few minutes.

616
00:52:14,552 --> 00:52:16,709
No one leaves this house...
no one.

617
00:52:16,804 --> 00:52:18,381
Where you going?

618
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:20,714
...Ray Reddy's house.

619
00:52:20,808 --> 00:52:21,970
Why?

620
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:24,384
I think
he just called here.

621
00:52:31,734 --> 00:52:35,186
You don't think
something bad will happen,

622
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:36,904
do you, Morgan?

623
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:41,283
Why? You have one of
your feelings again?

624
00:52:43,704 --> 00:52:45,447
Is it bad?

625
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:51,414
I won't let anything bad
happen to you.

626
00:52:51,503 --> 00:52:54,421
I don't want you to die.

627
00:52:54,506 --> 00:52:57,625
Who said I was gonna die?

628
00:52:59,761 --> 00:53:02,168
Who said I was gonna die?

629
00:54:24,424 --> 00:54:26,250
Hello, Ray.

630
00:54:42,274 --> 00:54:44,812
What happened?

631
00:54:44,902 --> 00:54:48,520
I wrote your number
down to call you.

632
00:54:51,407 --> 00:54:54,823
It's been sitting next to
the phone for 6 months.

633
00:54:57,998 --> 00:55:00,666
When I knew it was
inside the house...

634
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:05,661
I couldn't think of any other
number to call. I panicked.

635
00:55:05,754 --> 00:55:08,423
Thank you for coming,
Father.

636
00:55:08,507 --> 00:55:11,177
You're welcome, Ray.

637
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:14,130
I worked so long
that night.

638
00:55:14,221 --> 00:55:18,218
I've never fallen asleep
driving before...

639
00:55:18,308 --> 00:55:19,588
never since.

640
00:55:19,685 --> 00:55:20,633
Don't.

641
00:55:20,726 --> 00:55:22,554
Most of the ride home,

642
00:55:22,645 --> 00:55:26,595
there wasn't a car in sight
in either direction.

643
00:55:26,691 --> 00:55:29,478
If I'd have
fallen asleep then,

644
00:55:29,569 --> 00:55:33,613
I would have ended up in
a ditch with a headache.

645
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:37,741
And it had to be at that
right moment...

646
00:55:37,827 --> 00:55:42,369
that 10, 15 seconds when
I passed her walking.

647
00:55:42,455 --> 00:55:46,204
It was like
it was meant to be.

648
00:55:54,592 --> 00:55:57,165
I guess if this is
the end of the world,

649
00:55:57,262 --> 00:55:59,384
I'm screwed, right?

650
00:55:59,471 --> 00:56:02,224
People who kill
reverends' wives

651
00:56:02,308 --> 00:56:07,100
aren't exactly ushered to the
front of the line in Heaven.

652
00:56:09,773 --> 00:56:11,896
Wh... Where
are you going, Ray?

653
00:56:13,527 --> 00:56:16,064
To the lake.

654
00:56:16,154 --> 00:56:19,819
The way I see it...

655
00:56:19,907 --> 00:56:22,825
these places marked
in crops and such...

656
00:56:22,911 --> 00:56:25,484
none of them are
really near water.

657
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:29,659
I don't think
they like water.

658
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:32,751
Can't be any worse
than here.

659
00:56:32,837 --> 00:56:36,620
Did you see something, Ray?

660
00:56:38,008 --> 00:56:40,048
I know what I've
done to you.

661
00:56:40,135 --> 00:56:42,377
I made you question
your faith.

662
00:56:44,848 --> 00:56:49,176
I'm truly sorry for what
I've done to you and yours.

663
00:56:58,945 --> 00:57:00,652
Alright.

664
00:57:03,073 --> 00:57:05,031
And don't open
my pantry, Father.

665
00:57:05,117 --> 00:57:07,786
I found one of them in
there and locked him in.

666
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:20,207
The startling footage
we're about to show you

667
00:57:20,298 --> 00:57:22,670
was photographed by a
42-year-old, Romero Valadarez.

668
00:57:22,758 --> 00:57:24,632
This video was taken
yesterday afternoon

669
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:26,296
at his son's 7 th birthday

670
00:57:26,387 --> 00:57:28,012
in the city of
Passo Fundo, Brazil.

671
00:57:28,097 --> 00:57:30,553
It was sent to the local
news bureau there

672
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:33,558
and sent to us via satellite
just a few minutes ago.

673
00:57:33,644 --> 00:57:36,894
All initial opinions are
this is genuine.

674
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:40,184
What you're about to see
may disturb you.

675
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,149
Oh!

676
00:59:22,871 --> 00:59:24,699
Hello?

677
00:59:32,589 --> 00:59:35,874
The police are here.
I am with them.

678
00:59:35,967 --> 00:59:38,174
I am a police officer.

679
00:59:40,263 --> 00:59:44,130
I just want to
talk with you.

680
00:59:44,225 --> 00:59:47,641
We know all about the hoax.

681
00:59:47,729 --> 00:59:51,773
We already took some of your
friends downtown in a paddy waggon.

682
00:59:57,029 --> 01:00:00,232
Just tell us your name
and why you did it,

683
01:00:00,323 --> 01:00:04,155
and we'll give you the same
deal we gave the others.

684
01:00:04,245 --> 01:00:06,913
Don't throw your
life away, son.

685
01:01:36,581 --> 01:01:38,490
Oh! Ah!

686
01:01:38,582 --> 01:01:40,374
Oh!

687
01:02:20,206 --> 01:02:21,949
Their skin changes colours.

688
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,995
That's why we couldn't
see them that night.

689
01:02:27,003 --> 01:02:29,126
Tell me something, Morgan.

690
01:02:29,214 --> 01:02:31,835
Uh... in this
book of yours...

691
01:02:31,924 --> 01:02:34,001
did they happen to detail

692
01:02:34,093 --> 01:02:37,427
what would happen
if they were hostile?

693
01:02:37,513 --> 01:02:39,305
Yes.

694
01:02:39,391 --> 01:02:41,631
It said they would
probably invade.

695
01:02:41,726 --> 01:02:45,094
They would use ground
tactics... hand-to-hand combat.

696
01:02:45,187 --> 01:02:48,972
They wouldn't use our technology
or fight an airborne battle

697
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:52,481
'cause they know eventually
we would use nuclear weapons.

698
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:55,107
Then the planet would
be useless to them.

699
01:02:55,197 --> 01:02:59,325
How could anyone possibly know
that information? It's ridiculous.

700
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:00,867
What else did it say?

701
01:03:00,952 --> 01:03:04,072
They said there are one of
two outcomes of an invasion.

702
01:03:04,163 --> 01:03:07,698
One, they fight and are
defeated and have to return again

703
01:03:07,792 --> 01:03:11,706
with full forces hundreds, maybe
even thousands, of years later.

704
01:03:11,795 --> 01:03:14,880
What's two?

705
01:03:14,965 --> 01:03:18,169
They win.

706
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:22,589
I'm sorry, what...
what book is this?

707
01:03:22,681 --> 01:03:25,848
Is this really
happening?

708
01:03:29,562 --> 01:03:31,721
I heard a theory that,
uh,

709
01:03:31,815 --> 01:03:34,436
they don't like
places near water.

710
01:03:34,525 --> 01:03:38,475
Maybe we'd be safe from them
near a lake or something.

711
01:03:38,571 --> 01:03:41,323
Sounds made-up.

712
01:03:50,374 --> 01:03:53,540
I saw one of them
at Ray Reddy's house.

713
01:03:53,627 --> 01:03:55,370
I can't be sure,

714
01:03:55,461 --> 01:03:58,665
but I got the distinct feeling
he wanted to harm me.

715
01:04:00,467 --> 01:04:02,423
So...

716
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:07,671
we can choose to believe this
lake idea, pack up, and go,

717
01:04:07,766 --> 01:04:12,760
or we can stay here, hide
inside our home, wait it out.

718
01:04:12,853 --> 01:04:18,227
We might be overreacting, but
I'm willing to live with that.

719
01:04:18,316 --> 01:04:21,650
Either way, at least
we'll be together.

720
01:04:21,737 --> 01:04:26,233
All those in favour of
the lake idea, raise your hand.

721
01:04:28,743 --> 01:04:31,863
Yeah.

722
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:35,157
All those in favour of home,
raise your hand.

723
01:04:39,879 --> 01:04:41,372
Okay.

724
01:04:41,463 --> 01:04:43,337
My vote counts as two.

725
01:04:43,424 --> 01:04:45,048
That's bullshit!
You're cheating!

726
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:46,842
Morgan, calm down.

727
01:04:46,927 --> 01:04:48,753
I get two votes because
I represent two parents here.

728
01:04:48,846 --> 01:04:51,134
We don't know anything yet.

729
01:04:51,222 --> 01:04:53,429
We'll be safe here anyway.

730
01:04:53,516 --> 01:04:55,805
I don't want to leave home.

731
01:04:55,893 --> 01:04:58,848
This is where
we lived with Mom.

732
01:04:58,939 --> 01:05:01,607
That's got nothing
to do with this.

733
01:05:01,691 --> 01:05:03,933
I change my vote.

734
01:05:04,026 --> 01:05:05,437
You can't change your vote.

735
01:05:05,528 --> 01:05:09,062
All those in favour of home,
raise your hand.

736
01:05:09,156 --> 01:05:11,362
This is ridiculous.

737
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:14,201
You lose, 3-2.

738
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:34,177
We're going to board up
every window in this house.

739
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,881
How do we know boards
will do anything?

740
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:42,601
Because they seem to have
trouble with pantry doors.

741
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:48,328
The information we're receiving

742
01:06:48,416 --> 01:06:50,788
comes from our affiliates
across the world.

743
01:06:50,877 --> 01:06:54,328
Dad, Uncle Merrill!

744
01:06:57,133 --> 01:07:01,344
Amman joins Nairobi,
Beijing, and Jerusalem

745
01:07:01,429 --> 01:07:06,221
as the latest to confirm
the appearance of lights.

746
01:07:06,308 --> 01:07:09,559
There are lights
in over 274 cities.

747
01:07:09,645 --> 01:07:13,228
They think it'll be
400 within the hour.

748
01:07:13,315 --> 01:07:17,894
They're appearing at or within
one mile of crop signs.

749
01:07:17,986 --> 01:07:20,144
They were for navigation.

750
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:22,526
They made a map.

751
01:07:22,616 --> 01:07:26,613
They're gonna be
within a mile of us.

752
01:07:26,703 --> 01:07:28,494
Dad?

753
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:30,204
Yes?

754
01:07:30,289 --> 01:07:32,827
They think
these are staged

755
01:07:32,917 --> 01:07:36,617
immediately preceding
an attack manoeuvre.

756
01:07:36,712 --> 01:07:41,006
I was wrong.
They're hostile.

757
01:07:43,844 --> 01:07:46,964
It's like "War of the Worlds. "

758
01:07:47,055 --> 01:07:48,798
Ground forces
have been assembled

759
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:51,761
in countries
throughout the globe.

760
01:07:53,019 --> 01:07:54,395
Hundreds of thousands

761
01:07:54,479 --> 01:07:57,396
have flocked to temples,
synagogues, and churches.

762
01:08:03,695 --> 01:08:07,147
God be with us all.

763
01:08:19,252 --> 01:08:21,624
I'm going to get back
to the windows.

764
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:34,015
Hey, you guys okay?

765
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:38,808
Some guy had a sign saying
it was the end of the world.

766
01:08:38,895 --> 01:08:41,647
Don't worry.

767
01:08:41,732 --> 01:08:44,934
You won't let anything
happen to us, right?

768
01:08:45,027 --> 01:08:46,686
No way.

769
01:08:49,114 --> 01:08:51,355
I wish you were my dad.

770
01:08:51,449 --> 01:08:53,987
What did you say?

771
01:08:54,077 --> 01:08:57,410
Don't you ever say anything
like that again.

772
01:08:57,497 --> 01:08:59,239
Ever.

773
01:09:36,366 --> 01:09:38,490
There's too many windows
in the bedrooms.

774
01:09:38,577 --> 01:09:40,119
We don't have enough
boards.

775
01:09:40,203 --> 01:09:41,995
We'll board up
the bedroom doors.

776
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,491
Where are we
gonna sleep?

777
01:09:43,582 --> 01:09:44,862
In the family room.

778
01:09:44,958 --> 01:09:46,665
What about Isabel?

779
01:09:46,752 --> 01:09:50,036
We'll tie her up in the garage
after dinner.

780
01:09:50,129 --> 01:09:52,039
I'll make some sandwiches.

781
01:09:52,131 --> 01:09:53,922
I want spaghetti.

782
01:09:54,009 --> 01:09:56,416
We'll just eat fast, Bo.

783
01:09:56,511 --> 01:09:58,799
Spaghetti sounds great.

784
01:09:58,888 --> 01:10:01,379
What do you want, Morgan?

785
01:10:01,474 --> 01:10:04,143
Anything?

786
01:10:04,226 --> 01:10:06,717
French toast...

787
01:10:06,812 --> 01:10:09,433
and mashed potatoes.

788
01:10:09,522 --> 01:10:11,396
Now we're talking.

789
01:10:11,483 --> 01:10:13,855
How about you, Merrill?

790
01:10:16,446 --> 01:10:19,566
Chicken teriyaki.

791
01:10:19,658 --> 01:10:22,492
Good choice.

792
01:10:22,577 --> 01:10:26,360
I'm going to have
a cheeseburger with bacon.

793
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:32,786
Extra bacon.

794
01:10:56,317 --> 01:10:59,520
What's the matter
with everyone? Eat.

795
01:10:59,612 --> 01:11:01,604
Maybe we should say
a prayer.

796
01:11:01,696 --> 01:11:02,645
No.

797
01:11:02,739 --> 01:11:03,854
Why not?

798
01:11:03,949 --> 01:11:06,025
We're not saying a prayer.

799
01:11:06,118 --> 01:11:07,825
Bo has a bad feeling.

800
01:11:07,911 --> 01:11:09,287
I had a dream.

801
01:11:09,371 --> 01:11:12,158
We aren't saying a prayer.

802
01:11:12,248 --> 01:11:13,742
Eat!

803
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:15,078
I hate you.

804
01:11:16,669 --> 01:11:18,294
That's fine.

805
01:11:18,379 --> 01:11:19,837
You let Mom die.

806
01:11:19,922 --> 01:11:21,547
Morgan.

807
01:11:24,676 --> 01:11:28,461
I am not wasting one more minute
of my life on prayer.

808
01:11:28,556 --> 01:11:31,047
Not one more minute.

809
01:11:31,142 --> 01:11:32,470
Understood?

810
01:11:34,102 --> 01:11:36,060
Now we are going
to enjoy this meal.

811
01:11:36,146 --> 01:11:38,981
No one can stop us from enjoying
this meal, so enjoy it!

812
01:11:39,065 --> 01:11:41,105
...Stop crying!

813
01:11:41,192 --> 01:11:43,434
...Graham...
... Don't yell at her!

814
01:11:45,196 --> 01:11:47,354
Alright, since you're
all not gonna eat.

815
01:11:47,448 --> 01:11:49,690
I'm gonna try
some of everything.

816
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:05,476
It's happening.

817
01:13:35,383 --> 01:13:37,589
Graham, hurry.

818
01:14:01,908 --> 01:14:04,316
Did I ever tell you
what everyone said

819
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:06,284
when you were born, Bo?

820
01:14:10,041 --> 01:14:13,208
You came out of your mama,
and you didn't even cry.

821
01:14:13,294 --> 01:14:14,919
You just opened your eyes,

822
01:14:15,004 --> 01:14:17,791
and you looked around
the room at everybody.

823
01:14:17,881 --> 01:14:21,085
Your eyes
were so big and gorgeous.

824
01:14:21,176 --> 01:14:24,213
All the ladies in the room
just gasped.

825
01:14:24,305 --> 01:14:26,760
I mean,
they literally gasped.

826
01:14:26,849 --> 01:14:30,632
And they go,
"Oh, she's like an angel. "

827
01:14:30,727 --> 01:14:35,140
And they said, "We've never
seen a baby so beautiful. "

828
01:14:35,232 --> 01:14:38,648
And then... you know
what happened?

829
01:14:38,735 --> 01:14:42,779
They put you on the table
to clean you up,

830
01:14:42,864 --> 01:14:46,731
and you looked up at me
and you smiled.

831
01:14:48,953 --> 01:14:52,866
They say babies that young
can't smile.

832
01:14:52,956 --> 01:14:55,032
You smiled.

833
01:14:57,127 --> 01:14:59,618
Let's go down now.

834
01:15:18,939 --> 01:15:23,186
We forgot Isabel.

835
01:16:01,896 --> 01:16:05,146
Should we turn off
the lights?

836
01:16:05,233 --> 01:16:08,400
They already know
we're here.

837
01:17:02,536 --> 01:17:05,372
Dad...

838
01:17:15,799 --> 01:17:19,049
Do you know what happened
when you were born, Morgan?

839
01:17:19,136 --> 01:17:21,805
You came out, and your mama
kept bleeding,

840
01:17:21,888 --> 01:17:24,461
so the doctors rushed you
out of the room

841
01:17:24,558 --> 01:17:26,799
before I even had time
to see you.

842
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:30,846
They're on the roof.

843
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:32,895
While they
were fixing her up,

844
01:17:32,983 --> 01:17:35,140
all she kept asking about
was you.

845
01:17:36,819 --> 01:17:38,693
They're in the house.

846
01:17:38,779 --> 01:17:41,982
I wanted your mama
to see you first

847
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:46,237
because she had dreamt
about you her whole life.

848
01:17:46,329 --> 01:17:49,245
Then she got feeling better,
they brought you in,

849
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,371
and they placed you
in her arms,

850
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:55,076
and she looked at you,
and you looked at her,

851
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:59,463
and you just stared at each
other for the longest time.

852
01:17:59,548 --> 01:18:01,707
And then she said real soft,

853
01:18:01,801 --> 01:18:06,628
"Hello, Morgan.
I'm your mama.

854
01:18:06,722 --> 01:18:09,260
You look
just how I dreamt. "

855
01:18:28,659 --> 01:18:31,151
The attic door.

856
01:18:33,706 --> 01:18:34,904
Let's go.

857
01:18:34,999 --> 01:18:36,197
Come on.

858
01:18:50,556 --> 01:18:53,307
We forgot
our foil helmets.

859
01:18:53,391 --> 01:18:55,633
Have we got anything to wedge
against the door knob?

860
01:18:55,727 --> 01:18:56,842
They'll read our minds.

861
01:18:56,936 --> 01:18:58,099
You're scaring
your sister.

862
01:18:58,188 --> 01:19:00,264
I'm already scared.

863
01:19:03,526 --> 01:19:05,068
Merrill.

864
01:19:05,153 --> 01:19:06,481
I'm looking!

865
01:19:06,571 --> 01:19:07,733
They'll know
our secret thoughts.

866
01:19:23,044 --> 01:19:26,460
I'm not ready.

867
01:19:26,547 --> 01:19:27,922
Merrill!

868
01:19:28,008 --> 01:19:29,466
Got it!

869
01:19:29,551 --> 01:19:32,551
...Dad!

870
01:20:02,498 --> 01:20:05,618
Where's Bo?

871
01:20:13,383 --> 01:20:16,004
I'm okay.

872
01:20:46,039 --> 01:20:48,162
What's happening out there?

873
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:50,871
I can't even imagine.

874
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:54,246
I hope they're doing better
than we are.

875
01:20:54,339 --> 01:20:57,292
We don't even have helmets.

876
01:21:10,895 --> 01:21:15,474
They're only making noises.
They're not trying to get in.

877
01:21:15,567 --> 01:21:17,476
Why would they do that?

878
01:21:17,569 --> 01:21:20,142
They want our attention
on the door?

879
01:21:22,448 --> 01:21:23,528
They're distracting us.

880
01:21:23,616 --> 01:21:25,110
From what?

881
01:21:25,201 --> 01:21:27,953
The book says they're probably
very good problem solvers.

882
01:21:28,037 --> 01:21:31,452
They'll find a way in.

883
01:21:35,085 --> 01:21:37,243
Morgan,
give me your flashlight.

884
01:21:43,927 --> 01:21:47,260
They used to pour coal
down in this basement.

885
01:21:47,347 --> 01:21:49,671
There's a coal chute
in here.

886
01:22:03,112 --> 01:22:05,781
I can feel air.

887
01:22:05,864 --> 01:22:07,773
Me too!

888
01:22:07,867 --> 01:22:09,526
It's getting stronger.

889
01:22:09,618 --> 01:22:11,076
I'm close.

890
01:22:23,255 --> 01:22:24,500
What?

891
01:22:25,966 --> 01:22:27,211
Hold him!

892
01:22:27,302 --> 01:22:28,582
I got him!

893
01:22:28,678 --> 01:22:29,923
Hold him!

894
01:22:30,012 --> 01:22:31,293
I got him!

895
01:22:31,388 --> 01:22:32,633
Hold him!

896
01:23:30,361 --> 01:23:32,733
We don't have
his medicine.

897
01:23:38,035 --> 01:23:39,861
Don't be afraid, Morgan.

898
01:23:39,953 --> 01:23:42,444
We'll slow this down
together.

899
01:23:42,539 --> 01:23:44,081
Feel my chest.

900
01:23:44,165 --> 01:23:47,035
Feel it moving
in and out.

901
01:23:47,126 --> 01:23:50,627
Breathe like me.

902
01:23:50,713 --> 01:23:52,421
Come on.

903
01:23:52,507 --> 01:23:54,879
I dreamt this.

904
01:23:54,967 --> 01:23:56,295
Stay with me.

905
01:23:56,385 --> 01:23:59,505
I know it hurts.
Be strong, baby.

906
01:23:59,597 --> 01:24:05,802
It'll pass.

907
01:24:21,159 --> 01:24:24,990
Don't do this to me
again.

908
01:24:25,079 --> 01:24:27,118
Not again.

909
01:24:31,251 --> 01:24:37,247
I hate you.

910
01:24:40,969 --> 01:24:43,009
The fear is feeding him.

911
01:24:43,096 --> 01:24:46,381
Don't be afraid
of what's happening.

912
01:24:46,473 --> 01:24:49,973
Believe it's going to pass.
Believe it.

913
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:54,224
Just wait.
Don't be afraid.

914
01:24:54,315 --> 01:24:58,478
The air is coming.
Believe.

915
01:24:58,568 --> 01:25:00,691
We don't have to be afraid.

916
01:25:00,779 --> 01:25:03,317
It's about to pass.

917
01:25:03,406 --> 01:25:07,700
Here it comes.
Don't be afraid.

918
01:25:07,786 --> 01:25:10,822
Here comes the air.

919
01:25:19,297 --> 01:25:21,669
Don't be afraid, Morgan.

920
01:25:21,758 --> 01:25:25,090
Feel my chest.
Breathe with me.

921
01:25:25,177 --> 01:25:29,257
Together. The air
is going in our lungs.

922
01:25:29,348 --> 01:25:31,886
Together.

923
01:25:31,975 --> 01:25:37,727
We're the same.

924
01:25:48,408 --> 01:25:52,156
We should save
the flashlights.

925
01:26:04,839 --> 01:26:07,710
Ray's truck
swerved off the road

926
01:26:07,801 --> 01:26:11,216
and hit Colleen
and then a tree,

927
01:26:11,304 --> 01:26:14,969
and she was pinned
between the two.

928
01:26:15,058 --> 01:26:18,260
What does that mean...
pinned?

929
01:26:18,352 --> 01:26:19,727
The truck...

930
01:26:19,812 --> 01:26:23,513
the truck has severed
most of her lower half.

931
01:26:23,607 --> 01:26:25,066
What did you say?

932
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:28,317
She won't be saved.

933
01:26:28,404 --> 01:26:31,653
Her body is pinned
in such a way

934
01:26:31,739 --> 01:26:35,868
that it's alive when it
shouldn't be alive,

935
01:26:35,952 --> 01:26:39,700
and the truck is
holding her together.

936
01:26:39,789 --> 01:26:41,164
And she doesn't feel much,

937
01:26:41,249 --> 01:26:43,739
and she's... she's talking
almost like normal,

938
01:26:43,834 --> 01:26:45,661
and we didn't
pull the truck out

939
01:26:45,753 --> 01:26:48,161
'cause we... we wanted you
to come down here

940
01:26:48,255 --> 01:26:52,585
and be with her
as long as she's awake.

941
01:26:52,677 --> 01:26:56,295
And that won't be very long.

942
01:26:56,388 --> 01:27:00,765
Now, Father, do you understand
what I've told you?

943
01:27:02,894 --> 01:27:05,812
Caroline...

944
01:27:05,897 --> 01:27:08,814
is this the last time I'm
gonna talk with my wife?

945
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:12,233
Yes, it is.

946
01:27:35,258 --> 01:27:37,298
People think they came here
to take over the planet.

947
01:27:37,385 --> 01:27:40,884
That's bull.
I don't think that.

948
01:27:40,972 --> 01:27:43,463
My friend and I saw them.

949
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:46,179
...I found a pack
of light bulbs.

950
01:27:46,268 --> 01:27:49,055
They poisoned his family.
They dragged them away.

951
01:27:51,606 --> 01:27:53,813
Nobody believes it, but they
didn't come here for our planet.

952
01:27:53,900 --> 01:27:55,311
This is a raid.

953
01:27:55,401 --> 01:27:58,568
They came here for us,
to harvest us.

954
01:28:02,075 --> 01:28:05,325
We're lucky as hell
they're leaving here.

955
01:28:05,412 --> 01:28:07,238
They're leaving?

956
01:28:07,330 --> 01:28:09,618
That's what they're saying.

957
01:28:11,709 --> 01:28:13,832
How long
have we been sleeping?

958
01:28:13,920 --> 01:28:15,295
12 hours or so.

959
01:28:17,047 --> 01:28:21,259
He said
they had poison gas...

960
01:28:21,343 --> 01:28:25,554
they secrete
in small amounts.

961
01:28:25,638 --> 01:28:28,426
A lot of people died.

962
01:28:28,517 --> 01:28:29,975
But they're leaving.

963
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:31,851
They left real fast
this morning,

964
01:28:31,937 --> 01:28:33,929
like something
scared them off.

965
01:28:34,021 --> 01:28:36,512
They left some
of their wounded behind.

966
01:28:40,445 --> 01:28:42,022
Why are they going?

967
01:28:42,113 --> 01:28:46,062
People must have figured out
a way to beat them.

968
01:28:46,158 --> 01:28:49,029
Everyone has a weakness,
right?

969
01:28:55,834 --> 01:28:59,452
You didn't think we'd make it
through the night, did you?

970
01:29:01,423 --> 01:29:02,881
No.

971
01:29:05,844 --> 01:29:07,800
Listen...

972
01:29:07,887 --> 01:29:12,513
there's things I can take
and a couple things I can't.

973
01:29:12,599 --> 01:29:16,811
One of them I can't take
is when my older brother,

974
01:29:16,896 --> 01:29:19,813
who's everything
I want to be...

975
01:29:19,898 --> 01:29:22,769
starts losing faith
in things.

976
01:29:24,903 --> 01:29:27,026
I saw your eyes last night.

977
01:29:27,113 --> 01:29:31,194
I don't want to ever see
your eyes like that again.

978
01:29:31,284 --> 01:29:35,577
Okay?
I'm serious.

979
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:41,291
Okay.

980
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:49,467
He's been like that
for a while.

981
01:29:49,551 --> 01:29:53,549
He needs his medicine.

982
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:56,556
Have they said anything
about our area?

983
01:29:56,642 --> 01:30:00,425
Philadelphia and its outlying
counties are cleared...

984
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,189
but who knows for sure?

985
01:30:03,272 --> 01:30:05,514
He's not strong enough.

986
01:30:05,608 --> 01:30:07,766
If he has another attack
right now...

987
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:10,861
I know.

988
01:30:10,946 --> 01:30:15,158
We'd have to be sure before
we opened up that door, Graham.

989
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:40,717
It's good enough for me.

990
01:30:40,808 --> 01:30:41,757
Me too.

991
01:31:48,372 --> 01:31:49,913
Get the syringes' well.

992
01:31:49,998 --> 01:31:53,118
We may need to give him
an epinephrine shot.

993
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:18,683
The atmosphere here is
cautiously optimistic.

994
01:32:18,775 --> 01:32:21,348
...They're doing this on TV.
... People are celebrating.

995
01:32:21,444 --> 01:32:23,271
There's a great sense
of relief.

996
01:32:23,363 --> 01:32:25,272
...They're dancing.
... Yeah, like this.

997
01:32:25,364 --> 01:32:27,736
As we begin evaluating
the loss of life,

998
01:32:27,825 --> 01:32:31,324
...Do you want to see it?... we
will be left with a lot of questions.

999
01:32:31,412 --> 01:32:35,280
...I'll bring the TV in here.... I
see the same expression on every face.

1000
01:32:35,374 --> 01:32:38,126
We know the battle turned
around in the Middle East.

1001
01:32:38,210 --> 01:32:41,828
Three small cities there found a
primitive method to defeat them.

1002
01:32:41,922 --> 01:32:44,128
We have no further details
at this time.

1003
01:34:17,262 --> 01:34:21,924
Hi, sweetie.

1004
01:34:22,017 --> 01:34:24,305
Hi, baby.

1005
01:34:24,394 --> 01:34:30,348
I was... just taking a walk
before dinner.

1006
01:34:30,441 --> 01:34:33,146
You love walks.

1007
01:34:33,235 --> 01:34:36,485
It was meant to be.

1008
01:34:36,572 --> 01:34:38,979
Does it hurt?

1009
01:34:39,074 --> 01:34:41,066
I don't feel much.

1010
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:43,068
Good.

1011
01:34:50,251 --> 01:34:52,410
Tell Morgan...

1012
01:34:52,503 --> 01:34:54,081
to play games.

1013
01:34:54,171 --> 01:34:55,998
It's okay to be silly.

1014
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:58,083
I will.

1015
01:34:58,176 --> 01:35:01,211
Tell Bo to listen
to her brother.

1016
01:35:01,303 --> 01:35:04,090
He'll always take care
of her.

1017
01:35:04,181 --> 01:35:05,212
I will.

1018
01:35:05,307 --> 01:35:07,430
And tell Graham...

1019
01:35:07,517 --> 01:35:09,593
I'm here.

1020
01:35:09,686 --> 01:35:11,975
Tell him...

1021
01:35:12,063 --> 01:35:14,140
see.

1022
01:35:14,232 --> 01:35:17,102
Tell him to see.

1023
01:35:20,821 --> 01:35:23,858
And tell Merrill
to swing away.

1024
01:35:28,413 --> 01:35:32,706
See, what you have to ask yourself
is, what kind of person are you?

1025
01:35:32,791 --> 01:35:36,623
Are you the kind that sees
signs, sees miracles?

1026
01:35:36,711 --> 01:35:41,456
Or do you believe that
people just get lucky?

1027
01:35:41,549 --> 01:35:48,512
Is it possible...
there are no coincidences?

1028
01:36:14,581 --> 01:36:17,154
Swing away, Merrill.

1029
01:36:19,252 --> 01:36:21,209
Merrill...

1030
01:36:21,295 --> 01:36:23,454
swing away.

1031
01:38:19,699 --> 01:38:23,861
That's why he had asthma.

1032
01:38:28,290 --> 01:38:29,700
It can't be luck.

1033
01:38:29,791 --> 01:38:32,994
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.

1034
01:38:33,086 --> 01:38:35,755
No poison got in.
No poison got in.

1035
01:38:35,838 --> 01:38:39,172
His lungs were closed.
His lungs were closed.

1036
01:38:39,258 --> 01:38:42,010
Don't touch him.
Give him a minute.

1037
01:38:44,221 --> 01:38:46,428
Graham...

1038
01:38:46,515 --> 01:38:48,887
Give him a second.

1039
01:38:48,976 --> 01:38:50,351
D- Daddy...

1040
01:38:50,435 --> 01:38:51,895
Don't touch him.

1041
01:38:55,065 --> 01:38:56,726
Graham...

1042
01:38:59,653 --> 01:39:04,315
Don't... don't.

1043
01:39:04,407 --> 01:39:07,443
Dad?

1044
01:39:07,536 --> 01:39:09,362
What happened?

1045
01:39:19,046 --> 01:39:22,213
Did someone save me?

1046
01:39:23,884 --> 01:39:27,218
Yeah, baby,
I think someone did.
