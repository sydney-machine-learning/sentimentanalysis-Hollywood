1
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,211
<i>- You cannot pass!
- Gandalf!</i>

2
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:25,997
<i>I am a servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.</i>

3
00:01:33,622 --> 00:01:36,339
<i>Go back to the Shadow.</i>

4
00:01:37,046 --> 00:01:40,722
<i>The dark fire will not avail you,
flame of Udûn!</i>

5
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:48,844
You shall not pass!

6
00:02:14,866 --> 00:02:16,360
No! No!

7
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:18,566
Gandalf!

8
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,468
Fly, you fools.

9
00:02:28,145 --> 00:02:29,803
No!

10
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:33,637
Gandalf!

11
00:03:39,562 --> 00:03:41,350
Gandalf!

12
00:03:42,313 --> 00:03:44,419
What is it, Mr. Frodo?

13
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:48,004
Nothing.

14
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,894
Just a dream.

15
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,786
Can you see the bottom?

16
00:04:11,975 --> 00:04:14,941
No! Don't look down, Sam!
Just keep going!

17
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,389
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!

18
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:32,227
Mr. Frodo!

19
00:04:34,788 --> 00:04:36,348
I think I've found the bottom.

20
00:04:41,636 --> 00:04:44,505
Bogs and rope,
and goodness knows what.

21
00:04:44,643 --> 00:04:47,708
It's not natural. None of it.

22
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:52,633
- What's in this?
- Nothing.

23
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:55,065
Just a bit of seasoning.

24
00:04:55,522 --> 00:04:58,239
I thought maybe if we was having
a roast chicken one night or something.

25
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,922
Roast chicken?!

26
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:02,747
You never know.

27
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,951
Sam. My dear Sam.

28
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,424
It's very special, that.
It's the best salt in all the Shire.

29
00:05:12,608 --> 00:05:14,517
It is special.

30
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:20,093
It's a little bit of home.

31
00:05:23,231 --> 00:05:25,653
We can't leave this here for someone
to follow us down.

32
00:05:26,015 --> 00:05:29,462
Who's gonna follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?

33
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:33,815
It's a shame, really.
Lady Galadriel gave me that.

34
00:05:34,558 --> 00:05:36,412
Real Elvish rope.

35
00:05:37,277 --> 00:05:39,515
Well, there's nothing for it.
It's one of my knots.

36
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:41,565
Won't come free in a hurry.

37
00:05:50,076 --> 00:05:52,280
Real Elvish rope.

38
00:06:05,818 --> 00:06:10,041
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don't want to see any closer.

39
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:12,243
And it's the one place
we're trying to get to.

40
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,742
It's just where we can't get.

41
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,904
Let's face it, Mr. Frodo, we're lost.

42
00:06:21,273 --> 00:06:23,956
I don't think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.

43
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:28,531
He didn't mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam...

44
00:06:29,368 --> 00:06:30,863
...but they did.

45
00:06:43,447 --> 00:06:44,308
Mr. Frodo?

46
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:49,395
It's the Ring, isn't it?

47
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:52,875
It's getting heavier.

48
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:07,567
- What food have we got left?
- Let me see.

49
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:10,283
Oh, yes. Lovely.

50
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:13,105
Lembas bread. And look!

51
00:07:15,379 --> 00:07:17,681
More lembas bread.

52
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:29,778
I don't usually hold with foreign food...

53
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:32,785
...but this Elvish stuff, it's not bad.

54
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:37,065
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?

55
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:44,812
Those rain clouds might.

56
00:08:17,678 --> 00:08:20,360
This looks strangely familiar.

57
00:08:20,973 --> 00:08:23,307
It's because we've been here before.

58
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:25,991
We're going in circles.

59
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:28,391
What is that horrid stink?

60
00:08:28,684 --> 00:08:30,757
I warrant there's a nasty bog nearby.

61
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:32,780
- Can you smell it?
- Yes.

62
00:08:34,732 --> 00:08:36,805
I can smell it.

63
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,273
We're not alone.

64
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:59,362
The thieves. The thieves.

65
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:03,294
The filthy little thieves.

66
00:09:03,849 --> 00:09:06,052
Where is it?

67
00:09:06,216 --> 00:09:08,671
Where is it?

68
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:12,451
They stole it from us.

69
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:16,738
My precious.

70
00:09:17,608 --> 00:09:20,673
Curse them, we hates them!

71
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,734
It's ours, it is, and we wants it!

72
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,326
This is Sting.

73
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,018
You've seen it before...

74
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:23,487
...haven't you, Gollum?

75
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,775
Release him or I'll cut your throat.

76
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:47,899
It burns!

77
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:50,169
It burns us!

78
00:10:51,678 --> 00:10:53,020
It freezes!

79
00:10:54,783 --> 00:10:56,888
Nasty Elves twisted it.

80
00:10:57,055 --> 00:10:59,640
- Take it off us!
- Quiet, you!

81
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:07,062
It's hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor's
going to hear this racket.

82
00:11:07,228 --> 00:11:09,749
- Let's just tie him up and leave him.
- No!

83
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:13,277
That would kill us! Kill us!

84
00:11:13,405 --> 00:11:16,022
It's no more than you deserve!

85
00:11:17,692 --> 00:11:19,666
Maybe he does deserve to die.

86
00:11:21,884 --> 00:11:25,298
But now that I see him, I do pity him.

87
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:33,175
We be nice to them
if they be nice to us.

88
00:11:33,371 --> 00:11:36,054
Take it off us.

89
00:11:39,034 --> 00:11:42,831
We swears to do what you wants.

90
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,824
We swears.

91
00:11:45,242 --> 00:11:47,510
There's no promise you can make
that I can trust.

92
00:11:50,105 --> 00:11:51,665
We swears...

93
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:56,465
...to serve the master
of the precious.

94
00:11:58,104 --> 00:12:00,275
We will swear on...

95
00:12:00,568 --> 00:12:02,290
...on the precious.

96
00:12:02,615 --> 00:12:04,688
Gollum. Gollum.

97
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:08,751
The Ring is treacherous.
It will hold you to your word.

98
00:12:09,591 --> 00:12:10,801
Yes...

99
00:12:11,447 --> 00:12:13,749
...on the precious.

100
00:12:16,118 --> 00:12:18,388
On the precious.

101
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,004
I don't believe you!

102
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:26,195
- Get down! I said, down!
- Sam!

103
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:28,044
He's trying to trick us.

104
00:12:28,182 --> 00:12:31,214
If we let him go, he'll throttle us
in our sleep.

105
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:46,377
- You know the way to Mordor?
- Yes.

106
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:50,926
You've been there before?

107
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:53,483
Yes.

108
00:13:03,954 --> 00:13:06,342
You will lead us to the Black Gate.

109
00:13:14,673 --> 00:13:18,415
To the Gate, to the Gate!
To the Gate, the master says. Yes!

110
00:13:18,544 --> 00:13:23,181
No! We won't go back.
Not there. Not to him.

111
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:27,338
They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!

112
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:30,853
But we swore to serve the master
of the precious.

113
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:36,739
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is,
and pits, pits, pits.

114
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:39,659
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.

115
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:44,710
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.

116
00:13:47,566 --> 00:13:51,242
Hey! Come back now! Come back!

117
00:13:53,484 --> 00:13:55,753
There! What did I tell you?

118
00:13:55,884 --> 00:13:57,989
He's run off, the old villain.

119
00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,612
So much for his promises.

120
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,373
This way, Hobbits.

121
00:14:02,572 --> 00:14:04,514
Follow me!

122
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:19,110
Merry!

123
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:21,536
Merry!

124
00:14:26,761 --> 00:14:30,406
You're late.
Our master grows impatient.

125
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:32,326
He wants the Shire-rats now.

126
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:37,470
I don't take orders from Orc-maggots.

127
00:14:38,472 --> 00:14:41,406
Saruman will have his prize.

128
00:14:41,704 --> 00:14:44,737
We will deliver them.

129
00:14:50,664 --> 00:14:51,907
Merry!

130
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:54,401
Merry? Wake up.

131
00:14:57,671 --> 00:14:59,459
My friend is sick.

132
00:14:59,974 --> 00:15:02,429
He needs water. Please!

133
00:15:03,173 --> 00:15:06,970
Sick, is he?
Give him some medicine, boys!

134
00:15:10,053 --> 00:15:11,678
Stop it!

135
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:16,350
Can't take his draught!

136
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,340
- Leave him alone!
- Why?

137
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:24,161
You want some?

138
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,064
Then keep your mouth shut.

139
00:15:31,267 --> 00:15:33,209
Merry.

140
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:35,609
Hello, Pip.

141
00:15:37,378 --> 00:15:39,647
- You're hurt.
- I'm fine.

142
00:15:39,777 --> 00:15:42,265
- It was just an act.
- An act?

143
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,567
See? I fooled you too.

144
00:15:48,225 --> 00:15:49,915
Don't worry about me, Pippin.

145
00:15:52,097 --> 00:15:54,006
What is it? What do you smell?

146
00:15:54,943 --> 00:15:56,122
Man-flesh.

147
00:15:58,176 --> 00:16:00,543
They've picked up our trail.

148
00:16:01,601 --> 00:16:02,648
Aragorn.

149
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:06,107
Let's move!

150
00:16:28,606 --> 00:16:31,093
Their pace has quickened.

151
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:33,980
They must have caught our scent.

152
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:35,831
Hurry!

153
00:16:39,228 --> 00:16:40,951
Come on, Gimli!

154
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,807
Three days and nights pursuit.

155
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,786
No food. No rest.

156
00:16:49,947 --> 00:16:53,744
And no sign of our quarry,
but what bare rock can tell.

157
00:17:23,992 --> 00:17:26,991
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.

158
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:30,614
They may yet be alive.

159
00:17:31,447 --> 00:17:33,868
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.

160
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:38,740
Come, Gimli! We're gaining on them!

161
00:17:39,062 --> 00:17:43,120
I'm wasted on cross-country.
We Dwarves are natural sprinters.

162
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:46,771
Very dangerous over short distances.

163
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,631
Rohan.

164
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:02,513
Home of the Horse-lords.

165
00:18:03,636 --> 00:18:06,156
There's something strange at work here.

166
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:09,138
Some evil gives speed
to these creatures.

167
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,146
Sets its will against us.

168
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:19,857
Legolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?

169
00:18:19,986 --> 00:18:22,505
The Uruks turn northeast.

170
00:18:23,346 --> 00:18:25,385
They are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.

171
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:27,401
Saruman.

172
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,633
<i>The world is changing.</i>

173
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:44,038
<i>Who now has the strength to stand
against the armies of Isengard...</i>

174
00:18:44,752 --> 00:18:47,435
<i>...and Mordor?</i>

175
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:54,405
<i>To stand against the might of Sauron
and Saruman...</i>

176
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:58,087
<i>...and the union of the two towers?</i>

177
00:19:04,397 --> 00:19:07,267
<i>Together, my Lord Sauron...</i>

178
00:19:07,406 --> 00:19:10,701
<i>...we shall rule this Middle-earth.</i>

179
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:30,313
<i>The Old World will burn
in the fires of industry.</i>

180
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:33,861
<i>The forests will fall.</i>

181
00:19:35,722 --> 00:19:38,472
<i>A new order will rise.</i>

182
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:44,233
<i>We will drive the machine of war
with the sword and the spear...</i>

183
00:19:44,361 --> 00:19:48,158
<i>...and the iron fists of the Orc.</i>

184
00:20:00,231 --> 00:20:03,298
I want them armed and ready to march
within two weeks!

185
00:20:03,432 --> 00:20:05,057
But, my lord, there are too many!

186
00:20:05,191 --> 00:20:08,093
They cannot all be armed in time,
we don't have the means.

187
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:11,166
Build a dam, block the stream,
work the furnaces night and day.

188
00:20:11,847 --> 00:20:14,050
We don't have enough fuel
to feed the fires.

189
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:19,522
The Forest of Fangorn
lies on our doorstep.

190
00:20:20,806 --> 00:20:23,172
- Burn it.
- Yes.

191
00:20:23,751 --> 00:20:26,051
We will fight for you.

192
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:28,091
Swear it.

193
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:42,721
We will die for Saruman.

194
00:20:43,748 --> 00:20:45,658
The Horse-Men took your lands.

195
00:20:45,796 --> 00:20:50,235
They drove your people into the hills
to scratch a living off rocks.

196
00:20:50,371 --> 00:20:51,833
Murderers!

197
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:54,751
Take back the lands they stole from you.

198
00:20:54,882 --> 00:20:56,638
Burn every village!

199
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:04,570
<i>We have only to remove those
who oppose us.</i>

200
00:21:04,962 --> 00:21:07,449
<i>It will begin in Rohan.</i>

201
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,520
<i>Too long have these peasants
stood against you.</i>

202
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:13,405
<i>But no more.</i>

203
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:15,838
Éothain! Éothain!

204
00:21:17,889 --> 00:21:20,344
You take your sister.
You'll go faster with just two.

205
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,254
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.

206
00:21:23,552 --> 00:21:25,046
He is too big for him.

207
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:28,053
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm.

208
00:21:28,351 --> 00:21:30,685
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, Mama.

209
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:33,726
I don't want to leave.
I don't want to go, Mama.

210
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:37,462
Freda, I will find you there.

211
00:21:42,206 --> 00:21:43,897
Quickly!

212
00:21:49,982 --> 00:21:51,541
Go, child.

213
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,755
<i>Rohan, my lord...</i>

214
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:08,758
<i>...is ready to fall.</i>

215
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,074
Théodred.

216
00:22:21,242 --> 00:22:22,703
Find the king's son!

217
00:22:38,552 --> 00:22:44,334
- Mordor will pay for this.
- These Orcs are not from Mordor.

218
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:47,990
My Lord Éomer, over here!

219
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,067
He's alive.

220
00:23:27,635 --> 00:23:29,610
Théodred.

221
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,448
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

222
00:23:45,777 --> 00:23:48,080
He was ambushed by Orcs.

223
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,195
If we don't defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.

224
00:23:53,489 --> 00:23:55,943
That is a lie.

225
00:23:58,065 --> 00:24:02,670
Saruman the White has ever been
our friend and ally.

226
00:24:04,144 --> 00:24:06,085
Grima.

227
00:24:07,536 --> 00:24:09,423
Grima.

228
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,286
Grima.

229
00:24:13,934 --> 00:24:17,000
Orcs are roaming freely
across our lands.

230
00:24:17,326 --> 00:24:20,840
Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will.

231
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:24,205
Orcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.

232
00:24:31,757 --> 00:24:37,321
Why do you lay these troubles
on an already troubled mind?

233
00:24:37,453 --> 00:24:39,754
Can you not see?

234
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:44,900
Your uncle is wearied
by your malcontent...

235
00:24:45,036 --> 00:24:47,369
...your warmongering.

236
00:24:49,452 --> 00:24:51,360
Warmongering?

237
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,699
How long is it since
Saruman bought you?

238
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,742
What was the promised price, Grima?

239
00:24:56,938 --> 00:25:00,451
When all the Men are dead,
you will take your share of the treasure?

240
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,914
Too long have you watched my sister.

241
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,990
Too long have you haunted her steps.

242
00:25:24,712 --> 00:25:28,967
You see much, Éomer, son of Éomund.

243
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:30,176
Too much.

244
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:37,028
You are banished forthwith
from the kingdom of Rohan...

245
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:41,795
...and all its domains
under pain of death.

246
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,517
You have no authority here.

247
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:46,947
Your orders mean nothing.

248
00:25:47,525 --> 00:25:51,235
This order does not come from me.

249
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:53,406
It comes from the king.

250
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:56,442
He signed it this morning.

251
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:29,436
Keep breathing. That's the key.

252
00:26:29,632 --> 00:26:31,291
Breathe.

253
00:26:35,234 --> 00:26:38,942
They've run as if the very whips
of their masters were behind them.

254
00:26:54,367 --> 00:26:56,309
We're not going no further...

255
00:26:56,447 --> 00:26:58,357
...until we've had a breather.

256
00:26:58,815 --> 00:27:00,701
Get a fire going!

257
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:06,166
Merry!

258
00:27:06,462 --> 00:27:07,837
Merry!

259
00:27:09,374 --> 00:27:14,490
I think we might have made a mistake
leaving the Shire, Pippin.

260
00:27:23,485 --> 00:27:25,557
What's making that noise?

261
00:27:27,164 --> 00:27:28,473
It's the trees.

262
00:27:29,243 --> 00:27:30,226
What?

263
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:34,199
You remember the Old Forest,
on the borders of Buckland?

264
00:27:34,363 --> 00:27:38,737
Folk used to say there was something in
the water that made the trees grow tall...

265
00:27:38,906 --> 00:27:40,433
...and come alive.

266
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:42,292
Alive?

267
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:44,660
Trees that could whisper...

268
00:27:45,658 --> 00:27:48,079
...talk to each other...

269
00:27:48,217 --> 00:27:49,974
...even move.

270
00:27:51,418 --> 00:27:53,687
I'm starving.

271
00:27:53,818 --> 00:27:57,712
We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread
for three stinking days.

272
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,186
Yeah!

273
00:27:59,512 --> 00:28:02,611
Why can't we have some meat?!

274
00:28:04,824 --> 00:28:06,896
What about them?

275
00:28:07,192 --> 00:28:09,046
They're fresh.

276
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,204
They are not for eating.

277
00:28:18,966 --> 00:28:20,853
What about their legs?

278
00:28:20,983 --> 00:28:23,186
They don't need those.

279
00:28:24,662 --> 00:28:27,662
- They look tasty.
- Get back, scum!

280
00:28:29,461 --> 00:28:34,163
The prisoners go to Saruman.
Alive and unspoiled.

281
00:28:34,452 --> 00:28:36,341
Alive?

282
00:28:39,188 --> 00:28:43,246
Why alive?
Do they give good sport?

283
00:28:45,652 --> 00:28:48,815
They have something.
An Elvish weapon.

284
00:28:48,948 --> 00:28:51,850
The master wants it for the war.

285
00:28:54,643 --> 00:28:56,465
They think we have the Ring.

286
00:28:56,595 --> 00:28:59,017
As soon as they find out we don't,
we're dead.

287
00:29:00,658 --> 00:29:02,568
Just a mouthful...

288
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:03,978
...a bit of the flank.

289
00:29:10,545 --> 00:29:13,861
Looks like meat's back on the menu,
boys.

290
00:29:20,272 --> 00:29:21,451
Pippin.

291
00:29:21,585 --> 00:29:23,275
Let's go.

292
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,806
Go on.

293
00:29:32,974 --> 00:29:34,468
Call for help.

294
00:29:35,728 --> 00:29:36,775
Squeal.

295
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:39,943
No one's going to save you now.

296
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:50,154
Pippin!

297
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,874
A red sun rises.

298
00:30:16,298 --> 00:30:19,113
Blood has been spilled this night.

299
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:50,789
Riders of Rohan...

300
00:30:51,304 --> 00:30:53,572
...what news from the Mark?

301
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:24,385
What business does an Elf, a Man
and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?

302
00:31:25,188 --> 00:31:26,333
Speak quickly!

303
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:31,163
Give me your name, horse-master,
and I shall give you mine.

304
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:42,363
I would cut off your head, Dwarf...

305
00:31:42,722 --> 00:31:45,111
...if it stood but a little higher
from the ground.

306
00:31:46,082 --> 00:31:48,056
You would die before your stroke fell.

307
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:58,303
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

308
00:31:58,593 --> 00:32:02,585
This is Gimli, son of Glóin,
and Legolas of the Woodland Realm.

309
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:05,948
We are friends of Rohan
and of Théoden, your king.

310
00:32:07,488 --> 00:32:11,132
Théoden no longer recognizes
friend from foe.

311
00:32:11,327 --> 00:32:13,368
Not even his own kin.

312
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:19,678
Saruman has poisoned the mind
of the king...

313
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,693
...and claimed lordship over these lands.

314
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:26,453
My company are those loyal to Rohan.

315
00:32:26,622 --> 00:32:28,345
And for that, we are banished.

316
00:32:30,302 --> 00:32:33,433
The White Wizard is cunning.

317
00:32:34,141 --> 00:32:36,378
He walks here and there, they say...

318
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:38,557
...as an old man hooded and cloaked.

319
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:43,897
And everywhere, his spies
slip past our nets.

320
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,297
We are no spies.

321
00:32:46,428 --> 00:32:49,242
We track a party of Uruk-hai
westward across the plain.

322
00:32:49,499 --> 00:32:51,671
They have taken two of our friends
captive.

323
00:32:52,476 --> 00:32:54,931
The Uruks are destroyed.
We slaughtered them during the night.

324
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:58,066
But there were two Hobbits.
Did you see two Hobbits with them?

325
00:32:58,202 --> 00:33:01,072
They would be small.
Only children to your eyes.

326
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:06,127
We left none alive.

327
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:09,625
We piled the carcasses and burned them.

328
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,118
Dead?

329
00:33:19,001 --> 00:33:20,527
I am sorry.

330
00:33:25,944 --> 00:33:28,115
Hasufel! Arod!

331
00:33:29,879 --> 00:33:34,385
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.

332
00:33:35,511 --> 00:33:37,104
Farewell.

333
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:44,177
Look for your friends.

334
00:33:44,694 --> 00:33:46,799
But do not trust to hope.

335
00:33:48,309 --> 00:33:50,829
It has forsaken these lands.

336
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,918
We ride north!

337
00:34:41,521 --> 00:34:43,309
It's one of their wee belts.

338
00:34:56,431 --> 00:34:58,340
We failed them.

339
00:35:12,014 --> 00:35:14,054
A Hobbit lay here.

340
00:35:15,885 --> 00:35:17,346
And the other.

341
00:35:27,757 --> 00:35:29,349
They crawled.

342
00:35:33,259 --> 00:35:35,233
Their hands were bound.

343
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,678
Their bonds were cut.

344
00:36:03,432 --> 00:36:05,440
They ran over here.

345
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:10,112
They were followed.

346
00:36:13,352 --> 00:36:14,879
The belt!

347
00:36:18,663 --> 00:36:19,710
Run!

348
00:36:23,334 --> 00:36:24,545
Tracks lead away from the battle...

349
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,164
...into Fangorn Forest.

350
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,531
Fangorn?

351
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:36,090
What madness drove them in there?

352
00:36:53,155 --> 00:36:56,026
Did we lose him? I think we lost him.

353
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:05,727
I'm going to rip out
your filthy little innards!

354
00:37:11,842 --> 00:37:12,790
Come here!

355
00:37:18,017 --> 00:37:20,537
Trees. Climb a tree.

356
00:37:29,408 --> 00:37:31,098
He's gone.

357
00:37:42,687 --> 00:37:44,890
Merry!

358
00:37:55,966 --> 00:38:00,122
Let's put a maggot hole in your belly!

359
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,466
Run, Merry!

360
00:38:17,755 --> 00:38:22,031
Little Orcs.

361
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,342
It's talking, Merry.
The tree is talking.

362
00:38:24,474 --> 00:38:26,329
Tree?

363
00:38:26,459 --> 00:38:29,328
I am no tree!

364
00:38:29,659 --> 00:38:31,730
I am an Ent.

365
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:34,390
A tree-herder.

366
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,696
A shepherd of the forest.

367
00:38:36,825 --> 00:38:38,254
Don't talk to it, Merry.

368
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:40,143
Don't encourage it!

369
00:38:40,313 --> 00:38:44,339
Treebeard, some call me.

370
00:38:44,472 --> 00:38:46,360
And whose side are you on?

371
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,461
Side?

372
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:51,410
I am on nobody's side...

373
00:38:51,864 --> 00:38:56,915
...because nobody's on my side,
little Orc.

374
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:02,224
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.

375
00:39:02,551 --> 00:39:04,788
We're not Orcs! We're Hobbits!

376
00:39:05,078 --> 00:39:07,216
Hobbits?

377
00:39:08,373 --> 00:39:13,076
Never heard of a Hobbit before.

378
00:39:14,198 --> 00:39:18,572
Sounds like Orc mischief to me!

379
00:39:18,742 --> 00:39:20,748
They come with fire.

380
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:23,437
They come with axes.

381
00:39:23,605 --> 00:39:28,242
Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning!

382
00:39:28,405 --> 00:39:32,081
- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!
- No!

383
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,993
You don't understand. We're Hobbits!

384
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:36,911
Halflings!

385
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:38,122
Shire-folk!

386
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:40,593
Maybe you are...

387
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:44,396
...and maybe you aren't.

388
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:49,201
The White Wizard will know.

389
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:51,696
The White Wizard?

390
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:54,607
Saruman.

391
00:40:06,736 --> 00:40:08,394
See? See?

392
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:10,828
We've led you out.

393
00:40:10,959 --> 00:40:13,447
Hurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!

394
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,821
Very lucky we find you.

395
00:40:25,134 --> 00:40:26,826
Nice Hobbit.

396
00:40:29,647 --> 00:40:32,744
It's a bog. He's led us into a swamp.

397
00:40:32,879 --> 00:40:35,463
A swamp, yes, yes.

398
00:40:36,205 --> 00:40:40,645
Come, master. We will take you
on safe paths through the mist.

399
00:40:42,957 --> 00:40:46,218
Come, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.

400
00:40:49,292 --> 00:40:51,878
I found it. I did.

401
00:40:52,044 --> 00:40:54,628
The way through the marshes.

402
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:58,243
Orcs don't use it.
Orcs don't know it.

403
00:40:58,411 --> 00:41:02,306
They go around for miles and miles.

404
00:41:02,475 --> 00:41:03,936
Come quickly.

405
00:41:04,106 --> 00:41:07,968
Soft and quick as shadows we must be.

406
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:12,197
I hate this place. It's too quiet.

407
00:41:12,362 --> 00:41:14,631
There's been no sight nor sound
of a bird for two days.

408
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,925
No, no birdses to eat.

409
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:22,307
No crunchable birdses.

410
00:41:22,793 --> 00:41:25,575
We are famished! Yes!

411
00:41:25,704 --> 00:41:29,960
Famished we are, precious!

412
00:41:44,295 --> 00:41:45,669
Here.

413
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:48,733
What does it eats?

414
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,917
Is it tasty?

415
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:58,363
It tries to chokes us!

416
00:41:58,758 --> 00:42:02,140
We can't eats Hobbit food!

417
00:42:03,845 --> 00:42:07,706
We must starve!

418
00:42:07,844 --> 00:42:10,211
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!

419
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,057
Oh, cruel Hobbit.

420
00:42:13,188 --> 00:42:15,938
It does not care if we be hungry.

421
00:42:16,132 --> 00:42:20,703
Does not care if we should die.

422
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:23,968
Not like master.

423
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:27,390
Master cares.

424
00:42:28,482 --> 00:42:30,304
Master knows.

425
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:34,498
Yes.

426
00:42:34,626 --> 00:42:37,211
Precious.

427
00:42:40,545 --> 00:42:44,091
Once it takes hold of us...

428
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:49,882
...it never lets go.

429
00:42:50,592 --> 00:42:51,672
Don't touch me!

430
00:43:22,717 --> 00:43:24,539
There are dead things!

431
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:26,391
Dead faces in the water.

432
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:34,865
All dead. All rotten.

433
00:43:35,452 --> 00:43:38,932
Elves and Men and Orcses.

434
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:42,639
A great battle long ago.

435
00:43:43,451 --> 00:43:45,174
Dead Marshes.

436
00:43:45,339 --> 00:43:47,990
Yes. Yes, that is their name.

437
00:43:49,499 --> 00:43:51,221
This way.

438
00:43:51,354 --> 00:43:54,037
Don't follow the lights.

439
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:59,512
Careful now! Or Hobbits go down
to join the dead ones...

440
00:43:59,673 --> 00:44:03,567
...and light little candles
of their own.

441
00:44:28,663 --> 00:44:30,157
Frodo!

442
00:45:12,721 --> 00:45:17,261
- Gollum?
- Don't follow the lights.

443
00:45:17,394 --> 00:45:19,215
- Gollum!
- Mr. Frodo!

444
00:45:19,345 --> 00:45:21,167
Are you all right?

445
00:45:48,911 --> 00:45:51,757
So bright.

446
00:45:51,918 --> 00:45:55,595
So beautiful.

447
00:45:55,725 --> 00:45:59,435
Our precious.

448
00:46:00,781 --> 00:46:02,308
What did you say?

449
00:46:02,445 --> 00:46:04,485
Master should be resting.

450
00:46:04,621 --> 00:46:08,515
Master needs to keep up his strength.

451
00:46:10,412 --> 00:46:13,674
- Who are you?
- Mustn't ask us. Not its business.

452
00:46:13,803 --> 00:46:15,145
Gollum. Gollum.

453
00:46:15,308 --> 00:46:17,064
Gandalf told me you were
one of the river-folk.

454
00:46:17,196 --> 00:46:21,286
<i>Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home</i>

455
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,826
He said your life was a sad story.

456
00:46:22,987 --> 00:46:27,394
<i>They do not see what lies ahead
When sun has failed and moon is dead</i>

457
00:46:27,562 --> 00:46:30,432
You were not so very different
from a Hobbit once.

458
00:46:30,571 --> 00:46:32,294
Were you?

459
00:46:34,378 --> 00:46:36,647
Sméagol.

460
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:43,553
What did you call me?

461
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:47,492
That was your name once, wasn't it?

462
00:46:47,945 --> 00:46:50,312
A long time ago.

463
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:53,184
My name.

464
00:46:54,216 --> 00:46:55,558
My name.

465
00:47:02,151 --> 00:47:04,606
Sméagol.

466
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:10,176
Black Riders!

467
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:11,554
Hide! Hide!

468
00:47:21,765 --> 00:47:23,936
Come on, Frodo. Come on!

469
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:27,614
Quick! They will see us!
They will see us!

470
00:47:28,228 --> 00:47:30,847
- I thought they were dead.
- Dead?

471
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:33,795
No, you cannot kill them. No.

472
00:47:59,841 --> 00:48:01,052
Wraiths!

473
00:48:01,217 --> 00:48:03,290
Wraiths on wings!

474
00:48:10,944 --> 00:48:12,919
They are calling for it.

475
00:48:13,088 --> 00:48:16,536
They are calling for the precious.

476
00:48:18,591 --> 00:48:20,598
Mr. Frodo! It's all right.

477
00:48:20,736 --> 00:48:21,913
I'm here.

478
00:48:37,278 --> 00:48:38,838
Hurry, Hobbits.

479
00:48:39,262 --> 00:48:43,057
The Black Gate is very close.

480
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,482
Orc blood.

481
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,744
These are strange tracks.

482
00:49:03,932 --> 00:49:05,873
The air is so close in here.

483
00:49:06,971 --> 00:49:09,360
This forest is old.

484
00:49:10,171 --> 00:49:12,080
Very old.

485
00:49:13,657 --> 00:49:15,958
Full of memory...

486
00:49:18,394 --> 00:49:20,728
...and anger.

487
00:49:26,617 --> 00:49:29,431
The trees are speaking to each other.

488
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,902
Gimli!

489
00:49:31,225 --> 00:49:32,915
Lower your ax.

490
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,322
They have feelings, my friend.

491
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:40,823
The Elves began it.

492
00:49:40,984 --> 00:49:45,391
Waking up the trees,
teaching them to speak.

493
00:49:45,975 --> 00:49:48,179
Talking trees.

494
00:49:48,856 --> 00:49:51,757
What do trees have to talk about?

495
00:49:51,895 --> 00:49:54,894
Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.

496
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:59,731
Something's out there.

497
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,824
What do you see?

498
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:10,730
The White Wizard approaches.

499
00:50:16,629 --> 00:50:20,686
Do not let him speak.
He will put a spell on us.

500
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:32,076
We must be quick.

501
00:50:47,089 --> 00:50:50,504
You are tracking the footsteps
of two young Hobbits.

502
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,365
Where are they?

503
00:50:52,496 --> 00:50:55,976
They passed this way
the day before yesterday.

504
00:50:56,144 --> 00:51:00,169
They met someone they did not expect.

505
00:51:00,495 --> 00:51:02,503
Does that comfort you?

506
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:04,527
Who are you?

507
00:51:05,871 --> 00:51:07,758
Show yourself!

508
00:51:16,301 --> 00:51:18,244
It cannot be.

509
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:22,029
Forgive me.

510
00:51:23,661 --> 00:51:25,548
I mistook you for Saruman.

511
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:28,837
I am Saruman.

512
00:51:30,412 --> 00:51:34,122
Or rather, Saruman
as he should have been.

513
00:51:35,084 --> 00:51:36,426
You fell.

514
00:51:37,932 --> 00:51:40,266
Through fire...

515
00:51:40,396 --> 00:51:41,770
...and water.

516
00:51:43,115 --> 00:51:45,602
<i>From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak...</i>

517
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:49,317
<i>...I fought with the Balrog
of Morgoth.</i>

518
00:52:04,394 --> 00:52:07,044
<i>U ntil at last I threw down
my enemy...</i>

519
00:52:07,177 --> 00:52:11,551
<i>...and smote his ruin
upon the mountainside.</i>

520
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,687
<i>Darkness took me...</i>

521
00:52:20,456 --> 00:52:24,350
<i>...and I strayed out of thought
and time.</i>

522
00:52:25,127 --> 00:52:28,062
<i>Stars wheeled overhead...</i>

523
00:52:28,263 --> 00:52:32,670
<i>...and every day was as long
as a life age of the Earth.</i>

524
00:52:34,694 --> 00:52:36,701
<i>But it was not the end.</i>

525
00:52:36,934 --> 00:52:39,650
<i>I felt life in me again.</i>

526
00:52:41,542 --> 00:52:44,029
<i>I've been sent back...</i>

527
00:52:44,165 --> 00:52:45,572
...until my task is done.

528
00:52:46,021 --> 00:52:47,875
Gandalf.

529
00:52:48,421 --> 00:52:50,309
Gandalf?

530
00:52:50,821 --> 00:52:52,576
Yes.

531
00:52:55,108 --> 00:52:56,864
That was what they used to call me.

532
00:52:59,651 --> 00:53:01,756
Gandalf the Grey.

533
00:53:03,172 --> 00:53:04,732
That was my name.

534
00:53:05,028 --> 00:53:06,336
Gandalf.

535
00:53:08,228 --> 00:53:10,202
I am Gandalf the White.

536
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:16,024
And I come back to you now...

537
00:53:16,194 --> 00:53:18,650
...at the turn of the tide.

538
00:53:19,714 --> 00:53:22,561
One stage of your journey is over.
Another begins.

539
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:26,329
- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.
- Edoras?

540
00:53:27,233 --> 00:53:29,207
That is no short distance!

541
00:53:29,408 --> 00:53:32,474
We hear of trouble in Rohan.
It goes ill with the king.

542
00:53:32,608 --> 00:53:34,583
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.

543
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:38,108
Then we have run all this way for nothing?

544
00:53:38,272 --> 00:53:40,159
Are we to leave those poor Hobbits here...

545
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,442
...in this horrid, dark, dank,
tree-infested...?

546
00:53:46,847 --> 00:53:49,847
I mean, charming...

547
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,663
...quite charming forest.

548
00:53:53,246 --> 00:53:56,824
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.

549
00:53:56,958 --> 00:54:01,081
A great power has been sleeping here
for many long years.

550
00:54:01,213 --> 00:54:04,597
The coming of Merry and Pippin
will be like the falling of small stones...

551
00:54:04,734 --> 00:54:07,897
...that starts an avalanche
in the mountains.

552
00:54:08,029 --> 00:54:10,898
I n one thing you have not changed,
dear friend.

553
00:54:11,196 --> 00:54:14,545
You still speak in riddles.

554
00:54:17,307 --> 00:54:23,385
A thing is about to happen that has not
happened since the Elder Days.

555
00:54:23,707 --> 00:54:27,056
The Ents are going to wake up...

556
00:54:27,675 --> 00:54:31,897
...and find that they are strong.
- Strong?!

557
00:54:32,699 --> 00:54:33,778
Oh, that's good.

558
00:54:33,914 --> 00:54:36,532
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.

559
00:54:37,595 --> 00:54:39,699
Merry and Pippin are quite safe.

560
00:54:39,993 --> 00:54:43,342
I n fact, they are far safer
than you are about to be.

561
00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:47,092
This new Gandalf's more grumpy
than the old one.

562
00:55:08,439 --> 00:55:09,901
That is one of the Mearas...

563
00:55:10,039 --> 00:55:12,755
...unless my eyes are cheated
by some spell.

564
00:55:29,588 --> 00:55:31,857
Shadowfax.

565
00:55:34,228 --> 00:55:36,815
He is the lord of all horses...

566
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:42,002
...and has been my friend
through many dangers.

567
00:55:55,795 --> 00:55:59,142
<i>O rowan mine</i>

568
00:55:59,282 --> 00:56:02,958
<i>I saw you shine</i>

569
00:56:03,121 --> 00:56:06,569
<i>U pon a summer's day</i>

570
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:11,823
<i>U pon your head
How golden-red</i>

571
00:56:12,113 --> 00:56:16,552
<i>The crown you bore aloft</i>

572
00:56:16,847 --> 00:56:19,084
Such a beautiful verse.

573
00:56:19,215 --> 00:56:23,950
- Is it much further?
- Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty.

574
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:27,178
You might call it far, perhaps.

575
00:56:28,047 --> 00:56:31,723
My home lies deep in the forest...

576
00:56:31,886 --> 00:56:35,661
...near the roots of the mountain.

577
00:56:36,975 --> 00:56:40,389
I told Gandalf I would keep you safe.

578
00:56:40,558 --> 00:56:44,387
And safe is where I'll keep you.

579
00:56:44,749 --> 00:56:48,872
I believe you will enjoy this next one too.

580
00:56:49,196 --> 00:56:52,067
It's one of my own compositions.

581
00:56:52,397 --> 00:56:53,509
Right.

582
00:56:53,645 --> 00:56:59,493
<i>Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves</i>

583
00:56:59,661 --> 00:57:04,329
<i>And the dreams of trees unfold</i>

584
00:57:04,491 --> 00:57:10,754
<i>When woodland halls are green and cool</i>

585
00:57:10,891 --> 00:57:14,818
<i>And the wind is in the West</i>

586
00:57:15,338 --> 00:57:17,759
<i>Come back to me</i>

587
00:57:18,378 --> 00:57:22,600
<i>Come back to me</i>

588
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:28,992
<i>And say my land is best</i>

589
00:57:36,072 --> 00:57:39,650
Sleep, little Shirelings.

590
00:57:39,783 --> 00:57:43,296
Heed no nightly noise.

591
00:57:43,431 --> 00:57:47,206
Sleep till morning light.

592
00:57:48,678 --> 00:57:52,802
I have business in the forest.

593
00:57:52,935 --> 00:57:58,149
There are many to call.
Many that must come.

594
00:57:59,461 --> 00:58:03,836
The Shadow lies on Fangorn.

595
00:58:03,973 --> 00:58:09,603
The withering of all woods
is drawing near.

596
00:58:18,756 --> 00:58:22,782
The veiling shadow that glowers
in the east takes shape.

597
00:58:23,588 --> 00:58:25,976
Sauron will suffer no rival.

598
00:58:26,499 --> 00:58:30,557
From the summit of Barad-dûr,
his Eye watches ceaselessly.

599
00:58:30,691 --> 00:58:34,007
But he is not so mighty yet
that he is above fear.

600
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:36,898
Doubt ever gnaws at him.

601
00:58:37,027 --> 00:58:39,393
The rumor has reached him.

602
00:58:39,714 --> 00:58:42,397
The heir of Nûmenor still lives.

603
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:46,080
Sauron fears you, Aragorn.

604
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:49,529
He fears what you may become.

605
00:58:50,689 --> 00:58:53,885
And so he'll strike hard and fast
at the world of Men.

606
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:57,557
He will use his puppet, Saruman,
to destroy Rohan.

607
00:58:57,729 --> 00:58:59,222
War is coming.

608
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:02,872
Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge...

609
00:59:03,007 --> 00:59:05,276
...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.

610
00:59:05,408 --> 00:59:08,985
The king's mind is enslaved,
it's an old device of Saruman's.

611
00:59:09,151 --> 00:59:12,086
His hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.

612
00:59:12,383 --> 00:59:16,790
Sauron and Saruman
are tightening the noose.

613
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:19,637
But for all their cunning...

614
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,327
...we have one advantage.

615
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:26,870
The Ring remains hidden.

616
00:59:27,870 --> 00:59:29,691
And that we should seek to destroy it...

617
00:59:29,853 --> 00:59:32,700
...has not yet entered
their darkest dreams.

618
00:59:33,181 --> 00:59:36,441
And so the weapon of the enemy
is moving towards Mordor...

619
00:59:36,603 --> 00:59:37,946
...in the hands of a Hobbit.

620
00:59:38,237 --> 00:59:42,165
Each day brings it closer
to the fires of Mount Doom.

621
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,720
We must trust now in Frodo.

622
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,646
Everything depends upon speed...

623
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,808
...and the secrecy of his quest.

624
00:59:51,706 --> 00:59:54,838
Do not regret your decision to leave him.

625
00:59:55,707 --> 00:59:58,389
Frodo must finish this task alone.

626
00:59:58,969 --> 01:00:01,336
He's not alone.

627
01:00:01,466 --> 01:00:02,959
Sam went with him.

628
01:00:03,673 --> 01:00:04,786
Did he?

629
01:00:05,081 --> 01:00:09,424
Did he, indeed? Good.

630
01:00:10,074 --> 01:00:12,342
Yes, very good.

631
01:00:20,024 --> 01:00:24,726
The Black Gate of Mordor.

632
01:00:27,383 --> 01:00:29,717
Oh, save us.

633
01:00:35,286 --> 01:00:38,353
My old Gaffer would have a thing or two
to say if he could see us now.

634
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:44,820
Master says to show him
the way into Mordor.

635
01:00:44,982 --> 01:00:48,364
So good Sméagol does,
master says so.

636
01:00:48,501 --> 01:00:49,646
I did.

637
01:00:58,069 --> 01:01:00,010
That's it, then.

638
01:01:01,428 --> 01:01:02,769
We can't get past that.

639
01:01:46,063 --> 01:01:47,308
Look!

640
01:01:47,439 --> 01:01:48,933
The gate.

641
01:01:49,071 --> 01:01:50,183
It's opening!

642
01:01:57,390 --> 01:01:59,299
I can see a way down.

643
01:01:59,886 --> 01:02:02,057
Sam, no!

644
01:02:04,109 --> 01:02:05,353
Master!

645
01:03:25,766 --> 01:03:29,061
- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
- I know, Mr. Frodo.

646
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:32,828
I doubt even these Elvish cloaks
will hide us in there.

647
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:35,137
- Now!
- No!

648
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:37,507
No! No, master!

649
01:03:37,668 --> 01:03:40,538
They catch you! They catch you!

650
01:03:41,892 --> 01:03:44,259
Don't take it to him.

651
01:03:47,075 --> 01:03:49,725
He wants the precious.

652
01:03:49,891 --> 01:03:52,760
Always he is looking for it.

653
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:56,673
And the precious is wanting
to go back to him.

654
01:03:56,868 --> 01:04:00,641
But we mustn't let him have it.

655
01:04:06,849 --> 01:04:08,856
No! There's another way.

656
01:04:09,025 --> 01:04:11,611
More secret. A dark way.

657
01:04:11,874 --> 01:04:15,452
- Why haven't you spoken of this before?
- Because master did not ask.

658
01:04:15,809 --> 01:04:16,791
He's up to something.

659
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,829
Are you saying there's another way
into Mordor?

660
01:04:20,128 --> 01:04:22,615
Yes. There's a path...

661
01:04:22,784 --> 01:04:25,240
...and some stairs.

662
01:04:25,409 --> 01:04:27,066
And then...

663
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:30,363
...a tunnel.

664
01:04:43,774 --> 01:04:45,529
He's led us this far, Sam.

665
01:04:45,662 --> 01:04:47,090
Mr. Frodo, no.

666
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:49,498
He's been true to his word.

667
01:04:54,205 --> 01:04:55,318
No.

668
01:04:57,533 --> 01:04:58,962
Lead the way, Sméagol.

669
01:04:59,644 --> 01:05:03,419
Good Sméagol always helps.

670
01:05:35,993 --> 01:05:36,941
Hello?

671
01:05:39,192 --> 01:05:41,167
Treebeard?

672
01:05:41,848 --> 01:05:43,125
Where has he gone?

673
01:05:43,257 --> 01:05:45,677
I had the loveliest dream last night.

674
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:48,817
There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed.

675
01:05:48,951 --> 01:05:51,438
And we smoked all of it.
And then...

676
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:53,718
...you were sick.

677
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:58,069
I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.

678
01:06:01,334 --> 01:06:03,221
Did you hear that?

679
01:06:10,004 --> 01:06:11,412
There it is again.

680
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:16,652
Something's not right here.
Not right at all.

681
01:06:20,308 --> 01:06:23,122
You just said something... Treeish.

682
01:06:23,283 --> 01:06:27,080
No, I didn't. I was just stretching.

683
01:06:34,419 --> 01:06:36,077
You're taller.

684
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,000
- Who?
- You!

685
01:06:38,322 --> 01:06:39,784
- Than what?
- Than me!

686
01:06:40,338 --> 01:06:42,378
I've always been taller than you.

687
01:06:42,514 --> 01:06:47,020
Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one.
You're the short one.

688
01:06:47,858 --> 01:06:49,232
Please, Merry.

689
01:06:49,361 --> 01:06:53,070
You're what? Three-foot-six? At the most?

690
01:06:53,681 --> 01:06:56,430
Whereas me, I'm pushing 3'7".

691
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,585
3'8"!

692
01:07:02,481 --> 01:07:04,269
Three-foot-eight.

693
01:07:07,184 --> 01:07:09,038
You did something.

694
01:07:14,479 --> 01:07:16,072
Merry, don't! Don't drink it!

695
01:07:16,975 --> 01:07:18,316
Merry!

696
01:07:18,606 --> 01:07:20,810
No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn't have any.

697
01:07:20,942 --> 01:07:24,683
- I want some!
- It could well be dangerous!

698
01:07:24,846 --> 01:07:26,886
Give me it back. Merry!

699
01:07:28,685 --> 01:07:30,093
What's happening?!

700
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,259
It's got my leg!

701
01:07:32,557 --> 01:07:34,050
Merry!

702
01:07:52,586 --> 01:07:54,212
Help!

703
01:08:00,554 --> 01:08:02,377
Away with you.

704
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:04,258
You should not be waking.

705
01:08:04,841 --> 01:08:09,510
Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.

706
01:08:09,992 --> 01:08:12,514
Go to sleep.

707
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:14,631
Away with you.

708
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:18,022
Come, the forest is waking up.

709
01:08:18,505 --> 01:08:20,359
It isn't safe.

710
01:08:22,952 --> 01:08:26,727
The trees have grown wild
and dangerous.

711
01:08:26,857 --> 01:08:29,759
Anger festers in their hearts.

712
01:08:30,599 --> 01:08:32,060
Black are their thoughts.

713
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:34,694
Strong is their hate.

714
01:08:34,855 --> 01:08:37,537
They will harm you if they can.

715
01:08:37,670 --> 01:08:41,150
There are too few of us now.

716
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:45,115
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

717
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,219
Why are there so few of you
when you have lived so long?

718
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:51,585
- Are there Ent children?
- Bru-ra-hroom.

719
01:08:51,716 --> 01:08:57,019
There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.

720
01:08:57,317 --> 01:09:02,303
- Why is that?
- We lost the Entwives.

721
01:09:02,532 --> 01:09:03,808
Oh, I'm sorry.

722
01:09:04,036 --> 01:09:07,811
- How did they die?
- Die? No.

723
01:09:07,972 --> 01:09:11,004
We lost them.

724
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:15,992
And now we cannot find them.

725
01:09:16,164 --> 01:09:22,240
I don't suppose you've seen Entwives
in the Shire?

726
01:09:22,402 --> 01:09:24,768
Can't say that I have.

727
01:09:25,314 --> 01:09:27,288
You, Pip?

728
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:30,999
What do they look like?

729
01:09:33,281 --> 01:09:37,820
I don't remember now.

730
01:09:53,503 --> 01:09:57,277
Edoras and the Golden Hall
of Meduseld.

731
01:09:58,015 --> 01:10:00,633
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan...

732
01:10:01,182 --> 01:10:03,931
<i>...whose mind is overthrown.</i>

733
01:10:04,062 --> 01:10:08,284
<i>Saruman 's hold over King Théoden
is now very strong.</i>

734
01:10:08,798 --> 01:10:11,797
My lord, your son...

735
01:10:12,093 --> 01:10:14,165
...he is dead.

736
01:10:15,549 --> 01:10:17,305
My lord?

737
01:10:18,493 --> 01:10:19,736
Uncle?

738
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:28,409
Will you not go to him?

739
01:10:31,388 --> 01:10:33,624
Will you do nothing?

740
01:10:33,755 --> 01:10:35,665
Be careful what you say.

741
01:10:35,835 --> 01:10:38,039
Do not look for welcome here.

742
01:11:01,081 --> 01:11:05,041
Oh, he must have died
sometime in the night.

743
01:11:05,208 --> 01:11:07,248
What a tragedy for the king...

744
01:11:07,416 --> 01:11:10,262
...to lose his only son and heir.

745
01:11:11,318 --> 01:11:15,726
I understand.
His passing is hard to accept.

746
01:11:15,863 --> 01:11:20,597
Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.

747
01:11:20,726 --> 01:11:22,221
Leave me alone, snake!

748
01:11:23,542 --> 01:11:25,167
Oh, but you are alone.

749
01:11:26,646 --> 01:11:31,250
Who knows what you've spoken
to the darkness...

750
01:11:31,413 --> 01:11:34,761
...in the bitter watches of the night...

751
01:11:34,933 --> 01:11:38,511
...when all your life seems to shrink.

752
01:11:38,644 --> 01:11:42,637
The walls of your bower
closing in about you.

753
01:11:42,804 --> 01:11:47,244
A hutch to trammel some wild thing in.

754
01:11:49,364 --> 01:11:51,185
So fair.

755
01:11:52,371 --> 01:11:53,779
So cold.

756
01:11:55,379 --> 01:11:57,549
Like a morning of pale spring...

757
01:11:57,714 --> 01:12:00,944
...still clinging to winter's chill.

758
01:12:14,194 --> 01:12:16,495
Your words are poison.

759
01:13:45,352 --> 01:13:47,653
You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.

760
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:05,187
I cannot allow you before Théoden King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame.

761
01:14:06,534 --> 01:14:09,054
By order of Grima Wormtongue.

762
01:14:25,667 --> 01:14:27,391
Your staff.

763
01:14:30,596 --> 01:14:34,011
You would not part an old man
from his walking stick.

764
01:14:52,066 --> 01:14:54,684
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

765
01:15:02,752 --> 01:15:04,159
He's a herald of woe.

766
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:08,662
The courtesy of your hall
is somewhat lessened of late...

767
01:15:09,696 --> 01:15:11,004
...Théoden King.

768
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:14,230
He's not welcome.

769
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:20,186
Why should I welcome you...

770
01:15:20,607 --> 01:15:24,152
...Gandalf Stormcrow?

771
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:27,581
A just question, my liege.

772
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:30,492
Late is the hour...

773
01:15:30,622 --> 01:15:34,418
...in which this conjurer
chooses to appear.

774
01:15:35,229 --> 01:15:37,203
Láthspell I name him.

775
01:15:37,341 --> 01:15:40,155
Ill news is an ill guest.

776
01:15:40,284 --> 01:15:44,560
Be silent. Keep your forked tongue
behind your teeth.

777
01:15:44,891 --> 01:15:46,681
I have not passed
through fire and death...

778
01:15:46,812 --> 01:15:49,878
...to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm.

779
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:52,818
His staff.

780
01:15:52,987 --> 01:15:56,915
I told you to take the wizard's staff.

781
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:02,105
Théoden...

782
01:16:02,555 --> 01:16:05,075
...son of Thengel...

783
01:16:06,842 --> 01:16:09,046
...too long have you sat
in the Shadows.

784
01:16:11,897 --> 01:16:14,996
I would stay still if I were you.

785
01:16:15,129 --> 01:16:17,104
Hearken to me!

786
01:16:22,457 --> 01:16:24,496
I release you...

787
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:26,551
...from the spell.

788
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:40,588
You have no power here...

789
01:16:40,759 --> 01:16:44,270
...Gandalf the Grey.

790
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:54,251
I will draw you, Saruman,
as poison is drawn from a wound.

791
01:17:03,252 --> 01:17:04,779
Wait.

792
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:09,810
If I go, Théoden dies.

793
01:17:10,515 --> 01:17:12,587
You did not kill me...

794
01:17:12,755 --> 01:17:14,991
...you will not kill him.

795
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:20,270
Rohan is mine.

796
01:17:21,778 --> 01:17:22,989
Be gone.

797
01:18:05,582 --> 01:18:07,753
I know your face.

798
01:18:12,045 --> 01:18:13,222
Éowyn.

799
01:18:15,565 --> 01:18:16,711
Éowyn.

800
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:25,733
Gandalf?

801
01:18:26,347 --> 01:18:29,097
Breathe the free air again, my friend.

802
01:18:41,835 --> 01:18:44,387
Dark have been my dreams of late.

803
01:18:48,330 --> 01:18:51,974
Your fingers would remember
their old strength better...

804
01:18:52,138 --> 01:18:54,984
...if they grasped your sword.

805
01:19:38,213 --> 01:19:40,122
I've only...

806
01:19:40,260 --> 01:19:43,162
...ever served you, my lord.

807
01:19:43,333 --> 01:19:48,122
Your leechcraft would have had me
crawling on all fours like a beast!

808
01:19:49,093 --> 01:19:50,948
Send me not from your sight.

809
01:19:53,284 --> 01:19:55,772
No, my lord! No, my lord.

810
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:57,212
Let him go.

811
01:19:57,795 --> 01:20:01,023
Enough blood has been spilt
on his account.

812
01:20:09,762 --> 01:20:11,932
Get out of my way!

813
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:17,213
Hail, Théoden King!

814
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:43,190
Where is Théodred?

815
01:20:46,078 --> 01:20:48,446
Where is my son?

816
01:22:12,054 --> 01:22:13,744
Simbelmynë.

817
01:22:18,676 --> 01:22:22,190
Ever has it grown on the tombs
of my forebearers.

818
01:22:25,909 --> 01:22:28,756
Now it shall cover the grave
of my son.

819
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:34,450
Alas that these evil days
should be mine.

820
01:22:35,252 --> 01:22:39,408
The young perish and the old linger.

821
01:22:40,051 --> 01:22:42,025
That I should live...

822
01:22:42,163 --> 01:22:45,359
...to see the last days of my house.

823
01:22:46,481 --> 01:22:50,224
Théodred's death
was not of your making.

824
01:22:53,138 --> 01:22:56,487
No parent should have to bury
their child.

825
01:23:12,432 --> 01:23:14,253
He was strong in life.

826
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:18,758
His spirit will find its way
to the halls of your fathers.

827
01:24:01,611 --> 01:24:03,268
They had no warning.

828
01:24:03,594 --> 01:24:05,832
They were unarmed.

829
01:24:06,347 --> 01:24:10,209
Now the Wild Men are moving through
the Westfold, burning as they go.

830
01:24:11,147 --> 01:24:12,869
Rick, cot and tree.

831
01:24:13,258 --> 01:24:15,363
Where is Mama?

832
01:24:16,138 --> 01:24:20,164
This is but a taste of the terror
that Saruman will unleash.

833
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:24,585
All the more potent for he is driven now
by fear of Sauron.

834
01:24:26,025 --> 01:24:28,894
Ride out and meet him head on.

835
01:24:29,641 --> 01:24:32,901
Draw him away from your women
and children.

836
01:24:33,352 --> 01:24:34,813
You must fight.

837
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:38,657
You have 2000 good men riding north
as we speak.

838
01:24:38,951 --> 01:24:40,412
Éomer is loyal to you.

839
01:24:40,551 --> 01:24:43,202
His men will return
and fight for their king.

840
01:24:43,335 --> 01:24:47,108
They will be 300 leagues from here
by now.

841
01:24:50,662 --> 01:24:52,767
Éomer cannot help us.

842
01:24:53,414 --> 01:24:55,007
I know what it is you want of me...

843
01:24:55,333 --> 01:24:58,399
...but I will not bring further death
to my people.

844
01:25:00,068 --> 01:25:01,563
I will not risk open war.

845
01:25:03,685 --> 01:25:07,002
Open war is upon you,
whether you would risk it or not.

846
01:25:11,076 --> 01:25:12,668
When last I looked...

847
01:25:13,028 --> 01:25:16,573
...Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.

848
01:25:23,139 --> 01:25:25,278
Then what is the king's decision?

849
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:31,900
<i>By order of the king...</i>

850
01:25:32,066 --> 01:25:33,374
...the city must empty.

851
01:25:34,658 --> 01:25:37,407
We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep.

852
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:41,407
Do not burden yourself with treasures.
Take only what provisions you need.

853
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:42,944
Helm's Deep.

854
01:25:43,233 --> 01:25:46,527
They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight.

855
01:25:46,687 --> 01:25:48,575
Who will defend them if not their king?

856
01:25:48,704 --> 01:25:51,160
He's only doing what he thinks
is best for his people.

857
01:25:51,296 --> 01:25:53,052
Helm's Deep has saved them
in the past.

858
01:25:53,184 --> 01:25:56,959
There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap.

859
01:25:57,088 --> 01:25:59,160
He thinks he's leading them to safety.

860
01:25:59,295 --> 01:26:01,499
What they will get is a massacre.

861
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:05,365
Théoden has a strong will,
but I fear for him.

862
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:09,369
I fear for the survival of Rohan.

863
01:26:09,758 --> 01:26:12,540
He will need you before the end,
Aragorn.

864
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:15,606
The people of Rohan will need you.

865
01:26:16,093 --> 01:26:18,361
The defenses have to hold.

866
01:26:19,837 --> 01:26:21,561
They will hold.

867
01:26:25,405 --> 01:26:27,543
The Grey Pilgrim.

868
01:26:27,709 --> 01:26:30,262
That's what they used to call me.

869
01:26:30,428 --> 01:26:35,283
Three hundred lives of Men I've walked
this earth, and now I have no time.

870
01:26:36,732 --> 01:26:38,968
With luck, my search will not
be in vain.

871
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:42,680
Look to my coming at first light
on the fifth day.

872
01:26:43,387 --> 01:26:46,004
At dawn, look to the east.

873
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:47,731
Go.

874
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:17,044
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There's nothing you can do. Leave him.

875
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:56,586
His name is Brego.

876
01:27:57,972 --> 01:27:59,793
He was my cousin's horse.

877
01:27:59,987 --> 01:28:01,743
Brego.

878
01:28:03,283 --> 01:28:05,802
Your name is kingly.

879
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:18,125
I have heard of the magic of Elves...

880
01:28:18,257 --> 01:28:21,552
...but I did not look for it
in a Ranger from the North.

881
01:28:22,545 --> 01:28:24,781
You speak as one of their own.

882
01:28:26,577 --> 01:28:28,813
I was raised in Rivendell...

883
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,575
...for a time.

884
01:28:33,711 --> 01:28:35,816
Turn this fellow free.

885
01:28:36,336 --> 01:28:38,792
He's seen enough of war.

886
01:28:49,966 --> 01:28:52,749
Gandalf the White.

887
01:28:52,879 --> 01:28:55,245
Gandalf the Fool!

888
01:28:56,430 --> 01:29:00,291
Does he seek to humble me
with his newfound piety?

889
01:29:01,452 --> 01:29:05,249
There were three
who followed the wizard.

890
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:10,791
An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.

891
01:29:11,116 --> 01:29:13,734
You stink of horse.

892
01:29:18,763 --> 01:29:20,586
The Man...

893
01:29:22,539 --> 01:29:26,695
...was he from Gondor?
- No, from the North.

894
01:29:26,827 --> 01:29:30,503
One of the Dûnedain Rangers,
I thought he was.

895
01:29:30,666 --> 01:29:32,389
His cloth was poor.

896
01:29:33,129 --> 01:29:38,181
And yet he bore a strange ring.

897
01:29:39,242 --> 01:29:42,536
Two serpents with emerald eyes.

898
01:29:42,697 --> 01:29:48,326
One devouring,
the other crowned with golden flowers.

899
01:29:48,457 --> 01:29:50,278
The Ring of Barahir.

900
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:54,721
So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found Isildur's heir.

901
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:58,020
The lost king of Gondor.
He is a fool.

902
01:29:58,312 --> 01:30:00,831
The line was broken years ago.

903
01:30:02,247 --> 01:30:03,621
It matters not.

904
01:30:03,783 --> 01:30:06,270
The world of Men shall fall.

905
01:30:06,406 --> 01:30:08,230
It will begin at Edoras.

906
01:30:16,966 --> 01:30:18,820
I am ready, Gamling.

907
01:30:18,981 --> 01:30:21,403
Bring my horse.

908
01:30:24,453 --> 01:30:25,697
This is not a defeat.

909
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:29,245
We will return.

910
01:30:34,404 --> 01:30:36,793
We will return.

911
01:30:59,169 --> 01:31:01,056
You have some skill with a blade.

912
01:31:09,249 --> 01:31:11,223
Women of this country learned long ago:

913
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:13,782
Those without swords
can still die upon them.

914
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,705
I fear neither death nor pain.

915
01:31:17,024 --> 01:31:19,031
What do you fear, my lady?

916
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:24,028
A cage.

917
01:31:25,215 --> 01:31:28,924
To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them.

918
01:31:29,055 --> 01:31:32,829
And all chance of valor has gone
beyond recall or desire.

919
01:31:36,222 --> 01:31:38,130
You're a daughter of kings...

920
01:31:39,325 --> 01:31:42,456
...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.

921
01:31:47,644 --> 01:31:49,979
I do not think that would be your fate.

922
01:32:21,658 --> 01:32:24,527
<i>Théoden will not stay at Edoras.</i>

923
01:32:24,697 --> 01:32:26,672
It's vulnerable. He knows this.

924
01:32:27,001 --> 01:32:29,783
He will expect an attack on the city.

925
01:32:31,001 --> 01:32:34,066
They will flee to Helm's Deep...

926
01:32:34,232 --> 01:32:36,566
...the great fortress of Rohan.

927
01:32:37,687 --> 01:32:41,844
<i>It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains.</i>

928
01:32:43,319 --> 01:32:44,846
<i>They will be slow.</i>

929
01:32:45,335 --> 01:32:49,525
They will have women and children
with them.

930
01:32:53,237 --> 01:32:55,377
Send out your Warg-riders.

931
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:12,435
Hey, stinker, don't go getting
too far ahead.

932
01:33:12,565 --> 01:33:15,150
- Why do you do that?
- What?

933
01:33:15,315 --> 01:33:17,803
Call him names.
Run him down all the time.

934
01:33:18,164 --> 01:33:20,105
Because.

935
01:33:21,651 --> 01:33:23,658
Because that's what he is, Mr. Frodo.

936
01:33:23,827 --> 01:33:25,899
There's naught left in him
but lies and deceit.

937
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:28,939
It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.

938
01:33:29,235 --> 01:33:31,373
You have no idea what it did to him...

939
01:33:31,507 --> 01:33:33,807
...what it's still doing to him.

940
01:33:36,081 --> 01:33:38,055
I want to help him, Sam.

941
01:33:38,193 --> 01:33:39,371
Why?

942
01:33:44,594 --> 01:33:47,560
Because I have to believe
he can come back.

943
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,454
You can't save him, Mr. Frodo.

944
01:33:53,615 --> 01:33:56,267
What do you know about it?
Nothing!

945
01:34:02,862 --> 01:34:06,855
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know
why I said that.

946
01:34:07,695 --> 01:34:08,775
I do.

947
01:34:10,735 --> 01:34:12,524
It's the Ring.

948
01:34:13,007 --> 01:34:14,533
You can't take your eyes off it.

949
01:34:15,310 --> 01:34:17,198
I've seen you.

950
01:34:17,582 --> 01:34:21,290
You're not eating. You barely sleep.

951
01:34:23,021 --> 01:34:25,125
It's taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.

952
01:34:25,260 --> 01:34:27,912
- You have to fight it.
- I know what I have to do, Sam.

953
01:34:28,045 --> 01:34:30,860
The Ring was entrusted to me.
It's my task.

954
01:34:31,021 --> 01:34:32,711
Mine! My own!

955
01:34:33,548 --> 01:34:35,555
Can't you hear yourself?

956
01:34:35,693 --> 01:34:37,350
Don't you know who you sound like?

957
01:34:47,179 --> 01:34:49,185
We wants it.

958
01:34:49,323 --> 01:34:51,973
We needs it.

959
01:34:52,106 --> 01:34:56,743
Must have the precious.

960
01:34:56,906 --> 01:35:00,037
They stole it from us.

961
01:35:00,362 --> 01:35:03,525
Sneaky little Hobbitses.

962
01:35:03,657 --> 01:35:07,431
Wicked. Tricksy. False.

963
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:10,626
No. Not master.

964
01:35:10,953 --> 01:35:14,498
Yes, precious. False.

965
01:35:14,793 --> 01:35:19,015
They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!

966
01:35:20,103 --> 01:35:22,524
Master's my friend.

967
01:35:22,695 --> 01:35:27,517
You don't have any friends.
Nobody likes you.

968
01:35:28,711 --> 01:35:31,166
Not listening. I'm not listening.

969
01:35:31,335 --> 01:35:35,163
You're a liar and a thief.

970
01:35:35,846 --> 01:35:37,253
No.

971
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:40,931
Murderer.

972
01:35:43,238 --> 01:35:44,186
Go away.

973
01:35:44,517 --> 01:35:46,721
Go away?

974
01:35:48,645 --> 01:35:51,362
I hate you.

975
01:35:51,492 --> 01:35:53,728
I hate you.

976
01:35:54,148 --> 01:35:57,247
Where would you be without me?
Gollum. Gollum.

977
01:35:57,412 --> 01:35:59,201
I saved us.

978
01:35:59,332 --> 01:36:03,739
It was me. We survived because of me.

979
01:36:04,867 --> 01:36:08,215
Not anymore.

980
01:36:09,634 --> 01:36:11,041
What did you say?

981
01:36:13,027 --> 01:36:16,735
Master looks after us now.

982
01:36:16,866 --> 01:36:20,281
We don't need you.

983
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:22,433
What?

984
01:36:22,561 --> 01:36:24,284
Leave now...

985
01:36:24,449 --> 01:36:28,126
...and never come back.

986
01:36:28,257 --> 01:36:29,205
No.

987
01:36:29,793 --> 01:36:33,786
Leave now and never come back.

988
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:42,048
Leave now and never come back!

989
01:36:53,502 --> 01:36:55,957
We told him to go away.

990
01:36:56,093 --> 01:36:58,963
And away he goes, precious.

991
01:36:59,263 --> 01:37:00,985
Gone! Gone! Gone!

992
01:37:01,309 --> 01:37:03,097
Sméagol is free!

993
01:37:07,644 --> 01:37:09,139
Look.

994
01:37:09,277 --> 01:37:13,685
Look. See what Sméagol finds?

995
01:37:22,748 --> 01:37:24,024
They are young.

996
01:37:24,347 --> 01:37:26,680
They are tender. They are nice.

997
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:30,258
Yes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!

998
01:37:32,923 --> 01:37:34,352
You'll make him sick, you will...

999
01:37:35,482 --> 01:37:37,718
...behaving like that.

1000
01:37:39,961 --> 01:37:42,679
There's only one way to eat
a brace of coneys.

1001
01:37:46,681 --> 01:37:48,241
What's it doing?

1002
01:37:48,792 --> 01:37:51,345
Stupid, fat Hobbit.

1003
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:53,552
It ruins it.

1004
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:57,232
What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat
on them.

1005
01:38:01,208 --> 01:38:03,728
What we need is a few good taters.

1006
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:07,501
What's taters, precious?

1007
01:38:07,671 --> 01:38:09,362
What's taters? Eh?

1008
01:38:09,495 --> 01:38:11,218
Po-ta-toes.

1009
01:38:11,478 --> 01:38:14,544
Boil them, mash them,
stick them in a stew.

1010
01:38:16,086 --> 01:38:21,268
Lovely, big, golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.

1011
01:38:22,485 --> 01:38:24,307
Even you couldn't say no to that.

1012
01:38:24,757 --> 01:38:26,796
Oh, yes, we could.

1013
01:38:26,964 --> 01:38:30,380
Spoil a nice fish.

1014
01:38:31,573 --> 01:38:33,994
Give it to us raw...

1015
01:38:34,292 --> 01:38:37,194
...and wriggling.

1016
01:38:37,332 --> 01:38:40,299
You keep nasty chips.

1017
01:38:41,235 --> 01:38:43,178
You're hopeless.

1018
01:38:55,090 --> 01:38:56,584
Mr. Frodo?

1019
01:39:13,777 --> 01:39:16,394
- Who are they?
- Wicked Men.

1020
01:39:16,528 --> 01:39:18,830
Servants of Sauron.

1021
01:39:19,632 --> 01:39:21,703
They are called to Mordor.

1022
01:39:21,839 --> 01:39:24,741
The Dark One is gathering all armies
to him.

1023
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:28,038
It won't be long now.
He will soon be ready.

1024
01:39:29,487 --> 01:39:33,032
- Ready to do what?
- To make his war.

1025
01:39:33,199 --> 01:39:38,119
The last war that will cover
all the world in Shadow.

1026
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:41,412
We've got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

1027
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:42,695
Mr. Frodo.

1028
01:39:43,278 --> 01:39:44,706
Look.

1029
01:39:48,205 --> 01:39:50,376
It's an oliphaunt.

1030
01:39:58,220 --> 01:40:01,090
No one at home will believe this.

1031
01:40:11,786 --> 01:40:13,610
Sméagol?

1032
01:40:52,390 --> 01:40:54,691
We've lingered here too long.

1033
01:40:57,574 --> 01:40:58,784
Come on, Sam.

1034
01:41:11,812 --> 01:41:14,464
Wait! We're innocent travelers!

1035
01:41:15,973 --> 01:41:20,860
There are no travelers in this land.
Only servants of the Dark Tower.

1036
01:41:21,156 --> 01:41:23,970
We are bound to an errand of secrecy.

1037
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:28,383
Those that claim to oppose the enemy
would do well not to hinder us.

1038
01:41:28,515 --> 01:41:30,653
The enemy?

1039
01:41:32,644 --> 01:41:35,904
His sense of duty was no less
than yours, I deem.

1040
01:41:38,338 --> 01:41:40,280
You wonder what his name is...

1041
01:41:41,666 --> 01:41:43,804
...where he came from.

1042
01:41:45,697 --> 01:41:48,119
And if he was really evil at heart.

1043
01:41:49,793 --> 01:41:53,021
What lies or threats led him
on this long march from home.

1044
01:41:54,656 --> 01:41:56,925
If he would not rather have stayed there...

1045
01:41:59,007 --> 01:42:00,536
...in peace.

1046
01:42:03,871 --> 01:42:06,773
War will make corpses of us all.

1047
01:42:07,071 --> 01:42:09,045
Bind their hands.
